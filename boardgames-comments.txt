Version 3.6.0 of praw is outdated. Version 4.0.0 was released 1 day ago.
Anyone have any advice about how to prevent that terrible white/grey worn fold line forming on folding boards? 

I know some people frame the board to keep it flat, but I don't have the space to store that...
I'm trying to find a game to play with my dad.  I'm very much into games of the video variety, but I've also quite enjoyed playing a digital version of the LOTR LCG by myself and with a friend of mine.  My dad doesn't game (of any variety) much at all.  He enjoys playing games on Facebook that mimic casino games (slots, etc.) and comparably simple games.  I think these are the criteria I'm looking for:

* Enough complexity for me, but not too complex for him

* Cooperative, I think, but open to competitive games

* Plays well with one person (me) and I'll enjoy it, in case he doesn't

I ordered an LOTR LCG core set and Mage Knight base game for myself because I'm interested in them.  I'm not sure if he'll like them.  I haven't had the opportunity to play either with him yet.
I'm about to start painting up my miniatures from SDE:FK - I have no idea on undercoat brands (i will be looking to use black or grey).

I'd appreciate any recommendations (I'm in Melb, Aus for availability if that matters). Thanks very much!
For a game group that has never played D&D or any game with miniatures but may be willing to try them out, including myself. Is jumping into the KD:M Kickstarter too ambitious and crazy to start off with?
My group really likes **Betrayal at the House on the Hill**, mostly for the shortish play time, the random board building, an horror themes. Are there any other games out there with similar mechanics that we might enjoy?
My gaming group is mostly 3, sometimes 4 players and we meet up pretty much every weekend.  I really want to buy **Battlestar Galactica** but am reluctant because I have read it is so much better with 5 players than any other number.  Is it worth buying if we will only have 4 players max?
When playing Dominion with multiple expansions, how do you decide which additional victory/treasure cards to use, if any? 
Are there other board games that uses a supply and demand mechanic similar to Power Grid's Resources, where it replenishes at a certain rate at various parts of the game?
I store my board games in the trunk of my car. Well, Winter is coming and it has started to snow over here with weather ranging from 40s to 10s. Is it okay to leave them in the trunk of my car? Should I be concerned when I pull them out and they're really cold?
EDIT: I'm hearing mixed reviews so back to square one I guess
I just got Power grid and it came with plastic baggies, but I am not sure how to divide it as there aren't as many baggies as there are types of pieces. How should they be put away, as its REALLY bothering me!

Played King of Tokyo last night for the first time with my 6yo at the library. Can you have more than one card in your hand? The ones that you can buy off the board with energy cubes?
Does any one know a service that creates board game PLASTIC decks with ink laminated within the card? I have a few board game decks and card games that get used often and have had to buy multiple decks for. 

An example is uno splash, they have a version of durable plastic cards, but they print on top of the card the the ink starts to fade out because the ink isn't embedded within the plastic card.

I also bought exploding cats for thanksgiving and everyone loved it but the card quality isn't great so some of the edges are starting to fray already.

I would definitely be willing to pay extra to order more durable sets of the games I most love but I couldn't find anything online!
I recently bought Risk: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition for my girlfriend from someone online. It wasn't in manufacturer packaging (didn't expect it to be) and me being the clean freak I am, I want to clean it all up before giving it to her. How can I clean the little plastic pieces, dice, and cards without damaging any of them? I was thinking of placing the plastic figures in a bowl of water with a drop of Dawn but I'm afraid it'll damage the plastic.
With the holidays coming up, what would you suggest as a gift to someone who likes:

-Ascension Deckbuilder

-Dominion

-Catan

-Magic TCG

-Munchkin
Is it just me, or were the boardgaming deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year just...not exciting? Even the non-boardgaming ones seemed lackluster. Am I just getting cynical with age?
Does anybody have any good entry level miniature game suggestions? I really want to get into more story driven rpg like games but A) don't have a group of friends who like board games like I do in my area so hard to find people to introduce me to new games and B) my wife like board games and plays with me but some of the more complex rpg ones she isn't huge on but is willing to try.  

So if anybody knows and suggestions for good ones that I can either play solo as a newbie to the genre or can play as 2 people that is easy enough for her to grasp would be prefered.  


Thank you in advance all!
In this thread:

People that don't have the game - "What!? It's overpriced!"

People that have the game - "It's worth it! It's a beautiful game!"

Shots fired.
I am in Germany and got the game on Kickstarter, only realised after I backed it that neither me nor my friends are the kind of people for this sort of bluffing game - I backed it after the CAH guys recommended it and was hoping for something more down that alley. 

Anyway, if you want the game and are in Europe, I am gladly selling it for 15€+shipping but not in the wooden box, just in the cardboard box that was inside the wooden one. 

EDIT: Got all your messages and will work through them in the first come first serve fashion.
Now if only I got my copy I bought 6 months ago at PAX East
Got it on Kickstarter, still waiting for my pledge to come in.
I bought it immediately. I spent some time making my print and play version decent and my group has gotten a lot of mileage out of it (we're normally "party-sized"). 

The price doesn't bother me and I probably would have picked it up even if it cost more - I haven't been into board games for that long and don't have that many of them. Video games are my primary hobby, so when I see $35 I think, "that's pretty cheap!"
Wow this price... Triple what **Resistance** costs. I guess I'll stick to the print-n-play for now.
This seriously frustrates me that I paid (more) for this game almost a year ago and I still haven't gotten my copy. Yet anyone with Amazon prime can get it at anytime. Sigh.
It's complete BS that it is available on Amazon before PAX East buyers even get shipping emails.
Still haven't gotten the copy I bought at PAX East...
We pre-ordered this game from them at pax east 2016. We have been given the run around for months now. We were supposed ro receive it in may, then it was june, then september, then november, and still no sign of it.

My friend is in the same boat. Wtf we ordered this game almost a year ago. What gives? How do we get a copy that we are owed? This is ridiculous.
I admit I'm not sure I'll pick this up. I've definitely used up my board game budget for the year, plus I'm considering Avalon instead. Anyone play both and have any advice (when I can afford it next year)?
Lots of people ITT complaining about the $35 price tag.  I bought it on Kickstarter and spent US$62 to get it in Canada (with the wooden box) and I think it was worth every cent.  
  
Everyone I've played this with loves it!  Every time it's played, the games keep going for hours and hours and no one wants to quit.  It's a lot of fun and seriously worth the $35 if you can afford it.  If not, there's a free printable version on their website :)
You guys are monsters, it's already sold out :(
ugh that site could use some work. overflowing text, unecessary hover events. all that scrolling. im sure the background gif doesnt play nice on mobile, not to mention its super distracting.
Does it still have player elimination? I remember having a problem with that when the Kickstarter launched and hoped they will change that rule. In a specific game test we did in our group, I was eliminated first and waited 30 minutes for the game to end, looking at everyone else. That never happened to me with other Resistance-like games.
Got it through KS a while back. Game is disappointing. Fascists have a really hard time to win. All the liberals need to find are two people not sitting next to each other and keep picking each other to be chancellors when they are presidents. Two free liberal policies before it gets back to your turn.
Hopefully that means I'll be receiving my PAX East order of it very soon. Excited!
US only noo! 

I have been waiting to get a legit copy forever.. Hopefully some Australian site will have it before xmas.
I'd buy it but amazon is sold out and I'm not putting my cc info into their website until they fix their SSL.
Had it a few months now - beautifully made and plenty replayable. Worth the money. 
The components of Secret Hitler are gorgeous and the price seems fair.
I maintain my two criticisms of this game, the first being that the title is the product equivalent of clickbait, and the second being that *Avalon* is still categorically a better game. Regardless, I wish them well and it's always good to see another small publisher making it work.
Great, released for the US in time for Christmas, the rest of the world will have to wait.

Such a shame as I played it a couple of weeks ago and it is great.
Been waiting for this for awhile! Just placed my order. 
Ok, I'm gonna bite and ask the question... What the living hell is with the random downvotes all the way through this post? Like, there's heaps of people who are having a perfectly civil conversation or posting factual information with their comments sitting on zero.
I like it better than Avalon, but not as much as having $35. 
Yeah wow, I got the text the second I opened this. Freaked me out a little. Unfortunately I already spent my allotted fun money last night. 
I mean the game is fun, but it isn't really better than The Resistance. The components look nice, but 35$ is just a ridiculous price. This might be a case where the game is overproduced.
I really liked this game for a while till we found what I considered an bug in the game. the group would only vote for the same person to be the chancellor that they believed to be a liberal. That person passed liberal policies only so that must be a liberal is what the thinking is. If you went against voting the same person for chancellor then you are labeled as the fascist and will get immediately vetoed every time. Maybe I missed it in the rules for the print-and-play but as far as what we interpreted, you can make the same person chancellor over and over again. its has made the game pretty pointless to me. Vote the same person as chancellor or get labeled. 

Any one else experience this issue?
US only :(((
No canadian love ... :(
Is there any way to purchase a re-skinned version of this game that still sends revenue to Goat, Wolf, and Cabbage? 

Love the mechanics, have printed and played two different versions, but don't really like the theming as inclusive enough to let ANYONE in my office play. 
Speaking as someone who backed it on kickstarter, I have to say that although I haven't had a lot of chance to play it I'm glad I did. The art is beautiful, I can't understand why anyone would stick the dumb stickers they included all over it.
Excited for an EU release eventually! Price might be a bit high but I still think I'll get it. My group loves these kinds of games.
Already sold out on amazon by the time this hit my front page :'(
Sorry, that was not super clear. Because of the Hitler theme, I think there are people who would be uncomfortable enough that is rather not take it into the office. 
I really would never recommend this game. That's coming from someone who really enjoys it and thinks it a solid game.

Secret Hitler's fatal flaw is that it will forever stand in the shadow of Avalon. No game of this style has striken that balance between the deductive and social elements quite like Avalon. I hope one day we see a major improvement to hidden role game formula, but for now Secret Hitler is just a more shallow Avalon.
Isn't this a slight modification on the theme of The Resistance?
Just got the text as well, came here to make sure someone posted it!
I got excited after getting the text. But I think $35 is way too steep right now. I'd rather get Avalon or resistance at that price.
Seems unsafe to buy from their website as they don't have an SSL certificate.
I didn't realize this required such a high player count.  Is it possible to play at less than 5? 
This looks cool, but I'll never have 5 people at my table. Most of my games max out at 5.
The Cards Against Humanity people said they should be up at retailers in 2017
It's not even listed on Amazon anymore.  Sold out?
seems OOS on amazon.
Why wouldn't they make it international from the start?  That really sucks.
I was just telling /u/lumpy_snake about this.
lasted less than 10 minutes.
It is unavailable on Amazon right now

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JKD4HYC
Friend got it in the kickstarter, played it and loved it.

Went to PAX AUS and there was a kiosk that had like 30 copies of it, was so excited to pick it up!...

... but they were selling it for AU$95 (USD$71).

Kindly told them to go die in a hole with the markup they were abusing on its scarcity.
Really happy I jumped on it as soon as I saw this thread. After the nightmare that was getting my hands on a copy of Scythe, I wasn't going to wait.
Wait. I played this months ago...in Australia. Had no idea it was hard to get hold of. Wish I'd appreciated the experience more... :/
Why am I saying it to the tune of the Funky Pigeon .com advert?
Ive been looking forward to this one for a while, does anybody have any idea when they expect to be able to ship to europe?
Excellent! I will have to get it via import in the UK but I am dying to get hold of this at the moment.
Currently unavailable, at least on Amazon.  Sold out I assume.
$35 for a mediocre hidden identity game is a ripoff. Buying **The Resistance** for $10 is a much better deal.
These creators are going to look like complete idiots after Donald Trump runs a moderate republican presidency. They are the same style of people that thought Obama was a secret Muslim communist. So retarded lol. 
Welcome to the hobby! It sounds like you're having a blast. Settlers of Catan was the game I grew up playing with my family, and I've had many good times and tense games with it!
Congrats on your first go-around with Catan!  ...and be careful with all of those wheats -- someone might roll a 7...

And suddenly someone uses monopole card and no more wheat nor wealth. Been there, suffered that

Anyhow, Catan is one of the best gateway games you can have.
Ah, the wheat empire-classic rookie mistake. Sheep empire is always the way to go. Because building cities and roads out of sheep is way funnier to me. I just picture my people living in houses made out of live sheep stacked on top of one-another and travelling from place to place on the plushest roads imaginable.
Having played mostly non-euros before that.

That moment where the setup phase told me to double back the selection of starting positions was an eye opener - "Holy shit this game cares about game balance"
I play monopoly on Wheat.
Welcome to the hobby, Catan did it's job and brought you in. Very successful gateway game! Glad you liked it!
Oh you lucky person. I remember the feeling of playing Catan for the first time and it was great. Also the weeks afterward were Catan every night.

I recently introduced a friend to Catan as well and now I'm very envious of that new-great-game-feeling.
Settlers of Catan was the gateway game for a lot of people here. There's lots of even better games waiting when you are ready for them too. Enjoy!
Is Catan easier than Agricola?
Welcome to the hobby! It sounds like you're having a blast. Settlers of Catan was the game I grew up playing with my family, and I've had many good times and tense games with it!
Welcome!
You best savor and enjoy the countless hours you will be spend playing Catan, as after that, it's just more and more and MORE other awesome board games waiting for you, to consume your soul and wallet and to make you feel like you can conquer the world with your high and mighty plays!

Also, have fun!
I think Euros should be played according to some of the best advice I got for learning **Go**:

*"Lose your first 50 games quickly."*

This is how you learn at first. You might not need 50 games for an average Euro, but play fast and loose for several games until you get the hang of it. Then feel free to sit there and grid out an optimal strategy if you want to.
>'Eurogames' being tedious, overwhelming, and slow

Funny, that's exactly how I feel about many Ameritrash games.

"My turn?"  "Nope, we need to flip these 4 cards, resolve them in order using these special dice, then move the 34 monster pieces spaces equal to the number of Night tokens that are pulled out of the Gloom jar."  "Okay, now can I go?"  "Nope, we have to resolve the third quadrant of the board because John stepped into it last turn.  If the Glormax is in the forbidden zone, then we need to flip over these hostility cards to make sure that we are allowed to summon the holy soldier in zone 6."  "Now can I go?"  "Sure!  Your Turn!"  "I move into this space." "Nothing happens... Awesome, then we move the Nothingness counter forward 4 times and release the foolhounds which deal you 14 damage.  Do you respond?"  "I have a handgun that deals..." "Great roll these 3 dice and see if the Houndmaster doesn't appeal to the Deathjudge for a restraining order..."
The problem I see in this, especially in euros where players are dealing with numbers and other somewhat calculable(is this even a word) elements is that everyone in the table must subscribe to the same idea in order for it to work. If Jerry from accounting takes 10 mins thinking over his move, I sure as hell wouldn't play from the gut because chances are good that he would win simply by thinking through his moves better. 
I don't dislike euro board games, but *god damn if I don't hate playing euro board games*.  You've had four other players turns to figure out what you're going to do.  Very rarely does the board state change so much that you need more time than everyone else combined to figure out your turn.  I'm not playing playing because I want an intense contest of wit and strategy.  Some people want that, and *that's fine*.  People can enjoy different things.

But I'll let you know upfront that I am happy to skip a game and just watch how it plays out because either the game encourages AP or the players themselves tend towards AP.  That shit is *exhausting*.
Six sided turn timer is the best board game investment. Makes for a little less screaming of "just go!" 
I played with one guy who would even say things along the lines of "hold on, I have to reevaluate the *whole board state* again" right before his turn because another player changed the state of the game a bit much for him. Hated playing with him but never said it.
I have given the following advice for Five Tribes: "Don't sink time into looking for the perfect move. Look for a good move, then do that." It is unfortunate that Five Tribes rewards the player for taking long turns, and the design itself is partially to blame, but that doesn't excuse a slow player for being inconsiderate of everyone else's time.

Also, I'm sorry your introduction to Fresco went badly, OP. Under better circumstances, it really is a lovely game.
I find that board games, in general, are a lot more enjoyable if you don't care whether you win or lose. Just try to enjoy the process of playing from turn to turn. If you win, it's a nice bonus, but it shouldn't be essential to your experience of the game.
It's crazy how long the modern version of the board gaming hobby has existed without game clocks becoming normal. "Lifestyle game" players don't use them only for tournaments, we use them all the time to keep the game going, even playing in a bar, on a plane, or whatever. It doesn't prevent socializing, either.
I play euros pretty much exclusively, and I don't get your point at all
I heard once, possibly from a Tim Ferriss podcast, that decision making is a skill, and the only way to get better at it is to practice it. By agonizing and being hesitant to make a decision, you're not getting any better. Effective decision making is made quickly, with the information available to you at that time. There is no perfect decision. 

As General Patton said:
> ["A good solution applied with vigor now is better than a perfect solution applied ten minutes later."](http://www.generalpatton.com/quotes/)

These two philosophies that I try to carry into game play with me. I try to make decisions before my turn rolls around, with contingencies for what I'll do if my first option becomes unavailable. This means when it is my turn I can usually execute quite quickly. 

Do I usually win? No. 
Do I often realise, just after I take my turn, that I made a suboptimal move? Yep. 
Do I sometimes take longer to make decisions? Yep, though it's the exception rather than the rule. 
Do I enjoy most game experiences? Yep.

I always say : " Don't try too hard to win your first games. You will just lose after a longer time that it should. Nothing make sense for now. Try it, learn it, enjoy it."

From another thread: 
>Don't be "I'm confused" but more, "I know there are things I can't possibly understand about what I'm about to do but I'll do it anyway"
If this is a problem then start a timer on your phone. I had an issue with someone taking very long turns (3-5 minutes) so after a while, when they started umming and ahhing, I turned the timer on and said, "you have one minute, fucking buy something." The turns became a lot quicker after that.
Or I can play a game that doesn't force me into making rushed, suboptimal decisions.
If you don't try to optimize your moves and actions you shouldn't play euro games. 
That is what these games are all about: you getting the best result with the resources and situations you face when it is your turn by doing the best possible moves. Players shouldn't take several minutes on every turn, but sometimes it is needed (especially in the end phase).

Went backwards this month, but not as bad as it could have been.  I had several outstanding orders with pre-orders attached, and most of them arrived this month.  On top of that, my FLGS had a B2G1 sale on Black Friday so I naturally had to check it out, and ended up walking out with Vinhos, Great Western Trail, and Colony.

**Note:** This is might be the last month I keep track of unplayed expansions.  I've started using the BG Stats app to log my plays, and it doesn't appear to have expansion support. Additionally, with things like the MoM2e expansions or the Imperial Assault Ally/Villain packs or the extra Viticulture visitors, it's tough to accurately log what was used without taking time to track down which expansion things come from ... and between playing games and trying to get through my stack of primed-but-unpainted miniatures, ain't nobody got time for that!

Discussion:  
Early in the month, I went to a local con and got to play a number of new games, but none that I owned.  With Thanksgiving, our monthly gaming group didn't meet, so I wasn't able to get anything new to the table.  On the upside, over the Christmas break, we're already planning one all day game day and I should be able to get some games in with family as well.
A game about pizza!? Oh good lord, that's super tempting.
I agree! I would find this quite helpful.

As people have mentioned, I know that play times vary widely based on the group, but hey, so do our ratings of a game! And I still find that 1-10 rating # on BGG useful. One doesn't take it as gospel -- just as a general average, one factor you can take into consideration among many others.

What I find *really* helpful is specific comments about play time, like whether turns are likely to provoke AP, or if it's one of those games where you add +30m per player, or if the play time is much shorter when you play it solo. The kind of thing that I usually have to comb reviews for. I'm not sure how this kind of information could be represented in a single number on BGG, really, but I'm just indulging in some wishful thinking here.
The ideal thing would be to have some sort of  calculated personal playtime for every game. 

A ratio thing where you put your group's playtime for every game and based on that it will use user data/ compare similarly timed users. 
You want to know how long the playtime is for Caverna.
So if you take 2 hours to play agricola, it looks at Sam who has played agricola with a 2 hour playtime as well and then sees Sam took 3 hours to play Caverna. Using this info it will dynamically display a 3 hour playtime for you.
Of course it wouldn't use just one user's data but multiple users with similar playtimes for games and average it out. 
I'd like a feature that tells you how player count affects play time. Carcassonne is a flat 60 minutes regardless of player count, Cyclades is 40 min + 10 per player, and Power Grid is a proportional 30 min per player, but the listed play times don't tell me the difference.
I don't know why everyone here is so focused on variation. 

Everything in the voteable things are varied, the idea is that over several hundred votes the average will give you some kind of indication. 

The box time is public information, where's the harm in just including a user vote as well? It's just a bit of extra information, use it don't use it. I still think it'd be useful to know that, on average, people rate a game as taking two hours instead of one hour. 

Sure there's variables, but when that comes out as the average it means it's probably going to take a little longer than you may expect. 
I log my plays and their durations on BGG. That info has to be somewhere.

Basically, I'm saying that *I'm* doing *my* part. All yall need to hold up your end.  ;-)
It would be even better not to compute just the average_time, but average_time +/- std_dev.
It would be horrible. It would be skewed by the people who play games and chat at the same time or do it while watching tv or those who are either just really really fast or who put low times in because they think it is some reflection of intelligence or skill. Better just to take the box for what it is worth. 
Because the times are still going to be skewed.  If a box says 120-180 minutes, then you're going to get some people able to play the game in 100 minutes, and it may take some people 220 minutes.  Either way, you're still going to have a wide range for the time frame depending on the group.  
  
What if you only have extremely fast, skilled players reporting that the average time a game takes is 1.5 hours, even though the box says 2-3, but it turns out that your group takes 3 hours to play the game because you aren't as good as the skilled players who are reporting the shorter time.  The estimate wouldn't have helped you, at all.  
  
What's wrong with the time estimates given on the boxes?
No joke, my friends played a 5 hour game of Imperial Setters because no one read the rules and everyone was on their phones. Sounded like a terrible time...
because almost every group plays at difference speeds based on numerous factors(experience, individual AP, socialising, distractions, etc).
How do they get their play times? 

I know that when you're logging a game you can put in your play time and I just assumed that those stats came from the average that people log for their games.
I think it would be a good idea to have it. The page could show the publisher's estimate / suggested playing time and the results of voting similar to how they're already showing the player counts (*supports* and *works best with*).

I think many publisher's are intentionally putting too optimistic estimates on heavier games as many players would feel 5+ hours playing time off-putting. Many disappointments could be avoided if there would be more realistic estimates available. At least I have bought a couple of games where the suggested playing time was already on the longer side and the real playing time was even longer (Fury of Dracula for example). Those games rarely get played so I probably would've not bought them in the first place had I know the real playing time.

Telling me we're doing something wrong or we should talk less is not the solution. For me, having a good time with my friends is as important as playing the actual game and if the game is built around negotiation, story, discussion or anything that encourages talking, it should be counted in the estimate. Only way we can complete Eldritch Horror in the suggested playing time is by not reading the encounter texts and simply rolling the dice and seeing the results.
I've discovered that my group tends to play games faster since I was shocked that most people are not playing 3-4 player games of Catan in 20-35 minutes normally.  And that includes chatting about life during the game.
I've found that if you have a group where everyone has played the game multiple time, analysis paralysis is avoided, and there aren't distraction, you can come close to the box playtime, even on monster games. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case.  
I usually double the box time.  At the end of the game, I look at my friends with disbelief and say 'this is supposed to take 45 MINUTES'.
Awesome question.

Especially doesn't make sense when "best at" player count exists.
I don't think it'd be any more accurate really, with how varied things are depending entirely on your group. And after the first few playthoughs, I find box times to be either accurate or exaggerated.

Would you put your brain into a robot body?
Check out Mechs vs Minions
Really makes this game sound fun; great review. I'd love to play it soon, but I'm not sure I'm going to rush out to grab it. Techno Bowl also has the risk of failure on every action though it uses a slightly different roll mechanic (it's Powered by the Apocalypse essentially, for any RPG players out there). I would love to compare the two and see how they stack up. 
Whole lotta time just describing what miniatures are, what the box smells like, what assembling miniatures involves.
So this is off the cuff, but from a writing stand point I think you may be dedicating a bit too much attention to the corporation based on the description of the game you've given us.

The goal of the game is to escape the cave, so that should be your driving narrative. Your corporation (at least as far as you've revealed) is ultimately irrelevant, it could be anybody. In fact, simply having the corporation be nameless/faceless is probably the best way to go about it. You want to humanize your characters (players) and casting your corporation as an uncaring, non-entity may be the best way to achieve a sense of fear/dread as you're essentially emphasizing that your "employer" isn't concerned with your well-being. 

One way to go about this would be to mirror what they do on r/scp, shoot for that cold, detached, scientific-esque approach that the SCPs use when describing their employees. 
The flashlight battery thing is a tired trope. In real life, a good flashlight goes on for days, and you can take extra batteries. Maybe make something else the cause of the time limit, like food or oxygen or something.
>The difficulty is how to design the 'corporation' so that it's not just a rehash of Weyland-Yutani or any of the other tropes around,

Make them intelligent. To wit:

>have to escape before their flashlights run out of battery

Professionals cost more money than batteries. Corporations doing the whole "MWAHAHAHAHA." thing in fiction are *less* evil than corporations that exist today, which ruthlessly use expertise to exploit people and systems to their fullest, never take responsibility for their actions, and make money at the cost of anyone but themselves.
Well this may totally not be what you're looking for but to reference and not directly revealing who they are remind me of the TV series of Mr. Robot. Where the main character talks about his firm as "Evil Corp" literaly where in fact they are name of the company is "E-Corp". You could use an alias or a "daughter company name" and reveal the Main company at a later time? 

You could also create a universe with mulitple big corporations (Netrunner like) and use daughter companies to act under their behalf without reveal who they work for.
As others have said, the flashlight thing is a little weak. Do some research and find out what kinds of dangers actually exist in caves. At some point in the game, while they're exploring, some event triggers one or more of these things. 

If they're professionals exploring an uncharted area, they'll have some detection equipment, some of which will be used to detect noxious gases that like to gather in caves. They would probably have oxygen in case they find some of those gases.



Make something like that your limiter. If they run out of oxygen, they have some amount of time to get out before the gases kill them. Prolonged exposure should have some negative effect.

Your corporation isn't that important and doesn't need fleshed out too far in order to make the plot engaging. Most likely, the explorers will find something they're probably not supposed to find. Maybe whatever it is belongs to another corporation, it's alien, it's magic, it's not supposed to exist, whatever. 

Ultimately, it doesn't really affect the gameplay since the corporation isn't actually playing. Unless you want to have it be a Dead of Winter or Betrayal At House on the Hill where one of the players is an agent of the company. Even then, the flavor isn't really that important. Company wants something, explorers find something they didn't expect, they don't know who's actually in charge, that's pretty much all that's needed.
**Trains** is a lot of fun. You're building a deck as well as a train network on the board. 
While I haven't played it, I would suggest that Clank! is what you are looking for.

Reviews have been solid for it and the theme is super cool, you play as thieves trying to steal treasure from a dragon's lair, it has a dungeon crawling vibe with push your luck and deck building mechanics.
* Concordia
* Lewis & Clark
You could take a look at **Aeon's End** if you like co-op games.
I have not a fan of pure deck builders as I find the mechanic alone is not enough for me...With that in mind though games with deck\bag building woven in with other great mechanics include:

**Great Western Trail**

**Rococo**

**Mombasa**

**Orleans**
**For the Crown** is deckbuilding with Chess. **Salmon Run** is a light deckbuilding and racing game. You should also look at **Battalia: the Creation**.
Have you played any of Martin Wallace's deck building games? It sounds like you could really be into 'a few acres of snow' or 'a study in emerald'!
Haven't played through a full game yet, but Vikings Gone Wild is really cool. You can play on Tabletopia, and the Kickstarter starts shipping next year (Spring, I think). 

It's a worker placement/resource management game with a deck building mechanic at its core. I hope it makes a splash when it hits next year. 
**Clank!** seems like is something you are looking for. It's a deck building game that resolves around the idea of exploring a cave map using the deck you build. Avoid trap, break into room, get that loot and getting out before the dragon wakes up and eat you alive! The only down side is that the combat part might be a little weak since it's not the main focus of the game, but otherwise it seems like it's something you'll definitely be interested in!
Yo Dawg, I heard you like deck building so I put some deck building in your deck building game.

**Deck Building: the Deck Building Game**
If you want hardcore clue, try alchemists.

Its like youre playing 2 medium weight games at the same time, one of them being clue 2.0
Lady Alice or mystery of the abbey. 

Mysterium isn't really like clue; there is no deduction,  and it's cooperative
[Mystery of the Abbey](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/915/mystery-abbey) is the most popular choice for a 'modern Clue'. It gets rid of the roll-and-move, adds a little bit of variable powers via cards and speeds itself up . There's also [Mystery Express](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65907/mystery-express) as another deduction game in the same sort of game line although it's quite a bit rarer than Abbey making it $80-100 for a copy.
221B Baker Street is pretty close. You travel around the board piecing together clues to solve a murder. 
**Perfect Alibi** and **Sleuth** are both logic puzzles like Clue but harder.  Perfect Alibi also introduces some player powers that can be changed around in the course of the game.

IMO, **Mysterium** and **Kill Doctor Lucky** would only be similar to Clue if you're looking at the theme, not the mechanics.
Kill Doctor Lucky is kind of like the inverse of Clue.

You are the murderer, you must collect weapons and sneak up on Doctor Lucky, and when nobody else can see you, you must kill him.

It's like the thirty minutes immediately before Clue.
If you really want to solve a murder (or the closest thing) try Sherlock Holmes: Consulting detective
I recently played a game called "Kill Doctor Lucky".  It is a reverse clue where you have to kill Doctor Lucky in a secluded room with whatever weapons you get.  I really enjoyed it and it definitely reminded me of Clue.
Mystery of the Abbey is my favorite game in this category.
One of Target's new exclusive games is called Suspicion. You can get it really cheap, and it's quite fun
**Clue: The Great Museum Caper**

/u/r2d8 getinfo
**Mysterium** is like Clue with dreams.
Cluedo
Cluedo
There are great iOS/Android apps for **Carcassonne** and **Patchwork**. 

**Hive Pocket** is very portable and could be played on an airplane tray table. I haven't tried it, but in the SUSD review of **Arboretum**, they mention playing that on a plane (you just need to scrunch the cards together a bit to only show suit and number).
Travel **Settlers**

**Carcassonne** or **Le Havre** on a tablet

(also **Puerto Rico** or **Ra** but I find the computer players very weak)

**M:tG** _just_ fits on normal 'plane tables

**Epic**, sadly doesn't, although that's a much better game for two


I've had quite a lot of success with Fungi (also known as Morels). Short but tense games with very easy and compact setup
Hive Pocket and Star Realms are our train/plane games of choice

**Biblios**. I think it really works the best at 2.
I would go with an App for **Splendor** or **Ticket to Ride**, but if you are set on a physical game then **Hive Pocket**, **Hanabi**, or a plain deck of cards are probably your best bets.
It's old school, but nothing beats the old school games for travel versions. Tiny, magnetic and super cheap. My dad and I also used to play a lot of cribbage on planes.
* **Love Letter**
* **Coup**
The **Neuroshima Hex!** app. It's got everything the base game has, but removes the finicky part of having to resolve combat yourself. 

Base game comes with 4 armies, with the option to buy more. 
If you are on budget, what I just bought is a simple "Polarvide" blanket from Ikea and stretched it over a table. Didn´t have the chance to actually play anything on it but I tested cards picking and dice rolling and works pretty well for something that costs 3,50€
In every thread that shows how to make or where to buy some cool accessory, someone always comes in and talks about how it's such a waste of money and how *they* could do it for way cheaper. I've got big news: it's not a waste of money for everyone.

A nice quality table covering (not a table cloth or some DIY project) is exactly what I've been needing, and $55 is no big deal for such a product. I wonder if they'd be able to custom cut it, so I just sent them an email.

Thanks very much for sharing!
I purchased a 4.0 mm nylon/mesh neoprene sheet from hookloopoutlet.com last year. Very satisfied. In fact I just upgraded the size of my dining/gaming table, so I will be sending business their way again for another one. 
$54?  Hell, I went to my local fabric store, bought a few yards of felt for around $3 per yard, and made a table cover that would fit snug over the table.  Now I've got a surface that lets pieces slide smoothly, and allows for picking up cards, and sliding them under others without needing to pick them up.  All for less than $10.
You can buy Speed Felt fabric to make your own. Super durable, quality look, and designed for cards to smoothly slide over.  Bonus of any color you want.



Speed felt is what real poker table use. Rather than that fluffy felt from Walmart that looks bad & gets fur balls.


I made a table cover from a layer of felt over a layer of car headliner material.  The felt is a nice surface to play on, the headliner gives it a little bounce.  Headliner is expensive, but the fabric store we go to frequently has coupons for 60% off one item.  I can't remember how much I paid for the whole thing, but it wasn't too bad.  I just used spray adhesive to glue them together.

The felt is starting to pill after a year or so - I may have to think about replacing it with a neoprene mat.
I picked up a couple of [Quiver Gaming Mats](http://quivergaming.com) when they did their first kickstarter a couple years ago. We love them!
Dirt cheap table cloth is what I went with. Checks all the boxes.
I bought a 5 dollar black nylon tablecloth from Amazon.  Works great.
I got myself the Ultimate Guard 90 play mat, best decision ever. I even take it to my FLGS when going to open game night.

http://www.ultimateguard.com/en/card-protection/play-mat/play-mat-space-edition-90.html
I ordered bulk mousepad material from here: http://dyetrans.com/details.php?item_no=MP001

Ended up being about $25 + $18 shipping, though I think if you ship to a business shipping might be free.  I got 2 yards.
Thanks for the info! 

I haven't actively tried looking for a new table cover, but what I've stumbled upon is always $100+ and doesn't fit my awkward sized table.

We currently have a small blanket covering it, stretched out and stapled underneath, and while good for cards absolutely sucks for rolling dice! Hopefully I can show this to the wife and convince her we need this.
I've got a Poker Hoody from http://pokerhoody.com/ which is really nice. I got a cosmetically impaired one for cheaper and have been very happy with it.
What game is on the mat?
I think I've seen your review on this before and it's convinced me. I've added this to my Christmas list. Thanks! 
Does anyone have experience with mats that are only 1.5mm instead the 3mm?
How durable are these? I have a cat and can't(/won't) keep her off the table when we're not playing games. 
Perhaps I missed it, but did you mention which online store you purchased from? Even though it looked sketchy, it seemed to work out well for you, and I'd be interested to check it out myself.
I use a gaming mat from frontline gaming. Works great for miniatures or board games. Heavy enough that it lays flat even after storing rolled up for quite some time.
I live in an apartment and space is tight. Hence, we play on this common white folding picnic table (about 72' x 30').

I'd want something to cover this thing up when we game. What solution would you guys suggest? 
This is great. Do you have any regret getting the 5mm instead of 3mm thickness? Without having felt it, I would think thicker is better. *Edit: nevermind, I just saw the Youtube reviewer was not you. But you think 3mm is just fine then?
Unfortunately most of the ones sold by the place you mentioned in the video only come in black. I'd really love a different color top (specifically charcoal/dark gray). Haven't found another place that sells that option for a reasonable price just yet...
I purchased 2 cheap yoga mats, the thinnest ones. They have a cushy texture, awesome for rolling dice on, hextiles don't slip on them. It's been a really awesome solution!
I got in on this Kickstarter for the second gen of their gaming mat. It seems like it will be wonderful, though I won't be getting it still for a few months. I'm hoping they sell this version in retail, because there is a serious lack of good gaming surfaces around.

I ordered from Gamematz on Friday with their sales. 

http://www.gamematz.com/blue-geometric-theme-gaming-mat/

I know it's expensive, but I don't consider myself a budget gamer and I wanted a nice looking topper. 

I also got the Kraken version. 

My friend who has a glass table went out and got cheap felt and glued a rubber back. It works good and it was cheap. But the edges constantly curl and it just doesn't look that good. Hopefully they're as premium as advertised. I'm so sick of playing on my wood table. 
Felt has worked great for me.

* super cheap: costs me $13 CAD for a 2m x 1m (3ft x 6ft) rectangle
* comes in a variety of colors
* easy to clean, durable
* light, portable, folds up easily
No love in this thread for velvet?

Instead of felt, we went to a cloth store and purchased a large piece of velvet. I think we paid 15 € for it? For (I'm estimating) just under 6 square meters worth of fabric. 

Wide selection of colors, easy to pick up cards, dice don't roll to infinity any more and you can just chuck it in the laundry too...
I made my own awhile back. I think it looks nice, but the downsides are that it's heavy so I sometimes forget to get it out when we have game nights and it's a little difficult to clean.  Other than that, it works great.  I think I'd rather have something like what you're explaining that could be rolled up and put away much easier and is easier to clean.  I can't see the youtube video (I'm at work), is it just a custom-sized piece of foam or something?

[Gaming Felt Tabletop Cover (w/o leaf)](http://i.imgur.com/Vu9jTw1.jpg)
To be honest, $54 seems steep for a plain black matte table cover. The only reason I say this is these mats are quite common in Warhammer and Warmachine games, and  6' x 4' mat with a detailed background printing runs about $60-$100.

I have Teen Titans deck builder and I love it because of the theme. I just recently bought mage knight and love it even more. the use of miniatures really complement the deck building aspect of the game. 

I don't regret my purchases and I'm really looking forward to adding legendary to my collection, but my advice for you is to save for Legendary unless you have a love for the DC theme. 
They have a system called the cerberus engine where they then retheme the game to others like Street Fighter and such.

It's a much simpler deck building game compared to Legendary, I love Legendary especially with the Dark City Expansion. The game is great and thematic and I had hours of fun.

With DC deck building though, it's not so thematic, it's just a engine that paste the DC theme on, at least in my opinion, if you like Legendary, you'll probably find DC's one too simple for what it is.

If you can try once then by all means at least play once, but if you ask me straight up, just forget it.

Here's the thing, I like Marvel Legendary more than DC Deck Builder, but I get waaaaaaaay more games of DC played.  A few things to note:

1.  Like you said, it's cheaper.  If you keep an eye out, you can get it for 20-30.

2.  Set up and tear down is much MUCH faster.  5-10 minutes and you are ready to go.

3.  It scales well regardless of player count.  Marvel is to easy for 2, good at 3, sometimes difficult at 4, and very hard at 5.  You can houserule to mitigate. but still.  And of course, if you do random setup you can end up losing quickly, which is especially brutal given the setup time.

4. Given that you have your own heroes, and the fact that they have a co-op version now, there is a lot of variety to be had.

I hope you get Legendary eventually, but there is a lot of fun to be had with DC Deck Builder.
Legendary is definitely the better game, but set up and takedown is horrifyingly annoying. DC got old quick for me. The best deck building game is Ascension imo.
I really enjoy deck builders, but DC Deckbuilder is by far my least favorite of that type I have played.

**Why I don't like it:** The game is over simplified, with the theme stripped out from it. Yeah you have the picture of the characters in the cards, but then you have Batman using heat vision and recruiting villains, all in order to create a very dull deck builder. I like to have a little something more in my deck builders, that's why I'd recommend Marvel Legendary over it, since it feels like you are fighting the villains on the streets along with the characters feeling like they should feel. But at the end of the day I just find DC's mechanics lacking.

**Why you might want to get it:** Now that the small rant is over, DC Deckbuilder is good if you're playing group doesn't like games with a lot of rules in it. Legendary is simple once you get the hang of it, but then sometimes you dread playing it just because you have to set it up, especially if you have expansions. While DC is a quick setup, play, and rules explanation. It's what I'd consider an introductory game to deckbuilding.

We like playing Carcassone, Patchwork, Paperback, Ticket to Ride, Splendor and Lords of Waterdeep. 
So hard to get him off the computer but generally jaipur or Carcassonne
Carcassone, Splendor and Run, Fight or Die... I'm working on it.
Mostly Eldritch Horror
Just finished Mech vs Minions with my SO last week. We're about to start Arcadia Quest campaign this weekend. 
So far I've gotten her to play and she has enjoyed **Boss Monster**, **Biblios**, and **Forbidden Desert**. Now we have **Pandemic Legacy**, don't know if she will actually like it, but she promised to play the whole season with me.
Mine will TRY almost anything, but she really prefers Euros and she seems to like co-ops quite a bit ... except for Pandemic. She doesn't like Pandemic.

I believe her current favorites are Food Chain Magnate and Grand Austria Hotel, but I'm guessing that's because she hasn't had the time to sit down and learn A Feast for Odin. She's going to love it.


Right now she's on an **Istanbul** kick, but she also likes so many other games we can pretty much play a different game or two every evening
We play Patchwork, Star Realms, Tiny Epic Galaxies, Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu, Hive Pocket, Game of Trains, The Grizzled...
Seasons, arkham horror, mansions of madness, quarriors...anything really. Although she prefers thematic and coop games over Euro/competitive. Seasons gets a pass due to the awesome art :)
We like 7 wonders Duel, Agricola: ACBaS, Pandemic, and Evolution. 
**Patchwork**

**Cottage Garden**

**Agricola**

**7 Wonders: Duel**

**Ticket to Ride**

**Biblios**
Arkham Horror, mostly. He doesn't really like anything else - though there is the occasional Castles of Burgundy and we have read through a couple of the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective series. 
Lately we've been on a card game kick, so 6 nimmt!, Jaipur, Schotten-Totten, and Arboretum.
She mostly only wants to play **Carcassonne**.... Sometimes **Jaipur**. She hated **7 Wonders: Duel** because of the economy (stuff costing more because someone else produces it)...
Our most played games as a couple are **Legendary: Marvel**, **Shadowrun: Crossfire**, **Forbidden Desert**, **Lost Cities**, and **7 Wonders: Duel** has been a recent addition.

I bought it. I have been playing the crap out of it but my situations have lent it to be extremely desired in my circles.

Its Magic the Gathering for boardgamers. 

The game comes with 300 cards, each one unique. The cards are dual sided, one evil side and one good side. In the game, the cards are your monsters (called warriors), your lands (called Resources) and your spells (called orders). You get 30 cards to a deck. The way most of the resources work is by phasing them, aka flipping them over to their other side. You can do this infinitely, but eventually you will want to cast something that will Lock them (cannot phase) until your next turn. 

Combat is all around attacking a central pool of points. The points are half good points and half evil. Successfully hitting this pool gets you points of the type that you attack with. When one type is completely drained from the pool, the game ends. The player with the most OF 1 TYPE, GOOD OR EVIL, wins. The catch is that you can only block attacks with the opposing faction, good or evil.

It is very combo heavy with a lot of interrupts and spell casting. You are never restricted in options, just in resources. Games can last 3 turns or 30 turns, but I never feel like they last too long. Its either super close or a lucky blowout. It also plays up to 5 players simultaneously or you have enough cards to play a few games at the same time.

The place this game shines is the deck building before playing. In the manual, there is a list of all the cards combos (back and front). The faces repeat, but you might have good 1 with bad 1 on the back and also good 1 with a bad 2 on the back. Its all about trying to create combo trains to give you advantage. We spend more time building the decks than playing. Its really fun if you like trying to create crazy combos. You can also print your own combos on Drivethrucards.com And there should be expacs coming as well.

**TL;DR : I really like it. It is very cerebral. Think Magic meets The Duke. If you like Magic but don't want to buy cards forever, I recommend it. If you are trying to get a friend into magic, get it for them.**

Feel free to ask me any questions. I will respond as long as I am on tonight. I have probably 25ish hours playing and building decks.
Lots of upvotes and no responses is making it seem like many folks just gave up on Black Box.   
Hopefully someone will chime in with something.  My FLGS didn't order any copies as they got burned on last year's AEG Black Box.  They're still trying to get rid of the 2015 ones they have left.
Yeah -- I was totally on board with the Black Box that included Trains, untill I found out, it didn't contain the box [I'm a stickler for those kind of things].  (this was at a time when I didn't own Trains and it was a killer deal at 30% off even with the other throwaway games/re-themes).  I like the concept, but poor execution. 
Phase is a surprising amount of fun, considering just how many of these 'mages smashing mages' games I have.  The main magic here is that it's not a 'last guy standing wins' game.  This is VERY CEREBRAL.  

It's a think game of quick adaptation to a changing game state.  There are a million options and the nice thing about the deck building is that there is absolutely no guarantee you'll get to use that 'killer combo'.  It might get drawn into your hand, or enlisted.  At the same time, when you do get the killer combo it's DEEPLY satisfying to pull off.  

All in all...not disappointed.  I'll be buying next year's Black Box if AEG does it again.

I ordered one. We still haven't got it yet. Waiting...
I watched several of your streams, including the 2 most recent ones and I feel like there are several issues that you guys are facing with your implementation.  In streams that ask twitch to play in video games (ie. Twitch plays pokemon), its very simple for the audience to get all the information they need because the interface of the actual game is exactly the same as what is displayed for twitch through the stream, but unfortunately board games cant be displayed that way unless through a computer simulation.  It's these issues with the interface that cause me to have the most problems with the stream as it is right now.

One big issue with your stream right now is Twitch's Hand. It is something I would love to actually see but I cannot ever read what it says despite using a 4k monitor on source quality.  I've also tried on my laptop which is 1920×1080 also on source quality.  Again, I think this is super useful information but unfortunately because I cant read it, I feel like it just goes to waste.  A solution could be for you guys to consolidate your faces (including TP screen) to a smaller area or reduce the size of the twitch chat box or make the twitch chat a translucent bubble that fades away when there is no active chatting.  

Another issue is with the hand written charts that you guys use on stream, again the issue is with lack of visibility; if you were able to use some overlays that just showed the basic stats of Twitch's (and your characters, if possible). Having TP there is really useful because she can show us what she is writing on the Twitch character sheet and be our voice, but she would have a more impactful role in the viewer experience if she was simply able to update some overlay values for our character.  

I applaud you guys for your efforts and I hope that you can make use of my constructive criticism.  I love the idea of your stream and I really would like it to reach it's full potential.

If you would like to see what I mean by the overlay, you can see a fairly good version of it on the Forged By Geeks channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoaQFf0mPo
With so many viewers, how does the gameplay work exactly? 
For something that's £250 to back it's an interesting thing to do.

Does watching it on Twitch give a good idea of how the game "really" works? I hope that makes sense.
Don't forget that if you have Amazon prime, you also have twitch prime. Once a month you can "like" (or something) a channel to send them some money. I gave meant to find a channel to back and this gives me a good one to follow and see if I like it. Thanks!
You can also try the game out on Tabletop Simulator
At that point you may as well just play the absolutely amazing K:DM mod someone made for Tabletop Simulator.
Awesome! I'm busy trying to learn the game as much before I play it with friends so any help is welcome
**Battle for Germany**

**Hitler's War**

**Ogre** and **GEV**

Plus most of the Metagaming games - **Warp War** is especially fine for a small footprint game, and **Melee** and **Wizard** (and all the adventures and modules you could buy for them) are eminently replayable
**Pixel Tactics** perhaps? All the space you need is to lay out two sets of 9 cards in a 3x3 grid. Game is fun, but super swingy so it's not everyone's cup of tea.
No retreat (VPG edition)
If you're not opposed to solo-only, I HIGHLY recommend **Astra Titanus** from Victory Point Games. It's very similar to Ogre. Plus it fits in a 6"x9" poly-bag.
Advanced Squad Leader has a lot of small-footprint scenarios. 
I love some games I'm horrible at. It doesn't make them less fun.
I suck at most games TBH. 
I'm not that good, myself. I even tend to lose games I've played multiple times against people unfamiliar with the game. Splendor? Forget it. Stone Age? I'm lucky if I've won 10% of the games I've played. Castles of Burgundy? Nope. Although I probably don't lose as often as I think I do. But it certainly feels like it.

I have noticed two things that have made me think about the way I approach games:

1. In the games I've played where I play more viscerally I tend to do much better and even win. I can't be sure, but sometimes I think I spend too much time thinking I'm being clever rather than just choosing the best option that my instinct is telling me to choose.

2. There are some euro games that I do much better with than others. Firenze, for example, is one I tend to do very well in. While I haven't been able to fully put my finger on why certain games are better "fits" for me, there must be certain mechanisms that my brain just finds easier to grasp.

My points are:

1. Don't be discouraged just because you tend to lose. Games are as much about the experience as they are about the score. It's definitely frustrating to lose all the time. But I also play games for other reasons. Just keep chanting "WWWWD" as you are playing ("what would Will Wheaton do?").

2. Don't be so quick to assume you always lose. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. I recommend tracking your games, if you don't already and reviewing how you are actually doing compared to how you think you are doing. You may be surprised.

3. Consider the games at which you lose frequently versus those at which you lose less often or even frequently win. See if you can identify a trend in mechanisms or style and see if you can explore that with other games.

4. Strategy guides are useful. But nothing beats watching your opponents and speaking with them afterwards about *their* strategy. I find that blanket strategy guides are not that effective when applying them against opponent(s) that has/have developed group-think about the game.  So watch what they do and talk about their approach afterward. Consider whether you want to try out the same strategy (and probably force them to adapt) or block their strategy (forcing them to adapt). One of the few games of Stone Age I have won I spent most of it using an aggressive denial strategy in a 2-player game against someone whose strategy I knew.
Euro games is a very broad category. I love Castles of Burgundy and Targi but based on the videos I've seen, I would NOT like Power Grid. (Puerto Rico I have but haven't played yet.)

Power Grid and Puerto Rico are both economic games, so maybe you should try some euro games that don't rely so heavily on economics.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgU_E5gAMHg) is Rahdo's Top 10 list of "Thematic Euros".

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jyou6/top_ten_eurogames_by_dice_tower/) is a Dice Tower Top Ten Euro game list. Since they're not HUGE euro-gamers, some of these might better fit your play preferences.\

Have fun!



i can't ever seem to win puerto rico. i have something like 50 plays and i get the game pretty well. and every time i do an action, i'm confident it's a good decision and not helping my opponents but man it just seems almost every time i get burned. that game is tough but i love it.
I read this in some other thread the other day, and I think it is *the* best quote with the key to a good gamenight.

>'When playing a game, the goal is to win, but it is the goal that is important, not the winning'  *~ Reiner Knizia, (probably around 1603, the founding year of the Shogunate.*

This describes exactly why I do like eurogames, despite not being a very regular winner (putting it lightly). I have some friends who can win more consistently in Terra Mystica or Tzolk'in than I can, but man is *trying* to beat them fun. It is that challenge I enjoy, and I can't imagine always winning making it better. The trying to win, that's the real drug. :P
I've never played Power Grid but Puerto Rico is a great engine builder action selection game. Do you understand the concepts behind engine building games? Do you recognize what your priorities should be at different stages of the game? How to build an efficient engine, get the big buildings and make them get points for you? Are you trying to do everything? Because you probably shouldn't be. Do you try to keep your strategy in focus and do things that further your strategy rather than just do things to do them? These games are all about efficiency. Doing more with less. That should always be in your mind.
I love Euro games but I never seem to win. Games like Agricola appeal to me, but I always get crushed in game.

So for me I just try to enjoy the game, with winning as my secondary objective.
Euro games are all about economic efficiency. Seeing the path and trying to be as optimal as possible. Power Grid is more of a finance game which I also suck at. But games like Puerto Rico are just economical (engine building). Making goods and shipping/selling them in the most efficient way as possible. You probably just can't find the good paths to take and which actions will accelerate your engine. Personally, I can't see the steps in finance heavy games.
The first big step to developing your play ability in any game is to download the rules and understand them well enough to be able to correctly teach a brand new player. 

Being able to visualize the entire game is a huge advantage. 
If you ever grow tired of power grid I've got lots I'm willing to trade for it ;) 
There's a difference in strategy between Euros like **Puerto Rico** and **Hansa Teutonica** and Euros like **Glass Road** and **Castles of Burgundy.**

HT and PR both reward replaying them over and over and figuring out the optimal/most efficient moves.  The initial boardstate is exactly the same each time, and the only differences are starting order and what other players do.  It gives you the ability if you are focused to know the optimal move if you play the game a lot, almost making the game like chess.  Someone's starting play can give you an opportunity or throw you for a loop if they start out with a unique play.  If you play this type of game against someone with a lot of experience playing it, you may need to get stomped dozens of times before you can crack how to beat them.

GR and CoB both have some randomness but mostly based on the order that tiles come out - knowing that not every tile will come out during a particular game.  I'm not a min-maxer who can quickly calculate in my head the perfect first four moves and memorize them, I'm much better at looking at my current options, and assessing what I think the best strategy is in my current situation.  Games like Castles of Burgundy overwhelm you with options - an animal strategy may cause you to win one game and lose another.  You can't play Glass Road assuming that you will get the exact same perfect combination of three tiles every game and a tile that is game changing in one game may be worthless in another.  These games are best played by being able to look at board state and choose a strategy that works for you in that particular game.

Something like **Stone Age** falls in the middle.  There is an element of the first category where for the first few moves you know that you need to prioritize getting tools/agriculture/additional meeples and generally there's not necessarily a huge change in strategy between which huts/cards come out.  However, it does have that aspect where if you manage to pull cards that give you a 7x multiplier per meeple, you probably want to unlock as many meeples as possible.  

Knowing the difference in types of Euros is something that I like to mentally keep track of as it's a way of keeping yourself focused in game since basically every eurogame punishes people who are less efficient and one of the fastest ways to be inefficient is to be uncertain which strategy to follow.
I win infrequently. I think it's because I tend to do my turns very fast. I like to take as little time on my turn as possible to keep things moving. I just play from my gut and have a discovery or 'see what happens' kind of mentality.
Me, but I enjoy sucking at them!
It's a matter a question you need to ask yourself: "Do you still enjoy your time in the game even when you lose?". If yes, then I don't think there is a problem. You probably will win sooner or later and the victory will be even sweeter.

For example, I'm pretty good in "dudes on a map" war/strategy games. I win them quite often. But for some reason I can't seem to win in **Blood Rage**. And it's my copy of the game too! Apparently I'm quite bad with drafting games :P (I completely suck at 7 Wonders too). It's not like I get pummepeld but I'm always like 2nd or not-too-far 3rd etc. Thing is, I enjoy playing BR so much that I simply don't care. That's how much I like the game.
I suck at all games.
"But I often question now why I play them at all."

If you don't want to, then don't feel like you "should" play games like that.  There's a fair amount of Euro-snobbery that creeps up (at least online), but don't listen to it.  Everybody just play whatever games they prefer and leave the others alone.  Trust me, none of us are cooler than the other for which board games we play...

I'm terrible at most board games I play, but I still dig playing them, so I continue.  If you find that you don't enjoy games that you're bad at, then remove those from your rotation.

But yeah, to answer your question: I ab-so-lute-ly suck at Euro games.
No, but I'm kinda bad at most every game.
You don't need to like them. In fact you've described why they're not always a good pick for more 'social' games
I've always liked them and still do. One of my favorite things about games, and competition in general, is that you get to be nasty to people in a socially acceptable way. 

Now, I don't mean legitimately nasty in a distasteful or annoying way, but rather that you can drop all the baggage and pretense that, in our daily lives, is always hovering around our interactions. You can act in a purely selfish way and are rewarded for it. The stakes are just high enough to be meaningful but not high enough to cause harm (at least they shouldn't be).

I suspect it is a personality thing though. You may warm up to the feeling of being a lying son-of-a-bitch over time, but if it's not something for which you have a natural inclination, I'm not sure that you will ever be fully comfortable.
I think the most important thing to remember is that even if people can completely read your face, you can still contribute and do well in these games. They will be so confident they can read anything you do, that you can lure them into a wrong call. 
I often find negative bluffing works. If you are always nervous when lying, try to act nervous when you are speaking the truth. In Coup this will work, because you get challenged while you actually *do* have the card.
Bluffing isn't really my thing, but I always have a blast with **Sheriff of Nottingham**.  It's fun to mess with people and get in their heads.  Also, if you have a tell, just start doing that thing every time you say something to mask when you're actually lying.  You don't have to have a poker face, you just have to have consistent behavior, even if it's consistent evil grinning and 'nervous' laughing.
It's like poker, you have to know how to lie to enjoy and win. I think you could train yourself to do it well enough with practice IMHO

> **Have you learned to like bluffing games?**  
  
I have!  They allow me to scaffold newcomers into BSG / GOT territory where bluffing is the *grease* of the game, not the gears.  :)
I've played them (the best so far has been **Mafia de Cuba**) but I need them to be over in 10-15 minutes otherwise I get annoyed. I'd much rather play something else with interesting strategic choices.
I hate all bluffing games. I die first in coup. I've recently lost sheriff of Nottingham by about 130 points. I play when the group wants, and I'm a good sport about it, but I lose miserably every time. I just laugh at myself when I get caught
I don't enjoy bluffing games, by and large. There's plenty of other genres I *do* enjoy, and I focus my time on those rather than trying to teach a figurative pig to sing. You waste time, and annoy the pig.

In the few times I've been forced into playing something like **Coup**, I just tell the truth. You might be surprised how many people assume you're going to lie and screw themselves over by calling you on a card you actually have.
I feel similarly to you, and I'm totally at peace with it. I really don't enjoy these games, so I just don't play them.
Which is more absurd, your fear of all your game components being mixed together, or that there are some of us that would secretly find it fun to try to sort it all out again?
Two things: Greasy chip fingers on my cards, or someone spilling a coke or beer all over the board.
For me it's not about losing my collection, but every time I'm bringing a new game to the table I worry constantly about how it will be received. The best moment in board gaming for me is seeing the light flick on for someone who starts genuinely enjoying a game and having fun, but the worst is when people are utterly miserable with your game and you feel like you've wasted their time. I'm probably hypersensitive on this last front, but I try to go out of my way to make sure that anytime something new is about to go out, it's under the most optimal of conditions.

That said, I'm supposed to teach Concordia to 4 other people tomorrow and I'm terrified that there will be too much downtime. 
A roof leak or some similar catastrophe destroying my 18XX collection which is probably worth more than my car on the open market. I've started to move many of them into large rubbermaid totes and will probably transfer the entire collection into such containers for safer storage.
Jeff Englestein posted a story somewhere that he had a fully sorted  copy of Advanced Squad Leader with all the expansions (1000's of counters) dumped out and mixed up by his son.  20 years later and he still hasn't sorted it out yet, he just pushed the pile back into the boxes.

Anything involving liquids and cardboard.
People folding cards in half because they aren't aware that's a problem.

I've seen it happen during a game of Cosmic Encounter, and I never recovered.  The nonchalance was surreal.  Like, how do you just mindlessly fold a card in half??
My biggest fear is the regulars I play with all of a sudden want to play **Inis**, **Cry Havoc**, **Scythe**, or any other fad du jour instead or our regular scheduled programming.
That I keep buying games and my gaming group still wants to play farkle. 
My fianceé tells me that she doesn't actually like gaming and makes me choose between our collection and her. I'd obviously choose her, but this would be worst case scenario.
That my wife will find out how much I've spent on all of these games.
Someone losing exactly one small component, that just *barely* makes the game unplayable. I can get through the emotional trauma of a destroyed game, but the idea that it's only one unique irreplaceable card away from being pristine is infuriating.
I have cats, they have never touched my games on my shelves and barely bother with them when we're playing, my one cat will occasionally try to be sneaky and smack a component off the table, but the second I say her name she backs off.  My nightmare is that I come home to my games bitten and clawed up, knocked all over the floor with my cats sitting smugly staring at the destruction and chaos they've created. 

My more realistic fear is people putting my cards and components in their mouths or open mouth coughing, sneezing on them, hasn't happened yet, but I could see a few people at my local shop doing that.
1: Losing my game bag on the bus/train.  Especially when I'm packing games that are out of print.

2: All my co-players not only exhibit AP, but feel the need to orate every thought going through their head, breaking down every theoretical scenario.
If every game I play I have to roll a dice to see if what I want to happen, happens.
So me and my group play on a pool table in my apartment's basement. Every time we group up one of us plays around with the pool balls while playing. Until one of us drops one and it makes a loud crack. Whoever owns the game that is out is furious and is like "ok you're done" so far none of us have ruined any of our games but i swear one of these days we are gonna break a component yet we keep juggling them. 
I gonna go with fire! Yep that would be bad
I thought you meant a literal nightmare. :)

When I was a tournament Scrabble player, several times I had a nightmare where I would be trying to draw 7 tiles and put them face-down in front of me (the typical practice to verify a proper draw), but they would keep flipping up, and as I tried to turn them over, more would flip up, also causing more to spill out of the bag, etc. Have a field day, Freudians.
Other people's kids ingesting my components and then wanting to ask the parents to get the kid to vomit and/or search and fish for them once they hit rimside. 
Going through the effort of setting up a complex game and then having to pack it up, especially if I started explaining the rules. It has already happened to me multiple times.
Someone spilling coke on my KS edition box of The Walking Dead - All Out War would probably make me vomit from the pain.
I'll stick to things that have actually happened:

 Playing **Cosmic Encounter** with someone who was relatively new to the meetup, so I was trying to be nice and welcoming.  At the end of the game, he stuck all his ships in a tall stack between his thumb and forefinger and I asked, *"Can you please not do that?  They will explode every-"* 

Cue little ships shooting across the diner floor.  Then, he kindly blows his nose at the table and picks up every single ship and tries to help me put other stuff away, basically fingering everything he freaking could.  Apparently it didn't occur to him that someone would be bothered that he didn't wash his hands.

A week or two later, the same guy was putting his chin and mouth into a cup on the table and biting his straw without his hands and knocked a glass of ice onto my Istanbul board.  I want to be welcoming, but so help me..........

---

Next!  I was doing a first playthrough of my newly delivered kickstarter game.  We were reading the rules and one of the guys I was teaching kept making comments about how I was making his "hard" and doing a gesture like he was pleasuring himself.  Meanwhile, the other person at the table was sick and constantly blowing his nose and then touching board game pieces.  It was maybe a boon in disguise though, since it would break up the inappropriate comments from the one guy who would then yell at the other guy because everyone was going to get sick.....but that only made him feel ashamed and sad and he kept blowing his nose.


Are those scary enough?
Hm. I like my game collection, but I don't feel overly protective about it. I tend to treasure the time I spend with a game and good friends much much more than I value the simple material substance of a game. If it wears and tears, I just replace it.

If you look at it rationally, you spend - in total together - much more money if you went with your friends to the movies instead and get no material thing to keep out of it.
My idea of a nigthmare comes to my mind when I see all the pictures people post when they play board games in their groups. 80% of those photos I see glasses of beer or wine just casually standing on their tables right next to the games. I literally imagine all those glasses fall and spilling all over the games.

In our group we have a set-in-stone rule. You do not eat or drink by the game table. Period. It's fine to have a bottle of beer under the table (our tables have 2 levels) or a bag of pretzels on the side but that's as far as we get.
I opened a brand new game and one of my friends present immediately spilt some tea in the box. Immediately.

Thankfully it wasn't that bad, but, fucking really? It wasn't even open for thirty seconds!
My vision turning into a slow-motion shot where one player slowly dumps a glass of wine onto my Splotter/Eklund games, followed by a kid projectile vomiting all over my miniatures somehow melting all the paint, further tortured by a snot rocket the size of a pizza pan sloshing onto my copy of Neue Heimat, all my copies of Glory to Rome and somehow all of my games explode into flames.
Cracking a board in half. I've occasionally bent boards to coerce them into laying flat, and I've heard *just* enough horror stories that it makes me nervous every time, even when I'm the one doing the bending.
Someone spilling drinks. It happened twice on different card games. Luckily the second time they were sleeved. Now people are no longer to have drinks on the game table.

Also, teaching my friends wife new games. She huffs and puffs and acts like its the worst thing in the world. The complains the entire first game we play and usually wants to play again later. Its like pulling teeth. I wouldnt have her over if she wasnt my good friends wife
Foxing. I'm allergic to foxing on cardboard and paper. I don't lend my games to anyone for that reason, and I'm super careful about other people's games when people dump it at my place. 

Store it in a cool dry place is the motto here.
I wouldn't say that's an absurd nightmare, just a highly unlikely one, and at least one easily (though painfully) remedied should it ever come to pass.


My "absurd" nightmare is people leaving greasy finger stains all over my game components, particularly the cards. I host a lot since I have 50+ games, and noticed for the first time that one of my friends must have had some leftover grime on their hands because there was residue all over their particular color deck of cards for my new favourite game: **Concordia**.

So after spending 15 minutes delicately hand-washing the cards (they aren't fully plasticized like some other games, but at least have a wax-like surface amenable to a damp towel), I went to my local hobby shop and bought $100+ worth of sleeves and have sleeved every game in my collection where players keep cards in hand.


I won't bother for games where there is only one dealer (since it will always be ME), or if the cards are just acquired and laid out on the table, but for anything people hold, it is now protected.


I sleep better already. :)
Drinks spilled. I know it will happen someday, it has already been very close (as in: the drink was spilled but we were lucky enough that no major damage happened), but I'm the only one in my group that would rather not have them on the gaming table :|
Are you happy with your current D&D campaign?  If so, there's no reason to change it up.  Too many people fall victim to "cult of the new" where they keep chasing some high of "the next great thing!" instead of sitting down and just playing what they already have.
I was originally told at Pax East we would get them before the end of May, and that's why I paid up. Waiting a month or so isn't that bad.

It's almost December now.
Hell, I backed the Kickstarter and I'm still waiting
Have you emailed them?
I did the kickstarter and still haven't received mine. I'm a little peeved because when I contacted them about it, their response is that since I didn't confirm my shipping address in their "survey" they didn't send it. They promised I'd get it on their next wave, but I'm not happy about having to wait until after the game is available at retail to get my copy. I'm probably done with kickstarters now. 
Sounds like it will ship in November. 
Thanks for continuing to post this every month; I look forward to it every time.

-------------

#New Games:

* **Miskatonic School for Boys** -- This game is bad.  Play is too long, too easy and random, and too boring.  Would avoid like the plague.

* **Best Treehouse Ever** -- I appreciate the simplistic design, but drafting games aren't really my thing.  Luckily, it's quick so it has that going for it.

* **Small Star Empires** -- Cute little abstract.  I only played 2 players, and I think it might shine with more.  Definitely has potential.

* **Valley of the Kings: Last Rites** -- It's a deckbuilder.

* **Inis** -- Not usually one to enjoy area control games, but this was good.  The card drafting for actions made the strategy interesting, while the limited actions also worked nicely.  It felt like a fully fleshed out version of 8 Minute Empire, to me.

* **Power Grid: The Card Game** -- Do you like Power Grid, but don't want to spend 2 hours playing?  Now you can in only 30 minutes.  Immediately went to my FLGS and put this on preorder after playing.  It's everything good about the auctions in the original, but without the fiddly 3-step math calculations and network board.

* **The Golden Ages** -- This sat on my shelf for over a year unplayed.  I really appreciated the simplistic design and how that couples with changing variables/states every game.  I will definitely play this one again (hopefully tonight).

* **Terraforming Mars** -- Played this 3 times in 2 weeks.  The first time it was enjoyable.  The second time I felt like I had more control over my situation.  The third time we played with drafting, and I'm convinced that's the way the game is meant to be played.  Every game I've changed the strategy I've used, despite having the same corporation in two of the games.  I'll either tire of it in another 3 plays, or it'll be a keeper forever.
**Good now, will still be good in 12 months**

* **A Feast for Odin** - Lots of game in the box. Lots of bits in the box. I've gotten 15+ plays out of Patchwork and even though I haven't played it in a while, I'm not sick of it.  A Feast for Odin is like Patchwork and Agricola had a baby that they put on steroids and chopped into a million tiny cardboard bits. Excellent.

* **A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King** - Not a hugely complex game, but it almost becomes chess-like during play as players try to figure out not only what benefits them, but how to keep that move from benefiting their opponent(s). This has a permanent spot on my filler shelf.

* **Keyflower: The Farmers Expansion** - One of my favorite games gets animeeples. Enough said.

* **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** - I could argue with people all day long about who the werewolf is.  

* **One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak** - The new roles are a bit crazier which makes the arguments more fun.

* **Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition Expansion** - The added dice are an excellent addition to the game. The new starting tiles give RoftG enough variety at the start to stay fresh.

**Good now, will still be good in 12 months because it will be difficult to get to the table**

* **Cry Havoc** - More complex than other area control games I have, so probably won't see the table much. An expansion is already in the works and hopefully addresses some of the balance issues I've read about.

**Good now, but I just don't see it lasting**

* **Colony** - Hopefully there's expansions in the works. There's definitely some variety in the box, but I think it will need expansion(s) to stay fresh over the long term.

* **Inis** - I like it a lot right now, but for some reason I just don't see it standing up to 15-20 plays. I'm not sure what an expansion could add without changing the core gameplay, so ... this falls here for now.

* **Orleans: Invasion Expansion** - I've only played the Invasion scenario, so there are definitely other things in the box I haven't gotten to, but if they're all like the Invasion scenario, probably won't get played much after they've been beaten.

**Already done with it**

* **Specter Ops** - No reason for anyone to play this over Fury of Dracula or Letters from Whitechapel ... unless you don't have either of them.



It's a solid game, fast-playing but deep enough to play multiple times at one sitting.  It takes people a while to understand how to help themselves, hurt others, and benefit from fractional ownership - it may be simple, but it's a real train game.
Love it. My major complain about the game is the setup. You have to use the bag to pick random trains at the start, and then sort all the remaining trains. Also, it's not blindcolor friendly.

But I've played it at 3, 4, 5 and 6, always a blast. Nice depth, simple rules, almost no downtime, and you almost never know who's winning before everyone reveal their scores.
I've only played it a few times, but I find that all of the major pluses of the game (ease of rules, short play length) are undone by the fact that setting up is so long and awkward. You have to first round up all the trains together and then secretly deal out a certain amount to each player. Then you have to resort the trains into their piles and then place them on their own board, each train going on its own square. Then you have to prop up a shield to hide your trains and you then can start. If I recall correctly, your decision on your turn is to either place up to 3 trains of a single company, take 2 trains into your stash and give one back or to take 1 train into your stash. Because there are so many companies and so many train amounts and player to keep track of, it can be overwhelming to follow everything in order to play good moves.

I prefer Chicago Express as it gives you that train bidding action that's done in a much more clearer way. I find sorting to be less of an issue here because the ratio of setup time to game time is a lot less than PC even though PC is the quicker game.
With Dark City a lot of Marvel Leg's difficulty problems can be fixed, so yeah, go for it if you like the theme. Do note that the pure base set may feel a bit bland compared to Alien, there's less mechanics and lacking coordinate in the base set hurts co-op.
I have not played the Legendary Encounter games, but one thing I hear from lots of people about the two is that even though they think that Encounters is a better system, Marvel has such a great theme that they overlook it.  I really like Marvel Legendary, and if you enjoy superheroes a lot, I suggest it.  They have a giant variety of heroes and expansions.

Most here will suggest getting Dark City to up the difficulty, but I think the recent Civil War one would work as well.  Even a few of the mini expansions have tough villains.  If you end up enjoying it, odds are you will want to collect them all anyways.
Dark City is widely regarded as the essential expansion, and I'll throw Secret Wars Vol 1 into the ring as well for the addition of Sidekicks.

Regarding the semi-coop, most people just play it as co-op and maybe check on the MVP as an afterthought. The harder villains from expansions help to that end.

In my opinion, Marvel's big advantage over Alien is its endless variety. If Alien's replay value works for you, Predator might be a better buy than Marvel.
I really did not like Marvel Legendary, and was not about to drop another $30 and more to "fix" a base game that was not compelling.

I was anxious getting Legendary Aliens, in a math trade, after my Marvel experience but I am so glad I did. It is the same system but much superior.

My advice would be to try to Marvel Legendary first before buying if  you can, but frankly I would stick to the Legendary Encounters games as it is a superior system.
I think they're just vastly better cards, but a couple seem a little overpowered, especially if you can five coin a Bandit first turn. More fun than the cards they replaced though.

Has anyone bought the update for Intrigue? I'd like to hear any experiences with that, since I've yet to purchase it. 
I like what I see but havent gotten to try yet. I'm still holding out hope for another Big Box, like maybe with Adventures/Empires or something
I'm just annoyed that I bought the game a few months ago and now it's been replaced. :(
Yes they are the same size. But doesn't even matter. You can even combine Pictures with the base game despite the cards not even the same size.
I'm pretty sure they are, but i'm sure they can be combine even if card sizes didn't match. People have actually tried combining Pictures with the original as well for the set-up, and those card sizes are actually different shaped rectangles. I forgot which grid people have decided to use and how the pictures and words were arranged. I would have probably combined The Undercover version with the original, but my sister took the original to her school.
I immediately merged my copies and it actually works quiet well. Just be sure to filter it when bringing it to family for the holidays.

I'd say go for it.
The cards can be intertwined just perfectly fit/style wise.

So far I haven't though, I've wondered if this would create balance issues. 
> Recognise that treating everyone equitably isn't the same as treating everyone the same

This is an interesting point, and put very well. Especially the idea that not everyone will be affected or benefit equally from meaaures used to make the space accessible to everyone - its stuff we've heard before but I've never heard it put in those terms.

The author also thankfully avoids "white male terrorist" type language,  despite making many of the same points. Good read. 
As a woman in the hobby I can't say I've ever been treated differently for any reason. I don't think I've ever had someone explain to me the rules of a game I already knew in a patronising fashion (i.e. "mansplain"). I've never had inappropriate attention or behaviour directed towards me. (Asides from when I inflated an Ugg-Tect club and one of my friends said very loudly "wow you're so good at blowing," but I digress.) I attend a board gaming club at my local university and I've only played in a FLGS once, where I will not be going again as it's mainly TCGs. I've not seen women treated incredibly differently to men, but I can accept that perhaps the club's membership is very reasonable and considerate compared to the average.

However, my experience in other situations - mainly online gaming - have been absolutely terrible. I am concerned about using Tabletop Simulator online with people I don't know due to the possibility of being flamed purely on my gender. Board gaming tends to be very different as people rarely pull that shit in person... but I don't put it out of the realms of possibility. If you're there when it happens and you're at the table, don't  ignore it. People play games to escape and have fun, they shouldn't have to put up with bullshit like racist comments, sexual comments, misgendering etc.
Tip number one, don't play with asshats. Tip number two don't worry about the make up of your players because that is probably the last thing you want to think about when thinking of gaming.
Thank you for posting this!

I honestly cannot understand why there are some users here who feel like this isn't something worth discussing here. I understand keeping politics out of gaming, but this isn't politics. This is common sense.

I welcome alternative opinions on the matter if you have any.
Ah boy. Yet another inclusion campaign thread going on. Can the mods please be more objective and not join on a side? Not everyone is cool with the PC agenda being crammed down our throats.

As I mentioned in a previous post, gaming is going to be a white male dominated hobby no matter what you do. Most tabletop gamers are men. More than 75% of Americans are white. White men are going to show up more because of statistics. There is no way everyone is going to be equally represented.

Secondly, no, I don't need to subscribe to these rules or suggestion that this person makes. I go to gaming events to play a game I like, meet some people and go home. If there's a crazy psycho, it's no more upon me to do something about it as anyone else.

Thirdly, the vast majority of gaming events are filled with people that are nice, reasonable and don't do anything listed by the writer. The writer is taking one unfortunate event and painting the entire hobby with it. Yes there are going to be some weird and awkward guys, but there are also cases where some women end up being psychos as well. We can't take a few anecdotes and then use it to label an entire group of people.

If the writer wants support from gaming veterans, she should try getting to know the people who attend these events who are going to be guys. She should get to know how they are, what they deal with and what they like to play. As it is, she is taking an isolated case with a psycho, generalizing that it occurs frequently at gaming events and then demanding the gamers that she barely knows, to fix it for her.

I'm for equality, but when you want an entire community to cater for you yet you fail to understand the history of gaming culture, it comes off as very selfish. At the very least, she needs to confront this person and tell him to stop and report to her superiors that she is being harassed. No amount of regulations are going to keep the weirdos away until they actually do something. Luckily we have a system in place which is to report any wrongdoing to the person in charge. If that person doesn't do anything about it, then it's a problem. But I don't want someone telling me how I need to behave at an event I want to enjoy as I like.

So again, the way I go about gaming events is I go to them, greet others and play the games I want to play and go home. I don't need or want people telling me I "need" to stand up for equality or make an area inclusive or not. That's their fight and not everyone is going to agree with it. Gaming is generally a very inclusive hobby and anyone that says otherwise is going to need more than a handful of anecdotes to support their words.
"Mary Sue"

gag
Making gaming welcoming for everyone means welcoming for weirdos.  Sounds like this lady met a weirdo.

Before the modern boom, gaming was open to everyone: even people who were offensive or had no social skills.  Now the demand for "inclusion" is just exclusion for people who are not accepted literally anywhere else.

Nobody is trying to keep gaming white and male.  But when women come to the game store filled with men who can't get a date, they wonder why it isn't welcoming to women.

Exclusion and bullying is NOT the biggest problem in gaming.  The biggest problem is depression.
I find some of the comments made to be ridiculous "If a multi-million dollar, publicly traded company doesn’t have a sexual harassment policy in their training handbook for staff, what’s the chance my Friendly Local Game Store does?" in regards to what it was supposedly responding to - i.e. even if the company had such a policy, would Mr. I-am-entranced-by-your-femaleness have broken any rules? Nope. Though that would have changed if she had told Mr. I-think-your-smell-is-pretty that he needed to stop following her around.

But if Mr. I-want-to-be-close-to-your-fire broke a law, now that's different and resolved very easily by filing a complaint with the police. Seriously, if a friend of mine was have trouble like that it would be a choice between the police or a gang of us talking (just) to the offender and letting him or her know what's going to happen from then on.

Then she weasels her way into the subject of depictions in games... as if **Warkhammer 40K**'s depiction of Orks made Mr. I-will-make-you-love-me-by-staring-at-you want to follow her around like a puppy. As a publisher, I'm sure they are "mindful and thoughtful" when they make most all the people making important business decisions in a Renaissance game, white men. The question can be, do we need another Renaissance game?

Her two last points I am in agreement with.
Treating them like people, only being friends with guys who will do the same, and not referencing terrible blogs like *the Mary Sue*, would be my advice.

Or just the first two.
I'm conflicted about this article.

One the one hand, I really am for inclusion, safe spaces and so on - I think we should be welcoming and should strive to make the hobby a place for everyone. I myself have inducted the women I work with into the hobby, and invited them to my house for game-nights, have posted about the issue on BGG, and female representation is my tiebreaker when I'm on the fence about a game (I've skipped on more than one game becuase it had poor female representation - Hyperborea, Ultimate Warriorz, Defenders of the Last Stand etc.).

However, two things bug me about this. The first is this one:
> That’s why depictions in games matter. If the games we play "perpetuate sexist, racist and homophobic tropes, that’s not actually helping to fix the problem. For those in the business of producing games, that means being mindful and thoughtful of how you depict all people in your games. Do you have women who exist only as support or prizes? Are non-whites present in your game? If they are, are they heroic agents or are they only depicted in enemy roles? If your game has relationship mechanics, are the only ones available normalizing heterosexual ones? Think about your games and how they may be perpetuating harmful tropes. (Yes, beloved DMs and GMs, I’m speaking to you too.)"

I honestly don't like this. I think there is a difference between wanting a group to be welcoming, asking for content to be created for you, and labeling content you don't like as "Bad". I too exercise consumer-responsibility when buying games, and I talk about what I would buy, but I don't want to shame people into not making the games they want. Games with only men, or even with only white men are not morally wrong, they are just not for me. And while I might not buy such a game, it's not wrong to make it. It's not cool to claim someone is racist just because he didn't include PoCs in his game - there might be a ton of reasons for it other than racism, and this text ignores them. Not cool.

Second, is this:
> Similarly, having a zero-tolerance policy for sexist, racist, homophobic or ableist slurs doesn’t affect or benefit everyone equally, but it certainly does make the table a lot more equal.

This is a hobby, we do it for fun. I'm all for inclusive language and being nice, but gaming is my safe-space as well. If I'm at a con or something, than sure, I'll do my best to be use PC-languae. But I don't want to be guarded all the time, I don't want to fear saying something wrong, it's not cool to try and take my space and politicize it. Yes, everything is political, but so is the invasion into my hobby, my language, my space. I don't want to say "this is retarded" and get admonished because I was ableist, this kind of thing just sucks the fun out of my game, and I shouldn't be expected to give up my hobby for others. Again, not cool.
Many things here I hadn't even considered. Important read.
I always find the vote percentage on this kind of post interesting. Says a lot about the silent portion of our little community, doesn't it?
The article is obvious if you have respect for other people and some social experience, but that isn't the case for everyone so  it needs to be said. It's easy to understand how much it needs to be said by how often people bite other peoples cards, wipe snot on their hands, have poor personal hygiene etc by the comments on this board.    I just hope the people who needs to understand it reads it and gets it.
  
The article is about getting rid of dangerous and uncomfortable behavior towards women such as stalking and inappropriate behavior which is extremely important but the comments is mostly petty bullshit from people who take offense at everything.
  
The people pushing this message needs to make sure it stops there. Some of the comments give off a real tumblr vibe if you catch my drift. Especially the post about having an X card you can put in if the direction the RPG game is taking is distressing you. The one about including non-binary genders. wtf. I could go along with it jokingly but that would be considered offensive.  
  
Scantily clad men and women, slaves, etc. in boardgames where it is suitable is fine. Making a comment to a female player about how you wish she was wearing that fur bikini is not. If you feel distressed about playing an RPG where you are saving a princess you are the one who needs to adapt. If a black dude is uncomfortable playing a game with slaves like Puerto Rico ("Colonists) or Five Tribes we can play something else because i'm nice like that. But there ain't nothing wrong with the game.

I had my daughter sit with me as I played and she keeps suggesting illegal moves such as putting poker chip in mouth, putting hex tile in mouth, and putting calculator in mouth - no respect for the rules at all.
None of my family would enjoy 18xx games, but we play a lot of **Union Pacific**.
I'm going to try to introduce Trick of the Rails to my family.  Not sure if that counts, but I think it will go over well, as they have lots of experience with standard trick-taking games.
I’m planning to get an 18xx game.  I haven’t tried any of the 18xx previously so this would be my intro game.  Complexity isn’t an issue but shorter time play would be a bonus since that will make it easier to get to the table. I’m also looking for something that would play well with 3-4 players. 

Based on guides and the comments in this sub-forum there are three main games that seems to be a good alternative: 1846 and 1812.

1846 seems like it scales well from 3-5 players and seems to be well regarded as a game that can both be used as an intro and has staying power.

1812 seems like it plays well with 3-4 players and is much shorter than 1846 at 120 min rather than 240 min (though the playing time at deep thought games is listed as 3-4 hours).  I also like the idea of “mergers and acquisitions" between companies.

So, I’m wondering how the two games compare in game style and play length? Do they have the same play time or is 1812 shorter? Which one do you prefer (not as an intro game but in general)?

My wife plays games and I generally teach so in that way I certainly have introduced train games to my family. The rest of the clan, not so much. I taught her family TTR:E but our holiday time mostly revolves around young children now. Maybe I'll teach them games when they get older.
I play a bunch of 18xx games with my husband (and just played a 2p game of Rolling Stock with him last night), but excluding him, I haven't played heavy train games with anyone else in my family. We do have some good Winsome train games though, and we played **TransAmerica** with my husband's family over Thanksgiving. Everyone really enjoyed it and wanted to play multiple times. Another game that I'll want to play with my family when we visit over the holidays is **Paris Connection**, which is super easy and short, but also has a lot of strategy and is a great introduction to shared incentive games.
I don't usually get to play with my family as they live in the UK and I live in Australia. However my parents are coming for a visit in January, so some gaming will take place. I don't think that 18xx will appeal but **TTR**, **Railways of the World** and possibly **Chicago Express** should hit the table.

What does everyone think of [Iberian Rails](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/206859/iberian-rails)? It could be a new contender for a family friendly train game. Looks like it will be hitting KS in December. The rules are out.

* **Track**: Track is laid by placing cubes in hexes.
* **Character Cards**: the character you choose determines what actions a railroad may perform.
* **Occupation Fee**: must pay a fee to occupy the same hex as another railroad.
* **Hotels**: you can build hotels that will generate revenue for the player
* **Share Value**: share value increases as the number of cities a railroad is connected to increases (never decreases).
* **Open Auction & Payout**: CEO puts out 1 share; players bid to buy the share (money paid to railroad); Payout: bank pays share value to all who hold a share.
* **Closed Auction & Payout**: CEO puts out 1 share; players hold a secret bid in their hand and reveal (money paid to CEO); Payout: bank pays share value to all who hold a share.
* Personal money is kept hidden behind a screen.
* When four of the railroad companies have no share in their share reserves, or if one of the railroad companies has connected to 12 cities, the game will end after the current round.
* After the game has ended, each share held by a player pays out twice its value (as indicated by the payout table).
Recently:

- I bought Paris Connection and played with my girlfriend's family.  I like it since it is a "real game" that plays in 30 minutes.  The mechanics are easy enough for a kid to play, but the strategy is pretty solidly in the "grown-up" category.
- I broke out Ticket to Ride with my mom when she came to visit.  She is not a native English speaker, so games with lots of text are a no-go, but I knew she would like a simple set collection game like this.  On top of that, she won.  We played too aggressively trying to complete too many tickets.



Funagain games now has [North American Railways](https://www.funagain.com/control/product?product_id=036367) in stock. I really wanted to play it at BGG.CON but no one had it. It's apparently a light train card game.
Question. If my track runs into the side of a tile but does not connect, can I upgrade that tile to make it work?
Is there anyone with the know-how to create a computer program or smart phone app that lets you play 18XX games against computer opponents and/or human players? I've tried the old 1830 computer game, and it's simply awful. 

Something like this would make entering into the 18XX line of games so much easier, and I imagine it would only swell the ranks of 18XX gamers. As it is, I'm dying to give one of these games a try, but I cannot locate a single group in our area. Even if I could, I can't get six hours straight to play. I'm dying for a program like this so that I can dip a toe into the series.
Does Train Heist count as a train game? 
Color me intrigued. XCom is one of my favorite games, and I've always wondered why the tactical squadbased strategy game wasn't more common in boardgame form.
for more in-depth information, I released the first developer blog entry a week ago:
https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/59736/eureka-moment
Would you ever consider testing digitally with tabletopia or TSS? 
>Inspired by such classic computer games as X-COM: UFO Defense and Laser Squad, Invasion: Free State is a competitive urban tactical combat board game for 2 to 4 players. In each mission, Alien and Resistance factions conduct combat against each other in a desolate district of Annapolis suburbs.

>To win, you need to predict and avoid the enemy maneuvers with simultaneous initiative and action selection system. Use cover to your advantage and don't let them outflank you.

>Endless variability is provided thanks to a modular board and the unique character selection system.

Ohhhhhh *nice*.
Looks AWESOME, dropped you a PM
So, how does the action selection work? I choose that I want to move and attack for a unit, then when that unit gets activated, I get to choose how he moves and who/where he attacks?
count me in if you need an additional tester... [I'm US based!]
I'd definitely be interested. My game group is 50/50 novices and experienced so I could give you both impressions. PM'd you.
Definitely seems interesting. US based here with weekly groups of players if you still need it
PM sent
US player here, I'd love to test it out with my group! What do I need to do?
I'm loving the idea behind this game.  I logged well over several hundred hours on the PC version of XCOM and if a boardgame could capture the same "feeling" as that game, I'd be sold.  If it helps, my gaming group is small; 2 to 4 players.  Our past experience with boardgames like this is limited, so it'd be a good test to see how quickly we could pick up and learn the rules and mechanics of this game.
I'm interested!
I would happily bring this to the table to help out. I have a weekly tabletop group in the US and could prob get this tested out at all player counts and player levels.
I'd be willing to play test if you need more
US based, in a college town with gaming groups of experienced and novice gamers, would love to test an XCOM type game. 
I'd be happy to playtest with my group of friends and likely 2 sons (8 and 9)

However.........I think it'd be far more frugal to use a virtual tabletop environment.  You could make tweaks and update everyone , you don't need physical items and you dont pay any shipping.

Either that or just do print/play and have people use coins or dice as mini's
PM sent
Love to give this a try.  I found the actual Xcom board game to be underwhelming compared to the original computer games, which i've played forever.  Usually have group of 4-8 for game nights.
PM Sent! Looking forward to this!
Would also love to playtest :) PM me!
This looks interesting! I do love Xcom and the board game of it is just as great. Sign me up!
Would love to test this with our group!
I sent you a pm. I'm definitely intrigued by this game and would love to try it out and provide feedback! 
I would totally love to play this, but I unfortunately don't have anyone to play with :(
Pm sent 
To bad it's US only and will only recieve a US opinion on gameplay.
Risk has a BGG "weight" of 2.11


[Here's all the "strategy games" on BGG with weight \(complexity\) from 2.0 to 2.15](https://boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=rank&advsearch=1&q=&include%5Bdesignerid%5D=&include%5Bpublisherid%5D=&geekitemname=&range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D=2&floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D=2.15&colfiltertype=&searchuser=eckswyezed&nosubtypes%5B0%5D=boardgameexpansion&playerrangetype=normal&familyids%5B0%5D=5497&B1=Submit)

This should give you an idea of the kind of strategy games out there with similar complexity to Risk.
**Inis** is barely more complicated than Risk, and it is terrific.
**Nexus Ops** is the usual suggestion for a direct Risk replacement. The objectives and different unit types make it slightly more complex.
If I were replacing Risk, I'd replace it with Memoir '44.

That doesn't mean they are a 1-for-1 trade.  It just means if you want to play Risk, but don't want a game with design problems as dated as Risk, play Memoir '44.
For people looking for a game like **Risk** but isn't **Risk**, I'll always suggest [**Spheres of Influence**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178550/spheres-influence-struggle-global-supremacy).  This guy once brought it over and we basically were reading from the rulebook as he was figuring out the game (which I always avoid), and even with that we managed to play a 6 player game in roughly 2 hours.  The game is VERY similar to **Risk**, but it is sooooo much better and actually ends at a reasonable time.

Now that I remember, I may have to grab this one myself lol.
Viktory II is a good Risk replacement. The map is randomly generated with hexes with different terrain. It supports a high player count. 
**Risk: Europe** is risk but with auctions, planning and action selection as well as economy control. Same weight IMO but a way more interesting experience.
Game of Thrones board game and Star Wars Rebellion are good alternatives. Just played Inis, and it was great. Also Blood Rage is worth a trym
https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5fhotp/dominion_expansions/
**Prosperity** then **Seaside** would be my votes.
The art of the cards looks really good! I would love to try this game.

Also, you might want to edit the "Mechanisms" section on BGG if you haven't already done so.
This looks so awesome! I'm very interested in receiving a copy!
The art looks very cheerful. I'm happy to see it's optimum player count is 2. I'm about to have a further look into the bgg page about it, but for now I'll just make this quick comment :) 
The game looks great! Congrats on the release. What would you say was your biggest influence?

Would love to add to my collection.
Would love to play!
Though....have to say it, and seriously no offense, but am I the only one who saw "RiftwaCker" in that box font???
Looks awesome! Would love to be entered!

First off, congrats on the release! 

Second, the game itself looks gorgeous, the card art is extremely well done and kind of reminds me of Final Fantasy 8's Triple Triad in the best way. It sounds like it could be a ton of fun to play and is right up my alley in terms of game play and theme!
This looks interesting, thanks for doing this.

Aaron
This game looks dope, would love to try it with my group of newbies + seasoned gamers
Awesome that you are doing this! I'd like to enter for the giveaway!
Whooooa
Crossing fingers. Hoping for best.
What a wonderful way to do promotion. I'll take a note and do it myself when we're ready. 
Malaysia folks sad :(
Congratulations on your first release. 

Look forward to introducing this game to gaming groups I am in. 
This game looks great!! Would love to play with my friends at our weekly game nights 
Looks neat.
This looks really cool! I'd love to play
I'm down to play. 
Looks interesting would love to give it a try! Pick me!
Congrats on your first game release :)! Count me in for the drawing!
Thanks for the offer!
Congrats on your first release!  I'm interested in giving this a try.
Can this be played over a lunch break? That is typically when my group can play.  If so count me in for the drawing.
I'm interested
I don't know if this is too late but that game looks pretty cool 
Looks like an awesome game! Thanks for doing the giveaway.
I gotta say, that art is amazing! I'm always attracted to high-quality art in games, and this looks right up my alley!
Great looking game! I'm an all in backer and immediately open every update to see what new stuff is added. Over 100 very detailed mostly unique miniatures for $99 is incredible. 

I guarantee that this is one of those games where everyone is going to be posting about missing out on the Kickstarter and complaining about wanting to buy the Kickstarter exclusive figures directly from them, just like people do with Blood Rage. 

Every added stretch goal is surpassed immediately. I'm really excited for this one. 
First time I ever backed something on KS. Created an account just for this game. Right now my pledge is over $400 and it will probably rise.
Wonderful campaign lead and managed by a bunch of lovely people. The community is great too and the livestreams are always a highlight.

If you are at all interested in well designed and highly polished miniature skirmish games that come with many scenarios and campaigns for up to 4 players then [check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kQR6oFpp4U), especially the minis. The only thing I hate about it is that shipping is scheduled for December 2017. :/
I've been following along with this for about 2 weeks now, and I want to back this, but I can't help but feel like it's just going to be a mess of miniatures. I like the combat resolution, the theme, and the drafting for your army, but with all of the miniatures it just feels like too much. It almost feels like their focus is on the minis not add much the game. 
Competing against KD:M is a thing, at least for me.
Can we do add-ons during pledge manager?
Looks really cool, but not a fan of the gratuitiously sexy artwork and miniature detail. This is nonsense. One could make an argument for Conan, but Monolith didn't learn a thing from that debacle either.
All the KS exclusive addons are making me seriously consider dropping my pledge. That kind of anti-consumer business is not what I want to support.
They are different game experiences.

Guild ball is a streamlined and fast paced tabletop miniatures game with a sports theme. When goals are scored the ball is kicked back out without resetting the miniatures. It's a faster game and because it uses alternated activations you feel more engaged because there is less downtime Between your active turns.

Blood bowl is a design from the 80s, and while i enjoy it, it feels like a game from the 80s. It's generally a slower game and it's a my whole turn your whole turn activation. It shines in my opinion over a campaign where you can grow your team against 8+ other teams for league play. One off games are ok but less enjoyable. 

Both are good but despite their similarities they are very different. I would probably say i like guild ball better. 
Guild ball's box is a great offer, lots of value that would cost more if you bought all the parts independently. The pieces are a little different from what one would've typically bought piecemeal (ie minis are plastic, board is cardboard). But guildball is a very streamlined and well designed game, my favorite minis game right now.
Guildball all the way. I am an old BloodBowl player and while i grabbed the new edition of BB i still spend most of my time playing Guild Ball. The ruleset of BB shows its age, and i guess if there was no nostalgia (or Warhammer setting) behind it, the game would have a hard time finding audience today.
Give Guildball a spin, you can print out the print and play material from the official site and see how it works.

Tl;dr of pros and cons:

**Guildball**

* +/- Amazing (amazing!) metal minis, but a bit pricey (most minis are supposed to be re-released in plastic in the future)
* - The plastic minis are medicore, but that's supposed to improve in future releases
* + Fast, streamlined ruleset
* + Very little downtime thanks to alternating activations
* +++ Different characters play very differently due to their playbooks (great mechanic!)
* ++ Game is re-balanced often thanks to rotating seasons (new BloodBowl seems to be copying that approach)
* + Everything apart from the minis is free


**BloodBowl**

* + Nostalgia
* + Warhammer
* + iconic teams
* + new plastic models are great and very good value for money (Humans, Orcs and Skaven so far, Dwarves coming soon) 
* +/- pretty steep learning curve
* - old ruleset, lots and lots of downtime
* - dice rolls and risk management are super important and the game can be very punishing, in the long run it evens out for both players but it can sometimes feel that you lost the game due to dice, especially when you're new to the game.
I've ordered both this week but Guild Ball seems to be the better game overall both in terms of value and fun.  
Get a small tackle box for the technology upgrades so that you can pass that arou nwhen people upgrade.

I *highly* recommend [this how-to-play video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc2-9B2rC2g) by Off the Cuff Games for getting your bearings.

**Eclipse** is an Ameritrash game built around a Euro frame. It's an economy game first and foremost, also with PEW PEW.

Many players complain about Plasma Missiles, but they are neither broken nor overpowered. If a player is spending their time and research to get Plasma Missiles, ensure that you have instead opted for Improved Hull and shields. 

In fact, I recommend researching Improved Hull ASAP regardless of what race you're playing. If it's available, especially in the first round, get it. Tanky ships with crappy guns out last crappy ships with crappy guns. 

Google "Eclipse Tactical Bankruptcy."

Don't be afraid of Ancients. A common first complaint from new players is blaming a bad game on "luck of the draw" for Exploration hexes. If you explore and get lots of ancients around you, you might expand slower in the beginning of the game, but you will likely have a massive advantage once you start pinging the ancients, getting reputation tiles, and juicy sectors. [Related BGG link](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1527958/surrounded-ancients-strategy-guide).

There is so much good info on BGG for this game, and I'll link it here:

* [An Eclipse Exploration Primer](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/804274/eclipse-exploration-primer)

* [An Eclipse Military Primer](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/750430/eclipse-military-primer)

* [An Eclipse Economic Primer](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/760874/eclipse-economic-primer)

* [Virtual Fleets](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/740382/virtual-fleets)

However, the best tip is to give your group a few plays to explore the decision space. Figure out what you can, ask questions, check out stuff online, and give everything a chance before drawing quick conclusions about what works and what doesn't. This is a game which features a great deal of strategic depth and some emergent gameplay--give it time to grow as you play.


Make sure everyone understands that improved hull is the best technology in the game and you should never pass on acquiring it.
Important one I missed: you get a VP tile for every combat you do on a round, not just one per round
I have played 2 or 3 times and love the game. Last game we played with 9 people and the ROA expansion. Here are the few little things that tripped us up in that game.


Dice rolling in player vs player, you assign damage to a ship of your choice per cannon(dice). You can not split damage per dice. Ex. 3 damage to one ship 1 damage to another ship with a antimatter cannon.

Rolling Player Vs Ancient, ancients assign to largest ship first.

No Drives on Starbases.(They are stationary defense ships only)

Can't cover Drive on a ship. (with a technology/upgrade tile)

Pinning ships happens 1 to 1. Additional ones can move through if you want.

Rolling against population is a bit different. You can split damage from a cannon. Each damage destroys a cube.

Let people rotate their home world if the game is preset. (You can only move and explore certain directions depending on which way your home tile is oriented. Similarly you can make it more difficult for other players to advance on you depending on orientation). 

Completely missed that everyone is supposed to remove 1 population cube from a track of their choosing at the start of the game in a 7-9 player game
Its been a while since I played but these seemed to be some of the rules that come up every once in a while. 

ship locking in a system is a 1:1 ratio, before your remaining ships are free to move past them. When 1 player enters a system with another players ships. 

player stacking in a system. if multiple players enter the same system, the player who got there first is considered the defender. player 1 enters the system, then player 2 then player 3. player 2 and 3 fight each other with player 2 being the defender. then whoever wins gets to fight player 1 who got there first. 

cubes that go on grey resource spots, when they would go back to your supply for whatever reason you can pick if they go to money or science. see below.

(Rules, p10) "If a cube is returned from a gray (wild) square, you may choose which Track it goes to. Similarly, if a cube is returned from an Orbital, you may return it to either the Money or Science track."

[bgg faq](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Eclipse_FAQ)
Here is something I found when I started playing to help quickly teach otheres how to play:
https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1xr5jz/teach_eclipse_in_15_minutes_or_less/

If you want a nice quick start storage set:
http://www.daedalusproductionsinc.com/product/quick-start-insert-of-eclipse

And while is may be overkill the cube trays are nice for keeping things from scattering when things get bumped.:
http://www.thebrokentoken.com/eclipse-resource-trays/
You have to have a disk in the sector before putting cubes down.

Tech are what you research THEN you upgrade them onto ships separately. Tech has a chip on the side and stays on the tree branch

Retreating is an option that is usually glossed over. It'd apply to all groups of the same **class** during combat.

Money is important as a resource. It isn't as cool as building things or researching, but it is necessary.

**House rule** 1) for the first sector you explore, I do a pick-two-chose one. 2) starting with 2 Interceptors helps speed up the game
MISSILES!! Only missiles...
Ignore the suggestion in the rulebook that everyone play as Humans the first game. Allow people to pick between the two sides for their first playthrough. The differences between species are what make this game interesting, and it might seem boring at first if everyone's the same.

That said the Red player may very well want the Humans. Eridani Empire is a tough one to play for your first game.
Go buy it on steam its super fun to play against the ai and really gives you a great understanding on how the mechanisms work together in a real life game. 
Since most people have the rules covered one strategy tip is don't neglect your economy. Building a huge fleet and fighting is awesome but if you rush it and happen to lose your fleet you are in for a bad time.
Ship Parts fit perfect in a GMT Counter Tray. You're welcome. 
It's one of the few games where I highly recommend the expansion as the default way to play: 

* It tries to address the OPness of Missles 
* It gives you alien ships to fill in the empty starter spaces when playing with weird player counts (such as 5 or 4 players)
* It gives you more races/colors 
* It gives you an awesome alternate variant which lets the second player to pass decide the turn order of the next round
* It gives a bunch of other option rules/tiles/powers to play with - such as warp points which really open up the board and help prevent complete turtling

Also - definitely invest in a way to set up the game faster.  People recommending foamcore or tackle boxes... it's a must for this game. 
Its a viable strategy to go 'Bankrupt' i.e not have enough money for upkeep, and then uninfluence tiles to return disks to your track.

Also some new players miss that you put all your income on first before paying for what you've used.
Missiles are broken
Missiles are OP, either do research to balance them or exploit the hell out of it and make everyone rage quit.
Hey, I'm Justin. John and I created the Contender. If you have any other questions on this feel free to ask away!
Huge fan of this game and I've bought all the expansions. My friends love it too, but unfortunately by me having it they don't feel the need to buy their own copy. 

I think the momentum of The Contender is going to run out the further away we get from the presidential election. 
Find it odd that seems the biggest take away people seem to be latching onto is they screwed up not going to China. While it was a factor I don't think China would have solved there initial KS problems. As somebody who deals with Chinese companies everyday I can tell you they have there whole set of annoying issues that would have caused them almost as many problems. Every Chinese company I've dealt with will agree with you on almost any delivery you ask even if they know it is absolutely impossible. And they hate giving you bad news so they put it off until the last possible moment when you are usually completly screwed but had they told you when they first knew you could have done damage control. The only way we've been able to minimize the screw ups is by having independent staff on our payroll camped out in our suppliers. This is not something a small start-up could afford.

 
Thanks for the valuable insight on creating your own game.  These are the kind of lessons you either learn the hard way or you get super lucky and have someone share the results with you :)

I was just thinking about another Kickstarter I saw recently; the new Kingdom Monster 1.5 and how it has raised 5 million dollars instead of the 100k he was hoping for -- and how he's possibly going to manage the economies of scale on something like that.

I'm curious if you're gung-ho for going at this again with the next game, with your new found experience?


My friend an I had a [successful Kickstarter] (http://www.cultfollowinggame.com/) at the end of September, with orders for about 450 units. We kickstarted enough to break even if we purchase 1000 units from China. 

We have a decision to make soon: Order 1000 copies, sell half and break even (and then sell the rest), or order 1500 copies for 25% more at a "reasonable" initial loss. 

Our prototype shows up in a few days. What looked like an easy decision is a bit tougher now... 
Really fascinating article, thank you for writing it up and for being so honest about stuff! 
Know the feeling, but on a much smaller scale! We raised 18k for our political game back in February, with just over 400 Kickstarter orders. So we ordered 1000 and put the rest on Amazon. Funny enough, sales picked up dramatically AFTER the election, whereas we thought it was make or break pre-election. We basically broke even after election day. Now 300 copies left. Probably helped that the only candidate we directly parodied in the game, Trump, went on to win the whole thing. Now it looks more prophetic and appropriately cynical.   

Can confirm that Amazon advertising works great, though it eats lots of margin. Our Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale also came through big time. 
>Turns out, Kickstarter is a magical fantasy land where people get excited about your stuff in a way that doesn’t translate into your small business.

This reminds me of the early days of ebay.  Everyone thought that the business model was so good that every sale was a deal.  Turns out the model works really well for the website, and not so well for many of their customers.  KS will reach that point too.
Bummer it didn't go as well as you'd hoped. Hope the future is brighter.
An excellent and very important read for me as my Kickstarter is just about to end in a few days.
I think I know that print company you used... I've had a similar experience. I've done about 12 print runs and that was my most frustrating one to date.
I think it's obvious that printing in the US was by far the biggest mistake. This is a global economy. Nobody cares very much about country of origin anymore.
Seems like it should be easier to do a mass donation to schools/charities for most of those...assuming you have made enough money so far to need the writeoff.
"Don't order too many copies" seems like it should be the mantra of every Kickstarter campaign.
I'm glad you've managed to break even. Even if sounds like a rough patch, you've come out of it ok, and with important business lessons learned. Not everyone can make those claims. 

BTW - are you shipping only from inside US or do you have stock at international amazon locations too? It sounds like a game that would go over very well with my game group, but with the price already as is, if I had to import it and pay taxes on it - just wouldn't be worth it anymore.
The game is interesting to me, but still too much for me to buy. That said, I'm interested in future sales... so I tried to subscribe to your page for updates, but the email subscriber took me to a 404 page.

Just FYI,
Setting up your own distribution center may be cheaper than Amazon especially with the crazy ass Q4 price increase they just had.

A storage locker, PayPal, WooCom and Shipstation with a USPS or UPS account and you can distribute much cheaper than Amazon. 

I run 400 shipments a day with a staff of 3 using the above system.
I've said this before in my KS rants but what's crazy to me is the same mistakes happen over and over but they keep happening. How is this possible? Let's say nobody in the history of the world, ever explained how much storing items for Amazon Fulfillment Services costs. Let's say this data is not available even from Amazon themselves. Now that this Medium post was published, do you think a future board game Kickstarter will have an issue with coming up with money to pay for the Amazon storage costs? Yes, probably.

What about other common KS lessons. How about the Lunar/Chinese New Year shutdown? Or the cost of shipping around the world? Or the speed at which ships from China take to reach America. Or thicker cardboard equals heavier box? 

I like KS as a platform for new entrepreneurs to learn the ropes but learn new lessons like putting together a business plan, or pitching your ideas to investors, or teaching yourself Illustrator to great a logo or graphics for your game. I don't want KS to be used to learn the same lesson (mistake) that is literally done over and over.
Read to question one, thought to myself, "you chose USA instead of China didn't you?"

*keeps on reading*

Yep ... that explains it.
I know I'm probably going to get downvoted for this and I deserve it but am I the only one tired of CAH clones? Never ceases to amaze me how even straight up rip offs with similar sounding names manage 500+ positive reviews in Amazon and put out 20 expansions (this one even raunchier!). At least this one is an somewhat original take on the concept.

That said, the post is great and even if it is marketing (and **it is** that), I wish all marketing was like that.
Px3 is the news for me. Yes sir got it going right there with a Justin in a onesie and a parrot looking fly its time for a salute as we watch it all die. Im gonna cry. Thought I had a socialist guy with democratic tendencies but really just the DNC playing with my heart strings and now we got some real things to worry about cause we're out of time for the HRC and the only light in front of me is the face of a train. Will it run me over? Cause me pain? I don't know. Time to wait and see for the man who disgusts me. What will his policy be on democracy? Please include we the people. Not just the few or the evil. J-U-R-Y thank you for your time. You kept me entertained. Now your insanity keeps me sane. I have you to blame for some good laughs and a great game. I hope you rise even further into fame because your debt and loss has been my sincere gain. Thanks all the same. 
One of my favorite podcasters on my favorite subreddit. Truly the end times! <> 

FWIW people, the contender was just as fun this past weekend as it was during the election cycle. I bought the base game and the Politically Incorrect expansion and probably the only party game that gets more table time is Secret Hitler.
We've had several articles with the cost of KS but this was really excellent information about the different marketing avenues available for KS and how effective they are.
As someone who used to work in the printing industry, TWO FUCKING WEEKS FOR PROOFS? WTF?

Sounds like their problem was their sales rep thought they were small potatoes and not really taking care of them, or the company as a whole thought they were uninmportant and didn't give a shit about them.

It should never take more than 48 hours to get proofs from any credible printing company that handles prepress in house.
This is why I always find it funny when people assume that a company is rich after their Kickstarter. It doesn't matter if you raised $5k or $5m. There are a ton of costs in regards to fulfillment before anyone sees any profit. I'm always surprised when some companies can do this as a living because I have a hard time seeing big profits coming out of board games. I think a lot of people still do this as a side job, even successful designers. 
<>
I will be buying several copies of this game. This is a great article and pepper who make games like this deserve to be rewarded with a lot of money for their efforts. Cheers, mate! 
Have you ever considered to translate the game in other languages? 
Liked the storey, liked the look of the game, wanted to buy it but it cost me $28 to just get it posted to Australia. If there was a reasonable price to get it here I would buy it.


Very nice read, thanks for posting, and best of luck with your business venture! :)
u/JohnTeasdale_

Hi,

I actually remember your game, was in a save money mode though and didn't end up getting it sorry, will be looking at your website later today.

I had a question if you don't mind. It sounds like you've done other board game launches before, from your article. Did they go better or worse then this one and do you feel that the previous launches had in retrospect, given you enough knowledge to deal with the Contender's development and launch?

Do you feel the content of the game might have had something to do with sales? You had a few things going "against" it perhaps. A dicey political cycle, some say a CAH type game, being American Flavored vs something lets say Europe could feel ok with. 

Thanks for your time.
Sorry if this has already been addressed, but on your website, I can't tell if the The Contender Holiday Special" has all of the expansions or not. Does it include the Battle for New York, Battle for St. Louis, Battle for Las Vegas?

Also, are you really a patriot who gives a damn?
Thanks for writing this up guys, I have two quick questions.

1) I'm in the UK do you know if the best way to get your game buying direct from you? Amazon.co.uk has 1 copy and it's £105

2) If I'm buying on your website and grab the Holiday special bundle, do I only need to add the TV and Movie expansion to it to have everything? 
As a kickstarter backer of The Contender, I wish you guys well with this issue. I've thoroughly enjoyed this game, and if I knew 5,000 people, I'd force them to buy it also. 
Just one other thing for the creators of The Contender to consider (pinging /u/JohnTeasdale_ , /u/JustinRyoung and any other employees in the thread) in addition:

I, as a person in Denmark, cannot buy your game from Amazon. Your game simply does not ship to Denmark, either from the UK or US version of the game. It's not available through the German Amazon unless I want to pay some scummy reseller over 100 Euro for the game.

I might be able to order the game from your own website, I haven't checked that yet. But not being able to buy it from Amazon is a PITA.

I notice that the standard / standard + NSFW version of your game was available worldwide through your Kickstarter, but not any of the fancier versions. I'll be honest, that's kind of a turn-off to me as an international backer, too.
From reading this, it sounds like y'all rushed through this hoping to make some easy cash and didn't take the time to have a complete game plan before you even started the Kickstarter. 
All four colors are equivalent. None of them are harder or easier than the others, nor more likely to be coda. Currently on my second play through (bought it again to share with different group). Had Blue the first time and Black this time.
Ours was red. I think there's the same number of cities and similar connections as yellow.
I've played two campaigns. One was black, one red. I think neither was harder than the other. I speculate that yellow would be the worst.
Ours was yellow because we generally neglect yellow in Pandemic. 

I think it was probably the hardest since a large portion of yellow is less in line with the rest of the world which resulted in our entire South America and Africa being a mess by the end of December. I could see though how having the central portions of the map disrupted could make it harder especially with the potential spreading into other colors that could occur. 
Ours was yellow but I think it's just a coincidence, shouldn't be more likely than any other color
I really enjoy it. My wife loves the **Legendary** games, but since getting **Xenoshyft** it's basically replaced Legendary for us.
I have the game. It's pretty easy to teach, but hard to win. Teamwork is important, but it also feels like you're each playing your own game. I like the game but it's not for everyone. Check out a gameplay video if you still want to get it.
I would say the game is fairly easy to teach, but there are some minor ambiguities in regard to card play and timing that you may need lo look up clarifications on. Specifically in regard to playing actions in response to reveal effects. 

I think the challenge is fair, but certain item card setups will definitely work better than others. Part of predicting what to do in any given game is going to rely on your knowledge of the cards and their effects, but this is true for a large number of games. I would also recommend playing the variant/updated rules that have you play three alien cards per row on rounds 1, 4, and 7; four cards on rounds 2,5, and 8; and four cards with a boss shuffled in for rounds 3, 6, and 9. This ensures you have a little bit of breathing room as you jump up to the next wave of enemies and builds up the difficulty with each wave. The rules as written in the book could result in your meager army having to face off against a boss enemy right out of the gate, which I would argue is not fair or particularly fun. 

As with all games of this type, quarterbacking is a potential problem, but as others have argued elsewhere this is ultimately a player problem not a game problem. I find the cooperative nature of this game to be a bit stronger than in others because you can play cards on any player's row in an effort to help them. 

This is one of my favorite games, due in large part to the theme, but I realize it is not a game for everyone and I do find the game runs a little long for what it is.
I personally don't recommend it. It is basically a solitaire game that your friends play at the same time.

If you want a coop deck builder, look at the Legendary Encounters games.
Has some good ideas, but ultimately, extremely slow and clunky. Hoping the next game will fix things.
The app is fun. No way I would pay full price for a simple card game. This game as it is is over priced and over produced. Should be 20 dollars and it woulf be amazing.

[OP Disclosure]:

My game Fog of Love is mentioned and I'm f*****g proud:


"...Fog of Love is my number one game by such a wide margin that it's frankly a little ridiculous..."


I love you too Tom! 
Thanks for the report. Really interested in trying this one. Do you feel it will hold up after multiple plays? Is there a random set-up that makes each game unique?


I'm so salty that this ran out of stock on CSI while it sat in my cart waiting for their sale shenanigans... Want it so bad. 
I hadn't heard of this game before. Sounds rad. I'll keep an eye out for it. Thank you for posting!
I can't wait for my copy to be delivered. I've got my playgroup excited for this game as well. It's going to be our first coop experience! 
Reviews say that it's a lot of collect and deliver for gameplay. How would you say that it is or isn't?
Yeah I just may have to give this one a go.  It certainly is very dark and seemingly intense which I absolutely adore on principle alone.

Thanks for the posting and commentaries on your two rounds of it!
i hope to play this soon
Do you worry about the longevity of a coop you beat on your second attempt? 
[Paradox](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1345857031/paradox-a-sci-fi-puzzle-boardgame)?
I wonder if you could turn CoH into a deck builder....
Before codenames became widely available I used the cards from **Snake Oil** along with poker chips and the codenames app.
mario chess, it's got some really cool minis that i've reused into a mario themed king of tokyo
Not a perfect example because I like both games, but I can play **Battle Line** with my **Parade** deck. Just remove the 0s, and add some markers/tokens for flags. 
Treehouse can be sufficiently explained here as by the same designer as Fluxx. 

The plastic pyramids from multiple copies of Treehouse can be used to play a much better game, Zendo. Zendo is a game of logic, where players are trying to guess the rule.


I repurposed the miniatures from Risk Legacy for use in my old El Grande set. 
MtG: Arena of the Planeswalkers has a boatload of miniatures at an insanely low price. I got my copy for 12bucks. Now I can prototype all sorts of game pieces!
**Arcadia Quest: Inferno** is a stand alone game with new tiles, gear, heroes, etc with the added mechanisms of Damnation, Angels, and changes to the campaign structure.

*Arcadia Quest* is a great game that I love. I personally only own the standard retail version with no expansions or kickstarter extras and I still love it. I recommend it to anyone that this kind of game would appeal to and would not let FOMO dissuade them.

Last update for *Inferno* is that it should be getting to backers by January, not sure how much longer until retail.

At this point I guess you could wait.

I think you should buy both. You can mix and match heroes and they wrote *another* campaign that combines the two sets.
Ah I didn't know that about another campaign which mixes both! That settles it then, will buy AQ and then AQI later...😎
AQ is amazing and one of my favorite games. It near perfectly captures the brawl feeling and getting look is amazing. It's hands down my favorite dice chucker. I own the retail base game and the retail Beyond the Grave. Beyond the grave is very close to the perfect expansion in my mind. It offers more of the same greatness but deeper mechanics and really takes advantage of the system they have built. If you have people to play it with you will not be disappointed with AQ.  
  
I am also all in on AQ:I and it looks similar to Beyond but might be trying a little to hard with the new mechanics. I don't doubt it will be amazing plus adding an entire campaign bridging the two base games adds more than enough extra flavor. People often complain about hero variety, but rght now I own 14(12 in the base and 2 in Beyond) and its a blast it lets you get very familiar with character and try out fun synergies, I predict it will be kind of a shit show when the bazillion extra characters come in with AQ:I. Plus if you really need extra heroes they have all the character cards on the website you can just print out and use proxies.  
  
The only cool thing about AQ:I that is really unique are the Dragons, normally after the 6th mission a winner is crowned and you can start a new campaign. With the AQ:I kick starter they introduced 4? new huge dragons that you have to fight in a 7th scenario where it is fully co-op between all the guilds to kill a giant dragon. These are not unique to the kick-starter and you can get them at retail.  
  
&nbsp;  
tl;dr - AQ even just the base game is amazing get it and play it, if you fall in love with it there is so much extra content you can pick up later.
If you have enough people to start playing AQ then go get AQ now, you'll want AQ I after you play AQ ;)
Its a standalone expansion from what I read.

You'll probably have to wait for a while to acquire it. It builds upon a few things from the base game, so I guess its a matter of your tastes. I just got AQ by trade and I am excited af.
Wait for the Inferno. It's the same game with some added mechanisns. If you get the first AQ, you might need to spend the extra money for the inferno afterwards.
I am currently deployed overseas as well.  Some compact games that we enjoy are:

- One Night Ultimate Werewolf

- Resistance Avalon

- Star Realms

- Bang!: The Dice Game

- Pandemic

- Cutthroat Caverns

- The Grizzled

- The Manhattan Project

Some not-so-compact games but fun:

- Eldritch Horror

- Cosmic Encounter

- Agricola

- Letters from Whitechapel


When I worked at a FLGS the owner would send his overstock of CCGs and other card games to customers who were deployed, and they really liked them. These guys were army, so anything with only cards was great since they were living in tents and moving around a lot.  
Coup would probably be a good choice, or any of the vast array of small card games out there. Codenames should be good as well.  
My experience was that people in the military liked Magic the Gathering a lot because they could reliably find people to play with no matter where they were stationed/deployed. The new decks are balanced and pretty well built so a few of those would let multiple people play, and give the fun of deckbuilding, etc.
Nobody else has mentioned it, but my vote is for **Skull**. Once he's played it once or twice, it can be easily made from any deck of cards.

The art is cool, and there aren't enough components to scare off non-gamers. The core mechanic is approachable by poker players (which I'm sure all of his army buddies are) but the game is fast and small enough play anywhere.
**Codenames** and **Resistance** are huge hits on my ship, especially with people who don't play board games normaly
Hive Pocket
So I'm thinking these should be the criteria:

* Small volume once you throw the box away. 
* Accomodate a variable player count.  
* High replay ability.  
* Chance to develop some sort of meta, as I expect it will get played over and over again.

With these in mind, I'd like to recommend **Libertalia**.  
The whole game is 180 cards and a bag of chits (The boards are a little smaller than the size of the box, but they're totally unnecessary really.).  
The game plays 2-6 and does so well at all counts. A small game is very cerebral, while a large game is chaotic and hilarious.  
There are a lot of potential hand combinations, and tweaking them even a little can change the whole dynamic. Each game feels like a different puzzle.  
Once you're past your first couple of plays, the game is almost entirely in your head. It's about reading other people, predicting what they want, how they plan to get it and how you plan to stop them. In that way, it can be a bit like poker, where playing over and over with the same group will deepen the gameplay.
Resistance/Avalon

One Night Ultimate werewolf

Onitama, for a chess-like game

codenames
Boots on the ground? 
I think your initial thoughts are correct.  Keeping the box size low (If you were wanting to send some heavier/thinkier games there's some fantastic Phil Eklund games that are small in stature but loaded with game) is a definite help and yeah getting to play w/buddies will be tops.  
I might sound like a broken record by now, but i would suggest **Space Hulk Death Angel** while you can still get it.  
It is a rather small game that you can play coop or solo. Even without the expansions (all expansions fit into the small box for the base game) there is a lot of replayability. With the expansion you got even more.
Splendor expansion?  I'm excited.
The [Zendo9 2.0 video](https://youtu.be/mstV9dc6swA) shows Zendo using large (pipless) Pyramids, along with similar sized Blocks and Wedges, rather than different sized Pyramids. The response from people play testing suggests this will reduce some of the mathy rules, which I think is probably a good thing.  I'd love to play test it to see how it changes things. 
>Splendor expansion


Hmm, game doesn't really need it one, but I'm curious.
Was the sneak peek for Mountains of Madness just the bare BGG page or am I missing something?
Dammit. I read that as Daviau's Mansions of Madness. 
yay for splendor expansion.  This is one of my fav games to play.

Its great to teach as a gateway game.

Its light enough to play without getting irritated.

I can't say enough good about it.  I love the game.
The use of risers to create curved shots is inspired.
Great job man! I made a "Pool Golf" game way back in the day to put on a pool table at my local pub. You use a Styrofoam ball and can flick it or put both index fingers on the table and use your thumbs to lob it. It was great fun and we would often get a crowd going watching us. Each person took turns setting up the next hole.

We stored the whole thing in a bag in the closet and the owner threw it out one weekend thinking it was trash. Ehhh. I never had the heart to remake it.

I thought this was pretty cool. Kinda reminds me of Ice Cool. This was posted on my local Disc Golf FB page and I thought it was unique enough and cool to show you all! He starts playing at 5:15
Very cool!  I can imagine set up for 18 holes would be a pain but that looks like a ton of fun!
Very cool idea. I'm also impressed with the putting ability on display.
Very cool. Reminds me of a wooden hockey game I made as a kid when I was in scouts. Sort of like this: http://www.vgwoodplans.com/hockinole2014b.jpg

Possible improvement to your design might be to separate the base peg board into pieces that could be rearranged into different shapes. Then you could leave pegs in to create different tiles that could be rearranged in a variety of ways. Would speed up setup time and allow the holes to be moved. Only challenge would be coming up with a way to connect the boards without creating a bump between edges that would hurt the gameplay.
This is a very neat DIY to do with a kid. Pretty cheap parts can be done all with hand tools, and minimal labor and lots of room to experiment.
Looks like a lot of fun! Have you thought of any ways to make hole setups go more quickly?
Funny I was just watching this on the disc golf sub and then I came here and its here as well.
This is pretty cool. Good practice for flick em up
Thank you for sharing. 

I am part of a club who not only focuses on board games but also classic and modern wooden based games. From Molkkÿ to Shuffleboard to old french games. Nearly all of these wooden based games are made by our members.

As we have not decided which games we will be making this next year, TableTop Disc Golf sounds quite persuading and interesting. 

Thanks!
This is fantastic!
Awesome inspiring work!  Keep it up!

>I already have Battlecon and while I love it a great deal it's hard to get other people to share in my love of the fightahn.

Do you really think that buying any of the games you listed will change this though?
**Exceed**. The barrier of entry is low but also requires a lot of time to master. My problem with BattleCON is that you need around 10+ games to get familiar with how the pairs to work and how the bases interact in a RPS relationship before you can grasp what's going on. This is quite the task to teach unless you have someone that is willing to invest the time.

With Exceed, right from the get go, you have a general idea of how you can succeed with your character based on his/her special ability, character cards and Exceed mode. The decisions are more micro so even as a newbie, it's easier to work the strategy you have in mind.
There is also **Dragon Punch**, which is super portable and very cheap.
I quite like it. It feels like Power Grid. But it only takes an hour or so even in the 5 player game. 

A few people I've played with didn't like not having the map, they actually like that aspect of the game. Without the map, the game comes down to evaluating the worth of power plants and timing your turn position to get the best ones and easy access to resources.
I haven't played it, but the two people that I know that have played it liked it very much.  
I'd like to know about the release date too (and also, those who have played it - where?).


I was super excited, but after watching a play through,vi think I'll pass. It didn't seem as mechanically interesting to me as Power Grid, and I really dont like the artwork. 
I ended up printing out and laminating 8 card-sized location lists for all players to hold. Players often look at their role cards so it isnt too suspicious for a spy to look at the location list. 
I have Spyfall too but yet to play. I've downloaded and printed some player aids off BGG tho with one side having all the location in the game and on the other side, I've put some suggested questions to ask. Print out 8 copies and pass one each to all players before starting.
4 is not an ideal number for any straight social deduction game, but perhaps you could try to deal out a 5th card no one can see so that occasionally no one is the spy? And you can make accusations against the 5th card as if it were a player should you feel no one may be the spy?

This game shines at 6 or more but gets good around 5 players, though. I wouldn't recommend it for only 4 players.
I personally wouldn't even teach them **Spyfall**.  Instead teach them how to play **A Fake Artists Goes To New York**.  It's the exact same game, except you are drawing instead of answering and asking questions, which is SOOOO much easier for new players, even if they can't draw.

After they get used to the concept of one player trying to stay hidden, then move onto **Spyfall**.  But be prepared for some people to prefer **Fake Artist** because of its simplicity.
**Android: Netrunner**

The most interesting, deep, and rewarding game in my experience. The design of that game is just breathtaking, and with the first rotation of tournament legal cards as well as the core set 2.0 coming early next year, I think it will only get that much better. That will also be an ideal jumping on point, as it will make the barrier to entry a lot less as far as cost. I think it's firmly a lifestyle game though, because even teaching it casually is a really hard mountain to climb, and it only reveals it's depth and beauty when you dig into the vast card pool and learn the main deck archetypes, etc. The asymmetry of the Corps/Runners and all the factions and identities within makes it more rewarding than any other card game I've played. I no longer play because my group moved on to A Game of Thrones 2.0, which I also love but is also much more casual friendly, a big plus in my eyes. 

**X-Wing**

Another brilliant FFG design, but even more of a lifestyle game IMO. Requires a hefty investment, sometimes in ships you don't even want just for the cards to use for other ships (my big beef with their model) or multiples of ships just to try out some things. This game is a lot more approachable casually than Netrunner, but the competitive scene is probably the next best thing to MtG as far as organized play, community events, etc. 

**Dominion** 

This would be my choice for a game that can offer the most content after an initial investment. I only have the base set and 4 expansions, but that alone is enough for years and years worth of games without anything getting stale. Even playing with the same set of cards over and over is interesting because you can try new strategies within them. The newer sets (Adventures and Empires) are some of the best expansions for any game I've ever played. 

**Millenium Blades**

This is my wild card pick, as it's a traditional one box game, but it comes with a ton of "expansions" that make the core game play differently each time without changing any mechanics. It's a game full of interesting card combos and interactions much like Dominion, and the longevity comes from mixing sets and finding the best way to capitalize on what's available, but with the twist of real time pressure keeping you on your toes. 
GO

cheap entry and infinite depth
>Also, for Magic/Codex/Dice Masters/Dominion players, is a static Cube of, say, 500-1000 enough to last a long time of many plays/decks/customizations? Or is that not enough?

I can speak for Magic - A cube of 720+ (i.e. enough for 16 players or 8x players with 2x completely different card sets) is enough for a very long time. Luckily pruning, adding, and adjusting it in small ways will prove to be fun and prolonging what you can or can't do. You can try new themes, remove and add things you like or dislike, or put in answers that you feel are necessary due to overpowered strategies. 
Shut Up & Sit Down has not the same level of production, but for me, it's waaay better
[The first episode of the new series of TableTop came out two weeks ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0536RUasM0). The first episode is on YouTube, then it's going to be an exclusive on a service called Alpha for a few months. They say the full series will come to YouTube in early 2017.
Girls Game Shelf is similar in style but doesn't have the same polish." Season 2" just started airing.

Depends on what you're looking for. As for production quality, Rodney Smith's **Watch It Played** videos have excellent A/V quality and are meticulously produced to be excellent learning resources for the games they cover. They're not entertaining, however, which is a lot of what Tabletop has going for it. 

I enjoy **Shut Up & Sit Down** for the entertainment value, but their video quality and presentation of the games is all over the map so I can't use them as an authoritative source for making buying decisions. 

I don't know of any other series that offers consistently well-produced content that's both informative *and* entertaining.
Shut up and sit down has better everything.  Humor, production values, etc.
Eldritch Horror might work.  It has an Indiana Jones globe trotting adventure feels, but clearly has the Cthulu theme, which may or may not please you.  I have never played it with two, but I have seen other say it plays just fine that way, but I don't know if 2 players would be able to keep it under 2 hours or not.
I'm very interested to see what other suggest as I'm also looking for a great adventure game.  With that in mind I have a few suggestions:

**Xia: Legends of a Drift** is a sandbox style adventure sci-fi.  Trade goods and be a merchant, take on and complete missions, be a pirate and irritate your friends, explore space, be a miner!  Lots of paths to take, and you can set the length of the game by shortening the amount of fame points needed to end the game.  One of my favorites.

**Runebound**(2nd or 3rd is fine) is an adventure fantasy.  Explore and fight monsters, buy and upgrade your items, weapons and armour until you are powerful enough to take on the final boss.  First one to do it wins so you can set the pace by competing hardcore,  or agree to take your time and build up your characters until you are satisfied. 

**Defenders of the Realm**.  I have never played it but have seen it recommended a few times.  Adventure style game with a fantasy setting.  Looks neat, but check it out for yourself to see if it's up your alley.

Those are the closest I know to Fortune and Glory.  Honestly, play wise I would say **Runebound** felt the most similar to it. 
Relic Runners
Escape: Curse of the temple
Incan Gold
Lost Cities
The Adventurers: Pyramid of Horus (out of print but might be able to find one)

Look at these! All have an indiana jones style theme. But most aren't adventure games.


I have the mat, and the pieces from the game fit just fine. What do you think is wrong with them? 
Yes it is perfectly fine to print yourself a boardgame. The mechanics of any game are not protected by any copyright law. The artwork itself and the design are more fiddly in this area so I would refrain from using those.

Do keep in mind that 50% of the beauty of this hobby is the actual fact of possessing a nice looking product. 

And no, "most board games" are not just "a set of rules and rolling dice". This sentence could not be further from the truth.
Most? Really? If you say so...

But anyhow, the answer is yes, there are print-and-play games out there.
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1120/print-play
Headphones warning at the kickstarter video.
The box is only 4 pounds? Come on Steve Jackson Games. Is that the best you can do?
After all that the rules are still a mess? That's a bummer.
I'm a big fan of this game. I agree the game was a mess (rules-wise) when it shipped. I think the 2.0 rulebook is good and the cards are a huge step up.

My group really loves this game because the system allows for some player authorship in the content you encounter. We love the tile icons and how they suggest what you find in the free questing mode. I also love that we now have the opportunity for modules which are more directed scenarios, so there's the best of both worlds.

The individual asymmetrical player decks for each character are awesome. Yes, sometimes you get bad draws. That happens in Dominion as well. Maybe you should be able to play cards face down for minor effects, but we roll with it and have a great time. 
I haven't brought myself to try the game yet. Do I need to invest in the 2.0 replacement cards, or is it enough to just print the 2.0 rulebook?
I thought this game was a myth.
Sounds like a 4X game may be up your alley. Give Eclipse a shot. If you want to dive off the deep end and can get people to play for 8-10 hours, Twilight Imperium 3E. 
you definitely want **Twilight Imperium**
Take a look at fireteam zero. Wave 2 should be sometime this spring. The base game is really well done. Similar to Gears of War in that it's dudes on a map with cards = HP, but it's also very well designed imo. There's deck building over the course of a campaign, prob takes 4-5hrs to finish one off and it's actually not that terrible to set up. 
How about **Cosmic Encounter** or **Mythos Tales**?
It doesn't really fit the theme you're after, but when it comes to me and my friends the only heavy strategic game that exists is diplomacy. Everything else is casual and random.
Pre-Orders for **A Handful of Stars** from Martin Wallace is up. Seems like something you could like. It's has deckbuilding and area control that plays 2-4.
You should give Galaxy Defenders a try. Sounds exactly like what you want
Our two favorites of 2016 are Terra Mystica and Scythe. It sounds like they're right up your alley. Both are highly engaging, leave you hanging on every turn, and create serious shit talk in our crew. I love how when the games wrap everyone is conversing and analyzing about how they could have played better. 

Scythe isn't difficult to learn, has a guide built in for beginners (first 5 turns), solo-mode, and is exceptionally well balanced. I think it's theme comes through very well; some games will be a total Cold War, while others are a battle Royale. Plus, the new expansion allows you to play up to 7! 

TM is challenging to learn at first, but insanely rewarding if you dig Euros like Agricola. TM's balance is all over the place; so basically you adjust for better players by playing different races. We play this so much we bought acrylic overlays for the player boards. Totally worth it. 

We play the hell out of both of these games, sometimes we flip a coin bc it's too difficult to decide which to throw down on the table. TM holds special fondness for me as it was the game that turned my (non-gamer) wife into a tabletop addict. 
I hate how stoners co-opted that fantasy creature.
I like Carcassonne, Alhambra, Colt Express, Dungeon Fighter, Voluspa, Xenon Profiteer, Tobago, Above and Below, Concordia, Rococo. Nothing too heavy, nothing with much serious conflict.
Hey man have you ever played board games........ *on weeeeed*?
I've played [Wink](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13507/wink) as a big stoned group, and it was amazing lol. One of the goofiest games ever
**[Mushroom Eaters](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135508/mushroom-eaters)** is widely considered one of the most unique games ever made. It also supposedly has some good art.

And it is, of course, the perfect answer to your question.
Sounds like Twilight Imperium is exactly what you're after.
While I can't speak from experience, in theory I think Tokaido would work really well.
**Stoner Fluxx**
If you're mostly playing 2 player I'd stay away from exploding kittens, in my experience it takes way too long as a two player and it gets almost tedious to finish a game. 

Edit: ticket to ride Europe is great, but you might want to look into one of the maps that's smaller and that plays better with 2 people. The Europe map is big and it's very easy to avoid each other and find alternative routes at 2 player. The big cities expansion in the 1912 expansion also does a good job of tightening up the Europe map for two players. Also Nordic countries is the full game, just on a smaller meant to be played by 2-3. 
Maybe throw a dexterity game in there. Junk Art, perhaps?

You probably don't need two deck builders to start (paperback and dominion). One should be fine until you know if that's what you're into.  I will warn that Dominion can be a little bland without an expansion.  My go to deck builder right now is "Clank!"

My go to two player card game is 7 wonders duel though Lost Cities is solid. 7WD just has more depth without adding a ton more complexity.
This might be a weird recommendation, but you could check **1775 Rebellion** for an entry wargame. My girlfriend likes it a lot. It's a really simple game that plays under 2 hours and is lots of fun, but offers enough strategy to last for quite some time.

These would be my recommendations:
Definitely **Concordia** with the **Salsa** expansion (for a better 2 player board), **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Discoveries**, **7 Wonders Duel**, **Jaipur**, **Imperial Settlers** and **Five Tribes**. Maybe also **Dead of Winter**, but you'll need more than 2 for this one.
I've been into board games for a few years now, and one that I still love even after hundreds of plays is **Castles of Burgundy**. It plays VERY well with 2 players, but also plays 3 and 4 players equally well. **Patchwork** is also great, but it's strictly 2 player, so you won't be able to play it when you have anyone else over.

Honestly though, I think you did a pretty good job honing down a list of varied games that would be fun to own.
Bracelet and some scented candles, bro.
Kosmos has a line of popular 2 player games, like Kahuna 
Kanagawa. Easy to learn, still challenging, multi-purpose cards, and GORGEOUS components! 
I think you need some type of euro engine builder in your collection. I'm a big fan of the variable & simultaneous action ones, like **San Juan**, which is a great place to start. Puerto Rico, Race for the Galaxy and Roll for the Galaxy are related games with the same action selection mechanic. I like engine builders, where you're building a collection of cards/tiles with abilities which are all helping each other towards a common strategy. The nice thing about these simultaneous action games is that there's little down time, since even when it's someone else's turn you still generally get to do something. 
You cant go wrong with Castles of Burgundy.. If its just a 2 player from your list id say that... Pandemic, Splendor are your best bets.

If you want to UPGRADE Splendor then choose Viceroy instead. also these games play great with more people as well as 2 players.

To be fair ive never played lost cities/cthulu realms, patchwork, arbetorum or exploding kittens.  But i have played the rest.

Also definitely get Codenames for company, its a good party game and like you said it's cheap.

If your girlfriend isnt much into competition and likes co op, Pandemic is alright, good play throughs. I'd COUNTER Dominion with Shadowrun Crossfire. That's one of my FAVORITE Deckbuilding games , and you can actually 'level up' your characters in that and work towards a goal/upgrade your people. 

If she needs a more basic deckbuilder i actually prefer Star Realms over Dominion ;x.
I would say all of the above would make a really good 'foundation' of a games cupboard

**Istanbul** is also an excellent game that plays well with two and scales up to five - very thinkie, quite short, always different due to board setup

**First Class** is a new game this year, and again because of the dependence on which cards become available and when, it's always different and requires adaptive tactics rather than fixed strategy

**Puerto Rico** is a classic, but can be tricky for new players in a group with experience


Personally, I'd go with a Paperback and forget about Dominion. They are fundamentally very similar, but Paperback has the added fun of making words in your hand instead of playing cards that simply tell you what to do. Paperback is a lot more fun in my opinion.
Well, it depends on what you guys like, Fury of Dracula one person plays Dracula, the rest play vampire hunters and try to find and kill him before he gets too strong. Its less man vs game and more PvP. I mean since you gave very few preferences, mechanics, etc.. I'm just going to say hit board game geek, look at their top100 click on names of games that sound cool to you and go from there.
If you like co-ops but are competitive group as well I would suggest:  
**CO2** - semi cooperative game where players are against each other until the moment they need to work together, so they all don't loose the game. Every player is CEO of an energy company that needs to add green plants (and stop pollution by reducing fossil fuel power plants). In order to do that you need to propose project, install project and construct power plant, while in the process other players can continue where you stopped until power plant is constructed (which means you can prepare everything for someone else even that is not your intention). It is mid (on heavier side) euro game with interesting theme and good mechanics.
Fury of Dracula is a pretty solid bet. It's a 1vX game where the 1 is Dracula. But, be weary that as Dracula there can be a lot of downtime for that player, if your group isn't particularly fast.

**Ghost Stories**: Ghost Stores is another Cooperative game where you play as Shamans trying to rid the world of Ghosts that keep popping up into existence. It's really hard, and could make for a fun competitive environment to see who can kill the most Ghosts. To be frank, I doubt you'll win. It's very hard.

Semi-Cooperative Game: CO2 u/httprequest has got you with a good one. How about another one, **Dark Moon**: One of my favorite semi-cooperative games where players are trapped upon the Dark Moon Titan trying to survive in this somewhat desolate mining facility. It becomes quickly clear to you that someone has gotten infected on the ship, and is trying to quickly infect other crew members. It's about a 60-80 minute game of Dice Rolling and deception.

**Mysterium** : Considering I don't know how big your group. Lets look at one of the most beautiful looking games ever, and plays like a cookie crumble of broken images that players need to deduce information from to understand who murdered them and is the mastermind behind it all. It is a wonderful game, but if your group is larger than 4-6 people on average look for a game called **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong**. I prefer Deception, but I think it only does well at its higher player counts of 6-9 players.
Take a look at **Terra Mystica**, closer to Catan than the other, but without dice and more depth. A staple game that my group comes back to over and over.

/u/r2d8 getinfo
Have you taken any looks at suburbia? It's a tile laying game (only for four players sadly) where you build your own area of a city. You *are* doing your own thing, but your decisions often influence others in a slightly passive-aggressive way than most euro games, so your playgroup might like it. It's one of my favourites :)
> I play games with a decently sized, open minded group of people. We all got hooked on Catan and have since started branching out. Our running favorite is Eldritch Horror, with Pandemic mixed in as well. We like Co-op games but are also a competitive group.

/u/mrbananagrabber1, this honestly just isn't helpful as it lacks in specificity.

Could you please be more specific as to the number of players, and what you're looking to expand towards? Do you want something that's a 3+ hour affair, or a light party game? How much conflict do you want in the game, and how much "brain burn" is appropriate? What price point are you considering?

Without this sort of information, people are going to just be shooting in the dark, more or less.

That being said, **Fury of Dracula** is quite popular but also quite lengthy. It can easily take three hours, especially on your early plays. If you're interested, you might want to pick it up sooner rather than later, as it's gone out of print.
Arcadia quest is player vs player vs the board.    Everyone is trying to complete goals together or separately while killing each other too.  is well received with lots of mice minis. 

Other coop and competitve games would be ones with betrayers.  Dead of winter is very thematic and pretty difficult without even having a betrayer.   Other ones with different themes include battlestar Galactica and dark moon.  For bigger groups and shorter games, go for resistance/Avalon or one night games.  
Thanks, just picked up a copy!
Aww, missed it :(
That's nice, but when will Invaders from Afar be available? Most of the online places won't let you order/preorder it and my FLGS says they have no idea when it will be coming.
I used to live in Orlando and was lucky enough to go to the actual coolstuff store a lot. didn't realize it was such a big deal lol
and out again
I'm amazed the hype hasn't cooled on this one. 

It's just so dull with fake variability and almost no interaction nor tough decisions. 
It's always possible they lost the license to Battlelore, the Commands & Colors system, or they want to shift their designers over towards their new Runewars miniatures game, which takes place in the same universe.  It's also possible that the system just wasn't as lucrative as they'd hoped it would be, and they need to dump inventory that's not moving.
it's dead.

FFG has moved on to the RuneWars Miniatures game.
It's hard to say. There was talk of the game being dead for a long time before the last set of expansions were finally announced. There was really no sign of a future for the game until there was suddenly a whole wave of new stuff. You can't necessarily assume they were clearing stock in the sale. Big sales are sometime more about increasing product exposure than reducing stock. Considering they likely want to promote their own Terrinoth IP now that they've given up rights to GW's Warhammer IP, they might be trying to increase exposure of that as well. Hell if I know though.
It's a shame that it's dead, Battlelore was fun.  However no Dwarfs and no Orcs mean't I didn't pick up much beyond the core set.
Are you in the US?  Ticket to Ride is $37 on Amazon as I type this.  If you're looking for a little lower price, here are some alternatives (all prices from Amazon):

- **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** is only like $15. It's a fun, highly-streamlined interpretation of classic Werewolf.
- **Pandemic** is a superb co-op game, and Amazon has it at $23 right now.
- **Kingdom Builder** is a simple-to-pick-up, more abstract strategy game, currently at $18.
- **Dominion** is the game that put deckbuilding games on the map. The new 2nd Edition is $32.
- **Lords of Waterdeep** is a strategy game set in the D&D universe. Like Ticket to Ride, it is low on direct confrontation between players. $34.

Good luck.
Risk: Star Wars Edition might be a good choice. It's not actually Risk, it's just got the Risk name on it for name recognition.  
https://www.amazon.com/Risk-Star-Wars-Edition-Game/dp/B00SDJG59K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480461801&sr=8-1&keywords=risk+star+wars  

Great game, easy to learn and play, lots of fun.
Ticket to Ride was a really good price on Amazon yesterday, like $30 or something. You might see if there are still good sales going on. I snagged Alhambra yesterday for like $16 and Suburbia for $35.
What does he like about TTR?

The track building and secret goals? Then you could look at **Transamerica**


If you both like Arkham Horror and the only issue is the length, give Eldricht Horror a try.  Its very much the same idea but streamlined and usually only takes 1/2 the playtime or less than Arkham.

Other Co-op games that are a hit with my group:
Pathfinder Adventure Card Game
Castle Panic
Sentinels of the Miltiverse
Star Trek: Five Year Mission
Legendary: Marvel Deck Building Game


I think a large part of the genius of **Dominion** (and a big part of where other deckbuilders go wrong) is that VP cards make your deck worse. There's a real tension between making your deck better and getting points. I guess this is more of a screw the leader than help last place effect, but it does the same thing. 
One of the most elegant ones is **Suburbia**.  The higher in score a player gets the more hurdles they cross that set them back in income and reputation.  I call it elegant because it's justified thematically  - the bigger a city gets, the harder it is to maintain and keep a nice reputation.
Isle of Skye gives extra gold to players in the later rounds based on the number of players ahead of them.
**Gravwell** is an entire game built around a rubberband comeback effect.
Vast is kinda good, as it forces other players to help you out if you're going to die, since if you die someone else wins. 
**Tash-Kalar** has a catch up mechanism with the cards. Essentially if you are behind on either number of troops or types of higher leveled troops, then you can use a one time ability. It seems a little hamfisted but it works
**Isle of Skye**, **Power Grid** and **Lords of Waterdeep** were the first that came to my mind. 
I like the taxation mechanism in Belfort.
Not so much a comeback or rubber band mechanic but in Lords of Vegas there are point gates where you need to score a certain amount of points at one time in order to have them actually count. This is difficult to do as the game goes on so it prevents people from running away with the victory
**Patchwork** has one where you get to continue taking turns until your token passes the leader's token on the game's time-tracker. It's a really great mechanics that keeps things close without seeming unfair to either side.
Some cubes in Automobiles allow for this. I'm specifically thinking of the green cube that allows you to move as many gray spaces as your current position, +1 if you're the last one.
Only age 3 matters in blood rage.  You get a huge amount of points if you play it right.  Age 1 is kind of a joke. 
Urban Sprawl has a very good "smash buildings" power for the last place player than can bring them quite a bit up in the rankings rather quickly.
**Kemet** is pretty good. The person in last place determines the turn order for the next round. Turn order is really important in that game.

**Kingsburg** gives the king's favor to whoever is in last place, which gives them an extra die. It's not terribly thematic though.
Not sure if **Tokaido** qualifies, but it does have the interesting mechanic of picking who goes first each round - the player who is farthest behind on the board. May not seem like a game-changer, but sometimes getting the first move in Tokaido allows you to *completely* mess up everyone else.
**Snow Tails** if you have a balanced sled you get bonus movement equal to your current position. So third place would get to move three extra spaces.
Not necessarily "good" (and in fact not necessarily rubber band), but in **Alchemists**, if you have high enough reputation (effectively score), when you lose reputation you lose more, and if you have low enough reputation, when you lose reputation you don't lose as much. Not necessarily rubber band because having higher reputation also gives benefits, and if you can somehow avoid losing reputation at all, the penalty doesn't come into effect. But it's there and perhaps the only one with rubber band mechanic among my games.
Secret Hitler.  They games are about 30mins, its plays alot like the resistance if you have played that. Bus where resistance can be a runaway game sometimes.  Secret Hitler you can have 4-0 and it will level out to 4-4 pretty fast.
**Bloodrage** was the first game that came to my mind. Granted I have only played it once (and won) but literally every conflict/fight I had I was victorious but my opponent came out ahead in victory points. Was definitely a strange experience. 
King of Tokyo. Carcassonne if you play the long game with farmer placement and it pays off.
I'd recommend **dixit** is a great creative storytelling game.  
Codenames seems to fit the cheap and imagination part. 
I have three recommendations- 7 Wonders, the resistance and one night in Werewolf. 
There was just [This Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5e92u7/best_games_for_under_3000_2016_edition/) last week, I would look there.
I had a lot of fun playing **Say Anything** and **Telestrations** with my family last year
**Between Two Cities** is on Amazon UK for £25. Tile drafting and city building, with a semi-collaborative aspect to it. Scales well through the player count. Plays quickly to you can play a few times (sit next to different people each time).
**Bohnanza** is great game at a good price. Game is mostly about trading so it gets everyone into the action. 
Survive! Escape From Atlantis, with the 5&6 player expansion. Perfect family game.
I heard there is a good PnP 18xx game. 
Another alternative is to try some Goodwill stores, they may have some hidden gems. If you don't mind playing games with a little less polish, you could volunteer to playtest games.

Make a copy of TAK or Santorini

[Deep Future](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194986/deep-future) might work for you.
Can't Stop is an easy game to make.  Quorridor can be made easily.  If you have two sets of Looney Labs pyramids, there are a ton of great games you can play, some which require a small bit of printing - Pikemen is a great example.

I also recently saw on BGG a guide on how to play Isle of Skye with a Carcassonne set.
Dueling Nobel's is a good game that playes with a deck of cards and some six sides dice.
Having built a few PNP games myself over the years, I've found it's more a labour of love than a saver of money. Unless you work at some place where you are going to be able to get steeply discounted prices on materials, the real cost of PNP games is not nearly as attractive as it first seems it ought to be. Another consideration is that it's effectively piracy. While I'll occasionally download a car (who doesn't), I am a little more reluctant about cutting out the benefactors in a hobby run by and for hobbyists, for the most part. I have printed a few games (which were not available for purchase any longer), but I'd much rather just pay the few more bucks for the proper game now.

For someone in your position I would suggest keeping an eye on the second hand market. My local used listings (akin to craigslist) always have many pages of euro games available for sale, usually quite good prices. If you also broaden your view to keep an eye on BGG marketplace or auction listings you can find some absolute steals there.

Another thing to look into is finding some more gamers in your area with similar tastes and then start trading games within the group to let everyone try out games they don't own already.
Make a copy of TAK or Santorini

This may just be the most asked question on this sub. Many people like yourself want to share their gaming with an SO. Most of my gaming is with my wife so I understand. There are a lot of resources available to help you find something that you will both enjoy.

Your first stop should be [our guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig/two_player), and you can also try a [search](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/search?q=two+player&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all).

And I made [This Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3w97j6/recommendations_my_favorite_games_to_play_two/) about this very topic.

So many great options out there, let us know if you have specific questions.

Anyways, get **Patchwork**.
My gf loves patchwork and paperback.

Also she's been quite fond of Zooloretto lately.
Paperback and Patchwork.  Both are cheap and refreshingly different than what you are playing right now.  Easy to learn as well!  
You could try some cooperative games. I've played time stories with my gf and we had a great time. Also pandemic is a great game that doesn't have too many rules in it, but enough to have complexity. 
Patchwork is always recommended for 2 people. 

Hope that you're good at Tetris. 
Jaipur
**Patchwork** and **Carcassonne** are great 2 player games with an accessible theme.

**patchwork** and **lost cities** and **jaipur**.
My fiancée and I were recently turned on to Hive. Quick 20 minute game with some strategy and infinite replay value since the board changes every time.
Splendor 
Carcassonne 
Castles of Burgundy

(in addition to Patchwork)

Edit - forgot to mention Jaipur
**Splendor** is cheap and is good with 2 players. Easy to pick up and is a nice intro to something a little bit different than mass market games.
**Splendor** is easy to pick up, quick to play, and IMHO can be played over and over without tiring of it. It's a good competitive gateway game IMHO.
7 Wonders Duel, can't recommend enough!
Agricola - All Creatures

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119890/agricola-all-creatures-big-and-small

Exploding Kittens.

Both a hit, I both always get destroyed by her playing them. You may want to practice :)
If she crushes you at everything try **Letters from Whitechapel** and have her play the investigators.  It's damned tricky to catch Jack.  The instructions suggest to have the most experienced player play Jack but I did that with my wife and she only picked up two clues over the course of the four nights.  Needless to say I have to play the cops now and it makes for a much more tense game. 
Yeah, I see this question asked a lot too. I'm lazy, so I'm just gonna cut and paste my response to the last guy. :D

My girlfriend hated Patchwork, which seems to be a common suggestion. She does love **Star Realms**, **Carcassonne**, **Lost Cities**, **Battle Line**, and **Pandemic**
I got to play test this game last year.  Ryan is a really good guy.  
Looks interesting but I'm going to wait for retail on this one. I like the mechanic for rumbling forward though. 
Don't wait for retail on this one as its my first project, if it doesn't seriously over-fund retail may never happen.  Definitely appreciated the kind words though :)
I've played it, and it's quite enjoyable. The expansions are excellent additions too, they really mix up the formula.

I think the primary reason why it's so overlooked is that the "dungeon crawler" genre is so overcrowded at the moment. And at least personally for me I find that Imperial Assault is a notch above it, and since FFG puts out a ridiculous amount of IA content, it prevents Galaxy Defenders from getting to the table.
I think most everyone who has played it has agreed that it is a great game. The main complaint seems to be that jamming is really just an annoying mechanic, but that's about it in terms of complaints. I think it just gets overshadowed by other epic miniature games or thematic games (i.e. Star Wars).

The company put out a kickstarter last year for Swords and Sorcery which is a similar play style but in a fantasy setting. Looks like it adds a lot more complexity to the Galaxy Defenders game mechanics and I'm excited for when it arrives. It raised something like $500k.
I liked it a lot. I'm nearly done with the campaign. 

One of the other comments nailed it though. I prefer descent with the new app and there's so much content for descent now GD doesn't make it to the table. 
It is a pretty epic game system with some really detailed and fun rules and maps. Actually, it sits at the top of my favorite co-op tactical games like Gears of War and Fireteam Zero.
Fireteam zero huh is it cool r the baddies Ai controlled like.in galaxy?
My biggest complaint about the game is that it's hard to play as a co-op because quarterbacking is so easy. I think this is because they enemies are so dangerous you only have a few reasonable options to win missions. Besides that, I love it. It's my second favorite rainy-day solo game next to Ambush! Also, Sword & Sorcery should be shipping out soon-ish, so keep your eyes peeled for that!
Is it to late to back sword and sorcery I have nver backed a game on Kickstater sounds like it might be since someone said it's fixing to ship?
I love fire team zero but hate galaxy defenders. This game honestly fell flat for one primary reason: defense dice are rolled equal to the number of attack dice.

Thus no matter how many more dice it felt (keyword felt) the enemy could equally defend against it all.

I don't think it's a good game unfortunately, the mechanics are too clunky, upgrades come too randomly and sometimes you have perfect positioning and roll great attacks but because the defense has just enough dice they block it all. I would venture to say swords and sorcery will be an improvement to galaxy defenders core mechanics as they've removed the defense dice equals attack dice rolled and perhaps that will do better.
It looks fun. It's one of the few app games that i think i might want. 
Public Domain is why we have Cthulhu games up to our eyeballs. Go for it
IANAL, but as long as you're 100% *sure* that the books and characters in question are indeed public domain in your country you should be okay. Disney really screwed those laws up in the USA. 
Public domain is just that- public domain. Go for it. Make sure what you want to use *is* definitely PD, though. There are some weird spots.
Just make sure the things your using are in the public domain version.   IE  if your making something on OZ  don't use ruby slippers they were added for the movie  that's not public domain.    
Different countries have different laws on when works are considered in public domain. Just because something is public domain in the US does not mean it also public domain in Canada, for example, which could lead to problems in those territories. Talk to a real lawyer (IANAL) if you're serious, it'll be easier now than headaches down the line after you've dumped time and money into the project.
I'm not sure, but pretty sure it's okay, see Cthulhu's ubiquity.
Public Domain you can do what you want with.

BUT just because the original book is public domain doesn't mean that other material they've added to a later print is public domain: forwards, notes from the author, &c. will be covered by copyright from the moment of first publishing. To be safe you need to use an original work: you can usually find these on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page "I don't believe Steve Gutenberg had anything to do with it").
That's what the public domain is for.
Lots of cool characters are available, go for it. Cthulhu and Thor are both good, for example. If you want to make Sherlock Holmes: Revolting Detective, go crazy.
As long as all the assets (Primarily art assets) are original works and you're not sharing a stylized likeness of someone else, I think you should be fine.
Played demo game at Essen.

Artwork is nice, gameplay is very simple and inoffensive without much depth, and a deep schadenfreude when someone draws a fat chocobo so has to end their turn.

If you like Chocobos and are a FF fan then it's a relatively harmless purchase.
No but I want it even if it is terrible! Chocobo love!
I have it, if you have any rules or component questions, but since it requires 3 at minimum, I haven't had a chance to play just yet.
I played this last last night with 4 people.  The rules were short but well written and we didn't have any problems diving right in.  Each round was between 2 and 6 minutes.  The whole game ran about 20 minutes.  It supports 3-5 players but you should probably play with at least 4 players so you know all of the crystal types are in play from the beginning.  My group tends to go for co-op games this was light enough that nobody got their feelings hurt.  Don't plan an evening around it, but it's a nice filler game and the artwork is beautiful.    
What games would you use these with?
Sounds kinda like Nexus Ops?
I too am interested in seeing these (working on a thing) so if anyone knows of a link that would be swell.
This might be what you're looking for:
http://www.aplace2play.toys/c-13-space-sets.aspx
If you can trace a line from any point in your hex to any point in the target's hex without crossing a higher space in the middle, you have line of sight. You don't have to measure from corners or center points or anything like that.

The height is sometimes counterintuitive. Crossing an obstacle higher than *either end* blocks LoS. If you're on a 3-height space and the target is on a 1-height space (or vice versa), a 2-height space would block LoS.

The only other thing that can block LoS is jungle terrain, the spaces outlined in green.  
It depends. If I have to constantly consult the rulebook/search online/etc then I consider it unrefined. Games like **Arkham Horror** fit into this lots of little rules that vary based on player count (Eldritch Horror on the other hand is far improved on this topic). Games like **The Gallerist** have a million little rules but the board artwork/gameplay makes it so easy to remember that I have no qualms with it.
I'm not sure there exists a common understanding of what "refined/unrefined" means in the context of board games.  Wouldn't "refined" imply some sort of improvement upon a baseline model?

But, I would consider **Scythe** to be "refined" by comparison to its predecessor **Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia**.  But compared to something else, maybe not?  For a standalone game, I'm not sure the term would have any real meaning.
Probably looking at the difference between refined and distilled. Refined having all those little rules and distilled meaning the opposite. It's all just semantics though really.
I'm not sure I understand your specific verbiage, but I personally prefer a game with fewer rules and more strategy to one that has a hundred edge cases, phases and upkeep steps. This is what prevents me from buying Fantasy Flight games anymore.
It completely depends on the game. Ameritrash games tend to have tons of little rules added here and there for thematic reasons (we tend to call those "chrome"). Eurogames are more likely to have little niggling rules for balance as you said.

I usually like games with as few little rules exceptions as possible unless they're pretty easy to remember. **Brass** is a great game with a few little extra rules, but they're pretty thematic and they are easy to remember once you get going. **Arkham Horror**, OTOH, is just a miasma of a million different little rules. I defy anyone to get through any of their first ten games without looking stuff up. 
I'm in the process of trying to design a game, and I tried to keep the rules as simple and straight forward as possible. But this has caused some problems and edge cases to appear. Now I'm faced with a problem: keep the general rules simplicity, but add in clauses and exceptions for those edge cases, or restart and rebuild to try eliminate those edge cases. 

In the past I may have looked at games with side rules and little clauses as inconvenient, and possibly badly designed. But going through the process myself, I've come to appreciate that it's not always easy to avoid them when trying to stay true to a vision, be that thematic or mechanical. I've come to just accept them. One thing you may have noticed in the **Scythe** rulebook is the frequently overlooked rules part. If the game includes side rules, but highlights them in this way, I think all is forgiven.
IMO it depends on how intuitive the tiny rules are.  Do they make thematic sense?  Is it something you feel right doing?  Then it's refined.  If it feels like it's tacked on because it is just there for balance or something... then that's not really refined.
Either Sushi Go or Twilight Imperium.

EDIT: Fine fine, for real answers try Dixit, Mysterium, Resistance: Avalon, King of Tokyo, or buy JackBox on your computer.
Despite needing far more information to answer this question properly, I'll throw out a game that fits a wide variety of players and player counts - **Dixit**. Someone who knows nothing about games and has a hard time learning rules can jump in and enjoy themselves in a couple of minutes. And serious gamers can still enjoy it - it really works quickly and easily with all kinds of different groups.
Well, I don't know anything about your family (ages, likes/dislikes, time constraints and attention spans, disabilities?) so the best I can do is offer some general suggestions.

* **Dixit** has gone over well with my SO's family
* **Ticket to Ride** is pretty well liked too
* **6 nimmt!** plays up to 10 and is similar enough to lots of card games they might already know. 
* **Carcassonne** has yet to disappoint
Concept has been a favorite for my family at recent gatherings. Something simpler to play and explain would be codenames. With non-gaming family or guests I aim for simplicity in rules and materials and a lot of player interactivity. 
I think it's just me, but I'll make sure **12 Days** hits the table on during Christmas holidays. Just thematic reasons.

But check out [this page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig) for more ideas.
Telestrations After Dark
What's the player count? 6+ Bohnaza, Code Names, Dutch Blitz.
**One Night Ultimate Werewolf** was a huge success with the extended family during Thanksgiving. Daybreak should arrive today to add to the fun during Christmas. 
I am bringing Spyfall, Resistance, Codenames, Lanterns, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, King of Tokyo, Pandemic and Sushi Go. I will be staying with family for a week which is why the list is so long.
I'm planning to play **Small World** when I go home for Christmas. Usually I play with my wife and 6 year old son. Looking forward to playing with a larger group of people who actually strategize. Also, **One Night: Ultimate Werewolf**. Again, I usually play with my wife, 6 year old and 4 year old. I don't have a lot of opportunity to play the games I like with people outside my immediate family.
Dixit, telestrations party pack, codenames, survive escape from Atlantis, and concept are good games to go with. I'd recommend paperback if you are looking for 4 players or less.
I'm gonna pick up Pandemic Legacy and see how much you of it we can go through. 
There's a vast amount of games, styles, time ranges and players counts... you're going to need to be more specific. 
Rulebooks tell you what to replace with what.

From my point of view, HQ adds minor fixes that really improve the game whereas Recon is more typical deckbuilder expansion of "more and different everything". I view HQ almost as a necessity and Recon is cool enough if you're into that sort of thing. They work well together. If you're digging around and manage to find an old version of the game without any expansions I'd pass, as HQ really helps it.

If you're getting it retail odds are at least HQ is included, most likely HQ and Recon.
My favorite 2P games are **Targi**, **Patchwork**, and **7 Wonders Duel**.
Welcome to the wonderful world of modern board gaming!


Since you're relatively new to the hobby, below are a few recommendations that are the "classic" (or at least modern classic) 2-player recommendations that will ensure you both have a ton of fun without overwhelming you.


• **Jaipur** - A fantastic card game that has you and your opponent trying to make smart trades to create efficient "sets" of commodities that can then be sold for a premium. Great fun and a modern classic!


• **Hive** - Two-player games tend to veer towards the "abstract" end of the spectrum (i.e.: without much of a theme), and this game stands tall among the others in the genre. A lot of people refer to it as "insect chess", but don't let that scare you away. This is a fantastic strategic tile laying game that is well-regarded by many gamers.


• **Pandemic** - It isn't two player only (plays up to 4), but is the quintessential "cooperative" game. You think competing is fun? Try working together to rid the world of nasty diseases.


• **Battle Line** - Simple, yet deeply strategic. This is one of the greatest two-player games ever made by one of the greatest board game designers - Reiner Knizia. You are competing with your opponent to make poker-like sets of cards to claim flags on the battle line. So elegant and so good.


Hope that helps. Let us know what you finally decided to play/buy and how you enjoyed the games. Have fun!
Check out the WSIG section of the wiki. It has an entire section on 2-player games.

Knowing nothing else about your tastes, I'd suggest **Jaipur**, **Patchwork**, **Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small**, **Pandemic**, and **Dominion**.
So mant choices of amazing 2 player games! Here's a few of my fav
 Onitama or The Duke are good chess like games.  Armada is good if you like fighting with ships (although can be fiddly). Jaipur is a great card game that plays in less than 20 minutes.  
My SO and I play all our games just the 2 of us. Some of our favourites are:

Shorter games: Hanabi, Star Realms, Flash Point Fire Rescue, Sushi Go, DungeonQuest

Mid length games: Arkham Horror LCG, Pandemic, Galaxy Trucker

Longer games: Forbidden Stars, Eldritch Horror, Merchants and Marauders, Descent, Arkham Horror, Tales of Arabian Knights, Dead of Winter
**Forbidden Island**
**Forbidden Desert**
**Mice & Mystics**
**Letters from WhiteChapel**
**Flashpoint**
**Legendary Marvel**

The answer to this question is always **Patchwork**. (And, boy, does it get asked a lot.)
Seems pretty similar to **The Downfall of Pompeii,** but without the movement.
It *looks* like a very abstract game..
wow the voice over on that video was infuriating, couldn't even listen the whole way through
https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig
I'll recommend a couple in different genres:

Party game: **Codenames** and **Deep Sea Adventure**

Bluffing: **Sheriff of Nottingham,** **Coup,** and **The Resistance: Avalon**

Strategy: **Castles of Burgundy** and **7 Wonders**

All of these are easy to learn and won't cost you more than 25 bucks or so.

Happy gaming!
>Would all the players do the same thing; buy low, get contracts, sell high, get end game bonuses?

I've only play the Gallerist 5 times... but the game is more tactical than strategic. Yes, in a broad sense, you want to buy low and sell high. But a **huge** part of the game is the entire kickback action mechanic; essentially, you are always looking for ways to take advantage of kickback actions and to deny your opponents those opportunities. If you do this efficiently, you will essentially have more actions than your opponent and will do **much** better.

But these decisions are far from easy and is what makes the game so attractive. Furthermore, these decisions are very situational. Sometimes taking a kickback action is cost-prohibited and other times not giving your opponent a kickback action will be a huge hindrance to yourself. And as you can imagine, this encourages players to focus on each other... which makes it feel more interactive than your typical euro. 

Another thing that should be mentioned is that game-length can be manipulated by players and this has a profound effect. So thoughtful players will speed/slow the pace of the game (and intermittent scoring... which can inject a bunch of cash/influence into the game) in order to hurt their opponents. It's a bit difficult to describe how influential this can be... but trust me... it's important.

Lastly, the end-game bonuses will give you cash/influence/etc. These aren't insignificant at all... generally, there is a fairly strong race element to obtain them. And of course, players need to balance obtaining those at the expense of not obtaining something else sooner. 

In the end, the game does have a euro/victory-point-salad feel. But obtaining those VP efficiently **is** the puzzle/game and highly variable depending on players actions. If you like heavier euros, I think you will like this. 

Plus, if someone breaks into your house you can use the box as a weapon. It's big/heavy =)





EDIT: I noticed you have an "orleans" tag near your name. Oddly enough, I also played that 5 times. Now, I know it's probably not the best idea to compare these two euros (they are quite different). But for me, the wow factor with Orleans has dropped some. I still rate them similarly... but I find Orleans to be less interactive and one of those games where you can do your own thing, with a modest consideration about other players. In the gallerist, you **need** to focus on what other players are doing to play efficiently. It definitely seems like the deeper game.

That being said, Orleans is a wonderful game that is just easy to play. So, if I've been working all day and just want to play something quick... I would probably play Orleans before the Gallerist. But if I had the weekend off and wanted something to really think about it... Gallerist would be my pick. 
As you've said, the general flow of the game is buy low, sell high, use tickets, send assistants, win auction, complete objectives. The replayability comes from tactical decisions and reading into your opponent's agenda.

Examples of decisions you will be facing:

* I've bought this painting at $5, do I sell it now at $11 to get the cash in order to hire more assistants, or do I push its value up to $20?
* Opponent X is certainly going to promote the photographer soon, should I grab one of the artwork to piggy back, or use that action space now for a potential bonus action?

In essence, there won't be a lot of different strategies, as it's a tactical game (plan 2-3 turns ahead) with an initial nudge towards certain directions.
Guess I should grab the only copy at my flgs while I can. Its kinda rough paying $70 for one game though.
My ONLY worry with Inis is the review of All The Games You Like Are Bad. Why? Well, primarily because he makes some really sharp observations about the game that might be worth taking into account.

Granted, same arguments might apply to Blood Rage.

I also have Inis on my shelf, had to order it from United States since European deliveries got delayed until next year. I hope to play it soon, but overall I do adore the theme and mechanisms seem like a good bundle of new takes on known mechanisms.

BUT! **I don't think Inish is deeper than Blood Rage!** Blood Rage has a multilayered faction development which enhances cards and other mechanisms and plays a key role in the game. There is nothing like that in Inis (though I assume there will be once it will have an inevitable expansion like other Matagot area-control games).
How is this with 2 ? I play Blood Rage with 2 regularly and we enjoy it a ton. Im looking for something similar but not complicated. 
**Personally, I like Blood Rage over Inis**, but that may have to do with the kind of players that you play with.

You can argue that Inis is deeper or heavier than Blood Rage. But the games arent even that similar to begin with, the only comparison being that its a "dudes on a board** type of game.

Blood Rage focuses alot on conflict between other players, and the whole game is centered on how you choose your fights, making it an excellent combat game with players who like confrontation. Victory in Blood Rage is by points on combat, while Inis is about who has the most objectives finished, making it seem like a euro race, Combat doesnt occur much in Inis either. 

While some would not want to put a substantial amount of time into learning card synergies and draft options, Blood Rage truly shines after multiple plays with the same group of people. When everyone knows how they want to build their clans and the kinds of card drafting they want or is available to them, you'll see that there's plenty of depth and replay ability to the board.

F#$% the KS exclusives and the imbalance they bring to the board though. No defending that, its better to play without them.
I would love inis if not for the fact that the game takes too long for my group. but for those who don't mind the extra duration i think it's a solid buy.
:) when you say that Inis is heavier and deeper than Blood rage, is it also more difficult to teach to new gamers?
Been thinking about selling Blood Rage, despite not having played it a lot yet. I feel like between Kemet, Inis and possibly Rising Sun, there won't be space for it in my "board game Valhalla" as SU&SD put it. 
Attritional combat alone makes me totally uninterested in this game.

The awful, awful, awful tile design is bad too (why on earth would someone design terrain so that the art has horizon lines that will be all over the place?), but the antiquated combat is even worse.
But-but Blood Rage has some really cool minis! 
Ah, dice towers.  So many gamers own them and so few of those owners use them. :/
I'm wondering if larger dice like in King of Tokyo will fit inside.
That's pretty neat, wish I could weld
He built it in a *cave!* With a *box of scraps!!*

Seriously, looks nice dude, gj.
That's really cool. I like how casually you just threw it together from scrap, like it was nothing. Excellent work.
This is awesome! For some reason I originally read the title as "scraps from my GARBAGE" and thought of wilted cabbage and chicken bones, so your end result was quite the surprise :)
How heavy is it?
Check out Skulls. Easy to teach, learn and can be handmade without any large time devoted to making it.
**Cockroach Poker** has been my go-to game. Easy to teach, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't feel too bad when you lose, and there are fun moments when *everyone at the table but you* knows what the card is.

I love **Coup**, but **Cockroach Poker** replaced it as our bluffing gateway game.

**Love Letter** is less a bluffing game, and more about figuring out what cards the other players have (by process of elimination). It's still a fun game, but maybe that's not quite what you have in mind.

Finally, a game that *only* works with three players is **Win, Lose, Banana**. It's silly. You can make your own deck by writing those words on three coasters at a bar.
**Secret Hitler** and **Don't Get Eated** are delicious bluffing games with good PnP files. I especially recommend the latter.
Try **Spyfall**. Everybody (except one-- the spy) is given a card with the same exact location (e.g. airplane, cruise ship, zoo, business party). You take turns asking each other questions in order to find out the one person who has no idea where you guys are and is just trying to BS his way through it. The catch is, nobody wants to be too obvious with their answers or questions because if the spy guesses where you are, he wins.

[You can even try it free online if everyone has their own smart phone.](http://spyfall.adrianocola.com/)
It would be trivial to make your own version of The Resistance, and that would be my recommendation.

Coup is great too, though.
Coup is fantastic and around $10. The G54 edition adds a ton of variety and runs about $25
Coup is great. Citadels is also a great option. Also I would recommend considering Love Letter.
Plenty of good suggestions here (especially The Resistance and Skulls since they're *easily* played with a deck of cards), so I thought I'd throw in **Liar's Dice**, which just requires you to scrounge up 5 dice per player. You don't even need cups, really.
Secret Hitler works well at 5/6. It's print and play AFAIK (at least the copy I played was printed) 
**The Resistance** is a good suggestion. I would also add **Sheriff of Nottingham** It's a good bluffing card game.
Secret Hitler.

Light on rules, 15-20 minute game.
**Two Rooms and a Boom**.  You do need at least 6, but you can Print and Play.
Hey there, I honestly think we should get medals for pursuing this hobby in India! 

So after scouring through my options online, I chanced upon 365games which is UK based. Just last month they've upped their shipping charges from 0.99GBP to 2.99GBP per item, which is actually not too bad given it's still sub Rs.300 for delivery. Having said that, the game prices themselves aren't comparable to the miniaturemarkets and coolstuffincs which are way cheaper. BUT it still works out cheaper than our domestic alternatives... so hurrah!

They have a sister storefront ozgamesshop which usually stocks the same games at marginally higher prices. But the site comes with free international shipping for large orders. Have a look.
You don't have too many options, /u/heartht. There's www.blahgames.com, although they're quite expensive, and www.amazon.in which isn't much cheaper (that said, they do occasionally have sales and sometimes their prices aren't too unreasonable). That's it, as far as I know.

Some stores do stock boardgames, though - for example, Starmark in Chennai has a selection (not cheap!).
I agree that it's a great game! For what it's worth, although their communication isn't good, they care about their product and take time to developer something that integrates really well with the established line. It's what has led to delays, but I'd rather see delays for a fully realized project.
This is the best thing ever. Lovecraft games always lack that special "go insane thinking about the vast horror of the cosmos" ingredient that is the core idea of everything Lovecraft ever wrote (other than, you know, implicit racism). 

Except here's a card that you choose to put in your deck that does nothing! Or does it?

I seriously hope they string us along and never do anything with this card and its campaign book entry. Because that would be so perfectly Lovecraftian. 
If this "solution" becomes important later in the cycle it could be amazing!

Dont give ffg articles too much credit, going by past games articles 
One note: my group hates the whole "Crossroads/Resolve the Trial" portion of the Exodus expansion, and we never use that module. The idea that someone could go through the whole 4+ hour game only to get completely eliminated at the climax ... that's just unforgivable from a design standpoint, IMO. 

We still use the Ally cards anyway, just to add some flavor and interesting decisions. 
Ionian nebula and allies are the only parts of Exodus that I no longer use ever. The ionian nebula can eliminate a player at the very end of the game and that juat sucks. The allies basically turned into hazard zones. Players never wanted to go there because something bad could happen and it wasn't worth the coin toss. 

I like final five and personal goals because they give humans a reason to hide which makes finding the real cylons harder.
Despite the shit /u/drakkos has taken for them, their [accessibility teardowns](http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/on-accessibility-tear-downs/#.WDzEJX1gE6s) are great ([Splendor](http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/splendor-2014-accessibility-teardown/#.WDzEs31gE6s) for example) and have spread awareness of accessibility issues for all kinds of people among consumers, designers, and publishers.
Cataract surgery for even one eye is both relatively minor, and incredibly life changing.

As we age however, we all get farsighted. They probably suffer from far-sightedness. Games are at a poor length for vision, too far for reading glasses, too close for normal far-sighted vision.
In my experience a lot of the difficulty distinguishing pieces is alleviated through exposure. As someone plays the game they essentially train themselves to be better at telling pieces apart.

Given that your parents are sharp and haven't had that much exposure to the games, I am reticent to say that this isn't the case for them as well.
Thanks for the breakdown!  This one has been on my radar for a while but I've been unimpressed by other co-op deckbuilders I've tried (Xenoshyft, Shadowrift, Legendary) so I was talking myself out of it despite the overwhelmingly positive preliminary reviews.  This has rekindled my interest!
Received this a couple days ago and got a 2 player game in this weekend. My wife and I really liked it. While not groundbreaking it takes all the best elements from other deck builders and co-op deck builders and adds just enough tweaks. The fact that you have to ready a spell a turn before you cast it along with the random turn order adds enough strategy to make this game fresh. This leads to some tense push-your-luck choices where you may want to take a few risks hoping you get your turns in before the big bad. 

I am not sure if this will win over people that do not like the genre, but there is enough new here to bring people who might have some fatigue for the genre back to the table. This is probably 2nd to only Blood Rage as my favorite game I have backed on KS
How would you compare it to the other 2 new deckbuilding games of 2016, Clank and Tyrants of the Underdark? 
Are the components as terrible as many people have mentioned?
I listened to a recent Shut Up & Sit Down podcast and Quinns said it was great but the experience was marred by really bad production quality. Any thoughts on that?
Im so pumped for this game! I think it might be at the top of my list. 

I also want to grab The big book of madness. 

I love star realms and I love coop games. Can not wait to play these! 

I might ask for them for Christmas.  
I was getting interested in this game, but then I saw that there is backer exclusive content. The greatly reduced my desire to give them my money for an inferior version.

Also, could someone who followed the Kickstarter tell me, the site is worded as if the decision to not include stretch goals in retail versions was made after the fact, rather than planned from the beginning? I want to check if this is the case, because if so this is even scummier, but I want to get the facts before fully judging. 
I'd love for my KS copy to ship at some point soon. Everyone else seems to be getting their copies and mine hasn't even left the warehouse yet. 
Still eagerly waiting for my KS to come in. Hopefully this week.

I'm a little worried about the comparisons to **Sentinels of the Multiverse** since that game didn't impress me much, but I'm optimistic the deckbuilder mechanisms of this game will make it better.
Not heard many people discuss this one even with some positive reviews from the big reviewers.
The more I think about game design, and putting my brain into that zone, the more I get moments where I think "I *thought* of that!"

>Your deck is never shuffled. If you draw your last card, you flip your discard over, done.

Fair play, Action Phase Games. You took the idea and made it work. Hope to try this soon.
December is set to be a good month for deck builders at my house, I should be receiving this and Xenoshyft Dreadmire, then sometime later (hopefully not too much later) Heart of Crown.
Thanks for the write up, looking forward to it even more now
I think this game sounds great and have loosely followed it. I recently played the **Harry Potter Coop Deck Builder** and really enjoyed it despite never seeing HP.

I was looking to add **Marvel Legendary** as my coop deck builder this holiday, but should I wait for this game instead? I'm a huge Marvel fan and there are expansions up the wazoo for every character which is great, but if that game lacks in certain areas and **Aeon's End** excels, I'd rather pick that up.

Thoughts?
Glad to hear you like it. I should  be getting my copy in the next day or 2 here. I don't own any deck building games yet. Glad to hear this pulls the best aspects of a lot of games and ties them into one.
Good to see some love for Aeons End!

The artwork wasn't as bad as I heard and really looked much better once I got my hands on the cards.

There is a massive amount of content in that box too! Can't wait to play my first game soon! 

My only gripe so far is that the "insert" is terrible.
Just got my copy and I must say, this game is awesome!

I typically hate co-op games and could not think that co-op deckbuilders would be a good genre but this has convinced me otherwise.  Fun and CHALLENGING game!
Between **Foe Hunters** and **Hero Realms**, I have my share of co-op deck builders for the time being. Also, watching Rhado's run through during the campaign did not really inspire me to back it.

One of my friends did, so I will get a chance to try it when I next see him.
I have one big problem with Co-op Deckbuilders that just bothers me to no end typically. 

Your next move is usually obvious, and everyone rarely needs to interact with each other. More often everyone is just individually contributing to the same goal. 

Is this game similar in that regard? Or are there tough decisions and  roles that need to be filled by the team?
A bunch of Kickstarter exclusives including two Nemesises (sp?) are keeping me from impulse buying the game. I've played it (shortly) at Spiel but I feel I miss out on the complete experience by purchasing it at retail. 
I've only played it 3 or 4 times but have really enjoyed it every time, it takes very little explaining or set up so its a really easy one to pull out and always produces a few laughs from our group. Always ends in a bit of chaos.  
I love the programming under pressure style of play, and the last minute panic action dropping always seem to create some fun situations. I know quite a lot of people don't seem to like it. but I have fun, then again maybe that's because I seem to be quite good at it (I've won every game so far).  
I didn't realise there were different versions though, are the contents much different?
It's fun.

I like it as a semi-drunken free for all, not as a "oh man, let's all sit here quietly and think out what to do." Just letting things go fast and furious is my preferred way of playing. Busting out the sand timer and then making good-natured jabs at anyone who is getting flustered as they try to figure out what to play.

I'll always have a soft spot for RoboRally. It's a game I was introduced to maybe 15 years or so ago. Way before I got into board gaming as a hobby. 

I don't think there's that much difference between the versions. The newer ones have a board that's a starting area for players. Originally we used to just start at the first checkpoint. The starting area board makes things a little bit simpler. Since if everyone starts at the first checkpoint, all the robots have to start virtual. Which is something you don't have to deal with, and explain, that often otherwise. 

The one I have also came with a sand timer, the official rule, if I remember correctly, is that the first person to finish programming their turn, starts the timer. If someone doesn't finish programming their turn before the timer runs out, then their unfinished moves are drawn randomly from the cards they have left.

I usually play without the timer. If people take way too long on their turns, and they've played before, I can see using it though.

I like the programming aspect of it a lot. It's also more fun with more players, since you get in each other's way. The priorities of your cards can become important if you want to mess with someone, or avoid someone. Some people find this side of it frustrating. 

It does suffer a bit from a runaway leader. Especially if one person is way ahead, and everyone else is in each other's way. I've seen a good suggestion on bgg to help mitigate this. You place a die on each checkpoint with a number face up, eg 4. Every time the die is shot with a robot's laser, you turn the die to subtract 1 from it. Once it reaches 0, the die is removed and the checkpoint is accessible. Until then, the die is like a wall. I haven't actually tried playing with this rule, since unfortunately RoboRally doesn't get a lot of play in my group. 

If you're interested in programmable movement, you'll probably like RoboRally. Like I said though, unfortunately I don't get to play mine much as not everyone seems to like it.

I think this game is really long for what it is. I've not tried the new version, but in the old version you'd get a run away leader, especially if there was a player who does programming for a living. 

The timer is super essential. Some people take *for ever* making their moves. The cards in the old version were mostly useless (the power up cards)
A ~~possibly unpopular~~ still quite lengthy counterpoint incoming: I didn't enjoy **Secret Hitler** nearly as much as other secret role games and I've been on winning and losing teams. And that's because I think it's a "social deduction" game with no actual "deduction."

For me, it's all about the random policy deck which ultimately determines who wins. For those who haven't played before, the table elects two people who then pull three "fascist" or "liberal" policies from a random pile and then choose from those. Since the deck is random and contains more bad policies than good ones, it's entirely possible that two good players might pull three bad policies and be forced to pass a bad one.

Of course, there's no reason for bad guys to ever claim anything *other* than just being screwed by the deck. Passing a good guy bad tiles and then lying about what they pulled only puts immediate suspicion on yourself, whereas simply lying about what you got can be sustained for round after round until enough people make the same claim that the table gets suspicious of everyone.

And since the deck's results are unreliable information, *literally everything* you see from the results of an election is also unreliable. Mechanically, whether a policy is good or bad means nothing, since two good players could have been screwed and two bad players could just lie. There's no clear way to tell what actually happened with policy tiles.

What that leaves then is simple lying. The bad guys will lie, predictably, that they got screwed by the deck and the good guys will start accusing each other of lying. But there's nothing to base those accusations on besides a hunch, and it leads to the loudest players dominating the conversation. 

Worst of all, the "Hitler" win condition is even more impossible to figure out from a good guy perspective and even more boring to play as Hitler himself. You would think being the secret bad guy who has to get the others to trust him/her would be a fun role to play, but it's not. The optimal Hitler play is to just be a good guy as much as possible. There's no strategy to it. You could try to save your fascist friends if they're being accused, but it does you no good. Again, it only draws suspicion to you, and your role is to lay low.

Example: I had a game of Secret Hitler once when I was Hitler. We spent 20 minutes debating whether or not to put me on a mission and all I did was say "Eh, if you want to great. If not, that other guy is a good choice." I listened quietly as my fellow evil people talked the rest of the table into electing me. And when the game ended the bad guys rejoiced and the good guys congratulated me for the great bluff. But I didn't do anything. My role was entirely passive. 

By basically backing off the game's discussion I made it far more difficult for the good guys to see if I was lying or not. Had I talked, they could have figured out if I was lying. But how you do test someone when they shrug and say "you decide"? Sure you could get suspicious of someone who doesn't talk, but when there's all this information flying around the room about good and bad policies and who elected whom, that fades to the background. When a game's best strategy can be "refuse to talk," that's not sharp design.

I've played games where I got dealt bad cards as a good guy and was ignored for the next half hour. I've played games where the bad guys drew only good tiles and lost. I've played games where some players at the table never even touched a card. I've played games where I've turned to the guy next to me who is also good and said "I know it's X and Y, but there's no way to prove it because of the deck."

At the end of the day, the core mechanic of Secret Hitler just becomes "Can you tell if you friend is lying?" With **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** or **The Resistance**, bluffing is a part of the game too, but there's enough solid information in the game to suss out who might be telling the truth. In **The Resistance** you have a board that will give you 100 percent accurate information about who voted which way. With **One Night**, you have the same bluffing as **Secret Hitler**, but it's boiled down to a five minute game where the way cards interact can give you real information or at the very least set up conflicts between two players' stories.

For a game that's 30 to 45 minutes and has all the bells and whistles but no real backbone, **Secret Hitler** is just too long for an ultimately simple mechanic. If you want a great bluffing experience that's easy to teach, **Skull** plays twice as quick, is twice as simple, none of it is due to luck and it tests people's lying abilities just as much. 

I don't hate people who love this game. You're entitled to love it! The components are absolutely GORGEOUS. But I've seen a lot of hype surrounding this game, especially at my local game night. I've seen people explain it as "The Resistance for people who don't like to lie" which couldn't be further from accurate. In some ways I think newcomers may be setting themselves up for frustration or disappointment if the luck of the policy deck doesn't go their way. Just temper your expectations.



Played this with different groups and different amount of people. It works well with all amount but I like how it's different depending on the amount.

Also like that you can find your own style that fits with your personality, or not.

My best win was when I was Hitler and my liberal friend was 100% convinced I was a liberal. And when he made me chancellor and we won the game he was disillusioned for a minute. 

Nothing to lose friendships over though.
I've played maybe a dozen games, and I really want to like it (those production values!). I haven't written it off yet, but we have yet to see the fascists win. We are a group of players that have played Avalon literally hundreds of time, so we're very experienced with social deduction, and we're also mostly engineers so we can solve puzzles. There have been a couple of games where it's been close but no cigar. I'm not ready to say we're too good to lose, but I'm more willing to say that something about our metagame heavily favors liberals even if I'm not sure what it is. Anyone else having this experience? 
if only itd you know...show up at my house?
Must be nice to have the game yet! Im still waiting for wave two.
I prefer this to The Resistance. It's easier to teach and slightly more forgiving in regards to lying.

I powered out of a 5 player game where my Hitler was immediately outed as a fascist. That just isn't possible with The Resistance.

It's in my top 10
Secret Hitler is a great game, but has a couple of fatal flaws. There isn't a lot of concrete information, so the game devolves into pointless arguing that drags things out. To make matters worse, you can get eliminated, and have to wait 10+ minutes for the game to end. Finally, the game is imbalanced, as the Liberals can steamroll the game by getting lucky with a good team early game.


I'm part of an 80+ person Meetup, and we have multiple tables of **Resistance: Avalon** every night, but no **Secret Hitler**.
My wife almost divorced me because of this game* because of how well I was able to lie to her to convince her I wasnt Hitler, and she made me Chancellor and the fascists won.

^(*not really)
You can easily play this with a pack of cards  (red for liberal/yes votes. Face cards for roles). I feel it's best with 7+ players personally. 
Our group of Masters students has played a horrifying amount of Secret Hitler across several field excursions and it is easily the favourite (with Codenames a close second). Maybe we're just terrible people.
I also like it a lot. It has almost the perfect balance between information you get from gameplay and people (obviously they can lie). Its not like you make your decision purely on who you think tells the truth or is more convincing.
It is only now after reading your post that I realized I never got my copy. Looks like I forgot to confirm the order details when they sent the follow-up email.

I hope I can still get it. :/
Wish I could actually buy this game.
Haven't played a ton of Secret Hitler (I have the PoD version), so I can't quite tell whether I like it more or less than The Resistance: Avalon. I don't think I have a huge preference one way or another. I would probably say having both around can be nice for variety's sake. Thematically it's fun to be able to accuse people of being "literally Hitler" in Secret Hitler, too.
A colon in your title would sure make things a lot less comfortable.
My group just played this for the first time yesterday afternoon. It was really well received. We have done Avalon and One Night Ultimate Werewolf, so there had been some secret role familiarity in our group. But, this game was more well received by everyone at the table than the other games. It also seemed to move much more quickly. Two thumbs up after one play through. 
I played this the weekend before Thanksgiving for the first time.  Twice I played with the full 10 people, and three times with a group of 8.  Good fun at both group sizes.  The fascists only won once; they managed to get the assassinate power both times, leaving the liberals outnumbered for the last round or two. The liberals won once by getting lucky with the first assassinate and killing Hitler.  The rest of the games the liberals won by passing enough policies.  Twice it was pretty lopsided (only three or four fascist ones passed), but once both teams were within on policy of winning, there was a fascist chancellor, and the president pulled both remaining liberal policies from the deck.  

There's just enough strategy to it to make it pretty interesting, while being just light enough to enjoy this while tipsy without screwing things up for your teammates.  It'll see a lot of play from my groups in the future.
I enjoyed this quite a bit, but the game (in my group at least) heavily favored liberals. Unless fascists were very sly with their words it was a runaway victory for liberals, and the people who talked the most were almost always fascists.
Another thing, download the app if you want to play this. It alleviates all players from the task of moderator so they can just concentrate on their role. It also sets the tone a bit.
Where can I get this game? Anyone know the cost or release? 
We played a lot of Avalon before this and were very excited about Secret Hitler but it fell flat for us. IMO there are too many fascist cards in the deck. The game is about deduction but you know for a fact that someone likely did pull 3 fascist cards once or even twice in the game. Maybe we missed something but as a gaming group who like skill, this killed it for us.
I love this game.  Simple to learn, easy to play.  
We played three games recently at a game night: Two with 10 people, one with 9. 

* Our first game (ever) ended up being a runaway Fascist win via six policies -- I think this was mostly because people were still figuring out the strategy as I believe hardly anyone voted against any chancellor nominees. 
* Our second game was again won by the Fascists, as the Secret Hitler (whom was actually the same Hitler as the first game) did an excellent job of acting liberal. He actually got nominated by a Liberal president immediately after the third Fascist policy had been enacted.
* Our third game was won by the Liberals. This game was more difficult to track down the Fascists, however, the Liberals knew of two probable Fascists -- one of which was Hitler who was killed with the first assassination.

I absolutely love the mechanic that you need to be extremely careful about chancellor elections after the third Fascist policy. It definitely amps up the discussions right around the time that you have enough information to start judging who is Fascist.

Overall most people loved the game and were excited to start a new round after the prior one finished. It seems pretty well balanced, but you definitely need people that are willing to talk and question decisions in order for your team to win. I think it's more approachable than similar games in the genre, both because lying in this particular game seems easier (not sure why), but also because people are familiar with the theme. I expect it to be a popular party game in our house for a long time.
This is almost EXACTLY what happened to me (although I finally got to play with a group a few weeks prior). My poor wife knew that I was ready to jump on the first group of five+ that came over. We finally had willing (but skeptical) opponents on Thanksgiving, and it was an enormous hit. They wanted to keep playing. My wife is. Or a gamer, but the next morning, out of nowhere, she said, "I wish you didn't need five to play Secret Hitler."
I love that these guys simply decided to pretend that Robert Anton Wilson and SJG's **Illuminati** didn't exist.
One game that looks interesting is [Cryptic Explorers](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tempesttome/cryptic-explorers-tabletop-tactics-in-the-realms-o). It's a 1 vs many asymmetric dungeon crawl that appears to offer a lot more variability than most of the dungeon crawlers on the shelves today. It's got some really awesome art and a concept that's common on the surface, but unique in its implementation of them (Basically some old god with some unique powers bent on destroying some people).

There are several reasons that the campaign isn't doing too well: They stacked up with some heavy hitters (KD:M 1.5 and Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden City), they aren't in on the miniature game which isn't in itself a negative but it alienates a large portion of the Kickstarter boardgame funding crowd who "do it for the sweet minis", and they're missing reviews from some bigger names, they're a very small company with little to no pushing power and their inexperience in the industry pushes some away. Any of these things wouldn't be terrible, but I think the combination of them really slowed their progress to the crawl which ends in their unsuccessful campaign.


It's too bad. I really liked the idea of the highly variable party and gods as well as the art.
 Looks like they need to get to advertising. Sometimes just beign on kickstarter isn't enough and you have to do some heavy facebook/twitter/reddit/tumblr campaigning. I honestly don't even remember seeing this game and I hit kickstarter every few days and sort by newest start for tabletop games. That being said, I don't actually click on each one as I very much judge a book by its cover and if it doesn't scream out to me when I'm browsing it doesn't get my attention.
The rulebook for this gave me cancer it sucked so hard. I hope no one gives them money to encourage such shitty work. 
There's a whole lot wrong with that game. $75AUD is an *insane* price for a card game. Also, their funding goal is $75,000? That's double what Stonemaier Games needed for **Scythe**'s funding goal. 

Lisboa, on KS now, had a lower funding goal too. This is ridiculous. 
I don't think the art style is helping things either.

People really hate munchkin and art like that legitimately gives them PTSD. 
Ascension is an enjoyable deckbuilder and it's got about 10 different "expansions".
Ascension. The fact that the row of cards available to acquire changes constantly means that games can play out very differently, even with just one set. And since there are 10 sets, all of which can be played separately or combined in different ways, you get a lot of different interactions available.
I'd recommend getting a few cheaper deck builders (which have also proved to be my favorites in the genre):

Star Realms

Paperback

The Valley of Kings
In terms of bang for buck **Star Realms** has the most plays by far of any deckbuilder I own...and I own a lot of 'em.  I'm not even counting app plays XD
I would probably say either Legendary Encounters: Alien or Tyrants of the Underdark. 

I'm leaning more towards Tyrants because you also have a board that you have to worry about, as well as the cards, which makes you try to balance the two things to capitalize on points. 
I'd recommend **Trains** and **tyrants from the underdark** as they both feature a board to work around and mix things up more. Tyrants is a longer game and it has the rotating market where you have to play even more tactically. Trains has the fixed market, and plays a bit quicker. Both are solid deck builders with different strategies to explore and plenty of card variety.
Another vote for the **Ascension** series here.
Just since it hasn't been mentioned I'll toss in **Thunderstone Advance** (or Thunderstone Numenera)
I feel like **Shadowrun: Crossfire** may be the answer here.  Considering there are missions that come with the game that require that you have logged at least 75 games among your group.  The expansion does help to give a bit more mission variety for lower level players.
**Legendary Marvel** + **Dark City Expansion**
Mage knight

What specifically did you dislike about it?
I don't own it but I played with a mate who has it. I enjoyed the first 30 mins or so, but I found the stories a little long and by the end of each one I was over it. I only played three stories though so not sure if they get better as it goes on.
It fell flat with us too. Missions should've been split in smaller bits.
We also forgot or never cared to spend time to Search for items though; they probably would've made the gameplay richer.
This was my experience too. I got 2 full-hearted attempts in and it just didn't work for the group. I got hooked when I saw Wil Wheaton play the game with his family on Tabletop and saw so many people saying "It's an elegantly simple RPG for everyone!"

Turns out that it's actually a very complicated RPG that requires a lot of pre-planning and some downtime as you come across special encounters. It's definitely a game I would play a couple of times with an experienced group before diving into.
I agree, didn't go over well with me or my nieces. Played once, sold it.
It's an extremely light game where the dice rolls heavily weigh on what you can accomplish. If you're not in it purely for the story it's not going to get any better. 
I played this one at a convention a few years ago, and it didn't excite me either. You're not alone. Felt too long, relied too much on dice rolls, and had too many fiddly bits for my liking. Cute theme though.
Same thing happened to me. Thought I would love it. Turned out to be a real boring slog.
A game with a great aesthetic, but clunky design. We tried Runebound and Legends of Andor after being disappointed in Mice and Mystics and found them both to be much, much better.
MaM is more of a storytelling for young ones than a full grown dungeon crawler. If you expected a new Descent or DnD I could understand any dissapointment. I bought it as a light dungeoncrawler to play with my nephes and we had a blast.  

The game is actually really nice, just a litle easy mechnics-wise. Still I like and enjoy it for what it is.
There is a good chance you will be as disappointed, if not more, after playing more. You would expect to find more interesting events/mechanics but the following scenarios hardly offer anything new. For me the most disappointing thing was that *everything* in the game is solved by rolling dice and you just keep following what happens almost if it was an automated story disguised as a board game. The character progression isn't very interesting and at least I felt the story was a bit too childish to draw me in.

M&M works for people who aren't into heavier games or are new to hobby board games. If you have any experience of more complex games or heavier dungeon crawlers / adventure games, you'll be almost guaranteed to get disappointed with M&M.

There's also a chance that you just had too high expectation for the game and will enjoy it more now that you know how it plays.
I dont know if this helps you or anyone, but here it is being played by wil wheaton and his family on tabletop:

Are the chapters replayable, or is it similar to Andor?
Well If you want to get rid of it, PM me
Sorry it didnt work out for your group. A few complaints about it is you are rolling a ton for almost everything. If you do not enjoy thta being the main action then you might not enjoy this game.

Maybe check out /r/boardgameexchange?
Mice & Mystics is best played with gamers fresh into the hobby that like simplicity but with a good amount of theme. My only negative about the game is the rules. There are quite a few fiddly rules that are mixed between the campaign book and the rulebook. This causes downtime in between the game and people hate downtime, especially when its a dice chucker. I think it's good enough to keep until my kid is of age to play but I likely wont whip it out for another game night with friends.
The rules get much easier to understand as time goes on.

But if it fell flat on the first chapter, honestly, it's unlikely to get better. My daughter LOVES this game (we just bought the expansion) but it's very light for my SO and I so we lean heavily on the role-playing aspect.

You have it, so might as well try a few chapters. Maybe role-playing will fill that gap for you.
Are you a single digit in age?  Because that's what you need to be.

This game is for families with children.  
Maybe Dungeons & Dragons The Fantasy Adventure Boardgame
I want to say **HeroQuest**, except for the red dots? How long ago was this?
Descent maybe?
I saw somebody else post recently about picking up Black Fleet for $10 at their FLGS. This could be a thing. 
a FLGS near me (meeplemart in Toronto) said they were taking part when they received stock, but haven't updated since about it taking place.
Leaving Earth is amazing, and solving the puzzles are only half the game if you're playing with other people. It becomes a tense space race with lots of risk management with two, and a crazy negotiation game with 4 or 5. 
I thought you were an astronaut trying to find a board game... lol
*Agricola* and *Caverna* are fairly similar.  Key differences are:

* It is more difficult to get food in *Agricola*, so you have to spend more time setting up a food engine rather than a victory point engine in that game.
* *Agricola* uses a hand of occupation and minor improvement cards to guide your strategy rather than a set of rooms open to everyone to build, but without altering the rules the "luck of the draw" can significantly bias a game towards a player.
* *Agricola* has an expansion that adds more difficulty by making you also consider heating your home.

Overall, I'd say if you don't like *Caverna*, you should try before you buy *Agricola* - it might not be punshing enough for you.

***********************************

*Leaving Earth* is a logistics game.  Its all about mission planning - which means its all about figuring out how much thrust you need to get somewhere as you shed mass in order to complete cards for VP.  What makes it tight is the fixed $25M/year budget that is "use it or lose it" just like in the real world.  Since you use a subset of VP cards for the game, there is no "get the ideal solution to use every game" strategy - and if there were such an ideal solution, then the game would be determined by turn order.  There are also a few other random cards (radiation effects, planetary/moon surfaces, and each technology gets 1 or 3 cards on it from a deck of 15 major failure, 15 minor failures, and 60 successes) with a small amount of randomness (2-4 options).  These will also prevent a universal optimum rocket build.

However, it is a very deterministic and not random at all (unlike *High Frontier*), and it also covers a historical period rather than a hypothetical future (again, unlike *High Frontier*).  Is it punishing?  Yes and no.  Is it solvable?  Not really.  However, its "math-y" nature makes it not a game for everyone.

Do you play 18xx Train games?  One of those might be up your ally - math-y stock market type gameplay that can be quite punishing.  Its something I've been meaning to get into, but haven't paid for yet (because the games tend to have smaller print runs and thus higher prices).  It isn't SF, but it might be something that matches your tastes - but, again, try before you buy... and as always, you could substitute YouTube play through videos for actual play if you don't have access to the game.
Thanks for posting this i'm sure it'll be of benefit5 to many people. 

I watched an overview (not this video) and then just set it up and played.

Do not try and read the rulebook from front to back without the pieces setup. you'll never make it :)
you are amazing. I cant get through the rulebook without crying
Thank you, haven't opened up my copy from Essen yet.
I wonder if the creator of this video has played Neanderthal or Greenland.  Curious to see how many plays one may require to feel confident at this one.  Neanderthal took me almost 4 plays to get my legs.

Great video really enjoyed the internalization he exhibits.
I'm surprised at how many have already popped up for Bios Genesis.  However, while play throughs are nice, I really appreciate these small channels that turn out great tutorial videos for Sierra Madre Games titles.  Namely:

* [Jeremy Antley's **Bios Genesis Overview**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKW2bq5Y7oI)

* [Modern Tablegamer's 2 part series **Pax Porfiriana - How to Play**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43kJa53g_pY)

* and [Catweasel Videos' **Pax Pamir Overview**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50fOx011Fgw)

If you have these games or are interested in them, these are great places to start learning the rules before your first play.

[And here is a Geeklist of all the new games I played.](http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/217652/new-games-i-played-bggcon-2016)
I'm interested to watch the video later. Flamme Rouge as #1 is intriguing.
Really enjoy your videos! Insider looks like a good alternative party game after playing the same ones over and over. 

Also I've been really interested in Terraforming Mars so glad to see it up there. I've seen people giving great reviews on the components but it's funny that you didn't like the artwork because I hadn't even noticed how bad it was until you said that. It does kind of look like the art was designed by an engineer.
What did you think of Ulm? Saw it on the Geeklist but after perusing BGG the opinions seem to be a bit mixed.   
hi Chris, I've subscribed! this was really slick and I enjoyed it. Thanks!
I think I remember playing Kingdomino and Kanagawa with you at BBG.con on Sunday at about 2 in the morning. Came in second both games with you winning, lol.

Thanks for teaching both. I'm gonna pick up Kanagawa and take a look at Flamme Rouge.
[Cool Stuff Inc](http://www.coolstuffinc.com/p/230613) has 20+ copies

..so does [Miniature Market](http://www.miniaturemarket.com/ffgmad20.html)

how hard did you look?
No, Mansions of Madness is not out of print. It may be out of *stock*, because they recently released a second edition that's been very popular. Keep any eye out, they'll get restocked.

It's almost Christmas, so it's likely all the stock has been bought up. Board games are very hard to keep in stock consistently, there's an ebb and flow of being available and between print runs.
It's on sale at CoolStuffInc right now...
Ordered mine from Barnes & Noble's website with the 30% one-item discount and the 15% Cyber Monday discount. Came out to like $65 bucks.
I literally bought a bag last week for cycling games (and my other stuff) to and from games nights, after finding the square box of Great Western Trail wouldn't fit in my regular bag nor my backup laptop bag. I went for [this Lomo 40l bag](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lomo-Dry-Bag-Walking-Rucksack/dp/B00E8JFS9W/ "arrrgh, shield my eyes"). (They do a dedicated cycling one, but I liked this one better as it's bigger and not yellow.) I can now happily carry around a copy of Gloomhaven, Kingdom Death: Monster and Scythe at the same time (joke).

If you're not bothered about waterproofing, then there was a thread a while back about people buying an inexpensive [cajon drum rucksack](http://www.gear4music.com/Drums-and-Percussion/Cajon-Bag-by-Gear4music/L34) for carrying games. They tend to be quite large and rectangular as the drums they're designed to carry are large and rectangular.
As was recommended to me, I will point you to the [ChromaCast Padded Cajon Bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IRMEZTK). It is originally designed to hold a particular type of Peruvian drum. But works amazing for board games. Only downside I personally had is that now my Amazon "would you also like to buy" suggestions are littered with tambourines and castanets. But I can live with that.

Some pics from other users last time this question was posted. http://imgur.com/a/bk39t https://imgur.com/a/eYNsF http://i.imgur.com/BRxBn7q.jpg 
Personally I would recommend any of the bags designed for carrying laptops, they tend to be squarer in shape so shouldn't put too much pressure on square boxes inside plus they are often padded at the base which helps protect them pretty well. 
I use the KR kaiser 2 for all my gaming. 

Fits 2 of their pluck foam card cases OR 2 ikea samla storage crates magnetised to carry anything OR 2-3 large box games/several small box games. 

Has a ton of zip/velcro pockets for books, dice etc. 


If I was driving and wanted to carry a ton of boxed games I'd just chuck them into a cajon bag or a big canvas toolbag. 
The two Games are very different mechanically. COI is a resource management double deck builder. EOTV is more a lite 4x game with some quirky territory control. Owning both, COI gets to the table more but that's just my group. COI 1st edition is just fine and the expansion adds some fun
 stuff while the 2nd end is prettier but doesn't have all those expansion options. Yet.
Can you even find EOTV for purchase? I thought it was long out of print.
I thought the same, that they might be too similar, but Hostage Negotiator has a very different vibe from Friday. 

The pacing, for one, is a lot more even in Friday. Building up the ideal deck and getting a sense of how you do that best is fairly uninform from game to game. That doesn't mean the deck will always be friendly, but the algorithm doesn't change much for how you achieve a good end score.

In Hostage Negotiator, the dice rolls and Terror Cards drawn after the rolling portion of each round can produce some pretty dramatic swings throughout the game. Add this to the different Hostage Taker scenarios and you'll notice that you'll face a broader spectrum of tactical options than are available in Friday. 

I've enjoyed both, but definitely notice more of an element of uncertainty and volatility in Hostage Negotiator...which I guess fits very well with the theme.
I love **Friday** but found **Hostage Negotiator** to be really boring - they're really very different styles of game. Granted, they both have a lot of chance, but Hostage Negotiator felt too chaotic to me.

As another commenter said, **Space Hulk: Death Angel** is a good single-player game, though the theme is very dark.
I love Friday. It's not my #1 solo game, that honour goes to Coffee Roaster, but that can be hard to find.

To answer your question, I find Hostage Negotiator is nothing like Friday, and I find it is just OK. Very difficult to win. It's alright, but nowhere near as good as Friday.

I like Space Hulk: Death Angel, but it's hard. Not unwinnable, though. I still prefer Friday, and many other games for my solo fix.

Now, for games better than Hostage Negotiator, in my opinion, which also play solo...

You may want to look at the Oniverse games. Onirim, Sylvion, Castellion, Nautilion (and eventually Urbion will be reprinted). Nautilion is the latest, releases in about a week, and seems like it will get the most play out of the lot based on videos I've seen. But I like all of them (except Urbion, as I missed the first printing). They all can play co-op for 2 players as well as primarily solo.

There are more traditional deck-builders that can be played solo which might be worth your look, such as Ascension and Attack on Titan.

The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game is a tiny box, plays great solo and can go up to 4 players (if you have a large enough table to splay all the necessary cards out.

Cosmic Run is a cool little game that can play solo or multi-player competitive or co-op. Worth a look!


Multiuniversum can play 1-5 players, and it's an elegant system I've not seen before. You seal portals and move your meeple around to different stations, play cards to do actions... I like it a ton. There's a Cthulhu expansion coming out that seems like it adds some nice elements too. The same developer made the solo-only game Agent Decker, which is supposed to be published soon, but the print-and-play is available and worth checking out.

Viticulture, New Bedford, and Agricola are all worker placement games that can be played solo, and work great with 2 players as well, though they do go higher than that.

Pandemic: The Cure is fairly quick and fun, lots of dice to roll. It's a co-op game for 2-4 players I believe, but it's very easy to play it solo too.

Any of these games I've mentioned I will pull out before taking Hostage Negotiator off the shelf... So, I kinda think to answer your second question, it's not really a good move to buy it. But that might just be me. I want to enjoy it more, I just don't (maybe because I have so many other, better games).
Completely different play styles and theme.  I have both and have never felt they overlapped.   Buy with confidence 
I haven't played **Hostage Negotiator**, but you might like **Space Hulk: Death Angel**, which has a lot of the same tension as Friday, but with a really different feel and theme.  It also supports 1-4 players.
These are the ones that my wife and I love to play as 2-player games.

**Viticulture Essential Edition** is our favorite worker placement game so far.

**Beyond Baker Street** is like Hanabi, with theme. I've heard Hanabi doesn't play very well with 2 players, and I like theme in my games, so I skipped straight to Baker Street. We like it a lot, as we need to co-operate and it isn't like any other games.... Well, except Hanabi. lol

**Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy** is a great little game where you're kinda doing worker placement, but mostly focusing on building out your family tree. It's cool, though it uses a lot of table space. (Our table is smallish).

**Eight-Minute Empire: Legends** if you want a lighter kind of war/area control. It doesn't last an hour, but you will probably want to play it more than once, because it's pretty good!

**Patchwork** is a great little game that has the Tetris touch. I replaced the cardboard buttons with real ones for a more thematic experience. I'd like to replace all the tiles with fabric, but I lack the skill to do that.

**Jaipur** is a marketplace game. It's quick and easy to learn, and it's very highly-rated and almost always recommended, and for good reason.

**The Networks** is a cool game about running your own TV stations. You hire stars, run ads, and run shows. We dig it!

**The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** uses a lot of table space, but it's pretty great.

**The Castles of Burgundy** uses less table space than the Card Game version, but also takes longer to play. Not that big a deal, because we love it, too!

**Ascension: Dreamscape** or really almost any of the Ascension sets. It's a deck-building game with a fantasy theme. If you prefer a sci-fi version, there's Star Realms, which is fairly similar.

**Cosmic Run** is a dice-chucking race to explore 5 planets. It's pretty good! The same guy made Biblios and Capo dei Capi, both of which I own and the wife and I enjoy playing all three.

**Mouse Guard: Swords and Strongholds** replaces chess for us. Well, for me. My wife hasn't played chess. It's simpler, much simpler, and shorter, but it's fun. And she wins more than I do, and it has cute little plastic mice pawns.

**Lotus** if you want set collection, with a touch of area control. Beautiful cards that splay out as flowers.

**Pandemic: The Cure** - We don't care much for the original Pandemic, but we like chucking dice in this faster, simpler version. Lots of dice, we dig it!

**Attack on Titan: The Deck-Building Game** - I don't have this yet, but it looks fun from the videos I've watched. I sold my copy of Legendary Encounters: Alien because I didn't get it to the table very often, and this is what I hope will replace it. I'll also be playing it solo.

**Black Orchestra** - my pre-ordered copy should arrive this week, I hope. You play as members of the WWII-era Nazi party, co-operating and attempting to assassinate Hitler and save millions of lives of Jewish people. It seems respectful of the source material, and I am very much looking forward to playing it with my wife and solo, and with a bigger group, too.

**New Bedford** is another worker placement game, with a whaling theme. We both really like it, despite the theme. Not as much as Viticulture, but I like it quite a lot.

**Shadowrun Crossfire** is a card game where it's fairly simple to play, but very hard to win... We like trying to win... Someday, it'll happen. Maybe. It also has persistent characters, so you can spend your earned experience points (called Karma in this game) on permanent upgrades via stickers that you put on your character sheet.
Couldn't recommend Jaipur enough. I kind of disregarded it at first because I just didn't think it looked that appealing but I will admit I was wrong. People even recommended it to me as a great 2 player game but for whatever reason it took me a while to give it a chance. It has quickly become the favourite 2 player game for my wife and I but and couldn't recommend it highly enough. 
I find Ticket to Ride works great with 2 and up.
Hounded is amazing.  :)
If you like co-op games, [**Onirim**](https://youtu.be/u2c0R5J3U9U) is a great co-op game to play with 2 players. Granted you can play with only yourself (it is 1 or 2 player game).  But being able to work together on a common goal can make it easy to have fun with a game.  Just don't use all 7 expansions (the 2nd edition comes with all 7 expansions) in the game.

Pocket Hive - Easy to learn, great strategy.

Some i games not specially for two that i love playing with two:

Coloretto - light card game

Dale of Merchants - light yet thematic deck builder. Love the theme and art!

Belle of the Ball - thematic set collection card game

Tokaido - it's lighthearted, has very eye pleasing aesthetic and fun gameplay.
War of the Ring and Star Wars: Rebellion are some big ones. I've found that Eldritch Horror and Mansions of Madness Second Edition also plays fine with 2 players, if you are into co-op. 
Just throwing another vote in for Patchwork. I also very much enjoy Lost Cities (the card game) and Cold War: CIA vs KGB (also a card game). Lost Cities doesn't have a ton of complexity but Patchwork and Cold War have a ton of replayability.
We mainly play 2-player games, so talking about this is quite fun!

We adore:

-- **Castles of Burgundy**

-- **Bruges**

-- **Patchwork**

-- **Among the Stars** (variant for 2 players)


Games hard to put somewhere because we have not played them enough yet:

-- **Troyes** (I think this will be in the category of Castles and Bruges)

-- **Targi** (I think this one will end on the lower list)


Games we liked but don't play that much anymore (2-player)

-- **Agricola** (but I recently got Farmers of the Moor and the Deluxe euro bits, so we might play it this week / next week)

-- **Voyages of Marco polo**

-- **Pandemic**

-- **Splendor**

-- **Alhambra**

-- **Jaipur** (tbh, I think this should be on the chopping boards. I can't even remember when we last played it, I don't even think we've played it this year. I think that says something for such a filler 2p game. I'm just really hesitant in selling the game, though.)

We're selling:

-- **Macao** (Just didn't click for us and we believe we have better games or atleast more satisfying games (that's the better word))

Would love to play a long game of **Le Havre**. Have played two short games (2p) and 1 short game (5p) (don't ask), curious how the long version is for Le Havre on 2p.

Looking forward to try **Grand Austria Hotel** and **Akrotiri** looks really good aswell. 
**Kemet** is a pretty fantastic game that plays well with 2-5 players (well, 2 and 4 for sure, just making assumptions about 3 and 5). It's a little more complicated than Carcassonne, but I think it's manageable, also I'm pretty sure the rules are available online if you wanna check it out.
* Battle line
* Ticket to Ride Anniversary edition  
* Ascension, Star Realms, Dominion (my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5f8wfq/what_game_have_you_played_more_than_30_times_and/daiquek/) on differences)    
* Race for the Galaxy (if you like card > dice)  
* Roll for the Galaxy (if you like dice > card)  
* Tsuro

Extras: Really good 2P games with lots of depth & replayability, but certainly not easy to explain nor cheap  
  
* Star Wars X-wing, Imperial Assault (skirmish), Rebellion   
* Twilight Struggle  
* Netrunner  
* Mage Wars  
* Conflict of Heroes  

There was no Jamaica on TableTop.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TableTop_(web_series)
Did they play it during one of the tabletop day streams? 
Nope there has been no episode of Jamaica by TableTop. I know this as back when I considered buying Jamaica I could barely find any playthrough videos of it that gave me a feel for the game and the one that did, is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPPPC1H0zRI
Maybe you remember the Catan:Junior episode as that game also has plastic ship minis
I don't recall there ever being an episode with Jamaica. If there was, I certainly would've declined the one time I was cajoled into playing it :)
Probably just stuck in your mind because the Dice Tower used to rant and rave about it...
There's a Dice Tower episode which broadly describes the game flow, maybe that's what you remember.
I've bought Elder Sign twice. I played it once both times and traded it away lol 
The only one so far for me is **Love Letter**, but barely.  I got a second copy as a sweetener in a math trade, that I proceeded to include in a small games bundle in a subsequent MT.
Only one... Reiner Knizia's **Ra**. I didn't care for it in my first playthrough, but we played it as a 2p game. Later on, I decided I'd really like to find a copy again and try it as a 3p+, where it shines. I even found someone willing to trade me a lovely shrink-wrapped Rio Grande edition of the game.
I accidentally bought a copy of Catan the Dice Game when I already had one on order at my FLGS, so I sold one to a co-worker. I think I've played it twice...

I sold The Resistance to my sister and brother-in-law as they were flying out of the country and wouldn't have time to stop at a game store to pick it up before leaving. I ordered a replacement copy before they even left.

Also, if it counts, I sold Batman Love Letter and bought the regular (Tempest) Love Letter.

I did sell Mice & Mystics before playing it, and plan to eventually re-buy it when my group has time for another campaign game. Also sold Dixit and Dixit Odyssey to my brother-in-law and sister, but have yet to replace it (I do plan to, eventually).

There's one other one I think, but can't put my finger on what it was at the moment.
A few.  

Traded away Knizia's **Africa** and rebought it years later.  I have a backup unpunched copy of **Titan**, and a second copy of **Agricola** that I bought on sale for $20 because someone stepped on my box.  A friend gave me a beautiful laser-cut wooden frame, so I bought a copy of **Settlers of Catan**, but huzzah, the game was still pretty boring.

I got a copy of the plastic-tile version of **Hive** after trading away the original wood version, mostly so that I could assay the tiles and verify what I already knew, which is that they're not made of Bakelite or any other phenolic resin.

I lost **Magic Realm** in a move 30 years ago; my copy is the one I bought in 1990.  I have both **Wabash Cannonball** and **Chicago Express**, which I think is a pretty reasonable upgrade.  I also have **Age of Craft** and **Colony**, but that's not quite the same thing.)  I have a second copy of **1830** that someone gave me.

I'm sure there are more.  There are shelves I haven't looked at in a while.
I sold a big portion of my collection when I had to move several years ago. So far the only one I've reacquired is **Evo**, but I may be getting **Formula D(e)** again. That one was a lot of fun. If/when **Java** gets a reprint I'll get that one as well.
I'm considering getting **Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective** again. Got it in my 2nd shipment of board games ever, went "the fuck is this? Why didn't I do any research?" and sold it. Now that I know things, I'm considering picking up a secondhand copy.
I replaced base game Pandemic because the first edition box was not as neat a fit on my shelves as the second edition box, and I also had  choose to either buy the 2nd edition or buy the upgrade kit so I could play with expansions.

Escape from Colditz, technically.  I had it as a kid and just picked up the new one.
**Scotland Yard** and **Cluedo** "vanished" from my collection, never found out what happened to them.  
Even though they are rather boring in my opinion, I got replacements just for the sake of it. :-)

I've bought several replacement card sets for **Settlers of Catan** back in the days.
Lost **Coloretto** and **Cosmic Wimpout** on a backpacking trip. I've replaced Coloretto (and was surprised to find the new version came with extra wildcards that weren't in the original). I haven't yet gotten a new Cosmic Wimpout because I'm too sad that I lost the one that came with a bandana and a leather drawstring pouch.
I've sold all my heroclix and restarted several times since they first came out in 02. (side note if anyone needs a shit ton of clix let me know wink wink)

Just traded some games for Imperial Assault since they have an app coming out soon. Sold it originally since I wasn't a fan of having to have a Game master.
I sold **Yomi** and got it back again. I got it back because it's got a lot of great traits like Magic, but without the excessive complexity and keywords like first strike, shadow, prowess, flashback, undying, flying, trample, hexproof, etc. Yomi plays fast, only requires cards and setup is just a shuffle and drawing 7 cards. It's my go-to 1v1 game because despite all the flashy abilities and combinations, the heart of the game is rock-paper-scissor that's both accessible and winnable for anybody. The nearest comparable game is BattleCON which I need to try, but I'm turned off by the setting up of the board, finding the appropriate figures and tokens, the constant moving of the figures, the informational overload of the bases and modifiers of both me and my opponent and the overall play time.
In the mid to late 90s I lost most of my games and tabletop RPGs in a move.  I managed to hold on to *Iron Dragon* from that time, but I've reacquired:

* **Eurorails**
* **Babylon 5 2258 Core Set**
* **Clue** (Okay, I though I was getting *Clue* but it was the *Clue Master Set* which adds more of the same plus changes up some mechanics, and yes I still think it is a solid deduction game.)
* **Scrabble** (Yes, another hated classic that I still consider to be a good game.)
* **Dominoes**
* **Mancala**
* **Chess** (The above 3 are classics that most hate and I play on rare occassions, mostly because people trash talk these acceptable games and thus no one wants the stygma of being seen playing them anymore.)
* **The Fellowship of the Ring** (*The* alternative plot generator for the books - focuses on characters and not armies, freedom to do what you want, and hidden movement on both sides.  When my wife gets the chance and learns the game, I look forward to a nice 5 or 6 hour game with her.)
* **Icebergs** (I found it for cheap, so I added it to my rebuilding TSR minigame collection; however, this one wasn't that good.)
* **Saga** (Another TSR minigame that hasn't aged too well - it is very random and a bit too long for what it is.)
* **Viking Gods** (A third TSR minigame that I still enjoy quite a bit; basic hex-and-counter wargame with very simple rules and acceptable play length.)
* **Mastermind** (Thrift store purchase, for my wife who loves the game.  It was never my type of game, but if she enjoys it then I'll play it.  However, I put an app on her smartphone and she plays it that way now.)
* **Car Wars** (Actually, the recent reprint version as the classic Steve Jackson pocket game goes for way too much.)
* **Ogre: Pocket Edition** (Another reprint, because dang this one is expensive in original form.  If only they would reprint G.E.V. and others in the series.)
* **Pandemic + On the Brink** (Okay, not a re-acquire but a re-purchase.  Found a used 1e and my 1e had worn out cards, so my wife and I decided to get a backup copy.)

There are a lot of pocket/mini games that I want to get, and there are a bunch of vintage games I never could get but thanks to sites like boardgamegeek and Noble Knight Games I am finally able to get them.  More often than not I get them out of nostalgia, but I usually enjoy playing them.
I got **pandemic** in à trade twice and traded it twice haha 


I also got re-aquired **hive** after trading it away, i missed it  
Tried out **Dead Men Tell No Tales** and had a blast, although the crowd I played it with was rather annoying and cumbersome (5 players, wife and sister-in-law sat out to chat, which was distracting). I think at 4 or 5 with no side conversations, it'll be a blast.

Also played a round of **Sushi GO!**. I was a little thrown by the rules, but it was a ton of fun.

Afer that, played some classic **King of Tokyo** which is always fun.
I'm a relative newcomer to boardgaming (outside the classic Monopoly/Risk combo from growing up...), so this was the first year I bought games with me. Family response was mixed. My sister wanted to play just about every game I had, while some family I expected to be really interested in some of the games (namely bluffing ones) had zero interest in the end.

On Wednesday, I got my mom, aunt, and cousin to play Evolution with me. They had fun, and my mom somehow managed a smashing win using a carnivore build and combo-ing scavenger off it. Right after I had finished explaining how carnivores are usually kingmakers but not game winners themselves...

Thanksgiving day, my mom, sister, and grandmother played Splendor. My grandmother absolutely loves that game, and managed some well executed wins on us. We then did a round of Mille Bornes, mostly because of nostalgia. My dad's family used to play that with us a lot when I was a kid, so I had picked up a copy cheap for old time's sake. The official rules are a lot different from what I remembered...not sure if rules changed or if we had a lot of house rules. Probably both.

Black Friday, I broke out Zombicide. I had really intended to do Castles of Burgundy, but got outvoted. Initially it was with my sister and my mom, and my mom swapped out for my cousin when she got home. We ended up playing that for way too long, something like 8 hours in the end I think. I know my aunt watched 2 of the Godfather movies in their entirety and we were still going. We then wrapped up the late, late night gaming with drinks and Sheriff of Nottingham, which my mom got progressively better at the more she drank.

I had hoped to do Burgundy, as mentioned, along with some Coup and more Sheriff, as I saw those games as ones my family would enjoy. I had Codenames standing by as well, but there was little interest in that aside from my sister. Since I had to explain the concept of every game to them all, I'm not sure if I sold it poorly or if they just did not like the concept. In the end though, I had a ton of fun, and it was great to finally get someone to play Zombicide with! I don't bring that to my usual boardgame meetups as its a tad space-hungry and wouldn't work well at the venue.

I tend to get games in the 30-60min range, with a couple extending out to 90min, due to the lessons learned from loving Risk when I was growing up. No one wants to play a 2 hour game, it feels like, much less a 9+ hour one. Since I got back into board gaming this year, I think my longest was a shade over 2 hours, and was an 8 player game of Red Dragon Inn 2 with a lot of newbie players (hence the slowness as rules were constantly re-explained each new person's turn).


Post-Thanksgiving dinner drinks came along with some friends for some light gaming ...

**Codenames**. Fun without fail. First game was terrific. I was spymaster against a neighbor who was talked up as a really good spymaster. I got an early lead, six of my clues down to only two of theirs in my first two turns. But then he jumped back to tie up. Had no idea how to get all three of my remaining clues ... but got two. OK, my only hope was that his team would hit a wall and only get one of their remaining two clues. He gave his clue. And then the debate amongst his team began. The two of us had a damn hard time keeping a straight face as, for the last two clues they were deciding between three: two being the correct clues ... and one being the assassin. (If I recall, his clue was *police* and they were choosing between *force, cycle and stick*. The winning clues were force and stick, cycle was the assassin.) They choose force. OK, one to go. They split their vote, two for cycle, two for stick. More discussion, as the cycle-favoring group convinced one team mate that because there are bicycle police, he must mean cycle. ASSASSIN!

Then gave **Spyfall** a go; I'd picked it up on impulse a couple weeks back. Of the rounds we played, only did one where we adopted the "roles" on the cards, just keeping to general discussion of the location. Quite fun.

To end the night, a few rounds of **Coup**. I'll always like Coup.

**Questions**

My immediate family ... if we're talking parents and siblings, very rarely. I see my parents 1-2 times a year, brother 1-2 times a year, and sister maybe once every 2-3 years. When we do see each other, yeah, there are games involved. If immediate family means my partner, yup, we play a few games a week. She's just as interested as I am, though there are some games where our interest doesn't intersect.

Longest? Had a game of Dominant Species (which I **love**) with some serious AP players that we had to call after four hours. The dominance deck wasn't even halfway through at that time, so had we played out the full game, at the same pace, we would've hit the 8 or 9 hour mark. Everyone was so afraid of giving points away that they'd have dropped 1-2 action pawns onto the Dominance action. But by the time it came to do dominations, board state had changed enough that the tiles they'd hoped to play domination on either had changed dominance, or someone had more species cubes. So you'd have people passing on their dominance action because they couldn't stand to give other players more points on an Ocean tile.
**Stockpile**  
**Cry Havoc**  
**Beyond Baker Street**  
**Order of the Gilded Compass**  
**Betrayal at House on the Hill / Widow's Walk**
I got to play a 6 player game of **Chicago Express** with the Erie Railroad expansion. The Erie is interesting because it is the only company with ONE share, which means if you win it, it's all yours. What's also important to note is because there's only one share, you will only get to capitalize it once which means you should put an ample amount of funds into it as it won't ever get more funding.

Anyways, there were some highlights include the opening turn. P1 had a red, P2 (me) had no shares, P3 had a green, P4 had a blue, P5 had a yellow and P6 had no shares. P1 null auctioned. I auctioned red, but I put my full 20 into it because if I didn't, P6 would have done it and I would be out of a share for the round. P3 then null auctioned. I was proud of this group because they understood how important null auctions were in that it removes power from a player with a lot of money. It sucked for P6, but it was his fault that he didn't aggressively go after a share in the opening bid.

At a later point in the game, P3 picked up the Erie. The Erie effectively takes that player out of the game as that player will only build the Erie on their turn. After playing with that expansion, I think I will keep it on by default when playing with 5 or 6. It keeps the play tighter for the rest of the players as the Erie player will only tend to their own business. The Erie player did not have funds to make it to Chicago, so it went backwards towards New York. It was barely able to make it after it developed in a forest hex, inserting $2 into its coffers. That's probably the second time ever that I've seen that move being done as normally it is never done.

P5 ended up winning the game and I tied with P1. I (P2) ended up with a red and blue share, whereas P1 only had a single red share the entire game. Red was split 3 ways between P1, P2 (myself) and P6 and also made it to Chicago. It was an interesting game and despite the warnings of it being chaotic from many critics, I had a great time with this player count and would be more than happy to play with 6 again. A lot of people said they had a good time despite the game being mathy and confrontational. 

Chicago Express is still one of my favorite games because one small move can change the player dynamics so much. Euro games can bore me because of how solitaire a lot of them are. American games punish those who play well by having everyone sandbag the leader. This game provides confrontation, yet it does so in an intelligent way by encouraging it with incentives rather than blindly attacking the leader. The game plays relatively fast and has a great spread of player ranges from 3-6 (I will not play the game with 2). I can't wait to play again.

Do I ever play with family? Never.

Longest game? Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition at 10 hours.
I finally got around to play **Amerigo**. 4 player game with Feld fans and it was amazing, we loved the tower mechanic, the uncertainty of the actions you could get (one turn a player needed cannons so he waited for the black cubes to be dropped on the tower... and no one came down! they pretty much stayed there until the next round loosing him like 10 points) and overall the game as a whole.  
This friday is another FeldFriday and we will be playing Trajan and Bora Bora.
**Lords of Waterdeep** - this game was soo good. Gave it to my brother for his Birthday and he, and his gf loved it. Played one game with them when in the weekend and it was great. Eveything seems well balanced, the Lord, the buildings and the quests all give the vibe of something is going to happen until the moment, one goes to the Harbor and plays an intrigue card. 
**Eldritch Horror** - Had played solo a couple of times, decided to bring it to a group of four... Picked the Azatoth AO, as the simpliest one, but, since I did not want to spend too much time preparing the game and risk boring people I didn't remove the hard mythos cards. Hopefuly, they all picked up the rules quickly, although I did keep explaining many minor rules for the rest of the game. Three hours later and after a series of hard mythos cards (lesson learned :-P) we lost the game with one mystery to solve. 
**CONCORDIA** I dont know why I waited too long to pick it up. And when I did, I still didnt play it right away. But now that my group had, we're in love with it! Super fun game! 
*Agricola (app)* - Love this game, and I use the iPad app to play ~30 games at the same time.
*Galaxy Trucker (app)* - I just discover this game, and I am into the standard campaign right now.
For family and relative: My nephew will try to win me in a game of *Stone Age* whenever we met.
**Agricola** (3p) - First time 3p, it's a nice player count, perhaps a tad tighter than 2p/4p

**Sekigahara** (2p) - A delight of a game. Been through just some learning games with the wife, didn't finish one yet. I love how the gameplay reflects the backstabbing and intriguing of the real battle.

**Patchwork** (2p) - Total beginner beat me and I didn't feel I made bad decisions. I even took the 7x7 tile! Made me realize that I enjoy the game but I probably don't really understand optimal play, I don't know which pieces are "expensive" when you consider both time/cost.
*Pandemic*-introduced my sister and brother in law to this over thanksgiving. Can't wait to introduce them to a few more games at Christmas.   
*Sushi Go*- Picked this up at Barnes and Noble for $5 played it with my girlfriend tonight. Fun game. Probably a lot better with more than two people. I also shuffled poorly since there was at least 4 chopsticks in one hand.  
*7 Wonders Duel*- A game the girlfriend and I enjoy playing quite a bit. Fast, simple and a little bit of strategy. 
*Puerto Rico (app)* - Its been staring at me for months now, asking if I bought it just to neglect it. 

*Eldritch Horror (base)* - My first play through! Although I didn't finish because my daughter wanted to play with me, and I would rather have played...

*Islebound* - Deceptively deeper than it seems. Such a cool game. Spent a good chunk of my weekend making a foam core insert for it. 

*Coup* - My daughter always wants to play Coup. We got in about four rounds before being chased away. 

*Secret Hitler* - The biggest hit of Thanksgiving and a real win with me for my game averse family. We played roughly six billion rounds. Everybody was chuffed. Should've sleeved everything beforehand. 

*Backgammon* - My father-in-law is all about backgammon. Late one evening, my wife taught me to play. 

*Sushi Go* - Then I got my wife to play Sushi Go, hoping it would get her hooked. It didn't work. But that's OK. Also, I was stinking drunk. 

*Love Letter - Adventure Time* - Another favorite of my kiddo's. And mine. Never gets old, and I love the theme. 

*Smallworld (app)* - Just rediscovered this on my iPad. Also never gets old, oddly. 

*Word Domination* - Figured we'd test drive the ol' PnP I've had sitting around for awhile. Not as fun as I had hoped, but I had to use coins instead of cubes and my kid was tired. 

*Agricola (app)* - I was dreaming about Agricola last night and needed a quick fix. 
**welcome back to the dungeon** was welcomed addition to our collection that I've been waiting to get a hold of. With a little more depth and interesting characters, this version stayed doing everything right and was just what i wanted. **pixel tactics 3** to go with pt2. More of the same but in a good way. **lotus** loved it and I want to play more
I started playing solitaire Legendary the other day. It's surprisingly still a lot of fun.
Over the past three days I've played Vast - The Crystal Caverns, Solo for the knight, the Dragon and the Goblin roles. Only one left to discover is the Thief before I have to find another human being capable of putting up with me for 90 minutes so I can try the Cave itself! 
Last night my wife and I sat down to play **7 Wonders: Duel**. She is a reluctant player, but occasionally gets into a game if she really enjoys the mechanic. The first couple of games she was hesitant and didn't super enjoy it. Last night was our 3rd play and she was enjoying it pretty thoroughly when I spilled a giant glass of water all over the table. The military track, instantly ruined. Half the tokens, instantly ruined. Almost all of the Age II cards, instantly ruined. It's comical how quickly water ruined everything. I probably won't be buying a new copy out of spite and every time I get out my ruined but most likely still playable copy I'll just get angry at myself. Looks like no more 7 Wonders: Duel for me.
Hero Realms...lot of fun.
I got the recent board game Humble Bundle for Android, so I played a bunch of solo games of Carcassonne against the computer and one against my wife. And then yesterday we had enough people show up for a birthday/board game party that we actually needed a party game, and fortunately my Black Friday purchase of Codenames had just arrived, so we quickly broke that out and played a few rounds.
One night ultimate werewolf + daybreak.  6 players.  Everyone was new to this game and mafia/deduction games in general.  That said, we had so much fun not only playing, but theory crafting cool role combinations in between rounds.  Everyone knows each other pretty well, so the metagaming came on strong once everyone understood information control and how to weave and catch people weaving lies. 
**Raiders of the North Sea** - 2 player - My first time playing, and it is a really interesting game that suprised me at the end, specifically, with regards to how to optimize worker placement as the black and then grey meeples slowly become inaccessible. Both this and the hired worker optimization provide quite a few interesting decisions, more than I had expected. On top of these, the spin on worker placement, put one down pick one up, is fresh and can cause some unexpected hiccups in getting things done efficiently. Can't wait to play this with 4 players, it has got to be cutthroat! Game is beautiful, and the metal coins are cool, overall I give it a thumbs up and I am happy that I finally got a chance to play it.

**Lords of Waterdeep** - 5 player - My SO loves this game and wanted to introduce it to her family. They are not game players beyond something like Dungeon, from their childhood. So we played with no expansion. It took some time for them to understand, probably due to my over explanation, but after the first round they were locked in and did quite well, her mom had the lord that got the bonus for building houses and no one was blocking her and she won quite handsomely...

Overall, LoW will always have a place in my heart as it was my gateway game, but, playing it without the expansion is just not as fun... Since the two games are both worker placement, I would probably chose Raiders at this juncture if we had 4, but for 5 and 6 it would be Lords.

* My family likes to play games, but, my father is a serious rules lawyer, something that I find myself doing from time to time, and it usually gets worse when he is doing poorly... As a result, i try to avoid gaming with my family... My SO's family seemed to like Lords, but I am not sure if they liked gaming, as we just didn't have time to get another game to the table.

* Longest Game - 1846 - both teaching and playing, a pause for dinner, took about 6hrs. Loved it! I want to play some of the bigger games, like TI3, but getting the stars to align is pretty tough.
We're addicted to Ticket to Ride: USA. My girlfriend bought this a couple of months ago and it's gotten me into board games as a hobby. Such a simple and fun game to play with friends and family. We'll be playing this version for a while, especially with the expansion. Rails and Sails and Europe are on the menu for the future.

I went out and bought Illuminati after reading a bit about how it's a classic and how it's held up over decades. It's a bit too complex for our group and myself. It's disappointing since it seems like such a hilarious and Machiavellian type game. We love scheming against each other, but we found it difficult to make heads or tails of the rulebook. This one is just sitting on the shelf for the time being.

Coup looks like a good alternative, so I picked that up last night. Haven't played yet, but excited to get into it.
**Junk Art** - Once again this proves to be a fun game about stacking objects upon... objects. Highly recommended for the whole family.

**Snowdonia** - Had only played it solo prior to last sunday, where my so agreed to try it. The game was way better than I expected it to be. I mean it's still a great game for solo, but I guess a real opponent is hard to beat for any good solo variant. We both had a good time shovelling rubble, converting resources into other resources and draggin workers out of the pub to lay som railroad tracks.
Wednesday Night:

* **Deep Sea Adventure** - Quick, light press-your-luck game that still has a few decisions to be made. Decent game that served its purpose as a warm-up well enough.  

* **Betrayal at House on the Hill** - This is the second time that I've played with Widow's Walk, and both of the haunts I've played so far from it have been about the worst haunts I've ever played. Maybe I've just been unlucky and gotten the bad ones, but it's given me a poor impression of the expansion so far. 

   Without spoiling too much, in the first one I played the betrayer won by locking down all of the other players and preventing them from taking their turns. There's a reason "lose a turn" effects are considered bad design - they create a negative play experience. And that's what it was, a grindy 2.5 hours of most players not being able to play the game. 

  This second one we played on Wednesday was one were the betrayer role jumped from the betrayer to his victim whenever they were attacked by him... and then the former betrayer stopped being the betrayer. Or if the betrayer couldn't make an attack on their turn, the role jumped randomly. Even for this game, it was just straight random garbage. You weren't motivated to work toward the heroes' goal since you didn't know whether or not you were still going to be a hero by your next turn. And if you did everything right as a hero and managed to fulfill your objective you could still lose the game if you got tagged by the betrayer on your last turn.

* **Mare Nostrum** - I have some friends who absolutely swear by this game, but for me it's just OK. The progression of the game seems programmed, the game space is narrow. The relationship between the powers is heavily entrenched, and while I do like some other games where that's true (IE Here I Stand) there’s no kind of clever card play like in HiS to grant variety and create interesting situations. Also, it tends to end with a whimper rather than a bang - someone buys their 5th person, or Egypt builds the pyramids. In this session there was a single battle in the course of 2 hours. I've been told that the game can go in a more military-oriented direction, but I've yet to see this happen.

   For all of this, there are some things that I enjoy about this game - the trading mechanism is clever, as is having the leaders in the three areas set the order of actions. So in sum I think the resource management and action selection half of the game is engaging and well-implemented, but I'm not convinced that the military / area control half holds its weight.

Friday Night :

* **Terraforming Mars** - Back in my home town for Thanksgiving, I met up with some old friends I hadn't seen in a while, and good times were had by all. This was actually my first play of Terraforming Mars, despite it seeing a lot of play in my regular group. I had always ended up in another game when it was getting played. 

   I was eager to try it, as it had been getting a lot of hype - and boy was the hype justified. This is one of the most satisfying heavy euros I've played in a long time. As an old Magic player I love games with lots of cards and good hand management / tableau building mechanics - and Terraforming Mars had great ones. 

   I pursued a heavy forestation strategy and came in second out of 3. Great game, I already want to play it again to try different strategies and modes - drafting sounds particularly enticing. 


* **Paris Connection** - This is one of the Queen Games that Asmodee  has been clearing out for cheap, so I picked it up. Cool lighter game that does a good job of abstracting the stock mechanisms of heavier train games. I won, and enjoyed it. Downsides are how it takes almost as long to set up as it does to play and potential lack of replay value. Time will tell for the latter.

* **Clank!** - Second play of this, with three players instead of four. Still a really fun game that  does a much better job of capturing its theme than I expected. Deck builders are usually about mechanics first, with a fitting theme being only a bonus. But here the dungeon-delving theme feels really well-implemented. 

   It was very interesting how different the pacing / progression of the game was in this session compared to the previous. Very little buying from the offer took place in the early game, and so we were much more built up by the time dragon attacks started occurring. I felt like the deck building was a much better fit to this pace than the hectic mad scramble of the 4p experience. 

   This was partly due, I think, to it being 3p rather than 4p. The 4p game makes it so dragon attacks are more frequent, there isn't really any scaling that takes place. I think 3p might be the optimal count for this game, though 4p isn't abjectly terrible or anything. 

  Replayability seems like it could be a concern, but because of the nature of the deck and the frequency of dragon attacks you're unlikely to see much of it in a single game. The opposite side of the map helps a little too, as does the varying experience with different player counts. Despite saying those things in the game's defense, it does seem likely that a problem with replay value could arise. Again, time will tell.

* **Game of Thrones: Hand of the King** - Quick play, closing out the night. Compared to FFG's other light GoT game, Westeros Intrigue, this is definitely the stronger game. That isn't necessarily high praise though, since Westeros Intrigue is straight garbage. I enjoyed Hand of the King though, it's very thinky for such a light game, compared to WI where the decisions are mostly obvious.

   There's certainly a familial resemblance with Bruno Cathala's other light games, Niya and Longhorn, in that Hand of the King is a puzzle game that's about considering what you are setting your opponents up for as much as it is about optimizing your own movements. 

   Random thoughts: Companions definitely necessary for variety... Player order balance a big concern... Team and negotiation variants seem especially pointless...?

Discussion questions: 

* My Mom will play Carcassonne now and then, but not much else. My Dad is firmly in the "Games are for kids / why can't you just play something normal like Pinochle?" category. It's unfortunate because I have such good memories of playing trivia games with them as a kid. I tried to introduce them to Timeline but it didn't take very well. 

* If you don't count asynchronous games (I've had BaJ sessions that go on for months), probably Here I Stand at 9 hours.  


I got in two games of Twilight Imperium, a game of Blood Rage, and two games of Scythe.

Our epic 8 player thanksgiving Twilight Imperium game ran us out 12 hours, with a final push for Mecatol Rex in the last round. Nobody ended up getting enough to win, but there was a tie for 9 VP between me and the actual winner, tied planets too, but he had two command counters, so he won. Great game. Lots of great memories from that one, and they're still fresh. This is close to the longest game we've ever played.

I played a 3 player game that ran 3 hours. Probably the fastest game of TI that I've ever played. I lost hard, but it was still a great game. Ended without going into all out war, with an early Imperium Rex card. 

Blood Rage was a lot of fun too. I played my first game with the 5th player. It's a little too claustrophobic with 5 players, but it still works really well.

Scythe just gets better and better. Each play of this game is super interesting. I can't think of a game since Twilight Imperium that has gotten my attention like this one.
I played **Mansions of Madness second edition** twice over the weekend. It was my first time playing. Unfortunately, the person who was "teaching" us hadn't read the rules clearly at all. We completely skipped the mythos phases the first time around, and it took me asking what the dice were for before he cracked the rulebook open and found the attack and tests sections. We had to quit that game early. The second game was incredibly entertaining though. I would definitely like to play some more. 


Managed to get a few games in this weekend:

 * 2x **Blood Rage** at three players. - Love, love, loved it. First time cracking it open and it was fantastic, possibly my new favourite game. I've been craving a good area control game since I stopped playing Risk as a child, I didn't like **Small World**, but this definitely is my area control game of choice now!

 * **Dominion: Intrigue** (using the second edition upgrade) 2x at 3 players, 3x at 2 players  - Loving the new cards, add a lot of new viable combos.
**Last Friday** - 1 x 5p -  Played this at work with some coworkers.  The theme isn't really my thing but it was entertaining enough.  We had to cut it short of the last round due to time constraints.  We (the counselors) were declared winners after a decisive previous round of keepaway.

**Vast: The Crystal Caverns** - 1 x 3p - I played this on Friday at my flgs.  One of the players was new so the game was. Little slow at the start as they learned how to play the knight.  Our cave player ended up winning.  This game is beginning to solidify itself as a game that I enjoy but one that did not blow me away like I originally expected it to.  Especially after the hype generated around the game (though I had kickstarted it well before the hype train began so this didn't play into my decision to buy the game.)

- My parents enjoy playing board games quite a bit so my wife and I will usually play at least one game with them whenever we go over to visit.

- The longest game I've played so far is probably either Arkham Horror (whichever is the older of the two) or risk.  Both were 4-5 hrs games that I did not care how the game ended by the end of it.  Though the Arkham Horror game had a slew of other issues with it as well that were due to the people we played the game with.
I played **XCOM** with some bros on Tabletop simulator. Every time we think "we can go higher than easy", we play on easy because its someones first time playing, and get a victory by the skin of our teeth.
Haven't been able to play anything in over a month, but finally had a chance to with the holiday.

Managed to get in:

**Ticket to Ride** - really only about 2/3rds of a game, but enough to satisfy.

**Mysterium** x 2 - Rapidly becoming a favorite

**Tiny Epic Western** - Enjoyed it at 2 players, looking forward to more.

**Mystery Express** - I got this in a math trade almost a year ago, but haven't been able to get it to the table. Most of my board gaming is two player, and this requires three. I adored it and think it will make a great 'over drinks' game with some friends; however, it has a lot of moving parts and definitely isn't for everyone.

I play games with my family almost every time I see them. My sister is probably the most willing, followed by her spouse, then my mother, and finally my father.
**Lords of Waterdeep**  

   

**Kingdomino**  
  
**Imhotep**  
  
**Ka-Ching**  
  
**Riff Raff**  
   
**Lift It**  
    
 
I played:

* **Takenoko** - I introduced it to my father-in-law and sister-in-law, neither of whom had played it before. My FIL got bogged down on a particular objective card but recovered nicely to finish a strong second. My SIL actually led most of the game - she had 6 objectives done before either my FIL or I had completed 4. But she hit a wall at that point and finished third. Both seemed to like the game, though. One note, it seemed like the weather die landed on the ? side with abnormal frequency, which is tough for new players to decide which action will work best at that time.
* **Codenames** - My SIL and I introduced it to the whole family. We played a total of 5 or 6 rounds with different spymasters. This was the hit of the day, I think.
* **Spontuneous** - Always a hit with the kids, because we're a very musical family. I'm not a big fan, but it's not on my do-not-play list.
* **Apples to Apples** - My son's favorite game, even though he doesn't get the clues half the time.

-----

For the most part, my immediate family play mass-market and party games. (See list above...) My in-laws play Dominion and Ticket to Ride, and my daughter will play Escape: The Curse of the Temple whenever I agree to bring it out. But those are the exception.

Longest game I have ever played was a 4-player session of Spartacus. For whatever reason, we decided to start at 1 on the influence track (I think the rulebook suggests starting at 3 or 4?) so it took forever before we had enough influence to even do much. We started early afternoon and played until nearly midnight, and even then it came down to an arena brawl to decide the winner.

Next to that, I think the longest games I have played have been 3-4 hour sessions of Deadlands: Battle for Slaughter Gulch, or "normal" sessions of Spartacus that clock in about the same.
Questions first:  

* Holidays are when I see my parents/extended family and we are all gamers of various types. Thanksgiving was no exception, we played games almost each day in the evening after doing stuff during the day. Christmas/NYE is another super big time for us and games. They do pretty good with econ games, especially shorter ones like Neue Heimat or Paris Connection. Dominion, Ticket to Ride (I can't beat my parents to save my life) and Five Tribes have all been big hits.  

* In person, it has to be Fire in the Lake clocking in around 8 hours. Also, in a strange way, it's still FitL if I look at my PBEM games. This past winter we did a medium scenario and it took like 3 months to get through the entire thing. That's tough because the holidays basically shut down the game.  

Games last week:  

* **An Infamous Traffic** (4p, 5p, and 2p). Mean game, mathematically less so at 3p I think though. I think the 5p game is sort of a waste much in the same way 6p Chicago Express sort of is; you have an almost futile illusion of control over the game state. So much so, that I don't even think conservative/defensive play is enough to help you win... I need to play it at 3p before I pass judgement, but I think this is a work of art (editor's note; excellent to look at and study, not so much as a game), and it thematically *really* fits together from my study of the time period. The use of revenue as a marker instead of income is simultaneously aggravating and brilliant. I think the short description of the game is "what would it be like if Phil Eklund created the offspring of Container and The King is Dead and made it really hard to accomplish *anything* of substance." You *must* play fast; it overstays its welcome on the table after about 75 minutes and realistically should be done in an hour.

* **Paris Connection** (13x, various counts). I've now seen winning scores of $37, and losing scores of $259. I think I've played more PC this month than I have any other game all year... (close to 20 games of it by my math). It's on sale on Amazon today, go buy it. For once, I'll agree with JCL that the hidden trackable information is a detriment and just keep the received shares in front of the screens; sharpens and simplifies the incentive management in the game and increases the critical decision ratio in the game.  

* **Neue Heimat** (4p), My elderly mother is something atrocious like 7 out of 11 games for her win record and I think I've won all of 2 games against her but this was one of them. Timed my cash liquidation perfectly to guarantee my row finished which saved me. One of the best risk/chaos management games I have. Devilish little game, I'd forgotten how much I enjoy it.
Big week of gaming for sure.  On Monday, played a MEGA GAME of **Netrunner** with the two other guys that normally show up.  Rather than have two guys play and one twiddle their thumbs, we decided to play three games at once.  We sat in a triangle and each played runner on the left and corp on the right.  It was a blast and I'm looking forward to doing it again tonight.

At Thanksgiving on Thursday, got a chance to play a couple light games with the family.  Played **King of Tokyo** and **Sheriff of Nottingham** with my wife and some of our nieces and nephews.  Had a blast, we just got married this summer and this was my first official holiday as the fun uncle.  I love it.

Picked up **King of New York** on Friday and played a couple games of that with my wife at the new FLGS in town.  It's okay, probably better with a group than 1 on 1.  Also played a little **Dominion**.

Saturday was an excellent afternoon/evening.  Our friend Nick from out of town was in town for Thanksgiving, so he came over for some games with my wife, our roommate Tom, and I.  First we played a four-player game of **Eclipse**.  My wife won for the first time ever in years of playing, she was very excited.  She was playing as Orion, which she has played before but never won.  Very well played on her part.

After **Eclipse**, Tom had to go to work, so Nick, the wife, and I decided to play **Lords of Waterdeep**.  Nick had never played it before but really like it.  He asked to play another game about halfway through.  He also won both games, quick learner haha.

At this point, it was probably around 10 or 11 and my wife was asleep on the couch.  So it was down to Nick and I, with neither of us having anything important to wake up for in the morning.  Prime time for **Star Wars Rebellion**!

Nick played the Rebels and I played the good guys.  It was actually the fastest game of **Rebellion** I've seen so far.  Found his base super early and then found it again quickly when he moved it, mopped up by round 4 haha.
Last week for Thanksgiving, me and my friends decided to stay up and wait for Black Friday by playing board games.  We managed a 12 hour board game marathon from 6 pm to 6 am where we played in order, **Terra Mystica**, **Food Chain Magnate**, **Spades**, **Dominant Species**, and **Bloodborne: The Card Game**.   It was loads of fun, and it was the first time we have ever played Terra Mystica and Food Chain Magnate, which we both concluded were both awesome just from one play.   Last year we did something similar where we played **Fire in the Lake** and a few other games, but I think that this year was a good bit better. 

I don't play games with my immediate family since they don't seem to be interested.  

The longest game I have played was an 11 hour game of **Fighting Formations: Grossdeutschland Motorized Infantry Division**.  I was playing the Germans and my friend was the Russians, and I eventually ended up conceding 3 rounds early since most of my Panzers were inoperative, and I lost my pioneers which would have made the objective 10 times easier. 
I played the game 'Zombies!!!' with my dad, stepmother and my little brother on Sunday. Took a while to get the hang of the rules, event cards and such but it was fun in the end. My stepmom ended up winning, which was good!
We played boardgame organization simulator 2016. AKA we spent 2 days cleanup the collection. http://imgur.com/a/GuKBB
This week I played Imperial Settlers - two players. It was pretty fun! It was actually my score from the board games gift exchange. 
I've got a few things I'll have to look up but it was great fun.

Longest game? Arkham Horror - 5 hours I believe over two days. 
This week we've only played with the two of us, and we played...

-- I played **Troyes** twice. I received it in the mailbox last weekend with the expansion Ladies of Troyes. The first two games we played without the components of the expansion and both games were with 2 players. I really like the character cards and we've played with 1 open and 1 closed, but I think I'm going to try 2 closed now. I'm looking forward in playing the game again! So does my SO, although she didn't have the same spark as with **Castles of Burgundy** or **Bruges**. 

What I didn't get is why the same character cards are present in the expansion as in the base game. Think it's a missed opportunity. Ah well. 

On saturday we've played a game of **Bruges**, the roles were extremely high and I had some luck of the draw in the end with cards that scored 8 and 15 points, which instantly won me the game. We both really enjoy the game and it's in our top 5, for sure. Can recommend it!
**Eclipse** (on iOS). It's fun. I don't have to remember a billion rules, set up a trillion things, and find a few other people and convince them to play Eclipse. Also because I suck at the game, I can switch all the AI to peaceful and then destroy them!

**Tiny Epic Galaxies**. I'm still at the "oh shit, I forgot that rule" of learning to play the game but I'm liking it so far. Will have more fun once I start getting a hang of the rules.
Got a game in of **Patchwork** with my sister.  First time players, the both of us, but I massacred her 30 to 1.  Being more familiar with the rules due to watching YouTube videos certainly helped to be sure.  That's ok though because as always, I was hung out to dry when we played Scrabble.  She's a monster. ;)  
Didn't win much this week, but had an incredible week of gaming:

**King of Tokyo** w/ Power Up - 4x 4-6p - Played this with some friends over dinner and with my cousins after thanks giving. Went over really well, some asked me where they could get it, which is my favorite question i get asked.

**Keyflower** - 3p - second play of this, and none of the tiles i wanted came out. No wood production without saws and no saws coming out. Ended up in a distant third, but the two other players really felt the tension. Messed up the way boats are bid on in the Winter which might have actually cost one guy the win. mb...

**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** - 4x 7p - Played with the cousins after Thanksgiving dinner. One kid kept trying to cheat, so i was worried when we let him be the forensic scientist. To my surprise he held himself back for that round. 

**Dungeon Petz** - 4p - First time playing, the theme and components were really exciting to me, but i was so confused that first round. My only goal was to not let me pets die, which became very difficult as my pets were poop machines. Also i felt like taking actions the last round didn't really help much other than the selling space and the bribing space. I'd definitely try it again.

**Evolution** - 3p - a recent purchase and hit with my friends and even my brothers friends. This was the first time i felt really starved out. My carnivore got starved out by warning calls and burrowers and the food fluctuated between 4 food to 20 food per turn. It was a run away game, but the theme always makes this a fun game for me.

**Avalon** - 1x 6p, 1x 7p - Havent played this game in over a year. Played at a meet up, i had a hard time getting into it so could never come up with a convincing lie. I was Morgan la Fey both times so i just kept pretending to vote like Merlin to at least confuse Percible. Much rather play Deception.

**Isle of Skye** - 5p - Just recieved this in a math trade, and my girlfriend and i were excited to get it to the table. Her little sister asked to come over after finishing homework so she joined us in playing with some friends. She did really well, and my GF and i enjoyed the 5p experience much more than the 2p we've had. Really want to get this out again.

**Between Two Cities** - 3x 5p - Also from recent math trade and with GF and her sister. This one was a hit! we were laughing and yelling as my friend realized we work terribly together! 

**Question 1** - I try to play games with my family every so often, but my parents are rarely in town. When they are I try to get a game going but my dad goes to bed early, like 9, so its hard. I always try to get my brother to play with me, as he is one of the few people that would play some of these more aggressive games with me.

**Question 2** - I once played a 4 hour 6p game of LoW. 2 players were new, but still... I was dying... I will never play with 6p again.


I tried **Nottingham** which is a 2006 set collection game. Interesting but it hasn't aged well.

I also tried **Garden Dice** which I also thought was fine for what it is but a little frustrating in its use of dice. If you don't roll helpful numbers late you're going to be in trouble.
This week I played...

* **King of Tokyo (6p) + power up expansion** - I think the expansion drew the game out longer, two people got knocked out early and it wasn't so great for them.

* **Diamonds (6p)** - played this twice. AP really makes the game drag, but it was pretty fun.

* **Catan (5p)** - it's been a long time since I've played Catan. I can remember why I enjoyed it, but I also really remember why I started moving away from it (particularly this game, when my numbers were not rolled).

* **Knit-Wit (5p)** - this game was amusing... But it's so subjective. I guess that's part of the fun, but it doesn't do well with my structured and competitive nature.


I also spectated **Codenames** being played and had a rocky intro to **Mahjong**. 

---

My immediate family will willingly play as long as they aren't super tired - though they definitely prefer lighter and faster games. I need to find more of those that are engaging and different to keep my interest in the game.

The longest have I've played would probably be **Game of Thrones**... The game lasted about 4-5 hours and was drawn out with a lot of AP and learning. I think the group left understanding the game and willing to play again... But it's hard to get the same group in the mood for that long of a game.
**Codenames: Pictures**

**Arboretum**

**Can't Stop**

**Blood Bowl** - oh man this makes me so happy to be playing it again.  Participating hopefully soon in a GW store vs. GW store grudge league =)

Questions:

- My wife and I game a lot together, usually w/our other couple friends.  My wife's family - many are down to play, we'll do bgs, an rpg here and there, depends upon who is in town.

- Longest game I've ever played was TI3.  Fun but it was just too long. I think that round was about 10 hours.  Longest I can tolerate anymore is a **Here I Stand** which can be lengthy but if people don't AP out too hardcore and actually think when it's not their turn, it'll take 5-6
**Bora Bora** (4p): I really enjoy Bora Bora and can't wait to play again. It was my first Feld's game and now I intend to buy a couple more.

**El Grande** (5p): I recently bought the Big Box and it was the second time I played, so we used only the base game.

**Carcassonne** with The Dragon and The Princess expansion (4p): I don't like this expansion. I prefer to play the base game instead.

**Fairy Tale** (4p x3): A light card drafting game. The cards may trigger an action flipping or unflipping other cards, but in the end it's just another card drafting game
where we score points based on the cards we drafted and their combinations. I think the game is fun, but I play it more often than I would like because my gaming group
always asks me to bring it.

Did a bunch of Thanksgiving gaming with family-in-laws. One of the highlights was **Go Away Monster** with our nephew and niece (2.5 years old). We got to break the shrink on the game, and they really enjoyed playing it! We also played some **Paris Connection** with the Germany and Iberia expansion maps, which add some new things.

I live a 6-7 hour drive away from my brother and parents, so I don't game with them that often (but when we visit, we play games with them). My husband shares the same interests as me in gaming, so he's my main gaming partner.

The longest game I've played is probably TI3 at ~6-8 hours. Not sure though. 1817 also took ~7-8 hours.
**Twilight Imperium: Third Edition**: Easily my favorite game. There is a group of four of us and a game lasts about 4 hours by now. We try to play once or twice a year. This session was easily one of the best.

**Above & Below**: I love teaching this game and seeing how people react to it. Looking forward to **Near & Far**.
* **Monikers:** This one is huge with one of my groups. We played *seven* rounds, each more hilarious than the last. The last round was one I discovered on the SUSD forums, where you have to crawl under a sheet and give clues in the form of cloaked gyrations. I added the rule that you have to be on your back the whole time. Friend crawls under there and starts flailing around maniacally, which causes everyone to crack up, especially me, because I know what the answer is. But I'm on the other team, and his team doesn't get it, and then it's my turn to crawl under the sheet, and I do the *exact same thing*, which causes him to crack up, which then causes me to crack up even more. Two adult men, supine, violently thrashing around under a sheet in an attempt to get one of the ten people crowded around them to say "Jabberwocky" has got to be one of my best gaming moments of all time.

* **San Guo Sha:** This Chinese Bang clone is sweet. It's the game that got me into board gaming originally. Most of the characters have stronger powers than their Bang counterparts, but even better, a lot of powers are based in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms lore.\*

* **Mysterium:** Don't have a lot to say about this one, other than everyone enjoyed it. I did not play this with my regular group. My friend owns it, and I'm going to give her my copy of Dixit, which is a game I don't really enjoy. It seems like the Dixit cards could definitely supplement the Mysterium ones.

* **Sylvion** & **Castellion:** These two have really set my soul on fire, especially Castellion. Brilliant solo design. I felt really smart and capable the whole time, while also immersed in the tension and challenge of the game. Looking forward to trying out the two player versions with my roommate later this week. Don't think I'm going to get Onirim, though, I watched a playthrough of it and it didn't seem as good as these two. Perhaps someone can convince me otherwise.

* **Codex:** I pursued a max-Ninjutsu hero rushdown build and my opponent (playing monoGreen) had no idea how to beat it. Tech in Fox's Den Students as early as possible, defend max level Setsuki with everything, then play two Fox's Den Students per turn and destroy all their tech buildings and base before they can get to Tech 2. Tower doesn't help because of Safe Attacking. Seems like the only counters are cards like Snapback or Origin Story, which aren't available in every color. How does Red/Green/Blue beat a hero-centric strategy, especially before Tech 2?

Unrelated to the questions provided, but something I wanted to discuss: As I've gotten deeper into boardgaming, I've found myself skewing more towards simpler, shorter games, many with a bluffing/lying element. It's hard to tell whether this is because I'm better understanding my tastes, or if it's because of the people I'm able to play with. I think it's a little of both. Rules explanations for some games I love (Dominant Species, Mage Knight, Forbidden Stars) are incredibly time-consuming, and I'm always worried people are losing interest. It's also hard to know exactly how many people are going to show up. Perhaps this is just because I'm a college student, but I've never had a stable group of, say, 4 people with whom I can play games like Archipelago and really explore the depth of the game.

One exception to this has been Captain Sonar, which has been a huge success despite its lengthier rules explanation. I think it's just because the game is *so damn good*. Has anyone else found their gaming moving towards shorter, more social games? How do you feel about this?
____________________________________________________
\*One of my favorite stories is when Zhuge Liang, legendary Chinese general, was in a poorly-defended city when an enormous enemy army arrived. He ordered the city gates to be flung open, and he was just sitting on the castle ramparts, playing an instrument. The enemy commander was so shocked by this that he ordered his army to fully retreat, suspecting an ambush. In reality, Zhuge Liang had no army, and had committed to one of the most badass bluffs in human history.
good games week.  
  
3x Games of **Bohnanza** - 2x were 4p and 1x was 3p.  The 3player game was nuts in the sense that we finished in a 3way tie.  22-22-22 and the tie breaker is who has the most cards in their hand and we each had 6 cards in our hand.  
  
3p game of **Five Tribes** - I won this one but barely.  Love this game and none of my group suffers from AP so the game went by quickly.  
  
1 - My brother is a bigger gamer than me so i'll join his group maybe once a month.  
  
2 - Longest game might be my first game of **Android** . It was clunky and we were going through the rules and it's a massive game so it was about 5hrs.  
  

**Isle of Skye**: Had been wanting to play this since I saw it in the SdJ nominee list and found out it had my last name as a clan you could play. Also I loved the theme of brewing scotch and the fact the mechanics were similar to Carcassonne but with a great marketplace phase addition. Ended up really liking it. Not sure if I'd buy it but definitely interested in playing it again.

**Libertalia**: Second time playing, really like this game, we didn't get any really good combos the first two rounds but then the third one was pretty wild. Fun game, definitely something I want to play again, or even pick up if I find it used or on sale.

**Tokaido**: Had watched the tabletop episode of this game before but never played it. Fairly interesting game, I don't think I blocked enough or skipped ahead enough and ended up doing fairly poorly but enjoyed the ride. Not sure this is one I'd really need to play again.

Acquired but didn't play: **Xcom** (have played it once and looking forward to playing again once I can get 4 people to try it), **Guildhall** (got in a trade, havent looked at it much, hopefully try it out soon)
Played a few games from the **Pyramid Arcade** box with the bf between turkey and dessert on Thanksgiving. 

On Saturday it was game night at the FLGS. Started off with a 6 player game of vanilla **Evolution**. Then moved onto a 4 player game of **Mystic Vale** since someone had it and I had been wanting to try it. The bf fell in love with the game immediately and completely forgot I told him about it months ago. He ended up buying it plus the expansion the next day. 

Next up with a 6 player game of  **Lords of Waterdeep**. I always do really good in this game and managed to win in the end. Had the leader dude where I got 4 points for each expansion quest completed and building built. Got lucky and all 6 quests I got and completed were expansion ones. Only one building though. Was still a nice amount of points at the end.

After that, played a 5 player game of **Tokaido**. Always relaxing and is another game I tend to always do very well in. Ended up winning this one as well.

Next was a 4 player game of **Tigris & Euphrates**. Finally got to play this at the full player count and really enjoyed it. I kept up my winning streak and won this game with a modest score of 8 in blue resources. 

Last game of the night was a 4 player game of **Lanterns**. Always a great game to play, especially when everyone at the table is experienced. I ended up tied for first at the end, but lost to the tie breaker. 

Also a few digital games of **Tokaido** (the bf is part of the beta for the phone version) and **Ascension** over the long weekend.

QUESTIONS!!!

* Pretty much never. The closest is the bf and his mother.

* A 5 player game of Twilight Imperium. It went on for ~12 hours and we even called it early.
Skull, Love letter, codenames, mundus novus, and an old family card game no one here will have heard of.
Blood rage is out new addition and we have been getting it to the table almost every other day.
Nice I was home for the holidays, I played quite alot. We got in multiple games of cosmic encounter, a game of eldritch horror, and a game of Robison crusoe. 
I don't normally get to play this often since my gaming friends and I all go to different colleges but it is great to finally be able to play a ton.
As for our longest game, which really isn't that long, was probably a 4 hour game of the GoT board game with 5 people

Boardgaming over the Thanksgiving holiday with siblings, nieces and nephews. **Code Names**, **Chaos Marauders**, **Sentinels of the Multiverse**, my first try at **Boss Monster**.

The longest game I've ever played is **Here I Stand**, which took about twelve hours - it's a simulation of the Protestant Reformation and the shenanigans (military, political and religious) going on in Europe at the time.

My sons love boardgaming, my daughter enjoys it on occasion, my spouse has a few games (**Ticket to Ride**, **Code Names**, **Carcasonne**) that she likes enough to play but she's not as much into the hobby as the rest of the family.
Got a lot in this past week,  but one game really stood out: Escape: Curse of the Temple. I try to play a game with my son (he's seven)  before he goes to bed as a way to end our day.  We played this last night with my wife.  

We won, but barely.  At the end,  he sat there rather intensly staring at the game.  He then looked up at me and declared,  "we shouldn't play this before bed,  my heart is going so fast it hurts."  My wife was feeling about the same. 

So the game did exactly what it was supposed to do.  But he's right,  probably not the best way to wind down at night. 

And as for the discussion questions,  I play with my son a lot.  My wife occasionally joins us. But me and him have played hundreds of games together.  He's quite good for his age,  too.  

As for my longest game? That would probably be Advanced Civilization.   I think we had a few clock in around the 10 hour mark.  Ah,  to be back in college with too much free time again. 
I finally got around to playing **Snow Tails** (2p).  Was good fun.  I always enjoy racing games, usually ones related to real world motor racing.  I'm really happy to have this in my collection, and enjoy it's unique movement mechanics.  There's some interesting planning/strategy required.  It's a keeper.

I play with immediate family all the time.  We've always been in to board games, and now more so with the heavier strategy modern games.  Unfortunately due to life with two very young children (1 and 3), gaming time has dropped heavily.  But hopefully in a few more years they'll be able to join us and we can resume frequent plays.

Longest game I've played (and own) would be **Urban Sprawl**, easily averaging 3 hours per play.  Fun game... but when playing with 4 players, way too much downtime where you can't plan your next move.
Quiet week last week:

**Las Vegas** (3p) - Fun dice chucker. Very simple game with some interesting decisions.

**Splendor** (3p) - Not my favourite game, but it's very popular, and quite thinky.

**Biblios** (3p) - I usually win this game whenever I play it, but this time I lost, winning no points!

**Beyond Baker Street** (3p) - Like Hanabi, but better! It's got more theme, and more gameplay.

I only usually play with my family around Christmas, but they're not into board games, at least not the modern ones. They usually play things like **Trivial Pursuit** or **Frustration**. I might try and introduce them to something light and fun this year.

I don't really like to get into long games, but I think the longest I've ever been in a game is a game of **Dominare**, which lasted nearly 4 hours.


**Blood Rage**, **Catan**, **Rummikub**, **Splendor**, and **Onitama**. We just got Blood Rage and it's been a blast! Catan went on a little longer than usual because we decided to pick up the 5-6 player extension. Rummikub is our go-to numbers game for the time being. I think we decided to sell/return Onitama because it just wasn't our game (Chess preferred). 
Great few days of gaming! Between Thanksgiving and having a couple of days off, we got a number of plays in!

**Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization** (1x, 2p) – This was our first playthrough of the full game (rather than the introductory, 2.5-era variant) and I *loved* it.  Yes, the game is long, and near the end, my SO was losing some steam.  To be fair, we started around 11-something and wrapped up around 5pm.  But it flew by for me, and we both really, really liked the experience. The decisions in this game are tough, and everything feels tight, but it never feels unfairly punishing.  Sure, you can get some harsh moments if you’re behind on military, but that usually means you’ve shifted your focus elsewhere and it’s not too hard to bounce back.  The game is excellent, and I see why it’s #2 on BGG.

**Terraforming Mars** (1x, 2p) – I like this game, but I don’t love it. It’s got a great theme and the gameplay itself is really fun.  In fact, I think it’s such a fantastic concept to have two players competing to help a planet become terraformed – you really get to feel like you’ve accomplished something together, even if one person ultimately will win (non-zero sum game, for those who saw Arrival).  My issue with the game is the luck via the cards, even if you use the drafting variant (which we did).  In this game, for example, my SO decided to activate the Banker Award, as she was pretty far ahead in money production.  Then, like two turns later, I got a card that boosted my Megacredit production 1 step for every 2 of the brown cards (forgetting the name – whatever you spend steel on), and I had something like 15 of those cards.  Up until that point, the benefits of having so many of those was relatively minor, but that shot up my money production a ton and I easily stole those 5 points from her.  It felt unfair, to me – almost no other card late in the game had that kind of a swingy effect on our scores.  It frustrated her, too.  Beside that, however, I think this is a pretty neat game.

**Mechs vs. Minions** (1x, 2p) – Playing the fourth mission again after having failed it with a misunderstanding of a key rule.  This time, we played it right and it was much easier, but still the same chaotic fun we were hoping for.  I love this game.  It’s huge, ridiculous, and a ton of fun. 

**Imhotep** (1x, 3p) – Played this for the first time and thought it was a pretty solid little game.  I like the mechanics in the game, though as someone who primarily plays 2 player, this will never enter our collection.  The decisions are tough in this one too, and I like the various ways in which you can score (or force your opponents to score fewer points).

**Mexica** (1x, 3p) – Also a first for us.  I really enjoyed this game, though that might have been influenced by the company (/u/markbesada).  Two of us shifted our focus from strictly winning to doing anything we could to screw the other person out of a few points, and it played out in the most hilarious way possible.  Somehow pulled away with a one-point victory over my SO (the third (neutral) player), which – given the crazy way in which the game unfolded – speaks highly to the game.

**Safranito** (1x, 3p) – Another first.  This game was pretty great! It’s like shuffleboard meets a Euro game about creating recipes.  Nothing in the game is too complex and it lends itself to some great laughs.

**Above and Below** (1x, 3p) – I like this game, but I don’t love it. I think it has some definite nice features, but ultimately it feels like you don’t get to do enough in each round, especially early on. Round 1 is usually comprised of adding a single new component to your board (player or house) and maybe exploring.  Sure, you can get some powerful combinations with some of the houses, but I actually think they need re-balancing.  For example, if you get the power that lets you hire guys and make them immediately active, you can chain together way more turns than your opponents.  Still, the art is great and the storytelling is fun, so for now, we’re keeping this one.

**Bohnanza** (1x, 4p) – Such a great game. Everyone looks doubtful when we explain this game, but everyone seems to love it as soon as we get into the second or third round.  Huge fan.  Wondering if the expansions are good or kill the simplicity of it.

**Hanabi** (1x, 3p) – A pretty simple game but one that lends itself to some great teamwork, if you have the right players.  We typically wind up with a player who gives too much information out, but it’s all part of the game.  I think this time we scored “Excellent” – not too shabby. 

**Dungeon Petz** (1x, 3p) – First time trying this with more than 2 and the game holds up, as I fully expected it would. It’s great both player counts.  Every decision feels tough, and you’re constantly trying to outwit your opponents when it comes to assigning your imps and money into clusters. This is a seriously fantastic game.

**Troyes** (1x, 2p) – Another one of our favorites.  This game is just so clever, even if now and then the actions feel like they involve a step or two too many (something I ultimately don’t mind because of how rewarding the gameplay is).  There are so many great ways to use the dice and your workers, and it can feel tough as nails.  The mix of competitiveness and a bit of cooperation works incredibly well.

**13 Days** (2x, 2p) – Thanks again to /u/markbesada on this one! We tried this yesterday and accidentally forgot one of the rules, thereby ending the world in a dual-nuclear war on both sides, ending in a tied loss.  The second game went much better, and I barely squeaked away with a victory after guessing which of the three DEFCON track my SO had picked (she had all three as her potential agendas, and if I’d picked the wrong one, I would have lost by causing nuclear war again).  Awesome little mini-Twilight Struggle.  We’ll bust this one out a lot, I think!  That is, until you’re ready for it again, Mark :)

EDIT: Forgot to answer questions!

* My immediate family is mixed - dad is resistant to most games but mom is willing to try them, but not very good at following even the slightest complex rule set. We've gotten them hooked on Codenames, they enjoyed Karuba, and we're introducing more and more games as time goes on.

* Longest game is probably Through the Ages, BSG, Vinhos Deluxe or The Gallerist.  I can't think of many others we've played that went significantly beyond 4-5 hours.  Hoping to try an 18xx someday, however :)

Guys, I did it.  I really did it.  It just kind of happened.  I somehow got my wife hooked on board games.  For a while the entire list of board games she would play was Monopoly.  We would go to another couple's house and play Monopoly.  After a couple of brutal games, I got them to play **Forbidden Desert**.  After some success with that, I pulled out **King of Tokyo** and **Tokaido**.  Then the other couple got a copy of **Munchkin**.  I recently (this past week) introduced them to **Machi Koro: Bright Lights Big City** and they were hooked.  I jumped on the success of that, and pulled out **Dominion** and all of them loved it!  I also taught my wife **Carcassonne** this week and she didn't hate it.  My wife actually asked me this morning if it would be ok if the other couple came over tonight to play more board games!  It's great!

So for this week, I played, in no particular order:  
**Dominion**  
**Machi Koro: Bright Lights Big City**  
**Tokaido**  
**King of Tokyo**  
**King of New York**  
**Munchkin**  
**Carcassonne**


So to answer the first question, my wife is no longer a reluctant player.  We've played board games almost every day over the holiday weekend.

As for the longest game, it would probably be a 4+ hour game of 4 player risk.
**Arkham Horror LCG** Core campaign one time as a two player with my wife. Curse of the Rougarou standalone once as a two player with a friend, and once solo. This game has serious solo cred.

**Tides of Madness** twice as a time filler.

Six players **Sushi Go Party** three or four games. 

**7 Wonders Duel + Pantheon** expansion. One and a half times. That first half was botched because we missed a critical element of the new rules and  had to start it over. 

It was a good long weekend of boardgaming. 
**Pandemic: Legacy** x3 - Beat January and February, lost March.

**One Night Ultimate Werewolf** x11 - Got this to play with the extended family over the holiday and it was a huge success. Picked up Daybreak when it was on sale at Amazon yesterday, so we will be playing even crazier games of this during Christmas.

**Jaipur** x1 - Played a quick game while waiting for relatives to show up at our place. We didn't actually get to finish our game as we were at 1-1 when the family arrived. 

**Ticket to Ride: Europe** x1 - Got a touch more meatier than ONUW with the family. It was cuttroat and we all had a great time.


I play with my immediate family all the time. My SO is always willing to play. The kids can be hit-or-miss depending upon the game, but Pandemic Legacy has everyone itching to get dinner done and the table cleaned so we can start playing. 


My longest game has to be Axis & Allies back in the day. More recently Through the Ages was a long game that forced me to reevaluate what games I purchased to play with my SO. She fades approaching two hours and then she gets frustrated by her suboptimal play. 
**Codenames** (6-8p, 3x) - Firet I played this with a print and play version because the actual game wasn't coming till Friday. While it wasn't pretty, I still had fun and everyone that played said they liked it. Then on Friday we played with some of the same people and some new. Great fun all around.

**Dominion** (5p, 2x) - I was nervous about this one. I love Dominion but can see why people think it's a bit dry and boring. So I played this one with 4 siblings that have never played and they liked it a lot. A couple of them even said they're going to buy it so they can play at home. 

I'm not exactly sure what the longest game I've played is, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a ridiculously long game of Monopoly with 5-6 people.

Aside from that, I've found out that I'm kind of addicted to board games. I got 7 Wonders the same day Codenames came in, but didn't have time to play over the weekend. Now I'm looking to back Abandon Planet and ask for El Grande for my birthday. Also, it's really just a pipe dream, but I'd love Kingdom Death: Monster. That might happen someday, but for now I'm settling for runthroughs on YouTube.
Our weekly Sunday game day consisted of Kingdom Builder (first time and played twice), Suishi Go! (twice), Betrayal at House on the Hill (once), and The Hare and Tortoise  (once)!  

Betrayal is one of my groups favorite games and is played weekly.  Kingdom Builder was thoroughly enjoyed and will also become a staple!
This week I played:

**Inis**

Great game, really looking forward to trying it again.

**Space Alert**

Surprisingly have never played this before. Played 3 games in a row, really loved the chaos and craziness.

**Space Hulk: Death Angel**

First win in quite some time.

**Mechs Vs Minions**

What an amazing production. Beauty of a game and super fun.

**Cottage Garden**

Beautiful game that was fun and relaxing.
My wife's cousins brought a few games up to her aunt and uncle's on Thanksgiving, so we played **Tsuro** which was great, **Sushi Go** which was great and **Loot** which was very okay.
It was FATDOG on Friday, which of course is the annual Friday After Thanksgiving Day Of Gaming.

It started out with an 8-player "epic"-sized game of **Commands and Colors: Ancients**, Raphia scenario. My perfect plan was botched by my subordinates!

Then, I managed to pull off the rare loss as the Allies in the Columbia Games classic **Napoleon**.

After a very quick loss at **Flink**, we got 6 folks together for games of **Lifeboats** and **Ca$h 'n Gun$**. I died horribly in both games.

After that was a nice game of **The End of the Triumvirate**, which hit the table for the first time in close to a decade, I guess. It needs more play. I lost. The evening ended with a fun game of **Fuji Flush**. I lost.

None of my immediate family plays games, except on rare occasions.

I play war games, and I am pretty sure a full campaign game of **Ardennes '44** took 30+ hours, coming down to the last die roll. I lost.
This week:

* **The Voyages of Marco Polo** x1

* **Oceanos** x1

* **Concordia** x1

* **Dixit** x2

* **Happy Salmon** x2

* **Acquire** x1

* **Splendor** x1

Longest game I've ever played is probably some huge hairball conflict game from when I was in the kid in the 80s - either **Diplomacy**, **Samurai Swords**, **Risk**, **Titan**, or most likely, Avalon Hill's **Third Reich**. I've had multi-day sessions of all of the above.
Played **Eldritch Horror** this week for the first time and we lost.

What we got wrong:

* Investigators could take 2 move actions.
* In the first half of the game, we did not realize you had to pull an investigation card to gain the clue token, people just took them.
* We missed almost all the comet triggers on the monster tokens.
* During the first half, we lowered the Doom token for every open gate, every single Mythos Phase.

We played with 5 players and it took about 4 hours to complete the game. Most everyone still had an enjoyable experience. One person thought the die rolling made it to random and the Delay condition un-fun. Next time we play, I'm going to add some house rules to make it less random and punishing.

**Castles of Burgundy** (3p, 1x) - Had it on the shelf for a while. Didn't bring it out because my group is still relatively new to Euros. Played with the more experienced Euro-gamers yesterday and found the first few rounds confusing but we began to understand it when we reached Phase B/C. Will definitely try it out again this week.

**Pandemic** (4p, 1x) - Pulled it out on Thanksgiving and introduced it to two beginners. My other experienced friend and I "quarterbacked" the first few rounds but it only took a while for the two newcomers to understand the game.

**Codenames** (6p, 2x) - Classic game on Thanksgiving. I had an 8-yr old on my team (friend's cousin) and it was hard for me to come up with a hint that she can understand. Lost both games.
One day this weekend we played two games of **Titan** followed by two games of **Arkwright**, which at the time didn't seem quite as ridiculous as it does now.  Actually now that I've finally *played* Arkwright it seems much more approachable than the rules made it seem; I'm pretty sure I could teach it in 10-15 minutes.

We also played **Bamboleo** at Thanksgiving with a lot of non-gamers.  Boy do little kids love a game where things come crashing down.  We played loteria too (our hosts were Mexican), which isn't much of a game unless you're a little kid or you don't know Spanish, which is to say it was quite a game for most of us.

A bunch of two-player games of **Arboretum** and **Kaliko**, a game I dragged out because I just found a copy selling on ebay for $350 and thought, damn, I have that.  Kaliko is just as good, and just as bad, as I remembered:  there's a lot of luck of the draw, a lot of hopeless searching for opportunities, and a good player will *skunk* a bad one.  Arboretum seems to favor the player who draws all the 7s, though I suspect that the fact that I was a head four games to zero at the end indicates that failing to play defensively is not a very good idea.

And, of course, **A Feast For Odin**, though there's an asterisk next to my victory because I misinterpreted an occupation card (it's not "collect 8 silver if you have a longboat," it's "you may sell a longboat for 8 silver").

I don't spend a lot of time with my immediate family; the ones who are still alive are on the other side of the country from me and we seem to like it that way.  But I've certainly played a lot of games with them over the decades - I played **History of the World** with my mom and aunt, for instance, and **Acquire** was a staple in our family.

The longest game I've ever played at a single sitting was probably either **Civilization** or **1829** - both took more than 8 hours.  I also spent much of a summer playing the full game of **Terrible Swift Sword** when I was in high school, though the game got shunted to the side when, against all expectation, I got a girlfriend.
As expected, **Carcassonne** (winter edition) came out at the Thanksgiving table. I also turned my SO's relatives onto **Ticket to Ride**, by way of the 10th Anniversary Edition. I played a couple of quick games of **6 nimmt!** and met with some old friends for a game of **Pandemic: Rise of Cthulhu**. Overall not a bad few days. This week I hope to play **Arboretum** once it comes in the mail.

As for the questions: I don't really have much contact with my immediate family, even around the holidays, so it's mostly been my SO's family that we see on Thanksgiving and Christmas. They're mostly a card-playing group so it's been interesting showing them other things. They're pretty open to the experience, and have added some of the games I demoed to their regular "family gathering" rotation.

The longest game I played was an all-day run of **Talisman** one fourth of July. Thankfully we were all pretty sauced and it was mostly a social gathering so it didn't drag as much as it could have. It still lasted the better part of 6 hours though.
Started a new game of **Pandemic: Legacy** with my girlfriend. I've played through once but I got a cheap copy from MM a few weeks ago and she wanted to play! Played the first month and she almost cried when I told her to tear up a card, it's gonna be a good time.
For those who celebrated, I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving!


I played with my brother and SO after we filled up on food:

* **Sheriff of Nottingham** (3 players) - Seemed appropriate to talk about chickens, apple, cheese, and bread after dinner! This was actually an introduction to my SO and brother, so I was the only liar at the beginning, but they quickly got the hang of it, and suddenly, everybody's got contraband. My brother also because Lord of Cheese because he had 50 of them or something insane.



* **Pod-X** (3 players) - We tried out a kickstarted game that came in recently. The idea is the dealer knows the winning condition of the game (highest number in play or lowest number in your hand, etc.), so the rest of us have to watch what cards get played to try and figure out what the winning condition is. Very light game, but still interesting for only like 15 cards or so. I can see this being played in the future at a dinner table while we're waiting for food or something.


* **Flash Point** (3 players) - Ended the night with a co-op game. To win, we only needed to save seven people before the house burned down, so my brother was ready to call it quits after we saved the seven, but I knew there was still a dog left in the house, so I insisted that we played until we at least save the dog. The dog ended up being the LAST token we turned over, and we were able to save him just in time before the house was structurally unsound. VICTORY!


---------------------------------


* My immediate family live out of town, but I try to bring some games with me when we do meet up. My brother was the person who fully introduced me to board games and was in the hobby way before I was, so he's definitely down to play whenever. My parents have limited English, so it's harder to find a game for them, but we still make it work. I'm happy to also play the lighter games with them, like **Phase 10**.


* The longest game I've ever played was a 9-player game of **Eclipse**. I think we got 4-5 hours in, and it was only 75% of the game, but we were all hungry and wanted to grab dinner, so we just resolved everything then.
Week of a bunch of new-to-me games. Way too close to the holidays to be picking up new games but these were all pre-orders. I swear!

**Scythe** 3p game. It was only my 3rd game, and the first with more than 2p. Really like the increased tension at 3. I think we'll be including an Automa player for our 2p game. My friend picked it up pretty quickly but I was terrible at teaching it!  
**Great Western Trail** (1x2p learning game and 1 x 3p). I LOVE this game so far. Loads of buildings went up in the 3p game which made upgrading your movement really important. I, of course, went for upgrading my hand size before my movement and missed out on making another delivery. Still pulled out a win though! I think I like this more than Mombasa. It's much more straightforward and easier to teach. Can't wait to play this one to death!  
**Grand Austria Hotel** (2p learning game). Fun game but after playing Great Western Trail I was a bit underwhelmed. I think it will really open up once we pay more attention to making combos, but we were really just hitting buttons to see how it all worked.   
**Istanbul** (2p with the Mocha and Baksheesh exp). I forgot how much fun this game is! It was a nice, solid but somewhat forgettable game but the addition of the expansion really makes the 2p experience a lot more fun. Need to play this more often and keep an eye on the newest expansion.   
**Terraforming Mars** (3p game). We introduced this to a friend of ours and I smartened up and just used the Base corporations with one production of everything but including the Corporate era cards. Much easier to teach this way and my friend figured it out pretty quickly. I'm nowhere close to getting bored of this. I think it's my top game of 2016.  

I don't see my family too often (no drama, just distance) but I've been trying to get my one group of nieces and nephews into board gaming. They went nuts for Ticket to Ride, less so for Click Clack Lumberjack (ah, but just wait until they start drinking!) and I'll be causing some family discord by giving them Survive! for Xmas this year. My other sister's kids aren't as keen, but I tried hooking them with Lords of Waterdeep and SmallWorld. My one niece is a Catan addict at 11 years old so there's hope for her yet!

Longest game ever was Mage Wars. We loved that game but basically turtled most of that match. Not knowing the rules that well made it a 4 1/2 hour experience. Great game, but the time commitment to learn it well enough to significantly shorten the game time was too high for me and I traded it away. 
I played 3 games of **Great Western Trail**. Wow, this game lives up to the hype! I need to play it again soon, it's one of those games that has you thinking strategy hours later.
Most of the times it is just my wife and I playing. Her brother lives with us but will generally ruin games for me by not listening to rules or just doing what he wants, so I've stopped inviting him to play anything.

We had an arkham horror game run a couple of days mostly due to children need caring for. 



Mansions of Madness - We've played this game 10 times now and have yet to beat any campaign.

Terra Mystica - First play through, Games excellent shot straight to the top of my list.

Machi Koro - great easy game for people to play.

Temple of Elemental evil - Wife got me killed by exploring instead of fighting the monsters we already had. First run through died 3 tiles in. 

Tiny epic galaxies - This game was more complex than I thought it would be. Really got the wheels turning and loved it. Went ahead and kickstarted tiny epic quest.

Exploding kittens - had friends over with their kids everyone had a great time.


Splendor.  Every friend/family member I've gotten to play it, they usually turn around and buy it.  These are usually people who don't really play non-conventional board games.  You'd be surprised (or maybe not) as to how people are turned off because they stereotype the box art and label it "nerdy".  My family is closed-minded quite a bit. 

Once we play it and they get it, we'll play at least two more rounds.  Usually there will be one of the other three players who wants to play it even more.  I'm usually down for that!
- **Patchwork** (2p, 2x) - Played this some more with my fiancee and each time I appreciate the design a little more. She is great a Tetris and therefore tends to crush me here, but our scores are now consistently in the positive. Last game she beat me 18 to 11.

- **7 Wonders** (2p, 3x) - This game was one of my first purchases a couple of years back, but has sat mostly unplayed until this past weekend. However, I had a realization that the much-maligned dummy player in 2p games is actually quite brilliant. My fiancee turned the dummy into a money-making machine and absolutely crushed me in two straight games.

- **Pandemic** (3p, 2x) - Another popular game that never grabbed me, this time I played with experienced people at a pub on the Heroic difficulty (6 Epidemic cards). We lost the first game after curing 3 diseases, as we got like 6 consecutive yellow cards which triggered 3 outbreaks. In our second game we won on the very last turn (there were no more player cards to draw). I'd like to mess around with the expansions and eventually get **Pandemic Legacy**.
_______________________________________________
- I play almost exclusively with my fiancee, but we try to get the rest of our family into it. **Ticket to Ride**, **Codenames**, and **Splendor** are about as a heavy as they'll get, but that's ok!

- I recently played an agonizing 4-hour game of **Munchkin**, and I will probably never play that game again. The cards just happened to space out so that everyone was at level 9 for a solid 1.5 hours. I only won because I pulled a Divine Intervention card as a Cleric, which is one of the few level-boosting cards that actually does get you to level 10.

Munchkin is the game equivalent of an American Idol star that doesn't realize his 15 minutes of fame have been over for years. It really left a bad taste in my mouth.
Got a good amount of gaming in this week, culminating at Friendsgiving where we played practically all day.

**Kemet** - Played at a local meetup. My buddy scored a grand total of 12 points, and we were playing the short game (8 pts)! Teaching the game (and playing for the first time) went well, the game is quite accessible and intuitive. It's a keeper.

**Hey, That's My Fish!** - Cute filler, with room for aggressive counter play, but I think the 2005 Mayfair box is too large. No real negatives for me, it's a nice light abstract.

**Modern Art** - This game is edging out **Ra** for my favorite Knizia auction game, and I think it has to do with the group. We would do our best Ira Glass impression and make little speeches (sometimes lewd) about each painting we were pawning off.

**Fairy Tale** - Sushi-Go with a bit more bite. I love the fantasy theme and anime art style.

**Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective** - Oh man, we mucked this up so bad. We got the completely wrong suspect, and we followed three times as many leads as Holmes. It was a great experience and I'm looking forward to case 2.

**Space Alert** - We picked this up right at the end. We found a groove as a group and we're able to get through the Tutorial missions well. I'll be adding the Internal Threat track in our next session.

**Hanabi** - Got heated on this one.
* **Small World** - 3 players. First time playing with **Be Not Afraid**, so I shuffled the regular races and powers and then shuffled to force the new stuff into the top 10 spots. I dominated the early game with Mechant Barbarians--18, 20, and 18 points for turns 2, 3, and 4, The other two came back a bit, but I think the game ended at something like 61/69/108 in my favor.
* **Resistance** - 3 games, I think, with 5 players each. First time playing since picking up **Hidden Agenda**, so we used the Commander and Assassin in the first two games and Blind Defectors in the third.
* **Mechs vs Minions** - Played with only half of our normal crew, so we did a custom scenario. We set up the 1st mission, but with three random tiles in a line instead of just the two. 4 players; half being brand new to the game. The game took *forever*, because one of the players decided he wanted to handle moving the bomb, but took about a dozen turns to leave the school.
* **Pathfinder Adventure Card Game** - Wrath of the Righteous, Sword of Valor, scenario 4. We started with a really scary first turn; our Alain (Cavalier) immediately encountered the villain, Staunton Vhane, and then immediately went for the check to defeat before we had a chance to talk about helping out. Things went poorly. Had to make liberal use of Adowyn's evade-summoned-banes ability to avoid the succubus, too, but we made it through in the end. My Seoni picked up a Dismissal spell, so that was pretty awesome.
* **Secret Hitler** - 3 games. First had 10 players, but someone was too drunk to keep going and left halfway through. Second and third were back to 10. I was a facist the first game and a liberal the second and third. First game ended in my favor with Hitler getting elected. Second game, we figured out a few liberals very quickly and just rejected one whole side of the table, leading to a liberal win. Third game was similar, but our "confirmed liberals" included one fascist. We still managed to win, because we drew the one liberal policy in the ~9 remaining cards.
* **Under My Bed** - 2 games; 4 and then 6 players. I won the first, as the kid. Second game dragged on a bit ("dragged on" meaning like 10 minutes total) because people were too tired to remember everything. Kid won that one, too. Both times it was a successful guess at what was under the bed.
* **Dead Last** - ~5 games with ~7 players? Very fun. My favorite part was using clues that I knew only a few people would get--"When I mention Ysera, what color do you think of?" "What color is a Warcraft dark elf's skin?"

For the questions:

* I play more often with my siblings than with anyone else. My parents and most of my siblings live ~30 minutes away from me, so I head over there every week or two. It helps that there are a bunch of them (6 living with my parents right now) and they're all into gaming of some form or another.
* Mage Knight, both in terms of play time and in terms of time between start and end--playing it split up over the course of a week.
My group was down a body so we tried out some new games this week. 

Played smash up, castles of mad king Ludwig and mansions of madness. 

Now it was the first time playin mansions and the intro mission said it would take 60-90 minutes. Somehow we started at 10 and it lasted to 1am. 

We weren't really delaying our turns or anything but somehow it lasted for a long time. But it was a very engaging cooperative game and would definitely like to keep trying the other scenarios and expansions. 
**Pandemic** - 1x4p - My aunt is an epidemiologist and plays this game solo EVERY DAY. She naturally brought it to Thanksgiving and it had been a long time since I played it, so I joined her. She's so sweet and fun that you almost miss how hard she quarterbacks that game. But we had fun and won with onyl 2 research centers on the board, and my little sister as Scientist cured 3 of the diseases, which made her feel good. Fun game! I want to try the Cthulhu variant.

**Concordia** - 1x4p - I introduced that same aunt as well as my older brother and my oldest brother-in-law to Concordia. My second time playing. The game went a bit slow as everyone tried to wrap their heads around it (the game's only real weakness is no clear long-term goal, IMO) but we had a great time, and all agreed it was fun not knowing who was REALLY winning until the scoring round at the end. My aunt won by a huge margin, and I lost by a similarly huge margin (painted myself into a corner early on with colonies in Brittania, and too much focus on card buying). Good times. 

**Splendor** - 3x4p, 2x2p, 1x3p - Easily the most played game over this weekend. I'm a little burnt out on it now. The puzzle never gets old and I love teaching this to new people because they always enjoy the hell out of it, but it's time for a new gateway game soon.

**7 Wonders Duel** - 1x2p - Played with my brother in law. I walked away with twice the victory points and felt bad because it was his first time playing it, but he admitted he was focusing on the science and military cards while I got all the guilds and 4 wonders without much trouble. This game is a blast, but is always over before I feel like I've really tasted it. Going to buy the expansion soon!

**Space Hulk: Death Angel** - 1x3p - Brought this game to play solo at my brother's house because I anticipated having nothing to do but Reddit and drink coffee. He surprised me by asking if he could play, and so did my wife (she's played with me before). It took a bit long because he was new to the game and we discussed the hell out of every strategic option, but we won the game with 9 marines alive! A great game, always happy to break it out.

**Ascension: Apprentice Edition** - 1x1p - Tried out the solitaire rules, which I somehow didn't even know existed in Ascension until this week despite owning and loving the game for like 2 years. Anyways I lost, 100-115. Will play again, though!

Games I wanted to play but didn't get a chance: Coup, Condottiere, Epic, Codenames, Game of Thrones LCG 1stEd, Dominion, Carcassonne.
_____________________________________________________

By 'immediate family' I'll mean my wife, I guess, although I do visit nearby siblings and my parents pretty often too. I play a lot of board games with them all, as we grew up relying on them for social entertainment - lots of neighborhood friends and cousins and not a lot of yard space or sports equipment. My wife and I play 3-4 board games a week, I play with family on visits probably 2 or 3 out of every 5 visits.

Longest game I've played is probably original **Risk**, which I begged for as a young teen and loved, although we rarely finished. Instead we'd set a time limit and try to have the majority score by then. This answer would be **Axis & Allies** if we had ever got past the setup phase.
**Forbidden desert** we lost miserably. 

I also went to a miniature con/tournament. I've never played anything like this but it was nice seening people play. I couldn't stay long watching people play as my son wanted to play as well.

So they were running some introduction session. And we played two games of a very simplified game. Simple mouvement and combat rules. I was playing soldiers and my son a necromancer trying to spawn Zomies and sceleton. He picked up the game really fast and now I thinking of getting **mice and mystic**.
**Glory to Rome**: Got to play a few 3 and 5 players games of this over the holiday weekend/break with the family. It's very interesting how different game at different player counts

**Age of War** and **LotR: Journey to Mordor**: A couple of simple filler dice games. I was actually mildly impressed by how different **LotR** was considering I had no faith in FFG make their dice games unique in some way.

**Lord of the Rings: LCG**: Finished up the last few APs from the Dreamchaser cycle as well as the entire Sand of Harad expansion. Always good stuff from Matt and Caleb. I can't wait to dig into the Haradrim cycle. Flame of the West is still looming over my brother and I and our Saga campaign, however.

**Schotten Totten**: I got a box of the new IELLO print and have already put about 50+ plays into it. It really is the perfect mix of strategy without being too heavy, but also quick enough to where you can play a lot of games back-to-back-to-back. If you play lots of games 2-player with your wife/husband/significant other/gaming partner and you currently do not own **Schotten Totten**, you should probably pick up a copy. It's under $15 on Amazon right now and could probably make a great stocking stuffer.

Questions:

* Thankfully, I actually get to play games with my immediate family a lot. My brother is pretty much into a lot of the same games as I am, but especially the LCGs. We've done pretty much every **LotR:LCG** quest together and he is constantly thinking about new decks and combos. He is less of a fan of worker placement Euro games, but will play them on occasion. I end up playing a larger number of my games with my mom, as I live close by, and she really likes a number of the games in my collection, but especially some of the harder Euros like **Agricola**, **A Feast for Odin**, **Terra Mystica** etc. She's a big fan of **Scythe** as well. Most of the new games I get I test out with her first to make sure I have the rules down and understand how to teach the game. My dad is the person who is least into games in my family, and he prefers simpler games like **Age of War**, **Schotten Totten**, **Karuba**, **Thurn und Taxis**, **Carcassonne**, but will occasionally branch out and play things like **Glory to Rome** with us. He has also played **Twilight Struggle** with me on occasion, as he finds the historical nature of the game interesting. He says he finds the historical theme of games like  **TS**, **Wir Sind das Volk**, and the COIN series fascinating from an academic perspective and likes how these games blend complex historical events and distill them down into gameplay mechanics.

* The longest game I've ever played in a single sitting was my first game of **Twilight Struggle** which took about 2.5 to 3 hours. I generally try to get or play games that end pretty much around the 60 to 75 minute mark, or have an easy way to "pause" the game to be played at a later date, like between Eras in **TS**.

I finally got to go home for Thanksgiving break, since I live so far from home. As such, I got to play a lot of games with my family.


**Betrayal at House on the Hill** - I picked up the Widow's Walk expansion last week, which I finally got to play on Saturday. Myself and three of my cousins ended up playing through a scenario where we are all interns in a company- last man standing gets the job. The oldest cousin playing ended up winning cause all of the rest of us went insane. Woo!

**Codenames** - I got the chance to introduce my nuclear family to this game. It took a while to get mom on the same page, but we got going eventually. We played three games, with my team winning once. There were several rounds where I missed a word on the board that fit into my hint and was on the other team's list, so that was great.

**Catan with Seafarers** - I also picked up Seafarers and its 5-6 player expansion last week. We played three games over the weekend, with my sister, mom, and brother winning. All three seemed to run into a problem with us producing resources. The most ludicrous example was the third game. At one point, literally all five players only had sheep and wheat, and in ridiculous amounts as well. Nobody got a seven for a very long time, and when it did finally get rolled, we all discarded at least 6 cards each. I discarded 9.

Some of my nuclear family is fine with games, though my mom tends to start complaining if the game seems complex or like it will drag on. My extended family is fairly wishy-washy- I have to show them the right game to get them interested. Regardless, I enjoy playing with them as we tend to find ourselves in ridiculous situations.




**Vast** 1x4p With TTS on sale, quite a few of my friends picked it up so we finally got to try Vast. I played cave. I think we ended up misinterpreting a few rules since we were kinda tired. Game ended up super close, I lost because I pointed out to another player how they could prevent me from winning (though I'm pretty happy I didn't, I feel like cave winning isn't exciting for a first game). Dragon won. 

**Love Letter** ~10x, 3/4p. Visited my home town and was to surprised to see my sister, who tends to dislike boardgames, had gotten this. Played quite a lot of this.

**Coup** ~10x 4p. Met up with some old friends and went to a board game bar. They haven't played much modern games, and they wanted lying and bluffing, so I suggested this and it was a huge hit. I think I won twice.

**Sheriff of Nottingham** 1x4p. Same group with coup, I suggested it after we got played coup for awhile, since they seemed to like the bluffing. Fell pretty flat, I still don't care for this game. I'm not gonna suggest it again. I think I won, but we didn't really care by the time scoring came around.

**Patchwork** 1x2p. First time either of us played. Fun, but surprisingly stressful. I won by ~10. I'm looking forward to playing again

**Terra Mystica** 1x3p. Played as swarmlings. We messed up a bunch of scoring through out the game, and since we were all within 10 at the end, it really could've been anyone's game.
Played games with my cousins over Thanksgiving (and one game with my older sister). It was really fun, as I've moved my cousins out of gateway territory.

**Puerto Rico** 3p: I brought this home last Christmas and played with three of my cousins, and they had asked to borrow it overnight so they could play it again. So I brought it back, but only two of them were around when we decided to play it. It was different than our previous games, as I think they learned that being the person that picks the craftsman frequently puts you at a disadvantage. I ended up winning by a decent margin due to getting the Guild Hall and Fortress for a lot of points. This game has really stood the test of time. Now if only I could afford a copy of the 10 year anniversary edition.

**Trick of the Rails** 3p: One cousin left to go deer hunting, so my sister jumped it. First time playing this after receiving it about a month ago from the kickstarter. This game is great. As the game went on, I kept realizing all the ways in which I had screwed up (and continued to screw up). A great filler, trick-taking game.

**The Game** 2p: My sister left, and while we waited for another cousin to show up, the oldest of my cousins and I played a round of this. I think this was only the second time we've succeeded in getting rid of all the cards. I think the other time was also with 2 players. Having to check the rulebook for hand size really showed me how little German I remember.

**Terraforming Mars** 3p: played this with the oldest and youngest of my cousins (22 and 12). The 12 year old didn't have much trouble with the game. A few cards were confusing to him, but nothing that kept him from playing. This was my second time playing, the first time with 5 players. I don't think the 3 player game was much shorter. Overall I lost by 1 point to my 22 year old cousin, with the 12 year old about 10 points behind. The 12 year old said this was his favorite of all the games he's ever played.

**Among the Stars** 3p: Same cousins as before. I've only played once before, over a year ago, but it was easy enough to remember. They had both played a bunch of 7 Wonders, so drafting was pretty simple. I ran away with this game with an engine of blue rooms generating a lot of points.


Questions:

* My 22 year old cousin goes to college near where I live, so he's a semi-frequent attendee at my game days. Otherwise I mainly play with my cousins when I'm home for the holidays, as I've turned several of them into gamers, ranging in age from 12 to 22. Growing up I would play cards with my grandparents, and some party games at holidays.

* Longest game? Probably about 6 hours for **Mage Knight** or 5 hours for **Through the Ages**. I play a lot of 2-3 hour games, but it is harder to get people for long games.
**C&C: Ancients** tried out our first game, first scenario. Syracuse thundered back after a slow start and won the game 5 banners to 4. We got some of the rules wrong at the start when battling, took us nearly the entire game to realize a few charts is basically all you need to play the game. Took us about 2 hours to finish up, should be a more enjoyable experience now that we know how to play it better.

**Arctic Scavngers** played a few 2 player games of this with a new player, I can't get enough of this game right now.

**Mage Knight the Board Game** 2p, Conquer and Hold scenario with PvP rules. As always, it was awesome. I've got quite a few games of MK under my belt, but it was the first time I played with PvP and MAN it was hard. The rules are so complicated and the strategy even more so. It was tiring, I must admit, but still awesome fun as every Mage Knight game.

**Ghost Stories** on iPad, solo. I actually play this many many times every week solo (every time I have to use the potty =P ). I usually play with two monks (green and yellow) on hell difficulty, choosing the monks' abilities and tile setup. It is still freakishly hard. I've got a 15% win rate on this game.

**Keyflower** 4p. First time playing this. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. A nice euro with original mechanics, but other similar options appeal more to me.

**Kanagawa** 3p. Another game I enjoyed more than I thought I would. Nice relaxing game with beautiful art. I don't like set collection games usually but this one was okay. The "bamboo" playmat is a complete joke. I was expecting something that at least looked like real bamboo but what I get is a beach mat for leprechauns. The most annoying thing about this game though is that THERE IS NO FREAKING TIE BREAKER! I hate the "share the victory" shenanigan which sadly had to happen...

**Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second Edition** 4p. Not sure about the mission since the owner and overlord was the one who prepared it. It was my 3rd time playing this game and, although I try really hard, I can't seem to like it. =(
I played Hero Quest when I was a kid and have fond memories of it, specially the exploration aspect of the game, which is not present in most modern dungeon crawlers. I love fantasy and RPG-esque themes. Does anyone have a suggestion on awesome dungeon crawlers with exploration similar to Hero Quest but more up to date? I can tell you some I already know and/or don't like: Mice and Mystics (the story book kind of ruins the surprises...), Shadows of Brimstone (GOD, what an awful game. I haven't played it but have watched a gameplay video.), Level 7 Omega Protocol, Mansions of Madness 1st edition (I'm looking forward to playing the 2nd edition since it's true exploration with none of the map pre revealed).
I've heard you can play Descent 1st edition without revealing the map beforehand and I'm waiting on a friend to be the overlord for us one day. I'm excited, but I've never heard anyone mention the 1st edition. Thoughts?

**Attack on Titan: Deckbuilding Game** 4p. This was awesome more because of the goofiness of my group while playing it than the actual game itself haha. Everytime someone did a card combo or killed a titan, someone would start singing the anime song and move the character standee around the titan as if it was an epic kill. It turned into an "inside meme" and the song was in my head till the next day. Tons of laughs while playing this.
It's a nice deck builder with a good deal of theme. Not really a must play for fans of the anime/manga, but definitely one I would recommend.

**Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization** 3p. Man this game is awesome. I played a couple games online this week and also once the physical version for the second time. This revised edition is simply beautiful. Playing the physical game was a bit disappointing because recalculating military strength everytime something changed was a big pain in the ass, so I kind of got bummed down that the conclusion was that playing it online was better... It's still an awesome game and I would definitely play the physical game again, but handling the control of the numbers over to a machine is really relevant in this game. Maybe it works better in the peaceful variant?

**Clank!** 3p. Second time playing this and it's absolutely awesome! It's not getting too much hype AFAIK, but it certainly should. The thrill of the race and of the hope that your cubes don't come out of the bag and instead your opponents' do is so awesome. Very exciting and fun.

**Champions of Midgard** 3p. A tweaked Lords of Waterdeep.... kinda.... I love worker placement and this was no different. Nothing too special about it but I though it was cool. Only first time playing it but my impression is that some leaders are way better than others.

**Fabled Fruit** 3p. We only played one game and so it was until the 7th card I believe. It was pretty meh IMHO and I don't see how it can improve much further even with new mechanics as you go through the deck of cards in further games. But I don't know, I could be proven wrong.

EDIT: Most of these were played with user lcg3092 who also posted his thoughts here in this thread =)
I played **Grand Austria Hotel** and it just so... Euro. I usually love Eurogames, but the downtime was insane. I could spend 10 minutes not doing anything if I was the first player. Hated it for that reason. With 4 players it took nearly 3 hours. The worst part was that two players were crushing it (they had played before) so after 90 minutes the other two were so far behind they couldn't win. Playing a game for 90 minutes that you can't win is not fun.
  
Longest game I have played was the first game of **Rebellion**. But I grabbed it for that reason as a friend was recovering from surgery.
**Quadropolis** Close game. 3 players, I lost. **Scythe** Another close 3 player game which I also ended up being the bottom of the barrel in. 
**Mage Knight** - (2p) To me, an Euro cosplaying as an Ameritrash, and overall a great game. Played the very competitive mode of 'king of the hill', where you have to keep control of the keeps and mage towers of the map. First time playing with the PvP combat. and while it can be a bit convoluted at times, I didn't disliked it as I thought I would, though unless we are playing a very competitive mode, I think I would rather play without it. 7 hours went by and we barely noticed it...

**Key Flower** - (4p) Nice worker placement, though I can't say it left a huge impression on me, I would play it again.  It has an interesting mechanic when it comes to workers, which can quickly lead to big differences of how many workers each player has in the beggning of a round, but that situation can just as quickly reverse, and it doesn't have that huge of an impact as you would expect from a worker placement game. The randomized action spaces you draw each round during the game will be just a fraction of the total available, so there's some replayability value there, but I'm not sure how many were left out. To me it looses some points for being a overall symmetric game, but I don't mind it that much, Asymmetric games can be very hard to pull off correctly.

**Mystic Vale** - (4p) I love deck building, so obviously I would love this game. It's concept is very interesting, and I look forward for other gamers venturing in it, though I have to agree with a grievance brought up by another player, that the special actions performed by the cards overall are not that creative or inventive. There is some truth to it, but it's still has some diverse special actions, and a few cool interactions (mainly cards with the guardian symbol), and it does involve some strategy thinking on how you build your deck, though the drawing mechanic makes me think that clearing cursed/ getting growth will always be a premium strategy, since no matter how bad your  deck is, if you can play 12-20 cards while the others only 6-10, you'll probably come out winning.

**Hit'z Road** - (4p) Fun filler (FYI, I have a VERY loose concept of filler) with some good flavor to it. Always fun to see your friends getting eaten by zombies, or doom the whole group by inflating the bid values.

**Luna** - (3p) Intersting "worker placement", I'm not sure I would call it a worker placement since you can only perform the actions your workers are already on (there is a pre determined worker placement at the start of the game which is asymmetric), after  that you have to take measures to move your workers around before the next round, so that they begin the round at the action islands you wish to take (or have a bunch of boats). It isn't as planning heavy as you would think, as every island has it's uses, and some actions can be performed on any island (though there are small differences depending on the island you are performing it on). The big strategy perhaps comes with the temple, where you have to carefully place your workers inside, but also protect them from being expelled from other people workers coming afterwards...

**Through the Ages: aNSoC** - (3p) Amazing game, it might be just better off online, it's a shame really... Don't get me wrong, if people want to play it, I will, but it can get messy sometimes, especially the military, which can come from 9 different types of sources (Units,tatics,techs,wonders,territories,leaders,governments,urban buildings and pacts), and some types of sources have multiple cards adding to it. Overall I'm spoiled by the fast, easy and mistake proof online playing, and am really hyped about the new app coming up (though I still don't know if it will be available for andriod, I hope it will)

**Clank!** - (3p) Love this deck building game. Still to find a deck building game that I didn't enjoy, but this one is close to the top of my list, though not for the deck building itself. To me the best part of this game is the non deck building part, or the main thing you do with your deck, which is exploring the dungeon and gathering treasures. Overall a great experience, though it might not be as strategic as I wish it was, there is some big strategic decisions, like which path to take, but most of the time you'll be doing what the cards allow you to do, and very often the choices will be pretty obvious, both on where to move and what cards to buy (there are very few interactions between the cards in your deck). There were a few moments where I had to take "big" decisions where I were torn between a few options, but they didn't happen as often.

**Fabled Fruit** - (3p) Interesting concept, but we only played one game, and the first game, I must say, is pretty shallow in strategy. But don't misunderstand me, this is the idea of the game, if you are not aware, this game is kinda like a legacy game, where you'll run though a deck of cards providing the actions allowed each round, and as you play more and more games, actions will be removed and others will be added, along with new mechanics (close to the end of our game the market was introduced, we didn't even had a chance to use it). There is some potential there, but with just one game I just couldn't get to it. Not saying the first game was bad, it was fun, as good as most fillers out there, just saying it might have the potential to have some real depth, which I didn't get to see.

**Champions of Midgard** - (3p) Nice worker placement, and while the other players disagreed with me on this, I still feel it kinds feels the niche of Lords or Waterdeep, and I think I prefer the latter

**Kanagawa** - (3p) Fun and beautiful filler, with some interesting choices to be made throught the game. Though there were some problems with turn order since to avoid wasting time we didn't wait for the previous guy to finish placing their paintings to then keep playing. That lead to some iffy moments, but that's our fault, not the game's.


I ended up playing boardgames 3 different moments this week, two of them pretty board intensive. And yes, I have a problem, and yes, I am unemployed and currentely with very few classes, stop judging  me...

As to the two last questions, I did try playing some boardgames with my family, and it went well most times, but they just don't seem that interested. And longer game must be wither TtA or Mage Knight, though I think the prize goes to the latter with a bit over 7 hours

EDIT: Actually had a game of Mage Knight with 3p that lasted 9 hours, and it was one of the short game modes...But it was mostly one of the players fault
Got several this week due to the holidays.

**Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)** x3 - We were able to finish the first campaign and are ready to move on to the next expansion.  :)

**Evolution: Climate** x3 - Introduced this game to several people this week.  There will be plenty more plays in the future.  We love this game!

**The Red Dragon Inn: Battle for Greyport** x3 - We finally got a chance to play with more than 2 players.  It's definitely better with more players!  If you play this game solo or with 2 players I'd recommend playing with *at least* 4 heroes total.  It's really much more fun with more heroes/players.  It's crazy hard though!

**Fate of Akalon: Tribes** x2 - Introduced it to a few new players.  This is a fun game that changes the way it feels with each player count.

**Battle Yahtzee: Deadpool** - My brother-in-law got this game and wanted to try it out.  It's horrible.  haha

**The Opulent** - We backed the KS and got this game a few weeks ago, but didn't have the time to learn the game until the holiday break.  The rule book is pretty dense, but it's actually really easy to learn.  It's tough to get the win conditions (as most cooperative games are "hard"), but is fun and thematic along the way.

**Pandemic Legacy: Season 1** - My group finally completed the campaign.  I'm so happy it's over.  We did not enjoy this game.  I probably won't play a legacy game ever again.  It wasn't *horrible*, but definitely "meh" - way over hyped, imo.

**Riftwalker: A Storm Hallow Card Game** - We backed the KS and got a chance to learn/play this week.  My wife and I are not fans of abstract games and we didn't enjoy it.  Having said that, I would recommend it to anyone who does like abstract games.  It's got a pretty fun concept to it...and only one portion is abstract.  I don't like that I don't like this game.  :(

**Tiny Epic Kingdoms** - I backed this KS to get the 10 pack as stocking stuffers.  We kept one for ourselves, of course.  I really like this game.  We introduced this game to a few people this week and they liked it too.  :)

My wife and I are proud to be child free and have a ton of opportunity enjoy the hobby.  We travel the country/world to attend gaming conferences (and other touristy stuff).  In that sense we definitely do share the same interest.  

We also play regularly with my parents.  We play with my sister occasionally, but she just had a baby and has now become really lame when the baby is around (she's still awesome when she isn't with the baby, however).  When we can get my sister away from her baby she enjoys playing though.

When I was young I played a very long game of **Risk** with my cousins.  We played it off and on for several weeks over the course of a summer.  I'd guess it was probably about 20 hours - but I hated every second of it.

In recent memory, the longest game was probably **Mage Knight**.  I played a solo game after I first started learning the game it took about 4 hours because I had to reference the rules so much.  I do like the game, but I don't know if I'll play it much anymore (or ever again) as I actively try to avoid games that last more than about 2.5 hours.

**Scuttle!** - 5 x 2p. A fine game, but definitely pretty simple. Played with all the kickstarter expansions. Not sure how I feel about the diseases, they make the game a bit too much like Fluxx.

**Defenders of the Realm (TTS)** - 1 x 3p. My first multiplayer game with Tabletop Simulator, and I liked it quite a bit. Definitely some issues getting in the swing of things, but we successfully played a full game.

I'm hoping to use TTS to test out Kingdom Death: Monster, so if anyone has tips or suggestions for that, I'd love to hear them.

--------

I play games a decent amount with them, and they are generally enthusiastic based on the game. Codenames, Camel Up, Concept are all great, but I have to avoid bringing things like Carcassonne and Cosmic Encounter because of the theme or art. 

The longest game I've ever played was a game of Dominant Species with an incredibly AP person. 4 players, lasted about 6 or 7 hours. Was pretty fun, but way too long.
So I am new to the hobby and I have a group of friends who are pretty keen to try games out with me. I have what I feel are a nice mix of gateway games.

This week (or really last night) we played Tsuro twice which went down as a pleasant little strategy game, everyone enjoyed it, everyone seemed happy to play more. after we moved onto Legendary Encounters: Alien, this was the main course and it went down a blast, we played the first movie and it was a super tight battle, I thought we were dead but we pulled it back at the end. Super engaging throughout, everyone loved the game overall. We ended with Lords of Waterdeep and while everyone enjoyed the mechanics it was noted that the game was a little dry, which I would agree with but am probably going to grab the expansion for to maybe add a little more flavour.

Overall solid night.
We played Deep Sea Adventure last night. Once we got the rules figured out it was a pretty fun game. It will make it to the table as a filler as often as possible. Other than that my house has been taken over by Pokémon Sun and Moon so I was on my own for games and played Hostage Negotiator a few times. 
**Terraforming Mars** (2x solo, 1x 2p): I love this game. It's my new go to solo game. I also played a game with my son, his first time, and he beat me as usual by ten points. He's just so good at these types of games. He thought it was great and looks forward to playing again. I think it took us ~2hrs to play.

**Viticulture** (1x, solo): Just bought it last week and got it to the table for a learning game. Turns out it's a fantastic solo experience and I can see myself playing it this way often. Plus I saw that there is a campaign of sorts at the end of the rule book that I'll have to check out. The Automa cards are a great and offer a good challenge. Looking forward to introducing this game to my wife soon. She's a big fan of **Lords of Waterdeep** and this game feels like it might be a nice step up for her. I have the Tuscany expansion already but I'm going to wait till I get a few plays of the base game before trying it.

**Biblios** (1x, 3p): Arrived at my FLGS a little early for game night and three of us decided to play this while we waited for others to arrive. A solid filler and easy to teach.

**Dominion** (1x, 4p): Always a classic. We hadn't played in a while but have never tired of the base game (we don't have any expansions). My wife flew under the radar and my sons were completely surprised when the points were tallied up.

**Patchwork** (1x, 2p): My wife and I sat down for what is probably our favourite 2p only game that we own. It plays fast and offers a nice challenge. She loves to knit, sew and crotchet so the theme is also very appealing to her. I won by quite a margin and she finished in the minuses for the first time in a long time.

**Castle Panic** (1x, 2p): Played with my 6 year old daughter. She really is getting good at playing more advanced games.

**Escape: Curse of the Temple** (3x, 2p): Another game my daughter just can't get enough of. Although we do play with the sand timer because she finds the music too scary.

**A Feast For Odin** (1x, 2p): My ten year old son is generally not into board games but this game intrigued him when he saw me playing it recently. I thought it might be too much for him but once we started playing, I realised that it really isn't a hard game to play. Before long he understood most of the mechanics and was able to take a turn without much help. He wasn't playing with any strategies, and we didn't count any points at the end of the game, but he loved being able to do so many different things and was engaged the entire time. He was all smiles afterward having played a heavier game with Dad, and said that he would love to play again sometime.

**Arkham Horror: The Card Game** (1x, 3p): My friend brought his copy to our weekly meetup and I got to try it with more then 2 players. After 4 plays I can say that I'm willing to invest in this game for the foreseeable future. We replayed the first scenario on regular difficulty and easily won. The game scales well, and the length and difficulty of the first scenario provides a great teaching game.

Questions:

- I play games with my immediate family all the time. A couple share the same interest in the hobby and only one person is a reluctant participant.

- I made the mistake of trying to learn **Mage Knight** with three other new players. It must have gone on for at least 6-8 hours over a couple of sessions. I was fairly new to the hobby and didn't realise that games could be this complex. It didn't ruin the game however, and it has gone on to be my absolute favourite.
**Play All The Games** checking in once again.  Here is the link to the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4z0ioz/what_did_you_play_this_week_aug_15_aug_21/d6rzgcs/) which I will include going forward.  Additionally, here is a [link to last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5e47re/what_did_you_play_this_week_nov_14_nov_20/da9lf0g/) if you want to slowly go back in time.  Played a decent number of games over the holiday weekend, but only a few qualified (either my wife wasn't there, or it was a game owned by a friend).

Game 34 - **Pit** - 5 players - This is a Thanksgiving and vacation classic for my family.  I played one time when one of my cousins was pretty young.  She had to go to bed earlier, but the rest of us stayed up and played Pit.  She woke up the next morning and asked why we were playing a game where everyone just yelled small numbers at each other.  It is a silly game, but definitely a blast with the right people.  We don't use the bull/bear cards and generally don't both keeping score.

Game 35 - **Bohnanza** - 4 players - This is definitely my favorite trading game.  It is always a little tricky for new players to not rearrange their hand and to always take a card from the front, but my parents (both new) picked up pretty quickly.  Understanding when to offer the farm for a trade and when to screw someone and forcing them to uproot and then plant something that could have been lucrative are keys to this game.  My dad ended up winning which is a rarity for him, so that was pretty fun to see!

Game 36 - **One Night Ultimate Vampire** - 5 players - We actually had 8 total people play, but 5 was the max at any given time.  This was the first time we have played this at all.  I'd say that almost everyone that participated is a ONUW veteran, so it wasn't actually too tricky for any of us to pick up.  There is definitely more going on in Vampire than Werewolf, but it never felt overly fiddly.  The marks were interesting and I would like to try this with a slightly higher player count (7+ ideally).  We only used the Count, Vampire, Priest, Copycat, Assassin, Marksman, Gremlin, and Pickpocket.  Some of the other roles sound interesting and it could be fun to even try an "ultimate battle" including roles from ONUW.

***********

I mostly play games with family.  My wife is my primary gaming partner and my parents and sister are up for it when we see them.  The in-laws will sometimes participate, but they are usually pretty reluctant to try anything new.  My brother in-law and his wife are converts and have started their own collection which is one of my prouder moments.

Longest game I've played was a 5 hour slog of **Joan of Arc**.  I wasn't a big fan of the game, despite it being ridiculously close the whole way.  The ending was exciting, but the game was just far too long for the level of enjoyment.  Coincidentally, the shortest "long game" I've played was a 45 minute session of **Game of Thrones** (including AFFC expansion).
**One Night Ultimate Werewolf** x5 - Played it with a new group. It's always a bit hard for people to pick up the first round but it's really easy to get the hang of after that. Really enjoying it and I'm starting to get a sense on all of the roles in the original so I'm looking forward to mixing it up with Daybreak. 

**Codenames Pictures** x4 - After having played this a bit more I think that I prefer the original. Pictures seems to be preferred by others though and I don't mind playing it at all. It does seem like it's going to have a lot of depth and therefor more longevity though.

**Coup** x2 - I've had this for a while but never gotten around to playing it so I was happy when the host of a board game meet up brought it out. I was god awful at it but I think I'll really enjoy this game. 

**Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu** x2 - I played this twice with my gf this weekend and I really enjoyed it. We lost both times since we didn't really get the subtle strategic differences from regular Pandemic (or maybe cause we had poor character combinations) but the theme really enhanced the experience for me and I feel like this is actually better than vanilla Pandemic.
Played Sentinals of the Multiverse for the first time at a friends house. It was really  enjoyable. First game was a little rough due to 2 players being new and I choose a more support oriented character (Captain Cosmic? The Green Lantern one) since the players said "Who is your favorite superhero."

Second game was a lot more fun as I played Guise, and could make really large combos on my turn, cranking out lots of damage.   

All in all I look forward to playing again and trying out more characters.
With the extended family during Thanksgiving we played some **Coup** and **The Resistance**

Conclusion, if you have the players for The Resistance, that is a far better game.  What a hit that was!

Out of the 8 times we played, spies won 6 of them.  So many accusations, couples immediately accusing the other of being a spy.

Fantastic lying performances that led a correct about to win resistance astray.  Just tremendous.

**Arkham Horror The Card Game**  Several plays both solo and with my wife.  We barely got trashed by the boss in the final scenario.  Would of won without combat had it not been for some bad draws on the encounter deck.

We're going to try again with different characters and including the Curse of the Rougaroo after the first act.

**Mechs vs Minions** 3P, we did the defend the school from waves of attack mission with only 3 mechs.  Would of been easier with 4 to get a perfect result.  We decided that just one minion getting through was acceptable.

This Friday, more Mechs vs Minions, **Mythos Tales**, and Arkham Horror the card game.  

***

Question 1:  I often play with my wife and with the kids as well.  They are for the most part nearly equal to my interest, though my daughter overall is less so on most games.

Question 2:  Longest game, probably **Eldritch Horror** vs Shub-Niggurath.  So many combat encounters!
Not many this week but they were all fun:

**ZÈRTZ** x2

**Conan**

**DVONN**

**Paris Connection**

**Troyes**
My BGG secret Santa gifts arrived so I got to play two of them.

**Islebound** 2p, love it, like I knew I would. It's a simple easy to teach game with enough strategy needed to be fun. I'll definitely be playing this a lot. I ended up winning after my opponent had a clear cut path to victory. He stockpiled a lot, and could basically sweep across the map with ease, so I rushed to force the ending before he could spend it all and I won.

**Archer Once You Go Blackmail** 2p x2, it's a love letter game if you weren't aware. It's definitely become my favorite due to a couple new card rules. It seems to have a lot more player interaction than the Batman variation. 

My SS also got me Inns And Cathedrals expansion for Carcassonne but I haven't had a chance to play it yet.
**Arkham Horror LCG** - (2p) played through the first scenario three times to get the hang of how the game works. I was a bit skeptical of the chaos bag, but I think it's more tense than dice rolling. Really enjoying this so far!

**Vast: The Crystal Caverns** - (4p) had only played this 2 player before. Dove in to a four player game with two new players and that learning curve is steep! The game came down to a very close ending, but it took WAY too long to get there. Most of that was due to the learning element. I think this game can be good, but everyone needs to be familiar with it before you unlock a really enjoyable play experience, because you need to be able to ascertain how close everyone is to achieving their goal and what actions they can take. Hopefully the [second printing kickstarter with updated rules](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2074786394/vast-the-crystal-caverns-second-printing-with-mini) will add some clarity. The first edition rules are lacking clarity. 

**Dead of Winter** - (4p) my first action was to move one of my characters into a building with two others and I rolled the dreaded bite on the exposure die...quite a dramatic start. Fortunately, the exposure didn't spread and we were able to recover for a fairly easy team victory, although I didn't accomplish my secret objective. 

**Betrayal House on the Hill w/ Widows Walk Expansion** - (5p) got one of the new haunts, which had a nice literary reference theme. Didn't see too many of the new cards/tiles. We did notice more movement flexibility between floors thanks to the dumbwaiter system. As always, the haunt included a fair amount of rules deciphering due to a lack of clarity, but that's the way Betrayal always is.  
**Lord of the Rings: LCG** - been wanting to get more plays in. 

**Scoville** - Introduced my sister and cousin to this game and upon finishing the first game, they immediately insisted on playing another round! Great hit! Non-combative game with fun aspects of planning and managing resources, set collection, and hidden information. 

**Kingdom Death: Monster** - I don't own a copy. I borrowed someone's rulebook, read through it, still reading through it, and playing through First Story, Settlement Phase, first Hunt Phase, and engaging soon in Showdown! So glad I pledged for the Kickstarter. Cannot wait to play more!!!! 

**Mage Knight** - not really played but catching up and refreshing on my rules. It's an annual tradition. Combat is a pain to learn but so rewarding to play! 
played many others, but **Space Cadets** ist worth to mention, 4h playtime, feels like working realy hard for the win, but at the same time creating so much insiders among the players. A very binding experience.
• **The Grizzled**: Took this out on our Black Friday brewery tour. By the third game (normal setting) and the second brewery, we finally got our boys home with only one card left in the morale stack. Tense!

• **Merchants and Marauders** My captain was a pure hunter, but my dice were pure shit. Couldn't successfully scout for a merchant in any of my three first turns; by this time the winner was doing well trading and already on a runaway trajectory. Love this game usually, but not this time.

• **Warhammer 40,000: Conquest**: Had the luxury of playing three games in a row with an out-of-town guest. Fantastic, edge-of-seat finishes and rousing battles every time. Honestly, this is the only game in my collection I really care about right now.
Plenty of good family gaming this week! I had to cancel heavy game night, so we kept it all pretty light.

***

* **Camel Up**: (2x 5p) I played this with my two nephews (7 and 9), my sister, and my fiancée. They boys did a great job! The older one did terribly in the first game, but he came back and did great in the second game. I'm glad they really seemed to like it! After we left, my sister texted me and told me they were now designing a board game haha.

* **New York 1901**: (1x 3p) I played this with my fiancée and her dad. She can't play this game at all for some reason lol. The spatial aspect just kills her. He did really well, but wasn't quite paying attention to the end game bonuses, and he let me sneak in there right at the end for the win.

* **Via Nebula**: (1x 3p) I'm still really enjoying this light Martin Wallace game. My friend and I actually tied and had to shake hands lol

* **Trump: The Game**: (1x 4p) I went to visit my college roommate and his fiancée, and I knew he had this. It simply had to get played lol. It was about as good as a game from 1989 under the Trump brand could be. It's honestly not the worst game I've ever played, but it's pretty shit lol

* **Le Fantôme de l'Opéra**: (1x 2p) I played this with my 11-year old niece, and she understood the rules, but she wasn't playing very strategically. It was actually pretty close, but she couldn't get there right at the end.

* **America**: (5x all player counts) This was a big hit with the families! It plays really simply and quickly. I'd like to try out Fauna now.

* **Thebes**: (1x 3p) I really like this game a lot. It's pretty lucky, but it's always a nice time. The theme is very fun and something that anyone can get into.

* **Above and Below**: (1x 3p) Always a great time. My sister really liked it, but my fiancée killed us as always.

* **Oregon**: (1x 2p) This was the last game of the weekend. I played it with her dad. I'd like to have played it with more, but we didn't have the time. I love this game, and he liked it a lot too!

***

* I consider my fiancée to be my immediate family- so all the time :D Her side of the family is more interested in games than mine. My sister likes them a lot if we can get her to play. Her dad will always be down for a game, but he's not the best at remembering rules sometimes.

* I'm really not sure. I recently played the horrifically bad Storm the Castle and that took about 4 hours (felt like 19).I've probably played a 4-5 hour game of Risk sometime. DND was usually 4-6 hours if that counts. 

* **Orleans** w/ **Orleans: Invasion** - 3x 2p - Played the Invasion scenario (co-op). We were kind of close to winning the first game, not close at all the second game, and missing only ONE worker in the last game.  Had the space to place it, had the meeples to place, but it was one of those scenarios where I have 4 in my bag of 12 meeples, I only need 1 of the 4, I can draw 8, and I drew all but the color I needed.  BAH! Will be trying again soon.

* **One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak** with **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** - 3x 5p - Introduced this to my family on Thanksgiving, fun was had by all. First time playing with Daybreak, I think it's probably more for experienced ONUW players as some of the roles were a little complex for just introducing it to first-timers. We tried twice with the Info Overload setup in the Daybreak rules, then once with the Total Chaos setup.  The Total Chaos setup was a lot of fun.
 
* **Game of Thrones: Hand of the King** - 1x 4p - My losing streak continues. It now stands at 6.

* **Roll for the Galaxy** with **Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition** - 2x 2p - Split the games with my wife. I like the new black & orange dice that are added, and the extra home tiles. I don't really care much about the objective-type cards. May just leave those out in the future, though I guess they don't take long to setup, and CAN give something to work toward.

* **A Feast for Odin** - 1x solo - Played once to get the hang of it before I teach my wife. My score was terrible (37) but that's partially due to my forgetting to upgrade my sheep and cows into things I could actually use to cover large spaces on the board. Oops.

-----------------------------------

***How often do you play games with your immediate family? Do they share your same interest in the hobby, or are they reluctant participants?***

Usually once or twice per year.  I always bring small games to family functions but they don't always get played. This past weekend I was lucky enough to get them to play 3 games of ONUW and 1 game of AGoT: Hand of the King.  

***What is the longest game you've ever played?***

I've played **Twilight Imperium (third edition)** exactly once. Rules explanation was close to an hour, we actually played for ~5 hours, and called it quits due to other obligations.  I think we were maybe 60-70% done.  Honestly, I didn't like it. Not one bit.  However, I was barely into the hobby at that point, and now that I've played tons more games, I keep thinking back to TI3 and things it did very well.  I want to play again.

Runners up: **Mage Knight** (a couple earlier games were close to 4 hours solo) and **Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization** (first 4p game was 5 hours, 2p games are about 3.5).
**Star Wars Destiny** - Played a bunch of games with my little brother over the holidays. The starter set play is very straightforward but a lot of fun. Once we'd played a few times we learned to adapt to the cards that were coming and were mixing things up tactically. It isn't Netrunner but I think it has legs. 
**Grand Austria Hotel**

Wow! This particular play really exemplified how brutal the game can be in certain circumstances.

My opponent (in a two player game) was stuck with three customers that he simply couldn't feed. The number one dice bay (for lack of a better term - the one that gives you cake and strudel) never filled with more than a dice or two at most for just about the entire 2nd half of the game. Same with the six pip dice slot (the one that would have allowed my opponent the option to take cake and strudel at a cost)...  Those who have played the game will know how hard it can be to get strudel (as you need at least two of the ten dice you roll to show one pip in order to get ONE strudel per round). So, he simply could not move those three strudel-requiring customers to their rooms at all. They were stuck. He couldn't even take advantage of the emperors track food bonus (to free up a slot by fully feeding a customer), at one point, because, the way I read it in the rules, one cannot move a customer to his room except during ones turn. So, he couldn't even grab a customer before his next turn. I confess, I took strudel dice just to block him. It was brutal... I came very close to lapping him on the scoring track (as it was smooth sailing for me, I had the one-time four-strudel giving employee, among other things, and I was just filling up room after room after room). Still like it though. Will probably even add it to my collection this coming week. But, yes, it can be BRUTAL!!!
   
**Gates of Loyang** x2

I want to like this game, but after the two plays this week, I don't think it'll ever end up in my collection, despite it having been designed by Uwe Rosenberg (one of my favorite designers - **Le Havre** and **Agricola** were my gateway games into modern gaming). The thing that really ruins it for me is the draft... Sometimes you simply cannot get the cards you need to remain competitive, it seems. The pay two buck for two cards action helps, but not enough. I was thinking maybe a house rule fix could be a bidding round (with a little extra cash given to each player) from a public tableau of cards. It's also a bit fiddly. 

**Russian Railroads**

Taught a friend this game. He liked it. Easy enough to teach. Putting this back into the rotation until I get to the ten games played threshold. Planning on busting out the **German Railroads** expansion soon (as well as buying the **American Railroads** expansion from the BGG store.
One issue: the two player game seems a little short to me (we hadn't moved our tracks very far down the board by game's end).

**The Gallerist**

Again, as I said before, this game does not reward too much in the way of experimentation. I absolutely dominated the influence track, the international market, had the most workers (all of them) out on the board, and had so many pink dudes in my gallery IT WAS OBSCENE!!! But, I simply did not discover enough artists. And, in my opinion, I think selling art to fulfill the requirements on the sold art bonus card is a very weak play. Apparently, one should always fill up one's Gallery and leave it filled. Mid-game my opponent almost conceded. But I ended up losing to her in the end. This game is not just about riding high on the influence track, as some of the forums would have you believe - it's primarily: discover then buy, discover then buy, promote, promote... Which, I guess, fits thematically. So, I shouldn't complain too much I guess. 

**Bruxelles 1893**

Finally getting my plays of a game that spent far too long gathering dust on the shelf. Such an elegant game. So happy to own it. Staying in the rotation.

**City of Iron: Second Edition**

Fun to play. But seems a little flawed. Runaway leader problem, maybe? A round or two too short, maybe? Some of the era C cards seem pretty useless. The one point for every three purple crystals card? Like anyone's ever going to grab that (who will ever have more than a few crystals by that point to begin with?). It's fun to play, I like most of the mechanics, and the art is very nice. But it kind of leaves you wanting for more.

**Voyages of Marco Polo** x2

Put this game back into the rotation and it was a hit with the two people I taught. My favorite dice game (as both low rolls and high rolls can be very useful) because bad luck doesn't so much as punish you, but just changes your strategy. Low rolls? "I'm travelling this round, I guess" 
Easy-ish to teach, and very fun. Keeping it in the rotation for now, even though I have plenty of plays logged (16 as of today). 

**Far Space Foundry** (with **Ether Ore**, **Extra Pilots** and **Extra Products** expansions)  

First time for all four players learning the game. Because there was so much to learn - it was a little stressful. Was hard to get a grip on what strategies will work during play.  The two main phases are very different and it's kind of hard to see how things are going to work out that first play-through. At the end, you can see what you should've done better... I can see, therefore, how a second play would be a bit more enjoyable with all players experienced and forewarned of what's to come. Theme and mechanics make sense. The rondel-on-steroids thingy can be a little tough to get used to for some, it seems. Turn order matters a little too much for my liking, maybe? First player not nice in a four player game, maybe? I dunno. Will be happy to play again to give in another chance. Expansions were fine.

**Castles of Mad King Ludwig** (with the **Secrets** expansion)

Quick two player game. Seems to end too quickly sometimes, especially with two players. We threw in all the expansions. Neither bought or used moats nor secret passages (it was late and maybe we didn't feel like brain-burning with the passages or simply forgot/ignored them, even though it would have likely added several points). I really don't know how much **Secrets** adds to the game, and, honestly, I could do without it. Doesn't really seem to improve the game much, if at all, in my opinion. 

Edit - small grammar fix


I got in some great games in this week.

2P **7 Wonders Duel** This was the first time I played with the Pantheon expansion. I enjoyed what it added to the game, but I played a terrible first age (not getting any resources to speak of) and ended up losing to my opponent in Age 3 by way of a military victory. Probably my worst game of Duel that I can remember, so I'm eager to get it back to the table soon!

2P **Targi** This went better for me. I was introducing it to my buddy that crushed me in Duel, and he caught on quickly. This is definitely one of my favorite two player games, and I was glad he liked it, as well.

2x 4P **Codenames** Played this with my wife, brother, and sister-in-law before got into our game of Pandemic Legacy. Although this is my favorite big group game, I also like it at 4 as it spreads the pressure around equally. Tons of fun.

4P **Pandemic Legacy** We won our first game of March! I'm hoping at some point I can convince everyone to play twice in a row so we can move a bit quicker, but I'm enjoying our slow trod through the year.

4P **Istanbul** I've been busy with grad school and haven't been as active in the meetup group I attend lately, so I was excited when they moved the regular Friday meeting this week to Saturday, which meant I could make it. I hadn't played Istanbul before, and I got Five Tribes vibes from it, particularly as the spatial puzzle didn't come to me intuitively. However, just like Five Tribes grew on me immensely as I got more comfortable with it, I can see Istanbul doing the same. We played with the Mocha expansion and a couple of promo tiles, as well. Really enjoyed it.

5P **Viticulture** We also played this at the meetup. As I'm often introducing this and other games to my friends, I was glad to play with other experienced players. We played with the extended board from Tuscany, as well as the advanced visitors, Moor visitors, property expansion and mamas and papas. Although I still find the random card draw frustrating at times, it remains one of my favorite games.

_____________________________________

* I play with my wife 2 or 3 times a month, maybe once a week if I'm lucky. I play with my brother once every couple of months, maybe once a month if we can get together more often. My brother shares my love of games, but doesn't spend as much time invested in the "hobby" (podcasts, forums, etc.), whereas my wife only plays games because I enjoy them, although she has her favorites. I might play with other family members once or twice a year, at holidays or other times.

* TI3
* **Riff Raff** - This has been a dexterity grail game for me. You place pieces onto a rocking and rotating pirate ship. It really moves like a ship at sea. Loved it.

* **The Oracle of Delphi** - Still enjoying the latest Feld. I had a very satisfying final turn where I managed to complete my final three tasks and return to Zeus for the win.

* **Roll Player** - Fun puzzle dice game with a great theme. I was a scoundrel orc paladin with a backstory of the "chosen one." I came in last.

* **Hamsterrolle** - Another dexterity game I've wanted to play for a while. I enjoyed it but not as much as Riff Raff.

* **Aquasphere** - Man, this game is tight! There's so much you want to do but you simply can't do it all. I understand Tom Vasel's point about it playing like you're in a straight jacket. I loved it.

* **Mombasa** - We got off to a rocky start but got the hang of it eventually. I focused on investing heavily in one company to my detriment. I'd love to give it another go.

***
I play lighter games with my family a few times a year. I can sometimes cajole my older daughter into something heavier.

I don't think I've ever played a game that took more than 3 hours.
Wife and I finished April in **Pandemic Legacy** yesterday. We had won the past two months so our funding was down to 0, we FULLY expected to loose super fast, but ended up pulling a win out by the skin of our teeth haha. On to May now and the outlook is iffy haha.
**A Feast for Odin** (5x 2p) - My wife and I FEASTED all of last week.  The first two games, we were exploring all the different actions. By now, we've fell into a strategy we want to master: she's going the emigration and cattle route; I'm going the exploration and sheds route.  There is (lots of) room for improvement.  

**Lords of the Waterdeep** (1x 3p) - Such an excellent game to introduce new people to worker placement games, or even to Euro-style games in general.  It's very easy to teach and very straightforward to play.  My friends, who never played any modern games before, the closest to that is Catan, caught on quick.  They were impressed and had lots of fun.  This gateway game opened their eyes.  I can't wait to introduce them to my other games! 

I play mostly with my wife.  Occasionally, I bring my lighter games to family gatherings and have a blast because it's nice to see their reaction and mentality change about board gaming. 

The longest games I've ever played are **Agricola** and **A Feast for Odin**.

Had a great week of gaming. Felt good. On Monday H and I got a few games of **Klask** in, since we had planned to take it to my family’s Thanksgiving get together.  We aren’t normally into dexterity games but Klask is definitely a winner. Air Hockey for board gamers, enough said really. I won 2 of 3. 

On Thanksgiving we tried out **Codenames** with my sisters, so we had a two on two game. I’ve only ever played this game two vs two or three vs three. I think it probably works better with more players, and works much better when everyone is decently experienced at it. I would go as far to say that it kinda just sucks if you have never played before. I think my sisters liked it ok, but it wasn’t exactly the great fun that I think they were expecting. 

Next we brought out the electronic **Catchphrase**, which actually was the great fun my sisters were expecting. Haven’t laughed that hard at a party game in a long time. Very fun, very underrated good time. 

Finally I brought out Klask and played a few rounds a piece with my niece, my nephew, and H. My niece is seven and seemed to like it ok but lost interest after a game. My nephew is 10 and seemed to like it quite a bit, but also eventually kinda lost interest and liked just playing with the pieces instead. 

Friday after Thanksgiving we both had work off so H and I were able to get a fair amount of gaming in. Played a morning game of **Castles of Burgundy**. Always fun for us, a great game to play in the morning over coffee. We played with the monastery boards mini-expansion but forgot to actually score them, whoops. H won.

Next was a quick game of **Onitama** which H got the best of me in.

A bit later in the afternoon we got our new copy of **Grand Austria Hotel** to the table. We first played at Gen Con over the summer and I’ve been itching for it to come back into print ever since. It was as good as I remember. I made a mistake at the end and seated a guest when I couldn’t actually fulfill his order and had to lose five points. This seemed to ultimately lose me the game when I lost by three points.

The last game of the day was **Five Tribes**, which we had never played before. Very tactical. The first several moves seem to be more of a “I’ll move this here and see what happens” type of deal instead of trying to form some sort of strategy. I do love games that employee a mancala mechanism, even if I’m not always that great at figuring them out. H thought the board was too busy and that was it was kind of a pain in the ass keeping track of everything, which I don’t necessarily disagree with. Still, I liked the game and I’m looking forward to playing it again.

Saturday night we got a few in when I got home from work. Learned **Darkrock Ventures**, which was a bit of a blind kickstarter back for me. I backed it because at the time we didn’t have a whole lot of space themed games, now we have an abundance. Oh well. I thought Darkrock was a decent game, but very light. Maybe too light for our tastes. You can mitigate the dice rolls to an extent, but you will also likely come to at least one turn where you can manipulate the hell out of the dice and still end up with nothing. H disliked this particular aspect of the game, which I also don’t disagree with. I did think the game was fine, and maybe it can scratch the itch when we don’t feel like thinking very hard.

Followed up with **Roll Player**, which was a much more successful kickstarter back for us. We ended up tying this game but H had more gold and won the tie breaker

On Sunday played **Legends of Andor** twice. Had never played before. Went through the tutorial once and the introductory legend twice. Initial impression: this game is HARD. I had kinda thought we would spend most of the day playing the game, going through the different scenarios, but after losing the second time (and realizing we had accidentally skipped a legend card, making the game easier we got a little frustrated and packed it up. I think it’s a good game, well designed and I’m looking forward to playing other scenarios and possibly getting some of the expansions. However, I’m not as much of a fan of getting pummeled by the board over and over. I don’t want to house rule it quite yet, but have read several ways to make the game a bit easier. 

Questions: 

Almost never. Just at Thanksgiving pretty much. I do almost all of my gaming with my girlfriend. My sisters and mom have no interest in “the hobby” but they will readily play a party style game at a family gathering. 

Longest game I actually enjoyed – Battlestar Galactica. If it’s over two hours for us, it’s probably too long. 

Real Thanksgiving was last month, but I hope you Americans had good times with family. Here's what I played this week:

* **6 nimmt!** - played 4 players with the wife, mother-in-law, and sister. First time for all of us, though I have played the app a few times. It was decent. We had to cut it short slightly, but my sister was winning.

* **Lords of Vegas** - 4 players as above. First time for all of us again. I won. Pretty fun game. I see how it could replace Monopoly in many ways, and still retain some of the elements from it.

* **Castles of Burgundy** - first time playing, with the wife. I won, but we both love this game (and we already loved the Card Game version). We'll be playing again soon!

* **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** - a couple hours straight at my FLGS with close to max player count (10-11 per round). What a great game! The more I play, the more I love it. I guess that's why it's my favorite.

* **New Bedford** - taught the wife how to play. She liked it more than expected, given the theme, but still not as good as Viticulture, she says. I won.

* **The Game** - solo. I can't remember my score, but it wasn't that good. I like this little game, and can't wait until I sleeve it so I can play it with others (the North American release has horrible card quality, black cards, which damage VERY easily).

I also played some app games, like San Juan, Splendor, Labyrinth, etc.

1. I play regularly with my wife. She likes to game a lot. Also with my 4-year-old, who loves his board games. I just get a little bored with his games, so I hope his interest stays as he gets older and can play some of the rest of my collection. My sister games with us once every week or two.

2. Longest I've played? Probably Star Trek Frontiers. The first time I played it solo and was teaching myself, I think it took like 4 hours because it's complex and I didn't want to make a mistake, and the rulebooks are a little confusing, having to jump all over the place (especially when you're playing solo).
* **Ascension: Apprentice Edition** (x3, solo) - There aren't a lot of games that can be picked up for 10$ (in Canada, anyways) and I doubt I'd find many of them as satisfying as Ascension. Played my first game on Monday and botched the honour count, causing the game to drag out really long. It was fun regardless! Played two games yesterday, focusing on Lifebound heroes in the first and on Mechana in the second. I was really dubious of the Mechana strategy since Lifebound heroes seem much more plentiful, but I ended up getting four Mechana Constructs and my best score yet. It's definitely got me itching for one of the bigger sets, but I'm far from exhausting the play I can get out of this base set.

---

* Two or three times a year, maybe? My family live about six hours away so we usually only get time together on holidays. My brothers are very willing participants, having had previous exposure to **Catan**, MtG, D&D and that sort of stuff. My parents I've yet to rope in, but this year's Christmas invitation included: "bring that Cat... Cat-anne game", hahahaha.
* Either **Scoville**, which took us upwards of an hour and a half, or a game of **Qwirkle** with my AP prone friend. It mustn't've been longer than 45-60 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. I'm a "play for fun" gamer, whereas he's a "maximise you score" gamer; I constantly felt like screaming: "Just put down a damn tile!" 
This was an instant buy for me. After I ordered I looked at BGG and was a little worried about it. Got it in the mail yesterday. Played the solo version and really enjoyed it. Glad I went through with the purchase.


I've really enjoyed it! It really is Patchwork 2.0 - It's nice that I can play it up to 4 players. It is a little lighter to me than Patchwork because its far more forgiving. Lots of fun and worth the buy. 
I wonder when this will be available in the US?  I can't find it available for pre-order anywhere.
I bought this because it was Patchwork (which I'd heard a lot about), but for more than 2 players.  

I am a bit annoyed with the sticker sheet that came with it to correct their errors (I dont mind stickering the rulebook, more annoyed about the board).

I'm kinda looking forward to buying this, but I think I'll wait until the first reprint to avoid the whole Sticker Gate situation.
How does it play with 2 players? My fiance loves gardening, cats, and games, so this seems like a natural one for our collection.
Apparently reviews are unwanted here... lol
Prosperity and Seaside are the two best IMO. I would go for Seaside if only getting one 
Intrigue adds extra treasure and vp cards to allow 5-6 player games if your group needs that. It also adds more interaction between players if you want it to be a more interactive/take that game.
prosperity and seaside are always the top 2. i would add dark ages to this, but that's just me!
**Space Hulk** eh? Too bad my board game budget has been obliterated already.
Seems like they are misinformed on kingdom Death: Monster. The monsters they linked were never are promo miniatures and not part of the game. 

And don't get me wrong KDM has always had over sexualized women, just not in the ways they described in the article.
I wish a little more research would go into articles about Kingdom Death. Full disclosure - I got in on the first Kickstarter and I enjoy the game.

First - the first run of the game, funded by the first Kickstarter, was for sale on the Kingdom Death web store, at GenCon, and 2 copies were sold at a retail store somewhere on the west coast (I have read). It had a high ($400) retail price, but has been available for less since the first Kickstarter closed in the form of a pre-sale now on the second Kickstarter.

Second - the current Kickstarter is for a reprint of the core game, plus some extras. Nothing has been de-sexed. The game just started funding and much of the sexual content was add on material that was optional and will be added to the current campaign as it is revealed.

Third - two of the monsters linked (Forge God and Wet Nurse) were not included anywhere in the first Kickstarter. A Google image search was done and images from non game minis (of which Kingdom Death has a bunch of) are being used to describe the Kickstarter offerings. The third monster linked is the Gorm, which was available as an optional expansion the first time around.

Fourth - the game does not allow you to customize a mini with a dick skirt. That image is from another (so far) non-game mini, one of the Satan twins. The skirt is not a piece of gear you can make, and is likely not compatible with the minis in the box without some modifying. The Satan twins are resin, non-game minis that were designed after the first Kickstarter.

Fifth - the $1,666 level pledge. This article states that you haven't played the game before. This is only kind of true as the current Kickstarter is for a reprint/update of a game I have been playing for about a year. There are people who have played the game, and are interested in an updated copy along with all the extras they can get. It is not a completely untested idea - if you have played the game as it exists now (or seen it I person) you have a pretty good idea about the game and its production value.

It looks like the writers of this article didn't do too much research other than a Google search before writing it. I know that this game has nudity and sexual themes in it, but there is more to it than that. Much of the more graphic/overt sexual nature in the game is in optional expansions and add on promo material - things that are not included in the base game.
There's a lot of complaining in the comments, but I for one am glad there's been a non-kneejerk look at KDM from SUSD. It also mentions the correct delivery date (summer 2017, normal KS turnaround) for the first round of materials, while making the point that in four years for the farthest-out content, who knows where or who we'll all be? Whoever it is that's sending them a copy, thank you - so many people simply react to the existence of this game without trying it, and much like Xia, it's a one-man dream project that's glorious despite its flaws. 

Additionally, don't you worry about less gonzo-ness. The most insane things like the Wet Nurse and Forge God were usually promos and pin-ups, so that those who wanted to go to that extreme totally could, and the core game, while still gross and full of dicks and tits, came across less... lurid? The new KS seems aimed to shut down the aforementioned knee-jerk reactions (see [Kickstarting Sexism](https://bitchmedia.org/post/save-vs-sexism-kickstarting-sexism), one of the first Google results for KDM up until recently) by at least sexualizing men and women for the pin ups. The core book still has some weird shit in it, and wait till you see the Nightmare Ram (probably tomorrow). Core game still comes with the Phoenix, and it has a sculpted cloaca covered in baby hands that can actualy grab you and pull you in. I'd expect less Forge God levels of graphic but certainly Gorm/Sunstalker/Phoenix levels. If one new monster doesn't have like a weird sculpted dick I will be disappointed. 
Also shoutout for mentioning not only KDM, one of my kickstarter babies, but Vast, another lovely game that wouldn't be possible without Kickstarter. Both games are from first-time creators and have no major game companies behind them (although originally KDM got some help from CMON and Studio McVey, when they were both much smaller entities), and wouldn't exist without KS backers. Also both games are great, although seven roles for Vast?! Wowsa. Still looking forward to the 4x from Patrick Leder and the Forbidden Stars guy. Hell, Patrick's working on like three games at the moment and I'm hyped for all of them.
Going to try to narrow it down a little bit to put you in the right direction. What kind of game are you looking for? Something:

- Fun and casual (holiday stuff with family)
- Tactical
- Wargame / Area control
- Worker placement
- Heavy / Medium / light game
- Duration? >1h ... 3h+?
- Number of players?
- Player interaction?
- ...
Light Euro with worker placement:

- Stone Age.

Betrayal/Bluff:

- Avalon 
- Sheriff of Nottingham.

If you want straight up betrayal go for Avalon but a more negotiation oriented game get SoN. 

If you want a longer and heavier betrayal + coop game with a bit more depth go for Dead of Winter, Battlestar Galactica or Dark Moon.

2 player game: 

- Star Realms. 

Cheap and good deckbuilder.

Area Control/Dudes on a Map: 

- Light: 8 Minute Empires: Legends. 

Just control more of the map to win.

- Heavier: Cycklades, very cool bidding game where you have to bid on the gods favours to purchase armys and move your boats and stuff. (If you like bidding/auction games I would also recommend RA, it's a blast.)

Card Drafting games: 

- Sushi Go or 7 Wonders.

If you want something heavier maybe Seasons is for you.

I recently played a pretty neat little set collecting game called Archaeolgy: the New Expedition. It was pretty fun and very easy to learn.
I was debating on pledging for SDE:L as my go-to for a light dungeon crawl and found Yokai Quest on KS along the way. Might want to check that out. I decided in the end to take a gamble on it as it looks promising.
I backed the legendary pledge for SDE:L, but their constant rules updates and lack of any reveals of how Legends will actually work made me cancel my pledge. Ended up backing Massive Darkness as my easy-going dungeon crawler game. 
If I had the money and the space I would go for KD:M

I'm not sure if you have ever played SDE but I think it's the weaker of the two.
I brought SDE on the cheap to paint and for the dungeon crawling experience, sadly the game fell flat with my friends and wife.  It was too basic and the games go on and on and on, what you see in the first ten minutes of gameplay just repeats a lot. It's great for a gauntlet style kill the baddies and loot up but that's basically it.

I understand legends will bring a campaign but I'm not sure if it will bring anything better to the table compared to KD:M or other great campaign/rpg games out there like decent, star wars IA, Eldritch Horror, MoMv2 etc..

SDE: Even with a campaign, I think the basic hack n' slash mechanics and the rinse repeat of baddies will not give you the best dungeon role playing experience.


Not that useful sorry.
What is SDE:L exactly?
Any chance you could coordinate a PM with me if you decide to cancel the KDM pledge? Would love to save 50 bucks grabbing an open spot lol
I really wish I could justify pulling the trigger on this for $30 Mysterium, but we've already got 12 board games wrapped for Christmas.

Edit: My wife does not appreciate ya'lls encouragement
Wow, great deal on Mansions of Madness with this.
Thank you! Just got Fury of Dracula for $37!
Thanks for the heads-up! This is an actual really good sale, unlike most of the cyber Monday nonsense I've seen today. 

I picked up Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle for just over $30. Considering going back in under a different email for another game : )
BNCYBER16
I wish the b&n website wasn't so terrible. It's almost impossible to find just boardgames with getting all the kids toy junk. 
I thought the 30% already expired? 

[Edit - got it -- mobile site is just trash]
Thanks! Picked up Mansion of Madness. 
This is an amazing deal. 
The 30% applies automatically to games. If you want multiple then open an incognito tab after the first. My second order was giving me trouble.
I got Imperial Assault and TIME stories.
I also think you can add an extra 10 percent off with BN membership.

Saved. Thank you!
Thanks for the heads up. :)
You can get Ticket to Ride: Rails and Sails for less than $50 with this combo (compared to $68 at CSI)
Damn. I was hoping they'd have Concept so I could pick it up a bit cheaper for Christmas.  This is a great deal, though. 
Sigh, fine. Ordered Fury of dracula. I have 4 other games sitting in plastic and I keep ordering more.
Just picked up TIME Stories for $30!
Also Sentinels of the Multiverse is 30% off so with all those coupons it would be well below 20$ for a fantastic regularly 40$ game
First game will be minimum 2 hours including learning how to play. After that you can speed it up but that's only with the short scenarios.
There are short, medium, and long scenario cards included, double-sided, as I think one side is supposed to be harder than the other. I think after you get a few games under your belt, if you stick to the short scenarios, and if you set everything up before everyone arrives, you can get your play time down to under an hour. It's all dependent on how the people play, though. If people take a long time to decide what to do, then it's naturally going to take longer. Anyhow, I think we usually take about 70-90 minutes for a 4-player game. It's so good, though. It's worth it. The game doesn't ever feel like it overstays its welcome to me, but we also stick mostly to the short scenarios.
Setup takes a little longer than I'd like but it finishes in a bit over an hour for 3 of us. 

More people would take longer though, as will your first play through. 
Yeah that is indeed some wildly variable play times then again there are scenarios iirc which will definitely increase/decrease playtime.

The single time I've played Dead of Winter we were annihilated in under an hour and were pretty demoralized afterwards.  Perhaps shall bring it out again soon but whew brutal
The game is a bear with all the little rules but if one person knows them all and is a competent teacher it is fine.
I started a game of The Long Night 11:45 PM, finished at 3:30 2/3s the way through the Bandit Blitz scenario. So much quarterbacking for what turned out to be a fairly hard to detect insta betrayal.
In the game group I usually play with it, our playtime is around 2.5 hours for short scenarios but we play as 4 or 5 players and usually there is at least one new player
A lot. Always. I think three hours and a half average, but we always have to teach someone how to play.

Of course, that could be cut to an hour and a half if we tried to play fast. I usually only put it on the table when everyone has at least three hours to play, so we prefer to take our time I guess.
A lot of the play time is the meta game that goes on around the main game. Discussions, negotiations, pleading, etc. If you have a vocal group who like to talk, then you can be looking at 2+ hours.

A quiet and effective group who know what they are doing? You could blast through a long scenario easily in under 1.5 hours.

Throw a traitor into the mix though and all heck breaks loose. That's when the deductions and confrontations happen (one of the key parts of the game) and the game comes alive for both the betrayer and the betrayed.

It's a cracking game, and you absolutely should make time for it, but given your time limits, I wouldn't expect it to fit with your playtimes. 
Even the short scenarios took minimum 2 hours for us.
I don't think you'll get done in an hour, especially your first go at it.  We've taken around two hours every time.  That doesn't include set up time at the front end, which is significant.  It's a great game and I agree that it's worth the time/effort investment, but it's definitely one of your "main event" types of games.
90ish minutes.
It took 3 hours for 3 people playing a medium length scenario.   
That the screenshot includes the word stopwatch broken into two lines bothered me more than it should. 
Whats the difference between the dice roller and the random number generator? Are the dice limited to only 6 sided? That's all I saw in the picture and if so that's kind of disappointing.
I'll give it a try, thanks.
I don't know for sure, but I checked their site last week and they had an entire FAQ page devoted to telling people that things were ok. I'm assuming orders are just being fulfilled slowly.
As long as they show up before the end of December I'm good.
The site is still there, it's just not advertised on the main page. Check out [the FAQ](https://holiday-sale.fantasyflightgames.com/about/holiday-sale-faq/) for info about shipping.

**TL;DR**: They're being slow about shipping because of the volume of orders. You should have gotten a confirmation email with your order number in it, you can contact them about it if you think something screwy happened.
I believe it was mentioned elsewhere on here that their first batch of shipping would be going out at some point today. I wouldn't be surprised if they just went with an automated system and gave everyone the vacation off other than a few techies on call.
I spoke with someone yesterday (11/28) and yeah shipping was supposed to start. I was told my order was prepared and waiting in the warehouse to be picked up by shipping partner. I still haven't gotten a shipping email yet, but a quick google search in years past found that that is an automated email and several people got packages before the shipping email was sent. 
I love the game, I've never won it, but the five plays I have were all tense strategic struggles. definitely works best with the full six players though.
I have it and I haven't been able to get enough people to play yet, but I think it looks pretty sweet.  A lot of the negative reviews, from what I can tell, are unduly influenced by the fact that it isn't set in the Dune universe; the rule set is an updated version of the old Dune board game but without the Dune license.  Without an attachment to Dune, I'm not bothered.

But I haven't even played it, so what do I know.
It's my group's favorite game.  I love how intense the diplomacy gets along with the hard coded alliance system.  But it's greatest disadvantage is you need at least four to really get a good game and an awkward five for the greatest game.  My group tends to either be  three people available or eight... Never anything in between. The only thing that could've made it better is if they were able to get the  original Dune license.  When we play we still use the dune faction names.  Well Enjoy your time with it , i really want to play now.
You're in luck. Cry Havoc co-designer Grant Rodiek just published the first issue of his games magazine Quagmire talking about nothing but Rex.

http://hyperbolegames.com/blog/quagmire-issue-1-rex
I have only played it one time about a year ago but I remember really enjoying it and was itching to try it again. I jotted a few notes down on BGG after our play. 

We were all first time players, it took us an hour to set up and learn the rules. According to my notes it was easy and intuitive to play once we got going. We played with 5 people and it quickly evolved into a 3v2 (which wasn't really a bad thing, it was a fairly interesting game with 5 with all the unique race powers). I wrote that 6 or 4 players would probably be preferred in the future. I remember it being a very political game which suits our group great.

We almost played it a couple weeks ago but ran out of time in the evening, hopefully we will play again soon though, I like the game a lot.
It's a really good game. It's a re-print of Dune set in the Twilight Imperium universe. It also fixes issues in the original game.

The main gripe people have with this game is that it's not Dune themed any more, which can't really be helped, because nobody is getting that license back.
Disclaimer: played it once.

The impression the game left on me was that it is completely dependent upon full internalization of the rule set to even feel like you have a chance at douchebaggery.  It's not a game you can bullshit your way through and for that you have to have a very 'into it' group I feel.

I'm more than willing to give it another go but learning it was a slog and I find myself wondering if other games in my collection may scratch that proverbial itch.  Thoughts?
I've only played it twice, once with 5 and once with 6. It's probably best with 4 or 6, since you then won't have unequal alliances (although that might not be a huge issue). I personally quite like it, it's pretty rules-heavy and it took us a long time to play both times, but it has a lot of cool and interesting mechanics. I especially like the fact that you can have actual alliances, instead of the "pseudo-kind-of-alliances" you have in a lot of other area-control strategy games. 

Both games we did kind of have an underdog team though, especially the second time, and they didn't have a lot of fun fighting  just to make sure we barely didn't win every single round. What happened was that two players smashed their armies together the turn before alliances were made, which meant there were three of us who could make a strong alliance, opposed by two weak players and a third player who kind of fooled around. 

Was it kind of their own fault? I suppose, but I'd warn you that because of the combat system making it so easy to lose a ton of units really quickly, and how precious resources can be, it's easy to screw yourself over hard in one fatal move.
I used to have it. It's a good game, but a few things kept me from playing it often. I've got a few other clever battle games, and limited chances to play with a group that really appreciates that type of game, so it didn't make the cut. (Chaos in the Old World is my favorite of those, Cyclades a close second.)

I wasn't playing it because:

It's long, longer than other similar games, and that makes it harder to play. 

It's hard to get new players up to speed. Not in terms of rules, but in terms of fun. You can play badly in chaos in the old world and still feel like you're doing stuff. If you play badly in Rex, you can paint yourself into a corner where you feel like you have no control. 

The battles are very brittle. Losing a battle hurts a lot. Some people like that. But add in the simultaneous selection part of the battle, and it feels... just not quite enough under your control. Losing feels bad, and winning doesn't feel satisfying. 

That said, I love the factions, and I LOVE the alliance system. Someone should use that alliance system in a lean-and-mean 60 minute game, that would be great. 

It's an odd tie in to Twilight Imperium, and like others have said, it's a reskin, so it's strange all around. 

It's very asymmetrical. In some cases, it's made up for. The turtles are very weak, but have a pretty cool bonus win condition. Others however, are just worse overall with no real balance mechanic to make up for it.

It's fun, does unique and interesting things, but can and will leave you feeling like you lost because the game itself was flawed.
I demoed this game several times and it seemed to always end on turn 2 or turn 8. Keep that in mind, Bene Gesserit -- err, space turtle players. 
Played it once, and I loved it. It has a brilliant alliance mechanism that does a fantastic job of encouraging negotiation and aggressive play.

 In Rex, you can ally with a player and share a victory, which means begging the dominant player for an alliance. In an average area control game, getting an early lead is pointless because other players will team up against you.



I LOVE the original Dune (Which Rex reimplements) but could never get my hands on a copy. Rex neatly fills in the hole left by not owning Dune. 

I've played the game a lot and still really enjoy it. Think my game groups aren't as enthusiastic as I am, but every now and then I manage to wear them down. 
That's funny ! I bought this game on a whim, in a clearance sale (it costed me 5 or 7€, in fact I bought that day 11 games for 50€, the price of one of them).

I put it on a shelf, untouched, still in wrap.

The comments make me want to unwrap it just now, but I'm not at home right now, aaaargh !
It's good, but showing it's age.

We only got to play it once, and had fun, but there were problems with it:

- The board felt very barren, as money (influence) was gobbled up very quickly and battles were limited to hot-spots.
- The auctions took too long and were very exhausting. We'll house rule them to close-fist simultaneous auctions next game.
- Alliances were very powerful. We've played a 6 player game, and with the first negotiations card drawn we've formed a 3-player alliance, a 2-player alliance, and one player stayed solo. We, the 3-player alliance, steam-rolled the other players from that point onward, controlling all the auctions and murdering the opposition with ease. It was just very easy once the alliances were formed, and since no other negotiation card came up we've stuck to them.
- There's 0 incentive to actually use treason cards, as you've already won the game at the point where you can do it and it gains you nothing other than the title "Sir-no-one-will-ever-ally-with-me-again".

So, while we've enjoyed it, we couldn't really get it to the table ever since, since it was problematic and middling, and we have better games.
They used [Gamecrafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/questing). It's a fun way to get a game professionally made, but as you can see from this game, not really the most economical. You end up paying retail prices for all of your pieces which makes even simple games cost $30-40.
I played oh my lair and I love it.
R/tabletopgamedesign usually has lots of tips for this.
brb, going to find that "Unpopular board game opinions" thread
Part of the SU&SD Vimeo exodus. The original post: https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/review-tta/
Best review to date. Love the outtakes at the end LOL.
uh... did matt lees die? serious question. not sure if comedy or not here. really sorry to hear if true. relieved and good to hear if just comedy.
Love how they make you really feel how drawn out the game is!😂
Does anyone know the name of the classical music they play in the beginning? I can't put my finger on it ...
After reading about the bag building of Siberia (one bag for everyone), I kinda want to try it in Orleans.

*Stop putting Knights in the bag! I want Scholars!!*
Excellent deck-building-dudes-on-the-board mechanic in this awesome game. 
Wow. There is some real meat in this review. I didn't read it all but it really looks like they put some effort into this. 
[Shadowrun: Crossfire](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135382/shadowrun-crossfire) is a card game set in the same universe of Shadowrun, a futuristic sci-fi RPG. Crossfire is a complete package on its own with everything you need to play the game for 1-4 players. There is one expansion out for it, but it just provides you with new missions and characters if you want something new after playing with the base game. 
Doesn't seem like my type of game.  If it's this confusing to figure out which one to pick, then I'm out, lol.  

I so badly want a CoOp game to play like a dungeon crawler, but I don't want a DM.  I want everyone to play on the same level.  
Shadowrun: Crossfire can be an *exceedingly* tedious game.  Watch some review videos to see if it's up your ally.  I think it's one of the most disappointing games I've ever played. 
Ask for the 5th edition rulebook, the master index edition being the current version. Read that to get started. 

And download the arcology podcast. 
**Apples to Apples**. I'm done thanks. While the combinations and jokes are new, they somehow feel the same to me. 
Munchkin, any varient.

After a time you go through all permutations of mechanics and then its just dull strategies dealing with luck of the draw...

Not to mention its about 10 minutes of fun build up with an hour of dull high level sudden death (which should be an oxymoron). 
**Cards Against Humanity**
The usual suspects: Monopoly and Risk. But I haven't played them in more than 10 years.
Years ago I was introducing board games to some friends and based on their gaming experience **Dominion** was a great start. That ended up being the only game they wanted to play and I burnt out on the game because of it. Great game, but I think I'm retired.
**Magic: The Gathering**. And, by extension any and every TCG or LCG.

I started playing **M:tG** in 1994, during my senior year of high school. I got into and out of the game twice before getting a job a WotC in 1998. When I left WotC in in 2002, I tried to continue playing but lost all interest, and had forgotton while working there just how ridiculously expensive it is. I sold my collection for the final time in 2003, and refuse to play any sort of expansion-dependent card game.
I'm in the same boat as you with **Settlers of Catan**, the game is so dependent on the initial settlement choosing locations that you can be completely shafted from that point onwards.  I also hate the fact that it can be your turn and have virtually nothing available to do because of rolls.  Settlers was probably my gateway game, but it's a game I definitely don't look forward to playing anymore.  It's funny because I loved playing it at first and I thought how unique and different the game is...but then you get into the hobby and appreciate other game mechanics.
**Cards against Humanity**, **Ludo** and **Monopoly**. I just hope nobody gifts me a different version of Monopoly this year. 

Edit: Sorry! to > Ludo
**Small World** and **Legendary Marvel**. I've played it as much as I have because at the time we did not have many games and people mostly enjoyed them.


I don't want to look at them anymore.
Cards Against Humanity in a nutshell:

1. Draw a bunch of cards where not everyone in your group "gets" whatever is referenced

2. Hold onto these cards to use on throwaway rounds, aka rounds where you have nothing and expect failure

3. Realize that one of your friends (it might be you!) is significantly better at creative wordplay

4. Half heartedly exist for 80% of the game while waiting for glimmers of comedy


It's just not a good game. If you want a game like that then Superfight is a better option. It at least allows you a chance to build up and argue the comedy of an otherwise lame combo.

CAH lacks that option because if you're winning then yours won't be chosen out of spite if you cheerlead it. Just lacks polish.
Love Letter, Jaipur, and Splendor, all for the same reason. At this point it's just mechanical and luck of the draw, we're as good as we're ever going to be at the game.

(Unpopularly) Codenames - the downtime is killer for me.
**CAH**

I'm just so sick of it now. It lacks depth or replay value. I just cannot stand it anymore. I don't dislike people who like it or anything, it just feels so shallow to me. I always feel like it people have to force themselves to laugh at it, because it's really not that funny most of the time. 

It's just a bland game after the second play and despite that it still always comes out. What does annoy me is when **CAH** gets played over other games, as an example, I bought **Resistance : Avalon**, it's still hasn't been played and at this point I now realize it probably never will because they refuse to play it, and instead slump back to **CAH**.
Machi koro
Smash up.  There's always someone who combos their cards endlessly and takes forever optimizing their turn, and trying to keep track of all of the card interactions is tedious.  

The game would be more fun if the group would just lay down a card and not be so concerned with scoring every possible card, but as it stAnds it's just a slog.  
Just some old games which I played before knowing of others: **Monopoly** , **Risk**, **Settlers** etc. 

Also many short games I couldn't care less for like **Love letter** but if I have to play this because other people like it it's not a big deal. 


Reversi (Othello). Simpler than the other games already mentioned and that was its final downfall. My wife and I figured out the move that meant you won and it was inevitable from that point on. It took us a while but once we got there, it was over.
*Red Dragon Inn*.

It's decent enough as a light game, but my group loved it so much and always wanted to play it to the point where it makes me sick just to look at the box.
**Secret Hitler**. It was back when I'm still very new to the hobby, and play a bunch of it. Slowly I realized how bad I am at lying.
**Coup**

It's an ok game to play maybe once or twice, but my group doesn't understand how to just stop after that.  After two hours of it you just get way past burnt out.  There's just not enough meat to the game nor cleverness to keep me into it.
OP here from the other thread! This list is just as helpful in helping me decide on a new game so I decided to keep an updated list of the most mentioned ones here (minimum 3 mentions). Hope it helps someone decide on (or against) a game in the future!

Have you played Starfarers of Catan OP?
 
If you have not, and somebody suggest playing it and happens to have a copy of it, I implore you to not let that Catan name fool you and play this game.
 
It's nowhere near the best game out there, but I promise you will have a blast.
I'll probably end up playing it again because my group loves it, but after about 60 plays I'd be ok with not playing **Splendor** again
I'm not gonna say that I never want to play **Cosmic Encounter** again, since I can enjoy it a bit as a wacky activity with good people, and I don't want to deny the experience to friends who love it. I do think it's the most overrated game there is right now (a 5/10 or 6/10 game that is on many amazing reviewers' top 10 games). I've also played it over 30 times, though, so unlike other games that I might call overrated, I'm pretty sure my opinion isn't rooted in ignorance of the game. When Cosmic lovers talk about the great tactics that haters must not grok, I grok them every single time, and just don't think these are generally good features of a game.
**Puzzle Strike**. I got the first edition as a gift. For the first couple games I think we probably played it as the designers intended, picking random characters and buying a little of everything and doing OK. But after several games we realized all of the action chips were just dreadful, you win by buying basic attacks and money, and Argagarg is crazy unbeatable.

Now, I'd played Dominion which goes through a similar phase, "Hey we can just buy money" but you eventually climb that hill and the gameplay shines once you get good at it. So, my roommate and I grinded through about 10-15 more 2-player games with different characters trying to beat the very simple, "play Argagarg, only buy basic attacks" strategy but... No, there's just nothing there. So finally I checked the internet to see, what's the deal? Are we strategically inept or is the game this unbalanced?

And the answer is... Yeah the game is just that unbalanced, you can't beat basic attacks in 1st edition. They released a 2nd and 3rd edition which fixed the game. The new editions made all of the actions in the game $1-$2 cheaper, they made basic attacks drain your money, they made Argagarg much worse. Pretty much fixed everything but, man what do I do with my broken game? I can't bring myself to throw it in the garbage but I'm certainly never going to play it again.
**Betrayal At House On The Hill**

After ten games, you've seen all of the cards. 

After twenty games, you've seen most of the haunts and probably a handful more than once.

After thirty, I never want to open the box again. I don't think the expansion is going to fix that for me...
Magic the gathering....
Kingsburg and Illuminati
*Arctic Scavengers*.  When we first got it, it was pretty amazing.  A deckbuilder with a bit more thematic punch than dominion, a way to push your luck, and actual real bluffing and interaction between players.  But now?  A dozen games after one of the first games I actually bought, it just seems so light on substance and staying power.   Even Dominion has all those expansions. Scavengers just doesn't have a spark to drag me away from Cosmic Encounter and Inis anymore.  
**Bang: The Dice Game**.   It can be fun with the right crowd, but with our usual group it's becomes a tedious, passive aggressive exercise in kingmaking.  Every game the same few people will be targeted and killed immediately, regardless of whose side they are on and it's just boring.  Even the new expansion didn't save this one.
The Resistance. 

Good game, don't get me wrong. But honestly it all comes down to who can yell the loudest and who is liked the most for no apparent reason. Everything is circumstantial and while it can be fun, it can also just be a headache and a half.
*Code Names*. Great game, fun, and very well made. But, holy hell, I've played this more times than I'll ever want to. The thing is that it's easy to get into, and rounds are super short. So we usually end up playing it for like 6+ straight hours. That's fine, but then no one wants to play anything else. I prefer the complex, thematic games where the group gets lost in the story of the play session. Code Names isn't one of those.  

Similarly, *Cards Against Humanity* has lost all flavor for me. I appreciate the designers and the silliness of it all, but the game's novelty wears off once the combinations become just that: getting the right combo. Once you know Sarah loves dead baby jokes, you know exactly what kind of lucky hand you need to get win her over. There's no real system of correct/incorrect answers, so the game becomes a battle of "who is lucky enough to give the judge a card they think means they know them best?" To someone who games for the challenge and the creative aspects, this system got stale years ago.
I think that Caverna needs at least a long rest, before I will play it again. I love the game, but it has gotten dull. And my girlfriend always beats me in two-player games.

Now she is consistently beating me in A Feast for Odin :-(
**The Resistance**. I've told this story before. When everyone opened their eyes, during my last game of this, one player accused two others right off the bat, and refused to change his mind. Absolutely refused. There was plenty of evidence that the two he was accusing were innocent, and that two other players were the guilty ones, but he just would not change his mind. He was so stubborn, nothing would change his mind. He just sat there, saying it's "A & B". He wouldn't approve teams containing either people. Needless to say, we lost the game and I've never been able, or willing, to play it since.
Dominion for sure. We went through a phase of playing it online, and maybe I'd play it again that way, but playing it in the flesh? No way. 
Risk. It was the first real game I ever played, and my group of guys was really into it. We played twice a weekend for almost a year. We even made a TERRIBLE short film about it. God it was so bad.
Monopoly is the obvious answer for me. I can play pretty much every other game, as long as the downtime isn't too long. 
Dominion. My friends and I went on this whole Dominion thing for a good bit of my first semester at university. We literally have played all the expansions and I used to be up until 5am playing online with them. Do I regret it? No. But I don't think I have it in me to play it again.
Probably cosmic encounter. It's a great game but when I think about it critically it's still very randomized and less skill based. Not my kind of game. 
**Ascension**: It was one of our first modern board games so we played it all the damn time. I had a lot of fun with it and am grateful for it giving me an nice intro into the hobby. But I've since found more interesting deckbuilders that fit my likes/interests better. Marvel Legendary is my go to Ascension-style buy from a constantly changing row game and Trains plus the Rising Sun expansion is my favorite Dominion-style marketplace game. The added board/area control element is a great touch as well.
There's never a game I've got to 30 plays with that I won't play again.

There are games I won't play with certain people again.

Muchkin and Cards against Humanity will never again see play in my gaming group. We know all the cards, how it plays and they've lost impact.

But finding a new gamer and using those to introduce them into the hobby as I did? Yep. I find a whole new set of fun in helping others begin that journey (and from a selfish point of view, if I get Munchkin and CAH out of their system early, we can move on to something really satisfying)
For me, it's **Dead of Winter**.  Theres one guy in our group who knows every single card, from the secret objectives to the crossroads deck.  He'll always figure out (or says he's figured out) everyones objective.  He'll know the outcomes of each of the crossroads and basically tell us what we have to do.  He's kinda ruined the game for me.
52 pickup. 
**Star Realms** for me.  For about 2 months, the phone app was the greatest thing ever.  I... can't, anymore.  It's just not enough game for that many plays.
Baldurs Gate 2!

Ooops wrong sub.

And wrong thread.

I regret my actions.
CHina Town and the Original Ticket to ride, though more of I want a break since my wife and sister in law really only like playing those two games.
I think **Cyclades** would be it for me. I don't have actual counts on have many plays of it I have - it might just be in the 20s or so. Still, close enough :)

Anyway. Friend of mine got it years ago, shortly afterwards we and our boardgaming group went to a summer house for a few days holiday over the summer break from uni. During those few days we played it *a ton* and really dug into the game and loved it to bits. We also played it quite a lot afterwards for some time. Also really enjoying it. At some point my friend got the Hades expansion, which sadly fell a bit flat (it doesn't integrate smoothly with the base game), and interest diminished at some point.

Though now, I feel like I've had my fill of it, and I'm not too keen on playing it again. While we haven't "solved" the game in the usual sense, I just feel like I've explored the game to its fullest. Plus, there are some minor annoyances with it - for instance, game ends due to a Zeus shuffle for a pegasus or similar. I know the Hades expansion removes this particular problem, but it just feels like a bit of a bloated expansion that's bolted onto an otherwise beautifully streamlined game. I think it'd require the Titan expansion for me to - maybe - rekindle my interest in the game.
I think I've managed to avoid playing **Catan** 30 times, but if I *have* played it 30 times, it's at the top of this list.

Also, **Dominion** 70+ plays and completely burned out on it, **Ticket to Ride**.


Just so you don't think I'm biased against gateway games, I still like ** Carcassonne** and love **Bohnanza**.
I'm so sick of Risk Legacy. It was interesting the first few times we played but now that we've unlocked all the expansions there's nothing that really excites me about it anymore. Unfortunately the guy who owns it really wants to complete the board, which I do understand. He's really into it. We have a weekly game night but all we had been playing for the last few months was Risk Legacy until I suggested we did a brief dungeon crawl in Pathfinder. We probably have only one more session of that though before it's back to freakin Risk.

Edit: I guess we probably haven't quite done 30+ plays of it but it has been Enough.
Settlers of Catan. It's not a bad game (though it does have some flaws), but I played it so much for so long that I never want to play it again.
That being said, I still have my copy because I am grateful for the fact that Settlers got me started in this hobby around 10 years ago. I keep it out of nostalgia.
Catan, Ticket To Ride (Base Game), Cards Against Humanity.
Betrayal at the house on the hill. It's the only game my group of friends ever want to play. 
Cards against humanity loses its charm pretty quick unfortunately. I haven't touched it in almost two years. It used to be the go to for big groups but it's just not fun once you know ask the cards. 
Cards Against Humanity
**Star Realms**

Got the game, played a lot with a few people, noticed how utterly luck driven, and low on decisions that game really is. Now, I will not play that game ever again. I actually even despise it. It's a non game disguised to be a game, and because of that it's way too high on any lists.
**The Resistance** was one we used to play all the time, and I'm burnt out by secret role party games now.
**Puerto Rico** and **Caylus**

After a large number of plays the small flaws and always optimal strategies started taking over. At this point, I will likely never play them again.
**Cards Against Humanity** and **The Resistance**

Also settlers of catan.  I and my group played it no less than a hundred times, maybe more. We have a bunch of expansions, but we usually stuck with cities and knights and seafarers. We'd play anything from 3 person games to 6 person games. Big and small maps, game rules and house rules. We've seen literally everything the game has to offer, and most of us have won dozens of times each. We're done with it. It has nothing left to offer us.
Monopoly
Vanilla **Ticket To Ride** as in just the USA map, I can't even count how many times I've played it because I have a cousin who loves it so much. Luckily I purchased **Ticket To Ride Rails and Sales** and he loved that even more, so I'm sure I'll get sick of that soon. 
I'm still in recovery on **7 Wonders**. Excellent game, but my board game group leaned too heavily on it for a while since it was one of the few games that we could agree/accommodate the size of our group. Adding the **Leaders** expansion helped a lot but more than a few people in the group refuse to use **Babel** even though it's an interesting mechanism to me. 
Munchkin. Never again.
CAH, Pandemic, Betrayal at House on the Hill, any MTG format that isn't Legacy, Vintage, or Cube. 
Chess. I'm just bad at it.
Monopoly
Catan :-(
Mage Knight, I'll still be in my 26th full game the day I die from old age though... No seriously, this game is just to much rules and stuf, teaching it to new players every other time... Wish it was more streamlined.
Resistance. 

It literally is the game that ruins friendships, and I am one of the only people in my friend group that doesn't care for it anymore. It's not fun, and it only sparks arguments.
Dominion, Settlers of Catan are Cards Against Humanity.

I still like Dominion, but nowhere near as much as I used to and there's always something I'd rather play.
After reading some response: Cards Against Humanity...I'm surprised that it happened, but I got tired of dick jokes...at least in the CAH sense. 
Monopoly.
Last Night on Earth.  I'll always bust it out for less familiar friends, but for me the Zombies just do nothing in the game, it's so boring and based on your draw.  Also the Zombies just really seem weak, either you get the win early (disappointing all human players), or you just dawdle around while the humans go about trying to beat the scenario.

It's more or less a PVE game packaged as a PVP. In fact we've played a few times as PVE.  It's ok in that regard but even then I think Zombies have won less than 5 games out of maybe 40 times played, and every time they won it was remarkably unsatisfying.
It was *Pandemic* hence I wasn't interested in the Legacy version at all. Glad I believed in the hype though as now I'm a Pandemic Legacy fan boy.

Still no real desire to play vanilla *Pandemic* again.
**Coup**  
  
So tired of this game and games like it.  
  
That said, this game is a great way to get casual/new gamers into more interesting games. I've successfully taken one friend who's most complex gaming experience was Risk, convinced him to play Coup, then moved straight on to Lords of Waterdeep.
MtG, Settlers, Dominion, CAH, Risk, Axis and Allies, Small World, anything with "Rails" or "Train" or "Ticket" in the title, Smash Up, illuminati.

I'd actually play any of them if the other person wants to play, pays attention, takes 3-5 minutes or less per turn and doesn't whine when losing or want to look at rules every 5 minutes.  Except MtG - never again. 
Risk. I hate rolling dice, especially when it's the very last battle and you have 100 vs 100 armies.
I think the only game I've played that many times and don't wish to play again is **Magic: the Gathering**. It's been probably 10 years since last played anyway. I would much rather play Netrunner!
It's possible that I've reached the bottom of **The New Era**, but I bet I haven't.
Werewolf - Every party, get together, birthday. ugh I've never liked the game and I especially hate it now. 
Cards against humanity and Monopoly.
Risk.  I hate that game. My hatred of it grew exponentially after I found axis and allies. It's basically risk that doesn't suck.
**Splendor**. I played it, I enjoyed it, but now I feel like there's nothing left to experience with that game. Variability through card decks only goes so far.  

I also second nods to **Apples to Apples** and its offshoots.
Bang! I've played this card game so many times with my friends, we all started to hate it
I am grateful to **Puerto Rico** for being my gateway into the culture of board games, but it's served it's purpose and can go away now. 
I hate to say it because it's such a fun game, but **Eight-Minute Empire**. I would absolutely kill to have more boards, but I doubt that's ever going to happen. It might be worth investing in the newer version, but it looks like an almost entirely different game.
Mens erger je niet. NEVER AGAIN!

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Mens_erger_je_niet_02.jpg

https://s.s-bol.com/imgbase0/imagebase3/extralarge/FC/1/1/4/7/1004004000017411.jpg
Risk is #1 with a bullet. Also Small World. I used to at least enjoy it on iPad, but I'm completely sick of it in that form, too. Never again. 
Basically, I get tired of games when I replay them too much so namely:

**Settlers of Catan**: It's gotten to the point where I've won too much and I can never win again because everyone just gangs up on me.

**Codenames**: I love the idea, but after so many games, it just doesn't have enough variety to keep it exciting.

**Munchkins**: I'm tired of trying to be the last one to 9. Alternatively, spending the entire game as a cleric hoping 
for divine intervention.

**King of Tokyo**: I found this game to be too much luck for me.
Bang. 
Monopoly
* **Star Realms**

* **The Resistance**
I'm burned out on the Game of Thrones Board game. The problem is that, especially when playing with essentially the same group, the game is too predictable. There are only a handful of viable strategies for any given house, and at this point the core members of our group know them pretty well. Even with tide of battle cards and wilding cards, theres not much variety between each 6 hour game. 

It doesn't help that people tend to play the same houses consistently(mostly due to investment in the show). 
Pandemic Legacy anyone?
That game just didnt click with me and the fact that you have to play it many times to finish  didn't help.
 One of our player  as well suffers from the "Pandemic syndrom", playing others turns and taking twenty minutes himself  for his own turn, refusing  our suggestions. 
The game is definitely interesting and I understand why ppl love it . At least I get to tear up card or two:) 
**Axis and Allies**

Played about 200 games over an 8 year period growing up. Often 3-4 a weekend between 16 and 19 years old. Went through about four copies. Have zero interest in ever playing again.
**Dominion.**
When it first came out, it was revolutionary and fantastic, if horribly unbalanced.  But as you get better and play with better and better people, it just devolves into a sort of math problem, instead of an actual game.
With Dominion, you look at the initial board, figure out your strategy, and play it through.  There's very little thinking on your feet compared to any other deckbuilder I've played.

And I've seen a lot of mentions of Monopoly in the thread, which is sort of the meme hated boardgame.  Honestly, I'd rather play through a game of Monopoly right now than any more Dominion.
Werewolf. Constantly played it when it didn't appeal to me to keep my friends happy. Pretty much ruined all hidden role games for me.
Five Tribes. My friends love this game, but it's grown a bit old after the 8th or 9th play. IMHO the game lends itself to action paralysis since all the information is on the table, and players can math out their opponents moves before acting. Also, the bidding system in relation to the gameplay is a bit off; a few times our group has found that the only profitable bid (based on how the meeples are arranged at that point in time) is the max, since any lower bid can be outbid, taking away the play that you are bidding for. 
Cards Against Humanity. And I'm getting there with Smash Up - I have a player who wants to play this and nothing but this, and it's wearing thin.
Cards Against Humanity, obvious reasons because I play with lots of non-board gamers usually and they always want to play it. 

Coup, because it was my first game with a group of buddies and nobody else wanted to buy anymore games and stuck to this for a few months. We started understanding how we each played and it got boring. Thank the lord I started donating plasma and working so I could feed my hunger for different games. 
Cards Against Humanity :/ although anyone here probably could've seen that coming. 
* **Cosmic Encounter** 
* **Diplomacy**
* **Robo Rally**
* **Roll for The Galaxy**
* **Fury of Dracula**
* **Codenames**
* **Coup**
* **Werewolf**
* **Avalon**

Anything driven by lying, guessing and negotiation is not for me, personally. I'm also not fond of chaotic outcomes and would rather play a game that is clear and decision driven at all stages. 
**Boss Monster** my siblings adore it but I can't get past how luck based it is. It's gotten to the point where I sit down with 10 other great games and hum "so what shall we play?" only to feel my feet be pulled out from beneath me as long shadows and menacing little smiles fill their pointy teethed faces. Trapped. Cherubs.
Cosmic Encounter.  A simple poker game where alien powers turn the basic rules into delicious and hilarious chaos.
* Splendor  
  
* Ticket to Ride USA  
  
* Love Letters  
  
* King of Tokyo  

* Catan  
* Carcassonne  
  
Smash up. It was the first board game I bought. Kinda wore it out.
Betrayal at House on the Hill. I've got a group of friends that loves this game. Every time we get together it's the first game they want to play. And then they usually want to play it again. It was interesting the first few times, but after 6 years, I'm thoroughly sick of the game. 
Everytime someone mentions "Cards Against Humanity" I cringe a little. I have the cards memorized. It's not even funny.
A lot of well known games that are well loved by people who mostly play those and no others. Examples: **Carcassonne**, **Settlers if Catan**, **Munchkin**, **Ticket to Ride**, **Ingenious**. That's mostly enough for one life, thank you very much. I'd rather play something more fun nowadays. 
Netrunner
These games are for Canadians! Get out of here with your OP USD!
EVERYTHING is on sale there! I just dropped 250 fat ones on random games.
Wow. Ordered. Thank you OP I honestly didn't think I was ever going to be able to justify this game but at that price it's mine. Is this really the last print run for a while? That makes this even more fortuitous.
I got away easy only giving 401 $120 this weekend. 
For all you Americans, Cardhaus also has 10% off everything. **Food Chain Magnate** is cheaper there as well.
Pretty cheap if you pre order it directly from splotter. Like 75 euros
Awesome! I just bought it! It was $40 cheaper from that site, compared to my FLGS! Huge thanks for this post. I was worried I would never get this game too.
This blog doesn't really talk about negotiation in board games, it just talks about board games that have negotiation in them. What is negotiation? What are its consequences on gameplay? Is it becoming more or less common in games? What are some strategic considerations that go along with negotiation? Are there any ways to think about negotiation in general? 
I mostly despise negotiation games with a fiery passion, because they tend to 1) be very antagonistic, 2) go on forever, and 3) have arbitrary outcomes.

It's interesting that Tassie mentions one of my few exceptions, **Pit**, which is a short game that's too ridiculous to get people angry.
I generally avoid games that allow negotiations because I think people don't make decisions solely based on in-game info.
 I don't know what to think about negotiation in board games.  On the one hand, it's a great way for players who are behind to make a trade and give each other an advantage to help catch up.  On the other hand, I can never get over the uneasy feeling that no player would offer a trade if they didn't think they were getting the better end of the deal somehow.  A certain amount of imperfect information is necessary to make trading interesting.

I made a strange discovery in Monopoly when I was growing up.  I started hiding one of my initial $500 bills underneath my property at one point and found that my family was more willing to trade with me under the belief that I wouldn't be able to buy houses or hotels on a follow-up turn.  Messy.
I like games with a lot of player interaction, so I am a fan of negotiation in games (even though I, like many others in this thread, am known as the hardcore gamer and thus should be treated with suspicion or colluded against from turn one).

But negotiation is very, very hard to get right.

Negotiation lead to trades between players.  There are three types of trades in boardgames: unforced but allowed trades, forced trades but with choice, and forced trades without choice.  Negotiation is a vital component of any trade with choice.

Why trade?  For unforced trades the parties involved always trade for some perceived improvement in their situation.  There are two very different flavors of 'improvement of a situation', though.  Players could trade for raw gain in their position or they could trade to reduce a loss.  These two flavors lead to very different dynamics.  If two players are trading and both expect to come out better at the end, it is friendly and it becomes a question of who gets the greater advantage.  If two players are trading both to reduce losses, there is a similar camaraderie with a bit of desperation thrown in.  However, if one is negotiating for a gain and the other to reduce a loss and they both know it, there can be a real mean element to the whole transaction.

Then there is the effect and the reaction of the third party in the negotiation -- everyone else at the table.

Asymmetric information or other information limiting schemes can blunt some of the sharper aspects but that comes with its own gameplay complications.

I personally think negotiation is an underutilized mechanic but I think that is because it is hard to get right.

I am looking forward to New Angeles because it seems like it has a lot of negotiation.  I am eager to see how well they pull it off.


Chinatown - still the best trading game. Pure trading with pure negotiation. 
I consistently have a problem playing negotiation-heavy games with players who either aren't great at negotiating or dislike that aspect or whatever, and it can really be the biggest flaw of the negotiation mechanic and in a much different way than being bad at other games.

Best example is a recent game of **Game of Thrones** where a player who was geographically right next to me did NOT understand what was happening and was interpreting my negotiations as a ruse, when in fact he was about to be steamrolled by another player. As such, I was disadvantaged and he was quickly eliminated, making the third player that much stronger for having taken advantage of the weakest player. Not many other mechanics allow you to exploit other's being bad or unfamiliar in the same way that negotiation can.

This has also been one of the things that has turned people off from Diplomacy, in my experience. They expect it to be a straight war game and are confused and irrirated when their plans seem unattainable. Without talking to the other players, you basically have no strategy.

That said, it is one of my absolute favorite mechanics when all players are into it on the same level.
It's impossible for my group to play any negotiating games. No one ever trades anything. 
One of the key reasons I stopped playing Munchkin was I grew tired of "friendly" negotiations to aid in combat - someone would offer to help for the least possible reward, meaning up until level 9 nobody lost a fight at all. If people start being nice to their friends all the time, how am I supposed to have any fun?
A lot of the complains about negotiation seem to ignore the fact that knowing how people will act helps you make better decisions and win. I'm known as one of the best gamers in my group and so people often don't want to trade with me, so I embrace that and play around it by emphasizing when I'm losing and emphasizing when others are winning. I also know who makes decisions based on feelings and other non-game info and abuse that by saying things when they are taking their turns or considering trades with other people. I love winning in these situations because people try to gang up but can't fully because I've already taken into consideration what they will do and try to counter act it. Board games where there is only 1 optimal move and you can always do it with no interference aren't as fun socially unless your whole group is really serious about games.
The main problem I have with negotiation games is that a simple mistake by one player can easily decide the game in favor of another player. So lots of careful strategic work can be done away with in seconds.

I find these games to be much more swingy than even card or dice games.
I may have posted something over on BGG along the lines of diplomacy and negotiation as a mechanic, The discussion drew out the Diplomacy (the game) players because I didn't rate it as an example and in there opinion it is the one and only. But there were lots of good suggestions for negotiation games, how it's a meta mechanic and what future game developers could do to incorporate it into their projects. Here's a link give it a read if curious. I do love diplomacy in games:

No one cares who Steve Tassie is. He is a nobody 
Making agreements not to attack each other in exchange for something is cheating. Full stop.


A few guesses as to what might have gone wrong:

1. The market is divided in two in steps 1 and 2: the current market and the future market. The market always rearranges so the four cheaper plants are in the current market. So you shouldn't have access to the REALLY great power plants until late in the game. (Also, the market at the start of the game is filled with the worst power plants, so it takes time to refill with good stuff.)

2. Each player is allowed only three power plants.

3. At the end of each round in steps 1 and 2, the most expensive power plant is put on the bottom of the deck. This means the best plants are usually available once step 3 arrives, and you usually need the best plants to power the most cities in step 3.

4. The game is a delicate balance of expanding your city network and expanding your powering capabilities. Turn order is very important, and the designer has said somewhere that the key strategy is not acquiring more power plants until you need them to cover the cities you have/will be getting. It sounds like you had a lot of excess power, which can upset the tempo of the game. Since you're all new players, it's not a huge deal, but an experienced player might have shown you the error of this way of playing. :-)
Seems like you've already figured out where you went wrong. To give you a sense of how the end game tends to play out, there's usually a race between two different strategies:

1. Those who want to build to 17 as soon as possible and end the game immediately, because they have somewhere between 15-17 houses of power/fuel.

2. Those who have excess capacity (17+) who need an extra turn to slingshot past those trying to end the game early.

For player type 1, usually it's about having those extra few dollars to build the 17th house one turn before type 2 is fully prepared to power and build 17-19 houses and power them. A lot of this is determined by which power plants come up when, and how aggressive people are on the board. The more you get a sense of the rhythm of the game, the more tight and tense the last few turns will get, as you have to start keeping track of more and more variables.
Did you only buy from the top 4 cards (active market)?

Did you reorder the cards when a new plant was added to the active/futures market?
>Also, one of us was ahead by a city and there wasn't a way for the other two to get ahead.

This sounds like you missed the balancing mechanism of the game?
The one who has the most cities, is the *first* who has to bid on a powerplant (disadvantageous) and the *last* who gets to buy resources (disadvantegous, because more expensive). That way the ones with less cities have a cheaper life, and thus at some point should be able to overtake.
> there wasn't a reason to keep buying Power Plants, resources, or to power any cities.

Even if you only buy one city connection per turn, it's strange that you felt no urge to neither buy resources nor power cities. 


Did you correctly buy and use your resources? Any power plant can stack up to the double of its needs (a 2 Charcoal plant may have up to 4 charcoal units) and you have to spend the resources to power your plants. These resources don't go back to the resource market, as the market is refilled at the end of the turn following a different scheme depending on the board, step and number of players. Did you correctly refill the resources market?  
> We had everything we needed to power 17 homes, we just had to wait until someone got there. 

The game only *ends* at 17 cities (or however many). 

You can  still build more than 17 cities. That's why the track goes to 21.

The game is scored by who can power the most cities.


In other words, if you can build and power 19 cities, you still beat the person who built 18 cities and powered 17 of them.

We played Power Grid on Saturday ourselves; it turned into a game of bidding wars, land grabs, and market dominance.
Hm, as I didn't watch you playing, hard to say.

Judging from your description: Just checking that you only powered your own homes? Remember you have only three slots for power plants? Less obvious: Did you always sort the spare row of power plants by price, putting the most expensive one under the pile? Powering 17 cities with three stations can only be done with quite expensive plants, which you shouldn't have been able to equip yourself (at least not *all* of you) before Stage 3 starts.
Were you playing power grid or power grid deluxe?  Here are some rules to double-check:

* Until step 3, only the top row of power plants in the market can be auctioned.  The power plant market is always ordered by minimum bid.

* You can have max 3 power plants at a time.

* In the bureaucracy phase, you only get income for the number of houses you powered THAT turn.  Use up resources for your power plants -> those power plants can power x number of your houses this turn.

* To build in a city, you must pay for both the house in the city and connection costs to the city.  First house in a city costs 10, second costs 15, third costs 20.

* In step 1, only one house can be in each city.  In step 2, only two houses.  In step 3, up to three.

In the time it took me to click the link, note the code, and add something to cart... The deal expired. 

Those Clash of Cultures wonders went from under $20 aud to over $40 :(
It's not bad. It's better at 3 or 4, but playable at 2. The number of workers and cattle cards scale down with fewer players, the only problem is that there are fewer buildings on the board. It changes the feel of moving around the board... makes it too easy.
In another comment, you said everything you are reading says it's no good for 2p. Genuine question: What are you reading?

On BGG, 8 people say it plays best with 2p, 28 people recommend it with 2p, and only 2 people **don't** recommend it with 2p! Those are very positive stats for 2p.
I've played multiple two person games and find it brilliant. Highly recommended here. While it's true that the logistics of getting around the board might not be as complicated as three or four players I suspect that the two player count will be a sweet spot for some gamers looking for less troubles on their turn. Players may also like that it's faster paced.
I haven't really looked into this title. 

How was the playtime? was there much player conflict/interaction?
If you're just looking for a strictly 2 player Star Trek game, I recommend Fleet Captains
Check out [Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31627/ticket-ride-nordic-countries). It's a map that's only 2-3 players, so it's designed for a much tighter 2 player game.
The 1910 expansion has a Big Cities set of tickets that basically have all the tickets connect to the same five or six cities, which tightens up the map for two players. 
Me and my wife just play where why each control two companies that are independent. It gives you a lot more to think about and the board actually gets crowded so you really have to plan out your routes, especially since you are competing with yourself in some ways.
Buy one of the 2-3 player maps. Problem solved
It is used to classify the move types.

Green is a symmetrical move

Blue is a move that goes to the Left

Red is a move that goes to the Right
For me it was Specter Ops. Saw it at Barnes and Noble for half off its original price and was like "Eh, what's the worst that could happen?"

Turns out it is a fantastic game.
Smash Up. Wasn't really my cup of tea. 
You won't regret buying Deception: Murder in Hong Kong. It's my favorite, and I'd play it every day if I could!

My answer is probably The Castles of Burgundy. I knew of it, and I knew it is very highly-rated and revered. I loved The Card Game version. So when I saw it for $25CAD, I snagged a copy and don't regret it one bit!

I also instinctively bought Multiuniversum when I noticed it was by Manuel Correia. Turns out to be a great, elegantly-designed game system, and I actually like it more than the Agent Decker print-and-play he released. I even crowdfunded the Cthulhu expansion for it.

I have bought tons of games with very little knowledge. Sometimes I just look at BGG's ratings, the player counts, the game length, and a couple pictures and that can sell me on a game. I've mostly been lucky so far.
**The Swarm**. I saw some of the art on it and knew it was based on some very popular German(?) book, but for the life of me I couldn't find out anything about it at the time (I think this was before I was aware of BGG or r/boardgames) but saw it selling for like $10 or something and figured, what the heck. 

Still haven't gotten it to the table yet, though...
I blindly purchased **Exploding Kittens** because of all the hype. Worst game in my collection.
When target was doing the buy 2 get 1 I picked up Oregon Trail without any knowledge of it beyond the premise of the computer game, but it is a ton of fun and really challenging
At Essen this year I bought a game called **A Dog's Life** for literally no other reason than the fact it had cute dog figures.  I am a sucker for dogs.  I haven't played it yet and honestly don't know if I ever will!  :D

/u/r2d8 getinfo
**An Infamous Traffic**. Ordered the first day it was available. I knew it was a tough econ game that was opaque (at best). That's about right... I need one more play of it before I'm ready to pass judgement. Before that might be **Traders of Osaka** I got in a trade without researching it much beyond reading the description and categories on BGG, haven't played that yet.
The very last game for me was Descent 2e that was today, don't have it yet lol. I also ordered Lancaster big box after reading about it on SUSD (I swear they had a video for it but can't find one so I guess I read it on their site). 

I purchased Amerigo on very little knowledge other than it was dirt cheap not that long ago and pretty fun. Ive played it 3 times I think and it will be a while before I master it and I did like it. 

I got Forbidden Desert because its a co op tile laying game like Burgle Bros, again it was on sale and is supposed to be fun. Haven't played it yet.. 

Are you seeing a trend?
I do it about 3/5 buys. My hunch very rarely is off. (I am looking at you, Munchkin!) 
I've only bought one, sight-unseen.  **Maginor**, off a clearance table.  Didn't care for it much and traded it away.

I've accepted several as trades though, without knowing much, if anything, about them.

 - **3012** - Almost a good game, but not quite.  Traded it away.
 - **Age of Conan: The Strategy Board Game** - Still haven't played it.
 - **Lungarno** - Nice little tile game.  Not great, but I'm keeping it in my collection.
 - **Ventura** - Still haven't played it.
 - **Black Fleet** - Not too bad.  It's a keeper, but probably won't get played very often.
 - **Long Live the King** - Read through the rules and decided I didn't even want to try it.  Traded it away.
 - **Homesteaders** - I liked it at first, but it got too samey and too mathy.  It stoppped being fun after a few plays.  Traded it away.

Oh and also won a couple from raffles:

 - **Pick-A-Polar-Bear** - Actually kinda fun to play with kids.
 - **Among the Stars** - Another "almost" game.  A lot of cool ideas, that just didn't quite work for me.  I tried adding in the first couple expansions, and that actually made it worse.  It's still taking up space on my shelf, since I can't seem to trade it away.

So, my track record isn't great.  I try to research everything before  getting it now.
First of all **Skull** is amazing and it might be the most played game in my collection. So much so that im thinking of buying another copy.

My last blind purchase was **Dogs of War**. I saw the components, read the SUSD review and decided to just buy it. I have no idea how the game plays but i think it will work with my group. It didnt arrive yet so i have no idea
I ordered **quantum** as it was on a big sale (something like -60%off) and had only read comments on the website. 

I then found that SUSD made a review of the game and was relieved since I usually have similar tastes as they do. 

The components & material can seem a bit odd, but I wasn't disapointed, the game is great. 

Still, I am much more cautious when ordering games now, I look up several reviews and check comments on BGG. So, lesson learned while getting a good game win/win
It was the first game I bought. I knew I was gonna like the hobby so I dove right in and bought **Caverna**, only because it was a heavy box.

Now I'm over 120 games. It was a nice blind buy.
**Skull** is a very "meh" game for me. I can see why others like it, but there's just not enough going on to hold my attention. You can play the game with bar coasters and a Sharpie.

As for my last blind buy - my FLGS had a Black Friday sale where they threw a bunch of their unsold titles up onto a table for 75% off. I picked up **6 nimmt!**, **Saboteur** and **Saboteur 2** for three bucks a piece. I enjoyed the first one, but haven't actually played the others yet.
Since I'm a broke college student I don't get much chance for blind buys, but the last one I did get was The Great Fire of London. Pretty good game, I need to find our invent some ways to make it more destructive but still good
Arctic Scavengers, was posted on my local FB trade group for half the price of retail so I jumped on it because I heard through people on here that it was near the top of the pile when it comes to the deckbuilder genre. I thought Dominion was fun, but dry, so the idea of the same mechanics with a better theme got me excited. One of the best purchases I've ever made, I love it, group loves it, SO loves it.
I bought **Jailbreakers: Plan Your Escape** on kickstarter, and I kinda regret it. The game is decent, but the rules are really bad (we had to house rule like 5 out of the 7 item cards due to lack of clarity).  
I bought **Harry Potter: Hogwart's Battle** with very little knowledge about it, but that turned out pretty well. Played it about 20 times so far and I still enjoy it.
Most of games were bought this way. The last one is ***Mombasa***. I haven't opened it yet. 
Just try it with them and see! Lots of "bad games"  have plenty of fans. They may just love it
I enjoyed it, silly fun, easy to learn. 
It is not a good game for adults,  and unfortunately many reviewers will review it from an adult perspective.  I've never played it with kids but I could see them enjoying it. It has simultaneous play with only two decisions per round, so it moves quickly at least and handles more players better than games where everyone takes a turn. 

If you can get your kids into the Chutulu theme I could see it as good,  silly fun.  Maybe encourage them do a Chutulu face every time they place their monster. 
My house. I have it. Never play it. Only looked at the cards a few times. Message me, maybe we can work something out. I'll email you pictures or something.
Been looking for mine over a year now. Think I gave it away or left it at a party etc. Definitely fun in a group/teams.

You obviously didn't look too hard on Amazon, because it's listed for $10.  
  
Try again, it's not that difficult.
I played the Escape the Room game you linked to last, and it was just my wife and I playing. It was over in under an hour, and we just breezed through it. It was pretty much a waste of money in my opinion.
I kickstarted Escape Room in a Box but still haven't received my copy. The reviews seemed to be pretty good though which was a big part of why I backed it. I played Escape The Room Stargazer's Manor and it was way too simple for our group. It says two hours but we went through in about 30 minutes and were never really challenged by the puzzles. But it was only $22 so if you're planning on playing with kids or something for a family night, it would work well. I haven't heard of Escape Room: the game but am now interested in checking it out. 
Escape The Room has more but simpler puzzles. Also has many more physical components to play with.

Escape Room: The Game has four themed "rooms" in the box. The puzzles are definitely harder and the key checking system is nicer too.

Both games can be reset and repackaged to sell on once you have finished. Have heard there may be expansion plans for ERTG though.
I played two games of Escape Room. I really liked it and it was pretty challenging. Looking back the puzzles weren't too hard, but with the timer and everything it made it fun.
I was hoping to like Escape the Room but from what other people are saying it sounds pretty easy.
According to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5ebkfr/has_anyones_asmodee_holiday_sale_order_been/) they are shipping on Wednesday, Nov 28th.

I believe that occurs in 2020, so we can expect to get our games in about four years.
There is a pretty extensive thread on BGG/Hot Deals about this not sure what their conclusion has been but they aren't too happy either.
I can't really work up any indignation. They probably get a few orders a week most weeks, then got a couple thousand at once. I'm sure I'll get my games. 

EDIT : Just got my shipping confirmation. Scheduled to arrive tomorrow. 
Thank you for contacting Fantasy Flight Customer Service... oh wait, this is just a forum? Hmm...

I think at this point, your game is LOST FOREVER and you should take it all the way to the highest court in the land!
Tweet at them? Not really. Do you have a receipt. 
They charged your card?  I have an order number but they have yet to take the money.
They get the games for free. They almost certainly make money off their reviews by way of ads, or have other revenue streams like Kickstarter, Patreon, merchandise, etc. If they don't feel like they get the games for free, please tot up the cost of the games they reviewed, and see what kind of cost is then incurred, set against their revenue. I'm betting for a lot of people, that will be non-trivial.

Not picking on you HC, I think free copies for reviewers is the norm, but I think a lot of reviewers are also doing nothing more than unofficial PR for those games they feature. That's the state of the industry currently. Just note you got a review copy provided by the publisher/designer etc and move on, nothing to see here. When every other journalist and critic reforms and starts paying for everything, join them. Until then...
I think you're getting a lot of negative feedback here because this post is both vague and immediately standoffish.

If you'd started with "HeavyCardboard here - we've been getting a lot of negative comments recently, mostly about the review copies that game publishers send us without compensation," this wouldn't be such a weird post.
Would you have invested your time in the hobby otherwise?

I spent 10-30 hours playing games over the Thanksgiving holiday, on games that were paid for.

Are you now stating that you may in fact be undercompensated for your review efforts?  Because you spend so much time and only get your "not free" game?


Big fan of the show, but if you don't pay for a game, then you got it for free. There's an expectation of a review, usually, but that's the definition of free lol
I don't know what you planned to accomplish with this post. You just come across as yelling at clouds from a position that a lot of people would find enviable. 

If being given games at no charge with the understanding that you'll play them several times and post your experiences with them is such a burden, *stop doing it.* 

I don't watch your show, but if this is your attitude about doing reviews I'm rather disinclined to try.
There are some reviewers, for any product, that receives a product for free. Usually it's larger known reviewers. And said larger known reviewers have advertisements, have sponsors, and/or have a Patreon page. No one is doubting that you don't put work into the review. But you obviously love board gaming, so it probably doesn't seem like a big deal to you. We love board games and we like honest reviews. This isn't saying no one is giving reviews that aren't honest. It seems like a small minority of people complaining about free games. 
To play Devil's Advocate just a bit, you are paid for your work, are you not? I mean, it's the equivalent of a very, very part time job, but still, I think there are quite a few of us who kind of pay you all to do what you do, right?

Review copies are free when given to reviewers in return for a review. Your time, that you choose to invest in reviewing and playing, is in fact, your choice to do, especially if this is still just a hobby within a hobby and not in fact a job like some have made it. 

I mean, come on, if you felt as if they weren't "free" why would you feel the need to articulate that you were indeed given a copy for review by said publisher, I mean after all, your time is just as valuable as your money, right? 

:) 


I seriously don't understand why this upsets you. In terms of money, you do not pay anything for the game in which you receive, so by definition it is free. Your review takes time, but any time after that you own a game that you didn't pay for.  
  
Some people would absolutely love the idea of being given a game (that they might be buying anyway), to take the time to play and review it (which they might be doing anyway), and not have to pay for it. You were the one who chose to do this and honestly I'm not sure what you're looking for here.
> Tell me again how that's "Free"?

It's free because you skip this step:
> you pay in cash

Kinda joking, kinda not, but realistically, how many people out here are saying "Reviewers just get tons of free stuff for nothing!" You're not getting it for nothing--you're getting it because you're a low-cost-low-barrier means of advertising for the publisher. The game is "free" to you in the same way the marketing is "free" to the publisher--no cash is exchanged the way it typically would be for both those things, but it's paid for in other ways.
Well, as a consumer, then I guess I'm not only spending money on a game, but also spending many, many hours researching games, watching/reading reviews and play-throughs, participating in discussions online and IRL.  Not to mention all the time playing games.  When you look at it like that, board games are insanely expensive.

I don't mean to make light of your argument.  I don't believe reviewers just sit around and "get free stuff".  But, you're coming across in a negative way.  If you don't enjoy what you do, why do it?  If you enjoy what you do, what are you complaining about?
>Tell me again how that's "Free"?

 You have given zero money for the game.

>So at a minimum, above the time spent playing the game, a reviewer (again, using myself as the example here) is spending 10-30 hours per review copy received, on their review.

 Are you making any money for this? Do advertisers or sponsors pay you anything?

In my opinion, if you are doing it as a hobby, without receiving pay, then your time is paying for the game. If you're doing it as a business and receive money then you're being paid for your time.
Stop playing the victim all the time.  The reason people said "100% zOMG whyyyyyy?" is because you clearly had a very poorly defined conversation, and you don't like what you're hearing.  Furthermore, complaining about how your thread is received on reddit just makes you sound whiney.  
Plenty of people do reviews for games that they pay for with cash. They aren't getting review copies sent to them. It's pretty common knowledge that when people say they got a game for free it's that they didn't pay cash.

Furthermore a lot of companies outside the board game realm actually prohibit this practice for a variety of reasons. If you are relying on a publisher to provide games then are you less likely to give a bad review? Consumer Reports for example buys everything they review, including cars, at retail in secret. Also nobody is keeping any items after they are reviewed.

Also this isn't charity, you guys do sell ads on your podcast and you have a patreon. So one could argue all the time you spend isn't to pay for the game it's to get listeners so you can sell ads or put on things like heavycon.
I replied earlier, but I felt it necessary to respond to the edit. If the OP came from posts on BGG and twitter, it would've been much more productive to link the applicable discussion instead of ranting on reddit. If you had framed your post into: "Hey we're heavy cardboard and this is a trend we're seeing in the reviewing community, what do you think?" instead of an emotional rant, it would have generated much better discussion.  
  
> And fwiw, I linked this over on Twitter and I was hit with 100% 'zOMG whyyyyy?' from media folks and regular games alike. That's a shame on so many levels. :(  
  
This edit legitimately made me mad, it reeks of "wah, people on reddit are being mean to me!" If you don't want to be here, don't be here. If you want to be part of the community at /r/boardgames, then do so. Try to fix what you think is wrong, try to add positive discussion, but instead you post an emotional rant and expect sympathy without context?! Good gracious. /r/boardgames is for hobby board gamers, not for content creators. I don't see people in /r/NFL ranting because they aren't inclusive enough of the players/coaches. I realize it's a different dynamic but it's a valid comparison.
Review copies aren't free because you are tied down to your credentials as a boardgame reviewer that you will play their game, and give a fair review of it (whether your sugar coat the review or not is completely up to you.)

However, the game is still technically from a monetary perspective, if we disregard Time and Materials necessary for the review. I am not saying Time and Materials isn't worth its own monetary value, but you are receiving a board game for "free" (because you did not have to fork over any physical money). But, still costs quite a bit because of the Time and Materials that you have to do as a reviewer.

TL:DR: Really depends on what you define as a "free". 
> When a reviewer (using myself as an example here) receives a game, they may do an unboxing video either on Periscope or their Youtube channel. Then they play it 4-10 times. Then they may spend upwards of 4-10 hours writing their notes/outline/script for their review. Then they record their review. Then they spend 4-10 hours editing what they recorded. Then they upload it and have to spend more hours promoting their review.

Never has my life been summarized in such a dry, sad paragraph. 
Are reviewers contractually obligated to do put in these hours for their reviews? Maybe it matters the publisher, idk, honestly asking? 


If it's a crap game do you put in those 4-10 games even though it's crap? If it's a great game, and you would have got in those 4-10 games regardless of being a reviewer, does that matter? I don't have an issue either way, just questions I had.
Are you reporting these games as part of your business/personal taxes?  If not, it's free.
>eta: For context, this came from various posts on BGG and twitter where folks are talking about integrity in reviewers and what reviewers should do with review copies of games when they finish with the review. Some feel that selling them is ok, others notsomuch. Donating them is ok, others say that regardless of what you do with it, it takes money out of the publishers pockets. So that's where this comes from. Sorry if I posted this without that context.

So, you're mad people are mad at you/think you get stuff for free? K.
I find it surprising (maybe I shouldn't?) at how many (most?) see cold hard cash as the only currency to define "free". 

If I have someone build me a fence and instead of paying them with cash, in return I fix their car, would you consider either side getting those things for free?


I wouldn't bother attempting to rationalize the internet's opinions on reviews and journalism in gaming in 2016, they're too far gone.
I agree 100% with OP. You provided a service to the game publisher, you are being paid with a copy of the game. What you decide to do with that copy is up to you.
Yup, I certainly appreciate how much work goes into them, plus also finding the time to replaying the game all those times in a short period of time.  I make appearances here and there on a podcast, but I'd never accept a review copy of a game to even review on there (where someone else does the editing, and I just have to waffle on) as I know I wouldn't want to, nor probably be able to, play it enough times quickly enough to be able to give it a properly researched review.

I certainly appreciate the time all reviewers put into their reviews and I'm sure if you worked out the hourly rate of time spent vs the game's cost you'd be on less then minimum wage (though I know that's not the reason you do it, anyway).
I can get on board with that sentiment, reviewers do put in additional work when they get a "free" game because they are expected to review it and create content, which is a part of that line of work.  It occurs in every industry and with almost any product, and the cost of the item is generally less than the cost of the invested time of the content creator, which is something most folks don't realize unless they've done peer-review work in the past.   

I also think most folks also don't realize that reviewers need to get through the games they are sent in a timely manner, and while playing lots of games is fun, having to slot specific games into specific times (and a lot of them) is less so.  Even if your average game runs $50 and someone spends only 20 hours on a review (plays and write up/production), they've effectively been "paid" 2.50 an hour to create that content.   

So from one dude who spent probably five hundred hours doing freelance peer-review work in grad school and made enough for a few tanks of gas and a nice dinner, hats off to ya.
I can't get over how well **Alchemists** does this.  When you say things like "I'm publishing a theory about this ingredient, based on my research" and "I'm a bit iffy about placing my most prestigious seal on this theory, since it is based partially on the yet unproven ideas of my opponent", you are describing things quite accurately in terms of both mechanics and theme.  They are one and the same.  To get any closer to "theme = mechanics" in this game, you'd need to be actually mixing real ingredients and drinking things in real life, and I can understand why that is not a part of the game, though it could be interesting.
Viticulture seems extremely well thought-out to me. Everything you can do seems to fit the theme and makes sense to me.
I'd say pretty much most of the **Sierra Madre Games titles** - especially the "Pax" series of small card games (with Pax Renaissance being the one that really has my attention lately - I mean it has everything: religious wars, peasant uprisings, jihads and crusades, vassalization, trade concessions, and bankers... yeah, you're a medieval banker trying to manipulate European events - or at least survive them - and the board is really just a 2 x 6 tableau of cards).  Then again, I'm a sucker for the themes and might be a bit biased... I mean, Bios Megafauna has a very tacked on scoring system to make it barely a game, but all the other mechanics of speciation and adding new genetic traits or evolving into an entirely new phenotype is as fun as playing SimCity 4/Deluxe.  Add in potential catastrophic events, constantly changing biomes, continental separation, a change from mesozoic to cenozoic, and the constant threat of going either to a Venusian-like hot death or a Snowball Earth in the background all suck me into the narrative of the game.  If anything, people probably might not like the seeming randomness of his games - but nature is truly random and chaotic.  (As to his more historical games, they take a different twist on the motives of revolution or the agent you represent - in Pax Porfiriana you start out as wealthy businessmen who most likely will topple the Mexican government in the early 20th century, in Pax Pamir you are a smaller Afghan tribes trying to gain political prominence in the shadow of the mighty British and Russian empires as well as a nationalist movement, and again in Pax Renaissance you are a banker.  The first and last are based on board/war games of the "Lords of the ____ series" - Sierra Madre and Renaissance respectively.)

I also have to say the **COIN series** is also really good.  The irregular pieces that flip between underground/hidden and revealed, the inequality of military capabilities between sides, the difference in special actions each faction can take, and the highly varied goals that takes to achieve them.  The next turn card gives you some foresight into upcoming political events but you have a degree of uncertainty as to when you check for victory conditions.

The grand-daddy of theme + mechanics for me has to be **Twilight Struggle**.  Everything in that game creates a tense tug-of-war feeling with a sense of imminent nuclear doom despite being highly abstracted in the nature of the conflicts.  Maybe your US policies are focused on Eastern Block countries, but then you discover that the USSR is playing a long game and building up alliances in Central America and Africa while holding you off long enough in Europe; coups and realignments cause constantly changing geopolitical events, sometimes actions will give an opponent a strong response (playing a card for ops points that has an opponents event triggers that event); the score track is a back-and-forth single track that each opponent is trying to pull to their 20 VP spot; and the DEFCON levels raise nuclear tensions while the space race and "The China Card" add more conflict and tension in the background.  My preference is for 1989: Dawn of Freedom (which covers the "final year" of Eastern Bloc communism/the Cold War and the year the Berlin Wall came down), but when talking about mechanics plus theme TS has is and 1989 is just a system utilizing the TS system.
Cash in guns has the theme of a Mexican Standoff and actually has players DO a Mexican Standoff.


Bonus points that all the classic "gunpoint banter" just naturally slips out with players going "You ain't gonna pull the trigger" or "put the gun down now" as you try to out posture and out bluff each other.
I've always felt **Yedo** does a nice job of blending the mechanics with the theme.
**Dune**. Oh Dune how I long for the backstabbing, spice rich, wartorn diplomatic quagmire of a 2 to 6 player (best with 6) strategy game. It fits hand in hand with the mechanics. Rex is a great reimplementation/reskin but **Dune is Dune**.
Someone else has posted about this on BGG before, but The Game is that perfect marriage. 

To quote from memory: "When i'm playing this game, i feel like i'm playing a game." 

Credits to original author, who i'm probably misquoting.
Dungeon Petz does an amazing job of marrying a crazy theme to relatively euro mechanics. I love it.
**Adrenaline** looks promising for this. It's coming for Christmas, so we'll see
Dead of Winter is high on this list for me.
**Last Night on Earth**,  I think the theme is inseparable from the mechanics. The card art is excellent as well, quality and theme.
Terraforming Mars most recently for me. 
Agricola
**Battlestar Galactica** is my answer. Things are always going wrong, there's paranoia, action, drama. It really feels like the show.
My favourite marriage of theme and mechanics is Arkham horror series 
Captain Sonar is pretty good, except for the engineer role. Still fun as hell though. 
I used these guys for a mock up. No dramas.

Also go to /r/tabletopgamedesign
Color printer + card stock + card sleeves. :)
How far are you into your design process?
artscow? Not sure if you want it in bulk but I had three decks made (for 2 copies of black vienna). It was painless, took a couple of weeks and they often have great deals.
SPOD (Superior Print on Demand) is excellent.  They are fast, good quality, and they will do large orders as well.  I had a great experience with them when I got a couple of decks made for a PnP version of **Burning Suns**.  
**Race For The Galaxy**  
My gaming group plays with the cards from the base game plus the first 2 arc 1 expansions.  We play with the base rules, no goals or takeovers.  We've played it tons of times and never get sick of it.
**Twilight Struggle**

Still learning something new each game.
*Quantum*. Always close in the end, and I just love the dice movement/strength balance
Netrunner!  
Easily over a hundred games in and I still suck. 
don't know if it qualifies but mine would be **Magic The Gathering**,   always up for a game.
Dominion. Most played.
Puerto Rico. Second most played.
Hive. I'll gladly play anytime anywhere.  I think i played 10 games of it yesterday... I'm easily above 100 plays, probably close to 200 even.  
Carcassonne.  Its relaxing. 
Tichu now and forever
**Avalon**.  I could probably play every day and not get tired of it.

Also, **Five Tribes**.  I love that game.
Monopoly Deal. It's such weird bullshit and I play all the time. 
Castles of Burgundy
Codenames!  I take it with me to every party
**Apples to Apples** (usually the Junior edition). It's a hit with everyone in the family, including my 7-year-old daughter.

**Ticket to Ride** (any version). While my dad will play any game brought to the table when he's here, he absolutely loves TtR.

**Tsuro**. Similar to A2A, but more on the "board" side of games. There's little strategy, but that little bit can make a big difference. Plus, the kids love when they have someone else's "fate" in their hands.

Typically, though, games that don't get played here get removed from the shelf.
I've played euchre over a 1,000 times in my life, and I'm still excited every time I get to play it again
Star Realms, I always wanted a deck builder but for some reason nothing stuck! I bounced right off Dominion and a few others because it was just... well... boring. I threw Star Realms Colony Wars in my backpack before college and I cant stop playing it. It stays in my bag and I bust it out at lunch or waiting for a class, just always scratched the deck building ich so fast. It also has some fast paced cuthroat moves, all the while still not making the loser feel like garbage (like mtg) because you build such a cool deck in the process. +1 from me! (Also hella cheap at 15$)
**Ticket to ride** I always want to play again. It probably helps that my dad and I are of very similar skill levels, and we've had multiple games that end with less than a 10 point gap between us. I have a couple of the expansion maps but the vanilla game is the one I am always drawn back to.
Battlestar Galactica.
**Coup** without the expansion. The base game is a riot! It lets you quickly test your friends' bluffing skills without too much of a risk because each game is only 10 to 15 mins long. We have played dozens of times and still whip it out 2 years later.

My favorite way to play is blind. I just lie about who I am and hope I have the right cards when called out. :)
**Battlestar Galactica**. But it's more like I've played >100 times. (Literally...)
**Pandemic: The Cure** & **Valeria Card Kingdoms** are the two games in my collection that have over 30 plays. 

**Pandemic: The Cure** gets a lot of play due to how quick the set up is, and how easy it is to reset the board. I mainly play this 2-player with my wife, and when we break it out it gets played multiple times in a setting. The randomness of the dice keeps the game fresh, but there is still enough player agency that we rarely blame the game for our loses. I just picked up the expansion this past week but haven't gotten a chance to play it yet, very excited. 

I'm not really sure why **Valeria** gets played so often. I can't really preach about how perfect the mechanics are, because I definitely think the game has flaws. But we play this game A LOT and I'm always excited to bust it out. I just think the game really hits a chord with my group and me. The art is fantastic, the gameplay is quick (basically just an update of **Machi Koro**) and it's very accessible. I can not wait for the expansion to be released. 
I'd play **BattleCON**, **Codenames**, and **Ghost Stories** any time despite having played each around 30 times.
**Hanabi.**  Probably have a solid 3 digits in on that one...

**Agricola.** Most plays from back when it was one of like 3-4 games we owned.  Most at 2 player, pretty much all with Farmers of the Moor.

**Tzolk'in.** Mostly 2 player, all with Tribes & Prophecies.  It's great at 3-4 also.  I can't say I really recommend it at 5.

**Dominion.**  I mean, it's a different game every time you play.  Pretty much always awesome.
**Acquire**, I've played hundreds of games and still really enjoy it.  I've written my own electronic version of it and get in a couple of games a day with friends.

I've become settled into certain strategies and there aren't a terribly large amount of interesting decisions any more, but I find the experience really cathartic.
Camel Up
**Glory to Rome**, **Innovation**, **Go**, **High Frontier**, **Keyflower**, **Brass**, **Cosmic Encounter**
Baldurs Gate 2!

Ooops wrong sub.

I don't regret my actions.
Epic. Plays like MtG but with everything in one box, and rules for draft, sealed, and constructed. I love every round I play, and it only open up depth the more I play.
Love Letter. (With house rules) 
**6nimmt** if we're restricting this to hobby games. **go** if we're not.
Scrabble. 
Can't believe none of my **war of the ring** peeps have chimed in! I have probably 50 plays of the 2nd edition, and maybe 20 more w expansions LOME and WOME. I am always up for a WOTR experience 
I'll replay anything that requires high skill or has high variety.

**Chicago Express** is one that I am always up for and have played it a ton. The coolest thing about the game is that one small auction can completely transform the game. If a person does an auction, it can disrupt teams and incentives. For instance, if you and I both own 1 share in the red company, we will both split the profits of red 50/50, making cooperation mutually beneficial. If however, another red share were to be auctioned and you win it, the split is now 1/2 meaning you get 66% of the profit while I only get 33%. At this point, it is pointless for me to help red out and not only that, I should sabotage the company so that it's value does not increase that much. You on the other hand are going to want to boost the company a ton because you have a lot to gain from it. An auction can also control the length of the game. If there is only one share left of a company, it may end the game if it is auctioned. The players that currently have the most money WANT the game to end and as such will auction it off. If you currently have less money than many players, you will want to stop an auction from happening by turning the auction dial and doing nothing (also called null action). The game plays fast and it fits 2-6 (though 2 is not advisable at all). It's amazing because it plays really quickly and the power of a single auction does so many things.

I'm also a big fan of **Magic the Gathering**. I say this because I make dozens of decks, but I don't spend more than $10 per deck because of the format I play, Block Constructed. Games are fast and I love seeing a deck's strategy fire off. If you have a ton of decks, the replay value is endless.
Arkham Horror. 

7 Wonders. 


I play a lot of different games. Not many make it to 30 plays. I know as with OP that TtR is up there. 

Other ones I can think of are

Munchkin (any version): didnt see this one mentioned here but I think this is a fantastic & humorous D&D style card game. The go-to starting game every game day for our group. 

Puerto Rico: has been mentioned often already. I want to add that the theme relates heavy on colonial past but tries (quite obviously) to be very politically correct. This is the source of many jokes in our group. 

30seconds: What can I say. The wife loves it so we all have to play it. :)
**Go**. Played it more than likely all games in my collection combined, and it's still a learning and engaging experience.
In my CCG days? **Legend of the Five Rings.** And, if someone is willing to pull out a pre-lawsuit Scorpion deck, I will happily dishonor you to death. 



Recently? **Mage Knight/Star Trek Frontiers** even though it takes 48 hours to set up/tear down, I'm always up for a solo game. Which is why I don't get any sleep/have any friends. 
**Star Wars: Destiny** looks like it'll get there shortly. Playing it once-to-twice a day since the pre-release. 
Chsss
**Roll for the Galaxy**! I lost the last match, so I'm looking forward to reclaiming the win from my fiancee. Also **Betrayal** because I haven't gotten much chance to dig into the expansion content.
You'll think I'm crazy, but there's this game called Wizard's Quest. I got it for like, $4 at an auction and it might be the most played game on my shelf (I own nearly 100 games most of which cost around 20-80) if you ever get a hold of this game, it is so good. Play it. Do anything you can to get it 
**No Thanks!**

I know I mention this game in almost every recommendation thread.
7 Wonders. Play it all the time,and can never get enough of it. 

I can also always go for a quick game of love letter. 
**A Feast For Odin** got up there real quick.
I don't think I'll ever stop looking forward to One Night Ultimate Werewolf or Escape.
**Dominion** - more than 14k games online and I still look forward to the next one.  I guess it's an addiction.   I think it's the best quick 2-player game.
Agricola, Puerto Rico, 7 Wonders, Dominion
Quite a few. I'm pretty sure the only game in my top 20 that I haven't played 30+ times is **Tragedy Looper**. Some of these are a handful of meatspace plays, over 30 mostly from playing online. A few games that never get old for me, with experienced opponents:

- Summoner Wars
- Trains
- Lords of Waterdeep
- Castles of Burgundy
- Ticket to Ride
- Small World
- 7 Wonders
- Race for the Galaxy
- Innovation
- Hanabi
- Star Realms
- Dominion
- Resistance: Avalon
- Mottainai
- Catan (Only with people who play it *fast*, usually online, and I hate the expansions.)
- Stratego
- Scythe (May have *just* broken 30 games, with friends who own the awesome Kickstarter version and have probably already played around 100.)
In rough order:

Glory to Rome  (100+ plays and still loving it)  
Mottainai  
Power Grid  
Race for the Galaxy  
Hansa Teutonica  


Tokaido, 7 Wonders, Can't Stop
Ascension, it's just me favorite deck building game and I can't get enough. Even got my gf and while family to play so it's all the better since they don't usually go for anything more then uno.  
Cosmic Encounter. Haven't had a bad game yet. It's almost always my go to for first time gamers. 
Glory to Rome 
**Merchants and Marauders** and **War of the Ring** for me 
**Castles of Mad King Ludwig** is an excellent building game. Its deceptively simple tile bidding process gives this game a TON of depth. The process of building your castle is also just really enjoyable.

As a bonus, you can feel free to make up stories rationalizing why the greenhouse is attached to the laundry room, or why Ludwig has had you design a castle comprised solely of bedrooms.

I wouldn't overly recommend the expansion. I found the various additions pigeonholed everyone into a particular strategy, and unnecessarily cluttered an already great game.
**Cosmic encounter**. I'll play anytime. 
Eldritch Horror. We just beat the last of the original Ancient Ones yesterday (Azathoth) which was the criteria I set for myself for buying expansions. Now I'll have even more reasons to play.

Some day I'm going to play another game I own. Some day.
**Cosmic Encounter.** The variety in aliens (and then the variety in the mix of aliens) is enough to make the game worth playing over and over and it also happens to be great fun. The cosmic deck means no one feels personally attacked (to an extent) and there's no shortage of ridiculous moments to make each game feel more enjoyable than the last. If I had to keep only one game it'd be cosmic
Hands down **Secret Hitler**
Probably the only games I've played that much, period, are Codenames and Secret Hitler. Indeed, I am happy to play those any time! 
I have well over thirty games of **A Game of Thrones** logged on Thronemaster. And yeah, lots of Catan, especially **Cities and Knights**
Santorini: and its not even with the expansion god still!
Imperial.
Pandemic. It was the game that really got 2 friends and me into playing board games 4 or 5 years ago and it's still probably our favorite. We like the cooperative aspect of it, talking out strategies and such, and with the different expansions and versions, it changes it up enough to where we amazingly aren't sick of it yet. We're one month away from the end of Pandemic Legacy Season 1 and already looking forward to Season 2.
Check the flair!
Railways of the world
TAK
Santorini

Warhammer 40k: Conquest. I'm super disappointed that it's dead now. 

BattleCon is a fantastic game! There are a ridiculous number of characters available, and matchups require very different strategies depending on who you're fighting against. 
**Kingdom Builder**

**Carcassonne**
**CITADELS** - Simple, fast, we always play it in 6 when we want something with less clutter :)
Cosmic Encounter. I've only played as less than half the aliens!
Galaxy Trucker and Dominion. So much replayability!
#Twilight Struggle  
  
I've played 1,000+ games over the years... my wife and I have a perpetual cardboard Cold War set up at one end of our gaming table.  We get in at least a few Turns a night (if not a whole game if her MadDash Ruskie ways win the day :/) while discussing events of our days.  Good times.  
  
And I can't wait for tonight's session!
**Heroscape** Never really gets old. We're down to playing only once a month, but that's because we play different games during other weeks. 
*Settlers of Catan* 

We switch it up all the time with different house rules. Makes it fun and challenging! 
**7 Wonders** is easily my most played game (100+) games and I still love playing it. This includes with Cities and Leaders. Even to this day, I still like trying out different victory paths and to figure out strats for specific wonders (looking at you Stonehenge).  

I also love to play **Concordia** and **Orleans** any opportunity I get.
red dragon inn (not so much with just 1 of the core versions but with multiple core versions and the allies (giving a current total of 31 characters) there is a lot of replay-ability)
Carcassonne is my favorite game. I love playing it I just wish I had more friends to play it with because I find it far more enjoyable with 3-4 players and most of the time I only have 2. That  said I always suggest it and enjoy it every time and am more than willing to have a few more rounds.
Captain Sonar. Never get sick of it!
Terra Mystica. It is by far my favorite board game I've ever played and I don't ever want to stop playing it.
Bang! The Dice Game. We play it almost every weekend we have game night. It's super easy to learn, has hidden roles (but without the stress of boldfaced lying like UW or Resistance), accommodates up to 8 players, and plays fast. 

Runner-up would be Deception: Murder in Hong Kong.    
*Kingdom Death Monster*

I can't get enough of the game. I got it this summer along with scythe and have barely touched the latter as well as the rest of my collection.
The resistance
NEFARIOUS. NEFARIOUS. NEFARIOUS. My wife and I have played the shit out of this game, both by ourselves and with friends.  It's different every time and super easy to learn.  Tons and tons of replayability.

And I second Carcassonne.
**Dixit**
Karuba 
**Citadels**, **Caverna**, **Love Letter**, **Black Fleet**, **7 Wonders Duel**, **Samurai Sword**\*

I asterisked Samurai Sword because I've not played it 30 times but I've played **Bang!** well over a hundred times and it basically is the same game and replaced Bang. But the core gameplay is identical and I like it.
X-wing. Started this summer and am at 33 plays with more to come
Splendor
Castles of burgundy, x-wing

Onuw :)
Splendour. Played it hundred of times and it still plays great. 

It's pretty much the national sport of my house at this point. 
- 6 nimmt 
- 7 Wonders (need Leader and/or Cities expansion)
- Battle Line (but for 2 only)
- Codenames
- Coup (haven't tried the expansion yet, but it certainly will help the replayability)
- King of Tokyo (only with the right group)
- Race for the Galaxy (need expansions)
- Ticket to Ride (need different maps)

Mostly lower weight games because they are easier to put to table with my several group of friends. I suspect my higher weight games incl. Five Tribes and Suburbia should make the list too, but I have yet played them 30 times.
Going through my BGG account made me realize that I have a lot! Expansions definitely help for some of them. Hell, I've played Legendary and Neuroshima Hex! well over 100 times, but there's so many ways to play that they never seem stale.

* **Catan**
* **Codenames**
* **Coloretto**
* **Coup**
* **Dead Drop**
* **The Duke**
* **Eminent Domain**
* **Hive**
* **Marvel: Legendary**
* **Lords of Waterdeep**
* **Love Letter**
* **Neuroshima Hex!**
* **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**
* **Pandemic**
* **Power Grid**
* **Yinsh**
Concordia.. always new ways to start and finish that game.
Ghost Stories
Sentinels of the multiverse
I haven't quite played it 30 times yet (22 actually), but **Combat Commander: Europe** is that game to me.  Even at around 2 to 3 hours per game, all that finishing a game does is makes me want to go back and play it again.  If it wasn't such a time commitment for only two people, I'd probably play it more.
**The Others**

This game is amazing, really thematic, tense, and exciting

I haven't played **War of the Ring** nearly as many times, but i can definitely see myself playing this 30+ times. I've also played **Onitama** 30+ times, but I wouldn't say I "look forward to the next round" but I'll always be down to play, and I do find myself *wanting* to play when in the right mood
Smash Up, Cosmic Encounter, and Bang.
Netrunner and Seasons.

Seasons a bit less simply because there's nothing new on the horizon, though we definitely still pull it out regularly.

Netrunner we've played in to the ground, but it's still fun, *and* we don't even have everything available yet :p
Not that I necessarily think it's for everyone, but without a doubt the game that I've played the most is **Sentinels of the Multiverse**.  It really wound up being the bridge between my casual and hardcore gamer friends.  I'm almost positive I've played it close to a hundred times (well over that if we're counting app plays), and it remains a favorite of my groups, myself, and hits the table regularly.
River Dragons, Colt Express, HeroQuest, xwing 
These games for me are:  
Scythe  
Raiders of the North Sea  
Codenames  
Agricola  

Talisman. It was the first "modern" boardgame to make it big in Poland after we overcame communism, known as "Magia i Mieczu (magic and sword). 2nd edition with polish text. Even got a Poland only expansion called the cave.
I probably would play over 30 times any game I own! But my SO is my gaming partner and not always she's up to it due to having a tiresome job and we also have a 13 month old boy soooooooo not related to the games itself but to the partner
Munchkin! i know many people didn't like this. but me and my boys really like to back stab the hell out of each other and argue
Lord of the rings - LCG. Easily over 200 plays.

Timeline - a lot. It's so simple and easy it works every time

Loveletter - same as Timeline, over 500 plays
30 times is a lot. But i managed to break that limit with a few games.  
**Catan**, **Catan the Card Game**, **Carcassone** and **Star Realms**  
If you ask me to play any of these games i will gladly do it.
I will not count trading card/dice games here.  

**Terra Mystica**, **Android:Netrunner**... I could play these games forever.
X-wing, and Avalon.  
I've probably played Betrayal 40+ times at this  point. It's not a very short game (though that depends on the haunt), but each game feels different and we always bring out a new haunt and with the expansion just being released, there are opportunities for even more games. The  haunts usually feel very unique, although some are hit and miss. I've generally enjoyed the new haunts from WW and feel they bring a lot of new and interesting mechanics to the endgame.

If you have a dedicated group of people to play with, it is a blast to play on a dark, cold evening with the lighting set appropriately. 
Cosmic Encounter!

With the sheer amount of aliens available with all the expansions, each time I play, it's effectively a new game
Betrayal at the house on the Hill!  

Edit :
And pathfinder 
Monopoly & Monopoly Deal. I could happily play either for an entire day.
Cosmic Encounter - It's almost always a completely novel experience.

The Resistance (and Secret Hitler), Coup - Always fun, and, at the very worst, if someone fucks up the game and things go south, it never more than 15 minutes until you can start again.

Battlestar Galactica - Great game, but I don't get to play it anymore, since my current group didn't get into it.

Survive: Escape from Atlantis - For impressing upon everyone that life isn't fair. 
Coup.  The rose king.  Hive.  Cosmic encounter.  

I have many that are claiming that list slowly (forbidden stars and Lords o waterdeep have about 10 or 15 plays so far)  
Tsuro

Small World (w/underworld)

Carcassonne: Gold rush

Catan: cities and knights

7 wonders (w/leaders)

Bang: the dice game

The resistance (take breaks)

I've got plenty more but I'll bust those out with almost any group and I never really get tired of any of them (I do try to get plays of the new hotness when I can)
I've played the Discworld board game more than 100 times and still love it. The varied characters and goals offer unique gameplay experiences on each playthrough. Probably my favourite game, that or Lord of the Rings Risk.
Still a few plays short of 30, but **The Voyages of Marco Polo** for sure. The variable board setup and variable character roles make each game really unique. It's a different challenge every time you play. 
Dungeons and Dragons.... not really a boardgame, but it's where boardgames led me!
While its not really a board game one of my favorite all time games is munchkin. 
Battlecon and Yomi. Probably played a hundred games of Yomi and a thousand of Battlecon, and neither ever gets old.
Talking about actively looking forward to it (i.e. I may suggest these): **Hanabi**, **Age of Steam**, **The Great Zimbabwe**, **Power Grid**, and **Peloponnes**.
**Flux** and a Chinese variant of Bang called **San Guo Sha/ Legend of the Three Kingdoms**.  The Rules are basically the same as in the game Bang, except there are many more characters to choose from and they are themed around the three kingdoms era in China.  I would recommend trying that game out if your group is willing to use an app to check translations of the cards into english or just try the [Base game in english](https://smile.amazon.com/San-Guo-Sha-Card-Game/dp/B00971HRHC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480335203&sr=8-1&keywords=san+guo+sha+english)
Actual boardgames? none I believe so far, but 7 wonders might be getting close to that number (I blame one mofo that gets 5 new games every week)

But online I've have over 100 Terra Mystica games and about the same number of Through the Ages aNSoC, both I would gladly play either online or not (though I must say, after playing the TtA this saturday, I might believe it is better off online, the military can be a pain to get it right sometimes, especially when it can come from 9 different types of sources)
Tiny epic galaxies
Betrayal at House on the Hill - I know some people give this game some grieve but I have definitely played this game more then 30 times with my game group and it is still always on the list to play when we get together. It is always a different game, even if we get a repeat of the haunt, especially with the expansion. I even find it as a gateway game for those that are not into the hobby. 
**Descent!** Just finished the app campaign last night, and I'm itching to get back into the overlord seat after the holidays. I've played (including 1st edition) at least 10 full campaigns, plus lots of other one-shot games.
Agricola, codenames, hive, sushi dice, five tribes.
Agricola and Battlestar Galatica. 
**lifeboats**! Simply magestic the way u can unfriend people just by playing a boardgame. Loads of fun every time.
A lot of games in my collection fit this. That's why they're still in my collection after all. However, the ones that spring to mind as *"Must play this gain. Now!"* are:

**Twilight Imperium 3** is a game that I play at least four times a year. It basically slurps up a whole weekend, but it's worth it. I can never wait till the next time we play it. 

**7 Wonders: Duel** sees a lot of plays. The recent expansion definitely invigorated my enjoyment for the game. 

**Neuroshima Hex!** on the tablet. It's fast, easy and the app does most of the work for you. I have the physical game, but that rarely sees play. The app is just so complete. This is probably my most-played game ever. 
Shadows of brimstone, Bang, and Betrayal
Marvel Legendary. All my friends arent as hardcore about gaming as i am and they all love the theme and gameplay. I have most of the expansions and seeing all all my friends get super into it just makes me want to play more and more. 
For my group:

**BSG**

**Eclipse**

**Stone Age**

**Room 25**
Dominion
Formula D
Hanabi.
That trust and communication man.
Castles of Burgundy. 
My two "go to" games which have well over 30 plays each and I always enjoy playing again are Innovation and Glory to Rome, Black Box edition. 
Just enough strategy and decision making to be engaging and just chaotic enough to be entertaining every time we play. 

Short story, we were playing team innovation over the weekend. My team was well behind.  We had more achievements but the other team had a ton of points and a great machine going and winning on achievements in team Innovation is rare. 
I had the chance to get fission on the board and dogma it. 
I had clocks over both of the other players. They both had to draw a 10 and if it was red we would wipe all boards, score piles and hands.  
It was great.  Completely chaotic and our best option at the time to have any chance to win. 
If the game ends due to drawing out the 10 pile it's high score to win, but achievements are the tie breaker.  Our hope was to draw out the last few cards and win on a 3-2 achievement tie breaker. 
Unfortunately, the other team managed a few points more than we could before the deck was drawn out. 
Absolutely exciting all the way down. 
Good choice on 7 Wonders! We burned out after about 100 games, but easily made it way past 30.

Dominion is also good, but kinda cheats because it has so many expansions. Same with Pandemic- I doubt we'd still be playing if we only had the base set.
if you can get enough people werewolf is always a great game! especially if you get the deluxe edition and give most people files that just mess with the peopld. my favorite combination is the drunk ( who can't talk) and the spellcaster ( who makes people not talk for one round).
Star Realms is the most played game at home. We cannot get enough
**Secret Hitler** never gets old, we are just too damn good at lying to eachother and LOVE IT.

Same reason why **Battlestar Galactica** remains a favourite.
**Agricola**, **Race For The Galaxy**, **Dominion**, **Carcassonne**, and **The Castles Of Burgundy**. 

All fantastic classics. 
I've played nearly 800 games, and the list of games I have played 30+ times and still want to play is short!

**A Feast for Odin** - 50 plays
**Agricola** - 90 plays
**Magic** - 200 plays
**Bohnanza** - 70 plays
**Race for the Galaxy** - 60 plays
 

Played 30 times and do **not** want to play again:

- **Dominion** 60 plays

7 Wonders for us. Probably 50 times. It's the only game where the expansions are great and don't feel overwhelming for us.

We just picked up Dominion and I feel like it could turn into the same. 

Blood Rage isn't to that point yet, but we've played it 4 times this weekend. 
Coup.  I am a sucker for bluffing games, it's fast and wicked fun 
Betrayal at the house on the hill. It has a modular board that you lay out as you explore new rooms and you play a different scenario each time based on what triggers the haunt. There are like 50 haunts in the base game. Plus you could just pick a haunt if you end up with one you've already played. 
For me: Agricola, Puerto Rico, War of the Ring, Samurai Swords.
Innovation base game + Echoes.  My girlfriend's favorite game and I'm always eager to play it.
Splendor is one of my favorites. My SO and our friend group can play it for hours. Great blend of strategy and luck of the draw.
For me it's been both:

Concordia - Variability on setup, easy to teach, deep game with strategic choices, I love it!

Marco Polo - Same reasoning but a bit quicker. 
Pandemic. Both the original with add ons and Legacy. I just love the mechanics and the drama as well as the layers of our own game culture we've created around it like shaking hands and congratulating everyone in a slightly formal manner every time we cure a disease. It also tends to leave everyone happy as it's a team game.
I've played base **Blood Rage** about thirty times, the base game with no expansions, and I'm dying to play it right now! I just signed up for Adepticon in March, and both Blood Rage tournaments taking place there. Woo hoo!
Rummikub

Nothing more sayisfying than finding that perfect setup to clear your entire rack.
My core group of board gamers tends to warm up with the resistance every single time, and it seems they never get tired of it. I still enjoy it. 
**Cosmic Encounter** and **Sentinels of the Multiverse** are the only "meaty" games that I know I've played more than 30 times, and I will happily play each of them any time the opportunity arises. Cosmic Encounter is my favorite game.
**Hanabi**, **7 Wonders/ and duel**, **Love Letter**, **Munchkin**, **The Game**, **Patchwork**, **Wizard**
Not quite 30 but for us.  
  
**Kingdomino**
Red Dragon Inn. 

Because it's easy to introduce to new friends, and my husband and I can get everybody laughing at the absurdity. No matter what we're in the mood for, game nights usually start or end with a bit of Red Dragon.
**Race for the Galaxy**

**Ghost Stories**

**Memoir 44**
Descent 2nd edition

Star Realms

King of Tokyo
Smash Up and Castle of Mad king Ludwig are two games i think are perfect no matter my mood
**Race for the Galaxy**

**One Night Ultimate Werewolf**

**Spyfall**

**Two Rooms and a Boom**

**Escape: the Curse of the Temple**

**Codenames**

**Dutch Blitz** - It has become the fan favorite amongst several different groups of friends. 
[euronimoes](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/90272/euronimoes)

I don't see anyone who said Splendor yet. The game mechanics are simple, but so much fun. I have yet to get sick of that game. I never say no to playing it.

I saw ticket to ride mentioned and I second that one too. 
I've played most of the games in my collection more than 30 times and I still enjoy them.  However, some have been played hundreds of times and don't quite engage me like they used to, even though I like them.  The ones that currently fit this criteria are:

**Rage**--awesome trick-taking game for a random number of players

**Star Realms**--played to death, but still fun

**Galaxy Trucker**--can't imagine this one getting old, especially with expansions; however, I need to find more people that love it like I do

**Machi Koro**--sometimes the dice hate me, but it's still a fun, light game

**India Rails**--longer time commitment, but still a fun, relaxing game experience (also **Empire Builder**)

**Nightfall**--again, I just need to find people to play with

Edit: **Smallworld**--forgot about this one until someone else mentioned it.  Always fun and a little crazy.

Edit: **St Petersburg**--it just doesn't get old.  Excellent, tight mechanics and fun strategy.

I have other games I enjoy playing, but these are ones I look forward to with a little more interest.
Boss Monster, when I'm able to get people together to play its always a good time. The strategy involved is fun and its a fairly simple game to pick up. Using all the expansions is also very fun.
SET is one of my all-time favorites.

This one is going to sound mega-nuts, but for the heavier ones Food Chain Magnate. My boyfriend and I have been living together for six months. We've played it about 30 or so times just between the two of us while lazily going about a Saturday, not counting the number of times we've dragged in other folks at board game events or parties.
**Through the Ages** never seems to get old even after roughly 150 plays.
Sentinels of the Multiverse

I lost track of how many times I've played it, but it's probably in the 300s at the very least, and I'm always up for a game of it. 
**7 Wonders** is always a treat for me.

I love playing **Catan** for the upteenth time because I've gone beyond your typical min-maxing math strategies and I'm really enjoying exploring the psychological aspect of it and some bizarre endgame plays (4 and 5 pt jumps).

**Tokaido** is so goddamn relaxing and positive that I don't care if I lose.

There's a game my friends introduced me to called **Traverse** that blows Chess out of the water.  It has the classic "easy to learn hard to master" aspect.  You start with a circle, square, triangle, diamond.  Each piece can move according to its sides.  You can jump other pieces the same length of distance to the other side.  Circles get returned if jumped.  Setup is variable, unlike Chess.  If it catches on the Reddit community would love it.  Plays 2 or 4 really well.  
advanced squad leader
Definitely 7Wonders. I don't think I've played other games more than 30 times (it's so hard to find time to play :'( )
Star Realms.

Although admittedly 30 rounds is just one sitting if you're really into it.
Cosmic Encounter. We play almost every time we get together and never get sick of it.
Blood Rage, Mansions of Madness 2nd ed, Lords of Waterdeep fall in that category for me right now
Web of Spies!

I brought it to club in fall of 2015, and with a couple exceptions, it's been played almost every week since. 
**Sentinels of the Multiverse** - This game hers my attention every time I play, and with so many characters and ways to play, it's new every time.

**Dead of Winter** - I love this game. Possible traitor mechanics. Selfish co-op, if played correctly. Good game.
**Combat Commander**
BattleCON and Sentinels of the Multiverse, for me.

BattleCON is a deep fighting game that is easy for new people to pick up.  I've gotten several people in my class hooked on it.  They're Smash Bros. players, but they can recognise how involved the game can get with its back and forth.

SotM on the other hand has a lot of variation with its *sheer number of decks*, so much that another few hundred playthroughs might not see me getting every variation played.  Games can be a bit long, but it's a heroic fight and a bit of a puzzle each time.
**Battlestar Galactica Vanilla**

I must have introduced this game to about 40 people.

Im about to get my first expansion (Pegasus) after playing for five years. Looking forward to it.
**Kingdom Death**  

My wife and I have played it for 28 sessions now, and we aren't even halfway through all the content with the expansions.  
Crokinole
- Star Wars DVD Trivial Pursuit

Hahaha none of you will ever beat me! NO ONE CAN BEAT ME!
I'm probably (definitely) in the minority here, but XCOM: TBG. I will never not love this game.
Patchwork. That game is like crack for me. I am hopelessly addicted and I never get sick of it. Also, Eldritch Horror gets a ton of play at my house and I can't say I am sick of it yet.
Twilight Imperium. I've played far more than 30 times and it's still my favorite game. 
One of the guys in my group and I have been playing **Star Wars: Armada** 2-3 times a month for about a year now. We simply can't get enough of it. It's in a weird niche for us and not necessarily something I'd consider a "le classic gem" but we just can't seem to get enough of the damn thing. The upcoming campaign box will probably put us in pure fanboy mode. We still learn new tactics and strategies every time we play and are just as enthusiastic about it now as we were our first couple sessions.
Not really board games but we love Bananagrams and Farkl.  They're a lot of fun and not expensive at all.  
Twilight Struggle I have played the boardgame dozens of times and the computer game I have played countless times. I am always excited to play that game.

Also the Gallerist.
Catan most definitely. Friendships and relationships are usually ended before the game begins. It's an all out war that only gets more and more competitive. 
Magic the Gathering, especially cube drafting. We've done it once a month or so for years, always fun.

Mage Knight (solo): My go-to game when I want to have a quiet night in. I'm familiar enough with the game that the decisions aren't overwhelming, but still interesting. Planning out a day or night helps clear my head. It's almost cathartic.

Descent 2nd edition: Not sure if this counts, I've played through the campaign on both sides a few times. Played about 30 scenarios. Might be getting into RTL soon.
Descent (Journeys in the Dark + Expansions) will always do it for me.  There are enough ways to specialize the hero combinations to keep it fresh.

We play with a shot clock to keep the game progressing at an enjoyable speed
**Escape: The Curse of the Temple**. I've played up to 9 games in a solo sitting easily, so hitting 30 was not a problem. I haven't even tried many of the mini-expansions I have, but I really want to.

**One Night Ultimate Werewolf** along with the **Daybreak** and **Vampire** expand-alones.
For me it is San Guo Sha, chinese card game. It is (could say was copied) very similar to Bang. The thing is this game is more complex, has tons of strategy. It is literally very fun to play. Me and my friends started to play this 3-4 years ago and we still want to play it when we can meet each other again. I would say that I really recommend this game. You can find eng translation online. This game always update but it is Chinese... I really hope that there will be someone tries to continue translating this game again in the future...
Betrayal at the House on the Hill, seriously I've played around 30 scenarios of this game so far and it's always the first game my group goes for
CV!!!!!!!!

Forbidden Stars

Kingdom Death: Monster 
Well I am currently playing 18 games of terra mystica online. 
Betrayal at the House on the Hill. With the expansion it has 101 different stories to play out. 

Small World. Class and ability randomization help mix things up. 

Marvel Legendary. Different heroes, villains and scenarios each time. 
None, as I don't think I've played any game 30+ times.
**Cosmic Encounter**  
  
After sitting on CE and the first expansion for more than a year now, I was ready to give up hope on the other expansions ever being translated to german.  
Well guess what, the german publisher just translated three additional expansions, so I will have SO MANY ALIENS to play with.  
Can't wait!
**Catan**. I've had so many come-from-behind victories I never feel out of the game, and downtime isn't bad.

**Cosmic Encounter**.  I haven't played this 30 times yet, but yeah it isn't gonna wear out.
Monopoly.
Sweet!  I've been hoping they would officially announce their **One Night Ultimate: Beating a Dead Horse**.
Bezier has found a money maker in ONUW and it shows, with all their subsequent releases under that brand name. Honestly though, I wish they would stop it now. Bezier had my attention with Suburbia and Mad King Ludwig, and ONUW was a great party game. They need to continue on the trend of clever original games, and fewer derivatives. 

Those are 2 of my favourite party/casual games. I want to be very excited, but I can't help but be nervous...
Ted Alspach seems to possess a rare talent among game designers where he gets worse as he creates more games.

ONUW and Daybreak are fantastic games.  Everything else after that?  Duds.
Sounds like it will be similar to Murder: deception in hong kong
Howl 2.
[This Geeklist](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/190784/one-night-ultimate-everygame) needs One Spy Ultimate Codenames adding
Hmm, Spies and Werewolf. If only there was a game there. Perhaps with a bomb. And a number of rooms greater than one.
Ted, stop. Just design an original game.
Wow, that would be two games I hate wrapped into one box of complete suck. I get these are super popular but so far th only party game I have ever played that I liked was Telestrations.
I actually like fantasy flight rule books. But who knows maybe i'm crazy. If you want an awful rule book just buy any kick-starter game.
I've never had a problem with their rule books, but then I've never played some of the older games that are supposed to be the worst offenders.

Eldritch Horror makes a game with a lot going on really easy to learn. Arkham LCG has some slightly weird wording on some cards, but it all made sense with a read of the rules.

For reference, 'uses four ammo' means you put four resource tokens on the card to represent ammo, then spend one each time you use the card action to fire it.
Have you played other FFG games? Their learn to play and rules reference system works well for me, but I'm used to cross referencing.
FFG rulebooks have used a very specific style of writing over recent years, especially once shifting to the learn to play / rules reference format. It's weird the first time around, but each time you learn an FFG game, you'll find it easier to learn the next game... and the next game... and so on. By now, I actually love their rulebooks and find them quite clear. 

The tricky part is keeping the terminology straight between their games. As a Netrunner player, I constantly find myself referring to my Arkham Horror LCG actions as "clicks" and then I use those "clicks" to "install" my assets. :/
The Arkham Horror LCG rulebook needs a revision or two to increase the clarity of the rules.

But overall, I really absolutely prefer the "Rules Reference" style. Once we get a round or two in of a game, it's so much easier to go to the exact section in the Rules Reference instead of trying to hunt down that one line you remember from that one rule somewhere in the big rulebook. Had that problem the last time we played Battlestar Galactica in fact.

Of note is that Mechs vs Minions has a very good implementation of the "Learn to Play" and "Rules Reference" split. The Rules Reference is literally a copy/paste of how you encounter the rule originally via the L2P or Mission book.
Fantasy Flight having bad rulebooks and nonexistent box inserts are like the two things constant in the hobby. Even their simpler games often have confusing layouts that make them more difficult than they need to be. 

For a few of their recent games they've put out video tutorials that are a mile better than their rulebooks but most of their games you just have to deal with it.
I don't mind their rulebooks. The worst FFG rulebook is a million times better than the rulebook for 1st edition Robinson Crusoe.
FFG is known for putting important rules in side bars and captions. If you are having trouble finding something, chances are it's in an insert and looks like a picture caption or example.
Bit of a harsh one, but a lot of the players you find in public boardgamey places are, well ... weird.

When a new game store opened nearby, I started visiting weekly to play Netrunner, Star Realms or whatever else was on the table at that time. Within a month it became clear to me that I'd classify *at least* half of the players as socially inept, another 25% as pretty awkward and then there were the 10% guys who didn't seem to do anything *except* play their game of choice. You know the type: only plays one game, doesn't talk about anything else, ungroomed, can recite any given errata from the past 5 years from memory, doesn't know your name despite seeing you every week.

The remaining 15% were cool I guess. Unfortunately they were also the ones that stopped showing up fairly quickly, presumably for the same reasons. Store's closed now.

I'm all for playing games, and I'm all for being inclusive. But when we can't have a normal non-MTG related conversation for more than a minute, we're not going to get along.
Sometimes I don't want to be inclusive. Sometimes I want to play something long and complex. That means I don't *always* want you, your friend or your SO to join, not if their limit of complexity is Carcasonne.

Edit: in broader terms I'm for bringing in more people into the hobby and all that. Often I'll happily, and even suggest, a lighter game. But there is also an itch play a game that exhausts my mental capacity to the fullest.


I love stupid silly games with simple rules just as much as I love heavy games. I like playing games with family and kids. Sometimes something easy like 5 Second Rule, Guesstures, or Smart Ass is as good as games with more depth. 
Why do people like the art of Klemens Franz? It's lumpy and ugly and it's kind of a big turn off that prevents me from getting and playing games I'd otherwise think I like.
I prefer reading board games reviews than watching a video review.


You can make millennium blades someone's gateway game.

Peloponnes box art is completely fine.

Codenames and pandemic legacy shouldnt take these many awards.
I strongly dislike pandemic.
Long before I knew of the internet boardgame culture I played it with an obsessed friend, and though it was "co-op" I felt like he was just playing my turn for me by telling me the optional move.

I later learned the term "alpha-gamer" and figured this was why I had such a lukewarm response. Another friend picked up a copy so I decided to play with her and her crew. There was no single person dictating the best moves for me to make, this time there was a chorus.

So I tried it one last time thinking "I need a group where people don't all push each other into moves and we all discuss a developing strategy" this time it was always ME making suggestions and directing people..... It just never felt like working together, it felt like "take and give orders: the game"

Then later in life I discovered board game geek and I was honestly astounded by the worship pandemic receives.

Which puts me in the unpopular opinion bracket. Though, I respect those that enjoy it. I'll never take up the "stop liking things I don't like" mentality.

-Strive lest our company be lazy, cowardly manure-
I think there are a lot of people who are into board games that take it WAY too seriously and make it less fun for other players. 

I play to have fun, not to win, and I enjoy playing games of all levels/weights. However, I find myself only playing lighter weight games more often than not because the people I like to play games with only like lighter fare (and probably for the same reasons I do: most people who play heavier games are insufferable). I've tried to find like-minded heavier players who aren't INSANELY competitive and prone to RIDICULOUS AP whilst playing heavier games. It's not fun for me to sit for 3 minutes while you analyze every possible move on the board before making your turn, and then once you've made your move you say "oh wait, I just realized something better" and want to take your whole turn back. I make mistakes and sub optimal moves all the time when I'm playing, but when I notice them I just note it for the next time I play and live with my choice. 

I just want to enjoy the company of my friends and play fun looking board games. I don't want to spend 3 hours getting my ass thoroughly destroyed and spending most of that time waiting for the other player to pick out their moves each turn. 
All metal coins and poker chips add to a game is people annoyingly tapping them together or against the table constantly. 
I don't think SmashUp is that good or even that fun. 

It really feels complete random to me and some factions are much more powerfull than others and some combinations outright unbeatable (Robots + Zombies = guaranteed win)
Theme doesn't matter at all. Give me a boring euro with a new twist on mechanics. And some wooden cubes instead of minis. 
I think collecting board games and not playing them is just fine. 
Quarterbacking is fine. I'm not going to play a game about working together then sit there while you actively lose the game with a sub-optimal moves. 

That being said, I think there are tactful ways to approach suggesting a better move that can satisfy both sides of this argument. And if you're willing to give out suggestions you damn well better be willing to take them too.
I hate Meeples. 

We're trying to convince the world that board games aren't just for children and we are trying to shed the image of it being an immature pursuit, and here we have a fucking goofily-named Duplo block as our mascot. 
I wouldn't mind playing **Monopoly**.


I just don't get the appeal of legacy game.
I think I have several opinions which this subreddit would deem "unpopular". Let us begin.

1. I like **Cards against Humanity**. I don't think it's the best game (or even party game) ever made, but I like it for what it is. It is a silly and very simple joke generator. And, no, you don't have to be foul-mouthed in order to be funny. You can joke about politics, society, philosophy, religion and a lot of other "serious" things in that game and still win. It all depends on the people you're playing. Not that you should be playing it to win. You should be playing it simply to have fun and laugh.

2. I don't mind if people bend their cards. Sure, I would be happier if they didn't do that, but I'm not going to silently fume over it.

3. I hate the term "gateway game" since it implies that players eventually always surpass these games for more complex and strategic ones. Yes, they're good for introducing people to the hobby (although you could introduce people with heavier games is they're interested enough).

4. I don't like some of the trends which I'm seeing in this hobby. Namely, that people are overhyping certain games to the point that they'll do anything they can to rationalize their opinion, even if deep down inside they don't like it. Also, too many games inflate their price completely unnecessarily by including miniatures and other gimmicks like limited replayability (a.k.a. legacy elements and games like T.I.M.E. Stories) just so they can force boardgamers to buy more of their expansions.

5. I don't really care for **7 Wonders**. I think it's a poorly executed attempt at a civilization game whose main selling point is that it goes up to 7 players.
This hobby is full of hoarders and consumerist junkies. "How many games do I own in shrink? Pshh, let's buy more!!"  You don't need to buy every expansion to a game you don't play so it feels "complete".  Is your hobby playing games or buying games?  Most of us already have enough games to happily play for the rest of our lives.  And you don't need to back 20 games a year on Kickstarter.. you're giving an interest free loan for a year to a company like Queen, Eagle Gryphon or TMG that treats Kickstarter like a pre-order system for all their games.  Those exclusives don't even mix well with the game half the time!
Victory points as a win condition is a huge design wart.

This is mostly about games that require 20+ points - so **Netrunner**, **Splendor**, **Settlers of Catan** are all fine.

Usually scoring games are just drunken stumble. Players have no clear goal, so they do a bit of everything in the game and feels sandboxy and aimless. It's very difficult to judge where you are compared to others (so you don't know whether to make risky moves to catch up, or slow down and consolidate what you already have).

The only way to play these games is to do it multiple times within a short period of time, so that everyone has a chance to develop knowledge about what's worth doing and what's not. Which never works for me. I want to play different games all the time. We play with many different groups and playing a game 10 times in a row is just not an option.

Bottom line - if the goal of the game can't be translated into something tractable, or at least reduced to low numbers - I think it's just lazy design.
**Marvel Legendary** is vastly overrated, both in comparison to other board games, and even the **Legendary Encounters** games.  The set-up and take down is a pain in the ass, the card combo system is needlessly clunky, the competetive buying pool structure for a cooperative game is an unrelengtingly stupid idea, and the theme is tacked on.  Even most reviewers seems to say something to the effect of, "While I think the other Legendary games are, in fact, better *games*, I just like this one better because it's Marvel themed."  The fact that this game often gets compared to, and rated higher than, **Sentinels of the Multiverse** is outright criminal.
I hate Shut up and Sit Down. They seem more invested in trying to convince us they're really clever than reviewing games. They aren't funny and the skits are ludicrous.
* Logging game plays is the weirdest, most obsessive activity I can imagine.

* COMC posts are a weird act of ego-stroking

* Fretting over WSIG is foolish: buy what you want, not what strangers on the internet want you to buy
Codenames is massively overrated and didn't deserve a Spiel win.
Man... hard to stay upbeat and positive while replying to this kind of post, but I'll do my best.

First, either I'm way off base, or I think that the vast majority of people here are just a very different kind of gamer than me. I don't have a regular crew, I spend 90% of my 'gaming' time with family or close friends, none of whom are 'gamers', and getting anything heavier than a gateway to the table seems less likely than just about anything I can imagine.

That being said... I think I **prefer** gateway games. I'm not a competitive person. I don't enjoy 'investing' my entire evening (or weekend) into a single game. I don't enjoy AP-inducing decisions that end up feeling like work.  **I don't get any satisfaction from winning**, and having progressed through my own "prove I'm smarter than everybody" phase in MtG, I find it extremely disgusting and off-putting when I run into anybody who does get enjoyment out of winning (or, even moreso, anybody who's childish enough to not enjoy anything they're not winning).  

**I derive nearly all of my satisfaction from this hobby by sharing it with others, and seeing that light come over their faces in the middle of a game they've never played before, when they step outside of the rest of their life and 'get' why I like boardgames.** So... I guess what I'm getting at is... I really like converting people into gamers, but I rarely like gamers. As long as anybody is 'less' of a gamer than me, I enjoy being around them and 'educating' them. But as soon as I run into somebody who thinks they're 'more' of a gamer than me, I lose interest immediately.
In my opinion if you bend cards, you're the devil! My friends think I'm just being ridiculous but I'm standing firm!
* Lords of Waterdeep actually is very thematic and incorporates the theme well. 

* Suburbia, while being a great game, is absolutely NOT "Sim City in a box".

* Magic is still a better game that most games. 
Games that gamers love that I either can't stand or think are 'meh':

* **King of Tokyo** - supposed thematic game often comes down to just rolling dice for victory points.

* **Agricola** - There's a difference between 'tight' and 'restrictive', and this game is on the wrong side of the line. Loathe how you lose points if you don't have at least one cow, one sheep, etc.

* **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - AP inducing and clunky - the builder can look at every person's needs and spend 20 minutes on pricing.

* **Pandemic** - it's not bad. But not spectacular.

* **Sushi Go** - fun for about five minutes, then I'm ready to move on. Can't get playing this over and over.

* **Coup** - random guesswork, over and over.

* **Bohnanza** - trading games that go on forever give me a headache.

* **Mystic Vale** - despite card crafting, feels like a vanilla deckbuilder with not enough cards in the deck and some balance issues.

* **Terra Mystica** - Power wheel thingy is gamey and stupid. Setups can be imbalanced depending on race selection.
Hating Catan is par for the course. The unpopular opinion (at least on Reddit and BGG) would be to like it. Which I do.

The weekly mega thread is pointless. Instead of topics being visible on the front page and clearly delineated, they're buried in that thread. I don't even bother with it at this point.
I enjoy Carcassonne but there is a married couple I regularly game with who adore the game and have bought practically every single expansion and insist that we play with said expansions whenever we play. I now find that I loathe playing the game with them as it gets overly complicated with so many minor rules adjustments and ultimately it extends the game time so much so that I feel it outstays its welcome. 

I also hate Cards Against Humanity as it's not really a "game" but I seem to be in the minority on this in my gaming group. I keep trying to push "Say Anything" as an alternative as there is actually a game there and many of the question cards could be interpreted to be risque if you desired without it being forced on you a-la CAH.
Sad I got to this thread so late. I have two big ones that haven't already been said by others so much:

- I never Kickstart. I see its potential, and I think it's right for *some* projects, but for the most part I see it as the stupidest gamble a consumer could ever make. They pretend to be an investor in exchange for a product that didn't have a good enough concept to secure traditional funding. Granted, sometimes boardgames are tough to sell to a traditional publisher. But there's a reason for that. This space can be BRUTAL, and truly great games are truly rare. This space is brutal precisely because.........

- If boardgames are movies and television, the FLGS is Blockbuster. This ship has sailed. We, as consumers, are incredibly lucky to have a wide variety to pick from, but that same variety has made shops irrelevant. When I board game shop, I click through Amazon. I read reviews, find playthroughs, and research. If I can afford a $50 board game, I sure as hell can afford to play it some place nicer than the dingy little game shop with a body odor problem. Board game cafes seem to be catching on, but they have the additional difficulty of competing as restaurants (always difficult). Amazon isn't just endangering the FLGS. Electronics shops (even Best Buy) are having trouble as a result of this business model. It's extremely consumer friendly. Give me what I want, at a cheaper price, and you'll put it on my doorstep in two days time? Hell yeah. Added bonus: No smelly people. Well, I mean, there's my dog, but she smells pretty good (for a dog) and isn't a people.
**T.I.M.E. Stories** - Not impressed with the mechanics, and I think the theme of fantasy is a huge miss.  Think of all the great time travel stories there have been, adding fantasy monsters and magic was not necessary at all.  I can't overstate how disappointing that moment was when my group realized we were playing a fantasy games with monsters in it.

**Mythos Tales** and **Mansions of Madness 2nd edition** each take different elements of it and just do it way better.  
I think Agricola is much better than Caverna. Agricola hits that itch for a hard, starving worker placement game. Caverna comes off as a partial point salad when compared to Agricola. I have other games that fit my point salad category.
98% of the games are ugly.

And I'm not just talking about original **Through the Ages**. Most of the games look like they're drawn by some grown up fantasy/scifi fanfic illustrator. Be it some unknown publisher or FFG (I like **Netrunner**, but only because I like cyberpunk so much). And what grinds my gears the most - there is so little variation in style! It's all drawn the same. It's pretty much dominated by two styles - "fanfic fantasy" (all of FFG, Days Of Wonder etc) and "minimal hip kickstarter" (**Exploding Kittens**, **Tiny Epic** and the ilk).

A couple of exceptions:

* Ian O'Toole - **Vinhos Deluxe Edition** is beautiful. And his other games are very nice. I like what I see from **Lisboa** so far, although a bit skeptical about the visuals as an actual game. Mostly worried that it's going to be difficult to make everything out. (It's beautiful otherwise).
* **Secret Hitler** - seriously good work on the boards and components.
* **Glory To Rome** black box - one day I hope to be able to buy it. Until then, it looks nice in the pictures.

This sub needs to take a riff off of r/SquaredCircle and have a Zero Fucks Friday. Get out your weekly gaming frustrations all at once. 
**Cards Against Humanity** is a lot of fun with clever people.
**Cosmic Encounter** is possibly one of the worst things I have ever played. This is how I've described it before: "Take a turn, achieve nothing, don't use your power because it's so contextual, hope you get another turn, wait 20 minutes while everyone else takes their turn, game ends before you get a second turn".

Using dice to resolve things seems a bit lazy. Sure, it can represent uncertainty, or a one in a million lucky shot being pulled off, but if my giant, elite dude is shooting at your crappy grunt and I can't hit once because of an unlucky dice roll, that's not fun or uncertainty, that's frustrating and badly designed.
I think Orleans is garbage. 

I think Scythe is mediocre, unpolished and enormously overrated. 

I think games with ten thousand cardboard chits and fifty options per turn are overdesigned and need the boardgame version of a good editor (Feast for Odin is a good example). 

I think Splendor is fine, but can't really understand why people on this sub love it so much. 

I think Kickstarter is mostly a toilet idiots flush money down. 

I think boardgame reviews are awful. It's 80% rules explanation, 10% rambling and 10% vague opinion on the game without much real insight. The shining exception is All the Games You Like Are Bad. If I want a rules breakdown, I'll read the rulebook. Or make that a separate video. I want a review to tell me how a game actually is.  
Catan and Kemet are best as 2-player games. 
I like the box art for Concordia. Thunderstone Advance is better than Dominion. If you don't make the cards face the right way, you're human garbage. Cards Against Humanity and Munchkin can be fun sometimes. I like how Kingdom Death Monster looks unpainted more.
I'm bored of hearing about Kingdom Death Monster, I understand that a lot of people like it and it's meant to be a fantastic game but it's been taking over every slightly related discussion recently. I think the last straw was when two of the kickstarters I am involved in just now (Dark souls and Deep Madness) were both full of KDM comments.  
If you want to talk about the game nobody is stopping you but make your own thread please! And don't swamp other discussions with it. 
Legacy games. I just cannot, no matter how many times people defend and explain it, wrap my head around paying twice as much or more for a version of a game that gives me limited use and no resell value, as opposed to a game with virtually unlimited replayability, expansions, and still be able to resell or trade it when I'm finished for others to enjoy.
Chess is not very fun.
I really am not worried in the slightest if people damage my games by accident. I find it really rather petty when people do freak out about this. So ok, a drink spilt on the card, there are so many options to deal with this situation, dry it off and move on, let the person buy a new one, ask company for a replacement, it's a bother sure, but worrying about this for the rest of time and implementing strong rules around people being alowed to drink near a game is just Ridiculous, chances are you are treating grown adults like children and even children hate that kind of treatment.  (Intended damage is a whole other thing though. And i give concessions to certain games I.e PLEASE for the love of god no drinks on the table during jungle speed.)

I don't mind random elements in games (In fact I love them!) 

Unbalanced games do not bother me as long as everyone has a fair crack at getting the over powered stuff (I'm looking at you small world)

I Adore Worn copies of games. They feel loved, used and have soul. 

I hate card protectors, they feel clunky, take away from the beauty of so many games and are a real pain in the ass to shuffle. They also take away the ability to fit a game back in the box correctly (in those rare occasions a box has any semblance of decent design.

People need to stop talking about how good a game is and talk about why it is interesting instead. Myself included.
This might be stepping on some toes, but that's what this topic is for: The Resistance is a boring, mechanical pile of garbage with no thought required. The fact that it needed a bunch of expansions and then had to be reworked into a new game just proves my point.
I think Twilight Imperium is the worst game ever made, and I love space games. It was 4 hours of diplomacy with 30 min of combat and there was soooo much downtime. 

Race to the galaxy, but this is a me problem more than anything. I just don't get the strategy and am no good at it
**Inis** looks terrible to me. I don't like the art style and the design of the tiles. It may be done well for the art style, but it isn't for me. Throw the drafting mechanics and the weird combat of the game on top of that and I lose all steam. 

WOO, already downvoted for sharing an unpopular opinion on a thread for unpopular opinions! And back to the baseline.
Having a large collection with loads of games that only got played once (or never) is a waste of money and you're not really a board gamer if this is you. You're a collector. 
I really, really enjoy Munchkin, its one of my favourite games and I never get tired of it. 

Even though its not remotely balanced and the result can be fairly random, I just really enjoy the experience and its one of the games I most enjoy losing.
I'm sick of being the guy who always has to read the rules and explain the game to you. If you want to play, then read it yourself. 
One Night Ultimate Werewolf is just total guessing and therefore not a game at all. If your role changes every time, what's the point? At least there is a cool deduction you can make in Masquerade.

Catan is really boring.
Android Netrunner is exceedingly boring. 
Here's a crazy opinion: Seafall is a good game. There I said it.
I don't "get" the *Cosmic Encounter* hype. Every time I've played it it's just felt boring or unbalanced. Which I'm told is part of the appeal (the latter part). 

I'm sure with the right group and races I could love it though, maybe I'll give it another spin.
There's nothing wrong with light or party games. If that's not your cup of tea, that's fine. It just gets old to hear people dismissing them as gateway or fillers, or groan about how their six friends don't want to break off into smaller groups for heavy games. Most people like to socialize a little and view it as pleasant instead of a chore that gets other warm bodies to the table.
I'm with you. The Legacy games are pointless to me and I couldn't care less about them. Although I like Carcassonne and Catan I only kind of like them and will play them with folks who are not normally into board games as they are decent gateway starting games. I really dislike the games like One Night Werewolf and Codenames. Really I am not that into most co-op games and anything resembling a party game. The only exception is Telestrations. That game is a hoot with the right group of people and routinely leaves me sore from laughter. Not a big fan of really long games either. Some of the folks at my LGS love Twilight Imperial 3 but the idea of playing a game for 8-12 hours is insane. I could get 3-6 other game sessions into that same period of time and have much more fun. I probably should try it and most likely will one day but so far I have been avoiding it. 
Unpopular opition: There's no such thing as "multiplayer solitaire". Even if you're playing a completely solitaire game (**Yahtzee** or **Reiner Knizia's Decathlon** come to mind; games that are effectively each player doing their own thing), by simply playing it together with people and setting the objective of scoring the highest/fastest/whatever to win, you have created interaction. "Low interaction", maybe, but clearly not "no interaction". (Corollary: **Dominion** is no way multiplayer solitaire; it has more interaction than Yahtzee and Decathlon.)

And I can actually back it up with reasoning. Suppose there are two possible moves; one is low risk low reward, a guaranteed middle-ish score, and the other is high risk high reward, a chance to get a high score but probably scoring low otherwise. (e.g. In Yahtzee: score that pair of Sixes, or try to go for that Large Straight; in Decathlon: keep your current score, or do another attempt where you can score higher or lower.) The fact that you have an opponent might cause you to select a different move: when you're leading, you'll probably try to keep the lead and do the first option, while when you're trailing, you'll want to give yourself a chance to win and take the second option.

(Yes, this breaks down if your only sole aim is to score a high score, where in that case you'll always take the option with highest possible reward, no matter how small the chance. If you only play for high score instead of to win against opponents, you might as well play alone.)
Well, I might as well throw out my own unpopular opinions, I guess. This thread has exploded today. 

* I didn't enjoy Pandemic Legacy for one specific reason - that it encourages you to destroy or deface game components. I just can't personally get past that concept, so it ruins the fun I might otherwise have.
* I don't sleeve anything. Even hidden role games. I just can't stand the feel of sleeves on cards. They're either too slick or too tacky and all of them feel awful to handle, shuffle, and have pokey corners.
* I'm tired of zombies. If a game has zombies in it I'm going to pass on it. The concept is so tired and overdone. I'm *almost* to that point with H.P. Lovecraft and Cthulhu, but not quite. Zombies are worse for me.
After reading this thread, it seems that people think hating Catan is an unpopular opinion. However, the major consensus of this subreddit is that everyone hates Catan.

I think my unpopular opinion on Catan is that it is a great gateway game. Perfect for beginners to start the hobby, but easy to move passed once they realize there's more out there.
I think **Blood Rage** is highly overrated (*gasp*).  It's very swingy, the play is generally uninteresting, and almost everything you do in the 1st and 2nd age are negated by the high scoring 3rd age.  Great miniatures to be sure, but I am definitely in the minority in not seeing why this game is so popular.
**DungeonQuest** is fun.
Cosmic Encounter is just horrible.
Scythe, Blood Rage, Spyfall are all very mediocre games. OK but not that much fun. These are horribly overrated.
Theme matters a lot. A mechanic-only game wouldn't even be attractive to hobby gamers like us. Think about it, how many theme-less games do you play? Even **Hive** manages to squeeze a "theme" on what is a perfect pure mechanic game
Theme is vastly overrated. Also, most gamers don't use the term correctly, or at least specifically. Theme is how well the game integrates the topic of the game and is either strong or weak. Just because a game has a strong theme doesn't mean it's good (or that it's a good thing) and because the theme is weak doesn't mean it's bad. When gamers talk about theme, they typically mean topic ("I like games about Batman!") or chrome ("this game has such beautiful bits!"). For me, theme falls by the wayside very quickly. I appreciate a well-themed game, but if no one spent time making the actual game experience smooth and fulfilling, I don't care.

Judging from this sub, boardgamers are some of the least interesting group of people I've ever experienced. 99.9% of the topics are trash. COMC, WSIG, How can I pay less money. Also, they are the cheapest group I've ever encountered. Few go farther to save less. And they are prone to conspiracy theories and think the boardgame industry is some giant conglomerate out to screw all the little guys. (Asmodee)

Miniatures rarely add to a game and most of the time detract. They become the focus of the experience rather than the game itself and the people that you're playing with. Visual abstraction is a vital, beautiful, and grossly underestimated thing.

Don't make lighthearted jokes about how lame and uninteresting the Dice Tower is. People love the Dice Tower, even though top 10 lists are the cheapest and laziest form of content.
Stats like "sanity" or "charisma" do nothing for me. 

"You die if your sanity hits 0"
"So it's just a different type of HP?"
"No, because it goes down at different times and represents something different."

Uh-huh. Sure.

I love story and theme in games, but things like "Prestige" or "Betrayal tokens" mean nothing to me. I'm more of a fan of "your ship in Galaxy Trucker wins because it has more guns." 
Euros are actively worse than being at work. They are mind numbing, boring, and I don't even get paid for it. I don't see why people play them, but then again I don't see why people memorize train schedules or bus routes either.
I can't stand the Dice Tower guys especially Vasel. I've tried and I just can't watch more than 3 minutes. Oh and that other big bald guy irritates me too. I just don't know why they're so popular but to each their own. We all see the world through our own eyes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I love rahdo and Rodney though. 
Most theme(s) in board games are dry and uninspiring. Just give me fun mechanics.
Dominant Species isn't worth the substantial portion of your life that you have to give for one playthrough. It's a fine game and interesting the first few times but after 2 or 3, there's very little payoff. Turns get too swingy in one game that it's not worth trying to make a long-term plan. 
Oh, the inevitable conversation...


"You like board games?  Have you heard of Settlers of Catan?"


Ugh.  I hate Catan.  Carcassonne isn't much better.


As for my unpopular opinions... I consider myself a board game aficionado despite the fact that I really, really don't like anything that's too hard to figure out/teach to others.  I like an easy, intuitive and fun game.  Some people seem to think that more complicated == better, but I just can't get into anything too intense.
I think it's more important to play for fun than to win. If you're going to commit to more than an hour of a game, you should be enjoying the experience, not desperately trying to win and getting sour when it looks like you're losing. I would rather have fun and lose than have a bad game and win. If you're playing a 3+ player game, and everyone is of similar skill levels, statistically you're more likely to lose. So you should accept that, play well and be fun to play with. 
I don't understand why everyone likes Star Realms so much. I feel like it's a very shallow game compared to most of the other deck builders I've played. 
* Player elimination is fine and actively better than the alternatives for certain types of games.

* If you sleeve your cards of a non-CCG, you're weird. Maaaybe Dominion is an exception.
I don't understand why (almost) everyone is so precious about their components. I use rubber bands on my cards (no, they're not "ruined"), I always have a drink at the table (it's fine, seriously), and I always, always snap my cards (it's *fun*). And you know what? My games still look great. 

It's unbelievable to me how many posters shriek about the above behavior as if it's the height of thoughtless disrespect. Game components are built to handle playing; they're not delicate porcelain sculptures.  
Codenames is not great.  

Pictures is much more fun...but I was over the original after about 2 plays.  
*Edit: Seeing the downvotes come in, I am guessing my opinion on these types of threads is unpopular too. Well then boys and girls, by all means let loose on games you hate without clarifying your position. A great thread to read it shall be.*




Well, isn't this thread going to be a little ray of sunshine. Can we have positive threads on this sub, or at least some criticisms supported by some actual text?

This thread will devolve into:

"Scythe is shite"

"Terra Mystica is terrible"

"I fukkin hate Agricola"


(literal quotes from this thread).

This does nothing to further discussion, it only invites people to come in and dump on games that many people enjoy.
1. Large collections are dumb. Nobody needs more than ~20 games
2. Board gamers are WAY too competitive. I love heavy games with strategic decisions, but man it's better to laugh, drink, and loose a game rather than be an insufferable know-it-all who wins all the time.
A board game doesn't really interest me unless it can show some serious strategic depth. Additionally I have a lower opinion of games that have a randomizing factor in gameplay. As much as I like to roll dice or draw from a deck of randomly shuffled cards, it just doesn't have the same appeal as games with complete information awareness like chess or baduk.
Randomness after you make a choice is not okay to me. I'm okay with games with dice that you roll then choose what to do with the result, but I hate games where you choose to do something, roll, and cross your fingers. I find it lazy game design, and I find people who like it to have poor tastes. 

I think games like pandemic are not even games. I think they are activities, much like a jigsaw activity is a puzzle but not a game.
I think euro games that have little or no player interaction are trash. If I'm sitting at a table with other people, I would like to be interacting with them and not playing solitaire.
I think Rodney Smith assassinated JFK.
"Sleeving is unnecessary."

I get it. You spent a lot of money on your game, and you want to keep it pristine. I have, in fairness, actually sleeved a couple games. *Food Chain Magnate* was one, because it has a lot of card handling, and because it's an expensive game that won't get an abundance of reprints. 

Generally though, I avoid sleeving cards, because A) I don't like how it feels in my fingers, or during shuffling, B) I don't like how they look (the glare), and C) I don't have the time or energy to spend sleeving. 

Now, to be fair, I don't play a lot of "card games". Most of the games I spend a lot of time with are "board games" that may sometimes have some cards, but they aren't handled a lot. A few have more cardplay, but honestly, even if my cards get enough play to get a little worn, I don't think I'll mind. 


Well I can definitely tell based on my most downvoted comment here that saying 2 player games aren't board games to me is an unpopular opinion. I still love playing 2 player games, but to me when I think of board games I'll always think of a group of people coming together. Not me duking it out against my friend.

I also struggle with calling deckbuilders board games to for that matter unless they have an actual board game component. So while I love Legendary Encounter: Alien. It's not a board game.

The definition is just so loose these days that people on here would call Bridge a board game. That's ridiculous.
**Munchkin** 
I dont like it, just not my cup off tea.
It could also have something to do with my playgroup.
Euros, by and large, are incredibly boring experiences and the people who play them almost always come across as very elitist.  
I dislike **Carcassonne**, **Ticket to Ride**, **Five Tribes**, **Cosmic Encounters** and **Blood Rage**.

Also, **Pandemic Legacy: Season 1** was meh...it was ok, I guess.  I probably won't play another legacy again.

I'm not sure what games I enjoy that other people tend to hate.  There are some games I enjoy that my wife doesn't though:  **Sentinels of the Multiverse**, **The Grizzled** and **Mage Knight**.
I don't like 7 wonders duel and kind of enjoy the 2 player from the base game
mine seems to be that i absolutely cannot stand Mysterium, i am quite the butt of jokes when the group trieds to bring it to a session lol
**Viticulture** (at least the 1st edition) is swingy nonsense. 

Edit - added bold. 
I, hate, **Keyflower**.
A lot of socially inept gamers try and use the immediate meta for dating. But it never works. I know one woman who "only" wants a b/f who plays boardgames, like that's all that matters. She basically jumps any guy who is less than a 4/10 who joins the group, dates him for a month, calls it off as they have nothing in common and the guy never comes back.

Also, most gamers can't explain a game. They'll just parrot out the rulebook.
Theme doesn't matter.

It can be useful if mechanisms have thematic tie-ins, but it isn't necessary. I'd rather have an interesting mechanism that doesn't make sense thematically than have my mechanisms twisted to fit the theme. Just give me interesting game play that challenges me mentally.

Oh, and there are only two acceptable ways for dice to be used in a game: 1) As multi-sided markers that you set to the appropriate face, or 2) as resources that you decide what to do with them after they are rolled, as long as either all players use the same pool of dice (drafting) and/or one value isn't strictly better than others.
I seem to be alone in disliking **Tin Goose**.
Agricola is boring and overrated.
Catan sucks, Ticket to Ride sucks, Cosmic Encounter sucks, Carcassone sucks, Race for the Galaxy is overrated but I'm willing to give it another shot, Dominion is awesome, Rebellion is awesome, Tom Vasel is an idiot.
Tanto Cuore > Dominion (but I love both)

Mage Knight should not be dismissed for being "too complex" or "too fiddly"

Minis look better unpainted 99% of the time


Wasn't impressed with **Smallworld**, and the more times I played it, the worse my impression.  Very much the same thing ad-nauseum with a +1 thrown around on different things here and there.  You are doing the same things at the beginning, middle, and end of the game (with a different picture and a +1 on something or a "bend 1 rule").

Also **Roll for the Galaxy** left me wondering what the fuss is about and why people like it so much.  I don't get it.  That game sits on my shelf after 2 and a half plays and hasn't been touched since.

**Monsterpocalypse** is a game I love, but never got too popular.  Its almost a perfect game for me.  Dudes on a Map, nice miniatures, not too long, great theme, dice chucking, and tactical.
I'm with you on Carcassonne. That game is *so boring*.  
I found Sherriff of Nottingham to have no game to it at all.  
Betrayal at the House on the Hill is the only game I've ever sold because it was so terrible.
I'm all for being inclusive, but often I want to play my copy of Puerto Rico or Tzolkin without having to worry about accommodating the new people who want something light.
I seem to be alone in that I didnt enjoy Terraforming Mars.  Felt like several hours of us all looking at our cards and moving production levels up and down.  I'm generally not a fan of games where all the rules are on the cards (I'd rather have an elegant set of rules and generic pieces).  And no, we didnt try the drafting version (cant remember if this was a variant, or the advanced game).
I sort of hate Eurogames. How many ways are there to construct a [insert building name here] using [insert resource name here]. They're cold, calculated and mostly predictable.
I think Ignacy is an over rated designer. The rulebook for Robinson crusoe was terrible, Stronghold first and second edition were pretty mediocre, rattle, battle and grab the loot and the witcher board game were outright awful. Imperial settlers and robinson feel like flukes. 
I think **Thunderstone: Advance** is an excellent deck builder, as is **Marvel Legendary**.

In general, I like nearly all games the way they were designed - without game changing expansions!  Extra content that fits seamlessly into the game (extra cards for Agricola or deck builders, extra alien races for Cosmic Encounter) are fine.  Adding rules with an expansion feels like listening to a cover band.  Someone else did it better first and you're going to come along and make it better?  Don't think so...
Hmm... well, from what I've read in other threads and forums, I suppose this will be unpopular, but I absolutely **love** *luck-fest* games. Give me dice to chuck and a deck to shuffle and I'm pumped. I can't stand seeing all the "getting card-screwed" or "the game can be ruined by a bad dice toss" comments. That's part of the game, people!!! Grrr... still, I love the feeling of dice in my hand and to hear them roll across the table. And never knowing quite which card is coming up next in the deck.

Don't get me wrong, I love my euros, too, but they're just not as engaging for me without that extra gamble. 

Now please excuse me while I go play a game of **CandyLand**. 
Cost = 👎
Paper money is good.

"Multiple paths to victory" is a nonsense concept.
Terra Mystica is uuuuuugggllllyyyyy

E: Dude, most everybody on this sub acknowledges Catan is a good as a gateway, but not great overall. 
Fukkin hate Agricola.
Scythe is shite. 

Terra mystica is terrible.




I always have great fun playing Munchkin and most experienced gamers don't like it at all. 
This is an unpopular opinion at least among casuals.

Roll'n'do is not "Hyggeligt".
Mage Knight is a fun killer. Your turn is a lot of fun that is killed by the insane amount of downtime.
Kingmaking is a necessary evil.

Now my logic in this is that sometimes you get into games where you are the underdog for most of the time and know your chances of getting a decent end score are slim, you get beat down even more because it benefits the other player. 

The only reasonable way of combatting this in my mind is threatening the attacker with "If you do this, I'll make sure you get second place". Few things are more frustrating than becoming the punching bag in boardgames and the threat of kingmaking makes people want to consider other less optimal plays.
7 Wonders sucks. It's entirely possible to lose the game by the time your turn comes around in the first round.
I don't like a large majority of the people who enjoy this hobby. They do not help in bringing in new people. 
It's so frustrating, I love this hobby and everything about but just too many people are a bad stereo type. Overweight, sexist, smelly, social inept wall huggers. I've just moved from London. I had an amazing group a great bunch of down to earth friends. When I play I want to play with friends not just play games. 
It all changed when I got here, I found a group 5 min walk from my house meets twice a week! Amazing! I went once. Out of 15 people not a single one could maintain eye contact, hold a conversation or not make my fiancé not feel really uncomfortable from the staring (she only came because we'd just literally moved into our house and we knew no one) 

It's soooo frustrating because this hobby is so good! There's nothing else that can bring people together in the same way that Boardgames can. 

I'll keep on searching for a group of people I can call my friends and play games with. In the meantime I'll keep on playing solo. 
Ironically the most upvoted opinions in these threads by their very definition are the least applicable responses.
Eric Lang makes weakly designed, terrible board games 99 percent of the time. People overlook this because of Blood Rage. 
I hate both Cards Against Humanity and Munchkin. Neither really turn out to be much of a game. With CAH the humor is so poor that you can often pick a card at random and have the same chance at "winning". With Munchkin you can ignore 90% of the game put everyone at level 9 and watch everyone kill each other until someone gets lucky.

Both are popular but I just can't suffer them.
Drinks, not even water, should be allowed on the same table as the board games. Not even with a sippy cup! Most people think I'm a bit too crazy for having this attitude... but maybe they'd understand if they actually had to pay for the games themselves -_-
Apples to Apples is funnier than CAH.  

When everything is funny, nothing is funny.
Fuck Dominion. 
I hate Love Letter.
**Galaxy Trucker** is a god awful game, with literally no decision making.
Uh? You mean each case-book would be hard- rather than soft-back? I imagine that'd bump the cost of manufacture and shipping (increased weight) dramatically.

Alternatively, I suppose, you could have all the cases in one hard-back book, but then that would be inconvenient as you'd have to keep finding the right case and there would be a risk of reading the clues for the right location but wrong case when investigating a lead. I suppose this particular problem could be mitigated somewhat by adding a couple of ribbon bookmarks, but I feel like the current system would still be preferable.
How do you figure it'd cost the same?
What on earth makes you think that would cost the same? 
As far as I understand it you should only get the bonus on the actual attack. 
Yup, the +1 on a march is only if that march initiates a battle. 

In your case, you marched in and resolved your march order (removing it). If you are later attacked in that region, you get no bonus from the march that brought you there, regardless of when it was in the past (just now or 10 turns ago).

I enjoy lords of waterdeep 2 players but i think a few people actually enjoy Terra Mystica 2 players even though I think the board is perhaps too open with 2.


Lords of Waterdeep is probably better at 2, but they are pretty different games really. What sort of game were you looking for? 

Lords of Waterdeep is a light-medium worker placement game while Terra Mystica is a medium-heavy resource management / network building game.

Any other info you can provide on your game preferences?
Definitely Lords of Waterdeep if you're talking exclusively two player. Terra Mystica's area control and cult board mechanisms are nowhere near as effective at the 2 player counts.
I'd actually recommend [Champions of Midgard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014TKCZ4K/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3SX0702PZVGKF&coliid=IWJ3RRWI93NWM) over either of them 2p. Champions of Midgard is VERY similar to Lords with, in my opinion, more things to do. It plays pretty well with 2p and even better with 3 or 4.
Lords of Waterdeep in my experience, Terra Mystica is just brilliant with more players. 
As someone who absolutely adores Terra Mystica, I can honestly not recommend it for 2 players. It's not bad, but it's just not nearly as good with 3-5 players. 

Lords of Waterdeep, however, excels as a 2 player game with the expansion (in my opinion, only play with the expansion). Sure, some cards are not as well balanced, bit as a whole, it's a very fun experience and I can't recommend it enough. 
Terra mystica is not good 2 players 
At 2-players, Dungeon Pets uses a dummy player. But honestly... it's not the bad. All you are doing is moving meeples/goblins clockwise on different tracks after each round. 

Mechanically, its around the same weight as Alchemist and Archipelago. But in practice, it feels quite brain-burning as you try to optimize your score for the end-of-the-round. There are a lot of interesting decisions to make and the game feels quite puzzly as you try to maximize things without killing your pets. Furthermore, many of those decisions center around obtaining an easier payout or taking risks for a higher payout; but don't think it is push your luck... the risk comes with trying to plan multiple rounds ahead and account for everything to properly raise/feed/etc your pets. 

I like it quite a bit. I think many gamers think Dungeon Lords is a stronger title... but I find Dungeon Pets to be less obtuse. 

If I had to complain... two issues with the game. First, the components are average and the cards are a non-standard size, which is one of my pet peeves. You can now get sleeves for the game but that wasn't true when the game first came out. Secondly, the game has blind bidding (you separate workers into groups and the largest group go first). This does create for some tension but I'm not a fan of blind bidding... especially in heavier euros. That being said, it's not that influential. 
I love Alchemists and Dungeon Petz, so I think you'll love Dungeon Petz as well!

Compared to Alchemists, Dungeon Petz shares the same worker placement mechanic but is considered lighter because DP has no deduction part. DP also encourages you to plan for few rounds ahead (to compete in contest and sell petz to buyers). DP is a little bit more random than Alchemists in my opinion because you need to draw and fulfill the pets' needs, which can vary and might caught you unguarded. DP shares the similar taste of humour with Alchemists.
What would you describe as a stressful, frustrating game? I love Dungeon Petz but it can be a tight worker placement game when playing with 4 people (more akin to Agricola then Viticulture).
I've played them all. I still own Archipelago and Viticulture, and I suspect if you're a fan of all three of those games... you're going to like Dungeon Petz. It's quite a big game, maybe on par with Archipelago for complexity... and it has a lot of cool variation. I'd say go for it... even with 2p, which uses a "blocking player" that moves around the board to reduce your choices. Easy to manage.
(Subscribing, since I find myself in the same position!)

Corollary: is Dungeon Petz solo-able in any capacity? Because I'm a sad lonelyboi
I would say "yes".
... Probably? 

It's great. I like Alchemist, and own but haven't played the other two.
Yeah dude dungeon petz is a solid heavier-medium game. You are playing probabilities like whoa when assigning needs to your petz and that can be stressful but the stories you can tell are quite entertaining "ghosty tried to burst magically out of his cage and took a massive dump while straining" etc 

It's up to you though we cannot gauge what you find stressful or frustrating. Euros oftentimes can define frustrating as you generally can't do everything you need/want to in the period of game time and DP is definitely no exception.
What I know of Viticulture, I'd like to think Dungeon Petz is slightly lighter so I bet you'd be fine. At first glance it seems like a lot, but it's fairly simple. I've taught some very inexperienced people how to play and that's gone over well. The iconography is very clear. As long as you have at least one person taking care of the very minimal end-of-round bookkeeping bits and notifying others what to expect for the next round you're good to go. 

I love Dungeon Petz. Just make sure to scoop that poop! 
I have the wooden version, I'd say it's not worth it. It's pretty expensive and dexterity games rarely hits the table. At least not for me. I was pretty excited about it but it will wore of and now I never play it.

At least the box is pretty.
The plastic version is definitely good. The two versions play marginally different due to the materials but neither is a worse experience than the other.   
I have the plastic version but I wish that I had bought the wood version. The main reason being the wood version allows you to play all the expansions since they are in wood as well.

That being said, I'm not huge on buying expansions in general (for any game, not just Flick Em Up), so it's not a big deal. The plastic version is actually surprisingly nice. The plastic is nice and rounded, no sharp edges or flashing, the pucks have a solid weight to them, the insert is vacuum formed and fits all the pieces in perfectly. All in all, I'm satisfied with the plastic version. I think for the price you can't go wrong.

Just keep in mind that the wood pieces will have a bit more texture/weight to them and the wood version will be compatible with expansions.
Can't compare directly, but the plastic version is great. If anything, I think it's less fragile than wood. I've seen my fair share of broken meeples... The plastic pieces don't seem to decrease playability from what I can tell. I'd save the money and buy a whole other game with it. (Well, that's exactly what I *did* do.)
I have the plastic version and can vouch for the quality - it's really nice. The flicking pieces have a weight in them to make them more satisfying to use.

And I prefer the smaller box and price.
Indeed. And the two boxes from each season form a larger panorama when placed side by side. If there's a season 3, perhaps the boxes will complete the center row of the watch face.
I'll admit I haven't paid a ton of attention, but I'm pretty sure the expansion is not out yet.

Predator is good, though.
Predator is really good as a stand alone game, but it's not compatible with Aliens. At least, it's no more compatible than Marvel Legendary or any of the other Legendary's. You *can* combine them, but it's clunky and limited.

The Aliens expansion though looks really really good. Haven't had a chance to try it, but I am excited.
Apples and Oranges.  There is no way to really answer this.  The games are VERY different.  What is it you don't like about Catan?  What do you like in games?
Castles of Burgundy is a much more complex game than the base game of Catan. 
Tough to say as they're very different games. Any other games you like or dislike?
Probably pretty good.
We need more information to help you.
Hard to compare, but I don't really ever want to play Catan. I love Castles of Burgundy, though! The Card Game version is really good, too.
The games are nothing alike as far as gameplay goes. One game is a kind of trade negotiation thing, the other is a worker placement game.
/r/hexandcounter

Even non-wargamers like Memoir '44 though. 
The **COIN** games aren't quite proper wargames, but they're a great intro, and just fantastic games in their own right. **Falling Sky** is my personal favorite.
ASLSK is really good and a lot lighter than ASL.  Combat Commander: Europe is a favorite when we can get time to get it on the table.
Current games I love that are totally war games or could be lumped into wargames category:

- **Advanced Squad Leader** (been playing the SKs)

- **Here I Stand**

- **Combat Commander: Europe**

- **Friedrich** and **Maria**

- **Guns of Gettysburg**
If you like older history, the GBoH system by GMT has all your ancient wars covered, from chariots in Mesopotamia all the way up to the Sengoku period in Japan.
I'm a big fan of **Fire in the Lake** and **Conflict of Heroes**
Check out the [HAMTAG top list series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOlRvTbmD6tJLIbv-gm5QzEZmdcEXaTI5) 

They have toplists on best entry game, best ww2 Pacific game and many more. 

Edit [more videos under a new channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfkO0Nts6_bxO7GUFl0wpQcFHaZ-A3Ei9)
**Paths of Glory**, it's a great game. 

**Here I Stand** and **Virgin Queen** are great options.

Also COIN games are pretty good and light enough (compared to above) to appeal to a broader audience most notably **Fire in the Lake**

If you want hex-based ones, I've never played any of those... yet.
I really enjoy Conflict Of Heroes with the solo expansion. 
Heard good things about [Heroes of Normandie](http://www.iellogames.com/Heroes_of_Normandie.html) by Iello. Haven't played it yet, though.
Combat Commander, Triumph and Tragedy, MBT, the Next War series, No Retreat, Operation Dauntless.
Smallworld isn't really a great two player game, in my opinion. If you'll play with more people, you'll notice it solves a bunch of your concerns. There'll be more interaction between players, and you'll balance the over powered race/power combos with ganging up on the leader. With two players, it is way too swingy for my taste. It's still always going to be a gateway level game, but it is a FUN gateway game. Just not with two players.
**Small World** is definitely an entry-level game.  Not sure what you usually play, but perhaps you've moved beyond this already.

There is an expansion called **Tales & Legends** which greatly improves the game in my opinion.  Although I believe it can be hard to find.  It adds event cards that change up how each round of the game is played.  You can always see the upcoming event for the next round, so you can plan ahead.  This makes the game far more strategic.  That is the only way I'll play Small World anymore, but even then, I'd much rather play something else.
I have always felt Smallwood to be a gateway game,  that is, it introduces fans of Risk to the other possibilities that are out there.  It's ment to be simple and engaging.

In terms of overall strategy, it's not the deepest and shouldn't be taken as such.  I still like playing though with a cold beer and talking with the wife while playing.  The best expansions are the ones that add more armies and powers, adding more variability to the game and if you end up enjoying the game  I would look into those ones and ignore the ones that add a new board for now.

Now if you are looking for a step up for 2 player strategy games, I would like to recommend **Kemet** as a strategic area control game that plays 2-5 by changing the size of the board with the player count.  If you really love Lord of the Rings, then take a look at **War of the Ring** as the most thematic strategy game available.


You hit the nail on the head!
Smallworld is over rated and very samey.  You are doing the same thing the entire game with an occasional picture change and a +1 or rule bend here and there.
* Advanced Squad Leader
* Republic of Rome
* Banagrams

What I'm trying to say is this might go over better if you say "looking for some light games". There's tons of lists with excellent four-player light games if you root around. Just because it's your girlfriend or sorority girls who knows what they'll like? Case in point: I used to read the BGG lists about 'girlfriend games' but my ex hated those games but loved El Grande and Heroscape. My current girlfriend didn't even know I played games a lot until about a year into dating (I mostly played on my phone then, new city, few game friends) and she had about zero experience with board games since youth but was interested in trying something. Fast forward a a bit and she's been wanting to play Memoir '44 every night and switch sides after each battle. I have had tons of friends with similar experiences.

Throw them a curve but keep the length and complexity matching the situation. You never know what game someone will love until they play it.
**Marrying Mr Darcy** is really fun.

**Billionaire Banshee** is a great light discussion game.

Also **Codenames** and **Carcassone**


It depends on what they like, really. If they want laugh out loud, they should go for party games like Telestration. 

Like pretty art? Dixit, Tokaido. 

Like books and reading? Maybe try Bring Your Own Book.

Love some combat? Small World.

It's very important to consider what they like, and what they'll be looking for when outside of home. I love Tokaido and Betrayal at House on the Hill, but i won't play either outside because i like there to be some specific environment -- old japanese and haunting music respectively. 
Beyond Baker Street or Hanabi might work, as it keeps them all talking. I'd pick BBS first, but don't know the availability. 

Tokaido I'll second. Pretty chill. 

Red 7 for something extra light, but interactive enough and keeps you focused. 

Love Letter because it's easy to talk around or about the game. 
One of my favorite four player games is Red Dragon Inn. I don't think it's too complicated(no more than Catalan) and they get to drink and beat each other up :)
Exploding kittens and boss monsters. Maybe munchkin. They're all three pretty simple but get really cheeky
I just played it for the first time on Friday with a gaming buddy, my son, and my son's friend. 

The game was a hit with the 40 plus dudes and the 13 yo dudes. loved the drafting, pogramming, and the chaos. Beautiful game that was fun, funny and pretty light. easy to play and love.
I finished Mission 10 just yesterday and all of my sessions were full of excitement and fun! The missions' objectives and settings are quite different from one another, making each mission feel unique and we need to develop different strategies as well.

For replay value, I'd be happy to play all missions again as another campaign or only playing one mission independently. There are variants as well in BGG forum which I am looking forward to playing them next week end.
Played it for the second time last night. I was surprised how much fun... getting damaged was. I was zooping left, rotating randomly, etc. It's pretty hilarious that you instagib baddies when you run over them.

I like the game for a lot of reasons such as the high quality production of the pieces, the board and of the trays. I just feel that ultimately the game lacks depth in variety in the levels. I've already tried level 3 versions of many of the cards, plus we got our overdrives. I just feel that it's going to feel like that's the same again and again and again. It would be cool to have different cards in the deck based on the scenario you play. The blandness of the enemy also is an issue. They just spawn and move a space. You annihilate 2-4 of them regularly with great ease. I wish there was more to them such as some of them being resistant to fire, extra vulnerable to lightning, etc.

It's a cool game, but I question its staying power. It's a great game to get people into, but people who are used to playing heavier games may want to play a few levels to see if it'll keep their interest.
I have had 2 sessions of this...played tutorial and the first 2 missions.  It's fun for sure -- BUT i really like preprograming games, so maybe I'm biased.  I don't care for chrome, but I appreciate it and boy does this game pack in a lot.  
  
  I love the feeling of complete despair at the start of the game, when you hear the movement and minion spawn rules -- thinking there is no way in hell you'll do this mission [w/ 3 mechs no less]. And after a few go-arounds, you start noticing your mechs pack quite a punch and eventually it starts to become clear that the mission is indeed winnable.  It reminds me of Sentinels of the Multiverse after the 1st round, where the set up and initial villain turn are completely brutal, but the subtle grind slowly turns the tide. Yeah, I might be selling it once the campaign is over -- but I can easily see them making additional add-on scenarios [though, who knows if they will continue with this side project as it's probably not a majority priority or a huge money maker].
Just wait till you get to mission 4
For the bit about damaged mechs being useless - just repair (or don't take damage in the first place). You will need to start planning a couple turns in advance in the future. (And planning what you may need or could use on subsequent drafts)
Are there any tough decisions to be made in the game or are the choices usually quite obvious?
I picked it up even though I didn't it really looked like the game for me. Everyone was raving about it and I kept hearing that it wasn't an Ameritrash game.

Well, I got it and it's an Ameritrash game that wasn't for me :p I played a few games and I just didn't get anything out of it. Sold it last week. 

I'm glad you're enjoying it! Seems like everyone but me does haha
**Clockwork Wars** would be a great next step. Only a few minis, but I prefer this to Kemet at any player count.
You could do star wars x-wing miniatures. It's cheap and is exclusively 2 player.

I really love El Grande as a dudes on a map game, but it ditches miniatures for just cubes. Its not the most amazing thing at two players though.
I own Kemet but not the expansion. But for all I've heard and researched about it, it's really good if you like the game. Adds a whole new color that makes strategy deeper and uses even more table space!
Maybe Cyclades (with the Titan expansion)?
The extended gameplay is sort of hilarious. He misses the infect step several times in a row, forgets to draw cards, forgets to discard cards... it's a mess.

Still gives a good impression of how it plays though.
Sorry Rahdo I've stopped watching your videos.  That infectious enthusiasm is bad for my bank account.  It's best if I just don't watch.
I don't think I need another Pandemic game unless it's Legacy Season 2. This sounds neat and I like the theme but there isn't anything calling to me to get it. 
I played this with my group yesterday.  It *feels* very much like regular pandemic.  The major differences are:

* you can't eradicate diseases.  This means you have to keep on top of all the colours all the way through the game

* Your mobility is much less than what you might be used to.  No aeroplanes!  You can take a ship from one port town to another port town, if you have the cad to spend, and if the port town is anywhere near where you want to go.  We didn't use that feature the whole game!

* You can instead build railway tracks, which really, really help.  Get those bad boys down early!!

* The space *between* cities is now a thing, called a region.  You can apply abilities to a region that affect all cities touching it, e.g. 'water purification' - one water token will prevent one disease cube being placed.  Those were incredibly useful.  The nurse also has a cool region ability.

- Loads an loads of special events cards!! 

- Special 'disease' cards that add an extra element to one disease to make the game a bit tougher

I found it quite enjoyable and a nice twist.  Plus there was some nice flavour text on some of the cards with interesting historical facts.  I'm not sure it's necessary to have both regular pandemic and Iberia, as they are very similar, but if you are a big Pandemic fan like I am, then it does add some variety to a game that has already been played hundreds of times!
I'm interested in his thoughts but I can't watch any of his videos because they give me severe anxiety! Any summaries please? 
Ooh, and it's finally back in stock at MM...so very tempting.
Was very curious about this one going in, as the "it's a one-time printing, limited edition" factor has been dangled out there by the publisher. Reading up on it, though, it's a 30,000 copy print run. No need to make a blind order here. If I ever play it and like it, then I can worry about picking it up. 
For someone that has not owned a copy of Pandemic, would you guys recommend to get regular pandemic or Iberia

Castles of Burgundy

Five Tribes

Grand Austria hotel


My favorite 2p games are

Innovation

Troyes

Race for the Galaxy


Any of these games are great buys. They all support 3-4 player as well if you ever get a group together.
I like **Holmes:  Sherlock & Mycroft** as a 2 player game, especially for couples.
If you like Lord Of The Rings I think The Confrontation is brilliant, theres War Of The Ring also
My wife and I play a lot of Twilight Struggle. Fantastic two player game, takes a while to get the hang of it, but very worthwhile.
There are so many...

**Viticulture Essential Edition** is our favorite worker placement game so far. I bet it goes great with a glass of wine.

**Beyond Baker Street** is like Hanabi, with theme. I've heard Hanabi doesn't play very well with 2 players, and I like theme in my games, so I skipped straight to Baker Street. We like it a lot, as we need to co-operate and it isn't like any other games.... Well, except Hanabi. lol

**Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy** is a great little game where you're kinda doing worker placement, but mostly focusing on building out your family tree. It's cool, though it uses a lot of table space. (Our table is smallish).

**Eight-Minute Empire: Legends** if you want a lighter kind of war/area control. It doesn't last an hour, but you will probably want to play it more than once, because it's pretty good!

**Patchwork** probably takes us closer to half an hour, but it's a great little game that has the Tetris touch. I replaced the cardboard buttons with real ones for a more thematic experience.

**Jaipur** is a marketplace game. It's quick and easy to learn, and it's very highly-rated and almost always recommended, and for good reason.

**The Networks** is a cool game about running your own TV stations. You hire stars, run ads, and run shows. We dig it!

**The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** uses a lot of table space, but it's pretty great.

**The Castles of Burgundy** uses less table space than the Card Game version, but also takes longer to play. Not that big a deal, because we love it!

**Ascension: Dreamscape** or really almost any of the Ascension sets. It's a different style of deck-building than Domnion, but I like it more. If you prefer a sci-fi version, there's Star Realms, which is fairly similar.

**Cosmic Run** is a dice-chucking race to explore 5 planets. It's pretty good! The same guy made Biblios and Capo dei Capi, both of which I own and the wife and I enjoy playing all three.

**Mouse Guard: Swords and Strongholds** replaces chess for us. Well, for me. My wife hasn't played chess. It's simpler, much simpler, and shorter, but it's fun. And she wins more than I do, and it has cute little plastic mice pawns.

**Lotus** if you want set collection, with a touch of area control. Beautiful cards!

**Pandemic: The Cure** - We don't care much for the original Pandemic, but we like chucking dice in this faster, simpler version. Lots of dice, we dig it!

**Attack on Titan: The Deck-Building Game** - I don't have this yet, but it looks fun from the videos I've watched. I sold my copy of Legendary Encounters: Alien because I didn't get it to the table very often, and this is what I hope will replace it.

**Black Orchestra** - my pre-ordered copy should arrive this week, I hope. You play as members of the WWII-era Nazi party, co-operating and attempting to assassinate Hitler and save millions of lives of Jewish people. It seems respectful of the source material, and I am very much looking forward to playing it with my wife.

**New Bedford** is another worker placement game, with a whaling theme. We both really like it, despite the theme. Not as much as Viticulture, but I like it quite a lot.

**Shadowrun Crossfire** is a card game where it's simple to play, but very hard to win... We like trying to win... Someday, it'll happen.
* Patchwork: Original and awesome game mechanic, one of our favorites,

* Star Realms: awesome deck building, high replayability, fun as hell, easy to learn.

* Hive: Waterproof, fun, and portable. Out choice for playing at a bar or the beach.

* Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective: 10 chapters of murder investigation that make you feel like a real detective couple walking the streets of victorian London. Every chapter is played in 1-3 hours depending on the players, so it's a good investment for the price.  
**7 wonders: duel**

**patchwork**

This is an offshoot of The Jones Theory. I'm sitting on something like 85 games, and in the spring when I get ready to move again, I'll jetison maybe 25-30 of them and if I had to, I could get down to about 40. Realistically, I try and keep stuff that rounds out a collection (I have a few euros, econ games, wargames, social games, etc), but I don't need more than a handful of each.  

Some stuff that would stay because it either hits the table frequently, it's well liked by many, few of my friends have copies (so me getting rid of it would hinder it still hitting the table at game night) and/or it's hard to get:  

**Container**  
**Twilight Struggle**  
**1989: Dawn of Freedom**    
**Ginkgopolis**  
**One Night Ultimate Werewolf**  
**Paris Connection**  
**Sushi Go**  
**Fire in the Lake**   
**Keyflower**  
**The King is Dead**  
**Indonesia**  
**Glory to Rome**  
**Crokinole** (a Muzzies)

Some of those are for special reasons; 1989/FitL I really *really* like playing, and both I've pimped out and even had both signed which meant something to me. PC sees the table often and it's an easy game with some really deep play if you have serious players (similarly; Sushi Go is a fantastic filler that ultimately fired 7 Wonders for me). TS I have a nice set of that I've worked on, Container/Indonesia have an interesting question associated with them (as does The King is Dead in many respects but it's a totally different question). Indonesia in particular I've built a custom copy that solves a number of problems I had with the game's components because it's one of my spouse's favorite games and that mattered to her. In that vein, my copy of GtR was done using euro artwork but English text (again, custom box, new rulebook, player mats, etc). Ginkgopolis is one of the few 2p area control/influence games that not only works, but works well. Keyflower is a 2p auction game that actually works (but is better at 3 and 4), and both (along w/ Ginkgopolis) are funky games which are unique and/or sort of difficult to acquire at times.

A guy I know had an interesting comment; we play many games which are ultimately "churn" games. To that end, we get excited about a game, get it, play it 4 or 5 times, and then get rid of it (or it sits on the shelf, basically unplayed from then on). Sometimes its because it looks neat but ultimately isn't unique. Sometimes it's because someone talks it up in a video review and you find out it's not particularly special later. Whatever the reason, it's just a regular game, nothing stands out that makes it *the* game to have over others that are comparable. That's not to say it's a bad game, just that it doesn't light your fire particularly. Churn games are different for each person, that's part of the saving grace. This past summer at Origins, I traded almost 1/3rd of my collection. I basically traded all of my churn games in one shot. Some of what I got was also a churn game, but hey, I get to try it for a year and get rid of it at another con math trade later. The real objective is to try and cut down on (but not necessarily eliminate) *buying* those in the first place...  


>To clarify, I see culling as a method of removing a certain number of games for a host of reasons (to get to a certain number or to remove unplayed/infrequently played games), while I see distilling as the intentional removal of as many games from one's collection as possible while still remaining a fun, versatile, and replayable collection.

I fail to see the distinction you're making here. If it's arbitrary, just say so - you prefer the term "distilling" to "culling." But I don't necessarily see any difference in removing a game for one reason versus removing a game for another - it's still removing a game from your collection either way. The end result is the same. I'm pretty sure *anyone* who gets rid of a game still wants what they have left to be "fun, versatile and replayable."

<takes off pedantic hat>

I'm in a constant state of culling/distilling/reducing. I don't like having lots of "meh" games or games that do the same thing only slightly differently. I like to have one (maaaaaaybe two) excellent, fantastically fun examples of different mechanics or player counts. 

Currently I could probably remove:

* San Juan (I also own Race for the Galaxy and enjoy it more)
* Puerto Rico (scratches the same itch as RftG, but quicker)
* Marvel Legendary (Uninspired deckbuilder that the SO loves, so I'll never get rid of it. I prefer Trains.)


Games that would stay:

* Hansa Teutonica - I just don't have anything else that's close to it.
* Concordia - probably my favorite trading game for more than 2 players.
* Carcassonne - still a great tile-laying game, and no others I have are near as quick or elegant.
* Hive - no other abstract I own has its staying power.
I'd be reluctant to distill mine much. Many of the people I play with aren't really gamers, so the theme is very important. I have tons of medium complexity 4-player games, so objectively I could get rid of most of them. However, rotating between them keeps things more interesting for me since there isn't enough depth to just play one.
If I got rid of mass market games, I'd probably be sitting right around 75 games. That seems to be enough.
Quick answer, right now, 5 games.

I'm a recent Dad and it's 10PM on a work night. I took a look at my collection of board games (~60 excluding the couple dozen small form factor card/board games) and evaluated: **Which of the games in my collection would I be *excited* to start playing right now regardless of and the normal excuses and reasons I should be in bed instead?** These were the only ones that would cut through all that and get on the table (assuming I had players to hand): 

**Galaxy Trucker**

**Caverna**

**A Game of Thrones: TBG**

**Battlelore (2nd Ed)**

**Carcassonne**

Not quite the answer to your question, but it gets to the heart of what games give you the most enjoyment while still having variability and replayability. There's definitely some things missing from the above, but between variable setups (official and unofficial), expansions and depth of the above games, I could easily see myself getting in 100+ plays of this cycle of games before starting to need to inject fresh content. Thinking back to breaking into the hobby in the mid 90's, I played the death out of Catan and never got tired of it, no reason I couldn't do the same with these if I was for some reason limited to them.
Have someone in the group that is the best teacher borrow the game. Give them time to read the rules and play a practice game. Then let them explain to everyone how to play. 

Learning the rules right then and there for everyone is going to cause a headache every time. 
reading/learning the rules *prior* to the game night is pretty much key.


I will almost never pull a game out with people over without knowing the game myself. That means I've opened it, unpacked it, read the rules, set it up, played a practice game (or round, if it's a game of repeated rounds), put it back, set it up again, made sure I could identify each bit and card and where they go, give a short preamble of "This is how you win, here's how you work your way to a win" speech.

And if it's a very rules heavy game, and I know it's going to be played, I'll ask everyone coming over to take 15 minutes before arriving to watch a let's play video and then when they arrive we can have a quick "any questions before we begin" chat.
Bringing out new games heavier than, say, Carcassonne, requires preparation on part of the host/owner. Unpack the game *before* game night; read and reread the rules until you can teach the overarching points of how the game is played; and do a practice setup and teardown, which will inform your decision on how to bag all the pieces and whatnot for the quickest deployment.
Just accept that you're probably going to make mistakes in the first playthrough and don't spend too much time searching the rulebook for some small rule that may or may not be present in the rulebook. If you can't find it right away, come to a decision and stick with it.  

If you're the owner and the one that's supposed to teach it, make sure you understand the game well ahead of time. Watch several videos, read the rules, and look online for any FAQ / errata.  Every once in a while you'll come across a video that does such a great job teaching that it's easier to just sit all your friends down and watch the video with them instead of trying to explain the game -- one example of this is Blood Rage. The Watch It Played for Blood Rage is the best one of those I've found.  20 minutes, everything is taught, and it's easy to follow.  

If you do end up having to explain the whole thing, give the players what they NEED to get started.  For example, in games with lots of combat rules, just say "combat will happen if you do X action, and I'll explain how combat works when it happens". It helps to not overwhelm them right away.
The best method I know of is to have someone spend a good chunk of time (a couple hours probably) reading the rules and playing a round or two by themselves before teaching the game to others.

If this preparation has not been done, me and my friends will just play something else. Like you said, I don't know of any good way to speed it up. Watching a YouTube video is interesting and might help, but in my experience of this kinds of videos they often aren't perfect and you will have to check the book anyway.
I think when hosting any game session the owner/host should have read all the rules and ideally done a test run (either on their own or grab 1 other). 

There are lots of good rules summary/how to play videos which can be a way to start a session. I think it hard for people to pay attention though.

One other thing when playing I find is to not be too much of a rule stickler if it would ruin the flow. In a first game ignore some rules or explain them later in the game. I do this with more complex games sometimes as otherwise players just get overwhelmed. After the first game though you can introduce all the rules as everyone has the basics down.

Galaxy Trucker is a good example of a game that has this built in for your first game (ignoring some rules). Wish more games did that.

Overall though this is the worst part about the hobby. I look forward to one day there being a better system for tracking and teaching rules (Some sort of augmented reality device)

I learn the shit out of the rules to the point where I can answer pretty much any question thrown my way. This might not be helpful for your group, but as my group's teacher this is an important for me.
For heavier games I tend to find the best tutorial video I can and send it to everybody I intend to play with a few days before our game night. That way we only end up using the rulebook for elaborations and such.

Naturally this won't work in every situation. The biggest drawbacks being games that don't have instructional videos and players that may not watch them at all even when they're available.

So far my group has watched these tutorials every single time without fail and it has worked a treat (Dead of Winter included). Your mileage may vary.
As the person bringing the game to the table, you should make sure you know the rules reasonably well so you can answer the more obvious questions that will be asked. Read the rulebook, watch videos, whatever it takes for you to understand the game. It's no fun if half of the game is waiting for someone to read the rulebook every 5 minutes. I, personally, will read the rulebook in full and watch a YouTube video or two, since sometimes it's hard to understand what a rule means or what it's trying to do.
I personally like cards with condensed rules on them for everyone. Things like what you can do on your turn, what you can do on someone else's turn, what the win condition(s) are, what the pieces are, and some simple info about the stuff on the board. That way you can go over the rules once, and everyone can be looking at some of the basics instead of having to pass the book around a bunch. 

It can be difficult to figure out what to put on the cards, but after you've played you can put some of the stuff that was most confusing to you, and if you're printing them out each time you can leave a spot for notes. 
Ditto. I will never bring out a game if I haven't had a chance to read the rules and try out a few turns myself.

There is also a limit to how much new information folks can absorb before they just start switching off and it just all starts getting jumbled up. So for games with lots of rules I find that you can't just sit down and start explaining every rule.  There are some rules that aren't going to impact their strategy and are better left to be explained later during the game when that situation occurs.

I have also started showing and explaining an example turn then resetting the game.
I always play it through first, after watching a 10-20 minute video explaining the game and reading through the rule book.
It is almost never a good idea to open a game and try to learn it together for the first time. I typically teach the games, having read thru the rulebook and played a couple pretend rounds by myself previously. I'm also a teacher by trade, so that might help. Even if it's not my game I usually end up with the rulebook, after years of playing together I'm the one most trusted to be thorough and fair.
>Can you play a few games of normal risk before starting the legacy part?

You can indeed. The board is set up as normal Risk is, and you don't have to make any alterations to anything if you don't want to.

At the start of the campaign, you receive a card with two stickers on it, you choose one and apply it to your race and tear the other one up, never to be used. Probably wait on that as well if you're introducing them for the first time.

I would, however, recommend playing to 4 stars (or points) instead of the original Risk win condition of total domination.

>How friendly is it to learn?

It is not overly complex, but you will need to read the rulebook beforehand and make sure you understand it to sufficiently guide them through how to play. You can find the rulebook online to read before you buy it to see if the complexity level is more than they could handle.

However, Power Grid is weighted at 3.29 on BGG, with Risk Legacy only at 2.61, so they've played heavier.

>Is this a good replacement/step up for Catan?

I would say the only similarities between the two is that they both have dice. A better "upgrade" game would perhaps be something like The Castles of Burgundy.
>Can you play a few games of normal risk before starting the legacy part?

Eh kinda?

> Reason being, my family has never played risk before 

This is risk like, but not risk. 

>How friendly is it to learn?

It's pretty friendly/

>The heaviest game my family has played is Power Grid and even then I can't bring it out often as it is a little too long and mathy for them.

The hardest part of RL is the setup. It is easier than PG

>Is this a good replacement/step up for Catan?

It's an incredibly different game

>It's not that I hate Catan, but you do get burned out after playing every night. Doesn't burn out my family though as it's all they want to play.

If you want to give them an intro with 40k minis, you could look into Space Hulk.

That being said, (I recommend this one a lot on here, but) Mice and Mystics is an easy to learn, fun to play game with minis. It's a narrative RPG for 1 to 4 players. The minis aren't prepainted, however.

I think Claustrophobia has prepainted minis. I've never played it myself though, so I can't vouch for how good it is.
**X-Wing** has pretty wide appeal because Star Wars. Rules are surprisingly simple and can be fun for a beginner on the first game. Also, they sell the core set at places like Target so you don't have to freak them out by taking them into a proper game store to pick up a copy. Or maybe try getting a copy of the new edition of **Blood Bowl**. It's gonna be more complicated than X-Wing but it's football, so people will go in with some understanding of the basic objective of the game.
Look up kill team for 40k maybe it'll be gentler or re evaluate how you explain it?
Heroclix if they are into superheroes, Axis & Aliies miniatures by Wizard of the Coast if they are into historical games, there is also a naval version if they like fleet action, X-wing miniatures
For Star Wars or Armada for larger scale action, there was mech warrior mini game that came prepainted but I never played so I'm not familiar with how complicated the rule
Set was
Gears of War!
Found [Jack of all Dominion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minusik.apps.jackofalldominion&hl=en), which might help. Can't vouch for it though.
/r/dominion has Kingdom of the Week, where a new kingdom is up for discussion every week. I'm pretty sure it's designed (not random). Of course, it assumes you have all expansions, since it constructs from all available expansions, but sometimes you hit jackpot and get a kingdom that only uses cards you have.

I don't have Iberia so I can't say to much about it, but to me it seems it's mostly a stronger theme added since the diseases have actual names (malaria, stuff like that) instead of just colors and a variant about dealing with patients. I do have OtB and I will say that it's very fun. The virulent strain epidemic cards can really make you think since one disease will mutate and get difficult to deal with which is great, I hardly ever play pandemic without it. The extra epidemic card makes you able to play with 7, and the new event cards are also awesome. Mutant variant wasn't all that great and I haven't yet played with the bio-terrorist since I normally play with just my gf. So all that considered I'd say if the theme is super important and you really like that then Iberia but for more game play options I'd say the expansions


I totally forgot there was a first edition until now. When I encountered this problem, I sold my copy of pandemic for $20 on Craigslist and ending up buying the second edition for about the same price. Unless you really prefer first edition, i'd try and sell it and use that money to buy the up to date version. That way you can get any expansions you want down the line. 
Iberia is a one time print run, so if you're wanting that game at all I would say go for that.  The expansions should be around for quite a while.


On The Brink is the only expansion I have but I'm happy with it. It has enough ways to change the game, extra challenges, and lots of extra roles and events.
There are two visitor cards - Broker and Unauthorized Broker, I think - that let you trade lira with VP. Also it's used as tiebreaker, and that's it.

In the Tuscany board, there's the "Trade 1 for 1" spot (aka best spot ever) lets you trade 3 Lira to 1 VP as well.
Yes money is also used as a tie breaker.
Viticulture is in my top 10 all time. It's a classic that everyone should at least play and then decide if they want it in their collection. 

Does writing everything in CAPS make it high energy? 
Your note for Pandemic is misplaced - should be listed under Pandemic Legacy. I would also say that nobody needs to own both, unless they REALLY love it. I have both, and after a few games of Legacy, I'll probably never touch the vanilla game again. There is a dice game version called Pandemic: The Cure which I like more, actually.

I see Star Realms on your list. I don't like it as much as Ascension, despite the similarities.

T.I.M.E. Stories is great. My group is in love with it. But you really want to play it 4-players, and the same 4 players each time. You get one module with the base game, which you will play probably 2-4 times. Then you're done... You need to get more modules to play, which you could play with a different group if you can't get the same players to commit. We're on the second module, and at the moment, I plan to buy everything they throw at the market. It's more of an adventure, like a choose-your-own-adventure book than a game, really, though you do have dice to roll sometimes. It feels the most like a video game out of everything I've played so far.

Dead of Winter is one of my favourite games. I don't generally like the zombie theme, but this one is more about the survivors trying to survive, but also fulfil their own objectives, with a possible betrayer in the group. It always goes over well, though some people here in this sub don't like it.

The Resistance was my favourite game up until I got Deception: Murder in Hong Kong. If you can get 5 or more people together, it's going to be a good time. But I can only stand playing it about 3 times in a row because I find it high-stress and I start confusing what happened in previous games with the current one. It's also cheap, so it's worth having.

I like Roll for the Galaxy a lot, but it feels very solitaire-multiplayer. I find the theme doesn't shine through very well for me, possibly because the workers aren't meeples but dice, and my brain doesn't make the connection easily. But it's quite fun.

Cosmic Encounter is a blast, but you should aim to play it in a group of 5 or more (with expansions). My wife isn't too keen on it, because people we play with get too in-your-face... But I like it a ton. I'd play it weekly if I could. It's not Tom Vasel's #1 game for nothing!

Among the Stars I like. You note that it seems competitive. I dunno, it's definitely not a co-op game, but even Rahdo and his wife seem to like it, even with the Revival standalone/expansion in the mix, which adds more direct confrontation.

Unspeakable Words is alright. I probably wouldn't buy it myself, but I would play it again if other people wanted to. You just make words with cards, and you roll dice and possibly lose sanity. It's kinda funny when you get to make up words if you go insane, but, also gets kinda old fast. It was still enjoyable, but the group I played with (Deluxe Edition) was a little large for my liking - a lot of downtime. Base game has a more sensible limit, I think.

Elder Sign is random, yes, but I still enjoy it. I like playing it on my phone or PC though, because the physical game has a lot of parts to deal with, and I'd rather just play it on my own. Fastest way to do it is digitally.

Temple of Elemental Evil is kinda boring to me. Too much combat, not enough exploration and stuff. It's like, basically D&D lite, but not much in the way of NPCs or anything beyond lots of monsters attacking. I dunno, I was disappointed by it, both in solo and in co-op with a friend.

Legendary Encounters: Alien is a much better game than Marvel Legendary, in my opinion. I think people like Marvel more because of the theme being more palatable to a wider audience, but I didn't enjoy it. The theme is kinda absent, and the game mechanics are just boring, honestly. But Alien fixes that - scanning the rooms before knowing what is coming to attack makes a lot more sense, and the way that players can control aliens, etc. I dunno, it's just a lot better game, in my opinion. That said, I did sell it because of the annoying setup times and it isn't enjoyable solo for me. In its place for a co-op deckbuilder, I've got Attack on Titan on the way to me. It just looks more like what I am after. But if you want a Legendary game, I strongly recommend Alien over the others. There's an expansion coming out soonish, too.

I have Blue Moon Legends, but haven't played it yet.

I think that's all I can really comment on. I hope it helps a little.
There is a convention coming up in your neck of the woods you might have a look at: [Wintercon 2017](https://www.facebook.com/events/295600640809794/)

There will be lots of games on offer and you can meet other gamers in the area.

It's a bit hard to get a sense of what you *like* or *dislike* about games from the comments/mini-reviews, since you don't seem to include much in the way of details. You don't seem to like RNG much, but I'd be hard pressed to make recommendations without knowing what you *do* like.

I can tell you that Arkham Horror is going to play out a lot like Betrayal, but much longer and more fiddly. If you're not into the thematics of Lovecraft so much that you can get past the RNG, you wouldn't like it. Same with Eldritch Sign. King of New York/Tokyo play a lot like Yahtzee (but better), which is basically all RNG. Marvel Legendary is one of the worse deckbuilders I can think of when it comes to RNG- especially compared to Dominion or Thunderstone or similar games that have constant markets.

My actual recommendations on the sci-fi end are Race for the Galaxy (uses RNG, but with such a high volume of card draws, the luck tends to be pretty mitigated), or Eminent Domain, which is an excellent space deckbuilder/tableau builder, or Space Alert, which is a co-op panicky action game about a ship falling apart. I don't necessarily recommend Galaxy Trucker, but you should give it a play if you ever have the chance. Fabulous game for those who like it. You might also like Battlestar Galactica's boardgame. I've never played, but it's a hidden-role co-op game that's consistently well-praised. Cosmic Encounter is a highly regarded alien combat game that I couldn't get into, but it's short (for a game like that) and doesn't have the fiddly bits of a lot of other combat-oriented games.

On the fantasy end, there's no shortage of games to pick from, but I don't think I'd be as comfortable making suggestions there without knowing what specific game mechanics you're into.
Kingdom Builder is very easy to play, but takes a bit more insight and experience to extract all of its potential. It's an abstract with a light theme pasted on. 

You can also start by playing with objective cards that are easy to grasp such as the fisherman, miner, and the worker. It's a game she can definitely play, but it will take her a few plays to full understand it. In her defense this is the case for most people. My only knock on it is it has a theme that many kids might not be into, but you know her best. Maybe she is into feudal land grab games??!!!

If you get it, I would also get the app. It will hone your skills as you play the AI. 

Other suggestions...

**Stone Age**
**Lanterns**
**Splendor** 
**Mice and Mystics** - Great kid friendly dungeon crawler. 
**New York 1901**
**Forbidden Island/Desert**
**Kingdom Builder** is a slight set up in difficulty compared to **TtR**, as **KB** has a bit more abstract strategy to maximizing your moves on a given turn. Some of the bonus tiles and scoring systems can be a bit obtuse for a light family game as well, but in general shouldn't be too bad.

A few other gaming options are: **Thurn und Taxis**, which is similar to **TtR** but with a few variable powers. **Carcassonne** which is a nice relaxing tile-laying game with decently simple scoring. **Karuba**, which is a tile-laying with a puzzle element plus resource management. **Stone Age**, a  fairly straightforward worker-placement game.
We played KB one night with someone's little girl, and it went fine. I don't know exactly how old she was but about that age. 
My 8 year old took well to 7 Wonders Duel, Eight Minute Empire, and Castles of Mad King Ludwig. Can't give you any insight on Kingdom Builder though--he's getting it for Christmas, too!
Hello there,

As a Kingdom Builder owner and fan, there's no reason your 9-year-old kid sister shouldn't be able to handle it provided you carefully explain the THREE(3) Victory Rewards for any particular game, the points you get for building next to a Castle, the tile powers, and the adjacency rules for laying down new dwellings.

If she can mentally grasp how to strategically fill up an area so she can legally jump to another area, she'll be all set. :)

Best of all the game is short (45 min max), so even if you flub the first attempt, you can just go again!

Good luck and take care! :)
It certainly shouldn't be too complex, but I wonder if she'll enjoy it! I love Kingdom Builder, and I've taught it to a few kids in the 7-10 age range. They've all played just fine, but they didn't particularly love or hate the game. They just thought it was OK. Maybe some other people here have some kids who love KB and can chime in! Again I'm a big fan it just hasn't been a hit with kids.

You might think about **Splendor** or **Carcassonne**! I've played with kids who love those two games. Splendor because, I think it's fun to collect things and see your score accelerate as you build a big combo. And the chips are very tactile. And Carcassonne because it's fun building a map. Kids don't even care if they win they just like playing their pieces. I've only played **Takenoko** with adults, but it also seems like it would also be a hit for kids that age. The theme is cute and it's similar to Ticket To Ride where you're trying to complete secret objectives and stop your opponents.
**Chaos in the Old World** but reimagined in "The Wire" or any other similar drug dealers vs cops game. What i have in mind is, 3 different gangs fighting for terretory, 4th player is like khorne but he is the cops. Instead of killing dudes he arrests them. The gangs could be dealers of different drugs. Old World cards are going to be things like "Omar is coming" etc. I think it would be really cool
Twilight Imperium: Rex in the Dune universe ;)
Sherlock Holmes consulting detective in the Android universe... Mmmm
Still holding out for Mass Effect **Forbidden Stars** :P.
**Shadows over Camelot** in a Song of Ice and Fire setting. I imagine it as a game where, instead of Camelot, you defend Winterfell from Wildlings, the Others and the Lannisters. The various quests are easily reskinnable to fit the GoT theme as well. The hidden traitor would be a Bolton or something. 

FFG, make this game and I will throw money at you. Well, more money than I currently do. 
I don't know what game would take it, but I've always wanted to see a Smash Bros board game. But, I guess Mario Kart would work, too.
Easy one for me: **Sentinels of The Multiverse** with actual DC and/or Marvel characters.
I would like to see a d20 system for Android that doesn't have it's head stuck as far up it's own ass as Shadow Run
Couple that come to mind:

**Kingdom Death: Monster** in the Sandman universe. It's halfway there, just needs the license and some tweaks to the design. 


**Robinson Crusoe** reimagined for John Carter of Mars. This one is a stretch, but I've been really wanting someone to do a great John Carter game, and this is the closest theme that could work at first glance. 
*Nuns on the Run* in the Harry Potter universe. Students at Hogwart's evading patrolling teachers and possibly monsters.

**Tanto Cuore** in just about any other IP so that you don't look like a pervert for playing the game. I'd like to see what the game is like and not have to call my neighbors when I move into an area.
I feel **Viceroy** could work as a game about building a company/executive structure. Not sure if there's any fictional universe that matches that theme.

Most sci-fi games could be changed to match a sci-fi theme. For example replace all the races in **Forbidden Stars** with Star Trek races. **Secret Hitler** could be changed to any number of themes, including **Battlestar Galactica**, **Harry Potter** or even to match the **Dead of Winter** universe.
I'd love to see a Star Trek version of Roll For The Galaxy. I also really really want Young Justice and LOTR Dice Masters.
**Dice Masters** Star Wars
I want **Dominion** to be about a modern day cold war/arms race between rising nations.

VP cards are weapons, Provinces are Nukes. Militia would be cybercrime, moats are firewalls.  Markets/villages are trade deals and natural resources.  You could make the entire game make intuitive sense with a few hours of brainstorming.
Anything re-implemented in the **Abyss** universe. I just really like that theme.
**Fief: France 1429** should be re-done as a Game of Thrones game. It has all of the intrigue of the books/show and does the diplomacy/negotiations better than the GoT board game in half the time.
Would love to see a dungeon crawl based on the SNES game, Lufia 2.
Game of thrones is a much heavier game but I would say the main difference is making alliances. In GoT you work with your allys to mutually benifit until one back stabs the other.

This is awesome, until one of the players feels "Ganged up on" and gets mad. Sigh... it had such potential in my group.
The game is pretty intuitive; once you play a round or two it all becomes second nature. The main problem with the game is that it is full of game theory/king maker problems and faction balance issues. People are expected to play a certain way; for example, grey joy must go after stark or lannister, if they go after tyrel  (for some reason) they basically handed lannister the game. However, if they go after lannister they have a good chance at wiping out the lannister by the second or third round.
I think GoT would fit you perfectly if you don't mind the backstabbing. It is a lot heavier game than Blood Rage but I also think it's a better game.

If you're afraid of the game's length, you can make it a bit faster with the expansions (A Dance With Dragons for 6 players and A Feast For Crows for 4 players). They also change the victory point rules so I recommend playing without them too. While the game has quite a lot of different rules, it plays quite naturally after you've played a couple of rounds.

I actually bought Blood Rage when I was looking for a lightweight GoT.
To me the game is less "Dudes on a Map" and more "How many mind games can I play and friendships I can put on the edge to win… with a side of dudes on a map". 

It's not a lot like **Blood Rage** to me, bust still very fun. **Kemet** is a much better game to compare it to. Not sure if it is a step up though. 

My two cents, for what it's worth. 
I love both games. GoT hits the table once a year at best. Blood Rage is like friggin Catan. GoT is great for the collection, but if you really want a heavy game, I recommend Twilight Imperium. It does it better and is way more simple to teach, even though the rulebook is 15 pages longer. 
GoT is what got :) me back into playing board games again, but I can't really stand playing it now. Takes far too long, boring until the board is tight (usually takes a few rounds) and the winner is usually decided by someone making a mistake or because of intentional king making. 
It is streamlined very well, and the game is very tactical. The rules are also not very heavy at all. You basically just have every area you control do an action limited by the amount of tokens you have. 

Although GoT is A LOT longer than Blood Rage, and thats just because its played over 8 rounds(?), there is a bidding war, and talks about what your neighbors are gonna do, or if you're going to team up. 

I've also heard that the board game needs 6 players to be balanced, and you need the "A Feast for crows" expansion to be balanced with 4. I've only played it once as a 6-player game, and it was pretty fun, though it did go on for a bit too long imo
We played this at work quite a few times until we finally realized we hated the game and put a ban on it ever being played again LMAO

This game is VERY uneven and not unfair to certain factions. It relies heavily on making alliances that will then be broken. I think the biggest thing we hated about it was the game board (map) which there's really nothing they can do about that.

You either gang up and take someone out early (thus pissing them off) or you all go out for yourselves and then certain people will automatically lose pretty fast.
I know a lot about research on the benefits of video games, but not so much about board games. These guys have been doing research on board games for quite a while now, so maybe you'll find something useful there: http://www.tiltfactor.org/research/.
Jane McGonigle's book Superbetter is an interesting study of the mental (and sometimes physical) benefits of all types of games. I haven't read it in its entirety, but what I've seen is pretty great. It's sort if a memoir with scientific backing and interesting chapter "objectives" to complete.
Xwing is an amazing 1v1 experience and something that my brother and I love to play. Building a list, planning out a strategy (which rarely works out) and the pure joy of 'flying' is just an amazingly fun time. 

It is a rabbit hole of buying all the new ships, sometimes multiple copies and finding a solid storage system but I feel it is totally worth it. The tactical feel and look of this game is top notch. 

Destiny is a completely different game with a different model. You'll buy a core and then buy packs with random dice and cards in them. This is reason alone to never buy it in my opinion. I just can't see myself spending $20-40 a shot to hopefully find the pieces I want and then end up with duplicates of things already owned. No thank you. 

Ultimately but what is most exciting for you and your other player. My brother and I have never played anyone but each other with xwing and we love it. The money is a real thing here and you will spend it but you will also know exactly what you're gonna get. 

Happy gaming!
I own at least one of each X-Wing ship for Rebel and Imperial factions (I don't own any Scum ships). I find that I do well making squads with these, but storage and keeping track of all the components needed to play is a bit of a nuisance sometimes. I love the game though! I make sure to get the new ships when they're released, even if I don't have time to play. I know they will come in handy when I do end up playing again. Plus, they're pretty cool to collect.

I played in 3 pre-release events for Star Wars Destiny and I love it! The only things you really have to worry about as far as the nuisance factor is the dice and tokens. However, those are much easier to carry around than X-Wing components.

Also, I bought a total of 2 of each starter and about 30 boosters. I was able to make two competitive decks out of everything I bought. I even ended up pulling a Legendary Vader, which was a HUGE bonus. Obviously, I'm missing quite a few cards to complete a collection, but all-in-all, I have a winning record with the cards I have.

Most importantly, the game is insanely fun! My wife isn't into gaming much, but she actually asks if we can play. Same thing with my 8-year old daughter. It's easy enough for her to play, even if she doesn't really get what some of the cards do. She just loves rolling dice and building up her characters with upgrades. The game is fast-paced once you get into it, and there's enough strategy to keep you on your toes.

I would definitely recommend Destiny over X-Wing, but I still hold X-Wing in very high regard.
I would suggest Destiny even though i don't play it. X wing is meant to be played in local groups. So unless you have local play. You might not play x wing as much as you would like. Also x wing is as much about the flying then it is the dice. X wing is more table top war gaming then a dice game. Destiny is designed as a dice game. Also x wing can get pretty pricey to get what you want.
The best answer is probably to get some sort of intro pack for both games and see which one you like better. Two starter decks for Destiny is $30 MSRP, while two X-wing core sets (trust me, you want two at least) is $80 MSRP (but can easily be found online for $40-60). If you were planning to dive into either of these two games I'm going to assume you were will to spend at least a hunded or two into buying stuff, so an initial investment of about $70-90 get a taste of both should be reasonable. Heck, you might end up liking both.

If you had to choose only one, I would suggest X-wing (haven't tried Destiny). I think the feeling of flying a Star Wars ship really comes to life in X-wing, which is an experience you can't really get in most other games. Plus the game is very easy to learn and easy to play.

Forgive my ignorance, but Destiny is just another card game among many, many others (including a Star Wars LCG, which is also made by Fantasy Flight). The game also follows the booster pack model, no? Personally thats a big con for me, but some people enjoy opening boosters. Finally, it is a card (and dice!) game so I think its safe to assume luck will play a bigger role in outcomes over a game like x-wing.
Both games are excellent choices, and it's hard for you to go wrong.

Destiny is a collectible card/dice game where you build your character list and customize your deck. It's much faster to set up and start playing than X-Wing, but most of the content is distributed at random. You can expect to buy at least 12 booster packs before you have a diverse enough collection to start messing around with your starter decks (assuming you buy both the Rey and Kylo Ren starters). Dice are much more central to Destiny than X-Wing, but cards and deck building are also a thing.

X-Wing is a miniatures game based on positioning, intuition, and daring. Both players get a fleet of ships and work to outfly the other. Setup is relatively fast for a miniatures game, but still a good 10 minutes longer than you'd take for Destiny. The community for X-Wing is incredibly robust and it shouldn't be hard for you to find players, and since the expansions are static it is much easier for you to find the exact ships and upgrades you want to expand your game. Cards are a factor, but less so than with Destiny - you get 100 points to spend on various pilots and upgrades (represented by cards), and the damage deck is randomized via card draw.

It's worth noting that Destiny is structured to use a much broader cross-section of the Star Wars universe (tapping into all three trilogies, while X-Wing is almost exclusive to the Original Trilogy era), but since it's a newer game, it has far less content than X-Wing does right now. You can have General Grievous fight alongside Kylo Ren on board the Death Star, but if you want to bring Darth Maul into the mix you're out of luck for now.
I've never played X-wing, but i'm not going to get into a CCG. I hate rolling the dice (metaphorically, I love rolling dice literally) and getting the same unneeded garbage over and over again. X-Wing can be a rabbit hole, but if you plan ahead you can pretty easily buy the core game and a few expansions for a reasonable sum and have a ton of fun with it. There are cards in the game, but not so much for playing in the traditional sense; they indicate player stats and weapon upgrades. You're never holding a hand of cards. It's mostly a dice rolling battle game with tactical maneuvering.
Both. You need both. Spend $120 for 10 X-Wing ships on Mini Mart or CoolStuff. Pick up the Destiny beginner decks from your FLGS. 
Blood Bowl Team Manager is a lot of fun! Not so much nitty gritty play-by-play, but more playing the highlights of the season.
I can only speak for Blood Bowl. Both BB and BB:Team Manager(Card game) are both strategy based but rely a lot on luck and dice rolls. You have to enjoy the wackiness and chaos provided by dice rolling if you are going to appreciate BB. You should be more likely to find local people to play BB with than any of it's competitors(Dread/Kaos/Guild ball) but you may want to check with your local stores to see what is supported most. I would check to see if Dread & Kaos are still alive if that matters to you, I don't know if these games are still being fully supported/produced. Guild Ball has a 2nd edition coming out in the near future so you may want to hold off on that.
>Probably will not participate in structured League Play

That's more or less the whole point of Blood Bowl. I'd say go with Guildball, as the thing I hate the most about it (it's nearly on rails overarching progression) does actually make it good for a smaller group to play it at their leisure. Blood Bowl does have rules out there for more simple one off matches with stronger teams, but actually picking effective teams and skills is a daunting task.

That said unlike the other sports based games, you can always give blood bowl a whirl for free thanks to it being massive enough for online implimentations to exist, such as the retail game on Steam, or the java based free [FUMBBL](https://fumbbl.com/~Silent_Hastati)

That said, I will downplay the role of dice in BB. While it's true a utter dicing can bollocks a game, a good player will still win 9/10 times because the dice really make it a game about risk management. You want to put your opponent in a position where he NEEDS to roll a bunch of perfect rolls in order to come at you, while making sure your rolls are either non-existant, or as easy as possible. Ironically the people who decry the Turnover rule of Blood Bowl don't realize it is precisely that rule that keeps it from degenerating into a roll all the dice all the time type game. Screwing up hurts, and it hurts a lot, but with some smarts, you can usually avoid it.

Unless you pick an Ogre team. Then the dice will hate you but you deserve it for making a decision as dumb as picking the team full of Ogres. (To clarify, Ogres, Goblins, and Halflings are considered the 3 utter joke teams that only exist for a laugh or experienced vs noob handicap, and Ogres are considered by far to be the worst of the three.)

All that said though, the actual cost of GW miniatures is so fucking high that I can't imagine playing it tabletop these days tbh, and as such would steer you to aformentioned digital adaptions. Unless you're willing to kitbash some fake models out of cardstock and some bottlecaps, actually getting a BB group going from scratch for several players is a ridiculous amount of money, even if you're using 3rd party "fantasy football wink wink nudge nudge" models instead of Blood Bowl ones.

Lastly, this is as good a place to ask as any I suppose, does anyone know what ever happened with that pro wrestling boardgame from a few years back. Did it ever achieve it's kickstarter or make production or anything? I can't find any info it even existed so maybe I just imagined it???
Dreadball is probably the better grid based sports strategy game, the game play was certainly much better than old Blood Bowl and I don't think they've made huge changes.

I've just picked up the Guild Ball Kick Off! set but haven't had a chance to play yet (Friday!). With free form movement I'm hoping for a much more tactical experience.
It's a living card game so it's meant to be a continuous investment of money and time. It is not something meant to be picked up now and then, but to constantly play over the course of a campaign and buy the regularly (monthly) released content.
did you ever consider eldritch horror? 
Played one game of the arkham lcg and like it a lot. The lore, cards, and mechanics are designed well and bring a great unsettling theme. The chaos tokens used for skill checks is smart allowing you to tailor the risk in the game to what you want. A shame there was no bag included for the chaos tokens. 

The game is going to be a lot deeper due to the nature of card interactions, but the rule set is straight forward enough. I'm looking forward to campaign play. 
Will the future expansions increase the player to 3 or 4 or will I always need two core sets?
I think the principale thing to consider is to have defuse light. That way it will prevent glare.
Yes, diffused Daylight or Bright White is best for boardgaming. I'm a bit turned off by Daylight balanced bulbs, to be honest, so I use Bright White in my space. Warm or Soft White is typical for Translucent bulb colour temperature... and that's a bit too orange for gaming. 

This is especially true if you try and take photos of your games or your gaming sessions. You'll get much nicer results under Bright or Daylight bulbs. It also helps when you need to distinguish between pieces that were inadvertently coloured a bit too close together. 
If you can, have brighter lighting over the table than anywhere else. Some sort of hanging lamp directly over the table with shades on it so it doesn't shine into anyone's eyes is good. Think lighting for a pool table or a poker game.
I prefer softer lighting all round the room, but a clear light thats bright enough to see everything on the table. Id love to implement something like the light from a snooker table but its not possible for me.
I haven't played it yet, but there are couple of videos detailing it on youtube; a [playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyYbAnLd5hgZj5113RPCl_kuHJ77-ksRT) and a [rules overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKW2bq5Y7oI). Could to give you a bit of a clearer picture.

I always feel that Phil's games are interesting distillations of real phenomena first, and balanced games second. One needs to also be interested in the stories the games tell, although play can also be interestingly competitive at times (and brokenly unbalanced at others).
Played it a couple times cooperatively ands look forward to playing it solo.

Like all of Phil Eklund's designs, he chooses to use thematic terms rather than descriptions of the game mechanics - and that makes for a dense read.  Also,  he splits up rules between the main body and glossary (which I really don't like).

So the game in a nutshell: you have 2 (cooperative) or 3 (competitive) dome pieces.   Until you get an organism with green does or cubes,  you get only 1 dome to use.

You wait for an event card to bring out a location card, then you put you dome on it and maybe disks.  You roll dice based on domes and cubes on the top banner, and if by yourself on a banner of your color you can reroll.  The rolls determine in cubes move from the bottom to the top, top to the bottom (which gets you disks), if disks get removed from the card, and if your dome comes off (and gives you a disk).  Best of all,  if 2 dice match then you take the domes and cubes from the top banner, discard everything else, flip the card and put it in your tableau, and add the bits you took on the right spot.

Now your goal is to buy cards that make your big card better.  They will add cubes of different colors, but some opponent cats can attach and take those cubes (plus but cards of their own) - and one they have their own enhancer cards another card can attach to them!  Why do you want cubes? With enough you can buy a card to lay over your big card... and the first guy attached to you becomes part of you and the other guy attached to him becomes attached to you now.  You can either but a blue creature card, add cubes to it until filled up, then flip the card *or* go straight to the flip side.

I've skipped over a lot of little details.  Things like some cards bought cause "spikes" and your green bits protect you from that; that your first stage of life makes rolls where you could lose cubes, but yellow allows dice rerolls and blue blocks cube removal; that added cards have tons of cool abilities; that disks can be added to your tableau cards to protect them;  that event cards have tons of symbols that trigger dice rolls;  and so on.

My point is that it isn't really that hard of a game... maybe I should start writing "...In Plain English" guides for his rulebooks to help people learn the mechanics instead of the thematics, but I Will say the appeal of Sierra Madre Games are the heavy science/history themes.

Overall, I think this is a solid cooperative game and in the category of Neanderthal.  I can't wait to do a "grand run" of Bios Genesis to Bios Megafauna to Origins: How We Became Human... then follow it up with a game of High Frontier with Interstellar - essentially playing the dawn of life in our system to a hypothetical future when life leaves Sol to spread to other stars.  However, it is not a game for everyone and didn't get widely discussed in general gaming forums (SMG title fans are grognard-like and this akin to wargamers more than boardgamers.
I just got the game.
I dont have a Biology background. I'm a system engineer.
I've look a videos online and it seems to be the most complicated game that I own for now. And I have some complicated game ie: Mage knight, Forbidden stars.

I will have to sit and read the whole thing multiple time. I cant wait to try it though.

Hopefully it will be entertaining and instructive!
The manual makes it more complicated than it is, I think.  The nomenclature (and the fact that your bits have different names depending on where they are on the playfield) is pretty difficult to parse at times.

This is (really!) a game where you can just do things that you're able to do, and figure out why those are good or bad later.  I've had more success in learning the rules by doing that than trying to parse the rulebook.

I may just work on a good player aid that lays out what you do at each stage, and what all the icons allow you to do and when.  
Disregard me, I'm not sure what game I was thinking of but it's not this one
Got my copy, haven't got to play it yet. Manual is another Eklund special.

You only need three words, my friend:

**Mice and Mystics**
I'm not sure if you're looking for a miniature game or a board game with miniatures but I think Guild Ball could work for you and your kids. The Kick Off! 2-player starter set has really good value for the price and the rules aren't that difficult to learn so your kids should be fine if you're playing with them. You obviously need to help them until they learn the rules but I think it's the same for pretty much every miniature based games.

It has some violence but nothing too serious and the presentation of female characters isn't sexist (if that matters when you're playing with your kids). In the end, it's about soccer, so fighting isn't even necessary for winning the game.

Another option could be Imperial Assault which has campaign play and skirmish battles in the same box. It's a bit heavier than Mice and Mystics (which chainmailtank suggested) but it is a lot better game and you'll get the skirmish battles and more miniatures to paint.
That [Star Wars X-Wing](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing/) space ships game looks good. You can even personalize your "team" with commanders and stuff, your kids would probably like that, too. The base game isn't that expensive, either.


**Mechs vs Minions**!
**Arcadia quest** might be a good one for you. Very cute 'chibi' art style, straightforward rules with lots of dice throwing. Miniatures are beautiful, and fun to paint. It's a PvPvE game, if you're okay with that.

I just discovered Suzanne's content in the Dice Tower network and I'm digging her style of review and summary.
Fields Of Arle and Caylus? Good picks, Suz! 
Love seeing La Granja on here. One of my favorites. 
I'm kind of surprised not to see Race for the Galaxy on there at all. As someone who loves San Juan and likes Roll, I think Race is one of the best games ever made. Different strokes I guess. 

I do really like the variety and bold choices in her list overall. 
EDH brought me back to magic too.

It eventually reached the same result as most arms races. Nuclear level with everyone broke and miserable.
Loved this list. I love how Suzanne talks about games.

I also enjoyed how unique it was.

My biggest question: Did she exclude all basic 52 card games besides Pinochle, or was Hearts or Spades not in the top 50?

Also, I think her comments about Magic: The Gathering are very important - it's such a huge game that if you find the community/playstyle that is to your liking, it elevates the game to another level.
What is "Magic: The Gathering (EDH, casual style)"? Is it normal commander?
Great top 50...looking forward to the top 50 board game apps list 
I'm excited to see **Glass Road** getting the love it deserves. It's a favourite in one of my local groups, I'm the one who owns it, and it's truly a privilege. Definitely my #1 of all time.

Also, props for choosing **Castellion** as the Oniverse selection - it's the best of the lot by several miles, but I've had to watch Zee turn everyone onto the inferior Onirim instead...

In general, Suzanne matches my taste - namely, euros, the obscure, and the semi-casual. (**Blueprints** and **Longhorn**, for example, are both of those last two categories, and until she listed them I figured I was the only fan of either.)

(Or maybe, with those classic games in there too, she's an amalgam of me and my boyfriend...)
I've played maybe 3 of these. Keeping this list for the next time I go to my local tabletop bar.
Given the love for Fields of Arle and Patchwork, I wonder if Suzanne has tried A Feast for Odin yet.
Nice to see a list that doesn't stick to the Dice Tower standard formula. 
Pinochle?! I didn't realize anyone else played. That was one of the first strategy games I learned (by watching my parents play).
Great list. So many picks that I like but wouldn't necessarily make my list. 

Fun to get a new perspective makes me want to try games I may not have given enough respect to.
ARLEDROOL
Really enjoyed these lists.  Hope to see more of Suzanne's content in the future.
Why doesn't Revolution get on any lists?? I think that game is incredible.
While it is great to support a local business, they have to do their part. Yes they need a larger profit margin, and will need to be more expensive but they also need to find other ways to add value to the shopping experience. Is buying from them a worthwhile and fun experience? Do they bring enough to the table?

It's a harsh world in retail with Amazon taking everyone's lunch money. Not every small or local business deserves to survive.
My local game store is the only one in the city, and I will buy from them occasionally. It all depends. If the price difference is minimal, or the game is small box, then I don't mind paying a bit more. For example, 18e for Codenames in my LGS vs 15e from Amazon.co.uk. 

But for bigger games I'd be more discerning. 100e for Blood Rage in store vs 80e online? I'm getting it online. No if's or but's. I don't play in the store, I don't use their space for anything, I just go there to look at games. I do think it's important to support the store, as it is helpful for the community, but not enough to add 20% onto an already expensive game. 

Also, my local store never has sales. They have a clearance corner, but I've never seen anything worthwhile (for me) in it. If something is on sale on Amazon, then that's where I'm going to get it.

Basically, I have a tolerance level, depending on how much of a difference the price is. If the difference is outside that tolerance level, I buy it online.
My FLGS Board Game Barrister not only charges more than online, but also more than the MSRP. Yes, if you're a member you get "points" that eventually amount to a discount, but it still doesn't balance out to MSRP. You also have to use these points if you want to try out their games in the back. I would love to support my local store but their business model is horrible and not customer friendly.
Same. They also forgot the "friendly" bit.
Don't buy games then? If you use the site though, feel free to buy drinks/snacks/dice/counters/etc. 
I support The Guardtower in Columbus because they have a wide selection, a customer loyalty program, and have been singularly the most LGBT friendly place I've been without making any kind of fuss over it. I support them enough that I generally include their name whenever I post about them. I don't really support my local store because it's a MtG/Wargaming store. They have really competitive prices for those, but a really weak selection (as they should, seeing as they're mostly unprofitable) of boxed games that are mostly things I already own.
It's kinda bad here in Helsinki at the moment. It's probably down to the fact that the only EU nation that Finland shares a land border with is Sweden, and that border is way up near the Arctic circle (Norway isn't EU technically, but its border is also even further north). So realistically if stuff is going to be shipped to Helsinki it's either by plane or boat instead of road/rail.

There's three options close enough to the city centre to go to a game store and pick up board games:

* Lautapelit. Actually a publisher (Eclipse) and the official distributor of FFG games in Finland, but they have physical stores too. The prime selling point for Lautapelit is their extensive Finnish-language catalogue of board games. Takes up half the store. The other half has the English language varieties. The markup compared to what I'd expect online is minimal. But their English language stock is usually incomplete (I'm Australian and work with many foreigners, so English versions are far more preferable for me).

* Fantasiapelit. They're a more general nerd culture store, with an extensive manga selection as well as tabletop wargaming. But their pricing has gone... wrong lately. When I first started going there, the prices were quite reasonable. But they seem to have a 15% markup minimum on board games these days. Pandemic: Legacy sells for €91.50 at the moment. Every other store I'm mentioning sells it for no more than €70. I prefer window shopping in this store thanks to the range. But that mark up, well, it makes it harder to justify buying from there. Even with their "You spent €240 on overpriced stock so have €20 off a purchase" card reward system. They just recently bumped Netrunner datapacks from €16.50 to €18 as well, which is chump change to be sure but doesn't make me think good things about price increases (and Lautapelit don't keep up to date on LCGs in-store so I can't price compare that way).

* Poromagia. They're out of the city centre (one train stop, or the end of one of the tram lines). The prices are the best in the city, and the stock is usually not to shabby either. But I try to avoid them. People I know that are heavily invested in the board game/LARP/RPG/etc community around here tell some interesting stories about how they don't play nice with other board game stores in Finland. Out of respect for the scene (that I don't even take part in), I prefer to take my money elsewhere.

Amazon.de has also recently made shipping prices more reasonable. I just checked Pandemic: Legacy and I can get it shipped here for €62.50 with an expected shipping time of 5-8 days.

I've not actually ordered a board game off Amazon ever. I preordered Scythe: Invaders from Afar on Board Game Extras but that's about it. The €5 mark up, I can certainly live with for big board games from the local store. But I'm not too pleased with the more egregious markups.
Where do you play the game? If at home, feel free to find your games online. If at the store with the regulars or your friends... or that's how you met the people that you play games with - then I would strongly suggest supporting the store.

Yes, full retail pricing sucks sometimes. But being the retailer who gets constantly undercut by online retailers sometimes sucks more. They simply cannot afford to offer the discounts that Amazon does - ever.
My LGS (black knight games) is really bad too. Pandemic is $60, pandemic legacy is $92. Caverna, $130.


I order from another game shop (401 games) that's about 45 mins away that has better prices, and is still a game shop that holds events.
I try to support my local store but their games are 30+ euros more expensive than online stores and their sleeves are always out of stock. I even tried waiting for their sleeves to come on stock and made a combined order of 1000 sleeves but they never fulfilled it anyway. I just occasionally buy some paints there but that's it. 
If you use your FLGS as the place to play board games, meet up with friends, and generally hang out then you should support them by paying for their "overpriced" games. Because then you aren't just paying for games, you're paying for a hang out spot. You're paying for the convenience of not having to have a house with a dedicated gaming area. 

But if you (or a friend) hosts your own game nights then, by all means, go to Amazon and save money so you can buy MORE games!
**Galaxy Trucker** for 85 american dollars plus tax.

So yeah.  It's less of a store and more of a clubhouse.
I just don't see the reason for existence for many FLGS anymore. 

Prices are super expensive and the offer is always out of date, expensive, wrong language whatever. 

Many of them are better off as a boardgame cafe I think, scrap lots of the inventory and provide better place for sitting down to game. Sure have some common stuff in stock like the latest magic sets, some party games and popular gateway titles that you sell to people just coming in. But at some FLGS I see 2/3rd of the space used for gamers games like game of thrones, BSG and the like and I just wonder why. Prices on them are worse than online, people don't randomly buy these when coming into the store and they often even scare away non-gamers. 
My local FLGS sells for MSRP, so not much is bought there.

The one place where they shine greatly though is things that are out of print. I have picked up Gears of War for $70 (and they still have a copy), Viticulture EE which is OOS on the online sites I check and Snowdonia which is also OOS online. 

Maybe the general games are too much but there may be a diamond hiding there as well.
Are they selling higher than MSRP? I wouldn't ever buy a game priced like that unless it was out of print or for a charity auction or something.

If they're selling *at* MSRP, that's completely normal. Amazon routinely charges 25-50% less than MSRP, so you can get some big discrepancies on high-priced games. For instance, Forbidden Stars is $100 (standard retail price) at my LGS but $75 on Amazon.

Ultimately you have to have a reason for buying from the store instead of online; they're not a charity. Do you often go there to play games or tournaments for games? Do they provide a service that you want to support?
Guess I'm lucky. The prices at my FLGS (which doubles as a toy store) are often comparable to online prices. On top of that, if you have a customer card, you get a 10% discount on all gaming related purchases. I've rarely, if ever, paid more than what I would pay online. Even if the price was slightly higher than what I'd pay online, I'd still prefer to buy at the game store to show my support.

In your situation, with prices being drastically different, I would approach the owner/manager of the store and talk to them about it. Tell them that you'd gladly support the store if prices weren't so high compared to online.
Ever since the FLGS here stopped organizing events I bought a lot less games there.

Although some of the people working there are great, they became "just another store".
Thankfully my primary FLGS usually sports the best prices I can get in Ontario, Canada.
Yup, it sucks.

I want to support them but dang, I ain't rich.

It's to the point where they won't even help me buy miniature painting supplies unless I'm buying it at the store.
My reason are not the prices but the fact that new games take soooo long to hit their shelves
If I spend a day at my local store playing, I'll buy drinks there, and make sure to pick up at least a small book or game. I just consider it part of the price to keep they place operating.

I still buy stuff online as well.
Think of it as paying rent instead of "markup". If you use their space and time, pay the rent. 

You can choose where to buy your stuff still, but realize that paying employees, keeping the lights on and stuff like that costs them money. Also realize that buying a bag of chips and a soda every time you go in doesn't "pay the rent" - $5 for 2+ hours of sitting there is very minimal. 

Have you tried talking to them about it in a nice non-confrontational way that doesn't sound like you're trying to get a giant discount? A lot of times, they are all too aware, but my store does a % off if you special order from them. They CANNOT match Amazon in this respect still, but they'll give you something to buy it from them. They'll also do something like Team Convenants subscription service to LCGs, so they don't have product lingering on the shelf taking up valuable other space.

As some other posters said, they have to do their part too - but if you use it as a gathering or play space, do yours also. 
It's a common problem.  Most things are cheaper online these days, because they're sold by huge companies who can buy tons of copies at wholesale prices and turn them around at a lower margin just due to the sheer volume of sales.

Don't let people guilt you into shopping local if you don't feel the conviction yourself.  There are some folks who blindly advocate for the local option, but I don't think that's fair to the businesses or the consumer.  If my local store overprices everything and treats me poorly, I'm expected to take my business elsewhere.

Do consider the value of what you get from your local store *apart* from merely the price of the inventory, though.  It costs me more to get games locally nearly 100% of the time.  However, I really value the ability to go to the store and browse shelves of cool stuff.  If everybody shopped online, brick and mortar stores wouldn't exist, so I buy 75% of my games in-store just to keep real-life shopping for games intact.  That may not be important to you, but it is to me.  Also consider how much you value their service, play tables (if applicable), etc.  Whatever you get out of the store: hold it up against the lower Amazon price and ask yourself which is more important to you.

If all you value is a low price (and there's nothing wrong with that), you can't argue with online sales.
As others have mentioned in this thread, you are under no obligation to support local game stores that do nothing to actually support you as a consumer. Obviously it's your money and you can do what you want, but if your brick and mortar game store has essentially double the price of online retailers, I would recommend just buying online. Business and maximizing your dollar value always comes first.
Yeah this comes up a lot in the Magic: The Gathering community and board games. 

Currently in many US stores, I think very few (though I will be corrected, I'm sure) in my area in MA make money via board gaming alone. In fact, I'd venture that Magic and other CCG / LCGs make them a lot more money than board games. 

While I love my LGS and do buy cards there, I will draw the line somewhere and that line is often with board games. Many LGSs sell at or above MSRP where I am. 

I asked the co-shopowner once and he claimed that (for example) the order was so small and that they charged shipping, etc, that the price for a particular Sentinels of the Multiverse expansion had to be almost $15 US ABOVE MSRP. That's absurd. I told him honestly it was too much. 

At any rate, the biggest vote you make is with your wallet. I buy MtG cards from my LGS because even though the prices are slightly higher than if I went online (we're talking by $2-3 on $15-$20 cards), I do value that they run tournaments and actually support that community. 

I do not think they add value to the board gaming community because they don't promote it or provide as much support. We had more support from the mall food court when we used to play board games there than the LGS. That's kind of sad when you think about it. I was sadder when that food court closed down than I would have been for almost any store I played board games at in the context of board gaming... 

Edit:

So the problem I think is that in the end, there's little to no support for many board gaming groups and since they're generally preying on immediacy, there's little reason to compete if few board gamers are coming in. People even buy X-Wing and Warmachine miniatures at the LGSs I go to even though online does have it for cheaper in large part because of the community and they like going to the LGS. 
Same boat. Our FLGS/club sells Betrayal at House on the Hill, but it's more expensive by a whole daily wage's worth of money than getting a new one from eBay with shipping, so I'm reluctant to buy it at all because I don't want to have to explain it to the store owner.
I wasn't a fan of the special scenario either, but I like Raxxon added to the standard scenarios. The mutant zombies mix things up.
I have also only played with the module once, but my experience was very different.  We locked down Raxxon early on and never let a single special zombie escape.  We also raided that item deck and got all sorts of crazy powerful stuff.  It was good times.
[deleted]
I don't think the pre-cooked scenarios are that great.

From a Raxxon perspective, unless the game is long, I'm not sure locking Raxxon is worth it. It's really expensive to do.  2 specific dice, and a character has to be there. 
To me, the epitome of "create your own adventure" is [Tales of the Arabian Nights](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34119/tales-arabian-nights), the entire game is a story unfolding as you travel around and make decisions. Very fun for a group, although it isn't co-op so I'm not sure if fits your working together to solve a problem request. Even though it is technically competitive, to me the game plays more or less cooperatively still, b/c of the sharing of stories.
Could try one of the escape room board games. If want to do teams, could buy 2 copies and race?


Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is among the best cooperative games out there.  it's not as much a "create your own adventure" but it's a very robust team game.
Try some sort of one-shot RPG like **Dread**. You would need to moderate the game for the other guests.
If you're at all into role playing, you could probably turn Avalon into a game for the evening. Make stories depending on the results of the cards that come up. 

Poor example off the top of my head (Excuse the grammar, lol):

Narrator: King Arthur summoned one representative from each of his major kingdoms in search of the holy grail, but his arch-nemesis Mordred got some of his minions into the mix. 

His right hand man Merlin (Who is in disguise), is able to see the true intentions of each of the representatives, but cannot reveal who they are to Arthur in fear of being killed by the minions of Mordred is present at the round table.

**Blah blah blah introduce all of the special characters

To decide whether or not the round table is trust worthy, King Arthur has set 5 quests for the representatives to go on. Should they pass 3 of the 5, without Merlin revealing himself, the round table succeeds and can go on to find the holy grail. 

The first quest requires 2 representatives to go find a ruby from the mountains in the north.

Mark: I am best suited for this quest! I'm from the mountains in the north, and know them like the back of my hand!

Alice: I am also suited for this! I am a geologist and know exactly where the ruby's are most likely to be! 

etc etc.

If the quest fails:

Mark: I saw with my own eyes that Alice destroyed the ruby's whenever we found one!

Alice: No! Mark got us lost and took us for a round about the mountains! We never even got to see a single ruby!

etc etc. 
A couple quick suggestions

**Betrayal at House on the Hill**

**The Resistance**

**Pandemic**

**Forbidden Desert**

/u/r2d8 getinfo
**Two Rooms and a Boom** was practically designed for mingling over drinks.

Not my favorite game, but it gets people talking one-on-one or in small groups- and forces interaction in a more constructive way than similar games like **resistance**. You can slow down the timer to allow more out-of-game mingling if that works for your group.
Twilight Struggle.
You need **Tash-Kalar**.
I highly recommend that you look at these, especially since you like TI:  
**Polis: Fight for the Hegemony**  
**Wir sind das Volk**  
**Sekigahara**  


Maybe **Combat Commander:Europe**, if you would want to try a wargame

Also, keep an eye out for the upcoming releases/kickstarters of:  
**Colonial Twilight**  
**Hannibal:Rome vs Carthage**  
**Imperial Struggle**
If you want some smaller two player games: Samurai is a super tight two player game. Patchwork is great. Mr Jack can get really interesting. These games are at the most 30 minute games.... but they are all really tight and you can have some great competition playing them. Also something like Eclipse can be enjoyed as a two player and is great if others show up.
[Battlecon: Devastation of Indines](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1125631/old-masters-grizzled-veterans-and-spunky-fresh-tal) is a great two-player game that brings old 2D fighters to the table, and does so really well. This is a game that rewards two players being willing to dive into it together. Devastation comes with 30 vastly different fighters of varying complexities for you to get lost in. If you really get into it there is a lot of depth there.

[Star Wars: Imperial Assault](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1523604/broken-meeple-s-not-how-force-works-star-wars-impe) has a 1v1 Skirmish mode that is really intriguing. It really rewards having as much of the game as possible, but there's a decent amount of variation with just the core game. I disagree with the reviewer about campaign mode, as I find a lot of enjoyment with it (I'm currently playing two campaigns on BGG currently).

[Twilight Struggle](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/471953/rogers-reviews-deluxe-twilight-struggle-comprehens) is heralded as one of the best two player games, and is another game that rewards two players willing to learn it together. I've never played it, but would like to one day. 

[Android: Netrunner](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/876792/balanced-review-androidnetrunner) is a great asymmetrical 2-player game that, like Imperial Assault, can be a bit of money-hole. You can get a decent value out of one core set (especially if found at a discounted price, like I found it), but you'll definitely want better cards if you want to build better decks. But the core set comes with 4 corporation and 3 runner starter decks, which should be enough to decide whether you like it or not.

The reviews linked here are largely positive, and there are definitely dissenting opinions on all of these games somewhere. Definitely research them more (with your friend  if able) before deciding to purchase anything.

Happy gaming!
Le Havre, Fields of Arle, and Twilight Struggle might be good ones to check out.
Here's some shorter play time suggestions:

**Race for the Galaxy** is a great at two player and higher counts. 

**Battle Line** is a very clever 2 player.

**Android: Netrunner** has been previously mentioned. It's a very deep game deck building.

Star Wars Rebellion very good two person game of war and hide and seek. 
Queen Games has a sale going on Amazon currently but yes, the sales are few and far between. Black Friday and Cyber Monday hype has superseded the actual deals.
B&N has had some deals. BF until yesterday, they had board games Buy 1 Get 1 half off that in-store you could combine with a 30% off one item, which basically amounted to 40% off any two games you could find on their shelves. Today they have 15% off everything + 30% off one game which is, again, essentially 40% off any one game. (B&N typically starts with prices above OLGS/Amazon, so this is more like 30% off in both cases, but still)

Black Friday, I got Kingdom Builder for $5 by combining a Discover card deal with Amazon's Queen games sale.

So yeah, there have been deals out there. Especially if you count the B2G1 deals Amazon and Target ran before Black Friday. It hasn't been spectacular or overwhelming, but there have been deals.
The Buy 2, Get 1 Free deals from a month ago on Amazon were a bit more impressive, but there are still some good deals to be found.  We're still optimistic that more deals will peak their heads out.  

Trying to keep track of them here:

That's good to know!  

Honestly, this time of year, it was probably just easier and cheaper to just send them off without documentation.  For 3 pawns, it keeps the customer happy and costs them cents.  
I've contacted several companies about missing or damaged components and never been asked for documentation. But Mayfair isn't one of them, so it's good to know they treat customers right, too.
Betrayal at House on the Hill - the first half of the game is pointless, just going through empty motions.
Exploding kittens 
Evolution. Just bored out of my mind 
Plenty, recently, it was Clash of Cultures. Too long and not that interesting.
**Ra The Dice Game** for me. I was bored out of my skull for most of the game.
**Mythe**. The gimmick wore off quickly, and there was still a lot of game time left. There aren't many games I'm unwilling to play again. Mythe is one of the closest.
**La Isla**. I don't know why, but I really didn't enjoy it.
Oh man, yeah. We didn't even finish a round of Dead Last. Aside from that I'm really bad at remembering the games I don't like.
Quite a few. I'll just list four or five here. It's kind of a bad habit, because I *know* you can't get a proper appreciation for the nuances of a game with only a single play. However, the ones I've discounted were games that I played, and then came to the realization that even if it had subtle nuances from game to game, it still wouldn't be a game I'd be interested in. 

* **Alchemists** - while I enjoyed the puzzle of deduction using the app and the cross-reference chart, the worker placement portion of the game kind of bored me, and since that's a big portion of the game, I decided to let Alchemists go in a trade. I absolutely think it's a game worth trying, but once was enough of an experience for me.
* **Imperial Settlers** - not a bad game, but it's a little too combative for my taste. I don't mind interactivity in games, but I prefer when it's less destructive. I played it once with my wife, and decided it wasn't for me.
* **Cacao** - it's a clever game, but I wasn't engaged with the puzzle. Essentially, it's a multiplier puzzle. Where and how do I position this tile to maximize what I need? What frustrated me about it was that I wanted more... more variety and more challenge. I don't think that would make for a popular game, but it would make for a game that I prefer. Cacao wasn't bad, but it wasn't enough for me.
* **Dead Of Winter** - as a fan of zombies (yes, I said it), I had been looking for a game that seemed to take a more euro approach to the genre. Dead Of Winter seemed to have some euro sensibilities... and it does! The problem is, they're overshadowed by an Ameritrash sensibility that I didn't care for - a highly deterministic die that can basically "reset" your game every turn, if you aren't careful. Wasn't creating fuzzy feelings.
* **Dominion** - Well, not really. I've actually played maybe a dozen games of Dominion, but none of them were ever as good as that first one, with the base set. Beyond that, the novelty of the game kind of diminished, and I was never satisfied with subsequent plays of it, despite owning a couple of the expansions. I traded it all away.

**Man Bites Dog** - A game where you have to make a news headline from a hand of cards. The distribution of points on the cards seems completely random (with the "Wall St" card scoring 0 points for some reason). Everyone who has made a sentence that makes some sense scores points! This game just bores me to death.
**Tragedy Looper** - Had a bad experience when a guy who came to our local meetup brought it and talked down to us when we couldn't figure out the mystery. Beyond that, it seems like a lot of trial-and-error, which feels clunky as far as social deduction/mystery games go.
There have been a lot for me, the most notable are ones that are generally enjoyed by other people in the hobby:

**Cosmic Encounters**

**Blood Rage**

**Five Tribes**

**Hanabi**

**Alchemists**
* Munchkin
* Fluxx
* Chunky Fighters
* Killer Bunnies
* Gold Digger
* Cards Against Humanity
* We Didn't Playtest this at all
* Mille Bornes
* Boss Monster
So, SO many

CAUTION: Product information says it is in Polish. But the only review is in English!
You can get Alhambra Big Box from Amazon for almost 40% off
For anyone who is wondering, I got my copy and the instructions are in fact English so it's very playable. The tiles do not have text but the currency board housing the tiles does; they simply state the regional currency name.
You can play a Bard in Descent 2E
Welcome back to the dungeon has a bard in it although I doubt it's what you're looking for
I'm pretty sure "bard" is one of the available professions in **Guildhall**.
There's one in 'The Witcher Adventure Game', although the game itself is not particularly great.
**In Tales of Old** expansion for **Darkest Night** has a bard. Lute and everything! It's a co-op game where you try to defeat an evil necromancer with a group of four heroes. As you'd expect Bard is a nice support hero who rocks his lute for various buffs.

2nd Edition kickstarter supposed to ship march 2017 and has expansion heroes included. No idea about retail release date.
You don't get to play them but you do get to fight stinking goody-two-shoes bards in **Dungeon Lords**.

And on the subject of Vlaada, I THINK there's a bard class in **Prophecy** but I'm not 100% sure on that one.
Pathfinder Adventure Card Game has a Bard pack with 4 different bards in it that you can play.

Order of the Stick game has a Bard as one of the characters.  The game is pretty bad but the Bard in the webcomic is very funny.
**Dungeon Fighter** has a bard character to play as. It's what I pick.
Even if the game isn't popular on here, there is a Bard class in **Munchkin**.
So I have **Hogwarts Battle**, **Legendary Encounters: Alien**, and **Big Book of Madness**. Much of what has been said about **Hogwarts Battle** is true. We absolutely adore and love Harry Potter, but we are also experienced gamers who did find the game a bit dull. Our copy of **Legendary Encounters: Alien** has yet to hit the table but **Big Book of Madness** is where it's at for me. I am a proponent of co-ops so when I look at co-op games I mostly consider the downtime, participation, and all the aspects that make it co-op. The Harry Potter deck builder leans itself more towards everybody kinda just doing their own thing for a common goal. Most of the co-op in that game comes when you play a card and say "hey, I can give one of you a coin/attack token/heal" and the occasional "I think we need to get rid of this villain first because blah blah blah". But BBoM has all of the aspects of deck building and co-ops that I enjoy. On everybody's turn you are constantly all solving this puzzle together. How can you optimize the turn so you don't all get hammered with the penalties of a curse? Can you steamroll this monster to get the reward for not triggering any curses? What monster is coming up, do we have enough of a certain element in our deck to handle it? And don't even get me started on the epiphany you get when you're all down on your luck trying to solve a turn where it seems like there's no hope and then it just clicks and you say "Hey, if you play this spell, to make him do this, he can tap that spell, and..." then someone else finishes your sentence and says "YES I see it! That'll make this happen and we banish this monster and win the game!" One big con to this game though, is that it can fair itself to piggybacking very easily. Like in Pandemic, where one player really knows what they're doing, but if that player is aware of the fact that it's just a game and tries to make it enjoyable for everyone it should go smoothly. As it turns out, that piggybacker turned out to be me. So I learned a lot from that.
With games like this I personally think theme is 90% of decision. You need to LOVE Harry Potter to love the Hogwarts Battle game. If you aren't a fan of the Potter series, the game is absolutely dull, but for my wife (who loves the books), it's a blast because of the card flavour, the artwork, the spell and character names that are all first nature to her. For me, I will happily suffer through it for her enjoyment but I'd never want to play it otherwise.

Neither of us like superhero themes at all, so I would never touch the Marvel stuff with a pole.
I would highly recommend **Telestrations**. It's easy, produces great laughs and comes in a party pack that plays up to 12 (though it can accommodate any number below that). I recently played that with a demographic similar to what you're talking about and it was a PERFECT ice breaker.
There are 4 specific actions that are really more useful in a 4 player game. They are marked and you remove them if you aren't playing 4 players. You always sit out one card each round and then draft. The limited pool of action is augmented with the Epic cards which flow around the table pretty freely. 
You can print and play 2 rooms and a boom without too much trouble 
**The Last Banquet** might be worth a look.

While **Codenames** could theoretically handle a group that large, I wouldn't recommend it.  Although, there are enough cards in the box that you could get 2 or 3 separate games of it going at the same time.
You could try doing larger teams for codenames and spyfall, but I honestly don't see it working out that well. Those games are great, but have a limit for a reason.

The only game I can think of right away is Werewolf. Usually can accommodate very large groups. 
If the store has voyages I'd recommend getting it. It's out of print at moment and hard to find for a reasonable price. 
Don't sell Keyflower short! It is arguably more about bidding/blocking than worker placement, and fills a different niche than Tzolk'in or Terra Mystica.

Still, if you don't want anything too close to those games (since you own them already), perhaps Kemet and Five Tribes would have a higher priority. 

I think you have a lot of eurostyle games, so perhaps Kemet would be the nicest addition. It is one of the few games that get my conflict-avoiding friends to feel comfortable in attacking eachother. 

Five Tribes is a great puzzle, and feels relatively unique.
**The Voyages of Marco Polo** is the pick of the bunch for me.  Puzzly, tense game with wildly asymmetric player powers.  
Of those I have played Keyflower, Kemet, and Five Tribes

Five Tribes is interesting, but I didn't find it that fun. I basically spent the whole game seeing the other player's moves and thinking "well that was a much better play than what I did..."  To be fair I've only played it once and I could see it getting much better with more plays. One other point is the AP is strong with this one. 

Kemet is good for the tech trees, but I really don't like card play deterministic combat. Enough so that it kinda ruined the whole game for me. I'd rather have dice or just flat out be 1:1 kills. If you like that kind of combat (and I know it's super popular in my group) then this is a game you'll probably love. 

Keyflower is one of my favorite games. Normally I absolutely hate worker placement and I'm luke warm on bidding, but Keyflower pulls it off in such an interesting way where you can mess with the worker placement by bidding and vice versa. You can also use a space that has been used but for greater cost so that makes the worker placement significantly more interesting to me. Over all, with the merchants expansion, Keyflower is amazing. Without that expansion it's merely great. 
Beyond any shadow of a doubt. **Orleans**. It is an awesome game. Far and above any other game you have listed.


I own **Five Tribes** and **Kemet** out of them and I would not get Kemet if your group will not play it more than lets say 5 times. If people don't know the tiles the game drags on and if they don't try to strategize the game falls flat. But if your group is competitive and will come up with crazy engines than the game really shines that way. Lets talk about **Five Tribes** now. This is my third favorite game (After 7 Wonders and Blood Rage) and I think it is a easy to learn but hard to master euro. I was able to play this even with my mom and she beat us pretty well so people does not need to be gamers to play this altough it helps. What the different colored meeples and tile bonuses do is straightforward but how you come up with those moves is the game. Sometimes you find a crazy combo that will net you 30 points and some of your turns will simple be getting 5 points but setting for different turns. One warning about the game though, if your game group is ap prone consider getting something else because if this game drags people get distracted and it's harder for everyone. 

PS: Voyages of Marco Polo is 30 euro constantly on amazon de and you might want to get it sometime else if you can't find the other games for the same price.

Hope this helps. If you have further questions just reply me :)

Never thought I'd see the day when TI3 fell out of his #1 spot.
Does anybody actually like Sam Healey? He wore a cringey "Rules for Dating my Daughter: #1 You can't!" shirt on some video recently so I can't imagine his daughter even likes him.
Where are Toms and Zee's top games?
I like Sam. For those of you looking down on him, he is quite friendly in person. You can tell that he is incredibly appreciative of fans who express an interest in him. He's not the outgoing person that Tom is, but he is that "grumpy" friend that you would defend to death if he was in your circle of friends.

I don't always agree with him, and he can throw "hissy fits", but I think his perspective is different than Tom & Zee, and those of you who "can't stand him" probably don't get along with many people in the real world..
Sam has only played Twilight Imperium 3 twice? What the fuck?
Was not super interested in the Zombicide series of games until I saw his review and what he mentioned about it.  After watching a few more videos on it, I think I'm gonna track down a copy of Black Plague!
Don't pay attention to his lists since his tastes differ so wildly from mine but, in general, I find him more sad than grating/annoying that redditors seem to feel. Felt this ever since I heard their interview they had with Faidutti on their *Dice Steeple* podcast. 
It's just funny when at least 4 of the games on the list have been released in the last 2 years. It does make the term "of all time" a bit less meaningful.
There's a lot of great solo game options, but if you want a story, I'd recommend **Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective**. Put on some 19th century music, pull out a candle, some tea, and take ok your first case. Don't try to beat Sherlock's score, but try to figure out the first case with the newspapers, phonebook, and map of London provided in the box. It's one of my favorites to play solo. 
All these are good/great solo games:

* **At the Gates of Loyang** - pure optimization puzzle
* **The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** - it has good solo mode
* **CO2** - even though it is semi-cooperative game, it is good as solo game
* **Elder Sign + Unseen Forces** - Yahtzee style with pasted Cthulhu theme
* **Eldritch Horror + Forsaken Lore**
* **Five Tribes** - has official solo variant
* **Ghost Stories** - hard and unforgiving
* **Imperial Settlers** - solo mode is good (not great), but there is official campaign mode I haven't tried
* **Legends of Andor** - euro style puzzle put into fantasy world
* **Lewis & Clark** - I like it's solo mode. You are trying to beat a "clock", neutral player that moves one place a head every turn.
* **Limes** - fairly abstract carcassonne type of game (bingo style for 2 players) that can be played solo (beat your score instead of opponent's)
* **Pandemic**
* **Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island** - highly thematic and hard game
* **Samurai Spirit**
* **Snowdonia** - great solo mode against the neutral company that acts as a timer for the game progress 
* **Mage Knight**
* **Friday** - pure solo game
* **Pax Porfiriana**
* most of Uwe's games have solo rules
I love solo gaming. I didn't partake in it at all, until my wife and I had our son... and now I do more solo gaming than multiplayer gaming. My favourites are those games that keep the essence of the full game intact; that don't need to make a lot of changes to allow for solitaire play. I like games that have you aim for a certain score, and are challenging.

Having said that, my favourite solo games over the past year or so have been:

1\. **A Feast For Odin**

2\. **Terraforming Mars**

3\. **The Gallerist**

4\. **Fields Of Arle**

5\. **Liberty Or Death**


...I'm a big fan of Rosenberg, so not surprisingly, two of those titles are his games. He tends to build very compelling solitaire play into almost all his games. Odin is undoubtedly the best solo game he's done, but Arle and Gates Of Loyang are also awesome.

If you're into heavier stuff, **Navajo Wars** and the just-being-released **Comancheria** are solo only games that tell the story of two native tribes from early first-contact. 
Arkham Horror LCG?
**Lord of the Rings LCG** is very much story driven. It is dark world of desperation where you will try to see if good can triumph over evil. With a small amount of luck, you have full control of what's in your gameplay deck. The game can be punishing but winning is SO rewarding!!!
My go-to solo game is **Space Hulk: Death Angel**. Easy to setup, fast to play, very well themed, hard as nails and brutal as hell. 
I'm still playing **Ambush!**.
**Tiny Epic Galaxies** has a really nice solo mode.
Cuba libre
I would like to add that **Mage Knight** pops up a lot in these solo threads, and it is a great looking game but it is massively polarizing. Some people love it others despise it, do some research before you pick it.
I find there are two very important to distinguish classes of solo board games - short puzzles, and huge experiences. Most people who want one don't really want to be recommended the other.

Short puzzle players like things like the Oniverse series - 30 minutes maximum, with low theme, and gameplay based around solving a small set of problems. (Collecting 8 cards, building the right Tetris setup, etc) Playing the huge experience games would bore them, because they don't want to game alone for that long at a time.

Huge experience players want their solo games to be as epic their regular games. They want to kill an hour or more, with huge, exciting thematic scenarios, such as Mage Knight or Robinson Crusoe. The small puzzle type is too tiny for them.

Which are you?
**Mage Knight** it's a very satisfying puzzle which doesn't have an explicit story, but you can visualise the action based on the cards played. 
Mage knight, Robinson Crusoe,  and lotr lcg are routinely considered the best solo games. The first two are more story focused where lotr lcg is more strategic and tactical.
Whereas people have mentioned **Mage Knight** and **Space Hulk: Death Angel**, I'm gonna say **Legendary: Encounters**. I'm a huge Alien fan so I play though the scenes in my head when completing objects. Once you've initially sorted the cards it doesn't take too long to set up and doesn't take up too much room.
Probably Imperial Assault or X-wing. They're the only games off the top of my head where you can play as solo.
I have not tried these yet, but maybe someone who has can respond. 

I recently picked up **Scythe** and also **Viticulture** which both have single player rules.
**Merchants & Marauders** works great with solo variants. All of the adventure and stories; none of the down time.
**Onirim** is a great solo game. Super fast setup, play and tear down. I've gotten a lot of plays out of it.

**SOS Titanic** is a really good solo game too. Which isn't surprising as it is based off of Klondike the solo card game.

Additionally, the Golden Solo Ruleset for **Marvel: Legendary** is good.
Mage Knight, Eldritch Horror, Scythe, Descent 2 (with app), Posthuman.

I'm a bit shocked no one has mentioned **Mansions of Madness 2nd ed.** It's heavy story themed, but be aware you MUST use an app for it. It's free on Steam, iOS and Android.
**Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm** has a nice solo expansion.
My favourite solo game at the moment would be **Where There Is Discord**, but that game has a niche.  

I quite like **Space Hulk: Death Angel**, and **Flash Point Fire Rescue** too.  

Never managed to get into **Robinson Crusoe** but always willing to give it another try.  

I also recommend the *Leader* series from Dan Versson. I okay heaps of **Thunderbolt Apache Leader**. 
**Robinson Crusoe** is a bastard of a game that's worth your time: even with teammates there's a good chance of failure on each scenario.

**Viticulture** is a lovely game.  The solo variant is very much luck-of-the-draw on the Automata cards: even if your desired move is blocked on one turn, you'll have other viable options to play until the next season change.
I totally second **Robinson Crusoe**. Very thematic and difficult. Definitely checkout the expansion, **Voyage of the Beagle**.

If the theme of **Mage Knight** doesn't strike your fancy, I would also check out **Star Trek Frontiers**, basically the same game with a Star Trek theme.

**Friday** and **Fleet** are both great card games solo. **Fleet** gives you two AI captains that are easy to play with, but enjoyable to beat.


I've found some really good solo wargames, too:

* **Don't Tread On Me** is an interesting take on the Revolutionary War
* Any of DVG's **Field Commander** series
* **Enemy Coast Ahead** has good story to drive the game along
* **Labyrinth** Really enjoy this one as a two player game, but is also very capable as with the included AI bots.
* **Nightfigher** There are some add-on solo rules you can find on GMT's website
* And as mentioned above, any of the **COIN** Series, but it features a bot flowchart similar to **Labyrinth**
One that isn't mentioned yet: **Hostage Negotiator**. In that game you're a police negotiator trying to defuse a hostage situation. The game is really tense and the theme is implemented very well.

/u/r2d8 getinfo
**Descent 2nd Edition** with the accompanying Road To Legend app. I'm enjoying my solo experience quite a bit.
Mice and Mystics
Currently my favorite solo board game is the **Hoplomachus Series**.

No other game gets played as much. 
I think that might change with the current Kingdom Death: Monster Kickstarter but we will see.

Cannot recommend Hoplomachus enough though. 
I appreciate Sentinels of the Muliverse as a solo game. It can be a lot to keep track of, but since it's a cooperative game it's already built for it. 

It's very customizable with the various villains and decks. 
If you hate picking up pieces or you can only play in a shared space that requires pickup between plays, search for the app in the mobile app stores for your device.

Games like Splendor, Patchwork, Tsuro, Catan, Qwirkle, Ticket to Ride, Lord of Waterdeep etc., they're all on there and all play well against the AI or online play or pass and play.
Eldritch Horror is constantly the one I go back to solo.
Marvel Legendary.   Ive played it on my own so many times.
Kingdom Death: Monster is my favorite large solo game.

For small scale, I like Space Hulk: Death Angel quite a bit.
I've really been enjoying warhammer acg solo as well as elder sign with any of the expansions. 
Also a big fan of the oniverse games. 
Fields of Arle looks intimidating but is an amazingly fun solo game. So Zen like and meditative. I can waste a few hours just putting together my village and crafting goods and trading them with other villages. It's so rewarding. 
Look up Death Angel. It can be played as easily with 1 player as with 6.
Warhammer the adventure card game is a fun solo. It plays through a multi part campaign with character progression and can be pretty challenging.
I just got the *D&D Adventure Board Game: Temple of Elemental Evil* and am loving it. I've played some adventures by myself (controlling 1-3 Heroes) and I've played some with my wife. Both styles were a lot of fun for me! 

I recommend it. And if you also happen to be into typical D&D, the minis and tiles are pretty great added value (the Elementals in particular for me, as I usually play a Moon Druid). 
Arabian Nights. 100℅ story game and can be played solo. I'd argue it's always affectively solo even when playing with others
**La Granja**.
The Omega Virus!
Agricola lets you play solo!
I really like Friday. It's Robinson Crusoe themed but doesn't really have a story other than the base theme of helping Robinson defeat pirates 
Suprisingly Scythe is very fun alone with the automa cards.
Dawn of the Zeds 
Darkest Night!
My three favourite Solo games:

**Space Hulk: Death Angel**

**Friday**

**Robinson Crusoe**
Obligatory mention of:
- **Eldritch Horror**
- **Mage Knight**
- **Robinson Crusoe**

These are hands down the best single-player games ever made. 
We all have that friend who quarterbacks **Pandemic** into a solo game
Friday is a great solo experience. Onirim is also a very fun solo game. 
**Mage Knight** and **Falling Sky** are my favorite heavy solo games by a wide margin.
Have to say, having tried LotR LCG and Ghost Stories, they are just far too hard to be enjoyable, particularly Ghost Stories.
**B-17 Queen of the Skies** is one of my favorites. You are more along for the ride (dice chucking), but you do get invested in your plane and crew and I find myself creating narratives about the missions and feel quite sad when I lose a crew member or plane.

I also have been enjoying **Dawn of the Zeds** recently. You really feel a sense of hopelessness, so when you win, it really feels gratifying. Again, the narrative is what you make of it.
Not sure about story themed ones. What is it particularly you are looking for? I've played some games solo, including Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Talisman and Splendor (with variant rules) and I've enjoyed them somewhat. It would be nice to have a more story heavy game, but if I'm looking for a story as well as a game, I usually go for the good old gamebooks by Steve Jackson.
I think the board game version of This War of Mine will be exactly up your street. It's meant to be multiplayer but the interactions and micro management seem geared up to make a really good 1 player board game. 

The kickstarter finished a while ago but it's not a million miles away from production.
Dominion had a great solo varient online.  Your goal was to see how long you could hold out. It used poisons sets. Some turns you'd get a poison or you'd be forced to purchace poison. If your poison was over a certain amount you'd quit and see how much VP you have.  

Eventually you'd find if you were close to dying you'd buy more things to remove poison or more VP as a part ditch effort.  But then your deck is useless with cards that don't really help.  So it was a juggling act mostly. I enjoyed it. 
I love a good solo game!  I don't know why, but I can play a little card game solo, like the ones I mentioned...but just I can't bring myself to play the full blown big games solo. Like, I have games like Pandemic, Zombicide: Black Plague, and the Gears Of War board game, and they're all completely solo-able, but I feel silly just setting up this big, often elaborate board just for me.

I'd say my top 3 small solo titles are:

1. Tiny Epic Galaxies
2. Space Hulk: Death Angel
3. Hostage Negotiator
Castle Panic, Castelliion (Same series as Onirim), Friday, and 7 Wonders: Duel are my gotos.

In "7 Wonders: Duel" I just play each city as optimally as I can, sometimes throwing in a preference (e.g. left player goes for science and right hand goes for military).  
For the obscure: **Thunderbolt: Apache Leader**.
Repost
I like Suburbia single player. I play on my phone all the time.
I'm a big fan of Agricola and also Eldritch Horror for solo play 
**Myrmex** is the killer app for the **Decktet**.

/u/r2d8 getinfo
I just got Onirim. It's not bad. Quick and easy. Games are pretty short and there is a 2 player option. I won on my second game. I'm not sure how much replay value it's going to have though. If I want something deeper I just run 2 or 3 players on Pandemic.
Kingdom Death, is a great solo game!
If it's a story you're after:  **Agents of Smersh**, a cold war spy romp with a "choose your adventure" type of campy story-telling.  Also **A Touch of Evil**, a B movie type of horror game with a 17th century setting and old school monsters to battle - save the town of Shadowbrook!
I've played a ton of Shadows of Brimstone solo, and I loved it. Having multiple scenarios helps keep the game fresh, and the town visits give a nice feeling of progression.
an older war game like **ambush** or  another single player war game

Edit: editing
Friday is a decent little game.  It's pretty short so I can play it when I'm waiting on laundry or on break at work.  The theme is pretty funny too.
I really hate to be that guy, but this is your exact title: https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/search?q=best+solo+game&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all

Unless you are really asking a specific question, doing a quick search will give you the trove of useful r/boardgames stuff. I only say this because I see the same question every two weeks. 
Mage Knight. /thread
Agricola is quite a bit tighter than Caverna. For the reasons you state above, I think Agricola might work well for you.
Based upon your reasons for disliking Caverna, I think you have a much greater chance of enjoying Agricola.

Its still a solitare game, but your competition for spaces is MUCH greater. If one person takes 3 wood, there is no other way to get wood this turn, and that TOTALLY screws you over. 

It is fraught with tension, both for spaces and for feeding your people. Greater than half the time I was trying to feed my people more than building my farm, which leads you to feel like you couldn't accomplish all that you wanted, which leads you to coming back for more.

The occupations and minor improvements also add a level of direction and random setup to the game, and makes it highly replayable.

If you are going to be playing with two or three, also check out Le Havre. It provides the same engine-building, tension filled worker placement that Agricola does.
1. Solitaire game.  That is not going to go away.  There is more competition over action spaces, and more opportunities to block your opponent at a crucial time in the game though.   

2. Caverna is pretty forgiving and gives you several ways to gather the different resources, build over different spots, etc.  In Agricola the action spaces are much more limited in their abilities. Generally, they only provide one thing, whereas Caverna has a lot of "and/or" spaces that allow you to do multiple things. 

3. Agricola has arguably, two main strategies.  (Obviously, there is wide variation and overlap but just for simplicity we'll call it two.) Rancher or Farmer.  In that sense there is a considerable amount of competition since there are really only two reliable ways of building a food engine.  Racing to get the first Fireplace/Cooking Hearth + spots for animals so you can feed.  Or getting all the necessities in place to start farming (2 Grains, 2 Fields, and an oven).  

It's possible that you might like Agricola, but given that you put "Solitaire" as your #1 point, you may not like it.  I suggest playing a few games on playagricola.com before deciding to buy it.  
Agricola is right up your alley, for the reasons you stated above, I plan to own both Caverna and Agricola(I'm waiting for the ultra-premium edition in 2018).

Agricola, has immense engine fighting, as there are only maybe 1/2 ways to efficiently make food, animals are scarce, and so is stone, everybody will also be fighting for the family growth spot when it comes out as well, and the "play a minor improvement"/"occupation" spots as well
Agricola is way better. It is far less sand-box-like than Caverna, as you want to do __everything__ instead of whatever you want, and if you don't do everything, you lose points. The game is cold and cruel. Each turn you must face the tough decision of taking the action you think you want most, or the action you think your opponent wants most so that you can be sure you get that thing.
As such, the game really encourages you to care about what your opponents are doing and figure out what actions they want so you can take them first.

My problems with the game are
1) It takes way too long to set up. If you set up the game and its expansion, it takes literally 30 minutes to set up and then another 15 minutes to clean up afterward.
2) The game takes forever. Basically everybody I've played this with will take 5-10 minute turns overthinking everything (including myself), bringing the game time to something like 70-80 minutes per player, which is absurd. If you ever play this game with 5 players, be sure to have a 2 minute stop watch ready and restrict turn length.
3) The game does seem a little imbalanced regarding minor improvements and occupation cards. As such, it's essential to have two rounds of drafting before the game, and that could take 20 minutes in itself. Don't do this with new players though, as they will have no idea what they're doing.
I'd recommend Splendor and Cosmic Encounter. Splendor is great for short, casual play, and Cosmic Encounter has a ton of replayability.
I'd recommend Smash Up. Lots of content and replay-ability, especially if you get the expansions.
All of the games you're considering look good.

Here are some other recommendations:

Terra Mystica:  like settlers on steroids.  Has engine-building elements like settlers but you play as different races with very different powers and abilities.  No dice in this game so it's all planning and strategy.

Bonanza:  party game where you trade different types of beans.  It shares the trading resources element of settlers.

Bang the dice game: Hidden roles game like resistance/secret hitler where you're cowboys that shoot each other.  Quick fun party game that can play up to 8.

Shadow Hunters: card game similar to Bang, it has hidden roles among 3 different factions.  What makes this game fun in my mind is the win conditions of the neutral characters.
*SPAAAAAARTAAAAAACUUUUUUUUUUUUS!*  

Seriously, **Spartacus: A Game of Blood and Treachery** was the game they made before **Sons of Anarchy**. It's just as vicious around the table, with the same "cut deals, and maybe stand by them", "murder your opponents workers", and general unpleasantness.  

I'd also say that **I'm the Boss** has a similar feeling for cut-throat dealings. As that is a game almost exclusively about needing to cut deals with multiple players.  

But congratulations on picking up the game. It is a grossly under-appreciated title. 
I'll offer some games that may play different mechanically (i.e. not worker placements) but may offer the same feeling of cutthroat and interaction.

**Game of thrones the board game (2nd ed)** - the crux of the game is to give secret (face-down) orders to your troops to move/attack/defend etc and when battle occurs each side plays cards simultaneously. It sounds like what you are after but the game is quite long and shines at 6 players.

**Cosmic Encounter** - Players take control of vastly different alien factions and your aim is to have presence in 5 territories through playing all sorts of crazy cards in battles. Attacker and defender in may call in other willing players to join their side in the battles. Cutthroat, high interaction, high stakes - they're all there.

**Kemet** - This is an area control game with a little bit resource management. Players upgrade their armies and economies through a 'tech tree' system and battle is resolved by simultaneous reveal of cards. A lot of the game is about tactically sneaking into other player's territories to gain control. 
Argent: The Consortium. Considerably more complex but great.
Also wondering this, but something that is playable with 2, and not the gateway style that always gets recommended.
This game is great. Cosmic Encounter is the closest feeling I think.
Lords of waterdeep is always suggested by people in similar cases. I think both are fun, but they really aren't similar at all.    

Mainly just leaving this note so I'll see what games everyone else posts. 
Kingdom Death Monster?
It's a tenuous connection, but is it possible you're thinking of **Cave Evil**?
The art doesn't match the gritiness aspect of your description but **[Massive Darkness](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coolminiornot/massive-darkness "It's massively dark in here, Cyril")** has the light/dark and equipment aspects, so I thought I'd throw it out there.
[Gloomhaven?](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven) 
If you want to try it out more cheaply, I hear the Tabletop Simulator version is good.
I've owned GIPF, DVONN, and ZERTZ. I enjoyed all of them for a while but tired of all but GIPF. Still consider that one the best of the bunch (but I haven't tried YINSH or PUNCT so I can't be certain). I didn't combine any of them either.

Currently I scratch my abstract itch with **Hive**, **The Rose King** and **Aton**, and I'm hoping to add **Arboretum** to the mix once it comes in. One that I haven't played yet but has received some positive attention lately is **Onitama**. 
The gipf series is great. Mostly. 

Dvonn and yinsh are my favorites. Zertz is my least favorite. Gipf and tzarr are average for me. Never played pünct. 

I don't like the idea of a tournament where one game affects pieces in the next. Just do points counting over several rounds. 

There are tons of great abstracts out there. Abalone, mancala, nine man Morris, shogi. I recommend trying all that you can and find out what you enjoy doing in abstracts and then looking for things which highlight that. For instance i love chess and hive gives me that same feeling quicker and more portably. 
Barnes and Noble has their games discounted by 30% and possibly 15% more stacked with BNCYBER16
I look every year and Cyber Monday never seems to be a big time for board game sales. This year looks seems to be no exception.
[Between Two Cities](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/168435/between-two-cities) - Easy to teach and learn.  Quick.  Fun for all ages.

I don't play with children so the rest...well, your mileage may vary.

[Splendor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor) - Easy to teach and learn.  If you like deck building (Dominion), you will probably like the engine building in this game.

[The Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173090/game) - A simple cooperative card game.  Great for plane rides, at a cafe or for a regular game night.

[Lost Temple](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102835/lost-temple) - Very simple racing game with some role selection in the mix to make it more interesting.  Probably simple enough for kids (again, I wouldn't know for sure).

[Camel Up](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153938/camel) - Another light racing game, but in this game you bet on the camels racing rather than racing them yourself.  It's quite wacky with little strategy.  Don't play this game expecting to optimize your play - there is a lot of luck and it's just zany fun.

[Paris Connection](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/75358/paris-connection) - Probably the easiest game ever.  It's a route building game with a stock market.  This one has gone over well for my parent's and other non-gamers as well as gamers.

Best of luck!  :)
My regular gaming group typically consists of my relatively new-gamer partner, my 6 year old daughter, and my 62 year old mother who suffered a brain injury last year. I've been playing all things table top from rpgs to 40k and everything in between for years. We all enjoy different types of games and require a pretty specific type of game for all of us to have fun. With that said we ALL love:

Rhino Hero: unique and super exciting

Castle Panic: easy to understand, cooperative play, can still be a challenge (especially if you add in the expansions)

Zombie Dice: super easy but still fun and fast. (6 year old especially loves this one)

We love everything Looney Labs does (Fluxx, Pyramids, Just Deserts).

Most recently we've delved into No Thank You, Evil which is a blast and an awesome intro to traditional table top RPG action.

Hope some of that helps! Good luck and have fun!

Sorry if you have any of these I can' t access BGG to look at your list.
First, I'm glad they branched out from their first reviews to not just cover "miniature" games. I was worried they were just going to stick to too many similar styles. This is especially good because the editing and reviews are slick and polished and I feel well needed. I'm glad as a whole to see more professional productions in board gaming, a la man vs meeple, etc. 

2nd this game looks really interesting but the long play time is making me really hesitate.  Might have to try a few more looks before committing to such a beast.
I played this game at Gen Con this year and it was great. I'm very biased as I already love everything FFG has done in the Android Universe. But I enjoyed my time playing it and I'll be getting this the first chance I get
Yeah I've been looking for a good medium length negotiation game to follow up Chinatown/lords of Vegas but this just seems like it could take way too long.
So, it's Archipelago with some slight changes? 
I've never been fond of semi-co-op games. There is no individual incentive to stop the "we all lose" mechanism. If I'm winning, I don't want to sacrifice that lead and help someone else become first to keep the game going and if I'm losing I have no reason to care if we all lose. I like my co-ops pure cooperative. 
Not sure how i feel about new Angeles yet. I love negotiation games but i don't think I'm thrilled with the copetative nature of it. All negotiation games are on some level cooperative because that's how you negotiate... This seems a bit forced though.

Here's the link for the previous discussion, which says Wednesday Nov 28th
Where did you see they were going to ship on the 28th? Everything I've seen has said simply "as soon as possible" and "on a first come first serve basis".
That doesn't seem too crazy for a year!  I've been playing about the same amount of time and I have like 30 games lol
Those are some good games, and we have similar taste. Rebellion is amazing. Here are some of my favorite games. You'll find they trend towards the mid-heavy side but you seem to like that anyway. 
Castles of Burgundy,
Eclipse,
Power Grid,
Shogun,
Die Macher,
Terra Mystica,
Through the Ages,
Caylus,
Galaxy Trucker,
Tigris & Euphrates,
Samurai,
Dice Duel, and
Puerto Rico,
Hope that helps.... have a good week of watching reviews. 
Monikers is my favourite party game hands down. Super accessible and I've played it with very different groups. 
Euro's with good theme should introduce you to them. A lighter one that you might like is Champions of Midgard, because... it has vikings and draugr.
Will Weathon's tabletop on youtube did a playthrough of it not that long ago. You could check it out.

I think some heavy euro's like Tzol'kin (the board is a kind of calender, and it moves!) and Terra Mystica (lots of races, magic and changing the landscape, litterly) have a great theme to them. Or even Power Grid if you like to set up an energy company, but it's a bit more dry.

Good look with your search!
That looks like an awesome closet to have.  

Your friends are being dumb, I'd play **Samurai Spirit** anytime.  Seven Samurai is one of the best films of all time!

I wouldn't just try "a euro" to see if they're your thing without getting a recommendation from someone who understands your gaming style and drive.  You could easily be turned off a whole style of game because they matched you to a theme and artwork instead of gameplay you find compelling.  I should write a Q&A form for that...
Came to the thread expecting to see two full Kallaxes, pleased to see only one closet shelf.
Imperial Assault offers a campaign gameplay with character development and decisions that have an effect on how the campaign proceeds. At its base, it's a strategic combat game with some story elements and lightweight character development. 
It's a 1 vs many game so someone in your group needs to play against the others. A companion app is in the works but there's no information about the release schedule. 
You'll also get a great skirmish mode in the same box, which might add some value to you if you're into skirmish battles.

Mansions of Madness is more immersive, I think, but it doesn't offer campaign gameplay or character development between the scenarios. The replay value might also be a bit lower than in IA but overall I like MoM more than IA.
MoM focuses more on the story and investigation. You'll be solving puzzles, finding items and trying to solve the mystery (or defeat the "boss) before you run out of time. Thanks to the app, the scenarios have some randomisation (but only minor things) and nobody needs to play the bad guys.

IA is more combat oriented than MoM, although MoM has still lots of combat which isn't as strategic as in IA and is the weakest part of the game.

I guess, between those two, the question is; do you prefer story over strategy? Both are great games but they scratch totally different itches. Feel free to ask questions about them and tell more about what you're expecting from them and what kind of games you prefer.
I've played couple of the scenarios multiple times and have been enjoying them every time. I guess at some point playing the same scenarios over and over again starts to get repetitive (as with every game) but you should be able to play them few times without issues, especially after you've opened all the schematics and if you play with a different character each time.

I'm more concerned about your plan of playing only with two players. I think you would get the most out of the game with four players but I guess you can play with both controlling two mechs.
It's a pretty fun programing game. I did wish that there were more battle cards to combine, but it works as it it. I just played it again two days ago and was telling myself that I wouldn't mind playing that mission again. 

All missions come closed off in an envelope, to keep the surprises coming for the story, but you can easily jump to previous missions on a whim. 

Missions do play slightly different from one another, and you don't draw the same cards as you would in previous rounds, and if you did, there's still no guarantee that you will get the same cards, because your personal programing board is already set up differently, or the person before you took a card that they needed. 

I didn't fall for the hype when it was announced and was available for pre-sale, but if two of my friends, that I play with didn't already have the game, I wouldn't mind buying it for myself. It's a fun little chaotic co-op where you have to work around what is given to you and all the little things that try to stray you from your plans. It also comes in a huge box, bigger than any board game I've ever seen. 
The "campaign" is really just ten scenarios. It's not something like Descent where a big overarching story is being told. They could really be played in any order you want, but they have a few narrative elements if you play them order. 

The game wasn't for me, but there are about 50,000 reviews so you should be able to get a good idea whether or not it's something you'd be interested in. 
I'm playing a few of the scenarios twice. I'm going through it campaign style with my friends, and then I'm picking scenarios and playing them at the local board game meetup.

The meetup people don't lose anything by not having played the earlier scenarios, except that the rulebook isn't really comprehensive at all and some rules are hiding in previous mission packets so they have to take my word for it.

I wind up playing some of the scenarios twice but it's not less fun for me because I can switch characters, use different special powers, and obviously the cards will shake out differently.

And then there's supposedly hard mode rules for each scenario in the last packet, which I will definitely use from then on because so long as we have 3-4 players I've found the game to be pretty easy.
Replay-ability is kind of on par with a game like Pandemic.  There is enough random components (depending on scenario) to keep the game interesting for a few plays.  SO if you can handle a game like Pandemic in terms of replayability, then MvM should really be not that much different:  
  - 4 unique characters; each have a different Overdrive ability and schematic cards  
  - Die roll for spawning and movement of minions  
  - 10-different scenarios, each with different rules or new introduced mechanics.  
  
  Now, will it get boring...probably.  If you are truly invested in the story aspect, the story doesn't change.  The programming cards only come in 12 flavors, so it does get stale in terms of what your mech can do.  I say if you can get 20 plays of this, then it's probably worth it $4/play.  If you don't envision on ever playing it again, you can just resell it.  I sincerely doubt the market for this game will drop anytime soon.  EVEN with Riot restocking, they are the only ones distributing the game and $75 + 5 shipping -- it probably wont get cheaper than that until maybe a year if they need to clearance it out.  SO, you could always resell it and it would be a decent return for 20-hrs of game play.  
  
  Now, it's unknown if they plan on expanding it -- even just adding a scenario expansion would bring new life into this game -- but I'm sure there will be plenty of fan-made scenarios to tackle.  This could easily be a fun system.

Look up **The Martian ~~Files~~Investigations**. Very similar format but based upon a Martian mining town. I think it costs a dollar or two.
> and all expansions

Oh damn, now I'm jealous. I love the base game, but don't exactly have the scratch to even consider the expansions, haha.
I really wish you had a Portland OR counterpart. I would jump at that chance in a heartbeat. 
If you want to skype in a Central Washington counterpart...

There's a decent number of games running on Tabletop Simulator. Just FYI for anyone else waiting on their 1.5 copy to finish making 10 million dollars and ship out.
That sounds fun. I don't know how much time I'll have until after finals though.
Are there any upcoming cons? You could see if someone with a copy is visiting one. And by that I mean your likely going to have to make a trip up to the Bay or down to LA area. 
Codenames.
My parents are not gamers, although my mother is in a weekly Scrabble group. A few years ago, my girlfriend (now wife) and I introduced them to Qwirkle. And boy did they like it. We brought it up for Christmas, and because I used a score-keeping app on my phone I know that we played *at least* one game every day for the nearly two weeks we were up there. Any time we visited them, or they visited us, there would be at least one game played, and for my dad's birthday one year we got him a set so they could play together (particularly useful when they went on a lovely beach holiday and the weather turned to crap for most of their time).

To be honest, my wife and I got a little tired of all the Qwirkle. It's a perfectly good game, but it got a bit much. So last year we taught them Codenames. And that Christmas, I think we managed one game of Qwirkle. It was amazing, and we'd better remember to pack it when we go up this year or there'll be hell to pay. :P
When I got back into boardgaming this summer my brother was super reluctant to play Suburbia, he looked at the rule pages and just simply said this is too complicated. I watched a how to play video might have been rahdo and walked him through it. He instantly loved it and we played it 3 times that day. Well he still loves it and beats me every single time, in probably 12 or 15 playthroughs I have only beat him once. He even flat out told me his strategy, just get his income as high as he possibly can and then he has enough money to buy any tile he wants. After losing every single time I don't even really care to play it anymore, we played a 4 player game last night with the Inc expansion and the goal on top of the C stack was 10 rep, going for that one put my income so far in the hole I spent the whole c stack lakeing just to pay the negative income fee because my brother spent the beginning of the game buying every single factory. Thinking about that game drives me nuts.
2 weeks ago I had 2 buddies at my place. One never played any board games whatsoever and while the other one did, they both weren't really much into board gaming. But that Sunday they wanted to give it a try (took me several weeks - if not months - to persuade them without them noticing). I had to think hard what would appeal to them. Something really simple to play with a short playing time and lots of interaction. So I thought history, war, dice. I pulled **1775 Rebellion** out and wow, we had such a blast playing it. They loved it so much that they came next Sunday again to play it. We would have played it this Sunday also, but one of them had some work related stuff to do :)
They are still wary of longer games, but they are starting to show some real interest in **Cyclades, Puerto Rico, Mombasa, Concordia, Dead of Winter** and also games like **Falling sky** (one of them wants this one to be our next game), **Fire in the Lake, Maria** and **A Game of Thrones**. I would't say i turned them into board game afficionados, but it surely is a big change of mind :D
A friend of ours is dating a gamer, but is not one themself. We told them about Tokaido, and it turns out they were a art history major that do their senior thesis on Hiroshige. The game is based on [The Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifty-three_Stations_of_the_Tōkaidō) and it drew them right in. Just goes to show that sometimes it just takes the right game. 
My friend and I met up to play games at a local cafe last night and ended up teaching people from the next table over to play Carcassonne. I heard them say "ooh, we should have brought cards!" and I told them that I was about to teach my friend a fun board game and they should join in.

They ended up both saying that they loved it and asked where they could get a game like that.
If Small World or Catan bombs because they don't want to think AND compete. I break out Pandemic.

Usually everyone is more than happy to let me coach, and they enjoy the theme and the collective effort instead of "I guess I will lose to my Actuary son-in-law again".
Eldritch Horror is a great thematic COOP game that plays well at any player count. Also, for Sci-Fi specific I would recommend Space Cadets: Away Missions. These two games are pretty luck heavy however, I have never played a strongly thematic strategic/tactical game.
XenoShyft or Legendary Encounters: Alien, perhaps?
I think you might enjoy **Space Alert**. A real-time cooperative game where you need to work efficiently with your team mates to survive certain space death.
For an interesting, thematic and fairly high skill/low luck co-op game **Mysterium** seems like a good choice. Though you will have a random set of cards and solutions the game is really all about communication and the ability to look at things from the perspective of the other player(s).
Terraforming Mars.  It's great for groups up to five.  Cooperative but with points declaring a victor at the end.
While sharing some mechanisms and iconography, the rest of the game is quite different.  Open-faced drafting, in general, is better for lower player counts, and excels in Duel. 

I do think there is a place for both games in a collection, but if I had to pick one for two players, it wouldn't be close.  Duel is the way to go.
Yes, very much. I think Duel is *vastly* superior to the 7 Wonder 2p variant. It's way more interesting and engaging (so much so that I don't think I ever want to play the full game again). 
7 Wonders Duel plays like a two player game. The two player variant in 7 Wonders feels like a three player game where the third player is a dick and just hate drafts every card. Long story short, if you want to play 7 Wonders with two, get Duel. It's a great game and worth owning even if you have the full game. 

I know I'm in the minority on this, but I really, really dislike 7W:D.  I get the design, I think it's great at what it does, and I think it's an experience devoid of any fun whatsoever and will not be playing it again.  I'd rather play 7W with it's goofy 2 player rules.
They're really different games. 

I think 7WD is purely an improvement design wise over 7W as far as iconography goes in card upgrades, and balance. 
Apples to Airplanes is the comparison here. 

They're very different games. If I had a choice between playing original 7 Wonders 2 player (regardless of the 10+ variants I have tried out at this point) and Duel, Duel wins without question. It wins every time. It wins by a country mile.

You're never "managing" the game so it becomes playable at 2. I have yet to play a variant that got around this. Duel has no management outside of round set up. It's very clean and well considered. It's also wonderfully balanced which is something a lot of 2 player games too often stumble on. 
**7 Wonders Duel** is a completely different game from 7 wonders. There is lots of direct player interaction unlike the 2p variant .
Duel is a different game all together and it was made for two. A lot of times publishers push the limits of player count just to make sales even though the design doesn't work that well with 2 or sometimes bigger groups. 7 Wonders just looses its flair when you have to alternate a ghost player. It's more accounting and quite taxing in my opinion. 
This seems like a decent thread to ask. How does 7 Wonders: Duel compare to Tides of Madness? I have ToM and I really dig the streamlined set collection with the madness mechanics adding the little extra oomph. Is it worth considering 7W:D if I have Tides of Madness?
I really prefer the delayed-take-that moment 7W 2p variant offers. Peeking at your opponent afterwards is such a satisfying experience.
I highly recommend 7 Wonders Duels. It shares some similarities with the main game, but still manages to differ in many areas. It is also really quick and easy to pick up. All pieces are in very high quality and the general design of it feels really solid. If you enjoyed 7 Wonders, I'm sure you'll get some enjoyment out of this as well.

One thing to note. There are 3 different win conditions to the game, but after around 10 plays, we've only ever managed to end the game with the scoring win condition. It could be bad luck or just our own style of play, but I feel like they need to be fleshed out more.
Watch the dicetower review of 7 wonders duels.  It answers your question perfectly.  

My gf bought me 7 wonders duel about 6 days ago. So far we have played around 25 games and I HIGHLY recommend it. We didnt like original 7 wonders that much cause of the lack of player interaction but the 2 player version is absolutely perfect. It is intense, very fluid, strategic and superfast. An average game takes probably around 20-25 minutes. My gf ain't that much into board games but she lovees 7 wonders duel, she says its her favorite game and heck, this might be my favorite 2 player game also. For me personally, 7 wonders duel is just better in every way.
Just wanted to say that we just bought duel. Excited to play it after reading all these comments. 

Been trying to build up games with great 2 player options. A lot of time drafting games don't have great 2p variants. 
I am in the minority on this, but I actually think the dummy player in 2p **7 Wonders** is brilliant. My fiancee was able to turn the dummy into a money-printing machine for herself by forcing him to build cards that required the resources she was producing.

I like 7 Wonders: Duel, but it's a fundamentally different game, and if I had to choose only one, I would go with the original.
[The back of the game's box calls it Camel Up](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815wRkYn%2BPL._SL1500_.jpg)
If the group you're playing with calls it "Camel Up" correct them and tell them it's "Camel Cup", and vice versa. 
It's actually called Amel Cup. The fact that the Amel Cup is raced with camels is definitely confusing though.
I don't care whether you call it camelUp or camelCup, so long as you use camelCase.
The title is supposed to be confusing/read both ways even though the official name is Camel Up.

The working title in German was (T)olles Kamel, which either means Great or Old Camel.
I read somewhere that it was originally supposed to be **Camel Cup** but when translated into different languages it had certain.....implications (of the genital variety) and so they changed it to **Camel Up** for that reason.   The way the title graphic is positioned is on purpose as a nod to the original title, but for the purposes of translation/distribution they will alway say it's **Camel Up**
I was going to upvote this thread to promote discussion of what is truly the most contentious point in board gaming.

But then you committed heresy against the Camel Up empire.
Wait, are you guys talking about **Caumpel**?
Probably my favorite game! 

I've played it 6 times and all the times have been under 90 minutes. All with 4 players, Even with a rules explanation.

Shortest game was 45 minutes with 3 player, after a tied victory condition and winner taking it with 2 conditions.

I've read that some people take a really long time when they don't fully understand all the rules, and the games carries on when it should have ended many rounds prior due to a victory condition being met but missed. 

It may be a good idea to brush up on all the rules so that you sure you're not carrying it longer due to a misinterpreted rule. 

A good way to speed the game up and make it really interesting is to not think too much about the "build a strategy" play.  

The game changes so quickly, that it's more about capitalizing opportunity, rather than a build mechanic like kemet.

Just my two cents. 

I've had a similar experience. This is a game with a bit of a learning curve though. My last game took 4 hours but every turn after the first 45 minutes, someone was allllmost there. I imagine a skilled player could close things out quicker. All that being said, I can't imagine a game taking less than 1.5 hours.
We have had similar experiences. The first games end faster because not all players pay that close attention to the win conditions. As we got better the games also started taking a lot longer which is a bit of a shame. Average game for us takes 1.5 hours. 
If you focus on getting deeds, the game won't go long. Usually a game starts to stalemate when the players get into a slap fight trying to do stop the other from winning. 

If you go for deeds, they will have an incredibly tough time trying to shut down your win conditions, and they won't be able to win themselves because you will easily tie them.

Deeds win games of Inis.
At my FLGS this Saturday we ran quite a few games of Inis. All at 4 player counts, with 15-30 minutes of rule explanations. The longest game ran an hour and a half with most of them clocking in at an hour. 

I think the trick is to teach the players how you win the game before you teach them how to play the game. Inis can stall very quickly if players are meandering across the map and not aggressively seeking win conditions. It definitely snowballs quickly, but it has great competitive catch-up. When I played I went from having two clans at the middle of the game to being able to win (but losing cause I lost my Brenship in the last moment) by the end.
I really love Inis, but I only started loving it after my third playthrough.

The first two someone won by catching the rest off-guard. The third playthrough was the first one everybody was on edge and paying attention. It *did* take 3 hours though. However, I think that was with rules explanation, and people only persuing win conditions after an initial buildup of forces.

You see, I think with Inis, people need to let go of their traditional area-control mindset, and this will take a while to sink in. I've seen people build up all their clans on one area (usually the Bren capital area), because they were afraid to be the first to initiate a feud. But in Inis, the sooner your clans start mingling, the faster the games turns interesting. 



So perhaps it is best that you already hint at this during rules explanation. The first "stalemate" part of the game can hopefully be avoided then.
I've played twice. My first experience was like yours, pretty short. About an hour I'd say. Really enjoyed it.

My second experience, later the same day with different players, was similar. A short amount of time building up, followed by about 90 minutes of Munchkin like scrabbling for victory, one person getting a half step ahead only to be pulled back. I didn't enjoy the second play at all.

I'm not casting final judgement after 2 plays, but man, I'm reluctant to play it a third time.
I really thought you were going to throw a curve ball and say one of the games you played was Trekking the National Parks.
Sad to hear fleet captains components were bad, this is so WizKids, wanted to get it, but availability in my country was terrible.
Frontiers i haven't tried, but i got Mage Knight, LOVE mage knight, so won't be getting the retheme.

Want to get Ascendancy, but again availability in my country is horrible, glad it was good, GF9 really knows how to take a licence and make a good game!

Will wait for as and when  i can get it :(
Great write up, too bad you couldn't squeeze in **Star Trek Panic**, I've been curious about that one as well.
I'm a huge area control fan and I've got to say: Kingdom Builder is *barely* an area control game. I mean, sure you are technically trying to get *control* of certain *areas* on the board, but it really plays like an abstract game.


Don't get me wrong, I like the game. But if you're looking for something more area-controlly, maybe consider the classic **El Grande** (it isn't heavy at all, don't be intimidated) or for something more recent, maybe **Small World**.


If you're curious about **Kingdom Builder**, maybe give the smartphone app a whirl before buying the game. Its on sale I believe.
This is a natural progression of the BG hobby I've found.  

1 - What is this game I've never heard of?  You mean there are more like it?

2 - BUY BUY BUY

3 - HEY GUYS I'M NEW TO THE HOBBY BUT HERE IS MY COLLECTION OF 50 GAMES I BOUGHT OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS WHAT ELSE SHOULD I BUY??? 

4 - Is there a dice based card drafting worker placement game based on the works of Jane Austin?  I think that's a hole in the collection we need to fill just in case buy game group wants to play something like that...

5 - Huh... I have games still in shrink sitting on my shelf that I bought last year and I'm really having a difficult time getting some of these others to the table with my group these days... must be time for...

6 - THE PURGE!!!!  If it doesn't check off the right boxes in our group, it goes...

7 - Huh, so I really only needed 10-25 games after all?

Years ago I did a purge similar to yours and in the end only had to "re-buy" one game that my wife and I missed after a few months.  Now we buy maybe 1-2 new games a year.  Once you start gaming with a group that starts buying their own games, it becomes less important that everyone owns the same games.
You kept the trump game? Lol. 
Yeah sometimes I think about throwing away my collection and just keeping Ra as well.
Would love a 'before' photo as well. Have one?
Why did you get rid of so many games? 
What is the Trump game?
how is game of thrones? is that the second edition or first?
I have no words.
Great collection.

I'm thinking about doing a purge myself.  What avenues did you use to dump your games?  I know I could go Craigslist, Ebay, BGG Marketplace, but I am curious if you had more success using one particular method?
I try to keep a low footprint in everything. 

1. Get what is useful and what is used frequently.
2. If finished using and not using them remove.

Often I find cheap, simple things are 1 and expensive complex things are 2. Exceptions are the rare 1-off/of-a-kind and are to be treasured!
Glad to see Sons of Anarchy made the cut. A really unappreciated gem.
Quick update since I added a link to an old image file (6 months ago)
Getting rid of stuff you do not like anymore is super freeing. You do not end up playing stuff your friends like but you cannot stand anymore.
I know its all personal choice but I found it funny to see Welcome to Dungeon. I just taught my wife that game today because she wanted to play something before work and only had 30 minutes. We got that out and played it with the roommate. After a few rounds she says "This game is boring, I hate it, lets not play it again." and it moved into the "take to the flea market" pile.
We have both Viticulture Essential Edition and La Granja and really enjoy both at 2p.
Have you looked at Uwe's glass road? It's quicker than Loyang but still an enjoyable puzzle.


Haven't played Loyang (but own it). Viticulture is a medium weight worker placement. La Granja I sold after a single play. I couldn't see the game. I would compare La Granja to Luna (way better game). Viticulture is also expandable (hugely, but the expansion will cost you a similar amount to the base, but it's worth it). 

So my pick is Viticulture. 
I've played most of Rosenburg games and love almost all of them. I was super excited to try Loyang at BGGCon this year... and was extremely disappointed. Outside of the cute veggie meeples the game is fairly plain mechanics and strategy wise.

However, having said that all three games are extremely different. If I had to rank them I'd put Viticulture first, then La Granja as a close second, and Loyang as a far distant third.

In response to your edit, I think Fields of Arle is probably one of your best bets for a deep two player strategy Euro and i'd probably recommend it over all three other games.
I own (and love) Fields of Arle, but if I had to get rid of one of my 3 Rosenbergs (Caverna, Glass Road FoA), it would be this. Also, is it available right now? Next year there is to be a definitive edition of Agricola too. Maybe keep an eye on that.


I enjoy viticulture but it is significantly lighter and does not have the staying power of the Rosenberg games. The solo game is pretty good for a while though.
I own all three, and never would've considered them in the same paragraph before. They're all wildly different from one another. If I had to put them in a buy order, it would be **Viticulture** -> **At the Gates of Loyang** -> **La Granja**.
I can't say much about **At the Gates of Loyang** as I haven't played it, but I do own the other two.
For some reason I like **La Granja** a lot more than **Viticulture** which still is a great game, but also feels a lot more simple compared to the puzzle **La Granja** brings to the table. I just got **Tuscany** last week and have yet to play it, but I hope it will shake up the gameplay a little. The problem is that the base game gets old very fast. It's fairly simple to new players and I wouldn't turn it down, but **La Granja** is just so much more meatier in my opinion. You've got plenty of decisions to make with the cards you are dealt and all the mechanics fit so nicely together that it makes for a great brainburning puzzle. 

It's probably my favorite game to play solo as well.

We bought a couple of those business card holders that have tiered multiple slots for cards for use in saving table space with games that have lots of decks, like Arkham Horror and Firefly.

Metal coins, I own... a lot of different thematic sets.  Legendary metal coins by [Drawlab](http://www.drawlab.com/shop/orc-set-legendary-metal-coins-2/) are my favorite brand.
My pizza stone or cast iron pan. You cant leave all the guests hungry after all
Any kind of small bowls or ramekins. No fiddling with piles of chit. 

Plano boxes for the same issue (or a Broken Token organizer if you really love a big set-up game).

A dice cup so I can roll without knocking things about on the table.
Beer.
A dice tower can be fun, especially if it's thematic for the game. (It can look like a castle and be used for a medieval themed game, for example.)

If you know anyone who plays games that have non-custom (the sides are just numbers) dice, some more beautiful replacements might be nice, depending on how much they like dice.

If any of your friends like hidden role games with night phases, I'd highly suggest buying them a mousepad-material playmat to play them on. They won't be able to hear what happens when everyone's eyes are closed on such a cushy surface. Truly life changing.


* Dice tray  
* Plano box <-- HIGHLY RECOMMEND  
* Business card holders  
* Set of different sized plastic baggies (or tuckboxes if you got time to make them) <-- optional, depending on game 
* A short, small table/cup holders. No food/drinks on the main gaming table <-- I'd say it's required  
* Component upgrades (acrylic tokens, translucent dice, actual gems...)  
  
* Wet wipes (to get rid of finger grease)  
  
some people prefers dice tower than dice tray over concerns of cheating. I trust my group to not cheat and I prefers physically rolling the dice with my hand than letting some dice tower do that for me
My personal favourites: 

**Dice** are always a good go. I've been spoiled and am used to every player having their own set of dice. This eliminates people having to pass dice around (and potentially knocking stuff over) 

Of course, passing dice around is a good way to signal who the active player is. Which leads me to:

A custom **first player maker**. A lot of games come with a first player marker. Some of these are cool, others are unwieldy. I've done away with all that and made my own custom ones. Now we don't have to go through the hassle of identifying which of the tokens in a game is the one for the first player. 

**Game mats** are another good luxury accessory, depending on your default gaming surface. It makes cards and tokens easier to pick up and muffles the sound of dice rolling on a hard surface (and protects said surface) 

**A dice tower/dice tray** might as well roll your dice in style and prevent them from flying across the room at the same time. 
Well the Table of course !

Joking asside, a GOOD table goes a long way to make playing more comfortable. Having enough space for the board, your own little space and then some more to feel comfortable is more important than having silly cupcakes cups to put your tokens in...
Origami boxes to hold tokens.
Tiny suction cups for *18xx* fans, someone mentioned poker chips, line laser for certain tactical battle games, and I bought ~150 deck holders in different sizes to hold player pieces or resources (the latter is convenient during the game too - open it up, pour half of it into cover and you have 2 "banks" on either side of the board). 
* a game mat so you can pick cards and tokes up without problems (you can buy neoprene mats quite cheap online)
* dice tray
* dice tower
* fancy dice, huge pool to select from
* a card shuffler (I prefer the manual ones)
My favourites:

Uberstax - Modular card and chit holders http://uberstax.com/

Card Trays. I use these http://www.thebrokentoken.com/tabletop-card-holder-4-tray-mini/

Counter Trays. I use these https://www.amazon.com/DVG-Deep-Bookcase-Counter-Trays/dp/B00QURNY4Q

**metal coins** make many games actively better. i didn't believe it until i tried it, but it makes a surprising difference!
Star Trek Frontiers is based off Mage Knight, my number 1 solo game of all time.
Apart from theme, and one minor concept change, I believe the game is the same, and i highly recommend it. Superb gameplay, the rules may take longer to digest but it comes together seamlessly for me after few plays. 
Highly replayable! I recommend it. Especially, if you Star Trek theme is okay for you to not have it, go for Mage Knight board game + Lost Legion expansion is superb!

Can't comment on MoM 2nd ed. Only played first edition. But I saw some videos on gameplay, I'd still go for MK
Thematically and scope wise Arkham LCG covers the same ground as MoM.  Small scale intimate mythos action.  Of course mechanically very different.

If you really like deck building (2 cores of the LCG) then the card game is much more re-playable not due to story but because how differently the classes play.

Despite the above I do very much enjoy MoM 2nd edition and will be getting the expansion content.

I happen to *love* that stuff, so yeah I got all that plus **Eldritch Horror**, **Mythos Tales**, even **Arkham Horror**.

While I've not played Frontiers, perhaps that would be the better path to take if you aren't a mythos super fan.
Was it [Mind Maze](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5463/mind-maze)?
Pathfinder?
Update your wishlist. 
Tell him about your gaming preference, likes/dislikes, some games that you're looking forward or hoping to try out. Let good'ol santa have some information to work with so he could pick a great gift for you!
You can put comments on games in your wishlist, to explain why it is on your wishlist.  General comments about what you want should be in the comments section of your application to the BGG Exchange. Hey may mean to update that.
Usually have **Star Realms** with me. Easy to teach and a fun game. Got some board game converts started down the road with that one.
**Hive Pocket** stays in my vehicle's center console. 
I usually carry a regular card deck but I mostly just practice ruffle shuffling with it :)

I'm sure there are people out there that never leave home without their Kingdom Death box!
Love Letter is almost always on hand. 
well i bring my copy of ** Tiny epic western**, **BSG Express** & **Secret hitler**, always hoping for moments i can encourage people to play them.
I carry a homemade version of **One night ultimate warewolf** in my bag. It's just 10 compact plastic tiles.

I don't carry it everywhere, but I have a deck box with Love Letter, Lost Legacy, Brave Rats and... Something else which goes in my bag when I'm out with my partner, just in case we go grab a sit down drink or snack and fancy a game.
**Red7**, **No Thanks**, **Deep Sea Adventure**, **Sail to India** (Janky Okazu Brand version) and **A Fake Artist goes to New York** are currently in my bag.
Mice and Mystics!


Great game
You may want to look at above and below. It's not traditional fantasy but it really captures the story telling in a great game. The world and art is icing. 
If she doesn't mind a game with little in the way of actual game mechanics, **Tales of the Arabian Nights** is a good shout. It's pretty easy to learn, because its pretty much all about the story and adventures. 
**Tales of Arabian Night** is the board game version of Choose Your Own Adventure books. It is more of an experience than a game and it often offers chaotic and random encounters but I like to play it for fun.
Is she fantasy heavy or light? [Lords of Waterdeep](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110327/lords-waterdeep) is a lighter game that gives the player less in your face classes, and breaks it down to a Euro 'cubes on a map'[I just made that shit up]: a la, this is 3 fighters, 2 clerics and a mage solving a quest VS a character sheet. Great game with no real RP involved. But you can! Mildly, I suppose.. ya.. But I still call them by their class!

It's a great game even at 2. Play the core and if you like it then get the exp!
Food Chain Magnate
Just getting into games. Played sentinels of the multiverse once and would love to get it. Would be my first game!
**Mission Red Planet**. Seems like the perfect weight for my group and it fills the area control gap in my collection. Plus the theme is great.
**Great Western Trail**

I've yet to find an Alexander Pfister game that I don't enjoy and several of his medium weight games are near the very top of my list (**Mombasa** is my third favorite game of all time). Trail seems to be another great mix of mechanics in a very thematic box without too much overlap with his other games.
I'm just starting my collection, but I'm hoping for Pandemic (or Legacy) and Dead of Winter.
Mansions of Madness as a gift and Kingdom Death: Monster KS as a treat from myself to me :)
Pretty excited for **A Feast for Odin**, glad Cardhaus had it in stock. Come January though, **Gloomhaven** will be the only game I have eyes for.
Mansions of Madness, all expansions for Zombicide and Blood Rage, Viticulture, and all Ticket To Rides.
But I'll probably not get any games this year as I already know what my Xmas gift is. 
**Power Grid**. I always become unexplainably obsessed with a game during the holiday season, and my mind latched onto that one. Last year it was Catan, because I was just getting into the hobby and looked forward to having my first gateway game, so I could get my friends involved.
**war of the rings** since it is finally being reprinted in December and will be available at MSRP.
**Mexica** is the top of my list. I'm really excited for the game and it looks gorgeous. I'd also like **Millennium Blades** and **TIME Stories** but I could yes or no on those really.
I would love either **Food Chain Magnate** or **A Feast for Odin**.
I was hoping for Netrunner. My wife ordered it the other day :)
My lust for **Captain Sonar** is almost too much to contain. 
Well, I would treat this question pretty literally, meaning I'd only be asking for games that are currently available via retail means and wouldn't render the rest of my family's purchasing power kaput for the holidays (*so*, no Satan pledge for KDM, haha). That said, those currently topping my list are **The Great Zimbabwe** and **Indonesia**.
I've just asked everyone for Amazon gift cards. Trying to coordinate family to purchase an Ironjawz army for Age of Sigmar simply wasn't happenin' :)
Merchants and Marauders
Up until yesterday it was **Scythe**, but then I... accidentally... ordered it ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Now it's probably **Above and Below** or **Captain Sonar** (even though I would so rarely get it to the table)

Edit: fixed the shruggie
May or may not splurge on **Ghost Stories: White Moon** expansion and engraved dice from publisher's promo shop. Pretty content otherwise.

... Of course, I'm writing this *before* getting my tax returns this year.
Was going to be Scythe a couple months ago, but changed it a couple times, **Orcale of Delphi**, **Mystic Vale** and what not. Right now I just want **Captain Sonar** and **Deep Sea Adventure** delivered.
Grim Slingers 
**The Colonists**. I'm slowly getting into games with longer play times than the standard two hour Euro I'm used to. 
It's a toss up between Trickerion, Food Chain Magnate, or Great Western Trail.
Caverna. Closely followed by Baseball Highlights 2045. 
Just need a couple thousand dollars so I can get extras from the Deep Madness pledge manager when it opens, go for Titan pledge add-on for Mythic Battles: Pantheon, and some kind of pledge for Kingdom Death: Monster. May just skip KDM and only get base game on MBP because I don't have that much money. Too bad they didn't time this a little better, they could have had pledge managers open when people are getting tax checks and they will make much more money...
Mine is **Above and Below**.  But **Adrenaline** and **Orleans: Invasion** are also pretty close to the top.
I'm just starting my collection, but I'm hoping for Pandemic (or Legacy) and Dead of Winter.
Fabled fruit, meduris, or Hellas would all be great. I've only recently discovered Stefan Dorra and i want more. 
All expansions for **Blood Rage**. Tho Portal is taking their time with the polish release. The release date was pushed back two times allready. It would be nice if they make it before Christmas :(.
**Key Market** reprint.  Definitely not going to happen - neither is getting a copy in the US for <$300.  I have no other complaints at all though.  I just ordered **A Feast for Odin** and **La Granja** for me (on behalf of my family) - should be here tomorrow or Tuesday!

**Cottage Garden** and **Lorenzo il Magnifico** would be up there too, but I'm waiting for US/English print runs sometime next year.
I'd love to get **Cuba Libre** and maybe increase my chance of finding COIN players slightly.

I'm pretty excited for **Adrenaline** too but I'm not sure if it will be available by then.
*Mythos Tales* and *Deception: Murder in Hong Kong*
I'm just getting started with my collection so at this point anything. I've passed on a list of £20-30 games I'm interested in to my family so that they can chose from it if they want to do that. Weirdly the game I hope I find most seems to be fuse just now, which is a bit surprising given how many games are on that list. And I hope my boyfriend picks up the hints (blatantly stating "look at this game, I want this game but I can't justify buying it right now") for Fortune and Glory. There's lots of games I will buy myself. There's some games which are a bit lower on my list that I wouldn't buy for myself right now so hopefully a few of them appear and they can then be played on Christmas Day and Boxing Day
I'm hoping for some expansions this season. Istanbul: Coffee and the Village: Inn expansions are at the top of my list. I would turn away from Concordia or Kanban, though :)
Jamaica. And it's in the mail.
Scythe looks absolutely amazing, although I am really hot for Terraforming Mars right now. It just looks and feels really great, and I highly enjoy the theme of it. Being able to counter other players in indirect ways by crashing a meteor on the planet, which sets others things on motion and so on sounds really fun with a group of people.
I know I'm getting Isle of Skye already, and I'm pretty psyched about that. The one game I played was a lot more fun than I expected.

I also have Little Prince: Make Me a Planet, the new Cacao Chocolatl game expansion, and Mexica on my list. I bought a ton of games in the past few months so I tried not to have too many games on there.
The New Pandemic: Legacy or the new Cards Against Humanity: Green Box.

Stoked for both...will get them eventually hahaha
Betrayal at house on the hill. Super fun game.
Tyrants of the Underdark. Been on my list since Gen Con but never got around to pulling the trigger, kept getting bumped for other things. Looking forward to it!
**1822** is the game I most want, but don't want to pay for. 
Blood rage and dominion adventure
Black Orchestra

I'm a little salty because I was waiting for the CSI sale to actually happen...and now it's sold out.
I'm at a bit of a loss this year. I'm trying to think of a title that I really want but I'm not finding one. Send halp!
Captain Sonar probably.  
Would never buy it for myself.
Xia: Embers of a Forsaken Star - definitely #1. 

Also, just about the only thing left on my list thanks to good timing of a small cash bonus and recent sales knocking out the rest.  Really feel like Christmas already hit and I'm more than satisfied until whenever EoaFS is released.
I've got no hype cravings and I am very happy with my collection right now. I will try to craft a wooden *Mancala* and *Xianqi* board in the holidays. **Ra** and **Isle of Skye** are on my wishlist, but I often like making lists and carefully sorting items more than buying the real stuff.
**Cottage Garden** and  **Space Cadets** is what I'd ask for. I like both games and wouldn't complain if someone bought them for me, but I'm also not crazy enough about them to buy for myself over other titles. 

We just got **Scythe**, **Terraforming Mars**, **7 Wonders: Duel Pantheon**, and the **Climate Evolution** kickstarter copy recently so I've already spent my allotment for personal holiday splurges. 


It's either Scythe or Room 25 Ultimate Edition for me
Mansions of Madness 2E, though my dad is really bad at not asking or telling me discretely so its pretty much a given its gonna be under the tree this Xmas.
I'm actually pushing down new board games on my list since I just acquired a good amount of new ones, but highest is currently **Trieste**.
I'd really like to get **Pandemic Legacy**. Mostly because I don't think I'll ever buy it for myself at this point and I think it will motivate some of the people I play with to get together and play more often. Another one would be **T.I.M.E. Stories**. Games with limited replayability that I've yet to gamble my money on.
Terra Mystica!
Dead of Winter.

I keep hearing good things about it.
La Granja

Mechs vs Minions

Cosmic Encounter
Kingdom Death: Monster. 

Pretty please, I've been very good this year!
Terraforming Mars, but unfortunately my wife didn't quite get the not so subtle hints before it was sold out at MSRP or less online. 
War of the ring 2nd edition
This is cheating, since I'm certain my wife already got these for me, but I'm looking forward to **New Bedford** and **New York 1901**. 
Descent 2nd edition 
Really wanted to pick up Mechs vs Minions, but for whatever reason they're not shipping to Puerto Rico.
Betrayal at the House on rhe Hill
Tales of the Arabian Nights. I played it once in 2010 and loved it! I found it on Amazon for $39.99 so when my mom asked what I wanted all she got in response was the link.

Dominion or Lanterns would be good too.
Any expansion for **Time Stories.** Been enjoying that game but would love to extend its life.

Also, **Carcassonne** because my SO loves it 2 player. 
As one of the few dissenters and a heavy game lover, I don't have any games on my list. The current agenda is to get the games that I have played. I have plenty of games that are sitting around:

- Battlestar Galactica

- Arkham Horror

- Rex: Final Day of an Empire

- Here I Stand

- Twilight Struggle

- Chicago Express
You know the KS edition of Scythe isn't available for purchase unless you want a second hand version or even worse pay a scalper a premium.

What you will be able to do is a DIY KS edition and get the base and all the promos (extra cards, dials, metal coins, extension and realistic resources) from external sellers like MeepleSource.

Thats personally what I've done, its cost me about $250 to get it all together but worth it for my favourite game of the year. Just wish i was able to get on the KS in the first place...
Pushfight.  Ever since playing it at Pax South this year It's been at my #1 spot, but I can't justify the money at anytime this year.  
Vast: The Crystal Caverns
Based on nothing other than the fact that I almost backed it and didn't, and my FLGS just got it in, Fireteam Zero. The box is freakin' *huge*!
**Viticulture: EE** or **Lords of waterdeep** + exp
My personal #1 would be INIS but my girlfriend and I lost a decent portion of our collection in Hurricane Matthew so I'm dead set on surprising her with as many replacements as I can for Christmas. INIS can wait... for now. 
Shared place between **Kings of Air and Steam** and **Game of Thrones: The Boardgame**... 

Or, if it's a small sock: **Exploding Kittens**
**Leaving Earth**
Mechs vs Minons and/or Terraforming Mars. Can't decide
Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective - I'd love another good solo game!
Not sure I will be able to get my hands on it in time but Lorenzo il Magnifico is at the top of my hit list.
Picked up on Black Friday, nothing more expected for christmas:

1)Forbidden Stars, 2)Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Swamps
Number 1 at this point?  My copy of **High Frontier 3rd Edition** being delivered, but OSS/Ares Magazine is such an incompetent company I suspect Phil will have to take over and make good on the kickstarter instead.

If they'd ever reprint Iron Dragon, I'd be all over that - heck, I'd even take a decent used copy now that my map is destroyed... one of my most played games.

I would love to find a reasonable priced copy or gift copy of either American Megafauna with expansion(s), Antiquity, or Infidel: Men of Iron II wrapped up to be opened... but those are either incredibly expensive or nearly impossible to find anymore.

Maybe a copy of Greenland 1st Edition and Pax Porfiriana 1st Edition would be nice - I didn't like the 2e artwork for Greenland and the deluxe box is not the same size as most the other games (but then again, Pax Renaissance came in a bigger box and broke the small box trend of recent Sierra Madre Games titles).

So what floats to the top?  My realistic expectation is for **Leaving Earth: The Outer Planets** or maybe a printplayproductions copy of The Artifact, Hidden Intruder, and/or the Last Frontier.  Maybe Agricola: Master of Britain or another Hollandspiele game title could be in the future, but I'll probably go to wargamevault and buy print and play files instead.

Oooh, or maybe I'll get some Sierra Madre Games poster maps from Zazzle - Bios: Origins, High Frontier, Interstellar, and Lords of the Sierra Madre would be nice.
I'm just starting my collection, but I'm hoping for Pandemic (or Legacy) and Dead of Winter.
I'm just starting my collection, but I'm hoping for Pandemic (or Legacy) and Dead of Winter.
**Indonesia**
If it helps bring your spirits up, OP, get retail Scythe and just buy the extra KS stuff off Stonemeyer's website when they go up. 

Will cost extra, but they don't do exclusives.
Probably Mansions of Madness or Food Chain Magnate, they seem interesting but I've been hesitant to get them because munz.
I'm asking for SeaFall, because I like 4x and I like legacy and I have enjoyed so far the first half of Pandemic Legacy. 

Also maybe The Goonies Adventure Card Game because I literally just found out about it and I hope it's good. 
**Quantum** or **Istanbul** maybe? Both somewhat light/short games that scale well and are less likely to be picked in a family thing.
**[Bohnanza](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008URUS/)**

If you want something that can be played with more than 2 but less than 7 and nobody else will buy, try **Dungeon Raiders**.  It's by the author of Sushi Go! and is a great, easy-to-learn game for up to 5 players.  
Colt Express is a fun game, in my opinion. Plays up to 6 and has a good mix of strategy and simplicity. Revealing the cards and playing out the round gets some good laughs with everyone shooting and stealing from each other. Plus the 3D train is awesome!
King of Tokyo, maybe?
**Splendor** is great for kids, in my experience, as is any flavor of **Sushi Go!**. 
Junk Art is wonderful fun for all families!
What games didn't you think were right for them, and what was your reasoning? What's an idea for the sort of thing they might like?
**Looney Quest**, **Karuba**?
You may find neuroshima hex to be a good fit. It's certainly a game that two players can sink their teeth into. 

Summoner wars is another excellent game that, if you desire to, includes deck building to customize your army deck. 

And if you want something war like, why not a war game! Do you share a common interest of historical time period? Gmt and Columbia both make excellent wargames over a variety of time periods. I prefer the block games to the chits but both are great fun. 
If you want a good two player war game then you might look at **Twilight Struggle**. Cold war themed if he likes that. Reminds me of Risk but with a lot more strategy. You might be a little lost the first game or so but its one of those games that gets better with each play as you learn new strategies. Probably slightly heavier than those other games, but that will hold true for most war games. 

If you want a lighter two player game then maybe check out **Hive**. Reminds me a bit of a modern day chess game.

If you want more players then maybe check out **Blood Rage**. Its not really a war game, but there is some combat/area control in it and its a fun game.
I know these aren't board games, so sorry about wrong sub, but I think the **JackBox Party Pack (1/2/3)** on PC work really well for this kind of thing. In my opinion, three is the best, but you can still have a ton of fun with one or two.
you should look into Resistance: Avalon.
You can also try Secret Hitler which is similar to Resistance but also has a free Print and Play version!
Spyfall and Spyfall 2 (if it's actually released yet) could be fun. 
**Mafia de Cuba**.  [Here's the SU&SD review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw3-CM52z-g).

u/r2d8 getinfo
**Resistance** comes straight to mind.

u/r2d8 getinfo
ask anything works very well in these kinds of situations. wits and wagers work as long as you dont have a "why do i get all the hard tasks? fuck this game im not playing" friend
If you haven't tried **Wits and Wagers** you definitely should.  I've had great success with it with both gamers and non-gamers alike.  It definitely fits with the casual party vibe you are going for.
I'd recommend [One Night Ultimate Werewolf](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147949/one-night-ultimate-werewolf), with or without [the expansion, One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/163166/one-night-ultimate-werewolf-daybreak).

It's one of my favorites for groups from 5 to 10. The rounds are quick, you can play without a moderator (though it can be helpful to have one), and it's easy to learn and teach.
**Skull**  can be done with makeshift components, specifically beer coasters.

u/r2d8 getinfo
**Monikers** is a party game similar to Celebrities or Charades, but with a silly/pop culture twist. It's not ageist, either. There's also a free print & play version up on their website.
It doesn't go up to 10, but my friends and I have really enjoyed King of Tokyo.  

I feel like you could make really good drinking rules to it as well.
Shadow hunters. 

Up to 8 people,  minimum 4, I think probably best with 7. Each player is given a character, either a shadow, a hunter, or a neutral with a special power and a specific win condition.  No one knows who you are, but the hunters want to kill the shadows and the shadows want to kill hunters and the neutral have other random goals.  You roll some dice collect cards and puzzle out who is who in order to attack to the right targets. 

My gaming group loves it. 
We love to play Telestrations when we aren't in the mood for anything serious. 
*Dixit* or more task oriented *Mysterium* are fun an easy to pick up; up to 5 players I think. 

*Concept* is also light and in the same vein.

*Parade*, *Cockroach poker* and *Sushi Go!* are quick card games - approximately 15 to 30 minutes. 

All the above are mostly language agnostic. 
Cash and guns is a good pick for a big group while drinking!
If you're into deck building style games, I do enjoy dominion
not exactly a board game but "keep talking and nobody explodes" is pretty great. 
The answer to this question is so obviously telestrations. My group under the same situation has already wore out two sets of markers beyond the first ones that came in the box.
Deception: Murder in Hong Kong
Dixit. It's a classic, easy to learn, little to no setup, short games, uniquely fun.
Bohnanza! is really good at this and plays well with 4-6 players. Easy to learn and play and involves alot of trading and talking shit with other players. And it's super cheap.
Dead Last is awesome for this sort of thing. 

https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/review-dead-last/

Basically, you need to get a majority of people on board with killing someone without that person knowing. So you end up winking, head nudging, whatever, in an effort to subtly kill someone.
You said you weren't keen on bluffing, and you're also going to have a fairly large group.

&nbsp;

Based on what I've played/own, I think that **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** could work well. It's more of a puzzle everyone is trying to work out, but someone at the table will also be trying to mislead everyone else. Not too focused on bluffing/outright lies.

I also agree with the **Secret Hitler** recommendation, but you like what you like, and if you're resistant to bluffing then I can understand that. I hope you all have a great time, regardless of what you pick!


/u/r2d8 getinfo 
give **Good Cop, Bad Cop** a try. The game is fun and you'll have lots of laughs. People will probably want to play 2 or 3 games in a sitting.
Salem is a great game for a big group 
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175549/salem

Get two Red Dragon Inn sets (up to 8).


**Mascarade** works well with lots of people and I've tested it with beer, works great :)
**King of Tokyo** is great with a bit of booze!  Maxes out at 5 players but goes fast enough (20-30min) that people can take turns playing.
**Spyfall** is a great game for 5 to 8 people playing at the. The game is quick, easy, and in-depth enough to play over and over again. 
Red Dragon Inn is a pretty fun game (although the theme might not fit for all people), which really sets a social atmosphere with the way the game is set up. Make sure to bring tons of drinks to the table if you decide to go with this one.

There are several priced versions of the game, which just includes different character decks. If you're gonna be 5-10 people, I'm sure you could go with the moderately priced base game.
**The Resistance** Good for up to 10 players. Simple rules!
Exploding Kittens and Anomia are pretty fun!
Citadels. Easy to learn, portable (box is about the size of three card decks), and has some depth for those looking for something with more strategy. Setup time is also really quick so has a good depth/ setup time ratio.

It has similar feeling to "hidden role" games without requiring  bluffing, as it is all about what character card you choose for the round.
Codenames is any number but that's the sweet spot. Everyone I've shown likes it and it's easy to play if 2 of you know the rules.

No one's gets eliminated during play

Number one party game on BGG
Resistance and Coup are my go to party games. That  or scategories. 
Bandu is amazingly fun when drinking. It adds another level of difficulty. 
Monikers is my vote 
Perhaps **Spyfall** would work in this situation. I consider **Good Cop, Bad Cop** a party/deduction game, consider it also. 

Finally, look into **Millions of Dollars**,  is getting good reviews.

 These all max at 8 however.

Also, not strictly a "party" game but **Avenue** plays tons of people and it's very fun and light.

I would highly recommend Secret Hitler and Ca$h n' Gunz. If you're interested in why, you only need ask.
It's a good game every once in awhile. The setup of it creates an interesting puzzle that's fairly unique (different doctors, different room effects) and the cube bag management is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately boils down to the same game every time.  Everyone I've introduced it to has enjoyed it, but no one actively looks to play it again.

Rahdo has a good runthrough of the game mechanics if you're interested.

My only real gripe is the Victory Point Games production quality and the fact the board is basically a construction paper sheet - I think you can get a real board as an upgrade now.  An upgrade!
In my mind, **Quantum** feels quite unique. Being able to reconfigure your ship is really fun!
From my collection:

**Alchemists**. It is extraordinary game because of various things: 1) combination of worker placement and deduction; 2) integrating app smoothly into the game; 3) the theme hits home with academia folks' publish or perish!

**Dungeon Petz**. The petz's needs and how to appease them are very unique and thematic.

**Mechs vs Minions** is very thematic; playing it is like playing a video game where you level up and everything. It also one-of-its-kind with regard to its production value and relatively low price. 

**Tales of Arabian Night**. Sure there are several other games which integrate story telling into the game but ToAN is *the* story game that rule them all. It's more of an experience than a game, tbh. 


Off the top of my head

**Captain Sonar**  
**Rampage / Terror in Meeple City**  
**Ugg-Tect**  
**Ice Cool**  
As a worker placement game I think **Dungeon Petz** certainly fits the "not like the others" criteria on both the theme and overall rule set. 

As for action point allowance/area influence I think **Luna** by Stefan Feld is pretty different, especially in its "theme."

**Blue Moon Legends** is also quite a different take on hand management. I especially like the switch in POV that the cards use, requiring players to read the card effects out loud.
Any game form Sierra madre games. Unique combination of education and games.

Leaving earth is also unique 
**String Railway** comes to mind. It's 30 minutes of ridiculous fun :)
Catacombs. Either it's the only dungeon crawler that involves flicking discs, or it's the only dexterity game that involves casting spells. 
**Five Tribes** is pretty unique mechanically, as far as I can tell. The mancala action is really abstract, but it is a really satisfying thing when you can make a move in a tricky way to set yourself up for a good follow up move by dropping the right meeples in the right places on your way to your current goal.

Also recently picked up **Snow Tails** and it's definitely the most unique racing game I have. You have to play cards to manipulate your sledge's drift and speed so you don't wreck but still cross the finish line first.

Chances are you'll never play with both sideboards. 

The sideboards are only used if you use the Ancient One whose set up instructions tell you to set up the sideboard, or if you draw the prologue card that tells you to set up the sideboard. Otherwise, you don't play with either sideboard.

To play with both, you would have to be playing with the Ancient One that needs one side board, and you drew the prologue that required the other. In that case, if you didn't feel like playing with both, you could easily redraw the prologue card.
[A COMC with 140 games in 1 year?](https://i.imgur.com/CUaR9HE.gifv)
As far as I love shelfies of board game collections... damn, you really need to think about this as a problem. 140 products within 1 year makes over 10 games per month. You technically buy a game every 3rd day. That's a lot man. All is fine if you have the money for it. "Everything is for the people" as we say in Poland but still... makes me think.
My sons and I used to play a ton of Cave Troll.  I have fond memories of that one and might have to get it out again soon.  




Ha, I see Mecanisburgo in there! That game is batshit crazy. 

Wow, Ferox as well? That would be a nutty weekend






Sounds like you're brand-spankin'-new to the hobby. Firstly, you should check the sidebar for all important things. Also, be sure to check out [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/), which is basically the central hub of all things board games.


Difficult to recommend anything based solely on what you've given, but [checking the recommendations for new folks on the sidebar is a great place to start](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig).
**Codenames** is a party game but don't let fool you, for its price, you're getting a really good game!


No problem man.  If you like the idea of Risk have a look at Kemet or Cyclades or even Game of Thrones,all of which are better modern versions of the same "dudes on a map" idea.
Sounds like a new gamer to me! :D

First off, you say you want a complex or skilled game and then mention Risk. While a great piece of history, Risk is about as simple a game as you can play. It's also really unfun compared to some newer options! So, if youre new to board games, be careful asking for really complex ones because that hole goes very deep lol

[Here is the Dice Tower's list of great gift games for the holidays.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOlRvTbmD6tJjiE4kNbm4yFwOn7NmX6eM) That will be a great place to start! 
If you think Risk sounds great but don't like luck/dice, you can't go wrong with **SmallWorld**. Give it a shot :). 

Like others here I'd say that, while very famous, Risk is *not* a very good game, and boardgames have evolved since Risk's conception. Risk is not a complex game by modern standards. Just be conscious of this when you go shopping. There are some really complex games out there! 

You could ofcourse love them (I sure did when I discovered there is more than Monopoly/Risk/Catan in the world), but perhaps try before you buy? :)
[BANG!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143741/bang-dice-game)

There, I shot you
I would recommend **Lords of the Waterdeep** + expansion. Its hard to miss with that one.
I would start with **Ticket To Ride** or **Carcassonne.** Both are fun and pretty easy to pick up.
Risk 2210 or Game of thrones board game if you like the theme 
I would also like to mention that board games in general are more **expensive** than you think. Those mass market, *classic* games you know are about $20. Newer board games are gonna cost $30+ usually. 

It's also going to take a few months to figure out what you like, since you are new. I would recommend some great "lighter"(not as complex) games for you would be. Any of these would be a good starting point and they're all great fun

**Ticket to Ride**

**Catan**

**The Resistance**(Dystopian theme)/**Avalon** for the king arthur theme

**Codenames**

**Lords of Waterdeep**/**Champions of midgard**

**El Grande**(risk like, in that its an area control game)



Another important factor is that you said "i want to get some boardgames for the family and friends" then proceeded to "I love complex or skilled games".

You don't give gifts that are what YOU like, but what the giftee will like. This is a very hard lesson to learn with board games as there is a huge range of available games. Dominant Species may be one of my favorite games, but it would be a TERRIBLE gift for a family member. 

For family members, I would highly recommend Splendor, Bohnanza, CV, Carcassonne and Qwirkle. 

The games I am gifting to family this holiday are:
Las Vegas
Unusual Suspects
Castles of Mad King Ludwig
Dr. Eureka
Click Clack Lumberjack
Rhino Hero
Zany Penguins
Deception: Murder in Hong Kong
CVlizations

I've done a fair amount of research on these but haven't played them yet. But the primary factor in each was what the recipient would enjoy most, not what I would enjoy most. 


Ps: for anyone concerned, none of my recipients reddit, so no danger in posting the list. 




I absolutely love cosmic encounter. I had a group I played it with relentlessly but when playing with other game groups it always seems to fall flat. So flat that I am on the brink of selling my copy. I attribute it to new comers just not properly understanding how inviting everyone benefits you more then them, even if I try to explain that. With myfirst group we played it enough to understand how the game works in that way. These days it's jusy the one and done play mentality.
Maybe just play something else for a while, or don't play ce when that outside friend is there?   Looking for similar games won't help with that, need something different to cleanse the palate
They said in the latest email that there is a wait list.  So, if you want to be added to it, you should probably shoot them an email. 
I would be interested in this too
Great start.

Looks like you could stand to thin your paints further than you currently are (this is essentially the main issue all beginner painters have).

Beyond that, watch and read lots of painting tutorials to expand the range of techniques at your disposal.

Beyond that, subscribe to /r/minipainting for a near endless source of advice from a pretty positive community.
Great job!  I'm hoping to try this out soon with my mice and mystics figures. 
My goodness... the patience and time you need to paint. My respect.
If that's your first attempt, you're good to go. Watch your skill continue to increase over time. I look forward to seeing a post from you months from now. 
Chaos in the old world
Cyclades
Cosmic Encounters


You listed quite a broad range of games so it might be helpful to try to further specify what it is that you like about the games. That being said, here are a few suggestions:

**K2** - Mountaineering. Haven't tried the expansion yet but I think it would make it even better.

**8 minute empire: legends** - small area control game

**Cutthroat Caverns** - Fun semi-coop with a little bit of backstabbing.



Some of these are only 2-4, but I'd recommend any of them for your group:

https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/tasman001
Scythe 
Tyrants of the Underdark
Eclipse, Roll for the Galaxy
I was expecting more.  I heard hype coming from BGGcon.  But after this review, it's a hard pass for me.
Looks fun. I might pick it up at some point. I'll definitely try to play it if given the opportunity.
https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5fbn9m/what_are_your_completely_popular_board_game/
This same question was posted 5 hours ago...
seems like a fine collection. 

I guess you like medium length ~2 hour euro's or small conflict games. 

I'm guessing you find games like Game of thrones 2nd ed, eclipse or civilization, a bit more 4x or slightly longer games last too long? Otherwise you might want to try one of those. 

Also you don't seem to have any traitor game, could be nice to mix it up. Resistance, secret hitler, dead of winter, battlestar galactica, whichever you like. Some people hate this category but i think it's nice to mix it up. 

Generally I find it really difficult to suggest people games based on their list though. (in general this sort of problem is quite difficult, netflix have spend tons to improve their suggestion algorithm and most people can agree it gives ludicrous suggestions often). 

For example when I look at your list I don't really see anything coherent what you like. Medium weight, medium length, a bit more theme and looks and some interaction i suppose but so many games fit that. El grande,  power grid, brass, tzolkin, keyflower, terraforming mars, orleans, concordia, viticulture, kemet, mombasa, nations, village.. these all might be games you might like.. no idea though. If you really want more insightful help you need to tell why you like some games and perhaps make a bgg profile with all your games (also those you don't own) rated. 
Betrayal stored on its side? Risky
it is beautiful
Nice!

I especially like the display case for the X-Wing minis.  I tried to get something similar past the wife but failed my Persuade roll... :-(
nice collection!
Nice collection!  X-wing minis too!  Love it!
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12493/twilight-imperium-third-edition
Scythe, Terra mystica,  Caverna, and Keyflower are some of our favorites to play. We also recently picked up blood rage and find it interesting. Pandemic legacy I personally cant stand, our group is at 8 months and I don't see us finishing it any time soon. Is Champions of Midgard too simple? I wouuld suggest trying out The Gallerist if you want a heavy game with beautiful components. I am interested in looking into 51st state
Looks like we have a fair amount of overlap in our favorite games. I'm interested to hear more about **Lost Valley**. 

I own it but haven't played it yet. Perhaps it's time to push it to the front of the playlist. 
Hey, A couple of friends and I are going through the top 200 games we have access to on BBG. We play them, then we each rate that single experience out of five and end up with a running order of games we have played. We still have some pretty significant gaps in our list (scythe, blood rage ect) but here are our top games that we collectively gave a rating of 5.7 or higher. I know some of these are games you own (and others you have probably tried) but I just want to give you a perspective... that way you know what kinds of games we like. Anyway, here it is. Hope this helps: Castles of Burgundy,
Eclipse,
Codenames,
Power Grid,
Shogun,
Die Macher,
Terra Mystica,
Through the Ages,
Caylus,
Galaxy Trucker,
Tigris & Euphrates,
Samurai.
Awesome collection! I would highly recommend Cosmic Encounters to be added, it's my #1 for sure. 
You have a fine collection! I see a few there that i would love to own. I like the way your X-Wing Miniatures are displayed
What stands out as missing (probably because I just got it) is **Terraforming Mars**. 

Other games you might like and I don't see: **Orleans**, **Mombasa**. 
Oh, I like the whole semi-profile thing. Nice collection, too. I love the glass case thing. Have something similar for my X-Wings, as well.
So beautiful! My collection is one or two games off from yours but I have not figured out  the best way to store and display them yet. This is a marvelous idea
What was your experience with isle of skye?
Anyway thats like an average of 5 games a month, sad with envy haha
Im trying to limit myself to 6 or so games a year now 
Awesome collection and love the star wars mini figurines! Recently got [bloc by bloc](http://outofordergames.com/blocbybloc/) and i'm a huge fan. Games last around ~2 hours. I recommend it but i'm relatively new to the hobby. I'd describe it as similar in play to pandemic but with a variable board. 
What are your thoughts on Caverna?
He just blasted right into the factions goals; he should start a little lighter, with broad strokes describing the game's board and mechanics. Eventually getting to the nitty gritty when it seems natural. Also, show us some visuals, the board, cards, whatever so people have an idea of what he's talking about. Anyway, good luck to him!
Hero Quest!
Yours looks in great condition.... my brother found our copy and the expansions from home late last year.
I kind of repeat myself here, but thank you for your great work with this list every week!


The [**Mythic Battles: Pantheon**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/806316071/mythic-battles-pantheon/description/) is ending soon and I will miss this campaign. The community they have been able to build up, thanks to the way they are communicating with live streams and answering questions in the comment section for 12+ hours per day, is very impressive.


To me, the gameplay looks easy to learn and teach others and quick enough so you do not get much downtime. It is cool they have have added scenarios that allows both *co-op and solo play*, something I think they should have added from the start of the campaign as that can be a deal breaker for many.


The models are so beautiful and I do like how a normal 32mm human looks so small next to some monsters and the Gods. And the Gods looks small when compared to the Titans!


Yesterday they revealed the last expansion: [**Rise of the Titans!**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/806316071/mythic-battles-pantheon/posts/1748458/). If painting huge monsters is a thing you enjoy, then you should really check that one out.


Oh, and with the [**Conan - Mythic Battles Crossover**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/806316071/mythic-battles-pantheon/posts/1743858/), the Conan fans can finally get their [winged ape](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/014/611/037/9353824c68bac984e2aa8dccbd42fb12_original.png?w=639&fit=max&v=1479748049&auto=format&lossless=true&s=f180c77421e0ed8af9a34dc7a872fc65/).


All in all, [**Mythic Battles: Pantheon**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/806316071/mythic-battles-pantheon/) is the game I am looking forward to the most right now of all the boardgames I have backed. Now to wait for one year...
What's the record for funds raised on a board game and what are the chances KD:M 1.5 breaks it?
Shuffle, roll, and give thanks for games and those you play them with.
Since both **Feudum** and **Vast: The Crystal Caverns** both will come to retail I'm thinking about dropping my **Feudum** pledge to get **Lisboa**. **Kingdom Death: Monster** looks amazing, but I could get at least five other games for 250$ plus 40$ shipping. Maybe I should get two copies of it and sell one.

Do you think there will still be people who would buy it once this Kickstarter is over?
Not sure if i should drop my Mythic Battle pledge as im now much more interested in KDM. I could get both but i don't know whether Mythic will actually be a fun game.
Only backing **Legends Untold** currently, with **Tiny Epic Quest** finishing a few hours ago. Really interesting card based RPG that is smashing its stretch goals and still has nearly 3 weeks to go. My only concern is they become too well funded and feel forced to produce endless stretch goals, which can be damaging for these smaller developers as their game escalates away from them! They seem to have a sensible thread on things at the moment though, with a story based campaign mode just having been unlocked.
I'm really interested in backing Vast: The Crystal Caverns after skipping the first Kickstarter. I'm kind of unsure of the complexity of explaining the game to other players, since everyone is doing a completely different thing. My main group plays a lot of heavy games, so it might not be a problem for them, but could be for newer gamers.
I only read these for the #lolwuts.  I'm glad to see someone's finally had the balls to make an offensive game.  We've really been waiting for that.
I noticed Vast: The Crystal Caverns gets a reprint tag. Shouldn't Kingdom Death: Monster then also get one?
I was very intersted in The Edge:Dawnfall, but then I switced to MB:P and wanted to get the Typhoon pledge. Now I've lowered it to get the core box + Titans expansion and I went for KD:M as my highest pledge. I just hope they stick with the core game being shipped on summer 2017.
Just my opinion, but doesnt **5minute dungeon** seems to be too light in gameplay? 

Granted the art is just awesome
Does anyone want to compare 5 minute dungeon to FUSE?
I wish I had the $250 to drop on KD:M. It looks amazing but I just can't. :-(
Thinking of getting a refund on my Dark Souls board game Kickstarter pledge because of KDM. Thoughts? 
I went in at the Satan's Lantern pledge because I've been blueballed by the amazing paint jobs on these models since 2012. I don't regret a thing.
Thanks /u/Zelbinian for the great work every week!

We are currently 120% funded on Kickstarter and ending our campaign in 72 hours. [Check us out here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/496908901/game-of-trolls-a-card-game-for-jerks-and-their-jer?ref=d6vy6t)

Thanks so much everyone for your support and love over the last few weeks. This was our first product/kickstarter and we are excited to bring laughter into people's lives :)


I'm interested in Vast (and Lisboa), but with Kingdom Death: Monster being available for pledges, I can't justify all of them.  I sold some stuff over the past few months to prep for the KDM KS and now that it's here ... I've pledged for the $300 level, but we'll see how I feel as the campaign nears it's end.  That's a LOT of money for a game, especially when my shelf is already full of stuff I know I like.  
What absolutely kills me about Kingdom Death is the 2020 release date. I'm new to this hobby and the idea of dropping $300 on a single game is daunting... but I could be convinced if the game is worth it (which, everything I've read says it is)

But spending that kind of cash for a game I won't have for 3 years seems ridiculous. :(

edit: appears I need to read more lol. Thanks y'all
Tiny Epic Quest has copied so much of its style from the Zelda franchise, I would think it won't be long before they get contacted by Nintendo's lawyers to change their artwork or get sued.  Pretty ballsy of them. 
[Mice & Mystics](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124708/mice-and-mystics) sounds perfect. It's a dungeon crawling RPG aimed at a younger audience and entry level gamers, but still enjoyable for everyone else. The evil is controlled by the game, too, so you y'all can enjoy conquering it together.
You won't find anyone recommending monopoly in here. Also: Pretty much all our games are nerdy. No need to define a game as nerdy. They're all nerdy and you sound like one of us. Welcome.
**Betrayal at House on the Hill** might be a good fit. Basically it's about a bunch of people exploring a haunted house. In mid-game (most likely) someone will become a traitor. 

*Note that there's a new expansion just out - Widow's Walk. I heard good things about it too*
You might look at some of the D&D board games like [Castle Ravenloft](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/59946/dungeons-dragons-castle-ravenloft-board-game) or [Wrath of Ashardalon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/66356/dungeons-dragons-wrath-ashardalon-board-game) or [Legend of Drizzit](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91872/dungeons-dragons-legend-drizzt-board-game).

You might also look at something like [Descent 2nd ed](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104162/descent-journeys-dark-second-edition) or if Star Wars is an acceptable theme, then the reimplementation of the Descent system, [Imperial Assault](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164153/star-wars-imperial-assault).

The D&D games are fully cooperative while the Descent games are "1-vs-many," meaning one player will play the bad guys while the rest of the players play the heroes. 

EDIT: Forgot to say, all these games are super "nerdy." ;)
Settlers of Catan may be going mainstream but is really good.  I really like Castle Panic due to its cooperative ruleset.
Maybe Marvel Legendary?  It is co-op against evil villains,  so sounds like "playing with my sons against the evil". 
Hey, shout out to a fellow ElfQuest fan! I almost never see another one in the wild. By the way, there was an Elf Quest game on Kickstarter a while back. I got it. It's terrible. :)

As I have been for many people looking at this category of games lately, I highly recommend the new Conan game. Not only is it the most fun hack and slash game out there, it works for a smaller number of players since one person can play many heroes easily. I think Conan is sufficiently nerdy. Plus, you and your son could spend time painting the miniatures together. I would definitely give it a look as it sounds like what you may be looking for. 
All the suggestions are great. 

I'd like to mention **Lords of Waterdeep**. Great worker placement game with a thin D&D theme. Your wife will even love this one. My wife hates dungeons and dragons and fantasy, and she really likes this one. 

If you get the base game and like it, definitely look into the expansion 
When I have kids, I'm gonna be just like you :D

You should definitely check the **Zombicide** series and especially the last edition, **Black Plague**. Easy to play and so much fun. It works great with 2 or 3 players.

Also, I'm surprised nobody suggested **Pandemic**. I never really liked it, but lots of people do. There's also a lot of different editions theme wise for this one (the coolest for me being **Reign of Cthulhu**).

The upcoming Masmorra (released jan 2017 I think) which is a dungeon crawler och Arcadia Quest (already out, sequel coming soon) which is a dungeon campaign game maybe? The latter has received tons of praise and it's packaged in a way that makes it accessible to children while still being plenty nerdy. Masmorra has the same design so it shares the same graphical appeal as well.
Boss Monster would be a good one to get.  You create dungeons to trap the "hero". Cards all done with 8-bit style artwork.  
Talisman and Runebound are great for your older son. 

If you want to include the younger, try Treasure Hunter, Castle Panic, and Dragonwood. He's a little young yet but could play on a 'team' with someone older.
If you can live with playing one-vs-many (I.e. you being the DM) after all, I would also recommend Catacombs 3rd edition. 

It's a classic dungeon crawler, however, instead of rolling dice or consulting tables to move and attack, you simply flick wooden disks across the board. 

(For example: wanna do a melee attack? Flick your character and every monster that they hit takes a damage. You're the elf and want to do your special move? First flick your character to position yourself, then place a tiny arrow disk next to yourself and attack with that.)
For your younger one (in a few years) Jamaica might be good and will hold your and the older ones attention.

It's a boat racing game of pirates booty and broadsides
As recommended earlier on this thread, Mice and Mystics is a great fit IMO. I'm not sure how much you're into worker placement games, but Lords of Waterdeep is a really fun and fantasy themed game to play. If you can, I'd recommend getting the expansion as well, since it adds a lot of missing functionality to the game. It will be too heavy for a 3 year old to understand, but I'm sure you could have some fun with it. You also get to screw people over with intrigues, which never gets old. 
I'm in the same boat as you but 10 years younger so my only child is 2 but that's not stopped me looking. I'm looking at massive darkness, same people who do zombicide. More rpg elements and a little more of a dungeon crawl. Not out yet until next year, kickstarter is over but you might be able to contact cmon for a pledge. Lots of loot and cool looking miniatures. I'm also getting dark light memento mori but that's for me and friends. Might be be a bit too complicated and disturbing , theme wise.
You should also check out www.boardgamegeek.com

The classic starter games are settlers of Catan, ticket to ride, Carcassonne.  All are great and nerdy but not in the d&d theme.

For d&d type games. Talisman, lords of water deep, wiz war, ascension.
Take a look at Plaid hat Games' "Mice and Mystics" it's a great cooperative fantasy dungeon crawler with a great narritive where the players play against the board.
Catan is a game we just got not too long ago, and it is great.

E: okay, so basically, it is similar to the civilization games in board structure. It has a certain number of hexagons with different resources (brick wood stone and hay) that you use to build towns and cities. At the end of each turn, you may offer a trade to everyone (Eg. I have hay if anyone will give me bricks) to get resources you need. The game is over when you get a certain number of victory points. BTW how you get resources is that if you have a town on any one hexagon, and someone rolls the number associated with the hexagon, you get those resources.

E2: There are also quite a few expansions you can buy that shake up the game quite a bit.
Zombicide: Black Plague. My teenager loves it.
I'm going to go against the consensus and say DON'T get Mice and Mystics. It's very simplistic, with not much actual "game" to it. The miniatures are cute, but there are virtually no meaningful decisions, and your 13 year old will get bored of it quickly. If you just want to roll dice there are better games. I also found the story (one of the major selling points of the game) to be pretty poorly written and cliche. 

Descent 2e is a much better option (and the app makes it a pure co-op) if you want a dungeon crawler. Another good one is Shadows of Brimstone- dungeon crawler with an old west meets magic theme. A few parts of the game are a little wonky/unbalanced, but that matters less in a fully co-op game, and it gets my vote in spite of that because it's just ridiculously fun.
Here are my lists according to *BGG*:

Overrated: Countless

Underrated: Abyss, Broom Service, Covert, Imhotep, Pandemic: The Cure, Tobago. Sure, these have gotten some hype, but not nearly enough for how awesome they are.
from what i understand they don't start processing and shipping until this week.
I only have IA from that list. One thing to note about it is that it only accommodates a maximum of 5 players. It is played as 1v4 ideally. Other than that is borrows a lot of its gameplay from descent. 

P.S. Watch the SUSD videos on IA and Descent if you haven't already

EDIT: Added postscript
some others (all co op)

shadows of brimstone -full co-op, lots of minis and dice rolling, persitent characters with light rpg system between missions. Cthulu/ western theme Plays up to 6

warhammer quest silver tower - very scaled down dungeon crawler, lots of hero choices but rng character development. Excellent minis, solid rule set and shortish play time. Set in age of sigmar. Plays 4

Mansions of madness - not technically a dungeon crawler but very similar. App driven, rpg feel full co-op "mansion/ town Crawl". Cthulu based (and in my top 3 this year) . Plays up to 5

The undercity - privateer press. Persitent characters set in the warmachine universe. Board is a bit meh but solid rule set, plenty of minis and each character has a different feel. Plays 4

Myth - beast of a game with an awful 1.0 rule set. That said the latest 2.0 rules which are on the website are pretty good but does mean self printing a lot of cards if you can only find the old edition. free form adventuring, some character development but  excellent boss mechanics. Plays up to 5

Zombicide black plague - medevial dungeon crawl. all one off sessions but good fun. nice step up from most gateway style games. excellent theme. Plays up to 6.
I have Mice and Mystics. It's a great game. A fun, narrative RPG, but I'm pretty sure it only goes up to 4 players.

You could also look into Zombicide Black Plague. I think it supports up to 6 players normally, but BGG says it goes up to 12 (but is best with 6). It has an apocalyptic medieval setting and plenty of additional content, both official and homebrew.

There are also a few games coming out that you could look into getting (through pledging/late pledging on Kickstarter or otherwise). For example: Massive Darkness, Endure the Stars, Deep Madness, Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress, or Siege of the Citadel.
Hey, Descent is great, especially if you are wanting a dungeon crawler campaign. It is more complex than most of your games though. Mice and Mystics is a much simpler game but works on similar mechanics.  Vast just came out and is a wild game that seems to be doing well on BBG. It does not have campaign mode. I have also played dungeon roll. It's a 5 minute filler dungeon crawler game that comes in a chest, it's pretty neat. As a side note... looking at the type of games you seem to like, Cosmic Encounter is a pretty awesome game. 
I really tried to like Descent. I played it for about 20 hours. I could never get into it, and my friends couldn't really either. It just feels restrictive and artificial, with no strong theme to hold it together. It always felt like the heroes were getting in each other's way. 

Conan, by contrast, is a new favorite of my group. We've played about 8 times in the month since I got it. It feels open and free. Players can take as many actions as they want, assuming they have the energy. And in any order. And there's no grid, so you aren't trying to get around each other. It's just fun. And you aren't checking the rules all the time like we did with Descent. 

I highly recommend Conan over Descent or it's clones like Imperial Assault. Especially over the long term since all of us are already excited to create our own scenarios and campaigns like we did in the 90's with Heroquest.  
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/poots/kingdom-death-monster-15/

Take a quick gander at this before deciding. Core game ships out in summer of 2017.

Gameplay can be seen by a variety of people on Youtube. If it seems to dark or hardcore for your guys, probably try Descent.
Descent 2e is great if you are looking for a "classic" dungeon crawler. Normal fantasy tropes- lots of monsters, campaigns with character levelling, all round solid fun game. Imperial Assault is the same game basically but with a Star Wars theme, if that's your preference; both good games, but probably not worth owning both.



Shadows of Brimstone is a "weird west" setting which is different. 100% co-op, has a mechanic that randomly generates the dungeon as you explore. Interesting character progression which makes you want to keep playing. Some wonky mechanics, but is the most fun dungeon-crawler type game I've played, ever, hands down.



Mice and Mystics. Bleh. Roll to move, roll to attack, few meaningful decisions, you don't really level your characters from game to game. Cute miniatures are good. Story is not well written, but is adequate I guess. My 9 year old has outgrown the game. One of only two games I regret buying.


Oh my. You are missing the best, then: Shadows of Brimstone.
Aside from this awesome title, Conan has serious issues of game balance and rules; Mice and Mystics is a splendid game but somehow "un-epic"; Descent... you can play it solo with an app, but IA is way much better. IA is the second best after Shadows of Brimstone. 
You can also think about Dungeons & Dragons Fantasy Adventure (oop but easily found used or on eBay at affordable prices), or the Dungeons & Dragons boardgame series (I would suggest Temple of Elemental Evil box, still the best of the four published).
But beware: all these titles won't work with 6 players, except the awesome Shadows of Brimstone, that can work with up to 8 players, and can be played solo, as well.
Good evening geeks, here's my new Dice Hard video in which I take a look at Lords of Vegas from Mayfair Games. Have many of you played this, if so what do you think? What's your favourite game with a Vegas theme?
This is one of my favorite games. To me it's Monopoly for the modern age. Good bit of capitalism, luck, and meanness against your neighbor.
This is my favorite game!  I love how tactical it is.  You can try a strategy, but things can change so much between turns you have to fly by the seat of your pants.  
Absolutely one of my favourite games. I keep discovering ways to be mean. My most recent evil deed saw me trade my 6 pip die in a large casino to someone who had a green tile I wanted (there were none left) so I could build it elsewhere to make that casino bigger. Soon as I did that I turned around and rerolled that die I sold them with my other dice and took back control of that casino.

Except I didn't...their single die came up 6 and my 3 dice came up 4. Still, I loved the move.

Love this game.
I had to pull out because I was already worried with the fact that people had such trouble getting their stuff from the first kickstarter, and the fact that they were stuck ~700k for a long time while MBP was killing it. I'm glad to see it finally gaining some traction, hope you guys get the dragon unlocked, and that expanded town at 1300 looks cool too. Good luck!
I have it set to watch,  but I really doubt I'm going to jump on it.  

While I liked the first,  the feudal Japanese theme isnt my thing.  And the fact it would thematically clash with the other core sets...  Makes it a turn off. Which is sad because I like the other world concept.  

Also,  KDM has reared its head, and unlike sob,  I know I will never see that core game or expansions for cheaper. 
I see **Lords of Waterdeep** hasn't been mentioned yet. Personally, I have found more success with it than Stone Age with groups that have similar tastes to yours. 
Blue orange recently started a new family line of games and new York 1901 fits this bill. Also haba did the same and karuba is the same level for me. 

Haba's new game meduris *seems* to be this weight also but i haven't played it. 

There are loads of great games in this weight though.  
I would go with **Carcassonne**, **Five Tribes** and **Mr. Jack Pocket**. Also if you are a fan of Ticket to Ride with two players and have not picked up the **Switzerland Map Pack**, I would highly recommend it, as it is tighter and more competitive for 2 players. 
**7 Wonders**, **Carcassonne**, and **Stone Age** all fit your criteria very well. Also, I *highly* recommend **Escape**.
**Five Tribes** is one of my favorite games to play at 2 and we just got the Artisans expansion and it is amazing. There's so much to think about, but you eventually build an intuition about where certain numbers on a tile can reach and the changes you're making to the board and how that effects your opponents play and your bidding next round. Then you start figuring out the intricacies of bidding and the relative power of all the various scoring metrics. It's a really fun game with a ton of life to it and I'd call it the best Days of Wonder game so far.
Five Tribes and Royals come to mind.
Quadropolis
7 Wonders is one of my favourite board games, but I feel that it is quite bad with 2 players. Lords of Waterdeep is very good at 2 and more players. I would also consider taking a look at Scythe or Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition. The app is really helpful and turns the game into a complete co-op strategy game.



Second Carcassonne--fantastic with two, but scales up well, and hugely expandable if you're so inclined.
Check out Quadropolis.  It's a city building game that scales from 2 - 4. We skipped right over the basic game and played the advanced variant.
I had a ton of fun with Lanterns this weekend. I'm not sure how it plays with 2, but it fits your simple to learn mechanics with strategy. Also it doesn't look like you have a tile laying game and Lanterns fits that niche.
**Lords of Waterdeep** and **Carcassonne** are 2 games I highly recommend for you.
Anything on my [gateway shelf.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/59lcp6/comc_curated_shelf_of_gateways/)
Great suggestions. I have gone with Carcassonne for now as I played a bit online and I like it – the setup is also non-existent which is always a bonus!

Lord of Waterdeep and Five Tribes are on my 'to get next' list for sure!
Nice job. Really wished more games handled this aspect of the games better.
I'd love to see this again after you have added some expansions!
Great idea. Love the art!!!
I'm looking for some more two player games for me and my wife, is this a good option? She loves Pandemic.
I'd love to see this again after you have added some expansions!
Here you go! It works like a charm!

http://www.pubmeeple.com/introducing-board-game-ranking-engine/

Just tried it with about 100 games, which worked out to about 600 comparisons, but it went pretty fast and was fun. (The number of comparisons should scale like N*log N, where N is the number of games.)

Let me get you started. 

Worst: Munchkin
That's actually a really interesting project.

I'd go about it in an entirely different way... Hmm I may note this down and have a crack and if happy with results feedback here.
I actually made that for android last week as a little toy project. It is rally odd to find the exact use case mentioned here :) It currently just sorts lines of text based on your choices. If the interest is there I can polish it off and publish it
You need a "$0" joi option for how much you spend. 

For example, my friends and I only go to board game cafes because that's where our d&d meetup groups are held. 
I don't include expansion content. Multiple versions of timeline i would count as just timeline. 
Maybe since you have lots of small quick games, you should categorize your game collection by square foot?  Or, really get out of the box and do it by weight.  "How many games do you have?""**200 pounds.**""
I think the size of the games in your collection and the number of games in your collection are two completely separate metrics with no correlation to each other. You can use one or the other (though I've yet to see anyone make a claim akin to my collection is 100 cubic feet) but you definitely should not be mixing the two.

With that said, I think that it is perfectly acceptable to only count base games and not count expansions or variants. This can be an easy line to draw when the expansion/variant requires the base game to play, but does become a bit subjective when they're stand alone. You kind of just have to wing it at that point, but it is definitely something I do when counting my games.
When people ask I just tell them the number of base games I have (71) - that means that some games like **Dixit** and **Dixit Odyssey** get counted "twice" - which is fine because when I log a play for one or the other, it feels like a different game (one for 4-6 players and the other for 7+ players).

I don't count pure expansions though which makes the count balloon up to (180+) with all my **Age of Steam** expansions and the dozens of freebies I've gotten from my subscriptions to *Spielbox* and *Plato* magazines.

If you're really concerned about it, use *BGG* and just filter out expansions and that'll be your number - you don't have to feel like you're cheating or whatever kind of psychological hangup you have - just report it.
How about using an approximation based on MSRP? PnP would use printing/labor costs. That way you can lump small games together, and still factor in expansions (which also tend to be smaller in both physical space requirements and in terms of impact on the wallet).
I list all my games and expansions on BGG. I DON'T however list promos or break down my big box games into multiple listings. I know someone that does this to artificially inflate their collection. But in the end it doesn't really matter. It's how it's most useful to you, it's your way to keep track of information. 
I don't count expansions as separate games. I do count little card games, like **Love Letter**. So your right, it makes my collection of almost everything for **Sentinels of the Multiverse** take up more room then like 20+ smaller games. But I don't really see how that matters.
Nothing I really wanted. I guess Blood Rage and Mansions of Madness can be good pickups for some people.
5 Million deals on toys and magic cards....2 decent deals on board games....sigh.
As someone who has Amazon Prime. The Deals here aren't too different from Amazon. Blood Rage and Mansions of Madness are a tad bit lower, but I would wait for reprint to see what happens.
Check out Quantum! Dice pips act as attack / movement / special move / conquer the planets by having all your pips equal the number printed on that planet, all on a modular board with high strategy.
Santorini, should be coming soon, is really awesome!
Hanabi... down right fantastic 2-5 player cooperative card game.  
I spotted "Stac" on /r/abstractgames too which looks fun, too.
You might enjoy some of the following

- quadropolis

- Völuspá

- Legacy the testament of the Duke deCracy

- summoner wars

- hive

- karuba

- gold west

- scoville

- harbour

- the Manhattan project 
**Patchwork**, as mentioned, is a must-have for two players. Coming in very close behind it is **Jaipur**. Both of these have a degree of luck but are mainly strategy games. It's possible to lose a game of Jaipur due to bad luck, however, but it's a speedy game so you can play best of three or five to mitigate that.
I see the majority of games you enjoy are on the American side of board games (no judgment, most of my collection is Ameritrash), but perhaps a solid but mostly simple Euro like The Castles of Burgundy is up your alley? It definitely plays best with 2-3.

Other possible games:

Galaxy Trucker: unlike anything on your list. It's heaps of fun and you can mitigate a lot of the luck by looking at mission cards and competent ship building. If you're not up to watching something you built be (humorously) destroyed by the hazards of space, this is probably not your game.

Ghost Stories: a solid co-op game that's definitely tough and worth revisiting numerous times. And that's on the easy setting. Though once you get used to it you can up the difficulty as you see fit.

Paperback: aka Dominion meets Scrabble. It plays competitively and co-operatively.

Pandemic Legacy Season 1: You can generally find it for under $50 and it's definitely worth the experience in my opinion. The downside being that once you've played it 12-24 times (realistically 16-18) you've completed the story and can no longer play it. 

Patchwork: a solid 2 player game.

Quantum: my girlfriend and I enjoy this as a 2-player game, but I think it gets even better with 3-4 people.

Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective: as recommended by others here.

But definitely watch YouTube videos of all recommended games before purchasing it. I'm partial to Shut Up & Sit Down as reviewers.

Happy gaming!
Summoner wars is my favorite 2-player game. You can start with the Master Set which gives you quite a few races.  

http://www.plaidhatgames.com/store/14

That's how I started it and really got into it.  

There is luck with rolling dice for attacking but you are always trying to increase your odds by attacking with powerful characters or using special event cards to mitigate luck.  I play it quite regularly with a friend and it's still fun every time.  It's been called a mix of chess and magic the gathering without the insane complexity of either.
You can never go wrong with Le Havre.
Maybe Aeon's End? 
You should take a look at **Mexica**. One of my favorites, and it's just gotten a gorgeous reprint with heavy resin temples this last year. Great for up to 4, at two there are some dummy buildings placed randomly on the board, but not a dummy player per se -- I think it works quite well. Games can go faster than an hour, but there is potential for AP given your potential six actions per turn, especially in the early game when the board is wide open.
I recommend Pandemic and Sherlock holmes consulting detective..
Mr Jack, Patchwork, and Samurai, are all great two player games that are played in 30 minutes or under (or pretty close to).
The beauty of Wits and Wagers is that you don't actually need to know a lot of random trivia to do well or have fun. Say the question is 'How many pounds of potatoes does the average American eat per year?' Being American doesn't help you in this instance (unless you somehow know this useless fact). Doing well is based on how you bet, thinking who else *might* know the answer, putting down a low number just so no one can get the 6 to 1 odds, etc.
There's several questions that are US-centric, and many questions that are American sports-centric - about NFL football, basketball, and I think even some baseball.  So while I agree with the other commenter that W&W doesn't require knowledge per se, it's not a lot of fun when you have absolutely no idea about what's being asked.  I think you certainly could play, but have a question veto option if your players don't know anything about American sports.
It's an epic storytelling miniature board game that is not dungeon crawler. Very high entry fee and complicated system. Incredible yet controversial artwork. A board game for mid-hardcore gamer in my opinion.
My brother in-law funded it at the $1666 level. I'm having trouble seeing the value compared to D&D. Miniatures, in my opinion, add nothing to the game play so it's a waste on that front. 

I'm just not seeing how the rest of the game could surpass 40 years of D&D fine tuning, expansions, resources, and cost efficiency. 
Cheers for the folks answering, I just saw it on Kickstarter with $5m+ in 5 days but I'd seen 0 news or information about it before hand and didn't really get where the craze was coming from...

And thanks to the folks who just downvote people asking actual questions! So much help!
Well, to some people (me included) it is the boardgame to rule them all (assuming you like the gameplay). If you own it, you probably don't need other games since you're going to want to keep playing that. 

The game is almost flawless on so many levels : 

 - Miniature quality & details are unmatched
 - The art, lore and setting are really good (yes, THAT good) if you are into really dark and creepy stuff
 - the various phases of gameplay are very good, blend very well and complete each other very well

Hence why price is that high, you pay premium to get premium. If you have a gold bar burning a hole in your pocket I suggest grabbing the 250$ pledge, you would not believe how far that core box set can take you. 

Expansions are like getting a greenhouse for your mansion, you don't need that, your house is already so big you haven't seen all the rooms, but you just want some more. 

As for details regarding gameplay I am fairly sure someone already wrote a post while I was writing this one. 
So, for me and my wife, Kingdom Death Monster has been the most amazing game of the decade.  I am counting video games in that group btw.

We used to love D&D, but getting a consistent group together with a strong GM can be a nightmare.  As a result, we played Descent for a while, but we found that didn't have the strength of story of D&D, a really good campaign, and still needed someone to play a GM.

Still other games really lacked what we would call a fair challenge.

Kingdom Death is the ultimate "Rogue-like" game.  You have some control over what you hunt, but you never really know or can predict how things are really going to go.  The first couple times you play, you get your butt kicked severely, but each session results in more and more learnings and over time you get more and more successful.  Eventually, you reach a wall, then you have a breakthrough that completely changes how you play going forward, which helps you to progress even further.  Until the next wall, and on, and on, and on.

Now, add into that mix, over a dozen expansions that can be mixed and matched into the main game, multiple other campaign settings like People of the Stars and People of the Sun that dramatically change the entire feel of the settlements and your survivors; and you have a board game with an insane amount of replayability that never feels old or really repetitive.

Hope this helps.  If you want to learn more about any of the expansions, you can check out a few of our videos.  Also let us know if you have any questions.

Tabletopia or Tabletop Simulator. Some spacebucks outlay but you have the right environment to play games
Check out boardgamearena.com . They've got a bunch of games you can play, all in browser, works really well with a hangouts window side-by-side.
Why not use Tabletop simulator to play? It's basically a board game simulator (although much more), which is available on steam for around 20 dollars. It is much better than any online board game site IMO. It is really easy to set up and there's literally thousands of free games ready to play included.
Anything co-op is cool, like the good ol' **Pandemic** and **Forbidden Island/Desert**.

Not a board game, but check out **Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes** as well.
Kind of a table top game: the guys I play boardgames with also really like "keep talking and nobody explodes" We have played before from separate houses over skype. It adds a nice little thematic element when we are all separate. It's also nice since it only takes one person to purchase the game, everyone else can be on the paper side of things. 
Dominion online is pretty cool
Captain Sonar would work perfectly over Skype. Wouldn't play any different at all!
One game that Rodney from Watch It Played used to mention he liked to play online was Eminent Domain. He does have details on his channel about using 2 copies of the game to play and even some examples of it. 
I really enjoy **Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower** as a solo game. The miniatures are absolutely fantastic and the gameplay is very tactical and yet easy to grasp. 
If you're into zombies, there's always Zombicide Black Plague. It's an apocalyptic fantasy medieval setting with a boat load of miniatures. You can play it solo or with others cooperatively.

Mice and Mystics is also fantasy medieval and has plenty of cool miniatures. It's a narrative RPG and, again, can be played solo or co-op. The characters are mice, so that might not be something you're interested in, but it's a really fun game.

Edit: I should add that Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress is up on Kickstarter right now. It has a fantasy medieval Japanese theme and has some really killer minis. It's expensive though and not slated to ship until 2018.
The Dungeons and Dragons board games like **Wrath of Ashardalon** can be played solo. There are several others like **Elemental Evil**,  **Drizzt**, and **Ravenloft** but I don't know how the various ones rank against each other. 
You might also want to look in to **Sword & Sorcery** from Ares Games, and **Massive Darkness**.

However from what I've read you can easily play **Gloomhaven** solo and with friends.  All the quests are endlessly repeatable, so if you do a quest on your own it's not hard to do it with a group also.   However some of them have special rewards or cause an either/or choice be made which is part of the legacy component, so choices can't be remade and the chest that item was in is now empty.
You can run separate parties simultaneously in gloomhaven and both affect the world
I really like Descent 2e with the app. I've played some of the first campaign then started to move so I haven't gotten very far. 
I really recommend Galaxy Defenders, and maybe Sword and Sorcery. Definitely my favourite games to solo! Also play great with others 
Have take a look at **7th Continent** ?
The Walking Dead - All Out War is more of a 1v1 board game /skirmish game hybrid, but it has a very satisfying solo mode. It's very tactical and thematic. Zombicide - Black Plague, as mentioned above, is also good. 
Doubling on the zombie theme is accidental.
**Descent** I've played both campaigns and 1/2 of a Delve. I loved it. My wife and I also paint the minis. I highly recommend the app for solo play and the minis for painting.

**Shadows** I've played a couple of scenarios but the roll to move mechanic kinda kills it for me. The minis are sub par and must be assembled from sprues.

**Gloomhaven** I have not played it but after playing **Pandemic Legacy** I feel like a legacy game might best be shared with another.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/poots/kingdom-death-monster-15/

This game can be played solo. Ignore the misleading delivery time, that is for everything. Core game 1.5 delivers in Summer 2017.

Also: comes with GOBS of miniatures that you can build yourself to your own liking. See the armor kits decription.

There are descriptions and play views of the game on Youtube.
You might want to check out Advanced Song of Blades and Heroes. 

From the website:
Advanced Song of Blades and Heroes is the updated incarnation of the award-winning Song of Blades miniatures system.

Play fantasy skirmishes in any scale, with any models you already own.

With an expanded magic system, an exciting turn sequence, an optional setting, weapon rules, an open-source point system, and combat mechanics that keep players involved at all times, there is no limit to the epic stories you can create.


Arboretum a pretty neat strategy card game, if you draw it reccomends both (or all) players go out and plant a small tree, the one that has grown most after a year is the winner. It amused the life out of me and as such i love it. 
Blood Bowl: Team Manager has my favorite

>After the final tally, the manager with the most fans wins the game.

>If there is a tie for most fans, the tied manager who accumulated the most improvements wins the game.

>If there is still a tie, the Team Manager’s Union suspects foul play and conducts an investigation. The Team Managers' Union (TMU) suspends each suspected (tied) manager indefinitely, and they lose all their fans. The TMU presents the Manager of the Year award to the remaining manager who gained the most fans and that manager wins the game instead!

>If all managers are still tied (after checking for the most well-developed team), then the TMU loses all credibility, the fans revolt, and nobody wins the game!
I do love Arboretum's tie breaker.

Also a favourite is this final tie breaker from Thief's Market:

'If still tied, the first player to grab the start player marker and run from the room shouting “You fools! Muahahaha!” wins.'
I mostly prefer if a rule book simply just states that players share the tie. Unless there is some sort of substantial different between each players ending conditions which justifies a tie break. 

Although I like how Agricola does it. The rule book says something about, if you experience a tie, just play the game again to break the tie.
I like any tie breaker that has to do with the most important non-point scoring resource as it feels significant, but after the first tie breaker, I'd rather have a comedy tie-breaker (Arboretum-esque) or a shared victory. Beyond one tie breaker, it starts to feel kinda petty, like basing a win on something that doesn't matter. 
I think our least favorite was Suburbia's tie breaker.  The first game we had played of it had been kind of bland due to the point tiles making it very obvious which tiles to take/not to take.  We tied on points and read through the whole rules that stated, after the other tie breakers, that we'd have to play another game of Suburbia to break the tie.  We now often reference "play a game of suburbia" whenever anyone asks about what a game's tie breaking rules are.
Yeah.  We knew it wasn't serious and hat most people would probably actually just call it a full tie there, but the first game of it we played had point tiles out that made some of the hexes unwanted and neither of us would have wanted to play another game right after.  So while the actual worst tied rules probably fall to something with unclear resolutions, no thought about ties at all, or something arbitrary that also isn't fun (like earliest birthday or oldest player); Suburbia is he one that stands out because we realized that we definitely weren't in the mood for another game of it after the one we just played.
I say just let them tie.  It's supposed to be about fun more than anything.  
use padding, on all sides of the package (even underneath your item), imagine someone playing soccer with your parcel for a while. It should withstand that. 
Wrapping them as pairs in bubble wrap should do it. 
They make rolls of thin foam for packing dishes that is really cheap ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Pratt-Perforated-Dish-Thick-Every/dp/B00AI6DA0I)).  I would use that to individually wrap the figures (secure the foam with some tape), then pack them with a layer of paper/bubble wrap on top and on bottom of the figs to make sure they don't shake around in transit. 
It's possible to purchase the game directly from a South American retailer. If you pay via PayPal and sometimes even credit cards, they'll convert the currency for you automatically.
Fairy Tale seems like a good card drafting game.
In terms of pure drafting, **7 Wonders** is the go-to game.  It's similar to **Sushi Go**, which you said you have, in that the basic gameplay is that as you draft, cards get played, and you total points at the end of the round.  It's more complex than Sushi Go -- there are more varieties of cards and more choices about what kind of strategy to pursue -- but the basic gameplay is similar.

**Nevermore** has a different mechanic.  Start with five cards.  Pass (and get from your neighbor) 3 cards, then 2, then 1.  You'll end up with a hand of five cards.  There are five card types, and whoever has the most of a given type gets to take an action (for example, whoever has the most swords gets to damage another player, and whoever has the most hearts gets to heal).

Other games use drafting as one component of the game -- one that comes to mind is **Seasons**, which starts with a card draft (players draft the spells they will use during the game), and throughout the game, players draft dice that have been rolled, though the game has other, non-drafting mechanics.
I'll expand your horizons with two games that use drafting mechanics, but for which the draft is not the only part of the game:

**Steampunk Rally**: Each player is an inventor and each turn starts with a draft of machine part cards which may be installed into your contraption or discarded to gain power (dice) to fuel their contraption across the countryside in a race phase of the turn.

**Between Two Cities**: Players draft tiles, rather than cards, and use them to build two cities with the players to their left and right. At the end of the game each player's lower-scoring city counts as their final score, so players must balance and strategize on both sides.

Both are easy to learn and play well with larger groups.
Among the Stars is good, I like it. Tom Vasel once said it replaced 7 Wonders for him in one of their Top 10 videos, so I guess they're similar. Haven't played it.

If you want to play 2-players only, you could look at the Tides of Time/Tides of Madness games.

I have Nevermore (and the expansion) but haven't got it to the table yet. It seems really good, though (hence why I bought it).
You should put in more details. Which ones do you already own (I'm assuming none)? What are you looking for in the game (player count, duration, complexity, etc.)? What do you think of the more well know drafting games (7 Wonders, Sushi Go, etc.)?
7 wonders has at least one expansion that seems pretty good. Never more is another that is drafting, it has some interesting mechanics
Do you want a game that is drafting + play with your deck or do you want drafting where that is the game?

**Seasons** is my go-to recommendation for a excellent drafting game MTG-style. You will draft a deck and then play with it (while knowing a bit about the other players decks). It can play well even at 2 players.

**Among the Stars** is my personal favorite for pure drafting. However, it really is best played with 3-4. I also think 7 Wonders is best with lower player counts, but if i'm in the 3-4 player range count i'd always recommend Among The Stars over it. The expansions for Among the Stars add a lot to the game HOWEVER they greatly increase setup time since you don't just grab the decks shuffle and go.

**7 wonders** is my recommendation to support higher player counts. It's good to have in any collection for when you need a light game that supports 7 players (8 w/ Cities expansion).

**Sushi Go** if you want something super light and simple. It's too basic for my personal taste but I know a lot of people like it.
I like among the stars a lot. Terraforming Mars and blood rage also have great drafting mechanisms imo
Start with Dominion. From there you will know if card drafting is something you truly like.
I have the base game, factions, and Outer Belt. I never play them and would sell the lot for 100 plus shipping. I'm in the US.

It's a good game but not for $250. Although for dice placement I really recommend looking into **Voyages of Marco Polo**, my group traded away Alien Frontiers after playing VoMP.
There's a pretty good iPad app. I know this sounds crazy, but I have used it in person to play Alien Frontiers, since there is no hidden information in the game. It takes up very little room, and give you the opportunity to play without a physical copy... assuming you have a device that supports it...
it's selling for $54 on amazon

https://www.amazon.com/Game-Salute-330272-Frontiers-Edition/dp/B00TIR2M6Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1480281840&sr=1-1&keywords=alien+frontier
The Big Box KS is (finally) shipping soon. I assume there will probably be some in stores. It was $125, but it includes all the expansions. You might want to wait for that.
Just go by Vasel's Law: "If it's a good enough game, it will come back into print." You might have to wait awhile, but it will probably be back soon. I think the last run was a year ago or more, so I wouldn't be surprised if we saw it again soon. 

Also, if you must have it now, check more than Amazon. BGG market might be a better bet, or eBay.

This sub has a monthly B/S/T thread that is posted around the beginning of the month. Always has several hundred posts, and many many more views. I'd recommend (and have had good experiences with) posting games up there.
BGG has regional forums, if you live in a large enough area you might find some luck there. Otherwise, there is a tool to find trade partners, which will automatically find trades for items you have marked "for trade", and looking for items you have marked "want in trade". You can filter those results by location, bit only by state. I'm not sure how well the filter works if you're not in the US.
I've used Craigslist in the past. 
I'm not exactly sure, but it may be one way to mitigate quarterbacking.  Full info gives a potential quarterback all the info they need to dominate the game.  If that's not a problem with your group, then I'd drop it.

Also, it may help to speed the game along.  If you talk about all information on the cards, including the order of play and who you're going to give tokens to, etc, then it could really slow down the game.  So again not an issue if your group isn't collectively prone to AP.

On the other hand, you are getting attacked by friggin' Genestealers in front and behind you!  So are your squad mates! No time for chatter on fancy coordinated moves!  Attack! Support! Activeate the Control Panel! Oh no...what have I done!? Aaarggh!
It adds a layer of strategy I suppose, but I don't really understand it either. I think it's kind of a silly rule, personally.

LotR LCG has a similar rule concerning table talk where players cannot mention what cards are in their hand by name, but that wouldn't necessarily stop a group from coming up with euphemisms for said cards or what or communicating it in a non-direct way. 
It's to prevent one guy from puzzling out the optimal strategy and forcing the other player(s) to go with it. In practice, though, if you trust your group to be fair to each other and truly work together, you can just ignore this rule.
Thematically it makes sense because you are in diffetent room.
I just beat this three player last night. I imagine it would be tougher with 4.

If I get 2 of Bellatrix, Barty, or Dementor in first set of villians, I just shuffle (especially on a 4 player). I know I am going to lose so I don't bother wasting the time.

People like transfiguration to pull out a card when you really need it. I think your powers is a good set.

As far as clearing the hogwarts set, diluting early on isn't horrible. Almost every card is at least a little useful. There is an offical (From the creator) optional rule where once per game (not per player), a person will buy nothing and place all 6 cards on the bottom of the deck.

The key to the game is managing the 1st location. If you can keep skulls off you are golden. The second for year 7 is managing horcruxes; hopefully you get hogwarts a history so you can choose dice. Choosing when to go after them and when to stay on a horcrux is key. Last is I just shuffle if the villian deck is stupid. 
I don't have very many. I like Flick 'Em Up and Click Clack Lumberjack. I would like to get Catacombs and Ice Cool, though.
**Junk Art**

**Rhino Hero**
I play a lot of dexterity games, but crokinole is my favorite. 
**Crokinole** is expensive, but it's unquestionably the best.
Micro Mutants, Pirate's Blast!, Animal Upon Animal, Connect 4 Launchers
Garbage Day is my favorite! You're trying to avoid cleaning your room or taking out the trash so you'll be balancing cards on a plastic trashcan or forcing your friends to do the same. It's so much fun 
Stick Stack is really fun.  Simple to learn, but the slight randomness makes for some decision making.  This has easily been a popular party/dexterity game whenever I bring it out.

I got it at Target.
Pitch Car, Ascending Empires, Ala carte, Catacombs, Dungeon Fighter, Mord im Arosa.
It's not cheap but I do love pitchcar 
**Tumblin Dice** is a fun tiered dice rolling game. The games go so quick that you can play multi games in a short period of time.
Piratenbillard, and Ice Cool make it to the table a lot. 
Bullet Ball
I am personally a big fan of Cat Tower.
The only one I own is Catacombs and I think it's very good. Maybe a bit long but fun!
Villa Paleti
I am in a very similar position to you.  Here's what I ultimately decided for myself:

Kingdom Death Monster has already been released and is absolutely beloved by the people that have played it.  I was a little unsure about the hype since I believe when people make that significant of a financial investment, they are more prone to liking the game.  However, I have since had friends play it (that didn't purchase it themselves) and they loved the experience.

Dark Souls, on the other hand, hasn't released a rulebook and many details are still unclear.  Add to that that they have done some funny things with shipping and it is fair to say that we should be skeptical of the Kickstarter.

I made the decision to go for KDM, but I'm going to keep my fingers crossed for Dark Souls.  All of the bosses will be released at retail, so I will play the fully released game and, if it turns out the way I hope, invest in the mega bosses.  That was my logic and I hope it is helpful to you!
No one knows because Dark Souls isn't out. 
Did the math, 7 DS bosses is pretty much the price of KDM core set. Currency fluctuations may apply.

Anyhow, as someone who didn't bite on DS and backed KDM instead... based on your description it sounds like DS would be better. You're already committed, you're probably already aware of the current issues, and the DS bosses minis are things you definitely won't regret acquiring. Are you fine paying $250 just for the 7 minis? It looks like you are.

On the other hand, KDM doesn't sound like something you're really invested in yet. Not to the degree that you are in DS. So, let me break down your options:

1. Get DS bosses.
2. Get KDM.
3. Get both (eventually).

It seems to me that if you're limited to choices one and two, then DS will win out. As for choice 3, there's several ways you can approach that.

1. Get your friends to buy the bosses. You'll probably have to turn over ownership of the minis. Not sure if that'll be fine with you.

2. Decide now that you'll want to get both eventually, plonk down money for one of them (probably DS), and enable yourself to get the others at some later point. When's the deadline for committing to DS bosses at the KS price? As for KDM, pledge a dollar, get the updates, and wait to see how long you can hold off before committing. If you can't afford the $250 before the deadline, maybe you can pick it up at retail later on (probably $400+). I'm guessing DS minis would have similar price increases.
 Here's the way I look at it.

1) KDM is out and has massively positive reviews. DS is still being developed and will *hopefully* be a good game (because I backed it, too), but who knows. 

2) KDM has a massive discount over retail, nearly half off, whereas to me it looks like the DS is priced similar to what you'll get at retail if you wait for sales and such, so why not wait and see if their actually worth it?

3) I trust Poots with my money. He has shown that if he can't deliver, he'll give you a refund. If things aren't working out, he's shown he'll throw his own money in to make it right. If DS falls apart, who knows what will happen. A steaming pile of crap that I have to try and pawn off? I don't think this will happen, otherwise I wouldn't have backed DS, but it *could.*

edit: Format, spelling.
Hansa Teutonica is the best game ever!  That's obviously the most popular opinion in the hobby, right?  Right?  RIGHT?!

Codnames is brilliant (duh).

Sorry, but kinda useless thread.
**Munchkin** is way too long for its own good.
Boardgames are enjoyable.
I like them 
[deleted]
I use apps to learn the game then play it IRL.
Definitely helps.  They get people into the hobby, can be used as a teaching tool, and provide a quick fix for those who cannot play at that exact time.
Helps. Anyone who's played actual board games vs bg apps knows that the experience is completely different.   

What apps can do, is bring more people into the hobby. They present greater accessibility and affordability to the people outside the hobby, and as many advertiser their board game itself in the app, it's possible to bring more people into purchasing the actual game.   

Also, (especially if done entirely in house) the app represents additional revenue streams for game companies/designers of an already established production, which helps the industry in various ways.   

If it weren't for the app, I may not have ever bought any of the Ascension games. I wasn't overly convinced by videos, but 5 minutes into playing the app, I ordered a physical copy. I'm still the only one I know personally the owns any of the Ascension sets.

After playing San Juan, it's moved onto my wishlist. Splendor is also interesting to me for those times more casual gamers stop in, thanks to having played it on my phone. Ingenious also got my attention after playing the app.

So, I think it probably helps.
I think technology is just a bow in the quiver. We are continually becoming more technologically dependant and thus technology is going to play more of a role in things like boardgames. Some will use it well, and some will not. I do think however, that boardgames despite of this fact will maintain being an escape from our typical technology saturated lives. 
I keep all my non-game dice in the Bag of Holding that came with this: https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01476QV14 Not very practical or pretty, but I like it.

For Dice Masters, I use Plano trays.
It's not the best if you want to feature the dice, but my husband and I have a ton of mason jars from our wedding and we use a few as dice storage. You can sort and still see them. Not for everyone I know but that's my two cents. 
I store mine in a [glass container](http://i.imgur.com/pycWqf6.jpg) I picked up at Michael's, but I'm sure most other hobby/craft stores will have similar offerings.  Just be sure to get one with thicker glass.  It looks nice on the game shelves, is a conversation piece, and it's easy to find and pluck out the dice you need.
I remember seeing a dice bag with sections inside it. Does anyone have something like this?
I really wish Pandemic (with expansions) replaced Pandemic Legacy - it has many of the elements of Legacy already and much more replay value.  However, I know most people prefer to play a game a couple dozen times and then be done with it - few seem to like to play the same game over and over and over unless it is a 5-15 minute light filler.

I'd also like to see very similar listings combined (I don't think Through the Ages should have two entries for each version, even through there were some rule changes).

Games I'd like to see break in?  I'd love to see classics like Go or Chess get in there, but the modern boardgaming hobby has a strong bias against these and classic family games like Clue plus wargames.

What would I put in there?  I'd like to see the GMT COIN series in there, but I guess it still hasn't caught on like I would hope.  Play time is probably one major factor, even though Cuba Libre takes about as long as a 4 player game of Agricola (or 50% longer possibly) and is about as complex in rules.

I'd love to see Pax Pamir make it in there also, but people aqre also afraid of Sierra Madre Games titles.  Pax Pamir plays in about an hour and is an interesting take on empire building (you aren't the power, you are in their shadows and trying to curry favor with the giants of the age).  Solid, easy to read design; smooth gameplay; interesting choices; tableau building; multi-representational components; high portability - all reasons why it deserves to be higher than #1050!  However, difficult to read rulebooks (simpler than Through the Ages though), small print runs , and lack of distribution to game stores probably keep this game obscure.
Scythe with Castles of the Mad King Ludwig.

Also swap Twilight Struggle with Castles of Burgundy, Burgundy deserves more love despite #12 being very solid. It needs to be higher!
Only looking at the top 25.

In:

* Go (my only 10/10)
* Shogi
* Dominant Species
* Glory to Rome
* Modern Art
* The Great Zimbabwe
* Container

As you can see I am low on thematic games and prefer little to no luck in my games. Most of the games are fairly old and have stood the test of time as good games. Most of BGG seems to lean towards new games and niche games have such low ownership numbers that they get killed by dummy votes.

Out:

* T.I.M.E. Stories
* Patchwork
* Codenames
* Roll for the Galaxy
* Caverna
* Android: Netrunner

I have avoided removing games that I have not played myself or can't remember playing. I would rather give them a fair shake before removal. Some of these games are not my style as well. These include:

* Scythe
* Concordia
* Keyflower (I have played one of the Key* games, but cannot remember which one)
* Blood Rage
* Star Wars: Imperial Assault
* Voyages of Marco Polo
* Kemet
The top 25 of this sub affects me in no way, so I don't care what's on it lol. I don't think I've ever even looked at it... 


There's an app if you don't mind playing electronically.
Not that I'm aware of. There's no issue with playing both sides though.
There's a PDF file over at Board Game Geek that has the rules for two solo variants: https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/113578/patchwork-solo-rules-2-variants

I haven't tried them yet, but I probably will in the near future! :-)
While normally I'm against suggesting such a thing in a thread like this, the Patchwork app is available for Android, iOS, and even the fossils of Windows Phones, and it's *very* well designed.

You can also definitely search BoardGameGeek for solo variants. Their forums have solo variants for pretty much everything.
Honestly, I preordered it and canceled it b/c all the expansion does is add variants to balance it out and some miniatures. I feel like the game is already well balanced w/ rushing added.
Hey,

Avalon, and Bang (or bang dice) have a hidden traitor mechanic and are short and sweet.

Coup and Love Letters are short and fun, no traitor mechanic. 

Pandemic and Forbidden Island are both co-op role based games. They are longer but I find you can help a younger kid through a Co-op easier.
Dead of Winter. It is co-op, with everyone working towards a common goal. These goals vary in length and complexity. Then there is the option for each player to also have a secret objective. This means each player needs the common goal to be reached plus their secret objective to be successful to win. There is also an option to add in a betrayer. The betrayer will be trying to sabotage the common goal. It's a straighforward game that would be easy to walk a new person through.
I think **Shadows Over Camelot** is your game.

I don't know of any game that has all of the points you suggest, but it hits a lot of them.

>simple enough rules for a group of three to five kids about 7~13 years old

Check. Box says ages 10+ and it might be a little bit challenging for a 7 year old, but I think you can probably get it to work. The actions are pretty simple, and if they can understand poker hands, they should be able to understand how to complete objectives.

>Traitor mechanic

Check. Shadows Over Camelot is one of the first hidden traitor games, and I think it holds up fairly well even today. There's less for the traitor to do in this one than in most, but that might make it easier for a group with younger kids.

>Different roles (teams, chef, saboteur etc.)

Check. Every player chooses a knight from Arthurian legend to play, and each knight has a special power. Additionally, you can quest to find Lancelot's Armor, the Holy Grail, or Excalibur, and they grant small but useful powers to the player who acquires them.

> Option to play multiple "rounds" in succession with points carrying over to next round

Nothing really here, unfortunately, but the game is reasonably long, and involves multiple quests, so it should keep people busy for a while.

>Option to play with more players when guests arrive, without spending too much time on explaining rules

Check. This is where the game really sets itself apart. It's the only game I'm aware of that permits people to join while the game is in progress. There are rules that describe how to handle players dropping out or joining in in the middle of the game.

> Clear and self-explaining rules

This is a matter of opinion. I think the rules are pretty clear and straightforward. The board has places for where you play cards to work on quests, and all of the information for how to play is written on the board, on the cards you draw, or on the character sheets. That said, I think at least one full read through of the rules and quest book is necessary, and then the markings on the rest of the game can serve as reminders.
* **Coup**

* **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** (Best with 5+ players)

* **Invasion Evasion**

I've really only noticed that the repeated fish harvest card is OP. Basically wins you the game if you can save all the fish until the last round and stack them on a higher tier. 

You can definitely win if you want to mostly explore, but you need to be having successes and shoot for the card that gives you victory points for each outpost you have. Best to think ahead and start adding things up. Everyone seems to have different interests in what cards they want next, and likely won't sabotage you unless they are also counting your points.

But, like most story telling games, it's about the adventure and the characters you develope. 
My advice to you is general: don't assume that one strategy is OP after a single game. I have had surprise victories where I mostly did exploration, and I've also seen wins with a balanced approach. The most important thing IMO is to plan around the big VP cards that are available. 
I've won by getting the card that gives bonuses to having villagers, and buying up villagers every round.   Only went to the cave a couple of times and got a few things, but villagers were my big point maker, around 40+.   I had other things going on but that put me over the top.   Couple of different strategies work well but you are right, being really diverse won't win you the game as often as other games reward that strategy.
I've played Above and Below quite a bit, and I've never really felt one strategy was better than another. This is mostly due to each game having different things available initially. If the use a villager right after recruiting building shows up, exploring and getting the points per villager card is very powerful. If steady goods generators show up early, harvesting is pretty powerful.  

Due to its nature as a 'choose your own adventure' style game, Above and Below has very go with the flow gameplay. Sometimes exploration will get you something amazing, other times not so much, but it's almost always worth delving into the caves if you have nothing better to do on your turn. 
coincidentally, i just played above and below for the first time earlier today and i had the exact same experience! so you're not the only one. 3 of us explored a lot and gained nothing much whereas the person who stayed back and harvested won with 60+ points
> Tales of the Arabian Knights

Is it on a reverse crusading theme?
the game is a mediocre at best Euro, with the gimmick of the story book thrown in, don't sweat it to much. Also I don't know what meeple placement is, if you mean "worker placement" as in the game mechanic, this game is generally mis-placed into that category.
From the demo I played at BGG Con, this really is only something that likely happens when the last turn is triggered by troop deployment. Since the turn isn't ended the second the last troop is deployed, it is entirely possible that the player who triggers it will have a spare point of influence or two after deploying their last troop, and the VP is a way of awarding the residual affect you may have been able to achieve with a few extra units.
This is only for the player triggering the end game, either by buying a card and no refill is made, or by deploying all the troops. Once you've deployed all your troops though, YOUMAY still have some unplayed cards in your hand, this is saying that if those cards give you strength points(idk what they're called in the game, we just call them strength, and buy power) or have a "deploy X soldiers" you'll get victory points equal to that

Example, you deployed all your troops, but you still have 2 house guard cards left in your hand(each worth 3 strength points)You would get 6 points instead of deploying.
I've only played the game with 4 players and have 0 experience or desire to play it with lesser player counts, but I've now played it quite a few times.

I can see where the reviewer's criticisms are coming from, and I 100% agree on the variance of yellow/red card strength and potential advantage of the 1st Bren, but I think the rest are exaggerated and I also think he didn't highlight parts of the game that I think are the most interesting and fun (I assume due to wanting to keep the review timely), or one of the game's most glaring problems. And I'm saying this as someone who's subscribed and really love ATGYLAB's content, so don't take this as me shitting on him or anything.

Almost all games suffer from the problem of a poor player potentially helping others. It's a problem, but I don't think it's a very large one and I also don't really see a way around it without sacrificing a lot of the rest of the game. I also don't see too big of an issue with pure attrition combat unless you have poor players, so these two ideas are linked and don't really matter for me. To continue with this, the problem of a new territory being too strong and that people can't get to it is also a problem of poor play, since the Bren, not the one playing the Explore card, is the one who gets to choose its location. Depending on game state, the Bren may want to place it in the thick of things or off in no-man's land, with risks and benefits for each. So I really think the reviewer's qualms with the game mostly boil down to "Bad players can ruin it," which I 100% agree with. I just don't see that as a real fault of the game.

I also think the highlight of the game isn't really... highlighted. The most important way a round is played out after the drafting isn't just the way you can read the draft and who wants what, but to me is actually by how passing your turn and the Pretender token works. Instead of playing a card, the player can pass this turn, but this does NOT restrict them from playing cards in a later round. Since this lets players be reactionary, passing your turn is usually the best thing you do, resulting in a game of chicken. If you think someone else is going to want to continue playing cards, you should almost always pass. The Bren must start the round playing a card, so people want to play a card to "catch up" to the Bren, but they also want to pass their turn so they can respond to other player's actions. But if everyone passes, then the Bren (or whoever has played the most cards at that time) can pass as well, ending the round and gaining "played card advantage." In the same vein, for someone to win they must spend their action to take a pretender token, which lets them win next turn if they still meet the win conditions. This promotes someone passing their turn even further, to both wait to see if someone else takes the pretender token but also to push back their own taking of the token so they have less of a target on their back. We have had a ton of rounds that end with everyone holding several cards, or someone actively not taking a pretender token since many of the key cards that could stop them haven't been played yet, so they just pass to see if the situation gets better. A few things promote not passing, namely the steal-a-card attack card and the choose-from-the-discard card, but the tension of passing is still really prevalent. That interaction to me is an incredibly key component of what makes Inis great, and I really haven't heard many reviewers touch on it (it made me re-read to rule book to make sure I understood the way passing works, but there's even a hint box detailing it).

I do think the game's most glaring problem is with the rule specifically for when you run out of units. When you run out of units, you get to now place 2 more units where ever you want and continue with the round. This ended up being extremely exploitable under certain scenarios both early (to reinforce/reposition at low cost) and late (if sanctuaries are placed primarily on 1-2 locations), so we enforced the house-rule of you only getting to do this during the assembly phase (the beginning of the round). This might punish poor players or the extremely unlucky early game, but we thought it was necessary.

But the REAL biggest issue is that the miniatures are made out of flimsy material and their spears get bent and the women are stuck in a permanent bow, hahaha. I wish I could pay a bit more for higher quality ones.
His major complaint about conflict does not hold much ground to me. I've played 5 games of Inis and this war of attrition can be by passed with proper card usage/drafting or the choice to withdraw from a conflict. 

I also disagree with his complaint about the Bren staying Bren. That will only occur in higher player counts if they fortify one area holding them back from achieving any of the three winning conditions.

It's not a perfect game, but I believe the complaints are over exaggerated. If you want an on the rails the game dictates every little thing you do type game then this isn't for you, but if you want a game of reactions where the players around you and their choices dictate what you do then it's a very good game.
For as much as you he doesn't want to compare it to "dudes on a map" games, he certainly spent the whole time criticizing it based on the fact that it's a "dude's on a map" game.

The game is way more Diplomacy-oriented that troop/area control oriented. The "problem's" with the Brenn being able to hold too easily don't ring true of my plays. If the group sees you getting too strong, they strike you down. It feels like he wants the game to be completely deterministic, which would be boring as hell. I do see the criticism that some of the epic tale cards are better than others, but in an hour long game, I think it's forgivable for this level of randomness.

For example, in Scythe, the Encounter cards are way more impactful, and the game is closer to 2-3 hours where it feels like you can win or lose based on the encounter cards/ secret objective cards. That comes closer to unforgivable to me.
First off, and I've mentioned before, love your work.

Regarding the aspect of the "bad player" ruining the game state by over-committing to an otherwise inconspicuous fight: is there a way that seems to differentiate this in **Inis** from other dudes-on-a-map games? Because I have to admit I've been railroaded into disadvantageous positions by players that simply didn't know the optimum strategies in pretty much any DOAM game I've ever played. Not saying you're wrong (and I forgive you), but I'm just really curious as to why you conclude this bad sort of play is the fault of the game and not the players, with the whole subgenre as a backdrop.
I feel like I am in the minority when I say that I find the game's artwork to be hideous. I know that gameplay is all that matters at the end of the day,  but man I can't help but feel turned off from the game based on looks alone. 
*Games 

... Meh. Damn it all.
I greatly appreciate the critical response. With these hyped games, most reviews do not examine the underlying mechanisms beyond whether he or she enjoyed them. 

I am glad to have bailed on the Inis preorder last month on a gut feeling of the massive hype. Board games are in this odd space between collectables and usables. Because of this duality, most hot new games end up feeling incredibly underwhelming. Thank you for the much needed sober view.  
100% agree. First play hated it. Thought about it, saw some potential and gave it another play. I enjoyed it, but the ending always feels like it's never exciting. My games always seamed to end in someone king making or a long drug out fight with the leader finally wining after several turns, never in danger of loosing just having his win prolonged enough for the game to go another round. That being said I bought someones used copy for the art and occasional play, it'll work for a change of pace on the dudes on a map games I own. Kemet is still my go to.
Wow....+1 for the Prince Edward Island joke! PEI represent!
My first game with this was a personal disaster because I was never able to muster forces with the people cards being drafted before I ever had a chance to grab them. 

I hated this games first play through, I guess ill give it another shot because I too could see where the reviewer saw actual depth of the game. 

Conversely Bloodrage went great every time I've played it. People pick it up quickly, get the thematic elements for the various gods and are able to craft an identity for their army. Inis had none of that.

However I intend to give it another crack to see if it is still super weird.
Inis is good REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Quarto? Cmon, quarto's cool, but it doesnt' take very long before you start getting "cat's games" with it
Some cool out of the ordinary picks but also just a bunch of crap in there. Overall cool list though. 
>We are ultra competitive, and any game where you can betray people would certainly be a plus!

>Usually it's 3-5 people for about 4-8 hours.

**Resistance: Avalon**

Easy to learn, easy to play. 10-20 minute rounds means if someone 'screws up', it's trivial to move on or reset with minimal time lost. Changing allegiances with a central traitor mechanic along with different special roles keeps the game fresh and interesting. Best of all, it's cheap. It's better than the similar *One-Night Werewolf* games in that there are less roles to fool with and there is no player elimination. So faster spin-up for new players and everyone gets to play the entirety of every game.

Downside is it ~~is going to work best with 5 to 7 players. 4 is ok but 3 is IMO unplayable.~~ it requires 5 minimum to play. I think it works best with 7.

**Bohnanza!**

Another cheapo game. It's based on trading cards with other players. This is one of my go-to non-gamer games. To date, about 60% of the non-gamers I've shown it to have ended up buying it.

45-90 minute play time, scales down to 3 or up to 7, very playable in your desired player counts. It's very engaging in that the primary mechanic is trading cards with the other players. Lots of meta games that can be played with making deals and plenty of bragging rights when you end up with the best score.
Try **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** or **Secret Hitler**
Did you mean **Cosmic Encounter**? Each player plays an alien race with a unique power trying to wheel, deal, and backstab your way to the top. Also see my favorite pitch: https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/2se1c2/discussion_pitch_me_your_favorite_game_so_that_id/cnolnvq/
**Diplomacy** is pretty good, it is usually meant for 7 people, but there are ways to play with 5, it is a war game where you can backstab people and make alliances, be prepared for a long game unless you concede to a clear winner. Games can last anywhere between 5-10 hours 
In the last 20 years the following games have been "gateway games". Catan, Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, Dominion. 

Now, I don't play any of these games with my friends any more, there are better games out there (in my opinion) however these four games are responsible for the introduction of boardgames to many many people. If you like them..... there is a whole world of board games just waiting for you.
I would recommend Catan, Dominion, Ticket to Ride, or Smash Up. I got addicted to board games playing Smash Up and then Dominion which is why I recommend them, but Catan and Ticket to Ride are both easy to get into.
**Bang! Dice** 

There are 4 roles, all with different objectives revolving around screwing/helping the other 3 roles. However only one role is public, the rest are secret so it's traitor-ish. Highly replayable and very lively, shooting each other. If you have **Cash'n'Guns**, use their foam pistols for props.

All available actions are on the dice, so explaining is very easy and rounds go very fast (*in contrast to the card game where you have to pull one of each card and explain each one as well as worry about hand management*). With bigger groups, waiting for your turn to come around can take some time, but you have a vested interest in debating what a person's turn says about the role they may have, so it's very engaging.

IMO it doesn't play well at less than 5, so not perfect. Also involves player elimination so someone can end up sitting out of a lot of a game.

::EDIT:: clarity, rulescheck
Me and a couple of friends (who are also heavy into videogames) have been playing Coup for several hours at a time. I would't say it is highly competitive, but it is also not just down to luck either. Tricking your opponents, calling their bluff etc. never gets old and you get better at it with time. It can even be done with a normal deck of cards if you want, though I'd recommend buying the original cards. There's an expansion that adds a new card as well, which adds even more ways of playing on top of the base game.
Love Letter, Resistance / Avalon or Coup work well for board game beginners. They are easy to learn and very fun to play :) 
Check out Risk 2210 or even Game Of Thrones The Board Game, theres plenty of back stabbing to be done there
Something like this: http://shop.zlazr.com/products/copy-of-100-1x1-8-clear-acrylic-hexagons-disc-plastic-plexiglass-geometric-craft

If you get acrylic hexagons then he can take a dry erase marker and change them many times. Of course they can smudge off and you need to hide them since you can see through them but it could be useful if he's changing them a lot.
If you like 2 player games I'd recommend **Holmes:  Sherlock & Mycroft**.  Not a mystery solving game but an easy to learn and strategic set collecting game.  A game takes 20-30 minutes.  
**Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries** is a great game for a pair at the entry level if it'll primarily be the two of you. It's better than USA/Europe for 2 and can play a 3rd.

**Evolution** is a great card game at any player count, easily accessible, and has expansions to support it if you like it.

**Splendor** is worth looking into as an entry level game about making an efficient use of your resources and cards.

**Roll for the Galaxy** might be hard to understand at first, but it is the best dice game I've played. It's the hardest on this list, but if you don't underestimate yourself, you won't have a problem. It's my fiancee and my most played game.
My wife and I are also just getting into board games!

We've picked up **Pandemic** and **Pandemic: Contagion** which are both awesome and fun for 2-5 folks. Contagion is a stand-alone game, and plays a bit differently than vanilla Pandemic though just FYI.

We also picked up **X-Wing**, which I feel like is a bit much for us but we're still having a ton of fun with it. It also appeals to my inner Star Wars/collector nerd, so I'm digging it if only for all the tiny ships. 

We played **Flashpoint Fire Rescue** today at a shop and enjoyed that as well. 

For more party game stuff, we've got **Exploding Kittens** and **We Didn't Playtest This At All**. Both are good casual party games that can be explained in 5 minutes. 
Patchwork is a great 2 player game.

I mostly play with just my wife, although we prefer games with some meat to them. 

Our favorites: 

**Troyes** 
2-4 players. This will be back in print early 2017. Many say it's at its best with 3 players, but it plays wonderfully with just two as well! 

**Ginkgopolis** 
2-4 players. This is, sadly, out of print, indefinitely... So not a great recommendation, I know - we just love it so much! For the record, I would never want to play with 3 or 4. It is PERFECT with 2. 

**Castles of Burgundy** 
2-4 players. Everyone and their mom likes to recommend this game to new players looking for a nice Eurogame for two. Despite reading time and time again how great it is, I hadn't actually played it until two weeks ago. It does live up to the hype as far as I'm concerned. Not my all-time favorite but very good! 

**Five Tribes** 
2-4 players. I love playing this with two. Each player takes two turns each round. Since you bid for turn order, this means you may be able to go four times in a row (if you see that many good setups or moves you want to take before your opponent does!). In summary the two-player version makes the bidding phase more of a game in itself! 

**Haggis** 
If you're looking for a straight-up card game - four suits, Aces through Kings, yada yada - this one is excellent. A trick-taking game, and my wife - who typically despises card games - loves it. 

-

You'll also frequently see recommendations for: 
- **Patchwork** 
- **Jaipur** (although I'd recommend **Morels** AKA **Fungi** instead) 
- **All Creatures Big and Small** (I think this is currently OOP, but should be available again soon?) 
- **7 Wonders Duel** 

While not my favorites, I can certainly vouch that all are quality games. 
for my wife and me. I'm sorry not sorry
If you aren't afraid of rule books and learning a worker placement game, I would suggest above and below. It's a great game with stories and strategy. Great art aswell.
My wife and I met in a gaming group, and our typical date night is dinner and board games. Among our favorites:

**Star Realms**

**Castles of Burgundy**

**Pecking Order**

**Rivals for Catan**

**Pandemic** (and its expansions)

**Dwarven Miner**

**Stone Age**

**7 Wonders** (Has a two-player variant in the rulebook. We're eager to try the Duels version.)

I recommend finding a game store that hosts a board game night to try things out with others who can make recommendations. Or find a store with demo copies and play a few things together.

Edit: Formatting
Well, if you like dark and gritty games, and one that will keep you occupied for over a year with just the base set, might I recommend the following: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/poots/kingdom-death-monster-15/description

Delivery time is Summer 2017. The 2020 date is for all future projects funded by the backers who opted in.

There are reviews and play-throughs on youtube you can watch and get an idea from. We also have a subreddit if there are questions.
Seeing that 2 player games would be the best fit for you, I highly recommend 7 Wonders Duels. It's made just for 2 players (as the name suggests) and is a blast to play. It's possible to play several games on a night due to its short length as well. You don't need to be familiar with its parent game to enjoy it. 

Dead of Winter is also a really solid game, although I would not advise it for the casual player. Even my dedicated group had trouble beating just a single scenario in that game, although we managed it once. I'd say the game works better with more than 2 players, since it introduces the concept of a traitor in the mix, which really adds a lot to the game (though it also makes it even harder). If you're really into the zombie apocalypse theme though, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy it.
**Dead of Winter** is great. We initially played it straight co-op, and picked shorter, easier goals. Then we added in the secret objectives, and now we always play the Prisoners Dilemma variant. It really is a fabulous 2P co-op, with the added twist of secret objectives and a potential betrayer.

"Better" is a completely subjective idea.  You may get 15 people reply telling you that one of those games is "better", but you might play it, and find out that you hate it for some reason, and would prefer the other one.  
  
That's like asking whether chocolate or vanilla ice cream is "better"; they're both good, if you like ice cream, but different people have preferences for different reasons.  
  
As much hate as games like Monopoly gets around here, you're still able to find people who absolutely love it.  Those people may think that Monopoly is better than [insert popular game here], but that doesn't mean that everyone has to agree with them.
Agricola is better than Five Tribes. Why? Because you are building a food production engine.
I can't really say which is "better" as that's very subjective. Agricola is the heavier game of the two and requires you to play a very tight game. You'll be punished with negative points if you're not able feed your family every harvest. 

Five Tribes starts out with tons of possibility space and narrows as the board starts to clear out. Conpared to Agricola where a new action space is opening up every turn. 

You're not punished as much for inefficiencies in Five Tribes but it's harder to build any sort of real engine. Instead you need to look at the many, many ways you can score points, see what your opponents are going after, and find a niche they're not exploiting that you can ride to victory.


I agree with other posters that the answer is subjective, because they fall into very different weights and categories, but I prefer Five Tribes to Agricola because I enjoy finding the best move on the fly on a dynamic board, and developing a longer strategy accordingly. 

Agricola requires deeper strategy which you must develop within your first couple turns, and early mis-steps will invariably lead to a long, miserable game against clear winners.
4000 games of Agricola and still going
I can confirm that hms dolores is a lot of fun
I want to play Millions of Dollars just to do this during the game:

https://youtu.be/OK2f5ZlzrxE?t=1m14s
I wish that Millions of Dollars/Gentleman's Deal were available in US....
I've been interested in Millions of Dollars since I first heard of it but the other two are now on my radar. Thanks SU&SD!

The one thing I'm unclear about in MoD (and I should probably just read the rulebook) is that i assume I can lie and say I'm a role represented on the table, right? Or could I lie and say I'm an uncovered Snitch to try and extort some money? IF there were two drivers on the table and someone snitched on a driver to get them eliminated, how would they choose which is which? Do you point at Player A and say, "If you're the driver, you're eliminated." Or do you just point at Player A and just say "You're out, even though I'm not entirely sure who you are until you reveal."  
Millions of Dollars looks great fun!
All of them look intriguing! Gentleman's Deal and Millions of Dollars are both on my radar thanks to their higher player counts. Millions of Dollars looks very interesting gameplay wise and Gentleman's Deal being able to just take away someone's offered take seems like a lot of fun in a group setting.
But how do they compare to [intrigue](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/265/intrigue)
Damn. Now I want all of them :(
So imma let you finish the review and all but did anyone notice Blood Bowl in the background? I'm curious how they will rate it, being one of the sacred cows of gaming with oodles of nostalgia factor... but also the new edition being *so* poor on a number of levels.

It could be the gushiest review ever or the most excoriating. If they review it that is... but Quinns wouldn't tease us like that would he?
HMS Dolores looks like a 2-4 version of dead Last, right?
I have been looking to get a negotiation game for my collection. I was about to pull the trigger on Dead Last. Quinns just made my decision more difficult.

...Bastard.
Jeez you got the reddit link up fast. Coincidence or are you linked to the SUSD crew? Either way, good stuff.
Having only seen and never played Legends of Andor, my vote goes to Mice & Mystics. The theme and characters are initially kid friendly and kind of cute (though it gets pretty thematically and emotionally dark as you progress) and the game "teaches" you how to play with each new mission. I've heard Andor does the same, but Mice & Mystics feels more forgiving and, better still, organic. I'd say that's a plus for younger players.

I've played Mice & Mystics with my mom up to Downwood Tales Chapter 3 (so far!) and her gaming level is nearly that of a younger gamer, but I've seen her develop strategies as we've gone along. Very rewarding experience for me. I took care of the "bookkeeping" in the initial chapters, but now she understands how to works so I let her take control with a few corrections here and there. If your daughter is Carcassonne-level smart, she's ahead of my mom.

Not to mention: The story is super engaging (Heart of Glorm crushed me), most rules are easy because they're thematic and consistent (if the rules change, there's usually a chapter that forces you to use them for thematic reasons); Many of the scenarios present you with "this or that" situations which broadens game play more than you'd expect; and there's a fun "level up" versus resource spending system that involves interesting decision making without a whole lot of punishment. By the time you're done with book one, you'll have up to six unique characters ready to tackle book 1.5!

Bonus: The miniatures and other components are of fantastic quality and the artwork is beautiful.
If she can play Descent then Mice and Mystics should fit her nicely. That said, my boys at that age did not have the patience for Mice and Mystics, it could take over 1.5 hrs and couldn't keep their attention at the time. This is not a knock on Mice and Mystics, but just where they were then.

I actually just finished a Kickstarter for a game I designed because of this. It is basically a light weight quick play narrative game targeted at families. If you are interested you can check out [Robit Riddle](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/babageekgames/robit-riddle-storybook-adventures?token=a85c53d4). It isn't shipping until next year, but you might find it interesting.
Hi there, 

My wife and I have played both games. I would say mice and mystics is better for your situation. For a child of that age, the story is very engaging, the characters are easy to connect with, and there is some great dialogue to get her emotionally attached to. The miniatures are nice (we painted ours) and the length of the story is really great for the price (with multiple expansions available). 

Legends of Andor is a great game, we just got it 2 days ago and have played it 4 times already. The major appeal though is the gameplay from a strategy perspective. The level of strategy required is higher, and optimally you would play with 3-4 people. The pieces are OK but nothing like the appeal of the miniatures in mice and mystics, and the story has only generic tolkienesque archetypes and no real characters to connect with. It is more of a strategy game than an RPG. 

So definitely mice and mystics is my vote. 
I have not played either myself, but I know a kid who played Mice & Mystics when he was four.  He needed help, but got the basics.  I am sure a seven-year-old could handle it easily enough.
Andor is way too much imo.
Never played either, but have heard good things about Mice and Mystics with younger kids in that age range.
That's the age I got tired of Risk as too simple and picked up the original Axis and Allies,  maybe you can spawn a lifelong wargamer. 
Was certainly interested. Vassels review put out on the backburner for me. I like the idea but the game didn't look crazy interesting outside of the gimmick. 
I really liked it, but after four plays I kind of saw everything it had to offer. It's definitely worth picking up at this price to get a few plays in. The art and production quality is great.
Queen Games is running another sale on Amazon, so you can get a number of titles for under $20-$25 today

Ugh, I hate this game. Don't just buy it because its cheap. Watch a video on it or play it first.
Agree completely. Great price for this. Very fun game/
I think Descent is about the closest I have played to WOW, with the new App it is Co-Op.
Any hard co-op game with a lot of moving parts. 

I actually think of the games I'm familiar with **Sentinels of the Multiverse** both in terms of theme (fighting a raid boss is basically the premise of the game) to how many mechanisms you have to remember (destroy the matriarch's mask ASAP or she just plays her whole deck) does a great job of emulating a boss fight. There's even informal roles for the hero decks where some have "redirect all damage to this character" cards and other decks are focused on things like buffing damage or shutting down card draw from villain and environment decks. 

The more I think about it the more I realize Sentinels really does emulate a raid fight incredibly well. 
Massive Darkness once it is out?
Myth

Boss fights all have multiple stages, there is some looting to be done, and some carry over between missions. 

THE 1ST Printing had a terrible rule set and there were some really bad reviews . The 2.0 version,which comes with the game from their website or you can download a pack for free, fixes a lot of the issues.

It's very free form though and mission structure/enemy numbers/types outside of the  modules (published stories) available is up to the players

Still closest game I have seen to wow style mechanics
As a former WoW addict and raider, the best games I've found that can bring that feeling have been(in no particular order):

* Descent 2e with DM app

* Shadows Over Brimstone

* Gloomhaven looks like it'll be right in line

* Conan kinda

* And I haven't played them, but the D&D games may be in that same vein.
Sounds like you want to run D&D on Heroscape terrain, which is probably amazing.
I would suggest Shadows of Brimstone: tiles, dungeons, loot and gear, progression, even stops between missions to go to the town and sell stuff. Highly customisable too, with tons of fan made expansions and campaigns. 
Shadowrun crossfire. It's as hard as a raid and needs as much coordination. Yoy don't get loot but you do level up. Full cooperation, no dm
Check out Aeons End. Should be out in the next couple weeks. Seems to have a WoW boss fight feel. 
Assault.on Doomrock.
Descent.  With the [Valkyrie](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1628895/prerelease-open-overlord-app-valkyrie) mod you can create your own scenarios that play out like the app.
I guess Descent or Vast does something like this.
Honestly, the closest I've come to the same "feeling" of raiding in WoW aren't sword and sorcery games. My reco list: 
- Pandemic Legacy (I mean, of course)
- Pandemic Cthulu (good twist on pandemic)
- Forbidden Desert (light, fun, always hard)
- TIME Stories (definitely check this out)
- XCOM The Board Game (app-enabled stress)
- Descent 2e (I've heard the app is pretty tight, never tried, base game is fun)

I haven't played these, but I'm hopeful these might scratch the WoW raiding itch: 
- Kingdom Death: Monster (got $300 and 4 years to wait?) 
- Dark Souls Board Game (anyone's guess what the rules will be like, cool minis though)
**TIME Stories** has that feel of working together to take down a boss, wiping and coming back with a new strategy to try again. My group really loves it.
My girlfriend loves Harry Potter- does it actually feel like an immersive experience?
My wife and I have Splendor (by Marc Andre) which can be pretty fun as a two player, but works well with 3 or 4 if company comes over.
Dominion is another example of a card game that can work fairly well with only two people (given the right choice of deck) but also scales well if there is company. I love that Dominion has multiple expansions which gives a huge amount of diversity.

We love Settlers and so we bought the 2 player card game version called Rivals of Catan which is pretty fun.

These games aren't co-op unfortunately, but might be worth looking at if you two are in the market for more games.
If you liked that check out

**The Big Book of Madness**!  It has a very similar theme to Harry Potter but most critics prefer this over HP. 

You might also like **Aeon's End** for a step up in complexity. I'm really looking forward to it. 

These are both coop deck builders as well! 
Does the game have a lot of replayability? 
Welcome to the hobby.  Good thing you didn't get **T.I.M.E. Stories** as your first pickup.  The game is great but not really replayable, also it is best at 4.  I hope your adventures in the hobby give you lots of great memories.
I just binge-played this over Thanksgiving with my family.  What  great game!  I find it more interesting than **Legendary** due to the "legacy-ish" arch of the game.  You kind of play a campaign through all 7 books, but can reset everything if needed.  The game starts easy, but quickly becomes challenging.  The gameplay feels balanced and the quality of the components is solid.  I have over 100 games and this one is one of the best "bang for the buck" games I've gotten in a long time.
Check out legendary (marvel or encounters) for more co-op deck builders 
FYI - a lot of copies are [missing Stupefy cards in Game 5](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1655020/stupefy-card-missing). It's not a huge deal since it's just two cards out of the Hogwarts deck, but if you contact USAopoly they'll send them to you for free. 
You know what I really appreciate about the game? The packaging really does provide great storage. I use little 2oz plastic condiment containers for the damage and coin tokens. 

Overall, a game I highly recommend. 
Always great to hear about people getting into the hobby! I'd highly recommend that you two look for **Patchwork** -- it's a fantastic 2-player game about quilting.
Hmm, I am glad you posted this. I have been looking for a Harry Potter game for a while. There are lots of themed games, but only a handful of actual unique games. I hadn't even heard that this one had been released. I think I'll snag it for Christmas for my wife and I. 
This post must contain spoilers but i've only played twice so read at your own risk

Our first playthrough we got haunt 42 and I was the betrayer. I turned over the item discard pile 1 card at a time because i had no item which seemed the completely most fair way to do it and I got the revolver. I then 1 shot killed the old dude which got me a kill right away but the tile I needed was not revealed. I explored like 1 more tile and got the one I needed but the survivors kept putting their objective on me as I went to get the old dude. I barely got him to where he needed to go and rolled what I needed on the only turn I had left and won as the betrayer and we still talk about it a week later. 

Tonight my wife was the betrayer, she failed the haunt roll with only 3 cards out which was laughable but we "rolled" with it ha ha. I think we got 32 or whatever for the madman with a book in the furnace and we somehow drew the pickpocket right away and were able to get her book and then go burn it after like 1 or 2 rounds so the survivors won. It seems like each haunt is unfairly leveled in 1 way or the other so when you trigger the haunt  either gtfo of that floor or stay there if you can win lol..

I think it's a pretty sweet game the way they have so many haunts but I agree, you find certain mechanics or rules that don't make sense and it kind of breaks the game and then you just have to house rule things and hope its fair 
My partner and I were really excited to introduce that game to some friends and we were really talking up the betrayer mechanic.  We got the Treasure Hunt haunt in which there was no betrayer.  It was so disappointing that we got like the one scenario that did not have a traitor.
I *really* don't like Small Change (I want to say either Haunt 35 or 37). I'd just recommend skipping that one.
89 is ridiculously poorly balanced, traitor wins before the heroes have a chance to do anything.
Haunt 49 was not a great experience for my group. We found that the Astral Spirits were way too powerful and the heroes couldn't really do anything. It also didn't help that it was our first time playing the game.
Was 97 the one with wolves and barricades and shit? That was written by the guy that made the zombie board game (cant remember the title, Dead something) and he basically plastered his game's rules over Betrayals. Which i thought was fucking stupid, if I wanted to play your fucking game i would have picked it instead!

To answer your question: that one described above and also Plastic Fantastic. WAY too many monsters to keep track of.
I play games with my 3 y/o sometimes, but that dumbshit sucks at Twilight Struggle. I win like, almost half the time.
Remember, when you're playing candyland, pick 2 cards and let them choose. It makes the game go faster and they learn basic strategy. 
I play King of Tokyo with my 3yo. We just remove the cards from the game, and we made a rule that 3 power cubes equal a point. 
Yay!

We're working on [First Orchard](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41302/first-orchard). Got about 1/2 the skills down.
Hurrah! I have a three month old and am so looking forward to the day where she can play games. 
My son is 2.5 and I've played a few HABA games with him like Animal Upon Animal, Evening At The Stable, and Orchard/First Orchard. He loves playing with the bits, and even doesn't mind rolling the dice sometimes, but he still doesn't get that there are rules and conditions on how this is supposed to happen.

We had him at a games cafe a little while ago to fulfill a math trade, and sat down to play Orchard amidst all the other gamers (playing Kemet or Dominant Species or what have you) and he was much more attuned to the experience. 

He also loves playing with all the bits and pieces that come with Dad's games... and I generally let him, so long as they aren't cards or something else that could be easily damaged. He's building a good appreciation of games as a result, I think.
My three year old really likes Pitch Car. 
I've just bought Rhino Hero for my wife for Christmas, and I'm hoping our four-year-old will want to play too.
Saving for later.  Thanks for this post. Just bought a bunch of haba games for my 2.4 yr old son.  I was looking at pitch car but it's a little pricey on amazon.  I bought monza so we will see if that's too advanced or not.  Thanks again.
What's a mimi? 
The Tales and Games series is great too.
We play Happy Salmon with my 4 yo and he loves it. 
My SOs nieces and nephews are all about 2-3, the oldest of which is turning four soon.  I am so excited to be able to start playing games with them. It will be any day now!!
My 2 year old enjoys the Goodnight Moon Matching Game. What's cool is that it comes with multiple rule sets that get progressively more boardgame-y as she matures and can handle them.
How long until Deano's first Twilight Imperium game?
I too, have played a game with my unborn fetus.
The new Harry Potter game has screens from the films rather than original artwork and to be honest that has turned me off from the game. If I played it and found it to be good I'd probably get it but the artwork has kept from taking a chance on it when there are other games that interest me more.
I recently bought Castles of Burgundy, damn that's an ugly box. It looks like a jigsaw puzzle your grandma has had since 1970.
I would love to love **Power Grid** but I just find the theme so dull. It's a shame because I really like the mechanics.
I passed on Carcassonne in stores quite a few times because the box art is so pretty bad, inside is a different story.
Legendary Encounters Firefly. Every card I've seen looks hideous and is what is preventing me from getting it.
**Santorini**. Why oh why did the Roxley edition have to use chibi-esque artwork of baby Greek gods?! 

Doesn't keep me from playing my DIY version, though.
**Glory to Rome.** I've heard so many good things about it, but the artwork is worse than **Munchkin**. I guess I'm not into super-cartoony artwork in boardgames, especially if the game itself isn't cartoony in theme.
**Puerto Rico** is among my very first purchases and still sits unplayed. I  have heard over and over that it is a great game but every time I open the box I am just so underwhelmed that I can not bring myself to try it out.
**Shogun**. Part of the reason I didn't pick it up is because it's rather ugly.
Dominon. I Havent gotten around to trying it because something else always catches my eye
Space Empires 4X. I love 4X's and we actually get them to the table every so often. I've heard this one is the OG and really solid but man, I can't get over how ugly and boring it looks. 
No game in particular, but it does bug me when they recycle art assets. I mean, I get it, if you're gonna spend however much on the rights to an art it makes sense to wring as much out of it as possible, but it's just kinda jarring when you know Plascrete Carapace's art by heart and then somebody writes "Bowie Knife" over it in sharpie.

Relatedly when games have mechanically distinct cards with the same art, again I get that art costs money and games have budgets, but setting aside aesthetics the only mechanical purpose of the art is to allow you to easily identify cards at a glance without having to keep checking the title or picking up the card to see which vaguely arcane symbols they placed on the layer above the generic tome background.
I've passed over Guildhall many times at my FLGS because the box and card art is so bad.  I just had a chance to play someone else's copy at my gaming group and I was pleasantly surprised. There is a tight little hand management / set collection game in that ugly ass box.  
**Hive** because I can't deal with insects. The visceral reaction is really awful even around abstractions of bugs like the tiles are. Otherwise looks like a great game.
I will never not love Ascension, but I really don't like any of the art that isn't the Dreamscape expansion.  
**Kingdom Death: Monster** has fantastically detailed minis and the art production values are through the roof, but is a huge turn-off for me stylistically.

Giant, crawling, monster-babies and lion creatures with enormous head-mounted tentacle dongs? That's a giant box of nope.  

It's a real shame that I can't get past the theme as the game sounds amazing.



I've always thought **GOSU** looks like a neat game mechanically, but the goblin artwork on the cards, while very well done, just kind of turns me off, and would certainly my wife who is my main gaming partner.  
  
Additionally, **La Granja** looks like a great game, but the theme of farming is not epic in scope enough for my tastes. Take the same game and make it about building a city, or a space station, or managing the trades of an entire country and I enjoy it more. I find games that are too narrow or small in scope don't inspire me as much.
I'm interested in **Orleans**  but the colours and artwork are stopping me from buying it 
I'm breaking your rule, since I've already tried Agents of smersh and I really enjoyed it. But that whole cheap, cgi art style that you would see on a flash games website really makes it hard to want to take it out and play it.
Great Western Trail :/
Totally a minority here, but Avalon! The art is amazing, but I've just seen too much medieval or super sci-fi stuff. If there could be a bloods-vs-crips, or super minimalistic art, or democrats-vs-republicans, or cats-vs-dogs, or FBI-vs-terrorists, or feuding Japanese warlords, or Lincoln-vs-Hitler, or Mean Girls, or game of thrones, or old crones vs young whippersnappers, or zombies vs survivors, or mermaids-vs-centaurs, or pokemon-vs-digimon, or mario-vs-link, or roman legion-vs-napoleons army, or 1920s noir theme version.
I really like **Biblios** but it rarely hits the table for his dull theme and really unexciting artwork.  
**Roads & Boats**. Only game I ever sold because it was too ugly. 
For me, it would be **Dead of Winter**.  I don't care a lick about zombies, have never had any interest in this game, but reluctantly played recently at a meetup.  It is actually a very good game. . . but I still didn't enjoy it at all, because the theme was such a turnoff.

Any other theme, and I would be all about this game.
No one's mentioned Legendary Firefly?  No one?!?
**Nations**. It's a pretty good game, but the artwork sucks balls. I find it a bit frustrating that Through the Ages got an art upgrade but Nations won't. 
* Twilight Struggle (don't like the art/graphics)
* Inis (hate the map tiles)
* Food Chain Magnate (looks like a prototype)
* Vast the Crystal Cavern (looks like a prototype) 
I'd love a Concordia sci-if theme version.
**Caylus** - the game is great, but the art is so bad that i cant force myself to get it. Even the deluxe edution looks bland and ugly thanks to the similar art :(
**Nuns on the Run** - needs a boarding school retheme and not to use standees for the patrols. I'd rather have some sort of mini or token over a standee.

In fact, I hate standees more than I hate *moar minis* kickstarters.
**Twilight Struggle** - hands down.  The visual appeal compares easily to the taste of saltine crackers.  From what I've seen in pictures, **Food Chain Magnate** is in the same boat.  Mechanically I'm sure they're amazing games, but both games really should be sold in a brown paper bag.
Flashpoint.  The artwork of the game makes it feel like a little kids game.  I think i more realistic version of a burning building and stuff would be more appealing to older gamers.
**Memoir 44** for me. There's just something about shooting soldiers to bits that makes it impossible for me to imagine enjoying this game. By all accounts it is a fantastic game, but I just can't ignore the theme.
Patchwork. I'm intrigued by the tetrisy aspects of it, but have zero interest in the theme. In fact, I'm embarrassed to buy it. 
[deleted]
I bought a similar listing off Wish.com recently and yes I would imagine you are getting a similar glorified print and play version... Definitely not the quality of what KS backers are getting.. With that said mine was $12 and we had an absolute blast playing it till 2:30 in the morning today from starting about 8 last night.. 

All the group would be considered non board gamers (ok beside me maybe) but once we got into the flow of things the game really picked up and a blast was had by all. Two people of the group said that they thought it was going to be a long night when I was explaining the game and were ready to give up and go back to just drinking games, but that by the 3rd game they were hooked. We had some terrible games in the beginning where liberals were trying to be deceitful just because they saw the fascists doing so that resulted in some easy eliminations. I also was the first person inspected a majority of the time because despite it being my first time to play the game as well they felt I had some sort of Super Secret Hitler ability that they couldn't overcome..when I was a fascist in these cases being examined by a liberal I couldn't refute the revelation because no one was thinking about strategy enough to disagree with checker and it looked bad if I laid into the "new" players.. But all was well and my group loved it..probably going to buy ONUW or Codenames next to supplement after all the Fascsism dies down. 
   
OP needs either a prophet or a really good fortune cookie for this one
I'm pretty sure the box of the real version looks very different.  Almost definitely a knock-off version.
The box and cards look totally different on the real version, but if I bought it and got exactly what the pictures showed I wouldn't be too mad, it looks like a really glorified print and play
If the image matches any one of [these](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20161127112405&SearchText=Secret+Hitler), it's probably not an original production and your quality might vary. 
Since I didn't see it in the comments yet, get well soon. Mental health is really important and I think it's fantastic that you're getting the help you need. 
Exploding kittens

Smash Up

Boss monster

Sushi Go

Sheriff of Nottingham 

Forbidden Island

Flash Point (maybe)

BTW,  get better. I'm glad you're getting help when there is such a terrible stigma on mental health. I don't know you and I fully recognize that, but I'm already proud of you. 
Dixit.
When I was in the psych ward, we used to enjoy playing Apples to Apples while we waiting for our nightly sleeping pills to kick in. It was a hoot. 
Double check with the nursing staff first, as there may be certain items they won't want brought in. 

Small pieces could be choked on. They've already taken your shoe laces and belts for your own protection, and if you have electronics, they won't let you keep the charger due to fears of self-harm, both yours and other patients.

Cards that could be absentmindedly stolen/destroyed. How many games do we all have in our collections that can't be played correctly because we're missing a piece?

Arguments/conflicts that could arise from competitive games. Some people will be more accepting than others, and heavy card stock that could be used, in theory, as a weapon.

Good luck in there, bud. I was personally disappointed when I did a stay and they didn't have a ping pong table. Hope you have quieter nights than I had.
depends on the specifics, but maybe http://meeplelikeus.co.uk will help?  they do accessibility stuff, including emotional/cognitive/behavioural analysis
You brought cards to the psych ward because you were concerned about not playing with a full deck?
Whatever you choose, thank you so much for making people's stay better. That's really kind and generous of you! My suggestions: Apples to apples allows a lot of people to play, and if a few cards go missing it won't affect gameplay. Also would be really interesting to see what associations people make! Connect 4, mancala, backgammon are two player games with high replay value that can be played with buttons or coins if necessary. Dice games might also be good (zombie dice, Yahtzee, dungeon roll etc) although more prone to have pieces getting lost. 
My recommendation is something from the Onirum universe I.e. Onirum, castellon, sylvion. (I'm sure I've spelled these wrong but I'm writing on my phone and too lazy to check). All three have a very small footprint and can be played single player or with two I believe. Should be fairly easy to learn and teach as well!
I'll second Love Letter and Fluxx. Loonacy is another good one along the same lines. 

You want the most gateway of gateway games, so Sushi Go might be a loser.

You also worry about losing pieces, so Ticket To Ride, Carcassonne, and Pandemic might also be not great.

You don't want to start fights (or the staff don't want fights to start, at least), so I'd pass on Catan, Munchkin, and Hanabi.

I would probably mostly stick with card games.

I'd say it's different what will work with you there vs what will work after you're gone. *You* can surely teach Sushi Go,  and *you* would make sure Pandemic is put away whole...

How about Love Letter or Sushi Go?
I appreciate you doing this. Someone close to me would have enjoyed your company in there! I wish you well.

I'll try to think of something appropriate to add... For now, just sending good vibes

Edit: **Codenames**! Very easy rules and setup, not broken if a few cards are lost
I haven't played Tokaido yet, but from what I've read, it's a very calming, zen-like game that's not very competitive. 
Without going into specifics, I've been in your situation.

First, check with your nurses for limits. There might be limits on the container/pieces you can have. I cannot stress this enough; I couldn't bring Carcassone because of the fear that tile edges could be sharpened and used as cutting implements and/or the tiles could be torn apart and used to choke yourself. It all depends on where you're at, so asking is the best policy.

Second, you ***need*** to keep content in mind. I'm seeing some people recommend Flash Point, Love Letter, Exploding Kittens, et cetera. My blanket rule would be to stick to either G-rated cute games, or G-rated historical games. During my stay, I had fellow patients in there for everything from bad relationship breakups to pets dying to not quite being able to going directly there after some tragedy that killed everyone else in their family but them. You literally have no idea what the thing is gonna be that landed someone in the seat beside you; the last thing I would've wanted to do is pull out Kittens in a Blender before I found out one of the women during my stay had a psychotic break after her cat died, because her husband had died years before and it was the last link she had remaining to him. So many of the things we take for granted as themes are the things that broke someones' entire world. I can't guarantee you won't hit rocky spots with trivia games if someone is really bummed about which year Nixon stepped down, but entire games themed around houses being on fire, relationships, any sort of animal abuse(Even the cute ones I really enjoy, like Exploding Kittens), or things of that nature should probably just be avoided. I'd even be wary of abstract games with a theme, like *Tsuro of the Seas*, just in case.

Those things being said, the two games that really got me through it were **Sushi Go** and **Timeline**, both of which I left there when I left, after teaching the staff to play.

Sushi Go is a simple enough card game, and I felt like the stabler patients wouldn't have a problem with it. On top of which, it's cheap enough that even if completely ruined, it's not a ton to replace.

The various Timeline games were fantastic. Simple enough for just about anyone to play, and because it's based on real world events, it has the trivia element to draw people in. My favorite aspect of it, though, is that every card is disposable; if someone wrecks a single card, oh well, that card just isn't available anymore. But every card is literally an event name on one side, and the event name and year on the other. And there're enough expansions and categories for just about anyone to enjoy.
Lanterns is one of my personal favorites, very simple and pretty. Also Dixit would be a good one in this situation, doesn't lose anything from a few missing cards.
Lotus
Maybe Machi Koro? It's easy to learn and it wouldn't ruin the game if a few cards go missing. As long as they weren't the starter cards, I suppose.
Patchwork would be a great choice.
Jenga!

Qwirkle is a good choice too 

Zombie Dice
Card games are ideal. Games like Sushi Go and Dead Man's Draw.
Okay, so first off the bringing a full deck thing brought a smile and a laugh to me. Thank you so much.

I'd err towards simple co-op games.  So stuff like Pandemic would strike me as a good call.

I know my little brother was in a ward for a while, and they were always happy to see Zombicide, Phase 10, Skip-Bo, and Five Crowns.

Also, snacks.  Snacks are important.
I see you already have it, but just came to say that star realms got me through a similar stay recently. If you don't have it already, have someone pick up the gambit expansion for you. The solo and co-op modes included in that set can make it better when no one wants to play or no one wants to lose
I've got a buddy doing a two month hitch in a facility for PTSD, I sent him with my copy of Space Hulk: Death Angel.  I figured it was a very low-profile game but still deep and complex, as well as being solo-able.  The expansions are getting tough to come by but you should be able to find the core game online still.
Kittens in a Blender and Poo! are super simple and rely only on cards. You need markers for Poo!, but they can be anything (scraps of paper, coins, candy...). Carcassonne would also be good. Echoing everyone else, Apples to Apples would be lots of fun and if cards are lost or damaged there's no harm to overall gameplay.
[Concept](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147151/concept) is mostly cooperative guessing game with simple rules. The cards have easier and harder questions and you can choose which to do. You also always have a teammate who can help so the is no pressure on you. And it is great fun! :)

Codenames is also great but a bit more stressful and demanding for the two captain. And it needs 6+ players to be fun.

Get well!
Single player, I'd normally suggest **Hostage Negotiator** or **Onirim**, maybe even the new **Arkham Horror LCG**, but those would likely be frowned on given where you are. 

For more players, it depends... 

The **Lord of the Ring : LCG** could work, but has a level of complexity that might rule it out.

**Hive** specifically the pocket edition could work, but some people dislike bugs.

Something like **Lotus**, **Kodama** or **Arboretum** perhaps, a pleasant meditative theme. 



     
**Niya**, **Love Letter**, **Codenames**. Get well soon.
The following are all short games that have been successful with my non-gamer friends and that I could see go over well with people who want something light as they work through an illness:

No Thanks
Lost Cities (2 player)
Hanabi
Qwixx
For Sale
Dixit
Concept
Splendor
Wizard 

Slightly more thinky 2 player games :
Quarto 
Onitama 

I hope your recovery goes well. 


Sushi go
I would recommend **Hive**.  
It's affordable, near indestructible, and the gameplay is quick. But just like chess, the depth of strategy is entirely up to those playing.

Also, if you get a good amount of people that want to play something, you could easily play **Skull** with that deck of cards. Just make the Spades your skulls, and all other suits can be the flowers. 

Get better soon, friend. I know those places aren't the best, but it sounds like you're making the best of it - which is important!
Lanterns, Qwirkle, Bohnanza, Hey! That's my Fish.
Carcassonne 
Dixit is soothing.
- **Medieval Academy** - it's a drafting game with a medieval theme that hits a nice level of complex without feeling too agonizing on the decisions.

- **Between Two Cities** - Semi cooperative drafting/tile laying game where each person makes two cities with each of their neighbors and the person who has the best score of their worst city wins. 

- **Deep Sea Adventure** - I'm not sure about the theme for your situation - it's a little push your luck game where you are diving off a sub to collect treasure and go back to the surface but everyone is sharing the same air supply so if anyone gets greedy you may all drown. **Camel Up** is another similar suggestion (about betting on camel races.

- **For Sale** or **No Thanks** for a simple card game that can be addicting and is great for newbies.
Friday and Onirim. Plenty of variety there for a long time. Get well.
Star Realms (there is a solo mode with a booster if you want to be autonomous)

Love Letter

Vintage games, check craig's list if that's an option in your area

Check local swap meet groups on facebook

edit: adding more

Fluxx may also be an option, but it may not be your jam

Coup

Sushi Go

These suggestions might get kind of pricey but I guess it depends on the length of your stay and budget mindedness (and they are also all coop): Forbidden Island, Pandemic, Forbidden Desert

Just about any "travel" versions of games would probably be good, for example Catan has a to-go version.

edit edit: hope you get to feeling better soon, I know (from experience) that it is not very fun in there, though it may be necessary. stay strong.
Nuns on the run. Modify it to loonies on the run. They'll love it.
Huh, I was in a psych ward after attempting suicide. We focused on getting better, not on fun and games

Get well soon!

Edit: we also had zero access to computers or phones
If you like Concordia, you should definitely investigate some other Mac Gerdt's games, particularly **Navegador** and **Hamburgum**. If your group can support it, I've also heard great things about **Imperial**... though I have yet to play it myself. 
Lewis and Clark uses the same "your cards are your actions and you can get more cards" mechanism. Also, Rococo for the same reason.
I think Mombasa might be of enjoyment or Trajan.
I love games that have a hand of cards for choosing actions.  Some of my favorites are: **Lewis & Clark, Glass Road, Rokoko, and Broom Service**
I think Rokoko might be something for you. It have a similar deck building mechanic with the added depth that you have to choose 3 cards, that you then can use in a given turn. I really enjoy since you then really have to plan your turn ahead, and it offers great dilemmas since you properly want to do more stuff than you actually can. Defiantly one of my favorite games. 
Really depends on what you mean with similar. What do you like? the cards mechanism, the way it scores you stuff or the engine builder/map stuff? 

Most of Mac Gerdts games have this sort of mechanism where you can't select the same actions against and have some sort of cyclical thing. The rondel in games like **imperial** and i believe **antike** plays out a bit the same. There are also some other games which use a similar card mechanism like **Rococo** or **Mombasa**. 

If you prefer the economic build the map thing without much conflict though you might want to look at **Terra Mystica** or **Scythe**. 

Overall I think **Mombase** comes closest from a game by another designer, otherwise just some of his many other games which all share a fair bit in mechanics. 
**Terra Mystica** feels like it has similar qualities.
I think La Granja is a pretty similarly-weighed euro, though it plays pretty differently.
If you're looking to go a little heavier--Scythe. 

Spread your guys in the map to every so often farm resources from them to buy more guys and ultimately score based on your total area controlled multiplied by popularity. It adds combat and alternative goals and lots of other stuff, but at the core is surprisingly similar.
**Concordia** is fantastic. One thing that promotes the "competitive team puzzle" is that the information is essentially perfect. Also it has enough interaction that you are very vested in the decisions of other players. **Quantum** is a game that shares these two features, and very little else in common. I mention it only because it is the game that comes to mind in which I enjoy helping other people with their puzzle.
could be, but it sure seems like Z-Man does notoriously small print runs for all games not named Pandemic. They're slow as molasses when it comes to reprints too. 
>I'm trying to figure out if it is taking longer than normal for a new print run of games, because of the merger with Asomodée

Nothing to do with Asmodee. Z-Man are infamously parsimonious with their reprints.
Expansions by Z-man especially go out of stock for extended periods. It's the only reason I haven't bought Clash of Cultures because the expansion is pretty much essential to the game.
The Terra Mystica expansion will be back in stores early December.

I am friends with th designers of Akrotiri and they were told that they were planning to reprint Akrotiri "soon".  I'd imagine Q1 2017, but I don't know for sure.  I'll look into it, it's a fantastic title!
I both love and hate Z-Man. They have the rights to some of my absolute favorite games, but they have probably the worst record for reprinting games. I'd love to buy a copy of Ascending Empires and Atlantis Rising. Hopefully with the merger we'll see some movement on their older titles...
have had several bad experiences with customer service with z-man even though I met the guy at gencon, hopefully asmodee will keep them in line liek they did with ffg
Since Z-Man was purchased by FiloSofia, their track record for reprints has been HORRIBLE.
 
We can only hope that Asmodee gets them in line.  You can't be a good game business if you don't have good games to sell!  In a way, I hope that Asmodee just absorbs Z-Man, keeps the good games, and phases it out.  Z-Man hasn't been the same without the Z-Man!
Z-Man is horrible. Honestly. Catan 5-6 players ext. (all extensions too for that matters) were out of stock (in french) for a single year. *Worldwide*. Imagine any other kind of business doing the same thing. Half of my customers just didn't believe me. Just try and find one french catan right now on the internet. Chances are, you won't be able. 
I think it means:

* You can attack once per turn

* You can only attack something in the same room as you when you attack (unless you have an item that states otherwise)
We always assumed it means you can only attack once per turn. 
I'm fairly certain it means you only get to attack once a turn, and you need to be in the same room as the one you are attacking. Having left over speed should not get you another attack. Opponents refers to both monsters and the traitor/heroes.
I am finally working on the sequel to Paperback.  Tested it at BGGcon and players really liked it.  Should be Kickstarting in the spring.
**Paperback** looks great, but it would be hard to find people to play this in English, so I'm still waiting for the crowdfunding campaign for the German version.
I constantly hear that this is an exceptional word game above any other like it. What is about the game that makes it so? 
Literally the only word game I've ever played that isn't garbage. I should really get a copy just to avoid having to ever "play" Bananagrams again.
Really enjoy it although not much player interaction. I'm good at word games and bad at deck building, so it's the perfect game in that friends get the satisfaction of kicking my pants at a word game and will therefore play it again, and I get an ongoing challenge in a word game without having to have more linguistically able opponents. Everyone has wanted to play it again.
I still like the N that gives +2 cards next hand.

Really, I still play this constantly on my iPad during commute. It's relaxing and fun.

EDIT: Also this game let me know what tonsil is, so... good? I'm weird.
Just played this today. Introduced a new player who loved it. Such a great game. 
This is the only word game that I'll snap agree to play. I originally got it for a stay-in date surprise for my wife, and I think I'm a bigger fan of it than her.

Also the game scales well with up to the 5 player max, which is a colossal win in my book.
I used to be *really* interested in getting this but it being language dependent made me back off the idea. I don't live in a country with english as a first language and that feels like a really big detriment to the game. Would people agree with my assumption or does it play better than I've expected?
Love this game, hate the box. In fact a corner of my box broke this week :( Maybe some tape inside will help
The German PnP is still my go-to game to rope in non-gamers, since it is very easy to feel like you really do something and the deck building and scoring and card powers come just naturally in the first play. Fantastic game for me and my wife and every game group I played it with. We are up to 70 plays on it and no signs of dropping it. Definitely worth its money, solid 9/10 for us.
Opposite of most people here, I actually like word games, but this is the only deckbuilder that I enjoy.  While I understand that mitigating the randomness and strategizing around it is part of the point of them, the random hand draws of deckbuilding games always feel frustrating and arbitrary to me. For whatever reason drawing random *letters* on the other hand just makes more "sense" to me, and really lets me get into the engine- and combo-building parts of these types of games. For that reason, I'm a big fan.
Got hooked on the app after falling in love with Burgle Bros. Recently added Paperback to my Fugitive shipment. Great game. 
Millennium Blades!  Each "dollar" is a stack of dollars.  It really makes it feel like you are dropping a lot of many for the cards you buy thought the game.
Xia: Legends of a Drift System had some lovely solid triangular metal coins in even the regular copy of the game.
A friend's copy of **Scythe** has these beautiful metal coins that are so rad. I think he got it from doing a Kickstarter or something.
FAT STACKS! **Millennium Blades** has wads of paper money that fit perfectly with the game's sense of humor about collectable card games. A lot of people hate paper money in games, but this is just so fitting that it works.
Firefly has some of the highest-quality, double-sided cash i've ever seen.
I would say Splendor. Really heavy high quality poker chip type things. 
**Chinatown** has small, laminated replicas of US currency, just slightly altered for X,000 denominations.
The money in **Tesla vs Edison** is thick card stock and gorgeous:

https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/365/161/539120b4363125a7f437cade56900b3b_original.png?w=680&fit=max&v=1425255171&auto=format&lossless=true&s=6462326b6aa05626176281145bccfdbe
I use the metal coins from my copy of Orleans Deluxe for almost all my euro games.  
The only exception is for economic games like Panamax or 18xx where I use poker chips. 

The only game I have with nice money is Scythe's metal coins. 
**Dread Pirate**. It's a shame the game is so mediocre though (I mean, it's like two notches above Machi Koro, so it's not *awful*, but that's a pretty low bar to clear).

Or it may be a stretch to call it money, but the Gems in **Crossing** are pretty fantastic, they look nice and are satisfying to handle.
Viticulture and Scythe and the best coins in the hobby.
As far as style, I like Firefly's a lot. I am turning into the biggest fanboy. I wouldn't even call myself a *casual* fan of the show. 

Next year (supposed to be first quarter) they're releasing a set of the money that'll be the size of actual currency. I'm looking forward to it. Not that many denominations, though.

I bought a set of decent poker chips with demoninations on them for less than $30 on Amazon and use it to replace currency in almost everything. 
The collectors edition of Tokaido. Those metal coins are great.
The missus loves Splendor's coins, which have a solid weight.  Heavier than poker chips!
**Empires: Age of Discovery** has giant plastic coins. They are nice but for me it feels overproduced.
The Collector or something like that edition of Puerto Rico has real copper coins that are fantastic!
DEAL: American Dream of late. [Million dollar bills y'all](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2985733/deal-american-dream?size=large).
**1846** has good money, it's cardboard so it has a certain amount of weight and pretty rigid.
Brass second edition also comes with metal coins. 
Our copy of the **SmallWorld Designer's Edition** has some of the best metal coins I've ever seen. In fact, they were the metal coins that started us down the path of upgrading the money in a bunch of our games to metal coins.
The WORST money is Flea Market. 
Carson city has broken token upgrades with metal coins and they are by far my favorite currency.
Buccaneer had awesome treasure pieces...rubies, pearls, gold bars and barrels of rum
I really like the money in **The Networks**. Each token looks like a stack of $1million or $5million which works well with the TV channel theme. 

https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3160243/networks

I love brass's tiddlywinks.
Do custom jobs count? Someone's game set in rot3k China uses legit, real currency, from the time period. Beautiful
Firefly has money that is just so luxurious to the touch.  
In general, I despise paper money for games (**Millennium** **Blades** is an exception, because the dollar stacks do fit the theme of the game really well). If a game has paper money, we use poker chips.

Cardboard money is better. **Die** **Macher** is probably the best of these for style, since it's based on the real Euro. I also love the money for **Amun** **Re**, as the money is used as cards within the game.
**Black Fleet** has nice metal coins. Satisfying to drop in the table.

Also a fan of the yellow/golden discs on **Citadels**

Anything with cardboard tokens for money always makes me a little sad :(
**Eldorado** has [tiny replicas of large USD denominations.](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/705416/eldorado?size=medium)
The different "coins" in 7 Wonders Duel are shaped like they would be in the ancient times (meaning they're not round, but have a slight curvature to them). I thought that was a nice touch to an already amazing game.
**Black Fleet** has metal currency standard.  Not many non-ks games have that.
My favourite paper money would be **Firefly**. It's ridiculously good quality.

Not sure of my favourite overall.
I always liked **Lords of Waterdeep's** coins, as well as the coins in **Age of Empire's III: The Age of Discovery**
The guy who wasn't encumbered by enemies in his square felt stronger than Conan!
which Conan game are you talking about?
We just played the first scenario today. I was the Overlord.

Conan is a freaking beast. He almost did a one-shot on the pict warchief. Fortunately for me, the guy playing the mage decided to play aggressively too and my snake chewed him... and did not spitted him out. That was kick and brutal. Conan than was stalled by the snake and Shevatas had a hard time finding the girl.

At the end of round 7, conan ran away with the girl after he left his shield behind. On round 8, I've tried to stall Shevatas who had the head but it was not enough. He barely made it out. Damn it!

Fun game, but the setup is a pain in the ass. And the rules are atrocious. Good thing I had the 2.0 version in french on my iPad. I will have to fin a way to store all the components more efficiently.
Must one player always have to be the Overlord? I love the world of Conan but am apprehensive of the Overlord role in a 2p game.
Just got mine in the mail this week. What do you guys think about the rulebook and learning how to play from it vs advice for learning it through another source i.e. video online?
I freaking love this game. After every session you feel like you just participated in a movie - it's so cinematic. And win or lose, everyone has so much fun. I can't recommend this game highly enough. 
I think [Raptor](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/177639/raptor) would be perfect. It's exactly what you want. 
Yeah you basically just described Raptor. They will love it
[Triassic Terror](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135243/triassic-terror) is the one I recommend the most.

[Smash-up](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/122522/smash) has a few dinosaurs involved and won't break the bank. 

[Trias](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4249/trias) directly involves dinos and has dinosaur meeples! It can be difficult to find a copy, but there's a few floating for sale in the internet.

[Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/North-Star-Games-500-NSG-Evolution/dp/B00NP7EWNG) might be up his alley, even if it doesn't directly have dinosaurs, it still has the feel/theme of them.

[Evo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107255/evo-second-edition).  Each player controls a species of dinosaur and tries to survive climate change while fighting for territory.

Edit: this game is a bit expensive right now due to being out of print.
Thanks for all the suggestions! Some of these games are spot on but hard to find online. Placed a few bids on eBay so fingers crossed! 
JurassAttack - 2 player filler card game with heavy dinosaur theme and surprisingly deep gameplay for what it is.
**Forbidden Island**/**Desert** are decent light co-ops for families.
Lanterns is great. It's a tile laying game that was recently featured on Tabletop, so check that out for more info. I would also suggest looking into Lotus, which is a card laying game where you build flowers petal by petal. It's got some good strategy and looks great on. A table.
The Zooleretto and Colroretto games you may want to check out. Forbidden Island could be a good one as well.
I agree with the others that you should give **Forbidden Island/Forbidden Desert** a try!
>One problem that this game seems to have, is that after some time it's always the same. Is my assumption right or am I totally wrong about this?

That depends on how long 'some time' is. Bear in mind it is a light, approachable game that plays very quickly. There's a necessary limitation on depth, to make it quick and easy to play, but with the different modes and room randomization, I don't think it's a fair concern unless you sit down and play it intensively, over and over. That will of course bring similarities to the fore.
Eh, I'd say that every game might get repetitive after some time. Room 25 has got several game modes, you can play in coop, against one another, in teams... Recently I've bought an expansion for the game which makes it even more interesting. I'd say yeah, go for it, as r/flyliceplick said, it's very light and approachable. 
I've had it for a couple years now and I still enjoy playing. I'm not a super competitive person, so I bet that helps contribute to it's longevity.
I originally got Tokaido when I first started getting into board gaming.  I think its a great game to play with non-boardgamers, as the art is beautiful and  the simplicity makes it easy to teach.  That said, I agree with the criticism you read; it's too basic with too few meaningful choices for me to really enjoy these days.
Totally replayable, but not really a "hard core" gamer's concept of replayable.  I enjoy replaying it whenever I play it, but it's usually with non-gamers.  It's simply not a competitively themed game...  best played with a glass of wine (or tea)
Tokaido is one of the few games I feel the expansion (specifically Crossroads) really improves. There just aren't enough difficult choices in the base game to keep it engaging.  It's fine for playing with children or non-gamers, though.  So in that respect, yes, I would say it's a good choice for people in the mood for something simple.  
I am testing the iOS app, and I'm playing it probably 4-5 times a day, and enjoying them all.
I like it a lot, I got it when fairly new to the hobby years ago and still I introduced it to new players a couple of weeks ago and they all loved it. I must say that getting the first expansion called **Crossroads** is more or less a must, makes the choices and collecting in the game much more enjoyable.
It's a great game to introduce new gamers to the table, esp if you have a regular meetup or hold gaming parties often.  I own it and that's honestly the only time it hits the table for us.  That being said, I'm glad we have it for that reason.
A friend of mine owns it.  Personally I don't care for it, but we have several "non-gamer" types that love it and repeatedly ask to play it.  

I feel like the replayability would be quite low for a group of people who play lots of board games.  But it is certainly a fan favourite for newcomers.
I found it fun to play, I had it for 1.5 years. I really loved it. My partner didn't and my friends found it a bit boring. I, think, is a great game to play with non-boardgamers. I hope you enjoy it!
Its a very chill game, anyone can play and do well enough.

Best player intermingled with discussion and drinks.
It's a beautiful vacation hiding a nasty take that blocking game. Play aggressively in under 45 minutes if you know what you are doing with 5. 
I played it once and sold it. I got it to play with non gamers and they showed no interest. Couldn't have been more bored at the lack of decisions. They like other games with better choices that are simple. 

It's barely a game. At no point in my play did I see any reason not to just go to the next open space. I'm sure there could be a reason, but I will never know lol
The different characters add a little repeatability but it's only been broken out 2-3 times in our group. I still love it though and am hoping to snag the expansion this Xmas to open it back up to our players. 
It's got this pretty brutal economic engine that's hard to use. Once someone masters it, they will beat everyone, every time, until everyone masters it.

If no one at your table gets good at the economic engine, it can be played for a long time as a somewhat random candylandesque game almost (it's not *that* simple...but it's pretty simple).
If you could resell at a price that someone would buy then everyone wins. Someone who will enjoy it just bought it. You are a bit better off money wise. So why not. Sell if it helps you out. 
That's an awesome FLGS if they didn't hike up the price AND they're telling you to turn a profit if you can. Highly recommend flipping it and going back with the money you made to buy more games from that store.


On a side note, I will say that Agricola: ACBaS is an awesome game that fits in the realm of 2-player Patchwork. It's simple to understand but has a ton of strategy in it. There are a handful of other games in the 2 player spectrum that you could easily pick up 2-3 maybe even 4 of them and still have money left over after flipping this one. 


TL;DR - Don't feel bad about buying low and selling high. Use that money to buy your folks more games! 
Amazon is not accurate; bots are setting those prices and they tend to be too optimistic. Check *completed, sold* listings on eBay to see what you could actually get.

If it's a significant amount that's worth more to you than the game is, go ahead! That's supply and demand, and ACBAS will probably be reprinted.
Having sold a few games that are worth more than their MSRP value, just because something is listed as something, doesn't mean it will sell.  But, sometimes you do get lucky! 

The points your store made are very valid:  If money is tight, or you really want to profit over owning the game... just sell it!  However, keep in mind you have to factor in shipping and fees as well to your sale, which depending on where you sell it, you can mitigate that a bit. 

Should you sell?  There are lots of other interesting 2-player games to try, and you can always try the real thing (Agricola).  Or, give them an awesome game, since you bought it, and make sure they know that it's currently rare and out of print... they'll probably be even happier to hear that. 



 
Amazon is a site where people price hack board games. If you ever see something overly expensive there, there are often many other places selling it for less.

If you can arbitrage your find, do what you need to, just don't think of Amazon as a fair market value for games.
Gift it. 

I don't think they're worth as much as they are listed for on Amazon. Just quickly browsed ebay's sold section and it looks like used base game and expansions go for 80-100 or so altogether. Looks like sealed they are about 50~ or so each. I'm assuming yours are sealed but I doubt anyone would pay 200+ for them. Realistically, I think your looking at making 150 minus what you paid originally, shipping, packaging, insurance, fees and time.

What you're considering doing I essentially consider scalping. 

On the one hand, I wouldn't do it. I don't need to bilk a fellow gamer for a few bucks, especially around the holidays (not judging you, just wouldn't do it). Also, I wouldn't want to put up with selling & shipping it online and the risks that come with that. Lastly, I'm a little lazy (especially around the hectic and stressful holiday season) and if I have a perfectly acceptable gift in hand I would just gift it. 

On the other hand, $. It's been awhile since I've sold online but we couldn't get our money out for like two weeks after items sold. Double check how long it would take to get your money through whatever site you decide to use. Also, if not for you then this copy may have never made it out into the wild, it could have been trashed at some point. I would recommend selling locally if possible, could probably squeeze out a little more $ if you wait until shipping deadlines for Christmas have passed. 

Good luck whichever way you decide. Hope they like it or hope you make more than my estimates! 
There's a copy ending on eBay tomorrow that's currently bid at $20.52.  One ending Tuesday at $32 which is what I paid for it on Amazon last year.  The completed listings shows them selling at auction for around $30, with a couple buy-it-nows up to $60 with free shipping, the ones going for more include expansions.

Unless I'm making an absolute killing I don't sell games I like and want to keep.  Especially OOP games.  I know Z-Man and Mayfair are now part of the Asmodee umbrella, but Mayfair's name is now on Agricola while ACBAS was a Z-Man product.  Not sure how any of that may affect it getting reprinted, but I'm surprised it's not been by now.
Try The Compleat Strategist or The Uncommons.
I've heard good things about the 20 Sided Store in Brooklyn.
Complete strategist should have it. 

I would definitely stop by The Uncommons as well.   5 dollars to play all day weekday (10 weekends)  there with their fairly large board game collection.   Played time stories there myself.  
Where in the world are you?

If you're in Europe, check out [www.spielematerial.de](https://www.spielematerial.de/en/?___from_store=de) which has a great collection of pieces.

It's also worth finding cheap copies of rubbish games so you can cannibalise the pieces. I recently got a copy of Netzwerk, which is not very good, but only cost $5 and came with tons of wooden cubes, sticks and houses.
Go to r/tabletopgamedesign and check the links in the sidebar
I'd check your local FLGS. Mine (Labyrinth Games and Puzzles, DC) has whole bins of these sorts of pieces. You can pick and mix for cents.
Nothing yet. I ordered 2 games and 2 books on the 17th and still have not received a shipping notice. Looking at their FAQ it seems to run a tad slow during these Holiday Sale events.
I'm in the same boat. Placed an order 8 days ago, received an email with an order number, just saying my order was received. But nothing after that and no charges to my bank, either. 

And there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to follow up about the order. I placed a generic query with customer service, but not sure when/if I will hear back.

Seems like a really bad method to handle their holiday sales and I'm not really hopeful I will receive the order, in fact. 

But you're definitely not the only one.
Someone got a reply back from customer service that items will begin shopping on Monday.
Same situation here. I'm not upset about the delay per se - this is a big sale with a lot of orders for them to handle. I do think they'd avoid a lot of problems by being more up-front with the information about the delay and an easier way to track the status of your order.
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5ebkfr/has_anyones_asmodee_holiday_sale_order_been/) Thread was posted a few days ago on the same subject. OP recieved an email from FFG saying they get huge order volume and that they will begin shipping on Nov. 28.
I still keep my finished copy on the shelf. Once a year around the date we finished it we pull it out to play a game or two on out custom board. I have thought about getting the board framed and hanging it up in the game room though. 
Did you open the "Do Not Open. Ever."? You can probably get a couple plays out of that, if not.
That name though....ugh....
For any other non-Americans out there who are as confused as I was: the name only makes sense if you say "Zed" incorrectly.
Think of it as playing on how Germans stereotypically say 'the'. 
Hit zee Road. The German mispronunciation is a part of the American cultural zeitgeist. With the context of a zombie game it picks up another layer of meaning. Clever but I can see how it would be questionable because of all the references the title is making. 
Telestrations!  One of the funniest moments was when "Acorn" was read by a person with poor English "A Corn".  The more confusion the better.

If all 7 arent playing, you could play Ticket To Ride.
I strongly recommend **A Fake Artist Goes to New York**. It's like Telestrations meets Spyfall, with almost no language dependence. Everybody gets a sheet of paper with one word, and they take turns drawing a single line on a piece of paper. Just like in Spyfall, everyone has the same answer except one person who has a blank card. The goal is to figure out who is just pretending , while that player has to figure out what the drawing is.
You could try **Codenames: Pictures**, less language dependent than the original. **Sushi Go: Party** plays up to 8 and should work.
I'd say Resistance.  You'd think you wouldn't want to play a game that's all about talking with people that aren't comfortable speaking the language, but it is really good for getting people engaged in a fun atmosphere. (specially if you have one or two "assholes" in the group) 

I only say this because I had a girlfriend that worked in a lab with a lot of international students, (as was she) and they loved playing that game.  Any miscommunication people had just made the game even more fun.
[**Tsuro: The Game of the Path**](http://a.co/0i86gSX ) is a tile laying game that has no language involved and is very easy to pick up.

There is also [**Tsuro of the Seas**](http://www.target.com/p/tsuro-of-the-seas/-/A-15702821) which puts a different spin on the game.
**Bohnanza** is a classic negotiation game that transcends language. They don't need to know good English, they just need to make good deals. It plays 7 people very well.
Dixit has been very popular among my non english soeaking crowd. Dog is easy to explain with 4-6 players. 
Survive! is easy to explain and has no english text. Ticket to Ride is easy once you get the concepts down. 
We've enjoyed **With & Wagers** as long as your non-native speaker can ask and answer questions. The trivia is such that it's totally OK not to know the answer, and even when someone's way off on an answer they still have a good chance of winning based on their betting. It takes 5 minutes to teach and can be played easily in a lunch break. 
Mysterium could be good, i'm not sure how easy it is to communicate the rules (they're a little odd. Skip the betting mechanics and just do three guesses at the end).

But its dependence on one person actually being unable to speak is what should make this game good for your group.
not all are for multiplayer but adding to the list Ghost blitz, Spot it, Zombie dice, Carcassonne, Hanabi, Jenga, and Blokus. Apples to apples: picture edition requires only knowledge of one word at a time. 
Rhino Hero for the silliest fun adults can have at the office
**Fake Artist Goes to New York** is great with large groups that includes non-native English speakers. I played with this sort of group, and it went over really well (Chinese speakers wound up dominating!).

Plus, all you need to play is some markers and a big drawing pad.
We play Mascarade with an office group and it's popular, but usually only with 8 or more. Great with the expansion as the puppet master card gets people swapping seats, so may be good for a shy group! Zeus on the Loose is a recent favourite as well as its very quick as a filler. 
Slap .45 might work. It's for 7 players and usually leads to a lot of laughing without a ton of rules necessary to explain.
Ugg-tect doesn't involve actual language at all, but seems like a fun sort of party game
Maybe **Bang: The Dice Game**? It's a very fast and simple hidden identity game, that mostly has image based information.
**Between Two Cities** and **Cash N Guns** pop to mind as non-language dependent games that can play up to 7.
I'm biased BUT! Try Numenko. It plays like Scrabble but instead of letters making words you use numbers to make sums.  Everybody uses arithmetic in every walk of life.  And for the not so comfortable with maths there is Numenko in a bag which plays like Bananagrams.
Sushi Go! No words on the cards, very simple.
Picture picture?
Perhaps Scrutineyes. 
**BattleTech**.  You can even use the same terrain since it is hex based, but has a lot more depth.  Also there is **Battletech Alpha Strike** if you want more mechs with less rules.
Battlemasters? It was the predecessor to Heroscape. Has less terrain building though, just a tower and a few handfuls of fords, ditches, and similar. But the combat is interesting; the two factions are distinctly asymmetrical.
Magic Planeswalkers. About as close as you're gonna get 
Heroscape terrain is hard to beat.  Buy as much as you can and use it for anything and everything.
You might want to poke around some miniature wargaming subs. Warmahordes is probably a good starting point.
FROSTGRAVE! Quite an enjoyable tabletop rpg-ish game. The rules are under 20 bucks on Amazon and you can use any types of minis you have. 
You could look into getting Mice and Mystics. It's a co-op RPG that would sit well with younger audiences. My girlfriend and I have been playing through the core game and the expansions over the past year. The rules are pretty simple too.
1.  Mechs vs. Minions.  It may be hard to locate right now, but it fits the bill.

2.  Marvel Legendary.  Superheros are always fun, and based on your lists, this might be a good intro to deck building games.
**The Big Book of Madness**
Burgle Bros
This one's a bit different from your other games, but I cannot recommend Escape: the Curse of the Temple enough. [Shut Up and Sit Down](https://vimeo.com/72980922) did a good review, if you like what you see I've yet to play with someone who didn't enjoy themself.
While you can still get it you should take a look at **Space Hulk Death Agel** and see if it is appropiate for your son.  
It is a really good coop game that you can play solo very well.
Does your son like sword and board fantasy? If so literally stop what you're doing. Buy descent and get the companion app road to legend. You won't be disappointed. 
Pandemic Legacy is really awesome.

Edit: Accidentally submit without explaining. Legacy is Pandemic, except each time you play a game, the consequences of that game have consequences on the board, characters, and future games. There are 12 missions, one for each month, and each mission has a different objective. The box comes with a bunch of secret pockets and cards and the instructions tell you what to open before each game, depending on what happened in the last game. 
Ghost fight in' treasure hunters (aka geister geister shatsuchmeister) has an easy and hard mode and is fun

The Game, is pretty fun as well...there's a new hard mode deck that I've played maybe 40x now and still have yet to beat.
Mechs vs. Minions should be available before Christmas. I got it to play with my 11 year old son and it's getting nothing but stellar reviews.

If not, go for one of the Dungeons and Dragons Adventure Series games. My favorite is Wrath of Ashardalon, but they're all fun.  The others are Castle Ravenloft, Legend of Drizz't, and Temple of Elemental Evil.
Defenders of the realm is fun if he likes fantasy as a theme. It is a huge game that can really be expanded also. It may be slightly more expensive than the co-op games that you have now, but there is a lot in the box and it has an epic feel.
The new Arkham Horror LCG co-op card game is probably outside his age range unless he's really into spooky stuff.
Pathfinder is a fun RPG, might be a bit heavy for a 10 year old, but its still not bad and introduces you to the die check mechanic. 
I think you're probably right about **Castle Panic**, at least the base game. But **The Wizard's Tower** expansion would beef up the game to something he would enjoy. Much more strategy involved. 
Dark Moon.  It's co-op, but with a hidden traitor mechanic.  
**Star Trek Panic**?  It takes Castle Panic and adds some complexity.  I really enjoyed the one game I have played to date.
Just to name a few:

**Legends of Andor**

**Escape: The Curse of the Temple**

**The Captain is Dead**

**Dead Panic**

**Dungeon Fighter**

**Aeon's End**

**Dead Men Tell No Tales**
Thunderbirds!
Neat theme.  Cool bits.  Designed by Pandemic creator Matt Lecock.
Ghost Stories s great, but super hard to beat.
Time Stories also great, but maybe too mature.
**Project Elite**, **Mice & Mystics**, **Legandary: Marvel**
I would say Forbidden Island or Forbidden Desert would be good for y'all 
Fuse! It's one of my 10 year old niece's favorites. 
I think **Mysterium** should be fine for kids, it's basically Scooby Doo levels of spooky.

There's also the **Arkham Horror** LCG which is pretty good, but obviously that depends more on the child, I would have loved it, but then my first modern board game was Zombies!!! when I was like 11, so.

**Hanabi** is another classic co-op, a bit on the lighter side but makes a good stocking stuffer.
Have you tried the Pathfinder Adventure Card Games?

I just had a great Thanksgiving playing that with a nephew around that age.
Consider pandemic the cure.  Great game, and my son (9 in feb)  and i both enjoy it more than the original.  also maybe look at paperback, it includes a solo /coop mode. 
Thanks for taking the time to write all of that. Just watched SUSD's explanation of how to play IA and I'm really liking it. Going to find a SH one now.

Dreadnought was like a big robot thing like Robocop's Ed209. I think that's right, I only played SH once as a kid!
Well I've watched a gameplay vid of both and gone for Space Hulk right now, mainly because I run a school lunch club and it looks like the quicker game. Plus it is usually out of print.
Probably go for IA as a late Xmas present to myself.
Cheers all!
I've played them both a fair bit.  
  
Space Hulk is much quicker to set up and play, and the rules are pretty straight forward.   
You can easily get through several rounds of space hulk in an evening and get through the campaign book in a few sessions.  
That being said, once you've gone through the campaign book you've pretty much played it all.  
It does have goo replayability (trying different tactics, switcjing between who plays the gene stealers) but the missions all start the same.  
It's also 40k, so it's got that.  
  
Imperial assault takes time to set up and time to play, but is much much deeper than space hulk and far less linear.  
In an evening you may get through 1-3 rounds, depending on how quickly you get through them.  
Getting through a whole campaign can take a while.  
The rules are far more dense, but there's more going on so that's to be expected.  
Every play through will be different as your choices and randomisation will affect which missions you play between the story missions.  
And as with spacehulk you can switch who plays rebels and who plays Imps.  
Strongly recommend playing this one with the same people as often as possible.  
Plus, it's star wars. Vader is a bad-ass.  
Maybe dreadnaught is in reference to the class of power armor the Space Marines are wearing and the poor chap confused dreadnaught with terminator?  Heavy assault type armor.  It is big and bulky and explains why it takes a full move got turn more than 90 degrees and why you cannot pass another Marine in a corridor...love it.

Anyway, for your question, I have never played **Imperial Assault** but I have had more opportunities to play it that I have had to play my copy of **Space Hulk**.  I guess it might be the theme, but the Star Wars IP seems much more open and available to players than the WK40K universe.  Add to that the mass numbers of available expansions and I think **Imperial Assault** really jumps ahead.

Not to hate on my **Space Hulk**, I do want to add that GW blew component quality out of the water on the game.  The miniatures are excellent, the cardboard thick as hell, and the fluff in the manuals are great.  It just really needs an expansion.

Bottom line up front...unless you and your friends are huge WH40K fans, I think you'll get more play out of **Imperial Assault**.  And have fun!!
Check out Level 7 when you have the chance.
Scythe is a worker placement/resource management game. Memoir is a skirmish. You can think of Space Hulk as a scaled-down Memoir, if you wish. It has little in common with Space Crusade ("Dreadnought!") except the background. Imperial Assault is a very scaled-down "D&D like" game, and each player only controls one hero (except for the Imperial player who acts as a "DM" and controls all Imperial troops). More roleplay and a bit less skirmish, with more space for alternative routes and so on. Plus, it has a story unfolding as you play.
IMO space hulk's 1980s mechanics really show their age. IA is a much more engaging modern design.
I play both quite a lot.
I prefer IA as a whole. It's a lot more engaging I think.
Nope.  It's up to the Forensic Investigator to figure out which clue tiles to use for the weapon, and which to use for the evidence... and up to the Officers to figure out which clues are being given for each.

Try it out... it's not nearly as difficult as it seems.  We've found after many, many, MANY plays that the "good guys" win far more often than not.
When I explain this game to new players I always omit the difference between weapons/evidence for that reason.  "The murderer left two pieces of evidence behind, one of each color..."  This avoids players getting hung up on the non-existent difference between them.
Star Realms!
* **Dead Last** is a recent game with a traitor mechanic. [On Amazon now for exactly 20 bucks.](https://smile.amazon.com/Smirk-Dagger-S-D0062-Dead/dp/0986392014/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480168959&sr=8-1&keywords=dead+last) But it requires a minimum of 6 players.

* [**Coup**](https://smile.amazon.com/Indie-Boards-Cards-COU1IBC-Dystopian/dp/B00GDI4HX4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1480169123&sr=8-4&keywords=resistance+avalon) scales well from 2 to 6. It is a good game of hidden identities.

* **One Night Ultimate** [**Werewolf**](https://smile.amazon.com/Bezier-Games-ONUWBEZ-Ultimate-Werewolf/dp/B00HS7GG5G/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1480169277&sr=1-1&keywords=one+night+ultimate) / [**Vampire**](https://smile.amazon.com/Bezier-Games-VAMPBEZ-Ultimate-Vampire/dp/B013TRQSWY/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1480169277&sr=1-2&keywords=one+night+ultimate) are good games that work from 3 - 10 players. Good amount of bluffing and hidden identities.

* And then there's always the classic [**Resistance: Avalon**](https://smile.amazon.com/Resistance-Avalon-Social-Deduction-Game/dp/B009SAAV0C/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1480169538&sr=1-1-spell&keywords=resistance+avalong).

Edit1: Few other suggestions: **Bang: The Dice Game**, **Citadels**, **Mascarade**

Edit2: Formatting
The answer is ALWAYS Bohnanza. 
Bonanza is my pick. Non-stop trading.
**Red7**
Exploding Kittens for the cute cats! Sheriff of Nottingham is also fun and has bluffing but might be above $20.
Cheap game with little to no setup? ***Spyfall*** is a good one. Good social game with a traitor-like element. Certainly a fun one to have around and gets better with a rowdy crowd.
Love Letter

Welcome to the Dungeon is one of my recent favorites. It's easy to learn and very friendly for gamers of all experience levels. 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00UQZGG3E
**Bohnanza** is $14.14 on Amazon...  
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008URUS/  
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11/bohnanza  
2-7 players, no tiny pieces

**For Sale** is awesome for introducing to non-boardgamers. Takes less than 5 minutes to explain, and fun for all skill levels.
**Kitty Paw** or **Cat Tower** maybe 
**Smash Up** sounds like a pretty good fit. Very little setup/cleanup (basically setup is shuffling two decks together for each player and separating out at end). Dinosaurs also come as one of the factions in the base game. Plus if she later buys the "Pretty pretty Smash Up Expansion" she can play as Dinosaur-Kitty-Cats (you play as two factions mixed together). It isn't the best player scaling though - best with 3 or 4 players. $18.99 on Amazon right now.
Codenames.
Tides of madness. 
Sounds like **Happy Salmon** would be a good fit!  Looks like a kids game but it's great for parties. 

https://www.amazon.com/North-Star-Games-600NSG-Salmon/dp/B01D5CBK8A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480170829&sr=8-1&keywords=Happy+salmon
Roll for it!
it doesn't exactly match up with your friend's tastes but **Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** is a big game in a small box. It's under $15 as well. Maybe you can introduce a more "euroey" game to your friend with this.
I can recommend two games that are great with up to 6 players and I have personally played. Citadels which is about 17.99 on amazon right now and avalon the resistance which is just under 15
Check out love letter (the batman theme is my personal favorite flavor) it's a really fun, short game. It doesn't have a lot of pieces. (16 cards and some wooden tokens.) plus its not expensive. $10 - $15. You could also get the new Deluxe edition. That played up to 8, I believe. With some new roles. And the packaging and components are beautiful. The Deluxe version is about $20
You could get him Codenames: Pictures, which is right at that $15 point or maybe Dicemasters would be a good fit
[Fuji Flush](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/203430/fuji-flush) is good for higher player counts.
Netrunner! Supposedly core was on sale for $20 on amazon.
Big fan of Rummikub.
> Likes cute cats

Seconding **Kitty Paw** for this.
I would consider **Hanabi**, **Spyfall**, or **Codenames**
are they going to be primarily playing by themselves or with others?
I second Puerto Rico. Everyone should have it in  their collection. 
My vote would be above and below and Puerto Rico.
From that list, only one game really stands out as the true masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Only one game has been around over ten years while the rest are much newer. That game is also the one I recommend - **Puerto Rico**.

If you must pick another one from that list... Maybe **Mysterium**? It's light enough that they'd be able to play it with non-gamer friends. And it's completely different from PR.

I would personally recommend **Agricola** or **Power Grid** as the second game.

But those are all good games. No duds.
If you are looking for party type games I would recommend looking into Dixit, telestrations, and codenames as a good place to start. I have found these games work for every group I have tried them in and have always been a big hit.
My best advice would be to slow down on the buying, and try to play as many games as you can. You'll get recommendations for all sorts on here, some of which you'll probably hate, so it's a good idea to try to work out what sorts of thing you like.

Also, not to dismiss your purchases, but KoT and KoNY are very similar games and not many people would ever believe that both are needed in a collection, and buying an expansion, let alone two, before you've decided whether or not you like a game can be a bit dodgy. For all the praise that is heaped on it, I've never really felt any love for Carcassonne (other than it being a rather nice French town).
I'm somewhat new to the hobby as well, I've found party games are a good way to get friends sort of into the idea of playing, Werewolf is what got me interested and it works for most of my friends as well. If you're interested in something co-op but with a deception aspect incorporated, I really enjoyed Dead of Winter.
This depends a lot on the size of your group. Are you 3-4? 5-6? 8+?
King of Tokyo really needs the power up expansion to make it interesting, I found. 
**7 Wonders** is probably a pretty good starter game. Relatively simple to teach and learn, plays pretty fast and scales well from 3 to 7 players.
If you know the people well, Say Anything is a good party game. Wits & Wagers for a trivia game that doesn't suck. Time's Up: Title Recall if your group is pretty familiar with popular music/tv/movies/books/etc.

Sheriff of Nottingham is a Dice Tower Essentials game, where you will be able to bluff and bargain and everyone seems to have a good time trying to get their goods past the sheriff and into Nottingham.

I have Ticket to Ride and while it's good, I don't play it much. I'd rather play Royals, which has a similarish mechanic with the cards/set collection, but it's area control. Everyone who plays it with me seems to love it, whether it's friends or complete strangers at my local game shop. It's a Dice Tower Essentials game, too.

For nights where you have 5+ players, The Resistance is fantastic to have on hand. I prefer playing Deception, but Deception gets really good at 6+ players (though technically does support as low as 4 players).

There are so many... You should check out some of the Dice Tower Top 10 videos to find game ideas to research more. Play what you can, buy what you like.
I've had great success with Spyfall as a party game. Takes two seconds to explain and game time is as long as you want it to be. One drawback is the more players you have, the more useless the location map becomes (it's relatively important that every player can view it to discern what questions to ask). That said, if you play it a few times in one go, everyone develops a good feel for all the locations. 
**7 Wonders: Duel** is a fantastic redesign of 7 Wonders specifically for two players. It's worth checking out. I know there is a 2 player version of Catan but I have no experience with it.
**Onitama** is a great chess-like game

**7 Wonders: Duel** is great, tablau building(?) game, you take turns choosing cards building your civilization

**Castles of Burgundy** is also a great mid-weight euro for 2 players
Carcassonne was the game my wife and I first started playing together.   Even now it is one of our most played. 
If you want something chess-like **The Duke** is interesting.

My favourite couples games though are **Jaipur**, **Patchwork**, **Splendor** and **Pandemic**
In Essen we discovered the game  **Ekö**, it is designed for 2-4 players. With 2 players it ist very chess-like and strategic and when we play it with more than 2 player in our playgroup there is always an interesting dynamic that the weaker players unite against the strongest one.
Someone already suggested **Onitama**, which is amazing, so I'll mention **Karuba**, **Kahuna**, **Jaipur**, **Battle Line**, and **Star Realms**.
Patchwork for sure
star realms
It would easier to include the whole game state in a table within the email.
I'm potentially interested but agree with /u/MrAbodi about it being easier to have it all digital. I wonder if we could hack together a quick interface (I'm thinking even something decidely low-tech like a Google drawing) to handle the move-making. That would be better for me because I bounce between work and home and could make moves more often during the day if I didn't have to consult my copy at home for each move.
Hit me up. Totally down
SoB feels way more intimidating and sandbox-y to me than Gloomhaven. Gloomhaven is a huge amount of stuff in one box, but A) it feels like it will require a lot less pre-planning and work to set up and play than SoB, and B) there are still plenty of ways to play the game without feeling lost, or like you have to be a GM (gamesmaster).

Gloomhaven has fewer miniatures, none of which require assembly (in stark contrast to SoB); Gloomhaven uses standees for all monsters, which allows for it to hit the table more quickly and for a wider variety of monster types without requiring that you shell out cash for expansions and more minis. 

Gloomhaven doesn't use dice - uses card decks of attack modifiers instead, which allows for more tailoring of your character in regards to RPG-esque character development.

Lots of reasons why Gloomhaven is more practical for me and why I'm more excited about it. 
My vote would be gloomhaven, purely based off my experience with the companies. Gloomhaven puts out updates all the time, flying frog will pretend you don't exist. Also have a problem with ff for them screwing up the last expansion for lnoe. (Manufacturing issues, not gameplay wise)  

Maybe they've gotten better, (which I doubt, from reading SoB where's my stuff threads) but I don't think I'd ever trust them with a $100 on a promise.   

My complaining aside, SoB does look interesting to me, but my so doesn't like the theme, so, problem solved for me.  
Is there any reason why you would late pledge for gloomhaven instead of just waiting for it to hit retail?  I would really like to know cause I'm interested in gloomhaven but figured I would just wait for it to be released.

On another note, SoB looks great, but I've heard of problems with there past kickstarters, and apparently there are people still waiting for their pledge to arrive from their last kickstarter.  The company doesn't seem to have the best customer service record so......back at your own risk I guess.

Another option to consider is Sword & Sorcery by Ares games.  Should be getting released very soon, maybe January or February,  and is a lot of dungeon crawl packed into a box.  Apparently it follows the Galaxy Defenders battle system (never played it so can't comment) and has a solo mode with characters that improve and stuff.  Last I checked they are still accepting late pledges.
There are two other versions of Shadows of Brimstone currently available...
if you have a regular group, Kingdom death monster reprint kickstarter. look it up.

I got both core sets of SoB almost a year ago and just prepurchased Gloomhaven a few months ago.  Truth be told, I don't know that much about Gloomhaven and I'm trying to keep it that way.  I like the details I know and want to keep the rest a surprise.

As far as SoB though, it is a really solid game.  I have one campaign running solo where I'm playing 2 characters simultaneously.  It works just fine but I also read the rules completely through 3 times and played a bit of a multiplayer campaign before launching into it so I was very familiar with the game.  It's a LOT to keep track of with just a single character.  Obviously running multiple by yourself doubles the effort.  But that really shouldn't get to be much of an issue until you get a bit more leveled up and have a ton of gear and upgrades to juggle.  Using some character sheets from BGG helps.  

So while SoB is a lot to keep track of, I'd say if you're used to running solitaire games it shouldn't be much of an issue, at least not until you're reaching end game.  

I would not recommend playing as a single character, even though the game does allow for it.   
I'd vote Shadows just because of the obscene amount of stuff you get for the price. SOB is a fantastic game but I just stumbled across it in my FLGS.  Cut to a year and a bit later, I've spent damn near a thousand bucks for extra enemies and extras that came with the mine cart pledge of the original.  I don't think you'd be out that much savings if you put off Gloomhaven for 6 months or so.
If American games like Shadows of Brimstone and Gloom haven interest you, the kickstarter of Kingdom Death Monster might interest you.

That is, if you don't mind getting creative with putting the minis together...
Buying Dixit Odyssey is probably your best bet. 
Only way to get one is to make your own.  Not really a market for one due to the fact that insert that comes with latest printing of dixit holds base game plus 3 expansions which is enough for most people
I don't normally just drop a title and run, but Kemet would be good. Two- to five-player battle game about controlling areas of the board, developing your armies' powers in unique ways, and taking advantage of non-obvious openings in the other players' strategies.
I don't see any dexterity games there.  People seem to really like Flick Em Up, and Rampage, although Pitch Car looks far more interesting to me.  Crokinole has been around for a very long time though, if you want something time tested and awesome.

Ticket to Ride: USA is a great one and very simple to pick up and play. I highly recommend it.
Above and Below has storytelling elements in it and a few other things. Quadropolis is also fun.
A good tactical miniatures game with a campaign would be a good fit. I love **Imperial Assault** or **Descent.** people will say the theme is the only change but I believe there is room for both. The theme makes it feel different enough to me at least. Regardless they are both amazing games if you can have a group and play well with two as well. 
Zombicide: Black Plague, Descent, Codenames, and Coup.
**grand austria hotel** and **istanbul** both sound right up your alley and are both very solid games (both in my top 10!). :)
Le Havre is a fantastic game with simple rules yet complex decisions. It is one of the few games I rate a 10 on BGG.
You seem to be missing a bit of classic grognard styled wargames... were talking historical simulation of military conflicts.  There are too many to mention, and there are a lot of choices.  Battles of Gettysburg, Command and Colors Ancients, Chandragupta (Great Battles of History), and so on are all possible examples.  Head over to /r/wargaming or /r/hexandcounter if you want to ask for a first wargame.

I recommend trying print and play and head over to wargamevault, then grab something like Agricola: Master of Britain and make a copy yourself ($12 plus materiels) or go to Hollandspiele and buy a copy ($30 plus shipping).
I'd take a look at Mysterium. 
**Samurai Spirit** does up to 7 players, and is very simple to play. The rulebook is a nightmare to understand, though, watch the Watch It Played on YouTube instead.
You have to go into advanced options, but you can search a specific mechanic and player count on bgg. Here you go.

I think I only have 3 co-ops that go up to 6 players:

**Commissioned** is like Pandemic but based on the New Testament.

**Flash Point: Fire Rescue** also goes up to 6.

**Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective** can handle 6, but I'm not sure if that's ideal.  

Others you might be interested in:

**Mystery of the Abbey** -- Like clue, but not co-op

**Shadows Over Camelot** -- Co-op, but it has a hidden traitor

**Escape from Aliens in Outer Space** -- Hidden movement and secret teams


Suspicion is similar to Clue. Might be worth researching. Plays 6 max.
***Codenames*** and ***Spyfall*** both support 6 players and are very beginner friendly. Can be a party type game for sure. If you like Sci-Fi ***Cosmic Encounter*** (with an expansion ) can support 6. Play with green aliens until people get it. Cosmic is my personal favorite game overall.

Also what would be scary? ***Betrayal at House on the Hill*** is a campy "horror" movie. Pretty self aware game but some parts would be scary for some people I think depending on the people. I personally find it like a game where you play as the cast of Scooby-Doo but it is like Cabin in the Woods at the same time. If it sounds interesting I can give some spoiler free overview.
**Castle Panic** is a light coop also available with a Star Trek theme.  They may find it "too simple" when compared to pandemic.

**Elder sign** set in h.p. Lovecraft lore might work for your group but game will run past the hour mark.


I know a lot of newcomers who've enjoyed playing Avalon or Sheriff of Nottingham a lot. They are relatively simple and the interaction between players are in focus, instead of game rules. 
Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective 
Check out "TableTop" from Geek and Sundry on YouTube. Wil Wheaton plays a bunch of board games with random folks. You will pretty much be able to tell by the length of the video how long the games last and he gives a brief description of each game at the beginning

Maybe just stop messing with your wishlist right after the largest shopping day in the year?  

Pretty sure it's set up that way to prevent you from duplicate purchases, and by default only shows you the warning if they think you're going to purchase it.  

So, if by trying to share the link, the item was in your cart, or you add to your wishlist that way, could very well of happened.  


I stopped using amazon wishlist for board games because of something similar to this. My fiancé used my prime account to purchase Castles of Mad King Ludwig as a surprise once (she told me she was going to surprise me with a board game, so I kept away from checking my order and what not to maintain the surprise). However, it removed Mad King Ludwig from my wish list. It makes sense why it would do this, but I didn't give it any thought before looking through the wishlist and subsequently noticing it was missing. I use notes or a list app called Wunderlist that I share with people now instead.
I can check my copy when I get home.  If you don't hear from me in a couple days, send me a PM to remind me.

Fun game!
Also here's an online web app that simulates the Automa cards while your waiting for your cards.

http://viticulture.noesia.net/Automa.html
There was a recent thread about this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5dvcje/got_viticulture_ee_today_in_the_mail_and_the/?ref=search_posts&st=IVZTWIJN&sh=9004d438
Since there is almost no information about this game, I'm going to asume you are the creator of th game.  Can you talk more about how it plays?  Reading the description in bgg, it seems like it would be a real mess, what with trying to cooperate but without talking, making noise or giving any visual clues to each other.   
I once had a game where we were on a space station. One guy was acting kind of suspicious, so we asked him "how much education did you need to get here" and he claimed not much. We thought he was nailed for sure, but then he started answering spot on.

"Where do you live?"
"Here, obviously"

 "How often do you go back home?" 
"Its been a few months, we are kind of isolated." 

"Do you get out often?"
"Not really, it's kind of dangerous"

Meanwhile he was asking us really weird things like our favorite fruit, favorite bird, how we feel about the guys in charge. 

We eventually just accused him and he was shocked. He proudly displayed his card showing he was not a spy.  He was on a pirate ship. We screwed up the deck, and pirate ships are shockingly like space ships. Must've been on the firefly.
I was the spy once and the location was the space station. My friend starts it off and just asks me, "How's the weather?"....."A little rainy"
I once added a 3rd Cylon card in a 6 player game of battlestar galactica. Couldn't understand why we were still failing the crisis cards when one cylon had revealed and the other was in the brig.

Needless to say we lost....but only just.
My favorite was when we finished a round and one player goes to the bathroom. The dealer pulls out the spy card and deals it to them, then the rest of us just ask arbitrary bullshit questions the entire time.
Hahaha. What were some of the questions and answers?
I believe this is an actual variant on BoardGameGeek. I'd like to try it sometime, but Spyfall doesn't get to the table often enough for it to happen accidentally.
Yeah, we have this as one of our bags on purpose. We love when it comes out :)
A friend did this to us playing A Fake Artist Goes to New York (which I highly recommend) and we ended up drawing a very.... interesting and confused picture. Great game if you haven't played it btw.
We played, and one of the first questions was "How many tickets did you sell?"  It became quite memorable because the person answering was working coat check, and thus gave away tickets but didn't sell them.

Well, next round, and every round that followed, that was the first question.  It straight up revealed a spy that tried to say they were selling loads of tickets to the Space Station.
We did this intentionally once (only the organizer knew). We found that everyone was quite quick to come up with a question, each of which was very vague. The answers were also fast and generic.
That sounds hilarious, thanks for sharing! :-)
We had the same thing happen and also made a spy bag.  Great great fun
I've played some rounds like this before. It's a lot of fun to throw in a round of all-spies on purpose and see where it goes! 
My best Spyfall game was when I had been the spy for 5 games in a row. On the 6th game when I was the spy again, I couldn't take it. Before we even started, I said "I'm the spy and we're on the Submarine"... We were on the submarine, it was the best.
It's such an awesome game! And the only one I've ever played which is enjoyed to the same extent by casual and seasoned gamers alike!
Such a fun game once everyone gets the hang of it. My youngest sister is so good at being the spy that there were multiple games where we were convinced nobody actually got the spy card. 
We played it as well. 3 minutes waiting for someone to ask a question. I'm staring at the timer tick down. "I don't know what to ask!"

Then we put it away and played 6nimmt instead.
My friends and I played a game of werewolf where the card wasn't initially dealt out, but replaced by the DM later. Good times were had.
I have only played the mobile version and in one of our first games we ended up somehow with like 3 spies and everyone was just really confused such a fun round tho.

Edit: ah there was also another round where I there was 1 spy and 2 different locations for some reason. I was the only person in the 2nd location so everything I said led them to believe I was a spy. Such a fun round.
Good times.
Did you buy additional spy cards to do this?
I had no idea this was an actual board game, I've only played the digital version. Cool! 
This reminds me of an amazing laugh we had one of the first times playing Secret Hitler when when the Hitler card didn't get added to the pile and we just had a team of fascists. 
One time, I intentionally removed the spy, and just watched and laughed as everyone else got progressively more and more confused that everyone else seemed to be legit.
"Is there sand?"

"I mean if you brought sand..."
I occasionally troll people in social deduction games so I'll have to try this one next time.
I feel like that should just be one of the baggies by default just to throw people for a loop!
Well if you're down for a bit of a drive there's Nan's comics and games off 59 and shepherd. This would be going towards downtown Houston though. There's also Asgard games which sells mostly miniature games but is a cool spot. 
Not really. I live here and I order stuff. There will be a Dragon's Lair opening on the north side soon though.
I see you point, I'be been frustrated at this as well.  However, let me point out a few things to help temper patience...

You mention they are "non-board gamers".  I'm unsure if you mean they are gamers (video, arcade) or they just aren't gamers period.  Provided by the context of your words, I presume you mean they don't play board games.  Does it surprise you that folks who play video games like their technology?  It doesn't to me.  

What if they weren't gamers period?  Our society views that smartphone as an extension of their body.  In an era of FaceTime, text messages, and social media alerts being pushed to our fingers through the phone, it's not surprising that they are distracted.

The challenge now is how to overcome this.  How do we captivate their interest and attention?  I have to ask, what games were you playing?  Why did you choose them?  How were people responding to them?  

I'm not suggesting you're a bad game host, but that job is a tough one.  Partially on evaluating what your audience likes, partially for the titles you own or have access to, and partially on the time and environment.  To note, I used to manage F2Z's Southeast region's volunteers.  I'm used to teaching these guys how to do a compelling playthrough or demo.

Anyhow, my thoughts.  Know your audience well.  If you think you can hold their attention for 60-90 minutes in a game (with non-board gamers), I'd think twice.  Adult attention spans are short.  With rules explanation, simple is king.  Keep it short and to the point.  Don't lose them here as you bog them down with 20-30 minutes of rules.

When I run events (or at holiday gatherings), I start with the filler. My go to fillers include real time and hands on games.  I really like Escape: Curse of the Temple because it's quick to learn, it's 10 minutes of constant and active gaming.  Most groups want to play again after th first game.  You want a hook to barb them.  A 3 minute rules explanation and 20 minutes of real time gaming helps them forget about the phone.

Second, I pull out a dexterity game with little down time.  Lately, that's been Junk Art.  I would modify the game to play something like Montreal, Indianapolis, or Monaco.  This reduces down time and keep pieces in their hands.  Plus it's really fun!  A few cities would eat up 30 minutes of time.  By now, they haven't played with their phones.  Call for a break (refresh beverages, check your facebook, etc).  Tell them, when you come back you'll need their undivided attention.

Pick a third game, I would not suggest anything with down time.  Down time invites the phones.  I would think of something that requires constant interaction.  Social deduction are good for this.  Some party games are good for this.  Cooperative are good for this.  I would avoid games with long turns (many of my favorite euros take 10 minutes to go around the table).  Use your discretion with the group.  What is it that they are into?  Can I find something to link here?  I'd try to keep it under an hour, but that's your call.

At this point, you have had 2 30 minute game sessions and 60+ minute session.  People may be spent.  Booze, turkey, getting sleepy, etc.  I'd scale down to another filler if the group is ready to call it.  I would suggest Qwixx or Rolling America (small box, easy to teach/learn).  If they are primed for more, prepare another game or play the last one again but change it up a little (not by adding an expansion).  

Many folks like the idea of board gaming.  As the event's GM, you have an important responsibility to keep them engaged and having a great time.  Some forethought really makes this easier.  Beating people's attention span is the toughest thing.  Find ways to have them moving, keeping their hands busy, and laughing while doing so means you'all have more successful gaming sessions.

Best of luck!
This is startlingly true, but not all non gamers (fortunately) suffer from this problem. It really comes into light during tabletop, when people just pick up phones out of habit.But down with the cell phones at the table, seriously.
No phones at the table rule. Be polite to your fellow gamers and give the game your attention.
It's not just non-gamers. One of my close friends who plays and buys the most games of all of us literally never puts down his phone during games unless it's something where it's completely unavoidable, like Bohnanza or The Resistance or something. Pretty much all of my friends game with their phones at the ready, actually, but this particular friend stands out in his utter reliability to be on his phone. It's... pretty damn annoying to be honest. He's generally pretty good about keeping an eye on the game so that he's not caught unawares when it's his turn, and he generally takes his turns quickly, but the fact that he's on his phone all the time means he doesn't really participate in or initiate much table talk. Makes it hard to feel like the gaming is a social experience. 

I'm super screen-addicted myself in my daily life, but I make a very deliberate effort to keep my phone off the table during games. While I hope I would have developed that habit anyway, out of courtesy, I think one of the reasons I've become "disciplined" with regards to phones is just a practical thing. When I first started with board games, I was the one that introduced almost everybody in my group to games in general and also taught all the rules for new games. If I wasn't enthusiastic and focused, I couldn't expect a table full of new gamers to be either, and I also wouldn't be able to catch rules mistakes or give guidance when they overlooked something. I don't really take that role very often anymore, as all of my friends are seasoned gamers now, but the attitude stuck.
If I have to bring out the phone, it's because the game has too much downtime
I feel like people who previously were heavy into videogames have an easy time to get into boardgames, as long as the competitive aspect is retained. For family members you might be better off not playing the overly complex and "nerdy" boardgames, since they would tend to just flat out reject the game as soon as a slightly difficult rule or concept appears. (Though I can't speak for your family).  If attention span is a problem, consider playing shorter games, but play them several times.
I think you'd enjoy these true classics:

* **Power Grid** - An economic/route-building game with auction elements. Compete with other players to electrify the most number of cities. Very strategic as you'll need to out-think and out-bid your opponents for the best routes and resources. Consider buying the deluxe edition.

* **Puerto Rico** - A role selection game where you compete with other players on the game board while optimizing your own player board with plantations and structures that will help you achieve victory. Very strategic and very fun.

**Agricola** is also a great suggestion that has been made already.
**Broom Service**, **Acquire**, **Tragedy Looper** -- Strategic games with a board that will still see a lot of direct player interaction.

**Scythe**, **Brass**, **Alchemists** -- Heavier strategy games requires planning. These are more intense and in general are more "heads down". Not multiplayer solitaire, but you'll spend more time thinking than making your opponents' lives difficult.
Kemet or Cyclades?
#Agricola

The theme is spot on (build a farm), it has cards that add needed variability but you only ever draw 7, and the strategy comes from managing scarcity.  Scarcity of time, food, and resources.

And your opponents can block your plans since it is a worker placement game.

I haven't played it in a big group, but allow 30 minutes per player.
**Forbidden Stars** is fabulous. A really fun game of capture the flag in space. 
Broom Service, Covert, Quadropolis, Tobago, Viticulture.
You shuffle all the terror cards together except for abductor specific cards. These are removed unless playing with the specific abductor pictured on the card. Cards from each abductor pack can be identified by an icon in the corner of the card. 

I pulled all this info from [here](http://www.vanrydergames.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Abductor-Pack-2-Full-Rules.compressed.pdf), sorry if I got anything wrong. I only have the base set. Looks like you'll probably have to separate them by icon and look up the individual packs for rules.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dPaCFJDIcA I used this guy (Ricky Royal) to learn mage knight.  Here's the link to his hostage negotiator video.  Does a good job setting up and explaining things.  
That seems a bit like a waste of money to me, but I guess you're more of a collector then.

Say what you will about the game, but they do some funny stuff.
I don't understand why the seconds per dollar has been going consistently down. Earlier today a dollar bought you more than 2 seconds, now it buys you .6.
For 21 hours of digging, I would have thought the hole would be larger.
Maybe they'll find Jimmy Hoffa.
Not as funny as the bullshit, but I still like it.
What kind of [hole in the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yShvgXZQBTshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yShvgXZQBTs)?
I'm not sure what to think. 
The money they make certainly doesn't go to help them sit a hole... Maybe some of it... The rest of it is profit,  courtesy of morons who waste their money on garbage like that. 
They start shipping orders Nov 28
I haven't played Flip It, but games my SO and I reach for when we want a quick, light game are Star Realms, Galaxy Trucker (current favourite), Hanabi, Flash Point Fire Rescue, and Sushi Go.
I haven't played Flip, but games my wife and I reach for when we want a quick, light game are: Dragonwood, Ascension, Beyond Baker Street, Patchwork, Jaipur, and Mouse Guard: Swords & Strongholds.
Seven Wonders Duel is not complex if you don't over think it and can be played fairly quickly. The more you play the more you will discover the depth of variability and how deep a game it will become.
**Holmes:  Sherlock & Mycroft**

2 player only but I'm a fan.
Think about the cards with coffee cup symbols do and what each of them do and I think you'll answer your own question.

[spoiler](/s "Red coffee cup cards steal coins from other players all game long. This is payback")

Keep in mind players are limited to ONE EACH of the major establishments.
Unbalanced cards and subpar gameplay? Welcome to Machi Koro 101.
Machi Koro is giant unbalanced things applied against one another. You're not misinterpreting it, the game is just that swingy
**Space Hulk**
X-wing or Imperial Assault would be my suggestions. 
Prepainted or you paint it?  Single piece or assembly required?  What about miniatures appeals to you?  Got any friends that play already?
Cooperative or competitive? Battles or Dungeon Crawling or Other?
My votes go to **Zombicide**, which is a co-op zombie survival game, and **Shadows Over Camelot**, a co-op Knights of the Round Table game.
Space Hulk or X-Wing.
 Arena of the Planeswalkers is a fairly light tactical miniatures game but is very cheap to pick up.
Miniature wargaming like infinity or gates of antares?
**Claustrophobia** is really cool. It was on sale through Asmodee recently (the FFG sale) for 30 bucks.
I really like Firestorm Armada the movement rules can make it take longer but I really enjoy how it works
**Conan**!
Space Cadets: Away Missions

Miniatures, quick set up, easy but not too light rules. One of my favorites!
Because a very limited number people have played it yet, and fewer at the time when they were updated. Even if it's highly rated, it doesn't have a big player base to give those weight.
It's a great game. It's not without its faults, but yeah... I think it could possibly make it onto the Reddit Top 10. It needs more time, however. Not everyone on Reddit has played it, and not everyone here rates their games on BGG, and that sidebar is only updated occasionally. 
Sorry, but this doesn't surprise me at all. 

Not only was it a limited print run, but also, having played it - it's a very disappointing experience.

The cards you play only synergise in very limited ways so you don't really get a chance to build towards any meaningful "engine". I didn't feel there was much meaningful interaction between the players, so the downtime felt lengthy. The decisions were never particularly meaningful (you either did a thing or did a less good thing). The play time was long, but shallow.

It's not the worst game I've played, but it's definitely one of the highest hype to disappointment ratios I've seen in a while...

Scoville is a game about planting, breeding, picking and selling peppers. 
Have you ever played Agricola or any of its variations like the Family edition or such? I like it more as a agricultural game than Viticulture and I think it has more depth and breadth. Its well liked too among the wide majority of people I show it too.

That depends if he hasnt already played or if its hard for him. Think about it and look into the Family version too.
**Herbaceous** would fit but it's not out until spring. Maybe for next year?

/u/r2d8 getinfo
**Arboretum** is a wonderfully thinky card game about planting trees.

**Agricola** is the quintessential medieval farming game :)

Other games that have farming elements I highly recommend are **Scythe** and **Castles of Burgundy.**
How many people should it be for? If exclusively 2 player is fine, the king of cute, simple animal husbandry games is **Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small**.
**Mi Tierra: New Era** ?
Viticulture is great, but if you would rather stay away from worker-placement, don't get it (don't get Agricola or Fields of Arle, either).

As for other non-WP options, what about Lotus? Or possibly Cottage Garden (I haven't played it).
Fields of Arle is a 2 player game that you might want to look into. I got it as a gift and have been waiting to play it, but from all the videos and rules review I have done it seems like a great game. 
**At the Gates of Loyang** - it has farming theme, its multiplayer solitaire with strong emphasis on optimization.
**Lotus** perhaps?
Good work with the list. You have some really solid suggestions in there.
This is great! I also found this--Werewolves of Stars Hollow. It's a mashup of Gilmore Girls and Werewolves/Mafia, and we haven't stopped playing all weekend! [Check it out here]
(https://www.etsy.com/listing/475123240/werewolves-of-stars-hollow-game)

I feel like [Tides of Time](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176229/) and its Lovecraftian sequel, [Tides of Madness](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/195544/tides-madness), would be great additions to the list. Especially since they're both small and inexpensive, perfect for stocking stuffers!
Haha, wow. I totally backed **Multiuniversum** and didn't realize it was so small! Nice. Also, **Coup** should fit, right? I believe it's close in size to **The Resistance**. I was thinking of buying it as a stocking-stuffer for a friend (although we have bigger stockings too).
Wow, that's a really great list!

I grabbed **Zombie Dice** for Thing 1 (Age 11) and **Dragonwood** for Thing 2 (Age 9). Didn't see them on your list, so you may want to include those as well.
Awesome list!
Awesome!! Additionally, **The Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction** is one which got listed on Dice Tower's stocking fillers for this year, and it's about the same size box as those in the **4 Seasons** image.
Great list! **Fuji Flush** would also be a great addition.
I would add Zepplin Attack by Evil Hat. Quick deck builder, and comes in a fairly small box. 
Hey one little correction. You have Brew Crafters linked but Brew Crafters the travel card game on the image. Those are two different games, with Brew Crafters weighing in outside the stocking stuffer category. 
Great list!

Some of our favorites that would be stocking stuffer sized that you could check out are "Just Desserts", "There's a moose in the house" and perhaps Jaipur. The first two are very light and silly filler games.
Arboretum?

If Bill Gates is filling your stocking, sure!

Great list. You gotta get 3 Wishes in there
what a great list.  Thanks!

I bought Chrononaughts after reading this his thread...hope the kids like it! At least it might teach them some history
Roads & Boats can be quite cutthroat at times, but it does have a four player map where everyone has their own little map to work on that isn't actually connected to any others! There's still a bit of a wrestle over points in terms of monument building, but otherwise it's the purest 'multiplayer solitaire' I think I've seen in a game.

Pretty good solo variant too, if you like games that are effectively point optimisation puzzles; there's no randomness at all, so if you take the same moves on a particular map, you'll get the exact same result.
Agricola can have cutthroat competition.  What would happen in your group if someone paid attention and took all the reed before you could make an extension, or cleared our the fishing hole just to spite you?
Maybe **Castles of Burgundy**? At least I don't play particularly competitively or cutthroat.
I would suggest Caverna and Roll for the Galaxy.   Caverna and Agricola are very similar but Caverna is even less directly competitive.  Roll for the Galaxy is very much multiplayer solitaire.
**At the Gates of Loyang**: 

* multiplayer solitaire 
* strong emphasis on optimization
* medium weight euro game
* one of the best solo board games
Agricola can be extremely cutthroat - it might not be what you're looking for. 
**automania** is a recent favorite. there is tile drafting, so someone may snatch up something you need/want. also there's a bit of a race in terms of producing better cars faster, but everyone is still kind of doing their own thing. **grand austria hotel** is good as well, and **istanbul**. the interaction in all of these is "indirect", so any messing with other people is usually incidental, not agressive.

disclaimer: most euros can potentially still be pretty savage.
As far as the group solitaire category goes, I would recommend Roll for the Galaxy.  IDK if you can categorize it as euro, but its definitely not Ameritrash.  While the game play is entirely dice based, there are enough ways to mitigate the dice roll to not feel like you're total beholden to what  comes out of your cup.  Also, the special powers you get as you build out your engine keep multiple plays from feeling too similar.  

There doesn't have official solo play, but there are solo variants on BGG.
Our four year old has been winning a nofarmers variant of Carcassonne much of this year. We used tile matching without scoring the first time, to demonstrate the mechanics and tile laying rules. He requires one or two suggestions a game now, but he's played between 30 and 40 times. 
I think the base Carcassonne without the farmers would work well. I've not played the Star Wars version but if he's a SW fan he'd probably enjoy that one even more. Labirinth is also a great game, haven't played in a couple of years but it does work great with younger kids as well. Of these three, Carcassonne has the most possibilities in terms of potential expansions down the line (so in years to come), it would probably be the one I'd choose.
dad here with a 5 and 7 yo.

Top 5 games we BOTH like to play. All are a bit on the short side of 30 minutes. I don't know any game that takes an hour to play that kids will understand and sit through.

* Labyrinth
* King of Tokyo
* Survive
* Stratego
* Blokus

Also don't forget to give them a dose of the classics. Chess, backgammon, Othello, Set, 9 men's Morris, mancala are all easy to learn but hard to master.

My ~5 year old enjoys My First Carcassone a lot. Maybe give that a try?
I would suggest **My First Carcassonne**. My 4 and 6 year olds really like it. It's still a tile laying game but much simpler. All tiles can be joined anyway. You are trying to complete roads with your colour meeples on them. First to place 7 or 8 (can't remember) wins. Simple. Fun. You can even help or hinder other people depending on how you guys like to play games. It's a good Introduction to Carcassonne. 
**Monster Factory** has a bit more kid friendly theme.

**Qwirkle** is another good all ages game.  
How about [Loony Quest?]( https://youtu.be/K5F4ygkNSxI)
Kingdomino has been a hit with my kids, their cousins, and adults as well.
I would recommend 10 Days in Africa if you can find it.  It is out of print, I think.  You are teaching critical thinking and geography, and it is fun.  It was a mensa select winner, and can be played with kids.  So, if you can find it, that would be my choice.
I've played all 4 games with my 6 year old son. You can't go wrong with any of them. Yes Kids of Carcassonne is very light, but still enjoyable for me. Maybe look at Ticket to Ride First Journey too. Available in USA.
I just started working on a Geeklist for this the other day! https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/217382/mini-meeple-hobby-gaming-5-year-old
Hmmm thinking back we would play a lot of **Kinder Bunnies**, **Labyrinth** (the Ravensburger version) but with the handicaps, **Chicken Cha Cha Cha**, and even **Cave Troll**.  In fact my 6 year-old often beat everyone at Cave Troll, to our frustration.  

These days I'd try some of the Drei Magier games like the **Magic Labyrinth**, and the **Enchanted Tower**.  Another one that's *really* fun for all ages is **Ghost Blitz**.    
I bought **Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers** when mine were pretty young. It works pretty well, especially if the hunters (like farmers) are not used until they get the other aspects down. We still play it from time to time, even though we've had it about three years now and have loads of other games.
Labyrinth is fantastic, can't recommend it enough.
Rules are completely simple enough for youngsters to grasp.
Yes, you did. 

1. You're using other people's money for this. This is taking advantage of them and is wrong.

2. Your girlfriend would evidently break up with you over it. Doesn't this call into question the wisdom of this for you?

3. You don't know if you'll even like it. You've never played the game before and you're prepared to drop $1600 on it?

4. You could get literally 50 other games for this price. Why the fuck are you spending it all on one game when your collection is so small?

5. You won't even be getting it until December of 2020. That's 4 years from now! Do you know how long 4 years is? Who knows what your tastes will be in 4 years. Get something you know you'll like now instead.

All in all, please cancel your pledge and consider talking to someone about this because the fact that you'd even think about making this purchase is a problem.
You did not do anything. You have more then one month to cool down and reconsider :)
Yes
Best plan when you're about to spend a good chunk of money? TEST, REVIEW, and Contemplate

**TEST**- You can buy Tabletop Simulator for about $10 right now on steam, and you can try KD:M there. Try it out yourself, and maybe even buy a copy for your brother and friend(a 4-pack costs $30). The minis in the game aren't super well made, so you'll know if you like the game system, or if you're just wowed by the minis

**Review**- There are a handful of reviews on the web, video, and text about the game. Read them, really listen to what they have problems with, and read the rulebook yourself

**Contemplate**- Really think to yourself, are you going to be playing this 1 year after you get your pledge? what about 2 years? How often will this game to the table? 

In the end, if you're careful with the product, even if you don't like it, you could **probably**(not 100%) sell your copy for *AT LEAST* what you paid for and a little bit more
Don't use your inexperienced friends and family to buy this.  Get the base game and maybe gamblers chest on your own.  You can buy everything discounted next black Friday if you need to.   This is not a good decision. 
For $1666, why not get 30+ other good games? You could get campaign games to scratch the same itch, some miniatures games, some RPGs, some battle games...
I would suggest you to watch many playthrough videos out there, with your brother and best friend, and decide whether you will enjoy the game or not from seeing those videos.

That was what I had done and finally I thought the game is too punishing for my taste. 

In the end of the day, it is your money (and your brother's and your best friend's), so you have to decide.
I think you meant to poat this in r/boardgamescirclejerk
I would cancel the pledge. I buy extremely expensive games and cannot imagine you will get $1,666 dollars worth of enjoyment out of this. 
If you keep your pledge through, then yes, I truly believe you have wasted your money. The only chance you have gotten something valuable from this pledge is that you're a good investor where you are planning to sell this off at a good profit maybe later via ebay. If you have never or rarely buy and sell off something with a profit in your life till now, then I doubt you are doing it that for now.

From your description you are emotionally "excited" by that KS and wishing to get a complete set and not for having fun playing it. For that kind of money you splurge, you can get a lot more fun by buying tons of other games via Amazon, CSI, CH, or MM. You have zero chance of getting that much of fun-ness from that single KS.

And, worst, you're buying something that you believe is of immense value to you (and assume everyone around you will love it as well), but likely your gaming buddies will not think so. And then you feel hurt because you realize they are not with you. Are you going to unfriend them? Basically, you're splurging $1666 to ruin your relationship. Not worth it. Of course, if you're billionaire rich say like Baron, our first family-elect, then yeah, go ahead, might as well pledge a few more set for ALL your friends as well(and me?).

Everyone else here who say you're not are lying or worst...being PC because deep down inside they themselves wished they pledged that, but in reality they can't or unwilling to.
Good for you.

Do what brings you joy.

I'm envious. I'm stuck at the $300 pledge (with a backup $200 pledge in case I panic later) but I've debated a bigger pledge on and off since the campaign began. 
How are we supposed to accurately predict whether or not you will find your $1,666 pledge to be of value? Or predict if you have buyers remorse?
What videos did you show them? I need help justifying my 350$ ha hA
I backed a few video-game kickstarters. These are the general results from such an experience; which fortunately I always backed low <20$ apart from one exception which actually turned out to be the biggest stinker at about 30$.

1. The lower your pledge level the better. Risk should be spread through as MANY pledgers as possible at the lowest cost per pledger imo this is how Crowdfunding should most positively work, for obvious reasons.
2. The higher your pledge level, the calculation you're making is: The higher I pledge the MORE reward I will get that I NEED (alternatively re-sale value for collectors??).
3. I think this is not just additively risky but exponentially RISKY. It's much much easier to over-estimate the UTILITY you will get out of a future purchase than under-estimate it.
4. The risk also is that something else goes wrong with the kickstarter eg delay or else opportunity cost, now or near-now you find some things spreading your investment over would have yielded greater reward cumulatively.
5. Remember your money is TIED-UP during the process of delivering the kickstarter for a fairly long period unlike an instant purchase exchange of goods and money in a regular sale.

Of the kickstarters I backed, almost all delayed. Most were substandard, some were reasonable but the hype had worn off long before I got the game and almost forgotten about it. Barely 1:10 was actually worth it which is not dissimilar to normal. Just because it's on kickstarter and crying out for funds to "make the magic happen!" (good sales-pitch with many thank-yous) makes that harsh reality no different.

I'd say only the purchaser can estimate the value of their purchase to themselves according to how much disposable income they have and what makes them happy. For taking a "regular scenario of regular person backing",

**At that pledge level** the RISK seems almightily high to Reward ratio. I would never back higher than what you can afford without blinking or thinking about to lose.


I started by getting a second hand copy for a good price. I was sure it would not be worth the high cost. Instead to my suprise it was the best game iv ever played. It was just the thing iv always wanted from a game. So i spent a fortune on getting all of the extra expansions etc. Also if i hadnt liked it i could have resold it with(!!) proffit! So if push comes to shove and you dont like it, just sell it.  

I see some people suggest trying it out on tabletop simulator. Do yourself a favor and try to find a real copy to play. The minies and player interaction makes a lot of difference!
I have the game and love it. It is one of the best games I've ever played. I'm biased, the game is incredibly awesome.

From a Skill Level PoV, you're looking at something a little more complex (I don't believe the game mechanics are really that hard) than what you've been playing.  It is a VERY different game from what you've been playing.

Should you go "All In"? That's for you and you're budget to decide.  The quality of the game is certainly worth every penny - you will be hard pressed to find a game with higher quality components. There is a lot of game play w/o even using the expansions.

Miniatures - are you prepared to glue and assemble all of the Monsters & Survivors and the armor kits? Some people are intimidated by this. If you've every built a plastic model kit, this is old hat. If not, then it's certainly another consideration. The models don't need to be painted, they look great plain, but they do beg to be painted.

Watch a couple of Twitch episodes.  I know there are a few groups out there that are posting sessions. I think that would be the best way to see what game play is like.

You don't have to go all in right away.  I've not done the comparison, but see if it's any different to pledge for the game now and be charged when the KS ends. And then when the pledge manager comes around (which could easily be a few months after the KS ends), then choose you're add-ons and be charged for those.  This way you can divide up what you're paying into smaller chunks.

Hope this helps you in coming to a decision.
I just pledged the $750 "Ancient Lantern" level myself after missing out on the original kickstarter, watching a play through video and being totally intrigued, but then getting scared away at the huge reseller prices on the 'net. 

Then I stumbled onto the 1.5 KS and I figure, I could simply resell this for more money (along with ALL of the current expansions) if I don't end up liking the game. 

I have a question myself guys.   I actually didn't KNOW you had to build the pieces yourself.  After the miniatures are built, will I be able to fit the miniatures back into the box or no?  Silly as it sounds, this might actually be the dealbreaker. I live in an NYC apartment, and don't have the room for it if I can't put them all back into the box.  
Well, if you are rich guy, and 1666$ is not a lot for you, then you did not waste them. If you are not that rich, I would probably not invest that much $$ in something I have never played nor do I know will I like it in the end.

Lets face it, just base game is long enough, and you need dedicated group to play it. I don't think that it would be fun, if people keep drooping out after 5-10 sessions each time.
Game is hard, so you will probably repeat it at least once before you beat it.

You can get several expansions, that add so much to replay ability.

Are you miniature collector and painter? Because if you are not, then those pin ups get you nothing.

I bet that most of people who got all expansions last time, didn't even have time to properly play half of them. Since from what I read, game is recommended to play with around 3 expansions, and first time you probably don't want any.

So unless this is only game you will play for years to come and you have dedicated group to play whole campaigns, it's probably not worth it to go all in, especially if you are not sure right now.

Also, look at some negative reviews and flaws that people think about the game. Do you have problem with a loot of book keeping? Do you mind, oh, you roll 1, you are dead, period. Start with new guy, because guy you put all that hard work in, just had a bad roll after defeating epic monster on the way home.

I've cut down from four to three games this month and given each one a little more attention. Hope folks enjoy!
Congrats on the column, very cool to see this kind of exposure in such a well known publication. 
I've been *loving* Hand of the King. It definitely plays best at 2p, though, which basically makes it a chesslike head to head abstract strategy game.
Not to be confused with an instagram/Facebook dedicated to board games ... @boardgamehoard
"Regular roundup of the best new tabletop titles",

might want to change your title a bit when you pick such titles as a game of thrones: hand of the king and HMS dolores. 

I get that with the guardian you have an audience that needs a bit friendlier games but your pick of titles here is very sketchy and calling them the best is downright silly. 

It's always good to see exposure in such a well known medium though and the writeups are nice. I just wonder why you chose these titles, there seem to be so much better options available, even if you want to appeal to a more mainstream audience, not sure exactly what frame of reference you have for 'release this month', i suppose widespread release in US stores?, but surely you review some better titles than these if you go for the best. 

I mean captain sonar isn't really new either, why not cover titles like Inis, terraforming mars, imhotep, harry potter hogwarts battle, mechs v minions, codenames:pictures, the networks etc. 

I get you have to make a selection and can't mention all games but outside of captain sonar you've got some quirky choices here. 
So everyone wins when Taylor gets eaten?
This is my friend Alex's game! She's aces, so, if you love Gilmore Girls and party games, please buy as many copies as Kirk has jobs.
You just found the perfect Christmas present for someone on my list!!!
Can you describe the game a bit? How close is it to One Night Ultimate Werewolf (if you have played that).
Wait--this is actually amazing! Is there a Kirk character card???
Very cool. How long does a round usually last?
I played this game with them. It is AWESOME and weird, and the artwork is fantastic .
I love both Werewolves of Millers Hollow and Gilmore Girls so this looks perfect for me.
This looks amazing! Is it playable with 4/5 people?
I played this with my family over the holiday, and it is awesome!! The game is different every time because there are many optional character cards with different special abilities, so the moderator can customize the game.
Yeah, I feel like the Black Box idea could have been really great and could have really been something people look forward to every year, but they ran it into the ground. 

The fact that they don't toss in a Love Letter retheme shows they don't really know what they are doing. Put in an exclusive Guildhall themed deck or whatever product you want to sling and then something else (maybe a few things) and call it a day.

Apparently, you're getting a single new game called Phase.
I think if i got the 2015 box at full price I would feel ripped off. However I got it pretty cheap and I think it's decent. 
There was a video tutorial/review that came out:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5oQlOAuozg
As a person who plays a lot at a magic shop, the game in this year's Black Box, Phase, is amazing. It is just enough magic while still maintaining board game feel, that i can con the others into playing with me.
ps, also willing to play Space Alert, Robinson Crusoe, Earth Reborn, Level Seven: Omega Protocol, Tide of Iron,...just more games that I have and haven't necessarily played recently if at all. Thanks!
> old-school PnP RPG guy

Print and Play RPG? Like what have you printed and played? I'm PST and haven't played much but I backed 1.5 as well..
In Europe but well up for playing any and all of those games at some stage. Steam name is the same as my reddit name. 
This sounds awesome. I am in Europe however is that's not a problem PM me 
how much is KDM on tabletopsim? is it a good way to play it before i get my hard copy? also how does it play? good? clunky?
I'm from EU with free time. Anyone PM me for some KDM :)
I'd be interested, I just downloaded TTS on Steam 
[
http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsJustPhil/](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsJustPhil/)
you find a good mod for it? The ones I am trying keep failing to load certain assets from websites and end up with unload parts falling through the board over and over.
Also willing to play in US CST.  I own the game as well so I am familiar with it.  I tried adding your name, no dice.  M1A1 Pusstracks is my name
Already got a couple groups with varying levels of success but at the very least I could help you guys get the TTS setup going if you'd like. PM me if interested.
I would also be interested but joining as an spectator (is that even possible?). Want to learn the rules, turn sequence, AI resolution, etc. to play solo at first.
Basically anything from level 99 games: BattleCON, Millennium Blade, Pixel Tactics, etc. 
Top two would be Argent or Tragedy Looper.
**Tanto Cuore** is a Dominion style deckbuilder where you're hiring anime girl maids.

**Heart of Crown** is a semi Ascension style deckbuilder where you're building a kingdom for anime princesses.

**Fairy Tale** is a card drafting game with fantasy theme in anime art.

**Shadow Hunters** is a social deduction game in the style of anime characters.

There's also those **Attack on Titan** deckbuilding game and the **Naruto** boardgame which are specifically anime related.

There's also **Code of Nine** which is done by the same guy who did **Tragedy Looper**. 
Ravens of Thri Sahashri - Interesting asymmetric coop card game

Kanzume Goddess - Dueling-style of deckbuilder

God's Gambit - UNO-style card game

Sakura Arms - Another interesting dueling card game

My recommendation would be Millennium Blades, for two reasons, the first is that its a great game the second is that the mechanics tie into and re-enforce the theme. While stuff like Barbaross/Tanto Cuore/Dynamite Nurse/Heart of Crown/etc. all have solid mechanics the mechanics dont really tie into the theme. Whereas with Millennium Blades the mechanics are inextricably intertwined with the theme. 

My backup recommendation would be Tragedy Looper, the mechanics here generate the same kind of stories as the visual novel the game is inspired by (admittedly in somewhat more abstract terms)
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43022/yomi
There is the Space Dandy board game, a pretty decent deckbuilder... It needed more playtesting though :(
**Tanto Cuore** is a deckbuilder about hiring anime maids. Despite the lurid theme, it's mechanically solid.
**Ars Alchemia**
**Anima**
Papa Bless that deal
I got kingdom death expansions at 50% off :)
Arkham Horror The Card Game for 33 bucks. Quite happy to find it in stock at the LFGS and at a pretty good price. 
I picked up Zombicide Black Plague for $46 and got free shipping. I was pretty pleased. I found the Paul Bonner Guest Artist character set for $17 as well.
Vinhos Deluxe, Great Western Trail, and Colony for $137 (B2G1 at the local shop). Got home, opened everything up, and Vinhos turned out to be a KS edition with all the extras ($115 on CSI). According to the shop, they somehow don't always know if they get KS or retail copies from their distributor. Score!

Also pulled the trigger on the KDM Kickstarter. Was able to drop down into an early bird level when he opened a few more slots tonight. 
Scythe and Seafall for 120 or so and tax. Know I could've got them cheaper, but no postage and paid for with store credit.
I wish I had a LGS that did a bogo.  I got Pademic Legacy for $31.08 shipped.
Nabbed Kingdom Builder for $5 with the Amazon deal + Discover card shopwithpoints promo 
Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization from Amazon for $55
Nothing yet cause not enough deals on Amazon for me to clock over USD125 in purchases so I can qualify for free shipping to Singapore. Bummer!
I have gotten so far:  
Arkham Horror (Amazon)  
Small World (Target)  
Codenames (Target)  
Dead of Winter (Barnes and Noble)  
Mage Knight (Amazon not BF just had some left over giftcards)

About $120 total. 
Told myself I wouldn't buy anything this weekend, but couldn't resist **Fresco** on Amazon for $27 and change.
Ha! I was just about to create this exact same thread.

I picked up **Fury of Dracula** and **Mysterium** from Barnes and Noble for $64 using their BOGO 50%-off stacked with a 30% off coupon.



Also, tempted to use the Jet.com 30%-coupon to snag **Lords of Waterdeep** and **Scoundrels of Skullport** for $45, but haven't taken the plunge just yet.

**Update**: Well, looks like I snozed and lost, because the Jet coupon is dead.
Kingdom death 1.5 Black Friday gold pledge
2 kingdom death bosses (spider and slender)

All army expansions (minus monsters) for battlelore

The last 8 second summoner decks for summoner wars

2 expansions for ashes

Blood borne card game
 
Black fleet

Kemet

Survive: escape Atlantis + 5-6 player expansion

Coup: g54

Lost legacy: gardens + vorpal sword

And hopefully masmorra  and space base mutiny will come in when I get some of this stuff shipped in (but that's doubtful).
Snagged the Amazon lightning deal for the **Netrunner** core set. Finally.

I've been interested in playing Netrunner for  s o   l o n g ... but the sheer number of expansions and data packs and the need for dedicated person(s) to play with kept me away. Now with the announcement of the *Terminal Directive* expansion, my wife is actually pretty eager to play with me! So the core set should keep us busy until we've wrapped our heads around the mechanics and different factions, and by then *Terminal Directive* should be out. By the time we've finished the campaign and gotten used to the new cards, we'll have a solid idea of which 1-2 more expansions and 3-5 data packs to buy.

And then they'll reboot with a new edition, lol.
I missed a chance to get the Codex core set for $35 CAD by being undecided about what else to get. When I woke up in the morning it was out of stock :/
I got expansions for Elder Sign and Hostage Negotiator from Cardhaus. 
I'm in Southern Europe, our Black Friday Deals are not as good as in the US, but my FGLS has a 25% discount on everything (they usually sell games at the same price as Amazon.es). I just ordered Dead of Winter: The Long Night and I'm still torn between getting another game on top of that.
Tyrants of the Underdark for $40 on CSI. I've heard good things about the game, it seemed interesting, but there was just no way I could justify a $80 price tag.
I got the base **Imperial Assault** for 55 from Coolstuffinc with free shipping for some reason despite not going over $100. This is good because I have all but Bespin Gambit and I have a lot of the villain and ally packs. Got them first because they were on deep sales earlier and I had some time to paint some minis while I waited for a good deal on the base game. 

I might actually get to play the game this year!
 I backed the Kingdom Death: Monster kickstarter at the 200$ Black Friday pledge. I'm really itching to try that one out.
[deleted]
Codenames from Target for 10 dollarydoos. 
At my local gamestore picked up cosmic encounter and quadropolis for $50. They were having half off a bunch of games. They had quite a few games but it was cramped in the store with all those people.

Oh and Android netrunner on amazon for 19.97
Vinhos Limited Reserve signed by the designer for 200$
I got Arkham Horror for $36 and Smash Up with two expansions for $42 at my local game shop. Maybe I could have gotten better deals elsewhere, but I was glad to finally be able to support them while buying boardgames! They had everything 40% off, so some games even matched the cheapness of Amazon. Hooray! 
I got Mysterium, Carcassonne, and Smallworld from Barnes and Noble for under $85 with some creative checkout and coupon use.

Sheriff of Nottingham for $18 from Walmart.com

Dominion for $18 from Half Price Books. It was brand new in box but sold as if used.

Machi Karu for $15 from Target, I think.

Coup for $7 for a White Elephant Christmas Thing.

A couple others that I can't remember. Overall I think I did pretty well. 

(I am new to the hobby and needed some of the classic ones, so most of these deals wouldn't be for the more experienced players who already own them)

Edit: Also Flash Sale on Amazon for Arkham Horror and the Game of Thrones Board Game, $33 & $38 respectively Wasn't too great of a deal but it was a little better than I have seen them anywhere.
Just went to the local shop, no amazing deals since all the was on sale was Catan and expansions unfortunately. Looked at Viticulture and Scythe and they were cheaper than Amazon prices, but still out of my range for now, especially with wanting to back Kingdom Death. Considered the latest Tokaido expansion, but just went for a base copy of Valley of the Kings instead.
Fury of Dracula, Marvel Legendary: Dark City, 2x Game of Thrones LCG core box, a playmat, and a bunch of sleeves for about $150
Codenames $7 amazon
Big Book of Madnesss + Epic Spell Wars $45 Barnes and noble
Hanabi, Agricola, and Cyclades at 30% off. Was planning to buy some games soon anyways so black Friday was a nice coincidence. 
Android Netrunner $20 Amazon.

Looking for a good deal on Legendary Encounters Aliens.
ANR Core for $20

Looks like meat(space) is back on the menu!
For Kingdom Death, I got the Lonely Tree expansion for 50% off (the only expansion I don't own), and pledged for the Black Friday Gambler's Lantern pledge level (which is basically the 1.5 upgrade pack, Gambler's Chest, and ALL the new expansions/promos added as part of the campaign).  

On Amazon I snagged Android: Netrunner for $20 and Monopoly Deal for $6 as part of lightning deals.
I preordered Arkham Horror LCG and Shadowrift at no discount! 
Got My KDM Pledge in, Roll for the Galaxy, Arkham Horror LCG, and Codenames!
**Castles of Burgundy** for $20 shipped for the wife and me. 

**Pandemic Legacy** for ~$32 shipped as a gift for a buddy of mine (and you'd better believe I'm going to play it with him!).
after an amazon coupon, i got **las vegas** and **order of the gilded compass** for $13 combined. :)
Jealous as fuck of that deal, man.
I'm not sure how badly your boxes got damaged, but when my corners split I use a single strip of masking tape on the outside and the inside of the box. Seems to do the trick. 
I'm going to assume you mean corners got ripped.  I've repaired many boxes that have been ripped up and had them looking almost new.  What I do is use wood glue, pour a blob onto some cardboard or thick paper, then apply it to the ripped area using a Q-tip, being careful not to get any on the outside or  graphic portion on the box.  Push together, folding the outsides onto each other and then hold them together with a bit of tape.   Give it a couple hours (or 45min if you are using the fast setting stuff) then remove the tape.  Finally, I re-enforce the corner by cutting a square from a thick piece of paper, folding it to fit inside the corner, and gluing that into place.

Don't leave tape on the box.  Leave it for too long and you won't be able to get it off without ripping up the box.  

There is a YouTube video of a guy doing this somewhere, I'll try and find it after I get coffee going.
There's a whole thread (geek list maybe) on BGG about repair tips and techniques for all sorts of damage done to games.  On mobile now and can't link but you could probably Google it up. 
As alternative, I think it was Dice Tower that reviewed a travel bag where they encouraged putting game components in Ziploc bags. Their claim was that boxes are mostly empty space anyway.
Probably helps to give more context. The Coal Chute on its own says nothing about you automatically winning when you put a token on it. 
Not sure what haunt you are talking about but since you are bringing it up. In haunt 86 if the coal chute is a ground floor room do you still fall to the basement if you succeed the might roll and flip the room tile?

I can think of 2 possible games:


Superfight: Where you take cards and argue why your creature would win. (ex. Hawking with a laser or T-Rex with a chainsaw)


Drunk, Stoned, or Stupid: Slightly similar to CAH but not really, a person gets a topic and you guys argue who it applies more to. (ex. Who deserves the 'acts the most immature' card).


I really enjoy Drunk, Stoned, or Stupid, but both are quite fun party games though! :)
Edit: Also, a couple of other games I enjoy for large parties are One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Bang.
Check out Snake Oil! It's a card game where you get to argue why the active player should buy your wacky product and then awards points in a similar way as Cards Against Humanity. 
[Metagame](http://metaga.me/)?
Apples to Apples is basically the boring vanilla version of Cards Against Humanity

Is this the on you were thinking of http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/1a2d/ 
If you're arguing over which character would win in a fight, that's **Superfight**.
Is it This one http://www.personallyincorrect.com/
https://www.agameforgoodchristians.com/
I had a brilliant time last year playing **Monikers** with my family. We played with twelve and I'm sure it would go higher.
Also, with that description, I recommend **Stipulations**. Check it out. 
What about the politics game from Justin Robert Young? The Contender? That's more about political debates though.
One night ultimate werewolf
If you have a smaller group and want a little more theme but keep the arguing/bargaining then try **Sheriff of Nottingham**.

Each turn, one player is the Sheriff allowing/denying merchants' shipments to reach market. He or she can take bribes, confiscate goods and make deals. 
**Cards Against Humanity** represents the pinnacle of family gaming... if you can't have fun playing CAH with grandma maybe try just playing solitaire?

Not all families are true gamers.
If you have the beginner game already, then pretty much the only thing you *need* is the core rulebook. 

After a while, extra dice will come in handy, since dice pools can get a bit crazy in later play, personally I bought three sets total (including the beginner game set) and that is about right for my group's level of play (it's been a long campaign). 

If you want to run a game, the published adventures are quite good, but there's a lot of great quality free stuff and you can always create your own. 

If you're a player, you might want to check out the relevant book for your career for more options, but again, it's not necessary. 

I also personally use a small whiteboard to sketch out encounter maps where necessary, just so people have a clear idea of what's where. Minis too are nice, but not necessary. You can use chits, poker chips, printed standees or even just mark positions right on the map - combat in EotE is much more abstracted. 

I have the screen, but I just lay it flat as a reference since I don't like to use a screen when I GM. The adventure that comes with it is fairly good though. 

As a GM I also have the Star Words app on my tablet for doing the opening crawl for each session, which my players seem to like. 

Apart from that, paper and pencil is pretty much all you need!
You may get more help at r/rpg but I'm pretty sure you just need the Core Rulebook and an Adventure Module (Ex. Beyond The Rim). Maybe a Game Master Kit if you want a screen full of stats. 

Did you play through the Beginner Game already? There's a rule summary and beginner scenario you can run through in there. 
Edge of the Empire details smugglers and Han solo or Boba fett type of characters. If you want a campaign more focused on the rebellion then you have age of rebellion core book. If people want to be jedi focused then you have the force and destiny core book. Each book can be used independently and you can have the whole gamut of a party with only one, but you can mix and match from each book (though that would get expensive) with the one exception being if you want to be an advanced force user with a lightsaber, then the other two books would have additional xp provided to even out the group.you can make force and destiny characters as powered down as the other groups at the start (ie  no lightsaber, but some simple force powers). If you want a smuggler/wrong side of the law book then edge of Empire is all you need to have 
If you've got the beginner game, then nothing. After you've played through that then you only 'need' the Core rulebook. A 2nd set of dice would be handy. And if the GM is inexperienced, they may want to consider one of the pre-made adventure books.

Do what I did. Go to wherever people buy/play magic the gathering (your FLGS).

Talk to random people about board games and ask if there is a local group. 

Find out there is no local group but now you've met a couple local gamers.

Go home and wonder how to put a group together. 

Get evacuated from the biggest wildfire disaster in Canadian history.

Come back home and resume pondering about how to get some boardgames on the go.

Say "fuck it" and create the boardgame group yourself on Facebook.

Go tell people at the FLGS that there is a boardgame group for your local area now.

Watch Wayne's world 2 or Field of dreams and chant " If you build it they will come"

When they come (and they will) get a game night on the go and feel fucking incredible at the community you just gathered.
>So, meetups are at someones house (which I'd rather not go to just in case I don't like the people and not want to stay - has happened before)

No different than a bad blind date, just have a friend call you 45 minutes in, either stay or 'leave for an emergency' at that point

Sorry to hear about your predicament... the two suggestions that come to mind are 

1) starting up your own boardgame night, converting any friends you have into gamers slowly by starting with party games and family games

2) get into [solo boardgaming](https://boardgamegeek.com/guild/1303).

3) boardgamearena.com has quite a few boardgames you can play online...not the same as the real thing but it does help in a pinch.

What games are the big hits these days?  Well, too many to just list, but here are several resources:

Edit: simplified explanation of Dice Tower videos.
Perhaps start your own meetup at a public place? If you like those who show up- go from there.
Are you open to solo gaming? There are some really great games out there that are designed to be played by one person and you can play practically any co-op board game solo.
Yea I'd say give meetup another shot, find public place ones or it is easy to make an excuse to sneak out (pretend to get a text and just say "Oh its my kid, sorry I have to go").

I joined a random few guys on a meetup at a house and they turned into the best consistent group I have played in. Probably played hundreds of games with these guys by now.
Hey!  I had a very similar issue about a year ago.  I was new to boardgaming and reconnected with an old friend.  We ended up starting our own group, but went through many different options before we found what worked out best for us.

* First thing I did was sign up on meetup.com.  This was before reconnecting with my old friend.  I tried it out, was not to my liking.  Way too many people crammed into a small space(once at a small bar and once at someones house).

* My next option was going to local subreddits(in my case r/Michigan and city specific ones nearby).  Through this I found a group that met at a bar.  They now meet at a LGS with a bar inside weekly.  Awesome group, highly recommended.  If you're in southern michigan, PM me and I'll pass their info along.  Unfortunately for me, they're roughly 90 minutes away.  So, I go every couple of months or so

* I used my FLGS group finder/forums.  Found a few people, we met at the LGS a few times.  Still a 45 minute drive for me.  Tho we did add another member here to the final product who had a similar drive

* Last place I went was the BGG forums, and looked in the area specific forums.  Here I met the final person in my group.  We chatted a bit via text and agreed to meet at a neutral place(local coffee house) and play a quick game.  Met, all was good and we got along well.  We formed a group and now rotate between everyone's houses for game day.  Our group is 4-6 people depending on who comes and it works really well for us. 

In the end, I had to look multiple places.  But I also found a fantastic group of friends to game with.  Don't get discouraged, keep on looking.    
Really been digging Inis lately. Max of 4 players. Has ZERO points involved. There are three different possible winning conditions and the first to meet one and hold off the competition for the rest of the round is the winner. Winning is all about out maneuvering and taking the cards for actions or to prevent actions to get you to victory.
Many cooperative games like **Pandemic**, **Forbidden Island**, and **Marvel Legendary** have clear win/lose conditions.

Also a lot of two player games will have clearer winners and losers without the need to do point things - so **Netrunner** and **Battlelore** come to mind, both of which involve players trying to reach a certain target first.

The same goes for several hidden movement games, which usually end when you catch the hidden player. For example, **Fury of Dracula** and **Letters from Whitechapel** both can have really exciting endings.
**Argent: the Consortium** ends epically. It's essentially a dash to see who gets the most votes from secret voters depending on cards you've obtained throughout the game. The game itself is a bit complex but it's a great one. I highly recommend it.
Most social deduction games fit this description of having large, triumphant endings with lots of emotion. **The Resistance: Avalon**, for example.
In **Cyclades** it is fairly easy to see who's on the verge of winning. You win when you have 2 polis and it is easy to discern who's going to bid for a certain god or buy a certain mythic creature to get a winning condition.

It is a dudes-on-a-map game but you also do bids for god's favors at the start of each round. The game is really the bidding and the dudes on the map its just sort of there. Having said that, its a good game that my group enjoys a lot.
If you don't want point counting but don't mind an uncertain goal, I highly recommend Sierra Madre Games *Pax* series.

**Pax Porfiriana** - The first small box card game in the series that was based off of *Lords of the Sierra Madre&.  You are a wealthy businessman during the reign of the Mexican president Porfirio Díaz (1876-1911) and hungry for a change.   Add you build up assets and gain allies, decide where you want the country to go: do you build up loyalty to the current regime, get the US to intervene, attempt to manipulate the system to become president, or start a communist revolution (4 cogent type cards come out during the game, one for each type of victory - if you have enough support in that type of revolution).

**Pax Pamir** - You are a minor tribe in the region note known as Afghanistan during the "Great Game", a time when the British and Russian empires were fighting for control of the region.  Choose your loyalty to one of the great powers or the nationalist movement and try to win politically, with an intelligence war, economically, or in a hot war - but be careful, because the victor rewards only the most loyal of the tribes, so a cunning opponent may undo your hard work by curing favor from the greater power.  Khyber Knives adds new mechanics and events.

**Pax Renaissance** - You are a renaissance banker seeking to manipulate the tapestry of rulership (political or religious) to gain concessions and accumulate wealth.   Build up allies in western and eastern Europe as you work towards one of four major victory conditions: support existing empires and have the most favor with monarchies, throw in with the new republics and their rule by the people, support the dominant religion, or gain the most concessions to control trade in a growing globalized world.  Manipulate the peasants into revolt, arrange marriages and this coronation to gain favor with kinds, maneuver pirates and knights, build forts, find jihads and crusades, fund conquests for kings to vassalize neighbors, watch for comets that open up victory conditions, use bishops to silence the powers of opponents, start great trade fairs, and keep a wary eye on permanently shifting trade routes.  (If you like *Here I Stand* but don't have time to play it, this is a game to check out.)  An expansion adds many new cards and a new card type.

All 3 are great.   *Pax Pamir* is probably the best in terms of smoothness of play and clearest card layout (and surprisingly can play easily in an hour), *Pax Renaissance* was just releases and has taken *Pamir*'s mechanics to the next level,  and *Pax Porfiriana* was the first in the series and is truly mapless. All are essentially tableau card games that come with a large deck of which you use a small subset. Like must Phil Eklund games, negotiations between players is encouraged (but as a player who isn't a huge fan of this, I find that they work well without all the wheeling and dealing).  Rule books are usually hard to get through because Phil prefers to use thematic over clear game play terms and because he believes in splitting rules between the main text and the glossary.  None of these are VP games, but you do have to manipulate the game state towards the type of victory you want (and you might never be able to do that successfully).  They are meaty games packed efficiently into a *The Grizzled* sized boxes.   My favorite is probably *Pax Renaissance* due to the variety in play (I like that you can go on wars of conquest, or ignore it and focus on trade or religion instead), but all present interesting twist on how revolutions come about and none of them have you playing the clichéd role of a great power that pushes everyone around - you're almost always a little guy in the shadow manipulations events while trying to avoid getting steeped on by giants.
Wiz-War has that glorious feeling of victory - you either kill all the other wizards, or be the first to steal 2 treasures and get them to your home base.

Maybe a race to the finish kind of game? Like Formula D, Hare and Tortoise, and Mississippi Queen.

Or a race to be the first to complete a goal, like Can't Stop, 10 Days in the USA, or Niagara.
I wish I had some more games that ended like this myself. This is one thing Catan nails really well - most games, you're never exactly sure when the game is going to end. A few hidden victory points really adds nice suspense. 

I disagree about Lewis & Clark though. If you're pretty far behind, looking at that race track can be really demoralizing. 
**Euphoria** is a worker placement game that's the race to place all 10 of your stars on the board. Beautiful components, and several unique mechanics in a medium-light worker placement game.

**Alien Frontiers** is a sci-fi dice placement game that's a race to 10 points. The points are all public, so the end can get very cut throat. Suffers from potential Munchkin-effect. Medium-light strategy game.

**Chaos in the Old World** is a bloody, asymmetric "dudes on a map" game where each faction can win by advancing it's dial in unique ways or through points awarded each round. Each faction feels very different. Not all possible player numbers are recommended as certain faction combinations are imbalanced. Medium-weight.

**Carcassonne** is the prototypical classic gateway tile-laying game. Very simple, light strategy, continuous scoring, game ends when you run out of tiles.

**Coup** Last. One. Standing. Simple role-deception game. Great filler game.

**Formula D** racing game. It's obviously obvious who's winning because they're in front. Very light, cool dice chucking game.
**Powergrid**
When you light op the most houses it's glorious!
Powergrid has a very clear ending.
**Game of Thrones the Board Game** has a clear ending and it is based on board positioning and strategic area control. It is even clearly marked on a track. The buildup in the first half so you can carry out strategies (and ruin others/have yours ruined) in the second half makes for an epic ending everytime as people begin to throw their bid behind one of 2-3 players who are very close to an ending (usually 1-4 of the players are not setup for a winning move in the last round but I have played 2 games where 4 people were within capturing one stronghold to win in the last round). Suddenly the people who may not win aren't out of the game but are important and contribute to the end game as well. Haven't played a game where there was pile on the leader because of the intrigue and betrayal up to that point causes factions so the whole group never bands together to dethrone one player to let another player run away with it. 

I love this game so I'm going to stop blabbering now. 
If you want coop games with some good stories to tell about that one time you were THIS close, or how you managed to pull off a narrow win I would say ***Eldritch Horror*** Granted the game works best with the expacs so keep that in mind.

We still talk about certain games of that, and its older brother ***Arkham Horror***. Like "Hey remember when you got the photographer and sat in the Silver Twilight Lodge all game and shaped the game for us? or "Remember when we got 3 promises of power to flip on the same turn letting us come back from a sure loss?"
A simple game, but **Machi Koro** is a light game that fits this. You have four landmarks that you need to build, with escalating costs, and you can only build one landmark per turn. From there, it's a matter of watching players build up their money stores and blow the money on a landmark, again and again.
Some of the most intense victories for me have been from real-time dexterity games like **Fuse** or **Escape**. Many times, it comes down to seconds on the clock and my heart literally races as we're trying to finish the last objectives. 
Munchkin!
Allow me to pass this tip forward.

 [This bag, ](https://www.amazon.com/ChromaCast-CC-CBAG-L-Padded-Handle-Shoulder/dp/B00IRMHGQ4/ref=pd_nav_hcs_bia_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=0Y8B07YSP18BJTF40VXC) while designed for a large square musical instrument is basically designed perfectly for anyone wanting to carry a number of board games. It has shoulder straps that are perfect, and unzipping the front panel to reveal all the games inside is too cool.

$0.99 bags from Ikea. They hold 4-6 standard size games easily.

gym bag can hold most games but nothing with big boxes
I don't yet have one of these, but saved it after a similar conversation some months back.  $25 on Amazon and looks pretty sturdy and sizable - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036ZX8KA/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=FHMV2SSO230F&coliid=I557HHAZBETBD&psc=1

Go to your local Walmart, find their luggage section. Look for a duffle bag by the brand Orben. It will run you maybe ~$20 can hold 8 regular game boxes and some smaller ones tucked in and they don't jostle around if you aren't reckless. Stuff some clothes in with the bag and it works even better. It has wheels, one of those little extend-y arms, and it's a bag you can also use for traveling without board games and look completely normal. Orben bags, best luggage purchase I've made since I moved out of my parents place.

Can someone explain to me the draw of this game? Is it just the artwork/story/miniatures, or is the actual gameplay good? My exposure to KD:M is basically through various reddit posts, its official website and this KickStarter. In pretty much all of that there is barely any mention of gameplay mechanics. I contrast this to something like Gloomhaven where there are just standees for monsters but fun new mechanics like card-based combat, legacy elements, etc. It's just very strange to me that this game is so popular yet nobody ever talks about what it actually *is* other than a crapton of detailed miniatures.

I should note I've not actively gone looking for more information. I realize I could probably find a runthrough somewhere. That's not really the point. I'm more interested in why everyone else thinks its good.
I do some rating statistical analysis and the average for this game is incredibly high with quite a small standard deviation.

I can't help but wonder how much being incredibly heavily vested in the game influences people's ratings.
If I was a single man I would back this, but there is zero chance I can explain this to my wife and sound justified. 
So wait, this is not the core game until $200 pledge?
I got into the satan pledge. RIP $$$. 
They bumped the tier numbers from 1,000 to 1,500 it looks like.
Saw $200 for the base game.
Retreated to the corner to cry many tears.
What is the Gambler's Chest and is it worth the extra $100?  Looks like they rolled Philosophy of Death.  Is that the only one or will more be added to Gambler's Chest?
3 million holy shit... Dude was freaking out before he went to bed (that first update...), so can't imagine how he's going to feel soon 😁
As of right now 247 people have pledged for the $1666 level. You guys are insane. You could fill a closet with great, top tier games for that much.
God help me.
For someone living in Brazil, this is impossible for me D:
Just broke 1mil in 20 min...that's insane.
Must.Resist.Spending.Money.I.Don't.Have.
Say what you will but better this making 3 million than Bears and Babies or whatever...
The Black Friday Lantern is already sold out. Is there a rush to order if I just want to buy the core game? It's $250 right now. Will that change or can I wait a month?
I'm loving the pinup males. About time we get these.
"Don't let your dreams be dreams."
Is the ship date really 2020?
No real reason to back now, all the limited tiers are gone except for upgrade.  Might as well wait the 45 days and see where it lands.
This is a great game. BUT! It's not for me. The only thing this game has going for it is that it is huge. Game mechanisms themselves are not unique and different and are, at times, even bloated. I actually think that the combat system is too long for what it is.

If anyone looks for a game that gives a similar feel to this game in terms of punishing rogue-like survival gameplay, but does not have miniatures, take a look at **Assault on Doomrock**. It may also be difficult to find by now, though it's still available in Europe.

I absolutely love Doomrock and though it doesn't have a campaign system, every time it's on table has been a tense cooperative thriller.
Not a chance
I can thankfully say I am virtually unable to buy into KD - even if I wanted to spend everything I had.


Wait. Shit.
Tfw Satan's Lantern
Sorry if this has been asked already - the link mentions Black Friday.. does it mean that prices they're asking for will increase?
Does the $1666 tier include *all* the existing content?

Also, how does this play with 2?
Wasn't going to back it but got the 200 dollar core set.

Figure there's at least "2 nights in the pub" worth of entertainment in the box & if I ever get bored of it, I can sell it for 5 times what I paid. 
I can't believe I bought this just now. Thanks a lot /u/GetThereThenRest lol
Welp, I just backed the base  game blind simply because of the amount of insanity I'm seeing about this reprint.  I assume that, worst case, I can sell it later and get my money back.

My question is in regards to expansions.  How likely is it that I will be able to buy them after the fact if I decide I want them?  Debating on whether or not to just pull the trigger on the full $750 for all of the new expansions rather than the $350 I've already spent for the base game.
Does anyone know how reasonable it would be to pick up the expansions in the future? I could justify $250 up front for the core game, but not $750 for everything. If I could get the expansions over time though, then that'd be much more reasonable.
I notice the expansions are half-priced on their official website as of this moment. I just pledged the core game for their Kickstarter. Should I buy any of the expansion sets? If so, which one?
This game will now climb well onto bgg top 100 and do even better than it has before. I am excited to see how this continues. Go Poots!
Can you only get the old expansions through the ancient lantern pledge you think? i can't tell if there is a way to add them on without picking that one
Getting close to breaking 1mil in under 20 mins
my god these minis are insane.  So tempted
Honest question.

Does anyone consider it to be worth it even without the minis? As in they would be willing to purchase this if it had no minis.

I am almost considering going all in just for the minis and reselling it to someone who just wants the pure game no minis. Maybe they can print out something for stand ins. 

If so what would people value the highest pledge at with no minis. (Satan's Lantern)

So I pledged for Black Friday Gambler's Lantern 2nd Face so I know I am covered for all the new expansions. I also got all the other available expansions on their website. I wonder if you can get single items of the previous expansions added during PM?
**Question:** will the "All 12 Current Expansions (Dragon King, Flower Knight, Etc...)" listed in *Ancient Gold Lantern* pledge levels still be widely available in the future?

I don't necessarily want to buy them all now, but I will very probably want to buy them all at some point without paying (even more) through the nose. 
Can I just have a standee version for $100? I don't do minis. Sounds like such a cool game :(
Successfully funded in literally under 4 minutes. I'll have to check the official data, wherever that is. 

Insane. Already at $750,000 and it's only been live for 15 minutes.
Can someone explain the gamblers chest for me?
Pardon my ignorance, but the original version never received a retail version, correct? I'm considering backing, but I'm trying to reason out the best tier to support if this will be my only shot at getting expansions.
Got in for Black Friday Gold Latern, but I don't know if I'll keep it. Money is tight, and Gloom Haven is coming early next year anyway
I found out about this game a few months ago, too late to buy even a market copy from their website, and knew immediately upon seeing it that it was something I absolutely needed to own. So excited to get this chance!
I just mentioned this to my wife and what the game's mechanics are like, and that the kickstarter raised $3m. She's glaring at me. I wish I didn't know about this thing..... 
Interesting to see the prices/tiers. So much for the folks hoping it would be $100 again.
Bah... I was trying to save money and this was on my want list.
1st wave expansions are also discounted on the main store, what is more interesting : 

- waiting for them to show up as expansions in the Kickstarter and get them along the KS

- Buy them now discounted and possibly without overseas taxes ? 
Much appreciated -- got in before the desired tier filled up!
anyone know if the black friday ninja mini is part of the promos that will be with the satan tier?
So...I have the 200 black Friday lantern right now.  Depending on what is on the chest later today, I might be abandoning that for the 350 gold lantern.  Is there anything I should be trying to get right now since the kingdom death store has the half off sale that I might not be able to get later? Like the wet nurse is only 37 instead of 75.  Are these sorts of things going to be okay to get later and how well do they fit into the game?
Can someone explain this....

* at 750 it says core, gambler, all current expansions (12)
* at 927 it says core, gambler, expansions/promos/pinups from this kickstarter (currently 2), and a t shirt

Why is it nearly 200 more for a lot less stuff?
This sounds absolutely amazing, but it's way out of my price range. Are there any good write-ups of campaigns people have run? I'd like to experience it vicariously.
Does anyone know how long we will have opportunities to purchase this game? It's high up on my wishlist, but my wife and I won't be in a place financially to drop $250 on a game until probably 2+ years from now.
Open spots in Black Friday Gold Lantern, opened it up to 2000 backers.
Ok, just backed this at the $350 level after only hearing about this game yesterday... What have I done
As long as my GF doesn't find out, I'm fine:)
The Black Friday Gold Lantern keeps getting opened up while I am asleep and I keep missing the damned thing. I wish there was a way to have an alarm go off when it opened up or something.
I'm thinking about jumping on board this kickstarter but need to know if this is a game that is fun solo.  It's probably the only way I will play this game.
Just sneaked into a black friday lantern pledge for 200. Don't know why but this game appeals to me on a deep level...
My only regret/wish was that there were copies sans miniatures. But that's ok.
Can someone explain the hype for this? I'm not sure I'm understanding 
Looks like a success.  So far:

    7,293 backers
    $3,071,333 pledged of $100,000 goal 
    520 backers at the $1,666 level.

It must be nice to have money.  =)  My only hope is that sometime around the summer of 2021, I will find a copy at a thrift store or garage sale.
$50 off for early bird?!?!?!?!

FUCK

THAT
They're adding more slots to the Black Friday Lantern deals, just a heads up!
Poots just dealt a serious wound to my bank account. Anyone got the wound table to roll on for that?
Fuck that's expensive. And I thought cool mini or not was a lot for $100 for most campaigns.
Welp, better up my painting skills. 
I've already invested in Pandemonium, Deep Madness and Mythic Battles: Pantheon. This would have to have some unique to buy into another miniature based game. What's the appeal of this one?
So if I want to get the most of this kickstarter while spending the least money, what would you guys reccomend? 
Since it looks like the minis get customized based on what happens in the campaign, how does replaying work? Do I just have to pretend he has an axe or whatever even though I rubber cemented a sword in last time? And same thing for the different heads, do I get to just choose that once? Or does it not work like that?
How does this game play solo?
Never thought I would get a chance at this game...


Expansion or no expansions?


All slots for Black Friday are done for...


Also I don't know what the Gambler chest would unveil.... I see stretch goals were blown though already... but 927 $.... maybe the 350$ and the ks exclusive expansions, but I don't know which will those be.
Definitely going to back the base and possibly the gamblers upgrade. But although expansions would be cool i reeeaaallly dont know how to justify over $1200 on expansions alone, when that money could buy like 10 absolutely awesome games instead.
This looks amazing...

Just for clarity: what is the 'minimum' pledge level to get the entire game? This looks awesome so I'm interested but I'd want everything: base game and expansions.
Unfortunately, I had to drop out; I'm trying to save up for a Nintendo Switch, and be somewhat financially responsible in the meantime. I have a LOT of games as is. 

It looks super cool, and I'll see about getting in if they ever do a V2, but for now my bank account is emaciated enough.
What is up with that name?

To me it reads like, *United States: Bear*.

Am I missing something? Does it make sense to other people?
And people were complaining that Cthulhu Wars was too expensive...
I am glad that this guys are offering high quality figures and the game seems pretty cool...

I am also glad I cannot afford it at the moment and that waiting until DECEMBER 2020! it would be too much time to wait for it.
This dude needs to go on Shark Tank. He'd easily land a deal and be able to mass produce. 
Those prices.  Over 200 per game even at retail level?
Took me several attempts to get my pledge in; kept getting errors (probably from the insane amount of people hitting this).  The Black Friday pledge level is almost gone.  $1 million in less than 20 minutes.  Crazy.
Got my pledge in, WOO! Good luck to everyone trying to pledge!
OMG.. is the shipping to Singapore really $100? :(
The retail version is just 6x the base Game at the retail price?

I'm puzzled.
Still too bloody expensive
I know it's shipped in waves, but 2020 is a crazy amount of time for this. Makes no sense since he does have most of the molds ready.

Is Poots still being a control freak wanting to do everything himself? He really needs to hire people.

Is that Dec 2020 date real?! Please god no. I don't have that kind of patience.
That expected delivery date.... holy shit. 
This video isn't all that helpful as to how the game plays, but it's pretty entertaining: https://youtu.be/6Jqjss1fCeg
Okay so for someone who hasn't played a tabletop minatures game. which set or should i say which teir should i back up to get a good experience if i plan on buying expansions and what not as i go. I really want to get into something like this just have no clue about what i need to play it. I dont have any sets as well.
$2.5m already. I'll bet that core game gets delayed by 6m+ months once he's completely overwhelmed by the demand to print and send 10 times more games than he expected. And 2020 planned for some parts is crazy, your grandkids will get those.
My god, what have I done...
I have the original. I still haven't played it yet though.

Is there a way to upgrade it to the new ruleset before I play?
Ships in Dec 2020? Is that really how long backers have to wait? Edit: Just read a comment about core game in 2017. Sorry
Waiting 4 years absolutely kills it for me.  I've already waited 4 years on Robotech. 
So last campaign Core game was 100$, but now is 250$?!?!

Can someone explain the December 2020 ship date? Wtf are they sculpting each model by hand?
Estimated delivery dec 2020?? 
Delivery Dec 2020????
Estimated shipping: December 2020
Sounds fun, how much for the base game? $250? Ok, seeya later! 
2020??????
$250 for a game that won't ship until 2020? And it has over 2 million dollars so far. What don't I know about this game? How the hell is it so popular and I've never heard of it? Help?
Again? This was a kickstarter offer last year. 
Estimated delivery Dec 2020.

 4 **YEARS** from now!?!
exactly what I'm looking for!
Looking for a board game to bring to the family over christmas and getting bored of the never ending trivial-pursuit-monopoly sagas. 

Completely new to all these boardgames, really excited to get a couple.
Thanks. This is a great list!
Great job on the list! I'll be using it to grab a few boardgames for friend's kids!
Is it bad that I own all these?
Insanely great list... Trouble is my family already owns most of these...
That's a great list. The only changes I would make is removing Dominion and replacing Forbidden Island with Forbidden Desert. 
Great list; has anyone got any further suggestions for slightly younger kids? 

I have two nephews (10 and 7) who both love board games. The older one is pretty advanced and loves stuff like Forbidden Desert, Carcasonne etc. I'm going to get him Pandemic. The younger one struggles with anything too strategic. Last year I got him Zombie Dice and he loved it, but I'm struggling for ideas this year. 

They've already got King of Tokyo, Tokaido, Tsuro and Labyrinth.
I own both of these games. First of all I think both are excellent, and both are very, very different. 

***Experience of owning/playing***

I think this is the most fundamental difference between them, so I'll start here. **MoM** is a perfectly good standalone game. It has and will continue to have a run of expansions but they'll probably come out every 4-6 months. So the dynamic of the game's scenarios changing will be slower than **AHLCG** which also has a great core set experience, but will have expansions every month, with new packs coming out. This means it's a constantly evolving system. With MoM you'll buy the core game/expansion, play the new scenario(s) and then spend the next few months playing them again and again. With AHLCG you'll do the same, but you'll be getting a new scenario every month. 

The other key difference is that both offer a 'lifestyle' game experience in different ways. AHLCG lends itself to this more naturally, with expansions every month and it being a card game you'll want to play it again and again and it will be quick and easy to do so. You'll have to think about storage, sleeves, binders etc. MoM will be less so, but can offer the hobby aspect of painting all the miniatures, so when you're not playing you can be painting. 

***Price***

Initial outlay is roughly similar, as MoM is a big box game (£65+) and AHLCG is going to be core set (£30) x2 plus sleeves. AHLCG will probably more expensive ultimately because it'll have more content over the years, but will be more affordable at only £11~ per month for each pack and £25~ every 6-8 months for a deluxe expansion. MoM on the other hand will have less frequent expansions but will be far more expensive each time at £40+ and may seem like less value, containing 'only' a few minis, cards and tiles. 

***Replayability*** 

Despite only containing 4 scenarios, I think you can get plenty of playtime from the MoM base game . I think you can play each scenario 3-4 times, explore different player counts and investigators before you'll feel that you've exhausted all the content. Having said that, I think the different investigators, whilst having different stats and abilities don't play massively differently from one another. The expansions contain 1 new scenario. 

AHLCG core set is similar, with 3 scenarios and you can play each one 1-3 times before you've explored all of the main narrative beats and forks in the path. Each investigator plays very differently from each other, therefore giving more replayability. You've got 4 different player counts and difficulty settings to try out too. 

***Campaign vs Standalone***

Ultimately AHLCG feels ***far more*** like an RPG than MoM - because your character (deck) levels up over time and the scenarios are linked together into a campaign. The scope of the scenarios is potentially wider than MoM too, since they can conceivably be set anywhere, whereas MoM by definition is somewhat tied to Mansions.

In MoM each scenario is completely standalone, there is no campaign mode and there's no progression for your investigator. 

***Gameplay Length***

MoM is generally faster and easier to set up but the game itself will take longer. Depending on player count you can crack out a scenario of AHLCG in 20-60 mins. MoM scenarios can go to 4 hours or so. 

***Immersion and Narrative*** 

I think MoM is quite a bit more immersive - you've got the minis, the map tiles, the sound effects, voice acting, 'DM text' from the app etc. And it's less abstracted because of all that too. That's not to say that AHLCG isn't immersive though. I think MoM might have a stronger narrative, too in each scenario, because it has more tools to portray it - but I think the major difference is that in MoM that narrative often just happens 'to you'; in AHLCG you have more agency in shaping the narrative. 

***Gameplay itself***

MoM is much more of an 'experience' game. The game sort of happens to you. You don't have to make agonising decisions - there's not much strategy or tactics happening. AHLCG is far more 'gamey' you'll have to think strategy when making your deck at the start of a campaign and during gameplay your decisions have far more weight and matter more. 

***Game night or gaming buddy?***

Ultimately I think the major difference, as I described at the top is that MoM lends itself far better to the 'game night' - you've got 1-4 friends over that have or haven't played it before, you can crack it out and have fun. You're not worrying about teaching the game, you're not worried about people optimising their play. And you're not having to get them back next week to carry on the campaign. 

AHLCG lends itself to a dedicated gaming partner(s) that jumps in with you. You'll be thumbing through cards, making decks and then taking a crack at a campaign of 3-8 scenarios, presumably over a few weeks/sessions. 

I played both quite a bit and they are very different games. There are three deciding factors to keep in mind. Price, difficulty and length. Mansions is a lot more expensive (although maybe in the long run cheaper), it is an very easy game that you can just grab with a friend or two and run a game after 5 min of explanation (really) but the length of Mansions is a lot longer compared to a scenario of Arkham LCG. Mansions might have bit more replayability then Arkham LCG but it might hit the table a bit less because of long game time.

I enjoy both on their on merrits and couldn't really advice you on that. I guess I would like Mansions just a bit more if it would have one or two shorter scenarios (45-60 min) because then it would hit the table more. 

For solo I guess I like Arkham LCG a bit more because of the shorter game time. With a few friends I would like Mansions more, because it's so much fun to explore a graveyard and kill zombies and find out what's going on!
Arkham has just been released and is a pain to find. Mansions of madness might be sold out/between printings. 

Check availability first, it may be a deciding factor. 

Madness is great if you have a TV connected to a PC with a wireless mouse overlooking the gaming area. 

Arkham kinda needs two copies of the core set or an expansion for deck customisation options. With a single core, it's just add all the cards of your characters two colours and some neutrals. 

5 characters, playing two at a time, two full campaigns, before you've kinda played all the basics. That's about 9 hours worth of content. 

Mansions of madness, it's 4 scenarios, without any of the bonus material. Shortest is 90, longest is like 4 hours. I think mansions has the edge on content value. 
I've played both quite a lot and enjoy both of them immensely. It's really hard to recommend one over another.

Do you value miniatures and visual immersion over the persistent campaign? If you do, go with Mansions of Madness. I personally prefer the campaign play in Arkham Horror TCG and the permanent effects you'll get during the scenarios. It really feels more personal and you'll become more attached to your investigator. MoM has no character development whatsoever.

The replay value is pretty much the same in both games, maybe leaning a bit more towards the AH:TCH since it has clearer differences between the characters/classes and playing the campaign again with another character may feel very different. Mansions of Madness has a decent replay value too with different outcomes and some randomisation (although I would love to see more of it). It is, however, harder to control how much of the new stuff you'll be able to see on the following playthroughs.

Playing time is one of the biggest differences. AH generally plays faster than MoM. MoM has a few shorter scenarios but it also has a couple of really long ones so if you prefer shorter sessions, AH is better for you.

Lastly, can you commit to play through the campaign with you SO? With Mansions of Madness you can change the player count without issues every time you play the game but if you start AH with two, you'll be more or less stuck with that amount of players through the game. You can play solo after you've started with two but you basically can't go back to two after playing alone.

I would also like to point out that you really don't need two core sets for Arkham Horror unless you're a minmaxer. You have plenty of options with one core set and you'll be getting more with the expansions so I do not recommend buying two core sets before you've played through the first campaign and decided yourself whether you'll need more options or not. I personally like the uniqueness the single core box causes since you can't have multiple copies of each card in your deck and especially with both investigators in play. For me it's more thematic that way.

Also you don't need a TV setup for MoM. We have to option to connect on TV but usually we use a tablet and either rotate it from player to another or only one person handles the app. I feel it's really weird if everyone just keeps staring at the screen silently (while reading the texts) instead of focusing on the actual game and someone reading the text aloud.
Eureka Miniatures does a wide range of sculpts at decent prices. They have a cultists range from memory which might help with your cthulhu game.
http://www.thecombatcompany.com/ has a pretty large range of mini's for decent prices. Though it sounds more like you are looking specifically for Cthulhu based sculpts.

There is a kickstarter running at the moment here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rykarjove/hp-lovecraft-cthulhu-mythos-the-great-old-ones-ii?ref=category that has some unique sculpts if that is the kind of thing you were looking for.

Hope this helps.
Is it Munchkin? Description sounds oddly similar to it. There's probably a number of other games that fit the description but that was the first thing to come to mind.
We're trying to keep track of them here:  http://www.boardgameprices.com/articles/best-board-game-deals-on-black-friday-2016

**Jet.com with GMA30 gets you 30%** off one order save up to $30 on the total order.  **Pandemic Legacy for $29.95, Blood rage $36.54**.  After 35$ you get free shipping, that's 35$ before the 30% discount, so Pandemic Legacy is under $30 shipped if you are in a place you don't have to pay taxes.  This isn't a first three orders deal either.  Anyone can use it.

So far the best deal I have seen on board games.
B&N has by one get one 50% off board games.

Additionally there is a Black Friday 30% off one item coupon out there.

I did that today and got **Above and Below** and **The Big Book Of Madness** for a total of 30 bucks. 
An examination of CamelCamelCamel shows that Black Friday shopping for board games usually won't save you that much money. Cheapest prices happen in the summer generally -- lots of games are actually significantly more expensive today than they were earlier this year.
Amazon has a bunch of the Queen games deeply discounted. Kingdom Builder is a steal right now. 
[Picked up Champions of Midgard for $35 with free shipping](http://www.greyfoxgames.com/games/champions-of-midgard/)

*edited: added link*
I picked up Grand Austria Hotel from Amazon for $45, not sure if it's a BF deal but that's the cheapest I've seen it. Been wanting that one for a while. 
I've been tracking https://boardgamegeek.com/forum/10/boardgamegeek/hot-deals for the last week or so. Most of the items in /r/boardgamedeals are just reposts from there, so I just go to the source instead.
The Contender: The game of presidential debate is 50% off plus free shipping with the GOBBLE code. http://thecontender.us/collections/black-friday-deals/
Amazon has a few decent discounts. 

Arkham Horror - 39.99
Pandemic - 19.99
Code Names - 6.99
7 Wonders - 27.99

Still looking around to find some other deals
I'm seeing Alhambra for $16.39.  Never played it... is it worth buying?
Place in Madison, got claustrophobia for 30 and black fleet for 10
/r/Boardgamedeals 
Where's mine!?!?!?
Really looking forward to both of them, but I ordered through a retailer and they are getting theirs shipped now, after all the orders direct from Splotter, so I've got a while to wait.
I'm waiting for Food Chain Magnate to be re-printed.

Their website states there's no plans on a re-print but it's down to demand.

Is "The Great Zimbabwe" similar to FCM?
They've been in my FLGS ever since the owner brought them back from Essen, as well as copies of Roads & Boats and Duck Dealer. I think FCM has gone now, but he still has TGZ and Indonesia.

I guess there isn't a huge demand for Splotter games around here?

What do I win? A copy of the game?
Eh, you're not missing much. The components don't help: impossibly small coins, dark and hard-to-see glossy board...and the game was merely okay at best. I wanted to love it, but gave it away.
The first game has more content. But the content is... rough. I've played all of each and I recommend 2nd edition 10x over vs first
Played both, own 2E. It's my favorite game of the year (and this was a really good year for games!).

1E is great, but it's super fiddly to set everything up and the entertainment value relies heavily on the DM making decisions that are interesting to the entire group. That means that having a competitive-minded player as the DM can sometimes make for a pretty miserable experience all around if their only goal is winning.

With 2E, the app does a brilliant job at handling this. On the first play of each scenario, you don't even know what your goal is, and the exploration aspect of the game feels thrilling as the story slowly comes together. On later plays, the map layout/creatures/items are shaken up a bit to create more of a puzzle. I've replayed a few of the scenarios several times and I'm still enamored. I do recommend the add-on tilepacks (they provide additional scenarios, but the the app will sometimes use those new components in the old scenarios as well), however I don't find them necessary. You can get a lot of mileage out of just the base game scenarios.
I didnt like 2E at all.  The stories were interesting, but the mechanics where someone basically stares at a puzzle on their phone for a couple actions is god awful.
I'm curious too. Cause everyone is so hyped that FFG dropped the dungeon master, that the app does so many things etc, etc... but is the game actually better than playing with an DM player? I have **Imperial Assault** which will get a simmilar app soon. I've seen the **Descent** one and I can't possibly imagine playing like this beeing better than vs. a live player.
Simple question. Do you want to play 1 versus all, or a co-op game using an electronic device?

I have the first edition with one expansion, and I adore it, but I like the 1 versus all concept.

The first edition isn't very much available though, and won't receive any more expansions.
I've found a first edition version online already which is why I'm so conflicted because the second edition is pricy but is it worth it? I heard game play can get stale with the 2nd since the app doesn't have too much to offer so I would need to get more expansions ASAP as well is from what I'm understanding I'm just so conflicted because I've never played either of them 
Thank you all so much this has helped a lot 
Didn't play the 1st but I really, really like the 2nd.  The way the app integrates is beautiful and the story is still compelling.  


2nd edition has been better received than 1st. Personal preference aside, it is the better bet.

If you really cannot decide and have cash to burn; there is a synergie to buying both. you can use the conversion kit that comes with 2nd edition to turn the 1st edition components into a 2nd edition expansion. It's only an effective option if you want to own both editions. Otherwise you can buy nicer versions of the expansion components in an expansion box.
**Get the third edition!**
My dad has worked on car upholstery all his life.. I'll check with him in the morning and post a followup. :)
If you look at the manufacturers site, sometimes they describe foams in detail. Sometimes they have a water resistant side, or a side meant to be glued down. Problem is...either of those could be the smoother side 
If you're already a /r/boardgames subscriber, I'd suggest getting into the lore of the Warhammer first via one of the Warhammer board games! 

**Space Hulk Death Angel** is a nice, relatively simple one that can be played solo or co-op, and introduces integral Warhammer 40k concepts such as the Void, Space Hulks, Tyranids, Genestealers, and of course several chapters of Space Marines.

If you're looking for Warhammer Fantasy stuff, **Talisman** covers lots of things about the existing races and such. It's a rather simple but surprisingly pretty fun roll and move game.

After that, get yourself to the Warhammer subreddit and have them explain it.
The problem with Warhammer Fantasy isn't that it's expensive. It's slightly overpriced because of the brand name, but you get high quality models generally. You have large scale battles (if you want small scale, there's tons of better alternatives) and that of course costs money. Then you need a large space, several books, terrain and various miscellaneous stuff. This is because the game has amassed a ton of content and because of its scope. The cost of the game is fine and expected.

However, regardless of which edition you choose (the current one is detested by fans because it's not focused around min-maxing army lists) you will face the actual problem: the game play and "strategy" is superficial and unnecessarily time consuming. Making your army list perfect is hugely important; making a unit an even number of models for aesthetics can be extremely punishing.

Your army list and deployment is easily the two biggest decisions you will make and decide at least 50% of the outcome of the battle. Think about that. Before you start actually playing the battle, an experienced player can look at your setup and fairly accurately predict the outcome of the battle regardless of how either of you play and what you roll on the dice.

The list building and setup routinely takes 1-2 hours for people who are experienced with the game. Playing the actual battle takes 3+ hours on top of that. Most of your decisions are made in the first half of the battle, after you get into close combat (which is the meat of the game) the game gives you almost no choices to make. In close combat you can decide to target special characters or whole units, that's usually it. Sometimes there's a special rule to activate but most of them are completely automatic.

Look at battle reports. Those I know that still like Warhammer like BRs so I think it's a good indication if you will like the game if we ignore the aspects of collecting, painting, etc. When you watch the BRs, try to pay attention to every choice given to the players and if those choices are actually meaningful. After setup I can generalize from experience that each player makes about a dozen meaningful, non-obvious decisions. In a game that takes 4-5+ hours. That's my problem with Warhammer.
You have a choice Wargame Fantasy or the sci-fi version 40,000 commonly known as 40k.

Regardless,just buy one of the Battleboxes that comes with everything you need to get started except the paints and glue. 

That I believe is what you were asking and you are at the wrong place. 

If you wanted the boardgame and not the miniatures wargame, then read their replies. 
Go to a games workshop store if you have one nearby and chat with the workers there.

If not a GW shop go to your LGS. That way you can find out what the scene is like.

You don't want minis and books sitting around unplayed.

Unless someone on Reddit lives in your area I don't think there's better advice.
Seconding Death Angel. It's pretty affordable (for now) and a lot of fun whether you're playing solo or co-op.

Also seconding getting into the lore. There are plenty of websites out there for you to find it on (Lexicanum and/or DakkaDakka are good ones to start with). Not to mention the wealth of video games that are out there that give you a feel for the universe (Dawn of War, Space Marine, etc).
Also try r/warhammer
MTG: arena of the planes walkers and the game it's based on. You can build your own terrain and everything.
Dust tactics and Imperial assualt 
You might try the quick play battletech variants: Alpha Strike with the hex rules, or the older BattleForce rules.

Will be hard pressed to play a 4 foot map, though. 
Old school BattleBall had a long   player board. Pretty great thrift store find if you happen to stumble upon it. I think Dust Tactics had a pretty big board set up as well. 4x4 seems pretty big for a board game though, this is mostly tabletop skirmish dimensions. OR just pick up a Battlemat and Frostgrave as well as some minis, now thats a great game!
**Project: ELITE**.  I'm not sure if it's quite 4', but it does strike me as a very large board.
Rivet Wars from Cool Mini or Not. Alternate time line WWI miniatures game... Very video game like. One of my favorites!
You might want to track down a copy of Milton Bradley's [Battle Masters](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/700/battle-masters). A decent game for it's time with a hex based vinyl map @ about 4.5x4.5 ft.
You're in luck you can go back the Kingdom Death Kickstarter right now. The board is pretty big but not quite four feet big. It doesn't need to be that big though because a fight is usually four survivors versus some sort of monster, not two armies.
Heroscape is a rough to find one that'd be right up your alley probably, massive 3d board for that one.  Arena of the Planeswalkers is a close second.

Have you thought about Battle Lore though? Large board, hexes, and its an excellent game.  Memoir 44 is the same system as well but WW2 themed.
Haven't played them both but afaik **Quadropolis** and **Blueprints** have that architectural theme. **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** may also be of interest but I'm not 100% sure. Another one which I played is **Alhambra** - a tile laying game where you have to build a castle-like structure within certain guidelines. All of them are worth checking out at the very least. 
the game you want is clinic 

castles of mad king ludwig is fine but the game you really want is clinic
**Castles of Mad King Ludwig** 

Literally about designing houses/castles, room by room. This is the game for your dad.

Most of the other games suggested here are about Town Planning, not architecture. 
New york 1901

About great architecture around the turn if last century 
**Suburbia** is a great city building game - as a civil engineer I really enjoy it.

**Dream Home** is a new one I haven't played but might be of interest.
Small City
I'm an "architectural designer", not an architect yet but maybe he might be interested in some of my favorite games!

**Medina** is a beautiful game that ends up looking like a 3d city. just the way it looks makes my coworkers play the game. It's pretty fun game too!

**Santorini** 's new edition should be coming out soon. I played it when it was still PnP but everything looks better now. Beautiful game

he might also enjoy games with spatial aspects like **patchwork** , **Pueblo** and **Town Center**
I was an arch student, and I *love* **Quadropolis**, **Suburbia** and **Imhotep**. Watching the things growing is really satisfying. Also I don't actually care too much about winning in these games, I like a pretty city built and that's good.

Now if you need something heavier, I'm looking at **Tramways** for a pretty long time too.
There's also **Bruxelles 1893** and **Burano** that kinda has the architect feel.
How about Sagrada? 
So maybe not quite what you're thinking of, but I'd go for **Go Cuckoo**. I have a friend who's a civil engineer and he absolutely kills at these kinds of games because he's got a leg up on understanding structural weight distribution.

There's also a very limited-run game called **Jutaku** that [ran on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jordandraper/jutaku) a few months ago and is just getting fulfilled - there are a handful of copies available to buy direct from the designer but it doesn't look like it's going to go into any more production.
Check out Star Wars: Imperial Assault if you're in any way a Star Wars fan.
I strongly recommend the new Conan game. It's what I've been looking for after playing games like Descent. I really tried to like Descent. I played it for about 20 hours. I could never get into it, and my friends couldn't really either. It just feels restrictive and artificial, with no strong theme to hold it together. It always felt like the heroes were getting in each other's way. 

Conan, by contrast, is a new favorite of my group. We've played about 8 times in the month since I got it. It feels open and free. Players can take as many actions as they want, assuming they have the energy. And in any order. And there's no grid, so you aren't trying to get around each other. It's just fun. And you aren't checking the rules all the time like we did with Descent. 

I highly recommend Conan over Descent or it's clones like Imperial Assault. Especially over the long term since all of us are already excited to create our own scenarios and campaigns like we did in the 90's with Heroquest.  
Maybe Gloomhaven (or my favorite dungeon crawler at the moment, Omega Protocol).
Galaxy defenders is a great game, granted it's Sci fi themed. 

The same company is releasing a fantasy one soon called "Sword and sorcery". 

Check out gloomhaven as well. 
**Zombicide: Black Plague**

**Arcadia Quest**
I'm a huge fan of MYTH, but it's a pretty niche following.

You can currently get [the Base game and two expansions](http://store.megacongames.com/collections/frontpage/products/black-friday-myth) for $150 on their Black Friday deal. The expansions just shipped last week, so they are brand new content.

The only real downfall is not getting the extra Kickstarter stuff that came with these pledges originally.

It probably plays best with 4, but we play with 5. There are five classes in the base game and one each additional in the expansions.

I just [finished painting](http://i.imgur.com/ao4Od1y.jpg) some of the minis from the expansion.
**The Others: 7 Sins**
Uh, Kingdom Death Monster? 
GenCon because you can craft the experience to fit most any of the other Cons. You want to just play board games? Done. You want a massive sales floor? Done. Do what you want, there's so much to do.
Do you want to play games and games and more games.  Don't really care much about vendors?  

Bgg is better then gencon in that reguard.  

Want to see a whoel bunch of super vendors and get a bunch of cool early releases and promos?  Don't mind spending a lot of cash to play games and go to events.  Then gen con can't be beat. 

Bgg at Sea is a vacation first.  Do you like where they are cruising too?  It's basically a cruise where instead of sitting around a pool you can sit around playing games every evening and at sea day.   
I think it depends what you want to see and do. If you want to catch the latest game releases sounds like GenCon(live in North America)or Essen(live in Europe). If it's to play games and meet people BGG.com or Dicetower con. For me I would pick Dicetower Con, it sounds like a nice sized convention with lots of gaming and the Dicetower crew seem like a fun bunch. Never been to any of these but hope to one day.
GenCon. Not that I'll ever go to any of them as Iive in the UK
Compiling what others have said and phrasing it this way: If you're not sure what you want, the answer to your question is "GenCon." Because everything is there. Paraphrasing Gary Oldman, [everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrTsuvykUZk).
BGG con if you are looking for 4 days of nonstop boardgaming and a decent selection of vendors and new releases.
GenCon all day everyday
not that I've been to the other two, but GenCon is great. I'm not a huge gamer but went the last two years with the boyfriend and 15-20 of our gaming group. nearly every night we'd stay up late to play games and drink in the hotel lobbies. basically the whole downtown is very welcoming to the attendees
Geekway in St Louis would be my one and only if I had to choose.

Between your two BGG all day. GenCon is not as awesome as it used to be.
If I had to choose personally I would go either GenCon or Spiel Essen. And Dice Tower Con ofc :).
Maybe [Gloomhaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdRirVHY3Qc)? It's a $100 game being released in January for Kickstarter backers and general preorders ([still open](http://www.cephalofair.com/)). It's a legacy style game with a persistent world for 1-4 players. Not for everyone for sure. You're looking at 95 story driven scenarios (little dungeons for about 60-120 minutes each) in addition to traveling through the open world and of course the city Gloomhaven itself. Character customization through items, unique abilities (think cleave for warriors, flame strike for mages, stealth for rogues etc...) and class perks.
There really isn't much out there like it. One recent kickstarter seems to have similar mechanics, minus the absurd amounts of dice. Though it is complete. Wish there were more like it. I am mixed on the expansions, they make the game much longer which can be an issue.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanaaberg/dungeon-degenerates-hand-of-doom-fantasy-board-gam
Descent second edition whit the app is by far your best choice :)
**Pocket Hive**.

Okay I'm actually out of ideas now.
Lost Cities and Battle Line are great 2 player card games that don't take up a lot of space.
Battlecon, Battlecon, Battlecon. It is a board game that replicates 2D fighting games.

Not only is it the best 2 player game I have(by a landslide), but it also scales up to 5 players. There are 3 standalone sets, one come with cards that you can use as the board so you can fit most of the gme in a couple deckboxes. If you getball 3 sets then it becomes one of the best at home games as well. TONS of content, lots of variants that even includes a 1-3 player puzzle dungeon crawler mode.
Well, there are always boardgame apps. Carcassonne, Patchwork, and Star Realms are apps I have used and enjoyed for 2 player games.

Patchwork and Star Realms physical copies don't take up much space. Hanabi, Valley of the Kings, and Pocket Hive are all pretty small and fun with two players.
As a mountaineer, I've been making a list of the smallest games in terms of weight, which isn't the same thing as volume, but you should find a lot of crossover:

These are two-player specific:

 * **Sellswords** 
 * **Star Realms**
 * a couple decks of **Battleground: Fantasy Warfare**
 * **Deckbuilding: the Deckbuilding Game**
 * **Niya**
 * **Epic Card Game**

These are not specific to two players but aren't terrible for it either:

 * **Love Letter**
 * **Sushi Go**
 * **Innovation**

**Tiny Epic Kingdoms** and **Tiny Epic Galaxies.** have the distinction of being 4x-ish games with quite a bit of depth for how small they are.

Lots of the other suggestions here are great too.
Guillotine and Fluxx are pretty minimal on space requirements

Edit: Also Gloom, but it does have quite a few cards. 
7 Wonders: Duel (sans box) is one of the leading candidates since we play it a lot and enjoy it. Anyone played the expansion?

Any other games that might be unpacked to travel better? 
Both **San Juan** and **Race for the Galaxy** are engine building euro games made up of basically just cards. They are very similar games, with Race being the more complicated of the 2. I would recommend checking out both. **Mottainai** and **Innovation** are both card games by Carl Chudyk which are very unique and complex for their small size. His games take a few plays to really grasp well but a lot of people really love them. 
Spendor
Tides of Time and Tides of Madness - 18 cards and a few tokens, small box and small footprint, drafting 

Condottiere - deck of cards, small board and small box

Arboretum - small box card game, larger footprint  than the games mentioned above, tableau-builder style

Tiny Epic... - small boxes, not so small footprints

Jaipur, my dude. Endless fun in a small little box. 
Quarto! travel edition
Playing boardgames live almost never works out well. They should have just recorded a gameplay of it so they could have put out a well polished version.
I now this is just my personal opinion and might not be well received in this thread, but now I'm glad I didn't back this. It just doesn't pull me in at all and it feels fiddly. 
Well, between this and KDM , I can see obvious winner...
I just read some posts in the kingdom death thread and actually that sounded very much like what dark souls should be if it were made into a board game. 
Thinking about getting a refund on my pledge. But those minis and bonuses look so Dark Souls. Also, could I use those minis for KD:M?
The only way I see to get the physical game is to split the cost with friends. This also ensures you'll have people who stick through the campaign. 

If you want to try it out first you should get tabletop simulator on your computer, it's on sale this weekend. [Kingdom Death](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620390853&searchtext=) is on there and you can try out a few attacks or plan strategy. 
Yeah, from what I've seen I'd enjoy it.

But for the money I can get multiple games I'd also enjoy.

The minis are lovely, but I really wish they did a version without them for a more sensible price.
Open spots now in the Black Friday Gold Lantern level, they upped it to 2000 backers if anyone is interested. 
So I'm relatively new to the hobby (under a year) and loving having choice and different game types for my brother and I to play. My wife dips her toe in every once in awhile too. I'm a gamer at heart and have always been heavy on video games especially immersive rpgs. 

Now I know board gaming is different than video gaming but I have been trying to scratch that same itch on the tabletop. Descent, mom 2nd, Arabian nights, eldritch horror, time stories and even the new Arkham lcg all satisfy some part of what I'm looking for here. 

I recently had the opportunity to hang out with an old childhood friend way more into boardgames than me and who had a copy of KDM. Wow what a game. We played for 3 hours and I've been thinking about it since. 

The idea of building a settlement over just managing a dude or two really hit me. It has the long game in mind and my mind puts in a check mark. 

Customization! Choice in growth! Check check. 

Hard choices with ramifications that effect you later. Check. 

Plays great at 1 or 2 people. Great to look at. Difficult. All these things YES!

I completely understand your hesitancy. Spending console money on one box of plastic and cards? For me however, there was no way I would miss the opportunity to own this gem of a game. I think this will in a sense, retire a lot of other games I have. Summer of next year can't get here fast enough. I feel like I'm a kid again waiting on Christmas. Not too much in this world does that to a 38 year old. 

Happy gaming!
I'm definitely with you. I'm watching the page as well, suffering from a strong case of fomo. 

I love the art style, the gameplay sounds awesome, and the minis look amazing. The only things making me stall is that my wife probably won't appreciate the art style and I don't have a group that will appreciate the intricacy of the game. 
You can get a LOT of playtime out of the game, but you really have to enjoy putting together miniatures (even better if you like painting them too), otherwise you're basically paying for a lot of things you're never going to use, considering there's a TON of armor sets you can mix and match to create your miniatures. It's definitely one of a kind though, very fun but something you'll need to set up a consistent meet up to get through, unless you're playing solo.
I agree it's more a game system than just a standalone game. It feels more like you brought home a big crate of new RPG books and also a ton of minis than a big minis board game like Massive Darkness, just from the campaign focus, open-endedness and focus on boutique minis. So I liken the cost to buy-in to a collectible hobby as opposed to a one-off game. Ex: cost to get into a complete-in-a-box game: $30-100, depending on chrome. Cost to get into, let's say, Star Wars Armada, a pretty blingy collectible game: core set plus whatever ships you want for your perfect fleet, $150-250. And that's until meta shifts and you need to update again. Also, much like the collectible game (and much like most GW products) KDM is a Lifestyle Game. It's designed to be the primary thing you spend money on/play, and not an every-once-in-a-while game. So one may buy less other games while deep into KDM, but if that's not what you're looking for then it night just make it out occasionally and be a huge black paperweight else wise.

All in all I think these are caveats. If you don't want to buy into a Lifestyle Game and invest the time and money to get the best out of it, and just want something cheaper/more casual/just different, look elsewhere, because your money won't be well-spent here. But if it grabs you like a collectible game grabs a poor innocent soul who thinks "maybe I'll play Warhammer now", you won't be disappointed.
You could get some friends to go in with you, commit to play, and split the cost. 

If I were interested in getting a game for the prices I'm seeing there, that's definitely how I'd do it. 
The kickstarter doesn't end until January, so you have a month to check out game play videos or even play it on tabletop simulator to decide if its for you.
I missed the original kickstarter. Kicked myself for a long time after it for not pledging. Then I managed to get a copy after it was sold out , for a very reasonable price. 

Truth is the game is expensive. But its not a game, it's a gaming system. You won't have buyers remorse when you get it, in fact it will become your pride and joy amoung yoir collection.
Laser Attack or Dragonmaster

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2/dragonmaster

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6119/laser-attack
My bet is also on Dragonmaster. Whilst I don't remember the game exactly-being I had it when I was around 10ish, I do seem to recall the tactile feel of the clicky/semi=modular gems. 

I will be adding this game to my wishlist. thank you.
I'd give the shirt off my back to at least try it. 
I'd play it immediatly

Ugh, no thanks. I play board games to *get away* from my day job.
From the album title I was expecting a Euro about furniture production. :-l
We'll need more pics.
Are the free tickets gone? If not, you must try and redeem them! 
Grandma was down to bone.
When you are done, please send it to the Flip the Table guys...
Looks like a monopoly re-skin, any idea what the gameplay is OP?
Wait. There's a collar/bow tie made of cardboard. Is someone supposed to strip?
I know at least 10 people this would get completely out of control with. Good find! 
I'd play this game any day with Farley
Send it to Flip the Table. I want to hear them play it. 
When the second dude from the left on the boxtop *is* wearing a shirt, I bet it offers free mustache rides.
When every gameboard was based on Monopoly's.
Ahhh shit.  Someone's getting a mustache ride.

Heads up, they won't price match in stores :(. Just tried last night since I forgot to bring my games to my relatives this vaca weekend. Still picked it up as a 2nd copy for house since it's not expensive. 
Can we get this post flared US Only? It doesn't apply for many of us foreigners. 
awesome deal!
If nothing else, great math trade fodder. 
Everyone should own a least 1 copy of codenames. It never fails.
Any deals for "Pictures"?
Holy shit, great price for a great game!
I recently discovered Imhotep and it is such a great gem. Excelent game to introduce to family and friends outside the hobby as well.
I did some playtesting for it, and have played the final version. It's okay, but not one of Eric's best designs. I have no attachment to the source material though, so your mileage may vary.
As a boardgame fan, it's a solid design. Collaborative game built around the Chalice Dungeons. Hits some notes that make it feel like a more confrontational Broom Service. 

As a Bloodborne fan, it's not as thematically deep as I would like. If more of my board game friends were avid Bloodborne players, It would be quite satisfying, sitting around, talking Workshop, and reminiscing (lamenting) about the times we encountered all the beasts and kin in the box. The game play on its own doesn't scream Bloodborne. 

That said, I did pick up a copy as a conversation piece with Bloodborn fans, and in hopes that it might drive Cool Mini or Not to produce a big box Bloodborne game. 
It replaced king of Tokyo for me. No player elimination push your luck...enjoy it well enough to keep it in the collection .

Don't expect the videogame though...they only share the theme and the idea that any enemy can spank you mercilessly
It's a solid enough design.  There are some neat little decisions and plenty of satisfying player interaction. I'd probably turn it down if someone offered to play it at a meetup again, though. There are just too many more interesting uses of time.
Its alright.  Simplified version of Cutthroat Caverns if you have played that.  You would probably get enough enjoyment out of it being a huge fan of the video game, but after a few plays you'll realize it's a little thin on content.  Played twice now at 3 and 5 player counts, the latter definately the better.  Doubt it will ever hit the table again.   
Got this game recently and really like it. If you are a fan of the video game you will automatically love the artwork and the weapons and enemies . You can play under an hour and there is enough there to keep me coming back. I like that its easy to teach and learn which makes it a good option for new gamers. It is my new go to palate cleanser game, not a feature game.

In my opinion the games depth depletes a little if you only have 3 people. Players get trophies for participating in the enemy kills and with 3 almost every player gets a hit in on every enemy. With 5 players is much more interesting as the 4th player has to choose to deal instant damage, heal, or expect the turn to make it to them. 
Overall the tone of your responses is kind of leaning negative, but I'll say that I think it's solid for what it is. It is a bit light, but it's great at doing so. The decisions are interesting and easy to grasp so you get into it real quick. There's lots of player interaction and our games featured plenty of negotiation and table talk. The theme isnt super strong though other than the monsters being brutal at times, but if a quick (<45 mins) highly interactive game where you can push your luck and hurt your opponents sounds fun then I'd recommend the game. It's not our main feature at game nights, but I think we'll be pulling this out for a while for a warm up or closer.
Compared to Cutthroat Caverns, Bloodborne imho isn't worth it; At least from what I've seen. Cutthroat caverns has different monsters altering the way you do combat, it has varying attack damage/modifiers depending on what you draw, and has a substantial encounter variety with using 9 monsters per game out of the 25 possible. It also has this competitive nature too since like bloodborne you need get a hit on the monster (in this case you need to get last hit). 

So if you aren't too stingy on the theme, I would suggest Cutthroat Caverns instead. I myself considered getting Bloodborne before, but unfortunately it doesn't hold a candle to CC. And btw, CC has so many expansions if you are looking for more which adds an insane level of variety and customizability for your character.
**Survive: Escape from Atlantis** is always a big hit with everyone I play it with. Plays 4, but there is an expansion that allows up to 6. You can get the expansion combo pack that includes all three expansions for like $16. 
King of Tokyo would probably be a good one for you.   Easy to understand and fun to play.  Plus being primarily luck based it helps the young ones have a chance. 
Rhino hero is pretty great for all ages.  Group of older people? Make it a drinking game, younger kids (younger than yours)  turn it into a coop game while just trying to get as high as possible.  Kids at your ages would have fun with it just playing the way the rules are written.  

My kids also really enjoy love letter, klask, junk art,  Cockroach poker,  codenames (pictures as well as the original), sushi go (and party), zombie dice (there are lots of different versions if zombies are not appropriate) and ticket to ride.  Jaipur and Mr jack pocket are also good at those ages but only 2 player (jaipur is great to start the hobby with) 
I'm 100% convinced the game you're looking for is the 2015 Kennerspiel des Jahres winner **Broom Service**. The game plays up to 5 people, is a good mix of strategic and fun, and has a theme I think that can appeal to your daughters. 
Other Positives:
-- Comes with mini-modules to increase complexity if desired
-- Non-Violent Theme, Colorful Board
-- I believe one of the podcast hosts of Blue Peg Pink Peg had a segment about his daughter really enjoying the game 

Basic Description: Each player controls two witches looking to deliver magic potions to castles. In each round, from their own pool of 10 cards (identical to other players), each player chooses 4 secretly. Whenever a player plays a card, they choose the Brave Action (better) or the Cowardly Action (safe, not as effective). Everyone else in clockward order also reveals if they chose that as one of their 4 for the round. If a player chooses the Brave Action, any player before who also chose the Brave Action instead gets no action, while any player choosing cowardly gets to immediately perform their action. 

The first 10 minutes or so might be a little confusing, but the gameplay is very straight-forward after the initial card playing is understood. Of the 10 cards, many overlap in their function with few differentiation. 
**Deep Sea Adventure**, maybe. It's a dice-rolling push your luck game.

Rhino Hero is a fun family game so is escape but they both play quick it sounds like your looking for something better suited for a family game night setting.  Honestly there are many games that fit the bill it's going to come down to what kind of family they are and how they interact with one another

**Dixit** A simple story telling game. [tabletop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6UlbxeDE0w&t=112s) played it 


So, the other day I brought **Battle Sheep** to the family Thanksgiving, started playing it with adults, and the kids literally flocked to it and got quickly addicted.  There were three girls and a boy, ages 7-10 ish. 

I was surprised how much they liked it because it's an abstract strategy game that can be mean when you cut off other players.  They loved that though and were probably really pulled in by the cute sheep tokens.

It's neat because it appeals to adults and kids.

Only downside for your situation is, it only plays up to 4.  :-(
I'd like to know about this as well. It's frustrating how US-centric this place can be sometimes.
Also in the same camp.

I got it even cheaper last Sunday for £18.59

Edit: Sorry, Amazon UK
Quite a few board game apps are cheap, not quite what you're after though. Afraid it's mostly just America.
I think most UK places are backing out. Board Game Guru certainly is after the amount of flack Paul suffered last year over it.

I've been looking for a review of the newest version of this game, thanks for providing! I actually found a copy of the original version at a garage sale, complete and unopened. It's neat, but it seems to be nearly unplayable (my friend and I ended up at a stalemate before the game even entered the endgame). From what I hear, the new version does away with the roll-and-move mechanic that made the original so pointless. I'm looking forward to your review.
I think the reason you've yet to het any answere is that all of these are great and quite similar in complexity and feel. Also, I din't think in matters much since you have all of them and sooner or later you'll play all of them. That said, I'd go with Imperial Assault, I think the individual missions aren't too long and the game flows well. I'd recommend you read through the mission before playing it (I'm assuming you'll be playing the Empire) so things run smoothly. Make sure you know the rules well, we needed a few clarifications during our games.
Check out [Cube Quest](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137330/cube-quest).
Go buy a bucket of plastic army men and a marble. Get creative and set them up on two teams and take turns rolling the marble at them to knock them over. 

Flexibility, variability, and cheap. Meets your goal of destruction without paying for a "fancy" board game with loads of rules and limited destruction. 
**Codenames** seems like a no brainer here. Easy to understand and can really accommodate as many people as you want. I'd also recommend **For Sale**. It's a great filler that is easy to teach and understand and a fun of ton to play. Unfortunately it only plays up to 6 but I think it's excellent.
How heavy of a game are you looking for?

Fluxx is light and fast (supports up to 6 players). There a variety of themes for you to choose from, it's easy to learn/teach, and it plays pretty fast.

Gloom is a pretty fun game, but I think you'd need the core game + an expansion to do five players.

Munchkin is a pretty great game for mid size groups. Anytime I get it out I usually have a pretty good time.

If you're looking for a heavier game I would very much recommend Eldritch Horror. Really fun with groups or you can even play it solo. Lot's of teamwork involved. It's a challenging game, but it is a lot of fun.

Mice and Mystics is great as well if you're looking for something more like an RPG, but I think it only goes up to 4 players. I'm sure someone has some homebrewed stuff for more players though.

I know a lot of people enjoy Love Letter too, so there's another one you could take a look at it.
**Bohnanza**

**Deep Sea Adventure**

**Junk Art**
Bang! Fast playing and at time hilarious. Also, its more fun to call it a pugnale vs knife. 
**Diamant**/**Incan Gold**.

Simple push your luck game that plays up to 8

this is a long shot but is it Twixt?

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/949/twixt
Sure sounds like **Twixt** to me.  The posts are red and black, and the bridges are the exact length of a knight's move.  Invented by the great Alex Randolph.
I know what you're talking about, but I don't know the name. Sorry.
If you can hold off for the Anniversary edition I would do so. In the meantime there are titles like Caverna that can keep you sated until then. 
I bought the Revised edition, and I love it. The artwork and shaped wooden pieces for everything are a much-needed update, in my opinion. Sure, you get less cards, but they're balanced and I find I don't always use them anyhow. There are several variants in the manual for drafting/drawing that might make the card use more prevalent; I'll have to try those soon.
FYI the Anniversary / Deluxe edition is reported to be at least $200USD
If you really want the anniversary edition you can just sell/trade your original before it comes out. 

The zman version has more cards, resources for another player, and boards for a family variant. The Mayfair version has less cards but better card balance, animal shaped meeples, and no family variant.
I'll piggy back on this thread.

Where can I buy 2016 Agricola with the 48 card deck?  I haven't seen any Black Friday sales and it seems to be out of stock of special order at many online vendors.
Based on your level of knowledge, you should absolutely get the revised edition. I got it myself, and it's a really great version of the game
Murder them and use the insurance money to buy a new family.
Sometimes people just don't like boardgames. May be better to give up and find other groups, especially if you've tried a lot of the easy to learn gateway games and they didn't stick.
Wow sounds alot like my relatives at thanksgiving.  Now some people don't like boardgames but since they like CAH it means they like games you just haven't found the right one.   You have to remember the type of games your relatives grew up with.  they are simple, roll and move type games with simple straight forward rules so what worked for me was sticking to party games and light filler games.   I'm bad at describing games so ill include a link where i can

**Spit it Out** fun little trivia game where player has to give wrong answers to 6 very simple questions but a dice roll determines questions player has to answer correctly.  [Spit It Out review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Fz83G0aic)

**Times up: Title Recall**  call it a modern version of charades where you try to get your partner to guess name of title (movie, song, etc) played in three rounds. each round limits how you give the clues.  [time's up review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rGSnQOVsCk)

**telestrations** its basically telephone and pictionary had a baby.  

**No thanks** light little card game where you try to build a sequence of cards by deciding to take a card or pay a chip to pass. [No Thanks review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-PBiZzKmAI)

**Tsuro** I call it a pathfinding game basically each player is given 3 tiles and on their turn lay one tile down creating a path keeping your token on the board while forcing other players token off the board or collide with another player eliminating both. winner is the last one remaining on the board [Tsuro playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLw40nkdTyo)

The trick to getting out of just playing party games is you need to convert some of your relatives into modern boardgame players.  It's tough trying to teach 5 gamers a new game much less a group not familiar with modern games.  If you have a relative close by maybe you could get together once a month have dinner and game night start with games like sushi go, forbidden island, Lanterns etc just a simple game that will get them familiar with modern game mechanics so that at family gatherings they can help explain and teach the game to the other family members.

It's just not going to work out with some people, sadly. I agree that you should look for other people to play with 
I have found that many people who don't play board games as a hobby tend to find the wealth of rules confusing, so prefer simple trivia games or very basic mechanics. I am surprised they didn't like Codenames, that has gone down well in my "tests", as has Cards Against Humanity (which I actually really like as a party game, but appreciate it isn't to much favour on here).

When they ask you to bring games, have you asked them what type they would like? What theme would interest them? If they are sci-fi fans, then a sci-fi based theme would have them more interested in learning how to play. 

Captain Sonar could be a great one for many players, and the real time mode although initially daunting, could actually be the thing that makes them enjoy it. I haven't played it myself, but I hear positive things.

Tsuro is a very simple game, 2-8 players, and quick/fun.

How many people are you usually playing with at thanksgiving?

PS: [This was one really good article I found on explaining rules to people](http://www.boardgameresource.com/teach-board-games-10-tips/)
I have a similar "problem" with my parents. They like to play games when they come over or when I visit but they just don't seem to "get" some games. They are used to simple abstract games or card games with numbers and colors on them.

My father is a brilliant mind and crushes all of us in chess, etc. but put some (very) light theming on a game and he doesn't know the front of a card from its back. My mother is similar, though she seems to be able to handle a bit more "theme". She still does weird things... like accusing herself of being the murderer in Deception: Murder in Hong Kong. 

With codenames my father sometimes forgot that he's only supposed to clue in on his own teams' words (completely ignoring the card with the team colors). And all of this is after they played a few rounds without any problems.

Another example: He understood Welcome to the Dungeon the second I told him to completely, absolutely, truly ignore the artwork and only! focus on the numbers. Then I went through the items and said "So this beats a 5. This beats all even cards." And suddenly it clicked for him. Up until this point he was just too confused by the game's theme. He still doesn't know what the monsters on the cards "are supposed to do".
Try Settlers. Classic easy-to-pickup gateway game. My grandpa, who only ever played chess his entire life, fell in love with it at the age of 60
I don't know about this game specifically, but couldn't you baggy everything? A custom foamcore insert is also an option, but it can be a bit of work.
Put them in bags... 
You pretty much have to get the majority of the group to 2 cards on the intuition track to have a good chance, obviously the more that can see three the better. As such, the psychics need to guess well and often: don't forget that you get your guessing tokens back at either the beginning or end of the fourth hour, can't remember exactly which. Another big help that lots of people overlook is that once a psychic figures out all three of his cards, he gets points on the intuition track equal to the number of rounds left in the game. 
I only play 3p games, but we don't play with the clairvoyancy track. At the end, all psychics see all three cards and work together to figure out the culprit. The ghost adds in 2-3 more culprits as well to make it harder. And we've lost quite a few playing this way as well.
You may already know this part but just wanted to be sure - the first card revealed has to do with the person, the second has to do with the  place, and the third has to do with the object. So, ideally it should be slightly easier than a typical round since you not only have a card to hint at your person, but another card to cross reference that with with where that person was (i.e - This card makes me think this is the maid, but she was in the kitchen and this next card totally doesn't say kitchen to me at all!) and some people may even have that third card and have even more to reference it against. Lastly, after you place any hint card (as the ghost) you immediately draw another, so you should always have 7. Hope that helps!

I started recently (almost done dwarrodelf). I've just been playing in order, starting with just 1 core (I eventually made proxies in lieu of multiple cores, $3.70 versus $80!). I've found it preferable because:

1. Getting everything at once is REALLY overwhelming. I may buy multiple packs at once, but I just store them away until I get to them because having that many cards available at once can be pretty intimidating. For example, I have all the sagas and against the shadow cycle sitting in plastic wrap somewhere (picked up on sale)

2. I get to learn everything the game has to offer without feeling like I'm cheating or using net decks.

3. I can build a deck for an adventure, play in 3-8 times (till I've mastered it), and then break down the deck and move on to the next adventure. Keeps things fresh since I'm constantly building different decks.

4. I've enjoyed having everything so far, even the mirkwood cycle cards. The adventures are often kinda meh, and the cards can be hit or miss, but some can be great or find renewed uses later.
Looks like you might end up with a sizable collection, based on what people are looking to sell. So I'll share some resources about getting into the game.

[The TFTC Buying Guide](https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/) has a lot of info about the expansion model, and ratings for each one.

[Beorn's Path](https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/) is a deckbuilding guide, starting from the core and progressing up through the first cycle and some change. This has more build and play tips than the buying guide.

And I started posting a few starter decks, alongside my weekly deck series, recently. You can find those [here, on ringsdb](http://ringsdb.com/decklists/find?sphere=&threato=%3A&threat=&author=&name=Starter+Deck&sort=popularity&packs%5B%5D=1&packs%5B%5D=8&packs%5B%5D=15&packs%5B%5D=22&packs%5B%5D=29&packs%5B%5D=36&packs%5B%5D=2&packs%5B%5D=3&packs%5B%5D=4&packs%5B%5D=5&packs%5B%5D=6&packs%5B%5D=7&packs%5B%5D=9&packs%5B%5D=10&packs%5B%5D=11&packs%5B%5D=12&packs%5B%5D=13&packs%5B%5D=14&packs%5B%5D=16&packs%5B%5D=17&packs%5B%5D=18&packs%5B%5D=19&packs%5B%5D=20&packs%5B%5D=21&packs%5B%5D=23&packs%5B%5D=24&packs%5B%5D=25&packs%5B%5D=26&packs%5B%5D=27&packs%5B%5D=28&packs%5B%5D=30&packs%5B%5D=31&packs%5B%5D=32&packs%5B%5D=33&packs%5B%5D=34&packs%5B%5D=35&packs%5B%5D=43&packs%5B%5D=44&packs%5B%5D=45&packs%5B%5D=46&packs%5B%5D=48&packs%5B%5D=49&packs%5B%5D=37&packs%5B%5D=38&packs%5B%5D=39&packs%5B%5D=40&packs%5B%5D=41&packs%5B%5D=42&packs%5B%5D=47). They're meant to get new players started with relatively few expansions and a solid deck to play the game with. I'm planning on doing another one featuring the core set and the newest deluxe expansion next Tuesday, though that might be delayed a bit if the post office isn't on top of things today.
Ive gotten in to 4 LCGs, 3 of which were after they'd already been out for a while. The way I like to do it is to simply play in release order. So you get the core, obviously, and see if you like it. Then if you do, you get the next full cycle of cards + the expansion. Then *that* should keep you occupied for a good long while. And once you feel you've played that out and you're ready to shake things up again, you move on to the *next* cycle + expansion.

I do it this way to simulate the shifts in meta as the game evolved over time. If you have *everything* available to you, it's too easy to just build with the best cards the game has to offer. By going in release order and artifical limiting your pool of cards, you force yourself to use cards that were good *for that era*. Even if they're obsolete now, you get to build decks that may not even exist anymore because they were good when those cards were still pretty new.

That's just how I do it though. It makes sense to me, but really, the big point to drive home is to not use everything at once. You can *buy* everything at once, but try to limit how much you're using. Drip it out over time to really get the most of everything. You control the way you experience these games.
I bought big used collection for 'bargain' , sold it soon after and made 3x money.
Problem is when buying big collection, building deck is such a hassel. There are hundreds of cards, you have 0 idea have half of the stuff works, and you can spend more on deck building than actually playing the game. We disliked that very much. And half of the time, you might wanna tweak your deck, depending about which scenario you play. So you spend even more time on deck building, going through all these cards...Simply, all those options are overwhelming for you when you start. And trying sort through it, to unlock cards how you play is also huge time investment.
Game is good, I am liking theme if new expansions, unfortunately I won't be playing them.

Although Arkham LCG is here, and I am starting this from begining, so it will be much easier I hope. slowly buidling and playing it.

Lotr LCG is great game, but there are downsides to buying game bunch of it in a single swoop.
As others have suggested, check out /r/lotrlcg. Also, I recommend starting with one base set and slowly adding content. Not that you have to start with early stuff, but I think it'd be easy to be overwhelmed and lose the sense of discovery and thrill when opening new packs and imagining the possibilities that the cards open up. 

Also as a shameless plug, I did a full written review of the game which is on my site www.cardboardherald.com.
Im gona ask a question that might help OP when he gets in to it, and would help me, how do people store their cards?
Do you lump all the lore in together, tactics together and so on? Or do you store them as they were released in separate packs?

I find it kinda intimidating trawling through a large set of cards to choose just a few, if I had all the lore together id be debilitated.
I have the core game and a random expansion (the fourth?) that I don't have time to play, if you want to start small. 
I will pm you a friend of mine's local listing. It's about $700 of stuff for $300, going in release order. Perfect collection. 
I'm getting rid of the box set, a bunch of the small expansions, and the first big box expansion. Mines of kandor?? I can get specifics if you'd be interested. 
LOTR LCG is my favorite game I got into it a few months ago. It's best to get a core to try it out. If you like you can either go in order of release or go in order of the Saga Expansions. If you like the game it is generally recommended you get a second core or proxy them. I have 2 cores and wouldn't mind a 3rd if it was ridiculously cheap.
My advice: Play Progression style. It's really the best way to experience the game and if you really want to get into the meta I listen to COTR (cardboard of the rings) so I can listen along to how the game was at the time. COTR will get you up to the end of the second cycle since I think that's when sites like Tales from the Cards and Beorning's Path started. 

Basically just immerse yourself into the experience and you'll have a blast. LOTR is easily my favorite game and I play it way more than I thought I would. My game consoles are just gathering dust nowadays. 
It's similarly simple and equally charming. For the money it's worth it
**Deep Sea Adventure**: Roll and move + push your luck!
As a small filler: **Zombie Dice**.

Very light, rules can be explained in less than 20 seconds, it won't take more than 15 minutes, and it's the definition of a "press your luck" game.

cons: it's a filler, don't expect to entertain a group all night with it.
All you need is 6 dice and you have farkle. They sell actual games, but its literally just 6 dice and a cup (the cup isnt necessary at all) takes less than 10 minutes to explain. 
Pass the Pigs is our groups favorite press your luck game. And the pig shaped dice are awesome. Also makes a great drinking game.
We've had some fun games of **Can't Stop**.  Might be worth a look.  Max 4 players, though.

Incan Gold is an amazing press your luck game that is super easy to teach and learn.

This may be lighter than what you're looking for but **Strike** is one of my favorite dice chucking, push you luck games. /u/r2d8 getinfo
Zombie Dice is sort of like that. You roll 3 dice at a time to try and collect brains, if you get shotgunned 3 times in one turn you lose all the brains you collected during that turn, but you can decide before you roll again if you want to keep the brains you've got, or roll again and possibly lose them all. We use it as a short warm up game usually, but we've also played with about 7 or 8 people before.
Castle Dice is one of my favorites. The press-your-luck factor comes with the cards that allow you to reroll or pick and roll again. Sometimes you get something good, other times you are leaving something better for everyone else. The expansion is also pretty neat if you prefer catered decks with a built theme as opposed to only community decks where you get what you get.
It's a fantastic game and I recommend it to anyone that I can, regardless of whether they like the D&D universe. It's a fantastic, highly interactive deck builder/area control. This expansion went immediately on my must buy list.
Ohmygosh. I am so exited, this game was designed with expansions in mind it seems but my husband and I thought it would never actually happen after the game released with such a high price point and it seemed to not get an early following because if it. 


This is nothing short of fantastic, thank you GF9!
I really enjoy Tyrants and this expansion alone will add enough variety to last a long, long time.
These expansions were probably predesigned along with the base game and it was decided beforehand that these would be released anyway. The real question is whether new ones will be designed now.
I feel that if all the good games are on one shelf, all attention will be focused on just this one particular shelf.

All of those other games on the that didn't make the cut to be on "the good shelf" are more likely to be neglected in the future. Soon you'll forget about them entirely until you add it to the "for trade" list on your BGG profile.
It's kind of like in Toy Story 3 when Andy chooses Woody to take to college  while all the other toys are put in a bag for the attic.
Supernice collection! We could definitely get along taste-wise! 

How do you find Hegemonic? And you've mistakenly put Merchants and Marauders too low xD. 
It's a poor game by just about any measure, sad to say.  But the first (1958) edition is literally the first historical wargame published.
Lords of xidit has a knock out type scoring where you first consider one aspect and the lowest score is removed and then you continue in that manner until the winner is found. The order is randomized each game.  
The new Arcadia Quest: Inferno rules. He who kills Lord Fang is ruler of the city, he with the most "badges" is the power behind the throne. 
Probably not what you're thinking of, but in **Panic on Wall Street**, there are always two winners: The richest manager and the richest investor. Basically, it's because the two types of roles play differently and brings significant differences in the amount of money you get.
I know it won't help you (as you won't be able to play it) and it's probably simpler than what you're thinking, but here in Brazil there's a card game that's going to be released this year called Contaria in wich you play cards representing characters with different scoring and abilities in order to "write" your own fairy tales and at the end of the game the players with the happiest and the saddest story (most and least points) win the game.
It's not quite what you're describing but the game Shadow Hunters has a system of hidden roles that each have their own win conditions. For the two main factions ("Shadows" and "Hunters") your win condition is just to eliminate the other team, but with 5+ players the game also has hidden Neutral characters whose win conditions are achieved independently (but are often proactive enough that they will ally with one side or another, or even switch sides midway). Therefore it's possible for one or more neutral characters to win independently but simultaneously with other players. Players can even win after being eliminated as long as their faction won, which mitigates some of the feels-bad moments of player elimination.

There's also some games like Dungeon Lords which give you points for having the best/most X at the end of the game but those points just go towards a larger tally so it's not quite the same.

Scythe rewards you for being the best at a specific objective by giving you an "achievement" and the game ends when a player reaches 6 "achievements" (but that player isn't necessarily the winner, points are scored for achievements as well as your end of game money and other accomplishments. In general 4x/Sandbox games might be the type of thing closest to what you're describing.

Lastly, even though the Lords of Xidit recommendation below doesn't seem quite what you're looking for (it's less about being the best at one thing, and more about not being the worst at anything) it's a great medium-light game with a good move-programming mechanic that I can thoroughly recommend!
Not quite sure what you're asking, there are certain aliens in **Cosmic Encounter** that give you a unique win condition, **Chaos in the Old World** has I think three possible win conditions (and one lose condition), or I guess a lot of Co-op games where people win or lose as a group and each person has to play to their unique strengths like having Patrice focus on hunting down all the clues while mostly leaving monster cleanup to Skids and Yorick in **Arkham Horror**.
Kingdom Builder awards points for various conditions at the end of the game. Sheriff of Nottingham awards points to players who have the most of each type of card at the end. Those games still have one winner at the end, but there are multiple paths to victory.
People really don't like not having an out right winner, so not sure how popular this idea could be. There are always folks in the tie breaker threads who get plain mean to people who don't mind sharing a win and when I brought up how Galaxy Trucker says everyone who made a profit won the game I actually got a rude PM.
**BluePrints** works exactly like this, of a sequence of prizes in a round
**Inis** has three win conditions: Dominate 6 figures from other players, Control an areas with 6 sanctuaries, and be present in 6 areas. Ties between wins proclaimed in the same round go to the controller of the main city.
All *COIN* games score each faction in a different way but only one can win - whichever player has surpassed their target by the most. 
Yes. Its called the US Presidential Elections.

Hahahahahahahahahaha.
Every game is like this if you buy a small package of plastic participation trophies and hand one out to everyone at the end.

(No, I can't think of any.)
Stone Age if you want a light Euro, it's basically Agricola Light. Dark Moon if you want betrayal, all you do is read a card and roll dice, the rest is all social.

Maybe 7 Wonders could work too?
Remember not everyone is going to like board games.  Sounds like your boyfriends family prefer light and casual games. I wouldn't expect to be playing dead of winter with them anytime soon.  Also don't let them not getting love letter deter you.  My mom initially couldn't wrap her head around it but Hanabi clicked for her right away. Don't worry there's still hope you just have to find the right game.  Codenames is a good start...

**Sushi go party** you could also go with regular sushi go but the party version gives you more options to customize the type of game you want.

**Hare & Tortoise** a betting / racing game has been a hit with some of my non gamer family members.

**hey that's my fish** it may look like a kids game but this is most cutthroat game i own big hit with my two uncles who don't play board games but are super competitive. 2 things to keep in mind, set up is a bit fiddly and this game has caused several heated arguments.

These are just a couple of suggestion i have more but im on my phone so ill list them when i get home

Have you tried games with a theme they really enjoy

**Colt Express**  okay now this one is iffy but if they like western movies or western themes it might be worth a go.  It will probably take one or two plays before it clicks   **flick em up** is another one that come to mind but i haven't played it.  

**last night on earth** it's a b-horror movie in board game form.  It's been hit or miss basically for those that get into the spirit of the game they enjoy it.  

Are there any classic board games that they play regularly? Clue, Monopoly, scrabble, etc.  if so [the dice tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI2Cs9VwYiE) did a top 10 of "better" games to try.  It is a bit dated but still should work for you.
I've had fantastic luck with my family starting with **Survive: Escape from Atlantis** and moving into **Sheriff of Nottingham** and **TTR**(they now own and have worn out 3 decks of cards on TTR).

All that said, don't get too discouraged if it doesn't take.  Not everyone is a gamer or meant to become one.  My father tolerates TTR because the rest of my family loves it, but he doesn't actually like boardgames.  My mother likes to play on occasion, but would never suggest playing unless my wife and I are there.  My sister and her husband however, have been converted.  

*shrug*

It is what it is, not everyone is meant to game
[deleted]
**Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia** seems what you're looking for. I was looking for it too, will buy it soon :) Still have to read more about it, but it seems to be what you're looking for.
Mage Knight might fit the bill here. Also mention Gloomhaven
 
**Gloomhaven**. Definitely get Gloomhaven, it looks to be the best dungeon crawler ever.
Dungeon Dice
I really like Mice and Mystics. 
[DungeonQuest](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/157958/dungeonquest-revised-edition) - never will you have so much fun randomly dying. Sometimes you even get treasure ;)
**Sword & Sorcery** is coming soon, as well as **Gloomhaven**.

Both look to be great dungeon crawls, but they aren't released quite yet.
You need to be more specific. Do you want a full-blown campaign? Standalone scenarios? How many players? Light or heavy weight? How about playtime? What setting?
Not Descent or DnD only just narrows it down to about a thousand different options.....
Amazon also has it as $19.99. I've seen as low as $17.49 on Amazon as well.
The problem there is "Walmart".
Walmart has Pandemic?
Good deal.  Being a relatively new board gamer, outside of the usual Monopoly etc, picked up Ticket to  Ride, Catan and Pandemic at Target a couple weeks back for a buy 2 get 1 free.  I'm getting addicted to board games now that I realize there are so many good ones out there that I had no idea existed. Have since picked up Robinson Crusoe and Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures.  I'm constantly looking for sales on games now. The only problem I have is convincing the wife and kids to play with me.
I think there are enough expansions that the deck construction aspect will keep it fresh. You can always try new options 
If you're looking into competitive, it will become stale. Any card game that doesn't get constant fresh influx of cards will unfortunately die at the FLGS level. 

However, if you're looking for playing casually then I think it's worth picking it up. That's what I did. I only seek to play it casually so I picked up the core set, some expansions and then try to do my best WAAARGH impressions. It's a very good game. 
I picked up the core set recently and I've had a blast with it. Just a fun 2-player strategy game with the different factions. I think it's one of those games I'll bring out once in while for friends. 
I'd guess glossy rather than matte.
I have a Scotch brand laminator.  I use Apache brand crystal clear finish 5mil lamination material.  I got it all from Amazon.  

I made some dashboards for Formula De that work really well with dry erase markers or grease pencils.  
I've printed a score card for end-of-game scoring in Rococo and had it laminated at Staples (that's an office supply store in the United States). First I had it printed on card stock.

It's really sturdy. 

I can mark on the card with a [Grease Pencil/ China Marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_pencil). It's pretty much a fancy crayon, but made for writing on glass and porcelain like plates and bowls, hence the name, "china marker". I could just as easily use a dry erase marker if I wanted to.

The advantage to using a grease pencil over a dry erase marker is that while it's easily erasable with a soft tissue, it won't accidentally rub of onto other game components.
I would use 5mm. It will lay flat and there is really no reason to go thicker. Plus, your average cheap laminator can handle that thickness just fine. 

But word of warning... the ink used in dry-eraser markers can easily transfer to different places and isn't always easy to remove. On something like plastic... you are good. But on cardboard, which is porous and can trap those particles, it may be difficult to remove and the components may appear dirty overtime. 

Personally, I like using plastic chips (green and red) to cover activated and unavailable milestones.

The universal love for Game of Thrones except for me always surprises me. That's certainly been a $50 decoration on the shelf. If anyone wants to trade, I'm here :D
If you think Eclipse might be too long then I think you can cross off Twilight Imperium
Sounds like **Mare Nostrum: Empires**. You would need the expansion for the 6th player tho. **Game of Thrones** also checks all the points.
**Kemet** sounds like it fits the bill. **Blood Rage** is also pretty badass. 
Maybe not Twilight Imperium. Quartermaster General perhaps.
Small World might be what you're looking for. It works well with different player counts, and there's a good deal of strategy and decision making without it being overwhelming like TI. All the games I've played have taken less than 90 mins. 

If you want something space themed and don't mind spending a lot of money, Star Trek: Ascendancy is pretty manageable. It's a 4x that needs exactly 3 players, but some expansions are coming out in the next couple months that will up the player count to 5. It's a great game and definitely worth the price, and it has much more diplomacy than Small World. Plus, its rules are pretty manageable, and it takes about 4 hours tops if everyone knows how to play.   
I love Cosmic Encounter and Twilight Imperium and recommend them in general, but in terms of those specific criteria Cosmic isn't really a wargame and Twilight Imperium takes like 4 hours minimum with only 4 players who are relatively experienced with the rules. Also I believe Small World is a bit on the light side and only plays 5 (although I'm pretty sure they have a 6th player expansion).

If you've got the budget I'd say **Kemet** for 2-5 players and **Rex** for 6. Or **Forbidden Stars** for 2-4 and **Rex** for 5-6.


Definitely worth picking up, the amount of games that people have ported in is staggering. It also just makes playing that games easier.
I have used it to play board games online with some friends when we were unable to get together in person (people moved away, etc.).  It works perfectly.  The controls may take a bit of getting used to but are pretty intuitive and fairly powerful.  And people have put in an incredible amount of effort to import the textures and everything so that you can even play a very intricate, component-heavy game like Mage Knight, by simply downloading the appropriate module from the Steam Workshop.  I understand there are many other possibilities, games with some automation and scripted events and such, but for me it was worth getting this just to be able to play games with friends online almost as though we're sitting at the same table.
Tabletop Simulator is brilliant. Very intuitive to use and is fantastic for quickly playing anything with a long setup time. Massive amount of content in the steam workshop, only the newer or more obscure games are unavailable. 

The only downside I can think of is you need friends dedicated to playing with you online (speaking of which if anyone wants to play on TTS sling me a pm and I'll add you on steam). 
I really wish they marketed the game based on how it's an awesome way to play board games online instead of *"TABLE FLIP LUUUULZZZZZZZZZZZ XDDDDDD"*.
Amazing way to try out games you're thinking of buying. My collection has grown a lot since I bought TTS. It's also helped my avoid games I was excited about, but turned out not to be as great as I thought they would be.
Thinking of picking this up.  If I did, would anyone be interested in a weekly game?  Medium to Heavy Euro  games on Thursday night @7pm est?  My husband has his DND group and I would love to be able to play some games at the same time
Hasn't it been 50% off in every single sale since its launch?
Can you play against AI with TTS or does it require you connect with real people?
Do the other players need to own the game to be able to play, or just the GM and the rest of the players get added in as kind of a JackBox situation with a passcoded room or something?
Can't wait to get Touch for Rift, this will be awesome!
Definitely worth it at that price. It's a great alternative to in person, but it can be difficult to find people to play with unless you have people you know with TS. I don't know many people with it and find it hard to find public games to play at times. 

Speaking of which, I'm always looking for new people and games to play. PM me if you're on TS and need players. 
A friend gifted it to me a while back and only a couple months ago did I really get into it. It's pretty damn great, it started as kind of a gimmicky joke app but over time it has really evolved into something pretty useful. Finding a game with randoms can be a bit laborious sometimes, the discussion on the in-game global chat can often be full of complete idiots spouting memes but in general the tool itself is good stuff.

For me at least it's amazing to play games with american friends. That and things that I would never be able to play locally because they simply are not available in my native language and so a lot of my IRL friends are right out of the question. The only downside I could see is the obvious legality issues and the whole can of worms about whether publishers are ok with it or not but speaking of online boardgames; I tried (and reviewed) Tabletopia just yesterday and that is soooo much worse than TTS it ain't even funny.

Hopefully more devs will publish their stuff officially on TTS at some point.


Been meaning to get into games and build a steam friends list. My IRL friends aren't exactly gaming friendly.

Gonna bite the bullet and buy this, but I got nobody to play it with.

My steam name is burningcouches (will edit if wrong). Pls add.
Is there some place I can see what games are available?
my brother did all the audio for this, makes me happy whenever it pops up in my feed :)
I honestly found it kind of useless.  Getting into a public game was basically impossible, and none of my friends are interested in getting it.  The interface is extremely fussy and even simple tasks felt annoying (for example, I would often accidentally pick up the entire deck or group of pieces instead of one piece at a time).   The rules aren't built into the games either, so it doesn't automate the process of learning the games or enforcing the rules.  

I guess it could be great for prototyping, or if everyone you game with wants to use it, but for me it just didn't work. 

Edit:  I should mention that even though I never seem to actually play a game with it, I don't regret buying it for $10 as I sometimes like to use it to check out the components of games I don't personally own. 
If you buy it, can you download the images of a game? So you can use them as you like, not only in the Tabletop itself.

Thank you
Still no Fief.... 
Just bought a 4 pack for some friends and I. Any good resources for learning the controls and hotkeys, or are those are learnable just through the game?
Its so great to even just looking through components of games you are thinking about buying. Just search "{name of game} + tabletop simulator + workshop" and be surprised about how someone has made a mod for it.
It's definitely worth it.

I use it mainly to check out components of games and try and get a feel for how rules work.

I also use it to solo play games I own. Best advantage is I can setup and be playing a game of Eldritch Horror in less than a minute, or play with my friend interstate.
How much are games to play on TTS?

Excellent game with a ton of replay value. Especially good at 2p. Gets lost in the shuffle of newer flashier stuff nowadays. 
Finally pulled the pin on this and **Kingdom Builder**. Prices just to hard to resist, and w/ prime I was able to get free same day delivery. Crazy. 
I love this game. I picked it up during a Target B2G1 where it net out just slightly below $35.

That being said, if this is the only game you're looking to buy, this is a good price to jump in on.

Dysania: The struggle to get up in the morning. Especially common on Mondays between August and May.

BOOP: Bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia. A serious disease with a cute name

The Mean Reds: Described by Holly Golightly as "Suddenly you're afraid but you don't know what you're afraid of."

Empirism: An awful affliction brought on by watching too much BBC; usually manifests in a British accent and a sudden craving for tea

Achy beaky heart.
Hexagonorrhea
Elves and pixies are for children

You dont deserve it because you are a terrible person

There is a nonzero chance the game was created by child labor

You could donate the money to your local humane society instead ao they can buy food for the animals (but you wont, see point two)
It's a waste of money that could otherwise be spent on Twilight Struggle or Netrunner :P.
It can be difficult to get into the atmy building aspect especially id you don't play often. If you're in experienced, sometimes the game feels like it ends pretty fast before it gets to the 'good bits'. That's all I've got though the game is pretty excellent 
C&C Ancients is much better.
It's available as an app for significantly less, can play whenever you want, and don't need anyone else.
It is a fun game, but it competes with other, better 2 player games. Rebellion, War of the Ring, Twilight Struggle
Wait, Battlelore is on sale?  [opens new browser window...]
I'm no help, I think the game is great fun for two players. 
Did you already pay for shipping on the pledge manager and then, after adding more expansions, are requested to pay additional shipping?  

I seem to remember reading that anything after the deadline would ship from the US, causing additional costs outside the country.
I know some details about this title.  It's honestly the most excited I've been about a Lovecraft title.  It sounds amazing!
My favorite Lovecraft story!! 
IELLO and ___ working together on ___.


Well, consider me interested.
I'm just excited to IELLO (who do amazing productions) doing heavier games
Woooo! Mountains of Madness is my favorite lovecraft story, and Rob Daviau is one of my favorite designers, so I can't wait for this one.
YES!
One of my family favourites is **[The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game.](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126/really-nasty-horse-racing-game)**   It has the look and feel of a classic game and therefore easy to introduce to the older generation, but the play can be very amusing, involving betting and some Take That.  It is the only Roll & Move game in my collection.  It plays best with more players so I don't think it would be suitable if you're looking for something the two of them can play by themselves.   Were you thinking two-player games?

Perhaps also consider these games with approachable themes and straightforward rules:

[Cottage Garden](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204027/cottage-garden) - tetris, tile-laying game to create a garden.

[Dream Home](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194880/dream-home) - set collection game

[Survive:  Escape from Atlantis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2653/survive-escape-atlantis) - get your meeples off the island before it sinks.  

[Timeline](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/85256/timeline-inventions) - quick card game that tests your knowledge of historical dates

Sounds to me like [Schotten Totten](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/372/schotten-totten) would be right up their alley.
If you think they'd like something like a simpler version of chess, check out Mouse Guard: Swords & Strongholds.

If you think they'd like a simple, but difficult, card game, The Game is actually pretty good, in my opinion (despite the horrendous name).

If you think they could co-operate and have half-decent memory, Beyond Baker Street gets my recommendation.

Jaipur and Patchwork are my go-to couple's games, so they're worth a look.
**Patchwork**
No Thanks would be my top choice - it's a quick card game with easy rules, quick to play, interesting strategy.

Other suggestions:

Ingenious - Tile-laying, visually pretty, interesting strategically, easy rules, scales well, should be great for people who like abstract games, 30-45 minutes to play. Recommend the better quality original edition.

10 Days in... Europe, USA, Africa, Asia, or the Americas. Be the first to create a complete travel route, there are versions for different parts of the world. Great game that plays well with 2-4, and each round is short (~20 minutes), so you can play multiple times in a row. It's about drawing and replacing cards in a rack so that you have a fully connected trip between countries. A little bit like rummy and a lot like an old game called Rack-O.

Can't Stop - Fun, fast, dice-rolling press-your-luck game.

Cartegena - Racing pirates along a path by playing path-matching cards, with a clever movement mechanism.

Guillotine - funny card game, chop off aristocrats heads during the French revolution.

I've had luck with party games like **Dixit** and **Spyfall** with my in-laws who kind of match that description.

* Shakespeare

Chess; it's a classic.
Mice and Mystics is a bit of a dungeon crawl, but it's got a narrative campaign that you play through. It's a solid game though and it's got a few expansions. 
Massive Darkness, Gloomhaven, Arcadia Quest (just because it's great, not really a traditional dungeon crawler).  I've heard good things about Shadow of Brimstone, but haven't played it.
**Space Hulk Death Angel** is a nice simple dungeon crawler that primarily uses dealing with extremely tight spaces as a mechanic.
Another suggestion (what I opted for) you might be interested in is **Inis**.
I like blood rage more than I like cry havoc, however blood rage is terrible at 2 and best at 4 
We got both in our group. My personal opinion would be that **Blood Rage** is, hands down, better than **Cry Havoc**. Don't get me wrong, CH is good game. The difference is that BR is a GREAT game. 
I'd skip **Cry Havoc**; the game isn't balanced. The humans shouldn't lose unless everyone piles on them.
Both are great, in my opinion. I've played each 3 times and really feel like you can't go wrong with either. 

Blood Rage is neat in that you can do well by having your dudes die glorious deaths. 

Cry Havoc is cool for differing factions and varying faction abilities, strengths, weaknesses, etc. 

Blood Rage really shines with 5 players, which requires an expansion. There's also few neat expansions that are definitely worth getting but maaaaybe not worth the money I see them going for. It's still a fun game with 3 and 4, though. 

I think Cry Havoc is pretty "meh" at 2 as well. 
Clockwork Wars is on sale at CSI (or was yesterday at least). It has a modular board and scales perfectly between all player counts. This is the underrated dudes on a map game that should be getting way more credit.
1) I'm not sure of the exact haunt, but I've played many games of Betrayal. The dog has no traits, and thus cannot pick up the key (if picking up the key requires trait rolls). 

However (and this depends on the haunt), if the key (once picked up) can be traded and/or dropped and picked up freely, then at that point the dog should be allowed to pick up the key and take it where it needs to go. The dog can never interact with the object though, he can only give it to another hero to do their thing.

2) The Drip tile causes one less die on any given trait roll made in the room. Since the dog doesn't make trait rolls, the drip tile will not affect the dog. 
Space Alert?
The Captain is Dead?
Battlestations, maybe?
https://www.amazon.com/Rio-Grande-Games-392RGG-Space/dp/B002ALJ9LI/ref=sr_1_61?m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1480107754&sr=1-61&refinements=p_6%3AATVPDKIKX0DER%2Cp_8%3A2229062011

If it is Space Alert, Amazon has it on sale right now.  I am not sure if it's a good price or not, but here it is.
I love Space Alert.
Thanks guys! My boyfriend figured it out; it was actually Damage Report. But Space Alert looks pretty good, so I have a lot to look into now.
Bohnanza
Your drafting games like sushi go party / 7 wonders seem good here
**Paris Connection** comes really close to what you're after. It's more subtle than what some players give it credit for though (and it may be too subtle given your interaction requirements), but it's a neat little game & it's seen a lot of usage in our circle this year (which is a group that really likes high interaction games). The variant of received stock staying in front of the screen improves the game, especially for new players.
For Sale is great
Maybe **Mysterium**? It is co-op but it's unlike any other co-op I've played: one of you is a ghost giving out hints to the identity of your murderer using oversized, full-bleed picture cards a la Dixit, while everyone else is playing a vastly superior version of Clue and trying to track down suspects. Takes about 45 minutes and plays up to seven.
**King of Tokyo**'s pretty easy to pick up and the games are short.
Codenames! The resistance Avalon.
Incan gold is meant to be great. Spyfall is also fantastic (you can play it via a free phone app).

Escape: Curse of the Temple seems up your alley. Every game is 10 minutes long, and the rules are very straightforward. 
Cosmic encounter!
Definitely, definitely check out **Mission Red Planet**. Plays 3-6 in under an hour, strategic, lots of fun and plenty of screwing people over but in pretty fun ways. 
**Between Two Cities** plays 3-7, takes like 30 minutes regardless of number of players. It's semi co-op but competitive since you have a partner to your left and one to your right as you share a city with both of them. 

You are encouraged to discuss strategies with each partner and if you see them try and play a better piece in their city they don't share with you, try and convince them to put it in your city so interaction can be high. 
Tsuro is a very easy to learn game, with a simple dynamic that scales well with 2 through 8 players. No trading or economy mechanic, but definitely options to screw people over. 
I can't recommend the expanded version Tsuro of The Seas, as it adds an infuriating random element. 
Impulse by Carl Chudyk. 
I just made my own copy of **Crossing** today to play with my nephews and really enjoyed it. It's definitely simplistic and $30 is more than I feel it's worth, but you can make your own version pretty easily. You'll have plenty of player interaction, and it works for that exact player count. Plays quick enough that the take-that moments don't leave a bitter taste, too.
Bohnanza or sheriff of Nottingham if you want negotiations. King of Tokyo for a simple dice chucker. Evolution for a thinkier interactive planning
Games I've had success with in a lunch hour at work:

**Red 7**, if you don't mind a pure card game. Fast, easy to teach, and lots of potential for over-screwing since every play is forced to be one of taking victory away from the previous player. 

**Eight-Minute Empire: Legends** (I recommend getting the Legends version, but the original 8ME is fine, too). Nice quick dudes-on-a-map game with a tiny map, lots of interaction.

**Small World**. A step up from 8ME in complexity, and harder to squeeze into an hour at the higher player counts, but lots of fun and interaction.

**Black Fleet**, for fun on the high seas as you and your fellow players each control both a merchant ship doing pick-up-and-deliver and a pirate who raids your opponents' merchants. While also taking turns controlling the navy ships that hunt the pirates down. Round and round it goes..

**Robo Rally** or **Jamaica** or **Formula D** if you want a good racing game.
* Chicago Express (fairly chaotic at 5-6p though, but very interesting)
* Paris Connection (very quick, but lots of nuance)
* Fresh Fish (only up to 5p but very good)
* King Chocolate (maybe a bit dry - but nice and subtle)
* Intrigue (filled backstabbery negotiations)
* Bohnanza (trades and dealmaking)

Then for more social style games you have

* Coup
* Resistance
* One Night Ultimate Werewolf
* Cosmic Encounter (more like 90min though)

**Coloretto** plenty of interaction based on where you put the cards. Games are 20-30 min each. Only scales to 5 (not 6) players.

*Colt Express* would fit your criteria well. 
Just played Pictomania yesterday with casuals. The rules cover most loopholes and encourages you to draw properly unlike many drawing games. Very easy to learn or teach.

Made by same designer who made codenames and space truckers.
This is one of their best Top 10 videos because they're clearly having a great time making it. I've watched so much Dice Tower content that I know their tastes and I could have probably guessed half this list, so for me now it's often just about listening to friendly faces chatting about games. Although Zee does occasionally throw in an obscure one I haven't heard of which is nice.

As for being useful, I think it is. I want to know what one euro game the guy who doesn't like euro games still enjoys, because that must say a lot about that game.

Am I the only one that thinks this is a useful list? Viewers familiar with the tastes of Tom, Zee and Sam can use this information to see if they too might like a game that normally isn't their style. This could be helpful for playing games with people with different tastes than you and finding a game you both can enjoy. 

This sub seems so negative sometimes, it just seems like the "cool" thing to do is to insult people producing resources that probably most users here have used to aid their involvement in and knowledge of the hobby (e.g. Wil Wheaton and Dice Tower). 
This video was one of the must fun videos they have done recently, I love the interactions between them.
This is the reverse of their recent list about games they thought they'd like but didn't. These are games they thought they'd dislike, but ended up liking. I liked both of those lists.
I thought this was one of the more interesting ones as you get all the outliers. 
**Battlegrounds** keeps getting crapped on by miniatures hobbyists for not having miniatures.

That seems completely backward to me.  

I don't do minis anymore because I have kids and no time/space to do it, but I will probably get back into it after a while.  Because I really like it.  I like planning the models/army/whatever, shopping for them, building them, customizing them, painting them, playing with them, learning new techniques.  So when you have a game that is excellent, maybe *better* even than Games Workshop games, but doesn't *require* thousands of dollars in minis...you're upset?  It seems like a dream scenario to me.  You get to make your entire army from scratch.

Nothing in Battlegrounds says you CAN'T play with miniatures.  Go to their forum, and you'll find people doing this regularly.  There's plenty of miniatures games wherein your squads are on little trays.  This is the same thing, except it doesn't cost you $400 and weeks of work to try out a new strategy.  It won't relegate you to playing with the 5 other people in your area that happen to be at the intersection of "insane + expendable income + free time".

People play with unpainted miniatures all the time.  There's people who won't play with their best painted minis.  So if the only thing that you're willing to do is paint(because you won't shop and model for yourself), then how can you accept a game that people play unpainted, but won't accept a game that doesn't require minis?  It doesn't make a lick of sense.  You should be happier it doesn't come with models if the modelling is your hobby.

It's an excellent game, and I'm stoked it's getting rebooted.  I hope the art is better; because that's what people are actually turned off by.  Not this "no minis" nonsense.  If FFG put it out with badass artwork and lots of marketing hype, people would call it the dawn of a new age of accessible tabletop wargames.

Is Tom mentally handicapped? because he has the temperament and opinions of a 11 year old as a hat-tipping neckbeard. 

No one posted the list? Godamnit. 
The app is excellent, but it's tough to beat a tactile board game. Get the app to try it out.
The app is the best digital version of a board game you'll ever play. It's amazing. The creators of this port deserve applause.

The board game is of course still better, just because it always is.
I have iOS version and it's really good. But I always prefer to play on the real desktop. 
The app is excellent but it does reduce it to feeling very much like a solo effort. I wouldn't use it for a group. If it's just you, then yes, well worth it.
It's addressed in the FAQ:

VIII. Endgame: Special cases
During a defeat against the Picts (or Saxons) where a 12th Siege Engine is laid
simultaneously with a 12th sword, of which a majority are white, is the game won
(because of the majority of White swords) or lost (because of the 12 Siege Engines)?

In this case the game is lost: It is lost the instant a 12th Siege Engine is laid around Camelot,
before there is even a chance for the Knights to count the White swords!
I don't think there is anything definitive in the rules to cover this, but my interpretation would be that unless something explicitly says that the quest results are resolved in order they all happen at once. Thus, the game is over and you won on one front and lost on another, so you lose (since the tie goes against the Knights).
You check the swords after completing the action, which would include resolving the effects of failing the quest. I'd say you lose due to siege engines before you win due to swords
Booze 
Playing stripthebes instead of just thebes
We always use background music. 
Reading that **Pandemic** variant just stresses me out 
Add a bit of role playing. Especially for Diplomacy and Betrayal at House on the Hill. Booze helps with this.
Word. Ditto. Amen. Happy Thanksgiving!

My wife and daughter and I are having a pajama day, and planning to eat non-traditional foods (wife is dairy-free, daughter is vegetarian), and play board games all day. 

On the menu:
* Yogurt & granola

* Power Grid

* Apple Pie (wife is making it from scratch as I type this, for 'brunch')

* Oceanos

* Islebound

* Roasted red-pepper vegan enchiladas

* Steam Time

* Pumpkin cake with maple frosting

Side dishes (maybe will play): Castles of MKL, Via Nebula, Monarch, Above and Below, Archaeology.
I'm stuck at work (since it's just ordinary Thursday here in Canada) but I express the sentiment too.  There will be some gaming this weekend.  :)  (And there was on our Thanksgiving last month.)
It's Friday here now in China and I'm at work. I bought a few games thanks to cheap international shipping fee at Amazon. Can't wait to open and play them with my wife.
Happy Holidays! 
Gobble gobble gobble!!!!!
Wewt! Have a good holiday!
thanks! hope you had a great day as well!
Mine goes in a clockwise rotation from the bottom right. It start with counting up to ace, then counts up again to ace. The next two count down again with ace being high.  The hands goes Spade, Diamond, Club, Heart, Spade, Diamond, Club, Heart.  It ends with the 2 of Hearts in the top right of the 4 center spots.
Username checks out for this type of post and reply comments
I think you answered your own question. The randomization makes it more challenging to spot moves immediately. I've only played it once myself, but recall both sides kicking themselves for missing one move or another, that was half the fun.
I would say Flash Point. 

You're a group of firefighters trying to save a building from burning down. Your group doesn't seem nervous to take it to the next level. Pandemic, a great option option as well, but I find there is less quarterbacking in Flash Point. That may be due to the mystery whether or not there is a person in a room or if fire will spread and so on. 

In contrast, Pandemic is a classic and can be very challenging. It also opens the door to Pandemic Legacy which sounds like when your group may have an itch for. It a very high stakes 12(?) round play through of Pandemic. Basically if you lose, you won't be able to play that particular board again.

Best of luck, hope that helps!

Good on you guys for getting so much play out of a small collection.

**Pandemic** is the definitive co-op - it's been hugely influential and will have been an inspiration for tons of suggestions you'll get here. (Oh, and if anyone says get **Pandemic: Legacy** first - don't. But maybe get it second. I find that the base game and expansions are very deep and it can be easy to get caught in the hype that the newer, flashier campaign is "better" when it's not that simple!)

**Mysterium** is a modern classic, too. It has a ghost who can only talk through surreal art, and everyone's working together to find out who killed them.
**Powergrid** 
**CO2** - semi cooperative game where players are against each other until the moment they need to work together so they all don't loose the game. Every player is CEO of an energy company that needs to add green plants (and stop pollution by reducing fossil fuel power plants). In order to do that you need to propose project, install project and construct power plant, while in the process other players can continue where you stopped until power plant is constructed (which means you can prepare everything for someone else even that is not your intention) (up to 4 players)  
**Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island** - highly thematic and hard game (up to 4 players)  
**Samurai Spirit** - this should accommodate up to 7 players  
**Eldritch Horror** + **Forsaken Lore expansion** - I think this goes up to 8 players
**Pandemic** is the classic co-op game, but *only plays up to 4*.

I would recommend either **Flash Point** or **Hanabi** based on the games you've played.
Mm, i'd highly recommend Dead of Winter, it's not a game you can continuously keep playing, but it adds a nice depth between those super long 4+ hour games and the 1 hour games. A group of survivors are trying to survive from a zombie apocalypse and needs to work together to complete the main objective, but be wary of a possible traitor in your midsts.  Though if I recall, DoW is a 5 player game.
        
I'd also suggest, carcassonne which is a GREAT game with a lot of replay value. You are building the board and trying to score the amount of points, but be careful as your friends will also try to develop their own paths and maybe hinder you as well! (Not a co-op game)
         
Pandemic itself is only a 4 player game, so it is NOT ideal unless you really only have 4 players. 
     
Eldritch Horror is a great game, BUT setting up is an extreme pain (consider 30-60 minutes) and if your friends are not looking into 4+ hour games, this is not your cup of tea. 
        

Maybe an area control game is a good next choice. Kemet or Cyclades.
Europe 
> What Is The Best Version of Ticket to Ride?

Oh, is that what we're gonna do today?  We're gonna fight?

**TTR: Europe**

You don't have to play with Train stations, Ferries and Tunnels when teaching new players and there is a lot more room to grow than with Vanilla TTR.

It's also cheaper when you factor in the cost of the 1910 expansion which is necessary with the base game.

I would suggest the original with 1910 for the better cards, or Europe.  I have heard Nordic is best of playing with only two.
My family has almost every version of Ticket to Ride, and we mostly play Europe and India/Switzerland
Ticket to Ride: Märklin by a good bit...
Original board with 1910 is always fun. I usually default to this if I want to play something that has a minimal amount of setup, but is still a thinking game.

For 4 or less, India is a lot of fun. You get routes that aren't obvious AND you don't know where anything is!

UK is interesting where they add a tech tree and visas. I haven't had an opportunity to play the Pennsylvania board yet, but the stocks seem interesting.
Um, hands down **UK/Pennsylvania**. Adds enough complexity to the base game to keep it interesting, but not too much. Gives you the option of both boards in a single expansion each with a different flavor depending on your group. 

Europe is a close second with Switzerland and Nordic coming in behind. 
For 2, Switzerland is just a terrific 2-player game.  It gets old once you've played it 20-30 times, but by then you've played it 20-30 times.

Marklin is my favorite for multiple players.  The map is tight and mean, and the passengers provide a really interesting thing to fight over.
Vanilla + 1910
In my experience, I think TtR's best purpose is to introduce gaming to people. And in that regard, I believe the best version is the base with 1910. It has the least amount of rules and the most familiar map (at least to Americans). People will say how there's some imbalance to the map or whatever, but if you are playing with new players, that really doesn't matter. What matters is having a fun experience with a game that is easy to learn and nice to look at.

I also have high opinions of Nordic Countries. This is a very challenging map and is the hardest of the series. It only plays from 2-3, but it is very exciting and tense. This is great for people who are used to the TtR series and want to test their skills.

So that's my pick for the two I enjoyed the most. Original TtR is there for grabbing new players into the hobby and showing them a good time. Nordic is my preferred way to play because it's probably the most skill-intensive and competitive.

With that said, my go-to game for new players is still Splendor. And as far as playing with other gamers go, it depends on the people.
**Viticulture** sounds like a good idea for you. It's from Stegmaier Games just like **Scythe**. It has a simmilar vibe and art design yet beeing a completely different game at the same time. It's a worker placement euro where you make wine in your own winery. Just be sure to get the Essential Edition.
**Shakespeare** - Thematically every player runs a theater, hires actors, do rehearsals and tries to make best show.   
Mechanically there is blind bidding which determines number of actions for turn as well as players order, low scores, need to pay actors at the end or loose points, use characters on one turn but rest on other, make dresses or build set, etc.  
Really good game.
I'll introduce you to a classic game of mine, **Hansa Teutonica**. i fell in love with it the first time i played. If not for the dry as drab theme i would have less issues letting it make it to the table. (my friends prefers a little theme)
Keyflower. Just get Keyflower.
If you like elaborate designs and deep euro gameplay, try **The Gallerist** or **Lisboa**.
Games don't necessary need to be "complicated" or "heavy" to have fun. The most games you mention (almost all) are not that casual. And a lot of worker placements. I would suggest getting some more casual games to have fun with and you'll get more games to the table as well. Suggestions:

* Codesnames
* Ticket to Ride
* Survive: Escape from Atlantis
* Mysterium
* Galaxy Trucker
* Tales of Arabian Nights
* Dixit
* Forbidden Desert
* Sushi Go
* Machi Koro
* Kemet (just because it's that good and you don't have direct conflict war games :) )
Holy shit, red planet marked down from 34.87 to 34.86. GUYS THIS IS THE DEAL WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR! 
This is... a sale? Imperial Assault is $72ish, even though I saw it in the $50-60 range just a day or two ago.

Kinda lame :/
Remember to check http://www.camelcamelcamel.com for amazon price histories.
Are any of these deals? Look like pretty normal Amazon prices to me...
Might want to mention this is Amazon US only...

US people have a tendency to act there is only the US..

**STOP POSTING YOUR SHITTY AFFILIATE LINKS EVERYWHERE**

I played Mombasa the other day for the first time and it immediately became a top 5 game for me.  Was absolutely obsessed with it.  That makes me even more excited for this one which is currently being shipped to me.  If this game turns out to be something I love like Mombasa he's going to become one of my favorite designers. 
Great review. The depth in this game is what drew me to it, after watching a playthrough. Delivering cows to Kansas seems like the most important thing, but you don't actually (directly) score any points for doing it. I'll be playing my second game tomorrow night, I really can't wait to dive in again.
I hope the game would be produced in another style of artwork :/
I just picked up a copy for us yesterday, but we haven't gotten a play in.  Perhaps this weekend.  It definitely looks interesting.
What version of Mombasa is that - some sort of special edition?
Decent enough game, but after 3 games all took well over 3 hours each, not even including teaching time - I decided it was just too long a game for me.  
Lost me at "you score points". Sick of counting VPs on a pad. It's not hard to do something more interesting, this is just lazy.
The BIGGGG news for me is that Ricky Royal of Box of Delights designed a cyberpunk hacker game (!!!!!!!!!!!)

My list of priorities for 2017:

A Handful of Stars

Alien Artifacts

Tiny Epic Quest

Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black

In the Year of the Dragon 10th Anniversary Edition
They're making a Warehouse 13 board game? Now? How long has the show been off the air? If it still had a huge following like Firefly does I could understand, but it doesn't, at least not that I know of.
I despise that website's layout.
Fields of Despair is on here! Hurray!
Agricola Big Box would have been at the top of my list. Shame it is getting pushed back. 
The 7th Continent seems interesting. 

No Agricola?
Race / Roll for the galaxy should be getting some new expansions each. Plus "Jump Drive" and a RFTG Board Game.

Edit: Spooling
I may get a lot of flack for this, but am I the only one that thinks that most anticipated x in any form of awards is kind of silly? 
I highly recommend **Hide The Tubesteak**. Generally played with 2, but sometimes expanded to 3 with open-minded gamers. Turns into a legacy title if you don't take appropriate precautions!
...and then we held hands

100 Swords

Jaipur

Ascension: Apprentice Edition

Patchwork

One Zero One

Mouse Guard: Swords and Strongholds

Pandemic: The Cure (put it all in the draw bag)

Hive Pocket
I have three suggestions!

**Love Letter** -- how can I not recommend this on a honeymoon!  Extremely portable, especially the version that you only need a pouch/bag for. It's a bluffing and deduction game. Quick rounds, lots of fun. 

**Schotten Totten** -- Extremely portable two player game.  Feels a lot like playing 9 games of poker and therefore also has bluffing involved. 

**Lost Cities** -- also portable but has the least portable box of these three. Great Reiner Knizia game. Feels like rummy or poker. 

Have a great Honeymoon and congrats!
Hive Pocket
"I keep getting lick foot. I think these dice are broken."
**Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective** might be good if you are driving. I spent a lot of time trying to find good games for couples for road trips and this one seemed to come out on top since one person can still play even while driving. It's not necessarily small box-size-wise though. Also, if you're interested in this you might also want to check out **Mythos Tales** which copies the format but changes the theme (and I've heard is better).

I can also recommend **Paperback** as a mix between deckbuilding and scrabble, two things that my own wife happens to like. It's just a bunch of cards so the box is pretty small.

Lastly you might want to check out any of the **Tiny Epic**- series of games whose whole claim to fame are small box sizes.
Get **...and then we held hands** and thank me later. It's the perfect 2 player game for couples. My fiance and I love it.
**The Ravens of Thri Sahashri**

Really small box so its super portable. Downside is they are tarot sized cards so require a good bit of room when actually playing.
My husband and I brought Dutch blitz and race for the galaxy (cards only, kept track of VP on paper). We also brought lords of Waterdeep, but that's only because we had room in the suitcase. 
**Fairytale** . Congrats! but do you need to take any ? 

edit: This is a drafting game that is super small and  works well with 2 people.
Greed-My wife and I played this at least a dozen times on our honeymoon. 
My wife and I are avid traveller's and have ran into this same scenario. While the following are not "board games", they are fun either way.

* Cribbage - classic card game with a small (usually wood) board for keeping score.

* Phase 10 - easy, works fairly well with 2. Fun to add new friends to the game.

* Checkers - we have a bandana that doubles as a board. Than we just use random objects as the pieces

* Fluxx - a fun card game, always different. Easy to play with 2

I know these aren't what you were intending... But I hope they help. Where are you going on your honeymoon? 
+1 for Patchwork
**Patchwork** - lovelly game, grab a couple of packs of mix-pattern buttons from amazon for a couple of £ to replace the cardboard ones.

**7 Wonders Duel** we both love playing this, quick, deep.

**Oh my goods** tiny box, big game.

**Jaipur** Possibly still the best 2 player game we own.

**Gloom** if you like story telling.

**Mr Jack Pocket**

/u/r2d8 getinfo
Look for the Tiny Epic Series (specially Galaxies), Patchwork, Oh My Goods! / Game of Trains, Love Letter
Hive pocket 
* Onitama - the box is unfortunately bigger than it needs to be, but it's portable and great fun.
Going to mention **Red 7** as I don't think anyone else has yet.

I'll second **Fluxx** too - pick the variant/flavour/edition that appeals to you most.
**Viticultre** is an excellent next step worker placement game.

**Navegador** was just reprinted and is an excellent, interactive, economic euro game for 2-5 players.  Featuring the same mechanics and highly interactive as well is **Antike II** from the same designer.  It's a euro civ game for 3-6 players.

**Rococo** is a great hand building, area control game for 2-5 players.  Some people get hung up on the the dress making theme but those people are missing out an a very elegant, engaging game.


Any other favorites so far? Eldritch and Lords of Waterdeep are quite different so any other info might help narrow something down.
Aggressive?
Co-op?
Themes matter?
Lords of Waterdeep is much better with Scoundrels of SKullport expansion (not sure if you have or not).
Roll or Race for the Galaxy are both great, Roll is easier to learn and always fun to roll a bunch of dice but Race has more depth. 

Blood Rage is very good, depends if your group likes area control and conflict in a game. 

Some other suggestions to look into for a little heavier games than the ones you've mentioned: Concordia, Puerto Rico, El Grande, Kemet, Caylus.
* **Keyflower**
* **Istanbul**
* **Snowdonia**
* **Concordia**
Do you mind "serious" economic games or do you want stuff with combat and pretty art? 
I really, really, really think you should get **Concordia**. Pay no attention to the hideous box art, the game itself is beautiful. 
If you go to boardgamegeek, you can filter by players, rating AND weight. Maybe do this, have a look around and then come back with some suggestions.

Interesting question, but I think it would be helpful to clean up some of your terminology. Scythe isn't worker placement at all--worker placement games feature action drafting, where available actions are blocked off by players as they're chosen. Calling Viticulture non-competitive is also a little disingenuous, because it is indeed a competitive game. You may be saying it's not as tight as a game like Agricola, but competition for spots in a 2p game can still be pretty intense. 

You might get better responses if you asked whether people preferred tight worker placement games--Agricola's resource spaces are scarce and highly contested, while games like Fields of Arle and A Feast for Odin have a ridiculous number of available action spaces, lessening he conflict over key actions. 

And to contribute to the discussion, I think Agricola and Le Havre both do tight worker placement very well. There are a ton of actions in Le Havre, but a key few get fought over quite often. A Feast for Odin is my favorite wife-open worker placement game. Due to how open it is, the solo game feels quite similar to the multiplayer experience, but it's great alone or with others.
Tight/competitive - that's my style. I like the type of WP game that feels like musical chairs: always having fewer available actions or resources than everyone wants.
At the onset of learning a game, if it's loose worker placement, I always think "jeez, this isn't going to be very fun."

But then I get surprised and really like it.  Case in point Viticulture.

I guess in my mind I'm worried that the game will be too easy if other players aren't blocking you.  But there are all sorts of methods the designers use to make games hard.
I can only assume that you're playing **A Feast for Odin** with people who are trying to get high scores, not to win.
I don't understand the question.
I wanna say you start with 3 each, but it's been a while. Could be 5.
And per turn is determined by position on the score chart I think 
That guy got banned from MWO for trying to profit from the IP and copyright of not just Mechwarrior Online, but Topps as well.  There is so much wrong with selling what he's done, so much legal trouble he'd be in for if the lawyers decide he's worth their time.
I really think this game sucks :( About a million other midweight euros I'd rather play. 

I'm apparently in the minority there though. 
Fantastic game!  I really like it.  
I put in order in for this game for 60 bucks, so yeah
It's worth it in my opinion.

The Deluxe version isn't a new version -- it was the Kickstarter version that had some upgraded components. The last of those were sold off at GenCon 2016, and TMG has said they won't be re-printed.
You lucky son of a...I really wish I could get Orleans for that price.  Really great game; will probably end up dishing out $60.
My favourite non-traditional trick-taking game has been **Diamonds**. It's exactly like a traditional game, but throwing off lead suit benefits you. I also like **Chronicle**, it's a nice change having card abilities that affect the play.
Another vote for **Diamonds.** It's been a huge hit with friends and family members. You always get something even if you don't have the "best" cards, and not winning tricks can be a viable strategy. 
Have a look at **Wizard**. It's a commercial variant of Oh Hell (which is also a good trick taking game with a standard deck).

It includes two ranks that are unique. The first Wizard played always wins and the first Jester played always loses. 

Why would you want to lose a trick? Because at the beginning of each hand you have to bid on how many tricks you'll take. Wizards and Jesters give you more ways to take or give up the lead.

We've played this for years. It's the only game I own that I've rebought because it was too worn to play. It's easy to teach and is always a hit with groups we've introduced it to.
I grew up playing trick taking games, mostly euchre. It really becomes a question of weather you want a partnership game or not. 

Partnership trick taking games are my favorite but they are generally also the hardest to get people to play. People feel like they're letting their partner down all the time. Usually because they are. Great partnership games include euchre and bridge. Both are playable with a normal deck and would be how I'd start if you're unsure if you'll enjoy it. 

Tichu is also played primarily as partners but it's a ladder climbing game which is similar but different. It's less about tricks and more about emptying your hand. Some cards are worth points as well. I would recommend trying a few others first than diving into tichu.

Independent trick taking games are a better place to start in my opinion. It lets everyone sink or swim which will make them understand when to play off on a trick and save their strength and when to go hot. Learning to value your hand currently is so important to any trick taking game with bidding that I'd recommend wizard as your first. Other great ones are clubs and diamonds. 

I haven't played them but I've also heard good things about haggis, the dwarf king and nyet.  
Tichu is a ladder game and Chronicle is quite good. I would recommend looking at Honshu and Eternity, both new games this year. I also really like 5 Cucumbers and Diamonds.
**Honshu** for the trick taking is only one part of the game. It *could* be described as **Carcassonne** with trick taking to decide player order

**Nyet!** otherwise. You have changing rules of the trick (decided by players) and changing partnerships each round (decided by player one). The choices people make on rules of the trick should inform which partner you want to pick
I'm a huge fan of the classic, **Euchre**. Another one that looks really cool is **Take the A Chord**, though it's quite new and I haven't played it.
Trick of the Rails
[Kaiser](https://www.pagat.com/pointtrk/kaiser.html) is a really popular card game here on the prairies.  It's typically played a lot at parties, and in teams of two.  Very fun game, with simple rules.
Looks like a custom Abalone board maybe?
It's 2-player Chinese Checkers. The board layouts aren't standardized in any way.

Maybe **Dominion** or some other deckbuilder?
Have you considered Cosmic Encounter?
This game doesn't get talked about enough. It's pretty brief, has a load of choices, interesting worker placement mechanism, and it's got a little sliding elevator. Pretty easy to teach but I think a lot of depth and replay value as well.
I'm interested because it's from Hong Kong. Is there any video or playtest happening?
For anyone who's interested in the game, here's the [Rulebook](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByQ0D8AgSbliMUY2SkZyOVBDYWM).
Roll for the Galaxy isn't as hard to learn as Race, but Race is honestly not that difficult either. The player reference sheets are there for a reason. Once you get a few games down it becomes second nature. Can't go wrong with Roll though. It's such a smooth game and plays really quickly.

Haven't played Seasons at all but Roll isn't very comparable to Castles of Burgundy. They're just completely different games. In Burgundy, you're maneuvering around your opponent(s) to interfere with them as much as possible while making sure you get what you need, whereas in Roll all you can do to interact with your opponent is potentially enable actions for them to use while you try to piggyback off of their moves (or end the game). You also roll a bunch of dice and get potentially dozens of actions per "turn", whereas in CoB you only get 2 (plus bonuses). Roll can also be really punishing if you can't read the moves of other players but is still overall more forgiving and light than CoB. I really recommend watching Rahdo's videos on Roll because it's hard to explain the differences without showing them.
Are you sure Race for the Galaxy won't work? It's quite a bit easier to learn than Seasons and *way* faster, and it's *such* a good 2-player game. It's my go-to game with my mother. Try playing with open hands your first time, you can be finished teaching in half an hour or less.

There really aren't that many similar games that are good 2P. Roll for the Galaxy, for instance, is better at 3-4 player, rather than with the dummy player.
I've played both, if you count the digital version of San Juan. I like both, honestly. I am considering buying the San Juan physical version as well. They are pretty similar, but Roll has tons of little dice, plastic cups, and a bag full of tiles. It's a little most in-depth, but not by much. Would she like it? Hard to say.

I kinda want to suggest something a little different, if that's OK... Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy. It's a little bit of worker-placement, and a little bit of tableau-building, in a way, as you build out your family tree. It has more depth than Roll, in my opinion, because you get secret objectives and you can earn points in a lot of ways. I dunno, my wife just really likes it and so do I. Love it, even. If I have to pick to play between Roll and Legacy, I go with Legacy, as long as it's just the two of us. My table can't fit more than 2 players for Legacy (smallish table). Family trees take up a lot of room!
My go to games for dice allocation are **Marco Polo** and **Grand Austria Hotel**. However there is some iconography in both of them, especially GAH. Not as bad as Race though and most of the icons are intuitive.
CoB is a fantastic game that is easy to learn, hard to master. Highly recommend it.
Why is she meh on San Juan? Just because it seemed light?

San Juan seems really light on the first couple plays but there is still plenty of strategy that can be explored with subsequent plays. I was pretty meh on it as well but I like it more as I've played it a bit more. The lightness may stem from it having few mechanics and simple scoring, but that doesn't mean there's not tactical and strategic depth. Depending on what cards you get early in the game there are several different strategies you can go for. 

Roll is centered around the dice assignment mechanism, which I think is really interesting. Other than that it's a lot like San Juan. There is actually more variation in building abilities in San Juan, which lends its self to being able to do multiple small strategies, where Roll's tiles are mostly about either dice assignment abilities or having one of the fewer main long term strategies. 

I'm glad I have both though. I really like these simultaneous action games. It keeps everyone engaged, because you can do something on everyone else's turn.
I haven't played Race, but I absolutely love **Roll**, and moving from San Juan actually helps learn Roll considerably, because they share the same phase-centric gameplay. Only thing to know about Roll walking in is that there's nearly zero player interaction, but if you enjoy building engines and just trying to build something better than your opponents fastest, I can't think of anything better. 
San Juan is easier to learn. There are tiles to grab when you choose one of the roles. Other than the cards-as-money concept, I think it's pretty straightforward to learn.

There is one special rule to remember for a two-player game - one player gets two picks per round.

I like Race and Roll as well, but I think San Juan works well because the learning curve for the mechanisms is less steep, and you can concentrate more on strategies while playing.

It's also a lot cheaper. :-)
If the choice is between Roll for the Galaxy and San Juan definitely go for Roll.
Battlelore 2e is a phenomenal game. I believe it's different enough to include among other C&C games. As much as I love memoir 44, some of the mechanics seem a bit clunky after battlelore.

The setup time isn't as bad as you think. I'd use the premade armies for a bit until you get used to the units. After you know the units, it doesn't take much longer to setup than memoir.

I can't say much about BoW. I've only tried it once and I didn't like it as much.
If you didn't realize, BattleLore 2ed is almost certainly discontinued now due to Rune Wars the miniatures game. Fantasy Flight had everything discounted about 70% off on their sales site.
If you really like C&C, I don't see why not. Those games are fairly different from each other as far as C&C titles go (I don't consider BoW to be a real C&C game for many reasons and I also don't care for it).

I have several C&C titles and my only regret is going too heavy on expansions for some of them (Memoir especially). Looking back, I'd rather have spent the money on different C&C base games, as the base games tend to have more content than expansions do.
The chart should be in the back of the rules book for the expansion.

If that isn't the case, I'd be returning it to your place of purchase for a refund.
The chart isn't in the back of the rules book, as far as I'm aware. It's actually in the smaller, two-page booklet that starts off with the creator's letter to the consumer. That same booklet also lists the new rules, such as what tiles go on the roof.
Pm me if you can't find it in the rulebook and i'll take a picture of mine and send it to you right afterwards.
I [posted one](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3253038/betrayal-house-hill-widows-walk) a bit ago on BGG.
Nice collection!
Nice collection, what are your favorite games? Which ones are on the chopping block and why?
There aren't a ton of games that have that type of range for a player count,  but **7 Wonders** scales very well from 2-7 players. It's not co-op, but it's one of the most fun drafting games out there. If you like co-op games like The Grizzled (good luck, tough game!) more, you might like things like **Forbidden Desert** (2-5 players) or **Space Alert** (best with 4 or 5 players), which are both co-op games I've had lots of fun with. 

Hope you get what you want for the holidays!
Heads up **Gears of War** is out of print so it may be difficult to find a reasonably priced copy. 
**Bohnanza** grow some beans 2-7 plays in about an hour
Easiest to pick up: **Hanabi**, **Alhambra**, **Camel Up**

High player count: **7 Wonders**, **Samurai Spirit**
Go on to Board Game Geek, look up the game, go to the Files section and download the errata for cases 3 and 6.
Yeah, your copy will have some print issues. Translation errors, typos that change the meaning, some missing text in one case, and one or two cases where some changes resulted in some crazy inconsistencies. 

Luckily, this amazing post on BGG will tell you, with minimal spoilers, what to do before you start each case so you won't have any problems. https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1303887/irregular-handbook-complete-guide-sherlock-holmes
[Suspicion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204886/suspicion)- the target exclusive perhaps?
Mystery Express?
It's not fist of dragon stones is it? I don't remember that game having deduction but it sounds close
My main issue with heavier euro games specifically is that they seem generally to be complexity for complexity's sake. I don't mind a complex game. I enjoy wargames from chits to blocks to miniatures which on averages are more complex than heavy euro games. When euro games get their hands on complexity it *generally* is done by taking an decision path that could've been quite short and stretching it out for no reason. Instead of just getting wood you have to get fish which you convert to smoked fish which you trade for wood. I'm not a fan of games which inflate the time and overhead of how you play for no reason. I want that complexity to be there for a reason. Wargames can be guilty of this as well but i find it's generally better justified there. 

I also generally don't find what i find to be the biggest genres of heavy euro interesting. Economics is fine but not fun for me, and resource gathering and converting is fine when you are getting resources and using them (Belfort, scoville, Lords of waterdeep) but when you add like three extra steps for no reason I'm not interested. Those steps generally aren't interesting at all. 

As someone who has designed games professionally and as a hobby i guess i just know what i like. I think many heavy euros would be better games if they were medium weight and removed the filler actions. I subscribe to the less is more design philosophy that a game is good when there is nothing left to take away. 

But people like them. That's cool. I just generally don't get a half chub from heavy euros. 
I have a series of long games, time generally isn't a big problem until we hit 5hrs. My gripe is there better be a solid pay off for that time that gives me a reason for all that time. For example, **Liberte** accomplishes the same thing in terms of objective and similar calculations as **The King is Dead** but takes *5x as long...* (Hence I love TKiD and traded away Liberte)
For me, heavy games have two problems:

One, **Theme**. Heavy games tend to have pretty dry themes. I know some people don't mind and that's fine. I, though, like to play cool crazy themes. Tending a farm doesn't really inspire me, so I'm less willing to put up with whatever else the game has to offer.

Two, **Complexity**. There's a difference between "meaningful choices" and "tons of information". Again, personal taste, but I actually prefer making meaningful choices with limited information, trying to come up with ways to deal with problems I can't completely predict. "Risk Management", if you will. When the game just throws a lot of information against me and expects me to plan three turns ahead, I get overwhelmed.


So, maybe some of your friends feel like I do. Ask them about that. Maybe more theme would help them deal with the added rules. I know it works for me.
I love heavy games for the difficult decisions they force you to make. A light game might be fine for 30-45 minutes while we wait for people to arrive but a good 2+ hour meaty game is what I go out for.

The only qualities one needs to like heavy games is to be up for a challenge, even after a hard-day's work. Unless I'm tired from work *and* sick, I still like to fight for my fun.

My favorites: **Age of Steam** (rules are lighter that many medium-weight games, it's the player interaction that makes this one heavy), **The Great Zimbabwe**, likely **Food Chain Magnate** soon (I just finished up my solo play to learn the rules and there's just so much I want to try...), **Age of Industry**, **Keyflower**, **Falling Sky**, **1846**, **Power Grid deluxe**, and to edge people closer to the hard side: **Peloponnes** a medium-weight game with a bit of bite.
I used to like heavier, more complex games for their intricate, beautuful designs and the way you are able to use different strategies, find cool combinations of actions and lack of luck (for the most part).  

Nowadays I usually stay away from these types of games, because they feel like work for me. I have the tendency to try and optimize as much as possible. In games where you get more and more options every turn this can easily lead to AP and brain overload. Also sometimes, after making my turn, I notice that I overlooked something and then I get frustratred for not playing optimally. 
These games also tend to take a long time to play and teach. 
So my overall enjoyment of heavy games is a lot lower than medium complex games. 
Something like Mombasa is probably the most complex I want to play. 
For the reasons mentioned above I didn't enjoy playing Panamax, Le Havre, Caverna, Tzolkin, Alchemists, Kanban etc. as much as I should. I can recognize these are great games, but I don't want to play them.

I like heavier games because I feel more of a sense of accomplishment and fulfilment after having played them. If I've got two or three hours (which doesn't happen often these days, thanks to a new young child!) I'd usually rather fill that up with one big endeavour than four or five smaller ones. It's a special occasion when I get to pull out Roads & Boats or Vinhos, but I really look forward to those games, and I remember them much more vividly than I recall the dozens of plays of Arboretum or No Thanks, which are great games, but not nearly as memorable.

Perhaps this is because heavier games tend to try to build more theme through their mechanics than a lighter game, which tends to focus more on the puzzle, and overlay a simple pasted on theme. Vinhos is definitely not a pasted on theme... there's a lot going on in that game that simulates the wine-making industry. 




I like Heavy games that combine a simple choice with high impact

**Brass** - discard a card to perform an action, around 50% of the time whats on the card doesn't matter but by doing so you're giving up future possibilities on what actions you can take that need the cards

**Tzolk'in** do I place workers or remove workers?

What I don't like is complexity in the rule set. I don't want to read 17 pages of rules to be able to play the game (note: glossaries of actions are fine as you can use them to clarify during the game)
Heavy games are the best. Light games often tend to feel like a sprint, it's over quickly and you don't really feel like you accomplished anything. Heavier games are endurance games and make you feel like you've achieved something at the end of it. If you mess up at the beginning, it's impossible to come back in many light games (or they add catch up mechanics that make it too easy to come back). In heavier games, you can mess up, but you can potentially come back, other people might make a few mistakes as well.

List of heavy games I've played and enjoyed: Twilight Struggle, Paths of Glory, Cry Havoc, War of the Ring, Through the Ages, Twilight Imperium 3, Churchill, Genesis: Empires and Kingdoms of the Ancient Middle East.
It's all relative too. Yesterday playing codenames with a non gaming group was almost too much. One player was of the 'hurry up! Come on come on' type, the instant the other teams codegiving turn started. Zero patience. I had brought Avalon too, and I knew it would actually be more succesful with them, but I also knew there wasn't a chance I hell they would have the patience to learn how to play. That happens often. "I pretty sure you'd like this game if you understood how to play, but im pretty sure you wont have The patience to learn how to play".  And a caveat- I can't stand playing with "hurry up hurry up!" Players. I'd rather play with AP than anti-AP rushers, I know I'm I the minority on that one. 
I cannot stand light games. 

If a game does not command my *entire* attention, it does not help remove stress from my mind, and I am still stuck "at work" or still partially thinking about other things going on in life. I *especially* cannot stand playing light games with people who far exceed their expected playtime by trying to math them to death, or otherwise overthink them. (Codenames is fine with the timer, without it's torture).

>However, I've noticed that I have some friends that tune out during these games or look bored, even during the rules explanation

This doesn't mean they don't enjoy that weight of the game. That can be they don't learn games from auditory rules explanations, and would do better with a player aid or sample round. Other people play games to *win* not to *play* and dislike new complex games they can't immediately see how to win in. 

>  even enjoy learning the game and seeing it all come together. I see a complex game board and I can't wait to figure out what the hell everything means

This pleasurable rush of discovery is a trait of ADD people btw. Not saying you are, but you may find people who have similar feelings there are easier partners in your complex gaming.
In addition to other reasons cited here, I just like imperfect information and yes, randomness.
I like heavy games for a variety of reasons, but I think one of the main ones is they last long enough to get invested. With a lot of games by the time things get really interesting the game is 15 minutes away from being over anyway. With Twilight Imperium once everyone has finished the initial expansion and started working down the tech tree things are just getting started. Although that being said sometimes it's nice to play something you don't have to think as hard about, especially if you want to play multiple games in the evening.
They're also doing "Buy One Get One Half Off" on all of their boardgames...


Their selection continues to improve so it's a good chance to pick up some staples that you might not have.
Barnes and Noble in my area is also running a 40% off white dot sale which includes all boardgames. Don't know if you can combine them or if all stores will have the white dot.

Hmmm....Dead of Winter for $31.47. That's pretty tempting.
Got emails too. 

Got the 30% black friday. I have 15% coupon from back in the day just for being a member. Also got 10% everything for being a member. 

On top of that - 50$ in gift cards gets you a free 10$ (but I believe it can't be used til later so pay attention).

Hopefully I can find something. Oddly I'm not really craving anything... maybe a random worker placement. I need a "different" type of game from the stuff I have. 
Well, depending on the number of expansions you have for the LCGs and miniature games this can be a very impressive collection. :)

What's your favorite game?

You think Arkham Horror and Lord of the Rings are different enough to keep both?


I work at a FLGS too. If I had people to play with on the regular I would own more games. As it stands I only own Takenoko.

I do get to take demo games when ever I want too though. 

I'm probably going to buy Betrayal soon. Just so I can have it.
How do you like **Raptor**?
I like Mexican train a lot, but I don't know if that counts as a traditional domino game. 
My family has been playing Chicken Foot (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_foot_(game)) for years.

EDIT: Reddit can't handle links with parentheses apparently.
**42**! 

42 is my favorite game to play bar none. No amount of fancy cardboard and clever mechanics can beat a game of 42 with three other friends and a pitcher of beer. It's a trick-taking game with partners where each domino that's a multiple of five adds extra points. 

Here's the rules: http://www.domino-games.com/domino-rules/texas-42-rules.html

This game looks so much fun to me... and i'm not invested in the Android universe at all.
Got a chance to play this at BGG.CON last week and loved it. All my favorite parts of BSG but more interaction, felt faster moving, and a little more... intense?

It was great
A minimum of 4 players? Sad face.
Why does Weyland have no CEO?  I'd thought that Jack Weyland would be their CEO?
How many cores do I need to buy and will it be any good without expansions?
I was thinking that a Choas in the Old World re-theme would be good for Android universe. This is better than that :)
Every time I find something out about this game I wanted it more and more. Now I am positive I will get it but I am still bummed it's a minimum of 4
Tried this at BGG con.  I really like the Android universe but I am not a fan of BSG so this didnt appeal to me.
OK this game reads like you need to know the backstory of the universe.  I'm not into A:NR, is there something I can read to get into this?
Too many cards with unique powers. I just can't enjoy a game if I have to sit down and memorise the content of several decks before I want to be competitive. 
Anyone read this? Is it better than Feudum?
How many people are you playing with? I love the robber, tanner, troublemaker, seer, both werewolfs, the hunter, and the drunk
So when you're designing a game of ONUW the goal is usually to balance mechanics. Try to never include enough wolves so that 50% or more of the table could be wolves at a time, just under that is usually perfect if possible.
Next, you're balancing roles that create chaos and roles that provide information, and most roles fall somewhere on the spectrum between those two. 

Chaos: Troublemaker is the biggest chaos card since the end result is that nobody really know quite what happened and they go relatively late in the night. By swapping two other players you're extremely likely to mess up pretty much everyone else's understanding ot affairs. Then Drunk, less troublesome because they only disrupt their own circumstances instead of 2 other players.

Robber is pretty much exactly in the middle since they create one change but also reveal one role. Maybe a slight bias to chaos since they won't necessarily share what they know (self preservation and what not)

Information: Seer is effectively the opposite of Troublemaker, pure information, Insomniac is the opposite of Drunk.
Everything else provides interesting tweaks to the discussion dynamics, and serve to bias the game one way or another:

Tanner: bias towards wolves - makes it harder to determine why a player is behaving strangely

Hunter: bias towards Villagers - reduces the number of possible incorrect choices. Kill him, get a second chance.

Minion: bias towards wolves - obvious reasons. Can be swapped for a wolf if villagers are struggling or used to augment them if they are.

Masons: bias towards Villagers - slightly more information

Doppleganger - Wild Card, don't use until everyone understands all the roles, then use frequently.

So, possible options:

5p: 2 Wolves, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker

6p: 2 Wolves, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Tanner

7p: 2 Wolves+Minion, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, *any* (this should be pretty balanced)

8p: 2 Wolves+Minion, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Tanner, Insomniac

9p: 2 Wolves+Minion, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Tanner, Masons

10p:2 Wolves+Minion, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Tanner, Drunk, Insomniac, Hunter
I would say : throw away the villagers, Throw in everything else. I

t might take 1-2 games for everyone to understand their roles, especially the more complicated ones. But the games are short so you can afford a few games where the werewolves straight up win before everyone groks what is going on. 
First of all, relax. There is an insane amount of games out there and yes, it can be worrying that you might be making the wrong choices. For this reason I'm going to tell you, at least for now, to ignore Kickstarter. I'm a huge fan of Kickstarter, but I think out of the games I've backed, only around 50% of them have actually been worth it.  
Next, go with what you know. Zombicide, Mansions of Madness? You enjoy them, you get them. Arrange an afternoon with your friends and play through the games. See what they like, and what you all enjoy about the games. Don't over analyze, just stick with the basics.  
I would for now suggest avoiding Dark Souls. It looks awesome, but right now it seems like they're still designing the game as they go, which is worrying. That's before taking into account the fact that it's a large financial commitment before expansions. Doom on the other hand... I'm looking forward to it as I don't mind the GM aspect and like yourself, enjoyed the game. The original Doom board game was also the first board game I really wanted so I've got a little bit of nostalgia for it. It's also apparently similar in style to Descent, so this might not be for you.  
If it helps, there are a lot of games that have similar, Less complex versions. Pandemic for example is very popular (start with the original). However, co-op games aren't for everyone, so instead pick up Forbidden Desert or Forbidden Island. Designed by the same guy, similar kind of co-op, but also considerably cheaper. Another game I picked up was Drakon-you have to escape from the dragon's dungeon which you build yourself as you make your way through it, stealing gold and screwing over your friends.  
If in doubt, I would suggest starting with Settlers of Catan, Carcassone, Forbidden Desert/Island, King of Tokyo/New York, and Gloom.

Catan is about exploring and building an island/community, trading produce #woodforsheep, building roads and settlements.  
Carcassone is similar, but primaryly tile based. Both games have multiple expansions that are not essential to your enjoyment.  
King of New York/Tokyo is a dice rolling Godzilla/King Kong style game, fighting off other monsters and the army. Classic Ameritrash I believe.
Gloom... It's a card game where you're telling the story of how your family dies. It's gimmick is that it's printed in clear plastic, so when you lay a card on top of another, it changed the modifiers that inevitably result in your family's deaths. It's casual, so half the fun is the optional storytelling aspect which affect the game in no real way, but enhance the experience.  

Hopefully this helps you a little!
Well kingdom death ks starts in 3 hours. My best friend said "i would be mad with regrett if i let it pass" this is after playing something of 30-40 hours playing and still not even at 20% of the game. 

If you like a game, get it! If you have a board game cafe anywhere near you, get some friends and playtest the games you're thinking about purchasing. (Read the rules beforehand, though.)

If you liked Mansions of Madness, look into Elder Sign and its expansions. You collect stuff, defeat rooms, and face an Elder God.

Zombicide is great. A game similar to Zombicide is Dead of Winter. It's co-op, but everyone has secret missions. There are zombies, weapons, an interesting dice mechanic, and cool characters. There's always a lot of action, lots of zombies, and lots of danger.

If you like RPGs, try Above and Below. It's an exploring and city building game. Gorgeous, easy to learn; you send your workers on adventures underground and never know what scenario they'll run into.

Buy the games you enjoy and don't worry about its rating/reviews unless it has truly unforgivable mistakes.
Stay away from kickstarters if you're new to the hobby! There's tons of board games you can buy with 0 waiting and 0 risk, so don't back a kickstarter game when you could just buy a game on amazon instead. 

It's also pretty rare for a kickstarter game to *never* hit retail these days. Don't kickstart it unless you *really* want it just as a collector's item. 

Apart from the stuff you mentioned, you might take a look at **Krosmaster Arena** or **Krosmaster Quest** if you want something co-op. Dungeon/RPG style combat with a lot of depth and tactics. Not super-complicated. Playing in teams is also a good option for larger groups. Also has a ridiculously massive number expansions for both maps and characters (but don't be intimidated, it's fun with just the base set). 

**Mice and Mystics** seems like exactly kind of the thing you're looking for. Co-op, has a campaign, combat with lots of enemies, RPG mechanics, and a nice story. Not too complicated, either. And it has expansions if you finish the campaign and want new stuff to fight. 


I think you're just playing "RPG a likes". That's fine, but you really gotta know you're doing that, and not playing the entire field of games. 

You may like a real RPG more, or a eurogame or two, or one of the modern hybrids which has fighting...but isn't a die roller.  You may even enjoy a long game that is complex instead of just long.

Check out Kemet, Quartermaster General, 1830, and Above and Below to branch out.

Rather than using generic spie and resistance members, add roles and ignore them if you're playing vanilla resistance. 

I think the accept reject tokens are more important than the "selected" for mission ones. These can be double sided cards. When I play, these are left on the table until the start of the next vote, that way they're visible when we're ready to hurl accusations. 

I'm a big fan of the inquisitor variant (lady of the lake in avalon), and it's just one more card (three more if you want to mix inquisitor with roles, but I usually just do one or the other).

I wouldn't bother with the team leader or rules cards. 
IMO, the vote cards are way more important than even the 5 round cards and 5 victory marker cards, which can just easily be tracked with coins (heads/tails) or anything else that you have lying around.

I would hate to play this game with a thumbs up/thumbs down kind of method.  It would change the game too much, slow it down, and being able to look around and see who voted what after the fact is a large part of this game.  

You could also save a few cards by putting the rules on the tuckbox itself, and/or just having them on your phone.
For the basic game, every card is essentially a yes/no card. You could improvise a game with a regular deck of playing cards using black as yes and red as no. 

* Use the face cards as character cards. 
* Use the aces to mark round victories.
* use the number cards for mission voting and as success/fail cards.
* use a joker as a team leader card.
* you can play the game without mission selection markers.
I should note that I've only played the Resistance once or twice myself (mostly because of the reasons mentioned above), which is why I'm really hoping for some advice which handful of cards add a ton of replayability/fun without making the game a lot more complex.
I'm thinking of maybe 3 or so extra roles we might be able to use sometimes to keep things interesting.
if you're gonna get it printed at printer studio or another place and get it all done, let me know, would love a smaller version as well 
You could skip the "selected for mission" cards and just hand each player a pair of success/fail cards instead.  That gives you five more cards for expansion stuff.

If you *really* wanted to save space, you could keep the rules on your phone somewhere, and replace the team leader card with any object you have handy (like the box).
They are technically toys... we should all acknowlege it
What difference does it make? The average person looking to buy Agricola or Terra Mystica isn't likely to be buying it in a story with departments like "Hobby" and "Toys/Kids". :)
Where are you shopping?

I haven't found a store that sells Agricola that has departments/sections. 
Serious Business
I've never found either of those games in a larger store. When I have found anything close to that, they've most likely been in a "Strategy Games" section and failing that at the very least "Toys/Games" which is correct.
Any of the mid weight euros, and even heavier ones at the lower player counts. I guess how simple do you want it to be is the key question.

First recommendation probably would be **Castles of Burgundy **. It has wide ranging appeal, simple rules, and stood the test of time, but 4p max. If you go lighter, then I would look at **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**. Slightly more complex, but fast playing is **Roll for the Galaxy** which can support 5p. **Keyflower** supports 3-6p, is a little more complicated, but can finish under 2h at 6p count. At the heavier end, you have **Steam** which supports multiple players counts, is not too complex rules wise and can play under 2 hr for 4p. 
Check out *Splendor*. Games are closer to a half hour but it is a fantastic game that falls under the easy to teach and hard to master. It's also 2-4 players so doesn't quite meet the player count but it's so easy to bring to the table and usually is a hit with gamers and non gamers alike.
**Innovation** seems like a good fit, only goes up to four though (and honestly it's best at two).

**Arctic Scavengers** is a really good deckbuilder for 3-5, the basic strategy is easy to understand but it's complicated by a poker-style showdown every round after the beginning. 

**Evolution** goes to 6, gets a little messy at high counts but it works well. I'd recommend getting Climate, as it contains the entire original game along with some great additions.
Blood rage is amazing. 1-2 hours, highly competitive and incorporates almost no luck. Card drafting keeps each game fresh and allows the many viable strategies to develop organically. Beautiful minis do not hurt. I've taught this game quickly to non gamers and gamers alike.
Concordia
**Puerto Rico** (only plays up to 5), **Belfort**, **Power Grid**
So, meaty games typically aren't very good with 5 or 6 players.

The only 6-player game that I don't hate (because it doesn't take forever...just half of forever) that also has a little bit of meat on it is **Alhambra: The Big Box**.  Very replayable and takes only 45-90 minutes, but...if your friends think 7 Wonders is too random, then Alhambra may suffer the same assessment.

I would encourage you to not be afraid to split into two groups if you have 6 people.  My experience with my boardgame night is that we all enjoy the night much better if we have two games of three players than one game of six.  (For strategy games that is; doesn't apply to party games of course.)

If you dropped the player count to 2-4, then there are many games that I can list that are much more skill-based than random.  Incidentally they are all favorites for me as well.

 * **Ninjato** is just an amazing, very interesting worker placement game that also looks great and for me really evokes the theme well for a euro.  I love how inter-connected all the areas are...definitely feels very hard to master to me, as there are just a lot of different ways to do things and you could spend forever trying to figure out what is optimal.  And yet...people don't usually get too hung up in analysis paralysis. 
 * **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** is probably similar complexity to 7 Wonders but might be slightly more depending on how you feel about it.  Overall it's pretty intuitive to learn/understand the rules.  But it is always very interesting to be the master builder...it's an auctioning tile-placement game where people take turns setting the prices for their opponents, keeping in mind that their opponents don't have to buy anything, but if they do, the money goes to the master builder.
 * **Dominion** takes a long time to master, I've played this more than anything else in my life (300 plays) and I still don't always win.  It's the classic deck-builder and has basically infinite replayability since you randomly determine what the main cards will be every game.
 * **Trains** is like Dominion in many ways but it has a map and it's about trains.  Love this game just as much probably.

Check out **Sylvion**. It's a little tower defense game, plays in under an hour. Your cards are both stuff you can build/use, and the resources to pay for said stuff. The advanced game includes a deck construction mini-game before the game proper which is a lot of fun.
For playing solo, I prefer Friday out of that list, and I really like playing Ascension and Thunderstone Advance (before I sold it - possibly backing the 3E Kickstarter next year) solo. Hostage Negotiator is cool, but I find it too difficult. I don't have Mage Knight, but I have Star Trek Frontiers, and while I love it, I find it daunting to play, and so it doesn't get out much. I really don't enjoy Marvel Legendary, and LE: Alien is too easy solo. Shadowrun Crossfire is not *really* meant for solo, apart from one mission for leveled-up characters, and I am not a big fan of having to manage multiple decks to play a solo version of a two-player game. I've bought Attack on Titan, because it looks pretty fun and different.
You could try Imperial Settlers or possibly even Guilds of London. GOL does not include solo rules in the box but the official rules are listed on BGG. Both of these have strong solo rules. Imperial Settlers is all about hand management, and GOL is more of a mix but the solo rules are brutal and the setup varies from game to game.
**Star Realms** got the potential for solo...so you might want to try the app out.  

Arkham LCG is the next one I am eyeing, hopefully I can grab a copy soon.

**Paperback** is pretty good as a deck builder too, as you can tweak your deck to the words you can think of. It's not reliant on knowing a strong base of vocabulary like Scrabble.

I heard good things about Aliens Legendary, but I am not a big fan of the franchise. 

**Mistfall** looks to be a good adventuring game, you can check out Rick Royal YouTube play through for it.

For a compact solo, I enjoyed **Flip City** and **Pax**
I personally think Legendary Encounters is much better than Marvel.
Consider **Baseball Highlights: 2045.** It's an excellent deck builder that plays great solo and at 2-player. You don't need to like or even know how to play baseball to enjoy it!
The classic suggestion is **Mage Knight**, it's got deckbuildingish stuff, and it's got extensive solo play. Give it some research and see if it appeals. 
If you like dinosaurs then the best deckbuilder for solo you can get is **Apex: Theropod**. It's crazy thematic and designed specifically for solo play. The game contains many different dinosaurs to choose from for your player deck and different bosses to fight against. Essentially you hunt other dinosaurs which you can then use to buy better cards for your deck.

The game is limited to 9-12 rounds (depending on your chosen difficulty) and you have to kill the boss before a huge asteroid hits earth and all dinosaurs go extinct.

My favorite hand management game is **Race: Formula 90**. Technically it's not a solo game but with a few small house rules you get a very tense and thematic solo experience. Beware that this game is a simulation and therefore has many rules and not the best rulebook. Once you get over that initial speed bump the game plays very quickly.
Thunderstone Advance
If you like word games, Paperback is a good option. 
Mistfall has limited deckbuilding but is great for hand management

The sewing on those meeple plushies looks awful. The designs on the two shirts that aren't your game are bland and generic.
They use the same core [C&C](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Command_and_Colors_system) command card mechanic: map has three sections, each command card in your hand orders specific unit types or units on specific sections. Rest of it is very different.

BL1 gives victory points based on kills, BL2 is 100% objective/king of the hill based.

BL1 has set scenarios with set troops, BL2 has variable scenario setup (each side has 7 half-scenario cards, connect two cards and boom, a scenario) with variable troops (50 muster points, each unit has a specific cost, go nuts).

BL1 has a shared lore deck, BL2 has faction specific lore cards.

Thematically BL1 is medieval historic with some goblins and dwarves thrown in, feels a bit weird as a result. BL2 is straight up generic FFG fantasy.

There's other random bits here and there but those are the big ones that sprang to mind. I'd say BL1 is a decent enough way to test drive BL2. But at the same time I'd say that ANY commands & colours game is a decent way to test drive the commands & colours system.
One big thing to consider is that Massive Darkness is made by CMON, who makes these kinds of games all the time. Vampire Hunters looks like these guys first game. That doesn't mean they can't pull it off, but there is substantially more risk involved. Who is making their minis? Their Kickstarter page seems to just have renders, that's another red flag for me. 

I would (and did) go with Massive Darkness.
Funny enough I was actually recently debating this as well. I ended up backing late for massive Darkness because it just seems overall like the more enjoyable and fine-tuned game. Both look great and I'm sure eventually I'll have both but I put my money on massive Darkness.
China would be proud of the amount of red flags in the Vampire Hunters kickstarter(s). Go get Massive Darkness.
MD won't have any reviews for quite a while. I am a backer, and the game is built on top of the Zombicide gameplay, but with added depth. MD brings in skill trees, a different dice combat system, and the best loot is earned from defeating bosses. I had looked into VH when it launched on kickstarter, but to me it just looked like a clone of Zombicide with not that much depth added in. I don't think either game will end up being bad, so I think what everything really comes down to is theme. Do you want a fantasy dungeon crawler or a vampire hunting game?
Carcassonne, Dominion, Citadels, Castles of Burgundy. Basically any game about building a medieval kingdom.  Although i have not played "kindom builder"

It just seems to be the theme of quality and stability. 
**Cosmic Encounter**

**Jaipur**

**Heroscape**

**Go**

**Princes of Florence**

**Puerto Rico**

**Samurai**

**Sekigahara**

**Twilight Imperium**

All games that still hit the table with some regularity. I think if a game has a certain amount of depth *in relation* to the playtime and complexity, as well as having a level of elegance and focus in design, it's something that will hold up for a long time.

Disclaimer: there are a lot of older games I have yet to play
**Carcassonne** and **Agricola**.

2 games that have been in my collection for a long time and both still played regularly,,,
These games will be in my collection forever:

* Pandemic
* Ghost Stories
* 7 Wonders
* Race for the Galaxy
* Stone Age
Race for the Galaxy
Agricola
I have always been a huge fan of **Samurai Swords** and **Axis & Allies**.  There is a reason they are still in print.  

Also, **BattleTech** has been around for forever, and the basic system is the exact same.  That is for a reason.  It is really good.
I still play **Acquire** pretty regularly, and it was published when JFK was president.  I play a fair amount of **Titan** too, and that's from 1980.
El grande, Puerto Rico, Euphrates and Tigris come to mind. 
 * **Dominion** - hundreds of plays later, still love it.  I've played many other deckbuilders and this classic is actually still my favorite (although Trains might derail it)
 * **Alhambra** is still a staple light-strategy game for me.  Replayability with the big box is through the roof.
 * **Go**.  Thousands of years old and still one of the best games of all time IMO.  This is one of two games (the other is Dominion) where I have read tons of strategy articles about it and participated in the meta to some degree.

Though I've already seen it mentioned at least twice here, I've probably played **Go** as many times as all other games combined. 
How about 3 years old expansion for a much older game?

Settlers of Catan, Explorers and Pirates expansion.

It turns Catan into a racing game with very little trading.  Less about the cards - though they certainly help get the race started - but it's still a fun medium weight game that gets Catan on the board without the fourth player feeling useless.

I've seen people win with pirates and spice, fish and harbors, or a little of each.
The BGG forums are by far the best place to check rules, and no in the prologue you don't get any of the end game rewards. Believe it does clarify this in the rulebook where it explains end game.
The welcome sheet tells you point blank there are no end game rewards at the end of the prologue. I'd read that again.
No, the only permanent changes that you make during the prologue are naming the islands, the results of exploration, and anything that the Captain's Booke explicitly tells you to do when you complete a milestone. 

We found one of the instructions at the end of the prologue confusing, so here's a hint: [Spoiler](/s "Only do things to components that are currently being used in the game.") 
>(I haven't read into the Captain's Booke yet)

And you never should, unless the game tells you to. Just wanted to point that out in case you decided to crack it open after finishing the rulebook. :)
Obligatory "this is from Jul 2014 but has just been uploaded to YouTube" comment
I own this game and all expansions. Well worth it. There is so much replayability due to army creation and the way the scenarios work. It's great fun. It's a shame that it seems like there aren't anymore expansions coming out but I'd still recommend it. There is still a crap ton of content and game play with what is out there currently. 
How long until SUSD run out of old videos?
Love this game!
Hilarious timing on this reupload.
Go on eBay, and get 1 yard of 2mm neoprene. Should be about 15$. Almost as good as the magic mats, will cover your whole table, and is a great surface. It's what I used for my game table.
You have any craft stores nearby that sell fabric? Hobby lobby, joann's or even walmart will probably have all kinds of vinyl and felt you can buy by the yard and cut down to fit your table.
It's a bit pricey but I love this Quiver gaming mat. http://quivergaming.com
I got in on a group order of this and cut it to my table length. Works great 

http://gameplusproducts.com/product/solid-black-table-roll-waterproof-24-x-29-makes-3-8ft-table-mats-or-4-6ft/
If you want a good quality pre-made solution for under $50 then I think your best bet is a roll up poker mat.

* Pill Shaped (for rectangular tables) http://a.co/hVLxvVY 
* Circular http://a.co/atipgHd 

They feel like a giant mouse pad.  It's standard neoprene.

Before I got my gaming table I used both of these on the different tables I have on my game nights.  They work excellently, come in various colors, and are much cheaper than most hobby game mats.

Some of the prices for hobby game mats is insane.
My personal budget solution is **baize**, it's snooker table cloth and pretty cheap, more so than a card table cloth. I have a 1½ by 2 metre that I take with me to gaming clubs - but it gets fluffy and isn't really machine washable.
I use something similar to velvet (like the offspring of velvet and polar fleece) from the local fabric store, but cheaper. I won't play without it. 

I also use picnic table clips under the table to hold it snug. 
Recently I went to a fabric store and got a large piece of felt for my table. Works great for games of any type. A small hit on the wallet and great value!
there are several companies that make large wargaming mats made of similar materials.  These are usually fairly regular in size (in feet), 3x3 or 3x6, or 4x8 being common.  One example is http://www.gamematz.com/pro-matz-gaming-mats/

I personally just bought a large sheet of neoprene from http://www.hookloopoutlet.com and cut it to fit my table exactly.
Should check out Yoga Mats.  They are really durable and fairly cheap.  This is the one I use, it's extra wide and long so it fits my table perfectly.  My table is a bit narrow and really long so it might not fit normal tables, but check out the dimensions.

Forgive my lack of formatting since I'm on mobile but Target has something called a Comfort Kitchen Mat. It looks like it's on sale right now and most stores will have it for in-store pickup. It's 40"x20" and you can double up and go side-by-side if you need to. It's not exactly like a mousepad but it's a 1/4" thick foam like a yoga or gymnastic mat and the top is like a linen.

 http://www.target.com/p/threshold-comfort-kitchen-mat/-/A-21495974

I have two for my table at home and they work great! 
Ive used a sheer of felt from Hobby Lobby and it worked fine and was dirt cheap.
Games for a princely sum.

Hopefully Ghost Stories goes on sale, but it's been over three years since a (one day) price drop. Really, Repos? Your IP is so precision and lucrative that you can't have ONE SALE in three years?
"Prince drop"
Forbidden Desert has been on my wishlist, so I'm gonna grab it. Hopeful that a few others on my wishlist (Baseball Highlights, San Juan, Camel Up) go on sale this week or over the Christmas Holiday. 

I've got a lot of BG Apps, but there are a few I'm just not sure will get as much playtime as others. Generally speaking, I like to support developers and the hobby - but there are a few that I would admittedly grab on sale as I'm just not sure they'd get a whole lot of playtime. 
Wow, I bought 2 of these games in the last week.
Slightly more on the Canadian store (just grabbed Glass Road for 2.79$) but still good deals. Thanks for the heads up.
Nice, grabbed Small World and Forbidden Desert, had most of the rest.

Thanks!
The creators have specifically asked people not to make and then sell custom Tak sets online. Since its their game, that they went through all the development and testing for, its not an unreasonable request.

Which expansions will you have to choose from? Which campaign are you playing? I have a number of insights, though a few of them will depend on how big the scope of play is.
Don't get caught up killing monsters. It may seem like you're supposed to kill the monsters but that's not your goal. 

On a related note: don't let the over lord convince you only they get to see the scenario book. This isn't dnd and they aren't a dungeon master. Some of the scenarios can't be won by the party if they don't get to see the scenario book. 
So an update. ****Minor Spoilers****  

We're playing "Heirs of Blood".  
The OL has some kind of Vampire Lieutenant.  
Our Party:  
Lindel (Treasure Hunter) - Me  
Elder Mok - (Prophet)  
High Mage Quellen - (Runemaster)  
Reynhart the Worthy - (Champion)   

We set up and played through the first mission. The OL completed his task before us and we left with 175 Gold. Not bad for a first go according to the OL.  
We struggled staying focused on the mission and although we felt we had a good strategy for each of our turns we didn't really have an overriding strategy for the mission. We know that now.  
We were missing someone with a good ranger weapon, so all our combat was close quarters.  
All in all a fun night, learned a ton and looking forward to the next mission.  
The OL has given us all the opportunity to change classes at this stage if we feel so inclined. We'll go shopping at the start of the next mission. We all have 1 experience to spend too.  
That's it for now. Thanks again for getting me prepped :)

Obligatory Patchwork suggestion.
It sounds like you jumped into the medium to heavy games before you tried the standard introductory games like Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, Catan and Sushi Go. If need be go on BoardGameGeek and look for two player variants. Start her off slow and allow her to find her groove. I play games with my wife and some of them she likes and others she doesn't but together, when she is having fun, I am having fun.
What games have you tried with her? Sounds like you've ruined her goodwill with them just because you only try heavy things with her. If you played light games with her she'd probably like them.
My wife also doesn't like anything long or complicated,  but she really enjoyed Lords of Waterdeep.  Has fantasy theme and let's her work on her own quests with very little direct competition.  

Right now she likes Castles of Mad King Ludwig.  And she's always enjoyed coop Games like pandemic and Consulting Detective.
My wife isnt a gamer.  She doesnt like heavy games or eveb medium weight games, with the odd exceptiong of Powergrid.

Try **Splendor** or **Lords of Waterdeep**, my wife loves those two and they both fit your tume requirement.
Carcassonne, jaipur, battleline, 7 wonders: duel, targi, akrotiri, Survive: Escape from Atlantis or Pandemic.
I am going to suggest **Mysterium** 

It is a co-operative game that I think really defies what a board game typically is. It is a game like clue, but instead of being deduction based, one player is a "ghost" that knows the murderer and must tell the players through showing them art peices. In 2-player mode, it really becomes a game about communication the guesser needs to be very vocal about their thought process and has nobody to else rely upon, and the ghost needs to try and get inside the guesser's head. The art is really incredibly stunning as well.

I have to suggest Takenoko, Carcassonne, and Paperback if she is a reader. 

Also, most any co-op game. Work together and don't play just to win. 

Also, my wife is not a gamer. Just getting some games she enjoyed, we now get to spend time together that isn't sitting and reading our screens. 

It doesn't matter if you love the games. Just being able to share a sliver of gaming with her was great for me. 
What themes does she like?

[This Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5e92u7/best_games_for_under_3000_2016_edition/) should provide you with a good mix in inspiration for games in that price bracket. (Though, note that is for 30 USD games, not £30 games. Still, some of the games listed there are with heavy online retailer discounts. 

But really, as rakino says, it depends on your group, what you like and dislike. Very few games work well for everyone.
Wasn't sure how to price them from the States, but Amazon has some that are worth it for that range.

It depends on your group. Personal favourites of mine that fall into a lower price bracker include Isle of Skye, Carcassonne, Race for the Galaxy, Glass Road, Castles of Burgundy, Fleet, Lewis and Clark, Power Grid, and Smash Up.
**Race for the Galaxy** is our group's favorite game in that price bracket, it's like $20-25 (and I think $>£).  Tons of depth and replayability once you learn the dozen or so symbols that are used in the game.  
I hate the former and, at least, really like the latter so... get **Great Western Trail**. :) 

And its only essential to get at least six players for **Captain Sonar** but there'll be no spot for the person that wants little to do when a team has only three players. 
**Great Western Trail** arrived a couple of weeks ago and we already have 5 plays in.  It's my second 10 rated game on BGG.  The various mechanics integrate elegantly and while there are many factors to consider each turn plays rather quick.  

I haven't played, or wanted to play, the other games listed.
Keyflower!
I would recommend gwt over cry havoc which I found inferior to blood rage/kemet (similar area control games)
Deck builders just don't work that we'll with large groups because turns take too long and there is little to do while it isn't your turn.

Maybe a card drafting game like 7 wonders or sushi go?
I've never heard "nerfed" used in that way. In video gaming, it means to take something and make it less powerful, often in reference to weapons. Basically, they take a super powerful weapon away from you and replace it with a Nerf version of that weapon.

As for your actual question, I've not played a deck builder that I liked at more than 4 players. There is just too much downtime. I think you would be better served looking into drafting games, or splitting into 2 games.
I'd recommend playing two groups of three or another game other than a deckbuilder for 6. Most games are good with 2-4. Some are good at 5. The ones that are good at 6 are typically unicorns or party games.

The main problem is the time between turns. With a lot of players, there's a lot of time between actions and players get bored.
If your group doesn't mind the downtime of playing a larger player count deck builder, my group who is this way has enjoyed **Ascension** and **Valley of the Kings**. In both cases you will need two base sets of the game (or at least a base set and expansion for Ascension).

For Ascension, I like how Realms Unraveled and Dawn of Champions mix. 

For Valley of the Kings you'd want the original one and Afterlife since Last Rites has some different starting cards in it.
**Apex Theropod** is a fun deckbuilder, and it plays up to six. **Big Book of Madness** plays up to five.
Buy 2 copies of **Baseball Highlights: 2045** and play an 8 person tournament!
I made an MTG Cube of commons for cheap. It plays that many. First you draft all the cards, then you play a round robin tournament.
And here Ive been using Nerf wrong all along, my bad...thanks for letting me know! Thats what I get  for trying to sound all knowledgeable :) And  downtime doesnt  matter too much to us, weve learned to be patient, have had many  times playing with others that take years for their turn
**Theomachy** is of a deck building game that you might like then. It is essentially poker but you play as Gods bidding your worshippers. Just make sure to play the Non-elimination mode. 
I have a 12-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl, and your kids might be different, but I can tell you that the one game I can always get them to play with me is **Bohnanza**. They love the trading, it sometimes leads to arguments (but not always), and it's simple and quick enough for us all to play. The only problem is there's no decent two-player version. We play the hell out of it here though. 
I think they might be ready for **Pandemic**. This co-op game will teach them to strategize and work together as a team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest board games ever made. 

Good deal on amazon at the moment.

[Pandemic Board Game ](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00A2HD40E/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_AeSnybACDCB6P)
**Codenames** (of any variety) is a bit 'meh' for two.

I'd recommend **Survive: Escape from Atlantis**, it will get all their sibling frustrations out in the boardgame...
What about forbidden island or forbidden desert. I do not think they cost much and are cooperative. 
I also have tsuro at the school I work at and my students enjoy that one.
HUGE FYI HERE: This guy is in Hungary not the US, so the $20-30 may not be relevant as games are more expensive there
I don't know about hungarian prices but take a look at **indigo** by reiner knizia. It is made in Czech Republic so is probably not too expensive with shipping etc. Basically it's a strategy game about drawing a path using random tiles, trying to get stones from the center of the board to your goal in order to score them. It is a very beautiful game with Byzantine inspired art.  

/u/r2d8 getinfo
**Bohnanza**  
**Sushi Go Party!**  
**6 Nimmt!**  
Those three are cheap and offer a lot of replayability. They are for all ages so your kids can still play them many years later.
King of Tokyo! We just picked it up and have been playing it with our 10yo girl and we've been having a blast. 

Sheriff of Nottingham has been a lot of fun as well. (it took a couple games before she fully got it though, and the "role-playing" as the sheriff can be a lot of fun for children around those ages)
Dixie doesn't work with two players but Mysterium does.


**Takenoko**

**Escape: Curse of the Temple**

**Rhino Heroes**

**Super Rhino / Rhino Heroes** Is a fun reverse Jenga/Uno thing. Kids love building it and knocking it over.

I think **Loony Quest** is great for everyone as well, especially if the kids are into any sort of video games
King of Tokyo

Tsuro

Blokus
Check out Death Angel if they're up for something a little darker. Cheap, fun, great for two, and it expands well. 

And there's always Catan if you can find a sale and your family hasn't played it to death yet. 
I love that we've gotten to a point where a 3 sentence post needs a tl;dr.
I can't help on the board game front, though something themed on dictatorships might have something interesting. There is a game on steam called 'The Westport Independent' which, while not terribly well reviewed, is a game about exactly what you're discussing. It might be worth looking at just for ideas on how you might bring that idea to the tabletop.
Penny Press, I guess. Haven't played it but I know it's about running a newspaper.
**Extra Extra** by Mayfair Games deals with publishing a newspaper, but I am not sure it is exactly what you are looking for
If you can't find the game then make it!
First of all, they are completely different games, nothing alike except for box size. Second, I never played Tiny Epic Defenders, so I will skip it. 

Tiny Epic Kingdoms is a 4X-ish where players have a single action pool to share, and each player selects one and the other may follow (kinda like Puerto Rico, though all players perform equally ).  Its pretty fun, and it doesn't take a lot of time. I like it. Never played the expansion, though. 

Tiny Epic Galaxies is a dice based game where players have to manage actions according to the dice rolled to expand their empires by collecting resources, upgrading their base and conquering planets. It had a similar follow mechanic, though now players have to pay to do it. It's a very sharp game, a bit fiddly, but very very good. The expansion, Beyond the Black, I would say it's a must have, but it does give a bit of variety to the base game. 

Finally, Tiny Epic Western is a worker placement game mixed with poker (sort of). You get the benefits of where you place your meeple, but you're also in to win more stuff if you have the better 3 card poker hand. So far, it's my favorite. It works best with bigger counts because it's harder to just keep it to yourself, and this game is at its best when it's competitive. Also, bullet dice, need I say more? 
Upvote for the title.
TE Kingdoms - First one. Quite good little 4x game, better with Heroes' Call expansion. Some of the factions are definitely more powerful than others though. (also has an Ultra Tiny version which is great for portability but doesn't have the expansion)

TE Defenders - probably the weakest of the series. It's kind of a castle defense game, but with random turn order and increasing pressure from enemies. It's not bad, but not my favorite. It just feels like a lot of luck is involved because of the random turn order mechanism.

TE Galaxies - Fantastic dice chucker. Kind of like a more streamlined version of Roll for the Galaxy. Plays really well solo and very quick. Easily my favorite so far, and has an expansion coming out very soon that seems to add a lot more content and options.

TE Western - Most complex of the series. A mashup of 3-card poker and worker placement. It's quite interesting, but seems pretty fiddly. Good theme, but a bit abstract with some rules feeling somewhat forced in my opinion. 

TE Quest - Obviously the new one and an insta-buy for me. Not much more to tell you then what the KS says. 

I own and enjoy them all, but TEG is my favorite. I've probably played it most, with TEK a close second. They added an official solo mode to TEK with the expansion (and inside the Ultra Tiny version) that is quite challenging, but straightforward and fun. I'm addicted to the Tiny Epic series myself, but I'd highly recommend TEG and TEK with expansions, then also Tiny Epic Quests, but that's basically just a hunch. 

All have fallen flat with me and my group. It feels like all of the games **could** be really good, but they've sacrificed the *epic-ness* to be tiny. TEGalaxies is the only one we might think about getting to the table, but that's super rare. I love the idea of TEQuest, but am afraid/certain that I will come away from it with a lackluster experience again. 
I just got **Tiny Epic Western** and I love it. The rules aren't entirely thought out so there are a ton of questions/errata that come up, but otherwise it's a really fun take on Texas Hold'em that may intrigue a mixed group of beginner gamers and hardcores alike.
Tiny Epic Western is good. That said, although the box itself is small..ish, the game itself is fairly decent size.
I am madly in love with Tiny Epic Galaxies.  Just a wonderful game, especially as a solo experience.  

However, it's the only Tiny Epic I've played.
Tiny Epic Galaxies is my favorite TE game so far. A lot of cool components, a complex but easy to learn set of rules, excellent competitive mechanics and very fun to play, even the solitaire version.

I think it's a must in the saga
Galaxies is my favourite. Full dice chucking space games.

Western is fiddly and more complex but another hit with me and my group.

I have found that the Tiny Epic series has been stellar and I backed Quest day one with no hesitation.
I have them all but of the released ones I love Galaxies and Western the most.
From what I've heard, the other games are all pretty good.  I've heard especially good things about Galaxies.  The main complaint most people seem to have is that there is really no point to them being "Tiny."  If you can get past the unnecessary gimmick I think you'll be happy with them.
Honestly... they're pretty mediocre. TED is a serviceable co-op, but there are better competitors at similar price points. TEK is quite bad without the expansion, with it it becomes a playable distillation of 4x mechanics, but again, surpassed by games like **Impulse** or **Pocket Imperium** by a wide margin. TEW I had high hopes for, but after one play I have put it on my sell pile. I think it's the worst of the lot, it takes too long, and is way too complex for the gameplay you get out of it. The poker mechanism is kind of cool but the rest of the game is a slog.

TEG is the only one I'll be happy to play, but again, there are better games out there. It's a dice game with some interesting stuff going on, and it also plays well solo. That said, I'm ambivalent enough about it to have not backed the recent expansion on KS. Like all the rest of the TE games, it's only tiny in box size, and overstays it's welcome. I want these games to play in 30-45 minutes and they almost always run closer to 90, at which point I have many other games I'd rather play.

Quest looks like it could be pretty good, but I don't like how you have a whole map full of unique cards effects that you have to read before starting. Sounds like it will induce AP and once again go longer than it should. The item meeples are cool, though, might be worth backing at $20 just to put them in other games.  
Of what I own, **Pax Porfiriana** for me. There are a few chits which are just counters but outside of that, it's just setting up a big deck of cards.
**Sekigahara** and **Polis: fight for the hegemony** are two excellent 2 player games with little set up. 
Mottainai - just a deck of cards and a small user guide / mat. 

As for being heavy - learning curve is a bit high and there's a lot of decision making, knowledge and experience needed to get a great engine running in my opinion. 
Well **Diplomacy** for sure. But let's leave it at that.

**Tigris and Euphrates** is basically a bunch of tiles, and a majority of them are going to be in a bag for most of the game. 

And just because I can, I'm going to say **Wallenstein** and **Shogun**. Yes, there are all kinds of fiddly bits but you get to take them and dump them into a tower which is really fun. And it's not considered fiddly if you're having fun with them, right? Right?
Arboretum 
Not Mage Knight, that's for sure.
I'd say twilight struggle is up there. Not too many components, relatively quick setup. Very deep and quite a lengthy game
No love for **Town Center**?

I'm actually a bit surprised when I first see a 3+ weight on BGG for this. Playing this a couple more times makes me realize this game is not as simple as it looks.
**Ora Et Labora** - Definitely a brain burner with a lot of strategy and stuff going on but not a ton of fiddly mechanics since the resource wheel takes care of it all. There are a lot of resources to collect but its not bad if you have an organizer. The player aid is probably one of the best that I've seen because they crammed a massive amount of information in it and its still readable.

**Twilight Struggle** isn't the heaviest game out there, but it is incredibly deep in strategy. Not a ton of fiddly components especially if you have an organizer for the influence tokens (I use a 7 day pill box for each player it works perfectly).
Battlecon. It's really difficult because AP is sooo real. 15/20 of your options vs the 15/20 of your opponent. And it's just 9 cards in combinations of pairs. 
There are components and there are fiddly components. There is the excellent but super damn fiddly [Roads and Boats](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/28278/roads-boats?size=original), then there is a game like [1889](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/822478/1889) which is heavy, has a good number of components...but they aren't *fiddly* components you have to constantly arrange, massage and be anxious over.

For the heavy but surprisingly manageable component wise games, I'm going to go with [Captains of Industry](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131449/captains-industry) . There are tokens, but they are used smoothly for many things. There are markers, but they are very iconic and large. There are cards, but you don't have to hold them all the time. There are things to see on the board, but they're drawn huge and are visible from across the table even if not perfectly sighted. 
Imperial has the highest depth to components ratio in my game collection.
**Glass Road**. Because of the resource wheel mechanic, the game contains *no* cubes, *no* resource chits, and you're *never* pushing items into the center of the table and taking a different amount back. When you modify your resources, you always just slightly adjust your dial. That's it.
**Club Duplicate Contract Bridge.**

That shit is rocket science.
I've always felt that **Power Grid** is really good about keeping fiddly bits to a minimum. Sure, there's money, resources, and houses, but after that there's relatively few additional components to deal with.
Obvious answers: Go. And then Chess.

Modern games: Quoridor is up there. Maybe Hive, it's unclear since I've mostly played my phone for that one. Mexica is also pretty complicated.
I guess this will probably be one of the expandable card games. Let's say **Android: Netrunner** because it's my favorite.

The rules and timing structure are quite complex on their own but if you also consider all the interactions in a pool of >1000 cards then you got a really heavy game.

Components on the other hand are basically just a deck of cards and a few counters for money, tags, etc.

Most of the other heavy games I have played all have a ton of fiddly components. Maybe **Tash-Kalar** is one that has quite a lot of rules overhead compared to the number of components (just a few cards and two kinds of tokens).
**Wir sind das Volk!** has a really short setup and relatively straightforward gameplay once you wrap your head around the end-of-decade upkeep. 
Arimaa
**Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective** - Basically no setup time, but a whole lot of time thinking and strategizing.
I love how small Hansa Teutonica is box wise and how fast setup is, yet it supports such good dynamic, free style play
More on the medium end of heavy, but **Container** and **Rococo** come to mind.
Probably not the most popular choice, but Dominant Species is a long-assed game that doesn't have ten million components.
CCGs and Diplomacy.
I personally love that **Forbidden Stars** doesn't actually have thousands of tokens and such, which you would probably expect from a game like this. Yeah, it still has quite a bunch of components, but I think it's kept at a minimum and it remains very managable.
Alchemists doesn't feel fiddly at all. The only thing you need to track is your alchemy sheet, but it's pen and paper.
Explain 'fiddly'. 
If they're very young, like 3-4 or something, you could try these:

Magic Labyrinth

Outfoxed!

My First Carcassonne

Enchanted Tower

Click Clack Lumberjack

Animal Upon Animal
My secret weapon for kids is **Ghost Fightin' Treasure Hunters**.

I really hope this game isn't awful. Anything above "complete suck-fest" will probably be an instant buy for me, as Terminator is by far my favorite movie franchise (although 2 is my favorite in the series). The concept sounds really neat, and I'm definitely excited.
Wait... Wasn't there already a terminator game with miniatures? I remember seeing those miniatures quite a while back.

Edit. After some Google Fu, that was Terminator Genisys.
Sounds interesting on paper... (no pun intended). Always worry with this sort of tie in there will be too much time spent on trying to create a set of mechanics based on the theme that stifle the creation.

Sounds like this one is a bit more abstract than just being the film in game form though.
the miniatures look great 
I'm not normally a miniatures person, but the miniatures for this will probably be awesome.

That being said, I doubt the gameplay is going to be worth a damn, although I like the idea of two simultaneous boards in different timelines with different goals in theory.
could be interesting if this was some good mix between time travel and dudes on a map or something. I have trouble envisioning something different than a combat game with those terminator mini's. 

Would also be cool if the terminator's were damn indestructable like they actually felt in 1 & 2 instead of the crappy later movies. 
With the base at 250 and the gambler at 350, being on the fence it doesn't matter if I jump in now or in 42 days.. Im certainly not backing at $1,666
That is incredible. I wonder if KD:M 1.5 will set a new record for total funding for board games.
If you're interested in Pandemic Legacy, I would suggest not getting the original (or get the app and try that if you must). Why? Well, if you play through all of Legacy and still want to play Pandemic, you can buy it then, but in my experience, I will probably never touch my copy of Pandemic again. It's only up to 4 players, though.

T.I.M.E. Stories also goes up to only 4 players, and I'd recommend it too, but keeping in mind that you get only one scenario to play through, and you'll be playing it 2-4 times and that's it. You'll need to buy the expansions to keep playing. I own all the released expansions, and I plan to buy any others that come out.

Those are the only ones I've played from your list, though I am interested in playing Dark Moon.
I am definitely biased towards Betrayal. It's not mechanically heavy, or super strategic, but it oozes theme. If your group likes older B horror films, they'll love Betrayal. You could grab Betrayal, and the newly released expansion Widow's Walk for around $60 from Amazon.
I'm looking for something new in the same price range. Just bought castles of mad king Ludwig and I own Carcassonne and lotr lcg.

Right now I'm leaning towards dead of winter. Usually only play 2 people. 
Check out Letters From Whitechapel. It's a favorite in my group. One person plays as Jack the Ripper and everyone else are detectives trying to figure out where he is and arrest him before he escapes! It's the best stress ever!
Second of course. It's the improved version and more readily available.
My group prefers 1st edition by quite a margin. It is more of a classic dungeon crawl where as 2nd is kind of skirmishes.
I haven't played Ghost Stories but I love Claustrophobia. It's a great 2 player game with a lot of replayability. You can do each scenario at least twice (once as demon, once as human) and there's about 14 free scenarios from the publisher [here](http://www.claustrophobia-theboardgame.com/en/?cat=8). 

You have to like strategic placement though ("Okay, I'm going to leave this girl here and move this guy here so the demons need to burrow underground in order to spawn"...) and understand that while a dungeon crawler, you don't level up characters or equipment. Also, there's not much equipment and there's only two types of demons each scenario: Troglodyte and the Demon specific to that scenario (which is indicated on a card - the mini stays the same).

If you're okay with that and you really want to hack and slash AND have dice manipulation(ish) mechanics, then for $30 I'd say go for it. It's worth eating rice for a week. Just roast your veg in the oven, mix it with some green curry sauce and pour it over quinoa. There. Cheap, yummy, healthy suppers AND Claustrophobia.
It really depends on what you're looking for claustrophobia (haven't played it) is a player vs. player game I believe, while Ghost Stories is a co-op. In terms of replayability I've had Ghost Stories for two years and we still bring it to the table. It's got 6 variable player powers and tons of final bosses. When playing Ghost Stories you have to enjoy crushing difficulty and the reality that you won't win 90% of the time. There are many different strategies and each improves your playstyle. I can't tell you which is better but I can say Ghost Stories is a great co-op. Beautiful art too!
Claustrophobia for 30 bucks is a steal. Great price for a great two-player game. For that price, that'd be my recommendation. In reality though, if you're already over budget, maybe don't buy another game? Wait until next year. There's always gonna be another deal and new games to get.
For two players? Claustrophobia for sure.
Totally different games. Do you want a kind of light co-op or an involved 1v1 battle with some sweet minis? I've only played GS and it's serviceable, but nothing exceptional -- if you have any other co-ops they're probably just as good.

On value alone, Claustrophobia's a better deal.   
I still am of the opinion that they are actively trying to build a game as they go, instead of having a proper game already designed and ready to go. This explains the breadcrumb reveals of small pieces of gameplay, as well as the developers themselves admitting that they are still trying to figure out certain mechanics.

I cancelled my pledge and received a refund last week. I ended up taking about a $20 loss in total, between fees and the value of the pound dropping since May. I do not have any regrets abandoning this project. I was very much on the fence from the get-go, and it was against my better judgment to even back this in the first place.
I pledged to get those minis. The game was secondary for me. If it's good, I'll be very happy. If not, I still get some sweet models from an IP I love. 
I have to admit I expected more from the updates. It really seems they're still heavily working on the game and I actually hope they'll delay it to make sure the game is great instead of rushing it to meet the deadlines. They should've delayed the whole game and not only the add-ons and stretch goals. I'm sure the end product would've benefitted from the extra few months.

I'm still keeping my pledge and probably add couple of mega bosses but I'm turning a bit skeptical about the gameplay since they can't seem to get it finished, not to mention balancing and polishing and the time is running out to get everything finished for manufacturing.

There's still hope that they'll manage to make a great game. Or maybe they should do like Riot did with MvsM and invite reviewers to play the game and take a few months to adjust it based on the feedback.
I don't regret my purchase as a giant fan of the IP. I am hoping for but not expecting a great game. 

The play through through mini boss on twitch will be very telling.
One of the last updates mentioned something about being able to skip encounters you've beaten before, which is something I completely disagree with. Yeah, those enemies might seem trivial but this is Dark Souls and there's always a chance that even the easy encounters will force you to use a charge of that Estus Flask that makes you consider just going back and trying again instead of heading into the boss at less than 95%.
I split a pledge with a friend because we both like the models so much. 

I don't normally back Kickstarter projects for reasons like this. I actually don't care terribly much about the game itself. I don't have a lot of confidence in it being great. Even if the rules are good there is a good chance it won't hit the table a lot because I have a feeling it's going to be pretty brutal.

If the game comes out and it's fun, all the better. If not I'm excited to paint some of these models.
My greatest fear/disappointment at the moment is the node placement on the tiles. From all the pictures, it appears that the nodes are going to be placed in exactly the same spots as all the other tiles. I don't like this because in dark souls the environment is a key part of the combat. There should be narrow hallways, staircases, obstructing objects, different shaped rooms, and other things of that sort that make tiles different from each other. 

I expressed this concern in an AMA, and a dev assured me that node placement would be different from tile to tile and agreed with my assessment. I also found the same thing being said in 2 other places by devs (not on the actual kickstarter page though). 

https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/760/740/f938674092c55e7d8095d7004baee802_original.jpg?w=680&fit=max&v=1461076731&auto=format&q=92&s=7c8565a2aa7a950d6c1fcc5d8f7302b2

This is what I'm talking about. The different tiles are only different cosmetically. The nodes are exactly the same. I'm a bit angry that I was blatantly lied to. They didn't say they were considering doing it. They said they were currently working on it when I explicitly said my backing hinged on it. I'm not good at searching for old reddit comments so I can link it word for word.
This may be the wrong place to ask this, but does anyone know how people can get their hands on the game if they missed the kickstarter? I saw this ages ago and wanted to pledge but forgot about it. Am I too late?
I think just about all the updates they've posted in the last week have been great, the only thing I have a reservation about is everyone starting back at the bonfire as soon as someone dies.  I understand why they are doing that but it just sounds silly.
You guys have GOT to stop buying games just because you like the IP they're based on.  Otherwise this is just going to keep happening.
Steamforge has admitted they've been working on a lot of concepts during the campaign, so I'm not really surprised. I watched the Dancer fight they originally showed off, and thought it looked like a ton of fun, so I pledged. I don't paint minis so I just wanted the game. I have no doubt this will be an enjoyable game, especially after seeing the new changes!
I am excited for it. Looks like a fun game and modular enough to customize for increased enjoyment. Don't like the 1 death rule? Change it. Want to make the game easier or insanely harder? Change encounter deck. Want to take on a boss gauntlet, little or no encounters? Do it! 4 invaders equals a really tough boss? Cool!

I feel people are being overly vocal and critical of the game... If you want to jump off the project that is fine, but is all the bitching and moaning really helping anything? just bail quietly please. As someone who is interested in the project, I don't care if $10 extra shipping was the last straw...
There is no game is the box, just a set of miniatures.
Tonight is the live stream of the game by SFG. If it looks like a train-wreck, I'll see about getting a refund. I do hope it's a really great play through and alleviates the fears people have.
I'm behind SFG as a company, but it seemed from the start that they weren't given enough lead-in time, likely by Namco wanting to time the KS near the release of DS3. At least they're actively working on it, and it's actively developing into a game. I just hope the fan suggestions don't make a mess of it. A lot of times these things turn out an awful mess, every once in a while they pull a Kingdom Death and despite everything end up amazing. Fingers crossed!
I think it still looks fantastic, the rules generally make sense to me.  Personally I don't understand all the complaining about rules people have never experienced. The rules are made on the basis of a load of play testing and I'm sure we can all agree that is the best way to judge them. The amount of whining about rules people have theory crafted with no personal testing is ridiculous.  

I love the recent updates to the traps etc,  I love the play until one dies idea,  genuine teamwork required,  control of the threat marker will be essential. Really hoping they stick to their core game release date.  
I want to check it out but I don't want to give Bamco any more money. They've ruined this series.
A great time to back the kdm ks i say.
I'm all but certain to wait for retail and reviews now. Seems crazy complicated for the sake of being so. I don't even mind lots of icons but this is a mess. 
This is a hilarious rules explanation. It's like Cones of Dunshire. Even the setup is hilarious.

"Place one of the royal tokens on the King tile."

Ok, cool.

"Next, flip 5 other royal tokens to reveal prayer beads."

wait - what?

"Then, place 4 prayer beads on the monk tile."

uh, ok, I guess that's - 

"Then, place the remaining prayer bead on the golden chicken."

help
This game seems so ridiculously complicated - 30 minutes of explanation at full speed and I'm still confused about much of the game. There seems to be loads of rules exceptions and the art direction has taken precedence over clear iconography.

This might sound like nitpicking, but I'm colourblind and I'm not sure why the designer has chosen such similar colours for the different goods and different player tokens - hopefully they change this before production.
I don't even know what to say, fiddly mess is all that comes to mind.
Hello everyone. This is Mark the designer of Feudum. I am happy to answer questions about the game. I have played many heavy Euros, and consider Feudum medium heavy. I'll admit, I thought the Cones of Dunshire comment was funny. I often think of that as I explain the rules to new folks, haha. But, believe me when I say, that the after a single playthrough things begin to click.  I agree the setup is involved, but the intent was to create a nuanced game of substance with a working ecosystem. I am fairly new to the Reddit community, and welcome your feedback. Please know that I listen intently to constructive criticism. It has driven me to create a better game. That said, while I have had some less than favorable reactions, I have also been VERY encouraged to receive excellent reviews from lifelong gamers. One such review was from Lance from the Undead Viking.  I took his words to be a good sign that I was on the right track and had designed something special. I hope you agree. Here's what he said:  "This is completely unlike anything that I've played. It had that moment of freshness. I've played well over a thousand games now. For me to actually find that in a game, is astounding to me! When i can find a game that gives me that 'Whoa' type of reaction, i get excited again! Feudum is a rarity of rarities in the board game world. I can't recommend it enough! It is beautiful. It has high interactivity between you and the other players. It has that quintessential multiple paths to victory that everyone seems to love. I judge a game by how many plays I can get out of it. Feudum feels like it's a Pandora's box of that thing that I’m looking for: Tons of exploration and tons of ways to win. This is a game that I will be pulling down on a repeated basis. The game is absolutely fantastic." - Lance Myxter of Undead Viking

Thanks for listening.
I'll repeat what I've said before but has anyone looked over the rules? There's so much stuff that your cards do that isn't listed on the cards. This will make it a nightmare teach I feel as evidenced by the practically half hour video. Basically "how does this work?" and "can I look at the rulebook" every minute. It does not look very intuitive to teach or play initially and yes, I get that might be just the way the game is but really, are we at the point where we have to remember all the edge cases or extra actions a card does that aren't listed on. the. card.? Was excited about this too and even the ugh give everyone 11 cards to pick 4 from isn't as bad as Glass Road but the actions are just too detailed and each has to be mostly remembered. Yes, move means move a pawn but you also get to pilfer afterwards. Where's the iconography for that? I was excited... :(
I held off backing this, as I didn't want to get swept away by the hype. A lot of reviewers were talking about the game, but none of them had actually played it. Sure, the game looks great, but especially so with a new, untried designer, a game needs more than a novel look to earn my tithe.

I prefer heavier games - Arkwright, Brass, 18xx, Lacerda - so the complexity of so many moving parts appeals to be, but this video did a poor job of explaining how all those rules intermesh. It ain't a simple rules set, so a light [-hearted] overview that touched on the many rules without really explaining them was always going to make it seem more convoluted, not less so.

Then I watched Undead Viking's review.  And while it isn't as polished as the animated video, it does a far better job of explaining how all those rules work together.  It gave a real sense of the many mechanisms acting synergistically - especially how area control elements of the main board influence your Guild dominance, which in turn allow you to control one part of the flow of goods - to really expand the decision space, suggesting a fair degree of strategic depth.

I happily backed it the next day.
I have understood Bios:Genesis. This will be a cake-walk.
(Still not backing, too expensive)
This is a perfect example of elegance being sacrificed for complexity to achieve depth of gameplay. 

Glad I am not backing it, especially at the ridiculous price they are asking for it. 
I backed this on day one and then was a little dismayed by some of the discussion on here (though that tended to be about additional cost for the add-on expansions). Watching this video though got me pumped up again. I'm really impressed with how they're handling this Kickstarter campaign. I agree with the complaints about the expansions not being included and I don't think I'm going to be picking any of them up. Watching this video, there is more than enough game for me. 
This is clearly the best "How to play" video ever made.  And the game it is teaching looks like a parody of a heavy euro game.  I cannot believe how atrociously complicated it is, and glad I skipped the kickstarter.
I have to watch it again, but it does sound pretty heavy and interesting. December will be a rough month for my wallet with **Feudum**, **Lisboa**, and the second edition of **Vast: The Crystal Caverns** all on Kickstarter at the same time.
Anyone else getting a Cones of Dunshire feel from this game?
I thought this video was very well done and explained the rules in a clean, concise way that is  easy to follow. That said, I have had the privilege to get a run through from this game and believe it embraces a very unique multiple paths to victory format while having a unique way of "push-pull" mechanic in the guild system. Complicated - yes. Incomprehensible- no. But what do you expect? This is a heavy Euro type game.

At the end of the day, this is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. It is a heavier Euro. If your type of game is Crokinole or Risk where you don't care for a lot of thinking through permutations and what your opponents will do. You probably won't enjoy this game as much. Granted that, I think the game's appeal is beyond artwork but the strategic replayability, I believe that the appeal will show over time. Begin fortunate to playtest this, I have also got a chance to talk to Mark. From talking to him, I know that he is one that pays great attention to detail, cares about feedback and strives to make the game better.

My 2 cents is this. If you love heavy Euro games with good competitive strategy with no one single way to win. This is going to be a great game to try out. Think of it like the first time you take a dive in a pool or something that is challenging. Once you break through the curve, it's worth it. Trust me, I've had a chance to play this game and have been thinking of new strats to attempt for future plays.
I'm so excited about this one. The art, the interconnectedness of the mechanics, the attention to detail... I just can't wait to play this one for myself. 
This looks like a total mess.
This is rubbish. 12 minutes in and I'm out. Give me Twilight Imperium. It is pretty, though 
Oh dear. The game looks interesting, but I'm really not looking forward to teaching this to my gaming group...
There seems to be a lot a panic about the setup video. This isn't how the game plays, it's just an alternative rules and setup source.  I've played the game several times and I never even read the rules (though I know them now, after going through the motions, in-game a few times). At this point, setting up the game isn't difficult because I know that the Arbiter and Warriors should get their cones for... no wait, that's another game... I mean, setup is easy because I know what a royal seal and a prayer bead are now. It's a simple game to play, it's just difficult to win-

This guy says it pretty well:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz2g9hLKMbI
I've played a prototype of the game with the creator and it really is an awesome game. Yes, it is a bit complicated to learn but plays easily once you get going. I'll see if I can ask Mark, the creator, to pop in and address concerns here. This game is very much worth playing and backing. 
This game looks awesome to me, but I dont know if I'll like it much not playing it first... :/
I don't think a slight "shacks cam" effect is the way to go for a video explaining rules of a board game. Plus the quick pans make it hard to follow. Somebody went a bit too crazy with the composing and editing tools here. 
Use a site like camelcamelcamel to see the trend over time and the lowest and highest prices 
Do this take into account postage? I saw a few things I've wanted around but went with my LGS for most of them because adding on postage made them almost the same price.  
  
There is nothing wrong with getting yourself a good deal and getting the best value you possibly can, but if you don't actually take a chance and buy something, yes, you'll save the most money, but you won't actually have any games. As much as you can theorize and speculate, that's all you can really do until the sales. You see something for what you think is a good price (with postage), go for it. 
Robinson Crusoe is the older edition, the newest will be released in a couple of weeks and goes for under fifty now with deluxe components. Def pass on that.



lol all the shame games down at the bottom, photobombing your nice stuff :)


Nice work in just one year!
That's quite a solid collection. A lot of excellent games in that mix. What's your favorites of the bunch?
I have a few of these. Solid years worth. Looks like you have covered alot of genres. No lcg's. Try arkham horror lcg it's great
How is Onirim/Sylvion/Castillion?  I know they are solitaire games but they seem intriguing.
The expansion to Smash Up get pretty fun. As a make adult, the pretty princess expansion is pretty hilarious, and you can lie to yourself that you did it for the young players at home
I am seeing no Junk Art.  Flick is more of a toy whereas Junk Art is a game.  Highly recommended.  Also, not a fan of the license, but Godfather A New Don is really good!
http://imgur.com/lqOVHkY


I'm like seven months in.
Very nice, i also have a 1 year old collection and we have a lot of game in common !!
Just played mansions of madness for the first time, such a great game.  probably one of the funnest gaming moments ive had.
Noticed you got **Bang: TDG**, **Fuse** and **King Of Tokyo** in your collection. Just asked this in another thread but seeing that you own all 3, you'll probably be best at answering.

Which of the 3 would you recommend to get first? I know eventually I might get the other 2 down the line somehow
Even more interested in Rising Sun now. Seems like a tightly designed game, with lots of decisions.

Having not played Terraforming Mars yet I must admit: the artistic choices in those cards seem terrible! I thought it was only the graphic design that was a bit off (those bright yellows and greens, the silver gradients, etc)  but the pictures/drawings are simply bad.
Glad he picked out **Honshu**. Its a game that I've had since Essen, I wrote about it on [my blog](https://thecraftyplayers.com/2016/11/04/first-impressions-honshu/) and I really enjoy it. Its pretty simple, but not easy for sure! One of my best games so far this year, but that could be because I had no expectations for it.
**Flamme Rouge** sounds awesome. Looking at that setup is seems even more awesome to me. I love the theme.
Someone who can finally sum up how I feel about **Terraforming Mars**. It's a great game. Very well produced. But I don't think I ever want to play it again. I've played it twice now and every time was like the most intense roller coaster ever that during the last half only went down further and further. 
If Paul liked **Honshu** it's a pity he missed **Capital**.
Would be better if it were Paula Deen. Could be promoting a game where the players compete to add the most butter to their recipies, which stangely somehow wouldn't make it into a list of strangest board game themes.
It feels weird that I watched her GROW UP over the past several years.  She was a kid when I started playing board games. 
As a girl in the hobby and a mom of a little girl too - I love that she is growing into her own role at DT, my kids love watching her and it is so nice to have such an honest and genuine voice in the hobby. 
Holy moly, she has grown up fast.
Melody's advice has been invaluable over the years for helping pick games for my kids!

Look forward to the rest of the interview.

It truly is a nice thing to see one's family grow up through our hobby.  She seems like an affable young lady
Nice interview. I think she came across as really friendly and chilled. It'd be great to see more interviews like this.
Well it depends on the price at the time of a B2G1 sale, often they raise prices. B2G1 is only 33% off each game. More often than not CSI, MM, FA have those prices to begin with so shopping with them for Black Friday (or waiting for the multi annual sales) is often better. Now Target having B2G1 sales, and then price matching Amazon can sometimes net big deals. 
Do we know when their B2G1 sale is supposed to start?
It's pretty dependent on what games you buy and the discounts offered I've found. B2G1 means you effectively get a 50% discount on two games, but you can miss out on discounts of greater than that (I think Pandemic is one of those games). I'd say look at the ones you want, if the overall discount works out at more than the cost of the cheapest games, go for it.
I like both games. I think they both get better with more than 2, but neither is bad with 2. Small World tops out at 5, but Waterdeep will play 6 with the Scoundrels of Skullport expansion.

I think Waterdeep is the better choice for you & your husband based on his likes.
Lords of Waterdeep is a much closer fit to the games he currently enjoys as it involves indirect conflict whereas Small World is much more Risk like and combatitive. In addition LOW is based on a Dungeons and Dragons setting that he might be familiar with. It should play 2 well but is much better with 3-4 so if you are planning on playing 2-player the vast majority of the time I would consider looking elsewhere a gateway game designed for two such as 7 Wonders Duel.

The only issue with Lords of Waterdeep is it can feel incomplete and slightly shallow without the expansion in my opinion (it became one of my least favorite to favorite games after getting the expansion which includes both Undermountain and Scoundrels of Skullport). So if you find you like the gameplay but it feels basic or incomplete seriously consider getting the expansion.
I would say Lords of Waterdeep over Small World. 1) I do believe it is easier to teach and play from the get go. 2) It has a much more replay-ability!
I love Lords of Waterdeep, but to play with 6 you also need the expansion and at that player count it suffers a lot. It takes ages and you never feel like your accomplishing anything as progress is so slow. At 2-4 it's great though. I'd suggest 7 Wonders, but I've heard it's not good at 2 and plus you have Sushi Go so you may feel you have your drafting fix. I haven't played Viticulture at 6 but even at 5 it's good. It feels tight instead of infuriating. And it plays well at 2.
I adore Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride. My Dad loves TTR also. We played loads of TTR, some Catan, some Carcassonne. We tried a few games of Agricola too, which we both enjoyed but it is a little heavy and player interaction is limited.

I bought Lords of Waterdeep about a year ago and since then it's pretty much the only game we've played together. It's hard to find any flaws in it really, other than towards the late game there can be quite a bit to keep track of with completed quests and bonuses. You can play very aggressively towards the other players or you can be fairly passive. The quests and leader cards along with way more buildings than you can use in one game make every playthrough unique. I really can't recommend it highly enough. If he is a D&D player too there are instantly recognizable elements (most notably having workers which are Rogues, Fighters, Wizards and Clerics)
With **Lords of Waterdeep**, it's a great intro to the world of worker placement games, which I see that you don't have on your list of games that you own.  It plays 2-5 out of the box, but if you want to play with 6, then you'll need to get the expansion, **Scoundrels of Skullport**.  It contains the pieces for a sixth player, plus two modules which add a lot to the game.  Skullport gives you extra spaces and quests which provide oodles of resources and points -- essentially, it's like the base game, but on steroids.  Undermountain introduces corruption into the game, which is a brilliant mechanism that turns LoW from a good intro game into something special.  It adds a little bit of complexity to the game, so you're probably better off without the expansion at first unless you absolutely want to play with 6 players.  Play the base game first, make sure you like it, and then the expansion is absolutely recommended.

Most of the complaints about Waterdeep have to do with its theme, which feels pretty pasted on.  If your husband is a DnD fan, though, he'll probably love it -- there's a lot of flavor there for fans, although you certainly don't have to be familiar with DnD in order to play the game.

**Small World** is also a good option -- it feels like a non-dice version of Risk.  It's easy to learn, but it maxes out at 5 players, so if you're looking for something that will work with 6, then it's a no-go.  It's a good game, but if your husband is a DnD fan and enjoys games like Ticket to Ride, Kingdom Builder, and Carcassonne, I'd suggest going with **Lords of Waterdeep**.  It's a great introduction to the world of worker placement games, and it probably plays better with just two players.

(As a side note, you mentioned picking up **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** -- this is an amazing game!  It's more complex than anything else on your list, though, so you'll want to take your time and be patient with it.  The basics of the game are pretty simple -- buy a room, place the room somewhere it can fit, score points and bonuses -- but there's a bit of a learning curve with all of the details, and there's a decent amount going on.  It's not difficult to learn by any means, but it's certainly a step up from the other games you mentioned.)
As many others in this thread have already said, LoW is probably going to get you the most bang for your buck. 

If you're ever in the market for a game that more people can sit around as they drink beer and casually play, Small World might be the one to pick up. 
I have both - 

Lords of Waterdeep has a lot more replayability. Take out the mandatory quest cards if you are playing with 3 or more players and then there isn't a large mechanism for kingmaking, which is something many gamers grow to dislike. It's a fun game that has much more depth than Small World if you are playing with more than 2 people.

Small World - our house rule for this game is that points are all gained via open information and thus are not kept secret - is a fun game where the main mechanic is ranking the value of the ability/race combination (These combinations differ in value depending on the stage of the game), figuring out whether to attack the leader or to maximize your own points, deciding when to retire your race and pick a new one (forfeiting that turn) and then the simplistic politics in trying to convince people that you are not actually winning. This game has a lot more depth as a 1v1 game.

Edit: Despite what others have said, both have 6 player options if you buy certain expansions.

If he really likes Munchkin then Small World might be a better fit, though I am hesitant to fully recommend that game because the end game kingmaking (When a losing player picks who wins between 1st and 2nd place players) can grow quite tiresome.
LoW is really easy to learn. I've run total newbies through the rules while playing. I love it.
As a former MTG player I really got into Dominion (building a deck of combos, can get competitive really fast) and 7Wonders (drafting) both are card games. I also like Smallworld, very easy rules, colorful and funny combos but it is nothing like a card game. Haven't played it with two players, 3-4 I think is best. Haven't played Lords of W, although worker placement games are also very interesting.
Your group and games you've played and enjoyed sounds almost identical to mine, including our backgrounds! Just this week, our two newest games were **Small World** and **Lords of Waterdeep**. On the first pass, we liked both of them a lot, but if we could only pick one it'd probably be **Lords of Waterdeep** since it was really unlike the other games we owned(which are all similar to the ones you own). Especially since you have **Risk**, which we don't have, **Small World** could take a bit of a back seat.

Since our collections and interests seem similar, I feel like I should point out another popular game in my collection, **7 Wonders**, and the 2-player variant, **7 Wonders: Duel**. The game scales very well, and while only duel will work for two players, they are both amazingly fun and two of our favorite games.
Well since you don't seem to have a game with worker placement mechanics and also because **Small World** fell flat with the people I played it with (too light, not enough going on/decisions) I have to recommend **LoW**. 
I love LoW and it's been a favorite my friend group for years. I find it enjoyable with 2, but the more players the better in my opinion.

Just got 7 wonders duel a few days ago (tracked it on amazon) and LOVE it. A quick and fast paced game, it's one of my favorite games I've played so far.

That being said, you should look into Castles of Burgundy! It is a very fun game (up to 4, but I think best with 2) and very replayable. Also it involves dice (but not that RNG), so that was a cool mechanism.
Lords of Waterdeep is just an amazing game. Fantastic worker placement with great replayability and flavor. It is a good entry to the worker placement genre.

Small World is great, but honestly it is more of a kids game with no real strategy. 
I love playing Lords of Waterdeep with my SO. It's a great game even at 2 players, as it is really fast with little down time this way.
LoWD. SmallWorld, I've had forever. It just bugs me. I don't ever want to play that game. It's fine. It's just, you either think a lot and score as many points as you can, wasting everyone's time and being annoying. Or, you dig into the theme and just do whatever crazy shit you want and have fun. Either way, at the end, it's eh. 
If you have a tablet or smart phone, you can buy either one for roughly $5-6 and try them out for yourself.  I've owned both and really preferred Lords but after buying the app for Smallworld I really like that game as well.  There was a surprising amount of set up involved with Smallworld and letting the app handle it really made a difference. 
They're both excellent games, and both play well with 2. I think Small World is probably the better 2-player game, though.

That said, Small World really needs an expansion or two to increase the variety; Lords of Waterdeep's expansion is excellent, but entirely optional.

Otherwise they both fit your criteria very well, and you'll probably be quite happy with either.
Depends. If you think the theme will help you get it to the table more often then yeah, might be worth it. Otherwise, no. 
I am a HUGEEEEEEEEEE A Song of Ice and Fire fan, but it's gotta be Cosmic all day! 
Got both. They are actually pretty different. Hostage taking and cashing in mixes it up and speeds it a long. However cosmic is still more fun
Cosmic has a lot more variety and getting it to the table is almost always fun.  But Iron Throne had a deeper strategy to it, and it makes each individual choice feel like it's hitting a lot harder.  They have very similar mechanics, but the difference is real and noticeable.  It honestly depends on if you want the more tactical game with less variety, or the one that has the card that lets you swap chairs with someone right as they're about to win. 
Just get Cosmic Encounter.  Iron Throne will be forgotten within a year.  Cosmic will live forever.
Lots of Cosmic fans probably posting without having played Iron Throne. It's difficult to imagine looking at anything else after investing in lots of CE expansions. I was the same but then a friend bought Iron Throne. It is really brilliant and offers a quicker playing, less confusing for newcomers, more thematic version of a classic. Get the one which you can picture your friends wanting to play, for me it's Iron Throne, am going to sell my Cosmic collection.
> I don't play the game that often anymore but I love the system.

If the problem is getting it to the table, this is a question for those with whom you'd be playing. I'm told GoT is a little less chaotic and random, which might attract new players, but may not be enough Not Cosmic Encounters to pull people from what's being played instead.
Just get any other game that exists, rather than Munchkin-in-space.
How do people with hundreds of games remember the rules for all of them? Don't you have to refresh yourself with the rules every time you play?
I would like a sticky or large post detailing maybe some entry level games for each major style and what the differences are in those styles. For example, I am relatively new to the board game scene and have played a few major ones. I have carcassone, 7 wonders, dominion, and a few others I just bought in the sales this week. The problem with all of this is that I am shooting in the dark on the type of game it is and what style they are. I am not exactly sure what I like the most, but if the information about the styles was available then I would be a more conscientious consumer and maybe not waste some money on games that are not my type. For example, I am not really big on matching type games, but I like a limited amount of luck. So euro-style games are ok. But which ones are easier to access? (I only figured out Euro games were good for me by trial and error, and I would have known that sooner had I knew what they were from the beginning)

The biggest problem I have is that when I ask for advice, it is all over the place and the mechanics are also everywhere. Maybe this is too big of a project for someone that is well-versed in all of this, but it would be a good sticky post.

Edit: And the wikipedia articles kinda suck.
Normally my family and I play **Pandemic** together. This year, I'm going to be staying with my boyfriend's family for Thanksgiving, though. I'm hoping to introduce them to lots of great games that will fit their existing tastes as traditional playing card gamers - **Arboretum**, **Skull**, and **Beyond Baker Street**, among others.

As a related question, what's everyone's experience with **Samurai Spirit**? It's one of my favourites, which I'll also be bringing, and I've only ever played it 2p and 1p. My boyfriend and I normally play on Hard mode, and by ourselves, so we're not sure which mode to play with newbies, which Samurai we should play as, etc. Also, while we feel that it is a simple puzzle with 2, will it become too unwieldy for newbies to follow at higher counts?
I haven't played Splendor but am considering purchasing to play with my family. Do you think my 7 year old could play and enjoy this?
I've been curious as to how "fun" playing solo is for games that are usually played by multiple people (examples: Space Alert, Robinson Crusoe, Suburbia, Terraforming Mars, etc.) I'm asking and mentioned those examples because I'm going to be shopping for those games this weekend and plan on mostly playing solo since I don't really have anybody to play with. FYI I'm new to this type of board gaming and only own Dominion and Pandemic if that helps at all
My family is mostly athletically-inclined so they don't play games often, but **Bang!** and **Codenames** have both been hits at our recent family parties!

And my question: what do you do in **Race for the Galaxy** when the draw pile runs out? Unless I'm missing something the rule book doesn't state anything, and a Google search just found more confused players. For now we've been playing to just shuffle back the discards but that kind of hurts the security that comes from discarding your opponent's ideal 6 cost safely
Where is u/Lazarus1209 ????????????
In **7 Wonders: Duel** do you have to take an action with the card you draw on your turn? I don't know that it would make sense to keep it in your hand rather than buy it, sell it or use it to build a wonder because I've only played the game once, but the rule book seemed unclear on this point and I wasn't sure what to do.
I just picked up Pandemic Legacy for my wife and I to play. I was just looking for things I might miss during our first play and whether or not to play as 2, 3, or 4 characters. 

What say you?
**7 Wonders** - Is it okay for some players to play the A side of their wonder board and other players play the B side in the same game? If you can, is this recommended or is it too imbalanced?
Due to a highly successful birthmonth, together with a sale-filled November, I'm sitting at 30 unplayed games/expansions. For some reason, there are still games I want to buy. I bought games I don't ever think I'll play. 
Has anybody tried the expansion to **Oh My Goods!**? At €14, I'm a little wary of buying it without hearing some more views on it. Aside from the campaign cards, do the other cards add much to the game?
What are some games that are satisfying and enjoyable even if you don't win, like Tickets to Ride where it's satisfying to complete your routes?
As an Aussie, is it worth checking out Black Friday deals? Or does shipping pretty much ruin it? 
hey everyone, I'm new to the hobby and enjoying deck builders quite a lot.

Which expansions are the most interesting and unique for Ascension and Star Realms without throwing the balance off to much? (I have both base games with no expansions thus far)
I've played BANG! twice (the card game, not the dice game). Both times I felt like the game played itself. I couldn't see any reason to do anything beyond "attack a person who is not on your team, within range, who has the lowest health remaining" (edge case: If you're a bandit and your partner has 1 health left, kill them so you can draw the extra cards, instead of letting the other team get them).

The hidden roles don't seem to come into play much, as the non-bandit roles can't risk shooting the sheriff to disguise themselves. The extra damage can mean the sheriff dies prematurely, and even if they don't, the sheriff might now waste time shooting an ally. The bandits should avoid shooting each other, for a similar reason.

Enough people really like this game that I feel I must be missing something. Can anyone share with me some ways that the game has more depth than I'm seeing?
My game group loves cosmic encounter.  What would be some other games you think they might like?
In Power Grid, when a person buys enough cities to trigger phone 2, does phase 2 start immediately or at the beginning of the next round?

Basically, can you immediately begin building in the 15 spots or do you have to wait until the next round?
Has anyone played **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**? Any thoughts/feelings about it?

Thinking it might be a good gift to buy for Christmas.
I've been waiting for Ascension Year Three CE to come out to get it as a gift, but no one really seems to know if/when that's happening. [This site](https://www.acdd.com/ascension-year-three-ce.html) came up on my latest search looking for any news, and it says the release date is December 12th. Anyone know if this is legit? The official Ascension site has nothing about it, which leads me to believe it's not true, yet the box art is pretty convincing. 
I went to a small mini figure convention, they were playing xwing, warhammer etc.

I tried one very simple game with my 5 years old son, rules were very easy and we played on a grid kind of terrain.

I'm wondering if there is a place I could download this kind of map.
Seriously, how do you navigate BGG? It has the front end of a bad 90's site. Where do I even start?
Should I get lorenzo il Magnifico now or wait for the CMON reprint? Doubt there's abroad aesthetic changes. Worried about price hike as currency in country is pretty weak.
With Christmas coming up, any good party game recommendations to play with friends and family?

I've already bought The Resistance and Codenames. Any other good ones I should check out?
With Black friday here, as someone living in Finland and not having the time to browse the Internet for deals. I have a few questions.

1. Are all the games in Amazon.de german? I feel the site has very sloppy english translations.

2. Do other places in europe have free shipping? (Amazon.de offers free shipping for 39e and over)

3. Everything in Finland is effing expensive, where do you fellow europeans but your board games? Or look for deals? Without being overwhelmed by high shipping costs. As a student with 2 kids, money is usually tight.
I'm flying to Australia with my mom during christmas and will have a lot of time on the plane and the airport. I'm looking for some good travel games that's good with 2 players. Do you have any suggestions?  
I usually bring a game to my mom's place when I visit, and what they've liked so far is **Ticket to Ride**, **Carcassonne** and **Dixit**. They however thought that Tokaido was too much going on.
Edit: phone replied in wrong thread and won't let me delete it. 
In Jaipur, what happens if you run out of coins and still have the cards for a particular good? 
In galaxy trucker, if I tie the slavers, do I still lose the space days, or only if I beat them?
What are the differences between Sushi Go and Sushi Go party? Is it just the number of cards so you can play with more people?
I recently got a hold of Myth. How important is it to get the 2.0 upgrade pack, or is just printing the 2.0 rule-set sufficient to play? I looked at the megacon games website and $10 US seems pretty reasonable, but the cheapest shipping option was an additional $51 US which is more than I originally paid for the game.
Is it okay to print copies of games you've bought? Just wondering, as I just bought some new card games and am worried they will wear out over time.

I know Card games aren't that expensive, but for a student, every $20s is a lot; even more when I sleeve the games.
What's the game displayed at the top?  Looks really cool.  (if you don't see it, it looks like it's set in space with lines connecting systems a la Final Fantasy X's skill graph).
Question about Roll For The Galaxy: Why can't you put goods on grey worlds?  What is the thematic explanation behind this?

Not important, I just want to know :)
Does anyone play Agricola solo? Have you played both the normal and revised edition? I'm thinking of getting Agricola primarily for solo and maybe 2p (once a month at the most), wondering if the 50% smaller deck size in the Revised impacts solo play and decision making or not.
Can I ask a /r/boardgames related question; How can I get a user flair??
I am looking for a game to get my girlfriend for Christmas and I am looking for some recommendations given some parameters.

- I want something fairly inexpensive (~$30 or less)
- Not a lot of pieces or is a card game
- Is fun with two players
- Is not super complex
- Doesn't take over 45 minutes to play
- Preferably, the theme is cats or sushi or even anything with cute artwork

I know the theme is a bit weird, but I a pretty sure I have seen some interesting games involving cats and/or sushi, but I don't recall them myself.

Thanks for any recommendations! 
Starting my first board game ever along with my girlfriend(her first as well) tomorrow. Picked up Eldritch Horror & the Forsaken Lore expansion. Anyone have any tips/suggestions/things to expect or do?
I recently bought Risk: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition for my girlfriend from someone online. It wasn't in manufacturer packaging (didn't expect it to be) and me being the clean freak I am, I want to clean it all up before giving it to her. How can I clean the little plastic pieces, dice, and cards without damaging any of them? I was thinking of placing the plastic figures in a bowl of water with a drop of Dawn but I'm afraid it'll damage the plastic.
Are there any games you guys play that aren't from America? And I'm sorry that I assumed you guys are from here if you're not :(. Anyway do they have translated instructions? Are they interesting? Things like that.
That sounds awesome 
Looking for a game for my brother to play with his friend when they're on vacation. They both like the games Pandemic, Betrayal at the House on the Hill, and Settlers of Catan. I'm thinking I would want to get them a strategy game considering what they like to play. They also like to play in groups, so recommending at least 2 player board game. Any suggestions?    
    
    
    
EDIT: Been looking at Eldritch Horror, opinions on this game for them? 
Is Betrayal on the hill easy to learn/teach, thinking for some Christmas gaming with the family? Already have TTR and just thinking of alternative games
Somewhere between too many and not enough.
are you guys serious?i own 4 games.

:(
1630 games, 1317 without expansions, though this does not count duplicates like the many X-wing miniatures.

X-wing miniatures are likely the costliest game. Though PitchCar or Robo Rally would be costly non-miniature choices. 

I am currently working on a list of games to sell so hopefully the collection will be a few hundred games smaller by this time next year.
The answer to this questions is always "One shy of reaching my perfect collection size."

54 base games and 19 expansions.

Unfortunately I can't say I scored any amazing discounts or finds. Almost all were full price.
I own about 340 games without expansions... and it's too many for how often I play. Of that count, I'd say about 30-50 of them are sitting on the chopping block, waiting to be traded, though half of those likely won't trade at all. 

I played a lot of games back when my collection was 0-100 games - maybe 3-5 a week. At around 150-200 games, we had a baby, and suddenly, our gaming time disappeared. I now play a lot of solo games, and my wife and I do games during naptime on weekends. Despite this lack of playing, my collection continued to grow. 

I'm just hoping the game *playing* returns as my son (now two years old) gets older and becomes more independent... and also, if he takes an interest (which he seems to be developing already). Then my 340 will seem validated, somehow. :)

I buy a lot of wargames and big heavy euros, so $100 for a game is not unusual. Most valuable in my collection? Maybe the **Glory To Rome Black Box**, or **Puerto Rico 15th Anniversary**, or **Catan 15th Anniversary Wood Box.** I've got a few other OOP titles, but they often come back into print eventually. 
I own 7 games. 
My collection hovers around 100. 100 is my cap, if I want a new game one has to go...

**How many games do you own?**

80 with 6 incoming...

**Biggest investment?**

Space Hulk. Got the 3rd for 75$ and now countless hours of painting plus the cost of paints.

**Best bargain find?**

Power Grid for 20$ and Space hulk for 75$


I don't really need to go too crazy buying games as we split purchases around my gaming group.
I have like 13. bought like half of those this last week. I hardly get to play any though. My friends all have ADD and can only play games with instant gratification and loud noises. 

My most played is GoT Risk because it's the only one my friends will be patient enough to learn. Just got Blood Rage delivered to my house today, so maybe I can convince them to play that 
66 I like a smaller well curated collection rather than walls and walls full of games i never play. 
My collection is sitting around 400 right now (including about 85 expansions).  Space is getting to be an issue so I am seriously considering a major purge soon.  Best bargain find was the original Warhammer Quest board game with an add-on (all 99% complete) for $12.99 in a thrift store. A good chunk of my collection is thrifted so all those kind of qualify too. Nothing stands out as a huge investment although my small X-wing and Armada collections cost a lot! 
I peaked at around 80 games and I now sell games that I don't love so my collection sits at around 30 or 40. 

I haven't really bought expansions since my Catan/7 Wonders days (I did buy the PA/UK map of TtR because I love share games. Also I've bought lots of LCG and CCG packs.

Biggest investment is Netrunner and the W:Invasion LCG.

I mostly buy stuff second hand these days. K2 and Dragons Gold were both really cheap and great games. Also my painted copies of Battlelore 2 and Black Fleet were pretty good deals.

I made a copy of San Juan with My Little Pony for my daughter and it really got me into graphic design. I recently worked on a version of Secret Hitler to mock my friend
Somewhere between 150-200, I have slacked updating my BGG account. 


Best investment would be Tanto Cuore, it gets so much love here. My mom even plays it.


Biggest investment would MTG.


Grimslingers on sale at the local FLGS after it went OOS everywhere else, I almost paid over MRSP online the day before.
* 30 Games
* Food Chain Magnate ($120). I bought it when I re-sold some event tickets for a $400 profit. I blew all that money on board games instantly. got FCM, Kemet, Dark Moon, all 5 Cosmic Encounter expansions, and Caverna with it.
* Pandemic ($12 at Walmart with discounts a year or so ago)
* DnD I suppose - I haven't tried making any of my own! Although iI'd like to make some Love Letter versions with different IPs :)

>How many games do you own?

BGG says I have 301 with 183 being expansions. More of that 301 is likely to also be expansions though because sometimes BGG lists expansions as separate games.

> Biggest investment?

**Zombicide**. I have spent more money than I want to know on this series of games.

> Best bargain find?

I..... have no idea. Nothing really stands out, likely since the second hand stores around me never seem to get donated anything interesting. Something that was even more disappointing when I was LARPing.

> Proudest homemade version of an existing game?

Haven't done any home made versions of games, but I am very proud of all the [things I've made](https://boardgamegeek.com/files/boardgame/all?username=ScaperDeage) to improve the ones I have.
Current games in my library:

* Takenoko
* Ticket to Ride (plus Nordic Countries XPac)
* Pandemic
* Android: Netrunner
* Way way too much Magic: the Gathering

Not many games in my library but I absolutely adore all of them and my Magic habit may be the reason I haven't branched out to more games yet, lol. 

I just passed 2500 games, not including expansions.  Two years ago at this time I had about five.  Don't let this happen to you...
About 400-450 right now.  It varies.  I have a copy of **Zopp** and a crokinole board, those were pretty pricey, but surely not as much as every **Dominion** expansion.

My best bargain find was a $5 copy of **Yacht Race**, which I eventually sold for 30x that.
Right now I have 53 unique titles. Including expansions and promos I'm at over 200 owned. I've downsized over 100 influding expansions.

My biggest invesment is tough. Single purchase? Probably my Muzzie's Crokinole board. Collectively? Netrunner or Dominion, although that will change when I kickstarter Kingdom death. Single board game? Food Chain Magnate.

Best deal was Key Largo sealed for $4, or maybe the first half of netrunner for 150.

The only home made version I've made was Skull to prove a point.
75-ish, I rarely buy expansions. 

Biggest investment, hands down, is **Myth** - $400+. Still not sure if I will be playing it...
I have 28! The most expensive individual game was Betrayal at House on the Hill, but I have 4 versions of Ascension so that's more I guess. 
* **26** - My bgg "owned" list just grew to 30 games, including expansions, not including classic board games (Risk, Monopoly, etc) and family type games (Life, Alias, Headsup, etc). I still get harassed by ppl in my group about how many games I have ("SO MANY"), but they're perfectly ok coming over to my house and playing my games.

* Biggest investment: **Firefly: The Game** with some extras. No regrets. I love this game. 

* Best bargain deal: last week I got a used copy of **Starcraft:TBG** for $66 plus shipping. Proud to say it's complete and I'm trying to rein in my obsession to complete the set. 

I plan on making a DIY **Hive** set soon using wood burning tools to cut the faces, but otherwise haven't been in the hobby long enough to start any DIY projects. 

edit: formatting
- 76 unique (14 of which have expansions).  
- So far, biggest investment has been **Dawn of the Zeds: Third edition** at $90.  
- Best bargain: **Mechs vs Minions** by far.  
- I've done a few DIY projects to make extra wood game pieces, but my proudest has been an English translation of **Glory to Rome** using Igor Wolski's existing artwork.  I'm hoping I can find a good Black Friday deal on printing so I can finally get my set printed.
* 29
* **Mansions of Madness: Second Edition** - This was my very first board game ever. I picked it up from GenCon this past August for MSRP ($110 with tax). Would I pay that much for it today? No. But considering that was what kickstarted my interest in the hobby, it may have been the best money I've ever spent.
* I got **Agricola**, **Power Grid Deluxe** and **Takenoko** for $70 from Craigslist.
* I have the print and play of **Mottaini** that I still want to try. It's not included in my game count. 

100 - Just hit it yesterday, and I intend to cull my collection here. 1 in, 1 out. 
Biggest investment is X-Wing. About $1500 there. Bargain find, I'd consider some of my trades to be the best. Namely, trading an old Lego set for some games, including twilight Imperium, which has easily produced more hours of play than anything else I own.
46 including expansions.  I started last year.  I will probably stop when I reach 80. 

But who am I kidding?  lol
I have 37, with 11 expansions. Keeping it to 40 main games

Biggest investment is probably **Ticket to Ride** with two big boxes and one map expansion.

Best bargain was **Spyrium** for £12, sold it on for £21...

I have **Win, Lose, Banana** and **Coin Age** homemade.
Well, BGG has me at 1141 unique games and 94 expansions and it seems like I'm always running into games I never logged to BGG.  I also have 4 crammed shelves in the basement with duplicates/parts copies/gift games so the total is around... 1600? Give or take. 

Ok, my keyboard was dying and I had to recharge the batteries. 

My biggest investment apart from my kickstarter table and shelves is probably Krosmaster Arena at around $120 or less.  Even with as many games as I own, I don't believe I've gone over $100 for another individual game + expansions. 

My best bargain?  As a thrifter the illusion of picking up a new hobby game for $1 seems great, but you end up paying in gas and time.  That being said, my $5 Dune or any of the $1 games I knocked off my wish list are hard to pin down as a bargain. 

I haven't really done much PnP or such so I only have a half finished copy of Dune and a ton of Yahtzee Jr sticker dice. 
I live in a one bedroom apt. My board games are on the top shelf of my bedroom closet. [I am legitimately scared that the shelf won't hold up much longer.](http://i.imgur.com/2azfT9j.jpg)
I own two. Legendary encounters: Alien a deckbuilding game and race for the galaxy. 

Biggest investment was legendary encounters. though I have to admit, the game has been a massive hit in my little group. So worth every euro.

Other questions aren't applicable yet I guess.
My group collectively owns ~110, we kinda just pool them together. Probably 40 of those were bought by me.
I tend to stay right around 75 games -- sometimes over, sometimes under, but 75 is about equilibrium.

Biggest investment is probably Imperial Assault at $225ish ... which I've played exactly twice.  On the same day. After those plays, I bought all of waves 1 and 2, plus a Go 7 Gaming insert, and haven't played since.

Best bargain would involve a couple flips I did, thanks to a well-stocked local shop and some leftover copies of things at GenCon.
78 boardgames thanks to the addition of Grand Austria Hotel and Great Western Trail yesterday. So much for "no buying games until after Christmas"!  
58 expansions. Sweet beets! That seems high but includes all the Cosmic Encounter expansions, all but one of the Dominion and Marvel Legendary expansions, and a butt load of Talisman.  
Sadly very few bargain finds, aside from a few finds in my FLGS ding and dent section.
Total collection is 104. We actively play  (at least 1 play every 2 months if not more often) 54 of them. Another, 11 of them are small box versions of some of those 54. 

The small box versions are for when we travel. The rest get played maybe once per year and are lighter games that we got when we first got into the hobby.

Biggest investment was probably Lignum which cost about $120 to get shipped when we got it. 

Best bargain was Panamax which we got for $30.

No home-made versions of games in our collection.
Your Goodwill store must be way more interesting than the ones around here.
I currently own 50 boardgames not counting expansions and old CCGs that I don't play anymore. 
The biggest investment is my Descent 2e collection, best finds I think have been "Il Vecchio" for 10€ and "Snowdonia" for 15€, both new.



85 without expansions (although I'm trying to get rid of 4-5 of them). I've sold/traded 37 so far.

I think I spent the most on Roads and Boats or 1889 (about $100 each).

I've only made one game -- Rolling Stock, hopefully will play that this weekend.
Last I counted I was at about 130 - not including expansions. If I did include them there would only be a few I think. There are a few that I have that I don't usually count, though like multiple copies of the same game re-skinned.

Then again the amount of games I HAVE ACCESS to with other friends and people at my gaming group, I'm sure breaks 300.
Just starting to get into modern board games, my modest collection is just 16 games with 9 expansions. Plan to get 3 more games with 1 expansion this Christmas
Probably 30-40 games, haven't counted them in a while. Plus I'm not sure I have them all in one place for me to count.

Biggest investment is probably Galaxy Trucker, the release with all expansions included. I do have Dark Souls backed on Kickstarter which will be more expensive. When it comes to biggest in terms of actual size it'll probably be the monstrous box for Gloomhaven sometime early next year.

I haven't hunted for bargains for games so I don't have many I've bought during sales and such. I did get Core Worlds at half rice, that's probably the one I've saved the most money on.
407 plus 8 preorders/KS's.

I have Dark Tower that's worth somewhere in the vicinity of $300. Also have Talisman 2nd edition with all expansions that come up to about $300.
I have 53 with the most expensive being put in to settlers of catan with the base game, 2 expansions, and 3 5-6 expansions. Best bargain find was finally getting a copy of spyfall for 9 dollars at target by price matching it with amazon and getting 30% off plus 5% off.
* Total games owned: 262, 222 excluding expansions
* Biggest investment: [Catan 3D Collectors Edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17419/catan-3d-collectors-edition)
* Best bargain find: I only buy my games new, mostly online. Not much of a bargain hunter here.
* Proudest homemade version of an existing game: Never made any custom games, but I created a foamcore insert for Gold West that I am really proud of.


* Own about 30 games without expansions. 
* Biggest investment probably has been kingdom death monster with it being the best bargain find with all shrink wrapped everything : core game + dragon king + gorm + kickstarter rewards + extra models for 725$.  
Ive got a gabd total of 3, but two in the mail now. Trying to get into the hobby now. Most played and most expensive so far is catan. 
Around 80 without expansions. If I don't start playing some of them though I'm going to have to thin the herd a little.  I've slowed down on buying a lot but still can get caught up in the hype sometimes. I'm trying to stick to getting games I know I'll play frequently nowadays. 
When you update your bgg list does it add expansions into the total?  So for a true base game count you need to subtract the expansions from the total?
10 big box, 9 small, and maybe 4 expansions. I get damn good use out of them.

I customise; so I've stuck about £120 worth of Lego into my copy of Dead of Winter (although strictly it only cost me £45 - I already had a lot!) and hours into painting stuff.

Best bargain was a good-as-new copy of Arctic Scavengers + Recon for £18, rather than £30. 

Going to be merging with girlfriend's collection in the next month or so - wish me luck!
Own 140 including expansions, gotten rid of another 140 over the years. Whittled it down to games I really love.

https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/wery67564?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1
* About 150
* Star Wars: Armada. I have...a substantial collection. Getting into Age of Sigmar though, so I imagine there will be a new champion in that category pretty soon.
* Free? Someone gave me a copy of Imperial Assault NIS because they didn't want it. I don't want it either. I haven't figured out who to gift it to yet. Probably my brother in-law or I'll leave it as an awesome thing for someone to stumble on at the Goodwill.
* I should be more creative. I've never done this.
Around 36 last time I checked. I purge often. I only want games that get played often on my shelf.
For those with a large collection... I'm looking for Descent 2nd edition expansion (I have Wyrm) :)
81 Games, 35 expansions. Kingdom Death is by far my biggest investment at close to $1000. Best bargain is hard when you live in norway, but I consider everything bought in the US and brought home as a bargain. Only home made I got are inserts.
20-25. I don't remember the exact number. And I have 3 games pre-ordered/kickstarted, if that counts.

I just started buying games about three months ago, and I'm desperately trying to avoid the kind of sale binging that certain friends of mine have fallen victim to. I have one friend who owns more than 200 games, and has them lovingly displayed on shelves in his basement. It's an impressive sight, but I want to cry when I think about how much it must have cost.
* Own: around 150 including expansions.
* Biggest investment: **Myth** (all-in kickstarters)
* Best bargain: Numerous Target and B&N finds lol.

* Homemade: Not really home made, but I made a "pocket size" **Splendor**; I replaced the chips with various plastic gems and stored the whole game in a Fantasy Flight deck box. ( http://a.co/5wYAWIv )
*How many games do you own?*
A little over 100 now.
 
*Biggest investment?*
Imperial Assault

*Best bargain find?*
Hero Quest for €2,50
Probably about 40-50.  I'm not planning to collect any more for a long time though, since most of mine haven't seen the table more than a handful of times. 
maybe 30? (excl expansions) Pretty happy with that number and looking to only increase it by 1-2 a year. My prize possession? Painted **Cthulhu Wars**. I live in Aus so there are no bargains but I did manage to pick up Cthulhu Wars on ebay for <50% what local stores stock it at.
•How many games do you own? 40 not counting expansions.

•Biggest investment? Eldritch Horror with expansions probably.

•Best bargain find? I once got Descent 2nd Edition for $40 sealed when it was difficult to find and resold it for $100. 

•Proudest homemade version of an existing game? None of note. I'm not crafty.


    How many games do you own?

52 not counting expansions. And haven't bothered to count expansions.

    Biggest investment?

Based on my all in kickstarter pledge I would have to say **Cthulhu Wars**.

    Best bargain find?

I like to think $20 for **Modern Art** was a good bargain since the components were still new and in shrink.

    Proudest homemade version of an existing game?

I've painted miniatures and replaced components for games but not quite sure that counts as a homemade version. So really the only homemade version game I have is **Liar's Dice** because I have so many sets of extra dice I eventually put aside enough of them in a dice bag to use for Liar's dice.

I own about 6 games, and 3 PnP. I mostly play with my SO and we recently discover a few online boardgames website and also a boardgames cafe that have a +50 collection, so that has kept us from picking up new games (1,5 years into the hobbies).

Biggest investment and regret was "Risk: Game of Thrones". Best bargain was Carcassone's expansion (inns & cathedral 40% off). Proudest homemade version was a remake of The Resistance based on the actual political reality of my home country.
I own somewhere between 100 and 150 games. I have played all but a handful of the newer ones and the party games we end up getting as gifts. The most I've spent on a single game is somewhere around $100. I tend not to think about these things too often. I have not been hurting for money and I play regularly every week, more over the holidays, so the games hit the table often enough. Recently, we have discussed trading or donating a few of our older games that we simply do not enjoy playing (such as Pandemic, Quicksilver, Convoy, and Zen Garden).
Currently at 89 games. This does not include expansions or old games from my childhood/early adulthood (Monopoly, Sorry, Trivial Pursuit, etc), that I have stashed away in a closet. These are just the ones that I proudly display on book shelves. 
I own 94, if you include those on the way, not including expansions. It's more than I need, fewer than I want, but also more than I really want to have. If I get rid of all the games I don't really have any desire to play, I'd probably be down to somewhere in the 70s.

My biggest investment was either **Wiz-War** and expansions, **Warrior Knights** w/ expansion, **Bruges** w/ expansion, or **Merchants and Marauders** w/ expansion.

My best thrift store score was a Like New copy of **Power Grid** with the power plants expansion for $3. I've had other notable ones, such as **Carcassonne**, **Around the World in 80 Days**, and a few others. I've had a few thrift store misses too, as I passed by a copy of the 1982-ish version of **Survive**.

Bonus answer: my favorite designer appears to be Feld.
A bunch. I own a bunch of games. Biggest investment has been X-Wing Miniatures by a wide margin. They mostly sit unused in my closet.
Looks like around 204.

Biggest investment.. mmm I'd say probably keyflower + expansions has the highest cost I've put forth.  

Best bargain find.. Last edition blood bowl complete w/both teams for 50 bucks in perfect shape. As well as three copies of I.V edition Glory to Rome for a price I won't list here lols

Haven't done any homemade games
* *How many games do you own?* 635 (409 expansions). Note, there is some Kickstarter items in there that I have yet to receive. [BGG Link](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/Benzy311)

* *Biggest investment?* Tough call between **Cthulhu Wars**, **Kingdom Death**,  **Shadows of Brimstone** and **Robotech RPG Tactics**

* *Best bargain find?* 10 year old me finding a copy of **Space Crusade** that was missing a 1 from the price tag. Got it for $15!!!

* *Proudest homemade version of an existing game?* Still working on a large format version of **Dawn of the Zeds**. It will include a Google Earth of my local town, large bases with Zombicide miniatures to represent the zombie hordes/civilians and the characters will be renamed to my friends.
I own 40, currently. I fluctuate plus or minus one or two but generally hover around that. My biggest investment was probably my Dominion Big Box for $80USD. Best bargain thus far is **Puerto Rico** new, not in shrink for $15USD. I'm not crafty so no homemades for me.
151, not counting duplicates or games with multiple base sets (usually deck builders), with 212 total entries in BGG. In the middle of culling my library so that number should drop by a fair bit as I sell my unwanted games.
Own: Touch over 100,

Biggest Investment : Race Formula 90 or RallyMan, and I want the expansions (for both).

Best Bargain : I guess my $4 (CAD) copy of Scotland Yard.
252 - but (in my defence) theres a lot of small games in there (6 Nimmt and the like)

No game stands ouot as a major investment - I think the most I've spent on a game was either Scythe or the big box of Galaxy Truckers - and neither of them are still in my collection.  

The best bargain tho - was Ra second hand for $25, its now one of my favourite games of all time, and led me to grab the other games in Knizias auction trilogy (Medici and Modern Art).   And if that doesnt strike you as a great bargain, well - its a good price in Australia.  The new version is about $80 here.

A dozen. About half of which I wouldn't replace if I lost them.
Too many....... I used to have a game night every day now it down to 4 a week but still but a lot of games. If your looking to fill your collection, bargain stores like TJ Maxx, Marshalls, Ross, or Ollies isually have a few board games. My best find has to be Dominion at GoodWill for $1.50
ykess an i thought my 19 (26 if you count combine-able stand alone expansions separately) 
by far my biggest investment would be my complete red dragon in (rdi 1-5 (with 6 backed) and all 11 allies and the gambling I'm in deck)
110

Biggest investment Mechs vs minions 
No real bargain finds just cheapest prices on amazon at the time
I have no homemade games either unless painting minis count
1. I own around 130 games.
2. Biggest investment would be Android Netrunner.
3. Best bargain is a tough one, got Gears of War for $26. 
4. Homemade would be my PnP of Barbarian Prince. Clear packing tape laminate on old cereal boxes (I hate crafts). One of my favourite games too.

I have 2 games right now.  I had them before I was interested in board games.  Now I plan to buy some more especially with black friday coming soon.
> **How many games do you own?**

Bgg says I own 166, not counting expansions. That feels a little low to me, though, so I'l have to do an audit to make sure they're all recorded. 

> **Biggest investment?**

Probably our **SmallWorld Designer's Edition**. We did get it as part of the Kickstarter, though, so it only cost us $325.

> **Best bargain find?**

Hm... maybe **Castles of Burgundy** for $17? I'm not entirely sure. Most of our games we get at pretty normal online sale prices.

> **Proudest homemade version of an existing game?**

I haven't really done any full homemade games, but probably my favorite mod is my [**custom "Deluxe" copy of** ***Kingsburg***.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/52gjhe/my_diy_kingsburg_deluxe_edition/)
1. 250+

2. Don't know, probably some giant cmon kickstarter - zombicide, Arcadia quest, the others, etc ... Although Tanto Cuore big box with all expansions costs quite a bit too.

3. World of SMOG for $20 AUD, retails for $140.

4. None.
I've got around 50, but around 35 of those are fillers and short games, and the rest are midweight to heavy euros.
I limit by shelf space, but the shelves hold over 400 games...

Best bargain find has to be [Sharp Shooters](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1459/sharp-shooters), which I bought at a thrift thinking that a buck fifty was a pretty good price for a dice tray and 30+ dice. Turns out to be my favorite yahtzee variant!

I put together a "Dathkadan" set of Merchant of Venus, which cost so much that I think it also counts as my "biggest investment".
I have about 35 games, that includes 2 expansions and a repeat (Sushi Go - Sushi Go Party). 

Honestly I almost don't like having that many. I want to phase it down but I have a weird attachment as well. But I, in almost every other facet of my life, like to shed weight if I do not use something frequently. 

Biggest Investment: **Arkham Horror** Got the main game, Dunwich Horror expansion, King In Yellow expansion and Dark Pharaoh expansion. But I will NOT give those games up. I love them. 

Best bargain: **Five Tribes** at the B&N sale - got it for 20 bucks. Totally love thatgame!

Homemade Version: I love the **Warhammer** universe, 40K and fantasy. I also enjoy D&D but it's hard to play. So currently I have a big barrel of "army men" but they are Fantasy version and Pirate/Skeletons. So I have Archers, Dwraves, Pirates, Skeletons, Witches, and so on. So I am create a basic game of 2D6 skills and rolls. Each character has special abilities, movements, etc. It's actually been really fun creating it!  
Really want to keep it to 40 but have about 80 (and 30 expansion ls+promos). The problem is our 3 player household has very diverse tastes :-)
I got into the hobby maybe around 2007 or so.

[According to my BGG collection](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/beigemore)...

* Games Owned: 33
* Games Previously Owned: 56
* Expansions Owned: 10
* Expansions Previously Owned: 27
* Biggest investment: **Descent 2nd Edition w/ expansions**
* Best bargain find: **Arcadia Quest** for something like $56

I did a pretty big purge two or three months ago when I moved.  I probably got rid of a few games that I shouldn't have (Imperial Assault), but it's nice to have a much smaller list of games.  I got rid of a bunch of games I never played or just didn't like.  Now I'm basically at the point where I keep math trading ones I don't care too much for until I get one I do want.

Here are a few other stats...

* My most played game is **Arcadia Quest**.
* My current favorite game is **Arcadia Quest**.
* My most regretted purchase is **Twilight Imperium**.
* In  my most recent math trade, I traded **Mystic Vale** for **Dead of Winter**.  
* My most recent purchase was **Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**.
* My next planned purchase is **Kingdom Death: Monsters** on Black Friday.
My girlfriend and I bought our first few board games on 22 September 2016. Two months later, as of today, we already have 13 games.

I think we are suffering from some newbie syndrome:(

Edit: Forgot to mention we have 2 games shipping and around 5 games we are planning to buy within a week (when my FLGS goes on sale).
Honestly, too many. I'm not going to count them all right now but probably 50ish. I can probably get 1/4 of them to the table if I really wanted too. Though there  are about a dozen dozen hex and counter war games that I need to learn and are viable. 
About forty, with maybe ten expansions. I've noticed that my buying of board games has started to plateau now that I feel like I have enough diversity to suit most occasions.

Biggest investment in total is dominion, which is amusing considering how over that game I am.  Single purchase would be Tales of the Arabian Nights.
40 games after 2 year in the hobby. I have slowed down considerably over the past year, bought only 5 games. I'm aiming to get max 6 games per year

Reason is the industry is blooming. We can foresee many **better** games with great art and components as publishers have better budget for each game.

That's why i have decided to stop buying games which are more than a few years back, **rather than play catch up to buy good games thats been released over the past 10 years. I know this coming few years will have even better games**. So im saving space and money for future
I simultaneously have too many, yet not enough.
70ish, over 100 with Xwing expansions.
According to BGG, 55 games not counting expansions.  

With expansions, 92.   But that also includes just about every CaH expansion, and a ton of X-Wing ships.
How many games do you own?
Excluding expansions, 171, plus one more pack of cards that are used for Parade, Lost Cities, Battle Line, Hanabi, and Agent Hunter.

Biggest investment?
Probably Massive Darkness, but maybe Arcadia Quest Inferno.

Best bargain find?
The closest would be Glory to Rome, black box. Someone kindly sold it to me for about $30 to $35 USD.

Proudest homemade version of an existing game?
I have two: Noir, which i rethemed to be games/TV/comic/other characters. 
https://www.instagram.com/p/BKA_ORgja5w/

Coloretto, Eeveelution edition. 
https://www.instagram.com/p/BMtkF1fDzHt/
Physical: 1.
Ios App: 20-30 and still counting.
Biggest investment: 20 USD.
Best bargain: ios free period, $0.
Proudest homemade: None
* BGG says 343 unique games, but that's probably a few short in either direction. 32 expansions; I'm not a fan. 
* Most expensive, you mean? That's a three way tie; Napoleon's Triumph, Puerto Rico: Limited Anniversary Edition, and Antiquity all cost me $150.
* I get lots of games donated to me because I run a large game night with a public library.
* **Indonesia**, though my custom **Bus** is also pretty neat. 
My collection is currently 55 games, with only 2 expansions. But I have access to a much wider variety of games through my game group, so there's not need for me to buy as many. If I include games I've played belonging to others it jumps to 141.

Biggest investment is probably the X-Wing miniatures game. It's not much compared to some, but I'd say its coming up on €200. 

Depends on what you mean by best bargain. I picked up **Skull** for half price, €10, and its gotten a lot of play. Same with **Rhino Hero** which cost £6 on Amazon. I guess picking up **Via Nebula** for €25 not too long ago was a pretty good deal, but I haven't had a chance to play it yet.

Edit: I made a small bit if effort with my **Deep Space D-6** print and play. It looks...fine. I don't think I have an answer for the last question. Last year I made a Christmas re-theme of **The Resistance: Avalon**, with one team being Santa (Merlin) and the elves, with the other team being The Grinch, Krampus etc, but it looked kind of crap as it was all free art I found online. And it never got played.
Only 1, which is Mechs vs Minions. I would like to buy some other games like Pandemic Legacy or Gloomhaven, but unfortunately my friends don't have free time together. One friends works in the weekdays and the other one has only time in the weekdays. We only got to the second mission and we had a ton of fun doing that, but that was a few weeks ago and we still couldn't find a time where we can meet up again.
I'm at 397.  I'll be at 400 by the New Year.  There's about 30 sitting in my office that need to be sold/traded though.
I have around 15 games and I'm holding myself not to buy any more until a couple of them have more plays. It's so easy to be tempted to buy everything. I have a big wishlist with games like Lisboa, Terraforming Mars, Viticulture EE, Istanbul and so many others but I have to constantly remind myself that my current games aren't getting played anyway so buying new ones is not ideal.

My biggest investment has been Scythe. 60 euros the game, 30 euros for resources, 30 euros for metal coins, 15-30 euros in promos, 30 euros for the expansion, considering getting the broken token insert...

I haven't caught a great bargain, I buy most my games new from stores. I guess the best would be Jaipur for 10 euros, which was the one game I bought from a previous owner.
263 games plus 48 Expansions totaling to 301.

Biggest investment is Legendary Marvel+Villains+Guardians of the Galaxy+Paint the town red+Aliens

Best bargain find is hard to tell. I got Dominion for 3.49€ used (highest BGG rating for money), I traded a 18€ damaged copy of seasons for a "like new" copy of Arcadia Quest and I got lots and lots of good games for 5€ or three for 20€ at SPIEL in Essen in the last years.

Proudest homemade version of an existing game:

My now fiance once made me a monopoly game with the LARP barony we played in that can be played in character.
* Around 80-100.  
* Around $200 for various kickstarters, including add-ons (I think most for a single game was around $150 - I have Myth, Conan and Deadzone, which I think all were around that price point before add-ons).
* Through the Ages in shrink for 100 kr (around $14). Also, I recently got Twilight Imperium 2nd ed and Descent 1st edition (minus heroes and a couple of monsters) for free when I purchased a used copy of Rampage (now Terror in Meeple City) for 100 kr.
* Don't really have any homemade copies.
I'm probably at around 80-85 main games. 15 - 20 expansions. 

The most I spent on a single game (off of Kickstarter) was Mechs and Minions at £72. On Kickstarter, not much higher tbh - Anachracy maybe?

Best bargain was probably a complete Cyclades for £22 at a UK Games Expo. Xia for £40 is up there though. 

Best return on an investment for me though is probably Discworld Delux Edition. Bought for £40, now sellable for £120. 

I don't look for many games these days. I have a list I'd like to have (Glory to Rome Black Box for example - high on my wishlist), but I've run out of room (with 2 kids) and needed to slow down.
Currently just 19.  A couple of the games with miniatures (e.g. Space Hulk) were around $100.  Don't think I ever got a good bargain, but I did get New England as a free door prize and X-Wing as a gift.   And all of my homemade games were games I created myself, though I guess I do have a homemade version of Go.


Roughly 1,400 games with around 400 expansions to various degrees.  I get into my primary hobbies pretty seriously!  The bulk of the collection has crossed continents twice and survived, but it definitely cuts into my ability to relocate.  I generally only add new games by checking the BGG Top 100 for new entries, or by buying expansions to current games I like, or from very select designers.

The biggest investment has been War of the Ring: Collector's Edition, followed closely by the Small World Designer's Edition.  Both worth every penny and I keep an active eye out for these semi-grail games.

The best bargain find was a copy of Dune for $20 at a garage sale.  Best bargain missed was a copy of Star Wars: Queen's Gambit for $70 at the local game store -- came back a week later and it was gone!

Unfortunately I haven't tried a homemade version yet, although I've replicated Codenames for an office event with a few scraps of paper.
Not enough for me, more than enough according to my wife
About 30. I have two extra teams for Neuroshima Hex 3.0 so I guess it's what I'm most invested in
About 100.

Roads and boats cost €80.

Modern Art I got for £1, which is the best bargain still in the collection. I bought StarCraft NIS for £9 but sold it off. Also a few other rare charity shop fines that got sold off.

Proudest homemade? Maybe my handdrawn copy of fjords or my cloth map for Chicago Express

I'm sitting at 231 not including expansions.  My largest investment is my Carrom board (or at least I assume so - it was a gift).  My best bargain find is Tikal at Goodwill, although I also have a few Bandu sets as well.

I don't have any print and play stuff.  The most treasured game in my collection is The Really Nasty Horseracing Game, as it was my first step into hobby gaming and special ordered from the UK.  A nice big red box with some wonderful plastic horses.  There's something magical about a game that lets you bet the house that you'll *lose* the race.
Currently own 106 games not including expansions. Trying to ditch six of them. Going to try and stick to 100 games. There's a math trade coming up that will hopefully rid me of 8-10 games.

Biggest investment: Bought **Antiquity** used for $200. Currently trying to get all the Splotter games.

Best Bargain: My Essen copy of **American Rails**. I don't know if it was a bargain, but I got it $30, and that to me seemed like a steal. 
Many games
I recently bought my 8 year old niece a copy of Ticket to Ride. It's an excellent gateway game that will teach her strategic/tactical thinking and some US geography as well.
Abraca-what, Oceanos, lotus, kingdomino, karuba, quadropolis for new games. Alhambra, ticket to Ride, patchwork, or qwirkle for older games. Does she have any interests right now that might be a good theme tie in?
I've two kids, 6 and 8 and of all the stuff we have, they seem to like **Cluedo** the best.

We also play **Survice: Escape from Atlantis** a fair bit.
King of Tokyo, Roborally  or Settlers of Catan
My daughters, including the youngest around that age, all loved One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Sushi Go and Forbidden Island.
Played a few times now and it is a great game - IMHO worth the hype.

Still rising up through the ranking at BGG too (currently 31st in terms of overall rank)...
Played it 9 times so far since I got it last month. All solo. Can't wait to play with more but it is still easily in the running for best game I've played all year. Super satisfying when you can win and even when you fall short it provides an excellent experience. 
I played it (and taught it several times) at BGG. I like it a lot - it's a very interesting theme, and there are many potential strategies to get VPs and win the game. It kills Tera Mystica for me. 
I am super excited to get it next year when I can pay a reasonable price for it. I just refuse to pay bloated reseller prices for the new hotness - it's something I really dislike about this great hobby.
It has a take that mechanism and yeah, that's a hard pass most times for me. 
In a resource management game where every bit can matter, it's an even harder pass.
Played once with the starter corporations and had a blast. We did not get anywhere near filling Mars like the image in this review... but aren't the spots reserved for water illegal placements for other tiles? I thought there were more spots than water tiles.
I agree with this glowing review, but I'm a little worried about someone only playing the game twice and writing a review.  Shouldn't it be played more to get a spot on G&S so the review can go into more depth?
Anybody have much experience playing it with only two players? I'm curious to know how well it scales between all player counts.
We've only played it once, but it was pretty popular with my playgroup. 
I'm really excited to get my hands on this. I did find one copy at a FLGS for $60. Probably gonna just wait until Jan/Feb though to save ~$15.
Lots of love for this game
Love this game!
Didnt really do it for me, but I only played once.  5 of us, just reading our own cards, adjusting production levels up and down.  I have no problem with the theme, although the slightly dodgy art didnt help sometimes.  Just not my thing I guess.
Any word on the reprint in the US?
I thought it was interesting he compared it to the Mars Trilogy..

I red 2/3rds of Red Mars before I gave up, I thought it was a dreadfully boring book with zero interesting characters. Nothing interesting at all happened, all the characters were two dimensional, and I frankly couldn't even keep them straight because they were all just so boring. Ugh, what a terrible book.

At any rate, is the game *really* based off that series? or was it simply "inspiration" for the book. Not that it really matters. I hear the game is terrific from a few different sources, so I will most likely pick it up at some point.

I was really interested in the game before release, glad to hear its gone down well. I think I will wait for the re print in the hope they improve some of the components as I heard they are a bit lacklustre.
I liked the card play, but the milestones/awards put me off the game a bit, they're kinda janky additions.

A version of the game with variable awards/objectives where some or all of them are fixed from the start rather than needing to be 'activated', would be fantastic for me.
This game's systems looks super fun, but honestly the graphic design of this game completely puts me off, when I saw the hacker card on SU&SD's post of it on their blog that was released today (yesterday?) I almost completely put this on my pass list.
"Organised Play" sounds like a boring play date your mum organises with the boring kid next door.
I strongly suggest **Kemet.**

First off, the combat is excellent and the game rewards being offensive over defensive in many ways. The combat is not random, instead each player starts with the same  identical hand of 6 cards with varying levels of attack, shield, and kill. Each time you go into combat up choose a card secretly and discard another. So, you'll have some information on what your opponent still has available. 

You'll also have some situations where you know that it's impossible to hold your territory but that you can gain more by killing a bunch of your opponents armies. Or you may know that you're going to lose but you want to shield your men and come back to attack on your next turn. 

It also has an interesting aspect of building up technologies that give you special powers or break other rules. 

Finally, in terms of a gift, it's a beautiful game. It's Egyptian themed and just... Beautiful. The art is gorgeous, the board, the minis, everything. It would be an impressive gift. In addition, the rules are simple and consistent so if he had not played many hobby board games the rules are not at all intimating.
**Risk: Legacy**, especially if you'd have the ability to promise to play it through with him.

**Spheres of Influence**, which is essentially "better Risk."

**Combat Commander: Europe**, if he likes Risk because he likes warfare/military in general, he may enjoy this. This would be the deepest of the suggested games, so both more intimidating but potentially more rewarding for him. I believe it has a solo mode too, if that would be relevant.
**Nexus Ops** is a very fun, relatively quick, combat focused strategy game. You don't win by holding Territory but by winning battles that you've started so it really pushes constant fighting and aggressive play. Oretty simple and very well balanced with some good catchup mechanics. 
My favorite lighter "dudes on a map" game similar to risk is **Nexus Ops**. It's short and brutal and I've always enjoyed it even when losing. 

If you think he'd want something longer to hell with that "conquer the world" vibe then I'd go with **Shogun/Samurai Swords/Ikusa** (name depends on the edition you get, it's currently Ikusa). This one takes the idea of the "death ball" from risk and formalizes it into armies so you have a general moving around the board and then a player board that shows the army that guy is toting around. As they win battles they can move more times in one round. There's a lot of other differences but that's the big one IMO. 
I'll 2nd the **Kemet** and **Small World** suggestions (slightly leaning Small Worlds if fantasy theme is okay).
Would highly recommend **A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition**.
It's essentially a better risk with a game of thrones flavour to it. Knowing the game of thrones story is not necessary as the game itself is extremely fun and plays well with 4-6players (it also has the option to remove a lot of the luck of risks and make it very skillful and mechanical, or keep the luck of risk with the tides of battle cards).  
Check out /r/agotboardgame
**Small World** is a great game. It is a strategic area control game, like Risk, but is otherwise completely different. It is a much faster moving game. Even though the rules are more complex and is, in my opinion, a better game than Risk, the cartoony nature of the artwork might turn him off for appearing too juvenile. If you can get him to play a few games to the point where he understands the strategy of balancing one *active* and one *in decline* race, it could be a huge success. I feel like Small World is a great stepping stone into better quality board games than mass market stuff.
I would concur with your decision to proceed to Small World. I moved my family onto it and it was a big hit.
Someone else already said it but IKUSA
**Axis and Allies** is my suggestion if he wants something much heavier, while still playing something almost exactly like **Risk**. 
Maybe memoir 44 would fit the bill? 
Idk, what does he seem to like about both? Does he have any other games? How into the hobby is he? Any other details at all?   

My initial response was memoir 44 for something between full on conflict logistics and risk light strategy dice chucking, and modern/realistic theming.    
**Imperial**, or the newer **Imperial 2030**, is probably a smaller step from Risk than Smallworld, but still adds enough strategy depth to be interesting. Smallworld, though, has some random bits of setup that significantly add to replayability.
Warrior Knights is a great multiplayer strategy game with some interesting Euro elements. Each turn has four seasons. At the start of each turn you pick some order cards, which have things like gather taxes, move armies, gain religious power etc. and assign two to each season. All players cards for each season get shuffled and you end up with four decks of cards. So you know what you are going to be doing each season but not the order and not who is going first. 

It really gets you to think ahead and be flexible. 
Right now we've got a lot of good "dudes on a map" games to look at. I've heard great things about Cry Havok and Blood Rage. I personally love Inis. Kemet is great. If you play Risk Legacy, I'm sure you'll win some Good Boyfriend points with him.
Going a different direction from the other responses, I'm going to recommend **Eight Minute Empire: Legends.** I often characterize this game as "Risk-lite (except fun)" when introducing to new players. For me at least, it gives that Risk-esque land grabbing feeling, but you can play it in half an hour and it doesn't eat up an entire table and a half--when you combine those two things, something remarkable happens that never did (for me) with Risk: you can get people to agree to play it with you. 
Group therapy.
Quartermaster General, especialy if he likes WW2.
[Forbidden Stars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175155/forbidden-stars) is a really enjoyable strategy "capture the flag" in space. It is on the expensive side though. The rules are fairly straightforward, although combat takes a little bit of working out. Plays well with 2-4 players.
Risk 2210 is fantastic, many seem to consider it the best iteration 
Sorry but a lot of these are bad suggestions. It sounds like he is interested in strategy games but probably doesn't have lots of experience. Conflict looks pretty simple and so is Risk. Some of these games being suggested are pretty big jumps in complexity for inexperienced gamers though. My dad would play Risk but he would never play Kemet for instance.

Small World might work, especially if you are a gamer and can help it along. How about Risk Europe though? It's getting great reviews and can actually play quite well at 2 and 3 players. Star Wars Risk is another great game but only plays 2 player and the theme may or may not work for him. Both those games are fairly easy and are barely Risk games. Risk is really only in the title for marketing purposes I imagine.

My copy of **Trajan** arrived yesterday, and I love it so much.
We popped into our local game shop last week to see if our order of **Memoir 44** had arrived yet. It hadn't, but **Galaxy Trucker** winked at us from the shelf. Couldn't resist its charm. And wow, it is so much fun. 
The most recent one I've played is **Innovation**, and I'm really liking it.
Terraforming Mars. It's got plenty of flaws, but as a game to play with the wife (i.e. just for the table time together and not for any deeply strategic experience), it is a decent enough game.
**Arkham Horror LCG**: absolutely loving it so far. My partner and I played the first scenario as a stand alone, then once through the full campaign with different investigators. The only minor disappointment was that things didn't really go well throughout, and the third scenario beat us up so badly, and we got such bad luck, that we died before anything interesting had really happened. I'm hoping we'll cope a bit better the next time around and get to see a bit more of what it's all about.

**Oh My Goods**: A really neat little card game, with a decent amount of hidden depth due to the multiple card uses. It feels just a little too luck driven to be a classic, and I don't quite get the feeling that'll entirely balance out with experience, but that doesn't stop it being a lot of fun to play.
I haven't played it yet but managed to snag a copy of **Roll for the Galaxy** for $2 at Barnes and Noble, so I'm looking forward to trying it. The cashier girl was impressed that a box with that much product was on sale.

I don't get to play games nearly as much as I'd like, so I'm also still looking forward to trying my copy of **Dead of Winter: The Long Night** I grabbed on sale and my Kickstarter copy of **The Networks**. Hopefully I can strongarm some people into playing around the holidays.

A recent purchase that I did manage to play was **Bohnanza** and it definitely delivered. I studied the game for a while so I was able to manage the unintuitive rule set with two groups of vastly different gaming experience levels. All enjoyed dealing some beans, I'm glad I have it for sure.
**Codenames**, couldn't resist when it was sold for €10.51 on Amazon. I played it before, so I know what to expect. Haven't unpacked my own copy yet.
Last weekend I snapped up a bunch of games from a LGS that's going out of business (sad face :( ). Here's what I got:

* **Dominion: Intrigue (2nd ed)** - Haven't played it yet. I love Dominion though!

* **Machi Koro: The Harbor expansion** - Just played this last night, also with the Millionaire's Row expansion which I already had. I enjoyed it :)

* **Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countires** - I've played the original so many times I've lost count, I liked getting to play on a different map with some different mechanics for a change

* **Nexus Ops** - It was fun, I don't own much in the way of war games, so it's a nice addition to my collection

* **Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn** - Haven't played this one yet either, but it looks like a neat LCG. Love the artwork! 


Captain Sonar, but I literally just purchased when it when in stock on CSI this morning so I don't have it yet, but I'm already planning the game night for it. 
I bought [**Yinsh**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7854/yinsh) about a month ago. It's probably my favorite or second favorite board game depending on how I'm feeling that day. Teaching this game is really easy, as are most abstract strategies, but the depth of this  game is veiled by its simple concept. I've put in about 6 or 7 plays, and every one of them is satisfying. Every time I lose I can remember the things I could've done differently, and apply that knowledge to the games I play later. I consider myself extremely fortunate that I have it in my collection.
**The Great Western Trail** - Played a friend's copy on monday, bought it yesterday. 

I didn't expect much going into it, and we played the first half of the game *horribly* wrong (Skipping the "Fill your hand at the end of each turn" phase makes the game pretty difficult). After we corrected that things clicked, and both me and the wife loved it.
I just purchased an old copy of Zertz. It sits on my shelf unplayed. 
I picked up a copy of **Via Nebula** about 3 weeks ago, but haven't gotten it to the table yet. The rules seem straight forward enough, but work (overtime and some weekend working) really ate into my ability to bring it out and teach. Hopefully soon.
**Secret Hitler** on Kickstarter. It's amazing, a next generation of social deduction games. 

It's magnificently self balancing. If the good guys do really well for the first few rounds, they're in for a really bad time for the next few rounds. The fascist/liberal card ratio mechanic is sheer brilliance. Having just joined the game designer club (successful Kickstarter woo!) and having a degree in math, I'm insanely jealous. 
**7 Wonders**. I've only played the two-player variant so far but it's a perfectly balanced game. My partner and I have each won half a dozen games or so. Looking forward to experiencing it with more players! 
Picked up Patchwork. It's amazing!
I picked up **A Feast for Odin** so my wife could give it to me for Christmas. She decided she wanted to give me a surprise gift instead so I don't have to wait. Game is excellent! 
**The Prodigals Club**. Got it yesterday. Can't say much about how it playes since I did not have a chance to play it yet. It will hit the table on monday I think. I do try to be an educated consumer so I'm pretty sure the purchase was a bullseye just like, for example, **Alchemists** or **Dungeon Petz** before it. CGE is slowly becoming my favorite publisher.
My most recent purchase was 2 copies of ticket to Ride first journeys. One for my god daughter and one for my kids.  10/10 would recommend if you have kids around 6.

Last purchase for me was Vikings on board i think. Also really enjoy it. Totally overproduced but that's fine. It's a very fun very mean game that i think i only really want to play at 4. Three was ok but not as good as four was. There is a surprising amount of dickery in this game. Ive enjoyed it so far. 8/10


Got **Clank!** last week and Didn't get to play it until this last weekend. Played it 3 times in a row and can't wait to get it to the table again. It's awesome fun! My old lady **HATES** Deckbuilders but she was having a great time with this one. It's a winner!
Got **Dead of Winter** about a month ago at Barnes and Noble. i freaking love it and will definitely recommend it to anyone else
Got Captain Sonar a month ago. It's gotten a lot of plays since purchase. It's hard to play just one. So fun. 
We bought 4 Gods last week and we are enjoying it a lot! We always play the real time version and switch from game to game with open or hidden gods.
I actually just got mage knight a few days ago as an early Christmas present for myself. So far I'm loving it! I've only played the walkthrough intro scenario and I'm about one day into the solo conquest scenario. Definitely my heaviest game but I was watching lots of videos prior to purchase so it was easy enough to catch on once I got it. I've already added the Lost Legion expansion to my wish list. 
Last week we picked up a small stack at a flea market: **Fantastiqa** (rucksack edition), **Puerto Rico** and **Tichu**. We haven't got to play PR yet, and Tichu was kind of "meh." Fantastiqa was awful. Way too much setup for a dead simple game. Might be good for folks with kids (Tom Vasel seemed to like it), but for two adults who've played better deck builders it was a swing and a miss. Real shame, because the components were nice quality and it had a good sense of humor.

We like Race for the Galaxy and San Juan, so I'm hopeful Puerto Rico will fare better.
Picked up the **Arkham Horror LCG** on the rigorous decision tree of liking Arkham Horror and there's a cat on the back of the box. Haven't played it yet, but been reading through the rules and it seems pretty fun, prolly gonna try it this weekend.
**Fabled Fruit**: played 2 games so far and am very impressed, such a great game with a very simple ruleset. It's a really good time and lots of player interaction.
I recently bought **Lord of the Rings: The Card Game** core set for solo play, and I've been having a blast. It's the best solo game I've played (haven't played Mage Knight). That being said, this game is not good for my wallet, because of the desire to buy additional sets/adventure packs.
Most recent purchase was expansions for x-mas gifts, and before that is an online purchase that isn't here yet and I played a while back (*Mystery! Motive for Murder*, love the artwork and I like how it plays). 

The most recent new games played were **Bios Genesis** and **Pax Renaissance**, but I preorder ed that a while ago.

I'll be getting *Archipelago* with the solo expansion tomorrow, so that might get played tomorrow.

Prior to that was **Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu** which was okay.  Somewhere between *Forbidden Desert* and *Pandemic* in my opinion.

Overall, I'd say *Pax Renaissance* is one that I'd recommend those looking for a heavier game in a small box, and the one that interested me the most.   I really enjoy *Bios Genesis*, but that's a game I think has a much narrower appeal.
**Great Western Trail**: brilliant game.  Great mix of mechanics with quick, elegant play.  Lots of factors to weigh without being overwhelming.  Heavy, but approachable.  Currently sitting as my second 10 rated game on BGG.
**Among the Stars**

Have had a few solo playthroughs, holds up well. 
**Cry Havoc** - Really good "dudes on a map" game. We are playing it 3p mostly, always picking same faction. **Kemet** is getting worried in the shelf.
I picked up Grand Austria Hotel and Scythe from CSI, which got here early this week. Got my first play of GAH in, and I love it! It felt very much like a Feld, with trying to get enough small bonuses to avoid taking one of the five actions. Ended something like 183 - 179 - 110. I can see how the game would not be great with four, though. Next - Scythe!
**An Infamous Traffic**. I like it a lot so far
Oregon Trail was on sale so I grabbed it for $10 at Target. I also had to jump on the $16.xx for Sheriff of Nottingham.  Still have yet to play the first but I have played the other and I mainly bought it to expand my seven year old nephew's board game horizon. 
I bought **Mystic Vale**, **Codenames**, **Codenames Pictures**, **Karuba** and the **Bloody Inn** in a rush of blood to the head. Only played Karuba and the Bloody Inn so far, really liked both of them for completely different reasons. Oh, and I preordered **Blood Bowl** because I'm a sucker. 
Inis. It arrives saturday, so excited to play it. Before that it was Seafall which my group has been in love with. Can't wait to play it again.
After 3 years of debating I finally bought **Terra Mystica**. I tend to be terrible at Euro games. The first time I played Caverna I nearly had a meltdown from keeping track of everything, so I was so afraid TM was going to be too complicated for me. 

I bought it and played a 2-player practice game that same weekend with my friend who owns Caverna and ended up losing. But I was instantly hooked. I dreamed about what I was going to do next time I played that race. It's the only game I want to play lately. 

Surprisingly one of my most analysis-paralysis prone friends has opened up to the game well and enjoys it! Starting from his second game he started making some really bold choices that I'd never seen him do in other games, that we are affectionately dubbing "next-gen strats". 
I've bought a lot of games this month, but the only one I've gotten a chance to play is **Fury of Dracula**. Played one practice game with a friend, we enjoyed it a lot. We've played Letters from Whitechapel for comparison, and the one issue with that game is the detectives can start to get frustrated if they have a cold trail for a while. Fury at least gives them more options for finding Dracula.
Letters From White Chapel. It is so much fun and even more fun when you play the soundtrack from the Sherlock Holmes movies. 
Just got **Parade**. For a simple set of cards there is a lot going on. It is front heavy in that regard but after a few rounds it shows itself to be a light game with a depth of strategy. Plays differently at different player counts. Overall I would recommend it for the price, quality of components (everything was top of the line) and its gameplay. 
I picked up **Stockpile** about a couple of months ago. While it's only hit the table 5 or so times, that's more because of lack of gaming time than anything else.

The game is simple but engaging, and I can teach it in 5 minutes--which is a huge bonus in my group as we tend to have quite a few players who float in an out, so there is almost always someone new. We've played with both variants included in the box (Investor Cards and the 'B' side of the board), and while we loved the board, the investors probably won't get used much. They were solidly *ok*, but that's about it, and everyone who has played with them has kind of felt they weren't particularly well balanced, and didn't really add that much in terms of gameplay. To be fair though, it's really difficult to judge balance based on a few plays, so that judgement is based almost entirely on gut feeling. YMMV.

Overall, it's a solid auction/bluffing game. I can see it coming out quite often in the future, and I'm thinking of picking up the expansion at some point. 
**Keyflower**. It's just *so good*. 
**Googly Eyes** Honestly - pretty fun and goofy. Don't see the point of the board but those specs make it crazy hard!

Real games: **Arkham Horror: King in Yellow expansion** - crazY!!! Loved this expansion and made the game so fun. Blights are super difficult and the play in town totally messed up everyone.
My copy of **Conan** arrived a couple of days ago, does that count? I did technically purchase it two years ago.

It's stunning really, I could not be happier with the detail and sheer quantity of miniatures. I haven't played it yet of course but am really looking forward to it.

In terms of actual purchases, I finally got the **India** map for **Ticket to Ride**. I really really like it, the Mandala mechanic is great, it adds another option for the late game rather than just gambling with tickets. Not a huge fan of Switzerland though, I don't really like the tunnel mechanic sometimes requiring extra cards.
**crimson creek** - kickstarted game, i played a few rounds solo to get a feel for the rules and played a 2 player game recently.

Pro's - a very thematic game. Simpler game that the rulebook would suggest. Tension comes from the deduction of kleins attack and possible hidden traitor whos been possessed.

Con's - a few areas of the rules are easy to forget, you'll need to refer to rulebook in first plays. I'm already considering to make my own reference cards as reminders during play. 

There are better games but i really love the theme and immersion during play. Keeper for now
**Orleans : Trade and Intrigue** got this expansion for Orleans and played it 2p. The new beneficial deeds worked a lot better for a two player game. The delivery cards made the moving around on the map more fun and made a very viable strategy to focus on, even if the cards do add a considerable amount of randomness. The fun of chasing the deliveries totally outweighed the luck element (at least that's how I feel so far after one play) New event was a nice fresh thing that added even more new stuff. All in all a very good expansion I would say. 
My daughter bought me Hanabi for my birthday last weekend. We've played it about 8 times so far. It's really great. My kids are learning a lot about logic and deduction. Our best score so far is 21, our worst is 6 (and that game was my fault).
I bought the whole **Band of Brothers** trilogy, but still haven't had a chacne to try it out yet. Still trying to figure out all the rules/make time to play. :(
**Food Chain Magnate** and it's really really good. I only played two games with two players, where the one ahead bashes the one behind, but I can't wait to play it with more people.
Tiny Epic Western. It's... OK. I want to love it more than I do.

The theme is beautifully realised, it looks lovely on the table, there is great tension in pushing your luck. But 90% of the game comes down to the poker hands which tend to be a feast or famine. The player powers and building powers are underwhelming and unexciting and you can safely ignore them much of the time.
**Concordia** and **7 Wonders** - Both are excellent
I think that would be **Navegador** which has gotten a reprint recently.

I haven't played it yet, but the game looks really neat and interesting for a mid-complexity game like **Concordia** which is also from the same author. Can't wait to get it to the table.
**Escape from Colditz Anniversary Edition** I haven't had a chance to play it with my game group yet but the quality of components and packaging is amazing,  plus the addition if a history booklet that tells you about the original attempts is a really cool addition.  
I played this game when I was a kid and can't wait to see if it's as fun as I remember.  
**Forbidden Stars!**

Played a test game as 1v1 with myself to get to know rules better, and another 1v1 with my wife in preparation for Today's first actual game. Wife didn't like it, but she prefers other types of games. Had good expectations of the game, and so far I'm more than happy with what I've got. We'll see how it will go vs others (1v1 planned for tonight and a 4 player game tomorrow), but I have my hopes up.
**The Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction** just arrived in the post yesterday! I saw it on Dice Tower's Stocking Fillers 2016 video. I was going to get it for one of the people I game with regularly, but I figured we'd just play the games at my house anyway so I bought it for myself instead. Really enjoyed my first playthrough with SO, looking forward to trying it with 3p tonight!
I've not played the games from my most recent purchase, but the most recently purchased one that I played is ~~Master of Orion~~ and the game is very very good.
**Stronghold, 2nd edition**. Haven't played it yet but read the rules and super keen.
Evolution Climate - we have played the heck out of it and are happy we ordered it. The game can be friendly or cut throats and the trait cards provide enough variability that I expect we will play it on a regular basis. 
**Chinatown** 

We played one game and it was very nice. The end score was close and the trades were elaborate. It is a good game !
**Arkham Horror: The Card Game**: My son and I have played the game a few times and are really liking it. We've made it through the first 2 scenarios and will be attempting the third one tonight. I was worried about how the game would stand up to repeated plays but I find that there is enough variability in the game through difficulty, randomness and character selection to warrant many repeated plays. 
Got **Bruges** and **Tuscany Essential Edition** last week. So far I've only played **Bruges** but it's quickly becoming one of my top games.
I purchased Pixel Tactics 2 and have loved it a lot with my partner. We've played almost every leader, and some multiple time each (I can't win against ilandrayamorella or whatever) we're very much looking forward to getting the next sets and building decks with them.
About Month ago I bought forbidden stars, in order to sell it, primarly. but I played it while ago and it was an excellent game I really wanted in my collection.

It sits in the corner, tempting me. But I do enjoy such fight over my character. so, for now I'm leaving it in shrink.

also a bunch of expansions for Theseus the dark orbit (to be played), Neuroshima hex (played, I'm loving it. It reminded me that Hex isn't dead), chaos in the old word (to be played). Next week I'll get Blood Rage:  mysics in my hands. and I'm planning on printing a few fan armies fomr neuroshima hex.
7 Wonders Duel. 

I am in LOVE with it. One of the neatest blends of mechanics I've seen in a while, and a great balance of depth and brevity. 
Just got **Coup: Reformation** and **Spyfall**. Haven't played them yet but it'll be sorted out soon
Feast for Odin. Only played it once but I loved it.
I scooped up a beautiful big box of **INIS** earlier this week and got to play an introductory few rounds, though not a full game. In short, I can't friggin wait to play again! The card drafting provides a really difficult method to put together a plan, especially when you just want those sweet, sweet yellow cards every round. 

Every little bit of progress you make on the board feels like a monumental achievement, and the aspect of (albeit simplified) negotiation really works nicely when all parties are guaranteed to lose something during the clash.

All in all, I have no buyer's remorse over this one whatsoever and it already has a nice big spot on the shelf to show off all of it's amazing artwork!
I can't get enough of **Arctic Scavengers** since I picked it up last week. Dominion was dry for me, but I like the concept of a deck builder, your own little army/stack of cards that your constantly improving and weeding out the bad cards. Arctic Scavengers hits its theme perfectly, I love the skirmishes for contested resources, the randomness of searching through the junk pile, and the cards in the bank are fair and balanced. I also picked up **Friday** a few weeks ago, so I've been in deck builder heaven for a little while.
Haven't watched the video. Played this three times at BGGcon and immediately preordered it through Miniature Market. This is Low Player Count approved. :)
This is so much on my to-buy-asap list along with Fabled Fruit!
He says it killed Ora et Labora for him. I just ordered OeL a couple days ago. I don't regret it though. Colonists does look interesting but I'm not sure my group will play a game of this length. 
This is a game I want.. but the game length scares me..
I NEED to get this game to the table!
Pity it's unavailable right now.
I've had this preordered for a while and it's been on my watchlist since it was announced. While I trust Lookout and the theme sounded interesting- it was hard to tell what it might be, since this is designer Tim Puls' first endeavour. I'm super happy to hear that people are liking it (from plays of the advanced Essen copies). I love the idea of saving a game and continuing later. This caters to my life as a gamer dad. 


I'll have to check this one out!
Shame Rahdo won't be doing a video for Feudum.
I got to play this at BGG.CON and I'd say Rahdo's time estimates are a little hyperbolic. I played a four player, two age game where all four of us had never played before and it took under two hours. The next day I played a full four age, four player game with two new players and it took just barely over four hours, I think saving and continuing after each age might add a good amount of time to the game as the players will have to reacquaint themselves with the board state and their strategy each time but even then, seven hours seems like a stretch.

Looks like a great weekend!

To assuage your concerns a bit with Twilight Imperium; the game really comes to life (in my personal experiences) with experienced players and aggressive/ interactive public goals. I think it simply has too high a mental load to allow new players to get totally stuck in to the *real* game of planning, manoeuvring, negotiation, politicking and backstabbing. It's a shame that gets lost in the first play with simply trying to keep (some of) the following in your head at any time: resource costs, what each ship type actually is/ looks like, what the next tech tree purchase could be, how many spaces each ship can move, what the strategy cards actually do, how the transfer action works, etc. It's just too much to keep all that and functionally make plans that can be fluid, functional and highly reactive/ engaging with other players!

However, once people have got that stuff memorised effectively, it genuinely does transform into this epic, grand game where the focus is on outplaying your friends, rather than managing a sprawling spreadsheet.

That said, manoeuvring around the board is incredibly slow and combat is so costly that it does encourage players to bunch up their units and keep them largely stationary. What we've found that really encourages smaller, more active forces is a selection of the objective cards that force engagement (e.g. successfully win a ground engagement, kill a single enemy ship), combined with interesting wormhole placement and artifacts. Artifact planets especially go a long way to alleviate the problems of force buildup in purely homesystems/ around Mecatol Rex. If you (likely) found that people kept to their "pie-slices" and didn't interact with others on the opposite side of the table, then the [Shattered Ascension Maps](http://www.astralvault.net/games/SA/maps.html) may be **exactly** what you're looking for. They're radical re-designs that put players into completely different locations than arranged neatly around the edge of the table, and they *really* encourage interesting fleet movement and constant diplomacy. A caveat: the setups aren't equal and involve bidding for placement, so require players who can estimate the value of the locations.

That's a lot more than I meant to write! Looks like a great time :)
Hey, man. I was just wondering about those green boards/mats you used in some of your photos. What material is it, and where can I get something similar? I've given up on owning an actual gaming table and this seems like the next best thing. Thanks.
This sounds like an enviable weekend! Thank you so much for the report.
You say "cracked" a lot.
Wow really looks like an amazing weekend!
Wish a had group of friends to play games with regularly.
Looks amazing!

I have that same duvet set lol
Meh.... I wish i had more friends :(
Your opinion of scythe, please, before I finally go and buy it.
Sounds like an amazing time! Thanks for the write up (I may steal your twilight imperium intro for when I eventually get the game.) You've actually inspired me to do something similar with my friends!
In all of these amazing pictures, I keyed on one stupid thing: I noticed that the blue player in your **Scythe** game has both a Monument and a Mill built on the same territory... which is illegal (only 1 structure per territory).

Not sure if you knew that or not. Or... was there a card play that allowed you to do that? I'm not familiar with an action or a card that lets you break that rule, but I might be wrong. 

Anyway. Sorry for being pedantic. Your gaming weekend looks flippin' *awesome*, and now I'm inspired to do something similar. Thanks for sharing! :)
Very cool! Glad you liked **Scythe**. I love it too. Feel free to ask any rules questions!
I'd suggests **Legends of Andor** because it takes the trope of "heroes bashing all the monsters to win" and tosses it out the window.   Yes, you can do that - but in this game every defeated monster advances the story counter up the track.  Go on a slaughterfest and the game races to the end and you lose.  Instead you have to strategically pick and choose your battles and what to defeat.
Really depends on what you're interested in.

Enjoy the Alien or Predator movies? Try one of the Legendary Encounters games.

Starship Troopers? Try XenoShyft.

Wanna plot to assassinate Hitler? Look at the new release, Black Orchestra.

Enjoy Lovecraft a lot and want more? Elder Sign is here for your dice-rolling needs.

Are you a fan of the Attack on Titan anime or manga? Check out the Deck-Building Game from Cryptozoic.

Want to play a dungeon crawler as a rodent? Mice & Mystics might be your jam.

Interested in Christianity? Maybe Commissioned is up your alley.

Want to free the slaves? Freedom: The Underground Railroad.

Fancy a good mystery to solve? Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective is there for you.

I have not played a few of these, I'm just offering suggestions.
Mechs vs Minions is an awesome co-op game. It is on the more expensive side but it is such a beautiful and well put together game that it is worth it.

It plays 2-4 and with 10 custom missions that have infinite replay value, the game feels like it won't stop giving. Ive personally burned through the tutorial countless times to introduce new players to the game and have yet to tire of it. 

Gameplay / mechanic wise it is a drafting computing game that you need to complete various objectives to complete the missions.

Good luck!
Flashpoint: Fire Rescue
Theme comes through really well. 
**Burgle Bros** is a fantastic heist themed game. It also happens to be one of the best Co op games that I have played. 


Think of it as Forbidden Office Complex.
I would suggest **Robinson Crusoe**. A lot of replayability and overall very fun and just got a new release. I'm not a super Pandemic fan, but the "In the lab" expansion is by far the most fun setup I've played pandemic in. Might but fun to take a look at.
Just to add a few different ones, I just picked up Hanabi and Samurai Spirit.
**Betrayal At House On The Hill** is an interesting coop game where one person turns evil.  
[Castle Panic is great for what you want. ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IUFSPM/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_WFLnybAYTZ5V7)
**...and then we held hands** is my fiance and I's favorite co-op game with the right theme for couples to boot.
If you want to continue the Lovecraft theme, [Arkham Horror Card Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205637/arkham-horror-card-game) is fabulous.

A fun co-op game is [Flash Point: Fire Rescue](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100901/flash-point-fire-rescue)
I started with **Pandemic** when I started dating my girlfriend years back. And now we have a pretty good collection of Coop games. This is the list without any priority:

- **Zombicide** any of them would do, either start with season 1 and go slowly into season 3 and expensions or start with **Zombicide: Black Plague** as it has better rules as they have been reviewed many times

- **Burgle Bros** This one was a big surprise and very fun to play. Challenging as well.

- **Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King** this is game is basically the videogame Gaunlet but in a boardgame, pretty fun to play either one against the team or just against the game.

- **Forbiddent Desert** this one is a different take on the Forbidden Island, so, this one shouldn't be priority.

- **Flashpoint** I've heard wonders about this one, as it is basically Pandemic but with Firefighters. (I do not own this one, so I cannot tell you much more.]

This are the ones I can come up on the top of my head, my collection is quite varied.
I suggest Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, kind of like TIME Stories but with 10 cases in the box. My group loved it.
- **Robinson Crusoe** is quite a fun euro'esque Co-Op game. Just prepare to starve to death a lot since it's quite a difficult game.
- And if you two are ready for something quite a bit more heavier and strategy intensive there's always **Mage Knight**. Though it may be too heavy for you two as games can last upwards of 4-5 hours, and there's a lot of thinking involved.
- Descent 2. ed with the App can now be played Co-Op if you're in the mood for some dungeon crawling. 
- And then there's always the infamous **Pandemic:Legacy** which you probably know of and is beloved by all of Reddit it seems, though I personaly haven't played it. 
Surprised no one has mentioned Pandemic Legacy yet. THE top ranked game on boardgamegeek.com and so addictive - my wife and I played it through in two weekends (total playing time was probably about 16 hours or so). The only downside for you might be that vanilla pandemic will never feel the same again ;)

Oh and in case you're wondering whether it's even worth playing if you've played Pandemic a bunch: it totally is. The legacy component adds so many different nuances that very quickly you forget how simple the base game was.

Also - my wife and I were facing a similar decision recently and ended up buying Star Trek: Frontiers, which is a somewhat modified (slightly simplified) version of Mage Knight with a scenario we liked better. Have only played it a couple of times so far - definitely has way higher complexity than any of our previous co-op games, we missed a bunch of rules in both games, but it does show a lot of potential.
My partner and i tend to enjoy lighter games, so I'd recommend Onirim and And Then We Held Hands. Try Beyond Baker Street too!

This isn't a cooperative game, but recently we have been loving Hive. And if you don't mind some laugh-out-loud mind games, 13 Days is a very thematic game. A deck building favourite for us two is Dale of Merchants.
My wife and I..
We have many "collectors" in the groups I play in.  My modest collection of 140+ games is far from the largest.  So, there are always, ALWAYS new games to play.  We still somehow manage to get some repeat plays in.  But, I'd say almost every session involves at least one new game hitting the table.
I will always learn a new game if possible. I'd never go back if it meant I would always have something new to play.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, would gladly play one game 200 times and master it. Which I think is the most boring thing I've ever heard.
What's a game group, precious?

Honestly, I prefer old classics. My group prefers learning new games (to an extent). Good news is there are plenty of old games I can bring in and masquerade as new ones. 
I love replaying as do most in my main group but I also play with the kind of people who go to Essen every year and crowdfund. 
There are always new games to try and my group generally is excited to learn them. But we so also always go back to stuff we've played before since a few people tend to prefer playing what they are comfortable with and can sometimes be resistant to trying new things. 

Me, I can generally play a brand new games a few times and then I'll be good on playing it for months. From there on out, I tend to be content if I only played any given game at least once in a year. 
The dynamic in my group is much the same.  For a long time I was always introducing new games and people have always been complaining that they never get to play the same game twice.  So finally I've been just re-playing games for the last 3 months or so, barely playing any new games with them.

There is one person in the group who is particularly stubborn about only playing the same 3 games that that person knows.

For a while my group was big enough to split into two, so I could teach some people a new game while the other people played a familiar game.  Unfortunately numbers have fallen in the last few months.
[The Cosmodex: An Encyclopedia For Cosmic Encounter](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/536444/cosmodex-20-encyclopedia-cosmic-encounter) 

Try that, I've found it pretty useful. 

During actual games though we usually won't bother looking things up. Just go with whatever seems the most reasonable and then I'll check it after. 
Generally 90% of the time if you go back and walk through which phase things occur in you can figure out what happens first.
Most things can be worked out by a couple of rules of thumb. Phases first, obviously. Planning aliens before the reveal, etc.

Then, as with choosing alliances; offense, defense, clockwise from offense.

So if two aliens are modifying the score in the reveal, offense's modifier happens first.
If you have some trouble coming to a decision then I suggest you decide with your group beforehand on how conflicts will be handled. Such as a coin toss, rock paper scissors, or a group vote. This should only be used if everyone can't reach consensus.

Also if it's a timing conflict it's resolved in the order of offense, defense, allies blah blah
I own the retail box of the first core game, Beyond the Grave, and a small handful of extra heroes. I find that it's more than enough game. I understand your hesitation. You look back at the Kickstarter and feel like you're "missing" stuff. Having 40 heroes to choose from is nice I suppose, and some people really pump up the "variety" that all those extras offer. But truly you're not "missing" out on anything really. Don't let that completionist bug bite ya. There are definitely some get-it-or-forget-it style Kickstarter games out there, but I find that as more time goes on AQ is one that stands fine on it's retail legs. I went all in on Black Plague thinking "ha, I'll get in on it this time." I basically have 40 dudes with swords that give my group sensory overload when trying to pick survivors. Just my 2 cents.
I actually bought **Arcadia Quest** a couple of months ago from Amazon. 

The retail version comes with twelve heroes and one campaign in the box. There's more than enough here to warrant purchasing. The heroes in the box are varied and all play differently. No two missions or campaigns ever unfold exactly the same. 

If you're at all interested, go ahead and buy it. There are plenty of goodies in the box without the KS stuff. There's also expansions and heroes for purchase as well. I haven't regretted my purchase at all. 

I own the base and beyond the grave (no Kickstarter) and it's a smash hit with a few friends.  I've late pledged inferno but I don't feel at all that I'm missing anything by not having the previous Kickstarter exclusives.  One of my favourite games for sure
You can go to their website and print the cards for the KS exclusive heroes 
Iirc, that stuff is mainly ks exclusive heroes with very little effect on gameplay. It's reportedly a good game even if you buy at retail 
I'm playing right now with my son (holiday time of is great for campaign board games). This is our third time through the campaign. We have just the retail base game and it's fantastic. We've also ordered Inferno, but if the Arcadia Quest base game was all we had it would still be tons of fun. 
Arcadia Quest is my favorite game and that was before I got the kickstarter stuff. Honestly, I haven't really even been able to move beyond the core set to try out the Nameless or Beyond the Grave campaigns.

By the way, the Nameless Campaign is not a new campaign. It's pretty much the same campaign but you switch out some monsters and bosses with Voldemort/Death Eater type enemies. Beyond the Grave is a whole new campaign with new quests, items, and monsters/Bosses.
I have the base game. I pledged for the last Kickstarter but was too late for the first.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't drooling over the exclusives. But really, there's nothing substantial missing. It's a very correct them all Pokémon feel. But you still get 100% of an amazing game without them.

The exclusives are about 80% heroes, 20% enemies, this just offer greater variety, but not in very important ways. 

I really like Arcadia Quest. A LOT. And I feel for you. I feel the same way about the first. But still get it. If you want the variety of abilities for the hero's you play with. Print the exclusives!

Look what I did just this last week: [Guildmaster heros](http://i.imgur.com/KdzQg6y.jpg)
And this imgur album: http://imgur.com/a/z2L6s

I know the standees are not the same as having the actual miniatures, but better that than nothing or paying hundreds for plastic.

And if you print the hero cards and get expansions for more monsters, 5 monsters in the base game can be used as heros.

Arcadia Quest is one of my favorite games. And they will release another Kickstarter within 2 years and you'll get a ton of extra heros there.

It's important to remember, if the heros in the campaigns weren't exclusive, they might not have gotten that many made. Being exclusive gives a large incentive to back the campaign, leading to much larger final funding amounts, and thus the ability to provide lots of extra figures.

Basically, the exclusives vs non exclusives are a very small difference in actual gameplay. Unless you really want to collect every figure, which at this point is very costly, there's no reason to not just print the rules for the exclusives and substitute with standees or other figures.

Kind of like Pokémon Black being available normally, but Pokémon White being "special" and exclusive. When the difference is mainly in our heads.

I also have Blood Rage retail. I REALLY want the Kickstarter monsters. But I fucking LOVE the base game. Played over 20 times. Doesn't matter. It's all just incentives to help fund the game. But there are over 50 retail available heroes now. (Or will be once Inferno and Mazmorra and expansions become available.)

Would you buy the 50+ exclusives if they didn't make them exclusive and they were available retail? That would be over $500! Suddenly you wouldn't really care about most of them. See my point? It's all perspective.
You can probably get the base game for less than this in the right sale, or secondhand, if it's not worth quite so much to you.
I started with only the core set, and it is currently my favorite game...
There's so much content now at retail, you're really not missing out.  There are something like 50-60 playable characters you can get at retail amongst all of the boxes, so there's another 40-50 that are exclusive, you really don't need that many...
I would wait for the **Arcadia Quest: Inferno** to be released, and get that.
I don't think it's too late at all. The base content is a lot. The KS stuff is mostly just for extra variety (more hero choice, etc., but then you can buy lots of extra heroes too).
I don't know if the Inferno late pledge was more than $100 but for the sake of this let's say it was at least $100 and $15 to ship. I got AQ base for about $50 on amazon warehouse. BtG is normally $40ish. Assuming Inferno will eventually reach the same range as the AQ base box, I'll end up playing $150 or so with "free" (prime) shipping. So it will cost me a whole $35 more (if that) for far, far more tile sets and campaign content and still have more than enough characters without the stretchgoals.

I just don't see the campaign as worth it if you don't already have AQ. Start with the base and if you play enough get BtG. You will have more game ready to play sooner than the Inferno set will come in to any backers.

Its definitely a pretty good game, even without the extra options. I kickstarted them and have the extras, but it leads to alot of extra set up time in a game where the set up time is already my biggest problem. The extra time when it comes to deal out all the character cards, and then dig through extra characters for the ones people pick (in addition to some of level of balance of the bonus characters being off IMO) and you wont be hurting for variety with the characters in the base box.
I have played the base game with some friends back in Spain and it was pretty fun. I do know about the kickstarter exclusives, as I have backed some of their projects before. But even the base game is good enough to not miss any of the extra stuff until you play it enough so you feel the need to expand the game.
You get plenty of game in the retail box.
Panamax with 4 players is three times better than with 3 players which is ten times better than with 2 players. It really wants 4 players to be at its best. 


**Chicago Express** is quite quick, like well under 90 minutes. ~~, otherwise if you're courageous enough for something really challenging (and much longer) get a copy of *GMT*'s **1846**.~~

Or, something much easier to learn than **Brass** but just as challenging (and long) to play well against competent opponents: **Age of Steam**. Rules are very simple but the interaction and competition are so fun that some game designers still find it amusing to create new maps (there are well over 100 expansion maps).
The following are all villain and ally packs of Wave 1 (core set):

General Weiss (there is already an AT-ST in the core set so getting Weiss is really a luxury if you don't care about the command cards).

Royal Guard Champion

IG-88

Han Solo

Chewbacca

Rebel Troopers

Rebel Saboteurs

Taken a look at [Patchistory](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144041/patchistory)? 
It's really just "themed" - a veneer of it: **Peloponnes** which takes about an hour, maybe 75 minutes with some expansions thrown in. It's a ancient civ-theme but mostly it's a tough auction game - medium weight - and plays 2-5.

If your friends like it, I'd suggest buying **Peloponnes Box** which includes all the expansions (7 total) and allows you to play up to 8-player. (This pack does not include the base game so you're okay to try out the base game first.)
I just looked at a few online and I ended up coming across **Nations**.  Any opinions on that one?
Pax porfiriana/pamir? 
 * **Kemet** (2 hrs, 2-5 players) is a neat area control game that also looks amazing.  Miniatures, Egypt-themed, mythology creatures.
 * **Spheres of Influence: Struggle for Global Supremacy** (2 hrs w normal player counts, 2-8 players) is kind of like Risk 2.0.  It doesn't use dice, the combat is a lot more interesting, it has a three-faceted economy (some territories have more production, some have oil, some have points of interest)...overall just a much better game than Risk.  Also, it can actually play up to 8 players technically, although I haven't played it with more than 4 and I know most games that scale that high tend to bog down with higher player counts...who wants to wait forever for your turn to come around?
 * **Raiders of the North Sea** (1.5 hrs, 2-4 players) is my favorite worker placement game.  Vikings theme, raiding and pillaging, neat twist on worker placement where you place a worker and then pick up a worker.  And the most beautiful game board I have ever seen, period.  Also, there's an expansion in the works.

Edit: added gameplay lengths and player counts.

Edit 2: all of these games are free-for all.  Spheres of Influence probably lends itself the most to making alliances.
Jamie has just nailed the production of these videos. Really hit the ground running. 
[deleted]
I am definitely liking these reviews with Jamie. Also it's a refreshing change of pace to not be delivering the review in front of the standard wall of games backdrop.
Cool to see this game getting coverage. It's pretty unique. Component quality is a little low and the standees are kinda stupidly designed with the names on the bottom and vicious feet. But the story it tells is quite cool.
Happy to see this game getting a good review. Love playing it. Maybe i will win someday.
As with any heavier game, read the rule book fully and before you teach it to others, do yourself a favour and set up the game and just try a few turns playing a few different players to see how each of the actions work. 

The rule book for TM is pretty clear and there are only a few tricky rules (how gaining power works, managing your power, special powers, etc).

There are a few video on YouTube (search "Terra Mystica how to play") that might give you a good overview before reading the rules. 

When teaching Terra Mystica I do it like so: 

1. explain the player board and how it works, how you uncover new income when you build different buildings and the way the upgrading works.
2. explain the map and how you can only build on your terrain type
3. explain the terraforming wheel (cost) on your player board
4. explain shipping and how it relates to the map
5. using the player aid as reference now explain the different actions you can do on your turn (I start from the top and explain each separate action in detail).
6. explain end game scoring of the map and temple tracks

there are some teaching scripts on BGG that are much more detailed, but I follow that general structure whenever I teach it.
Reading the rules. It's really not that bad. 
Aaaaabi explained the proces well. 
One other important thing is to stick to the races that are suggested for the first games, as other might get confusing for a first time players.
Play the solitaire version.  Use the exact same rules as the main game for two players, EXCEPT with this variation:

-  After you pass, place one dwelling of another color on any tile adjacent to one of yours.  Then you may choose to collect power as in the rules for placing stuff.

-  See if you can get at least 80 points with every faction.

Common rules mistakes I see newbies make in Terra Mystica:

-  You take a special action tile at the start of the game.  

-  The placement for what it takes to make a town, and the largest town for bonus points have different requirements.  If you need a reminder, think of bridges with towns, and sailboats for bonus points (not really, but sort of).

-  There are many ways to make analogies about collecting power for adjacency.  find one that works best for you and/or your group.  I'm sure users here have hilarious ways of remembering them properly :)
Time to go broke. *Gently strokes wallet* You've been a good friend. But sometimes, sacrifices need to be made.
Those chose Black Friday as the day of the relaunch? Isn't that a little strange?
Estimated ship date: December 2020 lol
Hmm, if they have any new expansions or other interesting content in the Kickstarter, I will be backing it for those.
Do we have any idea what this might cost? 
If I had the money I would. Sadly not an option for me.
+
Shhh.... Keep it quiet so it's easier to get the deals ;)
Do you know what time does it start ?
I already own the game but if it is for a lower price than their retail I will probably buy a second copy. My rule book is falling apart, I want more armor sets, I want more than 3 of some gear cards and I want to replace a few cards that has some scratches from before I sleeved them. But I hope and expect that there will be more than just the base game.
I'm thinking of throwing money at a core set, but not sure if I can justify the price or not. 

We play a lot of P&P RPGS already so not sure if KDM would offer much more for the cash. 

Game does look great though & is probably fantastic for groups that don't have anyone willing or able to DM. 
Hold on, can you send a link or can you direct me to the proper channel to check this out?
Twin Shadows adds its own campaign, which is shorter than the core campaign. It could be argued, that it is a better campaign to start with, because of the shortness, and that's what we did, but you would be fine playing the core campaign if money is an issue.
Each expansion is either a full Campaign (Return to Hoth) or a Mini Campaign (Bespin Gambit, Twin Shadows).

The mini campaigns are shorter and your characters start at a higher level. They are good fun. The full campaigns (core game and Hoth), you start at level 1 and are considerably longer. You can use most side missions from any expansion with any campaign. There are rules for this in rulebook for the expansion you are playing and it will tell you what side missions can be used. If I remember correctly each side mission has a timing statistic? Basically you find out what ones you can use and build a side mission deck for the campaign.

Bespin Gambit adds Cloud City tiles and missions. Lando is in it as well as a new Imperial deck and 2 Rebel Heroes.

Twin Shadows adds Tatooine stuff, Bobba Fett, a new Imperial Deck and 2 Rebel Heroes.

Hoth adds 2 Imperial Decks, 3 Rebel Heroes and hoth themed minis and tiles.

Each expansion also adds a bunch of stuff for the skirmish game mode.

I'm also looking at Vast for a very long time. I'll get it probably as soon as it comes out. Also Clank! looks pretty good, with deckbuilding involved.
Maybe **Arcadia Quest**?
It is kind of PVP and PVE at the same time. Maybe something you can check.
**Tomb**. Maybe? I'm not too familiar with the games you listed and I never see it mentioned here, so I'm not really sure about its reception.
It is not fantasy but the new Walking Dead All Out War game is competitive with groups of survivors trying to scavenge while manipulating neutral zombies into the other teams. Great fun.
Every day unless I'm unable (road trip, illness, etc).

You always make time for the things you love.

Tonight was Runebound; my 9 year old won.  Battle Tome + Heroic Blade = win.
not nearly enough! Guess with friends getting married and life gets busier, hard to organize, but I try once a week and a meatier game!
Every day. Housewifery has perks.
You guys are all quite lucky! I manage to host one game day 50% of the  weekends. Then during the week I succeed in convincing the wife to play after the kid is asleep about 1-2 times a week on average, short games. I think in my best week I get 1/5th played than the people in the rest of the comments :(
I host 2-3 game nights each week and I try to get games in on the other days as well lol
I could copy/paste what I just typed but all those asterisks would need to be redone: https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5eldep/the_new_year_is_quickly_approaching_what_games/dadi59h/ 

But those are just my nickels... [Here are my plays by month,](https://boardgamegeek.com/plays/bymonth/user/Jesse%20Custer/subtype/boardgame/start/2016-01-01) which work out to 315 so far - getting close to an average of a game a day. :)

Typically, I host a game night a week, go to another on Friday night, and also participate in an afternoon event on Sunday.
It varies, roughly 10 times a month, I guess? Some games get played every few months, other at least once each month.

I do live with family, though. My parents taught us to play since my brother and I were young, so the only difference now is we get to play things beyond traditional card games.
Man...  you guys make me feel like I don't play nearly enough.  Twice a month.  My group meets biweekly.  Maybe I need a second group
At least once a week. I meet a group at my FLGS and we play for about 4-6 hours. There is another group that meets once a month or so for longer sessions, at least 8 hours. I play at home and with a nearby friend sporadically, but I feel I get my money's worth from my games and it hasn't driven me into crippling debt so it's not hurting anything. Most pressing concern right now is space, honestly.

Edit: since a lot of people have been adding their plays, I will add that I have 441 plays for this year and have played 116 different games.
I'm close to 70 games & expansions now.  Last few months I've been limited to once a week when I'm lucky due to life.  That's clearing up now, so I'm hoping to start a consistent schedule of 2-3 times a week.  
As much as I can. I have in the neighborhood of 150 games, not counting expansions or my 4-year-old's games.

I try to go regularly to my FLGS's weekly game night, and I always bring 2-4 games with me (they don't always get played, depends on what everyone else wants to play).

I usually get to play at least one game with my wife (sometimes 3-4) in a week.

Once in a while, whenever schedules align, we have my regular group (me, wife, sister, bro's girlfriend) together playing whatever (currently The Marcy Case and Pandemic Legacy, usually with other games before/after). This sometimes happens once a week, but sometimes they're a month apart.

I will often play my son's games with him, whenever he asks, as long as I'm not feeling particularly lazy. Usually this is Outfoxed!, My First Carcassonne, Magic Labyrinth, Enchanted Tower, The Little Firefighters, or Click Clack Lumberjack. Usually once a week, sometimes more.

On top of that, I like playing solo games, and usually play by myself between 1 and 4 times per week (depends on my mood and game choices).

So, I guess a lot... But I'd game every night if I could.
I usually game 4-7 days a week. If I wanted, I could play games every night each week. To be fair, all my friends in my current city are from board gaming and I'm an extrovert so going out and playing games helps my mental health 
Not often as I realised that the one grouo I played with had a pretty consistent "play our games not yours" unspoken rule.
Every Weekend and one day in the week (usually Thursday). Often even more times in the week when I play with my SO.
This year I have logged 144 plays in BGG, but I know there's some things I haven't logged.

I play once a week for sure, on a Tuesday night. In addition I have one Saturday a month that's an all day game day. I then occasionally manage to get in another game night somewhere during the week.

I would say I play games enough. But the thing is I seldom get to play games I own. The host of the Tuesday night session generally selects a game from his collection for everyone to play. If we get to 7+ people, we'll generally split into two groups, and then I might get something I own to the table, with the caveat that everyone else is trying to do the same. The full day Saturday games are also everyone bringing their own games to play, which means I may get 1, 2 or 3 games played that day, depending on everyone's mood, whether I want to teach or not and if everyone wants to play a longer game (90 mins+) or not.
Whenever my board gaming friend and I are available to hang out, which varies. I spent two nights at his house, and we played board games for a collective 7-10 hours. I usually play board games an average of 1.5 times a week.
At least one game a day, generally. I have a gaming boyfriend.

As for >2p, that's usually once a week, at Labyrinth Games' Thursday meetup.
Lately, maybe twice a month or so. At my peak, like three times a week. I miss those days.
About once a week on every Saturday night. We'll take some time off during the holidays though and be back in full swing in 2017.
Spoilers, here's the list:

1. King of Tokyo
2. Pandante
3. Snatch-It
4. Click! Clack! Lumberjack!
5. Qwirkle
6. Incan Gold / Diamante
7. Once Upon A Time
8. Survive: Escape from Atlantis!
9. Timeline: British History
10. Blokus
11. Hive
12. Ghost Blitz
13. Happy Salmon
14. Taboo
15. Chairs
16. Elk Fest
17. Funemployed
18. Word On The Street
19. The Resistance
20. Carcassonne
I'm surprised how good this list is! It covers many of the bases for different kinds of players - lots of family friendly stuff and The Resistance, Carcassonne, Timeline and Survive will all make good Christmas evening games.
I stayed away from this game for awhile since my wife doesn't like direct confrontation. Ended up receiving it in the GenCon math trade this year, slightly skeptical, but every time we've played it everyone has had an absolute blast. My typically reserved sister in law went full chaos mode after someone destroyed one of her full boats and ate everyone aboard, it was awesome.
Love this game!  First picked it up back in 1982 on a camping trip with my Mom.  Lots of nostalgia for me.  Every one I've ever introduced it to has liked/loved it. 
I received this in the boardgames gift exchange this year :D. I love how the island disappears and the board gets busy with sea monsters. It's a fun theme.
Like many others I think it's a good gateway game for introducing people to the hobby. That being said I've grown pretty tired of it. I've seen what this game has to offer and besides all the randomness and take-that there's not really much to it. I still recommend it to people and wouldn't refuse to play it if people insists.
OK. This is on my list of shame (thankfully the list isn't too long)... I've had this one for about a year but haven't had a chance to break it out yet. 

Hopefully this post will prod me to do so soon!
Great game. Great gateway. But be aware - it's very cutthroat (or should be played as such). 

This game is frequently touted as a good game for families/kids - but I would only play it with kids that were 'mature' gamers - most kids wouldn't be able to handle all the vindictive play. 
I love this game. I never play to win though, only to cause untold amounts of havoc. The first time I played it with friends, they were like, we can trust him on the boat. I laughed so hard as I steered that boat straight into a sea serpent. 

I picked up the expansions, but I feel like they just complicate a streamlined and well -paced game. 
My goto 5-player game.  Tons of laughs and entertainment every time it hits the table!  Turns are short and everyone stays engaged!  The game also ends in around an hour and does not overstay its welcome.
They named this game wrong. The real name is Fuck You. 
This is a very fun game that for some reason doesn't make it to the table as much as it should. I believe the reason for that is it is very cutthroat and some people don't do well with those types of games. But for people that love that do, it is one of the best.

Also, I got lucky and found 3 copies of this in thrift stores in 6 months all 30 miles apart from each other when I lived in Utah. I haven't found another one since in the over 10 years that I lived there.
I love this game.  This is my go to game for getting my younger nieces and nephews into gaming.  

Last time we played, one of my nieces kept driving her boat in a circle in the middle of the ocean.  One of my nephews sent a sea monster over to sink her ship.  It was quite fun.
Make sure to get the giant squids and extra players expansions for sure!!!


We love this game. My wife is always so 'non confrontational' when she plays that she makes everyone else feel bad about killing her survivors. So instead of being the only ass who goes after her, I just started making sure i had one of my survivors in all of her boats!

It's as everyone else said, a great gateway game.
Love it so much. Gets a *lot* of play. Have all 3 mini expansions, but imo the only must-have is 5-6 player. A) because I regularly have 5-6 and B) Orange!
Played it as a kid.  So looked forward to the rare nights my parents would play it with me.  I bought it a few years ago and, sadly, have only put it on the table three times.  But it has been with three groups and each group loved it.  Such a good game!
Picked this up at a thrift store for a few euros. The components alone seem worth it. Cheers for this. 
Love the game, except for the whole 'some people are worth more than others' concept.
Loved it and picked up the expansions. Love the clock of tile removal. And yes very cutthroat!
All the expansions are "must buy", in my opinion. Great gateway game, tons of people I know have gone out and bought it after playing it.
Always a delight to play! Love it!!
This is a stage coincidence. I just bought this from a charity shop in the UK for 1 pound 50. Different cover though. It is a 1986 version, and looking on ebay, worth a bit of cash. After reading comments, might have to give it a game before selling!
Extremely fun game to play with kids. My 7 year old and 5 year old love the theme, and they're prone to giving their people elaborate backstories and "narrating" the game. They don't play particularly strategically but they definitely understand some of the latent sadism!
Probably one of my most played games, always fun for casual people and goes along with drinking quite well. Havent run into anyone who didnt have fun playing this, even as cut throat as it gets.
This is known as "Feed Daddy's Meeples to The Sharks" game at my home... it's definitely fun, but there's definitely some "take that!" Involved in this one...
I love this game.  I loved it as a kid and I still love it, which is a rarity.
I really like this game a lot but I miss the original version with its smaller pieces. Still recommended! Its very pleasing to eat a full boat of opponents...
I have the harbor expansion for the regular game, but I figure the card is the same. The City Hall card is a free landmark for each player at the start of the game. That is why it has the yellow start back and not an unbuilt landmark back. 
This may or may not be helpful, especially considering you're aiming to have a physical board on which to play.

Have you heard of [Habitica](www.habitica.com)? It's an online "rpg" where you can set goals, habits and daily tasks that you can tick off to get "rewards" such as gold and items. You train your character by completing tasks and levelling up. Fairly standard, but unfortunately non-physical rewards don't really give much incentive to keep on going.

However, what you can do is add your own rewards to purchase with the coins you get from completing tasks. You could add "Add €1 to board games budget" as a reward which you can buy (over and over) when you've saved enough from your habits, tasks and completed goals.

You won't have a physical board but you will have the physical feedback and being able to access it through any browser will mean you can still keep track, even if you're away from home.
Read it. Stopped. Texted gf. Doing the same thing. Thanks
Have you heard of [SuperBetter](https://www.superbetter.com/)? I recently rented the book from the library and it gives you different ways to overcome anxiety, reinforce your social network, become more efficient, etc. by "living gamefully." 

If you need an excuse to play games like Tetris, Bejeweled, and Patchwork, tell the person that you're overcoming something traumatic: Apparently there's scientific proof that these games help!
Tyrants of the Underdark for 40 seems GOOOOOOOD.
Above and Below for $28 is an awesome deal!!!
Please everyone do yourself a favor and pick up Above and Below, especially for that price! Such a fantastic and beautiful game, one of my favorites.
[deleted]
Taluva's very good.  A good price on Imperial Assault if that works for you, and an X-Wing core set if you like cheap entry into the world of spending a lot of money.  The rest is pretty crap.
I want Imperial Assault so bad, especially at that price.  My only problem is "will I get it to the table enough?"   Sadly due to work schedules I don't have regular weekly game nights.  Biweekly if I'm lucky.  And I hear AI requires some dedication.
I bit. I picked up Pandemic Reign and Above and Below which were both on my list, threw in stocking stuffers that had low stock. I am officially done. No more need to watch Black Friday sales. 
There are like 11 board games, and out of that only **Imperial Assault** and **Above and Below** seem anything worth mentioning.
What does pre black Friday mean? Will there be a separate list of items on sale on black Friday? 
I don't know much else about it, but Volt Robot Battle Arena is by Emerson Matsuuchi of Specter Ops fame. Definitely looking into this one.
Dice Masters: Faerun Under Seige is one of the best sets to own along with a starter if you want a simple standalone set for it. Warning: If you don't like MTG, you won't like Dice Masters.
And they already have my stuff in transit. Amazing handling of this sale CSI! Wish every company was this amazing.
Anyone in Canada ever buy from CoolStuff? What is there shipping costs like?

Some good deals, but wondering if it would be worth it with the exchange rate and shipping. My guess is probably not.

The chances of me getting any of my games played 10 times in one year is slim, just due to the nature of how my game groups operate. Which is fine. But there's a few games I think I'd like to get played more often, and who's relatively light nature might lend them to being played more often, including:

**Quadropolis**
**Via Nebula**
**Honshu**
**Glen More**
I don't plan out a 10x10 because I tend to replay great games a lot anyway, here are my nickels and above thus far:

**Peloponnes**	17

**The Great Zimbabwe**	15

**Hanabi**	14

**Ricochet Robots**	14

**Age of Steam**	11

**Codenames**	9

Obviously, I'm a Euro gamer.  Problem is, nobody around me is.  Of my 6 "dimes" this year, 3 are solo games, one is Pandemic: Legacy, and one is Cribbage (the only game my wife will play with any regularity). #sadface
I'm doing 2x all games -challenge and I'm almost done. 4 plays left from my collection of 50 games. 
Is there an easy way to look back through past comments? I can't seem to find my 10x10 I posted in February.
Bora bora all the way. Beautiful and fun to play. Trajan is good but a bit dry. 
If you love Castles, Bora Bora is often cited as a more complicated version of the mechanics. This does not mean it is better; Castles is widely considered to be the superior design.

Trajan can feel like a collection of many mini-Euro games played at once, and if you like the idea of managing many interlocking pieces to master a full machine, this would be a good game to try. A very divisive game: many people think this is either Feld's best, or conversely, his most overrated game.

La Isla is one of his lightest games. If you want something that is easier to grasp and teach to others, this might be good. It is not nearly as satisfying as his meatier games in terms of strategy.


Special note: two of Feld's most popular games in the heavy euro community, **In the Year of the Dragon** and **Notre Dame** are receiving reprints in 2017, and are definitely worth waiting for. Based on past prices, they should retail for slightly over $30.
I haven't played all his games, but my favorite is Aquasphere, which you can usually find a pretty good deal on. 
Aside from what has been said already, since nobody tackled La Isla, I will.  It's a fun middle weight game with a good bit of depth.  For the dollar price (I think it usually goes for 15-25 online) it's a great pseudo tableau-building set collection game.  There's enough with placement on the board and the abilities on cards to keep it refreshing for a number of plays. I like it more than Rialto, which is mechanically different but roughly the same in complexity and length.  
**Oracle of Delphi** is the first Feld I will keep in my collection.  It's a wonderfully puzzly pickup and deliver/race game.  I am not typically a big fan of either pickup and deliver or race games but this one does it right.  The dice play/manipulation and unique character powers remind me of **The Voyages of Marco Polo**; another favourite of ours.

I also quite enjoy the theme and how it ties back to the gameplay...something I find absent in Feld's other games.  
Just tossing out some info here, but if you are willing to wait a month or so **Jórvík** is getting printed. Its a reskin of **Speicherstadt** + **Kaispeicher**
To me **Bora Bora** is the most epic, cutthroat, and also fiddly.  There is opportunity for a lot of blocking. The personal goals make it feel epic and tie all the mini games together really well, I love the personal goals. **Trajan** at 2 player is less cutthroat, and the mancala in effect takes on the feel of an engine builder to me because ideally you are developing a sequence of moves that chain together by reading into the future of your mancala.  It's a fun thinker in that way. Personally I love **Aquasphere** at 2, it's a much more restrictive and unforgiving game than bora bora or trajan, in the sense that if you aren't planning ahead well you can find yourself in situations where you feel like you have nothing you can do.  But i dare say it's the most elegant of the 3, many interconnected elements with a calculated dance feel like chess. The small moves of programming bots feels like positioning a pawn to me, and if played well there's lots of interaction, you either must or are very tempted to respond to what your opponent is doing.  Just trying to give some impressions of how they feel to engage with at 2 player.

You gotta give **Bruges** some love too. Lots of choices with cards and dice chugging. It's one of his lighter games but I absolutely adore it.
Unlike X-Wing and Armada which feel like tasters for a much bigger game, Imperial Assault really does feel like you're getting a hell of a lot of game right out of that one box. Should keep you going for a long time - plus there's an incoming app for co-op campaigning next year.
There is a fully playable campaign and Skirmish mode right out of the box, and you lose nothing other than having to use cardboard tokens for the Imperial "bosses".  Additional purchases grant you new skirmish maps, more minis, and more "stuff" for you and your players to use during your campaign.  You certainly do not lose out on anything aside from a broader pool of choices by not buying into the expansions.
So a resounding yes! Thanks guys!
I had the same fear as you when I first purchased Imperial Assault. I was concerned that with FFG's constant release of figures and expansions I would be compelled to buy them all and put way too much money into it, or I would feel like I'm not getting the "full" game. 

I'm happy to say that the base game has tons of replay value and as other posters have mentioned, you are definitely not missing anything critical. Especially if you will primarily be playing the campaign.  Don't feel rushed to have the "complete set" unless you plan on playing competitive Skirmish. 
Yes
So, you get cardboard tokens for some of the main enemies that you'll probably want to upgrade to plastic with like $30-50 of packs. But, that said, the campaign is my favorite part, the only part I play anymore. The base game has enough campaign for probably 20 couple hour sessions and you'll be more than happy. Plus, then you'll know if you want a big box expansion. 
I've bought the base game and played through the campaign once and did not think that it lacked anything, as it provided a fun experience, and I'm even considering running through the whole campaign a second time as what is provided in the base game is highly replayable (there are some 30 missions in the base game and you only play through 12 of them in a campaign)
I actually regret how much stuff I bought before playing.  I got almost ever mini expansion and 90% of them never even came up in my campaign.  It is a bit silly having little cardboard circles represent Han Solo while everyone else is a plastic figure, but it's not a big deal.

If you like it enough to play multiple times, it would be worth investing in for variability and to get some fun figures though, personally the game wasn't really for me so I blew my money for nothing.
I kinda think level 7 omega is he better choice if you just are going with base games. 
Core set on it's own should be fine. I went down a deep rabbit hole with Descent and while the additional boxes were fun and the extra bits appreciated, I kinda wish I had just stuck with the core and put that money into something else.
I've had it for a good 6 months now, at least, and the only extra content I bought was the boba fett figure pack. 

And I can say that I love it! I've never thought to myself that it's missing anything, or needs more. But I HAVE wanted more lol. 

So no, it's not necessary by any means, but if you're not strong you'll probably end up buying more eventually.  
If you're playing campaign then yes, there is more than enough game there. Most of the expansion stuff is more geared towards skirmish play.
I have played the full campaign twice with nothing but the base set and was not at all disappointed. Only now am I considering getting one of the big box expansions for some more variety. (note: I have not played skirmish)
Definitely! The core set has so much game in it!
Thanks for asking this question. I was wondering this myself and have been wanting to get this game.
Absolutely. Everything in the box will give many hours of campaign play for a decent number of people. The extras are all exactly that, unless you want to go into competitive skirmish.
Yes. It is a complete game right out of the box, and it will take you some time to get through a campaign.
I had a group start going through the campaign (we're 4 missions in now) and frankly I don't even see a compelling reason to buy any of the addition packs/sets.  We're not playing skirmish mode at all and we've already built the mission decks.  Many of the expansions do add extra "side quest" missions however you will only play through a small number of those during a single campaign (4 I think).  I got my copy of the base game in a trade and think the base game is well worth it.


I just posted about this, but can anyone here tell me what ally packs I would need to get if I wanted to replace all the tokens in the base game?
Cardhaus has great prices, great pre-order discounts,  great ding and dent program, great stock and service... but man this website pains me every time I have to use it.  I don't know if I want to click through 20+ pages...
I have been waiting on this! I just placed an order for Istanbul, Concordia, Onitama, Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, and Cacao for an even $130.00 and free shipping. Woo!
10% off pre-orders too.
Terra Mystica for $46.79 and 1830 for $56.70 are great prices.
Thanks so much for posting this, Cardhaus is typically my online store of choice and their low prices + free shipping ( if you go over $125 ), no sales tax, and the 10% BF discount made it worth it for me to place a large order just now. Also the added benefit now that I don't have to look out for BF sales any longer at least when it comes to board games.
I don't know if It's exactly what you're looking for but you could check out Mansions of Madness second edition and the Road to Legend app for Descent 2e. Both are from Fantasy Flight games and available on Android.
WSIG: This or **A Feast for Odin**?

>Tabletoppers range from the casual Cards Against Humanity player to the Pandemic Legacy player to the 5e player.  We lie somewhere in between the first two. 

Oh god, what does this even mean? Are you trying to say DnD 5E is the heaviest possible board game?


May god have mercy on your soul for what you have created.  I have no other polite words.  
Not my kind of game whatsoever, but congrats on reaching your funding goal.
I.... I'm lost for words
Good luck with the game. This looks almost exactly like exploding kittens.
Who backs this...
That art all looks lifted from the internet. Do you have rights on it?
To be honest, I'm kinda disappointed in the level of derision you're receiving in this thread, and I'm impressed by how you've responded to it with a cool head.

From the sound of it, this is certainly not the game for me. The mechanics don't grab me, and these days, I find excessive usage of memes tiresome, *especially* outside of the internet. I can say with some confidence that I probably wouldn't enjoy this.

But I think criticism is not the same as derision, and I'm sorry you're receiving so much of the latter. Congratulations on your funding! I hope you receive good criticism in addition to the derision--so you can continue to grow as a designer. ☺️
Mythic Battles: Pantheon is easily one of the most professionally handled KS I've backed so far. The minis are gorgeous and the gameplay looks interesting as well. Not to mention, you definitely get more than you pay for. That free titan miniature is amazing, haha.
I'm a backer as well, just for the plastic. It will be easy enough to use the minis in another game system. However, if this was the *only* game I was getting for dungeon crawling, tactical combat, or whatever, I definitely would not recommend DS as the go-to game of choice to scratch that itch from what we've seen so far. 
I backed DS for £1 but will definitely not up my pledge. The game looks like it's being put together between updates. It's too much of an investment for something like that.

Mythic Battles: Pantheon, on the other hand, is the second iteration of the game (the original being a token based game called Mythic Battles). If anything, I would go for MB: P - may as well get a game with thoroughly tested gameplay.
Guess I'll stand up for dark souls then,  personally I have loved what I've seen so far of souls,  the combat looks very tactical and the only things they've really been changing are the systems that allow that combat to happen,  and things like traps which used backer input. Every person who has demoed the game at conventions has said its great to play.  
. .  
That's aside from the fact that they are vastly different game styles,  one is a miniature skirmish game,  the other a dungeon crawl. If you are simply backing for the plastic then go for mythic (then again you get a lot of minis which ds too) ,  if (like me) you are looking for a game to play then decide which style you are looking for.  

Also I don't know if you've seen the update but they are running a 2 hour game play stream for dark souls tomorrow so you might be a bit premature in making any decision until you've seen that.  
I just do a few overhands and generally don't worry about it too much. 

Or put them all face down on the table and mix them around. 
Mash shuffles (easier if sleeved) and pile shuffles.
I get two people to shuffle each deck. Especially useful in games where you have to shuffle decks of 3 or 4 cards. It stops the first person subconsciously knowing where cards are in the deck.
Throw them all up in the air and then pick them all up. 
I prefer to scatter shuffle. Deal out the cards face down in any number of piles, depending on the size of the deck. Pick up the piles and stack them in any order. Do that once or twice and you're golden. 
[Fisher Yates shuffle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) and a good source of entropy for your RNG.
FEAST NOW MY BROTHERS
Grr. They did jack the price $15. I mean, I can't blame them... the game is selling like hot cakes. So more power to them.

I think I can wait a few more months... I'm guessing it will be on sale again at some point or once the rush dies down.

It also helps that my friend has a copy that I'll probably play several more times in the coming weeks.

But it is a great game! I'll get it someday!
Ha, beat me to it. Saw it before I left for work an hour ago, ordered, popped in here to make a topic and didn't see yours till after I had. Doing the lord's work!
Ordered! It may be worth it for some to use Cardhaus' ten percent off sale (which I'm told begins today). Game is 85 there, so like 77.50 with the sale, but you have to get to 125 for free shipping.

I got 2.5% off at CSI so it was worth it for me, with the 100 minimum for shipping. 
Sees that A Feast for Odin is back on Coolstuff. Bikes 10 miles in the rain the day before Thanksgiving to OFLGS to buy. 
Thanks for the tip!  Fantastic game.  Just picked up a second copy to give as a gift.
Risk Legacy, the first such 'legacy' board game, was designed so the box opened on a hinge, like a briefcase. That's not the point. What was brilliant was that they had placed a sticker (not an easily removable one) on the edge of the box where the lid fully closes. 

The seal says:  
> WARNING:  
> What is done cannot be undone.

In order to open the game, you are required to break that seal. 

This is incredible from a design standpoint because it embodies the entire theme of the 'legacy' aspect of the game, where the results of actions taken in one game persist and affect future games. 
I am a fan of the Onirim 2nd edition box.  The inside is nice.  And I liked the classic games in the wooden boxes that looked like books.  That's how my Stratego is, but they have risk and monopoly and stuff like that.

Now a possible unpopular opinion..the FFG coffin cases.  The huge boxes like descent 1e, starcraft, or Twilight Emperium.  I loved those damned thingz
**Mafia De Cuba** is pretty cool because the box is part of the gameplay. It's a cigar box with a "false bottom" that the players lift up to pick their role or steal the diamonds.
**Burgle Bros** should get an award for packing everything into the box with *no air at all*. It's genuinely impressive.
I think the Grimoire wood box of **War of the Ring Collector's Edition** is probably the one I'd go with, and I wish I hadn't missed our on it.

Not what you probably mean, but I really like the Sierra Madre Games small boxes lately.   They pack the contents tight in there and you get a lot of game play.  It is the antithesis of the "light game in a box full of air" (my example if this would be *Nations*).
Cool packaging excites me (it's my job). Star Wars Destiny starter sets are super exciting! I love the precision, the usefulness, the reusability. 
Mythe - it has a popup board. Like a storybook popup.
**Onitama** has a cool box packaging 
I love the Secret Hitler packaging. When playing it a couple weeks ago, the group I was with asked if it was an "old" game because of the packaging. 

The wooden box makes it even more awesome. 
The new Harry Potter deck building game. You start out by opening one of seven boxes that correspond to the individual books. Inside are cards for a basic game. Once you learn the rules, it's on to book 2 and the second component box, and so on. 

On top of this, there is a nice insert with spots to store all the parts. 

Props to Lords of Waterdeep, as well, for its part storage insert. 
so for currency - [Meeple Source](https://www.meeplesource.com/products.php?filter=metal+coins) and Campaign Coins have metal coins of various denominations.
For cards and pieces The Game Crafter lets you make custom cards and buy parts - they are ok quality.
Drive Thru cards also does custom cards
NT: no links since I'm at work and can't get around the firewall
Acquire is my favorite game, and this looks awesome. Have you looked into custom poker chips for money? They make transactions a bit faster. I second using one of the online card companies for the stocks. They are typically standard playing card size. Some have templates where you can drop in image files which makes design pretty easy. As for the company markers, maybe just put a small square/rectangular dowel on the bottom of each marker which will fit between two tiles snugly.
I like that everything you do feels thematic, and it never really feels conflicty. We all just focus on our business, and see who wins. I understand there are complaints about how the game actually ends, but it hasn't been a problem for us yet. I do wonder if the community has any variants to "solve" this or not.
Like /u/shineuponthee said, the theme shines really heavily in this game. I love aging the grapes, I love planting cards, I love the different seasons allowing/disallowing you to do certain things, I love the components (especially the grapes), I love the hand and money management. I absolutely adore this game.

The grape components might be my favorite thing, that's not to dismiss the rest of the game, I just think they're spectacular. 

If you end up enjoying this game, I'd recommend Tuscany: EE, because my favorite thing about that game is actually the personal customization you can do with the structure cards. It adds a lot to the game that I think makes it even better than it already is.
My favorite thing about Viticulture is that rooster meeple!
I like the worker placement mechanics - you have a small pool of workers and different actions for different seasons (and multiple spots that may be used depending on player count).  You could easily use them up to soon and not have enough to do work later in the year, or you could be stingy and then get blocked (meaning you only get to but a small amount of money as compensation for the lost actions). 

Of course, I play the original edition with the Tuscany expansion and thus use a 4 season board.  I think this is one of those titles that really needs the expansion to make it feel complete or make it replayable (like Pandemic + On the Brink or Eldritch Horror + Forsaken Lore... or, um... Cards Against Humanity + lots and lots of alcohol... shame I don't drink).
As someone who used to work at FLGS,  this can happen quite a bit depending on who they deal with.  I remember Codenames being on backorder.
Viticulture was in between printings for months.  Mansions of Madness ran out almost everywhere in the last week and a half.  If your LGS only uses one or two distributors and doesn't often ship from other warehouses this can be totally legit.  However Mansions was pretty readily available before that so I'm not sure if I buy that reasoning but I don't know who is their supplier and how often they order.  


I haven't played Tyrants myself, but from watching Gray Elephant Gaming's play of it, I thought that it was reasonable. It rewarded every aspect of the game. I don't see the issue with a player winning if he is the only one taking advantage of a source of points.
I've played the game dozens of times, and I think your suggested changes would make the game worse.

This isn't just an area control game - card buys and promotions provide alternate paths to victory, giving the game much more variety. It would get boring fast if all you were doing was just fighting for locations with super straightforward cardplay.

Not knowing what folks exactly have scored is also part of the fun. It would be very tedious if you could count up someone's points and say 'hey, this person has promoted 42 points worth of cards, we should really gang up on them'. It encourages you to really pay attention to what's happening in the game.
So, you played the game once, missed the importance of a core strategy and think the game rules need to be changed?

I'm going to say the rules don't need to be changed and nor does it need to be more transparent. You see what card goes to the inner circle as it happens; if it's the base cards then you know there's a couple of points banked if you see they consistently promote bought cards then you know there's a territory or two's worth in there for every big card.

Most people will only be promoting maybe a half dozen cards in total, unless they go all in on the strategy in which case you should have tried to prevent them getting the promote cards from the marketplace or rushed to the end of the game with the conquest cards.

Give it a few more games as once you know what you're doing on the board section it's pretty interesting keeping track of what other players are doing.
**Carcassonne** will be at my Thanksgiving table, as it is every year. Toss the pieces in a draw bag, divvy up the meeples, done. I keep my meeples in tiny separate ziplocs for quicker doling out. It can tend to sprawl though, so I guess it misses that point for you.
**Pandemic: The Cure**  Dice game.  About 30 minutes to play.  Setup is less than 5 mins.
I'm gearing up my lineup for Thanksgiving this year and will bring the following. Note* my family is NOT all that geeky or into games, so bear that in mind.

 - **Codenames**
 - **Dr. Eureka**
 - **Say Anything**
 - **Telestrations**
 - **Cash n Guns**
 - **Safranito**
 - **The Resistance**

**Via Nebula** is super fast to setup, just player boards and tokens and one set of tiles to randomize. Average footprint, but easy setup and very low entry point. 
I suggest you post some screens and explanations of the functionality. Since it's iPad only I'm unable to even preview it in the store since I'm on my iPhone.
Bring your own snacks and drinks.  (There is a Kroger grocery store not far from the convention center.)  Way cheaper than vending machines.

Plan for breaks between events.  Make sure to give yourself an hour or more for lunch and dinner.

Give yourself at least 8 hours to walk through the vendor hall.  Maybe more if you like to stop and talk a lot.

Vendors will have cool offers and deals, but don't expect to see massive discounts everywhere.

There is a food court with typical fast-food stuff.  Across the street is a Max and Erma's, which has higher quality Americana.  (Sometimes good for your belly to go over there and just have a soup and salad.)  There is a building called the North Market that is a half block away from the convention center that has a lot of good food vendors.

You will pay a lot of money for mediocre food from any of the stands in and just outside of the vendor hall.

Pre-register for events early, because the hot ones will sell out.  You can buy generic tokens that will get you in to any event (but only if there are available seats.)  Frequently, RPGs will reserve a seat or two for generic tokens.  Big companies have reserved areas and are always running events, so as long as you aren't picky, you can show up with generics and get a seat at any kind of game.

The convention is 24 hours a day.  But please, get sleep and shower.  Being tired and cranky sucks.  Being smelly is rude.

When I fly, I pack an extra bag to bring home my haul.  There are also shipping centers where you can box up your purchases and ship them.  (If you are driving, make sure to leave room in your car!)
Here is a nice repository of info that someone posted over at BGG: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1626433/origins-2017-faqs-post
Can we setup a Columbus board gamer meetup? I'm local and will be there unless something prevents me. I know some good spots for drinks and food and can drive.
8 is a high player count, and a lot of the games on your lists don't go that high. So, I'll toss out a few suggestions:

Viticulture Essential Edition

Eight-Minute Empire: Legends

Beyond Baker Street

Dead of Winter

T.I.M.E. Stories

Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy

The Resistance

Ascension

Covert

Tragedy Looper

Black Orchestra

Royals

New Bedford

Lotus

Kingsburg

Diamant
Are you me? I'm looking for basically the same thing, same price range, own/like a lot of the same games. I'll come back to this thread a bit later... :P
Terraforming Mars, A Feast for Odin, and Great Western Trail are probably the three best new games from Essen.  
Seconding (Thirding? Fourthing?) **Great Western Trail**, it has a lot of elements but they all work really well together and it's such a fun game to play at any player count! I also loved **Fabled Fruit** and **Cry Havoc**
Probably not the most popular, but I was pretty excited for **Mythe** to come out.  Beautiful kids game with a pop-up board!  Can't wait to pick it up and try it with my little one.
Arkham horror lcg, seafall
I just received Great Western Trail and am excited to try it this weekend. I too have heard nothing but good things.

I'm expecting Cottage Garden to be delivered on Friday. I've heard mixed reviews where I think people were hoping it would have the economic piece from Patchwork as well, but it doesn't. After watching the rahdo run through it looked like a perfect game to play with my wife during dinner.

I'm still waiting to get my copy of A Feast For Odin, and have heard a lot of positive responses.
I would be greatful to recieve such generosity. I am a gamer who works hard to take care of 2 kids and works full time. Diapers and formula don't allow me to buy many new things so this would be a treat especially since it's one player. 
Thanks for doing this! This is great!
I'm not a fan of the game, but this is a lovely gesture!

It's things like this and the generally chilled out atmosphere of this subreddit that really make this a good place to chat about boardgames :)
As much as I would love a free copy, I'll let others get a chance to get it. Awesome of you to do this though! 
Thanks! Pretty cool to do this!
Am not in the US so can't partake, but wanted to say made me smile - such a nice gesture. 

Happy Thanksgiving for tomorrow to you OP, and to all those here who celebrate!
Thank you for putting this together! Happy Holidays
ohh shiny.
This is awesome and you're awesome, thanks!
Will do, thanks for the opportunity! :D
Hey I just want to say this is real cool. As a student I don't have the money flowing so my games are well played (I do have people who wants to play in abundance). Who ever wins this is cool of you! Have a great TG
This is a great gesture. Thanks for bringing people some happiness :)
Thanks for doing this, such a kind gesture.
This is very kind of you. If you haven't given this away yet, I really appreciate it. 
This is one of my favorite games and I love the DC universe, but after looking at the card art in question, I realized I wasn't sure of the origin of the art either. 

Using reverse google search, it's apparent that the location of the battle was Bludhaven, best known as the city where Nightwing operates out of after leaving Batman and Gotham. Eventually Bludhaven is the site of a major battle in Infinite Crisis that leaves the city in ruins, but this specific picture is not from that battle. 

Shortly after Infinite Crisis, Final Crisis begins, and Darkseid takes control of Bludhaven, and uses it as a strategic staging bunker. This artwork is a panel in the comic showing what Bludhaven looked like at the time of this occupation. Unfortunately, I'm not certain why there are dalmatians, but the comics of interest are Infinite Crisis, Infinite Crisis Aftermath: The Battle for Bludhaven, and Final Crisis. Specifically, Final Crisis #4 contains the panel featuring this artwork.

Sorry I couldn't be more specific, but I recommend making a new post on /r/DCcomics for more info if you're curious, and referencing [this image](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/File:Bludhaven_Strike_Force_aftermath_01.jpg).
**Arcadia Quest** strikes me as something that will go straight to your almost never play section.

**Galaxy Trucker** seems well suited for your needs, but I hear the game can be divisive. 

**Lords of Waterdeep** is on your heavily played list and the expansion is a pretty strong improvement on the game.

**Love Letter** is in my opinion a lack luster game. I bought Loot Letter for 2.50 recently and I think the game is only worth around that much. Even then, I live in SoCal  so pretty much everyone would rather play **Tien Len** if we have 4 people.

**Games that have made the biggest splash for my casual group of friends:**

* **Bohnanza:** This game has an incredible amount of trading interaction. It gets mentioned a lot, but I feel not nearly enough for how consistent a crowd pleaser it is.

* **Codenames:** I can kind of see this game getting tiring, but the first couple plays are always amazing and considering you can find it at $15 from time to time, it's an easy addition to any collection.

* **Say Anything:** This one really depends on your friends. That being said, I've had lots of success and I regularly see it for under $15.

* **Race for the Galaxy:** Cheap and quick. The game length will keep your friends willing to play after the first couple very difficult learning sessions. The inherent depth of the game will keep you as a host interested.

* **Ticket to Ride:** Its reputation is deserved. Although Splendor is not far removed from it.

* **Survive! Escape from Atlantis:** I'm not in love with it. I feel like its a bit too simple for me, but my friends love it, so it might be a good fit for you.
**Cosmic Encounter** is fantastic, and I don't see it listed in your games. Focuses on alliances, negotiation, bluffing, and each alien race has a distinct ability that changes the way you approach each match. Definitely best for 4-5 players, but with expansions you can get up to 8.
**Light**

* I think Love Letter can be a lot of fun for a few rounds here and there. For the price, I'd say there's no reason not to take a chance on it.

* I recently discovered [Guillotine](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/116/guillotine) and would recommend it, again, especially considering the price.

**Medium**

* Given that your friends started out with Monopoly, you should check out [Power Grid](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid). Kind of a similar theme but... you know... actually fun. (Just kidding, Monopoly is actually still a guilty pleasure of mine).

* Admittedly, I haven't gotten to play this one a lot yet but I still feel pretty comfortable recommending [Castles of Burgundy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/84876/castles-burgundy). I think it falls pretty nicely in between Light and Medium in terms of complexity.
I'm curious, whats everyone's thoughts on legendary
>as I was playing No Man's Sky earlier this year I became obsessed with the idea of replicating this kind of game-play    

Sadist.    

All honesty, considering how that all went down, might want to use a student comparison. Maybe spelunky, since, ya know... People liked it.
It's an interesting idea, though 'a board game version of no man's sky' isn't something I'd call a selling point. 
Have her watch a review and ask her.

If she dislikes dice games because of the randomness it might make her dislike the pulling of a token out of the bag because it can swing from a +1 to a - 3 on normal difficulty.

Other than that I felt it was pretty immersive and fun game play.
Arkham has a strong teamwork focus.  When we play, it's more focused around winning/mechanics than it is about the story.  I think there's a good chance it would be a decent fit.
There are moments when you could say things like "Ahh!!, grab your baseball bat and get in here, there's a ghoul and I failed the evasion check, you have to save me!" or "Now hold still...I'm gonna try to shoot that Fiend, but if I miss and hit you you're dead...  Well don't miss!  I'll try not to! Do you have any cards you can ditch to help??" or "I don't want to go down in the Basement, YOU go first!  Me?  But I'm almost Insane, what if there's something scary down there??"
My gf and I have played the campaign and had a great time with it!  I suggest playing on "easy" mode personally.  Some may say this isn't the correct way to play it but I found the standard difficulty to be a bit much and it kind of soured the enjoyment a bit for us. Anyways, it's an awesome co-op experience and discussion and teamwork are a must. The story is great and the deck building is fun and the chaos bag concept changes it up and works well.  She was skeptical at first but ended up liking it a lot more than she thought she would.  It's worth it!  Good luck with the persuading!
My partner loves T.I.M.E. Stories, but Arkham LCG really flopped with her. The story elements weren't enough to make up for the resource management/card play that she didn't enjoy. :(
This is my most anticipated game of next year.  Robinson Crusoe is great, and it seems like Ignacy has put in the effort to make First Martians something special.  

Really excited for this game! Recently read an excerpt from Ignacy on the facebook page about the playtesting of First Martians. Thought it was interesting so I'll copy it.

"First Martians is being developed using the Robinson Crusoe engine. Both games use the same basic mechanism—you spend 1 Action Pawn and you roll a dice or you spend both of your Action Pawns and that’s an auto success.
For example, you go for the Explore action, you spend 1 Action Pawn, so you grab 3 green dice and roll them. Most likely you will succeed with your action (there are 5 success icons), most likely you will have an adventure (5 adventure icons), and there’s a chance you’ll be wounded (3 wound icons).
Even though all adventures in the deck are bad, players often want these encounters. They are eager to see what will happen. Will they get lost in the woods? Find a cursed hut? Stumble upon a corpse of a dead goat? So many cool things might happen!
They roll the dice, they have adventures, the game is rich in stories and theme. Robinson Crusoe at its best!
Let’s visit Mars.

There’s been an interesting issue for me to deal with. The playtesters don’t roll the dice. They perform all their actions with 2 Action Pawns and they do everything, literally everything they can, not to roll the dice.
The last test I ran? They didn’t plant the seeds in the greenhouse, the plants didn’t grow (obviously!), and in the second scenario the players will most likely die of hunger, because food reserves are really low. And yet they managed to just achieve the scenario’s objective, the absolute minimum they needed to achieve to finish the game. They did nothing more, no preparations were made for the next game.

‘Why didn’t you plant the seeds?’, I asked after the test game.

‘We had no time for that.’

‘You had the time. You kept using 2 Action Pawns for your actions. You could have easily split them, roll the dice and do the planting’, I pointed out.

‘I am not rolling these fucking dice’, I heard in response (and that’s a quote, just in case you wondered).

‘You will die of starvation in the campaign’s second scenario!’

‘This is space. I am not rolling these fucking dice in space.’
***
There is no logic in that. This is nothing I could have predicted when I was building the game. There is nothing in the rules that could be changed to resolve this issue. This is just a purely emotional problem. Having adventures on the Cursed Island is exciting and cool. Having adventures on Mars is…
‘I am not rolling these fucking dice.’"
App driven but all the cards in the app are there physically..?!? Why is everything going app driven >:(
Just remember they will probably ship it about 5 months late. 
I hated Robinson Crusoe but I'm willing to try this hoping the theme and (hopefully) far better written rules speak to me more. Plus I love Ignacy as person so I feel compelled to try harder to like this game. 
Can't wait!!!!
You're a real friend to put that much thought in what he could enjoy. I'm sniffling a bit here.
friend sounds like the majority non-gaming kids and adults I meet on a regular basis.  But usually they are too afraid to play something as complicated as "Tsuro".  Maybe board games just aren't his thing?  He he expressed interest and asked to play a game on his own?
I don't know that I'd recommend Splendor. As easy as it is to learn, it's difficult to play against people who don't think several moves ahead while you do. The disparity may really stick out there. Instead I'd recommend Jaipur which has a similar feel, but shaves down the choices a bit. (Basically the decision tree is much smaller on any given turn with Jaipur.)

Might also check out The Grizzled for some co-op fun.
I would recommend Star Realms as an easy to pick up deckbuilder. The rules are simple, and the individual turns aren't too long or complex. I especially like the ability to go competitive or co-op. It's been a relatively easy game to share with those unfamiliar, regardless of their gaming experience.
Castles of Mad King Ludwig is super easy to learn, but offers a lot of game play for a lighter-to-medium Euro. Spyrium is another easy to learn Euro that offers some fun game play. Both of them are fairly inexpensive, both are rare auction games that work well with 2 players, and both offer more game play than the easy-to-learn rules would lead you to expect.
>He doesn't take the time to learn the rules

I don't mean to be rude, but is this because of his disability or because of a personal preference? You make it sound like the latter. 

If that's the case, then my response is the following: When I play with people who can't be bothered to pay attention to rules it is a supreme bummer and they usually don't get invited back. It's especially bad if we're playing in a larger group because other people's time is being wasted and dragged out by someone who doesn't want to co-operate. If he doesn't want to learn the rules of a game, he's not ready to play the game. Ask if he would be able to play a game without smoking pot, and see if that helps anything.

If that's not the case: Then it might be worthwhile trying out abstracts and filler games and then moving up from there. Battle Line, Jaipur, and Mr. Jack Pocket are some good 2-player games with few rules and enough randomness that the more skilled player doesn't have a complete advantage. 
I have really enjoyed the few times I've played Five Tribes. I've only ever played it with my son and nephew, who aren't the most strategic thinkers, and it wasn't a complete blowout each time. The mechanics are very easy to grasp, and each player gets a quick reference sheet as well.
I have a couple general suggestions:

1) When one player is a lot better than the other in terms of strategy, high luck games help, too -- it evens out the wins/losses. And it makes things a bit more interesting for the better player, too, because you're struggling against luck and the game as you play, not just against the other player. Examples of this are card games like **Jaipur** and **Lost Cities**.

2) He might have better luck with euros because they try to have streamlined rule sets, as opposed to more Ameritrashy games with lots of rule exceptions. Something to keep in mind when purchasing new game: read the rules, if there are lots of little exceptions give it a pass?

If you guys can handle **Castles of Burgundy**, I think **7 Wonders: Duel** should work. It plays in 45 mins to an hour and the turns all revolve around doing the same thing (drafting a card from the card pyramid).
I don't know if this is too light, but I've really enjoyed **Quadropolis**, which was released this year is something I would recommend. The rules are fairly straightforward, but the decisions are very difficult. But if you want to just play it as a quick, fun, no thought here, style of game you can. I've played it with people who prefer heavier Euros, and lighter Ameritrash games, and I lent it to someone who played it with his sons (15 and 12?), and everyone has enjoyed it.
Here is the full break down of the episode.  Let me know what you guys think of our podcast!

Host Tim Jennette (Metal Meeple) and co-host Matt RoBear start the episode with a few board game first impressions for Mennonite Manners, Lost Cities, The Voyages of Marco Polo, and The game of 49. Next, they discuss proper spoiler etiquette, toys inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame, the first board gaming table ever: the Playtable, and finish off the episode with their top 5 favorite cereals!
Hey, I'm in the USA at 37916. I recently compiled a rather long list of games I want and found the best price from either amazon or sellers on BGG. I can't for the life of me narrow it down to a single game to ask about deals on, so instead I'll ask further about where you look for deals. Will check out the site you already linked. Not necessarily looking for a specific price range, more for great deals for the games on my list to make acquiring all the items on it more feasible on a shorter timescale.
I'm looking for Space Hulk: Death Angel - Deathwing Space Marine Pack. My zipcode is 75226. I'd love to pay at or under the $20 mark shipped.

Note: This may be impossible, but we all have our dreams.
WTB Safe Return Doubtful $50 +
This is probably more appropriate for /r/boardgamedeals
12 and 14 will be able to play 7 wonders, but not necessarily teach themselves it. That said, it's more complex at 2. I'd suggest getting them 7 wonders Duel though.

Merchant of Venus (at least the classic rules) are fine at 12, again, teach them to play, they'll be fine. 

Around 10-12 or so, kids have all the mental acuity to develop strategy, and are actually quite a bit better at absorbing rules than adults, but, emotional maturity can sometimes be lacking, so avoid games with huge "Gotchas" or "Vote to Win" games like City of Horror/Lifeboats. This is magnified in a sibling, especially non-twin situation.

If you go check out Meeple's like Us, and their accessibility teardown, look at the cognitive sections about emotional accessibility.

Lastly, kids generally prefer owning things over sharing things. Give them 2 games, one to one, and one to the other.
I don't think games should have an explicitly educational element to them, especially not for players at that age. Playing any game but the most simplistic (Life, Chutes and Ladders) requires intellectual effort and will improve their logical reasoning and decision making skills.

At age 12, they can basically play anything. Go with a good "gateway" game. **7 Wonders** will work, but **Ticket to Ride**, **Pandemic**, **Dominion**, are all great choices.
**TimeLine** - it's a trivia series it might be a bit dense but it's super easy to play

**Wits and Wagers** - an easier trivia game that has redemption but you'll be learning less in that game than in Timeline.
Why do you think 7 Wonders would be too much for them? The suggested age range is 10+. 12-14 years old is about middle school, only the super complex games should be too much to handle, if even that. What kind of themes do they like?
Carcassonne is great for this age (and above). Not super-educational but lots of strategy involved and lots of cheap expansions available if you want to add on. Codenames, Dixit and Mysterium have good problem-solving, deduction and creativity elements. 
Pandemic is at least vaguely realistic and is a good intro to coop games (or Forbidden Island/Desert)
12 and 14 is old enough to play literally anything.  So go with either/both:

A theme they really connect with

An experience you've seen they connect with when gaming
While i don't like 7 wonders it's listed as 10+, you could probably buy it for them without worries if you also teach it to them. 

Alternatively, Timeline makes for a nice add on. You can choose what topic you think would be interesting. It's a fun game though light. Luckily it's fairly inexpensive also. 

You could get them sushi go as an intro to drafting games.

There are plenty of excellent games for that age range and below. I'm confused if you want something that strives to be educational or fun first and educational if possible. The reason i ask is because most games are educational in some manner, but studies show that the act of play is the most beneficial aspect of games at young ages. I'd go for good fun first with a theme you think will hook them. What are they interested in?
**War Games** are great for teaching history and geography (and not nearly as aggressive as you might think).

Different types of **train games**, from the lighter fair to the heavier are great to teach geography, math and economics.
Catan?  Pretty straight forward, but you get to flex your brain a bit with strategy and making deals.
Something like 7 Wonders, yet not as complicated, you say? Sounds like Sushi Go to me. 
I'd say **Ticket to Ride** would stand out as a clear choice.  It's one of the most simple and elegant gateways to learn and play, plus some nicely subtle educational bits in learning the geography and working the math.  It's quite family friendly, rarely nasty, and more funny than mean when someone does drop a block.  I think you couldn't go wrong with TTR.
[Game of the States?](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2485/game-states)
What about something like Evolution? It has some basic biology concepts in it, plus the art's great. Might be up their alley if they like animals.

In a similar vein, I haven't played it yet, but I've ordered a card game called Birds of a Feather. It's about birding and uses lots of real bird species, but doesn't seem to be terribly complex.
Look into genius games. They have games that teach chemistry and biology in a fun way. There is usually a kickstarter running but amazon carries some. Ion,covalence,peptide are the names I remember.
For what it's worth, my kid is 8 and we play.... 7 Wonders Duel, Castles of Burgundy, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Takenoko, Zooloretto, Patchwork, Eight Minute Empire, Forbidden Desert, CV, Codenames, and Paperback with no issues. I probably missed a few. But yeah, age doesn't necessarily mean much when it comes to gaming. What you need to figure out is what kind of mechanics they like. I'd recommend grabbing a few of the <$20 games (there's more out there than you might think!) and see what sticks.
The reason I would rank these like I did is that Level 7 has directional line of sight and there more components you have to manage more token and upkeep more things as the overseer. 

You could swap Imperial Assault and Descent around with fiddliness based on what you consider fiddily. IA has a bit more fiddliness with managing the deck of agendas and missions. The rebels and empire swap taking turns, whereas in Descent the campaign is laid out and in a more linear path with branches you choose and the heroes all take their turn then the overlord. The heroes in Descent also get to choose a class deck and not a specific role like in Imperial Assault. 

So thats why I ranked them as follows:

1. Level 7: Omega Protocol

2. Imperial Assault

3. Descent
Descent co-op with the app was least fiddly for us. Imperial Assault with the 1 vs many and managing your whole campaign added complexity. The line of sight for imperial assault is also more involved than Descent. 

While Level 7 has an interesting system for the Overseer, we were constantly looking through the rule book for answers. The rule book isn't that great. Line of sight and range took some getting used to but wasn't too bad. Lots of posts on the internet about it. 

I hear the new Conan game is quite smooth. A good system for balancing both sides and nothing too complex when it comes to using items or abilities. Check it out. 
Haven't played Level 7 but the other two aren't especially fiddly. You would probably want Descent over Imperial Assault for full coop play. 
    
I also suggest looking at Zombicide: Black Plague. Similar feel and probably one step lower on the fiddly scale. 
**Dungeon!** is pretty light but in the same vein. It's been redesigned recently with more modern, cartoony artwork that will probably appeal to the kids. ([BGG Link](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1339/dungeon))
Mice and Mystics works perfectly for 6 & 8 year old kids. I think it's too simple for adults and lacks any important decisions and depth but I think it's great for kids.
Wait...lighter and easier than HeroQuest? That's one of the lightest and easiest there is! 
A few options that aren't really close in game play, but might work anyway: **Welcome to the Dungeon**, **Castle Panic**, and **Escape**. 

I agree with other posters about **Mice and Mystics**. Especially since it will prepare them for **Descent** when they are older!
**Talisman**
Both my kids (nearly 7 and 4) love playing **Heroscape**. I bought a box of old stuff off eBay. The basic rules are perfect for the 7 year old and the 4 year old loves helping put the terrain together. They make an enormous map and we roam around it with ninjas, dinosaurs and world war 2 soldiers. It's bonkers but super fun.
I'd suggest **Mechs vs Minions**.

The game is easy to learn and fun. The older one will have a blast playing it. The younger one might need help at first, especially reading cards and on programming but that won't be an issue because of the cooperative nature of the game.
Conan is my Heroquest replacement. I played a ton of Heroquest in the 90's. I've never found a game that fit that same niche until I got Conan. It's open, simple, thematic, and tons of fun. I've read a lot of comments from people on BGG who have had great results with kids in the 8 year old range. 

HOWEVER, the artwork is certainly more adult oriented. For Europeans like my family, this is a non-issue. If you're American, your family may not care for the near-nudity.

The explanation of Longhorn (39) was kind of amazing -- I've never had someone paint a picture of the mechanics and gameplay experience of a game so thoroughly using just words. Many other thoughtful descriptions for the other games, too.

Great video overall, looking forward to more!
I love that Suz's list is so different from the others. Oftentimes you get a feeling that everyone is taking suggestions from the same pool of games. I love that she seeks out hard-to-find games (like Steam Rollers) and sheds more light on them. 
I'm really enjoying this list. It is pretty refreshing to see a list that varies this much from the norm, and I like Suzanne's presentation style and personality a lot.
I like that her choices are quite unique and well explained. What I don't like is that she tries to funny way too much.
I don't mind the scripted humor. It was kept to a minimum and the videos flowed well between games.  I really enjoy this list. It's different and well thought out.
Hmm, seeing some of the comments on this thread I went in not expecting to like this, but I found her well-spoken and clear. Scripting works for her, and I prefer that personally to some of the useless banter Tom and the others have in their videos. Liked that she had different ideas than the other DT folks. 

Her humor was a *little* cringey at points, but it was minimal and nowhere *near* the over-the-top cringe of Chaz Marler. His "personality" really turns me off. Overall, neat video. Will probably watch more by her in the future.
you know I'm not crazy for the dice tower, but i gotta give it to Zee/Sam/Tom that they don't add bad theatrics.
"wow, that was so hard, I hope i can keep this up" we're not 8. we know this prerecorded. scripted jokes aren't your (or Chaz's) thing. Just explain why you like things and give more reasons than Sam's "I didn't play it as much". 
Suzanne is hands down the most enjoyable personality on TDT. Doesn't subscribe to the overwhelming group think that surrounds the hobby and offers fair and well considered opinions of her own. She doesn't have that greasy salesman vibe that TDT is getting really bad for. 
Imperial Settlers (#38 on the list) always looks intriguing to me. But when I read reviews on it, it seems like razing out buildings from other players is a key part of the game. I don't mind competitive or cutthroat games in general, but having an engine building game with that nasty of a mechanic seems like it might be a little harsh to play. What do folks who own it think?
[deleted]
I don't know what it is, but I find her grating and obnoxious.  I had to turn it off.  She's trying too hard for the "I'm so awkward isn't that funny?"    
Well, she definitely has more of a scripted style but I enjoyed her video because she managed to stay focused and talked about different games than the regular DT crew (who I always enjoy watching). 

On a side note top 50 lists (or less) make more sense. When you are trying to rank 88 vs 87 it becomes a lot less about which is really your favorite game, but how you feel at this precise moment. *Moment*, not even year or month. This also explains the insane volatility we see in these top 100 lists. The top 10s usually stay the same and as you go up in numbers it becomes meaningless.

[My BGG collection](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/179jfkla), I have standard Catan as well but couldn't find it on BGG

1. Ratings pretty much provided, favorites that I own are probably Arctic Scavengers and Trieste at the moment. Catan also sees a fair amount of play since it's easiest to explain.


2. I'm VP of a college boardgame club so I usually have 20 people or so of varying skill levels available to play games once a week. My core group is about 4 people though.


3. Unplayed games are marked as such in comments on collection, Thunderstone might as well be unplayed though.


4. The club that I generally play with lasts about 3 hours, we like to be able to fit in a couple games though so generally looking for something around 90 minutes max. Core group could probably play something in the 90-120 minute range.


5. Probably D, looking at you Thunderstone. Not sure if we just don't get the rules or if we just don't enjoy it. I like other deck builders that I've played though.


6. I'm asking for myself


7. somewhere between 5 and 6, not a perfect cube so I can't do it in my head


8. No clue, I wanna say Carthage, but not sure if that was even part of the Roman Empire


9. No clue, my best guess would be soldiers are associated with cities and troops with nations


10. India was an English colony for a long time, wanna say 1800 something till at least WWI


11. Not sure in this context, I'd say action points


12. I generally try to gently clarify rules with folks if its really throwing the game off
Here goes:

> (1.) Where is your collection and your [rating] of each game in it you have played (these aren't all time, just "Right now" is fine)?



[Here](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Jyothi?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1) is my collection. The rating indicates (to me) how surely it'd survive a cull. I expect to be keeping 9+ (they count as 10 to me) and most probably 8+ games for instance. The decimal is to just have an idea of my current preferences.


> (2). When you play these games, how many people are present at your occasion?

Usually 3. Frequently just my SO and I. On occasion have friends over. This can be anything from a heavy gamer couple to 4 lighter gaming friends.


> (3). What games are unplayed in the collection?


Unranked games are unplayed (or only have less than a full round played). Of these, some are in transit to me (I convert 'preordered' to 'own' once shipped).  I'm putting off learning the pax games and polis for when I have a bit more free time.


> (4.) How long do you typically have to setup, play, then teardown a game?



A couple of hours. We play shorter games far more often but try to get a heavier game in each week. 



> (5.) Which of the following is painful to you to have bought? (not just budget, spending demeanor)



a> 5 games gone unplayed for years



> (6.) Is this question for you (therefore questions can be easily answered) or for another?

For me. I'm not really looking to buy many more games but would love a connoisseur's appraisal ;-)


> (7.) What is the cube root of 27?


3


> (8.) What is the name of the impregnable city that Rome moved its capitol to that didn't fall until cannons were used against it?


I wish I knew :-(


> (9.) What is the difference between a troop and a soldier?


A group (unit) of soldiers is a troop?



> (10.) Why do people in India speak English?


We were a British colony and there isn't any other common language



> (11.) What does AP mean?


Analysis Paralysis




> (12.) How do you get someone who's probably unintentionally cheating to stop doing the behavior that's giving them the advantage?



I hate holding grudges. If there's something to be said, I say it. But I try to do it politely :-)

Thanks for doing this! Always like getting peoples opinions and recommendations.

> (1.) Where is your collection and your [rating] of each game in it you have played (these aren't all time, just "Right now" is fine)?

[Here is my collection.](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/everyb0dy) I just put it up on BGG so there's a lot of incomplete info and ratings. I'll say this:

* Most played (no order): Cosmic Encounters, Inis, Carcassonne, Twilight Struggle, Archipelago, Mysterium/Dixit, Terra Mystica, ONAW/Daybreak

* My Favourites (no order): Terra Mystica, Avalon, Archipelago, Hive, Cosmic Encounters, ONAW/Daybreak, GO, Inis, SCHD, Twilight Struggle, Tales of Arabian Nights, Codenames, Mr. Jack in NY, Skull, Monikers

* My preferences: I like games with player interaction as playing with/against people is the best, rather than against a board game. I like deduction, but also strategy. Fine with complexity, but not with complexity for complexity's sake.

* Next planned purchases: Mythos Tales (MORE SCHD? Yes please!), Chinatown (lots of player interaction: "Step 2: Negotiate"), Mechs vs Minions(Seems fun and I want a miniatures game that's not too hardcore), interested in Scythe but not 100% sold on it.

* One day, I will get Twilight Imperium and make a damn weekend of it! Can't wait. But currently have no-one that's interested in even trying it out. :(

> (2). When you play these games, how many people are present at your occasion?

Usually 2-4. Frequently just my SO and I. On occasion have friends over. This can be anything from a heavy gamer couple to some lighter gaming friends. I'm trying to find more groups to play with at game stores and such.... but currently play about twice a week - once the SO and I, once in a group.


&nbsp;


> (3). What games are unplayed in the collection?

King of Tokyo. Basically, King of Tokyo. Also, the SO doesn't like extremely competitive games against me because I tend to excel at them (meaning Hive and GO see little play between us and I must get my fill of these two of my favourites elsewhere).


&nbsp;


> (4.) How long do you typically have to setup, play, then teardown a game?

A 2-4 hour time period usually. We try to mix it up; I'm generally the one that chooses the game if nothing's requested that week so I try to vary it up.


&nbsp;


> (5.) Which of the following is painful to you to have bought? (not just budget, spending demeanor)

 > a 5 games gone unplayed for years


&nbsp;


> (6.) Is this question for you (therefore questions can be easily answered) or for another?

For me.


&nbsp;


> (7.) What is the cube root of 27?

As Prince would say, "1 + 1 + 1 is 3"


&nbsp;


> (8.) What is the name of the impregnable city that Rome moved its capitol to that didn't fall until cannons were used against it?

Constantinople. (I copied others' answers here, though. I didn't actually know. But it sounds cool. I'm gonna read up on it.)


&nbsp;


> (9.) What is the difference between a troop and a soldier?

A soldier is to a crate of apples as a troop is to a truck of apple crates?


&nbsp;


> (10.) Why do people in India speak English?

Jolly ol' England went and gave them a silly sport and a silly language. And stole their tea. They should have had a tea party!


&nbsp;


> (11.) What does AP mean?

Action Provocation? Abhorrent Pittance? Alan Parsons Project? No that'd be AP^2 Let's go with Analysis Paralysis.


&nbsp;


> (12.) How do you get someone who's probably unintentionally cheating to stop doing the behavior that's giving them the advantage?

We're adults. "Hey, sorry, I may have explained the rules wrong. You can't do that this way. Here's how it works:....."

Point out what they are doing wrong and tell them to stop outright.
I play with an actual sommelier - he's not snooty at all. 

I haven't got a huge collection, but would love tailored suggestions! 

> 1. Where is your collection and your [rating] of each game in it you have played?

* Go: 7/10 Maybe doesn't count, but I love Go. Very hard to get others into it though, beyond a basic game. 

* Catan: 8/10 First love. Often first game on a sunday afternoon. strategic depth, a little salt, enough theme to be engaging, fun for newbies. 

* Caracassonne: 7/10. Less teaching time + setup which is better for newbies, but less depth. 

* Game Of Thrones: The Board Game (2nd edition): 7/10. Less balanced than other games, but nice depth. Last turn scramble always seems very mechanical and out of place though. 

* Betrayal at the house on the hill: 7/10. Fun game, lots of replayability, lots of theme. Some players hate being alone as the traitor though. Haunt Rules are often ambiguous which is a big negative for more strategy-focused group. 

* Zombies!!!: 4/10 I needed something to whip out when people are drinking/chatting/not paying attention, but still wanna play boardgames. easy to teach, but very little depth. Looks great and mowing through zombies or screwing each other over can be fun. In small dozes. 

* Love Letters: 6/10 Grand little game. Fun to play a few rounds, but doesn't have all that much depth. Usually played as we wait for people to arrive. 

* Coup: 6./10 enjoyable, bluffing element is nice but some groups hate it. Makes for a good interim game. 

* Exploding Kittens: 4/10 quite a shallow game, but bit of a 'Russian roulette' type tension can be good. 

* Pandemic: 5/10  have had some enjoyable games, and can see why some folks would really like it, but it seems to drag on too long, with lots of elements that don't amount to much depth. Lots of luck. The collaborative thing falls flat with some groups. 

* Back to the future Adventure Through Time: 5/10. More transparent of an optimization puzzle than most games.  More complex than deep on the surface, but we loved the theme and art and actually quite enjoyed it in the end. Doesn't get much play time though. 

* Fluxxx: 3/10 easy to explain and play with varying sizes of groups. can sometimes go on forever or end in an "oh? its over then" sort of way. Constantly changing goals makes it feel like each individual turn is a game in itself, with no chance of overarching strategy. 

* Tsuro: 6/10. A very 'nice' game. like the apperance, novelty and simplicity. Enjoyable for a 'once in a while' game. good length and complexity. feels like there's a lot of luck in it. 

* Cards against Humanity: 5/10 great party game, very flexible player numbers, don't even need a table, lots of laughs, limited re-playability. 

* Articulate: 6/10 Again, party game - very accessible and fast paced. makes for good laughs. Some folks hate the pacing. 

> 2. When you play these games, how many people are present at your occasion?

Group one: Sunday afternoon get-together with 4-6 players. Like competitive, strategy rich games, but time can be at a premium. 

Group two: Weeknight boardgame meetup. ~50 people in attendance. Tables vary in size from 3-10. often drinking is invovled and learning time/attention spans can be limited. 

> 3. What games are unplayed in the collection?

I've played them all at least once. Pandemic and Zombies!!! definitely see the least play-time. 

> 4. How long do you typically have to setup, play, then teardown a game?

Group one: We usually play one 'big' game (1-2 hours) and then a few smaller ones(15-30 mins) 

> 5. Which of the following is painful to you to have bought? (not just budget, spending demeanor)

wat? 

> 6. Is this question for you (answetherefore questions can be easily red) or for another?

for me and groups I play with. 

> 7. What is the cube root of 27?

3

> 8. What is the name of the impregnable city that Rome moved its capitol to that didn't fall until cannons were used against it?

Constantinople/istanbul? Technically it was breaking the temporary dam they'd set up, rather than the canons, that fucked 'em wasn't it? 

> 9. What is the difference between a troop and a soldier?

A comedy soldier is a lot less entertaining than a comedy troop. 

> 10. Why do people in India speak English?

Because colonialism. 

> 11. What does AP mean?

Attack points. Advanced placement. Accounts payable. 

> 12. How do you get someone who's probably unintentionally cheating to stop doing the behavior that's giving them the advantage?

alright....:

1. https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/clownfeet?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1

2. nearly always 3 (sometimes 2)

3. just The Colonists (because i haven't yet had a spare 21 hours to play it)

4. 4.5 hours

5. i literally have no idea what this question is asking....

6. For me

7. 3 (and two imaginary cube roots of 1 and 9)...but i'm guessing you meant 3....

8. not got a scooby do

9. i guess that a troop is a multiple of soldiers...?

10. Cause we colonised the shit out of them, nicked all their tea and gave them the greatest sport in the world.

11. Alan Partridge...AHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...you kind of remind me of him.

12. I wouldn't play with cheaters in the first place.
Interesting idea.  I haven't played with the board tiles outside of playing the game.

I'm curious if you all have house rules about tile placement.  When my friends and I play, our rule is that the drawn tile must be placed in a way that 'makes the most sense.'  So the room tile that is drawn has two doors, the doors must be connected to other rooms with open doors if possible.  You cannot just decide to aim the second door in a new direction to open a path away from discovered rooms.  

Anyone else have rules like that?  Or similar rules in other games, perhaps?
This reminds me of how nice it can feel sometimes to "doodle" with Carcassonne tiles.
I've often thought about this! I have come across perfect floors before but not an entire house; especially since a lot of tiles can be added to multiple floors. It'd be an interesting idea to play if you didn't explore but simply had a "perfect house" and drew a card each turn at random using a dice roll. rolling a 1 for an event, 2 for an item and a 0 for an omen on the betrayal dice. 
This actually happened to me on the first turn of my first game. You hit a lucky break, and the monster is simply discarded. It's in the rules reference somewhere, though I don't have mine handy right now so I can't point to the specific direction.

**Minor Spoilers!**

For those saying this can't happen or OP set something up wrong, that's not correct. This can come up in "The Gathering." While the investigators are holed up in the *Study* you could potentially draw either the *Flesh Eater* or *Icy Ghoul* card. These have a *Spawn* trigger for the *Attic* or *Cellar*, respectively. If the investigators haven't advanced the Act Deck yet, neither of these locations are in play and the monster technically can't spawn. As far as I'm aware this is the only spot in the core set campaign where this can come up however.
If the location isn't in play then it is discarded. See page 19 of the rules reference.
Simply discard the monster. 
Which monster did this happen with? We've played through all three scenarios at least once and not come across this possibility so far.
Did you, maybe, shuffle a card into the deck that was meant to be set aside? I've not encountered this situation, and I would imagine the game was extensively play tested to avoid this sort of thing happening.
You might have a wrong card in the deck. Double check the symbols. I did the exact same thing.
This is for the narrative adventure/storytelling elements rather than the mechanics, but Tales of the Arabian Nights is close to record low prices on Amazon - currently at $37.50.  If you sometimes have four or less people in your group, I recommend it.
Mice and Mystics has a really fun coop feel, being a tactical mini's game with a small board and a few baddies to thwart, and a wonderfully dark & warm theme.
Pandemic legacy.
**T.I.M.E Stories** does this very well 
**Cthulhu's Vault** comes to mind. You all have cards with people, places and things on them that you play to the center of the table for points (and you have to explain how they fit into the ongoing narrative). Each card you play earns you power to resurrect your specific Elder God. The game starts out cooperative until one of you raises your old one, and then everyone has to try to take you down. Our group enjoyed it. 
Is it okay that I'm most excited for Batman Zombie Dice? That's okay, right? 


But a Munchkin CCG. Christ...
There does seem to be a sort of "you idiots will buy anything" quality to the decision to design and market a Munchkin CCG.
I didn't see any negative vibes from playtesters. Sounds like they found a bunch of people that would love the game to do their playtesting. 
8 games in, first place has done nothing but explore and 2nd place has done a little of everything, but mostly colonies. I would posit the opposite, that exploration is incredibly overpowered, and that anyone who feels otherwise is incredibly bad at the game.


Alot of your points are flawed as well:

If it is so easy to sail out and buy good, and then sail them home and build, then why were you SO far away from getting a colony your first game? You said you weren't even close, but if that is the easiest action then I don't follow. It's not the exact same as building a cheap building, but it's essentially equivalent to building 6 of them, and according to you that should have been a breeze.

Not to mention your chart on glory completely ignores how exploration and raiding is awarded, and the actions required to do them. Exploring literally takes one action, and you get 1 glory PLUS any rewards; that can range from a good to 4 VP+2 goods in burial sites. The higher the site, the higher the reward (so they aren't stagnant at all). Exploring at sea adds the points for the location. So it's not "1 VP" to explore; it never is even at the worst locations.

Building a building requires buying the goods, sailing home, building at discount, which is 2 revolving actions. It is sure fire points, but it takes more time to continually do that and all the while you are spending all your money so you can't buy sure fire points in treasure. Say you spend 6 on goods turn 1. you sail home and build for 2 coins. Next turn you build and upgrade for 4 coins. That is all your money, so you have to sail and tax, then buy and sail home. You are now at turn 5 with still 3 glory and only 1 good to your name. 

If I raid a sail spot at 5 defense, I get the Glory, I get a yellow sail and I get a glory for that yellow sail. So that is 2 VP and a nice +1 to explore just off of one action.

It's one thing to say the game is bad; that is probably agreed by most people. It's another to say the game is randomly swingy; that is probably true because the reward range on exploration is absurd. But to say a game is broken, and then not give all the rules and to really contradict your own points is asinine.
**applauds**

It's exactly this type of emotion a designer should try to prevent. I wonder what the playtesters did? Plaid Hat is known for quality playtesting, so was the awe of 'next legacy game' blinding everybody or no one dared to say anything? 
I would say that this game has delivered me the single worst gaming session that I've ever had; and it took around 3 hours for it to end.

I detailed it [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1676954/couple-gamplay-issues-ive-had-spoilers-regarding-v), but the actual description of the events are a bit spoiler-y.  Nevertheless, I think I've identified the main issues that really dragged things down for me.

*  Huge swings in glory that couldn't really be planned for ahead of time (two people being awarded ~8-9 Glory out of 15 on turn 2)
* Mid-game rule changes or milestones that could not be planned for and are claimed by whomever is closest to the random event.  Coupled with the above, it can be game changing
* Again, due to the previous two points; the fact that the game can end swiftly without warning and you don't necessarily have a closing turn to finish whatever you can means that many games end with one or two people having a boat load of resources that they can't do anything with.  They probably wasted half the game collecting them only for a new glory source to change the nature of the current game.
* Due to the suddenness of game end, early campaign leads seem to be more about random sampling of timing rather than overall better play.
* Finally, let's say you've had good fortune in the first few games; the catch-up mechanic is going to kick your ass eventually.  You will have to sit at the table knowing that there's very little chance winning so you should focus on minor tasks.  However, because the game can be so swingy; even your minor task may not be accomplishable. It makes sense that the tables need to be balanced somehow but it can lead to games which are not very enjoyable to play.
* On top of this, the take-that mechanics rightfully have people targeting the campaign leader.  The person who may already be having a crappier game due to catch-up mechanics.  That makes for a miserable session that you are just sitting through.

I enjoy some of the mechanics, but I think some of the other mechanics detract from what could have been a better game.  It could be that some tweaks to game end conditions and/or a few other issues may have really helped.  I think a Suburbia-type endgame would help and I wish there was a better way to value certain events or achievements without literally waiting until they happen.
If the goal of the game is to collect glory, why are you not following a strategy that nets you the most glory within the span of the game?
10 Gold treasure = 1 Glory
22 Gold treasure = 1 Glory

Uh --- 22 gold treasures are 2 glory.
Yeah, one player was really upset one game where I ended the game one turn before he could found the 1st colony. Sorry buddy, all that work was for nothing, now dump all those goods into the sea. Of course, two games later he made an alliance with another player to sink my two ships about to found a colony, pretty much invalidating my whole game. FUN!
It sounds like you've only opened the first two boxes, and I think you may have a skewed impression of what the dominant strategy is in SeaFall, due to the second box's heavy emphasis on mercantile activities.

Regarding the first game, you're omitting the fact that there is a milestone for building three structures, so the winning player obviously was going after that.  Even with the milestone, that would have only netted him 7 of the required 11 glory, so he had to have done things other than just build structures.  Sounds like he used the Renowned Builder for additional glory, but he still had to have raided, or built upgrades, or explored at some point.  For what it's worth, this is the same strategy I employed in my first game of SeaFall and won.  It's generally a good thing to do stuff that gets you milestones.

Regarding the milestone for getting three colonies, it isn't just worth 3 glory.  You get a permanent upgrade to your province, you get the 9 glory for building the colonies, you get 1 glory for each colony you activate in that game and all future games, and you get the associated bonuses for the active colonies.  I only have one colony in my game, but it's the one that gives me +1 success to all explore endeavors within 4 spaces, which has been a huge help for exploration.  Assuming I activate it every game and our campaign lasts 15 games, it will net me a total of 16 glory over the course of the campaign, which is pretty good.

You're ignoring a number of things about points you get for endeavors/actions.  Exploring higher-difficulty sites typically gives you additional rewards, including bonus glory.  It's typical to get 4-6 glory for exploration endeavors later in the game.  Raiding higher-difficulty sites gives you better rewards.  You get 2 glory for raiding docks because of the free ship upgrade.  There are structures and upgrades that are worth additional glory later in the campaign, and more expensive structures/upgrades typically give you better benefits. 
My group is still loving it, and this is not our experience with this game at all. We have no problem separating mechanics vs. game story for this game.

As for having 12 gold starting in the next game, in our experience, that means you do a Builder Action to buy an upgrade and sail away and/or sail and then purchase goods. You get a significant leg up on purchase power. You also have starting enmity which can give you an advantage to raid someone's vault, for a better gold advantage, or go ahead and try to grab their adviser. 

OP - Perhaps this can be your "Come to Jesus" moment and realize it's just not a game for you? I'd talk to your group about the un-fun you're having, and gracefully exit so they can enjoy it. I feel like this would get me down to hear this is the experience another in my group was having, and I'd rather not waste their time. 
A few thoughts, from 5 games in and 4 boxes open (Spoilers up to box 2).  This is coming from a perspective of someone very much enjoying the game.

-It sounds like your game doesn't have a lot of PvP raiding.  Stealing other peoples OP advisors and sinking their ships full of upgrades is baked into the game as a balancing factor.  If you take a mercantilist strategy, either you commit resources to defending against raids or you leave yourself open.  Enmity means one player doesn't get too hosed in a single game, but probably won't be able to win game after game with the same strategy, especially if people actively disrupt them.

-Colonies are nowhere as weak as you indicate.  You get 4 glory the game you found it, and an additional 1 glory in EVERY future game you activate it, plus your specific colony perk. Yes, founding them is tough, and you might get unlucky and have the game end before you get one, but the catch up mechanic seems almost tailor made for building colonies faster than opponents.  In my game, there are two players who have set big chunks of their strategy around specific colony perks, so they definitely have value.

-I would disagree with your dominant strategy assessment regarding buildings.  That's not to say there isn't one: the dominant strategy is getting milestones, for the massive glory boost and the permanent upgrade.  But the likelihood of any one player getting all the milestones is absurdly low, and the milestones actually encourage varying your strategy game to game over the course of the campaign.  And while difficult, you can win without them, or at the very least put yourself in a better position for the next game.  There was one game where I was unlikely to win, but the other players were racing for a time-consuming milestone.  I used that game to grab my first colony and load up on research cards to boost my future explore actions.

-Won't get too specific, but later in the campaign exploration gets REALLY good.  Maybe that 10 explore site might be worth more than just 1 glory.  I will say that having that reward hidden is not my favorite choice for the game design; feels really good for the person exploring, but it comes out of nowhere and makes everyone else suddenly reevaluate their strategy mid game.

All that being said, it seems like you're not having a grand time with the game.  If you want to keep playing, I'd recommend a thorough rereading of the rules, as your post indicates some substantial misunderstandings.  Also know that exploration does become more valuable.  Hopefully your experience turns around, or you find another Legacy game in the future you enjoy more thoroughly.
The more I read about this game, the more secure I feel that I made the right decision: We pre-ordered the game, but after reviews decided we wouldn't like it, so we sold it unopened and kept the metal coins. Technically we took a $15 loss, but that translates into paying $15 for an awesome set of metal coins that now reside in our copy of **Terra Mystica**. :)
Your points are garbage.  I'm on a tablet so I can't go through em all.  The most points you can get from buildings and upgrades is 7 on your province board, so they are getting points another way.  And making 3 colonies nets you 12 points before considering the milestone.  Why would you take the more expensive upgrades/buildings.  Because they are better, screw the glory, later games you need that extra raid and explore.  Building a colony is 4 points, how the hell is that the same as the 1 glory you get making a building in your province.  Also the rewards for exploring higher level areas is that they give better rewards.  Also provinces can be raided like 6 times a year, just the same area can't be raided.  How can people complain so much when they don't know how to play the damn game.
[This](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1677248/seafall-review-no-spoilers-7-games-4-players) review expresses what I've been thinking about the game for a little while now. It's not broken, at all.
I've been winning most of the games, and I do a lot of different things. There's a lot of incremental glory you can pick up along the way (like raiding for a resource you need instead of trading) and I usually focus on milestones which require you to do different things, and dictate my upgrade paths for the next game. 

But for example I'll get glory from raiding for resources, glory for the upgrade I buy to do exploring, then get points for exploring a new island. Then complete a milestone and buy a treasure for the last couple of points. 

All my games I felt like I've really gotten a lot of points spread out over doing different things. 

Sorry you're not having fun, but you can't declare a game mechanically broken because you've played four games of it and didn't like it. You seem to totally discount that you may not be doing things in the optimal way, rather than just what you think is the optimal way, and on top of that it seems you've gotten a couple of rules wrong. 

I don't know, I don't get it. I have no interest in an Internet argument and I'm not even trying to change your mind here, just find it strange when people feel compelled to make broad sweeping objective statements based on their own subjective experience. If you don't like it, move on. Me and my group are having a blast with it. 
Interesting that you guys dig **Pandemic** as much as you do, considering the ability to extrapolate possible moves between 4p for turns and turns into the future to achieve maximum benefit.

I'd humbly submit **Lord of Waterdeep** to be checked out. It's a worker placement game with tons of love and accolades on this sub and in the market. It has a fantasy/DnD theme and a very manageable rules weight. It is also fantastic at 4p and still pretty solid at 2p.
**Viticulture: EE** - Great worker placement game about making wine. 

**Coloretto** - Simple set collecting game with some interesting twists with the scoring.

**Quadropolis** - Quick city building game. It plays in about an hour. 

Two player games **Patchwork** and **Targi** are both great.

**Kemet** Quick paced dudes on a map game. Maybe some AP around upgrade selection but otherwise should be pretty smooth sailing. 
I think **Viticulture Essential Edition** and **New Bedford** are good options for worker-placement that don't seem to trigger much AP in my experience. I would also recommend **Eight-Minute Empire: Legends** for a great, quick area control game. **Abyss** is enjoyed by everyone I've played it with, though I can't comment on how good the 2-player game is. Another co-op that you might want to look at is **Black Orchestra**. My copy hasn't arrived yet, but I've got it on order, and I'm looking forward to plotting to assassinate Hitler.

Lots of games are designed for two players, like **Patchwork** , **Star Realms**, or **Hive**.

**Splendor**, **Red7**, **Hanabi**, **Pandemic**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**, **Paperback**, **Valley of the Kings**, and **Gloom** (if you and your husband are a little creative) are all fun 2 player. Plus, my boyfriend and I like to mix and match Carcassonne expansions - we have about 10 and usually pick two at random to mix in and keep it interesting.


The list can get quite lengthy! We play almost exclusively as just the two of us, so we have a lot of experience with what works and what doesn't.

Among my Two-Player Specific games:

* Odin's Ravens
* Star Realms (but if you don't like Dominion you may not dig it)
* 7 Wonders Duel
* Targi
* Patchwork
* Netrunner (another deck builder, though, so maybe not for you?)
* Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small (out of print again, I think)
* Jaipur


Of other 2+ games:

* Isle of Skye (since you like Carcassonne, this is high on my recommendation list)
* Burgle Bros
* Orleans
* San Juan
* Run, Fight, or Die
* Roll for the Galaxy
* Star Trek Panic
* Castles of Burgundy
* Pandemic (everything)
* Zombicide
* Shadowrun: Crossfire
* Escape: The Curse of the Temple
* The Game (very light)
* Catan Dice (also very light)
* Elder Sign
* Lanterns
* Lords of Waterdeep

*Warning: Rivals for Catan is a VERY different game than Settlers of Catan. If you love Catan, I just want you to go in with proper expectations.*
7 Wonders Duel and Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective are two gems. 
Oh also Paperback!
*Castles of Burgundy* plays very well at 2 players. All that being said, I really like *Agricola* at two, too. *Lords of Waterdeep* plays best with more players but is still great fun at 2P. 
Check out **Rivals for Catan**.  It is a two-player, card version of Catan.  It plays differently than regular Catan, but should still give you that familiar vibe.

**Tash-Kalar** is another great two-player game that I need to throw out there, since it is my personal favorite for one-on-one play.

What is it you don't like about **Dominion**?  Perhaps there is a different deck-builder that may appeal to both of you?


We play pretty much exclusively 2P. Favourites are: 

* Galaxy Trucker

* Forbidden Stars

* Arkham Horror Card Game/Eldritch Horror/Arkham Horror

* Dead of Winter

* Letters from Whitechapel

* Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective

* Pandemic

* Star Realms

* Flash Point

* Hanabi

* Merchants & Marauders

* Descent
95% of my collection is dedicated to 2 player gaming, with ratings based largely on that experience: [Link](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/FightOnGoBlue?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1)
7 wonders duels is real godlike 
Jaipur, Dreamwell, Biblios. My husband and I play these three all the time.
**7 Wonders Duel**, **Evolution The Beginning**, and **The Ravens of Thri Sahashri** are big hits for my wife and I.
We like **Seasons** and **Sentinels of the Multiverse.**
Terraforming Mars.
Chess! 

Might sound like a smart ass answer, but it really is the original. And you it's not a real home until there's a chessboard lying around somewhere. 
Tummysticks. 
Twilight Struggle, Keyflower (with the Merchants), Ophir, Urban Sprawl, Akrotiri, and 7 wonders duel
The difficulty definitely ramps up, but the main thing to remember is that the game itself is changing. The most avid and competent **Pandemic** player in our group was actually the one most prone to mistakes because he kept trying to get us to strategize and play the game like it was vanilla **Pandemic**. Once you hit April, that really doesn't fly any more. Honestly, my group's biggest losses in **Pandemic Legacy** came from us not quickly tweaking our strategy enough in response to the continuous changes in the game because we were accustomed to regular **Pandemic**. 

Also, you need to remember that the goal is to win the campaign, not each individual game. We made a lot of decisions that were strategic in terms of the current game or the very next game we were going to play, but not so much in terms of the entire campaign still in front of us. Sometimes you have to give up a battle in order to take the time and set yourself up better for the rest of the campaign.
Might want to reread the rues to make sure you're playing correctly.
Something that I think helps a lot is knowing that you set up the board THEN select your people. This really helps in preventing to many outbreaks and allows more strategy.
My group is only at June so I can't give help further along but I think we've lost 3 times. I wouldn't say it's the easiest game out there, but I do feel like every game we're going to win even if it gets scary. Most of our losses end up because we run out of player cards so the game just ends and as soon as I realize that I can see how we could have won with just 2-4 more turns so we were on the right path but just needed to be faster.

Since we can't get too specific, can you identify what is causing your losses? 
Too many pandemics? 
Running out of player cards (like my group)?
Utilizing starter research stations to start at or move to the biggest problem areas?
Using the same characters or different characters each time? 
Is your medic the hero of the game or are you relying on other characters to pull the most weight?
We made a couple small rule mistakes that made the game too easy, and then we *thought* we fixed it, which made the game *impossibly hard*! Make sure you're doing this right:

Spoiler for June: [Spoiler](/s "We totally forgot for a few games that you are supposed to add a faded figure each time you draw a faded city card from the Player Deck, so we found that we had a few easy games in a row. I double checked the rules, and realised we missed it, so then we started adding the faded figures when we drew from that deck. *However*, you ONLY add a figure if the card you draw from the player deck is from a city in the original colour of the faded, you *do not* add a figure if it's a city that has become faded because the faded have spread out of their region. Once we discovered this, we realised why the game was impossibly hard, and now are back on track. In a sense, replacing a rule that made the game temporarily too easy for one that made it temporarily too difficult probably evened it out for us.")
Third lost in June and already disheartened? Losing and the game is too hard? Why play a game where you can always win?

I run two boxes of Pandemic. Red group is elite players. Blue group is above average hardcore.

Blue lost first three games but the board is a lot better than Red in November. 

Red won many games until the funding was zero. But the board looks worst than blue. 

The dynamic difficulty is great. It's not too hard, Nor too easy. It scales well and is our Legacy Favourite. Better than Seafall. 

Just enjoy the ride. Don't get demoralised. Sometimes it's just the card draw. 
We lost three straight games in March/April and then again in November/December.  I wouldn't say it's 'hard', but sometimes you just get unlucky with your card draws.  Relax and enjoy the story.  :)
My group also lost three in a row around that time before turning it around. Some of our losses were just really bad luck, others were us getting too cocky. 
Things to remember, always have at least one person on cure duty. 

When given the new objective types (non standard pandemic stuff) make sure to utilize the new characters whom are designed to tackle those issues. The new problems the game introduces will be extremely hard to tackle without them. COdA is no joke. 


Always aim to eradicate a disease that has low cubes in the early game if possible. Those end of game upgrades for diseases make tackling that issue easier and easier. 


Use some of the special characters abilities to prevent outbreaks when possible. The game require a lot more tactical for thought and planning. As others have said don't be afraid to lose a game but leave the board not in shambles. 

Common issues:whenever a character is played for the first time make sure they get a relationship sticker. Always upgrade characters whom don't have scars.

Final tip: since you shuffle the outbreak cards don't be afraid to add a few more cards to the early game piles and less to the later game ones. It can give you an easier early game which can secure certain months. 

We had a lot of struggles with surprise epidemics and running out of the player deck. Then we started tracking the infection deck. One player has a sheet that lists every infection card we have seen and after the first epidemic we add check marks as the cities come back. 
****SPOILERS****
It all depends on your choices between games. Here is what made PL very easy:

- choose rivals relationship upgrade to pick up discarded cards
- use quarantine lady and medic (always quarantine trouble spots)
- make research station permanent (later military stations too)
- make roadblocks around THAT area permanent to stop the spread
- get Pilot skill upgrade
- EDIT: also forgot to add to make diseases easier to cure whenever you cant do the above points.  

Sorry. I am writing it from my phone so I am not sure how to cover spoilers. I hope i am not spoiling too much from the story. 
I think based on what I've read on others games it depends a lot on what color becomes COdA and how many positive mutations you have on the others.  For our game we were very luck and always tried to eradicate when we could so we could get the mutations.  Once we got to the point were we didn't need to spend actions or be at a station to make the cure made things a lot easier by being able to cure in the field while handling other objectives.

And as others mentioned it helps that if you know that you are not going to be able to pull off a win, look for ways that you can set yourself up better for the next game.  Having troubles getting around to deal with areas, try to build a few structures to be come permanent.  ect

Also don't be afraid to look for creative ways to make use of relationships or perks.  Our team actually got a last turn win by making use of the rival perk after having to discard due to hand size and the two rivals being able to discard colors the other needed to get last 2 cures needed.
My girlfriend and I played through the whole campaign and it was pretty easy, but its worth noting that Pandemic is always harder with more players. 
Yeah, Pandemic Legacy was very difficult for our group as well. I think a lot of players have player Pandemic to death, and they'll obviously find the game a lot easier.

Look at it this way - one more loss and you open the secret box!
So, my playgroup struggled early on in the game, in part because we were stubborn and slow to use the new "technologies" added as the months went on. Something new would be added to the game, and we'd say, "Huh, interesting," and play the next game without it and wonder why things were so challenging.

If you're losing due to too many outbreaks, then that tells me you may not be attending to the cities that are ready to pop, and you may not be using the outbreak-controlling technologies and characters the game has thrown your way. I'd recommend looking at your role selections. You could likely use one or two more characters each game who will either contain and treat disease or facilitate easier movement to hotspots. This is arguably more valuable than in base Pandemic, because the Panic Level mechanic means that outbreaks don't just bring you closer to game over, they also make your board that much harder to navigate.

You're seasoned Pandemic players, so I assume you have the rules down pat, but it probably wouldn't hurt to reread the manual to make sure you're not missing anything or making it harder for yourselves. Just in case.
My group did our first couple swings at it yesterday.  We got trounced in early January.  Like, lost within 20 minutes(second epidemic card finished us due to the chain reaction outbreaks)

Popped in for late January and won, but it was closeX. We never eradicated a single disease
This may help? https://youtu.be/y9K46iF-Ees
Its a movement programming game with variable player powers similar to colt express but with a capture the flag theme.  The characters you move around the board actually hold flags so you can steal other player flags and set up traps and things like that.  It's pretty cool - you should check it out!
Forbidden Desert, two player. It was extremely tense, we had to play every move perfectly, especially grabbing water and hiding from the sun at the right time. We high-fived at the end (we English people don't do that a lot)
Not eldritch horror
**Friday**
Best I've ever done was Ghost Stories on Normal. Some day we'll revisit it and try for Nightmare.
Pandemic with 7 epidemics from On The Brink. And 6 epidemics a few times, probably a 50% win rate.

It genuinely requires a lucky draw to begin; there's no substitute for not having a turn-1 or 2 epidemic. But then, you have to control the board and smash out those cures. I recommend removing 2 cubes from a 3-cube city whenever possible; one would only be a temporary fix, but 3 is usually a waste of actions that are needed elsewhere.

And I'm very much not in the camp that believes Pandemic is "only" an optimization puzzle; if you've got a couple of interesting event cards among the team, you can perform some absolute miracles.

For the record, my group hit 4 losses in a row in P:Legacy, but no-one ever talks about those! Just worth remembering that if you're feeling dispirited when others say how easy it is.
Ghost stories. Been ages though so can't really elaborate I'm  afraid
**Friday** once, still haven't beaten it again.
Rise of Augustus


Each person is trying to fulfill their own objective cards by matching symbols, and the symbols are drawn out of a bag and called out to the group.
**Dingo's Dreams** is a cool take on Bingo combined with a slide puzzle.
I like **Take It Easy**, which long predates Karuba. It's all about trying to build different lines of color to score points. There are several different play modes and there are some other games in the series that I have not played. Take It Easy is a nice chill puzzle game.
**Cities**, which has been redesigned as **Limes**, is terrific.
**Galaxy Trucker** is fabulous. Race to build a space ship out of limited parts, then fly cargo across space, encountering obstacles along the way. 

**Dead of Winter** is co-op to survive, but everyone has their own secret objective - and there may also be a betrayer.

**Forbidden Stars** is pretty much capture the flag in space. Super fun longer game
For a fiend, I would definitely get Brennan.  He's fiendish.
One expansion is tricky. 
The expansion contains all the cards for a deck. That's playable, but can't build decks. And it has no dice, so he will need yours

Additionally, all the expansion decks use all ten dice of a single color, so whichever color he's using, you can't use at all

Of the standalone expansion decks, I do like Frostdale Giants
Rin if he prefers a board-based attacking style, Brennen if he prefers a control/burn style, Leo if he prefers being hard to hit, Victoria if he prefers to mess with peoples' dice. While there are cards to suit all styles in these decks, those are the general themes in my view. 

On balance, I'd say that Brennen's deck has the "best" cards on average (Regress, Blood Chains, Fire Archer, Choke - all have good general utility), although Rin's deck includes Frostback Bear, which is more or less a cornerstone unit of any deck using nature dice at this point.
Without knowing anything, I would recommend Rin, but it would be helpful to know his play style and preferences.
[L'Imaginaire](http://www.imaginaire.com/indexv2.jsp?langue=en) in Quebec City has not been mentionned yet. They offer free shipping Canada-wide for 50$+ orders. Just make sure you choose the English versions if French is not your thing ;)
BoardGameBliss, primarily. I like that they have a rewards system and are pretty responsive and accommodating. For example, I had some games on hold, including one for an out-of-town co-worker. Said co-worker then placed an order of her own for some Broken Token stuff, and I sent an email asking they ship the game I paid for in that order, and they did it. My co-worker was super confused when the game showed up, but her and her husband were very happy and quite impressed that they'd be willing to do that. And that's just one of several little positive things I could say about BGB.

Quiche Games is also really good, and they'll usually price-match, but their stock seems low comparatively. They also bumped their free shipping threshold up from $100 to $150, putting the margin of advantage over BGB and others that much lower. I also like Meeplemart and sometimes Great Boardgames, and I've ordered from Wood For Sheep and Starlit Citadel before.

I have ordered from Amazon too, but not very much... Their prices are much higher than they ought to be, for such a big company. But they have an advantage, in that there is a really good return policy for virtually everything (within reason, anyhow).

You can check at BoardGamePrices.com (scroll down the Canadian flags) to compare prices and stock between retailers, too. They don't list everyone all the time, though, so it pays to compare manually with the ones not listed.
All of the below options have cheap shipping, within a dollar of each other.

**boardgamebliss.com** is really the go-to spot for me.  Excellent customer service and great selection.  Only down side is they offer really competitive shipping to the US so any in-demand games go just that much faster. Great for the store, bad for my chances of getting a hot new title.

**401games** is great with the selections and easy to navigate website. Lots of good pre-orders available and shipping is fast.  Downside is customer service, if you have a problem with your shipment, you just may be SOOL.  Read the fine print in their shipping/return policy.  They take really good care of shipping their packages though so its usually not a problem.  Only had one incident and the game company took care of it anyway.  Ordered since several times without problem.  

**Meeplemart** may have the best hidden sales in Canada, but their website is difficult to manage.  Still always worth keeping an eye on their sales page every so often.  I got Merchants of Venus NIS a while ago for $25, and  Robinson Crusoe: Voyage of the Beagle for $15, and they have had other crazy sales since.  It never seems to be advertised though

**Quiche** has a veery nice website, but selections and volume is pretty lacking.  They also seem to be pretty slow at bringing in new titles.  Still, their prices are competitive so its worth keeping an eye on them.

**Greatboardgames** website is dated, but they have a very good selection and competitive prices.  I have had good luck finding games that are sold out everywhere else here.  They may have the best warehouse in Canada next to boardgamebliss, but they are often over looked so you can easily strike gold here.


Also, do not be so quick to dismiss Amazon.ca.  They have some of the best deals in Canada,, but they are rare and never advertised.  At this time of the year, they will quietly start releasing some hot titles on there "deal of the day" section  starting sometime soon, so start checking in on it every morning.  I got Armada and Imperial Assualt for $60 each last year.


I have found lots of online stores that are local to me that have very good prices.  Depending on where you live, you may have a few too, and then you can save on shipping.

best of luck.
Quichegames, awesome customer service!
I enjoy greatboardgames.ca they've always done well by me and seem to have good selection and prices. 
Greatboardgames.ca, boardgamebliss and most recently apttogame
If you're in London area, Jason does free delivery for Geekstop Games. Otherwise, whatever is the best listed on boardgameprices.com
The only one I've used that I haven't seen mentioned yet is hitgames.ca

The vast majority I buy from 401 games though. They're pretty consistently the cheapest for most things so usually I buy from other places only if they don't have what I want. 
I use a variety of shops in the GTA and even if I buy online I mostly arrange pick-ups. 

* **Boardgamebliss** : I live less than a 15 min drive away so I can shop online then pick up orders. I do most of my game purchases through them. Great service
* **Amazon.ca** : only use the big guy when they have steep discounts or deals of the day.

It can depend on where you are but in general I would say that www.boardgamebliss.com has been my goto online store for their selection, imports, pricing, responsiveness and quick shipping.

Having said that:

http://www.greatboardgames.ca/ <- I live in the Kitchener\Waterloo region and these guys offer free pickup most Saturdays now so I have started ordering here when they have what I want.

http://www.boardgameshelf.com/ <- I have family in Burlington and these guys have some great deals\sales and offer flexible pickup.  
I really like [boardgamebliss.com] (http://boardgamebliss.com) and think they have great customer service, so I try to order from there as much as possible.

When Boardgamebliss doesn't have what I need in stock, [401 Games] (http://401games.com).

Or Amazon.com when I have to. Like you said, sometimes it ends up being cheaper than Amazon.ca, even with the conversion and shipping.
I'm just going to mention a couple not already mentioned by /u/shineuponthee.

* **401games.ca** is a Toronto store has good prices and a decent selection. Selection isn't usually quite as good as BoardGameBliss, but for the things they do have you'll often find that their prices are better (although sometimes the price is worse too - it's definitely worth shopping around!). 401games also has a better free shipping threshold than BoardGameBliss
* **Apt to Game** (apttogame.com) is a newer company from rural Alberta (soon moving to Edmonton). Their selection isn't as good as 401games or BoardGameBliss, but they're slowly improving and have similar pricing. Their shipping threshold is also lower, at just $100, so it's worth checking their website out too.
This was asked not too long ago and while I haven't ordered anything yet from this site, they have comparable prices, free shipping regardless of box and some pretty bad ass lists.

snakesandlattes.com[snakesandlattes.com](http://www.snakesandlattes.com/)
Tips? Aside from boardgameprices, there isn't much else to do. Sales are pretty infrequent. There is the odd ding and dent deal, if that is what you want.

I also use Levalet and Geekstopgames as well in addition to those listed.
401Games. I live a 5 minute walk from them. So I usually go there.

Otherwise, Amazon.ca when then have deals. But, really, with shipping, it works out to just be better for me to pick up from a store. 
amazon does have good deals, if the game is in stock.  If you're buying something that only has 2 copies left and they are marking it up, then it's going to be over retail.  I always check before buying.

I've bought from quiche or 401games.
boardgamebliss.com

401games.com

meeplemart.com

quichegames.com

greatboardgames.com

htnorth.com

It depends on where you're shipping to.  These stores are based all over the country.  Shipping will be less if you can ship local.
My order of preference:

**Greatboardgames.ca**

I have been shopping there for years, anyone remember when they were called german games. Usually a few bucks cheaper than the others.

**Boardgamebliss**

Placed my first order with them on Monday and it shipped Tuesday. Tried them because they had Cottage Garden and Great Boardgames didn't. The points thing is neat. I like that certain games will qualify you for free shipping.

**401 Games**

Nice selection but haven't bought from them personally but many in my group have.
I'm south of Vancouver, 16km North of the US border. US mailbox services in Blaine, WA are a big thing here. They'll process and hold packages for you for $2US each. Add in a Nexus card, and even with the exchange rate cross border shopping can have some good deals. 
I have used boardgamebliss and starlit citadel.

Also check out boardgameprices.com Canadian sites are lower down the result page.
Boardgames.ca
When I started buying I used amazon, having found BoardGameBliss and 401games I regret the extra money wasted.
I used to use boardgamebliss because they allow you to hold orders until everything you want to buy comes in. Their communication is very good as well. But don't be duped by their reward system: it sounds good, but the fact of the matter is that - even if you max out the points-for-cash-discount - it only works out to a 5% discount. If you can find games for better prices on other sites, you should buy lower prices, and not eventual small discount.

I've had some problems with Boardgamebliss recently, and I find it more trouble than it's worth to send emails back and forth 7 times for a $5 ding-and-dent discount.

I've switched to 401games.ca for their free shipping at $150 and fairly good selection. It's not perfect though: they don't officially allow you to hold orders, and their selection is generally good, but bliss seems to have everything (e.g. BIOS Genesis never came in at 401; Dale of Merchants never came in). But if you are looking for all large-publisher releases, 401games is great because you can make smaller orders for free shipping, and seem to be same price or $1-$8 cheaper than Bliss (Five Trives, for example, is quite a bit cheaper, which is better than 5% in many cases!) 401games has also gone above and beyond when it comes to fixing problems. No long back and forth: they are direct and offer to fix the problem. They have won my loyalty the last couple months.

Greatboardgames is a place i\ ordered from once, but they screwed up the order (out of stock on an item I ordered and needed for a gift) and wouldn't communicate except with a "sorry". A little frustrating, and I haven't used them since.


I'm in "technically Canada", Quebec. Well, Montreal, so I'm lucky there are good FLGS around.
I've ordered from http://www.levalet.com/en/ and http://www.randolph.ca/boutique/ I've had very good experience with both, great service and decent prices.
I've used BoardGameBliss and Amazon. Had great experiences with both.

This thread has a ton of other sites that I will definitely check out.

Always shop around :) but it's always worth going to your LGS and asking if they will match an online price (price+ shipping) it never hurts to ask and it's always better to shop local and support your tabletop community.

Here is a list of board games with "action / movement programming".

[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2689/action-movement-programming](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2689/action-movement-programming)

While not exactly what you would look for, these are all games in which a player learns setting up actions and executing them.
It might be more help if you could give a brief example of each "principal" that you want to teach, and how it would work in the real world, and then some people would help throw out some game mechanics / ideas that fit that principal. I think trying to start with games that we like which might fit your principals is the wrong way to do this.

Its been a while since my SWEngineering class, and all I really remember is how to draw pretty diagrams with Visio. 

Also, Its totally fine to have some fun and learn about board games, thats awesome its a really cool hobby that will probably appeal to a lot of things you like as a comp sci major, but dont lose focus of the assignment here. I highly doubt your prof is looking for an actually fun to play / real world board game, its just a more casual way to display some concepts. For instance you wont lose points for the game being lame. You will lose points for barely touching on the principals s/he wants to highlight or being super duper abstract and distant about what the principals are. 

Wow , if I have 4 nights a week to game I'd be super happy!
"Friday" isn't bad!

Im kind of in your situation as well and have turned to trying out Solo games. But I do so with the help of Tabletop Simulator. I would gather a list of solo games or games that are good to solo and download the mod, if available, for TTS and give them a try. Many I've played once or twice and found I didn't enjoy them enough. Others were great and I decided to buy them. Maybe this could work for you.


Some games I've solo'ed and liked have been


**Leaving Earth** Run your own Space Program and send rockets into space achieving various mission objectives. As a space guy. I freakin love this game.


**onirim** It was okay. Very light, not too challenging for the base game. But with the expansions it gets difficult very quickly. 


**Pandemic** Surprisingly good as a solo game.

**Arkham Horror The Card Game** Very cool, but I personally would enjoy it will others. Jut still very fun and functional.

**Friday** Once you "solve" the strategy to beat it. You may get over this one. I have owned it for a year or so now and play it casually and I've yet to "solve" it. I still have fun with it.






It really depends what you are in to with games. You should look into the Oniverse games (onirim, sylvion, Castellion and about to be released Nautilion). They are all great little games and are deceiving in their depth. 

I love dice games so Run Fight or Die!, Deep Dpace D-6 And Pandemic the Cure are great shorter ones for me..
How long have you been gaming for?  I'd suggest not burning yourself out too fast because there comes a point where it's hard enough keeping up with rules, etc.

But you didn't read this comment for my advice, you wanted a game!  I'd suggest **Mage Knight** or **Star Trek: Frontiers** if you prefer a sci-fi theme.  Almost every co-op game out there works as well as a solo game.  I personally haven't played them, but I've heard that **Terraforming Mars**, **Baseball Highlights 2045**, **Scythe**, and **The Networks** all have solid single player modes as well.
I've been playing solo a lot lately and I would recommend: Lord of the Rings LCG, Space Hulk: Death Angel (plays very quickly), Mice & Mystics, and Eldritch Horror.

Edit: Also, Zombicide can be fun for solo play.
I'd start with coops, in particular **Pandemic: The Cure** and play as 3 pawns. Before you laugh, I actually really liked it as a solo game, much more so than with other players. It satisfies the dice chucking urge I get periodically and keeps you interested for the entire 15 or 20 minutes it takes to either win or lose. On a larger scale, **Burgle Bros** would have potential as a soloable coop, especially some of the harder scenarios. Upgrade to epic scale and doing **Eldritch Horror** takes like 4-ish hours, but that's another that I've thought was pretty good as a solo game.  

For wargames, take a look at John Butterfield's D-Day series (e.g. **D-Day at Omaha Beach** or the sequel in the Pacific which escapes my brain at the moment). They are solo only and are really well regarded, in particular, Omaha. Some of the GMT COIN series aren't bad a solo games, but you have to be more invested in the conflict to slog through the solo rules and bot charts and stuff. Those are games where you buy the game, and take a gingerly stroll through it over the course of a month of study (between the rules, the background, etc). I've solo'd **Fire in the Lake** but I really dig the game and time period... I have a friend who plays **Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 – ?** solo and he likes it, but I never tried it so I don't know... Wargames almost necessitate a "wargame table" which you can leave the game setup for a few weeks on and play it a little bit each day or two.  

On the euro front; I enjoyed **Caverna** solo, but it doesn't hold up after 10 or 15 plays. One of the other Uwe farming games like **A Feast for Odin** or **Fields of Arle** are probably better choices (in particular, the former since it has the occasional die roll and card drawing to change it up). My solo euro of choice is **Roads & Boats** which is arguably best at 1p (and I personally sort of swear by it at that count). **Lewis & Clark** was actually ok as a solo game.  
LEAVING EARTH
All these are good as solo with great replayabality:  
**At the Gates of Loyang** - pure optimization puzzle  
**The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** - it has good solo mode  
**CO2** - even though it is semi-cooperative game, it is good as solo game  
**Elder Sign + Unseen Forces** - Yahtzee style with pasted Cthulhu theme  
**Eldritch Horror + Forsaken Lore**  
**Five Tribes** - has official solo variant  
**Ghost Stories** - hard and unforgiving  
**Imperial Settlers** - solo mode is good (not great), but there is official campaign mode I haven't tried  
**Legends of Andor** - euro style puzzle put into fantasy world  
**Lewis & Clark** - I like it's solo mode. You are trying to beat a "clock", neutral player that moves one place a head every turn.  
**Limes** - fairly abstract carcassonne type of game (bingo style for 2 players) that can be played solo (bit your score instead of opponent's)  
**Pandemic**  
**Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island** - highly thematic and hard game  
**Samurai Spirit**  
**Snowdonia** - great solo mode against the neutral company that acts as a timer for the game progress  
Since no one has linked it yet, here are the top 100 solo games as voted on by the 1 Player Guild on BGG:  [2015 People's Choice Top 100 Solo Games](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/200265/2015-peoples-choice-top-100-solo-games)
Caverna was fun by itself the time I did it.
GMT games has a entire Soloability rating on all their games. Stuff like Fire in the Lake or Churchill will do 1
**Samurai Spirit** is a 1-7p game where you play as middle aged furries saving the world through the power of blackjack mechanics.

**Space Hulk: Death Angel** is a 1-6p dungeon crawl that plays exactly like the movie *Aliens*.

Any of the **Pandemic** series, from Cthulhu, to Vanilla, to The Cure, all play very well with two pawns controlled by one guy.
These are all great suggestions, but what kind of games do you like? Give us a top 5. It's easier that way. 
The answer is Kingdom Death: Monster. That is all.
I play a lot of solo and with a job and kids I find it tough to have the energy to play 3 or 4 nights a week (with maybe one night a 2p game with the wife and a group which meets maybe every 3 weeks).

That said (and these are all subject to personal taste). 

**Fields of Arle**, **Agricola**, **A Feast for Odin**, **Terraforming Mars**(latest obsession), **La Granja**, **Silent Victory**, **Eldritch Horror**, **Neanderthal**, **Le Havre**, **Viticultulture** and **Suburbia** are all games I have had good times playing solo. They're all "good games" too IMO and based on general consensus. 
It's OK to have other hobbies. 
Almost all of the Lovecraftian lore games are good for solo plays, as almost all of them are co-op and dripping with lore :

- Arkham Horror
- Arkham Horror LCG
- Eldritch Horror
- Elder Sign
- Mansions of Madness 2.0
- Pandemic Cthulhu

Dungeon Crawl \ Dudes on Map games that are good solo :

- Gears of War
- DnD Adventure Systems
- Descent 2.0 + App
- Star Wars + RedJak's Automated AI (get it on BGG)

Other notable mentions :

- Imperial Settlers + Solo Campaign (BGG)
- Apocalypse Chaos
Scythe has some pretty good solo game rules.  While I have only played it solo once, it was a bit challenging but well worth it.
A good start: https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/52hqmu/solo_penandpaper_games/?
Eldritch Horror or Shadowrun: Crossfire
I've heard that Navajo Wars is good, but I haven't played it. Waiting on the GMT P500 for it. 
Elder Signs: Omens.  The phone version.

It's designed from the start as solitaire and it's very challenging.  It feels a little press-your-luck at times, but there are opportunities to influence the odds.
"I'm so rich, but I want a little more." I'm happy if I can rope somebody into playing once a month.
Friday!
I'm getting Descent with the app to try some solo gaming. Haven't tried it yet so can't say but I've read good things. 
If you've ever seen Rahdo runs through it, many games play fine like that if you want to try a multiplayer game with 1 person. I've only done it a few times to learn a game, but it's been fun all the same
I think at this point, video games and board game apps  are probably your best bet. To me, physical board games just don't lend themselves nearly as well to solo gameplay as digital mediums do.

* **Civilization:** Turn based empire building at its best.

* **[Atlas Reactor](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitaltabletop/comments/592tpk/atlas_reactor_quick_turn_based_multi_player_game/):** My current obsession. Feels very much like a board game IMO.

* **Orcs Must Die:** Tower Defense game. This genre has leaked into board games because there's a similar satisfaction.

* **Dark Souls:** This one is much less similar to board games than my other suggestions. However, the way this game forces you to learn and iterate is similar to what you have to do for many solo board games.
XCOM the board game can be a one player game. You play against the AI app on your phone or tablet. It's a really fun game actually and works for 1-4 players.
My solos at the moment are : **Star Trek Frontiers, Friday, Dominion, Memoir '44, Legends of Andor**.

One thing that's getting me is that I accidentally amassed a bunch of deckbuilders for solo play, and if I don't feel like doing that, I'm short on options.  So make sure you get a variety of core mechanics, and try to reduce overlap.
Heavy: **Mage Knight** is king. The COIN games from GMT are also great, my favorite is **Falling Sky**.

Light/Short: **Sylvion**, **Castellion**, **Deep Space D-6**, and **Pandemic: The Cure** are all solid.

I've actually been really enjoying a couple games with Looney Pyramids from Pyramid Arcade lately, specifically Color Wheel and Solomids, the latter being my favorite. They're just straightforward puzzles but they're quite satisfying and surprisingly engaging.
I've got to say Descent: Journeys into Darkness paired with the Road to Legend App.

Its a crazy cool innovation between physical and digital. It will make you want to buy more and more expansions. Also, you might end up picking up another hobby... mini painting

Can't recommend it strongly enough if you like fantasy.
I just acquired vast a couple weeks ago. I'm anxiously awaiting its debut on the table. The upgrade pack seems very reasonable for previous backers too. 
So I was really interested in this game when it came out and then POOF! It was gone. I'm happy there's another crack at it, with some lessons learned included. 

There seems to be some confusion around pricing, and I'm honestly hoping the creator is reasonable about it. If I'm paying $100 after shipping for a game I *really* hope that includes the stretch goal. A stretch goal by definition should be something included for everyone who buys the game. The price is pretty steep as it is, and I hope that no one is going to try and get more money out of backers for something that I consider already paid for. 

All that said: I'm very much looking forward to the game! I hope the business part of it gets sorted out. 
I am really thinking about getting a copy of this but I want to know if people think it is replayable enough for $60 plus tax. Honestly curious! Not trying to be negative or anything.

Thanks!
I feel like my wife and I would love this, but getting anyone else in would be hard. How does it play with 2?
Wait, I had placed an order for the second printing on the creator's website. Does this mean those preorders are out the window?
Awesome. This is one that I regretted not picking up at GC. Glad it got a 2nd printing so I can snag one.
Ugh, damn you. I just backed :-)
Upgrade pledge!  Minis!
Thanks for the notice! I've been hoping for a 2nd printing and March isn't that far away. 
Seemingly no way for first edition backers to get that sixth player, which is super disappointing. I highly recommend the game though. Very fun.
I just love the concept of this game so much. Think the miniatures are really what the game was missing first time around it seems to make the differences feel more apparent/immediate. great to see a 2nd run. Got to get some extra cash to put on this if I can.
Question for all: Is this a game that casual boardgamers will like to play? From what I hear the gameplay is fun, but keeping track of all the different rules seems like something only regular gamers will enjoy.
So I've got a question. When I bought this at Gen Con it came with all these great wooden pieces. Well the cave has 6 purple squares and I can not for the life of me figure out what they're for. 
I ordered the 1st ed off the site after demoing it at GenCon and just backed the mini's off KS! Excited! I love the artwork and asymmetry of this game.
More stretch goals to come I hope. Will actually probably take the kickstarter plunge and get this. 
~£85 GBP all told for the game, 5 miniatures and shipping to UK. That's before the ghost gets costed as an add on. Jeeeeeeeeesus.

You have to really like the idea of the game to shell out what will be approaching £100 post-ghost. Going to have to pass on the miniatures to get it nearer £60 pre-ghost, a shame but probably puts it in the ball park of 'worth it for such a unique game' at that point. For me, it just comes down to the price of any addons.
Interesting to see the second print running get a KS. I passed on it first time round, but having seen such positive feedback, and as a wannabe designer, I feel like this is something I need to pick up.
Another KS not dealing properly with shipping outside the US again.

105 bucks for the whole game of this size? Pass.
Hmm, anyone know if the upgrade kits and minis will be available after the KS ends and/or at retail? This is a terrible time to run a Kickstarter, imo, with the holiday season and all.
Do we have any idea on how to get the ghost and the price of the addon pack? Will it come with both a standee and a meeple like the other components? Will the ghost get its own single sheet rules cheat like the other 5 roles?

Will the 2nd print see the light of day beyond KS? $75 is steep. Really kicking myself for waiting until the last day to buy this at Gencon...
Is it safe to assume the minis won't be painted? 
I'm guessing that upgrade pack is only for 1st edition owners and the 2nd edition will have the upgraded rules and player boards included. Figuring out how to purchase this game is getting a little complicated. 
Two starters in one year? That's mad. 

I was interested in this until i heard the ending plays out like munchkin. Can anyone agree or disagree?
[deleted]
Are they making it look any better in the second printing or is the ugly purple and cluttered iconography on the cave yikes still there? 
I own Descent and played a couple of games of Conan over the weekend. I enjoyed both but here's the pros and cons in my humble opinion:

**Descent**

Pros:

* Huge replayability due to scenarios, maps and hero selection.
* Good variety of skills and mechanics for characters and minions alike.
* Campaign is really well constructed.
* Endlessly expandable.

Cons:

* Can feel a little *busy* at times, especially late in the campaign, with huge amounts going on due to equipment and scenario mechanics.
* Some scenarios feel a little unbalanced.
* I found the lore / theme a bit generic and weak
* Miniatures aren't great quality

**Conan**

Pros:

* Outstanding miniatures
* Battles and games feel action packed
* Action point system overall and initiative order system (for the overlord) are really well crafted and a blast to play
* Theme and lore are really good

Cons:

* Feels a little simpler than the Descent and less characters, which may adversely affect replayability.
* No campaign (although this is coming soon I hear) 
* Not as much map variety due to being board based as opposed to modular.

Hope this helps, and bear in mind I've played about 20 games of the Descent and only two of Conan
I only played Descent and own about a 1/4 of its whole content. 

Since Descent and IA are both in a same-y system with a different skin, I'd rather pick another system. However, you should consider again if you aren't comfortable with certain revealing miniatures (which I know I am, but I'm sure you did some research about that) or don't care for the IP.
Descent seems like the thinker's game while Conan is just hack 'n' slash, but it feels like the opposite after you play them. Descent is actually something you can play pretty casually like a lighter RPG without any need for role-playing. Conan is almost like a puzzle in comparison. While there is randomness due to dice, both sides have to think very carefully about movement and how much energy they should spend.  If you waste your energy thoughtlessly you will straight up lose the game due to how energy carries over through rounds.
**Gloomhaven**...
There aren't any games specifically *designed* for it that I know of, but there are a large number of games that it could be done with.  Basically anything without hidden knowledge should be fine, abstract strategy like Chess or tile-laying like Carcassonne will work just fine for that kind of thing.  
A game that you'll need to leave out for several days... Hmm...

Only one title really comes to mind. [The Campaign For North Africa](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4815/campaign-north-africa).
I think **Diplomacy** would be interesting like this. Like a week long trip with friends where a game of **Diplomacy** is going on in the background constantly. Any time you are alone with someone you start plotting, during meals you talk of war etc. 

Im pretty sure this would be the most efficent way of losing friends forever.
There is the free online version of **Food Chain Magnate**, it's not designed to be played in this fashion, but you can definitely play a game over a few days if you choose.
Chess and checkers have both fit the bill in households I've lived in.
You can probably play **Mage knight** that way.

~~**Twilight Struggle**~~

Well, basically every game where your turns cannot be interfered by any opponents while you are taking the can be play that way.
What we plan to do is buy a bunch of small magnets and glue them to Carcassonne game pieces and use a white board with metallic backing when we move into our new house to play on and write basic notes. Obviously buying a second set purely for this plan. 

Taluva would be a good option too.
Designed? Not really. 

Games that I do this for? Most wargames I play solitaire. 
Abstract strategy is a good genre for this. Off the top of my head, I'd recommend Blokus, for just you and your wife you may want to do the two player travel edition.
I think **Carcasonne** fits this
Pretty much any turn-based 2p game could do this. All you need is a turn marker to show who needs to play next.
**Through the Ages** online seems to play like that.
Any game where your opponent has literally zero agency on your turn fits. No dice rolling or card picking or anything. Traditionally chess and scrabble are good games for this. They both have no off-turn agency and each turn is impactful to the overall game. 

Thinking of modern games Carcassonne springs to mind pretty quick. Tsuro would be a good one too. Maybe tokaido. Basically think of a game where each turn is impactful and you never have to consult opponents for actions on your turn
I *think* Patchwork would work, been a while since I've played it. 
If you look at http://yucata.de/en, they have a ton of play by email games and slight changes to normal games rules to make that work great. I especially think their Russian Roads and Castles of Burgundy implementations work out fantastically. You could play CoB with those changes easily

A stacking game might be fun like this (something like Wonky or Jenga).  You could be somewhere else in the house and then hear "NOOOoooo!!" followed by the sound of pieces falling everywhere. :)
**Push Fight** comes to mind. Getting your hands on it isn't the easiest and not everyone enjoys abstract strategy games, but the anchor piece means it's easy to see whose turn it is.
Not a board game, but videogames like Subterfuge are designed for that. Also, this vertical chess board.

http://digital.hammacher.com/Items/11951/11951_1000x1000.jpg

Concept would work well.
**18EA** would be ideal. 
Literally any game right? (edit: except real-time games!)
**LOTR LCG** is probably the best solo lcg, however a huge aspect of the game is planning for the quest and building a deck to take it on. If that doesn't appeal to you, then check out **Arkham Horror lcg** which just started and most people (including myself) are really enjoying it. It mixes rpg and deck building and is really elegantly designed compared to other similar card games.
Lord of the Rings is the best I've seen.
I recently got into the LotR LCG myself and would also like to put in my two cents about it. It's the first LCG I've played, but I really like it. It's a lot of fun to play solo. You'll get a decent amount of play time out of the core set.

I haven't had a chance to play the Arkham Horror LCG yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
**LotR LCG**. This is far and away the most developed, interesting, dramatic, amazing solo card game experience I've ever had.
I imagine your best places to start are **LOTR: LCG** and/or **Arkham Horror: the Card Game - LCG**. I've only played AHLCG. I chose AH over LOTR, because I'd heard that LOTR was a lot more 'card gamey' - with card combos and interactions being the meat of the game. The game wasn't designed for campaign play - that mode was added later. I think the main way the game is played is that you grab an individual scenario, build your deck specifically to try and beat it and then attempt to beat it. This means there's less narrative, it's a bit more 'cynical' and there's a lot more deckbuilding required for each play. Also your deck just abstractly represents 'the good guys'. Your characters are also either in an abstract 'aether' or at a specific location. 

AH on the other hand was designed for campaign play from the ground up. You build your deck at the start of the campaign, but then only tweak it between scenarios, spending XP gained on new cards, or even on higher level versions of cards already in your deck. Your deck also represents a single investigator - your avatar in the game - they have a class or class combination and deckbuilding rules specific to them, as well as a unique special item and weakness. The gameplay itself is a bit more of a mix of RPG/LCG compared to LOTR and it has a spatial element as various locations are placed on the table, creating a 'board'. 

Because AH has just released it's potentially easier, less expensive and less daunting to catch up on. YMMV on all of the above of course. 
I don't think you can go wrong with LOTR LCG or Arkham LCG. I only have played LOTR (picking up Arkham around Christmas) & it's a deep, rich experience that captures the core material perfectly. 

I've been immensely enjoying the game, and I'm someone that typically hates card games like MTG. 
Everyone is recommending LOTR or AH LCGs, but as fast as I know these are the only two solo LCGs in the market. Are there some other that I'm not aware of?
**Lord of the Rings: LCG** and **Arkham Horror: LCG** are both truly excellent solo experiences.  I suggest getting into the one that seems more thematically interesting for you.  

Mechanically, LotR is more focused on individual scenarios and building a deck to defeat that specific scenario.  Arkham is more focused on evolving a deck through a series of linked scenarios.

Both offer a lot of rich choices and a lot of interesting and enjoyable unexpected events.  Both are highly recommended.
Pathfinder is best played on ios or android. it helped you on diminish setup and card organizing fiddlyness. Especially when you have card pool of multiple scenarios
You can play many popular Android: Netrunner decks without necessarily having an opponent.
I recently played for the first time with the solo rules.  It was much less complicated than I expected.  I watched a lot of videos beforehand and read through the walkthrough twice before sitting down to play ... but everything made sense.  I recommend it.
The fact that you and your brother are ready and willing to make the plunge makes me think you'll be able to pick it up, you'll just need to do a little research. [This](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB7C824980F797C4A) is the definitive play through for Mage Knight, and it helped me learn the game a lot personally. You'll get a feel for the game and it'll likely confirm or deny your desire to purchase it.

The next step is getting the game and being willing to make rule mistakes. You'll realize four turns too late that you forgot to apply the City boon to the monsters or something, but by then there's nothing you can do about it. Press on soldier, and learn from it for next time (I still forget City boons all the time).

Just know that this isn't a wild romp through a fantasy countryside, but a meticulous and brilliant variation of puzzles to effectively solve. 

If you really want to delve into some good strategy, I'd recommend this guys videos: [Link](https://youtu.be/_TqMtDOVpvo) (they're quite long though, and obviously not recommended if you don't know the rules. Wait until you get that undying urge to play, haha).
I don't think Mage Knight is that hard to learn, and it has a good tutorial. The tricky bit is remembering to apply all the various rules at the right point, but forgetting to do so won't ruin your game you'll be able to oops and play on.

The biggest barrier is that the rule bookies atrocious as reference material.

I dived into Mage Knight as one of my first solo experiences, though I feel my background in Roborally was good prep.
MK is often referenced as one of the most complex games ever made, but that's really hyperbole. It's heavy and long, yes, but most of the rules are pretty intuitive once you have a bit of familiarity with the system. There are a lot of little things that you'll forget for your first couple games, but the map location reference cards have most of the important information on them.

Just play the walkthrough first and you should be fine. If it turns out to be too much for you, you can always resell it for very close to that price.
Be prepared to grind through some learning games.  That said, I have a group of three that plays every week and the game just keeps getting better.  Runs like a well oiled machine now.
I think it's somewhat overrated game and has too many things going on for what it really offers compared to more focused games. I can see the appeal for some people but for me it didn't work a bit. Since you aren't very experienced on heavier games, there's a good chance MK will be too much too soon.

I also think there are plenty of better options for the different aspects/mechanics that Mage Knight has crammed in it but there certainly isn't many games that offer the same variety for what it's worth.

For competitive dungeon crawling game, I'd go with Arcadia Quest. For tile placement exploration and resource management I recommend Robinson Crusoe and for RPG/dungeon crawling co-op gaming I would choose Descent or Imperial Assault. IA is actually 1 vs many but it should get a companion app which makes it fully co-op. It also offers a brilliant 1 vs 1 skirmish mode.
It's really not hard. Just plow ahead and make some rules mistakes, fix them later. Very fun and rewarding; $50 is a steal.
I would suggest doing your research beforehand (Assuming you haven't already). It's a very dense and "crunchy" game that's for sure. A guy in my game group purchased it a a local convention two years ago and it has yet to be played all the way through.

We started the introductory scenario shortly after he purchased it. We both enjoyed it enough; just not enough to warrant it's long set up time and rules explination.

That being said quite a few people on this sub love the game to death. It does have an awesome sense of progression.
**Mage Knight** is a really really tough game to learn and play.  BUT only one person needs to know all of the rules.  You can surprisingly teach others how to play the game easily in under 5-10 minutes once you know how to play and it's surprisingly a simple game to grasp.  So as long as one of you is committed to learning the rules then it actually could work.  But just bear in mind that for me personally I watched probably 2+ hours worth of tutorials, an hour or two worth of gameplay, played a solo campaign, and it wasn't until then that I felt like I was comfortable with the rules.  AND GUESS WHAT?!  I haven't played the game for a solid year, so I might have to do it all over again if I decide to play it!

Great game, but expect it to gather dust.
My group has played Mage Knight a lot in coop in the past, but part of the reason we stopped is because it is just too long of a game with significant barriers to entry.

While we do love the game overall, every single time we sat down to play it, it would take at least an hour to setup, another 30 minutes to just refresh on the rules enough to get started playing, and lots of constant rules checks ever single time we ran into a combat, exposed a new tile with a new location type, tried to recruit a soldier, etc...

If you have the time and patience to play a game for 6+ hours, it is an amazing experience.  As Shut Up & Sit Down said, "Its a gamer's game".  It is intense to say the least.  Be sure to go to BGG and print out a set of rules, at least the back page with all the combat effects, for each player.

If you want a slightly faster experience that is less error prone, I would have to advise against getting it.
My partner and I are long distance, so we play a ton of games over skype!   


**Games where both have a copy**  
Smash up - completely perfect distance. Even if you just divide up a few decks to take with you. We use to use and online text editor to keep track of base scores, but it is easy to do over skype as well.  


epic spell wars - Fantastic. Each person basically deals with their own cards, then tells how many points of damage. Perfect for skype.  


Unspeakable words - A great word game that is super simple to play distance!  


**Games where only one person has a copy**  
Castle Panic - cooperative game, so if your friends have the game and board, it is easy for you to tell them what monsters you wish to kill. Normally all cards are laid out for everyone to see, so translates easily to skype.  


Forbidden Island/Desert - Another co-op game, super easy to play distance, since nothing is secret, and everyone works together. Just tell the other players where to move you, and have them draw up storm cards.
**Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective** works really well like this. More appropriately, **The Martian Investigations** (which I wrote) and **Mythos Tales** are both similar to Consulting Detective, but can be bought as PDF files and can be played on screen, so it's easier and cheaper to get the multiple copies you need.
Diplomacy works well
Idk how many are you but maybe **specter ops** if you are the spy just ask one of your friends to read the cards and you choose 2(or 3 idont remember) and have them announce their grid at the end of each movement to keep track on your sheet, and if you are the agent again keep track on the sheet. 
I've had some success playing Zombicide: Black Plague and D&D: Temple of Elemental Evil (a board game) entirely over Hangouts, with no two players in the same room. I imagine they would work well with just one remote player as well. 
Dungeon Crawlers should work if you see the board via webcam.

**Codenames**, **Small World**, Pen and Paper RPGs, storytelling games like **Once upon a time** or **Western City** or **Fiasco**, **Russian Railroads**, **Village**, **Axis&Allies**, etc.
If you take the right bits with you **Letters from Whitechapel**

You'll have to be Jack, but that will work really well if you have the player screen as it has the map on...
I would say most games without hidden information (especially co-op) would work well. You would obviously need your own copy for the dice games, or have somebody doing the rolling for you. A quick glance at my collection and I would say all of the following should be doable (unless I remember the rules wrong, which might very well be the case):

* Puerto Rico
* Troyes
* Dominant Species
* Formula De
* Robinson Crusoe
* El Grande (have a list of all your cards and mark them as you "play" them. Write down on paper when choosing region)
* King of Tokyo/New York
* Carson City
* Machi Koro
* Leader 1
* Nuns on the run
* Eclipse
* Descent
* Imperial Assault
* Super Fantasy: Ugly Snouts Assault
* Conan
* Mission Red Planet (If you have somebody showing you the event cards)
* Ground Floor
* Rush n Crush

Edit: realized I had a couple more games
**SeaFall** seems like the odd man out on that list, and I'd recommend you research it pretty thoroughly (avoiding spoilers if possible).  Our group found it *very* dry and it turned out to be the first legacy game we quit without finishing.  Some people love it, but it's definitely not going to appeal to everyone.
You can also give a shot at the [D&D board games:](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/9547/dungeons-and-dragons-adventure-system-board-games)

* Dungeons & Dragons: [Castle Ravenloft Board Game (2010)](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/59946/dungeons-dragons-castle-ravenloft-board-game)
* Dungeons & Dragons: [Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game (2011)](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/66356/dungeons-dragons-wrath-ashardalon-board-game)
* Dungeons & Dragons: [The Legend of Drizzt Board Game (2011)](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91872/dungeons-dragons-legend-drizzt-board-game)
* Dungeons & Dragons: [Temple of Elemental Evil Board Game (2015)](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172220/temple-elemental-evil-board-game)
That list looks pretty solid for games with that dungeon crawl / rpg feeling!

For more dungeon crawl games, check out **Star Wars: Imperial Assault**, **Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia** and **Super Dungeon Explore**. I haven't played any of those yet myself, but they all sound like a lot of fun!

Out of curiosity, what did you do wrong in your first M&M playthrough? My first playthrough was with my gf and I totally forgot that you *start* with abilities and don't have to level up to get one. Fortunately I noticed that rule in the middle of our first big fight with a centipede, which really saved our butts. Too bad we still lost the chapter!
As far as painting goes, Sorastro has a YouTube channel and does great instructional videos on specific game's miniatures and how to paint them. [Imperial Assault Painting Guide ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZUsfAtyEM0) 

Haven't found a mice and mystics video I liked.
**Descent** is the king of dungeon crawlers in terms of the amount of content, if nothing else. I love it and play every week with a group of friends. The 1 vs. all aspect is appealing to a lot of groups. Many of the others are full co-op (not a bad thing, just different).  
At the same time, if you have a game that you like and that you play a lot, there's nothing wrong with focusing on that for a while. Play the base game, get the expansions, paint the figures. Really get your money's worth out of it.
**Gloomhaven** looks really good, but it's basically unknown at this point. We'll have to wait for reports from the KS backers.  
M&M is on my list, actually. I love the look of the miniatures (especially the undead cat from one of the expansions). Speaking of miniatures, don't forget to check out /r/minipainting for another friendly and helpful community. 
The genre is very "samey" be careful of fatigue if you buy too many at once.  Why not try a different style of game?
T.I.M.E. Stories
How did you play it with 5? Other than the last mission there is a maximum of 4 mice per mission (or less for some)
Quick question: Does M&M require a "game master" antagonist type player or is it 100% co-op like Zombicide?

One of my biggest complaints about Imperial Assualt is I'm always stuck playing the empire.
I have Gloomhaven preordered :) Wasn't a huge fan of Descent.
How do you tolerate the endless rolling and movement of M&M?  I want to like this game so much, but damn them dice.

Seconding what most people said about Seafall being the odd one out.

I'd highly recommend both *Star Wars: Imperial Assault* and *Shadows of Brimstone*.

Imperial Assault is an RPG in a Box but requires a DM of sorts. The players play as rebellion heroes (custom ones from the game, not Han Luke etc) and the DM plays as the imperials. Imperials have to manage things like reinforcements, map setup, event triggers, etc. which are all outlined in a scenario book. Example: open door to building, reveal the enemies inside as an event.

The cool part about Imperial Assault is it's not like Mice and Mystics where if you fail a mission you start over. There's branching path stories / missions! Fail most missions, simply take a different path, and you can get different endings too.

*Shadows of Brimstone* is a little more controversial I think on this board. It's a Kickstarter from a few years ago where the distribution and other things weren't handled well. It wasn't due to any sort of intentional neglect, more just "oh shit we seriously over promised and didn't expect this much interest". 

The game itself is a DM-less RPG / dungeon crawler like Mice and Mystics. You play as a hero, but you get a character sheet. You gain levels, have stats, increase abilities, and make saving rolls and stuff more like D&D. There's no real end to the game, you play scenarios in the book. The actual role-playing is light, as there's a board. You reveal a map tile by tile and build a dynamic mine/dungeon. You discover portals to alternate dimensions. You get gear/loot, fight monsters, and accidentally mutate a second head, which gives you super powers.

There's also a town interlude for you to stock up on gear, and spend your cash. Or, you know, you accidentally destroy the town. 

This is a game HEAVY on random events. The rules are super complex. But it's thematic as HELL and leads to awesome character interactions and stuff.
This has not been released yet but try to look for **Near and Far**. While it is not a coop game, it has heavy story elements. A more focused version of **Tales of Arabian Nights**, as far as I can see.
I would put forward Mansions of Madness as well. It's very narrative driven, has a quick set up, and is a great break from sci-fi/fantasy genres that tend to dominate the hobby.

Each scenario plays like a one shot, but it can stretch across multiple hours (you can save your progress). I think it would do well with your group.
I own Mice and Mystics, Descent 2.0 and it's expansions, and Arcadia Quest.

All the games are great, but I love [**Arcadia Quest**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155068/arcadia-quest).  It has the ability to just pick up and play a game or two with friends, but also has a robust campaign where you can acquire items and weapons.  Like Mice and Mystics, it has no Overlord so everyone plays, but it also has Player vs. Player, so in addition to level quests, you can kill you opponent.  It means every player is on their own, so no quarterbacking from one player trying to min/max every turn, but dying doesn't remove you from the game.  Finally, every player has 3 characters they run, so you aren't stuck just doing one thing, like a warrior.  You can have it all.

Arcadia Quest is outstanding, and should be up for consideration.

SIDE NOTE. Tracking activity of the company on Social Media and getting conclusions about the status of the company based on Social Media posts might be not the best idea. As our fans saw on Social Media, for the past 3 weeks Portal Games was moving to the new offices. We were moving whole warehouse, offices, everything. Our webstore and our wholesale distribution was closed for two weeks and information about it was posted in the webstore. The whole company was stopped for three weeks. We were packing stuff, moving stuff and unpacking stuff. Basically company was moving products and not working.

It didn't stopped our marketing. It actually made it even more active. We were excited about this big event. We were posting videos on Snapchat and pictures on Twitter very intense. It was exactly what our fans expected - be part of this super important moment in the history of the company. We were active on Social, because we love our fans and we interact with them. Being close to fans and talk with them on FB or Twitter has nothing to do with the fact that for three weeks the company was basically closed and in moving process. 
I'm surprised to hear this - I've always had good support experiences with Portal. They've sent me a number of replacement parts, as well as helped me with some ordering issues. As someone said, maybe things got lost in the Essen/BGG.CON madness?
My dealings with Portal Games has been nothing but professional.  I'm sure your problem can be solved.
I am Polish, and I agree they should engage way more to support their customers. 

I love Imperial Settlers game, it's one of my favorites. But I don't have any expansion - this is because my version - first release is not compatible with expansions. They have made error in cards and newer prints come with updated cards. They suggested people to print and glue notes on the cards... 

I will say this loud - Fuck that Portal Games. I would buy expansions if you could add  those UPDATED CARDS from basic game for free. But they refuse, ignorant bastards. People even asked if they can pay to get those cards but answer was not. Ridiculous.... 

When I am stuck desperately trying to communicate with a business on social networking systems because they don't have a clear and easy way to communicate with them by a proper website contact page or email address, I am quick to sour on dealing with them. Very unprofessional, IMO.

I've never dealt with these guys directly, probably never will since I live in Canada, but I feel your misery. 
I had similar issues with Portal Games when I pre-ordered 51st State Master set from them.

Originally they promised copies would arrive roughly a month before the stores got their copies. 

Then they stopped talking about when they were going to ship it. Then they sent me a shipping notice with no tracking information. Local stores got copies in, my copy was still on the way. 

I emailed them, they told me to check the website that I'd not only already checked, but included screenshots from; screenshots that showed a lack of tracking information. I tweeted them, they told me to email them. I posted questions to their site, those questions got moderated. I was not impressed.

Eventually, my copy arrived, in good condition. However, the experience turned me off pre-ordering from them again. 

At one point, I asked them if it would be cheaper to use a Canadian reshipping company, mentioned one by name. I was told that they'd talked to them, and it wasn't viable. From my own dealings with that company, it is very doubtful that they were spoken to.  

They talk a good game, but they don't really live up to it. I won't pre-order first martians from them, assuming I even buy it at this point.    
How did you pay? You should go through the bank/paypal and open a case dispute. You were lied to via false advertising, they will listen if you involve money. Also; keep it formal, respectful and don't get emotional!
Dumb question, since , of course you did, but: Did you check your spam folder?
Probably just busy with the con season. Merry, Ignacy's wife was very helpful when a copy of 51st State I'd purchased from Milan Spiele was missing a whole sheet of tokens. 

If you don't get any response, you can always contact the designer(s) through bgg or even Facebook. I did that (bgg mail) for some missing ships for Madeira, and I got the publisher's contact through them.
Con season?
I've been in email contact with portalgames support about some damaged/missing Imperial Settlers Aztecs promos from the copy I preordered.  
They claim they sent out the replacement pretty much right away; it's been about 3 weeks, but I don't count that as late yet.  
So far I don't have anything bad to say about them. Will see, if the cards don't arrive in another few weeks.
I played this game when it was in an early-stage development phase and I loved it!
All my support!
I was a backer on the first campaign glad to see you guys back for another try.
~35 upvotes and 0 comments? Good job getting shills to come vote for you. 
Huh. I wasn't very impressed. A lot of niche or lower-tier games. I didn't do an exhaustive search, but here are a few items that stood out to me.

**Battle Line** -- $12

**Trains** -- $25

**Pagoda** -- $16

**King of Tokyo (2nd Edition)** -- $20
Maybe CoolStuff will have a better sale.   

I had a really hard time just getting to the $100 free S&H mark, and even then emptied my cart since half of it was just.... I *could* get these things, but I don't really want/need them.   

The last 2 MM sales were much better.
**Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle** for $32 is a pretty good deal
Unfortunately, nothing of interest to me in this sale.  The closest was Potion Explosion, but I won't be picking anything up.
And the crowd goes mild.... 
I just bought **Pandemic: Rise of Cthulhu** and I see it on there for half the price. Just my luck.
I'd get **Imhotep** if I didn't already have it. Nothing else really interesting
I always look forward to MM sales just to see how low **Warmachine: High Command** will go.

If shipping costs weren't an issue for me I'd grab the game just to see if it's THAT bad.
Stuff's getting sold out fast of all the things I want. 3 things in a row - it's In Stock when I look but after adding to the cart it's out of stock a minute or two later.
I picked up Agents of SMERSH (2nd Edition) Bundle for $32. Been told it's a good one for fans of Tales of the Arabian Nights.
Noticed Pandemic Legacy and Falling Sky in there, but going to pass on this one.
If you like Seafall it's on sale for 42$ (56$ on amazon to compare).
Nothing for me either, womp. The inventory on sale seems to be spread "too thin" if that makes any sense
. For instance with miniatures, there are very few items for each faction under each game.  
I ended up getting:

* **Garbage Day Silver Can Edition**
* **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong**
* and **Flock, because what the hell, it's seven bucks.**
**Guilds of London** almost made me jump, but I'm not sure I'll enjoy it as much as others so I think I can pass...wallet and shelves saved!
Lagoon is $8. This game was wrongfully overlooked. Really beautiful art and a fun game of setting up combos and positioning around a shifting board.

Two of the Exceed sets are $13 (each), and quite a steal as well. This is a fighting card game similar to Battlecon, from the same company.
started to fill my cart with about a dozen games until I realised how ludicrous their Canadian shipping fees are.
The sale a few weeks ago was better for me.  Didn't have a ton of games I was looking to buy, but none of them really stood out price-wise on this one.  Shrug
Thank god, I made it out alive. Nothing too interesting this time around.
Pick up Craftsmen if you aren't afraid of heavy games.
Selection is a little muted. No major big standouts to me. Only game I wanted, 51st State: Master Set, was sold out real quick :(
Ended up getting **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** and **Legendary Encounters: Firefly** as two items on sale, and nabbed a copy of **7 Wonders Duel** (NOT a sale item) because I played it for the first time last week and fell in love with it.  Add some new twists into my collection with Firefly and Duel, and Deception came more from how fast **Secret Hitler** landed as our go-to big group game.
Not really great for those not in the US
And everything I am interested in is Out of Stock.
I almost jumped on **Burano**, **Guilds of London**, **Archon** and **Falling Skies**. Unfortunately Burano was the only one I was about to pull the trigger on but it went out of stock. I also really wanted Falling Skies....but I have 3 other COIN games that I haven't played yet and I am not sure when they will get played 
The Rune Age expansion was the only thing that interested me. Most of this stuff has been on clearance for months with no real price change. 
They have Cockroach Poker for $9.00  

I highly recommend it. It always gets a good reaction and gets played more than once when it gets pulled out. Plays in minutes, so it's a perfect fun filler.
Anybody know if they're going to do a Cyber Monday sale?
My takeaway: 

I 'overpaid' for some of my games. 

Including one or two which are still sitting in a MM 'Customer Hold' waiting for a few pre-ordered expansions. 

(I hope they all reach MM in time to reach me before Christmas. Not because they're gifts, but because the holidays are a great time to play board games and I'd love to have a stack of new ones. Alas, board game release dates are mighty fickle.)

...though I am currently waffling on adding Potion Explosion to my Customer Hold... hopefully I'll waffle long enough for it to sell out; this month is getting expensive.
[deleted]
The oldest game on my shelf is **Forbidden Island**. I don't pull it out as often as I used to, but I'll never turn down a game. It was one of the first ones I picked up when I initially got interested in board games. 

**Hive** is also an evergreen. I keep discovering more layers to it. More ways to interact with the bugs, more combinations to stun and encircle the opponent's queen. Helps that it's super-durable as well. 

As far as sheer number of plays, that crown is squarely on the head of **Carcassonne**. When we can't decide on something, it's Carcassonne. When we're too drunk/tired/irritable/distracted for other games? Carcassonne. When there's people new to boardgames? Carcassonne. It's almost universally applicable.

edit - I took "oldest" to mean "what I've owned the longest." Apparently others took it to mean when a game was released. Oh well.
For me it's Agricola. Primarily plays it with my SO and it has been our favorite game ever since. The amount of decks and expansions just keeps it going for us. Replayability is quite high and it leaves us talking about different strategies and card combos until now and it has been close to two years.
You guys are making me feel like an old fart...

**El Grande** is mine.  Classic that inspired countless of today's designers.
We tend to get rid of games after a few plays if they don't excite us or don't  offer enough depth/variability. Some games that we've had for a year+ that still get played are:

Istanbul  
Concordia  
Kanban  
The Gallerist  
Race for the Galaxy  
Castles of Burgundy  
Keyflower  
Battleline  
Quantum  
Pictomania  
Codenames  

Some that I see sticking around are Food Chain Magnate, Battlecon, Hive, Fields of Arle and probably Feast for Odin.
I still play Acquire (which is older than the vast majority of folks in this sub), Can't Stop, History of the World, El Grande, Settlers of Catan, Tigris and Euphrates, and Alhambra.
Battlestar Galactica
Dominion.

First game I bought back in 2012 when I joined the hobby, still play it pretty regularly. Most games we play a whole bunch once we first get it and then basically never touch it again.

Not Dominion though.
I've been playing board games as a major hobby since I was newly married in 2003 and dabbled in them throughout my life.

**Can't Stop** - The best filler game of all time for 2 to 3 players. I've played it hundreds of times and I never tire of it. The best part is a game only lasts 10 to 15 minutes.

**Dominion** - Not nearly as old as some of my other games, but it has gotten consistent play throughout the years. It helps that it is easy to learn, has lots to master and pretty quick to play.

**Goa** - The best auction game I've ever played. This game works great for any number 2 to 4 and plays within 60 to 90 minutes once learned.

**Kingsburg** - The best dice rolling game (although Troyes may be close) that I have played. It looks complicated at first, but is fairly simple to learn if taught by someone who knows what to do. The expansion, while not necessary, gives it a lot of 

**Cosmic Encounter** - This one breaks my heart. I've owned it for years and love the game. It's fell through with all of my friends because they all play it wrong. These same friends, who can be cold and heartless in other games, play way too nice in this game. I love the negotiation and special powers in the game and think it's one of the best all time games. If only I could play it more.
"Auf Achse", which was "Spiel des Jahres" in 1987 and was first released in 1982, is still one of my most regularly played games.
Been in the hobby about 15 years now, and there are two games from relatively early on that we still play regularly:

* **Railways of the World** (Railroad Tycoon edition)
* **Acquire**
I got Small World when it came out and I still pull it out on a regular basis. I also have a crapton of expansions for it.
It's Marvel Legendary bought it a few years ago and no deck builder has managed to dethrone it although a few are looking interesting (Clank!, Gloomhaven?, and even the Attack on Titan card game.) 
**Descent** is mine by far. I've been playing since the 1st edition came out (well, maybe a year or so after release). My friend back home has all the 1E stuff. When I got back into gaming after moving across the country, Descent 2E was the first game I bought.  
Honorable mention to **Axis and Allies** which I don't play as often, but I've had one edition or another for ~20 years, making it my longest owned game by a mile.
**Agricola**

**Forbidden Island**

**Stone Age**

**Carcassone**
I've had [Republic of Rome](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1513/republic-rome) since 1991 and I still play it about twice a year.

I'd play it more but it's a heavy game so getting a group together is tough.
Caylus
Surprisingly it is **Settlers of Catan**. No matter how many games my group plays, we always enjoy a good game of 5-6 player Catan. 
Top 10 games from before 2003:

**Elfenland** 

**Tikal**

**Citadels**

**Lost Cities**

**Bohnanza**

**Modern Art**

**Odin's Ravens**

**Hera & Zeus**

**TransAmerica**

**Carcassonne**
Acquire is the game that has withstood the test of time.  Pit is another fun quick game to end a game night.

Diplomacy and Advance Civilization come out a few times a year 
Honestly, **Fluxx**. Especially with the plethora of versions out there - with **Monty Python Fluxx** and **Star Fluxx** being favorites. It's a game people are willing to play even when the plan wasn't to play games, we play at least one session every game night, and themed rules break out a lot of chuckles. Fluxx isn't complicated, and it quick to teach, which helps. Fluxx was the "gateway drug" for a lot of my friends.
Forbidden Island was already said, I think my next best one is Dixit. Very Cards Against Humanity / Apples to Apples feel but just enough depth.
The longest one that's still in our collection would be our original copy of **RoboRally**, which I bought in '95.

We still have our copy of **Settlers of Catan** (alongside **Seafarers of Catan** and **Cities and Knights of Catan** and the full 5-6 player expansions for all) that I bought in 1998. The only thing that's changed about it is I replaced the resource cards. It doesn't get played as often as it used to, but it still gets played. 

Same with our copies of **Ra** and **Carcassonne**, both of which we purchased pretty close to launch ('99 and '00, respectively).  
For my group it is battle star galactica it is the one game that is guaranteed to be played multiple times a year with my group
Both of the 2-player Catan games that were released back in the 90s still shine. 7 Wonders Duel is getting a lot of press but I find it inferior to either of them. I believe they re-released the medieval themed 2p Catan recently but I haven't tried it, hopefully it's as good as the predecessor.
I've got some classic SPI and Avalon Hill games that we make a point of playing as a group from time to time.  

I'm especially keen on a double blind game of AH's Submarine.  One group plays the escorts and directs the convoy; the other plays the attacking Wolfpack. One guy acts as the judge to resolve all the spotting between the two groups.  

I used to think that was a boring job for the poor bloke tasked with it, but he simply loved seeing how Uboats would squirm to avoid the depth charges or watch in bafflement as the escorts left a big gap for a few Uboats to exploit.  He said it was better than any submarine movie he's ever watched.
 
He got a lot of exercise though as we had the escorts/convoy set up on a map upstairs and the submarines had their own map downstairs...you know...for authenticity.
For me it's [Merchant of Venus](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131646/merchant-venus-second-edition). I played the first edition a lot, and now play the second. Good economic game with different routes each time.
Ogre. I've owned and played various versions of it since the 1980s, and still play my DE version regularly with all the expansions.
Ra and Puerto Rico are my two I've owned longest that I've played the most.  The Ra is a 2008 edition and the Puerto Rico is the release year one.  I own Glory to Rome as well, which is as old as Puerto Rico, but I only acquired it a few years ago.  I still play all three a ton.  
Surprisingly, Lords of Waterdeep and its expansion remains at the top of my most played till date. I've had a lot of people dismiss it as a simple worker placement game, but the scope for deviousness from the base game itself has made it a hit.

And the usual euros such as Concordia, Castles, La Isla, Terra Mystica, Alchemists etc will all be around for a long time.
For me Carcassonne and Small World have both become staples in my collection. Carcassonne lit my intrest in boardgames years ago when I first got it (I think it was around 2009) and Small World is still popular in my groups despite it being in my collection since its release.
Does **Biblios** count? It offers deeper gameplay than **For sale** and very unique and streamlined mechanics

Always glad to introduce it to new players
**Survive** still comes out regularly (especially during the holidays) it's been on my shelf for a long time (the game itself is slightly older than me!)

**Citadels** one of the first modern board games I purchased and is still a great game, very excited for the new edition.
There are a lot of youngsters on here.

While I have replaced the elements twice since 89, *Empire Builder* is still a regular here. My wife and I will play it as a two-player game and be within a few dollars of eachother in the last turn regularly. Also good for new gamers, simple rules, boatloads (trainloads?) of tactical thought. Fun game.
**Zombicide**. It was an early favorite in my group and even as we have grown and expanded our interests in the hobby, this dice chucking, mini filled spectacle always manages to return to the table.
It has to be  **7 Wonders** for our group. While it's not technically on *my* shelf anymore (I replaced it with Among the Stars), I donated it to a member of my gaming group who loves it, and it still comes out regularly. It's most likely to be played if we have a large group, or are at the end of a night and wanting to wind down.

Most often played with the **Leaders** expansion. I tend to be an advocate of "too many expansions spoil what is great about the game" so it's usually that or **Cities**. **Babel** has yet to be purchased, and I would be surprised if the person who owns the game now will pick it up.
That would be **Catan**. Still the game that i played the most and over the longest amount of time. We even had a weekly meet up just to play the game. We were a little obsessed :D
Been in the hobby less than two years, but games I've owned for a while that still get played fairly regularly are Keyflower, Hive/Hive Pocket, and Castles of Mad King Ludwig. Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride as well, but that's largely dependent on who I'm playing with.
I think Pandemic has definitely gotten the most plays out of any game I own. Basically everyone I teach it to wants to play it at least once whenever we play games. 
The first modern board game I bought was **Carcassonne**, which I still play at least once a month.

The oldest of my highest-rated games is **Roll for the Galaxy**.  I have had it for about 18 months.  It was my most-played game last year and will likely be my most played this year too (it has twice the plays of most others).
Escape From Atlantis. I picked it up for cheap at a comic Fair, battered box and all (original, not the re-release). It just keeps coming out. Grandparents and chillens alike love it. I'm getting a bit bitter that the £5 bargain gets more plays than the more expensive ones (mice and mystics died in the water). 
**Hive**, **Zendo** and surprisingly enough the very light-weight **Spot It!**
First game that I've bought and played, **Battlestar Galactica** still see plays. It conveys the tense feeling of the show so well.


It's the best hidden traitor game ever made
The game ive had longest (without loosing) is Robo Rally, 1st edition. I loved this game so much before the modern wave of board games kicked in. I remember making a drinking game out of it and pkaying on NYE 99. But it comes out pretty rarely now.

The oldest still loved game is Carcassonne. It cones out more consistently then any other game i own and is the easiest to teach.i love the expansions, but rarely use them because im frequently playing with atleast beginner.

Edit. Formatting 
I've played both my favorite games over 50 or 60 times (**The Great Zimbabwe** and **Age of Steam**), other evergreens: **Hanabi Deluxe** (70+), **Diamant** (can play with kids as young as 5/6), **Dixit Odyssey**, **Peloponnes**, **Power Grid**, and **Splendor**. 
Regarding ratings and hype at the end of the day it's your own thoughts that really matter.  It's the same for when you check out video game, movie, and other forms of medias reviews and hype that follows along with it.  So as long as you know what you want in games and you know what to look for you can build your own hype, or you could simply ignore it.

But to refer games, we kind of need to know games that you've liked so far.  I could sit here and name games that are very far apart, but I have no idea if you'll actually enjoy them.  I'd hate to be that guy that recommends games that just gather dust on your shelves.
Well, you seem set on Deck Builders for the time being. 

First and foremost, I'll just say right now that **Ticket to Ride** and **Pandemic** have a place in just about any collection. As for some of my favorites that scratch a different itch:

* **Alchemists** is my favorite game. It definitely is not for everyone, as it is a considerably heavier worker placement game than Lords of Waterdeep. But if you like doing logic puzzles, this is the game for you.

* **Seasons** is just a beautiful game. Card drafting and dice drafting, you'll be checking out the cards looking for killer combos in no time.

* **Five Tribes** is mancala on steroids... Really the best way to describe it.

* **Dead of Winter** is a great semi-cooperative game that actually gives the traitor actual choices without easily giving themselves away. Only zombie game I own, and I'm ok with that.

* **Level 7: Omega Protocol** is an awesome dungeon crawl. It would be a repeat theme for you (marines mowing down aliens), but it plays VERY different from Legendary

* **Tragedy Looper** is just a very different game. Combine Groundhogs Day with Quantum Leap. It's another 1 vs. all game that is tough to get to the table at first. Once you get a solid group of 4 though, it's a great time. The first few loops, the heroes are trying to deduce what the scenario is and who the key players are. Once they figure out most of the info, it becomes a chess match, trying to outmaneuver the opposing side.

* **Specter Ops** is basically Metal Gear Solid in a box. Yet another 1 vs. all (sorry, 3 in a row), this one is all about the hidden movement and using special abilities at the right time.
 
About ratings: I somewhat agree with you, I think the average should be 5 and I often feel as people use 7 to represent average, but everyone do there own things I guess. The hype can get kind of high, especially on unproven kickstarter games, but because of this we have seen a lot of awesome games that would never have seen the light of day if crowdsourcing was not available. 


As for games, I suggest that you try a lot of different types of games before you start spending to much money. Some games to try that I like: **Ticket to Ride** a light game that can be a really good gateway game, **Hansa Teutonica** this has a bit more to do and think about (one of my favourites), **Chicago Express** a lighter economic stock holding game, **Antike II** nice and simple 4x game, **Arkwright** heavy economic game, **1830: Railways & Robber Barons** heavy economic stock manipulation game, **Through the Ages: A new Story of Civilization** heavy 4x game without a map. 
> Right as for the WSIG part, I have Codenames, LE: Alien (favourite game so far), Star Realms, lords of deepwater and Ascenion.  To start my collection I want to have a large variety of games to play (mechanically and thematically) so can anyone suggest games that are as far away from those listed above as possible?

Most of us would suggest 110% that this is a terrible idea.  Buying a huge variety of games right away into the hobby is how many people end up investing hundreds of dollars early into the hobby and finding out later that they hate worker placement games, or they hate games that take longer than 2 hours, or any other number of qualifications.  We regularly give the same advice to newbies:

**Go out, and play games and find out what you like.**  Go to meetups and be willing to play anything.  Go demo games at your FLGS.  Watch videos about games or mechanics that interest you and see if you can try before you buy.  Keep track of the games that you like, the games that you hate, and the games that are just ok.  Think about why you like the games that you like.

Secondly, please [follow the advice in the wiki about WSIG posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig)  

We have no hope of suggesting games for you to purchase just based on a list of five games.  How many people do you play with?  What's your favorite game?  What do you like about the games you own?  What don't you like?  Are you willing to play any theme / does the game need to have an intense theme?  By just saying "WSIG that's not any of these five games" people are going to suggest their favorite random game most likely and not give anything that has substance.  If you only play games with your girlfriend, 2 player games are different than 4 player games.  If you mostly play with a group of 5 people, that limits which games would be suggested.  

> Secondly, as this is clearly a very positive community, this part makes sense, but you guys need a filter haha. What I mean by this is that hype can kinda get outta hand, i get it you like this game but not every game you play can be 7/10 or better, i think perhaps we could all start thinking about flaws in games we love and thinking of a more balanced opinion, again I don't want to kill enthusiasm but understanding why a game I love might, in a fairer light, be a 6/10 helps let you give reccomendations while address potential issues. I also understand that with the variety of games out there it's hard to look at games in a somewhat objective light, but I haven't seen anyone here give a game less than a 5/4 and 7 is average.

You realize that people generally only suggest games that they *(gasp)* really think are swell?  Games that people suggest are, in general, going to have a semi decent rating because nobody goes out and suggests a game that they don't like, unless it's a specific need (I don't love Splendor because it doesn't fit with *my tastes* but this doesn't mean that it's a bad game.

What ratings are you complaining about?  Do you mean in the top ten list in the sidebar?  Do you mean on BGG?  

The top ten list in the sidebar are the games that this subreddit rates the most highly on BGG.  THe highest game on the top ten list is an 8.7, which does not suggest that we're rating games at an average of a 7.  In addition, when it comes to games that I rate for my personal collection, I'm more likely to be rating games that I like, because at this point I generally know what types of games that I like.  I knew that I'd enjoy Scythe before I played it because I love area control games and I love engine building, race type games like Istanbul.

If you're talking BGG....
I'm looking at my account right now.  Of the 75 games I have rated at the current moment, 27 of them are a 6 or lower.  Again, at this point, the longer I'm in the hobby I expect to have less and less low scores - not because there aren't games that are bad (I have games that are rated as 2s and lower) but because there's not enough time or money in the world for me to play every game and I'd rather prioritize playing games that I know that I'll love.

In addition, ratings on BGG actually mean something beyond "a seven is better than a six."

> 10 - Outstanding. Always want to play, expect this will never change.

> 9 - Excellent. Always want to play.

> 8 - Very good. Like to play, will probably suggest it, will never turn it down.

> 7 - Good. Usually willing to play.

> 6 - Fair. Some fun or challenge at least, will play occasionally if in the right mood.

> 5 - Average. No significant appeal, take it or leave it.

> 4 - Below average. Slightly boring, could be talked into it on occasion.

> 3 - Poor. Likely won't play this again although could be convinced.

> 2 - Very poor. Annoying, I plan to never play this again.

> 1 - Defies description of a game. You won't catch me dead playing this. Clearly broken.

**Edit: Sorry if I sound like a grumpy jerk.  But my biggest pet peeve is people who treat other people like their opinion is wrong.  All opinions are subjective, and other than games that are inherently broken, there's no wrong opinion when it comes to what games you like.  If someone thinks that Race for the Galaxy is the greatest thing since sliced bread and I would rather take a nap than play it, neither of our opinions are wrong.  People value different things in games and that's ok.  That's why we learn to express what we like and don't like in games - so that we can target games that we will enjoy.**
Funny story: This apparently got a lot of play at BGG.con Spring and has become a thing that people seek out and play at BGG cons.  I'm the reason that this is in the BGG library. I brought it to the convention to sell in the flea market in 2010 or 2011.  When it didn't sell and looked like it was going to be a perennial clunker, I just discreetly filed it away in the library.  The convention committee found it the next year when inventorying and added a barcode to it to check out.  

I'm not sure how it became a thing that people play, but I was really surprised to see it on the hot list screen at BGG.con 2015.
Strange enough my Grandmother just gave me a copy of this game last weekend. Hadn't even heard if the game prior.
Here you can watch the author of The Fault in our Stars drunkenly play the game.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVID3jgBrGY
"I can't believe it; I'm talking to a rug"
Why is this suddenly a thing?  This was on the Top 10 list for BGG Con
Funny review concept. Poorly written, though.

Clip from Lady Vengeance  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOhVQYkNxw

Great movie!  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451094/  

Third part of the Vengeance Trilogy.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vengeance_Trilogy

Sorry comment is off topic but I just got excited seeing a clip from the movie.
I'm scared to watch the real clip of the movie. But I need to know... Why do they all go nuts and start crying?
Items in the game that give straight-up points - animals, occupations, boats, Thing penalties, etc. - indicate the points with a shield icon.  The numbers on blue tiles don't have a different icon (and are in a different typeface) because they serve a different purpose.
yeah it's right. says it right there in the rules at the end what you score points for. The blue tiles are just better because you can place them next to each other.

2 numbers on the treasure blue tiles are sword value - cost for pillaging/raiding and money value - cost for buying using buying action space. 1 number on blue tiles is for sword value for raiding/pillaging.

a lot of people assume you get points for the blue and treasure tiles. just have to say at the start that this is not the case and it's all good.
I've now played a good handful of games, with scores ranging from 6 (yeah, you read that right) up to 130... both solo and multiplayer. The key scoring in the game is always getting rid of those negative point values on your home board and any exploration or house/shed boards you may have picked up. Those can add up fast. You don't need to cover them ALL, but you need to do your best... and that's what green and blue tiles are all about. In some cases, red and orange tiles can be used, but blue is always the most valuable type of tile, because it's always the most flexible for covering these negatives. 

Otherwise, yeah - no value to the tiles themselves in terms of scoring.
I've had the opposite experience -- it's played more than ever at my game group.  I've played it personally 6 times, and it's still as excellent as it was the first (except, you know, the surprise of how awesome it was going to be).  The group as a whole has played it probably an additional 8-10 times, and everyone is still interested.

Doesn't sound like a lot, but for the most part, that group plays stuff 2-3 times and then it falls to the side for whatever is new. 8-10 plays is HUGE.
I've played it for an entire night with a group of 8, all new to the game. A couple of observations:

* The first two games, we were not adhering to the double check rule very strictly. The captain has to announce his order, then the first mate and the engineer have to confirm. This *should* have lead to a rhythm of "GO NORTH" "CHECK" "CHECK", "GO WEST" "CHECK" "CHECK". In reality, everyone was very eager to go as fast as possible, new orders were shouted before the last ones were confirmed, and the radio operators were lost after three commands. "Did he get a double verification on that last one?", "Was that a real move or did you just change it before the engineer verified it?", etc. 
* Also, the other roles were shouting and loudly announcing everything they were thinking. This didn't help for clarity either. Sure, you can have loads of fun shouting and jostling at each other, but if you want to play the game, it's no fun if the radio operator is in the dark for 80% of the time because of radio interference.
* Therefore, we took a time-out and rechecked the rules. We took to heart the clear order structure, and besides orders from First Mate and Captain and confirmations from First Mate and Engineer, there was to be whispered instead of talked at normal volume. This greatly improved the quality of the games for the rest of the evening.
* Also, surfacing or stop means PENCILS DOWN (and hands clear from the board too!)
* Once you establish this chain of command and procedure, the "lame" role of First Mate (just cross off stuff and announce ready) becomes much more interesting and important. If you can't speak out loud all the time, the First Mate is (also because of the seating arrangement) the connector between the systems and the captain. The role allows for looking at the captains sheet for possible weapon use and at the engineers sheet for advice to repair certain systems, and good captains and engineers trust their first mates.
* The radio operator has the most straightforward role (just listen and take note, and inform the captain everynow and then)
* I found the role of captain much more complex than I thought at first. You have to order weapons to be ready on time, but only after you have an idea of where your enemy is and you need to rely on your First Mate and engineer to keep systems up and running. Sometimes, you can't do much about a situation, and sometimes you have to do everything at once. Luckily, stop and surface allows for a breather.
* As I said, the first mate is an interesting role, and slightly less stressful than being captain. Basically, the first mate is the communicator. Ask the captain what he needs next and manage it with the engineer.
* The engineer has the puzzlers role. It's a real challenge to use the erase damage system the best you can. You constantly have to update the first mate on the status of different systems, and what would be a good direction to go next.

I'd love to play it again, but only with a group willing to understand the importance of rules that are essential to the gameplay.

I learned i don't have six friends. I thought i did but i guess i don't.
I think it's excellent. It's unlike anything in my collection and is definitely playable in the 6-8 player range, so don't think you ***have*** to have 8 to make it shine. I've played it with non-gamers and it's devolved into a loud, chaotic, crapshoot, but with gamers it's a slower, more tense, tactical affair that's great. 
I've found that experience-imbalance can be really impacting in the game and affect the fun level. 

But I'm still enjoying it.
Much like any game if you play it a million times you'll likely get sick of it. But you can't really argue it wasn't a good game or you didn't have fun if you played it a million times. Personally, I haven't played it in over a month and a half but I think we are just trying not to play it too often. Plus you really need 6-8 people to play it properly which is sometimes hard to get at the table. 
I find it odd that you are self conscious about playing this game in a convention setting.  In my experience loud, involved games as usually the ones that attract interest and more people to play in those settings.  Everyone wants to see what's going on
Played it as 1v1 and 2v2 both as alternating turns. Every play was a tense,  fun experience.  No ragrets. 
I've found the game to be quite good.  During Extra-Life,  I had the opportunity to play it with 8 as a real-time game, and 1v1 as a turn-based game.  Both ways, I found it to be great.  The level of tension with trying to work together as a team and better than the other team is just fantastic.  Quite satisfying to let fly a torpedo and land that direct hit, because to get to that point you had to work as a team and make sure that you systems were green, you were close enough, you know where they were, etc.  1v1 is also intense, as it's all up to you to just try and out-fox your opponent.  you have all the time you need to plan, and it's a good sort of terrifying to realize that your opponent could be right next to you and ready to fire.

It's a good game.
My love for it still hasn't sunk! Everytime this games surfaces it is like direct hit from a torpedo full of excitement. I will increase pressure on my friends to keep playing this!

^^I'll ^^let ^^myself ^^out.

But not before I tell you that, indeed, it might be more of a home-gaming group game, and I indeed lead in the game by mentioning that, while simple and lots of fun, it is a stressful game with lots of information going on. Hasn't lead to disappointment, but again, I only play with the same groups and never where other people are bothered.
This game was a hit with my group. It's not anyone's favorite game but it's a game we all love. It fills a very nice hole in our collection. It's refreshing to play once in awhile in between heavy euros.
My game group didn't really like it so I brought it to work. It's such a good team building game. We now play it every two fridays and everyone loves it.
Brought it into the office almost immediately after I bought it and we've played once a week for the past two months (full 8 player games). We switch up the teams and roles. It's still great. Don't forget to [turn on your sound effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFUcRu9UcAo) (we still do this every time)!

It's only made it back to the home table once, though, since the first week. I think this is mostly due to other games being more popular with the girlfriend.
My group LOVES it.  There is nothing better than hunting or being hunted by living opponents.  Way different than some made up stat or dice roll or card or mechanic.
Captain Sonar really stands out as a TEAM game - which sounds amazing. I just need to work out how many people I could get to play and enjoy and also how few would play and still enjoy it.

A game about systems and communication and organization sounds amazing fun to me. Of course I read these sorts of reports to learn the contexts where it can shine, merely work or else fall short.
I'm still loving it, but maybe it's because it's so hard for me to get to that table.
Love it!! But, I could see how playing it in a public place would be awkward or uncomfortable... It's a party game that forces you to think, so it's found a solid niche in my collection. Hard to check both those boxes, but Captain SONAR does so very well.
I like it, but i see myself becoming attached to certain rolls.

Also, we just had 2 games of this going on in the same room and there was talk of finding a way to 4-team it. We figured the radio operators just needed different color markers.
I've played with 3 different groups and I have not heard an open dislike for it, so that has to count for something. I have heard several:"I didn't think I was going to like this but its _____(complimentary phrase here)."

I wish I got to play it more but often it's hard to get 8 available to play at the same time even at large gatherings because if people are already broken into groups from a previous game, all groups end at different times and usually start something else. 

People in my meetups actively ask for me to bring it, even though it doesn't always get played.
I feel the exact opposite, I've played roughly 5+ times now and the last time I played it was by far the most intense considering it was well over a 30 minute long game with one 10 minute section of it being a crazy dog fight in a single section with us shooting back and forth and somehow missing while dodging mines at the same time.

It's gotten to the point where people at my meetup group kind of want to do a weekly tournament/season of games with teams.
I was afraid of the novelty wearing off. The longer I wait to buy it, the more I find myself realizing there are other games I'd sooner buy. Will probably get it eventually, though, since my gf's hype-o-meter hasn't budged an inch since she'd heard of it.
I had a lot of fun playing it at a local convention, but it does seem like it has a very narrow audience. 
I've played Captain Sonar 10 times now, and I find it falls into a pretty predictable rhythm. (One of the captains recorded several "moving patterns" that maximize the engineer's efficiency and passed these around to other captains.) There's still a lot of fun in playing, but for me, it's a game I'll play but not suggest.
Absolutely loathed and despised by much of my group, more than any game ever created.

I sort of liked it, but it's the only game in our group that anyone has quit mid-game from hating it, and it was at the demand of multiple players.

Basically, two or three people absolutely couldn't stand the chaos of the game and the possible mistakes that came from playing in real time. People kept screaming that we must have made a mistake because that torpedo should have been a hit, god dammit. (They may have forgotten our team's silence moves). They were also very frustrated at trying to hear the moves as they were being called out - our captain's orders (me) and the back and forth between their captain and their engineer about what they could do.

It was even more striking because the two folks who insisted on quitting would usually play anything from tic tac toe to mega civilization and love whatever was played.

The real time chaos, possible mistakes and imprecision just don't work for some groups, I can attest.
To me it looks like one of those games that I really like, but will probably never play. It sounds so cool, but I just can't see myself being very successful playing it (too much going on all at once). 
It's a great idea, and I don't think anyone I play with will ever play it.
I've [posted my thoughts before](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/52flp1/dead_last_and_captain_sonar_experiences/), which I maintain, personally.

> The role of the Captain is significant, but not the most difficult. The captain needs to be decisive and communicate well, but in my experience (and I've been Captain 3 times and engineer once) the best captains need to be just as good at listening as they are at dictating orders. Of the games that we won, we won both of them by getting a torpedo direct hit and the other team doing two damage to themselves. Captains should be careful about moving too much in a long line because eventually it will be easy to line up how you've moved around islands and then they can potentially get a direct hit.

> The Engineer and the radio operator are the two most difficult positions. The radio operator is all about listening. We intentionally played with the ability to, at any point, say "stop" for rules discussions and that at that point everyone would stop so that we could discuss rules. For the radio operator, we specifically told them that they need to SPEAK UP if they are having trouble hearing the opposing captain. If their face is down and they're projecting at the table/into the dividers, you HAVE TO communicate that or else you won't be able to ever find the opposing sub.

> There is an element of tension between the captain and the engineer. A bad engineer will do permanent damage or prevent weapons from being usable - a bad captain will do the same. Engineers need to be able to say "we cannot go north any more" before it's the last minute." Engineers need to communicate when it's time to surface. They need to be able to ask "which tool would you like ready to use" and "ok, well if you could go north and west that would help us a lot."

> The game plays MUCH faster than you expect. Four hit points is not a lot, especially since it's much easier to get a direct hit than you would expect. It takes about as long to teach the rules as it does to play the game. I think most games of Splendor take longer. Which is fine, I wouldn't want to play a single game of Captain Sonar for 3+ hours. I don't view Captain Sonar as a "main event" of a gaming evening. It's not quite filler for me, but it's close. I could play three hours of consecutive games of Avalon, I would only be willing to play, at max, three games in a row of Captain Sonar. The decisions just aren't that interesting for over and over play.

> That said, it's a good game. I wouldn't buy a copy myself since I already have access to one in my game group. It's not a must buy for me if I didn't have access to a copy, but it's worth having in your collection.

I think it's a great game for the right group, but it just doesn't really do it for me.  I'll play it on occasion.  I think I'm more likely to play it as a start to the night or an end to the night, not the main feature.  It ranks slightly above Splendor in my interest to play.
I'm glad I sold my copy that I got for $50 and sold it for $70 since it was out of stock at the time.
Oh geez, I hated it. It's headache in a box.
I thought it was unique, but I would never ask to play it. I just don't find the game to be strategically deep. The "draw" of the game is the novelty of it being real-time and trying to find the enemy. Both of these properties don't wow me. After one game, I was done.
For all they hype... I kinda hated it.  
The first mate doesn't honestly feel like they do much.  There's almost no reason the captian or engineer shouldn't have that role. 

And also while on paper it sounded in,  in practice...  Real time puzzle solving is so not my thing.  The radar operator has an interesting job,  but even if they find the ship,  the captian better hope he's able to then get there. (in our game,  it seemed every time the radar thought he was right,  they were on opposite sides of the map). 
I think playing as the Radio Operator is fantastic, one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. The other roles, though, feel like they only exist to make it into a proper game. Captain is obviously necessary, but the first mate and engineer are just doing busywork the whole game. Exactly one person in our group of 6 actually enjoyed it, everyone else found engineer exhausting and first mate boring. 

I think the RO role is going to be copied in a better game very soon, and I'd rather just play that.
I played it 3 times recently and I was pleased with the experience, but immediately took it off my wishlist. Aside from playing with different groups of friends, and taking different roles, I don't think the actual game has enough variability to make me want to play it more than a handful of times.
Hype has certainly died for the game. I was considering getting the game and it's now off the list.

Honorable mentions to Love Letter, Coloretto (the two best ~$10 games), and Loopin Louie (maybe not even a game but pure fun).
In no particular order:

* **Codenames**/**Codenames: Pictures** (20usd), solid party game, and works really well with just about everyone.

* **Celestia** (30 usd). Lovely push your luck filler game. Always makes me laugh while playing it, due to how you have to say whether you trust your fellow players or not.

* **Patchwork** (28 usd). Excellent 2 player abstract.

* **Hey! That's my fish** (20 usd) / **Battle Sheep** (28usd). Both are quick filler games, and somewhat similar, as they are both about claiming spaces in a board that gets harder to navigate as the game goes on.


* **The resistance**/**The resistance: Avalon** (20usd). Arguably the classic hidden traitor party game by now. Personally I'm a bit burned out on it, but it is worth mentioning. There are a ton of (also affordable) alternatives by now though. I'll just mention one: **One night ultimate werewolf** (17usd) for a really quick filler hidden traitor game.

I went by Amazon (non-discounted!) prices. You can likely find these games much cheaper elsewhere. Still, I wanted to go by "MSRP" to establish a baseline.

*Links are to BGG and prices are from Amazon*

[Mascarade](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/139030/mascarade)-($25.34) I prefer this social deduction game over Werewolf. You're not only trying to figure out who everyone else is, but who you are too! *Disclaimer: Can't really be played on a glass table. 

[7 Wonders](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders)-($22.39) One of the best drafting games there is, and its about city building! The theme, artwork, and mechanics all hit a perfect groove for me.

[Dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion)-($23.99) One of the best deck building games there is. There are so many expansions available you'll never get bored. It's simple to learn, and plays excellent with 2. 

[Viceroy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/157526/viceroy)-($23.86) A bluffing/bidding game where you hire advisors and build a pyramid with the cards. The trick is optimizing your pyramid and out-thinking the other players at the table since if 2 people bid on the same advisor, neither of you get it!

[Bang! The Dice Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143741/bang-dice-game)-($14.52) This is a hidden role and dice rolling game that uses the Yahtzee mechanic. It's my go to game when we want to sit around the table, have a few beers, shoot each other, and laugh.
**Sushi Go Party**, dollar for dollar, has more game in it than almost anything else in its price bracket. It's an easy pick for any group.

**Hoax** is a Coup killer. Anyone who enjoys bluffing games needs to give this one a shot. 

**6 Nimmt** is one of the cheapest games out there and it's a riot every time. Plus it plays up to 10 people and does it well.

**San Juan** is a personal favorite of mine. It's smart and deep while still being accessible. Highly recommended.

**The Game of 49** is an unorthodox pick but more than worthy of your attention. It's a light auction game that competes directly with the likes of For Sale and Biblios.
Biblios  
Citadels  
Love Letter  
Star Realms  
Morels
Some of my favorites, all under $30 on Amazon...**Dominion**, **7 Wonders:Duel**, **Imhotep**, **Patchwork**, **Sushi Go Party** 
* Valley of the Kings (I'd recommend starting with the original set or Afterlife)
* 7 Wonders Duel
* Patchwork
* Biblios
* Dixit (or maybe Codenames)
**Top Five Games I Actually Play Under $30.00**
*In no particular order*

* **The Game of Things** (Ranges from $5 - $50) - Great party game that plays like a more interactive Cards Against Humanity/Apples to Apples. Match up the responses to a player and have some laughs.
* **Epic** ($9.99) - A great magic-esque deck building and drafting game that has a lot of interesting mechanics that you don't see elsewhere. By the same teams that did Star Realms. 
* **One Night Ultimate Werewolf/Vampire/Alien/Resistance** ($15 - 30) - An amazing suite of games, I love these things so much. Quick to pick up and play, and has a free companion app that makes it more interactive (available for iOS and Android).
* **Pixel Tactics** ($13 - $30) - A really smart and deep tactical PvP pre-built card game that's played on a 3 x 3 grid. The game comes with many different game modes that include multiplayer and draft formats, along with *many* cheaper expansions to broaden the appeal of your decks. 

* **Sheriff of Nottingham** ($20) - An interactive and social based bartering game. That's marketing speak for "Lie to your friends and test your friendship!" Pass goods and contraband through a 'sheriff' that rotates every round to try and score as many points, and as much gold, as possible. Great for social groups who like to play against each other, rather than against the game. 
Going to just convert currencies to make it easier: 

**Best Games for Under £24.00!**

* **Jaipur** - £18.00 via Amazon UK - excellent 2 player game that runs quickly and has a nice amount of variation and depth.
* **Pandemic** - £22.50 via Amazon UK - we all know it and love it
* **Sushi Go Party!** - £19.08 via Amazon UK (Out of stock :( ) - I LOVE the base game and I feel like the spreads you can make with the different card options will make this a must buy.
* **Walk The Plank!** - £20.68 via Amazon UK - Super fun and incredibly silly.
* **Patchwork** - £19.49 via The Board Game Hut - Chilled 2 player game with low AP potential and colourful pieces. 
Codenames, Sushi Go Party, Onitama, Carcassonne, The Resistance: Avalon
All the lists are completely different of one another. We need a script to make some statistics on the board games that were recommended.
Arboretum

Hive Pocket

Onitama

The rose king

Codenames

Castles of burgundy
**Codenames**, easy. I've never found a game that scales so well across age, number of players, and "weight" (whether someone is a heavy gamer or a light gamer). 
Sorry, I couldn't keep mine to just 5. I narrowed it down to 7, though:

* **Alhambra** ($27.49 on CSI)
* **Carcassonne** ($23.99 on CSI)
* **Eminent Domain** ($26.49 on CSI)
* **Gravwell** ($23.99 on CSI)
* **Jaipur** ($21.29 on CSI)
* **Lords of Waterdeep** ($27.49 on CSI)
* **Ulm** ($26.49 on CSI)
A ton of great games under $30.00, especially if you shop around a bit and check for second hand a bit.

But for new games almost any party game you like is under that price and can be great:

**The resistance**, **One Night Werewolf** etc. 

Then lots of smaller games like **Patchwork**, **7 wonders:duel** and so on easily go under this too. 


**Onitama**

**The Duke**

**The Grizzeled**

**Gravwell**

**Raptor**


Thought I would add a few more to the list. These can all br enjoyed by 2 players and are all fast. These have been really good games for me and the lady.
* Patchwork
* 7 Wonders: Duel
* Castles of Burgundy
* Lords of Waterdeep
* 8 Minute Empire
This is a list of games that will appeal to just about every level of gamer. All are easy to explain and ones I would absolutely be willing to play at just about any time. 

- **Friday**: A really great one player adventure deck building game. I've logged more plays with this than most of my other games and it's like $15.
- **Patchwork**: My wife and I have played a lot of this since getting it earlier this year. Two player only competitive Tetris with a quilting theme? It works, is inexpensive and requires thoughtful decisions.
- **Dr. Eureka**: It's definitely labeled as a kids game, but this game is a blast for just about anyone. It's a speed logic game, so you and the other players are racing to arrange marbles in a beaker the fastest. It really shines at three players imo.
- **Skullking**: An easy to explain, unique trick taking game with a piratey theme. I've got the Granpa Beck Version. It's not as nice looking, but it's cheaper and plays about the same. Always a blast.
- **Codenames**: It was between this and **Spyfall**. This just appeals to so many people and can accommodate a larger number. I've never had a disappointing game or disappointing people that I've introduced it to.
Sorry no time for a list right now but I do want to point out there is a sale on Amazon for Legends of Andor ($26) almost 25% off MM / CSI prices. Great game. 
I suppose I'll chime in with my current picks.

* **Push It** Is my current casual dexterity pick.
* **Thunder & Lightning** Is my current 2 player casual card game pick. (Replaced Battle Line)
* **Blueprints** Is my casual drafting pick. (Replaced Sushi Go) 
* **Port Royal** Is my casual "push your luck" pick. 
* **Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** is my casual strategy pick. 
* **Valley of The Kings** is my casual deck builder pick.


1) Splendor (maybe just over $30)
2) Power Grid (maybe just over $30)
3) Love Letter
4) Citadels
5) Loot
6) Sequence
1. Bohanza - Planting beans sounds stupid but its actually pretty damn fun.

2. Coup - Great filler games while you wait for someone else to show or for something else to get set up.

3.  Codenames - Great game although you really have to switch up teams as we started using the same clues when we saw repeat patterns.

4. Resistance - another quick filler game if you have too many people for Coup.

5. Love Letters (any variant) - Why?  See Coup.

* Deep Space D-6
* Fuse

**Splendor** - Easy to teach. Easy to learn. Quick to play. Fun and strategic with just the right amount of take that when you want to throw it in. $24 on Amazon.

**Sughi Go!** or **Sushi Go Party!** - Get either one. Party has more sushi varieties. Quick and easy drafting game that is fun for people of all ages. $20 on Amazon.

**Small World** - Fun and quick moving area control game. Not quite as easy to teach. Probably 1 step above an entry level game. Takes some willingness to try to learn rules which is a deal breaker for many non-gamers. By seasoned gamer standards, not hard to learn. Currently $28 on Amazon, but is usually around $35. Must be a holiday sale.

**King of Tokyo** - Fun and thematic dice game. Pretty easy to learn. Playable with 2, best with at least 3. Currently $28 on Amazon, again this might be a holiday sale price or something.

**X-Wing Minatures** - High on the nerd scale. If you love Star Wars, I can't imagine not loving this game. *The Force Awakens* core set is $23 on Amazon. Playing with only the core set is certainly fun and entirely doable, but the plethora of expansions are undeniably addictive and will bring the cost up real fast.


Okay with currency conversion it makes it $40 for me in Aus. I looked over ozgameshop.com to check price and stock

1) **forbidden desert**  $37.99  
2) **codenames**    $27.99  
3) **the resistance** $26.99  
4) **7 wonders duel** $34.99  
5) **Bang! the dice game** $29.99

Honorable mention Pandemic $52.99
Most of these lists are based on amazon pricing and do not account for shipping expenses or require you to buy enough for free shipping. Here are my games that under $30 from a non price gouging FLGS. 

1. Carcassonne - This and dominion are still the best games in my opinion, super easy to play. $30 (sometimes $35, whearas a flop spinoff will get marked down usually to $25) 

2. Mottainai - A really heady but still quick card game. You are in charge of a kitschey tourist gift shop at a shinto temple in japan. Puerto rico meets Evolution. $15 for the small box version. 

3. Pandemic - The most influential co-operative game. $30.

4. The resistance - The original social deduction team game set in a 23rd century cyberpunk dystopia. Fixes the luck problems of Mafia derivs. $17

5. Valley of the kings - IMO this game is the best dominion-clone, it completely reverses the economy problems of baddominion types because only trashed cards score. It has also the hand-tactics of masterwork TCGs. Not as much strategy as dominion but genuinely tactical to a level not done in any other deck building game. - $15

in no order:
**Codenames** $10-20 one of the best games of all time
**One Night Ultimate Werewolf** $10-20 Distills the hidden role game into 10 minutes of frantic fun
**Super Rhino / Rhino Hero** $10-15 great for all ages and improves on Jenga for me.
**Survive** $25-30 Goes down well with ever group I've ever played with, a lot of fun.
**Monikers** Amazing party game, I always carry a pack of cards with me.
Forbidden Desert  
Sushi Go!  
Love Letter  
Exploding Kittens

Can anyone recommend me a cheap place to buy some of these games in Australia?
How do people get stuff so cheaply in the US? It's not even remotely comparable to here.
**F.U.S.E.**! Just $17 today on Amazon Prime. Real time co-op game that's frantic, puzzly madness.

1. Kittens In A Blender- Easy Filler, but so fun and bad. I played it with some veterinarians. They loved it.
2. Forbidden Desert- Definitely a fun co-op.
3. Compounded- I'm not a chemistry geek and I still loved this game.
4. Gloom- storytelling, you have to have a dark sense of humor too.
5. Nuts- Another fun filler. Again, you have to have a sense of humor.

Can you tell what my favorite purchase this year was? 

This game is amazing. If you like Sushi Go!, this is the same, but so much better! It plays up to 8 people (which, given the light ruleset and quick-paced drafting gameplay, is a huge improvement), and you can chose which cards to play with so each game is very different, and the variety ramps up to 1,000! Plus, it has an *adorable* board that has a modular "menu" so you never forget what cards are in the deck, and doubles as a score tracker, something that the second edition of Sushi Go! lacked.
I'm a big fan of Coup, it was featured on Table Top on YouTube, although they messed up a rule or two. It's simple and fun, especially when you call your friends dirty liars.  Approx $10-15
Men of Mayhem (Sons of Anarchy) Board Game. I firmly believe this game would have been a huge hit if it werent for the tv show ip. Seriously, its in my top five games and it is currently on sale for $14
I'd say Bring Your Own Book
I have this arriving today, I was already excited because I love the original game so much but now I am AMPED. Thanks for the great post!
Do you think it's worth it if you almost always play two player? I feel like a lot of the role cards are only useful if you have more players to be able to do a bigger variety of things.
I love Pandemic The Cure but the expansion is just too expensive for me. Too bad because I've read/heard very good comments on it. 
I am so eager for this, I love Pandemic, and I love custom dice, so The Cure always had a special place in my heart. The expansion looks amazing, mine finally shipped today so I'll have it by this weekend!
> The new roles are square cut. The original printing of The Cure are cut like ID badges.

Sigh. I really wish they'd kept up with the ID badges. From a design point of view, that was once of the coolest things I've seen in any board game.
I've played the base game a few times and ordered this expansion.  I found the base game to be harder to win than regular pandemic (and we play In the Lab with the purple disease).  I think we just haven't figured this one out yet.

It feels almost as brutal as Space Hulk: Death Angel.  3 biohazards ~= slay this space marine.
Ameritrash is typically described by theme over mechanics, often including elements of luck which allow for big swings and tense moments.

Euro style gaming is often described by very intentional mechanics which allow for strategic development that isn't dependent on potential fortune.
Don't get too caught up in the distinction, though. Many games coming out now are considered hybrids, incorporating both euro and thematic-American elements. Additionally, there are many games that come from Europe (such as Italy and France) that don't follow the German design model, which is where the 'euro' concept mostly originated.

You'll also probably find that your tastes will fluctuate and change over time. So don't chain yourself to an ultimately meaningless dichotomy. 
Caveat: Everyone has their own definitions of Ameritrash and Eurogame.

Further caveat: The distinctions are blurrier than they were ten years ago, and there are plenty of games that are explicitly hybrids of the two schools of thought.

My personal favorite distinction is that Ameritrash games are about direct conflict (i.e. fighting) and Eurogames are about indirect conflict (i.e. economics). If my guy can attack your guy, that's Ameritrash. If we're competing over a shared pool of resources, that's Euro.

One of the classic distinctions is that Ameritrash games put the theme first (leading to exciting dungeon crawls with lots of fiddly rules so your character shoots arrows and walks through doors realistically) and Eurogames put mechanics first (leading to clean, simple rulesets about very boring subjects like cloth trading where the rules don't always make thematic sense). I don't personally think this one is all that important anymore because the two camps have learned from each other. Ameritrash designers have learned how to streamline, and Eurogame designers have learned how to evoke theme. There are still games at both extremes of the spectrum, but more and more games are inhabiting the blurry middle ground.

Another classic distinction is that Ameritrash games incorporate lots of randomness and Eurogames incorporate very little. Again, I think the two camps have learned from each other. Ameritrash designers have learned about meaningful decision-making outside of dice, and Euro designers have learned that randomizers can mix a game up without ruining its strategic value.
We actually call them Eurorubbish now to even the playing field. 
Just a little word of thought; I quite like [Quinns' decision to call it 'American-style', 'pulp', or 'thematic'](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/192rdl/should_i_use_the_term_ameritrash_in_my_commercial/). There's a lot going on in those comments, and it can be odd for an outsider to learn that 'Ameritrash' is an affectionate term.
Let's just end the debate. Call them Amer and Euro. Both 4 letter words like code for categories.
I'm always amazed that the community has continued the use of "Ameritrash".  It's quite pejorative.
Another distinction is interaction. American games tend to allow players to really mess with other people's stuff whereas Euros have indirect interaction such as taking the last cow at the store.
my oversimplification


Ameritrash = randomness


Euro = deliberateness
None. These are terms some people use to make other people feel like shit about the games they enjoy playing.

They ought to be avoided.
I played it last weekend and thought it was awesome, I'm going to have to buy a copy very soon.
I'm tempted to get the game, but I've heard the animals you build with traits don't feel like animals since it's just a board that represents pop and size. Also is the game luck based? Since your play depend on what cards you have in your hand?
I played it with my wife and absolutely destroyed her, which was weird because she usually kicks my butt in everything else.  She said it was due to the overwhelming number of choices she had each turn, and it was hard for her to decide on a strategy.  I just let the cards I drew determine my strategy.  Also, she didn't make any carnivores so every turn I was eating one of her species to death and she had nothing to counter it.  

I absolutely loved it.  It's true, the animal has to kind of exist in your mind because it is merely a board and a few cards but I'm a roleplayer so that comes naturally to me.  I had the cooperation trait on one of my species so it was fun to imagine how the two worked together to get food.  My carnivores were intelligent pack hunters, which I found to be a deadly combo (not unlike in real nature!)

It's a wonderful game and a great conceptual tool for teaching evolution.  Certain environmental pressures killing off your species?  Evolve to adapt to them.  But then things might change in a new direction and your previous adaptation is no longer useful and possibly even harmful.  Get too big and consume too many resources and you'll face a die-back.  

It's a wonderful game.  I just hope my wife will want to play it again.
I've only played my copy once, and only with 2 players, but it was still a blast. Base Evolution was one of my favorite games and Climate just sweetened the pot with very little new rule complexity.

I love migratory, it's so powerful. In our game we had multiple desertification events within a few turns of each other, so food ran out fast. I had several species suffer big losses, but my spouse had 3 different migratory species! I should've went carnivore when I had the chance...
I already had the base game (2nd Edition) and Flight, so I opted for the conversion kit, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about.

First things first, I really like Evolution, and even though I've only played it a couple times, I really like the Flight expansion as well. I'm somewhat disappointed that Flight isn't compatible with Climate, but I understand the concerns about bloat that led to North Star deciding they should be incompatible.

Can anyone that bought the stand-alone version of Climate tell me what comes in the box (I had a hard time determining that when I chose between the conversion kit and the standalone)? I get the impression that they might actually result in significantly different gameplay experiences.

In the conversion kit, you get the board, the 30 climate event cards, 42 new trait cards (7 each of the 6 new traits), modified versions of the 4 old trait cards with Climate changes (Ambush, Burrowing, Carnivore, Defensive Herding), and the little wooden climate marker.

It seems strange to me is that only the new Climate-only cards, and the modified-for-climate cards have Climate climate influencing effects. Is this true of the stand-alone as well? It seems way too easy for people to get a hand full of cards that give them no control whatsoever over the deadly climate effects that could wipe out their creatures. Do all the cards in the stand-alone version have Sun/Snowflake icons, or is it the same as in the Conversion Kit?

Also, the first thing that really jumped out and bugged me while playing Climate (other than the above, and the misprint in the player aid that makes Migratory "*way* better) was the fact that Body Fat has no interaction with Climate whatsoever. This seems like a complete oversight to me, when all you have to think of is just about any cold-region dwelling creature to observe them packing on weight to survive the cold, while the only species that really screams "defensive herding to survive the cold" to me are Penguins.

Anyway, still love Evolution as a game. But **TL;DR** I feel like I made a mistake with the conversion kit, and hopefully someone with the stand-alone version can confirm or deny that feeling.
I cancelled my pledge because I was worried the climate stuff would make the game really swingy. Anyone have thoughts on that?  I really like the base game. 
I have played Agricola over 450 times, 99.9% the original Z-Man edition.

The new edition of Agricola from Mayfair is *really* well done.  Standardizing the wording on the cards, the inclusion of all the shaped pieces are all a plus.  The reduction in player count is not a big deal, but the reduction in price is!

I have the 5-6 player expansion(Essen purchase) and some of the cards in it are quite good! So I would say that the new Agricola is definitely worth it.
I had never played Agricola before and I am very happy with Mayfaire edition. I know that the previous editions have tokens to represent animals and crops and the Mayfaire edition has wooden animeeples. They are a really nice touch to the game. I don't think I would ever want to play a 5 player game of Agricola so Mayfaire worked out well.
I have never played it at 5 and probably never will. I never use the Family side of the board. I have had the Z-man version for years and haven't looked into the mayfair version in detail but if all that is missing is the family edition and 5th player I say go for the cheaper game.
The Mayfair family edition is a different game from the Z-Man family edition! The Z-Man family edition mostly just subtracts the cards, whereas the Mayfair family edition has a new board and an entirely different (simplified) scoring system. So whereas it was easy to "graduate" from the Z-Man family edition and step up into regular Agricola, I don't know if it's quite the same for the new family edition.
From my research the Mayfair edition has better cards because they revised them so that version will be preferred now. However, people also recommended me to wait for the all in 1 Mayfair edition coming some time next year that will have added card packs and the 5,6 player additions. 
You've gotten a lot of responses here but the main thing no one is mentioning is that there is a variant suggested in the rules for the revised edition to remove the occupation and minor improvement cards. This is essentially what the family edition of the z man version did to help teach the game. The revised edition more or less covers all of the same bases as the old version, I'd definitely suggest getting it as it's cheaper and you've said you don't plan to play with more than 4 typically.
Normally I'd say, save your money.
But in this case we've played the Z-man version over a hundred times and almost all of that has been using the family version.  Our perception (rightly or wrongly) is that the card-version can be unbalanced and is one more barrier to getting nubes up to speed.
Plus, you never know when that 5th person may want to give it a try!  We really enjoy it as a five player game.  Changes dynamics quite a bit.

Super experienced Gric player here. Got to play the new version multiple times at Gen Con. It's a bit less of a challenge (experienced players can exploit a couple cards,) but still very much captures the spirit of the OG Agricola.

Unless you want a super-mentally-stimulating game or plan on playing over 5 times a year (not enough cards to support a ton of replay,) very safe to get the new version.

Don't play the basic game :) Playing occupations and minor improvements is an enormous part of the game's richness.
I don't get the appeal of the family side. Played with some friends, who I'd only played Lords of Waterdeep with before, and they were fine with cards.
One thing I will say is that the card stock of the new version is much thinner than the Z-man. It's only noticeable if your riffle shuffle, but it is noticeable. On the other hand the cards seem more focused with the removal of some of the less useful cards. 
My friends and i dont play the family edition either and the game may be too "heavy" for kids, even with the family version, I go for the less costly version too, especially if the cards are improved.
Never played revised edition.

Z-man edition's family game I find essential to teaching new players the game as well as just the only level some people enjoy the game at. The cards are really nice to add replay value to the game if you're playing it a bunch of times in a short time frame. But, even with experience players, we seem to always gravitate back to the family version for infrequent plays of the game. I think for a once-off play of the game, the cards offer too many choices and without having played the game once, you simply don't have a great grasp of what cards are powerful and what cards aren't. (so if you're me having played it a bunch, an already high skill game becomes even easier to win when you understand what cards to use and your opponents are clueless which isn't desireable)

So personally... I'll never buy the revised edition. Losing the family game doesn't seem worth it for the variety of gamers I play with.
Cool thing you have going. I wasn't able to back Ahead in the Clouds but I just may grab it for this. Thanks for giving something back this time of year!
My choices are typically playing a gateway game or not playing a game at all.
The games I would play are based on the company around me.

I would gladly play a gateway game if that was what kind of players I had around me or if my mental acuity was already drained. Sometimes you need to have a relaxing gaming experience and not always tax your brain playing heavier games.
Good games aren't relegated to a certain weight or complexity or time investment. Gateway games are enjoyable. Some offer more returns than others and those don't make it into my collection but the ones that i think have legs get played as much or more than others in my collection.
Yes, absolutely. I have two **Ticket to Ride** games, **Carcassonne** and **Catan** still on my shelf for that very reason. Sometimes I just get an itch. My taste has refined over the years but that doesn't change the fact that they're great games. I still get a lot of enjoyment out of them.

By contrast, I have *zero* interest in playing **Scythe.** 
Honestly I prefer gateway games in general even as I've gotten more into the hobby. Of the heavier games that I've tried I'm not convinced that many of them really add much in the way of strategic depth, usually it's just repetition and bookkeeping. Even if a gateway game does lack a bit in long term strategic depth I often would rather explore that depth and then sell the game and try a new one versus getting into some really super complex game. I tend to really value a tight and clear rule set and games that can't be quickly and easily explained and grasped by someone who boardgames at least casually I'm not interested in nine times out of ten.
Yeah all the time. I still love look at me and the others players creations in Castle of Mad Kingd Ludwig, stombing trough the lands with my pillaging orcs in small world or insiting other players calls the black cubes in Waterdeep for rogues.  Smash Up have been one of my favorit games since i got it and i don't see that changing anytime soon.
  
I keep them because i think they are good games, and i like to have a tons of options for games to play with friends and families instead of just big hulking boxes of strategies. To be honest i think this is a sort of wierd question since i don't see anything that should suggest Scythe and co. as a ''objectively better'' game.  
  
On a slightly unrelated note: I really dislike the term ''gateway games'. I don't get the need of the word. Everyone i know i fully capable of learning any game and i think most people would be offended if i someone wanted to try Scythe and i went ''oh you a not ready for that. Here lets play Ticket to Ride so you can learn about the concept of area control''.
I haven't been into this hobby for very long yet, but I don't get the feeling that I'll stop enjoying lighter, gateway style games. I have always had a problem of liking too many things and not having enough time to explore them all, but light to medium weight board games are a great outlet for that.

With that said, I'm really looking forward to the day that I can sit down with a group of friends and play an epic game of TI3 or Through the Ages, but I think that there will always be room on my calendar and in my heart for games like Ticket to Ride, especially since those are the games that I'll actually be able to play with my family.
I play a lot of gateway games.

*  My wife doesn't like to learn new games and she "likes what she likes."

*  When I get to play with other people I am often introducing them to modern board games.

*  We have a three year old so setting aside the time and finding willing participants to play the heavier games I own is really difficult.
We still play most of the games we got when we first started out like: **Ticket to Ride**, **King of Tokyo**, **7 Wonders**, **Small World**, **Dominion**. Just the other day we played **Lords of Waterdeep** right after a heavy game of **A Feast for Odin** and loved every second of it.
Reading this and the comments just makes me realize how vastly different various definitions of "gateway game" are.
Yes, and actually I don't like the "gateway" term because it implies those have are only good to get into the hobby, and you need to move on to something else later.

TTR, Catan or similar games are great because you can teach it to friends, they understand it and are able to enjoy it from the first game. You don't need to play a first 2 hours game before understanding the strategy needed to win.

Finally, I often play with young kids and for that you need simple games.
Also the rules are simple enough so you can teach them in 10 minutes.
I'll assume you mean beyond playing with family members or other "non-gamers".

Yeah, I have a hard time playing gateway-ish games with gamers. It kinda sucks because I'm not that into heavy games, so I'm usually the lightweight at the table. 

But as I do get to play **Tokaido** enough, I don't complain.
Sure, I have nothing inherently against gateway games, but for sure they are more likely to be boring to me. I would easily start up a game of **King of Tokyo**, a game of **Ticket to Ride**... I guess if that was the only option.


Really just fun things are still fun.
I think I tend to throw an expansion or two in when I'm playing so-called gateway games. I still love Carcassonne, but I like playing it with at least Inns & Catherdrals, Traders & Builders, and Abbey & Mayor. I'll play Ticket to Ride, but I prefer playing one of the expansion boards (I quite like Pennsylvania).

I don't think this has to do with weight or complexity as much as just the fact that I've just played a lot of those games.
I play lots of heavy games. I play lots of gateway games. I like playing games! 

On Saturday I played, Paris Connection, Mombasa, Jamaica, and Potion Explosion. On Thursday it was Lewis & Clark, TTR Nordic Countries and Biblios. Keeping variety alive! 
*Rant Mode On*

You are very dismissive of so called 'gateway games' but for some people games are an activity that are enjoyed with people rather than the activity. I play lighter games generally as they are easier to explain and play whilst still keeping the 'not Monopoly' vibe. I'm not always in the mood or have time for a 120 minute heavy worker placement...

*Rant Mode off*
Yep! I'll enjoy anything if the group is into it, up to the 2 hour mark.
I've played a lot of **Potion Explosion** lately and that's definitely a light-weight gateway game. Played **Betrayal** the other night and **Sushi Go** a lot even when it's just my fiancee and me who are fairly serious gamers. Sure there are games that I've lost enthusiasm for, but it isn't solely because of weight/complexity. There are a ton of different factors involved.
Yeah, I still play gateway games.  I'd say that gateway games take up most of my time playing games, actually.

But do I still "get the itch" to play them?  No, not really.  Like so many others, I'm still trying to find a group of folks interested in bigger games; but I have a current group that's open to trying lighter games.  I genuinely like the games and I'd probably develop an "itch" to play them if they weren't so frequently played already.  But as it is, I'm getting pretty tired of Catan and Sheriff of Nottingham while so many of my "deeper" games stay unplayed.

But I'll take easier games over no games, so I play.
We played Ticket to ride today for the first time in about 3 years and I had a great time.  It probably helped that I won by over 50 points.  :)
Rarely, but when I do I usually enjoy it.
It beats playing The Game of Life, so yes.
While *I* now prefer medium-weight or heavier games, almost all the people I play with prefer gateway-style games.  As such, I spend a lot more time playing those kinds of games than anything from my collection.  If I only wanted to play, say, **Tigris & Euphrates** or **Vinhos**, I would find myself rarely getting a game.
I'm not sure which exactly are gateway games, but I still love Codenames and Love Letter and Red Dragon Inn, and they probably are still in my top played games.
I pnay selective "gateway" games. I absolutely hate Catan, or Ticket to Ride, or Pandemic, but could gladly play Carcassonne.

While I do like some heavier games, I don't think they often warrant the complexity. These games might have a shit ton of components, and mechanisms, but lack the finesse and clarity. Deeper game with a solid streamlined options is the happy medium. 
All the time. We still play a lot of **Carcassonne**, **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Quadropolis**, **Guillotine**, **Gravwell**, **Tsuro of the Seas**, **Kingdom Builder**, **Lost Cities**, **Qwirkle**, **Splendor**, **Tokaido**, **Takenoko**... man, we've got a big list of "gateway" games we play all the time. We can't always be playing Lacerda games. :)
mmm rarely I'd say.  I usually get the choice of what we play and I know most medium-depth games I have well enough to be able to teach them with minimal issue
Sure. I'd happily play **Sheriff of Nottingham** one day and **Scythe** the next. 
Medium heavy is about as light as I go these days. My time is limited and.hesvy games are what bring me joy. I'm lucky enough to have friends that agree so that helps. 
I tend to mix it up.  I save the heavy games for solo play and more of the lighter games for my game group; we only play once a month, so we're still not doing the heavier stuff.  I'm not sure they'll every be into a 4-5 hour game though; and I'm ok with that.
It really depends on the group. My Monday night group wants to play heavy 4p stuff, but everyone else I game with is either flexible (will play any kind), or prefers light-middleweight games. 

I still play **Airlines Europe, 7 Wonders, Kingdom Builder, and Bohnanza**.
We haven't played a gateway in almost a year. The majority of what we play ranges from Madeira / Vinhos / Caylus to an 18XX. We gave away half of our gateways and only kept Dominion, Carcassonne, and a few others for nostalgia's sake.
There's a huge difference for me between "gateway" games where the best strategies quickly become obvious, and others where the rules are easy and actions are limited, but the strategy goes very, very deep. **King of Tokyo** is in the first category, a fun, light filler. **TTR** is in the second. You can always get better at reading an opponent and blocking, disguising your routes, endgame timing. **Thurn und Taxis**, **Small World**, **Waterdeep** are all *deceptively* simple games. They don't stay interesting *for* you, you *make* them interesting as you learn to think further ahead and appreciate subtler strategies.

I tend to mock/annoyingly bitch about this problem with the expression "24 bishops", as in: "Chess has gotten so boring now that we know how the pieces move and have experienced every kind of capture there is. I'm really looking forward to the 24 possible bishops expansion, where the pieces are different every time. That will bring endless replayability."
Only as time-fillers. 
Sure I do. Lords of Waterdeep is a great game but it's considered the entry worker placement title holder. Splendor see more play then it should. And I play the Patchwork app almost every day with my girlfriend. Jamaica isn't the deepest game but it's still fun and pretty to look at. 

I've since sold off a lot of the other gateway games likes Smash Up and CAH. They lost their luster quickly and made me wish I had tried to play more before I started purchasing. 

But I'm lucky and we've been playing netrunner pretty hard lately. 
Depends on mood, Karuba and Blue Moon City is very gateway-ish and they are here for good.
I very rarely play anything gateway, I have gotten rid of most of my gateway games as well. I will sometimes ski/ avoid game nights where there is more focus towards gateway games. When I know what crowd that is coming. 
Doesn't the choice of games depend on the guests that you have over? Catan can still be a great game, even when you enjoy Agricola, Scythe or Eclipse with other people.

I recently read a post that made a case against the term "gateway games", because that suggests you would rather be playing something else...
Heck yeah.

**Carcassonne** has hit my table just about once a week on average every week over the past 5 years. And it will continue to hit my table for the next 5, 10, 15, 50 years.

Some, of course, have drifted off. Five years ago, I was happy playing **Catan**. I'd rather never play that again though.
Yes. It helps that I have kids, but even the husband and I might play Splendor and then The Gallerist in one sitting. All games are... Fair game?

I don't even play them with new folks now. I think there are more complex games most intelligent adults learn fine as their first game.


I mean, you can play what you like. The other games aren't suddenly bad games if they don't match your taste anymore. You can always sell off games you're not into anymore and free that shelf space up. 

I personally still a lot of these games you seem to look down on. They are good for introducing others into board games, or just simple enough to play if you don't want to sit for hours on the table thinking about your choices. 
All of the time.  I run a Twitch stream and it really helps to play simple games on it, but even if I wasn't running that many of my favorite games are kind of gateway games.  Right off the top of my head I'd almost never refuse a game of **Secret Hitler**, **ONUW**, **Junk Art**, **Codenames**, and the list goes on
**Alchemists**

**Argent: The Consortium**

**Dungeon Petz**

**Dungeon Lords**
How heavy or accessible do they need to be?
**Lords of the Waterdeep** and **Legends of Andor** comes to mind as both are euro games.
+1 for **Lords of Waterdeep**. The theme doesn't really do much for the game itself, but it has a nice feel to it. I really enjoy it.
Sounds pretty interesting. You got the name wrong though btw.
I'd definitely like to see some gameplay
In terms of what I'd like to see more of in table top design would be real time games like **Captain Sonar**. I really enjoy the teamwork involved and it feels like there is so much more that can be done in that vain.

Something else I've enjoyed is the placement mechanic in **Orleans** and it seems like there should be more ways to use that. I'd love to see a lighter game that just focuses more closely on that mechanic.
Misleading box art? Which games are these now, I'm super curious!
Lotus is fantastic, and the reception to it (as far as I've seen) has been overwhelmingly positive. What do you all have coming down the pipe next? :)
Oh my gosh!  I demo'd Junk Art to you both at GenCon.  It wasn't until after the fact that I realized you were the Lotus designers.  Congrats on the success!  I really enjoy it and it's something the wife and daughter both like so double win!

I'm sure it's been asked elsewhere but what was the inspiration for Lotus?  Was the theme present throughout the design process?  

OP - please don't forget to update the past MOTW wiki page when you post these.
I would like all the painted minis for my completed 2nd edition....haha
Great job. I like your style. I've always found the more rough shading on miniatures appealing. Makes me want to go back and paint all my Descent minis.
Wow what brushes do you use?  I'm just getting into painting warhammer 40k figures and I'm finding it a paint o paint the small details.  

Any tips?

Figures look great btw. Envious of your skill.
Is that a Space Marine with a bolter?  I never knew they did that for Talisman! I bet he was even better than the Chaos Warrior!
On the weekend we introduced two new players to **Chicago Express**, they hated it. They couldn't wrap their heads around the fact they aren't the red player, or green player, but merely a part owner in a company with access to their profits. As 1/3 owner of red, I tanked the company pretty bad at key points and that thoroughly confused the other player. Why would a person who profits from the company doing well not choose the best option to maximize profits? Had to explain that I was trying to minimize the delta between us (we were 1 & 2 in terms of potential profits, along with holding the most cash as well). 

I understand how it's a different kind of thought process compared to most other games; one that takes getting used to. We're hoping to convert them because we'll have five for any 18xx games in the future.

I often see the same mistakes being made in **Age of Steam** when players fail to exclusively move goods over others tracks to minimize that players profits.
Ok, what is the easiest way to play 18xx online?    Preferably, I'd like to find a way to play without having to install any software.   Anything like boiteajeux or boardgamearena?

Short of this, it comes down to this:

I'm absolutely shocked that there isn't there an 18xx on iOS.   I'm very close to breaking down and writing one myself, however I don't want to go down that path if I get blocked by intellectual property rights.   Are there are any popular public domain or creative commons 18xx games?   Or, who would I have to request permission to write an iOS implementation of one (or many)?   I'm thinking pass-and-play as a minimum. 

I don't have much to say here... except to exclaim that I finally got my GMT printed copy of 1846! I'm one of you! Well... not quite yet. It's my very first 18xx game. I'm a bit afraid of opening it! It's still in shrink on my shelf. Problem is, I don't have 4+ players willing to get into this right now - so I don't want to get all excited for it. I'm glad to have a copy though, because when I do have a heavier games group, it'll be one of the first I crack out with them. 
I don't know if I've noticed that much kingmaking in my plays. Keeping in mind I'm often teaching new players or playing with relatively new players. There's plenty of temporary collusion including friendly track lays or combined efforts to float a new company. 
I quite like battle lines. 
The SO and I can usually work our way through **Hansa Teutonica** in about that time frame. You have similar tastes to us. Also, **Jaipur** or **Splendor**.
I think **Mottainai** would fit right into this series. (**Glory to Rome** if you can get it of course)
If you're okay with direct conflict games, then check out **Tash-Kalar**.  It's my personal favorite 2 player game.  Plays in 30-45 minutes.
**Targi** is a great choice, and 45 seems doable if you both know what you're doing. I wish I'd play it more.
There's like a billion 2 player games that are <45 minutes. Need more constraints.
Traders of Osaka (nee Traders of Carthage) is quite a nice faster playing game. It plays 2-4 and I find it best with 2 because each player added removes a lot of control of the game from each player, to the point that 4 player is too chaotic, IMO. Very nice for 2 and not bad at all for 3. Attractive artwork, nice theme, and some interesting mechanism.
Most competitive card games I've played take less than an hour. Netrunner, Game of Thrones LCG, Ashes all take in the 30-45 minute range.

I especially like Netrunner, for experienced players in tournament play, they are required to complete 2 games in an hour, and that goal is met 80-90% of the time. There will be a rather considerable learning curve for any of these games, but the replayability they offer is unmatched.
**Galaxy Trucker** is brilliant fun. It has just stolen the crown of "current favourite quicker game" for me from Star Realms. Others my SO and I play regularly in this slot are **Hanabi**, **Sushi Go**, **Flash Point**.
Bloodbow team manager
Völuspá. Maybe qwirkle if you don'tt want the tile powers (they're really fun though. 
[Here's a good geeklist](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/209290/recommended-2-player-games-game-length-above-30-an) that has plenty of suggestions.
Carcassonne: gold rush. Great with all player counts. Play it 2p with the wife often. Rewards skillful play but there's enough luck to shake your expectations.
**Splendor** is my go to in that time frame. 2 can also finish a **Ticket to Ride** (Especially if Nordic Countries) or **7 Wonders Duel** in that time. 
I would say... **7 Wonders**. There's a reason why this game is SO popular and liked.
* **Notre Dame** - Fast and smart Feld game with drafting and snowballing as central mechanisms. Getting a reprint this year.

* **Paperback** - Deckbuilding word game. Given what she likes, this is a sure-fire winner.

* **Splendor** - Short, thinky engine-builder. 
* **Patchwork**
* **7 Wonders: Duel**
* **Pandemic: The Cure**
You need **Arboretum** in your life. I kind of guffawed at this game assuming it to be some snobby tea and crumpets affair, likely to be as dry as chewing napkins. Nope! It's tense and thoughtful all the way through.

Good. Just so many kinds of good. 20/10 good. 
The Dice Tower did a video on this a little while ago, and there's probably some good relevant discussion on the thread about it. [Take a look.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4esnp7/dice_tower_top_10_games_that_scale_well/)

We're typically a 2-player party as well, with occasionally one to two more couples. We really enjoy:

* **Concordia** (specifically the Brittania/Germania expansion board)
* **Splendor**
* **Carcassonne**
* **Alhambra** (we ignore the "ghost 3rd player" rules)
* **Latice**
* **Dominion**
Knizia's **Samurai**

The board gets bigger with more players
Great question- looking forward to everyone's thoughts as this is my situation as well. :)
**Ghost Stories** is good if you want a co-op. It's significantly harder than pandemic though so expect to lose a lot, although it does have difficulty settings that you can adjust if you like.

**Seasons** is kind of similar to magic the gathering, but you also roll dice and select them for mana and actions and whatnot. You can play it on board game arena if you want to try before you buy.

**Catacombs** is a dexterity game where 1 player is the dungeon Master and 1-4 players are heroes fighting their way through the dungeon. You fight by actually flicking(or sometimes rolling) discs at each other's stuff. This might be hard to find now, but there are similar games like flick em up out there too that you might consider.

**Survive: Escape from Atlantis** is a game where you all have dudes on an island and you're trying to get them to safety, but you can go after other players with sharks and sea monsters and sometimes use special abilities. This game plays best at 2 or 4 imo. 3 is a little awkward but you can do it.

**Welcome to the Dungeon** is a great small game where players goad each other into entering a dungeon as they gradually add monsters to it and make the hero weaker. Eventually everyone except for one player taps out and the remaining player has to try to go through it. I prefer it at 3 or 4 because of the banter but it works well at 2 as well. Games last probably 10-15 minutes, but you can play multiple rounds.
For 2-4 players, I would recommend **Castles of Burgundy** and **Eight Minute Empire**. 8ME is kind of like... Risk-lite, but it's actually fun, actually strategic, and has low drama. There is also a lot you can do to control the depth of the game, so you can have quicker, lighter games with fewer complexities if you want. It also has the benefit of being small enough to play on a small fold out couch table.

However, don't be afraid to invest in some strictly two-player games, too. **7 Wonders Duel**, **Patchwork**, and **Lost Cities** all run $15-25 and are great, great two-player games.
Some of these games I played with 2 and/or 3 but never with 4 players:  
**Among the stars** - build your space station by drafting cards  
**Shakespeare** - every player runs a theater, hires actors and try to make best show (at least that's the theme). In reality there is blind bidding which determines number of actions for turn as well as players order, low scores, need to pay actors at the end or loose points, use characters on one turn but rest on other, etc. Really great game  
**Trajan** - I would say typical Feld's point salad game, one of my favorites. It feels like 5-6 little games put into one package.  
I would also suggest: **Biblios**, **Discoveries**, **Rokoko**, **Lords of the Waterdeep** (+exp), **Splendor**, **Istanbul**, **Concordia**
**Quantum** - good with 2, 3, or 4

The 2 player game is quite different from a 4 player game, but both very good experiences.
If you want something new/different and are open for a Cthulhu themed game, check out **Arkham Horror The Card Game**. You can see if you like it with the core set, which is quite cheap, and start expanding and playing the additional campaigns with expansions. It works perfectly with two players and is my current favourite story driven game for two players. It can be played with four players if you (or one of your friends) buy another core set.
I recommend **A Feast for Odin** - This is a game with a LOT of choices and paths that is pretty streamlined. Play well with 2-4, also has a solo variant that I have yet to try. But does have a large but modular foot print.

Another option is **Small World**, a fun fantasy light war game with no Dice. The board is tuned to the number of players so scales well. Despite the number of pieces, it doesn't take an excessive amount of space.

Last one I would recommend is **Race for the Galaxy** a great card game. Has a slight learning curve, but small footprint, not excessively long, and good replay-ability.


Broom Service
**Marvel Legendary** Co-op deck builder so dominion with teamwork. I like it better with 2 people however the challenges that arise with 4 people make it "funner". 
**Myrmes** would be perfect. Nearly as difficult (in rules) as **Keyflower** but just as heavy in strategy and its interaction with the other players. 
**Legends of Andor**, but it isn't small footprint.
Roll for the Galaxy, Eight-Minute Empire: Legends, Viticulture, Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy, New Bedford, Lotus, Cosmic Run.

I'll also suggest you look at some 2-player-only games, like Patchwork, Jaipur, Mouse Guard: Swords & Strongholds, Thunder & Lightning, Tides of Madness/Tides of Time, Hive, Mr. Jack Pocket, etc.
If you're looking for a light eurogame, **Splendor** plays great with 2-4. My wife and I play frequently and have a good amount of fun with it. It's a casual game that plays quickly, so don't plan on spending the evening on that game alone.

**Codenames** is fun and uniquely different with 2,3 and 4 players. With 2, it's kind of like a coop effort to beat the AI (just covering up one card per turn). With 3, there's basically a  moderator with 2 players competing against each other. With 4 it's 2 teams competing against each other. Fun in any combination. Again, a light game.
I would say blood rage. Its even designed to add or take cards away for how many people play. I enjoy it. Easy to lead. Difficult to master.
Small world!
**Five Tribes** Scales great from 2-4 and the bidding mechanic really changes the aspect of the game at different player counts. 
You might check out **Indigo** as well as **Lanterns: The Harvest Festival and Cacao**.

I personally like **New York: 1901** as well. 
For something a little different but still very much tile laying have a look at Samurai.  It's an abstract game that's easy to play but has plenty of hidden depth similar to Carcassonne and has lots of direct player interaction.  The latest version of this game by FFG is just beautiful. 
You could look at maharani. You know her tastes better than me but it might work. You could also look at Völuspá or medina (wood not tiles but it feels like tile placement) 
I'll chime in late. 

My wife and I love tile games as well and are one of our favorite types of games. 

I will second the already mentioned **Lanterns** and **Cacao**. Both games are in heavy rotation at our house. 

Others tile games to consider that we also enjoy. 

**Citrus** - Rahdo has a good run down on this and it is one of his top games. We enjoy it as well. It's hard to find and I believe in the states it's only available through miniature market as an import copy. 

**Takenoko** - Not a pure tile layer, however it is definitely a part of the game. Takenoko plays light like Carcassonne, but has as much or as little conflict as you care to play. Looks great on the table too.  

If you haven't already done so, adding **Traders and Builders** as well as **Inns and Cathedrals** Carcassonne expansions to the vanilla mix definitely ramps up the direct interaction of Carcassonne and makes it much more strategic.  

We like **New York 1901**, but it's very light. Even lighter than Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride. While it plays on a central board, players are still basically playing within their own domain and there is little interaction other than trying to be the first to capture the best places on the board. It's good, but may not scratch the same itch as Carcassonne does.
A couple more I didn't see mentioned: **Kingdoms** and **Qin**
**Tigris and Euphrates** is almost literally the combination of tile laying on a central board with direct player interaction. It is also a masterpiece. Do check it out.
How does she feel about trains? It really doesn't matter than there is an aversion. I would suggest **railways of the world** tile laying to create routes to move good across, get the best connections. It's a step up from carcassonne but it's not a difficult game. My wife and everyone I've ever played itnwith has loved it.
oh what a year. In no particular order:

Mechs vs Minions
Mansions of Madness (second edition)
Arkham Horror LCG
London Dread

Bar is pretty high for 2017 tbh 
**Mechs vs. Minions**
Mechs Vs. Minions is likely my game of the year. Just the right amount of chaos and control for a co-op game. 
I have it played it, but the most well received co-op of 2016, at least in BGG rating, might be **Pandemic: Iberia**.
**Black Orchestra**? I think this just came out. 
Not out this year, but new to me: Eight Epics by Seiji Kanai. Its very difficult, but super fun. Travel size and only $15. As a downside, it suffers the alpha leader problem, but also plays well solo.

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/177210/eight-epics
Others here will disagree but my group plays the hell out of Zombicide:Black Plague.
Beyond Baker Street!
You're a team of detectives trying to out-solve Holmes! It's a small, short game....could actually be played with a standard deck of cards, but the theme makes it easier to explain the rules...
**Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle** actually seems pretty good so far!  It's a co-op deckbuilder.
**The Ravens of Thri Sahashri** 2p only.
Where is Time Stories ?? :O
NEVER get an expansion thinking it will "fix" a game for you. If you don't like the game getting an expansion won't fix it. I personally cannot play LoW without the expansion, but with teh expansion its a great game, which I still sometimes even play just because its a pretty straight forward game, and offers a lot of options and a c

Viticulture, and Agricola are both very fun games, and I really like both. You really cannot go wrong with either. Agricola is probably the heavier game, but Viticulture has more theme to it, imo
I doubt Skullport will save LoW for you.  It definitely improves the game, but don't expect it to renew your interest if you're feeling ready to move on.

For deeper, worker-placement with theme, you should check out **Yedo**.

**Agricola** is a good, solid choice for WP as well.
I really like Lords of Waterdeep, and the expansion improves it a lot. It's hard to say if it will fix it for someone who doesn't like it. Viticulture I also love, haven't played as much though, but is only marginally more complex. I also like Agricola but despite being worker placement is very different to the others, being more about sustaining yourself instead of completing quests/orders. I really like the worker placement system so its hard to know if my recommendation means much.
**The Manhattan Project** is basically LoW for people who don't like LoW and want a good theme.  Thats probably what I'd recommend.

**Argent: The Consortium** is the logical step up from LoW in terms of complexity and depth.  I'm not sure it fits too well with clean gameplay and short set up time.  Its more of an everything and the kitchen sink, too, and thats before even talking about the expansion.
I don't really like Lords of Waterdeep all that much. I prefer Agricola and New Bedford. But more than all of those, I prefer Viticulture. I would suggest getting V:EE and if you need more to it than that, grab Tuscany: EE, too.

If you want something with a ton of choices, I hear A Feast for Odin is great.
I highly recommend Viticulture. I also wanted to get a game to fill the worker placement gap in my collection and decided to splurge on the 2nd edition with Tuscany. I haven't even gotten to play with most of the expansion yet (some of which the EE comes with) and everyone I've played it with has enjoyed it.

I think the trick is the game is simple enough to catch on quick and have a good time playing while having enough depth that my gf seems to win more often than not.

The theme is good, things like ageing your wine help sell it, though worker placement theme breaks are present  (why would someone harvesting their field prevent me from harvesting mine?)

Setup is fast, not quite as quick as Roll for the Galaxy, but faster than Mechs vs Minions (love both those games btw)

I can't compare to any other worker placement games though, as nothing in the genre has grabbed my interest since getting Viticulture!
i've only played Lords of Waterdeep.. the theme that does exist (which isn't very strong) didn't appeal to me.. therefore I sold it. I much preferred **Stone Age** as an intro worker placement game because the theme made a lot more sense to make. I recently got **Champions of Midgard** for free to review/try out. I've read that the viking theme is really good in that game and is a minor step up from Stone Age in terms of complexity/worker placement. TableTop I believe has videos of Lords of Waterdeep, Stone Age, and recently did Champions of Midgard.

If you are looking for a heavier worker placement, maybe **Caverna** or **Agricola** as you mentioned. I would say they are fairly more complex than Lords of Waterdeep. I sold my copy of Agricola because the set up took awhile and I prefer playing the iOS version. 
Alright, so a bit about me so you understand where I'm coming from. 

I LOVE super heavy games. Games like Terra Mystica are my game of choice any day. I also love Scythe and Five Tribes was my first "big boy" game I ever bought. 

For the longest time, I only played the game with expansions. It's honestly how I think the game should be played at all times. 

However, when I got the app, it really helped me understand why that was. With only one place for adventurers at each turn, making your moves becomes "well, I guess I have to wait a turn to do this quest because someone happened to take the rogues". 

In the expansion, you're making decisions like "do I want to take less things this turn and turn this in, or maybe get a corruption token, or maybe just wait until next turn". It gives you so many more interesting decisions and also makes the game so much faster with corruption. 

Does this answer your question?
BTDG to me was faster and more frenetic fun plus enjoyed hidden roles more. The dice faces were more interesting than KoT's 123 and I dislike Fuse since I dislike real time.
We own or have owned all of these. **Fuse** fell flat with my family because it turns out no one but me likes timed games. Bummer. Traded it **Bang!: The Dice Game** is lots of fun but really shines at higher player counts. **King of Tokyo** is by far one of our favorites. We really enjoy "take that" elements in games and there's nothing more satisfying than chucking dice and attacking your loved ones. :)



If you're playing with a low number, I can't suggest Bang. If not, however, you really can't go wrong with any of them. I'd recommend KoT over just about anything, though, so I may be a little biased.
I like Bang! The Dice Game a lot more than FUSE. I haven't played King of Tokyo yet. I have considered buying it, but when I watch videos, it just doesn't look that good. I think I'd have to play it before buying it, really.

Like another commenter said, I'd rather be playing another social deduction game than Bang! The Dice Game, and my drug of choice is Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, followed closely by The Resistance. Neither has dice, though...

So, as far as dice-based games go, compared to FUSE, I'd much rather play Roll for the Galaxy, Pandemic: The Cure, Marvel Dice Masters: Ultimate X-Men, Kingsburg, or Cosmic Run, personally (Cosmic Run being the lightest in that grouping, I think). FUSE is unique, though, so there's that. I just don't find it fun at all, just annoying and stressful, and not really in a good way.
I've got Bang :TDG and King of Tokyo.

I prefer Bang because I have a special place in my heart for social deduction, misdirection, and hidden information. It's even better with the old saloon expansion because the first person eliminated becomes a ghost and still influences the game. There's a dice to promote healing and one for desperate attacks.

King of Tokyo is more "family" friendly. If you don't want to get picked on, you leave Tokyo. The upgrade powers keep it feeling fresh each time. My wife won her first game with herbivore power, all she did was roll hearts and victory points.
I've played all three and they are all good, they fill completely different niches. There's so many games in the hobby that use dice that the idea that you need a 'dice' game is a bit silly.

Bang and King of Tokyo have player elimination, so that's one negative against them. It's worse for King of Tokyo, the game can sometimes result in one player getting unlucky and out in the first 10 minutes, and then taking another 20 minutes to finish. Bang the dice game tends to have more damage going out each round than is possible to heal, so once players start to die, the game gets pretty quick, maybe another 5 or 10 minutes.

Bang however plays much better with 5 or more people, it's pretty average with 4 and I wouldn't play it with 3. King of Tokyo is good, but I'd say a max of 4 or 5, playing with 6 is a lot of downtime and if you get eliminated early it sucks.

Fuse is co-op so everyone plays at once. It's fun, bit tense at times, but like most co-ops it can still suffer from being 'solved'. There's some obvious right moves, and some of the tasks you have to do are objectively easier/harder, so there's good reasons to give priority of dice to one task or another. The real time aspect does help a bit with it, but once you've developed a system, which will happen if you play it enough it becomes routine
**FUSE** is a very versatile game - it plays well solo, 2p, 5p, etc. It's also a real-time game, which is a rare thing that you should definitely experience! Out of your options, I'd consider it a no-brainer.
**King of Tokyo** has probably brought the most joy, but I really enjoy the tension of **Fuse**.
I haven't played fuse, but i own the other 2. King of Tokyo is what I pull out with 4 or less players. Bang! The dice game cones out above that.

KoT to me slows down too much once you get above 4 or so players. Bang! Doesn't really get fun until you've got 5 or more in my eyes. Its pretty boring with just 3 or 4
Fuse is my favorite,  I love the set play time so you know what you are in for and I love that is a little bit thinky without any room for AP and I love the crazy communication chaos working all together trying to decide who gets what but since everyone has their own bombs and you are under pressure with the time limit you can't really quarterback but you can still try,  heh, so you don't need to restrain yourself if your the type that does that and I love the randomization with not knowing what dice you are going to grab as well what will be rolled or what bombs will come up next so while there's just a little bit of planning with what's available is not a perfect puzzle and we just really feel the tension of the theme in this game. 

Having said that,  BtDG gets the most play, it's just so easy to get out as well as take on the road with us and there's almost no set up and can get played even when we are burnt out at the end of the day and short on time.

On the other hand,  while it's my least favorite of the 3, KoT is the easiest to bring out with nongamers... it's the only one of the 3 I can get my mother to play and it seems to be the easiest to garner immediate interest for new players and for them to quickly grasp and begin playing without feeling awkward or  "breaking" the game somehow by misunderstanding a rule during play.
I found KoT to be pretty boring, personally. We own it, but I got tired of it quick. FUSE is great. It's frantic, chaotic fun, and I love brining it out - especially at two players. Can't speak to Bang!
I know I have an unpopular opinion, but **Fuse** is by far my favorite out of all those games.  Whenever I play **Bang** I'd rather be playing any of the other plethora of social deduction games out there, and whenever I'm playing **King of Tokyo** it's just not that interesting to me.

**Fuse** though is almost on that same level as **Hanabi** for me where I play it, I rarely ever win, but I always see myself and the other players getting better.
I love this game, don't understand at all the shit it's taking.  Our group already got another copy to play again.  Guess I'll have to buy enough to make this sequel happen.
That's great to hear, I've really been enjoying our playthrough!
My group is having a blast with it, I would try a sequel.
Well the response to the first one was definitely mixed in some corners, but with the benefit of experience I imagine any sequels will be more polished. 

I think a lot of people also came in with the wrong expectations ... people were expecting something like Pandemic Legacy, which was very easy to learn and played fast. 

Guess we'll have to wait and see. 
I would gladly give this game a go, however, finding a few dedicated individuals who will stick it through til the end is holding me back.
So, no?
Well, that's one way to try to squeeze a few extra sales out an underperforming game.
https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/bobs-burgers-not-impressed.gif
Maybe make a non-Legacy version of Seafall, Pandemic Legacy works because people know Pandemic
I have not played SeaFall, but if I did, and wanted a sequel, let me decisions from SeaFall 1 move to SeaFall 2. Also don't give me a Mass Effect 3 ending. :) IF YOU'RE READING THIS CREATORS...
I personally dislike the random card line of Ascension, Star Realms, and DC Deckbuilder. With Dominion, the feeling of planning and timing your purchase order is a bit stronger. That being said, the random elements and simplified choices makes those games much more accessible and a bit more replayable to some degree.
One thing no one mentioned yet: Dominion is the king of replayability in my mind.  Many games reveal their strategy within a few plays so that he thinking part of the game loses its fun.  Because of all the different combinations that become available when choosing the 10 kingdom cards (especially with a few expansions), every game has a fresh puzzle, and requires new thought.  For that reason, Dominion will keeping making it to my table again and again.
Dominion certainly has the drier theme and setup is a nuisance, but it has a lot to recommend it over Ascension. The two biggest gameplay differences between Dominion and Ascension are that Ascension has two main resource types other than VP, and that the cards available to be bought (or killed; whatever) are constantly changing. And it can very well be argued that these are both changes for the worst. Indeed, the Dominion designer deliberately avoided them for a reason.

Having two resource types means that quite often you draw a crappy hand with a little of both, but not enough to buy something good. That's a really nasty, unfun source of bad luck. The Alchemy expansion of Dominion introduces a second resource for buying things (Potions), and does so in a very careful manner in order to mitigate these problems: no card costs more than one Potion, so you never get a hand that's half Potions; you typically only have one in your deck. Even still, this is by far the least popular Dominion expansion.

Having a card market that constantly changes means you can't really plan ahead much. If you try to build an interesting deck around some unusual strategy/combo/synergy, and then the cards for that deck don't become available, you're sunk. So you wind up playing every game with the same generic flexible style. That's not an absolute statement: you still have to think about what's in your deck and whether the new card you're buying would fit in, but relative to Dominion there is a lot less variety in deck types. 

The other problem with the Ascension market row is both players don't have access to the same cards. If I get a really great card in the opening, that sucks for you. You'd hope that this type of luck would average out over the course of the game (and you might say the same about the dual resource system) but the nature of deckbuilding games is that a small lead in the early game can snowball really hard. That first great card lets you get more great cards, which in turn get you more great cards. So you have to be *very* lucky later and/or outplay me significantly if I get a lucky break at that stage. 

Finally, personally, I find there are just a lot of no-brainer decisions in Ascension. Because you have unlimited actions, you never really have to think whether a given card will *hurt* your hand or deck, especially if that card has "Draw a card."
Thanks for all of the opinions. I can see where the dislike for Ascension comes from. Anyone have recommendations for the order in which to dive into Dominion expansions, and how to store them?
Alternative answer: check out Valley of the Kings. It has a dynamic setup, but you can actively influence it with your card play. It also involves a unique set making mechanic in deck building wherein you're always deciding whether to use your card now or make sure it scores at the end. The best part? It's super cheap, and there's only 2 expansions
I like them both, and I think they scratch different itches. Dominion is for when I want to mull over my card choices and build up an engine based on the static kingdom in front of me.

Ascension is for when I don't want to have to think very hard - just toss my hand on the table and kill some stuff for little plastic gems. 

It's a little easier to get folks to play Ascension, because it's flashier and looks more like Magic. It also has a board and fiddly bits. It goes pretty fast even with high player counts. 

Given the choice, I'll almost *always* choose Dominion, though, because I enjoy strategic games more than tactical ones. The random market in Ascension makes things too much about reacting for me rather than thoughtful acquisition and execution of combos.
Dominion is a much heavier game, much less chance involved. At the beginning of the game you know exactly what will be available to purchase the entire game. There's more strategy in how to buy what and when. 

I'm an avid star realms player, ascension scratches the same itch but it's slower and less directly competitive. Dominion feels slower and unless you happen to have attacks, there is no player interaction.

I own all 3, enjoy all 3, but star realms is my go to deck builder. I enjoy directly competitive games and significant player interaction.
Ascension vs. Dominion comes down to strategy vs. tactics. In Dominion, you can look at the market and decide how you are going to play the game. Sure you have to watch your opponent and make subtle adjustments based on how well the game is going for each of you and how soon you expect the game to end, but all of that is minor. Ascension, on the other hand, is a game of constant decisions. Each turn, you look at the available cards and decide which of them is going to work well with what is already in your deck.

Most of the board game fans are interested in heavy euros. They like the strategic certainty of Dominion over the unpredictably of Ascension.

I vastly prefer Ascension over any fixed market deck builder that I have ever played. I would not recommend it though. I would recommend **Star Realms**, **Legendary Marvel**, or **Brass Empire**. They have all taken the basic Ascension deck building and added a twist to it that keeps it the center of the game but makes it more interesting. As for the Ascension expansions, when I tried them, I thought that they were solid and well designed, but very gimmicky.
Has anyone mentioned this is euro vs american?
I'm more of an **Ascension** fan myself. It's just more exciting to play and look at than **Dominion**, which is mostly a matter of taste. **Ascension** is just more pleasing for me to look at and more exciting to play. The game thrives on making those insane combos, being the person who managed to grab that high powered card (or denying it from others), and it always feels good when you have a pile of little plastic gems in front of you. 

**Dominion**... well, it kinda feels like deck building for the sake of deck building, and as such I find it a bit dull. It doesn't help that I've played games that use the **Dominion** style marketplace that I enjoyed much more, like **Trains** & **Arctic Scavengers**. They give a clear, interesting, and very thematic purpose for why you are going through the trouble of building a deck, which just helps me be more invested in playing. Just trying to collect cards with point values on them doesn't really do anything for me.
The thing that bothers most people about Ascension is the card display mechanic (can't remember it's name, but how all cards are shuffled into one deck and 5 are drawn to make up the market). It can make things really swingy in a competitive game, unlike the legendary games (thay also use this mechanic) because who cares if it's a coop game. Ascension has also fallen aside because (a) the app is out and it'd easier to play games there, (b) other games (eg the legendary series) have improved upon it so much. Dominion's app by contrast is pretty bleh last time I checked.

In contrast Dominion's design is more elegant and less reliant on luck besides the natural luck of drawing your hand. You know what's on the table and can plan accordingly. I'm no longer as big of a fan of the game as I once was because the ridiculous engines and powerful attacks can make the game very boring for other players who must wait on your turn. 
Ascension is full of bad rng. Its really that simple. Its a shallow gimmick.
You wanted a list ;):    
* Pax Porfiriana  
* Keyflower  
* Lewis & Clark  
* Rokoko  
* Coal Baron  
* Village + Village Inn exp  
* Snowdonia  
* Bruxelles 1983  
* Shakespeare

* Trajan  
* Suburbia - it does look abstract, but for me it is closest to city building. You are trying to build up your economic engine (income, reputation/population) to be sustainable in order to grow your borough. Great game.
Mombasa may be a bit of a step up in terms of complexity from the current games you enjoy. But Tal a great game just a little towards the heavy end of medium weight games.

Maybe check out **Concordia**, I've had very good reactions from teaching gamers that love Catan.
Kingdom builder
There are so many great games to choose from, just from 2016!

Mombasa is very good, but I might enjoy Alexander's newest game even more, that is Great Western Trail.

Terraforming Mars has also come out this year, and it's an amazing game, I just want to play it over and over!

I don't know if you have played any of Uwe Rosenberg's games, but his newest one, A Feast for Odin is another big, heavy and amazing game! 

Other than that, Suburbia is great if you want something lighter than the ones I have reccomended! There is sooo many videos on "best games" in many different categories, so those should give you a lot of help too :) 
Excellent game!  It has quickly become one of my more requested games at meetups.  Easy to teach.  Short play time, but doesn't feel like a filler.  Variable scoring tiles make every game feel different.  Plays best with more players though.  I'll pretty much only bring it out when there are 4 or 5 people.
Terrific. The pricing addition to tried and true tile laying, combined with variable scoring, gives IoS a ton of engagement and replay.
A modern classic. 

Takes the play style of Castles of mad king Ludwig and simultaneously makes it simpler and deeper. Also, it generates some great table banter. Our most played game of this year and a truly inspired design.
i actually don't like this one, and have been a little surprised at how popular it is. i find the pricing mechanism of the game introduces a lot of chaos/swinginess into the mix, which feels out of place. to price things well you need to be aware of what everyone wants/needs (which is not always obvious just from looking at what features are scoring that round), what you need, what's available, and a rough sense of how much  money other people have. in the games i've played, there is *a lot* of underpaying for valuable tiles and overpaying for less valuable ones. furthermore, this single element appears to have a greater impact on scoring than the puzzly tile placement.

ultimately it feels too random/swingy for what it appears to be (a contemplative tile placer) *for me*.

the scoring system is cool though, and i would like to see that used in other games.
I enjoyed it, though it did seem way better to not give a crap about any of the early game scoring things and focus on the late game scoring tiles. Not only do you get more turns to make late game scoring worth more, but by being behind in points, you get free coins. 

It would take a few games to properly assess how valuable a tile is. From the games I've played people have undershot and they get their precious tiles bought from under them, creating lots of bitterness.
so good
Awesome game!
It's fairly quick. Has some deep thought but relatively simple actions.

What I don't like is playing with people that feel the need to calculate the value of every tile for every player in detail at all stages of the game. It should be a 20 to 30 minute at max game with 5 players. 

With some people however they want to calculate the value of all 3 of their tiles for themselves and for every other player, take into account how much each player can afford. Then they want to 'test' each other tile when its their turn to buy to see if it'll fit and calculate how many points they'll get at each position they can put it. So what should be a max of about 1 minute decision turns into 4 or 5 minutes and the game that should be over in 20 minutes takes an hour.

Basically don't play with people that are AP or can't make decision based on gut instinct, because otherwise it's too slow for what it offers.
It's great if you enjoy auction/bidding games. I wasn't a fan of always trying to arbitrarily figure out what the tiles are worth to you & others to avoid getting shortchanged, or overpaying. 
I've only just gotten it myself, so I can't tell if it will stand up over time. But I'm loving it so far. Just the right amount of weight to me, in that there are some meaty choices to make each game, but it's still fast and easy to teach and learn. Also I really like games with variable scoring conditions like this one has, really helps to avoid falling into ruts of always valuing the same tiles the same way.
If you need someone to take it off your hands, just let me know
We really like it. I've never played with more than two people. Our only complaint is that it is too short. When we get to the end we always remark that we wish it went longer. 
Amazing! Probably the quickest a game has reached my top 10 from time of purchase.
I'd say I rather not say anything. You got the game and should play it. Otherwise you get biased by opinions of randoms (I still love you, folks).

If you had your chance to play a few rounds already, let me tell you: Congrats and keep having fun :)
I mainly game with my SO she didn't like it! But I really liked the game especially bc it's always a different game due to the different objectives! I don't play it much but I would play it any time
Your not the only one seeing no progress. I placed my order late Wednesday and still nothing...
I'm having major issues with their site as well. I placed an order of 5 items but kept getting an AVS rejection. This was Saturday so I called the number in the FAQ and left a message. Then I got a call from the bank about fraud protection, and told them to allow one of the charges. Asmodee never called back, half my order is out of stock, still can't get a hold of them. Had to re-order today on a different card. I love these prices, but it's been a real hassle.
Nov 28th is Monday...is that what they meant?
Thank you so much! I had the same issue but figured with the sale, they probably had a ton of orders. I didn't want to waste their time checking on the status when it's just a simple delay. I feel much better knowing I'm. It the only one who worried about the delay. 
My pending charge also poofed but did not process.  I freaked out and emailed customer support before I found this thread.  Here is the prompt response I received:

"This seems to be a common thing happening, where the charge will temporarily show up for the pre-authorisation to make sure the funds are there, but then not be visible again until the order ships. Your order appears to be processing as normal, but you are welcome to check with your bank once you get notice that your order ships and if your charge doesn’t show up then."
I was about to post this. Got the same email!
Two separate orders, none of which has shipped. One is still showing as pending inpmy credit card, the other has disappeared. 
Im in the same thing, i ordered the past thursday and it's still pending :/
Not yet.  I actually bought something separate from the holiday sale via FFG (the Arkham Horror LCG Arkham Nights scenario) after I placed a holiday sale order, and I've already recieved it
Does the game use dice, or cards? Perhaps a dice bag/cup, or sleeves to fit the cards...
It's kind of lame to do the gift card, but if her wishlist sucks you have to do what you can. 
As a secret santa gift-card receiver from last year, let me tell you... DONT GIFT GIFTCARDS! They are a huge let-down. 

Honestly ... gift cards suck ... 

And now for creative ideas: If you cant find games from the wishlist, try getting game-addons. Dice, DiceTowers, Boardgame Organizers, Bags, Card Sleeves, if she is into miniature gaming, maybe even a Learn-To-Paint-Kit?

Or maybe you can find a game that is not on the list, but similar? Like Dominion to Ascension? 

Hell even if it is gaming related-merch (Posters, Books, etc). That would be a better gift than a gift card... those cards are always a huge let-down for the receiver and almost spoiled the secret santa for me last year.
Curious about this:

What is the game? I swear I'm not her :) just curious
Have you included shipping already?
How about a cheap filler. I would rather take that than a gift card any day. One of the joys of Secret Santa is picking out a gift for someone. With a gift card, you are telling them to pick for themselves. At that point, why not just have everyone take $50, buy themselves a game.

Have you tried reaching out to your target to see if she can add some cheap stuff to the list? If your target is the type that says that their list is the only thing that they want and will accept, then yeah, send the gift card. Even better, get a gift card for 49.56 and only send that.
**Survive: Escape from Atlantis**. Not exactly the same as roll-and-move, but pretty close and it's a really simple, fun take-that style game.

**Jamaica** would also be a pretty good option. It is roll and move and really easy to play.
If you are stuck with going to Target to grab games then your only real options are **Catan**, **King of Tokyo**, or **Codenames**.  I personally would suggest **Codenames** since it works in almost any scenario (but it's not a rolling game at all), but if you need a dice game I would go with **King of Tokyo** for it's theme and recognizable **Yahtzee** mechanics over **Catan** (which is still a solid great gateway game to grab).
Are Target and Toys R Us your only options? I know ours normally aren't well stocked. Best thing they have I can think of that kinda matches what you want is **King of Tokyo**.
Talisman or Relic 
You could look into Ticket to Ride as well. It is not a roll and move, but very easy to  pick up. 


Edit: and both stores are likely to carry it
You need a 'gateway game'.
Definitely try Carcassonne.
You seem to have missed your calling in /r/boardgamescirclejerk
Racial techs that are really strong:

* Barony's Non-Euclidean Shielding is bonkers with Duranium Armor
* Mentak's Mirror Computing combined with Transfabrication is a really powerful engine
* Yssaril's Mageon Implants - Letting the best race in the game steal the best action cards is almost overkill

Outside of these, I don't think any are "too good" and those above aren't good enough to not use a fun feature that actually makes some of the weaker races playable.

Flagships are very slow and expensive, I think only the Nekro's would cause any feel bad moments (a new player might not like losing their giant fleet in one fell swoop)

I think racial techs and flagships add more to make each race feel unique and exciting. I would want to play with them every game.

The game 17 races at this point.  Balance is out of the question, the question should be are the interactions interesting.  The answer is yes, and there is no overpowered combination.

The flagships and racial techs were largely used to boost the power of the weaker races.  The really good races got weaker racial techs and flagships.
I would advise you to head over to /r/twilightimperium or better yet this thread in particular: [an "optimal" first game of TI](https://www.reddit.com/r/twilightimperium/comments/1j3t1o/i_propose_we_discussdesign_an_optimal_first_game/)
No.

There are 10 copies listed in the GeekMarket at boardgamegeek.com. One of them was listed just 9 days ago. 
Do you mean Fist of Dragonst Ones?
I really just wish I could find somewhere to buy Inis! (EU) :)

**D&D Boardgames**

**Mice & Mystics**

**BANG!**
Aside from peace and love for everyone on earth my wishlist only contains **Star Wars Rebellion** 
We're getting so many games\* for Christmas I would probably be flogged by my wife if I even considered getting something during the sales. I'm still struggling to resist the temptation of **Claustrophobia** at half price. But I might be able to make a case for **Mysterium** and **Concept** if the price is right. And if **Star Trek Ascendancy** goes on deep discount... well, I'll just have to sleep on the couch till the New Year.

\* We're getting Castle Panic, Forbidden Desert, Sushi Go Party, Eight Minute Empire Lost Lands, Spyrium, Paperback, Hogwarts Battle, Saboteur, Carcassone Over Hill and Dale, and Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. 
I have like 20 games on my list.

The main 2 I really want are mission red planet and castles of mad King Ludwig though. Kemet would also be cool but I don't know if I want to spend 65 bucks or whatever it is for it.
I have a few games on my list- hopefully I get one or two (including gifting myself one):

1. Star Wars Destiny 
2. Legendary Encounters Alien
3. Welcome Back to the Dungeon 
4. Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective 

Scythe: Invaders from Afar
Village with Village Inn, Robinson Crusoe 2e, Merchants and Mauraders, Scythe, Escape the Curse of the temple, Agicola, Feast for odin, Orleans, Lancaster Big Box, Brewcrafters, Food Chain, Shadows of Brimstone either base set, Kodama, Gallerist. Just waiting for anything to go on sale on Amazon
My #1 has been **Arcadia Quest**. I'm a huge sucker for these kinds of games, and since I have Dungeons of Masmorra coming soon, I'd love to be able to use the pieces interchangeably. 

But that price tag is something that really can't be avoided too well. Especially with a move so close behind me, and with Christmas right around the corner, I don't think I'll be able to grab that one for a loooooooong time.


Off the beaten path of what most of you would call a sale but the upcoming Battleforce boxes for **Warhammer: Age of Sigmar** are going to be nice. I've been wanting to expand a couple of my armies and the price point on those boxes is going to seriously help diminish what was otherwise going to be pure wallet terror.
Viticulture, Black Orchestra, Grand Austria Hotel, and Arboretum... 
I sold all of my valuable Magic cards back in October for a massive CoolStuffInc gift certificate and have been stocking up since then, so I don't really *need* any board games for the holidays...

...with that said, there are plenty more that I want! Some big ones that I haven't pulled the trigger on yet are:

* Forbidden Stars
* Xia: Legends of a Drift System
* Descent
* Star Wars: Imperial Assault

I could put plenty more, but as it is I'm collecting them faster than I can play them! I love Magic like hell, but I'm really glad I made the switch. So many different experiences to have instead of dumping all of my cash into one game that only a few of my friends like to play.
If any of the following end up on sale I'll probably jump on them:

* **Concordia**
* **Brew Crafters**
* **Clockwork Wars**
* **Vast: The Crystal Cavern**
* **Tash-Kalar**

And I'll be picking up the **Alchemists: The King's Golem** expansion shortly no matter what happens.
Here's mine. Debating on putting this on a wish list or buying them myself if I end up seeing good deals on black friday.

- Viticulture Essential Edition 
- Stockpile 
- Sushi Go Party 
- Love Letter Premium 
- Formula D 
- Las Vegas 
- Ice Cool 
- America 
- Happy Salmon
So far, I've bought in various sales/auctions for cheap:

* Ticket to Ride: Europe

* Castles of Mad King Ludwig

* 51st State: Master Set

* The Manhattan Project

* Tesla vs. Edison

* Memoir '44


And I'll be adding to my Christmas wish list:

* Concordia

* The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire

* Dream Home 

* Various expansions for 7 Wonders Duel, Orleans, and Tesla vs. Edison


I'm torn on a few other games to put on the wish list -- Scythe, Lanterns, and World's Fair 1893 are a few that look appealing.

I've got a bunch of games on my list:

* The Mansions of Madness 2e tile and figure packs
* Dead Last
* Arctic Scavengers with both expansions
* Mini painting supplies so I can try my hand with MoM2e 
Robinson Crusoe 2nd Ed - probably won't stock until after


El Alamein - again, probably no chance


Vinhos

Hoping to pick up some LOTR LCG expansions.
Honestly? Kids games. 

As a therapist, I use them every day with kids from toddlers to school-aged children. I can't get anything too complex (because the kids I work with have a variety of difficulties) but I don't mind simplifying them and changing the rules. 

Djeco, Janod, Melissa and Doug, SuperDuper, Smart Games, FoxMind make awesome games. I am hoping one day to have a great collection.
Currently looking at:  
**Eldritch Horror + Forsaken Lore + Strange Remnants**  
**Fabled Fruit**  
**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong**  
**Concordia: Salsa**
Back in Stock? I didn't think the Scythe expansion hit yet, I put in my miniature market preorder ages ago..
I don't buy games for myself a month out from Christmas
I think they're a lot of fun. I own Legend of Drizzt, and I have buddies who own Wrath of Ashardalon and Castle Ravenloft. It's neat that they're more or less compatible, so if I want to bring my Drizzt character into an Ashardalon game, I can do that. I would say Ashardalon is the easiest, and Ravenloft is the hardest, but overall you'll probably find all of them challenging. I have not played the newest one, Temple of Elemental Evil.
Yes, I found the D&D boardgames to be very decent beer & pretzels affairs that you could set up and run in an hour or so. Everyone gets to roll a d20 and do some hack and slash, and it all packs up quickly after the fact. My personal favorite out of all of them was **Wrath of Ashardalon**, but that may have just been because of the cool red dragon mini. The Balrog (sorry, *Balor*) miniature in **Legend of Drizzt** was nice too, but I didn't enjoy the actual game as much.

edit - It's also worth noting that no one has to be DM for those games - it's all handled by random tile draws and a dungeon deck.
i think they're a lot of fun, and can satisfy that D&D itch. That said - Ravenloft is a bitch. I feel that the cards are stacked against you higher than the others.
Why not just zombicide: Black Plague? Fantasy archetypes, acquire loot, kill zombies.
I would say they fit your criteria. I own all three, and also use them as a break from DMing. My group likes them, though one player always complains about how ridiculously hard Ravenloft in particular is. 
Your approach sounds good and there are a bunch of ways to do it. I will recommend not painting the insides of the teeth though. Makes it really hard to turn the gears later. I had done it then needed to sand them off to let them move. Tedious. 
[Here is how I did mine](http://imgur.com/gallery/Wo6aR). I used the simplest method possible, but honestly I like mine more than any I've seen. They look really great on the table. 

No matter what you do, remember it's super easy to start over! Soak them in Simple Green and scrub them off with an old toothbrush and give it another go.
I'm not a painter at all so I took somebody's advice on BGG, primed everything black and then basically drew on the color with these [paint pens](https://www.amazon.com/Uni-posca-Paint-Marker-Pen-PC-1M12C/dp/B001VB4T86). The one I used I think was either a eight or ten pack but they worked brilliantly and, apart from being time consuming, I ended up with something pretty nice. The raised lines on the gear keeps the surface tension of the paint from spilling off in most cases and it really just becomes an exercise in tracing lines with a steady hand.

I'm away from home for the week so I can't snap you a picture but if you're curious I can send you one next week so you can see how it came out.
I'm no master painter but I guess it depends on what type of color scheme you want to use for your Tzolkin gears. I personally wanted the center gear black so I had spray primed it black. I didn't need to use a wash or anything. And then I just took a small brush with the individual colors and very carefully and slowly traced the lines/designs that I wanted. After that, I sprayed on a sealant in Matte. Overall I'm happy with the results. 

[Painted Gears!](http://imgur.com/a/RJ6Id)
I had mainly followed the design of someone else on BGG and made some of my own additions on it
your plan sounds good, and to do better one thing I would recommend doing is to NOT spray primer 2-3 coats. You really only need 1. The primer, just makes it so the paint stays on the plastic better, using more won't make it stick any better. As the Tzolkin gears don't have too much detail it's not a big deal, however, if you ever get into painting minis, too much primer, may cover up some folds, or the finer details.

The wash/shade/ink is a nice, but not necessary for something like the gears, but its a nice touch that makes your minis bring it to the next level. I recommend Citadel's Nuln oil, for all purpose shade. its about $4. You can basically shade at any step before the clear(matte) spray sealer. However, I like to shade before I dry brush, as I like my minis a bit brighter, but you can also shade after your dry brush, to have an overall darker tone to it
Between the base coat and the dry brush I'd use a wash, it gives it more depth. You can also dry brush with two different similar colors, wich also helps with making the color less flat. The last suggestion is definitly not necessary though.
**Splendor** could be good. The only text on a card is its cost.
How about **Hanabi**? 
Codenames pictures
**Galaxy Trucker** might be a good option. Most of the communication the game does with you is through pictures and numbers.
**Codenames Pictures** is a a lot of fun, especially if you have 6 people. There isn't much depth as far as strategy goes, but it does make you think.

Did you have something against **Mysterium?** it also has almost no reading for the players channeling the spirit. 
Tsuro, Lanterns, and Splendor are all great games with no reading.
How familiar are they with games? Something like 7 Wonders could work since it's all symbols, but its rules are heavier than Dixit.
* **Qwirkle** is good for all ages, though might be hard for anyone who's colorblind.
* **Ingenious** is another great abstract, same caveat
* **Indigo** has gone over well with family for me.
* **Carcassonne** has no reading after the initial rules explanation

edit - **Lanterns** is in the same vein but has different graphics for the colored tiles, so it's easier to distinguish.
**Spyfall**

Great game where everyone is working together to figure out who is the spy in a group of people.

**Celestia** 

Push your luck game where players are trying to get the most amount of points possible. Relies quite a lot on colors though.

**Sheriff of Nottingham**

A bluffing game where players are trying to get the most amount of money by the end of the game through the goods they try to get into Nottingham. There is a good bit of text on cards, but this is easily supplemented by the pictures and color of the cards that give enough information.
Many abstract games will fit the bill. Here are some abstracts from my collection. All of these games have no text on any of the pieces.

* Hive
* Blokus
* Quarto
* Quits
* Quoridor
* Qwirkle

Takenoko? Has cards, but they're symbols.
**Concept** would work if you are okay with choosing your own phrases and words to convey instead of relying on the English cards.
**The Hare and the Tortoise** might be good for you. It's a quick and easy game we often play with guests. I wouldn't said it has a lot of strategy in it, but now that I think about it, it certainly has more than Dixit or Mysterium. 

**Hanabi** is another great one that someone's already mentioned. Not fond of the weird scoring system though.

If you want something really intense, **Resistance** doesn't have any text that I can remember, mostly symbols. 
* Card games: **Biblios**, **Jaipur**, **Port Royal**
* **Discoveries**
* **Five Tribes**
* **Shakespeare**
* **Trajan** (its a little bit heavier maybe)

Tsuro doesn't involve any text. It's simple to learn, but it still has some strategy. 
**Sushi Go** has a very limited vocabulary and is mostly numeric. **Saboteur** and **Set** don't require text. If your parents are totally comfortable speaking, listening, and bluffing in English, then something like **Resistance** or **Werewolf** would be fine. I've actually played variants on regular Codenames with my adult ELL students. Either we use a subset of the deck and talk about the words beforehand, or we play a cooperative version that doesn't use the spy/bystander/assassin mechanic. One version is to take turns giving a clue for three words, any three words, and the first person to correctly guess the words wins the hand. (Sort of like one variant of Set.) The other version, which they preferred, was to come up with a sentence or story using their three cards. The second probably isn't up your alley, but the first might be.

BoardGameGeek has a language dependency metadata field. Anyone know how to filter by that?


Tsuro
Candy Land, just gotta tell colors apart. 
I don't know what your target price is, but boardgames.ca has it for $55.

Check out [this](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/208756/best-3-player-games-according-algorithm) geeklist for plenty of really good suggestions.
Arcadia Quest is a fun 2-4 player  game. Fighting invading monsters and each other, players compete to be the top guild after 6 scenarios. Each scenario has its own objectives, bosses and rewards. Between scenarios, use money collected to buy upgrades for your guild members.  
If your group is ok with a little friendly competition, this is fun game to play.

**Mechs vs Minions** is a coop game. Players control up to 4 mechs and try to fulfil objectives for the missions (there are 10 missions in the game). To control the mech, you draft a command card then put them in your programming board. Then, execute the program. Simple yet fun!
I've noticed you don't have any cooperative games in your collection, so I'll suggest a couple:

**Eldritch Horror** is my all time favorite game. It's a lengthy, meaty, but mechanically uncomplicated race against the insidious beings/forces you choose to oppose when you set up the game. Will make you a fan of Lovecraft if you aren't already.

**Pandemic** is not as great in my opinion as many people say, but it's relentless popularity and tightness in design can't be ignored. Players are doctors and experts attempting to prevent worldwide outbreaks; very puzzly in nature and lots of variation in plays and possibilities.

**Forbidden Desert**, another Leacock game like Pandemic, and follows a similar structure. I like it a lot more though because the theme of crashing in a desert and building a flying machine from dug up relics is pretty cool, it's shorter, and the component quality is great. Less dry puzzle and more adventure than Pandemic.

You also don't seem to have any med/heavy euros...

**Puerto Rico** is, like Pandemic, a game that has received tons of awards, and in my opinion I think it is much more deserving. Players own a plantation outside San Jose that they are attempting to develop and ship goods from. But what it becomes is a tactical play-by-play of manipulating the cool role selection mechanic to get the most out of other people's turns. Endless fun.

**Princes of Florence** is PR's overshadowed younger brother, and is basically an auction game mixed with a personal Tetris where you build a villa out of purchased tiles. The perfect amount of player interaction and heaviness for a euro without going overboard. The meat of the game is being a fine patron for artists and scientists and scholars, and it's oddly satisfying when your manor help them create a hugely scoring masterwork.

**Keyflower** is one of the golden children here on this subreddit, and it's basically PoF with a more complicated auction and tile system, and where scoring happens in a special way at the end of the final season (winter) as opposed to on your own terms. You will be very confused the first few times you play, but once strategies start to appear you can't help but love every moment.

Finally I'll just quickly mention a few games somewhat similar to what you have that I imagine would go over well:

**Cosmic Encounter**

**Roll for the Galaxy**

**Blood Rage**

**Love Letter**

**Abyss**

**Lords of Waterdeep**


Happy gaming!
Forbidden Island is a less intense version of Forbidden Desert. I love Forbidden Desert. 
Castle Panic is Co op and light.

Hanabi!   Burgled Bros is another great one! 
[**Flash Point: Fire Rescue**](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100901/flash-point-fire-rescue)

It's a little lighter than Pandemic.
Work as a team to rescue people (and sometimes cats) from a burning building while combating fire, smoke, and dealing with hazmat. Get everyone out of the building before it collapses to win the game.
[The Big Book of Madness](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/171233/big-book-madness)  is a pretty fun and lightweight co-op game. The theme is a bit lighter than the actual gameplay, but it's a fun game nonetheless! 
**Pandemic: The Cure** might be a good option then if she liked Pandemic but felt it a bit much.  It simplifies the game board, and uses dice.  It's more luck based, but overall easier.  
**Hanabi** can be quite fun 2 player for a few sessions.
Castle Panic, Tiny Epic Defenders, Forbidden Island and/or Forbidden Desert
[Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective)

Somewhat thick when it comes to problem-solving, but it's really easy to play. It makes you feel like you're Sherlock Holmes.
Burgle Bros?
Beyond Baker Street. That's been a huge success with my wife.
**Red November** is a very light co-op
[The Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173090/game) is really good.

[On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010W1E6CO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

The deck contains one of each card from 2 to 99.  Players cannot reveal what cards they hold but must play at least two cards from their hand on one of 4 columns.  Two columns go down, two go up.  However if you hold a card exactly 10 difference from a pile's value you can back it up.  At the end of your turn you draw cards for each card you played.  Goal is for players to play all cards.  Though you cannot say exactly what cards you have you can help direct play by calling columns, or saying how hard you're going to move a value.
One that I haven't seen mentioned is [Samurai Spirit.](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/158900/samurai-spirit) It's designed by Antoine Bauza who also designed Ghost Stories but I haven't played Ghost Stories so I can't compare them.

It takes anywhere from like 20-45 minutes.  Like most co-op games it can be super easy or brutally difficult depending on the luck of the draw.
**Harry Potter:Hogwarts Battle** Its a fun coop deck builder. Much better if you actually enjoy HP.

You might want to consider games that are basically cooperative but with one person separated from the rest. So **Mysterium**, **Dixit**, and **Not Alone**. I just threw Not Alone in there because I lacked a third example and wanted one, but it's still a light game that's mostly cooperative.

And, of course, since you mentioned Pandemic you should also look at **Pandemic: The Cure**.
Every store that sells board games will have black Friday sales 
I think Barnes and Noble is doing buy 1, get 1 half off. Only one I know of so far. 
Target is doing 50% off in store, but I'm not sure if it's select titles only. 
Are you sure you don't want Qwirkle?
I remember preferring Qwixx to Quinto but it's been a while since I've played -- and they're so similar, I can't really give any details as to why.

The deluxe version of Qwixx available at Target is nice because of the dry erase stuff, but then it doesn't travel as well because the box is bigger.

If you're set on one of the two, I'd vote Qwixx. Otherwise, I'd suggest you to explore the other options for short fillers as I didn't really care for either of them.
>I'm looking for a game beginning with "Qwi" but can't make up my mind which one...

:O
**Legends of Andor** is a great puzzley co-op, disguised as a RPG/Adventure game.
Hanabi is a puzzly card game. 
I would second Legends of Andor and Tragedy Looper. I would also point to Beyond Baker Street since it is very similar but is said to work better with 2 than Hanabi, and on top of that, it has theme.
Check out **Witness** maybe? Not as investigative as Sherlock Holmes, plays only with exactly 4, but every scenario in there is a puzzle. Shut up and Sit down has an amazing video review of that one.
I got a very strong puzzly feel from **Mansions of Madness**. I can't speak for the second edition that just came out, but the first edition had little physical puzzles you had to solve like rewiring the lights in a room before you can leave. 
You could try **Freedom the Underground Railroad**. 

It's got Euro-like mechanics that gives it thinky gameplay.
There's also **Tragedy Looper** but it's one vs 3. It's extremely puzzle-y and is basically a deduction game.
**Escape Room: The game** perhaps.  I haven't tried it yet but it looks interesting.  
Burgle bros' variable setup and guard movement mechanic make it feel like a huge puzzle to me. Everyone has to be as efficient as possible with their limited action points and using their special power, in order to win.
**World's Fair 1893**, the balance between area control, set collecting, and almost a pick up and deliver mechanics pack a really great depth into an incredibly streamlined and fast playing game where every move feels like it has meaningful consequences.
Something I picked up in Essen is **Brain Storm**. I haven't seen any mention of it on here, so I guess it counts as little known. 

You lay out 9 cards with pictures on them in a grid and your goal is to combine two of them. A picture of a baby and a calendar can be combined to 'birthday', but you can also use attributes. Using a black cat with the calendar can give you 'black Friday', and so on. I like it because you need to be creative, it plays with many players (really the limit is who can see and reach the table), it is fast and it does have those 'wow'-moments, when someone comes up with a clever combination. 
Not seen much about Dale of Merchants! Well worth your time.
**Crab stack** was quite good for quick abstracts that play 2-4 reminded me of dvonn but in a quicker package. It was fun. I like that time frame and colorful abstracts are just fun for me. 

I think despite a successful Kickstarter **Harbour** flew under the radar. I recently got to play it after watching but not backing the Kickstarter and it's great. It's a really smooth playing game that is in a small box but isn't a shallow game. The size isn't a selling point for me but it matters to some. 

**Vikings on board** seems like it might fall under the radar but i really enjoy it. It's probably overproduced but whatever. There are far worse things to be accused of. Ultimately it's a very fun very mean game in 45 minutes. Best with four though. Ok with three. Haven't played with two but don't feel like i need to. 
**Council of Blatkthorn** - Full disclosure, I helped run the KS for this game.  But the game has been getting solid 8 ratings from users on BGG.  And it's a game that I've played a 100 times this year but still enjoy.  (I also see that Miniature Market has it on sale for only $27 which you can't beat.)
1. Jaipur
2. Pandemic
3. Cube Quest
4. Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective 
5. Patchwork

My fiance and I really like two-player Hanabi. Great game for improving communication, too. 
7 Wonders Duel and Agricola All Creatures Big and Small are two games I would recommend to a gaming couple too.
Great list.  Jaipur didn't really do it for me, but Patchwork, Sherlock, and Pandemic have been favorites for me and my wife.  (I haven't played Cube Quest yet, but I own it and am looking forward to it.)
My wife and I like to take Hive with us when are going out to a bar or restaurant sometimes. We've played about 40 games of it and she has yet to beat me. So now she just brings Jaipur.
One of our favorites is the game Morels.  :)
I'll throw **Star Realms** into the ring as well
I'll throw **Lost Cities** the card game, not the board game, into the mix here.  My wife and I absolutely love it and it's super portable and easy to play.  My mother-in-law likes it because she can win too.
Splendor. Any day, any time. Is just that good
Thank you for making this into a short video and not a 30 minute slog.
To add to that list, I'd suggest taking a look at [Hounded](http://www.atlas-games.com/product_tables/AG1380.php) by Atlas Games.  

I'm biased since I'm its designer - but I developed and playtested it with my girlfriend, which is why I think it turned out as a fun couples competitive strategy game.  Atlas Games and I recently did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5dmt9w/ama_designer_and_producer_of_hounded_a_twoplayer/) you can check out.  Gameosity also [Reviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzrCxUS6o6Q) it recently and had a similar feeling.
My girlfriend's a costume designer by trade, so she'll either love or hate me for bringing Patchwork into our life. Thanks for the recommend!
Shopping list for X-mas? Done... 

The only thing I'm worried about at this point is what happens when the wife and I both buy each other the same games. :p
These are okay, but none of them are Rhino Hero. Working at a board game cafe, that game would be a hit with couples 80% of the time. Maybe it's a better  date game.
My SO and i been playing the big book of madness none stop, Great game
My wife, who does not like complicated board games and wasn't that interested in Pandemic, LOVES viticulture. It's 2-5 players and has a fun wine making theme. We always pour a glass when we sit down and play. 
Jaipur has great strategies and bluffing techniques. 

I love the co-op aspect of Sherlock. 

My SO and I LOVE Agricola: All creatures big and small.

We also love HIVE for a quick chess-like strategic game.

How does Patchwork compare to these games? How deep is it? How is the replayability? 
My wife loves Castles of Burgundy 1v1. Probably because she wins more than not.
I really cannot recommend Targi enough. It has a unique mechanic and is robust and deep but not overly complex. It's well done and interesting and as an added bonus the lore includes the fact that the women are the heads of the tribes so wives tend to like that. For some reason. 
A couple of other games my girlfriend and I play quite often that we enjoy:
- Rivals for Catan
- Mancala
- Cribbage


Or you could put your relationship in jeopardy every time by playing Twilight Struggle :-)
This was the perfect day to join this subreddit. SO and I are moving into our tiny house this year and are looking for more two player games. Thanks Reddit!
I also nominate Ankh-Morpork--- controlled chaos with 4 players, but with two you can get really manipulative.

Arkham Horror LCG would fit the bill for me if they had an entire campaign in the box. It almost feels like paying $40 for a teaser. 
I don't know a lot of good couple games, but **...and then we held hands** is my fiance and I's favorite "couple" game to play together.

As someone with an SO that has OCD that last comment is always so annoying as it perpetuates a wrong stereotype and makes light of a condition that is really difficult to live with. OCD is nothing like Monk on TV. It's closer to Jack Nicholson in As Good as it Gets. 
Rivals for Catan! So much fun!
**Grand Austria Hotel** is another good one. It actually plays smoother with 2 players than it does with 3-4.
**Cube Quest** was put on a back burner a while ago and forgotten. Looking at it again I kind of want to go out and buy it/ ask for it for Christmas. 
Sherlock looks really fun and interesting, but I'm a bit...upset that the game only comes with a limited amount of cases. Can anyone convince me otherwise?
Good stuff. Fun channel too. Sub'd
**Seasons** is my favorite 2p game with my fiancee. Card drafting and combos scratch my itch for summoning cards like MTG.
Haven't watched, but my list

Patchwork.   
Jaipur.   
7 Wonders Duel.   
Star Realms.    
Ashes Rise of the Phoenixborn 
I'll throw in Forbidden Island and Forbidden Desert as well.  Great for team building and freaking out over how close you are to constantly losing.
Dominion is by far the best two player game we have played. 
**Bruges**. I just played it a couple of times with my so this last week and we really like the clever card play. Also the art is gorgeous. It's actually one of the only games she requests to play along with **Akrotiri**. We have still to try my copy of **Targi**.
Race for the Galaxy for the 4 dudes playing until 4 a.m. situation, Say Anything, Codenames, or Telestrations for the the 12 howling friends.

I feel like if your board game collection is going to be small or grow very slowly, a game with strong replayability like Race for the Galaxy is perfect.

7 Wonders/Suishi Go Party are very fun as well if you can get the same group of people playing it enough to develop a metagame. I've not managed to do so with the former, so I'm not in love with it.
I picked up Pandemic with OtB expansion, it's waiting for me at home :D Is Carcassonne really that good of a deal at 22$ ? I really like tile laying/build your own maps kind of games..
Same here. Have a relatively small collection that I'm looking to add to but I'm gonna wait till Friday to make my purchases
We just recently discovered **Schotten-Totten**. There's also an alternate themed version called **Battle Line**. Great 2p strategy game that's not as well known. Or at least, it wasn't to us.

Note: not kinky, unless kilts are your thing. No judgment.
**The Ravens of Thri Sahashri**
None of the recommendations below will come as any surprise to the seasoned gamer. But based on what you consider "on the radar", I think it might be relevant.



Below are a few recommendations that are the "classic" (or at least modern classic) 2-player recommendations that will ensure you both have a ton of fun without overwhelming you.



• **Jaipur** - A fantastic card game that has you and your opponent trying to make smart trades to create efficient "sets" of commodities that can then be sold for a premium. Great fun and a modern classic!



• **Hive** - Two-player games tend to veer towards the "abstract" end of the spectrum (i.e.: without much of a theme), and this game stands tall among the others in the genre. A lot of people refer to it as "insect chess", but don't let that scare you away. This is a fantastic strategic tile laying game that is well-regarded by many gamers.



• **Pandemic** - It isn't two player only (plays up to 4), but is the quintessential "cooperative" game. You think competing is fun? Try working together to rid the world of nasty diseases.



• **Battle Line**- Simple, yet deeply strategic. This is one of the greatest two-player games ever made by one of the greatest board game designers - Reiner Knizia. You are competing with your opponent to make poker-like sets of cards to claim flags on the battle line. So elegant and so good. This was originally released as **Schotten Totten** and that original theme was recently re-released.



Hope that helps. Let us know what you finally decided to play/buy and how you enjoyed the games. Have fun!
Quantum. 

My wife and I love this game. Really can't speak highly enough of it. Got me into the whole hobby and every time I go back to it I am amazed at the elegance of its design. Get it and you won't regret it. 
"and then we held hands", granted I have not yet payed it, my copy is still on route. But the game "simulates" a relationship with the other player, and you have to manage your emotions, and help make moves available for the other player, depending on what cards you have. But, you may not talk about the game to the other player, so you have to try see what they are doing or thinking, but you can not talk about anything game related.

I read its to "show" how we talk about everything, but not really our problems, and whats worrying us.

Again, this is my understanding of the game before having actually played it. The game is only for 2 players.
Might help if we knew what you considered "on the radar"
**Duel of Ages II** is worth a peek.
It's not exactly off the radar for this sub, but Jaipur and Patchwork are pretty great 2p-only games.

We also love playing Time Stories and Seasons together!
**Mage Knight** or **18EA**. They both have sex versions too. 
On the radar at least for this sub but Patchwork as mentioned, 7 Wonders Duel, Agricola All Creatures Great and Small
TL;DR - 

* **Catan Junior**
* **Ticket to Ride: First Journey**
* **Clank!**
* **Mice & Mystics**
Apparently I need to look into Clank for my kids, keep hearing about it...
Pretty sure Celestia is what you are looking for, just played this :)

/u/r2d8 getinfo
Sounds like [Celestia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175117/celestia) 
Well, you already got your answer.

I just dropped by to say that I liked how you summarised the rules of the game.
The one and only Meetup.com meet up I went to I played with a guy who licked his fingers so he could get a grip on on the 7 Wonders cards before dealing. Pretty gross habit, doubly so because it wasn't even his game.
Don't even need to be a con, just a large group. One person is sick and soon everyone else gets it. 
Seeing as I've been in a few Games Workshops that smell like hockey rink locker rooms, I feel that many in the hobby have issues with hygiene. Heck didn't dice tower (I think, or was it someone else?) put out some con etiquette videos a couple years back, and one was "take regular showers!"  
Attended a local con two weekends ago. Over the duration, I must have seen a dozen men head straight from the urinals to the game floor as I washed my hands like some kinda germaphobe. 

Noticing this definitely makes me want to play Purell Police immediately prior to running any games in the future. 
Got it. Don't go to cons anymore. Burn all clothes I ever wore to one. Thanks! Going to go vomit.
Just one thing, if nose blower used a kleenex and hand sanitizer what else could he have done? Most people can't avoid being sick at will... 
Thanks for the clickbait headline. That's great.
Not touching your face / mouth is important... I work in the infectious disease division of a public health department and I still see people rubbing their face/ adjusting their hair after working with pathogens, or not washing their hands in the bathroom. It's incredible. 

For the record purel does next to nothing and is no substitute for washing your hands. Best bet is to not eat, drink or touch your face after handling common games until you wash your hands. 
This seems to be an issue at any large public or semi-public event. Conventions, cruises, concerts etc. There are just too many people who completely neglect hygiene and/or don't change their habits when they get sick.

I think it's an issue of upbringing for a lot of people. I know personally that I didn't have very good hygiene either until after I lived with a woman for a while. She straightened that crap out pretty quick and I haven't looked back XD
Thanks buzzfeed dad.
That's disgusting 
I believe hand sanitizer would merely select for the bacteria that are resistant and thus help create an illness that is no longer affected by your attempts to kill it.  Alternatively, they may be viruses and thus the sanitizer is like hiding behind a toilet paper display when someone is shooting a nuke at you.  Then there is the possibility that there is no illness at all but it is just the natural bodily reaction to the changing season (sinuses swell, going from cold to warm makes noses runny, etc) so it is like going to your corner grocery store in a tank because someone my try to shoot you.

Okay, I get it, you are really grossed out by the average habits of human beings and the prevalent nature of our human sliminess.  However, I'm going to offer you a more proactive solution over demanding everyone change and do it your way - bring disposable cotton gloves.  Use them for a game day to avoid contact with all the nasty bits and then dispose of them.  Wash your hands before putting them on and after taking them off - and my "wash your hands" that means lather and rub for a bit, make sure to do under the nails/between fingers/both sides of the hand, and go up the forearm a bit - *not* the put the soap in your hand, rub your palms, and rinse method that I see so few do (as so many don't wash their hands at all... eeeew).  Also, shower right away and take advantage of any laundry services you have access to (ie, wash those germ covered clothes right away, don't put them in a festering bag or suitcase of "to do when I get home").  [Source: My wife is an EMT.  One time she was doing clinicals in at a hospital when a man had loose stools leak everywhere - she came home and threw her clothes in the washer and immediately double scrubbed in a shower.  Another time she had a call with a sick patient, and she came home and washed her clothes and showered again.  Her fellow volunteers didn't - guess which ones got sick and which one didn't.  Also, as an EMT - gloves, don't touch your face, eye coverage and/or face masks, and learning how to remove gloves without touching the exteriours are all good habit skills to learn... the EMT needs to protect themselves rather than expect an ill patient to protect them.]

Listen, I worked in the restaurant industry and I know how hard it is for people to avoid their subconscious grooming behaviors.  Unless you work in an industry where you could harm yourself or others by touching your face and hair, you'll probably not understand just how strong the human impulse to groom is (because you'll just do it).  Even if you get 99% compliance, you'll still have sickness spread.  If you don't want to get sick, learn how to protect yourself rather than come up with requirements that others have to do.  For example, I wash my hands in a public restroom and then use the paper towel to grab the door handle.  Why?  As I said, most people don't wash their hands - fortunately most that defecate do.  Alas, I said most and not all... and as I noted earlier, the vast majority that do don't know how to properly wash their hands.  Far too many merely rinse water over their hands, and so many fail to scrub properly.  I take it upon myself to protect me from their germs, because the average person is just too oblivious to what they are doing wrong.

Oh, and if you're flying, well... probably no reason to bother protecting yourself when you're put in a metal tube with a small closed air system circulating the diseases around and around and around.  You're getting sick if you don't take any precautions beyond santizing your hands... but hey, bright side: you're building up a great immune system if you don't die!
Yeah, I've seen that behavior before at local meetups. We carry around bottles of hand sanitizer to cons anymore for this reason. I think, in general, that people are less aware of their actions than they perceive.

And that is how con flu spreads...
I've never played with strangers and now I feel discouraged of doing it.
Reminds me of the reports of people getting ocular herpes from sampling VR headsets at video game shows.
Have you considered the [Swimming in Raw Sewage Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnmMNdiCz_s)?
And my problem is that I have a nervous tic cough, especially when I'm in an intense situation or have had a bit too much caffeine. Have to explain to every single person that I'm not recklessly spreading a cold around, and yet understandably some people's can't get that conscious information to their subconscious germ avoidance systems, which is a bummer for both of us.

- hand wipes
- hand sanitiser 


I just came from a con and yep - got the sickness from the demo stations. I carry a travel hand sanitizer with me.
I've only been to 2 board game cons. Got sick at both :(.

Use the gel people!
My wife and I run a board game night at a local teen center. Some of the younger kids are still nail-biters, nose-pickers, etc. We're largely bringing in our own games. I WILL call out a kid who's doing something unsanitary, ask them to go wash their hands, and then explain WHY I'm asking them to do it.
You are not alone. I find myself not enjoying some of the games with my group at home when I spend all night watching out for potential drink spills and dirty hands :(
On a side note; and another thread I ranted before:

Nerds, Geeks, Enthusiast, whatever you want to call yourself - clean up. There is no reason for you to reek. There is no reason for you to be gross. Be considerate to other people's things. And further more, Store Owners of FLGS - just because your clients are often this nerd types don't let your store fall into it. 
I know there are good people in the world, but this is why I fear going to board game meetups...I guess I don't offer to bring my own?
>Or at least keep your hands away from your mouth while playing. 

Used to play with a guy who would constantly put the pieces in his mouth. Really nice guy... just became totally oblivious when he was in deep-thought mode. 

>Shortly after a lady who was taking the demo was sniffling and obviously a bit sick. She coughed into her hand and then touched the cards. 

Yea, that pisses me off a bit. Now, I know conventions have a fairly high time/money cost for most people... but if you are sick, at least wear a mask. 


Good prevention - hand sanitizer and *don't touch your face*. Ever.
It is indeed another factor of hygiene that transcends the stereotypes one may normally expect.  Being aware of what you touch, where you touch, etc helps especially in environments like board gaming as well as children.  I fear when/if my kid doesn't have the cognizance required and gives me pink-eye :|
This! It feels like I have been waiting for this kind of video for the past few years - not only for gaming, but other inclusive things.

Let me split my comment into two parts:

1.INCLUSUION

Most of 'let's make women/minorities feel special' talks make me sick - in part because I had more than a few experiences of being a minority under various circumstances and in different countries. I really want to bring Sam's throatpunch magic to those 'self proclaimed holy warriors of justice'.

At the same time Suzanne and Mandi are the first people in a while I see talking about *NOT BEING SPECIAL, BUT NORMAL* - that's what is important and crucial. Singling people out or making huge signs of 'N are *especially* welcomed* just builds a wall, enforces insecurity and creates a complex for people, so the next time some N will get in a conflict, first thing will be about N being N, not actions from or towards that person.

Also, Suzanne made a great point - by going to those conventions and openly enjoying the hobby she did much more than all those shouting illustrious 'protectors'.

So yeah, I personally hate on those people carving for brownie points for being 'liberal', but my, do I respect and like Suzanne even more now.
And you know what I personally do? I try to bring all of my friends and peers into hobby: kids, older folks, male, female - doesn't matter - we all could enjoy the game. And for me it actually makes for 50/50 distribution without any intent. If somebody has only male/female/whatever-single-kind-of-people as friends - I think that's the problem, not gaming or community.

2.REPRESENTATION

Yes! Yes! Yes!

They nailed it perfectly here - WHEN IT MAKES SENSE.

And now because we should have more females or bearded fat guys or whatever else - but because *FAIR REPRESENTATION MAKES FOR BETTER, RICHER EXPERIENCE* in games.

I want to see people of Middle Ages Europe in games about Middle Ages Europe. I want to see African Tribesmen of 15th century in games about African tribesmen in 15th century.

And you know what - I want to see more there, to learn more, to get more from those games:
* add a merchant from Middle East or Central Asia to Europe - they were there!
* Add Chinese explorers to Africa - they were there! And since it's not a very common knowledge - tell me why and how - it could make for a much funnier and interesting experience for everyone.

---
It was a great talk, thank you, Suzanne and Mandi - I think you managed what most people can't - leave out all politics and show how to make life better and cozier for everyone.
Inclusiveness as a personal trait is fantastic. I think the world is a better place when more people are kind and welcoming.

As an ideology/movement/cause, I'm less clear about the specific goals. For instance, is it desirable to have an even 50/50 gender split in gaming, and how do you go about achieving such a balance? 

I am constantly trying, perhaps stupidly but at least with a sense of hope, to get people to play wargames. My success rate for male gamers is maybe a couple percent, but my success rate for female gamers is exactly 0. 

If anybody knows wargamers then they know that it is far more homogeneous than the general gaming population. What else can I do to try and get women to play wargamers then constantly invite them to do so, despite getting nothing but laughter and bewilderment in return?

It may not be a cheery thought, but I think it helps to keep in mind how naturally tribal and exclusionary human beings can be. I have no doubt that it's more difficult for women and minorities to navigate these waters, but I think a variant of Hanlon's Razor applies here. Even as the all-powerful white male, I don't walk into new groups, especially groups of nerds, and have the red carpet rolled out for me. It usually takes months of constantly showing my face and forcing interactions for people to even remember my name and to begin treating me as anything but wallpaper.

Regarding representation - I think variety is great but I find that the cultural appropriation taboo has created a bit of a Catch-22. I used to write a lot more in my younger days and I was keenly aware of the dangers of writing female or minorities characters poorly. If I botched a white male character, it would just be a sign of ineptitude. If I botched a minority character, it could be seen as an attack. 

I find it counterproductive to want a diversity in artistic representation but then allow people only the right of autobiography. Still, I accept the way the world works and I suggest that the solution is to get more female and minority designers, publishers, and artists so they can represent themselves as they choose.
I understand wanting to be inclusive, and I would never turn a woman away (or anyone) from a game. But could the problem be as simple as the overall makeup of gamers isn't 50/50?

Maybe there are just more men in the hobby, and that's that?

if I went to a convention about fishing and tackle, would I be upset if it was mostly guys and there were no women?

Or better yet, if I went to a trade show about knitting or scrap booking, would I be mad that it's mostly women?

None of these hobbies should be exclusive to one gender or the other, but sometimes that just happens. Why do my daughters play with barbies and not transformers?

Also, in the YouTube comments, someone said something about going to game stores and not seeing any women, and therefore not feeling welcome. Someone, unfortunately, has to make the first step. There can't be all women gamers saying "there are no women playing at game stores, so I don't go play"

I think people should definitely be welcoming to new players no matter what gender, race, etc. they are, but I'm not sure that the hobby will be a 50/50 split any time soon. 
Could you imagine if every "WSIG Euros" thread devolved in to people saying they are sick of hearing about euros and that people who like euros should stop talking about them? For the most part, I think the majority of the people in this community would just skip over that thread if they didn't like euro games.

This was an interesting video and it was great to hear discussion and perspectives from these two presenters. I don't often watch their segments but I'll be happy to give them a go in the future.
I thought these speakers (and these comments) handled this topic well.  For the first time in a long time this topic is actually about equality instead of superiority.  I really hate joining in on these conversations because it's always about how as a straight white male I ruin everything, but this one is different.  Progress!

I want everyone to have as much fun in my hobbies as I do.  Bring on more new gamers!  If you're nice, cool, and hygienic (and live nearby) you're always welcome at my table.  More gamers = more designers = more games = more variety.  
In the spirit of this video I wish to engage in a dialogue.  Please remember this is not a judgement, but questions to help with self-awareness and provide introspection - and also your answers will help me reflect better on viewpoints.

1. Do women in gaming truly feel that these types of judgements and actions are exclusive to them or only to non-{white heterosexual male} gamers?

2. If you are a minority gamer, do you ever feel like you are stereotyping all {white heterosexual males} as heavily biased and exclusive?

3. Do you think only non-{white heterosexual gamers} are the only ones to feel like they are first being judged by their appearance and then viewed as incompetent in gaming?

4. Should conventions be the one held responsible if non-{white heterosexual gamers} don't buy tickets or show up?

*******

Okay, now to talk about my experiences as a white heterosexual gamer.  All my life I have been the odd one, the outsider, the picked on new kid, or the geek/nerd.  I have had gangs of boys chase after me on their bikes yelling about how they were going to beat me up, I've been shot in my ass with a BB gun by another boy, I was mocked and teased because I played often with girls and with people of all ages, and I was teased for the types of toys and games I played.  In the 80s I got into the tabletop RPG scene, and it provided me an outlet where other "outcasts" like me felt accepted and welcomed.

My board gaming history began in the 80s with family gaming, which means I played with 2 sisters and occasionally my mother (my father didn't like to play board games).  In the 90s my girlfriend, her sister's boyfriend, and some people I met by going to an RPG college club became my gaming group.  I will say, it was pretty much dominated by very nerdy and socially outcast white heterosexual males.  One was very tall and heavy, one was very tall and light, eventually there was the abused child who seemed to be suffering PTSD and always needed to play the tough lone wolf character who bordered on evil, and there was the stoner "surfer" guy who was a chill hippy type.  None of us were really socially acceptable, expecially when the sister's boyfriend first got into anime and then eventually became a 'Japanophile' who married a Japanese woman and moved overseas (and I assume he is still there to this day).  None of us felt comfortable walking into a room and all of us white male heterosexuals felt like we were constantly judged.

In the 2000s I met my wife, and after failing to get back into tabletop RPGs (as 1-on-1 after a few years hiatus was too difficult, especially since she wasn't comfortable with the idea of roleplaying) we eventually settled on boardgames.  We mainly played with her family or with just the two of us.

About a year and a half ago we approached several people to try out a pnp review copy of Foragers.  Two people we asked came by later that evening and said they would be glad to come and try it a few days later, and we've been meeting with about once a week on average since.  When we play at our FLGS on game nights, we gladly play with others when we have room (or when they have room).  However, to this day I still suffer "approach anxiety" and have an extremely difficult time feeling like I'm not being judged.

Do you people remember terms like Neckbeard or Grognard?  Those are derogatory terms I've heard many white heterosexual male gamers called, and not in a kind way.  We *all* suffer judgement, especially many of us who gravitate to the fantasy worlds of tabletop gaming.

So lets get to the video...

One thing mentioned was being approached and assumed to know something.  Several times I have been in a chain store wearing the same color shirt as employees and had customers approach me like an employee.  Being judged by appearance happens to us all.  It is not exclusive to "minority" gamers.

Another is having a player tell you what the "right move" is - throughout the years I've encountered and been at the receiving end of this gamer.  I think it is important that it was mentioned the other *people* at the table weren't talking that way or being talked at that way.  This means that at least 2 out of 3 people were *not* telling her what the right move was, but it felt like the accusation was she was being judged by ethnicity and gender at the table.  It was that one asshole gamer who did that, not the majority of the hobbyists.

I found representation arguments to be the same old mantra.  I believe they mentioned the lack of women and the "historical excuse" - but I am a 'historical purist'.  When I play a civil war game, I don't want an Asian female Grant or black transgender Lee in the game.  Of course, when I play a medieval fantasy game I want a bit of realism too, so I want women in realistic armor (ie, no bikinis and no boob chest plate armor).  However, I am a heterosexual male, so I don't dislike such art - just as I've encountered women who didn't mind the unrealistic barbarian physique and armor set put forth by Conan-like barbarian tropes.  Also, where is the anger about having anti-intellectual drunkard barbarian males with unrealistic physiques?

What I did find disturbing was they liked to put the shoe on the other foot.  They have issues with games being designed with all white male characters, but have no issues with exclusiveness in games with all black or all female characters?  I tend to gravitate to games that don't represent the player and are abstracted (Castles of Burgundy, Ora Et Labora, Roads & Boats, Agricola, Porta Nigra, Seeland, Extra! Extra!, Puerto Rico, San Juan, and so many more) or are historical representations.  However, I do appreciated games that give players the choice of player color and gender when there are representations, like Legends of Andor with its male and female side.  Would I buy a game that was driven in price for having various ethnicities represented with each character gender card also?  I don't think so.

As to constant questioning during rules, I do it occasionally due to projection.  I tend to over-emphasize those things I struggled with and skim over the bits I got quickly.  Additionally, I tend to interact with those who put forth an effort to be attentive and try to be established in the social exchange.  I'm going to stereotype a bit, but do you want to guess who tends to be more attentive and socially interactive?  Women.  Its like the old joke that men won't ask for directions when lost - well, they don't ask for clarifications either.  Then, as always, when someone explains rules to me I get things very wrong because I misunderstand them... so I assume other people are horrible auditory learners like me.

Finally, I've never been to a convention - but I've watched videos of them.  Some conventions suffer from the same problem as wargaming, and that is either 1) diverse populations don't seem to be drawn to that subgenre (perhaps because the simulationist nature of it is not inclusive or because they view history as a biased source that is irreconcilable) or 2) because they don't feel like they'd find other like them, so they stay home ensuring that others like them won't be there.  (Its a chicken and egg problem - when you don't go because you never see anyone like you there then you create the environment where people like you aren't there, so people like you don't see people like you and they choose to not go... and it becomes a feedback loop or 'self fulfilling prophecy', and if you just all went then there would be people like you and that would encourage other people like you to go... get it?)  I hardly think saying the hobby is not inclusive is fair when so many make an assumption about it being not inclusive and don't go.  Okay, I have no hard proof of this - I only base it on what I've seen in posts, articles, and videos about inclusiveness and why people avoid certain environments.

So the TL;DR?  My experience has been exclusion is not exclusive to the "minority" segment of gamers.  We've all been judged, we all feel judged, we all have had the player who tells us what to do, we've all gone into a room and felt there was no one like us, and we all want to feel included.  Putting the shoe on the other foot is not inclusiveness, but also not everything needs to be inclusive.  Look at how heavily inclusive this hobby is rather than focusing on the negative examples.  Realize just how inclusive this hobby is.

The above was my contribution to the discussion.  I am sure there will be those who disagree with me, so hopefully this will be the start of a civil discourse on inclusiveness.  As the two hosts of our show suggested, this is not a negative judgement but a "calling out" of something I think those on the other side of this debate may have overlooked.  After reading my comments, watch the video a second or third time, then come back and read my question and maybe my comments again.  Then put forth your part of the discussion, and I'll try to get back and read them... but I have a game night tomorrow, so it may be a while before I get back.
I have to comment because I've been involved in these arguments surrounding "inclusiveness" a lot and if this was what inclusive gaming was about then there would be nothing to argue. Adding more people and improving your social competence is only positive.

This is in stark contrast to how most males approach the subject. Mandi and Suzanne provide great examples and food for thought without judging people for what their taste is like. They don't talk down to women who cosplay in revealing costumes or about "perverted" artists (who could be male or female).

One thing I would add that they kind of leave off the table is how some women view male nerds. This isn't just a Hollywood stereotype, but there are women who avoid gaming events like the plague because they don't want to be associated with low status men. You will simply never get a 50-50 representation in the hobby while that stigma exists.
"I was reading a book (about interjections, oddly enough) yesterday which included the phrase 'In these days of political correctness…' talking about no longer making jokes that denigrated people for their culture or for the colour of their skin. And I thought, 'That’s not actually anything to do with "political correctness." That’s just treating other people with respect.'

"Which made me oddly happy. I started imagining a world in which we replaced the phrase 'politically correct' wherever we could with 'treating other people with respect', and it made me smile. 

"You should try it. It’s peculiarly enlightening.

"I know what you’re thinking now. You’re thinking 'Oh my god, that’s treating other people with respect gone **mad**!'"

-- Neil Gaiman
Video's been online for an hour and it has 47 dislikes on Youtube

but remember, there's no inclusiveness problem in board gaming.

(for comparison, the next highest amount of dislikes on a BackTalk video is [this one with 26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzlchEetffQ) which has been up since May 6th, and the highest after that is 12)
Sad that this is still such a controversial  topic. Yes it's a community problem and yes we perpetuate it. 

The fact that there's always this pushback is proof of concept for why I game at home. I love the games but can't stand the constant invalidation and identity targeted microagressions.
So glad to see this conversation happening. It makes me very sad when I've been to events and almost everyone is male. Puts my girlfriend off coming along (which I'm sure is why many people don't go as well).

The biggest thing that excites me about better diversity in games is that it will mean we get a more interesting range of games designers who come from all kinds of backgrounds with all kinds of ideas. There is still so much untapped potential in tabletop still.
Another one of these?  Just "starting a conversation"?  But no, this still does nothing to sell me on this concept's legitimacy, value, or necessity.  I don't want to hear another sales pitch about it.

We're interested in games.  Bringing social issues here you can expect the internet version of the response that telemarketers, door to door salespeople, and religious solicitors get.  Think about that.  Because that's what you're doing.

"hello, what were you doing?  talking about games? oh that's nice, have you accepted jesus christ as your personal savior??"

That's what I think of social justice warriors.  You may think it's really important.  You may think you have "the secret to eternal life" but not everyone agrees, many are not interested, and people will have different ways of telling you.  Some will not be nice.

I'm hoping this thread can be closed because this has come up yet again and i really don't think this is the place for it.
Maybe men just like puzzles more.
Stop these videos and these PSA's please. STOP.

People are going to be people. If I don't want to be inclusive, then that's what I'm going to do. I don't want to make an extra effort to cater to one particular group of people more than another. And I'm not an asshole for doing that. I just don't care. I go to game nights. I am polite and friendly. I play the games. I go home. I'm not some raging racist or misogynist. I just want to come, play games and go home.

If someone comes through the door, I'll say hello and ask them to play at my table. It has nothing to do with inclusion. I am simply asking them to play because I want people to play against. They could be a man or a women, white or not, old or young; I don't care. **Not being inclusive is different than being actively exclusive. Please remember this.**

I am just sick and tired of these trends that are saying that they are these mysterious forces preventing women and racial minorities from playing games. Nobody is standing at the door and barring anyone from entering and playing games. When you come in, you introduce yourself and hopefully get a table going. This applies to anyone.

And as far as gaming being white and male goes. Let me give you a math lesson: gaming is mostly a male hobby. It is that way because it's been that way throughout history. Men are usually in competitions and such and board games are just one branch of that. As far as white people in the hobby goes, Caucasian people make up at least 77.35% of the people in America (2014 Census). That's about 8 in 10 Americans. In most ANY HOBBY you will have a majority of white people because IT'S MATH. Gaming is a hobby that is mostly men. So when you enter a game store and see white men gaming... IT'S MATH, not discrimination.

It's actually a bit ironic that there is so much push for female gamers in the hobby when you should really push for more racial diversity as the need is greater considering 8 in 10 Americans are white.

So before this topic goes anywhere EVERYONE including those social justice fighters, need to sit down and absorb the facts which are that gaming is mostly male because it has been historically and that most people in America are white.

The second thing is that if people AREN'T inclusive, they aren't bad people. They may simply not care enough to do anything about it or could be lazy. And that's fine. If I see a can on the ground and I walk past it, I am not the one that littered; I am simply a bystander. 

The real culprits are the ones that are exclusionary as in the ones that say no women or minorities allowed or treat them worse. And in this case, I will agree and say it's wrong and that people could call that person out and support the person being wronged.

But to get in my face and tell me to be inclusive... that's really pandering and no, I do not need to be reminded of that. It's really pointless as well because they racists and sexists won't listen to that anyway and the decent people ALREADY know this. It's like telling an adult to wipe their butt after they flush and saying good boy and giving them a treat.

And the other thing is that assholes can come in all shapes and sizes. There can be women that are terrible people. There can be minorities that are terrible people. There can be white men that are victims. We need to be open minded and not assume a person's innocence by their race or gender.

And as far as Conan, power fantasies and male gaze go, what a load of turd. Yes, most men would like to be with a gorgeous woman, but not every guy would want to be Conan. Women have their fantasies as well. You know those Disney movies? You know the one where the poor girl ends up being a princess and lives happily ever after with her prince? Is this not a fantasy as well? The girls and women that watch these movies do not identify with characters like Ursula, Cruella de Vil or the Queen of Hearts; they identify with the heroine who always happen to be young, attractive and innocent. They learn from an early age that attractiveness = good and ugliness = bad.

And how about them romance novels? People love to talk about how women are objectified, but what is going on here?

http://www.reellifewithjane.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/romance-novels.jpg

Only women can be objectified? This cover doesn't even have a face, it's simply a torso!

http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/6600000/Victoria-Alexander-romance-novels-6683766-1140-969.jpg

The strangest thing is that these pictures aren't all that different from Conan. So you have this huge backlash against Conan and how men like seeing sexy women, yet the same people seem to ignore that men are being objectified in novels such as these where they are in some cases, walking torsos. The double standards are real.
Dice Tower can wax poetic on inclusiveness and virtue signal all they want. At the end of the day, the main paid employees of the dice tower are 4 men. Three are in front of the camera during every main review and top 10 list, and 1 is a full time editor/behind the scenes person. Getting more women as bit contributors to a once a week show doesn't change that 95% of the videos on the channel are entirely male in content and contribution.
If you get a Pandemic game, definitely go for Legacy. You can practice on the pristine board a few times before you jump in. If you're interested in Legacy like that, you'll be wasting money to buy the vanilla Pandemic game. I wouldn't worry too much about the disease bit for Pandemic. You're trying to help the world get cured (though if you *want* to do the opposite, there's a Pandemic game for that, too...)

If you have another couple to play with, T.I,M.E. Stories is another good one to look into. You CAN do it with just two people, but it's not really recommended by most people.

Beyond that, a lot of games have campaigns that you can play through. Mice & Mystics is one that seems to get good reviews. The D&D board games also seem to have campaign scenarios, but there's not really much story to those. Dead of Winter is semi-coop (pure co-op is basically mandatory at 2p, and possible at any player count if you leave out the secret objective cards) about surviving a zombie apocalypse, and there are a bunch of main objective cards to play through, with flavor story/variance via the Crossroads and Crisis decks. Legends of Andor is another, but it's more of a puzzly type game, and less RPG/adventure as it looks.

If you want to play games based on history, there is Black Orchestra, where you play members of the Nazi party who plot to assassinate Hitler, or Freedom: The Underground Railroad, where you traffic slaves into Canada.

Oh yeah, a great co-op (not really story-based, though) is Beyond Baker Street. It's like Hanabi, but is said to play much better with 2 players, and goes up to 4 players, and it has some theme to it. I love it as a 2p game! And that also makes me remember... Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective! It doesn't get much more story-driven than what is essentially a map, newspapers, and books! And if you like Lovecraft, there's Mythos Tales which is the same game style with a Cthulhu theme.

So many options out there!
Out of curiosity, why are you unsure about the theme of Pandemic? Are you looking for something a little less "real-life"? Are you squeamish about germs? Are you worried that "We found a cure for a disease" won't feel as epic as "We saved the world from the meteor"? Because Pandemic Legacy *is* a great game, and it *does* feel epic, but I can understand if the theme actively makes you feel ill that you may not want to play it.

I have heard that **Defenders of the Realm** is close to being Pandemic with a high fantasy theme (but is maybe not as good?).

**Ghost Stories** is a brutally unforgiving co-op about being kung fu monks fighting a demon lord and his army of ghosts.

**Forbidden Island** and **Forbidden Desert** are entry-level games by the designer of Pandemic that involve finding relics on an island/in the desert and then trying to escape.

Speaking of which, **Escape: The Curse of the Temple** is a real-time dice rolling co-op that has you playing as Indiana Clones (see what I did there?) trying to do the thing that it says in the name of the game. It has a couple of big expansions and a gajillion mini expansions if you want to change the game up.

**Flash Point: Fire Rescue** is about being firemen. Run into the building, try to keep the fire contained, rescue the dog, get caught in the blast when a gas canister explodes. It has a gajillion mini expansions if you want to change the game up.

Or, if you want to try a game that's essentially Pandemic but with a different theme, there's **Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu**, because of course there is.

Those are the main ones I can suggest or recommend myself, besides **Hanabi** which is a brain melter with a mostly forgettable theme.
[Race to the Rhine](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148601/1944-race-rhine) is a ww2 game about logistics and resource management
Odd consideration, a war themed game with no conflict. I'm interested to see what people propose. Maybe check out **The Grizzled**?
You might like Imperial.  It is a little before WW1, but it is essentially the lead up to that war.
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24181/imperial

Also, Quartermaster General for WWII: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/159473/quartermaster-general


**Scythe** is a bit hard to find at the moment, but it fits somewhat with what you're looking for.  There is some player conflict, but it's not the focus of the game, which tends to involve resource management and engine building.  It's a bit of a steampunk/fantasy take on Eastern Europe immediately following WWI (~1920 or so), so it's not really set in the historical WWI... but it might be worth a look.

**City of Spies: Estoril 1942** has a WWII theme, as it's set in Portugal in 1942.  You're trying to build up a spy organization for the various world powers, placing agents at different locations in the city.  It's more of an area control game than one which deals with resource management and engine building, but there is a light deck-building mechanic which you might find interesting.

**Popular Front** isn't all that well-known, but it's a Euro-style wargame with hand-management mechanics.  There *is* direct player conflict in this one, though, so it might not be what you're looking for, but it seems to focus as much on logistics and political influence as it does on troop movement.  I haven't played it, but it's gotten some decent reviews.
I guess thinking about it, something like Nations or Through the Ages has war in it and you have to manage resources to support armies and stuff. But I guess i'm looking for more granular engine building and resource management.
In [Wings for the Baron](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/184866/wings-baron-second-edition) players are German airplane manufacturers in WW1. I haven't played it, but I've heard good things.
>WW1/WW2
>No conflict between players.
>Wat
I've been working on a game for the last several years that sounds pretty similar to what you're looking for.  It's called [No Soldier Left Behind](http://nosoldierleftbehindgame.com), where you play individual soldiers trying to complete missions during the Battle of the Bulge.

Several of the missions are about things other than just straight-up combat.  For instance, one scenario has you playing two medics rushing through the ruins of Bastogne to save wounded soldiers.

It's got some Eurogame-like mechanics in it, like a modular board and light resource management elements.  It doesn't really have any engine building like in *Dominion* and games like that, but it does have some card-pulling strategy elements that make it have a similar flavor.  Each soldier has a deck of cards that you pull from for setting your available actions, for instance.

It's not available for sale yet, but hopefully soon.
Cool thanks
Wait for Black Friday, target just had 30% off on the 19th and I picked it up for forty. If it is still in stock I bet they have another blow out sale just as good or better.

ETA - also, Miniature Mart always has it for about the price you listed. They have kept it at that price for a long time while everyone else raised theirs.
If you want new, that seems like the lowest price I've seen. On the other hand, I was just about to list my copy on Craigslist. Only played through once. Unfortunately I let my nephews Paint the minis bright solid colors so some people might be turned away by that. Pm me if you are interested.
I'll sale you mine it's been BARELY  played one time pm me if interested.
I am guessing you mean when will the next print run be, as this game has not gone out of print yet.............

Belfort, scoville, Manhattan project, legacy the testament of the Duke deCracy, castles of the mad king ludwig, Mexica, medina, above and below.
I recently got **Above and Below** and while I played it only twice I think it fits the bill. Tzolk'in and Kemet on the other hand haven't been received well by some of my friends; they seem to enjoy moderately complex cooperative games like **Eldritch Horror** and **Dead of Winter**.

I too have teached **Concordia** to a lot of people new to modern boardgames with great success as well as **Agricola** and **Power Grid**. With **Agricola** you can just leave out the cards and explain the basics and go on as you're playing. With **Power Grid** everyone gets it after the first round.
Also my newest purchase **Bruges** was very easy to teach to my SO last week. And then there's always classics like **Bohnanza** and other small card games.
**Abyss** is a great mid-weight game which I find pretty easy to teach. I recently taught it to my Grandmother who usually doesn't play anything heavier than *Ticket to Ride* and she didn't have any trouble learning it.
**Food Chain Magnate** is really easy to teach. But so hard to master.

**Captain Sonar**

**Chinatown**

**Scythe** 

**Lords of Vegas**

**Mysterium**

**Quantum**

**Suburbia**
I literally was looking up this exact thing the other day so I just so happen to have all of my links still open.

[4 for 20](http://www.artscow.com/photo-gifts/4-for-20) 

Until Dec 8 they have a 4 for $20 sale with free shipping.  Includes deck of cards as long as they have the same back.  If you dont need that many, might as well order extra for spares since they are not the most high quality decks.  

There is also printerstudio - will cost a little more but can get better quality cards
everyone is going to have a different opinion about Lacerda games. his games are all big heavy Euros but different mechanics and layouts mean certain gamers prefer different titles.

Personally i'm a big fan of all of them. But then i'm a super easy person who kind of likes everything! So here's a quick run down for you to make a decision:

**Gallerist** - this is just simply stunning. It's honestly, without a doubt the most gorgeous game to look at, and the component quality is second to none. The game itself is a little fiddly with lots of little rules, it's fairly hard to teach but when it comes down to it there are only 4 action spaces. The score track is a phenomenal mechanic which tracks three things with one token and you can spend points to get more actions. it really is a marvel. The overall game is great but i feel like the victory only comes down to one track to get there. ie buy more art, send more assistants to the international market.

**Kanban** - jesus, just look at that board. it literally fucks your eyes the first time you see it. BUT it's actually a genius design, all the action spaces are in a line, you move along it and so does sharon. it's so good for brain crunching working out where to go to beat your opponents or sharon. And then every section of the board is linked to the action line and to each other. you can follow the production of the car really well. The game itself is heavy. It's a brain melter once you know what's going on, but god is it confusing at first. I feel there are a lot of ways to victory here.

**Vinhos** - if you get the new deluxe version it is gorgeous again. It's heavy man. It has a shitload of rules but once you get your head round the actions spaces then it all kind of comes together. Yeah it's hard to teach, it's also a pretty hard to master game too. You are juggling balls all over the damn shop and your decisions really make an impact each turn. But it's so rewarding when you get it right.

Conclusion...buy them all. I honestly couldn't put one better than the other. they are all great games and there has never been a time that i have said no to any of them over the others.

EDIT - actually, after reading that it isn't very helpful. sorry! they are all just really good. so if i absolutely had to pick one then i would probably go for Gallerist. It's so stunning that it pips the others just so slightly.
Don't forget about **CO2** if you like Vital's games.
I think if you could have only one I would go for **The Gallerist** it's a beautiful work of art with a lot of depth while being one of Lacerda "simple" games! I think it's a nice introduction to his other games.

Edit: I just don't own CO2 bc there's rumor of a reprint in 2017 but i played them all
I haven't yet played Vinhos but between Kanban and The Gallerist I would give a slight edge to Kanban. It's a little tighter and more competitive and the slew of different goals and milestones gives the game good variability. I think it also scales better, it plays relatively quickly and is good with more players without bloating in playtime while I think The Gallerist would drag too much with 3-4 players. The Gallerist is also excellent and the bumping and boosting fame of artists give the game some 'nice' interaction so it feels less confrontational.
I simply adore The Gallerist. With that said I have not played any of his others but I am also intrigued by Lisboa. 
Played **CO2** last weekend and it was a fun game. Enjoyed the theme and its typical Vital.  
I have Agricola and Food Chain Magnate, both love them, and I went with The Gallerist as my first Lacerda game. It's gorgeous, the theme is unlike anything I've seen in a board game and it's a real brain burner. Also, it's readily available. Couldn't go wrong in my opinion. 
Sold The Gallerist not too long ago. It wasn't a big with my SO and, while I enjoyed it, it didn't leave a huge impact compared to the time it taught to play and set up.

Now we have Vinhos Deluxe. I love this game! It's so rich and deep, with so many fun and cool decisions to make. The art is gorgeous (true for the Gallerist as well). It's just a lot of fun to play, even if the rules can be a bit daunting at first. However, i actually think the rules were easier to digest than for the Gallerist... 
Obviously as a board gamer my original conclusion was to buy them all.

Then reality and knowing my wife's likely reaction to the size of the parcel and outlay made me realise one would have to do :)

Thanks for the advice so far!
I have played vinhos deluxe, the gallerist, and lisboa (all on tabletopia, and I can invite people to games if they want to figure out this decision by trying out the games themselves), and I think lisboa might just be one of the best board games I have played (~1000 unique board games played for scale). It quickly hit my top 5. I think that Rahdo's description of this game as a sandbox is not quite accurate. When I think of sandbox games, I think of games that let you do whatever you want with very little direction, whereas in this game you really need to be involved in every aspect of the game to perform well. All the different areas of the board and all the mechanisms work together to create a really cohesive experience unlike many other games I have played. I think Vinhos is interesting although once you get over the beauty of the deluxe board and the simple beauty of the action selection the game can get a little dry. The Gallerist is actually my least favorite so far of Vital's games. The turn structure is very simple which is refreshing but I found the mechanisms to be fairly unintuitive leaving me with almost no idea what I should be doing. Also at the end of the game the only impact you've really made is raised the renown of artists by moving up different tracks whereas in lisboa you are rebuilding a whole city from ruin and helping the economy to grow by getting involved in international commerce and helping the government to rebuild as well all inside of a play a card, draw a card, turn structure. I think that you should get Lisboa but keep in mind all of this is my opinion and I know many will disagree (especially about the Gallerist. Maybe I need at least 3 more plays to fully understand). 
gofdoc - good old fashioned deck of cards.
I have just Extension (the first one) which includes jumps/overpass, as well as different configurations for guard rails.  I can't speak for the others, but it immensely improves the game having it.
Wits and Wagers sounds like a good fit for him as well.  Edit:  Oh, and probably Telestrations.
Spyfall, snake oil, codenames, mysterium, the resistance

Just a few thoughts. 
For a game that in Tom Vassels opinion is better than Mysterium you might want to check out [Deception: Murder in Hong Kong](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156129/deception-murder-hong-kong).

It's a deduction game where you are attempting to identify a murderer. The game is similar to Mysterium where a ghost hands out clues in Deception a Forensics Investigator hands out clues in a similar mechanism
Honestly, I wouldn't even consider Cards Against Humanity if I were you. Not because of the mature content, but because it's a step-down, in my opinion, from what he already likes. Say Anything for example is far superior. (Unless you play with unfunny people, in that case maybe we could build a case for Cards Against Humanity.) If you ever want to get a game about crude humor, I would recommend **Joking Hazard**. It's always a matter of taste, but that last one always gives me a laugh.

As for recommendations, I have a few but they're not all that similar:

**Spyfall** is the first that pops in mind. It's a game in which everybody gets the same location card, but one person gets a spy card. Then everybody asks each other questions to find out who the spy is. 

**LinQ** is similar, in which to spies around the table get a secret password, and they have to find each other out by saying words related to it. It's a bit weird, but it works with the right group.

**Codenames** is a cool team-based game about word association. It's been highly popular for the last year.

**Guess the mess** is another weird game. The closest comparison I can make is with Dixit. Each player gets a secret location, and players search in a pile of photos to find pictures that represent their location the best. Then you need to guess someone else's location based on their photos.

**The Resistance: Avalon** is a game in which people are a group of loyal knights, but traitors are around the table. Traitors try to sabotage quests, knights try to succeed them. It definitely more complex than the other games I mentioned, but it's still very accessible.

They're all on the light-side and a bit party-like. If any of them sound interesting, you should look into it, maybe it's what you've been looking for. 
[Things](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10934/things)
Mysterium gets recommended a lot as "the game that Dixit should have been". Also recommend Codenames. If he likes Flux then he'd probably like Sushi Go (relatively straightforward card drafting & set collection), and maybe Dominion (deck building). Love Letter as well, or one of its many variants. Sheriff of Nottingham I believe has bluffing etc., haven't played it, but it's recommended a lot as well. 
A fake artist goes to new york. 

Everyone except one person is given the same word that they have to draw. Each player gets a different colored marker, you take turns adding one line at a time to the drawing. The one person who did not get the word is the fake artist and has to pretend they know the word and contribute to the group drawing. After two rounds everyone has to guess who the fake artist was. 

You can easily play this with slips of paper to write the drawing subject on, a sketch pad, and a set of markers/colored pencils if you don't want to buy the actual game. 
**One Night Ultimate Werewolf** is probably the best type of that game that my friends and I play. You do need a moderator but if you have a smart-phone then there is a free app that does the work for you. 

**Spyfall**, **Two Rooms and a Boom**, **Resistance** are also good options. Two rooms needs a bunch of people though. 
For creative games, I would recommend the following - specifically as replacements for Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity:  
  
* **Snake Oil** - pick two cards to create a new product that you must pitch to a customer (the judge).  
* **Superfight** - You must argue why your character is more awesome than anyone else's. A good example from a review: you could argue that a "Soccer mom who throws bears and thinks the floor is actually lava" is better than a "Vegan who can't stop dancing and summons cats to do their bidding".  
* **Funemployed** is just like Snake Oil, but it is likely too mature without removing any cards. ("Uncontrollable libido" and "Condoms" are definitely in the game.) I only mention this one because I prefer the premise to Snake Oil - you're interviewing for a job, and you have to incorporate the traits/objects on the cards in your hand to appeal to the interviewer and show that you're the most qualified.
[Once Upon a Time](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1234/once-upon-time-storytelling-card-game) - all creative, no filler
* One Night Ultimate Werewolf
* Spyfall
* The Resistance
* Shadows over Camelot
* Codenames

would be my recommendations
Looking at it,  I see a bunch of backers commenting the got their boards like 2 years ago.  So it doesn't appear that this was a scam. It may just be after the initial shipment the company found it wasnt profitable,  or there wasn't the interest in such a niche broadest,  to continue. 

I don't imagine it would be to hard for someone to create a custom risk map with something like the game crafter and a bit of artistic talent. 
In reply to the above: you only need artistic skill. Let amazon handle the board. 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005T3NWOY
You are missing **Dominion - Seaside**, which is cool. **Five Tribes** might be good if you like 2P eurogames. I've seen people recommend **Castles of Burgundy** for 2P (and up) too. I only bought it yesterday so can't give my own opinion yet.

**Star Realms** is another Ascension/Dominion like drafting game, and quite cheap to pick up.

Something you might try is **Arboretum**, it's nice at 2, 3 and 4 players.


*Note: I always have difficulty finding games that are good at 2 AND at 4-6. That's why I am not recommending anything in those ranges. Maybe someone else has something.*
I would suggest Mansions of Madness, or the Arkham Horror LCG. For card games, if you like Dominion, maybe you would like Tanto Cuore, which some people consider a better implementation of Dominion's mechanics.
Maybe try out a worker placement game such as **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Stone Age** or **Viticulture Essential Edition**.

Which of your games are are favorites? 
It would help to know what you do and don't like about the games to really offer great suggestions - are you looking for similar? more/less complex? etc...

If you like the Arkham/Betrayal themes and co-op aspects I would suggest Mansions of Madness 2nd edition.

If you like deck/engine builder games I would suggest something like Splendor or Puzzle Fighter to mix it up.

If you like the worker placement/construction try Manhattan Project or New York 1901
I'm personally a big fan of **Scoville**.  It's an area control game, but you are building the area as you go.  It has a variable player turn order, so going 'first' isn't always the best option for you, adding strategy.  Biggest con is that it is color based so hopefully no one you play with is color blind or it becomes a touch difficult.  There is also an instructional 'Watch It Played' video that always makes teaching easy if you are incapable yourself.

**Power Grid** would be the other game I would recommend, it's just fantastic all the way around, such a good game.
I have seen listings on Amazon but they are $100+ 
[Some people](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardsagainsthumanity/comments/5e5l4u/69_dont_buy_this_product_box_added_to_store/) at /r/CardsAgainstHumanity have already bought it. I can't wait to see what is (or isn't) inside of it.
I was seriously thinking about it, then I went to add it to cart and it's only in the US. I'm Canadian. 
That's a long card box.
I recommend removing expansions from your list before uploading.  Doing that now to save time.  It's tedious for me to rank all my Armada expansions.

UPDATE: Just been using it and SCREWED UP.  Selected a wrong game choice.  This needs an undo or a back button or something.
Made it about 60% of the way through before stopping. It started to be too much of a coin flip between games and subjective based on mood. There are definitely games that would be rated higher than anything else on my list but there's that mid-range that could go either way.
This is a great little tool, well done!

It nailed my top 10 games pretty accurately, obviously these games will be in flux depending on my mood but none the less these are definitely my top 10 games.

2	Forbidden Stars

3	Eclipse

4	Twilight Struggle

Is there a way to import all my rated games from BGG that I scored 5 and up? I don't wanna type them all.
This was a bit of a tedious process with as many games as we own (620+ individual comparisons), but the list is actually going to be pretty useful to me. 

The top of the list doesn't surprise me at all. I have 15 games tied for 1st place (listed in alphabetical order):

* **Concordia**
* **Grand Austria Hotel**
* **Guilds of London**
* **Hansa Teutonica**
* **Keyflower**
* **Kingdom Builder**
* **Kingsburg**
* **Lancaster**
* **Le Havre**
* **Lords of Waterdeep**
* **Lunarchitects**
* **Orleans**
* **Panamax**
* **Ra**
* **SmallWorld**

It makes complete sense to me that these would all be tied. I - personally - would have a hard time ranking them. 

The bottom of the list is what will be most useful to me. It'll allow me to easily identify games that can be purged. We've got a big collection and now I can look at a list like this and figure out what my sale/trade fodder will be over the next year or so. :D
Nice one. This is the one thing I've let slide. I don't rank any of my games, which means I can't take advantage of some web apps that recommend other games. Thanks.
Nice site, love the Foamcore stuff.
I've seen a lot of posts saying that they found the process tedious. I agree, but I think there are some (potentially - I'm not a programmer) easy fixes.
* Have the ability to save an account. That way, you can just do a few matchups as a time-killer, and it could save and compile your results.
* For me, having all promos and expansions included was a pain. For each item, perhaps a trash option could be placed under each game. Click that, and that item will be removed from the rankings. (This could also take out the games that I have listed on my BGG, but are my kids' games.)
I love it. Ranked all 95 games I've played.
Isn't anyone going to mention that it's just Quicksort? Or that Tom Vasel recently mentioned this in his top 100? Neat implementation BTW. 
I write a lot of comments for my games on BGG and they all get added to the list. Is there a way to download my collection with only the names of the games showing?
oof! after exporting i culled my collection from ~150ish to 60 games. here are the top 10 (not sure i agree)

1. **yokohama**
2. **grand austria hotel**
3. **viticulture**
4. **7 wonders: duel / 7 wonders**
5. **trajan**
6. **stone age**
7. **castles of burgundy**
8. **istanbul**
9. **gold west**
10. **quadropolis**
Cool tool, I like this a lot.  It is time intensive - and probably a bit silly - to go through and rank your entire collection.  But if you wanted to figure out your top 10 (or any number) games, very easy to use and a great tool for that.  Even so, it seems that it (I?) couldn't settle on my #9 and #10 games. . .

1) Five Tribes

2) Alchemists

2) Colt Express

4) Concordia

4) La Granja

4) Shakespeare

7) Gold West

8) Legends of Andor

9) Castles of Burgundy

9) Oceanos

9) Spyrium

9) Steam Park

9) Targi
I prefer my Trello board thanks. https://trello.com/b/zQVSivgz/board-game-ranking

A sort is in progress, but do let me know if something is out of place ;-)
I had roughly 180 decisions for my 70 games. I wish it said how many decisions after completion. I also wish there was an option to email this list to myself. I rank everything on BGG but I think it's nice to sit back and look at 2 games vs each other. 
This was fun. Thanks for making this. Great input to my next collection culling. Took a while to get through all 55 games.

Pretty happy about my top 10 though.

1.	Splendor
2.	Memoir '44
3.	Power Grid
4.	Twilight Struggle
5.	Race for the Galaxy
6.	Vinhos Deluxe Edition
7.	The Manhattan Project
8.	Le Havre
9.	Suburbia
10.	Terraforming Mars
My top 25 is pretty accurate! Seeing the top 100 really confirms my general feeling that I'm not big on favorites or top lists- I could see any of them in my top 10 on different days.

Made it through 261 games. 

I included all games I have ranked. 

If I were to do it again, I would have removed *all* the expansions, and only done "one" edition (Dungeon Lords vs Dungeon Lords: Anniversary Edition).

Having to step away and resume later a few times, there are a couple times where it's like "... I feel like this is sorting it oddly..."

But really, you want to seriously cater and cull your input before giving this thing a try.
Pretty accurate:

1	Legendary: A Marvel Deckbuilding Game

2	Eldritch Horror

3	Seasons

4	Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deckbuilding Game

5	Pandemic

6	Power Grid

7	Keyflower

8	Catan

9	Imperial Settlers

10	Ticket to Ride


This really put me thinking about my games and which ones I really do want to play. It took a moment, but good thing I had the time to spare for this.
Would be better if you could select left or right with arrow keys or some other key combinations. 

You can also rank other things.. like your friends =P
These guys gonna give me a shout out for applying my [Turing Sorter](https://github.com/CzechsMix/TuringSorter) ?

Lol.
I don't understand why you'd do this other than waste time. It's very time-intensive, it doesn't take your ratings into account, and figuring out your "top x" games depends on your mood and what you're looking for.
In other news, some people like chocolate ice cream while others prefer vanilla.  We'll have more on this crisis at 11:00.
It's absolutely normal. We all have different tastes. It would be a dull world if we all liked the same things. Pandemic Legacy, Terra Mystica and Kemet are in my personal top 5.
I'm sure I can't stand a game you like. :)
To be fair, I personally never appreciate these types of threads. They have a negative angle on the hobby. You can't be right or wrong about opionions!



You are definitely not insane for not liking Terra Mystica, nor am I insane for liking it so much I put it in my flair.



Now, if you are genuinely interested in discussing, rather than hearing your dislike for these games confirmed by some, let's do it! From your [Top 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5eae30/do_you_hate_superpopular_games/daax0ju/) I deduce that you like conflict heavy games. So I can already tell you that most of the entries in the Top 100 with the category *economic* will not be to your liking. Some may be, but most are euro-games about engine optimization without conflict. Categories *Fighting* and *Wargames* on the other hand you will have a better chance of enjoying.



The fact that Reviewers you respect sometimes recommend a game you don't like might be because they enjoy both eurogames and conflict games.
2 come to mind for me:
**7 Wonders** I find it boring but others seem to love it. Just don't really enjoy the choices there are too make and it feels over complicated in some ways (like the science VP). Would much rather player the simpler and more visually appealing **Sushi Go**.

I know it's not in the top 100 but also feel like this about **Cards Against Humanity** now. Not because I'm offended by it, but because I feel like I've grown out of it and the jokes feel very 1 dimensional. Would much rather play **Snake Oil**, **Funemployed** or **Monikers**.
There are games in the top 100 that I love and games in the top 100 that I very much don't like. It's going to happen. You'll experience the same thing with IMDB's top movie list and anything similar. 
DEPENDS!
I'm not a huge fan of the big bloody video game themes invading my boardgame spaces but apparently everyone else is fully on board with it so I try to game around it. 
I certainly don't hate them because they're popular, but I do dislike games that happen to be popular.

7 Wonders, Splendor, and Sushi Go are the main ones. Also Betrayal at House on the Hill, but my friends love that so I have fun with it anyway.
I just get sick of lots of hype for things that aren't released yet. Scythe, Seafall, Inis, etc. Not that I hate the games when they actually exist to be bought and played, but the "oh, this is going to be amazing" song and dance makes me predisposed to not like the games.
Obviously you are entitled to your opinion and there is nothing wrong with it, but I wonder whether you have actually won a game of Kemet. I am just curious because your experiences do not reflect mine or that of people I play it with at all. I will concede that turn order is pretty important, but you have control over that (i.e. I could take this temple to get a temporary victory point, but that won't help me as much as setting turn order next turn, although I would be missing out on two or three prayer points by doing that...). Still, regardless of your place in the turn order, where you end up should help determine your strategy for that day (if you go early its a good day to buy a tile you need, if you go late its a good day to build up for an attack or two to try and get some points). The tiles themselves are a free for all, but you always know what someone else can buy or not by looking at their pyramids, and it forces you to be flexible (someone else snagged Godspeed, then you should look at stargate and/or the beetle). Combat is brilliant in my opinion, generally I prefer to attack people who have been through a few battles because if I have been paying attention I will know what cards they have played so far, and at the very least I will have more choices then they do until their hand resets. DI cards are generally not that impact in our games (I believe you can only play 1 per battle, are you following that rule?). Also turtling is pretty much never a good idea in Kemet, and it is a terrible way to get points, the game is all about attacking, I have never seen someone win by staying in their city.

Anyways, we love Kemet, I think it is the best in its class of game (deterministic area control), but your opinion is just as valid as mine obviously, and is much more important to you than some random internet person.  Also, have you tried it with the expansion?  It addresses a lot of the issues you might have with the game.
I go to a game club most weeks where the majority of people absolutely love **Epic Spell Wars of The Battle Wizards: Duel at Mt. Skullzfyre**. I played it once and I simply can't stand it. I don't like the game play, the art, the resolution. It happens to all of us. I brought **7 Wonders** (one of my absolute favorites) one week and someone was like "ugh I hate that game". That's why I go to a club with a bunch of people, so that everyone can find something to suit their tastes.  
EDIT: typos
I hate **soccer**, which is super popular here in Germany.
Yes, back when I was beginning to collect, I saw that everyone had posted King of Tokyo on their top 10s and it rated super high on BGG. 

I got it without digging too much into game mechanics - I played it once and I was like... There has to be more to the game right? But nope, dice chucking and that was pretty much it. 

That's when I learned to do lots of research before each purchase. I still run into times when I think a game will be fun and then actual playing is not, but much fewer and farther in between. I wish I had th time and proximity to go to a gaming store to try games in person before buying more often. 
If you mean, do I hate recent breakout games because I want to feel super original, then no. (But I think I play with some people who do.)

If you mean, does part of me hate decent, occasionally fun games because people somehow keep calling them the best ever, then I must plead guilty. If I'm not playing a great game, I'd rather play an underdog game that's equally okay instead of reinforcing some undeserved top-100 title.
I hate that *new* super popular hype games overshadow older games that are much better. You have people who have barely played any games from genre X saying that game Y is an amazing must have shoot to the top 20 of BGG, which in the end results in a lot of disappointment for longtime gamers.
You're not required to like everything, no matter where it is on a top 100 list.  

If you're hating a game just because its popular, well, thats pretty dumb.  

Also, turtling is the worst way to play Kemet, so you might be approaching that the wrong way.

The most important aspect of game for me is its theme and how it is translated to interesting mechanic. So, I find Terra Mystica to be uninteresting despite its popularity. I never think either me or people who love Terra Mystica is wrong, though, it's just a matter of different taste.


Of course there are some games you won't like. In a selection of 100 games, there's never going to be anyone who likes all 100 of them... 
I find nothing weird about different tastes for different people but I do think it's weird you said you turtle in Kemet. You basically only score points for attacking and can field a ton of army super easily. What's going on in your games where people are turtling?
also phrased as, are you a board game hipster?

I don't hate super popular games. I enjoyed Munchkin the first few times i played it, same with cards against humanity and exploding kittens. I have no real desire to play any of them again, but if the mood is right and with the right people I probably would. Similarly with Catan and Ticket to Ride. I've enjoyed them, and I'd play them again with the right people, but given a choice I'd rather play something else.

The trick if there is one, is to recognise what a game is good at it, and why people like it. There's plenty of games I've played that i'm unimpressed with, and will probably never play again in my life, but it's not because they are awful games (though in some cases they are) it's more that I've got so many other good games I'd rather play instead
Outright hating a game should really require a list of reasons that are sound and logical.  Emotionally reacting to games that are highly rated speaks more to some deeper seated anti-popular stance one seems to have.

What didn't get your blood flowing with Yomi, Pandemic Legacy, Terra Mystica?  

Looking at your top 5: I dig Argent sure, BattleCON is slow plodding chess I prefer Exceed over it, haven't done Nothing Personal, Blood Rage I wasn't a fan of the drafting and runaway leader problem, haven't done Forbidden Stars may never do so.  

For the 'super popular games' that I just can't stand, they tend to be the heavily divisive games such as cards against humanity, carcassonne, settlers of catan.  I can't knock people for loving them, I just know I personally will be frustrated to play such games unless those are literally the only games available and no movie to watch lol
I don't hate games because they are popular. I dislike games often because of certain mechanics. One type of game I don't like are highly interactive, free-for-all area control games. I am talking about games such as Kemet, Chaos in the Old World, Risk, Cosmic Encounter and Game of Thrones. I don't like these games because they are popular, but because of how random and arbitrary that these games can end up being. I've had some experiences in Cosmic Encounter that have annoyed me. I had games where a couple would NEVER play anything against each other and would always team up even if it wasn't in their interest to do so. I had a game where one player picked on another the entire game just because it was funny. I had a game where someone wanted to be a pacifist and wouldn't harm anyone, even though there was a leader about to win. These games punish skill because anyone who is good will simply get ganged up on, even if you are barely ahead. It becomes about how well you can manipulate people who are easily fooled than actually playing the game well.

If I play an area control game, I prefer games with teams such as **1775: Rebellion** or **Rex: Final Days of an Empire**. It removes the diplomacy barrier which helps players who suck at it as well as making the game faster because you know exactly who is your ally and who is your enemy rather than wasting time manipulating people.
**Catan**...
No. I like some games, and don't like others, but try not to hate anything. If there was one exception to this rule it would be **Keyflower**, that games firewood.
From your list the only game I actually like and want to play is **Euphoria**. Didn't know it was considered a popular game tho... seems to that it is me the least talked about Stonemaier game.
I host a bunch of events, but I've never made the move to rent out a place.  Instead I would suggest getting very involved in your community (Meetup.com is a great way to accomplish this), and from there work yourself up.  I started with hosting at my own place obviously and once I got to 15+ people showing up weekly, I moved onto hosting game nights at stores, and now I'm helping run 24 hour events at these stores.  I'd say once you've gotten to the point where people show up to your events then I would see if you have any cheap options to host at larger venues, for example in my area if I want to I could host at a local church for free.  You could also try bars/restaurants, and private halls.  Once a friend of mine simply used a hall at his condo to have his own birthday party and we easily had 40+ guests show up for it and it probably cost him $50-100 to rent the place for a night.

So just to sum it up, run smaller events at free places and get a consistent attendance.  Then move onto small free/cheap venues.  Also be willing to take a hit as well, but because you planned it at a small/cheap venue it won't be a large one, then learn from there.
Actually the real reason they exist is because the number of playing cards or tiles of the game are often not being an exact multiple of the number of cards or tiles that fit on a single print sheet - and publishers don't want to pay for a worker who manually sorts out the overprints (who could then also be a source of a packaging error).

I usually just throw them away.
I usually keep them for when we're playing a game while my 18 month old is awake. I then give them to her so she can "play". I must admit, it worked better when she was younger... she's catching on to the blank cards and it's not working very well any more. But on the plus side, she's trying to mimic stuff we're doing now, so we're definitely raising a board gamer! 

For example, we were playing Carcassonne the other night, and she was playing with the meeples of one of the colors we weren't using. She kept taking the meeples and placing them on roads on the tiles we'd already placed. She's really getting smart.
Nope, and after holding on to ALOT of them for years, I recently threw them out.


Blank tiles in roll? I'm usually pretty methodical when unpacking games but don't tremendous seeing blank tiles..:(
I keep them, I always assumed they were to help with the inevitable loss of a card/piece.
I've held on to the card that designated my La Granja cards as being an English pack instead of a German one. It's just a normal card on one side, and the other side has a big old American flag. I want to come up with some cheesy variant rule that's appropriately 'Murican but doesn't actually impact the game.
I kept the Ghost Stories one because Odd numbers bother me. Lol
> What's the term for the moment when players forgets a rule because it hinders them?

Cheating.
Selective memory?
I've never heard of people forgetting rules just because they don't like them. These sound more like fiddly or as I like to call them "fuzzy" rules because they are easy to forget and usually the game does not have an good way to remind you of the specific rule.
Trying to play a card up as part of your wonder in 7 Wonders... Like they know how the game works and still try and do this? Wouldnt that just be incredibly obviously to anyone who looks at their board? 
I don't think there's any specific term for it. Either "forgot the rule" (if they actually forgot the rule) or "cheating" (if they intentionally "forgot" the rule). This is true no matter whether the rule being forgotten is detrimental or not.
Pandemic, when trading for the last card you need to cure on the same term hand size still applies. I've been playing the app a lot and it baffles my mind how often I didn't do it in the actual game.
> Twilight Struggle, losing VP because you didn't raise your Military. After every time I coup, I audibly say how many VP my opponent will lose before saying it is there turn.

Wait, isn't the 'Check military operations phase' after all the action rounds have been done? When reading your post it seems like you play like it happens every action round?
Mostly familiarity with games and game systems; and how those systems interact with logic.   

Sometimes games ask you to do things that seem counterintuitive, and those are usually where things get lost.   

Personally, don't care much. Does it break the game? Is the player having fun? Does it interfere with anyone else's fun?   

House rules exist for a reason, and if playing a game wrong makes you not want to play it, what's the point?
Amnesia by convenience?  :)
Your wrong on the splendor rule...... You can draw the same color twice but that's it and that's only if there is a certain amount of them.
It's cute that you think you know why people forget things. 
If you want a really light RPG dungeon crawler, go with Mice and Mystics. I didn't enjoy it very much as it was mechanically repetitive/boring and offered very little character customisation / progression. Basically the whole game is dice chucking with a childish story and lacks any strategic/important decisions. Some people like it, I don't. There are plenty of better options if you're looking for a dungeon crawler game.

Blood Rage is pretty usual dudes on a map game. Replay value is good as you're drafting the cards and can try different strategies. It's a totally different experience than Mice and Mystics so if you prefer competitive games over co-op games, go with Blood Rage. If you look up more information about it, you'll find complaints about overpowered card combinations / strategies which may become a problem if someone in your gaming group likes to exploit op options and doesn't value groups enjoyment over his/her own. You can try to prevent from using those combos but it's not guaranteed because of the drafting mechanic. I've yet to see any problems with those so I don't think they're a big deal. Otherwise the game is good for 3+ players.
As mentioned before, give us more information about what type of games you like and we can advise you a bit better.
You've not really given enough information about what type of games you enjoy or what you feel is missing from your collection for anybody to make a personalised suggestion.

Blood Rage is rated very highly on both BGG and this sub, and is the only one I've played (I really like it FWIW), so if I had to decide between the two without considering any personal factors I would go for that. Mice and Mystics is a relatively simple entry into co-op RPGs/dungeon crawlers so might be more appropriate for a younger or newer audience looking for that sort of experience.
Haven't played Mice and Mystics, but really like Blood Rage. Hard to make a recommendation without knowing what you'd like though.
I had a blast playing **Mice and Mystics** as a veteran D&D player with my SO with no experience in RPG's. The rules were light enough, the game has a decent story and the game is gorgeous. We're now at chapter 3 with her mom and her brother and I'm sure that we're going to finish that campaign aswell. 

We painted the miniatures together, we 3d-printed some stuff like cheese etc. and recently we bought the Heart of Glorm expansion for quite cheap (otherwise we would not have bought it) and I'm really looking forward to painting the miniatures and making a foam core insert to put everything in the main box. 

I can recommend it, but the game has flaws. It's very important to understand what it wants to achieve and for what audience it is. I played the game more as a story than as a boardgame. If it was too hard, I would help us. If it was too simple I would help the game, to achieve a better story. You have to be flexible (atleast, that's what I think).

I don't have **Blood Rage**, nor did I ever play it. But from what I've heard, it's a really good game. Can't comment further.
Blood Rage is an excellent competitive area control game. Plays better with more people and you need an expansion to play with five people.

Mice and Mystics is a fun, light dungeon crawler you play cooperatively and for the experience. As with any dungeon crawler there is a lot of dice rolling, so if you don't like games with luck to them it will probably be a miss. 

I really enjoy both, however we are playing Mansions of Madness over any other dungeon crawlers at the moment.
Hey! Fellow brazilian here.

Just as everyone has said, you have to give us more info on your particular tastes.

I've played both and got rid of **Mice and Mystics**, it's just not engaging... the storyline is fine, but if I want a cool story I rather read a book.
Similar experience here.  I preorderd 7 Ronin and the board was marred in a few spots. I emailed grey fox and although I didnt hear anything within a week I had a new board in my hands.
Big shout out to Fantasy Flight here, too. Replaced 5 of my Ties from Star Wars Rebellion after they broke because of light play, and replaced a misprinted die from my new Rey Starter deck from Star Wars Destiny.

Both were in the mail within 24 hours. They do an AWESOME job.
FFG is fantastic about this stuff. A while ago I realized that I had lost a few models from StarCraft: The Board Game, sent in an email about it, and they sent out the pieces within a week. This, despite the fact that StarCraft has been out of print for years and (AFAIK) FFG doesn't even have the license for it anymore.
I've had good luck with Grey Fox.  My copy of Deception: Murder in Hong Kong had scene tiles that were all wrong (I had 2 each of only half the scene tiles).  I emailed over a holiday weekend and a complete new set of tiles was in the mail to me the morning of the next business day with a friendly message from the warehouse.
I had an issue with one of my squadrons for Armada, no tree stand thing to put the ships on, they sent me two to replace it :) I'm in NZ and I got it in about a week, so was super happy with that.
UpperDeck has been really good about replacing damaged or missing product in all my legendary stuff I've ordered.
The Catan guys sent me a new white city immediately when I got it as it was missing, pleased with their service. 
We house rule that you can't use the Amusement Park power on an extra turn, but its just that a house rule. 
I've never played MK BL, but I play MK at least once a week (with or without Green Valley or Harbor expansions, depends), so I don't know how Amusement Park stacks with Moon Tower, but in MK, playing several turns because of doubles invoking Amusement Park is totally legit.


I played a few games, and didn't care for it at all.  In one game, I'm 100% certain that my opponent made superior choices, but I ended up annihilating him handily because I rolled better.  And, I totally agree with you--each game that I played felt "over" long before it actually ended.  

For me, the game brought absolutely nothing new to the table.  I wouldn't buy into it even if it were an LCG.  Having to dump money into it as a collectible game is just out of the question.  

5/10, would not play again.
I love card battlers but have since moved away from CCGs. I like dice masters because it's cheap and the super rares are not necessarily any better than the commons. I like LCGs because it's not random. I was going to do SW Destiny until I saw the release schedule and the set bundles from steam Covenant. They price a full set at $300 and if there are several a year that's just way too much money for me. Sure you don't need to own everything but I've become spoiled on LCGs and who wants to buy boxes only to still be missing that card you need. I could get a year of a LCG for well under $200.
I played Netrunner at a competitive level, too.    
My opinions from the pre-release: SW:Destiny plays fast, it's rich in interesting choices, but probably not at the same level as Netrunner. Constructed decks will surely be more consistent than the starter kits, and more fun to play (like Netrunner core set starting decks vs. actual built decks).

This said, the business model is what kills it for me. If I'm steamrolled by a great deck, I can't simply open my binder and build it for, but I have to purchase a lot of $ of cards.
I liked it. It was good fun and pretty simple too. Though it seemed potentially snowbally, particularly since if you were the first to lose a character it meant you were rolling fewer dice in the future.
 
The distribution is potentially quite annoying. I opened 9 boosters and I'd estimate that I can't use about half of my cards right now. Since I bought only one starter set (which had only villains/neutral cards) I haven't opened a yellow character, so I can't use any yellow cards from boosters. Similarly I only have one hero character opened, not enough to build a deck with, so I can't use any hero affiliation cards.
I'm surprised there's not more positive buzz for this game right now. It plays fast, is easy to teach, and we've found it to be extremely fun. Once you start constructing decks you can introduce more dice mitigation and play much more consistantly despite the dice. 

Destiny is more comparable to a game like Pokemon than Netrunner. It has randomness by the nature of its design and that's an OK thing. Owning everything is far from necessary. And like Pokemon it's just a fun time for everyone involved.
My worst fear is that it's a great game with a really shitty anti-consumer business model. I'm still disappointed FFG decided to betray what made me love them. 
Fast, fun battler but I am absolutely not in the demographic for the distribution model. Simple as that, really.
As a Netrunner player I found the game to be very refreshing and fun. A friend and I thought we'd show up, get our packs, play for an hour and head home but we were there for nearly 5 hours playing games.  
  
Yes, it's a CCG so if you have no self control or need to own everything, it's going to be monumentally expensive, but in terms of the game itself, it really is quite fun and despite the simple rulebook (FFG and simple rule book, hell has frozen over) the tactics and decisions felt very meaningful.  
  
I'm probably going to throw some money into the pit and buy in for a booster box once per cycle. It was fast paced and different enough from other games I own that even if I'll likely get crushed at whatever tournament I go to by those willing to spend more money I'll still have fun.  
  

I think it's a pretty well designed game.  There is a lot of decisions to be made, and counter-play that takes place removing opponents dice and whatnot.  It's too early to tell how much the rare / legendary cards will make or break the game.  Obviously it can be pricey if you want to go competitive.  For me, I'm planning on playing an occasional game during lunch at work with a co-worker. So we can limit our purchases and try to keep it fair between us.
Former MTG player here (way back in the day) and I like the look of it as a game the CCG model is a huge turn off for me. There's no such thing as the odd casual game when it comes to deck building games, your experience will always feel incomplete due to the lack of structured play that comes with lack of card options.
My wife and I think it's awesome.  I'm just glad we've found something competitive that we can both get into and have fun with.  She's a gamer to the bone, but things like Netrunner and X-Wing are not really her bag.
LCG vs CCG discussion is always so in favor of LCG although I guess there are plenty of people who like the whole subgame of trading, opening packs and everything. CCG doesn't inherently need to be more expensive either, it's just about how the company does it. CCG makes people think of magic which is stupidly expensive yes but some LCG's have silly cashgrabs too, like making great cards in base sets a 1-of so you still need 3 to be competitive and having stupidly long rotation cycle and fast update schemes that you need a lot.

All in all most of these competitive games are expensive and have a large meta part that a newcomer is hopeless against the tried and tested decks/builds of the experienced players. Guess that's part of the appeal. 

CCG does have some benefits as well as having naturally nice drafting available. LCG formats can have that as well with Cube setups etc. but that's it. 

Personally I've stopped playing all of these, I find the fact that you can only play them with experienced players and a limited scene a bit annoying and they are too expensive. I occasionally like to do a MTG draft or sealed(i just sell or give away my cards after) but that's it. 

I'd like it if there actually was a casual CCG/LCG where costs wouldn't be so high, like a pack of 15 cards would just be 1 buck. 
Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective is my go-to co-op answer on these boards.
Paperback is your answer. Can play coop or competitively depending on your mood, and easily scales to 5 players. Your wife can school you with her vocabulary, while you flex your board game deck building skills. 
Sounds similar to my wife, so hopefully if you take any of my advice, it works out for ya!

Mine strongly dislikes Pandemic (and I'm on my way...), though Pandemic: The Cure we both like. It feels like we get more control over our turns and things are more tactical than strategic.

Honestly, I think you should look at Viticulture. My wife loves it, and so do I. It works from 1 to 6 players, though I have only played it 1-3 so far, and I prefer it at 2. I've heard it's best at even counts, though I did enjoy the solo mode a lot too.

Beyond that, I think games that work best at 2 or are designed specifically for 2 are what you should look at. There's nothing wrong with getting something for you to primarily play with your wife (Patchwork, Jaipur, Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy, Shadowrun Crossfire, ...and then we held hands).

My wife also likes the Dr. Finn games, like Biblios, Capo Dei Capi, and Cosmic Run. The latter is probably my favorite, and it supports 1-4 players, I believe. I've played it solo and with her, and she also liked it.

Another that works well at 2 players is Eight-Minute Empire: Legends. If you're after some area control, we both like that one. It's simple, but fun, and fairly fast (about 8 minutes per player, probably). If you think Catan is too simple, this is simpler... So there's that. But I like it more than Catan. I don't own Catan, though.

My final recommendation is Beyond Baker Street. It's using the core mechanic from Hanabi, but layers on theme, a game board, and it works great at 2 players, and goes up to 4. It's a great little game.
Take a look at **Splendor**, **Lords of the Waterdeep** (+exp), **Shakespeare** and (maybe) **Keyflower**.
Try Patchwork. My wife and I keep it on our top 5 games  at home
My wife and I have been trying to find the perfect 2p game as well - here are our tops so far. 

*Star Realms* - light, cheap, simple to teach, but a very deceptive level of depth. The factions and deck building in here are fine tuned to be a very engaging game with multiple levels of strategy fit inside a small 10-15 minute game. 

*Castles of Burgundy* - just wanted to note we love it too

*Agricola / Agricola ACBAM* - great very well balanced game. Lots of pieces and setup, so we actually prefer the app version. We could spend an entire day playing these. 

*Le Havre* - we like this game a ton too. App version also good here but can be harder to see all your options.

*Seasons* - not talked about very often but between the artwork and game play, this is one of our favorites. I would say comparable in some ways to castles.

*Robinson Crusoe* - takes a bit longer to play, but very strategic and rewarding game play. 

Other games I wish my wife would like more that are objectively good 2p

*Star wars rebellion* - played a game with my friend and really liked it but my wife is generally against anything star wars. It bores her. Hopefully the movies get better and she starts to like it more? 

*Summoner wars* - I think it's a good light strategy card game with physical positioning but my wife doesn't like it bc she feels it doesn't have enough options. 
King of tokyo, tides of madness, tsuro, love letter are some I play with my wife who doesn't like alot of components either
====>

Please look at the [What Should I GET [WSIG] tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig) the amount games to pick may feel overwhelming, but it's all really good.

However, here are my essentials either way.

**Pandemic** ; **Mission: Red Planet** ; **Jamaica** ; **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** ; **Ticket to Ride** ; **King of Tokyo** ; **Viticulture** ; **Sheriff of Nottingham** ; **Concordia**
Sounds like you want **Pandemic** for starters.


It's great to know the type of games you like, but who will you be playing with?

I did the same as others are suggesting and bought a bunch of the most popular games (at the time it was Pandemic, Smash Up, King of Tokyo, Caverna, 7 Wonders, and Splendor). 

Iquickly learned, though, that my group likes more social games, bluffing games, and definitely noy engine building and worker placement.

I spent a ton of money on games that would just sit (I sold some). I learned what my group liked, made adjustments, and it's much better.

One game that has not failed yet for a number of different groups is **Colt Express**.
**Viticulture: EE** was one of the first games I bought, which I heartily recommend. I will be receiving the **Tuscany: EE** expansion tomorrow which will be played on Thanksgiving.

**Big Book of Madness** is another relatively simple game that can be played cooperatively with newer players. 

**Takenoko** is easy to learn and gorgeous. My first designer board game, too. Another easy one for new players is **Escape: Zombie City**, which provides chaotic, timed fun.
How did you come to the hobby? What games(s) did you play that made you say, I like this and want to experience more of it? It can give us a frame of reference to go from.
There are no real essentials.

I'd suggest going along to a game group if you have one local and playing other people's games for a while to get an idea of what games you like. Then you can build up your collection from there
Hey I'm new to the hobby as well so take my rec with a pinch of salt.

I'm going to suggest something I see rarely spoken about. I think for a great co-op game you should at least look at, Legendary Encounters: Alien.

Firstly you should look up Deck Builders and decide whether you would enjoy those mechanics because at it's core that is what it is (it's similar to Ascension for example) but I suggest this game because I believe it is one of the most replayable games I own. You can play through the 4 movies with different characters, it works with different group numbers (1-5) and you have extra rules to make it easier or harder or just to spice things up.

Also if you really enjoy the game there is an expansion released tomorrow PLUS it already fully integrates with Legendary Encounters: Predator for AvP fun (LE:Predator works stand alone too).

It's easy to learn and teach but it is a challenging game, sometimes random chance will kill you but most the time you can play around lots of things that would happen (once you know the cards and scenarios).

So in summary, it's a co-op deck builder that's got longevity through challenge AND lot's of different rule sets and it's expandable if you really enjoy it. 
My own suggestion is Settlers of Catan. Great 3~4 player competitive game. Easy to learn, fun for almost everyone. If you want to up the difficulty, you can buy the knights and cities expansion, which makes the game perfect for me. There are also 5~6 player expansions, which make the game slightly slower, but it's still a good time with friends.
I'd suggest two things...

First, find a theme or mechanism you like.  Do this by playing games at a local store or meet-up group.  Think of your play group will like it.  Nothing stinks worse than plunking $50 on a game that sinks.

Second, there are a broad catagory of games called gateways.  These are generally accepted as light, family friendly titles that are a good step from the Hasbro fare we grew up with.  Each individual'S list is different but here's my suggestions...

Dexterity (like Jenga) - **Junk Art** amazing stacking game with irregular shapes and 10 different ways to play.  Only drawback is the $80 retail price tag.

Routebuilding - **Ticket To Ride** - probably the game that I have played the most.  Fun and quick.  Doesn't outstay it's welcome.

Deduction (like Clue) - **Love Letter** - clever pocket sized game about deducing player's hand.  Brilliant game for $8!

Social Deduction (group Clue) -**Werewolf** - this is a riot of a party game!  Resistance is good as well but with a little more rules.  Regardless it's a hidden identity team game of wiping the other team out by lying.

Strategy - **Imhotep** - most people recommend Catan but Catan is 20 years old.  It's good, but there are problems with it (king making, dice rolling, long).  Imhotep is a brilliant and accessible game that takes minutes to learn and plays under an hour.  My favorite game from this year.

Cooperative - **Pandemic** - Classic cooperative game.  Theme and gameplay is spot on.  Love this game!  

Card game - **Archaeology - A New Exploration (?)** - great set collecting game with variable play modes in the box.  Fantastic and highly recommended!

Dice game - **Qwixx** - Light game that plays more like a puzzle.  You can get the deluxe version today at target for less than $8.

Tile laying - **Tsuro** - great and fast game.  It won't blow your mind but you'lol want to replay it.  

Deckbuilder (like Magic sort of) - **Dominion** - kind of a drab theme but this game really has legs.  You buy cards in game to customize your deck.  Very clever and fun!

Trivia - **Wits & Wagers** - trivia game that doesn't punish not knowing the answers.  

Roll and Move - **Formula D** - racing game that makes clever use of bigger and larger face count dice to represent gears.  There's problems with a runaway winner, but it's still fun!
My thoughts as follows, however please do your due diligence and research beforehand. I tend to gear towards 1 hr plus games with tough decision making.  

**Thematic Entry Wargame:** War of the Ring 2nd Edition (4-6 hrs) 

**Area Control:** Clockwork Wars (1 1/2 hrs)

**Co-op:** Ghost Stories (Pandemic falls flat for me) 

**Euro** The Gallerist 

**Solitaire:** Mage Knight - Please DO A LOT OF RESEARCH prior to considering this.

**Non-Entry Wargame:** Falling Skies 

**Party Game:** Codenames

**Deckbuilder:** Legendary Encounters: Alien 

**4X:** Eclipse 

**Dungeon Crawler:** Descent: 2nd Edition (alternatively if you can find it, Gears of War). 

**Just want to die a lot?**: Robinson Crusoe, Space Hulk Death Angel 




In April of next year my game **Train Heist** will be released via the publisher Cryptozoic,  which is co-op, competitive, AND 4-player game.  
If there is one near you, get yourself to a boardgame meetup (meetup.com) or a board game cafe. Always better to try before you buy if at all possible.
Your tastes will vary of course, but for a newcomer (which I was 2 years ago), the sheer volume of choices can be overwhelming. However, there are a few mainstays that I think every gamer should check out to familiarize themselves with popular mechanisms and to see what they like, starting with "The Big 3" of modern games:

- **Ticket to Ride** - This game is a contemporary classic and is what I have found the broadest success with among family and friends who are new to games. The rules are simple: collect sets of cards and then "spend" them to build train routes between cities. There is however, a great deal of depth and strategy to be found once you've played a couple of times, and the game's artwork and charm shine really well on the table (a characteristic of many Days of Wonder games).

- **Carcassonne** - While Ticket to Ride helped introduce my family to games, the game that has had the most staying power is, without question, Carcassonne. Again, the rules are deceptively simple: each turn you draw a tile out of a bag and add it to an ever-growing map, trying to strategically place pieces to gain points along the way. But when you really dig into the meat of this game, it can get extremely competitive and has more conflict than you would imagine. If you add the first two expansions, it becomes a near-perfect balance of depth and difficulty.

- **Catan** - Arguably the granddaddy of modern Euro-style games in the West, Catan is still a unique experience and worth playing as a way to acclimate yourself with common mechanisms like resource gathering, area control, and negotiation.

Other contemporary classics:

- **Pandemic** - If there is a fourth game that has most shaped modern gaming and basically established the cooperative genre, it's Pandemic. You and your friends can try to save the world from 4 infectious and deadly diseases. It's fun, it's easy to learn, and the difficulty can be adjusted in a brilliantly simple way to accommodate newbies and pros alike.

- **Codenames** - If you have a relatively large group of players and/or you want something a bit more casual that can be enjoyed with drinks or as a filler between other things, Codenames is the game for you. It's always a huge hit at large gatherings and scratches the word game and party game itch in a way that, for me, a game like Cards Against Humanity doesn't.

- **Dominion** - If you and your friends like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, or basically any other TCG or CCG in recent memory, Dominion might be worth a look. There are still CCGs and LCGs for fans of specific licensed properties like Star Wars and Game of Thrones out there, and even other (arguably better) deckbuilders, but Dominion, like Pandemic, established a baseline for its genre and it remains an extremely popular and well-supported gamed to this day. It's also the game that got my fiancée hooked, so that's worth a mention. :-)

You really can't go wrong with any of these. I would check out www.boardgamegeek.com as well, anything in the Top 100 games is usually pretty stellar, but of course that is highly subjective and varies according to taste as well. I would also check out some online video reviewers if you're interested in a game, to see what it's all about.

**Welcome to the family!**
**Isle of Skye**- A more evolved tile laying game which combines many other game mechanics (Auction/Bidding/Bluffing). Pretty light (i play with my 6 year old daughter) and very fun.

**Keyflower**-A heavier worker placement which also combines many mechanics in a single game. Brillant game.
Everyone has already answered this question really well, but I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents, just for the hell of it.

Coop - 

* **Pandemic** (The best choice, most likely), 
* **Forbidden Island** (Simpler than Pandemic but uses very similar mechanics)
* **Forbidden Desert** (ever so slightly more difficult than FI, but still entry level)
* **Pandemic: The Cure** (If you like the idea of chucking dice over drawing cards)
* **Mysterium** - good for groups of 4 to 7, its a cool murder mystery game, a combination of **Dixit** and **Clue**
* **Betrayal at House on the Hill** (The next step up, as it throws in a traitor, and rules are more verbose)

Competitive - 

* **Ticket to Ride** - get any version that appeals to you.
* **Tokaido** - A good, tranquil laid-back game.

Filler Games (5-20 minutes)

* **Love Letter**
* **Coup**
* **Hanabi**
* **Exploding Kittens** 



if you're desperate for a game of snake oil, just find a random word generator and print out 500 random nouns. think of 30 or so jobs and make cards for them. rules are online. bam. snake oil.
Ah. I have a copy I rarely play but unfortunately decided a while ago not to store it in the original box (very cheap plastic insert and very cheap tuck box so threw them out).

If you'd have any interest in buying an unboxed copy let me know. I'm based in Brighton.

I kickstarted Bad Medicine and haven't played Snake Oil since recieving that.
I played Asylum with two using the two-characters-each rule, and didn't like the experience. I want to play the expansions with more people.
I would advise you to just try to get 2 more people to play (because sometimes it feels like even 3players was never intended and 4 is the only optimal player count)

You will enjoy it a lot more, and you will not need to house rule to 'try and make it work'. You only get a few hours to experience each scenario so make it count...
Playing one character each worked for us. We finished Asylum in two sessions.
I played it with four and it was kind of meh in our opinion.  It would have completely sucked with 2 I think.
My wife and I have played through the Asylum and several of the expansions with just one character each, and it works perfectly fine, for the most part.

In one of the stories (can't recall which at the top of my head, maybe Prophecy of Dragons?) we felt there was an apparent need for a third one, so when restarting the run we added one more guy as an "ally", who just followed us around.

But just try with two, and wing it. It's much more enjoyable that way, IMHO, and I don't really want to complete the mission in as little time as possible anyway - I want some value for my money. :)

And Bob's going to bitch about your progress no matter what. ;-)

I've only played Ghost Stories, but I do have to say it's fantastic. It can tend towards the AP players a bit, if you're not careful, but we always have a blast and it's definitely a nail-biter. I've played quite a few co-ops and if you don't count  Pandemic Legacy, it's definitely the best IMO. The traitor coops (BSG, SoC) have something a bit different to them, but in a lot of ways I still prefer Ghost Stories. So good.
I have Jamaica and play it often with adults. It's a really good game to introduce to beginners. It's beautiful to look at and the mechanics aren't too complicated for newbies. Everyone I know (adults) who have played it have enjoyed it, one of my friends even purchased a copy she liked it so much.
Jamaica is great! I teach it to everyone, and we always have a great time playing it. Terror in needle city is a little tougher to get on the table, because people don't want to blow or move around all the time. 
Terror in Meeple City is a fun brainless game. Enjoy throwing buses at each other (and missing), laugh at someone failing to blow over a building, cry when you poor monster fails to make it up to the pavement for the fourth flick in a row.

It's a fun filler with people who take it as such.
I can only comment on **Jamaica**. I really like it: it's fun, it's pretty, it's about pirates, and it's pretty. The board is beautiful, the cardboard chits feel nice, and the little ships are cool.

Every time I've played it, it's been fun. I've played it with family and friends who aren't into boardgames, but have had a good time and enjoyed it. So, no - not too simple for adults - just fun.


I've played them all! Of them, **Ghost Stories** is likely my favourite. 

**Jamaica** is a fun family game of roll and move around an island. It's probably the most fun I've had with a roll and move game, because there are still interesting decisions to be had. It looks gorgeous on the table - great for kids, and okay for adults, but not for long.

**Terror In Meeple City/Rampage** is another fun family game, where everyone gets to wreck stuff. This sounds more fun than it actually is, though... because after one or two games - the novelty has been a bit exhausted. It's also a PAIN IN THE @$3 to set up. Great for kids, but like Jamaica, adults will lose interest quickly.

**Ghost Stories** will start by frustrating you to no end, because it's a challenge. That's good though... because it's a fun challenge, and you'll get better at it over time. Wave after wave of ghost warrior will appear and you need to figure out the best and most efficient ways of dealing with them. It's fun. :)
**Terror in meeple city** feels like a game that I would enjoy once a year at someone else's house. 

**Ghost Stories** is pretty difficult. Don't expect you'll win much, but when you do, it's awesome. I own it myself. Gorgeous art, gorgeous theme. It's all about mitigating dice. Our group prefers **Pandemic** over **Ghost Stories** but that's because our group plays lighter games.

Never played **Jamaica**, but the Dice Tower is "pretty positive" about it.
I love Ghost Stories. One of my favourites. The rulebook is bad though. It's incredibly challenging, so if you a problem losing a lot, look elsewhere.

I've only played Rampage (TIMC) with adults. We have a lot of fun. It's always good to see how bad you all are at flicking. I don't think it's too juvenile. Setup is a bit annoying Because you're placing 50 meeples in random order, with help it can go quickly.

Never played Jamaica. It's on my wishlist though.
Ghost stories has an atrocious rulebook for me. It felt vague and i needed to watch a video to correct my play after reading it multiple times and playing practise rounds. After you get past that the game is good enough. I'm not a fan of co-ops generally but this puzzle can be interesting. i would recommend if you know you enjoy co-ops

Jamaica is an excellent gateway style family game that seems random but more often than not the best player comes out ahead. Really love this game. Gate the treasure map style finding rulebook but luckily you almost never have to look at it. 

Terror in meeple city is awesome. It's an hour of good solid fun and there is enough strategy there to satisfy people who don't embrace the theme. I love it so much a bought two copies so i can do two board mega games. 

Jamaica and terror in meeple city are not to kiddy and are great with adults. Don't bring them to your local heavy euro players as an alternative to 18XX games but they do what they say on the tin.
I'm personally not a fan of **Ghost Stories** It's very difficult, to the point it put off our group from trying to figure out how to win. It felt like a grind to me. The dice rolls that decide a lot of events I found very frustrating.

Even when trying to play the odds as best we could it just felt like an unlucky roll ruined it all in a way that didn't feel fun.

Other people love it though.
Ghost Stories is a terrific game, but it is *brutally* difficult.  It took us four games to beat it on beginner.

Jamaica is always a hit with whatever group I bring it out for.  Light-hearted, pirate battle fun.  :)
I love co-op games and I've played dozens of them over the years, and I still consider Ghost Stories either the best or close to it.
I would recommend Diamant. I only found the French version, but the rules are available online in English on BGG, and it's really easy to remember everything once you read them once. The components have no text on them.

(This is basically the same as Incan Gold, but I think Diamant has nicer components)

A couple other games I can think of that support 8 players and would maybe be OK for kids... Unusual Suspects, maybe. Saboteur. Telestrations, maybe. Cash N Guns (if you're OK with foam guns... and pointing at each other). 6 nimmt! Spyfall, maybe. It's hard to know about a couple of those, if 5 is old enough or not. My kid just turned 4, and a year from now, I am not sure if he could play some of these. I hope so!
The usual advice when playing with kids is to go for **Codenames: Pictures**. It's more direct at times. (like you see a picture of a spider, you can give the clue "spider-1"). But 5 is a pretty young age, and Codenames can actually be difficult for a kid that age to actually understand. Anyone aged 8 and above should be fine. 

With a bunch of kids, dexterity games generally work well too. **Go Cuckoo** is one that I have tried with 8 year olds. It's also a game I play with just adults with drinking rules. When playing with kids, you can make it simple and always build up the nest. When playing with adults, you can play very cut throat and always try to sabotage each other. So I guess what I'm saying is, it works well with all ages and play style can be adjusted depending on the age range haha. I think the max player count is 5, but my friends and I have just split into teams when we have 6+ people. **Coconuts** is another one that might work well. Since it only comes with 4 monkeys, you would just need to divide the teams as needed. Probably pair up the adults with the youngest kids and have the older kids pair up with each other. 

I haven't tried it with kids, but I think **Telestrations** might work well. The art skills of most of my friends and mine have not developed too much since we were children. Also, it might be hilarious to see how a younger child might interpret a drawing as to an older child's or even an adults. 
**Camel Up** is the only game I know of that I would play with kids and can handle up to 8 players. 

It is easy to learn, easy to play, super fun, and plays in under an hour (although full disclosure, I have never played it with a full 8 people). Once you get passed the "No, you are not one of the camels" aspect, it is an excellent gateway game for amy age.
Try Rhino Hero, you will be amazed on the success this little and cheap game has on mixed-age groups
I rec Sushi Go Party, it will not bring back MTG drafting flashbacks. We just introduced it to a group of four kids and four adults, even with the full eight it ran smooth.


I highly recommend you buy two sets of Dr. Eureka, for a total of eight players just combine the sets. You really just need the extra test tubes and can even entertain many more with enough extra sets. 


Telestrations can be very frustrating for the kids IME, better to just have them play a kid only game and have some adult game time separately.


ETA er/remove a doubled "highly" I guess I am really into my recommendations tonight ;)
**Snake Oil** can play a lot of people. The younger ones may not be able to pitch ideas that well, but still fun nonetheless.
**One Night Ultimate Werewolf**
This guy is great, subscribed. 
It seems like a really awesome gladiator game.

But that price point for only 4 characters?  If it was double that then I would consider it a good purchase.
Really fun game. Lovely detail on the miniatures. I do agree regarding the board but if someone truly desires it they can create one w scenery and audience etc like people have done over the years with blood bowl.  Certain this case is not as intense as a blood bowl league but hey lobbying ftw

I may end up getting this just to port the characters into Age of Sigmar for a slightly better price. I've enjoyed many of GW's new boxes over the last few years and I'm sure I'd enjoy this one, but the downtime from player elimination bugs me a bit. No one in my group is going to want to sit around the table and watch others play for more than a few minutes. 
**Inis** all the way. Gorgeous game and also really, really good. We got it to the table the other night, and played it twice. First game went long due to us getting the rules and general strategy down, then the second was finished in 35-45 minutes or so. After we finished we all had a collective, "yeah this game is awesome" moment. It will definitely be in our group faves. 
I think **Abyss** still stands out for me. Amazing artwork, on top of a really good game.
I'm not sure if LCGs are your thing or not.  But **Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn** has really good art and visual design. It is still very CCG art (fantasy monsters and whatnot) but done about as good as it could possibly get and also very consistent, which is a huge plus for me. 

It's a bit busy, but **Seasons** and **Lords of Xidit** also have quite nice art and presentation. **Above and Below**, **Lotus**, **Big Book of Madness**.
Dixit has some amazing abstract art and it's a solid party game
I don't strictly recommend the game, but the best looking game I own is probably **Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King**. It looks so bursting with energy and life.

Also, shout out to **Millennium Blades** for looking pretty good while having probably the most art of any single game - all drawn by one guy.

Final shout out to **Food Chain Magnate** for its 50% awesome, 50% nonexistant art design.
I played a card game recently called Control. It was a Kickstarter from earlier this year. The artwork is amazing.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keymastergames/control-a-strategic-card-game

It's printed using only 3 colors, and 2 of them are metallic gold, and metallic silver inks. The artwork has a comic book style with very stark lines. Stunning.
If she has **Dixit** and **Mysterium**, and likes them, the obvious next step is **Dreams**.
Some of my favourite art from my collection:

**The Gallerist**

**Voyages of Marco Polo**

**Bruxelles 1893**

**Scythe**

**Lewis & Clark**

**Tobago**
Above and Below is one of our favorites, as well as Jamaica. 
Anything designed by Ryan Laukat will fit the bill for this one. **Above and Below** and **Islebound** are the two getting the most talk recently.

**Mystic Vale** has fantastic art and is a good game if you're looking for something light and quick.

There's also the new print of **Mexica**
**Kanagawa** is currently on my must buy list because of the really nice artwork, and because it looks very fun. It is also a game about painting, so that might be a plus for your friend.
**Legends of Andor**


**Champions of Midgard**


**Arcadia Quest**


**Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn**
Sea of clouds has great art IMO. 


I enjoy the art in small world, but it's a bit more cartoon, and less beauty. 
**Evolution**, **Blood Rage**, **Five Tribes** (especially the djinns)
The **LOTR LCG** has very nice original art, especially if you like the theme. But definitely my favorite art in a card game.
**Castles of Burgundy** (I kid!). Actually I'll go with **Scythe**. 
Arboretum. Looks great, fun game. That'd get a vote from me.
**Kodama: The Tree Spirits**

**Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn**? Its called Ashes nevertheless.

**TIME Stories**
Dixit and Mysterium are both stunning games.
**Mascarade** - Card art is amazing
I love the art in **Istanbul.**  

**Scythe**, of course.  Scythe is gorgeous.  (I guess it's not technically in print right now?  It's not what I think of as "out of print.")

Everything about **Kemet** is beautiful.  I love the minis.  I think it probably has the most visually appealing minis of any game that I have.  Kemet also is just extravagant: the board is beautiful, you have colorful d-4s marking the level of your tech trees *just because they could.* 
* Inis
* Scythe
* Time Stories
* Blood Rage
* Dead of Winter
* Ashes Rise of the Phoenixborn
* Lewis and Clark
**Fresco** ? 

Not only having great artwork, it is about artworking.
Right now I'm absolutely enthralled with **The Others: 7 Sins** the monster design is the most disgusting, grotesque and unique I've seen recently.

I love it. 
**Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards: Duel at Mt. Skullzfyre**

Hey, the artwork is stunning. Just in a... different way.
I recently started playing Dragon & Flagon. The artwork on the board itself is gorgeous with some great Easter eggs (the blood on the floor, the carvings on the tables that say things like "Bonocoure 1 Vasal 0"), and the characters are suitably cartoonish that it makes you feel like you're playing a Tom & Jerry cartoon. It's a great game in general, but the really helps make it.

Smash Up has some really nice artwork, as well. I could stare at some of the cards all day, they're nice and have a painterly look to them.
I would say Valeria Card Kingdoms is a beautiful, lightweight, and fun game.

Let us know what you decide on!
Above and Below and Scythe are the two most beautiful looking games I own.
**Tides of time or tides of madness**, its cheap, a micro game, not many cards but the art is really detailed and the oversized cards complements the art

If you have more budget, then **Mysterium** has the whole package, art and components, easy for new gamers 
All of BattleCon after War of Indines (War of Indines: Remastered, Devastation of Indines, Fate of Indines) and Argent: the Consortium.
The Gallerist. 
I think this goes without saying, but Takenoko has amazing art.
Well to be fair, there are people in *real life* who want to bone anthropomorphic animals...including mice. I don't see it as much of a stretch.
It's all biology. Mouse pheromones affecting his mouse body.
In which chapter does this happen?
Does anyone else....
Is that really the name of the haunt?
This ***probably*** isn't what you're looking for, but if your son loves making his own games, you may want to consider helping him put together a prototyping kit. It's nothing fancy. It can start with several packs of note cards, plastic card sleeves, markers, grid paper, chipboard (I save all of my cereal boxes), rulers, various types of cutting tools, and tons and tons of fun little widgets. You can order bulk bags of meeples and wooden cubes, and you can walk into Dollar stores and craft shops and find lots of things that can spark a creative mind. Some folks like to raid charity shops and yard sales for games to cannibalize for components. Everything from dice, to pawns, to chips, to little pewter Scotty dogs.

On top of that, there are some products available that are marketed as components they can be used for dozens and dozens of games, like the way a Poker deck (also called a standard French deck or standard 52 card deck) or Dominoes are. They are often cleverly designed with solid statistical underpinnings that can give you lots of neat ways to experiment with your own designs without having to do statistical distributions or spend hours coloring on cards. Here are some suggestions:

**[Looney Pyramids / Pyramid Arcade](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/187988/pyramid-arcade)** - the Pyramids come in three nesting sizes and many different colors. With a few "stashes" of Pyramids and some glass beads or a deck of cards, you can play hundreds of games and easily come up with your own. These are great ways to explore designing games and finding inspiration. The **Pyramid Arcade** is a box that contains a lot of "Greatest Hits" along with lots of fun components that work well together and can be used to play with new concepts and designs. 

**[Piecepack / The Infinite Board Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1466589/infinite-board-game-review)** - Piecepack is a similar toolset. Piecepack is to boardgames as Poker decks are to card games, or at least that's their angle. It's essentially a specification the lays out the types and values of the pieces, so anyone can make their own. The Infinite Board Game is a somewhat spotty mass market version that you can find on Amazon or at Barnes and Noble.

**[Decktet](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37301/decktet)** / Non-French Decks of Cards - I just wanted to point out that there are lots and lots of decks of cards out there that aren't the standard 52 card, 4 suit, 13 rank decks most folks know. [Tarot](https://www.pagat.com/tarot/) (non-mystical) decks are a lot of fun to play with and have a long history. Most printing companies that print board games use standard dies that cut cards printed 56 to a sheet. You'd be surprised how many games on the market can be fairly easily broken down into a 4 suit, 13 rank, 54 card structure, and that's because the designer started with a deck of playing cards and a marker. 

**[Blank Game Boards](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005T3NWOY)** - After you move beyond drawing on graph paper, you can go to a board like this. Most of them have a glossy finish that you can often get away with grease pencil or even dry/wet erase markers. (I can't specifically vouch for the one linked.)

But really, for many people, the first bit of designing a game is about having an idea and enough stuff at hand to very rapidly get the idea out of your head and onto the table. I counsel the Game Design Merit Badge for Scouts and it's super fun to cut a group of young people loose on a table covered in components that are bristling with possibility.
You could look at **Junk Art**. Its a game with lots and lots of colorful pieces and even in the game there are a few ways to play with them and your kid could easily come up with new games using the pieces. Also they are all wooden and they look cool. 
Lego makes a few board games where you are encouraged to  alter the game as you wish. I have the lego pyramid games. 
This? https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Own-Game-Board/dp/B00EX8GKQS
Uh... **504**?

/u/r2d8 getinfo
In my games development introduction class, our professor gave us a project to make our own game prototype through a pen and paper prototype. Anything goes but must be made with A4 pieces of paper and not printed.

If your kid is more of a storyteller, I find  that exposing him to the old choose your own adventure books a great pathway to introduce narrative and choice structure.
On boardgamegeek there is a sub called something like games in the classroom. There is a woman in that guild who teaches game design at her school. All her students make games and she photographs them and puts them in the guild with a description. I mention this because the games are made with paper and markers and some pieces like dice or beads. I mention it cause if you check it out, if you find her posts, you can maybe have your child draw inspiration from it and see that you don't need the professional pieces for a game, maybe just purchase those pieces once you have a functioning game you like.
**Covert** - Not a big fan. Too many moving parts and superfluous mechanics. This game is also my nominee for the stuffing question posed above.

**Dominion** - I played this one a few times a couple years ago, and it didn't strike me as memorable. Just kind of middle of the road. I'm currently going through my collection to get rid of some games, and came to this. We played it in an effort to see if it's a keeper or not. It was fun enough that I think I'll hold on to it for a while. I hear this gets better with expansions, so if anyone has suggestions for the best ones, let me know!

**Patchwork** - Loved it. The balance of income and filling your quilt is a tough one to master. I look forward to a lot more of this game. 
I've been away with my family for a long weekend, and was able to introduce them to:

**Monopoly Deal**

**No Thanks**

**Seven Dragons**

**Cockroach Poker**

**Under My Bed**

Those are in order of rough preference. Deal has proved to be a big hit, with No Thanks good at first but then tiring of it eventually. My mum likes Seven Dragons far more than my brother, who struggled to get his head round it.

Cockroach Poker I think needs a few more people to really get going, and Under my Bed definitely - like Spyfall, you can often guess in the first turn based on the question and answer.
Played a bunch this week. All with just the family (as usual), the wife, son (8)and daughter (4) . 

* **roll for the galaxy** had a blast with this game. played 6-7 times @ 2 and 3 player vs different combinations of my wife and son. Lost every time playing with different strategies.  Was paying very little attention to what they were doing outside of the phase selections, and was surprised almost every time at my apparent total failure. 

* **castles of burgundy** again 2 player with my son and 3 player with wife joining (for the first time with this game)  everyone enjoyed, and am excited to get some 2 player in with my wife.  (by the way i lost every game of this as well) 

* **klask mega marathon** daughter and i played like 50 games, at least. She is surprisingly good, but i still managed to take her out at the knees.  
After 2 1/2 months of almost no games played due to moving cities I FINALLY got to play! Yay!  I attended my first BGG con and tried to make up for lost time. I'll try to keep this short-ish.  

 


**Lotus** - First game played. It's really beautiful and I'm tempted to buy it just because of that. We played four player. I found turn order to be quite tough. Going last definitely seem to be a disadvantage. Half way through the game I figured out how to compensate but it put me off a bit.  


**Mystic Vale** - Played with Expansion. Game was better than I expected. Glad I picked up a copy a few months ago.   

**Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle** - I played this solo with 2 hands. Well themed. But quite boring. Glad to have tried it but I will pass.  

**Islebound** - LOVED this game. Can't wait to play it again.   

 

**Aeon's End (Demo)** - Had a demo of this with the designer. I kickstarted this and while I think there are a lot of interesting mechanism I did find the game a bit clunky. I'm a bit worried I won't get this played as much as I'd like.   

**Glory to Rome** - I managed to finally get a hold of a copy and wow... I also really liked this game. I liked it better than Mottainai. The pace somehow was better. I also found the theme seemed to match up better with the mechanisms. Because of that I found it easier to learn.  


**Onitama** - Nice, quick breezy fun.  


**Seasons** - Another beautiful game I've always wanted to play. I'm sort of on the fence about it. Mostly I enjoyed it.   


**T.I.M.E Stories** - Played through the first case. Took us 3 runs to finish it. We actually solved the finaly step pretty quickly. Can't wait to move onto the second case.  


**Dream Home** - It was OK. I don't think I would buy this as a gateway. I found it a bit too simple.  

**Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu** - As Pandemic _was_ my gateway I think this version would be an amazing Gateway. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this. I'm going to replace my vanilla Pandemic with this.  


**Conan(Demo)** - Sooooooo yeah.. I won't get into the categorization of women here cause I think that Shut up and Sit Down covered it well. But I was still curious as to how it played. I will say the game play is actually quite fantastic! I loved the crystals. The whole system is smooth like butter.  I won't be purchasing it myself but I look forward to the reskin whenever that happens. The theme doesn't work for me but the game play is really great. 

**Clank!** - Fun. I died before getting out of the dungeon. Whaaa


**Fabled Fruit**  - Last game I played at the con. Unfortunately it was sold out by the end. I actually quite enjoyed it. A lot more engaging than I expected.  

Really tried to get in a play of **Railroad Revolution** but the table was never empty:(  

>Questions  


* I'm thankful for discovering this hobby 3 years ago. It's truly been life changing. I've met so many great people.  











**Space Alert** -- Been a frequent one for us recently.  If you  haven't played it before, it's a real-time co-op programming game.  You have 10 minutes to figure out how to stay alive in a spaceship with all kinds of bad stuff that can happen.  Would highly recommend it for a group of 4 or 5 people!  

**Castles of Burgundy** -- This game just gets better with every play-through.  With 2 people it is just a joy, no wonder it is ranked so highly on BGG.  If you're someone who gets severe analysis paralysis, I'd steer clear though.  There are tons of possible decisions every turn.

Also, we are very thankful for all our friends and family who gather around (especially at Thanksgiving) and play together.  Friends who game together, stay together.
**Battle for Sularia** we had play testing for the next release coming this spring

**Mechs vs. Minions** played mission three I believe it was.

**Bloodbourne** good little Lang game but not my favorite 

**Star Wars: Destiny** played in the Pre-Release

**Pompeii: Wrath of Vesuvius** good area control game we are publishing.

**Mystic Vale** might be one of my favorite tableau games
This week was BGG.CON, so I played a ton of games, though not as many as I would have liked.

* **The Flow of History** - It keeps getting better every time I play.  The sniping mechanism is maddening and brilliant.  You can never afford to stop trying to figure out what your opponents are trying to do, which to me is a hallmark of a great game.
* **Colony** - **Machi Koro**, only fun.  It's **Age of Craft** with the broken stuff fixed.  A seemingly light game that is full of decisions that are not only hard but *computationally* hard, which means that you have to go by feel a lot of the time.  Looking forward to playing this one a lot.
* **Pyramidos** - One of many Haba dexterity/kids' games we played, this one involves poking a marble out of a hole in the board and trying to roll it towards another, and was way more fun than that sounds.  Its completely impossible endgame condition - get one marble resting atop a base of four others by poking it into the air from underneath - turned out to not be too impossible for me to achieve.  I AM MIGHTY.
* **Lorenzo the Magnificent** - Similar to **Grand Austria Hotel** with the spatial component swapped out for pure engine building.  Definitely worth playing again, though it's not a game I feel the need to own.
* **Ponzi Scheme** - The good news is that the TMG edition is every bit as good as the original.  The bad news is that the group I was with didn't really get it, and one person ran himself very low on money while another pushed the end of the game even though she wasn't winning.  Well, that happened.
* **Monzart** - Unspeakably bad.  I think it would be a bad game even if the rules had been written properly before they were machine-translated into English.  I really can't figure out why this game even exists.
* **Pick Me Up!** - A speed/reaction/perception game designed for Korean schoolchildren, who are self-evidently faster and more perceptive than American adults.  Quite fun, especially with the squeaker/suction cup things that you use to either pick up the matching tiles or signal that you don't think there are any left.
* **Dale of Merchants 2** - Really, really unusual deck-building game.  Opaque for most of our one play - even more so than **Valley of the Kings** was at first.  I'll be getting this, and the original.
* **Letter Tycoon** - Pretty good make-a-word game with lovely (and weird) industrial art.  Too much downtime.  Don't play it with 4.
* **Unfair** - Well, they told you it was unfair.  Mechanically interesting tableau-building game with what seems like a lot of avenues to victory, but a surfeit of take-that mechanisms.  Perhaps if it took 30 minutes to play we'd have been happier with the arbitrariness of the endgame, but at 4x that it was not a positive experience.  The rulebook is altogether more pleased with itself than it deserves to be.
* **Ice Cool** - Entertaining dexterity game, and one that I'm sure one can get very skilled at, though God knows none of us were.  The wobbling penguins are clever and produce funny results.  Very well thought out scoring mechanisms.  The name is a pun so clever we didn't even realize it was a pun until we were putting it away.
* **Imagine** - I suppose you could call this a **Concept**-killer, if Concept needed killing.  The ability to combine symbols directly instead of by reference is for sure a real improvement, and unlike Concept it seemed to work well as a game.  One of us came up with a lightning-round concept - take a card and solve as many words on it as you can in three minutes - that made the last round super fun.
* **Junk Art** - The best building game you can buy right now.  It's basically an iteration on **Bausack**, only the proliferation of possible play modes has been turned from a vague bug into a defining feature, as you choose three sets of rules at random and accumulate your score across all three.  The blocks are really well designed (some blocks fit together perfectly, others really, REALLY don't), and the use of cards and colors provide all kinds of interesting ways to control which pieces get played next, and by whom.  There are speed games, bidding games, screw-your-neighbor games, and it all works.
* **Capital** - Solid city-building/tile-drafting game, probably the best new-to-me game I played.  It's certainly the only game I've ever played where you discard one tile for WWI and then two tiles for WWII.  The rules are a bit vague, and the iconography needs to be more explicit, so if you get a hold of this look up FAQs online before you play.  This game's really good.

**Railroad Revolution** - Pretty interesting optimisation puzzle type of Euro. I love worker placements with variable worker power so this is right up my alley. Will definitely be playing this again.

**Lorenzo Il Magnifico** - Love how tense the game gets and how that you won't be able to do everything you want. I'm not sure how I feel about all the cards coming out every game though. Will give this a few more tries before deciding.

**Great Western Trail** - Definitely a top 5 game of the year for me. Love the upgrading mechanic and the mini deckbuilding aspect as well. Would love to try different strategies (e.g. building in the hazard area) in future plays.
1. **Pandemic** - My wife and I are just getting into board games and this is our gateway drug. I love the coop angle. We also played with some of her family who enjoyed it as well. I've been looking for other coop style games, so if anyone has a suggestion please let me know!

2. **We Didn't Playtest This At All** - Played this along with #3 at a pre-thanksgiving get-together. Great icebreaker as it forces people to read and chat about the cards

3. **Exoloding Kittens** - See above! Fun little game and travels well, of course

4. **X-Wing** - As I said my wife and I are just getting into board games. I'm a giant star wars nerd, so obviously this appeals to me. This week we picked up the Heroes of the Resistance and Imperial Veterans pack, and I ordered 2x Y-Wings and 1x TIE Inquisitor from the Amazon sales. We're really enjoying learning how the game works, and adding in more rules and things as we go. The first two games we played we didn't use any upgrades/pilots/etc just to get the interactions down. This past game we used upgrades but no secondary weapons, so maybe tomorrow night we can bust out the protons torpedoes!
Clank (4p) - My favorite board game at the moment
[Trajan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102680/trajan): This game is absolutely spectacular. There are so, so, so many different things to think about. The actual process of choosing actions takes about 3 layers of thinking. With that said, it's pretty easy to learn, and a somewhat quick play for the amount of depth it presents.

[Yinsh](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7854/yinsh) Amazing abstract strategy game. This and Arimaa are my two favorite abstracts. I love how this game forces you to constantly readjust your plan, since your opponent can usually mess you up in about 2 moves. Very fun, very quick, easy to learn, hard to master.
**Dungeon Petz** (4p). I feel the 4p game is a bit too crowded. We are all beginners at the game and still bad a strategy but I feel that some spots like the selling platform are just too contested with so many players. 

**King of Tokyo** (4p). Always good fun. So many cowards rerolling hits to avoid getting into Tokyo :)

**Sherlock Holmes: Consulting detective** (2p). Another case down!
Finally had **A Feast For Odin** arrive in the mail. Was really keen to play it since I picked up **Patchwork** and **Caverna** a while ago. Played it a couple of times solo to get down the rules before bringing it out in a group.

To preface: A friend of mine who owns Agricola wanted to play a heavier game (since we were playing **Galaxy Trucker**, **For Sale** and **Alhambra**). I suggested **AFFO**, with two friends who played **Caverna** before.

Well, it ended up being 2.5 hrs after the rules explanation, final totals were 115 (Mr.T who normally wins at **Caverna**), 113 (Me, who final round went to Bear Island instead of building a house), 99 (Mr.C, normally doesnt do great at **Caverna**, but enjoys playing nonetheless) and 87 (Mr.J, who owns **Agricola**). Everyone really enjoyed it and everyone had different plans and strategies. Mr.T didnt even explore any islands, Mr.C missed out on emigrating a bot for 13 points on the last round.

After that we played three rounds of base **Dominion**. Man feels like I havent played it in years. I don't mind it, but it feels a little lackluster these days. I forget how fiddly it is to setup with the randomiser comparatively to play time (after setting/packing **AFFO** even). Even when its a longer game with average action  cards, it seems to drag. But still, just enjoyed playing and socialising.

So I played 2 solo games of **AFFO** and my scores were 87 and 125, then 4p score was 113.
The priorities shift greatly between the two player counts. In 4p, the mountain resources were stripped all the time at the start, then upgrading was constantly taken. In solo, I could alternate between hunting/trapping/resource gathering and upgrading/exploring/developing. Really enjoyed both aspects of the game and can't wait to play more.

**Thanks** to board games to be a medium for enjoyment, fun and an excuse to socialise witb friends and families.

**Half-Baked** organisation in **AFFO**: really great organiser for the tiles... but then baggies for everything else? 


**One Night Ultimate Werewolf**

**Codenames**

**Hive**

**King of Tokyo**
I only played one in-person game this week, but it was pretty awesome: I taught my 3yo how to play **Patchwork** and we got half a game in. It was a lot more fun than playing the bot in the iOS version!

 I also played **Targi** and **Carcassone** on BGA. 
**Discworld:  Ankh-Morpork**:  Love this game.  Easy to learn but with some nice strategy.  We only played once but I figure that once you get to know who the main characters are it'll get even more interesting. 

**Barcelona:  The Rose of Fire**:  The rules are sort of hard to follow but we played 3 times and each time it got better.  There's really a lot going on at the same time and you have to be careful to balance your actions.  I'm a sucker for all of the stylistic elements and the theme fits great with the mechanics and the art's really nice. 

**Carcassonne**:  I never get tired of this game.  

**Costa Rica**:  Cool sorta filler game with a push your luck element.  
**Evolution** 1x 6p, 1x 4p - Recently got this game from the BTGO Free Amazon sale the other week. First game was with two people who havent played modern board games before but they both picked it up really fast. I eneded up having the only sucessful carnivore in the 6p game while the rest of the players were starving. People wanted to play again, so we did later in the week, and everyone wanted to go carnivore. Everyone had a lot of fun imagining our monstrous animals duking it out. Curious to try with Climate sometime.

**Patchwork** 1x 2P - My parents are in town for the holidays and I convinced my mom to play patchwork with me. She was skeptical but really enjoyed it by the end. I hope we can play again sometime soon. Since she moved away we don't do much together anymore.

**Shakespear** 1x 4P - GF had some free time friday so decided to come to a meet up with me, which was a first and glad to say went over well with her. First time playing this game. Was a lot tighter than i thought it would be. We had a lot of laughs, but GF and I both scored pretty low. I'm just glad i got to pay off all my hard working staff in the end.

**Concordia** 1x 4p, 1x 3p - Found out on Friday that this GF's favorite game. I had no idea, it makes me sad to think we've owned her favorite game for over a year and she's only had the chance to play it a couple of times. Hopefully we can change now that we taught it to her sister who enjoyed it immensely as well. Might look into getting the Salsa expansion, not because the game needs it, but because I'm a completionist.

**Cacao** 1x3p - Played with GF and her sister. Another close game between GF and I. Love how the game looks at the end. Another game I'd like to get the expansion for.

**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** 8x 8-12p - Taught it to a bunch of people last night after our friendsgiving. First game didn't seem to catch on, but during the second game, most of the people were hooked. I attribute it to me not being the forensic scientist after the first game and instead being an instigator to get people discussing. As always a lot of fun, a true gem of a game.

**Gobble Gobble** I am really thankful for boardgames giving me the opportunity to pull myself away from technology and screens every now and then to spend time with real people face to face. A few years ago I felt like i was in a rut when i started working and my GF and I were long distance. I felt like i lost the ability to socialize and connect with others, but board gaming has been a great medium for me to come back into a social life and really develop the friendships i have as well as learn how to speak to knew people.

**Stuffing** Betrayal at the House on the Hill and Dead of Winter both feel pretty bloated to me. They are still fun, i just find them both a little fiddly.
**Arboretum** taught it to 2 younger (15 and 9) players.  They loved it.  As do I.  It's great.

**Red7** taught to same players.  I think they found it a bit snooze-inducing.  Alas.

**Can't Stop** same group as listed above.  They enjoyed it, one had played it before.

**Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective** - Lionized Lions case.  We were close in our questions/answers.  Brain burner indeed!

**Quantum** taught my brother-in-law and his girlfriend.  They absolutely loved it.  I gave them my copy since my wife does not enjoy it.

**Patchwork** played a few rounds of this with family members.  All adored it.

Questions:

- A hobby I can obsess over, enjoy with my wife, family and friends.

- Dominion, Magic the Gathering, Carcassonne.
I played 
**The Resistance**- x2 five player game. Good group I was the spy twice, and I am terrible at this game. The other spy carried me. 

**Innovation**- 2 player game, first time playing. I look forward to playing it again 
**Role For the Galaxy** two player game. This was my third play through and I am starting to get a better understanding of how to play. 

**Pandemic**- Three player game with six infection cards. We won. 

**Above and Below**- 3 player game, manged to win thanks to a crazy good rewards for succeeding in completing a really cute story. 

**7th Hero** neat for what it is

**Dead Men Tell no Tales** Not sure what my opinion was. I enjoyed playing it but not something i would pull off a shelf. 

**Machi Koro**- first time playing. It was alright, not my cup of tea. 

**Macao** 3 player game. Got a used copy cheap at a local store. Played my first game last night. Butcherd some rules for the first half of the game but looking forward to a proper play through this week. My wife and i enjoyed it but we did note some flaws ( these may have been from our original rules understanding).

I am thankful for my friends and family this week. Haven't really played a game that is too bloated
Went to BGGCON, so I played a lot. I didn't get to as many hot games as I wanted, but I checked some long time interests off of my list:

**bloodborne** x2, 4p & 3p - It was ok. I feel like i’ve seen all it has to offer 

**raptor** x2, 2p - Scientists won handily both times, but I really enjoyed it. Curious how it balances out with more plays

**tennis masters** x1, 2p - silly dexterity game where you flick foam balls with plastic standee players 

**mega man pixel tactics** x1, 2p - Our introduction to pixel tactics. I really liked it, and I think it would be even better once both players are familiar with the cards.

**ice cool** x1, 3p - dexterity game in which you flip wobbly penguins through doors. Pretty fun, but crokinole is the only dex game for me.

**automania** x1, 3p - great engine building, worker placement, resource management. One of my favorites I played at the convention.

**manhattan project energy empire** x1, 3p - another engine building, worker placement, resource management, and another favorite at the convention. We missed a pretty important rule, which extended the game considerably. Looking forward to playing correctly.

**scoville** x1, 3p - this one was quite a brain burner. I enjoyed it, but not sure everyone in my group would be able to decipher the cross breeding chart, while planning their move.

**fabled fruit** x2, 4p & 5p - surprisingly fun worker placement/set collection. I think it’s a tad overpriced

**happy salmon** x1, 4p - silly and loud game, probably better with a lot more people. Not really my thing

**captain sonar** x1, 8p - everyone but one was new, so we played the turn-based mode to learn. I really liked it, and would like to try it real-time. I’m sure it is insane.

**zooloretto** x1, 3p - i might have liked this, had i not played coloretto first. Coloretto takes the interesting part of the game, and gets rid of the rest.

**deck builder - the deck building game** x1, 2p - quick time killer. I was left feeling indifferent

**onitama** - x2, 2p - Feels a bit like chess with fewer pieces, and I love it. I’m glad it got a reprint with fancier components

**trains** - x1, 3p - played this last year, and wanted to see more. Pretty decent deck builder, i like it.

**istanbul** - x1, 3p - finally got around to trying this. I really liked it, but i’ve heard it can get samey.

**crokinole** - x???, 2p - classic greatness

**android: mainframe** - x1, 3p - area control with some take that!, I would have to be in the right mood to play again. It’s pretty mean, but does not overstay its welcome.

**dragon punch** - x2, 2p - quick freebie, not a bad 2p time killer

**deception murder in hong kong** - x2, 10p? I’ve somehow never tried any of these werewolf style social deduction games. I wouldn’t refuse to play again, but I’m not going to hunt them down, either.

I played this new game my 5 years old received. It's a card game called [Piou Piou](http://imgur.com/EwRuYnt).

Very simple but very fun.

You have 4 type of card a rooster, a hen, a nest and a fox. And many two sided egg/chick cards.

The goal is to get 3 chick.

Each player has 4 cards and draw cards once they've used them

With a rooster, a hen and a nest you can get an egg.

With two hen you can turn your egg into a chick.

With a fox you can steal another players egg. But that player can counter with two rooster.

Too much fun.


**Viticulture + Tuscany exp** 6p - I'm not 100% sold on the expansion.  It adds a mixed bunch of features.  I like the new structure cards, and I like the four seasons, and the special workers.  I feel like the game could do with removing the 6 worker limit now it has four seasons and extra spaces on your player board, and a higher score total.  The six worker limit really feels more like a punishment than a limitation now.  I was completely indifferent towards the stars/map part of the game.  It felt tacked on and doesn't really add anything worthwhile to the game.  Overall it's a good expansion, but a bit hit and miss.

**Roll for the Galaxy** 5p - I've played this a few times now and finally feel like I have a handle on how to perform well.  My first two games were pretty much blindly trying anything and failing miserably.  It's a good game, but not the easiest game to get a feel for.

**Liguria** 4p and 3p - having bought this last week, this is quickly becoming one of my favourite games.  It's such a good mix of mechanics that all feed into each other, making the decisions more meaningful and interesting.  It works well at 3p too, with a much tighter, more race-like feel than 4p.

**Coup** 5-6p - I still suck at this.  I will probably continue to suck at this.  I'll still jump in on a game though.
Monday: **Patchwork**. My fiancée obliterated me 33 to -6. I've never gotten such a terrible score, and I actually thought I was doing well until the end. 

Tuesday: **Keyflower** 5p. Taught the game to two new players. I eked out a victory with 57 points. I still haven't quite figured out the strategy in this game. I think it's *good*, but I don't really get the hype. 

Wednesday: **Patchwork**. Oh how the tables have turned! I won 27 to -8. My fiancée's worst score ever. 

Thursday: **Mottainai** 2p. Hadn't played this one in a while. My fiancée won 39-27. This is a game I definitely need to get to the table more often. There's a depth here I've only begun to crack. 

Friday: **Terra Mystica** 4p. Played with my sister, brother-in-law, and a friend. I played as the Nomads on the flip-side of the expansion board, and edged out a victory *one point* ahead of my brother-in-law. 

Saturday: **Friday**. Just a little solo gaming to kill some hours on a dreary weekend. I lost. 

Sunday: **Ticket To Ride**. Got together with two friends down the street to introduce them to the lovely world of hobby gaming.  
* **Hey, That's My Fish** (3x, 3p) - Super, simple light game. But we got the rules wrong. We started on 3-fish tiles, where the manual says you have to start on 1-fish tiles.

* **Blood Rage** (1x, 3p) - This was only my second time playing Blood Rage. There was also another table of 4 playing Blood Rage, but they took a lot longer to finish (due to player counts, and taking the game more seriously). This game is definitely in my top 10 of all time. Also, I won!

* **Welcome to the Dungeon** (1x, 3p) - This is one of those games I **always** lose, partly due to me being greedy!

* **Beyond Baker Street** (1x, 3p) - A great cooperative game, but **don't** play without the characters like we did (and the manual suggests for your first game). It becomes too hard!

* **Titan Race** (1x, 6p) - Mario Kart in a small sized box! I came 5th.

* **Adrenaline** (1x, 5p) - I do love this game, a Euro area control game that plays like arena deathmatch shooters!

* **Tokaido** (1x, 5p) - A nice relaxing game to play after blasting each other to death in Adrenaline.

* **Hanabi** (1x, 4p) - We scored 17 points in the end. I prefer Beyond Baker Street to this game.

* **Race for the Galaxy** (1x, 1p) - Me versus the robot in The Gathering Storm expansion. I won 55 points to 35.

1. I am thankful to board games because before I took up the hobby, I was pretty much a social recluse, but since then I have met some wonderful people, and come out of my shell a little.

2. I think **Tiny Epic Western** seems to stuff too many ideas together in a small package, and they don't work too well together. The rules seem a little too convoluted.
**Trickerion** - Learning of the Basic game, with 2p, I definitely feel like this game will be much better with the 7 rounds and the Dark Alley in the advances rules. I just didn't feel like I got all i wanted to get done. It is a really tight game and one that while it isn't hard to play, it is definitely an interesting one to teach, lots of little ins and outs.

**Jaipur** - Still really enjoy this game and the push your luck element, do I sell now or wait. My SO other whooped me as I almost always sold a bit too soon.

**Friday** - I really like this game, but now that I have played it a few times i find myself using the same strategy and it just comes down to luck, of which I am not very lucky. This will always be a good game to get a solo fix but, I see it coming out fewer and further between.

**1846** - First time playing... WOW, this had my head swimming as it is the heaviest game i have played to-date... Really interesting decisions to be made and hours passed and it seemed like minutes. Spent the remainder of the night thinking how i might approach my next play, try to improve the current strat if available or go for something completely different. 

1. I am very thankful for the hobby, it has introduced me to some great people and has brought my SO and I closer together as we spend a little bit of time each week playing games.

2. The only game that I can think of at this time is A Feast for Odin, but I don't think that it is too bloated or half-baked. I rather like it. Sorry, I don't have something better. I generally feel that a lot of the games That I have played and been introduced to are quite elegant and refined, guess i have been lucky.
Just picked up **Keyflower** as my playgroup's first foray into more Euro-esque games. For reference, games we previously enjoyed have been Castles of MKL, Ascension ("cube"), Catan: Cities and Knights, Splendor, among others.

Wow, what a great game. I love engine building and the different strategies that are allowed because of it. The worker placement is very interesting, and I'm a fan of the "my village" vs. "your village" dynamic.

Played multiple times at 2, 3, and 5 players... loved every time. Looking forward to playing this game A LOT.

EDIT: Just wanted to add on that I really like how limited the game is, like you never have enough time to do everything that you want to do. If anyone has any tips, tricks, or recommendations on Farmers vs. Merchants, please don't hesitate to reply!
**Castles of Burgundy** 4p, 1x: Played with three new players and it was a big hit. A couple of turns in and everyone was already into the flow of the game and it didn't take as long to play a 4p game as I thought it would. One of the new guys won the game by a couple of points just finishing ahead of me.

**Sushi Go Party** 8p, 2x: Played a couple of different menus and it was a great time had by all. I had mostly ignored this release thinking it was basically the same game as the regular Sushi Go but with added cards to raise the player count. I was so wrong and now my FLGS has a copy on order for me (their already sold out!).

**Castle Panic** 2p, 1x: Play with my 6 year old daughter again. We just lost with only a couple of monsters left on the board. It's so fun that she is starting to grasp all of these game mechanics and is able to play games with the full rule set active.

**Flashpoint** 3p, 1x: My lunch time group has been addicted to **Pandemic** the last few weeks that I thought I'd bring in a different co-op. They thought that it started off slow, and were worried that the game wasn't very challenging. A few turn in and they realised that things can go from good to bad fairly quickly. They ended up really enjoying the experience and, even though the building collapsed on us, they are looking to face the challenge again sometime soon.

**Arkham Horror: The Card Game** 2p, 2x: My son and I have been eager to try this one and finally got to play this weekend. We both love the game. Played the first mission twice on standard difficulty with 2 different characters each. Failed the first time and got resolution 1 on the second attempt. Looking forward to all the expansions and the stories that this game is going to tell.
Celebrating a late birthday, so some lighter games were in order. 

**Hanabi** 4p much much much better than the last time I played with only 2. 

**Coup** 4p x2. This is definitely my least favorite modern game I've ever played. I had a seriously hard time find anything enjoyable about it, yet everyone else loved it. I guess that's what personal preferences are for.

**Between Two Cities** 4p, it was slightly better than when I last played it with only 3, but still 3 of the 4 cities ended up with the same score and once again it came down to the second tie breaker.

**Sushi Go Party** 4p, loved this game, had been wanting to give it a shot for a while. Such a nice (almost) stress free drafter. 
**Get Bit** a fun little filler  
   
**Kingdomino** fun little filler  
  
**Alhambra** fun for some new gamers  
  
**Leo goes to the barber** gaming with the kids  
  
**Stone Age**  playing with the family  
  





I got **Eclipse** and I played it twice, and it's the best game ever.
**Oracle of Delphi** 3p - Not bad but also nothing exciting. I like other Feld games more and have gotten rid of some of those so I doubt I will revisit. 

**Arkham Horror LCG** 2p - Close win. We both enjoyed it. Still a bit undecided if I should invest in a second core set to try 4p or not. Thankfully not a decision to make right now as its pretty much sold out everywhere :) Overall neat mix of other FFG mechanics.

**Star Wars Destiny** 2p about 8 games. I was wary and not sure if I should even attend the pre-release with it being a CCG but watching a couple how-to-play's and reviews during the morning I decided to give it a chance. And it does not disappoint in the slightest. Easy to learn, great feel as well as still tough decisions to make - and if the decks are even there is lots of tension. I got very lucky that I was able to snag 4 starters and 24 boosters so I have been able to do some limited deck building since then and try some different things which I enjoyed very much - and I usually dont like building decks that much (reason I stopped playing LOTR LCG). Highly recommended - if you can deal with it being a CCG.

Two downsides I can see. I dont know how many people I will have to play with where I live and a new booster release every 3-4 months might turn out to be too much for me.



**Welcome Back to the Dungeon** 3p x1 - As fun as the original Welcome to the Dungeon, though the powers are a bit wackier. I get the feeling that if they try to add even more to the game, it'll take it over the edge, but this is still a good, fun filler game.

**Mechs vs Minions** 4p x 2 - Played the Tutorial to get everyone up to speed, as well as the first scenario. Tons of fun! One of our players turned his mech into a marching death machine, which worked great up until the point he marched himself to the end of the board and could not turn around. I can see this getting even crazier and more challenging, but so far it's a great programming game that I'm sure I will be playing more of.

**Dead of Winter: The Long Night** 5p x 1 - Played the Raxxon introduction scenario and holy crap. Every turn felt like we were just on the edge of failing, and when the special Raxxon zombies came out it pushed us right off the cliff into the spiky pit of death below. Still had a ton of fun with it, it'll definitely be seeing more play in the future.

1. I'm thankful I have a hobby that I can use as an excuse to bring people over and have fun. I wasn't much for hosting events at my place before, but now I have a monthly event at my place.

2. I touched on this, but I think Welcome Back to the Dungeon is right on the edge. If they did a Welcome Back to the Dungeon Again (TM), I'd probably pass.
Betrayal House on the Hill, finally got it to the "table" (we played it on the floor because we don't have a big table). Had a lot of fun, I became the betrayer in #42 and narrowly won. Even got my dad to play with us don't think hes ever played a game like that, he said he liked it. We also played saboteur1+2 and bohnanza. 
**Lifeboat** which was quirky but didn't really rouse my fancy. 

**Unspeakable Words** where going insane has some positives. I won the game while insane and rolling for a word over 16 points. 


I bought Eldritch Horror, which I'll probably be playing solo. I really like it so far after one game and starting a second.
Looking at Arkham Horror LCG now too, but if I go for it it will definitely push back my playing The LOTR LCG which I have barely touched.
We had a friendsgiving and played some party/social deduction games:


* **Spyfall** (4-8 players) - People were joining and leaving, and then new people were coming, so we just played multiple rounds of this game. It's a relatively easy game that people picked up on quickly. Some were able to ask better questions sooner than others, but by maybe the third game or so, everybody could balance the right amount of vague and specific in their questions and answers. We implemented a house rule for when we had a large group of people -- we ask in a circle first to make sure that everybody gets asked at least one question within the 8 minutes. I think the spy always won in our rounds, but the game was still fun. It invoked the right amount of shouting and debating :)


* **Sheriff of Nottingham** (4-5 players) - Apparently, my friends and I just love lying to each other! We played this one because it was the most relevant-to-Thanksgiving game we had (bringing food and/or drinks into Nottingham), and really, it was just an excuse to play the game. Many of us play the game to throw in chaos rather than focus on winning, so it made the game fun when we had liars and smugglers. The winners were always the ones who played it straight though!


Special mentions: I had kickstarted **Pod-X** and added on **Avignon: A Clash of Popes**, and they arrived this week. I hadn't played a real game of it, but my SO and I did a play-test to learn the rules. Loving the portable pocket-sized "cases" that they come in!


-------------------------------------------------


* I am thankful that having game nights has made me a better presenter at work. I did a post a few days ago about how I had to explain my research study to some representatives of our sponsors, and I found that it was similar to introducing a  new board game to my friends!


* I'm still trying to learn how to play **Crimson Creek**, but I'm finding that I have too many little trinkets in the tin. I appreciate that the creator of the game was trying to give me the most bang for my buck, but I ended up feeling confused. **Kodama** also had these little spirits that you can "hang" on your tree that you built if you win the game, but it was unnecessary.
**Ticket to Ride: Europe** (5p) - I've only ever played vanilla TTR, and only on the app. It was ok, I prefer the basic one, the luck of laying Tunnels annoyed me as I got burnt a couple of times.

**Port Royal** (5p) - Managed to achieve my lowest ever score of 1, got hit by tax a couple of times and never really got going.

**Beasty Bar** (4p) - First go at this and it was pretty fun, only really got the hang of what all the cards did by the end, need to play again.

**Mage Knight**(1p) - **Loved This**, bought at the weekend as I was looking for something that plays solo and you can get your teeth into. First time playing this, spent my saturday learning the rules, which took time, but the rule books are good and there are plenty of run-throughs on youtube - then did the first intro mission. Then on Sunday did the first solo campaign. Took about 5hrs, beat one city and reached the second but ran out of time (and was severely underpowered). Need to play again and do it better this time. Going to try and play this as much as I can, then might try and tempt someone for a coop once I know the rules inside out.
**Pathfinder ACG - Mummy's Mask** (2p; 4 characters) - More of the same, but a refreshing change from Wrath's huge numbers and overpowered characters.

**Pandemic - The Cure** (4p, then 2p; but always 4 characters) - 2 wins and 5 losses, and we play regular Pandemic with its expansions a lot.  Still figuring this one out, but it's hard to come back from the medic rolling 3 biohazards at the start.

**Warhammer Quest - Adventure Card Game** (4p) - Introduced 2 friends to this game, and one liked it so much he bought it (before it goes out of print).  Have played it many times previously, and it's a shame this game is discontinued, it's mechanically very clean.
**Clank** (4p) - Loved the game, really can't go wrong with Deck building with me...

**Champions of Midgard** (4p) - Worker placement, another mechanic I love, while I liked the game, I felt that it kinda fills the same niche as Lords of Waterdeep, and I would rather play the latter.

**The Big Book of Madness** (5p) - Another deck building, so I obviously enjoyed, though it feels almost like a filler...

**Terra Mystica** (5p) - I could go on and on about this one... I have over 100 games played online of TM, so I'm quite biased in favor of it...

**Celestia** (5p) - Beautiful game, and fun little filler, not much to say about it

**Potion Explosion** (3p) - Fun little game, though to me most of the fun is gimmicky, from the chain explosions, but there is some depth of strategy, especially when to take the professor's favor (which IMO is almost always haha)

**Skull** (6p) - Fun filler, the game ended with everybody getting eliminated (I guess that says a lot about my group of people), but it was intense, at the end the 2 last players both had one point but only 1 card left.

Was fortunate enough to have 2 days of boardgames this week, which is awesome
**[Las Vegas](https://www.amazon.ca/Ravensburger-Las-Vegas-Family-Game/dp/B00ARSDWG4)** (4p) - never played this one before. It's mostly dice based, with some betting and strategy involved. Lot of potential for grudges, but it's a very quick game.

**Lords of Waterdeep** (5p) - one of my favourite games. We played with 4 people, and 2 of them hadn't played before and it's really easy to pick up on. I do notice that it's easy to forget stuff at the start of rounds since the kind of stuff in play can vary from game to game. We had a lot of buildings with the "at the start of the round" conditions, and sometimes we'd miss them. Really gotta keep track of them.

**Gobble Gobble** - thankful for having a great outlet to hang out with friends.
**Targi** (2x 2p) - Wow what a fantastic little game.  I really love its twist on worker placement mechanics.  This game fits the bill for times when we have the itch to play an euro game but don't feel like investing in the hours and mental fortitude required of a full game. 

**Tuscany:EE** (3x 2p) - My wife and I already love Viticulture, and we didn't think the game could get any better.  We were wrong.  This expansion adds to an already great game and I can't wait to play more.

**Feast for Odin** (1x 1p) - Just received my copy yesterday. Played a round of solo game and ...believe the hype!  I can't wait to teach my wife how to play.  I predict this game will hit the table very often.

**Gobble Gobble:** I'm thankful to board games because it allowed me to bond with my wife.  After work, I like to kick back and play video games, however, in doing so, I'd neglected my wife (since she's not into video gaming).  I introduced her to board gaming and I'm glad she enjoys it as much as I do.  Now we have an activity in common where we're both enjoying with each other.
**Dead of Winter** (5p) - Played the Too Many Mouths scenario, and got *so close* to winning. But we got cocky and chose to take a morale hit during a Crossroads card, and then didn't make the final crisis. It was devastating.

**Secret Hitler** (7p)  - First time playing this! Liberals won easy the first game, and I unfortunately had to leave after just the one. Hopefully I can scoop this up on its second printing.

**Love Letter** (4p) - Perfect kill-time-until-pizza-gets-here game.

**One Night Ultimate Werewolf** (4p) - This is becoming such a standby for my wife and I whenever we have two or more people over. We taught it to another couple and after just a couple practice rounds they were bluffing just as well as us. Brought a tear to my eye :')

Edit: Too =/= Two
I had a gaming party this past weekend. Had about 10 of us, and we played the following, not in any order:

1:) Codenames
2.) Bang!
3.) Betrayal at House on the Hill
4.) Coup
5.) Sherrif of Nottingham
6.) Mecs Vs Minions
7.) Bloodborne
8.) Suro

Was a BLAST!
**Scythe** (4p) First four player game of Scythe. I was Saxony and had a good early game but because I didn't want to be too aggressive and make two new players frustrated, I didn't attack at key times when I should have (I had 3 mechs when only one other player had one mech). I ended up losing because I lost all momentum, then Rusviet steamrolled using 8 workers and their economy. Saxony is a fun faction but you absolutely need to be aggressive to win. Next time I won't go easy on them :P

**Smallworld** (4p) Love this game, I have played it before but it has been a while. Very interesting with four players. I'd recommend the expansion due to having more combinations. Fun, forgiving, easy to learn, enough tactical depth to remain interesting.

**Dead of Winter** (4p) Even while this was my most enjoyable game of DoW, it still doesn't grab me as much as I had hoped when I first bought it. 

* **Stuffing**  DoW manages to paint a wonderfully believable and mature apocalypse, it's just too bad you don't get to experience it all that much. The main objective often dictates the game's direction too much IMO, while leaving little in the way of exploring the wonderful encounters and other scenarios that can happen. The main objectives can also be very unintuitive, such as sitting on the same two locations and depleting their item decks? That's not exactly what I would call "fun." Many of the main objectives can be achieved by moving all characters to where they need to be in the first round of play, then simply completing the necessary actions to win, with minor movements here and there. Many of the characters are relegated to the exact same set of tasks every round, such as the cook who can make food (and is an excellent defender of the colony as well). But this means that the player who has the cook must use 2 of their die every round just doing "upkeep," and they don't get to explore the game. At a certain point you have to wonder why that person even needs to "play" when you could have their character do what they're doing without anyone playing them at all. Without going overboard, I'll just say that DoW could do a lot more to give individual players options and make them feel like they are a part of the game, rather than making them feel like an action die drone, relegated to the same BS every round. 

**Gobble Gobble**  I'm thankful for the endless hours of enjoyment boardgames have brought me while being social. Video games are a solo venture, while boardgames are a comradery venture.
Had a couple friends over and they brought **Above and Below**. That was some good fun. Nice combo of simple and strategic, plannable and random.

Later that night I clobbered my partner on **Carcassonne**. We had the time to play with Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders and the Hills & Sheep expansions. Board was gigantic by the time we finished. I'd made a risk very early in the game of dropping a farmer. She was never able to get any farmers in the same field to even tie up with me, so, along with the Pig, I rocked nearly 100 points just from one farmer.

I'm thankful that boardgames give me a structured interaction. I like friends just fine, but I just don't very much enjoy endless chatter. Laying out a boardgame provides the perfect focus and a start and end point.


This week, I played a game of **Dixit** and then three games of **Codenames: Dixit**. This makes me eager to pick up **Codenames: Pictures** at some point as it was definitely challenging but equally fun to match pictures as words.
**Coup** - Played a BUNCH of rounds with my wife and her best friend on Wednesday. First time playing for her friend, our second time playing. My wife was tired and got crabby when she didn't win the first few (she's competitive) but then she got into it. We all had a blast.

**Lost Cities** - The aforementioned friend of my wife brought this over, it was my first time playing it. I read the rules and wasn't expecting much but when I started playing it was actually really enjoyable, more strategy and mind games than I expected. I'm not sure what kind of staying power it will have but I really enjoyed making my choices in that game.

**Splendor** - it's a standby at this point. I tried a new strategy this week of hoarding gems, reserving point cards and ONLY buying point cards. I won by a landslide (3p game), but I suspect my wife at least will catch on to this strategy pretty quickly. But it's been a fun little change for now :)

**Munchkin** - Taught this game to my young nephew (~11yrs) and played it with him and my two teenage sisters. Good simple fun, and the nephew won the game which was a great thrill for him.

**Catan** - it has been a long time since I played this, especially with 4 players, but we all settled in comfortably and had a great, close game. I got longest road early on and kept it, my wife got largest army and kept it. I had a lucky streak getting access to some good wool tiles and building several settlements on them (including a wool harbor), then played a wood monopoly at just the right time to turn my road into a wool and wheat empire. Every turn had me raking in large amounts of either resource and I could trade for anything I wanted. Won with a Library card. It was a lot more fun with Catan than I've had in ages.

**Game of Thrones LCG, 1st Edition** - Picked this up at the Fantasy Flight Game Center holiday sale over the weekend. Spent $20 and got the core set ($15) and five chapter packs ($1 each, Epic Battles, Ancient Enemies, Refugees of War, Sacred Bonds and Mountains of the Moon). Keeping an eye out for the Greyjoy & Martell expansions to go on sale/be in stock, then we should be able to build 3-4 fun decks! Not looking to keep up with the meta of the second edition or pay lots of money when we have so many other games.

Wife and I played it last night, she was House Stark and I was House Targaryen. She smoked me, it wasn't even close. Every phase she just raked in power. It's a good thing, now she'll play again :D

EDIT: forgot a game
I playtested a game I designed with several groups of friends! I'm thankful that this hobby has exploded, providing me with tons of inspiration. I'll try to keep my game unstuffed - the plan is for a round to take less than 15 minutes.
**Carcassonne** (2p, 3p)- Just got this game recently and it's pretty fun, simple, and quick. I introduced fields to my friend, and he destroyed me. Then, a second friend arrived but wasn't really paying attention when I tried to explain fields. Somehow, though, he handily beat me and my other field friend. It was kind of funny- both of us were confident we would win but somehow just didn't get enough points from our fields to overcome his massive city-induced lead. I think we were fighting over fields too much and lost other sources of points.

**Red7** (3p, x2): We played this game while waiting for everyone else to show up. I like this game a lot even though my friends complain that it's too luck-based.

**7 Wonders** (6p, x1): This game is really fun but I'm usually teaching it so my fun is diluted by constantly answering stupid questions. I'm also bad at it. My friend (who hadn't played before) won by quite a lot by getting smallish amounts of points from a ton of different sources.

**Carcassonne** (4p, x1): Played this again but this time at school without fields. Several people had to swap out over the course of the game so it was a bit chaotic.

**Pandemic** (2p, x1): We played this with six epidemic cards but we chose our roles. We were really close and it looked like an easy win but it escalated really quickly at the end and we lost because of a chain of outbreaks near Shanghai.

**Mechs vs. Minions** (4p, x2): We played through missions 2 and 3. It was a little bit anticlimactic and mission 3 was pretty easy, but it was still good minion-slaughtering fun. I'm paranoid that I forgot a bunch of rules, though.

**Hanabi** (4p, x1): 19 points. I think this is either my record or my second best score. We aren't good at Hanabi :(

**Coup** (3p, bunch of times): I hate this game because I've played it *so damn much*. It was one of my first hobby games and I took it on several school trips so I've played it more than enough times. I don't feel like it has anything new to offer me. My friends like it, though, so I'm often stuck playing it.
My partner and I took **Hanabi** and **Hive** out on a date night and got one play of each. Gotta love having portable games.

I also got the **Splendor** app from the Humble Mobile Bundle and have been playing that. I'm absolutely lousy against the AI, but I'm still having a good time.

But, most excitingly, *my group finished* **Pandemic Legacy**!! We finished November sometime last month, and have been on the edge of our seats waiting for the opportunity to blitz through December.  It was a wild experience, and now that we're done, I've gotta say that playing this game was easily the most fun I've had with board games.

---

In response to question #1, I'm really thankful for a partner who is as enthusiastic about board games as I am. When we're going out for a date, she'll often be the first to ask, "Should we bring a game?" She sits down and endures my clumsy rules explanations so we can try new games.  It's just so dang lovely--and, I suppose, on the flip side, I'm thankful to board games for giving me such an enjoyable, dynamic thing to share with my partner.
**Catan** (1 x 4p): Although it remains my most-played game overall, this was actually the first time I'd played Catan in 8 months. My friend rode an early brick-stone city plus longest road to victory, while I came in 2nd with 7 points. Nice to knock out a 4p game in about 40 minutes!

**Coup** (3 x 4p): My most played game this year. Snuck in a win in the first game...which prompted others to assassinate me quickly in the next two :/ While I still enjoy this one, it's definitely dropped a bit against other social deduction games (namely **Spyfall**).

**Carcassonne** (2 x 2p): Played two games back-to-back. After winning the first one, I was leading in a close second game...until I casually placed a single tile that gave 42 points worth of farming to my gf. Despite my frustration, I'm really impressed at how this game still reveals new strategies after 20+ plays.

**Dragonwood** (1 x 2p): Obviously I'm biased, but I think this game works great as a light-yet-thematic filler. Underrated in my opinion!

**Dominion** (1 x 2p): After only owing the base game for a year, I recently picked up Intrigue and Prosperity. We almost always use some sort of action forker (i.e. Village), but didn't this time, which was a nice change of pace. I love the Platinum and Colonies that Prosperity adds...but man, do they extend the game length! This one took us well over an hour.

**Scythe** (1 x 4p): The hype is deserved. I'm honestly not sure a game has ever stuck in my head afterward as much as this one did. So immersive, highly thematic, and stunningly beautiful (I could just stare at the board and cards for hours). I got absolutely crushed, finishing last out of four players with 26 points (to the winner's 59)...but really enjoyed the game flow and the variety packed into the box. I'm already stoked to give this one another shot.

*This week it's Thanksgiving (in the U.S.), what are you thankful to board games about?*

This could easily be an essay-length answer...but I'll start with my immense thankfulness for--somehow, miraculously--landing a full-time job in the board game industry this year. After some really tough experiences in school and in jobs that weren't a good fit, I'm beyond lucky to have landed with a company so dedicated to taking care of its customers and employees alike. I don't mean to sound like a Gamewright shill...but it really is a genuine pleasure to spend each day working here.

On top of that, I've met and played games with dozens of new people this year. Gaming has gotten me to socialize more in general, attending meetups without knowing anyone beforehand, as well as spending more quality time with friends and family. It's been an amazing year of discovery, and I can't wait to see how it continues!
- **Patchwork** (2p, 3x) - I've been wanting to try this one for a while, as I do most of my gaming with my fiancee. We played it at our FLGS and had a good time with it - it was frustrating to have negative scores for the first couple of games, but I think we're finally catching on to the right balance of speed, buttons, and space on the board. Doesn't replace **Jaipur** as our go-to 2p game, but it's a good effort by Uwe.

- **Betrayal at House on the Hill** (6p, 1x) - Played with some friends at our FLGS and had a pretty good time. It's beautiful and highly thematic, but I generally prefer mechanics over theme, and that's where the game falls short. Because of the way our characters had moved around the house, we were caught unprepared by the Haunt and the Ouroboros slaughtered us in 3 turns. Still had fun, but I would probably only play this game again as part of a horror-themed game night.

- **Nevermore** (3p, 2x) - A filler weight Poe-inspired drafting/set-collection game where players try to collect the most of any one of 5 different suits of cards, each of which grants an ability such as attacking, healing, or gaining access to special "magick" cards. A fun little diversion and another good horror night game to consider.

- **Jupiter Rescue** (3p, 1x) - A wonderful little cooperative game where the players are robots trying to evacuate humans from a space station that is rapidly filling with zombielike "creeps". I really enjoyed this one, and though many of the mechanisms ape **Pandemic**, I did feel like this game had a little more soul (though probably less replayability). The minis look great on the table and the theme is wonderfully integrated. Highly recommended for coop fans.

- **Broom Service** (3p, 2x) - An expansion and reimplementation of **Witch's Brew**, I really enjoyed this one. It combines role selection, pickup-and-deliver, and press-your-luck mechanisms beautifully, and adds some meat to an older game that, in my opinion, really needed it. I'd love to pick this one up soon.
_________________________________________________


1. I'm thankful to board games for adding a new, competitive dimension to my relationship with my fiancee. She doesn't play video games, so our board game time is really special.

2. Stuffing - I tend to like heavier games, but I don't appreciate when filler games masquerade as something more. The biggest offender that I can think of is **Lost Cities: The Board Game**, and even many expansions for **Catan**. They add significantly to play time, but not necessarily to the depth or overall experience. 
I played [a bunch of games](https://boardgamegeek.com/plays/bygame/user/ambierona/subtype/boardgame/start/2016-11-15/end/2016-11-20) this week at BGG.CON. Too many to list out and talk about. Some of my favorites were **Railroad Revolution**, **Paris Connection**, and **Insider**.

One of the highlights of the convention was meeting and playing games with /u/WatchItPlayed. My husband and I introduced him to Paris Connection, and he liked it! I think it's a great game because the rules are so simple, but then there's a lot of strategy in messing up other people's train routes and deciding whether it's more worth it to take more shares or to build out routes.

Questions:

1. I'm thankful for all the friends I've made through board games. It's great to have a common hobby and be able to play board games when you're with friends.

2. I feel like a lot of games are becoming like this recently. Or maybe I'm getting more used to simpler mechanics with train games. But I thought both **A Feast for Odin** and **Lisboa** were a little bloated. I still enjoyed playing them, but they weren't super awesomely great.
Found this sub-reddit after getting into board gaming again recently more by luck than judgement - I bought myself the DC Heroes CCG as I love all things DC so thought it would be a fun thing to own and the "Crisis 1" expansion adds a co-op and solo mode, so I could play it on my own.  I hadn't found a suitable home for it in my apartment when my mum came for one of her regular visits and she spotted it and, after telling her about it, asked if I fancied a game of it (which I wasn't expecting!).  We really enjoyed it so the past few weeks I've been searching for other fun tabletop games which are good for 2-player co-op (bonus if they're also good solo)... I may have become a little addicted (oops!) :) 

My gaming this past week: 

**D&D Adventure Board Game: The Temple of Elemental Evil** 2p - Mum visited again on Saturday. Over the past couple of visits we had been playing through the campaign story of this, and this week we sat down to complete the final few adventures (9 to 13), which we successfully achieved! We both really enjoyed the game and I liked that the gameplay was simple enough that, after some "quarterbacking" to start with, she was able to get an understanding of how to play and play out her own turns.  The game pieces are generally good quality (the tiles, cards and most of the minis are good, the black dragon was really great and looked huge when towering over our heroes which we loved), although a few of the basic monster minis were a bit poor quality IMO, and the story flowed well from one adventure to the next.  I would have liked a bit more depth to the way in which your characters could "grow" as you progress - the single level up and then buying "boost" type tokens that can be used once per adventure (to grant you a reroll, or to recharge a used ability, or regain 2HP) felt a little basic, but at the same time I don't think anything more complex would really fit with what they're aiming for with these games.  Very fun and a good gateway into campaign-style board gaming and tile-based dungeon crawlers, but might be a bit basic/simple for those more experienced I think. 

**Star Trek: Frontiers** 1p - I started looking for more complex games, in particular ones which are good solo for times I fancy some boardgaming outside of the every-other-Saturday visit from the mothership.  In my searches for recommended solo games, one name kept coming up - Mage Knight.  I love fantasy/dragons etc so the theme looked interesting and I was all set to buy it... and then I saw they had just released a Star Trek themed version based in the Next Gen/DS9 era (the peak of my Trek TV watching - I never watched TOS), so went for that instead. It turned up on Friday, so I read through the guide and rulebooks then played through the introductory scenario. I really like how the game plays, there's plenty to do and you find yourself looking for different ways to "level up", either by exploring, fighting Romulan ships or Romulan/Dominion starbases, going on away missions to planets etc, while the dummy player keeps the pacing of the game flowing well. The only disappointment for me so far was the player ship minis are a little small and lacking in detail (would have been nice if they had some colour). The choice of Sisko and the Defiant as the second Federation ship is a little odd to me too - I'd have probably gone with Janeway/Voyager. I know 7-of-9 is in the game as a crew member you can acquire (although she didn't come up in my game), but I don't know if any other characters from Voyager are available. I'm really looking forward to trying out some more of the scenarios and taking those menacing looking Borg cubes in the box!

**Lord of the Rings LCG** 1p - Another game I saw repeatedly mentioned as highly recommended for solo play (as well as 2-player co-op), so picked up the core game box early in the week in my excitement too.  Have played through the opening scenario a couple of times over the past week using the prebuilt decks and again using one I put together myself (which fared much better!) Intrigued to see how it fares on the second and third scenarios in the box, as well as finding out how the game progresses as you go through it (and start getting the additional content from expansions) - is it just the next bit of the story with cards for the associated scenarios, locations and enemies, or does it also give some character progression in some way (I'd imagine most likely through more cards you can choose to place into your deck, maybe even new heroes too?).

---
So that was my week. My Amazon wish-list (which will likely become my Xmas wish-list) is already packed with several other games I've seen which I'd like to add to the collection, and I'm keeping my eye out for the re-print of Robinson Crusoe when that comes out and that's another one I've seen recommended highly as a great solo/co-op game.

If anyone has any other suggestions for either solo games with good depth/complexity or co-op games which work well with 2 players and are "easy to learn, hard to master" (i.e. my mum could play without me telling her what to do, but also has enough depth/choices that I won't be bored) then please do let me know!
Played my first game of **Concordia**. Can't wait to play again.

Also introduced my 5yo to **Ticket to Ride**. We simplified the rules a bit (all cards & objectives were disclosed) but he loved it
* **Pandemic** 2p, team win. Neither of us had played in awhile, and it was our first time playing together. I had never won before (I don't think he had either) so we played with 4 epidemic cards. We did so well that after we found all the cures, we decided to try to eradicate all the diseases, and made it with 2 turns to go. Medic +Dispatcher is amazing.

* **Seasons** 2x3p, I won both. Finally got another group of people to play seasons with me and it went over well. Cool thing was how different the games were based on the cards that showed up. 3^rd in the second game was 50 points ahead of 1^st in the first game. I kinda wish I had sandbagged a bit, but its so hard to tell who's going to win that I couldn't do it easily (also I never win games in this group, so I wanted to win)
Nothing sadly. I wanted to break in **Dead Men Tell No Tales**, but family obligations got in the way. Went to see Dr. Strange instead. Hope to get DMTNT in this weekend.
* **Trickerion** (2x, 2p) - We picked up the Dahlgaard's Gifts expansion and wanted to give the two player variant a try. We only played the base game (without the Dark Alley), but really enjoyed how the Duel of Magicians performance cards add variety to linking tricks and we especially liked how the Turn Setup Cards create variety for two players eliminating some of the punishment for turn order. The expansion makes one of our favorite games even better, and we look forward to adding the Magicians Powers. 
* **San Juan** (2x, 2p) – Purchased last week during the Alea Amazon sale; it’s a game we’ve wanted to try for a long time and really enjoyed it. We’ve owned Puerto Rico for a couple of years but rarely play it. I think this will hit the table and scratch the same itch more easily.

1) Gobble gobble – I’m thankful for the quiet time of board games. I enjoy solving the puzzle of how to score the most points together with my wife.

2) Stuffed – **Dungeon Petz** I want to like this game, (worker placement, and caring for pets) but it’s just too busy with too many wonky rules. And this is coming from someone who loves Trickerion. 

I only got one game of **Scythe** 2p in this week because of traveling but it was a doozy! My opponent played super aggressive cornering me in the factory with his three mechs. I figured I had to strike first if I was going to make it not a bloodbath. I attacked one of his that had previously stolen an oil resource from me that put me on edge early in the game. I only had one combat card but luckily it was a 5. I won the combat and on the next turn he attacked me with two mechs and i didn't put up a fight to reserve power. Bjorn and Max were sent back home but I was able to immediately turn it around and attack because of my factory technology and some lucky placement of my tunnel structure and his character, Gunter, conveniently positioned on a tunnel. He was weak because of the two battles using almost all of his power and combat cards while I could still attack with full power albeit I had no cards to guarantee a victory. It was the most tense combat game I've played so far. I won pretty handedly because I maxed out my power early, won two combats, completed an objective (that necessitated having the most power and controlling the factory), built my structures, and finished early by completing my last upgrade completely surprising my opponent. I did all of this and won without deploying a single mech and only getting one enlist. It was crazy and although my opponents strategy didn't work very well it was a lot of fun to play the game in really different way.

1. I'm thankful to boardgames for giving me a hobby to share with other people. I honestly never felt as connected while playing video games and I spend too much time looking at screens for work and whatnot so it's great to have something tactile to use as entertainment.

2. Eh, I haven't found this problem yet so I guess I'm thankful for that.
I finally got my game group back together for the first time in 2 months (we almost all work in politics).

**Red7** 3p 2x: Played while waiting for other folks to show up.

**Terraforming Mars** 5p 1x: First time playing this. I struggled a little bit with teaching the rules, as I had read the manual weeks ago but never played. Once we got it down, the game flowed really well. Not sure I want to play it at 5p again, as it can get a little slow. But the game was really fun. Looking forward to playing it again with the advanced corporations and possibly the drafting variant.

**Good Cop Bad Cop** 6p 2x: Some people wanted to do something light after playing Terraforming Mars. The first game was really quick, I was the kingpin and got killed. The second game was very strange, with things happening seemingly at random. I was the agent and shot a guy who had been crooked but had evidence planted on him so he was honest. Oops. We ended up winning when the honest cops drew exactly the right equipment (reverse turn order and coffee for an extra turn) to shoot the kingpin twice.

**Mysterium** 6p 1x: It was the Portal version, which I haven't played for over a year (we burned out after playing it a ton when I first got it). We continue to be terrible at this game, and lost yet again. I think we only have one victory so far, over about 14 plays. We just aren't on the same wavelength.

**Concordia** 4p 1x: First time in a while. Had two new players, so we didn't play with the Salsa expansion (which I still haven't played with). This is one of my favorite games, but when you start the strategy to maximize your score isn't very intuitive, even though the gameplay is. Now I think I'm getting to the point where I can play the game intuitively to maximize my points. I ended up winning by a large margin with a good set of Mars and Mercury cards, having maxed out both.


Questions:

1. Gaming has been a big part of my life for the last two years. I've made new friends, grown closer with others, and scratched my collecting itch that I've always had. I love the mental exercise they give me, and playing games has made me more creative than I used to be.

2. I like heavy games, so it isn't often I think a game has too much. I think I dislike games that hew too closely to simulations, as they seem to sacrifice elegance for comprehensiveness.
I just recently started getting into board gaming with my fiancee, we love to play video games but she said she missed the touch of board games.  We started with just Settles of Catan and Castles of Burgundy 2 years ago, but have slowly been growing a collection of games.   This week we both had a lot of downtime over the weekend and decided to start playing several games that we had not had a chance to touch before.

* **Castles of the Mad King Ludwig** x1 - surprisingly straight forward, much less complex and intimidating than the box makes it appear.  Took us about 45 minutes to play, ended in a tie (technically I won by sq feet).  Creating our goofy-looking castles was really fun and we both quickly learned to synergize our rooms to maximize on points.  We both thought it was a fun game and are looking forward to another play.

* **Escape the Curse of the Temple** x3 - I got this game as a fun cooperative game that we would be able to enjoy together.  My fiancee absolutely loved it.  We tried the first game without the built-in expansions and played again with the expansions.  I can already tell we are both going to be playing this many times and I'm already eager to get some expansions for it in the future.  The game pieces are well made and my fiancee loved the green gem tokens that the game contains.

* **Seasons** x1 - This game took a little while for us to understand how to actually play but once we understood the rules, it goes by very quickly and it makes perfect sense.  The game itself took no more than 35 minutes to play, but there was probably an additional 15 minutes of figuring out how to play and another 10 to build our first decks since we were playing for the first time.  The game is absolutely stunning, with colorful engraved wooden dice, very vibrant and unique cards, and player boards.  The rule book for the game is also fantastic with explanations inside for the unique interactions that each card could have to clarify any questions that might arise during the game.

* **Patchwork** x1 - very fun game, we only played once but this is something that we can easily play when we only have ~20 minutes to play something and want to just relax.  The components for the game are all cardboard punch-outs, but they work perfectly for the game.

* **Karnivore Koala** x2 - Does not appear to be a very popular game based on ownership, but it is very thematic, fun, colorful, and simple.  The hardest part of this game was the original 5 minute investment in learning the rules and what each symbol meant.  It is a very light game and can probably be played in 10-15 minutes tops.

* **The Institute for Magical Arts** x2  We are both Harry Potter fans and that is one of the reasons we got this game in the first place.  The game does not have a ton of depth but we still enjoyed the game because of the theme itself.  The components feel somewhat lacking as they consist of wooden chips and cubes where they could have opted for some more thematic token and the artwork on the cards are very lackluster.  A game takes around 15-20 minutes.  We will play this again in the future because of its portability and theme, but it does not rank very high for me personally.  

* **Star Flux** x4 - The game is very fun to play, but would definitely be more fun with additional players.  The star theme is great and the card interactions are very well made.  Games are short and there was an urge to play again after finishing each one.  We are both looking forward to playing this again, especially if we have company over.  

* **Flash Point Fire Rescue** x2 - We both like cooperative games and decided to give this game a whirl.  I was skeptical at first about the replayability during the setup but as soon as we got into the game, it became obvious that no 2 games would be the same.  We had a blast racing to save the survivors from the burning home.  There was a constant dread on our mind throughout the game of when the house would collapse from structural decay or there being a shockwave or explosion killing the last victim we needed to save.  We only played the basic "family setup" but we are both ready to dive in again with the more experienced setup for more challenges.

* **Tsuro of the Seas** x1 - Simple enough game once you understand the dragon rules of how to adjust their positioning or rotation.  The game went by too quickly with only 2 players but is beautifully crafted and has depth of play and a ton of replay value.  We are looking forward to playing this again, but only when it is possible to play with more than 2 players.

I'm not sure how far anyone made it through reading this wall of text, but it was definitely nice to think over the games we played this weekend.  If you guys have any suggestions based on anything that we've already played please let us know.  :)
3 x plays of **Great Western Trail** .  Wow, just can't get enough of this game.  Played 2 x 3P and 1 x 2P.  Currently rated as my second 10 of BGG.  #1 game for me.  A brilliant mix of mechanics with simple, elegant gameplay and touch decision on every turn.

2 x **Fabled Fruit**: This game continues to get plays as we work our way through the deck of cards. Fun, light worker placement game that the whole family can play ( 5 ).

**Palaces of Carrara**: Played 2P with my wife.  Such a great game and I really like how chess like the brick buying is in the 2P game ( previously had only played 3P and 4P ).

**Grand Austria Hotel**:  2P game with my wife.  It had been a while but this game is likely still our most played game in the collection.  Dice drafting at it's best.  

**Thieves** a little card game my daughters bought me for Christmas last year.  Hadn't played it since just after Christmas but was a nice, light game for the family on a cold Sunday morning before breakfast.  
had a big week gaming....all games i have never played before
  
**Panic on Wall Street** - played a 6p game of this.  Was very loud and fun.  I came in last place out of the 3 investors.  
  
**Spyfall** - played 2x 10 or 12p games of this.  Tons of fun.  I wasn't the spy either time.  First one we were on a submarine, second one we were on an airplane...pretty similar but different at the same time.  
  
**Saboteur** - I didn't really enjoy this game.  I was the profiteer.  
  
**Deception** - played 2x 12p games of this.  Both times I was the investigator.  I got the winning guess in the second game though a lot of the other investigators thought i was the murderer.  
  
**Above and Below** - played a 4p game of this.  came in last but I had a blast going on all the quests.  the game isn't balanced.  anyone that is set on winning can do so by gathering resources rather than going on quests but that takes the fun out of it.  Thankfully the group I played with all equally went on quests.  
  
1. I'm in Canada,  we were thankful last month, but I like the opportunity to get together with friends while not being wasted in a bar.  
  
2. 7 Wonders with all expansions in play is a little much.
This week was amazing because one of my top tier board game friends came to visit! We went to the board games shop and they bought 2 new ones and we played them a lot.

* **Pandemic 2p x2** - we fuckin' lost
* **Kittens in a Blender 2p**
* **Jaipur 2p x3** - SO gave this to me as an early Christmas present and it's so good! I played it with them twice, and then once with my visiting friend. Such an awesome game, highly recommend it if you play a lot of 2p!
* **7 Wonders Duel 2p x2** - One of my visiting friend's acquisitions. Pretty good, distilled version of 7 Wonders which is a bit faster in terms of gameplay. I do feel like you spend more time building the card structures for each round than actually taking cards though, which is a little disappointing.
* **Lanterns: The Harvest Festival 4p** - My new game!! I read a few reviews about it last year and being into it, and then I saw it on TableTop and decided it was worth a purchase. Pretty quick and easy but it seems to have a lot of depth and opportunities for optimising play. We should have started getting dedications way earlier (as you can only get one per turn I believe?) and there's only so many turns.
* **Walk the Plank! 5p x2, 4p x2** - The second of my visiting friend's acquisitions. This is such a fun party game - I guess it's very similar to Get Bit! mechanically. We liked it so much we played it four times and it'll definitely be a game I recommend in future.
* **Ticket to Ride Europe 3p** - I got blocked by one of the other players, twice :l it was lame
* **Carcassonne 3p** - I wanted to freshen up on this as one of my friends asked me to bring it to a session this week. It's pretty chilled out but the point scoring can be difficult.
* **Love Letter 3p** - I got wrecked and it was hilarious.
* **Ticket to Ride 10th Anniversary Edition 4p** - Oh. My. God. I seriously regret not buying this when I had the chance. Absolutely beautiful board and cards and the trains, THE TRAINS. The red ones have motherfucking giraffes sticking out the top!! So cute and beautiful!!! Very sad that those trains can't be used on the other boards as they're too big but it's such a beautiful set I feel like only being able to use those trains on the USA board is worth it. I immediately looked up how much it would cost to buy now online, and it's 5x what the person who has it paid for it last year. Still tempted.
* **Machi Koro 3p** - It's a pretty chill game, makes me itch for Catan... which I should be playing this week! Woohoo!

In other news I have spent £90 on board games so far this month and I need to stop
On the topic of bloated games, the crisis heroes and events expansions for **Star Realms** are just unnecessary.
Only got to play one game this week.

**Project:ELITE** Played three times back to back. With all the content from the kickstarter there is definitely a ton of replayability available if you're willing to haul around all the extras that *might* be used in a given session. Really enjoyed it.

1) I've definitely become a bit more social in the sense that I know got to public meetups and just start talking to random strangers about gaming.

2) **Posthuman** Another kickstarter game I backed. The game doesn't really know what it wants to do. It has tons of very tiny decks and a lot of rules and I think in terms of components there is definitely a game there but I don't think the designers figured it out quite right.
**Galaxy Trucker** - This didn't go well since it has a poorly written rulebook just like all of Chvatil's games.  Many times we went back trying to find how certain things are played out and they weren't explained in the book.

**Secret Hitler**  - Only played with 5 but it was a blast.  I was on the liberal team and we got totally played by the guy who was Hitler.  We didn't have a clue and elected him Chancellor.  Was really fun.
**Arctic Scavengers** x 4. Played 3 times with my group (4 of us), won two out of the three with winning scores of 36 and 38, and a lost the third game with a score of 29. Played once with the gf 1v1, won with a score of 40 to her 38. First time playing the game, I really enjoyed it. The theme is streamlined and very straightforward, I really like the implementation of the junkyard and the skirmishes. Game is tight, fast paced, and has great interaction. Really looking forward to trying new modules. 7.5 or 8 out of 10.
**BattleCON: Devastation of Indines** - 2p

My friend recently got this fighter turned board game. We played it together for the first time. It's a simple enough premise when you're first learning the characters. We just played through the novice characters at first, before working our way up to the more complicated ones. 

It has a really good feel, very little luck. It's all about trying to figure out what your opponent is going to do and compensating for that. We played maybe 10 games or so. All of them pretty short, most under 15 minutes or so. Our wins were pretty much split even, but they all came right down to the wire. Overall, very fun. And with 30 characters, alpha and beta attack decks, and arenas there's a million different ways to play the game.
**Forbidden Desert** - Lost the first game, won the second one but pretty much because we house/fudged the rules a bit. Was just me and my wife playing and considering how much we loose at the game, we were ok with that haha.
**Quoridor** (2x 4p) Brought this into work to slowly convert my coworkers into gaming nerds. I think it's working. One dude has played before and was quite good at using walls for his own benefit as opposed to blocking others. My coworkers really like the game at 4 players. Next, I introduce Carcassonne.

**Castles of Burgundy** (4p) Been waiting to play this one. Very fun, we all wanted a 2nd play, but it was too late. Looking forward to getting into those knowledge tiles as the main part of my strategy. My wife commented on how she really liked the multiple paths to victory in this one. Also, vanilla egg nog paired very well with this game. I love the player boards, there's a little spot for everything, even your dice when used. 



**Bruges** - It's just as good as I thought it would be. I really like games where the cards have multiple uses. It gives me that sweet La Granja vibe. This is definitely a light game to teach but hard to master and the dices make for some interesting and tough decisions. I have a feeling this game is on it's way into my top 5.
I think it's so much more interesting than Castles of Burgundy which I was quite disappointed with. Maybe I should try it again soon now that I've found a Feld game I really like.
**Five Tribes** - 2x3p - Played this with my son and nephew (10 and 7, respectively). They both grasped the concept, and tried to formulate strategies quite quickly. I love that there are reference sheets for each player. I think that made it a lot easier. The kids really loved the artwork on the djinn cards, which is what made them really want to play again. They wanted to see and collect new djinns. I really loved the mechanics, and trying to see good moves, and trying to set up combos. Going last one on turn, and then bidding for first on the next turn can be very powerful.

**Formula D** - 2p, 2x3p, 4p - I played two players with the basic rules, and it felt kind of boring. The 4 player game, and one of 3 player games were played with some of the advanced rules, which made it a bit more fun. I think the low player counts hurt this game, because the track ends up feeling so empty. I'd really like to get a chance to try this at 6+ players. Even so, my son and nephew enjoyed this a lot, which is reason enough to want to bring it out again.

**Evolution: The Beginning** - 3p - Another one with my son and nephew. They really like the art, and creating their own species. I think I am going to upgrade to the base game fairly soon, as this version is very light, and does not feature much card variety.

**Carcassonne** - 3p - Nothing too exciting to say here. The kids like building the city, and they do their best to play this as a 'take that' game.
**Once Upon A Time** - played with my fiancée and friend. We hadn't touched it in about two years so the first game was a little rusty and disjointed as out final happy ending cards were very different. The second play through was fantastic and the story stayed fairly coherent as all our ending actually worked together. It was quite enjoyable. First game won by the fiancée, second by my friend.

**Lord of Xidit** - Another game we hadn't touched for about a year or so. We went monster kill crazy and the 4th player AI went nuts. In the end my fiancée knew she wasn't going to win, bumped up the AIs towers number and doomed us all to a loss at the hands of the AI.

**Lords of Waterdeep** - Hadn't played this one for about 2 years as well. We finished the day with this one since it's a light worker placement. Fiancée had never played it before and she quite liked it which was great because she's usually wary of large boarded worker placement games. She ended up winning by having the building Lord and having built about 7/10 buildings on the board.
**Race for the Galacy** 4p - Starting out with the REBEL CANTINA, peacefully colonizing five military rebel worlds and finally subjugating them all by playing the GALACTIC IMPERIUM kinda made me feel like a Machiavellian scumbag, but that is just one of those interesting stories this game weaves.

2x **7 Wonders** 4p - Still love this game, even though Race plays in a totally different league.

**Port Royale** 4p - Wonderful filler game! And sigh ... all I needed was a 2-vp card to win this game as the final active player ... and then I draw one ship after another and know I'm doomed.

**Tikal** 4p - Finally I've gotten it to the table! And it proved to be worthy of all the praise it's gotten. Yes, it is a ponderous game and it took us three hours, but noone complained about the downtime, because you're also so engaged in the moves of your opponents as everything they do also affects your next move. It's really a fine example of an easy-to-learn game with tons of depth and - in my opinion - totally undeserving of not being in the top 100 on BGG.
Questions first:  

* I'm thankful in regards to games (notice I didn't explicitly say boardgames) because as a child, we didn't have cable/satellite tv, so at all of our holiday gatherings of family, we played games. Dominos, card games of trump or setback, and Pictionary. I actually thought about getting a set of Codenames to replace Pictionary, but the gatherings aren't as big anymore... My parents are well into their 70s, and that they still play games is wonderful. More than not being at work for a bit, that's what I'm looking forward to.  

* It's not halfbaked, but **BattleCon: Devastation of Indines** is *full* beyond belief. Almost staggeringly full. I heard an oldtimer talk about the game and they said that the fan reaction after War was "we want moar!!" and DBTJr said "you want more? Fine, I'll give you more" and turned on the fire hose of sorts. I honestly wish I played more of this... Besides that, **Carcassonne** is bloated now. At best, you end up doing it as a module system where you play with the first expansion or two and pick a third to focus on for that game...  

Games this past week:  

* **Paris Connection** (2x @ 6p) - Finally really kicked into high gear this week as the Amazon sale got enough copies in town to really saturate the group. There were two copies for 5 games last Tuesday alone. I'm looking forward to taking this to Thanksgiving.  

* **Burgle Bros** (3p) - Getting the hang of it. I still like it, and I'm glad we have a copy in the group. That said, because we have a copy, and the duration it takes to get through a game, I don't feel the need to own it myself. I'd be interested to try a solo session of 4 pawns just to see how it plays out.  

* **An Infamous Traffic** (2p, 4p) - So I setup and did 2 demo games (and a third which was aborted once I realized an error I had in the rules). It's different, I think in some ways I came into it with a preconceived notion from playing Container a bunch as that was supposedly part of the initial design. I see the influence in places, but it's different, the shared alliances are more subtle. A couple of things come to mind; first, the rulebook has problems, not a lot of examples, some ambiguity (as not all of the rules are in the rulebook, but instead on the map), and a couple of typos that give you pause. I think I've just about gotten it all sorted out to the point where I could doing a lesson plan and teach it and I think I will *next* week at either our local con or at the game night before. As someone else on BGG put it; there are lots of ways to cut out someone at the knees. Revenue is super easy to get rid of, but sort of tough to acquire at times, and in some ways, it reminds me of FCM in that it's a game where you don't want to screw up. Still not sure how the prizes affect the dynamic of the game (I assumed that the first three rounds were always largely a conservation of revenue instead of using it to boost your scion, maybe not).
Didn't get a chance to post last week due to vacation, but I'm back with my **Play All The Games** update.  Since this has gone on for a good number of weeks now, I'll include a link to the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4z0ioz/what_did_you_play_this_week_aug_15_aug_21/d6rzgcs/) as well as a link to the [most recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5bmglm/what_did_you_play_this_week_oct_31_nov_6/d9pq0hb/) which will allow any curious readers to go back through each of them in reverse order.  This update includes games from the previous week also.

Game 30 - **Guillotine** - 5 players - Visited family in Houston last week and went to No Label brewery.  This game is a very enjoyable game to play while people are distracted by conversation and beer.  We played two games, and the person who had never played won the first and got second in the second. Also, if you visit the brewery and like Gose beers, their Citrus Ginger is pretty good.

Game 31 - **Dead Men Tell No Tales** - 4 players - Also played while in Houston.  The box was basically the perfect size to fit in my backpack, so it was convenient to go in the carry-on.  We played two games and were doing all right in the first, but then all hell broke loose.  An "all 3s" card, followed by an "all 4s" card, followed by an explosion card sealed our fate late in the game.  I think about 75% of the ship blew up from that awful chain.  The second game was still dicey (har har), but we managed to pull it out with a crew of Jade, Lydia Lamore, Crimson Flynn, and Whitebeard.

Game 32 - **Turbulence** - 2 players - Played this one as a little filler while watching a football game.  It's a neat little game, but nothing astounding.  We played with the 6-plane requirement card.  My wife took a few calculated risk that paid off, but I was able to bump one of her planes off the board early, setting her back and then building a push-route all the way to my landing strip.  

Game 33 - **Ophir** - 2 players - For a simple pick-up and deliver I really enjoy this game.  There is something really satisfying about building the temple.  My wife was the Priest and made full use of the favor gaining ability.  She was able to repeatedly deliver silver to the temple.  As the Advisor, I took the route of delivering gold and making a temple donation.  She ended up winning by 2 as the last thing she delivered also lined up with her being able to make a temple donation for 2 pts.

*********

As a side note - I traveled with games two weeks ago.  I don't have a nightmare story, but a precautionary one.  I put all the games in my carry-on (Burgle Bros, Love Letter, Dead Men Tell No Tales, Coup, Marrying Mr. Darcy) and my bag was flagged at security.  They said it was because of the rectangular dense boxes.  I don't have any of the cards sleeved in any of those games.  While TSA was very careful and no damage was caused during the inspection, they did need to remove all of the games from the bag and look in each box.  If you're traveling with games, be prepared to have your bag checked.  On the return trip, I was ready to put them in their own bin, but we got put in the pre-check line and didn't have to worry about it.
Small games night this weekend: 

**Power Grid**: 1x 4p, was surprised that it went for as long as it did. We had one player that was his first time, but he picked it up pretty quickly. Took around 2 and a half hours to finish.


**Deception Murder in Hongkong** 4x 4p: Wanted to try this game at it's minimum, murderer was caught all 4 times. We even increased the cards to 5 pairs. Wondering if someone else had the same experience? 


**Sheriff of Nottingham** : 3x 3p: Felt a bit too tight for 3 players, as it is always a head to head with two players.. Didn't leave room for too many interesting interactions. 
I've started a game of **Food Chain Magnate** played via email. It's been interesting so far, and we're in to Turn 4.
Good variety this week

* **Race for the Galaxy**: continues to be our go-to 2p game with the wife. Also introduced other player to the game. I think I played this 4 times during the week. 

* **Welcome to the Dungeon**: 2x, 2p each. A good microgame that I got for my birthday. 

* **Splendor**: 2x, 3p and 4p. I love the balance between strategy and tactics in this game. The components are lovely too. 

* **Dominion**: 1x, 3p, random kingdom drawn from the first 7 boxes. Nothing too interesting here, but fun game anyway. 

* **Small World**: 1x, 4p, third time playing the game. I still think that the only interesting decisions are (1) what combo to choose and (2) when to decline. 

* **Carcassonne**: 1x, 4p, with the river II and Hill and Sheep expansions. I would have included the first two expansions also but it was getting late. Good game, got two followers trapped thanks to a good play from an opponent, who deservedly won the game. 

* I also got a couple of postal **Chess** games with a friend, and played a **bridge** match online. Good games those too. 

***

I'm really thankful for meeting my wife through a board-gaming group, and for providing an activity to enjoy our time together, something that is not that easy once you have kids. 
A huge six-player game of **History of the World**. I did a bit TOO well with the Romans in epoch 3 and was stuffed the rest of the game.

Also played **Tin Goose** for the first time, and while I was slightly disappointed I would try it again.

2) A game that felt particularly over-stuffed was **A Study in Emerald**. Wallace seemed to feel obligated to put in just about every one of the current over-used gaming tropes.
Demoed some of my own games and then played in a Pitchcar tournament for my first time playing the game. Subsequently bought the game the next day and am looking for expansions. What an awesome social game. 
* **Champions of Midgard** x2

* **Captain Sonar** x2

* **Terraforming Mars** x 1

* **Mechs vs. Minions** x1

* **Imperial Assault** x1

* **City of Spies** x1

* **Dixit** x1

* **Paris Connection** x1

Regarding too much bloat, I'm going to pick two 'sacred cow' games - games that people absolutely adore:

1) **Terra Mystica** - That power rotation/conversion/circle thing seems like an artificial gamey mechanic thrown in just for the sake of it to me, along with the rewards that it gives. The reward tiles from the cult track also seem like bloat to me (as does the whole cult track, honestly) - there's nothing like waiting 20 minutes while someone looks at each and every reward tile before choosing one.

2) **Millennium Blades** - too many cards and combos. I know CCG lovers will disagree passionately with me on this one, but it feels to me like you either spend a million years learning the cards and combos, or else the game is essentially random - everyone grabs some stuff and the person who picks 'rock' while everyone else grabs 'scissors' wins.
It was my monthly board game day this past Saturday. While people were showing up, we played a few games of **Don't Mess With Cthulhu**, which is always a good time. 

We then split off into two games. The bf ran a 4 player game of **Forbidden Stars** and I ran an 8 player game of **Zombicide: Black Plague**. Normally we always do hard missions on huge maps, but that wasn't the plan for the day so I just set up a medium difficulty one that would handle the player count, which pretty much meant an easy and relatively short game for my group.

After we finished, we split into two games as **Forbidden Stars** was still going. One of my friends was interested in trying **Istanbul**, so ended up doing a 4 player game of that. The friend who wanted to try it, took awhile to get a hang of it, but then she often has trouble understanding games right away. I ended up winning since I was the one person experienced with the game, but everyone else did a respectable job and had fun. 

Everyone then took a food munching break as the **Forbidden Stars** wrapped up. Couple of people had to leave, so we moved on to two 5 player games next. I ended up showing people **Dead of Winter: The Long Night** while the bf ran **PostHuman**. Ended up doing the "survive 8 rounds" objective for DoW and we played with Raxxon and Colony Upgrades. Also played as a non-traitor game with secret objectives. Many characters died during the game and trying to keep on top of the crisis objectives was a pain. But life got a little better after we made the greenhouse and were were able to limp our way to a win. I ended up being the only person to not get their personal objective. I just needed food cards and everyone seemed to be getting them but me. :( 

Even though I was not part of it, I was happy to hear **PostHuman** went over well. People had been wanting to play it for months, but it kept not hitting the table for one reason or another. Only complaint was the lack of dice, which I'd have more dice by now if the CardHaus order they are in wasn't still being held up by the Aliens Legendary expansion & Pandemic Iberia (release delays suck). grumble. grumble.

After these two games ended, we were just left with 5, so ended up playing **Roll for the Galaxy** as the last game of the night. It was the first time playing for me and I pretty much spent half of the game completely confused as to what I was supposed to do. The player shield had a ton of information on it, but even when the game began to make sense, it all still read like gibberish to me. But despite my confusion I came in second place behind the person who owned the game. I chalk it up to generally being good at optimization puzzles and I managed to optimize the crap out of what I actually did understand about the game. I'd probably easily play RftG again sometime, though it is not likely to end up on my wish list anytime soon. 

QUESTIONS!!!

> Gobble gobble: This week it's Thanksgiving (in the U.S.), what are you thankful to board games about?

I am thankful for board games forcing me to have a social life, being something the bf and I have a shared interest in, and being a great way stay connected with friends who no longer could commit to a tabletop RPG. They've also been a great replacement for video games after my interest in those began to die out sometime around the ending to Mass Effect 3. 

> Stuffing: What games feel like they've been stuffed full of too many things, and have become too bloated or half baked?

You can probably insert most adventure style games here. There are a couple I do enjoy despite their bloat (like **Fortune & Glory**), but I really have to be in a specific mood to sit down and play them. 
* **New Bedford** - Love everything about it so far. Maybe something negative will pop up after more plays, but so far, it's all good. The AI works great, too.

* **Eight-Minute Empire: Legends** - this a great little game, and I haven't even got to try the variants yet. I think it has satisfied my need for an area control game with combat. Now I want other Ryan Laukat games...

* **T.I.M.E. Stories: The Marcy Case** - our second run, pretty sure we know how to solve it for our next run.

* **Jaipur** - taught my sister and won.

* **Cosmic Run** - played solo and lost.

* **Multiuniversum** - played solo and lost.

* **Diamant** - played in a group at my FLGS and I lost by one gem.

* **The Resistance** - played with a group of strangers. I was a spy, and had them all believing I wasn't. "There's no way you can lie that well." Well, apparently there is. I've played this before. :P

* **Survive: Escape from Atlantis** - first time playing this one, and I won. All of the other players had played it before. It was pretty fun. I thought it felt old, so wasn't surprised when I looked it up and saw it was designed in 1982. The volcano tile was the last one on the board.

* **Click Clack Lumberjack** - got this for my kid's 4th birthday, and we played it a few times. He enjoys it a lot, and it's one of the least-annoying games to play with him (as long as I get help setting it up, and he's actually trying to play properly).

1. I'm thankful that it's got me socializing more than I used to. I'd often just stay home and play guitar or drums or video games. But now I get out and meet total strangers at my FLGS.

2. Can't answer that one. I'm pretty selective about what I buy and play, so I haven't really run into this problem yet.
**Dixit** 1x 9p can be quite tricky to find the right card when this many are on the table, used the variant where you can vote for 2 cards. Limiting here wasn't the size of the table, but how everyone is seated around it. Using a small table in the middle instead of a long one works better. 
 


**Wizard** 1x 4p Was okay, I find it drags on for the type of game it is supposed to be. More than 45 minutes for a filler feels wasted. 
**Arkham Horror LCG** - DAAAMN. 7 plays this week. I never play games that many times, let alone solo. This game is so freaking good. Started the 4p campaign with one of my groups and got through the 2nd scenario. Playing 4p is very different than solo and a lot of fun, though a bit chaotic. Can't wait to keep going with this and for more scenarios down the road. I'm hooked for sure.

**1001** - A team game where you help Aladdin get gems or something. It was surprisingly fun and clever. Hope to try with the full 8 player count soon, but even trying with 4 or 6 should be fun. Maybe over the holiday.

**The Grizzled** - A couple 2p games. This game is fine at 2p but nothing special. Nothing really notable except we won 2 lost 1. Yayyy

_ _ _

1. Thankful for the friendship and communities that have developed out of this hobby.

2. Most of the FFG arkham properties. Hope they don't do that to the LCG.
**Tzolk'in**

Another nice play. There's always something I seem to overdo or overlook in this game. Really hard for me to wrap my head around the interlocking mechanics and thereby compete with good players.... But I still love it so.

**Bruxelles 1893**

I won in the same way I lost last weekend's play. Doing to the other guy what he did to me: dominate the area control/shield points on the board and ignore the Brussels board altogether. He liked the game less (because now that track to victory somehow dictates play - but I think he's maybe having a tiny bit of sour grapes, finding his previously used strategy used so effectively against himself)... But I liked it more. One of my favorite games. So glad I picked it up... This was my 6th play... I will try to get it up to ten plays soon.

**Dominion** x2

The FLGS set was a mess, but after organizing we managed two plays (randomized with most sets). I won the first game. Yay!

**For Sale**

Re-leaned and taught this game.. Nice filler. Will add it to my collection someday (obviously no rush - because the game is everywhere).

**Splendor** x2

Two quick games. Helped a friend out by introducing some of the/my basic (winning, I think?) strategies for the game. Thanks to that, she won the 2nd game we played.

**Patchwork** 

I lost because I didn't go after enough button-laden patches early. So, even though I got the 7x7 tile, I still lost because she had the most buttons/coins left over. Haven't quite figured this out... other than: "get buttons!!!" Nonetheless, nice filler as always.

**Hansa Teutonica**

Taught to two newbies (which can be a challenge, as there aren't too many games like this one). It's definitely a game where you, the teacher, can teach carefully ALL the rules but one or two are inevitably forgotten and you are left to blame). One player really didn't like it and had trouble understanding it (mixing up/jumbling the action and "liber sophiae" tracks meanings despite what I thought were clear explanations). The other player I taught seemed to like it and won handily. I will always love this game, but it rubs some people the wrong way. 

**Grand Austria Hotel**

Not good for my colorblind fiend! He kept confusing the red and brown cubes. Not cool. Reduces my rating somewhat and makes me recommit to making anything I create colorblind friendly. Still, I like this game, and as soon as I confirm that I have a 2nd edition in my hands - I will likely buy it (have been playing the FLGS copy for now). The dice rolls, in this particular game, lended themselves to a weird ending, and so the game kind of fizzled with neither of us being able to do very much. Still, I like it. 

**Pandemic Legacy** x2

Wow... Carnage! Death! Disease!!!! DEATH!!! So sad. 

Spoilers! (June):

[Wow, did we just die...](/s "Wow, did we just die and do poorly. We lost June first attempt... Controversial because we could've cured yellow super early, but my coworker refused to play along, hoping that he'd draw a yellow card or two - as opposed to getting them from me. But, of course he didn't. And, naturally, yellow then went out of control. So we lost a close-ish game. Then, the next attempt at June - and utter utter disaster. Very early in the game, our heavily bonus-ed up Medic rushed in to deal with a upcoming faded outbreak (he saw coming, thanks to his forecaster upgrade ability), got caught up in another 
unrelated, very very unlucky, faded outbreak, and got his second and third scar... and DIED!!!! OUR HEAVILY UPGRADED MEDIC, (who had the adjacent city cure ability nonetheless) Ozzy Hugginkiss... is dead!!! Not only that, but another player could have used his "one quiet night" card to prevent his getting the third scar, but forgot it was in his hand. Sigh. Very disheartening. Is the game hopeless without Medic? I know, I know, he shouldn't have been near faded figures at all - with the one scar. Lesson learned. I/we seldom play Pandemic, vanilla or legacy, without him, and when we don't - we lose. Oh well. Two loses in a row, and now the faded have taken over all of Asia with footholds in black Chennai and blue Los Angeles. Hoping another Medic is in the four loses in a row box! We were doing so well up to this point too. Sigh.")

**Ora et Labora**

Long long (4 hour?) three-player game to end Sunday night (finished at almost 2am)... Could have won had I placed the villages during settlement phases better. Had the points - just badly organized on the board. I guess I was hoping to fill in more spaces later on, but didn't get the chance. Lots of analysis paralysis that I can forgive (as there is so so so very much to do in this game). Always one of my favorites, nonetheless. Will keep it in rotation for now to get to 10 plays, at least. This was my 9th play of the game.

Edit - Fixed spoilers bit. 
Light gaming week after a long weeked of gaming. 

On monday we played our newly acquired **Mystic Vale**. We couldn't end the game on sunday. My SO really liked it, same for me. 

On thirsday we wanted to play another game of **Mystic Vale**, but it was already pretty late. We didn't get any point cards so the game lasted way too long. Was a bit unlucky and the experience wasn't that good. Probably an one-off. I understand why people think the replayability is low-ish. There aren't that many cards, but if you just rotate the game enough, the cards will keep fresh. 

Not sure if I want to play 30$ for the expansion for just a bunge of cards. Also the reviews about it weren't that great. Just a so-so expansion, expanding on the existing card pool. Dunno about it.

On saturday we played two games of **Spyfall** and again it was so-so. I don't think that we have the right group for it. The game is just not that structured so for casual gamers it's really hard to formulate questions. Perhaps next time I'll tell them to ignore the role and to just go for the location as is. Maybe that way it becomes a little bit easier. I think it's really hard to balance on the grey area of questions and answers. This has a chance of leaving my collection.

Tonight, it's **Troyes** time!!!! Oooooh, yeah.
Not too many games this week, happy I got a few in!

**Broom Service** 3p x1 - Picked up this game after a flash deal on amazon. Played it with a roommate and his girlfriend. Very fun, fast, easy to teach. We played the simple side of the board, I'm looking forward to jumping into the deeper side of the board.

**Android Netrunner Core Box** 2p 5x - Traded for this game a few months ago and finally was able to play it with my CCG obsessed friend. He purchased the game from amazon while we were playing our second game. I'm very much looking forward to the new campaign that is coming out!

I wanted to play more games this week, just hard with only 2 players to play some heavier games. Nonetheless:

**Ticket to Ride** - 2x2P. Such a fun game, easily one of my favorites and both my girlfriend and I love to travel, so it kind of reaches a soft spot in our hearts. She won the first game, and I won the second game.

**Zombie Dice** - 2x2p. Just a quick game I thought I would bring to work and we can play in the downtime. My co-worker picked it up super quickly and we had quite a bit of fun.
We held the **Asmoplay Mysterium** event.  10 people showed up.  Both ghosts got ghost masks.  The top 3 got the promo psychic tokens.  Everyone else got the promo card.
Got a few in this weekend. On Saturday we played two games of **7 Ronin**. We really like asymmetrical two player games and this one is no different. First couple of plays I felt a bit lost, just putting my pieces down and seeing what happens. It slowly begins to click though. I was the Ronin and H the Ninjas first game, we switched the roles second game. She killed off four of my Ronin before I won the first game, I somehow did not kill any of her Ronin in the second game. Small sample size, but after three games played the ninjas have not won a game. I do think it’s game that rewards lots of plays with the same players, looking forward to playing it again. Lately I’ve been more critical about flaws in games, and I do have to say that learning the game would be way easier if the symbols on the center map and player screens were also on the player maps. No reason they shouldn’t be, drives me crazy. 

Ended the night with a casual game of **Jaipur**, always a light favorite for us. H won this match.

Saturday we got a couple in as well, started with **Dimension**, the newest game to our collection. Multi-player solitaire puzzle game where you stack different colored balls into a pyramid shape while trying to fulfill six rules cards and do it under a minute. Deceptively hard. It looks like you should be able to get it perfect each time but we made mistakes constantly. The contradicting rules cards are frustrating at first but I really think that’s just part of the game. It plays so fast that there’s no reason to get mad about it. I won both games we played.

Ended with a game of **The Order of the Gilded Compass**. I mentioned where I’ve been more critical of flaws lately? Well this game has a few. The washed out colors on the specialist tiles and map tiles are terrible. There’s a map color tile that is wild in the game but we could not find any mention of it in the rules or if it really functions any differently. Also, the insert and the bags that come with the game are absurd. The insert has slots to fit some of the tiles in the game, but not nearly enough. It does come with plastic baggies, but it doesn’t come with enough baggies and you really have to cram some of the tiles in them for them to fit. Really poor planning for game with a ton of different pieces. That being said – I do really like this game. Dice placement with an Indiana Jones sorta theme. We’ve only played the two player game where there are less buildings, I think the two player game with more buildings and a dummy player will be even better. Fun, light, but with some good decisions. Scoring gets a bit fiddly when you’re deciding where to place your specialists, especially if you have some of the secret planning cards that let you play specialists on those. But I like it either way. I won our play of it. 

Questions: 

* I'm thankful it's a hobby I can share with my girlfriend.

* Kanban was kinda like this for us. Too convoluted, board way too busy for our tastes. Le Havre also kinda fits this. Way too many pieces, way too long for what you're doing. 

Pretty packed week - library at work did a Friday afternoon thing for International Game Day (since we're closed on Saturday), did some gaming on real IGD, and some at the office.

**Mechs vs. Minions** - 2x4p.  Played two games of Mechs vs Minions with the guys at work, and we won both scenarios.  As predicted, they LOVE the game, and I do too.  We're starting up the third scenario today.  I ended up being a really clutch player in the second scenario, keeping an entire wing of the play area under lock and winning the game at the end.

**Forbidden Desert** - 2x3p.  Two games of Forbidden Desert at the Library, and we lost horribly both times due to mismanagement of water.  I really do like this game, and for some reason I find it easier not to quarterback than I do with **Pandemic**.  Although considering how poorly we did...

**The Resistance** - 3x5p.  Ran into some students at the library who were super excited to play this, so we did - I was on the winning side all three games.  Really had to stop myself from giving the trick away when I (a spy) was sent on a mission that would win us the game and it got approved.  Fun, but a lot more fun with more people (and since I don't play with that many typically, it's why I got rid of it).

**Lascaux** - 1x4p.  Fun little bidding/auction/set-collection game that plays lightning quick.  I tied for victory thanks to my "big money, bigger rhinos" strategy that I executed almost by accident.

**Five Tribes** - 1x4p.  Taught this game to some people who had never heard of it, and I think they all ended up liking it, despite being terrified of it at first.  I ended up winning by some margin, and would have won by more if I hadn't completely forgotten about the second half of the Vizir scoring - I neglected to explain it, and I neglected to remember it, so we just omitted it from scoring.  Really, really like this game, even though it occasionally bogs down as I look for a move, any move, oh god, there has to be a move somewhere on this board.

**Lords of Waterdeep** - 1x2p, 1x4p.  First time playing with the **Scoundrels of Skullport** expansion, and the last time I will play without it, as it greatly improves the game for not that much more complexity.  First game was a disaster, as I just got absolutely nothing that furthered any of my goals.  Second game was much better, as I ran a tight race with the eventual winner.  I think I like this more than **Viticulture** as an intro to worker placement, but not quite as much as **Stone Age**.

* I'm thankful to board games for getting me out of my house and interacting with people before I became a creepy shut-in.

* Even though I've only played it once, I'd say **A Feast for Odin**.  It's still a very good game, but there's just so much going on that it's hard to wrap your head around.

Lots of great games this week! Hoping to get in plenty of family gaming over the holidays.

***

* **The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game**: (1x 2p) I've had this one sitting here for quite a while, and we finally got it played. It definitely feels just like the board game without the spatial aspect. It plays super quick. I'll probably bring this one with me when my fiancée and I go out of town because it'll be easy to convince her to play a quick game of it.

* **Panamax**: (1x 4p) This one hasn't hit the table in a long time, and I'm so glad I finally got it back to the table! Wow, what an excellent game. I did really terribly, but it was still a lot of fun. Trying to teach it and have any level of strategy proved to be impossible lol

* **Onitama**: (1x 2p) Quick game while we waited on others. I sneaked in for the win. Aww yeah. I'm hoping to play this one with my nephews over the holidays.

* **Paris Connection**: (3x 3p, 4p, 6p) I am blown away by how cool this one is! I grabbed it on the Amazon sale for $18. I couldn't pass it up any longer after hearing /u/HeavyCardboard go on and on about it. You get a great train game feeling in 10-30 minutes. The rules are so ridiculously simlpe, but you'll find all kinds of cool weird moves you can make pretty quickly. Everyone else loved it too. This one is going to get played a lot.

* **Blood Rage**: (1x 4p) I suck so badly at this game... No matter what strategy I try to go for, I get wiped off the board every time lol

* **Patchwork**: (1x 2p) A quick match to finish game night. I got stomped by the guy I was teaching.

* **Lewis & Clark**: (1x 2p) If I had a top game, this would be it. I had a big win due to one little tiny weird move my opponent made. He basically gave me the last mountain movement I needed to take off with a bunch of canoes and get waaaaaay past the finish line.

* **Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries**: (1x 2p) This is the only TTR map that my buddy hadn't played so we got it out. Despite me doing some horrifically mean blocks, he beat me by double my score... not impressive lol

* **Biblios**: (1x 2p) Always a lot of fun. He beat me by double my score again...

* **Mombasa**: (1x 4p) This was my first play with four players, and it was excellent as always. My fiancée was led astray by my friend... She was building stuff that helped him more than her lol. We tried to stop her, but it was too late! This game is so great. Can't wait to try Great Western Trail.

* **Jamaica**: (1x 4p) My fiancée won even though she was in distant last in the race! She had both +7 treasures and killed us. This is always a fun one. 

* **Potion Explosion**: (1x 4p) I finally lost! UGH! I thought I had it, but alas, the alcohol betrayed me at the end lol

***

* I'm thankful for a hobby that actually gets me to talk to people! I'm not a big small talker so it's wonderful to have a shared experience that gives me a diving board for talking and having fun with people.

* One game I was really looking forward to this year was **Burano**, but that game has WAY too much stuff going on for no reason. I played it once and traded it away for the infinitely better Terra Mystica. Best trade I've ever made. **Keyflower** is overstuffed in the best possible way. It seems to have every mechanism that could be in a game, but it all works flawlessly.

**Mechs and Minions** 3P 1st mission

Witnessed the awesomeness that is a 3 stack Fuel tank.  First mission was a success, will play the 2nd this upcoming weekend with the same group.

**Arkham Horror The Card Game** 3 times, 1 solo, twice with my wife

Love it.

So much flavor, story, beautiful art packed into a nice hour long per scenario package.

I've only played as Agent Roland and my wife the street urchin Wendy (per advised for first time players), but my mind is already adrift in imagining ways to improve the decks (2 x .45 Autos?  4 resource cost each with limited ammo?  dump them from the deck, it's machete time).  And holy crap Roland is not a tank!  His mind is fragile and weak!

Already have the Curse of the Rougarue (sp?) standalone but haven't played it yet.

This is tremendous and if you like deck building (which I do) then even the base 3 scenarios is a lot of content when you are having fun trying out new builds.  Hell, even if you aren't so into that, there are 5 VERY different playing characters to try.

I think Agnes the waitress seems to be the most thematically interesting and most interesting mechanically.

***

1.  I'm thankful for having larger groups together to play higher play count games.  This Thanksgiving: **The Resistance**.
* **Welcome Back to the Dungeon** - 1x 4p - Just like regular WttD, except different classes and enemies, plus there's some "variable" enemies with changing stats based on some factors. Throws a bit of unpredictability into the enemy deck.

* **Inis** - 1x 4p - Still good, but I think my rating is going to come down a point or two. 

* **A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King** - 3x 2p, 2x 4p - Fun filler that takes maybe 15 minutes or so per play.  I'm terrible at it - I lost all five games. I like that they went with cartoon art instead of grabs from the show or art similar to AGoT2e LCG. 

* **World's Fair 1893** - 2x 4p - Still glad I backed this one on KS.  It's a lot of fun, even after 7 plays.

* **Royals** - 1x 4p - Wasn't really a huge fan of this the first time I played, but picked it up anyway and am glad I did. Got my copy to the table for the first time on Friday, and everyone had a blast.  I lost horribly, but it was still quite fun. Also, the board is gorgeous. 

* **Colony** - 1x 4p - Went into this with a negative view of the game, just based on what I saw at GenCon, read in reviews, etc.  Honestly, I actually liked it quite a bit and probably will pick it up at some point.  The only thing I foresee being a problem is the same problem I had with Dominion -- each game you set out new cards in the "market" and it takes everyone several minutes to go through and figure out what is available.

* **Keyflower** - 1x 5p - I really struggle with this one at non-2p player counts.  I've come close to winning in the past (never have actually won) but this was a terrible showing by me.  

------------------------

***Gobble gobble: This week it's Thanksgiving (in the U.S.), what are you thankful to board games about?***

They've given me something resembling a social life.

***Stuffing: What games feel like they've been stuffed full of too many things, and have become too bloated or half baked?***

Two come to mind. The first was **Eclipse** with the Shadow of the Rift expansion. I just felt like it added too much stuff.  The second was the **Gloomhaven** demo I played at GenCon.  It had all these great ideas and excellent mechanics, yet when they were all put together, I got the feeling that there was just too much going on.
That looks cool! Would be great to hang up in a games room. We all signed the board when we'd finished to acknowledge the end. 

We didn't use roadblocks that much. I think the peak difficulty was somewhere in the mid year for us. 
> **Did anyone else feel that once you had all the virus upgrades, and roadblocked CodA into it's starting area that the second half of the game was a downhill battle?**  
  
Mostly.  We did get slammed with some rough draws every so often and a few of those 'search tracks' were a pain but overall the final half of the year was a coast to what the game called "Legendary"... our original plan was to *never* lose two games in a row.  We never did and it worked out well.  :)
It depended on the game.  Sometimes yes, but in others, it felt like the upgrades were offset by the damage that had been done to cities, with harder restrictions on travel, etc.
I haven't played **Pandemic Legacy** and as it stands I probably never will (due to the time/group commitment). But that framed board is a thing of beauty. Very nicely done.
I think you were damn lucky to not have an unstoppable outbreak on coda spreading it outside the starting region! (Obviously you got all roadblocks up eventually, but there was still a fair while when you couldn't have been fully protected.) And also that the story didn't penalise you for roadblocks, like it did for... a certain other perma-upgrade. We only used them situationally, didn't leave any on the board as upgrades, and ended with a victory while finding the Aug-November months pretty easy.
We lost 5 games total that were all pretty spread out honestly. I thought each game was more or less as hard as regular Pandemic, but the punishment for losing (especially over a slew of outbreaks) kept it tense all the way through. We even lost in early December only to win on late December on the last possible turn with the last action! 
My group lost three games all year.  Though it was pretty easy compared to regular Pandemic.  If we played again I'm reasonably sure we could go undefeated barring extreme bad luck.  Needing three cures, disease upgrades, starting structures, and character upgrades and relationships make the game cake if you take advantage of everything available to you.

Still a great game.
\> sells L5R

\> cancels Doomtown

\> "hey guys, here's a new card game! we'll support it, promise!"
I'm not sure if this game is going to be an amazing homage to power cards, broken cards, and create an engaging system that makes being on the receiving end of these combos as enjoyable as discovering them...or if it's going to be utter garbage, a system designed and then released under a "broken cards are fun" marketing campaign because balancing is a PITA. 

The old school CCG broken card thing went away for a reason: degenerative combos aren't *fun* after the first time you see them. For crying out loud Netrunner had to institute a restricted list because everyone got board of the same old shit.

I really hope this game works, because finding and exploiting clever combos is my favorite part of contructed card games...but there is a difference between that and *broken* combos. **Epic** gets way more shit than it deserves and it's a game that revels in Magic's "overpowered" card shenanigans....hopefully PHASE will be at least that good. 
I know a good deal of people at my FLGS who will eat this up. I'm not personally a fan of CCG/TCG/LCG games so I'm not going to make any special effort to pick it up. 

That said...I will be at my FLGS on Friday and he always gets a huge stack of these things, so I could be tempted.
I might get it when it drops to $20 like all the other Black Boxes have...
Why is it still called the "black box" if they're just telling people what's in it? Isn't that just a regular game now?
I most likely will I love CCGs, LCGs TCGs etc so this looks awesome
Is this going to be the same price as the last few blackboxes? I want to know more about the game before buying it.
Not really my type of game. I was really hoping it would be their Mystic Vale-esque RPG I've heard of. The art does look really cool, and I'm curious as to why every unit has 2 powers.

 Regardless, what is the advantage of purchasing this as a black box instead of at retail? Is it typically cheaper; are there some bonuses?
I literally sold every single piece of MtG memorabilia I own yesterday, I think I'm just a little too afraid to get into this
Could someone ELI5 AEG Blackboxes? 
After doomtown, I will never be buying another AEG product. 
Thanks for reposting.  Sorry automoderator was being weird.
In my opinion it IS mindless running and gunning. 

The fact that getting hit is mostly a plus makes people not care about their own positioning much and trying to predict where people will be next turn is a crapshoot. So what remains is a game where you don't plan ahead much and just quickly glance what the best scoring option is on your turn, which is usually where you inflict most damage, where you count first and last hits on people a bit more. But the majority scoring isn't really lopsided towards first so getting a bunch of second and third places instead of fewer first places isn't really a big deal.


As someone who really hates Ameritrash (especially Miniatures games) I'll give this one a shot but I definitely do not think this is a Euro. It's definitely Euro-esque but the strategy in this game is still mostly a crapshoot with mostly reactionary actions to score the most points. 
"Best" or "newest"?
When Euro meets thematic mechanics it seems to be a huge hit. Terraforming Mars fits this description as well.  Designers take notice!
It's for a slightly different group than regular Codenames I think. In Codenames, we'd try to find metaphors and associations between the meaning of the words, so it's great for abstract thinkers. In Pictures otoh, most of the time the clue giver would just describe which visual features the cards had in common, almost feeling like a "begins with M"-clue that's expressedly forbidden in normal Codenames. Maybe it's better for visual thinkers or people that like to keep their ideas direct and tangible. I'll stick with words.
It's fine. It's basically exactly the same as Codenames. 
I didn't play Pictures personally, but I demoed it quite a few time in a gaming pub. Now they're might be a lot of reason, but it seems groups play longer with the original than with Pictures.

Whenever I teach the original, if the group likes it they play close to one hour. Conversely, I've never seen a table playing Pictures for more than a few rounds. Of course, maybe these tables wouldn't play with the original much either.

I've also found that it's definitely harder to grasp for non-gamers. They easily get the idea of word association, but the idea of picture-word association is just one step above for some reason.

I like the unique spy cardboard cards though.
Yeah it's fine.  Initial spymaster analysis paralysis on 'howtf can i link these together' was quite evident but became easier
Thanks for commentating everybody! 

Keep an eye out for more posts like this in the future - its great to know your thoughts on these games. 
On their website? I saw that it could have been preordered from there.
Yeah check their website. I believe they only just finished shipping to KS backers within the last few weeks so I would expect copies to be available if you ask the right person.
If you reside in western Europe you can buy from Philibert;

philibertnet.com

Their customer service is fantastic. They are French based but ship in Europe and have a fairly large choice of games in English version. 
Dang, this game looks sweet and flew completely under my radar.. glad I stumbled across this question!
Rats!  http://www.philibertnet.com/en/ doesn't give the option for the minis :(



>Well I have no connection to NSKN games 

I have no trouble at all believing this.
You can only post a comment if you are a backer.
The best place to watch for these is the /r/Boardgamedeals/ subreddit
The best place to look is the BGG Hot Deals forum. You will find that to be most up to date and has lots of discussion. 
From what I've seen so far miniaturemarket is starting their Thanksgiving week sale today and I believe on Wednesday cardhaus is doing a flat 10% off, but I have not seen actual confirmation on that. 
I only played Legends of Andor out of the bunch and while I enjoy it, it feels very different than a game like Descent. Andor is a problem solving game at its core. You really have to analyze the placement and movement of the monsters and carefully plan each hero's turn to successfully complete the scenarios. It has more in common with a game like Pandemic or Forbidden Desert than Descent.

While you will fight monsters, the combat mechanics are really simple and are not the focus of the game. If you want a game about epic monster fights, Andor will not satisfy you.
**Legends of Andor** is my new favorite! 
Thank you!
Catacombs and Descent are very different games.  

Comparing them doesn't really make sense. If you want a fun dexterity game then Catacombs is bettrr. If you want a more serious dungeon crawler Descent is a better game. 
Catacombs if you are into trying a dex game, Descent if you want to play like a dnd type of game, Andor if you want a coop, as in the other games you need to have one player against the rest.

[EDIT: fixed so many typos]
Three different games with completely different mechanisms. 

I would rank them accordingly:

1. Descent

2. Legends of Andor

3. Catacombs
I almost wondered why Las Vegas was on there since it seems like it only goes up to 5 players, then I see that you mention an expansion that goes to 8 players. Cool! I didn't know there was an expansion for this game. Good info!
Awesome article!  Also I'm a simple man, I see Russian Railroads flare, I upvote Russian Railroads flare.
In a similar vein to say anything, Wit's and Wagers is another great one.
Great picks! Great article. I haven't heard of concepts. 
Another good game for a big group is **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong"**. Goes all the way to 12 players 
I would barely consider Codenames a good big group game. Once you hit 4 per team it starts to become too much and makes the game drag IMO.
Check out **Bohnanza**.  Plays up to 7 quite well.  Everyone is involved on everyone else's turns, so downtime really isn't an issue.  It is a game about growing and trading beans.  Might sound dull, but the artwork is humorous, and the trading/negotiating is a lot of fun.
Tough to say what your friend will find pretty, since art is so subjective. But maybe some of these will suffice:

- **7 Wonders**: Certainly beautiful illustrations, but I wouldn't call it cute.
- **Colt Express**: The illustrations might work with this one.
- **Camel Up**: Same with this one.
- **Celestia**: More gorgeous illustrations.
- **Ghosts Love Candy**: Might be a little simple for your group, but the illustrations are absolutely adorable.

What about **Dixit**, rather than Mysterium? Some of the cards and things people come up with get a ton of laughs. And the game is basically nothing but art.

As an alternative to CAH, what about **Joking Hazard**? It might not be beautiful, but there is art to look at, at least. And it's a little less vulgar.
It is just a silly card game but I really like **Tem-Purr-A**, all of the cards have cute pictures of cats doing silly things.
I feel that **Deception: Murder In Hong Kong** does what Mysterium does but in a faster, more interesting and more involved way. Plus it's way easier to teach. The negative is that the artwork is a lot less interesting. It's not poor, but simply functional and very to the point. Deception also plays at larger player counts.

Edit:
Games with a less heavy theme but that should fit your description are **Dixit**, an associative picture game with amazing art, **Codenames**, associative word/picture game that is played in teams and **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** a social deduction game that plays out in ten minutes flat. The latter two are weaker when it comes to their art but their mechanics shine through.
The artwork is definitely Munchkin-esque, but I've really enjoyed **Snake Oil** in larger groups. 
[Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156548/super-dungeon-explore-forgotten-king), maybe? You can play 1 v All or a full co-op mode.
**Kittens in a Blender** is one filler level game I do still really enjoy. Everyone is out to save kittens of their chosen color while turning their opponents kittens into cat smoothies. The art in this game is just adorable and it pretty inexpensive. You need the expansion to play 6, but the bonus is that it also adds a little more complexity to the game.

**Nevermore** is a very interactive drafting game with a very take that nature to it. You are trying to collect victory points while also trying to turn other players into Ravens to try and slow down their chances of winning. The art is very appealing and is one of the reasons I picked up the game. 

**Sheriff of Nottingham** says 5 on the box, but there are enough cards in the game that it can easily be played with 6 if you add another "bag" (could just be an envelope really). It's a pretty fun bluffing game that can easily get quite silly.

**Zombicide** is a long time co-op favorite of mine. It is on the pricey side though, so look up some videos for it and see if your friends have interest. Comes in a modern and fantasy setting (Black Plague). Either is fine, though Black Plague has the most polished rule set.
**Jamaica** - light game with nice cute pirate art.  
**Above and Below** - this only plays 4, but Ryan Laukat's games have really nice art.  Maybe consider splitting into 2 groups of 3 sometimes?  


**Dungeon Petz**, definitely. It's a bit complicated to start, but by turn 2 it's pretty straightforward. Has adorable art and silly mechanisms.

Edit: I remembered it being more players, but 4 isn't too bad.
**Cosmic Encounter**: A fast paced game of negotiation and bluffing with fantastic art. The best part of the game are the special player powers that are hilarious and alter the game in funny ways. For example, the Fido race  has "The power to fetch". It plays 6 with expansions. 

http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/cosmicencounter/images/a/ab/Fido_(FFG).jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091211161706

**Keyflower**: A eurogame that is a mix of bidding and worker placement. It plays well with 6 players.

**Dixit**: It's a competitive word-association game that is similar to Mysterium.

**Walk the Plank**: A silly simultaneous action game about trying to drown your opponent's pirates. Rules are simple and you can play a game in 15 minutes or less.
Six is hard simply because there aren't that many six player games out there.  Including funny, and that puts them more in the "party game" territory - which limits the idea of "beautiful."

**Codenames Pictures** might be a good option.

**Istanbul** is beautiful and a ton of fun, but it only goes up to five.  It's a fun game where you are playing as merchants traveling the markets of Istanbul trading resources and money for rubies.  First to five or six rubies wins the game.

You could try alternatives to CAH like **FunEmployed** or **Joking Hazard**.  

There are several different betrayer games that you could check out, although they generally aren't ha-ha funny and not all of them go up to six.  For example, **Dead of Winter**, **Shadows Over Camelot**, and **Battlestar Galactia**.  (BSG is the longest of the three and I ONLY suggest the game IF people in your group has watched the show as the board is rather plain.)

Drafting games can also scale well.  Based on what you have said, I'd suggest **Medieval Academy**.  It's medieval themed with nice albeit cartoony artwork on each tile.

u/r2d8 getinfo
If you're already comfortable with something like Lords of Waterdeep I'm going to suggest **Viticulture: Essential Edition**. It's not much of a step up and has a great theme (making wine). I personally think the art is well done and there's a touch of humor there. For example, there's a card called unlicensed teacher that you can play to train an additional worker at the cost of one victory point instead of paying the normal monetary cost. So that's kinda cute?

I also think **Mysterium** or **Dixit** are solid choices for great art and high player count. 
If you get the standard deck of **Exploding Kittens** you can add it to the NSFW deck and play with up to 9 people. It's an ok game, certainly not going to be the focus of the evening, but it'll hit the table more often.
Also - Captain Sonar may be a good fit.
**Colt Express**

A few others mentioned it, but I'll say it again. 

Pretty: 

 - The 3d train/scenery catches peoples attention.

 - Card art is very cool (Comic book vibe) 

Funny: 

 - Holy crap, the first time someone gets punched into the next car and then their whole turn is gone to crap...well..it sure is funny for everyone else! 

Colt express is a programmable deck builder(kinda), where players are bandits robbing a train, and trying to make out with the most loot at the end of the game. It's pure chaos at max player ct, and a lot of fun. Highly recommend. 
**Codenames** is a blast at 6 players. Probably it's best player count. 

**Keyflower** is quite fun, nice to look at, and scales really well from 2 players right up to 6 players.

Also, every game made by Stonemaier games fits this bill. **Viticulture Essential Edition** is lovely to look at, and a fun game. It goes up to 6, and still plays well at that count. **Euphoria** is a dystopian future game with great art, clever subtle humour, and plays great from 3-6 players. **Between Two Cities** is a tile drafting game where players are building two cities, one with each of their neighbours. Your score is the lowest scoring of the two, so there's an incentive to keep things balanced. **Scythe** is finally available at retail, and one of the most gorgeous games I've seen. The base game goes up to 5 players, but it's getting an expansion this month that allows up to 7 players. One of my favorite games of the year.  
I normally don't select games based on artwork/humour... but let's give this a go. 

For six players, I like...

- Bohnanza.  Plays up to 7 and is primarily a trading game. The game is structured so you basically HAVE to trade nicely if you want to do well. The artwork is cutesy and you can trade stink beans for black eyed beans. What more could you want?

- Roborally. The little robot minis are adorbs and there's bright vibrant colours all over the board, which masks the despair and danger.  Six is a fun number to play this at because you get in each other's way all the damn time.  It's a bit thinky when you're trying to program the robots, but the laughter and shrieks of horror when things inevitably go wrong is a lot of fun.

- For Sale. One of my favourite fillers, it's basically an auctioning game where you buy up properties and then sell them to get the most money. The artwork is great for the properties (they are ranked from a humble cardboard box in an alley to a gigantic space station) and it's done very quickly.

- One Night Ultimate Werewolf - I think this plays really well with 6, unlike many other hidden identity social deduction games like The Resistance or regular werewolf.  I love the artwork and it's a lot of fun once the group "gets it".

- Colt Express - looks great on the table and the semi-open nature of the programming ensures a good amount of conflict.

- Camel Up - A game with racing camels, with lovely artwork and cute camel meeples that stack on top of each other for reasons that are surprisingly game-related.  Despite appearances, this is actually more of a betting game than a racing game.

- Diamant/Incan Gold - great push your luck game that usually results in a lot of laughts. Diamant has the nicer artwork so might be the preferred version.

- Steampunk Rally - racing game, with beautiful artwork. Most actions are more or less simultaneous so there's little downtime.

- Cockroach Poker - bluffing card game. Lovely cards with drawings of various bugs on them - and each card has unique artwork which is really nice.

- Ghost Blitz - grabbiest game ever. This is a pattern-recognition/speed game where a card is flipped and you have to grab the correct object (a white ghost, a red chair, a blue book, a green bottle or a grey mouse) first.

- Pictomania - one of my favourite games, it's by Vlaada Chvatil and I describe it as being like Pictionary, if Pictionary were a good game.  The artwork and humour are really all up to the players.

- Ditto Telestrations.

Good luck :)
It's not exactly funny (actually kinda the opposite if you read the backstory in the manual), but **Rex** was made to be played 6 player and has a pretty great scifi aesthetic.

Also +1 to **Cosmic Encounter**, technically you could even rig a sixth player with like pennies and coasters (and use the special destinies as their "color"), but if aesthetics is a concern that's obviously less than ideal, plus Cosmic Incursion is worth picking for the rewards deck alone anyway. Also if you really wanna go for it I recommend grabbing like a 3x3 piece of spacey fabric from wherever to use as a playmat.
Think you should still give Happy Pigs a shot! It's relatively cheap and can have some big funny moments.
Something that fits the bill is Cosmic Encounter with any expansion that gives you a sixth player. 

Do you need the game to have humour? or could it just have great artwork. 
You can play Exploding kittens with 6 players, just put the first exploding kitten back in the deck when the first person is eliminated. 
if your friend is so picky she can only play games that are "funny" and "cute" the rest of you should play other games without her. you aren't being paid to entertain her.
For something more meaty : **Game of thrones : the board game**. 
You're eliminating probably 90℅ of the games that could work by limiting yourself to 6 player games. Two 3 player games would give you lots and lots more options.
I'd look into Spyfall if I were you :) 
Here are my recommendations:

**Cash N Guns**

This is a super fun game where you get to aim guns at each other! OMG! but there is also art that's kinda cute and pretty and it's a very simple game. 4-8 players. Might be a game you're looking for. 

**Co-mix** 

This may be an option if you're truly looking for a game strongly based on art. You build your own comic strip! The voting system is very fair in this game as well imo. The only flaw to this game that we've run into personally is that if you're not someone creative or always has writer block, it may not be as fun for most. 3-10 players,  lots of art to look at, can always create funny stories. 

**Hoax** 

This one may be an option...the edition I have is 7 players. The art isn't amazing, not too many componnts. When we played, it was funny, the only issue with this game that I had is once you figure out the "strategy" the game isn't really hard, but a rush to see who can use the tactic faster/better

**Monster My Neighbour**

This is a game similar to Ultimate Werewolf/Mafia/etc. The art isn't my favorite, but it plays much more like a card game. No moderator needed. Looks like BGG states it's for 3-8 players. Art is meh imo, but your friend may like it.

**Superfight**

3-10 players. No art. But similar to CAH. Instead of gross humor (well...), you pick which hero would win in a fight. Neo or Jesus, Chuck Norris or Godzilla, debate about it, add other cards to make them weaker or stronger, there's also expansions, like the red deck to make things raunchy! 

Hope this helps! Good luck!
Take a look at "letters from Whitechapel" its a great game.
**Epic Spell Wars** has awesome art, and can be pretty funny. It's completely luck based though, and there isn't much strategy.
Nobody mentioned Caverna!?  The first couple of games might go long, but once everyone knows the rules, it'll play at a nice pace.  Beautiful and playful artwork, yet it is a deep and challenging game.  And you get to grow a farm and decorate your cave!
I'm going to put it out there and suggest Battlestar Galactica, it's up to six players and has a traitor element to it. The vanilla game is fun and the expansions add a wealth of options.
>procedurally generated 

man that brings flashbacks
Love this idea. How do the secret identities end up feeling? Since they can be different each time you play, are players able to guess what the other players' identities might be, or does it end up feeling a bit more random when they're revealed at the end of the game?
Seems cool in theory, but I just spun up a game and the characters are pretty dumb. One of the guys has +2 for meteorology orders, +1 for meteorology orders, and +1 for no meteorology orders. So he's at a distinct disadvantage over everyone else because he can only score 3 points max from his character since 2 of those are mutually exclusive. It looks the others all have the ability to score 4 points. And one of the other characters is +3 for not having budget documents and +1 for not having budget documents, meaning he has one thing to do to get 4 extra points. Balance in a procedurally generated game is inherently harder to achieve unless you put a lot of conditions on the character generation.
Broken with both Edge and IE current.
After No Man's Sky, I am over the notion of proceedurally generated anything.
Abandon Planet from Don Eskridge looks pretty great, I hope it does well. I'm on the fence personally, I'd jump on it if it wasn't pre-holiday season and if I had a more reliable large playgroup.
Didn't realize the Dunwich Horror AHLCG expansion came with the first and last scenarios, thought it was the first two. That's a let down.
I've been delving into ttrpgs lately, due in small part to a SUASD review of Torchbearer, but both of those Netrunner and Arkham Horror press releases are going to bring me back to board games, soon enough.
I'm mildly interested in **Lisboa**, but with shipping brining the price over $100 for me, I'm just not sure it'll hit the table enough. Oh well.
Pathfinder Adventure Card game has a digital version which is exactly the same as the original game.

If you like Pathfinder ACG it is really convenient as there are a lot of shuffle in game that the app get rid of.
Shadowrun Crossfire is an ACG of sorts.  No digital version.  
Arkham Horror Adventure Card Game just released from FFG.  Again, no digital version, yet.   
Check out CardHunter.com. It's an intriguing spin on D&D with deck-building elements. 
**Mystfall** as a digital version on tabletop simulator
Were they playing a role-playing game? If so, I think you're talking about HarmonQuest. Seeso has released the first episode [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cuqqHGpRDE).
This will be the LAST time to get SPACE HULK! Until the NEXT time which will be the ONLY time to get it before it GOES away FOREVER (until the next time).

This is a super good game, if you're interested you should snag it. Not because GW keeps saying it will never come back but because it's good.
I'll get excited if they re-print deathwing or genestealer.
If anyone is looking for a copy now, Miniature Market has an open-box copy at their retail store at a discount. 
Verified there are no changes to rules/etc? 

I guess I'll finally give in and buy it lol
Wonder what it will cost here in NZ. You know, oceania tax and all... That aside, this is one game of theirs I do want. I dont see it on gw online store yet.
With respect to the amazing figures in the game, the mechanics are very dated. Rolling a critical jam can easily cost you the entire mission.
**Forbidden Island** is an excellent cooperative game with a theme that most anyone can pick up (treasure hunters on an island sinking into the sea). It's also available for very cheap - recent sales on Amazon have had it under ten dollars, and the regular MSRP is only fifteen or so. Plays up to four, comes in a cool tin.
Over 12 years old, assuming they aren't behind in their reading ability, it is as much a matter of personal preference as any adult.  If I could quote page and subsection of the DCI rulebook for Magic the Gathering at 14, I'm pretty sure 14 year olds can handle board games.

So that said, get them the hits.  The ones MOST people like.  That would be your Pandemic, Catan, Telestrations, Codenames, Klask, King of Tokyo, Pass the Pigs, Spyfall, Bohnanza, 7 Wonders, Blokus...things you can find at Target.
I would recommend light games. You never know if any of them have any sort of learning problem or disorder. My nephew is in that age range and has Aspergers. He can play all of the light games no problem, but some of the medium weight games don't hold his attention well. Sushi Go, Love Letter, Survive, Codenames, Timeline, etc. all work really well. Anything heavier than that, and I have to explain the rules several times as we play or help him. Just one thing to consider.
**No Thanks**,
 
**Diamant**, 

**Lords of Vegas**, 

**Deep Sea Adventure**, 

**A Fake Artist Goes to New York**

I'd see the challenge here being the theme, you want to avoid potential trigger games...
Saw some kids that age having a blast with the new **Mechs vs Minions** which they are probably familiar with from League of Legends, great as its cooperative. They also enjoyed **Imperial Assault** which is a little more complex and needs a consistent group but is great if they are Star Wars fans. 
The replayability of games like this comes from the fact it's hard to beat. Too easy and tips probably lose interest.

There are some annoying ways to lose, I'd say if the cards come out in a certain order you're probably going to have a very hard time winning and that can be frustrating. It is possible in any game (I think especially deckbuilders) to make no wrong decisions and still lose.

From a gameplay point of view, are you buying enough coordinate cards? The more you coordinate the better your chance of winning.

Also how many people did you play with? I only beat it at player count of 2-3. Also unless you've had a few plays and know the cards a bit you simply won't win.

The easiest way to teak is to add more drone cards or have some turns at the start before you start filling the complex. I'd say do both and try and win, then only have the prep turns and try and win. Then try it with neither. Make a sort of easy, normal and hard mode.
The game is hard and sometimes the randomness of cards can screw you over. However, an experienced group of players will do better overall. 

Coordinate cards are super important when it comes to doing well. Get as many as you can spread among everyone's decks. And unless you absolutely need whatever a coordinate card will give you on your turn, you should be using it to help someone else afford a good card, do more attack power, or trigger symbol related powers. Beyond that, it is a matter of building a good deck and that takes some practice with the game. 

I have beaten scenario 1, 2 & 3 so far (defeating 4 remains elusive). For scenarios 1 & 2, I have had 5 player games succeed without doing any "prep rounds". In that scenario 1 game we even had the Perfect Organism in the combat zone for 2 or 3 full rounds around the table before we found the airlock card (it was the second to last card in the deck). Like most very hard co-ops that depend on some kind of randomized element, part of getting good at the game is learning how to prepare for and combat against the randomness.

Anyway, if you want to try reducing the difficulty a little bit, you can do one or two prep rounds where you do not add anything to the complex. At the very least it tends to make people feel more prepared before things start to get dicey. 
I have beat all the scenarios with 2 and 3 players. The game is easiest at these numbers. It is recommended by some on here that you go so far as to skip adding aliens for a few round when playing with 4 or 5 players as the jump in difficulty is significant. Drone cards definitely make things significantly easier. We tried playing the first scenario with 2 players and 0 drones and have yet to beat it despite tweaking our character setup over and over again.

I suspect you and your team haven't played it enough to understand the skills that minimise the luck of the game. The roles you pick are a big deal too. How you handle scanning matters significantly and just knowing the scenario in general. Some scenarios you can go for Sergents early, some you can't. Sounds like you have someone that simply doesn't like co-op games. Some players just don't like to lose as a team. These are the same people that you'll hear playing for not last place a lot of times. Basically, you can't please everyone so exercise caution with tweaking the game too much to aid in the enjoyment of a single person.
I have played only at 2-3 players but have won every scenario. One of the biggest keys to winning is getting and using the coordinate cards. You can play that coordinate card off of your turn and then REDRAW a card to replace it. (Limit one coordinate per person per turn). This helps you move through your deck faster. I don't think picking one type of character is helpful but matching the symbols to set off combos is best. The quarantine specialist is helpful to kill off recruitment people near the end of the game but honestly it isn't as great as what it sounds like. The identities of the mercenary and combat person (draw a card and attack is equal to objective #) are awesome in the first scenario. Remember to add drone cards equal to the number of players per objective.
The best advice I can give is make sure all the symbols of one type go to one character. When I play we have one medic, one tactics, etc. If you set up your deck so every time you draw a purchased card it triggers you've gone a long way to beating the scenarios. We've actually trivialized some of the scenarios because one person got a draw and fight deck and every time his turn came up he'd wipe out the complex. 

The other piece of advice I have is don't treat the game like a story that can be spoiled. If you don't know what's coming you WILL lose, and then you'll play it again and you'll do better. All you're doing is setting yourself up to lose the first couple times you play. In the first scenario, for example, knowing there's about 4 face huggers in the first part of the deck means you all know "don't scan unless you or the next person has 3 fight after the scan". If you don't know the deck then you will lose to dumb luck. If you know it's there you will plan and the lucky aspect of the game is minimized by planning. 
There's a bit of a mindset shift, sure. 

In the resistance, you know what team you're in and you want that team to win.  In ONUW, your first priority is to find out what team you're on, and then to help that team to win.

In Resistance, there's really no incentive for the resistance to lie. You just straight up say you're a good guy and try to work out who the bad guys are based on the information you can get via voting patterns, mission fails etc.

In ONUW, I will usually start with some sort of lie, omission or half-truth, even if I know I started on the villagers' team. ESPECIALLY if I was a regular vanilla villager. If I don't have any special abilities, lying is the ONLY way I can reliably get information proactively, as opposed to just being quiet and listening. It's not so bad to be caught out lying in ONUW, if someone calls you out on your claim to be the seer, it's likely that they are the seer. If no one calls you out on it, you can deduce that the seer is actually in the middle, or they are worried that they have been swapped with a werewolf.

Giving a half-truth can result in good information too. Saying that you're the troublemaker and swapped player C and D when you actually swapped player A and B can tease out something interesting, for example.

The game revolves around the possibility that you have swapped teams. So, I believe you need at least one of the tile swapping roles (troublemaker, thief, drunk) in the mix for a good game, otherwise it just turns into a straightforward deduction game where everyone tells the truth and you can work out who the werewolves are (they will be the ones claiming villager. Every. Time.).
Hi I can help! 

I am in the same boat. New to boardgames been playing a lot of the party ones recently.

How many people are going to play?
Big differences between the two games:

- In Avalon, unless you play with Lancelots your loyalty can never change throughout the game, and you're simply trying to figure out how to make your team win.  In ONUW, you need to figure out your allegiance plus who to try to kill.  So, every player has some reason to lie or be careful about sharing the whole truth as you can quickly lose a game by putting out too much information.

- Avalon is firmly structured where you are proposing missions, voting, and then interpreting the results.  In ONUW, there is no structure after you go into the day phase.  So, prepare people with the fact that you need to be willing to talk or create that structure.  People need to be prepared to have conversation and try to work through it.
Teaching
I would make sure that you state that they will not grasp the game for at least 4-5 games unless if you have some quick learners.  **ONUW** was my first social deduction game, and I consider myself a quick learner and it took me at least 2-3 games to really "get it" and to under when to lie and when not to lie.

As simple as the game is, I actually don't consider it a gateway social deduction game anymore.
Not worth it by itself. Shipping is rodiculous. Definitely check it out if you are ordering other items as well though.
Not everyone is going to want to play ALL the time like you, but after the first few times, you will find those friends that are ALWAYS up for a game night. 

For my personal friends it started as a get together, we just wanted to hang out, but not go out and blow money, so I invited them all over for a game night. I provided the pizza and some drinks, but everyone is always up to bring drinks or chips on their own.

Those friends still come around once in a while, when their schedule isn't so busy. They know that coming over to my place to hang out, drink, and play is always an option. They sometimes even invite their friends and coworkers to join, and it's always a blast. I do kind of like to know how many people are coming over ahead of time, just so I can prepare properly, with the right games or drinks.

I would not recommend starting off with a movie. Watching a movie mellows everyone out and puts them in a resting state, even after the movie is over, so you'l either feel like your forcing a game on them, or everyone will be to drained to want to stimulate their mind, and might just want to chat instead. But, there is always some quick games that a lot of people are usually up to play, like Codewords, Jungle Speed, or other small quick games. But I would instead make sure that it's a game night, rather than game and movie night, so everyone knows to come over with that mindset.

Also, always keep in mind that not all games are for everyone. Some people will hate certain games that others love, and will be turned away at the mere mention of the game, just because it's not their "cup of tea", so don't be discouraged.

For everyone;s first time, make sure that you are prepared to teach. Make sure you have the rules right, and don't make the explanations over-complicating. Try and know the answers to possible questions that might be asked while teaching. Some guests are impatient, and if you don't know the answers and have to dive in the rulebook, you might turn some people away. it's not entirely your fault, like I said, some people are impatient.

I personally started my friends with easier games, like King of Tokyo, Ticket to Ride, Sushi-Go!, Dixit, Ca$h N' Guns, One Night Ultimate Warewolf, and other simpler games like those, just to show them how fun modern board games can be, and then eventually built them up to more and more complex games.

Don't put too much pressure on yourself. Most people will love it and might want to immediately want to try again sooner rather than later, and other just want to do it on occasion; you just can't satisfy everyone all of the time. As long as the majority had a great time, you can consider it a success, and if people that are skeptical see their friends enjoying themselves, they are influenced to keep giving it another shot and see that it's not really about the game itself, but about having a good time together.

I went in with this mindset when I created and started hosting a Board Game Meetup for my community, and I get regulars, and newbies that fill up the spots to my bi-weekly meetup, all the time. Just remember to enjoy yourself, and everyone will have fun with you. Good luck on your first game night!
ughhhh movies at game night. that's something that would drive me away. that's like 2 hours of game time wasted.
Honestly, the biggest factors I've found in keeping a group motivated are **Aggressive Scheduling** and **Clear Expectations**. Everyone in my main group loves to play games, but we're all adults with busy schedules so game days can never happen on the fly or with soft commitments. Someone has to step up and be a task master. In my group that's me and I make sure to have everyone committed to a day, time, and place 3-5 days ahead of time. Once I have everyone's availability, I just pick a time that works for everyone and tell them that's when its going to happen so that there's no further argument. Around that time, we also decide what we're going to play so that everyone knows exactly what to expect and there's no argument over what we're playing at the meetup itself. In the end, the further everyone can plan the game night into their schedule and the less they have to fuss over the details, the smoother everything goes, the more willing they are to keep coming back, and the more consistent the game days get.
If you want people to keep coming to your game nights then you have to put yourself in the seat of a **host** rather than a **gamer**.  As a host your job is to make sure everyone is having a good time.  If that involves you sitting there and playing **Munchkins** for the first couple of visits then so be it.  If everyone is having a good time, and is comfortable then down the road you can try to adjust the game night into what you desire, but if you lay that on too heavy to start people will not return.  I don't have nightmare situations for myself, but I get complements all the time on how people are surprised that they can play at my place and really play what they want to play.
I host a board game group that I've been running for close to 4 years now and at this point it is thriving and a highlight of my week. I've been told by several people that come that its their favorite game group they've been to, so I guess that means I'm doing something right. What we do is a weekly pot luck on Sundays from 4:30 till usually at least 10 or 11. I say pot luck but really I make a baked ziti, someone brings a salad, and then everyone else brings chips/beer/dessert/etc. Here are some things which I would say have made it successful:

1. Setup a meetup.com group. In the beginning, some of my friends came, but they weren't as enthusiastic about gaming as me. Over time, new people started to show up because of meetup, and now they're good friends and come every week. Its also just a good way to let people know if you're cancelling, and it lets you know if people are coming, etc.

2. Being a good host. I'll echo what others have said here. If you want the group to be successful, sometimes that means as host you have to take the hit. Sometimes that means letting other people sit in on the game you want to play while you play something more beginner friendly with new people, or if its all beginners, going through games that you might be bored of but are games they are excited to play. A lot of people who are just breaking in are excited about Settler of Catan or Ticket to Ride or Munchkin, while experienced gamers might roll their eyes at those games. As host you kind of have to feel it out. Also - **and this is super important but also the worst thing** - as host you are in charge of keeping things civil. That means if you notice sexist, racist, etc. language its up to *you* to make it stop. If you don't, you'll probably see a lot of people show up once and never come back. (Especially women)

3. Be consistent. I do it every week at the same time. In the beginning there were weeks that nobody showed and I just did other things instead, but once it became established that it was happening every week, I think that really made it easier for people to make it part of their routine. Some people who come are regulars. Some people only come occasionally. I think for both of those groups, they would come less often if it required more coordination to show up.

4. Find the right balance of gaming and social. The pacing of my game night tends to be social as people arrive, then lighter gaming with snacks and drinks and more chatting, possibly a medium weight game. Then dinner is a break with no gaming and just social, then a heavier game after dinner, and close out the night possibly with one or two lighter game with the people who are still there. Other gaming groups I have been to are pure gaming with no downtime or getting to know people and its just not as much fun.
We all have the same parents.
Living in a country with long winters seems to help.  Switching up games, introducing new people, and different events can also help.  A mix of indoor and outdoor activities, can help keep things feeling fresh.  
Set a time and date weeks in advance and tell people the main game that is going to be played so they can research the game or watch a video review/play-through.
And no drinks on the table. 
Our bg groups are usually couple friends of ours.  So aside of food and friends, it's the great games we play!  
I'm going to start with **Cosmic Encounter**. The point of the game is to establish colonies in other people's home systems. However the person you will be attacking is chosen at random from a deck of cards. Then it's up to you to try negotiations, call on allies, or just charge on into battle. It is by far my group's favorite game.

If you liked the Co-op aspect of betrayal I would also recommend **Pandemic** (although it's a low player count), **Shadows over Camelot**, **Eldritch Horror**, or even **Dead of Winter**.
Of the games that you listed, what do you like?  What don't you like?

Based on the limited information that you gave, I would say **Between Two Cities** which is a competitive game where you work together with each person on either side of you in order to build two cities .  I'd also think about something like **Stone Age** or **Istanbul** which are Euros where your opponents may block you from taking certain options or make options more difficult for you.

If you want something shorter, **Deep Sea Adventure** is a great option.  It's a fun push your luck game where everyone is sharing the same air to go dive and get treasure.  The greedier you are, the more likely your fellow divers will drown without bringing back any treasure.
>you really have to play around/ with your opponents to do well

That could mean a lot of things. Do you mean a game where your opponents work with you in order for you to get what you want? Or a game where you manipulate your opponents to setting yourself up?
You should definitely take a look at **Brass** (2-4 players).  The whole game revolves around predicting and fulfilling the needs of your opponents, to your benefit.  It's similar in complexity to **Terra Mystica**.

**Keyflower** (2-6 players) has a bit of that element as well, since you pay the other players to use their worker placement tiles.

Lastly, I would suggest **Dominant Species** (3-6 players), where you're *really* tied up with the other players, but that's a 4 hour game.
Idk what you mean play around with your opponents? If you're talking like Terra Mystica where you tend to just get in each other's way and engine build around each other Scythe is fantastic 

If you mean help them to help you, Cosmic Encounter is the classic example. 

Sheriff of Nottingham is a bluffing game where bribes and the occasional false promise are quite important. 
Check **Via Nebula**, it is a game where most of the actions a player takes will help their opponents.
Sounds like you need to get away from traditional Euro games for a while. Look into **Domaine**. It's best with 3 or more. 
* **Imperial (2030)**  
* **Container**  
* **King Chocolate**  
* **German Railways**  
* **Chicago Express**  
* **Paris Connection**  

**Shakespeare** - It has blind bidding as main part of the game which will give point every turn for best bidder, as well as determine number of action player has in that round. Combined with the fact that used characters in one round can't be used in next round, low scores and need to pay characters at the end of the game (while money is tight) makes choices in the game even more important. On top of that it looks great.  
**CO2** - semi cooperative game where players are against each other until the moment they need to work together so they all don't loose the game. Every player is CEO of an energy company that needs to add green plants (and stop pollution by reducing fossil fuel power plants). In order to do that you need to propose project, install project and construct power plant, while in the process other players can continue where you stopped until power plant is constructed (which means you can prepare everything for someone else even that is not your intention)  
**Guildhall** - highly interactive card game where you are trying to create sets of 5 cards of the same profession (characters in different colors). Every time you play a card, depending on the number of the same type of card on your tableau, you can use its special abilities, which can do something to opponents sets.
Now you said interact with your opponents... do you mean as cooperatively or competitively?

**Arcadia Quest** is kind of a race for objectives and also PVP at the same time. Maybe is an option? Although it might be a bit pricey.
**Chinatown**, **Bohnanza**

Both are trading focused game. Without the opponents, their is nothing to do
**Keyflower** sounds like exactly what you want.  Lots of interaction: you use your opponents' boards to acquire resources and play around them to acquire tiles.  It goes to 6 players.  And it isn't marathon-length.  It's rated in the BGG top 10 for good reason.
Xanax
Carcassonne and Resistance Avalon
I want to bring **Sushi Go** more than anything but my family really aren't games people. Every year we always play party games like **Fact-or-Crap** or **Logo** or **Apples to Apples**. I'm nervous about taking the jump from "zero" strategy to "some" strategy, especially when they aren't the gamey-crowd.

Might just fall back on **Codenames** in the end.
I have been altering and cultivating my list for the last few weeks.  Trying to bring a wide variety depending on who wants to play.  At the moment its:

**Splendor**

**Blood Rage**

**Dungeon Fighter**

**One night ultimate Werewolf/Vampire**

**The Grizzled**

**Mysterium**

**Shadows of Camelot**

**World of YoHo**

**Avalon**

I'll be taking Codenames for sure and Sheriff of Nottingham for some extra accusatory fun.
Mostly party games.  Stuff like **Secret Hitler**.
I'll be taking the same thing this year, as I did last year...

**Nothing**.

Unfortunately, me and mine are spending the "holiday" with my wife's parents. They are very much against any and all games. Whether those games are video games, or board games. It matters not to them.

I'm seriously considering faking ill in order to get out of going this year.
I've brought different games to thanksgiving over the years. The biggest hits are the party games. **Snake Oil** and **Say Anything** have been the most popular. I've also played **Forbidden Island**, **Castle Panic** & **Pairs**. This year I will definitely be playing **Codenames**.
Ask me next October.  :)  (That's when we have our Thanksgiving.)

This year I took **Codenames** because my mother-in-law really likes that.
8 players so not many games we can play. 2 of those are more social gamers so I might try to do Power Grid and have some of the couples work together. It's a hard play count. I could split into two groups but I'm the only rules explainer in the group. We might be able to do ONUW, but some people can't keep their eyes closed.
Ticket to Ride: Europe, Paris Connection, Wizard, and maybe Neue Heimat. PC is the new one of the bunch. I have a chance at winning PC, my mother is a shark at both NH and TTR.
There will only be 4 of us. I'm thinking Coloretto and Blokus. Maybe one or two others, but I'm not sure yet!
Catan and Pandemic.  It helps that I have a smaller family and even though Pandemic is designed for about 4 people, I'll encourage strategy contribution recommendations from those who aren't actively playing that particular round.
**Codenames, Hive Mind, Watch Ya Mouth** (it was a gift from my mom who doesn't really get it. Maybe also **Cosmic Encounter** and **Small World**. 
I host Thanksgiving for friends, and then have an open invite for folks to come over post-dinner to eat leftovers, desert, get drunk and play games. Probable games ...

* Spyfall. Just picked this up and haven't played yet. Figure that a half dozen or so boozy buddies will make for a fun time.

* Coup. I like Coup.

* Robo Rally usually makes an appearance

* Codenames was a hit last year, let's do it again.

Outside of those, I'd play whatever my guests are up for. Who knows, maybe I'll get some overfill folks to sit around for some heavy gaming.
I'm probably just bringing my **Pyramid Arcade** box so the bf and I can entertain ourselves since my family is really small and boring and only my aunt will ever agree to play anything.
Power Grid

Ticket to Ride ... probably Europe

I'm one of ten children in my family, and most of us still live in the same area, so we gather at my parents' house. We've all enjoyed board games a lot since that one magical Christmas when they bought us a bunch of gateway euros. :)

Here's what I'm bringing:

**Concordia** - most of the family is very familiar with Catan, this should go over pretty well

**Codenames** - Plays up to 8, and I have a huge family (7 of 9 siblings will be present)

**Condottiere** - A new favorite that a bunch of us already know and is easy to teach newcomers

**Epic Card Game** - Mostly my younger brother and me playing this one. We love it, much more fun than playing Hearthstone on our phones

**Ascension: Realms Unraveled** - Aforementioned younger brother as well as my wife love playing this one. Also have a lot of family members familiar with Dominion who got really into Ascension when I first bought it. Always a blast!

**Coup** - I've only played this with my wife and her friend so far. Curious how a game so centered on bluffing will go down with some of my other family members, it's not the kind of game we grew up playing ;)

**Splendor** - because everyone likes Splendor.

Ticket to Ride will also likely get played, and probably Carcassonne too. And I wouldn't be suprised if people asked to play Munchkin, Catan and Dominion too. All in all there should be a lot of Thanksgiving gaming :D
Codenames

Sheriff of Nottingham

Sushi Go

One Night Ultimate Werewolf
It'll be 2 groups for me.

Group 1: Me, my brother, my mom and possibly my dad.

Group 2: Me, my brother and two of our friends.

I'm taking:

Anyone/Group 1
---
* Bang! The Dice Game
* Codenames
* King of Tokyo
* Splendor
* Ticket to Ride: Europe

Group 2
---
* Arcadia Quest
* Exceed: Red Horizon
* Sentinels of the Multiverse
**Cosmic Encounter**

**Secret Hitler**

**Bang! The Dice Game + Old Saloon**

**Codenames &  Codename Pictures**

**Dragon's Gold**

**Deception Murder in Hong Kong**

**The Resistance** 
I'll be taking **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**, **Small World** and **Codenames**. All of them should be easy to introduce to non-gamers and I'm excited to actually have a big group for Werewolf. Looking forward to playing with 10 adults.
Innovation. Maybe Ruse & Bruise. Mission Red Planet would be nice. I'm not sure how many will play. 
There's a post over here talking about this very question:
https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5e5bh9/top_6_big_group_games_for_the_holidays/
Since I'm hosting I have access to every game in my closet. That said, I know at least a few games which will be must plays on Thanksgiving. **Khronos** solely because an aunt said, "Learn this and teach it to us" like 6 months ago. **Cosmic Encounter** because it's amazing, and **Codenames** because even people who hate social interaction enjoy Codenames.
We just discussed this last night, while sitting around the dinner table.  Over the past few years we started getting our Nephew (12 yrs) into gaming and so we've been seeding the family with games we like (Splendor, Pandemic) so we don't have to carry as much back and forth :)  

We'll have 9 adults and 3 or so teenagers.

That being said, here's what we decided to take:

* **Secret Hitler** - Haven't played yet
* **Captain Sonar** - Haven't played yet
* **Bang the Dice Game**
* **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**
* **Steampunk Rally** - Wife's favorite
* **Power Grid** - Family favorite - may try some expansion maps

That, of course, is more than we have time for, but we'll have a good selection and a number of options. 
Junk Art and Imhotep!
I'll be bringing my usual big box of games. Should be fun!

* Titan: The Arena
* The Grizzled
* Carcassonne
* Star Realms
* Skull
* Love Letter
* Splendor
* Pandemic
* One Night Ultimate Werewolf
* Codenames
* Resistance: Avalon
* Coup
* Guillotine
* Fluxx
* Catan
With my family it is usually Telestrations. With my wife's family? Something 2 player my son and I can play.
I almost always have Coup and Resistance in my bag because they are quick to play, easy to teach, and take up very little space.  I will be adding codenames to the bag this year.

Good list.  Also **Mice and Mystics** or **Conan**

/u/r2d8 getinfo

**The Others**

is a blast, more about killing monsters, and cleansing fires, or corruption, or even saving some innocents. Taking corruption to get stronger, all while the sin's monsters try to get and kill your team.

It's a very tactical game, extremely well balanced, and lots of dice rolling, and a lot of take that and direct confrontation. It's a 1 vs all game, plays up to 5, and plays at all player counts and scales incredibly well throughout.
Mech vs Minions is a pretty fun game. I love leveling up my abilities.

With that said, **Last Night on Earth** may be what you are looking for. It fits 2-6 and has 4 players play as the humans and the other 2 play as zombies. It has several included scenarios such as defending a mansion or escaping in a truck.
Mechs vs minions got me into board games, I'm happy I played it and discovered boardgame fun.  I recommend it
**Deep Madness** is still at least a year away from release (November 2017, if there's no delays).  

In the meantime, **Warhammer Quest Silver Tower** is fun and not hard to learn, but it only goes up to 4 players. 
**Mechs vs Minions** is fun to play!

Other games might be of your interest: **Arcadia Quest**
In terms of stuff-for-your-buck you're going to be hard pressed to beat MvM. I mean, look at [this *All The Games You Like Are Bad* video](https://youtu.be/zSsbOJ62itY) where he goes through the box to see what you get.
Do you want to play play vs an overlord of some kind of want pure coop? Versus an overlord try the new Conan game. For pure coop try zombicide Black Plague for simple fun. Descent 2E with the free road to legend app is more involved and supports 4 player coop play. I can't think of any miniature focused game that plays 6.
We are really enjoying Mansions of Madness at the moment, but to be completely honest the miniatures are not well done. Being app driven might be a turn off, so my recommendation otherwise would be Imperial Assault or Descent. IA is a reimplementation of Descent so the rules and gameplay are fairly similar so pick the one that has the better theme for you and your group.
It's not super mini based but there minis: INIS
all around a great game. Simple to learn and amazing. Get it. I'm in Canada too, I know boardgames.ca has a few copies. 
Go big with **Kingdom Death: Monster** or go home. Oh I think the kickstarter is releasing this Friday.

On a side note, why not try some CMON games like **Arcadia Quest** or **Zombicide**? Not sure if it's the adventure you want but I heard they are pretty fun.
/r/boardgamedeals
I got Codenames as a gift for someone and picked up Pandemic for me. I hope it's as fun as everyone says it is.
Why is **Pandemic: In the Lab** not on sale! Arghh. 
I owned both. Sold pathfinder. Don't do it. Just don't. You'll be terribly disappointed. Go get the Arkham LCG, it's fantastic.
I honestly found Pathfinder pretty boring.  I felt like the cards didn't combo/interact enough to be interesting and the theming didn't make up for it. 

This is coming from someone who loved the game play of crossfire and deck builders like Star Realms and is a big fantasy fan. 
First of all, Warhamer Quest ACG is way different than Pathfinder ACG.

There is a good digital version of pathfinder RotR (iOS and android) that is free to play (with ingame currency unlocks for more characters / chapters or microtransaction unlocks) that shows how the gameplay works.

Personally, Skulls and Shackles is the only one i havent played yet, but i do like the pathfinder acg system in general.

One thing to keep in mind is that the physical Pathfinder ACG has quite a long setup / teardown time, even when you have sorted all of the different decks out.
Pathfinder was a good idea that was executed poorly in my opinion. 

I played Pathfinder, and it's now in my boardgame dungeon of hated games. 

Luckily it got popular and now there are many similar games:
Mistfall (top recommendation)

LOTR LCG (They basically have a campaign mode if you get the Saga expansions not the regular expansions)

Arkham Horror The Card Game


Kickstarters that aren't out yet:

Apocrypha 

Adventuria

Legends Untold 

Shadowscape



I played Warhammer ACG and I loved it so much I bought every expansion of LOTR due to it's similarities. Not many would agree but in my eyes it was a more advanced version of Warhammer quest. The Saga expansions made it even more similar with a campaign mode.

Warhammer ACG 
If you want a game that plays like card-based D&D in terms of strong narrative campaigns with multiple paths, get the new Arkham Horror LCG.
Pathfinder has more character progression and interesting loot than Warhammer, but the gameplay is not very challenging if you are a fan of difficult games.  There's nothing even remotely as difficult as WH:ACG scenario 3, for example.

Pathfinder's interesting decisions are which locations the group should concentrate on first, which pieces of loot to keep in your deck after the scenario, and your character feats (most of which are obvious choices initially).  The gameplay itself has very little skill involved; you are exploring your current location and rolling dice.  My playgroup likes both games though.

Of the first 3 Pathfinder campaigns, I found Skull & Shackles to be by far the best.  Rise of the Runelords was too easy (even playing n+1 locations as we always do), and Wrath, although difficult in the B scenarios (demonic horde/arboreal blight), became trivial after adventures 2+ due to the ridiculous numbers characters get to put out by then.  S&S was the perfect balance.

Lotr LCG is really good if you like difficult games and deck building.  The third scenario in the base set was just ridiculous.
I have played the base game and maybe 2 or 3 adventure decks. It's alright but nothing I would purchase. If you're really into ACGs then I'm sure it's good. 

It's very "flip card, beat card" but then again I guess that is what ACGs are about.
No, it's strictly head to head.
I've been playing this with my partner using the companion app (4 characters, 2 each), and doing the Delve quest they recently added, and it's really quite difficult even on normal mode.
Can you play this 2 player with both players being on the same side?
There are just as many opinions on what's the best expansion as there are expansions. The two big box expansions give the most content, followed by the small box and finally the hero & monster packs. The lieutenant packs have the least usability for the price. The big and small box expansions come with mini campaigns and the H&M packs come with a quest or two. The FFG website has a "Quest Vault" where fans can create and post homemade quests. The Road to Legend app comes with all its own quests, some free, some paid, and a co-op play style.

I personally started out by purchasing a couple of H&M packs, next I got Lair of the Wyrm small box, and recently received Labyrinth of Ruin big box for my birthday. I have been very happy with all my purchases and have even painted the miniatures. My next painting project with be LoR miniatures.
Some other games that follow the same formula of 1 "Evil" player and many "Good" players are **Imperial Assault**, **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shadows of The Past**, **Mansions of Madness**, **Super Dungeon Explore**, and, of course, **HeroQuest**.

Imperial Assault is basically Star Wars Descent and TMNT is by the same designer, so naturally it captures that same feel. Obviously those are both great choices if you're into those particular IPs. The other games are more generic fantasy themed like Descent is and use the 1 vs All mechanic, but are unrelated to the Descent family tree. As for the Descent expansions, go slow with buying them. There's somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 or 30 of them and it's very easy to buy more than you can play.

There are also tons of other co-op only dungeon crawler-esque games like Mice and Mystics, the D&D board game trio, Swords and Sorcery, Massive Darkness, Dungeon Run, Myth, Gears of War, Legends of Andor and heaps of others if you find you prefer playing with Descent's app.

/u/r2d8 getinfo
For the co-op adventures available from FF printing, do you need any other particular expansions to play them, or just what's in the base game? 
Can you play second edition without the app? I thought it was like a mandatory thing.
I spent a year or more with this on my wishlist, and finally pulled the trigger and bought it a couple months ago - I wasn't sure if my group would really take to it. As it turns out, the problem we have now is everyone wants to play Descent, and we have to limit attendance to just 5 players for games night.

I am really glad it is part of my collection, and we are currently halfway through the base campaign, but some of the encounters seem unfairly biased in favour of the overlord. Several of the adventure we have played are time-limited, and I don't see how I (the overlord) could have lost those games without some serious incompetence on my part.

I am almost at the point of killing two birds with one stone, and just adding in an extra hero character to every adventure to even things up, of at least to the ones where it seems the heroes don't stand a chance.
Welcome to Terrinoth! I've been enjoying Descent since the 1st edition released. There's a lot to seep you busy.
This is my favorite game for right now... playing solo with the App. I play 4 heroes when I have a few hours to kill and I absolutely love it. I just got the first mini-expansion and am going through the Kindred Fire campaign for the second time, using some of the added classes from the x-pac. 

Fucking love this game
I have it as well, but I've found that been the Overlord is quite difficult, as the game seems to be a bit unbalanced towards the Heroes.
This game rules. I just picked it up about a month ago and pretty much haven't thought about any other game I own.
Star Wars Rebellion is a fantastic two player game. They say you can play 4 player, but I think it would just take away from the game play and draw out the game length.
Here are the top Star Wars games on the market:

* **Imperial Assault** - scenario or skirmished based tactical combat. Think smuggles and jedi fighting it out with stormtroopers.

* **X-Wing** - ship to ship combat, with a focus on maneuvering.

* **Armada** - fighting with larger size capital ships.

* **Rebellion** - massive recreation of the original Star Wars trilogy - empire player hunting for the rebel base, rebels trying to raise the galaxy against the empire before that happens.

* **Star Wars Risk** - not risk at all, but several simple games at once that recreate the Return of the Jedi - Luke fighting Darth, fighting on Yavin to get the shields down on the death star, fighters trying to destroy the death star, etc.

* **Star Wars Destiny** - new collectible dice game that has characters fighting against each other.

* **Star Wars: The Card Game** - Star Wars LCG.
X-Wing is great but can get expensive.  It has simple rules that are easy to learn but the combat mechanics are pretty deep making each game a unique experience.  

Imperial assault is also awesome if you like D&D like dungeon crawls.

I hear good things about [destiny](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/7/29/star-wars-destiny/) but its not out yet.
Imperial assault 
I'd recommend Star wars Risk, it has nothing to do with risk but is a fantastic game and works very well for 2 players, also 4 can play it as a team of 2 each. 

I got it as a gift, and I loved it.


What kind of boardgames have you played before? Just for context. There are a kot of star wars boardgames that have very different styles, different complexities, etc. So you can pick up something that fit your tastes
I like the star wars retheme of battle lines
I'm an avid X-Wing player so I'm going to make that suggestion. If you don't want to spend a lot, you don't have to. Just print lists from the internet, only people going to tournaments need physical copies of the cards. I even have a guy at my local store proxying entire ships, it might not be pretty but it does the job!

I have also heard that Star Wars:Rebellion is pretty great, and who doesn't love asymetric multiplayer? :)
Star Wars Rebellion is amazing, and plays great for two or more. 
**X-wing** is a lot of fun, however it can be a money pit.. So be wary.

The base set just gives you enough to play a very basic game, and I think it would get a bit dull after a few plays. However if you buy 4 additional ships minimum, it adds to the playability. Some say you should get two base sets, but that can get pricey. I only got a second base set because I found one on sale 50% off, and I couldn't pass it up.


I don't think there are any single player star wars board games.  If only playing with 2, then I'd go with Rebellion.  If more than that, then I would suggest Imperial Assault, X-Wing, or Armada.
Epic Duels is great, esp with kids... but might be tricky to track down as it's OOP.
**Codenames Pictures** or **Spyfall** or **Coup** based on your list. Does she have a boardgamegeek profile? She might have a wishlist :) You could also ask what game she doesn't have, but recommends you get for Christmas from your (insert relative here). You'll get an idea of what she likes and it's always funny to con someone into telling you what to get them.
The Dice Tower guys just did a whole series of videos about gift ideas. Check that out.

My recommendation would be **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong**.
Since you might not know all the games she has or what exact taste in board game she has I might recommend getting board game accessories instead. If I gift someone who likes wine, but have no idea what wine is good, what are the chances of me finding the right wine among hundred varieties. It is easier to just gift a bottle opener, wine cooler, nice wine glasses, etc. 

For board games there are many things as well: a dice tower, a playmat, nice set of dice, metal game coins (tokens), a card shuffler, a dice tray and so on. 
**Love Letter: Premium Edition** Allows for a high player count (up to 8, I believe), similar to the games you have listed. I haven't played the premium edition, but I have played the original many times, and it's a great light filler game.
Maybe **Cosmic Encounter** scales to a higher number of players depending on number of expansions, of which there are many! Lots of player interaction. Lots of replayability due to the variable player powers and lots of player interaction (making deals and stabbing people in the back.)
Do you know if she actually really like social deduction games in particular, or is that list so full of them just because they work well in your social group?

If she wants more social deduction games then I would recommend checking out **Coup**, **Spyfall**, **Codenames Pictures** or **Murder: Deception in Hong Kong**.

Or you could go a slightly different route with something like **Bang! The Dice Game**, **Dark Moon** or **Shadows over Camelot** for a different style of board game with a big social deduction aspect to them.
[Check this bgg thread.](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1417043/countering-2-player-red-mosque-rush)
I have never felt it to be overpowered but here are a few thoughts...

- You mention the locations / using gambling den as a jumping off point in a way that sounds like you're not randomizing setup according to the rulebook. If you've played enough games to have a set strategy you should be randomizing the board.

- Are you following all the setup for 2 player Istanbul? Placing unused merchants on several spaces, meaning you'd need to pay those.

- Coffee expansion. When you add in coffee, half the games are no longer as dependent on mosque tiles. 
If someone beelines for the red mosque tile, take advantage of the fact that they'll probably want to go to the tea house or the black market.  Either way you force them to take an inefficient turn.  Istanbul isn't *that* solitaire.
I don't, but am also interested. In the meantime, The Card Game is really cheap, like ten bucks, and it has a great solo variant included.
[I just googled this two seconds ago](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/679446/solo-variant). I like this variant, however I'm not in love with most "try to get more points than last time" variants. I'm interested to see what else you find!


I know this isn't exactly what you're talking about, but **Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** has an official solo varian that comes with the rulebook. (It has a large footprint for such a small box, but I really enjoy the game!)
I've played [this one](http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/91390/soloplay-castlesofburgundy-v1) a couple of times. It is pretty decent but can be a bit tedious to set up and get the hang of. It improves with experience but I prefer the other one which was posted. 
The one that was linked is probably my favourite. From that same thread, I also do [this] (https://boardgamegeek.com/article/7400504#7400504), playing two boards together, trying to keep them from getting in each others' way, and maximizing the score for both.

**Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game's** AI is pretty boring, actually -- it doesn't interact with you, or do much other than provide a random scoring condition each round (you lose immediately if your point total is lower than his). I just leave the AI out when I play. Though a lot simpler and less involved (and thus less fun!), the card game is worth it, for the price. It takes like a third of the time to play. There's no spatial aspect involved; it's more or less a set collecting game.
One you can get right away...lol
Well, do you want it now or a year from now? 
Por que no los dos?
Gallerist seems to me to be slightly less complicated and perhaps easier to teach. I've had good success teaching Gallerist to those that are newer to heavy games. However if you want a streamlined Vital experience check out the 2016 Vintage of **Vinhos Deluxe Edition**, both the 2016 and 2010 editions of the game are included in the box and the 2016 version is actually very easy to teach and is a great introduction to Vital's games.
**CO2** is his best, and probably also his simplest game. 

I've played every one of his games, and I saw Lisboa demoed at BGG Con (though unfortunately was not able play it), and The Gallerist is definitely the simpler of the two you mention.
It currently seems that Lisboa is Vital's most complicated game yet (especially visually). Sources: [Rhado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HauuMZsl7aI), [Paul Grogan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oObfAR8SY), [Hjelmberg](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1607010/preview-rise-beautiful-city-and-beautiful-game)
I have played lisboa a few times now on tabletopia as well as the gallerist and I actually feel the opposite of most of the people here. I enjoy my time playing lisboa much more than the gallerist and I feel that it has a much clearer path. I think the gallerist may be simpler to learn the turn structure but I found it much more challenging to know what I should do on a regular basis. The game really confused me. I found lisboa to have a much clearer picture of what the purpose of the game is and that in trying out how all the pieces come together you can do quite well. I think once you give lisboa a chance it is not that challenging, in fact I'd say it is lighter than his other games. The iconography is pretty decent and it's really quite mechanically satisfying. I found the mechanisms in the gallerist to be quite boring to be honest. I would say lisboa although people make a good point that lisboa doesn't ship until June and you could get the gallerist now. Also lisboa is much more expensive. 


TL;DR if you don't care about money or time frame I would recommend lisboa as in my opinion it is a much better game. Otherwise get the gallerist. 
engai,

You stated that you would primarily play solo or 2 players mostly.

The Gallerist has a very compelling and CHALLENGING solo game.  My wife generally has little patience with the heavy boardgames I tend to love but she really likes playing The Gallerist as she loves art and game's theme is about art.

You should check it out on Youtube. Watch it Played! has a great series of 5 videos for the Gallerist.

Here is the first of the 5-part video series:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1S4nfzxwMY

Lisboa's solo game hasn't been released yet because Vital isn't quite happy with it. He is very close and the instructinos for it should be released before the Kickstarter campaign ends. Lisboa looks difficult and busy but once you have played a few times the flow is very intuitive and easy after a few turns of playing. I am a supporter of the Kickstarter (my first pledge!)

I like that Vital is now specifically developing solo play in all of his games going forward as it can be challenging getting enough people to the table to play a certain game. Some of my family and friends only want to play Catan or Pandemic. I want to play heavier games like Panamax, Gallerist, Dominant Species, Madeira, Kanban, Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth and Vinhos (2010 version)
I played **Lisboa** this weekend at BGG.CON and I would definitely recommend **The Gallerist** instead. It is much less complicated and much more intuitive. I play a ton of heavy games and it was incredibly difficult to perform each basic action correctly without some assistance. The iconography doesn't really help either.
For the past 6 months I've really been leaning towards heavy games and **The Gallerist** was one that really attracted me.

I don't know **Lisboa**'s rules, **The Gallerist** is almost too "procedural" for my tastes. Every action (of the 8 few you have available) is followed by a series of steps... that can get in the way when you are trying to have fun.

That said, it has the best player aid I've ever seen and things at the end of my first game became a little more smooth.

Looking forward to play it again this weekend, because the design is great!
so much designer hype these days. It's from 'xxx' so must get it. And these guys keep pumping em out at a stupidly fast rate. The new Feld! the new Rosenberg! the new Pfister! the new Lacerda!

Is it me or  this designer hyping just silly. 
**Pictomania** is a good one. 
**Celestia**.

I think this game would fit all of those games as well, and doesn't break the bank either.
For people who really aren't into board games, the **Timeline** and **Cardline** series of games are really simple trivia games.
**Telestrations**

**Cash n' Guns**
**Concept**

**Wits and Wagers**

**Guillotine**
**Pictomania** and **Diamant** (the last one is dirt-simple and can be played by 5/6-year olds).
Biblios, Hey, Thats My Fish!, Camel Up, Pandemic: The Cure, Splendor, King of Tokyo, Garbage Day, Forbidden Desert off the top of my head. 
3 player is significantly less fun; consider having more children.
BGG has the age at 12+ the BGG community has it at 10+.

This makes sense to me. Some of the roles can get quite complex I'm sure if you have a bright kid and you manage which roles are available you could walk a younger kid through a game.

I have 2 at 5 and 7, both very smart, highly sociable kids who like games.  Cosmic Encounter is one of my favorites, and I can't wait to play with them.  But as it stands:

- Too much reading.  The game would take hours.

- Too much nuance.  They'd get stomped on accident, forgetting they have a certain card in their hand.

- Too much deception.  They can bluff and whatnot *some*, but they are so poor at lying and bravado, that part of the game is gone.

- Too much interaction.  You'd be coaching every minute of the game.

I'd say the minimum age would average out at about 10.5 to make it a fair fight; though every kid is different.  Some will be barely ready at 9, others will be barely ready at 12.  If you're looking for a similar experience, I'd suggest:

**My First Bohnanza**.  This has all the deal-making, all the time.  The original game is the same as this one, but the numbers/values are larger and the theme's a little different.  This is by no means a "kid version", it's the same game, but has player mats.  I hate kid versions and I have this game.

**Catan**.  Like, regular Catan.  They can handle it.

**King of Tokyo**/**Arena of the Planeswalkers**.  These will be good if what they want is multiplayer combat, which is the one thing the two above can't provide.
I started playing CE at 7, and this was pretty much my first 'real' board game. This was with the EON edition back in 1978, so it was a lot less complex than it is now; no flares, only 12 alien powers, etc.

I think you could do it by borrowing concepts from that original edition.  

* Remove the flares, just don't play with them at all.
* Go through the aliens and keep only simple ones, not necessarily by colour, but by their interaction. I would suggest looking at the original list from the 1978 Eon game, they worked great and most of them are still in the FFG version.
* Remove the Wild and Special cards from the Destiny deck.
* Remove the Reinforcement cards from the Encounter deck.

Play this way, start of slow without too strict adherence to the turn order, and then expand the number of aliens in the game (you get free mini-expansions each time you do this!!), add new features (now we have re-inforcements, etc), and move on from there.

I am sure you can find the original Eon rules online somewhere, which were much simpler, and get an idea of what the game was like back then when it played great 2-4 player, and was great for me and my friends at 7.
I've played Cosmic Encounter with a 10-year-old who also made it all the way through a Descent campaign. He was able to understand the rules of Cosmic Encounter just fine but the strategy was hard for him to grasp. He wasn't sure when to team up and with whom. He basically handed his mom the game because he did whatever she told him to and wouldn't listen to anyone else's advice. 
In my experience, 4- and 5-year-olds are right at the edge of learning bluffing and negotiations (in games).

They're right on the edge of being able to put themselves in someone else's shoes and see things from the other side's point of view.

**Cosmic Encounter** might be a but much, but **Bohnanza** (for negotiating) or **Cockroach Poker** (for bluffing) might work. They're going to be bad at it, but if they understand that it's OK (during game time) to play with the parents as equals and negotiate and bluff and whatnot, I think it's okay.

When I played two-player **Cranium** with my daughter when she was five, she happily reported that she "totally won" when her mom got home. (She was able to guess all my drawings, I couldn't guess any of hers. Same with the signing and the charade.) It didn't make much sense - but it was a really funny afternoon.

The worst thing to do would be to accelerate the learning curve of gaming to the point where it's not fun for your wife or child. I'm guessing you're like me and you'll be excited to learn and playing anything, not matter how complex, but they may not be as excited (or ready).

Anyway, I wish you the best of luck. 
**Race for the Galaxy**
**Chicago Express** should definitely be considered.
''Hansa Teutonica'' - Once everyone knows the rules, games with 3-5 take about an hour, and can finish even before that. High on player interaction, each turn comes around pretty fast
So, for me "filler" and "challenging" doesn't mix.  

In general, for a challenging but relatively short game, I would say **Glass Road.**  It's a nice, short euro that's relatively heavy for the length.

**Kingdom Builder** is another option - lighter but plays quickly (mostly due to the fact that a lot of the decisions in the game are made by what cards you draw.)

**Harbour** is a tiny smallbox worker placement/resource management game that you can play in an hour.  I highly suggest it.

**Between Two Cities** is another excellent suggestion - every group needs a copy.  It plays from 2-7 (two player is unofficial, but you can probably guess the rules by reading the book.)  It's a drafting game so it scales well and you make interesting decisions throughout.  It's surprisingly deep if you're a min-maxer and setup/teaching time is relatively short.  It's also great when you have varied skill levels / deals a little bit with the issue of quarterbacking.

**Splendor** of course.  It may be too light for you?  I'm not a huge fan of Splendor, but it's not a bad game to pull out in these situations.

**Medieval Academy** is a drafting game that's relatively light but allows you to make interesting decisions throughout.

**Imhotep** is another game that I think works well for the time you expressed.  I haven't actually played it but the friend who taught me my first board games uses Imhotep for this exact situation.  So I can't say as much about how it plays, but he has excellent taste and it's an award winning game.

**Medici** - This is a bidding game with surprising depth.

u/r2d8 getinfo
In addition to **Isle of Skye** and **Chicago Express**, I'd suggest **Peleponnes**. All exceptionally deep for their play length, especially the latter two.
I guess "heavier" is subjective. :)  Based on your calibration maybe some of these would work.

**Glass Road**, **Isle of Skye** and **Carcassonne** all come in at less than one hour. Glass Road definitely has a heavier Euro feel to it.

I recently picked up **Coal Baron: The Big Card Game** and was quite impressed with how much it squeezes into a small box and small time slot.
Look at Carl Chudyk's games.
**Paris Connection** (also known as **SNCF**) falls into the "Thinky Filler" category.  Setup time is a little on the long side, but the gameplay is quick and easy with plenty to think about.  
**Isle of Skye**. It provides more interesting decisions in 45 minutes than many games in two hours, particularly in how to price the tiles you draw.
My vote goes to : **The Palaces of Carrara**. Its mid euro that can be played under an hour. You don't need English version (as it is out of print Im sure) as game is language independent except for final goal cards which stand on the tbl to mark when games could end (and for that there is translation on bgg, even though they have icons as well) .
I can think of arboretum, and the games from the tiny epic series.
~~**13 Days**~~ sorry glanced passed the player count requirement.

**Tiny Epic Galaxy/Western**

**Vikings**

**Roll for the Galaxy**
Recently just got **Castles of Burgundy** which my wife and I have been enjoying.  Lots of decision making involved, and plays in under 1 hour.
**Innovation** may fit the bill. High in player interaction and can be as short as 20 mins (our shortest game, all the stars aligned for my friend) or as long as an hour and a half.
Inis?
**Ra** Awesome auction and set building game. Great element of push your luck.

**Neuroshima Hex** Quick battle game where losing your units is expected. Try the app to see if you like it.

**Quadropolis** Tableau/City building game. Plays quick interesting tile selection.

**Arcane Academy** Tableau building to build powers. Play item and spell cards for points and effects. 

**Mystic Vale** interesting card crafting mechanic.

**Condotierre** Area control game with simple mechanics. Check out SUSD review. Kind of hard to find.

Awesome responses, all.. virtually none of those were on my radar so I've got LOTS of research to do.

Yes - heavy/deep is VERY subjective.  So many of the "filler" games are party games.. and I like those too.. but I'm trying to find something that is like the experience when I play Caverna, or Eclipse, or Scythe (etc) but in a more bite sized package.  I suppose the big challenge is that it makes no sense to spend an hour on the rules to play for 30.. but hey, practice makes perfect..

Out of the stuff listed, I've got (and like) Roll for the Galaxy and Splendor (a little light but I like it).  I've got a 75 or so game collection - and there are multiple people in my game group that have many more than me.. so it's funny so many of these are new to me.

Awesome advice, all.. cheers!
It wasn't **Relic**? 


I got the chance to play this over the weekend. It's a really solid game, and like you would expect from a big box Cathala game, takes quite a bit of thought to pull off a good turn. 

Shared route building using colored boats to surround islands is the games core concept. The other is a player role draft at the beginning of each turn (role gives you some boats, a unique ability, and also sets turn order). 

Only major limitation on your turn is that you have to expand the boat network by building off an existing boat of matching color. If you end turn with boats surrounding an empty island, and the colors match the colors of a building available via a tile market, build it and get big VP! There's a few other little things going on but that is the gist. 

We had a really good time with it. Played in an hour flat. From talking with Bruno, games often end with one player building all of their buildings. But we were pretty cutthroat and blocked each other a bit, forcing the network of boats to keep expanding. Eventually this triggered an endgame where we ran out of one color of boats. 
Not always a fan of DoW, but always a fan of Bruno Cathala.  Looking forward to giving this one a go.

The board looks a bit ugly in my opinion. Looks like it was made in Word. But all the other art is nice like five tribes. 
I do love the production quality of days of wonder games
I WANT IT
As someone who plays Five Tribes almost religiously this is very exciting.
Any release date in all that info?
I'm intrigued, I also think the board looks rather dull. I guess I'd prefer that over busy and garish, but still, the theme doesn't quite come through in the art. Then again, this might be a prototype...
Did a double take to check if it's a hentai game :D
I've always thought that **Galaxy Defenders** was basically an X-Com game. It's a miniatures co-op game with a good campaign. There's also a Starship Trooper feel to the game and my sons and I have greatly enjoyed the base game and it's expansions.
I'm sure someone asked something like this before and I believe **Level 7 [Omega Protocol]** was one of the answers that cropped up.

/u/r2d8 getinfo
I would say **Star Wars X-Wing** feels similar to the video game.
Ignoring the geoscape aspect of xcom, **Earth reborn** really emulates the tactical combat.
Honestly, Galaxy Defenders really was what XCom should have been. Try that out.
This may be looked down upon but **Blood Bowl**.

This is a cool squad/team based tactical board game in turns and dice. Yes it is a bit goofy and it isn't really serious but it could totally scratch that itch. 
Level 7 Omega Protocol and Earth Reborn are the closest, both offer excellent tactical battles.

Another one is Night of Man, which is a little different, being a wargame with a sci-fi skin.
Not a war game, but Eric Lang's "The Others" is great fun and feels to me like X-Com's missions. There's no Campaign or tech advancement, but the back and forth is really good. 

The game is a team that can deploy 3 or 4 unique units out of 7 at a time and are facing off against a set of objectives and a bunch of monstrous corrupted humans and monstrous "others". 

It's got push your luck mechanics, asymmetrical dice with exploding (roll another) critical results. To date almost every game has been a rollercoaster of alternating which side is looking to win all the way to the end.
This is probably the closest thing

https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/susd-play-infinity/
Though not space/scifi themed, **Kingdom Death: Monster** is very much an X-COM type game.  It also has a hefty price tag if you can even find it. A new Kickstarter begins on Black Friday and might be the only chance to get the game at a reasonable price.

It has a group of Survivors, your soldiers; Lantern Year encounters, missions; A set of monsters to fight, the different Alien types; Settlement Phase, where you research new items and build new armor/weapons from what you got from the mission. And your Survivors will die horribly just like they do in X-COM!

People balk at the high price, but there is a serious amount of content in the game and there is high replayability.
MoM's Insanity conditions are an interesting take on the (potential) traitor mechanic in many co-op games. It is usually implemented to give a player more  autonomy wih respect to more dominant player's instructions. It can be a nice change of pace to just do your own thing while fully ignoring what your fellow players say.

That said, it's a matter of personal taste wether you find the specific insanity conditions fun. If you don't, check out some player made alternatives over at Board Game Geek. http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205059/mansions-madness-second-edition/forums/69
The idea is that your break in sanity creates a different motivation for you. You no longer care about the investigation but whatever your focus is now
I'm not in love with them. The pyro one's come up three times for us, and twice it just instantly ended the game, while the third time it was so late in the game that the player had effectively no chance of ever winning (and it was also 100% due to unavoidable horror in the 4th scenario, so it felt like a particularly cheap shot).
When I play 2 player with my GF, we typically ignore Insanity effects. 
Did you confirm that both of your insanities were supposed to be in the deck at 2 players?   I think there's a thingy on the bottom right that tells you what player counts the insanity applies to.

I suspect that low player counts remove some of the "traitor" style ones in favor of the "weird side quest" style, but I've been trying to preserve the surprise and avoided looking at all the backs.
Phil Eklund's games are a mix between the two. 
**Leaving Earth**

/u/r2d8 getinfo

**Evolution Climate** seems to fit. On the plus side it is an awesome game.
**RoboRally** teaches the fundamental of programming.  **Robot Turtles** is RoboRally for younger kids.
The **COIN** games from GMT are excellent models of asymmetric historical conflicts, specifically insurgencies. My favorite is Falling Sky, set in ancient Gaul, but most of the series is set after 1900. All of them do an excellent job of capturing the different feel of four factions with different identities and goals, and the card decks provide a huge selection of real historical events to play through, with a paragraph or more of explanatory flavor text for each one in the Playbook.
If you like the space theme, Leaving Earth is my current fave. Less intense than an Eklund while capturing the feel of the space race. Probably my favorite solo play experience right now.
The Timeline Series.

Probably more game than sim, but it has more sim than most board games I've played-

Archipelago. Supply & demand on local and foreign markets affects unemployment and civil unrest. The game achieves a pretty neat balance here. And pretty much every player action has a direct or indirect effect on these systems (despite these systems often not being the focus of what the player is trying to do!!). Very cool stuff
It's definitely more game than simulation, but I've always thought that **Power Grid** does a neat job of simulating supply and demand.
**Campaign for North Africa** is a real time war simulation boardgame
Two heavier games that aren't really 'educational' but that do provide a good opportunity for educational discussion - **Through the Ages** and **Terraforming Mars**. Both have a plethora of historically (TTA) or scientifically (TM) accurate cards representing technologies, discoveries, historical figures, scientific processes, etc. Neither one gives you much information about them, but they're well integrated thematically into the game and could provide excellent talking points.
Don't worry, play what you have to the point where the text on the cards aren't legible anymore and the board has split into three pieces.

You'll have had your fill of those games by then. Boardgames are a luxury and the 5x5 Kallaxes you see on the [COMC] posts are not normal, they are our hobby's whales who have reached the point in life where they can afford it.

Here in the UK, it's similar. Big box games that used to around the £70 rrp now have an RRP of £93, more than a weeks shopping for my family. They have truly entered the luxury end of the market.

I could end it there *but* I have around 40 games that I can play so I don't have **A Feast for Odin** but I do have **Tzolk'in** so I play that instead. I'd love **El Grande** but I don't have that so I play the lesser known game **Han** instead.

I can't comment on your financial situation but board games should be last in your budget, particularly if you are struggling
I really hope that you get some diverse responses. I'm not certain if this sub will have the best answers since I know that the sub can skew towards certain countries (although I'm certain that Australians can commiserate on cost issues.)

I wouldn't say just give up on the hobby if you enjoy it. There's a few things you should do... 

- Look into meetups. I honestly have no idea what the scene is like in your country for board games. You might be able to find a small group of people so that you can combine collections while playing together or make joint investments (for example, buying pandemic legacy together splitting the cost.) You may find other people who are overjoyed to play the games in your collection and who have games that you've dreamed of playing.

- Print and play games. I'm on mobile so linking to a list will be hard. There are tons of games that can be PNP - Secret Hitler, Heat, etc. You could also try checking with some of the major game companies whether they have games needing playtesters. Note that sometimes PNP games can cost as much or more to make the game than buying a new game but if you get some generic cubes, dice, etc then you can often reuse items between various games. I have had friends who made their own copies of Medici and Spyfall as well.
Just because you can't get new board games doesn't mean you should quit. There's a lot of satisfaction to be found by mastering a game. Just make sure you mix it up as much as you can. On top of that, you're not the only one who owns board games. Find more people to play board games with and I can guarantee you you'll also find more board games!

Also, if there's a game you feel you absolutely need to have, you can ask everyone in the group to pitch in to buy it. The only issue is figuring out who gets to keep the game.

Best of luck.
You can play online in boiteajeux.com, yucata.de and boardgame arena. In addition, tabletopia will be released soon.
Try **Tabletop Simulator** - I'm not sure if you can do pass and play on it but they have layouts for Betrayal at House on the Hill, Catan etc etc. Think about grabbing it in the Steam Christmas sale.
Echoing a couple of the comments but just remember... the true competition aspect of boardgaming is *supposed* to be the play of the game itself... NOT keeping up with the size of everyone else's collection. I guess it is like that with most things which involve a "collection" aspect but you're always going to see people posting pictures of their giant collections and talking about owing every new and cool game. Everyone is different and the main thing is that whatever you do... gaming, cars, cigars, porcelain dolls or whatever...  do it within your means. Budget and allocate a comfortable dollar amount to your hobbies, find groups where you aren't pressured to be the sole source of new games, play what you own and get your value out of it. Look for quality in the face of a hobby gone mad with quantity. 
Board games to go facebook group. Lots of people selling 2nd hand games on the cheap. Sell off your old games to afford new ones.

Board game cafes. All Aboard Community Gaming Center and Meeples Cafe. Get your board gaming fix without having to buy a whole game.

Arrange meetups with people (like me!) so you can play other games without committing to financial investment.

Good luck! The ringgit sucks (THANKS NAJIB YOU FUCKER) but it's possible.
There are a few lists that list this same one, I definitely saw a better one than the one I'm about to show you, but there are actually a bunch of games that can be used to also play other games.  So if you ignore the artwork you kind of are getting a 2 for 1 deal, and at times even [more](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/24313/games-playable-deck-6-nimmtor-category-5-please-ad).

[But check out this list of games that also can be played as other games](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/20503/many-games-price-one-definitive-games-can-be-playe), and be sure to look and dig deeper into BGG to find other lists like this one.
Wow thanks people. It's a start. Board games are becoming a luxury. I used to be the one owning the board games but sold them off now no one is buying. 

But great suggestions. I mean even if it is catan it's still fun if played once in awhile. 

I was thinking of organizing a group to just share games around and meet up to play. Problem is have to manage carefully cause there are casual, medium and hardcore gamers. 

I also got onto lotr lcg to play solo. Got it cheap off the market. Lucky me.
Have you explored RPG games like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or Fate.  Once you have your core set of rule books you can expand indefinitely limited only by your imagination.  Pathfinder and Fate are really reasonable for the digital editions.  Also there are several podcasts of people playing these games that you can use for inspiration for your own games. 
Well, I would say, play what you have as much as you can.
Then, safe just a bit of money every month. And then once every 6 to 12 months, but yourself one.
It is all about life admin, mate, there is no other option but to keep that hunger for more as far away as possible.
Same things started happening to me (and games are relatively cheap here), I had to cut back on getting new games and am very selective about what I get now.
> If you guys know of any cheaper way to get games to where I am in Malaysia without shipping cost killing me

Paging /u/sigma83
* Play what you got. There's no need to be perpetually buying games. Only buy something when it fits into your budget, and you want it, and you need a break from what you have.
* Look around for gaming groups. If you can show up for a gaming group with a collection, there's no reason for you to ever buy a game!
* Online. Board Game Arena is a nicely designed site for online play and they have a nice selection of games -- all free (though you can pay for a membership)
What exactly do you want to quit? Keep playing the games you own. It won't cost you a penny to continue in this hobby.

And even if you were not having financial difficulties I would argue this is the cheapest hobby to have because its so easy to be a freeloader. What this hobby is missing is not games but players. Show up at any local game club and you will see gamers will stacks of unplayed games. They just want to get them played.

So either keep playing your games, trade them if you don't like them anymore or find other gamers and play their copies.
Wonder how many Malaysian tabletop players are lurking here :)? We should hold a meet up to play some games one day. 

I definitely feel the games are getting more pricier and pricier due to our devaluing currency. At this moment, it's almost RM 4.6 to USD 1! All the pre-ordered games don't look quite as cheap a month ago. As a Malaysian gamer we really to do some very smart shopping around. I'll share some tips with you:

1. If you found a game that you're very interested in and it happens to be published by small publisher or independent developers, check their price and buy directly from them. For example, I recently bought "Pax Renaissance" and "Bios: Genesis" from Sierra Madre Game, the game creator, Phil Eklund, was kind enough to allow combined shipment of EUR 7(!!) for both games and I received it less than 2 weeks. 

2. Having said so, I found buying from European dealers cheaper than local game stores, not to mentioned I buy direct from developers as well. Notable vendors are histogame and hexasim.

3. Look out for Black Friday Sales/Thanksgiving/Halloween/Christmas sales from overseas sellers. Games can get very cheap during festival season and I usually buy during these periods. Notable examples are Amazon (just 2 weeks ago Lost Cities was discounted up to 50%!) and Miniature Market (13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis was only ~USD 12 during Halloween sales). I'm fine with Miniature Market as their shipping rate is more competitive compared to the likes like Amazon or Cool Stuff Inc. If game + shipping are cheaper than local stores (meeples, boardgamecafe) = BUY.

4. Support pre-ordering programs. I love GMT games (Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth, COIN games, Command & Colors, etc.) and I only buy from them during P500 or Year End Sales at which P500 customers are entitled for 50% of discount for their ex stock games ^_^.

5. Buy second games from Facebook group Board Games To-Go (MY) if all above are not applicable :p. Examples are games like Agricola, Le Havre, Splendor, etc that have to go through distributor channel and sold through local stores. You can occasionally find bargain for games like these in the group since Euro games are not for everyone (including me). 

All in all I wanted to support FLGS like Meeples or boardgamecafe but their price is so much more expensive and hardly have sales. I also don't really mind to wait for awhile to purchase the games during sales and wait for the delivery to come. I have enough games to play but I also don't mind expanding the library during the sales and wait for few weeks for the game to arrive. 
Try finding some print and Play games you like and whip those up. I pnp Tiny Epic Galaxies and love it. All you need are 7 regular dice and some meeples.
Card games! One or two decks of cards gives you nearly unlimited replay. 

My personal favorite game is Canasta, but there are plenty of others.
Personally I'd be glad if something would keep me from buying new board games instead of playing all those wonderful pearls in my collection.
I was able to open it up and play one scenario a few weeks back.  There's a lot to like about **Galaxy Defenders**, as far as I can tell.  Love that they included some character progression through a campaign and the actual combat system is pretty engaging as well.

I'm not a fan of the ammo and jamming system combined - it just seems over the top and unnecessary.  Pick one or the other and work the rest of the game balance around that.
I have the Base game but haven't tried it. Would it play well with 2? Is the game hard to learn?
I thought it was a great game, I've played it by myself and also with groups of friends. The character progression is pretty fun, and I like the objective based scenarios that have you choosing between fulfilling the objectives and making for an easier next scenarios, or risking it by pushing a little further to attempt to level a hero.
I liked it a good bit, I'm pretty far into the campaign, although descent takes all my time now that the new app is out. 

My main complaint with GD is it felt like we got into a quagmire shootout too much. I wanted to move around more. 
I'd love to try it, but it's been out of print for a good while. I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts too given that many more tactical mini's games have since been released. 
Jamaica for $20.  Niiiice.   Too bad I'm poor.  :(  
If you live in the Minnesota area you can go to the FFG event center and pick up the stuff directly. No shipping. Which I know is probably not many of you...

I just purchased all the expansions for Battlelore 2nd edition from an online retailer a week or two ago. I paid the higher price for my "luxury" items.


Smooth move, ~~Exlax~~ Asmodee.
Thanks for the alert! I decided to pick up Hyperborea and Amerigo.
Has anyone actually gotten a shipping confirmation? Payment is still pending for me.
Some great deals there.  Too bad shipping to Canada is too much.
I wish I didn't see this.  Order in the way!
I have that old coffin box starter thing for Dust Tactics, anything in the Dust Tactics sale anyone recommends? 
Battlelore for $30? Sounds nice to me!

Also been meaning to get those GoT resin house cards for a while now. $5 a piece?! Fuck. Yes.

Well, Lannister was $10 for some reason, but still. Great prices! I ain't even mad about the $24 shipping :]
Anybody having trouble checking out? When I enter my shipping info I keep getting an error saying my zip code and state don't match.
How long will the sale last?
Are any of the Game of Thrones LCG packs here for the second edition, or just the first edition that's no longer supported?

Hmm... couple extra maps for Formula D for ten bucks?   Interest piqued.

Nek minnit

>$15 shipping to CA

Yeah nah, considering I can get it on my doorstep tomorrow for two dollars more from Amazon.
Thanks OP! I grabbed Black Fleet and Discoveries for $43 shipped 
Even in the US the shipping makes it not really worth it.
I take it these might be games on the chopping block?

Sad for Lords of Xidit.  It sells poorly so they must be overstocked, that's too bad :(
I picked up Eclipse for $50. Woohoo!
Anyone that ordered from them Thursday of last week, have you gotten a tracking number or shipment notification yet?


Anyone get an update from them? It's been a good week and nothing...
For those wondering about shipping I talked to someone from FFG (asmodeeNA, I guess now) And they are beginning shipping as of yesterday (11/28). I was told my order is in warehouse waiting to be picked up by carrier, but still haven't gotten any shipping info other than the original order confirmed email. 
How's **Black Fleet**? I saw the SU&SD review a while back, and it looked fun, but it was an earlier episode, and standards are constantly raising in the last few years with all these mindblowing new releases.

Mainly, I'm hoping it strikes a good balance between fun and skill. I don't want it to be too random, since my group is fond of euros, but we also do need more silly things too.
Wish shipping was better to Canada.  Oh well. 
Would be nice if the shipping was not 60 fucking dollars to Canada...
Tokaido has some decision making, but is generally considered quite the chill zen ride. Don't rightfully know how good it is at two though.
Carcassonne fills this niche for us.  Very simple and relaxing. 
King of Tokyo!! Mostly just dice rolls and fun!

Dice games are usually good for this. Like zombie dice, roll for the future, back to the future dice game, etc.


It's important for me to have a game that (a) is competitive, and (b) has something intrinsically enjoyable to do, such that we don't have to focus on winning or losing, but on enjoying the actual experience. I've listed below what games i enjoy intrinsically, and can be brain-light if you want.

Larger games
----------------------
Tokaido - it's the epitome of zen. And i like sightseeing and buying things. Count points at the end for less competition. 

Ticket to Ride - i like trains, i like travel. And i like trains. 

Roll for the Galaxy - i like building a civilisation, i like cute dice, i like space.

Junk Art - i like showing off my toys and artistic masterpieces.


Smaller games
----------------------
Coloretto - the rules are so light, i can play and chit chat at the same time. And i like set collection.

Dale of Merchants - i like animals, i like deckbuilding, and i like the art.

Archaeology - i like indiana jones, i like collecting stuff, and i like trading.

Kodama - i like growing trees, i like non-linear card laying, and i like the art.
**Patchwork** is my go to 2 player relaxing game. It's light but still have meaningful desicions to it. It has a nice tetris feel to it as well.
Valeria Card Kingdoms - Get the most victory points to win. Hire characters with a number on them, then roll two die. If the number is the number of the character you hired, you get the reward, like a merchant would give money which lets you hire more workers or buy domains(which give victory points), a warrior would give strength tokens that help you kill monsters (which also give victory points).
The game is light, it has a bit of decision making to make it meaningful but there's lots of dice rolling excitement and addictiveness Check out Rahdo's final thoughts on the game who normally likes thinky games.

**Camel Up** and **Colt Express**.
Steam Park is pretty good for this sort of thing. 
So I am probably a bit different: I like strategy games however I do enjoy just playing out competitive games in a light hearted do whatever seems cool sort of way. Kids today would define it as "YOLO" but I would prefer just to say switch of your brain and play by gut feel and invest in the ride rather than the result.

My games would be:

**Five Tribes** The king of AP games for some who try to solve the puzzle (Don't do that). If you can let that go it is really rewarding to play by feel. If you see a move, do it! Get points! Everyone is happy.

**Imperial Settlers (especially with new Aztec expansion)** Play a card, do the action. If you just go with the flow it is a great little game. Sure you can attempt to be the all conquering engine building master. But it's great to just stumble through playing the coolest card in your hand.


**Patchwork** doesn't have a lot of actions so you don't have to think too hard, and it's very visually pleasing.
Tales of the Arabian Nights is like the definitive "take me for a ride" board game. The official rules will have you playing for more like 2 hours, but you can honestly just stop when you both feel like you've had enough.
**Fluxx** is my go-to for this kind of mindless entertainment. I recommend you pick your favourite theme to add even more laughs/enjoyment.
Maybe something that's just fun and silly? I've been playing a lot of **Loony Quest** lately, and everyone has found it to be a riot. All you have to do is draw lines. It's one of those dexterity games that's just... Fun! No brain burning whatsoever.
**7 Wonders Duel**, **Jaipur**, **Biblios** and **Targi** should be good choices.
Just played **Jim Henson's Labyrinth** this weekend, and it fits the bill pretty well. It's a roll and move game with a bit of interesting decision making. It's also co-op, which I also find more relaxing than competitive. Bonus points for nice looking minis. If either of you are a fan of the movie, this game is definitely made by a fan for fans.
How about **Elder Sign**?
Little to no decision making: "The Game of Life"
Maybe a little bit different direction, but I recommend betrayal at house on the hill. It's a game my wife and I can play without having to worry about winning and just have fun enjoying the story that's being told. Something bad happens to one of our guys and we just laugh about. Bad things keep happening to the same person, laugh even more.
If you can find a copy, I recommend **Ra: The Dice Game**. It has all the elements of an euro but in such a compact and simple package. It's short, great for two and you can play it with a very relaxed mindset, just throwing the dice and watching where they take you.
A few games come to mind...

- **Tokaido** - The game of the path.  Enough said.

- **Sentinels of the Multiverse** - This is a cooperative game that I enjoy playing with my best friend when he and I need some time to just chill out.  Very thematic (superheroes.)  Initially it takes a bit of getting used to but as you get to know the various villains/heroes it gets easier to fight them and win the game.

- **Pandemic**  - There are some interesting decisions to be made but in the base game generally the number of decisions to be made are relatively simple (we have three bad things happening, and at some point we'd like to trade off this card in order to try to cure a disease.)  Also, learning Pandemic will give you a chance to prepare for Pandemic Legacy if you ever want to do that (spoiler, it's amazing and you should do so.)

- **Deep Sea Adventure** - I've never taught Deep Sea Adventure to someone who didn't like it.  It's a light little push your luck game about diving down to collect treasure.  There are few decisions to actually make and nothing that takes more than a second to decide.  This is best in large groups but it scales well from 2-6.

- **Stone Age** - It's a worker placement, but generally since you can only place workers on one location at a time you generally know that there are 4 best locations, 3 ok locations, etc. and you can prioritize where to place your workers based on a particular option.  There is decision making but I'd say less than Castles of Burgundy.  

Other thought that's kind of beyond what you asked for......

- **Dungeon Petz** - Now, dungeon petz is actually fairly heavy/midweight.  That said, it's a worker placement game about raising/selling/exhibiting your petz.  It's incredibly thematic ("Oh no, I'm forced to play this card so now my pet is angry and he just broke out of his cage and hurt the imp who was caring for it.") There are decisions to be made and a little bit of calculating points but so much of the game revolves around thematic decisions I think it might have an interesting place in your collection beyond the current moment.  The other reason why I'm putting it off to the side as "this isn't exactly what you asked for but maybe you should look at it" is because it is longer than an hour.

Why did no one mention *Candy Land* yet?
"Canon noir" in French, and bgg says it had the same name in english, or "black cannon" in the first edition.

http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18164/black-cannon

I still have the game, yes there was a working cannon, and if I remember correctly, if you touch an opponent's ship, you replace it with a smaller version, able to carry limited amount of treasures.

Every time I see one of these Dice Tower videos that includes Puerto Rico, they're always showing the 10th anniversary edition, and I get frustrated because if I'm going to buy Puerto Rico, I want that edition.  Really wish alea/Ravensburger could get the rights back.  Guess that might never happen though.  ([link](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/17301218#17301218), [link](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/17757953#17757953))
Has any one tried the Great Western Trail or Codex? Both seem interesting...
Best list I've ever seen. Now I'm adding Burano to my watchlist.
finally played **caylus** the other night. i can definitely appreciate it for it's historic impact on modern games, and i can't think of any games since that do exactly what it does, but it still feels a bit dated. i feel like more recent games have learned from it and streamlined some of the concepts quite a bit. my biggest complaint is that acquiring resources felt too slow and incremental (yes, i know, seeing how efficiently you can do this is part of the game). it's worth playing for anyone into heavier euros, but i don't think it's essential by any stretch.
Yes, you can. In fact, the game explicitly encourages you to play a game or two of normal Pandemic first if not everyone has played Pandemic before.
Valeria Card Kingdoms - 
A lot of reviewers are saying it's fixed machi koro. More fun, better strategy, quicker playtime, and a fantasy theme. I bought it but haven't played a real game, just a quick practice game.
Seems to work well with two player as Rahdo likes it. 
Get the most victory points to win. Hire characters with a number on them, then roll two die. If the number is the number of the character you hired, you get the reward, like a merchant would give money which lets you hire more workers or buy domains (which give victory points), a warrior would give strength tokens that help you kill monsters (which also give victory points).

Try the 5-5-2 variant http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/28048/what-is-5-5-2-variant-of-the-machi-koro

Dont think I'd ever play the Base game without it. It means you cant build your perfect engine and introduces a sort of drafting element to the game. 
Are you playing it with just the two of you guys? In my opinion **Machi Koro** really needs at least 4 people to play it.
I've never played **Machi Koro**, but I've heard it being compared to a lighter/less options version of **Dice City**.  I have played **Dice City** before and while I'm not big on dice games, I still did enjoy myself.
My favorite city building game is *Suburbia*. Might be worth looking into!
**Valeria Card Kingdoms** is very similar to Machi Koro but an improvement in any possible way. One major improvement is that you can also use the sum of both dice to get a card.

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170561/valeria-card-kingdoms
Mechanically its a little similar to **Catan** in that you roll to activate income streams :)
**Castles of Burgundy** is a game where you roll dice and buy chits to build a city.

You can manipulate dice rolls but there is no such thing as a bad dice roll, you can do something with every roll. 

Since it has these elements it is slightly more complicated than Machi koro but at the same time significantly deeper and more satisfying. 

If you're not playing it with the 5-5-2 variant, you're missing out.  https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1315037/3-draw-pile-variantpacing-improved

Additionally, I'm betting your SO had a lot of restaurants, which is what cost you so heavily? The way to defend against that is to buy the Publisher card, which radically disincentivizes going heavily into reds.   
I've been in a similar boat with **Machi Koro**, I didn't buy it but **Artifacts Inc** has similar dice rolling and development but with a little more meat. 
If she enjoys dice I would recommend **Kingsburg**. It's a dice placement game. With the resources you gather through the dice you build buildings which you use to defend your kingdom from armies at the end of a round. It's fairly simple and fun. It does have a fantasy theme though. Personally we enjoy it with two players, but you can play up to 4 players. 
If you want to stick to dice but go a meatier way: **Roll for the Galaxy** could be the way to go.

Way easier to access than it's Ancestor Race for the galaxy, but real solid depth.

If you want to stay in the league of Machi Koro but are open to moving away from  the dice try **Splendor**

And as mentioned: Machi Koro only shines with the expansion and 2-5-5 Play stile (2 violet, 5 low number, 5 high number buildings).
Mainly on theme/art, but I would recommend **Flip City**. It is a deck building/push your luck game where the buildings you buy (and/or flip) improve your deck, offering you various ways to win. It doesn't have any dice, but you are similarly buying cards to build your city (deck) and the push your luck element is fun. Similar weight, art/feel, it is inexpensive, and plays great with two while using some different basic mechanics.
The expansion for Machi Koro actually transforms it into a quite good and varied game. I didn't really like the base game either an won't play it without the expansion. 
One suggestion about Machi Koro. The rules as written make it take quite a long time. I accidentally came up with what I call the "Turbo version" which allows players to purchase as many cards as they can afford on one turn. It makes the game play faster, and introduces different strategies. Mix that in with the card selection rules from the Harbor expansion and it's like a new game!
**Dominion**, **Saint Petersburg**, and **Splendor** are some other light engine-building games, but without the randomness of the dice. 

**Roll Through the Ages** is a light Yahtzee-style dice game with civilization building aspects.
If you're sticking to the city building theme **Dice City**, as others recommended, is the way to go. For something a little different, check out **CV**, a dice rolling game where cards you buy create your life's story.
Colony is a slightly heavier dice manipulation game.  I hate to say they are similar but it's a clever and accessible dice game.
How about another city builder like Imperial Settlers? No dice though
Castles of burgundy!
If you want games that have the same level of player involvement, I suggest **War**, the card game.

If you want great games that have die-rolling resource production, you really can't go better than **Catan**. It's not great 2 player, but with 3 or 4 it's a lot of fun.
I'm not sure the posting rules and I'm on mobile, but I thought this was a good deal so I posted it. I love board games and this will be the first of my collection instead of my parents. I'm excited. 
I would recommend **Star Realms**. It's a great two player game and the app is great on a larger screen like an iPad. They have the pass and play mode but also challenge mode for when you're apart and mission mode for a single player. 
The Ascension app is pretty great, it does all the maths with the card interactions for you, and it's pass and play.
Splendor on Android is AMAZING.it basically removes the only con for paper splendor for me which is people being upset,but on the app you play against AI so thats not a problem.
Galaxy Trucker!
Patchwork. It's asynchronous, lighter, and one of my favorite two player games ever. My girlfriend and I play it all the time, and we play cross-platform as well.  
My favourite boardgame app, partly because I love the game and partly because I think it's a brilliant implementation, is **Neuroshima Hex!** 

It has undo functionality, too! 

Other than that, I think most of the games I got from the most recent Humble Bundle had pretty good pass and play: Ticket to Ride, Small World 2, Labyrinth. Splendor's pass and play is annoyingly buggy but playable. Most of them are pretty simple as well. 
On iOS I play Carcassonne and Lords of Waterdeep a lot. Downloaded Agricola but haven't played it yet, and Castles of Mad King Ludwig doesn't look too good on my phone but it may be better on iPad
Paperback
San Juan is excellent
Ticket to ride
Sentinels of the multiverse is an incredible amount of fun. The expansions are not super cheap but they add so much to the game. 

Edit - I never post anything or upvote. Very passive user. This game deserves to be played by people who like playing games.

Coup and Patchwork come to mind. I am not 100% sure about these ones, but they're both by the same dev as Patchwork: Le Havre: The Inland Port, Agricola: Al Creatures Big and Small.
I really enjoyed playing Elder Sign and Talisman on mobile. They worked very well for pass and play when I didn't really have any physical games to play.
Star Realms does networked based play. It's great for couples play
Dire Wolf did an excellent job with **Lanterns**, awesome port of it.
Ascension and Catan are my most played. 6 Takes (6 Nimmt) would fit the bill too.
I think Suburbia has pass and play as well. 
As an obsessive video gamer, i like content, variety, and the feeling of mastery in my board game ports. My reviews:

**Andromion**:  so much variety!!! So easy to use. Different AI.  Achievements.  Lots of ways to tinker.  I felt like it got better playing this.  But now you can't get it via play store :(

**Ticket to Ride**:  Eh.  Would be neat if at had a World Tour mode and could tinker with all kinds of variables being a video game.  Naturally it's great if you do have a good TtR group.

**Small World**:  like Ttr, had potential, especially if it implemented Realms creatable scenarios and such.

**Steam Rails to Riches**:  this was based off Railroad Tycoon.  If RR Tycoon was on mobile, this would blow away Steam.  Same map, same gameplay. No new maps, no campaign.  No map editor.

**Catan**:  when I got this years ago, the CAMPAIGN was locked!!  This defies all logic to me as a video game.  Hopefully this isn't true anymore.

**Galaxy Trucker**:   Yes yes yes yes yes yes.  This is what I want.  Holy crap this is goes beyond what a licensed board game does.  They did everything I wanted!  Campaign, progression, tinkering with the rules, wow wow wow.   I beat this and was so happy.  Pass and play!!  Turn based, I made this on bgg so you can play it with the actual board game.

Again, this goes three steps above nearly every other board game app.

Congrats to the devs for this.

**Suburbia**: I just got Planet Coaster for PC.  So suburbia gives me the warm fuzzy feeling Planet Coaster gave me.  The 3 star challenges are lovely.  Now I want to make solo challenges for the board game.

**Neuroshima Hex**:  so much wasted potential.  Imagine being able to recruit tiles and play matches in a campaign, like Microprose Magic or Puzzle Quest.

Anyways, the game is ok.  Hard incentive to keep playing.  My version doesn't have a quick reference option :(
Games with apps so good, they work better than the real thing: 

* Star Realms

* Splendor

* Neuroshima Hex

* Small World
**Ortus Regni** - The digital version is a work of art.
Carcassonne is great on the iPad/ tablet , also Ticket to Ride is good and usually on sale a lot in the App Store  
[Reiner Knizia's Ingenious](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.massivespace.ingenious&hl=en) is a really solid app for a simple to learn, tricky to master game about tile placement and combos. Definitely great at two player, controls for spinning/swapping/placing tiles feel great, and it's perfect for waiting in line at a restaurant.

Plus it's $1.99 so not much of a risk :)
Red7 has a good implementation with pass-and-play support.
Not sure if Castles of Mad King Ludwig is on android, but it's great on iOS. 
I'm really enjoying the pathfinder adventure card game. 
I've recently downloaded Cthulhu Realms and it's pretty great. It offers a lot of content for free.
>I guess what I had been hoping for was for them to be designed for pass and play and it doesn't really seem like they are.

I seem to remember that all the ones I've tried have included pass and play. Which games specifically don't have it?
**Galaxy Trucker** has a local multi-player, or you can setup "online" games with reserved spots for named players (i.e.: for just the two of you). 
I don't know about Android, but the iOS Agricola is an almost-perfect recreation of the board game.
The newest ones that I like to play currently are Paperback, Lanterns, and Stone Age. Agricola has a great app implementation, as does Lords of Waterdeep and all of the small box Uwe games. I also love Ticket to Ride, Battle Line, Sushi Go, Baseball Highlights, Carcassonne, and Splendor. Also Splendor just Added online play. Red 7 just launched an app and if you like Tokaido, they should be launching their app very soon.
You have 24 hours to get in on the [Humble Mobile Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/mobile/board-games-mobile-bundle) which has a load of good boardgames in it.  Carcassonne and Small World 2 are pretty short and pretty great, and I can vouch for Galaxy Trucker being fun as well even if you're doing the solo "campaign" while your friends are unavailable.
Elder Sign is my favorite game on Android.  The production values are through the roof and it plays really well.  Ticket to Ride is the runner up.
Are we talking about the bundle that's up right now? Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride are in that bundle and both have pass and play.

ETA: and San Juan and Galaxy Trucker
Smallworld is an excellent translation
I don't know anything about Android, but I think Small World is excellent on the iPad. No tedious setup or cleanup, and because nobody has a hand to keep secret, you don't have to pass it around. You just set in in the middle of the table and play. 
Lords of Waterdeep, Ascension, Star Realms, Neuroshima Hex, Heroes of the Multiverse. See the website pockettactics for more great ideas. Oh, Agricola!
I have a lot of down time at work and I play a lot on my tablet. My most played games are definitely Carcassonne, Elder Sign: Omens, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, and Galaxy Trucker. As far as a quality digital version is concerned, I think Pandemic is the best one out there. The only ones I've played that I would recommend against are Catan (the AI is a dirty cheater) and Small World (the text is bugged and sometimes unreadable to see what buffs you have). 
"Colt Express" is coming soon any day now to iOS and Android. It's on Steam as of three days ago. Can't wait for it!!!!
The ones I've played, always from an iPhone 6s screen perspective

**Galaxy Trucker** Great, better than the board game actually (housekeeping the flight phase is a pain in the ass)

**Ascension** I don't like this game but the app is ok. A bit too small for an iPhone 6 screen.

**Neuroshima Hex** Great, good implementation and screen visibility. 

**Star realms** Awful. Closed it in 10 seconds, never want to look at it again. It's all so small you can't see a single thing. Maybe try with an iPad.
**Stone Age** We actually prefer it on a mobile device over our physical copy. 
I love most of the apps mentioned here but one not mentioned much is Twilight struggle. We just downloaded this last night - it's not available in Android, ios and steam only I think, but it is very very well done. Great interface 
Pandemic, I would say small world 2 but iirc you got that from the humble bundle. 
**Agricola: ACBaS** got a great app. I enjoy it quite a bit. 
I've shared a lot of opinions on this game around the web, including a [written review](http://www.miniaturemarket.com/runebound3rdeditionreview.html) I did right after it came out.

I'm a big fan of it. The fantasy story is generic, in a good way. Trolls are trolls, giants are giant, so you don't need to get bogged down in learning a wholly unique fantasy tableau for the sake of it. Where the story becomes unique is in how *the player* interacts with it and the path they take. 

Token combat is awesome, and they're already showing new things they can do with them in the expansions which is great. The Fall of the Dark Star scenario expansion is an excellent one because it changes the whole structure of the scenario away from "Kill Big Bad Evil Thing". The system has a lot of flexibility. Unfortunately, the expansions make set up very fiddly. I like Runebound because it's a casual beer and pretzels adventure game, and expansion set up takes a bit away from that.
It's okay. The action system and the sense of progression are nice; the world seems kind of generic. I was expecting to like the combat system more than I did - there's nothing wrong with it, but most of the time, your choices are obvious.
I like the game, i would buy more, but i consider the 4 expansions FFG have released thus far to be a ripoff. should have been 2 expansions at most, and perhaps only 1.

so unfortunately not new runebound for me at this time.
I got it as a present during the summer and it's still one of my favorite games. Played it recently with my gaming group and they all really enjoyed it. With 3 players it took us 3.5 hours and it didn't feel like it at all. Time flew. The token combat is great and beefing up your character is satisfying. I've also played it solo with 2 characters (trying to choose the best options in combat) and it works quite well. I definitely plan on getting the expansions at some point when they are on sale. The game reminds me of Talisman with its fantasy style and going around trying to level up but IMO it's far superior and better designed. Would recommend 10/10
It's only like $15 on amazon. How cheap are we talking?
It could be doable, but you would need a list of all the character's abilities. There's 16 characters which each have a sentence or two ability you would need to reference for. The game play itself is all based on the symbols on the dice which don't depend on which language the rules are in.

Edit: On BGG there is [the official English rulebook](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/95743/bang-dice-game-english-rules) which includes the rules text for each character.
You can't play the German version without knowing any German. You'd at least need to put paste ups on the character cards, or print the character section from the rulebook for each player. At that point you might just buy the English version, unless you get it for free. 
My only concern would be the character's card, because they include text concerning each one's special abilities

You can always have a printed english manual for reference but I find it a little annoying for 1st time players
The English version has both English and Italian on each card. Does the German version have another language?

The character cards are language dependent. If you can't read them, you won't be able to play very easily.
Depends. How good is your Italian?
I took a look, looks interesting!

I dream of designing my own game so a big prop to you and I wish you great success!
Already a backer, and I'm very pleased with the stretch goals so far! I appreciate how passionate you are about the project, and I'm sure it comes through in the game. I'm excited to get a copy!
Looks like an interesting game you have there! The price is reasonable, and postage isn't a big deal to me here in Ireland either. My board game budget isn't in the best of shape at the moment, but I've added this to my watch list, and I may just make the plunge before the campaign ends. Best of luck.
Love it.

* Observations:-

I wanted to know what the actual strategy is as well as the "how to play" which is beautifully simple and minimalist.

The bearded youtube vid helped, but I'd like a diagram box of some strategy moves illustrated to SHOW the strategy involved? Might help.

Backing it.

Is there chance to get for xmas ?! "the perfect package inside a xmas present" meme,, ho-ho-ho!
Thanks all! We just hit 500% funded and the analytics on Kickstarter tell me that half a dozen backers have come from Reddit!

Big love guys!
My church used to do a Chicken-Foot Domino Tournament. Just get a bunch of double-9 or double-6 sets, which you can probably find at a dollar store. Ours was kind of intense, with someone running a computer program that tracked everyone's scores, but you could do it on paper, too.

Let me know if you want more details.
Liar's Dice might be fun. You can buy it online (also marketed as Perudo), but you just need 6 dice and a dice cup per person, and the rules are online. And I think you can download tournament rules on boardgamegeek.com, as well as read about rules variants, etc.
BezzerWizzer is a blast, check it out. 
"Terra" had a nice "you don't need the exact answer, just be closest" kind f feel to it, good fun as well.
**Timeline**, **Cardline**, and **Timeline Challenge** aren't straight forward trivia, but come close.
Smarty Party can be fun, and I also enjoy BezzerWizzer. Although my favorite is America, which has a little more strategy involved than most trivia games.
**Linkee** is a really fun trivia game where you're also trying to guess the connection between the trivia answers
Smart Ass. The people love the game and love to make the joke "Look Ron. This game has your name written all over it"
**smart ass** is very fun
 Cranium is always fun with the trivia crowd. 

I wonder if amazon or target might ship wits and wagers to you?


I don't know if it would be the case in New Zealand, but I see Wits and Wagers on thrift store shelves fairly frequently here in the states. Who knows, might get lucky?

Also, not exactly a trivia game, but I think Balderdash definitely has some similarities. A player draws a card with a definition for an extremely obscure word, and everyone at the table tries to write a phony definition that's just convincing enough to get people to vote for it. As an old parlor-style game, you can also find resources to play it online without necessarily having to purchase a manufactured copy.
I would suggest avoiding **Wits and Wagers** if you're not based in the US. Most of the questions have a US slant to them (lots of baseball, basketball and American football) and they use imperial measuring systems, so it's not as much fun if that isn't your background.

**Timeline** is really fun though and always gets new players quite invested. I also suggest **Geek Out**, which mixes trivia with bluffing and bidding - but you need to play with other nerds as the questions are all about sci-fi/fantasy/videogames/etc.

Lastly, I've made my own trivia game, for which I'm currently seeking playtesters. The idea behind it is that questions are framed in a way that allows players to deduce answers, even if they are not 100% sure - opening the window to bluffing the other team, etc. There is currently a 3-page demo print-and-play, which is enough for one game - drop me a message if you'd like me to share it with you.

EDIT: A quick suggestion is to combine Wits and Wagers with Timeline, using the Wits and Wagers system with the Timeline questions. My game group had a blast with that!

It really comes down to how many people do you guys typically play with.  If it's just the two of you then **TtA** is 100% the game you want to go with.  If it's 4 or more then definitely **Eclipse**.

But both are great games, so you shouldn't be disappointed as long as you are looking for a heavy game.
The new version of **Through the Ages** is really good.  It's been rebalanced and streamlined.  It will definitely give you that Civ experience.  I would go for that one over Eclipse (I own both).  If you had told me you liked Master of Orion 2, then I would have picked the other :)
Civ fan from the original (incidentally haven't played much of V and VI) -- TTA (a NEW story of civ) is basically the Civ tech tree & city/population management turning in boardgame.

If you want a taste of TTA, you can play it for free at www.boardgaming-online.com -- try before you buy! (the implementation feels a little bit better than the one at www.boardgamearena.com, but also available at the latter, also free)

edit: gf has never played the Civ series, but playing TTA online had her feeling the "just one more turn .." hook. and then before you know it, it's 3 hrs later.
They're both so great, you probably can't go wrong with either. If it's just mostly you two playing then get Through the Ages, but it's if it's a group of 4+ that meets regularly, get Eclipse. You don't want to play TtA with more than 3 and Eclipse base game plays up to 6 beautifully.

Whichever one you choose, consider also getting the acrylic overlays like these for Eclipse (http://www.thebrokentoken.com/eclipse-resource-trays/) or these for TtA (https://www.boardgameinnovation.com/through-the-ages/) it will save you major headaches from a table bump
I got Eclipse for 50 bucks on that Asmodee Holiday Sale site, not sure if it's still in stock.
TtA is great at 2 and 3 and okayish at 4, eclipse is meh at 2, ok at 3 and great at 4+, so in that way you're better off with tta. 
Tta also gives you the civ feeling better i think although you don't have the explore part, which is exactly the reason i love it,  but some people miss that.  

For truly the most 'civ-like' game you should look at clash of cultures or just civilization,  both fine games.  But TTA is the best of these and such a good two player game, it does take a bit long to play but that time goes down very quickly after the first couple plays.  
TtA is a truly great game but it's is considerably heavier then what you've played before. It's also quite long, taking a good three hours to get through the reduced (no age III) game.

Have you considered **Food Chain Magnate**, which is similarly long and heavy?
I would recommend against Eclipse. My group likes their share of longer Euro games (agricola, power grid, etc.) but Eclipse's setup and gameplay was simply too slow. You sit around doing nothing for long periods of time when its not your turn, and there isn't too much social/trading going on either to fill up these gaps. Plus the game simply takes too long.

Theoretically I like the game, but in practice it turned out not so well for us.
If you are really looking for a euro that still gives you that "epic" feeling and has a bit more depth, take a look at "Scythe" (if you didn't already). I have played all 3 and it just has an elegant beauty that is unmatched.
XCOM is fun coop. 

Fortunes and glory. Battle Nazis or the mob while being Indiana jones style relic hunters. 1+ player, team coop and versus options. Really fun!

Splendor is nice but I'd demo it first just in case. Not sure you'd like it based on your no-no list. 

You might also enjoy smash up. Tons of expansions makes for very interesting
Combinations every time it's played. 2 player is fun and it also scales up very well, especially when expansions mixed into things!

Card wise, you may enjoy fluxx. Lots of different theme decks, very fast play but because of the nature of the game it rarely
Plays the same way. 

AEG makes tons of great card games for 2+ players. Haven't found any yet that I don't enjoy. Many of their games are very compact little bags too so you could bring them with you on duty. 

Coup is fun and scales up well. Fun bluffing game. This could be played with 2 and it's compact so you could buy a deck for when you're on duty and play with others as well!
Splendor works well 2 player and scales well.
**Targi** (2 player worker placement game) is highly regarded. 

**Ravens of Thri Sahashri** is a two-player coop puzzle game.

Beyond Baker Street. Very much enjoy it with my wife, but plays up to four just as well. Better than the comparative Hanabi, with more to do and ways to play. 
My best friend/ex and I have a similar issue in terms of us playing a lot of games with large groups but sometimes we don't want to deal with the hassle of other pain in the ass people, so I started picking up other games that work well for us and that play with more.

**Seasons** was a surprise hit for us and you could repack the components into a relatively small box if you want to ditch the large box.  It's a card game with a dice aspect where the number of dice used scales by player.  It does start with a draft so it can be relatively chesslike at two.  It's excellent at two.  It's excellent at five.  It's very fun to learn it with a SO and learn the cards on equal footing and you'll notice likely that different people value cards differently out of the gate and you'll learn eventually various cards to chain together for crazy results.

**Food Chain Magnate** scales very well between 2-5.  It's a heavy, unforgiving game and more economic than most of what you listed but it's insanely good.  Note that this requires a lot of table space unless you purchase an insert for the box.

Worker placement games tend to scale relatively well because generally you just make less spaces available depending on number of players.  **Stone Age** is the one that's generally most well known, I would say, and has a heavy dice component.  I'm not sure if you'd like Stone Age though based on your dislike for Castles of Burgundy.  **Dungeon Petz** is more economic and does not have dice (instead there's a little mind game where you have to decide between taking more actions vs. having first choice in actions.)

You can also try other versions of hidden movement games since you liked Letters from Whitechapel.  Letters is generally the most "pure deductive" in the genre, where the others have more bells and whistles.  I love hidden movement games and am a huge fan of **Specter Ops** and **Fury of Dracula**.  Specter Ops changes quite a bit depending on number of players (at 5 there's a traitor, for example.)  My army friends LOVE Specter Ops.  Letters from Whitechapel is more of a race, while **Specter Ops** has the hunters spending more time trying to hold lines of sight and impair the agent's movement while they narrow down location.  **Fury of Dracula** is the longest in the genre and is about to go out of print and revolves much more around head to head combat / getting inside each others' heads for a rock-paper-scissors style game.  Both **Specter Ops** and **Fury of Dracula** give characters special abilities and various cards so there are more bells and whistles / distractions / things to do if you can't track down the person you're hunting.

**Sentinels of the Multiverse** is a cooperative, superhero themed card game that's great for 2-5, although you might want to play your first few two player games with two characters each.

First, thank you for your service.

Not sure, but this might give you some ideas. Here are some 2p games that my wife and I enjoy playing together: 

**Dominion, Robinson Crusoe, Runebound, Lords of Waterdeep, Memoir 44,  Merchants & Marauders**
You may enjoy **7 Wonders: Deul**. One of the best 2 player games I've ever played. It's a good strategy game with very little randomness (just a bit at the start) because you can see most of the cards before they are available.
Splendor and 7 wonders duel
So, what do you do for a living?
Looks like you two can handle some heavier stuff, which is great! I recently got into FFG's new coop card game Arkham Horror LCG and it is really fun. It plays 1-4 players and has a great mix of mechanical challenges and narrative storytelling. Replayability is not as high as a more traditional game, but you really do get the sense of going through a story/adventure together. And as a LCG, they publish a new scenario each month. Since you like Sherlock Holmes this may be a good pick for you.
Space Hulk: Death Angel, a nice coop card game that's relatively small and very hard.
Nothing Personal has many more opportunities for negotiation and deals, and it has the very interesting element of the family tree. Sons of anarchy felt really flat for us, but at least it's a shorter game... I would say Nothing personal is much better in any case. 
**Skull** would be good. It's pretty good because it has that feeling of outwitting the other players without actually having direct conflict of any kind. It's also pretty social because you have to try to read the other players behaviours. It's also fast and can support a fair large number of players. If you want to try it out without buying the commercial game, then you can play it pretty easily with a regular deck of playing cards (poker cards).

(You may find the bluffing aspect will appeal to a certain percentage of your crowd but will turn off another percentage. I don't think this is a reason to not get it, just something to be aware of and plan around. Some people just find it very hard reading body language and others find it difficult being dishonest, even within the confines of a game.)
If **Rhino Hero** worked well, then I would definitely suggest grabbing **Junk Art**, that game has quickly become my favorite dexterity game.

It may seem a bit odd, but I could definitely imagine myself and a bunch of friends really enjoying **Codenames** growing up.  It's dealing with words, but it the game is still so silly and approachable that I can see even 13 year olds enjoying it.  You might want to ease them in with **Codenames: Pictures** though.

And if you want to take a risk, but with a very high reward, I would go with **Captain Sonar**.  Each moving piece in the game is actually very simple to grasp, but the game becomes a bit hard for people when they have to combine them all with working as a team.  It may not work with kids that can't sit in their seats for long, but I can definitely see this being a hit if you can convince at least 6 kids and a couple of adults to try it out.  After that the rest should notice how interesting it is and follow along.
Why not find someone on vassel or bgg to do an email game or something?  

Or just do what I do and constantly rile people who don't like playing games into playing games untill they relent.  
If I were you I'd try to find a board gaming Meetup, go a few times and just keep asking if people are interested.
Do you have an FLGS? You could put up a flyer or post on their social media sites asking for players. If you've already spent the money and you're just itching to play, I'd point out in your ad that there's no cost to play (unless your FLGS has a table fee, in which case I'd probably ask the group to split it).
It's not the worst idea ever, the story book and unlocking and exploration things may make it sort of interesting. 

You'd lose a lot of the interaction between players though in terms of enmity etc, but it may be fun to put people on very different upgrade paths and see how it turns out for each of them. 
yeah i agree this could be fun because the story is quite cool. however adding to the other comments, i wouldn't run five factions. i think 3 would be more than enough.

one idea you could do is to put all of the guilds (actions) into a hat (or a random generator spreadsheet or something) and each time you change to a new province's turn, pick two out of the hat and then you choose one to do. makes it a bit more challenging and also acts like an actual other person picking what that guy is going to do!
see 16 minutes onward on [this SUSD video](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/review-seafall/)
Man I know this exact same feeling! I wish I could play with ya dude. 
Hey man, it's all good. I've played partial games of **War of the Ring** where I am playing both sides. It's actually a pretty good time.
Yeah, it'd be fine to do that.  I definitely do not recommend 5p.  I suggest doing 3p and if you really want to add in a fourth in game 3ish, check the rules for adding and removing players.  You could even sideline one faction or another after a big defeat for additional narrative punch.  Good luck!
I've actually thought about if SeaFall could be played purely solo as a single province, and theoretically it can be.  There's nothing that requires you to interact with other players to progress the main campaign, so you could theoretically just go around and do stuff until you hit the target glory in each game.  

You could also theoretically play this game solo as multiple characters.  There's very little hidden information in the game, and it comes later in the campaign and is pretty minor, nothing game-breaking if all players were to know it.  I would recommend playing as 3 provinces just so that there's less book-keeping to keep track of in your head, and to make games a little shorter.  
My only problem with just gathering up a local group of strangers or like minded gamers is that for a Legacy game, I'd want to have people who are dedicated towards finishing the campaign. I've seen a lot of reviews for the game where people only played 6-7 games and that seemed to be their limit of the enjoyment. 

Trying to gather up a dedicated group of gamers for anything nowadays is like pulling teeth from a Leviathan that stays on the bottom of the ocean and never opens it's mouth.

And my worst fear would be starting a game of Seafall with a group of players, where they have the pleasure of naming several components such as factions, advisors, ships and islands only to decide they don't want to play anymore after 1-2 games. Leaving someone else to pick up the place of a faction they didn't get to create.
I interact with my friends that I'm playing the game with? 
I talk to other players. We just chat and hang out and when it rolls around to your turn you do it. Or watch their turns and be involved in that way. Downtime bothers me the least out of my main groups I play in. 
i pay attention to other people's turns and acknowledge their actions because I feel it is courteous. I find it very awkward when I'm taking my turn and no is paying attention.
Mage Knight is definitely a one or two player game. That leads me to my answer which is that I just don't play games with long downtime. Downtime is the biggest killer of fun for my by far. If a game has unbearable downtime, it's going on the trade pile. 
obviously an ideal answer is enjoy the company of my friends. What actually happens is i eat all the snacks. Not a healthy habit. 
I only play **Mage Knight** solo. I just avoid large player counts for games with long down time.

If you must play with 4, you could always throw in filler games, or have another longer game running on the side.
Several ways:

*If I'm at my FLGS* - I get up and walk around and see what others are doing.

*If I'm at home with friends* - I joke around and talk, occasionally I'll get up and cook something.

*If I'm playing with people that have played the game many times* - I push them to make faster turns, often times we will all agree to play with a timer.
8-9 hours is over the top honestly. There is 'talk to your friends' answers but really, for eight hours? Mans hungry and tired by then.
i've gotten more patient over time, but this still kills me. among the guys i like to play heavy games with (who are also my friends), a few are very AP prone. it can make games that i would otherwise enjoy really boring and even frustrating. i also just know to turn down lots of games because the playtime will be 1-3 hours more than advertised.

i do like interacting with my friends during the downtime, but i also want whosever turn it is to not tell stories etc. finish your turn and then rejoin the conversation. i think it's fair that if other people are waiting to play, you should make an effort to at least not get distracted on your turn. i've been scolded for asking people to do this though...
Your first mistake was playing a four player game of Mage Knight haha

But for me I don't like a lot of down time when I already know what I want to do.  If the time between turns involves me planning my turn for most of it I'm cool, but I do get annoyed when I've figured out what I want to do and have to wait awhile.  I have one friend in particular that's AP prone and it can become bothersome.  We usually take out a timer if he takes too long to get him moving.  Something about it just takes me out of the game.  

Usually during that downtime I'll talk to a friend, browse reddit, text someone, watch a game that's on TV, etc. 
When folks are starting to take too long we sometimes will stand up during our turns. Seems to move things along.
The most important thing is to pick the right games and to know your audience. Personally, I'm fine with all but the most extreme amount of downtime. I used to play with another guy who must have had severe ADHD because he would start sighing loudly and drumming on the table during any game with more than a minute or so or downtime. I would try and avoid certain games with him because I knew it would end up getting awkward and annoying.

I have no problem with 4-player Mage Knight but I would only want to play with 3 other like-minded people. It really is just a matter of getting the right mix of players. 8-9 hours is definitely long though. You can always give gentle reminders that the world is not resting on the ability to perfectly optimize a hand of cards in Mage Knight. Sometimes you just need to discipline and self-awareness to accept a solution that you know is not perfect for the sake of the table.
Chiming in with the others that 4p Mage Knight is a mistake. I think three is playable, but only if everyone is quite familiar with the game, otherwise 2 max.
I haven't played Mage Knight, but in general what I do is run through my strategy, hash out different alternate strategies, do a little math to see if different things might work out better....etc.
The most politically correct way to deal with it is that first everyone have to agree on a certain time frame for each turn, say 3 minutes. During the 3 minutes no one can perform any action besides contemplation of moves. Actions can only be performed at exactly 3 minutes. So hopefully people favor high down time or low down time will be a bit more considerate.
I don't play games with excessive players, and I will leave if it's a problem. I can *maybe* tolerate downtime if there's table talk, but my fiancee absolutely can't put up with it.

In one of my groups, there are two guys who have absolutely no ability to distinguish between "has components for 8" and "is fun with 8," and to make matters worse, they're ridiculously bad at recognizing when other people are bored. I have been known to lead an exodus when the pace is getting out of hand.

"It's been an hour. Is anyone close to winning? No? Alright, I think this is a four-player game, maximum. I'm going to set up Carcassonne at that table, and anyone who wants to join me is welcome." If players ditching early is a problem (which it usually isn't), the players who want to finish the game take over for the empty seats. It's blunt, but it works and doesn't leave hard feelings.
Playing with good friends that you can freely joke and jest with doesn't even make you realize there is a downtime.
Set the expectation that everybody talks through all of their turns.  Actually verbalize every decision made and bring others into your thought process.  I think the reason people get bored when it's not their turn is because they feel like they aren't doing anything, but talking out every piece of the game gives everybody else the opportunity to weigh in on what the acting player should do, make fun of others when they make bad moves (keeping it upbeat and impersonal as your group may need), and negotiate moves that might affect the others.

I get bored when I play with people who don't like to talk out their turns.  But if you start by talking out your turns, people typically follow suit and everybody has a better time.  Yeah, the game gets less competitive as you no longer have this silent, calculating adversary on the other side, but if you're just playing for fun, I think talking a lot makes it more fun.

And as others have said: the downtime is a huge issue with Mage Knight with more than two players.  If your crew isn't up for talking through everything and gets bored watching others take a long time, then that game might be replaced by something with shorter turns.
I would love to try this: https://www.amazon.com/Cube-Timer-Chess-Clock-Book/dp/B004S56RJG

If only I could get a game group to use it.
You set up another game of mage knight on another table and switch turn order up so when you're finished on one table, it will be your turn at the next etc.
Typically we just throw Yugioh or something on Hulu, gives you something to do, but isn't distracting enough to exacerbate the issue.
Civilization the Board Game. It's quite interesting. Me and my older brother used to play when we were younger to kill a long dreary weekend. Can take a few hours to finish, and like the PC game, you advance your technologies slowly through the game. Hope this helps!
good idea
Good idea. I waxed the board instead. Got rid of the jerkiness and helps protect the board. 
Interesting idea! I'd be a little nervous it would affect the magnet strength, we already tend to lose our striker on hard shots, not sure how adding more distance would work. Did you felt the steering magnet as well?

I wonder if someone could create a pair of striker/steering pieces felted on both sides but with stronger magnets.
i guess thin neoprene/old mouse pad might work too?
Can't really help with the rest of the stuff, but just to throw my two cents in about Hogwarts Battle: If you REALLY love Harry Potter, you'll love this. Solid Deckbuilder with a Legacy style set up. If you are "eh" about Harry Potter, I would pass on this because as a deckbuilder it's sub-par when compared to games like Ascension or Dominion. Still a good game, but if you already own Ascension or Dominion, and the theme isn't that important to you, I would pass on it.
My four-year-old and I play **Brandon the Brave**, **Monza**, **Rhino Hero**, **Loopin' Louie**, **Pie Face**, **Let's Go Fishing**, **Animal Upon Animal**, **Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood Grr-rific Game**, **Connect Four**, **Go** in 9x9, and various matching memory games. 

The cool thing about four is that they're finally able to sit down and focus just long enough to learn and ***actually play*** simple short games, as opposed to taking two turns and leaving the table frustrated. You'll want stuff with low downtime for each player, at most three mechanisms for them to keep track of, and simple first past the post gameplay. The goal of many games at this age is simply teaching sportsmanship: taking turns, passing play, accepting adversity. I'll often modify games a bit to adjust for these parameters: if there's downtime, I'll ask my boy to help me take my turn and talk through strategy. And the first few times we play competitive games I'll do very little to impede his success in order for him to develop a firm grasp on the path to victory. After he can see how to win, that's when I'll start to take actions that introduce adversity to challenge him to adapt and overcome. 

As for which games YOU and your older friends will also enjoy, you almost can't go wrong with anything published by **[HABA](https://boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=rank&advsearch=1&q=&include%5Bdesignerid%5D=&include%5Bpublisherid%5D=384&geekitemname=HABA+-+Habermaa%C3%9F+GmbH&range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D=&colfiltertype=&searchuser=Zwaloo&playerrangetype=normal&propertyids%5B0%5D=1041&B1=Submit)**.

My first Carcassonne. My 4 year old nephew loves it!
Pretty much any Haba game . Try rhino hero , animal upon animal or dragon rapid fire . 
Click Clack Lumberjack (or Bling Bling Gemstone, if you can find it)

Magic Labyrinth

Outfoxed

My First Carcassonne

Enchanted Tower

Animal Upoon Animal (we have Small Yet Great, but probably the regular game with the bigger pieces is better)

This is based on games my 4-year-old likes to play, and I don't mind playing with him. He has others that are more annoying as an adult.
My 4.5y/o picked up and loves Castle Panic
Considered Tsuro yet? (Classic, not seafaring version.) Great way to build visual problem solving skills. 
My 4 year old likes King of Tokyo and Forbidden Island. Both require a lot of prompting and assistance though at his age
All the kids I introduce Sleeping Queens to really seem to enjoy it. It's a great matching/adding/attacking/defending game. I even enjoy playing it.
Our kids love playing Spot It. There are enough variations that you can get one that suits their interests (Frozen, Shopkins)

Second the recommendation for King of Tokyo. I regularly get beat by my kids. 

Qwirkle is a fun matching game, we play with all the tiles facing up so we can help pick out matches. 

Feed the Woozle is a goofy party game that's cooperative, with all the players against the game.
Friend's 4y/o girl absolutely loves **Patchwork**.  She's a pretty bright kid and picked up on it within watching one play w/me vs. her dad.  Now she's requesting it everytime we go over
City of Zombies is very good (it's a maths game) , also Ticket to Ride is OK for kids if you go through the rules carefully. Also Quoridor went down very well with my 4 yr old. 
Toc Toc woodman and outfoxed
My 4 year old daughter's most advanced games are love letter, roll for it, coloretto, dixit (her fav), rhino hero, and trophy buck (zombie dice reskin). 

But we started at 3 with games like animal upon animal and mini orchard (still one of her favorites) 
I can second **Brandon the Brave** and **Rhino Hero**, my daughter is 4 1/2 and loves those. She also loves **Stick Stack** (Target exclusive), **Get Bit** and **Shark Attack**, and lately is really enamored with **Mice and Mystics**, though we don't play the full game with all the rules. I posed about my experience here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5cr6ks/mice_and_mystics_with_3_and_4_year_old/

That takes a lot of prep though, definitely not for everyone. We're about to start mission 5 and the kids love it. 
I have a 4 year old girl and she loves anything by Orchard Games (usually memory or race games). 

She also loves My First Carcassonne, though she more appreciates the 'world building' element than the actual strategy, but she has fun with it regardless. 

I have just started her on King of Tokyo and she really enjoyed it, even though it's supposed to be 8+. She needed a little assistance obviously, but she liked the dice rolling, the art and the fact that she could keep hitting Daddy. Charming. 
Check out all [Marbushka](http://www.marbushka.com/) games

I was taught chess and monopoly jr when I was 4. Easy and cheap games to get started
I play Jenga, My First Carcassonne, and Monza every day with my 4 year old
Games my son played at 4 and enjoyed:

**Hoot, Owl, Hoot**

**Outfoxed**

**My First Carcassonne**

**The Little Orchard**
Three Little Pigs is good, our 3 and 6 year old like it.
I'll second the recommendations for My First Carcassone and Tsuro, my older daughter first played those games at four well as Blokus, Robot Turtles, Supertooth, Engineering Ants. I might need to check out some of these others ones people posted for her and my other daughter.
Rhino Hero, Dobble, Bugs in the Kitchen
I got **Rhino Hero** for my niece and she really likes it. I play it with her every time I go to visit. I don't have any experience with anything else. I got this after searching for the same type of threads. I think it was a good choice.
You have to keep in mind that whatever kids game you bring into the house, you should be prepared to play it over and over and over again. Of the ones we own, the one I don't mind playing is **Sequence for Kids**. It teaches taking turns, keeping a secret hand, making choices, and there is a spatial element. 
My nieces like a lot [Robot Turtles](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147370/robot-turtles) and we have been playing since they were 3 years old (they are now 6 and a half and we still play from time to time). It is a programming game where they have to move a turtle towars a gem giving instructions like move forward or turn 90 degrees. What's good about this game is that there are different more complex cards and elements in the board that you can start using once they learn the basics (boxes that can be pushed or ice towers that can be melted for example).

***Splendor***. Collect gems, color matching, simple counting, and pretty gems! Just play to 5 pts for attention span. Bonus of having a fun game to play with adults too.  
  
***Sleeping Queens***. Matching, counting, some simple math, kings, queens, dragons, sleeping potions, and knights! Fairly simple card mechanics and a great theme for Little girls.     
  
***Monster Factory***. Colorful, simple, *hilarious!*. Tile laying with color matching. Super fun, simple, and can play single player just trying to make a ludicrous monster!

Qwirkle, Blokus, Loopin Louie all do well with the 4 year old set. Sometimes have to modify a rule or two.
I play **King** **of** **Tokyo** with my 4 year old son, and he understands almost all of it.  I might have to explain 1 of the cards to him, but he understands what he is rolling and which dice would be best to keep.  
I can not recommend pick up sticks enough. 

My group loves it and my son (6 now) thoroughly crushes us all at it. His little fingers are so perfect for it, he gets sticks none of us ever could. 
I would definitely recommend Junk Art. It's a fantastic game and you don't even need to keep score if you don't want to. Most of the time when I play with people who have never played before we drop a lot of the scoring or additional rules and just play until someone's falls over. 

There are a lot of variant game modes too so there are multiple ways to play. I'm sure it would be a hit. 
Best game by far for a young girl is Sleeping Queens. Very easy to learn, has some very basic math. Great to help little ones learn basic addition. My kids love it.  It was created by a 6 yr old girl. 
**動物将棋 (Animal Shōgi)**.  It's a really simplified version of chess.
My kids enjoy Loopin Chewie, Animal Upon Animal, and a roll and move game called The Greatest Day Ever. There's not much to that last one, but if it teaches them to like board games, I can support that. 
I got my niece Hoot Owl Hoot when she was that age.  Because it's a co-op, it really did wonders for curing her of that whole "you have to let the kid win or she'll pitch a fit" thing that so many kids have.  When we win or lose as a family, she can accept losing much more graciously. 
My littlest girl will be 5 next month. 

I will second the recommendations for **Animal Upon Animal**, **Outfoxed** & **Rhino Hero**.

I would also offer a suggestion for **Dr. Eureka**. This is a visualization / dexterity game and can be found at Target even.

To mitigate the dexterity a bit for her, we play where my 4-yr-old can handle the components directly and can put them on the table which are not allowed for the older players. We don't really let her win, though.
Labyrinth
There's even a Labyrinth Jr but the original is just fine too.
My 5yr old (boy) enjoys Carcassonne, King of Tokyo, Magic Labyrinth, 12 Days, Roll For It, Las Vegas, No Thanks and has just started playing Splendor.

Having read all of the previous comments we're also going to get him Outfoxed and Animal Upon Animal for Xmas to go with Hey That's My Fish and Pitchcar that we've already bought him.
Give **Archipelago** a look for a fun thematic eurostyle game. **Zombicide:BP** and **Conan** (simple rules but bad rulebook) are great for not so serious fun with some great components. Maybe look up **Blood Rage** as well if you want some more competitive inis. **Last Will** also has a great theme that should keep people interested (should be cheaper than the other stuff I mentioned).
**Roll for the Galaxy** has a good space theme. The large amount of dice get others intrigued and the art is good. I've played it 3 times and already know all the rules and have taught it twice, both times took 10-15 mins to explain.
Easiest game i know with a bit of depth would be **coloretto**

If you dont mind Co-ops **Hanabi** has a lot of depth for a simple rule set.

**Concordia**'s rule book is 4 pages long i believe and is an amazing light-medium Euro. 

If you want to go even deeper, i have never had problems explaining **Power grid** to people. Though i guess this game looks as boring as any game i have ever seen. 


**Raiders of the North Sea**.  It looks very appealing (awesome component quality, has real coins, really brilliant artwork with vibrant colors), and it's a really good worker-placement game.  It's my favorite of the genre.

I would describe it as mid-weight but there are others who might describe it as light-weight; depends on your tastes.  Judging by the other games you listed I think it would probably be a good fit.
**Concordia** - just don't show them the box cover!

**Kemet** - Not that hard to explain but make sure everyone has a reference sheet of the power tiles.

**Above & Below** - looks gorgeous, but also has story element with the storybook, it is not all about the strategy.

**Lords of Waterdeep** - many non gamer friends enjoyed it, for more depth the expansion is a must.

**Tikal** - the new reprint coming out this december by super meeple, same publisher as Mexica re-print with the same great component quality.

**Evolution Climate** - great artwork, great gameplay, easy to teach and tons of depth.
**Lewis & Clark**  
**Rokoko**  
**Coal Baron**  
**Imperial Settlers**  
**Among the Stars**  
Junk Art and Imhotep are my go to's right now.  Junk's quality components are top notch and a breeze to teach.  Imhotep is just solid entry level good.  A bit on the drab side, but less is more here!
**Manhattan Project** is a very nice mid weight introduction to worker placement. **Castles of mad king ludwig** is another lighter mid weight game with interesting theme and components that attract new players. **Roll for the Galaxy** for those who want something a little heavier
Check out scythe. It looks interesting. The components are beautiful. The artwork is stunning. And it's mid weight strategy with some combat. I'm totally in love. 
Cry Havoc. If they think it looks boring, you need new friends lol
If you don't mind a TV licensed game then **Spartacus: A Game of Blood and Treachery** by Gale Force 9 might be worth checking out. You play as a Dominus (an owner of gladiators) and manage your "stable" of gladiators against others. You fight your gladiators in an arena, kill off your foes, recruit stronger gladiators, and generally try to screw your opponent. Check it out and see if it interests you. 
This is probably not exactly what you're looking for, but [Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146278/tash-kalar-arena-legends) is an abstract gladiator themed game. Yes, I know that sounds contradictory, lol. It kinda is spell slinging, but in a different way. Players have specialized decks of monsters that they summon into the board for a short period of time, and they're summoned by placing tokens that match the pattern on the cards.  The goal is to finish objectives though, the fights themselves are secondary.
You could have a look at the **Hoplomachus** Series
if you don't mind a more abstract game, you could try **Colossal Arena**. It's a card game where creatures are "battling" in, well, an arena. Every round players place combat cards on creatures and eventually one creature gets knocked out. Players are trying to place bets on the creatures that will survive until the end. I use the term *battling* loosely because it's very abstract. It is a good game with 4, and as a bonus, it's quite cheap!

Edit:  price has gone up for this game, not sure why. Could be out of print.
Spartacus Blood in the Sand is a lot of fun, it's more intrigue and back stabbing with a bit of gladiatorial fighting thrown in, but it's very thematic.
**Gorechosen** is a blast.  Who cares if it is warhammer, it's a bashfest and the minis look great
Have you looked into **Yashima: Legend of the Kami Masters**? It's got the brawling you might be jonesing for.

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163175/yashima-legend-kami-masters
Try **[Ultimate Warriorz](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100679/ultimate-warriorz)**
**Gladiatoris** is currently on Kickstarter, it seems it would fit your description. Give it a look: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/605706654/gladiatoris
I've enjoyed [Clash of the Gladiators](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3242/clash-gladiators) quite a bit. In the first half of the game you draft different members to your squads and then you have the squads go around fighting other squads or NPC animals until there's only 1 player left. I really like all of the different gladiator powers and they feel very thematic which enhances the experience nicely. 
**Duel of Ages II**

It's a wild team vs team combat game in a crazy, Hunger Games style arena.

Could be just what you're after.
I had been eyeing [Arena Rex](http://arenarex.com/) awhile ago. A bit of a cash sink initially but could be really cool if you have a group down for it. 
BattleCON is a beautiful fighting game. Modeled after the classic 2d fighting games like street fighter. Each player has a common set of base moves, then a set of styles unique to their character, as well as a unique ability. Each turn both players choose a move+style pair, then simultaneous reveal and resolve. Attack pairs have a 2 turn cool down. You always know exactly what your opponent has, and there are no dice. Half the game is understanding how to play each of the (largely really cool and unique) characters. The other half is anticipating your opponents moves and choosing accordingly. With perfect information you have nothing to blame for losing but yourself. I just acquired this game and fell in love. 

Not exactly gladiators, but it is 2 people (or 2v2, or a few other variants) beating the crap out of each other in an arena. 
If you want additional scheming, trading, partnering and betraying, try Spartacus.

If you want just a pure gladiatorial experience, look at Hoplomachus.

You're going to seriously have to work out the cost of shipping vs the cost of games. There is a line when you should re-buy your games for the same cost. If you're talking with a couple months to spare, sell your collection and treat it as an opportunity.
Check the maximum dimensions of checked baggage with your airline. Even paying for extra checked baggage is usually cheaper than shipping internationally. Get a "dish barrel" box from UHaul. They are double-walled and can be cut down to the proper dimensions. They are very strong boxes. Good luck. 

Unfortunately you're going to be paying for both weight and size. There's not much you can do about the first, but the second can be helped by eliminating as much empty space in your game boxes as possible. Like, stuffing socks and underwear around your dice and meeples kind of space management. Any stuff that would otherwise be going back home anyway, work it Tetris-style into your game box and sort it out once it arrives at the destination. 
I don't, but if you find out I'd love to know.   

I live in Japan and frequently have my family ship games to me.  From what we've found, the post office, expensive as it is, has given us the cheapest quotes thus far.   

If you find differently, please let me know.  
I'm in Malaysia and due to our currency being weak af. Games are too expensive when it used to be affordable. 
So I would like to know too. 

Best I can think of is if you have a pilot friend who flies frequently to America and to where you are.

I'm still hoping to find that friend. 
If you have a lot of stuff to send home, you could ask your new employer to pay for a shipping container to be shipped.  The down side is that it's very slow (it goes by sea) but you can send quite a lot of goods home in such a container.
My wife and I are giant **Alhambra** fans. We own and love the Big Box. 

Here's the thing: the expansions are definitely a mixed bag. Some of them, in our opinion, are essential (like *Diamonds* and *Currency Exchange*), but a lot of them are more *flavor* changes than mechanical necessities. Some are definitely better than others. We haven't encountered any that we think are unplayable or outright bad. Just different flavors.

Base **Alhambra** is a great game, but the expansions in the Big Box add *so much variety*. Keep something in mind, too: each numbered expansion actually consists of *four expansion modules* that can be mixed and matched at will, which actually means you're getting *twenty* expansions, not just five.

$16 for base **Alhambra** is a screaming deal. $63 for the Big Box is, IMO, worth every penny. It depends on whether you think you're going to play the base game and end up wanting expansions later, but you're not going wrong either way.
 Not all expansions are equal in Alhambra, but there is a lot to like in them once you get familiar with the base game.  I reviewed a few of them on my blog a few years back...

[]((https://steelaraza.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/daves-eurogame-calvinball-alhambra-and-its-expansions) 
You could try getting the app and playing that a few times. It's well implemented and would give you a feel whether you would get bored with the base game or not. It won't tell you if you'd like the expansions, but it will let you know about base a bit better. 

Personally I enjoy a number of the expansions and think the big box is a good idea.
My wife and I love Alhambra.  I think there is a lot of play in the base game before you get bored of it. 

I personally find the expansions uninteresting or a hinderence to play. Others love them.  The only one I keep in play is the magic buildings, but that is far from needed. 
I played Alhambra base a few times at a friend's place, then decided to buy the big box for myself. My verdict : you can play the base game without ever needing to have an expansion. 

That being said, I have no regrets buying the big box (got it for 50€ tho). 

Expansions interest depends on what you like (or don't). Each expensions have many variants and stuff. They are all mixable (even if playing all of them might not be such a good idea). All in all, I'd say that unless you're already a fan of the game, you can skip the expansions. 

Hope that helped :)
Thanks everyone for your insight! I'll hold out and hope I get the base game delivered but keep an eye out for a holiday sale involving the big box. Seems like either way you can't go wrong.
I would agree that starting with the base game would be a good idea since you don't even necessarily know that you'll love it. If you do, you will probably like certain aspects (tile-laying, financial/market, or whatever) then you can research and get expansion(s) that add on to that aspect. Also adding an expansion now and then will keep the game fresh and reduce the chances of being overwhelmed by so many expansions you can't decide which to use which sometimes happens. 
I dont know but i also want to know the answer
Play a practice game with the "My First Game" setup - President/Bomber, Blue Team/Red Team to make up the player count, Gambler if you've got an odd number of players. Play 3 rounds with 1 hostage per round. For each game after that, play with the full 5 rounds and appropriate number of transfers.

If people are comfortable with how the game plays, move on to "My First Color Share" - President/Bomber, Doctor/Engineer, Red and Blue Coy Boys, Negotiators and Spies, and again filling up numbers with vanilla Blue Team/Red Team/Gambler.

After that, you want to read the room a bit. If people are getting a bit meh with the whole Red/Blue thing and want there to be other factions, add some Grey roles - Sniper/Target/Decoy is a good three-card set, the pairs of Ahab/Moby, Romeo/Juliet, Maid/Butler and Wife/Mistress are all good for that too. If people want to have more scope for strategy, try the Red/Blue Ambassadors, Bouncers or Security are good, as are the ones connected with conditions like the Shy Guy, Coy Boys and Paranoid. Similarly, for the Greys there are the Private Investigator (requires you to teach about burying, so you'll probably want to add the back-up roles of President's Daughter, Nurse, Martyr and Tinker) and MI6. If people are getting into the fun of things and want a silly game, give them some acting roles like Mimes and Clowns, and the "I don't know what's going on" roles of Hot Potato and Leprechaun - or even Dr Boom and the Saturday Knight if you don't mind the chance the game could end 5 seconds in.
My friend used to teach this game quite frequently, one time with the designer in tow. We never did anything more basic than president, bomber, doctor, engineer and shy guys. Criminal and psychiatrist were often used in second game, followed by spies.
Look at the publishers website, they have example sets.
If you're going to go with anti-achievements (get assassin picked first turn) than I'd keep them as secret achievements. It would be pretty lame to create all these and someone just intentionally gives an obvious clue that leads to the assassin just for the chievo. 
Codenames:

*Four Score* give a four card clue and have your team mates guess all 4

Sheriff of Nottingham

*Master Smuggler* Sneek thru four contraband cards in one round
I feel a funny splendor game could involve one player with all the nobles. Perhaps more absurd would be all nobles and losing. Taken to the extreme, all 5 nobles in a 4 player game with no other points (exactly 15 needed to trigger the end of the game) and losing. But I think you'd have to cooperatively try to cause that to happen. 

Dominion-win with no treasurer in your deck (thieves were doing a number on one player. They were down to like 4 treasure but mostly gold and multiple adventurers got them to enough provinces to win.)

Dominion coop achievement-trash every curse. None in the supply or any decks.

Coup-win without looking at your cards  (maybe some sort of allowance to check when called bullshit on and must choose to exchange randomly next round if forced to look)  (I totally play like this after a couple drinks.)

I'm not creative enough for fancy names. I just like absurd board states. 
Some things fit the digital world and some the analog one.  This kind of thing sucks for analog gaming
Why? 


Is it just me, or does it seem like the offerings for boardgame Kickstarters are becoming increasingly saturated with garbage? Other than the well-established stalwarts like CMoN, Tiny Epic, et cetera, almost every campaign seems like crap. Often it feels like 60% of the campaigns are desperately trying to be EDGY and HIP and somehow end up as the second coming of Cards Against Humanity.
I think I'm actually going to pass on **Tiny Epic Quest**. The gameplay seems a little lack-luster, and things like fulfilling quests via positioning seems somewhat un-thematic. I also don't like that the game requires a huge amount of table space, which somewhat defeats the entire purpose of having a portable game which you can bring anywhere.

*EDIT: Why the downvotes? Are we not allowed to discuss the downsides to popular Kickstarters? Am I not appropriately contributing to the conversation?*
Backing [**Tiny Epic Quest**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coe/tiny-epic-quest-introducing-itemeeplestm/), my first Tiny Epic game. I wish they could have posted more updates during the campaign. This one was a "oh yeah, I am backing that one as well" every time I visited Kickstarter.

I have heard good things about this Tiny Epic series and while I did not back Galaxy, I will give this one a try.  Even if I don't end up enjoying the game, I will be able to use the Meeples in other games, using the gear to show them off a bit better.


[**Mythic Battles: Pantheon**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/806316071/mythic-battles-pantheon/description/) is still the campaign that I am enjoying the most. The amazing models (104 high quality models in the core pledge alone) and a great example on how to communicate with your backers and fans. Léonidas who is one of the designers of the game have done several live streams answering questions and talking about the game, features and much more. And Quirkworthy is in the comment section 12+ hours per day to answer questions as well. Great way of getting the community for your game off to a good start.


I shall see if I can get Quirkworthy or Léonidas to do an AMA here on /boardgames before the campaign for [Mythic Battles: Pantheon](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/806316071/mythic-battles-pantheon/description/) is over.
Yōkai Quest looks cool, I'm maxed out on miniature co-op games though.
The lolwuts are pretty lolwut this week... Anything looking good to anyone? I'm stoked for TEQ; Tiny Epic Western is amazing and it feels like these games just keep getting better.
Of these I have backed only two: **Tiny Epic Quest** (although I think they are making a rather big fuss about the meeples!). and **Legends Untold**


I'm interested in Shadowscape but i'm a bit concerned about the low amount of enemies. anyone else have any thoughts on this?
**Lisboa** looks great and I backed the retail version of **Feudum**, but I don't know if I will keep backing it, because the currently reveiled stretch goals seem very weird to me and the expansions seem to offer very little.
Just a quick correction. For Tricksters, those amounts listed are in Mexican pesos (MX$), not US dollars.
First time backing anything, but i have gone balls deep into Mythich Battles: Pantheon. Also Not entirely sure if i should bother with tiny epic quest or not.. I will probably keep it backed, just worried it wont be that fun maybe?
[Abandon Planet ](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/845031916/abandon-planet/?ref=kicktraq) is from the creator of The Resistance/Avalon.

I played this at PAX and this is the game I'm most excited about in 2017. Very backstabby/fun.
I had backed Mega Man Pixel Tactics and canceled my pledge. I figured if any type of game was going to blow through its stretch goals a mega man game would. So far they've got something like 6 of 20 unlocked...

It's actually making me not want it to know I won't get a full set of extra characters. I'd rather just increase my pledge 20 bucks and buy the full set as the stretch goals basically make a third set of cards. 
I really want to back **Me, Myself, and Ice Cream** just to put my dog in the game. 
Coffee & Dice Bournemouth will be the first non game I'm backing. 

Met them at Stabcon in Southampton recently and was blown away how good they were at teaching games. Not sure how often I'll make it down to the café but want to support them as it will be great for the community. 
I have no idea how it funded, but I'm really happy for that kid that created Sunship with his dad.
I hope you guys check out Doug Doug Goose Caboose. I'm super happy to be publishing it! It's great for conventions, work meetings with new people, game meetups, etc! 

The incredible Kwanchai did the art for it, so it's beautiful as well.

I'm happy to answer any questions!
I backed Tiny Epic Quest and [5-Minute Dungeon](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wiggles3d/5-minute-dungeon-the-most-fun-you-can-have-in-5-mi). Nothing else really stands out to me.
Yokai Quest all the way! :D
Really pleased that **The Forest Dragon** card game funded so quickly.

Seems like a fun little push-your-luck game, and great to be able to support the adventure that the two boys are having with their Dad. I'm looking forward to playing it with assorted neices and nephews and telling them how the game came into being - hopefully inspire another generation of designers and gamers. :D
**Mythic Battles: Pantheon** looks great and I'd have a blast painting it, but all the optional but exclusives are really turning me off.
Yokai Quest and Legends Untold both look really interesting, ill be keeping my eye on both of them.
Anyone else close to backing or actually backing **Legends Untold**? Looks like it could be a lot of fun.
Is it just me or is Social Lubrication one of the worst IDEAS for a game ever?
Hey, thanks for the mention!  Social Lubrication Card Game is #lolwut and is now 1% funded. Check out the video for fun but please do not play this game at work or with your family.
No idea on OtV, but Cosmic Encounter, Quantum, tiny epic galaxies would all look great on said mat.
OtV is good. The rule book can be improved but overall it plays well. It is often on sale at £11 in UK, though, so I personally think $30 is too high.
**Onward** does a few things that are really interesting. It is really thematic and the conflicts in the game can be really fun to go through but I've only really played it once at 2 players. I feel like that game would really shine with more. $30 seems like a decent price, I picked it up at $25 which is the price I see it normally at. 
I threw all mine in the trash
First edition is the better for me but i enjoyed the one versus many aspect and dislike apps. If you don't think you'll use it you could donate it to a game cafe as spares. 
I MUCH MUCH prefer 1st ed to 2nd ed. I moved mountains to buy a 1st edition core set and did archaelogy to find & buy the expansions. 

If you really don't need it, I suggest sell it. You'll get a very good price for people like me who are looking for it.

Yes you can. 

The rules say take from  "any colony"  not "any home world". 

It's very important to some of the races as well (amoeba comes to mind) 
What happens when player A gets to Attack player B. He points to a planet where player B has no ships, but player C has 1 ship over there.

Player B has (0) + attack cards in value. Right?
Does player C have to defend? (I don't think so, right?)

What happens?

Is there a player aid to explain this game better? I tried it several times now and I think it's pretty hard to explain while it's a fairly simple game. Just so many small rules. Haven't even tried explaining the flares and tech cards.
We always played it as you can pull from wherever (not the warp, obviously) to fill out offensive or defensive ally, so long as you leave 1 ship to maintain the colony. 
I'm not an expert on this since I've only been playing Cosmic for a few months now and some people have been playing for 30+years, but I've already had to teach a lot of people how to play because it instantly became my group's most popular game so I think my input is very valid here considering that I recently successfully did what you are going to do.

First, don't start with the rewards deck. Use it during your second or preferably third game, trust me, the game is still great without it and a lot of the cards in the rewards deck can be confusing even if you have a good understanding of the game already. (I'm looking at you, **Intimidates**.)

Second, I'd suggest using flares if you, as the game teacher, have a very confident understanding of the rules, interactions, and phases etc (we played our first game without them though since none of us had played before and it worked very well). I've found that if someone doesn't understand one they just don't use it.

Third, I'd highly recommend taking out the red aliens for your first game and possibly, depending on how much you want to micro-manage, curate down the remaining aliens to ones that you understand clearly and think will interact well while playing. There's so much stuff available in the game, it's fine to temporarily remove some of it as you see fit.

Fourth, I think possibly one of the most important parts of the game and also the most confusing aspect for new players is how the different phases work and interact. I'd recommend actually announcing each new phase as it appears for most of the first time around the table and showing players how to follow along at the bottom of their alien sheet.

Also, make it clear what the difference is between **rewards** and **compensation**!!! That shit is real confusing for the first 15-25 minutes.
Make sure that your group is ok with working together. Then make sure your group is ok (and doesn't hold any grudges) when they're stabbed in the back. If you find that group, this game is golden.

I would recommend playing without the optional cards, the aliens themselves can get confusing enough by themselves.
Great advice in this thread. I will give a more general rip, play the game multiple times before judging especially if everyone is new. The game kinda felt "meh" to me on my first game but after a few games it became my personal favorite. 

After a few games you can see a few things 1)various alien interactions 2) different "powerhouses" maybe I game 1 someone dominated but not game 2. 3) if everyone is new you will see some strategies emerge. Some players will grasp the game quicker (1-2 games). The first backstabbing will be remember and my group still discusses a particularly funny one. 

Go in with an open mind and have some fun.  Remember half the game isn't mechanics , it is the people interacting. Lie,bluff,barter,joke,betray,betray the person you betrayed the other person for then betray again. Etc 


Random things. Sometimes knowingly playing a negotiate into an attack of the right play. Some "bad ideas" are situationally very good. Don't play locust ever one of the few aliens that is just not good fun or interesting(most are though!) Remember some powers seem very strong(and likely are) but have restrictions. Leviathan lets you add 20 to you attacks, crazy right? But you can only do it on your turn while attacks. Some people can activate powers on defense or every turn. Keep that in mind (I prefer powers you can use often). 
Depends on the group, but I wouldn't add the defender deck in the first game. I have the hardest time explaining the cards in there to people sometimes. 

If you have all the time in the world, try it without flares, then with flares, then with the defender deck. Flares in if you just plan on one game.
Our first game we used only green aliens and we didn't bother using any technology cards. It was easy to pick up and still a ton of fun.
Use only the green aliens at first (those marked for begginers)
People may not understand that lying is a game mechanic, and may hold a grudge as a result.

I've seen people who get scared away due to the complexity when people try to introduce the game with flairs.

No one will understand the two conditions to getting a new hand no matter how much you explain, because they want a new hand and you're telling them they can't yet, so they won't listen to you (typically humans blocking out rules they don't like).  Give them a game or two and they'll get it :)

A good frame of mind is the more a player is engaged in the game, the better chance they have of winning, even if they have the worst hand in the world.


Lie. A lot.
If your only issue with **Marvel: Legendary** is that it's too easy to beat, you should DEFINITELY get Dark City. The two should kind of be sold together. The Guardians of the Galaxy expansion is also awesome because THANOS but after those two you should just choose based on what characters you like.
No need to expand **Catan** once it goes stale. This just means you are maturing as a board game player (most of us move past Catan at some point, though you can certainly be a hardcore gamer who loves Catan). More expansions won't make it much better.

I've heard **leaders** is excellent if you love 7 Wonders.

**Power Up** is a must.

Just out of curiosity, why do you want to expand those rather than look into new ones? What else is in your collection?


Carcassonne isn't truly complete until it has Inns and Cathedrals, and Traders and  Builders. Those two expansions add just enough to make the game better without really making it much more complex. I can't imagine playing without them at this point.
Cities and Knights makes Catan playable for me. That being said I will always vote to play something else.
Second cities and leaders for 7 Wonders

Cities is my favorite expansion for 7 Wonders. Some parts of it requires the Leaders expansion, but only because it comes with new leader cards. Otherwise, it works without other expansions. Not a huge fan of Leaders myself, since I feel it doesn't add much to the game besides having a thing that biases your decisions a little but it doesn't really hurt. Wonders Pack is a good one to get though. What I don't recommend, though, is the Babel expansion. Just adds a bit too much to keep track of and just more stuff more that clutters the table. 

For Carcassonne, I'd say that you're correct in your evaluation of the base game being near perfection, especially if you have the new Z-Man edition. I have the first two expansions and they're just okay. They add some potential for explosive plays, but that's about it. Still doesn't hurt to buy them though, and one of them comes with a bag to draw tiles out of, making setup and cleanup faster.

For Legendary: have you tried playing it competitively? I feel that co-op games tend to have a weaker lifespan than competitive games do because you only need to be better than the game for it to be over, whereas if you play against other players you may find it to be a lot of fun to continually try to outplay each other, which'll give it that extra breath of life that you want out of it.

Power Up is definitely worth it. With the base game of King of Tokyo on its own, monster selection feels pretty pointless because they all play the same exact way, but with Power Up, they each get their own unique powers, so that they're actually different. Then when you get bored of that, there's a drafting variant that lets players mix and match powers. If King of Tokyo in its base state is still fun for your group, though, I recommend holding off on the expansion until you notice it not hitting the table anymore.
**Leaders** is fantastic, also really like **Cities**
I'd suggest **Russia/Japan** for **Power Grid**, especially if you ever play three-player as both are excellent maps for that count due to their market or spacial narrowness.
I will say that I will almost never play **King of Tokyo** without the Power Up expansion. I like the unique powers that make choosing your character an important choice. It makes the game slightly less just pick up and play but it really makes each monster shine without relying on the market cards. 
Gotta say really not too much point to king of tokyo without power up
Absolutely. To pass the endeavour, **you only need to roll 1 success and avoid sinking** (see pg 10 in the rules). You take damage equal to the defense of the site (6 in this case) minus however many successes you rolled. With 5 dice, you're pretty much guaranteed to take some damage...but you might not sink.
 **Shadows** **of** **Brimstone** is kinda finicky but fits your requirements.  Other than that I think **Descent** would probably be the best jumping in point for what you are looking for.  Also, we have **Imperial** **Assault** app to look forward to release early next year.  
Sword and Sorcery, Gloomhaven, Massive Darkness. Those are the main ones people are looking forward to now.

My favourite currently is Galaxy Defenders, though I'm not sure it counts as a dungeon crawler!
Are you saying descent is too expensive? 

It's really not anymore than anything else would be and the new app for it is incredible. 

I highly recommend it. 
**Arcadia Quest** is a very fine pick since you don't need a dungeon master.
I would recommend the following for two player games that are fast paced:
7 Wonders Duel (designed for two players only)
Castles of Burgundy (don't be put off by the box/artwork, it's a joy to play)
Roll for the Galaxy (a little tricky to learn, but really fast and easy after that)
7 Wonders Duel is an awesome game and plays super quick.  I would definitely recommend it. 
The big book of madness is awesome 
A combination of board and card here for you so this may be extensive, though I'll hold it to my personal owned games to help...

Forbidden island/desert are coop games that play relatively quickly and are very enjoyable. 

Castle panic also plays quickly and enjoyably, though if you don't want strict coop munchkin panic has a versus setting. 

Coup is a very nice card game that plays quickly and scales well from 2+ players. Bluffing heavily involved. Comedy if you're like my friends "you're bluffing the duke! Oh my!!"

Mad science by cryptozooc is super super fun theme wise. Little longer to play and slightly more relaxed pace but it's like a 30-40 minute game play. Really fun.

Gentlemen Thieves is less well known but I really enjoy it. Basically you're thieves trying for the big score. Every round has a set of 2 thieves and a set of 3 thieves and you take turns setting the allies. So there's some strategy to that. As a location scores the winning set splits loot evenly (discard extras). When the constable is drawn the game ends and the thief who has the most loot wins. Fast paced and fun.

AEG doesn't seem to make a bad game at all ever and most of theirs are fun and fast paced. Among my favorites are smash up (lots of expansions available so really the game rarely ever plays the same way twice) and love letter (lots of thematic variants and they just put out a really nice expansion).

If you're into dice and deck building then dice masters is pretty fun and the starter packs are pretty cheap. Lots of fun options there thematicallly - D.C. Marvel faerun and more. 

Robot rally is nice in that they have different levels of difficulty and time options. Fast game va slow game is just a different page in the setup book. Preprogrammed moves in essentially a capture the flag race against opponents. It's great fun!

King of Tokyo is another great quick play game. Combination of skill and luck for a dice based game. Several expansions available. 

Dice games tend to be pretty quick but rarely vary. My favorites are back to the future and zombie dice. Zombie dice has a few expansions and variants. Added bonus, they're really compact and very easy to teach so they make great travel games!

Loony labs also makes great games and their customer service is second to none. Fluxx is my favorite. Simple, plays quickly, and they have a ton of different decks so pick your pony. Star, Monty python, batsman, firefly, oz, adventure time, monster, holiday... all with their own little quirks and differences! (Essentially, there are keepers creepers and goals. You win by matching goal criteria. These change as the game plays. Each deck has different themes on them and a different unique set of rule cards and actions to play. For example in Monty python fluxx there are bonuses for singing and accents). They also make a game called Loonacy which is like the traditional game of Speed but on crack. 4 piled to hunt instead of 2 and pictures instead of suits.  

Another game that is really fun is Splendor. Economic style gem grabbing and trading towards victory points. 

Libertalia is a fun pirate themed game where you play from the same deck of characters but set a different order to get treasures and avoid curses. Might be harder to play with 2 though.
Onitama is pretty great. Won't light your world on fire, but its pretty and a pleasant~ way to pass the time with someone you like.
**Race for the Galaxy** is our favorite for two. We've also recently picked up **Jaipur** and **Schotten-Totten**. All of them are fast once you both know what you're doing. If you're specifically looking for a faster-paced deckbuilder, take a look at **Ascension**.
Star Wars Destiny is just about to release on the 1st and it's pretty fast paced, though a collectible sales model.  2 starter packs would only set you back about $30 though.
If you want another deck-builder, try Ascension or something co-op like Legendary Encounters: Alien, or Attack on Titan or Shadowrun Crossfire.

I am not real sure exactly what the pacing thing is about, as I've not played either game you mention. But, for non-deckbuilders that we tend to play with minimal downtime, we like Beyond Baker Street, Jaipur, Patchwork, Eight-Minute Empire: Legends, Flick 'Em Up, Pandemic: The Cure... Many more I can't think of at the moment.
I'm really not sure what pacing you mean. Kingdom builder has much faster turns than Dominion. You can usually fully decide your turn while the other person goes.
[The Duke](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36235/duke)
We've found Five Tribes 2-player or Quadropolis is less than an hour. 
The entire Stonemaier games line is fast paced!

Euphoria, Scythe, Viticulture/Tuscany. Short turns, shorter games.
Lost Cities is pretty fast paced once you learn it. Plays in 15 minutes or so. I think it's got a nice balance of luck and strategy too but it's definitely a lighter game.
**Jaipur** and  **Guildhall** could be good choices.
The upcoming release from Renegade Games "Blood of an Englishman" is a fast paced asynchronous 2p card game. Basically one player plays as Jack (of Jack and the Beanstalk) and the other player acts as the Giant.

Jack is attempting to collect 3 sets of beanstalk cards in ascending order and finish them off with a treasure. The Giant is attempting to get the Fee Fi Fo Fum cards either all at the bottom of 5 stacks, or all together in one stack. Plays in about 15 minutes or so. Really fun game.
A few more fast 2p games:

Hive (15-20 minutes)

Star Realms (20-30 minutes)

Kahuna (30 minutes)

Medieval Academy (30 minutes)
I'd recommend mystic vale, check it out!


It sounds like you're asking for a game full of difficult decisions that players don't have to think about.
"Analysis Paralysis" tends to be more of a player issue than a game issue, but that said...

I'd say any of Mac Gerdts' games fit, especially those that use a rondel: Antike, Imperial, Navegador, etc. On your turn you take a single action from a subset of possible actions, and they tend to be fairly simple to execute. The trick is creating chains of actions to achieve your goals, and interspersing other actions to get overlapping chains that help you achieve your goals more efficiently than the other players.

Turns whip by because they are so concise, but the time between turns is enough (generally) for you to make sure you know what to do. In a lot of games, you get enough room on your turn to get a lot done. In Gerdts' games, you have to break your plans up across many turns, so everyone tends to move pretty quickly.
To be fair to OP, some are definitely worse than others.  I think more strategic, "multiplayer solitaire" games are your best options.  You pick a general start and that makes picking amongst the large number easier.  It's likely that only a few of those available will be the objective best. That and other players won't throw too many wrenches into the mix.

I think that's why a game like Agricola tends to be easier than something like 5 Tribes even though the former is heavier than the latter.
I would say technically any euro could fall into this category, as AP is definitely player based, and even games that you'd not think induce AP can in fact induce AP.

That being said, in my experience **Vinhos Deluxe Edition** is one of the fastest playing heavy games I own. Teaching this game is a beast with all the little actions, but it plays buttery smooth. While it might not be AP-free, I breeze through a two player game in an hour, and the longest a four player has taken me is 2hr 15m. 

I've yet to have a chance to play it, but I'd imagine Lacerda's **The Gallerist** would be a similar case.
No. I've seen someone AP in **Carcassonne** FFS!
There are people who regularly get AP from Love Letter.  You are blaming the wrong thing ;)
I would look for a game that mitigates the AP instead of alleviating it. Games with simultaneous selection can funnel the most involved decisions into these simultaneous moments so everyone can refine their plan while waiting for the most AP player.

**Food Chain Magnate** is an example of a game like this.
Pretty much any game can be over analyzed by people depending on the circumstances. No game is going to magically have all players instantly knowing their best move unless it plays itself which would be a really shitty game. On the flipside of that, no Euro games really trip me up but combat/conflict heavy games bog the hell down for me. AP comes down to the individual player, their mood, their taste, and a ton of other factors.
Terraforming Mars is pretty good for this since a lot the moments when there could be AP are done simultaneously such as when you're getting new cards, and actual turns move pretty quickly. It's a bit more of a medium weight game though.

I find Food Chain Magnate to be similar, the most AP part of choosing which employees to play is done simultaneously, actually doing your turn and using your employees shouldn't take as long since you should've already decided how to use them, though others players actions may have affected how you were going to play them.
It really depends on how much interactivity there is between players. If another player's turn doesn't have an impact on your turn, you should be planning out your turn in advance. 
**Scythe** seems to handle this pretty well since the moment a player picks an action then the next player can essentially go (unless if they picked movement).  Now it won't fix AP because players will still need to decide on what to do, but it will cut down on your downtime.
Mombasa has very quick turns because everyone basically already picked what they were doing in the planning phase
Definitely the player's fault but it can be helped by playing games that allow players to think about their turns during other peoples' turns or implementing a house rule that allows this but doesn't affect the game itself in any meaningful way, like the house rule in Carcassonne where you draw your tile at the end of your turn instead of at the start of it.
I'd say the available actions for Terra Mystica are fairly simple. You might end up with a slow first turn in a round as everyone figures out their plan for the round.
Timing Cubes help more than game selection. It's truly time blindness, not being slow jerks who know it for most people.

That said, Roads and Boats is pretty decent at being pretty quick for the depth. I think people give up on a total understanding of that one pretty quickly, and know they're making do. 


So what *breaks* AP is randomness. So heavy war games tend to have less AP than heavy Euros. It put a horizon on the timelines that people are going over in their heads. 

I personally find super long train games eventually wear down over-analyzers, and become a "us against time" fight.  1854/1844 is a  candidate there for instance. 1889 if you're looking for shorter. 18OE if you're just plain looking for "Frenzied play it as fast as you can because YO, we don't have all day, literally"


**Galaxy Trucker**

Oddly enough, our AP player loves it.
It's not the game that induces AP, it's the player that falls into AP.
People really need to stop using short forms without explaining them first. I was like "Wait... what... Action Points?". And no, it was not obvious, and no, it's not a commonly used abbreviation.

And as someone allready mentioned. It's a player thing, not the games fault. Atleast most of the time. And the heavier the game the worse the issue. It's contradictive, a game beeing fast-paced is not really a thing for heavier games. It's like shooting yourself in the foot and hoping it won't hurt.

I guess a euro where players take their turns simultaneously would be a good start.
I'm not sure I'd call it heavy, but I've never seen an AP issue with Puerto Rico. 
Just picked up **Code Names** and it came with a sand timer that looks to be 1m24s... there's your solution for Analysis Paralysis!
Not **Terra Mystica** or **Scythe**
I am the lucky (and proud) owner of this table and would definitely recommend f0rkstab and his dad's work.  The table looks even better in real life and it is expertly built.  You can tell they really took the care and extra time it takes to make a beautiful product.  His dad said "we want to do everything right and not cut any corners" and you can really tell with the finished product.

Thank you f0rkstab and f0rkstab's dad!
Fantastic work. Well done!
Love it. I've wanted to build my own for so long. How much were the materials for this and how long did it take you guys to build it?

Also, how much would it cost to buy one of these from you? You're probably much better at wood working than I am :)
I want one so much every time I see something like this... um... though not at the moment while I consider moving.  I'd love a huge dining room one, and then I'd add some custom painted bits... 
Looks beautiful!
Very cool.  Do you guys make a pretty standard design or do you make them with different options or custom for each person? 

I've been interested in getting one but none of the ones I've seen for sale have everything I want.  If you are near me for pickup and would be willing to customize a bit for a reasonable price I'm interested.  
So... want to make one and ship it to me
Really great job
Do you think you could show a picture of how you did the drawers? Maybe just a shot of what the table looks like from underneath. I am early on in building my own games table and having trouble planning out the drawers.
Nice job!  Can I ask, how did you come to arrive at your final dimensions?  What height did you finally decide to make the table, and how did that affect your leg room? 
very nice looking
Great job!
The first one is **Basari**.
I got the name of the German one it's Die Mangier von Pangea
thanks for the help everyone!
[deleted]
**Quantum**

Give **Galaxy Trucker** a look. It's probably something you never played before but it pretty much covers all the points. Plus, it's a wonderful game.
**Star Wars Rebellion** maybe worth a try.
I'd say Forbidden Stars (better get it before goes out of print). Star Trek: Fleet Captains is good as well, plays well with 2p, and has a strong exploration aspect to it, but it's a bit more head-to-head. Star Wars: Rebellion is VERY competitive, so I don't know about it.
**Xia** is probably what you are looking for... though I'm not sure how great it is with 2.

But If a bit of logistical puzzle solving and space travel based on the reality of our space race is of interest, I'd highly recommend checking out **Leaving Earth** 

Of the two I think leaving earth is better, but xia has more mainstream appeal

EDIT: if a space battle game for 2 is what you are looking for **Space Empires:4x** could be what you are after.

It plays 2-4 players. Best at 2, but 4 ffa or teams is possible and with 3 players use alternate victory conditions. 

It has fog of war, tech trees, exploration, And plenty of battles. 

It doesn't look like much, and small cardboard chits is a throwback to old school wargaming. But rules wise it is not difficult and I'm not sure how you would do fog of war any other way.
Obvious answer is **twilight emperium**.  Just kidding...or am I?!

I enjoy **Star Trek: Panic**...but there's no exploration there.  

Try up some **Xia: Legends of a Drift System** only I don't know how that would do with 2.
How about the expansions for eclipse, makes it much better as a two player game.
Does he like the Star Trek IP?  If so, **Star Trek: Ascendancy** fits this niche and while it technically is a 3 player game plays fine at 2.
I'm holding my breath for **A handful of Stars** that will hopefully be available for pre-order soon
Empires of the Void.
If you are not repelled by the anime theme [Tragedy Looper](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148319/tragedy-looper)
is the game looking for. There is a evil mastermind (GM) and there are different plots with different stories and if you finish them the GM can make his own stories or you can get expansions. The players are time travelers that are trying to solve the murder that will happen in a known time but the killer and where the murder will happen is unknown. And if they fail to stop it they can try again but they have limited retries. Hope this helps :)
**Mysterium** and **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** would be right up your alley.

in Mysterium, one player controls a ghost(GM) who has to give clues to the other detectives to help figure out who killed him, where he got killed, and what weapon was used. However, the ghosts can only interact with the detectives by using vague pictures to help hint on the answer. The game is purely co-operative, and everone wins when the detectives figure out all the answers. The Art is stunningly beautiful and the mood is easy to settle in the group. That said, the game is highly dependent on who you play with, and is not for everyone.

Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, is another deductive reasoning game, but has a betrayer mechanic. One person plays the Forensic scientist (GM), One person plays the Murderer, and the rest will be playing as Investigators. Depending on the number of players, an Accomplice and a Witness will be added among the players. The Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. So not only do the investigators have to figure out the truth, the murderer makes that harder by adding in some lies and makes discord in the discussion.

Overall, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong would be the better choice, as a wider variety of people can play and enjoy it compared to Mysterium. Not to say that Mysterium is a bad game, its fun when it clicks, but the experience is highly dependent on the imaginations of the ghost player, and what the Detectives can infer from it.
Requires no DM, and it's less of a board game and more of an RPG, but **Fiasco** can definitely accomplish this.  Also if you'd like to write the campaign, **Dread** also can do this as well (I literally just played a Five Nights At Freddy's mystery scenario a friend created a couple of weeks ago).
**Mansions of Madness** is maybe something you'd like. There's a 2nd edition out, where the GM role is handled by a tablet app, but the  1st edition is kind of what you're suggesting.

It's 2-5 players, with one player as a "Keeper", who sets up the scenario, including clues to the mystery found in specific rooms, hidden behind puzzles. The other players are investigators, coming to figure out the mystery.

Caveats include it being Lovecraftian, with the included monsters and insanity this usually entails, a pretty involved setup (hence the 2nd edition, where it's all handled by an app) and a bit of rule jankiness in certain scenarios. Something you may read about the game is limited playability due to only 5 scenarios, but each of those scenarios have a bunch of different setups, so the game is good for hundreds of plays, way more than you'd ever need.
Definitely check out **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** and **Tragedy Looper**. One is quick and party-ish, the other is longer and possibly more in line with what you are after. I prefer the former since it supports more people and it's just easier, but love them both.
Tragedy Looper
The general term for this kind of game is a "parlor larp"
Yes fiasco.

You might enjoy the leverage rpg book. It's based off the tv series and has tons of little mini adventures for RP. 

Let me think on it and see if I'm finding more that aren't already being mentioned.

There's an old series of games set for just this. They're in a box murder mystery party nights where you host a dinner party or something. Everyone gets an invite and a character and works together to solve the mystery. Though dated they are still awesome. They were released by Bepuzzled and many are on eBay for $10 or so.

Escape the room has a series of games as well. One is sold at target. They're made by Thinkfun. 

I will echo fiasco. That game is ridiculously fun and very very flexible.

Dinnerandamurder.com sells several of these style games but they're non very cheap and I've never played them so can't guarantee their worth.
**Spyfall** would be perfect for this, especially considering you can just use your phones.  It's a social deduction game where 1 player is trying to figure out where all of the other players are at.

Also along the same lines as **CAH** I would suggest **FunEmployed**, and **Stipulations**.
Codenames is always a good time and great when you mainly want to socialize!
**Love Letter** or **Love Letter Premium Edition**  The game is really simple and i've had endles fun for an extremely cheap and portable game. The standard game is only 4 player, but the premium edition is about 2.5x more expensive, but comes with an expansion to make it go up to 8 players
I always enjoy playing Lords of Waterdeep during roadtrips...
Anomia, you can fit a couple of decks in a deck box. Bang or Bang The Dice Game. Sushi Go. Car Wars The Card Game. I believe Codenames will fit in a deck box or 2 as well. 
**Fluxx**, **Exploding Kittens**, **Skull**

**Red 7** if you think they would like something with a bit more thinking
there's quite a few. from Heroes&Monster collections:

**Seer Kel** from *Stewards of the Secret*

**Challara** and **Lyssa** from *Bonds of the Wild*

**Zyla** from *Treaty of Champions*

**Astarra** from *Crusade of the Forgotten*

and two from expansions:

**Ravaella Lightfoot** from *Shadow of Nerekhall*

**Dezra** from *Labyrinth of Ruin*
[Check the wiki here](http://descent2e.wikia.com/wiki/Hero). Maybe [Astarra](http://descent2e.wikia.com/wiki/Astarra) from the [Crusade of the Forgotten pack](http://descent2e.wikia.com/wiki/Crusade_of_the_Forgotten).
Look into Spyfall, Dixit, Cash N Guns, Lifeboats, and Bang! 
You should definetly try "codenames", its a really fun word relation game, I can assure you, one of the best casual games out there. Other than that try werewolf, easy to print and play and very simmilar to avalon, if you liked that.
Would definitely recommend **Codenames**. Good party game and game be played in 20-30 minutes and setup is super simple. For a co-op game, **Pandemic** is probably my favorite. Takes about an 60 minutes to play, and setup is pretty simple.
Grifters. Set in the same universe as Coup and The Resistance, and it is around the $20 price point.

Beyond Baker Street. It's like Hanabi, but has theme and is said to work better at 2 players, and supports up to 4 players. I love it.

Bang! The Dice Game. Pretty fun, if you have enough people.

Eight-Minute Empire: Legends. It's a fast and simple area control game. I love it.

Deception: Murder in Hong Kong. This is my game of choice, whenever possible, I would play it. Even over The Resistance, which previously was my favorite game. I don't know the price in the US, but it's $35 Canadian. Worth every cent to me.

Diamant. A push-your-luck cave exploration game. Very simple to teach and play. The newest version from IELLO is great.

The Game

No Thanks!

For Sale
**Sushi Go Party!**  
**Bohnanza**  
**6 nimmt!**  
All three games are rather light and small but offer a lot of replayablity and are very cheap.

The Resistance, King of Tokyo (slightly more than 20), Pandemic
**For Sale** could be right up your alley.  It's a card game with auctioning mechanics where players try essentially flip houses for a profit.  to It's very easy to learn and can take only about 10 minutes if everyone knows what they're doing.  Best with 5 players but is well balanced and can easily play with 3-6 players.  
Rumble in the dungeon is fun. It's pretty cheap and has about a 15 minute play time, but you normally play 4-5 rounds 

Truro is a fun game for 2-8 players it has 10 minute rounds, but you normally play a bunch of rounds 

Celestia is a very different and fun game for 2-5 players. It takes about 45 minutes to play. It's a push your luck game.

Diplomacy is a very long board game for 2-6 players. It is all about relationships with other countries during a war. It takes 4 or more hours to play



Avalon set it off for me, too. **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** is what I suggest you get next.
I am going to ignore all your requirements and suggest Cosmic Encounter. Avalon and Cosmic are my groups 2 favorite games. I don't know that I would suggest Cosmic with 6 but with 4-5 it's golden. Cosmic has replayability through the roof.
If you're looking to buy 3-5 board games as you've stated, I would probably not make them all co-op/team party games. There's a large variety of games out there to explore. Someone else mentioned **Cosmic Encounter**, which is another great social game for larger groups. **San Juan** is a good intro into the euro style engine builder type of games. You work to build the best plantation by building buildings with special powers or that support your crops to get more points. **Istanbul** is a great game where you deploy workers to visit different buildings and gain abilities to get you gems and points. **Pandemic** is a really popular co-op game with a central map where everyone is trying to contain & cure disease outbreaks all over the world. It's super fun but works better with 2 or 3 people. **Between Two Cities** is a semi co-op which works for larger groups. You work with the person to your left and right to build 2 separate cities with your & their tiles. There are always 2 winners in the game and you want to be one of them.
Strongly recommend you get **Carcassonne** at some point. Plays 5 players (can play 6 with an expansion). Simple to learn but with plenty of depth. It was the first game I got and 40ish games later it is still my favourite!
Anomia, Sushi Go, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Car Wars card game, Dixit or Mysterium, Codenames, Bang The Dice Game, then there are standards like Dominion, Carcassonne, 7 Wonders, Catan, Ticket To Ride (some may require expansions to play with 5-6)
Absolutely get Pandemic. It "plays" 4, but you are all together so having 6 around the table is no problem at all. It's my favorite game, especially for newcomers, and even now with hundreds in my collection. Plus, it's like $25 on Amazon (Target will price match!)
A $20 limit doesn't give you much choice, especially at that player count. You might consider upping the price a bit if you want something a bit more complex.

**Secret Hitler** would work, although it is pretty similar to Avalon, maybe a bit too similar. The premise is 1 player is secretly Hitler, 1 or more players are fascists looking to get Hitler made Chancellor (the Hitler player doesn't know who they are though) and the rest are liberals looking to prevent this and pass their own policies.

**Dead Last** is also similar. It's kind of like survivor where over multiple rounds, players vote each other off, but you're trying to vote for the same person as the majority do. If you vote for someone other than the one who gets eliminated, you're also eliminated, so you're trying to send tells to people about who to vote for and whatnot. You can't be too obvious though, because if someone realizes they're going to get voted off, they can play a card which allows them to force someone else off instead.

**For Sale** is much different. It's a real estate game with 2 phases. In the first phase, you're buying various properties, and in the 2nd phase, you're selling them off.
3d printed catan board & pieces. Seen that a lot in thingiverse. And generally any custom 3d printed stuff for boardgames. if painting miniatures is considered custom design than that too.
I made the custom Jaipur set using poker chips that was on here in the past. It's boss to play with the heavier chips.
Some people have posted REALLY blinged out versions of T'Zolkin. Painted wheels, gear and the like. Really intricate work, and the results are beautiful.
Flag Dash, don't own it myself but I have seen some positive reviews.
Wiz-War is like capture the flag with magical combat
You can play CTF with RoboRally, but you could be in for a long game.
Stratego
The Duke has flags in it for a capture the flag style game. 
**Confusion** is a cold war themed game in which you try to get a briefcase and bring it across the enemy border. It sounds a bit like capture the flag, but there is only one, it's in the middle of the map, etc.
**Chaosmos** may be worth checking out.  

The winner of the game is the player who is holding the "Ovoid" card when the game ends, but you don't know where it is when the game starts.  It's got an interesting mix of deduction, bluffing, and combat.
Hey OP, sometimes we get hyper focused on hot modern board games and we forget the most obvious answer. Stratego is capture the flag: the board game, literally. It's never talked about on here and has a low rating, so watch a video before you buy, but it's the most correct answer to your question. It's also a classic. But it can get old fast

Memoir 44
The expansion for Doom (2004) has a ctf mode. 
My first thought was **Chaosmos**, which has already been mentioned.

There's also **Zimby Mojo**, a "co-opportunistic" game of shamanistic tribes trying to usurp the king's throne and become the new king. The first phase is a cooperative game of breaking into his fortress, and the second half is a competitive free-for-all game of trying to carry the king's crown back to your base, much like capture the flag. Haven't played it, but it sounded interesting and so it's on my wish list.
We've played a great Capture the Flag variant of **RoboRally**. Even the standard **RoboRally** rules have a CTF/race feel.
I really enjoy the WOW minis game for an area control board game that has a capture the flag feel.

**Keyflower** has meeples of different colors (4) and they can't be mixed (usually) so when someone uses or bids on a particular tile using, say, yellow meeples all bids from other players must also use yellow.

**Colonia** has multiple currencies and, IIRC, certain items can only be bought with one or another. There are conversion rates too, I think... It's been a while and I never suggested we play the game a second time.

**Alhambra** has multiple currencies too but, like **Keyflower**, doesn't really have a conversion rate (unless one was introduced in one of its many expansions).
You might check out the voyages of Marco Polo. There's only 1 type of money but you are constantly converting resources from one type to another to have just the right amount for your goals. Between camals, goods, and coins, you will be managing all three as currency throughout the game. 
It might not *quite* hit the mark. But do take a look at **Stockpile**. You trade in various company stocks that always go up or down each turn. ("trade" is perhaps a bit too generous a word. You bid for piles of stocks, and you choose when to sell the stocks, you cannot actually trade stocks with the other players). The expansion also adds a bunch of modules to the game, one of which is a commodity system that works differently than the stocks. Though, sadly I cannot remember how. Still, it does add more types of "currencies" to the game :)
Have you played Puerto Rico? It's not multiple currencies as such but it does have cash, victory points, and multiple resources. 

You use both cash and resources to get victory points and the resources also give you cash, the cash also improves production. The different resources have fixed cash value but the actual value to the individual changes depending on how you play and importantly how the other players do. 

From my understanding of what you want it loosely fits. Plus it is an awesome game and everyone should give it a go.

**Core Worlds** has five currencies (and happens to be one of my favorite games). There are actions, energy, ground strength, air strength, and faction tokens. 

Actions and energy are spent to perform tasks in the game. Very nearly everything you do costs both of them and a huge part of the game is efficient use of these two resources. Most things will cost one action and an amount of energy that generally ranges from 1-9. Everyone gets the same number of actions at the beginning of each round and energy is generated by planets you've conquered. You start with 3 per round and I've seen as high as mid 30's on the last turn. Normally it's around 20. 

Ground and air strength are provided buy combat units you have deployed (deploying costing actions and energy) and are spent to conquer planets from the "market". Each unit typically provides a combined 2-10 strength but in the late game there are some that can go beyond that. The planets require anywhere from 1-14ish combined air and ground. To clarify, each unit has a specific value of each it provides (with abilities that can modify the values by spending actions or energy when they invade) and each planet requires a specific amount of ground and a specific amount of air. 

Factions tokens are introduced in the first expansion (which most people consider required) and are gained when you deploy a unit your purchased earlier. None of the starter cards provide tokens. The factions score by majorities at the end of the game but you can also spend the tokens during play for effects that vary based on the faction. 

TL;DR: Core Worlds has 5 currencies and revolves heavily around the efficient spending of them to conquer the most valuable planets. 
Have you tried **Acquire**?  Very interesting tile laying game designed by the genius Sid Sackson in the 60s.  Still holds up very well today.  You get to invest in companies and stage takeovers.  Lots of fun, I'd recommend 4 players but goes from 3-6.
Just to preface I've played CCGs competitively for 15 years:

1.  Learning curve is rather low for picking up the basics.  If your group can play Magic you should be fine.  A lot of the strategy has to do with the assignment of your Warlord with the dials.

2.  There is an alignment wheel that limits what factions can be in the same deck.  Towards the end of my time playing I was able to build mono-faction decks that were relatively balanced with each otehr.
3.  A lot of the fun co
mes from the expansions.  My gut feeling is just with the Core set(a single core set does not have a full playset of everything, lots of singletons and pairs) and both deluxe expansions that the Tyranids would be significantly stronger than the other factions, likely same is true with Necrons.  You also would not have much variety with just those 3 boxes either, the mini expansions introduce new warlords which is where a lot of the variation comes from.  

All this said the game is very fun, I think you might be better of getting a core set or two and an entire set (FFG called them cycles) of expansions.

Be aware that it's basically a finished game. If there's any new releases it'll just be a couple before it's done. Good thing with a LCG though is that it's reasonable to own everything.
Conquest was my introduction yo card games. I was a long time 40k fan so when a friend came home with conquest and Forbidden stars I was hooked. I would highly recomend conquest. It does however have a steep learning curve in my opinion. Once someone in your group learns how to manipulate the planets in yheir favor they will have a massive advantage. Id recomend the first 2 cycles. The last cycle was solid but deep strike will never be fleshed out. 
This is a great game with some really fun mechanics and a lot of faction variety in the base box.  Sounds like your group would be perfect for it, yes.
If you're interested in Roll for the Galaxy, and are looking for a 2 player game, I'd suggest you look into Race for the Galaxy instead.  They're very similar games, but Race's 2 player variant is the best way to play it, whereas Roll's variant is pretty lacklustre.  
Roll for the Galaxy and 7 Wonders Duel are both excellent with two players. Roll is in my opinion better than Race, and clearly some people will tell you the opposite.... however, I would suggest Roll purely because the dice mechanic feels different to other good two player games, many of which are card based.

I would also suggest looking at Imperial Settlers or Guilds of London given your likes
Roll is great in my opinion, but my wife is more lukewarm on it. She loves Viticulture, though. Have you considered that?
**Maderia** is great game as well as **7 wonders duel**, while I didn't like **Terra Mystica** with 2 players. Can't remember about **Porto Rico** with 2 (I think there are some special/additional rules maybe?), while The **Gallerist** and **Tzolk'in** I have, but haven't played yet.  
Other then those games I'll suggest few other (in my opinion) really good titles with 2 that you can play under 2 hours:    
**Shakespeare**  
**Snowdonia**  
**Lewis & Clark**  
**Seasons**  
**Suburbia**  
**CO2**  
**Trajan**


I say get tzolkin and Roll. Phenomenal games that hit all your requirements
It sounds like my tastes are similar to yours. I'd recommend **Trajan** and **Terra Mystica** (my wife and I love it as a two player game, even though I know many who do not).

For an inexpensive change of pace, check out **The Ravens of Thri Sahashri**. We love that one, too. Very deep but quick and inexpensive.
**Agricola**

**Lewis & Clark**

**Seasons**

**Race for the Galaxy**

**Above & Below**
I suggest the following for two players:

Roll for the Galaxy: love this game and works well with two players. I enjoy looking at what my wife is currently doing and anticipating what she might do so I can get two actions instead of one. 

7 Wonders Duel: great "filler" game that can be played in about 20 mins. Better this for 2 players then regular 7 Wonders I would say. It's great as a quick game between games or even to take somewhere (we took it to the pool with the kids swimming lessons). 

T'Zolkien: great with two players, you randomly block other spaces if you have less then 4 but we both really enjoy it. 

The Gallerist: fantastic game that I just love, but my wife is meh about it based on the theme. Works just great two players, it's a giant puzzle really, no luck in this game but it's sooo satisfying to play. 

Orleans: another game I really love that the wife is meh about. It's great with two players as it is with 4. 



Games I wouldn't recommend for 2:

Idle of Skye:  it's a nice like Carcasonne like game but the bidding mechanism loses a lot with only two players. Great with 3-4 though. 

New York 1901: great simple game with 3-4 players because it makes the board really tight and you can really block effectively. I can't imagine it would be good with two players because the board would be so open it would just feel dull. 

Terra Mystica: it's a fantastic game that I honestly don't enjoy with two players. The boards are so big that unless you intentionally build next to each other there is not much going on. Really needs 3 but preferably 4 players. 

I would also like to suggest:

Fields of Arle: a fantastic 2 player Uwe Rosenberg game in the feel of Agricola or Caverna. Lots of choices, no luck. There can be blocking in the actions but usually both players are doing different things. This is our go to 2 player game when we want something "meaty". So enjoyable, we both love it although you never feel like you are directly competing against each other but instead trying to do better then you did last time. 

Hope this helps!
Isle of skye, tzolkin, puerto rick, madeira and terra mystica aren't great with 2 i think.  

Gallerist, great Western trail islebound and new York 1901 i don't know. 

Roll for the galaxy, Orleans and 7 wonders:duel are solid choices.  I guess you can get all 3 for 100. 

Seems like your taste is pretty standard euro fair which does well on BGG so you can just search there to research your games I'd say.  I guess you're looking for some more personal info on why to get what but i wouldn't really know which out of hundreds of euros you'd like instead of the others.  

The games you sold and games you love look pretty similar to me with only the fact that you don't like complexity too much it seems (which would remove terra mystica and especially madeira from your list).

I think a BGG search for topgames for 2 players,  with a complexity between 2 and 3.5 and playtime under 90 mins should show you potential games.  Istanbul,  imperial settlers, st. Petersburg and notre dame might be other games you like.  

But for better help you should say why you didn't like some games and why you love your favourites
Roll for the galaxy is like a 15 minute filler game, especially with 2. Most Euros are going to play under 2 hours with 2 players....

From your list, I'd suggest Tzolkin, Orleans or Puerto Rico if you're looking for a full ledge board game you can play in under two hours with lots of interesting decisions to make as you go along. 
Bit of a snowball if players aren't on an equal level or if dice favor a particular player but I enjoy it even if I lose. 
I have had my eye on this game, but haven't gotten a chance to play it yet. I would love to hear you (or others) elaborate more on what you did/did not like about it. 
Played it before but never with 2 players.  I cannot imagine it being a fun 2 player game though because of its take-that mechanics.  Unless if you played with an alternate version where you are playing with all 4 dragons in a 2v2.
1. Take it back to the store, explain the problem and ask for an exchange.  Then, open the new copy in front of the customer service rep and check it.  You know what to look for, so there shouldn't be a problem easily spotting the same issue.  Failing that...  
2. Take it back to the store for a refund.  Invest a few dollars more and order Sushi Go Party! instead.  You may not have it for Thanksgiving, but you'll have the same core game with a plethora of options, and I would think less of a chance of the same manufacturing error.  
  
But that's me.
My version of sushi go party, the two stacks of cards which it came with, had different colours.. The game is not really effected by it any how.
My copy is the same. It doesn't affect gameplay. Taking it back to the store isn't worth the hassle. Likely the next copy you buy will be the same and you just wasted time.
Right now, the store wouldn't really be able to provide a foolproof solution. The upside is that it is an instant-ish exchange. (A previous post is right-- Do check on the spot if you can.)

What i would do is take pictures that show the difference, and email Gamewright. This is foolproof but you have to wait anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on where they ship replacements from. Just use what you have while waiting. 

All the best!
You need to look at the code on the back of your Sushi Go tin. There will either be a "V" or an "M" (last letter above the barcode).  It's important to match them up when you buy the soy sauce promo because there were two different print runs of the game.
Its meant to be a very casual, highly random roll-and-move.  It doesn't need fixing. 
Incorporate the board game portion of the current Smash Brothers game.  That would be a welcome addition.
I hear the latest installment actually does fix things a little - rather than having a single path, you roll dice to move around an island, picking up teammates and powerups before you face off against Bowser. So you have to work out how best to use your dice rolls to wind up on the spots you want to either get stuff or deny them to your opponents.
Last time I played Mario Party, there was a car that carried everyone around a board together. Is there still a car? Please, get rid of the car...
Does 40k count? If not then since Carcassonne came my way in 2007. Took my copy on honeymoon, it went round the world with us. Played it on the train through the Gobi desert. 
Last year! Wife thought it would be a good idea to get Pandemic (she's in a medical field so the theme was exciting) Now we have a very strong collection of heavy Euros for us and lighter fare for family and friends.
About two and half years. I somehow stumbled into this sub and thought it was pretty cool that there were so many board games out there. Literally the next day Amazon had one of the better sales I've ever seen on games. I picked up three or four games that looked interesting. You know the rest of the story, I now have a closet so full of games that I'll need to add more shelves soon.
About 4 years since I tried Catan and I bought Wits & Wagers. Soon afterward I bought Munchkin and then Discworld: Ankh-Morpork. That was it, until I played Pandemic in March of this year. Now I own over 150 games.
Starting Summer last year!
First played Catan in high school (97 or 98), but didn't really get involved with "modern" games until around 2001 with my university's gaming club. That makes 15 years! My tastes and approach to games has changed a lot in that time... and seeing the "2 years" responses makes me feel like an old man of the hobby. :-/
15 years. Played a travel edition of Catan in high school band class, caught the bug, and haven't looked back. For reference, back then the biggest designer games other than Catan were Carcassonne and Tigris & Euphrates. 
2007 started with Cavan and Arkham Horror in college. My first buy was Commands and colors ancients
Hello, my name is DHR and I'm a board game addict.

Oh, not that kind of thread....

I'd say 6 years...I don't want to think about how much money that is...
I was introduced to Catan and Bang in the summer of 2008...got my own copy of Catan on Boxing Day of that same year, and that started the madness. I'm probably going to be hitting game number 150 this Christmas.
Since about 2007. **Catan**, **Carcassonne**, and a couple of others hooked me. And then I found LCGs and economic euros and I was done for.
I had been playing Game of the Thrones the Board Game for a couple of years with friends until I happened to come across something last fall that pushed down this rabbit hole. I've slowed down my purchases but between KS and retail I'm around 50 games. At first I went a little crazy because there was so much to get and everything looked cool. Then I started to figure out what I liked and not to fall for every cool looking KS and my spending for a couple months there was unbalanced. 
Since about 2000/1.
Probably three major stages in my life - 

1993 - my older brother brings home heroquest and we become obsessed. 

1995 - magic the gathering introduces us to ccgs which we continue with, me particularly focusing on Magic, legend of the 5 rings, and vs system. 

2009 - I play settlers of catan and ticket to ride. I fall down the rabbit hole. Now I run a review blog and podcast and own ~100 games

About 25 years.

One of the first I played was **Eurorails**, which came out in 1990. 

Also played a lot of **WizWar** and **Trumpet** around that time. **Modern Art** and **Master Labyrinth**.

Then **RoboRally** in 1994, and **Settlers of Catan**, and **Medici** in 1995.

Then the field exploded, and by 1997, we were playing **El Grande**, **Tigris and Euphrates**, **Samurai**, **Bohnanza**, **Fluxx**, **Ursuppe**, **The Great Dalmuti**, **Kill Dr Lucky**, and **Give Me the Brain**.

And so it goes.
I think around 15 years ago when I got Zombies!!! for Christmas. Well, or technically a few years more with Magic and Pokemon.
2 years ago i played Catan at a friends house. Half a year later i decided to get some myself and discovered r/boardgames and bgg.  
  
Bought Castles of Burgundy, Avalon, Dominion, Carcassonne, and Love Letter. Got Pandemic and Cosmic Encounter 6-8 months later. Planning to make a new purchase in the near future, just got to make a good decision because it will be my last purchase for a good while to limit myself.
I played a lot of **Risk** and **Axis & Allies** and **Shogun** in the 80's, but those don't necessarily count in most people's minds. Not sure if **M:tG** in '93 or **RoboRally** around '95 count, either. So, it would've been when we started playing **Settlers of Catan** in 1998, followed closely by **Ra** and **Carcassonne**.
About 15 years now. We pulled out a friends copy of Electronic Dream Phone as a joke at her birthday one time and within a month we were playing Ra. I still don't remember where the copy of Ra came from and neither does she. But here we are, more than a decade and thousands of wonderful games later. 

May the golden age shine on forever.
Longer than the phrase "modern board games" has been in use.
5 years.  Started with Catan, Dominion, and Carcassone.  Can't get a more stereotypical story than that!
About a month and a half. Went to a games night at a friends and we played Captain Sonar and One Night Ultimate Werewolf and I have fallen for the hobby hard. I'd never realised board games other than different themes monopoly and cluedo existed. Bought Ticket to Ride, my own copy of ONUW and dead panic for Halloween (we haven't played a full game yet, kind of regret it) I've ploughed through all of Tabletop (which I know is polarising here but it's a brilliant gateway so thank you u/wil because I get to come home from a stressful ass job and unwind and learn about games I can put in my must get list. How good) Today I backed my first Kickstarter (Tiny epic quest) I go to my "local" board game cafe held every second Sunday as often as I can manage. Next week I'm going to the nearest city's board game festival. All day playing new (to me) board games! My family have been given a wish list of games if they are stumped for Christmas presents and I'm already having to limit myself to a single game purchase on payday each month. Or I'll be in financial ruin and have no space in my tiny box home to move. I am so happy right now
I've been playing modern board games since 2013 when my friend invited me to a game board day at the library. First games I played were Pandemic and Ticket to Ride. Then Castle Panic and Takenoko. I immediately bought CP and Takenoko plus Small World, Stone Age and Seasons. It's been down hill since then. 😊 now I own 77 games counting expansions. 
I played Catan a bunch in high school, just about ten years ago, and Bang a few times in college, but I didn't really get into the hobby in earnest until late 2012, when I started going to meetups. I pretty much jumped right I to the deep end, playing stuff like Vanuatu, Seasons, and Urban Sprawl in my very first meetup or two. I remember also playing Sid Sackson's Bazaar and Escape the Cursed Temple around then too. Good times. 
I've been playing board games just about every weekend since I was 13 or 14 (we started on settlers, RISK, ticket to ride), so thats err... 18 years or so! 
It is now about 4 years since I really got into the hobby. Played a few modern games during the 3 years prior to that, but they were just a novelty thing that I sometimes did at parties at the time. And before that I ended up more into tabletop RPGs and pretty much knew next to nothing about board games outside of the classics. 
I'm 43. Can't remember a time where there wasn't gaming of some type in my life, but I suppose this "modern round" kicked up in 2007 or so. 
As a backer, myself, I am really excited about this game, and I hope this revamp of the gials get people excited about the unlocks enough to make them back, as well. 
I keep looking at this saying "man, this looks neat, and I've heard PT is a great game, and I like MegaMan" as a nostalgic holdover from my childhood and all that, but I also have 2p games that aren't getting to the table *now* (like BattleCon). I'm not sure where this would fit into the collection as a result. Second, it's a cross between unfortunate and amusing that they tried to hold the extra content hostage and it didn't really work in terms of driving backers.  

This made me realize I need a 2p game day...
It's not available anywhere yet. It was only sent to the printer last week. It'll be a couple months before it starts shipping.
Kickstarter hasn't even shipped yet. It will be available via the designers site down the road. He only sells direct. 

FWIW the kickstarter was 18$ so it's not a huge price difference.
So far Tim has not sold much outside of his website for any of his games.  That's your best bet for now.
KS fulfillment has been delayed until January, I think, so following Tim Fowers's website is your best bet. 
Have you played mansions 2e? I own every expansion for Eldritch Horror, Mansions of Madness 2e, and I just picked up Arkham Horror LCG and played it this weekend. AH is neat because it's persistent, so your character actually grows from campaign to campaign, but boy was the last scenario brutal. 

If you like narrative, pick up MoM. At first I scoffed at the price and thought I didn't need another lovecraft game, but it's so good. I love Eldritch to death, but the story/narrative is much tighter in Mansions and the app makes the game so smooth and fun. 

That being said have you tried playing Eldritch where you each control 2 characters? The other tip would be to not be afraid of dying, and kill those monsters, and close gates before it gets out of hand. I played a 4p game last night of it with a new player and we fought Azathoth and won with 4 left on the doom tracker. Then again, I have all the expansions mixed in which might change how many hard or easy mythos cards that go in the deck. 
Pandemic Legacy 
Seconding playing EH with 2 characters each. Fortune and Gllry might work, or A Touch of Evil, though it's city rather than globe trotting.
We play Eldritch 2P, and only play 1 character each. It is brutal, but we do still manage to win probably half of the time. A lot of it is in choosing which characters are best against the old one you're battling, and making sure they complement each other. Also, don't be afraid of characters dying. Instead try to plan it so your new character can start near where the dead/insane character is so you can pick up their cards easily.

If you like the story and characters of Eldritch, the new Arkham Horror Card Game would be great for you too. 
They could be good fodder for **Concept** prompt cards. 

Likewise, you could use them as an impromptu **Codelines** grid - though, you'd have to proxy the rest of the components. Note that you can use the phone app to generate a grid card for the spymasters.
Could probably use them with Telestrations, if the words on the cards are stuff you can draw. It can be played without buying it if you have pen and paper. 
A game about puns?

You could burn them to keep warm this winter.
You could play Cyrano with them. In Cyrano, players are (collectively) given a theme card and two word-ending cards (-ing, -ode, -est), and with this information must compose a four-line poem: two rhyming couplets, one for each given word ending, on the given theme.

You could make up some word-ending cards yourself, and use a pair of Punderdome cards as the theme. To ensure a more entertaining theme than a random draw might generate, you could deal each player a hand of cards and take turns selecting a pair. Or just use single cards, whatever works for you.

Another idea would be to deal everyone a pair of cards and use them as prompts for Telestrations.
They also need the expansions. 
I got mine from Essen and noticed the same error. However, I didn't get any stickers. So this must have been brought to their attention afterwards. I'm going to contact CGE for a replacement.

Two of the Seals are wrong. Mine were the yellow/blue ribbon, which had the opposite color its other side. Kind of confusing. I'm guessing you get stickers to stick over those with the opposite coloring. It's on the face-down side, so shouldn't be noticable by other players (I hope)
I think it has more to do with Apple than Humble Bundle. I am sure HB would give you codes and stuff to get the games on iOS but Apple needs to work with HB to make it possible.  
You could always pick up the humble bundle and then download an Android emulator. They have them for Windows 10 computers and tablets. That can help you with your fix. 

But because of the way that iOS works you probably won't see any bundles for it. 
Apple doesn't want anything like Humble, so they will never support it

Best bet, go on Twitter and search for: **#AppSale** to find what's cheap

@Suzanne425 is always on top of those
Usually when they need your help finding a game, they're gateway gamers. Hobby gamers who does medium to heavier games don't need your help because they already research this stuff themselves.
My general rule (primarily at meet ups) is to ask people what their favorite game is. If they say Exploding Kittens, it's a very different experience level than someone who says Pandemic, or Chicago Express, or Churchill.
"Me: Oh great! So do you guys like thematic games, or do you look for mechanics and how the game plays?"

No, the first question, no matter who they are, or their level of experience, is "so, what games do you like". 
"I usually nail the hammer on the nail" what? Colonial version of "hit the nail on the head"?
Unless they have a beard. Rule of thumb: beards are hardcore. 
I'm confused. You say you saw them "grabbing every game I suggested." So they bought those games?

So they liked them? What's the problem here?
Ask them the last three games they've played and work from there. If they can't name them or haven't played that much, you can get a good idea of where they are at. If they can at least describe some of the components or what they did you can help them.
Good take away lesson


I was chatting with a new co-worker once and someone had mentioned how into board games I am, so the new co-worker is gushing about how much she loves board games to. I ask her what her favorite one is, hoping for a kindred spirit. She takes several beats to consider, then declares Monopoly. I ask, "Oh yeah, where you put money on Free Parking." She says, "of course." I finish up the small talk nicely enough, while internally laughing about how even perceived "nerd culture" has posers now.


On the flip side I asked for a specific game from a FLGS clerk one-time cause I couldn't find it on the shelves, they didn't have it. I said it was to bad, cause I figured my BF would have enjoyed it. The clerk takes this as a hint that I was looking for gateway stuff and starts to rattle off a list of games. I waved the clerk off while laughing, stating that I was a regular gamer and already knew all that stuff.
I'm worried about getting rules wrong. Finding out you've been playing something very wrong can ruin a game session for me and my friends.
A relatively fair review.

I am a little concerned about:

"The rulebook itself is not terribly written, but it is finicky, and we've found even the starting rules hard to keep in our brains this many games in."

Not terribly far in, but the starting rules were very  more repetitive than difficult. They are a bit long though.

Personally, I recommend having one person (the best "rules"  person of the group) read the rule book and everyone else should just watch through the how to play video until they need to look something up.
Quite a good review.

>Somehow the game has been shackled to the misconception that it’s strictly a thinky eurogame. 

I'd love to know how that got started.
>  What SeaFall's detractors miss, in my opinion, is the very point of the game. Somehow the game has been shackled to the misconception that it’s strictly a thinky eurogame. In reality, despite the fact that you collect and sell colored cubes representing goods, it's anything but. SeaFall is a grand exercise in communal storytelling, a shared journey into the baroque.

I don't know where the author gets this from. The Dice Tower, SU&SD, and others have all complained specifically that the story and legacy aspects were too slow and uninteresting, and that the game itself wasn't good enough to carry the experience. The author seems to ignore the first half of the complaint to dismiss the second, but the first part is essential. If reviewers felt the legacy parts of Seafall were strong, then I'm sure it would have gotten a positive review.
The first few games are fun, then you start adding shit and it goes downhill quick.  To be fair I only played it during playtest but it doesn't look like it changed much.  It starts fun but then the game just can't maintain..
I hate these reviews that basically say that other reviewers got it wrong. Each their opinion,  so far most reviews i read are very negative and this review also feels like a bunch of negatives "but we love it anyway". 

I'll be skipping this game,  and probably this reviewer too.
I pre-ordered it but haven't played yet. It's hard to tell how much of the critiques are because it was so hotly anticipated. Like, is it a decent game that just didn't deliver on how amazing people expected? Are we just mad to learn that Rob Daviau is a mere mortal?
Are there any spoilers in this review? I haven't read the comments here yet or the article as I'm a bit nervous. Only 3 games in at this point but I'm curious what this review says.
too bad the game cost almost three time more expensive in my country thanks to shipping cost and import tax. 

would love to play it.
Here you go: [Tiny Epic Western Rules - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3AuMyvCHVj7UVRPcC1PbEl0RFE/view)

Found it buried in the comments on BGG.
Anyone played it? I almost backed it, wondering if it would be worth picking up

As a Canadian I cry at these prices. 
I'm pretty new to the hobby. Is 30% off good? I mean obviously it's better than paying full price but I don't know how often board games go on sale or for how much discount. With Black Friday coming up soon I'm not sure if I should pull the trigger or just wait a bit longer.
Do you think this is going to be best major sale before christmas?
If I bought Codenames at Target like 3 days ago for full price, do you think they'll refund me the difference?
Usa only 
Sweet! Picked up Codenames for $10 with free shipping.  Good deal. Better price than even Amazon or Coolstuff offer.
Is this sale happening in physical Target locations or only online?
It looks like Amazon is pretty close to matching most of these prices today (beating some). Also I was able to find some sold out items at the same reduced price on Amazon.


If you have Prime check out Amazon before you buy.
Picked up castles of mad king ludwig, five tribes, and 7 wonders. 
Five Tribes for a little over $25 is a really good deal.
Thanks a lot you jerks. I just spent $60 on stuff I don't need.

I got Mastermind, Forbidden Island, King of Tokyo, and Carscaronne. Well, was it hard not to just file things like pandemic and dominion and stuff in my shopping cart I have a hard time getting any games to the table as it is.
Nice! Snagged TTR Europe for $23 with the discount, 5% using my red card, and doing store pickup.
Thanks for the heads up! Just ordered (Store Pickup for 2 of these) Pandemic, Codenames (for my cousin), and Five Tribes. $22.50 saved on games that were on my Wishlist. 
Thanks for posting; I grabbed Codenames for $10.70 w/tax. Shipping was free by the way if anyone else was wondering.
Is this online only, or does it also apply in the store?

I need a better warning for this type of shit target. You rat bastard. 
Is there anyway to get a price match online. I want them to match amazons suburbia. Base pricr of 65$ is stupid. 
I just picked up:


Pandemic 

Five Tribes 

Castles of Mad King Ludwig 

7 Wonders 

Dominion 

Carcassonne



Make sure you use your Target redcard for another 5% off.  You can use it even with online purchase + delivery.
I just got klask for $34 with in store pick up!
Currently trying to get them to price match Pandemic Legacy to either Amazon or Walmart, but since they're showing the List price in comparison to the real price, they think it's on sale and are refusing to price match. Any advice?
I didn't see Nordic Countries on their website?
On the BGG thread someone mentioned filtering by ''Brand'' aka publisher, rather then categories. Many more viable games show up.

i.e. Pandemic: On the Brink $16.80
I'm pretty new to the hobby (current collection includes Carcassonne, Jaipur, and Forbidden Island). So far in my cart:

Pandemic

Catan

Ticket to Ride

Lost Cities


Dominion

Any other essentials I should pick up (nothing too heavy because of the group I play with :/) I was thinking Love Letter could be good for about $5. 



Was about to shell out $45 for Ticket to Ride Europe last weekend. Thank goodness I decided to pick up Epic Spell Wars instead, that way I can take advantage of these sweet deals.
Hows tokaido?
Do they ship to the Netherlands?
felt like I was going to ordering 1 or 2 games, turns out it's 'store only'
Just tried this in-store.  They would not price match their own website AND honor the 30% off. 
Great find OP, got Fluxx, Love Letter, and Codenames.
Blood Rage is in there
7 Wonders is $20? Jesus, I overpaid for that game like hell
I just picked up **Mice & Mystics** for $43 with the red card.

I just bought it yesterday on Amazon for $58. Luckily, because I picked slow shipping, I was able to cancel that order.
Picked up Sheriff of Nottingham and Catan expansion!
Thanks! Just nabbed Camel Up and Lift It for $40 shipped. Also wanted Ticket to Ride Junior and Magic Labyrinth but shipping wasn't available :/
Picked up **Lift It! Deluxe** and **Tsuro of the Seas**
*In the US.
Just picked up Pandemic, Codenames, The Resistance, and Sheriff of Nottingham for 56 bucks. Awesome. Can't wait for the holidays now. 
Will Amazon run similar discounts on Black Friday?
Nice. Picked up three games for the kids for Christmas.
I was travelling yesterday and didn't see this. I'm very sad now :(
Why can I not find Five Tribes? Perhaps it's sold out.  Was it an online only offer?  I'm hoping to pick something up to play today.  Leaning toward Sheriff of Nottingham instead.
Just snagged Concordia Salsa for $25, that's a great deal!
Anyone try this out at Essen? The way dice are used seems very cool.
I was not aware of this game until now. 
Looks really good. Thanks!
About to continue watching the extended video - the game's looking very good thus far.
That box art though...jeez, and people complain about Inis.
Well, currently a new copy of small world is under twenty five bucks (for another hour at target with code PLAY, possibly a couple hours longer on Amazon) if that helps you make a decision. You could always sell your current copy with broken box for a little cash and come away with a perfect collection worthy copy then for barely nothing.

But you might just look for any box only eBay sales because small world uses the basic square sized box, you could paint it up and just slide the inserts in.

ETA - you could also contact the publisher, they often break open retail copies for replacement parts and boxes are the least requested.
Just go to the dollar store or a container store and get a cheap box that will hold it. If the label is still intact, paste that on the outside. Some people do this intentionally to their whole collections to save space.
If you're interested in building a new box, I'll link a helpful thread from a few weeks ago.

https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4iz4l0/diy_graphicswrapped_chipboard_card_game_boxes/
https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5669h8/my_custom_box_project/
If you love the game, I would buy a new copy, it's not that expensive
I think if the components didn't come damaged it isn't a candidate for the worst insert ever. 
Hey! CV doesn't get enough love, I really enjoy the game for something pretty fast and light.

I don't really think the insert it comes with is that bad though tbh. It obviously doesn't compare to what you've created but at least it keeps everything half separated without a bunch of zip lock bags to open every time you want to play.

Yours is awesome!
Very nice insert! How does CV play with 2 players?
I see from that close up of the dice picture that you used the cut two laters and overlap the final cardboard technique. Very nice.

I'm interested in how you get a good right angle because that's my major concern when I tried to make an insert I get paranoid that my angles aren't right and I ended up with a square base that wasn't exactly square.
Reminds me of the **Outfoxed** box. That thing could be cut in half.
You can fit everything except the rules and the board in a rather small Really Useful Box. 
It's really American to give games a box which is way too big. 

Machi Koro is a great example. The Japanese expansions come in a small tuckbox, slightly bigger than the cards themselves. The USA version fits a small car. 
To be honest if your husband isn't huge into the hobby yet I would personally skip most of the games you are interested in.  **Gloom** doesn't offer up that much replayability, especially at 2 players.  **Warhammer TCG** is solid, and if you like that I would also suggest **Blue Moon Legends**, **Lord of the Rings: LCG** or even the new **Arkham Horror: LCG**.  **Eldritch Horror** is not that bad as long as one player knows the rules, but just be warned that it's a game with a lot of moving pieces, it'll actually work perfectly fine as long as YOU are committed to understanding the game.  And I would also consider **Runebound** in the same pool of games as **EH**, but with a slight nod towards how *Mage Knight** is.

If you are looking for 2 player games with what you are looking for I would personally suggest (bare in mind that I'm keeping your husband in mind in terms of difficulty):

* **Pathfinder: Adventure Card Game**
* **Lord of the Rings: The Card Game** (already suggested above)
* **Arkham Horror: The Card Game* (already suggested above)
* **Blue Moon Legends** (already suggested above)

Also if budget is an issue I would highly suggest checking out these 2 player games since they are great options to have when you only have 30 minutes or under to play, and want to spend under $20 for a game:

* **Onitama**
* **Patchwork**
* **Mr. Jack** (or almost any of the Mr. Jack games)
* **Lost Cities**

Edit:  Oops forgot to mention your interest in **Dead of Winter**.  For 2 players I would DEFINITELY skip that one.  I personally wouldn't even play that game until you have at least 4 players.  Plus the rules are surprisingly a bit heavier than what you would expect.  It's still a solid game, but not a great choice for your situation.
I would stay away from **Dead of Winter**, it doesn't play well with two. I do enjoy **Eldritch Horror** with two though. 
Fantasy Flight is having a holiday sale and their games are ridiculously cheap right now. Go to their website site and pick up a five games instead of two.
That's what I just did.
My girlfriend and I love to play **Eldritch Horror** together, so o definitely recommend that one.  Though it is recommended you get one of the small expansions to go along with it so that you have enough encounter cards to keep things fresh.
Of those I would go with eldritch horror. Don't let the rule ion intimidate you - mechanics are relatively straight forward. Plays well with 2 and scales well with more.

Gloom needs the right crowd. If you play it at face value it's a pretty boring game. If you play with a group of storytellers or rpg fans it comes alive in the stories told across the table. It's not as fun with 2 either. 

Dead of winter is a love-hate. If you haven't played it before I would suggest playing a few rounds with a game store demo. It's much harder with only 2, it can be complex if you don't game a lot, and it tends to be polarizing bc of sabotage and secret missions. If you don't want to end up angry with each other make sure you have the right temperament to play. I love it. My fiancé hates it. So it sits on our shelf.

A similar theme to dead of winter that is significantly less polarizing is zombicide and the Black Plague expansion. It's quite fun! 
Oh! If you're looking for cheap and fun for 2 players with replay factor then AEG does no make a bad game.

Smash up and it's zillion expansions are always really fun. Love letter is a quick playing classic that we love to play with lots of thematic variants (batsman, LotR, etc). Mai Star is really fun too! 

Fluxx is fun a has a lot of different themed decks and promo cards and it rarely ever plays the same way. Loony Labs makes great games and their customer service is out of this world!!

If you like bluffing games, Coup is nice and can be played with 2+, though be careful not to burn yourself out on it. 

A lot of these may be cheap enough that you can buy a big game from your list and a few of these card games and have more options to work with too! :) 
Throwing my advice too, that Eldritch Horror is great with 2. You can each control two characters or more, as desired.

Since you're more experienced with board games, you can handle the housekeeping, which makes it more manageable for people with less experience, like your husband.


Gotta do the obligatory plug for **Twilight Struggle**, the game that was made to be played repeatedly against the same opponent, though I guess the jury's out on how convoluted it is, personally I think it's pretty simple, but I was also the kid who read the Magic comprehensive rules in his spare time so.

Of the ones on your list, I'd say **Eldritch Horror** with the caveat that I haven't played it, but am a huge fan of its predecesor **Arkham Horror**, and that's an infinitely replayable romp that works great with two (albeit with each player running two characters) and always leads to interesting stories, so I can only assume Eldritch is similar.
I'm still not sure I've found a boardgame that is fairly big and plays repeat value between 2+ players.

The ones I've found immense value for money are:-

* **Onitama** (2-player)
* **Codenames** (ideally 4 player+)

I guess if you're looking for theme, **Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective** might do also?
Oh!! How could I forget Fortunes and Glory! It's pure Ameritrust glory with so many pieces!! You can play coop against the Nazis OR the mob OR both, you can play player versus player while also dealing with Nazis mob etc, or for larger scale you can play teams. Different characters have different stats and abilities. The theme is awesome - it's very Indiana jones meets the Nazis. Don't let the piece count intimidate you - the mechanics are simple. It's good dice and strategy and so far it has played differently every time bc you can pick who to battle and what to include and which characters you use. It can even be played solo!
If you have limited funds and can't buy anything else for a while then stay away from any collectible games like Warhammer TCG. I haven't played that one but generally you need to buy a fair few expansions to make the deckbuilding interesting.

Eldritch Horror is one of my favorite games and plays well with 2 if you control 2 investigators each. However, I would say you need the first small box expansion, Forsaken Lore, as there aren't enough cards in the base game, you will quickly start coming across the same cards. The first expansion just adds a lot of much needed replayability to the base game.
Battleship Galactica is one of the best examples of this, and the game stands on its own if you don't know anything about the theme.
**Dune** (the original IP-based-games-can-actually-be-good example) or it's implementation under another IP: **Rex: Final Days of an Empire**

Both use an existing IP, but Rex’s IP is based on another board game :) 
Spartacus, Sons of Anarchy, Homeland, Legendary Encounters: Alien/Predator, WWE Showdown, Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, Uncharted, Gears of War, Doom.
* **Pillars of the Earth**

Not really hidden gems, but still very good IP:

* **Star Wars - Imperial Assault**. It's Star Wars adventures in a box. And the skirmish mode is pretty good too.
* **Conan**. Maybe a strech, but the gameplay is solid and the game is very faithful to the original stories by Robert E. Howard.
I come from the Euro zone, where existing IP's aren't used as a basis for the theme very often... but one that sticks out in my head is the Stefan Feld game **The Name Of The Rose**, based on the Umberto  Eco novel of the same name. It's a wonderful game, based on a really good [novel](https://www.amazon.com/Name-Rose-Umberto-Eco/dp/0544176561/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) (and a pretty good [movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091605/)). 


**Game of Thrones the Board Game** is the only game I've played based on a previous IP so far but it has universal acclaim (with a few caveats). It is an awesome board game adaptation that captures the feel and spirit of the IP. 
I see nobody mentioned **XCOM: The Game** so I'm tossing that in.

And of course **Firefly:  The Game**
For me: **Mechs vs Minions**, **Star Trek: Ascendancy**, **Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**, **Mythos Tale**, **A Study of Emerald**.
Is there a reason xcom isn't named? I haven't personally played it but I have heard nothing but good things 
Not exactly hidden, but pretty much all the GW FFG games were pretty good (Well, except Talisman and Space Talisman, but even those were alright for dicking around with friends).
I'm not sure how hidden it is, but the Spartacus board game from Gale Force 9 is shockingly good considering the IP it's based on. 
Fantasy Flight has several good Star Wars games.  **Rebellion**, **Armada**, **X-Wing**, **Imperial Assault**, and their RPG lines are all excellent.  I'm not big on the LCG, though, and **Destiny** hasn't been released yet.

**Battlestar Galactica** deserves a mention here.

**Game of Thrones: The Board Game** and **Game of Thrones: The Card Game 2nd Edition** are both great interpretations of GRRM's universe.  

**Sons of Anarchy** is surprisingly good.

While it's not deep, **WWE Superstar Showdown** is incredibly good at capturing the theme and making for a very fun quick game.  I actually think this is one of the best game designs I've ever seen and it's a shame that it didn't catch on really big as I would have loved to see more expansions and wrestlers for it.
War of the Ring
Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle
Buffy the Vampire Slayer 
Cthulhu Wars
Star Trek Fleet Captains

I just found out my father owns a copy of the Xanth board game, based on the series of novels by Piers Anthony. I have no idea what it plays like but I'm going to dig through the rulebook and report back.
Battlestar Galactica was surprisingly good. Before that one, I said IP = shitty game
There are tons of good games based on existing IPs. Just off the top of my head...

**Star Wars: Imperial Assault**

**Star Wars: Rebellion**

**Gears of War**

**Starcraft**

**Mansions of Madness**
There are quite a few acclaimed star wars games out there
**Scythe** The best part about it is the beautiful art and setting developed by the artist and licensed by Stonemaier Games.

My personal choice would be **A Game of Thrones LCG 2.0**. It's my favorite game of all time, super thematic and respectful of the source material and characters, and just a great game all around.
**Gears of War**  Hard to find now though as it's been out of print for a while.  
The big box with the 7 and 8th players has come and gone.  Considering the new version of Carcassonne with new art is still relatively new and they haven't done many of the expansions yet it could be some time before we see another big box edition.  Asmodee's acquisition of F2Z which includes Z-Man could shake things up as well.
I bought the big box last year right before they went out of stock at Amazon (before the $50+ price hike).  I was lucky.  Wish they still sold expansions with the old art though.  My gf and I really want the Princess & the Dragon one.  :(
Nice. Where did you get the foam from?

Personally, I prefer Imperial Assault.

IA has two game modes (an "rpg in a box" campaign storytelling mode, where 1 to 4 players play the Rebels against an Empire player, and a competitive skirmish mode that is usually 1v1 PvP but has some maps that can be played 2v2 or 1v4). 

In campaign mode, you are saving the galaxy, playing little known characters (and occasionally getting help from Han, Leia, Luke, R2D2, C3PO, Chewie, Lando). Most games for my group took between an hour and two hours (most stories in the campaign are timed). 

In skirmish mode, you have a mission with some objective, and you are trying to get the most points by completing the objective and destroying the other player... in other words, a pretty typical minis game. Competitive play is timed to about an hour, and where in the campaign, you are trying to build an effective team with equipment and skill buffs with your #player team, in skirmish, you are building teams with a set point limit (so your team could be as small as 3 or 4 figures or very very large) and a set of buff cards that you draw from that let you do things you couldn't normally do.


Rebellion is a 1v1 game (though you can split it into 2v2 if you want). It takes many hours to play. It is far more asymmetrical than IA - starting out, it is very easy for the empire to expand their fleet and army, and difficult for the rebellion to do so (and difficult for the rebellion to fulfill missions). It just didn't work for me.
I personally would rather play **Rebellion**, but **Imperial Assault** is a bit more easier to get to the table with the rules and game length.  Plus there are a ton of expansions already out for **IA** so if you guys love it and play it a ton, then you have plenty of options to go with from there.
I really like both but they are very different. I think you'll get more variability out of **Imperial Assault** since it has two distinct modes of play, each of which has a lot of variety. You are likely going to end up spending more on it, long term, however, since you're probably going to want to get at least some of the expansions.

**Rebellion** is also a great game, and there's certainly room in a collection for both. Other than the IP, the two have almost nothing in common except that each has a fair amount of gray molded plastic in it. Until and unless we get an expansion for it, though, it doesn't offer anywhere near the variation that IA does.

If you only want to get one, it probably comes down to which sort of game you and your play partner prefer (tactical miniatures combat (IA) or a more strategic, dudes-on-a-map style (Rebellion)) and how much variety you want (IA gets the nod here).
I have both and love both.

I like Imperial Assault more (as a whole) but getting it to the table is much harder then Rebellion. 

If I were to compare just the 1v1 options Rebellion is a better game IMO.

Imperial Assault relies heavily on having a set group you can get to the table consistently.

Rebellion only requires another person to play with.

I have played many more games of Rebellion than IA just because its easier to get someone to play with.
Makes me want to video record all my unboxings from now on :-/
No, never had that happen. It is definitely odd. Are there any weight statements on the tracking?

I've had missing parts of my pledge but the company has usually responded and been able to send them.
That's messed up. Make sure you've got pictures. Does the box look like it was tampered with?
Big question, does the shipping label have the weight on it? 
Well, this opinion appears that it will go against the grain, but I enjoy playing with my brothers when I see them around the holidays. (T-4 days!)
I know the game has balance problems and I know it's chic to pick on it even beyond what it's afforded by those problems. But to me, it's just fun to play, and it's easy enough teach that I can play it with newer gamers that likely won't even notice the balance issues.
We played the crap out of this game, got all the expansions, had a blast.

The whole attack each other to death can strain the dynamics of a game group though, so now it doesn't come out as often as it used to.
Idk what it is about this game but in concept is sounds fun but when you're actually playing it, it's so boring and then it just sorta ends. This is the only game in my collection I won't play and no one wants it so I can't get rid of it. Even when I first bought it I didn't even enjoy it even though it seemed fun from everything I saw. Quite honestly this games disappointment has affected my opinion of many DOW games 
One of the first games I played that got me back into board gaming. A simple enough game so may appeal to those who don't play many games but like a bit of basic strategy too (at least that was me back then). I have since moved on to other games but still enjoy it (digital version) once in a while.

I haven't really played the expansions much, but what I felt from that limited exposure was that it simply shifted some balance problems to new areas rather than made the balance better overall. The dynamics were fun enough but didn't improve the game enormously imo.
This is one of the first board games my boyfriend and I bought when we started collecting. Played it at PAX and enjoyed it, ordered it off amazon before we got home. :-)
Got it last year for Christmas. I still enjoy it.
I feel like the first time I played **Small World**, I had a lot of fun and felt that it was a great game. Every play after that (and there weren't many) was awful though. I sold my copy years ago.
I excitedly bought this game years ago. I had played Vinci at a game meet up and enjoyed it, but it was out of print. Found out that Small World was the same basic game and snapped it up. Small World has some changes (some are improvements, some are arguable) that make the game distinct. You now have two stack of powers (race & power, vs. just one set of tiles that can be combined however they fall), uses coins for points instead of a scoring track, plays for a limited number of turns instead of ending when someone reaches a point threshold, there's now a die you can roll, and has a fantasy theme rather than a post Rome Europe theme. It's this last change that I think has made the game much more successful with broad appeal. Also now they can release new sets of races & powers as expansions easily.

It was a good game that I enjoyed, but I haven't reached for it in years. There are some problems with balance that I can't really forgive. I find the 'well you're supposed to pick on the leader' strategy as a rebuff to this kinda a cop out, especially in a game with hidden victory points. Also whenever this strategy is employed someone will walk away feeling like they were picked on, especially because that other player was getting just as many points as they were.

It's a light euro game that I feel like I've moved passed, and doesn't really have anything that calls me back to it.
One of the rare Days of Wonder games that did not age well.

It was very unique when it came out. It blended area control and euro mechanics into new easily digestible game. It is even considered somewhat of a gateway game. The problem is, who is it a gateway game for? It's really not good as a dudes-on-a-map game. It's not a very satisfying euro. And the balance is really whack. 

After a few plays there isn't much to be had. 
I was so excited about this game when I first played it. I haven't played it in years. Maybe I'll give it another shot.
Small world (underground edition) was my gateway into games, and still play it from time to time. It may not be the best game of all time, but is great fun for a casual gamer
I hate this game. I find it takes forever when people are deciding on new characters to be, the turns aren't exciting, and going into decline happens way too often.  This is one of the only games (maybe the *only* game?) I will outright refuse to play.
They don't have the rights to make blizzard board games anymore so it's gone. I have a copy I played it once was not impressed. 
Licenses are generally deals that run for a few years, Ffg had the Warcraft License for several years, then the deal ran out, without spending money to renew the license, they cannot produce Warcraft products any longer.

Best chance is to get it secondhand somehow.
Like u/Deviathan said...he perfectly described that stuff.  If you want an example, look at what is going on with FFG and GW right now...soon **Fury of Dracula** and titles like **Forbidden Stars** will soon just vanish from the website.
I personally like **Battlecon** MUCH more, BUT the problem with **Battlecon** is that the game is extremely dull for the purposes of a casual game night.  Just like an actual fighting game a game could get fairly boring if an experienced player is destroying someone new, and it also could be fairly boring if both players are not experienced and proceed to just button mash without knowing what they are actually doing.  Now **Battlecon** is definitely (IMO) the superior game if you are looking for a deep, highly replayable experience, but like fighting games it requires people to play it alot to actually get to that level of enjoyment.

So for your situation **if you are indeed going to be playing casually** (i.e. once a month or so), then I would definitely recommend **Ashes** for that situation, and this is coming from someone who really loves **Battlecon**
If I may point you to **Exceed: Red Horizon** by Level99 games - the same developer of Battlecon. I'd like to think of it as a more casual version of battlecon and most reviewers say the same thing as well. It has a sprinkle of luck as opposed to BC which evens out the playing field between beginner and experts, and it's gameplay is easier to pick up by casual gamers as well. I've had a ton of luck introducing this game to all sorts of people, just yesterday me and my cousin had a lot of fun playing it - he's definitely a boardgame casual. 

Ashes is really a promising game but the deck customization aspect of it prevents it from being a casual game atleast in my opinion. Sure you can just play the prebuilt decks but you're missing out on experiencing everything the game has to offer. Finally, the expansion problems is the final nail that prevented me from buying into the game. 
Check out the online website for BattleCon. You'll need to register an account, but you can grab freebie PnPs for 4 characters (2 from War/Indines, 2 from Dev/Indines). Print them out, try them out, and see from there! Rulebook and tutorial also available on that site.

Best way to know for sure if it's something for you or not!
**Codex** - even though it has in-game deck building, compared to Ashes where you're going to pre-create decks, may be very much up your alley.  

Between BattleCON and Ashes, I'd definitely say go w/BattleCON.  There's been some issues w/getting expansions to Ashes and with the amount of content (ridiculous amount) within BattleCON there's plenty to keep you entertained for an inordinate amount of time
I have a cabinet stuffed with tiny, great games. In no order, here's what's in my cabinet of tiny, great games... that would fit in a stocking:

You could go for **Tides of Time** as opposed to **Tides of Madness** which they gave. It's essentially the same game without the Cthulhu theme.  

Hanabi

Zombie Dice

Great Dalmuti 

Tenzi 

Love Letter

Maybe some custom tokens from Team Covenant of they're into any LCGs?
I haven't seen **Saboteur** mentioned yet.
All of these lists are great, I will add to it:

Castles of Burgundy the card game

Innovation

Jaipur

Kodama

Elevenses for one (if you know any solo gamers)

Age of War

Tides of Time

Check out [this picture](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3125305/love-letter-premium). The gold leaves on each card represent how many of each card are in the game. 
The original 16 cards haven't changed.

A few games that my wife and I play that check some or all of your boxes: Le Havre, Agricola, Robinson Crusoe, Nations, Terra Mystica, and Viticulture Essential Edition
Viticulture sounds right up your alley. Caverna, Agricola, Euphoria, ah so many. 
**Lewis & Clark**  
**Rokoko**  
**Coal Baron**  
**Village** + Village Inn exp  
**Snowdonia**  
**Bruxelles 1983**  
**Kanban**  
... and so many more


Viticulture is my favorite. I also like Agricola and New Bedford, though the latter doesn't have cards. I didn't really love Waterdeep. Nothing wrong with the mechanics, just, I guess when I see the D&D label, I expect a bit of D&D in the game.
I'd look into Concordia and maybe Deus, although neither is a worker placement. 
**Yedo** is a great next step from Waterdeep. Includes worker placement, card decks, and resource gathering. You fulfill quest cards like Waterdeep, but you have a personal tableau of (mostly) permanent upgrades you build up.
Viticulture is really good. 
I really like **The Manhattan Project.** Here is how it plays a little differently.

* You can't use other player's buildings unless you go on the Espionage spot

* Rapid placement on your own buildings gives an engine building feel

* You get to choose when to recall your agents

* You can bomb other player's buildings so they can't be used until repaired.


My favorite game is **Alchemists,** which is also worker placement... but it's quite a step up from Lords of Waterdeep.  If you like logic puzzles, it could be something to check out.
You should take a look at Champions of Midgaard. It's quite similar to LoW, but adds the twist of combat to finish quests as opposed to simply gathering the needed resources.
**The Voyage of Marco Polo** uses dice as "workers" but other than that in my opinion is quite similar with LoW. It collect camels, gold, silk and peppers, it has contracts (like quests in LoW), more action place in city cards (like buildings in LoW), variable character powers (more exciting than LoW). It does not have the equivalent of intrigue cards, though.

**Argent: The Consortium** is what I consider as LoW in steroids. It has lots of resources (mana, coins, wisdom/intelligence/research). It has workers which have special powers (red worker can attack another worker, green immune to red's attack, blue immune to spell etc). It has variable character power. It has spells which can really mess up your enemy. Not only more magical than LoW, Argent also brings player interaction up to eleven!
Aren't those the shapes from Qwirkle?
No, but this site might help: [Dice Collector](http://www.dicecollector.com/)
Looks like a toddler game maybe.

Twister?
Twister?
Looks like cranium to me!
I have to follow this now. I definitely remember this die from my childhood (90s) but can't remember the game
RemindMe! 7 days
Reminds me of the die you roll in Geek Out to figure out which question you get out if the 5 on the card.  Have any trivia games like it? 

It's bugging me because I'm confident I've seen that same die before but it's not coming back to me.  
Looks a little bit like the dice in **Subdivision**.
This was the closest thing I could find online. I'm guessing that it was part of an educational shape drawing game. Good luck!

Just had to get replacement parts from Stonemeier and they were great. Just go through their website. On mobile right now so I can't link, but if you search it should come up.
Well that sucks, especially since I also ordered it from MM and it's supposed to get here in a week.  One side of the board is supposed to be in German since they did a shared print run for it, but I'm pretty sure everything else should be in English.  I've heard that Stonemaier is good at replacing things, so you should be able to get the English components [here](http://stonemaiergames.com/about/replacement-parts/).
Just contact Stonemeier and they'll ship you out the correct cards.
I own the German version of the game and it has a double sided board with German on one side and English on the other. Maybe they got mixed up. Do you know which language the other side is?
Only one I have is the Christmas version of Love Letter. 
Only one I've heard of is the 12 Days of Christmas card game (I think its in a tabletop espisode). It's on Amazon, also noticed there's Holiday Flux too
You could do your own version of Code Names with christmas words. Just cut up some paper and put xmas words on them and maybe print out a couple of reindeer for one team and elves for the other team and each team is trying to "collect" xmas items by covering them with there cards. Have the bomb card be the grinch or something. 
Maybe make your own version of Avalon or Secret Hitler with a Christmas theme?  Like, instead of Merlin you could have Santa, and instead of Percy you could have Cindy Lou Who.  Morgana would be the Grinch, no idea who the assassin/Mordred would be with that theme though (I just like the idea of Cindy Lou Who trying to figure out who's the Grinch and who's Santa.)
My best recommendation is telestrations party pack but remove the cards in the game you use to draw and write your own adult Christmas themed ones instead. This is what I'm doing at my party this year! We did it for Halloween a year ago and it was hilarious. 

Alternatively, funemployed has a holiday expansion (but it includes all major holidays).
I guess you could do a create your own card variant on popular games like say anything that come with categories and replace typical cards with holiday themed deck instead of you has time.

Otherwise crappy birthday could be called crappy Christmas and kept the same in theme. 
when you say adult games do you mean "naughty"? like a game that is both christmas themed and of the "after dark" variety?

Roll for the galaxy (and I assume race as well) and terraforming mars are the 2 that I own. Both good games. 
Love tableau building games. Here are some favorites:

**51st State Master Set**

**Saint Petersburg**

**Ora et Labora**

**Roll for the Galaxy**

**Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization**

**Bruges**

**San Juan** / **Puerto Rico**

**Tournay**

**Port Royal**
**Race for the Galaxy** is my personal favorite, followed by **San Juan**. Their ancestor **Puerto Rico** is on my shelf, but I haven't had a chance to play it yet.
Viceroy
On the heavier side **Pax Pamir** and **Pax Renaissance**
Deus wasn't mentioned yet and that is the king of Tableau building in my eyes. It does get a bit tight on space and aggressive on taking points on the map away.

And even Terraforming Mars may hit that spot. It may be more engine builder though. It does have some interaction but nothing I would rate above light aggression that only happens a few times throughout the whole game.
**Castles of Burgundy** might be my favourite game. The mechanics are so tight in this game.

**Arcane Academy** Picked this up recently and enjoy the tableau part of the game. It's pretty light compared to most other tableau games. I like the chaining of powers that you can build. It does have a bit of player interaction though.

**Princes of Florence** Building an estate to encourage scholars and artists to create great works. Great auction system with interesting choices.

**Patchwork** Two player building a quilt with Tetris inspired pieces. Such a simple mechanics for a great game.

**Cottage Garden** I have this on order. Similar game as patchwork.

Haven't played it but **Lunarchitects** looks interesting. It's based on the highly rated **Glen More**.
Just played **Isle of Skye** for the first time today. Its like Carcassonne except everyone builds individually. Definitely some other economic interactions though.
**Deus**.  
**Suburbia**

**Castles of mad king ludwig** are some others.  Really depends upon your definition of tableau building I suppose.  Some say cards, others (including me) say whatever stuff you have in front of you that you've built up. 

Fun games.  La granja no siesta looks interesting as well.

Other recommends within responses are fab.  I'll second Pax Porfiriana (Pax $whatever nowadays), Innovation, St Pete (love this game lately)


just so happy to see someone with similar tastes!

many *tile laying* games will fit this bill, but often as you noted with **quadropolis**, they might lack an engine building aspect. some good games to start with might be:

**elysium** (this one is so good! player interaction is almlst exclusively limited to some rather tight drafting. the tension in the game is all about keeping cards in order to use their powers or banking them for points and losing their power. it's very satisfying.)

**automania** (player interaction via worker placement and tile drafting, but aside from that it's mostly just a race to see who can churn out the best cars. this is a new favorite!)

**puerto rico**

**san juan**

**race for the galaxy** (san juan on crack)

you might also check out **grand austria hotel**, which is a fantastic combination of tile laying, action selection, and drafting. i'm not sure it meets your criteria exactly, but you essentially described my favorite type of game (building with minimal interaction), and this is one of my all time favorite games. so check it out!

Race for thr Galaxy is very deep and rewarding. Roll for the Galaxy is more interesting to non gamers. 
**Imperial Settlers** gets play every week at my house.
If the minimal interaction includes drafting then

**Among the Stars** : you are building a space station.

**Glenmore** : scottish village (?)

If you don't mind a heavy game:

**Innovation**
What about **San Juan** 
This may be a little left-field, but consider Talisman. It has the same "move around the board, encounter things" interaction along with a journey of gaining power so you can conquer the center of the board.


As far as playing with kids go: there is very little hidden knowledge in the game (none if you house-rule that spells are not hidden). This means that adults can help kids play their turn easily. I have a friend that plays with his kids and they have a blast.
Grimslingers isn't technically dark tower, but it has a lot of similarities to the universe.  Great art, simple game. Might be as close as you'll get.
Burgle Bros and Pandemic are, by far, my two favorite cooperative games. But for Pandemic Legacy, Burgle Bros would by far be my #1.
**Mechs vs Minions**. Players control mechs to complete various mission objectives (there are 10 missions). You draft a command card each turn, put them in your programming board and execute them. Attack or stomp those pesky minions before they damage your mechs! Damaged mech stays in the game but draw a damage card which messes up your programming. Very fun!
**Flash Point** - rescue people (and cat! and dog!) from burning house together

**Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective** - great to nut out solutions as a team

If you like a darker, Lovecraft theme, the newly released **Arkham Horror Card Game** is fabulous. **Also Arkham Horror** and **Eldritch Horror** are brutal but great to play.

**Hanabi** is a lot of fun.
**Ghost Stories** is a really tough game about kung-fu movie heroes busting ghosts. 
A lot has been mentioned already but if you liked Pandemic you could take a look at **Dead Men Tell No Tales**. The gameplay is a bit like a mix of **Pandemic** and **Flash Point: Fire Rescue** with a piratey theme!

More games that haven't been mentioned so far that might strike your fancy:

**The Big Book of Madness**

**Legends of Andor**


I know some people have strong opinions against it but I really enjoy elder sign. 
Forbidden Island and Shadows over Camelot are two co-op games that get a lot of play at my house.
Let's see:

Forbidden Desert (very pandemic Esq).

Aeons End (Coop Deckbuilder).

Legendary Games (Coop deck builder).

Sentinels Of the Multiverse (Very fiddly IMO).

Shadows over Camelot/Battlestar Galactica (Traitor Mechanics).

Flash Point (also very pandemic Esq).

Robinson Crusoe (very fun but very challenging).

Mansions of Madness (horror coop story driven).






Mysterium, Beyond Baker Street, Samurai Spirit
**Black Orchestra** A game about German conspirators trying to take out Hitler while not getting caught by Gestapo.
T.I.M.E. Stories is pretty incredible. My favorite co-op game!
Forbidden desert and island are nice. Very simple and clean theme. More likely to win these than most coop.

Ghost stories is my personal favorite but don't expect to win very much. It's just really fun to play anyway. 

Zombicide is nice if you like the theme of dead of winter but not the betrayal, secret goals, or mechanics. If you do like the betrayal, go for betrayal at house on hill.

Shadows over Camelot is really fun if there's a secret betrayer but kind of boring without so that's an option if you like the King Arthur theme.
If you like pandemic style theming, then you might like XCOM. It's tech themed and save the world. Everyone has different roles but all work together. 
[Dead Men Tell No Tales](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141423/dead-men-tell-no-tales)
There are a ton of good suggestions in this thread, so I'm going to go with something no one else has mentioned and say that you should get **Space Alert**. Real-time cooperative game about surviving in space. Great stuff. 
Have a look at **The Grizzled**
Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective 
If your family liked scrabble, then **Paperback** is a fun deck building game with a good co-op mode.
[Like this?](https://imgur.com/gallery/kmiTX)
I don't own the game, I just wanted to say that it is very grand of you! :)
Cut the board along each seam, shadow mount the individual pieces, put each player's character card and pawn in the display with a mix of other cards, and give them out to each player.
Someone posted [this](http://imgur.com/IQ6NinV) a while ago for Risk Legacy, which I thought was pretty neat. The guy who did it said he was also planning to frame the board to go along with the shadow box. (Potential Risk Legacy spoilers in there, but you have to zoom in to get any real details - though be warned one of the extra factions is very clearly visible)
Burn it. It's the only way to be sure of eradicating all of the diseases.
Some friends have mounted it on their wall with various means. 
One friend of mine got a huge frame and framed the board/cards/etc and hung it on the wall, shadow box style. It looks great. 
I believe it was Rahdo who mentioned you can still use the board to play your own custom version of regular Pandemic. I haven't tried it myself but you could get some mileage out of that if you want to look back fondly at the legacy campaign you went through.
I don't see why you can't just use it to play regular pandemic. I've done that a few times, just ignore the stickers and other legacy stuff. You could even treat each month's rules as an "expansion" or sorts and replay that one.
You could reset the board to the start and use it to play regular Pandemic. If you look up how various Pandemic expansions work, you could probably use most of the legacy components as expansion bits. I haven't done it with my copy because I'm not really a big fan of regular Pandemic (and neither is my fiance), so I haven't gotten around to it.
Is it possible to resell? Sorry if the answer is obvious, I haven't played it yet. 
I love lanterns! It's a simple to learn game that is very fun. 
I guess you can't go wrong with some family classics like **Splendor**, **Takenoko**, **Mysterium**, **King of Tokyo**, **Forbidden Desert/Island**. I would go probably for somethin cooperative as it is missing in the list. Maybe even to Pandemic Legacy, if she would have a group and if she likes the basic Pandemic. 
Takenoko is a good call. What is the size of her normal game group?  Codenames is a fun party game.  Also, maybe get Love Letter too for her stocking.  Good quick game and cheap.
Takenoko or takaido are both good
Take a look at **Splendor**, **Shakespeare** or **Rokoko**.
Camel Up is light and silly fun

Lords of Waterdeep 

Betrayal at House on The Hill 

Bang Dice (specifically The Dice Game. Plain Bang sucks) 

Coup
lanterns is *okay*. i would check out **tokaido** or **jamaica** or even **stone age**. :)
Patchwork if she plays 2-player a lot. 
Let's see, Suburbia or Castles of Mad King Ludwig would be great choices!
Lanterns, takenoko, and machi Lori could be nice for her!

If she likes ticket to ride and Catan then she might really enjoy one called Russian Rails, which essentially is like mixing those two together. You build railways but have to manage worker placement and resources. Despite not being a huge Catan fan, I do enjoy this game.
[It could be the Mini Chimera sleeves from
Mayday Games.](https://www.maydaygames.com/collections/card-sleeves/products/mini-chimera-card-sleeves)
Can you ask the person you bought it from?
Most of the game store around my area sell the [Ultimate Guard Purples](https://www.amazon.com/X-Wing-Premium-Game-Sleeves-Pack/dp/B019AN5M8C/) made specifically for X-Wing. 
You see the same spikes in popularity for a bunch of gateway board games.

Here's [Ticket To Ride](https://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore?q=ticket%20to%20ride)

[King of Tokyo](https://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore?q=king%20of%20tokyo)

[Martin Wallace's Brass](https://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore?q=Martin%20Wallace%27s%20Brass)

I think it would represent the searches performed by folks who are looking to buy these games as Christmas gifts for friends and family, as well as the searches from folks who just got copies and want to learn more about them.
Or people searching about it after they got it for Christmas?

Also, what's going on in Argentina?
Google trends shows what people search for, so I guess Christmas lists fill up with it each year.
The top of each spike seems to line up with the week *after* Christmas, so presumably it's either people going "What the hell is this gift I received?" or people who got suckered into playing it by the one geek member of the family and then went "Where the hell do I buy that game?"
Gambling AND low RNG? 

Those are contradictory...

I'm still going to recommend Lords of Vegas. Gambling theme. Appears random, but the drawing from a deck guarantees a mostly even distribution. 

4p, 6 with expansion
Power Grid? 
out can't go wrong with any of those games. Depending on what he/she likes you could also check out Viticulture or Lords of the Water deep for a good worker placement.

As for deck builders. I would personally pass on Dominion. While there it is known as a staple I personally think the are other deck builders. Clank! Is a good example, especially since it has a push your luck/gambling aspect.
Those are all quite good--I'm especially fond of Carcassonne. Inis is my latest obsession, which fits most of your requirements (2-4 players, c. 1 hr, easy to learn but a ton of nuance, soft area control).

Edit: Dominion is great, but I like Arctic Scavengers much more as a derivative of it.
Take a peek at **6 Nimmt** - quite simple but there is a major skill ceiling.

Another worth peeking at would be **Can't Stop** even though that stops at 4 players.  It's a ridiculously simple concept but has a super fun push-your-luck aspect that could be great to scratch the gambling itch.

Now let's look at my favorite gambling game : **Pandante: Light & Dark**.  The 1st edition was pretty muddy with rules and made (for me and my group) a rather unpleasant experience.  Sirlin caught onto that, simplified and streamlined and man 2nd edition is a hoot.  But you really do need a very competitive group who is into the concept (poker w/powers at its most simplified).


For mega high skill ceiling and 4 players only (IMO and preferred) check out **Tichu** simple card game that's played in teams.  Nasty fun.

It's a step up in initial complexity but perhaps have a peek at **Dominant Species** that is a vicious game too.  Was a hit with teenage/early adults I've played it with.  
Personally, I like dominion online much better, no set up, no shuffling, no counting, just pure playing.
Cosmic Encounter seems like it might be a good fit for him
Isle of Skye and Abyss might appeal to him.
Pandemic and Carcassone are good.  I really enjoy Ticket to Ride.  I personally find Dominion to be incredibly boring.
Ticket is nice. Lot of people like it. Similar theme with more brain power and strategy is Russian rail. I highly recommend Russian rail for strategy. 

He may also enjoy viticulture but that isn't a short game to play. 
**Vegas Showdown**

Not really gambling, but bidding and outbidding is fundamental part of this one, which feels similar to Castles Of Mad King Ludwig with a Vegas twist.
Tabletop simulator on steam looks like it's available on Mac and PC
Boardgamearena works fine. Tabletopia is better with a mouse than a track pad. 
I'll second Board Game Arena and have played many games on there and have even been a paid member in the past.

I also enjoy going to http://www.boiteajeux.net/, specifically for Castles of Burgundy and Agricola.
You can play board games on websites like BoardGameArena.com or Boiteajeux.com. There's a LOT of board game websites that you can play with together. Just grab a Mumble or Skype or whatever and chat and play. You can also use Vassal which is a java? based open source board game engine that has a mac port.
Armello!
The way an adventure can come back to haunt you in the event deck feels super thematic. A beast follows you back to camp and later attacks. The wound you suffered exploring gets infected. You constructed your shelter poorly and now it collapses. It all feels real and the random nature of when mistakes come back to haunt you is probably one of my favorite parts of the game. 
I would say a lot of the story elements are thematic, like what the other user said about beasts following you back to camp and the numerous variations of "bad weather" negative events. That said, I don't think the mechanisms are the most thematic. If I go hunt and my friend goes to explore or someone to build, and an event causes my attack to drop, I could lose the hunt even though we are supposedly doing separate actions in the same day. I suppose one explanation is how everyone has two pawns with them representing different times of day, but I think something like individual attack powers would be more thematic (but also more clunky).

After that, there are some other things which aren't mechanically thematic, like rolling dice for resolutions, but that depends what you think the dice represent.
You might want to look into Arctic Scavengers. SUSD have a great review of it. 
Have you seen the Kickstarter for Hero Realms? It's a deckbuilding game with CCG/LCG mechanics. It's by the creators of Star Realms and Epic. Incidentally, Epic is a fun little Magic/GoT-like game which is self-contained. It's not symmetrical though. 
It is beneficial to play the Knight before rolling for resources in order to move the robber off your land. 

For other types of Development cards, it's probably better to hold on to them. For example, playing the Monopoly card will likely net more value AFTER you roll for resources than before.
The only one it really makes any sense for is the Knight. But yeah, you can play it before rolling. 
Yes. 
The [Revised Edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10093/axis-allies) was the first one with the Destroyers and Artillery pieces
Axis and allies:1942 second edition?
Some good choices:  
**Trajan**  
**Shakespeare**  
**The Voyages of Marco Polo**  
**Village** + (Village Inn exp)  
**Concordia**  
**Discoveries**
How about **Five Tribes**? No luck, beautiful design with interesting one of a kind mechanisms.
Have you played Istanbul?
Concordia? 
**Blokus** is a cheap and fun tactical game.
**Agricola**!  The king of worker placement games.
Viticulture
Just checking -- you are playing that they replace your entire turn, right?
We've not found them completely overpowered at all, no.

If you use a guild card, you can perform no other action that turn.

One turn to retrieve a guild card, and then one turn to activate the guild card -- I find typically guild cards have the equivalent effect of 1.5 actions -- but they provide you the flexibility to use it when far away from usual target tile. Not at all OP in our experience.
Sounds similar to a game I played called "Bullshit." Basically you could claim you had 4x Kings, even if you only had 3x and play 4 cards. If someone called "bullshit" on you, you had to prove them right or wrong. If you were caught lying you took the entire discard pile, if the other player was wrong they took it instead.

We used to have people play their whole hand as one stack, call 4x whatever and then the next player would throw their card down before anyone could call "Bullshit" but that would probably be deemed full on cheating. Caused a lot of laughter though.

Wiki calls it "Cheat" 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_(game)
Its very similar to shit head with a bit of bullshit thrown in. 
This sounds like a variation of the game I know as "Big Two" or "Scum and Emperor".
It seems to have elements similar to both Cheat and Shithead. Sounds like a good game, I like the scoring system too.
...and then there is Inis
If you want tons of fighting and a cool battle system with power ups and a small element of bluffing (a la Princess Bride Battle of Wits) then **Kemet** is the way to go.

If you love the cold-war tension of watching everyone's army slowly build up on a map until it reaches a point where you don't know what's going to happen next (or even better, everyone knows exactly what's going to happen next everyone is trying to stop each other from making sure that doesn't happen), get **Cyclades**.
What specifically are you looking for in the dudes on a map genre? What about blood rage do you enjoy? 
Never played Blood Rage.


Played Kemet once. Love the power tiles aspect, but dislike the teleportation clusterfuck combat. I already own Nexus Ops and was trying to get something very different.



Traded for Cyclades along with the Hades expansion and I love it. Base game is a tense and skillful bidding game more than anything, though you have to be able to recognize when you can make power plays with Ares or mythological creatures. Hades modules enhance the ability to make unexpected offensive plays, plus a number of other welcome changes (e.g. mythological creatures can stick around longer and wreak havoc).
Kemet is my number 1 game

Cyclades has dice in the combat, which is a fatal flaw

Inis is a better Blood Rage (card drafting + area control)

Kemet still wins over Inis, thanks to the incredible wealth of strategies thanks to the tech trees and the action selection pyramid mechanic being so good. (Hint, save move/attack actions for the end of each round). The components are gorgeous, the map is variable for different player counts, and the expansion offers a ton of new modules to mix it up if it starts getting stale (which will take a long time).
We have all 3 in our group. As much as I think that **Kemet** is slightly better than **Cyclades** (atleast when comparing the base games, **Cyclades** with expansions might be better) I would say to go with the latter. **Kemet** has a lot more simmilarieties to **Blood Rage** than **Cyclades**. Getting **Cyclades** will bring something fresh to the table. The auction mechanic is great and it has a different (than points) win condition.
Cyclades. Still my favourite DOAM, but I do have all the expansions.
I own Blood Rage, Kemet and Cyclades and I played them all several times.

To me Cyclades is still the best of the bunch, although you can't really go wrong with any of them.
Personally, I really did not enjoy cyclades, auctions took too long, it was annoying looking up the monsters everytime (the symbology wasn't too helpful), and it was very difficult to get anything set up militarily because it's so apparent what you are trying to do. It was a slog. I've heard the expansion makes this better but I'm not tryna spend $40 on top of a $40 game to make it playable.

For me, Kemet is much faster, you can try out new strategies each time, and plays well at 3-5 (Cyclades probably only 4-5.

However, you're going to hear proponents of both games. I would suggest you figure out if you group is AP prone, if you like auctions, or if you like constant fighting rather than careful positioning. It's really gonna be group dependent. 
DOAM = **Chaos in the Old World**.  Different mechanics than Blood Rage, Cyclades, Inis, Kemet.  

This topic has been discussed many a time.  


Man what a great idea. If anyone is in the LA region and would be willing to show me how to play the game...
Wow! I had no idea people in my area were on the boardgames reddit! I may or may not be there. I'm already going all in on KDM though. :)
I live in south Jersey, near Philadelphia, and would always welcome the chance to play the game more. I also have all current expansions as well.
Awesome, if I was nearby I'd be there!
Varies widely, particularly who made it. Sometimes they are cheap cash grabs, or made by people without much boardgame experience and may have a good idea but it's poorly developed or implemented. 

Some are great, however, as was the case with Starcraft.

Bloodborne is made by Eric Lang so it definitely has thay going for it.
Bioshock Infinite: Siege of Colombia is extremely fun to me. If you're a fan of thematic games, depth of play, strategy & luck combos, etc. I would certainly recommend it!
I mean, anything that tries to confine itself within the restrictions set forth by another medium is going to have a rough start, and people will give it a hard time no matter what. X-Com seemed to do well, and I've heard Uncharted is a decent game. Generally though, I don't think they translate all that smoothly.
Xcom is good. I've heard Civ was good and am looking forward to trying it soon. The main difference is that video games get to have thousand page rule books because only the computer needs to read them. Only the simplest concepts can translate into a game. A great example is Potion Explosion. It's not "really" Bejeweled, but it's like the same idea, even simpler, and it makes a perfect board game. 
They're all over the map. I actually thought **DOOM** by FFG was pretty good. I haven't played the newer edition yet, though. Pretty much all the videogame-flavored older games (Monopoly, Risk, Yahtzee, Trivial Pursuit) are hideous cash grabs. I found **The Witcher** more disappointing than *bad*.

I can't speak to **Bloodborne** though. Haven't played it.
I kickstarted Dark Souls board game and am hopeful that it is entertaining (one guy in my group is a massive fan of DS).

Dunno about bloodborne haven't checked out bg or vg of it. 

But in general yeah I'm usually pretty wary of bgs made after vgs.  Can easily come off as a reach-out to another audience for whatever possible minimal cash grab / lure to vg.  But that's me maybe I'm a bit jaded.
Bloodborne card game looks pretty cool, might pick it up. I've considered the Resident Evil deck building game, but I'm not a huge RE fan so I'll probably stick with other deck builders. I love The Witcher, but I'm not too sure about the board game adaptation.
The Bloodborne card game sucks, just to save you time and money.  
I would add some variation to **Castles of Burgundy**'s color palette, and re-release it with all of the championship player boards because they're awesome.
I would change the Fall symbol in **Keyflower** from whatever leaf it currently is to a maple leaf so that it is easier to differentiate from the spring leaf symbol.
Some more variable set ups for **Caverna** instead of just the standard ones for each player count.
Make Mottainai and Innovation easier to learn.
I would love a fully co-operative mode for Imperial Assault. 
Android Netrunner: NBN would be somewhat balanced
In Roll for the Galaxy, I'd change it so that everything was cards and there were no dice. You'd pay for things by discarding cards from your hand and you'd put a card face down on a planet to show it's got a good instead of a die. Seems like it'd make the game faster and more interesting.  
  
/s

For real though. I guess I'd probably make the Roll player mats out of thick cardboard. I'd also like bigger & better quality VP chips, but I'm working on that custom upgrade.
This one is more of an annoyance than anything else. In **Food Chain Magnate**, I'd have the milestones be exclusive in their award; no sharing milestones between players. In the event two players would achieve one, have turn order decide who gets it. That we don't try more to encourage players to be as different as possible and create strategies around that difference is a shortcoming of the game to me. It's a perfectly fine game as is, but it could have better in my eyes.  

I get the reason you have to draw your cubes and then dump and sort everything in **SNCF**/**Paris Connection** but it still sucks to do it. I'm not sure I have a solution there that maintains that hidden information aspect of it which I think is a core piece.  

Last, but not least, I think the ARVN/US coalition is too powerful in **Fire in the Lake**. For either the VC/NVA to really get a foothold and success requires that the COIN side to not work together well and I've seen multiple games with experienced players where they do, eliminate the VC from play, beat on the NVA a little bit and the ARVN win (I've done it, and had it done to me as well). It's intended to be a 1v1v1v1 game, but it really comes off as a 2v2 that degenerates to every man for himself (at various rates of speed depending on who is playing) because of the efficiency of using the "the enemy of my enemy is my friend, *for now*" principle. For as many games of this as I have played, I'm not sure exactly what I'd do to change it... There isn't enough incentive for the COIN sides to bicker in the first half of the game (regardless of how many coup cards there are).
I would get rid of the base rules in **Trickerion**, making the Dark Alley a part of the base game. I'm convinced some people who don't like Trickerion it's because they've only played the simplified version.
Dominion. I would change the artwork, Dominion is an amazing game but it often looks horrible, just look at the main logo! 
**Lords of Waterdeep** with meeples instead of cubes.
**Key Market** - I would reprint it (so I could own a copy) with upgraded components so the resources wouldn't split into layers (original made of plywood).  
In Alchemists I would like to have more cubes available (4 is too few!) and more turns, 6 is not enough!

Magically i would like the length to be the same, though.
Just bought Inis and the victory conditions aren't on the player card. Why???
Star Realms... if I had to pick just one thing to change about it, I would have the first player get only 2 cards, but he could pick them. 

Several of the Gambits/Events could use a re-do, as could the Promos, but at least in the base game the first player just has too much of an advantage.
Location reference cards in spyfall, one for each player. I've said this since day 1, before vasel
**Escape** would have a more noticeable noise to signal you to move back to the center...it blends into the background drums too easily.


I would like Blood Rage to have thick cardboard rather than thin cardstock mats. 
Include 3D miniatures, or at least better art on the tiles, for **Food Chain Magnate**. With that said, it's still one of my top games.
I would change certain players in games like secret Hitler. There are two that join in sometimes and I'll catch them trying to look at policy cards sometimes when the P or C is sitting next to them.  
  
I would also change blood rage to not have so many damn mechanics locked behind KSE.
I'd make **Sentinels of The Universe** scale better with different number of players. Or at least make it work with two heroes (or even one for Solo) in play out of the box, without needing to come up with variants or playing multiple hands.
But does IDKFA still work?
Wait, so the game includes an expansion for a different game? Hopefully I am misunderstanding this.
Looks to me like bonuses when you sell certain colours of goods? 

Seems like it could be a neat addition, reminds me a bit of the boats module in **Bruges: City of the Zwin**. Buffing an action already in the base game.
I think the expansion would be for the board version, not the card one
Yeah.. but mine [is more legit](http://i.imgur.com/5MUslXv.jpg)...
D20 is unbalanced...always rolls a 12
That looks amazing! They'd probably enjoy it over at /r/DnDIY too.
While this is super cool... why would anyone want a dice tower? I always wondered as it takes the joy of actually rolling the dice.
How to come by the parts that were used for this? Is the tower 3D printed? 
Can I show off mine, [too](http://crystal-twist.deviantart.com/art/Ghostbusters-firehouse-dice-tower-4-460161167)?

Nice but broken - it's the same number everytime I watch!
Citadels!!!
that's pretty awesome. rtfg doesn't seem very dice tower friendly though. heh.
I read this post as "My housemate is an amazing dice tower" I was confused and wanted to see where this was going.
I want one...
Wow, this look absolutely awesome!
Does this help combat against dice bias?
But... but... it only rolls "12's" :(

Seriously though, that's badass :D Props to your buddy!
That is awesome!  :) 
So badass! 
This is sooo awesome!! Love the detail. Where to get?
I am  in the same boat.  I was backing Feudum, but now at the $1 pledge level on both while I decide.  Was really excited about Feudum, but getting concerned with the lack of reviews and play throughs - and to get the complete game (with expansions) shipped is $121.  That is a lot of money for an new designer/publisher.

I also find it kind of sketchy that he is still using Rahdo's quote about how he can't wait for the game to come out even after Rahdo declined a prototype after reading the rules.

I was hoping to hear feedback from others from BGG Con, but I'm starting to think he didn't take the game with him.
Cancelled my Feudum and went for Lisboa. Lacerda has a good track record, rahdo's run through was fantastic, and a solo varient is being worked on by Lacerda too. 

Feudum looks interesting by I'm going with Lisboa. 
Vital Lacerda game with Ian O'Toole art vs. Something else? 

Yeah - I went with Lisboa. Not even a choice. 
Whichever has the best stretch goals, with shipping they are both within $10 of retail price so you can pick them up later without worrying
Frankly, I hate the style that Feudum has gone with.  It does not look like an attractive game to me.  But it certainly is unique.
Neither.  If money is tight you don't want to buy an expensive game that you might not end up enjoying.
I went with Feudum. But that's mostly based on me preferring the art style.
I got both but if I were forced to choose I'd go Lisboa. Vital has a great track record in my books and I hated missing the gallerist first time around. 
I am backing Feudum. The art style is incredible and based on the rule book it looks like a very compelling and original game. I also really get the impression that the whole thing is a labor of love. 


Lisboa also looks great, but I am pretty wary of the publisher, Eagle Gryphon, they have done some shady things. 
Neither. If you can only afford to back one of them, you're better off buying a game that's already in print.
By the way, look at boardgamegeek's file for a free download of 5 new solo opponent's.  Much more fun than the ones in the box.
Leave the energy marker at maximum and expand its empire at the end of its next turn.

**PUERTO RICO** iS THE GAME YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. 
To be honest, something like Dominion isn't hugely dependent on luck. I think you're looking for games with Perfect Information. That's more of a feature than a genre, so suggestions will vary wildly. 

Food Chain Magnate and Battlecon are the only two that I can think of with Perfect info. Pretty much everything else has randomness somewhere, mostly in set up. Even fcm is guilty of that. 
Concordia! 
Go
Look up Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar 
Diplomacy, though play with people you are ready to dump as friends...
If you hate your friends, give **Diplomacy** a shot
**Terra Mystica** is my go to deep strategy game. It looks complicated but it is incredibly simple and smooth. Cant recommend enough. For me and my group its definitely like "chess but with more players"
Food Chain Magnate is the best strategy game I can think of with perfect information. Kemet, Cyclades and Inis are all great with pretty minimal RNG involved.
A Game of Thrones the board game [2nd edition] . 

This game can be played either completely without random elements or with a small element of random/luck (in the form if wilding cards at the end of the round).

While you will be a bit more invested in the game if you are familiar with the TV series/books, I've played it with people who have never watched/read the series and they loved it (almost beat me in a game).

The game itself is a grand strategy game where each player takes the role of a house and you win if you finally control 8 castles (castles are dotted around the land). Imaging risk (the land is split into segments) but without the bullsh*ttery of dice rilling; you plan your moves and plan how to make an army and whether to wait to attack with a big army, or to grab castles quickly. You can even forge alliances with other players... And chose how and when you want to break these alliances

I love this game as it's the only "pure" strategy game that I've ever played. Its all down to you and your decisions. The only minor setback that I can think of is games can last 6 hours... Sounds scary, but if you've got a good group of friends it'll fly by.
[Non-abstract games with little or no luck.](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/142664/non-abstract-games-little-or-no-luck)

[“Non-random” games.](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/11227/non-random-games)
Do you have a preference for number of players?

My initial suggestion would be **Patchwork**, once its set up there is no luck or hidden information so it is all down to how you play it. The only downside is that its only 2 players.
**Kemet** might be what you are looking for.  No dice rolling, and mostly open information.  
We have found **Libertalia** and **Revolution** to be less luck-based than Catan and the like, as everyone takes their turns at the same time and the games feel quite fair/balanced.
Ahh, you speak my language! No luck? 

Try **Medina 2nd edition**, **Hansa Teutonica**, **The Gallerist**, **Bruxelles 1893**, **Caverna**, **Tzolk'in**, and **Mexica**, to name a few... Random draws only for set up in some of them... Otherwise everything is public info and static (mostly). But, luck is a minor factor in these games. 

Funny how these I all rated, basically, top ten or twenty . I abhor games where bad luck can cost you the game. 
**Power Grid**  
  
  

Chess would be a good example... but a game that allows for more players, has some building aspect too it. Like a mix between stratego and catan I guess would be the best clue I could give.
Caylus has no random elements after setup. (Initial player order and the positions of the initial buildings are random.)
Game of Thrones: The Board game is entirely strategic (play without the tides of battle cards) and goes up to 6 player.
Imperial comes to mind
Hive is a great 2 player pure strategy game. It is the only newer board game comparable to chess that I've played. I suggest the pocket edition, it's not too small but comes with most the expansion pieces.
Tigris & Euphrates. I cannot recommend this game enough
You might need to be more specific than that...

I'd say any abstract strategy games are good. **GIPF Project** games are purely strategic, 0 luck involved. **Tak** as well.
So, chesslike games, then? Two players, turn-based, no luck? Personally, **Homeworlds** is my favorite -- it's an Icehouse system game where you build up an interstellar army and either capture or destroy your opponent's home planet.

**BattleCON** is also good -- there's no luck, but there is hidden information. It's a turn-based game that simulates high-level fighting game strategy, the idea being that ultimately once you advance past button mashing, fighting games are just very high-speed bluffing games. In BattleCON, you have access to all the information your opponent does at all times, *except* for what attack they've locked in.
Chicago express has no luck or randomness. Yet somehow turns out very differently every time. Also plays quickly. One of my favourite games. 
Would Agricola fit the bill?

The only part of the game that is randomized is which order the action cards flip over. You can also play super competitive or more laid back- although some might disagree.

I've played with my HS board game club and people either target the actions others want, or specifically avoid them and hope the favor is returned. Of course that means you usually end up with people specializing in one method of winning, then branch out only to prevent negative points. 
Games that have no "game randomness" after setup, only "player randomness".

I think of it as Rock Paper Scissors.  The player is the one rolling the RNG so to speak, which you can arguably consider that luck or not since its unlikely we'll discover telepathy any time soon.

**Steam: Rails to Riches**

**Hey! That's my Fish**

**Terra Mystica**

**Revolution (Steve Jackson Games)**

**Hive**: could just be considered an abstract game like Go or Shogi or Othello, but oh well.

**Patchwork**

**Agircola Creatures Big and Small** (note, this is game is not in print, probably bought out by Mayfair and to be reprinted in 2017-2018 if I were to guess).

Not what you're looking for, but the oddest mix of luck and strategy that I've ever run into is Blood Bowl. The game is so utterly random that if you don't apply strategy and stick to it, you will be hopelessly lost. It's kind of weird the way the two elements blend.
**Suburbia**. This is the game you're looking for. 
Look for abstract games. Games like **Battle Sheep** or **Quaridor** or **Onitama** games where information isn't hidden and then all you have left are tactics with extremely minimal luck.
18xx games don't have luck past setup. They are pretty long and unforgiving, but much less intimidating than their reputation suggests. GMT just put out a great edition of 1846, probably the best time to jump in on it if you're interested.

I agree with others that Food Chain Magnate might be what you're looking for though.
I really like the game of thrones board game which has barely any luck involved
Stratego. 
2 player: BattleCON, by far. Think Street Fighter, but pure non random card play. It's honestly amazing

More players: Revolution! Every turn is 100% deterministic - the same inputs always produce the same outputs.
The catch is it's a blind auction, so you don't know for certain if you'll win anything. 
No luck, but the unpredictability of other players cause some people to **feel** it is random

Blokus. Navia Dratp. 

Catacombs is a dexterity game... 
Game of Thrones. Really in-depth and almost completely based on strategy outside of cards between each round that change allowable orders and the wildlings.
I see that you already have some good recommendations for new games in this thread (Hive and Samurai would be a couple that I would second). But I would also note that some games do have "variant" ways to play to reduce luck which can be pretty interesting. For instance with Settlers you can replace the dice roll with drawing numbers from a bag that is seeded with the correct proportion of numbers, then you don't refill the bag until everything is picked. You still have the randomness of what number is drawn when, but it reduces the randomness of things like 2 or 12 hitting far more often then they proportionally would.
The King Is Dead! 
You're looking for:

* No Luck (perfect information)  
* 3+ Players  
* Strategy Games

[**Puerto Rico**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3076/puerto-rico) is my recommendation. It's a classic mid-weight euro game that a lot of people love and was very influential to a lot of modern game design. There's no hidden information or randomness and everything is available to you from the start of the game. Strategy is deep. It also supports 2-5 players.  
You said you're looking for a "party game" below. Well, party games as a genre are generally more social games which are not super strategy heavy and often contain luck, because that allows non-gamers to win. I'm making my suggestion based on the fact that Puerto Rico supports 5 players, as you're not really going to find a "party game" that fits your criteria very well. You could say that **Codenames** has no luck I guess. The strategy though isn't super deep and it's mainly centered around the spymaster giving clues that their team understands. It's not a board game like Risk or Catan, as much as it's a party game like Charades or Pictionary.
Terra Mystica and Puerto Rico are both very low on the luck factor.
Nearly all of the 18xx games are randomness free except for initial seating order.

Container is also randomness free except for initial setup

Diplomacy?

Nearly all abstract games 


Luck in **The Manhattan Project** is limited to the order the buildings appear and which bomb schematics are available. In both cases you will usually have 2-4 player turns before anyone can or will bring the new buildings or schematics into play, so you have time to adjust your strategy. Very tense 2p game, and at 3-5p you will be thinking wheels within wheels within wheels...
Gates of loyang.
Sorry taking so long to get back to these. Had a fun weekend and spent all of yesterday way to hungover to function as a human. Anyways... Randomization at setup is completely fine, however, dominion is about half luck, half strategy. Like any card game. I have heard a lot of Terra Mystica, think I will give that a go, and Tzolkin, definitely looks interesting. Thanks for those suggestions!
How do you get lucky with Dominion?
My favorite limited to no luck games are the following: Blood Rage, it doesn't even have any dice and cards are selected through drafting. Keyflower, auction, tile placement, and worker placement game. The only luck parts are your winter tile goals and what tiles out of the stack come up each season. Caverna, pure worker placement game. 

That's about all I can think of out of my collection that have almost no luck at all.
Chess, Go, Checkers.


I'm from Cape Town, so I can't really help you on the brick and mortar front, but I *can* recommend some online stores you could order from:

[Timeless Board Games](http://www.timelessboardgames.co.za/)

[Raru](https://raru.co.za/)

[Takealot](http://www.takealot.com/)

[Digital Sushi](http://digitalsushi.co.za/)

[Geek Home](http://www.geekhome.co.za/) (Never personally ordered from this site but they seem to be the online store for [Outer Limits](http://www.outerlimitspta.co.za/) in Pretoria)
Joburg does not have tons of brick and mortar shops. Between both joburg and pretoria you have a couple of options though:

- Outer limits in mellville, JHB
- Outer limits in lynnwood, PTA
- Battle Wizards in centurion, PTA

You might have a hard time finding Concordia specifically. I only recently got my own copy here.

I would say go and see if Outer Limits in JHB has a copy. I know it recently came in with a shipment but only limited copies were available to go to all the different suppliers so i snatched one. Hope this helps! 

Recently bough Sheriff of Nottingham from Takealot and about to buy Carcassonne.

You can also buy them on Amazon, a lot of the games actually ship here. With the import tax and shipping it can either end up around the same price as here or even slightly cheaper. Useful if you need something rare I guess.
I enjoy BattleCon tremendously but it suffers from the same "problem" that my copy of Mage Wars exhibits. I believe you really need a consistent, dedicated partner(s) to really unlock what the game has to offer. If it's going to be the kind of thing that comes off the shelf once in a while you may find yourself with at least a small degree of buyer's remorse. But! If you can actually spend the time with it to make it shine it's absolutely one of the most satisfying battlers on the market.
I love BattleCON because it does an incredible job of replicating the battleground of perfect knowledge that competitive fighting can be, and doesn't feel hamfisted with how it incorporates fighting game concepts like positioning and parrying. The fact that there are ~60 unique characters in the entire roster, each with their own playstyle and movesets, gives it huge depth, provided you're willing to put in the time to really nail down the fundamentals; really, the only barrier is time - it can take a while to click. But if you've got a friend willing to play it with you over and over...man, when it clicks, it's an absolute blast.
BaCON is amazing. Shouldn't take more than 10-20 minutes to teach, but there are some subtleties in the rules to pick up.

It's very successful in emulating the feel of a fighter, and it's enjoyable once you get the hang of it. For the first few games it will probably seem like you're just floundering about until you learn how to pick good card combinations. After that, you're learning how to pick card combinations that beat your opponent's options. This is where the meat of the game is. The whole game pretty much revolves around out-predicting your opponent. The closest analogue for turn to turn play is probably something like competitive Pokémon.

Start with the remastered edition of War, or Devastation. Fate has more complicated characters that beginners won't handle as well. Characters are divided up into difficulty flights which roughly sort them based on how hard they are to play. Your first 5-10 games at least should probably be in the first tiers only, just to understand the fundamentals.
If they already like Legendary, you *might* consider checking out Puzzle Strike. It does fighting games in the style of a deck builder.

I bought War of Indines a long time ago, but I never really got to play it. The people I typically game with found it to be too much of a brain burner, and hated it (it feels fairly chess-like). The people who liked it, I don't play with frequently enough for it to be a good choice, as it takes a long time to learn and doesn't properly get fun unless both parties are very experienced. This might not be a problem for you at all, just be careful, the people who hated BattleCON were semi-gamers too, having played stuff a lot heavier than Legendary. BUT they were not video gamers, so disinterest in the theme may have been part of what killed it.

Puzzle Strike is pretty abstract, but it's easy to learn, and you can play it as a chill game without needing to think too much (but it's deep enough you totally can do tournament rules and really think things through). Unlike most deckbuilders it is highly competitive; you attack each other, as well as buy based on and your opponent's buys. It's my favorite 2-player game, and the favorite of my family as well, despite them having no idea what a "super puzzle fighter" is. 

I've also heard Exceed is a lot easier to learn than BattleCON and just as good.
I've also heard of Yomi? But I think BattleCON is more accessible from where I'm at.
BattleCON is fine but it has a very plodding style and a lot of phases to resolve in a single card play.

It's super dope in the manner that you know all of your opponents cards and can attempt to Yomi out what they are trying to do (But that tbqh takes a ton of plays to get the point you can be a bit more confident in reading your opponent).

It is from that in which I tend to recommend **Exceed** by the same designer as BC.  It is much more flashy, pop pop pop type of game where you have near-absolute control over your movement, has a simpler resolution IMO and I think is more fun for a casual blast-out as well as is easier to get other friends into.  

The only thing you don't really get is the excessive amount of content created for BCon.  I suppose it's like saying Tekken vs. SF vs. whatever in its own right.. I just prefer the snappiness of **exceed** when I am in the mood for that.  Then again there are some days I love to read an opponent and control them in **Yomi**, but there's not that many days anymore where I feel like I want to have a thinky sit down slow plod of battlecon.  Works for some and really is a good game, it's just a little slow for me
There's a "Dino Dice" reskin of Zombie dice.
King of Tokyo is a good dice roller for kids, skip the energy cubes and cards if you want.
I'm thinking Mice and Mystics when my kids get a little older.
Labyrinth is a great game for kids and for all ages.
All those simple little "Spot It" games have been big hits with my kids too, easy little card game filler.
I have a 4 year old board gamer too!  His favorites right now are monza, knuckling Knights (both HABA games), robot turtles and my first Stone Age.

If we are including his 3 year old brother in play animal upon animal, dancing eggs and stormy seas are the favorites!

I haven't come across a single HABA or Hape game for kids that I don't love.
Monza is a good one from Haba, it's a kids version of formula D. Outfoxed is good and teaches some basic logic. Haba has a ton of really good kids games that are fun for adults too. 
My kid turns 4 tomorrow, and he also played Zombie Dice with me, until I sold it. He likes to roll for me in Dungeon Roll, too.

The games that he likes and really understands AND I would recommend are: Magic Labyrinth, Outfoxed, My First Carcassonne, Enchanted Tower, Animal Upon Animal (we have the Small Yet Great version, might want the bigger one), and - I suspect - Click Clack Lumberjack (birthday gift, but it's really pretty simple).
King of Tokyo is a great kids dice game that I am happy to play with my daughter. We started her there at 5, now she is 8. She is a small world, catan, and Takenoko  fan now. They don't stay at "kids games" for long.
**SUPERFIGHT**. Getting to slap together super-weird and crazy attibutes to characters and arguing who'd win is always super funny for my nieces and I. While I've got to explain a few things (mostly historical figures) they still get a huge kick out of it!
My son is that age as well. I got him Monster Factory and it has been fun. It is a tile game similar to Carcassonne but simpler and with bright silly monsters to build. Even little sister two years younger is able to play along and make matches. 
Fish sticks is not terrible for an adult who wants to play with the kids 

My kids were 3 and five and we played hey that's my fish.   Battle sheep.  And kids carascone


The younger one had trouble understanding what's up but the rules are simple and having him in the mix adds a kind of chaotic neutral quality to the game 


My 5 year old seems to get battle sheep and fish sticks as long as I am patient an willing to remind her of the objectives.   I call carascone the map game and have been teaching her to read maps and follow treasure maps and scavenger maps since she was into Dora the explorer when she was 3. :so maybe she has an advantage in kids or carascone. But she loves it and puts up a good fight without guidance 




There is a game called. Bug trails that they both like like dominos with color matching short and simple.  

And easy to learn so if you have other kid guests they can play together 



  
I have heard that Eurika should be great for both kids and grown-ups.
The Amazing Labyrinth is great for teaching kids to think / plan their moves.

King of Tokyo is a good dice roller, with fantastic artwork (King of New York adds extra complexity, so may not be ideal). 
Dexterity games like **Suspend**, **Click Clack Lumberjack**, or **Ice Cool** will probably work.  I don't know about flicking ability at that age, but if you think he could handle it, maybe **Flick 'em Up**.  

Battery powered games like **Loopin' Chewie** or **Bugs in the Kitchen** are always a hit.

Also, I've heard some kids at that age can handle **Castle Panic**.  
My kids have been playing Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, King of Tokyo, etc. since they were 3 and 4 years old.  If your son is interested, let him play what you're playing, don't dumb it down with kids games.  You will be VERY surprised what he's absorbed and how he will handle himself.  All I had to do with my kids to teach TTR was to practice choosing their starting tickets.  Once they saw the overlap in the routes, they were good to go and scoring 80-90 points per game without any help.  Don't underestimate your son!  If he's interested, he's going to be a great gamer! (sooner than you think!)
Hoot owl hoot is a good, super simple introduction to co-op play. Easy to adjust difficultly as kids learn. 
Zombie dice. Back to the future dice game. Both great!

If he likes moving and understands some complexity, then robot rally might be fun for him. You get move cards ad preprogrammed your moves with your opponent in what is essentially capture the flag on an obstacle course.
https://m.facebook.com/boardgameswithkids/
Anything in the family friendly/new player friendly category is good. Things like Ticket to Ride and Power Grid.

Classic word games like pictionary, scattegories, taboo.

Party games are also fine like sushi go, one night werewolf, and timelines. (Timelines is really hard for kids though).

Surprisingly you can still play magic. He'll just play it wrong probably.
Junk Art IMO 
**Insider**. It's like Spyfall but better (in my opinion).

Many people don't like Spyfall due to the stress of being the spy and being forced to make up questions on the spot. This eliminates that and allows everyone to enjoy the game a lot more.
This is a good question in the main:-

* Quick game
* >2 players (involve all)
* Intuitive skill/play
* Repeatable
* hence use often.

I guess Codenames. I made the mistake the buying Pictures without realizing it because the box is too similar. So I will give that away as a present and keep Codenames.

I am interested if there is anything comparative. 

**Captain Sonar** sounds like a complete RIOT if you can get **8 players* - ahem - "on board"...
Codenames Pictures. 
It just came out, but **Hive Mind** will be making an appearance at Thanksgiving for this reason. 
**Dead Last** is a blast. It's definitely not as clever or creative as **Codenames**. It's a completely different feel and can get divisive but it's a good fast filler. Kind of **Cash & Guns**-ish with better, more social mechanics.   
Been having a great time with One Night Werewolf /Vampire
I haven't played these myself since I mostly play in small groups, but you can look up **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** and **Dead Last**. 

Both are rated as being quite light, and doesn't last too long.
**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong**
[deleted]
Codenames.

Codenames:pictures is incredibly overrated. Especially with a consistent play group.
My parents were gamers, I grew up with a giant game room collection that included games that no other families had. An entire section was filled with heirloom games from my great great grandparents. I come from gamers. But I had been lusting at BGG from afar for a very long time, afraid of the price points and never having played a modern designer board game I lurked. But the promise of new gameplay intrigued me, and something to collect as well I must be honest. It wasn't until my BIL brought over pandemic for us to play that I bit the bullet and ordered RFTG... I never looked back and to the detriment of my entertainment budget I gave up being afraid of the price points too ;) 
I had an assignment in college to program Dominion.  I had never heard of Dominion, but by the time I was done I immediately went out and bought it and Intrigue. 
My girlfriend forced me to play Takenoko. That game made me question my understanding of board game culture and I've been.here ever since.
**Tikal**, actually. I got it as a random gift from my grandmother when she went on a business trip. I was 11 and never really got anyone to play it with me, but I still have it.

It's survived multiple moves and capricious purges of belongings, so I figure I'll have it until I'm dead. I have 70+ games now, and Tikal will always be one of them.

Thanks, grandma, I don't really think you understand what a momentous thing you did for me when you picked out that game. :)
Catan
For me, it was loathing playing Monopoly with my 10 yr old daughter. It used to be her favorite game so i'd play it with her anyway. I started looking into modern boardgames and got King of Tokyo and we loved it! Since then we play Splendor, Carcossonne, and Ticket to Ride regularly. My gf has also taken to it so we play heavier games and have a nice little collection going just from the last year or so with some help from this sub :)
Always gotta recommend **Cosmic Encounter**. 

Personally I was always into nerdy shit, which led to the general progression of video games > Holy shit you guys Pokemon > Pokemon TCG > Magic, which led to gaming magazines where I heard about stuff like Diplomacy. Plus I liked games like Stratego and such anyway, so when my cousin got me a copy of Zombies!!! for Christmas one year that was the start of it. Though I didn't really get hardcore into the hobby until college where I discovered a bunch of games through the gaming club there, and also started picking up a few games like Betrayal at House on the Hill and Three Dragon Ante.
I forgot exactly what started it, but somehow I was reading about designer board games and ended up buying Carcassone. Then near the beginning of this year one of my friends bought Betrayal at House on the Hill and we ended up forming a regular board game group and I've bought a bunch of games since then. In the past month alone I've bought:

* Letters from Whitechapel
* Fury of Dracula
* Warhammer Diskwars (plus expansions)
* Jamaica
* Ghost Stories
* Tiny Epic Quest (Kickstarter)
* Sushi Go
* Codenames

Yeah I think I need to tone it down a bit.
Unlike my brother, I wasn't a sporty kid. My parents found a great way to get the family to sit around a table together without the tv, and it was mostly Risk and Scrabble, then Catan and Carcassone.

Later, my college had a game design program, which happened to house their game library in my school's building. I went to play video games, but ended up hanging around the shelf stacked with everything from King of Tokyo to Mage Knight.
**Pandemic** if we're talking games. I loved the idea of a co-operative game. It motivated me to go to a meetup where I played **Thurn and Taxis**.

Which was surprisingly good.

I knew of Pandemic from Tabletop and didn't get to actually play it till much later.

I was in a spoken word poetry group, found out a couple of my friends were always late because they played board games beforehand. Passing through the front hallway one day, they called out that they needed one more player for Betrayal. I figured that I suck at Clue, but at least I'm a warm body. It was the secret alien traitor haunt and it was really amazing. We were all performers in some capacity, most of them were also way into RPGs, so we all got really into it and had a load of fun. I had no clue games were fun. Then we played Smash Up... Almost killed it for me right then and there, but went back a few times and kept having fun with Betrayal and hating Smash Up. About a year later I bought my own Betrayal and it was amazing!
Welcome!

I was just on a buying spree and now I am like whoa I gotta step back and cool it off.

But with holidays coming up, there's a lot of sales.  Aarrgggh


I bought the following over last two months

**Blood Rage**

**Reign of Cthulhu** (Pandemic)

**Legends of Andor**

**Firefly: The Game**

**Nations**

**Suburbia**

**The Lord of Ice Garden**

**Castles of  Mad King Ludwig**

**Tyrants of Underdark**

One of major criterias for me is whether if a game can be played solo so I don't end up having boardgames collecting dust because nobody else want to play them.  There are few I've bought regardless although but I think **Catan** and **Star Trek Catan** will be my only three+ players games

EDIT:  Oh I just realized I never answered the main question!  Growing up I loved boardgames but it was mostly stuff like Clue, Monopoly, Scotland Yard, Risk, and such.  My dad had wargames from Avalon Hills and I always drooled over those but nobody would play with me.  I wound up playing them myself which led to several odd experiences but whatever.  In college I found a group of friends who used to play Risk and Castle Risk (or was it Europe Risk?  Can't recall) so that was nice but we all eventually migrated to RTS games (Warcraft and StarCraft).

Back then, it was pretty much never heard of to find games specifically designed to be solo-able.  Perhaps they did exist but this was pre-internet so I didn't have access to wealth of information we can easily find on internet today.  Few years ago, I happened upon **Mage Knight** and was surprised it could be soloed so it was an immediate purchase.  At same time, I discovered there's few people at work who met up once in a while to play **Game of Thrones 2nd Edition** so I joined them and the funny thing is I ended being the one who introduced other games to them.  Some of popular ones I introduced them would be **Lords of Waterdeep**, **Medieval Mastery**, **Small World**, and **Star Trek Catan** & **Federations** maps.
For me it was a few months ago, my buddy had me buy Tabletop Simulator. In my state of ignorance I scoffed and said that I am not paying good money to play Chinese Checkers and Chess. Fast forward and I find myself now buying anything that looks even remotely interesting from my local store and Amazon. I have been loving Relic and cannot wait to get the expansions. 
I live in Germany, so playing board games was always something one could do. What made me into a board gamer however was when I had an internship in Berlin. Didn't know many people and was bored, so I looked at Meetup for something to do and "the ultimate international board game experience" (or something like that) sounded interesting enough. Only met twice a month, but ~20 people an evening, so we had to split into different tables and one could partner with others that enjoyed similar games. And later in the evening, once the count dropped below 10, we would just all gather for a few rounds of resistance. Great way to get into the hobby.
I had reconnected with a friend I grew up with a couple years back.  He invited my wife and I to come over for dinner with him and his partner.  

After dinner, they suggested a game.  At this point my only "modern" game experience was CAH and I was skeptical.  They set up **Pandemic** and I was hooked.  Actually he and I are getting ready to start **Pandemic Legacy** later this week.  Cannot wait
A couple of Christmases ago, some board gaming friends invited me to stand in for their fourth regular guy. Played Love Letter, Dungeon Lords, and Rex: Final Days of an Empire. That was a long night, but I had a blast.

Then my daughter started seeing a counselor and we were recommended to start having board game nights as a family.

I met a few MTG players last year at school. I got into that hobby and went to draft games with them quite regularly. Those games took place in the local friendly gaming store. So every time I came there I saw the rows and rows of boardgames lining the walls. I got curious about one of them and asked the owner how you needed to play it and he explained it. He also told me that every Wednesday was boardgame night. 

I ended up checking it out a few times with some friends and that's how I ended up loving boardgames.
Actually I've loved board games my whole life but didn't get into the designer scene til recently. Well, more into the designer scene. First games were **monopoly** and **wahoo**. Played all the basic games as a kid like **kerplunk**, **trouble**, some amazing Frankenstein game where you trying to wake up his monster by finding plastic parts and sticking them into him and then pulling a lever to see if you could wake him up and win (please someone find this game because it was amazing at least thematically). And then my first real entry into designer games was **Carcasonne** that my friends dad owned and loved. 
Well I was checking kinja deals one day, and there was a big sale on Amazon on board games. So I just clicked on it to see what games were even available. I was expecting the stuff that you already see at Walmart and Target. There was so much more, things I hadn't imagined being games. So I go through reading all the reviews trying to narrow it down, because I think if I buy one good game that will give us something to do that's a nice change of pace. So I'm narrowing down by reading reviews and then I get on YouTube to help decide between the final 3 or 4. About a million one hour top ten lists by the dice tower later, and here we are.

My collection includes

Blood rage
Imhotep
Roll for the galaxy
Small world plus expansions
Shadowrun crossfire
Jaipur
Tides of madness
Smash up which I regret
Betrayal at house on the hill plus widows walk
King of tokyo plus expansions
King of new York
Liars dice
Pandemic
Castles of Burgundy
Warhammer quest acg
Blood bowl team manager plus sudden death
Sons of anarchy men of mayhem
Terraforming mars
Flash point fire rescue plus a couple expansions
7wonders duel
Splendor
Love letter Archer edition
Roll for it (play with my 3 year olds)
Dungeon roll bundle ( for when the 3 year olds get a little older)
Claustrophobia plus both expansions
Pledged massive darkness, deep madness, and mythic battles pantheon.

Now I just need more time and more warm bodies to play boardgames with.
In college one of my friends introduced us to cosmic encounter. We played that over and over. Then we played Catan and Dominion and I was hooked, it helped that Tabletop came out very soon after that year so I was able to watch a bunch of cool board games being played by Wil Wheaton, specifically small world with Day[9] because I was a huge follower of him. 
**Ticket to Ride** followed by **Betrayal at House on the Hill**

Before playing them, I had initially thought that Board Games meant games like Monopoly, Scrabble, Snakes and Ladders. Then my college mate decided to host a Board Game Night and I cringed at the thought, but went anyway.

I then realized that my perception of Board Games was wrong and updated and they have indeed evolved and modernized to an amazing entertainment medium, while still retaining their social aspect.

I have since then proceeded to go on a spending spree, and now own a collection of my own.
6 to 8 hours to Eldrith Horror? Ouch! The longest game I've had was about 5 hours and that was my first game where we were learning to play. Most of the time it's 3 to 4, sometimes less if we get our butts handed to us. But I haven't played it with more than 4 investigators and don't think I ever would. That could cause it to go on that long.
>About what got you into board games and what extent your collection is, when it started to grow.

Played a few modern board games before really getting into the hobby. There were a couple of hits I enjoyed for parties, but overall, nothing that blew me away, and I outright hated a few I tried. Then I was gifted **Zombicide** and my mind was blown by the mere concept that co-op board games existed. 

I soon ended up on this subreddit because I was curious what else might be out there, which gave me an idea of some things I'd like to try out. When the bf and I heard that a game store we liked was starting up board game nights, we decided to go. We got introduced to more games and began to grow our collections. We soon found we were not getting in as much gaming as we wanted, so we began having our own monthly gaming events. 

Going to be soon 4 years since that gift and I play games at least three weekends a month. My current collection has steadly grown a great deal. Don't know the exact number since BGG lists some expansions as separate games, but it is over 100. The bf has an a similar collection as well. And of course I've played game that are in neither of our collections.

> about the games I have and your experiences with them.

**Tsuro** was one of my pre-board game obsession games. Used to take it LARPing. It doesn't see much play anymore, but I love it for what it is.

Got **Takenoko** during my first year of the hobby. I've played it online with friends more than my actual physical copy. I really like the expansion for it.

**Gloom** is alright. I enjoy it when I play it. The cards for it are one of the coolest cards out there.

**7 wonders** is one of my least favorite games. Lots of people like it, but after I got past figuring out how Science worked and what all the icons meant, the game just felt like a bunch of build up with no payoff. When it comes to drafting games in a similar vein, I am a much bigger fan of **Among The Stars**.

> Any recommendations you might have ( worth mentioning my friend has 5 tribes and that I love it a lot)

I'd recommend you first try the games you have coming and to continue to explore the games that show up at your game group. When you're fresh into the hobby, everything feels brand new and amazing and it is very easy to want to buy all the shiny things. But it helps in the long run to try and restrain yourself, especially when it comes to buying things on a whim or just because people are hyping about it. Your taste in games will refine and change as you try more things. Buying a lot of games early on will increase the chances of you having boxes that just collect dust on a shelf because you either got something that was not a good match for you or you've just moved on from.

Other than that, have fun, try as many different things as you can! And if you want to buy something you haven't tried personally, check out some reviews and play throughs for it on YouTube first.
I started out with similar gateway drugs/games.  Through childhood I had grown up with Monopoly and the Game of Life.  

Then one day someone introduced me to Catan and I was blown away.  We started playing at work on our lunch breaks, and soon I was introduced to a whole slew of games - board games, card games.  Dominion was another groundbreaking games for me.  From there I started exploring more and more games.  

My collection now is a little lengthy to list, but what I've found is that once you've found games that are at the top of their category, games that take a mechanic and polish it to almost perfection, it's hard to want to pull out a game that feels similar but doesn't do it as well. 
I've seen the expansions priced anywhere from $60 to an insane $199 - I've been on the lookout myself.

I did manage to get a copy of the base game AND Fame & Fortune for $35 shipped on eBay recently (which is a screaming deal). As such, I have an extra base game available now, but unfortunately, the expansions are the tough ones to find at a reasonable price.
I've sent you a message with some info
Which version? There have been several and I'm under the impression that they varied a lot.
I'll message you the links because I don't want scalpers to buy them. 
leisure games in finchley have an open gaming session. Not sure when, you can check their website

**Win Lose Banana** would be the quickest possible way to play 20 games.
* **Onitami** - There's a load of different learning outcomes in the "easy to learn" phase before you even get to "hard to master" phase hence it's very "moreish"/another one type of game. Just wish the actual production was a lot smaller and more travel-like design - seems they've enlarged everything to make it more expensive. But the actual game is very fun and good pace.
Quorto is a fantastic, beautiful on the table, quick game for all ages. I had it on the living room coffee table for our last big party and guests could sit down and play a few quick games to challenge themselves and others. It is a must have Game, highly recommend. 
**One Night Ultimate Werewolf** last, at most, eleven minutes and is ridiculously fun if you like lying to your friends.  Most games only last six or seven minutes, and there's so much variation game to game. 
**Koryo** is a fast set collection card game that has a bunch of special powers and upsets that make it really fun to play multiple times in a row.
Hive Pocket would be my favorite like this! I can play it back to back to back....
Skull.  (sometimes called skulls and roses) 


Fantastic game, easy bluffing/push your luck to explain. Can be played for hours, doubles as a drinking game. Amazingly fun 
* Escape
* Coup
* One Night Ultimate Werewolf
* Codenames 
* Onitama
* Hive
* Love Letter (just don't play for all seven points, that takes way too long)
* Loopin' Louie

Most all of these can play in ten minutes flat. And, it's a fairly diverse list looking at genres and player counts.

How did this go?
Well, I still think it should be a Dominant-Species-A-Thon, but hey... different strokes for different A-Thon's. 
Three minutes to go. Several interesting new donation rewards this year!
I love board games specifically because it's not a digital experience. Something like this has absolutely no appeal to me whatsoever. If I'm going to play a video game, I already have my PS4 and that can do a whole lot more than just play board games. 
2 things;    

if I'm doing things digitally and have something that handles the back end processing, there are better game experiences one can create as the technology allows. Boardgames are structured as they are because of the limitations of physical pieces. So the real potential of this is doing multi-player video games, in which case I think it would be better served to focus on that instead of inheriting the design limitations of a different medium.  

Second, I thought this was going to be a discussion on digital delivery, ala "print on demand" crossed with PnP and I thought "well now, that's an interesting idea." Hollandspiel is sort of doing that with their newest game **An Infamous Traffic** with its availability in both physical and digital kits.
The main reason I have boardgaming as a hobby is to be sitting at the table with others. I don't personally see the appeal of digital boardgames - unless I was playing with friends whilst talking on Skype, for instance. 

If no ones around and I want to play a game, I'd be reaching for a dedicated computer game.

But that's just me. Likely there is a market. The current digital tabletop platforms seem to be popular and I'm sure official implementations would go down well with that crowd. Any ideas how big that audience currently is?
The advantages you state don't do anything to offset the issues i have with the technology. It likely wouldn't lessen the cost to the end user. If you're still purchasing components and companies now have to program a digital implementation the cost will stay the same with the addition of a big ipad now. 

Also i like that board games aren't technological. If i want to take them somewhere i just pick up the box. I don't need power. 

Why people think that board gamers want their board games to be video games is beyond me. 
With cd and bluray, I agree they're replaceable since they have to be played by digital devices anyway. Boardgame to me is more about analogue experience but I can't see why they can't coexist.

P.s. A better comparison would be sth like CD vs vinyl and boardgame vs digitised boardgame.
I'm a board gamer and I'd love something like this.

It's going to happen eventually. There's a heap of studios working on some version of a digital boardgame, the current interface is to use a big TV as the centrepiece screen that runs the game and have private information controlled by a players phone and you sync up via a webpage and code.

The main issue with that implementation is you have people facing a screen rather than across a table from each other. The playtable looks to solve that. It's still early days and 24 inch isn't huge, many gameboards are much larger than that, but I don't think it's a huge problem as this is a first model. I'm certain if it's successful and adopted they'll offer much larger ones with flatter profiles.

As for everyone who doesn't care for this. Think about how many posts we get here where people complain about not getting a game to the table because setup is fiddly, or rules explanations are complex, or there's a lot of book keeping or scoring to be done between rounds, or complaints about damaged components.

This has the potential to solve all of those. Also, at gamenight I wouldn't need to bring a car boot full of games to give people options. Once the platform is relatively mature I'd imagine it being like Steam, not only could you get people playing your game with correct rules enforcement, but you could also gather data on plays automatically (logging BGG data) and also general data about how often your game is played, average play time, ratings, win rates for certain cards and strategies etc. 

Now it does have some downsides obviously, the first being that getting people to have their phones out and on for a substantial period of time is still a challenge for today's smart phones, but I suspect they could just chuck a few charging ports on the playtable as well to solve that. The second is that if you have people on their phones they are likely to get distracted and check facebook and message people etc.

I think I'll order one when I can, I'd love to see how it works and I can definitely see the potential for it to be really good.
IMO I don't think this device is going to go far.  This should've come out a solid 3-5 years ago and maybe at that point it would've grabbed the interest of a ton of new board gamers getting into the hobby.  But as it stands now, people are loving/fussing about simple little apps on phones.  To have them go 100% digital is quite a bit of a jump.

But the main reason why I think it is a bit late is because VR is right around the corner.  We are already seeing it implemented in games like **Mask of Anubis**, and it's getting great reviews.  It wouldn't shock me if board games made a huge jump to VR within the next 10 or so years to truly bridge that connection between board games and video games like **Civilization**
It's a cool idea, but I prefer physical boardgames to digital.

In an age where you are being pushed to upgrade electronic components every few years, I wonder how long this table will be supported for software updates.  My guess is a new model is released every year and anything over three years old will become a piece of legacy electronics.

I would rather grow my physical game collection (which only gets updates when I decide to make a custom insert, add custom components, or the like) rather than invest in yet another electronic device, which will likely age out of relevance before the next Presidential election.
Unless we're playing it wrong, I think you can also slot over something (i.e. get rid of a bad slot) just by playing a different colored card on top of that slot. Maybe wrong? It's not come up much, so it hasn't been a big issue. 

I love this game. It's such a chaotic blast. I really like it at 2p, with two characters each. Makes it quick and tight, with lots of cool moves to make. 
I care very little about chrome, but that unboxing was breathtaking. The inserts have better graphic, visual, and industrial design than almost all other games.
I have agreed with him on almost everything and as a result am terrified of watching this.
You should tone down that glass breaking sound effect, but otherwise nice review.
Nobody has mention if the insert supports sleeved cards anybody knows this?
Vinhos would be a hard sell for my table these days. They're starting their steady and inevitable slide towards light to medium fare. RIP heavy Euro days.
I keep finding myself interested in **Vinhos** and **Viticulture** because I just really like the theme here. I got the chance to try the new essential edition of Viticulture recently, and it was quite good, but I'm still torn on whether that plus Tuscany EE or vinhos deluxe would be the way to go. Can anyone compare the two? I think some in my group might be turned off by the card draws in Viticulture, but at the same time the bit about the wine fair adding excess complexity for the sake of being complex sounds off-putting as well. I like a good heavy game though, and sometimes a mechanical feel bothers SU&SD more than me.
This game looks very interesting but I feel I only have space for a heavy euro or two (have food chain magnate, the great Zimbabwe and Terra mystica already) if I expect them to get played...

>I've considered ashes however the dice pool for mana seems a bit too randomised. 

It isn't. You choose what dice to include and all sides of the dice are useful. Its far,  far, less random than hoping you draw basic land. 


So correct me if I'm wrong. You wan't... Magic but not Magic? You know, the LCG or TCG aspect of any game is entierely up to you. You don't have to follow the tournament meta. You can just play and enjoy the game however you want and just play with the cards/decks you have.

So or so, take a look at **Summoner Wars: Master Set**.
Netrunner. Your mana pool is credits, which you get either by giving up other actions to take them, or by playing cards to build up your account. Every turn has something you can do, because if you can't play cards, you can use your actions to draw or get more credits.
Um...Seasons is basically everything you are asking for + more.
Have you considered Mage Wars yet?  Mana exists and deck building exists however you also possess your whole deck in your hand in the form of a literal spell book you flip through.
I have not played this game, so this is a shot in the dark, but I have heard Codex described as a game for fans of Magic that don't want to have to hunt down random cards in booster packs.  I will I could offer more info, but you might want to look into it.
Look into **Codex**
Google mtg power nine cube card list, find one you like, plug all that shit into a mtg compiler website that spits out a many page PDF of all those cards printed out actual size on a grid, then take the PDF to a mom and pop small printer shop, have them print it on card stock in high def color, have them cut it into cards with their big ass cutting press, trim the cards as necessary with scissors, and finally sleeve all the cards.  Congratulations, you now have a mtg cube containing the most fun cards there ever were, to draft from with buddies.  I paid about $300 canadian for mine (quality sleeves aren't cheap) and I couldn't be happier with it.

Edit: if you really like mtg like it sounds you do, nothing in this thread is going to scratch that itch the same way MTG would.  I know that because I'm the same way.  Trust me on this when I say it's best to just bite the bullet and invest into printing out a power nine cube. It is fun. As. Hell.
**allegiance** has the good play part of magic. It's quite interesting we play it as a filler all the time. But it hasn't drafting, but it might be worth looking up for you though. 
Epic is an option, but you probably already know it if you have payed star realms and hero realms. You can play Epic in constructed mode offering a deck building experience.
I owned Allegiance and I was a mtg player for 20 years! It's the most similar game I've encountered to mtg

You also have **imperial settlers**
If you haven't play Race for the Galaxy, it can be really fun to draft. There is a draft variant that helps you specialize and make a deck. You get your mana in your planets you place. 
As you mentioned, MtG Cube!

I was the same as you, gave up on standard and didn't want to invest big bucks into a modern deck (I like variety and want to change my deck up all the time so it would cost a bomb). So! I built a cube as you said. I tend to go to all the pre-releases and draft regularly enough and this alone provides a decent amount of cards to do a small cube for each set that I can draft over and over again.
Arctic Scavengers. Hands down. 
The Spoils: Decade of Deckadence

Designed for the cube format with the best cards of the decade.
It has dice but Star Wars destiny comes out dec 1 and looks really really good
"party Cthulhu game"....  WHAT?!
I really enjoyed this video! Ambiguity is the winner of the day!
This is a pretty long standing annoyance that has hit multiple print runs of all their expansions in various ways. I have an early print of Lost Legion that mostly matches component-wise, but I'm more exception than rule. They will possibly offer to send you replacement components if you're loud enough, but there's no guarantee that they will match either. Sorry, there.
A similar thing happened with the first set of expansions for the **Pathfinder Adventure Card Game**. At some point they switched printers but kept the packaging virtually identical. [The new cards can be spotted a mile away](http://i.imgur.com/9axUdQg.png) and the change in size means they clump together when shuffled.

I hope WizKids can do something to help you out. Paizo wasn't interested in my problems with Pathfinder.
I think the lesson to all is don't support companies that do this.  I've stopped buying Dominion after they did this a couple of expansions ago. 
You know what, fuck this game. I'm gonna sell or donate my copy of the core game and move on.

Wiz Kids is a terrible company.
That sucks so much. Wiz kids has been a pretty crappy company for a while, so that doesn't surprise me that much. Sorry to hear, dude :(
I love Mage Knight, from solo to 4 player I've played countless times and I bought Lost Legions a long time ago and luckily the components mostly matched.

In saying that I will never purchase a Wizkids product ever again based on how terrible their component quality was for the game and its expansions.
They won't replace the hex tiles unless they're majorly jacked up, but the cards/tokens they should replace if mis-sized. The Tezla expansion specifically they'll replace almost all the components. You just go to their website for WizKids product replacement and put in a ticket for a replacement for the Tezla manual and they'll include the other components (not hex tiles). They only do this up to 90 days from purchase though.
Where did you order it from? Wondering if I should try to get it somewhere quick before this run replaces it or wait until a new one fixes it.
I just bought Lost Legion and was horrified by the disparity in the color of the brown tokens and all the land tiles. They are SO far off.

My card deck had a line pressed into the edge as well making them distinguishable from the core set. 

I contacted WizKids and they did respond saying that I could put in a replacement package, but that the colors were within the tolerance.

This response seemed contradictory, but I'm going to submit a package and see what happens.

Incredibly frustrating to say the least. How can so many companies get the expansions spot on for years from the base set release and WizKids can't seem to get consistency in back to back prints?
I used clear fantasy flight sleeves and I don't notice any difference unless i'm looking for it in the cards. As for replacements from them I was super impressed that they sent me a new rule-book cards and tokens for the tezla expansion. It even came with a few bonus tokens.
So I appreciate the warning, but it's not as if anyone has any control over such things.

I think I've even seen that the encounter discs are a slightly different size.

So my point being we would either accept risk and order anyway, or don't accept risk and not order.

If the risk is accepted then we get the expansions that are flawed, or not, and if flawed, might by corrected by WizKids, or not.

Still, updates are welcome.  Best of luck with it.  I'm in the market for expansions myself.  I don't know how important this issue is for me, because I may make the PnP dwarf character, so I will also have issues with consistency.
I get bad request - invalid home name when I click the link.
Is there any way to purchase these games? 
**Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 – ?** and the COIN series are good historical political/war games in the same vein.


Congratulations, I was lucky enough to also meet someone at my Meetup group this year who enjoys these types of games as well. We've really enjoy **13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis** which is similar to **Twilight Struggle** but plays in a much shorter time frame and I think there's enough a difference between the two to own both. We also recently tried **Sekigahara** and while it's not really similar to either of the games you mentioned we both really enjoyed out first play; it's a block war game that uses card management to dictate the battles.
1960 is getting a reprint soon ( [made the cut](https://www.gmtgames.com/s-2-p500.aspx) )
1960, 1989, Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage, Washington's War, Polis, Hellenes, Hearts and Minds: Vietnam 1965-1975.
1960 is really weak in comparison to TS and WSDV (in my opinion of course).  Stick w/those there's still tons more to explore.

Flylicepick recommended some solid ones as well.  Polis is a very interesting game but it's ancient history so you're not going to get much politic'ing out of it but the war/euro gameplay is fantastic
**COIN**. Cuba Libre and Falling Sky especially.

They aren't *best* with two players, but I still think they're great. If you can get four players for a game, the COIN series is probably the best gaming experiences I've ever had.
The **COIN** series might do it, or maybe **Polis: Fight for the Hegemony** if you are into ancients. And of course the TS follow-ups like **1989** or the upcoming **Imperial Struggle**. Maybe some of the more classic CDGs like **Washington's War** or the newly reprinted and extended **Labyrinth: War on Terror** if you want something present day themed.
Paths of Glory is a 2 player version of WW1, and one of the highest-rated war games of all time. 
Oh wow they released it, I PnP'd it a few months ago because it looked cool but haven't had the chance to try it yet.
The secret cabal guys mentioned it in their latest podcast...seemed to really like it.
I was interested in KS'ing it since it sounded novel and interesting.  The artwork's combination of hyper-realistic riot police and cartoony characters was a major turnoff and I never got a very good explanation for that decision.  

I'd still like to play it, but it's not one for me to buy.
I played it last week.  It's sort of a mix of Pandemic and Dead of Winter to me.  I'd definitely play it again as we played on the easiest difficulty with full cooperation since we were learning. We didn't really have any difficulties winning. i agree $60 might be a bit too much, I'd probably grab a copy myself around $40.
More details please. Very interested in how I can use this when teaching. Samples? 
Totally agree here. I give technical presentations and videos regularly and teaching board games has helped develop those skills (and vice versa).
There's a whole [start with why](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action#t-21170) thought that suggests great leaders go "why, how, what". 

Sounds like you're headed in the right direction.
It's a breakdown of the power values found on combat cards.
Damnit I was hoping on Macao.
Very exciting news!! I hope the Castles of Burgundy expansion is available outside of purchasing Notre Dame though.
Fun!  Notre Dame is a great game from the early years of modern gaming.  I have a feeling newer players are going to gobble this one up.
This is great news. I have an English copy of Notre Dame, but I've been hunting In The Year Of The Dragon for some time. It's the last Feld I need for my collection. I mean... insofar as you ever "need" a boardgame.
I'm just hoping they can get the licensing issues sorted in time for 20th Anniversary for Puerto Rico. Anyways, I'm jumping on these two hard.
I passed on Notre Dame when it was out originally. Never got a copy used like I planned.  I think I will grab the reprint.
Notre Dame is really cool. I love the geometry of how the board scales for more players. 
I've been wanting Notre Dame for years, now I finally get a crack at it!
In The Year of the Dragon a.k.a. The Game Where One Mistake May Kill You In Turn 2.
I hope they have the original box art!
WSIG: Notre Dame or First and Goal?
Great news. I've been wanting to play both of those. 
Bah, and I just bought the German language version of Notre Dame!  
I'm convinced this was leaked somewhere, as I've been tracking ItYotD and finally found a deal good enough to jump on. Lesson learned I guess!

Edit: Deal was on Sunday.
Excellent. I've played and enjoyed a friend's copy of Notre Dame and I've considered importing it from Amazon.de a few times, now I don't have to.
awesome news! thanks
i don't mind dull looking games - for instance, i really like the visuals of Castles of Burgundy. Notre Dame, however doesn't just look dull, it looks hella ugly. I can look past that if the game is fun. Does the gameplay of ND far outweigh its lacking presentation?
the list of places its available is here http://stonemaiergames.com/games/tuscany/tuscany-essential-edition/
Purchased mine from a local online store here in NZ and it arrived yesterday. Came with free promo Special Workers too. Looking forward to playing tonight!
I haven't seen it in my FLGS either, so I just went ahead and ordered it from Cool Stuff Inc this week.
Cool Stuff has it in stock, I picked up my pre-order yesterday.
Worth picking up if I have V:EE currently being shipped to me?
It was new in my FLGS just today. 
I ordered mine online so it should be here Wednesday.  Just played viticulture essential edition and looking forward to the bigger board and extras
Picked up mine last week at Miniature Market. 
As someone who contributes, and you may not be able to answer this, but what are your thoughts on the Alpha move vs doing kickstarter, indie-go-go, etc?

Between aesthetic of the miniatures, ease of painting and construction or play-ability of the army, which is the most important for you when choosing an army for miniature wargameing.  I sometimes find myself being drawn to certain factions by how cool the miniatures are and how much fun they are to paint only to find out that they are almost unplayable in the actual game.  
Painting questions

What is your favorite secret weapon (e.g. a certain brand of matte medium, particular shade of wash, oddball product or technique most don't use, etc...)?

Who or what have you studied to help improve how you highlight your minis to emulate a light source?  Also, could apply to how you choose the direction of your light source for minis.

Lastly, if money were no object and you had a large space in your home for a game room, how would you decorate it?

How did you get into wargaming?  Why do you think there isn't a strong female population in the wargaming community?
I never serve food at game night because I'm a cheap skate and believe game night should be a $0 expenditure for me and my friends. I serve drinks but most people don't drink. 

Please use your station as board game civilization master to convince everyone serving food is whack and to try my Manhattans and together we'll make the world a better place. Thank you.
Oh godz, please buy some proper Cthulhu dice. Btw. great text. Do you role-play when playing AH? We tried once to role-play while playing Eldritch and was great.
Very nice retelling!  Minor rules thing - clue can't spawn on a gate containing a location so Sister Mary's "miracle" wouldn't have happened.  Only way to get a clue to her in the base game would be to have someone go to her location and give her Research Materials or a book she could read for clues (like the Old Journal).  The rules aren't the clearest - everyone who plays AH gets something wrong in each of their first dozen plays.
Race? Or an unofficial Roll variant (of which there are several)?
I think it's well know for being insanely difficult, so you're not alone. 
I've yet to figure out how to successfully pursue a Consume strategy against the robot, since it seems to only increase its economy...
I really hate it.

It punishes you for what smokes a newer player (heavy produce/consume strats), even if you build up a brilliant engine it'll spit in your face.  

To be fair, I can fully understand why Lehman would want to do that.  In its own way it kind of feels like an admittance of "yeah that's a pretty solid ass way to win, might as well make the solo player work on something else" but even to that extent, those strategies have never translated well to human vs. human play.
**Dungeon Solitaire: Tomb of the Four Kings**
Standard solitaire is the king for a reason.
Onirim is pretty decent, it can be played solo or with a partner, but it comes with like 7 expansions and is overall a nice combination of strategy, luck, and decent challenge.  The expansions also add a nice amount of replayability.  One warning though: there is a literal ton of shuffling.
Kemps is good for a group of four

James bond is good for 2 people

Spoons works for 3-8 people 

Solitaire is good for 1 player

**Onirim**, **Urbion** and **Sylvion** are my go-tos. Runner up: **Friday**
Have you played Lords of Waterdeep with them? I think thats a good 5p game that works well with beginners near TTR ish level ish.

And if you want something different, look into Mysterium.

You all might enjoy **Codenames**. This year's Spiel des Jahres / "Game of the Year" winner. It works really well with the 5-8 player count. Lots of fun for everyone.

Another thing that would work well for your group is **Pandemic** - a cooperative game where you're trying to eradicate diseases from a plague-ridden world. The base game plays only 4 players, so you'll need the **On the Brink** expansion to add a 5th player. 
""Broom Service"" plays up to 5 and has a great balance between player interaction and strategy. I think it'd only be slightly "heavier" than TTR -- lots of laugher! It also won the Spiel de Jahres last year. 

""Hansa Teutonica"" is my favorite game and it plays GREAT at 5 players, has a good amount of strategy AND player interaction. Can be slightly mean at times, but because of the rules structure it's never back-breaking and happens so much no one can be truly offended. 

""Concordia"" is the heaviest of the 3 main recommendations, but it's not too bad either, outside of the basic rules, after you explain the initial starting hands you can basically start playing. 

""Fabled Fruits"" is a new one I enjoy, just came out, easy to teach. 

**Sushi Go!** is a cute and family-friendly drafting game.

**Seven Samurai** is a simple yet challenging cooperative game for 1-7 players.

**Tokaido** is a zen yet very cutthroat set collection game about competing to have the most fulfilling vacation.
In the beginning it said 'Games under $25', then goes with Pandemic $48, Expansion to Dead of Winter $42, and so on. Also putting 'Monopoly' on the list is quite risky. 
As a different list, here are the top 5 games customers have asked and would be our biggest sellers if I had enough of them:

1)  Watch Ya Mouth Adult version/regular version

2)  Speak Out

3)  Cards Against Humanity

4)  Exploding Kittens

5) (distant 5th) Codenames



I am just so glad a Vlaada game got into the mainstream in my area :)   We have been trying everything possible to subtly sneak it into mainstream since you can't tell the other 90% of people that Codenames might be a good game.


Anyone else notice she said "crabs against humidity" but the box says "crabs adjust humidity."
Gotta love the Tilt Shift lens to make all the games look smaller than they actually are. 
Can't spell ignorance without IGN.
It's a fast simple game but, very deep that plays 6 players. And it's extremely good especially with the no investor card variant. 
Imperial is a fantastic game about investing and managing those investments... and they just happen to be war bonds that allow you to control the fighting during World War I. You don't play the countries, you play war profiteers and take control of the countries.

It's simple to learn, but has a lot of depth in decisions. You have to balance the physical space of the map, the shifting alliances of a war, the sneaky purchases of stock, and the timing of income and payouts. Keeping it all organized is a great challenge, especially with the "no investor card" variant, which requires you to keep a sharp watch on the cash reserves of the other countries and players and issue bonds at the perfect moment.
Interested in hearing more about these. I love Concordia and Antike II.

Normally I'm not too bothered by the Dice Tower lists, but compared to their thematic games list, this one is kind of a let down. 4 Gateway games (Small World, Citadels, Dominion, even Quadropolis), a couple of the new hotness games and just a couple of oddball picks. Just odd.
Citadels feels out of place in this list. Also, City of Spies is very underrated.
I thought they were listing stuff that's in-print/available. Is Inis still on shelves anywhere, what with the supply problems?
[Dexterity game mega review by actualol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yim5LbD2E6g)

Here's a review that covers lots of games.

Personally, I'd recommend from the video:

 Coconuts - There's also an expansion to go up to 6! I don't know how much mileage this'll get, but I've played it about 15-20 times over the last 6 months and I've enjoyed it everytime.

 Riff Raff - Giant wooden pirate ship! Wow! Also has a nice hand management aspect and predicting your opponents cards. LOTS of tension.

Via Paletti - Thinky dexterity game. Building a tower, using pieces from lower levels of the tower. LOTS of tension. Might be a bit much for a 5 year old.

These are some other games, though they might not work for the kids or just a small group:

Dimension - Race to stack colored balls based on rule cards. Seems easy, quickly realize how many rules you have broken, realize you are trash

Brick Party - Competitive Speed Lego Building Dexterity Goes up to 9! Split up into teams of two. One person explains how to build, the other person builds. There are rule cards to make it more interesting i.e. builder cant use thumbs, the explainer cant look at the structure. Very fun, give it a round or two and most people pick it up. 

And finally God Tier Game:

Loopin Louie - This game really has no business being so great. But it is
You could try a modified ruleset for **Rampage** aka **Terror in Meeple City**.
"Wonky" might be one to look at. 
**Dungeon Fighter** is a challenging and very fun coop dexterity game! 
Tok Tok or Click Clack or Bling Bling whatever version you can find, is fun, but probably going to get old quick, too. I just bought Click Clack Lumberjack last night, and it's good to play once or twice, so like 10-20 minutes. It is kinda similarish to Jenga, but feels shorter, and better because you get to swing a tiny axe.

I have Flick 'Em Up, and it has actual scenarios in the book to play through. My wife really likes it a lot, but our kid is just turning 4 and too young for it. It's fun.

Ice Cool seems the simplest/fastest to set up and is next on my list of dexterity games to buy. I like that you can work on trick shots and build your skill in the game.
I dunno dude I think you have the best dexterity games that exist.  Crokinole is pure skill.  Junk Art is a blast of variety and laughs. Dexterity games your preferred games to play w/your children or just working on expanding that particular aspect of your collection?
The Dice Tower just posted a (47 minute) [video on this topic](https://youtu.be/kqUbvTfXnLM) recently. 
Definitely **Tobago** from Bruce Allen. It came out 7+ years ago and that's the only thing he ever got published. It's a very unique, enjoyable and beautiful game (if a little too luck dependent).
Starting with the premise that a "hit" is something in the ballpark of the top 300 on BGG, and that it is stupid to label someone a one hit wonder only a year or two after their hit came out, here are some designers with a single top 100 game released multiple years ago that have never had a hit since:

* Klaus-Jürgen Wrede - Carcassonne

* William Attia - Caylus

* Urs Hostettler - Tichu

* Jacques Bariot, Guillaume Montiage - Kemet

* Ted Raicer - Paths of Glory

* Andreas Steding - Hansa Teutonica

Elizabeth Magie.

Her board game as it stands today (Monopoly, originally The Landlord's Game) may suck, but it's incredibly well-known and her only major game creation.
You can't get more one-hit-wonder than Klaus Teuber. Everyone has heard of **Catan**. Pretty sure nobody knows if he ever did anything else.
[Endeavor](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33160/endeavor) - that game is fantastic but I don't think the designers have done anything else.
Kasper Aagaard was a co-designer on Merchants and Marauders. He's done nothing since (not even the M&M expansion)

His partner on the game did do Clash of Cultures but nothing new since 2012
David Watts created the crayon rail genre.

Francis Tresham did (Advanced) Civ. Oh, and Spanish Main. (I have actually played it, once.)

Harold Vanderbilt (Bridge) is credited with nothing else.

Allan B. Calhamer, Jacques Johan Mogendorff. Seems in olden times game designer was less of a profession, and games were built around an idea someone had.


Cry Havoc
My experiences:

Ebay - Slowest sell unless it's a hot product, cleanest process, chance to get a good price. Ebay takes a cut.

Reddit - First person will tell you your price is crazy and lowball the shit out of you, second person is reasonable if your price is reasonable. Pretty sell rate for hot and non-hot games. Shipping can be a deal breaker, try to combine games. Great for local transactions.

BGG - All over. Some people lowball the shit out of you, others won't. Overall, pretty good place to get money because gamers understand game values. Some people want 1,000 pictures of condition and then still complain when they get it. Verified accounts make it easy to find sellers/buyers with good reputations. BGG takes a cut.
local facebook trade group, I'm a UK wide one which works pretty well
Craigslist is good. 
I've only used the Reddit board game bazaar to sell games, and it works fine for me. Each month you just post your list and then just wait for people to message you. Could take a few hours or a few months. Then you just come to an agreement with the guy.

Of course, this method is way better if you're looking to trade games, which is what I primarily do. Also, it takes a while, so if you need money asap then you might need to try something else (though, I would bet if you posted your games at a wicked low cost, people would show interest pretty quickly on the bazaar.)
I've picked up a used game on reddit. It was a great deal. Would buy from reddit user again assuming I can arrange someone to pickup avoiding shipping fees. 
Selling that many games, it's a good idea to order a bunch of Regional Rate boxes from USPS.com. They're free, come in bundles of 20 (I think), and they're much cheaper than flat rate in many cases, and almost always at least a bit cheaper. If you ship through PayPal, you can save a couple bucks too. Every bit you can save on shipping is more money that can be paid for your games.
eBay is probably faster. Also, post on r/boardgameexchange.
I literally didn't even know you could sell games on bgg, so probably not nearly so many buyers there add on eBay. 
If you live in a decent sized city look on Facebook to see if you have any groups for buy/sell/trade, those work the best.
I sell on Amazon and have used eBay in the past. Amazon charges a little more in fees but it's better if you want to undercut and sell at a fixed price. If your willing to risk an auction format on eBay with the possibility of selling close to what you'd sell for at a fixed rate on Amazon then eBay is preferred. Personally I like the guaranteed fixed sale price of Amazon vs the worry of selling on eBay for dirt cheap and pulling in low profit due to high shipping (I just sold Roma by Queen games shipped USPS from KS to NJ and it was $9 for cheapest, and  Roma is a light weight game! Imagine selling a hefty deckbuilder).
FLGS (if they allow you to sell) => eBAY => BGG => Reddit. This is my tier list.
I would love to see more used games for sale on eBay.
I use craigslist.  I could probably get a bit more if I sold games online, but I like the simplicity of it.
i use craigslist and another site called "Kijiji" to post sale items. It's a great way to sell because you don't have to deal with shipping and fees.

in my experience, shipping costs from Canada on large and/or heavy items (like boardgames) kills the sale.
Do you have a list for what you are planning on selling? 
Normally I'd recommend local for boardgames, as due to their weight and size shipping can be a big surprise. If you need to do BGG (my first choice of other options), make sure to factor in shipping and don't take it all on yourself.
Local is always best. Specially, because eBay takes 10% and you have to price low enough to be interesting and cover shipping. You get way more money out of local. However, the downside is that you get less exposure and your games may just sit for a bit. 
BGG picks up ebay orders, yea? And BGG's audience is limited. Ebay's audience is not limited. So, list it on ebay.
I'd be interested in seeing a list. If you have some of the things I'm looking for, I could maybe work something out with you before I have my big student loans kick in on me. 
I've used the bgg geek market pretty effectively. It's fairly easy to set up and you can fire and forget. Ebay works as well.
How much play testing goes into a game like this? On average how many iterations of a game do you go through before you get all of the mechanics "dialed in"?
Hey, I have not played Hounded, but it looks great. I like the geometric look of the game. Did that factor in to the design of the meeple?  Or did the the design of the meeple require a minimalist look? 
Do you play test with your cats? do they try to cheat?  what do you do when you play test with your significant other and they cheat a bit because "we are all new and learning the rules"?   

Do you guys look at game ideas submitted by amateur game makers? What is the worst game you have seen?
I have had the opportunity to play Hounded and I knew it was my kind of game right away.  So a big congratulations on the release!  

Should you design for yourself, or should you design for your audience?

What side is your favorite; Hound or Hunter and Why?

What game is your current obsession?

Thanks!





  
I LOVED GLOOM AFTER I SAW IT ON TABLETOP! <3 <3 <3

**Kyla**  

Any talks to feature another Atlas game on Tabletop?

So if I want a job like yours do I need to be extremely lucky, know a guy who has an in, get a get a degree in some obscure field like "game design", or a perfect storm of all 3?

**Clint** 

Is Hounded the only game you are/were working on?  

How long after you started did it take you to get to where it is now?

Any random advice to someone who has ideas of game development in their head but has no idea where to start?

**Both** 

What are some mechanics to other games that you find the most creative and/or interesting?

Has anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like? 

If you could set up your ultimate gaming session and play a tabletop game with anyone in the history, living or dead, what game would you choose and who would you play it with?

Most wanted things on your Christmas list? I NEED IDEAS!!! :)


Are you able to resist biting into a Tootsiepop?
oooh now that's a great theme.
I've found that groups that like Coup usually enjoy Sheriff of Nottingham - lots of bluffing in both.
Splendor 


Sheriff of Nottingham

I would also try Pandemic 
If Resistance is working, I think you could try **Deception: Murder In Hong Kong**.  It's been a hit with my group, plays quickly yet leaves you with a feeling of having played a nice, full game after each play.
**Istanbul** really does sound like exactly what you want. I think it's a great medium weight game with a different win condition than usual for Euros: racing to gather rubies instead of amassing an more victory points.

Also **Five Tribes** is a bout an hour as well. I personally like **Istanbul** better because it rewards long term planning where **Five Tribes** is more about reacting to the move your opponent just did. **Lords of Waterdeep** is also possibly doable in an hour if people don't dawdle.

EDIT: grammar
I like **Kingdom Builder** quite a bit. It's pretty low-stress, and can be played very casually or pretty competitively. Variable victory conditions help replays stay interesting.
I would take a look at **Isle of Skye**. Initially I dismissed it as I thought it would be too similar to Carcassonne. I don't own vanilla Carc but had played the iOS version somewhat and wasn't that taken with it (I did end up buying Star Wars Carc as that was a better fit for me). 

Isle of Skye turned out to be one of those 'gems'. The 'selling' round makes all the difference for me.

"Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested."

It's a really clever inclusion that makes this tile-laying game even more interesting - with a little agonising over what price to set your tiles at.

It also has lots or re-playability due to the use of random scoring tiles. This mixes things up and each game is different and leads to different tactics and strategies. Plays with 2-5 in 30-50mins. Pretty perfect as something to play before the main game.
I would also take a look at **Chicago Express** as a departure from Ticket to Ride. This is a more business oriented game where the player with the most money wins. This is a pure strategy game with no luck, in as much as, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.

A session of Chicago Express is played over a maximum of 8 rounds. In each round, the players take turns choosing one of three available actions: auctioning a share of one of the railroad companies; expanding the rail system of one of the railroad companies; develop one of the boards hexes. Of each of those actions only a limited number is available.

As soon as all available actions of two options are taken, a dividend phase is executed, where all players gain income from the railroad companies they have shares of. After this dividend phase, the number of actions is reset and a new round begins. Plays 2-6 in 60mins.
Mission: Red Planet - This was the first game that came to mind. It's an action selection/hand management/territory control game about colonizing Mars and collecting minerals (VPs). Players have the same cards, the strategy is in what order you play them and where you send your guys. Plays best with 5-6 players if your group likes constant conflict. 10 rounds and simultaneous-ish turns makes it much quicker than the 90 minutes it says on BGG. I'd say 45-60 for 5 players who know how to play. One of my favorite games.

7 Wonders - I've only played once but it went super fast after we got through the rules. Drafting game with simultaneous turns. There's plenty of coverage on this game online though and everyone else could probably say it better than I could.

Small World - Simple territory control game with tons of replay value. If you enjoyed Risk at any point in your life, you'll like Small World. Only thing that slows this game down and might make it push that time limit is having to check the reference sheets. That goes away after about 3 or 4 plays.

Alhambra/Granada - The simplest of all of these and almost as fast as 7 Wonders. Super simple tile laying/city building-ish game. This is another with plenty of videos online that could sum it up better than I can.

Fire & Axe - This one can go longer than you're looking for but still worth mentioning. Look it up if you don't have a hard 60 minute limit.

Edit: Formatting
I really like Istanbul a lot, but I will point out that setting up can get annoying. There are many elements that need to be fiddled with and sorted. Isle of Skye is a much better option IMO.
Edit:

Misread that tile somehow haha

I would say Indigo, Castles of burgundy, Broom service ABC
Honestly, if you are already in for Mega Man, I'd wait for that and see if you even like it enough to go in on the original-flavor sets.  Personally, I love Mega Man, but pretty sure I will be passing on the KS, as I own PT1 and it simply fell flat for my wife and I.  That is not to say it is a bad game: it is certainly interesting, but know that it is not for everyone.  

As for the sale, PT is not that expensive in the first place, and barring some promos, it is pretty easy to get your hands on, but if you really want to get your feet wet, PT1 (or Deluxe) is as good a place as any to start.
My suggestion would be the deluxe copy, admittedly I don't own it but I've heard good things. Other than that, you can't go wrong with picking up the first set (I have 1+2, but 1 is plenty to get you started).
I have 1 and 5. I recommend going with 1 first. As far as I know, deluxe is good for an introduction, too.

The point is, the game was throwing information at your face from the very first set, and the ones after that added even more rules. So 1 or Deluxe would be my recommendation.
I got Deluxe on Amazon for $18. Haven't played yet, but it's worth watching them for the price. 
I got Pixel Tactics Deluxe via the kickstarter and ended up with Pixel Tactics 5 as a bonus. It's definitely a game that can get overwhelming with possibilities, so stick with Deluxe or 1 for your first set. They are still deep with possibility but far more digestible, which means they will hit your table more often.
**Fabled Fruit** is a great, light, gateway/family weight worker placement game with recipe filling.  It plays 2-5 and should be playable by anyone 8+.  My 3 kids are 9-14 and all picked it up very quickly.  

I can't really compare it to another card game.  The game as a healthy dose of interactivity, has some press your luck as well as more traditional place your worker get a reward kinds of actions.  

The "Fabled" mechanic keeps the game really fresh and I can imagine having no issue resetting and starting from scratch once we get through the decks.

This is a great game for families, for casual gamers, for any gamer who wants a lighter, quicker game for a game night.  It's relatively small so it will travel well ( especially if you forgo the box ) making it great for vacations, work, etc.

I am a big euro gamer and enjoy everything from **Worlds Fair: 1893** up to **The Gallerist** and **Vinhos**.  This game is going to get a lot of plays at our house.  


So I was watching the Drive Thru Review of this one and I was just wondering where it leads. On the surface it just feels like Caylus played out over 100+ turns. Does the evolving card options really make that big of a deal? How is this better than just using a randomizer at the start of each game?

If this sounds negative I don't mean to be. I genuinely just don't understand how this is superior to random set up. 
I'll be the dissenting voice. I played Fabled fruit at Essen and liked it well enough. Played it again (until 25, I believe) a couple days ago, and it fell completely flat for me and my group. Now, admittedly, we were all "gamers" and probably are not the target audience, but when we played, it felt very mechanical, and kind of soulless. I never had the feeling that I was making interesting choices, and individual games were over so quick that it often came down to luck of the draw/ random turn order who won. Even when there was some "take that", it just felt emotionless to me. I personally would be interested in check get out the other cards, but honestly, if I just read through them once, not playing them, it probably wouldn't hamper my enjoyment at all.
In Canada this game costs $40+ dollars...
But really this game is just a lot of cards right?  lol

I do want this game.. 
For those that have played, how would the game work with six players (utilizing the start player marker for an additional player). Would that break some of the card abilities? 
Status on FFG site is "Awaiting Reprint" which means:

This product is currently out of stock at FFG. We are planning to reprint this title, but a date for additional production has not yet been set.
> Does anyone know if TI3 is going out of print for good or something?

the core set just had a new print run released in the last 2 months so it's not dead.

FFG's production queue is massive as they have several lines of products with multiple games, each with a constant flow of new expansions.  TI3 reprints are really low on their list of priorities compared to pumping out new stars wars minis and arkham games
It's out of print, and in high demand after they reprinted the base game set, as it fixes/adds a lot of aspects of the game. It's a phenomenal game, but the Shattered Empires expansion makes everything better, so most people buying TI are going to want Shattered Empires.

Shards of The Throne doesn't have the 'requisite' status that Shattered Empire, so I'd have to imagine that's why it isn't hard to find like Shattered Empire.
http://www.cravingforagame.ca/products/Twilight_Imperium_Shattered_Empire_Expansion-1250-0.html

One copy here.  $69.95
I recently snagged a copy on coolstuffinc.com for a really good price. I think they were low on stock when I got mine but it's worth checking to see if they have any left 
Out of the two expansions available, this is the one that does the most to remedy the base game's shortcomings. Namely, the removal of the 1 VP tile, which is silly, but it's the preferred expansion by far.
I have Ti3 game, Shattered empire exp,  but can't find shards of the throne exp. Australia have some copies but they don't do international shipping (to europe). Also amazon have some copies for ~~150$. Shards isn't add much vital stuff to the game but it's TI3's stuff so... I-NEED-IT
Given the games you've mentioned, I'm curious about your playercount and.. well, what you're looking for in games in-general.  

In my experience, the SDE games are most fun with more than two players.  Legends tacks on a co-op mode and campaign and a bunch of other stuff so you can play it solo or two players, but I've enjoyed it more with three or four players.  Also, the SDE stuff will have you wanting to paint them.  The models look great, but having a pile of monocolored plastic out there will look bland.  Gameplay is a very light RPG, essentially looking at Gauntlet in board-game form.

On the other hand, Battlelore and Claustrophobia are both strictly 2-player versus affairs.  Claustrophobia will actually be close to 2-player versus SDE, but won't have the co-op options.  They're also very different games - one is a relatively evenly matched strategy battle game, and the other is a dungeon crawl.

All three are good games, so it's hard to make a judgement call without knowing more about your situation.  

If you play a lot of RPGs, then the SDE figures may find themselves being used for your various RPG campaigns.  If you were really looking forward to painting them, then that would be another reason to go for SDE.  If you ever plan on having 3 or more players, then it's the only option from all of them presented above. 

If you only have two players, though, then the latter deal would likely be the better option.  You would have more gameplay variety with two different games, and both would be things designed -specifically- for that player count.  Plus, both of them have some miniatures that, while they would look nice painted, don't seem to *need* it quite as much.

On a personal note, I'll add that while I own everything SDE-related, it's not a game that's gotten a lot of demand to get back to the table.  The opinions above are based solely on SDE and SDE: Forgotten King.  We're waiting on the campaign mode for Legends to actually start playing it again, as I hope that re-sparks interest in it.
Another thing to keep in mind is that SDE:Legends is delayed until Spring 2017 at the earliest.  Depending when they finish up and get things in production, there is a good chance that its going to be delayed further by the CNE, when all the factories shut down for the month of Feb.  Add in shipping times after everything is completed, I would not be surprised if it was closer to mid summer before it is released.
I believe the correct answer is Go. 
**Concordia** has a single page rulebook. Add in all the expansion maps and you've got a huge amount of replay-ability.

**BattleCON** has a huge rulebook but is actually pretty simple, especially if done progressively as suggested. Lots of fighters and lots of strategy.
Hive. Easily compared to chess, which we all know fits this bill to a T
**Arboretum** 
HEY OTHELLO!!
I played five tribes tonight for the first time. I can't say it is difficult to master yet, but I think it will be. There's so many opportunities to look over a really good move.
I dunno, but this seems like a good idea for a Dice Tower Top 10 list...
**Inis** is a new game that has very simple rules but an incredible amount of variety and depth due to the different location/card/win-condition combinations. Highly recommend!
**Go** is obviously the best answer. It's absurdly simple rules but takes at tons of dedicated practice to master.

As for modern board games, I think your question is really about how high the skill ceiling goes. Most games have a logarithmic skill curve, where you improve quickly early on and then could easily spend years refining your play to a high level.

Dominion is an especially simple example. The rules can be explained in probably 5 sentences, but high level players will win basically 100% of the games against mediocre players.
Dominion and 7 wonders come to mind. It's pretty simple to learn what all the cards and stuff do, and its pretty easy to pick a strategy involving one way to score points.


They both get really complex when you're trying to chug along multiple victory conditions.
Hive. The closest to chess that I've felt with modern boardgames
Twilight struggle
Lots of people have said Go or Chess, which are probably accurate as far as traditional games go. I'd call them sort of "lifestyle games", because you can play them for your entire life and continually learn and grow in the game. Personally, I see chess as very algorithmic and not all that interesting, but tastes vary. 

Depending on how strict you are with the "simple to learn" part, there are also many card games like this. Poker can be this way, but since it's fundamentally about lying, I'm not that interested. Bridge has a long history of being **the** game for a lot of people. I grew up with my parents playing Pinochle, and I learned Euchre, which have similar properties. If you can find a group to play with, there's no end to such games. 

For a slightly different card game, I'm an advocate for Tichu. The gameplay is more complex than, say, Hearts, but not overly so. After playing a single hand you'll basically know how to play, but playing well takes a while. Cards, so there's randomness, but consistently playing each hand well takes a lot. 
First thing that came to mind was **Ticket to Ride**.

Possible actions are very simple. Scoring only comes from three simple things. Timing and concealing your intentions against really good players, who know all the routes and the most effective ways to block, gets really complex.
Splendor! It's a very easy to learn tabletop card game, but can become extremely complex once you start paying attention to all other player's strategy, start misdirecting others, etc. Great buy for a beginner, IMO.
BattleCON, any iteration. Main entries being Devastation of Indines and War of Indines.

It's a strategy board game that emulates fighting games, and as a fan of fighting games, it emulates it spectacularly.  The board is used as the 2D stage with walls/corners.  Standard game mode features two players each using unique characters with different passive abilities and signature "styles." Styles modify common Base attacks that both players have.  The main premise is two out fight the other guy, and everyone has access to all information, nothing is hidden.

Aside from that, there are ton of different modes and ways to play in a single box.  Boss mode, team fights, dungeon crawling, and even modifications to regular play with powered up characters and attacks.

Overall I definitely recommend it, and a prime example of simple to grasp and difficult to master.  I'd be happy to answer any more questions out go more in depth into it for anyone interested.
Chess
Hanabi. It's a relatively quick cooperative game where the players try to produce the most spectacular fireworks show represented by a score from 1-25. The rules are pretty simple—a player has only three possible actions on their turn—but scoring well takes a lot of strategy and thought. My group has been playing the game for almost a year now and we only just got our first perfect 25 last weekend.
There are actually a lot of games out there like this in different genres. What other things do you enjoy about games? That could help narrow things down. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5cw008/what_heavier_modern_games_are_surprisingly_easy/
Chess.  Seriously.  This has been my hobby and addiction lately.  So much to this game.  It's amazing 
**Schotten-Totten / Battle Line** for me is the definition of simple to learn, difficult to master (other than Go, of course). Come to think of it,  all of Knizias classics qualify.
I've always thought **Twilight Struggle** was the poster child for that (besides the obvious ones like Chess and such). There are like four things you can do each turn, but the question is what you want to do, where you want to do it, and which card you want to use.
Many would disagree with me, but I'm gonna recommend Race for the Galaxy. It may take a bit to get used to, but I feel the structure is really elegant. And it's got a great theme. Each game feels like a story.

It's got a high skill ceiling and it's best with 2 players. It's my flair for a reason!
I think Puerto Rico is a pretty classic example of this as it involves a lot of tight tactics to get the upper hand on your opponent's, but is still fairly straightforward to pickup.
I'm a big fan of Antike Duellum, where there are three actions to gain resources, three actions to spend them, one action to move/fight, and a Chess-like depth to what strategies there are. And, speaking of Chess, it would be hard not to mention Hive, which is a fantastic abstract; learn how the pieces are placed and move, and you could potentially play the game for the rest of your life nad never master it's intricacies.

I'm actually surprised by you mentioning Summoner Wars. I don't think it's necessarily a complex game, but getting a grasp of all the phases and how they work is tougher than a game like Go or Backgammon, and that doesn't include the individual cards themselves. It's not a game I would have called easy to learn. Not hard, but definitely not easy.
While not the simplest game to learn because of the iconography, **Race for the Galaxy** is definitely deep and takes time to master, I still feel I haven't tried everything in this game.

One of the more recent games that I got and I feel it will take time to master is **Evolution: Climate**, it is very simple and intuitive to learn.
Cosmic Encounter. There is legit strategy to that game and learning your opponents and their abilities, when to ally, when to go solo. Man such a great game. 
I think people have been referring to chess here, as well as go. Another one to consider is poker if you are in to bluffing and playing your opponent's mind more than their cards.
Traditional board games: Go, Shogi, Chinese chess, chess (descending sort of complexity).

Modern board games: Summoner Wars, Stone Age, Agricola, Galaxy Trucker (that's all I'm playing now, there may be many more games that fits your bill).
Add **Diplomacy** to the traditional board games list.  It can be hard to find face to face groups to get the full effect, but when you do the discussion and back stabbing can be epic!  Rules are easy, but getting them to work with everyone else's orders can be interesting.
I'm going to go a different route and say diplomacy or Chinatown  the rules are simple and all the complexity is in human interactions.
**Shadowrun CrossFire** is easy to learn. But the game will kick your ass over and over again. On 15 games, I've won twice.
honestly i think i would consider poker as one. its easy to learn the rules but to master bluffing and reading other players is where the fun really begins and can take years of playing to master
**Twixt** if anyone has played that classic.  Incredibly simple rules -- connect two ends of the board together with pegs and bridges.  Place 1 peg per turn.  It's a tough one to master all the strategies.
Santorini is coming out and might fit this bill.
**Onitama** is basically a simpler version of Chess, with a cool mechanic for dictating how your pieces move.
Dominion. I can tell someone doesn't have  much experience with it when they try to say there's a lot of luck involved.
Checkers can be surprisingly deep if you play it forced jumps which is the official way. I'm a chess player but damned if checkers isn't more fun and I find more difficult. You can set up traps have come behind wins and once you get into it, you'll find yourself thinking way way ahead in moves.
I think Texas Hold'em belongs in this list.  A LIFETIME to master that game... 
How about something a bit different?  Klask.  You can lead to play in 30 seconds but dammit if you know exactly where that ball is going.  
The Riner K. game **Ingenious**, with the colored symbol tiles. Learn in minutes, but the winner being decided by each player's *weakest* color makes the entire game go from okay to great.
Las Vegas dice game 
For sale! 
**Quoridor** is the first non-cliche answer that popped into my head. All you do is either move your pawn, or place a wall. Only minor complication is you cannot place a wall that completely cuts off the board. It's on BoardGameArena, if anyone is interested in trying.

"" easy to learn hard to master ""

If I'm not mistaken it read just that on the backside of the box!
So, what's the current status on the project? When will you start rolling the versions out? 
nice. i seem to remember telling someone to make an app like this a while ago! maybe it was you i spoke to originally, maybe not! but glad someone has done the work!

will be awesome if you get it popular!
VR is going to be amazing for "tabletop" gaming.  Gaming group live across the country?  No problem!  It feels like they're right across the table.
If you are bidding on a powerplant, go for ones that will notably increase your powering potential.  Buying a powerplant in the mid-game to power one more city is a bad value proposition.  Additionally, don't be afraid to only use two of your powerplants.  Sometimes it's better value to store resources on your third instead of powering extra cities, especially as you hit diminishing returns with more cities.

Keep an eye on phase 2.  Ideally you want to activate it, and immediately take advantage of the cheapest locations.
Watch for "end game" plants and bid aggressively for them. In a game to 17, that's usually anything with 5 plus capacity (although it may vary if it looks like someone is going to push to end early). 

Watch for a bunch of high 20s/30s plants to come out early. Frequently, in mid to late step 2, the market clogs with plants nobody wants, because they only power 3 or 4 cities. Getting a much needed upgrade before this happens is crucial, because any good plant that comes out during a slump will be very expensive.

Try to manage turn order such that you buy cities before anyone who would be fighting for the same locations as you. This may mean buying fewer cities on a turn, so that the next turn you can go earlier and buy the cities you passed on, plus more that your opponents want.

If several players are one city away from starting step 2, generally you should not start it unless at least one and preferably two of these are true: your (income minus fuel) costs are less on average than anyone, you have the highest or second highest power plant, you or you can get and power 4 or more extra cities (without giving up all the extra income in connection costs). Going first in step 2 is almost always a huge advantage, so starting it (which normally means you'll go last the next turn) comes with a huge opportunity cost.
I splurge on Power Plants because I feel like the other things you spend money on have a decent rubber banding effect, but if good power plants just don't show up until phase 3 you might have enough resources and cities to power the most, but not the actual plants to power that much.

Other than that I try to end every turn with as little money as possible.
Never upgrade each power plant more than one time. That's a waste of money. 
The first power plant you bought in the game will be replaced with a new plant that powers 6 cities.
In my group, there is often a tie for 1st place. A lot of ties are broken by $5 or less, so every Elektro counts! 

Try to get the 25 or 26 as your third plant. You can usually bid a lot for these, upwards of $40. Chances are these are (although just barely) good enough to carry you to the end.

Building in the cities adjacent to the cheapest connection costs at the beginning of the game is great, but it might be a trap. Consider that you're going to be forced to spend a lot of money in connection costs later in the game when you enter step 2 and 3. Money is sometimes tighter late game than it is in the early game.

HeroQuest

Nothing but HeroQuest
Glory to rome black box. 
I'd probably go back to the late noughties and get a bunch of **Heroscape** stuff.  I'd also like a copy of **Star Wars: The Queen's Gambit**, but there wasn't really any overlap between those two.  Maybe I could pick up Queen's Gambit for an elevated, but not yet completely insane, price while getting the Heroscape stuff.
I would go back to Black and Read and buy the used copy of **Dungeon Run**, It was maybe $25. I did not know it was an Out of Print game... I think I got Firefly instead.
I would get it for these reasons, in order of importance:

1. I am a big PHG fanboy, add to my collection.

2. Summoner Wars universe. Cool!

3. I have played it since, and it is quite fun. (this maybe becomes #1)

4. It is OOP and probably worth... last I checked...

(Ha, lots of people not seeing its A STORE YOU HAVE BEEN TO IN YOUR LIFETIME. If just physical stores...)
**Warhammer Quest** with all possible content.

**Heroquest** with all possible content.

Multiple copies of everything **Heroscape**.
100% most definitely **Heroscape**. My brother and I whip it out sometimes still when I visit home (it's kept at my parents' house).

IMO the mini quality is right up there with many games today and it was painted. The game itself is very fun. It's cool coming up with different army themes and using their individual strengths.

My collection is probably about 75% complete but I'd need well over $500 to complete it at the eBay prices.
Fireball Island. 
Thank you for adding that edit.  

I'd grab Die Macher, Queen's Gambit, Container, Kingdom Death Monster. (Obviously I'm jumping between years).  I can go and buy any of them currently but I despise price gouging pricks.
Carcassonne and all its expansions in their original artwork.
The obvious choice for me would be to buy a bunch of Alpha/Beta Black Lotuses when they just came out.  If you were good, just buy a box of cards and trade for all of the things that would become out of print rares.
all the Advanced Squad leader I can get and multiple copies so I can fleabay them and still make a profit here. 
For personal wants?  HeroQuest and all of its expansions.

For profit?  Black Lotus, before M:tG's huge comeback
magic the gathering black lotuses 
Formula De maps, so many formula De maps
A bunch of those [Gamescience Zocchihedron D100 balls](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OoydCWisTao/VmnE_FFO1BI/AAAAAAAADuQ/XuU_EKGtEv8/s1600/2.jpg). I used to have one but I lost it when I lost my box of mid 90's MtG cards. Now those stupid useless dice go for $75 each.
I'd go back and not buy $1000 I already spent and use it for something else
I think the idea of this post isn't to go back and get something to bring to present day to sell and make more money. But to go back and get something when it was retail price at the time because you can't find it any more because it's out of print and people are asking insane amounts.

In that instance, even though it was only sold through mail order, would be to go back to 1968 and get Roger Cormier's Trafalgar. Only a little more than 400 were produced, and when they pop up for sale these days they go for over $1,000. Back then I think it was like $30 or $40 in mail order.

Other than that, I can't currently think of anything I would get. Maybe Heroquest or World of Warcraft the board game.
Original Monopoly. Not the version we know now, the version by Elizabeth Magie that WB stole off her. Her version was to win by being the most philanthropic. I'd also use the time machine to make sure she got the riches she deserved. 
Taking $1,000 USD back in time to buy hobby/gaming goods that will be worth significantly more in current times?

If I were getting stuff just for me to keep, I would get some of the really early Games Workshop 40K minis, and a full set of Necromunda stuff. That's ungodly expensive, but I loved me some Necromunda!

Profit-wise? I would go get a bunch of old Magic cards, like Black Lotus, et cetera, and even the Dual Lands (Tundra, Taiga, et cetera) which sold for surprising amounts of money a few years back. I think that would be the biggest bang for my buck.

Then again, a bunch of copies of Dark Tower would be really cool to bring back with me.

Finally, if we're going all-out bonkers here, I'd go back in to antiquity and have some archeological game boards (Senet, anyone? Go? Ur?) hand made by artisans at that time, and then just rake in the dough.
A lot of the older MtG cards, like Arabian Nights era. I loved the artwork on them.

Besides that, Warhammer 40k: Battle for Macragge, an SNES, and things like Chrono Trigger, Mario RPG, etc.
Valuable comics which are now collectable. Sell the same in the present, buy all the current stuff I want. 
I would go back in time to the very first game/hobby store and then bring the $1000USD back to the present day, adjusted for inflation, and spend it on modern games that will make me forget about anything I can't currently have. And buy a larger house with a dedicated game room.
I mean, with this kind of power, why not use the $1000 to buy stocks of Facebook, Google, Apple, or some other hugely successful technology corporation? Your $1000 would be worth like $100,000 now...

Even better is to grab last week's winning lottery numbers and go back in time just one week and buying those exact numbers. You'll turn $2 into $10,000,000 with basically no effort whatsoever.
**Freedom:The Underground Railroad**? 
**The Captain Is Dead**  is the most challenging co-op I've played. Games come down to the wire almost every time.

The surviving crew of the ship needs to work together to get remaining vital support systems online (and keep them online), all the while aliens that must be dealt with are boarding the ship. 
Critical ship systems WILL go down!

The crew needs get the Jump Core back online so they can warp out of here. The crew loses the game if the ship takes too much damage or if they're overwhelmed by aliens. 
**Burgle Bros**?
It's not really heavy, but **Beyond Baker Street** is fantastic. It's a little like Hanabi, but feels like there's more meat on the bones (or at least some theme). I'd put it on par with the Oniverse games (**Nautilion** is releasing in early December, by the way).

My wife and I also like **Legends of Andor**, though we're not too far in yet. Don't get the FFG version, as it has tons of errors on the cards and manual and tiles.

**Shadowrun Crossfire** is a fairly simple and quick co-op deckbuilder with persistent, upgradable characters. We like it, but it's difficult, and I think that's where the weight would come in.

**Black Orchestra**? I have not played it yet, but I've got a copy on order because who doesn't want to plot to assassinate Hitler??

There's also **Albion's Legacy (second edition)**, that might be good for them. I have not yet played it, but I've watched playthroughs and I'm looking forward to it. Don't get the first edition, though. The box is gigantic and the components subpar quality.
**Dead Men Tell No Tales** is basically like Flash Point mixed with Forbidden Island: pirates, skeletons, and treasure. Pretty great Coop.

**Legendary: Marvel** is an absolute blast. The base set alone is a little easy, but there's tons of expansions for it.
Just curious how come the app is a turn off for mansions of madness 2nd edition? 
Might be worth taking a look at the upcoming **Mistfall: Heart of the Mists** release.  The first one was an excellent solo/co-op game with a pretty fairly heavy (and overly complex) ruleset.  The one coming out now has a more streamlined set of instructions - and if they end up liking it they can pick up the original **Mistfall** for more variety!
Bomb Squad

Fortune and Glory

Space Cadets: Away Missions

Galaxy Defenders

Heroes Wanted is competitive, but the Champions and Masterminds expansions provide a cooperative mode
Alright, so it might sound a little strange since the base game isn't co-op, but you've already listed so many co-op games so maybe it's worth a look.

Orleans plus the Invasion expansion (which as part of it turns it into a pretty good co-op experience).

The biggest problem would be the cost associated with having to get both the base and expansion all at once. But I figured I'd mention it anyways since it might not come up on any co-op game lists.
Maybe something from VPG -- **Darkest Night** and **Dawn of the Zeds** are both good.
My wife and I play a lot of Co ops, you've mentioned most of them but can also recommend Big Book Of Madness, Warhammer Quest ACG, Space Hulk Death Angel, Yggdrasil. We have Sentinels of the Multiverse which is fine but we don't love it. We've bought but not yet played Mythos Tales, Star Trek Frontiers and The Ravens of Thri Sahashri (Christmas!). 

Good luck in your search :)
**Legends of Andor**

**Commissioned**

**Galaxy Trucker**
Now this is the strangest game of Catan I've ever heard described.
In general it's considered good form to actually tell us the name of your game in question not just .... imply the name after an ellipsis. 


Is this about one night werewolf?
Why would the hunter shoot the tanner?
Maybe r/boardgamescirclejerk can help
So the rules of the game were revised when [Forgotten King](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156548/super-dungeon-explore-forgotten-king) (the second base game) came out. Anything with V2 has the revised rules on the cards. Anything from before that has the rules written with respect to Super Dungeon Explore 1st Edition. Basically, if you think you will only get the base game and not Forgotten King, you could get the V1 versions of things to go with it. Otherwise, buy V2 to get the most up to date rules. If you have to buy V1, all the cards to upgrade to V2 can be bought together in the [Forgotten King Upgrade Deck](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/175474/super-dungeon-explore-forgotten-king-upgrade-deck) (which includes cards to upgrade the base game, too).

The general advice is to first buy a base game (SDE or Forgotten King). The original SDE requires assembly for miniatures, but none of the later content does. Personally, I would get Forgotten King now, because SDE is getting a reprint next year that will include the newest version of the rules and assembled miniatures.

If you like it, buy the other base game, as it will give you the most content for the price. Caverns of Roxor and Von Drakk offer new sets of monsters/heroes/bosses, and would be the logical next step to get after the two base games. The rest of the packs are just more figures, which allow the heroes and overlord more choice when picking characters. No need to get them until you are very experienced with the base games.

SDE Legends is in development along side the reprint version of the base game. Legends adds a campaign where you can evolve your characters over many games played in sequence, like an RPG. It won't be out until the middle of next year, so don't worry about it now. That is also when the third version of the base rules will come out, to help streamline the game more. I'm petty sure Soda Pop Miniatures is going to release these rules as pdfs online, so you'll be able to download them if you want to try. They're being playtested by the hardcore fans right now.
Hello!
Super Dungeon Explore has two editions, the latest being Super dungeon Explore: The Forgotten King which has cleaned up the game compared to the first edition making it easier to play and less confusing.
As SDE Forgotten King is the second edition, and the recommend version to pickup you want to get expansions that are for V2 so they are compatible (there is a upgrade pack you can buy to use V1 stuff).

I would recommend getting the game first, play it a few times and once you happy then look into buying more.

SDE is also a fun game to paint even if you have never done it before, prime, bold simple colours, Black wash, dry brush a lighter colour on top to give depth and then gloss!!

Check out SDE at board game geek as the forum has many helpful owners.

I'm sure somebody will reply with a better more in depth answer shortly.
Oh and Legends is an expansion that aims to give SDE a campaign structure.

**Coup** is the perfect game for this. Cheap and incredibly simple to teach too.

I also love the bluffing aspects of **Condottiere** (also known as *Gwent* if you're a Witcher 3 fan). The game is tricky to find but can be had in [Chinese for relatively cheap](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Condottiere-Card-Game-Board-Games-Family-Friends-Party-Games-/162279651378?hash=item25c89ef832:g:j5MAAOSwal5YGjhT) - the game itself is language independent so you'd just need to download the rules in English.
**Resistance:Avalon** would be your best bet if you have 5+ players.
**The Resistance** and **Coup** always come to mind. **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** might also fit the bill, although it's less about reading a person directly.
All these and these short light party games**Skull, Good Cop Bad Cop, Dead Last, Liar's Dice, Spyfall,** and **Mafia da Cuba**. 

And depending how you play it and if you're looking for something meatier **A Game of Thrones: The Board Game**

**Dead of Winter** or **Cosmic Encounter** if you want something mid-weight!
Deception: Murder in Hong Kong

Resistance: Avalon

One Night Ultimate Werewolf

Coup + Reformation

Cash N Guns 2nd edition

If you want to stink your teeth into mechanics

Cosmic Encounter
I third Coup. Fun party game.
**One Night Ultimate Werewolf**

**Secret Hitler**
**Coup** comes to mind. Also, Poker. **Citadels** has some people-reading in it. As does **Libertalia**.
**Diplomacy** offers a mix of both, but definitely leans more on the side of reading the other players.
The Broken Token sells a very nice padded bag on their website. Like everything they sell it is of very high quality and has lasted its way to many many cons and back.
I ordered one. Should be here next week!

You can buy 25 Ikea bags or like 10 grocery bags for the same price. These are probably fine, but completely unnecessary 
It's perfectly fine with two players and I think even a little bit easier. I made the experience that difficulty increases with player number. But there are always ways to adjust the difficulty, so no problems there!

I just loaded the first scenario and it will be around 200 cards. You can sleeve them in one setting because you will usually have a lot of card sorting to do anyway. 

The game is just great. You can play and replay scenarios using different Avatars, you can adjust the difficulty, you can use a traitor module to spice things up. A lot to replay there. 
> Firstly, How well does it play with just 2 players?

It plays fine at two, but doing so really drops the difficulty. In contrast playing with a full five is hard mode (though I have gotten through the 1st & 2nd movie at 5, so it is not unbeatable). 

Overall I really enjoy the game and am currently looking forward to finally getting the expansion for it that releases at the beginning of December.

As for sleeves, I do not know how many you will need for just the first game offhand. Do expect at least an hour of just sorting cards before playing, never mind the time it takes to sleeve what you need to.

I personally have color coded my decks to make sorting easier. There are only a few cards that go between decks (mainly the scenario and player ones) and for those I made a copies of and put in the corresponding colored sleeves. I also keep spare sleeves in the box for anything I missed. 

But if you don't want to keep it simple, there are only two different card backs in the game, so you can either go with one color or two colors and be alright.

I have played this solo, 2 player, 3 player and 5. The rulebook has a guide for the number of cards you need to scale the difficulty accordingly. The less people you have, the less downtime each player has, so it does become easier.

I love the game, as both an Alien fan and gamer.
Just a heads up, the cards come in seemingly random order. There is tiny print on the bottom of each card saying what deck it belongs in. Took me well over an hour just to unbox and sort the cards out, longer if you're sleeving.
Game is amazing, if you like Alien it's even better. 

Do yourself a favour and download/print this one page card sorting list: https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/107161/1-page-card-list

You will know everything is in the right deck, and be sure you aren't missing anything. 
Most of the cards need the same color sleeve because they are mixed together. I'm using Black because it fits the theme. For the objective cards I selected blue, locations brown, hatchery orange and red.   Also I printed some dividers that you can find in the game forum on boardgamegeek with nice pictures.
I can help with the first and third questions:

I think the game plays *pretty* well with 2 players, but if you have experience with other deckbuilders, I think that two players can start to become a bit easy after a game or two of potentially getting wrecked while learning some of the unique mechanics.

I found 3-4 "players" to be the sweet spot, and at 4 the game starts to become a good bit more difficult and tense.  For two players, it might be worth considering having each play two characters, or stick to one avatar each and try some of the other included difficulty-increasing rules included in the instructions (taking drones out will help crank things up)

As for thoughts, [I reviewed Legendary Encounters Alien Deck Builder for BoardGameBuds](http://boardgamebuds.com/legendary-encounters-alien-deckbuilding-game-review/) and ended up really liking it - and this is from someone who got sick of Marvel Legendary very quickly.  I think a lot of the mechanics just *nail* the theme of the movies, and even the included player alien variant is great and adds to the high level of difficulty.

I don't want my first point to make the game sound easy, because the first couple of times we played it we got beat pretty badly.  Chestbursters are nasty.
Boards and cinder blocks.
Do you live in Montreal? Because that's how they roll. 
I went with the Ikea Ivar line.  Its a bit more expensive, but I like having wooden shelves.  They also setup/takedown pretty quickly and are compact.
Everyone is a first time creator at some point, what impresses me is the 80+ projects you, yourself have backed!  Good luck to you, it looks interesting!
This looks like it'd be pretty fun, but it just feels looks like there just isn't enough in the game (for me at least). Part of its probably I'm not a fan of memory in games.

That said, I really like the theme and art, and wouldn't object if someone were to bring this game tot the table.

Hope you get funded!
Welcome to the Kickstarter designers club dude :). I joined a design team as we got our first game funded earlier this year and it's a lot of work but a lot of fun so far. (Darklight: Memento Mori if you want to check it out.)

Looks like you've got a quick and fun game there. Good luck with everything and I hope the funding goes well!

Looks interesting. You'll probably be downvoted fairly hard though. A lot of people are weird about self promotion, so it would probably be smart to be a little more subtle about it. This is doubly true for a game like yours which is obviously going for a wide appeal. People tend to be more accepting if someone is pushing something that is a bit riskier.
Is this inspired by **Sheriff of Nottingham**?

That's a reimagining of **Contraband**, which has the same theme as your game
The aesthetic is really great and the different kinds of cards have a visual distinction a lot of games fail to pull off. Kudos to your art guy. 
Best of luck to you sir!
Read the rules and feel they are a bit unclear.  So here are two questions.  

+ How are baggage cards supposed  
to be placed in front of you? In a pile  
(like a deck) or a row?  
* The setup order seems off.  This is  
how I read it:  
 1. You separate the baggage from  
the passengers.  
 2. Deal baggage cards.  
 3. Shuffle baggage and passenger   
cards together.  
 4. Deal passenger cards.  
  **However,** they are now mixed.  Is it ok to  
receive baggage cards at this time? 
good luck, this looks fairly polished for a first design!
Sounds like a mix of Inis and Mission Red Planet
Looks fun! Good luck with getting backed :) I might pledge if my gaming group is keen
Looks like you've reached your goal, grats! I really like the theme and overall simplicity of the game - almost everyone knows what the silly airport requirements are so you can introduce people really easily. Good luck with the finishing touch!
great job so far! hope the best for ya!

Love the game concept!  Congratulations on making your Kickstarter goal, too.  I can't resist being able to add something to a game, so I pledged the "Add an item" even though you're already beyond the goal.   :D
Congrats for funding your game!


I have a rule question, hopefully you don't mind answering here: does any other passenger cards affecting concealed cards still affects baggage protected by the Ambassador card?

So, if I use my Ambassador on baggage A, can another player swap/steal it?
Looks like a fun, simple game! Will definitely be backing soon!
Congrats on getting funded :D I also backed! I was asked this question so many times. Brings back memories of explosive alarms going off from ipads and security and what not  :P 

Plus 6 players is a big + :D
Looks cool and love the design. Congrats on hitting your goal :)
Best of luck to you! Don't worry about any naysayers here, the last game I remember the snobs in this forum turning their nose up to was Unfair, and that ended up being a nice little success story.
Reminds me of "Smuggle" a game I had as a kid...
Congrats man!  I wish you tons of success, sir!

You're probably not going to get a good response here because there just isn't much "game" in your idea. It's more of a party activity than a board or card game. This subreddit is probably not your target market, your market would be people who typically *don't* play hobby games.  
  
* There is no game. I read your write-up and there are no rules, it's just read the cards. Games without direction aren't very well received. Why couldn't people just look up questions on the internet and read them to each other? Why wouldn't they play the 80 other party games that do the same thing like **Would You Rather**, **Loaded Questions**, or **Game of Things** that actually have rules and structure?  
  
* The yellow text on the Jokers is next to impossible to read. I don't know if that's a final draft, but I certainly would be put off by those cards.  
  
* I just don't understand who would pay $30 for this when someone can go to Target and get **Would You Rather** *and* **Loaded Questions** for the same price? Plus a deck of cards for an extra $2.

**edit**: I misread the price, it's only $15, but the point remains, why this over something like Would You Rather?
You're lucky that this is the most polite subreddit on the entire site...
You should drop the "Play. Ask. Mate" tagline in my opinion. To a native English speaker "mate" in that context as a verb will be intuitively be interpreted as meaning sex. I guess maybe you meant that as a bit of fun, but yeah it reads odd.

A mate is a friend, to mate is to reproduce. "Mate Cards" is ok but it's still a bit awkward sounding.

Good luck!
No snark - this seems like something that would come in a human resources  "So you just took over a company and fired half the workers..." Survival kit. 


If this is meant to foster friendship on a deeper level between people who already interact socially... You would do better simply picking up an already produced filler game that is easy to pick up and having people interact organically. 

Ice breakers and HR "get to know you" games only make typical people uncomfortable or annoyed, which can lead to an *us vs management* team building goal but certainly not build deeper friendships between people who already interact socially.
Seems okay, but I can't really say I would play anything with a regular deck of cards and reading off questions would be a bit awkward compared to the social games I have. 
If you're willing to accept some critiques- some of which have already been touched on,  but in further detail.    

The name mate has sexual connotations. Might I suggest the simple name Meet instead? Seems to hit the goal of your game as well without stirring people up.   

As far as a game, you don't actually have one. It's just a deck of cards at this point. There's no reason why you couldn't add something simple game wise. For example, play like war, loser of the round has to answer the question. Doesn't have to be complex, but it helps to give it more purpose.    

Your categoriesin general seem like they could use a little refinement. The difference between embarrassing story and trainspotting/extreme ironing/carving eggshells is massive. One is open ended enough to mean anything. The other is so niche that it doesn't seem like it should be of the same suit. (Btw, trainspotting just makes me think of heroin and dead babies climbing on the ceiling.)    

Kind of in the similar vein, half of your deck seems to be composed in a sentence structure, and the other half is a statement. One just says embarrassing story. The other is when I was small I believed. Personally I would unify the deck, would be as simple as saying,  share an embarrassing story, or something to the affect.    

I'm not usually one to get involved into the political spectrum, but you may also want to reword such cards as my bros call me... but my mommy calls me... (re:mommy) these days families come in all different types and (re:bros) it feels more like you're speaking of a brother rather than friends because you chose slang (which seems even more odd since besides the name of the game, the other examples don't include any)   

I'm not sure what the final product would look like, but I can't read the yellow font very well. Could be just me/or my screen. Would ask you to switch it to pretty much any other color personally. To minimize the pain to your (lovely) design so far, I might suggest purple since it already occurs in your product. Another option would be to provide a black outline around your font. (This would help with all the cards, especially if using in a low light area)    

You do have lovely design however, and I at the very least like the idea of your product. All of my comments are given with the best of intentions. Good luck! 
This game sounds like what an HR VP would come up with for a team building exercise at a soulless cubicle farm company.
The problem I am seeing here.. is it just seems like a themed deck of playing cards. There is no mechanical reason for asking the questions. Why not just use a regular deck of playing cards and print out a list of icebreaker questions?
I don't know if you've ever heard of a boardgame called the Ungame. It was made by some doctor of psychology and it had 2 decks of cards. one was deep understanding and the other light hearted. Both decks are just a question to ask the other players. Anyhow I once brought the cards on a date and asked each other the questions and had a great conversation going the whole date. I probably came across pretty geeky but we had a good date and I got some too.  I think you have a great idea for a game.
Good luck. I apologize on behalf of the subreddit (can I do that, /u/Epsilon_balls?) if anyone isn't kind to you about your idea.


**Timeline: Music and Cinema**

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/145189/timeline-music-cinema

It's a simple, casual game where players arrange cards, in this case music and movies,  in order by the year it was published.


Sounds like they'd enjoy Codenames
Maybe look at [The Game of Tones](http://www.juegodetonos.com/en/the-game/). 

There was another Korean game where you play notes, but I can't remember the name. I think it was at the board game geek store at one point. I'll try to look it up when I get home. 
There is a good little trick taking game called **Take the A Chord** which can be bought right from Japan here:

http://saashiand.buyshop.jp/items/2411378

I think it would make a great unique gift for the music fan, also very simple. Double points if she likes jazz for the pun in the title alone.
Grats to your mom on her DMA what was her dissertation on?  I studied music back in the day in college.  Was a great time.

Hmm wine + chatting + gaming... I was going to recommend **Opera** but that's kind of a medium game and def doesn't meet your criteria. Funny enough there's better wine games in board gaming than there are music-related board games.  I guess that's a convo for another time.  Sorry I don't have much to add but great topic and enjoyed your post

I say, play a bunch of rounds of the regular base game deck (15 cards) until everyone 'gets it' - shouldn't take long. Then break out the expansion.

As far as how many cards to use, stick with 15, just replace the Ambassadors with the Inquisitors and give everyone a team card. The additional 'regular' cards in Reformation are for playing 7-10 people.
The extra cards are ONLY used if you play with more than 6 players.

However, the game was not designed for this, and even states this in the rulebook!  It was just something they put in as a common request, plus it's good to have additional cards if the old Coup cards get marked.

As someone who has played a lot of Reformation, you can play it easily play it even for beginners (the game isn't that hard to understand) and I would skip the Inquisitor since she is way too strong.  I find the Reformation expansion turns into a game of tactics and bluffing, instead of straight bluffing, and can easily work with at least four people.  Odd name of players isn't an issue since it's still a free for all.
It ultimately depends on your preferences. However, I recommend sticking with the original 15 card deck for 4-5 players.


I don't think making bluffing easier (and deduction harder) will make the game more fun. It will simply lengthen the game, and team play (from Reformation) already does that in a more interesting way.
I always advise against the "no. of players + 1" base count. I always play bases equal to player count or one less. Gets everything moving faster.
Haven't played much, and haven't played with all the expansions, but I'd probably avoid wizards (and any other factions that can combo endlessly). It's difficult to mentally store the number of actions/creatures you have to play with after a very combo-y round. Its also boring to play with, at least that's what my friends have told me. 
I have Smash Up, but I'm not a Smash Up expert. That said, I feel like Ghosts are kind of tough to combo with. At least the few times I've played with them, they did not mesh well with the faction they were paired with.
I absolutely love this game and play a decent amount, and have shown quite a few different people to play. I would say that a couple really good introductory factions would be Dinosaurs and Princesses. Both of these factions are fairly straight forward and don't require a whole lot of complex play. I would also recommend staying away from Cthulhu factions for the first play through, while I personally don't think that madness cards are very confusing to figure out I have had several new players feel overwhelmed when I tell them there are extra rules. Aliens and Ninjas are a little more complex than Dinosaurs and Princesses, but they aren't too hard to figure out (also can make for a great combo to spam VPs) 

I hope that helped and I wish you the best of luck on the play through, hopefully your kids like it, it is a fantastic game!
Have you asked them? 
I just signed up for it, and unfortunately I also just agreed to not talk about it.
That sounds like a recipe for disaster, but I would love it if they made it work satisfyingly.
Other ideas:
- Fury of Dracula
- Fortress America
Tragedy Looper is a possibility that hasn't been mentioned yet. It's a 1v3 deduction/hidden movement game where one player plays as a mastermind trying to stop the three protagonists from passing through a time loop.
**CONAN** seems right up your alley. One vs all. Scenario based. 

u/r2d8 getinfo

Ignore r2d8, that's the wrong game. 
Have a look at **Days of Ire: Budapest 1956**
I'll second **Tragedy Looper** although I've only played it 1v1 so far. I think it will only get better when I can go up to 1v3.

I'll also recommend AGAINST **Letters from Whitechapel** at high player counts. It's said to be best at 2p, and I'll never play again with more than that (well, MAYBE I could be convinced to try at 3p).
The best 1vAll game I know and dig is **Friedrich** which is a large departure from the titles you've listed here, but I'll justify:

It is in essence a 4 player game, each player has their own victory conditions as well as 3 of the players are trying to stop the 4th (Friedrich) - as well as the 3 cannot attack each other but can attack Friedrich.

Combat is really neat with a squared board showing poker suits (Scott Nicholson's video- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_mFOyMIdPM does a much better job of going over most aspects of the game), and the depth & possibility for repeated metaplay is fantastic.  

It is also a historic near-wargame but I liken it more to poker (lots and lots of bluff in this one) meets area control meets heavy board game (accessible though! the rulebook is relatively small) meets team/1vsA.  

It is pretty rockin' man.  Oftentimes the theme doesn't get people very stiff but once they play, I've had solid experiences.

GL!
You seem to be under the impression that you can't play Descent missions as one-shot adventures and that's just not true. The same is true for Imperial Assault. 

Each campaign is comprised of scenarios. Pick an xp level, choose skills up to that level, play.

I have no issue with Level 7: Omega Protocol's minis, and the game is just excellent. I can recommend it for sure. 

Perhaps Super Dungeon Explore? Until the latest kickstarter is shipped, there's no story at all. It's just a hack n slash session.
**Ghost Stories: Black Secret** would be a different approach. True, it's an expansion and is probably even better with the White Moon expansion. True, it may not exactly be campaign based.  But this game, played solo, as a group, or as 1 v all in Black Secret *always* keeps you on your toes and rewards repeated plays. I'm making a point to play GS 20 times in 2017. Worth a look, anyway.
I have only the core set I picked up a few weeks ago. Currently played 20 times and still got a lot of mileage in the core set - the included scenarios and cards, plus the excellent custom scenarios by ninjadorg are more than enough. I think it gives you a good idea of what strengths and weaknesses of each sphere, and really whether you actually like the game or not. 

I have picked up most of the mirkwood cycle from eBay but not opened or mixed anything in yet as I know once I do I won't go back. It was more just so I know I have it :)

I can highly recommend this guide if you want to get everything you can from the core set: https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/16397/guide-new-lotrlcg-solo-players

Also ignore the doom mongers that the game is dead. You can find posts from the last several years saying that. A new deluxe expansion is out soon, plus they are yet to finish the saga expansions, and the previous cycles are appearing on the reprint list. As one of their best selling LCGs it would appear to have legs yet :)
I'm considering getting into both. 

There are too many LOTR expansions for me to ever own them all & the games look to have very different feels. 

LOTR to me is more of a co-op MTG style game, whereas Arkham looks like more of an rpg/narrative style game. Haven't had a chance to actually play Arkham yet but I think i'll be hanging onto the LOTR stuff when I get around to it. 
For me it was great! The theming and how it works into the rules is brilliant. 

Just having the core set might be a bit sparse, although I had a lot of plays out of it, but you also don't need all the expansions to have some fun out of it. 

I've really enjoyed the 'saga' expansion which follow the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books, and add cool campaign rules (persistent upgrades and dangers across plays). 

For more info see here, and look for the 'saga' expansions: https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/
How much do you enjoy the theme vs arkham theme? 
Yeah, it is very worth it. Lots of expansions available so you can pick and choose where you want to quest next after the core set. :)
Very worth it. The first cycle isn't the best, they became a lot more adventurous with their design in later cycles, but it does have a lot of decent player cards that will help in deck building. Then just get the Hobbit / Fellowship saga boxes if that's what you're in to.
I know a local guy selling like $700 worth of stuff for $300. It's everything through 2015. Just an idea of what you might find on the used market. (if you are interested in that lot, though, I could connect you to him). My view on it is that, since it's an adventure card game, buying in now just means you'll never run out of things to play. 
I've not played or even looked at Arkham Horror, so I can't comment on that game or any possible similarities to the LOTR LCG.

I can say that I started playing the LOTR LCG in 2014 and find it to be a great game. The gameplay itself has a very strong questing/accomplishing feel and it fits the theme very well, in that the game isn't all about fighting and killing. I would agree with everyone here in that the game is always being rumored to be ending or whatnot. It seems every time FFG puts out a new product people think that marks the end of LOTR. That's just not proven to be true.

Right now, there are a ridiculous amount of expansions to get and some can be had at really cheap prices on clearance. I've found that there's always something of use in each expansion, so even the clearanced ones can get you some good material. 
I own just about every **LotR:LCG** expansion, including the Nightmare and POD stuff, and I am firmly in the camp of **LotR:LCG** being FFG's best LCG product. The model fits perfectly for it, and there are a TON of deck building options just in the Core box. There is a good variety to the quests. However, if really feel the need to have everything it's going to cost you a bit. Thankfully, FFG has done reprints of the earlier cycles in the last 6 months, so now is a good time to buy in if you want to do everything in order. If you are getting another core set and the first cycle on the cheap, pull the trigger now. You can always resell.

From a gameplay perspective, **LotR:LCG** and **Arkham:LCG** share a few things mechanically, part of having a designer cross over, but **Arkham** is much more like playing **Arkham/Eldritch Horror** in a distilled card format. It is very very good, but not nearly as wide open as **LotR** primarily because of the deck building restrictions on characters.

**LotR** also plays differently. You put many more cards on the board compared to **Arkham** where you might end up using cards for one-off skill check tests. Additionally, you do a lot more mathematical calculation in **LotR** compared to **Arkham**. Finally, in **LotR** you are limited only by the cards you can play, where in **Arkham** you are limited more by the "3 actions per turn" rule. Obviously there are cards that work around this, but in general on a turn you will only be able to do 3 things.

In summary, **LotR:LCG** is comparable to more of a pre-constructed competitive card game like **Netrunner**, **Magic**, **GoT** etc. where **Arkham:LCG** is much more of an RPG like experience done in a card-format. Both are very good games and if you can get both I would recommend it.

I really like it, but thats because it scratches a deck building itch while being cooperative. The setting and how the mechanics tie into the theme helps, too. If you are interested, I just put a review up on my site, The Cardboard Herald, here's the link:
http://www.cardboardherald.com/reviews/2016/11/8/review-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game
Not a huge fan of the theme, but loving it so far (playing it at the same time as Arkham horror lcg, no regrets). Currently plowing throuvh the second cycle. Has a great mix of strategic planning and tactics. If you're looking for a great solo game to invest yourself in then I can't think of anything better.

One note: instead of buying a second or third core, have you considered making proxies of all the card  plies you want? I scanned all the cards and printed copies on 100lb paper at staples and the results are pretty good. Cost $5 to print all the cards I wanted, which is much more palatable than $80 for two extra cores.
For me gameplay was good, although when I beat quest, I didn't feel need to replay that, and go beat it again. Deck building was boring part. Took more time than actual gaming did, so me and my gf basically made some decks we found online and played almost all missions with them.
All in all, it was good purchase, since I sold it for 3x the price, because I got it for something like 20% of the original price.
Look for 2nd hand sets, you can get them for something like 50% discount usually, not worth full retail tbh.
I played this game in order of quests released, up to and including the first quest of the first deluxe expansion. I loved it the first week I played it, but now not so much. I find myself mentally exhausted after a game, because the nature of the game requires you keep all the variables in your head at all times in order to succeed.  Every round you're counting up all your stats and trying to figure out how many characters you should commit to quest while still having people to block and attack, taking into account all the special abilities, plus you're accounting for chance.  I think at this point in time I play games to relax as opposed to play games to be mentally stimulated to the max.  So if thats what you're looking for, is a great game.

Piggybacking on this thread: anyone have experience with playing nothing but the Core Set (or two) and the Saga Expansions?

I'm really interested in this game but don't want to dive into the deep end with a million Adventure Packs. I may get there someday, since I've said roughly the same thing about several other FFG LCGs, but for now I'd like to keep it small and stick to the deluxe boxes around the Lord of the Rings saga.

Will I still have a good time playing? Will missing those key meta cards from the APs make it really difficult to complete Saga Expansion missions?
I found the rules a little overly complicated for what the game was. The base set also seemed to be very lacking in content and while you don't have to keep up with a meta, the pressure on buying more just to make a deck that lets you feel capable at the game put me off. Traded it away.
I didn't like LOTR LCG at all. 

I bought the base set, khazad dum, and the first two adventure packs.

I found the game incredibly boring.
Great theme. Great art. Boring game play.

I traded my set in for store credit. Couldn't get rid of it fast enough.
I would say no, only to tell you to buy into Star Wars Destiny instead!
Your best bet for low volume printing is probably a laser cutter.  You might try [Blue Panther LLC](http://www.bluepantherllc.com/), they are providing Print on Demand services for Victory Point Games and Hollandspiele.
I've been watching and hoping that you'd hit the target!  I can't pledge now, but I hope that I'll be able to get a copy later. Looks like it'll be fun when my 3yo is a little older. 
So excited and humbled by the support I have gotten! I am here to answer any questions.
Man, the 3-D board and neon pieces are super 90s.
For those not following the link: 

>But the biggest twist you’ll find in this version of the game is that no one actually dies. Instead of solving a murder by figuring out who the killer was, what weapon they used, and where they committed the crime, Clue: Star Wars Edition ($25) has players trying to escape the moon-sized space station with a copy of the Death Star’s plans.

So it's kind of a new game, much like the surprisingly decent **Risk: Star Wars Edition** from 2015
Seems interesting, but why isn't this a Rogue One themed game? Isn't the plot of that movie about stealing the plans to the Death Star? It seems it would make sense from a promotional standpoint, and you can't tell me it wouldn't sell like crazy.
It was Tarkin, in the trash compactor, with the hydrospanner.  
  
Just doesn't haven't the same ring to it...
Does this not yet have a BGG page. How can I add it to my BGG wishlist.
For some reason Darth Vader is helping Han, Leia, 3P0, R2, Chewie & Luke escape with the plans for the Death Star.

Which is clearly revisionist history. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Why are they being removed from history? #bothanlivesmatter
I like star wars but it's getting a bit thin now. Do we really need more star wars themed games?
I saw this and had high hopes that it *wasn't* Clue, like how Star Wars Risk was basically a mass market version of Queen's Gambit. It sounds like this is exactly like Clue, only with a Star Wars theme and a 3d board.
I miss-read as Cludeo and I wondered who would kill Han Solo in the hall with a lightsaber....
Meh
It was always a little odd to me that a game played by kids under 10 has a homicide theme.
How can Darth Vader be working against the Empire....WTF???

Couldn't they get another character from the world, like Lando?
Alderaan, R2D2, the Millennium Falcon. Done.
Twenty bucks at Toys R Us. 
Anyone know if they're going to do a "Black" version like they did for Risk?
I suppose the idea is novel but this comes off as an even more blatant cash grab.  Won't go near it
So yet again they are using a popular board game name to promote a game that has nothing to do with the original.  I would think that the Star Wars name alone would be enough, do you really need to subvert the Risk and Clue name brand?
Take my money!
It was Jar Jar in the Garbage Compactor with a Bowcaster!
I'm pretty sure I already saw this a few weeks ago in a Toys R Us by downtown L.A.  Unless they are a test market or something?
That doesn't look anything like a death star. The actual death star was a sphere and much, much bigger.
at what point are the cross over games no longer even considered the original game.

like how many things can be changed before its not even clue anymore.

also the star wars brand has been so dilluted i dont even care about it anymore.
YOu sure it's not better to buy from your own country then? I live in Europe, and I never found deal that even though it might be crazy discounted, but add expensive shipping + VAT on top of that, and suddenly, it gets same or more expensive compared to same item in my local store.
Do Amazon run B2G1 promos during Black Friday?
My flgs has a black friday sale and I plan to support them. It's a typical 25% off sale for them.  Not as cheap as online purchases but I can't by a place to play and gather online for the money I would save on games.
It's made of wood... use wood glue lol
Gorila Wood Glue is what I chose, and it works well. I applied it with a small-tipped paintbrush.
Wood glue or white glue should work.
Have built a lot of these. Any clear drying wood glue is fine. Use a cotton bud to remove any excess
I use Elmer's [wood glue](http://elmers.com/product/detail/e7010), and a wet rag to dab off the excess.  
I use this a lot, it was recommended by the Go7 Gaming insert company. You can get it at Michaels and Hobby Lobby. 

[Sobo Craft Glue](https://www.amazon.com/Premium-Craft-Fabric-Glue-4-Ounce/dp/B000XZUAH0)


Yea plastic cement works by melting the plastic a tiny bit. No plastic(of the right kind) no sticky.
Wood, white or even CA glue in a pinch.
I use [Aleene's Tacky Glue](https://www.michaels.com/aleenes-original-tacky-glue/M10614859.html).  I screwed up once and had to remove a piece ... it took a surprising amount of force to pull it apart.  Definitely can recommend it.
Plastic model glue isn't actually glue! It's a chemical that melts the plastic so that the two plastic parts bond into one piece.

What you want is PVA (aka white glue or wood glue). It's non-toxic and becomes transparent when it has dried.
wood glue that dries clear... whatever is available at your local hardware store will be just fine.
**Biblios** is a game I quite like that contains push-your-luck, auctioning and some bluffing. It is also awesome with 2 (unlike most auctioning games).

About a game where you walk around on a board, how about **Pandemic**? It is a game where you and friends walk around a board trying to cure 4 diseases as fast as possible. Need some planning with your friends and can be puzzly.

If you like a more war-like  strategy setting, perhaps try **Quantum** (pretty light, easy to learn)? You also move across the board with your dice in that game. Though you already have Small World.

Are you also interested in other styles of games? Like say, **7 Wonders** (space: **Among the Stars**), **Lords of Waterdeep** (cavemen: **Stone Age**), or a city building game.
Beyond Baker Street

Viticulture

Eight-Minute Empire: Legends

Carcassonne (we have the South Seas spinoff)

The Game

Kingsburg

Roll for the Galaxy

Lotus

Potion Explosion

Clue is kinda great, by the way. There is a version that supports 2 players. I have it, but haven't tried that variant yet.
Somebody already said Pandemic :) I'd like to add Forbidden Island if you like coop games. Very easy to learn and always a good warmup game for us (less than 60 min). Or Big book of madness. Although the first time you play this it might take a bit long to get a handle of it. 

And one of the newer games Inis (not coop) is pretty good with 2 players and also for more. We picked this up at Spiel this year. Still not sorry about it hehe. 
I just watched a video on Jongetsgames channel about deep sea adventure, and it could perhaps fit for what you're looking for. 
MOST worker placement games seem to work well with 2 and more, at least for me and my girlfriend. **Lords of Waterdeep** is her favorite. We also have **Viticulture** which scales surprisingly well.

A game to look into is **Orleans**. It's in the same vein as Dominion except you're building a bag of workers that you draw from every turn instead of a deck. That's been a success from 2-4p.

**Concordia** also scales pretty well because there's 2 different sides of the board like Small World depending on number of players.
I have had my eye on Coup for quite a while, it looks great. I was just worried about limited use as it looks like it is better with more players. 

Viticulture looks fantastic because I LOVE the theme. I watched a few videos and it seems quite complex to learn though, which put me off slightly. 
Keyflower is my vote.
Thanks for the suggestions so far. I hadn't really considered Catan to be honest – it looks great. I'm interested in any styles. I like quick setups with an element of 'fun' and interaction eg. auctions, bluffing, stealing from opponents, working together, trading etc.

I am researching all the other suggestions!
Stone Age!!
**Viticulture** has player scaling built right on to the game board, and does an excellent job at it without dramatically increasing the play time or having significant player downtime.

It's reasonably easy to teach as well.
+1 for Pandemic. Also Lords of Waterdeep, which should feel/play a little different at the various player counts, too.
Anyone have any suggestions for games similar to Betrayal at House on the Hill for 2 or more players?

I really like the mystery theme and also the procedural tile generation!
Why has no one mentioned **Coup**?

It's almost entirely a bluffing game for 2+ players. It's incredibly quick to play, and it's not hard to pick up. It is more intimidating to bluff when playing one-on-one, but the game plays in pretty much the exact same way at five or six.

Plus, there's a much-expanded version in **Coup: G54 Rebellion** for the aficionados who just can't get enough.

1. The buildings with a hand symbol symbolise a stopping point along the trail at which you can refresh your horses, grab a room in which to shave and sleep and have a drink at the salon. The owners of these small towns get pretty offended at people passing through without partaking of the services offered. The hazards require you to pay for assistance in their navigation from the locals or for repairs to damage caused by these hazards.
2. By paying for a hazard tile you are paying the locals to remove the hazard: clearing the fallen rock, rediverting the rivers, &c.
3. People from Kansas are known to overpay for cows: they can't get enough of them. You lose VP because your reputation isn't spread as far afield.
4. You get money for selling cows to people en route.
It's a heavy euro game. If you're looking for perfect thematic integration, you're sniffing up the wrong tree
The best explanation I can think of for #2 is that you are paying someone to clear the hazard. 
definitely get Heroes&Monsters collections
Thats really up to you. The Heroes/Monsters packs add more variety AND heroes. The Chains expansion and Mist expansion only add new enemies and tiles. And if I remember correctly also about the Heroes/Monsters packs is that they are basically the first edition monsters/heroes just updated. So it's really up to you if you want to add more heroes and monsters or just more monsters and tiles. 
App-only player here as well. Recently picked up Chains and played as Dezra the Battlemage/Berserker and had an amazing time.

The hybrid classes allow you to revisit some -not so good- characters.
For app-only players, H&M packs are the easiest recommendation in the world. That said, the app still doesn't take full advantage of new monsters and seems to think Descent players are enamored with the flesh moulders, but I'm sure that will improve with time.

Aside from the monsters, the main advantages an app-only player would get from the big- and small-box expansions are the new hero classes and new items. If you're playing a lot of standalone Delves (as opposed to playing campaigns), I think you'll get really good mileage out of new classes.
If you don't use the Overlord I feel most of chains would go to waste. If you really, really want the hbrids, then go for it.
My library (in Urbana, IL) has a circulating game collection - if it helps for suggesting titles to your library's staff, I keep a GeekList updated at BGG that includes the contents, updated as I learn about new things.
How does the library make sure that all game pieces remain with the game between rentals? And what happens when a single piece (or more) is inevitably lost? I would LOVE to see my library do this.

Also: Does the library restrict patrons by making sure the games stay on premise?

Sorry, so many questions. 

I know my FLGS has a library but you have to play the games there and honestly, it's rather safe considering the respect most patrons of that store have for tabletop games.
Sacramento CA Library also does this: http://www.saclibrary.org/Services/Library-of-Things


Their selection is quite good but almost everything is checked out at any given time.  I guess being utilized is a good thing.
That sounds interesting like an interesting concept.  Unfortunately, due to the size of the user base, I don't think this is feasible in my area.
This is a great suggestion! Additionally, some board game clubs will lend titles out to their trusted members. I borrowed a copy of Pandemic this week to check it out and I'm hoping to borrow Carcassonne and Catan this weekend - I haven't played either of them in a very long time and I have some friends new to the hobby who'd like to try them out.
Not sure about other countries, but in the UK I've noticed a lot of charity shops have a bunch of different games selling for really cheap.
I guess the one risk you might have is missing pieces.
Does anyone know if the library in Brooklyn has games?
I recommend doctor faust. 

Miniature Painting Basics: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL10C32CB2CD611E84

The most important thing is that you don't get discouraged by mistakes. Paint can be removed. Learn from it and keep going forward. 

Also learn to use washes, also called glazes. They are known amongst all miniature painters i know as "liquid talent". Even a bad mini can look ok with 3 colors and a wash. 
https://www.youtube.com/user/Sorastro

Excellent channel. It's targeted for beginners, and most of the advice for the particular models he paints carries over to painting any mini.
You might get more traction here /r/minipainting
Get the reaper beginner kit off of Amazon. Great way to start.
Wash is life. Do a crappy paintjob. Put wash everywhere. Done. Check the army painter tutorial for that.
[THIN YOUR PAINTS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3p_VuPIS2c)
Hey. I actually started painting last week. It's a lot easier than you'd imagine of you only want to paint the minis well enough to get on the table. 

http://imgur.com/a/9Jf90

That's a small album of the minis I've painted this week. And I used some basic beginner techniques that you can see here:

https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=fpDJe3Zh1M4

It's fun so far. I'd recommend it
Been painting for a few years now, and I love it! 

A few good lessons (all are good search topics on YouTube): 

 - Thin your paints! Most important! 

 - Layer up! Especially on your lighter colors (yellows, oranges, whites). 

 - Look up these techniques: Base Coat/Wash/Drybrush/Highlighting/Blending. 

 - Read up on your complimentary colors and saturation. 

Other than that, get after it! Don't get discouraged by how the first few might turn out, just chalk it up as learning. Post your first results over to r/minipainting asking for CC and you'll get lots of good advice! 

Good luck and welcome to the hobby. 
Hi.  There is a lot of good advice you have already gotten, so I am just going to offer some general advice.  

I just started painting about a year ago, and when I started, I wasn't very good.  My advice to you is to just keep painting once you start.  It relaxes me and I really enjoy it now.  I watched a lot of youtube tutorials and learned as much as I could.  I also started with cheap paints from Wal-Mart and brushes, but I upgraded later once I was sure I liked painting.

Also, start with a game you don't care if you do mess up.  I started with the Dungeons & Dragons Castle Ravenloft game and moved onto Chaos in the Old World and Blood Rage once I was confident.  

I'm still not very good, but I love learning new techniques and trying to improve all of the time.  

Good luck. 
Sure. 

Waterdeep but I'm not the best. Pm me
...yes.
Is this a question?
I guess my question would be why play vampires then? Most of the game in ONUV is the marks. Vampires give a mark to another player making them a vampire too. If you take out the marks then they're just Werewolves. You may as well just play ONUW&Daybreak.
OnuV rocks man.  I def prefer it over OnuW.  Any partic reason you don't want to use marks?

Just getting knowledge of the game underway / making sure people enjoy it?  
One Night Ultimate Rhubarb
**SET** is a great game about pattern matching. Takes a while to get good at it though and might not be good for younger people or people not looking for really thinky games.

**Incan Gold** is an easy to understand press your luck game that most people will pick up no problem.

**Coup** and **Skull** work great if the players are fully aware of the rules as explained. Skull might take one game of play before people really understand what they are supposed to do.

**Ultimate Warriorz** is my choice if reading is poor and you want something similar to King of Tokyo. I actually prefer Ultimate Warriorz more than KoT strategy-wise.

**No Thanks** and **Six Nimmit** are really great and shouldn't cause any problems for the specifics you're looking for.

**Liar's Dice** is a classic and easy to put together. Plus it was featured in Pirates of the Carribean, so someone might recognize it.

**Hey, That's My Fish** for the silly fun, but fairly easy strategy if you want it.
**No Thanks**, contains 33 cards numbered 3-35 and 55 chips

Plays 2-7, has these rules

*Aim*

To have the least points at the end of the game. Chips are worth -1 and cards are worth +number on them

*Set Up*

* Give each player their chips (11 for 3-5 players, 9 for 6 and 7 for 7)

* Shuffle deck and discard 9 cards without showing them

*Play*

* Active player flips over the top card and decides whether to take it or not

* If they take it they place it face up in front of them (with any chips on it) and repeat the above

* If they decide not to take it they place a chip from their supply on the card and play passes to the next player who decides whether to take or pass. A player without any chips will have to take the card.

* Repeat until all cards have been played

* Total up scores, with runs of numbers only counting their lowest score - ex. 31-32-33-34-35 would count as 31

* Lowest score wins, play can continue over multiple rounds until an agreed high score has been reached.
Get bit! sounds appropriate
The old classic Guillotine might work. Pretty simple "take that" mechanic but it's not really that mean. You're trying to collect sets of cards of different colors all worth points. The cards players use allow them to rearrange the cards and either take a card they want from the front or push a card to the rear. It's very interactive and goofy.

That's really the most simple way to explain it but the theme makes it light hearted and fun. You're rival executioners trying to capture the best heads of nobles during the French Revolution.
How many people? Love Letter and Coup are quick. Roll for It perhaps?
* No Thanks - Quick card game with numbers, easy rules, quick to play, interesting strategy. No text.

* 10 Days in... Europe, USA, Africa, Asia, or the Americas. Be the first to create a complete travel route, there are versions for different parts of the world. Great game that plays well with 2-4, and each round is short (~20 minutes), so you can play multiple times in a row. It's about drawing and replacing cards in a rack so that you have a fully connected trip between countries. A little bit like rummy and a lot like an old game called Rack-O. No text except the names of countries.

* Can't Stop - Fun, fast, dice-rolling press-your-luck game. No text.

* Cartegena - Racing pirates along a path by playing path-matching cards, with a clever movement mechanism. No text.


* Ingenious - Tile-laying, visually pretty, interesting strategically, easy rules, scales well, should be great for people who like abstract games, no text at all.

* Coloretto - Simple rules, interesting set collection and press-your-luck strategies. No text. Good blend of strategy and luck. 
zombie dice is very simple and quick.

another good one could be exploding kittens, an easy card game where the goal is to not play an exploding kitten card
Thanks, everyone!
We've been playing Zeus on the Loose at family things, just because I happened to pick it up at Value Village. Simple card game with a bit of "take that"itude. Sushi Go is also easy to learn but interesting and a new mechanic for most (card drafting) without being too complicated. Others that have been suggested to me for family events are Dixit (or Mysterium), Codenames, One Night Ultimate Werewolf.
**6 Nimmt**. It means take 6. 

Deck of cards numbered from 1 to 104. There are 4 cards on the board and everyone gets a hand of 10. You all pick a card, reveal them simultaneously and play them from lowest to highest.

As you play a card you place it in the row it is closest to without going under. Eg. The first 4 cards are 4 25 56 and 73. You play a 55 and it goes next to the 25. If your card is lower than all the last cards in all rows you replace an entire row with your card and take the row to your score pile. 

If your card is the 6th card in a row you replace the row with your card and add it to your score pile (Hence take 6).

Repeat until all 10 cards are gone.

Scoring is simple. Each card has a number of moose heads on it.  You want to have the least moose heads in your score pile.

Plays 3-10 players easily. Box says 30 mins but I've had multiple games within 30 mins.

Literally all you need to read is the large number on the card. The moose head values are easily differentiated by colour too.
**Isle of Skye** and **Istanbul** are medium heavy euros that are playable under 1h. **Hansa Teutonica** is a little heavier and also playable in 1h, of course, if players do not have severe AP.

**March of the Ants** is a p good one!
Love Roll.  San Juan and Castles of Burgundy are also great. Consider Gold West.  It's on the top of my wish list.
Here are some games popular with my lunch group (some are out of print):

Isle of Skye

Glory to Rome

Ra

Medici

Glen More

Ginkgopolis

Agricola: Family Edition

Imhotep

Dominion

Race for the Galaxy
Hansa Teutonica is a quick and tense euro, highly recommend it

Dominion

Similar engine building to rollFTG - 8-9 mins per player, and just a real classic game. 
Harbour seems like a good choice here. Quantum, gold west, capital (2016), arcane academy.

**Mottainai**

**Ghost Stories**

**Five Tribes** if no one has AP. 
It typically comes down to player count.  Some that you should be able to complete in an hour with 3-4 players include:

**Worlds Fair: 1893**: sharp little worker placement + area control game.

**Via Nebula**: Fantasy themed route building, pickup and deliver game about rebuilding a village

**Palaces of Carrara**: mechanically straight forward but thinky game that has you deciding between buying bricks, building buildings and scoring your buildings.

**Royals**: fantastic area control game that plays 2-5
**Sail to India** is a great choice here.

It's a cube management game as you have a number of workers who could represent your ships, money and victory points.
The Ancient World is a gorgeous worker placement game that dosn't get much buzz. It is set in a fictional world where you have to collect the favors of different tribes by either building different constructions or send armies to slay the local titans. 
**Imhotep** is a fun game that easily plays in under an hour. 

**Santiago de Cuba** would also meet your requirements. 
I may repeat some already found here, but here are my recommendations:

**Gold West**
**Discoveries**
**world's Fair 1893**
**Port Royal**
I think one rule I got wrong the first time or two was that when you go to the foreign office to get papers for your cousins, you get *all* of them, up until the current round, not just the next one cousin.
ANY imps you send to the podium, stay there. So if you use that action with two imps, you don't get back either of them.

Often I see people choose to do that action with two imps and then take back one of them at the end of the round. Nope, they both stay until used.
When one pet retires from the older pet board, you add a meat to the meat stand (you totally chop him in pieces regardless of what the manual says)

The minions in the selling platform stay there until they are used.

A minion group doesn't have to go. You can change your mind and let them stay.

Food doesn't accumulate.

Remember that freshly bought minions can't be sold. Also they always grow up by 2 years/levels in the next round after they were bought in the previous one. 
Be sure to double check that all needs cards are spent for each need required and that you have the correct amount of cards left over after needs are met. 

Potions can goof this up as you need to discard the need you are replacing with the potion. 

I have played a few games where someone will suddenly exclaim "How come I have extra needs cards?"
When you sell a pet, you can use an imp that's standing on the podium to boost the vp gains from 2x to 3x. However, this can only be used once on the final round, despite there being two dungeon lords available to sell to.
I highly recommend taking a look at Meeple Like Us ( http://meeplelikeus.co.uk ). They do great reviews focused on accessibility for people with conditions like color blindness. May be a good resource for future purchases.
Well there is the occasional post here where people analyze boardgames in regards to accessability. These posts have entries for the colourblind as well.

But the examples you gave us for the stuff your dad likes arent super helpfull since you wrote that he likes FPS ... and that is a genre impossible to boardgames ;-) 

I would like to suggest to try **Codenames**. It is really accessable doesnt have many game pieces, and is great fun. If the colours red / blue are an issue you could replace the blocker cards with ones better suited for his colourblindness.
**Dead of Winter** and **Fury of Dracula** are good games that do not rely on colour at all.

For something lighter you could try **Sushi Go!**, **Coup**, **Love Letter** or **Gloom**. Gloom has a different colour for each family, but this has no gameplay effect apart from identifying them during setup and can be ignored.
King of Tokyo / New York both require no colours and are light gateway games. 


Well, Killer Bunnies sucks. If he likes war games where he can take his time but are also action games, maybe he'd like **X-Wing Miniatures**. I don't think color is a big deal. Attack dice are red and defense dice are green, but just roll them in different spots and no worries. Plus, there's only 1 shared symbol on them, so easy to tell them apart anyway. **Small World** is a fun, quick moving area control game that, while a very colorful game in general, doesn't use color in any way for distinguishing players or player tokens or anything like that.
for abstract strategy, I recommend **Ingenious**. the colored pieces are explicitly designed with symbols so that colorblind folks are able to differentiate between the pieces.
If he has even a remote liking for chess, how about **Onitama**?
<sarcasm>Qwirkle</sarcasm>

I hate the colours in it.
Hive should be fine.  Kahuna. Lie. Dixit. Bang the dice game. Jamaica. Forbidden desert. Samurai spirit. Sheriff of Nottingham. Sushi go. Tides of time.plenty of options
Patchwork.  It's tetris and a light bit of econ & denial.  Odd theme but has some solid legs
I would recommend **Patchwork** for 2 reasons : 

- First it is an easily accessible game for non-gamers, I introduced it to my sister and mother last week end and the absolutely LOVED it, while not being used to boardgames. 

- I think it should be ok for colourblind since the game revolves around shapes rather than colors (who cares about having a nice patchwork as long as you win ;-)  ) Maybe just help him track which pawn is his, or you could mark one with a pen to differentiate the 2. 
Ticket to Ride might be a fit, with symbols on the cards to mark the different colors....
I'd suggest **Ticket to Ride**.
Our one of our LGS owners is colourblind and likes Five Tribes due to its color scheme.
Without knowing what kinds of things he might enjoy, it's hard to suggest a game. Cards? Strategy? Worker placement? Or do you just want gateway games that work for someone who is colorblind? 

Hive would work. Ticket to Ride: Europe would work. Hanabi. Fairy Tale. I have all those and can vouch for symbols in addition to colors. Jaipur and Lost Cities might also work? I haven't looked to closely at those cards but I believe all the colors have different designs. 

One of the **Zombicide** games might be a good place to start; it is a co-op game with scenarios and it isn't that difficult to learn. 
My game group has 2 people with color blindness.  We have learned to describe the colors or not use certain color player pieces on some games where it is hard to distinguish between them.  Most games now have been aware of the issue and added symbols along with the color to help but on some others we added dots or some other mark to tell the difference.  As long as the group is aware it can be overcome with very little effort most of the time.  Of course there has been a few games that may just be impossible   ... we just choose another game. It helps that one of the guys with the colorblindness has the largest collection of us all and picks a lot of our games.  In short if the group is understanding and the colorblind individual is not shy about asking for assistance when needed it normally is not an big deal.
Do you have a group you play regularly with? I think it's easier to show people how funny games can be when playing at groups instead of two player games.
Scythe is a color blind friendly game with great solo play! Sounds like it could be right up his alley!
Ticket to ride has colors and shapes for each of the trains. The I kg issue might be, he could mix up each players pieces unless you get the anniversary edition, or somehow label his problem colors. 
I am going to recommend the D&D board games,**(Castle Ravenloft, Wrath of Asherdalon, Legend of Drizzt)** because it seems like your dad likes campaign games.  These games are pretty light dungeon crawlers and are relatively cheap, so if he doesn't like them, then you aren't out too much money.  
I'm colorblind as well and do decently well with most games. The only game that doesn't work for me (and it's a shame because I really enjoy it) is Lords of Waterdeep. The black and purple cubes are too damn close in color.
Just be ready to accept that he just might not like board games. Obviously being colour blind is a barrier but maybe not the barrier that's actually stopping them.
Try a gateway game. **Ticket To Ride** is a great starter game and is very colourblind friendly as all the colours use symbols (just let him pick player colour first).

I'm pretty colourblind myself and there aren't a lot of games that I have problems with - for most of them, the colours are "open information" so I can double check if needed. The general policy is, as I stated before: let the colourblind people pick player colour first.
Carcassonne would probably work if you can find the colors of meeples that are different enough from each other (I find the blue and green are too similar in bad lighting) or mark some with dots or symbols with a Sharpie as others have mentioned
You have provided very little pertinent information. 

Which spectrum of colour blindness is he afflicted with, and how severe is it? Does he shut down at having to constantly process colours? 

Hack 'n' Slash and FPS, I would opine, are not genres you'd find in modern boardgames. Are there any other genres that interest him? 

What are his thoughts on boardgames apart from thinking they're all similar to Monopoly/Risk/Life? Does he like any aspect of them or hate everything about them?

I, too, am colour-blind. Red/Green deficiency. There are very few games, board or video, that are totally inaccessible. At a push, I would say only Grand Strategy or 4X games like Civilisations where having to constantly parse information via colour tires me out. 

Boardgames allow me the time to comfortably process coloured information. But so far, apart from Monopoly (Deal), I've not been having much trouble. 

Pandemic would be a good starting point. Red/Blue/Yellow/Black cubes for the diseases. No other differentiation needed. 

There is more control over gameplay, similar to GoW/FPS, whereby targets spawn in random numbers at fixed spawn points and players have to decide in what order, and with which appropriate skill choice, to eliminate said targets.

A dungeon crawl game like Zombicide may have some tenuous link to FPS-like on-the-fly decision-making. Targets constantly spawninh, players constantly repositioning and searching for loot, heavy dice-rolling simulate hitting/missing the targets in an FPS. There is almost no requirement for colour differentiation. Caveat: I have not played it, but only because I am awaiting Massive Darkness, which is similar on genre. 

Another user recommended Ticket to Ride. Another game I personally did not have much trouble with, and one I thoroughly enjoyed. Although the board may get too colourful for your dad. 

If there are certain combinations of colours that are impeding your father's enjoyment, and there aren't any symbols/shapes to help, you might want to help label the offending bits with small stickers, etc. 

My SO is aware of my colour-blindness and helps me with stuff like that. I have a group of friends who love Monopoly Deal, and whenever we play, I remind them that I'm not too savvy with colours and will constantly reaffirm certain colours with them. 


Depending on what type of colorblindness -- have you seen these glasses? http://enchroma.com/product-category/color-blindness-glasses/

They apply color filters on the wavelengths to better separate the red / green spectrum so your cones trigger separately.  
Try a heavier game. Many people do not like light games at all. 

I'd suggest Kemet, Posideon, Ophir or Food Chain Magnate
You've given us very little to go on. Twilight struggle perhaps? I don't know about color in that game
Honestly, you won't have issues with 90% of modern games. 

I've never met anyone that really enjoys **Killer Bunnies**... so that doesn't really tell me much.

You have soo many other options that are out there: **Dominion**, **Pandemic**, **Space Alert**, **Terra Mystica**.
Have you considered or looked into getting him a pair of EnChroma glasses? They are pricey at about $250-450 USD but from what I understand they can correct color blindness.

Effectively you'd be giving them the ability to possibly enjoy any game. Also colors. 


**Chess**
**Love Letter** is a classic
[**Bang!**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3955/bang), [**Citadels**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/478/citadels), and [**Coup**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup) all seem to fit your requirements of cheap, fast, and scalable. And fun, too, but I suppose that's a given.
**Anomia** would fit the bill! 3-6 players, fast, lots of yelling, and it's been a hit with other students for me. 
Fast paced? I think **Love Letter** is the standard in micro-games that can be played quickly, but extend over dozens of hands to take up a big chunk of the evening. The new Premium edition can handle up to 8 players. 

I'm also interested to try **3 Wishes**, which looks to have about the same size/pace but different mechanics. It can handle 3-4 people, which is kind of limiting, but Vassel's Dice Tower Review really intrigued me since he specifically said it was better than Love Letter.

If you're looking for something that is literally *frantic*, you could go with a real-time dice game like **Fuse**. It's not a micro-game, but is definitely portable. 10 minutes is the hard time limit on the game, otherwise the bombs go off and the game is over.

If the pace of the game isn't quite as important as I'm interpreting, I think social deduction games like **Coup**, **Resistance**, or **ONUW** are perfect for mixed groups of college age players. Coup can play as low as 3, while the others need groups of 5 or more, really. Generally these are over in 10-15 minutes and people can join in and leave as they like. But, because they require discussion and attention they're kind of dependent on what else is going on in the room.
Check out Sushi Go Party. 
+1 for **Lost Legacy**. There are many different sets, and we usually put two sets together. With two sets, you can play with 6 players.
+1 for Anomia, Sushi Go (Party), Love Letter, and One Night Ultimate Werewolf. Also Codenames, Dixit or Mysterium, maybe Munchkin for some relatively mindless fun, Carcassonne for a little more thinking but still relatively light, any of the Tiny Epic series, Harbour. Coup or Bang The Dice Game.
Does **Roll for the Galaxy** count? Because if so: **Roll for the Galaxy**.
Mine is still **Tiny Epic Galaxies**.

If you count **Castles of Burgundy** as a dice game, then probably it's CoB.
**Castles of Burgundy** and **Pandemic: The Cure**.
**Las Vegas**

**Würfel Bohnanza** (Bohnanza The Dice Game)

**Pandemic: The Cure**

**Roll for the Galaxy**

**Liar's Dice**
I'm a big fan of Cosmic Run, at any player count. But I do love my Castles of Burgundy and Shadow Hunters, if those count. 

Also throwing in Strike as a great quick filler. 
I have recently become a fan of **DC Comics Dice Masters**, but would have said before then **RoFTG.**
**King's Forge**. It's got just the right combination of strategy, dice luck, and simple rules. I love it for introducing people to board games, or as the first game with a new group.
**Roll for the Galaxy** is an obvious answer if you look at my flair. However my most recent acquisition was **Voyages of Marco Polo** and it's had my group very intrigued. 
Roll for It! has been a lot of fun and easy to teach. A great party game when you combine two sets. 
Co-OP: Elder sign

Competitive:  Troyes
**Liar's Dice**

http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/272142814349-0-1/s-l1000.jpg

Buy one of these and you are good to go with up to 7 players or more if you start everyone with 4 or less. Once you go beyond 4 players though, I very much recommend the splash damage rule where if the bid is exact, everyone except the correct person loses a die, except if they have 1 left. Otherwise, a 7 player game will take 35 turns. I turn the rule off if 4 players are remaining.

The other option I am considering is giving everyone 4 dice in a 5 player game and 3 dice if we are playing with 6-8 and 2 dice with 9-10.
**Castles of Burgundy** and **Roll for the Galaxy** are certainly up there for me.  I'd also like to mention **Troyes** -- it uses dice in an interesting and somewhat unique way, plus I just love the artwork.


**Castles of Burgundy** and **Troyes** when it comes in the mailbox tomorrow! AAAAH, can't wait. Can't wait for **Grand Austria Hotel** to hit a print run. I'm not that cult of the new. 
I recommend Quantum. Not a smaller game per say but a great game which uses dices. 
**Fuse** - Ten minute cooperative game where you solve puzzles with dice from a shared pool. Great tense fun.
100% it's **Blueprints**. It's far more interesting than "roll dice and see what happens". You always have choice as it's a dice drafting game and you're pulling from a pool of many. 

Guys. This is a diabolically simple but brilliant little game. Skip a few  pint and  check it out. 


**Seasons.** I bought Seasons, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Hansa Teutonica, and Glass Road around the same time because I had been buying lots of very long and/or heavy games and I wanted something else to scratch a similar itch as Castles of Burgundy or Istanbul without being either of those. I didn't think we'd love Seasons, I thought it was an  inexpensive alternative that was different.

Seasons is now one of my most played games. The more you play it, the better it gets. I've never been so surprised by the mileage I got out of a game before...

**Edit:** Also, **Castles of Burgundy**. Forgot that it's actually a dice game. I don't usually think of it as a dice game even though it has dice as a central  mechanic. As far as we're concerned, CoB is one of the best games ever with insane replay value.

 Honorary mention goes to **Bang: The Dice Game** because it takes the card game and does most of the same things... Except the game ends before you stop having fun. Bang dice is brilliant and a great backup game to have.
Roll for the Galaxy, Pandemic: The Cure, Bang! The Dice Game, Cosmic Run, Kingsburg, Dice City, Marvel Dice Masters: Ultimate X-Men. I also really liked Dungeon Roll, though I haven't played it recently.
Dungeon Dice
You Want a beautiful and challenging game try Dead men tell no tales.
For something quick and light, I would go with either **Qwixx** or **Wurful Bohnanza**. If I want something a little meatier I would go with **Discoveries**. Honorable mention to **Quantum**. I love that game quite a bit but I never see it as a Dice game. 
Tiny Epic Galaxies. I love the travel size box
**Grand Austria Hotel**

**Dead of Winter**

Either end of the Euro/Ameritrash spectrum :)
Kind of surprised there's only been one mention of **Elder Sign** so far. With all the FFG/Arkham hype I was kind of expecting to see that game get a bump in popularity (on the coattails of the LCG). With the added content from the expansions and a simple recipe-filling dice mechanic, it seems like the perfect gateway (and bridge) game for anyone looking to start moving into Lovecraft games.
Elder Sign. 
Solo: **Tiny Epic Galaxies**  
Co-op: **Elder Sign**  
Real-time: **FUSE**  
**las vegas, favor of the pharaoh, and strike** come to mind. :)
I like **Bang! The Dice Game** and have been playing with my gaming club after school (3-6th grade).

I also like **Qwixx**.  It's so easy to get people into it and surprisingly fun for a simple dice game.
My all-time favorite is Elder Sign, but I just got Pandemic: The Cure for my birthday and it's pretty good! Also, an expansion just came out for it so I might have to get that...
**Seafall** (though Dix Mille is great)
Star Wars Destiny, and it isn't even out yet!
So my friends and I really liked La **Granja: No Siesta.**
Right now it's **Thief's Market** is a fantastic tiny box game that creates interesting situations and lots of fun.

I'm also helping out a friend with his soon to be printed game called **Top Kitchen**. It takes all the really fun elements of **King's Forge** and takes out some of the more annoying elements of stealing other players works.

I also really enjoy **Roll for the Galaxy** and **Quantum** if those two count.

I would like to warn people about **No Siesta**. It's pretty monotonous and doesn't lend itself to many interesting plays. I mean, you might like it as an idea the first two or three times, but it's going to quickly turn into the same game over and over again. There is little to no interaction and the choices you make play to a strategy you choose early and then plays out almost exactly as you planned every time. It's just... blegh.
I guess the closest to a dice game for me would be **The Voyages of Marco Polo**.
**Coffee Roaster**, for the time being. It's just a fun bag-builder kinda thing, and I love coffee, and have even roasted it myself before. Others that I also love to play solo:

* Friday
* Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective
* Onirim
* Sylvion
* Multiuniversum
* Viticulture
* New Bedford
* The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game
* Ascension (Dreamscape, specifically, but all I have played are good)
* Roll for the Galaxy (unofficial variant)
* 51st State: Master Set
* Pandemic: The Cure
* Fleet (unofficial variant based on Arctic Bounty)
* The Game
* Hostage Negotiator (hard!)
* Space Hulk: Death Angel (hard, but doable!)
* Star Trek: Frontiers (always feels daunting, so I often give up before I start... I need to play more)

Soon, I am sure I'll be adding Castellion, Nautilion, Black Orchestra, Attack on Titan, Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy, The Networks, and Robinson Crusoe to the list.

I am about to play **New Bedford** solo, so that might be on the list. It seems it should play nicely.

EDIT: Yep, New Bedford is great! You can play against 1-3 AI Captains in the solo mode, too, which is kinda unique.
This question gets asked almost everyday and the answers are always the same. We should really have some sticky or right side bar link for it.
Mage Knight - Hands down my favorite.

Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective - Don't play to beat Sherlock, just play to solve the case.

Honorable Mention: Robinson Crusoe - I have not played it but have heard great things about it.
Mage Knight Board game and LOTR LCG! 
Probably gonna get Onirim, and i still got Robinson Crusoe, Gears of War
I also adore **Mage Knight**. My other favorite heavy solo game is **Falling Sky**, though any of the COIN games are supposed to be just as good or close enough. Other good games that I don't like quite as much, primarily because of their reliance on dice resolution, are **Darkest Night**, **Dawn of the Zeds**, and **Gears of War** (which is sadly OOP).

For quick games I actually prefer both of the other games in the Oniverse series, **Sylvion** and **Castellion**, to Onirim, if only because of the absurd amount that Onirim makes you shuffle the deck. I also really like **Deep Space D-6**, as well as a couple games with Looney Pyramids, specifically Color Wheel and Solomids.
It's either **La Granja** or **Agricola**. To me there is something meditative about trying to solve the puzzles they set you up for and try to squeeze out a little more VP than the last time. Also the games run for a fixed number of rounds so you know when you'll be done.
I know a lot of people on this sub find these dry beat-your-own-score boring so you got to know whether you like that or not.
I do also enjoy **Freedom - The Underground Railroad** but that one is so brutally hard and dark it's not one I pull out very often. Still I enjoy myself immensely when I do.

I'm also looking forward to the new edition of **Robinson Crusoe** :)
**Terraforming Mars** is the only game I own, that I played more than one solo session (actually played 7 sessions iirc).

So by definition this makes it my favorite solo game.
Star Trek: The Dice Game
FRIDAY FRIDAY ITS FRIDAY!
Arkham Horror LCG has moved to top of list.  Great mix of careful card play and RPG scenarios, with just enough deck tweaking to make it my own.  Fantastic two-player co-op too, which is a bonus on the rare occasions I can get someone else.
Scythe
Kingdom Death: Monster. The control of an entire colony and multiple survivors while individually designing each one in a vicious world appeals to me.
For the newbs(new to the hobby):  never turn down a game, try everything, no matter what the theme/genre.  You may be surprised.


Read the manual again after having played. It really helps find errors in how you played and solidify the rules in your head.
Don't buy 20 gateway games in your first few months. You'll regret 3/4 of them.
Drinks off the table!
Buy games that others will enjoy. Otherwise, you'll own a large, expensive collection of shelf decorations.
Read the rules *before* you have to teach a game.
A mediocre game where everyone has fun is better than a great game where half the table is pissed at each other two hours after it ends
Play to have fun and be positive throughout the game.  Then others will be more likely to have fun and continue to play games with you and even invite you to their game nights for more merriment.
If you are having trouble picking that last card up off the table, just slide another card under it. No need to chip the edges with fingernails, slide it to the edge of the table, or try to stick something to it. This trick works every time.
To quote Knizia 
>When playing a game, the goal is to win, but it is the goal that is important, not the winning.

Some people might forget that. 
Always check underneath the table before you leave. 
Respect another person's game!  Treat cards, money, etc. as if YOU'RE the one that'll be paying for any replacements.

Also, don't slam the dice cup down on the table, causing knocked-over pieces and heart attacks!  No one's impressed by your ability to hit a table with a cup.
Make bags/boxes that contain a players start materials, where something is variable (increasing money on player order etc.) put the minimum in and deal with the difference later
Always remember that games are supposed to be fun.
**Play them**.
Play the game by yourself before you introduce it to others. No one wants to listen to you read rules *at* them. Understand the game so well that you can teach a "big picture" approach to the game, rather than rattle off a litany of minutiae.
Don't take losing personally. Took me many years and I wish I had learnt it earlier in life. 
Ramakins ramakins ramakins. Go to a discount store (I go to Big Lots), buy cheap ramakins (3 for $1), put your components in them while you play.
Go to the dollar store and pickup a pack of small containers to keep small board game pieces in.  Makes setup and takedown of games really quick.
Silicone Muffin Cups.  They're awesome for holding random cardboard bits.

If you're doing booze and board games, keep it light. I don't think Lords of Waterdeep was supposed to take 3 hours to play...
Carefully plan out exactly what games you want to buy, and figure out the maximum you are willing to spend. Them realize this is the minimum amount. Enjoy all your new games!
Be helpful, friendly and positive. Hard to go wrong with this.
Always start a rules explanation with what the goal is. Makes explaining the how much smoother.
Buy [these](https://www.amazon.com/Organizer-Storage-With17-Compartments-Bobbins/dp/B007R571L2). Lots of them. One for any game that has a lot of components. Unless the game is very small or has an insert that can't be discarded, these are absolutely fantastic for storing and sorting components. They're especially ideal for Fantasy Flight products because you almost always want to throw out the insert that came in the box.
Have fun. 
Find a group on meetup.com.  Bigger gatherings mean more chances to play what you want versus just accepting what your close friends or spouse want to play.
Think about what you play with whom. I thought Sherif of Nottingham was going to work with anyone but I have some friends who just did not enjoy it at all, due to their heavy preference for cooperative games.
Play board games with your kids. They will benefit from it more than you realize. 
When playing with children check out BGG forums they sometimes give great advice and setup family rules to make the game easier and more fun for them.
Never put couples on the same team. Don't do it. Unless they comprise of a team bigger than just them.



Also attempting to learn a game after people come over for a boardgame night is like going to get the groceries after people come over for a dinner date. Get your crap together and prepare in advance. 
Go for the strategy no one goes for and don't stand out.
If you play with a group, never buy a game that someone else in the group already owns unless you have a deep need to play it with people outside the group.
Dont forget to have fun. you want to enjoy the games, not suffer through them
I think the best board game tip is the one on the Looney Pyramids. Step on one and you will need stitches.
Personally, if you are teaching a game at the table try to make it as succinct as possible. Players learn best when they get a chance to actually play the game. Sure there may be a number of special conditions or viable strategies, but those can be explained as players run into them. 

When playing a competitive game I'll let first time players know that this is a learning experience and not to worry about winning. We can always startup a 2nd game and get competitive once they fully grasp what is happening.

The worst is when people explain each individual card or character. I tend to lose interest extremely fast. 
Only douchebags snap cards when they lay them on the table.  Unless you're playing some poker or something with a cheap 99 cent deck and you've got a sweet hand.
It sounds like you really like thematic games. You might want to check out [this bgg list](https://boardgamegeek.com/thematic/browse/boardgame). Perhaps **Shadows Over Camelot**, **Fury of Dracula**, or **Blood Rage** would be up your alley.
May I suggest dead of winter??  It is in most respects a coop like many of the games you cite, although it has the defector which makes it unlike anything you have listed.  It has a strong theme, like all of your games.  It has a little bit of an RPG feel to it.  It's also just a really fun game IMO.  I would recommend you check it out if you get the chance and can pull together the right group.
Have you tried cosmic encounter? You might like the theme and the aliens.
Dude, this game is fantastic with 6. But, someone has to be good at multitasking. It was a bit daunting for me managing both Captain and First Officer. =[
Is it worthwhile with 6? Absolutely. But make sure that it is a good fit for your group. It is a rather unique game, and unless everyone in your group falls in love with it you will have a hard time getting it to the table.
Probably an unpopular opinion, but I think it's best at 6. First mate doesn't feel like a full role to me, so I like it combined with Captain.

Overall, I love this game!
Its fine at 6, since two of the roles can be easily combined. I wouldnt go lower than that though
The turn-based variant make it great with any number, even with just 2
I've played it with six.

As Captain, I found it very difficult to remember to mark the First Officer sheet.  When I shifted over the Engineer, I had to keep reminding the new captain to mark the sheet, so I was not alone in having that problem.
I concur with what most here said already. Great game at 6 and 8 (haven't tried lower yet).

You can combine the Captain and First Mate quite easily, but some people are naturally bad at multitasking. It's one of those games whereby you can just be unfit for a certain role/tactic :P. That's not a big problem, since there are plenty of roles ;).

I've had a friend who after a few minutes of being the captain asked to be releaved, because he thought it was stressful. He made a great engineer though!
Has anyone tried playing this game with the captain and engineer combined? I feel like there would be a lot of synergy with the two roles knowing what is happening, but then again it could also be very daunting and mayhem-ridden.
Yes. It's quite good with six (although I wouldn't play with fewer than six).
We combined Engineer and First Mate instead of Captain and First Mate.
Late to the game here but I have only ever been able to field six and it was an absolute blast. Keep in mind some of the people who tried to duel role captain and first mate felt overwhelmed. Just be flexible and find what works. 
I've played it at 8p, 6p, and most recently, 4p—all in real time. As others have said, it really depends on your group, but the game itself is a blast at all player counts. It feels a little different at each count (at 4p, I was captain, first mate, and engineer—so there was a lot of me shouting at no one in particular. "HEAD NORTH OKAY OKAY. HEAD EAST OKAY TORPEDOES CHARGED OKAY.")

My one suggestion is that you get in a couple games at 8p if at all possible—once everyone understands how the roles work on their own, it's a lot easier to condense down to smaller player counts without a bunch of, "Wait, so first I have to do this...and then this? And what does this do?"
I found the game better with 6 than with 8, when we played with 8 the first officer was always bored.
Damn good game for just 6. Actually a little easier.
This is how we play **Tales of the Arabian Nights**, but that's technically a house rule.
**Concept.** They even put in the rulebook most people don't bother playing for points, just have fun guessing stuff until you're done playing.
**Space Hulk: Death Angel**. There are no winners, because there is no winning... Oh... that's not what you meant. There was a [discussion about this](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1267450/sandbox-games-definitionexamplestop-10-possibility) on BGG a while ago that wasn't very helpful. 


The closest that I have played is **Tales of Arabian Nights**, which definitely has a winner and several losers, but the fun of that game has nothing to do with winning, losing, or even trying to win; the fun is in exploring the world and choosing your character's destiny (for better or worse).

DnD?
**Fiasco** - just pure roleplay
Global Thermonuclear War
Lego?
Maybe not quite the answer you're looking for but **Telestrations** doesn't really have scoring or winners or points. It's mostly just having a laugh with your friends.

(I think there might be a scoring system in the rules book but I've never seen anybody use it over the years) 
I hear people often just sandbox around in **Firefly** without focusing on the objective, it does have a winner and an end, but it's rarely the focus I guess?
So there's games like Arkham/Elridtch Horror where everyone wins or loses together. To that end it and table top RPGs are what my friends and I play a lot. We're competitive too but mostly with video games. 

And in those games there is no real losing to me. Even when the board beats you it tells an awesome story however tragic. And playing, not winning, is the real goal. 
**Galaxy Trucker** is interesting, in that you win if you end the game with any money. Who cares how much money anyone else made, you've accomplished the goal of the game and therefor you win.
You can play games like **Concept**, **Cards Against Humanity**, and **Dixit** without really keeping score and just use them as a medium for social engagement, but I don't think that's what you're asking about.

I think with most bigger games people are generally looking for some kind of "point" or goal to work towards. If nothing else it at least defines a stopping point. You're basically talking about a game with no win condition. It could probably be argued that what you are describing isn't even really a "game" in the traditional sense.

I don't mean any of this derogatorily. I think it's a really interesting question. 

The closest thing I can think of is **Kingdom Death: Monster**. It's a long campaign style game. It does have an eventual end of sorts, mostly because if you survive that long you eventually kind of run out of content. It's not really designed to be played all the way through in a single go, though. You come back and pick up where you left off and continue trying to survive. 
I think technically you could make SimCity end. Once you had some critical mass of the highest cost Arcologies, they'd all blast off into space. 

But the answer to your question is no, there aren't really any like that. 
We never keep score in concept. :)
Once upon a Time 
If you like storytelling. This game is great. There are winners and losers but it doesn't matter who wins, it's just amazing for talking great stories. I've only played a handful of times with my group but people still reminisce about it. 
I wouldn't suggest playing it with ultra competitive people. They can ruin the experience 
**Winter Tales** kinda.... it's meant to be more story telling than a winner. There are gameplay elements but it's almost easier to just play it RPG style. 
**The Quiet Year** - It's an open ended collaborative map building game which each player takes the role of a key decision maker in a post apoc soceity.
There are only losers after a round of CAH.
**Robinson Crusoe** because your group inevitably dies :p


Check out Archipelago. It's pretty sandboxey, and you can play it so that everyone wins as long as the natives don't rebel. But still there is a "kinda" winner.
**Monopoly**.  I mean, seriously... has anyone ever actually finished a game?  :)
Even Minecraft has an ending... But this is a really interesting thought. 
I guess you can make a fair point that **Monopoly** has no winners..
Locking is better i think. The biggest issue is warping. If any of the pieces warp and they almost inevitably will, it's just that much less enjoyable to use. Unless it's going to break the bank i would say go for a mounted folding board. They always feel worth the money to me. Make something else in the game cheaper if you need to but the board matters more than almost anything else. 
Locking almost always ends up more awkward. Probably more expensive for you too. Keep it simple.
Folding boards are infinitely better than either option, but it kind of depends on the game. If you're moving pieces across the board all the time, cards can get hung up awkwardly on puzzley bits if they warp. Tzolk'in has a great puzzle board, but something like Empire Builder's annoys me trying to draw on it lol. 

I'd do a prototype of both options and see which one you like 
Non locking is probably going to be way cheaper because with jigsaw pieces you will probably need another die, and you risk major returns if you have a problem with the die being misaligned by even a small amount, which people can manually fix with square boards. I play wiz-war pretty often (square boards) and have no issues with the board moving around too much. The larger the boards are the less of an issue it will be. No problems with that Star Wars game or Scythe (big board) either. 
The board for **Catan** works really well where there's locking exterior pieces that hold in all of the other pieces and prevent them from moving around at all.
The only multi-piece board I can think of playing is the big version of Scythe's board. They initially supplied clips to hold them together, but apparently those broke easily -- I've never used them. The two boards lying side to side has always worked fine.
My go to recommendation if you liked Catan is always Carcassonne. Hits pretty much all your points and scales well if you want to play more than 2 players.  Lots of expansions if you want to increase that pile of rules but easy to learn from the start.  

Beforwarned.  My family/gaming group got started with Catan and I picked up Carcassonne for my brother that christmas.  I can look back on that night (I got it for him because I wanted to try it) and know it was when my boardgame addiction started.  I'm always trying to find that next Carcassonne.
Patchwork! Very easy to get to the table, simple in concept but a lot of strategy involved. Light rules. Nothing to do with sci-fi or fantasy. 
Let me be the first to suggest **Castles of Burgundy** as a game that is not sci-fi/fantasy, competitive but not cutthroat, quite directly in middle weight and plays great with 2 but can accommodate up to I believe 4.
Fields of Arle i think may be too complex. It is certainly a "pile of rules". I would say you should approach that game by first playing *Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small* first. The games have the same theme and are both 2 player only, and are by the same designer, but Agricola ACBS is much simpler.  Do not confuse *Agricola: All creatures big and small* with regular *Agricola* which is a more complex and expensive multiplayer game. 
7 Wonders Duel or Agricola All Creatures Great and Small (2 player version)
The answer to this question is always **Patchwork** :)
Look into these and see if you like the ideas: Hive, Machi Koro (similar to Catan's dice rolling and you can choose how competitive you want to be with your cards), CV is simple to learn and has fun artwork, Age of War is super portable and is a hit with everybody I've shown it to(and it can play up to 6!), Beyond Baker Street, Mission Red Planet, Tsuro, Splendor 
Welcome! This is a very common request, so we've put together a handy wiki Page called [What Should I Get [WSIG]?](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig#wiki_new_to_designer_boardgames). It's also linked in the sidebar to the right of this post. -------------------->

You might want to start out with [2-Player Games](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig/two_player) or the more general [New to Designer Boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig/new) sections. There are some good recommendations in there.
**Jaipur** is by far my favourite two player game. Easy to pick up, quick to play, reasonable amount of strategy and decision making without too much complexity. Nice bright look and feel to it and a nice theme to boot.

Bear in mind it is a two-player only game so wouldn't work for larger groups.
7 Wonders: Duel I think would be the best fit. It's not too complex, but not overly simple.
Welcome to the wonderful world of modern board gaming!


Since you're relatively new to the hobby, below are a few recommendations that are the "classic" (or at least modern classic) 2-player recommendations that will ensure you both have a ton of fun without overwhelming you.


• **Jaipur** - A fantastic card game that has you and your opponent trying to make smart trades to create efficient "sets" of commodities that can then be sold for a premium. Great fun and a modern classic!


• **Hive** - Two-player games tend to veer towards the "abstract" end of the spectrum (i.e.: without much of a theme), and this game stands tall among the others in the genre. A lot of people refer to it as "insect chess", but don't let that scare you away. This is a fantastic strategic tile laying game that is well-regarded by many gamers.


• **Pandemic** - It isn't two player only (plays up to 4), but is the quintessential "cooperative" game. You think competing is fun? Try working together to rid the world of nasty diseases.


• **Battle Line** - Simple, yet deeply strategic. This is one of the greatest two-player games ever made by one of the greatest board game designers - Reiner Knizia. You are competing with your opponent to make poker-like sets of cards to claim flags on the battle line. So elegant and so good.


Hope that helps. Let us know what you finally decided to play/buy and how you enjoyed the games. Have fun!
