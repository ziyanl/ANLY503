Having posted a couple of days ago on the double slit experiment, which is weird, I was posted in the direction of the delayed quantum eraser experiment - which is even worse! But so interesting. 

So it got me wondering what would happen if you modified the experiment a little. Background by the way is in biomedical sciences - my physics is high school level! And the video reference is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7Z_TIw9InA, with the experiment described around 10 minute mark.

Ok. So you fire a particle from the beam, its split into two by the first prism and one lands at detector D0. Lets say you don't get any signal registered at either D3 or D4, and its heading to the third mirror BSC.

At present, you'd say the particle would produce an interference pattern. It's already landed at D0 so can't change where it turns up. So what happens if you take away the mirror BSC after the particle has been detected at D0? You could easily stick the last part of the apparatus on the moon 1.3 light seconds away. You'd then know which slit the original father of the entangled twin particles went through. But it'd be too late to collapse the interference pattern?

Equally - if you refrained from meddling with the experiment but put all of the bottom half of the experiment on the moon and fired out a particle at intervals...would you be able to tell in advance the behavior of each moonbound particle at the first splitter, based on the signal detected at D0 from its twin, before the 1.3 seconds it took to get there and land at D1, 2 3 or 4? If it landed in an interference pattern, does that mean somehow it 'already knows' its twinned partner is going to pass through the first splitter when it eventually arrives there?

Imagine a room that's circular, the walls having copper wiring like an alternator and there is a spinning horizontal rod in the center of the room with a magnet on either end, would this generate electricity.?
This seems like a pretty bold claim backed up by not the most evidence. /u/verylittle, /u/robusetceleritas, is this reasonable?

Also, what the hell is going on in that figure 1.
Any nuclear physicists care to comment on this? Triple nuclear collision seems like a bit of a stretch to me, but I don't know enough to really comment.

Also couldn't this be fairly easily tested in an anvil cell?
Let's not forget that this is the journal which recently published a paper arguing against accelerated cosmic expansion. Not exactly sure where nature scientific reports are going, but the general direction seems to be "against accepted wisdom" (and in the case of cosmic expansion "against most of the data". Don't know enough to make the same attack against this paper though.)
I'd like to see what /u/Greebo24 thinks as well.

>In 2004 the facility was modified to include a catapult launch with an initial speed of 168 km/h, giving it twice the freefall time but making the facility at least eight times as cool.

We're definitely the target audience for this article here. Fully agree with that sentence.
But can it launch a 90kg projectile over 300 meters? Only a trebuchet can do that.
My father used to work for ESA in Bremen in the 80s and did some work at that tower. Though as an engineer not really focusing on the physics aspect of the facility.
Why the catapult? Why don't they have a lift that just drops the experiment from the top?
Grad student in experiment here.

There are some days when I'm at my computer all day and some where I'm not sitting at my desk for a single minute.

Lots of programming for data analysis and simulations. I have to know some nuclear physics (obviously), some electronics, some statistics/data analysis, some accelerator/beam physics, some detector physics, etc.

I do my analysis in ROOT, and most simulations in GEANT4, if you're familiar with them.

So when I'm not at the computer doing analysis, I'm messing around with detectors, electronics, cryogenics, things like that.

It's s lot of fun. I'm really interested in all the theory (especially nuclear theory of course), but I like to actually be able to get my hands dirty too. I like the balance a lot. I think experimental nuclear physics has a very bright horizon. It's a good field to get into in the next few years.
/u/RobusEtCeleritas gives a pretty good overview of experimental physics.  What tends to vary is the balance among the different topics.  I spend a lot of time on analysis and simulations, with little hands on time, and I've got colleagues that have a very different balance of those things.
Pretty much the same as /u/RobusEtCeleritas , with even less focus on actually tinkering with detectors since I'm part of a large collaboration.  For stuff related to the detector I usually change/fix software needed to correctly use raw data.
>needless to say...
Not quite. While many of us have indeed had those rage-inducing struggles, it never goes without saying.

Anyway... I would suggest to take a break and let yourself cool down for a bit. Might be a day or two, might be a semester or more. That's okay. But use that time to try to understand yourself and what it is that got you so worked up. And answering that question with "physics" is a bit of a cop out. There is always something about yourself contributing to the difficulty, whether you are willing to admit it or not.
Office hours and study groups
Physics class definitely takes some getting used to. I had the benefit of taking Intro physics a few times in community college. It was overwhelming and I had to drop it at least once. And then another time I retook it and got a C only because of some generous curving by the professor. And in that time I've seen a lot of A students going through the same thing despite putting in twice as much time for the class as they were for any other.

We get these questions fairly frequently, so instead of typing everything out again, read [my comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/50f9mr/how_should_i_study_physics/d73ogbn/) on suggestions for how to get through it a bit easier.
Get "the streetwise guide to calculus." Remember, calc originated FROM physics to describe natural phenomena. Really try to understand calculus concepts on a fundamental level, i.e what does it mean to take a derivative, how can you derive kinematics equations, etc 
This guy got internet strangers to give him 35,000 dollars to work on quantum gravity problems? That's amazing.

RemindMe! in 20 years: Check wikipedia if Is QHD gravity still a thing.
From the linked post:

>What I find particularly interesting about this is that with a theory based on the QHD algebra we do not appear to learn anything of existential significance. Stephen Hawking talks about “knowing the mind of God” as a spin-off from a final theory, ***but if nature should have chosen a theory based on the QHD algebra then there does not seem to be any message — divine or secular — to be found in it but rather an awkward sense of the trivial. No deep revelations about reality, no supersymmetry, no extra dimension and no “everything is made of… tiny bananas!” An algebra, that simply encodes how stuff is moved around in space, is something so ordinary that it could have been written down ages ago and does not seem quite worth the struggle of finding it.*** This is precisely the reason I believe that this would be a most interesting finale to that scientific quest, which the ancient Greeks started several millennia ago.

Regardless of whether or not this particular theory is correct, I think this is an interesting comment regardless. It's more than likely that a unified theory will be heavily mathematically based.

I mean, what exactly do we expect to find from such a theory? Is it the expectation (or hope) of some grand revelation, or simply the ambition to fully describe the laws of nature for the sake of the endeavour itself?

Perhaps way way later down the line, we can find practical and experimental predictions from such a theory.
so r/physics... is this a meme or not? 

I just really like theoretical physics, but I guess not so much that I'd be willing to study it for 8 years to comprehend the details of something like this. Any Physics Gods on this sub care to enlighten us dumbass laymen lurkers?
Ok, undergrad interested in theoretical physics here. I am currently doing an advanced QM course at my university and have knowledge of the basics of algebras and special relativity.

Before I dig in, two questions:

1) What more prerequisites do I need to understand the paper?

2) How big of a deal would this be, if their theory turns out to be correct/consistent with observations?
Empty is right, this sounds like a nice framework but one that is completely lacking in predictive power. It seems like all they're doing is recasting regular QFTs + gravity as a single thing, without contributing anything to what those regular QFTs should look like. If it contains the Standard Model that's cool, but unless it also demands the existence of a [fixion](https://xkcd.com/1621/) I'll stick with the time-honored "throw shit at a wall and see what sticks" method of developing theories.
>Our analysis suggests that such a theory exist.

>An algebra, that simply encodes how stuff is moved around in space, is something so ordinary that it could have been written down ages ago and does not seem quite worth the struggle of finding it.

Does the analysis "suggest" pretty strongly? Are they just being humble, or are they not quite sure of their conclusions yet?
1st year, second semester physics man here. 
What does X denote in this situation. Just got done learning magnetism now getting into wave's of electrical fields. 
"I know e^x is a exponential function and also the inverse of LN(x)."
But what is uppercase x? Roman numeral for the number ten? I hypothesis naaay! If you could do those TPS reports that'd be great. 

Nice.

Next on the theory check list are prediction, experiment, discovery and repeat.

Let us know if you need help (I may need to brush up on algebra first).

I really despise all of these theory of everything crowdfunding bullshit. If you want to contribute to fundamental theoretical physics, then study, work out your shit, publish, and shut up about yourself. Like everyone else has done since theoretical physics exists. Yes, "the giants" too.
As a theoretical physics PhD student near the end of my degree, I can try and write something relevant. I'm doing pen and paper high energy theory, something quite close to pure mathematics. The work is a mix of reading the relevant literature, some by-hand computation, trying to solve the various problems that invariable arise, and discussions with co-workers and advisor. When you more or less understand enough for an article, you go through the painful work of writing a draft (usually, during this work you find a few things you actually don't understand, so more problem solving is usually required). Once you have a draft, you rewrite and polish it for a while, before submitting to arXiv and some journal. Then you start thinking more about the next project, and the process repeat. 


Personally, because of the subjects I've worked on, I've needed a fair bit of specialized math. However even for people doing high energy theory, this can vary quite a lot. Many (most) people don't need that much math, but they might need some very advanced computational techniques. Also, I've done zero coding during my PhD: at most I've used Mathematica to do some longer algebraic computations, but again this varies: some of my office mates complain that all they do is write code. 


For me, the work has been interesting and stimulating. There's been periods of intense work, when finishing projects and when there's a lot of discussion going on, but also periods with considerably less work, when you're sort of stuck, when starting a new project or when all your co-authors are away. About changing to experimental, for me that really doesn't feel feasible, the distance between any sort of experimental physics and high energy theory is just way too big. In general I think it's very hard to make any such large switch after finishing a PhD: if you're hiring postdocs, why would you ever hire a theory person when there's probably a large number of more qualified experimentalists applying for the same position? Same thing goes the other way around as well. When doing research, you're usually very specialized. Even switching from say high energy theory to particle physics theory (which to non-experts probably sound like exactly the same thing) is probably not too easy depending on what exactly you've done. 
An electron has a relatively short mean free path in air at STP (I can't remember off the top of my head, but less than a few centimeters). Any photography would have to be done in a vacuum chamber, which is exactly why a transmission electron microscope operates at high vacuum. Magnetic fields are used as lenses to focus the electron beam (and in some cases raster it back and forth). It isn't exactly like Schlieren photography, but TEMs can do light field and dark field imaging.
The principle of electron paths bending in electromagnetic fields is how old CRT TVs and oscilloscopes work.   An electron beam is deflected by a controlled electric field to hit a particular point on a screen where a phosphor lights up.

On a color TV with a shadow mask acting as a grid, magnetic fields can produce schlieren-like effects.

You might also want to look into electron holography and electron microscopy.
Why do we use the Lagrangian? Try working it out with Newton's laws (no peeking at your Lagrangian equation of motion).

Lagrangians are much nicer because they're scalars, while forces are vectors. And Lagrangians use generalized coordinates, whereas forces have ugly transformation laws between coordinate systems, and they're only "straightforward" between simple coordinate systems (Cartesian, spherical, cylindrical, and a few others).
What is impulse based simulation? I've never heard of that, but I can infer what is going on here. What happens in studying chaotic systems is that we want to study directly the equations of motions because we can control the parameters to understand how chaotic behaviour arises. It is not about "seeing" such behaviour but actually measuring stuff, and for that you need to work with the actual equations. For instance you might check if a parameter causes bifurcations and of which kind, calculate the lyapunov exponent or check how the orbits are deformed by the nonlinear perturbation (see KAM theory). 

There is also the fact that we can check how precise the actual algorithm for the solution of the equation. A big problem in numerical simulations is, as you've said, that "fiddling with the time step results in different behaviour". That shouldn't be the case, we trust the math and the simulations must be independent of time steps or at least converge to an exact solution. There are many ways to check if the behaviour of the simulation has the same structure as the analytical solutions, in mechanics you would check for example energy or momentum conservation depending on your problem. This is why there are many different ways to solve numerical equations, ideally every single algorithm should give the same solution, but what actually happens is that some algorithms are better for specific kinds of problems.

>not just Eurocentric

You may be SOL there. Unless you don't consider the Soviet Union part of "Eurocentrism" you pretty much are limited to Japan post WW2 and India (up until quite recently). For Japan, the Kamiokande neutrino detector maybe?

http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/gallery/wme/sk_01h-wm.jpg

Though that was only built in the 90s.  The first Japanese Nobel Prize winner was Yukawa in 1949:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Yukawa

For India, Raman won it in 1930:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._V._Raman

There are also people like Yang and Lee who were Chinese, but did their work at American universities.  Tomonoga won the Nobel along with Feynman:

http://th.physik.uni-frankfurt.de/~jr/gif/phys/tomonaga2.jpg

Actually, as I've said, other than Japan, India (including Pakistan, as they were united when many Laureates were born) and Chinese working in the US, there's never been a non-"Eurocentric" Nobel Prize winner in Physics. At least not to my knowledge.

EDIT: If by non-"Eurocentric" you also just mean "not men" there have been a number of women who have made great contributions to physics in its history. Such as (I'm setting a time cut-off at about the 70s, obviously in the modern physics world there are many, MANY women doing great things): Curie (who you already said), Lise Meitner, Emmy Noether, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Chien-Shiung Wu.

You could also do the somewhat controversial practice of putting extreme emphasis on, objectively not very important, scientific contributions made by a number of women throughout the history of science, simply because they were done by women.  Saying it that way makes it sound like I'm being really negative about this approach, which isn't really the case, but if you want to do that you should understand you'll have to play a bit of revisionist history for how "crucial" some of these contributions were.  Like explaining how it was really really important that she translated the manuscript of some white dude mathematician into Italian and even added an appendix! And why you're focusing on her, if the work was so important, rather than the person who actually wrote the manuscript.  To this end the usual list, of which I'm sure you can find pictures is people like: Ada Lovelace, Marie Anne Lavoisier, Henrietta Leavitt, Emilie du Chateliete, Grace Hopper, Vera Ruben.

Not saying these people didn't do amazing things (oh I can just smell the downvotes a coming), but objectively, if they hadn't been women, there would be no way you would have heard of any of them.  Again I'm just saying this to be clear that if you go that route your students may question the signficance of the work.


Gotta have [Feynman](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/files/2014/07/feynman-bongos2.jpg)
I think the Current War between Telsa's alternating current vs. Edison's Direct Current is a really interesting part physics in history.  The politics involving it and the creation of the first ever electric chair is really intriguing.  
Of course! I am in graduate school, but I work with a company that has several scientists doing R&D into x-ray optics. It is very applied physics, but physics nonetheless!

Many large corporations hire physicists in a capacity where their degree is used. Some examples: IBM, Intel, Boeing, Raytheon, Micron, Honeywell, BAE Systems, and many others. A larger list is [here](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/career/who-hires.html) (but some of those are finance and other jobs).
David Morin's problems are quite difficult.  I recommend working in groups, and you'll probably want to spend hours on each one and check solutions only when you're done.
If it's a starred problem I would absolutely try to solve it but just remember that they are pretty difficult and usually require very special insights and you could spend weeks on it and never get it.

That said you should be able to get most of the other problems but you would really benefit from working on them with classmates. I spent several hours on my weekly problem sets when using this book and that was while collaborating with classmates.

Also his time dilation limericks are great.

> The effects of dilation of time

> Are magical, strange, and sublime.

> In your frame, this verse,

> Which you'll see is not terse,

> Can be read in the same amount of time it takes someone else in another frame to read a similar sort of rhyme.
As a rule of thumb, you should never check for solutions, even one or two lines. Of course, if you are studying on your own and have no peers, no teachers or no TAs, things are different.

The problem with looking at just one or two lines in the solution manual, is that you'll usually check the first lines... where all the physics is. The rest of the problem is usually just math that you can do by yourself.

At the very least, try something, write something down, try to develop your intuition, then check the solution and try to understand what you did wrong and why he did what he did.
If youre trying to solve these with high school level knowledge that is impressive.  It is a great book that teaches problem solving at the olympiad level with a good amount of mathematical sophistication.  Do not expect to solve all the problems in the book on your own but dont be daunted to know that some may take days of thinking on your own until it finally clicks.  My advice is to work through them and note the ones you get stuck on and skip them.  Come back to them later when youre done the chapter/rest of the problems.  

Have fun.  Its an excellent book which can be a better teacher than any other professor.
Morin was used as the text for my second-year undergrad course in Classical Mechanics after having used Knight to cover a little bit of everything in first year.

Our professor warned us that the problems in the book were quite challenging, especially the three and four star problems. She advised us that the average problem set question was equivalent to a two star problem and that we could expect to spend a couple of hours on such a problem and that the midterm and exam would be mostly one star problems with a two star problem which we had either seen before or would be similar to one we had seen before.
Why do you study this book? Was it assigned?

Morin is badly misnamed and should not be used for introductory courses at all. I don't know your background, but if you don't have the right level, this book can quickly quench your love for mechanics or even physics.

If you are forced to use it as a first book and see no way to a solution I'd just peek at the answer a.s.a.p. 
Getting my life together 
Graduate school applications. Yuck. I hate writing about myself. Not to mention, the deadline is coming up for a few schools, including my top choices, and not a single letter writer has turned in a recommendation for me. I really hate having to remind them. Not to mention spending over $1,000 on my applications (app fees, gre fees, etc.)
writing lab reports and preparing for the next experiment. also looking in which department i want to write by bachelor thesis.

the 2 experiments last week were really relaxed. the supervisor for the first was one of the most relaxed professors we have and we measured some properties of some magents using a vibrating sample magentometer.

the other one was supervised by a 3rd year phd student, who was really awesome too. let us in at 9am wearing a sweater that looked comfy as fuck and drinking from his coffee cup. in that one we measured the transmissivity and reflictivity of some Optical filters.

this week we will work on the nuclear reactor we have at our uni, im really exicted for that.

and im probably going to write my thesis in the nuclear and particle physics department if nothing goes wrong.
In the paper I'm working on we decided to change one of the variables to be dimensionless, so I'm going through my graphs and dividing all the values by a constant.

I'm studying multiferroics, high temperature superconductors and charge density waves.

A startup in what? You should plan to work for someone else until you have an idea that's good enough to start a company over, and even then you should plan to develop it without setting out on your own for a while. 

A PhD is cool but I doubt another 5-7 years of school will help if you want to start a company.
The only direct path to having a successful startup is to be lucky, wealthy, or prestigious. Hard work and research acumen are always good things to have, but they won't necessarily help as much as you might think. Having a successful startup is more about being good at business and salesmenship, and less about being good at solving difficult problems.

Having a PhD can help with the prestige thing. If you are  "Dr. Mr__Christian_Grey", then people are more likely to take you seriously, and it can be easier to get funding. This is doubly true if you get your PhD from a more prestigious institution - if you have a PhD in a technical subject from a place like Stanford or MIT, you can find yourself in situations where potential funders will practically throw money at you. Your education at such a place won't necessarily be *that* much better than your education would be somewhere else, but brand name counts for a lot in certain circles.

As far as simply having the knowledge necessary to successfully apply algorithms to solve problems, a PhD would certainly help a lot, but I don't think it's strictly necessary. It's probably overkill for your goals.

Consider this: if you're a freshmen now, and if you work really hard, then you'll have a PhD 8 years from now. A lot can change in 8 years. You will change a lot as a person, and the economy can change a lot too, such to the point that it might not make as much sense to try to build a startup. Startups are cool these days in part because they're one form of investment that offers a potentially high rate of return. When the interest rate rises, who knows what will happen to funding for startups?

If you want to prepare yourself as much as possible for applying machine learning algorithms, then the best thing that you can do is to take math classes. A lack of the proper math is what holds back most CS undergrads from being able to understand and use machine learning techniques. The math that you'll need, in particular, is analysis (i.e. calculus, also multivariable), linear algebra, probability and statistics, and optimization theory. You shouldn't necessarily take courses on all of these things in the math department, though; if the engineering or computer science departments offer equivalent courses, then you might take those instead, since they tend to be more application-based.
You should go to business school if you want to start your own company. 

That will help you a lot more than a PhD in physics (especially in the field of AI which has very little to do with physics).
One of the worst websites I have ever seen. Mandatory advertisement viewing before it shows you content, and the article in question takes up the left THIRD of the page, with the rest taken up by other links. Please provide a better source.

my advice would be read more textbooks, less popsci.
I'm gonna be a little blunt here. You're a smart kid, but you're not Feynman. I was going through your profile history and you can be quite up your own ass on certain subs. I'm telling you this cause you need a little humility. If you are getting 100% in every exam in physics in high school then you can say you are learning nothing. To be 16 and jump to quantum reads like something from /r/iamverysmart ... Quantum isn't just philosophy. I hope you are doing the maths too cause its quite difficult.

As for further learning, try some of the physics books available. Such as Feynman lectures, quite a good starting point before college if you are as advanced as you say.

If you are interested in some healthcare related to physics you can read up on medical physics which is fascinating. I have a bachelor's in this field. Plenty of starting material out there and isn't taught in high school.
Do you want help writing a book? Or do you want to study physics further?

If the latter I'm afraid you have to put up with high school for now, get good grades and keep your interests up by reading around the subject. Then when you get to Uni/College you will learn loads more.
1.  Get to the planetarium often

2.  Get to the museums more often

6.  Go to a general lecture or three

7.  Keep looking up
An American would be able to help much more here but, if you were in Britain, I'd recommend joining the [Institute of Physics](http://www.iop.org/). They have there fingers in a whole load of outreach events, send a monthly magazine that is understandable at the undergraduate level (which is where you seem to be aiming), and have a whole host of careers advice. Student membership is cheap too.

However, as a student in America maybe look into the [American Institute of Physics](https://www.aip.org/) instead? I believe they do similar things, though an American based physicist may be able to confirm whether this would be worthwhile.

These organisations are aimed at professional physicists though an ambitious student such as yourself may get something out of them - the British organisation certainly encourages membership from physics students aged 16+. At the very least, it'd be something to write about on a college application!


I dropped out of high school at 15. I was a bad student, although I was intelligent, and wasn't learning anything. I do agree that (for some people) high school doesn't really teach you anything, although I do think that study habits and social interactions are some of the more valuable things you learn in high school, even more so than the actual information taught in classes. 

I always thought of myself as extremely intelligent, and I felt much like you do at your age. But please realize that, even if you are the top 5% in your high school, unless your high school is super special, the top 5% might only be the top 50% at your university. And, with a degree like Physics, the top 5% at your high school might not even be as intelligent as the top 75% in your intermediate physics classes.

Yes, I thought I was very intelligent. Until I was surrounded by people who were actually very intelligent. This is why you are getting some hostile responses, you haven't gone through this yet (even if you think you have) and are getting feedback from people who once considered themselves the smartest in the room, and now find themselves to be extremely average in a room full of Physics folks. And even people that I believe to be extremely intelligent don't feel very smart, because they work with folks more intelligent than themselves. 

I quickly realized that being the smartest person in the room said more about who I was choosing to surround myself with than how intelligent I actually was. 

---------------------------

Okay, anyway, now that I got that out of the way...

Best thing for you to do RIGHT NOW is to watch physics lectures online. MIT has their entire Physics 1 (I think its titled 801, actually) course on youtube. They have coursework that goes along with the video, so you can essentially take physics classes on your own.

I know you're interested in Quantum, but you're putting the cart before the horse. There's a very good reason why you don't learn ANY quantum mechanics your first year, and even if you feel prepared to dive in, understand that you aren't ready. 

Basically, you can't understand quantum mechanics by just reading what it is anymore than you can understand how great of an artist Van Gogh was without having any knowledge of brush strokes. Without knowing the math that goes into Quantum, you're essentially saying "Starry Night is a pretty painting" without understanding WHY its special. 

If you are serious about Physics (and, really, because of your interest and your talent at physics, you should consider it for your major) you need to start looking into what it will take to get your undergraduate degree. You can find some 4 year plans for physics students that will give you an example layout, and from there you can chart a course for learning physics.

[Here's a sample from Stanford.](https://physics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Revised%204%20year%20plans_2016_one%20page.pdf) You need to look up what the course numbers are, but it'll give you a good idea.

You can start working your way through courses, but follow the path. Jumping into Quantum before you learn everything leading up to it is a good way to end up misinformed or discouraged. 

Here's what I suggest:

Watch Physics 1 (intro to classical mechanics) and Calculus 1 lectures simultaneously. Calculus 1 should have initial priority over Physics 1. Physics 2 (intro to electromagnetism) and Calculus 2 should be taken simultaneously, or you should at least finish Calculus 2 before Physics 2. Then you move on to Physics 3 (modern physics) and Calculus 3. 

Modern Physics is where you'll get your first introduction to Quantum Mechanics, and there's a good reason for that. Physics 1 and 2 are stepping stones to Quantum, by providing the necessary problem solving techniques and teaching you to think like a physicist. 

See, Modern Physics (physics 3) introduces you to Schrodinger's equation. This is the bread and butter of Quantum Mechanics. If you don't know what the equation means, then you don't understand quantum mechanics. 

Physics is like a staircase. You're currently on the ground floor. The second floor is quantum mechanics. You cannot get to the second floor without taking the necessary steps, without that initial foundation. Calculus is the foundation, and intro physics classes are the guardrail that helps you make your way up.

Good luck to you.
Like /u/gautampk said, you're probably going to have to just put up with high school for the next couple years--but don't worry, because it sounds like you're already filling your free time with things you enjoy learning.

If you're interested in learning to write better, reading is key. Reading scientific articles and books are good for educating yourself on the field, but not necessarily for pushing you to write better. I'd suggest picking up some fiction work--easy, fun, and interesting reads. Seeing different ways to express the same thought creates a larger toolbox for you to pull from when writing. 

Like you said, the other side of this is practice! Don't be afraid of failing. Writing how you speak is a great way to start. 
Okay, I know exactly where you're coming from. Let me give you some advice.

Be humble. Keep reading. Don't write a book. Go to university.

If you have any interesting ideas, write them down and save them for later. The odds that it's a new or useful idea are very low for someone of your level. 
Agreeing with others here. I highly doubt you've done *any* mathematics work in Quantum or Astro, and you've simply read pop science books about the more metaphysical elements.

If you have done math work, then the following question should be fairly simple and straightforward for you:

Can you apply the Hamiltonian operator to a wave function to find the kinetic energy of an orbital?

If you don't know half the words in that sentence, don't be discouraged. But, that is basic entry level quantum mechanics. Is it *heavy* math, we're talking partial differential equations here, much higher than what I imagine you've seen before in your studies.

If you want to pick up an *actual* textbook, try *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics* by Griffiths, and see how much you can get through.
Talk to professors at nearby universities and see if they need any help in their labs. I've seen high-schoolers volunteer to do real research in physics labs before.

I'm curious - what are you writing your book about? 
Honestly there is so much out there. There are a lot of great youtube channels that present a lot of material in really cool ways. I am by no means saying to only use them to learn, but rather use them to find out what really interests you. Your lucky to be born in an age were almost anything you wanted to know is google search away. Even if the topic doesn't interest you they are still great. 
Some are these are math channels, and other topics, but they are fantastic:

of course this is just a list of the channels i could remember off the top of my head. Also for communities, in my experience you only really need to find one person or a few people that share your passion. From there you can just share you interests and in doing so you keep your passion alive. You have a long road ahead of you, try not to travel alone.

When I was in high school I was blown away by Pascal's triangle and the golden spiral. I consumed as much mathematics as I could and learned as much as my teachers, books, and free time would allow me. When I got to university I quickly realized I didn't excel in labs and so I knew theory was for me. I realized I had fallen in love, with no turning back, when I first derived the Einstein field equation of general relativity. Now, as a research scientist, I marvel at my privilege in being able to attempt at understanding how nature work. I'm even more grateful that I am paid to do this because in all honesty I'd probably do it for no money as well. (But don't tell the funding agency!)
I started at university taking a bunch of science courses and thought that physics was the most interesting, so I decided to major in that. I did an undergraduate thesis project in general relativity and then took a research job in an ultrasound lab doing theory and simulations. Then I went back to school for my master's and Ph.D., working on experimental biophysics. During that time I also wrote and published a few papers on the side, one of which got me onto international news. I finished my Ph.D. in summer 2015 and am now a postdoc.
I'm about to study astrophysics! I love it and can't wait!
I always enjoyed science lessons at school, but my favourite was definitely maths. At A level (the courses taken in the UK when you're 16-18) I did Maths, Physics and Chemistry and that's when I started to see that my favourite parts of physics had lots of maths and my favourite parts of maths were the mechanics courses, as well as calculus and algebra that are key in higher level physics. (I also learnt that I don't like chemistry). I'm now in my first year of a physics degree, and hope to make a career out of it!
I got my first preprint on the arXiv today :)
Got into BA of physics in year of 2015., quit due to family reasons. 

I have been an avid theoretical physics reader since early 2015., also I have given private lessons in physics on secondary school level. 

I'm not sure if I will come back to physics or keep it as a hobby, but I read this sub every day and I talk about understanding the world through eyes of physics with non science-ey people. 
I'm on the edge of failing my second physics course. I think I'll drop out of uni or switch to computer science.
I started my interest when I was pretty young, my dad and his brother both studied physics in college and liked to talk about it. I read through some of their old textbooks and decided that I loved solving these kinds of problems. 
I'm finishing up my senior year of undergrad now as a physics major, and it's looking like my grades haven't been good enough to go to grad school. I really hope that I can find a way to stay in the field, it's all that I can imagine doing.
After highschool I went to college to study philosophy. I ended up getting very depressed. I dropped out and lived nowhere for a while, crashing on couches etc. Eventually I got a job at a bank. One day as I was scrolling through the news at work I saw something about the Higgs boson. I fell in love with learning everything I could in regards to the subject... the rest is history. now I am at university studying Physics. I am part of a HEP research group. I love my life.. for the first time in a long time I am happy. 
Was working as machinist and always was fascinated by science. Sir Isaac Newton didn't know sparked curiosity.  Tried in simple ways understand and explain how gravity works. Gauge blocks  precision tools helped me to find out about weak force. Then deducted gravity must be by product of molecular attraction. Not always is so and this bothers me.  Now trying to learn more about this not always interesting but unknown part. Working on it.
My physics journey is still begining. I started on the opposite end of the "subject line"  I studied humanities and art and even though I will always think of art as one of my passions the thrill of understanding nature and the universe that surrounds us couldn't be compared. That thrill came to me one day when I read about space and how vast it is and tiny we are, that just opened up my mind to want to know more, to want to understand all of it.

I've looked for information online, that gave me access to more than a dozen text books and notes and I'm more than convinced that this is what I want. Studying on my own I've managed to build a nice understanding on the basics and on the math although I still need some help.

I'm currently studying a "FP" (Formación Profesional I don't know how you'd call that in English, sorry) to be a machinist, after I'm done with those studies I'll apply to University and start the real journey in physics!  :)
I lurk this sub sometimes but haven't posted before. I think I followed a weird path to get here and reminiscing is fun. Dunno if anyone wants to read a long, rambling post, but fuck it.

I loved math and science as a kid, but I hated the school system so much that I lost it pretty early. I was never the kid that won science fairs and watched Bill Nye and stuff. I wanted to write novels or comics or something. (My dad and I would have long talks sometimes, about time travel and antimatter and string theory and stuff, but I never really connected any of this to what I was doing at school.)

Eventually, I hated public school so much (except chemistry class, that was kinda cool) that I talked my parents into letting me finish high school through a homeschooling system. A switch basically flipped and I realized, "Oh shit, I love math, I just hate high school." At the time, I was taking physics, and it was the first time I had taken a science class where you could derive everything with math instead of just being told to memorize random facts. There were nights I couldn't sleep 'cause I was thinking about the problems on my homework, or going through the books on physics in my dad's study. A book of Hubble pictures actually moved me to tears and reading about general relativity for the first time made my heart all fluttery.

I was taking non-advanced classes at the time, since I had thought I was going into humanities, but I taught myself enough extra physics to take the AP test even though I wasn't in the class and didn't know calculus, then taught myself trig and pre-calc so I could jump right into calc.

I didn't really feel like a Science Person, since I didn't grow up liking it and all the Science People I knew were guys who knew things about technology and talked about geek stuff and I was this girly girl who'd never seen Star Wars and barely understood my laptop, but I was about to start college and needed to pick a major, so I figured I'd just go with physics and see what happened.

Anyway it worked out pretty well, I've done like three summer research experiences and been doing research at my school for two years, I loved the shit out of my classes (quantum was the best!), found a subfield I really like, and now I'm applying to PhD programs. Still feel a bit out of place in physics sometimes, but I'm gonna see how far I can take this.
I was on a similar boat in regards to what inspired me to pursue a b.s. in physics. I discovered that as much as I like the subject, it's not for me. Too much of an investment (money and time).

I ended up going into the software industry (cali) as a QA Engineer after graduation.

I'm almost done with student loans and get to enjoy vacations
I started as an electrical engineer as a freshman, but after taking the first two physics classes I wanted to see if electrical was the best fit for me. I switched to physics and found that I love quantum and solid state the most. Now applying to condensed matter physics programs and a few for materials engineering.
I read a book called "Quantum" when I was 10. It was a popular science book on quantum mechanics and I quite liked it. I had always loved science for a long as I can remember, but after that I knew physics was my favorite. I read more popsci books until I was 15 and I realized if I wanted to learn physics properly I would need to learn calculus so I taught myself calculus with primarily Stewart, but I also read an old book Calculus Made Easy that used infinitessimals instead of limits. Now I am using Taylor's classical mechanics book and am also doing physics research at local uni lab.
Interest since little kid --> CERN master class and AP Physics I and II in high school --> majored in undergrad --> changed to more ECE in grad
I was an engineering major but did not meet the GPA requirement in my junior year. After trying a few things for a semester I switched to physics since that was closest to engineering and was intellectually stimulating. Ended up going to graduate school for a masters to show I can do the work... my undergrad GPA was pretty low. If work will pay for it, and I can find a school that will allow it, I'd like to go back for a PhD.

This might not go over well with the rest of the community, but I personally believe that the introductory physics course in calculus based classical mechanics that physics undergraduates are required to take is in a sense the most difficult course that they will probably ever take. I attribute this to precisely the dilemma that you are experiencing.

Physics suddenly becomes easier when you learn this logical thoroughness. In fact, all mathematics/STEM does. In STEM circles this is called *mathematical maturity*.

So, your difficultly in this class is absolutely normal. The mathematical maturity will come. If you are talented, it will come quickly with sufficient effort. If you are not, it will take more practice, but you will get it. Just keep at it, and don't cut corners. If you are unsure of a physical principle, read a derivation, then try to derive it for yourself later. Above all else, make sure that you learn conceptually. Do not fall into the trap of thinking that memorization can help you. It will never. Keep these ideas in mind, and remember that if the physics is hard, that's ok - it's supposed to be!
More of a small tip than an over-arching plan for success, but here's where I started noticing the change: Focus on units more when doing calculations. Understand the relationships between units and the formulas. Transform equations into other forms for curiosity. Proper treatment and consideration of the units can help you gain insights into problems where you might otherwise be stuck. Once you start seeing these relationships, a lot of other things will click more easily.
My recommendation is to trust the maths and the algebra. You will develop intuition as you do more and more of the number crunching and eventually develop your own personal picture of the world.

It's something that comes more easily to some than others, but you will eventually develop it. For now you don't *need* the intuition, you need to do the maths and problems. If you want (and this is what I did) you can read some Pop Sci books and things as you go along. I recommend the two books by Cox & Forshaw and the two by Orzel -- each one wrote a Relativity book and a QM book. They're pitched to high school leavers well, and they include enough of the maths along with a mostly heuristic picture that really lets you develop and intuition.
As an engineering student, Physics to me is a way of looking at the world through relationships and expressing those relationships mathematically to create a path from the information you're given to the unknowns you are trying to find. You need to know calculus very well. It's a critical tool. Linear algebra is also important for solving systems of equations. Know the math and love the math because when math becomes second nature then you can actually focus physics. 


Very interesting question and with good question one have good start. Also It does help if one try to compare  something new or unknown to already known. Either way
Great scientists before us helped us to make that sense.  Also helps to learn and check how did they get those results.  Fascinating as it is intuition comes with experience.
 > ...everything clicks into place and you can logically think through problems without having to look at the solutions and stuff.

That's on a case by case basis, at best.
The problem that many bright students have with introductory physics is that it is completely different from every other class in school. Memorizing is no longer an advantage, but sometimes a disadvantage. This is because not every problem can be solved the same way. Sometimes similar problems can be solved in more than one way, but the easiest ways are not always the same. Understanding the overview is the concept that needs to be focused on. Each concept introduced is a piece of the puzzle and all the pieces need to fit together.

So much for the overview. 

The key is to try to understand the problems before you look up the answers. Understand what is being asked and why this is an interesting problem. As the problems get more difficult try to understand what has made the problem more difficult. In the end, you will realize that there are many ways to come to the correct answer, but some ways are easier than others. What you are learning is not a list of equations, but how to solve the problems with the available information. Playing with these ideas in your head and on paper before you can actually solve the problems was the key to my learning physics. And, playing with these ideas should be fun so you keep wanting to solve them. If you just look up the answers you will know the answer for that problem but you won't learn how to solve problems.
Practice. Physics is basically just a bunch of hard math problems with handy equations on hand. Do it enough and I assure you that you'll get better at it.
Dang, there has to be at least 12

I mean, impressive I *guess*, though I'm pretty sure I've seen dudes eat more at Golden Corral. 
Though to be honest such a black hole would have an event horizon radius of about 400 AU (1 AU is the mean distance between the Sun and Earth) which is *reasonably* big as far as black holes are concerned.
How was this made?
Damn that black hole must be bright af
Which super massive black hole? Because there are much larger and much smaller superman's I've black holes than this.
So...more than 7?
Yeah there is no way I will ever be able to comprehend that.

Weak human mind.
I wish I could see a blackhole like that.
What is the ratio in numbers? 
In mass*
So a lot?
No black hole contains a star, let alone our sun.

But black holes can be described by their mass equivalence to Sol.

The gif is cool, but it glosses over the fact that matter and energy are significantly reorganized when incorporated into a black hole.

This has got to be false.
Depending on the size of your university's physics program and your connections, you could get part time positions on campus as soon as your second semester. 

Academia is all about making connections, so get to know your professors and TA's. They can help you secure positions, and letters of recommendation from professors are crucial for grad school entry. If any of your professors are experimentalists, you might be able to get a lab position with them. Theoretical positions require much more math, and most students won't be prepared for that until their third or fourth year.

If your university offers tutoring, you can become a physics tutor after you've taken a few courses and received faculty recommendation.

Additionally, if you're American, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has programs all around the country called Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). Most students in REU's are going into their third or fourth year.
it's never too early for that
As early as 2nd year. My prof told me that the most enthusiastic students willing to do small tasks can get part-time jobs very soon. 
If you're interested in research, I've even seen incoming freshmen have (relatively simple) summer projects to work on in labs doing research. A lot of what you actually "do" as a physicist you learn on the fly, so it's fine to start asking early even if you aren't sure if you have the qualifications yet - many faculty will be willing to work with you wherever you are.

Formal internships and research programs outside your department (such as REUs) may have stricter requirements, but it's still a good idea to look.
You can get them the summer after freshman year if you're eager and lucky.
I just put them in my CV that I sent in. I did no published work, and nothing that could be considered 'research' at all really, but I just listed all of my projects and things in the 'Experience' section.
Well if you want to work relativistically then you should work in a relativistic theory of gravity.
You're making two critical errors.

First, mixing special relativity and Newtonian gravity is broken. It would be sort of okay if you went to the weak field limit, but you're calculating things involving black holes, which are pretty much the definition of the strong field limit. General Relativity exists to answer this kind of question. In fact, GR teaches that energy (the "high-index" time component of the momentum four-vector) is not even conserved near a Schwarzschild mass. Instead, only the "low-index" time component is conserved.

Second, you're using the kinetic energy of a massive particle and asking questions that involve it traveling at c. You're getting nonsense because special relativity says no massive particle may travel at c, so your question is nonsense. Instead you need to express things in terms of massless particles: what mass is so large that light itself may not escape, not what mass is so large that a massive particle would need to travel at c to escape.

You either need to use Newtonian gravity plus Newtonian energy / Galilean relativity, or General Relativity, not a mix of relativity and Newtonian ideas.
It's a coincidence. Namely, the dimensionful part is fixed by dimensional analysis, while the physical content is in the numerical dimensionless constant in front. By coincidence the "Newtonian" reasoning get the same dimensionless number.
You need to figure out your * and ^ symbols. They're making your post look crazy.

Anyway, naively setting escape velocity to c with Newtonian gravity does get you the correct Schwarzschild radius. If you try to combine this special relativity it won't really work, but Newtonian gravity isn't compatible with special relativity anyway.
For statistical physics I really recommend David Tong's lecture notes. They're well written and humorous. He has other material as well, but afaik no QM at that level. 

http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/statphys.html
Depending on what level of Quantum you are doing I find the MIT Open Courses have good ressources:

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2013/

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013/
You may be interested in the [*Theoretical Minimum*](http://theoreticalminimum.com/) series by Leonard Susskind, which is aimed at people with a technical background but not a lot of time.
For stat mechanics, the book by kerson huang is very good.

For QM, sakurai's book is basically standard literature.
The Landau and Lifshitz series is great.
Griffiths for EM, as well as for QM as already mentioned.
[Chandler's Intro to Statistical Physics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0195042778/ref=dp_olp_all_mbc?ie=UTF8&condition=all) serves well as a first text in that subject. I found it easier to follow than other texts at that level.

UCSD provides an excellent, free [ebook](http://quantummechanics.ucsd.edu/ph130a/130_notes.pdf) for their quantum courses. 
Since I've not seen it mentioned yet I'd like to chip in and recommend Nouredine Zettili Quantum Mechanics: 
http://www.jsu.edu/dept/pes/physics/nzettili/
edit: also yeah, for theory Sakurai ftw. Someone already mentioned him.

It's pretty hands on, has a lot of solved examples and problems without skipping "math in the middle" which really helps when you're restarting something. Does a mix of Dirac notation and integration, depending on the problem. 

As per first comment David Tong was my fav in stat. phys. Although depending on what exactly you want you might want to start with something more basic, as far as I remember he jumps in the distributions quite fast, I think Boltzman is shown on like page two while introducing the concepts. 
Wheeler's *Spacetime Physics* is great for special relativity.
Griffiths is a very accessible text on QM. Worth a look. 
Chandler's Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics (concise and comprehensive). 
Griffith for QM. 

Also as a physical chemist now working in healthcare, I recommend looking into nuclear medicine and newer imaging modalities. 
Definitely saving this thread. A whole lot of good references here.
Morin's problem books in CM and EM are going to be extremely useful. 
For quantum, just go through every problem in Griffiths.  For stat mech, get the qual exam prep book and do all the problems.
Griffiths and Shankar books for quantum. But pay attention to the formulas. Sometimes there are minor differences.  (See Ehrenfest's theorem)
Use Griffiths' QM. If that's too light, try Merzbacher, but that's really a graduate text.

There's no such thing as a good Statistical Mechanics book. Shop around, find one that suits you, try Tong's notes, try some online syllabi/MOOCs or whatever. They're all gonna skimp on the combinatorics/probability/statistics. It's a crummy compromise subject that's never taught with the proper background or depth.
Make sure to go to the bar and get wasted the night before your exam. And don't do any problems or study at all.
Just practice, a lot. As you say, the content itself isn't really all that difficult and all the challenge is in tricky wording. The only way to get through this is to practice until you get used to the way questions are worded.

You say they're multiple choice, which means there will be a real temptation to sneak at the answer before you've done it yourself, but I'd urge you not to do this. You should try it yourself and come up with an answer that *you are happy with*. You should be able to justify it to yourself. Then look at the actual answer, and if they match then great. If they don't find out where you went wrong in your reasoning and apply that knowledge on the next question.
Get all the questions right. 
Ask this question to your teacher.  
I can't say what your test will focus the most on, but I can tell you what you will see more of in the future.

Focus on energy and work. They come up a lot in the future.
Sabotage the rest of your class by replacing the course website with Deepak Choprah's youtube channel. 
Do problems, I would assume that your course would be at the level of Kleppner and Kolenkow of Newtonian Mechanics by AP French, find pdf's of these and do the problems. 
I've never gotten a 100%, but I've gotten many 98/99% exams even on harder classes (never really on senior year courses though). Most of the freshman-junior physics classes really only require you to know one thing and know it well. Typically, you only learn a multitude of stuff in courses like Statistical Mechanics (the junior/senior one, not the freshman one) and undergrad Solid State/Condensed Matter.

Thus, learn the ONE THING you need to know, and know it well. Assuming it is freshman mechanics for non-physics majors, everything is trivial is you know how to solve this one problem: find the motion of an arbitrary shape of constant density with a force vector at an arbitrary angle and place, for both constant and sinusoidally varying forces. It should be very simple. You find the moment of inertia and centre of mass via integrals and just solve the problem based on that. Also of course know that conservation of energy and momentum exists, but that goes in any physics course. The only thing you might need to know on top of the one thing would probably be the parallel axis theorem.

Of course, after you're sure you know all that, *practise*.
I see some guests from other subreddits crusing through the thread.  Welcome!  We're glad to have you.  Just a reminder:  We value *civil* discussion.  Keep it focused on the topic and stay away from ad-hominem attacks.  Thank you.
>... any major holes?

Yes.  Many.  But let's focus on one:  As I read the paper, I think the data show quite clearly that the displacement the authors measure is due to *thermal expansion*, not thrust from their cavity.  Of course I don't have my hands on the apparatus, and so can't say this with 100% certainty, but I am convinced, and think you should be too.

It's all in Figure 7.  I've marked it up [here.](http://i.imgur.com/n6KMlFK.png)  Please look at the calibration pulse, the blue plot between where I've marked "On" and "Off."  That shows you how their balance beam responds to an applied force.  Please take special notice of the quick restoration of the trace when the pulse is turned "Off."  See how it just zips back after the force is removed?  That's good experimenting right there.  They apply a known force and it shows how their apparatus responds.

Now look at the RF pulse which is used to power the EMDrive (it's in gold in the same figure).  The authors focus on the beginning of the RF pulse, but I would like you look at *the end*, where I've marked it "No response to RF-Off."   See how there is *no* quick restoration of the spring?  Yes, the trace starts to fall back down again, but that is too slow to be the spring-system restoring itself.  In fact, it looks exactly like what you get from something that heated up while the RF was on and is now cooling.  It's straight [out of a textbook.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooling_curve)  

Rather than a "physics-breaking new effect," the simple explanation is that the RF equipment heats their equipment and changes the equilibrium position of their balance-beam.  I should say that they try to explain this away in their list of possible errors, but the proof is right there in their own plots.  Almost all of them lack the quick restoration that you see in the calibration pulse.

**TL;DR^(1):**  The authors have built a spring-system to measure the drive's force.  When they engage the drive, they say the spring-system compresses, and maybe you could believe that from the plot.  But when they turn the drive *off*, the spring *should spring back*.  **Their own plots clearly show that it doesn't.**  This evidence is visible in almost every single one of their plots.

**Edit:** While I'm at it, I might as well show how their attempt to explain away my criticism, in actuality, only further proves my point.  They say that the configuration of equipment is arranged on the balance beam so as to make the response slow (forget that whether fast or slow it should be the same for calibration and emdrive).  Then they say that it used to be faster in a previous arrangement, their so-called "split configuration," and offer Figure 12 as proof.  So let's take a look at their [Figure 12.](http://i.imgur.com/1CMQ39Z.png)

See how there are little ripples in each edge of the calibration pulse (marked "Ringing indicates underdamping")?  Those ripples show that their spring system is [*underdamped*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator#/media/File:Step_response_for_two-pole_feedback_amplifier.PNG).  That's good.  You want the system to respond quickly and as and experimenter you trade little ripples for fast response time.  Well now look at the drive pulse, specifically where the RF turns off (marked "No ringing means no spring restoration").  See how there are no ripples?  This is *totally damning* evidence.  You could throw out the whole experiment based on this one graph.  The lack of ringing completely rules out that it is the spring system restoring itself.  In other words, when the EMDrive is *on* it *doesn't* stretch the spring-system.  **Their experiment actually proves that the EMDrive makes zero thrust!**

**TL;DR^(e):**  Figure 12 conclusively shows that whatever is moving when the EMDrive is on is NOT the balance-beam/spring-system designed to measure the thrust.  They are **not** measuring what they think they're measuring.

**Edit^(2):**  Well that blew up.  I've got to step away for a while and don't know when I'll be back.  I'd like to leave with just a few things.  One, **White should publish the data.**  I got a complaint that my argument was "hand-wavy."  If we all had the data, we could share python notebooks and everyone could see the analysis and make *quantitative* arguments.  There's not much data, so I don't see a problem.  It would be to everyone's benefit.  

Second, here's  just a quick list of improvements I would suggest if anyone is going to repeat the experiment.  It would allow the experimenters to directly refute my criticisms.  It's just copied from one of my comments:


>* Capture temperature data in real time.  Put T sensors all over their balance beam and cavity.  Thermocouples are light and cheap.  It wouldn't be hard.  This will allow them to make quantitative statements about the thermal expansion.
>
>* Move away from the "linear thrust bearings" as the fulcrum of their balance beam.  It's a squishy layer of mush that can couple orthogonal motional modes.  
>
>* Lock the RF to the cavity with Pound-Drever-Hall.  Acquire all powers (rejected especially).
>
>* Keep the RF on all the time.  This keeps the heat input into the apparatus much more even than it is now (right now you blast it on, let it cool).  Switch the RF between the cavity and a stub so you can do the null measurement *in place*.  Do the switching at a fast frequency so that you are .... 
>
>* ... pulsing the RF and **use lock-in detection**.  Every sensitive experiment fights 1/f noise.  Put the signal where it's not so noisey.  This is a standard technique and will *greatly* improve signal-to-background ratio, and would allow the use of averaging to improve signal-to-noise.
I'm not happy with the entire paragraph that starts with "Optimal tuning".

And I'm really not happy with this:

> The disadvantage to the split configuration that led to its abandonment was that performing forward and reverse thrust testing required complete disassembly and reassembly of the RF system when switching thrust directions, which precluded the ability to establish a “frozen” RF tuning configuration, and was not compatible with the intention of performing force measurement testing at another location using another force measurement system. Also, as indicated in Sec. II.B, tuning the thruster to generate optimal thrust was very difficult, and breaking configuration when switching from forward to reverse thrust was not practical.

I read that as saying they couldn't keep the electronics on the other half of the arm and successfully switch the direction of the drive - and produce thrust - without "re-tuning".  ( I think I can understand why it might be so hard, Microwave circuits are very geometry sensitive... still makes it impossible to eliminate the one thing that is overwhelming the measurements, the thermal effects. )

So for "successful" forward/reverse tests, the electronics (containing the things that thermally heat up and distort the measurements with the thermal signature) - were always attached to the "drive element", and so when the drive was reversed the electronics were also reversed.

I'd really like to see the reverse run for Figure 12c, along with the details of what the "re-tuning" for the reverse run entailed, and what the results looked like without "re-tuning".

I am happy to see a tiny sentence in there that says in future testing they intend to change the position of the most-thermal elements (the heatsink) in order to try and minimize it's effects... 

Did they post their raw data anywhere?  All of the graphs shown (except for a couple tiny choice segments) are their interpolated lines, and I see bits and pieces here and there that make me think they did something wonky with the interpolation at the very start of all the slopes ... specifically I see dashed error bar lines extend out to the left ... why is that there if the interpolation goes elsewhere?

Edit - did they do any testing with a perfectly symmetrical cylinder with dielectric at both ends?  That would display the thermal effect clearly.  And if the "tuning" still worked, well then you know you're not tuning the microwave cavity, you're tuning the thermal effects :)

Edit2 - I'm also really not happy with Figure 18 - if there was a thermal effect on the null run that generated a torsion force - where is the reverse effect, the return to center, once the power was off and the device starts cooling down?  And why does the thermal effect never max out?  If you heat something up, at some point it comes into thermal equilibrium (energy in equals radiative out).  (Okay maybe with only 80W and in a vacuum the thing is still heating up linearly... but I'd like to see something that shows that this is in fact thermal.)

I wonder if any of the non-metalic parts of the apparatus are accumulating a static charge?
A major hole is that the "hypothesis" they put out in another paper and reference in this one is a mishmash of quantum field theory jargon, taken out of context, and thrown together haphazardly. To someone who hasn't studied quantum field theory, the explanation has the appearance of a real hypothesis, but to anyone who has even taken one semester of qft, it's gibberish. For example, the paper they cite as an explanation starts off with this:

"The current viewpoint of the quantum vacuum, or vacuum state, is that it is an immutable, non-degradable state for all observers and systems with no structure or variation. The concept of the vacuum state is typically intro- duced as a ground state of a harmonic oscillator, so the viewpoint that it is immutable is reasonable. How can the vacuum, being the ground state of a harmonic oscillator, be anything other than “zero” for all observers? What if, however, the vacuum could be posited to be a plenum that can be shown to be degradable, and has the capability to support particle-vacuum or particle-particle interactions that allow lower energy, ground states? It is known from experimental observation that the vacuum can exhibit characteristics that can best be associated with a degraded vacuum in the form of the Casimir force"

If this sentence seems like gibberish, it's because that's exactly what it is. They say the vacuum is "zero" in conventional theories, but what does that even mean? Are they are talking about the vacuum expectation value of a field, the energy density? They might as well have said the vacuum is blue, or Zappos, since this makes just as much sense as what they said.

 Then they claim that there Casimer force is somehow at odds with our current understanding of quantum field theory, despite the fact that it was predicted from a quantum field theory calculation long before it was experimentally seen. 

They also claim there is a lower energy state then the ground state, but if this is the case, why hasn't the vacuum decayed into this state, and why does this decay only happen on the em drive (where nothing new is happening).  The rest of the paper makes even less sense then the first part. 
This has been a very good discussion.  But anyone who's familiar with experiment design and data analysis (not to mention QFT) can plainly see this paper is not evidence of the emdrive working.  It is evidence of poor experimental and data analysis techniques.  The most generous thing one could say is that it's incomplete.  But given the quality and results of this paper, the history of the authors, and the history of the emdrive and all associated "research", I think it's safe to say we can put this to bed and relegate it to the pathological science section along with cold fusion.  I think this would be the consensus among actual physicists and regulars to this sub (which include actual physicists).  What say you /u/CarbonRodofPhysics?  Can we not have anymore submissions on the emdrive in this sub and get back to real physics?
I had hope that they'd finally write a professional document, but they haven't. This "the first error is" garbage if undergrad lab report trash. Several of their plots don't respond properly to turning their device on and off. They aren't measuring a thrust. 
Non-physicist here, but even I have been struck over the years by how little tangible science has been produced by Eagle Works, and Harold White in particular. By now, I assume that a much higher quality, higher power "test article" could have been machined and tested (from my understanding, microwave resonant cavities are usually machined to precision tolerance from solid copper rather than hastily assembled in a living room from what appears to be commercial sheet metal). I realize tight budget constraints exist for this project, but I suspect that is because the smart money has found other uses. I want this to be real as badly as anyone, but I'm finding it difficult to suspend disbelief. So many great posts in this thread btw!
I take apart this paper on a few major points, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmDrive/comments/5dvprz/why_you_shouldnt_be_excited_about_the_new_ew/).

**tl;dr** The authors have serious flaws in their experiment and engage in crackpot justifications for their flawed research.  The emdrive is a classic example of pathological science.

edit: words
No quantitative treatment of systematic errors.
The experiment itself has many issues left unresolved which I outline [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/EmDrive/comments/5epl96/comments_regarding_the_problems_of_eagleworks_em/) as well.
The main question: is it precise enough to be a replicateable experiment? Could it be rerun?
Rather than a hole per say, I think there's also the question of why they decided to publish in that journal. I mean they have a paper that, if its claims are verified, basically says they broke physics, and they decided to publish it in an engineering journal about aeronautics and astronautics. Why would want to do that?

Send your analysis to SGU! They were just discussing this paper on today's episode. None of the hosts believed this paper to be true, buy they were unable to explain how. If you're not familiar with SGU, it's The Skeptics Guide to the Universe and it's an amazing podcast about science and skepticism. Awesome job with this BTW!
conservation of momentum
It would seem that the TM212 mode NASA tested in may not have been the best mode. TE012 seems to generate nice impulse force pulses and has much higher specific force than TM212.

Note the force direction arrows on the images.

What are the authors' motives here? Do they stand to make a lot of money? Are they planning a follow-up paper discussing holes in the peer-review system? I think it would be foolish to dismiss this as 'stupid people doing stupid things'; they have Physics PhDs after all.
At least it is not pay walled. :D
I am a bit skeptical on basically all of section 10. Bells inequality violation is pretty robust, so I am uncomfortable with how comfortable the authors are taking three papers on pilot wave theory as the explanation. I think they should be more conservative in their view. 

Also, I need to review the cited papers more carefully. Maybe they do discuss the Casimir force via pilot wave theory, although I am not sure how you would. 
Why don't we just build a tiny rocket in space to test this already?

Same frustum, same frustum orientation on torsion pendulum, should be same Lorentz force, sort of the same frustum heating.

Yet without the dielectric at the small end, the measured force is much larger and the direction reverses, small to big.

Please explain how Lorentz and thermal heating reverses the force direction and taking out the dielectric increases the measured force magnitude?

To me this is the smoking gun.

BTW Roger Shawyer and I measured the same non dielectric static force generation direction as did NASA, small to big, which really causes problems for almost all the theories.

My peer review goes like this: This thing will still be debated as fluke when we'll be everywhere in the solar system using spaceship with theses drives.
I think physicists are going to deny the technology, tell everyone that it wont work, until elon musk shoots a rocket to pluto.
We would need a biomechanics expert to weigh in on this but I'm pretty sure that the follow through does affect the speed of the ball as you release it. Human movement is rather fluent, so if you flub the follow through, you already start doing things wrong even before you release the ball.
We do the same in archery. The point is that by not following through, you will subconsciously make changes to your motion before the ball even leaves your hand (slowing down). By following through, your motion and its effects remain more easily predictable.
Yes it will electrolyse, no the gases arent dangerous.
For household alternating current, yes, it will electrolyze the water. 

With DC current, you get oxygen coming off one electrode and hydrogen coming off the other, plus some extra gasses from whatever impurities are in the water (chlorine, CO2, etc.) There's definitely an explosion risk from that if you trap them, but venting should be mostly safe.

With AC, your anode and cathode keep swapping places, so they'll be generating both hydrogen and oxygen and you won't have any sensible method of separating them (which probably isn't happening in a water heater anyways.)

The much bigger issue is electrode erosion, which will start dumping whatever is in your "heating element" and leech it into your water. The iron and manganese don't concern me very much, same with copper in very small amounts, but chromium is pretty much universally toxic and really needs to be avoided as much as possible. Commercial heating elements usually have a ceramic coating to prevent these problems.
>  Ignoring the obvious fact that one can get electrocuted easily by this

Probably a lot less easily than you would think. It's not like in the movies where if you step into electrified water, you get electrocuted. Electricity takes the path of least resistance.

I watched a video not that long ago where a guy took an electric cord, cut it and stripped the the two wires at the end and then plugged it in. Then he dipped the two wires into a container of water. After verifying with a multimeter, he stuck his fingers in the water and felt nothing. The electricity was taking a pretty direct path between the two wires, and not diffusing through the whole container. He really didn't feel anything until he stuck a finger between the two wires, and even then it was just uncomfortable.
The gases are not dangerous unless you trap them. Theoretically, the gases produced are hydrogen and oxygen. In practice, you get only hydrogen unless the system is super clean. The oxygen will oxidize into salts and deposit on the electrode rather than bubbling up as a gas. 

The bigger danger is that you are definitely dissolving metals from the electrodes into the water. If you run this for a day or two with a a copper electrode, for example, your water will turn green or blue. That amount of dissolved copper ions are not good to ingest, and can make rivers and lakes toxic to aquatic life if they are just dumped out. The toxicity level varies a lot, depending on what metal used in the electrodes. You should not be drinking or cooking with water that is heated this way. If it is only used for washing, and its not done for too long, then it is less dangerous.
Yes, we use electronics all the time.
It's the 21st century. It's hard not to use electronics. I recently used a raspberry pi for some geophysics research. 
This may be legit, but it seems like a poor demonstration to me, since they changed the resonant frequency of the "ship" but have kept the "wave" frequency constant. No surprise that the ship no longer resonates with the waves.
Ah, yes. Turning the ship upside down makes it more stable. How have we not discovered this before?
Pardon my ignorance, but what's happening here and why is it a good thing? Seems interesting but I don't see it lol. Thanks 
This video is junk.

At some wave periods, the free surface effect helps stabilize a ship. At other wave periods, you're fucked.
This demonstration almost completely misses the point with the effect liquids have on a container. 

As the tank moves from the upright, the liquid or semi liquid in the tank will shift to remain upright. This will cause a shift in the center of gravity away from where the natural center of gravity is for the ship. When the ship rolls back and forth, these changes in the center of gravity can cause the ship to become dangerously close to capsizing.  By creating longitudinal partitions within the tank, you prevent the large shifts in the center of gravity. 

This phenomenon is known throughout the maritime industry as the free surface effect and much thought is given to mitigating the risks. 

There are several factors that need to be considered when evaluation the transverse stability of a ship. First and most important is the center of gravity. This is measured vertically from the keel.  The second is the metacenter, which is also measured from the keel.  The metacenter is defined as the point of intersection between a vertical line through the center of buoyancy of a floating body and a vertical line through the new center of buoyancy when the body is tilted. The difference between the metacenter and center of gravity is known as GM and is vitally important for ship stability. 

The GM of a ship determines the rolling period of the ship as well as whether the ship will be stiff (snap rolling) or tender (long slow rolls). A large distance between the center of gravity and the metacenter (large GM) causes the ship to be stiff, while a small GM causes the ship to be tender. In order for a ship to remain stable, the center of gravity must be below the metacenter. A negative GM (the center of gravity is above the metacenter) will cause the ship to capsize so that the center of gravity is below the metacenter again. When the center of gravity is equal to the metacenter, the ship will roll over until it comes to rest at what is known as the angle of loll. 

The effect of free surface can easily be calculated and is known as a virtual rise in the center of gravity.  It is calculated using several factors including the width of the tank, the density of the cargo, and several constants. This virtual rise will case a decrease in GM, causing the ship to become more tender and possibly bringing the ship near capsizing. 

The demonstration above captures a very particular set of conditions. This is known as synchronous rolling, and can be very dangerous to a ship if the cycle is not broken.  This happens when the rolling period of the ship is the same as the period of the waves. This does not happen very often though. 

There is a decent explanation found [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacentric_height) 

Source: I am an officer aboard a tanker which means I am responsible for loading and discharging the cargo. These are calculations I do every day. 

TL;DR: the demo only accounts for very specific conditions which do not happen often enough to merit a design change. 
I've seen these channels pattern in many gas tank in cars, Same principle where the liquid is stabilized so the fuel pump doesn't suck up air pockets. 

It always impressed me I though I should share.
I'm not tanker captain, scientist or marine ...

If this is the cross section of a ship... isnt the water supposed to be outside of the ships hull?


I dont get what this GIF is teaching or saying to me. 
It looks like phase is the biggest difference between the two configurations. In compartmentalized mode, the roll of the boat is 180 out of phase with the waves. While not an Naval Architect, I guess this would be less likely to capsize. 
And the ship could pump in or pump out however much water is needed for the resonance of the pendulum swing. NEAT!
So...  just get rid of the baffles?
I just remember that old guy in the tanker in the movie Water World, the guy spits at him, then he dies.
From what I have understood in Tanker design is that the more compartments to separate the fluid inside, the less free surface movement which can change the centre of mass too much. This was introduced as Tankers had capsized due to the movement of liquid inside pushing the ship past it's limits when rolling. 

I don't understand why the GIF shows the opposite, is it because the container is not floating?
I'm sure someone has already mentioned it, but when the wave speed matches the frequency of the stabilization chamber, you're in for a very bad time.
Sooooo

Roll the ship over and it will be more stable upside down?
That wasn't a good model of either petroleum or incident waves.

It should be interesting to see how information from the test is used for improvements in design.
I believe this was the same idea with the titanic 
Do you have a specialty or some kind of specific interest?
It depends a lot on what you want to do!
In case you want to work on particle or condensed matter theory, the projects will most likely be limited by the amount of quantum field theory exposure you had. 

I can only speak for the european end of the spectrum but from my experience professors are often happy if you approach them to do some sort of project (especially if you dont expect them to pay you)! It worked out pretty well for me twice.

In case you dont want to go too deep into qft, i know from second hand experience that there is also a lot of really exciting work happening in the realm of quantum chemistry. That will also be able to keep you busy just with more quantum and less fields^^ 
What's your mathematics background? What modules/courses have you taken so far?
Ising model can be a good project; not quite fluid dynamics but can raise the problem of how to simulate a large system without simulating a large amount of particles 
Lattice gas automaton could be a good way to get into fluids.  If that comes too easily you could extend to lattice Boltzmann methods.

The BTW sandpile model could also be a fun one, but you'd have to do more than just simulation in that case since it's pretty simple to implement.
You can't use the photon twice so to speak. Ignore photons, let's consider billiard balls. If you first take its momentum, making it go to rest, you can't take its energy afterwards.
Disclaimer: I don't have direct experience here, I'm just throwing out ideas. I'm sure certain materials would break at a certain pressure. Glass wouldn't be a good bet I wouldn't think because varying composition would result in variation in the tolerance for pressure. But high purity samples of something like graphite might do better. Depending on the setup of the press, You could also use a  compressible "balloon" of nitrogen or even air, and the ideal gas law to relate a known change in volume to an expected pressure, then compare to the measured value. 
I think some form of a load cell would be the most common.

edit:  Or just put a second "calibrated pressure gage" in the hydraulics.
t'Hooft has a list of things to learn with some recommended reading, found [here](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/theorist.html)
Two books I'd recommend for the main goals at hand are Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur (Lancaster & Blundell, Oxford) and A First Course in String Theory (Zwiebach, Cambridge). The first of these is aimed at someone with a ~second year undergraduate in physics (UK), but if you took the time to read a book on QM (Perhaps Griffiths, or Binney & Skinner) then that would broaden your knowledge sufficiently and be useful in understanding the concepts. It's presented in a very friendly way and seems ideal to your needs; clear and rich in content but not afraid to hold your hand a bit. The second is I think adapted from the author's relatively recently introduced undergrad course in string theory at MIT, and is a bit more 'textbooky'. I think again in order to broaden your physics knowledge in preparation I'd read the QFT's first.

If you're after a 'tree', then I'd say:

**Foundations** QM, maybe some stat mech (Landau Lifshitz), some special relativity for familiarity.

**QFT** QFTGA, referenced against Peskin & Schroeder. P&S is I think hardcore but useful for a more rigorous approach.

**String Theory** Zwiebach as mentioned, perhaps another reference text? Zwiebach has short sections at the beginning on relativity, electromag, QM, gravity but they're more revision based I feel.

Above all, good luck, it's a huge task to teach yourself these things effectively without necessarily a physics background. If there's something you don't understand try your best to tease it out or look it up and work through it.
For QFT try McMahon's "Quantum Field Theory Demystified." It's very comprehensive in terms of its derivations. He doesn't leave many steps out so it's very easy to follow if you are inexperienced but have some facility with mathematics. It doesn't contain any QCD or renormalization*, and takes the canonical rather than path integral approach, but it is exceptionally clear. It will give you a good first good look at the gauge group concept and Electro-weak theory you'll get a good idea of what a QFT is.

If you really want to understand QFT in general, then you need a text that treats renormalization and effective field theory, and this is heavy going. If you are up to that challenge then any of the good standard texts on QFT like Srednicki, or Zee etc. will be good enough.

If you have the time, Freddy Cachazo's QFT 1 (not QFT0 although that is certainly interesting) on the Perimeter Institute website [here](http://perimeterinstitute.ca/training/perimeter-scholars-international/lectures/2013/2014-psi-lectures) (select the "Core" tab) is very, very good. If you need some refresher courses their "Front" tab has some lectures on the basic techniques you'll need.

Edit: I mostly learned by googling lecture notes and working through them though, but I had a fairly solid background in QM and Mathematics. 
Maybe it's possible but it will be difficult.  I am not an expert in string theory or QFT so I can't give you advice.  I have a PhD in physics, but of the more traditional quantum mechanics variety. Plus I am 20 years rusty. 

My feeling is: the gulf between the average physicist and a string theorist is as big as the gulf between the average layperson and the work-a-day physicist.
You actually have some pretty good qualifications for this. One way to understand QFT is to work your way through QM, to end on many-particle quantum mechanics. This is for example done well in Sakurai & Napolitano. 

A great ressource is "Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur", which sounds like it is exactly what you need.


I started with griffiths particle physics then moved on to QFT demystified after that you probably have a good background to deal with particle physics but its not enough. My plan is Student friendly QFT next after that hit the Weinberg's as needed.

If you don't like hitting em books real hard then you can follow these steps:

Though I don't know if that will work but looks pretty solid. I will try it out sooner or later.

Edit: Forgot to tell you I actually discourage you to start with QFT for the gifted amateur, you won't know what the hell he is talking about in the beginning unless you have a little background in particle physics which is why I recommend griffiths first especially chapters on dirac equation, feynman diagrams, symmetry and gauge theories being the most important ones. I'm following the method on the video though, looks like it's working, blazing through weinberg's as we speak ;).
My advice in reading is Gravitation by Misner Thorne Wheeler for gravity and Topology, then Griffiths QM and Elementary particles so you get the taste for QFT, then Schwartz QFT, after that peskin and schroeder and Weinberg vol 1 and 2, di francesco CFT with Weinberg volume 3 should be suitable for learning CFT and SCFT and TQFT. After that you could start with Zwiebach followed by Polchinski volume 1 and 2. 
The reference is green schwarz and witten for string  theory, but Becker Becker and schwarz is also very good. 
That's a plan for several years but if you are very interested and work hard enough you will understand enough to satisfy your thirst :)
realistically it is not a non-career field
What's the point? If you're not planning to do research in string theory, why learn string theory above a pop sci level?
It all counts.
Include it on your resume. The way I do it is to include a short blurb about the different presentations I've made, and then list it under a section called Conference Contributions. My format is:

I love the little stirling engines that you can put on your cup of tea to watch them go. If you live in a cold area it might even run just on the heat of your hand. E.g.: http://www.miniinthebox.com/neje-low-temperature-stirling-engine_p2321868.html
If it's a gift for someone you are willing some money on, then I think you can't go wrong with a telescope for anyone interested in science. Non-toy ones ones start from around 150 dollars I believe.
Those nixie tubes are cool. 
Toy gyroscopes are fun.
You can buy Lictenberg figures anywhere from 60 to 200$. 
Assuming their institution doesn't already have it, a Mathematica subscription? 
To a certain extent yes. You will probably get more out of a tier 1 research school over an underfunded new physics program. You'll still do the same problems that Ivey league guys are doing, but you'll get a better experience from a wide variety of research options. 
If you wind up pursuing a career in physics research, it seems that where you get your PhD matters a lot more than where you get your undergraduate degree. If you don't work in physics research, then that's probably not the case.
It depends on what you want to do. If you are interested in the possibility of a research career, you will need to go to graduate school. In that case, your choice of undergraduate institution won't matter as much, as long as you have a way to start doing some research (and get good grades). CU Boulder or another decent state school would be a good choice. Your choice of graduate school will matter a lot more, since it will determine who you work with and what resources you have access to.
All that really matters is finding somewhere where you can succeed and can possibly get in on some research opportunities. Does going to MIT offer certain advantages? Yes. Are those advantages worth choosing them over a different school more fitting to your personal learning style? No.
ASAP Science has a detailed and thought provoking answer, backed up by statistics, to this question.

I attended a shitty college but also had the good fortune of spending some time at a really good college as well.

In terms of classes, there won't be a huge difference. You'll generally be working from the same textbooks and will get a variety of professors; some who are really good, and some who are just there to do research but also have to begrudgingly teach classes.

If you plan on getting involved in research, a more prestigious school will likely have more labs. Bigger, better labs with big telescopes and particle accelerators. That doesn't mean you can't have perfectly good labs at less prestigious schools, it just means you likely won't have as many different types of research to get involved with.

And of course, it's more impressive when you can say you graduated from some place people have heard of.
It matters a little bit, but not in a make-or-break way. If you attended a top institution and had comparable grades, post-graduate opportunities would be a little easier to get.
Short answer: sort of. 
Long answer: yeah I guess so.

TL;DR: more prestigious schools and physics departments have more $$$, connections, resources. The actual education you are receiving is similar. If you can make your way at a public uni and do some awesome research (aka get published), then you likely won't have a problem. But it's easier to do that at more notable unis.


Yes, absolutely it does. Especially for evidence-based and cumulative fields.

The same person with the same intellect will have a markedly different academic, social, and alumni experiences and opportunities at different tiers of university. 

This difference between what you get from an Ivy League diploma and a school which doesn't have an immediately recognized, worldwide, name on your diploma is colloquially referred to as privilege.

That's the macro POV. The micro POV is when your CV goes across HR's desk and one brings to mind "daamn, Carnegie-Mellon" or "Uni of Lincoln-Nebraska has a physics program?" is huge iff you don't have the kind of intellect that CERN hires.

That intellect could be a mechanic and change the world. Kinda like the mechanic who was the mechanic who built the electromechanical computer at the American CERN at 30s&40s Princeton.
If you wish to use Physics to work in a bank, I suggest you go onto some of the bank application pages, and take a look at what universities appear in the drop down list.
No.  In fact, they are largely overpriced.  

PM me for details on how I can provide you a Doctorate in Physics from Caimbrige University, or Oxyford.  
I am currently a freshman at a University. Finals are coming around the corner, and I would like some book recommendations to practice on my skills. I would like to use these book when I am on break so I do not get bored. We are currently learning Oscillations, which in my opinion it is a bit difficult to follow along. I use the MIT OCW website, which is extremely helpful. I also have the 1000 solved physics problems, which I cam currently working through it. My problem-solving skills are moderate, meaning I understand the basic part of the concepts, but I just need an extra push to fully understand it. Also, any good books to read about Black holes and Galaxy formation? (This is what I want to study in) Any recommendations? Thanks.
http://gen.lib.rus.ec/
Can anyone recommend a book about particle physics from a differential geometry/topology viewpoint? Goes into detail about Lie groups when talking about gauge theories, etc.
It would be really cool if anyone knows such a book that touches on the history of the theory as well (kind of like dirichlet's principle by monna, great book)
I am going to teach myself quantum mechanics soon. I have completed calculus with Stewart, and am about to complete Classical Mechanics by Taylor, which includes lagrangian and hamiltonian mechanics. Seeing as I am lacking in knowledge of PDEs, linear algebra, and probability, I figured I would pick up Mary Boa's mathematical methods book and work through those 3 chapters before reading a quantum book, shankar probably. Does this sound like enough for QM or should I be reading seperate books on linear algebra and pdes respectively to gain more depth? 
Good evening everyone,
I'm currently in school for radiologic technology and am just finishing up my first semester of physics. I don't have a science background (my doctorate is in music), but am greatly enjoying the material and seem to be grasping the basics pretty well. For several years, I've been interested in tesla coils and, because of a physics project requirement, I had an excuse to finally build a slayer exciter (not a tesla coil but, nonetheless, the build was a ton of fun). I'm now interested in building actual Tesla coils, but I want to learn as much as possible about the physics behind them before starting. I'm also interested in learning how to handle high amounts of energy safely. I'm wondering if any of you might have some suggestions as to where I, as a beginner, could start. Any insight would be extremely helpful and appreciated!

From what I hear you really have to decide weather you want to work in a job directly relating to Astro/theoretical physics. If you do, you should probably pursue a graduate degree and the job prospects aren't too good unless you're really good. However, if you're okay with doing things not related to physics those are great degrees that show employers you're very smart and good at solving problems, so you have a lot of options open.
Technical Consulting? 

That's what happened to me anyway. (I'm engineering physics tho)
Depends on what you want to do.  I feel like physics is great training for lots of technical fields.  There aren't many problems in physics that are exactly solvable with pen and paper anymore, so you have to know where to make approximations, and that's good training for life. :)

There's more out there than academia. I am a computer programmer in a the space industry. 
Teaching is the safer way to get a job in physics.
Academia mostly. You still have to travel a lot. Source - my theoretical physics prof. 
First it maybe good to define what shockwave exactly are we talking here, then it might be good to define what exactly hypersonic means. For stuff like mach 5, 6, 7.... I can't really see it having any effect.

If you're a meteor, about as big as a grain of sand, going at 60-80 km/s (kilometers per second, about mach 200) you're going to see some funky physics.  If you're going 70kps, just from the kinetic energy you would have somewhere around 6x10^4 joules per gram. Hitting the atmosphere even at high altitudes (there are meteors as high as 120km but the majority of the ones you see from earth are 70-100km in height) where the atmosphere densities are very low they would still be dense enough to vaporize and ionize the surface material of the meteoroid and dissociate and ionize the surrounding atmospheric gas. This is known as ablation. Opik did some calcs. about this way back in 1950's.

There's not really *a lot* known about what *exactly* happens in ablation as modern theories tend to have a bit different approaches, depending on the mass and dimensions of the meteoroid it'll either slow down and stop or move on in, where the atmosphere is a bit denser. At that point you're still moving so fast "air can't get out of the way fast enough" so gets compressed and forms a bow wave in front of the meteoroid. 

The outer layers, many times the meteoroid size, are still plasma and they glow brightly but "it is said" that only about 0.1 to 1 per cent of the energy is dissipated in the visible spectrum [these are very oddball approx. numbers mentioned just about everywhere, try Handbook for visual meteor observers from International Meteor Organization for details]. If only 0.1 to 1% goes on visible light then the majority of the energy mist dissipate as thermal, infrared, uv possibly xrays and so on. 

So the process of ablation now takes a bit different form, where the pressure and radiation are the ones striping materials from the meteor and not the "mechanical" method Opik used. This is slower than the Opik approach because the compressed air in between the meteoroid and the plasma is in a sense shielding the meteoroid body. 

So, in conclusion, far-hypersonic speeds with small masses might have that effect.
Programs that are small, but not *that* small. Often schools with no grad program have a lot of opportunities for undergrads.
Reed is a great undergrad for physics. Griffiths still teaches classes every now and then, and the regular profs are great. 
Look for a school without a physics graduate program. Generally this will mean looking at smaller schools, and they may not have super impressive names (MIT, Cal Tech, etc.), but they will offer you the opportunities you need.
University of Pittsburgh, man
Or how to get a good gauge on it when it seems like all schools have the same general research areas
Depends on what topics you're interested in. UCSC, for instance, has pretty good undergraduate research opportunities in astrophysics.
Does the area of the country / world matter to you?

I tried googling, but I admit that it is hard to find good enough search terms to not just get REUs.
Boston College has guaranteed REU.
[Here you go](https://www.gradschoolshopper.com/gradschool/browseby.jsp?q=7&cid=3), just ctrl+F for electromagnetism
I don't know about a M.S. specifically in E&M. The closest thing would probably be accelerator physics. Lots of magnets, cavities, ion-optical beamline elements, and whatnot.
What sort of job are you looking to prepare for?
There's AMO (atomic/molecular/optical) physics. But basically any area of physics will involve electromagnetism in some way.
How did he, in all of his theories, not mention the "castor wheel" effect? A big part that keeps the wheel pointed forwards is the sweep of the fork pushing the wheel ahead of the steering axis, so that any weight downwards on the steerer will cause the wheel to straighten out. A toy that uses this is the "wave board" or "rip-stick" two wheeled skateboard. Apparently that is why it is hard/impossible to ride a bike in space (with magnetically tethered wheels). 
> Tired of quantum electrodynamics, Brillouin zones, Regge poles? Try this old, unsolved problem in dynamics: How does a bike work?

Is that really an unsolved problem?
Ted talk for the lazy

https://youtu.be/2Y4mbT3ozcA
What about countersteering on a motorcycle? Perhaps the heavier weight of the front wheel brings the gyroscopic effect into greater effect?

If you yank on the left handlebar at any speed above 30kph on a typical motorcycle, and that bad boy is tilting right, every time.
I love this problem and challenge every physics enthusiast with it. Everyone is misinformed about it or unaware of it.
The prospect of a real job terrified me far more than getting a phd.
The idea that blew me away is that the speed of light the same in all reference frames and this universality is so important that our conceptualizations of time and space have to warp. 
I always love this story of how I ended up choosing my college major so here I go! My freshman year I came in undeclared and unsure of what the hell I was going to do with myself so I chose to just go with general engineering as a start. On the first day of school I went to one of my intro engineering class's. I was sooo fucking bored to death and I swear everyone around me seemed idiotic so I realized that I was definitely not doing engineering as a major. Then then that weekend I ended up going to my friends dorm who was a Math major and we all ended up getting extremely wasted off of everclear. Like seriously around like 6 shots of that shit. But once drunk I began talking to my friend about mathematics and somehow the universe. At this extremely drunk moment in time I somehow had a realization that I needed to understand the inner workings of the universe (a very nice feeling  btw). Then literally at 8 am the next morning not even hungover or anything I got up and changed my major to math and physics and completely redid my schedule. I haven't changed since. My love for science has only grown since then and I feel quite happy about the path I am headed on in life. 
The winter of my last year in undergrad, I was taking a GR class. My professor has been heavily involved with the search for gravitational waves at LIGO for a while now. (At this point, some of you might imagine where this story is going.)

Two days before the announcement, our professor told us that he was cancelling class because of the upcoming press conference (at that point, described as an "update on the situation at LIGO"). He went on to mention that our physics department would be streaming the press conference and that he was going to host a colloquium later in the day on this so-called "update," encouraging all of us to come since we might "get something out of it."

Of course, the purpose of the conference was to announce that LIGO had detected what were, beyond any reasonable doubt, thought to be gravitational waves. The entire department cheered like crazy. From the press conference to the colloquium and the celebratory toast, you could tell that every person there was just completely euphoric about the whole thing. I had always wanted to do research anyway, but the events of that day served as a huge inspiration for me to pursue physics.
Visiting and standing on top of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak at MIT. I'd been very interested in fusion and plasma physics for some time before that (this was last year, I was in grade 12), but visiting a fusion reactor in person was just mind blowing.

Tokamaks like Alcator (now shut down due to funding cuts unfortunately) are the result of various fields of cutting edge physics to create something truly remarkable. 

I also remember seeing a huge poster in a hallway with a cross section of the reactor, and each little bit had someone's name linked to it. Hundreds of physicists and engineers, collaborating to make this thing a reality. Boggles the mind.
I've somehow known since primary school - got it first when I was maybe 12-13. Combine that with a brother older than me who was doing his undergrad at the time and an awesome teacher, and not a single question I had (and there were tons) went unanswered, but what annoyed me the most was how I could see they were trying to simplify things for me because at that age, I simply didn't have the necessary math knowledge. For example, we'd be doing a body sliding on an incline and I'd get stuck with the geometry of forces, a typical conversation would be sth like -oh but just take a sine of it... -Huh? What?
I lost interest in high school, at least for the first two years, because the teacher was absolutely horrible. She would write down notes/derivations/formulae on the board, get us to copy it and then "explain", aka just read them out loud. Then I moved schools, chose physics as part of my IB diploma course and my mind was blown again. An amazing teacher, again, tons of hands on practice work (Every week, basically), a glimpse into calculus in physics and everything seemed just to be waiting for me. I started my undergrad and never looked back. Even with the less-than-ideal parts, it is way too awesome to be left alone. 
I did one the summer my first year. My advice would be to apply to over a dozen internships. You might only get one or two offers and they might not be the ones you want most, but it'll be a good place to start, and if you do well at it, you'll have a good reference and probably get an even better one next year.
you're basically asking why we can't swallow our own throats.

you are confusing a black hole's structure (its spacetime curvature) for events it can affect (local matter and energy).

> Why does that space beside the black hole not become part of the black hole like everything else?

that's like asking why a whirlpool in a lake doesn't consume the whole lake. the size of the whirlpool is dependent on its strength. so the reason the black hole doesn't consume literally everything is because it is only so strong, as compared with the local spacetime tension and expansion - i think.
> It says that black holes are just collections of these events that we can not perceive.

No. The black holes are actually there and the objects that fell in are in it. There are coordinate systems of black holes which don't work right at the event horizon (some variables "go to infinity" there), but there are also coordinate systems without those issues. Coordinate systems are arbitrary - the physics is independent of them. The physics doesn't have the issues some coordinate systems have.
When you look at the schwarzshild metric you will see the term '1-rs/r' in the denominator, so the singularity arises (and therefore is the requirement for there to be a black hole) when rs equals r, with r the coordinate distance to the object, and rs the schwarschild radius = 2GM/c^2. 

And why does something stop existing when separate from you from the event horizon, you could say anything that you will never be able to see doesn't exist. 
You gotta to have in mind that a black hole is a collapsed star, thus the inside is made of the former core of a star. Every massive objects create a gravitationnal field, and so a escape velocity is related ( on earth its about 11km/h). The escape velocity of a black hole is so huge that even the light cannot escape from it. This is why there is a horizon, where light is trapped ( too fast to be swallowed by the BH, but not enough to espace its gravitationnal field). So there is no reason the BH should expand or any matter beyond its gravitationnal field should be attracted.
And you talk about "space beside the black hole not become part of the black hole". A BH is a deformation of space time itself, how could this become part of it ? 
Hope i made myself clear :)
it has a higher relative mass than all of its isotopes' mass numbers, but not the actual masses of all the isotopes. Specifically, U238, which is by far the dominant isotope, has an actual mass of 238.05078826, which is a bit above the relative mass. 

U238 having a mass higher than its mass number might be what you're referring to as the mass defect, I'm not familiar with that term.
Yes, by definition. 

For future reference /r/askphysics is a better forum for simple questions. 
I think you can ask in /r/Germany or /r/de too.
studying to do teaching in schools is a completely different thing. you do special courses on the more difficult/modern stuff (that isn't too relevant for schools), like "theoretical physics for teaching candidates". if you wanted to get back into research from that it would be a long way. a friend of mine finished that and found teaching kids wasn't for him so he tried doing something different with math/physics, but he would have had to do a lot of stuff where he had "light-version" of lectures compared to students of proper physics or math.

then for bachelors there's usually no distinction between theoretical or experimental physics. you just choose a different set of courses in 3rd year (6 semester bachelor) that fits your interests best.

master programs are either the same for theoretical or experimental (and again you choose a different set of courses, with a lot more freedom than in a bachelor program) or there's something like "technische physik" (technical emphasis) which might train you better towards working in the industry. a friend of mine did that and his program differed a bit in what was considered mandatory and i think he had to do do an internship at some company.

that said, there may be universities that will have a special  master's program for theoretical physics in the same way i described "physics with technical emphasis" above. i doubt it makes much of a difference though. they'll probably look more for the courses you have taken and if they give you qualification for a job, rather than just checking the name of the program (whether it's just physics, or technical physics or theoretical physics, or whatever you can make up).


again: teaching is completely different and incompatible and will be 1/3 pedagogic training, and very light on modern physics (and more abstract math).

a proper physics  degree will be "downward compatible" but you will have to make up for the missing pedagogical training (including internships at schools, i think several ones, starting out as 'once a week' in the first semesters, then a longer one of 1-2 months, finally a full semester of schools and accompanying seminars, and after acquiring the master's degree a proper candidate teaching position of 1.5 years which you have to pass to become a teacher).

(btw i'm in theoretical physics and did a plain "physics" BSc followed by a "physics" MSc in germany)
I can't comment on most of this, but I do feel like you are way off the mark when it comes to engineering. 

First, of course, having a BS in Physics does NOT make you qualified to be any kind of engineer. Electrical engineering covers some very specific stuff and someone with a physics degree will typically know only the introductory EE knowledge. Maybe you could get a job as an entry level RF EE. You are on point about that.

However, where the real engineering jobs for Physics people lie are in semiconductors. Working in a wafer fab as a process engineer, metrology engineer, etc. involves a lot of physics and there are plenty of these jobs out there. 

I'm an application engineer (kind of a catch all phrase for making stuff work and dealing with customers) and I work in metrology. For most semiconductor (and probably other industrial) measurement methods, you use physics, and physics that will be familiar to someone with a BS in physics.

At my company, we make tools that measure using optics, by shining a large range of light (from UV to IR) at an object and measuring the reflectance. I am literally using applied physics every day as an engineer, and this was my first job after graduating with a BS in physics.

When I go on business trips, I train and work with processing engineers, metrology engineers, and maintenance guys (think fixing multi million dollar tools, not tinkering with air conditioning.) These are ALL jobs that a Physics BS could get into on an entry level, or MS/PhD could do on a higher level.

And, sure enough, I work with BS/MS/PhD Physics people every single day. 

Basically, any wafer or disk fab will have the need for lots of physics people on multiple levels. There are fabs like this all over the world. I even spent two weeks at a wafer fab in Sicily, working with physicists, chemists, and material science guys and gals. 

Most wafer/disk fabs have moved out of the US, but there are still a lot of them around. I've personally worked with fabs in San Jose, San Antonio, and Mountaintop Pennsylvania, and I know of fabs in Portland OR, Los Angeles, San Diego, Idaho, and Utah.
Great post.

Just to build on what you've said, here are some 'less traditional' careers that physics can lead to, from some personal direct and indirect experience:

* Law as you said, specifically IP and Patents
* Business development
* Leading on from that, technology transfer/knowledge management - something that I used to work in
* Health physics (e.g. radiation protection) - what I currently work in
* Project management
* Consulting e.g. on management, or job skills
* Finance
* Market analysis, whether finance or other sector
* Intelligence, whether defence or business
* Marketing/communications, especially for tech/science companies
* Operations, e.g. mathematical analysis to improve efficiency within a business

Physics has a *lot* of transferable skills that some people often don't link together, aside from the 'obvious' ones like problem solving: 

* Time/project management (remember all that lab work that you do, and experiments that you design? Employers dig that stuff)
* Communication, written and verbal from presentations and reports - and if you've had one, Vivas make great examples. Being able to defend a piece of work that you've committed up to multiple years of your life to, in a high pressure situation is very appealing to employers
* Personal skills, tying into the above - despite the awkward scientist cliché
* Teamwork
* Broad range of IT skills
* Ability to research - this sounds bizarre but you'll be surprised in the working world how poor some people are at general research, e.g. finding information on competitive products

Take the above points, with obvious ones like problem solving and you've got a general job description for pretty much any job out there.

In short to echo /u/physbro91, don't think that Physics pigeon holes you into academia or traditional jobs.
I just graduated with a BA (school doesn't offer BS) double major in Physics and Math last May. I applied to dozens of research jobs and defense contractors over the summer and heard nothing back. Despite having a good GPA, some connections and research experience.

This post somewhat confirmed my experience, the job market for me sucked and was nothing like I thought it would be. I'm currently working in education and weighing the options between getting my teaching license and going back to grad school. Not gonna lie, this post kinda made me doubtful that I'd be able to get anywhere.
What's the research job market like in astrophysics?
Just want to say that a graduate degree in biology is not as employable as you seem to suggest. In terms of cash flow yes a lot more grant money is given out but there are also *significantly* more Biology graduate degrees than Physics. 

If you look on /r/Biology /r/Biochemistry you might find very similar situations to what people have had problems with here. 
This post really hits home for me.

I graduated in 2010 with a Bachelor's in physics, and I thought I was set. I was told by parents, advisers, and friends that jobs would be thrown at me left and right, and that I could really go into any field that I felt like. I was confident that I'd be able to get a reasonable paying career in whatever suited my fancy.

Well, six years later and I've found that to not be entirely true. The only jobs I've been able to land are in education, and all of them pay crap.

I'm currently unemployed (for several months now) and I have yet to find a job posting that mentions a bachelors in physics without requiring 5+ years of experience in [insert incredibly specific branch of physics/engineering here], or saying that at least a master's is preferred. 

I definitely feel lied to about the usefulness of an undergraduate degree in physics. It's now 6 years past college and I've just now realized that if I want to do the things that I enjoyed doing in undergrad physics ever again I'm going to have to get a master's degree at least. Sigh.
Thanks for this! Since I am in Germany, I would like to ask as far as you know if this situation is the same in Europe. And my current plane is to do research after my university. How hard is it to get such a job?
When did physics become the foundation of Computer Science?  Pretty sure the mathematical foundations are in logic and discrete mathematics.  I'm not saying that physicists can't transfer their knowledge to CS, but to say that physics is a basis or foundation for CS is wrong.
Thanks for this, on my first year Bsc Physics with Astrophysics thoroughly considering changing that to w/ Nuclear Technology, so this helped.
One of my friends in college was a Nuclear Engineering PhD that was hired directly into finance.  As I understand it, the tools for finding a tiny particle that existed momentarily among a sea of data also helps you find lucrative investments before everyone else (once others find it, it is not as lucrative).
Let me share my story then:
Physics actually builds a mental infrastructure that allows you to be expert in problem solving. Computers provide the tools for it. I am a high energy physics graduate, MSc from a state US university and 2 degrees in software engineering and physics, 4 years each. I did a PhD for a year and i had to leave it in order to find a job (32 years old back then).

I landed a job in algorithmic trading as quantitative analyst, for 2 years. Then I moved into Data Science and Machine Learning and I do this for the last 2 years.

Building models that emulate aspects of the real world, making predictions and facilitate data-driven decision making, can be the closest equivalent to physics mentality you can find in the business world.

Just keep in mind that you still need to keep up with recent developments.

Our species didn't take care of fundamental questions. Less than 1000 people in a planet of 7 billion can do pure theoretical physics. You are not one of them. It is unfortunate but life goes on.
As a freshman undergraduate who loves astronomy/astrophysics, what should my plan be to obtain a career in the field?

This is probably naive, but it is depressing to me that I could get a Physics + CompSci degree and end up going into government/finance/even engineering.

I really want to stay in astro, but I am receiving mixed feelings about availability of jobs. Should I even worry about this now?
This is a great post. You mentioned geophysics as a field in which you're better with geoscience or geophysics as undergraduate. A similar field to this which is much more suited to a pure physics education rather than geology would be petrophysics.

A petrophysicists role revolves around either acquiring or interpreting data from down oil/gas wells; acquired using petrophysical logging tools that are either lowered down the well on wirelines or attached to a drilling assembly and measured while drilling. The physical properties measured can then be used to determine properties such as porosity, permeability, water saturation (hence hydrocarbon saturation), lithology etc.

Petrophysical tools can measure a wide range of properties e.g. **gamma ray counts** (at different energy levels can help determine clay volumes and properties), **bulk density** (the mass density can be inferred from electron density measured from compton scattering in the formation), **neutron porosity** (measuring how  much hydrogen, hence fluids are in the formation using a neutron source and a couple of detectors), **photo-electric factor** (very good for lithology determination), **resistivity readings at various depths of investigation from the borehole** (for use in our water/hydrocarbon saturation equations), **compressional and shear sonic readings** (good for porosity calculations but also to help tie in the petrophysics to the geophysics), **nuclear magnetic resonance** (looks at the hydrogen/fluids in the formation, from the NMR relaxation time we can determine volumes of claybound, irreducible and free fluid as well as calculate permeability), **elemental capture spectroscopy** (inducing gamma rays from various elements in the formation using high energy neutrons, and determining lithology from the relative abundances of the various elements).
I have a bachelor's in engineering physics and am now a graduate student studying biophysics, and I have actually seen a lot of my classmates go into data mining and data science jobs. Employers seem to like the skill set of people who are very familiar with data analysis. But OP is right, physics is a great base, but you can't expect an employer to be amazed at your physics degree. You need to augment it with some more specific classes, whether it be in electronics or computer science. 
European physicist here. Optics is a field almost untouched by other degree courses and with some demand in industry. There are also opportunities to pursue it on an academic level, with most universities I have colleagues at receiving funding from industry which allows them to fund projects. However (as with most Science degrees let's be honest) you need a Masters or more.
This is a bit silly. I took physics as my major in undergrad but I ended up switching out of it in favor of comp sci. The only reason I did the switch was to guarantee myself a job after graduation (which I did).

In no way, shape, or form did my physics background lead to a job.

So for you to say that physics is employable because if you also do comp sci or biology or engineering you can get a job is misleading.
I'm currently doing my bachelor and plan on doing the master right after but my grades are not spectacular, probably average or below average.

Does anyone have any insight on how my chances are getting a job in academia? I imagine that the people who go into academia are the guys who have the rather good grades and a lot of passion so I imagine that will be difficult to compete with them.

I should add that I'm currently unsure about my future career and want to get more info and knowing that I can cancel one option isn't too bad because then I can focus on what I career path I can/should take instead.
I have a degree in physics, 10 years experience, and unemployed for 2 years now. 
[OP has a thread titled "Thoughts on B.Sc Medical Physics \(Now named Medical and Biological Physics\)?" 11 days ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/5ci573/thoughts_on_bsc_medical_physics_now_named_medical/). 

Take his advice with a grain of salt. Be skeptical of what you read online.

Fact is there are not many jobs that specifically ask for a physics degree. Don't be delusional. Study well, above average grades from a decent university may help getting a entry-level job if you don't have the relevant experience. Get a minor in engineering if you can handle it and really want to play it safe. EE or CS has the most demand. It's not pretty, people from my batch mostly become teachers or do a master in engineering. 
 Currently a math major doing a minor in cs, is it still possible for me to get into medical physics? I've always loved physics but I decided to pursue math because it can be applied to a ton of areas of study.
Well I'm currently in my first semester of studying physics at the Technical University of Munich and at the last two semesters you have to choose one of the following four subjects to recess into:

*Biophysics
*Applied and engineering physics
*Condensed matter physics
*Nuclear, particle and astrophysics

Now I actually decided on studying physics because of my passion for it, I love to understand how everything around me works, how the universe works
But I don't want to work in any research related fields tbh
I was thinking about applied and engineering physics so that I could work in engineering fields with the knowledge of a physicist
But your post kinda discouraged me now especially that you seem to be talking from experience
The TUM ahai happens to be number 7 in employability worldwide does that help?
You missed out on a huge, lucrative bridge between physics and law - patent law.

To be a patent attorney you must have a technical background. There's not a ton of people with the backgrounds that people want (EE, Comp. Sci., physics to a lesser degree) who go on to law school.

It's a great option.
Minor quibble from an engineer (by degree and title) here: In the US, most of us aren't licensed and never will be. The only engineers required to be licensed are the ones working on construction/related projects (power distribution, O&G I think, etc.). A PE won't be required to work at companies like Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Ford, Raytheon, Intel, National Instruments, and on down the line.

That said, there is a definite knowledge gap between a physics undergrad and any specialized engineering undergrad. My guess is the breadth of knowledge from a physics BS would probably put you somewhere between a sophomore and junior level, maybe 65-75% of the important stuff. Obviously that's going to vary among programs and specializations. Mech, aero, and electrical all make sense as possible paths (and are incredibly broad fields), depending on the focus of the physics undergrad and what you do to fill the knowledge gap.

Point being: while a physics BS likely won't get you an engineering job at a big company, it *could* get you an engineering job at a small company if you've pursued some engineering electives or extracurriculars to fill the gap, and you should have no problem getting on with an engineering master's if that's the route you decide you want to go. It's almost definitely going to take more work than just walking out with a physics BS and walking into a job, but engineering is definitely a viable path with a little more work (though, like you said, if someone wants to do engineering they should simply start with engineering if possible).
Hi I hope that you will see this. I am currently studying Engineering Physics. The degree is ABET accredited and I want to specialize in applied optics and then maybe get a masters in applied physics. Would this be good for a (high paying) job in industry, like lockheed or nasa or the like? Are Applied Physics majors typically considered good? Or would it be better to get a masters in say electrical engineering or computer science?
I don't really know about the US, but I can tell you my impression I got here in Europe.

If you study Physics to later do Physics, it's like OP said. You gonna have a bad time. Research positions are very rare and you're basically unable to get one without having connections and befriending your profs.

However Physicists are really popular in finance and management consulting, as I said in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/5ehvat/is_physics_employable_short_answer_yes_long/dadohfx/) comment. This seems to be due to the fact, that we are exposed to hard to solve problems almost all the time. Studying physics builds a high frustration tolerance and got problem solving skills. Also we're good with numbers, and numbers fortunately don't care if they represent the speed of light or money.

Furthermore, a BS in Physics is pretty worthless, you might aswell do liberal arts (Slight exaggeration..). If you want to get a job, get a masters degree or even better, a PhD. With one of these you're almost guaranteed a well paying position.
Can't CTRL+F on my phone but DATA SCIENCE jobs take physicists as much as they can get them.  Bunch of physicists at our meetups. Those jobs pay well, too.  
  
The coding isn't that hard and you learn it from colleagues and online courses, but the sheer fact that you'd understand basic stats and math and are a problem solver make you wanted in this sector, at least from what I see.
I am double majoring with my first in computer engineering and second in physics and I'm super excited to see where it takes me. 
What should I major in if I want to be the next Billy Nye? Kappa
> You want to teach physics in highschool? Well..there you go, make sure you load up on **bird courses** and get your average right to get into teachers college.

What are bird courses?
Thank you for the well written post! I've been agreeing with a lot of your comments as an undergrad at the moment, physics is not something that can go into 'any' field by itself.  

Do you have any advice for someone like me to go into computer science? I'm from the UK so it's only possible to study one subject -  Physics unfortunately haha and the idea of going through another 3 years sounds not so ideal. Ultimately, I'm looking to maybe one day join game development as the field to go in. 

And what about Astro-Physics? I swear all the news I read about Musk, NASA, and even Boeing now, tells me that your average Astro-Physics undergrad is going to be a bit more in demand within the next say, 5-10 years? 

I'm just praying that's the case because I'm in my final year. 
So I have training and experience  as a diesel mechanic.  I am pursuing my undergrad in physics and Im not ruling out masters/phd.
While I'm not yet planning on it, I am doing things that would help should I choose to though.   So. Combine undergrad in physics, mechanic experience, and love of anything space/astronomy. What might that look like?
If you are considering using this thread as advice that is ok, but I firmly believe the most informed decisions can be made through extensive discussion with teachers and advisors at your university. Get involved with research and make friends with professors you like who are clearly knowledgeable and involved in fields you are interested in and talk with them about your future. In addition these people will be most likely to provide you with opportunities that no one else knows about. Most of these relationships started for me with an email, so reach out! It's much harder to do on your own.
Christ, that engineering job availability hurt me. Before I transfered to my new university, my previous advisor actually told me that physics can allow you to take on oretty mich any engineering job, so thats why I actually joined physics. If thats not the case maybe I need to look at getting into a different field.
Thoughts on having having both a bs in nuclear engineering and in physics? The two seem like a fantastic combo to me, it's my current path academically.
I think I can contribute something here, as I work in finance and the OP said he doesn't know much about it.

Basically, almost everybody on my team has a physics background. I also know quite a few people who did physics and now work in similar jobs around the world. The catch is, no one is hiring bachelors, they simply don't have enough knowledge and mathematical knowledge to do the job. A master's is a minimum, PhD preferred, mostly in theoretical stuff with a good computational background to go together (there aren't many experimentalists around). Fortunately the work also feels like the closest you can get to theoretical physics outside academia, so that's pretty satisfying too.

As for the people in this thread complaining about other people saying a BS in physics is just a start: that's exactly what it is. If your plan is to study for 3 years and get a job, forget it. A physics BS will only give you crap dead end jobs, unemployment or a struggle in other fields against people who actually studied those subjects. If 3 years is your limit then just do compsci or whatever and you'll be all the better. But if you're aiming for the upper end of the payscale in areas like finance or machine learning, a physics BS is one of the most solid starts you can get, provided you follow up with more physics. (And before you ask, no, doing straight finance is not better, we hardly ever hire anyone like that.)
Let's say my long term goal was to do work at the ITER reactor. In a high school senior now and was planning on taking something along the lines of  engineering physics, plasma physics, and computer science. What do you think I should take in order to maybe take part in true future of nuclear fusion? Computer science is my backup I suppose.
I'm going into engineering from a physics background. I've been able to get some top notch engineering internships, which have provided me with the experience I need to weasel my way into potential engineering jobs. I met a recruiter from Blue Origin and she fawned over my resume, though I don't feel particularly confident that I am qualified. But, I definitely feel that I have a lot more growth potential and flexibility than a lot of former colleagues who were in ME, but we have vastly different skillsets.

Again, I do not really feel qualified to be an engineer, (for many tasks, I would need a lot of training) which is why I am going to graduate school. Also, I want much deeper knowledge. But if I decided I was going to try for a job right out of college I would probably have made more of an effort to get hands-on experience, and I think I would have been fine.

I want to spend my life working in robotics or developing space instruments, and while I wish I had more project experience in electronics, fabrication, or physics research in general, I love physics and  I could not be much happier with my major choice.
there are a lot of jobs for good candidates with physics degrees, but a physics degree alone doesn't make you a good candidate
One thing I've seen from my own classmates, see in this sub and others like /r/physicsstudents, is a lot of complaining and people switching majors. **Do more than what's "required"**. If you don't want to do more, then you don't want a career [bad enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcJHC9J7l4).

You're going to apply to a ton of a jobs that are going to ignore you, reject you in three months, or email you a "No" that same day. Accept it, move on, apply somewhere else.
I'm sceptical about this. In the UK, universities regularly get to show off 80+% employment within industry 18 months after graduation yet you seem to make out that careers within physics are very difficult to obtain.
Someone remind me to add this to the sidebar
If it's RF, you can find out its frequency and expose it to powerful RF at that frequency in the hope of destroying it. 
One of my professors doesn't like his TWIC chip to work, so he sticks it in the microwave for a couple seconds when he gets a new card.  Painful for sub dermal, but you could stick it in front of a radar antenna, or rig a microwave magnetron to work with the door open.
I'm no expert in this field, but from my understanding there's a few things to keep in mind about this hypothetical situation you've brought up:
1.) microchips require a power supply to operate. So that's going to take up space in your body too and would probably be very identifiable. Not to mention, our technology is not advanced enough to completely integrate circuits into the body without the body trying to reject them.  However I think they are working with semiconductor materials with certain substrates that will one day do this. 
2.) Magnets  can affect circuits via Faradays law: changing magnetic field causes a current through a wire. So that's why magnets close to you're electronic devices can cause issues. So, potentially, if you had an implanted microchip you could cause disarray in the circuits and possibly destroy the microchip with a magnet.    
3.) There's no reason an X Ray  couldn't identify a chip in your body. 
4.) directly interacting with  the chip with electromagnetic radiation is not very probable without the chip having some kind of antenna directly connected to it.  

I wouldn't waste time worrying about this kind of stuff. 
You need to leave a blank line between each for to format it properly (i.e., enter twice), or put an asterisk before each one to make a bullet list.

What sort of physics are *you* interested in?
I would say get down to the basics. How do magnets work? 

And then add something about antimatter and how magnetism and antimatter can be related. 
How about laser-plasma acceleration of particles? Compact ion accelerators are all the rage. 
Not all physics is particle physics.  How about:

-Graphene

-Topological Insulators

-High-Temperature Superconductors

-2D Materials, 2D Heterostructures

-Alternate approaches to computing: Spintronics, Flextronics, Valleytronics, Phononics, Polaritonics, etc.

-THz Quantum Cascade Lasers

-Zeilinger's entanglement experiments

-Single atom/molecule transistors

-Organic Photovoltaics

-Organic LEDs

-Printable electronics

etc.
MS student here. my boss - he's officially my adviser, but in reality, he's just the guy signing my paycheck - suggests that i stay in his lab for my phd. 

i have no other options yet but i also have my doubts - not about the lab (i love these guys) but about the country - language barrier is a bitch and i'm awful with learning languages. i want to explore other options, but i don't know if i should even *tell* him that i'm exploring other options. 

what do i do?

(i work with two other guys and i know two others who can give me rec letters, so i can apply to places without my boss finding out)

-----

is there any research field that connects astrophysics and materials science (particularly metamaterials)? better yet: astrophysics and optomechanics. i'm guessing it'll have something to designing instrumentation. 

or modeling astrophysical phenomenon using transformation optics. that sounds really cool.

suggestions for strong research groups would also be lovely.
How is funding in experimental physics right now? I'm considering going into a PhD program and it seems like trying to find the particular fields I'm interested in + can have a stable career in is pretty important.
Do people normally apply for summer internships or research programs during the first year of their undergrads? Or is it normally something done in the second or third year?
While I'm familiar with concepts of physics, I'm not as well versed in the subject as I'd like to be, especially elementary particles and quantum mechanics. As someone who is planning on attending university later in life, what should I learn now or read that will teach me more than an "amatuer" or "for beginners" book would teach me? 
Hi all, I have a question about my dual degrees and their application to medical physics. 

I'm currently a sophomore and I'm in a dual-degree program for a BA in Physics and a BS in electrical engineering. When I came to college I was certain that I only wanted to do engineering and I just wanted the physics degree to supplement my resume, but now that I've taken a bit of physics classes I REALLY enjoy it. I am now currently doing research in nuclear physics through a national lab. Doing this has opened my eyes to the medical aspects of nuclear physics and particle accelerators and I am now thinking that that is what I want to get into.

I have been planning on going to grad school for a while now, so there's no need to clarify on that. But I'm just concerned about my degree in physics only being a BA (getting a BS is possible but I'm not sure I can afford to take summer classes) and that my engineering degree is electrical. If I were to switch my engineering field (which I really don't want to do, I still find electrical engineering fascinating) it would be a backtrack because I have already missed some of the required classes. So I guess I'm just curious if I'm going to be okay going into grad school or if I should make some changes.

Let me know what you guys think.

Her age would be a nice start.
I've done this.  Some advice:

- Monte Carlo simulations are the bread and butter of derivative pricing.  In addition to what you've probably already seen w.r.t. the Ising Model, learn about some variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo.

- Know Black-Scholes back and forth.

- For trading jobs, know a lot of the specifics about OOP, usually with C++.  Things like: What is the complexity of algorithm X?  How to manipulate various data structures.  Explain basic OOP concepts.

- Machine learning is becoming even more import in this space.  Learn and become a pro with scikit-learn or something similar.  Understand why you are doing things instead of just blindly applying whatever ML technique.

- Since 2008, pricing exotic derivatives have taken a back-seat to jobs in risk management.  Traditionally speaking, jobs in risk are a bit less respected than other roles among people in the finance space.  Still, many risk jobs are becoming available and it may be a good foot in the door.

PM if you have specific questions
r/financialcareers might be a better choice. I'm really interested in knowing this as well.  
Finance is largely about managing risk and a big part of that is modelling risks mathematically. 

Look up Black Scholes and study stochastic calculus which also sort of relates to quantum physics.
You'd be surprised how much physics-like math is involved in finance. The basics of option pricing modelling is just doing path integrals recycling many techniques from QM.
Physicists don't typically become investment bankers because that path requires very little mathematical skills; Long hours and Excel wizardry is what they do, the perfectly crafted CV and graduation from a target school/programme are the typical requirements.

This is not to say that physicists don't work at investment banks, they do, but more traditionally on the trading side of things (as opposed to banking that is), often in a role directly supporting trading as quants or in a control function reviewing the mathematical models. The physicists will almost invariably hold a PhD, for why would you hire someone with a master's in physics if you can get someone with a master's in financial engineering who went to school for and learned exactly about the subject matter?

For a trader in a market making function, so an investment bank, there's probably not that much competitive advantage in having a physics degree, so I'd wager most are from a more directly applicable background. That said it's not uncommon to have former quants as traders on the more exotic side of the business.

This all is different on the buy side, where stats and machine learning and all that is king in a large subset of firms. The university programmes are not as developed to cater to the exact needs there and indeed physicists do find ample opportunities as quant traders, quants and technologists. Again the competition is quite fierce and having a physics degree without extracurriculars is not going to impress anyone. Market yourself as a data scientist and make sure you know the basic tools and then some.

If you want to work in finance, why would you study physics?
Get a masters in financial engineering if you want to price derivatives.
I took this path as well.  To be honest, all the mathematics and 'pricing' models are useless.  There are a lot of social variables that the mathematics cannot understand.  Finance is man made but the math that works with it comes from natural equations without any of the complexities of social awareness and interaction (e.g. Black-Scholes equations are just a weird form of the Heat equation).  Stock prices move up or down based on a huge amount of variables.  The movements are pretty much random (not fully but very close).  How can an equation that's supposed to make a prediction on randomness ever be correct?  

You want to be a banker?  Drop the physics and start schmoozing.  Making deals and selling financial products (on very large scales) is where the money and / or prestige you're looking for is.  
Have a cousin who did a physics undergrad and a finance Master's.

She's worth millions more than me now :/
Sell out. 
Awesome! thank you for sharing!
I just finished the book.  I'm a huge Sean Carroll fan and this book was well worth the time it took to get through.  I will check these out to see how his talk compares.
Yes, actually you sort of define the degree of brokenness of a symmetry by the divergence of the corresponding Noether current J, which should be zero if conserved.

This is what is done for example in anomalies, which is when a classical symmetry is broken by quantum effects. To probe the anomaly, you compute the vacuum expectation value of div J, and many people just call that value "the anomaly".

div J is clearly directly related to the "drift" of the conserved quantity, as you say.
Slightly tangentially, a similar situation occurs in QCD, where we can find an approximate SU(3) X SU(3) symmetry between the u,d,s quarks due to their lightness relative to the c,b,t quarks. If the u,d,s quarks were truly massless there would be an exact SU(3) X SU(3) flavour symmetry.

This approximate symmetry is hypothesized to broken by the QCD condensate down to a (vector) SU(3) group with 8 generators, so we should have 8 massless bosons by Goldstone's Theorem. It turns out that all masses of this meson octet are nonzero, because this is not an exact symmetry, but very light relative to the other mesons. They are called psuedo-Goldstone bosons, and their small masses are related to the very small u,d,s masses and therefore low degree of symmetry breaking. 

The effect is even more pronounced if we just consider the SU(2) x SU(2) symmetry between the u,d quarks. In this case the associated 
psuedo Goldstone bosons, the pions have really small masses relative to almost all the other particles in the SM due to this being a pretty close to exact symmetry. 


Similarly, in the Higgs Mechanism the masses of all known elementary particles to an extent governed by the 'magnitude' of the Higgs vacuum expectation value, which can be interpreted as the degree of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The caveat here is that the Yukawa couplings of each particle to the Higgs field also affects each mass, and these are, as far as we can tell, arbitrary. 

Unfortunately I am unsure of an exact relation between the degree of symmetry violation and the conservation of the associated quantity.
Simple version:

You can write any matrix as a sum of a part proportional to the identity matrix, an antisymmetric part, and a traceless symmetric part. As you rotate in 3d space, these three parts transform independently of one another.

If your matrix has non-zero trace, that means you include some isotropic effect in addition to your anisotropic term. If you have learned basic solid-state NMR, you decomposed the chemical shift matrix into an isotropic shift and a traceless symmetric shift anisotropy, for example.

Since your order parameter should be zero in the isotropic phase by definition, you remove the isotropic component by forcing the matrix to be traceless.


Group theory version: (if you have not taken a lecture on group theory, do it)

An order parameter is associated to the symmetry the ordered phase breaks. The symmetry that the liquid crystal breaks with respect to the isotropic liquid is the spatial rotation symmetry SO(3).

Your order parameter should transform under the broken symmetry group in a reasonable fashion, which means that it must transform in an irreducible representation (irrep) of SO(3).

The simplest irrep are the scalars (monopoles in EM, s-orbitals in atoms): Numbers don't change as you rotate them, but we want something that does change.

Next come vectors (dipoles, p-orbitals): They change sign as you rotate by 180 degrees, which is also not what we want.

Then come the traceless symmetric tensors (quadrupoles, d-orbitals): They depend on direction, but rotating by 180 degrees does not change them. This is what you want.

Without rigorous definitions of group size, what's to stop someone from adding up all the numbers in the grid as one group?
Physics of rubber elasticity is a classic text. Should be a good starting point. [Very concise introduction.](http://solidmechanics.org/text/Chapter3_5/Chapter3_5.htm)
Elasticity theory provides you with a set of differential equations that should tell you everything about the movement of the material after deformation and the stresses at each point and so on. To correctly implement boundary conditions is a terrible drag if I remember correctly, but for simple shapes you can cheat a bit. I think you can find the basics in Kittel but I'm not sure, don't have it near me currently.
I would start by learning about the 3 moduluses (moduli? modules?):

* Young's Modulus
* Bulk Modulus
* Shear Modulus
If the rubber is sheets or bands and you only care about its shape, its a minimal surface problem and you could use variational calculus.
You'd be better off asking at physicsgre.com, but from experience the average is a little above 10, (I did 10 myself). 
Also, High Energy Theory is, from what I've heard, very difficult to get into. You'll probably need a PGRE score a bit higher than "middle of the pack"

I am in the middle of my first year of an experimental AMO physics PhD. From my experience, High Energy Theory is a little more competitive, but I hope this can be helpful. I applied to 12 schools, 4 of which are on your list. I had pretty similar credentials as you, and I was accepted to 4 schools. I will tell you that a high PGRE score will help quite a lot with the big-name schools like MIT, Stanford, and Harvard,  but it is not as important for some of the others on your list.  If you end up getting a worse score than you had hoped, you can still get in to some excellent schools with your resume. My PGRE score was under 700, and I was still accepted to my top choice. To answer your question, I would recommend applying to at least 8 or 10 schools. If you can afford the application fees though, more does not hurt. 
When you are applying don't just say "I'm interested in high energy theory..." You want to say I'm interested in Prof.  So-n-so's work (read some of his papers) and maybe how it connects to something you did as an undergrad.  When they read the letter, you want to make it seem like you are choosing them because you are interested in specific research with them that you could get nowhere else, rather than blindly throwing darts and hope some hit.
You don't appear to understand exactly how dense HET is. Applying to 20 schools will not help if half of them are top-10 programs and you describe yourself as middle-of-the-pack. Look for some more realistic options and look for professors who are doing interesting work and have open spots in their groups, rather than the school's name recognition. It wouldn't hurt to email some of these professors, but if I'm being honest you should have done this several months ago.
20 might be overkill. What I'd do is look at the research of each department, email some professors you might like to work with, and from there you could make some cuts. Like if you couldn't really find a professor you could see yourself spending 5-6 years with, don't apply.

Ps - I also did my undergrad at Illinois, and I'm currently a grad student at one of the schools you listed.

How general is it, probably not really for carbon atoms? Maybe Drexler or those well aware of that angle et al can have another look at actually building shit. Those diamondoid devices have (in)glorious capabilities. (edit: i think not..)

The other, more likely route to "general molecular nanotechnology" is still via biotechnology.
> Why don't physicists consider running for office?

Because they are objective, rational and intelligent people.
As a physicist I can say that physicists are just people like anyone else.  Get more than one of them in a room and there will be politics, back-stabbing, nepotism, and anything really that you'd associate with any other group of people. Having training in physics is all that you can conclude from someone who calls themselves a physicist.  Not that they are good at anything else. 
Being a succesful leader of a country requires a very diverse skillset, many facets of which are on the social intelligence side rather than mathematical intelligence. You have to be great with people, communicate with leaders of other nations, cope with huge amounts of stress and many other stuff. Sure a physicist could have those properties. However, a talent for a very specific type of abstract thinking does not necessarily say anything about anything else. I would much rather have someone with experience in economics and geopolitics than someone who knows how to calculate path integrals. You could argue that being good at physics says something about your overall intelligence, but that's a thin point in my opinion. 
they do? Angela Merkel is a physicist. 

in case anyone doesn't know her : she's the German Chancellor. 
Because being objective, rational, and intelligent does not bring in votes.
Politics is way, way more complicated than what it looks like from the outside (just like physics). If you handle a single situation wrong or lose your cool, you lose everything (and I mean it). If you can make others lose their cool, you have a huge advantage. Then, you need to be a good negotiator. Being able to make rational decisions is of no use if you can't even convince anyone else that your idea is the best. On top of that, you need to actually know people, laws, loopholes, connections. 

I'd suggest you call a few politicians that are representing you and ask them to meet (yes, that can actually happen) and explain their job to you. It is pretty different from what you think it is.

On a sidenote, Angela Merkel is a physicist ~~and the former President of Germany Richard von Weizsäcker was, too.~~
Steve Chu was the Secretary of Energy.
[Bill Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Foster_(politician\)) a Congressman from Illinois was a particle physicist who worked at Fermilab.
Because people are not objective or rational. People are emotive. They want their emotions validated and their position empathised with. Not dismissed with a wave of the hand.

Politics is all about making people feel good, meeting in the middle and getting things done as well as knowing how to 'seize the moment'.

Physicists generally aren't fans of such middle grounds. There is one objective reality and one truth, there is a single optimal way to do things and the reasons for that are x y z.

Just my 2 cents.
I used to think this but more so for intentions than competency. If you have dedicated your life to **understand** the world instead of understanding the *economy*, there is something to be said for your perspective. However, there are many people who have not dedicated their life to a deeper complexity of understanding of the universe and are fantastic in politics. 

In Canada, our prime minister has a background in acting. I honestly am starting to believe that this is a fantastic background for a leader. Because as been stated in the comment section, you surround yourself with expert advisors, your job is to act the role. As long as you have a good mentality and intentions going into office, all you really need are good advisors and charisma. 
That's a good point. However, doing research in physics takes a lifetime of dedication. So I could only see physicists who drop out of research to be able to even consider such a thing.
I think the ~~superlatives~~ virtues you're attaching to physicists are more features of the field itself than the people who work in it. Physics, more so than other fields, is good at reducing natural phenomena to mathematical curiosities and finding solid-rock truths. But what allows physicists to do it is the availability of ample good experimental data, thanks to which they can reach the correct conclusion without having to apply the kind of careful reasoning scientists in observational sciences (sociology, paleontology etc.) are trained for. This makes physicists *less* inherently qualified for public office than scholars of other sciences, natural or social.

I'd say I would like more psychology professors in government positions because their knowledge is more fit to the kind of problems they'd face, but even they are not a guaranteed to be optimally competent. There is a difference between knowing a lot about martial arts and actually practicing martial arts.

edit: vocabulary
I reject the premise.

I grew up in a district represented by a physicist. In this last election I voted for another physicist (in a different state) for congress as well.

I surmise that the fraction of physicists in congress is pretty close to the fraction of Americans who are physicists.
For 2 atoms that are far apart, the interaction energy is small and the wavefunctions of the electrons are close to the wavefunctions of the uncoupled atoms.

When you bring the atoms closer together, they start to interact strongly and the electron wavefunctions will be very different (molecular bonds, and antibonds). 

You can define the "quantum boundary" for the Pauli exclusion principle by defining a parameter that will determine if the atoms are strongly coupled  or weakly coupled.

Theoretically, the Universe is a big quantum system, but the interaction energy between an atom in Washington and an atom on the Moon is much much smaller than the "internal" energy of the atom, if that makes any sense. (In the mathematical language of quantum mechanics, we say that the off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian are small compared to the diagonal ones. A purely diagonal Hamiltonian would be the representation of an unperturbed atom. The off-diagonals elements are the perturbative interactions.)

So to answer your question, you have to ask "What defines an interaction? When can we neglect the interaction?" This will tell you how to interpret the Pauli exclusion principle in your situation.
The problem here is that you're working with the 'ELI5' version of the Pauli exclusion principle. It's a nice simple way of stating the Pauli exclusion principle, "No identical fermions can ever be in the same state," but it isn't very precise. You can get confused, like in your example, "Well I have one atom with an electron in this state over here and I have another atom with another electron over there in the same state, is that allowed if the 2 atoms or separated or not or what?"


The more precise definition of the Pauli Exclusion Principle in the non-relativistic context is that the wavefunction must be anti-symmetric under the exchange of any two identical fermions. Mathematically, let x1, x2, ..... xN represent the coordinates of N independent particles. Then, there is a wavefunction for this system Psi(x1, x2, ..., xN). There is only ever one wavefunction and it describes the entire system. Any smaller systems contained in the total system do not, stictly speaking, have their own independent wavefunctions. What other people have pointed out is that if subsystems A and B are *weakly interacting*  then we can *approximately* write the total wavefunction as a product of a function that describes subsystem A times a function that describes subsystem B.

Armed with this knowledge we can state the Pauli exclusion principle more precisely in a mathematical way. The Pauli principle requires that Psi(x1, ... , xi, xj, ... , xN) = - Psi(x1, ... , xj, xi, ..., xN) for xi and xj the coordinates of 2 identical Fermions. Swapping xi with xj in the wavefunction must be equivalent to multiplying the whole thing by -1. 

With this statement of the principle, all this worry about whether we have 1 or 2 or 200 systems falls away. What we require is that for the wavefunction that describes the entire universe, swapping any 2 identical fermions must be equivalent to multiplying the original wavefunction by -1. If you have the situation where the wavefunction can be written as a product of 2 approximately non-interacting factors, the same principle applies, both within each sub-system and between the two sub-systems. 
You're asking good questions, but you should realize that you can ask the same exact questions in classical mechanics.

Ultimately it's up to you to choose what your *system* is, and what the *surroundings* are.

Of course in the case of QM and identical particles, Pauli exclusion complicates things since all identical particles should be described by a single (anti)symmetrized wavefunction for (fermions) bosons.

Another thing that helps to think about is that if you have one electron with you, and another on Mars, the overlap between their spatial wavefunctions is very small. So for all intents and purposes you can study your system (electron on Earth) and ignore the surroundings (electron on Mars).
when you have two atoms with electrons in the same state the electrons are in different places. so that doesn't lead to issues with the Pauli principle 

> Is there some quantum state related to location so that electrons that are far away from each other can have all other states identical to each other without violating Pauli?

yes. 

consequently there's no need to define the boundaries of a quantum system motivated by the pauli principle 
You make a model, and then you remove things gradually until you keep the desired behavior (spectra, etc) with the least assumptions possible. So maybe the coupling between the motions of two very distant atoms are not relevant, this depends on what you're looking to model.
I think you misunderstand what a quantum state of an electron is.

If you have two hydrogen atoms that are infinitely far apart (such that their interaction is zero), then the eigenstates of your electrons are labelled by the atom they are sitting on, in addition to the usual quantum numbers for atomic orbitals.

So your state would be for example |atom 1, 1s orbital, spin up>. You can then have another electron in |atom 2, 1s orbital, spin up>, since this is a distinct state.

Since our two atoms do not interact at all, it makes no difference if we treat them as one larger system or two separate ones.

Of course, if we bring the two atoms close to one another, they will interact and possibly for a molecule, in which case you should not treat them as separate systems anymore.
It seems like you're not understanding what a "state" is for the purposes of the Pauli exclusion principle.  It's a little bit messy because of the nature of quantum uncertainty, but if two things are definitely in different locations then they are in different states.

The sort of state that Pauli exclusion principle talks about is subject to the same sorts of quantum dualities as particles are.  In particular, there are many different ways to partition the state space, and what the world looks like in terms of position states may seem very different than that what the world looks like in terms of momentum states.

Regarding the question about quantum systems: One way to think about it is to say that everything we observe is all part of the same quantum system, and that when we consider a single atom - or some other subsystem - what we're really doing is making an approximation by assuming that stuff outside the subsystem doesn't have significant influence.  (Whether this kind of approximation makes good predictions can then be tested by experiment.)


wow thanks this is amazing!
That's a short paper.
Co-authored with Sandoval Vallarta, a Mexican physicist :) 
Not content with breaking RSA with quantum computing, Peter Shor seems to have his eyes set on lattice-based crypto now.
Background: I've been doing astrophysics professionally, through ups and downs, for over 20 years (25 since passing my quals).  

**(1) What motivates you to do your work/research?**

I "do" astrophysics because it's really effing cool.  I love being able to wrest secrets from the Universe through analysis, and to discover things that nobody has ever known before.  I love being able to interact (and engage in stylized intellectual combat) with some of the smartest people in the world.  

That said, I have frequently gone through "down periods" when I am not fully engaged with the work.  Generally these involve recovering from some particularly intense project or analysis.  It happens to everyone.  (I was told by my physicist dad that Einstein himself got demotivated after his qualifying exams.)

**(2) What values that are important to you come to fruition in your work?**

The spirit of inquiry, and the thirst for knowledge, are terrific.  It's hard to *over*emphasize just how awesome and unusual it is to work with people who (A) believe in a real world and a real truth that exists independent of all of us, (B) are actively engaged in a search for truth in that world, and (C) can distinguish between attacks on a particular idea, and attacks on their personal selves.  These values, when disseminated through society, make society better.  

We really do live in a single real world that exists independent of us, and the scientific method is the best technique humans have ever produced to discover more about it.  Spinoffs from scientific inquiry include pretty much every aspect of our society, from basics like having enough fertilizer to plant crops to feed the world -- to esoterica like how to make and organize billions of transistors into something like Reddit.  The scientific method has, in just 450 years, taken us to a world that would seem absolutely magical at the start:  we have clairaudience, clairvoyance, longevity, the (limited) ability to resurrect the dead, human flight, enough food, and a thousand other things as a direct result of that inquiry.  Continuing that line is the best way to ensure that humanity continues to advance and overcome the problems that face us today.

Bad though current problems like "global warming" might seem, we must remember that humanity has faced down existential crises before.  The Black Plague, smallpox, blights that caused famines, horrible wars such as the Mongol invasion, and a thousand other things have threatened humanity -- and modern science has tackled all of those, one by one.  Our best bet for surviving the next round of difficulties is to learn yet more about the world and use that knowledge to tackle the problems.

**(3) how can I better the world as a physicist?**

By carrying out your research and disseminating both your way of thinking and your research itself to the world at large.  Physics is hard and mostly quite abstracted from everyday life, and it is something that individuals do because they enjoy it.  Other fields, such as engineering or computer science or politics, offer a more direct connection to the current state of your local environment.  Remember that the enterprise of physics itself is a series of long shots:  each individual scientist has a tiny chance of producing a truly new discovery that may affect the world.  But both the way of thinking, and the combined efforts of the entire field, advance the world palpably and steadily.  

So thinking of the long game, serving as an example to others of clear thinking, and spreading knowledge rather than superstition and darkness -- these are the best ways you can better the world as a physicist.   
[this might help](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/)

As far as motivation, it really comes down to publishing. It's really rewarding working on a project and seeing it come to fruition. And how to better the world as a physicist? Well physics is about being able to solve complex problems, so you have to find one that means something to you and work for it. 

Feynman said something like: "Physics is like sex. It might have some useful purpose, but that's not why we do it."

Now, most people are not as brilliant as Feynman, so physics is not as fun for us as it was for him. But it's worth considering the idea that if fun or intellectual enjoyment is not a big part of your motivation, then maybe physics isn't the best career path.

On the other hand: it's easy to get burnt out in grad school, and that doesn't mean that you don't love physics. Burnout can be dealt with by easing up. If only we were free to do physics as a hobby, at our own pace, rather than ruining it by making it a job!
(assuming you are talking about academia)

I get where you come from, having been there myself. To be a physicist, or any other scientific discipline in an academic setting, you need more than intelligence and knowledge. You need to be self-motivated and this cannot be taught in my experience. Just like some people are left handed, some people can motivate themselves without exterior forces or peer recognition or what not.

That said, I came to the conclusion that my ground state self much prefers tangible, relatively fast results to extremely theoretical and far-away applications. I'm considering a career in medicine (will most probably never get in, but who knows). This profession has, to me, a great ratio of intellectual work to results. A physician needs to know a *lot* of things, but this is breadth first knowledge, not depth-first like someone doing a PhD. Therefore the impression is that you can be more useful in a wider variety of situations, and see the results of your interventions much more easily and faster than you would during a PhD. Note that some of my colleagues feel completely the opposite!! They want nothing to do with anything remotely "experimental".

This has great appeal to me. I will never be a Great mathematician, but I will always love mathematics. I will never be a Great physicist, but I will always love physics, etc. I think I could be a great physician, however, as that requires a distinct skillset. I reductively see the profession as being a sort of body mechanic/private investigator. And that appeals to me.

So... don't fight the Universe. If you lost your motivation for doing scientific research, that is *fine*. Some people figure themselves out at a very young age, others take more time. If after your MSc you don't want to continue doing research, then so be it. At least you will know yourself better, and that is *much* more valuable than any diploma or recognition you could get.

TL;DR: Get to know thyself. Pure science has tremendous potential to affect Humanity on a global scale. Other professions (like medicine) are much more local, yet can be very rewarding. Know thyself and be happier.
Deadlines motivate me more than living curves.
I read the book Life on Purpose. It really helps. I need a lot of motivation so I wrote my purpose on a slip of paper and keep it in my work ID. It really helps bump over the day to day BS. The larger BS is more of a struggle. 

Edit to add

In terms of values I read the book Lift: Being a positive influence ... One thing you do in that book is write down the values that you hold other people to. Then apply it to yourself. Guess what!? I was holding others to a higher standard than I was willing to stand up to. So I lowered my standards for others a bit and upped my own execution of standards for myself. 
[deleted]
1) Two main reasons: it's fun and interesting, and I am surrounded mostly by people who are a lot smarter than I am, as opposed to any other job I could do where I would be surrounded either largely or primarily by morons.

2) None really, except that I think a job should at least serve some kind of purpose, which being a researcher potentially does, and it makes being a researcher better than many an office job.

3) I think "bettering the world" significantly is too ambitious a goal and will set you up for disappointment no matter your career choice. A more realistic but still not straightforward goal would be to not make the world much worse than it is. Still, there is of course the potential for your research to have some kind of application in industry or society at large.

Asking the important questions.  I honestly just figured they were just "Tacky 70s graphic design, intended for curtains, carpets and textbooks alike #36"
I am guessing it is meaningless. I mean it shows up on his quantum book, and his fluid mechanics book, and so on. You could probably ascribe a meaning to it but I suspect you'd be projecting.

As an aside, Landau and Lifshitz really are gods of physics aren't they?
I just noticed that when you put them side by side like this http://www.kolmogorov.com/Landau.html then the smaller circles seem to form chains holding two bigger circles from different books together. 

... But at the end I think it's really the "tacky design" route.

I also want to make everyone still reading this aware of this post:

Simple answer: we don't know. 


To elaborate, string theory doesn't tell you at what scale supersymmetry should appear at. The natural scale of it from string theory is around the Planck scale, or perhaps the GUT scale. Both of these are a lot higher than what we can reach with present day experiments. People wanted supersymmetry to be around the energies the LHC could reach, since then it would solve some other theoretical puzzles, but this was never "technically natural" from a string theory perspective. 


So, we don't know, depending on your model it can be anywhere from our current exclusion limits to the Planck scale. People come up with a variety of different models and try to argue for why certain ones are better than others etc., but at the end of the day this sort of model building will never tell you anything you can trust without the experimental data to back it up.

Thank you all for educated responses. I've apparently hit just another wall of beyond-standard-model physics and thanks for letting me know that ^^
To contrast with the others who so far have answered an unequivocal "yes", wikipedia is correct when it sys:

> This primordial singularity is itself sometimes called "the Big Bang",[14] but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot, dense phase[15][notes 1] of the universe.

A physicist's use of the term "big bang" does not necessarily imply a commitment to a belief in an initial singularity, just a commitment to a previous very hot, dense phase of the universe.
That's Hawking's PhD dissertation; yes.
Yes, it's a singularity. There is a mathematical theory of singularities on almost-manifolds (they would be manifolds if it wasn't for the singularity) which I'm only vaguely familiar with, but I think this is where the Penrose thing comes from. He proposes that spacetime is a manifold with several singularities at regular 'intervals' and each one is a big bang.
It is my understanding that, as originally conceived, the big bang was a singularity. But then more research revealed the concept of inflation, which sort of destroys our ability to investigate a singularity. Thus, in modern usage, the big bang represents the set of initial conditions of the Universe that exists immediately after the end of inflation.

Pop-science source: http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/01/12/q-a-did-inflation-happen-befor/


EDIT: I am getting downvoted, but would be interested in hearing thoughts from other physicists on my explanation rather than just downvotes. I was surprised when I first read about this alternative meaning of the word, too. I always thought it referred to the singularity, but I don't think all physicist see it that way. For example, the book [*Beyond the Big Bang*](https://books.google.com/books?id=N3mHJlxA3PcC&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q&f=false) has a similar discussion, stating:

> "There is confusion over which moment should be called the Big Bang. Some use the term to refer to the Singularity. Others take some moment where our explanations concerning the Early Universe begin. I agree that the latter is a better usage. As, alas, common usage is not very exact, and a definition like this one is easily tripped over, I will avoid the term for most of the discussion."

I am under the impression that the observable Universe was contained in a point of zero volume but that all neighboring volumes of space were also contained in adjacent zero volume points such that the Universe was spacially infinite at t=0 while also being infinitely hot and dense.  
I suggest "Not Even Wrong" by Peter Woit as an antidote to the String Theory Kool-aid
In Quantum mechanics is it correct to say that given two operators, A and B are such that [A,B] ≠ 0 (i.e they don't commute), each of their measurements collapses the Hilbert space spanned by the wavefunction into two sets of linearly independent eigenfunctions. As they don't commute, the eigenfunctions that span the collapsed state when A is measured do NOT span the collapsed state when B is measured (and vice versa). 

Also, does this imply that if two measurements collapse the wavefunction into a state where they are spanned by the same eigenfunctions then the operators of the measurements commute. And what if the states only share say just one common eigenfunction? 

Also what exactly does he mean when he talks about values/measurements being deterministic? Is this in regard to re-measurement of a value obtained from a collapsed state? and/or does it have other significance?

And does it make sense to make a measurement that isn't an eigenvalue? I think not, because to be measured a value must satisfy something of the form Ax=λx, like for energy Hψ=Εψ. But then does the collapsed state have to be spanned by linearly independent eigenfunctions?

Sorry for all these questions, I'm not even sure if the questions make sense/are ridiculous. I'm an undergrad trying to reconcile all this in my mind, however unfortunately my lecturers seem more interested in me accepting statements than me really getting a good core understanding of the topic :(
How do you reconcile general relativity with the concept of a graviton? I thought that general relativity theorizes that gravity is produced by mass warping spacetime, such that it is not a force as Newton believed, but rather, a result due to mass. I'm puzzled because if general relativity is practically convention now, why is it that we still have a notion of a particle (i.e. the graviton) that mediates gravity? Are gravitons and general relativity at odds? 
When an electrical current passes through a liquid, does it generate an electric field inside the liquid along with it? If so, is there any way to know what the electric field lines for that field look like?
[deleted]
Do space and time as dimensions exist separate from particles of any kind or are they dependent on the presence of something else? 
I'm reading about weak interaction in order to write a report on it, but I'm having trouble finding useful information on it. I have a few questions:
1) What are some examples of weak interaction at work?
2) How do the charges of the bosons which mediate the force affect the interaction?
3) What causes a boson to be emitted from a particle?
4) Could I be directed to any sources that explain weak interaction for extra reading/citations?
Are there any intuitions about fundamental physics which are less accessible to us because we usually work in base ten (I've heard that base two is handy for computer applications; but that probably doesn't count since computer tech seems outside the scope of fundamental physics)?  And, if so, what might enable those intuitions better than base ten?
1) how many independent components does a symmetric matrix have?

2) you're counting dimensionful constants. These are pointless: your matrix is dimensionless (or is a dimensionful constant times a dimensionless matrix)

3) the number of independent components of the matrix must not actually necessarily match with the number of dimensionless constants. That's because 

- not all symmetric matrices are necessarily the matrix for some brick on a spring (linear map from parameters to your space of matrices is not surjective). I can count at least one obvious additional symmetry your matrix must have.

- two bricks on a spring could have the same matrix (map is not injective)
Can you explain in more detail what you want to accomplish?

It sounds to me like you want to describe the state of the system as a four-dimensional vector, V, with each dimension referring to the position along each of four independent dimensions. Then you want to describe the evolution of the system by an equation

d^2 V/dt^2 = MV

for some matrix M (or something like that).

Is that right? If so, you won't be able to do that because the system is not linear. If that's not what you want to do, can you explain your goal some more and say why a matrix is appropriate?
The problem with a question like this is that, because of basic structure a house will fall differently than say an office building.
When engineers build large buildings and use girders as the main support, they have to take into account the properties and shape of their girder, how rigid etc. then from here you can generally create a massive matrix (a few of them as you'll be solving massive systems of equations) whose eigenvalues should be proportional to the resonant frequency. 
I have a link to someone who actually knows what they are saying: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2winwa/how_do_you_find_the_resonant_frequency_of_an/?client=safari
Sorry I couldn't find a smaller link. 
Well I can't imagine they would oscillate differently than the tine of a tuning fork. https://youtu.be/CS0Ax_JM1iQ 

That is, assuming the construction of each floor is identical (sounds unreasonable; the bottom should be more reinforced) a building will wobble back and forth, with the amount of flex decreasing from a maximum value at the base to zero at the top. This leads me to conclude the ground floor might be a reasonable answer.

I think you need more information to give any kind of analytical answer though.
While the top floor will move the fastest, floors at vibrational nodes will experience the most stress and will therefore break first.
Earthquake engineering is what you're looking for.

It depends. Lets say that all floors have equal height, equal mass, same structural system and material used. Also, the openings are the same trough the height of the building. Building is a square in plan. Ground is stiff, so building is fixed to it (no need to model the ground), there is no chance of liquefaction. Center of mass and center of inertia are at the same point (no torsional effects). 


So, basically, the maximum transverse force and bending moments are at the bottom. Hence you can expect to collapse there.


However, due to different oscillating eigenvalues that can dominate and the unpredictability of earthquake signal it can turn out to be different. 
In the Northridge quake of 1994, it seemed to usually be the bottom floor, many 3 story apartment buildings converted in 45 seconds to 2-story buildings.  There were some taller buildings damaged from standing-wave resonances.
Just a wild guess, but u might wanna calculate the stress that's affecting the bottom floors, as they can collapse due to that aswell. (sorry for any technical mistakes or just words being used wrongly)

Schedule from last APS March Meeting:

It's hard to say what constitutes the "great unsolved questions" but any one of those subject headings indicates something that at least a few dozen (and up to order a thousand) people are actively working on.

Probably the "trendiest" thing right now is topological classification of matter. Topological insulators and superconductors have really taken off, with much more experimental progress in the former than the latter. (A slightly younger trend is topological semimetals, but while the insulators and superconductors may end up being realistically *useful*, I think this one's going to have been a fad: you can take tons of gorgeous ARPES pictures of topological semimetals, but for applied purposes, they're just, um, metals.)

I personally think, though, that the most important issue for (my own, wee, not bio/soft matter subset of) the field is the same thing it's always been: solving the quantum many-body problem. Of course, this will never *actually* be solved but that doesn't mean progress hasn't been made, and new and better tools developed (with a lot of activity coming from a nexus between condensed matter, chemistry, and quantum information).
Experimentally, 2D systems like graphene are getting a lot of attention. Also even Microsoft has taken interest in the discovery + potential uses of topological states of matter.

Theoretically, I think finding AdS/CFT correspondence in condensed matter systems is a fruitful topic that continues getting a lot of attention.
* Cuprates -- Unsolved but I've been told funding has shifted away from it
* 2D Materials -- Graphene, TMDC monolayers, etc.
* Computational Quantum Many-Body Physics -- DMFT, GW, etc.
* Topological Materials
Big unsolved questions:

* Is there any real use for topological insulators (apart from paper publishing)?
* Is there any real use for Weyl semimetals (apart from paper publishing)?
* Is there any real point to the fancy properties of graphene that theorists love, or is it just going to be useful as a transparent conductor?

And there's also high-Tc, I guess, which is not so much an unsolved problem as an undamped standing wave of argument.

I do simulations. The hot techniques I see now are parallel replica molecular dynamics and GW+BSE for electronic structure. We are also seeing coupled plasmon, phonon, and electronic structure calculations for exact photonic properties calculations. If you are a theorist, you might enjoy working on better algorithms for the parts of these simulations that scale poorly. For example, a naive Coulomb sum between ions takes O(n^2 ). But if you use FFTs you can get that to O(n*log(n)) and the fast multipole method can do it in O(n). 
One of the problems my groups is looking at at the moment is heat conductivity at interfaces. One of the major roadblocks in computing is the problem of dissipating heat away from your processor. You could overclock the crap out of your processor if you could just get the thing to cool down. So one of the challenges is to create a thermal interface between the processor and your heat sink with a really high thermal conductivity. This is why you put that thermally conductive paste onto the back side of your processor. 


Unfortunately, the materials we have at the moment for these thermal compounds suck. You have a bunch of pastes and greases that are reasonably deformable/have good flow properties at moderate loads, but whose thermal conductivity sucks. Then you have high thermal conductivity materials that wont conform to the interface. The common solution is to do something like add diamond grit or colloidal silver to a paste, but this greatly reduces the flow properties and leaves to air gaps due to the two surfaces being rough on the micro/nanoscale. And air really sucks as a thermal conductor.


So there's a lot of work going into new geometries and materials that can get around this problem.
I assume you have checked out the [official documentation?](http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/index.html)

I'll admit I have never used the python version of it but it looks a hell of a lot nicer than the c++. 
The best way to learn GEANT4 is by doing. There are a lot of examples available with the installation, go through those and pick out elements that you want to use.

I don't know how the interface with GEANT and Python works, but I'd recommend gaining some proficiency with C++, or at least object-oriented programming.
You can use neural networks for any kind of hypothesis test. For example, you could take data from some simple experiment, and use a neural network to test some hypothesis about your data.
A classical neural network application in astronomy is galaxy photometric redshifts. The idea here is it's quite observationally expensive to get distances to all galaxies in a survey from spectroscopic redshifts so neural networks are used to provide photometric redshifts from broad band images. The network is trained on some subset of data with spectroscopic redshifts and then applied to a whole survey. 
lab reports, basically just lab reports...

have to hand in 2 this friday, both basically done.

first one is about Photoemission spectroscopy and Low-Energy Electron Diffraction and we might have to add one or two more sentences explaining some of the images we saw.

second one is about measuring the lifetime if muons. trouble here is that we have to explain why the one of the methodes we are supposed to use doesnt give a proper result(200 seconds).

because it simply doesnt work for the effective data we have..

we also had/have to rework our report about the beta-decay experiment a bit.( identify the [lead x-ray peak](https://gyazo.com/028c597ab5669e2ba8ab7a8aaf205fa8))

and our supervisor for the experiment wants something done a bit differently than what the instructions say. which she told us after we handed in the report...

(Edit: great, now im pissed. i did what she wanted us to and the value i get makes 0 sense. i get 6 when i should get 6+-0.3, while with the old methode the biggest difference was that i should get 20 and got 28+-2, the best old value was 34+-2 vs 33,5...)

and to top things off we will have to do TWO experiments this week,"transversal vibrating sample magnetometer" and "optical emission and absorption spectrums", because the supervisor for the first one apparently doesnt have time at the date that we booked that one for...

i also still have lectures on solid-state-physics, "themodynamics and stastics" and "particle physics"

in the last one we are currently discussing basics stuff about the standardmodell. feynman diagrams, how to calculate some crosssections. and we just started talking about QCD.(basically no math, just effects)
Handed in my Bachelor thesis, got back the (informal) correction by my Professor. Gonna fix the small issues and formally send it to the exam office end of the week. 
I am setting up and packing our demo "portable" Hall thruster system for some public outreach presentations. I like this kind of things but it just takes so much time. 
Trying to design a reference whistle.  No matter how hard you blow, it will always be the same volume and the same pitch.

Harder than it seems. 
You are idealizing science too much. You did an undergraduate degree (which is a bad proxy for academic life), and still you are sure that being a quantum gravity researcher would have been "ideal" and your "most meaningful goal"? 

Life is much more than academia, and researchers/professors should stop spreading this lie that the only meaningful goal of a physicist should be to become a tenured professor. Academic life is brutal, stressful, badly suited for family life (and for life in general). I completed a PhD and a postdoc and I was just SO tired to have my advisor call me lazy all the time because I didn't "work 14 hours a days, 7 days a week" (sic).

You dodged a bullet, my friend. I now work as a Data Scientist and I'm super satisfied with my 38 hours/week. You will be more at ease and more helpful to your fellow human beings outside of academia (not to mention to your family and friends).
I've been there.  There's two angles to tackle here:

1) Stop putting down your own life.  Getting married, starting a family (if you are), and getting a decent job ain't nothing to be ashamed of, and it isn't easy.  You need to take it seriously, or it won't work.  If you don't enjoy your job, well congrats, you have a new meaningful job of getting one that you will enjoy.  Put your energy into that.

2)  Don't idealize a career in physics.  From your post, it's not clear you really have considered it, but academic life, particularly theoretical physics, is brutal.  Even if you get through a top PhD program, you're still looking at multiple post-docs (each of which you might very well not get) before your first adjunct.  There's a *lot* of very smart people that could have had your spot at any step along the way and you will have to prove you deserve it at every turn.   You will have to move every couple years and your significant other will have to find a new job every time.  You won't make what you will starting in a tech job until you get your first full professorship, and even then the hours will be terrible.  At this stage, saying "a career as a quantum gravity researcher would have been ideal for me" is like a high school athlete saying "a career as a pro would be ideal for me", minus the pay and fame at the end.  Like, you're not wrong, but there's a lot of middle stuff you're ignoring there.
>How can I live my life knowing I'll never achieve my most meaningful goal?

Are you dead yet? No? Then stop being melodramatic. Find out why you have been rejected and then correct the deficiency, or move on to something else and apply meaning.

If you like math heavy fields with obscure questions and no easily discernible right answers, try an Economics PHd instead.
This sub is really scary for an undergrad such as myself who thinks he wants to be a physicist. Literally everyone is just saying how it sucks and that you have to dedicate your life to it, which is my biggest fear. I want to study nature, but I also want to have a life and free time. Am I asking for too much?
There's always software engineer
Failed to complete my physics MSc a long time ago, mostly due to medical issues. My chosen field back then was non-linear (integrated) optics. Instead, like you, my first job was in a call center. Performed quite well there, and after less than a year I ran my own customer project, became the second IT guy and they offered me a permanent position. Did that for 3 years, was a fairly good job but quite underpaid due to my lack of paperwork.

Then my student loan repayment began, which was a wake-up call to look for a better job. I ended up at the national center for supercomputing where I did Unix and later Linux admin, which grew into sales-support, consultancy and design work, and a promotion about every 2 years. Left that job because of a change of management.

10 years after flunking physics, I ended up in my dream job: Supporting radio astronomy. I started out as a network admin, soon became responsible for maintaining all the network/Linux/network stuff. Got involved in R&D projects because of that, got to run my own workpackage on one of those. And just recently, I'm doing some actual (applied) physics/astronomy research, and am involved in the design of new astronomical instruments. I'm having an absolute blast. I'm co-author on a small number of papers. And a decade after joining this institute, there's serious talk about turning my research into a PhD project and then thesis.

I quite understand your feelings, I was also very disappointed to not get on the express train to PhD, postdoc, professorship and of course Nobel price. Having had a nearly complete academic education did give me a pretty big edge in the jobs afterwards: critical thinking and the ability to quickly pick up new subjects.

You asked for advice. And although your situation is of course quite different from mine, here's a few things that I think might help:

Keep up the self-study. I got into Unix admin at a fairly prestigious employer despite having no training or previous job experience, but simply because I had been using Unix systems personally for years already. I kept studying and learning, not immediately as a way to advance my career, but simply to satisfy my curiosity, improve things at work, and have fun. On my current job, I jut couldn't stop myself learning about the instruments, methods, observations we were doing.

This is probably the best time ever in history for self-study, thanks to open access journals, online academic courses, blogs, and more science news coming out every day than one could possibly keep up with.

My employer is actually very supportive of people studying to improve themselves. This is certainly something to look for when you grow out of the call-center business. Find something at the more applied side of science, where there is more room to contribute as a not-yet-academic. 

Be replaceable. If you're good at something, it is natural to want to hold on to that and to become irreplaceable for that part of the process. Instead, my advice would be to document, propose procedures, train others. If you're performing poorly, being irreplaceable might be desirable. But if you're doing well, it only drags you down. There's often much more valuable work that an employer simply isn't finding the people for, so be available for that. Case in point: I was doing so much R&D work that I couldn't also keep up with my standard unix/network admin duties. So initially they wanted to take me off those projects. I successfully argued that finding someone with my skill set at short notice would be nearly impossible, and suggested that we'd take on a new linux admin on instead. Which they did. And it worked out very well because everything I had built up in the years prior as the lonely sysadmin was actually documented, standardized and much simplified from when I came in.

As others have said: don't idealize the physics career path too much. We offer postdoc positions at my place, and they all struggle with how hard it is to maintain a relationship, publication pressure, and the near impossibility of landing a permanent position. It's harsh and it really makes me sad to see them leave again after a few years, to yet another postdoc, or dropping out. I kind of like my job security and the ability to contribute on a much longer timescale.

Finally: it does take putting your love for science and research above other things. I could have stayed in IT and made much more money. The last time I was looking for a job I ended up with 3 completed offers in hand. One of them a really well paid job in high-end Unix support. And at the other hand, a very modest salary increase and moving to the middle of nowhere to get closer to science. So I packed up and moved and haven't regretted that choice at all, but that might be a harder decision for you with a family depending on you.

You can't "settle down" and pursue a career as a researcher. You will have to move. A lot.

You're already at a major disadvantage compared to others - my advice: get a Master's and go work in industry.
I did about two years of undergrad work on a physics degree, loved the time I spent working on my major. It was a bad time to be studying in Detroit though and without a job I couldn't cope with the huge debt I was taking on to hopefully get into a very small field. So I dropped out, got back into an industrial job and eventually found myself here in a cozy house with a pretty cushy job building CNC machines. Currently there's three books on programming, one on game theory and two on physics sitting on my table. My mind definitely craves that challenge from time to time and I brush up yearly and always follow any real news from the field. Thankfully my current line of work isn't completely mind numbing either. In the long run I'll get back to school but it'll have to be once my son is a bit older. 
In a word: teach. You don't need to work as a teacher, just teach physics. As an undergrad, I can't say much to not succeeding as a physicist, but I know without a doubt that teaching is one of the best ways to stay connected with physics, and it's incredibly rewarding. Through teaching, I have learned so much more about physics than I ever would as a student. It's not pushing the boundaries of science, but if you got into physics because you love to learn, i would recommend that you teach in some setting. If you are still looking into grad school, there are many possible, albeit less conventional, ways to get in. Working at national labs or in industry can provide valuable research experience that PhD programs look for.

Edit: I know that I didn't answer your question, but I hope that it helps.
I think my conception of my most meaningful goal has changed through time. In my thirties, I don't think of myself as a failure because I didn't complete all my goals in my twenties, and I'm sure my forties will be the same for what I think I want now.

I guess it depends on what it is you want(ed) from a career as a quantum gravity researcher. Was it the knowledge you were advancing understanding of science? A high school physics teacher can make that claim too, for example.

Was it the *process* of doing research? That process can be extrapolated out too.

Was it that you had invested too much of your identity in what you hoped your career would be? I don't know how to answer that one, but you're getting married. It's not unlikely you'll have kids. Those circumstances are pretty good in refocusing your conceptions of what it means to find success and fulfillment, I've seen.
If this level of struggle and not achieving your goals leads to such feelings of failure and giving up, theoretical physics is probably not for you. What you've felt so far is nothing compared to what's to come.

On the other hand, if you work through these challenges, you may learn and grow to handle those later challenges.

Even Einstein had to take a job as a patent clerk in Switzerland before bouncing back.
While I was working in a kitchen to put myself through undergrad, the Head Chef told me something I often have tell myself:

"You work to live; you don't live to work."

After college I started working in production at a semiconductor factory and very shortly afterward I was offered an entry level engineering position based on my performance and educational background. Mechanical Engineering was my chosen career path; I was beyond stoked.

One month later, during my training, I was laid off because the company was being downsized. I was hopeful that I could find a similar opportunity, but the job market was terrible and I had to take a call center job just to make ends meet. I graduated from the call center into external tech support, and then to IT work. I'm currently training to become a systems administrator which is my career goal, adjusted for the capricious nature of life.

Am I bitter AF about the opportunity I lost? Absolutely. However, I have a job I don't hate, and it pays the bills with a little left over each month, and that's about what any person has the right to expect out of life. I have to remind myself from time to time that I am not defined by my career, and my life outside of work is what really matters.
I feel exactly the same.  I'm now teaching high school and working on mastering (quantum, e&m, GR) physics in my "spare time", the little I have.   Eventually I'll get there!  I still haven't given up.

Each yeah I study for and take the physics GRE with notable improvement.  My estimate is within 7 years I'll be teaching physics at a university and finally have a chance at doing real research too.

Keep pushing and don't give up!!!
You wouldn't have made it as a quantum gravity researcher. There's like one professor position that opens up every four years and it's taken by whoever the biggest prodigy in field is. Unless you're a savant with super human mathematical skills, you wouldn't make it. I was doing my PhD in QG. I know a lot of people that did their PhD in QG aka I know a lot of instructors and software engineers.
Don't worry. Quantum gravity is just really small gravity, and gravity is just the feeling you get when you fall off of a tall building. So, unless you like falling off of buildings, you should be glad that the feeling is quantumly small or you'd be really scared all the time. However, if the feeling is what you are chasing, you should just take up skydiving. It's the same as having a whole bunch of quantum gravities, but all at the same time so really scary. Or I guess ghost hunting would also be just as good.
Responsibility is cool, but there's more things in life


Like getting your dick rode all fucking night.
I got a double major in math and physics, hoping to go to a PhD program in some sort of nuclear physics. During my undergrad, I interned at a national lab, but got stuck doing electrical engineering projects. At the time I was pretty bummed out, but I ended up working on some cool shit and people started to take notice of my work. 

Fast forward to today, I'm a wireless engineer focusing on consumer technologies (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, NFC, etc). I did end up getting accepted into a grad program after my BS, but for information engineering. I weighed the cost benefit and realized I could dive into industry, learn just as much about wireless tech, and get paid more and right away. 

I make good money in the Silicon Valley. I have a fast paced job working on cutting edge tech, but I still feel pretty empty not working to become or as a physicist. Sometimes I read research articles and solve old quantum mechanics problems from my old notes just to feel "in the game". Looking back, I'd trade the freedom, the relationships, and money to work in physics research. What I do now seems so terrestrial and unimportant. I'm even worried I'll become a complete rat in the race and forget the big picture that is the study of the universe. 
> I truly love physics and know a career as a quantum gravity researcher would have been ideal for me.

I think you're focusing too much on superficial aspects of work.  You decided what you want your job title to be instead of figuring out what you want to actually be *doing*.  

What kind of problem solving do you want to be doing?  What do you want your relationships with your coworkers to look like?  How do you want your job performance to be evaluated?  Figure out your ideal work environment and then look for jobs that match it.  You will end up more satisfied that way than if you focus on one single job (which, frankly, I suspect you chose more for the prestige of being a "quantum gravity researcher" than for the work itself, especially if this is a decision you made while reading pop science books in high school).
I went all the way and got a PhD in physics from Harvard. But at the time I graduated there were academic jobs for only 1 in 10 PhDs. So most needed to find something else to do.  lots of my class went on to do management consulting. Not for me though.

I did a short postdoc then decided to do programming and it was the right choice.  I learned programming as a side effect of the PhD work. I just didn't have the obsession needed to make it in academia. Don't get me wrong I loved my time doing the phd you'll never go into a subject as deeply as then. But if you do something else there are so many more options, like what city you want to live in etc. And the pay is better :)
While you're figuring out what to do about your physics ambitions, look for more fulfilling work than in a call center. With a physics degree, there are a lot of options. You might find other careers that you truly love, but that's unlikely in a call center.
You're not a physicist now? Say's whom?  Just because society is willing to pay me substantially more money to do something other than my personal passion; does not mean my training and passion went away.
I dropped out of a physics Ph. D program and am now a software developer / DBA / Linux sysadmin. I bailed because there is far more competition for positions in physics, which means (1) a casual like myself could never make it and (2) the ones who do are very "driven". ^^^(dogwhistle)

Went back and got a Master's, then got a CS degree. The work is interesting and meaningful, the people are nice, and I'm not surrounded by people trying to keep from drowning by pushing me down.
Why aren't you writing to professors and cultivating relationships?  Find someone you trust or admire and ask them for suggestions on which material to study.
[This is for phd](https://www.aip.org/news/2015/report-careers-outside-academia-are-richly-rewarding-phd-physicists). There is one for Bachelors. This was just bookmarked so linking here. This site offers a good research data on careers of physicist. Something that will help.
You could learn to program and start contributing to open source science software libraries.
Try again, maybe aim a bit lower (i.e. something other than quantum gravity.) Nothing stops you from learning about it on your own time.

The most important thing is to keep moving. If you don't want to wake up 5 years from now sitting in the same call center, you have to keep on learning and disturbing your equilibrium. I got in a good grad school but with basically 0 support (not that the PI didn't *want* to give any, but rather that they didn't really foster a cooperative and lively environment, and I lost my interest).

I spent 3 years there doing mostly other things than my project. I learned a huge amount of things but they weren't directly related to my thesis. So in the end, I found a job nonetheless because I had developed useful skills.

I suggest you keep challenging yourself because it's so easy to fossilize in a state of relative happiness/stability. Not that there's anything wrong with any job in particular, but if you don't like yours, there's really nothing else you can do but force yourself out of your equilibrium.

Good luck.
I got halfway through my degree then realised I didn't want to continue physics.

I finished that degree, got out and now I love physics again.

It's what I do to procrastinate, why couldn't I do that as a student!?

I'll always hAte what I do
Couldn't be happier. My life has improved dramatically in every way. I can afford to travel, can afford to buy real estate, and some other nice things while my job has transitioned to a data science role that I quite like and is not at all *that* different from what I was doing before. Flexible hours, nerdy environment, but making 3x what I was making before.

All my dreams in physics were about gaining understanding. When it comes to my career and expectations in life, academia could simply not fulfill them. 
Hey op, I can't really help you but I thought I'd share what's on my mind since I can relate. I'm 17 and I've been into "science" since always (lots of discovery channel, animal planet, tons of kids encyclopedias when I was little). I like math and other logic oriented subjects too, like programming, but physics above all. I've always been curious, good grades, sort of smart... but these last years physics became a bit of an obsession. Like you I read popular science books, I read textbooks, teach myself calculus a bit, I practice for and participate in those national physics competitions we have etc. I do enjoy solving problems but the allure of physics comes from learning how the universe works, being able to look at something ordinary and to imagine all the stuff happening on every scale, the energy, forces etc. and being able to describe all of that with math. My point is, I think I enjoy learning theory more than applying it and I thought I wanted to become a physicist (a bit general but I don't have a specific field in mind) but while I'm of above average intelligence I'm nowhere near as talented as some. And as other people mentioned, a career in theoretical physics is not easy to pull off. This makes me doubt my chances of success in more academic fields but when I think of learning something more practical, perhaps engineering-related, I don't quite feel the same fascination but rather like I'm settling for something mediocre when I could be doing more significant things. And basically your situation right now is one of my biggest fears. 
So yeah, I mostly wanted to get this all out, I doubt anyone will bother reading the whole thing but some help with career orientation would be welcome. And good luck op, I really hope it works out for you.
Funny, I also would have liked to go into quantum gravity, because i think thats where everything will come together. 

For me physics was very challenging but with little reward. Like in the same time that I would need to learn an undergrad course I could have mastered 2-3 courses in engineering or smth different. 

So yeah, I'm currently doing a masters degree in physical engineering. Its not as fundamental as theoretical physics but its still challenging, it teaches a lot of different skills and is somewhat easier.

Its somewhat romantic to think about theoretical research. But what I would have hoped from it is to make a fundamental discovery, some groundbreaking widening of the horizons of our knowlegde. But Im pretty sure this just wont happen unless I work reeeaaaally hard, like 20h/day 7 days a week thinking about physics problems, reading research papers etc. This just wont happen.

There are also some other interests that I have and would like to persue.
I was a physics major until junior year, when I switched to anthropology. I'm a bartender now. All I do with my physics knowledge now is dazzle drunk customers. Or, I occasionally get to expose someone who's talking out of their ass to try to impress women.

EDIT: You may still achieve your most meaningful goal. You just don't know what it is yet.

My friend won a business competition to start a guitar pedal company. I'm working for him designing a loop pedal! It's not physics really, but I still get to be hands on with electronics and I get to play music and think creatively to solve problems so I'm happy! Still wonder about what could have been if I went to Grad school and continued further... 
Just finished my computer programming diploma.

Still hear about cool physics here
Quit my master's after about a year, and felt guilty as fuck.

Then I started translating, and now I'm happy as fuck, and make more money than I ever would have as a physicist.

I still miss it. I miss the lab, and I miss working on the big questions (and little ones,  like "why the fuck doesn't this circuit work?!?").

But 13 years later, I'm happy and regret nothing. 
Have you considered a national lab? I work at one doing fairly research-heavy stuff. I've just got a BSc, but the pay is quite good. I could picture myself doing this for a long time.
I am an on again off again undergrad in physics, I am currently attempting to get a job with spacex as a logistics technician, falling back on my military experience to get a job that is not as sexy as research and development of high power ion engines like I wanted, still pushing forward on my goal of taking humanity to the stars.
Recently graduated with a physics degree from a large school with a good reputation for research. I spent three years doing research, coauthored two papers, did poster and oral presentations, yadda, yadda, would have had a good application for graduate programs ... but I hated the research part. 

I couldn't stand it. I stuck it out through my undergrad years because I felt like I owed it to the professor I was doing research with. Doing research made me see that I didn't want to continue in physics.

So ... I went to law school instead because I guess I'm a masochist.

But I'm really loving law school. Physics prepared me for the rigors of law school way better than English or Political Science would have. Since I was beaten down by four years of physics, law school isn't so bad.

Ultimately I want to make some use of my physics degree and practice patent law but I am steering clear of academic physics.
You should look for post-baccalaureate work in a field close to what you want to study, or in physics of any kind. Ping your old professors for advice and possible opportunities. You'd have to move for grad school anyway, so be open to moving to a place with a national laboratory or a good research university. After a year of post-bac work, re-apply, but by then you may have a publication, and letters from people who actually know your work. Oh, one more thing, when/if you get a job, *work like hell* and try to stay positive about it.

Remember, before you take a job (or go off the grad school), make sure the other people working there, or for the same boss, are relatively happy with their situations. Keep your eyes open.
While I'm no physicist, a friend of mine is. He worked in a lab for a while before deciding that his passion for making music outweighed his love of physics... at least for now. 

If you want to check out his stuff, it's www.keithjohns.co  

There have been quite a few articles written about him in local newspapers detailing his odd switch from physics to folk. Check him out!
Bleh, yeah, I've been interested in quantum gravity for ~6 years now, and decided to go back to school for it 3 years ago. Only recently (a few months ago) did I realize that, despite the overwhelming amount of physicists in the field urging young people to join in, there is far too much competition for the few spots available. I still plan to finish my undergrad, but it's seeming more and more like it's simply unrealistic to dive into it via the straight academia route.

The worst part about my situation is that I'm getting my undergrad at a school that has *zero* theoretical physicists. There aren't any general relativity or field theory classes offered. Everything I know about QG, I taught myself. There are no teachers to even talk to about it, and for my senior seminar, I can't do it, because they wouldn't be able to review it. That was my last hope; if I did a research project applying Bayesian networks to AdS/CFT, it might give me a competitive edge...but my school doesn't even have a computer science program.

At this point I'm gonna go back into IT, either programming or getting network certifications (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE)...it still pays well, and the plan is to get a job in San Francisco, maybe visiting Stanford to sit in on seminars or graduate level classes to keep up with the field. I may not be able to spend most of my time on the stuff, but hell, I'll be making more money doing an (apparently) much less stressful thing. There's also nothing saying that you can't co-author a paper without working at a school.
Move to the UK and become a comedian. 
Chancellor of Germany.
Physics is where you find it, my friend.

And rest assured, nothing is simple or just as it may seem today.
So my goal is to get a job in astrophysics with whatever university I wind up going to within the next few years(I am 18 now). I wanted to get my masters first, try to find a job in the university, and then finish getting a PhD. Does this seem like an unrealistic goal if I also wanted to consider having a family later on in life? Maybe at least spending ~10 years trying to establish my career before starting a family? 
the energy is in molecular bonds. chemical reactions take place, so chemical bonds are broken up, the atoms rearrange in different bonds, the total energy is less than before and the excess energy is released as heat. that's basically burning.
It's been quite a while since I've programmed a GPU but I believe /u/ffwiffo 's point:

>Your question can be answered completely - yes GPUs give the same accurate results as non GPUs.

Is fundamentally incorrect.  There are many operations on GPUs, generally reduction operations, which are not deterministic due to the asynchronous nature of computation and the resulting rounding.  Additionally in GPUs you're typically confined to floats (with non-deterministic reductions), so you do have issues.  I don't know to what extent the newest generation of GPUs, specifically designed for HPC, have addressed this.

That being said, pretty much any numerical approach is approximate regardless, so small numerical errors are irrelevant provided the algorithm is stable in terms of the pragmatic accuracy of predictions.

EDIT: Apparently, new GPUs with capability "1.3" can do doubles arithmetic.
Your question can be answered completely - yes GPUs give the same accurate results as non GPUs.

The instruction set on a GPU is smaller than a CPU but highly vectorized, which makes them good candidates for supercomputing because essentialy supercomupters are giant vectorized machines. 

Also, the difference in architecture between a GPU and CPU doesn't mean there any mistakes being made.
As long as the programmer has taken steps to avoid rounding errors, which every computational physicist is taught to do (hopefully), then there is no difference in the quality of math computed with a GPU over a CPU.

>For example if I want to calculate the pressure of a plasma on a surface dose GPU can give me the exact number or the answer is wondering around the right number??

The GPU and the CPU give the same number: an approximation. Computing is done with discrete mathematics, if you want an exact answer do it by hand.
The Feynman Lectures on Physics is one of the most famous publications on physics, and Caltech recently put it all up online for free ( http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/ )

> why do measurements have meaning at all when they are measuring components of a single thing?

Most likely your intuition is failing you. Ignore combined spacetime for a moment and just think about R^3 euclidean space. You could ask the same thing about measuring along the x dimension (as compared to the y or z dimensions). But you don't. Why are you balking when time is added as a dimension but not y and z? 

I mean this not necessarily to lead a an "ah ha" moment but as a framing device. Consider your assumptions and intuition careful as you think about why one doesn't make sense (time as a dimension of spacetime) but the other does (x, y and z as independent dimensions of R^3 in euclidian space despite R^3 being a single thing). 

> if distance and time are the components of velocity, they are just seemingly two different measurements of the same thing (space-time) being compared to themselves

Velocity has two components (direction and magnitude). But at it's core you're right that the distance traveled and the time required to travel it makes up the magnitude portion. 

Again, go back to what is comfortable. I'm assuming you're comfortable with the idea of a slope on a line (which can be described as the magnitude of change of the line)? It's defined as nothing more than dy/dx. x and y in this case are both part of the same thing (the R^2 euclidean plane) but the ability to derive meaning in terms of the slope of the line should be obvious. Spacetime and speed (magnitude) is no different.  
the three space directions are also part of the same thing, space, yet you can measure length of a one-dimensional thing.

>For example if distance and time are the components of velocity, they are just seemingly two different measurements of the same thing (space-time) being compared to themselves

space and time are not components of velocity. velocity depends on the change in position over a time, but that doesn't mean it has to do with spacetime coordinates directly.

you probably should start with classical mechanics and get a  good intuition of that first, before considering relativity and spacetime.
[I hope that this will help you](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zScn3tV9YPU)
First, tensors aren't intrinsic to relativity. They are used within good old 3D space in other contexts, most notably fluid mechanics and EM.

The point of using them in relativity is that you want to look at things in the context of spacetime. The relativistic transformations and laws are best understood in Minkowski spacetime, which is a four dimensional vector space with a slightly weird inner product: one which has a minus sign in the time component. Using tensors and index notation for this makes everything easier.

I gotta say though, I don't understand what Bergmann is trying to say from your quote. It's true that in a Galilean transformation time remains intact and that it mixes with the other coordinates under a Lorentz transformation, but I don't understand what "t retains its customary position" means. You can't formulate laws in such a way that t doesn't transform, because it does. Unless he means proper time, which is a scalar.
>I guess this means that relativistic laws can be reformulated so that t transforms onto itself like in the classical laws?

It's the other way around, you want laws to transform according to special relativity. Classical laws are *covariant* respect to Galilean transformations, but now you would like to have laws *covariant* to Lorentz transformations. Tensor notation/calculus is so that you can construct new objects that transform according to special relativity.

Tensors are just multi-linear maps, they pop up all over physics.
Either your problem is already linear or you linearize it in some
point.

My prof highlighted the fact that we want our equations to look the same in every inertial system. 
I found tests at school extremely easy, got into a top university in the UK for physics, and then found that when I had tests that were actually challenging that I massively lost my nerve and did very badly in test conditions.

I got lucky and got a phd at a much lower ranked university and am now an early career researcher, with reasonably good prospects of carrying on in this field, so it is possible.

All that said, however, I did get lucky a few times in terms of what I ended up doing, and I am also in a highly experimental / near engineering field, and I am genuinely very good at experimental and practical work. I feel like you may be worse off in theoretical areas.
My undergrad average was much less than 80% (not prepared to admit what it was exactly, though ;-) )

The key thing I've found is, if you can get into a niche field which you're genuinely interested in but isn't especially "sexy" or "exciting" then you can find a lot of opportunities.

Interesting idea. You should look into astrophotography tutorials to capture the sky more clearly.

Should have waited for a cloudless night. Pretty cool, otherwise. I want to see the Sun and the shadows more clearly now. 
it takes a long time to build reactors and governments are not willing to put enough money in. besides i would advise searching this sub, as well as /r/science, /r/askscience, /r/askphysics. there's a lot of big threads discussing all the details of fusion.

iter.org has a lot of information

https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/46k5y4/science_ama_series_hi_reddit_were_scientists_at/

here's an ama of wendelstein 7-x physicists from 2016 and they discuss a lot of these questions.

https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qdbxg/askscience_ama_series_we_are_nuclear_fusion/

here's another, older, ama, 2012.

that said, you speak of becoming a nuclear physicist. but i think you wouldn't really be concerning yourself with fusion necessarily (as building a reactor is now mostly an engineering problem. the necessary fusion reactions have been figured out). there's a lot of processes going on in nuclei regarding the strong and weak nuclear forces, that are probably closer to what nuclear physicists deal with.
The physics of scale. In order to increase the efficiency of the the reactor there are several factors you can change, one being reactor size, another one being magnetic confinement field strength. At the time ITER was planned, we hit a wall in terms of magnetic field strength in super conducting magnets. The field was so strong that it disrupted the super conductivity causing the field to collapse.

So the only way to move forward from there was to build a huge reactor. Unfortunately the consequence of that is that the project goes from being national scale to international scale, in terms of financing, with all the politics that comes from that slowing down the process.

Another more subtle thing that you dont hear too much about is the the reactor material issue. The reactor wall gets bombarded with neutrons, which gradually breaks down the material.  In addition, the reactor wall needs to contain lithium because it needed to breed tritium which is one of the fusion reaction components. This is one of the causes of the breakdown. Lithium is a difficult material to deal with in itself. But it has to be engineered into a wall segment that you can stop the reactor and replace when it gets worn out. Some people in the fusion business will tell you it is probably impossible to get this working properly in a production reactor, based on the ITER design.

So now ITER looks a bit like a dead end, but we still have this problem of the world needing increasing amounts of electricity, and we can't burn more fossil fuels, in fact we have to cut that way back in order for rampant global warming not to become a serious civilization threatening issue, so we keep pressing on, because the potential benefit, if we can make it all work is so promising.

A lot of people have realized that going big is probably not viable and have started to reinvestigate previously abandoned fusion experiments, to see if new technologies could help make those approaches viable again.

Here are some videos worth watching on a couple of the alternative approaches:

General fusion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m9kC1yRnLQ

MIT experiments - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4
You would probably find the Omega Tau podcast on ITER to be interesting. It goes into a lot of the details of the goals of current fusion projects and current issues. 

Fields that could be relevant, in no particular order:
- physics 
- nuclear engineering
- materials science
I wrote a bit about that [here](http://klotza.blogspot.jp/2016/08/whats-deal-with-fusion-power.html). Basically, a profitable machine would have to be so huge and resource intensive that nobody is willing to invest enough to make the investment worthwhile.
The estimate I have heard was 30 years. It just takes a while with finite funding and manpower I suppose. So far they have studied fusion in JET for non-commercial use. They have not even reached the break-even point there (the point where you get more energy out than you put into heating). Next one will be ITER, which is supposed to finish construction in a few years. They intend to demonstrate that outputs well above the break-even point are possible. Then if that goes well (10 years maybe?) DEMO follows, a project that is supposed to build a reactor that could in theory be a first prototype commercial use reactor. Note that I'm no expert but recently attended a lecture on this. 
Carbon dating is useless for telling you the age of a prehistoric fossil. It's one tool used in tandem with many other analytical methods in order to find out when something was once "alive". The point is that we use carbon dating because it's remarkably accurate when it's applicable. 

The reason for this is because other methods are generally INDIRECT ways of dating something (i.e. geologic strata, using anatomy from known biological lineages, etc.), whereas carbon dating is a DIRECT way to measure the age of something, thus providing direct evidence.

Also a big BIG BIG plus of carbon dating (and all other non-faith based methods of inquiry) is that it will tell you exactly how wrong it is (i.e. it'll give you a range). I've never met a creationist who'll tell you when they might be incorrect about something.
It depends on the nature of the thing, the (real) age of the thing, the condition of the thing (including site conditions, storage conditions, ), the size of the thing.

Carbon dating uses the ratio between an unstable form of carbon (which decays at a precisely known rate) and a stable form of carbon to determine how many "half-lives" have gone by since the sample died. 

The technique depends on the initial ratio in the atmosphere at the time the sample lived. In the early days of radiocarbon dating about 60 years ago, the atmospheric ratio was assumed to be constant. Subsequent experiments showed that this was not the case and calibration tables to correct for that were developed using independent techniques.

The "half-life" of the unstable *isotope* of carbon (I.e. carbon-14 or C14) is about 5000 years. Because half the amount of carbon-14 "evaporates" for every "half-life", after a certain amount of time (about 10 half-lives), there is not enough C14 to calculate a ratio. 10 half-lives of C14 is about 50,000 years. That is the limit for successfully using carbon dating.  There are other techniques (including radioactive decay techniques) for dating older objects, but the don't rely on carbon-14. Because of the half-life limit of carbon dating, it cannot be used to date dinosaur fossils (>65 million yo), or different early hominids (>250k yo).


In fact, because fossilisation involves the replacement of the original organic material with minerals, actual fossils can't even be carbon dated in principle. The original carbon has been replaced. 

There are limitations on carbon dating (organic material, <50k yo, contamination issues, filter-feeder difficulties, ) but the limitations are well understood now. There are chemical and genetic techniques to help detect contamination. Equipment can detect an individual carbon-decays. 

In the time range and sample range where it's applicable, it is accurate and the limits on the accuracy can be measured or calculated .

It is important to also compare the quality of evidence from the scientific side and the creationist side. There are literal and figurative mountains of evidence from dozens of independent scientific sources against the Christian Bible being a literally accurate re-telling of actual historic events beginning 6000 years ago.

What actual evidence does your friend use in support of the claims in their holy book. The book itself is not evidence. The book is the claim. Most of the time, I see creationists try to argue against the scientific evidence (as in this case) and then assume victory without presenting any evidence to support their claims at all.

A lot of people mention length, you have to decide - is this a resume or a CV? Resumes are short and general listing skills rather than experience (they are not usually used at high levels of academica, I no longer maintain a resume as a postdoc and haven't since I started grad school). CVs are meant to be every accomplishment ever (keep it academic though), some professors have short and long CVs and the short ones are still a couple pages. 

That said about the CV part, these guys are reading a million of these, if you go the CV route make sure the important information is first, the things they want to see because chance is they aren't reading the whole thing (unless you're in the final cut). The most important thing they want to see is Research experience, and congrats you have pretty extensive research experience for your level.

I don't know why GPA is mentioned twice, put it with the education part. 

Does your relevant coursework include next semester? You'll have completed that by the start of the summer, so put something like "will have completed by Summer: Electrodynamics II, or QMII or ..." Your coursework so far is only the basics required of the degree, will you have advanced topics classes by the summer? Particles/Condensed matter/PChem, for math Abstract Alegebra or some other topics course?

Good luck!
Remove your name and personal information and post a link. Also, as an undergrad you should be fitting everything onto a single page resume unless you have a lot of publications already.
Keep it 1 page, you're still in school.

What courses have you taken? Might be more useful than what you have as interests there.

Have your gpa with your BS.
I think I once used that same format and a lot of the same skills. Resumes are highly subjective, but these are my suggestions after spending a lot of time on my own resume: 

* Use a denser format. There is a lot of white space. A resume should always be one or two pages, never one and a half. Fit everything on one page. Use up all that space in the margins. Something more like [this](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d956d170a6fd16efee7a7b48e97db9b9-c?convert_to_webp=true) (but do NOT use that font).

* Try to think of the most relevant questions a person reading this will want answered and put those answers at the top. First, are you really interested, or are you just shotgunning resumes anywhere and everywhere? Include the name of the program in the Interests section (see below) and be sure to make it clear you have done research on the program and have an idea of what you'd want to do there. Next, are you qualified? You have an excellent GPA and should be proud of it! Put it near the top. Also, rename "Academic Positions" to "Research Experience" or "Academic Experience" or something like that.

* This restriction may be relaxed for a small REU program, but your resume should be "computer readable." I ended up rewriting my resume in Word because programs designed to sift resumes will have a much easier time with Word-resumes than LaTeX.

* **Interests** should be reworked into a sentence or two that expresses the goal of this resume as well as your interests. This in particular should be customized for the particular REU program you're applying for. Use the name of the school and department.

* Ditch "Languages & Software," its redundant. Include a short list of the stupid stuff, like Excel, Word & PPT alongside your other more interesting skills. 

* This is highly subjective, but I was a lot more happy with my resume when I used short, descriptive paragraphs describing my experience and expertise than when I used bullet points. Similarly, I dropped bullet points on my version of the "Awards, etc." and "Coursework" section and listed everything in a kind of borderless table or delimited with "|". Takes up much less space and doesn't break the flow of the resume as aggressively as those big bullets do.   

* Condense Posters and Talk into one section. Do the same to "Scholarships, awards, honors" and "professional and academic societies." Generally, the description of the "list" should not be longer than the list itself. 


What is your metric for how "good" a cloud chamber is? It's a detector, so as long as you can see particle trails, it's good enough and doesn't really need to be more "efficient."

What I would recommend is using the cloud chamber as a measurement device for a project involving radiation.

Shielding and interaction with E/M fields would be interesting to look into as project ideas. Especially the field interaction, since that's something you can explore with a cloud chamber but not with a Geiger counter.

If you don't have radiation sources (which it seems like you might not have from another comment you left), crack open a smoke detector or go to an antique store and look for some orange Fiestaware or glow-in-the-dark clocks!
Sounds like your teacher doesn't understand what a cloud chamber is.
A wise man once said that the difference between science and just secreting around I'd writing it down.  I'd suggest getting it working, then taking it different places and take measurements.  Every day places like your bedroom, your basement, the classroom world work, but other cool locations like a mountain top or down a mine shaft would be really cool.
Wait, what will you use for a radiation source? Do you have the proper paperwork for said radiation source?
Tuning the operational parameters you have control over (whatever they are) and measuring how well the thing works should qualify.
Interesting that it was not quite 5 sigma. 
Does this mean we could make pure light-light colliders?  Would that even be useful?
Thanks for posting this.  

This topic is my totally favorite part of physics.
So I spend alot of my time also doing laser spectroscopy, specifically Raman. 
There was a time where I was investigating a sample and noticed that there was a lot of broadband signal in the spectra, to the point where I thought I had generated a supercontinuum laser somehow by exciting multiple states at once. 
I repeated this over the sample again and again and there was no doubt in my mind that I had created white light. This light was even bright and easily visible to the eye.
Eventually, I realised that I had the power meter the wrong side of the beam splitter and was actually putting 10x more power on the sample than I had thought. Basically i discovered fire by burning the sample so not a great discovery.

Far from a nobel, but at least two times I've had a "new" idea for my field that after a patent search turns out to be published that very same year.

Once I did not find anything and got really excited, about 3 months later the patent came out (so I had the idea during the blind 18 month period, but the patent was filed before).
In undergrad, my lab parter and I were doing supersonic flow simulations and answering the assigned questions. He started getting really excited because this same constant kept coming up so he thought he was on to something. Turns out it was just 1/mach number. 


IN Undergrad, we found out that our Solar cooker's performance was off the charts. Turns out, those motherfucking thermocouples were not calibrated properly by our professor.
When I was in grad school we were doing plasma spectroscopy.  We were looking at very low pressure (For us that was ~1 torr) nitrogen helium plasma and found a ton of lines we had never seen before at higher pressures (~10 torr).  They were really interesting because they were narrow (implying a high mass) and opposite in phase to the cations we typically studied, implying a negative charge.  We were stumped till we searched the literature for heavy nitrogen anions and came across N5^- (a ring of 5 nitrogen atoms which was supposed to be aromatic meaning it would be resonance stabilized like benzene, so it would be particularity stable).  We searched more the spectral region and found the same spectra over and over which meant we were seeing the different vibrational bands.

This went on for a while but something didn't seem quite right.  The vibrational bands were way too far apart for a heavy molecule and what was predicted in the theorist's papers.  So I looked at the data for excited states of nitrogen and my heart sank. It was just an excited state transition of N2 molecules, seen decades ago. We learned some interesting things about how our system works at low pressures, but our ground breaking discovery was boring old nitrogen.
Not an experimentalist. Not a physicist. Not even a scientist. Ham radio operator here. Was building an antenna. Figuring out how much power the antenna could handle, I discovered a way to increase the power from 45 watts to 95 watts without adding in extra volt or amperage. I was justifiably excited. 

Obviously I did the math wrong. I didn't find a way to violate conservation of energy. 
I was dicking around in pre Calc and I found some wierd things. I found that there was a connection between the equation of a graph and the slope at points of the graph. I brought this new, shocking information to my teacher, who informed me that I had basically discovered the power rule. 
My examples have a pattern:

 * Witness something mind boggling in my setup or data

 * The thrilling rush ensues

 * I think about how i'll report this new wonder

 * Rational thought begins to seep back in

 * i'll even blush in realization of my folly

 * The relief that I didn't inform the media yet rolls in

 * And then I marvel at how rediculous the entire series of events was and probably will be in the future when I do it all again

Is this what is meant by " the thrill of discovery"?


I remember reading a story long ago about a professor trying to boil some liquid to test something.  
Thing is the liquid was some kind of petrol fuel.  
Tunnel vision testing? 
Certainly not a 'nobel' moment, but I did get excited about some results a bit too early on.  One of the projects I was working on in grad school was to measure stress-induced expansion of a slab of rock.  We built a fringe-locked interferometer with the rock slab as the test arm and put some PZTs on the rock.  After careful characterization of the interferometer and its transfer function, we modulated the PZTs and looked for the output signal from the interferometer to show expansion/contraction of the slab.  We definitely saw a signal in our data - and with the same period as the modulation signal.  At this point I was getting pretty excited, but the professor I was working with was skeptical, his exact words were "only the paranoid survive."  So we uncoupled all the PZTs from the slab and repeated the experiment and low and behold the interferometer output showed the same modulation as when they were attached.  We checked everything but never figured out exactly why it happened, it was some sort of parasitic coupling.  It wasn't a total loss though, the inerferometer had a displacement sensitivity of 0.5nm so at least we had an upper bound now.
In high school, my dad purchased one of those soda machine makers.  Several months later, I had an epiphany that I could make carbonated coffee.  

For the next 30 minutes, I was giddy with glee as I imagined all the glory, media press and deliciousness of my brilliant idea.  How could the world be so stupid not to conceive this prior to me?

Tastes like ass.  Reality did not match up to the dream.  I was humiliated by my hubris.
How about the multi-million dollar experiment to measure neutrinos that found neutrinos travelled faster than light, generating hundreds of papers, only to find out the [cable was loose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly).

Edit: to be clear, the scientists involved were very humble in their reportings and did nothing wrong.  It was the news media that went crazy :-)
The number of time I have measured over unity power balances... 
Cheating here, I'm a chemist. But I made a phosphorus complex once in undergrad I thought activated CO2 catalytically. Was already planning my nobel speech in my head when my supervisor explained the NMR splitting I saw was the wrong coupling constant and I was just seeing proton coupling.

Dang.
I did both theory and experiment in grad school. There was a 48 hour period where I thought I had solved the three body problem in quantum mechanical scattering theory. I didn't. I felt very puffed up for a couple days...
When I was in high school, I had this great idea that time might not be constant...I was certain that I would get the Nobel Prize some day for that. 

13 years later, my "A-ha!" moments from experiments have all been real, but nothing so big as to get the Nobel Prize.
I'm a biologist, not a physicist, but once I found this really bizarre invertebrate in one of my research aquariums.  It was in freshwater but looked absolutely nothing like anything I'd ever seen in freshwater.    Actually it looked vaguely closer to some marine inverts with no freshwater representatives. I popped it in some ethanol and went around trying to figure it out.

Turns out it was a free-living stage of a freshwater fish parasite, just one that I'd never seen before.
I had an Idea a ways back for a new, inexpensive method for additive manufacturing with conductive metals in a charged electrolyte bath, using a laser to excite small areas to stimulate growth.

Go figure, I got the polarity backwards in my head.  Never would have worked.
My first year as an undergrad physics major I was desperate to do research so I went to this professor who ignored me since I was a freshman and told to look into this "idea" without any direction or help from him,  he told me to try to find a lot of supporting data and use for it. Worked for it for my whole Spring Break. Turns out someone got the patent 4 months before for something similar to this idea. Professor dumped me because he thought I should've looked into that before gathering informations.
Good and cruel lesson.
Few years ago, in my undergrad years, there was a bit of excitement around the WMAP low multipole moments deviating from the cosmological models by some decent amount. (e.g. [here](http://faculty.washington.edu/jcramer/WMAP/WMAP_Multipoles.gif) )

One of the explanations that was floated was that there might be a non-trivial topology of the universe. In other words the Universe is made of cells and when you exit off the wall of one cell, you enter the same cell but from opposite direction. Like when you play snake, leave the screen on the right, and you enter on the left.

These cells could be cubes, dodecahedrons etc. For some reason I don't recall, the dodecahedron was likelier than others. I was given the task of checking quasar images from the sloan digital sky survey to see if they preferentially align in certain discrete angles. This is  what you'd expect, because through these cells, you see the quasar images rotated by the symmetry angle of the cell wall (e.g. 90 degrees for the cubes, 72 for the dodecahedrons, etc.).

I did a quick analysis using jpeg images of ~1000 quasars, stacked them together and low and behold, I get a star with 5 branches. That was one of the most exciting thing I've seen, it could have been the proof of the non-trivial topology of space. Because jpeg images are not top notch, I needed to confirm this using the astronomy standard format, and when I stacked the quasar images, the star shape didn't show up. I don't know the reason to this day, I'm guessing some jpeg compression method introduced the artifact.
Biologist here. I was working with dopaminergic neurons investigating the role of alpha synuclein (SNCA), after skimming some literature I noticed that SNCA is linked to attenuation of dopamine transporter and that dopamine metabolism results in reactive oxygen species; I thought I had just come up with the mechanism by which dopaminergic neurons die in Parkinson's disease, then I found out that this had been figured out 12 years ago. 
I think every kid who was interested in the subject invented a free energy device with magnets. It is those who persist into adults...
Measured a meissner effect in a room temperature lump of doped slag.  I was fantasizing about what kind of Hotel I would stay at in Stockholm when one of the lab techs pointed out to me that a permanent magnet from a prior experiment was taped under the apparatus.
During a project on anti nuclei production at the CDF I thought I had discovered anti tritium. 

No specific mistake just a pile of shit code
Thought I discovered a Trojan planet.  Was just an eclipsing binary.
I was helping someone from the other lab in our building once with some transmission measurements and she was consistently getting over-unity measurements. I kiddingly said it was Nobel material if she had some magical "gain medium battery" but she was very confident it was a fluke. I don't think she ever followed up, or saw that phenomenon again, for that matter.
Not really any part of my physics background, but shortly after learning about light field cameras, I realized that if you could create light field *projectors,* you could have 3d movies without a single focal depth; where you could focus anywhere in the scene.

I spent the next three hours drawing out an optical setup for some AR glasses for just this. Then I was like "hmm, I wonder if anyone has patented this yet" so I went out and looked for light field glasses. It was then that I learned about the Microsoft Hololens, which M$ had patented no more than a week before I came up with the idea. Their setup was significantly more developed than my own though, and they had already put together a processing architecture for the digital projection, so...there was no chance I could have competed with their patent had I gotten mine in first, lol. It probably wasn't even the first one either :\
The very first time you see a time-of-flight spectrum which looks like you might have particles moving FTL, for that *first* split second, you wonder a little bit, only to end up laughing at yourself immediately afterwards.
I was wondering why car manufacturer's didn't attach a dynamo to the axel of cars and use it to generate electricity, and then car's could run partially on electricity they generated. I invented the hybrid car engine after it had been invented.
Theorist here:

During the summer after my freshman year, I thought I discovered an energy conversion constant for high velocity scenarios, but it turned out to simply be a stupid alternative to using a gamma factor.
The Dover reprint is available new in paperback on Amazon for $17.21.  That's got to be cheaper than the cost of printing it out.  Why not give book reading a try?

At best, we might say that we don't know what happened before the big bang, which is not the same thing as saying that nothing existed. At worst, it might not even make sense to ask about "before the big bang", because our notion of time itself breaks down at the big bang.

Basically, we do not know what happened before the big bang, and we're not even sure whether the question is well-defined.
I would argue that this is just as unjustified as saying that something existed before the BB. We simply just don't know, our theories break down at the Planck era and we are not able to make any statements that are backed by our scientific knowledge. 
What do you mean by nothing?
There are problems. The big bang is considered the start of space-time, so there's no 'before' if time didn't exist, and there's no 'nothing' if space didn't exist. Literally not even nothing.

My concept entirely breaks down on that. I can't conceive of it, but that's what I think the Big Bang means: the start of space-time. Therefore, not even nothing, not even time. "Before the Big Bang," like "dividing by zero," is undefined.
Personally, I think it would be incorrect or premature to definitely state that nothing existed before the big bang. We can't yet say this. 

------------------------

FOR EXAMPLE... 

There are some who believe the current Universe is infinite in size, and that our big bang was just a "local inflation event" within that greater infinite spanning Universe. 

That means a lot of stuff has happened before our little inflation event. (An infinity of time/events has happened before us!)

------------------------

Or in ANOTHER EXAMPLE: 

Some say that our big bang, created our isolated "little" Universe bubble, within a vast sea known as the "multi-verse" that is seething constantly with other bubble universes popping in and out of existence constantly.

If so, then it's possible the fabric of the greater multi-verse has it's own isolated space-time dimensions, that are separate from our own bubble-universe's space-time dimensions. 

--------------------------------

STILL OTHERS... say that our current observable Universe is the "bottom" or the "interior" of a black hole, and that the "big bang" was the moment the black hole was created. 

This means there is now a wall, isolating us from the rest of the Universe (since we can't see outside the event horizon of the black hole that we are stuck inside of). 

If true, that thus means we have our own space-time, and the main part of the universe has it's own space-time unfolding. That makes us a kind of branching space-time, moving in a different direction from the main space-time. 

###If you accept the big bang theory... 

...then there is no such moment.  If this is the case, then the correctness of your sentence devolves into logical trickery.  

*Skip to the next section if you don't care about logical trickery*.  

"Before the big bang" refers to a moment which may or may not exist.  Bertrand Russel deals with this sort of thing in his analysis of definite descriptions, which goes more or less like this:

Under the big bang theory, the same analysis applies to your sentence, which I think makes it irrelevant for /r/physics at any rate.

### If you reject the big bang theory...

...then you might admit that yes--there was a bang, but no--it wasn't the BIG one.  You still might use the phrase "the big bang" to refer to that event, but you would be doing so in a way that does not assert the validity of the theory.  In this case, I see two ways to go: 

- We could adopt a theory of time that does not have a beginning, in which case I guess the existence of objects before the big bang remains an open question for the astronomers to settle.

- We could adopt a theory of time that does have a beginning, but for which the bang in question was not that beginning.  In this case, I think your assertion would be incorrect.  If the big bang happened *in* time, then at the very least, time itself existed before the big bang.
Nothing exists now. 
TL;DR. No information about what happened before the big bang survived the event.
It's a difficult topic to discuss, as it really doesn't make sense.

Time is a dimension of our universe. "Before" the big bang, time itself did not exist, therefore there never actually was a "before" the big bang.

If we want to consider a sort of transuniversal time (honestly just talking out of my ass at this point, and I wouldn't want you to think otherwise), then I suppose we could consider there to be a "before" the big bang, where given our current knowledge we would suspect to observe a singularity. Again though, this is just spouting out of my ass and really doesn't even make much sense. There wouldn't be "nothing" exactly, as we know that there are things now, so there at the very least would have to be the potential for our current reality to exist.
The Big Bang is a ridiculous theory in my opinion. Why? Because as my imagination works backwards towards the beginning everything becomes denser. Eventually the density of the whole universal system approaches the density of a black hole before it approaches the density of the supposed pre expansion universe of planck sized units. No! At the point of black hole density there are no positive time values left in the system so time can never progress forward. So how does the math progress the system past the black hole density into the positive time values we see today?
We don't know. I'm not even sure this is a valid question. Time started with the big bang so can there be a 'before'?
Cant state anything at all, maybe your right but you can also be wrong. 
Before implies that time continued to exist but the Big Bang was the the beginning of time so there was no "before" the beginning of time.
All the math
Don't forget about numerical methods though!
I would say a decent grounding in group theory is essential for understanding most of particle physics.
You don't need PhD in math for doing *some* work in Physics, but it certainly helps if you want to publish and be a *top dog*

For more info - you can read about people who helped Einstein with math. 
So you want to have your eighth graders tackle engineering problems that top tier robotics companies are working on right now?  How much do they know about battery chemistry?  How much have they studied aerodynamics or control systems?

I like the general sentiment of the project, but these days you can make two sticks tied together into a drone using modern hobbyist components.  I'd suggest rethinking the project.
There have been scattering experiments with electrons that reveal there must be some kind of sub structure in protons and neutrons

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_inelastic_scattering


First, we have observed bare quarks. Top quarks are so unstable that after they are produced, they decay before they bind up with other quarks, so every time we observe a top quark decay, we observe a bare quark.

Second, there are other ways to see that a proton is a composite particle than to break it apart into 3 quarks (which is impossible). Probably the easiest one to understand is that there are patterns in the properties of mesons and baryons. Mesons are particles made of a quark and antiquark pair. Baryons are particles made of three quarks. The patterns are analogous to the patterns of the periodic table of elements. 

In the periodic table, these patterns are explained by saying that atoms are made of sub-particles, and that patterns in the arrangement of sub-particles manifest as patterns in the properties of elements. Likewise, patterns in the arrangement of quarks manifest as patterns in the properties of mesons and baryons.
Very simply put, if a proton has a substructure of charged particles, certain collision experiments that involve elementary particle interactions predict different outcomes than if it had no substructure. This has been measured.
QCD (the theory that describes quarks and gluons) correctly describes things like nuclear decays and the strong force in general . so the fact that we can make conclusions from this model and test its validity by observing its consequences is evidence that there's something to it.  whether it's "real"  or not, doesn't matter for physics.  for physics it only matters that it accurately models reality. 

 i haven't done the math but i think your theory that they are "just indivisable particles"  doesn't model radioactive decays well. 
What does "real" mean?  Until you work that part out, you've got some shifting goalposts in your question about the nature of quarks.

It is pretty conclusively demonstrated that protons and neutrons are not 'simple particles'.  For example, the neutron has a magnetic moment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_magnetic_moment), and lots of experiments smashing protons and neutrons together have produced interesting results.
This story was all over the news a few years ago. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay#Changing_decay_rates) mentions it with these references:

* Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0205v1.pdf
* Refutation: http://donuts.berkeley.edu/papers/EarthSun.pdf

The solar neutrino hypothesis is apparently debunked, including by analysis of nuclear decay in thermoelectric generators outside of Earth orbit.

But there are actually nuclear decay processes, such as electron capture, where the rate is affected by environmental factors. This stands high on my [list of things I didn't learn in school which really shocked me years later](http://www.pabr.org/scifactoids/scifactoids.en.html#half_life).

> If this apparent relationship between flares and decay rates proves true, it could lead to a method of predicting solar flares prior to their occurrence

No such prediction happened. Obvious case: The scientists don't understand their experiments.

While neutrinos can induce beta decays, the rate is usually negligible, and solar flares have nothing to do with neutrinos.
I guess that are saying neutrinos are influencing decay rates in a measurable way. It all depends how much.
Well I've heard of *superradiance* (power law decay rather than exponential). Not sure if that relates to this article.
Every Jackson problem. 
I forget what the question was, but for a take home final in Fourier Analysis, the professor assigned an incredibly difficult proof.  I thought I had the solution, but then realized I made an error and the solution wasn't valid.  I kept trying to solve it, but attempt after attempt led nowhere.  The other student fared similarly, and not even one student in the class managed to solve the problem.   

Since we had a take home final, instead of an actual final we had a final lecture on which we would turn in the take home final and the professor would go over the solutions.   We all turn it in and ask him how to do the problem.   He starts copying his solutions, doing it in the same way most of us had, gets to the point where we had made the mistake.  He then starts to make the same mistake but catches himself.  He then stares at it for a while longer before apologizing and saying that it he didn't even know if it was possible to prove.  

Tl;dr: professor accidentally assigned a problem which might not even have had a solution.  
A sphere with a hollow cavity where the outside surface is at one temperature and the inside surface has two hemispheres each at different temperatures. Find the temperature everywhere in the shell.
A Taylor expansion, not sure what function it was. I spend days on it, using every mathematical tool I had learnt, after a week of daily struggle I manage to solve it just in time for the homework deadline.

I hand in around ten pages of homework, five being a derivation of the coefficients in closed form. I ask my tutor whether I missed something obvious, this problem was so much harder than all the other ones in the problem set. 

 > You know you only needed to calculate the first two coefficients right?
Well I'd suggest to look at the Faraday effect  (Faraday rotation), but it is a known phenomenon and apparently they are wanting new research. What, do they expect you to get a Nobel Prize too? I assume you've talked about all this with your physics teacher as well? They should be able to point you in some interesting directions. Or connect you with professors at a local university.
How does temperature affect the i-v curve of a diode?
Your first couple years will be mostly general ed courses, math sequences (calculus), and intro physics. Take this time to get into good study habits and build a nice GPA. Read your physics professors webpages and find things that interest you. Reach out to them to see if there is anything you can do as an undergrad researcher. This facetime is important when the time comes for letters of recommendation. 

I'd also consider taking some courses in programming (that is, from the computer science dept), electrical engineering, etc to help get some skills that can help you land a first job (and help in the lab!). Also if you can involved in engineering projects (solar car, etc) that will get you some project experience. Careers with just a BS in physics are challenging to find because they will often be competing with engineers.

If you want to work in physics, a PhD is basically a requirement. But you can be in academia (open positions are sparse) or industry.
Do you wish to go into physics, for the pure joy and love of physics itself, in which you find yourself often obsessively thinking about physics problems in your head?

If so, then CERTAINLY: majoring in physics is probably for you! 

But you'll probably have to reach the PhD level to make a good career of it. 

And in reaching the PhD level... ideally and realistically, your measured IQ would probably have to be well above average. (But it doesn't have to be sky-high, and super genius level IQ isn't necessary to succeed in physics!)

--------------------------------

There are however some occupations related to physics, in which you don't have to reach the PhD level. 

Such as... science journalist. I also know someone who helps design sports-medicine related devices and implants, and he did his Bachelor's in Physics. 

So I'm sure there are other people making a living with "only" a Bachelor's/Master's in Physics, in a field that is related to physics. 

If you do some googling you'll probably be able to find them, to get ideas. 

--------------------------------

Finally, if you want to major in physics simply because you want to work in fields related to the sciences... then another option is a degree in Computer Science. 

I've heard that many physics-research teams are desperate for computer experts to help them program/design simulations, or advanced database analysis of extensive amounts of experimental data etc... 

Just a Bachelor's in Computer Science is often enough to get you working with those scientific research teams. 

And if you want to major in physics, because you want to be an Astronaut, then there are also other alternative pathways to that career to explore as well, related to engineering and medicine, if those fields interest you more.

--------------------------------

But yes, if it's just the pure joy of physics you love and obsess about, then you'll likely have the motivation to go all the way to the PhD level, and do well. 

European here so it might be different in the US but: 
expect it to be a lot more mathematical than in high school, we barely touched integrals in high school and suddenly differentiation and integration is everywhere, even in the simplest dynamics problems. But once you get used to using calculus, you will be amazed how simple stuff gets.(i remember in high school we had all those equations for speed, acceleration,... that you had to know by heart, and like two months into university it was like wait, i can just derive all that stuff using calculus and F=ma, sweet!)

All together, for me a big part of transition from high school to uni was changing the way you approach a problem, from here is a problem, what equation can i use and plug in the numbers, to (mostly first year mechanics, dynamics) what is the simplest way to take a problem apart to smallest possible pieces and solve it generaly. 
Math. Lots of math. You're going to feel like you're in a math course that just has a physics theme to it. Once you have finished your degree, you will be better at math than most of the math majors.

It's also going to be difficult. Partly because you're going from high school to college, which is already a rough transition for a lot of people. And partly because physics is *different* from most other subjects which creates a steep learning curve early on. And partly because intro physics covers a lot of different topics, from motion to circuits to heat transfer to moments of inertia. In that way, Intro physics is actually more difficult than higher level classes where you get to focus on one fundamental concept the entire semester.
Use the first few years to get really good at physics and math, until solving novel problems comes easily to you. Sit in the front of class and make eye contact with the professor and use their office hours. Join clubs, build things with the clubs, work on projects on your own time. Use your projects and your letters of recc to get into internships or labs. Get really good grades. If you do these things you can get a career in Physics (hopefully) but it likely won't be similar to what you expect right now. Just don't expect to get a degree and instantly have good prospects.
Just about to finish my first semester, only the exams to go. Physics class is mainly solving problems. Make sure you are comfortable with your algebra and work on your calculus and you should be covered! Best advice I can give from my current stage (albeit not a deep one) is to solve problems, and lots of them. Grab a textbook and dive in! Hope this helps.

[Four Gravitons](https://4gravitons.wordpress.com/) is also awesome for theoretical stuff; he's an amplitudologist.

[Of Particular Significance](https://profmattstrassler.com/) is great, focusing on phenomenology.

John Baez's blog, [Visual Insight](http://blogs.ams.org/visualinsight/). While mostly pure math, much of it is relevant for physics, and all of it's really interesting.

If you are looking for a general science blog I can recommend my personal favorite is [Almost Looks Like Work](https://jasmcole.com).
It is a mixture of statistics and physics.
I used to read this one a lot, haven't in a while: http://condensedconcepts.blogspot.com

Also this one, but she hasn't posted in a while:

The idea behind pulsar navigation has been around for quite a while, and is supposedly very accurate (within 5 km, anywhere in the solar system, and hypothetically just as accurate beyond that).

The actual concept is fundamentally identical to lighthouses:  You see a reference pulsar flashing at a certain rate, check your database to identify which one it is, repeat, and based on the angles to multiple reference stars, you can nail down your approximate location.  Pulsars are great for this because while "normal" stars can be extremely similar, the chance of two pulsars having identical spin rates is effectively 0, and counting how fast something flashes is way easier than doing a thorough measurement on things like magnitude or metallicity.

Significant victory?  Probably not.  China hasn't put anything up that has required that kind of deep space location accuracy yet (accuracy from Earth-based positioning is within about 4km per AU distant), and NASA is planning on doing a similar experiment using the NICER instrument they are launching to the ISS in the next year or two (CRS-11 resupply mission, whenever that comes around).

Edit:  clarification on the pulsar timing:  They measure the pulse rate of a known pulsar, compare to a "fixed" database (Earth), and can then calculate position from multiple reference stars based on the slight change in timing, like GPS or earthquakes.
If you'd like to read an in depth paper on how navigating with pulsars is done, here is one: https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4842 



In case anyone else wondered where the Long March was aiming to put the satillite, [this spaceflight101.com article](http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-11-launches-xpnav-1-satellite/) mentions the satellite went into a sun synchronous orbit for its mission.

The article is also a quick intro into the Long March launch system.
The whole concept of countries "beating" each other in a "race" implies both lose.  If we helped each other we'd go twice as far. Stupid humanity keeps holding itself back.
Virgo will give a huge effective sensitivity boost. It was planned to start end of 2016 a while ago, but that shifted to 2017 and I didn't see a recent update unfortunately.
Nobody knows I suppose. Pity. 
I don't see too many of these posts and notice them maybe 1/day or so. I agree it distracts from serious conversations about cutting edge work, but sometimes I pick up good information about fields I am not currently involved in. Additionally, new pedagogical literature may be worth noting and so it might be good to have the reference in this sub. I'm no mod here but it's just my 2c. 
Banning those questions won't make more physics discussion appear
We're really not at the point where there are so many posts that we need to curtail the slightly repetitive ones, but I encourage you to post physics-related links that you find interesting so that the question threads won't seem as prominent.
Maybe we should categorize them instead. I dont see a problem
Weekly thread?

Weekly what to read thread?
I agree these can be annoying, especially as we mostly get the same questions over and over again. But i think as long as they're the minority we should let some of them slide. Its an invaluable resource for laymen/prospective students. Try and imagine yourself in their positions. 
Yeah I don't see it as a problem, especially because like me many people feel lost and overwhelmed by the enormous scope of physics careers. As long as it's not too many I don't see it as an issue, considering how helpful it is to people like me who need to reach out to professionals
That's amazing. I always assumed the cilia was used for movement only. 
Yes. A hole can be treated like a particle, just with positive charge---this is similar to positrons in particle physics which can be interpreted as holes in the Dirac sea. The mass will be the negative of the band mass of the valence band (so it's positive).
Can you clarify what you mean by hole?
I've been self-studying Quantum Mechanics at the graduate level using Shankar's Principles of Quantum Mechanics and it's simply the perfect book for self study having only undergrad QM background. Would highly recommend.
I just finished school and I have 1 year of free time before going to university, studying physics, what books would you recommend to prepare for University?
As an undergrad who has taken physics 1 and 2 type classes, what resources do you recommend for relearning everything in those two classes? I had a really bad start in both of them, especially with vectors and Newton's second law. I am moving onto intermediate physics next semester and although it uses calculus, I want to be able to go into the class with confidence and not be afraid of needing to go back to prior knowledge. Any text books, or websites that could mainly teach me Newton's seconds law, vectors, forces, electric currents, and magnetism that you guys recommend?
Best GR textbook for the advanced undergrad level? I have taken PDEs and Linear, as well as all the core physics classes. I've looked into Sean Carroll's book and Bernard Schutz's text, but don't know which is best for me.

EDIT: I'm doing this as an ind. study since the only astronomy professor at my school is on sabbatical 
I'm currently working towards my doctorate in mathematics. Knowing very little about physics (only basic newtonian and electrodynamics) I'm looking for some textbooks geared towards mathematicians to study in my free time. That being said, Spivak's Physics for Mathematicians seems enticing. Can anyone give me any insights into the book or recommend some others?
Does anyone have any suggestions on what would be a logical sequence of topics (and books) to study to get from undergraduate quantum mechanics to advanced topics in quantum mechanics like QED and QFT. (I'm also doing a math degree and have a lot of exposure to linear algebra and Geometry.)

The class I took covered the first five chapters of Griffiths QM, should I just progress from there into perturbation theory (the following chapter)? is that necessary for Relativistic QM?
So you're a highschool student right now? If you are wondering if you're lacking the math knowledge for physics, then pick a standard physics textbook (anything with "introduction to ..." should do) and go through the first couple chapters. Are you finding the derivations confusing and the applied math makes no sense? Then you probably need to keep on working on your math. 

It's something I do whenever I'm wondering if I'm ready to tackle something new. I don't know if it's the most effective way, but works for me. 
I would try and learn calculus through Khan Academy videos and free textbooks. Use calculus in doing basic mechanics problems (can you integrate any acceleration function to get a velocity function? can you integrate to find the rotational inertia of weird objects? can you integrate Newton's law of cooling to get temperature as function of time?). If you can do mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermo problems with calculus as a highschooler without proper schooling then that is impressive. I have a lot more schooling than you (I'm a sophomore in college) and I can't do the math in theoretical Physics books.
Is... Is this real? Did someone do this to solve an actual problem?
I'm amazed by the kind of stuff that gets implemented sincerely in Excel

One of my first upper-division physics labs involved creating a 2-D Poisson solver for electrostatics in Excel. As a platform for executing two-dimensional rectangular grid solvers, it's very user-friendly. 
News just in: *All CAS now obsolete. Bow before the glorious power of Excel.*

I.. I. How the fuck do I only have one paper published? I could easily publish one paper every two days  if this counts as something worth publishing.
Relevant xkcd: http://xkcd.com/1667 
My high school physics teacher had us naively solve differential equations using Excel.

When I say naively, I mean not really solving but kind of simulating something almost similar.

We'd create a room with cooling elements on the sides at fixed temperatures. The cells inside the room would have their temperature determined by the cells around it. Then you could use the time step function in Excel to let it "evolve".

Then we added doors and saw how that would heat up the room etc.

Not actually solving the equations but still kind of cool.
I just want to see some figures, and the spreadsheet.
What interests me about this is what specific use he made of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code and whether or not he needed to use calls to external DLLs written for example in C or C++.  This app is undoubtedly not just using the built-in Excel functions or Solver feature.  I couldn't find anything about that at the IEEE link, though, and not about to pay up for a curiosity question.

Though Excel is apparently up-to-the-job, a big downside is it's Windows-dependent.  If you're going to do custom programming, why not do it using a more platform-versatile tool?

I'm a programmer and even I sometimes do data manipulation in excell just because of how easy it is to rearrange columns
While earning my EE degree at Arizona State in 2001, my electromagnetics professor, Mr Dias, accomplished this.  It then became a homework assignment for us to generate plots in excel for different physical configurations.  All satisfying Maxwell's equations...
Hard to say, because it's not clear exactly what your background is. Studying special relativity implies you've already learned the basics of classical mechanics (kinematics, Newton's Laws, momentum conservation type stuff). If that's true, the next step traditionally is to learn some electromagnetism and the physics of waves.

In general, you can look up your local university's astrophysics program and follow their track.
Can I guess who your favorite musician is? Is it Brian May?

Anyways, astrophysics is a pretty high-level field. If nothing else, you're going to need to know a lot of math if you want to study it beyond what the layman can understand.

But starting out, I'd recommend Stephen Hawking's series such as *A Brief History of Time*.
If you don't want to go back to a university and just want to do it on your own, you could always go for MIT open courseware. All of their classes that are offered at the school are online there, lectures included. After just checking they have graduate and undergraduate courses. Check on their website and find out what you are required to take at MIT for the astrophysics major then go through all of it on their website. 

Ocw.mit.edu is the website I believe. Lots of free resources too. 
You could try this: http://oyc.yale.edu/astronomy/astr-160

It doesn't use much math. 

I didn't study astrophysics myself, but in general in physics it's really important to do problems. Yale also has a basic physics course with problem sets (same website as the one I linked to), however it's much more mathematically involved. If you really want to go deep, you need college level calculus and linear algebra. MIT open courseware has courses for both.

You can check out Cosmic Perspective as text book. I stumbled upon it last year when i was searching for Fundementals of Physics ay my university library. Both text books cover basics and they do very good job. Books are very thick but most of it is text based and you can almost read through them like novels, they are are that well–written.
Hey, it's really great to see your interest and passion for astro-physics!

I've had a strong interest in science, astronomy, and all things space related since I was a kid (especially after my Dad had taken me to see the first launch of the Space Shuttle in 1981!).

--------------------------------

But ya, one source you may greatly enjoy, to get up to speed on many astronomy, and astrophysics related topics, is the podcast called: 

[AstronomyCast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHI67dh9jEO2rvK--MdCSg). 

It's hosted by Dr. Pamela. She has a PhD in Astronomy, and has done extensive research with many of the world's great telescopes, and she's also awesome at explaining complex fundamental topics in an easy to understand way. 

The earlier shows discuss the most fundamental topics. So you can always do a mix of watching the most recent show, while also working your way from the first show, forward, gradually. 

--------------------------------

Astronomy Cast is also co-hosted by Fraser Cain, and he has another amazing show called the [Weekly Space Hangout](https://www.youtube.com/user/universetoday), that you can watch on his channel.

The Weekly Space Hangout will often interview NASA astronomers, and then after the interview him and the other cohosts (who include PhD level students in astronomy and astrophysics) will often discuss the week's most exciting astronomy news, etc... 

Sometimes the interviews can get a little bit boring... So sometimes I skip ahead through the interview to the space-news discussion part of the show, which is my favorite part! 

I found this one and i haven't started it yet but i've heard its a good one and i'm looking forward to start it as soon as i get time to do so. https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ANUx+ANU-ASTRO4x+2T2016/courseware/243bc32161ff4d8fbf8da0fcfa46b8ec/8932911d17f148e0a69fc81f2d4852d4/ someone gave me this https://www.khanacademy.org/ for math support also. Hope i helped
If you're interested in cosmology, I would check out Barbara Ryden's  Introduction to Cosmology. It's written at a very accessible level and doesn't assume any more background than fundamental physics and math. Includes some very nice and intuitive descriptions of physical phenomena, and explains the background behind every discovery. 
Recommendation #1: don't think about who reads it. If you do, you'll never get anywhere with the project. Actually, one of the very good uses of a blog is recording things that _you_ find useful, for future reference.

Recommendation #2: make sure you can include math, probably by incorporating MathJax into the site. There are MathJax plugins for some of the big blogging services, including Wordpress.

After considering that... just sign up somewhere and start writing.
It's up to you to decide who you intend your audience to be. And your audience could even be just yourself. Why do you want to do it? 

For where, a number of places offer it, but google blogs seems pretty easy.
Just do it. If you give up halfway you lose nothing. If you want readers PM me and you'll get one.
I myself am also in my fourth year, and have started to toy with the same idea. A motivation from my side was to use it as a tool in my career. So when I go looking for my PhD I could supply the link as a part of my CV.

What I would like to know (if there are any professors in this forum, selecting among PhD candidates) is wether you would even look at a potential PhD's website? Or would I just be wasting my time writing and blogging about what I happen to find interesting?
Don't have any advice for you, but I would definitely be interested in reading something like this.

[The Physics Classroom](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/) is specifically aimed at high school students.

OpenStax in association with Rice University has a free [College Physics for AP Courses](https://openstax.org/details/books/college-physics-ap-courses) online textbook with PDF download available.

And of course there's the [Feynman lectures online](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)
[The Feynman Lectures](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) are a perfect introduction to physics from high school level all the way up to degree level. 

A good understanding of maths is essential to more advanced physics and there is an excellent textbook written by two extremely qualified headmaster's called [The Language Of Physics: A Foundation for University Study](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0199533806/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is what's recommended to first year University students and poses questions at the end of each chapter. 

If you're looking for something a little less intimidating, then the A Very Short Introduction series have a perfect range of short (and cheap!) books on Physics: [Quantum Theory]

These are great little books that don't blow your head off!

Physics is an extremely interesting subject to read around and I wish you the best with it :)
This is a lot like complaints about democracy as a governmental system.  As Churchill said:

>Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government EXCEPT for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.

Pointing out the fact that a system has flaws is not the same as providing a better solution.  Before the days of metrics, I'd imagine science funding was largely determined by who you knew/who your friends were.  After all, if you read the bios of any big physicist (Feynman, Anderson, Weinberg, whoever), it's always like: "I called this buddy of mine and he got me a position at blah, blah, blah".  That's a pretty terrible way to distribute finite resources.

As long as hiring and tenure are tied to fame and metrics, researchers will likely adjust their behavior to meet these standards. Which brave university will start hiring and promoting blindly? Any takers?

Edit: damn you auto-correct
If research is publicly funded, then publication blackouts should be cancelled, and publicly available, free publication should be mandated alongside any commercial publication.
You need to take so much physics and math to take a legitimate quantum mechanics course that you basically need to be a physics major (at least classical mechanics and waves in physics, and at least calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations in math; most programs will require you to take electromagnetism as well). 

I am convinced that anyone smart enough to figure out how to use reddit independently is smart enough to manage an undergraduate major in physics, if they're willing to bleed and cry for it. The most important requirement is the desire to learn it, because it's hard. Physics deserves its reputation as one of the most life-consuming majors, so you need to enjoy the physics, or you'll hate your life. (Edit: Intro physics can be kinda boring, and it isn't very representative of what higher level physics is like. Don't give up on physics just because calculating the acceleration of blocks on wedges is dull. It is, we know, but you need to do it to get an intuitive sense of basic physics. It builds your basic physics muscles.)

If you are satisfied with a hand-wavy, qualitative course, most larger universities will offer a "physics for politicians" or "survey of physics concepts" or something like that, but you won't really learn the meat of quantum mechanics in those courses.

Sometimes the chemistry department will offer an in-between course, that sorta kinda has some of the math involved, but isn't nearly as rigorous or deep as an actual physics course. That still would require you to be a chem major/minor, though.

Oh, right, and how do you start:

1) Take calculus if your high school offers it. Go as deep in math as you can.

2) Take AP physics if your high school offers it. Go as deep in physics as you can.

3) Enroll in linear algebra ASAP in university, and get started on the intro physics for majors track.

At this point, you're on the track to QM, and it will happen eventually.
If you google "Griffiths Quantum Mechanics" you'll quickly find a pdf of the most commonly used textbook for college QM classes. However, you'll quickly find that you can't just read through it and understand anything without taking a few more years of math.

So the question is: Are you looking for a quick way to just learn some QM for the layman, or are you thinking of actually studying physics in college?
I don't know what background is, but you'll need to know a fair amount of mathematics to really learn about quantum mechanics. Partial differential equations, linear algebra, multi-variable calculus. There's infinite dimensional matrices and all sorts of weird stuff. That being said, I love quantum. It's really quite amazing - the more you learn, you see how the whole structure fits together wonderfully. If you're an engineer, you'll probably be taking a lot of these math courses anyway.

On the other hand, if that doesn't sound too appealing to you, your college may offer lower lever introductions to the subject. A course in quantum mechanics isn't automatically hard - just be careful, because it may be a lot of  math either way.
As others have said, you really don't want to learn QM unless you actually intend to be a physicist.  A course in QM is not about discussing thought experiments of cats and entanglement, it is a dense, math heavy slog where you calculate energy levels of hydrogen atoms and energy level splitting due to weak magnetic fields, etc.  QM classes are about using the mathematical machinery of QM to calculate experimentally detectable quantities.  They're nothing like a popular science treatment on the subject.
Im a physics student in my second year and I haven't had a course about it yet, BUT I have heard from a friend that (at university level) you won't understand a lot. You just get used to it. Apparently you also need a pretty good understanding of linear algebra.

Therefore I would not do it without any prior education in physics. 
you'll need a bit of background and work your way up slowly. it's not like you can attend any lecture and immediately understand everything. to be honest the stuff that you do in a quantum mechanics lecture is not immediately clear even for people that have been studying for about 1.5 years at that point. even students are constantly struggling with it. 
You could find a modern physics textbook; often they cover relativity first, but they should cover basic quantum mechanic principles (as well as the background that founded quantum mechanics). Personally I would suggest this route before picking up a quantum mechanics textbook--to do it formally does require a good range of mathematics that you should be exposed first.
Grab a griffiths introduction to quantum mechanics book, open it up and start reading and don't stop reading for 8 hours straight. 

If you're still enjoying yourself, imagine doing that every single night for a year. That should give you a good idea of what you're in for. 
There are some good lectures available on youtube.  Susskind is popular.

From what I recall you really only need to know multivariable calculus,  particularly partial differentiation. Besides that, good physical intuition and lots of algebra.
The calculus series, and a *teensy touch* of ODE experience would be useful probably.  The bigger thing with Thermodynamics is having intuition about physical systems.  Concepts dominate the subject. 
Even the third derivative ("jerk") doesn't get much attention. If you've tried to look it up I assume you saw people talking about how it's relevant to things like roller coaster and vehicle safety, but I think even that is only true in a sort of silly way. 

The human body can withstand a fair amount of force if it's properly prepared: you get into a safe position, tense your muscles, and so forth. Some of that process is conscious, but even the most absent-minded person will instinctively adjust a bit to protect against a force if they feel the force starting. But if the force starts up very suddenly, and especially if you didn't have any prior warning, you might get whiplash from a fairly weak force.

So, what you want is a way to measure how fast a force starts up. Acceleration is proportional to net force, so the rate of change of acceleration, jerk, is proportional to the rate of change of force, and makes a decent metric for this sort of thing. But none of this is really coming from deep physical principles; in fact it's pretty specific to systems that need to react to a force in a timely fashion: living things and maybe some unusually sophisticated robots. 
In a college physics classroom setting? No.

Source: I'm a physics grad.
Not really. Derivatives higher than 2 aren't very meaningful in physics in general.

For position/velocity/acceleration specifically, I think this can be traced to kinetic energy going like velocity (squared), while potential energy usually depends only on position. As you go higher in physics, you will learn that the equations of motion can be extracted from derivatives of energy, so only second derivatives and lower tend to show up.
I've studied physics for quite a while (I have a Masters in Physics) and I hadn't even heard of Jerk/Jounce/pop/lock/drop until a couple of weeks ago when I was curious about it.

So I'd say no, you're likely to never see it unless you have a particularly quirky professor.
I know in either strings or temperature wave forms you use the first position derivative to graph them, but with solid structures such as steel beams you use the fourth derivative of position. This is essentially because the beam is too rigid to have much of a change in position or velocity, so you have to look deep into its derivatives to find out what's going on with it.

Another thing, in many mathematics the integral of an equation is impossible to find. Thus, to approximate its integral, you end up using as many derivatives of the function as you can to make the approximated graph as close to the real graph as possible. This is seen in any infinite sum (calculus II or BC stuff).
Just a quick off-the-cuff response from my phone (without taking a detailed look at your code): The most common cause of instability in leap frog methods is using too large of a time step. Higher order methods compensate for this by estimating the error at each time step.
Sometimes, yes!  Take a look at the Jahn-Teller effect, for example.  Sometimes you have a degeneracy in one of the one-electron states that arises because of the symmetry (e.g. pairing of the d(z^2) and d( x^2 + y^2 ) orbitals of a transition metal complex with octahedral symmetry in an E_g irreducible representation).  If there are multiple ways to arrange the electrons in these states (like if you had one electron in a pair of orbitals), then it's often possible to lower the energy of the structure by breaking the symmetry to a subgroup of the point/space group.  Then the energy level of the degenerate electron is lowered as the states split apart, and the entire structure is stabilized.

TL;DR - yes, sometimes, if the structures are related and you consider not just the symmetry but also the effects of symmetry breaking.
With Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy you have a resolution of sub-atomic scales which allows you to directly measure it. 

Historically people used the fact that waves in the lattice need to fit between the atoms, so measuring their wavelength or energy allows you to calculate the lattice distance. 
As /u/verfmeer said, with modern techniques like Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM):

http://www.unisoku.com/img/RGHs2000-L1.jpg

And Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (STM):

http://wordpress.mrreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ibm-stm-604x265.jpg

You can now image (and even place) individual atoms.

However, before that and to this day the main technique to determine the general periodic arrangement of atoms and their spacing is X-ray cystallography (XRD), which we've been able to do for over a century.  However, it doesn't give it in such a direct way.  Here's an X-ray crystallography image:

https://askabiologist.asu.edu/sites/default/files/resources/articles/crystal_clear/CuZn_SOD_C2_x-ray_diffraction_250.jpg

It actually gives the information in what is called "recipricol space".  This means it takes a bit of reverse engineering to figure out what the actual spatial structure is.  That's what, for example, Watson and Crick are so famous for (determining that DNA has a double helix structure).  People had X-ray crystallography data of DNA but it wasn't obvious what the base structure was such that it would produce such data.
Just wondering if anyone here works or has worked for the Canadian Space Agency. Currently in my undergrad and planning on at least a masters in astrophysics/astronomy. I'd like to know what its like to work there and how hard it would be to get a job there.
How much would my resume for grad school be boosted by graduating with a MA in Mathematics in addition to a BS in physics?
Q: Physics graduates with ONLY bachelor's degrees: what do you do now?
reason for Q: am semi-recent physics grad working at a call center.
Undergrad here. When should I start seriously thinking about what to specialize in (or if I even want to continue on to grad school). When did you decide and what inspired the decision? 
Already have physics declared as a major, and I know I want to double it with something but I'm not sure with what. Was originally going to go for astronomy but I don't want to force myself in a corner of doing that forever - kinda wanna keep my options more open. Also considering computer science or math. Thoughts on the choice? Should I try for a minor in one of the ones I don't go with?
Like ShareLatex?
Zotero is pretty cool
dropbox is widely used in the physics community. Point dropbox towards your project files and viola, they are synced on all partitions, computers, etc.
not necessarily an endorsement, but almost all faculty I know uses dropbox for this.
If you continue to do physics in the future, discrete integration will serve you a lot. Prof Barba made a cool course on the subject, using the ex of Navier Stokes equations (http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/) but you could also try to implement a strengh of materials solver and use it to solve a problem you can compare with an experiment (like the bending of a pencil as an ex). This will make you familiar with intertia matrixes and all you can do with them, aswell. One of the things i liked the most to do was implementing raytracing code. It's not taht simple, but has a very satisfying result, and feels like "professionnal" code to write and run (hello endless runtimes !). You may finally want to have a look at the python code posted in /r/physics that implements n-body gravity (http://cyber-omelette.blogspot.fr/2016/11/python-n-body-orbital-simulation.html).

Another idea is to help dev code for videogame mods you like, there's always tons of work you can do even at a more basic level.
If you have done a box with particles then I would actually continue on with that to introduce yourself to analysis. 

Can you get the mean squared displacement of the particles? Can you put them in a box with a exit hole? Sometimes just playing with your own systems is the best way to learn the next extension of your code. 
Two projects come to mind:

--Simulating an Ising model (set of paramagnets that are pointing up or down) using the Monte Carlo method (may be a large DYI project but a lot of useful things to learn).
--Simulating a harmonic oscillator system starting from a differential equation, then add a driving force and/or dampening force


I would do some QM modelling, plotting wavefunctions of different potentials and different numbers of dimensions. It'll help massively with your QM intuition, and mathematical and programming skills and it'll also be cool. There's also a load of similar stuff online you can use for inspiration/confirmation.
A bit different than the other suggestions, but you may want to take a look at contributing to some open source scientific libraries (such as [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)) or doing a general programming project rather than working on something physics-specific. As someone who does a good bit of programming both in and out of physics, the code of most physicists and scientists in general is pretty awful as far as structure and organization. Learning a bit of typical comp sci stuff can really help out when you want to write scientific software that isn't a one-off simulation or something.
Thank you! Do you have any suggestions of where to look?

Im thinking about trying Project Euler (in either C++ or python) and seeing how far i can get
Do you have any suggestions for how i could go about doing this? Not something I have thought of doing before!
Your orbit for Mercury seems a bit off; can't figure out why.
You have written your own (forward Euler) integration routine, which is almost always going to end poorly. The theory of numerically approximating solutions to differential equations is very maturely developed (get yourself a copy of Numerical Recipes, for example). Unless your differential equation is finicky, you can almost always get away with using a standard canned integration routine like Runge-Kutta. See e.g. [scipy.integrate.odeint](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html#scipy.integrate.odeint).
If you'd like to skip the walkthrough, here's a link to [the code](https://gist.github.com/benrules2/220d56ea6fe9a85a4d762128b11adfba) and and example [visualization](http://imgur.com/j9QxThX)

I would love to see more posts like this one. Computational physics is fun to play with. You can do a lot of "experimentation" with little resources. Great for learning and research.
As someone who spent today coding Python tutorials (first time since required college learning last year) with a big dumb smile on my face, this excites me to no end.
In your future post using C++ and HPC methods will you be writing your own FMM?
Cool :) I like your coding style, very explicit and organized with the class definitons. You might be dissappointed to learn that in pratice, especially for calculations of this nature, physicists seem to have a way more lax approach to programming, and don't care so much about structure this deep. I've seen a lot of stuff just thrown into scripts. I think some physicists would probably call your use of OO interfaces a bit overkill for a problem of this nature. But I don't, I was a compsci major before physics so I dig it haha. Are you in school now? 

Edit: computational physicists do of course program with great form, especially for big projects. I just mean investigatory-type calculations like this. 

Edit2: okay, maybe even I think this is a bit overkill. Just looked through your code; it's very nice, makes me want to give it a try. But why do you need to use the "point" class? Why not just declare an acceleration, for example, as a dict 

a = {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'z': 0}

a['x'] = 2 

...

Seems like plenty, unless your "point" class had some other functionality. It is also a but misleading that the class is called 'point', yet you use it to assign vector components. 

Also, you declare the planet info as dictionaries. But then you unpack all that information into an array of 'body' objects. But your 'body' class, like your 'point' class, is pretty much no different than a 'dict' anyway. You could've just thrown all the planet dicts into the 'bodies' array as they were, and not need the 'body' class at all. Or am I missing something? 

Sorry if the code critique isn't appreciated. I just love this stuff. 
I thought this was going to be /r/simulated and you did some flipbook thing for a simulation. I'm slightly disappointed now.
First, don't read Naomi Klein's book. It appears as a bestseller [in the category](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/16053231/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_4_last), but it's just about her political opinion.

I also don't recommend James Hansen's "Storms of my Grandchildren". It's too much personal history, and hardly any good explanation of the science.

Mann and Kump's "Dire Predictions" might be what you're looking for, but I haven't had the chance to read it yet.
You might also ask /r/meteorology/ for help.
It's not about climate change per say, but I found "Energy for Future Presidents" by Richard A. Muller to be a nice, informative, breezy read before bed.  It's basically about energy policy, climate and debunking a lot of misinformation around the topic.  He also has one called "Physics for Future Presidents" which covers a lot of the same content (nuclear power/waste, solar energy, coal and natural gas, etc.).
I doubt you're going to find much in the way of books.  Best bet is to head over to the IPCC's site and start reading through their reports.  
https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/
[Principles of Planetary Climate](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Planetary-Climate-Raymond-Pierrehumbert/dp/0521865565)

Excellent book very readable.  Also gives you opportunities to model simple climate systems in python. 
Just to clarify, are you looking for resources describing climate change or an introduction to climate science?
Wrong sub. 'Consciousness' isn't really a question of physics. And in general the questions you ask are not answered yet by any science or by philosophy. (Certain religions would possibly hold some opinions on this, but from a scientific view those are mostly worthless).

If you want some info on the current state on this question then maybe Hofstadters [The Mind's I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mind's_I) would be an easy to read introduction. It's from 1982 but there didn't happen that much on this question recently.

I think there are some better reddit subs that allow rather open discussions on the subject.

You might find this [rather long] post interesting:
http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html
First of all, I don't think physics can really answer your question fully, and neither could any science. We don't know the precise mechanism which causes consciousness, the subjective experience of having experience. A lot of that is in the territory of philosophy. 
That said, I think it's reasonable to assume that consciousness is entirely a material phenomenon, that there's no need for a "soul." I was originally going to make the claim that every atom in your body is replaced every 7-10 years, but apparently many neurons are permanent, so this doesn't hold up. However, there's no reason to think that replicating your brain wouldn't preserve the function, just like replacing the gears in a car doesn't change the car. Basically you can be sure that an exact replica of your brain, using new atoms, would be a functioning brain. The twin analogy doesn't hold up, because if consciousness is a physical phenomenon, and the original brain didn't have a mechanism for fusing consciousness then neither would the new one. Two identical computers running the same program would give the same output, but they'd just be running separately.
Past this point, you may be better off asking neurosciencientists and philosophers. I don't know how memory is stored, and if preserving your brain's 3d structure would preserve your personality and memories. Then it becomes a philosophical discussion of what counts as "you." 
You might enjoy reading What is Life, by Erwin Schrodinger.
So far, we know of nothing that contradicts the Occam's razor statement that consciousness and self-awareness are emergent properties of matter. This may or may not change in the future.
That's correct! 0.2% is close enough to the speed of light for us to measure red- and blueshift in the CMB photons due to the Doppler effect. The frequencies of all CMB photons are slightly shifted depending on where you're measuring them in the sky.

Of course, a standard procedure of cosmological data analysis is to remove the red- and blueshift by going to the rest frame of the CMB.
I just found this sub, after (currently) reading The Big Picture by Sean Carroll.

This is the first post I've read so far, and my mind is sufficiently fucked.
Thank you!
no matter how hard i try i'm just too stupid to understand why you cant measure absolute speed relative to the universe/CMB by measuring light in all directions. 

i know its relative, but its hard to get how the speed of light + earths speed doesn't mean that the light is going faster than c

One test question I had went (paraphrasing from memory): 

A physics student was appearing in traffic court for running a red light. The student argues the ticket should be waived, since at the speed he was going, the red light appeared green. The judge agrees with that assessment, but then fines the student one dollar for every km/hr over the posted speed limit of 50km/hr. What is the fine?

Well [this](https://br.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081023170046AAtAkDe) problem actually exists. Anything that opens with, "You are a world-famous physicist-lawyer," must be good.
[This](http://imgur.com/a/4yXx1) is my favorite problem from my high school stats book. This was 6 years ago, so all I have is a blurry pic, but it still cracks me up to this day. The funniest part is basically that the context is ultimately irrelevant to the actual problem, which just asks you to outline a statistical study and conduct randomization. The authors didn't need to write a problem about smoking pot and weaving belts, but they just thought it was fitting for a high school textbook. Go figure.
The transport phenomena book I'm using in a class right now described random walk as a drunken sailor trying to find his way back to his ship. 
There's a problem in the general relativity syllabus of Sean Caroll. Basically about an angry space monkey with murderous intent throwing a coconut another space monkey in orbit around a black hole.

You need to calculate the correct momentum of the coconut in order to push the monkey out of orbit into the black hole.
I had one question on an exam about two witches travelling to a coven using broomsticks that were capable of relativistic velocities. I think one part was calculating the actual length of one of the witch's noses, and another was calculating whether they would survive if they got hit in the head by a bumblebee while flying haha.
Joke, not a question. Goldstein's Classical Mechanics is discussing transformation of Hamiltonians, H, into alternate forms, denoted K. He remarks if H stands for Hamiltonian, K must stand for Kamiltonian. 

I was so happy my 9th grade student didn't bother to read the foot note. Did not want to explain that one...
Chemistry: talking about acids and Base.

Not a textbook, but for intro to physics, we had a really awesome doc. We solved problems about Rambo and Chuck Norris arguing who is stronger, princesses throwing flower pots at knights from towers, lots of good stuff. And for tests throughout the year, we probably had at least a few seasons of Wile E. Coyote. Explosions, pain and graphic descriptions all in one package.
Halliday & Resnick (& Walker in recent editions) have lots of great questions like this. My favorite was when I was tutoring someone, and there was some question involving money laundering he requested I help him with. 
To check I still know my thermo... (a) just look up water tables, find the specific entropies of ice and water at 0 degC, take the difference and times by mass. (b) assume no temp change (and of course no state change), therefore no change in entropy. (c) same as (a). Can anyone confirm?
One of the questions on my current general rel. assignment involves the enterprise firing a photon torpedo at a Klingon cruiser that is close to a black hole and determining if the Klingon ship will be destroyed.

I can't find it or remember which textbook it was in, but one book I recall having a large diagram of a cat in a (possibly radioactive) box. Anyone else remember seeing this?

Way too much of this page was dedicated to this diagram. 
Mine doesn't, because it actually teaches instead of telling le funny science jokes XDDD
Classical Mechanics by Taylor is a go to in my library.
Was a big fan of Kleppner of Kolenkow for my intro mechanics class. Not sure what level AP Physics/Calc is but for reference we used it for a first year undergrad classical mechanics class. Have heard good things about Taylor's book too but haven't ever looked through it.
I've never used the Kleppner (it doesn't seem to cover Lagrangian mechanics though), but the Taylor book is pretty good.  However, this might not be what you want.  

If you are taking introductory physics, you probably don't want a "mechanics" book but rather a plain intro physics book.  For this, many of them are just fine (and all about the same).  They aren't cheap though, but if you find an older edition you might be able to score a deal (and the physics is all the same).

If you want other resources to help prepare for intro physics (I'm assuming that's what you want - but I could be wrong), then I would suggest finding some good stuff on youtube or online (since that's cheaper).
~~Landau and Lifshitz vol. 1~~ Taylor is perfectly fine.
Morin is a wonderful book.
Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics by Serway and Jewett.  Really good book, and has a ton of content.
I am by no means an expert on this subject. But I'm guessing yes and no. The core temperature would stay the same, but as the star rotates it will bulge around its equator and thus have to travel further out to its surface. This could ultimately change its thermal equilibrium and a decrease in luminous flux or maybe not. But like I said I am no expert, so my whole post could be irrelevant.
There is apparently a normal star which is spinning so fast that a part of its surface is moving at 0.14% of the speed of light. That should cause approximately 0.14% blue-shift due to the doppler effect at one edge of the star and a 0.14% red-shift on the other side, so the colour difference would be almost imperceptible.

However, there is a neutron star which is rotating at 24% of the speed of light. I imagine that that should cause a major colour difference between the advancing and receding sides.

However, I am not a physicist and know very little about stars. This is based on straightforward calculations based things found on wikipedia.
To build on the other response, energy and momentum conservation follow from invariance under time and spatial translations. 
They drop out of Noethers theorem as described. In general if you write down a (quantum) field theory (such as the standard model) for each of its symmetries you will obtain a conserved current associated with it.
Since those equations don't care about such shifts, the conserved current is the energy-momentum tensor. From the zero components of this current one can then construct a conserved "charge", which in the case of spacetime translations are momentum and energy, whose time derivatives vanish.
> Is it an empirical statement that they are conserved or is there some deeper mathematics to it?

Yes, there absolutely is a deeper explanation: [Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem) states a correspondence between conservation laws and symmetries of a system. 

For example, energy conservation corresponds to time symmetry. You can show quite directly using relatively simple mathematics that if the Lagrangian for a certain system are the same at every moment in time, then energy is conserved in that system. Similarly, momentum conservation corresponds to symmetry in space.

You can read several proofs of Noether's theorem on the Wikipedia page, or consult any advanced mechanics textbook. Beware that this subject is on the border between physics and some quite advanced differential geometry, and if you are not educated in that subject then some of the mathematics might be fearsome. Nonetheless naive derivations that don't require serious differential geometry are certainly available. 

To summarize: energy is conserved because the laws of physics are the same at every moment in time; momentum is conserved because the laws of physics are the same at every point in space.
If you accept Newton's laws as axioms conservation of momentum and energy follow as exact mathematical results. Then it's not empirical.

Symmetry is a much deeper answer but this is a simpler one for classical particles. 
Read up on Hamiltonian Mechanics.

It is not a fact that energy and momentum are conserved, and it is indeed empirical that our universe has conservation of energy and momentum.

If the partial derivative of the hamiltonian H(q_i,p_i) with respect to q_i is equal to zero, then d/dt (p_i) = 0, following Hamilton's equations, and the momentum p_i is conserved.

If the Hamiltonian is time-independent (think the overall energy of the system does not change in time), then d/dt (H) = 0. You can go through and do the calculation yourself!

You can create an infinite number of Hamiltonian systems where the energy is not conserved, or the energy is conserved, and or the momentum may or may not be conserved. If you tell me some conservation laws, I can construct your own Hamiltionian system where they are true!

As for our own universe, yes we think that our universe is a Hamiltonian system, and we think that energy and momentum are conserved, but we aren't sure. 
It is symmetry. But to understand how, you would first need to learn how mechanics can be derived from a Lagrangian. This principle applies even further to charge conservation, but that is a bit more difficult. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem)

However, it seems to me that you should review a bit. Conservation is only applied in some systems, as you should know without external forces on a system of particles (F=0=dp/dt) easily implies conservation of momentum.

The strange numbers are not found in collisions, they are found in theoretical calculations.

At least not at the current precision - so far, adding an order more always helped.


Amplituhedrons, anyone?  There is clearly something deep just beginning to surface here.
Pretty exciting if this leads to an exact sum for the perturbative series of a few more field theories.

A=XLX',  B=YLY',  where X and Y are matrices of eigenvectors and L is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Y' = hermitian transpose of Y.

Then we can do:
L=Y'BY   
A = XLX' = XY'BYX'

So, U = YX', where X is the eigenvectors of A and Y is the eigenvectors of B.

Long story short: it's important to remember that, for hermitian A, you can always write A as A=XLX', where X is orthonormal and L is diagonal.

Edit: FYI this is more of a /r/learnmath or /r/askmath question.
As the operators are self adjoint you can choose the eigenvectors
s.t. they form an orhtonormal basis.  Let {uᵢ} be the eigenvectors of A
with eigenvalues aᵢ and {vᵢ} the eigenvectors of B with eigenvalues aᵢ.
Set Uuᵢ = vᵢ and extend by linearity.  As U maps one orhtonormal basis
to another it’s unitary.  And we have

U⁺BU uᵢ = U⁺Bvᵢ = U⁺bᵢvᵢ = aᵢuᵢ = Auᵢ

Thus U⁺BU and A coincide on a basis and by linearity on all vectors.

First year will be largely a re-tread of high-school, just to make sure everyone's on the same page. If you didn't get a full high school physics background I wouldn't worry too much.  Other students might be more familiar, but that's why the first year is structured that way, to make sure, if high school couldn't provide it, that you know the content you need to move forward.
Math. Lots of math. It's going to feel like you signed up for a math class that just has a physics theme to it. And the equations you need to use will often seem very simple and straightforward until you need to apply them in homework problems, at which point you realize you may not understand things as well as you thought.

You see, Physics is a bit different from other courses. It's not necessarily harder, but different enough that it creates a steep learning curve early on that intimidates most students.
I found there to be a few jumps in difficulty along the way. Some were due to the math, and some were due to the concepts.

At my university, you learn intro mechanics (most of what you learn in high school) then intro electromagnetism (also touched on in high school) and then an intro class for special relativity and quantum mechanics. After taking all the intro classes, you revisit each topic in detail taking a year of advanced mechanics, then a year of real electromagnetism, a year of quantum then electives. 

The first big jump in difficulty for me was learning electromagnetism. This was difficult because I slacked when learning calc 3 (vector calculus used heavily in E&M). It was also the beginning of things getting pretty abstract, outside of what humans typically experience. With mechanics, most of the time if you apply common sense and math you can work most things out from scratch (obviously it gets difficult but it always seems to make *sense*). To prepare for E&M I would make sure to be ready for lots and lots of math, particularly some those later calc classes.

Quantum mechanics trips a lot of people up. Its quantum and its confusing and there's really no way around it. From my experience the difficulty in quantum was understanding the concepts and what was going on, the math wasn't as bad as others. I'm not sure what someone could to do prepare for quantum, its something that you need to get your hands on and work with to understand. The best approach to quantum would probably be to work with others and talk it out, and ask the instructor questions. It probably won't make sense the first time you hear it (at least it didn't for me) so it was nice to be able to go over things multiple times with classmates and the professor.

Other than that, always try to understand the connection between the physics and the math. Different branches of physics use different types of math and understanding how that all works was definitely valuable for me. You can drown in the math and a lot of people seem to but if you keep an understanding of how the math translates to the physics you can avoid a lot of ugly math using tricks related to the physics of the problem (for example, exploiting symmetry in a problem can make nasty math virtually disappear). Its a physics major, not math. So despite the crazy amount of math involved, you're doing physics and people lose sight of that and try to brute force the math when it doesn't have to be that way. 

I'm finishing up my physics-math double major this year and I've loved it so if any of that rambling wall of text sounds negative, it wasn't meant to. Its been very challenging and very rewarding, which is *exactly* what I was looking for.

**TLDR:** Its great. Be ready for jumps in difficulty when learning a new topic. E&M introduces scary math but it's doable. Quantum is confusing for everyone so discussion is useful. There is a metric shit load of math, but keep an eye on the physics.
I remember it being a large step up in difficulty. Depending on where you go there will be lots of people to work with which personally helped me a lot. Plus it's always awesome having a bunch of people that you can nerd out with about math or physics!
Depends on the institution. My experience was that the first two or three semesters were pretty straightforward. By the end of sophomore year, you'll start getting trusted with some tougher concepts. Junior year is typically where the biggest jump in difficulty occurs.

Another significant impact on how easy/difficult your first year will be is whether or not you had any exposure to calculus in high school. I came in having already done the BC calculus AP, and it gave me a pretty big leg up to have already had a conceptual understanding of differentiation and integration.
didn't take a single physics course in hs, and only calc ab but enjoyed it. came in as an engineer to a highly accredited uni. hated EE, and switched to engineering physics. at that time I had taken Newtonian mechanics, E&M, and a waves and optics course. Uni phys 1,2, & 3. I didn't do too well cause I didn't care about those because nothing new has come about in those fields in over 80+ years. But junior year I got hit with the big guns and took atomic and nuclear physics in the nuclear engineering department. have to say the learning curve to modern physics is steep. but it is worth it; I loved every minute of it. I'm now studying plasma physics and nuclear (fusion) engineering. have to say I can't imagine myself doing anything else. Realize uni isn't high school, community college, or your regular state college. the shit is hard and it deserves your time, ESPECIALLY physics. read your text books because that's where you get your deep theoretical understanding. profs are there to help you get through learning it and not hold your hand and ask if you're ok. you get out of it what you put in. go to office hours, ask questions, and read your text book. Junior year is hard cause you're starting taking hard mathematical classes that aren't overviews. but by senior year, you get use to it and start taking physics electives that are a lot of fun. 
For particle physics repairing and testing circuits and hardware is probably at the top. For example, checking that each individual sensor on an area detector works is something I can see an undergraduate working on.
In my experience, lots of repeating the same procedure over and over and over again. See, as an undergrad you wouldn't typically be in charge of any experiments yourself. You're there as an assistant to the grad students, taking care of the menial work so they can focus on more important things like writing grant proposals and preparing for conferences and actually analyzing the data you collect.

So in my case, the work was usually something like "Here are the samples we want to analyze. Put them in the machine and collect reflection and absorption measurements between 200 and 1200 nm wavelength in 5 nm increments."
Calibrating detectors.
Data analysis...
Interesting, I believe that's why data science is becoming always more needed and data scientist are paid incredibly well...is not only about storing them but how to display large amount of data...
Pilot G-2 07 I buy them in huge packs at Costco, it's the only pen I use 
Your basic Bic mechanical pencil is the preferred for all my math.  Doing math in pen is a special horror I should never wish inflicted on even my greatest enemy (if I had one).

>I've tried so many different ultra fine point pens to make scratch work neater and they all have issues (like runny ink, rough lines, etc).

I'm a leftie, so I smudge all over what I write anyways, plus my writing is so horrendous I can't even read it myself the next day.  I mostly do math to get ideas straight in my head for the "here and now" or to get some expression that I then copy into my LaTeX research notes.
I use a Pentel Graphgear 1000 as my mechanical pencil. But I mostly use a variety of fountain pens. Check out /r/fountainpens
I only ever use pencils.

Ticonderoga #2 - Black wood.

They have the best graphite and erasers I've yet to find on any pencils. They also sharpen beautifully - none of that crap that cheap pencils do when you try to sharpen them.
0.5 mm G2 pen.
Nice medium between too fine and too thick. They are write a lot better than pen you buy in like packs of 10+ and inks are cheap on amazon
I use a Parker Urban Premium Blue fountain pen. With quink it glides like nothing else. Drawing orbitals and molecular bounds is a joy! In the past I had times when I only used 0.5mm red rotring pencils or black pilot frixion pen 0.5mm.
I havent done anything in pencil since first year undergrad when I got papers back all smeared.

I am picky about buying pretty stationery so I mostly buy from kikki-k. They have refillable pens too so I end up with the same pens every time. I've found some very smooth ones. Smoothness is pretty much my main variable when looking at pens. I go for black over blue too.
i specialize in that field.

there's no better pen than the

*uniball eye micro (0.5mm) ub-150*

. there's a slightly thicker verson uniball eye fine (0.7mm) which i don't like.

they are extremely accurate, never smear. i swear, these are the best. try them. (i prefer black or blue.)

(i've tried jetstream once, frankly, it's shit compared to this.)

when i use pencils i use mechanical ones HB with 0.5mm thickness.
Mostly I use my Pilot Custom 91 fountain pen with fine nib.

Here are some stock pictures of this beautiful writing instrument:

I've always used pencil for any scratch work and notes. My pencil of choice has always been the Pentel quicker clicker that you click with your index finger. I find it interrupts my flow less when advancing the pencil lead. 

For pens, Uniball Roller Micro or Pilot Precise V5 Extra Fine are my preferred pens 
Uniball Jetstream is my favorite (0.5 or 0.7 mm). The ink dries instantly and it's very smooth. Pencil smears too much imo.
I'm not a fan of MOND but I'm also not a fan of the kludge that is Dark Matter...

Still Dark Matter fits the evidence available thus far, so it 'wins'. At least until we have more data.
Did wolfie just casually slip in his cellular automata theory of everything again? Is he physically capable of shutting up about it?

You say spoilers but the article says:

Now I don't know what to do.
I must live under a rock because I've never heard of Wolfram Language (although I did use Wolfram Alpha for Calc).  What's the deal?  Do people use it? 

I tried to copy the code and try it out on my laptop when I realized it was just an image :(
Wait, the Wolfram was named after a guy ? physics turns into TIL sometimes.
I imagine it would be similar structure to the statement of purpose (SOP) that grad school programs ask for. So if you look up grad school application essays, you'll find tons of tips and samples online. Obviously your research experience won't be as extensive (if you have any at all), so your essay would focus more on why you're interested in a research topic rather than your past experiences.
What are you interested in, what are you good at, why do you want to do it, why would you be good for it. Give the supervisor a reason to pick you. Don't worry too much about fitting some general pro-forma in my opinion, if you really want to do a REU just write an honest paragraph or two why.
> As the physics subreddit now becomes a giant one [...]

Really? This is already I think the slowest moving sub I visit, with a handful of top-level posts and maybe 10s of new comments each day, with *rare* spikes that localize in a single thread (like job angst posts, or today's funny textbook questions). There are a lot of people subscribed, I guess, but very few "regulars."

I feel like in the best case this sort of ultra-specialization will be redundant (any useful content on your sub will either originate or end up crossposted here) but in the worst case it just cannibalizes potentially good content from this already small, slowly paced sub.

So no offense, but I hope you fail miserably. Not because of any ill-will towards you, but so that you'll come back and make r/physics a better place for QI news and discussion.
There's already a /r/QuantumComputing subreddit. How does yours differ?
Measure it.  Put a little tab of tape on it that makes a little 'tick-tick-tick' as it goes around.  Record it with a high sample rate and either measure the time between ticks, or FFT the audio and see if you can pick it out from among the biggest spikes, or hook the audio up to an oscilloscope if you have the equipment, or assign it as an extra credit problem for your students.
I mean you should be able to obtain the theoretical RPM through easy enough calculations... But counting it is more accurate.
Congrats and stay sober! Your GPA is reasonable-ish, just start applying everyplace where you don't mind moving to. You might start as a tech and move up from there, don't rule out "technician" from your CL search to get your foot in the door and build some experience. Silicon companies hire BA physics to run the multi-million dollar vacuum and vapor deposition tools. You might have to apply to a lot of places to get a hit, good luck to you!
Engineering grad school.  You'll get a more focused degree that will help you get a job and engineering is a cake walk after completing a degree in physics.
Grad school.
Also in long term recovery.

Also graduating in a month with a BS in physics. 

My suggestion is grad school... but with no research experience it will be hard... very hard.


.
Email local college professors, ask if you can contribute/help with any projects they are working on. This is an easy way to start building your experience. Those professors will also be extremely helpful in assisting you, assuming you form good relationships. Grad school is something you should be considering if you want to work in physics. Also, just apply and apply for the positions you want. Don't be discouraged if you don't receive positive results immediately. A physics degree will turn heads. Congrats on your sobriety, that is a true testament to your character and will. 
Came back to say... You could probably get into a lower tier university that is trying to build its name and expand it's program... 

Get a master's there. Prove yourself, then go get a PhD somewhere better. 
Was in your same position.  Instead of going to grad school I highly recommend finding either startups or small companies to work for.  The reason, especially for startups, is that these 2 types of companies are looking for more rounded people that can do a lot of different tasks.  

I started at a small company where I leveraged my LabView experience (all I knew was how to press the button right) and then on my job I learned how to program in Python and LabView and in Arduino as well as get experience as a Test Engineer.  

If you have any questions give me a PM, I'll be more than willing to help!
I had a similar GPA (for a B.S.) and some research but not much and no publications. I was accepted to a few phd programs (funded). I think if you want to do grad school you can. Apply to state schools. 

I had a friend with a similar GPA get a position as a lab tech for a reputable lab. He was Biochem, but I am sure you could do that as well. 

*EDIT: I applied for jobs out of undergrad as a backup to grad school. I immediately got an engineering position offering nearly 6 figures. So I am not sure why everyone is posting such negative experiences. Maybe they interview poorly? 

I graduated with a B.A. Physics in 2013. Shit is rough man. Good luck.

First job out of college I made $13/hr as an EE of sorts. A lot of hardware programming. I was lucky to have a manager who was very patient and taught me everything he could. I wouldn't have been able  to get my current job without the knowledge I gained from him.

Now make ~18/hr doing similar EE/EE tech stuff.

You're going to have to bust your balls just to make a fraction of what you're probably worth unless you get a PhD Physics or a Master's in some other field.
congratulations on getting clean, man. do you have any programming experience? i graduated with a ba back in may and now work as a software engineer in the aerospace industry. 

if you're worried about a poor gpa and lack of experience, working professionally can probably help make up for that.
My advice is as follows. 

On your resume write bachelors instead of ba or bs.

Look for work as a engineer or accountant or anything else technical or math related you might enjoy.

Physics positions are few and highly competitive.
If you are willing to move in a more computational direction, you should check out computer science masters programs.

One that's generated a lot of buzz is Georgia Tech's online masters (OMS CS), which is a totally online program, costs like 7k in tuition total, and is an accredited masters from a top-10 CS university. Not sure exactly how selective they are, but average incoming GPA is around 3.5. A lot of physics jobs involve/require a lot of programming anyway, and this would also open the door to less physics-y, but still very interesting jobs. 
I'm working on my B.A. In physics. I plan to go to the peace corps for 2 years and when I get back the government will pay for your graduate school. 
>With all that said, I really want to pursue a career in physics,

You won't.

>Do I have any shot at landing any internships/ lab tech positions with my degree?

Nope

>Does anyone have any advice or words of wisdom or maybe some suggestions for me to start my career in the field of physics?

Give up now.

Look for a career in IT or, if you're lucky, some type of computer programming job. You can start at the ground floor, maybe, and they'll give you an entry-level position.

I'm sorry for sounding negative, but I am just giving you the facts from my own personal experience.

I graduated with a B.S. in Physics in 2013. I had 2 years of research experience and I'd worked a normal salaried IT job for 3 years before going to school.

Since that time, I haven't been able to find a single full-time job *anywhere*, much less in Physics. I haven't had a single interview for any Physics job at all.

The jobs I've held have been:

-Contracting data entry position

-Contracting excel spreadsheet monkey

-Part-time math tutor

-Contracting programmer

Even with a Physics degree, getting jobs in fields of Engineer, Statistics, and Computer Science is nearly impossible because they frankly don't think you're qualified with your Physics degree.
What about the Schrödinger eqt for a particle in 1D with potential ~ x^(-2)? Basically

(∂_x^(2) + κ/x^(2)) ψ = E ψ

Where κ is a constant. I've been told this admits bound (normalizable) states iff κ > 1/4. Does anyone know more about this or has a reference for how this result is proven?
So, I am in high school and I'm taking a physics class where I've taken an opportunity to do an extra credit project. I am also currently reading A Brief History of Time and so decided to use something that I have learned from there for my project. Thinking I kind of grasped the concept and could just do some more research to be able to present it, I asked to work on stars, black holes, and antimatter. From my understanding from what I've read in the book (which now I think may have totally been off track) stars are formed by particles and antiparticles that are held together by gravity running into each other, basically exploding, and letting off heat that we can see. Was I totally off on this understanding? I've been googling but can't find any sites or resources I trust that seem to be saying this.


Anyways, basically any information or resources that will help me better understand antimatter and star and black hole formation would be super duper appreciated. 

Also, sorry if I seem ignorant or dumb -while this stuff absolutely fascinates me and I love learning about it, it is very hard for me to grasp and I don't think I really have the brain capacity for it! So really any help or information would be awesome!
When covering the hydrogen atom in quantum mechsnics, the potential is spherically symmetric, I.e. it only depends on r. So why is that we can't just take the wave function to only be a function of r as well? We can do that for other spherically symnetric problems, so why not here?
Would entangled radioactive atoms decay at the same time?
When a star begins to collapse, elements fuse into higher elements until it reaches lead, where it stalls.   Why?  What is it about lead that temporarily halts this process?
Can someone conceptually explain the relationship between tangential velocity and centripetal acceleration? 

For example, uniform circular motion is defined as an object moving at a constant speed in a circular path. Let's say v=10m/s but is always changing direction while radius is 2 m. When we plug it into the equation for centripetal acceleration, a=v^2 /r, we get 50 m/s/s. What does this really mean? The centripetal acceleration has no impact on the magnitude of the tangential velocity, but what exactly is increasing by 50 m/s per second?
Could we ever observe (or at the very least model) gravity strong enough to tear apart hadrons? Would this only be possible inside a black hole (meaning outside of what we can actually meaningfully talk about)?

If it is possible, then what would happen to the quarks? Would their color charges be randomly locked, or would they carry individual uncertainty?
Can a liquid substance that conducts electricity experience a net non-zero electric field inside of it (without a current passing through)? So far everywhere I've searched has stated that the net electric field inside a conductor is always zero because that is when the charges in the conductor will stop being polarized. Is there any sort of limit to this? Can the strength of the applied field be raised high enough to exceed a conductor's ability to completely negate it internally?
Hypothetically, how would we go about creating a machine that, instead of minimizing gravity, maximizes gravitational force, without using a centrifuge? And based on of the effect of gravity on our bodies, how would the additional gravity effect our bodies, would our muscles continuously tear up and heal, artificially creating new muscle growth?
I'm writing a sci-fi screenplay and am trying to get the physics right. My main questions evolve around the topic of "if x happens to Earth what are the effects on gravity, orbit, sea levels, etc." ... where can I find the right people to ask? Would /r/AskPhysics be appropriate?

Hi, I just watched the movie Arrival and the friend I watched it with claims that it has something to do with the the Principle of Least Action. He used the analogy of a ray of light bending under water to say that the light 'chooses' the path of least action to get from point a to point b. So i guess my question is, does this principle of least action imply any violation of causality? Does the light somehow know ahead of time which path to take and take that? or is this just another way of thinking of classical mechanics? 
So I'm in high school physics and I can't quite figure out a concept. Should the force of gravity on earth due to the moon be equal to the force of gravity between them? This is the only way I can think of calculating it but it just really doesn't seem right.
What exactly is nonlinear gravitational clustering? 
The only suggestion I can make is to look at different institutions located in the same city.

Finding a postdoctoral position at all can be frustratingly difficult without placing restrictions on yourself.
Happened to several of my friends. No problem, you just have to search very actively. I had one couple of friend that had to wait 8 month before being able to work on the same city. 

I saw this working out in Massachusetts, Texas, Norway and France, so it is possible basically anywhere.

The two-body problem is always at the core of a physics career.  It's pretty hard to get it right.  I only finished my PhD a few years ago, but the only people I know who still live in the same place with their same SO are those who had SOs that were flexible in their career (or stay at home).  That being said, there were some who were both physicists and still together, but none live in the same city (6 hour drive is the closest I've seen).
You would be wise to take steps to reduce the possibility of this coming down to random chance.
> I would want to break up over a post doc position

Odds are practically nil, you can enjoy single life again soon without it being your fault you broke up.
Every paper you read assumes that you are familiar with the successes of previous papers.

There are many successes here.

The obvious one is LSS. Starting with LambdaCDM, people then do large computational simulations of LSS and check how it is similar to catalogs built up from observations. Comparing them is tricky due to biases in the catalogs, details of the simulations, and the presence of baryonic physics. People are working to sort out these problems but, in general, the data agree with LambdaCDM, a fact that is entirely unclear without the simulations.

This is just one of many examples.

(Also, "predicting the weather to a ridiculous degree" - I don't know where you live, but most places aren't accurate more than a few days to a week out, beyond that the steady state solution is usually comparable. On the other hand, we run universe simulations spanning billions of years and do pretty well.)
There's a fundamental difference between the fields you're mentioning and computational cosmology: these other fields are far less retrospective. If you're simulating the weather, you're gonna know pretty soon if it your rested model was wrong; same if you're building a bad airplane or making a bad drug. Cosmological simulations follow almost the opposite path of "here's an effect no model can explain. can you come up with one? what if XYZ was the explanation?" - which arguably is less scientific when you get down to it, but far from useless.

As an aside, a better comparison would be with eg. the field of Lattice QCD, where particle physicist start off knowing the rules they want to include + the masses of fundamental particles, and attempt to reproduce their (already measured) interaction rates. You're gonna be able to tell if the model you assumed flies, but only down to statements like "so we really need X, Y doesn't make a difference, and Z and T are degenerate".

That being said, there are certainly cases where cosmological simulations have predicted values for constants we have no way of measuring directly:

- Alberto Rorai's simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.0210v1.pdf
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03805v1.pdf

The physics of gas in the intergalacitc medium are well understood enough to allow very fine comparison to data and measure things like the Jeans scale ("auto-collapse scale"), which is not something we could measure directly. Simulations tell us that a smaller scale would result in sharper features, which are not seen.

Same goes for the temperature of gas in the IGM. Not only do comparisons of data to simulated Lyman-alpha lines of sight work, it has even excluded models of warm dark mater:

- Julien Baur's hydrodymical sims compared to SDSS III data:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01981

This is again because the physics of intergalactic gas at those epochs in the universe have become very well understood.

And while we're at it, let's mention

- all of the Planck data
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01589v3.pdf (large)

Where they have measured things like the total matter content of the universe, its age, constraints on the mass of dark matter particles, curvature of the universe, etc by producing simulated CMB maps then comparing to the real one. Sims are a necessary part of CMB cosmology because the equations involved are non-analytic.
And before you say that these values are all model-dependent (a) some are consistent across many models and (b) that's how science goes: LCDM has established itself as the best model we have by far in terms of how many phenomena it explains and the accuracy to which it does so. Details of LCDM will definitely be refined with time, but those parameter measures are robust to those small additions.

But maybe you meant a different kind of cosmological simulation, as none of the one I've mentioned so far use 'sub-grid physics' to any noticeable extent.

Simulations of Reionisation **do** produce verifiable (and disprovable) predictions.

Simulations which predict the 21 cm background will be tested once we measure it, within the next 5-10 years. No link here because 100 of them come out per week :P

Simulations of Reionisation, the sources responsible for it, and radiative transfer are testable and already being tested. Take for example the competing models of 

- Chardin: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.01853v1.pdf

- Davies & Furlanetto: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07131

- D'Aloisio: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02523

These three models were all motivated by 1 observation: the fact that the Lyman-alpha forest is correlated on enormous scales even after Reionisation has ended. This was extremely unexpected, so these groups all theorised processes with which it could happen, ran simulations, and concluded their models were viable.

Now these 3 models use very different ingredients to make it work: rare quasars, mean free path effects arising 'naturally' from a large enough box size, and temperature fluctuations. These are all independently testable: quasars should definitely be observable. The other 2 models make opposite prediction on where early galaxies are located with respect to the most hydrogen-opaque regions: in a mean-free-path driven model, galaxies are responsible  for low opacity, so should be found to correlate with those regions. In a temperature-driven model, the now-opaque parts reionised early, and the low opacity is where the gas is still hot - so the galaxies are located in the high opacity regions.

This is just an example I'm familiar with and this post is getting long. There are tons of similar examples where different simulated models explain X phenomenon but differ in testable respects, from baryonic feedback to black hole growth. Feel free to ask me about it if you want.

TLDR; what have we learnt? The Universe is 13.7 By old, dark matter is not warm, the Jeans scale of IGM hydrogen at z=3 is about 110 kpc, and to explain X we need either Y or G, not Z, and B doesn't make a difference; we'll know better when the observations are made.
Yes, it has. Simulations are the best way we know to test our theories against observation. I'm working on a modified hydrodynamic simulation of dark matter that matches closely to observed large scale behavior. Simulations are also essential in galaxy formation research. Simulated cosmic ray feedback and other feedback mechanisms have given us a clearer picture of the mechanisms of galaxy formation. 
>there seems to be hardly any way to realistically validate the simulation results

That's not true. Take radiative transfer for example (which is really theory not something "studied" by these simulations but anyway). With a large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation that has been set up for radiative transfer we can compare it to the Lyman alpha Forest in the real universe by making mock observations. We can study the column density distribution, the distribution of the Doppler parameter distribution, the clustering with other tracers, the powerspectrum, the metallicity of the lines (trends with column density, clustering)... The Lyman alpha Forest is one of the most information rich examples but it's not like there is a lack of tests for these simulations in all fields. Even something with like reionisation which is poorly understood, you still have constraints to match like the CMB constraints and the Gunn-Peterson trough and other data on the thermal history of the IGM. Unlike some of the other fields you mentioned reionisation is at a point where the good data doesn't exist yet, there are many models and the data will discriminate with future tests like Lyman alpha emitters, 21cm experiments, high redshift QSOs and GRBs and hopefully reionisation bubbles. 

So these simulations are definitely testable, what about successes. Well the standard cosmological model today, LCDM, would not exist without simulations. It was simulations which showed how structure formation was possible in a CDM universe. These simulations were much more primitive than the ones today but even still they had a huge impact. The largest cosmological simulations today are to test LCDM, to see how closely we can measure parameters in the model, how to look for deviations away from standard cosmology. We can make simulations with a hundred different cosmologies, we only have one universe.
Sub-grid modelling is not as "sketchy" as you think (although there exist some poor subgrid models out there). Let's start with an example of the subgrid model for turbulence. In cosmological simulations, you excite turbulence during structure formation which cascades kinetic energy to smaller and smaller scales. We cannot resolve the microscopic dissipation scale in the simulation. Instead, the kinetic energy artificially builds up on the grid scale. However, this can be fixed by a subgrid model that removes kinetic energy on the smallest scale and converts it to heat on the right timescale. Then the solution gives physically the right answer, and there is no free parameter in this subgrid model. It is clear you want this subgrid model in the simulation to get accurate results.

The goal of subgrid models in general is to create other parameter-free descriptions of small-scale physics which you know is present (e.g. turbulence, supernova explosions, black hole jets, ...). This is usually done by actually running detailed simulations of the small-scale physics and then building the subgrid model for it. There is a lot of success as we make more and more of our subgrid models parameter-free.

Eventually all subgrid models will be paramter-free, as we inform the subgrid models by simulations of small patches of the subgrid physics. However, it can still be valuable to study ad hoc subgrid models as well, in order to rule out certain classes of effective subgrid models. For example, momentum vs energy driven galactic feedback (these are really the 2 basic ways you can imagine galactic feedback). Different classes of feedback may always have specific effects on galaxies, regardless of the parameters you choose for them, and so it is possible to rule one out. It is also not true that you can get any answer you want from physically motivated subgrid models, despite the parameter space being infinite. For example, it is nearly impossible to change large-scale Lyman alpha forest statistics with galaxy feedback. You can learn what aspects of cosmology are least susceptible to astrophysical feedback, as a result.

I also just want to say, as others have pointed out, that computational cosmology has been very successful at showing of what the non-linear regime of structure formation leads to (voids, filaments, cosmic web), and also explaining the Lyman alpha forest (before simulations people thought it was due to individual clouds, but really the topology is the gas tracing the filaments and voids). Explaining Lyman alpha forest observations is one of the enormous successes of computational cosmology.

In short, subgrid models are a very reasonable thing to do to accurately capture small-scale physics in a simulation, and people are working on making these subgrid models parameter-free
This is one of the things where if you constantly move the goalpost of what counts as an advance in order to fit your narrative, your narrative will always be fit.
Already mentioned here but let me add. 

The distribution of galaxies on the largest scale is a statistical quantity which depends on the cosmological model. In other words in a universe where dark matter makes up 30% of the energy in the universe,  the clustering of galaxies will look different than in a universe where dark matter makes up 90% of the energy budget. Simulations allow us to play with things like baryon, dark matter or dark energy content and pin down what we expect these components to be by comparing with observations. 

The properties of dark matter can also only be predicted using simulations since the clustering on galaxy scales is highly non linear and intractable analytically. Therefore, whether we should be looking for the lightest supersymetric particle or a sterile neutrino depends on how the dark matter particle clusters (its "free streaming" length). Other modifications to conventional physics like quintessence dark energy or changing general relativity (via e.g. a fifth force) have a direct impact on the clustering properties of galaxies in the large scale distribution of matter. Hence simulations can also be used to constrain modified gravity. 
As another point of interest, simulations are basically the only true means to study post-inflationary cosmology (reheating, etc.). This is because preheating (and cosmology in general) is inherently non-linear, which precludes any analytic work from being able to capture all of the relevant or important physics. Thus, simulations are the only means to truly study this regime.
Yes.
Google Scholar sorts things by citations.
You should not be looking for papers.  What you want is the most recent topical review.

There are things like Review of Modern Physics and Nature Reviews and a dozen other sources.  It all depends on sub-field.  For Condensed Matter, though it's a little out of date, I've found this list useful in the past:

Hi there, have been reading a little about complexity theory here and there for a while now and thought it would be fun to put together some thoughts in a blog post. Sharing here in case anyone finds of interest.
This is cool to me, because this either means that the earthquake in New Zealand was really powerful, or that the instruments in the LHC are really, really sensitive.

Which is it?
True story.  Back in 2002 a coworker of mine was the first person to connect seemingly disparate seismic events and an unexplained Tevatron quench.  As far as I know, he was the first person to connect these kinds of dots (earth quakes affecting hadron colliders). 

 http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/december-2009/was-that-a-quake-ask-the-tevatron

Also looks like it detected some after shocks too. Here is the USGS data on it too http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us1000778i#executive
I guess the recent Italian quakes would have been registered too, unless they happened during a TS.
[Source](https://lhc-beam-operation-committee.web.cern.ch/lhc-beam-operation-committee/LBOC-Documents.html), with the accompanying description:

> An earthquake in New Zealand (M 7.8) at 11:02 UTC on November 13th 2016 (12:02 local LHC time) is visible together with the earth tides on the mean LHC orbit (here expressed in relative energy change) during a very long fill with proton and lead ion beams.

Some slides (and a paper in the second link) that go into more detail about how earthquakes affect the LHC:

http://indico.cern.ch/event/567839/contributions/2295261/  
https://indico.cern.ch/event/448109/contributions/1942067/
So what exactly is happening here to detect the earthquake? An increase in collisions caused by the shaking or something?
I'll probably go google it after this but is there any data from LIGO?
This is pretty cool, but what I think is cooler is that the sinusoidal 'background' function is due to the *tides*.
So the LHC can be used as an overpowered seismograph? Cool!
Can anybody explain how exactly earthquakes of varying size are distinguished from interstellar gravitational waves? Are the earthquakes significantly larger than the say a black hole merger event? And if so, what distinguishes *those* from other small seismic activity on Earth?
Here is part 2 of the video where a simple derivation of the Schrodinger equation is given: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEgWbrMv6-k.
Well the clipping in audio signals is due to you saturating an amplifier at some point in the signal chain at some frequency (band). If you had an optical amplifier and input a source with some band in frequency you could see clipping by seeing the output of the beam having a different composition in terms of the intensity of the various frequencies of light. In terms of does the signal "shape" get changed in the time domain. I suppose it should, there is no guarantee that your amplifying medium wouldn't output a different beam profile (say non gaussian compared to a gaussian input). It would be impossible to have hard edges in any distorted waveform since light is well... a wave (sorta) and diffraction effects will always round out any intensity profile you may have. 
In wave-speak, clipping [distortion] is the generation of harmonics: some process takes some of the energy away from the fundamental frequency and puts it into harmonic frequencies that are multiples of the fundamental. In an audio amplifier, this happens because the amplifier does non-linear things when it is asked to amplify too much. 

An analogous effect for light waves is related to non-linear effects as well. You'd never be able to 'clip' a light wave like a sound signal, the frequency is far too high (~10^(14) Hz) for any electronics to handle. However, non-linear crystals have a non-linear dielectric response to EM fields, and so they generate light at higher harmonics [see this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-harmonic_generation). Its the primary way that you get a 532nm green beam or a 266nm UV beam from a 1064 IR [ND-YAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nd:YAG_laser) laser.
Nothing. Handed in my thesis and getting hammered now.

Oh, and teaching math to freshmen.
I'm currently in Singapore trying to finish some papers with my supervisor (who's been here since June) and some other collaborators here. Next week I'm giving a talk at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology!
same as always. particle physics ist still my favorite lecture over solid state physics and "thermodynamics+stat. mech."

we have to hand in our first lab report this friday, just have to add a few sentences to the conclusion. which is basically that we got a bunch of results, some are close to what they should be, some arent at all, we dont really know whoy, but it is most likely the pretty old equipment.

we got the data for the second experiment and it looks meh. we get 5; 2.6 ; 2.6 micro seconds as the lifetime of myons depending on which methode we use to calculate it. with the actual one being at 2.2 microseconds.

the one experiment that we did last frida was the longest one we had so far but also the one where we learned the most. we "cleaned" a tungsten sample and used LEED to check if it is clean, to afterwards examine using PES. which we didnt, we just got data for a Ytterbium-Iridium-Silicon Crystal and are supposed to say a couple words about it.
Hey,

Working on optical simulations (for now) of a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell that promises >25% efficiency at low cost. Got some nice results already using an EVA/dioxide stack in-between the top and bottom cells, but I am not fully happy yet, I am working on designing some Mie resonators/ nanowires to better filter and transmit long wavelength photons to the Silicon. Also, trying to incorporate some pathlength enhancement factor into my simulations to get results closer to reality. Excited about finishing this so I can go and start building it. :)
Working on antiproton backgrounds for the Mu2e experiment @ fermilab. The group is doing some simulations.

Should we be careful about the conclusions? 

I am doing a PhD. in CFD and study the behavior of blood in the human heart. We don't even know what are the proper (understand "most accurate") model to use and numerous paper investigate the use of different models, showing essentially nothing novel : that we understand nothing. 

In particular the last paper of the kind I read was investigating the numerous non newtonian model and showing that the vortical structures changed (you don't say). 

What my point is : CFD alone is not a good tool. CFD needs to be validated against similar experiments. In my field, we call un-validated CFD simulations "colorful fluid dynamics". 

That said, I am not an expert of the specific field so it could be possible that this validation has been done already. 
I'm not in the field of plasma physics (I'm a materials scientist) so I'm not altogether sure, if anyone has read the linked paper do you think these vortex states could have topological stability? 
Seems self explanatory 
Great use of resources. Love it!
The object height is fixed at 1.  You can adjust the focal length,f, the object distance, o, and the curvature of the lens, a.  
Very good job. A couple of comments that you may find fun to implement.

1) Drawing the virtual rays to seem them converge at the virtual image location. (dashed lines or something) 

2) Add a mode where the two radii of curvature and index of refraction can be changed separately, rather than just changing the overall focal length.

3) After (2), add support for changing the index of refraction of the surrounding medium. Use lens-maker's equation. Then one could see how the normal convex->converging rule gets flipped with a lens made of air that is put underwater.

4) Add support for different indices of refraction of the material outside of the lens on either side of the lens. Lenses with air on one side and water on the other side for example.

5) Don't know how capable the language is, but add support for dispersion: Different focal lengths for different colors of light. One could see chromatic aberrations.

Again, great tool, thanks for sharing!
Can I share a physics based desmos thing? It isn't 100% complete, but that's only because I can't deal with the huge amount of numbers involved.
I use my nails to scratch symbols onto a rock.
Chalk. Always :)
I don't feel any better at doing problems, but I enjoy fine writing utensils and it can be a small motivating factor in doing my work. I use the rotring 600 .3mm

Edit: .3mm, not .3m 
I use a Pilot Roller Ball on unlined paper to do idea generation.  Base idea in a center circle with sub-ideas going off in all directions like spokes of a wheel.
I like to do all of my work in LaTeX in a good editor like WinEdt. Its a huge help to be able to copy/paste long formulas and then just change the parts you want to simplify. Also I'd die without the undo-redo features. 

Plus, you don't have to re-type it out of a notebook to get it looking great.

Python, download anaconda, profit. 
C++ because I use ROOT and GEANT4 a lot.
Fortran. Yes really. If you're doing any sort of 'big maths' Fortran is completely unbeatable.

Plus it's come on a long way. Modern Fortran even allows lowercase letters!
My favorite language? Probably C++ / CUDA. I use it all the time for research and it's growing on me.

The language I want to like the most? [Julia](http://julialang.org/). It's an up-and-coming JIT compiled language that has the simplicity of python, but boasts of speeds closer to C++ (if you write well optimized code). I would definitely suggest taking a look at it, if you are interested!
Lisp is my favorite because I can write a single expression as my entire code. It feels like when you write a complex physics equation using only SI base units. 

Though as far as usefulness in physics I use matlab and fortran the most 
I love python, the way it is written just makes sense to me. Most of the time I am using MATLAB however for image processing, and vectorized code is pretty neat imo.
Surprised to not see any Haskell people here yet.
Python for bashing things out that I want to keep but modify or unix stuff, ansii c for quick and dirty, or arduino. 
Python absolutely, and cython if it ever gets too slow (which is rare).
Don't know if it's my favorite language yet, but rust has a lot of promise. Speed of C, type system similar to Haskell, safety like nothing else, and in many cases the convenience of python. It still needs some work, though, the compiler is slow and there aren't a lot of libraries available. The language itself is still growing and changing fairly rapidly too.
I love Haskell most for programming, by a long shot. There are a number of reasons. From a conceptual standpoint, it meshes much more nicely with our mental/theoretical models of our problem domain. You program [by saying what things are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming), not how to get them. The `=` in Haskell is the equality of math, not assignment of a mutable variable like in almost all other languages. A couple examples of this might be `factorial n = product [1..n]` or `dotproduct v w = sum (zipWith (*) v w)`. Such cute examples only vaguely gesture at how real world programming proceeds, but they are illustrative. Besides being a much nicer conceptual framework, programming without (or with as little as possible) mutable state does wonders for one's ability to maintain a project over the long term, and to understand what is happening when the complexity gets large.

Having a much more powerful type system than any other language is another huge bonus. It's like programming with a very intelligent assistant. A huge majority of the mistakes you can make are caught at compile time. And you can extend that power to leverage it for your particular domain in a lot of ways. One example relevant to this subreddit is the ability to statically enforce correct dimensional analysis, for example as implemented in the [dimensional](https://github.com/bjornbm/dimensional/) package.

Looking forward, I'm excited by the prospect of dependently typed languages, which gives you the power to do arbitrary formal verification of your program at compile time. This is very nice, for one example, to enforce things [like dimensions of tensors and matrices](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/master/libs/contrib/Data/Matrix/Algebraic.idr#L86-L89) when doing any kind of matrix computations. Languages built from the ground up for this approach, like Idris, are especially nice, but a lot of this is being brought in to Haskell as well, which is good because we already have a fair number of libraries written in Haskell.

We don't currently have the kind of mindshare devoted to making awesome scientific libraries as say Python, but there are a lot of [basics in place](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix), and I'd love to help try to move that needle, and encourage others to do the same.
My favorite language in general is still Java for its logic and robustness in big projects. But it's not very suitable for scientific applications, for which I use Python.
Fortran.

Modern Fortran is unbeatable for maths. It's also got everything you need to make dynamic data structures, full OO capabilities, coarrays for native parallelisation, OpenMPI support in all compilers, CUDA in the PGI compiler, and C interoperability for CUDA if you don't have the PGI compiler and want to use CUDA. It's also syntactically easy to grasp.

It's only missing templates from C++, but you can emulate them.
Bash is my shit. Pardon the language. However, I use quantum espresso for my research and bash is a very sensible language for me. Not too hard to figure out, and nothing seems unreasonable with regards to callable functions. 10/10 would recommend
Python for sure. Easy to learn, no declarations of variable type needed. Very useful for the protein dynamics research I've done in the past
Y'all make me feel old.  I started in C, and moved to ASM/Hex for a few projects.  I actually enjoy Assembly, and the speed of it is unmatched by any "modern" language.

I do a lot of work in C/C++ now, I like the multithreading, and the CUDA support is phenomenal.
The lack of Java is surprising. 
I use MATLAB as I have a school license, and I can produce plots of complex equations in less than 30 seconds
I *like* Python the most, because it's so easy to use. Not just the process of writing code, but I like how I can just run the code without having to compile it. Its big drawback is that it's slow. Fortran and C++ are necessary to do lots of low-level computations quickly, and both of them are commonly used by physicists. But you can still use Python for high-level stuff, especially for making plots. (matplotlib is the best!)
Different languages are meant for different things.

I need performance, so C++ I'd what I mostly use.
I'd probably like to use something safer like Rust, but have not seen enough high performance computing sxamples. It may be good for browsers, but getting a PDE vectorized and running fast is a different problem.
In an ideal world I might use something like Haskell but as it now stands, it's basically useless for HPC.

If I'm shuffling data around using some existing library, Python is nice and interactive. Well, not exactly nice as the syntax was never designed for physicsy or engineering applications, but it's the best currently available thanks to the big community. Matlab has a superior syntax and was built for engineers and Julia being essentially an open source alternative to the language is quite interesting (Octave is not really a language of its own but an open source replica of sorts, but due to the inherent restrictions is never quite as good, fast or polished as Matlab).
Groovy.  Java tidied up.
Python for analysis and proto-typing, Fortran for big ass fucking simulations. 
I mostly use python but I've been using R a lot lately. Doing Astrophysics in R it's nice since its fast statistics functions are very useful to deal with a lot of tabulated data. It's slower than even python though.
C++ or Java depending on what I'm doing. C++ gives you more freedom but java is built better. 
I'm divided between c++ and python.

C++ parallelizes without too much trouble, runs on everything natively, and is FAST if you know how to write it for speed.

Python can be written in the blink of an eye, has some really powerful and accessible libraries, and good visualization tools (also in libraries). It's not nearly as fast for heavy-duty computation but it's definitely useful for smaller bits of code or for gluing together a program where the fast bits are in c++.

Matlab deserves an honorable mention, every time I use it I find it easy to write, and it compiles to c so it's reasonably fast.
Clojure because of [Neanderthal](https://github.com/uncomplicate/neanderthal) and composability. 
C#. It's features are powerful enough that it has replaced Python for all applications for me.
Wikipedia can actually be a good starting point - the wikipedia page on a topic will often cite some of the more important papers or books on a topic. Once you've identified some important papers and books, you can work your way backwards by using Google Scholar to find more recent papers that cite those papers.

Of course, there's no real substitute for just reading lots and lots of stuff - you know you're getting somewhere when the papers you're reading seem to consistently cite other sources that you've already looked at.

One thing to keep in mind is that you don't have to  understand everything in the papers that you read; a big part of literature review is being able to pick out what the important bits are and save the rest for later. Being able to do that comes with experience.
I'd recommend IEEE Spectrum or Physics Today.
Mathematical Physics is as rigorous as any other subject in mathematics. 
...huh?
Yes, proofs in physics are also rigorous. Take a look at electrodynamics, every step must be mathematically justified. In statistical physics, for example, you can prove things using approximations but that does not make them less rigorous - we usually prove things *in the thermodynamic limit* (large number of particles). That can simplify some proofs, for example proving the central limit theorem in the thermodynamic limit is much easier than proving it for the general case, but they still must be rigorous proofs. Think of these approximations as additional constraints.
If you call something a "proof" in physics, it better be completely rigorous. However, you also have derivations, arguments, approximations and estimations that can be a lot less rigorous. You just don't call those things "proofs".
do you have linux binaries? (also sourceforge is still a thing? ;))
I haven't looked at your code, so I don't know for sure, but doing a time-independent solver might be easier than you think.

Does your implementation have a discretization of the Hamiltonian operator in it (e.g. using equation 3 in the paper)? If so, you've done almost all of the work that you need to do to solve the time independent equation.

If your discretization is small enough (i.e. your wavefunction is a vector of length a few thousand at most) then, to get the time independent solutions, all you have to do is take your discretized Hamiltonian operator and throw it into an eigenvalue solver package. The eigenvalues will be the particle energies, and the eigenvectors will be the time-independent wavefunctions. I say a few thousand at most because, if it's bigger than that, your computer will take a long time to do the calculation.

I don't know what programming language you're using, but whatever it is there's almost certainly a good package for it. C++, for example, has a package called "Eigen" that'll do what you need.

Also, if you do things this way, then you can reimplement your time-dependent simulation to be highly accurate. Rather than approximating the time evolution of the wavefunction, you can evaluate it exactly: if you know the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, then you can evaluate its matrix exponential directly.

If your discretization is much larger than that, then you can still get some of the time independent solutions, but it takes more effort; you'll have to write your own eigenvalue solving algorithm. These are not too hard to do; you can look up "subspace iteration algorithm", which is a simple and effective method of finding the ground state eigenvectors.

This whole approach is called "direct diagonalization", fyi.

Edit: I'm also on linux, so i can't use your program :(

I hope you are somehow joking around. But if not, this is a huge cause for alarm. You should take it to one of your professors and ask for advice. I would also stand up to the grad student about his unethical behavior. Not only is that behavior counterproductive to science but there are other serious consequences that could permanently harm your career.
Editing data to give the "right" answer is a no no! Maybe run it by a couple profs and supervisors and see what they say.
This is *not* an ethically ok thing. Having a publication with doctored results will hurt your carrier a lot more than applying for masters with no publications. Talk to your advisor and the PhD student's advisor (if they are different people). If you get no traction with either of them, talk to the department chair.
Sounds fishy. I would say, consult with a professor or someone experienced. 
> TL; DR: Is it somewhat normal to doctor research papers to undo experimental errors - is this an unspoken but ethically ok thing?

Yes and no. When you're doing an analysis, you *always* do the analysis on data points. You never, *never,* **never** change the results of the analysis (which is what seems to be happening here). 

What you can do is exclude data points from the analysis if you have good reason to suspect that those data points are faulty in some way^\*. In that case, at the very least you have to mention that you excluded data points and why you excluded them. Giving the results of the analysis without excluding data points is also highly recommended and a good thing to put in the supporting information. Finally, doing an analysis with a certain expectation is always dangerous and you have to be fairly careful to make sure you're not just replicating your expectations.

\* One example from my own work pertains to a measurement technique in which a beam is reflected off a crystal and passes through an adsorbed layer on the crystal on the way in and out. We're only interested in the propperties of the adsorbate layer so we'll exclude measurements on spots where the reflectivity is distorted because in that case we would be measuring defects in the crystal instead of properties of the adsorbate layer. But you cannot do that without mentioning it.
I highly recommend Mendeley for sorting papers.

 Lots of good resources out there for sifting through papers (Science direct, researchgate, web of science) but when it's all done, you have pdfs. And Mendeley eats pdfs and spits out knowledge databases. 
Maybe a browser extension that easily lets you datagrab from graphs in papers. I've been doing a lot of datagrabbing lately by taking screenshots and uploading them to a website.
I like using Jabref and Overleaf.
Overleaf makes it so easy to work on a paper draft with other authors, amazing. And if I'm not on my usual laptop or PC, I don't have to worry about Latex installations etc.

Also, Onenote from Microsoft really helps me organize my stuff. I have my notes right next to my labbook and my research results as well as my literature overviews etc.
It's been really helpful throughout my studies actually. In the beginning I just scanned my lecture notes and excercises and put them in there, later I bought a tablet with stylus digitzer capabilities to just take notes directly into Onenote and nowadays I'm basically organizing everything via it.
I can't recommend some app like Onenote or Evernote enough, one of the most helpful computer applications around imo.
1khz is a pretty high pitch noise. This is just a case of induction.
For some reason Hüfner is using p = i hbar ∇ (instead of p = -i hbar ∇) which gives you [p,A]= i hbar ∇∙A and therefore Δ = (e/2mc) (2Ap + i hbar ∇∙A). 
Please define your terms when asking these kinds of questions, more information makes it easier for people to recognize what's going on.

The simplest reasons I can think of to cause a sign difference would be that -i = 1/i, or [p, A] = - [A, p]. But if you've ruled that out it then it *might* be that your book and the paper is using a different [metric signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_signature), if that's the case then you should be able to figure it out pretty quickly by checking the first few pages of the book (chapter) and paper, as there should be a short section detailing which conventions they are adhering to.
You may want to post on physics stackexchange. This sub is mainly highschoolers who just figured out how to use Newton's laws of motion.
Sounds like a bastardization of information theory...
Decoding Reality by Vlatko Verdal.
Shouldn't this be posted in the Textbook & Resources thread?
[80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/) has great information on how you can use your career to have a positive impact.
It seems to me that you know what you're passionate about. My hope for you is that you'll pursue your dreams with all of your time and energy, and be rewarded for your efforts. Physics is wonderful, and beautiful, and enlightening, and it can be a great career. (I love my work in physics.) But if it's not your passion, you should know that it's also extremely difficult. People who are successful at physics put in very long hours, can work for long periods without results, suffer at the mercy of funding agencies, changing political tides, and ineffective bosses and leaders. Even as a student, it can be much more demanding than other fields, depending on your program, so it takes quite a bit of sustained dedication to get anywhere where you can make a difference. If you don't love it, it will be a burden and chore. Plenty of people with degrees in physics go on to do work outside of physics. It's a great platform for learning about how to solve a wide variety of problems, and how to work hard to understand difficult concepts. I think it also looks good on a resume for whatever you want to do in the future. But my advice is: don't do it unless you *love* it.
Just an example of how physics can be used to protect animals, I recently read about a new optical spectroscopy technology that could tell between male and female chicken eggs, which could prevent the massive slaughter of male chicks.
The thing you seek does not exist.

Animal activism doesn't need or want physicists. Activism needs, well, activists, and then the support structure of organizers, lobbyists, managers, fundraisers, etc.

The "80,000 hours" link posted already is worth your time. I'd like to highlight in particular that one of their featured "success" stories is about a guy in finance who donates a ton of money to causes he cares about. This might not seem as fulfilling as working for the cause directly, but it's actually *incredibly* important. If, in addition to supporting yourself, you can completely support N>1 worker in the cause you care about, you've actually done more for that cause than you could have with your own direct labor.

(Also, there's this tendency to imagine that people who work in finance, or defense, or consumer technology, etc. are somehow "evil" while people who work for activist causes are pure and noble. Stop it. The only way activist causes function *at all* is the support of basically good people whose daily work is outside of activism.)
Well, in terms of areas of physics in particular, there are some areas of biophysics that focus on stuff like behaviour of large groups of animals and their interaction with environment; statistical-type stuff. Might be worth looking into if you're into conservation. A surprising number of non-physics biology research groups actually look for physicists, too, because we have numerical skills that a lot of them haven't taken the time to learn. Atmospheric physics does a lot of stuff with a focus on climate, which you might be able to tie into conservation as well. 

That's about all I can think of. Good luck finding your passion! 
Physics/Science Public Policy is a very interesting field that needs more activists working with local, state, and federal legislators. 
I wouldnt mind someone that doesnt want to make the dam bigger bc animals could get hurt but a the same time wants to shut down all nuclear powerplants and are against wind power because birds. Swiss politics...

But if you want to save the animals. Show the non physiscs. That not anything that has to do with atoms is bad! 

I suggest you to go into nuclear or similiar things. If someone has one that could lead to power supplies. 

Because the biggest change you could do to save animals is probably make the power supply more efficient and less dangerous.

And good luck!
 > I'm studying it because it's the lesser evil option to go when I decided to go into the university

There is zero "evil" about physics - or the other topics physics beat out.  Your suggestion anthropomorphizes physics, since physics pursues only the most basic understanding of our universe.

This is a mistake.

If there's any evil in science, then the matter is more about sketchy people who bring their flawed morality to a beautiful knowledge.


I'm studying at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and I also kinda lost passion for physics over time. I have thought about working in renewable energy technology development, which is not quite the same as Igualdad Animal but would be more close to physics and a way to make the world a better place.
You could try to teach!

Just tossing out an idea here: have you considered the medical physics career path?  It's not animals, but it's still meaningful.
You can join the protests to repeal newtons laws
Go to law school, though I'm not sure exactly what that tract looks like in Spain. You could also go to law school in the US. But lots of people with science background are desired in law because it provides a different perspective and the ability to understand science. Intellectual property is a huge one for this but really any area of law could use some science. And if you wanted to just go and be an advocate for something you believe in they are usually looking for lawyers to pursue those agendas.

Non-expert (I know more about information theory and less about physical entropy). Here's my intuition:

1) Define a canonical ensemble for "Discrete scalar field in a box". Assuming your field is ergodic* (otherwise you may have problems with defining entropy anyway), you can just let the simulation run for a long time and it will reach a thermal distribution; you estimate the density function of this distribution. (I can give technical details on how to achieve this)

2) Given the canonical ensemble, that is, the thermal distribution your field should follow, you can calculate the probability [density] of observing a certain state. This probability however is not related to entropy, it's related to another important concept in information theory called *surprise*. Please give [this answer](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/276694/the-entropy-of-a-conversation/276707#276707) a read. So if you think of your thermal distribution as a Gaussian, if you start "organized", you will be near the tail of this Gaussian, in an improbable state. The *surprise* will be high. As you evolve thermally, I belive the surprise should get lower and lower as your state approaches the center of the Gaussian distribution, and fluctuate randomly around a minimum.

I think the evolution of the surprise of the system is very useful and well-defined given the assumptions above. Calculating the instantaneous entropy seems hard to define, and may lead you into inconsistencies. I'll think about if it can be well-defined.

\*: I believe this happens if your box is at least a little "weird" -- for example, trajectories of billiards should be chaotic on this box (here's a [picture](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gDVb2.gif) for intuition), or the wave equation should be non-linear (most electromagnetic media are actually linear). Otherwise (say if it's a perfect square box), the fields might just be periodic, so a highly particular ("low entropy") initial condition will recur after a period T. In that case obviously the statistical assumptions associated with entropy are invalid.
Hard to tell.  What are the properties of this scalar?  Can you prove it is continuous and differentiable?  if so, maybe you could transform to a complex field and calculate from an integral over distributions in the neighborhood of a point.

If you want to use Stirling approx, maybe you could try LDDP:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_density_of_discrete_points

I'm just swinging blindly.
Can you calculate the specific heat?
Don't you need to determine the partition fhnction? 
Yeah it's stupid that some people don't understand dark matter is nearly proven fact, I don't see why funding is going towards astrophysics research outside of dark matter. The biggest offender is this Verlinde paper /s

No, I don't actually believe this. And sure, this sentiment might be semi-valid when targeted against non-physicists who spout nonsense, but that doesn't really add anything but a bitter attitude. But actual physicists with this sentiment towards other physicists just puts down opposing theories because "everything points towards dark matter." This is a dangerous sentiment as research should be open and not dictated by the popular opinion.
This is really just the new: "I have an idea about quantum mechanics.  What if...".

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html
Seriously, this should be required reading anytime a post shows up on /r/science or /r/space or whatever about some new theory that explains galaxy rotation curves. I swear, the arrogance of some people, you don't know anything about dark matter but obviously you know better than all the astrophysicists from the last century.

On a more positive note, check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Observational_evidence) for a list of current evidence for dark matter. This includes not only galaxy rotation curves but also several more or less unrelated things like gravitational lensing, anisotropies in the CMB, structure formation, and the ΛCDM cosmological model in general.

The [Bullet Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster) is the piece that usually gets people.
In the past two months, there's has been a significant challenge to the dark matter paradigm in the form of the radial acceleration relation (also called mass-discrepancy acceleration relation). We don't currently understand why this relation exists. It hasn't been predicted. We don't know why dark matter should care about an intrinsic acceleration scale, and simulations haven't been able to decisively demonstrate this scale should arise. This is one of the reasons why dark matter has been featured a lot on the news recently, and why Randall made a comic about it.

Considering that the typical dark matter alternatives (MOND obviously, but also recent ones by Smolin and Verlinde) feature an intrinsic acceleration scale—and we have observed that indeed such scale exists—these alternate theories are completely justified from an epistemological point of view. It's not just crackpottery. Unless a detector observes a dark matter particle OR someone can explain how the intrinsic acceleration scale shows up in the dark matter paradigm, alternate theories are more than welcome.

Now, of course something that's annoying is when a philosophy major that knows nothing of physics comes and say "Epicyles! Vulcan! You physicists are dumb, you can't just postulate mysterious matter nobody can see just to save your theory!" Yes, those people can GTFO.
I always feel stupid when Randall calls me out for my amateur theories, but even stupider when I never even come to them at all. :/

And I'm on mobile so not sure if you linked XKCD or the comic directly, but if it's the former, here's the permalink for future civilizations who come across this post: http://xkcd.com/1758/
I'm on mobile and can't see alt text.  Can someone post it?
I don't see how writing a different field theory besides Einstein-Hilbert and making new particles are mutually exclusive. A modified classical GR with this extra field would have extra particles when quantized. In one interpretation you have extra fields with some nonvanishing texture and the other there are lots of particles to make said field. That is you either start with a Euler-Lagrange solution that is trivial for the extra field so you think you are lots of particles above the vacuum or you start with a different classical solution. I don't see a problem at this perturbative quantum gravity level. Of course I don't know what modification, so no calculation tried.
I thought that photo of colliding galaxies with gravitational lensing on either side of the visible matter was solid proof of dark matter?
I have a BS degree in physics and when am I going to be able to understand stuff like this?
Yes, it's funny. BUT we are natural scientists, so please try to avoid automatically dismissing a theory because it contradicts consensus. This has happened many times in the history of science and the majority look foolish in retrospect. Be highly sceptical of all theories that don't have a *complete* fundamental explanation.

... otherwise astrophysics risks ending up as "burn the witch" politicised as climate science. Even if consensus is correct, don't attack the oddballs. Even the effort of disproving their theories can lead to new insights.
How about different physical laws for different regions of space?
As someone relatively new to this sub and physics in general (undergrad who just declared a couple months ago) could you guys point me in the direction of some things to read on dark energy and dark matter that wouldn't be too over my head?

I saw OP in the comments mentioned "dark matter is the new aether" with a tone of dislike. Is this a common belief in the physics community? I've always kind of thought this way about dark energy instead; it seems to be kind of a cop-out. Am I in the minority on this? Or - maybe more likely - am I in a majority, but that majority is wrong?
Meanwhile,  in the Cognitive Sciences building ...

http://i.imgur.com/l1HuOgj.png
Ok I am a complete layman and don't know crap to start with, but could both the weird gravity we see ( extra pull ) and expansion be explained by gravitational waves? Sort of like where you have drops of water oscillating and they bounce around on the wave fronts?
Motto (translated):

*Not really interested in doing the science thing, we already know what's up.*

I like it! Defintely would watch something like that :D

Streaming a review of arxiv papers might work. Your audience would probably be limited to grad students (and maybe some undergrads) in the same field, though, so it would take some work reaching out to get people involved and watching. 
Interesting, saving to read tomorrow
Great initiative! 
This is a really neat idea. I tuned into the livestream yesterday and was quite entertained. 
I propose a live streaming of attempts to read a paper written by Witten, maybe with 5 or 6 of our heads put together we will form a single functioning theoretical physicist :D
I have a physics theory that is stuck in my head. If I am correct then the implications are massive for cosmology and theoretical physics. I shared it with my parents yesterday and, after a great deal of strain and explaining simple concepts like photons, they started to get it and I found the explaining process helpful. 

I have thought about live-streaming my theory and then creating a video rather than trying to get published. How next-gen would it be if the next big theory was revealed in a live-stream? 

Do you think people would be interested in listening to a random dude's physics theory? (I will give a brief description below.)

One way to design a twitch channel might be to have a panel of physicists and let people call in with their theories and have the panel assess the potential of each theory. 

I used to watch TheOddOne, then Reynad, then Strifecrow. What games do you watch?

Theory

According to my internet research, The universe is expanding but not like the explosion of a hand grenade where all the things come out from the central point. Rather, empty space is continuously being created (or coming into being) between the things. Our galaxy appears to be at the center of an explosion outward due to the fact that all things (on a cosmological scale) are red shifted but that is an illusion and the reality is that everything is sitting still and space is appearing between the things. 

Our galaxy is essentially at rest with respect to the CBR. We assume other galaxies are at rest with respect to the CBR and that the red-shifted light we see from distant galaxies and quasars has been expanded by the universe and not a Doppler shift. 

If I understand the situation correctly, there are some interesting implications for cosmology which I would love to explain to a group and explore as a group. 

How possible would this be?


Another idea might be to just pick a topic and discuss it as a group so random people can invite their friends and parents to get their minds blown. For example, you could make Friday "Wave Motion" day and talk about light interference, how a prism breaks a white beam into a rainbow (and how rainbows work), and how resonant frequency took out the Tacoma Narrows bridge. 

Next week you could talk about valence electrons and how they influence the periodic table, how spectral lines help astronomers with figuring out the elements in a star or atmosphere, and how that impacts our knowledge of how celestial objects are moving.

I think that people who might fall asleep during a lecture might gravitate to a discussion where instead of learning about the ideal gas law through equations you describe it through the mechanics of a refrigerator. 

Possible Physics Streams: 

1. Topical discussions with the whole community lead by one to five leaders. 

2. Theory streams which emulate Dragon's Den where people share their theories and receive feedback about the viability of the theory. 

3. Topical homework help streams where a student might donate $1 - $10 (depending on the demand) and get step by step instructions on how to solve the problem benefiting the whole student community. 

4. Topical lectures by experts who take questions and who have time to ramble on about the topic with less constraint than they might experience addressing students or on a Ted talk. 

Bottom Line: 

1. Who is running the stream? 

* How many people?

* What level of expertise?

2. Who is watching the stream? 

* Experts?

* Students?

* Interested non-academics?

* High math or low math? 

There are lots of interesting combinations that could serve a market if we could get a market developed. Frankly, this could be the future of tutoring. Let's get a bank loan and start up a streaming website targeting students at first but branching out into all forms of knowledge consumption as exposure grows. 

How much could aspiring writers learn from watching editors edit?

How fast would a stream about personal financing grow? 

The possibilities are endless. I love it. 
About classical phenomena, that's true. About quantum mechanics, it is not - which is presumably why the author explicitly says that interpretations of quantum mechanics are an exception.

The way he phrases it seems to imply that only "controversial" interpretations of QM are the exception, but I think that he probably meant that the interpretation of randomness in quantum mechanics is generally controversial. As of right now, nobody knows what the origin of randomness in quantum mechanics is, and it's the subject of much debate.

Fun fact: one difference between classical probability and QM is that Bayes' rule isn't generally correct for observables in QM. Quantum randomness is generally a different kind of thing from classical randomness.
>Is this the general consensus on this matter?

No, this is the opposite of the Copenhagen (the main) interpretation.
Except the word "controversial", it's more or less accurate. Interpretations of QM where outcomes are random (going by the name of Copenhagen interpretation and its various offsprings) are the most popular ones among physicists , and among experts on quantum foundations, so calling them controversial might not be too accurate. 


Actually by extension, since the entire world is quantum, in some sense the entire world is "actually random" (given that you believe in that sort of interpretation); but that's being very pedantic. 
No, it is absolutely not the general consensus. There is huge variance in whether the Copenhagen interpretation is correct or this stance is correct. And in any event, until there is a theory or test devised that can differentiate between the two stances, a firm commitment to either model is unscientific. It is more responsible to take a positivist (scientific positivism, as opposed to scientific realism) attitude and understand that these are all models for human understanding of quantum phenomena subject to future refinement and improvement.

Or, to put it another way, as someone with degrees in physics and philosophy, you will only ever find physicists who are ignorant of the philosophy of science taking a firm stance on which model is right. Because it is an unscientific position to take, but you have to understand the philosophy of science to understand why - basically, because there is no evidence that supports one model over the other, and "intuition" is not a sufficient basis for preferring one to the other. 
I reject the statement. It is foundational to modern physics that non-commuting variables are implicit to the wave nature of matter on a small scale. Additionally, chemical reactivity, bonding, spectroscopy- all these - are compatible with the Copenhagen interpretation. The stamens implies limitations in measuring result in a wave picture (random).  In fact, the uncertainty (wave view) is an inherant property of matter and energy. The veracity of the Copenhagen view is the fact that all od modern chemistry and condensed matter physics has been built on this perspective. That said, there are still unresolved issues that intersect philosophy but I say shut up and calculate!
the consensus is that quantum mechanics has randomness and there's nothing controversial about this. 

interpretations that claim:

>Presumably, if we had more information, we could exactly predict everything

are the controversial ones.

>We just use randomness to describe our uncertainty in the face of incomplete knowledge.

no. it's fundamentally random. not because we don't know better and that's our probabilistic estimate of something we don't know (like a survey/poll).

by transitvity you may well consider macroscopic behaviour to also be random, so i would also doubt that "nothing in the real world is actually random" (but only if you look close enough, not superficially).

The others seem to have focussed too much on the physical statement and too little on the implication.

That well-known book you are quoting is wrong. Quantum randomness effects experiential reality quickly. Certainly within months, and probably within minutes. The classical example of the Butterfly effect can be extended even further, so that a quantum perturbation now affects the weather across the planet in two to six months. And before you underestimate the weather, consider that that can, say, influence when people leave their homes, which changes the order of traffic, which changes when car accidents happen and to whom, which changes people's entire lives forever.

Therefore, no matter what knowledge you have of reality, you can't predict who lives and who dies five months from now: a single quantum-random mutation in the DNA of a fruit fly in Zimbabwe one week from now would change the answer.

The book is correct that randomness, as defined in Bayesian theory, includes uncertainty of the observer.
The double rainbow is caused by a double reflection with rain drops, which explains the ROYGBIV reversal.  

The vertical rainbow is a reflected rainbow (note the color ordering) most likely due to [multipath propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_propagation) of sunlight off of a nearby reflective surface, e.g., a cloud, a calm body of water, wet road, wet grass. 
Here is some more information on reflection rainbows.  Also look around the site for some other cool atmospheric optical phenomena.

http://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/bowim6.htm
Like /u/riboh said, the third rainbow is due to a reflected light source. 
That is where you find the pot of gold ;)
The video was much shorter than i hoped :-/ 
Couple things I spotted that are incorrect in this video. First of all "ITER" is no longer an acronym but is a Latin word meaning "the way," as in the way to clean energy. Secondly, the notion that we would mine the moon for helium-3 is pretty ridiculous. It would be much easier to build a breeder reactor that makes tritium on earth.

Also, the temperature required for fusion in a tokamak is much higher than the temperatures in the core for the sun. For one, the plasma at the center of the sun is much more dense, so the rate of reaction is higher, and the sheer number of nuclei allows for quantum tunneling that is less likely to occur with fewer ions.

This is the just a couple mistakes this video made, which is a shame since Kurzgesagt usually makes good content. Unfortunately, the prospects for fusion aren't great. Those in the business anticipate that optimistically economically competitive fusion power would be on the market by 2080. Right now, ITER seems like a last ditch effort for fusion. It's slated to go online in the next decade, and if it doesn't reach fuel gain, it could be the end of the quest for fusion.
There is a 3rd method to compress nuclei for fusion.  
[Focus fusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhKB-VxJWpg)  
It uses magnetic fields that compresses nuclei together towards a single focus point.  
According to the speaker it is cheaper to develop, but the current version needs relatively heavy atoms like [Beryllium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium). Its effects have been tested with cheap equipment already. I do not know the current status of this method.

Aren't all of the promises of fusion already available through thorium? We know it works and will be economical, why not invest in that? at least for a few thousand years. 
I think it kind of undermines some of the effects of fusion. In ideal fusion one glass of water would most certainly not create the same amount of energy as one barrel of oil, it would create much larger amounts of energy and if not explained that this cup of sea water would already contain the necessary components to produce this amount of energy, we might view it as the cup of see water and then some.

Beyond that the research in fusion has many other very vital pay offs, be it militaristic or commercial or fuel for other research.
I came to this sub to ask about this source! Is this a good source for explaining some of the basics of physics?

I'm not trying to pass a class or anything, I'm just curious and looking for an entertaining and accurate channel about the hard sciences.
Anyone who thinks it can't work is clearly ridiculous - we have literally trillions of examples.
[ITER is a massive waste of time and resources. It's already obsolete.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4&t=262)

It's already old tech. At least a generation behind on superconductor types, performance, and field strength. We could build a reactor *today* with it's only limit being structural strength; we can build new REBCO coils strong enough to contain plasma at pressures that become difficult to contain *physically*. MIT has the design ready, but we're dumping 10x the cost and 5x the time into a design from *last century* (ITER) that is nothing more than an experiment.
nice animations, but content-wise it's pretty low effort and only repeats the usual cliches about the technology, isn't accurate and doesn't offer any  real insight. i don't know what place this has on this subreddit or why it gets over 200 upvotes.

for actual insight read iter.org
No mention of quantum tunneling that's a little disappointing. 

I love Kurzgesagt videos
The video mentions that so far it takes more energy to create a fusion reaction than what it gives. Where does the difference go?

Love that DBZ reference by the way.
Reading QED by Feynman and loving it. Ive only taken high school science courses but this book...! Its the perfect amount of technical. Does anyone know anything similar? Besides other Feynman stuff of course
Sincerely recommend "An Introduction to Relativistic Quantum Field Theory" by Silvan S. Schweber. It's an older book but written extremely well.
I'm looking to expand and solidify my understanding of linear algebra. Can anyone recommend a good book at about a graduate level, preferably with a focus on applications in physics?
I don't know if I've seen this posted here before but this [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ0yBou72Lz9fqeMXh9mkog) channel has tons of mathematics and physics related visualizations.   I especially like the one on [Fourier Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r18Gi8lSkfM)
I last studied physics in high school. Recently started taking the Khan Academy courses. On vectors and scalars right now and it's making me realise the only way I passed high school physics was by mugging up equations...trying to understand them logically now as an adult is proving difficult. But super interesting and way more exciting!
Hi everyone, i'm a 6th form student who studies A-level Physics and interested in quantum mechanics. All i'm looking for is a good, solid resource to help my understanding to both the mathematical side to the topic, but also the theory aspect. I would love to know any suggestions of books, online resources (I study the 8.04 MIT quantum physics course and 18.03 MIT maths) or general tips for going through QM.
When I first saw this, the laws weren't explained.  It was fun to try and figure out which animated 'toon situation they were thinking of.  This one made me laugh the hardest.

>"Gravity is transmitted by slow-moving waves of large wavelengths."

Yup, as is clear from this experiment:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq_bjaI0NTo&t=8
I work as a researcher (postdoc). Religion plays no role whatsoever in my work.

I do discuss matters such as religion, politics etc. with colleagues. The vast majority of them are unbelievers, of course. A few of them aren't; it's no real issue and I don't recall nor have heard of there being any conflicts because of this in any physics research environment. Personally I find the claims of religions that I am aware of poorly justified and lacking empirical evidence.
I know some physicists who are religious. But all in all, I don't think anyone takes it seriously. I personally see it as a virus that is sometimes harmless but can easily mutate into the harmful crap we see today. When it does come up, it's usually exasperated discussions about how that fantasy shit has invaded our politics and threatens us. 

Ideally, religion tries to answer the "why" of things while physics answers the "how" of things. But you know, in reality, religions just can't leave it alone. So we should really treat it as the virus it is and rid ourselves of it and quarantine those who are infected until we cure them. 
The issue I personally have, is that religion is a system built on faith, whereas science is built on evidence alone. I personally believe that no good scientist should be religious, since that seems like a conflict of interest to me. To each their own I suppose.
Well, looking at all the postdocs in my departement i'd say they are too busy with work and math to think about god.
The probability that you would, subjectively, experience surviving the experiment would be 1 given MWI, and a lot smaller given Copenhagen or something similar. From the point of view of everybody else, or from the point of view of somebody with a God's-eye-view of the whole wavefunction, they would of course be identical. But the subjective probabilities are different.
I would characterize it as a bizarre (but grounded in scientific reasoning, not purely a joke) thought-only experiment motivated by an interest to know if the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct.  MIT's Max Tegmark has been one of the ones to talk about this idea.  I remember reading somewhere that Tegmark once articulated the idea to the legendary John Wheeler; it might have been in Tegmark's book *Our Mathematical Universe*, I'm not sure. I vaguely remember, but I'm not positive about this, that Wheeler didn't comment on it. Apparently, Tegmark has even (presumably jokingly) suggested that he "might someday try the experiment, but only once he's old and crazy."  [Here is an article about it](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5891740/quantum-suicide-how-to-prove-the-multiverse-exists-in-the-most-violent-way-possible) that discusses about setting up the "experiment", the probabilities involved, and the fact that the  interpretation, even if correct, would only be "proven" to some other-world surviving version of the experimenter.

Surely this would be a strong contender for first prize in a "Scientific Ideas Without a Practical Application" contest!  ;))  
It isn't a joke. If you are a physicalist (i.e. you think consciousness arises just from the laws of physics) who thinks the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is true, then you are pretty much committed to believing in quantum immortality. That is, if you don't believe there is some magic "soul" that is attached to only one of the many copies of "you" in the multiverse, then if one of the copies dies, there is still a copy of "you" that exists, and there is no meaningful sense in which you can preference one of the copies over any other. That is, you can't worry about which one is the "real you," because they all are the "real you." So from your perspective you will never die, since none of the dead copies can be aware of being dead; there are only the alive copies that are aware of being alive (this is just the anthropic principle). From the point of view of others (your friends and family etc) you will almost certainly die, but from *your* perspective, you will be alive, in one of the universes in which you survived. 
It's based on quantum superposition. A superposition of your particles will always exist in some universe. That being said I am highly skeptical of MWI
[You can measure Planck's constant with LEDs.](http://www.scienceinschool.org/2014/issue28/planck)
One of my favorites is using an empty soda can to demonstrate atmospheric pressure. It's simple to set up and surprisingly weird if you don'the know what'she going on.
If you have unused CDs still lying around your house, you can build a visible light spectrometer.
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhuxj/astro/html/spectrometer.html
It's really easy and you can use it to learn quite a bit about atoms and our light sources. It's really interesting to look at some lights you have at home and see how different their spectrum looks even though they all seem white to us.

If you want to go more indepth, you can build a reflection spectrometer this way. Shine a Flashlight using normal lightbulbs on an object and look at the reflected light with the spectrometer. You'll see how the red objects reduce the intensity of all other light but red etc.

You can also take a photo through this spectroscope with your smartphone and then have a bit of fun with analysing the data. (take the image into Photoshop/Gimp, cut out the relevant part and then look at the intensities of red, green and blue)

This stuff gets very close to feeling like actual research (of course on stuff that was already figured out a long time ago, but who cares if you're doing some awesome stuff at home).

Measuring the speed of light with chocolate and a microwave.
-You can use a laser pointer and a couple hairs to set up the (classical) double-slit experiment.

-If you have linear polarizers (in some sunglasses or 3D glasses) you can see how they remove reflections from windows at a particular angle (called Brewster's angle) and use it to calculate the refractive index of the glass (same for water or any other reflective surface). You can also sort of see the polarization characteristics of the sky; when you put on the sunglasses the entire skyline isn't darkened evenly because of a similar phenomenon in atmospheric scattering.

-An alternate way to find the index of refraction of water is to shine a laser pointer into it. Use a transparent container so that you can shine the light in from the side, and have it bounce off the upper surface from the "inside". This reflection only happens when the angle is shallow enough, and you can infer the refractive index from the critical angle.

-With an engineering bent, there are various tutorials online that teach you to make reflectors to boost the gain of a wifi or bluetooth antenna. With some beacon software you can see how the effectiveness of the reflector varies with its distance to the antenna and (hopefully, I haven't tried it in a realistic environment myself) see how the wavelength-matching condition strongly affects the signal.

-You can actually make your own cloud chamber and see decaying particles. A bit finicky to build, but doable.

-It's not hard to make your own motor with a battery, a magnet and some wire. Alternatively, make a generator attached to a waterwheel and use your sink to power an LED.

-Use a prism to split sunlight, and put a thermometer in the path of the spectrum. Note that the temperature goes up. Now place it in a spot beyond the red strip. It still goes up! Congrats, you discovered infrared light.

-Build a collection of pendulums on a common rotation axis, linked by springs at their base. Get to know the [sine-Gordon equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine-Gordon_equation) and the behaviour of solitons.
Fill a glass with a smooth top full of water. Take a sturdy piece of paper, press it against the top with one hand and flip the glass over with two hands. Make sure you are pressing the paper evenly while the glass is upside down. Then remove the bottom hand. The paper will hold the water in because the air can't get through and replace it. Practice over a sink or bathtub until you can do it. 
Not really an experiment but this is something that non-physics people find interesting. Find two identical things. Drop one from a height and throw the other one from the same height but horizontal to the ground. They will land at the same time. Tell them it's because the horizontal component of your speed never changes(minus air drag) and your vertical component is gravity. The distance they drop is the same so they are in the air for the same amount of time.
I'm about to enter my final year majoring in Physics and Applied Mathematics, and my goal is to enter astrophysical research. I have one extra unit spot in my final semester, and I can't decide between doing another statistics course (I did one introductory course in first year) or another programming course (would be introductory level C++, already had one course and research experience with Java). 

The faculty I have spoken to have recommended taking the Stats course over the Programming one, but I'm worried that my computing background is too weak. Given that I haven't had any experimental experience (and I'm not too comfortable with experimental anyway), not having a solid computer science background might be quite a detriment in the future. 

**Is taking a Stats course really more beneficial than a C++ course?** Without a solid CS background, I only have data analysis experience, and I don't want to be forced into Experimental Astrophysics. 
I won't be studying physics in school as I'm doing computer science, but I have always been interested in doing some reading on my own. So because I won't have a lot of time to dedicate to multiple things, what is the best branch of physics that will allow me to study particles, EMR, and quantum principles? I'm also quite interested in nuclear physics but I'd love to focus more on principles of light and radiation in general. 

Maybe I should be looking for a more general resource? Can anyone recommend a textbook?
How worried is the physics research community about the next four years in the US? Seems like a lot of discretionary government funding could be on the chopping block. I'm applying now for materials science PhD programs, and I get the sense that there is now more risk than ever in pursuing a research career.
since i have to choose a specialisation soon, which fields have a particularly high/low chance of finding a well paying job (in germany)
Posted this on one of these threads a few weeks ago but it was too late to get a response.

My undergraduate degree is in Discrete Mathematics and I am midway through a joint masters/PhD in Theoretical Computer Science where I could leave after the masters. I have done research in Scientific Computing and am considering  switching to this field (specifically Computational Physics) and finishing a PhD. As you may notice, my math background is not in an area that is typically associated with physics. Does anyone here have any experience coming from a similar background and going into physics or scientific computing in general? Any advice on this and materials to fill out my mathematics knowledge would be welcome.

Thanks in advance.
I am in the process of applying to grad schools, I have good grades (3.8 GPA, 3.7 physics.  Member of my school's honors college) and am doing ongoing research in stellar physics (no chance of publication this year, still too much to do), I think I did fairly well on the GRE (but won't know for sure until test scores come back).  I am also undecided on what my specialty should be but I have been leaning more towards cosmology.  What are some good schools I may be unaware of, preferably on the west coast.  I am fairly sure I will be applying to Boulder and Stanford (unless my GRE scores come back low).  Does University of Oregon have a good cosmology program?

Also, my bachelors has a secondary education emphasis on it and I will have 3+ years experiencing teaching physics labs and high school physics by the time I graduate, will this help me stand out among generic physics degrees and will this help me get a TA position?
Hello all, I am new to this subreddit.

I am a physics major currently in my final year of community college and will be applying to transfer for next fall. I am in the process of finishing the calculus/math and calculus-based physics courses at my community college, and I was wondering what type of classes I should be expecting to take once I transfer. I am currently interested in astrophysics, but am planning on a general or even engineering track.

I live in Southern California and will be applying to the UC's and Cal States. Any advice on private schools in California that have good undergraduate physics programs? I will most likely stay in state, but I am also interested in out-of-state schools.

Thanks in advance!
i need (finally) choose my specialisation: currently i have two option, one is to write my thesis in quantum information theory, it's something what i really enjoy, but still extremly is difficult for me. 
on the other hand is solid state physics with an application in nuclear physics. this option is more convenient and easier.
In summery: quantum information theory sounds more interesting, but it is hard, solid states is not like aren't interesting at all, but still not that interesting, but seems to have more applications and work opportunities. Any advice how to make this "hard" choise?

Thanks in advance.

I am getting a divorce and have a one year old. This has changed my plans from acedamia to now looking to enter the financial sector when I graduate. I have about 1.5 to 2 years left on my PhD. 

What should I do over my remaining time to make myself the most marketable when I graduate? 

I have a bit of experience working as a runner/clerk at the Merc when I was younger. 
Can anyone tell me if these numbers look right? They should be acceptance rates for physics programs in  various schools.

MIT and Harvard accepting ~10% seems a bit high to me 
I'm thinking about doing a Master's degree in France (UPMC specifically). If anyone here has experience with the application process from the U.S. it would be great to hear from you. Which university did you apply to? What were your credentials? Were the classes to be taught in French? How were you going to pay for it? 
Which are the best colleges/universities to study physics?
Typically you want to blow air at the chimney pipe just above the stove.  This gives you the maximum heat exchange and recovers some of the heat that would otherwise be lost through the chimney.
 
If you look up "wood stove heat exchanger", you will see a wide variety of contraptions designed to do just this.  That said, modern wood stoves often have a jacket with a built in fan for exactly this reason. If yours has the jacket but not the fan, try blowing air into the opening.  You can tell it is working if the chimney cools down somewhat (check with a pyrometer...not your hand)
Blow the fan at the stove. If you blow it away from the stove you run a marginal risk of heat damage to the back of the fan. But in general the best way to evenly distribute the heat is to put the fan in the center of the room blowing straight up at the ceiling.
This journal has a subreddit at /r/quantumjournal, and the board will be doing an AMA on /r/science next Monday.
To me is a good step. There will always be questions regarding the integrity and validity of methods and results but getting more information out there can only be beneficial, especially if those papers allow for negative/null results in science. A lot of my peers are afraid of publishing if it doesn't meet their funding criteria goals. If say, a group is going down one path and decides it's not successful they can at least point to publications in this arena to say to their funding committees we need to try alternatives.
You know you've become a physicist when you read the article and go "hey I've talked to that person"
This is strange. I have not heard of the Tully-Fisher relation before, but it makes no sense to me that dark  matter distribution should be so strongly correlated with the baryonic matter distribution (with the assumption of dark matter which only only have some weak interaction). Also do we know if this works with Dragon fly 44, the 99 percent dark matter galaxy?
The paper in [PRL](
http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.201101), and preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05917).
Yes, I believe this has been posted before (or perhaps in another physics-related subreddit), and some papers have been published in the last two months trying to explain it. The overall conclusion is that we don't know how to fit that with the current dark matter paradigm. We don't really know why this law should arise and simulations of galaxy formation haven't been able to decisively demonstrate it.

Modified Newtonian gravity (MOND) does match this to a T, but MOND has its own issues that have yet to be resolved (acoustic peaks mostly; the Bullet Cluster isn't that problematic).
For others like me who weren't certain exactly what the title was referring to when talking about the generic "rotation of a disk galaxy":

>McGaugh, Lelli, and Schombert have displayed a remarkably simple relation between the radial distribution of visible matter in disk galaxies and the radial dependence of the rotational velocity

...

>if you know the centripetal acceleration at a given radius expected from the gravity of the visible matter in the disk, you then also know the actual acceleration at that radius, even though in many cases it is mostly determined by the dark matter. The authors show that data for all disk galaxies fall on the same curve (see Fig. 1, bottom). Individual galaxies fall along different sections of the curve, depending on their disk mass and surface brightness. This remarkable relation includes galaxies spanning factors of 10,000 in disk mass and 1000 in disk density.
What even in the hell?
>Does any closed system have limited perturbations? And therefore a "God's Number" or finite set of lowest energy states?

No, there is no principle that generally limits the number of low-energy states a system can have. Systems with a continuous symmetry can have an entire infinity of degenerate ground states. The unitary three boson problem with zero-range interaction has an accumulation of 3-body bound states at 0 energy; there are infinitely many within any finite window of 0 (this is the famous Efimov effect).

>What is the relationship between the uncertainty principle and perturbation theory?

There is no relationship that I know of. What did you have in mind?
 Is a solved Rubik's Cube in a high or low state of entropy?

The solved rubiks cube has entropy S=0 because there is only one possible configuration of cubes to make that state.  That is not especially interesting though because every rubiks cube configuration has S=0, https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090117134943AAfWkQa.

Does any closed system have limited perturbations?

I am not exactly sure if I'm answering this correctly, but I think when your're saying closed system you may mean system in equilibrium.  In this case, the system's energy does vary by a small  amount from its average energy.  When we talk about perturbations though usually we are starting knowing the answer to  a simpler problem, and then if we just change the system a little bit (i. e. apply a magnetic  field), then we can approximate the new solution by slightly altering the known solution. 
Have you considered going in for help and asking your teacher/professor for an explanation?
Physics is theory/conceptual and application of those theories in real life. If you don't understand why something works the way it does then it may help to have your professor explain more and do lots of practice problems to get better.

You might benefit from this. I am not sure :

Why don't you just study longer?
Personally, I think you should study for more than a single hour for any class. I typically say that for every hour I am physically in class, I should study an additional 1.5 hours outside of class at minimum. Furthermore, when it comes to physics, I find it best to do assigned homework first and then try doing the problems at the end of the chapter. I also re-write all of my notes immediately after class.
Isn't that field incredibly competitive at the moment accepting 1/4 to 1/3 of applicants. Might not be the most secure prospect. 
This is my back up career if I get bored of academia! It's actually what I originally wanted to do my degree in but at the time medical physics wasn't offered where I was. May I ask what country youre in and how difficult it was to find a position? 

Edit: by back up career I mean second choice. I only chose the phd over a medical physics masters for financial reasons.
I plan on studying medical physics soon! Currently in my third year of my BS in Nuclear Engineering. I have shadowed a clinical physicist and have spoken with many people in the department at my university and am positive this is the career for me. I would appreciate some more information from you about how you got into the field and graduate schools as I am going to be applying soon!
One thing to note is that in the canonical ensemble, one does not assume that *every* micro state is equally likely, only that microstates which all correspond to the same macrostate are equally likely. From there it may be a little more clear how non-ergodic systems arise. 
It's a fairly broad question but Ergodicity breaking is one of the main mechanisms of a phase transition.  Essentially you have states of the same energy and yet the system has no means to move from one to the other and accessible phase space gets fractured/split-up/divided.  The cause of this is a spontaneously broken symmetry:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking


This paper says chaotic motion drives ergodicity, so it may depend on if the system becomes chaotic as time passes.

For the stat mech, I had a professor who was pretty in to discussing the validity of this assumption, the law of equal a priori.  The closest thing we got to proof was the H theorem, which is basically a proof that it works for single particle systems.

First, a warning.  I was planning to do exactly this.  Now, I teach mathematics.  I'm still not entirely sure how that happened.

You will almost certainly take courses in abstract algebra (groups and fields are each very useful) and real analysis / measure theory.  Make sure to take a course that gets into functional analysis as well (Hilbert space and things which behave similarly.)

I probably don't need to tell you that courses in differential equations or in numerical analysis will be helpful.

I wish that I had taken a course in non-euclidean or differential geometry, but it kept being cancelled for low enrollment, so I can't tell you more on that, unfortunately.
The following is from the perspective of a string theorist, so it has a certain built in bias. Differential geometry is for sure very useful; both the basics (manifolds, Riemannian geometry, bundles) and certain more advanced things as well (like index theorems, symplectic structure, complex structure, characteristic classes etc.). Group theory and representation theory of groups is also fundamental, especially Lie groups and Lie algebras. Some basics of differential topology and algebraic topology is also useful; one should know about homology, cohomology, homotopy groups and so on. 


I don't think functional analysis is that useful beyond the very basics; it never really shows up in theoretical physics. Same thing about real analysis, and about studying ODEs/PDEs. You should know the basics about these things but a full upper-level math course is probably way overkill for most of theoretical physics. Theoretical physicist usually just assumes that things work and that your objects are nice, exists etc., so a lot of the things that mathematicians study and care about in these areas are just ignored when doing physics. Algebraic geometry is another topic that does have a lot of uses in string theory, but it's for sure not something that you need to know. 
It really depends on what kind of physics you want to get back into. For the most part, the curse of the math classes is that you can get a much clearer understanding of what's going on in physical theories, but basically none of it will give you tools that you can actually use in your work (unless you become a mathematical physicist). Basically all mathematics classes above the introductory level rely on a proof-theorem structure. The tricks and tools that they teach you are the things you need to prove theorems. But proving theorems is not what we do in theoretical physics. Most of what we do is actually solving models, inventing tricks that let us calculate things, etc. Just to be clear, I'm doing a PhD in AMO theory, so that's where my bias will be. 

Differential geometry really only comes into play if you're doing high-energy physics (maybe), General Relativity, or physics beyond the Standard Model (String Theory included).

I agree with what /u/hopffiber said about Functional Analysis and Real Analysis. You need to understand a bit beyond the basic level, if you're going to actually understand what's going on in quantum mechanics or non-linear dynamics. But it basically never comes up in our day-to-day work.

Complex analysis is very important. We use it all the time. I've ever used some of the stuff you might not see until a graduate course, like Weierstrass Products. 

Groups and their representations come up a lot. This include both the finite groups, which come up in a condensed matter and AMO context, and the Lie groups, which are everywhere. Mostly though, we care about things that are a little different from what mathematicians care about. Particularly, much of physics works with representations of non-compact Lie groups and that theory isn't always wholly covered in math classes (it isn't exactly the easiest case).

Asymptotic analysis, perturbation approaches, etc. There is a whole range of theory about how to apply powerful approximate techniques  to solve problems. Not every math department will teach them. Here I'm talking about regular perturbation theory, singular perturbations, multiple-scale analysis, uniform expansions (like WKB theory), asymptotic expansion of integrals (Mellin methods, steepest descent, stationary phase, etc.), etc.

Fourier Theory / Harmonic Analysis / theory of distributions. This stuff comes up a lot in quantum mechanics. You don't have to know how to prove a lot of theorems, but it is helpful to understand exactly what's going on when you say 'scattering states are normalized to a delta-function.' You get some better handle on what space quantum states actually live in (because it's only a true Hilbert space for bound states). And it's also important because you need to know all the tricks for how to calculate Fourier Transforms and such.      
let's see, mostly: differential geometry, functional analysis, partial differential equations, something about lie algebras too, pops up everywhere; something with the adjective symplectic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold

(a mathematician will likely do some of those still in a bachelor programme but not all of them and will likely do the rest in a master programme, if he specializes in this. source: did a double, math physics).
My recommendation would be to learn (advanced) numerical methods. That will help you in many different fields of physics and is also going to be useful for you after grad school when finding a job.

If you're looking for something more pen-and-paper-ish it depends on what field of physics you are interested in; other comments have some suggestions.
You definitely need to get some QCD under your belt. As you've just started grad school, I'm assuming you won't need to dive into the belly of the beast, so any introductory course on particle physics should be sufficient. 

I like Aitchison and Hey Vol 2, Quarks and Leptons by Halzen+Martin, and maybe Gauge Theories by Quigg for a very concise but clear introduction. Read up on Spontaneous symmetry breaking as well, which should be covered in any of those, and then you should have at least a working knowledge of QCD.

Then you can jump right into it, I think this is paper a good starting point: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.3937.pdf

As a sidenote, I would stay clear of the big hitters such as Peskin and Schroeder or Schwartz for your first introduction. They're great for a second pass over the subject, but can be confusing if this is your first exposure. 

The QGP is very confusing in nature and experimentally it is a mess. For example all the "jet quenching" results from BNL's star collaboration circa 2003 are wrong. The suspect disappearance of these jets in Pb-Pb collisions appears to have been a combination of  experimental and basic modeling trouble.

Unfortunately these results were hyped up and they have been widely disseminated butt this errata has not. So be careful with any early claims relating to jet physics.

Nobody really understands the QGP and we really don't know if it has been observed .

Zeptosecond precision when the smallest time interval uncertainty is 12 attoseconds, so it can't actually be verified. Top kek.
rotation curves are not the primary evidence for the existence of non-baryonic matter. Large scale structure, BAO, CMB power spectrum, bullet cluster, apparent flatness of the universe and the implied density, are more stringent constraints that span broader physical scales 
A relativistic correction can at most go as (v/c) (actually you can show in this case it's at least (v/c)^(2), but it doesn't matter). The correction due to dark matter to the rotation curve is very large, of order 1 (after a certain radius, the real curve and that predicted by baryonic matter only are completely different).

Thus, since v << c (in fact v/c ~ 1/2000 for typical galaxies), this or any other relativistic corrections cannot be it.
/u/schrogendiddy is right.

Also take a look at the [Virial Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virial_theorem) which may help clear some things up.
Can you post it in the original language as well?
Thanks, I really enjoyed this little story and admire the charm of the teacher's spontaneous poetic reply. 
At the end of the nineteenth century, Kelvin stated that the only task remaining for physicists was to make "more and more precise measurements".

Only thirty years later, we discovered quantum mechanics.

There is far more that we don't know we don't know than there is that we know we don't know.
A physics book I chanced to review from the 19th century predicted the imminent end of optics.

But then the author missed out on materials and lasers and such
Tinder for the spark...like building a fire, not timber.


Hopefully that's autocorrects fault and not what the guy actually said.
Just for posterity, how did it sound in the original?
Physics will continue.  Whether there will be humans around to study it after this election is anyone's guess.
Jesus that's beautiful.  

That kid probably hasn't read enough physics to see that every time we think we're close we open another rabbit hole. 


Funding might end.

Someone once said in the early 1900s that physics was solved and nothing more was needed except more precise measurements.

Then 1905 came along and out popped special relativity and the photoelectric effect (leading to QM).
Was it in Urdu?
There is a story about Max Planck, when he couldn't decide what to study somebody told him to go into biology or some similar science, as physics is done and the only thing left to do is to improve measurements of constants and such.

That was at the end of the 19th century and we all know how the story ends.
The original verse is by one of the greatest modern poets of Urdu and Persian, Sir Muhammad Iqbal, the ideological father and national poet of Pakistan. 


Also, what a terrible analogy!  Philosophy hasn't had a lot of progress compared with sciences.  From Kuhn's viewpoint, they are pre-scientific with schools of thought in many branches.
Some time ago, I was a GSI for a lower-division physics lab section. An undergrad in my class was surprised to find out that I was a physics graduate student, *actually studying physics.* She said, "Really? What is there left to know?" In all seriousness. I'm not as poetic as your professor, but I managed to say something along the lines of, "Really. We've only just scratched the surface."
Awesome reply, we need more such kind of people. Can you post it in original language, as I see a lot of people here want to read that.

Delaying a class has zero impact on your career, especially on that sounds like an intro. Short delay in graduation? Maybe. 
I'm not a physics grad but i have some general advice for you. If you feel like you won't have enough research experience for a phd, then you can consider going a masters first, to test the waters(so to speak).
Talk to your academic adviser.  This actually happened to me with differential equations.  I absolutely needed it that semester because I would follow it up with courses taught once every other year.  My adviser talked to the course instructor and added a seat for me.
Run this by your academic adviser:

Can you take your calc based Physics 2 course over the summer?  Perhaps your community college can help you out with that - just make sure it'll transfer in (I don't see why it wouldn't; Physics II is pretty consistent).

My local CC offers plenty of 100-200 level courses that transfer to most every SUNY school as is (I'm in NY).  I took a few math courses there during summer sessions to lighten my semester load.  Made a big difference walking into my Math Methods of Physics class having already taken Linear Algebra and Diff. Eq.
A interesting video about a topic I have been working in for the last few months.

An interesting note to this video is some topics are far from modeled correctly (with high enough accuracy to be in practical use). For example it is still very hard to predict [Sediment transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment_transport).
First, quantum mechanics is not at all like a low-resolution monitor. QM is filled with continuous values at the very mathematical level (i.e. the amplitudes) and, at least for now, in its application to physics (e.g. positions are represented by a continuous vector space). It is not at all indicative of graininess. In fact, before quantum error correcting codes were discovered, people used QM's *lack* of granularity as an argument against quantum computers ever being practical. Plus, making a classical simulation more efficient by throwing in QM is quite possibly the worst optimization I've ever heard of. QM is super expensive to simulate.

Second, inference requires a wonking huge difference in conditional expectation, or repeated independent tests, to get anywhere near certainty. Do you expect that the "ground floor" universe has *really truly* continuous values? Put odds on it. Keep in mind that e.g. Richard Feynman was bothered by having to cancel out infinities in electromagnetism in the continuous limit and suspected that the solution could be a fine-graining of some kind. Now put odds on how likely it would be for a simulation to be granular. We do try to do continuous simulations sometimes, by the way (e.g. turning the game of life into [smoothlife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJe9H6qS82I)), and we can at least write computer programs that converge on the continuous case. And if the ground floor reality is really truly continuous in a noticeable way, there's all the more incentive for the simulations to have that property.

Let's arbitrarily call our prior for graininess given that we're on the ground floor to be 1:2 against and our prior for graininess given simulation to be 9:1 for. Also arbitrarily assume that we're totally unsure if we're on the ground floor or not: we put the odds of that at 50:50. Suppose we find out definitively that the universe is grainy. We do a Bayesian update and find that our posterior odds are... 10:27. Our initial 50% chance of ground floor was reduced to... 27% chance of ground floor.

Recall that 538 predicted "only" a ~28% chance of Trump winning the presidency.

See the problem? Even after you find out the universe is grainy, there's still too much uncertainty about whether or not we're in a simulation to really call it. And we only get to be surprised by the graininess once! We can't just keep checking it again and again to push the probability further. We'd have to find *dozens* of other *independent* predictions with as much difference in conditional expectation as the graininess to get to the 5 sigma standard in physics (e.g. with a simulation you'd expect reality to be planet-sized instead of billion-frickin-galaxy sized). And I just don't see us finding that many independent things to check unless we find ourselves literally hacking into reality and reading off the code bit by bit.

Overall I guess I'd say: anyone who thinks finding out reality is granular would prove we're in a simulation either doesn't understand Bayesian inference or is tragically overconfident in their assumptions about what's going on at ground level.
In my opinion this question "can science prove/disprove the simulation hypothesis" suffers from many of the same problems as the often debated question "can science prove/disprove the existence of god?" How is the idea that we live in a simulated world created by a programer (or team of programers) that different from the idea that we live in a world created by a divine being (or team of divine beings)?

The one difference is that we know that numerical methods introduce errors due to the approximations that are made. The problem is different methods introduce different types of errors, and these errors often look like different physical phenomena. For example the truncation errors used in finite difference methods can introduce artificial dispersion and dissipation. 

If we go looking for evidence that we live in a simulated universe, then i suspect that we will eventually discover new unexplained phenomena that is consistent with some type of numerical method. But we don't have a good to distinguish if phenomena is an artifact of the numerical method or some undiscovered physical prosperity of the (un-simulated) universe.  
Depends on the nature of the simulation and the assumption you make about reality. 

One common assumption about reality for example is that it is isotropic, meaning it works the same in all directions. A simulation that works on a [grid](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/LineThroughSquareGrid.jpg) however would not be isotropic and moving along the primary axes works differently then going in a diagonal line.

The issue with that however is that those and similar anomalies could just be how reality works. We don't actually know what the real reality would be like from within a simulation, we would only know the simulation. So this wouldn't be a proof, but a good indication that the universe might be a little more weird than we assumed and make a simulation more likely.

The closed thing to a real proof would probably be figuring out exploits and bugs in the simulation that let you have a look at the underlying structure of the simulation itself. The  most dramatic would be an "Arbitrary Code Execution" exploit, see for example [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB6eY73sLV0) where somebody is writing a Flappy Birds clone by playing Super Mario World. Downside of that is however that the simulation might crash in the process.

No. A sufficiently advanced simulation can interfere with your perception directly and individually. Any experimental result must in the end come into your brain through your eyes and ears and if these do not objectively exist then any result can be "simulated."

Round one, says no to simulation hypothesis 
http://phys.org/news/2015-12-holometer-theory-space-time.html

To me it all seems a little too well built, too large, too self recycling... looks like a great simulation to me. Making the connection to our understanding and limitations of computer simulations is a reach in my opinion.
I'm a student of his in Amsterdam, and some people from my university, including people who worked with him on the paper, wrote a nice (popsci, and Dutch) article on his publication:
http://www.quantumuniverse.nl/emergente-zwaartekracht-en-het-donkere-heelal/
One of the criticisms of Verlinde's 2011 entropic gravity idea was that it already ruled out experimentally by gravitationally bound quantum states of cold neutrons. I don't think this is addressed in the new paper (is it even about the same theory?)
ELI20?
Either way, a very good theory proven wrong is still a step in the right direction. I hope to see a unified theory in my lifetime.
The interwebs are hyping this hard.  

Paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02269).

Breif ~4 minute [video](http://youtu.be/Zy3n121FwYA) with virtually no information in it.
If I understand correctly this is a static solution? I.e. it explains todays universe.

So not an alternative to the Lambda-CDM yet?
I don't mean to be condescending, but is there a reason why this paper is getting so much media hype just a few hours after uploading?
Looking forward to this, especially if he addresses the experiments that seemingly disproved the paper. I've always hoped that the theories of dark matter would prove to be incorrect. 
I'll say the same thing I said on the [everything science thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/5bsne4/new_theory_of_gravity_might_explain_dark_matter/). This is interesting but not hype-worthy.

The reason that dark matter is the most popular model is because the modifications of gravity we have are all unsatisfactory in some way. They usually fall into one or more of the following categories:

1. The theory is not extendable to relativistic situations. (E.g., MOND)

2. The theory does not match all observations. (E.g., naive f(R) gravity, massive gravity)

3. We have been unable to show the theory can be formulated as a well-posed initial value problem, meaning one cannot use it to take information and make a prediction about the future. (E.g., higher curvature gravity or massive gravity)

4. It has a profoundly uncomfortable implications such as a loss of causality or if covariance. (E.g., ether theory or Einstein aether theory)

I should also add that many theories of modified gravity are motivated by a desire to understand quantum gravity. So this is not the first "from principles" approach. And as the article states this is one reason to study modifications of gravity.

But for those of us in the community, there are is a veritable zoo of models. An extra one is interesting but not necessarily cause for celebration.
Lee Smolin recently published a similar paper ["four principles of quantum gravity"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01968) which noted that MOND can be constructed from quantum gravity. MOND doesn't explain a lot of things beyond galaxy rotation curves (as far as I know) but it's interesting at least.
Many comments have mentioned the bullet cluster. Can someone post a short summary of it's significance?
The last section of the paper, for those interested:

"8.2 Emergent gravity and apparent dark matter in cosmological scenarios
In this paper we have focussed on the explanation of the observed gravitational phenomena
attributed to dark matter. By this we mean the excess in the gravitational
force or the missing mass that is observed in spiral or elliptical galaxies and in galaxy
clusters. Of course, dark matter plays a central role in many other aspects of the current
cosmological paradigm, in particular in structure formation and the explanation
43
of the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background. In none of these scenarios
is it required that dark matter is a particle: all that is needed is that its cosmological
evolution and dynamics is consistent with a pressureless fluid. In our description
we eventually end up with an estimate of the apparent dark matter density that in
many respects behaves as required for structure formation and perhaps even for the
explanation of the CMB spectrum. Namely, effectively the apparent dark matter that
comes out of our emergent gravity description also leads to a gravitational potential
that attracts the baryonic matter as cold dark matter would do.
However, the arguments and calculations that we presented in this paper are not yet
sufficient to answer the questions regarding the cosmological evolution of our equations.
In particular, we made use of the value of the present-day Hubble parameter H0 in
our equations, which immediately raises the question whether one should use another
value for the Hubble parameter at other cosmological times. In our calculations the
parameter H0 was assumed to be constant, since we made the approximation that our
universe is entirely dominated by dark energy and that ordinary matter only leads to
a small perturbation. This suggests that H0 or rather a0 should actually be defined
in terms of the dark energy density, or the value of the cosmological constant. This
would imply that a0 is indeed constant, even though it takes a slightly different value.
A related issue is that in our analysis we assumed that dark energy is the dominant
contribution to the energy density of our universe. According to our standard cosmological
scenarios this is no longer true in the early times of our universe, in particular
at the time of decoupling. This poses again the question whether a theory in which
(apparent) dark matter is explained via emergent gravity would be able to reproduce
the successful description of the CMB spectrum, the large scale structure and galaxy
formation. These questions need to be understood before we can make any claim that
our description of dark matter phenomena is as successful as the ΛCDM paradigm in
describing the early universe and cosmology at large scales.
By changing the way we view gravity, namely as an emergent phenomenon in which
the Einstein equations need be derived from the thermodynamics of quantum entanglement,
one also has to change the way we view the evolution of the universe. In
particular, one should be able to derive the cosmological evolution equations from
emergent gravity. For this one needs to first properly understand the role of quantum
entanglement and the evolution of the total entropy of our universe. So it is still an
open question if and how the standard cosmological picture is incorporated in a theory
of emergent gravity. How does one interpret the expansion of the universe from this
perspective? Or does inflation still play a role in an emergent cosmological scenario?
All these questions are beyond the scope of the present paper. So we will not make
an attempt to answer all or even a part of these questions. This also means that before
these questions are investigated it is too early to make a judgement on whether our
emergent gravity description of dark matter will also be able to replace the current
particle dark matter paradigm in early cosmological scenarios."

The paper appears to be a very long argument about how the entanglement/entropy of space is displaced/evacuated by matter, and this evacuation cause some kind of "elastic strain" in the entropy field (some kind of arguments about deSitter spaces). This strain then acts like a surface density about the original mass  (Eq 7.28), referred to as being like a "dark matter" density, which when integrated gives a the usual dark matter force.

I suspect this is a very long argument about how to derive an additional k/r potential around normal Newtonian matter.
A new [Sean Carroll article with an embedded 25-minute video](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/11/11/talking-about-dark-matter-and-dark-energy/) in which he talks some about Verlinde's new emergent gravity paper, entropic gravity (Sean currently works on that), the CMB analysis of acoustic oscillations, MOND, the paper by Sarkar et al on type 1A supernovae, and an homage to the [xkcd  cartoon](http://xkcd.com/1758/) about 'Yes, everybody's already thought of that!', all in the context of supporting DE and DM based on a diversity of observational evidence.


Good luck, buddy.
At the risk of sounding like an idiot; haven't we already observed the effects of dark matter via gravitational lensing? 
I didn't read the article but isn't the bullet cluster one of the bits of evidence that forces a dark matter particle in our gravitation theories.
So another top scientist claiming Newton and Einstein were wrong ... pffff not again!

Beyond the fact that it has an extremely sciencey sounding title, is there anything you want to add about the paper, why you find it interesting, what it adds to the current state of the field, etc?
The theories of a flat-shaped spacetime and constantly expanding universe may seem counter-intuitive, but there's a pretty good visualization that explains it: imagine taking an unblown balloon and drawing two dots representating galaxies right next to each other, then blowing the balloon up- as the balloon expands and stretches, the distance between the two dots increases as they are "Stretched" away from each other.

This is what it means when they say the universe is expanding, but isn't expanding "into" anything.
I made a post in /r/AskPhysics just a bit ago but I'm gonna paste it here if that's okay. Here is the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/5btaum/is_it_possible_to_generate_electric_fields_in_a/

>I'm working on a project that requires applying a 250 V/m electric field through some cells suspended in media. The purpose of the project is to see the effects the field has on the cells when a field is applied but a current isn't (no current can pass through the media).

>In order to do this, the proposed set-up was to have to aluminum foil plates on either side of a petri dish containing cells in cell media, and then connecting those plates to a power supply. The power supply would be turned on and a voltage would be applied across the plates such that the cells experience a target field strength.
I had spoken to some technicians at a company which specializes in measuring electric fields, (including the company's owner), and they had told me that the project was not possible. By applying the field, the charge in the media would polarize such that the net field experienced by the cells would always be zero. Is this true? Is it possible to apply a field to the cells without passing a current through them?

>Here is a diagram of the set-up: http://i.imgur.com/uiOyIa4.png

>We are currently using a DC power supply however we could switch to AC if that makes any difference, but the goal is to have the cells experiencing a 250 mv/mm field in one consistent direction.
Hi, I'm a physics major in the third year of my undergraduate. I'm looking at finishing my senior year and likely pursuing my masters degree in New Zealand, and I was wondering if anyone had any advice about physics programs at universities in NZ. I'm interested in research, specifically biophysics. 
Can anyone here give me an explanation of cross and dot products that differs from classic textbook definitions. I'm not asking someone to reinvent the wheel rather I'd really appreciate it if someone here can offer another perspective regarding the topic.
I recently stumbled across a theory called "Dispersive Extinction Theory" proposed by a guy who is a tenured professor in Tennessee who argues against general relativity, argues that spacetime is flat, argues against the Big Bang, and argues that the redshift that we observe is due to light dispersing through the medium of space rather than because spacetime is expanding.  

Here's the paper: http://web2.utc.edu/~tdp442/RedshiftEssay.pdf

Does anyone have any direct response or rebuttal to this?  Other than "It's a fringe theory", "It's extremely obscure", or "You might as well believe the earth is flat".
Hi, i am trying to get into quantum information theory. Any suggestion for thetextbook/articles to start for the undergrad-level?
I made a post in /r/AskPhysics a while ago and could not get an answer. I might just be dumb, but here it is:
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/5bvjpu/calculating_temperature_change_from_decompression/

*The contents:*

For the record, I have little experience with physics. I am pretty good with math.
I have a pipe, inside of wich there is a constant amount pressure supplied from one end (like a compressor). On the other, the gas (air), is free to leave and experiences decompression.
Knowing the temperature of the gas inside the pipe, as well as the temperature and pressure (1 atmosphere) when it leaves, how would one go about calculating the initial pressure? Would this apply to liquid (water) as well?
I am trying to cool water and air (separately) to -100C.
I tried using Gay-Lussac's law, but that assumes constant volume and pressure and volume. Using it, I was able to calculate that a simple pressure washer (5000psi) can cool to almost absolute zero (wich is wrong).
If you could be a lot more specific in the answer, instead of "look here" that would be nice.

*EDIT*

Here is what the setup looks like: http://imgur.com/a/G1jzY
It's more like a mathematical question, but what are possible methods to numerically solve an ODE where y'(y,t) is continuous, but the solution y(t) will (and must) be discontinuous (in a single point)?
So I have to write a basic simulation for a racecar going along a track, and I'm trying to figure out how I could write a vector-valued function r(t) that gives me the position vector of the car at any time t. I have the car's initial velocity, it's tangential acceleration, and the radius of the circular track. I've looked up plenty of resources about non-uniform circular motion but none seem to explicitly give the parametric equations I need. Sorry if this isn't the right place for this sort of question, but I've been googling around for a while now, and the best thing I've found is [this](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/FC/lc/motion/non_UCM/main.html), which isn't very helpful.
If someone who was planning on applying to Grad School this semester randomly decided to focus mainly on Canadian schools, what advice would spring to your mind?
Why not both? Or major in physics and minor in math, I had friends do that. many physics programs allow for math classes to be electives, that's a good way to get some of both
I'm doing both!
Do you like lab work at all?
[deleted]
Math. At least if you are in USA. I did research on this exact question week ago. After MA you can do PhD in physics still. 
There's a lot of overlap between the two, and typically math courses count as electives for physics and vice versa.  Do both!
to everyone mentioning the double major, Im a little late in getting my first bachelors degree so I want to finish it soon and not delay it. thanks for the suggestions tho 
If you're set on physics, I would do a math minor. It's usually just a few extra classes.
Why do you must choose one? Theroetical physics is real math!
are you curious about other sciences? 

do you enjoy numerical methods etc?
Por que no los dos?
Saw a quote that went: "fields, rather than particles, may be fundamental".  Sorry, can't remember where I saw it or who said it.  Anyway, would this idea be relevant here?
The kind of phenomena you describe (particle creation/destruction in the SM) are relevant to relativistic quantum field theory. Bohmian mechanics doesn't extend nearly as far as of today; maybe because noone managed to yet, or because it cannot be done.
Do not confuse the Bohmian particles as being somehow equivalent to the fundamental particles people talk about in quantum field theory. They are not the same.

No one has been able to present a terribly satisfactory relativistic version of a Bohmian field theory yet. If they did, however, the things we think of now as "fundamental particles" would be explained in that theory as some kind of emergent property of quantum fields (which is to say, conceptually nothing would change on this front). The electron and the quark and the photon and all the others would each be some special set of configurations of Bohmian particles that remain coherent over long time scales. Decays, like that of the neutron, would then correspond to such configurations changing from one to another. The important thing to remember is that the Bohmian particles do not 'carry their quantum numbers with them.' Things like angular momentum, color charge, etc. are properties of the wavefunction. So, the same Bohmian particles that comprise the up quark can also comprise the down quark, provided that the wavefunction is arranged in the appropriate way.

I don't think there's any reason in the theory for the Bohmian particles to need to be created or destroyed.
Bohm isn't saying its particles have to exist forever.  Just that while they exist, they always have definite positions.

Reddit is really on Bohm kick since that youtube video last week...
The Wiki article on the [De Broglie-Bohm Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory) actually does a really good job of explaining it (IMHO).

Particles come and go as they do, as described by quantum theory. No issues there.

"*So, at every moment of time there exists not only a wave function, but also a well-defined configuration (Q) of the whole universe (i.e., the system as defined by the boundary conditions used in solving the Schrödinger equation).*"

The greatest departure from classical mechanics is the notion that "*physical properties (e.g., mass, charge) are spread out over the wavefunction in de Broglie-Bohm theory, not localized at the position of the particle.*"

Keep in mind that Copenhagen and Bohm both agree on *observation*, but disagree on how to *interpret* what is observed. It's not a theory that postulates a *competitive alternative* to the Standard Model, but rather an *alternative way of understanding/looking at* the SM.
*Copying and expanding on what I wrote below.*

First of all, you need to be clear about what you want to say. Do you want a Bohmian quantum field theory? Or are you trying to make "ontological" sense out of the current QFT?

For the first option: The reason for the so-far nonexistance of a Bohmian QFT is that noone has been able to come up with a satisfactory relativistic quantum mechanics yet. QFT is inherently problematic for two reasons:

1. It only makes predictions in the scattering regime, where still each nontrivial term is divergent and the limit of the perturbation series is dubious.

2. It breaks relativistic invariance by invoking a Hamiltonian description which forces you to choose an equal-time hypersurface on which you do physics.

These problems could not be solved by now. As soon as a satisfactory relativistic many-particle QM exists, it will be child's play to make it Bohmian. This is done for all kinds of models all the time.


For the second option: Even in current QFT, it is not possible to give a dynamic description of these annihilation or creation processes which supersedes those from one-particle Dirac theory. There annihilation and creation are understood using for instance the Dirac sea description and can be made Bohmian.
I just found this browsing a 7 year old thread on this topic: [QFT as pilot-wave theory of particle creation and destruction](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0904.2287). It seemed relevant so I thought you might want to take a look. Though mind me, I haven't read the paper, only the abstract, and I'm not a physicist(yet), so I don't whether it will be of any help. 
It's regarded as unlikely but possible. People are looking for both spatial, and present temporal change in the fine structure constant. But it's not super high up on anyone's priority list, so there's not a lot of data so far. 
>  Now a second ULX has been found whose x-ray emission, being coherently pulsed, can originate only from a neutron star. That's because the all-important separation between a pulsar's rotation axis and its magnetic poles requires a surface, which black holes lack. 

This is a complete misapplication of the Kerr–Newman metric.  Regardless of the black hole "itself" requiring alignment, the black hole nevertheless does have a practical "surface", which would be the infall of material just around the event horizon.  And nothing prevents this material from creating magnetic fields that are not aligned with the rotation of the black hole itself.  Indeed, black holes themselves are NOT expected to have an important net electric charge, so any magnetic fields you see generated around a black hole are most likely not "by" the black hole.

>It’s not much of a secret that I’m a fan of non-local hidden variables (aka superdeterminism), which I believe to be experimentally testable.

How? What experiment could be done?
As ever the fanatical counter-point to this is found in [Lubos Motl's blog](http://motls.blogspot.co.uk/2016/11/weinbergs-new-calls-for-overhaul-of.html).
>I don’t think for example that numerological coincidences are problems worth thinking about – they’re questions of aesthetic appeal. The mass of the Higgs is much smaller than the Planck mass. So what? The spatial curvature of the universe is almost zero, the cosmological constant tiny, and the electric dipole moment of the neutron is for all we know absent. Why should that bother me? If you think that’s a mathematical inconsistency, think again – it’s not. There’s no logical reason for why that shouldn’t be so. It’s just that to our human sense it doesn’t quite feel right.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but this strikes me as a particularly silly thing to say. Mathematical "coincidences" are a pretty important way to make discoveries, or to confirm or disprove theories. The universe having no measurable curvature suggests that it either *must* be flat, or there is a mechanism that strongly flattens it below our measuring precision - this is a point in favour of the inflation model. I mean, if you're going there, you could start saying things like that Maxwell calculating that an electromagnetic wave should move at about the speed of light is just a coincidence...
Not totally pertinent, but Weinberg can also be a total self-gratifying asshole. I had his class back in undergrad, he straight up made a girl cry. 
Interpretation of QM seems lacking to me too.

If you see as "collapse of wave function" when as a problem, that seems to suggest experiments that try to challenge when this collapse is supposed to take place.

I think Dean Radins approach is misguided in trying to involve humans into it. But i.e. [this experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRSBaq3vAeY)([a pdf](http://www.deanradin.com/evidence/RadinPhysicsEssays2016.pdf) ) does try challenge it, seeing if the human becomes part of the experiment, if only slightly.

Using humans is silly, can wonder if an electronic circuit, computer or whatever can become slightly part of the wavefunction being collapsed. Then your sample size can be made larger much easier, and you can try if temperature matters.(if it does anything, i'd sooner expect it at lower temperatures) Can also try reinforcement learning. Of course, it would *appear* like the outputs don't do anything, but the idea is that they're ever so slightly entangled with aspects of the experiment, and that it'd learn ways to try make it entangled, and move the result.

As i have stated before, my money right now is on "one-wavefunction collapse" that defined the entire universe, and somehow implies local wavefunction collapse approximately. Tada!
It's interesting that he is not a big fan of the decoherent histories interpretation.  I had the impression that that was the cutting edge nowadays.

It only takes about 5 little tweaks to fix QM - got to start with the fundamental first - gravity, then move up to QM.  That is the mistake most people make.
No clue. Only thing I've ever been able to find are lists of piezoelectric materials from strongest to weakest observed interaction, and they're not very extensive.
What's a ddp? (sorry, google revealed nothing)
That's a false take on some work with surface plasmonics. Total bullshit title. Did you even read it?
Can we not. Please. I don't even... it's not even wrong

not really "opaque" then was it?
| My question is: how do we know that something is random/undetermined/just-a-probability without measuring it?

First, I'd like to say that I think you did a nice job in clearly phrasing the details of your question, especially given that you are a self-described newbie at quantum physics.

I suggest several readings that might be helpful. First, here is a journal article titled [Randomness in quantum physics](http://www.euresisjournal.org/public/article/pdf/acin.pdf) that covers a lot of the issues conceptually without getting into the complexity of the  underlying mathematics. It's an accessible read that may be a bit of a stretch but if you read it carefully, I think it'll answer a lot of your questions.

Another article is by Stephen Hawking titled [Does God Play Dice?](http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html)

Finally, I encourage you to do some background and supplemental reading branching out into some related topics - in other worlds, homework ;)) 

Do you have a background in classical physics? If not, I suggest you read up on the deterministic worldview that was the prelude to modern physics. For example start with,  [Scientific Determinism and Laplace's Demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon). 

After digesting stuff like the above, if you want more, note that a lot of historical background is covered in [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory) and in addition comments on the fact that while the standard [Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation) is non-deterministic and calculates the probabilities of observational outcomes from the wave function and the Born rule, there do exist alternate interpretations of QM that are deterministic, including the [Many-Worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation).  A take-away point is that after around 100 years of quantum mechanics history,  there is still a lot of diversity among physicists (and philosophers) on the interpretations of quantum mechanics. Note, however, that despite these interpretational differences, it has been supremely successful in calculating verifiable results.  

The wikipedia QM article from the [History section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#History) through the [Applications section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#Applications) might be of interest also, if you haven't already read it.

This is interesting, would like to hear an answer to OP's question.
You might get better results asking in /r/AskPhysics.

The typical example to use is a double-slit experiment, which I'll first explain in classical terms on a macroscopic scale. Imagine we're in a square room with a wall in the middle.  That wall is a solid barrier except for having two gaps in it. 

If we roll a ball along the ground toward the gaps, one of two things will happen. Either it'll hit the wall and bounce back, or it'll go through one of the gaps and continue in a straight line until it hits a fairly specific point on the other wall. Occasionally it might just hit the edge of the gap and go through at a weird angle, so theoretically it could hit any point on the far wall, but usually it follows something close to a straight line path. The ball is behaving like a classical particle: very simple.

Now imagine we fill this room with water, and we make a wave on our side of the room. Of course the waves will reach both holes. On the other side, those waves won't just continue like focused lasers in a precise direction like the ball did. They'll ripple out in circles, sort of as if they were emitted by those holes themselves. Moreover, the circular waves from the two holes will run into each other and interact, resulting in what we call an interference pattern. If a peak from one wave runs into the trough from the other wave, they'll cancel each other out. So the waterline along the back wall at any given moment is actually slightly complex and interesting. (If the waves are strong enough you'll get turbulence, but that's where our analogy breaks down.)

Now, physicists in the 20th century performed similar experiments on a tiny scale. They fired light, streams of electrons, and other things at a barrier with tiny slits on it, and placed a screen on the other side to see where the beam wound up. And the results were quite perplexing. Normally, whether it's electrons or photons, they saw the type of diffraction pattern they would expect from a wave passing through both slits. That wasn't so surprising for light--they already thought light was a type of wave--but it was pretty weird for electrons. In fact, even if they fired *one electron at a time*, they still got the same result: it seems to pass through both slits at the same time. Those places where the wave peaks from one slit meet the wave troughs from the other slit? The electron never hits that part of the screen, even if there's no other electron to interfere with it. (Well, very *rarely* hits that part of the screen; it's hard for the probability to be exactly *zero*) But if you block the left slit, or block the right slit,  the electron *will* sometimes land in those places! A crude way of saying this is that we are *forcing* the electron to take just one path of the other, instead of taking both simultaneously. 

What if we were to set up detectors at the entrance to each slit, so we know which one it went through? That destroys the interference pattern too. This goes to show there's no way of measuring the electron's position without changing its behavior.
I originally wrote this based on some discussions I had in /r/math, thanks for crossposting here!
Thanks /u/dethfire for posting this. I look forward to reading the current three articles in this series.

Coincidentally, I had just today for the first time come across some other articles by Arnold Neumaier, a professor at the University of Vienna.  I see that he maintains [A theoretical physics FAQ](http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/physfaq/physics-faq.html) which has a Chapter A8 with 17 posts on Virtual Particles and Vacuum Fluctuations.  

I had read in the past Professor Matt Strassler's article on [Virtual Particles: What are they?](https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/), which I thought was quite good, so I'll be interested in following up on that with Neumaier's articles.
Whoever wrote that has difficulty communicating. 

The content is there, but articulated so poorly. 

This isn't even a coherent concept, let alone a sentence:

>No one there will ever ask, how it can be that two virtual particles can bend as in a Feynman diagram with a loop and find each other exactly at the right place and with exactly the right momentum to annihilate.

The article is littered with things like that. 

The author seems to have a good grasp of the material, but needs a damn editor. 
Hopefully switching from engineering to physics!
Quantized my first field this week, I think I should celebrate this milestone 
Trying to introduce some high school students to modern scientific research. Pretty fun but exhausting.
Using simulations to analyze the orbital kinematics of satellite galaxies to the Milky Way in hopes to find some interesting things with LCDM at small scales. Now I just need some observational data to use...
Today the professor realized that literally none of the class has been following his lectures on inflation, but we all assumed that everyone else had been keeping up.
same as last week. the particle physics lecture is still my favorite over solidstatephysics and stat.+thermo.

we are basically done with our first report on the beta-decay experiment and are just working on a conclusion.

the second experiment was,quite franly, retarded as shit.

3 groups, 2 measurement devices. first the other 2 groups did their measurements and we had 2 hours to prepare a 5min presentation on some stuff we all had learned about while preparing for the experiment.

then we switched, gave the presentations afterwards and then started the real measurment, whit the data if it being send to us in a week.

another hilarious thing was the briefing on radiation protection...

we are determining the lifetime of muons...  "secondary muons", generated by cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere...

the next experiment will be "Photoemission spectroscopy" which seems to take a bit more work than the last two...

ill also have to start looking for a topic for my bachelor thesis, although im definitely going to the informations events of all the insitutes first. i am leaning towards paticle physics though.
Aside from applications, using simulations to model the formation and evolution of gas giants (i.e planets like our Jupitet). This is done in the context of exoplanets, where  understanding the formation process is critical in determining the mass of young (million to tens of million year old) gas giants 
Starting my Master thesis in theoretical perturbative QCD, still not sure what the topic will be exactly tho :7
Writing and finishing my bachelor thesis. Turned out the topic yielded way harder problems than one would expect, for example an equation of state that implies acausality. But where I actually failed was that the resulting functions of the ODE's I was integrating were discontinuous. Took me basically all my assigned time to find out why my solutions were oscillating...
Take home AP Phys C test. Free 100 yay! Haha it's on fairly basic stuff as its just the beginning of the year (Work & Energy Stuff), but it was much needed as I just bombed a test on Forces that there was no reason I shouldn't have gotten over a 95% on. Oh well, I'm new on this sub but I've loved physics ever since I was 9 or 10 (nearly 17 now), I've always watched videos and read articles on my own but it's so great to FINALLY start learning this stuff
I'm teaching math and sometimes physics as a private teacher. I hope to get more physics students/pupils soon. 
Detecting gravity waves using airglow emissions. Actually right now I am organising the bullshit that is the work of my predecessors... Seriously how can anyone continue when they can't even find the current version of the programs you are using! Or they are severely lacking in the comment department!
Just started reading through the Feynman lectures finally. It's actually a really good explanation of intro physics, and considering I'm halfway through physics C, I wish I read it sooner.
I'm working on compiling some code to work on a new SBC for an R&D project I'm on. I work in industry developing various kind of radiation detection technologies for commercial and research purposes.
Working with GEANT4 to simulate electron hydrogen interactions for a particle physics experiment. 
Doing mediocre on a relativity exam....
Analyzing the atomic lines of spectra of red supergiant stars, and comparing the equivalent width to effective temperature. 
This is called imposter syndrome and it's very common at university. Just remember that they let you in because they thought you were smart enough and try not to compare yourself to others.
You mainly just have to focus on yourself and ignore the accomplishments of others around you even if it is rude. Focus is key. 
Hahaha, welcome to physics! Where literally everyone is smarter and more successful than you!

Seriously, read up on imposter syndrome, it will make a lot of stuff you've been feeling make more sense. And I guarantee that if you brought this up to your peers and they were being honest, they'd say they were feeling the same way.

My suggestion is to pick up a hobby that sounds impressively difficult but is actually pretty easy, something outside of the normal nerd culture that I assume permeates your department.
I think most people feel like this at some point, I know I have/do. Partly this is just a "success bias", i.e. people will only talk about/post about the things they succeed at, not the ones they fail/struggle at. Also, I think it has to do with the fact that as you move on in life (school->undergrad->postgrad/work) you tend to surround yourself with more skilled/driven people, who can come across as more successful than the people you used to compare yourself with. Unless you are really struggling with the work don't worry about it. Finish your degree, then compare where you are compared to where you were when you started. If you have found something you love then consider yourself lucky, I know many people who are still searching.
There will ALWAYS be people ahead of you and people behind you. That will be universal for the rest of your life. Whats important is that you do the best you can at whatever makes you happy. I know that sounds completely cliche but its true. Nothing matters except your own happiness and well being. Figure out what lights your fire and pour as much fuel as you can into it.
Hi, I've been dealing with this a lot myself recently. I'm 25 and just entered my junior year of an engineering program, and I didn't find my love for math and physics until I was 23. I just transfered from a community school to a well regarded school and yeah, it's intimidating. What I've been finding helps me at least is to try to forget about the other students. I'm not here for them. I'm here because I find this stuff exciting worthwhile on its own. Try your best to focus on why you want to do the work and then just do your best.
I understand this feeling all too well. I often times think the same thing, although my circumstances are a bit different. I was kicked out of school (for non-academic reasons) and haven't had the funds to go back. I think it's important to remember that no-one understands your abilities and limitations more than yourself, and that just about everyone else it thinking the same thing. Try not to get hung up on the quest for success and just enjoy learning while you can :)
I'm in a similar boat. There are many ways to improve academic performance (I'm talking of real science) like regular [aerobic exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise), [mindfulness meditation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/2i875y/meditation_will_improve_your_life/?ref=share&ref_source=link) and generally working your ass off day and night until your brain adapats to a heavier work-load. Trust me, your learning and memory will increase over time if you train hard.

Besides, some substances like [Bacopa Monnieri](https://examine.com/supplements/bacopa+monnieri/) have been repeatedly found to improve learning and memory in humans after 12 weeks of supplementation. Head over to /r/Nootropics for more information but I don't recommend you start taking any of the popular yet barely researched substances.
Finding something you love is half the battle.  It doesn't matter if others seem to be ahead of you, as long as you never give up you'll eventually be the best.
Look the big secret to life is this:

If you find something you are passionate in you will be incredibly successful and learn far faster than people just doing things for the sake of it. GUARANTEED

People often mistake intelligence for work, I'd say over 80% of people can become a Doctor, but less than 1% invest the energy and time to do it as they don't have the passion.

I look at it as everyone has 100 points of energy per day, some people spend 60 of them at a job they hate, 10 of them doing chores, 10 of them with family and then 20 watching TV/downtime. If you have found something which you can dedicate 80-85 points to due to it being your passion then success is undeniable I promise you.
I'm in the same situation! I'm 20 also and I'm about to start studying physics without much prior knowledge in the subject. But the concepts that I have learned have drawn me to it and I feel like it's exactly what I should be studying. My worry is that once I actually get into the harder classes, I'll realize I'm not good at it and I'll be wasting my time. 
Just do what you like and stick to it.
I dunno how just got out some "crazy black hole" depression (more than 5 years) and got into physics, I'm 27 and sometimes just can't help it but feel like shit, even though I'm not doing bad or anything.
Always take the path of least action.
While they can sound impressive, the main difference between the two is that PhD's are more geared towards research, while Masters degrees are more applied. So if you don't plan on going into research science I would suggest doing a bachelor's in applied physics (if your school offers that kind of concentration), as that will give you a bit more of a connect from the pure physics to the engineering. Then from there a masters in whatever egineering you want to do would be the best bet.
What I think they mean by that is a photon of **visible** light, which has a certain **wavelength** range.  After all, photons are the quanta of all electromagnetic radiation (e.g., infrared, ultraviolet, etc), not just wavelengths visible to the eye, as explained [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon).  Illustrative graphic [here](http://www.redorbit.com/media/uploads/2004/10/6_c9b95f985acbe749f13bf6301a3180a85.jpg)
I would say, in addition to what /u/JRMDB said (they typically mean *visible* light specifically), it can be worth specifying that the unit of light you're talking about is a photon.
I guess any hypothetical carrier of a U(1) gauge field could dubbed a "photon" of sorts. e.g. [dark photon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_photon).

However, I'd say it's unlikely that's what anyone using the phrase "photon of light" would have in mind.
Photons have qualitatively different behaviour depending upon their wavelength.

Photons of visible light are easily reflected by mirrors and refracted by glass, photons of much shorter or much longer wavelength are not.

In some contexts, it's being used to refer to the smallest divisible amount of EM radiation, a single qunta, the same way a grain is the smallest unit of sand. You might say something like, "This chip can detect a single photon of light."
even if there are not other types of photons there are certainly other quantities of light
It's kind of the same thing as saying "a gaggle of geese" instead of saying "a gaggle". It ensures a minimum of ambiguity (though photons are well known to be the name for a quanta of light), and is usually said out of habit.
I suppose it's meant to clarify that it's a photon, not a wavelength that we are discussing. They could certainly drop the "light", but they couldn't drop the "photon".
I prefer "an electromagnetic photon of light".
There are perhaps other massless particles that travel at c, but they are not called photons.  For example many physicists think the gravitational force is carried by a massless particle that travels at c called a graviton.
You might have a photon of IR, UV, Gamma ....   
A photon of light is in the visible spectrum. 
The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths (400-700 nm) is called visible light or simply light.
meh. please rsvp.
You are blowing the hot air around the fire away and partially extinguishing the flame while also introducing a great deal of oxygen rich air. This make a much larger temperature gradient than existed before while also increasing the combustion rate locally which produces even more heat. This temperature gradient rapidly heats the air around whatever is burning and partially reignites the flame, lowering the density of the air which expands outward rapidly. There are now two competing forces: your breath, and the fires volumetric heating expansion. This creates a harmonic oscillation which you hear as sound. So basically a combination of your two conjectures. 

I think your issue is that you can't imagine a gas acting as a speaker diaphragm as we are claiming a fire does. But this happens all the time. Consider the noise in a fast moving car with its windows open. This noise is caused by the rapid movement of air in and out of the windows. There's no solid body moving the air, it's just being pushed that way by the turbulent oscillation of the air moving around the car. Similarly when you fire a gun loaded with blanks, there's no solid bullet to make the noise, just the rapidly expanding gas caused by the explosion of the gunpowder. Or when a lightning bolt rapidly heats and expands the air around it producing thunder. 
Great question. I don't know for sure, but maybe it has something to do with the moving air particles being lower density and the hot air from the fire rushes in quickly. The rushing in of the hot air isn't constant due to turbulence, and so sometimes it moves fast, and then not so fast, and then fast again in a somewhat 'random' fashion. The variable speed of the air makes varying waves in the air, and so you get the fluttering sound. 

That probably isn't correct though.
I'd have to assume it's because you're making the reaction less efficient by cooling it. Yes you are adding more oxygen, but you're also increasing heat transfer.
I don't know either, but I have another guess: the cold and hot air mix to create vortexes, and as the turbulent vortex dissipates into the surrounding air, that energy turns into audible white noise, just like all other turbulent fluid flow.

So my guess would be that when you blow on a flame, but not hard enough to put it out, you are basically creating a bunch of tiny tornadoes in the flame, and that white noise sound you hear is the energy from the turbulence dissipating into the surrounding air.

Someone more expert than me could probably better explain how turbulent fluid flow produces sound.
Yes in my experience there seems to be some mistakes in Y&F's university physics. Mostly from answers not being updated from previous editions which used different values for various quantities.

Between that and Mastering Physics I'm developing a keen hatred for anything even remotely related to Pearson.
I have no experience with Young's books, but if you want to look into alternatives a very popular text book for physics is [Physics for Scientists & Engineers](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/program/Giancoli-Physics-for-Scientists-and-Engineers-with-Modern-Physics-and-Mastering-Physics-4th-Edition/PGM322963.html) by Giancoli, perfect for introductionary courses into classical mechanics. For a more advanced text book about classical mechanics you might want to look into [Classical Mechanics](https://www.amazon.com/Classical-Mechanics-John-R-Taylor/dp/189138922X) by John R. Taylor.
There is a site out there with all of the answers to Y&F University Physics worked out - perhaps if you can find this, you'd be able to see if your methods are correct and they are plugging in different numbers due to previous editions / if the answer key is giving you the answer to a different problem or something. i think if you just google "University Physics Solution Manual" there's a github that pops up with PDFs of all the chapters
Well, first electron orbitals are only exact for non-relativistic hydrogen. So for any kind of multi-electron atom the electron energy levels and their spatial distribution is different. Chemists usually use some kind of orbital hybridization model to study this. I've seen this mostly in the context of molecular orbitals, but it should be true within multi-electron atoms as well. 

When orbitals hybridize, they do exactly what you suggest that they should do. Imagine Helium in a particular excited state, for example. The electron configuration of an excited Helium state, if it were noninteracting, could be 1s^1 1p^1. These 2 non-interacting orbitals overlap significantly, so introducing the electron interactions would raise the average energy of this uncorrelated state significantly. What happens is that instead the orbitals hybridize. You get, approximately, 2 new orbitals made out of the 2 non-interacting ones. And the places where these new hybrid orbitals differ from the non-interacting ones the most are precisely where the non-interacting orbitals overlap. Roughly speaking, areas of overlap 'repel' each other to create new orbitals where the electrons are, on average, farther away from each other than they would have been in the non-interacting orbitals. 

The other thing you have to remember is that for multi-electron atoms, plots of the spatial density can be misleading. The electron positions are NOT uncorrelated. I'm not 100% sure, but I bet that they are correlated in precisely the way you suggest: when one electron is in a certain place, it is very unlikely to find the second electron nearby. It's probably most likely to find it on the opposite side of the nucleus, or something approximately like that. 

The problem with configurations where the 2 electrons are EXACTLY locked on opposite sides of the nucleus from each other, or exactly equidistant from each other is that those states have the lowest average potential energy, but they have very high average kinetic energy. If you imagine that an electron is localized to a small area very far from the other one, then you can think about it as being approximately a Gaussian wavepacket, with some small variance V. The Fourier Transform of this wavepacket will be a Gaussian in momentum-space but with a variance ~1/V. The smaller you make V to lock the electrons equidistant from each other, the wider you make the distribution in momentum-space, increasing the average kinetic energy.
My guess would be that electron-electron interactions are dominant only at small distances; once you get to large distances (i.e. Radii of atoms) these interactions are negligible.

I do know that these interactions are complex, but I'm afraid this is the best answer I can give (hopefully someone who knows more will give more insight).
The video is linked. Hope it works. I turned it off once. If I leave it off for a while, the movement stops and begins gradually once I turn it on again. 

My question is whether it is actually moving physically or it is just because the electricity fluctuating enough to cause a fluctuation in the emitted light?

If there is a magnetic field around the bulb then the alternating current going through the filament will cause motion like that.
[Thats how this bulb does it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mci04eznR-Y)
All of them, eventually.
I wrote this last time I saw this question asked (on /r/theydidthemath I believe): 

If anybody dies at all, it's E. That rock is missing a huge chunk and is dangerously imbalanced. A cylinder (because who would cut a slot like that in a sphere?) 2 m in diameter and 1 m wide made of granite (2750 kg/m3) would weigh approximately 8.6 tons. The slot looks about 0.75 m in diameter, so that removes 1.2 tons, for a total of 7.4 tons of granite.

Let's say the centerpoint of the slot is 0.7 m from the center of the rock. The slot is about -1/7 the mass of the whole rock, so our big slotted rock's center of gravity shifts 0.1 m below it's circular center. At a full 90 degrees of rotation, this imbalance generates a torque of nearly 7300 Nm. Even pushing at the very top of the rock for a maximum 2 m lever action, which it doesn't look like E can even reach, it would still require over 3600 N to overcome the moment of rolling back.

According to the [Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety](http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/push1.html), a worker should never exceed 225 N of horizontal pushing force, or 675 N if he can brace himself against a solid object. We can assume these numbers are considerably less than maximum possible values for safety purposes, but that still requires Mr. E to exert 5-15x the recommended maximum pushing force under ideal pushing circumstances, and he is both lacking something to brace against and too short to reach optimal leverage on the rock.

At 0.5 m from the edge, the rock will have rotated half a radian or 28.6 degrees once directly over the cusp. This brings the CoM 0.048 m out of line, and introduces 3400 Nm of total back-torque. To shift the CoM 0.05 m further laterally, the approximate tipping point of the rock, it must rotate an additional 2.75 degrees, but this adds a negligible amount of torque. If we take the drawing at face value, E is pushing laterally halfway up the rock, so he gets 1 m of leverage, and must exert 3400 N of force to move it.

3400 N of lateral push is a significant amount of force. That's almost 350 kg or 800 lbs, and closer to 15x CCOHS's maximum recommended push without bracing. It is unlikely E can muster the strength to even get the rock over the edge, at which point he will falter under the immense strain placed on his body, slip and fall to the ground behind the rock, and be slowly crushed to death.

It may be possible for him to build enough inertia in the early stages of pushing to just barely get the rock over the edge, or do some lame back and forth resonance maneuver, but in that case nobody dies at all and E sulks away in shame.
If the ramp below E is teflon, then D will die
Dear People Who Know How To Animation,

Will you please please animate any or all of the possibilities discussed by the excellent physcsicists in this thread?

Thank you,

I don't think it's answerable in any meaningful way. 

We can presume the two round objects are made of the same material because of the fact that they look alike. (But we can't be sure, so the lever at C could come down and squish the figure if the density of the rolling stone is sufficiently higher.) 

Also, it looks like the rolling stone would smash the fella at D in the head, but he has plenty of space to just duck. 

Assuming similar enough object densities, the answer is, "No one dies, they just did this to have a good story to tell down at the pub."
Nobody apparently: https://gyazo.com/d306751ba04969a3fca9e29e96d63426

But probably D: https://gyazo.com/6d916a9876647ab9926f70541c2516ec

**EDIT**: This is my favorite:
https://gyazo.com/865cdfc5602208d3d54e88da3f792d51
D, nobody else. 

The crescent block isnt heavy enough to outweigh the complete block so a, b and c are safe, im assuming D cannot duck and while im not completely certain if i calculated it correctly, chances are good his head will get hit by the crescent block. 
D only.

Rolling distance is about 2 *pi* r (slope=5r), so full rotation and squish.

Hole in disk means it is lighter than the whole disk, so no imbalance. The only tricky bit is the bump on see-saw above C - will it cause downward force as disk rolls over it at speed? I don't think so, as it is only r distance from the centre fulcrum, while whole ball is 3, and the bump is almost horizontal, so downward force will be minimal.
I think it somewhat depends what happens when the ball with the gap actually gets to the point where the gap is at the bottom.  It certainly wouldn't just roll the exact same way as a complete ball would.  It might be close enough, but it might also bump or slide in  an unpredictable way.

But if it does roll like a regular ball, then D takes a shot to the face.  It rolls roughly a complete circumference, depending on where you start counting from, but when it hits D the gap is at the top.

After that, it depends on how much right-to-left momentum it has.  As others have noted, it probably doesn't kill C, but I wonder if it has enough speed to kind of flick/jump/bump over the solid ball - after hitting the little chock on the seesaw - and kill A or B itself.
The scale won't tip unless the balls are very inelastic and the walls are indestructible. This is due to the small ledge present after D and before C, which negates downward inertia. A B and C are safe. E is safe; he can push with very little force and still move the stone.

The circumference of the rolling stone is pi; it starts in an upright position and rolls about 6 (1+the triangle hypotenuse of 5) radii, therefore is about upright when it crushes D, assuming the stone doesn't slip.
E, because the boulder is rolling to the right at a speed much too fast for him to stop it.
None
Speaking as if this were **actual physics**... D and C are the only ones with a chance of death as long as E is the only one to move. If the hole lines up as it looks like it does D should live and if that Fulcrum/leaver are strong enough to hold the weight of the rock without snapping, C will live as well. Since the rock with the gaping hole is less dense then the other rock and it never drops to give it downward momentum, it should just roll right up against the other stone never effecting the two on the other side of the wall. 

BUTTTTtttt.. this *is* **gamephysics**, E will push the rock, his hands will stay on it and stretch with it as it flies all over the screen murdering everyone. 
Am I the only disappointed there isn't a gif of the results?
E can't move that heavy of a rock. He pushes it, slips off  the cliff to the right and dies.
B is dead.

E alive at all times.

D can duck, alive at all times.

A C alive only if the following is true:

Since the top rock has a portion cut out, it would be lighter than the bottom rock (since they have similar size), the seesaw will not go down; so C is alive.

Since the top rock (let's say the rock keeps it's shape and not break) still travels down with some momentum, and the seesaw acts as an extended ramp (little bump on there to help it fly over the bottom rock). A is alive, B is dead.
Doesn't D? The stone will make almost 1 rotation by my calculation, when it needs to make a little under half a rotation to spare D. It will travel 5 units (just a bit more) to hit D, and it appears to have radius 1. C=2π, so it will make 5/2π revolutions, which is ~5/6.28 which is ~4/5.

I don't know my level physics well enough to know if momentum from falling from a greater height than the resting stone at the bottom is going to kill C or be enough to life the stone over B. I very much doubt it'll ever hit A though.
I'm going to go with B,C,and D. I don't even get how E is supposed to be in danger.
This would be a much more satisfying post if it were a gif. 
What weights (and material? would be required for the round objects in order for A to die?
All of them, i hope
Wait... is A kind of, you know, excited by all this? And possibly a bit freakish in the junkular region of his anatomy?
Has anyone assumed it is made of rubber?
No one.
Depends on the the speed of the push, the friction properties between the boulder and the surface, and the relative mass of the moving boulder to the stationary boulder. 
You can see why the Boltons eventually rejected this, and went for the flayed man as their Sigil instead.
Everyone lives.  Hollowed out rock doesn't impact D because at that point in its rotation the hollow part will roll over D's head.  The hollowed out rock weighs less than the solid one so the action stops with the hollowed out rock sitting on the teeter totter.  
Everyone gets out of the way, E goes to prison for attempted manslaughter, C gets hospitalized for attempted suicide.
Pushing giant rocks like these is not easy wuth human force.  balancing giant rocks exist on earth

Plot twist. Friction is negligible.

None will die because these drawings have no potential energy.
If one of them is Kraft Punk, he won't die.
What's the real answer!?!?
If Reddit taught me anything, it's that they all die since nobody has shoes.
D dies, momentum of lopsided rock ends up passing quickly and hitting the ramp and blocking the next big rock.
Either B or A.   

Everyone. After Sisyphus (E) finally pushes his last rock he falls off the back breaking his neck.

D Smartly ducks thinking himself safe but the weight of the rock tumbling down traps him until death. 

It also snaps the wood C is underneath killing him.

In a completely unrelated note A is suicidal but cant look at his own death so goes for a back flip. Both A and B have weak necks they both die when they connect.
Only E dies. D can simply duck away and the rock will crash into the other rock causing and they both will come to rest on the left side of the lever. 

However A,B,C and D will be very angry at E for trying to kill them and seek revenge.
B, C and D
A dies. Hit by launched projectile. 
B.

I think the best ones achievable without serious engineering would be:

* the geiger counter and radioactive source approach from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator, probably using an Arduino kit.
* unpredictable signal noise using a reverse-biased transistor: http://makezine.com/projects/really-really-random-number-generator/

the second one is probably easiest to adapt to the ODroid.

Or you can try "People-as-a-Service." If you want 1000 random bits, use the Twitter API to get the last 1000 tweets and count the characters. If odd# zero, if even# 1.
Given that the only source of heat in this situation is the hand itself your question should be "how can I minimize the amount of heat lost from my hands?"

Considering this and that we are only changing the shape of our heat source we want to minimize the surface area of one's hands that are exposed to the heat sink. Given that a sphere is the object with the highest volume to surface area ratio one would want to make one's hands are close to a perfect sphere as possible

So unless someone can contortion their hands oddly id imagine making a fist and covering it with the other hand would be the most efficient


Now this is a first order estimate and does NOT take into account heat differentials between individual fingers/the bulk of the hand. But I dont know enough about that to tell you more
Think of your hand like a fin or a heat sink you'd see on a circuit board. The main difference being that the goal is to retain, rather than dispel, as much heat as possible.

There are 3 modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection and radiation. All of these are dependent on the surface area normal to the direction of heat flow (like any other type of flux). In general, higher A means higher Q (where Q is the rate of heat transfer). Since heat always moves from a hot to a cold place due to the 2nd law of thermodynamics, Q is the rate of transfer of heat from your hands to the environment. This means that the smallest Q would correspond to the smallest possible outer surface area. So making a fist with one hand and covering it with the other.

Note that this is a vast oversimplification. In reality your fist is not the same as a homogenous sphere of material. However, this is the probably the best and most practical explanation that can be given without some sort of simulation or experimentation.
You should ask at the Physi s dept. of your local community college.

My guess would be the masters in Physics is better.
I teach at a community college.  Requirements can certainly vary, but I can at least give you an idea.  We require all of our faculty to have a masters degree, and at least 18 credits of graduate-level courses in the discipline that you are teaching.
*Sets, Functions, and Logic: An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics, Third Edition*, by Keith Devlin.

Either of the two Munich ones (Ludwig Maximilian or the Technical University) or Heidelberg. You can also try the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ) or Lausanne (EPFL). ETHZ is joint German/English and EPFL is joint French/English.

[Young & Freedman's *University Physics*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/University-Physics-Modern-Hugh-D-Young/1292100311/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1478487336&sr=1-1&keywords=University+Physics) is the standard first year undergraduate textbook, at least in the UK. You can also read [Feynman's Lectures](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) free online which provide a slightly less technical but also more interesting discussion of broader physics.

Careers are wide ranging. You can stay in academia, of course, but there are also plenty of applications of physics in industry. Then there are the usual consultancy (PwC, KPMG, etc) and hedge fund (usually as a quant analyst) options. Really anything that asks for strong mathematical skills.

Most PhD courses require an MSc as a prerequisite as far as I know.
University doesn't really matter all that much, I've never met anyone who cared where you did your Bachelor - it matters a little more for the Master, but I'd still say it's not all too important. If you want to go to the best, choose TU Munich. In general the universities in the Exzellenzinitiative should all provide a nice environment (including those that were in the initiative and later fell out again, like the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology).


Books for Beginner's I'd say Demtröder Experimentalphysik 1-4 are the best books for the BSc experimental physics courses. (at least 1 and 2 are, for 3 and 4 there are alternatives that I like better, but those are some time off for you anyway)

Don't stop with the bachelor's degree! From reading this subreddit I get the impression, that this is very different in the US, but here the Bachelor degree is basically worth nothing. You need an MSc for good chances of employment. If you have one the outlook is pretty positive though, the DPG (Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft) releases studies on the labor market for physicists in regular intervals and right now it's basically full employment for physicists with a Master or higher.

There are grad schools build after the american model where you can basically start with your PhD right after you Bachelor, it's not the norm though, most of the time you'll have to finish you Master before starting your PhD.

Salary is shitty if you're talking about your salary as a PhD-student. You'll be making more than enough for a living (1200€-1800€ after taxes from my experience) but you're bound to make much more in industry.

If you're interested in this, I suggest to look into the report from the DPG, you'll find salaries, employment numbers etc.:
https://www.dpg-physik.de/veroeffentlichung/broschueren/studien/arbeitsmarktstudie_2016.pdf

Keep in mind that this is about the current situation though. Nobody can tell you how it will look like when you finish.


Now advice:
1) university is not school, so nobody will care if you fall behind and nobody will tell you to do your homework - in fact if you don't do it your tutor will most likely be happy because he doesn't have to correct your stuff and can instead work on his thesis. You'll need to adjust to that and find you own motivation.

2) find a study group as soon as possible. It makes studying much more fun and much less work. You can also help each other out which is a major advantage

3) don't buy books, it's a waste of money. They are expensive and if you want to stay legal and don't want to just download them illegaly your university will have a big selection of books in their library. Once you've finished your Bachelor you can think about buying a few books that you need for your specific field of interest.

4) Physics is hard. It's doable and everyone that I know who has put the time in, managed to get his degree, but you'll need to be willing to sacrifice a lot of free time to study if you want to finish your degree. You don't have to be a genius but you have to be willing to work hard. Most our summers were spent studying inside the physics department looking at the humanities students enjoying the sun in the park outside. ;)
You can find all your answers [here](http://bfy.tw/8bkv). 
Already been said, but go with the Linux/Windows dual boot. Over time you'll probably find yourself using Linux more than Windows.
Honestly getting programs and a dev environment working on OS X is a lot simpler then on Windows as xcode will give you access to the compiler and a very nice terminal with bash support, what was your problem with it? Also, a LOT of software for THEP is made to run on linux and thus getting it working on OS X is very simple and normally doesnt require any changes.

If you are dead set on not getting a OS X laptop, which isnt a bad thing, I would do what /u/ginnungagap suggested and dual boot with linux. I've never had access to a large computing environment that ran windows so I think that using a pure windows system would be a draw back, if nothing more then just for the lack of a good terminal. Though you could install cygwin on one and get most of the linux enviroment you would need.

Overall, if you have a working pro I dont think you need to spend money on a new one. Learn how to use what you have and it should last you a long time.
If you're a gamer, then I'd maybe look into setting up a dual boot with windows and linux. That would give you the best of both worlds, and from a coding standpoint macs are very similar to linux. Ubuntu is a good place to start. There are plenty of guides for getting set up with dual boot and it's not hard to do. And besides, learning linux now will help you later on in theory.
I'm also in the same boat in you, just a tier higher. I've used fedora and Centos for about a year and a half now and decided to delve into arch linux. First year in undergrad physics, and managed to set up my arch install today.
Linux is simpler to use as a developing environment and you don't have to worry about any legal issues when distributing code packaged with the gnu scientific library, and other tools like root.
I still am forced to use windows when at school (times new roman 12 point font, and propitiatory apps like snap.) and I've never touched a mac in my life, I've heard it is similar to BSD so it has similar commands to linux.
you'll get much better specifications if you get a non-apple laptop. pay for high end hardware, not brand. usually when asked about "machine to do computing" i'll say better get a top desktop, but if your focus is portability than go with a laptop.

also use linux. windows is pretty cumbersome to do anything academic or programming related.
Multiple options are available depending on your needs and how much setup and tinkering you're comfortable with, including:

1. Dual boot a linux distro and Windows 10 (as has already been mentioned)

2. Install a linux distro in a virtual machine using the free Virtualbox or VMware Player (probably only practical if your laptap has at least 8 gb RAM). 

3. Use the available built-in bash shell (command line only) option in Windows 10, see  [the Windows Subsystem for Linux FAQ](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/faq). Also see [this](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/07/22/fun-with-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/)

4. Use a cloud-based development environment such as Codio, Codeanywhere, Codenvy, Cloud9, etc.  Some of these can be integrated with Github or Bitbucket online source code repositories.

5. Use [math/programming tools often used in computational physics](http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/classes/python-science/)

6. Dual boot Neverware's CloudReady Chrome OS (https://www.neverware.com). Some people use this for development, though I consider it a very limited environment compared to a full linux distro install.  You can also install CloudReady in a VM though the screen resolution will be limited to 1024x768.

7. If you need a local web server on your Windows machine, WAMP and XAMPP are available. Similar software stacks are available for linux, such as LAMP.  Microsoft's Visual Studio Community suite is freely available for Windows, Linux,  Mac, and I believe Android as well.

There may also be other options, but these are ones I know about.
Honestly I'd go with a $250 chromebook + GalliumOS and if you need extra space an external harddrive.

That is unless you have a ridiculous amount of disposable income.
A bit late to this thread, but here's what I'd recommend (I'm a PhD student that does highly parallel simulations):

* As lots of other people are saying, Linux is the way to go. Unless you want to game on the laptop, I wouldn't even bother with dual booting Windows.

* If you want to use a Mac, get familiar with things like homebrew, which basically adds Linux-style package management.

* You don't need super high-end hardware; if you need to do extensive parallel numerical work, you'll almost always have a server, cluster, etc. you SSH into and run jobs on.

* Some makes / models I would consider: Dell XPS 13 (great battery life and very portable but screen is honestly a bit small for programming IMO), Dell Latitude 3000/5000 series (I got a highly-spec'ed Latitude 3470 at a really good price and like it quite a bit), Thinkpad X1 carbon (super portable and light but pricey), Thinkpad T series (Lenovo's workhorse business class machines)
Maybe there are some things you want to have a look for while buying a laptop (that is supposed to last like 3 to 5 years):

OS: I like Ubuntu (maybe getting another Desktop-Enviroment then Unity) also it will get you a bit into Bash and using a Shell. Also it is like the to go OS for most Computers in our University (of Cologne). Moreover Ubuntu feels like you can't destroy it by regular use. Saying that Windows might work as well if you are a bit cautious about what you install.

Ram - if you are able to extend it by yourself, go for it (2*8gb is a big deal in felt speed).
CPU: try getting a laptop with a CPU of the latest series (meaning the architecture)
Graphic Card - sounds not like a big deal for what you want but still it is nice to have if you ever wanna play with that thing.

Haptical feeling: If your machine has the Power it needs, it comes mainly down to how it feels. Only solution i have for you is go into a store touch machines and type on them.

Only speaking for me, i like the idea of having a Convertable (Lenovo Thinkpad X; yoga), 
since those get me away from classical pen and paper while listening a lecture. Having stuff you did write synced with a cloud makes handling the Chaos of Notes less big of a deal.

GNU/Linux is the best choice in my humble opinion.
After all the comments on here, im sticking with my Macbook pro and im going to try out Linux (on a memory stick first). Then ill put it on a partition on my PC then maybe one day replace OS X with it
I think it's fair to say that most cosmologists, based on theory and strong observational evidence, accept a standard cosmological model where the **density** of dark energy (amount of energy per unit volume of space) **is constant**.  Dark energy could be considered to be the energy of empty space, or vacuum energy, and basically acts as the cosmological constant in Einstein's field equations of General Relativity. 

Dark energy is smoothly distributed throughout space and **persistent**, so as space expands dark energy density does not dilute away as both matter and radiation density does. [A helpful reference explaining more about this](http://www.askamathematician.com/2016/08/q-what-is-dark-energy/)

There **are** other models that posit dark energy as dynamical, slowly changing over time, such as [quintessence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintessence_(physics).  But the leading model mentioned above suggests it is constant.

Thankyou for the info :)

Yeah, barring some strange effect, you should be right. The fan deal would only work for the thermostat and the object being out of thermodynamic equilibrium, or evaporative cooling like on our skin.
It might turn on a few seconds faster the first time if there are cool spots in your place but on average it comes on just as much.  Might as well just turn it up a notch.
Put ice near the fan so it is actually blowing cool air.
Generally you're right.  Ask your buddy what he thinks the air temperature from the air emitted by the fan would be.  It just sucks in air from the back of the fan and pushes it forward towards the thermostat.  
Moving air has higher conv heat transf coeff
The real answer is it depends on how the thermostat works. If the thermostat produced any heat then your buddy would be right. In reality 99% of thermostats are some kind of passive resister that don't heat so you would be right. Also most modern thermostats don't actually use a single set point they have a range of acceptable temperatures (and actually have a memory) that prevents them from oscillating between on and off near a transition 
That's difficult to say since air flows inside buildings can be quite complex. In general, a room is not the same temperature everywhere, there will be hot spots near sources of heat (heaters, windows in summer, back end of a fridge) and cold spots near sinks (doors and windows in winter, attics and cellars). In addition to that, there is constant convection caused by warm air rising to the ceiling and escaping there or transfering it's heat to the ceiling. So in short it really depends on where the thermostat is located and what direction the fan is blowing, as well as the details of your room.
Well assuming the Kerr metric holds, its likely that some process would intervene to radiate or reject rotational energy before you could get the angular momentum J larger than GM^2.  (obv. using GR units c=1)   I say that, because at that point, the singularity would become naked which probably isn't allowed in our universe, although that is totally speculation.

...so to solve for that J, figure out what your M is such that the circumference is "a light minute".  I didn't do that for you b/c I'm pretty sure the event horizon of a Kerr black hole isn't necessarily spherical (surely the boundary to the ergosphere isn't?) and I think its a lot easier to define a blackhole by its mass than the circumference.  ...I'm also just not familiar enough with the Kerr metric to be confident in an answer.

Also J is almost certainly going to be easier to work with than RPM's.  ...I'm pretty sure that the RPM upper limit would be a function of the mass (so is the theoretical limit on J), and you'd have to be careful to define according to whom you are measuring the RPM's since a feature of the Kerr metric is that the time and angular coordinate get mixed up and that effect will vary depending on how far away you are.  An infinitely far away observer would probably work to calculate that.  
>A physicist told me that the colliding photons must be traveling exactly in opposite velocities for production of massive particles. However, he did not explain why. Is this claim true? If so, what is the reasoning?

It can't be true because that's not a Lorentz-invariant statement. In order for pair production to occur in a photon system, the bare minimum requirement is that the invariant mass of the system exceeds the rest masses of the particles you wish to create. There can be additional constraints based on angular momentum, and the probability of the reaction might be very low until the center of mass energy is significantly higher than the sum of their rest masses, but anyway, at a bare minimum you need enough invariant mass to produce the particle masses. A system of two photons has nonzero invariant mass as long as they're **not** moving in *exactly* the same direction. If the photons are moving in slightly different directions, the system has some mass. For given photon energies, the invariant mass is maximized when they're moving in exactly opposite directions. So it's not true that they need to be moving in exactly opposite directions, but that's how you get the most bang for your buck.

>It seems reasonable that a single photon traveling alone in space could never produce particles by pair production, since that would violate conservation of momentum.

Correct.
You might be interested in this recent preliminary result from [ATLAS](http://cds.cern.ch/record/2220773/files/ATLAS-CONF-2016-111.pdf), where they see evidence for light-by-light scattering.  The diphoton->eplus + epminus is channel is discussed here as a background.

It's worth noting, that instead of using strong lasers here, they are using the EM fields produced by ultra-relativistic lead ion beams.  The lead ions don't hit each other, but the EM fields interact to produce other stuff.  Additionally, this is something that can't be done with conventional proton beams in the LHC because the cross section of the process scales as Z^4, so using lead ions enhances it by a factor of 4.5e6.  
What is the question he's trying to answer?
Have you guys looked into Wet or dry etch ?

GCIB would definitely work but equipment is costly 
Headphones? 

Unless he's talking about the banging on the keys. Then you just need earthquake pads for the stand/table or whatever you have it sitting on. 
Don't play for a week (and otherwise keep your noise to a minimum) and see if the guy still complains.

The people suggesting headphones are probably right, but I think there's something to be said for people becoming hypersensitive to any noise once something sets them off. Not playing for a week would let you see if the person is actually responding to your noise, or has just been triggered by having heard you ONCE and now attributing any and all noise to you. It's worth knowing if you're just facing an unwinnable battle before you start bending over backward trying to be reasonable about this.
Acoustics is tricky.  Aside from headphones, you can try decoupling the speaker and/or the keyboard from any hard surfaces that could be communicating the sound to the structure of the building.  So, putting shag carpeting remnants under the keyboard stand and speaker.  

If that helps but isn't enough, maybe your neighbor will split the cost of fancy sound-deadening rubber:  https://www.mcmaster.com/#sorbothane
Try padding it, go upstairs, get his number, go back downstairs, call him, test it. You know, basic human interaction. 
why is this in /r/physics?
Step 1: go talk to him.

Step 2: wear headphones when you play; see if that disturbs him.  If it does, the problem is you banging on the keys, and the solution to that may be as simple as moving the keyboard to a different spot, or adding some padding or something.  If it doesn't, the problem is the sound.

Step 3: if it's the sound, just wear headphones when you play at night.  To actually solve the problem, though, if the problem is a vibration, then maybe you're using a speaker with too much bass?  Turn that shit down.

I used to play DDR.  It was probably pretty annoying to the neighbors downstairs.  You know what I did?  I knocked on their door and explained that I was going to be playing DDR, and I'd stick to reasonable times and would be happy to stop if there was a problem.  Just do something like that, maybe?
Either thick padding, rubber feet, or pyramid pointed feet. Also make sure its not vibrating against the wall.
Thank you for being respectful of your neighbor.  You seem to be in a very tiny minority of people.
Headphones - you'll get better sound quality than from a small speaker in any case. I do this with my ex church organ.
I'd say pad the speaker to muffle the base or move your keyboard to a different part of the apartment.
The problem might not be the piano music, it is possible that the building has a resonant frequency that causes his floor to bounce up and down with your swaying, pounding, tapping, and pedal motions.  
Decouple from floor by putting a carpet underneath. If your keyboard has hollow metal legs you can also fill with fine sand, the friction absorbs the acoustic energy.
Your phone likely has a motion sensor that will work with a vibration sensor app. Tell your neighbor you are working on a solution. Take your phone in his space put on the supposedly vibrating surface and have a friend or someone play your keyboard. That's your baseline.
Now have a friend put a towel underneath the speaker to simulate rubber padding, see if it makes a difference to the readings.
Rubber/foam sheets stacked up work well. Definitely collaborate with the neighbor if possible. I've lived below a subwoofer owner before and experienced this issue- it was far worse than expected. Try kitchen drawer liner material for a cheap solution. Cork board works too.
High-pass filter set at 150-200hz (wth no resonance)...
In the olden days, people would rest their speakers on a phone book
Go grab like 3 towels and fold them. Place them under your speaker. It should dampen the vibrations enough without effecting the volume. 
Did anyone say headphones yet?
Yes, very cheap solution. Explain to the landlord, or to the neighbor if he talks to you, that his demands are unreasonable, and his sensitivity to noise is incongruent with his desire to live in an apartment complex. He can purchase and apply sound dampening material to his bedroom, which will help keep noise from all sources to a minimum, be they from his own apartment, his neighbors, animals, insects, and road noises.

computing the landing probability for a non-regular polyhedron is essentially hopeless. There is no way that result is exact in general, some approximations have surely been made (I reckon something can be done with some ergodicity hypotheses). With this, combined with the fact there is no source, the formula is pretty much useless.

Note you will be told the probability of landing on a face is proportional to the area of the face, or the solid angle, or whatever... it's obviously false. Here's a counterexample: take a die in the shape of a truncated pyramid, with the pyramid steep and short enough that the die cannot stand on one of the side faces. Then the probability to land on those is always zero.

EDIT: just as a cute addition: the dual polyhedra to those would make fair dice. The dual of an archimedean solid is a Catal polyhedron, which has irregular but equal faces. Of the 13 Catalan solids, 11 make for fair dice (probability = 1 / number of faces).

EDIT2: sorry, the dual to the snub dodecahedron is one of the two that is not fair, but the dual to the rombicosidodecahedron is fine along with other 10 Catalan solids.
The concept of steradians (spherical radian) will be helpful here as the probability of landing on a side should be proportional to the steradians occupied by that side over 4Pi (of the total sphere)

You will need to define a sphere that is positioned on the centre of mass with a radius to the lowest surface point (side with the lowest energy level).

To calculate the steradians for a side, you need to project the area of the side onto a sphere at the lowest energy level. If two sides project to the same point on the sphere, the lowest energy level wins.

Steradians of one side = A/r^2

Where 
A is the area of the sphere covered
r is the radius of the sphere

Edit:
Getting down votes and realized that I missed an important aspect. The other thing to think about is the minimum energy state. A coin will never land on its side because flat is a lower energy state, so this needed to be considered.
If you haven't had vector calc and special relativity yet, my advice would be to just wait until you have. GR is a deep and difficult subject and won't benefit you in any of your classes to know. I would say just wait a year or two, as your time would be better spent understanding your basics/lower div material than struggling on advanced topics without a proper foundation. Cheers.
I was in your position just a couple of years ago, here's what I did.

Start with a mechanics course if you haven't already, it's crucial that you have a solid understanding of physics before you try to learn the advanced stuff.

Learn calc all the way through vector calc. A great resource for this is [Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDesaqWTN6ESk16YRmzuJ8f6-rnuy0Ry7) (this is calc 3, but he has all of them).

Here's where I learned physics Electricity and Magnetism, I also learned special relativity and basic quantum mechanics at this point (QM is optional, but fun)

I learned linear algebra and diff eqs at this point. I used Khan Academy for this, though I'm not sure it's the best resource out there.

Next, I would recommend trying to take a class on mathematical proofs, when you are reading papers rather than watching videos you will appreciate it. I watched [this series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB7540DEDD482705B) because I'm a comp sci major, but if you aren't a comp sci person, just look for a methods of proofs class.

Now it's time for the fun stuff. 

Tensor Calculus is what General Relativity is founded on, I found [this series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXfTHzgMRULkodlIEqfgTS-H1AY_bNtq) to be helpful

So now it's time to get into GR.

[This series from PBS Space Time](https://youtu.be/YycAzdtUIko?list=PLsPUh22kYmNAmjsHke4pd8S9z6m_hVRur) is a great introduction into accurate GR. Their other stuff is great too.

[This video from DrPhysicsA](https://youtu.be/foRPKAKZWx8?list=PLDB15F7E29A5F0426) steps through the thoughts behind each part of the EFEs and is not the best video, but it helped me.

And that's where I couldn't find any more videos, so I used some text resources.

The book [gravitation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0716703440/) is the most commonly used textbook for GR as far as I know.

I found [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deriving_the_Schwarzschild_solution) on wikipedia to be ENORMOUSLY helpful in understanding how to work a general relativity problem. It took me a few times going through it to follow it all the way, but it is great.

Where you go after this really depends on what you are trying to do with GR, personally I find [Kaluza-Klein theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory) to be very intriguing and that leads down the road to string theory.

Good luck
I'd recommend getting through vector calculus first, as you'd learn in E&M.
Read Einstein's original papers. Much will be difficult. Don't expect to ingest it all. But they are remarkably short. They are remarkably clear. And they will get you hooked for all the rest of the due diligence the rest here are suggesting. Take a nice Sunday afternoon and just read through them even if you're not quite yet equipped. It is worth the experience for the relatively small amount of time it will take.

You're lucky - in most fields the primary papers are not approachable at all. But there is much to be gotten from the thinking taking place in Einstein's writings.
im no expert, but as an undergrad i was having trouble with general relativity at first because i hadnt had the prerequisite maths yet. what was really helpful for me was youtube videos on tensor calculus. this is years ago but i think i used kahn academy. after that it was just working through the two halves of the einstein field equation under different conditions and keeping track of indices. 
I think Hartle's book is the one for you, based on what you've written.
You have to start somewhere, so start slow.  Start at a walk.  And then go to a car or a bus and start driving -- there, you're moving faster, that's good.  Then drive to the airport and get in airplane, now you're going really fast.  Now take that plane to Florida and try to get a spot in a space mission.  That's a bit tricky but it is possible.  Now you are really accelerating - good job!  With a little more work, I'll just leave this part as an exercise to the reader, you can figure out how to travel at about 0.1c or so and you'll be really getting into general relativity.

I'd say good luck and see you when you get back, but I'll be dead.
You can just read A First Course in General Relativity by Schutz. You don't need to know much calculus. Linear algebra is much more important. Special relativity is not so complicated you need to learn it elsewhere first.
Hartle's textbook is very undergraduate friendly. Physics first math later. Though you'll still need to know some.
In addition to the good tips you'll get here, [check out this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/42jbeu/how_should_i_learn_general_relativity/) which are answers to a similar question as yours.  And also, at some point in your learning, I recommend this [general overview as supplemental reading](http://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/2/4/23)
If you should care to familiarize yourself so early on, read about non-euclidean geometry. Problems like embedding the spherical geometry onto the plane. These mathematics began what became general relativity. Otherwise just follow your university's suggested outline until GR opens up for you.
A second-year abstract algebra course helped me a little for GR (more for quantum), but I would recommend abstract algebra for pretty much all physics undergrads
I don't have any verification for what I'm about to say, so trust this as you wish.


But I took an Introduction to Relativity course and tensors were not really the big issue so much. The issue in understanding exactly what we were talking about was understanding differential geometry terms. Things like the conceptual difference between Riemann, Ricci, and Scalar Curvatures; maybe it was just the professor.

My point is, look for a differential geometry book, not a tensor book. The DG book will contain a section on certain rules about tensors, which you'll get the hang of.
[Susskind's video lectures are pretty approachable.](http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/general-relativity/2012/fall) Lots of other great courses on that site too.
I'm a master student in theoretical physics. As I've gone through similar thoughts as you even since I was in high school. My advice would be not try to take GR seriously at your stage. It doesn't hurt if you read and watch some elementary stuff, like in most of open courses. But in my opinion, it's not just the maths that are difficult. It's about whether or not you are comfortable with that level of abstraction in physics. You would definitely struggle a lot without a proper understanding of vector calculus and an advanced course on classical physics, i.e. Lagrangian/ Hamiltonian formalism, and claasical field theory. You'd better off focus on what you are doing now than trying to stretch too much to get what you are not ready for. All the undergraduate physics courses are good preparation for you to be a better physics mind. 
Learn vector calculus, and go through Einstein's paper even though the math may be beyond scope. Above all, though, learn special relativity first-- there are pretty great resources out there: MIT's online notes or Special Relativity by Helliwell (which I used in class). And check out youtube videos. Special relativity is still conceptually very much a challenge but deals with motion at high speeds in the absence of accelerating frames. So, it is a much simplified version of GR, and is not as mathematically challenging. Good luck, OP. 
No. Get out while you still can...
I don't understand. What do you want to do with Mathematica?
u srs
Try /r/askPhysics or /r/explainlikeimfive, this isn't quite the right subreddit for such a general introductory question.
A straight forward problem and solution. Particularly simple ones.
My suggestion is to start by looking at a list of physics programs that have the research area youre interested in (solid state, HEP, nuclear, etc.). Once you've done that, eliminate schools you don't want to go to or can't go to due to geographical reasons (this school is too far from my family, I don't really want to live in Denmark, etc.). After that start looking at the professors you want to work with. Make sure you see several 3+ ish people you want to work with just in case funding is a problem. Once you've done that you should have a concrete list of schools to pick and chose from. You'll want to spread out schools based on difficulty of being accepted. Ive had friends outright not get into grad school because their safety school was Yale. 
For applying, start with making a list.  Start with schools you've heard of by reputation.  Figure out where your research advisors went.  Look up papers in your field, and note the affiliations of the authors.

For every place on your list, look at the faculty.  Make sure there are multiple people there you'd be fine working with. IF YOU CAN'T FIND AT LEAST 2 SUCH PEOPLE, DON'T APPLY. If applicable, check to see if they have access to computational/experimental/observational facilities you might want to use.  
1.  Figure out what you like - plasma, cosmology, beaches?

2.  Go there

3.  Profit

It's not so much the school you want to look for but the prof and research group that most interests you.
Lots of good things here already, but an additional metric (if you're willing/wanting to go abroad from wherever you live)) is what kind of educational system you want to work in.  Some places treat PhD students like employees: they don't take courses; it's fairly 9-5; they get paid a salary and have vacation days on a standard fixed contract.  In other places you're a student: you take courses, your hours are more yours to determine, and you may get paid by some (possibly varying over time) combination of stipends, grants, or scholarships.  If one or the other approach appeals to you in particular, look for that. 
Warning: I'm a math grad student not physics.

Honestly, I don't think research fit is anywhere near as important as people say. As a matter of fact I think it is one of the least important things. You have a bachelor's. You have no idea what you want to research. And if you do, it can easily be changed. Research is research.

The most important things are 1) your experience as a student and 2) your experience after being a student. 

So figure out what will make your experience as a student best for you. Some things to think about: location (UIUC is a great program but is the middle of Illinois really ideal?), how quals work, amount and type of funding, how do classes work, etc. 

Figure out what happens to people afterward. How many people graduate and in how long? What types of jobs do they get? 

And ultimately, apply to a broad range of schools. Apply to MIT or something, also apply to middle of the road schools, and apply to lesser schools and maybe even a masters program. It's up to you. 

Also one more thing with applying to grad schools. You probably meet the bare minimum requirements for getting into a grad school. You probably would succeed at any school, even MIT and Princeton etc. But the bottom line is number of applicants>number of spots. They have to reject someone. There is a great deal of luck involved. Even if you would do well somewhere, they might still reject you because they have to reject someone. It's hard to differentiate students. A 3.9 GPA is not really any different than a 3.8, especially from different schools. So rejection or acceptance if you meet the minimum requirements is just rolling the dice. By being a stronger candidate you can tilt the odds in your favor but still, there is a strong element of chance.
I also suggest looking into the labs that are on campus. A school with more/bigger labs will have more opportunities to do quality research. This actually was the deciding factor in the grad school I chose.
Your first step is definitely talking to your advisor or someone in your department.  Like really talk to them about all you're thinking, and then start doing it regularly.
I've seen a lot of good comments on here but there are a few things that I also considered when making my choice.  First was how the department handled the issue of qualifying exams.  My strong recommendation is to focus on schools that use core GPA or final exams in the core classes in place of traditional qualifying exams.  Additionally, look at the stipend vs. cost of living i.e. $24k per year at a rural school goes farther than $24k in a city.  This also has the added benefit of giving you an idea of the financial health of the  department.  If a department is paying noticeably less relative to similar schools, it's probably a red flag.  In short, there are a lot of good physics grad programs out there and a ton of "diamond in the rough" type places.  As long as the department is large enough (25+ faculty, 50+ grad students), financially stable, and has faculty that are consistently contributing to their field, you'll do fine no matter where you end up.
In normal QM, we think of things being 'fuzzed out' - particles aren't in just one place usually, they are kind of a mix of a lot of places. When we measure where the particle is though, it stops being fuzzed out and decides on one place to be! This strange phenomenon is what we call wavefunction collapse.

In pilot wave theory, the particles are not fuzzed out. They are always in a particular place. In pilot wave theory, there is no collapse, because there is not any fuzziness to begin with.
It's impossible to explain any concept in QM accurately without math. Do you feel comfortable understanding he math?
Any atomic physics books that anyone particularly liked?

Any introductory text for solid-state physics.  I feel like I'll need to know the basic principles of SSP for my grad school focus, but I don't have room left in my schedule to take a class on it while still in undergrad.
I have a terrible problem discerning questions to understand what's physically happening and what formulas to use. If there's any textbook that could help with that I would appreciate the advice. 
Hi all, I'm switching majors to mechanical engineering and it's been 2 years since I've taken calculus based physics, can anyone make a recommendation for a physics textbook that will reacquaint me with the basics of physics? Specifically mechanics and electromagnetism? I was thinking about getting the Feynman Lectures...
Engineering grad here.

I'd like to learn more about Quantum Mechanics. Any books you all recommend?
I'm looking for an undergraduate quantum mechanics textbook that's not as advanced as Shankar nor too elementary like Griffiths. I think I've narrowed my choices to Binney, Zettili and McIntyre. Which one would you recommend and why?
Is there a good online resource for Newton's Law? My girlfriend has a garbage "professor" and she basically has to learn the course material on her own. Currently she is stuck with Newton's Law and is not getting it, any help on a good online resource would be much appreciated. Thanks

Any resources and/or textbooks you'd recommend to get a little ahead and learn more about particle physics? There are a couple professors here I'd love to work with but I feel like I may not get the chance if I don't try to learn things on my own.
Hi,

I was studing baryogenesis this past week and had the same doupt as you. I found the following review to be quite helpful
https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0609145
The way that you ask does not make sense in much the same way as  "Can a litre of water be reversed?" doesn't. You're asking "Can entropy decrease?".

**No**. The universe and everything in it is heading towards a state of maximum entropy. 

**Yes**. *Locally*, in small regions of space, the entropy of an open system can indeed decrease if (and only if) the entropy of the environment around it increases by the exact\* same amount.

Entropy (S) is expressed as Energy divided by Temperature.

Here's an example:

Most of the energy present on Earth comes from the Sun as photons (discrete packets of light energy). For every photon that Earth receives from the Sun, it radiates about 20 away back into space. If you count up all the discrete energies of the 20 outgoing photons, they match the energy of the single incoming photon. So, what goes in, comes back out...however, what comes out is far *less useful* than what came in. The weak photons that leave Earth will, when they are eventually absorbed by an atom or molecule, not be able to provide much energy to the system, which will not be able to do much work. And so it goes on. The amount of energy never changes, but it becomes so dilute that it stops being of any use as it can no longer power any reactions. Maximum entropy achieved.

\* The usage of the term "exact" is under review...
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER
ask UNIVAC
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics#Statistical_mechanics):

>Statistical mechanics gives an explanation for the second law by postulating that a material is composed of atoms and molecules which are in constant motion. A particular set of positions and velocities for each particle in the system is called a microstate of the system and because of the constant motion, the system is constantly changing its microstate. Statistical mechanics postulates that, in equilibrium, each microstate that the system might be in is equally likely to occur, and when this assumption is made, it leads directly to the conclusion that the second law must hold in a statistical sense. That is, the second law will hold on average, with a statistical variation on the order of 1/√N where N is the number of particles in the system. For everyday (macroscopic) situations, the probability that the second law will be violated is practically zero. However, for systems with a small number of particles, thermodynamic parameters, including the entropy, may show significant statistical deviations from that predicted by the second law. Classical thermodynamic theory does not deal with these statistical variations.

Thermodynamics: never, by an axiom.  
Statistical mechanics: yes, but very unlikely.
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER
Yes, locally.  Apply energy, create more order.  Once that energy is removed, system will move to a more entropic state.

Example--spend energy to stack a bunch of quarters.  You've created a more ordered (less entropy) system.  Walk away, and eventually, you'll find, without you adding energy to the system, the stack of quarters collapsed, through a random addition of energy from the environment.

There are more ways for random energy to enter the system, than there are for a very specific form of energy to enter the system to maintain the ordered (lower entropy) state.  

You can never win.  You can never break even, given long enough time scales.  The house always wins.
When energy changes form, the amount available to do work decreases during the transformation.  The "missing energy" is entropy.  It helps to think about engines and perpetual motion if you don'the want to bother with math stuff.
Nope
You should read Arcadia by Tom Stoppard.
No
Reversing entropy would mean going back in time, so a short answer, no. 
However if you mean decreasing then you could. Only in an open system this is possible. In a closed system, the higher the entropy, the more in equilibrium the system is. When this closed system is in equilibrium, then it cannot go back to the state it started at. 
Let's use the example of coffee and milk (I know this is used a lot, but it works on a simple scale), when you stir the milk in the coffee then the milk will spread around the coffee as much as possible, and will reach equilibrium, however as time goes by, the milk will not separate from the coffee and group up in one spot, this is why entropy cannot be reversed.
what do you mean entropy is the measure disorder, what do you mean by reversing that?
Found this fun new way of levitating magnets over copper. The grade N42 cube magnets are levitating when their axle of polarity is lined horizontally - on a 90 degree angle in respect to the alternating poles of the magnet above. This magnetic gear system induces the spinning. The flat rectangular magnet is stronger grade N52 and it is able to levitate even with a vertical axle of polarity.
It's called an antibubble.

But what's so special about the cello? Does that have something to do with cracking/snapping (don't know a better word for it) type of sound that is produced by a bow on a string that it excites the water a so much the droplets break off?

Nice video. I bet y'all's mouths *dropped* quite often.
I'm only a minute into the video, but I'm gonna pause here to make my predictions.

Having just watched [this veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIyTZDHuarQ), I'm going to guess that this phenomena is caused by standing waives on the surface preventing the bead of liquid from being re-absorbed. OK, time to keep watching!

Hey I was right! (and Destin links the veritasium video too). Holly cow that cello air bubble clip is amazing and beautiful!

 Bobs memories only work in the positive entropy direction, so he can have no recollection of this negative entropy U' and can only remember the U.
Why wouldn't the (much bigger) universe around Bob have the same impact on Bob that you think Bob would be having on the universe? Wouldn't Bob immediately die because the time-inverted entropy would cause Bob's lungs to exude oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide?
There really isn't anything. The LHC isn't capable of doing damage on anything but an extremely local scale. Some things could melt, others could explode, there could be some slight radiation leaks, but nothing really big. Nothing that anyone outside of the facility would notice.
The LHC is only a threat to you if you are a weasel.  If you are a weasel, stay away from the power cables.
A cascade resonance!

Edit: I meant resonance cascade actually
Watch this webcam for a minute.

Vacuum decay maybe? It's to do with the higgs field, which as we know is the sole reason the LHC was created (yes, that's sarcasm)
Considering that Mother Nature has been firing off subatomic particles at us with energies *far* exceeding that which could be produced by LHC for billions of years and nothing catastrophic or apocalyptic has happened, it is safe to say that LHC is incapable of creating the events you are looking for. 
Maybe an event could trigger the collapse of the Higgs field from a false vacuum to a real vacuum, changing the very laws of physics and causing the universe to cease to exist within a sphere spreading at the speed of light outward from the point of origin.

 https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=nC6WRrG36kM
None. [This](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://cern.ch/lsag/LSAG-Report.pdf&ved=0ahUKEwjpn6GcxJDQAhWLrFQKHaF-CxgQFgg0MAI&usg=AFQjCNGNNBcfHGMAPt5dsKbMgLM9XdHrvw&sig2=4xpUJ8rupUDMvkrqCvhuRg) explains why. 
The LHC? Nothing, really.

Even if the LHC somehow how the capability to cause massive destruction, there is no way that some top physicist working there would be able to trick everyone into believing them. You would literally need either some sort of hyper-genius who knows things about physics that we cannot possibly yet know, or some sort of agreement between most, if not all, of the physicists there. 
I remember some chatter about whether the LHC could produce tiny black holes by forcing a great deal of energy into a very small volume. There's no good science behind it, as far as I know, but the idea circulated in the popular media for some time. Since this is sci-fi you might be able to get away with a hand-waving explanation of how this happened even though most physicists agree that it cannot happen.

Alternately, just abandon the standard model entirely and have the LHC accidentally produce some exotic particle that nobody can understand or explain. Maybe it converts everything it touches into antimatter or some wild shit like that. As long as you stick to hand-waving instead of trying to actually explain it with physics I'd be willing to suspend disbelief. It's usually the attempt to provide a detailed explanation that irritates me, because it's never correct and it doesn't further the story.

I appreciated a scene in Looper where one character starts talking about time travel and causality paradoxes, and the other character just says something like "we're not talking about that right now. It works, that's the end of it, let's move on." Wave your hands and focus on the story!
This is beautiful and definitely cool physics. Does it have an analog in other physical systems though? I know oil drops have been discussed as visualizations of Pilot-wave theory, but I'm more curious about the coupled oscillations.

Also, which (if any) droplets could you remove without disturbing the system as a whole? I'm curious what other shapes would be possible.

This is getting way out of hand. There is no connection with physics anymore.
There are many experiments like this one going on right now to test  the pilot waves interpretation of quantum mechanics. Most of our current understanding of quantum mechanics comes from experimental interpretation which leads to philosophically confusing results. 
How can a particle have wave properties? Why does a waveform collapse to one state when you measure it? 
These kinds of questions have no classical analogy which makes them difficult to conceptualize, but the pilot waves interpretation seeks to relate the classical fluid dynamics of droplets bouncing on a vibrating bath to quantum mechanics to answer those questions. 
This is really cool to see, and seems so strange at first. Thinking about it though it's like Oh, of course they would...
Would this qualify as a time crystal?
But can't they NOT bounce forever? There has to be some energy loss, this isn't a perpetual motion machine. Was I, perhaps, lied to by the internet hype machine? 
This is so cool! And it also makes me wonder why they are not teaching this in school. 
perpetual motion?
i don't believe this for a second. The droplet would eventually come to a rest on the surface of the oil. This is pretty easy to debunk by anyone who has ever poured oil into anything.
Not at all, though it certainly means that a complete (all propositions have a proof or an anti-proof) mathematical foundation won't be a part of this. If you consider it necessary for a ToE to be able to assert the absolute truth or falsity of any statement we can make, then the answer is yes. That being said, there are plenty of quite cheerful theories which get along quite fine without this property per sé: the calculus of (inductive/coinductive) constructions being easiest to grok among them IMHO.

Depending on your perception of what proof and logical truth is this is more or less upsetting, I'd say. For instance, there's a notion of constructible object being equivalent to provable proposition, so if you consider that there may be objects in the universe which we can't construct but also can't see why not, this isn't all that shocking, it is simply humbling. If you believe in the more classical interpretations which essentially take truth to be a sentence designating some state of affairs, you might be quite confused about the notion of something being "true" without being able to be shown at all. This is sort of a huge deficiency of this view of logic IMHO, but its the one in the mainstream still today.

Listen to Vladmir Voevodsky for much better and more complete talks on this subject, particularly his talk questioning the consistency of first order arithmetic as an interpretation of Gödel's 2nd theorem.
It really depends on what one means by a ToE. Of course this is too hard to define since there will always be opponents to any definition given. Instead let's consider a scenario taken from [Hawking's perspective] (http://www.hawking.org.uk/godel-and-the-end-of-physics.html) on the matter. What if Goldbach's conjecture is a true but unprovable statement?

Goldbach's conjecture says that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. We can make this problem "physical" by asking: can we always split an even pile of wood blocks into two piles, each of which can be made into a rectangle?

Is this a question our ToE should be able to answer? If yes, then one can probably make a good argument that Godel's theorems suggest that a ToE is unattainable. On the other hand, maybe our ToE doesn't necessarily have to answer Goldbach's conjecture. It should just be able to answer it for any specific even number, not all even numbers. That is, given any even number, one can find, in a finite number of steps, if this even number is the sum of two primes. Perhaps that is what is sufficient for a ToE. 
>Does the "true but not provable" restriction imply that we can never describe any situation?

Unless we are strict rationalists, proof is not the only source of knowledge.

Also, unless we are strictly honest, knowledge is not the only source of descriptions. Astrophysics was used to describe fictional exoplanets for decades before any real ones were discovered, and nothing broke.
If we would focus on predictability instead of figuring our the truthfulness of the any statement about physics world, then the situation is really unknown.
Let's define prediction a bit more. Here I would assume, that it means predicting future state of a theoretical universe at time sat t_n, about which we have a perfect knowledge a time t_o, what is obviously impossible. However we are interested if it was possible from calculation point of view, not measurement pov.
Obviously practically it would still be infeasible, because it is hard to model universe, but we don't care about time it would take.
So let's take very small theoretical universe, let's assume its finite, and that accuracy of calculations is not a problem.

We hope everything left is based on certain rules, and we can calculate any state at any time t_i (take from continuous set). Since we have a countable set of rules, we can't decide truthfulness of all true statements, however at this point we have nothing, that would say it is impossible to calculate some future state. However the physic of universe is strange, and there infinities involved in such a predictions and it may still require to decide truth of any kind of arithmetic statement, i.e. in deciding possible quantum state of infinite number of virtual particles, or calculating the outcome of n-th dimension infinite calculation.

Put it like this, by analogy to computers. It is never possible to decide if the program will finish or not with a single algorithm, however it is quite easy to decide a state in nth step of given program. However if you add extra time dimensions the program can run into, or if you add unknown/omnipotent oracles, then it becomes infeasible.

Also the Godel theorem is not as strong as you would think in physical world. There always possibility of a set of rules to decide truthfulness of any statement from any finite or countable set. You can't really ask more questions than that.
Surprisingly, there can not be such a ToE! Just last year, it was proven that a quite simple physical problem is actually undecidable, namely the mass gap conjencture (i.e. is there an energy gap between the discrete energy states of a system and the continuous states), which is quite important for semiconductors.

The paper is found here:
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v528/n7581/full/nature16059.html

In a nutshell, the authors showed that the mass gap conjecture in 2d spin lattice systems amounted to solving the halting problem, which is unsolvable.

I find this quite amazing, as this disproves the existence of a ToE for a given system, as this means that while we might be able to measure the mass gap we can not come up with a theory from which we can derive that the system has a mass gap.
Note that when you are searching for course information, "College Physics" is usually the name of an algebra-based physics course for biology and other "soft science" majors, while "University Physics" is the name of the calculus-based physics course for math, physics, engineering, and chemistry majors.

Your first-year University Physics course will cover mechanics, dynamics, rotational motion, thermodynamics, wave motion, electricity, and magnetism.

Second year, you will most likely get into "Modern Physics" which covers special relativity and the development of quantum mechanics.
I highly recommend David Griffith's [Introduction to Electrodynamics](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Electrodynamics-4th-David-Griffiths/dp/0321856562).  It is a classic undergraduate text in electrodynamics.  His style is a bit wordy, but I feel it complements all of the mathematics well.  It begins with a good overview of vector calculus which is necessary to do college level E&M, so the text is manageable even if you haven't been exposed to calc 3 yet.  
Whatever the lightest neutrino is, it's that. We're still not sure of the actual neutrino masses, only the squared differences between their masses. We do know however that the sum of the three neutrino masses is less than 0.14 eV.
So the Neutrino is the lightest particle we know of... is the axion predicted in this new research lighter than a neutrino? 
There is some confusion in some of the other comments.

Least massive particles, best of:

1. Electron. Pretty light, can be taken to be massless in lots of cases. Has a mass of 500,000 eV.

2. Neutrinos. We don't know what their masses are. The upper limit is ~1 eV (less if you believe data combinations of BAO and Ly-alpha). We do know the mass splittings, sort of. It is definitely possible that one of them is exactly massless (although this is awkward theoretically, we have no experimental evidence on the issue one way or another).

3. Photons, gluons, and gravitons. They have no mass (theoretically). In practice, measuring something to have zero mass is tricky (it can be done, somewhat, by measuring the number of degrees of spin freedom - massless particles have two while massive have 2s+1). The experimental limits on the photon are quite strong and robust. The experimental limits on the gluon are robust and kinda strong. The limits on the graviton are kinda strong and not at all robust.

All of this has nothing to do with what OP asked about, which is *size*. Doesn't really mean what we think it does, but roughly translates into cross section (a concept related to probability of interacting). For example, for a tennis ball flying through the air in the presence of other tennis balls flying through the air, the cross section is pi\*r^2 , the cross sectional area. For particles, however, it is more complicated. Electrons seem to have infinite cross section, for example. Also, keep in mind that cross section in particular way scales with the mass of the particle (photons have substantial cross sections, for example).

The smallest cross section is a bit of a tricky thing to define, but roughly speaking it would be the neutrino. The neutrino isn't charged under hypercharge or color charge, only weak. So its cross section is quite small by all practical measures. They correspond to the lowest cross sections measured.

That said, if DM is made up of WIMPs (a very popular idea for many reasons), its cross section is probably quite a bit smaller than that of neutrinos.
...what do you think "worldline" means?
i think you are using the word world line not according to its meaning. 

a world line is the path of an object in spacetime. nothing to do with other universes. 

yes when black holes collide it can be felt across world lines (gravitational waves could be detected on earth) but world lines don't mean what you think they mean. 

also there's no world line theory. 
Gravitation waves travel at the speed of light. So if the world lines of objects/gravitational wave are within a light cone, then the gravitational disturbance will interact.

World lines are simply an object's motion in spacetime, and have a local zone that dictate where they can interact or they cannot interact because the light speed distance is too great between world lines.

General relativity has been tested and it's predictive ability is spot on. World lines are just a convenient way to think about how spacetime objects interact in terms of GR. As we learn more or even able to detect quantum gravity a lot of how we explain gravitational waves may change.  But for now, there is no reason to think general relativity cannot explain how gravitational waves and world lines interact. The fact that LIGO knew exactly what to look for and actually detect it should give you more evidence that GR is explaining how our universe works extremely well.
Once again we have a new claim that metallic hydrogen has been directly formed and observed in the lab. If this new result end up being true, it would be a pretty big deal since physicists have been hunting for direct evidence of metallic hydrogen for decades. For a brief explanation and history of the field, [here is a decently good and accessible introduction](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pressure-make-metallic-hydrogen). Now we have seen similar claims in the past, but so far these claims have failed to stand up to closer scrutiny. This most recent claim comes from the [Silvera group at Harvard](http://silvera.physics.harvard.edu/hydrogen.htm). They also used a [diamond anvil cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_anvil_cell) to squeeze hydrogen to insane pressures of up to 500GPa. That's a pressure comparable to the pressure found in the depths of the Earth's core. At 500GPa they report seeing a phase transition where the hydrogen turns reflective. They then fit the optical data to the predictions of the Drude model and claim that they have clear evidence that the phase they see is metallic. To quote the abstract:
>We have studied solid hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures.  With increasing pressure we observe changes in the sample, going from transparent, to black, to a reflective metal, the latter studied at a pressure of 495 GPa.  We have measured the reflectance as a function of wavelength in the visible spectrum finding values as high as 0.90 from the metallic hydrogen. We have fit the reflectance using a Drude free electron model to determine the  plasma frequency of 30.1 eV at T= 5.5 K, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 6.7x10^23 particles/cm^(3), consistent with theoretical estimates. **The properties are those of a metal. Solid metallic hydrogen has been produced in the laboratory.**

All this is pretty exciting, but we'll have to see what holes others in the field may try to dig into this new report.
Pretty cool, most of what I read about metallic hydrogen is something like "we blasted some hydrogen with a femtosecond laser and one of the spectral lines might be similar to something predicted by density functional theory for metallic hydrogen if we squint." This seems to be a big step forward.
Check out Loop Quantum Gravity :) a Quite popular approach to Quantum Gravity using GR as a starting point to quantize spacetime into a lattice of nodes Or knots where spacetime sort of loops around on itself. Might be what You're looking for provided I didnt misunderstand your question. 
Apart from the already mentioned loop quantum gravity, there are a bunch of other ideas of how to quantize spacetime, like for example causal sets, causal dynamical triangulation and shape dynamics. The reason you seldom hear about them is because very few people work on these various things, and also (which of course is closely related) because they typically don't have that much in the way of interesting results. 
Just to clarify, LQG is not discretization of spacetime. The separation into tetrahedra in LQG is analogous to the pre-quantization Fourier expansion of fields in QFT. The tetrahedra are just mathematical tools to express the quantization. 
The point is while a great variety of such models have been investigated, LQG in primis, they share a very general feature: they don't work. The main issue is they don't reproduce a smooth spacetime in the classical limit (when you manage to quantize them, ofc).
There is fairly popular loop quantum gravity, where space is quantized an thus posses some "granular structure" - I'm not sure whether this is still problem or not, but some physicists argue(d) that this theory violates lorentz invariance. There are also noncommutative quantum field theories, where coordinates do not commute (which results into uncertainty relation for coordinates ...) - some of them are stand alone (but often used in context of string theory) and I know at least one which arises from (open) string theory as some low-energy limit. These theories have, howewer, some strange properties such as UV/IR mixing, but I think there are some recent proposals on how to deal with this rather unpleasing phenomenon.
OP, as many have mentioned, Loop Quantum Gravity features a 'discrete' space time in a certain sense. I have some familiarity with the theory, though I am much more familiar with approximate versions of it than the full theory. However, if you have questions about LQG I can try to answer them for you and if I say something wrong maybe someone who knows more than me can chime in. 

Edit:
To answer the thrust of your question, yes there are theories with discrete space time, however they are clearly somewhat unpopular. Part of the reason for this unpopularity is that certain symmetries are broken when you go to discrete space time and we have some convincing experimental evidence that these symmetries hold too well to be described by these discrete theories. One reason for LQGs popularity is that it solves this problem in a fairly convinging (depending on who you talk to) way. If you'd like, I can elaborate on these symmetries and how LQG obeys them, though I'd ask you to tell me your level of mathematical and physical sophistication so I can give you an answer that makes sense to you.  
Lattice QCD.
Causal sets, don't know much them but it something that some people are working on.
No. Schrödinger, like Einstein, never accepted quantum mechanics at all and preferred a deterministic view of physics (although with some caveats).

This is ironic because quantum theory was originally his theory: he proposed the wave equation.
Schröndiger derived his equation from formal arguments based on the mathematical characteristics that such an equation would have to obey. That way, he found an equation that could describe the evolution of an unspecified wave function, which he never really gave any physical meaning. The Copenhagen interpretation, on the other hand, deals with the process of measurement and collapse of the wave function, which is totally different from its time evolution and is not described by Schrödinger's equation. So, even if he discovered the way a wave behaves (which is after all a slight variation of classical mechanics), he did not study the much more bizarre process of measurement, the phenomenon which the Copenhagen interpretation tries to explain. To my knowledge, he did not find any available interpretation convincing, hence his proposal of the cat paradox.
>Schröedinger 

His name is either Schrödinger in the German alphabet, or Schroedinger/Schrodinger in the English alphabet. 

"öe" is wrong in both languages.
indeed some think the cat experiment says that schroedinger believed the cat would really be in this state of superposition, when it just shows that there's something wrong with how you get to that conclusion.
~~Is this guy for real? He has no idea how path integrals work if he thinks he can deviate from the born rule using them. Total garbage.~~

Can anybody answer how a pilot wave theory deals with:

* spin and the spin statistics theorem
* [the Kochen–Specker theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochen%E2%80%93Specker_theorem)


This is definitely a nice way to visualize quantum. But it's constantly been overhyped in the media, for years, as revolutionizing our understanding of quantum mechanics. It doesn't do that.
Complete physics noob here... Would this not be something like a hidden-variable system?
But then what is the wave made out of? If say, photons are particles riding their own wave interaction, then what is the medium of the wave in a vacuum?
I'd say it's a pretty good analogy for pilot-wave, but only for situations that don't involve violating Bell inequalities. It can do the easy stuff, but not the deep interesting classically-intractable stuff.
hmmmmm I can't say I particularly like the idea of saying that anything in physics should come down to what we're comfortable with. There's a difference between deciding how best you prefer to think about physical concepts and deciding how the universe works. The first is totally up to you the other is based on evidence. 
So regardless of the merits of pilot wave theory, this is the best demonstration I've ever seen of what particle/wave behavior actually looks like.  Particularly the self-interference, I've never pictured a particle riding around like that, following the wave outward.  Seeing how a particular peak or valley can make the particle veer off makes it easy to appreciate how complex that motion can become over time and how sensitive it must be to the particle's starting position.

It also makes it clear why waveform interference and distortion by physical objects doesn't count as observation, since the new waveform can be perfectly knowable without exposing any information about the actual course the particle will take.

Even if the actual mechanics don't involve a wave shoving a distinct particle around, it's a nice change of pace to be able to clearly see what sort of route a photon could actually follow though the double-slit and what difference the interference pattern makes, instead of the usual having someone insist that doesn't matter and then drawing a cloud on a piece of paper with a giant question mark to illustrate the concept.

The first time I heard physicists explaining that a photon would take every possible route to their destination simultaneously, I was picturing things like photons popping in and out of existence, some taking a short break to do donuts in the parking lot, and some going back in time to kill Hitler, failing, and returning just in time to splatter on a screen.  This demonstration clearly shows what we're actually dealing with: that while complex, its path is perfectly logical and we could even perfectly determine where it came from and where it was going if the Universe would get off its high horse just once and let us properly measure the damn thing.

The fact that photons can do spooky things like retconning themselves and probably don't actually exist as a particle until the moment they interact with an observer is beside the point if people are starting out with no expectation of what they should be expecting a photon to do, which is going to be the case because we skipped that part and jumped straight in to why it's wrong.  If we did that with Newtonian physics and skipped straight to General Relativity, most people would consider gravity to be some magical concept they can't possibly be expected to understand in any practical way, just like they do with quantum mechanics.  Demonstrations like this are fantastic for connecting the dots and dispelling those myths, even if they can only go so far by themselves.
This is fantastic.
We usually wear overalls and use tiny tools to stop them wave functions from collapsing.
It's cute, but hey there's problems with it.  Don't take this visualization too seriously.

First, each particle has its own pilot wave and those pilot waves don't interact with other particles or other pilot waves.  All one pilot wave does is condition where its particle ends up.  

Second, the form of the pilot wave is not just a function of the boundaries, but also a function of the particles momentum (mass and velocity).  It completely changes form when the momentum changes, and this change is instantaneous out to the edge of the Universe.  

Third, the phase velocity of the pilot wave is c squared over v, where v is the speed of the particle (i.e faster than the speed of light, usually much faster).

Fourth, don't even try to imagine the shape of a pilot wave for a system of two particles or more. 

Fifth, it doesn't predict anything measurable that is not found with the Copenhagen interpretation.
Fascinating, I don't tend to study quantum mechanics, however this has really peeked my interest. I like the wave idea, it's worth more study. Thank you.
I'd suggest not getting a tattoo you don't understand. Especially a 'physics' one.

I'm all for tattoo's but try finding something that suits you. This is rushed and you might regret it later.
Is your design meant to mean ΔS --> ∞? Because that's not true. The second law of thermodynamics says (roughly) that ΔS ≥ 0. In the future, after the heat death of the universe, then indeed ΔS = 0 because no entropy-increasing processes will be possible.

So neither S nor ΔS is going to infinity. I'm not sure if that's what your design meant to show, but make sure it doesn't! Nonetheless I think a design involving the symbols ΔS, ∞, and an arrow (the arrow of time) could still be pretty good because those are related concepts, as long as they are arranged in such a way as to not imply an untrue limit.
An arrow like those that people use on bows? I might be mistaken but I think there's a theory using that, saw on that cosmos series ( neil tyson version) that some crazy greek proposed this thought experiment. Imagine an archer shooting one arrow in a given direction, then he recover the arrow and shoot it to the same direction and does it again and again... It's something to explain infinity of space, I think it fits with the image you're thinking

The arrow would be piercing both but with no direct link
Has anyone ever taken a year off after getting their PHD? 

It doesn't matter whether you went back into academia afterwards or not, I'd be interesting in hearing regardless. I'd be interested in details about what you did in that time, whether you're happy about it, and what the financial situation was if you're willing to give those details.
A question to the European (/non-American) part of the community:

I am currently a last year master student, and I am looking at the possibilities of continuing with a PhD, anywhere in Europe, essentially. Now, there is a lot of advise on reddit concerning the American model of doing a undergrad degree and then going to grad school, but as far as I understand this doesn't really work the same way in (parts of?) Europe. I know in my country at least, PhD positions are posted as a "normal" job listing. Now this leads in to the actual question: how do you then find a relevant PhD program, when the process isn't just to apply for a grad school program at a university? And searching across several countries, how do you even start looking?
On a day-to-day basis, generally speaking, how difficult or intellectually taxing is an entry Chem Engineering job, when compared to the difficult challenges a student faces nearing his Ph.D? 
im a 3rd year bachelor student in east germany and soon ill have to choose a specialization. i can choose between:

"structure of condensed matter"

"electronic properties of solids"

"applied solid state physics and photonics"

"particle and nuclear physics"

"soft condensed matter and biological physics" 

"theoretical physics" 

are any of these particularly good/bad in terms of finding a good paying job after a masters degree? or are the differences so minute that i should just choose my favorite.

which is obviously what i would prefer but if the chance to get a good job is much worse for my first pick compared to my second, i might choose my second favorite specialization.
I'm a physics senior and I'm going to start applying for graduate school for 2018. My research background is in optics and I know if I make that my aim in graduate admissions my chances of getting into a desired school are higher, but I still have these other areas of research unexplored and I don't want to ignore that.

I'm not really sure what to do.

I want to explore other areas of research, like condensed matter, HEPP, solid state, and so forth. Both theory and experimental, but i don't have much time, and the more extensive my optics background is the better my chances are for an AMO centered department.

I understand graduate schools should be chosen on the departments research and not the prestige of the school itself. But I don't want to go to graduate school and do research in optics when I could've much more enjoyed condensed matter theoretical research.

How can I go about getting into a grad school I'd enjoy while not being stuck with an area of research that isn't the most captivating to me? 

And who knows maybe there's a sub-field of optics that could really attract me, I just don't know yet and I feel i'm running out of time.

I'm a freshman physics/mathematics double major, though physics is definitely my main interest. My university has an extremely good math department, and I'll have the opportunity to take graduate-level courses if I wish in future years.

I'm really interested in particle physics, probably theory. Which of [these courses](http://imgur.com/a/2l5Y2) would be most advantageous to take at some point in my undergraduate career?

So far, I've gathered that taking some algebra courses (Advanced 1, Advanced 2, and Lie Groups/Algebra) in addition to Differential Geometry would be good. Are there any others?
Is going to school an extra year/maybe one semester worth it for a biomedical bs degree? I'm a chemistry bs major and I'm also taking math/physics minors, but since I don't like the chemistry electives that my school offers, I have the option to take upper division physics courses instead. And doing that I would end up with just 18 units shy of the biomedical degree, which I could do in one semester, but I'm asking is it worth it in terms of getting a job after school. I'm really not looking at any grad or med school after, I'm really tired of this but I know I could do just one more semester if it's worth it. [I tried looking here for jobs around my city within driving distance, since there's no way I could move out for other reasons, but there's zero. ](http://www.indeed.com) I'm thinking it's because it's not a standard degree like, biochem, physics, or those kind, so I'd like any opinions you guys have.
I'm currently a junior chemical engineering major, and I'm looking to physics grad school because I'm very dissatisfied with my classes- they're boring and don't quench my hunger for understanding. 

Is it possible to go from chemE undergrad to physics PhD program?

if it helps: I have a ~3.4 GPA, and I'm already heavily involved in research (will have 3.5 years of undergrad research experience by graduation)

I have my own research project that is going well and will eventually end up in me publishing a first-author, hopefully high impact paper.


This is all mainly for admissions questions. In general, does anyone have any advice for someone in my position looking at grad school?
I recently changed my major to engineering physics with a minor in computer science. What sort of jobs and careers can I get into with this?
 
If you're willing to take advice from a guy that went to college for 13 years then yeah go for it, get your Physics degree like I finally did. Of course, back then school was a lot cheaper. Started off paying about $100/semester and finished up at maybe $3-500 per, this was 25+ years ago.

I actually began my university studies intending to pursue a Physics degree, even though everyone else wanted me to take math. Tbe problem was that I went to a local school and continued to hang with my high-school friends, most of whom were drop-outs and petty criminals. Just showing up for the tests, which worked fine in HS, didn't work in my math and physics classes and I ended up on and off academic probation for my first few years.

Gave up on physics at this point and started taking Psychology classes. Came within two courses of a Psych bachelor's but somewhere along the line had a Psych prof with a Physics degree who convinced me to try that route again. This time I went to class, applied myself, and finally started to have some success in physics and math classes. So 8 years in I got my Physics BS, my last three semesters were progressively my best as an undergrad, Dean's List and all that, and I ended up with a 3.0/4.0 GPA.

The only job I was offered at graduation was building ordinance for the Navy, so I decided to go back to grad school at the same state college I got my BS at. Forced myself to go to every lecture and keep up with the work, and ended up the top student in the department with straight As in 26 units of grad physics coursework. Five years into this, decided to accept of professional position while I finished by thesis.

The thesis never got finished, for various convoluted reasons, but the career has worked out great without it. My buddy who helped me get that first job did finish his Physics thasis and ended up getting a $500 bonus at work for it. As near as I can figure that must be about what it was worth, although I still make a better salary than he does. I'm happily navigating spacecraft around the solar system for NASA now and it beats the hell out of working at a "real" job. If you're doing what you enjoy then its not really "work" is it?
>I enjoy reading about it both in practice and in theory. 

I would try to figure out if you like *doing* it in practice and theory before committing to anything. Are you prevented from taking any physics classes in your current major? 
Your questions are welcome, but on Thursday we have our "Education and Career Questions" thread, where you may get a better response.

I don't think your progress towards an architecture degree will count much towards a physics degree. You could maybe work towards a civil engineering degree and then apply for physics masters programs?
I can take whichever classes I'd like to. I've taken intro physics and wasn't a huge fan, but I read that it was a weed out class and was designed to be difficult in many cases. Beyond that I'm ignorant of the schooling. 
I'm 29 and with unfinished degree in physics. If you do mental (cerebral) things daily, then you can learn physics at almost any age. 
how is your mathematics?

engineering is more globally practical. 
Oh neat, my senior thesis was on lasers. Unfortunately I just woke up so I'm going to have to come back and edit this throughout the day to include a more comprehensive list.

First, I'll say you should search articles for Micromachining - it's where ablation is used to manipulate small bits of matter and can open up a lot more information (particularly research articles) on the topic than just searching for ablation.

Also, while it doesn't have anything directly on ablation, you should know about the [BYU Optics Textbook](http://optics.byu.edu/BYUOpticsBook_2015.pdf) which is good book in general that's available for free download on their website.

I do know a few good research articles, but it'll take me some time to sort through the relevant ones that are also freely available for public reading. Like I said, I'll work more on this comment throughout the day so stay tuned.

An answer that can't be given as of today. We only know how it works but not why.
Any massless particle with spin 2 must be emitted and absorbed equally by all other kinds of particles with a strength dependent on their energy, and this produces a gravitational field that attracts objects together (and for most objects most of their energy is due to their mass via E = mc^(2)). 

The fact that it affects all particles and they all fall at the same rate given the same gravitational field means that we can also consider the gravitational field to be part of the shape of spacetime itself, because you can take some small region of space and subtract out the same gravitational acceleration on all the particles and it looks just like there isn't any gravity at that point. So just like any point on a sphere looks flat if you zoom in enough, every point in space can be seen as having no gravity (technical term is a pseudo-riemannian manifold) but the space and time axes are slightly different than the regions of space nearby, and this is known as spacetime curvature. 

An object will move through each small region of space with a constant speed and direction just like Newton's 1st law of motion, but the speed will be different when it moves to a different region of space due to the curvature. The path it traces out is called a spacetime geodesic and it's the path followed by any object in free fall (no forces on it other than gravity) like a falling apple or an orbiting planet.

The existence of particles of mass 0 and spin 2 (gravitons) is one of the few options available in quantum field theory, and the existence of particles with mass and spin is due to having a quantum state that is symmetric under rotations in space and time. 0 mass means the gravitons move at the speed of light, spin 2 means they are symmetric when rotated by 180^o (which is related to the fact that they cause an attractive force).
Don Manuel is correct, but [here](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html) is a good reference to help put the concept into clearer view. See section 7-7 for more detail.

Mass or Energy warps space-time, and that curvature from "less-density" space to "high-density" space causes other masses to fall toward each other.

Kinda hand-wavey because I don't understand the details myself, but that's my understanding of gravity.
You might be familiar with this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8

Any why explanation has to take something for granted. Science is about describing the minimal starting points for these why questions. Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces, meaning, it's where the starting point for "why" questions is.

The best one line description of what gravity is, is due to Wheeler:
"Mass tells space-time how to curve, and space-time tells mass how to move."
Alright [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NblR01hHK6U) does the best job I have seen describing the connection between GR and gravity. Yes there is no gravitational force in GR, instead gravity is an artifact of existing inside an accelerated frame of reference due to curved space time. Now this may only give you more questions but on the other hand you might come out of it understanding a little more about the universe around us.

Edit: if you like this kind of stuff [PBS space time](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g/featured) is one of the greatest series out there for explaining complicated astrophysical concepts.
The short answer is "we don't really know, yet."
Your mom
Kerbal scientist here. Well gravioli ofcourse!
Wow, okay, thank you all so much for your answers, I understood at least parts of all of them I think. The "why" question hole I seem to be digging at just seems to go down to deep, dark, unexplained places, but thanks for shedding some light on at least part of the tunnel. I'm gonna do my best to go through all of your comments soon, so expect further questions!
Thanks again!
Einstein said there is no such thing as a gravitational force. Mass is not attracting mass over a distance. Instead, it's curving spacetime.
Things are just falling into each other
Someone correct me but isn't it because of an object's mass? 
Quantum entanglement?
A very hot idea nowadays is that gravity is a manifestation of quantum entanglement. The [holographic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle) has led to some big developments in recent years, most significantly the [AdS/CFT conjecture] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence), which posits that spacetimes with gravity are dual to (i.e., equivalent to) quantum field theories that live in one fewer dimension. Though the correspondence is unproven, it has been verified in many toy models and has been successfully implemented in condensed matter systems liked the [holographic superconductor] (https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1563). 

About ten years ago, [Ryu and Takayangi] (https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0603001) discovered a very important link between the dual theories. Specifically, the [entanglement entropy] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_of_entanglement) in the quantum field theory can be calculated from the area of a surface in the gravitational spacetime. People are now trying to reverse engineer this: i.e., if I start with a quantum field theory with a certain configuration of states and therefore a known entropy, can I construct a dual spacetime? 

This idea is still very young and has not yet been connected with anything very close to reality. However, if developed further, it could help to explain what gravity is by connecting it with the equally-mysterious property of entanglement. A (technical) summary can be found in a two-month old review [here] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01287). I haven't been able to find an ELI5 description.
Gravity is one of my favorite subjects. In the ancient times, one hypothesis was that an object that you drop "wants" to reach a certain place. That is why it moved to this place, and then came to rest.

Gravity, seen as a force, behaves a little funny. It attracts heavier things more than light things. This wasn't generally understood in ancient times. It was obvious that a heavy object would fall faster than a light object, and experimenting was not a common practice.

Was it Newton that first understood in detail, and could formulate the mathematics behind it? There are some funny things here. If you drop a canon ball, it'll take about one second to hit the ground. If you shoot a canon ball exactly horisontal, it will still take one second to hit the ground (if you disregard uneven terrain and assume a plat ground). That can be understood fairly easy. But if you shoot a laser exactly horisontal, it will still take one second to hit the ground (given the same assumptions). The funny thing is that light have no mass, and still "gravitational force" bends it.

In the ancient times, an object at rest was defined as when it it stopped moving. That was the natural state, and applied to everything. Newton realized that it would continue to move, unless there is a force applied. Velocity would stay the same, unless a force is applied. Gravity was seen as a force, which explained why a falling apple accelerated towards the ground.

With Einstein, some of this was turned around. If gravity is not a force, then a falling apple does not accelerate towards the ground. It is the observers standing on the ground that accelerate. That is why they feel the push from the ground.

A thing I can't understand: Forces of nature seem to be mediated by particles. But there has been no such particle identified for gravitation ("graviton"). But if gravitation is really curved space, and not a force, couldn't it be the case that there is no particle involved?

I probably jumbled some concepts here, feel free to correct me.

> Just wondering what inherently causes the attraction of objects to one another.

Gravity doesn't only have an effect on objects, it will effect any frame of reference.
A very simple description I like is that most things in the universe want to have a potential energy of 0. When you're 1000 miles above the earth you have a huuuge potential energy, but when youre on the surface your potential energy is 0 relative to earth.
[Inherently](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/inherently)?

Special relativity says gravity is the consequence of the uneven distribution of mass and energy in the universe.

But then consequences are different from an inseparable attributes.


Something to do with particles that are affected by the uniform higgs field that give them mass and cause them to interfere with other particles that have mass. I'm sure the r/askscience guys could be more technical. 
This proof is basically the same as the usual one. The fact that the last  expression equals zero follows from the same reasoning as the usual proof by contradiction. So this proof is just a vaguer version of the usual one.
Not physics, but i thought it was cool enough to put here anyway.
Or, just say that assuming there are just "n" prime numbers p1, ... pn, then:
p1 * p2 * ... * pn + 1 is larger than all the primes and yet indivisible by any one of them (since dividing by any prime produces the remainder 1 rather than 0), therefore it's prime itself. QED.
> There must be some p that divides 1 + 2P

why?

edit: okay. suppose there is no such p, then 1+2P is prime which contradicts that P is the product of all primes. 
I'm not sure I understand.  Doesn't entropy spontaneously decrease in the short term in classical systems anyway?  Also, how would a quantum Maxwell's Demon succeed where a classical one failed?
Well sure, if it's local enough you can of course circumvent it, since it's statistical in nature :p.
>lays out a possible avenue to a situation where the Second Law is violated on the microscopic level.

Which has always been true, since the Second Law is a law of large scale and/or long term statistical averages. Saying you can violate it at the microscopic level is like saying I can flip ten heads in a row. Sure I can, but on average you're going to get nearly as many heads as tails.
This is why philosophy is useless.
> by the end of the run we were regularly operating at 30 % above that.

With a record 50% above the design value despite a lower number of colliding bunches. The machine exceeded many of its design values. An amazing job by the machine operators and everyone else involved in keeping the machine running.
Off topic, but I like how they cleverly set up the site's CSS to make it so you can't select the "Opinion:" part of the headline, so people won't accidentally copy-paste it. Them having their own TLD is also cool.

It's weird how CERN seems really good at Web technology. ;)

Right.

Or expectations were deliberately  set far lower than actual capabilities.

Scottie used to do it to Kirk all the time.

One funny place is in the equivalent resistance for [this infinite set of resistors](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/73713/equivalent-resistance-in-ladder-circuit?noredirect=1&lq=1) (if all resistors have resistance R, the equivalent resistance is phi*R).
The answer is: (1/2 + 1/sqrt(2)) = 1.207.  Not the Golden Ratio.  

Try using the height h=v^(2)/(4g).  

Edit:  The height of the second projectile should be the "range" or "horizontal distance" of the first projectile.  The answer is the Golden Ratio.  Thank you /u/GanymedeNative and /u/ISimplyDivideByZero. The picture OP provides is helpful (https://imgur.com/gallery/Ps3kI).  Nice find /u/adraria. Thank you for editing the wording.  
Or as I like to say, `5^.5*.5+.5=Phi`
Oh, another place where this real algebraic number is the solution to a ubiquitous polynomial. *Yawn*. Call me when you find a cool thing with a transcendental.
I had it show up in another weird place:  If you have a buoy sitting in waves attached to a spring and a mass at the bottom that you want at a certain depth, and the waves are rolling by at a certain angular frequency and amplitude and stuff, and you set up all the Differential EQ's, and solve for the spring constant that will keep the mass as stationary as possible, and you set all the possible variables to be equal to 1, then the spring constant you get is the golden ratio.   ....wtf?
Thank you. It's information like this that makes the world a better place. 
Awesome!
The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are used in coupling angular momenta. So they show up when you take matrix elements, which give you the probabilities of certain processes happening.

It's hard to explain how to read a Clebsch-Gordan table over text, but do you know how to couple angular momenta?

If I asked you to add two spins of 1/2, what would the basis states be in both the coupled and uncoupled bases?
Are you using a text?  It would be much easier to explain if we can point you to explanations instead of re-inventing the wheel.

Also, you must completely understand CG coefficients in the context of addition of angular momentum before you can understand it in context of particle decay.  See an intro QM text like Griffiths for that, or even wikipedia.   See also the Wigner-Eckhart theorem.

If I understand you correctly, you're not asking about angular momentum, but the internal isospin symmetry.
I like the idea of axions, and I like the machines that try to detect them. Maybe they'll even be real!
You learn most of data analysis by just doing it, since it is very specialized. Typically you start working with experienced colleagues who teach you the tools of the trade and then go from there. Since you are going into astronomy, there's iraf et al. for optical analysis, aips or casa for radio astronomy, heasoft, ciao, isis for x-ray analysis and a whole bunch of other software packages. Plus a lot of specialized software for the data reduction steps. Which you learn by a) reading the user's manuals and b) working with others. 

Once you have the first analysis done, you will then need to do a lot of statistical analysis, plotting, and so on. What you use there really depends on the environment you're working in. Many people these days use python, just because it is the thing of this decade, but any of the other software packages that people use will do as well. The really important thing here is to also have a well funded background in the statistics and mathematics of data analysis, i.e., do not just use the packages, but understand what they're doing. Good starters here for people in the physical fields is the classic by Bevington and Robinson, "Data analysis for the physical sciences", which I consider a must read. Once you've grappled the concepts there, go and read some of the more modern books on data analysis. For astronomy, Gregory's "Bayesian Logical Data Analysis for the Physical Sciences" is a good starter. Yes, this book is using mathematica, but do not forget that knowing the concepts is more important than the language you're using.

I'll answer from a nuclear physics perspective, but what I say will probably apply well to HEP experiment too.

>For those of you who do a lot of data analysis in your work/research, what do you do and what tools/software do you use?

ROOT for analysis and GEANT4 for simulations.

>Have you read any books on the subject and/or how did you start learning?

It's hard to assign one single subject to "data analysis". I've read multiple books which are relevant to what I do when doing analysis. For starters, I'd recommend the C++ textbook by Lafore if you are not already pretty familiar with programming. I'd recommend the statistics book by Cowan for an introduction to the mathematical/statistical techniques applied in data analysis.

But books aside, the way to learn is to start doing it. It's not something you learn overnight, it's something you learn as you go. You never really *stop* learning things.
Definitely very different from area to area. I can't help you with the astro stuff but I would greatly suggest learning a programming language or two. Maybe python or matlab and c++. These can really make your life so much easier later. You'll never do anything more than once manually ever again haha.
I find "data analysis" to be vague. Different calculations need to be done in different projects.
Material science.
It depends to a degree on what you want to do within aerospace engineering, but I would probably say material science would be most useful, then math (especially if your school's math program has a more applied focus for the minor, depends on the institution). I don't see how an astro minor would do that much for you.
I'll go out on a limb and say do what you want. I wouldn't look and see which one is best for grad school because I don't think they really care. My suggestion is to find something you are passionate about and put time and commitment into that (doesn't have to be a minor)
Just ask older students what kind of questions to expect in the exam.
Where I studied (in germany, so no idea if this is very different compared to other countries), the student association had a website where they uploaded old exams. Only looking at those and learning the answers will usually not help, however combining your studying of the concepts with a look at typical exam questions should yield quite good results.

It's basically how I studied for all my exams. Redo all exercises, read the recommended book at least superficially and look at old exams to get a feeling for the kind of questions to expect.
For simple stuff I use inkscape, it's a basic vector graphics program that you can download for free. It has a bit of a learning curve but can produce really professional looking diagrams. 

I know a lot of people that just use PowerPoint though, and its possible to make that look really good too depending on the application. 

For advanced 3d modelling people generally use solid works. 
Inkscape is almost obligated because it allows for integration of latex code.

And tikz but that's black magic.
MSPaint
I like to just use draw.io because its super simple to use and has all the functionality that you can ever want, but if you want to make something that has to have accurate proportions or more complicated designs I would just use librecad or inkscape.

Blender 3D for 3D graphics, it's nice because of the python integration. I have written a script where I only need to provide the basis of a crystal lattice and Blender will generate a nice crystal structure model for me.

Python with Matplotlib for most of my custom 2D graphs.

And igor pro for ARPES plots simply because all the data evaluation is done with it anyway.
Root, otherwise just c++ with graphics library. 
IPE
My institution has a subscription to CorelDraw, so I usually use that. Inkscape is also a good option. Both have user-made plugins for typesetting Latex formulas, although the CorelDraw plugin doesn't always work that well.

Man I thought I was on the wrong sub for a moment with that gigantic UH logo in the thumbnail. I heard rumblings from friends that he was working on something new. It sounds pretty neat. 
Something I've never quite understood: how do they come up with candidate materials to test for superconductivity?  I mean, I can't imagine it's guessing at random, but at the same time this interfacing technique was proposed back in the 70's and it's taken this long to find a material which demonstrates it.  Is there some way to tell on paper whether a material is going to exhibit superconductivity or is it just lots and lots of trial and error?
There are entire subfields of mesoscopic physics dedicated to induced superconductivity. The title (and article) is rather misleading.

I was an analytical physicist in a small commercial company for a while. I ran samples on SEM or XRD mostly, from prep to reporting. I never opened my work email when I wasn't at work because I'd always done everything due that day so there was no need to check. Work hours were pretty flexible too. Basically any lab tech work would allow for this though with the possible exception of flexibility of hours.
Let's hope that the TMT does not get set back too much.

La Palma is a nice place, with a lot of experience in operating large telescopes as well.
Heavy brown dwarfs are supported by electron degeneracy pressure: electrons are fermions, which means two electrons cannot be in the same state. A higher density means more high-energetic states have to be occupied, which needs more energy. In other words, expansion would release energy - a pressure. Gravitational forces lead to the force necessary to keep the electrons packed together so everything is in balance.

Degeneracy pressure scales with the electron density to the power of 5/3 while gravitational forces scale with density squared (as it is the multiplication of two densities). That is nearly the same, so increasing the density by a constant factor everywhere nearly leads to a solution as well.

It is not exact, for heavier brown dwarfs the core density should increase faster than linear with the overall mass. The outer layers, on the other hand, are supported by the regular repulsion between atoms: the density does not depend so much on pressure, which means it increases slower than linear with the overall mass. Those two effects happen to cancel each other roughly.

Related comments:

* If you make the brown dwarf heavy enough, the core gets dense and hot enough for fusion and you get a star.
* Heavier neutron stars are smaller than lighter neutron stars for the same reason as discussed above.
I saw a couple of days ago, China's academy has the most publications in Nature out of all academies in the world. I guess it's safe to say now that we should start learning mandarin. 
I'm super shit at everything else. 
I was pretty good at math and physics in HS, but I went into college with the intention of doing a pre-med track.  In my second semester, I took Differential Equations II, which included power series solutions.  I thought they were fun to play with, and we had seen the hydrogen atom problem in our Intro to Modern Physics class, so I thought I'd try to solve it on my own.

I discovered, of course, that the first series (for the radial part, I think) has coefficients that look like CONSTANT - i(i+1) in the numerator (where "i" is the index of the coefficient).  If you apply those boring convergence tests you learn in Calc II, you find that that series diverges... unless, of course, the series terminates.  That will happen if and only CONSTANT = n(n+1), where "n" is some integer.

Keep going and you find two more such integers.  Only after I was finished did I realize that those constants are exactly the "quantum numbers" from high school chem, which label the states of the electrons.  I was absolutely giddy - I felt like I understood something that not even my old teachers knew.  I knew where those constants came from, why they had to be integers, why "l" had to be strictly less than "n", etc. 

That interplay between what seemed like pure, mechanical mathematics and the physics of energy and angular momentum flipped a switch in my brain and I became voracious in my consumption of physics.
I was drawn to it for a similar reason. I took AP Physics my senior year of high school, and as the year went on, I began to notice that nearly all of the concepts mirrored the stuff I had already learned in calc the year before. Calculus was by far my favorite class in high school, as well as the class that I did the best in, and I just really enjoyed being able to apply it in physics. Another big factor in my fascination with physics was the realization that nearly every natural phenomenon on earth can be quantized. I have always had this feeling that the structure of the universe at it's core is purely mathematical, and physics really allowed me to see that in a different way.
First few weeks of high school physics dealt with checking units in equation. My teacher randomly explained one equation (angular velocity definition I believe, something of that sort) and I blurted out "that's so cool!"

Apparently I was the only one who thought so--nevertheless it caused me to dig deeper and here I am haha
Math is nice, I teach math. Physics is like math in motion. Therefore it is more complex in a sense. So - learning physics is my next step in understanding this planet. 
I was fascinated by the natural world, it always felt so original. I kept a child's view when he sees something the first time. If this is really the only life that we have might as well use it to understand this world and hopefully do a contribution of mine, however small it is.

I like math, but physics is like math on steroids. Things around us don't give a damn about mathematical logic or aesthetics, they just are the way they are, math is cool, but physics is all about doing the math and knowing what a number mean or an what an logical inconsistency. But what me decide between math and physics was when I got to know that Bell's inequalities are broken in quantum mechanics. 
Nature drew me to physics.

I just finished a 2-year postdoc in China, and based on my experience, I don't think you need to be that worried. If you're in an international subfield, where it's common for people to move around to different countries for grad school/postdocs and to attend international conferences in different parts of the world, then it's likely most of your Chinese coworkers will be able to speak English, and they won't leave you out "in the cold". If there are other foreigners (i.e. non-Chinese) in the group, better yet. One difference I noticed is that the lines between work and social life tend to blur together in China more than in the west, so it's very common for a research group to eat lunch and dinner together regularly, which I think works to your advantage. You can also have a social life separate from your group, but that would be up to you, of course. The major cities in China have expatriate communities that you can tap into.

If you share which city and which university you'd be at, perhaps people can provide more information.

ELI5: Resetting of the atomic clock following thermal processes in radiometric dating. 

I am an accounting major taking an astronomy course so I am not educated on physics. 

My professor was speaking about radiometric dating of rocks here on Earth and explained that radiometric dating is not as effective on meteorites as they have been heated up. Someone asked the question of why this is the case since If uranium decays to lead then the composition of the rock did not change, it is still uranium/lead and other material so how does the atomic clock reset? He didnt really know how to answer it or just could not articulate it. 

This question has been bugging me. Please help. 

Does anyone have concise description of the WKB approximation and why it's useful for bounded states and quantum tunneling? I've had this question an a mock exam and they didn't give us a key of the answers. So I hope you guys would know the answer.

I am a sophmore physics undergrad and feel like I never actually understand what I am doing and have no confidence in my abilities. How do I understand and stop being such an idiot
Hi, I'm having a lot of trouble envisioning/understanding thermodynamics concepts that involve heat transfer and reversibility (so pretty much anything after the first law).

I have encountered the description of reversible/irreversible adiabatic compression/expansion, were Q=0 and the process goes through states of quasi-equilibrium. If I have understood correctly, for an adiabatic process to be reversible the pressure of the surroundings must be equal to the pressure of the system, because otherwise part of the work will be converted to heat so it will be unobtainable as work again.

Two things I'm not sure about:

1) Say we are considering an adiabatic compression process. Q=0, so ΔU=W, the work done on the system. But then how do we lose work as heat in an irreversible process if Q=0? Is it that Q=0 refers only to heat that has passed through the system's boundaries, in which case that is actually 0, and all the work irreversibly lost is gained as heat by the system as a part of the work done on it (for instance viscous forces/friction for an abrupt irreversible change)? So would it be right that we could state the first law as ΔU= W = (work-that-is-potentially-recoverable-from-a-future-reversible-expansion-to-the-initial-pressure) + (work-that-has-been-lost-due-to-friction-in-the-form-of-heat)?

2) In the reverse case of reversible/irreversible expansion, does the same idea apply to the system? Or is it the surroundings that gain heat from lost work? Or do BOTH the surroundings AND the system lose energy in the form of heat for BOTH irreversible cases (compression AND expansion)?

Anyway, after these little things, my main problem is I have never seen a treatment in texts of pure heat transfer (:=anergonic) the way they treat the adiabatic case. But then when they state the second law, they make it a point to talk about heat transferred for the reversible process. Now, I know that the scope of the second law is more far-reaching than pure heat transfer, so it may seem a trivial case to talk about pure heat transfer without any work being done, but since there is no mention of it, I can't understand which of the following cases is true:

1) Is heat transfer in itself ALWAYS reversible, and the only thing that makes a process reversible or not is whether the work is done reversibly or not? And if so, how and why is it always reversible? Could it be that even a finite temperature difference between system and surrounding doesn't matter for pure heat transfer?

2) Is heat transfer in itself ALWAYS IR-reversible, in which case it should be treated explicitly in texts to give a clear picture and avoid confusion? And if so how and why is it always irreversible?

3) Is pure heat transfer in and of itself either reversible or irreversible, depending on the circumstances (like if the temperature gradient is infinitesimaly small or finite and if the system moves through states of quasi-equilibrium) and if so what does it depend on, why and how? (In which case again it should be treated explicitly in texts to give a clear picture and avoid confusion!)

I have found reasons to support and reject all three of these cases, so I concluded that I must ask someone to give me some insight. I stress that I am talking about pure heat transfer with no work being performed (for instance: two otherwise isolated systems brought into thermal contact through a single conducting wall).

Thanks for any help, sorry for the long post.

Cheers
Is the signal detected by LIGO just rapidly modulating gravity or did it also detect some kind of 'wave properties' of gravity?
I rejected University college of London to go to Lancaster university. Did I fuck it up?
EDIT: I really think that I fucked myself and lost a great opportunity.
I majored in computational physics and we referenced work/examples from http://www.opensourcephysics.org/ (ranging from lower level physics courses and into the higher level courses such as quantum mechanics). Be sure to thumb through "An Introduction to Computer Simulation Methods" by Harvey Gould, Jan Tobochnik, and Wolfgang Christian. You may also wish to check out some of Rubin Landau's work (http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~landaur/Books/CPbook/SampleChap1.pdf ).

 Open Source Physics has a myriad of EJS examples ranging from the trivial to very complex.  ( http://www.um.es/fem/Ejs/ and http://www.opensourcephysics.org/items/detail.cfm?ID=7306 ) With EJS, you can jump into modeling using minimum resources, minimum code, and you can scroll through a significant list of examples on the OSP and COMpadre sites ( http://www.compadre.org/stp/ ).
>and programming at the same time. 

as a computational physicist myself, I would comment that if your goal is to "learn to program" in the sense that you want to have skills to maybe do software development some day, the "python + book with computational physics in the title" won't get you very far beyond the absolute basics.  If that's not your goal than the recommendations here are all fine.  But if it is, then just keep that in mind.  No computational physics book I've seen is going to teach you object oriented programming, algorithm design, best coding practices, etc.
I'm sophomore Physics major working in a engineering lab and with a professor on the CMS experiment. I can tell you that we use Python and C/C++ a loooot (especially C), we also use Gnuplot for graphs (mathematica and matlab work equally well), I also use root but that's like C++ and Python, CERN people use that mostly. I learned C++ and Python, using online free resources, I will leave the links here when I find them.

if you have other questions feel free to message me.
A great book to consider is "Computational Physics" by Mark Newman.  It gives great examples and has some cool problems to solve. The book teaches computational methods using Python exclusively. 
Python resource page for use in scientific programming: http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/classes/python-science/

Python libraries for physicists: http://www.nortof.com/b/python-for-physicists-cm601/
I found it can be really challenging to learn both programming and (complex) problem solving with it at the same time. But, worth a shot anyway!

I'd recommend a good book on learning Python (the sidebar on /r/learnprogramming may be a good resource). Working through some of a book would be a good start before jumping into computational physics. Once that is done, I think there is a Numerical Recipes book in Python that would come in handy. Basically it's a book full of useful algorithms to solve a variety of problems. Then working through some simple mechanics problems would be a good start. Also ProjectEuler.com has some math to solve. 

Typed all this on mobile so I couldn't provide as many links as I'd like. But hopefully it's something to use as a starting off point.


1) You are reading way too much into that statement. Sean Carroll is as atheist as they come and at most he could be accused of using flowery language to appeal to a wide youtube audience.  It's like saying "Objects like to be at a state of lower potential energy."  I'm not implying a rock has secret desires, it's just easier language to explain why the rock rolls down the hill.

2) Billions of years vs a few decades.  There has been work on other self replicating systems, but I think many scientists are not trying to reinvent the wheel.  Not really my area of expertise.

3) Activation energy. So it'll stay there unless enough energy has been supplied to get it out.  But in the long term, the sun will consume the earth, protons might decay and if they don't every element might quantum tunnel to fuse into iron.  That oil won't stay down there for an infinite time, eventually it will go to a lower energy state.
It's not that there is a personality driving the process or anything. The second law of thermodynamics isn't necessarily driven by randomness either though. It's a statistical law. The probability that entropy will go up in any system is huge. From my understanding of what Sean said, carbon dioxide has a lot of free energy with no direct chemical reaction to use that energy and life solves that problem, taking the low entropy energy and converting it to a higher entropy energy furthering along the 2nd law. 


Issue 2. There are a lot of people working on abiogenesis. It's kind of a two part problem and we need to figure out how both things happened and how. How self replication happened and how metabolism happened? Which came first and how did the other come about. Sean is suggesting that the energy processing part of life is the more important part. If that is the tendency for energy to go then these processes can happen again and again and eventually through a Darwinian process some kind of replication sticks with it. I think. 


Issue 3. Sure that oil might stay there with all its potential energy for a very long time but eventually it's energy will be used. It might not get used until the sun devours the earth but it will. The universe is on a one way trip to the highest entropy configuration that it could be in. Sun eats earth, stars all burn through their fuel, more black holes form, everything falls in black holes, black holes evaporate due to Hawking radiation, universe is left in highest entropy state it could be in, sparse single particles in a cold dark space. Time loses its meaning in this highest entropy configuration. 
You sound interested in [abiogenisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis).

If correct, then you may find useful information on that page.
Issue 1 - The reactions don't try to "find a way" to sustain itself. Just assume that there are many random reactions. Now some of happen to replicate themselves, or else, the  initial reagents take some basic components available in the environment and build a copy of the reagents. Now you have twice as many self replicating reactions, and soon they will be the most numerous.

Issue 2 - /u/FoolishChemist already pointed out the time problem. The other one is the recipe. No one knows what the minimal self sustaining reaction is.

Issue 3  has been addressed well enough by some such as  /u/FoolishChemist and /u/reverendpariah.
Is there any scientific basis for determining how disordered a system is? For example, it doesn't seem intuative to me that the universe as it is now - mostly vacuum, areas of low density gas and dust and areas of high density like stars and planets - is less disordered than a universe only filled with photons slowly cooling to absolute zero
You'd probably be interested in this paper:

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v537/n7622/full/nature19776.html


Does this answer your second issue?  Autocatalytic, bistable, oscillatory networks can be prepared in the lab using chemicals presumably similar to the pre-biotic earth.

Also, try not to think that life is moving "towards" a specific purpose.  If anything, organisms are simply trying to move away from stress in any way they can.  For example, introns didn't evolve because organisms "wanted" to make their genetic code more complex.  It was an adaptation to rampant retrotransposon activity.

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7626/full/nature20110.html


Antibiotics, restriction enzymes, the CRISPR-Cas system, DNA methylation, splicing, the histone code, and heterochromatin all emerged simply because organisms needed a way to deal with selective pressures at that time.
As others already mentioned, we are not there yet. 

But if we really can get a single theory of everything (i.e. unification of the [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model_(mathematical_formulation\)), gravity, [DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter), [DE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy), ...), it should be **a single equation** like we currently have for the standard model, which is a composite [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory\)) of the different parts of the theory (e.g. [QED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics), [QCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics), ...). 

Also note, that Maxwell's equations can't describe all of EM. It got replaced by QED, like Newton's Theory of Gravity was replaced by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.

> While Maxwell's equations (along with the rest of classical electromagnetism) are extraordinarily successful at explaining and predicting a variety of phenomena, they are not exact, but approximations. In some special situations, they can be noticeably inaccurate. Examples include extremely strong fields (see Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian) and extremely short distances (see vacuum polarization). 

> Moreover, various phenomena occur in the world even though Maxwell's equations predict them to be impossible, such as "nonclassical light" and quantum entanglement of electromagnetic fields (see quantum optics). Finally, any phenomenon involving individual photons, such as the photoelectric effect, Planck's law, the Duane–Hunt law, single-photon light detectors, etc., would be difficult or impossible to explain if Maxwell's equations were exactly true, as Maxwell's equations do not involve photons. 

> For the most accurate predictions in all situations, Maxwell's equations have been superseded by quantum electrodynamics.

From Wikipedia - [Limitations of the Maxwell equations as a theory of electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations#Limitations_of_the_Maxwell_equations_as_a_theory_of_electromagnetism)
dS = 0, where S is the action
[We're working on it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything)
That isn't something that can be done. 
Followup question, which is (perhaps?) closer to what OP had in mind: how many equations fully describe GR and QM?
*In principle* the Lagrangian for the standard model and the Einstein field equations for GR *should* describe all physics, but describing a macroscopic system in terms of fundamental constituents, in *in principle* possible, is usually a) not helpful, and b) not *really* possible. So if you are interested in equations that not only describe physics *in principle*, but actually give you meaningful results, you're probably looking at a much larger number of equations. I severely doubt that any one physicist knows all of them, given how specialized some fields are.
Currently two equations describe all of known physics:

* The Standard Model Lagrangian

* Einstein's Field Equations

We are currently looking for a method to unify these into a single equation, whilst explaining currently unexplained phenomenon.
Define physics.
Yeah, someone posted the "fin du MOND" article here a couple of weeks ago. Nope, turns out the authors of *that* paper were too hasty; their simulations are not even remotely enough to solve the mystery mass-discrepancy acceleration relation, much less kill MOND. Currently the issue remains at "dafuq is going on" level.

I think there's a genuine chance dark matter doesn't really exist and gravity becomes modified at very low accelerations due to quantum gravity effects. Still VERY FAR from certainty, though.
Hey there,

It is hard to suggest safety schools when we do not know how you did in undergrad. I can see you went to UIUC from your post history, but a cursory look doesn't reveal anymore than that. 

The biggest mistake you can make is underestimating just how competitive HET is, especially at the listed schools. All of those schools are very solidly in the "reach" category barring some combination of 90% PGRE, top few % of your class, relevant research experience, etc. 

Given the sheer volume of applications these schools receive, much of their analysis is based off the quantitative aspects of your application, and any weaknesses in these aspects are disqualifying.
Which area of HET are you looking at? It strikes me as odd to have string theory as a backup option, since those groups tend to be more selective and smaller than pheno groups.

Most UCs have a good program, but with different focus. For instance, UCLA does a lot of scattering amplitudes while UCSC has close ties to SLAC and has a lot of breadth. Cornell is not easy to get into. Not sure about admission prospects at Stony Brook but they're doing great work in dark matter detection and have some real heavy hitters in collider and Higgs physics. Pittsburgh is good with collider stuff and more astroparticley things. Washington has a strong lattice group and they've got some big names in model building. So yeah, if any of those things appeal to you apply to those schools.

Look at a bunch of schools for groups and professors that you'd like to work with, look at their preprints and see if you'd like to work on the same type of stuff. Honestly, if you do that you'll be way ahead of the curve. Ask your letter writers for advice on where to apply.
I haven't look at the physics rankings in a while, but what about CU. I don't know where they are with your research interests. But it is respected and has good faculty.
This is the dude who worked out the physical consequences of an SO(4) lorentz group for a book, right? My roommate keeps on recommending him, maybe I'll give him a shot.
His *permutation city* is also really good.
I'd also highly recommend [*Dragon's Egg*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dragon's_Egg) by Robert L. Forward (1932 -  2002), American physicist and science fiction writer. His fiction is noted for its scientific credibility, and uses many ideas developed during his work as an aerospace engineer.
As a non-scientist it was a tough but rewarding read.
I'd also tentatively recommend Alastair Reynolds *Revelation Space* series. I found his science to be believable 

Edit: spelling.
It was a memorable read for me. One of the books that represents for me the value of science fiction. I see it as a spiritual descendant of Flatland by A. K. Dewdney.
All of Greg Egan's books are the best of very hard sci-fi. "Schild's Ladder" also contains amazing physics, as well as the "Arrow of Time" trilogy and "Quarantine." You need at least a BS in Physics to get through some of his books, if not a Ph.D.
My astrophysics prof once knew a guy who was writing a sci fi novel about life on a neutron star.  Supposedly one day he asked how the novel was going:  "Well I figured out all the physics, so that's a start," he said. 

My professor then asked about the plot.  "Oh I'll figure that one out later."

The book turned out to be "The Dragon's Egg," and judging by the wiki for the book it was pretty successful, so kudos to him.
Red/Green/Blue Mars
All Greg Egan books are pretty interesting. I found his interpretation of the thermodynamic arrow of time rather iffy in his other book, but regardless, most science fiction novels don't even approach his level of scientific accuracy.
I'd also recommend Solaris by Stanislaw Lem if you don't like technobabble sci-fi filled with tropes and prefer a good story. 
Egan writes "hard scifi" - i.e. scifi that tries to play cool with the known rules of science. He may invent a hypothesis or two, but then his world remains consistent with that assumption, and with the rules of logic.

Another good example from his writings is the Orthogonal series - "A Clockwork Rocket" and the rest. The science part of this series is actually pretty intricate. I had to slow down initially to make sure everything was digested properly. But then it was very interesting to follow the story, which, again, followed whatever conclusions came out of the initial assumptions, no matter how weird.

Self-consistency is important for hard scifi, and Egan does it well. He's perhaps not the most brilliant novelist out there, but he has excellent control over the narrative as it emerges logically from the rules of the game. If you have a taste for intellectual stimulation with a flavor of science and logic, his books are a good choice.
While we're doing recommendations, I'd like to add the Red Mars series by Kim Stanley Robinson. I'm only halfway through but so far there is a lot of believable science in it, and a lot of detail about how exactly the characters get things done while colonizing Mars.
Another thing I'd recommend that's a bit out there but should definitely be read by everyone: Dragons Egg.
Just ordered. The best deal (by far) was for a used paperback on Abebooks.com. Not sure why it's so expensive on Amazon.

Thanks for the recommendation. Love me some hard sci fi.
While we are on the subject, a lot of the physics in the mass effects games is well done and believable, especially if you read the descriptions of the solar systems and planets. For example there is a planet in the game that is tidally locked to its star, creating a permanent hot side, cold side, and a permanent storm between the two. A certain character lives in an aircraft that constantly flies inside the storm in order to hide, which syphon a electricity from the Lightning. As another example, there are some species who can't possible share diseases because their biomolecules have the opposite chirality.
Quarantine and his short story collections are also fantastic, there's only a couple of books he's written that I didn't enjoy.
Sounds like this author has some interesting reads. Thanks for the tip!
I knew a guy doing his master's in physics named Greg Egan. I wonder if people get him confused with the author.
Three dollars for the kindle edition? Sold.
my recommendations are the Hyperion Cantos and anything by Julio Verne
As fiction, I just couldn't get into Egan's books. I wanted to like his books but just didn't find the writing particularly compelling or the characters interesting.
You should check out the Three Body problem and it's sequels. They are great books, with great story, and believable physics. Especially in the first two books. I devoured each book within a week of them being released. They're great. 
Downvote me, I'm a bookmark! 
Muons primarely decay into high-energy electrons and neutrinos (anti-Muons produce neutrinos and positrons). You can't do anything with the neutrinos, they'll zip right through the Earth without interacting with anything, but in principle you could try to collect the energy of the electrons. The easiest way would simply to harvest the heat generated by these electrons as they impact matter and slow down. For examlle, placing a basin of water next to a sufficiently brilliant source of neutrons would cause the basin to boil, which can be used to drive a steam turbine. An alternative option would be to use [Muon-catalyzed fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon-catalyzed_fusion) which relies on the fact that if a hydrogen molecule reacts with a Muon, the muon pulls the hydrogen atoms so close that they undergo fusion, and then use the heat of that fusion reactor to drive a steam turbine.

The biggest problem is getting the muons. They do come from outer space but their density is very low. Producing energy from them would be like trying to produce energy from bird chirps. We can also produce them ourselves, but then we'd need to put in more energy than we'd get out which defeats the entire point.
It depends on the environment. A common situation is in a fine grained particle detector (CMS or ATLAS, for example (note that the M in CMS stands for muon)). In that case, muons lose energy at a pretty high rate, given by dE/dx. If the detector is large enough, all of the energy of the muon will be deposited and its energy can be determined calorimeterically, just as with photons and electrons. Another way that muons are measured is with scintillators or Cherenkov water tanks (Pierre Auger, Telescope Array, and IceTop come to mind) where an atmospheric muon deposits some amount of energy in the scintillator/tank. This doesn't provide information on the muon energy just timing and rate information.
The muons have a total power of the order of a few microwatts per square meter, or a few watts per square kilometer. Compare this to the 1000 watt per square meter we get from the sun. Even if we could magically harvest the whole energy of all muons, it would be utterly negligible.
Trying to find initial conditions for a semiclassical Einstein-Yang-Mills black hole model. Hoping to find some well behaved analytic solution near the black hole horizon which I can then numerically evolve towards the singularity where hopefully my modified equations of motion will actually cause the singularity to be avoided. 

Do any of you happen to have a good source on Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes?
lectures started 3 or 4 weeks ago. this semester i got "particle and nuclear physics" ,  "solid-state physics"  and "thermodynamics and statistical physics".

so far my favorite one is "particle and nuclear physics". ss-physics is fairly unexciting and "thermo and stat" is rather simple atm but i have heard that it is one of the harder courses overall.

the main workload however is going to be because of some practical work we have to do. basically every friday until christmas. 

we were told that it will take 8 hours of preperation, 8 hours of work in the lab and 8-25 hours to analyse the data and write a report.

atleast we got topics we liked, although we didnt get our favorites.

we got: 

"beta-decay"

"lifetime of myons"

"Photoemission spectroscopy"

"optical emission and absorption spectrums"

"nuclear reactor"

"transversal vibrating reed magnetometer"

"Optical coherence tomography"

"activity determination of radioactive samples"

 first one starting this week.

also had to get more familiar with latex.

we are done with the first one now. doing the experiment was rather relaxed. you start a measurment, wait a bit, switch sample and start over. the harderst part was getting the dos program to work. atleast we could put the data onto a usb driver directly and didnt have to go the route where you put it on a floppy disk and go to the only guy in the building that still has a fdd.

what took/is taking the longest is actually making the diagrams and doing the report. its not hard, but just a lot, and it gets really frustrating when you realize you made a mistake and have to redo a couple hours of work.

I'm working on material outgassing in a vacuum. Unfortunately, we have not gotten the system pumping down to a low enough pressure, so we cannot start recording actual data yet.
Trying to understand hydrodynamics in curved space-time as I'm trying to begin a new project on magnetic fields in the early universe. 

Getting nowhere yet. 
Working on a space physics worksheet. I swear the person running the course decided to cram all of the difficult work into the last assignment. I don't know if it's because it's late or what but I can't for the life of me figure out how to derive the E cross B drift. It seems like it should be simple but ugh...makes you question whether you are in the right field if you can't do it.
Learning some theory of distributions, differential geometry - linear connection on manifold, quantum field theory and beginning in-depth study of representation theory which is core topic of my master thesis. 
Doing many annoying derivations for a thermodynamic model of the electron-hole gas in SiO2. Good revision of undergrad calculus.
So i mean since it's quite obvious that all of physics couldn't possibly explain this circumstance we must jump to the next line of valid reasoning. GHOSTS!!
This looks like a pressure drop between the rooms creating a small vortex at the door frame.
So it could honestly be anything?
In essence, you don't. Anything with more than 2 bodies does not have analytic solutions you can calculate (this is known as the 3-body problem). The only way to proceed is numerically, you make the assumption forces don't vary for a short time, integrate the motion, then recalculate the forces. There is a lot of sophistication you can add to this but fundamentally that is it. n-body dynamics is an active area of astrophysical research an this is all anyone is really doing (again, with vastly more sophistication).

If you want to use a n-body code and look at the results of some small simulations there are open source code you can use like [gadget](http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/).  If you're only interested in it as a mathematical problem I'm afraid you're out of luck.
If computing speed wasn't a limitation, you could use an Euler method type scheme where you compute the forces at a given time, update the velocities and positions, and repeat. This isn't used in practice because the computation time scales as N^2. You might get some insight into a more practical solution from Volker Springels's GADGET, a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code which scales as N log N.

https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0505010
Others have suggested finding a shitty job, if you need the income then perhaps that's fine, but I would suggest finding a research group to work with. Ask your professors for any ideas, some national labs offer year long/summer opportunities for undergrads/recent graduates (and they pay).
This is what my professor told me about taking a gap year. Get a shitty job. Not a real job. Like making coffee at starbucks or something. Something that you'll hate doing. That way you'll be more willing to go back to school, because he said if I stopped school, got a real job, and started making money, I'd like it too much.
I did that, it was a good decision.
I took a gap year after graduating from undergrad. I worked for a few months, and then went traveling for the next 10 months with the money I saved. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made, I had the time of my life, and I only stopped traveling because I had to start grad school.

I was very lucky that I didn't have any loans to pay off, and had a decent amount saved to travel for that long. If you can afford it, I absolutely would recommend it.

In my opinion, people (including myself) think way too linearly about how to go through life (college, work, grad school, whatever). Taking the time off to travel opened my eyes and I gained a lot of perspective about what I wanted to do in the future. 

Even if you're spending the time at an engineering job, that's still a great experience to have before doing grad school. You may find passion in your work, or you may find that you don't want or need to go to grad school.
I would say it's not necessarily a bad idea, provided youre working somewhere. Ideally you always want to be doing something that can be added to your cv. 
You've got a lot of good responses, but I'll add my vote. I went directly from undergrad into an engineering PhD, and I wish I had taken more time to find a research group. It is critically important that you find an advisor and group working on something that excites you. If taking a year off will help you find that, then do it!
I'm taking a gap year to do research with the group I want be a graduate student in. It doesn't get more relevant than that!

Otherwise, try to stay in academia, through SULI or some other post-bachelor position with another professor's group. You can work 30-40 hours a week in a lab and you'll still feel like you have more time to actually study for the PGRE if you want to take it again. As long as you can really justify the time off then it shouldn't hurt you.
If you think you need to do it, absolutely do it.
I didn't take a gap year and I just started my MSc.

I'm REALLY regretting not taking a gap year. I was too burnt out for this semester. I'm in a really bad place with my academics now.
I took a gap year and studied for the PhD. I successfully placed into a top school after studying for and doing well on the GRE. So it's possible provided you have the resolve to study diligently. That means every day for the summer. Let me know if you'd like study suggestions.

However, rather than taking a shitty job as others recommend, might I suggest you look into [post-baccalaureate research associate](http://science-ed.pnnl.gov/default.aspx?topic=Post_Graduates_Research_Assistance_-_Post_Bachelors,_Post_Masters,_Post_Doctorate) jobs during the interim? It would keep your physics sharp and also help your admissions results.
I was always told that taking a gap year _significantly_ hurts your chances of getting into grad school (and also hurts your performance once you do get in), unless you spend that year working in the field you expect to be researching once you start grad school. I see some people here are saying the opposite, so I guess that isn't universally true... but still, it's probably smart to check with the departments you might consider applying to, and specifically with the professors you'd want to work with (if you know), to see what they say.
If you feel burnt on classes and homework and you're generally very tired, maybe you should take a gap year. Not just because of these reasons, but to clear your mind little bit and perhaps study in advance so you can be ready when classes start. That way you'll have nice momentum and won't be confused with all new stuff you'll gonna learn on lectures.

Making a short brake (one year is not a long time in terms of education, trust me) is always a good thing and it can turn out to be much better solution than going straight to GRE. I wish I made that brake when I had a chance... Good luck with your decision!
A gap year as in traveling/doing non-physics things? No way. You won't stay sharp enough. 

A gap year as in studying/learning/preparing for grad school? If your work ethic is good enough, sure. If you're going to spend that year learning it's for the better.

I left academia 10 months ago and have already forgotten an absolute ton of information. No question about it, I'm considerably worse as a physicist right now than I was a year ago. 
I'm doing the same, mostly because i didn't sign up for the pgre this semester for financial and personal reasons. I would reccomend talking to your advisor / admissions commitee. Mine recommended teaching high school and continuing my research for a year while i study for pgre and apply. Good luck!
I'm in the same boat. Maybe I'll try to find an internship over the summer. Best of luck!
Get a job and / or student exchange
Do it! My best recommendation is to find a job or internship in that gap year that is somewhat related to science/uses analytic skills. You mentioned an engineering job, that could be very useful if you want to pursue experimental work in grad school. Doesn't have to be all year and doesn't have to be directly physics related; sometimes it's nice to have extra skills!

I applied to grad school my 4th year of college and was rejected. Didn't have a great physics GRE and moderate research experience. So I applied to some internships and in my gap year I did two SULI internships at department of energy national labs. It was a great experience, I was exposed to different fields in science, and it gave me a letter of rec. Meanwhile I didn't have classes to worry about so I could dedicate more effort to physics GRE studying and the application on a whole. 

Re-applied the next year and got into one of my top choices. The gap year helps give you some time to breathe and figure out your life. I highly recommend it!
Do it, and take a real job. It was a big sanity saver for me, and it made GRE studying and applications so much easier since I didn't have classwork! It is also experience that differentiates you from other candidates for jobs post-PhD, and if you do it well, it helps you expand your network. Plus you might end up with some actual savings and not be 30 with an empty retirement account.
I really wish I had taken a year out in the middle, was just so burnt out and my final degree suffered. Here your first 2 years dont count towards your degree at all so I dnt matter than I had burnt myself out getting good grades 1st and 2nd year because the 2 years that counted after were crap coz I was fried in the brain department so I dnt get the 1st class I wanted.
Gap years are better than ever now with MOOCs.  Study hard for free in the year off, and then know lots of the course material already when you get to your first year.  Who knows, colleges might someday not even be needed anymore if the online courses are good enough.
I did a gap year working in a lab. I can't say whether it hurt my chances or not, I didn't have to test the waters as I did grad school in the lab I worked in. 

The first few months I was just volunteering, and I worked as a server at the same time. It was a good decision as far as I'm concerned. It gave me the chance to do research in a low stress environment (there's no pressure on volunteers). 

The concepts I learned in undergrad became more clear when I saw them in my research. When I went back to grad school, I was more careful in choosing my courses because I knew what I wanted to learn to help me succeed in my research.

If there is an opportunity to work in a lab, I would recommend a gap year it was a great experience for me.
Took a gap year, got a mediocre job in an amazing place. Best decision I ever made. I think a compromise would be a good idea. Perhaps get a crappy job to cover expenses but do research in spare time, or read ahead in your textbooks. What you should probably not do though is hang around your college town and reap the rewards of an undergraduate lifestyle with minimal responsibilities. That can get comfortable which is kinda scary...
OK.  Back up.  Think about it non-mathematically.  The electron is just sitting there at rest, minding it's own business.  When, out of nowhere, an electric field is applied.  Let's really look at the form of the electric field: (get the LaTeX script, see the sidebar)

[; \boldsymbol E(t) = \boldsymbol E\_0 \sin(\omega t) ;]

It's sine.  *It goes as sine*!  You can't hear my voice.  I'm not being condescending.  I'm trying to push you to think about what happens.  **Stop now and think about what happens.**  

Imagine it in your head.  

Let time flow slowly.  

What's the initial force at time t=0 (magnitude and direction)?  

OK.  Then what?  Follow along in your mind for 1/2 cycle of the sine wave.  What do you see?  What is the *force* doing?  What is the electron motion?

The force was always in the same direction during that half cycle, wasn't it?  WASN'T IT?  :)  

Yes.  Yes, it was.  

So now at the end of the first half cycle (when [;t=\pi/\omega;]), what's the force (magnitude and direction)?  What about the velocity of the electron (direction is enough)?

OK.  So now let time flow for the *second* half-cycle.  What is the *force* doing?  Which direction is it pointing?  What is happening to the electron as a result?

After one full cycle, what is the velocity of the electron (magnitude and direction)?  What about its position relative to its starting point?  Exact numbers aren't important here; you're just trying to understand.

So that's it.  If you can follow what happens for *one* cycle, you've got the whole thing.  It just repeats after that.  Does that take care of it?  I hope this format was helpful and not frustrating.  I personally believe that you learn more when you figure things out yourself, even with a little guidance.

If this was just totally unhelpful.  Let me know and I'll just say the answer in one or two sentences.

e: typos, derp.

Imagine that the electric field follows a simple oscillating form in the x-direction

E=Eo sin (wt)

Then applying Newton's second law we have that

mx''=qE=qEo sin(wt)

Which is an inhomogeneous second orden differential equation in time. It's solution is given by the superposition of the homogeneous solution (mx''=0) and a particular solution with an oscillating form (x=A sin(wt) + B cos (wt))

The first equation tells you that the acceleration is cero. So the electron must be moving with constant velocity. And the second equation gives you an oscillating term. So yeah. Thats why
This sounds like they're trying to paint the classical picture of photon pressure in a roundabout way. An oscillating electric field will, in turn, create and oscillating magnetic field perpendicular to the oscillations and phase offset. The electron will then move up and down with the electric field, and then be pushed forward by the magnetic field.

Unless I've misunderstood the question. In which case I'm not sure what they're trying to get at.
In quantum field theory, existence is a slippery term. There is a [famous paper by Art Hobson](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.4616.pdf) where it is argued that particles don't even exist, they are only a useful analogy when the real object is the underlying quantum field. 

Quasiparticles are about as 'real' as a electron, though they exist one level of abstraction further. How you react to that is up to taste.

Essentially, the quasiparticle electron is a useful fiction describing the properties of a huge swathe on the order of Avagadro's number of electrons interacting with each other and some lattice, each of which is as I said a useful fiction describing the 'real' electron field, though at this point nobody really knows what's 'real'. 

Physicists are often much more concerned with what are empirically observable than what's real, and from that point of view the quasiparticle electron is just as empirically observable as the electron, it's just less fundamental.
I think you are confusing between different renormalization scales. "Real" is a very fishy word.
Your language is very imprecise (understandably, it's English), and the question is rather vague, so it's hard to know what you're looking for. Please correct me if I'm misunderstanding you, but I think you've got the wrong idea about what people are claiming.

When people say that Majorana fermions were discovered in a material, nobody is claiming that there exist *elementary* or *fundamental* Majorana fermions. It means that there exists a particle-like excitation within a material which, if you look at how it behaves at low energies, can be well-modelled as a Majorana fermion. Majoranas are (claimed to be) "real" in this sense.

If this still bothers you, let me ask you: are protons "real"? The object that we call a proton is really a low-energy description of three quarks (which isn't really accurate either because the strong force is complicated). Does this mean that a proton isn't "real"? You can answer that question however you like depending on your definition of "real," but it's hard to imagine an empirically-minded definition under which the proton isn't "real."
Heh ... I recall an answer to a similar question given by a condensed matter physicist that went like this:

"In condensed matter physics, we call quasiparticles by a different name:  particles."

Whether they are fundamental or emergent is not exactly important ... if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck and it is taxonomically indistinguishable from a duck, then it's a duck.  Quasiparticles can be successfully described as particles by the appropriate equations governing particle behavior; accordingly, they do qualify as actual particles, just not elementary ones.  It is perhaps best to think of them as an emergent phenomenon, but they are still a real phenomenon.
If particles are just excitations within all the fields that exist in the universe, the fields exist in 3D, right? Or, que to quantised space, is it more like layers and layers of sheets very close together? Arey they orientated in any particular way, or are they not like fabric, but points that snap to quantised points that either gain or lose energy, like glowing dots on a grid? I'm struggling to picture it (I guess it can't really be imagined.. especially with addictional dimensions)
It would show you Earth 8 years ago. Light reflected off of Earth would take 4 years to get to the mirror, and then 4 years to get back.
>I could see what happened at my house ~~four~~ eight years ago, right?

It's pretty hard to see a house from a distance of 8 ly, so no not really.  I mean you could make the mirror outrageously huge and concave to focus the light back to you.  You'd basically have to build a spherical mirror of 8 ly diameter and put your house in the center of it.  If you're willing to do that, then sure, absolutely.
Nope.

Scenario: You instantly travel 4 light years distance, place a mirror angled back to your original position, then instantly teleport back to your initial position.

What happens when you look back at the mirror? You see nothing...for four years. You have to wait for the light being reflected off the mirror to reach your original position. 

In 4 years time, you would see what happened 4 years from when you placed the mirror, or 8 years in the past.
Well, yes and no.  If you jad nothing to do with putting the mirror there and it's "just there" than yes.  If putting the mirror there is part of the thought experiment than you can't see any time before you left to put the mirror there.  The reason being that you can't travel faster than the speed of light so yoir journey to place the mirror and come back must necessarily be longer than 8 years.

Of course recording things with a camera is probably an easier solution.
Thanks for all those answers, I definitely got the confirmation now. If I'd place a mirror right now in 4ly distance by snipping my finger, I'd have to wait eight years. Then I'd see what happens 4 years ago. 

Perfect! Thank you all!

Some numbers:

* Typical bond length: 100-400 Ångström (compared to ~1-2 for regular molecules)
* Typical binding energy: 50 GHz or 0.2 meV (compared to eV for regular molecules)
* The lifetime of the molecules is about 20µs.
How strong is the bond compared to a regular covalent one?
I was kind of confused with the title here from Purdue university initially. The tittle seems to suggest "weak atomic bond was observed for first time", but the article itself actually says, "a special type of weak atomic bond was observed for the first time, proving the existence of butterfly Rydberg molecule". 

The article itself is very concise. It's a pleasant read.

Edit: grammar
Can these only be created in a lab, and what's the potential use of the molecule?

Iv just started my masters in physics after finishing my BSc, I have friends studying economics and I think that if you can grasp the maths and models in economics you should be fine with physics. It's all about the time and effort you put in, as long as you are motivated enough to teach yourself maths and apply it to physics you should be fine, good luck!
Your background certainly seems like it would be enough for a physics masters. You would need to look at the admission requirements for specific programs to see if you could get in though. In my country (Australia) your undergrad degree may be considered too far removed from physics to get in. Your research experience says otherwise though so you should be able to find a school that will let you in.
What level of math did you get to with economics? Curious as to what is required.
The math you need is: calculus, vector calculus, PDEs, complex analysis and linear algebra.  I don't know if you have that.  In my past personal experienc, economists and econ majors tend to have very limited math backgrounds and a great aptitude for abusing what they do know, but I'm sure there are exceptions. I honestly don't know, realistically, why a grad school would bother taking a student with no physocs background, even if their grades were stellar.  Wouldn't it be far simpler to take some physics courses before you graduate.
A pretty difficult choice. I have BA's (unfinished) in philology, philosophy, information management. 

I conisider myself gifted with 160 or so IQ, but NO, I wouldn't touch Physics master without engineering/physics/math's BA. 

Please, save some time and do a BA in these fields even if it seems a lot. The highest level of math is so complex, people say that Differential equations are child's game.  So start with BA level maths and get very good at them using any of BA' s I mentioned earlier. 
Who was surprised at the masses?
Not sure how much GW observation will constrain theories in basic physics. But there should be some very interesting things coming out on the astrophysics side: stellar astrophysics, supernovae, GRBs, etc. Numerical Relativity would have been a great field to get started in a few years ago...
I don't believe it will affect any theoretical research. It's not a new thing, it's confirmation of a very old thing. It will, however, lead into a new age of gravitational astronomy.

The biggest factor is not your field of research, but the skills you picked up along the way. Ultimately the one thing employers actually care about is what you can bring to the table. Of course, the specifics will then depend on what exactly you want to do in the "real world." If you want to do a very technical job, e.g. working on new laser systems, then obviously familiarity with building and maintaining lasers will be a huge help. If you want to go into something like data science then what they will look for is a combination of general programming skills and a good understanding of statistics. For consulting, the ability to make pretty presentations and communicate effectively will count more than much of the technical knowledge you amassed put together. 

The best advice I have is try to decide relativity early (e.g. at least a year before graduating) what you want to do afterwards. Then it becomes easier to work on the skills that would make you more employable in your field of choice. For example, for data science you could start putting small projects on Github and polishing them along the way. Then you would have something tangible to show employers that proves you are capable of doing the work. Likewise, you have to start talking to people in those fields. Doing an internship or a brief work visit is one of the best way to get your foot in the door so to speak. Otherwise, even sitting down with people working at similar companies for an "informational interview" might be quite helpful. 

However, I can't emphasize how important it is just to start talking to people in your future field. Networking may sound like a dirty word, but it's incredibly helpful. By talking to people already working in the kind of job you want, you can get a much better sense of what the day to day work is like and what skills are useful. More importantly, by making connections, you can have a contact person to send your resume to the right hiring manager when you are ready to apply for a job. This simple step can be incredibly important as it can offer a shortcut to a phone/site interview. Otherwise you will be stuck dealing with HR as a first step, which can be incredibly frustrating and often fruitless. 
Computational / computer science. Entry level analytics
A solid state physics Ph.D. would be good way to get a job at a semiconductor manufacturer.

Any physics subfield with lots of data analysis (particle physics, astrophysics) would be good for data science jobs.
Accelerator physicists are in high demand - believe it or not only a small % of accelerators are used for HEP research - many are used for things like isotope production, proton therapy and other non-research applications, and these are becoming more common.
Interpretative dance is really hot right now.
Software engineering. I picked up iOS development as a hobby while in grad school. Silicon valley worships physicists. You'll still need demonstrable apps to show off in the app store and what not to get a job, but people tend to assume I'm a genius and ask questions later. 
Medical physics is a great career option. Always looking for them in oncology 
good comment on the situation in germany:

Experimental solid state physics or experimental polymer will probably give you the strongest potential for an industry job that is very close to your field.
The Higgs field is pretty hot, currently...
EM
you were so close with that link
Nothing revolutionary, or likely unexpected. Getting definite proof for the graviton would simply mean that the gravitational field is quantized similar to the electromagnetic (EM) field. Even though it is a pain in the ass to observe the graviton, indirect evidence already allows us to say quite a bit about it. Recently, the LIGO experiments already supported the idea that changes in the gravitational field propagate at the speed of light. As a consequence, the graviton appears to be massless. Also, because we know the graviton has to couple to the stress-energy tensor, we know that its spin must be 2. But like I said, we already think we know many of these properties of the graviton without actually observing it. Of course, it would be exciting if something new popped up. Then we could work on revising our current understanding of physics and perhaps even refine models trying to pull together gravity and particle physics.
isn't graviton just higgs boson, that's what we learnt in physics around half a year ago, and isn't higgs boson allready discovered? 
>if it helps it's also a pipe dream of mine to be an astronaut

I'd hate to trample your dreams but does Australia send people into space?  The US, Russia and China I'd assume are the only games in town for manned space travel.

Regardless, I'd assume that something like Engineering is more on a career path to astronaut than radio astronomy.  I may be showing my own ignorance but radio waves are pretty big so I don't think we do any radio astronomy in space.  See the "kilometer" size of the Square Kilometer Array.

As for astronomy vs. mathematical physics, I'd be inclined to say that mathematical physics offers you more pivots for a post physics career which sadly is a serious consideration that any physics undergrad should consider.  That being said, if your grades are great and you show strong interest at working at the SKA for some undergrad research, I wouldn't imagine it matters too much what courses you've done as long as you're in physics.  At the undergrad level, no one is expecting super specialized knowledge.


This is really up to you, the internet can't really help you here. Personally I think astrophysics is cooler, but that's me.
You should understand that there's an enormous difference between physics textbooks and popular science books "on physics".  Reading a popular science book is a largely unrelated activity to studying physics.  So with this understanding you need to clarify what you mean by an introduction.  

Neil deGrasse Tyson is not a physicist, he's an edutainer and celebrity,  and Stephen Hawking has written no introductory texts (that I know of).  So I assume you mean popular science books.  If your goal is popular science books then I wouldn't imagine it matters to much in what "order" you read them as they're all ostensibly written for a first reader.  However, none of these are "introductory physics books", those would be the books that would be in a Physics 101 class and would require a background in calculus.
I've been reading the Feynman lectures on physics recently. The writing is very clear and entertaining. It's all freely available on caltech's website, here: http://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/
If you're looking for a text book there are a bunch of solid intro level mechanics and electricity books to get you started. University Physics comes to mind as a pretty clear cut book. You'll need to know calculus through multi to do the Electricity stuff though. Another resource would be the Khan Academy physics sequence, primarily because it's free and typically well taught.

If you're looking more for a pop science book series where you can take in a lot of topics from a conceptual level but not mathematically I'd say start by watching Cosmos (since its pretty easy to understand) or some of the science channels one off shows about the universe, at least that's how I got my start. After that you probably can't really go wrong with any pop sci books. They'll be targeted towards people with minimal background. 
Try QED by Feynman. I'm currently reading it and I'm liking it. It's not really "popular" like the usual popular physics books. Read it by yourself and you'll understand what I mean
I'm a big fan of Muncaster or Duncan if you want a general introduction to physics at college level. They're fairly old so you can get them quite cheap
Understanding mathematics, at least through calculus, is essential to understanding physics.  If you haven't taken a precalculus course yet (or if you just need a refresher), start with *Basic Mathematics* by Lang.  It contains most of the prerequisite topics for calculus.  It also contains a nice range of problems from routine computations to non-trivial applications of concepts.  After you finish you can move onto Lang's calculus books: *A First Course in Calculus* and *Calculus of Several Variables*.  And then you're ready for introductory physics!

*Physics* (volumes 1 and 2) by Halliday, Resnick, and Krane is a great introductory textbook because it balances deriving and discussing concepts.  This is a general physics textbook that covers mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, optics, special relativity, and quantum mechanics.  The fourth edition is sufficient and secondhand copies are usually inexpensive.  After reading *Physics* you'll be able to move onto more advanced or specialized topics.  It might also be beneficial to learn more mathematics through linear algebra or probability.  

Good luck and feel free to comment or message me if you have any questions along the way.  :)
I could be wrong- but whenever I hear Penrose speak, his ideas always sound well-formed but unconventional. He simply doesn't care what the general opinion is- he always forms his own ideas based on what he knows.

It takes a special kind of mind to be able to deviate from the norm and still make sense. It's easy to deviate from the norm make nonsense. If you want deviant nonsense ideas, go to youtube.

I think we need more people like Penrose.
Soooooo this guy is saying some outrageous things that hopefully someone who knows more can clear up for me:

* Unitarity doesn't have to be conserved

* The Earth's momentum should be exciting more dimensions

* Coherent superpositions (of high mass) will collapse by themselves (without measurement)

* It is improbable that our universe is expanding uniformly, and improbable that the big bang happened (for the same reason)

Now, unitarity has always felt like, you know, an *obvious* thing. Probabilities sum to 1. The concept of a probability *greater* than 1, simply doesn't *exist* in probability theory.

Then, the Earth's momentum: Doesn't the excitation of extra dimensions have to do with energy *density?* In which case, there's not really a high energy density at any point within the Earth.

As for coherent superpositions: As far as I know, this might be the case, but they would also oscillate to one, then to the other, and so on. This is normal and accepted. He seems to be saying that once they oscillate to one state, they will never go back (period, no case of a long long period of the function).

The last one I don't really know much about, but it seems odd nonetheless.
Interesting question!  I had never heard of this before.

Say you have completed the pulley stitch up to the point shown in the right-hand figure.  I'm guessing the next step is to pull on the threads and the whole thing pulls together and closes up.  You pull with some amount of force, call it T (for tension), on each thread.  The total sideways component of the force, call it Tx, on each side is what actually pulls the wound closed.  But since the thread is stitched through the tissue twice, it pulls on the tissue twice.  So your thread is pulling the wound closed with a force of 2Tx.

So I think that's probably the advantage: the stitch produces a force multiplier.  It would make sense to call it the "pulley stitch" in that case, since a system of pulleys provides a similar mechanical advantage.  From a mechanics perspective, this would be desirable if you wanted to either a) use the same thread tension as in the simple interrupted stitch but get more overall pulling force on the wound, or b) use less tension as in the simple interrupted stitch but get the same overall pulling force on the wound.

As for the spacing of the entry/exit points, I don't think there is any mechanical advantage.  The threads are meant to pull the tissue closed laterally, so it's the force that matters (not torque, which is what leverage multiplies) which is not dependent on the point of application.  I think the spacing of the entry/exit points would only depend on what's good for the health of the tissue.
~75 sigma for accelerated expansion in an unconstrained model, but just 11.2 in a flat universe? How does that work without heavily disfavoring a flat universe? I also don't see the 75 sigma value from the abstract anywhere in the text. The text compares unconstrained to constrained models, where the flat universe leads to a higher significance as expected (also in agreement with figures 2 and 3).

I don't understand this 75 sigma value in the abstract.
Great paper! Lots more sigmas than I thought we had.
This was in response to a paper by some colleagues of mine which did a statistical reanalysis of a large portion of the SN1a data, and found that it is consistent with no acceleration. This new paper that came out the other day seems to say that there are some correlations in the priors that weren't properly accounted for.
Is that not what the Nobel prize winner And Riess from John's Hopkins calculated?
The earth's magnetic field is actually quite a complicated beast. [Here is a picture of the variation in intensity over the entire earth's surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Magnetic_Field_2015.pdf). You can see that, even without accounting for the direction of the field lines, there isn't going to be a simple equation to describe this with any kind of accuracy. 

The next best thing is called the [World Magnetic Model,](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/DoDWMM.shtml) which some generous people have made publicly available for exactly the kind of purposes that you're describing.


My approach was to try to get a job after undergrad and if that didn't work out, go to grad school. I got a programming job within 3 months and have never looked back. I don't think i can go back to the student life. I love getting off of work and not having to worry about homework. That, and money.
Zero regrets.   I did the masters, PhD route, so I was in grad school for 6 years.  Those years were awesome....I was paid shit, but I got to live in really interesting places and do work and play with toys I would never get to touch in industry.  The hours and the workload sucked, but that ebbed and flowed.  I'm much happier with a variable workload like that then the 9 to 5 grind.

After graduation, I did get a job that would have been impossible for me to get without a grad degree.....and it's a pretty awesome job.  I very likely could have been much farther ahead on the net earnings curve if I had started working straight out of undergrad, but my salary would have capped out below what I'm making now.  I also would not be in a position that I enjoy as much as I do my current one.

I think my experience may be atypical though.  My PhD was super heavy in experimentalism...to the point I was doing hardware and software design, systems engineering, planning field campaigns, etc all just to support my actual PhD research.  That 6 years of "full scope" engineering experience is what I think paid off for me in the long run.
I got a physics PhD at Berkeley, then went into industry (Silicon Valley) and never looked back.

Some might consider my degree a "waste", in that I'm not doing physics in my career today. Personally though I view it as a first career: I got a chance to do some interesting research at the cutting edge of my field, and I had a good (albeit poorly-paid) life while I was doing it. I have always loved science and if I'd never done grad school, I know I would have always wondered what I missed.

Also I think the experience has been valuable to my career, if one looks beyond the immediate. Grad school taught me how to work independently and solve analytical problems with no clear answers. That's a skill that can apply to almost anything.
Just started my PhD this semester. I've loved every minute of it so far. I definitely understand physics more, the working environment is fantastic and I'm exposed to more ideas and fields at a different institution than I was at in undergrad. The pay is actually pretty solid and is only a little more than half what I was offered to work in IT out of the gate, but certainly livable. If I had ended up taking the job I'd probably just spend my free time dicking around anyway. You're burdened with more lab responsibility in undergrad which can be stressful but advisors are willing to invest more into you.
Working on my MD currently.

Sometimes I regret it, only because the problem solving that comes with physics seems much more enjoyable than memorizing stuff for 10 hours a day. 

But on the other hand, employment was a huge fear for me. Def don't want to go through 5 years of a PhD, 3 years post doc, and find no work. Didn't want to jump through the hoops of grant requests and chasing tenure like a madman.

Plus, when I go to the clinic, it makes me doing what I'm doing worth it. I miss learning GR and QM and feeling kickass behind a chalkboard, but I realized at some point that physics in my mind was more of a dream than reality.
I just got my undergrad and went straight to work for the state as a health physicist. Money sucks but like the other guy said not having to worry about homework or exams is a dream come true. I don't regret not getting my masters but I'm still open to the idea of going back in a few years while I'm still young and not tied down. 
I started working 6 months after getting my BS in physics, I'm honestly considering going back to school to get a masters because I feel there's not much professional growth working in the industry.
My wife and I both have Master's and we both got jobs that we could have gotten with just BS's. If I had to do it again I wouldn't go to grad school
Yeah, I was accepted to a Phd program in economics, but I don't think it would have really helped my career and would have made my life much more difficult financially and work/life balance. I think it was the right move not to go but I will always regret it.
Grad school is weird. I didn't get into physics grad school, so I shot for scientific computing grad school. Now, after a year and a half in of a PhD, I'm leaving with a masters because I don't want to do school anymore. 

Grad school is for if you want to do academia. 
I'm currently in my second year of grad school and I don't have any regrets. Sometimes I wonder how life would change if I started a career right away, but at the end of the day I'm loving the mix of learning and research. 

Not going to lie, it can be a huge adjustment from undergrad to graduate school--but as a friend put it, when you look back a few semesters in you really see the benefit and strengthened skills. 
I haven't gone back to grad school and I'm regretting it. Could just be where I'm from, there's a small science market, but I need to go back to become specialized in something. Im tutoring for a good company and money is OK but not what I expected 
Did my BS then got a job at a startup company.  Ended up hating the job and went back for my masters one year after graduating.  I went to a school with a terminal masters degree and don't regret it at all.  I feel like I learned way more by pursuing the masters.
I regret enrolling in a physics PhD program. I'm now trying to leave with a master's in statistics.
Started working in IT now and never looked back, I make more than my sister with a law degree and huge amounts of debit. I'm at 75k right now.
Decided at the last minute not to apply to physics grad school and now work in business, rather than academia or industry. I feel wistful about what might have been and do miss working on physics, but in general the lifestyle / money / pace of the life I chose was a much better fit for me. I've heard it said that you should only do a PhD if you can't imagine being happy *not* doing one, which doesn't sound too wrong. A masters isn't a big deal either way, especially if you're funded.
The PhD was the right choice for me, but it's probably *not* the right choice for you.
I haven't even finished my undergrad and I already don't regret not doing grad school. I just don't like school :)
What about pairing a B.S. in physics with a master's in some flavor of engineering?
B.Sc. in Physics with minor in Chem (4.5yr), in the middle of a Masters program (2yr) involving semiconductors and will probably be working on nanotech for my thesis. 

I would have preferred to go straight into work, but I had some other motives for going to grad school (continent change). Don't regret it, but still can't wait to have a real with real money and no homework/exams!

No intention of doing a PhD, but we shall see how life goes...
I got my B.S. in physics and then went straight into a combined master's/PhD program. Unfortunately I was so burnt out with schoolwork that i left after a disastrous first year and joined the workforce.

I'm now a process engineer at a decent sized company making below average pay and with peers who mostly have no formal education and, frankly, I'm sick of dealing with the daily horseshit. 

So yeah, I really regret dropping out of grad school.
I think it is a horrible idea but I don't regret it
I decided not to go to grad school because I thought I had a job directly utilizing my majors lined up. Well the job fell through. Now I work at a call center with brain-dead miscreants. I regret a lot of things.
I regret taking my masters. The marked was primed and looking for people, but I was stupid and chose to stay in school. When I was finally done, the marked was bad, and is still bad. 
I'm looking for work, waiting to start my life. I endure. Learning more. Honing my skills.  

My best friend, he was smart. Got a job straight after his bachelor's. Now he was a wife and a home, with a kick ass job. 

I don't regret the knowledge i have gained, but it sucks not having a job, an income that can realize ones dreams. 

I have a bitter sweet feel for my masters. 

I did have much fun during my masters, but there were more times where I wanted to quit, become a stripper, become an male escort. 

My ramblings. 
Finishing a PhD in computational theory and transitioning to jobs in data science. I do not regret getting a graduate degree as I was able to travel the world and contribute to some rewarding research. It also is a relatively accepted path to gain credentials in data science which pays well and is in high demand.
what you will usually hear is backwards rationalizing.

People don't like to admit their mistakes, therefore they will throw out arguments that come from confirmation bias.

Make up your own mind and think for yourself. Ask yourself why do you ask the question and try to figure out your life!

Best wishes
I'm 29, I teach math. I have unfinished BA in physics which I really plan to continue, eventually working up to PhD if everything goes great. 
Grad school is good up to a point.  Masters is good PhD is mostly bad.

I have three masters and my wife has a PhD.  She thinks it was a waste.
Im currently doing my masters (started about 3 weeks ago), and immediately knew it was everything i wanted after spending two years trying to get a job i wanted to stay in. Then again i knew this was what i wanted to do since i got out of high school because the research format suits me much better :)

Edit spelling cause im drinking right now :)
Second year PhD student here.

I don't regret it, it's a lot of fun to work on research projects that push the boundaries of what's currently being done. Personally, I find those entire research process very fulfilling. Classes can be a drag (it's kind of weird when your friends are starting their lives and you're still up a 2am finishing a problem set), but it's typically only 1-2 years of classes so it's not that bad. Basically, you get to do some cool research for a few years, while learning a lot and making a perfectly decent salary and hopefully picking up some marketable skills.    

But it's easy to see why someone could regret it. Many research projects could be very unfulfilling, due to things like poor advising/unclear research direction (especially early on), long-term projects (where even minor milestones could take long periods of time, which could make some feel they aren't really accomplishing anything), or evolving research interests. 

In purely financial terms, a PhD is likely not worthwhile, but for a physics BS it's probably very much worth it to get a masters as long as it's in something that's not physics. 
Defended my PhD thesis last June, finally got my degree conferred in may. Been searching like hell since about January for a job.  I haven't found anything. Part of this may be due to the fact that I didn't have a single equation in my thesis (did tissue engineering research), but I've applied to so many different things, and it just doesn't seem like anyone wants to hire me for anything. I've even applied to many jobs with just a BS requirement, no callback, no interviews for private sector positions. I had one interview for a postdoc position, but I didn't hear back from them. I've done a lot of networking in my area (St. Louis), and I'm just exhausted from searching.

From my experience, grad school was miserable ( I would recommend having some part of your life figured out first, either a dream job or having a stable relationship for support.) Because you need to dig a shitload of motivation in order to finish in the first place. 

DONT DO UNLESS YOURE 100% sure
I left after 2 years with my masters but I don't regret it at all.  I was a PhD student in the US working at CERN on ATLAS hardware and software, and I found that I enjoyed what I did much more than the actual physics.  

I very much enjoyed my time as a PhD student and I got to work on some really cool projects, but I was getting to the point where I needed to do real physics, and I just wanted to do hardware and software.  Now I have a real job that I enjoy where I can hone my software skills.

One thing I learned is that writing terrible code isn't only done by physicists... 
No, I love physics and consider learning QFT to be one of my proudest accomplishments in life. It was utterly useless for my career and life, but completely worth it for self-value and satisfaction. 

Although, not completely useless as I'm now a software engineer and when people ask "what's your background" and I say "theoretical physicist" they tend to assume I'm a certified genius and ask questions later. So I am at a huge advantage compared to everybody else who studied a more common field. 

Also, you really learn how to learn. You realize that you can absolutely never rely on memorizing things. You have to build your understanding up from the ground. Most other academic disciplines get by by memorizing facts and regurgitating them. So I notice a lot of programmers simply like to remember how to call a framework and don't exactly understand what's going on. My obsession over the years of tearing down physical concepts and understanding every inch of the process has proved to be vital to my career. 
Do they have better solutions than using tape?

Edit: One way expanded graphite can be made by intercalation, i.e. putting it in (strong)acid, and having ions go in the lattice. Then you dry it and heat it quickly.(graphite [absorbs microwaves well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbT-pUsn5KU)) As i understand it the ions want out and tear the layers apart. Basically it is haphazzardly, multiple layers of graphene, and occasionally one layer. Afaik, not useful for "really want one layer".

So i wonder if other materials have that. But i kindah suspect you always need nasty strong stuff.(and in the heating that comes out too.)
Isn't this more chemistry than physics? I understand the band gap created from the distance of the homo and lumo of the materials is physical chemistry.

You can always apply to the Perimeter Scholars International, in Canada. It is a funded MSc. program in Waterloo Canada, and they do research in areas that might interest you. The selection is very competitive, but the application is free.
Has anyone read any "delightful" papers lately that they'd like to share? 

I enjoyed [this one](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/84/9/10.1119/1.4955151), free version [here](https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:957601/FULLTEXT01.pdf)
Any suggestions for atomic physics books?
I know this isn't exactly physics, but I'm having trouble getting through introductory quantum mechanics by rojansky because of my lack of differential equations knowledge. Any one recommend a good DE book?
Hands down the best lectures on general physics come from Dr. Walter Lewin. The lectures were previously available via MIT open courseware. I don't necessarily want to get into a discussion about Lewin as a person, but his lectures still stand as an amazingly intuitive presentation of physics concepts.

[They're available on youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCliSRiiRVQuDfgxI_QN_Fmw/playlists)

___

[The cliffnotes of Maxwell's equations.](https://www.amazon.com/Students-Guide-Maxwells-Equations/dp/0521701473/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1477686373&sr=8-1&keywords=a+student%27s+guide+to+maxwell%27s+equations)

For both general E&M (usually second semester of General Physics) and dedicated E&M 1 and 2 this is an excellent "pocket" reference. It breaks down each of Maxwell's equations as well as some of the related equations like the biot-savart law and Laplace's equation.

[The breakdown looks like this.](https://i.imgur.com/OFKO2Lb.jpg) Each of the arrows gets its own page describing what the operation or value MEANS. The whole book is about 100 pages, but it's pretty thorough... and really easy to read.

I will never not recommend this to people.

I'm almost done with my electrical engineering degree. I took a physics minor as well, so I got to see physics taught in a few different ways.  
**Here are some of the textbooks I used:**

[University Physics With Modern Physics](https://www.amazon.com/University-Physics-Modern-14th/dp/0321973615/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477687128&sr=1-2&keywords=university+physics+with+modern+physics) (used for general physics 1-3)

One of the best textbooks (maybe THE best) I've had the pleasure of using. It has very intuitive presentation of concepts and a really nice layout. It also has minimal fluff and a perfect explanation-to-equation/diagram ratio. It works so well with the Lewin lectures, that I'm wondering if this is the book MIT used.

Either way, it's a fucking amazing text. I bought the loose-leaf version for better portability and... obtained... the PDF. I don't feel bad at all about my purchase, even though I had access to the book anyway.
___
[Modern Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Physics-Kenneth-S-Krane/dp/1118061144/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477687571&sr=1-1&keywords=modern+physics) (used for modern physics 1 and 2)

This was another good book. I didn't think it was as intuitive as the general physics text, but most of the content is far less intuitive anyway. I have no major complaints about this text. The layout was also not QUITE as nice as the superb general physics text above.
___
[Introduction to Electromechanics](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Electrodynamics-4th-David-Griffiths/dp/8120347765/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477687811&sr=1-1&keywords=introduction+to+electrodynamics) (used for E&M 1 and 2)

Again, the layout isn't quite as nice as the General Physics book. The book seems solid, and my complaints are minor and rare enough that I don't remember most of them. The book starts with a vector calculus refresher, which is good because the notation isn't exactly the same as my Stewart text. Once again, no major complaints.
___
[Fundamentals of Applied Electromagnetics](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Applied-Electromagnetics-Fawwaz-Ulaby/dp/0133356817/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477688188&sr=1-1&keywords=fundamentals+of+applied+electromagnetics) (used for my EE electromagnetics course)

Remember when I said the general physics text had a good explanation-to-equation/diagram ratio? The idea for that ratio came from this book. It's seriously packed with equations and diagrams, without more than a small blurb between them. That makes the text dense as fuck. Not only that, but the book is in full color, and those colors are SERIOUSLY overused. Everything is highlighted or written in a different color. It makes the book HARDER to read, because it's confusing to the eye.

It's a good reference, because it's generally pretty concise, but it's a little annoying to use.
___
If anyone is interested, I can talk about my [Solid State](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Semiconductor-Devices-Donald-Neamen/dp/0072987561/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477688945&sr=1-1&keywords=an+introduction+to+semiconductor+devices), [Circuits](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Electric-Circuits-Charles-Alexander/dp/0073380571/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477689028&sr=1-1&keywords=fundamentals+of+electric+circuits), [Communications](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Communication-Electrical-Computer-Engineering/dp/0195331451/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477689099&sr=1-1&keywords=modern+digital+and+analog+communication+systems), [Signals&Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Signals-Systems-Transforms-Charles-Phillips/dp/0133506479/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477689145&sr=1-1&keywords=signals+systems+and+transforms), [Electromechanics](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Electric-Machines-Power-Electronics/dp/111807887X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477688992&sr=1-1&keywords=principles+of+electric+machines+and+power+electronics), etc textbooks. Those are EE rather than physics, though.
___
I never got a chance to use these, but some of the physics students wouldn't shut up about them:

[The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Feynman-Lectures-Physics-Set/dp/0201021153)

[A few of Feynman's lectures are also available online.](http://www.cornell.edu/video/playlist/richard-feynman-messenger-lectures)

I love Feynman's style of explanation, I really do. It flows from one thought to another in a very fluid and beautifully visual way. The reason I don't rate them higher than Lewin's lectures is because it's a bit harder to apply the explanations in a practical sense (as in how to approach a particular problem in the book).

Still worth a watch IMO, but if you need help with physics, Lewin is a more direct path (and has way more content available)
I'm doing an independent study next semester to finish my astronomy minor, and want to do a course on computational astrophysics.

I'm looking to do a project every week , and want an advanced undergrad textbook that can help me set up and understand projects to do.
Any good recommendations for books on special relativity? Currently a freshmen astro physics major looking for a good read to help me get a basis of ideas to come 
I'm looking for an advanced but intuitive treatment of quantum optics, if such a thing exists. Preferably with an emphasis on the underlying Hilbert algebra, as this is something I've never had a formal discussion of.
I'm in the US, I got a job as an aerospace engineer.
My supervisor was also a physics major and he got a job as an aerospace engineer too.
It will depend mostly where you intern and who you meet as an undergrad. Some companies are willing to train as long as you have experience in anything STEM related.
Make an effort to know more about the field you're interested in as well.
I really wanted to do aerospace so I learned 3D modeling and drafting skills on my own before the interviews.
Thats the kind of stuff that will make you attractive as a fresh graduate.
You don't need a PhD to get a job. But you need it if you want to do physics research (99% of the time).
Possibly it's because in the US, a physics graduate would have a bachelors, while in the UK, they would usually have an MPhys.

Alternatively, they may have been talking about a job *doing physics*, i.e. doing research, which you would need a graduate degree for.
I have a bachelor's degree in physics and had no trouble getting job interviews. I ended up an engineer, and one of the senior engineers also only has an undergrad in physics. 

It depends on the field you want to get into.

Silicon Valley seems to have lots of jobs for Physics grads, specifically in the semiconductor industry.
I believe this might aid your quest for knowledge!

This is just kind of bad, actually.

I don't know how an idiosyncratic alternative conceptual rationale (that I'm not actually convinced is even correct) for anyon exchange phases "demystifies" the concept - if anything it becomes much more mysterious: *if anyon statistics isn't a consequence of spatial dimension, but of an asymmetric potential that "distinguishes" otherwise indistinguishable particles, why aren't there anyons in 3 dimensions?*

Edit: to anyone hoping to have anyons actually demystified, Preskill's lecture notes give a very nice overview http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/topological.pdf
As I  understand it, this explanation isn't really right. If you look at Laughlin's wave function for example, exchanging the coordinates of two quasiparticles doesn't change the wave function; they look like bosons. The anyonic phase is the Berry phase you get from adiabatically braiding them around each other.  
If the number you want to show is "0" it'll be easy!
Sure! [Just follow this tutorial, putting the left half of the number on one side and the right half on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0SelyTKYUc)
Depends on the axis of rotation. The simplest case is if you rotate around the disc's normal vector through the center. Then you would only get circles, unless lights on the disc are turned on and off.
Draw has is limitations, what about making it like a punch card with multiple disks overlapping. With proper timing, stopped it would be paper wheels with random holes, spinning in the proper sync with a backlight I imagine you could accomplish more. It is breaking/bending the stipulations given though.
You mean something like this?  A string of leds is spun and some are turned on and off for different time periods to create the illusion of letters or patterns.

http://www.instructables.com/id/Spinning-LED-Display/
If you mean spinning like a disc in an optical drive would, you wouldn't achieve any number (that doesn't have angular symmetry). To get the effect I assume, you will need to have a video camera with a sample rate and fast shutter speed (as our eyes blur the image while the drawing is in motion, but a camera takes snapshots)
Who ends up using the results of this research? It seems like the people in industry would know way more about their own products than the researchers. 
I'm in the industry.  Long story short, there's a substantial oversupply of solar panels due to varying factors.  1) The extension of the US Solar ITC, which removed the urgency of projects being completed by the end of 2016.  2) China drastically reduced their domestic consumption initiatives in July of this year.  3) SunEdison, the largest solar developer in the world, filed for Chapter 11 in April of this year, pushing out or cancelling multiple projects.  This led to the oversupply, as panel manufacturers were gearing up to fulfill both Chinese and US projects by the end of 2016.  Chinese suppliers are now dumping panels into the US and elsewhere in order to clear their inventories and keep their lines running.  And traditionally in solar, pricing never fluctuates.  Once it drops, the tendency is for pricing to keep dropping.  I would not be surprised to seen more panel manufacturers to declare bankruptcy in the near future, as most are showing significant losses.    
Solar roadways could use this. 


TRIGGERED
Just use LTSpice, it's free, has a decent parts library, and you can actually simulate as well.
I would use a grease pencil or wet erase marker to draw on windows, be it circuits or anything else.
Can't recommend KiCAD enough for this stuff. I've used it since secondary school for drawing electrical schematics.
Depends on what sort of circuits you're interested in.

I use the eeschema schematic package from KiCAD for complex electronic schematics:
http://kicad-pcb.org/
It's open source and seems pretty good. It integrates with a circuit-board design package but I haven't tried that.
imho spice is ugly, I use Fritzing. It's kinda heavy, has a lot of features beyond just sketching circuit schematics, but it's pretty and more user friendly than most other stuff I've seen.
I use this website when I have to make circuit diagrams for quiz/exam problems: 
http://www.digikey.com/schemeit/

Try Circuitmaker http://circuitmaker.com/
[Cadsoft](https://cadsoft.io) has a free version of their Eagle cad. The free version is good for small projects. They limit the schematic sheets to two and the board layout to two layers. There's also an educational version that isn't limited.
A while back I did an experiment to see the glow of different materials as a plasma (see attached GIF).

As expected you get the positive glowing column consisting of glowing disks.

But when using water you don't get this disks, you get this weird fine mushroom like structure.

I'm curious, can someone explain what is going on and what causes this?

My best guess would be it has something to do with the more energy stats in water in contrast to e.g. argon and/or the high stability of the generated ions...

>I wonder how realistic is it to teach myself physics

Somewhat realistic

>...to the point that I can start to publish serious papers and to work with other physicists on cutting edge issues?

Very unrealistic.

>Have you seen anyone who taught themselves physics and eventually became a physicist?

No, although I know people who, with a background in physics, have  published smaller papers based on independent work.

>I only have a master degree in engineering, is there a way for me to apply for PhD in a university?

Yes, this is quite possible. What kind of engineering?
Not very realistic. In the end, doing research and publishing is a job that requires certain qualification and having a degree is your way to prove you have it.

Just consider if you were to ask this question about a different profession. Would you let a self-taught surgeon operate on you? Would you fly a plane made by a self-taught engineer?
I have a bachelor's in physics and have been working in the software field for about 2 years now. I started down this road about 1 year ago. The thing about QFT and GR is the amount of pre-requisite math required. I went through Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds in college as a part of a supplement for analysis (really any analysis covering euclidean differentiation and integration (stokes and divergence) should be fine.). When I started I started with tensor analysis and differential forms (this also covered calculus of variations) https://www.amazon.com/Tensors-Differential-Variational-Principles-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00A735HK8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1477673224&sr=8-1&keywords=tensors+variational. Then to really understand QFT you need to go through Mechanics at a graduate level which means Goldstein's Classical Mechanics and Zangwill's Electrodynamics. I'm assuming you have gone through Griffith's Electrodynamics. I'm still working on this. Probably going to start QFT after this. If you have engineering QM you'll have to go through Shankar there is no way around it. All of the books mentioned are built for self-study.  It's very realistic to teach yourself the physics, but then working in the field and publishing papers require communal and tribal knowledge which can only be gained through peers and reading papers. So I'm not sure this is realistic to do working a 40 hour a week job also not sure it's worth it to go deeper than this.
This is really useful! Thanks!
If YouTube is to be believed, you don't even have to study.. just string a bunch of sciencey words together and spout off your theories in a confident tone. (Sorry, but it has to be said - there are so many crackpots out there!)
> for the first time

Yeah, not so much.
**between single atoms**

Van der Waals forces in general are trivial to measure.
Holy shit that is amazing. I'm surprised the LJ curves match so well. Sure, they're different but given the noise of the data and the other approximations made in MD it seems that the functional form of the pair potential is one of the smallest factors of simulation-reality mismatch. That makes me pretty happy. 

If they got data for Ar-Ar or Kr-Kr they could investigate the validity of all the various mixing rules used in simulation, which would be super interesting (to me).
I can't speak for everyone but in my senior year of my undergrad. Most of our seniors are going for engineering. Out of our 13 seniors, one is going to grad school for physics. For the most part, it seems as though a grad degree is needed for a Physics career. 

The workload is probably more than other majors, at least from what I've seen. There are a lot of required classes to take, from all of the math, chem, and then physics. My average amount of credits per semeater has been 16+ and that seems to be the norm. It's definitely doable though.
I'm a 3rd year major in astrophysics and applied math, with a comp sci minor My roommate is a mechanical engineering major. 

1) I'm not sure about jobs, yet, but with experience with math and/or computer science along with the physics makes it MUCH easier to find available internships, research, etc. during the undergrad. My roommate has had very nice internships as well and the demand for engineering is high. The upside to engineering is that you get experience in all three fields (math, comp. sci, physics) without having to have multiple majors. For physics, you take a lot of math classes, but you may not have as much experience in comp sci if you don't learn on your own or do research. (Note: all research you will do involves programming. I can almost guarantee it.) 

Either way, the skills you develop should be applicable to finding a job. Don't take this as fact, but I would imagine that engineering is a little more marketable since it is a very practical skill compared to physics, which is more theoretical. 

2) It's a lot of work for both of them (again, I'm speaking for undergrad, although I can't imagine grad school will be any less work haha). I asked my roommate and he said that a lot of the classes he takes don't really seem like work, but more like a really engaging set of problems you have to work on. I agree completely with physics. 

Compared to other majors, though, it's difficult for me to say. I can say for sure that physics and math are some of the hardest around just because they are "hard sciences." I have friends who have a lot of work as English majors, as well, though. While the content of the physics major is most likely more difficult by nature, it's hard to say the work load is larger. It depends on what kind of person you are, I imagine.


Sorry for the wall of text, but I hope it helps out some. If you like physics, both majors are going to be engaging for you. If you prefer a more practical physics, building cool things, inventing engineering may be a better choice. For example, my roommate and I are building a radio telescope for a project. He is designing the whole thing, but I am helping out with some of the calibrations, math, and programming. If you want to something like that, physics or astrophysics may be more your style.  Good luck, and I hope you enjoy whatever you choose. 
Just remember, to make anything of that degree you must set your sights on a PhD. Which, these days, will pay off handsomely. 

Also, along the way you can bail out into engineering if it's not a good fit.

Just make sure you love all forms of math, because learning Physics is as much about the math as it is about the physical processes. 

I'd say the workloads are comparable to engineering, math, or computer science majors. 

Physics undergrad degree only here... **Don't do it.** Huge effort not worth return. I can't find a job to save my life. Everyone's impressed but you're overqualified for "lesser" jobs and under qualified for regular jobs from lack of related work experience, so you can't get experience needed. Go engineering seriously. 
Current undergrad in physics (astrophysics) in Australia. Any research jobs in physics would definitely require a PhD, and from what I have heard those positions tend to be few and far between, so are highly competitive. I have also heard that jobs that do not require a PhD, but instead only require a Masters, are even more competitive due to the large numbers of people applying. 

Physics (+ other 'hard' sciences) definitely has a higher constant workload than most other majors. Other majors do a few essays throughout the semester, maybe a few other key pieces here and there. Physics has weekly assignments, and labs on top of that, so we're never without work to do and we can't just leave it for 3 weeks until the night before. If you miss a few days, it can be extremely difficult to catch back up. 
1. Difficulty varies based on your school and the employers present in the local economy.  Put some serious effort starting now into learning how to program -- either on your own or through a CS minor/double major -- and you'll be fine.  It's well worth it for how much easier it will make physics research, should you go that direction.

2. Extremely much more, but I guarantee dumber people than you have managed it, so if it's what you want to do, go for it!
can you give us a location? us,europe,australia? because the asnwer might vary quite a bit depending on where you live.
Hi, I majored in Engineering Physics because I struggled with this exact same decision. I very much enjoyed both sets of classes, though I felt more like a physics major all the time (my degree was through the physics department, and other physics majors were the people I spent time with). Now I work as an engineer in the aerospace industry (have been here for a bit over 3.5 years), and I feel my combined background gave me a unique and strong starting point for entering my field.

1) I didn't spend much time looking for physics jobs, but I felt that grad school would have been necessary to advance in the field. It's hard to say what the market will look like when you graduate, but having a science/engineering background will certainly give you a good starting point. One thing I'm sure you'll hear later on is that a strong differentiator between candidates when looking forn your first job is your work experience. Try to work with professors, or go for internships to get your foot in the door.

2) The workload for science and engineering will be higher than many other majors. Google "quality of life engineering vs liberal arts" for a quick chuckle. Joking aside, if these are the fields you want to work in, you'll need to get accustomed to working hard and thinking hard. I don't think workload between physics and engineering was much different, but my physics classes certainly demanded a stronger mastery of math/calculus.

Cheers, and please let me know if you have any other questions.
I went to a school without an engineering program. We did have a dual degree program with another school that was on my radar. Also I went to a liberal arts college, so a state school may be a different beast, I don't know.
1) Job prospects are great with a physics degree if you have some Computer Science under your belt. It also depends on what you want to do. Do you want to do engineering? Get an engineering degree. Contrary to popular belief, the coursework is very, very different. Engineering degrees at most schools are highly regimented with required courses in all sorts of things that physics majors take as electives if they want to. It took ~12 courses to get the basic version of the physics major at my school, engineering school can be double that or more. (Keep in mind on a semester system, you only take 32 courses over 4 years) Do you want to take philosophy and sculpture and ancient history? Get a physics major, or go somewhere like Trinity or Dartmouth where the engineering degree leaves some freedom to do that.

2) Workload: if you are clever about course order it's not too bad,  start freshman year and take math concurrently with the intro semesters of physics. For us , the sophomore year of physics (20th century stuff) was hell but the electives we took junior and senior year were all pretty straightforward, except for one I took on advanced quantum mechanics senior fall as part of an extension to my major that I did, that was also hell. (Taught by a man who said there was no crying in physics every time someone complained, and in another course yelled at me for smiling in class) Hell courses were ~8-10 hours of work per week. Straightforward ones were 4-6.

P.S. If you are interested in engineering, check our Kettering and their co-op program, i wish I had known about it when I was applying to colleges 
The workload of a physics major and most engineering majors will be fairly comparable.  Both are at the high end of what you expect to find among all majors.

A physics degree has two uses:  You can combine it with an education certification to teach high-school physics, or you can use it to get into a graduate program.  An engineering degree has one use: you can get a job as an engineer.

One option that doesn't get mentioned often is that if you are planning on grad school anyway, an undergraduate physics degree can let you move to a graduate engineering program.  The physics degree will give you a greater breadth of knowledge if you are not yet sure what kind of engineering you would want to study.
Get a job with a physics bachelors isn't hard. Getting a job doing physics is impossible without a phd. My classmates from undergrad that didn't go to grad school have good paying jobs compared to their peers doing programming, engineering, or financial type things, and physics majors tend to have really high scores on the LSAT.

Undergrad work load is tough but not that much more than other majors. I did a double major with math and actively took as many classes as possible so I ended up doing more than I had to. You absolutely MUST be good at mathematics (specifically calculus and linear algebra and maybe a little group theory) and abstract thought to do physics whereas from what I understand for engineering it helps to be good at math but I know engineers who failed calculus twice but still managed to get the degree. Engineering is also a work intensive degree, but I think it has more design of real things rather than focusing on physical concepts, so engineers don't really need to know the physical laws beyond how to use them to design things.

In graduate school for physics the work load is very hard. A grad level class can easily have the work load of three undergraduate classes and I had no free time at all for my first two years. It wasn't uncommon for me to work well over 60 hours per week teaching, taking classes and doing research. I am on to full time research so I still work a lot but there are less absurd work weeks and occasionally I can actually have free time on the weekend. The only reason you should do a physics phd is if you really want to do physics because even though you get a good salary and benefits once you finally get a full time job either in industry or academia, grad school is very hard and takes a lot of personal sacrifice over the course of 6 or so years and it can turn a lot of idealists into cynics.
*Speaking as a current physics major (3rd Year):*  
At my university I think the workload seems ~on par with engineering.  

**General Description**  

Physics is more focused on the theoretical. Certainly geared towards grad school. On the other hand, engineering will give you a more hands on approach. My engineering friends are always build something and doing projects. If hands on is your thing, engineering is your game. Skills are also a bit more specific than physics. This can be better for entering the work force because you know exactly how to do what your employer will want.

**The Last Word**  

Talk to your advisor, they will let you know how you can set up your courses so that you could take either major a year or so down the road. Most people don't know what they want when they first get to college. You'll have to take some physics for engineering anyways, so its feasible to swap. If you find yourself drawn in, and wanting to know *why* or *how* more for the sake of just knowing rather than for the ability to apply it, then maybe you should go into physics. Really its about what makes you feel fulfilled at the end of the day. 

Current engineering undergrad with a love of physics. You could always do what I mean doing, minor in it and pursue it later. Engineering will open up more career opportunities but the minor (or double major if you're crazy) will allow you to keep options open
Undergrad degree in physics and geography here. I will say that your workload will be WAY higher than any other major. I spent about 3 times longer working on physics than i did on my geography major. One thing that people forget about when talking about jobs is that you dont have to get a 'physicist' job after college. Most S&T type jobs will have a specific major that is applicable and then say 'or physics.' Take a chemist for example, you learn so much in physics about atomic, molecular, and chemical interactions that you still are qualified for the job. Same is true for graduate degrees. Most engineering graduate programs will accept physics undergraduate degrees with maybe the need for one or two additional foundational classes. 

While I can only speak for myself, whenever people find out that i have a physics degree they always have the same reaction. "Wow that sounds intense" or "Wow you must be smart." My degree in physics has opened so many doors for me and has allowed me to have many different career options. 
I personally went with my guts and took Physics/Math over engineering. 
I might be late to the discussion, but I'd like to put my two cents in.

Don't declare a major until you have to. Worst case scenario is you find out you don't love physics or engineering, then you can just switch to something else. It's not like you'll be locked into your major once you declare it, but just take gen eds for your first 2 or 3 semesters and fit in as many physics or engineering classes as you can. 

I will say that I've found physics students can easily adapt to engineering, but the converse may not be true. Honestly, whether or not you'll get a job depends more on your connections. As long as you network and make friends, you should be fine (unless you want to be the next superstar, but that's a different matter).
I don't have much time to respond to this but I'm currently an undergrad 3-2 major. So I go to a school for 3 years to get a physics degree and then I go to another school for 2 years to get an engineering degree. Both or bachelors but I think it's something you should check out. 
Undergrad here. 3rd year in Nuclear Engineering BS minor in Math, planning on graduate study in Medical Physics (Ms or PhD). I think my situation is kind of different, as i am in an engineering major that relies very heavily on physics and math, much more so than other majors at my school (mechanical, industrial, civil etc..). I am much more interested in physics and math than the engineering, which mostly consists of design. If you are unsure and have a desire in physics, looking into an engineering program that relies heavily on physics! My school offers nuclear and engineering physics. Personally, i feel as someone with a BS engineering degree will be recruited more than someone with a BS in physics. I feel like degrees in academic-heavy fields like physics are best at the graduate level and if you have an interest in doing research.
People in this comment section have NO clue what they are talking about.  Don't listen to these people, LOOK up jobs. Google physics jobs and see what comes up. I guarantee you will see a lot of Health physics jobs, dosimetry, RSO, engineering and advising jobs. You know how I know? I JUST looked. 

You can't get a job with a B.Sc in physics? WHAT!!? Your entire degree is based in learning how things move and interact with each other, you are heavily padded in math and you know mechanics. If you can't find a job from this training, it is YOU, not your education. 

You do NOT need graduate studies, this is such hog wash. Listen, if you want to RESEARCH anything you will need a PhD. This is not new. You can perhaps get a tech position or a helping position without a PhD but why would you not get a PhD IF research is what you want to do?

Let me give you a tip. Your degree doesn't give you a paycheck. Your VALUE gives you the paycheck. So no matter what field you want to work in: Engineering, computer science, health physics, chemistry, finances etc.. It is up to YOU to make yourself employable. And on this topic: Analytical chemistry in the government ..love physics. Actually most positions in the government love physics degrees because of the broad applications. 

You know what else? Teaching, there is a HUGE shortage of math and physics teachers. Honestly, not my first choice but if you love teaching..there you go. 

Also, let's get real for a second. A physics major opens a door to view the universe. It gives you a glimpse into how things work. It builds the list of questions that you can answer and understand. This is an INCREDIBLE undergraduate degree. Anybody who argues with this, has no right being in the sciences or is clearly ignorant to what a PHYSICS degree is, I.e. fundamental laws of the universe. 

So NO. All of you Comp Sci or Eng or nothing people. Stick it up your rear. The jobs for physics are countless (including comp and eng), you just need to see where you fit it. If you expect a degree to open every door..that's your issue. No degree does that. A physics degree is an incredible arsenal to have on your tool belt and is a FANTASTIC degree for job employability and mental growth. 
I've been following this channel for a while. Simply love it. 
There is a colloquium talk at MIT on December 8th on the many worlds interpretation. Sean Carroll is giving it so it should be good. 
Sounds like you're describing [Second Harmonic Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-harmonic_generation).
Yes, just by virtue of T symmetry acting on stimulated emission.
In addition to the already mention Second Harmonic Generation, there  is also the [Photon Upconversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_upconversion) process, in which a target is brought into an excited state that has some life-time and within that life-time it adsorbs a second photon, and the [two-photon adsorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_absorption) process in which a single target adsorbs two photons simultaneously. Both processes are exploited in an experimenal technique known as [Two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_photoelectron_spectroscopy)
Do you know about Sisyphus cooling (or laser cooling in general)?
To be clear, what you are describing wouldn't be called stimulated absorption. Stimulated absorption and plain old absorption refer to the same thing, since you need the photon to stimulate the transition. This nomenclature makes sense because the Einstein coefficients for absorption and stimulated emission are equal to each other (when the two states have the same degeneracy).
Two photon excitation is used all the time in organics so that the excitation photons are only half the energy of the fluorescing photons. No one calls it stimulated absorption though. 

There is also excited state absorptions, where you populate some state by means of photoexcitation, then another photon can bring the particle (electron, hole, exciton, whatever) to another excited state starting from that first excited state. Again, no one calls this a stimulated absorption.  
Absorption is stimulated absorption, but [2-photon gain](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05912) is probably what you're looking for. 
Not sure I understand the question. Check out non-linear optics for examples of multi-photon processes. These require the high flux and coherence available in lasers.
[sic] the title, which is kind of clickbaity but not enough for /r/savedyouaclick, but it needs some exposition.

The 3D printer spits out unmagnetized paramagnetic dust suspended in a 10% plastic hot-glue matrix to make shapes that would be expensive or impossible to mold normally. But that's just 3D-printing shapes, which isn't all that new.

Then the object is magnetized after it's molded. The article is unclear on the magnetization process, in particular whether it can vary the magnetic field strength over the surface of the object, or is constant and the shape of the object forms all of the spatial variation in the magnetic field.

It's not like they're laying down magnetic domains in the final pattern with the printer to make complex internal magntization patterns.

They also don't say anything about maybe using materials with different permeabilities. I'll happily take those royalties if they haven't thought of it yet.

While checking to see if this was posted I found postings about complex magnets here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3djwe3/printedprogrammable_magnets_multipole_for_complex/
Smarter Every Day did a video on polymagnets. There was one that acted like a lock and key. Completely amazing stuff. I'm pretty sure the guy is a redditor. If you see this, never stop making videos!
I have a bachelor's in CS and am considering exploring physics for academia. Would I need to get a different bachelors in physics if I eventually wanted to be a professor/researcher or would I be able to get a masters? Does anyone have advice for exploring physics more before making a decision? Books, articles, etc?

Also, I read that many phDs are kicked out of researching after getting their phD.  How common is that really?
I often see people here say something about how the employability of Physics majors isnt bad. That people want to hire them because they have the maths, technical skills, and are problem solvers.

This is true and all but like surely as an employer you would also want people that actually trained for the job that youre hiring for. And while its true that maybe the only people that has more maths than Physics majors are Maths people, the maths as applied in physics are, well, applied in physics.

So I guess what I'm asking is: what jobs specifically (NOT academia) do people mean when they talk about employing Physics majors. Do you need to minor in something, take extra classes as undergrad? What are the statistics (ofc approximately) because yea definitely theyre everywhere but like 1 finance guy in 30 is hardly common? What does working outside physics entail, like what do you need?

Sorry. The questions are everywhere but basically I'm just trying to get a hold of what the job market is like.
I am applying to math graduate schools but I am interested in mathematical physics, especially stuff that intersects algebraic geometry. 

What are the best schools for this kind of stuff in the US? 
I am currently in the process of applying to grad school. In most of the programs that I am considering, there is one or two people in particular with whom I think I would like to work. 

1. Is it considered normal behavior for me to email these people, even though I dont know them? I want to know if working with them would be an option. To get there and find out that they arent really looking to take on students would be really disappointing.

2. A big concern of mine is that although these people work on the problems I am interested in, they might not be the best people to actually work with. How can I best get a feel for this via an email interaction?

3. How much is it ok for me to ask these people random questions about the grad program? (By random questions I mean, how does funding work by you? How set in stone is the curriculum? etc.)

4. What should I find out from someone if I am considering working with them? (I am hoping that the collective wisdom and experience of r/physics might have some advice along the lines of if I knew then what I know now I wouldve asked xyz...)

TIA
I'm a senior astro major with a minor in CS, going to do poorly on the PGRE, going to do well on the regular one, and then apply to a million things (schools,jobs,etc.). I don't really have a question, I'm just freaking out. Any advice to dealing with the fact that the future is incredibly uncertain?
A lot of people have been commenting lately on the lack of employment for PhDs. Are there any fields of physics that are more employable than others?
So I'm finishing up my undergraduate in degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. I've run across some universities with CS Master/PhD programs aimed at theoretical computer science which is honestly about the only thing which interests me in CS. 

Although this may be a pipe dream, but the most interesting of all is quantum computing. I'm just wondering if that is a big hill to climb for someone without a background in classical physics.  

Its worth noting, I've hopped around a number of fields during my undergraduate time, particularly algorithmics,AI, computational science, analysis, number theory, dynamical systems.

If I could jump ship and do it again,  I think I'd have gone physics and studied orbital mechanics or something.
I'm planning on applying to graduate school this fall and was wondering if anyone could recommend groups in the US working in nonlinear dynamics/complex systems? I am only familiar with individuals associated with the Sante Fe Institute and NECSI.

I'm also retaking the PGRE and was wondering how much I should bother applying to top ranked programs if I score poorly again. I scored ~51% percentile last Oct and after studying have a feeling I can get at most 60-70%. 

You want to use the hamiltonian in the rotating frame to find the wavefunction, and then transform back into the lab frame.

The whole point is that the rotating frame has a different hamiltonian than the lab frame, so the specifc functional forms of the eigenfunctions will be different.
So in other words, the purpose of life is to hasten the process that will lead to the eventual heat death of the universe? Not a very satisfying answer, but I guess it wraps things up neat and tidy. 
The British physicist/theologian John Polkinghorne likes to pose the question, "*Why is the tea kettle boiling?*"  As is the case with many "why" questions, there are multiple levels of explanation.  Level #1 is that the water has warmed to the boiling point as a result of an increase in entropy associated with combustion.  Level #2 is that the stove and tea kettle were engineered in such a way as to make this boiling occur.  The ultimate level of explanation for "why" the kettle is boiling arises from the fact that Mrs. Polkinghorne wants a cup of tea.

You can add more levels of causation for the boiling kettle, and even some above that last level.  But a layman who asks about the meaning of life usually is asking about the highest level of causation, and he or she might be confused by a video like this one with its explanation of low-level mechanisms.  The unspoken implication by Sean Carroll is that there *is* no existential meaning of life, or that such a concept is meaningless to begin with.
You pass butter.
This might be the perfect thread for this:
[What is life-lecture: Jeremy England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91D5UAz-f4).

I highly recommend watching it.
I freaking loved this "Big Picture" series. The question of "if the universe tends towards high entropy/low energy states, why does something so complex such as life even exist?" is one that has plagued me for a long time. I love that they explored the distinction between the realms of entropy vs complexity and complexity vs energy. 
It seems they are trying to solve a philosophical question with pure scientific reason... I'm sure anyone can see the flaw in that. In fact, the question itself is too ambiguous and broad. I think the question we mean to ask here is 'what is the purpose of conciousness being associated with our specific body's?' but mb that's just me lol
A hammer has a purpose if a human uses it. The hammer doesn't have a purpose if there isn't a human.

Saying "life's purpose is to increase entropy" only makes sense if we assume there's a god-like being who either created or is actively using life to speed up the heat death of the universe.
I'm not sure the science checks out. If sunlight shines on a barren rock, it heats the rock up, the rock radiates IR light, and entropy is increased immediately. If sunlight shines on a tree, the tree stores some of that light's energy in chemical bonds, which last for years before eventually getting broken down and converted into waste heat (as the tree dies and decomposes). It’s the difference between using a megajoule of energy to power a heater vs. using the energy to charge a battery, waiting an hour, then using the battery to power the heater. At the end of the day, all the energy gets converted to the same amount of heat. If you’re doing this with a lot of batteries, the average rate of energy-to-heat conversion is roughly constant, no matter how many batteries you have, but whenever you add a bunch of new batteries to the system, it temporarily slows down the energy-to-heat conversion (since you have more batteries charging than discharging), and when you remove a bunch of batteries, you temporarily increase the energy-to-heat conversion (since you have more batteries discharging than charging). Right now, humans are discharging and removing a lot of old batteries (fossil fuels, coal, nuclear power, etc.), but we also have the potential to colonize the galaxy and put new and better batteries on barren planets. It remains to be seen whether we’ll have built up a stockpile of batteries by the time the universe would otherwise have hit heat death, or if we’ll bring about heat death sooner by finding and discharging nature’s batteries faster than they would normally discharge themselves.
Whatever the purpose is, clearly it is unimportant because the universe functions pretty well without it.

Unless, of course, life's purpose was to evolve to a point where we can prevent the heat death of the universe...then life becomes a survival mechanism for the universe itself. 
I still struggle with labelling higher/lower entropy states, it just feels so counter-intuitive 

Coffee and milk in 2 seperate glasses - high entropy/disorder
Coffee and milk mixed together - low entropy/disorder
Wtf is that even right
I heard an answer one time about what the purpose of life is. 

They told me that the purpose of life is to successfully reproduce. 

Not to reproduce, but to do it successfully. 

For some organisms that's a simple process.

But for humans...

That means you have to have and teach your offspring emotional stability, to learn and teach your offspring proper social skills, etc... to be serene and to produce and teach others how to be serene. 

It was a rather interesting, all inclusive, laws of nature obeying answer that has left me rather satisfied. 

**TL;DR:** Become a healthy individual and produce healthy offspring. Emotionally healthy, socially healthy, physically healthy, etc...

I think im getting it, in my own words its not about the state of a system at any given time but more about the potential possibilities ....hmmm that might sound funny but im definitely starting to get my head around it cheers
Excellent way of looking at it.
So hydrogenating carbon dioxide to create methane is the purpose of life? Guess Kurt was right...

"I tell you, we are here on Earth to fart around, and don't let anybody tell you different." - Kurt Vonnegut


Anyone interested in cellular organization may be interested in a recent talk by Dr. Michael Rosen.  By applying principles of polymer chemistry and phase transitions to biology, his lab has made tremendous progress in improving our understanding of cellular organization at the micron-scale length.

Purpose means a conscious intention.

I really hate to see it used to refer to inanimate objects which jave neither consciousness not intention.

I'm not just being pedantic.

It leads idiots like Schopenhauer to claim that the inanimate universe has 'Will', and many other idiots to claim that if the Universe has a purpose, it must have been put there by a deity.

An apple doesn't fall because it 'wants' to, or because that's its 'purpose'.

That kind of talk just encourages Spiritualists and New Age kooks.
Just gotta love hearing Sean Carroll in those videos =)
I wish i could get back to just living, and not thinking about the meaning of life, death and what comes after. I just find it so hard to accept that i and everyone i know and ever knew will die and there is nothing i can do about it.
Fuck.
That brings back memories.  I loved watching this series when I was in grade school.
Optics.  Just didn't make sense on first pass.  Really had to work hard to understand it.  
Electromagnetism. I've never wiped on an exam as hard as I did in that one at university. Maxwell's equations - ugh. Never been a fan of that topic. My friends on the course thought it was hilarious, so I got the last laugh the following year when solid state physics and Bose-Einstein condensates were an open book to me but they struggled :)
I have exactly the same problem as you but with special relativity. I just could not do it. Everything I have done before and since have been easy: Quantum and Classical Mechanics, Termostatistics (struggled a bit at the start but overcome it), and solid state. But special relativity? My mind goes full dumb.
There was a class advanced mechanics. Just that, mechanics from like Newtown to Einstein just solving problems. 

I failed the first half of that course. It just did not click. I felt like a moron every time the prof was like "oh well see here the string length allows you to formulate pully Xs motion in terms of Ys" or whatever. 

Fuck that course, fuck Einstein, fuck Lagrange, fuck Hamiltonian whoever noether is chill she can stay but fuck the rest. 
I'm ashamed to admit, but Newtonian mechanics - I thought I knew them perfectly when in reality i was obsessed with quantum mechanics before even fully grasping  basics when I was in first year physics. I guess, a common mistake to look further into the horizon before identifying near objects. 
At the moment I'm having real trouble with both wave physics and quantum physics. I think my problem is that I've got all these wave equations floating about but i don't know what they mean and I can't visualise them 
Statistical mechanics.  Visualizing it wasn't so bad, but the math was horrendous.  I liked calculus where functions were smooth and you could integrate.  I was not a fan of very large but finite sums and factorials popping up everywhere.  Also it was very hard to check your work since more than a handful of particles and it was producing numbers too large for the calculator to handle.

Thermodynamics is much nicer.
In general solving problems (or at first working through worked examples trying to meticulously understand every single step) is the best approach to understanding concepts and theories you're struggling with. At the moment I'm struggling with second quantisation, so doing lots of problems on it!

edit: The Schrodinger equation I found a real pain, especially because it crops up in so many different forms and notations. But the best way to get to grips with it is using it.
Crystallography. I still do not understand it.
I struggled really hard with my first upper level E&M class, partly because I didn't quite have the math background for it yet (didn't have Fourier Analysis and didn't quite understand how to use delta functions at the time) and partly because I had a really bad professor (over half the class had to drop it and take it again the next semester with a different professor).

When I took E&M again the following semester with a better professor AND more math under my belt (specifically Fourier Analysis) I was able to pass the class.  I seem to have trouble learning math from a physics class, I need to learn the concepts in a math class first before I start using them in physics.
In HS things got hard for me at the photoelectric effect.
Newton's laws back in HS. I didn't understood why someone would study why something moves when you have kinematics. 
!remindme 3 weeks
In Graduate school, I'm taking Electrodynamics and Quantum.  I find working through problems in E&M to be harder, but I find that I hardly ever understand the reasoning of the methods in quantum.  
Definitely fluid Mechanics. 
Coupling higher order angular momentum. Holy crap is that some dry stuff with awful and inconsistent notation. What got me to overcome it  is basically being forced to do so in order to complete a project.
Maybe the Hamilton Jacobi equation.But after using it to solve some celestial mechanics, everything becomes clear 
Interference and waves in general. Visualizing it and seeing how things are linked together on videos and pictures really helped me.
I don't have a complete answer but I think what you need to do is to stop thinking of your issues as excuses. Those are the most valid reasons I've ever heard for not being passionate about something; the fact that you had such a rough life and are still here trying to get back into physics is amazing in itself.

Have you considered/done therapy? This seems like a clear course to me, given all the issues you're experiencing. I don't think people on the internet are going to be able to help you much more; it seems pretty obvious to me that physics has very little to do with what you're going through.

In the meantime, you might want to watch Youtube videos. Feynman is always a good one: maybe start with [Fun to Imagine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zZbX_9ru9U), and move on to [The Character of Physical Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzWzLyGuPRY&list=PL7BF07F016E2BF97E). There are also a bunch of popular physics channels like Sixty Symbols and Minute Physics.
Its quite hard to get back to having that child like mentality. Really hard to give advice about such a complicated thing without being you. Id suggest you stick by It stubbornly. Its really worth it. And hopefully eventually you'll find what you used to feel. 
One way to help re-inspire your passion might be to immerse yourself in videos/readings of physicists talking about their passions about their work. I wouldn't suggest starting with academic materials for this. I'd suggest starting with  fascinating and inspirational TED talk videos. There are currently 71 TED talks on physics, where physicists get 15 minutes or so to describe their work.  It's a great venue for kindling interests in physics.

The physics TED talks can be found here: https://www.ted.com/topics/physics

I have been through something very similar. I agree with everything Gwinbar, Lucretius0, and JRDMB have said. Especially with being stubborn. You need to be patient and persistent. Do whatever you like and you will make it, either if it is watching youtube documentaries about interesting physics topics, or about physicists that inspire you, you can read their biographies in wikipedia too, you can watch youtube videos of lectures for example the Susskind lectures are very good (there is even a classical mechanics lecture by Susskind).
Also you can read literature books about physics, such as A Brief History of Time, Feynman is very good as suggested by Gwinbar, I would definitely suggest that you read Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman, Six easy pieces, and Six not so easy pieces. Also look for cosmology books and generally physics books that are well rated in amazon and goodreads.
You can take a look at your old physics books, or find good general -lower level- physics books, to download or buy from the internet and start working on some stuff little by little every day. 
Good luck.
Asking "how do I restore my passion for physics?" means that the passion is still there, perhaps hidden, but quietly burning in the ashes and waiting to burn free.

Think of physics as what can make you free and happy.

At 27 perhaps you are too old to go back to college (but perhaps not). But there are plenty of things to do as a citizen scientist. Why don't you try science writing? In a few years you could build a good career (and a good life) as a freelance science writer specialized in physics.
Read science books, there's plenty out there that typically aim to inspire you. 

What I find keeps me motivated is putting physics to use. For example, while I'm learning about Solid State physics, I looked at the applications - I put solar cells together, worked with LEDs, transistors, diodes. This way the physics becomes more relevant to my life, I look at Solar Cells and know that the back side is p-type, front: n-type, I have an understanding of why it works; promotion of electrons to the conduction band, electrons and holes, forward bias, electron drift and diffusion. There may be other ways to do physics, but I think it is most pleasurable when you play with it. I guess if you're less of an engineering-type person, you can still play with theoretical models.
These two videos ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo)) did it for me.
I also used to be really depressed and also lost my passion for science. I think a good thing to start is to find some area you enjoy and read something about it, what restored my love for physics was quantum mechanics. I enjoyed that David Albert's Quantum Mechanics and Experience, might be too superficial for your current knowledge but share with your friends that might be interested! Lonely science is kinda boring, try to make some friends with the same interests as you. It's fun to listen what other people think, specially if they don't think like you, cause you might see things with other eyes and that's always good. Now, dunno how things work where you live but on my country, public colleges are open, you can just go to some physics department and talk to people, even watch some classes. Some might be jerks or something but don't let that turn you down, because most physicists love to talk about physics! See if there's any event you can participate or something like that near your area. I think science fairs in schools near you might be cool too, watching experiments is a neat thing, that's why I used to like science when I was a child. Science is magic! :D
Loss of motivation and loss of having joy in things seem to be typical symptoms of depression. Next to the other great suggestions in this thread I'd suggest you seek help for that. 

If you want to restore your passion for physics I would first try to restore your mental health. Depression is a serious problem.

I think you'd get free unlimited energy if you just kept using the "normal" Maxwell's equations, but if magnetic monopoles exist you have to change them into a [more symmetric form](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Maxwell.27s_equations) (so you no longer have DivB=0 etc.)
No, he's completely wrong.
> Is there any theoretical framework where magnetic monopoles could cause a violation of energy conservation?

No, it's utterly ridiculous. You're intuition is completely correct. I checked the Wiki source DragonTamerMCT linked, and it says nothing of the kind, either. I guess he just hasn't a clue what he's talking about.
this is like modern-day alchemy. you can't turn piss into gold, just as you can't generate energy from nothing. 
the answer is no, because magnetic monopoles don't exist. 
Where do you find these cool problems? Or how do you come up with them?
In #1, is z a Cartesian coordinate?
I'm going to try Jacobi's Dream later this week just because of the name. It would be easier for a spherical box though, but that would be another dream I suppose.
I remember trying to tackle (5) in 2D in my final year of high school. The question we tried to answer was something along the lines of 'if you threw an object of an infinite cliff horizontally, would the horizontal velocity reach zero in some finite time or not? We failed to solve it exactly but it was pretty fun. I later found out the equation has no analytic solution in the way we wanted to find it in 2D.
(2 and 4 were old ones from the problems of the week; only 2 had been solved.)
Is #3 not just zero?
Why is the drag problem so hard? You just have to do

[;m\frac{dv}{dt} = -mg - \vec{v}.\vec{v} \lambda ;]

and integrate. The velocity integral will have a solution in terms of inverse tangents. Or am I missing something?
I think I solved problem 3. One can decompose the initial wavefunction δ(x) as  the sum of 2cos(nπx) over all odd n. These functions happen to be energy eigenstates with eigenvalue π^(2)n^(2)/2, so the wavefunction at time t turns out to be the sum of 2cos(nπx)e^(-iπ^2 n^2 t/2) over odd n, which gives the difference of two Jacobi theta functions 2(θ(x/2; -πt/2) - θ(x; -2πt)). The probability density at the center of the box is then the squared modulus of this function evaluated at x=0. Is this right?

EDIT: wait, no, that's not right, δ(x) is not normalized. I guess I should work with a nascent delta approximation.
Usually, for university in Canada, most, if not all students will already have a professor who has accepted to supervise their thesis when application are made.

Basically. 
1. In the autumn semester of the last undergrad year, students will approach professor to know if they have positions available, if they have funding, and they will do application for grants. By the end of the semester, most of them will have an agreement with a professor, and have a roughly estimate of what the research will be about.
2. In the winter semester, that's when the application process happen.
3. Some students will start working with the professor during the summer, and have defined the research project by the first semester of grad studies.

Obviously, you can still apply without having an arrangement with a professor. However, if a professor is backing you, it helps your application process. 
Also, the system would work as if at the start, the order of planets in a straight horizontal line would be : Earth, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

The Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Ontario has a very strong condensed matter theory group.
SFU has a couple groups in condensed matter. I'm not sure of how much on the theoretical side they are though, but it could be worth checking out. Here's a list of all the faculty members and they're research topics if you interested at all https://www.sfu.ca/physics/people/faculty.html

McGill's condensed matter group is actually their best physics group. I believe they even work closely with industry. 
I did my PhD at McGill; they have a strong condensed matter theory group (profs Coish, Clerk, Guo, Pereg-Barnea, Grant, Provatas and maybe some that I missed). All the "top schools" in Canada have strong condensed matter physics though, it's a pretty big area.

This is probably my favorite fact about the universe. These are such relatively simple processes, but the complexity that results is astounding.

Something that could benefit soceity in "some way". So if I had been able to do programming I could make an ai and study what makes a ai even though its already been done I could still say it could help further studies on ai. And something I'm capable of doing in terms of realism like if I were to do something on real life cars I couldn't cause I can't drive a car. 



If I said my question improperly or anything just tell me.
At his age/grade, there are two things that are really the best to aim for: Math, and programming. Most of physics requires calculus; it's just how the world works.

There is a shortcut though, and that is programming. When I was in 6th grade I made a basic physics engine for a moon lander style game (in adobe flash) and I was able to, within the span of a few months, learn some more advanced algebra, trigonometry, and without realizing it, calculus. Basically just by fumbling around trying to make physics in a videogame.

There are *loads* of resources out there for learning programming; Khan academy is pretty great for it, and there are resources for math there too.

Plain physics textbooks can be pretty rough at his age. Some kids are way into it, but it might be best to just nudge him towards some resources that will enable him to do more things later.
What does he want to know about ? For eihgth graders I'd recommend stuff towards science divulgation in general, such as Carl Sagan's Cosmos, Universe in A Nutshell and other stuff alike 
8th grade is a bit early for a physics textbook.  He would do better with a general physical science book geared toward that age.  Any of the major textbook companies physical science books should be pretty comparable, so just look for a cheap Pearson or Mcgraw-Hill or some such.  For actual intro physics I would go with Knight's algebra based text "College Physics: a Strategic Approach" (I've never read it but his calc based book is good), however I will warn that even introductory physics requires some harder algebra and trigonometry.  Since textbooks are expensive you may consider more general books about physics and science.

I think that the best general science intro books are [The Science of Discworld series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Discworld) but it kind of helps that I am a huge Discworld fan anyways.  This book may not make much sense to someone that has not read the Discworld series before but the premise is that Pratchett writes a chapter about a group of wizards doing experiments with magic, then the next chapter is a scientist explaining the real world analogue to the fantastical experiment ran by the wizards.

There is also Bill Bryson's "A short history of Nearly Everything" which is a very entertaining tour through science.  I know of at least one middle school teacher who uses this as his physical science text in 9th grade and the kids love it.
I was always a fan of Brian Greene when I was younger, "The Fabric of the Cosmos" is excellent! It definitely inspired me - it explains the strange developments of modern physics in a an easy to read and fascinating way.
I usually recommend "Understanding Physics" by Issac Asimov for people with an interest, but not a background in physics. It's pretty reader friendly, but might be a bit heavy for 8th grade.
The Cartoon Guide to Physics! It's a great introduction to everything from Newton to Einstein, and it's accessible to kids and adults alike. 
Michael faraday
Murray Gell-Mann had a really good talk @ Google too!
Look up the Navarro-Frank-White distribution/potential. Or search on arXiv.org for any of the older cosmological simulations, like the Millennium run.

Edit: [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5127) was on the first page of google results if you search for "milky way dark matter distribution".

On another note, it's a *huge* red flag to say "I have an idea, but I don't know enough about the topic to know if it's correct, but I also want to keep it a secret in case it turns out to be significant". When people say this sort of thing, their "theory" is always (a) something obvious that everybody in the field is already aware of (e.g. a different gravity law, various candidate particles) , (b) something obviously wrong, that anybody in the field could quickly disregard, or (c) not really even science (e.g. "all of time exists at once").

So there's no need for secrecy. I can guarantee that your theory is not valuable. But we *can* help you learn and get a better understanding of dark matter, if you like.
>I want to know estimated concentrations around (for instance) a specific galaxy (cluster), along with that galaxy (cluster)'s mass of normal matter and its velocity and so on.

You're mostly looking for information that doesn't exist. There's a lot of evidence for the existence of dark matter, but measuring where it is is very hard. You're limited to gravitational effects, which basically means you have to look at the distortion of light due to gravity. With the exception of microlensing, the only time we can see this is for objects the size of galaxy clusters. Here's an example, It's 2D and you're not going to be impressed with the accuracy. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bullet_cluster_lensing.jpg) is a contour map of the [Bullet Cluster's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster) gravitational field. Keep in mind, there are probably something on the order of 10s of galaxy clusters that have been studied this way - and this is probably the best studied among them.

If you want to test the theory in other ways, you have many options. Studying the motion of galaxies is the most obvious. Rotation curves are essentially what convinced people of the existence of dark matter in the first place. People also do large gravitational n-body simulations of the universe to study how hypothesized forms of dark matter result (or fail to result in) universes that look like ours. The cosmic microwave background has a whole lot of information that can be learned from it. I'm sure there are more, but I'm out of ideas for now.

Lastly, sorry but no ones going to take you seriously if you don't post your theory. Hundreds if not thousands of careers have gone into studying dark matter, so it's unlikely you've come up with something new and viable. Sorry to be blunt, but there's a lot of people that come here with similar claims.
Astrowiki is completely right. People in physics share ideas, it's how we work. People working in secrecy set off most physicists crackpot indicators. Also, when people don't know what the arxiv is, it is usually a strong indicator that they have very little familiarity with the field.

The thing about physics is that it's super well tested. Standard ideas like DM, despite not being understood thoroughly, is still very well tested as many people have written good papers coming at it from all sides. Of course there is still new work to be done, but knowing what is new requires knowing what is old (which is why knowing what the arxiv is is so important).

As for your question about DM, again, Astrowiki is right. NFW is a commonly used (although starting to show its age) DM distribution. There is then the core/cusp problem that can be handled with an additional parameter. For the density near the earth the canonical value is ~[0.3 GeV cm^-3](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9710337) , although people are starting to take a hard look at that number as well.

I can't really imagine being forced to do that before the first year. At my school, we were actually funded by the grad college (not the dept) for the first 1.5yrs so that we could explore/work with professors without needing them to commit to funding us. Of course they want a field on your application to try to make sure this is not an imbalance in their own dept. 
To my knowledge, none of them make you decide in your first year. For one thing, you generally have classes for a year before the qualifying exams, and for another you generally need to find a professor to even start your dissertation research. Now, it would still be nice to know approximately what area you want. That could include theory vs experiment, or even just be high energy physics. For example, if you don't want accelerator physics, you might want to think twice about Chicago schools. 

I know they might make you put down things on your applications, but I find it hard to imagine that any place you go to would make you stick with a choice like that. 
MSU physics doesn't make you decide first year, but you're given the option.
Yes! research experience is good. Learn everything, work really hard now.
Spintronics is a pretty hot field; definitely worth your time. There are a number of large older companies interested (Intel, IBM, HP, etc.), as well as some young ones (ST technologies, Avalanche tech, NVE). The technology is mature enough to see commercial applications already available, but not so mature that all interesting work is being done in industry. I'd say it is in a sweet spot currently.

In any case, as an undergrad you will find the experience to be extremely useful. Learning through physical work in a lab is a very different experience than from a textbook.
Yes. Maximise experience. Helping in a lab doesn't commit you to a career lol.
So I've been reading a review article on topological insulators by Fruchart and Carpentier (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.0255v2.pdf) and I'm have a few questions regarding the mathematical construction behind the fibre bundle.

Suppose I gave you the Hamiltonian h(k) defined over the Brillouin zone like is given in the review. How do I construct the fibre bundle in question? Clearly the Brillouin zone (torus) is the base space. But what are the fibers is it U(1) or a one dimensional vector spacae? How do I glue together these local trivializations to construct my total bundle?

Thanks!
What is the future of neutrino physics? We know they got the Nobel Prize in 2015, but where is it going? What are the current detectors/accelerators looking for? I know they're building the ESS in Sweden too, so what's the plan?

I know there are the three flavours with which the neutrino can oscillate through. I've been hearing things like sterile neutrinos, with links to dark matter even, and other things, but not really sure what they're looking for. I tried to find things through NOvA from Fermilab but the papers were rather in depth. I went to a talk on Bruno Pontecorvo, who worked a lot on neutrino, and it's piqued my interest a lot. 

Thanks for any help, or relevant links!
Lately I'be been trying to understand how the concept of a graviton fits in with GR. 

In my understanding, general relativity says that gravity is not in fact a force, but rather a consequence of the curvature of spacetime. So, if we were able to formulate a quantum theory of gravity that involves the graviton as a force carrier for gravity, how would that fit in with the curved spacetime of gravity? Does spacetime actually not have curvature, and is it rather just a convenient way to discuss gravity? Or is the force something to do with the curving of spacetime itself?

Thanks!
So I've got an embarassing question to ask:
Say you are trying to separate two liquids in a centrifuge. The centripetal force then acts upon these liquids. By my reasoning, the denser liquid should move to the inner part of the centrigure, since it has a higher mass, and thus a higher force acting upon it. (F = m*a) 

I know this is wrong, since obviously heavier things tend to move outward in a centrifure, but I have no idea why. Can somebody here help me out?

Question I'm working on, not quite sure what I'm doing wrong:

"An object on a level surface experiences a horizontal force of 14.0 N due to kinetic friction. If the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.37, what is the mass of the object in kg?"

Using Fk = μk * Nf, I plug in the numbers as follows: 14 N = 0.37 * m/9,8.  I get 370.8 kg as my answer for the mass, yet the questionnaire tells me I've got the wrong answer.  Help!
When defining the creation operator (a_i)+ for fermions on a Fock space, there's this funny phase factor coming from the Jordan-Wigner transformation that depends on how many total fermions are in the states labeled from 0 to i-1. I understand that this is necessary to obtain the right commutation relations, and that there needs to be a way to order the eigenstates you're working with. And I see that you can transform creation operators from one basis to another.

But what happens when your basis is, say, momentum? There's no way to order momenta for dimensions > 1. Are you forced to first define creation/annihilation operators over a countable eigenbasis, and then change to the momentum basis?
Kind of a basic question here. Trying to figure out what amount of weight I'm actually 'pushing up' during a push-up. Weight is 175lb. Basically in the push-up position I've determined that. When in the front leaning rest, given a height from floor to shoulder of about 1.5' and a length of 6 feet, the angle between the floor and the line along my back should be about 14 degrees (tan(x) = (1.5/6)). 

That being said I have no idea how to go about calculating what the forces actually are throughout this movement, but curious to find out. Could anyone walk me through this? 

Thanks in advance 
How was the formula v=(T/(m/L))^1/2 discovered for waves on a string?
Ah, haha what an obvious way to test this! Hadn't even thought of that. Brilliant. Thanks. I'd be curious to find out how this would be determined theoretically but alas - I don't want to cause you a huge headache if the process is less than easy. 
i'm not really a physicist, so i wouldn't know. would you agree that every action is a definite, & theoretically predictable reaction to another action? even on he quantum level? if not, what are some counter examples?
Any up to date materials on M-theory? needs to be 2016. August or newer. 
the market has been flooded by the US selling off its reserves since ~~WWII~~ the 70s. The only reason there is a "shortage" is because extraction is not justified by the reduced price caused by the selloff. there is more than enough helium to be had once the cost of extracting becomes justified by its market price.
Well, this is certainly a motivation to revv up fusion reactor research. Think of the amount of Helium you could produce!

Seriously though, are there any natural sources or artificial means of producing Helium?
Took a look at the report - seems like eliminating the "major helium requirement" volume threshold for federal grantees could be logistically problematic.  Also not sure how you'd go about convincing vendors to sell helium at what sounds like below market prices.   Do like the suggestion of subsidizing helium reclamation equipment though.
Nebraska football fans release helium balloons every time they score a touchdown. Quite disgraceful.
[According to the report, only 15% (PDF page 11)](https://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/upload/HeliumReport.pdf) is used for "other". My question is if this is purely an analysis of the industrial/scientific uses or if frivolous helium balloon use is included in this assessment?

My initial gut reaction was to cry for pitchforks toward frivolous users but if the "other" category is already that small, then it's really inter-departmental government, academic and industry supply and demand that must be better coordinated.
Someday kids won't know what they are seeing in an Apple message with balloons. 
Guess I should stop venting that dewar in the lab then 
Wont all the helium just go to the top of our atmosphere? I understand it will be way harder to get from there and cost more to do but its not getting 'depleted'...
Woop-de-doo? This needs to happen anyway to represent the actual value of helium. Again I say it, once the government stops dumping Helium (and hopefully they trail it off rather than suddenly stopping) on the market then prices will return to a natural level. It may put some uses out of general use and engineers will find other chemicals or methods to do what they need to do. This is expected and natural.
An inert element that likes to float up and disappear into space also really likes to escape containers. Nature truely doesn't give a fuck.
Just like helium.
If it's non renewable where do we get helium?
But there's so much of it just given away at McDonalds?
No, your education will not be irrelevant.  You will learn the same stuff more or less.  I do get the impression that undergrad classes at Havard-like universities are a bit more detailed and the homework perhaps a bit more rigorous, but for the most part the material is the same at the undergraduate level.

I went to a big state-funded school for undergrad before moving on to a top-tier school for grad school, so I have seen both sides of the coin.
You do not have to go to a Top 10 school in order to have a good career. Work hard - it will pay off. 
To echo the other comments. Sure it would be advantageous to attend a top 10 school, but this is not a requirement. Especially for undergrad. Work hard, produce results (especially in grad school) and while it may be a bit harder, it's not a death sentence to attend a lesser school. 
One thing that a lot of people fail to mention is that if you want to do research and plan on going to grad school, undergraduate research is the most important aspect of your application. Therefore, a school with strong research opportunities will definitely give you a leg up. If you go to a school with weak research, you could still find other research opportunities though. Best bet would be an REU (competitive and restricted to the summer, but they do like accepting from schools with low research) or do research at another school that is geographically near (Northeastern is close to MIT/Harvard, so not a bad choice)
As others mentioned, the name/prestige of the school doesn't matter too much. Plenty of talented students work hard and do well in less prestigious schools and this really pays off later with grad school admissions; the name of the school is irrelevant.  

You should be concerned about whether your institution is an "R1" school, which means that research and funding is well available to undergraduates. Having 1-2yrs of research experience in physics gives you a huge edge when it comes to grad school admissions. Another thing to consider, how large is the physics department? This is a good indicator of how the department's budget is. Are there only about 5-10 professors, or around 20-30? Keep these in mind while you're searching, but try not to be too picky :) best of luck
Pretty much, but that is a very euphemistic way to put it.

I like to think of it more as smashing your head against a brick wall over and over until it finally falls down, allowing you to take a step, only to reveal another brick wall behind it.
As someone nearing the end of undergrad who will eventually be starting on the grad school path, articles like this always make me a little depressed. They remind me of why I love physics while simultaneously reminding me that my significant other is training to be a teacher and teachers are severely penalized for moving around whereas physicists are penalized for staying in the same place. I have a lot of difficulty imagine a world where we break up or where I leave physics which leaves me wondering what the hell the future has in store...
This is why I am probably going to leave physics. I am smart enough and skilled enough that I can probably make it, I'm currently in my first post doc and if I worked hard could get a second.

But I'm not emotionally strong enough. I am not able to feel shitty about my work for months at a time only to finally do something. 

I feel like if I left for industry I would be able to have small victories on a monthly or weekly basis. Even if the work itself is less intellectually satisfying it will be more emotionally satisfying.

It sometimes seems the only people who really are successful in this field are either emotionally void robots, or workaholics who somehow get satisfaction from banging their head on the wall, just because they worked through the weekend and that is some intrinsic good to neglect family and friends.
"Epiphany, heresy, novelty, ingenuity, industry, ubiquity."
> The decade or so spent in low-paying jobs and moving from place to place, the importance of academic pedigree and personal recommendations for getting ahead, and the ultimately very low chance of landing a permanent position, all contribute to a deplorable lack of women and ethnic minorities in the field. This is apart from the usual overt or covert biases that make it difficult to break into the old boys’ club. I sincerely hope that we can overcome these institutional barriers


Oh the Guardian. Why did I expect this not to have some retarded bias behind it? It's the Guardian. There just has to be at least a tiny bit of conspiracy conjecture that the topic is misogynistic and/or racist, because it's impossible for the Guardian to publish anything that doesn't spread the dogma of religious feminism. Just... what the fuck? It's almost hilarious how forced the SJW nonsense was in the article.


It's as if they write reasonable articles, but then before publishing they have to give them to feminist censors who add in or remove things to inject the dogma.
I have never seen such a book.  The closest is likely "Fundamentals of Semiconductor Physics" by Yu and Cardona:

https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Semiconductors-Materials-Properties-Graduate/dp/3642007090/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1477406529&sr=8-1&keywords=fundamentals+of+semiconductor+physics+cardona

It has an extremely detailed chapter on group theory as it relates to crystal structure, transport and selection rules.  It does however go into the extreme nitty gritty.  So it is aimed at semiconductor physicists and does very little "hand waving" and has problems for practice.  So it is perhaps a "middle ground" solution.

It calls the section "A Pedestrian's Guide to Group Theory".  I'll let you be the judge if it truly is.
I'm sure I'll get told to GTFO, b group theoretical analysis is routine in solid state chemistry, so for an dirty hands-on introduction, likely your best bet will be some kind of vibrational spectroscopy textbook aimed squarely at chemists.

Good examples are Wilson's molecular vibrations (for gases and solids treated via the 'atoms in a neighbour potential' approach), Decius and Hexter's Molecular vibrations in crystals, or Sherwood's Vibrational spectroscopy of solids 

Kaxiras has a good book on solid state physics aimed squarely st material scientists that may be worth a look too.
The standard one I've seen are:


Symmetry principles in solid state and molecular physics by Melvin Lax

Group theory and quantum mechanics  Michael Tinkham


I also agree with /u/feellikeafapgod in that reading Chemistry-oriented books would be a very practical way to get started.

Stress tensor of a Newtonian fluid is 
P_{ij} = delta_{ij} P + rho v_i v_j - eta (d_i v_j + d_j v_i - 2/3 delta_{ij} (div . v)) - zeta \delta_{ij} (div . v)

So if we have an x-plane wave then P = P_0 e^(i k x), and v_x = v_0 e^(i k x), v_y = 0, v_z = 0, and 

P_{xx} = P + rho v_x^(2) - (4/3 eta + zeta) (dv_x/dx)
P_{zz} = P - (zeta - 2/3 eta) dv_x/dx

The differences are do to the non-linear convective term rho v_x^(2), and the viscosity terms.



The stress tensor for a fluid *without* the wave is diag(ρ,P,P,P) where ρ is the density and P the pressure, so I'm not sure why you think the yy and zz components should be zero when there's a wave.
Haha, won't work. High quality mass specs are still large instruments and the data you collect would only be one piece of the puzzle towards identification.
If you were looking for specific chemicals it might be easier to create a cup that will change color due to a reaction with that chemical or create a tablet that will react in a certain way with what you're looking for.

It might be possible that something like certain drugs in a drink will absorb a certain wavelength of light that you can buy as an LED. Then you could build a simple detector. Try to find spectra for the chemicals you are interested in.
A mass spec requires a pretty big magnet, some way of accelerating (ionized) particles to a known energy, and a detector to pick up the spread so we can calculate relative masses.

Unfortunately, these things are larger than a cup.
I love this guy. His lectures really helped me through physics 1 & 2

> So i watched a video about it (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqk3TKuGNBA ) which really helped me out,

My advice: forget everything you just watched.

A lot of science popularizers, in an attempt to be "helpful", draw artificially rigid distinctions between law, theory, hypothesis and so on. I get the impression that this trend comes from people who argue creationists and wanted an easy way to defeat "evolution is just a theory" types. If "theory" is to represent "a body of work substantiated by... blah blah blah", then you can just shut down the objection with an argument by semantics.

Of course, things are not so simple. First, such an argument is extremely weak. The correct response when people attack evolution as "just a theory" is to point out the evidence in support of the theory, not to fuss about the meaning of the word in the first place. If one objects that science neophytes might not know the evidence for evolution in detail, then they have no business debating it in the first place. I can't say I support this effort. It smacks too much of creating an army of unthinking drones to act as political cannon fodder and it just rubs me the wrong way, no matter how objectively right the cause is.

With that out of the way, I'll rebuke a few specific points in the video, since I think it is both condescending and wrong.

>Words like "fact", "theory", "hypothesis" and "law" mean something totally different to a scientist than they're used in everyday speech.

Not really. The vast majority of the time, when a scientist says something is a "fact" or a "hypothesis", it means just what you'd expect. He says "facts" are "observations about the world around us" and "we observe things every day, like that it's bright outside". Well, that's exactly how most people use the word, isn't it? No need to further the disconnect between scientists and the public by pretending we have our own ivory tower approved versions of a common word such as "fact", that are much better than your peasant non-scientist facts, yes sir.

"Hypothesis"... well, I've never seen this word be used in anything other than scientific contexts, and there it always means the same thing. 

Moving on, the big problem with this whole shebang appears. A theory is a "a well substantiated explanation acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation". Well, is it? Let's take a look at some things that scientists call "theories" and see if they fit this paradigm.

* The **theory of evolution** does seem to fit the paradigm. Unsurprising, since it's the one the definition was tailor made to fit. Check!
* The **theory of relativity** does seem to fit the paradigm. Check!
* **Group theory** is an abstract piece of mathematics that has ample application in physics. It, much like nearly everything that gets the name "theory" in mathematics, does not fit the above paradigm. It already hints that there's more to this "theory" business than you've been told.
* **Density functional theory** is a computational tool often used by nuclear physicists. It's not a theory in the above sense.
* **String theory** has never been tested, much less confirmed, and it may never be. Whether it was acquired through the scientific method is a matter of (not very useful) debate.
* **Phi fourth theory** is a fictional toy model used to teach particle physics. It not even meant to represent reality, and so it's pointless to test. 
* By the way, **field theory** is a general framework to build particle physics models and is not a theory in the above sense. As a matter of fact, nearly everything that particle physicists call "theories", such as **Yang-Mills theory**, **Seiberg-Witten** theory, **Chern-Simons theory** and so on, refer simply to objects constructed in the field theory paradigm. The vast majority of "theories" to a particle physicist are not even meant to represent reality, just like the phi-fourth toy theory.
* **Lattice field theory** is a computational tool for doing field theory calculations. Whether or not the field theory in question is supposed to represent reality or not is entirely up to the researcher in question.
* **Inflation** in cosmology often gets called a "theory" despite the fact that nobody knows what the hell it is or how it happened, and there's little hope of ever actually finding out.
* **Chaos theory**, very dear to nonlinear dynamics people, is again more of a branch of mathematics, of the study of certain types of differential equations, than a model of much of anything. 
* The **Rayleigh-Jeans theory** of blackbody radiation was never experimentally confirmed, and it could never be, since it predicted an absurd result known as the "ultraviolet catastrophe" that led to the development of quantum mechanics. 
* The **miasma theory of disease** never passed rigorous scientific tests, nor was it discovered through scientific means. It was just the pseudoscientific belief that diseases are caused by vaguely defined "bad air".
* **Phlogiston theory** is how people thought fire happened before they actually knew how fire happened. 
* The **emission theory of vision** is how people thought we saw, by emitting light rays, before they realized we can only see light reflected from other sources. 

There are also things that are "theories" in the pop-science definition, but that aren't often called that. Examples include:

* **Thermodynamics** is, without any exaggeration, the single most reliable piece of knowledge possessed by the human species. It fits the definition of theory to a T, and because of its ample experimental and theoretical support, is almost guaranteed to never be replaced. The Standard Model will be replaced in the next 50 years. General relativity might be replaced in a slightly longer timeframe. I'll be extremely surprised if thermodynamics gets replaced. You never see people calling thermodynamics a theory, and it sounds extremely weird if you do.
* The **standard model** of particle physics gets that humble name, "model". 
* **Classical mechanics** is almost never called a theory.
* Newton's **universal gravitation** is a theory of gravity, almost never so described.

I could go on, but I think I made my point. 

He proceeds to explain that evolution is a fact, and that there is a "theory" to explain it. This is correct, and a point that should be emphasized. Similarly, "gravity" is an observation, and general relativity is a theory. Later in the video he claims it's both a "law and a theory". This is unambiguously wrong.

> "Evolution has been tested more than any other theory we know of"

Yeah, no, sit down son. Now you've left reality. He's also ignoring the very thing he *just said*: evolution, the observation, is extremely well-tested. The *theory* of how evolution happens? Not nearly as much. It receives constant revisions and there's much about it that isn't well understood. It's wrong to parade it around as the pinnacle of human understanding. We shouldn't be ashamed of this. It is the truth.

Besides, we all know that the pinnacle of human understanding is actually thermodynamics :P

> A law is a statement based on repeated experimental observations that describes some phenomenon of nature

Yeah, this one isn't necessarily true either. I'll refrain from posting examples because I already went too long, though.

> A law doesn't describe what is happening or why... for that, we need a theory.

More artificial distinction. The notion of "explaining why" is naturally very 
subjective in science, because you can always go back one step.

Why does a car roll downhill? Because it has potential energy that can be turned into kinetic energy. Why does that happen? Because there is a quantity called "energy" which is conserved by the vast majority of physical processes. Why is it conserved? Because it's usually irrelevant *when* an experiment is performed -- I can do it today, or tomorrow, and get the same answer. A mathematical statement known as Noether's theorem implies that if the laws of physics don't change with time, a quantity will be conserved, which we call "energy". Why are the laws of physics independent of time? Well I have no clue. 

What's worse, in his example, he claims that general relativity "explains" Newton's law of universal gravitation. In actuality, if you work it out, you'll find that gravity in Einstein's world behaves *differently* than what Newton predicts. In the language he just defined, and which he himself can't keep straight, Newton's law of universal gravitation is a theory, while Einstein's general relativity is a competing theory. Einstein's explains more stuff, so it wins. Newton's laws are only valid as approximations.

The notion that a law describes a phenomenon and a theory explains it is, frankly, infantile. It doesn't survive the most superficial scrutiny. Think of almost anything that gets called a "theory" and see how many actually 'explain' the phenomenon they purport to describe, in some subjective sense. The theory of relativity, for sure, does not. And so on.

TL;DR: It's unsurprising that you're confused about how the terms are used, and that you're confused about how certain terms are (or aren't) distinguished. Truth is, the vast majority of the time, scientists will call something whatever they feel like calling it. And balls to the pop science definition. That's just the truth.


A law is just a mathematical relationship that holds over a (generally wide) range of parameter space. There's nothing magical about the word that makes it an immutable truth of nature.
Generally: Theory > Law. Though as others have said there's a certain amount of "semantic" taste involved.

In my mind, a theory is essentially an entire (usually mathematical) framework that essentially provides precise quantitative answers to precise quantitative queries.  It doesn't just describe how two experimentally measurable quantities relate to each other, it provides a full toolbox in which one can essentially predict the outcome of any experiment (in principle) that involves the phenomena it is designed to model.  

An example might be Quantum Theory.  Want to know what frequencies of light helium gas will absorb?  "Ask" quantum theory (i.e. use the mathematical framework to calculate it).  Want to know how pure iron will compress?  Ask quantum theory.  Want to know how current travels through a semiconductor heterojunction for a transistor?  Ask quantum theory.  If it involves atoms or electrons or the collective behavior of atoms and electrons (i.e. bulk material properties), you ask quantum theory. 

Conversely, laws are essentially a point where someone noticed that, in the experiments they'd seen, some simple mathematical relation seemed to hold between two quantities.  Gravitational force and separation, pressure and volume, voltage and current, etc.  They made no attempt to really understand WHY this was true and if it was always true.  As a result, almost every "law" in physics is known to be wrong in general.  For example, Ohm's law says that current is proportional to voltage.  But this is only true for some materials in some situations (which, in true circular reasoning fashion, is called "the Ohmic region" of a material, so Ohm's law applies in the Ohmic region...).  Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation?  Superceded by General Relativity in 1915 (the thing Einstein is famous for).  Boyle's Law?  Only true if the molecules in the gas don't strongly interact with one another.  And so on.

Thus, from this perspective, a "law" is a "bold claim that asserts a simple mathematical relation that matches most existing data".  It is not a complete framework and it has no conceptual underpinning.  They are also generally only true under certain conditions.

A principle is much like a law but it is more a conceptual claim then a quantitative relationship.  The Principle of Least Time (light follows the path that minimizes the time of traversal), The Pauli Exclusion Principle (no two fermions can be in the same state), etc.  Thus it is another "bold simple claim" but of a different character than "the force due to gravity is proportional to both masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation".
A good law or model has to be elegant. It must more simply describe events and accurately than other models. It's fruitful, it has many consequences and improves our understanding of events in existence well beyond what was known before. It must also substantially simplify previously not well understood phenomena.

For instance Mendeleev's Period Chart of the elements. He began to see patterns in the characteristics of the elements. The alkali metals, the ferrous metals, the halogens, and the noble gases. His arrangements led directly to an understanding of bonding as the alkali metals have a charge of +1. The Halogen, -1, and thus they can bond in a 1:1 ratio. It explained chemical bonding as well, you see. 

His simple rules led to the discovery and production of many more elements because his arrangement found empty spots in the series. So, it was also fruitful as well as organizing the elements simply, too. and it led to the finding of the catalytic series of elements, Ni, Pt, Pt, too. & the rare earths, the radium series, and the transuranides in this last century, too.

so the rules of his organization of the elements led to much more chemistry and physics, insights & findings and fundamental  rules,as well. Leading to QM, and chemistry, and so on.
Putting a presentation together for group meeting, and compiling results into a paper (this one never ends).
Just put an article onto the arXiv, trying to finish up writing another article to put on the arXiv before getting started on a new project. All while trying to balance this with an awful teaching assignment (I'm TAing a grad course with ~65 people enrolled and I have to grade weekly homeworks). Looking forward to getting back to the fun part of physics.
lectures started again. this semester i got "particle and nuclear physics" ,  "solid-state physics"  and "thermodynamics and statistical physics".

the main workload however is going to be because of some practical work we have to do. basically every friday until christmas. 

we were told that it will take 8 hours of preperation, 8 hours of work in the lab and 8-25 hours to analyse the data and write a report.

atleast we got topics we liked, although we didnt get our favorites.

we got: 

"beta-decay"

"lifetime of myons"

"Photoemission spectroscopy"

"optical emission and absorption spectrums"

"nuclear reactor"

"transversal vibrating reed magnetometer"

"Optical coherence tomography"

"activity determination radioactive samples"

 first one starting this week.

also had to get more familiar with latex.

In my underclassmen calculus-based physics course, we were discussing linear momentum. Then out of nowhere our professor starts talking about relativistic momentum and derives E=mc^2. I sat there taking notes in awe and total confusion.
Currently reapplying to grad school, and I'm remembering how much I hate writing statements of purpose.
It's obviously wrong. Looking at his document: http://www.csc.kth.se/~cgjoh/ambsquantum.pdf

If our (for example) two-body wavefunction is p(x1,x2), the author claims that p(x1,x2)=p1(x1)p2(x2). (page 20)

In reality, this is just a rank 1 approximation of p(x1,x2), and representing the wavefunction that way means that you can't capture entanglement effects or anything like that.

This doesn't bother the author; he simply declares that this means that the pauli exclusion principle doesn't apply to electrons, and that making electron wavefunctions antisymmetric doesn't matter (page 21). 

This is, of course, obviously wrong. If the quantum many-body problem were so easy that you could simply declare p(x1,x2)=p1(x1)p2(x2) and be done with it, then people wouldn't have been working on the problem (with only minimal success) for last 100ish years.

*Edit*: I just realized why he doesn't notice that he's wrong. He uses the helium atom as an example, and notes that his approach gets the correct answer - that's because of spin degeneracy! (i'm assuming his results are right, I didn't double check his work) The electrons actually are in the same state for the ground state of the helium atom. If he tried this with Lithium or something then it wouldn't work.
This is incompatible with QM. It just assumes all wavefunctions and separable, and then drones on and on on how this reduces immensely the dimension of the state space... well, duh.

So apparently the explanation for entanglement is that entanglement never happens.
I never saw why a human mind should have any special role. How is a bunch of atoms different if it forms a mind vs. if it forms a rock? And when exactly does a human start to have a mind that counts as mind?

> the wave function for each electron

I would have at least expected something compatible with special relativity.

Nice article, didn't know about the flywheel either!

Where did you get that Palmeiras shirt, /u/A_R_K ?
> with a PhD in quantum information theory

Outside of research, most PhDs in your field would probably be found in consulting, IT, or anything with numbers (statistics, number crunching, (non-trivial) business analytics, (maybe) technical simulations). All of these jobs would very likely be unrelated to quantum physics.

Talk to people you know. Then, talk to people who work on interesting stuff. Then, find one of the web sites that have academic jobs in Germany. I remember this one: https://www.pro-physik.de/phy/stellenmarkt/jobsHome.html
I saw this documentary called TimeCop a few years ago. They might need need a quantum information theory consultant. 
I know Copenhagen, Denmark has a lot going on right now. DTU and the Niels Bohr Institute have made a couple of companies and research centers (Qdev, Qbiz, Sparrow quantum etc.) that are based on quantum information. Some call it the future "Quantum Valley".
Data Science...
Matt Strassler just came out with [a follow-up blog post](https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/10/25/cms-has-an-interesting-result/) to this one in which he "highlighted the importance of looking for low-mass particles whose interactions with known particles are very weak."  He talks about a tip he received from Professor Matt Reece on a recent paper involving a search of this type (but was not obvious from the paper's title). 

He also wanted to correct an impression that some had on reading the original post - his main point is to stress the need to be doing this type of search, not that he thinks the analysis of the ALEPH experiment's data by Arno Heister actually found something hidden, but he urges a  "focus on the constraints that one can obtain, and the potential discoveries that one could make, with this type of analysis, either at LEP or at LHC."
That refers to the [metric signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_signature#Signature_in_physics), i.e. the convention if the time coordinate has a negative sign and spatial coordinates positive sign, or vice versa.
The line element is the differential form of the Pythagorean theorem for spacetime. In Euclidean space it is ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 +dz^2 . When you start dealing with spacetime instead of space, you need a time component, which has the opposite sign of the spatial components. For Minkowski space for example it is ds^2  = -c^2 dt^2 dx^2 + dy^2 +dz^2 , although some people who are perverted and wrong make the time part positive and the spatial parts negative. Having it + - - - and - + + + are the two signature conventions.
The wiki page on [Sylvester's law of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester%27s_law_of_inertia) has a good explanation.
You're thinking of quantum entanglement I believe 
You might be talking about quantum entanglement.

It's what I'm currently researching.
Math! Get good at calculus at a minimum. If you can, take vector calculus, linear algebra, anything. 
I'm gonna agree with the other poster. Math is the biggest stumbling block for most people when it comes to higher physics courses. Beyond calculus I think the most important subject to learn is linear algebra.

You might also try watching the Susskind lectures on quantum mechanics, or reading Griffith's QM.

Further along in QM and particle physics, group theory becomes very important as well.
Howdy. I was in a similar boat not too long ago. I went to a CC, transferred to a university, was an EE major for a bit, then switched to computer engineering and physics.

Both EE and Physics are super math intensive. So for the most part I'd be concerned about doing well in your intro physics classes and building a strong foundation in math. Calculus, Linear Algebra, Diff EQs, and Stats are gonna show up in your EE and Physics upper level courses. Get good at those now so you already know it/can relearn it easily in the future.

As far as preparing for Modern, Classical Mechanics, and E&M goes: sure you can try and teach yourself those subjects. At least peruse some textbooks so you know what you'll be in for. Just keep in mind you'll still have to take those classes when you transfer.
Having B- average is going to ding you. Most graduate schools require a minimum of a 3.0 average across all previous coursework in order to be accepted. 

That said, if you ace the general GRE, the physics GRE [I strongly recommend this book for it. It saved my ass](https://www.amazon.com/Conquering-Physics-GRE-Yoni-Kahn/dp/1479274631), have research experience and solid letters of rec you'll probably be able to find a place. 

As to if you *should* go to graduate school or not, that's a tougher question. I'm only a first year graduate student, but people in the program I'm in came for a variety of reasons. Some people want to learn quantitative skills and then go straight into finance/consulting ( although they're rare), some people want to get a job working in industry as soon as they graduate, some people want to try to go in academia after their PhD. There are plenty of good reasons to go to grad school in physics; I'm here because I enjoyed my research experience as an undergrad and thought physics was the coolest thing around and wanted to learn more of it and keep doing it, but I don't have any idea of what I want to do afterwards. 

There are definitely some reasons *not* to go into graduate school though. Don't go into grad school for physics because nothing else looks appealing and you just don't know what else do to. Don't go into it with the expectation of making a ton of money down the road. 

In my opinion the only good reason to go to graduate school in physics is that you think physics is awesome and want to do it 40-70 hours a week every week for the next 5-7 years of your life. You can have other reasons too ( jobs, career goals, ect) but that should be the core. 

If you're roughly 20 when you enter graduate school, it takes you 6 years, and you die when you're 80, you'll be spending 10% of the rest of your life in graduate school. Sit down and think about that and ask yourself " Am I ok with being a graduate student for one out of every 10 days I have left in my life?"

If the answer isn't an enthusiastic "Yes!" you really should reconsider whether graduate school is for you. 
Honestly, just get an engineering masters and get a decent job, phd really isn't worth it unless you really love physics and even then a career in physics is unlikely.  
If you are really skeptical, don't do a PhD program. Work, make money, save as much money as you can, and continue to figure out what you want. I assume you are young? What is your ideal job?
Your B- is definitely going to hurt. I couldn't get in anywhere with my 3.3 (out of 4.0), even with my extensive research experience and academic references from across the country. Your double major could definitely help, but a lot of it might come down to your Physics GRE score.

[Here's](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/practice_book_physics.pdf) a sample test, there are others you can find and resources you can use to study from.

Also, have you done any undergrad research at all? Your ability to solve classroom problems doesn't translate well to your ability to do research. So when you have problems with the intuition, that doesn't mean you can't handle a PhD. Getting through graduate school is about determination and putting in the work. And if you can find an area of research that can benefit from your Mechanical Engineering degree, then you'll have an advantage over other students.
I'll tell you what I've told numerous students that have asked me if they should do a PhD. You may not like or understand it and you may think there is a hidden sub context but there isn't. Here goes.

There is only one reason why you should do a PhD: You really, really want to; to the point where you can't imagine who you'll be if you don't do it. If you've got any other reasons but not this one, forget about it, do something that'll give you a job , money and life fulfilment.

Particularly in Physics, if you think your PhD will give you money, a carer, a job, recognition and even respect you are 95% mistaken. It will not. A PhD is 95% struggle, disappointment, patience, persistence, boredom, stress, more stress, so much stress and endless repetition of trivial tasks that have nothing to do with what you imagine research is about.

Dat 5% tho, when things work and you realise you're genuinely the only person in the world doing what you do, that makes the rest worth it. This is for me the only reason why anyone should ever do a PhD, so have a chat with yourself and decide.

I'm sorry if I come across as negative but I think you should know the truth. I did a PhD in experimental Physics because I could not even contemplate not continuing studying Physics, and 6 years later I would not change a thing. Having seen what it's like though, the only thing that kept me going is that I wanted to do it and could not have it any other way.

TL;DR: Do it for the love, not for anything else. 

*drops mic*
Yeah, the only reason someone should get a PhD is if they want to do research. And even then I would really recommend doing some summer research projects to get a taste of what research is before making up your mind.
"A" PhD is too general, what kind of PhD? And where?

I would personally stay away from hard-core physics fields unless the field is truly your passion. I am not very convinced that you will get anywhere for example after a PhD in exotic particles (ouside of CERN, Fermilab and co). Of course you can always get a "normal" job after, but you will end up competing with fresh graduates on equal stand because your PhD will not be valued much.

On the other hand, a hands-on PhD in industry relevant topics (i.e. applied physics) can open you some doors, and would mix well with your mechanical engineering knowledge. Talking about battery research, materials, electronic devices, mechatronics...

Finally, I did my own PhD in the Netherlands, but I had contact with doctorates from pretty much all over the world. From what I heard, I cannot recommend U.S. PhDs, you have a high chance of stagnating for 6+ years until graduating. In Europe in general you will dedicate 4 years (3 in UK, although it does not include the writing part _which you are not paid for_), which is much more reasonable. Places like Denmark, NL are pretty good (you get paid, treated and have the legal status of a worker, not a student and you will get by in English), Germany is not so great (low wage, expect lots of teaching to make some decent living)...

So, I would do a bit of research about topics and places. And pick something that you like, I can 90% guarantee you that after three years on it you will have a love/hate feeling for the topic, but you will push through. On the other hand if you just land "any" PhD without much interest... not good.
You should think carefully about what it is you want to do. Having passion and interest in a subject is great, but it's that doesn't necessarily translate to a sustainable career. Especially if you're interested in theoretical physics.
I'm not going to tell you yes specifically to this plan, but I do generally endorse the idea of going straight to a PhD if you think you want to. It's a lot easier to keep being a student than it is to go back to being a student. 
The way I've had it explained to me is that if you feel the need to question whether or not it's the right call, then it's not the right call. For physics, getting a PhD seems to be something done far more out of passion than practicality.
What about job availability and the "over-qualification" curse? How much consideration should be given to that dilemma?

That is what I would be concerned with most.
Have you done any research? I would not recommend going into a graduate program unless you are confident you enjoy doing research in that field.

A physics Ph.D. will train you to be a physics researcher and the training is brutal. If you enjoy that, go for it! Your grades will damage your chances, but a good research record can make up for it.

If you don't like research, run. Run far away.

If you haven't tried research, I recommend getting a summer internship (maybe an REU if you're in the u.s.) before even considering grad school.

I have to admit I'm also surprised and a little concerned that you, for example, did not say *which* topics in physics you'd like to study. Grad school is about specialization. It's where you become the world's leading expert in a tiny sub-area of a tiny sub-field. Do you like theory or experiment? What about computational physics? Are you into AMO, high energy, condensed matter, quantum information, gravity, plasmas, turbulence or something else?

If you haven't thought about these questions you need to find answers before you look at grad school. And the search for answers might help you figure out what you want to do.
Don't do a PhD unless you are pretty certain that you want to do it. A PhD is a long process (at least 4 years) and there will be plenty of days where you feel like quitting. 
If you're unsure, then don't do it, it's not the right thing for you. Only do it if you *really* want to and it's not even a question. Physics is fascinating, but a PhD is a whole other thing.

I started a PhD program after undergrad because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. Apart from getting a M.S. out of it, that was a mistake.
Just to chime in my 2 cents, I also loved physics but had a pretty bad GPA in first semester (just under a 3.0). I usually needed a lot more help than other students, and never really felt I was very good at the subject. I applied for grad schools but didn't get in anywhere. Started a B.Ed. towards becoming a secondary teacher. Found the program really unrewarding, so I tried one more time to get into an MSc. program. Got into UManchester, where I did my MSc. Lo and behold I was really good at research, and did quite well in the program. Now I'm doing my PhD in Paris and again I find I am not having much trouble keeping up with my research, and love being part of the scientific community. So just to let you know undergrad and research are two very different things, and you can be bad at one and good at the other.
I'd say if you're not 100% sure you want to do it at this point, it may not be for you. You're not going to become *more* excited about it as you get deeper into the program. 

 I was 100% sure for two years before I began applying. I was 100% sure for my first 3 years of grad school. But even my love of the subject and the enjoyment I got from doing it every single day wasn't enough to prevent me from sometimes regretting my decision 7 years later when I finally finished my PhD. If academia is not your dream place, and even if it is, it very well may become hell if you go into a certain field or get stuck in a certain group or things don't go as you wish. If you want to make money in industry, get a Master's in mechanical engineering. Only do a PhD if you plan to be a research physicist or a professor. 
I have to say that nothing in your post gave me any indication that a physics PhD is a strong choice for you. I loved physics, had good grades and I struggled for a variety of reasons doing a physics PhD. If you love physics, there are many careers that you can do that involve physics-type thinking eg engineering, programming, IT, finance, even bio-tech.

You could try to take on a small research project in physics and see how you get on. But honestly, nothing you've said makes it sound like a good idea to do a PhD. Lots of people study physics as part of their studies (like engineers or doctors) and they often love it but doing it as a career is very different.
It's all about the pGRE. 850 or better gets you in.
Hello there, fellow BITSian :-)
Physics is also what I'm considering to study at uni. I would like to know too. Is getting a PhD pretty much required to get employed. I have heard so much that if you don't have one you may find it difficult to get a job.
Do it. Physics is great, and if you can get into grad school, they generally pay you to study and do research. If you change your mind half way through, leave with a masters. Worst possible case is that you spend a bunch of money applying to grad schools and sending GRE scores, then get rejected. So you might possibly lose like $300 applying to schools. 
YES.


Edit: You fucks downvote but have no idea why I said YES!

Here is the reason; "I find Physics immensely fascinating and I loved studying the courses."

Enough reasoning.  Screw the  GPA, its about passion.
The best thing that you can do is take care of your physical and mental health needs: eat healthy foods, get enough sleep, exercise regularly (particularly cardiovascular exercise), and spend time relaxing with friends.

It may seem like an indulgence to do those things when you have a lot of work to get done, but it isn't. Doing those things consistently will keep your stress levels low and will improve your ability to focus and think clearly. All of which will enable you to do better, higher-quality work in the time that you spend working.
Same here!  taking some real break time help me a little, doing sport etc... but the amount of work is really hiting my nerves too :/
Having something to look forward to with a clear deadline for when it would be over worked for me. I booked a trip for just after I finished my honours and left like a week after my defence. It helped me to know that there was something coming up where I could have a break from responsibilities and it was far away from uni too.
General Relativity and Cosmology: Unsolved Questions and Future Directions, by Debono and Smoot  https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09781
By definition, all the papers in the journal 'Reviews of Modern Physics' give a technical overview of some subfield of physics. Usually the scope of these articles is very narrow but there are some which are reasonably broad, which may be of interest to you.
[This](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167572915000114) paper is a very recent and very good review article on the field of molecule-surface interactions, focussing specifically on porphyrines and phthalocyanines.
The Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) Long Range Plan gives an overview of everything happening in nuclear science (basically nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry) and the direction in which we want the field to go. I don't want to link to it because it's a huge PDF, but it's easily found on Google.
For technical reviews of particle physics check out 'Particle Data Group' pdg.lbl.gov
Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman grew up in a different time. Don't compare your situation now to their situation almost a century ago. Not only were the finances different, but the way physics was done was different. 

That being said I'm on the side of get the most bang for your buck. If money is at all a concern for you then you should not spend it to get your undergrad. You can still learn and do physics at UCF. 

As a side question: Don't they have a strong AMO program there? I've never heard of NYU's optics program but I've definitely heard of UCF's. Just because UCF isn't a private school doesn't mean they don't do good physics.
NYU is not worth the money for undergrad. As it stands today it is far better just to go to your local state school, work really (really) hard and get into a good grad school, which is what really matters for physics. It'll be better for your mental health as well, and your likeliness to simply graduate. Generally your likeliness to graduate is tied not to your absolute competence, but your competence compared to your colleagues. That is, the talent concentration of prestigious universities makes it more taxing on your mental health and will make it more difficult to compete for intra-mural scholarships, research, internships, etc. Of course, attending a very top university like Caltech would probably be worth it, but extremely expensive places like NYU, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Rice, Duke, etc. don't really justify their cost for undergrad.
First off, it is possible to attend any university physics program, work really hard, get published, get good test scores, and have a successful physics career.  However, the bigger the name of the university you go to the easier it is to get into grad school, get a research job post graduation, obtain fellowships, etc.

As much as people don't like to admit it.  Independent of what you're doing, name recognition is one of the easiest ways to get in the door and physics is one of the fields most guilty of basing decisions on name.  If you choose to go to a school with a better name, in my experience things will be a lot simpler for you.

When I was in grad school (large state school) there were many of my fellow students who lamented their decision to choose schools based on research interest over something like that rather than simply name recognition.  For you, thinking about undergraduate the same will be the case when you apply for graduate school.  The school you go to fun undergrad is the first thing admissions sees when they look at your application.  I am not saying you can't go to UCF, or even that going to UCF will make it unlikely for you to get into a good grad school, I am just saying that it will make it harder (compared to a school with a more recognizable name like NYU).
Thank you, what you said has been helpful and I feel better about my situation now
I went to a smaller less known university for undergrad, and now I'm at a better known university in grad school. 

The small school gave me a cozy environment to learn in. There were fewer than a dozen physics faculty, so I was able to get to know every one of them fairly well, and all of them were happy to spend time with me if I needed it. 

Here at the better known university, the focus is unapologetically on research. The class sizes are an order of magnitude larger. This is a great place to be a graduate student, but if I had come here for undergrad then I doubt I would have learned physics as well... and I don't think I'd ever have learned to love it. 

That's only an anecdote, of course, but frankly I wouldn't be surprised if the correlation between school cost and education quality is tenuous at best. If your end goal is have a prestigious university name on your resume, go for it, but if you ask me, your priorities should be manageable cost and a location/environment that you feel comfortable living in.  
If you are looking at private schools, do consider that they may have financial aid for you. You might also look into small schools. A place like Harvey Mudd or Williams has a strong reputation for sending students to grad school. 
in any sane country it doesn't matter (europe.). in fact university education is free in many countries (in germany it;s free again).
This is a little more focused on the microcontroller, but many of the basics you mention are also involved: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12060
My E&M professor explained this to us in 1988.  How far back does it go?  Who first started telling this grim tale of impending (or not, how could anybody know) doom?
The Schrodinger equation on the blackboard at [4:10](https://youtu.be/ijFm6DxNVyI?t=249) is incorrect...
What if the "collapse" already happened and the "new" laws of physics are the ones we are perceiving now?
ELI experimental phycisist: What is the effect of curvature on the stability of a false vacuum? Is it possible for a false vacuum to be the lowest energy state in the vicinity of a black hole?
I saw this when it came out and a thought occurred to me. I'm no physicist so please bear with my silly conjectures. Why does the proposed energy state need to be lower in order for vacuum decay to be a thing? Let me clarify, if were using geographical analogy, couldn't there exist a second energy valley that's locally stable but at a slightly higher energy level than where the field is currently. Couldn't the field be theoretically perturbed into this higher energy state and remain there until a sufficiently strong stimulus throws it out again? Wouldn't this then be possible for a lot of other fields and not just the higgs?

I'm assuming the reason it cant is because the energy of the field as a whole would have to increase and you can't do that without huge energy transfers where as the scenario proposed here is energy neutral? That sounds reasonable to me but i know little about the subject.
To repeat something I said in another thread, the statement that we have no idea what happens when the Higgs field is turned off in the true vacuum and Standard Model is superseded by new physics is wrong. The Standard Model handles that transition just fine; it's the whole point of the Higgs mechanism. The universe is governed by the electroweak force and massless fermions with chiral symmetry, yes, but it's still within the purview of the Standard Model.
So this is like the universe's brain aneurysm, if it exists.
So, let us say this occurred 8 billion light years away and The Nothing is hurling at us at light speed. We wouldn't see The Nothing coming, but we SHOULD detect an anomalous lack of "stuff" that's 8.5bly away directly on the other side of The Nothing, just the same way we notice black holes and high gravity galaxies via gravitational lensing. We can't detect it directly, but we should be able to detect it indirectly.
 O sorriest it is just the reset switch on the game simulation we are all part of.
There are certainly optical microscopes that use non-visible light. UV confocal microscopes come to mind for higher resolution based on the shorter wavelength. There are also IR  microscopes on the other side of the spectrum that are useful for looking through things that aren't transparent in the visible spectrum, however, these typically have lower resolution both due to the longer wavelength and the IR camera necessary to "see" the images. 

Electron microscopes use electromagnetic lenses to accomplish beam forming and focusing of the electrons. Also, the detector is a single element, not an array like in optical microscope cameras. That is why the scanning electron microscope was developed to create 2d raster images. 

Another aspect of using electrons is that they are charged particles and therefore can show other effects like charging if you try to image a dielectric material, for example. 


By far the best resource I know of for a semi-layman is:

http://theoreticalminimum.com

by Leonhard Suskind. Its mainly a video series but he  also wrote two books with the same title. The video lectures cover almost every aspect of modern physics. 
 Fenyman's lectures in general are worth a read
The Elegant Universe by Brain Greene 
Seven Brief Lessons on Physics by Carlo Rovelli
Feynman's Lectures series are great. If you are looking for some focused study on the topic of 'Modern Physics' itself, then Modern Physics by Arthur Beiser might be helpful. 
For quantum mechanics *Quantum Reality* is ~~very good~~ mind blowing.

For special relativity, Taylor and Wheeler's *Spacetime Physics,* though it does contain problems and equations.

For dark matter, Lisa Randall's *Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs.*

For cosmology, I'd recommend Primack's *View from the Center of the Universe*.

Also, you might try Isaac Asimov's *Understanding Physics.*

But your best bet is to just go to your local library's Physics section, skim the books' openings and pick whatever suits you. There's plenty to choose from.

is there a more scientific article/paper for that? cant stand the blabla. i need formulas and hamiltonians.
Honestly, that would be a relief.  I'd feel bad for Perlmutter et al.  Has a Nobel prize ever been given, in any field, for research that was subsequently disputed/invalidated?  Do they get an awkward call from Sweeden early in the morning?
This might be oversimplifying things, but if cosmology is still hinged on questionable distance measures, that should probably be the top of our priority list.

Why not send out 2 or 3 small space telescopes into opposite directions, say to L1 and L3, and use very very long baseline interferometry to finally nail down some distances?  Then we could calibrate all these standard candles.
CMB measurements alone give strong evidence for dark energy - no supernovae needed.
If dark energy doesn't exist, what makes up the energy content for flat spacetime?
Being totally outside this field, can anyone give me a sense of how close this stuff is to a kind of first-principles calculation? I'm worried a bit that this whole discussion is an exercise in curve-fitting.
Oops. The guys from last month's paper explicitly said existing simulations couldn't explain the results. Awkward.
WMAP3 simulations?! C'mon guys. We're in the Planck era already. Get some modern simulations and then come back with your argument...
The man basically said they're trying to make 50 qubit devices and that they have a working way to do flip chip to remove the readout circuitry from the qubit layer. He's an absolute madman.

As far as I understand it, the only thing you can do to one mouth that will affect the other is something that will cause the wormhole itself to close. In other words, changing the position of one mouth should not change the other mouth in any way.
undergrad very little.
grad--almost all the time
I'm in now, and the answer is definitely 'too many'. I don't think you do need a reference, though. It's however many it takes to master the material, up to the limit of however long you're awake.
BSc was 40-50 hours per week during Semester and 50-60 hours per week in the weeks leading up to the exams.

MSc was easily 60 hours per week with about 50% of the weeks being ≥70hours but I did coursework plus research from the get go, so this was not exactly how the University envisioned it. (Usually the first year of the MSc is supposed to be only coursework)
Now it's somewhere between 40 and 70 depending on schedule (especially when we have beamtime scheduled at a synchrotron the weeks before that are always very taxing).

Most PostDocs I know work at least 60 hours per week all year and will work during their holidays and weekends. No idea how their families are okay with this... also the reason why I won't continue after my PhD even though I love physics and doing research.

Edit:
I should add that this kind of workload during Bachelor and Master are not exactly necessary to do well in physics, I was among the best of the class in basically all my courses due to the time I put into learning. If you're okay even with having "just" good marks instead of near perfect scores you can reduce the workload quite a bit.
And as a final remark: this comes from someone in Germany, I have no idea how much of this is applicable to other countries.
It increases steadily as you progress. During my masters, I was easily doing 40-50 hours a week to keep up with coursework, assignments and research.
Undergrad I avoided lectures and spent the time watching anime and playing games and crammed toward the end. So like normally half an hour each day at most as a baseline and then whatever time it took to complete assignments, I didn't really 'study' except for exams, just did assessments. Worked out fine. Then again my degrees were easier than many others. Made no difference for PhD though since we have no quals. Also made no difference in research really. Hours depends on your learning style and particular courses so you shouldn't take guidelines too seriously.
Finishing my undergrad now, spend maybe 2 hours a week studying.  6 to 8 on the leadup to a test.  E&M had me studying 12 a week, but that was really the outlier.  Currently studying for the GRE and am spending 4-5 a week just on that (planning on doubling or tripling that this week because the test is in 7 days).
Rule of thumb is that you should spend as much time on your modules out of your lectures as you have timetabled. So if you have 2 hours of General Relativity a week then you should spend at least 2 hours studying it a week, but honestly I don't think that's enough, especially in the later years. I'd suggest something like 4 hours at least outside of each module...

I'm in my 4th year now so I only have 3 years of experience at uni
Currently an undergrad. I study almost non stop if you consider doing homework studying. Easily over 50 hours of homework per week. 
Many.
Doubled in math so this may skew your stats.  80% of my time was spent on math.  As the courses got harder my studying didn't change much.  In grad school I studied a bit more.  On average about three hours a day.  Five hours on Saturdays.  Took Sunday's off.  
I'm an undergrad right now and spend about 5 hours on each class per week, so 15 hours. I used to be able to get away with doing homework an hour before class and not studying freshman and sophomore years but upper level thermo/mechanics/e&m is much more involved and faster paced; missing a single lecture is a disaster. QM was overrated though, the concepts are difficult but I think the speed of instruction is slow enough that they were some of my easier classes.
I feel like it was 3-4 hours a day during the week and anywhere from 10-15 on weekends. Keep in mind that this was primarily dedicated to doing homework/projects. "Studying" in physics is mostly working problems.
In my university, Physics students are usually spending about 40 to 50 hours a week to study, read, work homework problems and digest most o the material. Of course, there is a huge jump from freshman year to junior year. 

Usually, the first class to really kick our study habits into gear is Theoretical methods for physicists I. That class was the first intense course I took in uni.
I basically study 4 hours a day I'd say... I'd love to make it 8 but I have to work... during testing periods and assignments I can easily work 12 straight hours though
Average per day may get you want you want! Example, I probably studied between 30mins - 1hr per day (not including classes). Unfortunately that was concentrated in one or two days instead of spread over the week. You hear often that cramming isn't good. Here is another data point to that.

I did my undergrad in Physics. I spent about an hour a week in the first year (mechanics, intro EM), but once we started analytical mechanics and upper div EM, I had to do about 5 hours a week to stay on top of the material. 

E: 5 hours for each class, not in total

This is like 4 years old...
Haven't atomic force microscopes been around since the 1980s? Why did it take until 2013 to take an image before and after a reaction? Or were they just not clear enough until then?
Here's a description of a related study that used the technique to [image orbitals in the the hydrogen atom](http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-first-image-ever-of-a-hydrogen-atoms-orbital-struc-509684901)  The radial peaks aren't quite as high as you'd intuitively expect from the radial probability distribution, but it's pretty impressive. 
Does this resemble what an atom would look like if we could see near-field visible light?
I'm assuming its just S.P for Sloppy Physicist? I don't think it's an actual person

I first read "While this argument is not completely ridiculous".
You waved your hands so hard it created physics.
Is this just a style thing to omit the punctuation in equations? I thought it was generally the case that you should include it. But there have been a lot of things that were prescribed to me as fact which were, in reality, a result of style.

Either way I just feel incredibly unsettled by the lack of punctuation there.
I saw a talk from the author of [this paper](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.078101), who said that he called the ponytails "fiber bundles" just to piss of mathematicians.
(Mathematician) Isn't your "zeta-regularization" actually Abel summation?  I'm pretty sure the term "zeta-regularization" only applies when there's a zeta function involved...
I remember when my Electromagnetism professor was deriving something on the board. He stopped, looked around, said "I'm checking for mathematicians" and then did some funny maths.
So... in general, are you allowed to replace a sum with the analytically continued value just because it's consistent with observation, or is there a more fundamental reason? i.e. what makes you think that function is analytic?
I'll allow it.
Cool stuff, but aren't there plenty of less dubious ways to get d=10?

For example, requiring the super-Virasoro central charge to vanish in the worldsheet SCFT gives d=10.
My favorite infinite sum is counting how many integers there are. That is,

[; S = \sum_{n =- \infty}\^{\infty} (1) ;]

Of course, since the summand is even around 0, we can just write this as

[; S = 1 + 2 \sum_{n = 1}\^{\infty} (1) ;]

And everyone knows how to do this last sum

[; \sum_{n = 1}\^{\infty} (1) = \zeta(0) = -\frac{1}{2} ;]

So we have 

[; S = 1 + 2\times\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 0 ;]

Zero. There are zero integers.

In all seriousness, Zeta regularization results in zero so often that it really is the best regulator. It's basically because it kills all of your power divergences (basically it renormalizes for you), only leaving the interesting parts of the calculation. I can't tell you how many times I've used

[; \int \frac{d\^d p}{(2 \pi)\^d} \frac{1}{(p\^2)\^{\alpha}} = 0 ;]

which "holds" for all [;d;] and [; \alpha ;], to simplify calculations.
Do you want to scare them off, or piss them off?

I've always wanted to know the name of the font used on mathematical papers. What's the name of it? I've seen it so many times in papers, exams, etc. 
Dude I've been stuck on my own thesis for the last three months because I can't satisfy myself that my explanations are clear enough. I try to explain each and every little approximation, assumption, where it comes from, who made it first, who disagrees with it, etc etc. I even dedicate a paragraph in my introduction to this process of trying to find the *Answer* and *Explanation*, when *an* answer and explanation would suffice. It's hard to draw the line and I sometimes feel like I'm drowning, and that anybody reading my thesis will just look at it and go "BAH! Look at this jackass, he doesn't even know about X!".

:(
So what is the mass of a spherical cow?
You're a monster.
I have no idea why I'm subscribed to this sub. I've never even taken physics in high school let alone gone to university. 
I'm not scared!  *stands foolishly in hero stance*
To be fair, all of that can be made completely rigorous, but physicists don't much care for that, since they already know the answer.
So there are 10 dimensions is what this is saying?

Note: I'm neither a Physicist or a mathematician, just a guy bored at work who lurks.
what's your thesis on and are you going to post it as well?
ELIFY (Explain Like I'm a first year)
I highly recommend the nicefrac package for inline fractions.
As current mathematician and former physicist, I approve this.
Regularizing divergent series is the best! Even for mathematicians :)
This is a fairly accurate representation of me reading this excerpt : http://imgur.com/P7YLKQr

Not scary at all.

I've never seen the word "insisting" used in a paper like this.

>"insisting the total ZPE is equal to -1/2 results in..."

I love it! (And hate it.)
Didn't you forget a hbar in your Hamiltonians?
Thanks for sharing. [I think most mathematicians are well aware of this sum.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww) But personally I'm much more scared by string theory's lack of physical evidence.
I feel there's a Veronica Roth joke to be made here somewhere.
srysly? thast easy shit gimme a break
Are Hamiltonians here related to graph theory? 
Is there a condensate description (dynamic possibly?) of the harmonic oscillators shifting the energy?
This isn't so horrible. I've probably read a bit more about physics than your average mathematician, but after looking up a couple of terms I can make sense of it. 
Why do you insist that the total ZPE is equal to -1/2?
So - 1/2 goes to +10?

It's back to the books with me, I guess!
Unsubscribed...
Computer Modern is ugly as hell and you should pick some other font for your thesis. Try Palatino.
The final paragraph explains how weak of an attempt this is to confirm a preexisting notion by relegating it to a mathematical aesthetic.
I studied comp-sci in uni but interested learning physics in my spare time. I need textbook that I can read front to back. Beside that I also watching MIT OCW physics, edX, berkeley webcast. Which Physics textbook for self study should I pick? 

* Physics for Scientists and engineers: A strategic approach by Knight

* University Physics with Modern Physics by Young & Freedman

* Physics for Scientist and Engineers with Modern Physics by Serway & Jewett
What's the best book to self learn upper division quantum from?  I will not have time to take it before graduating and would like to cover the material before going into grad school.  I have Griffiths and I'm not a big fan as he tends to gloss over important ideas sometimes.
I'm doing partial differential equations and spherical equations in my second year maths module (in a physics course). Any recommendations on books? 
Would have been nice to see some images from this lens array.
It's not that we're attracted to industry, it's that we're turned off of academia.  I would have attempted that track had then been more opportunities for a secure future with job hopping and hoping  for tenure
The fact is, undergraduate programs are taking on more students faster than there are academic positions.  It's not necessarily a bad thing, industry can be very interesting.  

It does hint at a bit of a problem for undergraduate programs, if you ask me.  Undergraduate programs are increasingly being seen as roadmaps to the elusive 'job', when they were designed to be roadmaps to knowledge.  Coming out of a bachelor of something does not really train you for anything specific except how to attain further knowledge, nor should it, there are a ton of great trade schools and colleges available for that sort of thing.

That being said, physics grads generally do well in industry.  They are clever, resourceful and independent.   They also generally take jobs that do not explicitly call for physicists, so it may seem that there are 'no jobs available' for physicists, when the real issue is physicists are not trained how to properly sell their skills to employers.
Resubmitted because of a misleading title.

The Joint Task Force on Undergraduate Physics released a report to help physics (presumably undergraduate) programs better prepare students for careers after graduation. Full report can be found here: http://www.compadre.org/jtupp/report.cfm

The article states "Just 5% of US physics bachelor students pursue a career as a physicist", but the article clarifies that this refers to those that become a physics professor. I don't think it includes physicists in industry or national labs.

Other highlights:

- Physics training needs to be improved to prepare physics graduates for non-physics jobs. This includes deeper knowledge of computational analysis tools, experience with applied and developmental work, and professional/workplace skills.

- 1/3 of physics Ph.D. recipients end up in academic careers. So even students planning on obtaining graduate degrees benefit from non-academic skillsets.

- Recommends that physics programs and professional societies place greater emphasis on projects and careers that are more applied and relevant to industry.
Because that seems like the most it can support. I've pretty much settled on going into the workforce instead of doing grad school assuming I get a reasonable offer.
Hey, I graduated with a BS in 2009, have not worked in the field. So I have ANY options to get into a science career?? Be brutally honest.
you need to write down a basis of the state space (which is a vector space). then you can write down any state as a linear combination of these vectors, and you can write down any operator acting on the state space as a matrix.

the rest of what you want to do then becomes linear algebra.

just an example. pauli matrices. the state space is two dimensional (over the complex numbers). choose the z  direction. take spin up as (1,0) and spin down as (0,1), then the Sx, Sy and Sz operators look like this:

Stay tuned for my nobel prize, ofc.
Conceptual breakthroughs are far harder to predict than experimental confirmations, so who the hell knows what form those will take (if I knew what they looked like I would be writing up a paper not a reddit post). But hopefully some genius will figure out quantum gravity, dark matter and/or dark energy. Perhaps they're even all related to one key misconception in our current formalisms.
After MIT's recent announcement of 2 atm Plasma pressure in their test reactor, I'm positive we'll see fusion reactors output more energy than input. It was always supposed to happen with ITER, whenever that completes, but it was a significant milestone.

One could only wish that fusion power becomes commercial and the world invests in replacing existing energy infrastructure with "free" energy (or at least the closest we can get to free on Earth).
Lots more in the realm of materials and electronics. Hopefully we can get graphene production nailed down and far better batteries, pneumatic tube transportation would be nice as well
Hopefully a successful theory for high temperature superconductivity. 
Scalable quantum computers. If they'll actually lead to anything useful is a harder question.
Footprints on Mars, hopefully.
as plaetean said one can say something about experimental discoveries but less about theoretical ones. some which come to my mind are right now: as already said maybe nuclear fusion, a lot of new materials, I guess in your lifetime string theory might be boosted or thrown away due to the discovery or lack of susi,  maybe finding out what dark matter is, further discoveries due to gravitational wave detectors, big maybe: pictures from planets of our next star from mini space ships, moon/mars city?
AI. Pay attention to the development of AI. It will change everything. 
Predicting the future is really hard. I won't even make an attempt.
Michio Kaku has some wonderful insight on possible future inventions, I suggest checking up on him.
Yes, definitely! :)
That'd be cool.

I am confused a bit. If I am understanding correctly, you're an undergrad looking to do a research project. Essentially this sounds like you'd be something along the lines of a lit review, especially in some of the mentioned fields. Also bear in mind that terms like condensed matter encompasses an incredibly wide range of topics. 

Some universities (U.S. at least) offer an actual course distinction that is called direct study or something similar that allows you focus on a project just like this while getting credit for it. 
I want to believe.
Can we rename Pluto to something else and name Planet Nine as Pluto just for nostalgia's sake?
Planets:Dad you had another kid and never told us!
Sun:¯\_(ツ)_/¯
In keeping with the Roman god theme, I think they should call it Orcus or Minerva.
Excellent question. The fact is, basically all theories *are* like this. This wasn't always understood. Einstein himself had been horribly confused about it until over a year *after* he had discovered General Relativity! (He needed a mathematician to explain this to him, actually.) People are *still* confused about it, to this day. But fewer people are. The lesson has slowly been sinking in over the last century.  

The real lesson of General Relativity is this - while other theories are actually invariant under general coordinate transformations (simply because coordinate transformations don't actually change anything except for coordinates!), General Relativity, by virtue of the fact it has a *dynamic geometry*, was the first theory to *require* a coordinate-independent formulation!
As you intuited, all sensible theories are invariant under change of coordinates.

What makes general relativity special, though, is that the mathematical formulae don't change under coordinate changes. For example, Newton's second law is

F = ma

in an inertial frame, but

F -mA = ma

for a frame with acceleration A. This means that Newton's laws, while predicting the same experimental results regardless of coordinates, can select some as preferred (based on your own notions of simplicity).

General relativity has none of that. The entire theory (the action) is constructed as to have a mathematical form that doesn't change whenever you change coordinates, and as such has no preferred frame a priori. This might seem irrelevant, but it allows spacetime to be a physical actor in its own right, which means it can evolve dynamically.
That title just got me excited
That's gonna take me a few watches as a first year college
As having just been molested by my quantum test I'm reluctant to view this haha

Hello!

I just started studying physics in germany.

Im a bit worried since its my first semester (2 weeks in) and i feel like its way too hard.

Is this normal (transition from school to university) (i had very good math and physics grades in school)

And sometimes i even doubt myself if my decision was right. :/

Anyone has tips?
I want to start applying for grad schools, but I am not a conventional student.  I have a B.A. in physics, an M.S. in another field (Environmental Science). My general GRE scores expired, but I don't know if I have to retake it since I have a Masters. I don't have all of the required physics classes, so I don't know if I am even qualified/considered.  I figure I can't get all my questions answered here, so what's a good resource to answer specific questions? Should I just call the school(s) I am interested in? 
Does anyone know anything about good research in string theory in Canada? I'll be applying for my masters soon and I'm interested in studying it. 

I've already looked at schools like UBC/McGill but I was wondering if anyone knew about any good places that may not be so obvious.

Thanks!
Do you feel like you have an impact on your field?

Do you feel like you are making significant scientific progress?

I'm super interested in physics, but I've been discouraged lately. I feel that anything less than a PhD will mean that I'll have little to no impact on whatever field I'm in and thus won't find my work fulfilling. 
Im looking for a field to go into as I am approaching junior/senior year.

I quickly found out freshman year that programming isnt necissarilly my strong suit and after working as a teachers assistant I developed a love for hands-on experimental type physics.

I really like optics because its vary hands on, but a lot of the fields I am hearing about seem very computer and programming heavy.

Thanks for taking the time to read this
Any differences between getting phd in your 20s vs 30s?
Writing samples of statements of purpose involving mental disorders

I have a mental disorder that fucked up my grades in my BSc (in some STEM course which may or may not be physics). I'm working full time and want to apply for PhD or MSc in physics. I read about advice on how to write statements of purpose for graduate school applications (not just physics. for any such as MSc, MA, PhD, MBA, law or medicine) involving mental disorders, but **I haven't seen any actual samples. Where can I find some?** If you have a disability and made a statement of purpose mentioning your disability, I would very much appreciate if you showed it to me. I would definitely keep it confidential (although you could just delete your name and change some of the dates or details or something).
Hello. 

I'm currently studying an engineering (agronomical) carreer, but i still consider I could change to another one. 
I have a feeling that maybe a lot of people have, which is: if I choose physics (which I like) as a career, I'll 'miss' not taking chemistry (mainly), and also mathematics, and computer sciences... (and add a lot of carreers, everyone maybe, philosphy goes in there as well for me). 


So, I have a question, though I don't think at all there would be an answer, but:

Is there a reason to say you'd personally say you would take physics over chemistry?
Any other physics majors want to weigh in on whether taking two physics courses simultaneously is possible?  

My college is offering Optics, QM, and Classic Mech next semester.  Optics might be really fun (it'll be a lab-based course), but I'm embarrassed by my lack of QM credentials.   Classic Mech is only offered once every three semesters, but I have time to put it off, if necessary.

Does anyone think QM + Optics is feasible?  Or might the workload be too much for a single semester.  While my non-physics courses are an absolute breeze, I'm currently grappling with staying afloat with just a single physics course this semester.
Hello, hope this isn't too late to get a response.

My undergraduate degree is in Discrete Mathematics and I am midway through a masters in Theoretical Computer Science. I have done research in Scientific Computing and would like to switch to this field (specifically Computational Physics) and finish a PhD. As you may notice, my math background is not in an area that is typically associated with physics. Does anyone here have any experience coming from a similar background and going into physics or scientific computing in general? Any advice on this and materials to fill out my mathematics knowledge would be welcome.

Thanks in advance.
Hi, this is something I've written some time ago and was wondering if it was correct to put things this way. I'd appreciate it if anyone helped point out mistakes in my understanding!
You didnt actually show anything about c1 and c2 being the probabilities to find the system is state 1 and state 2. You showed that the norm of the wavefunction is the sum of the norms of the coefficients, which must be set to 1. So c1, c2 are complex numbers lying within the unit disc. But that by itself doesn't imply anything about what c1 and c2 represent.

What you should look at are the projections of the wavefunction in the psi1 and psi2 subspaces.
Maybe I'm an idiot, but this looks like some kind of a Feynman-diagram expansion for weak coupling between the substrate and molecules. Your transition from one molecular state to another has to be mediated by the substrate.

So, you start with the eigenbasis of the molecules and to find the probability of transition from eigenstate |n> to eigenstate |m>, you sum over all the possible intermediate states, which happen to be all of the excitations of the substrate. Each of these has to be weighted by the 'propagator' for an excitation from average energy [; \epsilon ;]  to the excitation energy [; \epsilon_{s} ;] .

By that logic, summing these guys really relies on you being able to say something about [; \epsilon\_{s} ;] . In the Feynman diagrams case the energy of a free-field excitation of energy [; \epsilon\_k ;] is well-known, it's just [; k\^{\mu} k\_{\mu} ;] where [; k\_{\mu} ;] is the 4-momentum. 

So although I can't point you to an explicit reference, these kind of things should definitely be calculable for something like a substrate that's a free 2D electron gas. The propagator there is simple and this basically boils down to some tree-level Feynman diagrams, AKA some simple integrals.

EDIT: And as another idea, this sum is a kind of [Matsubara sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsubara_frequency), so if you really want to use a model where there's a discrete set of excitation energies, then you can convert this sum to some kind of integral in the complex energy plane, I bet.
Maybe a pendulum?
The idea of using motion of a thrown particle came into my mind. Would be pretty impractical and not very accurate. Like you can measure how far you throw a ball, you can take a good guess at what angle you throw it at but you can't know what force you throw it with. 
Hm, maybe measure the "fall" of objects under water? 
Know any calculus? There are some fun things you can do with limits to calculate gravity.
Very cool.  Good thinking making it do something without entering real data.
What do you mean by "pure research paper"? Your institution library should have access to most journals for you to be able to access articles.
Man reddit really needs a TeX interpreter...
p^(μ)p*_μ_* = m^(2).

p^(μ) is the four-momentum and m is the mass. The fact that four-momenta are conserved and products of them are invariant makes relativistic kinematics extremely easy. To me, this is a very nice piece of theory, but also something I use frequently in experiment. So while it's a simple equation, and obvious to most who've seen SR, it has both the "elegance" of theory and the practicality of experiment.
The Dirac Equation.

`[; i \hbar \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - m c \psi = 0 ;]`

`[; \hbar ;]` is the reduced Planck's constant, `[; \psi ;]` is a spinor wave function, a 4-component function of space and time. `[; \mu ;]` loops over space and time coordinates (using the Einstein summation convention), m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. `[; \gamma^\mu ;]` is a set of 4 complex matrices, 4x4, that obey certain algebraic relations (they anticommute). This equation applies not only to electrons but to all spin 1/2 particles. The version above is for a free particle without interactions.

By combining special relativity and quantum mechanics, Dirac was not only able to explain the spin of the electron, but also to predict half of our universe, antimatter. (Though his argument for antimatter from his equation is a little different from the current understanding, and he thought at first that the proton might be the anti-electron as the positron had yet to be discovered.)

The Schrodinger equation expresses the non-relativistic relation between energy and momentum, `[; E=p^2 / 2 m ;]`.

Dirac wanted to express the relativistic relation, `[; E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m_0^2 c^4 ;]`, where E is energy, p is momentum, m_0 rest mass, and c the speed of light.

The Klein-Gordon equation expresses this for a scalar particle.

But Dirac was looking for a linear equation. The Schrodinger equation with one side a 2nd derivative and the other a 1st derivative distinguished between space and time. Dirac looked for a way of "taking the square root" of the relativistic energy equation to give a partial differential equation involving only 1st derivatives.

One day while staring into a fireplace, the idea hit him that the only algebraic way of "taking the square root" of the relativistic energy equation was to make the wave function be a "vector" with 4 parts, multiplied by 4x4 matrix coefficients.

Depending on what one uses for the 4x4 matrices `[; \gamma ;]`, the 4 parts of the Dirac "spinor" wave function can be seen to represent an electron in spin up and spin down states, each of those either with left-handed or right-handed helicity (this is the Weyl representation). Or the 4 parts could be decomposed to electron in spin up and spin down states, versus a positron in spin up and spin down states (this is the Dirac representation).

To truly represent multiple particles one has to go through "second quantization" and work in a Fock space with creation and annihilation operators.

The weight of the world rests on this*

< T^(μ)*_μ_* > =/= 0

In scale-invariant theories, the energy-momentum tensor T^μ_ν is traceless at the classical level. However in the quantum theory the scale symmetry can be spoiled by a scale anomaly and the (expectation value) of the trace of T can be non-zero.

Classically, Yang-Mills theories such as QCD or EM would be scale invariant - this means no masses can be generated. In QCD upon quantization however a scale anomaly is developed and a preferential energy scale is selected because of quantum effects.

Hence, QCD can have massive bound states such as protons, neutrons and all the other hadrons. So literally 99% of the mass of the world is due to the fact above.

\* ok, I stole the phrase from Tong, but the enthusiasm is original.
Possibly:

S=k log(ω)

where S is the entropy, omega is the multiplicity of the system (the number of accessible microstates for a given macrostate), and k is just the Boltmann constant. I think its cool because it's such an all-encompassing equation, and strikes me as the most fundamental bit of physics that we know, so fundamental it borders on metaphysics. Whether your system is relativistic, quantum mechanical or classical, it will still obey the entropic principle.
Schrodinger's equation, namely H|ψ> = iħ∂|ψ>/∂t. It's probably a generic equation, but it's my favorite anyway.

H is the Hamiltonian, an operator which encodes the dynamics of a physical system. Its eigenvalues are possible energies a system can take, and its eigenstates are stationary states.

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and quantifies how much energy a quantum of radiation carries, viz. E=hf where ħ=h/(2π).

t is time.

|ψ> is a point in Hilbert space which represents the state of a physical system.

Schrodinger's equation describes how a closed system's state will evolve in time. The Hamiltonian, which classically corresponds to the energy of a system, generates time evolution. A state with a sharply-determined energy will not evolve; evolution occurs due to the phases between different energy eigenstates in a superposition changing at different rates.

It's my favorite equation because it lies at the foundation of quantum mechanics, and because it's so beautifully simple and compact.
I'm partial to Fermi's Golden Rule, especially in Bra-Ket notation:

I = |< f | E | i >|^2

where I is the intensity of your signal, E is the excitation operator of whatever excitation source you're using and | f > and | i > are the final and initial states of your syste, respectively.

Basically, this equation allows you to find relationships between the intensity you measure ( I ), the exciation probe you use ( E, typically photons or electrons but it basically accepts anything) and the quantum-mechanical propperties of your system given by | i > and | f >
Noether's Theorem. [I'm legit reading about a stochastic version now.](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_13.html). It's a more fundamental principle where all of the known "physical laws" can be derived.
It may be slightly cheating to say Maxwell's equations (not that much since you can express them as a single Tensor equation, but I'm not massively thrilled by that representation), but when written in differential form (in Gaussian units), they represent the simple ways in which fields and EM phenomena arise, and they just have so much meaningful Symmetry and Antisymmetry. They're also very pretty to write out and not too hard to explain to the layman.

Another favorite is generalized Stokes' Thm, for similar reasons and also the connections between it and Maxwell's Equations in particular.
I love the Euler-Lagrange equation, but I'm far too displaced to correctly remember the reason why I started to love it.
c^2 = 1/(µ_0*ε_0)

Where c is the speed of light, µ_0 is the magnetic permeability, and ε_0 is the electric permeability.

I remember when my teacher derived this equation out of the standard wave equation. It's simple and beautiful if you ask me.
PV=nRT
P=pressure
V=volume
n= mol
R=universal gas constant
T= temperature

The ideal gas equation.
Showing the relationship between the variables of an ideal gas. I just love everything we can derive from this.
e^{i\pi }+1=0 aka Euler's Identity

where

e is Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms,

i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i2 = −1, and

π is pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. 
This one is the General solution to electro static potentals wirh dirichlet boundary conditions. This the NOT my favorite equation, because I love all equally. Anyways, here it is.

Φ(x) = (1/4 ε0 π)∬(ρ(x')*G(x,x')*dV') -(1/4 π)∮(∇'G(x,x')●nhat*Φ(x')*dS')

Φ is the potential
ε0 is the electronic permetivity in a vacuum
integrate over some volme wrt to x'
ρ(x') is the charge density at x'
G(x,x') is the approptiate Green's Function (I will explain this later)
dV' is the differential volume
∇'G(x,x') gradient wrt x' of our Green's Function
● dot product
nhat is the surface normal vector of our volume.
dS' is the surface area element wrt to x'

I like this one because I grew to love it. It ia so use to find any/most electric potential(with dirichlet boundary conditions!) as long as you have an appropriate Greens function.

What is this Green's Function? In electrostatics we often ask the question: how does some object be it a conduct, insulator, or somewhere between react if we place a charge at some point around it. The Green's function answers this and we cam then find the electric potential and thus the electric fields.
fin.


I don't think I have a single favorite, but one I haven't seen mentioned here so far is [Stokes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem),

    [; \int_{\partial\Omega}\omega = \int_{\Omega}\mathrm{d}\omega ;]

Here `[; \omega ;]` is a differential form - basically, a function of space, but more general - and `[; \Omega ;]` is a region in that space. The theorem relates an integral over a region to an integral over the boundary of that region. I always thought the fact that such a relationship exists was kind of wild, even though in principle it's really easy to understand.
The semi-empirical binding energy formula:

    [; E_B = a_V A - a_S A^{\frac{2}{3}} - a_C \frac{Z^2}{A^{\frac{1}{3}}} - a_A \frac{(A - 2 Z)^2}{A} \pm \delta(A,Z) ;]

It always makes me laugh when I see it (which I pretty much never do). 
As the usual candidate (and winner) of this kind of threads is already here (and winning), I'll go with something more practicable and fun:

The [Tsiolkovsky rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation)

**The equation**

Δv = v*_e_* ln(m*_0_* / m*_f_*)

**The parameters**

* Δv  is the maximum change of velocity of the vehicle (with no external forces acting).
* m*_0_* is the initial total mass, including propellant.
* m*_f_* is the final total mass without propellant, also known as dry mass.
* v*_e_* is the effective exhaust velocity.

**The meaning**

The rocket equation captures the essentials of rocket flight physics in a single short equation.  
It also holds true for rocket-like reaction vehicles whenever the effective exhaust velocity is constant, and can be summed or integrated when the effective exhaust velocity varies.  
In what has been called "the tyranny of the rocket equation", there is a limit to the amount of payload that the airship can carry, as higher amounts of propellant increment the overall weight, and thus also increase the fuel consumption.

**The reason**

Rockets -> [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com) -> Awesome!
there are bilions, the first one wich popped into my mind is

x_{n+1} = 1/2 * ( x_n + a / x_n )

which is an algorithm for calculating the square root of a real number a. you make an initial guess x_1 and then proceed calculating iteratively x_2, x_3, ecc.

i love this particular method for 2 reasons: it converges like a slavic prostitute (extremely fast, try it!) and is an ancient formula, i.e. shows ancient people were not as stupid as we think.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method


I'm a big fan of the generalised gauss' law

Int_\Omega (d \omega) = Int_{di \Omega} \omega

Mathematically this relates the exterior derivative of a form in a volume to the value on the boundary of the volume.  The reason it's my favourite is because it relates so many branches of physics.

It gives half of maxwells equations, re-expresses noethers theorem, and generalises Euler-Lagrange equations with a boundary.  What is great about it is how elegant and useful it is at the same time.  It also works in any number of dimensions.

Edit:  Here's a wiki link to learn more.  I made a mistake earlier.  I meant Gauss' theorem (not law) and even that is wrong since mathematicians call the generalised version stokes theorem.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes'_theorem
The Schwarzschild Radius equation is a personal favorite of mine. I'm a physics noob so I'll list the simplified(?) version.  
r_sub_s = (2Gm)/(c^2)  
G and c are the gravitational constant and the speed of light respectively.  
just plug in your mass and you get the radius of the event horizon of that mass, assuming uniform circular non rotating etc.  
also Wikipedia says this is the Newtonian version of the equation, like i said I'm a physics noob.
Y=mx+b
[Maxwell's equations](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/7/5d747696e1453e4d1eb657317ebbf12f.png):

sum_(j from 0 to 3) d/dx^j  F^(jk) = mu_0 J^k

x^0 = t, x^1 = x, x^2 = y, x^3 = z (Einstein notation)

F^jk is the electromagnetic tensor, which looks like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/5/6/3565a130bf3698dac0a31081a14012d4.png) (E and B are the electric and magnetic fields)

mu_0 is the permeability of free space (a constant)

J^k is the current (4-vector, where J^0 is the charge and J^1 = J_x, J^2 = J_y and J^3 = J_z)

Maxwell's equations are very useful in determining how electromagnetic fields work. This particular representation is in the presence of electric charge and current (ie not free-space, aka inhomogeneous)

I like this one as it's actually very small, but with knowledge of Einstein notation and the electromagnetic tensor it conveys all the electromagnetic information in the absence of silly complications like propagation through matter
Uh... hwo dare you call newtons second law "boring". F=ma is one of the most important laws of motion and helps us understand rate of change in moving bodies. 

The fact that it all comes together as neatly it does is also amazing to me.

Don't underestimate it's simplicity. 
The integral t squared dt

From one to the cube root of three

Times the cosine

Of three pi over nine

Is the log of the cube root of e!
It's a pair of equations:

dF=0
δF=j

Is the covariant form of Maxwell's equations. I loved working through so much math, to get such simple equations, which explain so much. Almost everything you see in your day to day life is explained entirely, or in part, by these simple equations. 

F is the electromagnetic field strength tensor (a 2-form) and j is the 4 dimensional charge current. 
Everyone know this eqution, but let's follow the rules.

[Continuity equation](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c4f41ca816e5db767c9260a64f03da64f3762111)

where rho is a number density of some quantity, j is a flux, sigma is  a source term and t is time.

The equation describes the transport of some quantity (mass, energy, charge, number density etc.) and can be found in almost every area of physics, from classical mechanics to relativity. It is quite important for me, since I often use it in glow discharge modeling.

However, it is not unusual, so no bonus points.
This is cheating because it's a definition not an equation. You'll have to forgive me because my Masters is in Informatics rather than a real science. 

Anyway, the definition of information is: a difference that makes a difference. 

It's a powerful definition because it covers an extremely complex concept whist being incredibly concise at the same time. 
Riemann Integral, or the sum of an infinite number of rectangles underneath a curve. 

    [; \int_a^b F(x)dx = ^{lim}_{n\rightarrow \infty } \sum^{n}_{i=1} F(x_{i-1})\Delta x ;]

It was the first piece of calculus that really made me stop and realize that I was in big-boy math now. 
My favorite equation has to be Ohms law where I=V/R. I find this equation to be so simple yet an important one for anyone who studies electricity. 

For those who do not know I is the current(amps), v is the voltage and r is the resistance.

F=Gm1m2/r^2

Beautiful, simple, revolutionary! 
emf = -NΦB/Δt

This is known as Faraday’s law of induction. Here, emf is the electromotive force, N is the number of loops in a coil, ΦB is the magnetic flux and delta t is the change in time. The units of emf is Volts.

It predicts how a magnetic field interacts with an electric circuit.

I love it because I'm learning it right now and it makes sense to me..first time anything with a 'wierd symbol' made sense to me and restarted my interest in physics!
[;lim_{N\shortrightarrow\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \alpha ^{n} = \frac{1}{1-\alpha}, |\alpha| < 1;]

It isn't physics so much as math, but it can be used to show that 0.9+0.09+0.009+... = 1.

Also sorry if it doesn't format right, I'm on mobile.
One of my personal favourites is 

`f=c×2^p`

Where `f` is the frequency of a sound and `p` is its pitch (dimensionless, in octaves). `c` is a tuning constant (more on that below). 

It's interesting as it defines pitch as the binary logarithm of frequency, relative to a constant. Specifically, it describes *equal temperament* pitch. There is much debate in music about tuning systems, and I love this equation for its elegance and ability to describe pitch purely logarithmically and without requiring traditional musical notation. 

Traditionally, western tuning has defined `c`, here representing the note C, to be exactly equal to 27.5×2^(-9/12). However it can be any positive frequency. [Philosophical pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch) is when `c` is equal 16, such that every C note is a power of 2. One could also set `c` to 1, leading to the extremely elegant `f=2^p`. This only differs from philosophical pitch in that the octave numbering would be different. One could also set `c` to 27.5 exactly and increment the octave numbering at A as opposed to C. 
I’d say the Einstein-Hilbert action, S ∝ ∫R dvol.  Even though the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are some non-linear hell, the
action is incredible simple.

R = scalar curvature, dvol = Riemannian volume measure
Dirac, just for the epiphany moment
Just me who understands absolutely 0 of this?
Euler's Identity.  While I still don't quite grasp the implications, I think it's awesome that two seemingly independent numbers are some how connected.
F - R = ma
i^i \elem\R

Apparently this needs explaining. I is the member such that if you square it you get -1, \R is the set of all real numbers. \elem means is an element of. It's cool because it's not intuitive but it's simple to prove. Cool, huh? Did I sate the down voters of the sub? 
The heat of the meat is directly proportional to the cross products of the torque of the pork and the speed of the deed by the angle of the dangle
The uncertainty principle. It proves that our lives are not deterministic, which is both liberating and terrifying.
It sounds like you're interested in quite a broad area of physics research. As long as you know you would be happy doing anything within that area, then I would focus on the supervisor/group that you will apply to. The fit between yourself and a group is massively important as is the fit for you in a city or institution. Start looking into what groups are out there and seeing if you can set up some interviews or phone calls. These will give you a good feel for how certain groups work. Some important things to look at are publications and travel. It looks good when a professor is constantly doing talks external to their institution however this is mostly bad for you as their student because it might be difficult to reach them. In terms of publications, make sure the professor doesn't just piggy back onto the papers of their students, it's important for funding, and the future prestige of the group, that they're driving their own research too. Look for students being independent within a group and publishing papers with few authors.
One thing that you'll probably learn is that fields of study themselves are very very broad, and within each you can find some topic that you're interested in. Don't look too hard at what looks cool right now, because the deeper you go they might not stay that cool. 

I think the most important thing is to find a good supervisor. Doing the most interesting work can be miserable if you hate the people you're working with.
Statistics is so important in grad school, and regardless of what you choose to study you'll be publishing on the back of a statistician if you can't do that stuff by yourself.
Skip grad school for now if you actually want a future. If you aren't balls to the walls about academia, it's a shit show with very little funding, very little opportunity for advancement, and practically zero incentive.  I think work that is done in academia is great, but you literally have to kill yourself for decades to get to that point. If you were super passionate about something, then this would be a different story, but if you're waffling, go see if you like industry because in the worst case you make more money now than you would after 7 years of grad school and you still have the opportunity to go back. 
From my own experience and from that of my colleagues is that a lot of it depends on where you fall into things. What your advisor does, and so on.

I think that the most important thing when choosing an advisor and deciding what to work on is to remember that you can change your mind. Of course, you don't want to do this all the time, but it is much better to change now rather than wait a few years and see if it does better. Look at what the postdocs and faculty are working on, and decide if that is a path that you are interested in following.
Thank you to all of you for taking time out of your day to respond. I feel most inclined at the moment to work in the gravitational physics field and I am considering my options for potential PhD groups. I think this might be right for me.

I have one last question for r/Physics. Should I consider perhaps starting a Masters program such that I familiarize myself with some of the more rigorous topics before beginning a PhD? I may be able to decide with more confidence where my interests really lie if I'm faced with some of these fields. Were there any resources, books etc. that helped you to choose the right PhD program for you? 
That's ok! I don't think you should focus on specializing just yet. You're still an undergrad, and I don't agree with current norms that you should decide your field at the age of 21. Go out and explore a bit before you make a decision about study areas!
Learn as much as you can about everything now.  When you go to grad school, interview with a ton of groups in a wide distribution of sub fields.  Pick the one with which you feel the most camaraderie.  There are tons of interesting problems, but good research communities are harder to come by.  Having a very broad background will help you in any specialty.
Not a physicist but someone with a wide range of interests and multiple graduate degrees. You may never find one area if you just love to learn. That said, for me, one of the easiest ways to know if you are following the right path is how happy you are discussing it. If you just burst with excitement at the possibilities of the research and feel the need to tell everyone about every detail that you learned or are discovering, then that's a great area for you. 

Separate "wow this is interesting" from "this is freaking amazing stuff!!! How am I ever going to NOT think about this!?"
I don't think there's any such thing as a paper _every_ physicist should read. Certainly there are concepts every physicist should be familiar with, but that's what classes are for. The research papers are often not the best way to learn these things.

Shoutout to everyone providing links in this thread.
There are a lot of articles in the american journal of physics, which is a journal dedicated to educational aspects of physics. I remember reading one showing how rapidity naturally arises in special relativity starting with the lorentz group.
1. [Suggestions on giving talks](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9703019). Like it or not, we have to present our work. Fortunately giving a good technical talk is a skill you can learn.

2. If you're interested in learning some gravity/general relativity, I recommend all the papers in the [GR Milestones](http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0264-9381/page/Focus%20issue%20on%20Milestones%20of%20general%20relativity) issue of CQG. Some great, readable, summaries of important research in the field.

3. [Living Reviews](http://www.livingreviews.org/) is an excellent place to learn a ton from the ground up. These papers are big, comprehensive, free, and accessible.

4. I'm biased since this is my field, but I recommend the [first LIGO detection paper.](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102) Make no mistake, this is a huge milestone and the PRL paper is pretty readable.

5. Since you're into cosmology: [The Universe is an Inside Out Star](https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4335). Yes it's an April fool's joke. But it's actually an excellent educational piece. Describes the basic idea of measurements of the cosmic microwave background.

I would say there are some other papers worth reading in original form (like Dirac's monopole string paper), but this is the one that comes to mind for me in cosmology.
einstein's 1905 papers. dirac's paper on the magnetic monopole. he gives an introduction about his thoughts on creating new physics, and this paper is a good example of fleshing out a "what if?" freeman dyson's paper that goes over feynman's proof of maxwell's equation. also a good example of a physicist employing techniques looking for new physics.

Thanks for asking this question and thanks to the many who are providing such excellent references. I think I've learned more from the answers here than from just about any other physics subreddit thread I've read.
This is very exotic, but the most interesting paper I ever read was [Life at Low Reynolds Numbers](http://jilawww.colorado.edu/perkinsgroup/Purcell_life_at_low_reynolds_number.pdf) by Purcell (known from the Purcell effect). It's a birthday talk that was subsequently transcribed and published, so it has a very different tone to it.

It's about the movement of small things in fluids. At small scales, water feels lick thick honey, so the usual macroscopic swimming motions are useless, because you move as if you have no intertia. From this he goes on about the swimming techniques of bacterias and how it helps them get nutrients.
The one's contained in *On the Shoulders of Giants*, *The Dreams That Stuff Is Made Of* and *God Created The Integers*. All of the essays are compiled by Stephen Hawking.


 Electrical engineering rarely involves understanding what the electrons are actually doing, and it's actually kind of tough to make the conceptual jump between the fundamental physics and the common abstractions (resistors, transistors, voltage sources, etc) that are actually used in engineering.

I personally don't think it's useful to make that connection. It may be satisfying intellectually, but it won't help you solve electrical engineering problems more easily.
One of the best ways to understand circuitry is the water analogy, imagine the conductor is a pipe with water (electricity) flowing through it. 

Amperage: flow rate

Voltage: pressure

Resistance: diameter of pipe 

Now this analogy doesn't explain everything but it helps get a grasp of the concept of how electricity flows. 
Sorry, I don't really know of any good circuits books. But electrical potential and voltage are essentially the same thing; voltage drop is just the difference in electrical potential between two points (e.g. between the terminals of a circuit element).

I'm not sure exactly what a typical biomechanics course covers. Google seems to show a fair amount of variety, with some courses seeming fairly close to a first-semester physics course and others a bit farther off. (Of course even the barest introduction to the subject is more of a foundation than many Physics 101 students have.) Do you have a course syllabus or something like that?

The physics horror stories seem overblown to me, but then I would say that, wouldn't I?

Listen, folks, something is going on, okay?  The Crooked Hillary Clinton campaign doesn't want to talk about it, but something is going on with the rotation of galaxies.  So they're saying maybe like 80% of matter is dark, but actually if you listen to the really smart people the real number is more like 95% dark, okay?  My uncle was a professor at MIT and - and I went to Wharton, so like good smart genes, right?  You don't build, like, really beautiful, tremendous buildings without good genes, right?  But my uncle would say nuclear is the big one.  After nuclear it's all over, folks.  And you've got this weak Barack Obama "presidency" that just let's that maniac in North Korea have all the nukes he wants.  A shame.  Such a shame.  Such an unbelievable shame.  But also you kind of have to respect him in North Korea because he took out all the generals who weren't for him and stayed with the power this whole time.  You gotta kind of respect that, in a way, because that's the sort of thing not everybody can, like, do.  But my uncle would say nuclear is the whole game, but now you've got all this dark matter and it's 95% of matter that isn't even with the nuclear and our country's very stupid representatives don't even know what it is.  We let 95% of matter into this country and we don't even know what it is or where it comes from.  People say axions and they say, like, WIMPs, but the only wimps are the wimps in the totally rigged and biased media who never report on Crooked Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails!

edit: fuck it gotta add some Feynman, [Los Alamos from Below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY-u1qyRM5w) is one of the most entertaining hours of audio you'll listen to.
I enjoyed the wit and historical background from this interview of early cosmologist Dennis Sciama - who supervised the PhD work of Stephen Hawking, Martin Rees, George Ellis and others - that I briefly reviewed in this cosmology subreddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmology/comments/4yfje9/interview_with_dennis_sciama_nice_read_on_the/

Especially note point 2, about his meeting with Einstein and how as a nervous young professor feeling intimidated before the great scientist, Sciama used some very clever humor to break the ice.

My bro works in a prison as a correctional officer, and recently they installed a machine that uses x-rays to see if the prisoners have anything they shouldn't have instead of making them strip, and he wants to know if he should be worried if he's going to be the guy who sits next to it for 8 hours.
Would love to get a reality check on this [new process for converting CO2 to ethanol](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/green-tech/a23417/convert-co2-into-ethanol/).
When I stick a pole into putty the putty swirls up the pole instead of just around it. What causes it to do this? The best I can guess is that your basically, because the top of the putty is affected by the rotation more than the bottom, the top is pulled over the bottom stacking it and then the next layer is stacked and so on, this would also account for why the layers get thinner towards the top. Am I in the ballpark here? Please explain.
Several science educators use pressure and valving / aperture-size to explain why blowing on your hand with pursed lips is cooler than the hot breath of your open mouth.

Here's [one example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S88XeA6fbM) and [another](https://youtu.be/Kcj4TAvKxq8?t=27m46s).

While there might be *some* pressure and expansion, isn't it relatively nominal?  Just a few PSI difference from the hot breath!  Is any serious compression occurring in the mouth to drive any significant expansion?

Isn't the Joule-Thomson effect typically nominal (maybe imperceptible?) until truly high pressure (or massive amounts of gas, as in weather patterns, where small differences add up)?

**Isn't the cooling felt on the hand *more* attributable to other mechanisms?**  If so, which ones explain the demo *better* than Joule-Thomson?  If not, how is the Joule-Thomson effect *more* responsible for the temperature difference than entrained ambient air, evaporative cooling, and forced convective cooling... what is the percent impact of JT over those other effects?

[This explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFMTbx4GyUY) (entrained ambient air) seems closer to the truth (but doesn't exactly nail the Bernoulli effect's relevance, which is another series of [mislead classroom demos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle#Misapplications_of_Bernoulli.27s_principle_in_common_classroom_demonstrations)).
Is there a numerical estimate for the total entropy of the universe?
lets say i have a long pole with rounded ends and i balance it perfectly on its end. if i push it, it will fall over. if i try stand it up but put it at a slight angle, it will fall over. the smaller the angle is, the longer it will take to fall over - it will accelerate slower. in theory, i could balance it so that the acceleration is really really slow so it would look as if it was standing still for a long time before falling over with seemingly no outside input. 

theoretically, i could have the pole standing up for years before falling over with no external action. however, this seems to really go against my inbuilt sense of physics - it just doesnt seem right. is this possible? could i balance a pole that will fall over in 30,000 years?
Hah, we played this in my intro physics labs if we finished before time was up.
interesting how much it looks like the 2D space plane is simply tilting in 3D, as if linear acceleration in 3D is just rotation in 4D...
relatively easy?
Some of those levels were tricky!  Very fun.

I always thought (special) relativity was easy to understand anyway (I wouldn't think of saying the same of general), but ... this is a really fun game.
So if I understand this correctly, as I'm getting closer to the speed of light, the world (in direction of my movement) shrinks more and more? And at c it would become pointlike, which is not physically meaningful, therefore impossible?
And you can't shrink beyond zero, so getting faster than c is therefore impossible?

I didn't realize that 5 year olds were trying to learn relativity.

If this is meant for adults, good god, what is that saying about people today?
Are you a teacher or a student?

If the student is as bright as you make him sound, then my guess is that he failed simply because he did not do the homework. Sadly, I've seen a number of bright students fail for this reason. You see this a lot in lower level classes. (I'm guessing that physics 221 is a freshman or sophomore level course?)
Why the actual fuck do you think that people on the internet with no context or data could answer this?
Asking questions in class is one thing, but going home and grinding out solutions to all the hard problems is another.
This has become a pattern recently: No one here knows what 'physics 221' is.

If this is a student in your class then surely you can see where he lost his marks by simply looking at his record?
Depends What you mean by 'average intelligence'. 

It used to be the case that people with average intelligence would seriously struggle to make it through undergrad with ~10% of the population going through uni at all (in the UK at least). Now it seems that a much larger proportion of the population can achieve a university degree, but then again some of those degrees are in things like "BA (Hons) Adventure and Outdoor Management", Which really are a lot easier than a degree in physics.

https://www.solent.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/adventure-and-outdoor-management-ba

I would say if someone makes it through undergrad physics with reasonably good grades they could probably put out a passable thesis. But I would also say that if they can do that they are probably above average intelligence. 

Also, time is a factor. I know smart (I would consider above average intelligence) people who have left without a PhD because they ran out of time (their sholarships expired) and had to withdraw or pay huge fees.

It also depends a little on whether you mean an experimental or theoretical PhD. I may get shouted down for this but I can imagine a weak experimental student scraping through by spending loads of time in the lab, I can't see how more time helps you as a theorist if you can't understand the relevant concepts. Obvious bias (I am a theorist). 
[nature study on smart children](http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-raise-a-genius-lessons-from-a-45-year-study-of-super-smart-children-1.20537)

1. Results contradict long-established ideas that expert performance is built mainly through practice

2. Spatial ability plays a major part in creativity and technical innovation and it's generally overlooked in school-based assessments

3. Grade-skippers were 60% more likely to earn doctorates or patents and more than twice as likely to get a PhD in a STEM field

4. German Studies on 26,000 gifted students in the mid-1980s found that cognitive factors were the most predictive, but that some personal traits — such as motivation, curiosity and ability to cope with stress — had a limited influence on performance. Environmental factors, such as family, school and peers, also had an impact.

5. For individuals beyond a certain IQ barrier (120 is often cited), concentrated practice time is much more important than additional intellectual abilities in acquiring expertise.

Even if you are not one of those kind of persons, you can still do it and plenty of people actually do.
This is Richard Feynman, one of the greatest physicists and the jesus of physics for many people

People on /r/Physics don't have the expertise required to answer this question meaningfully.
I'm gonna have to be the party pooper and say probably not, if by "average intelligence" you literally mean 100 IQ.

The thing is - people live in bubbles. If you're an IQ 130 person, you probably have no close friends who are of 100 IQ. What the typical high IQ person thinks of as "average" IQ is, in fact, very far above average. Frankly, unless you work in a profession like psychological sciences or psychiatry that actually enables you to know people's IQs, it's very difficult to get a real feel for just what 70 IQ, 100 IQ, 130 IQ actually mean.


In terms of hard numbers, the average IQ of someone completing an undergraduate degree is ~115-120, and the average IQ of someone getting a PhD is 125-130 with SUBSTANTIAL variation between fields (physics and math PhDs tend to be higher IQ than the average PhD recipient). What's more, if you bother to divide IQ scores into specific subsections (e.g. verbal/mathematical), math/physics PhDs tend to be lopsided. Which is to say, their raw mathematical IQ is even higher above normal than a lump IQ score would indicate.


What does this mean? It means if you REALLY take someone who is truly at the population average of mathematical intelligence and stick them in a physics PhD program, they will be MULTIPLE STANDARD DEVIATIONS below the AVERAGE LEVEL of their peers.

Again, if you don't frequently work with a diverse IQ population, it's hard to get a feel for what this means. But let me tell you: it means a lot.


And in particular, it means even more when you consider BEYOND the PhD. Could someone who is untalented in mathematics obtain a math PhD through sheer, brute determination? Maybe, but maybe not. Are they likely to obtain very much success as a mathematician, even applying the same brute determination? Maybe, but maybe not... and certainly favoring the maybe not more than the prior question.


My point being, just because someone could, doesn't mean they should. I could not ethically recommend becoming a physics PhD to someone who is genuinely average, at a population level, in intelligence for the same reason I would not recommend someone who is hard of hearing become a concert musician. Even if it's possible, it would be extremely difficult, and one has to wonder to what extent someone who can not hear would really enjoy being a musician, and to what extent someone with no mathematical talent or spatial ability whatsoever would enjoy being a physicist.


THAT SAID - I want to reemphasize that what you consider "average" might, in fact, be very far above average. Look up imposter syndrome. Oftentimes the very best, most talented people on the ENTIRE PLANET believe they are only average, or only below average. I doubt you're really as average as you think you are (assuming you're asking for yourself). You are almost certainly more talented than you think.
Yes.
It's quite possible. 

OTOH, getting a Ph.D. isn't like getting a Nobel Prize or a tenured professorship. If you grind away at it hard enough in the right situation, you'll get a Ph.D. But it might not be at a great institution from a great advisor with a great career path ahead of you. It's hard even for smart people. Even very smart Ph.D.s from top programs often end up disillusioned and on career paths that don't involve physics. 

That said, compared to an undergraduate physics major it probably isn't going to get any easier. At least part of the Ph.D. is going to require passing a general exam. 
I won't simply answer with a Yes or No because your question leaves no room for interpretation. Intelligence is a broad terms which covers many areas, for PhD in physics you need to have good visualization skills to understand complex systems and their interactive behavior. Also you must have a good memory so to retain what you have learn.

I say you should have good understanding skills and grasping power if you want to get a PhD in any field, hard work can get you through some tight space but there are only 24 hours in a day and you can't work like a machine to get better results. So plan your schedule and you would do ok.
I think a lot of people overestimate the 'average intelligence' level. Most HS students of average intelligence have poor spatial reasoning and abstract thinking skills. These are critical components to passing introductory physics, let alone upper level or graduate work. 

Many average HS students can't visualize the magnetic field around a long straight wire pointing in various directions. Not sure how they could be expected to understand a vector field and further calculate the div, grad, curl, etc. 

Plenty of average students can't accurately follow the directions in their HS chemistry class, but somehow they're going to design and conduct the independent research needed to write a dissertation?

There's a reason that 'quantum mechanics' is used so often in woo; it's a very difficult concept that isn't understood by the majority of people, so they treat it as 'magic in the real world' that can explain anything. 

Could a person of average intelligence earn a PhD in physics? Perhaps, but I find it very unlikely. If they were groomed from a very early age, they might have a shot. If you take a random, motivated, HS graduate of average intelligence and put them in a PhD track, they're not going to make it. 
The world doesn't operate in extremes. *Can* an average person become a physicist? Sure. Is it likely? Nope.

Physics is hard for smart people. What in the fuck is it for normal people?
Yes, certainly. The GRE test is the perfect illustrator of this. The GRE is designed to predict grad school performance, so it was validated by comparing GRE scores to graduation rates. The GRE is also highly correlated with IQ, like most standardized exams.

The result is that, for people who score in the middle 80th percentile, there is no correlation between GRE score, intelligence, and graduation likelihood. It does a reasonably good job at predicting the obvious, namely that very smart people are more likely to get a PHD than very dumb people.

If you get anything over 10th percentile on the GRE then you should go to grad school if you want to.
Depends on your affinity for mathematics. Sometimes people who are good at it take it for granted that anybody can do it. I personally made it through second semester Calculus with, I think, a decent understanding but after that I was lost. But, by no means should you let your perception of your intelligence, whatever it is, dissuade you from trying, if that is what you want to do. 
I know lots of people with PhD's in physics that are pretty stupid.  In may institutions, it's not the intelligence, it's the stick-to-it-vnese that pays off.
I'm average, graduated middle of my class in undergrad, always having a hard time keeping up, but I got into a PhD Program! Its been tough, but I love it! My peers in grad school are much further ahead of my in physics, but here I am chuggin along
Yes. I'm doing it right now
Absolutely they can. Getting through Physics is just a matter of putting in the time. Let's say you read through a textbook chapter and don't understand any of it. So you read it again and still don't understand it. You're going to get frustrated and want to quit. Well here's what makes the difference: Are you willing to read it again and again, taking handwritten notes each time, and consulting alternative textbooks and online resources until it *does* make sense? Are you willing to give up your nights and weekends mastering the material? If the answer is yes, then you can get a PhD. Being smart helps but isn't the real determining factor.
I would love, more than most things I can think of, to learn Physics but I'm inept when it comes to mathematics. What hope for me? 
In my experience, there is a cut off wherein increasing intelligence has little effect on your success as a researcher. Below that intelligence cut off, graduate students really struggle because they tend to ask the wrong research questions. They spend time on unnecessary experiments, design experiments poorly and misinterpret results. The students above that threshold seem to have success that is much more closely tied to their work ethic than intelligence level. 

The first student to graduate from my cohort did it in about 3.5 years because she was just good at getting shit done. She was at the lower end of intelligence out of our class based on course work and other intelligence indicators, but she was intelligent enough. 

As for your original question, I'm not sure if "average intelligence" is enough or not. Physics is probably one of the most intellectually demanding fields to work in. In other doctoral degrees, I think that intelligence threshold drops a bit (full disclosure, I'm a chemistry guy who somehow got into a physics intensive dissertation project).
I consider myself to be of average intelligence. I think anyone can learn material with enough work, it's the original research part that would prevent someone like me from that last step. Working hard to learn material is possible, coming up with original research is another story. 
Definitely yes.
I should perhaps have qualified my statement by being clearer in that, when I asked 'what hope for me', it was a mere statement and not an invitation to ask what my chances were!

Thanks all the same.
It is hard already to get a bachelor degree, so you can imagine how hard  phd would be, hard like med school level
I'm assuming you are asking this question at the end of a bachelor or masters level physics degree. If you were able to get through that with enough marks to enter a PhD program then you are smart enough.

If Ben Carson can become a neurosurgeon then you can become a physics PhD.
I'll get mine in a some months and from my personal experience (myself) I'd say definitely someone of average intelligence can.

It takes a lot of hard work and long hours when need be but as long as you have a supervisor you like working with and a nice group and you enjoy the physics you're studying then you'll be fine. Those are far more important than grades. I've seen people with bad grades do great and poor grades hate it and quit. It's not really about intelligence at that level because it becomes a job and a life - not just a degree or qualification, don't do it for that reason.

A small corollary is that this applies to experiences I've had / know about in Europe - I think this may not be the case in the US where the work-life balance is more skewed from what I've heard.
Too much is made in this thread about mathematical sophistication and studying physics.  There certainly is a ceiling binding mathematical abilities but it's really high.  Real intellectual quality entails putting down ideas in mathematical form, interpreting mathematical equations on physical terms, understanding when to approximate and when to power for the exact solution, etc.

But the above skills aren't based on being able to solve complicated equations or manipulating them.  They are based on imagination and logic.  For example, if one understands when to use a Hamiltonian vs. a Lagrangian, then one understands the nature of the problem.  

If by "average intelligence" you mean a person with an IQ of 100 (which is the IQ value of an average person by definition), it is *highly* doubtful that such a person can get a PhD in physics no matter how hard they work.
This is clearly a question causing a lot of debate. I'll throw my two cents in and say yes, I truly believe that anyone can make a PhD level contribution in physics given they are of 'average intelligence'. That's a pretty nebulous term, so I won't try to define it too much, especially not with IQ which is not a well founded concept either.  
From experience, I believe that the biggest factor in learning physics is a persons ability to explain things to themselves. You don't need to be able to visualize the thing, you don't need to be able to look at the equations and just 'get' them, you don't need to be able to do any of it! The thing you need to do, the ONLY thing you need to be able to do, is explain the concepts to yourself and be able to translate them into the common language of mathematics. For some people, that IS picturing it, or seeing the equations and understanding, or some other method. The problem for a lot of people is they never develop a consistent way to explain things to themselves.  
If you want to know how to get a PhD in physics, I would say first find within yourself the motivation for it and second figure out HOW to learn. If you have motivation and an rock-solid understanding of how you personally learn, you can manage it. These are two things that can each take years to develop, however. A lot of people get to the point where they recognize the material and think they a mastered it. When it comes time to use it, they don't understand why they can't pull it out of memory. Some people never go through the trouble to really organize the facts in their minds, and then they can't relate the concepts to each other and it's just a list of formulas in their head.  
I think there is innate intelligence. But I think the thing that far outstrips it is an ability to learn, and to learn efficiently. I almost failed algebra the first time I took it. Then I became interested in physics, and did extremely well in the class because I was reading it for interest and ticked myself into learning the material in a way I couldn't by sitting down and copying formulas. From that, I developed a way to learn and then could move forward.  
There is an elitism in 'difficult' professions, this idea that we've made it somewhere because we've got these minds that are just perfect for it. Those people exist, but they are the rarest kind of person. People as a whole are very good at a huge variety of tasks. I doubt I could walk into an English department and do that well at first, and I might ask 'can a person of average creativity ever manage to get a PhD in English?' The answer would be the same. Yes, but you need to figure out how to digest the material until it is as familiar to you as addition or the abcs.  
lower than average intelligent people can get a PhD. Most advice you get comes from less than average intelligent people. Don't listen to anyoe and just do what you want.
I some how got a hons in theoretical physics and I did fuck all work, went to about 15 lectures over the years and got hammerd most nights. I managed to get some phd offers so I'm sure you could easily manage it if you were actually trying.
Absolutely not possible. Getting a bachelor's degree is also out of reach. The key here is that really smart people are already working very hard to finish these degrees. A person of average intelligence may be able figure out what they need to, but it will take way longer than the years permitted to stay in these programs. 
> Is it that the ball's time velocity is converted into spacial velocity?

This is awfully close to the answer.  The answer geometrically similar to the situation that you cannot create parallel lines on a sphere's surface: http://www.schillerinstitute.org/graphics/diagrams/know_geom/fig7.jpg
OR this:
http://www.askamathematician.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/greatcircles.jpg

Notice how on a sphere's surface, there is a distinguishing characteristic that you can create a polygon with two sides, if you take two straight lines and carry them to each pole, they will meet up, because the surface is curved.  The answer is that all non-accelerating observers (inertial) follow straight lines on a curved surface of space time called *geodesics*.  As long as space time is curved, it means that two straight world lines that are initially parallel (in spacetime, this literally means at rest relative to one another) can intersect without any curving the world lines (acceleration or relative motion).

Here is an interactive demonstration visualization what is going on:
http://www.adamtoons.de/physics/gravitation.swf

Realize that no one can really visualize what is going on, not even Einstein could.  The mathematics is our language for understanding it, but our visual cortex is simply incapable of truly visualizing curved, 4D spacetime.  In the animation posted, there is only one dimension of space and one dimension of time.  This means we need a 2D surface that is curved, visualized as bending in a third dimension (this is called an embedding diagram).  To visualize 4D curved spacetime, we'd need to be capable of thinking in *five* spacial dimensions.  
This isn't a great explanation, but it's something. Maybe later I'll come up with something better.

Particles move through spacetime trying to maximize the proper time along their trajectory. More precisely, given initial and final positions at fixed times, the path that the particle takes is the one with the greatest proper time.

Now suppose you have a ball that starts and ends at the same position (say, the top of the tower) at given times. For a fixed interval of coordinate time, there is more proper time higher up, so the ball will want to spend most of its time up high, only coming back when its time is almost over. In other words, if it starts out going up, then later it's going to come down. It makes sense to say that if it starts out with zero vertical velocity, its fate will be to end up lower than it started; to end up at the same height it needs a positive initial velocity.
A ball at rest that starts falling can be explained in GR in exactly the same way as in Newtonian gravity. That's because Newtonian gravity [can be formulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cartan_theory) in terms of a curved spacetime as well. The only conceptual difference between Newtonian gravity and GR is that the former uses a Riemannian manifold whereas the latter uses a Lorentzian one. If this weren't the case, it wouldn't be possible for GR to reduce to Newtonian gravity in the nonrelativistic limit. Incidentally, GR can also be formulated in terms of a static background and a force like classical Newtonian gravity, but that is quite more complicated and in some ways less natural.

There is one very important difference when one goes to the curved spacetime view, however. In classical Newtonian gravity, a ball at rest is really at rest, and it starts accelerating in a gravitational field when let go. On the other hand, in Newton-Cartan gravity, a ball at rest is really accelerating because it is not following a geodesic, whereas it starts following a geodesic in unaccelerated motion only when let go. And indeed, an accelerometer at rest on the Earth measures an acceleration -g and it measures no acceleration when freely falling.

Edit: [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTVIMOix3I) explains this phenomenon visually. Notice that the curved lines are really straight (unaccelerated) lines, but they appear curved because the spacetime has been distorted. The same thing happens both in GR and Newton-Cartan gravity.
>Is it that the ball's time velocity is converted into spacial velocity?

This is essentially correct.  Both space and time curve such that motion initially in the temporal direction becomes motion in a spatial direction.

This is more easily visualized in [this video with a contraption to help visualize what it means for time to be curved](http://youtu.be/jlTVIMOix3I).

>And the reason the object moves is because when the ball moves slower in time, it has less energy?

This part is not correct however.  A ball moving slower in time will have more kinetic energy, not less.

Hope that helps!
All objects fall at the same rate, regardless of their mass. Unlike in electromagnetism where the charge does matter. Mass generates gravity, but the motion of the object does not depend on the objects mass. This is unlike most other forces we see.

So we postulate that mass does not generate a force field. Instead mass affects the geometry around it, since it affects all objects the same. Since objects clearly move as time passes, we must find a way to unify spacial and time components into our geometry, we call this spacetime.

First we must pass from geometry without time included to spacetime. A metric assigns a positive real number to every pair of vectors. A big example is length in ordinary geometry. It is given by

dL^2 = dx^2 +dy^2 +dz^2

Note that the length of an object is invariant between different observers. A rigid indestructible rod of length L will always be length L regardless of whatever transformations you apply to it's coordinates: rotations and translations. In other words

dL'^2 = dx'^2 +dy'^2 + dz'^2 = dL^2

In special relativity the key law is that the length of an object is NOT invariant. Instead a new quantity called the interval is invariant

ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 +dz^2

From here on take units where c=1 so 3*10^8 m = 1 s. The real meaning behind E=mc^2 is that E=m, or in other words energy IS mass. There is no difference between them. We define the rest mass of an object as its energy when in a rest frame.

In general relativity we take this idea further setting dx_0=t, dx_1=x, dx_2=y, dx_3=z. The interval can be written

ds^2 = g_uv dx_u dx_v (Sum from u,v=0 to 3)

where g_uv are real numbers, the components of the metric. In flat space, the case from special relativity, g_00=-1, g_11=g_22=g_33=1, and all other g_uv=0.

The Einstein Field Equations determine g_uv from the stress energy tensor T_uv. For the rest of this paragraph remember mass and energy are the same thing. The stress energy tensor's components are just T_00=energy density, T_01 through T_03 are flow of energy across xy and z axes, T_10 through T_30 are density of momentum in the xy and z directions, lastly T_ij are flow of i'th component of momentum across x_j axis. Note that T_01=T_10, T_02=T_20,T_03=T30.

Basically the Einstein Field Equations tell us that the flow and density of mass generates the metric for spacetime, which we interpret as curving spacetime's geometry. The key thing to understand is that with the interval ds^2 , time and length are both necessary to construct an invariant quantity, unlike in Euclidean geometry where you only need spacial components.
California's pretty big!

University physics departments typically have a few seminars a week on different topics. Most of them are highly technical, a few are aimed at a more general audience (colloquia). Many of them have food.

[Here](http://physics.berkeley.edu/events) for example are the upcoming seminars at Berkeley. The Bay Area is a bit of a hub.
UCLA physics seminars are open to the public. they have a calendar on their website.
If you have interests in astrophysics and/or planetary science, the SETI Institute hosts a regular Tuesday open colloquium at Microsoft's Mountain View campus in the SF Bay Area. Typically the 1-hour talks  are given by visiting professors and researchers in the field, sometimes by SETI scientists. And they even post the videos of the talks online if you're not able to attend.  A wonderful resource!

One good visualisation of divergence I have comes from Liouville's theorem. 

Remember how the divergence of the (velocity) field is directly related to the rate of change of the phase volume. You can see how this quantity physically influences the "growth" or "shrinkage" of a certain volume of a fluid. 

Thus, I imagine divergence to be something like a measure of how much a "source" or "sink" a point is. 

Similarly, it serves one well to think of curl in terms of a moving fluid. Curl is a measure of how much the field (or the fluid) is "twisting" about an axis (of flow). 

Imagine keeping a bead on a circular wire, with the axis parallel to the flow. If there were any rotation ("twisting") in the fluid, the bead would move around. 

Curl is defined as the "circulation" per unit area, which is analogous to the work done around a closed curve. If the fluid has a "rotating" component, this work done will obviously be non-zero, as the "rotation" will lead to tangential components of force along the loop. 

So, the curl is simply "how much a fluid rotates about the axis of flow". 


Intuitively, I started off thinking of it like a tank of water, where divergence represents a flow in or out of the tank (a plug or a hose), and the curl represents the swirling of the liquid around a given axis. Now I just think of vector fields as loads of tiny arrows whose magnitude is dependent on field strength.

edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcFJKQPZfo this might help
Fermi Liquids obey various conservation laws similar to fluids, have a so-called hydrodynamic regime for certain energy/length scales, and have the equivalent of sound.


However, Fermi Liquids are much richer in physics than ordinary fluids. Instead of obeying just a simple Boltzmann equation as a gas would, they obey a more complicated Landau kinetic equation. Naturally, the usual conservation laws are at play (energy, charge, etc.), though it is important to note that some of these laws only apply when you consider the interaction of the Fermi Liquid with other excitations, such as phonons. Fermi Liquids also have multiple types of "vibrations" (zero sound, first sound, etc.), some of which are not found in any ordinary fluid.


To summarize everything in a single sentence: **I think it is best to understand a Fermi Liquid as a description of Quantum Plasma Physics.**

The best reference on the topic is Pines and Nozierres text on Fermi Liquids, Baym and Pethick is good too. Both texts go into a lot of detail on your question, much more than I can write here.

I don't know how tattoable they are, but I've always found bubble chamber plates to he pretty evocative and often use them as my backgrounds. For example:

TODO: learn enough stuff to understand this article
Stunning and humbling.

It's 1 IGBU (Izze Glass Bottle Unit).
The difference between your solution and the given solution is that you didn't use the step that it must be true for all x. You only did the x=0 case. If you did the x = pi/2k case you could have recovered a second solution. If you did that in your way I believe you would get a solution of 2Asin(kx), k=2pin/L which is good because for a second order differential equation you should get two linearly independent solutions.

To put it another way, your solutions done in your method should give:

 Psi_1 = Psi_+ + Psi_-=cos(2npix/L)

 Psi_2 = Psi_+ - Psi_-=sin(2npix/L)

And up to normalization your answer would be correct assuming boundary conditions work out, which is why you got the right energy levels.

For coefficients, it is because wavefunctions need to be normalized.

Hope that helps.
I'd appreciate it if anyone could help! Thank you!
In the step when you cancel (exp(2ikL)-1), you are dividing by zero if k=n*pi/L
No, oh god no!  It actually skips over a lot of basic quantum mechanics.  Sakurai, for it's first half at least, is more of a tour de force of selected basic concepts presented in a more advanced fashion.  You will not learn QM from Sakurai. 

Shankar is popular.  Some people like Griffith, is definitely the most unique and undergrad oriented.  At the same time, unlike his E&M book, it's not that good.  And the same time, there's really no *good* undergrad/first time QM book unless you have a lot more math under your belt than the average first timer.
Sakurai is great but it is not an introductory text. I haven't looked at any modern books but Townsend, as suggested above has been recomended by others.
Of the books listed, you should go with Shankar. And this is coming from a huge L&L fan.

Of course it never hurts to use multiple resources. If you're planning on grad school, you'll likely need Sakurai eventually.
I used Sakurai for my graduate level QM class. It was an ok book given that I had already sat two semesters of undergrad QM, however, I would not suggest it as an introduction even if you are highly trained in mathematics. IMO, the order and way the topics are presented in Sakurai only make a lot of sense if you have a general knowledge of the fundamentals of QM.

If you're set on it anyway I'd take a couple lower level books along for the ride to reference - Griffiths, Gasiorowicz, and maybe something like the relevant portions of Feynman lectures.
>Pauling/Linus

Isn't this more towards chemists ?
Use A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics by Townsend. Sakurai is too advanced for a first introduction, but good for a third course in QM.
If you haven't done it yet, do a quick google search and try to find his most recent papers. Try to read them and at least have an idea of what it's about. You'll probably won't understand everything, but some questions will pop out in your head. During the interview, your professor may tell you some of his current projects, and you'll already have something to say or ask about it.

Also, don't say that you know how to use some software, if you don't. Even if you know how it works globally from an outside perspective, someone can easily tell if you're lying by asking you some specific question about that software. Instead, tell him that you haven't had the opportunity to try it, but that you could do some tutorials by yourself before starting working for him. 
It shows motivation, autonomy and commitment, which are arguably the most important quality for an undergrad. 
Seconded on the "look up what they do/have recently done" front. Showing interest in the work is the most important thing.

I'd also say that if you get asked any questions about your background be completely honest but optimistic about learning new things. Chances are you have no practical experience in the field he works in, but there's absolutely no reason you can't quickly learn and if you're confident in that fact he will be too. Cite your academic performance if that bolsters your case on that front.

Lastly remember that chances are he's looking forward to teaching you some stuff and letting you loose on a problem or showing you the ropes and giving you some lab tasks to handle. In my experience professors that like doing research with undergrads are very excited about adding to their group and mentoring new people. It's unlikely that the outcome will be worse than "take this class and keep in touch, I'll have some stuff for you soon" unless you're competing for a paid position or something.

Good luck!
This ALL seems really quite weird to me. When I want to work with a professor, I just bluntly ask if they will have me. So far it has worked rather well for me - this method has taken me to the Arctic and has lead me into quantum entanglement research.
I believe its because they use very large (10m diameter or something like that) dishes on the ground, but need to use a much smaller receiver on the satellite itself, which affects link capacity.
Sounds to me like the ground can interface with more than one satellite simultaneously for faster speeds. 
No. An antenna is a *transformer*. It couples EM waves in the impedance of free space to some other impedance.

Transmit and receive are rarely close enough together that you care about their mutual interaction: the transmitter generates waves into free space, the receiver sees waves traveling in free space, and doesn't care what piece of metal generated them.
I would look at it in terms of kinetic energy loss due to drag where the kinetic energy loss is the drag force times the distance.

If calculus and integrals are not your forte,
this could be approximated numerically over 100 miles fairly readily by assuming 100x 1 mile segments, recalculating the drag force in each segment based on the velocity after the kinetic energy losses of the prior segments.

There are dozens of lectures online available for free. Just do a search for "Physics lectures". All of Feynman's series is out there as well as dozens of full college courses for free. https://www.google.com.mx/search?q=Physics+Lectures&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=h_sDWMOoCsWMjwPnsL6QDg
It's never too late! Anything by Richard Feyman is fantastic. However, you should consider community college for physics, as there have been even astronauts who have gone that route
Besides those free learning resources already mentioned (Feynman lectures, Khan Academy, etc), there are a wealth of other free materials available online.  Here are some of them:

Found this in a post a while back : http://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics 
Should be perfect for you

I also like MIT opencourseware a lot
Many textbooks that are required are available as free pdf downloads. 
The Feynman Lectures are free and online. You can find them [here](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/). They are a great read and cover a wide variety of material at a level that is understandable. I would recommend them for anyone that is interested in physics.
Take a community college class. Not terribly expensive and only 19 more and you'll have an associate degree
Freedman and Young's University Physics is a great place to start. It has a lot of exercises and covers a large amount of physics in a manner that makes sense. It has a lot of summaries and is generally easy to follow.

I *don't* like Feynmann's books. They have too much focus on his clever way of thinking about things that is really just pointless. I absolutely hate the part about potential energy where he talks about reversible and irreversible machines. It's unnecessarily complicated and tbh it scared me off when I didn't understand it (and saw many other people online who also didn't understand it). Maybe it gets better further on...

Anyway, both will require a small amount of calculus knowledge (and calculus intuition)
Look, there are a lot of good physics books, video lectures, websites etc. (many are mentioned in the comments), but of you want to "get into" physics, as opposed to learning some physics for fun, go to college.
If you're a physics major, college will easily pay for itself through scholarships and labwork.  At least, that was my experience.
Khan Academy has some pretty good physics lessons. Pretty sure it's free. It was during my first year a few years back at least. 
You can audit courses for free @ edX. Can't remember the web address but just Google edx online courses or something and it should come up.
[Hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html) is a great resource. Not the best site to learn from exclusively, but when you need help putting ideas and formulas in context, I find it extremely helpful.
I like this series. Good luck!

 http://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics
Probably been posted but "PBS space time" is an absolutely excellent YouTube channel about astrophysics which goes quite in depth
Go to CC and transfer. I'm here now. Be frugal but don't stress about loans and work hard. Look at engineering as well, it's easy to do the prerequisites for physics and engineering at the same time and transfer as both eng and physics.
College doesn't nearly cost as bad as a lifetime of not getting a good job.
I feel like we should have something in the sidebar with a brief guide to physics for various people

eg I want to become a physicist & im in high school 
 I just want to learn physics in my spare time 

It could include textbook names etc for the various ways in which people want to learn physics. cause we get these kinda questions literally every day.  
[removed]
https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/9332550441/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&condition=new

Highly recommended
For lower-level stuff, Khan Academy is great. For graduate-level stuff, pirsa.org is great. MIT OpenCourseWare covers a bit of everything, if you can be self-sufficient for the less-complete courses.
[Crash course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN0ge7yDk_UA0ldZJdhwkoV) is always fun.


MIT offers there course material for free, you could try there.
For an intro to physics for Physicists, check out the series of text books Matter and Interactions. Grab the first editions from Amazon for about 5$ each shipping (or find the PDF). They're fantastic. 

Some intro to physics texts suffer from trying to also teach chemists, engineers and the like, or being too out of reach. The latter case is the Feynman lectures which to be honest, is a great resource for folks who already know the material but want to see the wizardry that is Feynman but for newbies, is a tad out of control.
Cliché, but the Feynman lectures are great and available for free online. 
You can watch all the MIT physics lectures online, would be a great way to learn if you back yourself 
https://youtu.be/sc-uXaXwyuU
[Gerard 't Hooft, Theoretical Physics as a Challenge](https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/theorist.html)
I recommend taking the [Khan Academy courses](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home) on Calculus, Multivar Calculus, and Linear Algebra before or along side with the physics resources mentioned. I wouldn't have understood much of Feynman's lectures without. They're free, and provide the math basis you need to understand physics.
For about 35 dollars you can get an older edition of a general physics text book. Get one and read through it and take notes. Work practice problems and suppliment things you don't understand with khan academy. Also MIT has general physics open courseware. I recommend knight physics for the book.
Feyman is amazing, but I would also recommend math. As a business related major, I respect Physicist. Always asking why and solving things that we would never even think of. Scientists, researchers, they're the entrepreneurs of STEM.   
In addition to the Feynman lectures and the countless free lectures online, [HyperPhysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html) has long been a pretty good conceptual resource for undergraduate physics topics. Learn the basics of any fundamental physics subject with simple and straight forward segments. 
Worldscienceuniversity.com , founded by Brian Greene is great start if you are into general relativity and quantum physics. Courses are very well organized with lecture videos and then assignments.
Personally just somebody who likes to learn about, I'm not taking any classes. However, the well-known Stephen Hawkings does have multiple books, some directed for scholars and others to explain his (and others) findings in a simple manner so pretty much anybody can understand
How's your math, OP?
 [So You Want to Learn Physics](http://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics) has some great advise and sources on how to get started and the best books to teach yourself.
Susskind's physics lectures are on-line and pretty accessible.  You can also find more rigorous lectures and texts like Landau and Lifshitz on-line pretty easily.


I would highly recommend A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking.  It's a fairly good mid-level overview of modern physics.  I recommended it to my father, who also has a B.S. in physics, and he loved it as well.  
Right so I realize the maths here is truly horrendous but I want to give it a go to see if anyone has any pointers

Let's take a wave **E** = **E**_0 sin(k.x - ω.t)

We know n = k(ω) * ω/c

We also know n is only a function of historic **E** values. Is it fair to assume:

n = ʃG(t) * **E**(t) dt    with something like a Green's function?

Plugging in our trial wave we have

n = ʃG(t) * **E**_0 sin(k.x - ω.t)) dt

Dispersion relations depend on frequency NOT intensity so there must be a way to argue that **E**_0 shouldn't have been there in the first place (vomit-inducing reasoning I know)

n = ʃG(t) *  sin(k.x - ω.t))

Equating we have k(ω) * ω/c = ʃG(t) *  sin(k(ω).x - ω.t)) dt

which can then be solved for G


A good understanding eh? That's bold! This book ( https://www.amazon.com/Facts-Mysteries-Elementary-Particle-Physics/dp/981238149X ) may be near what you're looking for. Not quite textbook, but not exactly popsci either. 
I think you'd enjoy reading an excellent 8-part survey series on contemporary particle physics written by theoretical physicist Matthew Buckley, professor at Rutgers U: http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/matthew-buckley-physics-series

Since you didn't mention knowing about quantum field theory, I highly recommend the second piece in the series on QFT: [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Quantum Field Theory](http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/matthew-buckley-search-new-physics-cern-part-2).  But really, since you expressed an interest in particle physics, the whole series is worth reading.
My thoughts are that it is important to be aware that at present there are several levels of certainty that can be attached to different periods in the universe's evolution.  With a high degree of confidence based on established physics and experimental findings, cosmologists have an understanding of the evolving universe from approximately 1 second after the big bang to the present, 13.8 billion years later. Based on particle physics, scientists can extrapolate a bit earlier with ideas that can't be directly confirmed yet. Theoretical physicist Matt Strassler has written a very interesting article [Which Parts of the Big Bang Theory are Reliable, and Why?](https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/26/which-parts-of-the-big-bang-theory-are-reliable).  He presents 4 periods with different levels of reliabiiity. It's an easy read which I think you might enjoy.

But what caused the Big Bang is not currently known with any certainty.  Multiple speculative ideas abound, such as the universe emerged from (1) "nothingness", or (2) a cyclic bounce from a pre-existing contracting universe, or (3) a pre-existing background spacetime, or (4) an eternally inflating multiverse, etc etc.  Also, the idea of an initial singularity is speculative. It is based on the equations of Einstein’s General Relativity, which is a classical theory that does not account for quantum gravity effects. There are cyclic bounce theories, for example, from work in loop quantum cosmology proposing that the bounce avoids the singularity. 

The same multiple varieties of speculative work exist regarding the nature and concepts of time.  

Here's an example to indicate how much diversity there is in leading edge theoretical  research on the origins and very early history of the universe as well as on the nature of time: twenty or more scientists will meet for a 4 or 5 day conference and each present talks and papers on their latest theoretical work, much of which differs from each other.  So just be aware that the physics of the universe from about 1 second after the big bang is well established, but becomes more and more speculative at times closer to the beginning point. And also, the nature of time has a similar very diverse multitude of ideas that scientists (and philosophers of science) are working on.

My thoughts are that your teacher did a very poor job of teaching you any of the multitude of physics that we actually know about the Big Bang. Instead he buried you in platitudes and assertions without explaining any evidence for how we describe the Big Bang. Sorry. Rant over. 
First year of grad school, so I'm trying to balance coursework with research obligations. In undergrad, I was used to banging out weekly homework assignments by myself in one sitting. Now problem sets take much longer, and I often have to collaborate with others. Probably the biggest adjustment for me.

In terms of research, I'm working on building a proton detector to measure branching ratios of beta-delayed proton emissions in an effort to constrain thermonuclear reaction rates relevant to astrophysical processes like x-ray bursts and classical novae.

In the microwave part of the spectrum, a plastic box is more likely to refract than absorb, and that would be more likely if the box were a solid cube. Ah -- in your title you say "box" but in your text you say "bin", so there's some room for confusion. Maybe you should provide a wavelength of interest, and the intended application.

Are you using the charcoal at the bottom to vaporize in the heating process to fill the chamber with, I'm assuming, CO2? I assume this is to minimize the amount of O2 in the chamber though I don't know why. Would it be possible to explain that part a bit more?
What's the risk in exceeding the amount of charcoal required?  Risk of failing to keep oxygen concentration below a certain level? If you need fine control over the composition of the atmosphere and pressure inside I would put an analyzer on the exhaust and pipe in your own modified atmosphere. Getting it "just right" with a charge of charcoal is probably a lot more difficult and could require modulating temperature.
Were you inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/57jwg7/the_lissajous_curve/) post, or is it just pure coincidence that there are multiple Lissajous curves on my front page right now?

This paper might help: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.3824.pdf.

Ultimately, your question can be answered by the fact that fields transform (usually) as irreducible representations of the Lie Algebra of the underlying symmetry group. The electron (field) happens to have spin 1/2 (i.e. the internal spin of particles is measured to be 1/2 in units of hbar), so therefore it transforms as the spin 1/2 ( (1/2,0) + (0,1/2) ) representation of so(3,1).
On the theme of spin structures and spinor bundles I mentioned in the other comment, try [this book](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/4573.html).

As to why ultimately the SM fermions are fermions (and so spinors by spin-statistic) there is no explanation at the level of the SM itself. They could have been bosons (unlike, say, the photon or the W or the Higgs, which *must* be bosons). It's just this way because it is. There are various irreps of the Poincaré group and nature likes to use most of them.
You are mistaken. The center of mass does not change as the bottle will move in response (just try it out!).

In classical mechanics, you can -always- find a reference frame where the center of mass is stationary if there are no external forces acting on the object.

This is actually often done to simplify calculations, for example in your case:

Consider a water bottle at rest in space. You spin it around its initial center of mass and want to describe the average motion of the system in some way. 

Now, there are two ways of looking at this: 
You could glue yourself to the inside of the bottle. The water will then nearly chaotically move around and you'd be scratching your head if there is anything reasonably going on at all.

The other way is looking at the bottle from outside. You'd see it spinning around its center of mass and while water and bottle would both move about chaotically, it'd in average just spin stationarily.
You can only use the trick of choosing a different axis when the objects are it static equilibrium. If it's rotating, it has a definite axis of rotation. If the object is free from external forces, the axis of rotation must pass through the center of mass.

For the water bottle scenario, I would approach it as a stationary center of mass, with a varying inertia tensor. This all gets quite mathematically complicated quickly. See the [euler rotation equations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_equations_(rigid_body_dynamics\)) for more, but note that they only apply to rigid bodies. If you have a deforming object then there are even more complicated terms for including dI/dt.
I read somewhere that time could be seen as an emergent phenomena of causality. Would that go in line with what is  written in the article?

To continue with the example from special relativity, I suppose two events can be experienced in different order for two observers. But causality can only go one way, and should not look different for the two observers. That means that events that have a causal dependency should always be seen in the same order for all observers?

From my amateur point of view, it looks like time is something illusive, but causality isn't.
In our current theories, time is continuous, so the answer is no.

However, there's a good point in your question: sometimes, pop science likes to simplify physics so that things look discrete. For example, they talk about an "electron jumping between energy states", as you say, and it gives the impression that this happens instantaneously. Actually, the evolution of the electron wavefunction is perfectly continuous, and it always transitions between two states via intermediate superpositions.
AddictedReddit is wrong. Plank time has nothing to do with the smallest measurable time interval. Plank scales are simply scales at which current theories would break down. There is nothing to suggest they are the smallest measurable scales
[deleted]
The process creates the time (or the spacetime) anything with mass 'gives rise' to spacetime, we know this from relativity, on or near a black hole the length of time is longer, and further you are away from mass the shorter the length of time, its relative. 

So no two 'times' or length of passage of times are the same (but many are close, we refer to that as a frame of reference). 

With spacetime it is the same as the length of space (the length of time that is), the distance between two points requires two points, matter 'gives rise' to spacetime, and without a process (or matter) time and space would have a length of zero. 

You could also consider an electron in a quantum leap (from one state to another) it is in one state, then it is in the other state **it is not anywhere in between the states**, what seems to happen in that process is that the space and time for that leap is encapsulated into a photon. 
Astronomer here!  I am pleased to say this is my first (and hopefully not last) piece for *Scientific American*! :D I mean "only" a guest blog post, but who turns that down?

Anyway, always thought sonoluminesence should be discussed more because it's damn cool, hope some others agree.
Surely we have fast enough spectrometers now to figure this out. If the temperature is so high (however defined in this system) why is it not just related to blackbody radiation?

I remember twenty years or so ago some dude was publishing that he had seen evidence of fusion during S-L, but then didn't it turn out he'd been misrepresenting his results?

> r/askphysics is practically worthless.

Looks to me like /r/AskPhysics is busy, thriving, and helping out anybody who wants to post a question.  What's the problem?  How is it 'practically worthless'?
This is an insightful question! 

Yes, just like in an ideal gas, pressure helped expand the universe. It was mainly due to tons of photons rather than just gas, but the principle is similar. This pressure contributed mostly in the early universe, back when the universe was very dense.

When the universe got spacious enough, the pressure got low and didn't matter so much, compared to other forces like gravity, which slowed down the expansion of the universe. Logically, we expected the gravity to pull the universe back together in sort of a "big crunch," but when we actually looked with the Hubble Telescope, we found that there's some other mysterious force that gets *stronger* in a larger total volume, rather than weaker, like with pressure or gravity. This force is the one we call "dark energy," mysterious because it's puffing up the universe more and more as it gets bigger, rather than less and less as you'd expect from pressure. 

So, yes, you're absolutely correct, but that isn't our culprit. We've still got a mystery on our hands, here!

4 MW is quite a lot, is this even close to break even? Let alone self sustainability.
THIS IS AMAZING! 


If we could build larger experimental reactors then it would be much easier to make it a sustainable choice.

I just wish that there was more funding for nuclear fusion so we would speed up and switch to nuclear fusion solving many of our energy related problems.


But... I guess money will continue to go to footballers rather than scientists changing the possible progression of the human race. 
If you're here to learn about fusion, the best discussion is buried under /u/derivative_of_life's comment, which was mass-downvoted because people didn't like his tone.

...Two atmospheres? Seriously? *Two atmospheres?* They've been working on this shit for like 4 decades now and they can't produce more than two atmospheres of pressure? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly sure the pressure at the core of the sun is higher than two atmospheres. 

You can downvote me if you want, but it's not going to make self-sustaining fusion reactions possible at two atmospheres of pressure.

eta: The more I read, the worse it gets:

> The amount of power produced increases with the square of the pressure — so doubling the pressure leads to a fourfold increase in energy production.

-

>The plasma produced 300 trillion fusion reactions per second

300 trillion fusion reactions per second produces about as much power as three guys on bicycle generators. They admit *right there* in the article that they would need at least a 3 or 4 order of magnitude increase in pressure to make this concept viable for power generation, and the very best they've been able to achieve in over a *decade* is *fifteen percent*. How can *anyone* think this is even a remotely practical approach to fusion power?

>I have what may be a somewhat irregular request: I'm interested in course webpages/syllabi. Specifically ones for courses which follow one textbook rather closely and hopefully post which textbook sections to read and homework problems (solutions optional).

I need a textbook that covers conductivity (more specifically, semi- and superconductivity).
can anyone recommend a second course continuum mechanics book? after Reddy, Krempl/ Lai... first course intro? (i don't know much math though after calc3+ode)
I'm looking for a really slow, extensive, easy to follow explanation of POVMs and the partial trace. I recently started a quantum communication & cryptography course and I just can't make sense of these two topics.
Does anyone know where can I get english version of "Алексеев сборник задач по классической электродинамике решебник" ?

Anyone know of some good atomic physics books?
Having a lot of trouble in my upper level mechanics class. The text used in the class is John Taylor's book but I was wondering if anyone had any better/different recommendations. Youtube and Internet sources are also welcome
Yes, there are many such special functions. Many are solutions to some differential, difference, or functional equations that cannot be expressed in terms of the elementary functions. Examples include the Gamma function and its progeny (Digamma, Beta, etc.), the many Bessel functions, Spheroidal/Cylindrical functions, Elliptic functions/integrals, Fresnel functions, etc.

You can find information about many of these including their properties and integral representation at [Wolfram Functions](http://functions.wolfram.com/). Computer Algebra Systems like Mathematica and Maple know all about these special functions (though often not everything). A standard and comprehensive reference for such integrals is [Gradshteyn and Ryzhik](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123849330/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=WTZW5WY7232Q5R7BTBE0). 
There are sometimes tricks using "generating functions." Let's say you want to solve an integral of the form

f(n) = ∫ x^n F[x] dx

and you know the analytic solution to the integral

Z[J] = ∫ e^(J x) F[x] dx

Then 

f[n] = d^(n)Z[J = 0]/dJ^(n)

where my notation intends to tell you to set J=0 after taking n derivatives with respect to J. The derivatives may be tedious, but they're usually less tedious than the integrals.
There's the [error function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function).
I am just a lowly engineer who is several years out of his "advanced" math class and all I have to say to your integral is "bless your soul". 
Elliptic integrals are pretty cool. Very useful in mechanics.

Polylogarithms are also ubiquitous in statmech, in particular for half-integer order (but they don't call them with their name, so you don't realize).
x^(a-1)/(exp(x)-1) from 0 to infinity evaluates to gamma(a).riemannzeta(a)
See the back of Griffiths quantum book. Lots of good functions there
Sounds like you need a CRC
Somewhat related is that you can use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate a definite integral. Just generate a bunch of points, calculate values, and interpolate. The more points you generate, the more accurate and precise your estimate. 
This is getting embarrassing! At what point does cosmology admit they got it wrong and start to direct efforts into finding what is really going on?
>Is this something graduate schools frown upon?

I'm no expert on graduate admissions, and I took five and a half years to graduate, but I don't think they care in the slightest. I'm in a graduate program now (not a terribly well-ranked one, however, so this may change depending on what you want), and programs regularly take students who did not graduate in conventional ways. 

Personally, I'd look on a student much more favorably who took a double major and did well academically than one who graduated one semester earlier, and didn't take an extra major (assuming it's relevant to what they want to study) or who let their grades slip because they overloaded themselves. Maybe someone else will yell at me that I don't know what I'm talking about, but I can't see an extra semester or year mattering much. 

It *may* however, cause issues with getting funding for that first semester of grad school if you start in an off-season. Talk to specific programs about that.
Starting in the off semester can be complicated.  Other than that, it doesn't really matter if you take a little extra time.  If you take 8 years, that might get funny looks, but 5 isn't unusual.
What country do you live in? What area do you plan on specializing in?

I've always been told the quality of your work is much more important to grad schools than speed. They don't even look at your graduation date.
I don't really think they care. Maybe 6-7 years would be odd but 5 years really isn't that unusual.
[Yes](http://timmytelescope.com/images/spectra_elements.jpg).
There are two different phenomena at work here. A blackbody doesn't go from red to blue; it goes from red to yellow to white and stays there. The reason is that as it heats up you don't get less of the lower wavelengths (i.e. red), you just get more of the higher wavelengths (i.e. blue). Eventually you have a lot of energy all over the spectrum, and that looks white.

What /u/derioderio posted are the emission lines for various elements. This is relevant precisely when you have something that is not a perfect blackbody - certain atoms or molecules have defined wavelengths at which they emit light, and this is what gives color to blue or green fire, for example.
There are theories that predict the colors emitted when stuff burns.  How tricky those theories are depends on what you start with - I don't think anyone's actually started with the standard model and worked all the way up to 'copper burns green' in steps, but it's believed to be possible in principle.

There are also tables and charts.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_test


A nice article, but the author could have checked it a bit more carefully.

> the detector’s atomic clocks can detect the split-second difference that it takes for laser beams to travel down one arm versus the other.

This is not how LIGO works. This is not how any of this works.

> In June, LIGO detected gravitational waves a second time, from an event named GW151226. 

In June, exactly as the naming scheme suggests: 15 for 2016 and 12 because June is the 12th month in the year.
> The memory effect will look like an additional flare of gravitational waves near the end of the event that caused the main burst of gravitational waves, he adds.

That makes it sound like you can detect this memory effect as it occurs, not afterwards. I'm guessing you can't do some measurements on a bit of spacetime after the event and work out whether or not some gravitational waves once passed through.
Overall I did consider this a good article.  However the use of the phrases "gravitational wave memory" and "permanently alter spacetime" seem like very bad choices of wording to me because a straightforward intuitive interpretation implies more about these phenomena than is really there.

For example -- "permanently alter" implies that the alteration can't be undone.  But if another gravitational wave affects the same system later in the opposite way, two objects that have their distance shrunk can then have it stretched back to its original distance or more.  So the initial effect may be *lasting* but it is not *permanent*.

Similarly, "memory" implies that information about an event can be reliably recalled, but if a later event undoes the original change, there is no way to recall that either event happened by looking only at instantaneous properties of the system (except by recording them with an external record, but then it is the *external* record that has the memory, not spacetime or the system itself), nor even that *either* event ever happened.  If there was a real memory, both events could be recalled even if they cancelled each other out.  So there really is no *memory* at all -- there is just *dynamic structure*.  But then we already knew that about spacetime ...

I really detest when researchers or journalists suggest things have a "memory" just because they have a dynamic structure that changes in response to phenomena.  By that definition, literally every object in the universe has a memory ... but that doesn't mean homeopathy actually works, rofl.
Conversely, PBS Space Time did a wonderful piece on YouTube today titled, [Black Holes from the Dawn of Time ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcv_tYcRgw4):

>Primordial black holes may be lurking throughout our universe. How large are they, how many are out there and what would happen if they moved through our solar system? 

My brain completely melted at the part where a billion-ton black hole has an event horizon the size of a proton, and if that didn't exacerbate my anxiety enough, there's probably a litany of these guys passing through the earth everyday like it's air while at the same time expelling a billion joules of Hawking radiation.﻿
Spacetime returns to its initial state, it doesn't oscillate at an increasingly lower amplitude indefinitely?
Layman here.  Is it fair to assume that even if the supposition is true that the effects would be too small to account for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe?
actually, much larger gravitation waves with memory were predicted mathematically by d. Christodoulou in 2005, in his paper--book on the formation of black holes
Can't upvote this enough, great article. 
Good read.
What if each collision of everything ads space and that why it's expanding.

It seemed like black holes could be just the after effect of the collision such when lightning strikes and the air fills the resulting vacuum.

The gravitational wave is like the sound wave emitted as a result.

This is interesting to think about because it would depend space to travel just as sound requires denser more solid matter.

I use numerical methods much more often than closed-form equations, but there was very little treatment of that in my undergrad classes. I wish there had been homework assignments like "write a program to calculate the electric field around..."
I really wish that I had been taught what a Green's Function is.

I wish I had had a proper treatment of error analysis as an undergrad. I didn't get one until grad school.

I *still* don't know very much optics. In a sort of backwards way, I know more about beam optics in the context of accelerators more than I know about simple optics of light.

Things like complex analysis, PDEs, and Green's functions, which I've never had a rigorous course on, but have managed to pick up what I need from other courses.
I wish my education (in physics) had been more mathematically rigorous. 
I wish someone would have given me a non-bullshit explanation for what a path integral is. Even super-well regarded books like Masao and Doi's pretend you can take limits that you just can't.
I wish we were taught more about high-frequency electromagnetism. I remember doing fragments when we learnt circuits, but nothing beyond that's. 

Now I'm working with RF waveguides and high frequency is all I do :p
I wish we'd been given a proper introduction to phase space and what a significant concept it is in physics. It was just dropped into our QM class and again in classical mechanics in a way that I feel that really doesn't do it justice.
Looking back, I wish I had done more differential equations. It's my fault for doing pure maths.
Special functions.  In undergrad they just kinda sprung things like Hermite Polynomials and the associated mathematical tricks on you with minimal, handwavy, explanations and hoped you'd just eventually figure it out yourself.  We  could have at least gone over Sturmlouville equations in math methods, you know?  Instead we learned how to solve a cubic equation and why you can't solve a quartic or above. 
I always hated that necessary math was taught concurrently with physics that needs that math.  It was always a problem for me. I need to understand the math, for math's sake, first then use it in physics.  Struggling with vector calc, for example, while simultaneously doing E&M, which is very vector calc heavy, meant that I really wasn't engaging E&M on a conceptual level.  In fact, I never really learned E&M particularly well until I had to "re"learn it for my comps.  It was similar with Classical Mechanics and ODE and Mathematical Physics, Complex Analysis and basic field theory, etc.

I also wish that concepts were put before problem solving.  Most problems I solve today, I just do numerically.  It would have been better to understand the concepts of, say, scattering better rather than spending a huge amount of time dicking around with spherical harmonics and partial waves.
This is just a press release. Where is the actual link?
Saw his talk at March meeting. Very interesting and clever stuff, as one might expect from Frenkel, but hardly as universal as the headline implies.
Energy is the thing that is conserved when systems don't depend on what time it is. More technically, it arises from [Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem), and is the conserved quantity associated with time-translation symmetry. This is not as arbitrary or tautological-sounding as definitions like "energy is the capacity to do work (and work is a change in energy!)."

One misconception that people often have is the idea that things *are* energy or can be *made of* energy, when it makes more sense to say they *have* energy.
To the best of my understanding, here are three definitions of energy listed in order of increasing accuracy/complexity/satisfaction:

* energy is the capacity to do work
* energy is the time-component of the four-momentum vector
* energy is the conserved current corresponding to invariance of the physical action of a system under time-translation transformations

The first definition is the mostly intuitive layman definition: energy is the capacity to do work on other systems.  This definition, while intuitive, has exceptions (such as forms of energy thay can't be harnessed to do work, like dark energy and zero-point energy) and is rather unsatisfactory because it is immediately circular:  it begs the question, "what is work?" and then work is basically defined as a transfer of energy between systems and is measured in units of energy.  But, for the majority of ordinary everyday systems, this definition is at least broadly accurate.

The second definition is a bit more abstract, but still at least modestly intuitive.  In classical mechanics, objects have a property "momentum" which is a vector with 3 components (a "three-vector"), one for each dimension of space.  In relativity however, space and time are unified into a four-dimensional construct: spacetime.  Accordingly, there needs to be a four-dimensional generalization of three-vectors, adding a component corresponding to the time dimension and thus promoting them to a four-vector.  In the case of the momentum four-vector, the time component happens to be the energy (along with a conversion factor to get the units right, which may vary in different contexts according to what conventions are used for the units).  Accordingly, you can think of energy by way of a simple analogy:  energy is to time as momentum is to space.

The last definition is very technical and much less intuitive, but it is also the most general and most correct definition.  It has to do with the behavior of systems under symmetry transformations.  Emmy Noether published an extremely important theorem, called Noether's Theorem, which in oversimplified terms states that for every continuous (more specifically, differentiable) symmetry that a system exhibits, there is a corresponding conserved quantity.  This extremely general theorem can be applied not only to energy but to many other symmetries and conserved quantities.

For example:  isolated systems possess something called "translation symmetry," which means that their behavior is unchanged after the application of a "translation transformation," which just means moving it linearly to another location in space.  It doesn't matter where the system is in space, the behavior of the system remains the same -- it is invariant.  By Noether's theorem, that means the system has a conserved quantity related to this symmetry.  That conserved quantity is (linear) momentum.  Because systems are translation-invariant, their momentum is conserved.  By a similar token, systems also exhibit rotational symmetry -- if you rotate a system in space, its behavior also remains unchanged.  Therefore by Noether's theorem, the system's angular momentum is conserved.

So ... I mentioned above that in relativity, time is also treated as a dimension of 4-dimensional spacetime, and accordingly objects have a coordinate describing their location along the time axis.  So it is possible to translate systems along that axis to a different time coordinate.  This is the "time-translation transformation," and if a system's behavior is unchanged after a time translation (i.e. it behaves the same no matter *when* the system is located), then it possesses time-translation symmetry.  By Noether's theorem, there is a corresponding conserved quantity and that quantity is energy.

Hope that helps!

Edit:  Also it is worth noting that these quantities can be defined by the associated symmetry that, when possessed, leads to their conservation.  That does not mean that the quantity is something else when a system *doesn't* possess said symmetry.  When the symmetry doesn't exist, the quantity just isn't conserved.
Energy is that quantity that is always conserved as a consequence of the laws of physics not changing over time.  This is usually expressed via Noether's Theorem, which links symmetries of physical law (in this case, time-translation symmetry) with conserved quantities.

Noether's Theorem concerns local symmetries, which as another poster points out means that energy is only truly conserved locally.  However, in principle we can consider lots of local patches of spacetime, add up their energy inflow and outflow, and "stitch them together" to create a grand ledger that accounts for all exchanges of energy in the history of the universe going back to the Big Bang.

Which, I think, is really your answer - the energy currently in the universe came out of the Big Bang.  In one way or another, the quarks in your hadron got their energy through a long series of energetic interactions stretching back to the beginning of the universe that predates the very existence of those particles themselves!

How the Big Bang got all that energy, we can't yet say, and we don't know if we'll ever be able to say.  So far, the best we can do to trace back the evolution of the universe using the laws of physics that we know only takes us to a fraction of a second after the Bang.
First, let me emphasize that energy is indeed a property, not an object; things can't be energy or be made of energy, and the phrase "pure energy" belongs firmly in the domain of sci-fi.

> As a philosopher this begs the question: then where did that energy originate?

As physicists, we don't really think about those questions. That's where you come in ;-) I mean, it's fun to speculate sometimes, but ultimately physics always involves some sort of initial state which we basically take for granted. We don't ask where the energy comes from because it was already there in the initial state.

> So quarks and gluons inside hadrons move chaotically around creating kinetic energy which gives hadrons a lot of mass. where does this kinetic energy come from?

That's a particularly messy business because we don't find quarks and gluons on their own. They've been bound up into hadrons, with the requisite kinetic energy, since nearly the beginning of the universe. You have to pump in a huge amount of energy to break a quark or gluon out of its parent hadron. (This is part of why we make giant particle accelerators.)

It's commonly suspected that before that, the universe consisted of a quark-gluon plasma, where the energy per particle was so high that quarks and gluons did have enough energy to overcome the forces tending to pull them together into hadrons. As the universe expanded and cooled, this plasma condensed into hadrons. So you could say the energy came from the plasma. But that's just pushing the question off by another step: you could just as well ask where the energy of the plasma came from.

> For the higgs mechanisms the same applies. if this mechanism is responsible for electrons acquiring mass, then (I think) there must also be some conserved energy in this higgs field?

That one's a little funny because the Higgs field is actually at an energy _minimum_. Like, if there were no Higgs field, the universe would have _more_ energy than it does now, but for some reason there is an alternate configuration that has our current, minimized level of energy, and that configuration requires the existence of a Higgs field (with a nonzero value). The mass gained by electrons (and muons, and tau leptons, and quarks, and W and Z bosons) from their interaction with the Higgs field is less than the amount lost by introducing a Higgs field.

I mean, that's a very approximate, nontechnical description, but I think it gets the idea across.
My first guess is same as many others here, which is that energy is most easily and clearly defined via Noether's theorem. That raises an interesting point, which is that energy is defined by its conservation in a time-invariant system, and hence the statement of conservation of energy is essentially a tautology. I haven't really thought of it that way before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb2S7oge8TQ

in french, if you understand it.
"de quoi l'énergie est elle le nom", Etienne Klein, science philosopher
Energy has no real greater definition than the mathematical book-keeping role it plays in describing a system.  The most accurate definitions of energy, such as "the capacity to do work", are fairly unsatisfying if you're expecting something really interesting.

> then where did that energy originate?

Who knows?  Ignoring current cosmological issues for a moment, one can say the universe was allotted/possesses a certain quantity of energy in the beginning and that's all that can be experimentally verified.  There is the additional complexity here of dark energy and the fact that the expansion of the universe is accelerating which implies energy is being created in a manner to essentially keep energy density above a certain level as space expands (someone else can talk about this more, not my field).  However, on non-cosmological scales, like in a particle colliers, energy is conserved.

Energy in the perspective of QFT and Higgs fields and stuff, is essentially the amount of, conserved, "currency" available to excite the various fields.  Why that much currency?  Well why fields?  Why anything?  Physics is in the business of constructing quantitative models that match experiment.  We have very accurate verifiable models of these things and one of the key parameters is the energy of the system.

One thing the author fails to mention here is the cosmological proof of particle dark matter.  I have never seen any proof of concept of modified gravity explaining the CMB data.  To describe the correlation function and its peaks over multipole moments, I'm pretty sure we get amazing fits with cold dark matter.
Oh god. Not this again. 
Interesting article, however I found [this](https://aeon.co/essays/is-dark-matter-subatomic-particles-a-superfluid-or-both) article which is linked from it even more interesting. Combines both ideas.
Isn't gravity likely a particle too?
Wait, didn't we determine a few weeks ago that dark matter was just black holes? 
Here is a recommended multi-part doc that covers many  questions about what to expect in preparing for a physics education (including math), the life of a physics major, preparing for and surviving grad school, choosing a research area and advisor, getting a job, etc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KBovBeg_kl6nAk8fTBYQdHMo8o3o0IgunPE3R7_OEHM
Getting a PhD is great, but it's not necessarily "the best". Some people simply don't need it for their career path.

You should discuss your ideas with professors and students who you trust. It's very unlikely that anyone will try to steal any of your ideas, so don't worry so much about it.

You'll know you're on to something when your idea manages to perfectly explain some phenomena without violating GR or quantum mechanics in some way (at least until you know enough about them to feel comfortable violating them if your math holds true).

I can't really recommend any specific books for your level, but I will say that Youtube is a fantastic resource for learning about physics.

We don't get as many major discoveries these days because physics has gotten a hell of a lot harder. We have very few lone physicists anymore, and most groundbreaking research (theoretical or experimental) takes ages (and sometimes lots and lots of money) to complete.

Personally, I love the insanity of all of it. The universe is the perfect complexity machine.
How good are the prospects for physicists in finance related fields? I know it is stupid to study physics to find a job in finance but I already changed from aerospace engineering to physics and simply cannot afford to change again.

I've heard that physicists, chemists and mathematicians are highly valued in the finance sector, even more that people with related degrees. Are they confined to very specific roles or do they work in an environment with possibility to ascend in the hierarchy?

Being poor, I realized that I love money more than I love doing science and I don't want to spend my life in an academic bubble either, so those are my reasons.

Thanks!

How can I maximise my chances of getting a post-doctoral research position after PhD? 

Currently undergrad, but I'm nearing the end of my degree and realising that research positions in Radio Astronomy are few and far between. My grades are good, and I have some research experience (along with more planned), but what else can I do to distinguish myself from my peers? It's starting to get to the time where I have to decide whether to give astro my all, or look for a more 'open' field of physics research to enter.
How is the communication at your workplace? Do you have a few individuals you usually work together with or do they vary? Are you comfortable talking to your boss about any problem you may be having? where do you go to find out stuff you need to know for work.
It would be nice to be able to compare different kinds of physics related jobs in this way. I'm really curious about your stories!
Hi I am not a physicist but first year chemistry student please don't be mad at me.

Other students from department of physics laugh at us, they say that good physicist is also a chemist but good chemist is not a physicist.

My question is: What should I learn to be a chemist with a good knowledge of physics? As a chemistry students we take Physics I and II  and Physical chemistry I and II classes only.
Apparently what happened is that you came across the jpg image by itself without the lecture text that goes along with it. The lecture text is [here](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept02/Kinney/Kinney3.html#3.1)

It is worth mentioning that the racquetball is hollow, whereas the bb is solid. This gives an I/(m r^2) ratio of 2/3 for the racquetball, and 2/5 for the bb.

Basically, for a given total mass and size, a hollow sphere will need more energy for rotation than a solid sphere.

That said, both the hollow and the solid sphere will roll under idealized theoretical conditions. Ideal in this case being perfectly spheres, uniform distributions of mass, smooth surfaces, sufficient friction to roll without sliding (this is needed to remove the coefficient of friction from the model). 
Because this isn't what is actually happening, some part of the idealization must be breaking down. We can check each either by test or observation.

Are either of the spheres sliding instead of rolling? If so, our assumption about coefficient of friction will need to be addressed.

Does the behaviour remain constant as you move around the surface for test locations? If so, then most likely there's nothing about the surface we need to add to the model.

Does the behavior depend on the initial orientation of the spheres? If not, our assumption about uniform mass is probably all right.

Based on what you have told us, I think our model breaks down at the assumption that the spheres remain hard and spherical. Which unfortunately is very hard to devise a good experimental test to verify.

Tl;dr: I think you are on point re: the flat spot.
If the radius is larger it will have a larger moment of inertia, and less likely to move. Also depending on the material it may ha e a higher friction coefficent, and then not move because of friction.
I came to a similar conclusion as you did, that the racketball is compressible and therefore flattens a tiny bit at the bottom, making it less likely to roll. Tell your friend he's the stoopid one.
I think your theory is correct under the following assumptions:

* in a vacuum

* balls are perfectly spherical when uncompressed

* table surface is perfectly smooth

* table surface is incompressible

* neither of the balls is stickier than the other/friction is just enough to prevent the balls from gliding off

The last assumption is one that you made while refuting your friend's argument. From your post it isn't really clear what the surface the balls roll on is made of - cardboard, wood, glass? I suggest checking whether the second to last assumption applies.


You're completely right, except the friction playing a role. It does, when the ball is already moving. When it's at rest, instantaneous torque acts about ONLY THE POINT OF CONTACT, NOT ON THE CENTER OF MASS.
One thing to note, unless your table is steel or concrete, it likely has a very minute depression in the surface where the racquetball is sitting, the BB wouldn't have enough weight I wouldn't think to make any measurable change. That said, it may not be enough of a difference to stop it from rolling. 
[deleted]
I have a idea that I don't see posted yet. What if the racquetball has a non-uniform mass distribution. If the CoM was slightly off center this could provide a torque that counterbalances the torque provided by the tangential component of the normal force. An experiment could be designed to see if it were a similar spot that the racquetball seemed to settle on, thus implying that it needed the off-center CoM on the uphill side of the contact point. If it stops isotropically then my theory is most likely disproven.
So electrostatic attraction will have some play as to why a ball needs a force to move (thus static friction). My guess is that there is more electrostatic between the racquetball and the table than the other balls
Yea, rolling resistance is the clear dominant factor here
You are both right, explanation 2 fits, and overall this effect is called [rolling resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance), or rolling friction, which fits to the keyword in explanation 1.
Maybe the centre of mass isnt really at the centre, so itll roll to keep it at the lowest possible point and maybe the positions you placed it at had the centre of mass on one side
I could very well be wrong, but I'd guess that static friction is at least partly due to van der waals force which has to be overcome when rolling or picking the ball. I'd still guess that the compression still makes the bigger difference.
Good on you for getting in on Physics so early! I might be able to help, but I'm a little confused as to what your question is. What exactly do you want to know?
Unless you know about 3D fluid mechanics, don't bother looking into this yet. This is a very complicated problem.
Some other controversial non-winners were [Pascual Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascual_Jordan) for his work in quantum mechanics but probably didn't win because he was heavily involved with the nazi party.

[Jocelyn Bell Bunell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Bell_Burnell) for discovering pulsars.  Even though her adviser won when she was the one to actually discover them. Her own explanation on why she thinks she didn't win is on her wiki page.

[John Steward Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stewart_Bell) was also nominated the year he died for his inequality stuff and they don't award them posthumously.

There are probably many other stories like these but they are the only ones I am familiar with, seems like Northern Irish physicists are cursed though.



I had a look through the early [nobel prizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics) in physics a while ago and two people stood out primarily because I had never heard of them (everyone else that was awarded prizes back then are fairly well known now with their surnames attached to at least one phenomenon) and after looking at their wiki pages it didn't seem like they accomplished much or were well renowned.

[Gustaf Dalén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustaf_Dal%C3%A9n) for "for his invention of automatic valves designed to be used in combination with gas accumulators in lighthouses and buoys" in 1912.


[Manne Siegbahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manne_Siegbahn) for "for his discoveries and research in the field of X-ray spectroscopy" in 1924.


So they are both Swedish and to me it kind of looks like that is why they might have won it. As the authoer of this article writes "In physics, the selection committee in the early years was dominated by Swedish experimentalists"

Is anyone well versed in the history of automatic valves and gas accumulators or X-ray spectroscopy able to correct me on that? Was their work deserving?



John Updike! Wait, wrong thread . . .
Fred Hoyle was explicitly snubbed by the Nobel committee. His junior collaborator William Fowler won the 1983 prize for stellar nucleosynthesis yet Hoyle was ignored. Apparently the committee passed him over because of his crackpot beliefs in other fields such as microbiology and paleontology. He had also directly criticized the committee when they failed to include Jocelyn Bell in the 1974 prize.

Here's a good article on the controversy: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/03/fred-hoyle-nobel-prize

Also, Kenneth Wilson, the sole winner of the 1982 physics prize, has stated that Leo Kadanoff should have been included as well.

[Arnold Sommerfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld)
Like everything in life, hardwork, discipline and perseverance can take you very far.
Leonard Susskind's lectures are meant for exactly for someone like yourself. His book, *The Theoretical Minimum* is worth picking up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyX8kQ-JzHI&list=PLQrxduI9Pds1fm91Dmn8x1lo-O_kpZGk8
Learning physics (QM esp.) from a IEOR background is totally doable, but it really depends on you.  /u/RobusEtCeleritas's recommendation of Shankar is a good one, Griffiths would work too.  You've already had intro physics, so you don't need Feynman lectures or Halliday, Resnick etc.

It would be better if you could do it while you're still on your campus so you can go talk to physics faculty to discuss the tricky parts.
I might suggest Modern Physics by Krane. The 2nd edition is fine and is on Amazon for $16. It's nice because it starts off right where an introductory text ends. It presents the material a bit in the order it was discovered so you get some historical perspective on scientific thought and reasoning. It would then be followed by something like Griffiths... it's basically a bridge between introductory physics and Junior level physics major stuff. 

Yes it is  i would suggest MIT open courseware and just be disciplined!
(This helped me tremendously in my modern/quantum class) 
Sure, it's possible. Shankar's QM book is very good.
With enough time and perseverence you can teach yourself pretty much anything. 
Of course it is. Almost all of university you learn by yourself with a bit of guidance from your prof. Pick up Griffiths and work from Ch1 through Ch4/5 and if you're still more interested in the mathematical formalism check out Sakurai. 

Griffiths, while the mathematics is lacking I find does an excellent job helping with the concepts. 
It's *possible* to *invent* quantum and modern physics. So of course you can learn it
Assuming you know calculus from engineering, sure. Feynman lectures would probably be perfect for you, should be a good mix of physics at the right level.
Yes, you absolutely can learn it on your own. Might I recommend [Zettili's](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Mechanics-Applications-Nouredine-Zettili/dp/0470026790/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476226099&sr=8-1&keywords=zetilli) book as a good place to start.

You're probably also interested in relativity. Which book you get has a lot to do with your prior exposure to the subject and how deep you want to get into it. Here's the progression I would recommend

1.) If you've never had any relativity before, start with this cute little book by [Robert Resnick.](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Special-Relativity-Robert-Resnick/dp/0471717258/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1476226282&sr=8-5&keywords=robert+resnick) This book takes you through the basics of doing special relativistic calculations without getting much into the geometry of spacetime.

2.) If you have some exposure to GR, or have already read the previous book, I'm not sure what the next best standalone special relativity book is that introduces you to using tensors and gets a little bit into the geometry of spacetime. You could read the last chapter of [Griffiths](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Electrodynamics-David-J-Griffiths-ebook/dp/8120347765/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476226440&sr=8-1&keywords=griffiths) or the chapter on relativity in [Jackson](https://www.amazon.com/Classical-Electrodynamics-Third-David-Jackson/dp/047130932X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476226471&sr=8-1&keywords=jackson+electrodynamics). From what I recall, you should be able to read these chapters without too much trouble if you haven't read the rest of this book, but don't quote me on that.

3.) After that you're probably ready for general relativity. I really like [Carroll's book.](https://www.amazon.com/Spacetime-Geometry-Introduction-General-Relativity/dp/0805387323/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1476226538&sr=8-5&keywords=sean+carroll)

If you want to get even deeper, [Wald](https://www.amazon.com/General-Relativity-Robert-M-Wald/dp/0226870332/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476226578&sr=8-1&keywords=robert+wald) is probably the way to go. [MTW](https://www.amazon.com/Gravitation-Charles-W-Misner/dp/0716703440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476226616&sr=8-1&keywords=gravitation) is another option. There are also really good youtube lectures out there. If you get to this point, it might be worth youtubing a guy named Frederic Schuller -- he has an excellent lecture on general relativity that is also more mathematical than Carroll.

On the other hand, if you want to jump straight into astrophysics without learning all the fundamental physics that I've outlined here there are options out there for that too from what I hear. You definitely won't have as deep as an understanding, but a high-level understanding is still valuable, and may be exactly what you want... I don't really know. That said, if you want to take this route you'll have to get someone else's advice on that. I'm not too familiar with introductory astrophysics books aside from what others have told me.
So I'm taking a quantum mechanics class atm and my required text is really good, McIntyre, quantum mechanics, I highly recommend it. For modern physics probably Harris modern physics.

Though keep in mind that most of quantum is applications of linear algebra and differential equations so it might seem drudgey if don't like math. Unless of course the math part fun for you then quantum is really interesting.
You need to get as much practice solving **problems** as you can.

Beyond that, it depends on how deep into the rabbit hole you'd like to go.

There are plenty of great textbook recommendations here, so I won't add even more to the list, but I'd say you should have a look in the library and flick through a few texts. Most will cover similar material, and you can look at the contents to get an idea of similarities. 
The issue is, textbooks can *occasionally* substitute a decent lecture course (I say occasionally because they often omit the useful analogies and explanations that a lecturer can offer), but if you want to get a solid understanding you need to practice problems.

I don't know what kind of maths background you have, but you may find it useful to invest in a mathematics for physicists textbook. Something which covers matrices & linear algebra, vector calculus and 1st-2nd order differential equations should do you well. In my experience the key to understanding comes from having a thorough intuition of the underlying maths, which will help to further solidify the physical models you develop in your head. This, like most things, comes with practice (in the form of problems).

Hope this helps! Good luck with your journey.
Fredrich Schuller has a couple of excellent video lecture series on youtube. Here's a link to his lectures on quantum theory:

Lectures on Quantum Theory: 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxQVx5jRjbfRGEzWY_upS5K6

I found them to be very thorough and enlightening, I hope you find the same :)
In order to properly understand those subjects you're going to need to understand the math behind them too
Griffiths can't be beaten for undergrad quantum.
Be sure to study linear algebra and ODE really thoroughly and you'll have enough of a foundation to pick up the rest with hard work. 
There are intro quantum mechanics courses for free from MIT. Definitely check those out.
https://youtu.be/sc-uXaXwyuU

This helped me 
As long as you have a good foundation on classical mechanics (which I assume you do having an ME minor) and statistics, I'm sure you could self teach yourself the fundamentals to QM.
Lots of great answers in this thread. If you want a simpler approach to modern physics first, which I would highly recommend before diving deeper, Taylor's Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers was a great mid-level undergraduate textbook before moving on to upper level books like Griffith's or the like. I believe Taylor is more known for his upper level classical mechanics book but I think it's a great opening if you've already had introductory physics, which it sounds like you have.

I actually learned upper-level quantum not from Griffith's but from Townsend's A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics. However, I did have to read it on my own. I found it approachable with the background knowledge of Taylor's book though I did also formally have other upper-level classes which I think helped from a mathematics perspective.
Yes...if you have a bad enough professor haha
(1/sqrt(2))(|y>+exp(i\*phi)|n>)
Susskind's 'Theoretical Minimum' would be a great start.
One thing which no one has mentioned yet: A decent understanding of vector calculus, differential equations and linear algebra will make a lot of QM make sense.

Khan academy will get you up to date on all that. Griffiths is the best undergrad textbook, schaurms QM for practice questions. MIT open course ware if you need lectures. 
Knight's intro physics book provides a really good transition from classical to modern physics, IMO. It's the book we used in phys 1 and 2 and modern 1, and although I went to class almost every time, most of my learning was done in my own time with this book. Read every letter on every page and do every example, going back after each section or chapter to redo the examples to make sure the info sticks, and you will be bueno. 
I'd like to hitch-hike OP's thread. I hope he doesn't mind.

I come from similar background to OP, and wish to understand BCS theory (I heard that it is a beautiful theory). Can anyone recommend good textbooks? 
Sure it's possible, but if you have a job and a life on the side it will take a lot of time and effort.

I recommend that you start with Roger Penrose's "The Road to Reality" and work your way from there. Take Susskind's Theoretical Minimum video courses (+ 2 books). And of course you should have Feynman's Lectures on Physics.
MIT, Yale, and Stanford have lectures on youtube. I am actually currently watching the MIT quantum physics lectures now and it is blowing my mind. If you go into the description of the video, there's a link to the course website where you can download the lecture notes and problem sets with solutions. 

I also recommend a book called Quarks: The Stuff of Matter by Herald Fritzsch. It is old but it was a great intro for me to quarks and how color charge works. It's more of a qualitative book, so there isn't any math.
I hope this comment helps you jump from just the introduction to further afield.

The real question here I think is what you want to know from quantum mechanics. Other users have given good recommendations for books that introduce you to quantum mechanics, however a lot of people ask me either about: Particle/String theory or Teleportation/Entanglement which I can answer pretty well on. Someone asked me last week about black holes which I could give pretty good information about but I'm generally not an astronomy person but do cosmology. 

Once you have an understanding up until you can understand Dirac notation and have learnt things such as operator usage, commutators, state transition probability (and thus perturbation theory), then you can go into more specific branches. These topics should be in any quantum intro book.

For entanglement and all the cool applicable to 'every day life' stuff, which I'm sure an engineer would love, I recommend taking up study in "quantum information theory" (QIT), which kind of follows from quantum optics. QIT includes entanglement experiments and locality arguments, answers to the nature of a quantum state, quantum computational algorithms, y'know, cool sounding, applicable to technology advancements, "every day" physics. **NOTE: Some quantum optics books like the one by Mark Fox does teach relevant intro quantum mechanics at the start and teaches some QIT at the end, I highly recommend this for a jump start!**

One branch that will be incredibly hard to get anything from (but not impossible) is Particle physics. There will be a point after studying an introductional book where you can say "I know what experiments are doing exactly" but cannot understand the full mechanisms involved in experiments, and that theoretical particle is a long way off and would require a lot of study. This won't be worth your time unless you really want to go into these fields. You can find a book aimed at public to break down some notions of String theory, but I have seen quite a few people going for ridiculous lying sensationalist books, so I dont recommend this route unless written by someone well established.

Astrophysics is a cool field but I just don't enjoy studying it, my friend shows me a good image they got of a star and explain how they measured various aspects of it like age, temp, distance etc, I just think "cool, problem solved, no further questions". I only like to know how high density entities like black holes and neutron stars work. Anyway, as far as I'm aware, you just have to understand from quantum mechanics why energy is required for: electron orbital jumps, electrons freeing themselves from atoms, electron bonding (maybe), atomic fusion, and maybe some other mechanisms. But it shouldn't be too hard, I learnt all I needed to pre-university even before I knew quantum mechanics mathematics.

EDIT: Some other major fields are -quantum solid state (like crystals and semiconductors and superconductors), quantum statistical mechanics (and non-equilibrium mechanics builds on this. Basically describes gases, in experiment ultra cold gases, but also can apply to black holes and maybe electron transport), physics related philosophy (strong relations to information theory on the nature of quantum states and the universe), chemistry, and quantum biology.

Super conductors are cool (get it?) but the theoretical side of it is confusing and requires devotion like theoretical particle physics. I did a course at uni (semi and super conductrs) and that is enough for me. I like to check in every now and then and see how hot we can get a super conductor.
Has anyone used "older" books such as Schrodinger, Neumann, Dirac, etc.?  From my experience with mathematics books, I have an impression that older books can provide a lot of useful insights that more modern books do not have, on a condition that the reader is planned to read advanced books after reading those older books.  

Sure. Pick up a copy of EM griffiths Classical mechanics goldstein and QM Shankar. 

Shakars QM is really great and self contained. 
If in your engineering preparation you already have a good/decent knowledge of algebra, geometry, calcolus and classical physics, your're good to go for introduction tests in quantum mechanics and special relativity.
Whatever textbook/resource you end of using, do all the practice problems you can! When self learning it is easy to dismiss the need for practice and overestimate your abilities. 

I love self-learning. I was able to learn and get credit for university calculus, physics, chemistry.
Yes I do. Thanks!
Great comment. Just what I needed! Yeah I really want to learn that may be applicable for engineers too! Thanks!
Quantum Mechanics: Everything You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics by Leonard Susskind and some other guy. Great resource, not afraid of math.
I am a physics undergraduate at one of the top universities in the world. Some of our lecturers are fantastic,  and make a real difference when learning. Some are simply reading the notes ver batam, and they get confused and lost while teaching, which doesn't help us at all. For the latter we are essentially forced to teach ourselves or teach each other. Luckily, the aforementioned notes are very comprehensive, so teaching ourselves is no issue. You absolutely can learn modern physics,  including quantum physics, all by yourself so long as you have good resources available. Just expect it to take a while to grasp; Even with this formal education some stuff only clicks a long time after I have sat the exams. The trickiest aspect is learning that you can always go deeper,  and thus into more complicated territory. The problems we study are very much simplified versions of how the world works. It is only when we have a solid foundation do we move onto harder (and so usually more realistic) problems. Also expect there to be several different ways of looking at the same problem. 

I could go on and on. 
Nah.
You should star by reading "Quantum Electro Dynamics" by Richard Feynman. It is an excelent starting point for Quantum Physics
Yes.  But forget about everything else and hone in on that narrow subject...and then get diagnosed with Aspergers.
The problem would be that planets are moving with respect to each other, so a kind of transportation that is fixed in position, as the hyper loop would be, would be really impractical. One moment you will be flying to mars, some time later and you would be in the midle of nowhere.
What does that even mean?
As has been said, you could but then every trajectory has to "thread the needle".  Like, if you're going from the Earth to Mars, the exact second you leave would have sufficient effect on your trajectory so that you would miss such a thing if you were a second later and, of course, for a second person to use that thing the chances of there being another Earth to Mars trajectory that threads that exact spot at any later date are probably mathematically zero.

On top of this, once you've gone through your trajectory will entirely change because your speed has increased, which means to hit your destination the initial trajectory had to be a "wrong" one and only after the boost are you on the "right" one.  This means if you should miss that thing you're basically screwed and just going off into space.
Shots fired at the biologists!
Did they just wait for the Nobel prize to be award it and then award it for the same thing? Something similar happened last year when the "Fundamental Physics Prize" went to several neutrino researchers.
Start by looking at existing programs that do this.  Some examples:

Using Finite-Difference Time Domain: Meep

Using Finite Element Method: COMSOL, HFSS, CST
You want a finite difference time domain code - see the book by Taflove. See my app called 'WiFi Solver' for a fun application of FDTD.
How about [helmhurts](https://jasmcole.com/2014/08/25/helmhurts/)
Maybe you are interested in writing a ray-tracer?
I would also recommend you take a look at Lumerical FDTD
Schutz and Carroll are the more beginner friendly books, I'd recommend you start with those and then see what you want.
I'm gonna recommend Carroll for a more physicsy approach. O'Neill is great, but might be overkill for a first round. Carroll follows along very similar to Wald so the two of them complement each other very well. 

Another absolutely fantastic book, is Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell by A. Zee. I can't recommend it enough, it's new and is as up to date as you can expect. It is extremely accessible, all the while not dumbing it down either. As a consequence, it's a 800+ page nutshell, so there is that. 

Finally, Perimeter Scholars International has a few really good lectures series' on the subject, I'll try and remember to post a link later when I'm at a computer. (or just Google PSI lectures) 


Edit: here is the link 

https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/training/perimeter-scholars-international/psi-lectures

Personally, I really liked Neil Toruk's lecture series from 2015, but check them all out 
Do you have PDE background?
We used "An introduction to tensor calculus and relativity" by Lawden in class and I'd recommend it. 
For more intuitive SR + GR (without EM): Hartle - Gravity

For a mathematical, terse, Russian-approach, SR + EM + GR: Landau & Lifshitz - The Classical Theory of Fields

To be honest I'm not really sure how Landau & Lifshitz covers so much content in such a thin book, but they do...and quite well (if you can follow their explanations)
Uhh well talk about providence ... look into the calculation for the [critical number of dimensions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_dimension) needed to cancel anomalies in bosonic string theory (which happens to be 26).  I don't know the equations myself and I am sure they are very complicated but it's exactly what you're looking for.  Maybe someone can post it for you or you can find it with a Google search.

Nice Article!
At Oxford, there's an entrance examination (the PAT) which (combined with the interview) determines whether you get a place. For scholarships, look at https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/fees-and-funding/oxford-support?wssl=1.
I would go for Newton's first law. The idea that an object will continue to move forever if no force acts on it.

There is a nice thought experiment, I think Galilei used it first, that explains it. The [Wikipedia page on inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia) is a good start.
I know this doesn't quite answer your question, but when I was about 13, I was fascinated by the *Uncle Albert* books by Russell Stannard, which tried to introduce a number of important concepts in physics to young people without maths, including some aspects of advanced subjects like relativity and quantum physics. 

I know the kids you are talking about are slightly younger, but I believe the books are read by kids of that age too. Once they have read one of the 'main' ones, like *Time and Space of Uncle Albert*, they can also check out *Letters to Uncle Albert*, which are filled with hand-written questions about physics and science sent from children to the Albert character, with his answers (really Stannard's answers of course). I highly recommend them.
> what are some underlying concepts of physics?

The idea that everything in the universe behaves in a way that we can describe it with a (small) set of laws.

And while this is beyond the scope of the children education, I would like to highlight it: We have a set of laws that describes all properties of all particles relevant for our life (within the current experimental precision). No experiment ever performed found a clear deviation. And it's not like no one would have tried - thousands of experiments have been performed to test the theories with ever increasing precision. Some things are measured more precisely than one part in a trillion.

Concerning the other questions: Newton's laws can be understood without formulas, and demonstrated easily. They are also easy to link to everyday life.
Newton's third law became heavily abused by new age "thinkers" to give birth to the concept of the law of attraction.
One book on the subject of physics that I quite liked when I was young was [The Physics Of Superheroes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OCXHPO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).

 In it the author looks at many different super heroes and provides them with one "miracle exception" to physics (e.g. the Flash can run really fast, Spiderman can somehow produce spider webs, etc), and then talks about the physics involved with some of the acts performed by those heroes.
my dad is a physicist by profession, specialized in optics, and he's been fully emploed/seeked-after-by-recruiters since his graduation. it's still a highly expanding area, limited by our materials sciences and engineering technology. but they're growing side-by-side, and still pushing new frontiers on a daily basis. 
particle accelerators, fusion/plasma, detectors/sensors(self driving cars, drones)... def one of coolest areas :)

it's not about which fields offer the most, it's about where YOU can apply yourself best.
https://cymercareers.com/
The EUV lithography machines that ASML are building are fully working on laser and plasma physics so I think there will be a lot of job opertunities there in the future. For the rest I think that a lot of plasma physics is focused at making fusion reactors. And a lot of money is put in that field.

What's the deal with Planck's (non-reduced constant)? I've never used h instead of hbar except like in one undergrad lab and some earlier meaningless "E=hf" calculations. Is it just a historical accident that h gets called Planck's constant instead of hbar?
Are there any actually useful applications of AdS/CFT to condensed matter physics? Does anyone know what the field looks like in its current state?
Do you think there are any more basic simple "laws" that have yet to be discovered, or have we pretty much discovered everything in the universe that's like that?

e.g. f = ma, v = ir, pv = nrt, etc.
Why are photons emitted when electrons move from higher to lower energy levels? Is there a fundamental reason why the excess energy couldn't be released as, say, neutrinos instead?
Why can't we calculate Schrödinger equation for more complicated atoms than hydrogen, or molecules? What would be the consequences if we could?


           
Trying to turn the action variable of an elliptical orbit into the area of the orbit, question is given in x but I'm not sure what the orbit parameters (energy turning points etc.) look like in x coordinates, everywhere I have seen it in terms of r, if anyone can help it'd be appreciated!
The daytime side of the Earth is closer to the sun than the nighttime side.  It is therefore experiencing more gravity.  Does this have any noticeable effect on the Earth?
If two non-symmetrical objects collide in zero G vacuum, what principle determines how the linear and angular momenta get redistributed? i.e. how much goes into spinning, and how much goes into 'knocking'. Is it net conserved linear and angular momenta of the combined system?
Along the same line of thought that: The length of an object parallel to the direction of movement shortens as u --> C. 

Is it flawed logic to associate that to the expansion of the universe? 

Could the expansion of the universe be cause by the universe as a whole slowing down as seen from a different reference frame? 

And would an object appear 2 dimensional if it was able to reach the speed of light?

Am I just stupid and have no idea what I am even asking?
Does anyone have any good "recent" resources on formation and evolution of cosmic string networks? It seems like everything I can find is from the 80's (work by Kibble, Turok, Vilenkin, etc.) and while it certainly seems like good work, I'm just wondering if there have been any advances in the field. Perhaps a good review article?
Can't we measure quantum-sized stuff with something else other than electrons? Why don't we make instruments that measure interaction via strong or weak force, for example? Will the recent discovery of gravitational waves help us unlock the mysteries of quantum physics?
From what I understand about quantum field theory, the waves in the quantum field (not sure what the actual name is) oscillate back and forth and if they reach a certain amplitude, a particle is born. So when it talks about reaching a certain amplitude, is this reached by constructive interference between the waves, or do the waves not interfere at all and particles keep popping back into existence once per period?  Also, could it be possible that anti particles could just be negative displacements?
How can light carry momentum? If p=mv then both mass and velocity are required so how can a particle that travels at the speed of light with zero mass (the photon) carry momentum? 

I double majored in physics and chemistry in undergrad. I didn't take the astronomy/astrophysics units though because that's a different major at my uni. From what I can tell, as a physics grad there are two options; coding/theoretical or instrumentation/experimental. 

I have worked as an instrumental physicist in both commercial and research labs. I found this to be very rewarding as the "feedback" on your work is close to instantaneous and funding for your position and your work is pretty solid because they won't hire you if they don't need you. I am now doing my PhD in applied physics and in some ways it's much harder without those instant results. There's a lot of waiting and banging your head against a wall, particularly with the coding portion. It's awesome when you get it to work though.

Strangely, the theoretical side of physics is where all the money is in physics research in my country. That's on your side for astronomy though because that's mostly computational based from what I've seen.

I don't have any experience with aeronautics but feel free to ask me any questions you have about a base physics program.
Determine if your interest in physics/astrophysics is more of a hobby or a lifelong passion. I thought astrophysics was my passion starting my physics B.S. and now that I have taken my astro courses and am graduating in a few months I wish I majored in engineering-- I want a job without having to do 4-5 more years of school. 
Professional astrophysicist here. 

A career as a research scientist either at a university or a research institute involves not only a bachelors, masters and PhD but involves loving the doctorate so much that you effectively just keep on doing doctorates over and over again. Of course once you have your phd you don't need to do another one but post docs and research positions are the same bread and butter as a phd. You just do it faster and better as you become more experienced. 

There are loads of careers that like astrophysics phds. Our students are very employable often in highly paid jobs - much higher paid than research. From meteorology and data science, to coding and super computing, from computer modeling and visualizations to business consulting and quants. Everyone wants a "number guy" who knows statistics and modeling as well as project management and some of the highest levels of mathematical acumen in society. 
You'll only get work if you get a PhD. So, focus on that first.
Erin?
Interesting typo.
This is certainly all true, but so is what *I* have been telling people who ask me this for years. Which is just that the 2nd law of thermodynamics only applies to open systems. (And, in more detail, that open systems that can be worked on by other systems will *often* experience a reduction in entropy, life or no life, and so on...)
A God explanation???

And why did I stay up all night wondering if there was a dog?
Life violates the 2nd law in spirit. But in absolute terms, ha no.
Here's the pre-print on the arxiv, https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08684
"quantum memories"? Isn't that what (tunnel on-tunnel off, or at least tunnel off) solid state memory is?  Or what about magnetic hard-drives?  Is electric-read Giant Magneto-Resistance not sufficiently quantum mechanical?  What if we have electric-write with Spin Torque Transfer (STT)?
>like books you would read when taking a course at college.

Susskind's lectures are very nice but they're not at all at the level of an undergraduate course on the same topic.  If I recalk, Susskind tries to keep everything confined to algebra and simple 1d calculus and makes no attempt to teach "problem solving" ability.  Conversely, a university book, like any of Griffith's books, is intended to make sure the student can solve problems.

With that in mind, Feynman's lecture s might be a good fit if you're keeping up with Susskind's stuff.
There's a misleading part with the soccer ball/photon explanation. You'd still see a diffraction pattern with only one slit using photons, as long as the slit is small enough.
That was pretty good.  You covered a lot of ground.  Good job.
i recommend against "read and highlight". you don't highlight "important stuff" in physics textbooks. it's all important facts. the density of information is very high. 

you should read and work through each chapter, trying to follow the individual steps (say by doing them on a blank sheet of paper) and doing the exercises at the end of the chapter.

you should also do a summary at the end of a chapter (the core concepts that have been introduced in the chapter / important calculations that have been done / important facts that have been derived from the theory / basic assumptions of models).

if they are your books you can add notes into the books, some thoughts that you came up with while trying to follow the steps, so if you reread it you have it there.
>by just reading it and probably highlight some important parts. 

No.  You will never learn physics like this.  Read the chapters and then do every single practice problem at the back. Practice. Practice. Practice.  That's the only way you learn.  You may read a chapter and think "ok, I got that" but it won't stick and when you need to use it, you won't be able to.

In addition, I do find writing out my own set of notes that try and explain the concepts to a fictitious third party to be very helpful for my understanding.
Pics or it didnt happen
If anyone finds the time-lapse video mentioned please share!
damn i work just down the hall from this lab!! nice to see its getting a little attention.
So you mean the 3d movment of electron in thinfilms are found 
Filters that allow a narrow band of wavelength to pass are called bandpass filters.

Eg. https://www.newport.com/f/bandpass-filters
[Edmund Optics](http://www.edmundoptics.com/optics/optical-filters/bandpass-filters/deep-uv-bandpass-filters/3715/#f=categories_s|*C41I*,productId_i|3715,27587_s|%3C%20300) has some real deep UV bandpass filters. Seems to be made of MgF2 and fused silica. 

If you're looking for anything broadband like 10-300 nm bandpass filters, you're absolutely not going to find them unless you know e-beam lithography and can fabricate a structure yourself that'll allow for strong UV transmittance. 
Everything here seems pretty standard except for that two photon absorption business.  I would have thought that the absorption rate would be prohibitively low for this to work.  Pretty cool stuff.
Found this amazing series and just really wanted to share it. This guy is so incredibly lucid and clear. 
Awesome, as an undergrad with an interest to pursue research in Quantum Computation this will surely help me learn more about the theory. Thanks for sharing!
His book "Fabric of Reality" discusses this among other things, strongly recommend it if you find these talks interesting.
Omg. Have you ever heard of youtube? It works very well on all kinds of devices!
Working on passing my physics class. 
Conquering the physics GRE and crippling self-doubt.
Working on a new experiment. We're hoping to showcase a new technique for improving the fidelity (quality) of entanglement gates between two ions.
Working on a research poster. It's going alright.

Working on developing relationships with my CC professors so I can maybe get a recommendation for an internship over the summer. Advice?


However, if I don't get an internship, I'm going to backpack across the US because why not.
I'm reviewing for the general GRE that I'm taking later this week. I also have to study more for the physics GRE, finish 3 homework assignments, write a poster, apply to travel grants for a conference, study for an upcoming QMII test, and also do my research (and apply to grad programs). 

I feel like I'm not good enough for this, even though evidence says otherwise. I also haven't had time to see my best friends in over a month. I just feel a little overwhelmed at the moment; no matter how much I do, I still have 1000 more things to do. 

Thanks for reading my rant. :) 
Just finished responding to a referee's comments on what will soon be my first publication. About to start looking into undergrad research/internships I can get over the summer, probably through SPS
I'll admit up front I'm not too familiar with Khan academy, but on the few occasions I've stumbled onto lectures on youtube it seemed very much like a "kumon" type deal (i.e. emphasis on wrote repetition instead of concepts and understanding).  Thus it seems more aimed at making someone who does well at solving homework problems and thus doing well in a course.  

If your interest is more of a hobby, this is probably not what you really want.  Do you have any math background?  People seem to like Leonard Susskind's "Theoretical Minimum" lectures.
I'll mention "the mechanical universe" primarily for the reason that its level of awesomeness is disproportionate to the level of popularity. It is rarely ever mentioned.
I've never been really into the whole video lecture thing so I can't advise you there, but Feynman Lectures are free online and are very interesting. They are not, in my opinion, a great first text, and are much better to read after you have some basic understanding of the material as Feynman's take on subjects is sometimes unorthodox and leads to many Eureka moments if you understand the underlying physics well, but are just confusing if you don't already understand at least somewhat.
Everyone learns in different ways. For me, video lectures were only helpful in clarifying concepts I was confused about. For actually learning the material, I always found reading about the concepts then solving problems to be the best tactic. That might not be the case for you and you may have to try a few different approaches until you find one you like. 

If you are like me and learn best by solving problems then I would suggest just going out and buying a Physics textbook or a review book. I never took AP Physics C but in my senior year of high school I would try to spend some time every day going through the review book for it that I bought.

Best of luck!

P.S. - Everyone on this forum is going to recommend you the Feynman Lectures on Physics. They are definitely worth buying and are beautifully written and presented. However, I did not find them to be a great introductory resource. Wait until you are somewhat familiar with the concepts in the book then read about them for a more intuitive understanding.

Yep, sound experimental thinking and apparatus.... right up until that dark-magic-vernier-calculator(!)
>In May, new ITER chief Bernard Bigot - former head of French nuclear state agency CEAFo

For Bernard's sake I hope ITER never has any sort of discrimination scandal. The headlines really write themselves.

20 billion euros is still a lot less than germany alone spend for solar subsidies. so the price shouldn't be mentioned at all. (but even with the wendelstein 7-x which cost 1 billion euros over 20 years, some anti-nuclear greens have come forward quoting its "immense price")
What a boondoggle. 

Politics has made this project a fucking joke. 
 > "For the first time, we have a reliable estimate ... In the past there was no realistic schedule, no detailed appreciation of the cost said Bigot...

If the partner countries funded the project with billions of euros and "no realistic schedule" or cost analysis years ago, then we should all doubt they have a "reliable estimate" today.

But maybe I'm too cynical.
I wasn't aware anyone was still trying for a large-scale Tokamak reactor.  Isn't the stellarator design supposed to be a much more promising research avenue?
ITER was a fucking disaster from the get go.  It's such a huge waste of money.  There are better ideas around that cost far less, and don't need a ton of different countries to cooperate to build.
Does anyone else find it strange that they're building this in south France but France isn't one of the 7 partners?
Oh yeah, it's *that* article!

It's a disaster and shouldn't even have published. The journal rightfully backtracked because they realized they made an obvious mistake publishing it. They very likely were confused by the completely unnecessary general relativistic smoke screen - at the heart of this is a really elementary mistake the author is taking years to recognize as such.

Luboš Motl is pretty much spot on about this btw, but since he's a nazi douche I won't link to his blog.

While I agree sometimes the standards for peer review are... suboptimal, expecting *no* mistakes to be ever made is unrealistic. One should always keep in mind the sheer amount of crackpot or simply wrong papers that are successfully blocked by the system so as to place this kind of cases in perspective.
> After our editorial meeting, we have concluded that your result is in obvious conflict with a proven scientific fact, i.e., violation of local realism that has been demonstrated not only theoretically but experimentally in recent experiments, and thus your result could not be generally accepted by the physics community. On this basis, we have made such a decision to withdraw your paper. 

I was a bit confused by the double negative here but if did I understand it correctly that if this review statement is true, then this paper would imply local realism? And based on the linked PubBeer threads, the paper is quite open about disproving Bell's theorem and contains elementary mathematical mistakes. How did that get published in the first place? What kind of a reviewer wouldn't require this kind of paper to be of very high standard and very explicit about its consequences, _and double check the mathematics_? Smells fishy...

If this is indeed the case, some serious errors have happened in the peer review process, and I do agree with retracting this paper. But obviously the author should be alerted of this beforehand and the retraction should be done and explained more carefully.
The "Einstein Centre for Local-Realistic Physics in Oxford, UK" sounds like it is fringe science-related.



These publishers provide extremely little utility to the scientific community, while siphoning away buckets of cash. 
I have never submitted a paper to an Elsevier journal but I get the impression that they don't have a very rigorous peer review process.

What exactly is spin at the quantum level. The article says

> So in quantum physics there is a related notion and that goes by 
> the name of spin except that in quantum physics spin is fixed to a 
> particular value. 

Does the particle actually rotate? Are the rotational positions quantized? Are the different spin numbers related to the speed of rotation? If the spin is 1, does the particle snap to its next position 360 degrees from its current position? How would you detect any rotation at all in this case?

If spin has nothing to do with particle rotation, then what exactly is its physical manifestation? 

(Note that I have no problem understanding rotation in more than 3 physical dimension.)
Have you contact the physics department of your local university? They usually have somebody who can help with these kind of things. When it is for high school (which I assume) they're usually able to help.
Can you say a bit more about what you actually need to demonstrate? Like, do you have a material you want to see an MCE in, or do you need to build some sort of actual device? What equipment and/or facilities do you have access to?
The wavefunction's derivative can have discontinuities if the potential has Dirac deltas for example. It's easy to see from Schrödinger's equation: if the potential has a Dirac, then so does the second derivative of the wavefunction, and hence the first derivative must have a discontinuity.

However, you're asking about changing the sign at a node, in which case you're assuming that we're at a point where the wavefunction is zero. In this special case, it turns out that the derivative must be continuous even at a Dirac delta. More precisely, the discontinuity of the derivative at a delta function is proportional to the value of the wavefunction there. So if the value is zero, so is the discontinuity.

In more regular potentials, with no Diracs, hard walls, and so on, the wavefunction's derivative must be continuous. It can be seen from the Schrödinger equation and thinking about how each terms (wavefunction, its second derivative and the potential) must fit together for regularity.
The answer you are looking for is a mathematical one. A wave function is a solution to a second order differential equation.

A function that has the same sign on both sides of the nodes necessarily has a vanishing derivative therein.

Now, the node is a zero of the wavefunction, and hence the wavefunction as well as its derivative then would vanish at the node.

Being the solution to a second order differential equation means the solution is unique if you fix the value of the function as well as the value of its derivative at a single! point.

Now, there is a solution with f(node)=f'(node)=0, it is f(x)=0 for all x. Uniqueness then implies that your wavefunction must be zero already, hence, a non zero wavefunction must change sign at a node.
My gut feeling tells me it is a consequence of smoothness of wavefunctions. I remember that the first few derivatives must be smooth for a wavefunction to be a solution to a wave equation. 
Think the time dependent Schrödinger equation can be interpreted as such. But take it with a lot of salt. I am not a theoretician...
You didn't say "energy eigenstate."  So long as you can decompose it into a basis of energy eigenstates you can have any wavefunction you care to draw.
The energy of light is tied to the frequency, and energy must be conserved, so there are limited shifts that can happen.

[Photon upconversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_upconversion) involves the absorption of two photons. Then, a photon with a frequency equal to the sum of the absorbed photon frequencies is emitted.

Something similar can happen with [Spontaneous parametric down-conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion). A photon can be essentially split by a material into two photons whose energies add up to the incident photon. It's interesting that you mentioned keeping the momentum of the photons. Because, both energy an momentum have to be conserved, down-converted photons depart at an angle from each-other. Calculating the angles relative to the incident pathline as a function of the ratio of energies makes for a good homework problem.

The most broad phenomenon is [fluorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence). There's all sorts of interesting behavior there. Fluorescence allows the construction of lasers at a much broader range of frequencies than lasing mediums would allow. Read up on [Dye lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye_laser).
There are a variety of nonlinear optical effects that can be used to broaden and compress the bandwidth of a laser pulse (self-phase modulation, etc.).  There are also nonlinear optical effects that can be used to shift the entire spectrum of light to a new frequency altogether (nonlinear optical harmonic generation and parametric amplification). These processes typically require that the light be very intense (i.e. an ultrashort laser pulse with intensities ~ GW/cm^2).  There is a whole field of research, however, devoted to developing materials that exhibit nonlinear optical effects with low light intensity as well (towards single photon nonlinear optics).  

Of course a simple filter or combination of filters is a really great way to "shrink" a spectrum of light.  A good example is tinted sunglasses. 
> A material that could taken in light at a certain energy level, alter it and then emit it in the same direction as it approached?

Some materials can double the frequency of the light passing through them, for example this is how green laser pointers work ([technical description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-harmonic_generation)).

The effect can be gotten only under very specific circumstances. It doesn't work for a wide range of wavelengths, or if an optically coherent wavefront is required.
I don't know enough about optics and this sort of thing to say it is possible or not, but I am fairly confident everything would looks the same pretty much 
Turns out, it much more complicated than just angular momentum conservation. Mostly, we don't really know how it works.

I have always thought about it this way: when the bike is still, as you loose your balance where does the front wheel go? No where, nothing compensates the force of gravity pulling you down. 

When you are moving and you start to loose your balance where does the front wheel go? You instinctively turn it slightly. This effectively compensates for the force of gravity pulling you down. Have you noticed that when you are turning on a bike you lean? This means that throughout the turn the force that the ground is exerting on the wheels is creating a centripetal acceleration that is both changing your direction and fighting the force of gravity that is pulling you down.

Basically I have always thought of it that the force of gravity that pulls you down is comoensated for by the centripetal acceleration when you turn. A movig bicycle offers a means of correcting balance that a stationary bicycle does not.

Notice how when yoh are barely moving and trying to balance your turns get more extreme? This is because at slower speeds more extreme turns are required to generate the neccesary counteracting centripetal acceleration.

Edit: leaning into the turn helps channel some of the force the ground is exerting on the wheels in a turn to fighting gravity.
It has to do with conservation of angular momentum.

Even as an undergrad physics student, you will have to write papers documenting experiments done in your lab classes. If you want to be a physicist you'll need a PhD, which means you'll have to write a thesis, which are commonly hundreds of pages long. And that's not counting the papers you'll be required to publish, or the grant proposals (as you mention) you have to write to get funding. All of this only continues if you become a professor. A huge part of doing science is participating in the scientific community, and you can't do that if you can't write to express your ideas and experiments.

I found growing up that I also hated writing book reports. I thought I hated writing too, but it turns out I just hated writing about books! When I got the chance to write about science, I loved it. You may find the same is true for you. Writing is just a way of communicating. Don't give up on it yet!
It should be noted that writing essays is different to writing reports/theses. While there are some similarities, I find writing reports more interesting
There is a lot of writing, but don't despair.

I also really hated writing essays for books in english class, technical writing is not the same thing. You need some of the basic skills, like narrative flow, organization, and stuff like that, so don't ignore English class; but you don't need to be subjective, vague, or 'fill up a page' to get the length required for an assignment. 

Instead, you get to write what you want, as eloquently and succinctly as you can, while doing awesome science.

Remember: Most research is paid for by public funding in one way or another. This means, you (or someone on your behalf) needs to be able to effectively communicate to the public (or just less technical people than you) in order to continue your work. Hang in there.
>  Is this true that there is a lot of writing in physics, or is it false?

100% true, but the writing is absolutely nothing like the book reports and five paragraph essays they make you write in high school and before. There are seldom mandatory word counts or page lengths, and you don't need to (and it's typically actively discouraged) add vague fluff to make your work a certain length. Concision is desired; rambling is not.
I worked in 'commercial' science for many years, even though we were doing fundamental research (organic photovoltaics), we spend our time, conducting experiments and test, building and designing instruments, writing software, designing electronics, meetings, and yes sometimes writing papers, reports, result analysis, patent applications. 

this is very different from the academic route, where you have pressures to publish (publish or perish) and hunting for tenure or your next grant. I would say there are far more people with physics degrees or PhD's working in science for industry than there is in science for academia. 
Communication is fundamental to any professional career. If you don't develop a full mastery of the English language you won't succeed as a scientist.
To add to what has already been said (and be sort of off-topic), it sounds like you aren't in college yet which leads me to think that you probably hate writing about books because of the way you've been taught to think and write. I used to feel the same way but after taking a 101 college writing course and tutoring for that course for 2.5 years, I realized that writing is much more about critical thinking than anything else. Unfortunately, most high schools don't teach this.

Most high schools also encourage a divide between those who are good at writing, history, etc (non-STEM subjects) and those who are good at math and science (STEM subjects) because of the way those subjects are tested. Beyond this though, there's no reason you can't be good at both. In fact, if you're good at critical thinking and reasoning, you SHOULD be good at both.

I'm in a PhD program now and can still say that some of the best mental exercises I've gone through have been in writing and literature classes I took where I had to think about extremely complex problems where instead of writing out equations to get an answer, you have to discuss with others, think on your own, and write and rewrite many times before you get to a solution. You'll never get this type of mental stretching in physics but it will undoubtedly make you a better reader, writer, and thinker and thus a better scientist. 
writing a physics paper is really not the same as writing an essay on a random topic. you basically present your own work, not some randomly thought up stuff regarding the interpretation of some piece of literature with a minimum word threshold.
Speaking as a career physicist, your mother is correct. Over the last three decades I have spent almost as much time writing (reports, papers, presentations, proposals, e-mails, reviews, press releases, articles, etc.) as I have doing more technical aspects of my job. It is an unavoidable part of the careers of almost every scientist today.
I also hated writing essays in school, and it's true that you have to do a good amount of writing if you're doing physics. In my experience, the writing isn't that bad though because you're writing about physics. You're explaining/summarizing something you've spent quite a bit of time working on. It's easier to write, in some sense, because it's more straightforward and doesn't require you to analyze one sentence written by someone else and write an entire paper on what you think it means.

I wouldn't worry about it too much. The other good thing about writing in physics is that you don't get assignments that require you to write 10 pages minimum or something like that. If you can write everything you need to in one page, then that's all you need to write.
I studied physics, in part, because I didn't like having to read textbooks much or write essays. If you pay close attention in class and are reasonably smart/willing to work through a lot of problems, you can pull it off. I then went on to get my Ph.D. And continued not having to read or write much for quite a while. There are papers (reading/writing) and, eventually, your thesis, but not too much, really. However, I think it would be kind of absurd to base your career path on that alone. But, who am I to judge?
Undergrad BSc Physics, 12000 word dissertation and 8000 word project report in final year along with 2 ~2000-4000 word lab reports each semester. On top of that a few modules had essays for each topic.

That said, a book report and technical writing are completely different in terms of language used, so don't even think they are anywhere close to similar. 
A general hint for writing: Please choose a title that describes the actual contents. If your title was "Is this true that there is a lot of writing in physics?", everyone would know that it is a general question for physicists. The benefit would be that people who think they have something to say would spot the title and open this thread and answer.
If you're looming into going to college at all then be prepared for a lifetime of papers. If you don't want to write papers then I would suggest getting a career in some trade like welding. 
This is not a new solution. There are a million ways to improve the optics of the solar cell interface (specular reflection is another loss mechanism). The problem with all of them is the additional cost of fabricating these structures far exceeds the gain in efficiency. Right now the contacts are screen printed over large area. How would you  be able to make non-planar, triangular cross section low index material on top of the contacts over square meters of panel cheaply and efficiently?
Clever idea.  It's a nice way of avoiding the usual tradeoff between optical efficiency and wire density.  Also it could be a more significant issue for use in solar-concentrating photovoltaics where current density is higher.  

Apparently this science thread is overrun with engineers (including me, haha) but we ought to have some appreciation for theoretical physics even if it isn't directly applicable, because it did provide a solution to a technical problem and maybe the solution will inspire a practical design for manufacture.  For example, maybe a lens or diffraction grating or other optics could be fabricated into the surface-encapsulant to get a similar effect.  Or maybe someone will think of a way to build optics on top of a wire contact, perhaps by using the electrical properties of the wire.  

edit: you guys might not realize that if it weren't for this issue of wires being opaque, designs would use a higher wire density, because it reduces electrical resistance so it is more efficient.
Sounds like a smart solution! I wouldn't have guessed that the metal contacts need to take up any of the light collecting surface area. Why aren't they all on the back side?
Coming soon to a Buzzfeed article near you:

"OMFG!! This one simple trick will revolutionize the way we use solar cells! MUCH WOW!!"
["The exact shape is still a matter of debate in physical cosmology, but experimental data from various, independent sources (WMAP, BOOMERanG and Planck for example) confirm that the observable universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe)
The evidence is rather good at present. It goes like this -- decades ago there was a debate about whether the universe was positively curved (like a sphere), negatively curved (like a saddle) or flat. As time has passed, evidence has accumulated suggesting that the universe has no curvature at all.

What is the connection between zero curvature and an infinite universe? Let me answer with an example -- the surface of a sphere. Imagine that we live in a two-dimensional world called "flatland" that is on the surface of a sphere. The flatlanders want to know how big their universe is, so they try to measure the curvature of the surface around them. To their surprise, they discover the surface is perfectly flat, no measurable curvature at all. So they conclude that their universe is infinite in size.

How did the flatlanders draw that conclusion, based only on their curvature measurement? Think really hard -- ask yourself what the radius is of a sphere whose surface is perfectly flat.

Our cosmological measurements in four dimensions produced the same result, and the same conclusion.
Heh, it's really impossible to know. The connection between curvature and finiteness only works if homogeneity holds up to arbitrarily large scales, which might as well be false.
Looks like our universe is flat.  If it's finite it can't be isotropic, so my bets go to *infinite*.
There is actually a beautiful (albeit purely theoretical and practically useless) connection between finity and signature of the metric. 

Assuming the universe is a semisimple Lie group, the only isotropic and homogeneous solution to Einstein's field equations is the Killing metric.

If you ever wondered why the Minkowski metric has a certain signature, this point of view provides an answer to that (A huge BUT is coming at the end). Compact, i.e. finite dimensions provide each a "+" signature, infinite, timelike dimensions each a "-". Hence, by knowing the signature of our metric (-+++), we'd conclude the universe to be finite in size (i.e. compact).

BUT there is no semisimple Lie group with just one timelike dimension, they all have at least two. Since we only have one timelike dimension, there clearly is something amiss.

Also, people checked for repeating structures we'd see if our universe was indeed finite (Think of a tower of mirrors), none were found.
Not sure what is with these pseudo-philosophical answers. There is no known knowledge to base a probability off of. Infinite is more intuitive, but it by no means has any evidence. 
The universe is flat? Strangest deja vu...
The future headline will be that the universe is infinite, but the material universe is a perpetually growing massive sphere within that infinity. That growing sphere is finite, and the galaxies and universe we see with our telescopes is a tiny spherical glimpse within a narrow band on, as an an analogy, the skin of a basketball. Everything inside the basketball skin would be newer, more condensed matter, expanding out toward us, and everything outside the basketball's skin would be older, more dispersed matter, the skin is perpetually getting larger in volume as it expands out, and our hubble deep field view would consist of approximately one atom of all the atoms in the skin of the baskbatball alone. The thickness of the basketball skin would be about 10 trillion light years thick, on the interior edge of this skin is where new galaxies formulate, on the exterior edge of the skin is where they disintegrate, only inside the skin is where galaxies as we know them exist.

Something cannot come into existence within the context of nothingness - it is a logical paradox, the only rational conclusion is that the universe is infinite in size and duration, but since we know that it is dynamic and not a static continuum at least where we are in the universe, we know that there is some generative process, an algorithm if you like, that is stirring things up. Nothing can kickstart this, because whatever you propose to do it also needs to be explained, therefore the generative processes origin has to be part of the original structure of the universe itself. The only unbiased generative process shape which equally effects all directions is a sphere. There is no reason that there would be a bias (such as a cube shape), generative processes have to work within three-dimensions, anything more or less goes against all experimental observation.

Furthermore, an infinite universe in size and duration also has an infinite generative process, there is no reason for it to stop. There is not a 'big bang' but instead a continual showering of new matter from within the basketball, generated by the core in the center. There is also no such thing as empty void space, it is entirely filled by a fluidic aether which cannot be detected by current equipment because absolutely everything in the universe is made fundamentally of the same stuff. This aether is continually flowing toward the basketball core, from the infinite backdrop of the universe, which will ultimately become particleized matter and reverse direction, away from the core.

To assume that this will all be common knowledge in the future, we can then ask questions like 'could you fly a spaceship to the edge of the universe, and what would happen, would you crash, or would something magical happen like in pac-man when you go off the screen and spawn on the opposite side, or what?' the answer is that as you move away from the skin of the basketball, which represents the material universe, you would eventually reach a point where the spaceship would either disintegrate (in the case of moving away from the core of the basketball too far) or condense on itself, changing the structure of the spaceship into being just a glob of matter (effectively destroying it by transformation), in the case of moving too far toward the core. As you move around in the field of the basketball's core, the ambient density changes, which changes the dynamics of movement as well as the formulation or deconstruction of matter. Even electromagnetic energy would have the same demise, as it too consists of substance, everything is made from the same fundamental building material.
Well everything that we "know" are theories. They could be disproven eventually. We don't know for certain. Also there's much debate still so there's not a definite answer. Depends on who you decide to believe. 
how can you prove that the universe is infinite ? or finite but beyond our observable universe ? if its beyond our reach , how could you measure it ?
you may debate , but never prove it , beyond a mathematical hypothesis ....
I mean, what do you define "infinite?" So large that we'll never be able to fully explore it or even map it within our lifetime? Because that's the reality. Even if it is a "finite" size, it's huge enough that we'll never see all of it, even a small fraction of it.
50/50
If the universe were truly infinite, the night sky wouldn't be dark. The universe is finite yet infinitely expanding.
since there is no way to tell I would say 50/50.
Probably around a one in infinte probability 
very good.. the best in fact..   edit: ouch! I guess flip replies are not appreciated here.. still my comment stands. It is very likely the universe is infinite. It fits in better with our theories and measurements.
Crap article which merely name drops and raises more questions.
In these experiments, are they talking about right chiral neutrinos or an entirely different 0 charge lepton beyond the SM?
I know every uni is different, but I can tell you about the one I'm at.

They offer four degree titles - Physics, astrophysics, physics with astrophysics, and theoretical physics - all either BSc or MPhys degrees. For the first two years, they are very very similar - the only differences being the theoretical students take analysis classes instead of doing labs, and when physics students get optional modules, the theoretical and astro students have already had their modules chosen. This makes it very easy to change between courses up until the end of the second year - I'm currently on for a BSc in Physics, but I want to change to the MPhys and that should be very easy to do.

What I'm trying to say is, don't panic too much. The courses are going to be very similar for at least the first year if not the first two years, and most universities shouldn't have a problem with you changing courses.

Be sure to go and visit the departments that you're applying to if possible and ask them any questions you have. If that's too difficult (distance or travel costs) then email the department and they will be more than happy to answer any questions you have. 

Best of luck in your search!
Take a look at the specific requirements for each degree scheme and then pick the most flexible. For my undergrad, there was physics, astrophysics, theoretical and computational physics, medical physics and physics with astronomy. Physics with astronomy allowed you to take any combination of modules, including those under all the other degree schemes, so in a sense all other degrees were a subset of the choices available to the physics with astronomy scheme, and therefore it made no sense to pick anything else. Then with regard to module choices, look at the syllabus, learning outcomes and past papers for each module and just do what you find interesting. You can switch between a 3 and 4 year degree right up until the end of your 3rd year as long as your grades are good, so you don't have to worry about that until further down the line. 
Theoretical and astrophysics are going to be largely the same track until your later year. As with a bachelor's vs undergrad masters track. In other words, you don't really have to decide right away. Probably can still move things around even in Junior year. 

Also, what exactly do you mean by "theoretical physics"
If you want to do theoretical physics you should choose that right from the start. It may be different at other unis, but I go to a uni in the UK and here the theory students get pretty much independent mentoring because the mathematics content is so much tougher for them. It's practically a different course from straight physics. You can switch to Theoretical Physics later though (probably end of 2nd year latest), but it is isn't easy.

As for others, they will differ early on a lot in what labs they do, but the lectures won't be too different until at least the 2nd year.

Theoretical and astro are completely different, and most theoretical won't cover any astro modules, and vice versa (unless they choose to).

Defo do the undergrad masters if you have *any* desire to continue with physics after your undergraduate. It's not a bad idea anyway, all the best modules are in the fourth year! And you get to do a big research project which could land you nicely in a PhD position.

EDIT: I do straight physics but I pick all the theory modules because I find them the most interesting
Studying famous people is prone to [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) and it is likely to lead you to false conclusions.
Feynman loved having sex and playing the bongos.

Newton lived celibate.

Einstein was a social butterfly and never stopped working.

Dirac hardly ever spoke and was extremely afraid of social situations.

There's not much of a trend.
In his book *Letters on England*, the French philosopher Voltaire writes of Isaac Newton:

>Sir Issac, during the long course of years he enjoyed, was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.

Shortly thereafter, the English mathematician Charles Hutton writes in the chapter *Memoirs of the Lives and Writings of the Most Eminent Authors*, commenting further on Newton's abstinence:

>Newton never married; and it has been said, that "perhaps he never had leisure to think of it; that, being immersed in profound studies during the prime of his age, and afterwards engaged in an employment of great importance, and even quite taken up with the company which his merit drew to him, he was not sensible of any vacancy in life, nor of the want of a companion at home." These however do not appear to be any sufficient reasons for his never marrying, if he had had an inclination so to do. It is much more likely that he had a constitutional indifference to the state, and even to the sex in general; and it has even been said of him, that he never once knew woman.

Apparently the political philosopher John Locke once tried to set up Newton with some girls, but Newton was not impressed, and later wrote a letter to Locke that began:

>Sir:  
>Being of opinion that you endeavoured to embroil me with woemen & by other means I was so much affected with it as that when one told me you were sickly & would not live I answered twere better if you were dead.

TL;DR: According to primary sources, Newton was seriously committed to celibacy and devoted his life to matters beyond the carnal.
i think they use pencils or pens and paper a lot. also they tend to use computers and sit at tables. i think reading textbooks is pretty common habit.
In a lot of pop-sci QM books you'll find more or less interesting
stories about Schrödingers (many) relationships to women.  At some point
he and his wife lived together with Mr and Mrs Weyl.  The legend tells
the four had a lot of fun in bed.

They tend to die. Or are in the process of dying.

Fundamentally, what does the principle quantum number, n, count? I think answering that question will answer your question.
Take a look at the black rings in the 2s and 3s orbitals. This implies the density is 0 in those rings. 1s doesn't have these and has density>0 where these are in the other two. If the plots were additive or showing them together, there wouldn't be any black rings. 
It's a slice through the 2s orbital. The 1s is not shown. Remember that the ns orbitals have n-1 radial nodes, so they will flip sign n-1 times, which is probably what leads you to see the illusion of a 1s orbital in the 2s image.
In your source and include directories, you probably have some files called "PhysicsList.cc" and "PhysicsList.hh", or something like that. These should contain your physical processes.

If you don't have those, just run a "grep" for "decay" and see if you can find where muon decay is handled in the code.
I'm hoping to see some discussion on this topic, inspired by [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/567a39/smallest_transistor_ever/).

How do you interpret Moore's law? What kind of trends do you expect over the next few years? Why?
All "Moores's law", or 'Moore's observation' says is that 'the number of transistors per unit area on a substrate will double per unit time.

So the only advancement is miniaturisation, not performance, not switching times, not 'technology', not doing anything necessarily better, just doing the same thing in a smaller space. Sure some secondary improvements in lower transistor switching power consumption, (from lower inductance and capacitance, and shorter path lengths. But half the size does not mean twice the performance. 
I personally find this very exciting. Reducing die sizes has always been the method used to meet the consumer demand to increase performance. Now economically and technologically this looks to be out of the question, but it does not mean that performance will not increase. Instead, it means that tech companies can finally look towards new ways to increase performance. It means, I think, a higher emphasis on optimizing the structure of the chips and the underlying ideas on how to achieve efficient calculation.
Moore's law is halving the size of transistors every 2 years, but there are still plenty of innovations going on that could well more than double the speed of the chips so moore's law has become irrelevant.

Again? 
Things like memristors and 3d stacked circuits should allow the growth curve to continue for a few years. Especially in neural-network applications. (In terms of performance per watt anyways). Maybe even longer if quantum computing is made mass-producable, hinging on room-temp super conductors
I have heard that Carbon Nanotubes could potentially take over. 
I am extremely heartened by the recent confirmation of topological states of matter, and I hope topological insulators will crush Moore's Law as soon as we're able to control them. 

Spintronics must also emerge at some point as the go-to technology which will make current transistors seem like vacuum tubes in our minds.
~~First, if Moore's law is not true, then stop calling it a law. Call it Moore's prediction. ~~

~~Second,~~

~~>Everyone agrees that the twilight of Moore's law will not mean the end of progress. “Think about what happened to airplanes"~~

~~Yes think of how air travel used to have songs written about how modern and exciting it is to have the freedom to travel around the globe in style. It has since become a nickel-and-dime operation that treats people like sardines (who apparently have to pay for water and bathroom use and luggage fees, etc). I would hope computing doesn't go this route. ~~

It would seem computer scientists have a major problem on their hands. In the days when Moor's prediction was correct, hardware and software alike benefitted from a predictable architecture on predictably faster cpus. Now that the hardware may be changing there seems to be an urgent need to have an agnostic language (or language base) that can handle multi-threaded and multi-processing (CPU and GPU) instructions without having to require rewrites of software every time hardware is upgraded. This is especially important in scientific fields where codes take decades to develop. 

Please keep working hard computer scientists! I really want to see some common thread (no pun intended) in language support as systems become more heterogeneous. 

Edit: removed irrelevant comments. 
Quantum computing will catch up, and surpass, in less time than you may think
>I understand that resistance could potentially be the balancing force.

Yes, there is a drag force acting on the electrons. It works out that **on average**, the electrons move along with some constant velocity. 

See the [Drude model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_model).
Apart from the resistive mechanism that keeps things linear, I think you might have other problems with your analysis.

Current is a flux of charge through a surface in unit time. Its value does not depend on whether the charge is accelerating as it goes through the surface or not.

On the other hand, if an even distribution of charge is moving at a velocity through the surface, the velocity determines how much of the distribution passes through the surface.

Does that distinction make sense?
Thanks all! I remember learning this a long time ago now.
Can you explain in more detail what we're looking at?
The music...oh god the music...
This is actually something I have pondered upon for a good while now. I know magnetic sensors use it for position sensing using this concept. I am rather interested in hearing people's thoughts about this. 
This is amazing. I want to learn more about how this was produced. 
The more I learn about these forces, the more I'm interested!

Can we discuss the practical applications of this?
You're greatly misunderstanding what an observation in the sense of wave function collapse is.

First, there are no n-dimensional beings. There is not even the concept of a being in string theory. If we take would assume n+1=11 dimensions, then everything is "living" in ten dimensions because the particles we are made of "live" there. 

Secondly, not perceiving the extra dimensions is not the same as not observing them. The particles we are made of interact with the extra dimensions, hence, we observe them. However, we do not perceive the extra dimensions as the effects are too tiny to be noticed with our senses.

Think of Schrödinger's Cat. Just because you've gone asleep doesn't mean the wave function for the rest of the world is suddenly unobserved.

Tl;dr: Not seeing the extra dimensions is not the same as not observing them, us humans would still observe what happens there.

That collapse "negatively affects the extra-dimensional beings which can hold all the different probabilities but are upset to have their reality reduced" is the story in Quarantine by Greg Egan.
not really a string theorist, but I have read a lot on wave function collapse.


It's not really well understood how wave function collapse works, so you're pretty free to have beings cause wave function collapse by an act of observation. That's a pretty safe leap for a fictional story, although some experts would disagree with it.


However, it looks like you don't understand wave function collapse when you say that 3-dimensional beings can cause collapse while others are beyond it. What makes 3-dimensional beings different from extra-dimensional beings? 


Additionally, wave function collapse is not just a collapse in position space, it can also be a collapse in momentum space. The wave function can describe a system's position(s) and its momentum(s) (and energy(ies)). When it 'collapses' in one space, i.e. it gives one value for position or momentum states, it 'expands' in another space, gives multiple values for position/momentum states. Let's say our wave function tells us the system is at location 3 in the x direction, then it might tell us the momentum in the x direction is a bunch of different values. I should say that position and momentum space are just words that mean the whole set of position and momentum states any system could have.


This is usually true for both the momentum and position of a particular coordinate direction. If the wave function collapses in x position, it expands in x momentum. If it collapses in y momentum, it expands in y position. I haven't studied string theory, but I assume this pattern is true for spaces with higher dimensions too.


What this means is how many dimensions you have in your space has no bearing on wave function collapse, and if it does, I fail to understand how, sorry. Even further, if we assume that the act of observation causes wave function collapse, it would appear that 3 dimensional beings cannot cause wave function collapse in the other dimensions because they cannot observe them (unless they do some nifty probing). In other words, 3 dimensional beings would have a difficult time collapsing wave functions in the extra-dimensions.


Personally, I agree with the decoherence viewpoint, which suggests that exact or close decoherence is equivalent with collapse. The general rule of thumb for determining this decoherence is by judging the conservations of the system. If the system conserves energy/momentum, then the position states of the system are expanded. If it is probed heavily with high energy particles, i.e. it quickly changes in energy/momentum, then the system has very collapsed position states. Applying this to the premise of your book, it seems like wave function collapse has little dependence on whether you're a 3-dimensional being or an extra-dimensional being. As long as you can change a system's energy/momentum quickly, you can collapse its position states.
This article is pretty poorly named.  They mainly just argue that topological materials may be used to make a general quantum computer one day.  Also it has this gem of a sentence:

> [...] one big obstacle is that these computers are very fragile with respect to surrounding “noise.”

>[...] This is the main reason why we don’t yet use quantum computers in our everyday lives. 




but are they really though?
*Here is the text of the article for those who don't want to disable ABP*




<p>
  British scientists David Thouless, Duncan Haldane and Michael
  Kosterlitz <a href="https://theconversation.com/odd-states-of-matter-how-three-british-theorists-scooped-the-2016-nobel-prize-for-physics-66517" rel="nofollow">won this year’s</a> Nobel Prize in Physics
  “for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and
  topological phases of matter.”
</p>
  <p>
  The reference to “theoretical discoveries” makes it tempting to
  think their work will not have practical applications or affect
  our lives some day. The opposite may well be true. 
</p>
  <p>
  To understand the potential, it helps to understand the theory.
  Most people know that an atom has a nucleus in the middle and
  electrons orbiting around it.
</p>
  <p>
  These correspond to different energy levels. When atoms group
  into substances, all the energy levels of each atom combine
  into <a href="https://www.halbleiter.org/en/fundamentals/conductors-insulators-semiconductors/" rel="nofollow">bands of electrons</a>. Each of these so-called
  energy bands has space for a certain number of electrons. And
  between each band are gaps in which electrons can’t flow. 
</p>
  <p>
  If you apply an electrical charge (a flow of extra electrons) to
  a material, its conductivity is determined by whether the highest
  energy band has room for more electrons. If it does have room,
  the material will behave as a conductor.
</p>
  <p>
  If not, you need extra energy to push the current of electrons
  into a new empty band and as a result the material behaves as an
  insulator. Understanding conductivity is vital to electronics,
  since electronic products ultimately rely on components that are
  electric conductors, semiconductors and insulators. 
</p>
  <p>
  What Thouless, Haldane and Kosterlitz began to predict in the
  1970s and 1980s and <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.226801" rel="nofollow">other</a> theorists have <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.146802" rel="nofollow">since</a> taken <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/314/5806/1757" rel="nofollow">forward</a> is that certain materials break this
  rule. Instead of having a gap between bands in which electrons
  can’t flow, they have a special energy level between their bands
  where certain unexpected things are possible. 
</p>
  <p><a href="https://theconversation.com/odd-states-of-matter-how-three-british-theorists-scooped-the-2016-nobel-prize-for-physics-66517" rel="nofollow">This quality</a> only exists on the surface
  or edge of these materials, and is very robust. It also depends
  to some extent on the shape of the material – the topology, as we
  say in physics.
</p>
  <p>
  It behaves identically for a sphere and an egg, for example, but
  would be different for something shaped like a doughnut because
  of the hole in the middle. The first measurements of this kind of
  behaviour have been taken for a current along <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/314/5806/1757" rel="nofollow">the boundary of a flat sheet</a>.
</p>
  <h2>
  Computer power
</h2>
  <p>
  The properties of these so-called topological materials could
  potentially be extremely useful. Electrical currents can move
  without resistance across their surface, for example, even where
  a device is moderately damaged. 
</p>
  <p><a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-a-superconductor-38122" rel="nofollow">Superconductors</a> can already do this
  without having topological properties, but they only work at very
  low temperatures – meaning you use a lot of energy keeping them
  cool. Topological materials have the potential to do the same job
  at higher temperatures. 
</p>
  <p>
  This has important implications for computing: most of the energy
  computers currently use is to run ventilators to cool down the
  heat produced by electrical resistance in the circuits. Remove
  this heat problem and you potentially make them many times more
  energy efficient.
</p>
  <p>
  This could massively reduce their carbon emissions, for instance.
  It could also lead to batteries with far longer life spans.
  Researchers are already experimenting with topological materials
  like cadmium telluride and mercury telluride to
  bring <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/314/5806/1757" rel="nofollow">this vision to life</a>.
</p>
  <p>
  There is also the potential for a major breakthrough in quantum
  computing. Classical computers encode information by either
  applying voltage or not applying voltage to a chip. The computer
  reads this as a 0 or 1 respectively for each “bit” of
  information. You put these bits together to build up more complex
  information. This is how the binary system works. 
</p>
  <p>
  With quantum computing, you deliver information to electrons
  instead of microchips. The energy levels of these electrons then
  correspond to zeros and ones just like in classical computers,
  but in quantum mechanics both can be true at the same time.
</p>
  <p>
  Without getting into too much theory, this raises the possibility
  of computers that can process exceedingly large amounts of data
  in parallel and are therefore much faster.

  While the likes of <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130894-000-revealed-googles-plan-for-quantum-computer-supremacy/" rel="nofollow">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/quantum/" rel="nofollow">IBM</a> are researching how to manipulate enough
  electrons to create quantum computers that are more powerful than
  classical computers, one big obstacle is that these computers are
  very fragile with respect to surrounding “noise.”
</p>
  <p>
  Whereas classical computers can cope with interference, quantum
  computers end up producing intolerable numbers of errors because
  of shaky support frames, stray electrical fields or air molecules
  hitting the processor even if you hold it in a high vacuum. This
  is the main reason why we don’t yet use quantum computers in our
  everyday lives. 
</p>
  <p>
  One potential solution is to store information in more than one
  electron, since noise typically affects quantum processors at the
  level of single particles. Supposing you have five electrons all
  jointly storing the same bit of information, so long as the
  majority store it correctly, a disturbance to a single electron
  won’t undermine the system. 
</p>
  <p>
  Researchers have been experimenting with this so-called majority
  voting, but topological engineering potentially offers an easier
  fix.
</p>
  <p>
  In the same way as topological superconductors can carry a flow
  of electricity well enough that it doesn’t get hampered by
  resistance, topological quantum processors could be robust enough
  to be insensitive to noise problems. They could yet offer a major
  contribution to making quantum computing a reality. Researchers
  in the US <a href="http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n1/abs/nphys1151.html" rel="nofollow">are working</a> on it.
</p>
  <h2>
  The future
</h2>
  <p>
  It might take between ten and 30 years before scientists become
  sufficiently good at manipulating electrons to make quantum
  computing possible, but they open up exciting possibilities. They
  could simulate the formation of molecules, for example, which is
  numerically too complicated for today’s computers.
</p>
  <p>
  This could revolutionise drug research by enabling us to predict
  what will happen during chemical processes in the body.
</p>
  <p>
  To give just one other example, quantum computing has the
  potential to make artificial intelligence a reality. Quantum
  machines may be better at learning than classical computers,
  partly because they might be underpinned by much cleverer
  algorithms. Cracking AI could be a step change in human existence
  – for better or worse. 
</p>
  <p>
  In short, the predictions of Thouless, Haldane and Kosterlitz
  have the potential to help revolutionise 21st-century computer
  technology. Where the Nobel committee has recognised the
  importance of their work in 2016, we are likely to be thanking
  them many decades into the future.

Does anyone have any idea on books that cover cavity-QED in a somewhat deeper way than the usual ''outlook on potential application or experiment'' that appears in some more general books?

I'm a physics student in my last year of undergrad who's looking to do graduate studies in that subject, so i'm looking towards some field book that covers the subject in depth, if there's any.
Recommendations on a good solid intro to Hydrodynamics for a self-learner?
QFT intro texts? I've already asked this question once in askphysics, but had no time to really start then. I guess more options can never hurt.
I'm new to Engineering, currently studying Telecommunications Engineering, and I want to buy a good physics book to use during my whole degree.
I've found a book from which my teachers drag most of the exercises, the [``Physics for scientifics and engineers´´ by Serway](https://www.amazon.es/Physics-Scientists-Engineers-Raymond-Serway/dp/1133947271/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr= ).
The question is that I want to buy it, but the hardcover version is quite too expensive, so I've found a light version, this version says [International Edition](https://goo.gl/PgRuWJ) , so I'm not sure what are the differences between the hardcover edition and the International one.

Sorry for my bad grammar but my main language is spanish.
Any suggestions for a good electronics textbook? My professor recommends Horowitz & Hill but I find it a bit confusing and I've read it's not good as an introductory text anyway. 
I just started my undergrad and I have a question about textbooks in general. Do you ever go back and use your undergrad textbooks? In other words, are there any worth buying? Or should I continue renting? Right now I'm in Classical Mechanics using Taylor, and I just rented the book for the semester.
I think the theoretical minimum (http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses) provides some really great video lectures. But i have a hard time figuring out which books i should read alongside the lectures and courses. Anyone who could recommend some books?

It should be books that gives a deep understanding of physics, like books you would read when taking a course at college.
I have what may be a somewhat irregular request: I'm interested in course webpages/syllabi. Specifically ones for courses which follow one textbook rather closely and hopefully post which textbook sections to read and homework problems (solutions optional). I'm doing the string theory for undergrads course on MIT OCW right now, and I think it's great. When I'm done, I'd like to move on to:

QFT I/II

String Theory I/II

Ideally I'd like to follow Peskin and Schroeder or maybe Schwartz for QFT, and Polchinski for the string theory. Unfortunately, the MIT OCW courses for these don't follow one text so closely, or don't have readings listed at all, so they make for more difficult self-study. I enjoy self-studying from textbook, but I like to have a schedule from a course to tell me how much is a nice bite-size piece per session, and when is a good time to sit down and work on problems. I've googled and found a couple that seem alright in a pinch, but I'm wondering if anyone knows any that match what I'm looking for more closely. Finally, bonus points for:

Advanced QFT (standard model phenomenology, usually)

String theory topics courses

Thanks to anyone who can help!

Certainly not the smallest. [Single-atom transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-atom_transistor) have been demonstrated in 2004, they are just not practical at the moment. And of course the connections to the transistors need many atoms more.
Am I the only one who read this in Comic Book Guy's (of The Simpsons) voice?
Moore's law keeps getting pushed out due to human creativity...
Please, .gov site. Don't say, "[blank]est. [blank]. Ever." You're a government site, ffs; not a 13-year old.
Not the smallest transistor ever, and frankly not the lowest power transistor you could even make using TMDs, so overall I don't even know how this got fucking published in science. Honestly, there's nothing actually new learned from this experiment and nothing compelling enough to repeat it. The cross-sectional TEM image looks cool, but that's the extent of the paper, "we put a swcnt below some really doped Mos2." You can create better ss's by putting these TMDs semiconducting materials in a tunnel fet configuration with lower voltage requirements. I've literally seen much better performance off standard Bn-Gr-MoS2-Gr-Bn stacks. 
The first transistors were as big as cars, now they're as small as tomatoes. - KenM (paraphrased) 
get outta town!
Anyone make an educated guess as to what kind of thermal temps 1nm transistors might make? Assuming we're talking Molybdenum disulfide which they're using.
Awesome news ! lets now wait for 10 years to see whether it is possible to have them mass produced or not.

P.S. also lets not forget about spintronics and their transistors
I thought dark matter wouldnt interact with the electromagnetic force? Why would they try to detect it with a strong magnetic field?
If they detect axions in the experiment, I really hope someone shouts "hey presto!"
why we keep sticking particles into our conceptual holes? particles in this sense are simply the facilitation of a necessary effect, necessary that is to retain the current model.

I hope this is useful.
Sounds like a great way to learn a lot about statics and spreadsheets! Nice that you can post here and get support from us other weirdos who think this sort of thing is a blast.
Spreadsheets are awesome. Next step: programming. Do you know any programming languages? If not, I recommend learning Python. You can do some awesome physics stuff in Python even as a beginner.
Artificial gravity is rather important and should definitely be considered for any extended stay in space. 
when it comes to artificial gravity focus is usually placed on utilizing centrifugal force, but I don't think it's the most efficient method when we are considering space travel. 
consider re-entry into an atmosphere, any spinning module is going to encounter HUGE stress. 
a different method of generating artificial gravity could be done by using magnetically polarized plates and suits, practically anything which can push the human body down could be used as a gravity replacement. 

for anyone concerned about the 40 minute time length tag, the summary lasts 7m43s from 5:02-13:45.
What's the analogy of the bagel holes for the solid state system?
I took a class in topology once.  There were no bagels whatsoever.  I feel cheated.
At 6:45 old mate is staring at that bagel thinking, don't break it! I'll eat that!
I wish YouTube had some sort of automatic de-interlace processing. Thanks for the upload!
Anything like this for the Nobel Prize in medicine?
> "Topology is a field of mathematics that describes properties that are stable and only change in integer steps"

Wow that's a pretty poor characterization of what topology is about. That's like saying that "quantum mechanics is a field of physics that describes properties of cats."

Isn't that kinda a step function?
I was hoping for *some* discussion already. Anyway...

At about 20 seconds in, a number of equations are written. From what I understand, these apply only to isolated objects and processes within spacetime. (Nonetheless, I am aware that the QM one may be able to describe the whole of spacetime. How *exactly* I do not know. Someone kindly explain.) In other words, I can indeed describe a ball's motion with F=ma without referring to cause and effect, but this is the case because I've deliberately isolated that object and that process from the rest of reality. However, in the event that multiple objects or processes interact, cause and effect enters into our explanatory picture once more. A ball's change in motion can be said to be the effect of another ball bumping into it. If, following our best Physics, it is only this act of selective isolation (rather than anything else) that makes cause and effect unreal *even for elementary objects and processes*, then would this not also imply that the way we understand interactions and systems through Physics will always be ~~incomplete~~ limited in just the sense described?

Could someone critique me here. Any clarifications would be welcome.

*edits for clarification. I was simply writing my stream of thought the first time.
Yes. And that is why FTL in any form is impossible.
If you're solving the Poisson equation, are you only interested in statics? In that case, look into the method of relaxation.
This paper paper is very nice in explaining the inner workings of the Faraday cage and also has code for solving the problem in 2D: http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/chapman_hewett_trefethen.pdf
About me: Undergraduate physics major with astronomy concentration and math minor. I work part time doing tutoring and grading for k-12 students outside of school. 

I want to go into teaching. High school or community college (I only left out university because I don't think I want to get a PhD, and I am under the impression that teaching at university requires a PhD. Please correct me if I'm mistaken). Just have some questions. 

1) Could I find work doing what I've stated I want to do with only a BS, and not an MS? Not opposed to pursuing a masters, just curious. 

2) Should I expect to struggle financially if I choose to pursue a teaching career? I told my mom that I have an interest in teaching, and she told me that I would end up poor. 

Teaching seems like a great career for me. I love physics and math. I like helping others understand concepts. And I want a career with a fair work/life balance so that I can have time to devote to other things that are important such as playing in bands and being with my family. I'm aware that I won't ever be making $200k a year like my parents, but I also don't want to end up poor and hungry. I could use some guidance. 
You think its possible to work on theoretical physics on the side? I dont know what aspect of physics i would like to do but i enjoy working with equations. Just got really into physics recently.
I'm thinking about majoring in either Physics or Math next year in University (HS senior now). I'm applying to several schools such as Tufts, UMass, and Bowdoin, and they aren't as highly rated in these fields as some of the other schools I am applying to. Do these rankings or prestige of the school really matter at undergrad? Or is it more of what grades I get/research done in undergrad that will have more of an impact on a career in STEM whether it be research or with a private employer?
What are the best kinds of jobs to go for with a new physics degree? I'm only a sophomore so I haven't focused in any one area yet. 
Has anyone switched into materials science PHD programs from bachelor's in physics? I'm too interested in energy-related innovation to keep going in pure physics. Any tips or ways to make your application stand out against engineers?
I'm probably going to major in Physics next year at a university. My 'ultimate goal' is to move to the states and start a career as a rocket scientist. I know that majoring in Physics is definitely not the most optimal degree for this particular career path. The thing is, I am very passionate about Physics and I want to understand how the universe works, along with the art behind solving problems. I am planning on doing my bachelor in Physics in Belgium and afterwards doing something like aeronautical engineering that will prepare me for that 'ultimate goal' in the states. At the moment, I have more experience in engineering since I went to a technical school (it's a long story, I kind of changed my mind when it comes to what I want to do in life). My question is, to what extent will a degree in physics help me as a rocket scientist and what field in physics should I choose? Unfortunately, my future university doesn't offer any minors more closely related to rocket science than physics.
What tips would you offer to an undergraduate student attempting to craft his own research project?
I am a physics major. I'm still a sophomore and I've only seen one chemistry and currently working on anatomy and physiology both with lab work. What fascinates me is spacetime and gravitational studies. I want to start working in a lab but I'm not sure what kind of entry level work I could find with the limited knowledge I have gathered through my year at college that will help me in my goals.  I live in Miami if that is of any help. I will be meeting with the head of the physics department this week to find some help. I know there is no such this as a stupid question but there are stupid moments that I have to muddle through. 

My question is what could I apply to at this time in my career that will help me in the future. I am waiting on a recomendation letter from two professors to be able to apply to an REU for the summer of 2017. 
I am a freshman majoring in Physics, and before you say that I need to make sure that I will like Physics first, let me tell you my thoughts. 

I know that college Physics is quite different than high school Physics. I know that I need to get a good feel for Physics before I decide that I want to go to grad school. 

With that said, my current plans are to go to grad school, finish up with a doctorate, and eventually work my way up to teaching at a university and doing research. 

And if I do go to grad school, I would like to go to a good program, preferably top 10. Here are the top 10 programs:

Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

California Institute of Technology 

Harvard University 

Princeton University 



Stanford University 


University of California—​Berkeley 

Cornell University 

University of Chicago 

University of Illinois—​Urbana-​Champaign 

University of California—​Santa Barbara 




Obviously, these programs are very competitive and the students are selected based on how much they excelled in college and on the GRE. What do the students do that get into these programs? I'll let you know that I am currently going to a school that is ranked 95 in the nation for Physics(the University of Kentucky), not that great, but I plan on working hard enough to get me into a good program. 

What are some things I can be doing now as a freshman up into my sophomore year so I can satisfy myself a spot into one of these schools?

My current plans in college are to gain good bonds with my preferred professors, and to ensure myself a research position with them in my Sophomore, Junior, and Senior year. I also am really interested in educating Physics to masses. There is a professor at my university that is noticed as a spectacular presenter, and works a lot with educating children on basic physics principles. That seems like something that would fit my preference precisely, so I am considering contacting him and seeing if I can work with him on something. 

Also, how do minors affect your chances of getting into a good grad school? I know how different grad school acceptance is to undergrad, so I don't really know much about it. Does minoring in something in something different like Philosophy or Linguistics(both serious minors that I considered. They would both be something I like) set me apart from the crowd in a good way? 

What can I be doing in these next couple years to guarantee me a spot in the top 10s?
Humans are inherently terrible at randomness, so I really don't see the point of this other than as a PR stunt.
This is stupid. Why?

Try the quick bell test...   http://thebigbelltest.org/#/game

consider the entropy of the sting you produced.
It's probably lots and lots of 0101010101... followed by "oh shit i'm just repeating myself" ...000000111111... "oh shit that's not random either" ....0011010... back to ...0101010101. 

people suck at randomness.
Is not their description of observer completely wrong?   I don't think modern quantum physics requires a PERSON to observe events before they're determined.
!RemindMe 54 days
Similarly, I heard about an experiment where the seeds for RNG for each side of the bell test were from cosmic microwave background light from opposite sides of the CMB, so that each photon hadn't had the chance to get to the other detector yet. I thought this was a brilliant way to get the detector orientations to really be independent.
I wonder if there are specific games or tasks that would really get at what humans can be random about. 
This is today! 47/50 random. But I can't beat the Master Level Oracle .... It seems to be guessing my selections about 60% of the time.
On mobile currently but i could PM you a general physics paper I did from first year that should be the right level. I don't want to post it publicly because it will have my school and year on it. None of the questions will be groundbreaking, all will be easily googleable but knowing how and what to search is a skill in itself that first years will need to practice.
This might be a bit tough for first year students, but you asked for challenging so it might be good. You have a bunch of material with constant density and total mass M. What shape should you put this in, so that you maximize the surface gravity of it at a given point? Solving it requires some calculus of variations, which first year students might not have seen, but you should see in your second year or so. 

I don't remember the particulars, but one that took me pretty long was something about proving that ANY kinematic trajectory from the ground that reaches it peak within some half-sphere of radius R, is bounded by some particular function of R and perhaps other parameters like v0. It was only calculus but required some differential manipulation and conceptual tricks.
Try looking here.  You should be able to download the books you find interesting.

I have to be honest I have never seen one, but I wish you luck!
Yes, but I usually just refer to him as 'my cat' !
I was reviewing a paper for a low-impact journal and the paper was using a numerical method to solve an equation I had derived in an earlier paper. I was tempted to ask the authors to officially name the equation after me in the paper...but I didn't.

In other papers I have had people refer to a notation I used, using my name.
My last name is pretty funny sounding to international ears, so I hope not
I don't. But a professor I work does, and he sure as hell uses it. When I have something named after me, I'm going to assume it's important enough that it is named for a reason. And I have no problems with taking that deserved glory.
I reviewed a series of papers last year about a certain topic. One review article I found referred to a mathematical model in a previous paper as the 'CHR' model. Upon further reading I realized he was the 'C' in the CHR and was referencing his own paper for the review. He tried to name his own model!

This came out around 2008. Then a series of small breakthroughs in the field occurred around 2014 (by his own graduate student nonetheless), and she referred to it by a different name. So it appears he tried to name his own model, but the name didn't stick. 
Yes! Physics is a great enabling degree, have a look [here](http://www.physics.org/careers.asp?contentid=381) for some career options with a Physics degree
Sure! I have had numerous jobs after getting my physics degree designing X-ray telescopes, building remote sensing instruments, developing techniques for testing circuit boards, building machine vision systems for manufacturing facilities and I am currently working on a startup company to build and operate a satellite constellation to track hurricanes. My classmates have also worked in a myriad of jobs dealing with engineering defense systems, medical imaging, writing software for a range of consumer and specialty applications and lots of non-science related fields (e.g. fireman, business mangers, etc.). I have found that a physics degree gives one an excellent set of tools for approaching a large range of science, engineering and management professions.
Yes, it can lead you to basically anything ranging from a world leader (Merkel) to a garbage collector (a mate of mine from uni). The world is your proverbial oyster.
I mean there's always engineering and software development.
I've heard of physics graduates going into professional schools such as Law and Medicine, as well as working in risk-assessment for insurance companies. Physics provides such a wonderful skillset for all sorts of jobs.
Yeah, most of the guys who I graduated with who didn't do PhDs are either in high precision engineering or finance. There's lots of wiggle room out there.
I graduated with a degree in Physics and now lead and AI & Robotics department. It's not the degree that makes you, but how you prepare yourself. 
Various careers gone into by people I know from my undergraduate:

* Banker
* Researcher
* School Teacher
* Does something involving atomic weapons
* Works for British version of the NSA
* Designs safety systems for nuclear submarines
* Geophysicist (looks for oil deposits and stuff)
* Architect
* Pilot
* Computer programmer
* Medical Physicist
* Engineer


Laser wakefield postdoc here if there are any questions
*if* this is what you're asking, no, you cannot obtain the centre of mass from the centroid. You need to do the whole calculation of the weighted average of the positions all over again.
How about modifying the program to multiply the location of each atom/amino acid by its molecular mass?
The centroid is the center of mass if all of the elements in the system have the same mass. If they don't have the same mass, you have to use the definition of center of mass to calculate it.
It would be an adjustment to your program. Each "piece" that you used to come up with the centroid would have to be multiplied by its mass. That's all.
May I ask how you're doing it? I'm curious.
The advanced scientific background on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2016 is [here](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2016/advanced-physicsprize2016.pdf) and for the popular science background click [here](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2016/popular-physicsprize2016.pdf)
I admit I was a bit suprised. I thought a LIGO win was sort of a given? 


According to this


https://telescoper.wordpress.com/2016/10/03/the-2016-nobel-prize-for-physics/


They may have made the official detection announcement after the nomination deadline.

Shoucheng Zhang and Charlie Kane are probably feeling pretty disappointed.
ELI5?
By the way, APS has decided to make several key papers related to this Nobel prize free to read. Here are the free papers, and I include a short descriptor of their importance.

[Quantized Hall Conductance in a Two-Dimensional Periodic Potential](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.405?utm_source=APS+Physics+Main+Group&utm_campaign=178f4c807e-2016+Nobel+Prize+Announcement&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_825303224b-178f4c807e-107969385) by Thouless, Kohmoto, Knightingale, den Nijs

This is known as the "TKNN" paper, and it details how to calculate topological invariants associated with bands in band theory. The original application was the integer quantum Hall effect, but it applies to gapped topological/Chern insulators, including the Haldane model below.

[Model for a Quantum Hall Effect without Landau Levels: Condensed-Matter Realization of the "Parity Anomaly"](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.2015?utm_source=APS+Physics+Main+Group&utm_campaign=178f4c807e-2016+Nobel+Prize+Announcement&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_825303224b-178f4c807e-107969385) by Haldane.

This introduced what we now call the "Haldane model," which is basically an early version of a topological insulator. Haldane wrote down this model as a way to achieve a quantized Hall conductivity without an external magnetic field, but unlike the later Kane-Mele model, Haldane's model does break time-reversal symmetry. Recently this model has been realized experimentally.

[Nonlinear Field Theory of Large-Spin Heisenberg Antiferromagnets: Semiclassically Quantized Solitons of the One-Dimensional Easy-Axis Néel State](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.50.1153?utm_source=APS+Physics+Main+Group&utm_campaign=178f4c807e-2016+Nobel+Prize+Announcement&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_825303224b-178f4c807e-107969385) by Haldane

This introduced a quantum field-theoretic description of spin chains (spins in one-dimension interacting via the [Heisenberg model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_model_(quantum\))). The S=1/2 spin chain was known to be gapless since Bethe solved it exactly in the 30s, and it was assumed that this behavior would persist for higher spin (in fact there is a theorem that it's gapless for all half-integer spin). Haldane found that the field theory corresponding to integer spin was a field theory known to be gapped (due to the work of Polyakov), while half-integer spin chains contain an extra topological term which makes them gapless. This difference between integer and half-integer spin chains became known as "Haldane's conjecture," but it's universally accepted now.

[Universal Jump in the Superfluid Density of Two-Dimensional Superfluids](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.1201?utm_source=APS+Physics+Main+Group&utm_campaign=178f4c807e-2016+Nobel+Prize+Announcement&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_825303224b-178f4c807e-107969385) by Nelson and Kosterlitz

It seems that none of the original papers/reviews on the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition are in APS journals, but this was an important paper because it showed that a superfluid transition in 2D (which is a KT transition) acquires a universal jump in superfluid density at the transition point. This jump was very quickly found in experiments.

[Quantized Hall conductance as a topological invariant](http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.31.3372?utm_source=APS+Physics+Main+Group&utm_campaign=178f4c807e-2016+Nobel+Prize+Announcement&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_825303224b-178f4c807e-107969385) by Niu, Thouless, and Wu

This is a generalization of the TKNN result to systems which have disorder and/or interactions, and therefore don't have a band theory description. This justifies the precise quantization of conductivity in real systems.
Am I the only one who thinks it's sort of awkward to lump BKT transitions and band topological insulators (EDIT: I guess more generally symmetry protected topological order) into the same Nobel prize just because both phenomena involve the word "topology"?
How big was the role the winners played in developing topological insulators?
And the greatest article title goes to: [British Scientists win Nobel Prize in physics for work so baffling it has to be described using bagels](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/10/04/british-scientists-win-nobel-prize-in-physics-for-work-so-baffli/).
Could explain what this is exactly?
Correct me if I am wrong. Using topological features such as invariance, the behavior of conductivity of a thin sheet was discovered, and subsequently in a chain of magnets in some materials. Next, by the use of topological invariance and quantum vortices in a lattice, it was discovered that exotic phase transitions were a possibility. Now, we are trying to find them in 2, or 3 dimensions. 
I had Thouless for an undergrad class many years ago!
You'll all be sorry when my doomsday engine breaks time! Or you'll never be! Ehh I'll get back to you on that...
Apparently Dr. Thouless suffers from dementia, and may not even remember his work. Very sad.
I predicted this for last year!
Kosterlitz went to my school!
The Nobel Prize in Physics 2016 was divided, one half awarded to David J. Thouless, the other half jointly to F. Duncan M. Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz "for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter".

https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2016/
The winner was a professor of one my current professors. 
What do you think is more significant this research or the fact that neutrinos have mass?( the 2015 nobel prize awarded for this). I think any theoretical work that has potential applications is the most exciting.
that fucking cameraman
When I first learnt about topological Insulator, I apparently asked how come this thing has not gotten Nobel yet? Sounds like I could tell the future. 
I'm not sure I understand your question?... The thing you're doing for EE? Do it for physics.

As an aside, I'm not sure how much research experience you have under your belt (if you did any internships in labs, etc) but try and get a bit of that in your own field first. The world of research and the world of physics-as-formalism (taught in books) is often... universes apart. The transition can be pretty tough and I've had a lot of friends realize they preferred physics as a hobby than a job. .. the hard way.
With your remaining time in university, see if you can take a class in quantum mechanics and one in advanced classical mechanics, as electives.

Then, apply to graduate programs in physics. Your EE background should cover a lot of ground.
If you're interested in studying quantum mechanics independently, I cannot recommend [Dr Beck's book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Mechanics-Experiment-Mark-Beck/dp/0199798125) highly enough. You can probably find it in your university library. It helps to have a solid understanding of linear algebra and diff'eq, but his approach to QM using photon polarization rather than just throwing Schrodinger at you is pretty novel and I think makes learning the terminology so much easier.
There's this nifty site by the 1999 Nobel prize winner Gerard 't Hooft on this very subject:

 [How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html)

I cannot vouch for its quality as I haven't followed it myself, but it lists subjects that (he thinks that) you should know and has some links to documents you can use to study them.
As an electrical engineer, you have skills that are invaluable for designing and constructing research projects. I would suggest leveraging that -- if you can work on physics research projects in an engineering capacity, you'd be rubbing shoulders with professional physicists and you'd be immersed in it all the time.

EDIT: in response to the THEORETICAL physicist part -- hmmmm that's a tricky one... read the fuck out of books, and get really good at mathematics? 
Here's a Link to the [American Physical Society (APS)](http://www.aps.org/careers/physicists/index.cfm) with more guidance. 

If you would like to be a research physicist, you should consider receiving an advanced degree in physics. Start looking at to graduate programs in physics, a good place to start is [gradSchoolShopper](https://www.gradschoolshopper.com/gradschool/) and see if they have research you are interested in. If you in your final year of your earning your BA, you need to start applying NOW, some applications are already due! You'll need to take the physics GRE (which you usually should study for) and the standard GRE for most institutions. Admissions to these programs are usual based on your undergraduate record, your research experience and any publications, and then your Physics GRE score. Ofcourse some institutions are more competitive than others. The typical suggestion is a least apply 6 schools. 2 "Reach" Schools were you would love to go but will probably be lucky to get in, 2 Schools you feel like you would have fair chance at acceptance, and then 2 "Fallback Schools" that you are certain would you could easily get into without any problem and would be okay with going to. And then apply to some more.
 
A warning with theoretical physics research, you will need a strong mathematical background, and you should be prepared to find funding tighter than the experimental side.

Most jobs in pure research with either be in Academia or National Labs, and fewer in Industry.
I despise these titles: "Strange Matter"? "Exotic Matter"?  Here's what a spin liquid material looks like:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbertsmithite#/media/File:Herbertsmithite-163165.jpg

These titles make it sound like it's a quark-gluon soup or something.  Could science journalist put at least the tiniest bit of effort?  How about at least "Exotic Magnetic Properties" or "Strange Magnetism" or something?

I think your question is why current is used as the base unit instead of charge, which /u/pyummel doesn't answer. Although he is right that one can be defined in terms of the other, you would still expect that charge would be more the fundamental choice that we would prefer for the base unit.

The reason why current was chosen is operational. Current is measured with an ammeter: a very simple and accurate device, which was already widely available in the late 1800s when the SI units were being finalized. Even basic laboratories were equipped with accurate ammeters.

But measuring static electricity/charge itself is a far more complicated task. There was no simple "charge-meter" device that could tell you how many Coulombs you had; charge was usually measured indirectly, with a more complicated and inaccurate apparatus.

With this in mind, SI's choice to make the Ampere a base unit and the Coulomb a derived unit is perfectly sensible.
Please use google and Please go to #askphysics
The aim of the SI base unit is to be able to express the unit of any physical quantity with as less different units as possible. The unit of the charge can be expressed from the unit of the current and the unit of time : C=A*s. Therefore, adding the Coulomb in the SI base unit would be redundunt. However, we could imagine another system of units that would replace the ampere by the coulomb as a basic unit, it's an arbitrary choice.

Why not both? Both go **very** well together. Isn't double majoring allowed in Sweden?

Also, and this may be slightly disappointing but uh... physics in pop culture is pretty much all fluff. The math IMO is the best part for me. It is SUCH a good feeling when you learn how certain things connect, but that takes effort. Prepare for said effort.


Your odds of getting a job in Physics, depends heavily on what field you're interested in and that's something you won't figure out right away.  If you're only interested in working at the highest levels of research, your odds aren't great.  There's only one Einstein or Feynman, but that doesn't mean you should give up!  There's tons of opportunities that are exciting at all levels.

I'm one of the rare unicorns that got a job as a physicist in industry with only a BS, though I'm now working on my MS part time.  About 1/3rd of the time, I work just like an engineer writing code or whatever needs to be done.  I doubt there are many physics jobs at all today that don't frequently intersect with computer science!  There's tons of work for solving complex equations or modeling physical interactions that require a strong background in both fields.

My advice is to try some of both!  I personally enjoy computer science, but only when it has a physical connection.  Sign me up to simulate a radiation detector or analyze data, but don't ever expect me to design a website or write a communication protocol.  It's all personal preference.  It's also definitely possible to get a job as an engineer with a physics degree as long as you have the skills they're looking for.  I've worked with several people that did this including an old boss.
I would say switch to CompSci. There's not much point in Physics if you don't enjoy solving problems and doing experiments. 
someone with a CS degree with a good grounding in math and physics is highly desired and you'll be in a great position to pick and choose the jobs and work you do, also the types of problems you will get to solve are far more interesting and rewarding.

Qualified physicist with computer knowledge are think on the ground, the chances of having offers for work and the opportunity to turn down ones that don't interest you will be far less if any.
I talked to a professor recently though after he gave a seminar, he started out in engineering and ended up doing computer modelling in fluid mechanics as part of the mathematics department. I asked how he can just swap, he replied that all of the disciplines are interconnected, if you have a problem in some other discipline that you want to tackle, you just do it. If you can learn physics, you can learn other things too. Even Elon Musk started with a physics degree, but he is technically an Engineer, and he clearly spent some time learning business and coding. It is very common from what I can tell.

One of the ways I see it lately, is that when you have an endgoal, there is a wide set of disciplines that will fit into it. For example, if you want to be an astronaut, there is a broad and fairly well defined set of skills that you start to work towards: Russian Language, Medicine, Biomed, Spelunkering, Diving, Robotics and Engineering, Electronics, Science (any field, some of them are required to perform experiments in microgravity and such), and Aviation. 

**tldr:**

As with many things in life, it really depends on what you want to do with all of it.
Also, you should broaden your horizons. There is lots of interesting physics research besides particle / high energy physics (like what is going on at LHC, and mostly on blackboards / computer screens far away from LHC itself). Of course you could say the very frontier of understanding the world around us is in that field of physics, but it does not mean there is nothing going on in the rest of physics.

It is not my impression that you have to be extremely "intelligent" to pursue a career in physics. Hard work works as well. Also being flexible is very important. You could do your bacherlor, master and phd in the same place (say near your home town), but then most certainly you need to move to a few different places to get postdoc positions, preferably abroad. So make sure to get a flexible girlfriend/boyfriend :P Quite a few people quit academia after their phd becuase they don't want to move abroad or away to get postdoc positions. Maybe they have a partner with a job where they currently are, or they've bought a house, etc.
Does anyone know where or how I can access Faraday's work on Faraday rotation? I'm having a lot of trouble finding his publications on the phenomenon.
I'm reading Dirac's book on QM and there the commutation relation f classical poisson brackets is used to set the momentum position operators relation in QM. This seems like a huge leap to me. The argument that the behavior should give the classical limit can imply tons of different ways in which different commutation relations could give same classical behavior in some complicated processes as you go from quantum to classical. Especially since that rrquires many particles and so on. The argument seems very non rigorous while pretending to be. Am I wrong in thinking this?
How long should a interview/visit take with a graduate school? I am taking a big trip and I'm visiting several grad schools along the way; I want to know how long I should expect to be at each school so I can plan my trip.
Ok I've got some questions about time...

If time can be slowed by gravity and speed (relativity) why wouldn't the Big Bang have happened slowly? Knowing that all of the universes mass existed in a single point.. wouldn't it have had the gravity to slow time and therefore take really long to expand? Until of course the mass spread out enough to speed up and then once expanding so fast, slow time back down again?

Question 2

If I could stop time... wouldn't every atom around me have to stop moving therefor stop producing EM (electromagnetic waves) and everything would drop to a temperature of absolute zero... 
would this mean anything in the environment of absolute zero would really be frozen in time. Thinking that it's atoms can't move and nothing can change, really it would seem like no time would pass in its relative perspective anyway.. has it been frozen in time?

And last one..
If time slows down near a large gravitational force and light remains at the same speed... why hasn't it's distance traveled changed? It should cover the same distance in less time? Therefore creating and increase of speed right? S=d/t
Does anyone know the difference between special relativity and general relativity? Aren't they both about how gravity warps spacetime?
If I'm wanting to probably go into some industry job (hopefully in physics), is a theoretical project a good idea, or should I do something more experimental?
Are the "suvat" equations not usable at undergraduate level? 

I started my astrophysics degree a few weeks ago and when being taught the equations of uniform motion they looked completely different to how they'd been taught to me previously (as the suvat equations). Is there a major difference between the two sets of equations? 
I was reading Everett's thesis, and when he talks about measurement he describes two quantum systems A & B interacting in such a way that a correlation between them becomes stronger as time goes to infinity.

But when I look at the Schroedinger equation (or any other similar wave equation) and assume that the frequency basis is finite, then it seems like the time evolution of the system should be "roughly" periodic - in other words that there should be some kind of return to a state that's close to the initial state.  (If the frequencies are irrational relative to each other it turns into a sort of "lonely runner problem.")

Is there any work that elaborates or goes into more detail about the dynamics of measurement as interpreted in the many worlds interpretation?
How do physicists feel about mathematical physics? I'm curious if it's more along the lines of "What these mathematicians are doing is really helpful" or "These guys are wasting their time; we already know that the equations we use work."
That looks really interesting. If it helps for people intimidated by the length, the last 20 pages are references. 
Thanks for the info, I am thinking of submitting my own!
Sean Caroll is everywhere these days. Good for him, I love that guy.
How on earth do they really know any of this?
I don't feel like that video was particularly informative, for how long I spent on it...
I don't think it's right to say that the existence of stars and galaxies "depends on the properties of nothingness: empty space," because empty space is not in fact nothingness. That's what the whole video's about! 
The current astronomical theories sound to me like pre-Copernicans trying to explain why the planets move in such funny loops while maintaining that the Earth must be the center of the universe.

It seems like there's something really fucking obvious we're just not getting.
Lawrence Krauss talks about this too...

(At the risk of talking out my butt per misunderstanding):
Net energy of Universe is zero, being a flat-infinite universe where matter is "positive" energy and gravity is "negative" energy.

(At the risk of getting philosophical):
This is the only way to explain that "something" exists... if it spews from nothingness in a balanced, infinite way. (i.e. anything that "can" exist, must exists, ELSE nothing would exist)

(At the risk of sounding nitpicky):
It bugs me in videos like this when they talk about the Universe in terms of "size", because it presumes or implies finite.
Didn't Dirac  theorize 'something from nothing' theory. There is no such thing as a true vacuum. 
Unlimited negative potential energy.
You can't get something from nothing.  Nothing is a concept.  It doesn't actually exist.  The universe is created from energy.  Frequencies and vibrations.  All physical matter when looked at much closer is made up more of waveform energy than it is physical matter. 

The universe, or what I would rather term as Existence (because it is more encompassing) is created by consciousness.  We create it through intention.  If you can't grasp this it is OK.  There is no way to describe it in a cold scientific manner.  Secular science is about to run into a wall if it doesn't adapt.  

Quantum physics is getting closer to the nature of reality.
I'm quite biased. I use Mathematica almost exclusively, and I almost never touch MATLAB. Like your friend, my work is theoretical. 

I think that Mathematica is far and away the more useful program. It just does more things. For symbolic manipulations, there's just no comparison, it's basically all easier to do in Mathematica (although Maple does have some advantages here). For numerical calculations the feature sets are mostly comparable. People think MATLAB is faster in this department, but I disagree and I'll explain why later. Then, with Mathematica you get all kinds of added extra stuff, some of which is in MATLAB and some isn't: image-processing operations, native support for neural networks, pattern matching and replacement in expressions, lazy evaluation, built-in operator overloading, exact calculations, compiling programs to C, automatic tracking of accuracy/precision, and many more features.

Here's a list of some of the bigger things I've done in mathematica (although they're all small compared to a commercial code base): a program to discretize and solve a linear singular integral equation, a neural network to classify MNIST digits (I did this before Wolfram added native neural network support), a numerical computation of the signal-to-noise ratio for certain quantum optics models, and an algorithm to generate all the topologically inequivalent vacuum Feynman diagrams for an arbitrary scalar field theory.

There are, however, a number of frustrating aspects of Mathematica.

Bugs and regression are a big problem; MATLAB is a more stable platform. Wolfram is always adding new functionality to Mathematica. That's great when it brings new features relevant to your work, but it's terrible when it breaks old ones that you were using. For every major new numbered release, you can always expect that certain routines will get slower, certain integrals will now give incorrect answers, etc. So you always have to guard against these things by cross-checking answers where possible and maintaining multiple versions. There are bugs in the integration algorithm that have existed largely unchanged since Mathematica 5 or 6. The recent version 11 release slowed down some operations on matrices larger than about 2500 x 2500 by a factor of like 6. This stuff gets fixed later in minor releases, but it's annoying to have things break and then have to wait.

I think the biggest reason people prefer MATLAB, though, is because the syntax is easier and writing efficient code is closer to what they are used to. The syntax of MATLAB isn't too far from C or Python. Mathematica is a completely different paradigm. If you take MATLAB code written in the usual procedural style using control loops, iterating over elements, etc., you can port it easily to Mathematica, but usually it will be quite slow. This contributes to the perception that Mathematica is much slower than MATLAB at linear algebra, for example. To get the speed out of Mathematica, you have to become good at implementing Mathematica's functional style (using Reap[] and Sow[] to create arrays, passing vectors and matrices to functions directly rather than calling their elements, always writing things as matrix multiplication and dot products where possible rather than calling elements, etc.), using Compile[] to treat variables as numerical, not using arbitrary precision when you don't have to (In MATLAB I think if you write 1/2, it's treated as a Double, whereas in Mathematica it's has arbitrary precision), etc. It's a big shift in how you write your code and it requires a lot of care on the part of the programmer to learn new efficient habits. This is usually why if you do any kind of naive speed test, you find Mathematica is much slower than MATLAB.

Ultimately, I don't have enough experience using MATLAB for the things it's supposed to be good at to tell someone else to switch to Mathematica. But for me, every time I think I need to go out and use some other program, I end up figuring out how to do it in Mathematica, with good results so far.
MATLAB is superior for numerical methods, simulations, data analysis, and high-level programming.  Mathematica can do all those things, but if you asked 100 people that have used both extensively, I'm confident 80 to 90 would tell you MATLAB is superior for those tasks.

Mathematica is superior for *any* kind of analytical work, symbolic manipulation/analysis, etc.  Compared to Mathematica, MATLAB is woefully inadequate by comparison.  MATLAB does have a symbolic math toolbox (costs extra of course), but it's nowhere near as powerful as Mathematica, and it doesn't integrate very well with the rest of MATLAB, imho.

So it really depends what kind of calculations you will need to do.
The answers seem to pretty much contradict each other (MATLAB is better, Mathematica is better, they're both the same).

In my opinion, you shouldn't be comparing the two. They're different software with different purposes. You should know how to use both in at least a basic capacity, as well as a faster language (such as Fortran or C++).

Mathematica I use for symbolics and things suited for functional. MATLAB I use for data analysis and producing a quick, very configurable plot of a function, and sometimes even a quick simulation. Fortran I use for simulations that take 8-14 hours to finish.
Honestly, both are good for different things.  There's obviously some overlap, but each is a powerful tool.  I turn to MATLAB whenever I have problems that involve matrix algebra, and I turn to Mathematica whenever I am doing more calculus-based problems (integrals, differential equations, etc.).  I also turn to MATLAB whenever I want to write in code because it's a higher-level language that's easier to work with than, say, C++, which makes it perfect for scientific research.  That being said, it's not the fastest language at all (C++ and FORTRAN are faster), but it's good for when you want to write a program that doesn't take more than a few hours to run.   

I think your friend who thinks Mathematica is the "only way" is missing out on the benefits of MATLAB.  I use MATLAB more than Mathematica and I'm more comfortable with MATLAB; however, I understand how useful Mathematica can be in certain situations.

So in summary, it's largely a matter of preference.  I think MATLAB is easier to work with, but I'd be a fool to claim Mathematica is useless to me.  
Different tools for different jobs.

Personally I use MATLAB a lot more, mainly for analyzing experimental data and for generating numeric simulations/solutions, but when I'm doing more analytic stuff I'll use Maple.
I think you're comparing apples to oranges, MATLAB and Mathematica are different things. Mathematica is for solving math problems, especially analytic ones. MATLAB is a scripting programming language that is good at matrix operations.
As an experimentalist, I can script shit in Matlab to then run an experiment effectively with the press of a button (minus coding time). Maybe you could do this in mathematica but I think it is probably more annoying/harder. Also, I have found Matlab far more useful for analyzing real data sets. Easy to import/manipulate data. Unlike my experiences doing the same in Mathematica. 
Mathematica is a great tool for theory, but MATLAB is far superior for experimental applications. 
Kind of interesting, but I'd like to see the problem switched. Instead of worrying how to turn astrophysicists into software engineers, why not turn software engineers into astrophysicists? Some academic labs actually allocate funds for software engineers, and I'm sure software engineers would love to join teams and learn about astrophysics (meee!). Why don't labs make more of an effort to hire software engineers to work on problems?

I would suggest looking into doing PhDs in EU/NA not because of Article 50 but because it'd be an enriching, rewarding and exciting thing to do. That being said my (purely speculative and entirely uninformed) opinion is that Article 50 will have a negative impact on UK science, especially some of the more blue skies stuff.
It's too difficult to say; a lot of people indeed think science funding will deteriorate in the UK, but let's be honest here, I don't think anyone can say that at this point, at least not with enough certainty for you to base a major life decision on.

That being said, it might be worth emigrating to the EU soon because all UK citizens already living there will probably be granted permanent residence (and similarly for EU citizens in the UK).
While I'm still an undergraduate myself, I've done an internship for half a year in the US(from the Netherlands here) and it was a great experience.

I can't give you any advice regarding Article 50 and whatnot, as no one will really be able to tell what kind of consequences it will have(it might be a good safety measure but really, who knows?). But I do encourage you into looking into studying/working abroad.
Doubt it will make that much difference for Physics researchers to be honest in terms of funding; only about 1% of publicly funded Physics research in the UK comes from the EU according to the IoP.

With that said, you're too early to decide whether you want to do a PhD anyway; at the very least you need to wait two years and see if you actually like it, as you've only completed one year. I had tons of friends who thought at the end of their first year that they wanted to do PhDs and hardly any of them actually ended up starting them. Once you've finished third year is when you need to start thinking about it, and by that time we'll probably have much more clarity on how Brexit will affect collaborations, funding, etc.
If you want to do a PhD in the EU then do it.  Concerns over Brexit or politics really shouldn't enter into it.
Use a resistive sensor instead, they are very cheap and quite accurate.
That is a lot of detail to try to sort out for you.  I can say to Q1 the digits on the display usually only relate to a devices *best case* noise floor.  So if you have a measurement box that produces 4 digits, it's possible that only one setting with a heavy filter and lots of samples might get you close to 4 digits.  I've seen more and more cheaper test and measurement devices these days that produce more digits than the limits of their noise floor too.

While I can't go through all the details you're specifically asking, perhaps these references might help you some.

https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/calibrations/sp250-35.pdf

Your repeatibility is probably being limited by the accuracy of the cold junction sensor inside the box.  If so stablilizing the box temperature would probably improve your results.
As a practicing physicist in the real world I would say that python is a godsend.  Learn that and you'll be able to solve just about anything you come across. After spending years using Fortran, c++, and root on a HEP experiment I wish I could go back and do it over with python. 
>1) do physicists actually do this, do they build the code themselves or does this code exists already for anyone to use.

Yes, all the time. For something simple, you can just write your own. For a major project, you'll probably use a software package someone else developed (unless of course, you're the kind of physicist who likes to write these kinds of major packages).

>2) what are the common 'just build a program to solve it' problems, equations, formulae etc that are solved this way.

Basically everything, at least in my experience working in experimental nuclear physics. As you get further and further into undergrad, you start to realize how few physical problems are really solvable analytically. For everything else, you rely on computation.

A recent example for me was that I needed to know what fraction of gamma rays are emitted within some solid angle from a moving source as a function of its speed.

I tried to work out the probability density function analytically in some scribbles on a notepad. After about five minutes, I just decided to write a quick Monte Carlo code instead.
It is not uncommon in physics and engineering to need to do specialized calculations over and over again.  Many sub-disciplines have developed computational features for their specific field.

Here are a few quick examples.

[Astronomy](http://www.astropython.org/)

[Machine Learning for Astronomy](http://www.astroml.org/)

[Signal processing](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html)

[Fermi even has their only Linux distro](https://fermilinux.fnal.gov/)

However you might want to start by learning how to do numerical solutions to ODE's or other types of common math problems before you start trying to apply them to specific areas.

[Here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/) is a book on Computational Physics in Python.  Python has a lot of different tools for scientists.  All of the exercises for the book are made available by the author.  My upper division physics course in computational methods in physics is using this book.  This is also a great resource for learning how to solve integrals and derivatives without analytic solutions numerically.  
I was what you would call a computational physicist. I developed algorithms, ran massive simulations analyzed complex datasets to study how nanoparticle's self assemble into crystal structures. Pretty much you will either work in a lab or write code as a physicist, it's up to you.
Yes we do.
Some of us, like me, even specialize in it. I'm currently on my last master's year and I'm working on writting simulation code. As said on the thread, python is very famous on this field, although I just use it for prototyping nowadays
I'm like you, and came into physics with a strong background in hands on programming. I use it every day. It's like having a great tool in your toolbox that not everyone else has. Being really good at math also helps. 

There are math courses on numerical analysis that help tremendously with computation for physics, and not all physicists get that training, so consider it. It's the difference between doing something and knowing what you're doing--well enough that you can write about it. 

Don't forget that computation is not only used for modeling (we do that a lot), it's also used for data analysis. Experimental data doesn't analyze itself. You often have to treat it in special ways to extract the most, and the correct, information from it. Image processing is a major field in microscopy and many many fields. People are just starting to figure out how to handle terabytes of data now coming from their experiments Per Day.

You'd be amazed how many engineers in their 40s and 50s don't know how to use anything but Excel. It's almost tragic that that level of programming innumeracy is acceptable. It's commonplace and it gives you a competitive advantage if you're fluent in programming. 
I have a bachelor's in physics and I've done several simulations professionally.

As others mentioned, Numerical Recipes is a great book. Literally generations of physicists have regarded it as the bible.

There are several physics tool kits available. Geant4 is probably my favorite. It simulates quantum field physics in fields and materials. I've used it to simulate active,radiation shields, the alpha magnetic spectrometer, and various radiation detectors.

Recently, I wrote a simulation of the inner solar system using a leap frog variant of the rk4 algorithm. Later I processed the orbits in order to leant how,to do fast Fourier transforms. All this without a kit, including making my own vector objects. I highly recommend this project.

To get my rk4 right, I first coded a pendulum using the actual nonlinear equation of motion for a pendulum as opposed,to the usual small angle approximation.

There are as many projects as there are equations if motion. 
I can confirm that 90% of my research is done in mathematica, and once I started doing that almost all of my involved physics problems in assignments for my upper year undergrad courses were done almost exclusively in mathematica. 

If it was very matrix heavy and didn't require differential equations sometimes I used MATLAB.
Probably more suited for /r/askphysics.

For something as simple as Fourier transform, there are numerous libraries out there that implement these methods. Even for more complicated stuff, there are commercial software packages that do a wide variety of simulations, such as fluids, molecular dynamics, electromagnetics, and heat transfer. But these commercial software packages are often geared towards industry users, who have somewhat predictable and standard needs in their simulations. When you start needing custom features, multi-physics simulations, or larger control over your code, then you are forced to code your own thing. For example, solving the heat equation is pretty straightforward, and there are plenty of free code online. But if you want to start incorporating hysteretic phase changes or other nonlinear effects, then it'll be much harder to get this out of an available piece of code, so you'll need to build your own. 
In certain parts of experimental physics, a significant number of man hours go into developing data acquisition systems to control experiments and take data from them.

Beyond that, almost all nontrivial data analysis involves programming in some form. Our experiment has repositories full of codes which analysis all kinds of data, do all kinds of complicated curve fitting and make all of our pretty plots.

To design experiments and evaluate systematics, we have our own monte carlo packages.

Probably the single most common thing thing we have to do is fit various curves. This might seem trivial, but when you get to fitting nonlinear things to noisy data in a robust way or you want to get the best possible number out there is quite a lot of optimisation that can go on, even if the actual least squares fit is done by a built in package.

If you want to practice, I'd just say to learn numpy and scipy. In whatever labs you take, go overboard on the data analysis.
It's a whole field of it's own these days. Some would even argue that there are now 3 branches of science: theoretical, experimental, computational (running simulations or data-crunching).


If you like programming, or even better (applied) computer science. Have a look at scientific computing/computational {science,physics}. I have a bachelor's degree in Physics and am about to finish my master's in computational science.  Where in my bachelor's I took a few CS courses for fun my schedule now is a mix-and-match of graduate CS courses and physics. 

I'm focusing on High-performance computing mostly (Taking courses on CS subjects like 'distributed systems', 'computer architecture' and 'parallel programming' as well as courses on numerical methods and their applications), others are focusing on more applied physics, and I know of other programs which are basically 'the mathematics of numerical methods'.

Personally I really like what I have learned so far and I think it was the right choice for me, but there is relatively little mention of it in most bachelor programs I think. Just mentioning it in case this turns out to be something you might wish to pursue. 
I strongly recommend starting with Python, and for your purposes, working through some problems at https://projecteuler.net/ .


Yes. I write all of my own code and actually use Fourier transforms a lot.

I highly recommend seeking out a research assistantship with a professor at your university, and then applying for summer programs elsewhere. When I was an undergrad many years ago. I did four different research projects in three different countries, and I was paid for all of them. It's amazing what's available if you're motivated and seek it out. At the time, I was doing astrophysics (now I do experimental physics), and during those research programs I got to go observing at two of the biggest telescopes in the world as well as others. They were some of the best years of my life, and I learned so much, especially programming.
I would recommend getting Fowle's Analytical Mechanics. The thing with solving physics problems with a computer is that you still need to set the problem up yourself. This book is all about the setting up of problems, and it also goes over ways to solve them (using mathematica) at the end of each chapter.
Hope this is at least tangentially relevant, but I suggest you try your hand at using Mathematica. There is a small learning curve, but after using it for a while I find that I love it. Definitely a great computational program for solving and modeling physics problems. It's a super fun learning tool, in my opinion.
You might be interested in reading about the physics modeling and numerical calculation that went into the snow simulation in the movie Frozen.
We had a generic computational physics course in undergrad, done in C, with examples like numerical integration, differential equation solving, etc. It was a good broad intro to this stuff.

Pretty much everything I've been doing since I got into particle physics is writing code to do collision event reconstruction. A lot of the time the basic code exists but requires modification, sometimes it needs a lot more work.

In my time I've done a lot of outreach work with school students, and most of the time they are surprised that everyone spends a fair bit of time coding.
Just so you're aware OP, your skillset would do very well in video games if you ever decided to pursue a different career path. :)
i recommend you get a book about computational physics, that will teach you several useful algorithms and will have examples to apply them. fast fourier transform is one of them (it's fourier transform but implemented in a non-naive way that makes it feasible to do.. because it's fast enough).
Many materials simulations programs are "atomistic" in character, that is, they simulate the behaviours of atoms in the system of interest. This can be done using either classical mechanics or quantum mechanics.

It is quite feasible to write your own programs based on classical mechanics (for example, molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations). The quantum mechanical programs are usually group efforts.

Whether you write your own code, or use someone else's, the real skill is to extract the quantity of interest from the program output. For example, if you have a dump of atomic positions and velocities at various times, you might wish to extract a macroscopic quantity such as an elastic constant or the viscosity. This requires both physics knowledge and an ability to program.
Someday I'd like to see a computational "genetic algorithm" that attempts to solve physics.  I mean like a computer program that makes up semi-random equations out of the various physical constants and known operators and such and uses the rules of natural selection to determine which ones are closer to fitting reality and then "mating" those together in some way that produces viable offspring.  I dunno, someone smarter than me will have to work out the details.  But hey, maybe that's how we'll solve string theory?
Much has been written already.

For your (2) though, I would suggest looking into simple demonstration problems.  Of course, you've seen people do them already, but that doesn't mean they're not useful to do.

Here's a fun one: orbital mechanics -- try to do a numerical solution for a simple orbit.  There's a reasonable chance you'll find your orbit diverges, which means you get to figure out how to fix it :)
Short answer: yes. 

If, for example, you're looking at a galaxy that is 4 million lightyears away, that means it has taken light emitted by the galaxy 4 million years to reach your pupil. Obviously the galaxy has continued to age in that 4 million years that the light was traveling but we haven't seen that light yet (its still traveling). Another way to think about it, to know exactly what a galaxy 4 million light years away is doing RIGHT NOW, you'd have to check back in 4 million years once the light has arrived. 

I'm sure there are plenty of other people out there who can give better examples/explain more eloquently, but there ya go. Hope it helps.

edit: typo
There's more to it...

The more distant a galaxy, the faster it is moving relative to us. As a consequence of relativity, we know that the faster something moves relative to us, the less it ages relative to us. As these more distant galaxies approach the speed of light (or the speed of causality),  they barely age relative to us. So the images we see of remote galaxies are of "young" galaxies.

Even more mind boggling: This also means that the matter that we're composed of is actually older than the matter that makes up the distant galaxies, from our perspective. And from the perspective of a remote galaxy, all of this is opposite; we're the remote galaxy that barely ages, etc.

since there's no global time, it makes no sense to say "what is that star looking like RIGHT NOW, we only see the light it sent out YEARS AGO". both of these statements pretend there's universal time. for all intents and purposes right now, i.e. our present, is what we can see now (light reaching us now is what stuff looks like *now*).

yet, regarding your question, what people mean by that is that the light travelled a non zero distance to reach us.
This is not unique to stars or anything else. Since light takes some amount of time to reach you, you are always looking at the past (from your point of view). So when you look at yourself in the mirror you are seeing yourself some very small fraction of a second in the past.
Yup.  In fact the state of a substance based on the temperature (which is how we usually think of things changing state) and pressure is usually graphed in something called a phase diagram.  Take a look: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram 
That depends on the liquid. Water is denser as a liquid than a solid so you get the opposite, you can take ice and compress it to a liquid as in this chart. http://serc.carleton.edu/images/research_education/equilibria/h2o_phase_diagram_-_color.v2.jpg

But if you have ethanol, than the solid is denser than the liquid so adding pressure will cause the liquid to form a solid. shown here
http://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/phaseeqia/pdco2.gif
Also notice that the effect of pressure is much greater on the gas liquid transition than it is for the liquid solid transition. 

edit. posted the same graph twice
depends on the material. for most it does happen that way, while for water pressure can turn ice into liquid water.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phase-diag2.svg

here is a phase diagramm. it shows what phase a material is depending on temperature and pressure.

the solid green line applies to normal materials.

if you are at a temperature slightly to the right of  Ttp or simply to the right of the triple point. when the pressure is low you are in the vapour phase. as you go higher you go to liquid and then to solid.


the dotted green line however gives the anomalous behaviour of water. you can be in the solid phase(slightly to the left of the triple point. here increasing the pressure enough puts you into the liquid phase. this is what causes slipping on ice. standing on it increases the pressure it melts a little bit of it, which you then slip on.

Sometimes. Some gases, e.g. Oxygen cannot even be liquified without cooling.
What happens at the centre of the Earth?  Is the iron core solid or liquid?
Yes metallic hydrogen. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen
The source is very small, which can potentially allow very focused beams if the momentum spread is not too large. I could imagine that the big colliders are interested in that technology as well to focus the beams even better.

> At present, proton beams are produced in conventional accelerators. In contrast, laser-generated proton beams open the door to the development of novel, perhaps even cheaper and more efficient, methods of treatment.

It is worth mentioning that there are more than 10,000 particle accelerators around, while they used *the* most powerful laser here. And focussing such a laser beam on a target in the human body will be ... very challenging.

Do you have any context you want to add to this paper and how it relates to the current state of the field, or tell us why you find it interesting beyond the cool-sounding name?
Why am I getting downvoted? Should I have posted this in a different thread?
Quantum is certainly an option.  You'll probably want to learn some linear algebra first, though some books (e.g., Shankar) have a sufficient introduction on their own.

I would shy away from statistical mechanics until after quantum.

Alternatively, Electromagnetism, or special relativity are options
At my college, the prereq for QM is a course on oscillations/waves. It's suggested that students are co-enrolled in a statistical physics course while they take QM. A solid knowledge of differential equations won't hurt either!
I do not have a copy of Taylor's text on hand.  Do the "essential chapters" include Hamiltonian mechanics?  How did you fare with the differential equations in the course?

If you are fine with those topics, then Quantum Mechanics is actually a reasonable next course of study for you.  I suggest Griffiths' textbook if you can get your hands on it cheaply.
did you study analytical mechanics (ie hamiltonian / lagrangian mechanics)?

if you didn't, do that before going to quantum mechanics.

otherwise classical electrodynamic / special relativity may be topics.
Copy/pasting (with minor changes) from [my response on a recent /r/AskScience thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/54uepk/why_cant_scientists_reach_absolute_zero/).

You need to do some work on your system to extract heat from it. If you do an amount of work W to extract an amount of heat Q*_c_* from your system, initially at temperature T*_c_*, then you will need to dump an amount of heat

Q*_h_* = W + Q*_c_*

into the surroundings, which are at some hotter temperature T*_h_*.

In thermodynamics, the entropy change associated with adding or removing an amount of heat Q from a system at temperature T is

ΔS = ΔQ/T

The second law of thermo says that the total entropy must stay the same or increase, always. Then your process of cooling down your system will need to satisfy

-Q*_c_*/T*_c_* + Q*_h_*/T*_h_* ≥ 0

The inequality is saturated when you're cooling the system down with a heat pump running a reversed [Carnot cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_cycle). Rewriting this in terms of W,

W ≥ Q*_c_* (T*_h_*/T*_c_* - 1)

So as the temperature T*_c_* gets closer to absolute zero, the amount of work you need to do to extract heat gets larger, asymptotically reaching infinity at absolute zero.
Also, if you could, would that make whatever is at absolute zero invisible?
As a thought experiment, a system at absolute zero cannot have any force applied to it, even an infinitesimally small amount. Imagine just how far any massive object would need to be from the system to achieve this. 
First of all temperature, as I'm sure you know considering you mentioned degenerate ground states, is an expression of kinetic energy essentially. Due to "quantum jitters" nothing will ever be completely stationary at the quantum level, and if it was you wouldn't even be able to be certain about it. There's probably a number of reasons, but very basically at the atomic level I don't think it could be done even in theory. 
The intuitive explanation that I've always heard relies on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Since temperature depends on the motion of an object's constituent molecules, an object at absolute zero would have no motion and no kinetic energy. This is impossible according to Heisenberg because a molecule that doesn't move at all has no uncertainty in position, so there always must be some kind of motion in order to adhere to the uncertainty principle, no matter how cold the object is. I could be completely wrong on this, so don't take my word for it.
So the simplest answer is to realize temperature represents internal energy of particles randomly flying around interacting, and at 0 k the thermal motion of the particles would stop altogether, but this is a classical conclusion, whereas quantum mechanics  implies heisenberg uncertainty, you cannot know exactly its momentum and position, so the particles would seem to be vibrating a small amount (quantum uncertainty) upon measurement, and also have spin,  and also that any system we make is not truly 'closed'  if you look close enough. Any change you make in your system, nature will work to do the opposite anyways to balance things out.
The same reason you can't take something with mass up to the speed of light!
I'm pretty sure it's theoretically possible.  It's just really really hard.
The easiest and shortest explanation is to say it would be like trying to get it infinitely hot in reverse.
How do I download it? 
Do what you want to. People tend to major in physics because they enjoy it and like to learn about and understand the world. Don't major in something because someone told you to or because they came up with an argument for why it's "better" than the alternatives. You have to figure out what you want for yourself out of life first. You may not have that figured out yet (and that's OK too). In the meantime, learn, grow, try new things, and pursue what you enjoy. It sounds like you may enjoy physics.

Also, you are being rather premature and presumptuous making comments like "My grades can probably get me into med school." You're only in high school now. After you get into college nobody will care what your high school grades are. Classes are going to be a lot harder in college, so just because you're easily getting straight As now does not guarantee you'll get good grades in college.

Edit: I am assuming you are in the US. I realize that in some parts of the world students can apply to and enter medical school directly out of high school.
I'm worried about the reasons you are asking this question - it seems like you want to study physics but have trouble defending it to either yourself (you don't deem it worthy) or to your parents (who don't think you will get a good job.)

As an undergrad, I can't give you the full perspective, but I can at least tell you this: in my experience with physics and math, people fall into one of two categories.

First, there are people who really enjoy physics and math but maybe aren't extremely talented or just don't want to go into a life of academia. After undergrad some may get a PhD but most use their degree(s) to get a decent job. My understanding is that most of these people do well in life and are happy, as the jobs you can secure with a physics or math degree are fairly lucrative.

The second category (and the one I'm in) are the people who not only enjoy the stuff but also want to dedicate their life to it. For most the question of "why study physics?" is sort of a non starter. We want to do things that are interesting, and physics can provide us with the financial means to survive, so why not? If you are questioning why you want to study physics, this probably means that you are not a part of this second category (or, it means that you haven't studied enough physics and haven't seen how awesome it truly is, in which case I envy you!). If you are trying to defend yourself from your parents, and you are struggling to come up with a reason, then you are probably a part of this category. To this I would tell your parents that becoming a physics researcher will not make you absurdly rich, but if you do a good job you will make a decent amount of money, get a decent car, send your kids to good schools, etc. BUT you would also get the added benefit of a fulfilling life, something that most people don't get.

But don't stress out too much about this. It sounds like you are a freshman in college so your first year you are probably taking general courses - abuse this time to learn more about physics, go to the library and pick out books that look interesting, knock on professor's doors and ask them questions (presumably good questions, and be polite!). The world is your oyster!
I probably wouldn't study physics to go into medicine.

If you want a math and science heavy degree with a focus on physics maybe consider engineering.

You could study physics if academics and research are appealing to you.
BS in Physics here.
With physics or medicine, you will need an advanced degree to do much of anything with in the real world.

I fell backwards into physics from engineering and now while I still have a very deep love for science, I have a programming job.

Physics pairs nicely with mathematics and makes for a very logical double major if you want to work towards a master's or PhD in astrology or something research based. If you want to go into coding, you might want to throw in some CS courses in there too.

Physics pairs with chemistry once you get into looking at the molecular models and atomic bonds. It's basically advanced quantum mechanics (also math heavy). I had a couple of friends who double majored with this and they all went on to pursue advanced degrees and are now doing cancer research or similar. 

Happy to answer any other questions you may have! Good luck and don't forget toenjoy your journey!!
Major in physics if it's what you love. Sure you might not make a doctors salary but how happy you are is more important than how much is in your bank account. 
First year undergrad in Physics here, based in the UK (I assume from the mention of AS levels, you are in the UK too). Here's a few reasons why I chose physics:
All through school and including sixth form, Maths was my  favourite subject - I even did better in A level maths than physics. However, my favourite parts of physics were better than any maths lesson - when I saw a connection between the equations I was using and the world around me. I knew that a physics degree would be heavily maths based, so I went for it. I have absolutely no regrets. 

Med school is fine, one or two of my friends went/plan on going and if you enjoy it, then it's a fantastic degree to get. But that's the key - *if you enjoy it*. Physics is very employable (more so in the UK than the US), with people going into finance, engineering, research, teaching, outreach, business, among others. I did a weeks work experience with an aerospace company and the people I met were graduates from a whole manner of STEM degrees - not just engineering. 

What I'm trying to say is, if you enjoy it, the physics is a fantastic degree to get. If you don't enjoy it then it will be three or four years of hard work which you have no motivation for. 

Quick word on joint degrees - they can be excellent in providing a range of skills and will always open a lot of doors, particularly in subjects like physics and maths with skills applicable to other fields. I wouldn't recommend doing a joint degree in chemistry. (Disclaimer: did A level chemistry, hated every minute of it)
I'm 2/3 of the way through my PhD in theoretical physics. 

The reason I got there is because I followed my passion. But no matter what you do in life, you will be hit by moments of regret, confusion and doubt. No choice will ever seem perfect. I think most of us realize that, but what's great about physics is that it's a stepping stone for most other advanced disciplines. You can have an MSc in theoretical physics as a base and go on to do other things more easily than vice versa. 

Do physics if you like the sense of deep meaning and understanding, but remember, don't be afraid to change topic after you feel like you've had your share of physics :)

Best of luck, 

PS: never forget though, don't take life too seriously:There are no right or wrong choices and don't think of a choice as terribly important, because in the end it is not.

... I'd like to add that at the moment I have no clue what I want to do after I finish my PhD. I've had a rough time the last few years, both because of influences from outside of physics, but also because research in theoretical physics is not very compatible with a normal lifestyle.
Major in physics if you want to do some kind of research in a physics area, some random terms for you(quantum computing, optics, semiconductors, solid state, nuclear physics), its possible to go to med school to become someone who treats cancer with radiation or studies that method, studying imaging methods MRI, NMR. Really employers wont know what you can do, but you will probably learn or should learn along the journey: data analysis through labs you do, high level math, the ability to problem solve, some programming. I major in physics preparing for mechanical/aerospace engineering. I wish i had gone pure engineering, my school is not a tech school i am stuck taking a core curriculum.
[deleted]
I'll just throw in a little bit here, I don't know what you should personally go for (only you will be able to figure that out) but these careers you are currently deciding between all take A LOT of commitment. Even if you're naturally great at it, awesome, but this shit is hard work no matter what. So firstly you need to be passionate enough in whatever you go into. This is the most important thing. From what you've said that sounds like physics for you and even if you change your mind you can get a lot of different positions with a physics degree. If you do decide physics, I think your idea to double major with math is a great idea. That is what I am currently doing, actually - the reasoning being getting a physics degree already gives you a math minor automatically, so why not step it up, and because no matter where you end up in these fields it will all go back to math anyway. Math is everything.

Good luck with your decision, and if you really like physics-related books I would also recommend Michio Kaku (Hyperspace, in particular) and Brian Greene, to start.


Be your own person and don't let your parents tell you what to major in.
Because is fun!
There really is no such thing as friction, there is just some aggregate interaction between an object and a medium that we call friction.

For example compare... 

a spacecraft enters the atmosphere and heats up slowing down, why? Drag (aka friction with the air)... vs

a sailboat at a deadstop unfurls it's sail and accelerates across the ocean, why? Wind.

Why is one called wind and the other called drag? What is the difference? From the frame of reference where the ship is at rest both are wind.

So sure friction could exceed the force applied, but then we wouldn't call it friction anymore. We would label it something else.

This is pay of why friction is hard to understand, especially static friction (which only exists when you push on something, and never seems to exceed the force you apply).
I'm not sure I understand your question...do you mean the force normal to the surface or the force you are trying to push the object with parallel to the surface
What would it take for that to happen? We can say the force of friction is proportional to the weight of the object in question, and friction will oppose a push force. So an object that gains mass quickly relative to force applied would push back. Hard to imagine such a thing, but fun to think about.
This would be a violation of Newton's third law because the frictional force would be greater than the applied force.  Not to mention that kinetic friction always goes against the direction of motion
Great video, /u/MrPennywhistle! I remember watching it a few days ago when YouTube popped it up on my subscription list. Very fortunate to be flying with them in T38s :) 

Btw, a clothoid curve (technically known as an Euler Spiral) is what they use for roller coasters, highway on/off ramps & street intersections; without it, cars would be skidding tangentially off highway ramps. 

http://theconstructor.org/transportation/horizontal-transition-curves-highways/11271/
And I'm jealous. Awesome video!
Clothoids are incredibly cool, they're my favorite curve! That one you showed would be more appropriately called a clothoid loop, made out of clothoid spiral segments.

This curve is used because its curvature changes linearly with arclength. Physically, this translates to the rate of change in acceleration being constant as you travel around it, so the transition is "nice and predictable".

It's super useful whenever you need smooth transitions. This is why these curves are used in (good) road design when they need to merge curves.

Since they're so visually pleasing, there's some really cool research about using clothoids as the canonical spline interpolation curve in computer graphics, but it never caught on because Bézier and cubic splines are simpler. Clothoids look much more natural, which is why they have been used for designing [French curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_curve) for years. [It's also used extensively in violin design](http://zhurnal.lib.ru/m/muratow_s_w/violin_design.shtml)

It also shows up in optics when you are dealing with diffraction and interference patterns due to an aperture. You approximate your electromagnetic field by a scalar complex valued field that encodes phase and amplitude information at every point in space. In order to find the intensity at another point in space, you need to integrate over the entire region of the aperture, and the changes in phase due to different path lengths end up producing a clothoid spiral when you add up the complex values across every point in the plane. (Then you can move between these planes for other surfaces). Back in the days, [people used to compute diffraction using the spirals themselves](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/cornu.html)! The same math applies to Feynman's path integrals, so this can also be used in quantum mechanics.

The curve is also the solution to the "[elastica problem](http://www.levien.com/phd/elastica_hist.pdf)", which is related to the general problem of finding the shape things bend into under force. Euler has come up with a family of solutions that are all intimately connected with clothoids.

So yeah, it's the coolest curve!
Oohhh man, i am a huge fan of your videos, you're actually one of the people who inspired me to become an engineer, something I'm working on right now, thank you for making these videos
Destin, you're awesome! I wish more people are more into science like you!! Keep up the YouTube videos! I am a fan! 
Anytime I'm struggling in school I watch his videos, such an amazing attitude for learning. 
Ohhhhh man, I'm so jealous. I'd donate my left kidney for one of these flights. 
i love you and your channel
That's one more than I thought they had.
"US left with just one working fusion reactor"

That is just plain incorrect. Even if you limit things to only magnetic confinement devices, ignore the many inertial confinement experiments at the national labs, and a number of private startup companies, there are still many in operation in the US.

*[Hybrid Illinois Device for Research and Applications (HIDRA)](http://cpmi.illinois.edu/category/research-projects/plasma-science/) at the University of Illinois

*[Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX)](http://www.hsx.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison

*[Madison Symmetric Torus (MST)](http://plasma.physics.wisc.edu/viewpage.php?id=mst) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison

*DIII-D at General Atomics

*[Pegasus Toroidal Experiment](http://pegasus.ep.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison


I'm so happy I'm lucky enough to be working on DIII-D. I do wish the US funded fusion/plasma research at home more though! The Alcator C shutdown makes me sad.
How is fusion ever going to make net energy? Can someone explain that?
I would rather see 'them' take ALL the subsidies away from poisonous fission nuke plants, and put that money into fusion research. (phase fission out...)

We've really got our priorities backwards.
DOES IT WORK AT COLD TEMPERATURES
What good were the other reactors?  What the fuck is so cool about this one?  Another reason why we need lower taxes.
This can be a confusing issue. For example, Craig Callender at UC San Diego wrote: "When we look to cosmology for information about the actual Past State, we find early cosmological states that appear to be states of very high entropy, not very low entropy. Cosmology tells us that the early universe is an almost homogeneous isotropic state of approximately uniform temperature, i.e. a very high entropy state."  And Paul Davies, now at U of Arizona, wrote: "At first sight it appears paradoxical that an element of the cosmological fluid can start out in a quasi-equilibrium condition, and yet still increase in entropy at later epoch."  But Roger Penrose in the late 1970s argued that in the early universe, a high entropy state is not smooth at all but an inhomogeneous one; the density of matter is large and gravity is hugely important.

So in the video Sean Carroll explains why the early universe is a low-entropy state, along the way talking about gravitational effects, the Jeans' length, etc.

The most relevant paper I could find on this topic (quick search) is [Entropy and Gravity](http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/14/12/2456/pdf).  The above Callender and Davies quotes are from this paper.
Err, although I agree with most of what he is saying, I think he goofed by claiming that gravitational degrees of freedom are not true degrees of freedom... They most certainly are! And that was Penrose's whole point. The gravitational degrees of freedom that are truly independent from the matter degrees of freedom are those quantified by the Weyl conformal tensor, which *was*, in fact, very close to zero (all components) near the Big Bang. This is exactly why Penrose always argued that there should be a way of directly relating Weyl curvature to gravitational entropy.

Or am I missing something?
He wrote a book about it! "From Eternity to Here". It's probably one of my favorite books on the topic!
Feinstein is not going to like this.
Awesome, looking forward to this.
Are there any pre requisets one should brush up on before attempting this? Or will math skills get me through it? Mo knowledge mo bitches amirite? 
Damn. If only I wasn't still in high school this would be one of the coolest things I've ever seen. 
Did a little digging for you. Anything you want to know is likely found here: http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12062/nsf12062.jsp#hisp

Note, it is from 2012, but I imagine not much has changed as far as what you asked goes. 

"I am a new Fellow, and in my application I proposed a specific research project; do I now have to do that specific project?

No, not as long as your degree program and research project both remain in the same major FOS proposed in your application and there is no minor FOS change. If there is a minor FOS change in either the degree program or research project, it is subject to the approval of the CO, using the GRFP FastLane Module."
Fellow here, no you're not at all obligated to - or even expected to - follow through with your research proposal. Hell, until this year you didn't even have to go into the same field that you wrote your proposal in (for instance, switching from physics to biology; you can still go from subfield to subfield, say condensed matter to astrophysics). They're more so interested in your ability to formulate a research project. They aren't looking for ground breaking proposals, just a purely hypothetical, original project that would yield a small contribution to your field.

If you have any more questions feel free to respond or PM; deadlines are obviously coming soon.
i fuckin love lenny's grumpy old man-isms. and he has a point too- ive seen a lot of bad talks which sucked because the speaker relied on their pre-prepared slides... the blackboard forces you to know your shit by heart and be more engaged... but maybe i only think this because im an old man at heart too
All you do is press buttons!?  Anti-technology rants really irk me...  A computer based presentation gives you so many tools to teach that were not available before, like showing videos and accurately portraying detailed graphics.  It just comes across as "They gave me this increased ability to portray information to my listeners, but that would require me to expand my horizons and teach myself some new techniques."
Unsure if this even makes sense, but how do we know time actually *has* two directions? Is there such a thing as a dimension with only a single direction?

Why is it that we are "pushed" through time by default, at a specific rate in a way which we are not pushed through space?
This really doesn't explain anything about why.

 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/33435)
To my mind it is strange that quantum mechanics is not proclaimed to set the arrow of time. This is my reasoning:

In any classical system (i.e. classically described system) - like a ball thrown in the air - sure(!) the laws doesn't care about what direction time runs. Throw a ball and follows a parabola somewhat modified by air resistance, bounces as it hits the floor and rolls into a corner. Running time backwards for all positions and momentums of every particle in the system would make the ball start rolling out of the corner bounce a few times and take a path of an almost-parabola back to your hand. With the caveat that entropy says that the likelihood of that happening is beyond never-ever-ever-in-the-lifetime-of-the-universe gonna happen!

However this reasoning seems to be fundamentally impossible to do in a QM system. Let me use the most simple example I can think of. Put a (well localised) particle in a box and wait for some given suitable time, until the particle has a spread out spectrum of superpositions in position-space. Then measure the position of the particle and you will (instantaneously) collapse the wave function to be contained within some narrow position interval in the box (where you happen to find the particle!). Now, when you try to run this system backwards in time, like above, you're super-fine until you encounter the moment where the wave function collapsed (as time was running forwards). To my knowledge there is no process that can instantaneously un-collapse a wave function. Or is there??

Does anyone see where I go wrong in this reasoning? I'm pretty sure I'm not the first one who tried to do this argument and got thoroughly shot down and had to tuck their tail firmly between their legs.
Entropy, kashira?
This would be quite a thread in any sub.

Yeah, I don't buy it.  
  
In a 'Big Crunch' scenario, where entropy decreases, will time flow backwards?   
  
nope,  
  
in a nearly totally empty isolated system, with one atom of Caesium-133, with no possible increase in entropy, will time stop?  
  
?
Would it not 'flow' forward for the same reason you cannot go backwards in space, or travel at a negative speed. 

In space whatever direction you go you are going forward, with velocity whatever direction that velocity is, it is always forward.

If you could travel backwards in space, and at negative speed, you could have negative time, and it would look exactly the same!
Is Morse and Fesbach's Methods of Theoretical Physics still a good resource today? 
I'd love a quick a dirty density functional theory summary, relating the major codes of today (VASP, GAUSSIAN, ESPRESSO, etc), pseudopotentials, and the various XC functionals.
I've become greatly interested in geometric concepts in physics. I would like some opinions on these text for self study. If there are better options, please share.

Also, what are good texts for Geometric Electrodynamics that includes spin geometry? 
Currently in my final year of my undergraduate degree I've taken a strong interest in modern optics and laser physics. I'm currently trying to decide between going into medical physics or pursuing optics but I suppose that's irrelevant. I was wondering if anyone knew any good resources for laser engineering or quantum optics. 
I'm looking for some additional resources on Solid State, particular any excellent lecture notes or videos. Topics we are covering seem to be in the order of Kittel, but I have access to Marder and Ashcroft Merlin.

I'm especially interested in things that give more historical context, as well as talk about broad applications since those sorts of things help me with memory hooks.
I currently a teach a course in modern physics for non-physics majors. I have finished teaching relativity and quantum physics, and I plan to teach condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics next. What books and/or articles (which are accessible online) would you recommend which gives a conceptual introduction on the two fields, especially on the following topics: temperature, entropy, and phase changes?
I'm taking physics for scientists and engineers, but I need a book that will help me solve problems similar to what we learn in class. The textbook we use has numbers, but most in lecture most problems my professor solves without numbers.

He said exams won't have any numbers, and it'll all be deriving equations and whatnot for example he would sometimes use 3 - 4 equations to solve for the unknowns, all without numbers. Is there a book that does things similar to that? I really need help 
Anyone know of any good resources to bridge the gap between popular science books and the more detailed, mathematical kind. I was looking at Susskind's 'The Theoretical Minimum' books and Penrose's 'The Road to Reality'. Are they good for this purpose?
The article acts like we can't currently use visible light in imaging. We already do, though it is different than what is shown here. It is called Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and it relies on backscattered light.  It does have issues with depth, but you can get pictures with high resolution: http://biomedicaloptics.spiedigitallibrary.org/data/Journals/BIOMEDO/935286/JBO_21_5_050902_f013.png
The fact is, there's no 'there' there. Thad Roberts does not have a theory. He has a collection of intuitive ideas, based on some physics.

He's published 0 papers on his theory. He's uploaded nothing to the ArXiv that I can find. The 'Formalism' section of his website is just a very quick introduction to 3 or 4 well-known relations (having to do with BEC, etc.), plus one extra thing he calls a new generalization, but doesn't fully define. There's no complete mathematical formalism given for how his theory works, just some bits and pieces thrown in with a short, heuristic explanation.

I will give 2 well-known problems with theories like this one. First, initial-value-problems for wave-equations with more than 1 time dimension are generally ill-posed. Ill-posed here means that either a solution does not exist, multiple solutions exist, or solutions react discontinuously to small changes.The second problem is that there are already strong experimental constraints on the size of any additional dimensions of space. Roberts hasn't said exactly how his extra dimensions work, but he has to explain either why his theory is compatible with these results, or why they don't apply. I haven't seen anything that addresses either of these problems.
without having a look at the larger code, it is hard to give you a more certain answer. However, I can give you my best guess as to what the code snippet you posted is asking:

First off, any line beginning with % is a comment in matlab and won't be executed. In this section, there are two lines that let you define wavelength, the second one is commented out. When you specify the dimensions of your problem, you have to choose a unit. The first option is setting 
    wavelength = 1

which means that all of the lengths you specify in your measurement need to be in units of the wavelength. e.g. if your wavelength is 660nm and the flake you are simulating is 1320nm in diameter, then you would specify that diameter as being 2 wavelengths. 

Alternatively, you can specify everything in some other standard unit. To do that, you would comment out the wavelength=1 line and uncomment 

    wavelength = wavelength0 / n_medium

where wavelength0 is your wavelength in nm (or any other unit) and n_medium = 1 for vacuum. Then you would specify the other parameters of your simulation in the same units that you used for the wavelength.

Then, whatever results you get will also be in whichever units you select. This is because matlab cannot calculate units, so you need to make sure that appropriate unit handling is done in the specification and execution of the code.
My next question would be on this section.  It appears to be the section where I specify particle size.  I can see a variable "radius" (which I know now is in units of wavelength), but I'm not sure what the two commented out "radius" variables are for.  My understanding was the impetus behind designing a lot of these tools was to simulate non-spherical particles (such as my graphite), and I'm not really sure how to do that here.
    
    % radiuz=nmax2ka([1:20]);
    %
    % try; clear timetakes; end
    %
    % for ii=1:length(radiuz)
    %     tic
    %
    tic
    radius = 2.5;
    %radius = radiuz(ii);
    %radius = 1;
    Nmax = ka2nmax(k*radius);

Beyond that I'm confused about this:
    
    diam_microns = radius * 1.064 * 2 / n_medium;
    %
    %     if Nmax < 12
    %         Nmax = 12;
    %     end
    
What is the 1.064 in there for?
This has been an absolutely serious proposal for a while, but it's now excluded because considering what we know about the intergalactic medium it's dense enough for the annihilation on the boundary to be visibile, and we don't see it.
> ... I don't think we could tell apart a antimatter star or planet from the same made of normal matter.

Probably not, but if there are regions dominated by matter, and regions dominated by anti-matter,  then there should be some pretty intense ultraviolet light coming from the boundary between the regions, and, as far as I'm aware, that hasn't been observed.


We think there are no antimatter galaxies because even the interstellar vacuum is not entirely empty. Particles emitted by the stars in a galaxy form a sort of 'galactic wind', similar to the interstellar wind. Both matter and antimatter galaxies should emit galactic winds, but the wind emitted by a matter galaxy is predominately made up of matter (and photons but they will be irrelevant for the rest of my argument), whereas an anti-matter galaxy emits an anti-matter wind. This means that at the point where these two winds meet, there should be characteristic emission from matter-antimatter anihilation reactions, but we don't see that. 
What if when right after the big bang there was a density fluctuation so that now all the antimatter is just outside of the observable region?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryogenesis

> In physical cosmology, baryogenesis is the generic term for the hypothetical physical processes that produced an asymmetry (imbalance) between baryons and antibaryons produced in the very early universe. The baryonic matter that remains today, following the baryonic-antibaryonic matter annihilation, makes up the universe.

https://home.cern/topics/antimatter/matter-antimatter-asymmetry-problem

> Consider a coin spinning on a table. It can land on its heads or its tails, but it cannot be defined as "heads" or "tails" until it stops spinning and falls to one side. A coin has a 50-50 chance of landing on its head or its tail, so if enough coins are spun in exactly the same way, half should land on heads and the other half on tails. In the same way, half of the oscillating particles in the early universe should have decayed as matter and the other half as antimatter.

> However, if a special kind of marble rolled across a table of spinning coins and caused every coin it hit to land on its head, it would disrupt the whole system. There would be more heads than tails. In the same way, some unknown mechanism could have interfered with the oscillating particles to cause a slight majority of them to decay as matter. Physicists may find hints as to what this process might be by studying the subtle differences in the behaviour of matter and antimatter particles created in high-energy proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Studying this imbalance could help scientists paint a clearer picture of why our universe is matter-filled.
Theorists with/doing PhDs (especially particle, astroparticle & cosmology), what kind of questions did you get asked in your PhD interviews? I have mine coming up soon and am looking into how to best prepare; I realise they'll ask me about my interests and undergraduate research, but more wondering what kind of physicsy questions they ask, and if I'm gonna be solving problems on the spot etc (only applying to UK universities).
What makes you passionate about your field of research? Or put another way, why should a grad student go into your field?
Can you sort in order of importance this list for an international student that is interested in doing a PhD in physics in the US?

* Physics GRE score
* General GRE Verbal score
* General GRE Quantitative score
* General GRE Writing score
* TOEFL score
* Letters of recommendation
* Statement of Purpose
* Undergraduate grades
* Research experience

Also what's better between:

* Good letter from a not-so-famous professor
* Decent letter from a more famous professor

Basically my situation is this: I can take a good PGRE and TOEFL score, a bad Verbal, average Writing and good Quantitative GRE score but I have no research experience but I'm taking a master degree (not sure if this is the correct word. Basically here in Italy you take your first "basic" degree after 3 years and you can take a "master" degree in two more years).

The biggest problem for me is with the letters. There aren't many theoretical physicist professors in my university and another guy already asked them for a letter. I've spoke with them and they said that if they write a letter for me too they'll have to write a worse letter than him, since he's more "known" among professors. This basically means that if me and this other dude get the same scores and everything they'll probably chose him instead of me.

Thanks.
I'm a freshman physics/mathematics double major, though physics is definitely my main interest. My university has an extremely good math department, and I'll have the opportunity to take graduate-level courses if I wish in future years.

I'm really interested in particle physics, probably theory. What two or three math fields would be most helpful to pursue in hope of a future career in theoretical particle physics?

For reference, [here is the list](http://imgur.com/a/2l5Y2) of mathematics courses offered by my university.
I'm a junior physics/math double major currently having an identity crisis. Applying for scholarships has really made me question if grad school is something i want to pursue. I have great grades (~3.9 gpa) and astronomy research experience but I have yet to have a moment where i know i need to go to grad school to learn more about *insert something here*. I'm interested in most of my physics courses and enjoy math/programming, but I don't want to default into doing a PhD because of the huge time commitment. I dont think i can commit 6+ years of my life unless im fully invested. I know still have time to figure all of this out, but frankly not knowing what i will be doing after i graduate undergrad or even grad school is stressing me out. any life advice?
Next semester I'll be entering my final term of undergrad and will be taking stat mech, general relativity, particle physics, quantum mechanics 2 and doing  my thesis (which is really just me learning string theory via zwiebachs book).

So for the first time since I can remember I won't be taking a math course, which kinda bums me out. So my question is do you guys think it would be worth it to add on a topology course on top of all this? It sounds like a cool course and given that I want to do theoretical physics I feel it would be a relevant course to take, I'm just worried it will be a lot on my plate.
How do you know you should major in physics? Physics classes are tough. I love physics, I really do. At night, I fall asleep listening to lectures by Feynman, Susskind, Sean Carrol, and physics podcasts. I have enjoyed the physics classes I've taken/am taking so far (classical mechanics/electricity and magnetism). But the classes are a real struggle for me. Each lecture, I feel very confused with all of these equations and laws thrown at me. I read the book, do practice problems (which I have to force myself to do, although sometimes I enjoy it). I never feel I completely understand anything, I'm lucky if I understand half of what all of this stuff truly means. The tests/quiz questions often involve things I've never seen in the homework or read in books, which is a different feeling than in any other class I've taken. I'm a community college student about to transfer next year, and I send my UC applications in October. I received an A in mechanics (which disappointingly, I didn't like), and got a 50% on my first E&M test (which I really, really like). To all of you physicists/physics students, is this lifelong confusion just something you get used to? Or does a true physicist feel like these classes are a breeze. Is physics just taught in a different way? Has my brain reached its limit of understanding? I feel like I am being pushed past the limit of my knowledge. Please guys, just give me your honest feedback. Thanks.
How hard is studying really? And how hard is the job after?

Did anyone with chronic pain manage to get through studies/to keep working in the physics field?

I am asking because I have stress related Chronic pain and I can't deal with the apparent amount of effort required to get through uni and get a degree in physics, so I doubt that worklife will be any easier. 

[I posted my question also here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/559jsk/how_hard_is_studying_physics_at_university_really/?st=itq5hhcl&sh=1efa5588)

Edit: PS I do LOVE physics
Will I ever be good enough for research? In my second year physics course "research skills", we are supposed to read Millikan's original paper on determining h using the photoelectric effect and comment on it. I'd be lying if I said I understood a single thing out of that paper. Either I am not good enough physics research, or our prof is making us do something way above our current level. It feels ridiculous that I am able to do all the actual math and physics in my other courses, and yet reading this thing is impossible. Anyone have any insight?
Which field has more opportunities for future discovery, Astrophysics or Quantum Physics?
Math.
Computer science/cognitive science major here. AI is less about using CS to understand the brain and more about using the brain and other natural processes as inspiration for creating effective statistical models.
What you're looking for is probably a double major, one in biology/biochem with a neuro specialization (if offered at your school) and the second major in either computer science or statistics/math.

Unless you're interested in AI for AI's sake, like me, then compsci/cogsci is the way to go. Also a lot of schools offer 4-5 year masters programs for undergrads in certain fields; might be worth looking into.
Depending on what you're interested in specifically, a physics degree could be more than just indirectly relevant. There's a reason the cost function you minimize in learning is referred to as an energy landscape. 

Some advice I've consistently heard given by profs and grad students over at the cog sci department to starry eyed undergrads is to get as much statistics and math under their belts as soon as possible. 

Look at who's working at your institution. Who do you like? 

There are lots of physics people who work/worked in computational neuroscience. A few off the top of my head would be John Hopfield, Terry Sejnowski, Larry Abbott, Henry Abarbanel, Sebastian Seung, Tatyana Sharpee, David Kleinfeld, Haim Sompolinski, Christof Koch, Alan Litke, Danielle Bassett... 

"Cognitive science" might be what you're looking for. Physics probably isn't the most relevant degree if that's your main interest.
This intuition is based on the [old quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_quantum_theory#Hydrogen_atom), particularly the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule.  

As a technical point, though, this kind of quantization rule only works for systems that satisfy a certain condition, which we call 'integrability.' Non-integrable systems (like the Helium atom) don't obey this rule in the same way (although this has no effect on Dirac's argument).

I think the author may be a bit confused about the history here though (or maybe I am!). Some people have made this kind of angular momentum quantization argument, but that wasn't Dirac's original argument. His argument basically introduced 2 different ways to represent the wavefunction of an electron near a magnetic monopole, and there's a region in the problem where both representations should be valid. But in order for the 2 wavefunctions to agree with each other in that region, he needed a quantization condition for the product of the electric and magnetic charges. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Dirac.27s_quantization

From the references in the above article:
Paul Dirac, "Quantised Singularities in the Electromagnetic Field". Proc. Roy. Soc. (London) A 133, 60 (1931)

This link is from the above references but doesn't work for me:
http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/133/821/60
In the presence of a spherical potential the orbital angular momentum is quantized. This falls directly out of the math (Legendre polynomials). The boundary conditions are periodic because of the wave nature of the electron and the reasonable demand that the wavefunction must be square Integrable .All the quantum numbers are derived directly from the boundary conditions and the math. Remember the orbitals describe time independent (stationary states). 

Dirac's equation describes a free electron in the absence of a potential where the time and space components are symmetrical so it doen't  apply here (Schoedinger's eq. Is first order in time and 2nd order in space). . Also, periodic boundary conditions apply to all atomic/molecular stationary states including He orbitals, so I am not sure what the previous comment was alluding to. Sometimes physicists don'the know squat about real atoms and molecules.
Randomness means that when studying some system, the best possible prediction we can make, using all the information about the system that exist, will be a probability distribution, not a fixed single outcome. It's important here that I write "all the information that exist", since it implies that we get a probability distribution  simply because that's how the world works and not because that there's something we don't know. That's how we know it's random, I guess. Then it sort of becomes a question about what probability means, to which there are different schools of thought, like frequentist or Bayesian to name two common ones.

Note that the whole question somehow depends on your interpretation of QM. Whether or not my explanation above makes sense depends on what you believe about how QM works. In particular it only makes sense if what we can know about the system is the same as all information that exists about it; i.e. if there is no information that we can't learn, or in other words no hidden variables. There are interpretations that say that such hidden information does exist (i.e. Bohmian mechanics), and then there is no randomness; we just can't predict perfectly because we don't know everything. However, because of Bell inequalities you instead have to have non-locality, which to most physicists seems like a really bad idea. 


Another way my explanation can fail is if you believe that there is more than one outcome; i.e. what if every possible outcome actually happens? This is the story of the many-world interpretation, where again there is no randomness, but now not because of hidden information but because the "branching" of the universe. 
Randomness arises in experimental observations.  Experiments in the quantum domain are observed to have random outcome.  The explanatory structure of the theory of quantum mechanics does not provide a means to refine the experiment to remove the randomness.  Repeating an experiment a large number of time will demonstrate a distributional structure to the randomness but there is no path given in the theoretical explanation to further reduce the experiment to arrive at a deterministic outcome for a single experiment.  
>They would therefore present a similar observational signature to that of massive compact halo objects, or MACHOS, which were suggested as a dark matter candidate in the 1980s and ruled out by observational searches

Interesting to hear. I've heard talk of MACHOS getting a second look after the gravitational wave detection. Looks like a red herring.
I don't have enough knowledge to answer your question, but my experience with Kerbal Space Program suggests that anything that enters deep enough within the atmosphere (I would estimate some 100 km above ground) is not going to come out again.
The momentum of such an object is so huge that there is very little change in velocity for an object passing through the atmosphere. This is true for objects roughly a km or so in diameter.  The surface area to volume ratio of the object is insufficient for the atmosphere, which is 1000 less dense to change the objects momentum (velocity). However, it would be very bright and many tens of thousands of degrees, and thus flash fry anything within line of sight. These temperatures are high enough to disassociate the molecular components of the atmosphere and result in toxic amounts of nitrous oxide. Even for "small" objects the fluence is many times higher than that of the sun and burns stuff over broad areas. The recent Russian meteorite (apartment building size) caused second degree burns and was brighter than the sun for 80 km or so. For a huge object I am not sure how much thermal and kinetic energy would be transferred to the atmosphere but in any event it would probably be catastrophic over a continent sized area.
It is possible - the bigger the asteroid, the lower it can go. The atmosphere doesn't have a fixed end anyway, all the satellites in low Earth orbit are flying through the very thin outer layers of our atmosphere, and can do so for years.

Not really windy, more shockwave-y, as the asteroid would go through the atmosphere with a speed of at least 11 km/s (typically with tens of km/s). There is nothing to ignite. Some of the front of the asteroid would evaporate. If the asteroid goes low enough, people living near its path will be very unhappy, with the results depending on the size and lowest point of the asteroid.
Thank you so much for the replies everyone, they were quite informative.
here are the variables you need to look at to solve your question.
1. size doesn't matter it all about density and mass.
2. the law of attraction says that if two bodies are in a vacuum and they have enough mass to attract each other. they will collide over time.

Answer: so let's say this asteroid gets bumped and starts its trip toward earth. passes into the sphere of influence of earth. if we are lucky the moon will take the hit and pull the asteroid away from us, but if the asteroid is too fast the moon will just change its course
slightly. Now to the Sad part. Mathematically once an object that sizes let's say the size of Aisa for example. comes at us there's no dodging it. it would hit the earth most likely in the pacific ocean the asteroid would enter the atmosphere and generate so much air friction it would vaporise water and the Ozone. the force of the impact would send the tectonic plates into a free for all and tsunamis would cover almost of the land mass. the end of all mankind and life on earth. nuclear winter for a few decades. volcanic activity all over the globe.

Spirals in galaxies aren't static features, but [density waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy#Density_wave_model). 
The simplest explanation is to assert that the orbital velocity of a star in a galaxy declines as a function of its distance from the center of mass. Given that simple rule (more formally expressed mathematically, of course), imagine a configuration of stars that initially looks like this:

                                               +
                                               +
                                               +
                                               +
                                               +
                                               +
                                               +
                             +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                                               +
                                               +
                                               +
                                               +
                                               +
                                               +
                                               +

Now imagine something that I won't try to draw -- consistent with the rules of orbital mechanics the system's member stars commence orbiting the center of mass. The stars nearer the center have higher orbital velocities than the stars farther away. This differential rotation creates a spiral. Very simple and intuitive.

If instead of some straight lines as in this diagram, you have some random clumps of matter and the same orbital mechanics, over time you also get a spiral, due to differential velocities.

As it turns out, in real galaxies, not mathematical models, the stars distant from the center orbit faster than they ought to based on the amount of visible matter, which has led to the theory of Dark Matter, matter that doesn't absorb or emit light but that interacts gravitationally with the matter around it.
I'm guessing that styrofoam shielding is more cost effective. You can't go outside on Mars anyway.
It's feasible for a small spacecraft as [discussed in this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576514003798).  However, some of their results are dependent on being in vacuum.  But it would be a lot easier to build a giant superconducting coil on the ground if necessary for a Martian base.

It's also possible to construct a planet-wide set of coils running latitudinally.  I can't find it, but there's a paper discussing the necessary current and size of the coils, and it ends up being something like a set of ten coils wrapping around the entire Earth at different latitudes, each a meter in diameter.

Edit: I found the paper!  http://www.nifs.ac.jp/report/NIFS-886.pdf
While possible, it would be cheaper and easier in the long run just to build a habitat covered by a few meters of soil and rock. This would allow the electrical power that would have been used on such a shield to be put to other, more productive uses.
Mars already has small localized magnetic fields. May be better to find one of these. 
Id like to see the math but I've been out of school way too long for it.  I see some posts about localize magnetic fields. One point I want to make is that the earths field isn't super strong but it is big, so when the field is around the planet incoming cosmic rays don't need to be deflected that much when it happens 50-100 miles away.  However is the field is only around the colony and say just 100's of feet away it would need a bigger deflection to be effective.
Well, remember that magnetic fields dissipate as 1/r^2. If you want to maintain a magnetic shield big enough to cover a settlement, that is a LOT of magnetic field. You could cover most of a dome with them, but that is a lot of superconducting material/a lot of liquid nitrogen/helium to keep it superconducting; that gets expensive real quick, even on the scale of a mars mission.

I'm too lazy to do the calculations of how strong a field you would need, but I'm betting it would be pretty strong :O
I'm ignorant. How do find the energy spectrum of radiation one would find on mars. Once I know what's there I'll tell you how to shield it.

Short answer is to dig a hole and live underground.

If they just spin the planet faster it will create a stronger magnetic field
Essentially, it's not really either the momentum or energy that needs to be taken into account, but both together. 

Take a baseball and bat, for instance. Without putting energy in, if you're bunting, the ball goes back towards the pitcher and the bat goes backwards. Now, without putting energy in, if you're hitting a ball from a tee, you basically drop the bat and neither the bat nor ball move. Now let's add energy to the system from the batter. He swings and hits. If he hits it from the tee, it goes only so far. If he hits a pitched ball, not only does the ball (a) go back from just hitting the bat (like the bunt), it also gets (b) energy from the batter equal to that being hit from the tee and (c) even more extra energy from the batter due to the deformation of the ball and bat allowing the same force to be applied over a longer time than hit from the tee.

While this analogy might not hold 100% for hockey puck and stick (in my imagination, the puck might overtake the stick and they both go backwards in the bunting case), I do believe the rest of it holds.

As for the specific argument, I can say that a one-timed puck will generally be faster than one hit from rest, assuming you hit both with the same strength. This isn't for the case when a puck is at speeds that your strength can't overcome. And as for the 100%, 40%, 75% thing, you'd need those actual numbers and actual equations, which I doubt you'll get here today.
While the true answer has endless complications at essence both shots are elastic collisions (mostly). For shots of equal strength the rebound will be faster if there's already energy going into it, so the one timer wins.

Don't try and add actual numbers to your answer though.

-physicist who's played five hockey games in the last 48 hrs
The answer is that you might be right or wrong, but your explanation
>You're redirecting that momentum so you don't need to add as much of your own power

is definitely insufficient to justify your claim.

For the purposes of this discussion, we can imagine the hockey puck as being just a circle moving in 2 dimensions. Let's set up our coordinate system so that we can easily refer to the two directions; one axis will be along the line connecting the point of the shot and the center of the goal (parallel axis), the other axis will be perpendicular to the first (perpendicular axis).

Recall that the orthogonal components of the momentum vector are independent. The momentum in the direction you want to shoot is totally unrelated to the momentum in the direction perpendicular to where you want to shoot. Each component is only affected by the force in that direction. So, if you want to take a stationary puck and accelerate it until it's momentum is P, that requires a total change in momentum of P (you end at P, you start at 0). However, if you want to redirect the momentum from purely perpendicular to purely parallel, what you have to do is apply a force that slows the puck in the perpendicular direction and speeds it up in the parallel one. If you calculate the total change in momentum from P in the purely perpendicular direction to P in the purely parallel, you'll find that it's magnitude is Sqrt(2) P; i.e. it's bigger than P. That means that for a given amount of time, t, it takes a BIGGER force to redirect the momentum of an object from perpendicular to parallel than it does to start an object from rest and get it going up to the same speed. 

On the other hand, if all you want to do is rotate the momentum a little bit from almost-parallel to purely parallel, then you can do a slightly more complicated calculation to show that takes LESS change in momentum than starting the puck from rest. You can maybe work out that the break-even point is a rotation of 60 degrees. So, your explanation doesn't really work, in general. Sometimes it's easier to redirect momentum with a given strength of force, sometimes it's harder.

However, you might still be right that it is easier to redirect the momentum of the puck than it is to start it from 0 (despite the fact that it requires either a larger force or more time for your stick to be in contact with the puck). It's just that you have to explain WHY it's easier; the fact that you're redirecting momentum, alone, isn't enough because our very basic picture says redirecting momentum takes more force or more time, rather than less sometimes (and in the video you linked, the shooter is changing the direction of the puck from almost purely perpendicular to almost purely parallel). 

At this point, things get really tricky and to find the right answer you have to do something much more detailed. There's really no good reason to assume that the shooter's force for a stationary slap-shot and a one-timer are the same. The bio-mechanics could be just very different because you're often in motion during a one-timer and often not for a slap-shot from rest, etc.  There's even less good reason to assume that the time the blade is in contact with the puck is the same. The problem is that there are many effects (redirecting momentum can be harder, a moving puck exerts more force on the stick causing it to bend more, a player increases the speed of his stick when he starts moving forward before the shot, etc.) and there's no principled way to say which one is the most important generally.

To get a handle on this you really need a plausible mathematical model and to do some real calculations. You could start with something very simple, like assuming that the player is always stationary, that both the puck and stick are 100% rigid objects and that the player always exerts a constant force on the stick. Then you make things more complicated from there. It'd be pretty easy to relax the assumptions that the player is stationary. Then you might keep the puck rigid, but model the stick as a linear elastic medium, etc. And hopefully what you'll be able to find are ranges of parameter values where a one-timer is faster/slower than a similar slap-shot from rest, and you can give a convincing argument about why that's happening.
From my own understanding you'd be correct. Some of the puck's kinetic energy would be transferred to the stick as potential, making it bend back a little more than it is already, then when the stick is lifted to the vertical position, it releases the potential and snaps forward. It would depend on the properties of the stick and puck, and the percentage of energy transferred, but with modern equipment I'm very sure that less input from the shooter redirecting a moving puck would be more powerful overall compared to a shot with more input from the shooter but on a stationary puck. 
It's like kicking a football (soccer ball) that's moving across your fov, you can feel that it gets more power when it's moving compared with being statonary.
tl;dr you're probably correct.
It depends on how bendy your stick is.

If you have a rigid stick, with absolutely no bend, then it is easier to hit a pass that is coming at you slowly. There is no such thing as "redirecting momentum". Momentum by definition has a set momentum, and you need to first hit it hard enough to stop that existing momentum, and add to the puck your own momentum from the stick.

Situation #2: You have a somewhat bendy hocked stick. Then, as the puck comes in, it bends the stick backwards, which quickly bends back forward to give the puck a little more flick as you slapshot it. Thus, with a slightly bendy hockey stick you will hit a fast incoming puck harder than a slow pass.
Unfortunately they didn't really 'settle' anything, because all of us here already believed that Nature violates the Bell inequalities (or the CHSH inequalities, whatever you prefer). And anyone on the other side cooking up some more and more convoluted theory as to why the inequalities appear to be violated while the universe is actually governed by some local hidden variables can just introduce some slightly more complicated thing to explain this result.  
> If you measure the rotation of one particle, you will instantly know the spin of its entangled particle. Physicists have considered this behavior as “spooky” as it doesn’t follow our daily logic at all.

Well, strictly speaking, if two spin-half particles were prepared in a net spin-zero state, and you measure the *projection* of one particle's spin along a given axis, you know the other particle's spin is opposite along that same axis. However, you can only predict probabilities for the partner's spin along any other axis.

And this by itself doesn't violate our common sense. In fact, it's just conservation of angular momentum. The net angular momentum along any axis must be zero. For an analogy, if you put a red ball and a green ball in two separate boxes, and moved them far apart, you'll know the color of the ball in the other box instantly when you open one box. There's nothing spooky or mysterious about this.

What makes the quantum mechanical scenario different is what happens when you measure the projection of spin along *different* axes for each entangled partner. There are strict bounds on how strongly "up" and "down" measurements along different axes can be correlated if you assume what's called local realism, which basically amounts to saying that the spin measurements reveal pre-existing properties whose values are fixed when the two particles are created. [This paper by J.S. Bell](https://hal.inria.fr/file/index/docid/220688/filename/ajp-jphyscol198142C202.pdf) gives a very clear explanation of local realism, with easy-to-follow reasoning and examples.

Quantum mechanics violates these bounds, and experiments confirm QM's predictions in these cases. This means that local realism is wrong. Perhaps that's "spooky" to some people, but I think that's a subjective judgment. A lot of people found Newton's force of gravity, which acted at a distance without a medium, to be occult and spooky in his time, but no-one I know today would bat an eye at the idea. And some ancient Greeks found the idea of irrational numbers viscerally unsettling, but their existence is something most people today shrug off without a care. I think people just need to get used to the non-locality in quantum mechanics.

> Quantum mechanics also states that properties of particles are only stable when the particle is perceived.

This isn't true. Perception is a psychological phenomenon that does not appear anywhere in the formulation or application of quantum mechanics.

check out the london uni event pages. Many events are public and free. And there're generally tons going on all the time. recomend Imperial UCL Kings 
Here's one: http://www.ukseds.org/rispace/
UCL run a public talk every Friday (during term time) at 6:30pm in Euston. Its aimed at 16-18 year olds but by no means restricted to just that age group (I've seen all sorts of people in there). The whole thing is free (and you even get free biscuits!) and the subjects can be anything in science, but they mainly focus on physics (because it is clearly the best science). More information (including lecture titles, dates, directions and even recordings of previous lectures) can be found at https://www.ucl.ac.uk/phys/department/science_centre I found it really useful while I was studying my A-Levels to go to an actual university and listen to experts talk about aspects that I hadn't even thought about. &nbsp;

Other than that I think the Royal Society have a few things on (they pretty much always do), but I'm not sure if you need to book or pay to get in.
I am not sure what your field is, but I always look here for conferences:

It is a fun way to expose a project and some of its details to a wider audience. And maybe you get some more varied input from those users.
I gonna give it a try.

It's a pity they don't have a Android version or Linux
Unfortunatelly (for the theorists here), the water bottle flipping trick relies on the motion of the water in the bottle, which takes up the angular momentum of the bottle. That means you need to solve Poisson's equations for a turbulent liquid in a free-falling container, something that is extremely difficult to do analytically.

If you want to do high-school level research on this, I would go the purely experimental route.
I think a bit of it is just keeping the center of mass over the base of the bottle, the water helps do this. In order to tip over then the center of mass just needs to be somewhere not above the flat base so filling it up too high would make it more likely to tip since the CoM is at a higher point so the tipping angle would be larger 

Edit so I'm on mobile so this is kind of hard but I'm sticking with that center of mass explanation. I don't think torque would really come into play if you just look at CM. The volume of water, the dimensions of the bottle and the landing angle would be what are important here. Also the density of the bottle and whatever liquid you put in would be needed for CM. 

If you wanted to use torque then you'd need to use the CM as a pivot point ( not too sure to be honest might use the part of the bottle touching the table). The. You'd need an integral to calculate the torque on both sides from the gravity working on the water and the plastic bottle. You'd also still need a landing angle since you'd need that to calculate the cross product for the torque 
I think there's not one equation for that, I don't think we can treat this like a simple high-school motion class, because the water inside the bottle has its own properties and inertia, it's one of those things that a small change in the swing of the bottle can mean it either gets balanced or doesn't.
But nice question tho, would like to see it answered!
*Binary* is simply an agreed upon set of rules for interpreting a sequence of *ON* and *OFF* states. These ON and OFF states can take any physical form. It can be series of [hole punches in cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era), a series of [magnetized states](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/how-hard-drive-works/), a series of [field effect transistors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7JLXs5es7I), or even a series of [minecraft blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB684ym3QY4). So, what your 0's and 1's are made of depends upon what kind of device you are using. 

A *digital* device is any device which stores and reads data that takes a binary form. So, a digital device does not store the letter 'A', it stores the binary sequence '01000001'. Even [mechanical computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_computer) which store data in binary form are considered to be digital devices, even though they have no electrical components. 

In short, the terms 'digital' and 'physical' are not opposite terms; since digital devices exist in the real world, they are of course also physical devices. 


What you are looking for is [Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory), have a look at Claude Shannon's stuff, get your head around Entropy and complexity.  Info is the arrangement and relationships of ..stuff, not the stuff itself, in the same way that a story is not made of ink, bits of info are not made of charge or voltage, but a complex arrangement of charges can contain info, as can a sheet of punched holes or a bath full of water molecules. 

I'd try the CompSci guys first, then start on how it all applies to thermodynamics.
This should be helpful!

This explains how data is stored, and it's physical properties. Hope it's of use to you ☺️
It isn't made of anything: it's a mathematical representation. As NobblyNobody said, read Shannon. He started it all! It's surprisingly accessible.
The medium or the message? Not the same thing.
I don't think binary/digital information should have any special significance; don't get hung up on binary or non-binary, that's just a convenient choice of basis for designing computers. 

The following feels a bit off-topic, but it's something a bit on my mind lately, so whatever. It's interesting to ask "is reality made up of information"? This is not a particularly new idea, there is the old slogan about "It from bit" and so on. And it sort of makes sense to me: all our physics theories are mathematical, and it's very hard for me to imagine physics ever moving away from mathematical models. So whatever the fundamental description of reality is, it'll probably be some mathematical structure. Then, if we believe that the fundamental theory is some mathematical structure or model, then what is the physical world we observe? It's nothing but a particular solution to this model; and me who is writing this is nothing but a tiny part of this solution, a mathematical substructure thinking about myself thinking about the mathematical structure. This is essentially Tegmarks mathematical universe hypothesis; and it naturally leads to pretty extreme multi-verse ideas and so on. Anyhow, if anyone read all this, then I'm sorry for the rambling mess.  
I have a copyright law example to further my question.

There was a case called "C.M. Paula Co. v. Logan". In this case, Logan purchased a greeting card with an image on it. Logan then used chemicals to remove this image and transfer it to a plaque. Logan then resold the plaque.

Logan was later sued by the greeting card company for infringement of their copyrighted image. C.M Paula Co. argued the plaque was an illegal reproduction. However, the court sided with Logan, noting that for every plaque logan made, Logan had to purchase a corresponding greeting card.

In this example:
1)the greeting card its the initial storage medium. 
2)The image is the information/intellectual property. 
3)The plaque is the new storage medium.

This seems analogous to an mp3 stored on a hard drive. Lets suppose that an mp3 can be transferred from one hard drive to a different hard drive bit by bit (meaning no copying exists/occurs) 

In this Example: 
1)The hard drive A is the initial storage medium.
2) The mp3 is the information/intellectual property. 
3)The different hard drive B is the new storage medium.

In this case, could someone reasonably argue that (similarly to the ink of the image transferred to the plaque) that the information representing an mp3 is physical (again, similar to the physicality of ink), and that hard drives are simply storage mediums?
I also posted this same post in /r/compsci and /r/quantum 

Lots of conversation if you're interested in seeing their thoughts too

> Is binary made up of atoms? 

This is more of a philosophical question than a question about physics. A series of binary bits can take many forms -- electromagnetic waves in space, magnetic domains on a recording medium, electron wells in a semiconductor device. But you appear to be asking about the concept of binary bits, not their physical embodiment, even though you're asking as though you want to pin down the latter.

A collection of binary bits can possess entropy, among other properties, and this can be specified and measured, but that fact has no connection with the physical representation of the bits. A bit-collection's information properties are independent of its physical representation. Therefore when you ask a question like this, you need to ask carefully, to avoid confusion about what's being asked.
At what level? 
Feynman Lectures are always good. As another user asked, what level? Is this algebra based? Calculus based? If calculus based, are you actually doing the calculus, or doing the formulas derived from the calculus (essentially asking intro vs. advanced E&M). 
What textbook are you using? When I took E&M last year we used Griffiths, and just reading it through is super helpful. I think there's a guy on youtube that works through the examples in Griffiths, but he doesn't add much value, he basically follows through the examples verbatim.
For a 200 level, [this little image](http://www.sengpielaudio.com/FormulaWheelElectronics.gif) should suffice for most of it.
Jackson Electrodynamics. If you make it through, you have definitely learned it....though you may suffer from PTSD.
> I am pleased to say that in the case of my Quantum book I have extracted myself from Pearson, switching to Cambridge University Press, and the identical book now sells for less than half what Pearson was charging.

Now he tells me...
During spring break of 2008, I went to visit my girlfriend at Reed College. Since I was a huge nerd, I brought along my copy of Griffiths' E&M textbook with the intention of having him sign it. I looked him up in the directory and found his office, knocked on the door, and there he was.

I stammered out some dumb joke about how his problem sets were too hard, and he very graciously accepted my request to sign the book. I would have loved to chat for a bit, but since I had obviously interrupted his work, I thought it best to just let him be. My career path eventually veered away from physics, but I'll always appreciate his willingness to humor a stupid junior from another school who was star-struck just to be in the same room as him.

(When classes started again, half my friends thought that my signed copy was awesome and the other half couldn't believe I had wasted my break on something this stupid.)
I only used his E+M book during my undergrad, and it's a fantastic book. Great interview.
> I could never write a book from scratch, without this incremental sequence of successive approximations.

oh boy i didn't know griffiths was a comedian too
I will leave my answers up to the interviewer to determine as an exercise..... 
I love his QM and E&M books. They're just fantastically designed and written.
I just wish someone like him or Taylor would write a good undergraduate stat mech book.  I did not enjoy Kittel.
His Introduction to Electrodynamics is superb.
I have his Introduction to Quantum Mechanics sitting here on my shelf at work.  It's such a easy text to read, made QM much more understandable for me.  


>What is your advice to a layperson who is interested in QM but lacks the math background to take on a serious undergraduate course?

>Learn the math.  You’ll be glad you did, whether you take the QM course or not.

People say this a lot on here but it's nice to see repeated by someone "credible." Perhaps people might believe it this time.  
Griffiths's book Revolutions in 20th Century Physics is also great.

I hope he writes another book on another topic.
His Intro to elementary particles is one of the best
I'm sorry, but I **hate** his books, especially his *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics*, with super passionate, fiery hatred for the chapters on spin and ladder operators.  It's completely symptomatic of his entire approach that these chapters have neither sufficient physical motivation nor mathematical rigor.  

His Electrodynamics is much better, even excellent, but I would prefer if colleges dumped him for Wagsness as the standard book for electrodynamics.  I understand why they keep his books, though, as he often has a hand in creating the physics GRE subject test and therefore has a stranglehold on physics education nationwide.  
I have a strong dislike for Griffiths and the rest of the textbook authors of his generation for dumbing down the american undergraduate curriculum. Over in Belgium and France in their 2nd year of university they do CM at the level of Goldstein/Landau and EM at the level of Jackson, QM at the level of Sakurai/Cohen-Tannoudji. What could possibly be the reason for such immense discrepancy?
Taylor is a truly astounding book; it's easy to read the first time through and rigorous enough for a complete undergraduate understanding.
his quantum book is gaabage. EM is good tho, taught myself undergrad EM1 and EM2 from it

As someone who doesn't know all that much about cars (and you can safely assume that's most of us), can you clarify? Are these shocks? are these attached to the hood as roll bar springs? Are there springs on the driveshaft to keep it from reacting too quickly? I mean... explain the purpose of these, what's their role in the car, what do they do, are the force ratings torsional or longitudinal (if it applies), are they under pressure when they're installed, what's the coil thickness and distance between coils (to see if it's deforemed), etc...

You picked the perfect place to ask a complex spring question (I assume /r/askphysics wouldn't), but just like you can't ask a diving question to a person in the desert, you can't ask a car question here without explaining all the accompanying variables.
Springs are pretty simple physical objects, they apply a force directly proportional to the displacement from natural length, in the opposite direction of the force applied. This can be represented by F = -k*x, where k is the "spring constant" that describes how stiff the spring is. In this case you have 2 springs of differing length, so the displacements will be intrinsically different. There will be exactly one point where the springs will exert the same force on the mounts, but other than that their performance will be different. 

I'm fairly certain the lbs rating for the springs are related to the spring constant, but the spring constant is in terms of Force per length, not just Force. I assume there's probably a standard displacement to measure a force response, in that case. 

I'm not certain exactly the configuration of the springs, so it's hard to say anything further. Are the springs already compressed when installed, to maintain a pressure against the mount? Are the mounts variable in length to account for different length springs?
Stainless steel is a pretty poor conductor compared to aluminium, and will not be as effective as a heat sink. Whether or not it is sufficiently good for the job in this case is not something that can be trivially answered without specs or testing.
> I was under the strong impression by my boss that metal [sic] will heat the led circuitery alot faster compare to aluminum and will affect the life lenght of the led strip.

When you say "metal" in the above sentence, do you mean stainless steel?

The answer to your question is that much depends on how the LEDs are mounted and what steps are taken to maximize the thermal conductivity between the LEDs and the metal bar.

But according to [this reference](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html) the thermal conductivity of aluminum is 205 W/m k, compared to stainless steel at 16 W/m k, both values at 25 ℃. So all things being equal, aluminum is a much better heat conductor and is preferred where heat dissipation is a factor.
Infrared spectroscopist here.

The Drude model is pretty much the foundation of everything we do in my field. Although the assumptions of his model are technically incorrect, the frequency-dependent form of metallic optical conductivity derived by Drude is correct and very widely used to model reflection and transmission experiments in the far infrared. Moreover, the concept of spectral weight, or Drude weight, is extremely powerful for analyzing spectroscopic measurements. 

So if you're into spectroscopy, yes learn the Drude model. 
Are you taking a course - learn both, who knows what will be on the exam.

Pedagogically, the purposes of learning these earlier theories is to guide your understanding about why the later 'more correct' ones were developed, and also because they are also often mathematically easier to work through. As to if its useful from your point of view to go through the mathematics is up to you really.
Even if it mainly regards solid state physics, it's also very important in the study of extreme weather conditions in desertic regions. [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6120QOlsfU)
Low energy spectroscopy makes great use of it still. It's how they model absorption on the lower end. Visible/UV requires band theory and more complicated models of how light is absorbed.

[
In 240 B.C., the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes made the first good measurement of the size of Earth. By noting the angles of shadows in two cities on the Summer Solstice, and by performing the right calculations using his knowledge of geometry and the distance between the cities, Eratosthenes was able to make a remarkably accurate calculation of the circumference of Earth.](http://www.windows2universe.org/citizen_science/myw/w2u_eratosthenes_calc_earth_size.html)

How do you get g exact enough for your location?
We don't understand enough yet about the structure and engineering of deep artificial neural networks to apply them to foundational-type theories in physics. When what you're interested in is a natural kind of heuristic or optimization problem (like playing GO or tuning experimental parameters), then it's very natural to use these kind of neural networks as a black box. What you really care about is making the end result be as good as possible, given a known and large collection of data.

When we're talking about "unsolved" problems in physics though, we're usually not talking about getting very accurate computations. Given a certain experimental setup with certain known parameter values, we basically always have a "dumb" way of doing calculations to "turn the crank" and get some kind of numerical answer if we want it. Problems in physics are actually "unsolved" for 2 reasons. Either, we lack a high-level understanding of the problem that explains why the system does what it does (despite the fact that we can calculate/predict for particular instances). Or, we haven't even figured out yet how to mathematically specify the problem appropriately.

And in these cases neural networks might still be useful because they can identify patterns in data and particular calculations that humans cant, but to convert that into a bona fide theory we need some better understanding of how neural networks do what they do. I think there are 2 points here: first, neural networks are good at finding close-to-optimal solutions but they're not necessarily optimal and second, we need to be able to describe precisely what features the various layers of a deep network are actually encoding. 

Neural networks are actually much older than many people realize, and there's already been some deep mathematical connections drawn between them and physics. The loss function landscape and long-time dynamics of deep neural networks are actually very similar to those of spin glasses. There are many rigorous results about spin glasses, their local and global minima, and their dynamics that are currently being investigated in the context of deep neural networks. Spin glasses give a pretty consistent picture of why it is that deep neural networks always seem to find a reasonably optimal solution (but perhaps cannot find a true globally optimal solution in finite time).
Convolution networks are designed for solving 2-D problems, like images, video, and Go.  It's not necessarily the best tool for all types of problems.

And you are right, neural networks are black boxes.  It's just a fancy curve fitting tool.  Nothing more.

I think the physicist/mathematician John von Neuman said it best:

"With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk."
NNs are nothing more than things that fit functions to data. They're just very powerful fitters. You don't feed them problems to solve, you feed them data points to fit.

And CNNs in particular are designed to fit image filters. So they're not really the right class to look at for this.

And just to comment on a few other points you made in comments:

People are not big neural networks (despite what is often claimed). They're people. At the very least a functional physicist has to be able not only to recognize patterns and guess predictable answers, but most importantly to be creative and design new solutions adapted to new unsolved problems. Neural networks deep or not (alongside the eternal debate over whether depth is actually necessary) just don't do that - they only learn how to react based on a dataset of similar situation. They're very good at picking up the things that matter by being trained on big datasets, but they cannot invent new things that matter.

Another thing: your idea of what string theory, or perhaps theoretical physics is or how it works is really weird. Apart from the fact that "untestability of string theory" doesn't make any sense, theoretical physics is not like a big box full of physicists at their chairs being fed "theories" and being whipped into outputting "predictions". The physicists (which may or may not be whipped) continuosly *add* new ideas, a few of them theories, most of them techniques, insights, novel calculations. *Repeating* known calculations on different models mutatis mutandis is kind of the most easy part, and still NNs as we define them today would have a very hard time trying to do *that*.

I don't exclude AI might be able one day (maybe soon) to do the job of physicist. But I profoundly doubt you can do it with a NN.
There are some people working on automated theorem proving with deep learning, like [this guy](https://twitter.com/fchollet). This is the closest thing I can think of.


From an experimental perspective, NNs are used all the time to define Signal Regions, or areas that might be particularly sensitive to new physics. There is a paper somewhere that claims deep neural networks are better at feature identification than theoreticians, but I'm not sure if it's been replicated yet. 

In an EFT framework, NNs can help improve limits on broad classes of new physics. 

From a purely theoretical perspective, I don't think it makes much sense to ask a computer to formulate an original theory. You would have to program in some sort of immense knowledge of current research in mathematics as well as encode all of the experimental data, in a completely theory-agnostic way. I don't think it makes sense. 

Saying that, my honest opinion is that CERN is a few years behind the times in CompSci right now and I expect very good growth in this area from within and without. 
One of the challenges in simulating complicated quantum systems with large numbers of particles is that because of entanglement it requires a vast amount of information to fully represent the quantum states of such systems.  However, one of the miracles of physics is that despite this vast capacity for information, we are often able to have tricks or methods to compress it into some form that we can understand as classical beings - even though we don't think such compression is possible in general, were always on the lookout for cases where we can get lucky.  Anyway, I have seen a few discussions of this idea of using deep learning to store information about large quantum states.  It sounds promising to me, but usually in physics we like to be able to calculate or even prove things, and so the lack of a better analytical understanding of neural networks means that these simulations are only heuristic for now and not leading to new fundamental descriptions of quantum states yet.
I agree, this is a very interesting field, and a time in the field that's likely to see a lot of growth in the near future.

To your question, the simple answer is: yes.

The less simple answer is: Not at the moment.  We simply don't have computers capable of modeling the Standard Model, Quantum Mechanics, or Special Relativity acurately and in real time.  This means that any AI using the model we loaded, would be hindered, and may make incorrect observations due to faulty modeling.

In the two scenarios you cited, the AI won out because it was interacting with the real world; a go player in one instance, and the lasers in the second.  The real world is a much more accurate model of the real world than any simulation we load into the machine could be.

If you take this a step further and ask why not just give the AI access to the real world, we get closer to a yes answer, but the AI would still be limited to the inputs and tools we provide it, meaning it may need something for the solution that it doesn't know exists.

I believe in a few years, especially if quantum computers come to fruition and give us a means of accurately modeling the quantum world in a computer system, that AI will be an integral part of problem solving.

I always wonder what Physics (and science in general) would be like as a career if PhDs were unionized and paid something like what US Postdocs are paid now and Postdocs were abolished.

It would get rid of the meat grinder of a bajillion students/postdocs per professor (over a career) as getting students would require careful consideration, as they cost so much; pursuing a graduate career would not be so financially stifling/risky; the average student hired would be of a higher quality (and necessarily less of them), etc.  

As it stands now, grad school comes with a very high financial opportunity cost, and there is a good chance you'll end up with a job that you could have had right after your undergrad regardless.
What we need is unionization to get more stable positions opened so we aren't so precariously employed anymore. 

This will be exceedingly difficult to organize as it would require international involvement. 
Anyone else that uses the Nature Journals App for iPhone notice that right around the time this article was posted they no longer had any open access articles?

Leonard Susskind in his book 'the Black Holes War' claims that in RHIC (Relativistic Heay Ion Collider) experiment there should appear something that behaves similarily to a black hole in string theory (with gluon strings instead of fundamental strings iirc) and that should be additional support for his solution to the information paradox. That was in 2008. Did that actually happen in the way he predicted? If not, do other physicists expect it to happen in the future?

If so, then does the inability of the singularity to evolve into a different state mean that all contained quarks are in the lowest possible energy state?
I have some questions about the Landauer-Bennett resolution to Maxwell's Demon. 

Consider the simplified version of the demon with a single particle in a [Szilard engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory#/media/File:NAtomVacuumPumpMemory.png), which is just a box whose walls are at a fixed temperature T. In addition, we can insert a partition in the box, and the walls are pistons which can be moved in and out. There are some subtleties with working with a single particle in the engine, but if you imagine everything is time-averaged over long times then treating it like a gas makes sense (according to Feynman, but I'm suspicious...).

We first partition the box in half, so the particle is either on the left or right (call these two states 0 and 1). We now "measure" which side of the box the particle is on, which Bennett claims can be done with zero cost in energy and entropy. We can do this by coupling it to our demon, a reference Szilard engine with a partition and a single particle initially on the left (in state 0). The measurement process will either keep the demon in 0 or adiabatically move the demon to 1 depending on the result of the measurement. Crucially, according to Bennett, we can only do this measurement reversibly if the demon is in a known reference state (which I choose to be 0). Bennett's arguments here are convincing to me, and he gives some nice physical examples for enacting the above.

Here's where things get hairy for me. At this point, the demon uses the result of this measurement to extract work from the particle, which can be done by inserting a piston in the empty half of the engine, removing the partition, and letting the particle push the piston isothermally. Now, the only difference between this end state and the beginning state is the demon: we started with the demon in 0, and now the demon may either be in 0 or 1 depending on the result of the measurement. Now we need to reset the demon to 0 to complete the cycle, and the claim is that this resetting (erasure of information) requires you to dump heat back into the reservoir while doing the necessary work to compress the demon back to 0.

So my basic confusion here is why we can use our knowledge of the measurement to extract work from the first engine, but we cannot also use that knowledge to know whether we need to reset the demon bit back to 0 or not. If we know for sure what state the demon is in, we can always switch it without increasing entropy, and since this information was just used to extract work this information seems to be known.

Reading about this, it appears that the assumption involves the demon doing the measurement and the work without our knowledge of the measurement result. So you feed the demon in state 0 into a machine, and it comes out in an uncertain state, so I can't feed it back into the machine without doing some work. (In fact there is a Nature Letter from 2012 that cites Landauer and Bennett where experimentalists show that resetting such a random bit results in the correct entropy increase). But then if the demon is so smart it can move pistons and partitions based on the result of its measurement, why can't it reset itself based on the measurement?

Part of my frustration is that Bennett gives really nice physical examples of a demon that can do measurements adiabatically, but doesn't explain how to use that measurement to do work.
am i crazy, not seeing something correctly, or is there a flaw in the classical entanglement experiment?

entanglement validation experiment appears to make a fundamental flaw in regards to 1) measurement technique; 2) conservation of energy.

The experiment creates to particles with equal and opposite spins, they can then be both sent in two differing directions over small or large distances and then using a "spin detector" they measure the spin of a particle in alignment with the detector. Coincidentally, the corresponding particle of the pair when detected with a similarly aligned detector will have the appropriate opposite spin. This experiment is supposed to "prove" quantum entanglement, but it appears it does not since 2) appears to be completely overlooked as a reason for the supposed "entanglement".

Why is this so? the measurement technique appears selective ONLY for those of a certain spin direction, therefore only those of a spin in alignment with the device will be "seen". one would have to create a particle pair in plank-time scale in order to guarantee a single pair is actually created and have the detector "modify" that pair's spin. It is therefore more likely that only a pair of matching alignment to the detector are actually detected, since the creation event would last magnitudes longer than the plank-time scale, thus multitudes of particles would be created, and therefore the likelihood that at least one of those pairs is in alignment with the detector approaches 100% the further from the plank time-scale you get.

Additionally, the conservation of energy ensures regardless of the initial spin, both particles are already in opposite spin directions (this is non-violable). These spins are of course unknown until measured. If one is measured that only tells you what the spin of the other should be due to this conservation, it does not confer entanglement, just that the law of conservation of energy was upheld.

By the above, the experiment does not appear to confer entanglement at all, it only appears to be a spin-pair confirmation event. Due to time-scale constraints, the guarantee of 1 spin-pair is near impossible and therefore the measurements only find a matching pair due to conservation of energy and therefore do not confer entanglement to exist.

Am i missing something? what am i getting wrong?
Can you convert 1 A/m to mGauss?  My work seems to assume you can... According to them, 1A/m = 12.57mGuass
Hey everyone, I still don't get this : if we send a probe at 0.99c  to Alpha Centauri, it will take 4 years in earth time to get there right ? So it will send us a signal that we will receive in 8 years right ? But on the other hand, I understand that the time is dilated and that a lot more time will pass in the reference frame of the probe... So how can we receive the signal 8 years later if the probe saw a lot more time pass ?
In my thermodynamics book, it states that acc to First Law, U is a state function whereas q and w are path functions. Why?

Landau and Lifshitz's is an awesome book, but very dense, I didn't find it that useful when I was first learning the subject, but found it really illuminating on a second reading. One of my favourite references that is high-quality but has the advantage of being free to download is [David Tong's lecture notes](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/dynamics.htm).

Hey, we get this question a lot.  Here's a search of some posts on the topic.  Let me know if you need more.  Good luck.

I remember enjoying [this](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/) page by Nobel physicist G. 't Hooft when I was younger. It is a list of self-study resources for anyone interested in becoming a physicist by themselves. 
I have gotten a lot of valuable information from sixty symbols on youtube. They don't go into the maths a lot, but they explain a lot of topics pretty well, enough to know what people are talking about in this sub at least
reread all your lower and high school books, then move to thomas' calculus and some linear algebra book (perhaps poole, it can also be found online).

you need to climb the mountain first to get to the GR, you are still at the bottom.
read all your high school textbooks. Then go get a degree in physics. you will not understand GR at 14. 
What you're referring to is the Pauli Exclusion principle, which prevents multiple Fermions from occupying the same quantum state.

This principle is the cause of various kinds of "degeneracy pressure", each of which is overcome as a star collapses. See this article for a reasonable writeup: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter#Degenerate_gases

However, this is a case where the effects of general relativity and quantum mechanics are both expected to be strong, and hence where the incompatibilities between the two theories are problematic. Since we currently lack a working theory of "quantum gravity" to reconcile the two, nobody really can say for sure what happens at the center of a black hole. Saying that a singularity forms is in some ways shorthand for saying that the theories have broken down.
I'm not aware of any example of 'making a singularity from Fermions.' You might be asking about the singularities found inside a black hole, but according to GR such a singularity is a place there the spacetime curvature blows up. Black hole singularities aren't made of Fermions or Bosons. 
>Today, I read that what distinguishes fermionic and bosonic fields is mostly that the value at any given point can't be any number... 

That's not quite right. I mean, there is a correct intuition in there: it is true that a fermionic state can only be occupied or unoccupied (or a superposition of the two, of course). But that does not mean that a fermionic *field* must be a number between zero and one. The way this property, called the Pauli exclusion principle, is realized at the level of the field can be seen in the commutation relations.

A bosonic field ϕ(**x**,t) is generally required to *commute* for equal times:

ϕ(**x**,0)ϕ(**y**,0) - ϕ(**y**,0)ϕ(**x**,0) = δ(**x**-**y**)

whereas a fermionic field ψ(**x**,t) is required to *anticommute* for equal times:

ψ(**x**,0)ψ(**y**,0) + ψ(**y**,0)ψ(**x**,0) = δ(**x**-**y**)

The object on the right is a delta function. If you don't know what that is, just know that it is an object that is zero whenever its argument is nonzero, that is, whenever **x** and **y** are different. 

You should notice that bosonic fields behave somewhat like ordinary numbers that satisfy ab=ba, while fermionic fields are stranger, and look like they satisfy ab=-ba. That strange condition, it turns out, is enough to give Pauli's exclusion principle.

But in truth the notion of field "values" should be interpreted with care. Even a bosonic field is not a number. It is an operator valued distribution. Notice that when **x**=**y**, the field does not satisfy the "numberness condition" ab=ba.

In certain contexts it may be appropriate to pretend that the field is almost classical, and therefore a number, but fermion fields are never really almost classical just like someone can't be just a little pregnant: the condition ab=-ba is always very noticeable.

The gist of all this is that your question, as stated, is not very well posed because it relies on classical intuitions that fail in the regime you're interested in.

If you're asking about gravitational singularities, then there's a simpler answer: there are *no* particles in an idealized black hole, whether bosonic or fermionic. None. It is what is called a vacuum solution of general relativity. There is no mass and no energy anywhere. The singularity is not part of the spacetime, really. It's a point that's missing, just like the origin is missing from the domain of the function 1/x. 

Physically this is probably not true, but understanding it would require a theory of quantum gravity, which at present we don't have.
Come on Nature, give us something!
The drama surrounding the search for DM makes for awfully good theater. My impatience swells to its full expression when I see we have to wait until 2020 to see heroes or goats.

How do you create something to detect something you know almost nothing about?

First, lepton *flavor* is already known to be violated (see recent nobel prize). As for lepton number, there are many experiments looking for this under the awkward title, "neutrinoless double beta decay" and it is generally thought to be a rather plausible possibility (I think that most neutrino theorists think (hope, yearn, etc.) that neutrinos are Majorana - although there is no experimental evidence for this yet (nor would there be at current sensitivities)).

Under the assumption presented, then essentially yes.

That said, your question is at the heart of the recent discussion of the information paradox. We don't want to admit non-unitarity, but getting around it requires a big effort.
Yes. Black holes violate the conservation laws associated to the global symmetries of the standard model, like Baryon number, lepton number, etc...

You can drop baryons or leptons into a black hole and it will forget about them, and after its evaporation you'd be left with a different lepton/baryon/whatever number than before.

Black holes instead preserve quantum numbers associated with the symmetries of the background spacetime (so energy, linear momentum and angular momentum) and gauge symmetries (like electric charge, magnetic charge, weak isospin...). Depending on which theory you're considering, a black hole can have multiple "charges" under the various gauge interactions.
The theorem stating that black holes are "fully specified" by those properties does have limitations. For example, it doesn't say anything about what you'd see if you jumped in. (All obviously speculative, but reasonable people believe that a guy falling through the event horizon, feet inside already, head soon to go in, will soon happily find that his feet "will have have been" on the inside.

IIRC it's also a steady-state thing, and perhaps of only limited applicability to "real-world" black holes. Happy to be corrected here though.
I don't actually know but I have 2 probable answers:
1-black holes are mysterious and there are massive paradoxes around them that need to be solved.
2-It takes an infinite amount of time for any matter to fall into a black hole.  Things move, from an outside perspective, exponentially slower as they approach the event horizon due to the effect gravity has on time.  therefore, everything that could have fallen in stays stuck on the edge of a black hole.  (this would, I would think, mean that a black hole never truly forms, from an external reference frame, and so this problem will never occur).  

However, these are just my answers based off a Susskind lecture and a paper on dark stars, I hope an actual physicist will help
Answering your first question: what do you know so far? GR rests on pretty much the whole of classical physics: you should know classical mechanics including the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, and electromagnetism: the full version with the whole of Maxwell's equations. Quantum mechanics is not really necessary but it doesn't hurt.

The math is first what comes with all the physics prereqs: single and multi variable calculus, linear algebra, differential equations. You'll also need differential geometry, which is typically explained in most GR books.
If you have a have a math background up to ODEs and PDEs, this book is great. https://www.amazon.com/Most-Incomprehensible-Thing-Introduction-Mathematics/dp/0957389450/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1475030510&sr=1-1&keywords=a+most+incomprehensible+thing

If you don't have the math, you're not gonna learn much beyond what you'd see in a popular science book. If you have some math, though, check out the 3 books by David Griffiths (there's currently a post on /r/physics about an interview with him). He's probably my favorite textbook author. His newest edition E&M and Quantum books got published by Pearson, and they're only like $10 on Amazon...

Introduction to Electrodynamics, 4th ed

Introduction to Elementary Particles, 2nd ed

Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, 2nd ed



Every physicist learns E&M and QM. But most don't learn nuclear physics.

If you're interested in physics, you should go to college and major in physics. You can start to specialize once you start to learn things at a deeper level.
What background do you have to build upon in terms of maths and physics? Griffith's electrodynamics is a really brilliant book and there are pdfs on google. If you're confident in your maths Shankar's Principles of Quantum Mechanics is another brilliant book, with a complete mathematical prelude in the first chapter that contains everything you need to get a really good grasp of QM assuming you're familiar with calculus, differential equations and linear algebra.
Just to give a short answer to the general physics question:

Stars are giant masses of hot hydrogen and helium. The temperature is high enough that much of the material is ionized - the protons and electrons are disassociated from each other. In the interior of the sun this ionized material can swirl around, and since it's made up of charged particles, the motion of those charged particles produces a magnetic field. The large-scale motions of this ionized material, particularly in the transitional layer between the outer surface that rotates like a normal fluid and the inner core that rotates more rigidly, are responsible for the changes in the sun's magnetic field over time.

But as already pointed out, these changes are basically periodic. We don't observe significant changes in average magnitude over time.

EDIT: And just to clarify, the strength of a magnetic field has no general correlation with entropy. Depending upon the system, the lowest entropy state could have 0 magnetic field or a large magnetic field, it all depends on the system. 
> There is a statement saying that the Sun's magnetic field has more than doubled in strength in the 20th century, deflecting more cosmic rays, decreasing cloud cover and leading to a temperature increase on Earth. 

* The sun's mean magnetic field strength hasn't changed appreciably over that time period. The sun's magnetic field switches polarity about every 11 years, but its mean value is essentially unchanged.

* Cosmic rays that approach earth are to some extent deflected by earth's magnetic field, but not to an appreciable degree by the sun's magnetic field as it appears in the vicinity of the earth.

> How could this field increase occur?

Not really necessary to say how, since it's not true -- the solar magnetic field's mean value is unchanged, and again, it switches polarity about every 11 years. And even if the sun's magnetic field did change, the primary magnetic deflection of cosmic rays near Earth is the Earth's magnetic field, not the sun's. Also, that deflection doesn't prevent cosmic rays from entering Earth's atmosphere, it only changes where they enter, not whether they enter.

My point? I think this is a crackpot theory. More here: [Henrik Svensmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Svensmark)
Nobody here knows what PHY 231 is.
Not too relevant, but just want to say that that was our undergraduate textbook, and I found it to be really great, both as a textbook alone and as a reference to come back to. Definitely my favourite comprehensive "physics" textbook. I didn't find it too theoretical at all really, it had a lot of exercises in if I recall correctly
>but it talks more about theory rather than giving me facts that I can actively use to solve real-world problems

Frankly this is the case with almost all physics. You learn the theory on the simplest idealised systems, which are often very far removed from real world problems. If that's what your module is about, focus on just learning the theory imo. Very frequently you have to suspend your intuition and just run with the ideas to see where you get, as their relevance or importance will not be immediately obvious. I had the same book for undergrad and thought it was great, lots of practice problems and very clear explanations.

>with the first hour typically spent on trying to solve review problems in the textbook

This is generally not at all a waste of time. Can you solve the problems easily without help?
If the book isn't working for you, seek out another at the library or online. We used Giancoli for freshmen physics and I thought it was pretty good. Halliday and Resnick is another popular book. There is no better way to learn intro physics than grappling with the book and doing problems. When I took it I found the book took me 90% of the way. The lectures about 8% and the labs 2%.

N.B. course numbers are different at every university so its not really useful to quote the number on reddit. You mentioned it was intro though so I get what you mean.
www.khanacademy.org/science/physics 

Khan academy is amazing for mini video lectures. I haven't been on the site in a while but remember it being very helpful for physics, chemistry, and math. 

Good luck and never underestimate the power of understanding theory. If you know the theory and the units then you won't even need to memorize equations because they will become intuitive. 
wikipedia...[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion#Bremsstrahlung_losses_in_quasineutral.2C_isotropic_plasmas).

The way you posed your question suggests a misunderstanding of the mechanism of bremsstrahlung. Though the ions participate, it is the electrons that are responsible for the majority of the bremsstrahlung radiation. The reason different *fuels* are quoted as having different bremsstrahlung losses is because the fuels require different conditions on the plasma to optimally produce fusion energy. The differences in these conditions imply different parameters for the electron component of the plasma. So the reaction does not determine the bremsstrahlung per se.
I would also be quite interested in any such resources as I'm currently researching nuclear fusion! Any help would be appreciated 
D-T fusion yields a Helium, a photon, and a neutron. Seeing as there is no energetic electron byproduct of D-T fusion there should be no bremmstrahlung radiation. This is of course not considering the conditions in which the reaction occurs which surely contains a large number of free electrons. 

I guess I'm not quite sure what you're asking in regards to bremmstrahlung and fusion. If you could clarify your question a bit I might be of more help.

Everyone here is posting links to Wikipedia articles about the Planck time and can't even be bothered to learn anything about it. From the Wiki article: 

> Because the Planck time comes from dimensional analysis, which ignores constant factors, there is no reason to believe that exactly one unit of Planck time has any special physical significance. Rather, the Planck time represents a rough time scale at which quantum gravitational effects are likely to become important

Put simply, we don't have a theory that discretizes time. Both quantum theory and general relativity use time as a continuous variable. 

And maybe the universe works that way. Maybe not. 
If you have a minimum time step in one reference frame, in another everything looks fucked up and the discrete steps happen at different times in different places, also the duration of the timestep is different. (Because of relativity of simultaneity and time dilation).

So you really need a *good* explanation for why we observe Lorentz invariance at large scales.

This turns out to be a really nasty problem. So one should first figure out how to even formulate this hypothesis coherently, and then maybe think about predictions.
It kind of sucks that you asked an interesting question but everyone's talking about the Planck time which has no relation to this. That said, I have no idea. You certainly can't measure anything more than ever once per "tick," so the simplest ideas are out the window. Does anyone have any ideas?
The Planck Time is not a time-pixel, it's just a constant constructed from physical parameters.
I don't know how to apply what I'm about to suggest to the physical world, but the math behind it is relevant to your question. Perhaps brighter minds than mine could adapt it to an experiment.

There are two equations worth mentioning called the [Logistic Function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) and the [Logistic Map](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map). The first is a continuous function, while the latter is discrete. The continuous function, perhaps analogous to an infinitely divisible time-step, shows a smooth transition between states, and generally comes to a steady state. The discrete map does not: it displays chaotic behavior, infinitely producing a pseudo-random string of outputs.

These functions are directly analogous in construction, but display qualitatively different behaviors based on the criteria your question gets at.
I believe conservation of energy requires continuous time symmetry. So if we would find small energy violations this could indicate time discretization. Very hypothetical though I'm just rambling.
I can't imagine any way to design an experiment that could measure this because any method of measurement is going to rely upon a mechanism of transferring information, and that is going to introduce issues of simultaneity mentioned here. This is an interesting thought experiment though. It keeps bringing me back to EPR! Hmmm...
Is spacetime quantized in LQG or can it be?
For the theorists, is there are theory out there that quantises time?
There is so called "doubly special relativity" but I don't know anything about predictions made by those theories.
I'm no expert, so forgive me if I have some horrible misconception, but don't we know the Planck length? Couldn't it just be the amount of time it takes for light (in a vacuum) to travel the Planck length? 
Such as the smallest distance that light can move that is measureable???

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time
Well the theoretical smallest unit of time is the planck second, which is defined as the time it takes light to travel 1 planck length, the smallest theoretical distance. Measuring this however is a different story. The world record for smallest unit of time measured is about 12 attoseconds (link to article below). This is about 2×10^26 planck seconds so in reality we are still very far away from being able to measure this.

That's unlikely.  The no-cloning theorem tells us that quantum teleportation is always going to be "destructive".

Not at all; I was making a poor joke based off of some of China's previous misadventures with space technology, like the Jade Rabbit dying and their space station that's slowly tumbling into Earth's atmosphere, as well as China's penchant for saying everything is going great with "X," when in fact it may be going terribly or at least not progressing as well as they say it is.
There's exactly no way you could have gotten that from my comment; thus, a poor joke.

Nobody agrees on this. All you can do is collect opinions.

Personally, I would say you are a physicist if your job, or the main thing you do with your life, principally consists of doing physics research. Given that definition and the normal progression of academia, that means the earliest you could call yourself a physicist would be as a PhD student who is done taking classes and is just working on research.
Yeah this is a hard question. The usual, very strong meaning I know of is someone who acquired a PhD in physics and actively does research in physics. This is quite a good definition when it comes to terms of "this guy surely knows what he's talking about". With this definition, Angela Merkel for example is not a physicist, even though she holds a PhD in physics - she doesn't do any research and she herself stated that "this was another life". It is also a definition that would hold most likely in court.

But then again I'd say, "to first order" a physicist is someone trying to figure out the fundamental workings of the universe on a serious scientific basis. This definition includes famous, historic physicists like Newton, even though he didn't acquire a PhD in physics. It also includes physics students, who as "physicists in training" do not do any serious scientific research, but learn the appropriate measures for it.
There isn't an official licensing organization for physicists (c.f. lawyers with state bars, medical doctors with state medical boards, etc.) and it's not illegal to represent yourself as a physicist without appropriate certification, so, go hog wild with it dude.
I think an undergraduate could call themselves a physicist if they have a keen interest in the field. I'd say that if you're coming to the end of your undergrad (at least in the UK) then it is fair to say you will be in your prime and know the most physics you'll ever know.

PhDs and postdocs actually tend to have *less* physics knowledge because all of their knowledge is concentrated in one very specialised area of physics.

For experimentalists this will mean that they have a deep understanding of the experimental procedure and tricks involved in building and operating an experiment, which may need a lot of knowledge that isn't even found in books.

For theorists though I'd say that they may never reach their prime, in that they attain more and more conceptual knowledge of the universe, but are still expected to be extremely fluent in the fundamentals and mathematics. It's acceptable for someone working in cold atoms to have forgotten their vector identities but for a theorist that won't be true. Theorists also have more required modules.

So I'd say: it depends what you mean, but there are really two definitions of physicist. Either,

1. Conceptual excellence. You feel like you understand a wide range of physics on an intuitive level, and feel fluent in solving problems and have some degree of knowledge at applying these concepts to real-life problems. You could probably come up with experiments to test many of the results you have learnt.

2. Practical excellence. You work as a part of an experimental research group and have a large amount of experience with your experimental setup. You have a large body of information that is specific to your experiment, but not required for a theoretical understanding of the subject. You are used to writing reports and notebooks, and improvising when things go wrong.

All undergraduates (in the UK) approach number 1, and depending on your dedication and module choices, I'd say you could come close to attaining it in an undergrad.

Normal physicists (not theoretical) will also get a bit of 2 under their belt.

Theoretical physicists will probably never learn any of 2, and will continue with 1.

Also I don't know if its just my uni, but pretty much everyone, even from first year, refers to each other/themselves as "physicists". If you see a group of physics students you will call them "physicists" generally. The theory students are referred to as "theorists". Then again our department is extremely inclusive in that respect.
Last week, /r/math had a similar discussion about when it was appropriate to call yourself a mathematician. The answer I found most true is that you're a mathematician when you have a PhD and are paid to do research in the field.

https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/53es03/at_what_point_can_you_call_yourself_a/
Personally, I would say if you are studying physics full time and/or conducting physics research.
I call myself a physicist, because I have a bachelor's degree in physics.  I enjoy reading and talking about the latest advances in astronomy and in particle physics, but I have never actually participated in said research.

My job is to teach mathematics.  I have a master's degree in mathematics.  I have a hard time calling myself a mathematician, because I never really "got" mathematics research.
"Physicist" isn't strictly defined, essentially anyone can call themselves a physicist if they are actively engaged in the study of physics. If you love the subject then I would avoid assigning meaningless labels to people based on their level of experience.
Clearly when you actually do physics. learning physics is not doing physics. Im an 3rd year undergrad. I am not a physicist. It would not be fair to claim to be. 

has to be when you actually do a PHD
The only way phycisists can test if two particles were entangled at the point of measurement is to meet up afterward and compare notes. Locally you can't tell the difference. That makes your experiment less than practical. 

While I don't know of any polls, I think it's fair to say the majority of phycisists who think about this issue don't actually think information is lost.  I recommend Susskind 's book Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics. Or find some youtube videos where he talks about the black hole wars.
I think the least problematic aspect of your proposed experiment is that it needs a black hole.
EDIT: A warning to others who might think about replying to a question like this one. All too often, a poster posts what appears to be a question about a crackpot theory, but the post's real purpose is to publicize the original crackpot idea, masquerading as a question. Then someone foolishly replies to the faux question by correctly identifying the original content as unphysical nonsense, as crackpottery. Then the OP downvotes the technically correct reply.

Such things happen every day in technical forums. The point? The OP wants the original post to stand as "proof by popular acclaim" (*argumentum ad populum*) of the original crackpot idea, he doesn't actually want anyone replying to it, except possibly in innocent adulation.

So it goes.

-------------------------------------------

Define "for real". Can these ideas be tested for feasibility? No, they can't. Are they science? Already answered by saying they can't be tested.

As just one example of nonsense, in [this patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US20060112848?dq=ininventor:%22John+St.+Clair%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj64e_Gxa3PAhWCOxQKHahCBXEQ6AEISDAG) the submitter juxtaposes magnetic fields and spacetime curvature as though they have some relation to each other. They don't -- the patent is nonsense, and was issued only because patent examiners don't actually review the content of submissions any more.

I mean, it's not as though patent examiners are Einsteins.
The reason the delta function exists is because it is very useful.  Probably the first place that you'll see it is in electrostatics when you're talking about point charges.  It is convenient to work with the density of a charge because coulomb's law is only valid for infinitesimally small charges.  So you set up Coulomb's law with a density and then integrate that relation over a volume to end up with a force in the end.  So what is the density of a point charge? Its volume is infinitely small, but it has a finite charge.  So its density is infinite at the one exact position it exists, and zero every where else.   This means you need a function that you can integrate over exactly one point and get a finite value.  This is the definition of a delta function.  
I think it all boils down to the Dirac delta being a) the Fourier transform of 1 and b) the identity for convolutions, both fundamental tools for physics. Or more simply, it's literally the simplest nontrivial functional you can think of.
I don't have a physics background, so I won't talk about the necessity of the delta function in physics.  I can talk a little about your side note, though.  It's a little deceptive to say that the delta function "exists" - there is no Riemann-integrable function that is zero everywhere off of the origin and has total mass one (i.e. integrates to one).  So the delta function isn't a "function" in the ordinary sense of the word.  But it behaves a lot like one.  For example, we can multiply it by a scalar, integrate it, etc.  So we bend the rules a little and let it into the club, since it might be useful to have around.  Formally, the dirac delta function is a measure (or more generally a distribution).  We just call it a function since it's convenient to think of it that way.  It has its own wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function).
Many calculations also would give you the same if you did them with a gaussian distributio, but it's just simpler to use the dirac delta. 
Though I have to say I ran into troubles with that once ...
I believe Delta function, solely, cannot be understood in a physical way because it doesn't make any sense when you look at just a Delta function without anything else. It is a mathematical tool.

Say you need to describe charge density on a space. But the catch is there are no charges anywhere else and all the charges are concentrated at the origin. Using Delta function one can build a function which describes this situation perfectly. 
[Green's functions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function)
I don't agree with some of the points made in the article.  First, I'll make it known that I'm a graduate student studying chemical physics, and I've taken 2 graduate-level quantum mechanics classes.  Therefore, I'm by no means an expert just yet.  However, I am certain of the following things (correct me if I'm wrong): 

First, this segment bothers me:
>That moment when particle physics merge with classical mechanics is called decoherence. In terms of physics, it is when time’s direction becomes mathematically important. 

It bothers me because even in quantum mechanics, you have time-dependence in the wavefunction for solutions of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.  If you know the state of a particle at time=0 and you know the form of the propagator to advance its state to time=t, then you have the solution to the wavefunction at any time t.  It doesn't have to be classical at all for this to happen.

Second, why are they claiming gravity is the driving force behind time?  Gravity to me is just the effect caused by the warping of spacetime.  I get it that relativity brings space and time together as one entity, among other things, but how can a particle "being too small" to feel the effects of gravity mean that it experiences no time?  Based on the above point, this is clearly false because we already know there are time-dependent quantum mechanical solutions everywhere.

I guess my main problem is this: sure we don't know how or why time goes in the direction it does, but the points the author brings up to try to explain the direction make no sense to me.  I would love to hear other people's thoughts on this.
Agreed.
I agree that humans gave olden a scale 
One thing that a lot of people greatly benefit from is finding a good a psychologist they can talk to. It sounds like this is a question you need to figure out for yourself and having someone there to just listen to you can be very helpful. 

Personally I work in an applied physics field and love it. The academic route can be extremely difficult and often far less fulfilling. Just know there are a lot of options out there  
Taking a break from physics was what I needed to understand how truly passionate I am about it. I was under the assumption I didn't want to push myself in an academic way until I realized how much less I wanted to do anything else.
"All you have" is a PRB and another paper in the works and you've not even started a PhD yet? That's pretty good, actually (if you're the first author).

Of course, if you don't like doing it, you should not continue.
The good news is plenty of physics guys end up in the software business.  Come on over, the water's fine!
Sometimes, all it takes is a different project to renew your interest. I personally had a bad experience in graduate school and left at the masters level. I got a great job as a spacecraft controller, and I would have stayed had I not chosen to move overseas. Now I'm in my 40s, and I've decided to go back and get that PhD in a different area of physics. I'm enjoying every minute of it. A good project with lots of potential can make all the difference. I've completely lost all interest in my previous area of research, but I love what I'm doing now.
The word "hate" is the clue that your problem is not physics.
I get this feeling to, mostly of self doubt, I also feel a bit annoyed at myself when I'm reading the textbooks for example and then I don't have the follow up questions as you progress, because I don't really know what to think a lot of times and feel like I don't know enough it's weird I guess. But I definitely understand. Not sure if this helps and may just sound silly but I have the feelings as I wouldn't be able to explain half the stuff if I were asked so yeah I'm missing quite a bit of knowledge to but at times I'm fine with that as I know there's so much info and I'll probably never get to it even though I wish I could. 
Also, if you need a little inspiration I think you should pick up a book about Feynman, " Surely, you're joking Mr. Feynman," it's pretty fun and quite an interesting take on physics but more so life and not worrying about things. If you have the time give it a read, kind of a weird way to plug it but I think it can be somewhat helpful?
That's perfectly fine. Just because you are at the end of your master's it does not mean that you can't switch directions after. With a physics degree you're actually wanted in a lot of different areas. I would advise just finishing the degree and not dropping it. Afterwards you look what you can get. For example in banks and other businesses they are looking for physicists all the time. Also in jobs that deal with software development. I actually saw offers which explicitly stated they were looking for mathematicians and physicists that needed no knowledge in programming at all.
I'm doing physics as well, but when I was depressed, I sure as hell wasn't getting A grades, I couldn't even manage to do the coursework. Now that I beat that depression, I have that creativity and the drive to do more than what is set out in front of me. I currently use any free time I get learning neat things, like how to code, electronics etc. I aim to start using Scipy to model things, I want to work on AI programs and robotics as well - these goals will take me quite a lot of effort and patience, but they are things my course would never show me. I actually spend a lot of time thinking about ways I can make things better, I have all of these ambitions that were vacant before, and now I'm retaking Physics, it is very different. 

I guess my point is 'don't be depressed' - have you tried that? /s

When you do beat it, things will be better, and like other people suggested, ask for help. I got through it without help, and it took 5 years, your time is worth it.
I'm currently going through a similar situation. I initially worked in the field QCD for my bachelor's thesis, but I disliked the people in the group I have been working. Further listening to lectures of advanced quantum field theory, I completely lost the interest into the topic. So I switched the field for my master's thesis. The people in my new group were all really nice and I really enjoyed their company. My project particularly dealt with the study of neutrino reactions, but was part of a highly interdisciplinary subfield of physics. So my coworkers only had a bare clue about what I've been working on, and so did I about their work. I searched guidance from my professor, but he was rather acting as a manager between the topics the students have been working on. Having a brilliant clue about how the different fields his students are working on are connected and what might be future topics to investigate, but lacking to varying degree of more detailed knowledge. So I ended up working on a project with bare mentorship. Although I did a great job at it, I completely lost my mind doing so. I ended up declining the offer for a PhD position and I'm now doing a sabbatical. I still feel a great passion for science in myself, but have problems figuring out whether or not I can abandon this passion or integrate it differently into my future life. So I'm sorry that I really can't give you any advice on how to handle your current situation. But at least I can assure you that you are not alone. 
you have to ask you, why you start in the first place with physics? also why you choose Solid State physics? (i hated it to from my first course in it, then i begun researching on my own will some things, now i will go and take a course in it, simply because i felt i need to know something in that direction)

well is there nobody you can talk to? like other study buddies, people in the department? whoever could give a new perspective?

in the end you have to answer the questions on your own? and if you should continue?
I knew I hated physics by the end of my second year. But by then I didn't want to setback myself by 2 years to start a new degree. I worked super hard in my masters year to pull my overall grades up. I looked for what it was that I did enjoy in the degree, programming problem solving... I ended up taking an engineering position working in software support. Not even a job I wanted, just the first interview happened to say yes to me. Eventually through following what I enjoy I moved into engineering sales and now sales management. 


The cool thing with a physics degree is it teaches you a large amount of transferable skills to go for pretty much any job. Mathematics, problem solving, critical thinking, technical writing, programming, data analysis/modeling, presenting on results and communicating technical concepts. Think about things you enjoy and look for a job where you can do it and leverage your skills you earned at uni.
Truth is I plowed through a PhD without being as truly passionate about it as many people are. It worked out fine, but in hindsight would I have sacrificed my 20s working really hard for no money? Probably not.

Anyway, my advice is don't be one of those strange people who are one class short of finishing. Put your head down, finish the master's, and then reevaluate. That's a good way to get on paper what you've done while giving yourself a chance to pivot.

Also, another thing that helped me is making friends outside of physics. You need to get away from it in your free time.
I started developing significant issues with anxiety and depression in the final year of undergraduate, not really recognizing that's what was happening. I had significant mental health issues when i first entered graduate school for physics; I had episodes of panic attacks, self-medication, substance abuse, and even suspected mania (though I'm still skeptical of this one, a psychologist i saw is convinced). I left the first PhD program with a masters, and transferred to another to try and alleviate the issues via environment and work place relations, but all they did was come back. That was important data; after I realized this, I realized the problem was myself, not the research field or my co-workers. Process of elimination with the self hurts.

I decided to make myself and my health my research project for awhile. I became obsessed with it to a point that my doctors almost considered it as part of my pathology. I read about psychology and psychiatry to try an allay my initial skepticism of them as science (they are science, too, by the way, they just have less "experimental power" by design, very frustrating, but so it goes). I looked into doctors and learned about health insurance. I started trying to be more self aware of myself and my health, and believe me you, it was not easy, and it was a very, very slow process. It was made slower by the fact that I was taking classes and teaching and doing research and doing qualifiers all at the same time, but in hindsight I still managed to learn a lot of physics while learning about myself. You often don't know what you know until you use what you know far after the point where you didn't understand the topic enough for the final/problem sets, yielding a sympathy B from your graduate course professors. Deflating? Yes, but I stubbornly held on.

After two therapists, two psychiatrists, a "coach" who was familiar with working while coping with analogous issues, three seasons of Bojack Horseman, two years in one program floundering, two years floundering in another, two years of stubbornly pursuing a mental state that is both productive and healthy, and way way too many copays and medical bills, I finally figured out what I needed to "tick" properly. I solved the mini-research problem that was myself and my head. Over the past two most recent years, my professional life is slowly being put back together and physics has actually become gratifying again. I now am certain I can finish my PhD in good graces, and maybe even do a solid post doc before entering the professional world. I can say for certain that two years ago, I would never have guessed ever feeling that way.

No one here is going to be able to tell you if physics is for you or not, in any capacity. But what I can tell you from my own personal experience is this; mental health issues can attack everything in your life, even the things you're most passionate about, and they are very capable of making you feel not like you. Left unchecked, they will change you to the core, and leave you as someone you find impossible to recognize in the mirror. Before you decide to throw-away physics, which you clearly love or would not be bothering posting here, you should try very very hard to solve the most important physics problem you have in your life now; yourself and your head, and how to cope with the emotional rollercoaster that is academia, that can reduce even the healthiest of us to anxious, depressed wrecks at times.

Good luck out there.
I'm starting my master's in physics, in the area of computational electromagnetics. Sometimes I get frustrated with the theoretical side, as it seems most of my work which leads anywhere is just replication: someone else beat me to it and did a better job. But then I dig into the programming side, building tools and simulations, getting immediate results and enjoying the design aspect, and before too long I'm bored out of my mind and come back to the physics with enthusiasm. Maybe a bit of a break will reawaken your passion! Do something radically different which interests you, but don't close any doors. If you love physics after all you'll come back; if you don't you shouldn't.
Wish I could get straight As without trying
I recognize that this may not mean much coming from an undergrad, but it may help if you take the time to delve into some interesting links to physics, rather than just physics itself. Maybe take a look at materials science since you are already doing solid state. Or maybe look at some chemistry or biology. It helps make things really cool again when you see how the little nitpicky physics turns out on the large scale. It worked for me at least. 
Did you go to SFU for Mechatronics? 
I decided to become a technician after getting my MSci, nearly everyone else went off to do a PhD.  
Absolutely do not regret it one bit. I just did not have the passion to do research in one small field, so it'd have been a waste of my time, my supervisor's time, the department's funding, and a place that someone else could have taken.

You absolutely don't need to stay in academia or even in the physics field.
Felt the same way my entire time at UCSB. Some of the worst years of my life were spent there.
As a person of deduction, what do you *want*?
Hey! So I had similar problem with depression and in the second year I almost dropped Physics. However, in the third year I asked one of my prof. if I can work in his department - he said yes and it was probably one of my best decisions,  because I actually used the things I've been studying like crazy. Long story short, due to the valuable experience in my field that I had at the time of the graduation, I got a really cool job in one of the largest international projects - now I wouldn't change a thing and I am glad that I stayed in physics. 
I'm seriously thinking about quitting physics for good. I'm doing data analysis in particle physics (on CMS data) and seeing how my supervisor and his co-workers pull 60+ hours a week just to get an annual paper out doesn't look very... rewarding. Even if they'd give a gold pot. It's now especially exhausting b/c I have to complete some of the uni courses and still want to maintain my nearly-perfect GPA. And the tasks in particle physics don't give a fuck what time it is, they must be completed asap.

I probably start looking for a job next semester, possibly a software dev gig, since I have some experience in that field already. At least in private sector I don't have to bring work to home as I do right now. And the pay is higher and stable.

Whelp, back to work I guess.

ninja edit: I'm completing my masters as well
This resonates so strongly with me, a few years ago I went through something very similar during my masters degree. I found it personally difficult to study when I disliked physics, best thing to do as others is said is to talk to someone. It becomes so much easier when you talk to someone, you might find this helps bring back the love of studying a subject, thankfully it did for me.
I was studying physics in one of the best (if not the best) university here. I loved the subject and when i was at highschool i knew i wanted to became a physicist. In my 5th semester i was so tired, so bored of physics... short story, i quit. I started studying computer science and one year later i realized how much i love physics. I came back to my old school and was really cool. 
I think you just need a break. 
For what it's worth I'm finishing my masters this year and cannot wait to start PhD. I'm still in love with physics and really don't want to stop doing it any time soon, so if you're feeling this way perhaps your mind is already made up. 
Hey man! I'm in the same boat, except I'm a bit younger and I happen to like physics.

Suffering together is ALWAYS better than suffering alone; PM me.
Well, I'm not as far as you are, but as someone who has had epilepsy, depression, and social anxiety his whole life, I can at least sympathize some. I was pushed away from engineering too, and it was also because of some near-suicidal thoughts.

The only things in your post that differ from my experience, are that you're further along than me, and that you haven't discovered any cool/interesting things to fascinate yourself with. I've been obsessed with physics since I was like...idk, five or something. Right now my obsession is quantum gravity, and the dream is to figure it out so we can start manipulating gravity. Just...for coolness's sake and because space travel.

Honestly though: I think epilepsy helped me more with my fascination with physics than anything else. idk why, but every time I have a seizure, I can't help but shove my face into some physics reading. It's like a compulsion that takes over me, lol. Now that they're more under control (two years seizure free as of exactly one week ago!) it's less of a compulsion to do the stuff, and it is NOT helping with motivation...but I am definitely more clear headed and actually able to handle the content. It's like the seizures make the abstract thinking easier for grasping the uber-complex stuff.

Which leads me to some maybe suggestions: Read some nonfiction, non-textbook stuff about the history of physics. Go out in nature for long hikes; there's no better way to grow an appreciation for physics than to see it in action outside the lab. Take the first wild idea about the universe you have, and fill a whiteboard with it, math drawings or whatever. Do some stress-free explorations of physics, and eventually maybe you'll be able to put your sights on something long-term that will let you drag yourself through the BS of academia till you can do that one thing. Or, just quit and become an artist, apparently we epileptics have a knack for abstract creativity :P

Man, I hate Solid State Physics, too.  Particle Physics, on the contrary, is a very cool and satisfying subject. 

Edit: WTF, so much solid state physicians here?

You might want to have a look at the weekly Careers/Education thread. 

A physicist can do a variety of jobs in the industry, and when people say that they went corporate for better pay and hours, they usually mean that they're no longer doing physics per se, but indeed working as software developers or the like. 

A lot of the jobs out there can be quite technical, where having a relatively mathematical background, such as a PhD in physics, can be helpful on the job and sometimes even a requirement to pass CV screening. A degree in physics is and is seen as one giving a good overview of a lot of things and as proof one can solve technical problems. That's why if you're not sure who to hire, you might go for a physicist. As the field becomes more standardized, specific degrees will often be crafted, like what happened in machine learning, data science and financial engineering.

Some of the more technical jobs remain close to academia in that you will be reading articles and maybe even publishing. Typically though what's different between academia and rhe industry is the robustness of the methodology: You often want something that can be trusted to be automated rather than the fanciest way of doing things where you sometimes need to guide things by hand to get best possible fit to some experimental data. This means that one tends to build on what exists even more in the industry instead of doing something completely new from scratch.

Obviously many physicists opt for the less technical jobs or ones that don't really utilize any of their training except "general problem solving".

Generalizations are difficult to make here, and you should ideally be asking your questions about some more specific job.
I am a PhD physicist who went straight from grad school to an industry job.  I did it for access to better problems.  The academic research I did in school was very challenging and rewarding but also very esoteric.  Through conferences and workshops, I knew personally all 20 people in the world that cared about the work I was doing.  I knew there had to be better way of picking problems to work on.

I think there is far too much focus on the freedom to choose your research subject.  Most academic research is so specific and narrow that you couldn't possibly have had a burning desire to make that particular measurement before you started.  Mostly the freedom to choose is a myth, anyway, as it is heavily influenced by budget, ability to publish and many other factors out of your control.

The greater joy is in the freedom to choose how to solve problems of value.  The opportunity to science the shit out of a problem that 1000's or millions of people will benefit from is a lot of fun.  Knowing that the problem has value is important and people will let you know this by giving you money for the solution/product.

To your actual question though, I make products.  Just like an engineer, but with a lot more physics.  I have made instrumentation, sensors, and now domestic appliances.  Physics is in all of these things and learning how it applies to them is the real joy.

The fact that I make twice as much money as a university professor is nice too.
There are some private corporations (especially DoD contractors) that do basic research. If you manage to snag a job at one of these places, they will hire you to simply perform experiments and publish in your field just like an academic. Ultimately, the goal is to provide the company with future assets and keep them competitive; for the most part, however, you are free to explore ideas which you find exciting and novel.
There are great answers above. I will add that even at national labs and universities (non-industry) there are jobs for physicists. The advanced photon source APS at Argonne national lab employs many physicists to work on the beam line. Other examples would be at NIF at LLNL or they have laser scientists as well. Not all require Ph.D's so I thought I'd mention it in case an undergrad or grad student is unaware of the options available after graduation. 
'Industry' is such a catch-all general term for 'non-government/non-university' work. It's not really useful because, as you said, it can range from software engineering to actual research. 

There are some private companies that just do research work. For example, in my field, you have General Fusion and Tri Alpha Energy who have "industry" scientists doing research. (And, as a counter-example, in my field, you can also have software engineering like the plasma packages for COMSOL.)
The way I see it, if you're a physicist then your job is to be smart. They're going to put you to work on some problem where there isn't a traditional job that handles it because it's an unusual problem and you just have to figure out a solution. From Feynman's biography, he worked as head chemist for a plastic plating company with no prior experience in that field of work either. His approach was just to try a bunch of different stuff to see what works and then go from there. He worked on the Manhattan project, on the investigation for the challenger explosion, at his son's company in I can't remember what, you get my point.
For my part, I used my extensive experience in modeling data (along with some rigorous additional self-learning) to make a transition into the industry of Data Science.

It's a very well-paid, intellectually rewarding career, and many of the skillsets you use in physics analysis are useful - statistics, probability theory, statistical mechanics, and so on. Many theoretical discoveries in physics are now applied towards the realm of machine learning and statistical inference for businesses. And did I mention it was well-paid? Your starting salary will already be competitive with most physics professors, and it only goes up from there.
There is also the field of [geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics). I've known many of them over the years who worked in the oil & gas industry doing 3-D seismic work.  Others career possiblities, such as earthquake science, etc are indicated in the  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics) article. I believe that degree program is commonly through a separate Geophysics department (or perhaps a combined Geology and Geophysics, or Earth Sciences department),  though I have heard of those having a traditional physics degree with a minor in geology working as geophysicists. 

I don't know what the current job market is for them.

If of interest, here are a couple reddit links:

I'd like to mention one other work possibiity for physicists (anyone in STEM, actually). Admittedly, it might appeal only to a small subset of physics majors, but my experience in industry is that it's a much sought-after combination.  That is to combine a BS in physics (or STEM) with an MBA.  Many companies love the combination of a technical degree with an MBA.  Once you're in the company, they'll assume you're smart enough to do anything and they'll likely want to groom you for higher level jobs, including management jobs. They'll look for interpersonal and leadership type skills.  This is a niche area, really, but I've known so many STEM grads going in this direction, and their feedback has been generally positive. Most I've known get a job first, then go for the MBA at night (often with tuition support from the company) or take an educational leave of absence (frequently granted).  If this at all appeals to you as an undergrad going for just a BS, I'd suggest discussing that route when interviewing for a job.  My experience with this is limited to the USA, I assume this is common worldwide but I have limited experience with that  (maybe someone could comment?).
My experience is working with computational engineers to help them better understand the physics they simulate. To the best of my knowledge, most physicists are used for their problem solving ability 
I ended up doing Bioanalytics, and doing research and development of assays and what not for that. It's not pure physics, but it's still the part about science I love doing.  YMMV ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
There's also a lot of finance jobs for physicists, which makes sense because almost every model in finance is a physics equation originally (heat equation for example). There are some new fields like econophysics which are heavily simulation based too.
in my country a lot of physicists end up in software engineering, because it pays good (there is not a lot of sci. sw here, but apps, business software...). of course you have to know some c#, cpp or java beforehand...
Tracking!! as simple as that, it is not hard to get low gain, Omni-directional for RF, but for optical you need precision tracking and alignment.

With high power low earth orbit an RF link is trivial to achieve, but try aligning a laser and photodiode with an object in fast orbit is basically impossible. 
> Is there any reason optical links can't be used between satellites and ground stations?

Yes, there is -- clouds, thermal disturbances in the atmosphere, and smog.

> It doesn't seem like the atmospheric absorption at optical and RF frequencies is that different.

There is a world of difference between microwave and optical transmission through the atmosphere.
I think refraction is quite a bigger concern for optical in atmosphere than absorption. Stars twinkle and all that.
Arbitrary. The point is that the true ground state energy is the lowest possible answer, but might be difficult to calculate. You substitute a trial family of functions which are easy to calculate, find the lowest energy that family can generate, and hope it's a good approximation. More flexibility (i.e. more parameters) makes it more likely that you can better approximate the true wavefunction, but also means more work. So there's a tradeoff when trying to calculate efficiently.
You can use as many as you want.
Hi, I used both of these books. The Walker version is much newer. It's twice as heavy, because it's full of colorful pictures of, like, roller coasters and surfers, but it has the exact same material. I thought the Krane book was much more to-the-point.
One of the textbooks is the fifth edition (2002), the other is the tenth edition (2014). To me that would seem more important than the fact that one of the three authors has changed.

> Is any one version better than the other?

If one accepts the premise that newer editions have more errors fixed or are more up-to-date with events in physics, then the newer book would be a better choice.
You are not wrong. I think that focusing on metrics (e.g. H-index, number of papers/books/plenary talks, etc) will always promote "gaming" the system. Those best at the game win steady career paths; though they might not be the best. Good researchers get through the system too though. Grant writing is more of a black art. 15% success is quite good. Knowing someone at the funding agency can make this much higher. Metrics ruin the funding process in some ways because there is more focus on deliverables than breakthroughs. How many game changing ideas have been shelved due to impending deadlines?  It's a tough game and can see why it's not appealing to you. There are some people who go through the process honestly still and have great ideas. Good luck. 
I have recently been troubled by this. I am currently an working on my undergrad, and I had hopes of getting a PhD and doing research as a career. However, I have recently met a professor who described what you just said. That the field of research is highly political, unproductive, and unscientific. It has somewhat turned me off to becoming a researcher, as I had thought before that funding was provided for the best quality of research, not to the most published or the most "effective" research.

All I want is to do good, high quality research. I want to document possible solutions to unknowns, while being honest with the conclusiveness of my results. 

Is this just a pipe dream? Would I be better off becoming an engineer and trying to find a job doing corporate research? I have a deep passion for the physical sciences, and am willing to work as hard as it takes, I just don't want to get to the end of the road only to find I have taken the wrong directions.
> The present funding system rewards “effectiveness” and low-risk-low-return results 

Yup.  The problem is that the funding levels have been consistently decreasing relative to the number of PhDs.  The older scientists tell me of a time when proposals were funded at a rate of around 1 in 2 to 3 proposals, now it's less than 1 in 10 proposals.  

Solution?  Talk to your Congressmen, or convince Google to fund basic science.  Otherwise, it's only going to get worse.  

Grad students: get out while you can.
Final year grad student here. Couldn't agree more. I am not even applying for any post-doc positions. This is not because I don't think I could secure one, but because the academic system is so flawed. As you say, it promotes good businessmen above good scientists, and if I wanted to go into business I could just do that and earn much more in another sector. 

Also yes the funding system is appalling. 99% of published science is mundane bullshit that wouldn't be funded if the public knew what they were paying for. Read any grant proposal and compare it with the actual research that came out of that funding and it's clear what a bunch of lies grant proposals are.

So what are the options for those interest in physics research in the US? Move to another country? Go to the private sector?
Posts like these are really discouraging.
Scientist here. A few comments:

* Yes, the system has its problems, but all systems do. There will always be more ideas, and more people who want to be scientists, than we can ever fund. The question is how (not if) we prioritize.  Longer-term grants (at least 5 , probably 10 years) is my personal partial solution. Would science be better if we had a central bureau that decided on projects? Because that's how most corporations work.
* One of the biggest problems in science is that there are too many postdocs and others on temporary contracts. It's too easy to become a postdoc, too difficult to take the next step to a permanent job.
* It's a lot, lot tougher to be average in science than in industry.
* Corporations are not rational or devoid of politics either, far from. Bullshit ideas from top management get pushed through all the time. It's just that in companies it's all happening behind closed doors.
> but because number of publications is probably the #1 criterion by which they are judged on for jobs in academia.

Not always. Experimental high-energy physics is an interesting case: the collaborations are so large and complex that it is hard to tell who contributed how much to which publication. As result, every member of the collaboration gets listed as author at (nearly) every publication, alphabetically. You can finish your PhD with some three-digit number of publications where you are listed as author (one out of >1000, potentially always as first author if you name starts with Aab or Aad), many of them in high-impact journals. From outside, you cannot tell who did what unless you ask for references. In CVs, you'll often see the publication list reduced to "papers with significant contribution" - and those contributions described for each paper.

The organization is also different. You have the organization via the institutes and grants (where the money gets distributed) and the organization via the collaborations (where the science and also the less interesting but necessary work get distributed). Working on risky topics is not easy, but you always have other projects ongoing, so you don't end up with nothing. Some high-risk high-gain projects are mainly done by seniors - if it doesn't work out they don't lose as much as PhD students or postdocs.
Condensed matter PhD here (transport/correlated materials). 


This is interesting to hear from a plasma physicist, since most of this phenomenon, as far as I can remember, has been reported in the context of life/social sciences.


From my own experience it seems to be much tougher to produce fluff papers and have them end up in APS or Nature. When my purpose is to read exciting new papers, I mostly pull from APS - Editors Suggestions, or PRB Rapid Comms (and I think most people do as well) or field specific journals. I only really ever dive into the "B catalogue" as it were when I am looking for something specific, like some particular spectroscopic result, etc. 


Your example there "change a parameter in our code and get this new result", is not necessarily an invalid or low quality insight if the result is important enough (to enable some particular system to function correctly, for example). Discoveries have been made by exploring what happens when you evaluate a perturbative calculation to 13th order, etc. I won't comment on your specific case as I have no idea about your field, but I could map this to growth conditions for films, where someone just happens to discover a good recipe and reports it. I think this is important enough to share, and when it's supplemented with some nice structural analysis, for example, can make for a nice reference work. 


There were some nice articles about income inequality in Nature recently. I don't think this is an issue. When it becomes unfeasible to continue in academia you'll see a movement to industrial science positions. I personally am not aiming to end up in academia at all, and a lot of my fellow colleagues share this sentiment, so that effect is already in play I think.
Hi there, I'm a postdoc working on quantum computing in Australia.  I'd like to respond to your rant, since I think young scientists like you and I generally don't take nearly the responsibility that we should for the role we play in the system that exists today.  I of course understand that you're writing, in part at least, out of emotion.  But I think that any current or aspiring scientists out there should have the opportunity to read at least one rebuttal to what you have said.

> I have seen and experienced some of the processes by which science is done in this country, the production process of science so to speak, and I think it’s pretty bad.

I think there are certainly problems, but I don't agree that they're as categorically bad as you make out.  Or, at least, I think that you have more agency in this process than you might realize.

> The whole system is heavily based on people in the so called “soft-money” positions.  Those are people who don’t have tenure or are not in stable positions in their institutions. [...] As you can imagine, this is a very stressful situation to be in. Tenured and stable positions are getting more and more rare and competition is fierce.

But a postdoc develops a great many highly transferrable skills.  People in industry would *kill* to have jobs like ours.  Our jobs give us a great deal of intellectual freedom and boundless opportunities for continued learning.  We often get to lead other scientists (i.e. grad students) in their work and communicate our work to non-experts.  Hiring managers salivate when they see a well-prepared résumé from a seasoned postdoc.

What you are describing is quite natural when you view academia as an employer's market.  There are many more qualified applicants than there are positions.  But, again, most people in industry would *kill* to have résumés that look like ours.

> As a result of this system, creativity is being pushed aside by “effectiveness”.

Is it?  Are you telling me that a scientist with an excellent idea that gains a lot of attention wouldn't have Ivy League universities filling his or her email box with job offers?  Creativity and effectiveness are not orthogonal.

> And scientists are very effective in delivering (guess what?) low-risk-low-return – and sometimes inaccurate - articles.

No argument there.  But I think the fault lies with *us*.  The best way to evaluate science or a scientist is to have other scientists evaluate it or him or her.  We simply haven't come up with a better way to do that.  I'm working on this; are you?

> The notorious “publish or perish” culture is detrimental to science. 

I agree that this is a problem, but I don't think you're assigning the blame correctly and I don't think you're proposing reasonable solutions.

> In this system, a scientist to be successful he/she needs to be good at not only doing scientific work but also at selling their idea, which I think not often come hand-in-hand. Quite the opposite, in fact. Great scientists are usually terrible at marketing their idea.

I **completely** disagree with this.  The best thinkers generally (never mind scientists) are capable of providing effective summaries of their thought on demand to any audience.

Also keep in mind that scientists are publicly funded and are therefore public servants.  You owe it to the public to explain what you are doing and why you are doing it in a way that they can understand.  If you can't do that, I'm afraid I question whether the public purse should be used to pay your salary when you are eminently employable in other fields of human endeavour.

> Science has become too corporate and hierarchical. And becoming corporate is a great innovation killer.

Yeah, when has a private corporation ever invented anything? /s

> At the center of this system is the way by which science is funded. 

You have a very US-centric approach to this.  Many postdocs, like myself, are willing to travel to other countries to ply our trade.  If you don't like the American approach, why not move to a new country?  Almost every Physics department I've visited, let alone been associated with, was composed primarily of immigrants — including American immigrants.

> The way these grants are selected is also another problem in my opinion. Successful grant proposal writers know how to craft their proposals just the right way.

Presumably you think that the right way within the current system is different from the actual right way.  I challenge you to explain what you think a good standard of evaluating grant proposals would look like.

> Some non-tenured researchers that I've worked with have told me that they spend almost HALF of their time working on proposal writing. Either doing preliminary work or writing the proposal itself or just planning what they are going to write about.

That's what managers do.  If you don't want the job, don't ask for it.  Find a new job.  Again, you're eminently qualified for jobs that others would kill for.

> The way grant review panels work is that they’re trying to judge a proposal basically on two things, impact on the field and likelihood of success.

You seem to assume, falsely, that grant review panels are categorically incapable of finding a reasonable trade-off between these two important criteria.  I've known several scientists who have worked on grant review panels and, while they are human and therefore fallible, I have yet to meet a scientist who routinely participates in the grant review process that shouldn't be doing it.

I strongly suggest you find some people who have worked on these grant review panels and ask them (a) how they form their opinions, and (b) whether they think the review process is largely fair and reasonable.

> But everybody knows that's not how it works.

I don't know that.  I think that any serious endeavour requires intelligent project management.  You seem to think that science happens because smart people sit in a room and look out the window for eight hours a day until inspiration strikes.  I think that's a myth.

I'd hazard a guess at this point that you're a theorist.  So am I, but I have enough experimentalist friends to know how bad project management causes good scientists to become completely unproductive and unmotivated..

> You can't predict what problems your research will have and how you will overcome it, it's silly.

Well, maybe *you* can't.  Again, have a chat with a successful senior scientist and ask them their advice about how to do things like this and whether they think it's possible.

> If you don't work with science you may be surprised to learn how researchers talk about a “low-hanging fruit” and a LPU (“Least publishable unit”) when talking about the papers and grant proposals they are going to write instead of talking about how excited they are about a new idea they are pursuing that could be really relevant to the field. As expected, this whole system leads to a dramatic nose dive in terms of quality and relevance of published work.

Are you really expecting every paper written to be worthy of the Nobel prize?  This argument is completely free of cogency, let alone evidence.  Surely you think that scientists should take care to publish even incremental results so that other scientists can learn from their work and perhaps extend upon it?

> Besides that, the proposal selection process is extremely subjective.

Is it?  My impression, in quantum computing at least, is that the work that definitely ought to be funded is reliably funded.  It's competitive, sure, and there's all sorts of sleaze if you go digging for it.  But it's not a *lottery*.

> I actually heard this exact phrase from a more senior colleague of mine about the proposal selection process. If you write a good proposal, you get a lottery ticket. Depending on the opportunity, I'd say between 30% and 60% of the proposals are well-crafted proposals. Success rates in my field lately have been around 15% to 20%.

With respect, that might say something about your field and the extent to which the people who pay for your work feel they are getting value from it.  I don't know your field, but I would not simply assume that funding agencies are out to jerk you around.  I've met program managers (in passing, anyway) and I have great respect for them.  But the people who pay for research have limited funds and specific objectives.  The judgement is not simply about whether your science is good but also whether the proposal fits with the strategic objectives of the funding agencies.  Money, especially public money, does not grow on trees.

> But what amazes me most about this whole thing is how flaky the science direction of the entire country is.

Again: move to a different country!  Australia is always glad to gain new scientists.  So is Canada, my other country.

> I think science is losing a lot of its creative minds at the moment who are struggling to write successful proposals while working on their crazy original ideas on the side, because they know his crazy idea could never get funded.

Which is why scientists write proposals for research that is mostly finished.  That way we can get paid for the work we've already done and have a little slack to pursue some of those crazy ideas to at least some extent.

> At the moment, I’m settled on leaving the academic research career after my current post-doc term ends.

I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavours.  Your criticisms should be heard by anyone and everyone who is considering a scientific career path.  But I think my response should be heard too.

> But I do care about doing or at least trying to produce relevant science. That's mostly what I care about.

Relevant to whom?  I think that's a critical question that too few scientists ask themselves.  If you want to get paid, you have to deliver value to the people who pay you.
Actually I believe that science is *not* corporate ***enough***, in a way.

We have carried an evaluation system designed in the times when single individuals would often make very valuable contributions into an era when this is pretty much impossible (barring the once-in-a-generation super geniuses). We babble about "collaboration" and "networking", but scientific groups often are a collection of people individually doing their little projects, vaguely related to the others in the group, because this is the best way to get a paper with your name in first place which is all that you need to advance in your career.

We need a system that reliably creates large groups with clearly defined goals and division of labor, like in industry; and one that rewards the work of average-skilled workers in a more meaningful way, instead of pushing young people to pretend they'll be the next Richard Fenynman, realize they can't be after a few years, and then drop out to find a "real job" in the "real world".
Excellent post. You nailed so much. I saw most of this as well while I was getting my PhD, working at a national lab in the US for six years. Wish I could elaborate more but I don't have the time right now. Everyone considering going to grad school or into academia needs to read your post. I've quit academia because it really isn't a place I felt comfortable or excited to be most of the time. 
hey,

i am life sciences postdoc in the UK. same problems here, just to let you know!

dan
Graduated HS last year and I'm soon going into university, research has been my dream for a while. Should I just go for Engineering and give up on it..? Is it really so bad?
I'm a first year PhD student and I'm only just starting to see the ugly side of publishing. My PhD programme is pushing us to publish a paper by the end of our first year (ie in a month). My colleagues told me to submit an abstract to a conference so I can present a poster on frankly shitty results. My professor is losing patience with me because he wants me to show him some solid results asap.

I get that in the real world money drives a lot of research, but the pressure to 'just' get results is astounding. Truthfully, I can pull results out of thin air by adapting someone else's method to a slightly different model and by looking at similar parameters, but the end result is rarely anything impactful or interesting. OTOH, if I'm given breathing room to explore my own ideas and discuss them to great lengths with my peers, it could lead to something with more scientific value.

It's emotionally exhausting to feel cycnical about academia though, and I intend to finish my PhD within the 3.5 year funding period, so I'll play by the rules if I have to. But reading your post is just another reminder that the post - doc life looks rubbish.
I'm in engineering rather than physics, but my experience with academia at research universities in the U.S. was pretty similar to yours.  The largest difference I saw is that 'publish or perish' is actually a bit outdated; 'win federal grants or perish' would be more accurate.  Publishing matters mostly as a way to improve your chances of winning grants; otherwise it is secondary.  Everything else is tertiary.

The one time I was able to interview for a tenure-track position, I noticed that the first two questions most faculty asked me were 'what will be your source of funding?' and 'what problem will you study?', in either order.  They seemed to expect me to have a grant proposal in-hand.  I didn't have adequate answers to those questions, and (not suprisingly) I didn't get the position.

After reflecting on that experience and how my friends & colleagues who had obtained faculty positions seemed to constantly be under the gun to finish a grant proposal, I decided I didn't have the energy for it and left academia.  I make jewelry now!  One of my major disillusionments was that 'academic freedom' doesn't really mean much (unless you have tenure, at least).  Mostly you have the freedom to find a project that will get funded, otherwise you have the freedom to find a different job.
Disclaimer: not a researcher. 

However, I think it's your duty (or at least a would be good deed) to give **actionable suggestions**, or even actionable principles, on how science funding could be improved. Just criticism is not good enough, especially coming from someone as experienced as you are.

I mean, most likely just handing out money randomly (making it *literally* a lottery) -- since we can't fund everyone -- wouldn't be a better option. Also, when you use subjective-only assessments, people can get even more frustrated than in this system: I imagine it becomes even more of a game of politics, i.e. being likable with little regard for science. But I admit I don't have really solid experince and would like to know more.

But my conclusion is that we need at least a reasonable amount of objectivity -- that is, maximizing a certain metric with the data we have about the researcher that indicates how likely he is to produce good science (i.e. the "expected value" of his proposal). So the question would be, what are the best indicators of that? Are the current indicators too biased (amenable to gaming)?

---

I personally believe academia *should be* biased towards more pie-in-the-sky, high value (usually low probability of success) proposals. Industry is usually really keen on low-risk research -- "how we improve this process by a tiny amount", "we use this widely known method in this widely known field with predictable success", etc -- often driven straight to market. The only downside of that is industry isn't so keen on sharing results or publishing, which can hamper progress, and I believe academia actually derives a good source of income from secure research. So maybe a well thought out mix of the two, probably fine tuned by field and aided by lots of data and statistics, would be ideal?
The system is shit and full of problems. But at the end of the day, you have to decide whether you want to do science or not, and if so, where.
It isn't just in the scientific community... I see this phenomena everywhere, that people in every profession are required to be salesmen first and foremost, and the requirements of the job will always take a back seat to sales considerations.  This does not bode well for people who are lousy at sales, but otherwise excellent at their jobs.  
The original article, The Natural Selection of Bad Science, referenced in The Guardian is up on arXiv.org
Much of what you observe is a consequence of [chronic shortages in scientific funding](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-the-funding-decline-in-basic-research-20150428-column.html) in the U.S., particularly for basic research. This leads to risk aversion on the part of funding agencies and generations of scientists who have adapted to this environment in the manner you observe. In particular, you get a lot of  cookie-cutter faculty: experts in a narrow field, publishing (largely) incremental work and putting out students similarly narrowly trained. The Labs aren't any better with respect to risk aversion. 

We could solve this were one of the major political parties in the U.S. not hostile to funding basic research. As such, I don't expect to see this change anytime soon. 
To anyone who thinks these are new issues, look into the "Young Scientists Network" circa 1990's.  It was pre-WWW days, but we had email lists to communicate back then.

Basically, a bunch of unemployed dissatisfied young physicists organized and got a few of their members elected to the board of the American Physical Society.  (Positions that usually were filled by name-brand tenure physics professors.)

I'm not sure what, if anything, it changed.  But it happened back then. 

Here's an  pdf article from [Science in  1993](https://www.ganino.com/games/Science/science%20magazine%201993-1994/root/data/Science%201993-1994/pdf/1993_v262_n5130/p5130_0024.pdf).
There are great research scientists and there are great project scientists.

E.J. Corey is a great research scientist. The scraps of his papers spawn careers, but he is a fundamentally working well inside academia in a field which is mature and hard to get funding in and he only gets done what he gets done because he is so good that he won a nobel not for any one discovery but just for kicking ass for 40 years. His students work hours that E.R. Surgeons would consider cruel and unusual. 


Craig Ventner is one of the most brilliant project scientists of all time in that he saw this shit coming from a mile away and figured out how to apply an engineering "good enough" mindset and pursue industry money to form a hybrid research engine which has done a lot of cool shit. There are moral ambiguities to celera's research but he gets shit done.

The academic world you see is an unfortunate consequence of the harsh realities of modern decaying late stage capitalism. Bachelors degrees are more and more ubiquitous and financing is increasingly available because economic growth is modernly driven more by finance than production. This is because western culture has mostly figured out how to produce what it needs and that is a pittance compared to the spending power of the very rich. Educational loans are ostensibly a "bulletproof" investment and so money flows towards them and college prices increase even as states cuts funding for their colleges. 

Now, college is more expensive, less valuable, and more ubiquitous than it has ever been before. 30% of people over 25 have college degrees. The people best at school often go into STEM and discover that with their B.A. alone it is hard to get a degree that will pay off their student loans and let them live comfortably. Why? Because the U.S. has 6 million doctoral students over 33 million post secondary holding students. These people are then in an incredibly vulnerable position where they don't have the flexibility to take there B.A. and make something for themselves with it, they are in a lot of debt, and they follow the historical path out of that debt: more education.

This is a dead end. I once applied for a position where I was to control a vivarium, tracking and breeding mice for the purposes of using their retinal tissue for an experimental biosensor device. I was also supposed to develop software to control the laser optics used to test these devices and obtain a security clearance in order to handle the night vision and optics used to work in this lab space. The pay for that job? 10$ an hour. I lost out on the position to someone with about 4 years more school than me. What the fuck? 

These are a lot of tangential examples but my core point is this: the system you see is a symptom of a much larger problem: people have always tried to compete for wealth and resources. For about 80 years of the last century smart people figured out a way to monopolize part of the global economic pie which was to pursue higher education and develop rare skills which attracted a fair bit of money. Now that field is saturated, its primary benefit to society distorted, and only the very best of the best make any money. Just like textiles, smartphones, high frequency traders, security analysts, etc. etc. Academia is a mature field where the *smartest people in the world* compete for shit funding. Especially in safe, play it again research.

But people are always figuring out new hustles and new ways to exploit that pie. Software was easy picking once, harder now. Banking and advertising are big now but increasingly competetive. I'm sure given enough time those too will be saturated and hard to exploit. 

The moral is that to succeed, you have to take what you have now and realize that all the models of success which came before you are public knowledge, picked over by the vultures and copycats by now. Even finance is stagnating. The world economy is moving to a slow growth, high instability economic situtation with an aging skilled population. Infrastructure spending will focus on the new to the detriment of the old. And the same old constants: Medicine, shelter, clothing, food, and weapons will remain valuable forever because all living humans need them. Play the academic game while it serves you but don't forget it is a stepping off point for you to figure out your own cracks in the system to exploit so that you can do your pie in the sky research. 
I agree with you, even as an undergrad.

Who benefits from this system? This seems like a very inefficient way to distribute money, and I'm not sure if there is any incentive to keep it going.

In your opinion, what would help change this system?
Physics postdoc here (mathematical physics). 

The precarious nature of employment and systematic absurdities are not exclusive to academia. 

Indeed, it is more of a rule in present day capitalism. 

I invite you to discuss these issues in:

/r/socialism

A good friend of mine is finishing up his PhD in pure math, his wife graduated last semester in the same field. After struggling to find jobs in academia, both decided to go into the corporate world. That's two very intelligent and driven people with PhDs that would love to do research, but couldn't find a job. It's even hard to get a post doc (which is hardly a lucrative position). 

My one of my electrical engineering professors summed it up quite nicely. He said, Einstein wouldn't last long at (my school), because these days it's less about the quality of your work or how many papers you get published, and more about how much grant money you can bring the school. 

Incidentally, he also told me a story about all the drama, politics, and backstabbing that happened when he got a huge research grant. Everyone wanted a piece of the pie. Eventually someone was pushed out, they were disgruntled so they spilled the beans on what was going on. A high level administrator at the school was fired, and the funding was pulled. So no one got anything. 
I'm a math/stats guy working on a PhD in psychiatric epidemiology. It's interesting and saddening to see how common the problems OP described are in my field. Hype is everything...
That's quite sad. I'm doing an undergraduate degree in physics with the goal of going into reasearch but after reading this I don't know how feasible that is going to be. Is it worth it in the end? 
I work at a national lab. That system is also devoid of effective science. There is no incentive to take risks - rather the opposite. And without risks, there are no big rewards.
This exactly is the reason I decided not to go into research. I started my BS in Physics program thinking I could get a PhD and do some really cool, fulfilling research. Throughout my undergrad career though I slowly discovered just how much bullshit you have to deal with to be a research scientist these days. I remember having professors in my upper level classes come to class late, looking like they hadn't slept in days, and apologizing because they'd been up all night working on grant proposals. Add to that the fact that you actually have to teach classes on top of all that, (god forbid it's an intro level class filled with non-majors that don't give a shit.) and all the shit that comes with that. It just would've been too much for me.

So I decided to go the applied track and now I'm working on my masters in CS. Most of the professors I knew and worked with in undergrad were great, and really seemed to enjoy what they did, but I just don't think I could've done that for my career after learning all this.
Couldn't agree more! It feels almost taboo to talk about it (people very quickly make it about *you* instead of science...), so I'm very glad you did. I'm in life sciences rather than physics, but I've always though it wasn't as bad outside the squishy sciences. Sad to hear it's not so. I'm just finishing up my Msc in the Netherlands and am finding it considerably harder to find a job outside academia than I though - turns out academic experience doesn't count for much. I hope you find a nice place to do some proper science!

And don't feel bad about not having a solution. Getting people talking about the problem is more important right now.
I had a professor in college whose lab I worked in briefly.  The first thing he taught new students in the lab was how to sell a grant proposal and he strongly implied that the audience knows little and you want to incorporate the right buzzwords.  Very sad, though I don't know what a better system might be.
Seems like this system leaves no room for niche research at all. What about all the importance science that comes out of nowhere and could not have been predicted by some board of dudes? Are there any options for scientists looking to do inexpensive research over long periods of time? Like, if I wanted to conduct a long term and extensive study (10-20 years even) but only needed a small budget over that time period could a public funds program sustain that? Science might move slower that way but at least it would give more novel solutions a place to grow outside of individual wealth.

I honestly have not a clue. I am an English undergraduate with zero experience with academia.
Maths post-doc here. It's not just in the USA that this is a problem, it's essentially everywhere, though with variation.

The idea that you can say exactly what papers you will write and when is beyond stupid - I don't understand how anyone can have thought this was a sensible idea, because you don't need to be on the front line of research to realise it's impossible. I'd say it's even less possible in mathematics than in the sciences, because you often really have no idea what the truth is when you start researching a problem in mathematics, never mind what problems might crop up in discovering the truth. How, then, are you to say what the outcome of the entire project will be, never mind what papers you're going to write in the first year?

A common strategy in mathematics that you don't mention is to do the research for the next grant while being funded by the current one. Then you write the next grant application and say you will research what you've already done and write it up in the first 6 months. Of course if you then don't manage to complete something this strategy ceases to work.
Bravo. Thank you for writing this.   I was a research scientist in physical chemistry for over a decade in a soft money position. I left two years ago to go work in software development. I'm seriously underutilizing my skills but i needed the stability fit exactly the readings you point out.
Having been through much of what you're going through and eventually ending up in industry (Google), here is my perspective:

I agree that science has some systemic problems. That said, I don't believe those issues mostly have to do with deciding who gets money and where that money goes. Yes, funding committees will sometimes engage in groupthink that might exclude outside ideas, but they are committees of informed peers and are generally trying to do the right thing. Science is a speculative enterprise and we have to accept it is *very* difficult to make optimal funding decisions. Yes you could point to the odd brilliant thinker whose novel ideas got passed over, but we can also point to a hundred crackpots that are indistinguishable from a funding committee's perspective.

I believe the systemic problems in science today have mostly to do with the standards by which research is reviewed, published, and rewarded. Problems like:

1. Null results are generally considered unpublishable.
2. Scientists feel a strong pressure to publish "surprising" results.
3. There is generally little incentive or reward to reproduce another's published results.
4. Most scientists have little, if any, formal training in statistics. Independent reviews show that the majority of published articles have significant errors in methodology, and most reviewers are ill-equipped to catch these.
5. It is exceedingly rare for people to publish all of the data (and analysis code etc.) needed to replicate the key findings in a paper. It should be standard that when there is a graph or a simulation presented in a paper, that you publish the R code or Fortran code or whatever that produced that graph. Failing to do so made sense 30 years ago but in the era of the internet it is I believe borderline criminal if you are using taxpayer funds.

In biomedical research it has gotten to a point where a good fraction of published work simply can't be believed.

There is a completely separate set of issues at the personal level having to do with science as a career. As long as science relies heavily on grad students and postdocs to propel research, and as long as faculty turn out the number of PhDs they do, it will always be impossible for the majority of those young people to get good academic jobs. This is just math.

That said, if you can deprogram yourself a bit from what the academic culture is telling you (science is the only interesting career, you're a sellout if you leave academia, etc.), you'll realize that your life prospects are phenomenally good: Technical PhDs have the lowest unemployment rate of any category of people. Many companies *love* to hire people with quantitative critical thinking skills who can work independently. It's mostly just a matter of you the individual having an open mind about who you are, what you can do, and what is interesting out in the world.

For myself, I thought of science as a fun first career where I had a lot of freedom and had a great time. If I'd been lucky enough to hit on a big discovery during those years then perhaps I'd have been propelled into a faculty job. But that didn't happen and I'm not worried. I had fun and it's a huge world out there.

Welcome to the real world, where it's not all sunshine and roses, where the most successful people are not necessarily the people that meet your definition of the most skilled or productive.  Welcome to a world where you have to play politics to advance, not just focus on your "job".  I got news for you, this is life.  Look at any other field.  How many people go into politics with a sincere desire to change the world for the better, only to see people like Donald Trump pass them by?  How many people become teachers hoping to help kids only to become bitter and jaded by the entire system, and the students, after a few years?  Reality sucks sometimes, believe me I know.  What I have realized though, after spending many years in academia (in a physics lab no less), is that the people who are really skilled, are the ones who are able to navigate that system and produce good science.  There are people like that, I have met many of them and they are very impressive people.  I suspect it's the same in many other fields.  Obama was able to navigate a fractured and polarized political system and enact real change.  If he had taken your attitude he would have given up and dropped out entirely once he saw the flaws in the system.
 
You are giving up because the system isn't working the way you think it should.  That's ok, I completely understand why you feel that way and why you are making that decision, but the fact is if you really, truly wanted to do good science, you still could.  You could find ways to do the research you want to do within that system.  It might require sacrifice, it might require a lot of hard work, it might require doing a lot of stuff you don't like doing - schmoozing with people you don't like, working on projects you don't like, etc., maybe for many years.  If you really work at it though you could get to a point where you could work on things you want to do.  Maybe you could even enact some changes in the system itself.
 
Anyway that's my spiel.  No one ever said life is easy, it isn't.  Giving up because it's not handed to you on a silver platter is your choice.  It may well be the best choice for you, more power to you, but the fact is there are ways to achieve your goals within this system if you had the drive and determination to do it.
I used to want to become a scientist until I learned about this. I was very interested in doing work that would prove a lot of our current theories wrong (that is, after all, how science advances the quickest). But, clearly, this sort of structure does not allow for anyone like me. So I've settled on being an engineer, because in general nobody cares whether or not we do something according to the norm, just that it works better than the previous thing.
Very good [article](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/34/9384.full) on the same topic. 

>These days, scientists spend much of their time taking “professional selfies”—effectively spending more time announcing ideas than formulating them. 

....

>Academia has largely become a small-idea factory.
Duh?  I think it's pretty clear that plasma physics is a dying field, the situation isn't quite as bad in other fields but the same pressures still exist.

One thing I want to correct slightly is that they don't just care about number of papers, they also care about citations and quality of journals.
I did a BS in physics at an institution with a healthy plasma group. A great deal of that research happens at a facility and university with a restrictive patent policy (institutional ownership)
So plasma already is a hard field to get good long-term funding and then you add to it that corporate partners risk not actually getting rights out of viable research.
Your thoughts mirror mine. Fortunately I dropped out of grad school in the first two years of my PhD. Never looking back. 
> If I were a very smart and driven person, I would probably make it regardless of the system in place. But, I'm not.

This resonated with me and I dropped out of grad school because I work with and am friends these smart and driven people but I don't share their passion to delve into the nuances. However,  I do have a passion to make sure they have the highest quality data available for their research but that does not require me having a PhD. Luckily the few large-scale research projects I work on are well funded long-term because the PI is as good of a salesman as he is a scientist but I hear so much talk about soft-money from the junior scientists and other collaborators that to me it sounds like their primary concern more so than the science.
This is nearly 100% the reason I left grad school to start working in another field. I'd worked with many professors while in grad and undergrad, and the whole process for getting funded seemed too painful to subject myself to.
A related article, kind of about the same problem. 

http://www.socjobrumors.com/topic/the-slow-death-of-the-university-by-terry-eagleton-uk
I recognize this very well from how it works here in Sweden. I terminated my post graduate studies at a late stage, because I had directed my research towards novel ideas and long odds, and negative results can't be published so I figuratively perished. Now I am a technician in a pharmaceutical factory, boring work, but steady pay.
 This is exactly why I applied to a Ph.D program...then decided not to go back. I'm getting paid more, currently, to deal with a political system that I already understand. There was no reason to take a pay cut simply to study the field I love while being smashed down by assholes with corporate ability. 
Damn, that sucks. I know a few of the former students from my group finished their postdocs and transitioned into finance positions instead for similar reasons. It's pretty easy to get disillusioned by the system, especially when grant writing goes from "no, no, it's not for ITER" to "o, yes, yes, this is in support of ITER" for purely political reasons without the actual science changing. 
If we Really want results then we need bored scientists. Nothing, I repeat, Nothing is more productive than a bored scientist. 
Are you aware of any collusion between these grant reviewers and the grantees? Maybe a quid pro quo, if they give me a high score I'll help them on future proposals?
>The way grant review panels work is that they’re trying to judge a proposal basically on two things, impact on the field and likelihood of success. These two things are usually inversely proportional to each other.

So the problem is that they would be inversely proportional if everyone was starting from ground zero, but they're not.

Take two proposals, both with solid ideas for major impact.  Which do you pick?  The one most likely to actually work -- this entirely makes sense.  So, as a grant writer, how do you do this?  How do you make your work appear more likely to succeed?  Obvious -- do some of it first, so you can present the data that shows it will work, *because you've already done part of it*.

Not that this is particularly *good*, but I don't really see a better solution here.  We have more people that want to do science than we can are allocating money to pay for, which means everyone has to struggle to stay afloat rather than getting to do work.
RemindMe! 3 days
Question: You talk about it as being a problem 'in this country' a lot. What are they doing in other countries? Are some of their systems better? And how did do they accomplish that?
If you don't like a system where the guys who move up the chain are "corporate guys" rather than guys with real substance, then I'm afraid you're in for an even bigger surprise when you start working in industry. 

my wife is in a scientific field, works in a lab at a research university, and has a bachelor's degree in science. She's explained this exact problem to me so many times. Its a huge problem. Her boss did get tenure, but even after that, its still a struggle for grants basically for the rest of his career. Gotta keep writing to get those sweet, sweet grants. It turned her off getting her PHd, seeing how much stress was involved. 
[This was written almost 20 years ago](http://katz.fastmail.us/scientist.html) Hint: it was already way too corporate and hierarchical.
The culprit is [technology](http://simondon.ocular-witness.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/question_concerning_technology.pdf). 
Meh. Eventually the world runs out of low-hanging fruit, and if each person is required to publish 2 articles a year to keep a job or go to graduate school or whatever, those papers eventually become garbage if they want to pretend they add to the scientific literature. 

Perhaps all "breakthroughs" in theoretical physics over the past 25 years have all been mathematical nonsense.

The world is simply running out of jobs to do, that's all.
In our system science has become an arm of the capitalist profit system in the U.S. There is a joke in my department among us condensed matter people, how do you justify your grant? Quantum computers, high temp super conductivity or "it could make a device". 

Everything we study has to have some sort of justification along the lines of possibly making a device that someone can sell to consumers. Which by in large had left the HET department mostly grantless.

This is not to say that HET or fundamental physics doesn't get grants but the most successful, ie most funded, professors do device physics.

Our government exists for the benefit of the 1%, why are we surprised when the same tendency exists in government funding?

I could go on, but I'm on my phone at the DMV.
I completely agree with this post. I sort of had a glimmer when I was in grad school, but really did not understand the depth of the rot until I started my own postdoc. Run for your life, this structure will eventually collapse.
dude get out

why waste your time.  If you work in physics, when energy hits an upswing you could work on a reservoir team making 30k plus or more a month.

And then have the opportunity to invest that cash flow. Or you could waste your time in academic circle jerk... Or go private and make money.

go make $$$ and retire youngish while you still can.  Does alll that shit matter when you dead?  No matter what you contribute. NOPE none of it.  Make your money

do the things you love once you have seized your cash flow
Such a sad era.  Our scientists are more worried about funding and spend such a significant amount of time chasing it than exploring actual science.
Vault-Tec: not just satire anymore.
You will be hired by Lex Luthor to help him build his evil empire.
This all sounds like a typical system without a memory and feedback enabled. Because Normally when people make false claims and they get tested, and fail, they would get punished (in this case, funding and status get revoked). 

Now here this fails because: the problem never gets to see the light of day, or way outside the lifetime of the researcher (50 years from discovery to implementation), funders don't know if it's the problem or the scientist that failed, have more money that knowing what to do with it (can't say, oh there is no good projects in field X, so lets redirect money to field Y), grant giver are not qualified, or simply impossible,  to judge a grant proposal. 

So instead you get adhoc solutions like: number of citations on a paper (impact), number of paper published. All which affect future funding, since it's limited amount of funding you need to stand out to get the grants. 

So how do we punish people who over hype their results and future articles. Reputation of scientists with respect to not only completed research but difficulty of research. Where do you stop a research to recuperate costs, (most likely won't be possible because you rent labs with a schedule)?

Ideas?
Just wanted to say, I feel incredibly lucky getting a Post-doc position at a top 5 university with 0 published papers.
That's way too open ended. Could you clarify which country you want to study in, what level you want to study at (community college in your parents town, or MIT?), and what qualifications you already have/are working towards (have you just finished a masters and want to get a PhD, or are you applying to undergrad?). If you give us this information, people will be a lot more willing, and able, to help.

Edit- spelling
Edison and Tesla?  You couldn't think of anyone more current than that?
Hmm... needs more work:

Edison, Tesla (and Einstein?) walk into a bar.

Tesla (to waiter): It's quite hot in here. Can you switch on the AC please?

Edison: Not that topic again!
Edison, Tesla, and Einstein walk into a bar. Bartender says, "What is this, some kind of joke?"
Why does it have to be those two?

I like this one from /r/jokes:

>Tesla, Ford, and Edison were all standing on a stage, presenting their latest findings.

>Tesla strolled forward and announced that he had invented a brand new way to transmit energy through the air! The crowd clapped politely.

>Ford was next, and pulled the cover off a large engine. He had discovered a way to create horseless carriages! The crowd gasped and clapped louder.

>Edison took two steps to the left and threw up his arms to announce that he had invented a revolutionary new way to send electricity through the very air! The crowd went wild.
You know, it _might_ help if we knew why it was Einstein, Tesla and Edison that walk into a bar. You say your script requires it - so why does it? And are they already arguing when they walk in? Are they hostile? Exhausted? Looking to get drunk after something terrible happened?
> Do you think that it's the right choice?

Honestly, does it matter? I mean, what sort of thing could someone potentially tell you here that would change your mind about this program?
36 yrs old fellas here, started my undergrad.

It's a good choice, especially since you do programming! Plenty of opportunities, just never give up :D

Re employment in new sector is harder but still possible eve into our 50s, according to statistics. :D

Consider, for instance, Data scientist, pays huge.
This is a quite involved question obviously, requiring quite a bit more than high school physics for any sort of proper answer. I'm also sure it's been asked many times before, but I'll try to give one answer regardless. 

Basically, the issue is that when you try to treat general relativity as a quantum theory (you try to quantize it, as we say), you find that it has uncontrollable infinities, technical term is "non-renormalizable", as opposed to renormalizable, which are the theories that only have controllable infinites, i.e. the other forces. Exactly how and the technical reason why is a bit technical. So we can't get a reasonable quantum theory in the same way as we can for the other forces. At this level, it's just a mathematical fact, and it tells us that we have to look for some other theory of gravity. 


There are various conceptual reasons behind why gravity should be somehow different than the other forces as well. For example, gravity changes the "shape" of spacetime, meaning that in a quantum theory of gravity, spacetime itself can (and will) be in some quantum state. What does locality really mean in this case? You can't really define it, actually, and a theory of quantum gravity shouldn't have any local observables; something that we in the other theories consider fundamental. This gives a big hint that we need something a bit different. 

The most important reason is that all the other forces are quantized on top of a spacetime framework. Gravity IS the spacetime framework.
I wanted to chime into this thread since you haven't gotten that many responses, and there are a lot of ways to look at this. I also wanted to provide a more hand-wavey answer, but one which gives you a sense of the scale of the problem.


**The Energy Scale Viewpoint**

One important attribute of successful models is that their description of particle interactions varies with energy scale. This property is known as a [running coupling constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constant#Running_coupling). You can think of this as a fundamental input to calculations of particle interaction. One of the ways is to think about these theories (and their respective forces/fields) is in terms of a mathematical object called fixed points. Typically in literature you will hear the terms [IR (infrared) fixed point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_fixed_point) and [UV (ultraviolet) fixed point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_fixed_point). These are somewhat fancy mathematical concepts that mean:

* at lower and lower energies (resp. large distances), the theory behaves a certain way, but we select a particular energy scale at some low energy, and cutoff our calculations at the IR fixed point.

* at higher and higher energies (resp. short distances), the theory behaves some certain way, but we select a particular energy scale at some high energy, and cutoff our calculations at the UV fixed point.

In other words, in the Standard Model, you don't have an absolute description interactions over all possible energies; instead, we describe interactions as the evolve from high to low energies, or from low to high energies, and the model correctly describes what happens in the middle.

So where does this leave us? Well, our models of quantum physics describe how things behave down to a few orders of magnitude lighter than our lightest particles (electrons or neutrinos, depending on your preference). And they describe how things behave up to a few orders of magnitude heavier than our heaviest particle (the top quark, the W and Z bosons, or the Higgs, depending on preference). Beyond these regions, our models are not predictive. Or, you could try to make them be predictive and you'll essentially assert there is no other particle content outside of these energy scales.

In other words, our models describe how things behave:

* down to the length/energy scale corresponding to ~ 10^-4 eV.
* up to the length/energy scale corresponding to ~ 1 TeV (or 10^12 eV)

This is **very good** and rather amazing. It's almost 20 orders of magnitude!

However, inside these 20 orders of magnitude, gravity has almost no effect. We know of an energy scale where gravity ought to have the same relative strength of the other particle interactions: the Planck scale. To be technically correct, the first few orders of magnitude smaller (larger -- remember that higher energies / resp. shorter distances are not sensible) than the Planck scale.So where does that leave us? Well, our theory describes things:

* ~ 10^-4 eV - down to this energy scale
* ~ 10^12 eV (~ 1 TeV) - up to this energy scale
* ~ 10^28 eV (or ~ 10^16 TeV) gravity only becomes equally relevant (or equally powerful, if you like) here, near the Planck energy!

So while our very awesome and impressive theory covers almost 20 orders of magnitude, gravity is still 14-16 orders away from the highest energy (resp. shortest distance) we can describe.


**The Coupling Constant Viewpoint**

Another way to look at this problem is through [coupling constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constant). This has been a long response, so I don't think it's necessary to fully describe the significance of coupling constants and what they mean, and how they are used (they are used *everywhere* in quantum fields). But even without much detail, a simple glance at numerical values for the several forces can be descriptive:

*  [α*_QED_*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant) a.k.a. the fine structure constant, is famously (at low energy) approximately 1/137 ([but not *exactly*, Mr. Eddington!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant#Numerological_explanations)). For our purposes, 10^-2 will do.
*  [α*_EW_*](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/forces/couple.html) - the electroweak coupling constant is about 10^-6.
*  [α*_QCD_*](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/forces/couple.html) - the QCD coupling constant is about 1 (really, it's about 1/5, but it's order 1). The closeness of this constant to 1 has deep meaning, but I won't discuss it further unless asked.

OK, to summarize, we have (sorted this time):

* α*_QCD_* ~ 1
* α*_QED_* ~ 10^-2
* α*_EW_* ~ 10^-6

and where is gravity here?

* [α*_G_*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant) ~ 10^-43 s^2 m^-1 kg^-1

Not again! Gravitation is totally off the scale low. I mean, we're talking **40** orders of magnitude weaker than electromagnetism, and still **35** orders of magnitude weaker than our weakest force. Physically, this means if you placed two test particles (electrons) apart by a some distance, the electromagnetic (repulsive, in this case) effects would be [~40 orders of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_coupling_constant) stronger than the (attractive, in all cases) force of gravity!

If this situation weren't bad enough, there is one other glaring difference: the first three structure constants were [dimensionless physical constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_physical_constant). They are just numbers. These play very important roles in physics, and they are special because they lack a certain kind of dimension/unit bias that dimensional constants can have. In other words, we can expect that an alien would derive the same values for dimensionless constants, but we would have to correct for dimensional ones. But the gravitational constant is **not** dimensionless! This is a big deal, and is very much a stopping point for unification of forces. This fact has other implications, but I can't find a good reference for it now. [This might suffice](http://frankwilczek.com/Wilczek_Easy_Pieces/172_Unification_of_Couplings.pdf#) but I doubt it.

I hope this has been helpful. If anyone has errors/questions, please let me know so I can correct/amend my response.


Expanding on another comment, the biggest problem we have is that the two theories (Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity) are built on two different and completely incompatible schemes. Quantum Mechanics is called "Background Dependent". General Relativity is "Background Independent". Basically this means that when Quantum theories are formulated they start by arbitrarily defining a space-time background within which everything is measured. General Relativity, on the other hand, is background Independent because the objects interacting influence the space-time metric itself. In Quantum theory space-time is absolute and unchanging, while in Relativity space-time is dynamic and has some of it's basic properties set by the interacting objects. One of the more interesting ideas in physics is that space and time may not be fundamental entities in our universe, but are "Emergent Properties" defined by the interactions of the constituents of the universe. On the very forefront of investigation in this area is something that you should look up: The Amplituhedron.

https://www.wired.com/2013/12/amplituhedron-jewel-quantum-physics/
I haven't studied this in any great detail, but I think the basic idea is that gravity is so much weaker than the other forces on short scales. 
Think about the gravitational forces between two pieces of metal. It's pretty weak, and completely negligible in most (if not all) physical models. Now imagine if those pieces were magnetised - the attractive force between them would be much stronger. I don't know about the maths of it (first year undergrad here) but I believe that that's the main reason that it's been so difficult - because they behave so differently.

It is important to know that science like this is still important. Is horseflies are a big issue, we might be able to identify an easier solution to getting rid of them. As usual, small steps may look silly, but is still equally important.

>Summary

>1. We observed that the dragonfly species Sympetrum flaveolum, S. striolatum, S. sanguineum, S. meridionale and S. danae were attracted by polished black gravestones in a Hungarian cemetery.

>2. The insects showed the same behaviour as at water: (i) they perched persistently in the immediate vicinity of the chosen gravestones and defended their perch against other dragonflies; (ii) flying individuals repeatedly touched the horizontal surface of the shiny black tombstones with the ventral side of their body; (iii) pairs in tandem position frequently circled above black gravestones.

>3. Tombstones preferred by the dragonflies were in the open and had an area of at least 0.5 m2 with an almost horizontal, polished, black surface and with at least one perch in their immediate vicinity.

>4. Using imaging polarimetry, we found that the black gravestones, like smooth water surfaces, reflect highly and horizontally polarized light.

>5. In double-choice field experiments with various test surfaces, we showed that the dragonflies attracted to shiny black tombstones display positive polarotaxis and, under natural conditions, detect water by means of the horizontally polarized reflected light. This, and the reflection-polarization characteristics of black gravestones, explain why these dragonflies are attracted to black tombstones.

>6. If females attracted to the black gravestones oviposit on them, the latter constitute ecological traps for dragonflies that are not close to water.

> then it could be able to form black holes

Unlikely. It would need some process to accumulate on smaller scales, and there are upper limits on self-interaction of dark matter.

Black holes do not "care" about how they formed - no matter what went in, they have the same properties. Only charge, spin and overall energy are relevant, neglecting possible quantum effects. If dark matter could form black holes those would be identical to black holes which formed from regular matter.

> but the infalling matter would gather in a relatively "vacant" quantum well defined only by gravity. The perfect merge of quantum physics and general relativity. 

That does not make sense at all.
What are quantum states in gravity confinement? Of course, being in a black hole they are unobservable. 

However, it might be possible to find a deep, but not yet black, well in dark matter which confines particles in a finite space. When they excite and de-excite, what is the radiation spectrum? Can we observe such a radiation pattern? 

edit: removed a line

The idea is that the dark matter forms the gravity well but does not interact in any other way with normal matter. 
Gravity is an inertial force (can be made to disappear at any given point with a coordinate change) - just like the centrifugal, Coriolis, etc forces. Inertial forces are often called fictitious, but that's a very deceiving word. They are real forces.

The EM force (and the other SM forces) can be written in similar, but not identical language in terms of the curvature of a certain geometric object called a principal gauge bundle. Contrast with gravity in which the curvature is of the background spacetime itself.

In a certain sense, it's like charged particles "move" or "lie" in a certain "internal" space attached at any point in spacetime which can twist about as you change position in the latter - this twisting being the EM field.

In KK theory, this is literally because there is an actual compact extra dimension, sure, so that the EM force and 4D gravity are actually part of the 5D gravitational force, and the twisting is a literal curvature of the 5D spacetime. However, vanilla KK is certainly wrong in our Universe - it makes predictions that are not observed. As it stands now, it's not correct to talk about gauge forces (like EM) as being literally "the same" as gravity, if you want to stay faithful to what is accepted physics. KK and more serious modern derivatives are just  tantalizing possibilities for unifying gravity and gauge theories, but in more general theories. At low energy gravity and gauge theories split and act differently.
Gravity isn't fictitious, so no. Lemme explain.

In physics, we don't really care about *forces*, we care about interactions, because it's more general. An interaction is any coupling between two objects such that the evolution of one depends on the other. It can include "forces"—pushing things around—but also much more. For example, the color interaction (strong nuclear force) can transfer color between quarks and gluons. That's not a push!

Gravity is an interaction between any kind of object and spacetime. It's a coupling as real as electromagnetism.

Gravity pushes things around by warping spacetime as an intermediary, and this is dependent on your frame of reference. Electromagnetism pushes things around using the photon field as an intermediary, and this is dependent on your choice of gauge. How, exactly, are the two different?

The concept of "fictitious force" only applies at the more basic levels of physics, like Newton's laws and such. The term is irrelevant at the level of field theory.
Such beautiful patterns!

I wonder... would the cumulative force of the iron particles migrating along the magnetic field be capable of 'pushing' neutral particles that were also in suspension prior to perturbation by the field?
The paper is reported to have passed peer review over at PRL, but is not yet published.  Their pre-print is on arXiv.

Thanks to /u/jmdugan for first posting.
Huh?

They use rotation velocities for their acceleration estimates like everyone else. If other researchers use this method and find large differences in the dark matter fraction of different objects, how can they find the same relation in all their objects?
>The key is that near-infrared light emitted by stars is far more reliable than optical-light for converting light to mass, Lelli said.

So, before reviewing the actual paper, it appears that what set this relation apart from the Tully-Fisher relation, involving intrinsic luminosity, is that this relation is restricted to light of a particular wavelength. I'll be watching to see how well this holds up for other galaxies and cluster profiles.
I wonder what happens if one applies this model to the Bullet cluster.
Having read the paper I am not very comfortable with their statistical practices (it isn't at all Bayesian) or the way they present their conclusions.

On the statistics side, they say:
>Of the many resolved points along the rotation curves of these galaxies, we require a minimum precision of 10% in velocity. This retains 2693 data points out of 3149. Dropping this last requirement has no affect on the result; it merely increases the scatter as expected for less accurate data.

That really isn't what you are supposed to do. You can't just throw away data because the error bars aren't small enough for your liking. On top of that, plenty has been written about what to do about outliers or how to deal with messy data (see Hogg, Bovy & Lang's paper that should really be a requirement for anybody in this field).

In the discussion, they state that the possibility that these results "being the end product of galaxy formation" aren't satisfactory because cosmological simulations can't reproduce realistic galaxies is a bit overblown and really comes down to a matter of preference. The sims people have can't reproduce accurate galaxies, but one reason for that is a limitation of the hardware. If you want to simulate large scales (and capture things like lensing and clusters) then your particle size isn't small enough to resolve galaxy kinematics. If you want to simulate galaxy kinematics then you can't correctly account for the influences of large scale structure. Just last week there was a paper discussing how large scale structure affects how galaxies behave internally ([http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03388](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03388)). And on top of that, there are still plenty of astrophysical phenomena that aren't well understood at all that really probably do contribute to galaxy behavior. So dismissing this as a possible explanation is just way too hasty.

If PRL decides to publish then fine. They publish plenty of out-there papers, and at least it serves to spur discussion, but I wouldn't drink the MOND Kool-aid just yet.
Headline on every major news outlet tomorrow - "Scientists prove dark matter doesn't exist"
I have a hard time trusting the impartiality of authors with an address of "Euclid Ave" on matters of general relativity.

Just kidding! But seriously, thanks to everyone who has contributed in these comments -- it's a helpful discussion!
After skimming the paper, it appears that they rediscovered that MOND works (on galactic scales). They find a nice relation between dark matter and regular matter, which seems to require a explanation. However this explanation may well be, that dark matter interacts with regular matter via gravitation. 
I'm confused. Is this paper saying rotation curves of disk galaxies are predicted to be approximately flat (as they are) just by doing a more careful measurement of the ordinary matter in them than had been done in the 70's? I mean, if the researchers in the 70's had been able to find all the same matter these researchers do, would dark matter have ever been proposed? If the observed dynamics of galaxies is fully explained by the observable matter, then why doesn't the paper conclude dark matter is not real? Why would there need to be any modification of gravity or other explanation. What's left to explain?

It's time dependant. Your body has the ability to repair and mitigate effects of some radiation. We're exposed to it every day, and even more so if you fly or are at higher elevations. There is a lifetime limit on it if you're working with radioactive materials though, for liability reasons.
I'm looking for books that are readable and have more or less a casual tone but that will teach me something. Good examples would the Feynman lectures, or Zee's QFT and GR books, or Strogatz's *Nonlinear dynamics and chaos*. What are some other resources in the same vein?
I'm looking for a book about Fourier analysis with applications to physics. Does anyone have any recommendations?
Does anyone have any recommendations on Physics texts that are formulated from a mathematically rigorous point of view? Ideally I'm looking for things similar to Dr. Fredrich Schullers lectures and method of expositing. 
Having a lot of trouble in my upper level mechanics class. The text used in the class is John Taylor's book but I was wondering if anyone had any better/different recommemdations. Youtubers and Internet sources are also welcome
Any good optics book that talks about concentrator photovoltaic systems?

So if you disregard the leading contribution to entropy increase, you find that entropy doesn't increase anymore? I'm not sure this is a deep insight. It's also a complete non sequitur that the largest stores of entropy would have any effect on the local arrow of time, of course the local arrow of time would be associated with a local increase in entropy (when the local entropy flow is also accounted for)
The impression that I got of Muller from reading his many contributions on Quora is that he doesn't really understand general relativity. I wouldn't trust what he says about the nature of time if he thinks that it really does freeze at the event horizon of a black hole — a fallacy understood by anyone who has taken a class in GR.

Source: I study general relativity and how to test corrections to GR.
Isn't entropy more a "compass of time" instead of "arrow of time definer" anyway? I mean, You can use the milky way to define an absolute reference frame (up, down, left, right, etc) of the universe, setting preferred directions. But claiming directions "emerge" from the  Milky Way would seem absurd. Isn't time "just flowing", while we use local entropy to judge it's direction, so to speak?
To be honest, this argument is really stupid. It's not that amounts of entropy radiate magical arrow of time waves that make the world go in the right way. The microstate of the Universe itself has an asymmetry that is such that the thermodynamic limit (mostly) exists, the arrow of time manifests, and this descends from the boundary conditions on this state. Entropy is a tool to quantify this, not the actual reason.

If a certain piece of the Universe becomes isolated, this does not stop. The substate still has the same property.

The second part about spacetime and the "the metric tensor of the vacuum" (sorry, what?) is really, really weird.
I didn't realize that Richard Muller is active on Quora.  In fact, he is taking questions right now for a live answer session today (9/23/2016) at 11:00 am PDT.

 I like the idea that the future is being created instead of it existing and we are just moving into it.
Ok, so I thought I'd list some of the answers Muller gives at today's Quora Q&A session that especially pertain to his new ideas on Time.  I'll try to keep this list updated if any pertinent new answers occur. For the record, I have no association with Muller - I'm simply interested in what theories various physicists have on time.

Not a big deal. 

If you can give an estimate for the activity of the source and your distance from the source while you were outside the shielding, it's straightforward to calculate the dose you received.
If they use it in an undergrad lab, it's probably safe as long as you don't eat it or carry it in your pocket all day.
No.

They're not going to let undergrads handle sources that pose a serious risk for short exposures.

The added dose is quite likely less than the extra background dose you'd get if you lived at a higher elevation.
You're fine.  They don't let the undergrads play with important stuff, but there are radiation safety rules that universities have to be cautious of because minimizing exposure to radiation is a good thing.  

You probably get more exposure to radiation during a cross-country flight than you did in 10 seconds.
Also as far as long term safety working in rad labs goes, this dude (posted above) made it to 102yrs and they had minimal security and understanding then, so it's possible to escape healthy

Are the universal constants close to critical points or phase transitions in parameter space?  
That's of course a calculation with some model interaction.
So I just graduated with my Bachelors degree in Physics, was living in South Alabama and decided to make the move to Seattle. Any tips or suggestions for companies to apply to? I'll be making the move later today. 
To what extent can a math professor work with the physics department of a university? I'm thinking about going for a math Ph.D, but I wouldn't mind getting involved with cosmology as well.
I just started a Ph.D in a fairly reputable program (top 25 total, top 15 in HEP theory). I am really really interested in quantum gravity, but it's become apparent in my first month or so that the couple profs here that work in it are, well, big jerks, and don't seem to have had any success stories with their grad students entering academia, or even industry for that matter (i know this is common for theory but apparently one prof's advisee moved to a tent in South Africa taking 5+ postdocs and slowly losing their mind. This was one of his more promising students to try academia.). There are some phenomenologists here that seem decent, and at least good to have as advisers, but quantum gravity quite literally keeps me up at night. 

Feeling this massive (pardon the puns) gravitation towards QG, I want to do it with all my heart. I also want to have a non-hell grad school experience, and want to go into academia and possibly try to become a liberal arts college professor afterward (again, I know, a pipe dream in my subfield, but I could also see myself taking a job in big data or software and doing research as a hobby, really priority number one is being able to learn about and do QG) How feasible would it be to work with a phenomenologist and switch into more formal theory? How feasible would it be to transfer someplace with better QG work / actually decent advisers in QG?
I'm currently finishing my bachelor thesis (theoretical astrophysics, with basically baby-step-like numericsl relativity) and next month masters study begins. I really dig theoretical astrophysics and cosmology, so, what lectures should I consider? I thought about improving my mathematical ground game and attend courses in group theory, differential geomotry and topology at the math institute as a help for all that spacetime manifold stuff etc. Is that a good idea? Did Miss something that is very important?
Hey, I am an undergrad who has taken 2 courses in Quantum Mechanics over the past year, but my fundamentals in the subject are weak. I would like to study them again but retaking the course is not an option since the timings of the courses clash with my current compulsory courses. Is it viable to study some textbook and stick with it to the same effect? What book would you recommend? If not, what other ways can I get better?
Please people, help me.

So I'm torn between doing Maths and Physics. There's a program called "Physics and mathematics" which from what I saw, includes both important classes from both domains. (The main "roots" of both) I would be doing Real analysis, Classical mechanics, et all. The program is 3 years.

Did anyone do something of this sort ? In what did you specialize afterwards ? What job prospects can you seriously expect from this ? 
I will soon (finally) graduate with my Bachelor's degree in Applied Physics. I'm currently trying to figure out what direction to give to my Master's. I'm totally in love with quantum computing right now, but the field is in such an early stage that it seems I will likely have to do a PhD in order to make a career out of it, and I really don't think I'm cut out for a PhD. So I was thinking, I could also go into the semiconductor industry, but I'm not sure how doable that is with my degree. I *could* switch to EE (MSc), but that will delay me for another year (graduating this semester, bridging track is only given in fall semester). Any thoughts?
If TV has taught me anything, it's done by using a wall-sized cork board, photos, newpaper clippings, push pins and threads of red yarn.  There should also be a picture of a shadowy silhouetted figure with a big question mark in the middle.  Be sure to label everything with underlined, all caps, titles in marker, in case you forget what you were doing.
How do you ask a question so nebulous and general that no meaningful answer is possible?

Have you studied quantum field theory at the graduate level? If not that should be your first step.
This is equivalent to Lorentz violation.  Might give you something else to Google. A bunch of neutrino experiments have limits I believe. 
CPT violation is generally studied in high-precision collider or neutrino experiments. You probably need access to one of those to do a CPT experiment.

If you want to study it you need to learn some QFT and lots of experimental particle physics.
What do you mean by italian? Actual Italian citizens? People at Italian universities? Or Italian people at foreign universities? Italy sure had its share of famous physicists, but that doesn't say anything about the current quality of their institutions. In fact, people at my university are still making fun of italy for their faster than light neutrinos. Also, if you throw enough money at it, anything can somehow compete with MIT. But if you can't convince politics to fund it you're never gonna make it into the higher rankings.
I mean, there are really no world class italian universities, but there is certainly a very long list of italian physicists who have been extremely successful. So "italian physics" in italy is not exactly thriving.
Great education, but horribly underfunded laboratories. Italian experimental physicists are very successful - outside Italy.
>I think that with more money it could compete with MIT

isn't that obvious? unless you have some underlying "racial" ideas that make you think this isn't obvious and that somehow isn't a given because "it's italy", and not say, america or another country.

very questionable post.
If you know at what height the centre of mass of the Jeep is found and the width of the car measured between the outer sides of the wheels, it can be calculated how much energy is required to topple the car (essentially, you need to find the angle at which the car needs to be held to have it fall on its side). I'r have to draw the situation to derive this exactly.
The kinetic energy in sideways direction needs to be at least this amount. Kinetic energy equates to speed with E=(1/2)mv^2, and this speed is the component in sideways direction. To know the incident speed, you need to divide the sideways speed component by the sine of the incoming angle.

You also mentioned your car spinned 720 degrees on its side. But this is less useful, as the friction of the car on the road surface would have to be known. There are probably not that many studies on the friction coefficient of the side of a Jeep against asphalt. Also, given the point of impact is quite close to the centre of the car the torque cannot be determined very precisely.
The problem with doing this is that even though you gave a lot of information we are missing some very critical details.  First, the hyundai could have acted as a wedge, allowing your Jeep to put some of its own kinetic energy into flipping itself.  Also, most of the energy in a car crash actually goes into deforming the car (the entire point of crumple zones) so we would have to know how much went into crushing the front of the Hyundai and the side of your car (plus all the energy lost from the usual processes like sound, heat, etc).  We can do some very rough approximations, but they will be rough and you would be surprised how comparatively little energy it takes to flip a car.

The center of mass of your car would need to be lifted over the tires in order to flip.  Looking up some rough values of 1.9 m width and 1.83 m height and assuming that mass was evenly distributed through the car (bad assumption but it's back of the envelope math), we find that the center of mass is roughly at 0.9 meters high.  Then we find the height it would have to be at over the tires if the car was balancing on two wheels using some basic trig, this gives us a height of ~1.3 meters off the ground.  Taking the mass of the jeep and just calculating the difference in potential energy mean that 10.7 kJ of energy were put into your car to lift it to just barely at the tipping point.  This corresponds to the amount of energy carried by a hyundai going 7 miles an hour.  This would be the absolute minimum for a crash that was 100% efficient at transferring energy and at a right angle to your car.  Accounting for a 60 degree angle only bumps it up to about 8 miles an hour.

Unless we had a lot more detail this sounds like we would need someone who specialized in accident reconstruction and crash analysis who might know how much energy various things would eat up in a collision.
That sounds like staight out of a science fictiion manual
The modeling/collective-electron-response theory basically rips off [this prior work](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.045003), which wasn't cited in their article. (This is completely unsurprising from this group, who like to pretend nobody else in the field exists.)
They are amazing. He will put a little more emphasis on the math and give you a more theoretical intuition, whereas Lewin will do demonstrations and give a good physical intuition. Follow both if you can. I found Shankar to be exceptionally clear. And he is funny as hell
I've never gone through his online lectures as you're intending to, but Shankar's quantum mechanics textbook is great. As others have noted, it's more theoretical in base, but it's good.

They're older, and a touch outdated, but Feynman's lectures (3 textbooks, available online too) are excellent. There's a clarity in his explanations that is unmatched.
Shankar also has a [nice math book](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Training-Mathematics-Fitness-Students/dp/0306450364/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474437251&sr=8-1&keywords=shankar+math) to go along with his course.  It can be found online...
I'm taking physics 1 right now and my professor really likes Dr Shankar. He teaches exactly what we're learning but at a faster pace, and the way he describes concepts is very clear. I have to go back and forth a lot to fully comprehend everything though. Also haven't attempted his practice problems
I watched them during my first and second year and thought they were absolutely brilliant. Pretty easy going, you just soak up a lot of useful insight.
His lecture where he derives Maxwell's equations, start-to-finish, is still the best and most clear video I've ever seen of such anywhere.

The theory is written as a tensor equation.

If you want more math, here are some lectures by Alexander Maloney.

With recorded lectures you can control your own pace, so you can switch back and forth between math and physics as needed.
Linear algebra, differential equations, a little vector calc won't hurt, and some differential geometry.
Differential geometry.

EDIT:  I like

Barrett O'Neill: *Semi-Riemannian Geometry: With Applications to
Relativity*

But it's a pure math book.  It's probably a bit overkill if you want to
do physical examples as soon as possible.  But still a very good book if
you want to get a deeper understanding afterwards.

And the chapter about multilinear algebra is very good to avoid the
typical confusions about tensors.  Seeing tensors as multilinear maps
instead of “some thing with lots of indices” makes everything much
clearer.

Don't forget the *physics* prerequisite is a good foundation of analytical mechanics.
It's amazing how one word difference can change how difficult something is: from SR to GR. 

SR is easily taught in first year main physics course at university. GR requires either an amazing 4th year/masters or just a set of courses for PhD students. This is from an Australian perspective. YMMV. 

Would love to know other people's trajectory.

It's succinct and easily understandable; the whole book is only about 120 pages. 
I know it's not the same as *mastering* the theory of gravitation, but I got a B in general relativity at my university last year and my only math requirements were diff. eq. and linear algebra.

The later stuff used a bit of topology, but not enough to need to know, and our professor did a great job with filling us in with what we needed to know.
There is a free course on GR at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/general-relativity), which started just last week. Check out the first few videos to see if it is something you can handle.

Did you launch the reel and hold the loose end, or tie the loose end to the projectile and have the reel on a spindle?
This is the kind of demonstration that gets bored highschool students interested in physics for the rest of their lives.

Also, kudos for saying that "per second squared" is a terrible way to put the concept.  It's intimidating to put it that way and you explained the core principle quite well.
Compressed air in pvc pipe is [no bueno](https://www.osha.gov/dts/hib/hib_data/hib19880520.html).  That white scd 40 pipe is only good for 150 psi when new and at normal temps.  If it gets cold and old, it goes boom and sends plastic shards at high speed into squishy objects.

Steel pipe isn't much more difficult to work with than plastic pipe, and it won't blow apart at 80 psi.

Other than that, very cool video. = )  
I liked steps 1 and 2 where we attached some VCR tape to a projectile, shot it, and recorded the motion. But I was disappointed we didn't get steps 3 and 4 where we use the video to compute the initial velocity of the projectile, calculate the expected parabolic trajectory, and then compare our trajectory to the theoretical model.
[deleted]
Cool video! I started to think about how much the "coupling" of the tape will affect the shape. One could see that the parabola shape changed over time. Sounds like a great exam problem for theoretical physics ;-)

My first recommendation would probably be that exact book; I think it's pretty good and "basic" compared to many math books on the subject. The first half of [these lecture notes](http://www.physics.uu.se/digitalAssets/405/405910_3notes_v3_0.pdf) are also a good introduction to this stuff; he goes through the relevant concepts pretty quickly and then explains the classification of simple Lie algebras. These [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TELw-ds-Upk) are also excellent but he perhaps goes a tad too quick. 


If you want to see more the connection to particle physics I guess you need a particle physics and/or QFT book as well. I don't really have any recommendation for a book about particle physics, some people like Griffiths, but I haven't really used it, and I didn't like the books we used in the course I took. For QFT (and personally I don't think particle physics makes much sense unless you know the basics of QFT), Peskin and Schroeder is the standard book and it's pretty good. Srednicki is a bit more modern and there is a free pdf floating around somewhere iirc. 
"physics from symmetry" by schwictenberg was written for you! Starts off with teaching you basics about groups and then brings in physics. Highly recommend, given that you have a bachelor in physics and some other books in this field are terrible to start with..
There are many good textbooks on this.  My two favourites are:

* Sternberg, *Group Theory and Physics* (1994, CUP)

* Tung, *Group Theory in Physics* (1985, World Scientific)

The absolute classic is Weyl's *Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics* (1931, Dover), which, now being on Dover, is really cheap.  But the two above are much clearer -- at least for pedestrians like me!
I don't like H. Georgi's book for many reasons, but it should absolutely be readable and understandable. At least the first few chapters are fairly well written.
I recommend Ramond's book on group theory. It's not focused on particle physics in particular, but I found it very comprehensible and well-written.

These are so perfect. I don't hate dogs, but my undergrad experience feels lacking now.
I started physics the year that the education department directed that physics be made more relevant for girls.  That year I did calculations on shopping trollies crashing into cars in car parks, the behaviour of balls on a Netball court, throwing a wedding ring off a cliff, and whether or not the wedding ring would hit the ground at the same time as the ex husband :)
Like my teacher, except he fires students out of cannons and off cliffs.

I've noticed a number of people without physics knowledge who seem to think that one can make a perpetual motion device using magnets and Newtonian physics. It seems intuitive that this is not possible due to conservation of energy, but is there a formal proof that I can point to when someone brings it up?
I have a constant acceleration field (value g).

I put a mass M in that acceleration field. It accelerates with g. (obviously)

Reverse time: I put a mass M in that acceleration field and it hovers (from my field of view). How much energy does it use?

Of course you can only say something about energy if I specify the time (t) it hovers. So let's rephrase:

I put a mass M in that acceleration field and it hovers. How much power is required to do so? 

My idea is that this power must be constant (depending on M and g of course) because I feel like it should take double the energy for the mass to hover for 10 seconds than it takes for the mass to hover for 5 seconds.

That field is just there, no other mass to cause it. That would be too easy as you could just but a block between the two masses. Of course this is strictly theoretical but it feels like it must be solvable to me. However I just can't figure out how to solve it.
Is there much known about a lower limit on black hole mass, radius, or some other parameter?
Is it true we still don't have a computer simulation of a supernova that explains why the star explodes? I was watching an older documentary and it said our models show the stars should just collapse. We know from observation that they do in fact go nova, but what do we currently know about the mechanism of how that happens?
Why is the surface of my coffee behaving discontinuishly?
I took the lid off my coffee to let it cool. On the surface I saw a shimmering pattern of eddies and swirls which I took to be molten microglobules of cream that had gathered on the surface. 
What was strange is that the movement of the patterns took the form of sudden, rapid events, at irregular intervals. Like, a line would quickly sweep along a centimeter and then abruptly stop, or a circle would suddenly explode outward and then just as suddenly halt. 
Are there conditions where a fluid would behave this way? Or are there microscopic particles landing in my coffee and precipitating these events?
How do reflections work?

Could someone explain in terms of surface roughness, viewing angle, anisotropic and fresnel reflections, reflections on semi-transparent surfaces?
I've been through some military training and I was taught that bullets rise then fall. I told this to my physics teacher and he didn't think it was true and there was no basis for this. Looked up the trajectory and it was indeed a parabola. My question is why? The barrel it's self is straight. Is there a good physic answer to this question so I can sound smart next class?
How viable is an BS Engineering Physics degree straight out of college? I love physics but dont want to do research or any PhD's. I wanted to do something involving physics but have some practicality. Anyone out there with this degree working within the field?

Quantum mechanics assumes that electrons behave like quantum objects, end of story. In certain situations, and only in those lucky situations, can you say that those quantum objects look kind of like classical waves or particles. But that's an interpretation that you're adding on.
What do you mean by "the quantum model?"
QFT states all particles are excitations in their respective fields. To put it simply, we see an electron as a disturbance in the electron field. Wave-particle duality comes into play with how electrons move through the field. Electrons do not have a known location until it is observed (meaning interacting with another particle). The famed double slit experienents physically shows a wave interference pattern, even with a single electron - it interferes with itself. So a probability wave is used to describe this phenomenon but it's just a way to say we cannot know for certain where the election is in the field until a photon or something interacts with it - then its location is certain.  On the flip side it also has qualities of particles. Electron scattering microscopes depends on electrons interacting like a particle. Hope this helps. So you can simply say it has the qualities of both - hence wave particle duality.

She was a great speaker and very cheerful person! It's very sad she died so young
No!
way to young ... RIP!
Fuck man, I worked at JILA a little over a year ago and she always seemed like a really nice person :( Never even knew she was sick
Very sad. She was a fantastic physicist and, from everything I've heard, a wonderful human being.
I thought I saw her name on a list of Nobel prize predictions for this year. I know they don't give it posthumously though.
Was her early death somehow related to her work?
I can't understand what this picture is trying to say.....
No, I'm afraid the metaphor doesn't make any sense.

Mass is not something that can be moved through.  Also "space (distance) over time" is called velocity.  It doesn't make sense for speed to "move through" anything.
It's an example of what happens when a body of mass move through space. space acts like a stretchy fabric. morphing gravity around it as it moves through space.

From what I can gather this is imagining 2 dimensional mass in 1 dimensional space.
Your own consciousness just affected both your reality and mine, because you posted this question.
That's not really a physics question. Physics doesn't say anything about our consciousness. Maybe a philosophy question? The idea sounds kind of absurd to me, but I'm not well-versed in philosophy.
Here's why this question is meaningless:

define "consciousness" in an absolute framework. You can't, because it's a subjective phenomenon by definition. 

Also you are begging the question by implying consciousness and "reality" could be two distinct, non-overlapping phenomenon. Obviously this is false because any definition of "consciousness" is comprised of, and impacted by, reality at all times (whether stimulus is symbolic or not). 
In one sense, yes. Quantum Mechanics does not predict telekinesis. This line of thought usually stems from a misunderstanding of what the word "observation" means in Quantum Mechanics.

In another sense, no. Random firing of neurons gives us a dream, which becomes a plan. The brain moves the hand to move a stone that might remain in place for thousands of years. 
Buddhist guy who is studying Physics in Uni, at the age of 36.
Your question is exactly what I am planning to prove, in , maybe, 10-20 years.

The point is, I had thousands of proof, experiences and people giving real-actual life experience, that what you are asking is 100% positive and true.

People healing from cancer, Things happening only because someone really wanted, personally it I live it on a daily basis.

And no, I't not self belief bullshit.
 Reality, especially one's life it is carved mainly by the invisible, attitude and partly by it actions.

The same action in a similar situation can have different results, Chaos and Quantum physics agree with that.

Unfortunately I don't have enough knowledge to prove it, yet...

So far I can only theorize, stupidly, without enough ground, that Quanta and quarks (the smallest part of our reality), might be affected by the electric field in the human brain and this, happens even in long term.

Again just wild theories ;)

:D
As someone fairly well versed in philosophy and physics, no. This comes a deep misunderstanding of quantum mechanics. Many people understand that QM means the universe cannot be deterministic, but then assume that leaves only the option of free will existing, which means that consciousness shapes reality. The truth, however, is that the universe is "indeterministic", and doesn't care one bit about you. Hell, it doesn't even recognize you as being a discrete thing - you're just a bunch of particles thrown together to it.
If physics has learned anything in the past hundred years, it's that sometimes things aren't like you thought they would be. So far we've found absolutely nothing that suggests this could be possible, and it doesn't make any sense within our current theories. But saying that the idea is absurd in itself is meaningless. A lot of people considered quantum mechanics to be absurd, and yet here we are.
There is no known mechanism in our physical universe that would turn it into The Matrix. 
Ideas are useless if you can't prove anything -  the scientific model is based on empirical evidence. What you have shared is unfalsifiable and therefore not science.

I'll be the first to acknowledge that it's likely very silly and I apologize for wasting your time. That being said it would be interesting if there was a link between matter, antimatter, and how we experience time's arrow.
Awesome idea dog may not work but it's great to just put it out there never stop :) 
I don't actually believe that this is such a terrible idea. Especially if you extend your mind beyond the reaches of what the books will teach you. There is tried and tested knowledge of science and the capabilities of the mind far beyond what the common people are allowed to know, and if you consider these things to be true then you're crazy, naturally, right? Sarcasm of course. But it is true in terms of how others perceive you when you believe in things beyond the norm, so if by some chance you are very right,  those that know you are may try to prove you very wrong. 
In the case of special relativity I think Wikipedia has [a marvelous section in the article "History of special relativity"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_special_relativity#Early_reception), and the [article about criticism of the theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_theory_of_relativity), both, special and general, is also very recommendable. Note that criticism against Einstein himself (because he was a jew) was so strong in parts of the german physics community that after the Nazis came into power, the so called ["Deutsche Physik"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Physik) (_german physics_) was imposed to cleanse academia of his "jewish theory".
Here is a very interesting article about a famous debate between the eminent philosopher Henri Bergson and Albert Einstein. Bergson's points apparently had an influence on the 1921 Nobel committee such that it awarded Einstein the prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect rather than for relativity.

I'm interested in how they will make orbital adjustments with the free floating cubes on board. Do the cubes get periodically "locked down"?
/u/Rawr_I_am_a_Beer already pointed out that the oposite of a black hole is a white hole, but a white hole requires negative mass. What you are looking for is a massless particle. Massless particles are not quite as exotic as black holes and we come into contact with them all the time. One example of a massless particle is the photon, which is the particle that carries the electromagnetic force (and also the particle that carries light, because light is a special case of the electromagnetic force). Massless particles have the peculiar property that they always move at the speed of light, in any reference frame.  They physically cannot stand still, ever. You cannot even try to think of a reference frame in which they stand still because the normal laws of movement and causality break down if you try to do that.
There's no empirical evidence whatsoever to prove that black holes actually tear a hole through space-time, that idea was merely a hypothesis. Our current understanding of black holes doesn't disprove that hypothesis, but it does point towards an other direction, as we see it, black holes don't rip space-time, they just cause an immense disturbance in it, where the huge gravitational force causes time to slow down. The objects stuck in it don't simply disappear and appear elsewhere (as if the black hole was an entrance to a wormhole), the information isn't lost, it's merely stuck inside the black hole until it gets dissipated as [Hawking Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation).

Edit: Additionally, it's not very accurate to talk about negative weight, you should instead say negative mass because weight refers to the resultant force in a body caused by gravity. See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_versus_weight) for a better clarification.
It's theorized to be a [white hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hole) which if I remember correctly shoots out matter instead of sucking it in. Also, if I remember correctly, there's theories that state our universe was formed from a white hole, though I have only ever seen one article about it.

Huh, very interesting, I never would have guessed that pure water ice could produce such strong emission under UV excitation. A quickly literature search shows that there has been a bit of work in trying to identify the origin of the luminescence, but there is still some uncertainty. [This review paper](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar990145e) suggests that the blue emission band around 420nm that you see is due to a forbidden transition of the OH radical. They claim that while this state is generally unstable, it might hang around longer when the hydroxide radical is bound in a matrix of ice. 
The usual mechanism of forbidden spin transition phosphorescence does not seem relevant, nor does the enhanced phosphorescence of organic materials at cryogenic temperatures due to suppressed non-radiative collisional losses depopulating the excited state. I am at a loss to explain this very surprising phenomenon in pure water. Is it chemiluminescence via the radiolytic creation of some high energy free radicals?
"Pure" water? I'm assuming that's a little poetic license in the title.
Couldn't this just be due to fluorine in the tap water?  After all, most places mix in fluorine to reduce tooth decay.
Did you seriously, actually, own your own, just discover a NEW property of WATER? What?!?!?
Ice laser anyone?
All the poster would have to do is mix in some aromatic hydrocarbons and it's relatively trivial to make water fluoresce. Could use a spray bottle to spread it around a bit to make the other doodads glow too.

What are you covering?
Which book are you using? 

There's a huge variety of good, free online sources on classical mechanics that you can look at. I would recommend the [lectures by Leo Susskind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApUFtLCrU90 ) as a good way to get some overview/intuition. You can also check out the [MIT OpenCourseware] (http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/), they have both lecture notes to read and I think videos for some of their courses. 

Generally though the way to learn physics (or math) is to solve problems, until you really understand what you're doing. Just reading or watching lectures isn't good enough. So that would be my suggestion for how to approach the book: skim the chapter, note the key concepts and formulas, no need to read in detail if the book is verbose. And then solve some exercises.  
What university are you attending?
A long-lived SUSY particles would not answer nearly every question about our cosmos. It would answer the question "is supersymmetry realized", but that leads to even more follow-up questions about the details of SUSY. Particles as discussed in the article are also not dark matter candidates because they decay too fast.

ATLAS and CMS have searches for those particles already - they can decay in the detector, or at least they can be detected indirectly via the momentum balance: if an invisible particle escapes, the momentum in the detector is unbalanced.
Interesting read. 

In the 2nd to last paragraph, it's said that inert long-lived particles could be related to dark matter. Doesn't this refer to the [theoretical Hidden Valley work](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261) that Matt Strassler and Kathryn Zurek wrote about back in 2006 and referred to in [recent Phys.org article *Hunting for dark matter's 'Hidden Valley'*](http://phys.org/news/2016-05-dark-hidden-valley.html)?
Music too loud to think can help. Nothing in particular, whatever you are into. However I woild recommend songs/albums you have heard before, as novelty isn't great for sleeping.
Read fiction.

If you're as obsessive with thing's as I can be, then your brain most likely won't "switch off" for bed with anything short of getting stoned, which isn't something I would recommend (Nothing wrong with it if that's your thing, but if your goal is to be productive then it's probably not).

You can change the channel though. I find reading a fiction book gives me something specific to focus on that requires little mental effort from me, which then allows me tune out everything else and relax enough to fall asleep.
smoke a doobie dude
No specific advice but I had the same, although not in grad school yet. This has been a huge problem for me during my undergrad research. I was so absorbed by thinking about it and working on it at evenings, I just automatically answered texts and told people I couldn't come out. In retrospect I wasn't happy in that period. It was a really great experience physics-wise, but it takes more than that to enjoy life in general. This combined with all the classes made for a very tough semester. When finished it was a bit like waking up from a dream. I am content with the work I have done, but I wouldn't do it again the same way. I'd be definitely willing to stretch it out over one or two more months and have a more balanced life. I know I make it sound very dramatic, the physics wasn't that impressive - just a lot of tedious calculations. 

As a long-time practitioner of TM, I am completely biased. :-) But Transcendental Meditation is a great way to deeply rest and rejuvenate the mind.

Downvoted again. It's fine in the beginning, but as the series goes on, the author slips in more and more material about his own 'theory of everything'. Everything past the start of quantum mechanics belongs in a homeopathy seminar, not a physics textbook.
Unfortunately I can't really recommend any definitively good physics texts for High school level. I know a decent  beginning book I used for physics is Physics For Engineers and Scientists by Ohanian & Markert. This a good HS level introduction to Mechanics and E&M, but is not great.

For some further advanced topics:

Classical Mechanics, By John R Taylor 
Classical Dynamics by Thornton and Marion.

Waves and Oscillations by Fitzpatrick, or King (king if you're comfortable with complex, Fitz if u want a purely trigonometric view of wave interaction)

Electrodynamics by Griffiths

And introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths
To get a good idea of WHY we need QM watch some beginning lectures of Feynman or read his lecture series.

A first course in general Relativity by Schutz if you're feeling adventurous.

These are all undergraduate texts by the way, so they are friendly in their treatment of mathematical analysis and proofs (which really means the proofs are hand wavey and theorems are typically taken to be true without much motivation)
For me, it never feels that way. To stick with your "pieces falling in place" analogy, I would say physical sciences are like an infinite game of Tetris. As soon as you gain a feeling of understanding some aspect of a subject, you realize that you now have created as many questions as you've answered, and new information is always incoming for you to assimilate into your worldview. Some might say that there is an ultimate goal of complete knowledge, but I reject this view. We must always be skeptical of what we "know." 
After learning that most physical laws are derived through some kind of minimization principle, whether it be minimizing the action or minimizing the energy. 
The separate physics classes (Mechanics, Thermo, E&M, QM, etc) all finally fit together for me during an undergraduate class on the physics of stars. A class which, incidentally, wasn't actually offered by the physics department.
Statistical mechanics sort of pulled it all together for me.
I minored in Physics.  It never really fell into place into some way that I could ever be professional at it, although I do have one memory from my Advanced Class (Quantum, energy wells, all that stuff), where I had gotten through a point in the semester and I was a bit overwhelmed.  Well what I did was find a big comfy chair and literally re-read my ENTIRE physics book from beginning to end, all the examples, all the parts I wasn't told to read, etc.  It took all day. I didn't try to work on any problems, just read. And just in one continuous sitting connecting everything, thinking about everything with no pressure to do any particular assignment (although looking at the problems), many lights went on and I was then excelling.  I wish I had done it earlier in other classes.
Once you get very comfortable with Hamiltonians and the Legendre Transformation, physics starts feeling more cohesive.
When I first heard this?

I'm a senior undergrad right now, and I'm starting to reach the Singularity- all of my classes are starting to blend into each other. But I don't think that happens on too grand of a scale. Focusing on the couple of overlaps makes more sense. 
I don't know that this ever happens - where everything absolutely meshes together perfectly. And that makes perfect sense, because these theories contradict each other. Your understanding of Classical EM will never mesh with your understanding of Quantum Mechanics, because Classical EM is wrong.

I imagine you have a decently meshed understanding of classical mechanics and classical EM, because these make sense on a human, intuitive level. With regard to Quantum Mechanics, it takes a long time to wrap your head around the stuff. I didn't feel like I really understood what was going on until I had taken a course in complex analysis and a course in linear algebra. Mathematical analysis really helped me to regard quantum as an abstract mathematical framework, rather than endlessly trying to imagine infinite-dimensional quantum states visually in my head. They're just numbers. 

I think cosmologists and QFT theorists probably are the closest to having a totally meshed concept of physics in their heads. But even then, they would probably never say it all makes sense, or else they wouldn't have a job.

Edit: Going off of what someone said below - the only thing all of the fields have in common is mathematics. Once you really understand all the math, then you will be able to draw analogies between the different fields and make some sense of them as a whole.
some pieces felt into place as i did some graduated courses.
GR, QFT2 and SUSY and now QI, when you see it all together connected.

the problem of this module based system is, that its indeed all scattered and feels unconnected, but its all connected and all needed to understand something in physics.

so for something you could need statistics, quantum and a bit of electrodynamics and then a bit of mathematical physics and boom you got it.

When does it stop?
When I was introduced to string theory.

Gives a completely different, fresh and honest picture of all the bizarre constructions of QFT, renormalization, special/general relativity, quantum mechanics... not really sure how to explain it but it makes everything look familiar.
Once I find a way to relate a physics concept to something I already think is interesting, it becomes a lot easier to understand.  If I can't, then it's a lot harder.  I suspect that it's that way for a lot of people whether they realize it or not.  The problem is that it's easier to throw information at people and hope something sticks than it is to make them want to learn more of their own accord.  If you're worried about "the pieces not coming together" try and think of ways that the material could be relatable to you or at least something that you're interested in and explore.
I found they fell into place by the end of each year. Certainly with the core modules this was so, but, the option modules were a little more tangential. The more reading around the topics you do, the more connections you'll find. But that is more to do with the nature of Physics  than anything else.
This could be arrogance on my part, but I feel like I've got a good handle on the state of research / the limits of knowledge from a wide variety of fields. I would ascribe this to conversations with my professors, some seminar classes, but mostly Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a fantastic tool for gaining surface-level understandings of a wide variety of fields. Simply being familiar with the names and subjects dealt with in different branches of physics can be useful when confronting a new problem. It gives you the tools necessary to ask questions or learn more on your own. It helps combat the feeling of "Oh shit, I don't even know where to start."

Anyway, I'm not sure that's the answer you were looking for, but I'll leave you with my favorite wikipedia article: [The list of unsolved problems in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics).
Not a grad student still in undergrad doong an Associate of Science in Physics and there was a point in class where I saw some formula that at first didn't make sense then about a good 2 minutes of just looking at it and trying to understand what it was all the pieces just started to fall into place and I was able to start using one formula and then jump to the next and the next. Same thing happened to me in Comouter Science we were studying some problems that we had to make a program to solve and after looking at it for a few days all of a sudden I was able to write the code that solved the problems and everything after was just so easy. To me it just took time for the pieces to find there place and then BOOM it falls and everything around it starts to fit into its spot and it all starts to make sense.
Did 9 semesters of undergrad. Really started doing poorly in my 3rd semester, but I managed. Doing a Masters in semiconductors. We use basically everything I learned in undergrad. Many things have been clicking into place as topics get rehashed and we go deeper into the meat of it.

For example, I never really understood dielectric behavior. It is still fuzzy, but I do have a better grip after my optoelectronics course. We came to the complex dielectric constant via a Lorentz Oscillator. Looking at that in detail really helped. 

We basically do classic mechanics to make a basic model > tease it into quantum form to get the real behavior > EM to understand what it is useful for.

Undergrad isn't really about having everything in a neat little package. It is like reading the user manual for all the tools in a large toolkit that will use later. But you still don't have experience with them to know them on a 'personal' level. I know tools don't have personality but you know when someone says "ah with this drill, you have to wiggle this switch to get it to work right?"... That comes later after you have used the stuff for a while ;)
In second year I took a couple of theoretical physics modules, which covered Hamilton's principle, and Langrangian mechanics. I also read the Feynman lectures on Physics, which cemented into place the idea that if you start with a small enough rule, you can apply it to situations until you've described reality. The reason I liked the Feynman lectures is because he starts off with the assumption that atoms exist, and use this to explain all kinds of physical phenomena, and finishes along the lines of "if we understand by what rules atoms interact, we can explain how everything made of atoms will behave" or something like that.

That was pretty much when it clicked for me. If you are having difficulty, try reading around the subject with more width. Different people have different minds, so will need a different prompt to "make it click".
I'm 28 and things clicked for me last year.
As a small baby physicist, at the moment I'm looking forward to this. The start of my course has been self-contained bits and pieces from all over physics, with just enough tantalising links between them that I just know eventually something's going to click. They've taught electricity and magnetism somewhat separately, and only at the end did they begin to crossover. Along with this little bits of those courses subtly pop up in photonics lectures. I'm so pumped to get stuck in and start mashing everything together, I absolutely cannot wait. 

Edit: To actually answer the question, I don't know when but from what I understand the maths will start to cross over in a big way
Grad school. I'm not sure why or even what I did that really sparked the change. I can say I was forced to do really difficult problems/projects and my understanding was challenged often. So, I spent significant amounts of time studying, far more than undergrad. One day in stat mech I realized how far I've come because I was able to make connections with many other branches of physics. 
OP, I think taking a look at your general concept of science/math and what a universal theory would look like might help. "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" is good as is "Against Method". To see the overarching idea of science as a monolithic entity compresses the complex cultural, anthropological and philosophical human elements of science as the practice of discovering the world around us. These seemingly random puzzles and modules are a part of a language, created by man, from what he's observed over time. They are stories with subjects and syntax. You obviously speak the language better than you give yourself credit as you can successfully pass classes and test. The intro to Quark and Jaguar is a quick synopsis of the beauty of universal design and the overlap of biology, physics and math in their narrative and creation of it.  

Edited to answer your question: Grad School. Not a STEM major (MA in Philosophy). Amazing, passionate professors help. Picky their brains.
Probably when I got a grasp of the four major categories of theories:

* Quantum

* Relativistic

* Classical

* Electromagnetism

Most/all physics fits into these categories; now that I've seen enough of each, I can see an equation and understand where it comes from. There's a lot of overlap when it comes to field theories, which is definitely cool.

The stuff I'm learning right now (Physics III) is so basic that it's just a tiny subset of those things. So many empirical equations that I hardly consider it physics.

Now that I have this whole picture, I don't stress as much learning the *why* something is the way it is; I can glance at the reasoning and understand why the end equation is what it is. That helps a lot when I'm trying to figure out why an equation is what it is, and thinking to myself "now, what assumptions did they make?"

idk why I'm getting downvotes. Everything from physics comes from basic assumptions, and pretty much all of modern physics comes from those four major areas. Build an intuition for those, and when studying any physics topic, half the thinking is already done.
You need to kick it into high gear **yesterday** if you want grad school to be an option for you. I'll be honest, your GPA is low. Research experience is a totally crucial part of your application. You *need* around three letters of recommendation, so you've got to get on that immediately. The physics GRE is a huge deal and you should've started preparing by now.

I think if you really want to go to grad school, taking an extra year of undergrad and making up for the holes in your CV is your best option.

But I think you need to look deeply at whether or not grad school is even a good idea. The kind of behavior that led to your current situation will not fare well for you in grad school. Grad school is a huge step up from undergrad in coursework *and* research. Is this something you're really prepared for?
It depends on what you mean by grad school.

Yes, probably if you are looking for a top ranked PhD program in whatever specialization you are most interested in, you may be in a challenging position.

That said, I finished my B.S. in astro with right about a 3.1 major GPA, maybe even a 3.0, did just really awfully on the Physics GRE, did zero undergraduate research, and had almost no real relationships with physics professors - in short, what you might expect from someone with a completely unrelated second major and no interest in grad school during undergrad.

After taking about 2 years off, I enrolled in a state school M.S. program; I graduated with my M.S. in Medical Physics a little over a year ago and am currently interning at the IAEA laboratories outside Vienna working on pretty relevant and interesting things.

I understand the culture of graduate school physics is very competitive about awards and publications and placement and all that, and if that is the sort of thing you are trying to pursue you may want to seriously think about why you want to pursue physics and what it means that you are where you are.

However, if what you want is to teach, study, and do research in physics, that is absolutely something you can do with your life.

Also, man, maybe experiences differ, and I certainly went for applied and not theoretical or experimental work, but grad school was NOT a step up in coursework in my anecdotal experience.  This may not be representative though.
Everything Robus said, in double.

Your chances of grad school aren't *entirely* shot through, but your chances of a *good* grad school might be. You need to think clearly on *why* you want to go to grad school, *what* you hope to get out of it, and *how* you think it will be any different than what you've gotten yourself into now.

If you're really committed to going to grad school, you need to be able to help an admissions committee figure out the answers to those questions. You'll absolutely need to take that fourth year, because you need the research experience, you need letters of recommendation (why is your relationship with professors "severely lacking"? You want the same credential as them, and yet in three years you've never tried to ask any of them about it?), and you're going to have to practice to the point where you're near perfect on the physics GRE. If you've finished all the UG courses, take any graduate courses they offer, and ace them (the fear with a low GPA is an inability to make it through graduate coursework; a second major doesn't help, passing graduate coursework in physics might.)

Finally, if you're committed to graduating now, then maybe military or other public service can improve your application a bit (if you're a US citizen), but: a PhD is an academic degree. Mostly the thing that determines if you're a good PhD program candidate is if you were consistently very good (or at the very least consistently improving) in your previous academic degree.
The GPA at 3.4, 3.2 is not a wash out and the undergraduate GPA is not the only indicator of talent or predictor of later success.  If you feel strongly about continuing to the PhD, try to optimize your GRE performance and try to get involved in research in a topic that seems interesting and with someone who could and would advocate for you.   The question of whether a fourth year makes you a stronger candidate is a good topic to discuss with your new research advisor.
I'll give it a go. Sorry if it gets a little long and/or rambling, but you're asking about pretty deep subjects.

**Virtual particles and perturbation theory**: Virtual particles are mathematical terms that arise when you do perturbation theory. Basically, in a free QFT (that is, one without interactions between the fields) you can find the energy eigenstates and they look like particles: you have states of definite momentum, and you can put an integer number of "excitations" in these states. In other words, your typical eigenstate looks like "1 unit of momentum p1, 3 units of momentum p2, 2 units of momentum p3, etc". These "units" are what we usually call particles, though, as in regular QM, they're spread out over all space.

When you introduce interactions between the fields, you still have these "particles" as approximate eigenstates at times much before or after your interaction, but while the interaction is happening this picture kind of breaks down a little. What we do is perturbation theory: to calculate the probability of different transitions happening, you sum over a set of intermediate states (like in second-order perturbation theory in QM). These intermediate states are just like particles, with two exceptions. One is that they can have any mass at all, while normal particles have a fixed mass (like the photon being massless). The other is that they are unobservable by definition, since they are a mathematical convenience that arises when doing perturbation theory, not actual particles. Therefore, we call them "virtual particles", and draw them in little diagrams that help us remember the formulas.

---

**Off shell** refers to the mass shell, i.e. the hypersurface E^(2)-p^(2)=m^(2) (with c=1) in four-momentum space. It's a 3D hypersurface, but if you picture spacetime as being three-dimensional, it's a hyperboloid. An on-shell particle has a four-momentum whose square is its mass; an off-shell (or virtual) particle doesn't. For example, all real photons obey E = p; off-shell photons don't, their energy and momentum can take any values. Again, they aren't real particles; you'll never see an off-shell photon in a detector.

---

**Second quantization** is nothing more than a formalism for describing states with identical particles. See [this excellent answer](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/122570/which-is-more-fundamental-fields-or-particles/122571#122571) at Physics.SE, which explains it better than I ever could. Second quantization doesn't care about which kind of particles (virtual or real) you're describing. It's not really second quantization that requires particles to be eigenstates of the Hamiltonian; rather, particles are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. You don't have any choice. And while you can't have half a photon, I don't see why there's a need for smaller units of energy. You could always have a photon with half the energy,

---

I know very little about **non-perturbative QFT**, but I think some mathematical work has been done in lower dimensions. The most important example, however, is lattice QCD, where instead of doing perturbation theory you discretize spacetime and calculate path integrals that way.

---

**Path integrals and Hamiltonians**: There are two distinctions here. One is path integral vs operators, and the other is Lagrangian vs Hamiltonian. They are related but separate. The path integral is mostly used in place of operators (though not always, not by a long shot) because it's easier for theoretical calculations. The formalism of Feynman diagrams, for example, pops right out, while with operators it's a bit more work. Regarding the other alternative, the Lagrangian is mostly used in QFT because it's Lorentz invariant, while the Hamiltonian is not. And if you're using the Lagrangian, it's often more convenient to put it in a path integral.

--- 

**Virtual particles and destructive interference**: We're getting into tricky terrain here. People who actually know about this subject often disagree on how to interpret virtual particles, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.

I think what Wikipedia's trying to say is that the probability to observe an off-shell particle and/or an energy nonconservation (I'm not too clear on whether these are actually possible) is negligible for the scattering experiments we actually do, where we consider the particles to be eigenstates of the free Hamiltonian as t goes to infinity. I don't know what kind of destructive interference this is.

---

**Phase velocity**: I know even less about this topic, but what would it mean to have a negative phase velocity? Opposite to momentum? Either way, all I know for sure is that trying to treat virtual particles as real particles is dangerous. This is done sometimes when handwaving, but I wouldn't read too much into what Wikipedia says; virtual particles can indeed have any energy at all, but since they aren't actually particles that's all right.

---

Please ask if you want to know more! I'm just a humble student who sort of managed to learn QFT on their own from various books and internet resources, so I could be wrong about many things. I think what I said reflects the general consensus, though, especially when it comes to delicate topics like virtual partic.es
>What is the relation between perturbation theory and virtual particles? 

Your notion from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is correct, and it carries over to field theory with few modifications. To go straight to the point, when you develop a perturbation theory for field theories, you typically think of scattering problems (since they are the experimentally relevant application of field theory).

You start with an initial state that looks like the state of the free, interactionless theory (which you know how to solve), something happens, and you end up with a final state that also looks like a state from the free theory. The "something happens" is typically expressed in a diagrammatic language that can be heuristically identified with processes involving "particles".

For example, if an electron scatters off a nucleus, people will often say that the electron approaches, exchanges a virtual photon, and moves away. What they *mean* is that when doing the calculation in perturbation theory, the relevant diagram will have an internal line that has similar properties to the photon.

It's important not to take this picture too literally, however. Often individual Feynman diagrams will break symmetries of nature, and sometimes (particularly in nonabelian gauge theories) they will even include fictitious 'ghost' particles with impossible properties that come from tricks that make the calculation work properly. They have to be there -- in the diagram -- but it's hard to see them as being physical. What *is* physical is the sum of all diagrams at any given order in perturbation theory. 

>Is the phrase "off-shell" used as an analogy to electron shells? If so, what similarities between these systems exist?

No. Shell is just "mass shell", the hyperboloid of possible momenta for a physical particle. Being "off-shell" just means that these virtual particles don't respect the usual dispersion relations for that particle. This is unsurprising, since as I explained above, you shouldn't take the analogy too literally.

>Is there a connection between virtual particles and second quantization?

Second quantization is the beginning of the field theory story, and in this formalism the perturbative expansion looks very suggestive when viewed in terms of virtual particles. But other than that, they're unrelated concepts.

"Particle" is just a name, by the way. What it means is... eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. But to answer your question, no. Virtual particles are just as "quantized" as real ones, which, again, is something that you see in the "second quantized" form of field theory. A heads up though, the term "second quantization" tends to appear more among many body theorists and nuclear physicists, while field theorists prefer the term "canonical quantization". It's the same thing.

>Are there non-perturbative approaches to QFT that don't use virtual particles? What replaces their existence in these theories?

Yes. The prototypical example are lattice approaches: you discretize spacetime, and turn your fields into variables living on each site. You are then free to evaluate Feynman's path integral, by Monte Carlo simulation, for instance. You generate an ensemble of field configurations (or trajectories, if you want to think of the non-relativistic path integral for simplicity) and sum over those. The approach is fully non-perturbative since the path integral is evaluated directly, and there's nothing in it analogous to the concept of virtual particle which is pretty much exclusive to perturbation theory.

Often, even when doing perturbative calculations we don't bother with virtual particles either since diagrammatic expansions aren't the best way to deal with every problem. For example, let's say that you'd like to understand how the vacuum responds to an external magnetic field, or you want to calculate the zero point energy in the Casimir effect. You can pretty much just write down the path integral in the first case, or the vacuum energy in the second, and just do the calculation. In the first case you evaluate a functional determinant, which can be done e.g. by using an analogue of the Riemann zeta function, and in the second you can just sum up the zero point energies for each mode (which is written in terms of the sum of integers, which, non-coincidentally, is also related to the Riemann zeta function). 

It turns out that answering your question is hard, because each approach may be completely different, and since virtual particles aren't really physical they need not correspond to anything in a different formalism.

>Why are path integrals used in QFT rather than Hamiltonians as in Griffeths?

Because it's easier, particularly for gauge theories.

First, the path integral respects the theory's Lorentz invariance, whereas the Hamiltonian formulation breaks it -- so you better check at the end that you got a Lorentz invariant result.

Second, the standard model is a non-abelian gauge theory. This means that when you quantize it you have to be extremely careful in properly accounting for the many redundant parameterizations of the same thing. Two field configurations that *look* different may be related by a gauge transformation and thus be completely equivalent! In the path integral formulation, there are relatively straightforward methods for picking a gauge and ensuring that the end result is gauge invariant.

In the early days of field theory this was a challenge since the same perturbative calculations that had been done successfully in QED seemed to fail, giving non-gauge-invariant answers. This made it unclear how to consistently quantize Yang-Mills theory. The issue was resolved when Fadeev and Popov pointed out that this "picking of a gauge" required nothing more complicated than introducing the appropriate Jacobian in the path integral, and the rest is history. 

Now, in books (particularly older ones) you may see QED canonically quantized, but you'll never see QCD canonically quantized, because no analogue of the above trick exists. I'm sure it's possible to canonically quantize nonabelian gauge theory, but it's technically more involved.

Also, the Feynman path integral opens the path to numerical simulation, as I mentioned above.

>From Wikipedia:
>"The probability amplitude for a virtual particle to exist tends to be canceled out by destructive interference over longer distances and times."

That's just technobabble. An "amplitude for a particle to exist" is not really a meaningful concept in the sense being used here: operationally speaking, a particle "exists" if it can be detected, but a virtual particle cannot ever be detected, by definition. It is always an *internal* line in a diagram, whereas the *external* lines are supposed to represent interactions with our detectors.

>I'm really really starting to reach with this one, but could this possibly have something to do with the wavefunction having a negative phase velocity?

The concept of wavefunction loses its meaning in field theory. Some particles (massless vector particles such as photons) don't even have a wavefunction at all. The nonrelativistic limit of relativistic theories is actually quite subtle. You'll never see field theorists say that there's an "amplitude for a particle to be at x" -- they take the field point of view seriously, and take the field as the ontologically fundamental quantity.
[Get this book](https://www.amazon.com/Student-Friendly-Quantum-Field-Theory/dp/0984513957).

[Also, this book seems good.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/019969933X/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687682&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0984513957&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=894PJ6WQM0JG4ZZCZV7M) Granted I knew QFT by the time I started reading that book.

QFT is hard. Obtaining an thorough understanding it is probably the hardest thing I've ever accomplished in my life. To be honest, nothing that can be understood via words or verbal explanations will lead you to understanding QFT. You HAVE to work through the math. The words which we use to describe "virtual particle" fail the concept so miserably that we might as well not try (in my opinion).

If Griffith's is the furthest you'll go in QM and an UG book is the furthest you'll go in CM, you'll have a rough task ahead of you. Luckily, Klauber is EXTREMELY thorough and walks you through everything. 
Yes they're within the laws of physics. But so is travelling at 99% the speed of light. 

Material science/engineering is NO where near at the level needed to be able to build such a thing. 

So yes technically its a problem of engineering and is possible. But it is not possible for a few 100 years atleast. for the time being its a totally silly idea. 

You should completely forget about the idea of space elevators just as you should forget the idea of visiting alpha centuri   
Currently the only known material that makes a space elevator possible is defect-free carbon nanotubes.

Right now there is no cost-effective way of mass producing these.

LOTS of people are looking for this solution, for lots more reasons than just the space elevator. 


What people usually mean when they say "space elevator" is a concept proposed as a thought experiment in the victorian era, not a realistic attempt at engineering.

More reasonable ideas include: shorter tethers in lower orbits which you dock onto from a high altitude plane, rotating tethers that dip into the earth's atmosphere briefly several times as they orbit around the earth, and orbital rings which involve deflecting ballast around the earth at slightly above orbital velocity to support shorter elevator cables. Another concept called the launch loop is closely related in nature to orbital rings, but the ballast is deflected around a smaller loop, with a wide base on the ground at each end.

The main thing that sets these reasonable space elevator ideas apart from the victorian-era thought experiment is that they involve much shorter cables and structures, and can work with much lower tensile strength. Thus they do not have to be made using atomically pure carbon nanotubes, and the complexity of preventing issues like resonant energy buildup is lower.
 Even if it isn't possible at the moment it would definetly enable us to do space mission far more easy, than without an elevator.  The elevator would reduce the amount of money need to send things into space considerably, from usually 14-20k $ per kilogram  to a value with would lay in between a few  till a few hundred dollars per kilogram. Atm a Delta 4 rocket can lift 23000 kg for 400 mio $ which is round about 17000 $ per kg. Even the newest rockets can only bring things up to the LEO at costs of 90 mio $ for 53000 kg. 1 kg = 1700 $.  This is the reason why space stations where you have hangars  to build space vehicles aren't affordable by conventional means as the amount of money for such a station would go in the trillions. With something like an elevator we could build such a station for approximately a few billions.
Buzz Aldrin has said that any space elevator would be destroyed by any microsize grain of space dust. Unlike a craft, which can maneuver away from it, a space elevator would just get hit and possibly be weakened enough to snap.

How many times would a space elevator cable wrap around the Earth? (Not fully) Then there's the transport vehicle that would have to climb it. We're talking about 35,000 kms to be done in...a day? a week?

A more realistic one would be one on the Moon. It's good to first try it someplace else.

Also any "tear" in the carbon nanotube would be severely weakened by it. To the point it might not be able to handle the stresses any more.
JAXA was looking into building a space elevator, but I don't know if they had any design proposals yet. I personally think that [Skyhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_(structure\)) are much more viable than space elevators.

Edit: according to [this](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/168752/20160707/japans-space-elevator-technology-will-be-put-to-test-soon.htm) blurb, JAXA is on course to launch a miniature skyhook of 100 m length 'soon'.
Likely it is possible, Earth-Moon L1 space elevator is *certainly* possible.

To be honest though, i don't think they're likely to be sensible, given their apparent fragility, it'd have to dodge space debris. And climbers seem to always focus on relatively slow ~100m/s climbing speeds? Power is also separate. And you're not up to high speeds, i.e. you can be well into LEO at 400km/s up, but you're still only going a pathetic speeds, ~450m/s.(I just used the speed of a person standing on the ground at the equator...) at GEO you're 41⋅10^3 km from the center of the Earth, it is still only ~3km/s. This took ~5 days.

I think the [launch loop](http://launchloop.com/), or some kind of mass stream like this seems like a much better proposition to me. Less on the edge in terms of material requirements. Basically get that to ~50km or more up, where you don't need an evacuated track, just for the mass stream. And then have a track for the craft, bringing it up to 8km/s or more in a fairly short time. The track can still be in atmosphere enough to provide some protection, it is likely that maintainence is easier, and even possibly usable as train system between places on Earth.. (hang bits of evacuated tube down, run them underneath)

At 4G, 40m/s^2 it takes 200s, or.. well still 800km, it will be very large.. makes me wonder if a vacuum tunnel, and using mass streams to just keep the end aloft is better.. At least, for smaller versions usable for sending humans.

Around the time you build it, you expect space industry.. etcetera.
"Worth it" is an extremely personal evaluation, so it's hard to say.

As a senior in HS, you should just focus on finishing out well, getting into the school you want, and enjoying yourself.

Also, before getting too ahead of yourself, just getting  Physics and/or Math majors unscathed is a good step! Having that background isn't as foolproof as engineering, but if you finish a bachelor's and say "nah bro" to grad school, you won't be sunk.
My advice would be to study physics in college. It sounds like you really love it, and one of the great things about a college physics education is that it opens up so many doors. With the mathematical, technical and problem solving skills that you tend to develop while studying physics, you can transition to almost anything you want to. People who study physics go on to be practicing physicists in hundreds of different fields, of course, but they also make millions of dollars at hedge funds, become engineers and even doctors. I even happen to know someone who went to grad school for psychiatry after studying physics in college.

In other words, a physics education provides an amazing foundation for a great many other professions; it is not very hard to get into graduate or medical school in another field if you did well as a physics major in college, nor is it hard to find a job in many other fields that don't require a higher degree. If you decide money is your priority, it's often easier to get a job in finance with a background in physics than it is if you studied business, or even econ. On the other hand, if you study something that isn't closely related to physics (like engineering), it is *very* hard to break into physics.

If you study physics, you will learn whether or not you want to pursue it further, and you'll have a better grasp of the options within the field that are available to you. I would not get hung up on the $90,000 number right now, because the field is huge and an average is a poor representation of the options available to you, especially if you work in industry. In 10 years, $90,000 also might sound fine to you if you're doing something that you absolutely love! And if you decide that you don't want to follow that road, you will have opened many more doors than you will have closed.

You're in a great position; studying what you happen to be passionate about will set you up in a great way for the future. Some people have to choose between studying what they love in college and setting themselves up well for the future; you don't have to make that decision! If you don't study physics, you'll wonder what you missed, and if you do study physics, you aren't really limiting your future opportunities.
The advice I see around a lot is this:

Physics is a poor career choice. It's not made for anyone and many change majors after a few semesters. It's difficult, long, and requires a lot of dedication. You'll be studying and reading weekdays and weekends. Money isn't excellent, either.  
But it really doesn't matter what I tell you if you REALLY want to study physics.
For money? No, absolutely not.

This assumes that by "going into", you mean "getting a career in". But you can major in physics in college and have many, many different options open to you when you finish. You can even get a PhD in physics and still have many different options after finishing that. You don't have to decide now whether going into physics is worth it in the long run. (And you shouldn't. You don't have the information and experience now to make that decision.)
I would question that $90k number. If you do it right, you can walk out of a BS in physics and make tons of money. My friend (Math/CS) told me of a coworker with a BS in math who, with 2 years experience, got an offer for $130k + $50k stocks salary for data science and IMO physics prepares you better for data science. When you start looking into the hefty research done in almost any field, you will find physicists contributing heavily. Biology, computer science, electrical engineering, economics, machine learning, etc.
If it's any consolation... I'm currently an undergrad, and I love the prospect of becoming a physicist, but how my plan differs is that I am shooting for a double major between physics and computer science. 

In my mind, I am pursuing what I love in physics while simultaneously giving myself a practical foundation in computer science: something that I find myself naturally good at, that I enjoy doing, and is a high demand field that pays well. That way, if becoming a philosopher doesn't turn out well, then I have a fallback option that will provide for me far better than anything else. Hell, best case scenario is that I can pursue a PhD in physics and do research into quantum computing!

Sure, it may be asking a lot from myself academically, but I love to learn so taking on the extra work doesn't faze me one bit.

Hope this gives you some ideas!
Three things you should know before you choose:

1. You don't have to choose theoretical vs. experimental until you get into graduate school and choose a dissertation topic.

2. Physics graduate students typically do not acquire any debt because it is the norm for Physics departments to offer work as a teaching assistant or research assistant. And physics doctorate programs are not priced to exclude, like law or medicine are.

3. Job opportunities are far more numerous as an experimental physicist, since its is far easier to do experimental work with undergraduate students. Theoretical physicists are competing for positions at large tier 1 research universities or elite research centers like NIST or Perimeter Institute.
> worth it to make an average of $90,000 in theoretical physics?

I wouldn't put a whole lot of stock into that number personally. Physics is awesome, and a ton of fun, but the jobs are few and far between, especially when it comes to theoretical.
No.
It's hard to know whether you'll still be passionate or driven to study theoretical physics while at High School, university is a very different environment and the physics is unlike anything you learn at school. 

A Physics degree is a valuable achievement, however the pay is only good so long as you don't go into academia, industry or finance are the places of pecuniary delight. 

I'd say get an undergraduate on physics first, and if you are still passionate and willing, then go for the PhD in theoretical Physics. A lot changes while at university, we cannot always commit to the aspirations we had at sixthform or school.
The usual epistemological justification for the scientific method and the theories it produces is "it works" (at least within some reasonable scope). In other words, a theory is good if it can accurately predict the results of future observations and experiments.

To justify the standard model, then, you need to show that it works in practice.

This should not be a challenging task considering the vast number of predictions that the standard model gets right. You've already identified one of them. In addition to the Higgs boson, you can also talk about the W boson, Z boson, top quark, and charm quark...these are all particles that the standard model predicted before they were actually observed in the lab, and when they were eventually observed, their properties matched the standard model predictions well. And then you can talk about the essentially endless list of lifetimes, decay rates, cross sections, masses, etc. that have been measured in particle accelerators and shown to agree with the standard model prediction to many, many decimal places. 

By digging into the history of some of these predictions I think you could write a fairly convincing paper about how great the SM is, even without getting into technical details.

Another, more theoretical, approach might be the way that the SM, and particle physics more generally, has been able to use a single set of basic tools and ideas (e.g. Feynman diagrams) to explain previously disjoint theories in the same terms. 

But of course, no discussion of this topic would be complete without mentioning the limitations of the SM, and the times that it has predicted the wrong result. However, *every* scientific theory has a range of applicability outside of which it becomes less accurate.

>I couldn't come up with any real arguments as to why we should, also in the future, keep using the standard model

Even if the SM gets replaced by a larger, more complete theory in the future, the SM has already proved itself to be so accurate within its range of applicability, that I think it will always be a useful limiting case worthy of study. Compare with the way we still study classical mechanics and use it for certain situations even though it's been "replaced" by quantum mechanics/SR.

Finally, just to be clear: you haven't yet studied QFT as a non-layman, right? I'm assuming you're an undergraduate or a high school student or something. See if you can get a copy of *Introduction to Elementary Particles* by David Griffiths, and read the first chapter. In ~50 pages he basically covers much of the history of particle physics and the SM and its experimental successes, going into somewhat more detail than typical popular science sources but of course less detail than actual mathematical treatments of the theory so it should still be mostly understandable.


If your question is "why should we continue to use the Standard Model" in future:

If you are doing work that is within the scope of what the Standard Model predicts, then you can keep using it. By analogy, Newton's Laws of Motion are fine to continue using today, even though we now know it has limits, *provided* that whatever you're doing falls within those limits (e.g., if you were designing a bridge, you could ignore relativity and quantum physics quite safely)

But the whole objective of physics is to find better and better models, or in other words, we're *trying* to replace the SM with something better. There are some proposed candidates (e.g., String Theory, Quantum Field Theory), but there isn't enough physical evidence to replace the Standard Model... yet.
Particle physicists did literally thousands of measurements. How many of those clearly* disagree with the standard model?

0.

The SM is not perfect, and we all know that it is just an approximation - but it is an *extremely* good approximation in all the thousands of tests done so far.

\* you always have some statistical fluctuations or systematic uncertainties, so small deviations can be a result of those.
Arnold's *Mathematical methods of classical mechanics* has a couple of chapters on this. You should really have posted on the [book thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/531rq4/textbook_resource_thread_week_37_2016/), though.
Lectures on Symplectic Geometry by Ana Cannas da Silva.
McDuff and Salamon for straight up symplectic.
Lee has a chapter on symplectic Manifolds (if I remember correctly, he has many examples/problems that are worded in terms of classical mechanics) in his phenomenal text Introduction to Smooth Manifolds. I believe his symplectic section is the last chapter, but if you're new to differential topology, the whole book is worth a read.

If you're not so into the pure mathematician's topology, you can skip the first chapters (I believe the first 6?) and go straight to his section on tangent spaces, but if you're really into following all the proofs, you'll have to flip back and forth to some earlier chapters a couple of times. I find topology, by itself, really dry and boring, so I started with his section on tangent spaces and read the earlier sections when they became necessary. By the time I got to the end of the book, I wound up reading every chapter, so this method of skipping and reading the necessary preliminary material won't lead to less learning.

Besides, once you learn differential topology, your whole view of the universe will seem...so....holistic. I just felt like I understood so many things (Calculus, linear algebra, everyday physical experiences, phenomena that don't seem directly related to math, etc. I could go on forever) soooo much better. Enjoy!
Abraham & Marsden: *Foundations of Mechanics*
This might be good because it quickly reviews the necessary differential geometry.  That being said, I found the last chapter on moment maps pretty dense.

For polymers / plastics, it varies with the material composition, from [this JAMME article.](http://www.journalamme.org/papers_vol28_1/2816.pdf)
I would like to thank everyone for the helpful replies. I did some research myself and came to the conclusion that temperature cannot directly influence the coefficient of static/kinetic friction. However, temperature can affect the surface of certain substances such as rubber and plastic (not all kinds of plastic) which can therefore have an impact on the coefficient of friction. That's as much as my brain could take.
Great question, I don't know the answer to. I could only think of car brake pads; when they get hot they are less efficient b/c of lessening friction between the pads and the disk
If friction is largely the mechanical resistance to deformation of a material experienced by a large area of small interactions, then the raising temperature of a material would likely lower the friction coefficient due to reduced activation energy for deformation of the structure. But I am not a physicist. I've just seen this post on my front page for the last 9 hours thanks to the crappy front page algorithm and I decided to post my answer idea. 
Very interesting

I think I will make a passively cooled heat pipe system for my next PC build, and hang the whole thing on the wall like a tapestry.

What's the best medium to use in a heat pipe?
Eyeballing the [phase diagram of water](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg), looking at the intersect between liquid and gas at room temperature, I'm thinking that the pressure in the pipe is 3.5 kPa or so when at room temperature (and higher when heated). Would that be correct, or am I thinking of it the wrong way?
Btw it seems that your gifs don't loop.
[deleted]
not bad, but there are more intuitive ways to do it.
namely integrating definitions of displacement.

but for v=v'+at, just subtract v' and divide by t yielding dv/t = a. i don't think it can get any simpler than that.

for x=x'+v't+1/2at^2 , just take the integral of dx/dt = v'+at, where a is constant. 

or you can just multiply your initial v equation through time, since that's essentially what integration here is, except you have to know why the factor 1/2 pops up (power rule) and what to make of the constants of integration.

the time independent formula is a bit trickier tho, and i haven't run across a truely intuitive derivation. 
Experimental physics.
Obviously, you will want to focus on experimental research. In my experience the most hands on fields were condensed matter and AMO. There are also probably a few astronomy programs that get really hands on when it comes to building telescopes, but you will have to look into that.

Alternatively, many graduate engineering programs will have what you are looking for(specifically electrical engineering).
Aside from experimental physics, look at instrumentation programs, accelerator physics, optics, materials science / condensed matter and EE programs. Your background would lend itself to any of these fields of study.
Condensed matter, spectroscopy and electro-optics (applications)-lots and lots of hours in the lab-back of the envelope tinkering and such-good luck!
I would definitely recommend experimental materials science. I worked in a MS lab during my undergrad and at least 60% of the time I was doing something hands on. 60% may sound low but most of the EEs/chemistry guys were more around 10-40%. Granted that could be completely different elsewhere. 
One interesting thing about grad school in the hard sciences (and/or engineering) is that you can end up doing either experimental or theoretical stuff, regardless of the degree program.

For example, I'm in a PhD program in electrical engineering, and most of my work consists of writing computer simulations of quantum systems. I have a friend in the physics program, on the other hand, who spends his days making transistors by hand with scotch tape and measuring them with lasers.

What you end up doing in grad school depends almost entirely on your research advisor, and not quite so much on the particular major or degree program. Your best bet is to get an idea of what kind of stuff you want to work with, and then look for people who are doing research involving that stuff, regardless of which academic department they happen to be a part of.
That's beautiful!
How can you tell this is an adiabatic compression?

In England? Pick any school you want. 
In Germany? Any school you like.
In Australia. Pretty much anywhere you want. 
Same here in Texas.
Large demand in Canada.

Pretty much a large demand for any kind of science or math teachers who have actual degrees.
Ohio is hiring for physics teachers as well. 
Almost anywhere in the US? Pick any school you want. Great job security, too, since firing you means trying to replace you (means you can cut through a lot of bureaucratic BS and not worry too much; I would not recommend slacking off).

I was doing my PhD in physics when I decided to teach high school, instead, and got a job at one of the best schools in the state right away. I got lucky, but if you're a decent physics teacher you can find a job at a good school within a few years for sure.

One of the physics teachers at my school went on maternity leave last year, and the school ended up giving her classes to one of the chemistry teachers (who knew enough to also teach physics), and hired a chemistry leave replacement to take over the chem teacher's classes, because they couldn't find a single person for physics.
In UAE? Any school you'd like
In France there's a demand, very large in some *académies* (like Créteil but the work is very difficult).
I'm a student in high school student. My school is one of the best in the state and we only have two teachers that are certified to teach physics. One of the teachers retired last year and that caused a big problem.

Not sure what that means for the job market but that's just a personal anecdote
I'm not a particularly spectacular teacher and the pay here on Brazil is not exactly awesome but I always find multiple places to teach.
I'm sure it varies a lot depending on the exact job, and you have some freedom to set your own balance in a lot of places. But a fairly general rule for research jobs is that nobody is going to _discourage_ you from working more and "living" less.

And there are people who basically work all the time. They tend to publish a lot of papers, which makes them attractive as researchers.
Depends on what you want to do.

If you want the "glory," you need to be hungry. If you're not working hard and constantly thinking, someone else is. 

It all depends on what you want. Work in is what you get out.
If you're worried about being overworked in grad school (which is not uncommon), feel free to make that one of your priorities in choosing an advisor. Plenty of advisors are keen on making sure their grad students work hard, but they also don't want them to burn out. You have more power to bargain than you think, and if a prospective advisor isn't giving you any, then they're probably not a great choice for you.

Of course, don't expect to be as prolific as the top people in the field, but they're obviously the ones comfortable in making that tradeoff. A good lab puts people first and research second, imo.

You will have a lot of latitude to dictate what style of productive work is best for you in your career.
What ballance? 
> The Higgs boson could not have been discovered experimentally by accident.

ATLAS and CMS would have found the Higgs by now without dedicated Higgs-searches. The Higgs peak clearly appears in the diphoton and 4 lepton spectrum even without optimized cuts. Other decay channels and the less frequent production modes would be harder to find.

One could argue that the LHC and its experiments would not have been built, or built differently, without the Higgs predictions, but that quickly ends up in chaos theory instead of particle physics.

Edit: To extend that a bit: The author points out that a lot of theoretical research was cited by the collaborations. That is true. But that does not mean the discovery would not have happened without the prediction of a Higgs boson. It just means the experiments could not have compared the measurment to those predictions. Modeling the background in theory is nice, but (a) it is independent of the Higgs and (b) it is not required. The Higgs to photon measurements just use a smooth function to fit the background, without further theory input. The Higgs to 4 lepton measurement has a clear peak, you can either subtract the expected number of events or use a fit here as well (doesn't matter much, the main uncertainty is statistical as the total event yield is small).
Please change your link to point to the abstract, not the pdf.  Thanks.
This is awesome!  Bringing up the next group of kids with a basic understanding of the concept makes it WAY easier for them to grasp later on!
So could this be used for finding life on other planets?
There was an article going around a few months ago about a debate between Einstein and a philosopher named...Bergson? about the nature of time. After it occurred it was generally thought that Bergson had won. Bergson was one of the leading philosophical thinkers of the time, although clearly history has remembered Einstein more: http://nautil.us/issue/35/boundaries/this-philosopher-helped-ensure-there-was-no-nobel-for-relativity


I heavily suggest that you post a similar question over on /r/philosophy, as they're sure to have a better knowledge of the history of philosophy. As far as modern mathematics and philosophy are concerned, however, it's interesting to note just how intertwined they were (esp. in the early 1900s). Take a look at [this article](http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/22/Allendoerfer/1980/0025570x.di021111.02p0048m.pdf) for more information. That's probably my single favorite piece of scientific/mathematical/philosophical exposition. It ties everything neatly into a few pages while managing to keep it accessible to laypeople.
Interesting question because philosophers are historically tied to power structures that have every incentive to stifle scientific knowledge. You'll find that the most important advances in "natural philosophy" are also tied to a breaking away of old power structures of church and/or monarchy. The Renaissance, the French Revolution,  The Russian Revolution, and the post-World War cynicism & existentialism.. all of these were paradigm shifts in individual freedom as well as science-centric worldviews. So literature from these times will tell you a lot about living through a time of philosophical upheaval.

Specific examples- Socrates, Democritus, Renaissance architecture+art, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Karl Marx, the dadaist movement... I could go on and on.

What textbooks would everyone recommend on statistical mechanics, especially (but not exclusively) on the link between statistical mechanics and quantum field theory?
any online lecture series on Classical Electrodynamic? Also on tensor.

TIA

Writing a summer essay for Uni on the information paradox. If anyone can recommend any good resources on that at an undergraduate level (UK university, going into my 3rd year) I'd be really grateful!
Suppose I have read both the Halliday & Resnick intro Physics book and the Sears (et. al.) book University Physics.  What next?  

It may help to know that I have a BA in Math and can read pretty much any intro graduate level Math textbook, but I often find that when physicists use any Math above Calculus in a textbook it makes no sense to me. 
I'm looking for textbooks with information about ferrofluid's properties and their theoretical explanations. If someone can recommend any, I'll be grateful.
Currently reading Vibrations and Waves MIT intro by French for one of my courses, is there a good complementary book to this one? 
I just graduated with a bs in Physics, and while gard school is not currently in my plan, I'd still like to further my knowledge. so any recommendations for graduate level texts that are good for self study? 
Graduated with biophysics degree. I want o study quantum field theory on my own tho. What are the best text books?

I posted this in the previous thread, but possibly too late as I never got any responses. Here it is again:

>I want to understand the Dirac field better than I do. Peskin and Schroder and Tong's notes did an alright job of getting me to turn the crank but I really want to be able to grok it. Does anyone know of a good text that introduces the Dirac field and spinors alongside the requisite representation theory and geometry to really understand it?

>I've had some differential topology, so I'm comfortable with Lie group and Lie algebras, bundles and the like. I'm looking for something more math-focused than Peskin and Schroeder, for instance. 
Any recommendations for self learning general relativity, cosmology, and/or quantum mechanics?
Anybody know of a good reference for Seiberg-Witten theory?
I'm a little late to the party, but it is worth a try. Is there a more up to date text on physical cosmology?

In particular, the topics covered in Peeble's 'Principles of Physical Cosmology' and Peacocks 'Cosmological Physics'. 
Free physics text book - http://www.motionmountain.net
Anything that describes superfluids or superconductors in terms of differential topology (forms, Manifolds, etc.), would be greatly appreciated! Even papers or articles would be useful, thanks!
Here's a list of video resources too.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/48i7nu/the_ultimate_collection_of_free_physics_videos/
Is there a good video series anyone would recommend over Khan academy to go along with Physics 1 - Mechanics? My professor just moved to my college from being at a graduate school for close to 30 years. He's one of the nicest guys I've ever met, but he's having an incredibly hard time bringing his teaching style down to students who only have calc 1 under their belts. In other words, his lectures so far have only served to confuse us more.
>Does the uncertainty principle arise because these basis' do no overlap? And when basis' do overlap, what consequences does this have?

The uncertainty principle exists because those two observables are incompatible. The position and momentum operators do not commute (they obey [x,p*_x_*] = i~~h~~).

This means that they're not simultaneously diagonalizable.

They do not share a basis of eigenstates.

If one is well-defined, the other is not.

All of the above statements are equivalent to each other.

You can derive a generalized uncertainty principle for two arbitrary operators, and the minimum of the product of the variances in the two observables depends on the expectation value of their commutator. If they commute, the minimum uncertainty is zero.
> Does the uncertainty principle arise because these basis' do no overlap?

No, they do overlap: the overlap <x|p> is given, up to a normalization, by e^ip·x. I'm sure this is an expression you've seen before.

The uncertainty arises because the operators x and p do not commute, and thus, it is not possible to construct a basis in which these operators are simultaneously diagonal. The position basis is nothing more than a basis in which the position operator is diagonal -- this may sound obvious, but it's good to have it said explicitly in these situations. What it means is that if you're in a position eigenstate (i.e., a state vector which is one of the basis of the diagonal representation of the position operator) you know you cannot be in an eigenstate of momentum as well. You must be in a superposition.
Roughly speaking, particles in solution just move randomly.   It doesn't matter whether they 'bump into' solvent or solute.

When you have a large number of particles, then all their random movements put together will work out to movement from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration on average.

Supposing you have two solutes - call them A and B - you should get the same predicted diffusion if you pretend that A and B are the same as you get if you work out the diffusion for A, and then the diffusion for B, and add them together.

You seem to be describing a situation where the *pressure* varies between regions. For instance an ideal gas, where concentration (n/V) and pressure (P) are directly proportional. In that case, yeah, for sure! Then there's going to be an overall flow of particles from high pressure to low pressure, because all the particles in the high pressure region are bumping each other out. This will be *in addition to* the diffusion effect we're talking about, and might even overwhelm that effect altogether.

But the situation we're dealing with *here* is a different one. Temperature and pressure are in equilibrium; for every mL of fluid that enters a region, another mL leaves. If a particular region is unusually high in oxygen and low in CO2, then the fluid leaving that region will tend to be high in oxygen and low in CO2, and the fluid replacing it will tend to be lower in oxygen and higher in CO2. Therefore in general, oxygen is diffusing out of that region, and CO2 is flowing in.
Let's suppose I have a box with N red particles on the right and N blue particles on the left. Overall, the box has a constant concentration everywhere. If the particles followed what you're saying, the red particles would never move to the left and the blue ones would never move to the right. That is, they would never mix. This absurd; a bunch of particles moving randomly have to mix eventually.
all snark aside, why does U.S law prohibit Nasa and the CSA from working together?

the US refusal to **all** SI units is confusing and dangerous
Wait, so they're pissing and moaning about converting from units in centimeter-gram-seconds to units in meter-kilogram-seconds. I completely understand the SI over imperial arguments, but this is essentially saying, "It's not enough to be in a system where conversion is in powers of 10, I need everyone in the same powers of 10, even if that results in unwieldy, derived units." The article even complains about having to deal with microsieverts and millisieverts. If you are dealing with a Sievert, you might want to rethink life choices.
You can't use the curie-meter-rem rule with the SI units. I don't see how they are superior in any way. The becquerel is kind of like throwing out the intuitive gram and using amus for all calculations. Sure, you could do it, but why?
This is such stupid rationale...

1) Sievert to rem you literally have to multiply or divide by one hundred. It's so fucking easy.

2) The fact that the gray is a Joule/kilogram is so not important every day health physics. The fact that you would need to talk about doses in microsieverts and milisieverts when we are already used to using milirem and rem would be such a pain in the ass.

3) Bequerels are stupid and cumbersome. With curies you get some perspective just by way of the prefixes. Microcurie = a little, you're fine around it. Milicurie = it's getting warm. Curie = a lot.

4) We already are forced to use Bq when transporting packages anyways so that doesn't change shit.

5) 5 Rem per year is way less cumbersome than 50 milisieverts per year.

Fuck the haters
There is a much simpler reason for the move to the SI system - collaboration.  Why not join everyone in the SI lounge, rather than hanging around in the Imperial kitchen?
Ahh, the old SI circle jerk. Can't go a week on reddit without it.
No. Different people use different units. The fact that some people will have to convert units will never change. Get over it.
I have joked many a time that I believe in a misanthropic principle that string constructions are too often integrable (algebro-geometric) and nature is why we can't have good things.
First sentence:

>String theory has so far failed to live up to its promise as a way to unite gravity and quantum mechanics.

Completely wrong. Maybe they meant something different, but this is simply the opposite of the truth. 

Strings succeded in this unification, while everything else has failed.

Kind of ruined the whole article.
Just maybe, string theory may show up something we missed in an unrelated field such as AI (ie simulating an 11 dimensional neural net on a 3-D+T lattice)
From the [workshop abstracts](https://indico.fias.uni-frankfurt.de/event/2/abstract-book.pdf), this looks to be a very interesting program with many prominent researchers in the field giving talks.  I was interested to see that Sabine Hossenfelder in her blog post said the talks will both be recorded and livestreamed. This will be the 5th in a series of workshops on this topic.

Once I saw this, I was interested to see if there were any online materials from previous workshops in this series.  So far, I found [talk slides from the 2014 workshop](http://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/~hossi/Physics/esqg1401.pdf), [video and slides from the 2012 workshop](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/experimental-search-quantum-gravity-hard-facts), this paper from the [2010 workshop](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3420v1.pdf), and [video and slides from the 2007 workshop](http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/video-library/collection/experimental-search-quantum-gravity-2007).
The double slit experiment was invented and performed almost 100 years before Schrodinger was born.
While I'm not an expert on QBism, I can tell you that it does not say that your personal beliefs alter the outcome of experiments. Rather it's saying that QM should be viewed as a way to describe your subjective knowledge about the system. Not too different from the Copenhagen interpretation. 

People didn't just float around until Newton discovered gravity. Similarly, knowing, or not, of QM doesn't change the outcome of experiments.  
I've only read summaries, like [this one by Mermin](http://www.nature.com/news/physics-qbism-puts-the-scientist-back-into-science-1.14912).  It has references to Caves et al.  Supposedly qbism resolves the weirdness.  But I've yet to hear the anything practical.
Sure.   I played with diffraction gratings and looked at holograms before I knew about Schroedinger's equation.

Great tool! I'd be interested to see laser optics integrated. It'd be neat to be able to set-up simulated quantum optics experiments. I thought about contributing and I took a peek at the JavaScript code but most of the comments weren't in English. Any chance you could translate those?
This is seriously amazing. Sent it to my optics teacher from last semester, hopefully it will help some people out!

I would love to see a full wave simulator, but I know there's a hell of a lot more coding there.
Really cool application, and well done.

Maybe I missed it, but it would be nice the presence of an option that allow the user to define the coordinates of the objects exactly?

However, congratulation.
Awesome, I've always wanted to write a tool like this, but never had the time. I would love it if you could include colored light sources and dispersion!
I'm curious about everything. I just want to know what this place is and how it works - all of it. Whenever I asked those questions and followed the chain to the end, I got to physics, math, and philosophy. Out of those three, I picked the field with the highest probability of an accident granting me super powers.
I don't.

Physics is like a shop that sells the hardest and most challenging puzzles and certainly the most fun.
Because it's cool
Physics explains us why matter look to us in this way. Have a very wide range, from sub atomic particles to the whole universe. We can get answers why these things come to us with these physical features.
I really like nature, in general, not just the living side of it like most people. And physics is really a good thing to do if you appreciate those things: math and concepts that allow you to make predictions or "magic". I'm easily disturbed by things I don't understand, specially things in nature, I don't care that much about human nature questions, but physics, math, biology, chemistry bother me really easily 

Because it's the one thing that can constantly feed my curiosity for how the world works. There are *so* many things left to be rationalized and discovered and it just made me so happy being able to debate quantum physics with my sophomore physics teacher to simply understand more of how it all fits in.
The world is a myster constantly being solved and made complex. It's fascinating and solving problems feels good. You also have cool practical uses
I'm a Senior in Physics/Astronomy applying for grad school this year.

Anyone here a physicist in industry? What's that like/any tips for those who might want to take that path?
How much after hours work is involved with a physics career? I'm sick of coming home and studying hard every night aha
Long story and need advice.

I did my undergrad in mechanical engineering, I didn't want to work as an engineer because when I tried it out it was a soul crushing experience...you are basically a toll with little respect, boring meaningless projects...even the senior engineers weren't any better off they spent most of their time on perfecting their power point presentations and of course no  flexibility in the hours. So I know work as a sales engineer on electrical equipment, which has great flexibility, I'm on the road a lot and the money is decent but I'm not learning anything technical and I feel my brain rotting. So I wanted to do my masters and after studying a little in some physics text books, I enjoy it a lot. But what can I do with a master's in physics? I hear phsyisits don't make much money and job opportunities are scarce. I wanted work in someplace exciting, I was always interested in aerospace maybe I could do something at NASA? Idk anything about this field, can someone provide me with some direction and guidance?
In the Uk is a masters really worth the extra year? Do people with masters make a lot more on average than people with a bachelor's?

Do you have the usual visitors tour? Just follow the tour and see what it includes. Typically a short trip to the ATLAS control room (in walking distance), probably a visit of the main control center (via bus) and maybe the magnet test facility (via bus). Those three places have areas designed for visitors. I don't know if there are other stops - the official tours are not *that* interesting if you work there...

The microcosm exhibition is next to the place where the tours start, and you can explore that on your own.

Do you know someone there who can organize a visitor pass for a day? That would allow to visit more places.
Dude, i'm so jealous. Be sure to buy their Langrangian mug, becuase I want that mug so bad.
Sure, why not? Deep down interference is interference, whether you are talking about matter waves or sound waves. The trick is just to maintain a well-defined phase relationship in your system and then you will see peak and troughs depending on whether you get constructive or destructive interference. For example, just like you can do the double slit [with electrons](http://i.imgur.com/RPU2ALm.jpg) you could also do with it with sound waves, or [water waves](http://i.imgur.com/26iDAhg.png), etc, etc.
What is "de Broglie interference"?  All waves can form interference patterns.  Water, acoustic, quantum, whatever.
The dispersion relation for sound waves (tipically ω ~ k) is pretty different from that of de Broglie waves (ω ~ k^(2)). They don't act the same. But if it's interference as a general phenomenon you care about, sure.
[I think you'll like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmC0ygr08tE)

However, you can't get the more interesting aspects of quantum mechanics like entanglement from this. 
Is something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BnBLDkuJZk) what you mean?
I'm not sure that De Broglie interference is something that's worth simulating:  The aspect of it De Broglie wavelength that's intriguing is that things which we like to think of as particles have properties we associate with waves.  Wave interference really isn't that exciting once you accept that things are waves.
Which measuring range do you need? Maybe gallium liquid - solid transition is good
0.1C is not saying much unless you know the range your interested in covering. You can correct for pressure dependence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_point
Assuming you have linear response, using dry ice or liquid nitrogen is a great way to get data points with high lever arm for your fit.
Do you have an accurate method of weighing stuff out? If so, you could measure out a known amount of salt and add it to a known amount of ice water. You can use [Freezing point depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing-point_depression) to determine what the temperature is.
There are a number of temperature standards.

http://us.flukecal.com/products/temperature-calibration/its-90-temperature-standards

A triple-point cell is used as a practical realization of an absolute temperature: the triple point is at one and only one temperature and pressure. The cell is designed to have basically pure water and no air or other impurities, and the three phases of water vapor, liquid water, and ice, occur at one point of the phase diagram.

For the other points, it depends very much on what application and temperature range you have. Metal freezing points can be good standards. But for 100 C or so, you are best off just getting another calibrated thermometer: best is to use that thermometer and a control system to keep a large bath at a known fixed temperature. Then you put your uncalibrated thermometer in that bath, wait for it to equilibrate, then you have calibrated it.
Is this a practical problem? Because in theory you could keep varying the pressure and temperature of water until you encountered the triple point, which occurs only at a single specific pressure and temperature.

You could also grab a sample of magnetized iron and heat it. Iron undergoes a phase transition and will stop being ferromagnetic at a certain temperature, which IIRC it's an intrinsic property of the material and so doesn't depend on other quantities like pressure.
It's a physics lab, so you gotta have a harmonic oscillator of some kind!!  Make it damped/driven if you want to add some beef to the analysis.  If you couple two of these oscillators together, you can get chaotic motion, and there is a lot of neat analysis you can do for that.  Several college level upper level physics labs have this kind of chaos experiment, so you should be able to find some details with a bit of googling.

Another idea would be to have the students build up their own PID controller.  For example, you could have them build a heater with temperature control.  PID control is ubiquitous in experimental physics and in industry, so it would be great if the students could really learn how it works.

Anyway, best of luck.  Sounds like a great class!
If your lab is about computer-aided measurement, then it seems like you ought to start with the sensors and work back to the experiment.

Optical gates are nice, but you really ought to include some other stuff like thermisters (Newton's law of cooling), range finders (pendulum motion), microphones (frequency response of tuning forks) , and direct electrical measurements (are LEDs and solar cells the same thing?)
You might be able to measure the speed of light with a long enough fibre optic cable and an arduino. Although you might need some more specialized measurement electronics.
A fun little expansion to your electromagnet idea could be to use an Arduino as a PID controller to measure the temperature of the coil using a thermistor and control it via PWM.

Edit: Just read this was already suggested, my apologies.

There's also a ton of optics experiments you can do using Matlab: using a sensor on a stepper motor to read intensity of diffraction patterns and conduct error analysis is a pretty simple one.
Not sure if this is in line with your students physics level, but I remember reading a recently published paper that proposed a relatively simple experiment that would basically demonstrate a way of making photons behave like fermions. I was amazed because it seemed like a relatively simple setup/procedure that had awesome results. Here is the paper http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/4/e1501748

I think it might be appropriate for a senior level lab or so, but I never did it so I'm not sure
You could do it in the same way Kerbal Space Program does it I guess (just simplified to 2D).
Introduce Spheres of Influences for the bodies and within these spheres assume that only the gravity of that  one body affects the ship. Then you have 2 options:
1) you have now only one body to consider so a dynamic solver would not be too hard. Use Velocity Verlet or Leapfrog for calculating the orbit
2) the orbit of your ship around said body can be represented by conic sections:

Is it considered surprising in the community that LIGO now managed picked up a signal from multiple inspiraling binaries, but not from any supernovae? At least from [this plot](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Gravitational-wave_detector_sensitivities_and_astrophysical_gravitational-wave_sources.png) it seems like aLIGO was designed to operate in a frequency sweet spot where both types of events could be seen. Now naively I would have expected that it would have been more common for supernovae to occur close enough to us to kick off gravitational waves powerful enough to be picked up by LIGO than black hole mergers (which I would have guessed were pretty exotic). I would appreciate any insight from anyone more familiar with the field. 
May I ask a question? 

General Relativity states that gravity isn't really a force but actually the curvature of space-time distorting an object's movement toward the mass producing the said "force". 

From my understanding of particle physics, evrey force has a mediating particle. In the case of gravity, this is the graviton. 

So how do these two theories reconcile. If gravity isn't really a force but rather just the curvature of space-time, why does it need a mediating particle? 
Not really a question on the physics but isn't anyone else put off but how badly a few physicists kept the secret before the announcement? Krauss flat out tweeted it, Motl alluded to it. I think it was unprofessional and dishonest and could have turned into absolute hell for LIGO if the discovery hadn't panned out.

Perhaps what happened with Krauss for example is he thought being trusted with the information somehow meant he was part of the team, and that leaking that information would have consolidated him for the "divulger" role in that team. Like there's a medal for being the first to know. In the end he's just been a huge dick.
Any chance there have been any developments with GWs and their relation to the MACHO theory of dark matter? I remember reading [this](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.201301) abstract, but I haven't really heard anything about it otherwise.
I remember the first one made me think "wow, the first one we detected was that early after turning on the detector, black hole mergers must be really common!" and then after the second one I thought "that's it? black hole mergers must be really rare."
> What makes these black hole binaries which can merge in the lifetime of the universe?

Do we know the rough age of these black holes ? If they are very ancient then maybe there is less mystery as the earlier universe was more dense - so perhaps things that clumped together earlier clumped together more densely, and whatever was left over is the matter that forms the galaxies around clumps of black holes.

Is there a maximum distance for an event to be detected? That is, if two galaxies merged and were very far away, would the signal arrive at the speed of light, undegraded, or would it 'fade' out.
Ok, they first detected something, those colliding black holes, only a few days after they switched it on.

Have they detected anything since?

I think it's peculiar that this text is written as if retrocausality were some *solution* to the issue of action at a distance, rather than just a mere reskin of it. It's just as hard to reconcile retrocausality with special relativity, because the *reason* we avoid instantaneous action at a distance is that a boost to a different frame results in messages going back to the past in some frames and to the future in some others. Having it go a circuitous way, together with contrived rules so you can't send a message to your infant grandfather, changes nothing.

You shouldn't worry about how hard it is, you should worry about how much it interests you.
The project seems fine, nothing a committed undergrad couldn't handle.  If you've taken a course already that had some aspects of quantum information and numerical computation you could probably hit the ground running without much difficulty.  Otherwise you'll need a bit of lit-review, but that's to be expected.

I want this framed. Be fairly epic.
This is my field and I notice there are no comments here. If anybody wants to ask questions, feel free.

>For condensed matter physicists, this is like the Big Bang.

This isn't even an exaggeration, btw.
Can you explain it without using the word topological?
"We denote velocity as u to distinguish it from potential, and potential as U to distinguish it from velocity."
Because "P" is used to denote momentum. 

It's not always U. For the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, typically one uses "V". 
Because U have the potential to call it whatever you want
Well, the letter itself kinda resembles a potential well... That's very post hoc though
As far as I know, the potential is always called V or phi on the case of gravitation, while the [_potential energy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy) is called U.
"The scientists showed that this electrophobic property would allow the particle to solve both the proton and muon problems."

... yes. If you can tune the coupling to every particle separately, you can change the muon g-2 and proton radius measurements without getting the electron measurements wrong. How surprising.

Mass and coupling strength of this proposed particle are two free parameters, and they get two measurements in agreement with it. Again: Surprise, surprise!

Still worth more investigation, but getting n predictions right with >=n degrees of freedom is not really convincing.

Is annihilation predicted by all WIMP models?
It is going to be very disappointing if DM turns out to be just missing normal matter that was severely underestimated. It would be great that one of the biggest modern mysteries of physics is answered, but usually in science when a question is answered another is discovered, it is going to feel empty if it is going to be "That's dark matter, case closed".
I agree that for more involved calculations in EM or fluids component notation is better. Del notation is not so terrible, though. For one, it emphasizes that vectors are objects independent of their components. It looks prettier. And most importantly, it works in any coordinate system. Component notation doesn't, unless you use the metric tensor and up-and-down indices, which is definitely not simpler.
[deleted]
Most calculations using vectors in 3D tend to be easier using vector notation because 3D vectors are a special case in which complicated operations take cuter forms (the curl comes to mind). I think Feynman has a section on that in his lectures. Furthermore, in another section Feynman mentions you can further extend the usefulness of vector notation by being explicit on what each differential operator acts on so you can write them in any order. For example, your d/dxi (ui * uj * p) can be written as **∇**_R · **u** **u** p where _R makes it explicit you apply nabla to everything on its right. Had I written **∇** · **u** **u** p, then it's unclear if nabla acts on the first **u** or everything, while writing **∇** · (**u** **u** p) is absurd. Feynman's derivation of the Poynting vector using "free" vector notation is great example of something that should be impossible or laborious in normal vector notation.

Feynman does mention, though, that you need to be able to switch to component form on occasion since some problems are just plain easier that way.
Sorry I'm not familiar with del notation, can anyone explain?
Can someone in materials explain what this site does that the CCSD doesn't do? Lots of nice pictures, so looks like a decent outreach tool, but what's the new research content here?

It would be nice if non-elemental crystals were included.
Are you talking about lasers or ordinary incoherent light? You can't really make a 'white light' laser beam, so I'll presume you're talking about incoherent light.

> 1. Both being light, does the density of light in area X increase?

The question doesn't make sense. Light itself it not a substance that can be spread over space thinly or thickly like peanut butter. If you're asking if there's more light in X than there would be in only A or B individually were 'on,' then certainly yes. We can say that the intensity of the light in that area will be larger.

> How does X change both A and B? Does the intersection cause either A or B to reduce velocity after passing through it? Does it change the light beans in any way?

Presuming that X is just an empty region of space, It basically doesn't change anything. At the classical level, the two light beams pass right through each other without any interaction. It's a linear theory, so if we know that A is a solution to Maxwell's equations in region X, and B is a solution, then the very mundane A + B is also a solution. The velocities remain exactly the same because the form of the electromagnetic wave equation does not change. There are quantum and general relativistic corrections, but they are tiny tiny tiny tiny for everyday light here on the Earth, etc.

> Is there any light residual that can be detected in X?

If X contains some kind of material, then there could be some residual effect there.

If X is just empty space then there is also some residual effect (the electric and magnetic fields will not be exactly 0 always), but for a realistic pulse of light such a residual would VERY quickly become too small to measure and distinguish from random noise.

I doubt there's anything super unexpected going on here. The theory has been around for over 100 years at this point. And if we shift focus to a similar question, but with lasers, such scenarios happen every day in hundreds or maybe thousands of physics labs. If anything crazy were happening, someone probably would've noticed it (but maybe not, you never know for sure).
Choosing a project can be difficult and overwhelming. Do not focus so much on what problem to study, but rather what topic you want to explore. You have to do your own soul searching. I would recommend something basic you actually want to learn more about, not what sounds "sexy".

Afterwards, the work you do in learning the topic will help generate a problem to explore. Anything you do will contribute to the project. 

Had to learn new mathematical techniques? Boom, a new section of the project. Applying it to a physical scenario? Boom, another section of the project. Building a hands-on model of the problem? Boom, another bit to present. Make some graphs to explore relationships of variables? Boom, you got yourself some data!
Perhaps you could simulate a physical system. There are a lot of physical systems which can be simulated with high school knowledge (and a bit of additional reading on numerical integration, but that shouldn't be a problem if you know calculus), for example: the three body problem (you can do a simplified version with two static bodies and the third one moving in their gravitational field) or the double pendulum. These would be common examples and you can probably find code online if you get stuck, too.

You can also go interdisciplinary by simulating a biological or chemical system modeled by equations - look up oscillating chemical reactions for example or the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model, anything modeled by differential equations, really. 
I like the non-linear dynamical system simulations suggested below. Highly accessible at high school level, and you can explore some cool maths including fractals and fractional dimensions.

I just wanted to add one thing:
> on a level of high school physics (including quantum mechanics)

Stay away from quantum mechanics. You do not have the background to study this yet and will *not* understand.
EDIT: I have to have some sort of a question to answer, for example: why is the sky blue. 
Perhaps you could do a study on diffraction/interference--a laser and a hair is pretty neat, plus sound waves would be easy to demonstrate with music tuners (as long as they emit a sound) and you can correspond it to particles as waves (electron diffraction).
> the idea that the Darwinian principle of natural selection is the only underlying source for the truly novel complexity we find not just in the biological world but everywhere in the universe. 

wat
The only way to test this would be to measure the gravitational constant throughout the universe? Would that prove that forces and matter evolved or didnt based on the inconsistant values?
I liked the article the writer is very good and inspiring.
>Suggested puzzle enhancements are welcome.


Something to simulate the [broken time-reversal symmetry](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/131219/ncomms3927/full/ncomms3927.html) seen in the sandpile avalanche model?
You don't use an actual particle accelerator for an hour, your proposal is ran through a simulation of a particle accelerator. 
Less than 1 day of registration? 15:00 in which time zone?

Why do you need the time slots?
Just to clarify: you don't get to control a particle accelerator. 
iirc You get it to control a setup creating a Bose-Einstein condensate.
It is not a simulation: through the ALICE software you control the lasers cooling and movement of the condensate.
I always love the way this [Newsroom clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1cMnM-UJ5U) discussed climate change. So nonchalant, the same way most news media treats climate change, yet so terrifying.

I truly believe we are living in the last 100 - 200 years of civilization, if no large scale change is made. 

Please, someone tell me I'm wrong.
I have a controversial solution to the global warming - global 1 child policy.

It does not sound very ethical and on top of the global warming problems we will have problem of having too many old people and slower technological advancements. But having half or less people in the world probably would be the biggest and fastest way to stop global warming. 

It would be great to have, for example, less than a billion people in the world..

The problem is not with taxation. 
If governments and banks cannot do anything against global warming with highest debt ever incurred then why would I believe that any sensible actions against GW will be taken if we double or triple public debt or increase the taxes twofold??

Currently GW is only a tool for stronger countries to stop the development of industries in weaker countries.

Last bit of xkcd's is where all the forgery and discredit and cover ups are happening. There's been no warming in a couple decades. We still need a few years until all this fraud collapses, probably when the real drivers of climate change are proved, like the Sun. In the meantime, we cannot prevent all the waste on this subject. After that, our best hope is to take the lesson and isolate science from politics. Unfortunately people will probably look the other way and learn nothing. Saving face is more important than progress.
Capitalism is to blame.
Not disagreeing with need for climate change action but 90% of this diagram is unnecessary because Randal has smoothed out the historic data, so it doesn't address the statement at the start. Or better still, just include the projections and historical ranges because that's the only useful part of the whole thing. Do a better job and don't look like you're forcing your point through manipulation, because that's unnecessary. 
Part of how planets and dwarf planets are defined is that they must be in hydrostatic equilibrium - approximately round. For rocky objects this sets in at about 800 km diameter.

The asteroid Vesta is about 500 km in diameter and resembles a [giant potato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta). It is probably the largest potato-shaped object in the solar system. Ceres has a similar history but at 900 km it is [a golf ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_\(dwarf_planet\)) and was relatively recently reclassified as a dwarf planet instead of an asteroid because of this.

Code::Blocks is an IDE, not really what you would call a compiler (although it will run a compiler).

are you asking about an IDE for debian (that will likely call one of the standard compilers, like GCC, clang, or intel c++ compiler, don't know if it does C or just C++) or purely a compiler?

some of those compilers named above (and others)  are also used by Code::Blocks on windows.

as for programming i use the atom text editor (for several languages) and you can install plugins to "run" your code (i.e. either compile, or call the interpreter if it's python or compile it and display the pdf if it's latex).

for compiling stuff on linux you might want to get familiar with Makefiles (GNU make).

Hello, I'm having a real hard time getting around the reality of a hollow cylinder accelerating more slowly than a solid (non-hollow) cylinder that are both set free at the top of a slope with a consistent angle.

I have been looking things up for a day or so and I am being told that it is harder to accelerate a mass at a greater radius from the centre of rotation than a mass that is closer to it. I don't really understand why that is, and all I see are maths equations that I have an okay grasp of, but what I really can't understand is the physical reality behind this. I wonder if anyone can elucidate this?

I have this idea in my head that, referring again to the two cylinders, the outer rings of both should be accelerating at the same rate, but the solid one accelerates more. Is this interior of the solid cylinder somehow 'pushing' the rest of the cylinder? This has really got me in a bind.

Thank you for your time.

When referring to magnetomotive force we use F, [but the F is stylized in all the literature](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e328be8a42ab68821d9ca5aacfe46063d995992e) and my professor has said that the stylization of the F is important in order to differentiate from other symbols. [Same with R](http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/10235.png) for magnetic reluctance.

So my question is: What do actual physics experts refer to them as? What's their proper name that differentiates them from regular F and R? My professor insists on calling them "Crazy [letter]" because he doesn't know what else to call them, but I'm the type to endlessly pursue the correct answer.

Thanks!
I have a question about water behavior in a pipe:
What would happen if you had a pipe filled with water that went in a loop and heated the bottom of the loop?

Imagine that the pipe starts out at the bottom with a heating element of some sorts attached to it. The pipe then goes up for a bit and then flattens out where the heat is removed again. Then the pipe goes back down to the heating element. Would the water inside start to revolve around the loop?
I have some questions regarding the following problem...

Given:
Angular acceleration = 10 rad/s
Mass of the object = 1 kg
Shaft Radius = 0.1 m
Wheel Radius = 0.3 m

**Object is connected to a string wound around the shaft. Object starts at rest and falls down, causing the shaft and the wheel to rotate with an angular acceleration of 10 rad/s**

A) Asks for linear acceleration. 
😎 Asks for tension in the string.
C) Asks for total moment of inertia of both the shaft and the wheel.

So I got 0.09 kg•m^2 as the answer...

My question is...

1) Is 0.09 the correct answer or should it be 0.18 (I'm too lazy to type in the units, sorry •_•)?

Because if the total moment of inertia of both the shaft and the wheel is as stated, then it means that I(shaft) + I(wheel) = 0.09 kg•m^2.

That can't be true though. Because calculating for I(shaft) alone already yields 0.09kg•m^2 as the answer..(using the same equation)...

The answer given in the solution section says 0.09 though...

But am I correct to think that 0.09 is only for the shaft, and to calculate for I(total) I have to add to 0.09 the value of I(wheel), which is the same as I(shaft) because they are both rotated by the same force, at the same angle, and have the same angular acceleration? Fr=Ia (Same F,r,a angular)

2) When a shaft is connected to a wheel, and they rotate, they have the same angular displacement, velocity, acceleration right?

Sorry for the long question...here's a potato.

(::..)

Before typing this I was unsure...but right now I think I'm correct...the more I type the more it makes sense...


Edit: No, 0.18 doesn't make sense, because Fr = Ia. Fnet = 9. R = 0.1. anet = 10..and 9(0.1) is not equal to (0.18)(10).
As somebody double majoring in Physics and Comp Sci, after talking with many professors and people in the tech industry (albeit, mostly cybersecurity), here's what I have to say. Take it for what you will, what I say is by no means law, and I could be completely wrong.

According to my undergrad research advisor Physics degree is the type of degree people see and will want to hire you. It represents a higher ability of problem-solving, as well as grasping complex concepts. So with a Physics degree alone, you likely have a chance at a job somewhere in the software industry (albeit, if all you have is the degree and zero programming knowledge, that chance is lowered and you will likely be in a lower tier position). Now, if you do have programming knowledge (which it seems like you do, as I would hope any physics major would at this point), this greatly increases your chances. 

Now, it looks like C is the only language you feel that you *know*, though you understand some more in-depth concepts. I would definitely spend some free time learning another language or two before you apply to a job. Look at jobs you want to apply for, see what their requirements are, learn (if reasonable) the languages or concepts that the job is looking for. 

"What if the job posting is vague?" Well, if the ad is truly being that vague, learn some of the more popular languages as of late. You have C knowledge, so learning others (specifically Python and C++) should be much easier than if you were starting from nothing or coming from another language. 

I'm sure there are plenty of much more qualified people in this sub who can give you a better answer, but this is just my 2 cents. Best of luck mate! Comp. Neuroscience would be interesting, but you may want to brush up on some chem!
Feynman is the go to recommendation.  For science look at QED or Six Easy Pieces.  For just a science-themed fun read then Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman.
Here's a website that lists many free science eBooks in a number of fields: http://sciencebooksonline.info

Surely there'll be something there of interest. If you want to give us some specific information about your special areas of interest and other details like whether you're looking for popular books or textbooks etc, someone here can probably give you some specific recommendations.
Susskind's Classical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics are also great reads. However, they require a good deal of mathematical knowledge, which is anyway essential for physics at higher levels. Anyway I am 16 and I got through pretty well.
Paul Hewitt's books :D Conceptual physics is neat, but anything you can get your hands on is great. Feynman isn't bad but it's kinda overkill for your current level in math and Hewitt's approach is fantastic 

> just barely out of resonance

Quick comment, busy day - sounds like a great perturbation problem. You could find a sort of steady state where physical oscillations are at a constant amplitude based on power dissipation (a function of piston displacement as well unfortunately). 

Look up "perturbation methods" for a general idea, but I'll leave it to brighter minds to formulate an actual attempt.
My experience is that there are broadly two types of mathematical physicists.

The first type, probably the majority among people who call themselves mathematical physicists, work on mathematically rigorous formulations of problems in theoretical physics. They use a Theorem/Lemma/Proof construction, applying a mathematical methodology to problems motivated by physics. The goal is to very precisely specify physical problems and derive their solutions without any unstated assumptions, vaguely defined terms, or hand-wavy arguments. Their work usually follows behind the frontier in theoretical physics, justifying and clarifying things that were poorly understood at first. Their work is valuable to mathematicians because frequently their proofs involve novel mathematical tools and ideas. It is valuable to physicists because it removes any ambiguity or dispute about the consequences of a theory, and sometimes discovers subtle errors in what has been previously argued. A prototypical example in this category is John von Neumann. 


The second type are broadly concerned with a sort of opposite approach where the methodology of physics is applied to mathematics. These guys are out there exploring some aspects of mathematics, which they can investigate via example and experiment, but cannot yet generate proofs for. The problems they work on are usually inspired by physics problems, either in the sense that the mathematical structure is physics-adjacent (that is similar to some physics problem, but different in a way not necessarily motivated by physics) or in the sense that they are developing new mathematical tools for theoretical and computational physicists to use. Carl Bender is a good example of this kind of mathematical physicist.

There are physical mathematicians and mathematical physicists. It depends on which identity you identify with more. Pick the academic attitude you prefer, go to that department and then find collaborators in the other one. So if you are a bit fast and loose, you can go to a physics department and then find a math friend who likes a similar problem who can keep you honest.
I think the closest thing to a 'physics mathematician' would be a mathematical physicist. That field deals with developing mathematical tools for use in solving physical problems. For example, finding numerical methods for solving the [Navier-Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) might be something a mathematical physicist deals with.
What is the curriculum?  Surely there's a budget too, right?
Doing some kind of optical alignment with low powered lasers would be fun, and kinda affordable. Kids get to wear safety glasses too.
some of the things i remember from my intro to physics in college that really interested me (which is what i believe the point of an intro course is, after all)

1. double slit experiment

1. using polarizing filters to demonstrate how adding a 3rd filter (at 45 degrees) in-between two completely perpendicular filters can allow more light to pass

1. using a bunch of small compasses to visualize a magnetic field. also, generating a magnetic field with electricity and wires that can be viewed. 
A fun one that we had in our high school was the teacher had built a [Rubens' tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubens%27_tube) to demonstrate standing waves. Fire always adds a dramatic flare to things.
Do a search of some university physics 1 and 2 labs. It costs a lot just to buy the basics; rulers, mass sets, carts, tracks, stopwatches, pulleys. The total cost of setting up a respectable student physics lab from scratch is over $50k. Does the department know this?
have you tried the [Binet equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binet_equation)?
What's your background? If you're familiar with Lagrangian mechanics, turn it into an effective 1-body problem in the radial direction, then just follow the same steps you would for the Kepler problem.
Nothing. I just graduated. (waves to the audience)
Studying the entanglement structure of the KSAT problem through path integral monte carlo for my masters thesis. I am still looking around for some literature, so suggestions are welcome.
I'm a biologist that uses some physics.  I have a lot of data and simulations showing how different physical parameters change how spatial proximity of one bacterial colony to another alters their fitness.  What I've been trying to do for about a month now is figure out some way to combine these parameters into a sort of master parameter.

No real luck yet, especially because there is time-dependence in some of the parameters, and my math background isn't great so I have a great deal of trouble doing non-dimensionalization and other methods of reducing parameter space.
Learning and messing around with [Julia](http://julialang.org/).
Every bloody week for the last few months my answer to this would have been the same - finally I'm writing it all up for my first peer reviewed paper, so next time this thread pops up hopefully there will be a different answer. I'm finding writing the introduction by far the hardest part as I'm confident in the science itself, but not so sure about its context and relevance to the wider field.
After looking at Category Theory for Scientists, I'm finally going over the [Baez](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf) paper and really getting an understanding of braided monoidal categories. It's a surprisingly interesting read, but doesn't go over much physics besides explaining some group theory in quantum mechanics. It's still hard for me to form a connection on why this is useful and how data can back up the structural claims presented in a category theory interpretation, but I'm chugging along.

So far I'm just trying to deal with the overwhelming amount of data, and how almost each individual spectrum needs to be corrected individually, making it hard write an algorithm that's not incredibly slow but still doesn't distort the data too much in the corrections.

? There are two somewhat independent properties, thermal mass (how much juice you have to pump into something to raise its temperature), and thermal conductivity (how quickly("easily") heat flows through something. 

Your question as stated reads like "I am confused, can someone please tell me what question makes sense to ask? It's about heat exchange."
That usually falls in the area of Oceanography and I think there is a limited demand for it;  jobs are mostly gas and oil exploration and field simulation with geologists as far as I know.  What are the few programs specifically you find interesting?
It seems from the context it means "days".

I've never seen it written like that, but in astronomy they write stuff like "19^h 52^m 28.36775^s" for the right ascension of a star.
I have never seen that style of notation before. It seems like this would be defined somewhere earlier in the book. Double check? 
It *may be* a superscript that specifies days, and its position over the decimal point may be a coincidence if the character is meant to appear as a superscript to a value that's to the left of a decimal point. In other words, five days would be indicated as 5^d , but in these examples, the values aren't integers, and the proximity of the superscript and the decimal point may have no special significance.

Just a guess.

Maybe is just a way to express decimal.

Maybe they just wanted the d. I'll show myself out, no need to shove.
Fluid Mechanics by Landau and Lifshitz it is a very nice introduction. You should be able to find it in any university library.
In my opinion,

* Brennen, Christopher E. Cavitation and bubble dynamics. Cambridge University Press, 2013.

There are a few different definitions of matter, one of them being "anything with mass" but a more common one being "anything with mass and volume." According to the first definition yes and the second no. But positrons are generally considered to be antimatter despite lacking volume.
Yes they matter very much 
Engineer here... Carefully?
Optical and radar methods are important for measurements like this. Bragg reflections, Doppler analysis, etc., are active methods. Passive methods involve spectral analysis, often using an interferometer and looking at pressure and temperature broadening and the Doppler shift to determine pressure, temperature, velocity of a target gas volume optical emission. The Voight profile is one tool for this. 
If you know the air pressure, temperature and composition of the atmosphere, you could just calculate it that way.

But since your asking, I'll try to answer. What kind of pressures and temperatures are we talking about? The speed of sound is roughly independent of the medium's pressure, but the volume of it decreases much more rapidly in a low pressure environment. But this question seems to involve more than both of those concepts.
I liked this line: 

>I should however give justice to other experiments that also don't find new physics, often in a spectacular way. 

If the non-detections get pushed down to the neutrino floor, that'll be really impressive from an experimental perspective, but also kind of depressing. I kinda hope it's axions.
What SS model was used to simulate the DM regions of that plot?

MSSM, PMSSM?
If the beings are made entirely of light, the only way for their whole body to move at the speed of light is if all the light moves perfectly parallel, in which case it's not possible for the relative positions of the light rays to change over time. In other words, these beings cannot change over time, which means they can't be sentient or perceive anything. In order for the light to bounce around and do any kind of thinking, it would have to take a zig-zag path that has a lower average speed, in which case the body as a whole would behave like it has mass (in fact, you can roughly think of electrons as zig-zagging around at the speed of light but the average velocity is lower and this is why they have mass, it's called zitterbewegung).

The other answer is that you can't define an inertial frame where light is at rest (it always travels at c), which means travelers at lightspeed can't see spacetime the same way we do, if at all. 
> Do you think some physics problems are incapable of being solved whatsoever, and that humans will only understand a limited fraction of physics?

That might be true, but there's little point in trying to bring such a philosophical topic to any kind of conclusion, because if we can't directly resolve basic physics questions with the powerful tools at our disposal, then it follows that a meta-conversation about the power of physics to resolve important questions is handicapped to a much greater extent.

Put more simply and in my opinion, it's better to explore the theories and evidence directly and see where that takes us, than to try to anticipate how that search might turn out. If instead we try to draw a conclusion at a philosophical remove from a direct engagement with theories and evidence, we put ourselves in the position of a [19th century professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_von_Jolly) who advised the young Max Planck not to pursue a career in physics, saying, "in this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few unimportant holes."
I'm undecided about whether a theory of everything exists. Maybe there are cultural/evolutionary/mathematical (see Godel) reasons why our theories will only ever be able to predict a subset of the phenomena that the universe has to offer. If such a theory is impossible/inaccessible to the human mind, then there is still a lot of fun to be had in learning how to select the right incomplete theory for the job, also in generating still more incomplete theories to be treated as alternatives.

Existence always hogs the spotlight though. What about uniqueness? Suppose that there is such a theory--one that would complete our picture of the world perfectly. Is there any reason to believe that it is unique?  Couldn't there be two theories that are incompatible but that each suffice to describe and predict everything that can be predicted? I think there could be, and that having two equivalently powered but structurally differing theories would be a really neat thing, particularly when it comes to our ability to communicate and teach all this theory stuff.
http://phys.org/news/2015-12-quantum-physics-problem-unsolvable-godel.html


Some problems have been mathematically proven to be unsolvable.
I think our theories will always be incomplete and there will always be unsolved problems, but I also think that we aren't even close to hitting any sort of limit or barrier to our natural capabilities--there's still plenty more to discover using our current techniques. Also, I think that any barriers to our capability could be pushed back considerably using eugenics or artificial intelligence, in the long term. Currently both of those techniques (eugenics and AI) seem incredibly risky and even dangerous; hopefully we will wait until we can implement them benevolently rather than being hasty with them.
I don't think physics will end by any means, but a sustained lack of progress on the fundamental front means that it will likely gradually recede from its spot at the head (or the base, if you want) of the sciences and become one among many again.
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v528/n7581/full/nature16059.html
I am having prolems with the word:"limited". Am I the only one? I apoligize if I state the obvious.
The synergy between theory and experiment is the true philosophical power of modern science. Dirac, Fermi, Higgs all solved existing problems and predicted discoveries by using pure mathematics. So not only were existing problems solved (unification of SR and QM), but predictions were made that could guide future research. 

 Based on comments so far it would seem that these results are trivial and "limited" , this is an ignorant point of view. Of course there are major challenges, and perhaps ultimate knowledge  (physics down to Planck  scales) may be impossible. Since I am not Einstein or Chrandasaqar I find it far more rewarding and useful to learn how we know what we know (I do the math) and thereby understand the basis of outstanding questions.

Also, it's often not understood how seemingly "opposite" perspectives (i.e. particles/ waves) are commonly referred to within the same experiment or model.  The universe decides the context of which theory is more useful in a practical setting. Outsiders seem to focus on how "wrong" Newton limited as it may be it's still good enough to launch probes to the other side of the solar system.

Finally there really are fundamental symmetries in our universe that guide any advanced forms asking similar question as we do. They may use different symbols but the math will be the same. There periodic table will consist of the same elements with same trends.
ALL problems have answers. These answers may escape us for now. There is genius yet unborn that can and eventually will solve all questions and problems. 
The problem is that we cannot know for sure how much there is that we don't know. The amount we know could be a trillionth of what there is to know or even tinier than that. 
But we already have a complete understanding of the physics which effects every day life.  And a significant amount of physics beyond that.

Unification is the last major result.  Is that a small or large fraction of what there is to know?
Perhaps there will always be physics out of reach. For instance, the theoretical ceiling on particle energies, aka Planck mass, will seemingly never be approached. On the other hand I think better computing techniques will help augment human progress and understanding. There has already been success in creating AI that can work on problems in physics. As we get closer to producing artificial general intelligence, it may only be a matter of time before software exceeds our own ability to produce novel solutions. 
I think that slow or long term periodic phenomena, with periods longer than a human lifespan, is our great weakness. But not impossible to overcome!
I dunno, physicists are pretty clever. Even if particles are made of strings, and strings are made of fabrics, and fabrics are made of knots, and knots are made of twists, and so on to smaller and smaller distance scales in an infinite recursion, somebody will probably come up with a meta-theory at some point that explains the recursion itself, allowing you to predict which theory is valid at the nth recursion step.
Really hope we discover what the nature of dark matter is. It is perhaps the most perplexing measurable phenomena we have that currently has no agreed upon mechanism.
People seem to enjoy philosophizing over the intangibles...

In this case, the question is almost anti-scientific.
This is probably an abuse, but wouldn't godel's incompleteness thm say not *everything* could be proved?
I always thought that the humanity will never find the "theory of everything". It seems utopian.
>Do you think some physics problems are incapable of being solved whatsoever

Yes. Mostly ones from science fiction. FTL, other energy sources than we already know, etc etc.

>and that humans will only understand a limited fraction of physics?

Unlikely. The problems will persist because there are limits to what we we can do, and we can see a great deal of the limits already. However, due to the limits of human psychology, we may always be driven to believe there is more, simply because we are easily disappointed with less. So expect religion to gain more adherents as science closes the book on what is possible. Already we see a massive backlash whenever science determines something to be impossible.
If we can create true AI which would subsequently lead to new discoveries then I believe that a theory of everything is possible although I reckon that time is against us on that one. I think the more important question is whether we can figure enough out to save ourselves before we wipe each other out through war or over population. 
There is an inherent asymmetry in the typical states of objects in our Universe. Basically, the microstate of thermodynamic systems you can build will be structured in such a way that evolved in the future S increases, in the past decreases.

When someone tries to bullshit that it can be proven from basic probability theory that entropy must increase you know he's lying, because ultimately the microscopic system should be time-reversal invariant, as you correctly found. It cannot be proven because it's actually not generally true. What actually happens is that in our Universe, the *states* will belong to a particular subset of states for which the second law holds.

And this is all because of context. Our Universe happens to have two time endpoints with different entropy. Therefore S will increase from the minimum to the maximum. This will induce that particular property in the states of subsystems of the Universe, so that they also will satisfy the second law when isolated.

The correct way to approach this then is to say: assume the initial (Big Bang) and final (heat death, big rip, credits rolling, whatever that is) states are fixed (boundary conditions), then you sample randomly from possible histories of the Universe which satisfy those boundary conditions. What you'll find is that with extremely high probability the typical history will be such that entropy is mostly well defined at most times and it increases monotonically as time flows.
As the table (sorted by date) shows, all the more recent fly-bys did not show any anomaly. The first fly-by of Rosetta in early 2005 was the last one, afterwards we had 4 fly-bys without anomaly, for Hayabusa 2 I didn't find data.

Whatever it was, it is probably gone. And assuming the laws of physics do not change over time, it was probably not a real effect.
A couple of professors at my university developed an alternative theory of EM (that is, special relativity is false) to explain this and the Pioneer anomaly, and one of them gave a talk on it. It was really a sight to behold, some of the top researchers of the department sitting in the front row waiting like lions for the talk to be over so they could demolish the speaker.
Is this more than random link to a physics-related Wikipedia page?
Farscape anyone?
I'm pretty sure this one is now under "solved"

Something to do with differential heat radiation
No. You need a second bachelors degree. You cannot do a graduate degree in physics with a business degree and background. That said, I don't recommend a second bachelors in physics. Electrical Engineering would be a better second bachelors, but if you are more theoretically oriented I wouldn't suggest it either. Also, wanting a masters in physics is weird, especially theoretical physics. It's common for a physicist to spend 4 years in undergrad, then 6 years in grad school, then 4 years post doc, then get a job somewhere and refer to himself as an engineer. 

There is a chance you could get into an applied mathematics graduate program if you spend a couple years preparing, including taking some credits at a community college.

> I'm looking to formally and dramatically improve my physics knowledge

2 years spent learning physics, even as a graduate degree, won't do jack shit. Even if somehow you got into a graduate program and passed, which you wouldn't, you won't be any closer to understanding.

Being a competent engineer or scientist takes more than a decade of school/experience. It's like being a doctor. Some disciplines are more forgiving, but the hardcore ones like physics act like a meat grinder. This isn't something you can put 2 years into and get anything useful out of it. 

If you had a real degree instead of a business degree, something with mathematics in it, you still wouldn't be able to jump into a physics graduate program. That shit is hard. You would need to prepare considerably before applying. You probably wouldn't need a second bachelors, but it would take hundreds of hours. 
An alternative to consider is just self study, since it seems like you're mainly in it for the sake of learning. Pick your favorite "GOOD" school, and look up their undergrad physics curriculum. A lot of them will probably have most of the relevant course materials available online (if you can't find anything you can PM me and I can give you more specific links), and then you can just get the textbooks and study on your own time. You'd probably have a hard time finding a position in a PhD program (though I don't know that for sure), and in the states I don't think physics masters degrees are very common, but textbooks are plentiful and you can go pretty far without formal guidance if you're willing to work through problems on your own.
Skipping a bachelor's is absolutely not an option, only if you already have a bachelor's in mathematics or some form of engineering would that be possible. Anything you do in grad school *directly* builds upon what you learn in undergrad, there is no substitute or 'skipping' that can be done.
Physics Master's degrees are typically not offered in the U.S. because it's not a professional degree that leads to any particular career. You typically apply directly to physics PhD programs after a Bachelor's, and PhDs are research degrees. Most physics jobs require a physics PhD.
Lol
Buy a book on the physics GRE, cry some, then go do something useful with your life instead of all this theoretical bull hockey.
I agree with many other replies that you would need a B.S. in something more closely related to physics (math, chemistry, engineering, etc) if that's really what you want to do. 

Note that it would be *very* difficult to find any program that would consider accepting you with a business degree. If you really think you want to give it a try, it's never too late to go back to school, but know that if you take physics seriously (as one of the other posters stated) it'll be at least 10 years of school. Source: I just defended my Ph.D. and have been in college for 12 years...I am not unique. 

If you *really* want to give grad applications a try, note that you'll need the general GRE ($205), then the physics subject GRE ($150). Take a gander at [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Conquering-Physics-GRE-Yoni-Kahn/dp/1479274631) for some physics subject test preparation. Note that to apply, there will also be application fees (generally ~$25-75), transcript fees (generally free-$25), and you'll have to find people that can write *very* strong letters of recommendation for you. 

TL;DR: If you really want to pursue graduate physics, get a B.S. in physics first (and plan to dedicate at least the next decade exclusively to your studies).
Recently finished my Physics PhD at a top research university, fwiw. 

As others have said, in the US, masters means you didn't finish a PhD program (no standalone masters for physics). There is an enormous amount of material, and absorbing it takes time. Unless you assume that you are significantly smarter than the people who are studying physics, the questions you are asking after a couple years are going to be the questions that every physicist has thought of and learned about already. If you want to ask new questions, you have to go deep down the rabbit hole.

That said, the Feynman lectures on physics (three book series) are a pretty good place to start. If you're dead set on going into the deeper end of the pool, google Kip Thorne's "Applications of Classical Physics". (This is a pretty cool textbook for those who haven't seen it). That would be an appropriate textbook for a "master's level course" in physics, should that exist.
Very charming indeed, prince!
Ms/Sir, thank you very much.

I've already advanced on some of your recommendations (been studying by myself for the past years), and I'm still seriously considering this idea, so every tip is extremely welcomed. Please do not hesitate on recommending how to go on.

Again, thank you very much for taking the time and many congrats for your PhD!
Super cool what a small bit of oil can do to a lake!
Very interesting.  One nitpick - that looks like at least an eighth of a cup (2 tablespoons).  And other issue.  Water is polar and fluid.  Why can it be said the negative head of the oil is attracted to the positive side - what is happening to the negative pole of the water molecules, then?  It doesn't seem necessary to come up with this reason for the spreading of the oil.
You can do it, it's actually a really cool looking intricate pattern and checks out with all observation. The thing that it doesn't offer is an explanation as to why that pattern happens and hinges on the axiom that the earth is the center of everything. The triumph of the keplerian model is that removing this assumption allows observations to be matched by a much simpler mathematical model that Newton would soon go to show could be explained by gravity. Not only was it a simpler and more accurate description of reality, but it also got us over the idea that earth is the center of the universe and that everything is the universe was perfect (i.e. Ptolemys heliocentric description using perfect circles), which has been liberating as far as our ability to describe reality


A picture of the solar system mechanics using earth as the center
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle#/media/File%3ACassini_apparent.jpg


Are you asking if geocentrism could actually be right, or why copernicus was better than ptolemy?
Ptolemy didn't know about gravity. It would be mindbogglingly complicated to devise a model where everything revolves around earth and accounts for gravity. Let alone all the observations that have been made outside the solar-, erm I mean terra-system.
I'll start with question 2. In fact, no particle masses can be calculated in the standard model (SM), the particular QFT that describes the universe at low energies. The masses of all the SM (matter) particles are input parameters, which means they have to be measured experimentally and plugged into the equations. What can be occasionally be done is calculating relationships between the masses of the various particles that should be obeyed if the SM is the right theory.

The first question is a little more involved. For starters, I'll describe the proton. It is a basic fact that the proton is a bound state of three quarks, i.e. inside the proton there are three physical quarks plus some other stuff. It is very natural to ask if the mass of the proton corresponds to the mass of these three quarks. The answer is a resounding no. Setting aside questions of how to define the masses of these light quarks, the summed masses of two up quarks and one down quark amounts to about a few percent of the proton's mass. The rest comes from a different source, namely the stuff holding the three quarks together. The strong force is holding the proton together, I.e. preventing the threes quarks from flying off together. This configuration of quarks and gluons (the things that carry the strong force) has some potential energy. Because E= mc^2, this potential energy is the same as a mass, the mass of the proton. In the same way that a stretched spring weighs more than a relaxed one, the potential energy of this system adds to the masses of the quarks to give the mass of the proton.

This very pretty physical picture is emphatically *not* what is happening with the Higgs, which is a much subtler and quantum phenomenon. Before explaining exactly what's happening, I'd like to first discuss why exactly it's such a subtle question. If we neglect quantum mechanics, the SM becomes a classical field theory, very similar to, but more complicated then, classical electrodynamics. Mathematically, this amounts to a complicated set of partial differential equations, whose input parameters effect the (almost always approximate) solution in controlled manners. 

Once we turn quantum mechanics back on, we have a much more complicated beast. A full, interacting quantum field theory like the SM is an incredibly intricate object, especially when it is strongly coupled. One of the central questions of QFT is how the QFT is related to its classical limit. For the purposes of your question, what we are interested in is how the parameters that control solutions to the quantum theory (things like particle masses) are related to those that control the classical theory. This is a tremendously difficult question, in general. Indeed, we can only rigorously define the very simplest QFTs. For theories like the SM, the best we can do is define them through a long series of hacks.

For our purposes, we'd like to ask, "how is the quantum Higgs mass related to the classical Higgs mass?". On a practical level, this question is answered in perturbation theory, in which we basically expand the quantum theory in a Taylor series around the classical theory. Then the quantum Higgs mass is equal to the classical value plus a bunch of corrections that are proportional to powers of hbar. So we have something like (quantum mass squared) = (classical mass squared) + (something)hbar + (something else)hbar^2 + ... In principle, "the" Higgs mass, i.e. what you measure in an experiment, is equal to this sum. 

(Aside: The "hierarchy problem", in this guise, is the fact that the coefficient of hbar^2 is infinity^2. This is quite generic; in most any perturbation series in QFT, the coefficients are either 0 or infinity. Because there are so many infinities, we've had to figure out how to deal with them. What started as a cheap trick to get around an infinity in an equation has developed into the rich and beautiful theory of the renormalization group. The RG has yielded profound and deep insights to many areas in physics, from particle physics to condensed matter physics. However, the type of infinity in the Higgs mass squared, called a quadratic divergence because it goes as infinity squared, is particularly irritating. This is the hierarchy problem, and attempts to solve it have lead to very many new ideas in theoretical physics. )

So... Does the Higgs mass depend on its interactions with other particles? The answer depends on what exactly you mean by the Higgs mass. If you mean the classical value, then the answer is no. If instead you mean the mass that's measured in particle colliders, i.e. what I've called the quantum mass, then the answer is yes. You can repeat the same story above for any particle you'd like, and they'd all pick up higher order corrections to their masses from interactions with other particles. The reason that it's usually only emphasized for the Higgs is the hierarchy problem i discussed above.

Hopefully this is helpful! Feel free to ask any follow up questions you may have. 
Start writing straight away. Write a couple of lines on everything you read, even if you think it's not particularly relevant. And don't worry about your writing not being wonderful on first draft, you'll be rewriting that thing at least a couple of times.

Google scholar is your friend, it's great for finding citations etc. Also check out Mendeley, it organises your research papers and helps with referencing. Good luck.

Edit: a word
One thing that has worked well for me is to start with a small collection of very well focused papers and branch out from the references.   Look up the papers those papers reference as well as those authors' other works.  This helps you go backwards and find the "roots" of your problem.   Then start searching for papers that cite those seminal papers as well as the more current stuff.   This is a good way to get to the bleeding edge of the field. 
Mendeley for sure. And if you haven't heard of LaTeX, which I hope to god you have, get on that ASAP. Actually writing, I can't help much with, as I haven't done one myself.
I was a chemical engineering grad but had to write lit reviews throughout grad school for my own research and when I was asked to review other papers. 

Here's something totally corny that worked for me; a mind map! I would actually draw out on a large A3 or A2 paper starting from a central theme how one idea lead to another with all the different branches. Under each idea I would have a symbol linking to the paper (I came up with elaborate legend/key systems you would only laugh at). This way if I wanted to pursue a certain research direction I had a general sense of how things looked. I still have them a decade or so later!

Tracking references in that mind map has now been obviated with the million software that exist but it was good to actually write it down. The hard part especially when you're writing your paper/thesis or something was not knowing some obscure factoid about your research that you now know is obvious after years of using it but to know what's a good paper to actually reference it against. 

And like the other person said, write, write, write! Lit reviews can be numbing at times and when you write you have some semblance of progress instead of reading 20 papers and going, "now i know all these things, but I have to actually start now".

All the best!

Do you have something against using Griffiths? 
Any increased length on the strings due to thermal expansion will reduce the elastic response of the shuttle cock against the strings. It's possible that some of the additional thermal energy may be transferred to the shuttle cock at the point of impact but with the tension of the strings distributed across all strings the additional energy transfer would be minute compared to the losses incurred across all strings.
I know that the preprint paper you mentioned (arXiv:1404.1207 [gr-qc]) was published in Physical Review D (89, 083510 <2014>) and was reviewed by astrophysics professor Brian Koberlein [here](https://briankoberlein.com/2014/04/13/money-nothing/).  It was also cited by other later papers, see [here](https://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=refersto%3Arecid%3A1288688).  It was also reviewed [here](https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/a-mathematical-proof-that-the-universe-could-have-formed-spontaneously-from-nothing-ed7ed0f304a3). That's all I know about it. I hope others have more information.

As far as what some more recent work is: earlier in 2016, Steffen Gielen and Neil Turok wrote a paper about a bounce model where the universe passes through a big crunch-type singularity. See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.00699v3.pdf  There's a video of a presentation about it  at http://pirsa.org/displayFlash.php?id=16060063

> Mathematicians are flummoxed.

I have a feeling a mathematician might characterize the situation a bit differently.

> the answer lies in the regime of physics rather than mathematics.

I thought physics was just applied mathematics?

Neural networks can be expressed in pure mathematical terms, and don't have to be modelling any physical phenomenon, so saying that the explanation for them is in physics seems like a physicist falling prey to any specialist's natural predilection for relating everything to their specialty.

> there can be 256^1000000 possible images, and for each one it is necessary to compute whether it shows a cat or dog. And yet neural networks, with merely thousands or millions of parameters, somehow manage this classification task with ease.

This is not a fair characterization.  Each of the parameters in a neural network is applied to each element of an input, leading to a combinatorial relation.  That, in fact, is why it works.

A picture could represent an essentially unlimited number of things, yet is only made of a few million elements.  This is not a deep insight.

If I were going to relate neural networks to physics, I would probably nominate the holographic principle.  If you make a hologram of a scene and then cover any half of it up, you still see the entire scene with half the resolution.  Thus it's clear that all the information present is spread out across the individual elements, but inspecting any element doesn't reveal anything interesting.  If you look at even a small fraction of the elements, though, you can still make out a three-dimensional scene from an essentially unlimited number of angles, far more than one might naively expect to be encoded in such a small amount of information.

Not surprised at all to see the paper relate this topic (particularly layering) to renormalization group procedures -- which would clearly have relevance when it comes to describing the same data at different scales and relating the parameters that describe it at each scale.  The exploration/conclusion that layered networks cannot be accurately approximated by flat networks seems to be begging the suggestion that analyzing what the data looks like at different scales is integral to deciphering what laws/functions govern the data.

Very cool paper!

A simple experiment to setup to gain experience working with SDR data: Use it to tune to a known satellite passing overhead- weather satellites are common and use frequencies that any RTL-SDR should be able to receive- and as it passes overhead record the power spectrum across the band vs. time - you will see the signal shifts in frequency as it passes overhead- this is the doppler shift.  using the delta in frequency and a little math should should be able to figure out how fast the satellite was moving relative to you.  Try and figure it out, and then compare with the listed orbital velocity of the satellite in a catalog/tracking program.  See how close you get.

Also, you can actually decode NOAA weather satellite signals yourself to get the pictures from the satellite- but you will need a tuned, circularly polarized antenna to receive them strong enough to decode the data.  One can be made inexpensively out of coax and some pvc pipe.  I'll let you ponder on why the antenna needs to be circularly polarized.... 
Just a note, if you go into physics for nuclear fusion, you will probably be studying plasma physics so I've listed some useful books. Another route for supporting nuclear fusion research is material science because the plasma-wall interactions are important for fusion energy. Another approach is condensed matter research.. specifically into superconductors in my uncreative mind (but I'm sure there are other ways to support fusion work) because you need to confine that shit. There are probably a lot more ways to support fusion research so don't this as the final word.

Fusion is a lot closer than most of the main stream analysts currently believe. 
Fusion from the engineering side perhaps does not get as much publicity, but many fusion jobs in funded projects have a lot of engineering content. It may actually be easier to get your first position if you have a math or engineering focus (only so many physics professionals get hired, even in really large fusion programs).



folks over at r/GetMotivated might like this too.
I'm confused. I thought grad school was a combination of a MSc and a PhD. But you said you defended your Master's?
I agree with everything you say, except I'm surprised by "Classes matter in so far as you pass".  In my experience in an MS program, I was repeatedly told (by faculty and peers) that in grad school an A is an A, a B is a C, and a C is an F.  This may have been more related to grants (C students might lose funding), but I found grad school grade pressure to be much more strict than undergrad — even at the same institution.

Much appreciated. Good to know about the substitutions 
Reading stuff like this makes me sad I didn't stick with Physics or ME. Don't get me wrong, I love Computer Science too, but it doesn't feel as exhilarating. Right now, anyway. I'm still an undergrad haha.

We find no excess stellar motion consistent with MOND and constrain the post-Newtonian parameter to 0.0003 ± 0.001.

This is wrong. Nearly every physicist expected it to be a fluctuation or error of some kind.

Both ATLAS and CMS observed a few more events than expected, but not significantly more (~2.5 sigma in a naive combination).

2.4 and 3.1 do not differ by a factor of 2, but taking the ratio of observed to expected exclusion limit does not make sense anyway.

>In the Standard Model, Gravity is seen as one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with the Strong & Weak Nuclear forces, and Electromagnetism.

Small correction: the standard model of particle physics doesn't include gravity -- at all.  Historically, gravity has been considered a fundamental force because there was a good classical field theory to describe gravity.

>Now let's bring in Einstein. His Theory of Relativity treats Gravity as an illusion.

Let's not call it an illusion per se -- the curvature of spacetime is considered as *actually* there.  However the inertial motion of objects through curved space is different from the inertial motion we'd expect of objects through flat space.

A better way to phrase it would be to say that classical gravity can be well-modelled as a [fictitious force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force) -- like the centrifugal force -- which is not present in all reference frames and vanishes for locally inertial frames (just as the centrifugal force vanishes in non-rotating frames).  The centrifugal force is "fictitious" because it only appears in rotating reference frames, not in inertial ones.  Similarly, the description of gravity as "fictitious" would be because it only appears in distant reference frames where the curvature is different.  Note that it's the description of gravity as a force (and not as curvature) that is fictitious -- not gravity itself, nor the effects of gravity.  Gravity certainly exists!

>So this got me thinking: if one was to take Einstein literally, and approach gravity as being a true illusion, then the missing graviton makes perfect sense, since it wouldn't exist anyway. But then this could mean that there are only three fundamental forces, not four. As an illusion, gravity would not be one of the fundamental forces, right?

Not exactly, no.  Gravity (that is, the curvature of spacetime) is still a real and fundamental thing.  However the *description* of gravity as a force would make it clear that the described classical force of gravity is a fictitious force that doesn't exist when you take into account the warping of spacetime.

The lack of a graviton would simply mean that the curvature of space is not quantized -- it would not imply that gravity isn't a real force.

Gravity can be well described with effective quantum field theory, and reproduces the predictions of general relativity.  So both descriptions are accurate.  One describes gravity as a real force in a flat spacetime, one describes gravity as a fictitious force in a curved spacetime.  These two different approaches can basically be considered equivalent.  Whether one or the other is the right fundamental description remains an open question, but no matter which one is more fundamental, that doesn't exactly invalidate the other, as it would just be an alternative description.

Effective quantum field theories of gravity stop being predictive at high energies and short distance scales.  General relativity at these scales predicts phenomena such as singularities which are considered to be likely unphysical and just a mathematical artifact that signals a breakdown of the theory.  Neither approach seems terribly promising for describing the gravitational behavior of systems under these extreme conditions.  What we really want is a successful accurate description of gravity in this parameter range -- we want to know the details about how singularities are avoided.  We just don't have a great approach for that yet.

Hope that helps!
The graviton has absolutely no problem with general relativity, it works just fine with it. And then, why would you call gravity an illusion? Just because it can be described as a spacetime curvature? Electromagnetism can be described as [curvature of a line bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_descriptions_of_the_electromagnetic_field#Classical_electrodynamics_as_the_curvature_of_a_line_bundle), but you wouldn't call it an illusion, right? It is entirely possible that one day we will find a description of gravity that looks like the gauge theories we have for the weak, strong and electromagnetic interactions and still can, on a big scale, be described by spacetime curvature. This is not mutually exclusive.
It's possible to unite gravity with electromagentism through [Kaluza-Klein theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory). This strongly implies that gravity and electromagnetism must be the same 'kind' of force. This means that if gravity is not a fundamental force, then electromagnetism is also not a fundamental force.
I don't want to get into the corrections others have put forward. 

But to address your main question, yes but most likely not.

If gravity is not a fundamental force, it must be a derivative force of something else.

Wich brings us to three possibilities:

1. It is a derivative of some new unknown force.

1. It is the derivative of one or more of the two forces we already have

1. Combination of one or more of the two forces we already have + some unknown force


If it is 1., then we didn't really do anything substantial AFAIK    

If it is 2., I think the best candidate would be some long distance mechanism with the Higgs, but considering that it is massive it would be in a contradiction with the speed of gravity

If it is 3., I am having a hard time figuring out an example to demonstrate how it could work, but it is a more complicated version of 2.



Going back to 2., whether gravity is or isn't a fundamental force, the effect will need to be propagated via a massless boson. The only two massless bosons that we know of, are the photon and the Gluon. One is confined, and another has nothing to do with gravity. It would seem some new boson is required anyway, and in this case, we over complicated the physics of the problem.
> Is it possible gravity is NOT a "fundamental force"?

Gravity is not a force at all -- it results from the non-Euclidean geometry of four-dimensional spacetime. It only appears to be a force.

> Now let's bring in Einstein. His Theory of Relativity treats Gravity as an illusion.

No, Einstein treats gravity  as a consequence of the interplay between spacetime and mass. He doesn't regard it as an illusion, unless by "illusion" you mean as an illusory force.

> So this got me thinking: if one was to take Einstein literally, and approach gravity as being a true illusion ...

Now your argument relies on a false premise, that Einstein regarded gravity as an illusion.

The problem with gravity is that it's incompatible with quantum theories, and quantum theories are very well-supported. This is an unsolved problem in physics.
Yeah but it's like... clearly there. Jump off the ground right now.
I would bet. Are you going to touch on a theoretical analysis as well? (I know it might be much for high school level.) You could start off with studying the bounce of the ball without water, either empirically or theoretically by using the elastic deformation of the ball. And then add the water back in, account for drag forces and water surface tension.
It depends on what you mean by essay. If you're willing to do a bunch of measurements of dropping the ball at varying heights both with and without water, and then discuss what you're seeing and why it's happening (preferably with a bit of math to back up your statements, see the guy above me) then you probably have something. 

This sounds like it's probably an assignment of some sort, so it's worth running the idea by the teacher just to confirm its within the scope of the assignment. 
I think the effect will be to lower the bounce height, If you do end up done the experiments, pls post the data, curious to see the results. 
RemindMe! 3 days 
Pretty cool.  I did something very similar to this in undergrad for research in perovskite heterostructures.

Is there a way to snap to a certain energy level, or do you just have to slide the bar until you find a smooth solution?
Why not just let non-solutions diverge off one end?  It's much more obvious than searching for a kink.
I really like the idea, and it looks great!

I think the pattern between the energy eigenvalues for each potential function would be a lot clearer if the bottom of each well was at zero. For example, the bottom of the harmonic oscillator is at E = 0.2, and the bottom of the infinite square well is at E = 0.25, which is somewhat non-standard.

It would also be nice if you could input different energies manually to make it easier to find the energy eigenstates more precisely.

Nevertheless great work! This would have been very nice to have when I was first learning this stuff.
I cannot draw the potential. I am using firefox.
Internet explore it works.
That's crazy 
Just curious, is there a physical reason that the kink is always on the right rather than the left (given the symmetry)? Or just it had to be somewhere? Love the tool by the way, very cool.
Tooltips over the icons, or a legend, would help explain what things are. It's not clear what phi is. Also the rotation sensitivity is too high, perhaps a horizontal scrollbar would give more control.
Okay. I'm impressed. It was cool enough until I realized I could draw my own potential. 
Great place to visit,  I got a awesome tour when I interviewed the holometer team. Most of it is open to the public.
If you live nearby, they offer Saturday morning lectures aimed at high-schoolers. I highly recommend them.
Pretty much what I expected. Not to say it isn't awesome! Just that sci-fi does a pretty good job of imitating real life physics.
"Confirmed the existence of dark matter"
None of the images are loading for me, just huge business insider logos.
Did not expect to see my project supervisor from last year when I clicked this link!
Visiting Fermilab was the first time I ever encountered a bison in real life.  Unfortunately, I never got a chance to taste them.  
That last one looks like a sci-fi set. Awesome.
Fermilab is freaking amazing. I went on a trip there with my physics department in undergrad. The complexity of all the detectors and accelerator components was totally mind-boggling.
Came here for HAL quotes.  
The photos were awesome, maybe with the exception of the horrible HD ones! 
Let me know when we get some real images...
I mean, China has a ginormous money cannon that they wield with reckless abandon.  That's kind of where the US "failed". But apparently Yang is the new Anderson.
> Yang said existing facilities including the Large Hadron Collider contributed little to the increase of human knowledge and was irrelevant to most people’s daily lives.

Bah. The first half of that is false, and the second could be said about Yang's entire career. We do (fundamental particle) physics because we, as a species, want to understand the world we live in. We don't do it to increase our material comforts. If he really thinks research being "irrelevant to most people's lives" is a problem, he'd have done something entirely different with his life.

Edit: more specificity, since some areas of physics do aim to improve our material comfort
Wow it's almost like this guy is entitled to his opinion.  If the project can't survive one crusty old curmudgeon, perhaps the will really isn't there.  
"Another One Bites the Dust"
Damn Free Mesons, they have their hands in everything. 
Ok so what you're talking about is a heat engine.  Thermodynamics requires that for this to work you must reject heat to the environment.  The theoretical maximum efficiency for such a process would be the carnot efficiency:  `[; ${\eta=1-T_{cold}/T_{hot}$;]`  where `[; $T_{cold}$ ;]` is the temperature you are rejecting heat to and `[; $T_{hot}$ ;]` is the temperature you are extracting heat from.  

So that's the maximum efficiency of waste heat recovery that you can get out of a system.  Its not super feasible yet for small engines, but this type of thing is a big deal for power plants.  This is not typically going to add a lot of heat back into the system for a couple reasons:  1. When sources generate heat of higher temperature (higher Temp heat is greater quality, better carnot efficiency and greater feasability) heat is usually the product, not an undesirable.  So you're probably going to see a dramatic reduction in temperature before your unit steps in.  2.  When heat isn't the product, its typically lower temp which makes it very hard to extract work from and typically money available for better design will likely be going to better efficiency in the primary system which will lead to an even lower temperature.

I understand that my answer may seem like I missed the point of your question, as I'm talking about waste heat recovery rather than "cooling" but actually thermodynamically, I promise I didn't.  

Now... there are HVAC systems that act in much the way you are hypothesizing.  They take a zone which requires cooling (like a big server room) and use it to heat another room that needs heating.  ...The temperature range/climate necessary for a building to have this requirement is fairly narrow, but I happen to live in an area where it occasionally is the case and the engineering firm I work for did a project like this a while back.  ...now in that case, efficiency is actually quite high because the waste heat isn't going into usable work, its just being used to heat a room which is a very easy thing to make low quality heat do.

...also mechanical extraction of low temperature heat isn't the only option.  There's a lot of really cool alternatives: Chemical, [straight heat gradient to electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect) and some potentially exotic alternatives.

i am in my first year of studying physics in hope of getting into the field of astronomy/astrophysics. however i have been told by some teachers my degree is catered for the research conducted at my university which does not include any astrophysics projects. so i am wondering if anyone is able to tell me if the subjects i will do over the next 2 years are a good range of subjects to help me get into the field of astrophysics, and will they give me a good understanding of the principles i need to know, or should i move to a university with more of a focus on astrophysics rather than just a general physics major?
the subjects are:
optics, vector calculus, modern physics (focusing on special relativity & quantum mechanics), electromagnetism & modern materials, linear algebra, mechanics, atomic & nuclear physics, physics of quantum matter, thermal & statistical physics, electromagnetic theory & plasma physics
How good is lancaster university? And how good is it in theoretical physics?
How hard is it to get a relevant job after you finish school? I cant imagine it is easy. Also any tips on interning during grad school, and since I want to become and Astrophysicist does going for my doctorates matter, and if so how much?
Not sure if is the right thread, but for anyone in the field of Quantum Information Theory / Q Shannon Theory, could you recommend any possible ideas for a Bachelor thesis? My lecturer specialises in strong converse bounds, but because we want to have a final "result" at the end of the year, we both feel that tackling the problem directly would be far too much for an undergrad.


Any help would be greatly appreciated!
I had a skype interview today for one of the PhD positions I applied for. My presentation and interview went well despite some hindrances.

But damn you skype and damn you shitty internet!
I am getting ready to apply for grad schools. I have my top schools I am aiming for, but its the rest that I need suggestions for. 

I am into mathematical/theoretical physics (but mostly mathematical), and I want to know if anyone has suggestions for universities that might not be brand name universities (like caltech or mit) which still have really interesting research groups.  I am currently at stony brook and am looking for other places along those lines.

The final category I am looking at is physics in nice places, If I cant get into a great physics university, might as well be somewhere beautiful. If any of you have know of physics universities in really nice locations, lemme hear about it.
Hey, I have a question for fellow physicists who either picked career in programming or have friends who did.

Next year I will finish my Masters degree in Physics, I'll do my thesis on Condensed Matter Physics with heavy QM elements (evolution of carriers in semiconductor structures basically). However I don't really want to remain in the Academia, instead I'm looking forward to working in programming industry. I'm especially interested in topics like "deep learning" and "data science" where I could use unique skills and knowledge I acquired during my studies. I know Python and C++ very well as well as Java, C#, Matlab, Fortran etc. I worked with extensive scientific libraries to Python, C++ and Fortran.

My question is, as a MPhys what skills should I still get to find satisfying job? Where to look for high level programming jobs without any official experienced in programming (except classes in my curriculum of course)? How to look for interesting companies I might have never heard before, both in my country and abroad? What are the biggest advantages MPhys will give me in the workplace and how to advertise them? Thanks in advance!
Q: Would an Bachelors in Engineering Physics adequately prepare me for a PhD program in Physics?
I'm currently in a senior in High School who is currently interested in some kind of Aerospace physics career. Right now I'm taking BC Calc and AP physics 1 and 2, but where should I go after that? My uni options right now are pretty much any Texas school. Should I be looking into some kind of internship program to get ahead? Thanks.
I have two semesters to complete and then I will graduate with a BS in Physics. I have no concentration and it has taken me 9 years to complete my studies. I have no internships and by the time I graduate I will have only completed one semester of research. On a scale of 1 to employable, how fucked am I?
I spoke with the graduate advisor today and he told me that I shouldn't waste my time studying to retake the PGRE this October, as my other 'base' qualifications already put me over most thresholds (PGRE: 900; GRE: 170Q/163V/5W; GPA: 3.97)

I think I could improve my score a bit (up to 950, my ideal score) since I didn't study much the first time around, but would you guys agree that he's correct? He says I should just focus on my research and statement(s) of purpose from now on, as they will be my distinguishing factors once I've jumped the hoop with my previous credentials, as opposed to an extra 50 points on my PGRE score
I'm a senior in high school finishing my international baccalaureate diploma and I was wondering if anyone knew if the Niels Bohr institute at Copenhagen university was a good place to study undergrad physics?
I'm a recent graduate with my BS in Physics, and am trying to find out what schools offer graduate programs focused on Gravitational Physics (such as Gravitational Wave Astronomy). Would anyone here have recommendations as to where I should be looking?
Since he had to trade his shoes for a digital scale, expect to see him naked when he comes back with a 100W laser
> Photons of light, they carry energy, therefore they carry mass (E = MC^2 ).

Oh dear.
Very interesting that al this has come about so recently. 

Any good sources for physics history?
I follow the videos, slides and sometimes the papers of physics lectures, talks, conferences, colloquia, etc hosted by universities and institutions. The ones listed below are some of those that overall I thought are among the best. I also follow the web sites of physicists who are of interest (their academic pages, blogs, or professional sites have really good materials - e.g., I earlier today wrote about John Baez [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/51le5n/struggles_with_the_continuum_conclusion/d7cx0x2).  I also closely follow the work of Sean Carroll, Sabine Hossenfelder, Matt Buckley, Matt Strassler, Frank Wilczek, Brian Keating, etc. Like you, I also enjoy reading sections from textbooks and sometimes lecture notes posted online.

We like to think that [our content](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday) fits that happy medium. Written by physicists for physicists, regardless of their specialization.^[1](#z) The print magazine includes three feature articles that include histories of specific events in physics, broad overviews of an area of physics, and deep but accessible dives into narrower areas of physics. The rest of the magazine includes pieces about policy/funding issues and various educational and research facilities, book reviews, obituaries, short looks at recent research publications, and a few other odds and ends. 


[1](#z) - with occasional exception; Wojciech Zurek, [I'm looking at you](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/PT.3.2550)
What field did you end up in, if I may ask?  And what motivated that?
There are some pretty good physics blogs out there. Here are my favorites.

https://backreaction.blogspot.com/

https://4gravitons.wordpress.com/

If you're keen I could give you some spectra to fit...
Every day I read through the titles of new PRL articles. If they are interesting, I read the abstract. If they are *really* interesting, I skim through the paper. This doesn't give me super in-depth knowledge, but it does keep me abreast of what's going on the world of physics outside my area.
I too share your sentiment. I currently find ease by tutoring and trying to learn new things in my own. It helps when I think of a fun project that requires me to learn. 
Youtube channels, reddit, relevant magazines and tears. 
I go over the basic derivations to the limit of my abilities. I have not worked for years due to disabilities but challenge my self to go over and thoroughly understand the details of modern physics to the extent I can solve  problems in  thermodynamics, CM, QM. I also trace the motivations and methods of the Greats.. Additionally, I continually follow and develop my knowledge of astronomy and astrophysics (not my area(s) because this area synthesizes a lot of advanced basic knowledge. Your are privileged to have a modern education (use it or lose ir) Unfortunately it's not like riding a bike.
The Internet can be useful here.

I like to follow projects by their papers and reports and I look for a few well known names.

My primary interest is vision, so I don't go deep diving at CERN or LIGO, but those projects should be understood by all physicists.

Good question.
Thank you for asking the question! 7 years out, and I've been wondering the same!
You're being downvoted because this is a simple question of energy conservation. If the same power is being delivered, all else considered equal (perfect absorption of energy of the room, no way for energy to escape the system, exactly 100W is continuously used, etc, etc) then they have to be the same.
Why could the observed behavior not be caused by a black hole or other source of mass with low or undetectable light emission? 
Is it that "dark matter" and "black holes" are one and the same thing, just way more common/variety of sizes in the universe than we ever suspected before our gravitational lensing techniques got good enough to show it?
[deleted]
Or, there could be Dyson spheres/swarms in those regions :)
Really cool! It's obviously not a formal derivation (as you say yourself), but it gives a nice "intuition" for why the temperature is exactly what it is.
The first time I saw this (from Harlow's lecture notes, I believe) I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
Wait a second, one can extend *any* metric to imaginary time and impose the same periodicity condition. So that would mean that any space-time has a temperature, which obviously cannot be the case.
Hot damn this is incredible. I don't care if it's not perfectly rigorous, it's one of the most beautiful arguments I've ever seen.
Very cool essay. I've never heard of linking temperature to imaginary time, but after seeing Boltzmann's factor and time evolution next to each other, it just clicked "duh!"
Soo...where the fuck is my ice cream?!
I want to understand what I just read, however that simply isn't the case. Fascinating stuff nonetheless.
String theory isn't the only thing theoretical physicists are studying! You might get this impression from popular science shows, but there are many different areas of interest. The university I study physics at has an overview of some of their research here:

http://www.tcqp.fi/research.html

In addition, they study computational materials science and some cosmology. None of them are actually studying string theory. 

Jobs in astrophysics are probably often academic or teaching jobs, but I suppose if you get programming skills you might be able to work in that field too. From what I've heard, many theoretical physicists get employed as analysts for insurance companies and banks here (Finland).
It's a big misconception that physicists only work on string theory. That's a tiny minority.
First of all , "theoretical physics" isn't a field.  Rather there are fields of physics: Polymer Physics (study of plastics and polymers; their properties, phase transitions, formations, etc.), Plasma Physics (studying plasma either for astrophysics, like in stars, or for things like nuclear fusion of more technologically focused things like the nanotechnology etching that is part of manufacturing computer chips, like the kind you're using right now), Particle Physics (this is what you seem to associate with "physics", a small subset work in String Theory), Geophysics, Acoustic Physics, Nuclear Physics, Atomic Molecular Optical (AMO) Physics ,Chemical Physics,  Astrophysics, etc.  In quite the opposite of your assumption, particle physics makes up only about 10% of physics and of those an even tinier fraction work on things like string theory (maybe 2% of physicists).

In reality, the biggest field of physics is called Condensed Matter.  This is a varied field that includes things very close to modern technology like nano-electronics and technology: quantum cascade lasers, graphene transistors, 2D materials, carbon nanotubes, etc.; to more blue sky things like high-temperature superconductors, exotic phases of magnetism, exotic quasi-particles, Bose-Einstein Condensates, etc.

Within each discipline a physicist then has more or less oneof three "tool-kits": theory, experiment or computation (and in astronomy there's observationalists).  So no one studies "theoretical physics", that's something Hollywood made up, but rather you may be a Theoretical Polymer Physicist, or Experimental Particle Physicist or Computational Condensed Matter Physicist, etc.

So a career in physics involves picking a tool-box (theory, experiment, computation) and a topic (particle, condensed matter, quantum information, acoustic, etc.)

An experimental condensed matter physicist with a specialization in emerging devices is WAY more employable than an astrophysicist, however a computational astrophysicist should specializes a lot in fluid computation is WAY more employable than a string theorist (well actually pretty much everyone is more employable than a strign theorist)
Im thinking twice because most people that study theoretical physics get hired in insurance ,etc.  more than in the actual research ( theoretical physicist )
I thought I wanted to do astro when in high school, and had the option of moving interstate to do a BSc. majoring in astrophysics, or staying put and doing a general physics BSc. over a wide range of topics. Out of laziness I chose the latter, and in hindsight it was a very good decision, as I found that I didn't like astrophysics *that* much (even though I took cosmology and GR during my MSc.). In doing the more general course I found something that I was actually really interested in, and I had options for further study in a number of areas.

I think undergrad physics should be as general as possible, so that you get a sample of everything. Only then can you figure out what you like. 
An astronomy/astrophysics degree is basically a physics degree with a few extra courses and maybe some substitutions. You really start to focus in grad school.

All of those courses look important for a foundation in astrophysics, with the possible exception of "physics of quantum matter" which is a bit vague.

If possible it would be good to get some summer experience somewhere with astrophysics research.

This all sounds fine. Honestly the biggest resume builder is getting some undergrad research experience, even if it's not in astro, and taking some astro courses.  Grad schools aren't so focused on the exact course content provided it's a fairly typical physics education.
Since a structural size for the electron would be detectable as a high-energy deviation from standard model scattering cross-sections, the experimental upper limit should be about the length corresponding to maximum energies probed in lepton colliders, I'd say 10^(-20) to 10^(-22) m. This is because the SM models the electron with a local field theory which is equivalent to it being pointlike.

However, given this measurement it's actually stupendously unlikely the electron is a composite object smaller than this experimental limit, because it would need to be made from subcomponents incredibly more massive than itself whose mass is then magically canceled by their negative binding energy to give the half a MeV electron mass. There is a finetuning problem.

Other system in which the electron is extended but not literally composite (e.g. string theories) can bypass this problem.
At the moment we consider the electron to be a point particle, with no meaningful radius.

Last I've heard, the upper bound was something like 10^(-22) m.
There are no particles, only excitations in fields.
You can get really far . (e.g. understand chemistry) by treating the electron as a wave (usually) and thereby assume a radius derived by solving Shroedinger 's eq. .In a practical sense, then,the radius is the approximate dimension of atomic and molecular orbitals. Hard core particle physicists and the string crowd may disagree but 0.53 10^10 m is a great, useful result.  The interaction of radiation and matter and the chemical reactivity of molecular/atomic species is usefully understood by the time-independent wave view of the electrons. I understand that, fundamentally,   it's a point particle but my chemistry background firmly dates my conception of the electrons to that of Pauling et al...It's all waves dude..
At the conclusion of this series "about the problems with theories of physics that arise from assuming that spacetime is a continuum", I'd like to say a few words in tribute to John Baez, a mathematical physicst who is a remarkable figure and a very prolific writer in the field.

The wide range of his work is clearly evident from his [home page at UCR](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/).

He also authors the [Azimuth blog](http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com) and is one of the regulars at [The n-Category Cafe](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/)

He writes a lot of [PhysicsForums articles](http://www.physicsforums.com/insights/author/john-baez/)

He particpated in the [Original Usenet Physics FAQ](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/index.html) and is one of the hosts of it (I believe he is no longer active in maintaining it).

He has a regular presence on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/johncarlosbaez) and [Google+](http://plus.google.com/117663015413546257905)

You've probably heard about his [Crackpot Index](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html)

Here's an [two-part interview of him](http://www.physicsforums.com/insights/interview-mathematical-physicist-john-baez-part-1/)

The above is just some of the stuff he is involved in. If interested, there's a lot more at his [UCR home page](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/). There's a lot there but I especially recommend checking out his [Fun Stuff](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/FUN.html), his [Serious Stuff](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/SERIOUS.html), and his [Talks](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TALKS.html) and [Seminars](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/QG.html)




Wonderful series! 
Sometimes instead of doing all the algebra or smaller steps, I write a summary of the idea then write major lines. It really helps when my writing is a bit behind, and let's me focus on the concepts and ideas rather than gritty details (those I save for sitting down by myself).
keeping up with copying shouldn't prevent you from actively following the lecture. other than that you should note things said that aren't obvious . sometimes you are busy with details and miss catching the general idea.
Try not to copy word for word. You could also write yourself notes on how you got to a certain step ( I think these are called asides)
I really only view lecture time as a chance to be introduced to the topic by someone else. I skim the chapter, go to class, then actually learn the stuff while doing problem sets and referencing the book or online lecture notes(not necessarily from a professor at my school. Lots of resources online) I don't even try to take notes in class and I feel like I get a lot more out of the lecture. 
Interesting read. I just discovered the Cavendish experiment last night, when fact-checking a conspiracy claim that gravity was a lie. I wasn't aware that the constant was so inaccurate, relative to others. 

Would gravitational wave research possibly inform a more accurate measurement? Also, if G varied (as the article seemed to imply as a possibility), wouldn't that be obviously observable in various long-distance measurements? For instance, wouldn't the speed of any long-term, long-distance crafts like New Horizons vary considerably as G did? 
The dark ages of the universe were nearing their end 700 million years after the Big Bang, which is 150 million years later than previous measurements indicated.
Checkmate atheists!
You heard it here first, boys! Young earth theory was correct all along.
Just when I thought I had a vague and dim understanding of what was supposed to be going on, they throw this curve-ball! *shakes fist


Dear god this comment section...

It's because "spin" is an **awful** term we use to shorten "intrinsic angular momentum." None of these teeny, quantum particles (bosons or fermions) are actually "spinning" like a top. 
[removed]
Also, it falls out of Dirac but my tiny brain (I am a chemist) takes his result on faith. I understand the necessary symmetry be tween time and space. Why the Dirac equation. eq. Is so different (compared to Shroedinger) due to taking one more derivative  with respect to time and removing electrostatic potential baffles me. Apparently, Fermi,Dirac and Pauli did not get lost on the way to spinors and such. Got to tip my hat to Dirac, he was truly badass.  
This is an excellent question.

However, is it meaningful for photons to have intrinsic angular momentum without time? Is "momentum" even the correct concept to use here?
I mostly agree with you: I think the trouble is with the word 'experience' not the word time. It experiences 'time' in the sense that, depending on your choice of co-ordinates, its co-ordinate time generally changes along its trajectory. But I have no idea what it would mean for a photon to 'experience' or *feel* proper time (which by definition is the time observers notice passing for them), because it doesn't even have a well-defined frame of reference. It's a contextual lie to say that it doesn't experience time passing at all, because more accurately what we're trying to say is 'there's no way to describe what an object moving at c "observes", if it even makes sense to say that it does'.
in a nutshell because we measured it. 
The answer is a modification of the question.

A photon's spin cannot change because it doesn't experience time (because it travels at the speed of causality).

Comparatively, particles like electrons can evolve over time. The fact that a spin up electron can become a spin down electron shows that it does experience time.
Reference frames. A photon itself doesn't experience time, but we do. And we're the ones doing the measuring.
If it did experience time, it'd propagate at below 'c'. Then it'd be possible for you to overtake it and see it's helicity reversed. 
The answer to that question can be understood when you internalize the fact that what we perceive as time is an emergent property of quantum mechanical spin! Ergo photons are simply the force carrier that alters an object's spin and thus the concept of time is meaningless for a photon.

I'm ashamed that the other paragraph about "photon's frame of reference" got so many votes.
does it have spin? or just orientation, for example, my lcd filters unpolarized light, but that light is just oriented a specific way, it isn't rotating, or rather:
  
light does not twirl?
  
edit: ?
  
or are we speaking locally to the photon, irrespective of its wave orientation, (is that even possible?)
What makes you think that light does not experience time? And what do time and spin have to do with each other?
Yes.

Whether you get money or credit for it, that depends on what programs are in place with your college and the university. But there are opportunities; you might have to seek them out.

I've had students work for me from local CEGEPs (a college-type thingy in Quebec).
I think it would depend of both schools'policies and the department you want to research in.
While there are no restrictions on doing this, at least not to my knowledge, it really depends on the professor. Usually the professor or researcher is the one who makes the time to conduct a research project with undergraduates, as opposed to lab PIs or working in a lab in general, so it's entirely up to them.

However, if you send a professor an email explaining your drive to do research and show them that you're knowledgable in their subject, I would say that your chances are good.

Good luck and keep us updated!
Oh, I wondered what [this tweet](https://twitter.com/CERNpress/status/773509832485769216) was about
He's correct. You have to think of it in terms of charge and current rather than what's physically moving. 

Edit: you don't have to, but it might help. 
You're correct that electrons would be moving onto the spheres from the ground. However, since the question explicitly asked for the sign of the charge transferred to the ground, you would need to add that from the point of view of an observer, electrons moving onto the spheres would look the same as some positive charge moving from the spheres to the ground. 

I suspect that the question is still assuming an earlier stage of knowledge, where we know that charge exists (and that we deal with signed charges), but haven't yet decided that electrons and ions are the particles that we're interested in (never mind dissecting these ions into their individual pieces). It's worth noting that in condensed matter (specifically if you're discussing semiconductors), positive 'holes' are treated as (quasi)particles in their own right, following the general principle that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, you might as well treat it like a duck. With that in mind, focusing too carefully on the motion of the electrons and ignoring the apparent motion of the vacancies they leave behind might be problematic for future courses.
Charge and electrons aren't the same thing. Technically, holes would be moving from the ball to the ground.
Charge, like electrical current, is an abstract concept, separated from the behavior of individual charge carriers, not all of which are electrons.
Dissenting opinion here. I personally would say go physics. I ditched engineering early on for physics. Someone once described to me physics as the liberal arts of science subjects (many schools categorize their undergrad physics degrees as BAs in the United States).

While an undergraduate degree in engineering will do a good job of setting you up to be a skilled worker (I like to think of it as modern, educated blue collar), I believe a solid physics education will benefit you more as a person by developing better your ability to think critically, problem solve, and reason.

The biggest reason I dropped engineering for physics? The lack of answering the "why." My physics education did a much better job of this.

The downside to studying physics is it doesn't set you up for a job if all you do is the bare minimum. If you want to just do schoolwork and one or two internships and be able to find gainful employment, engineering would definitely be the better route. I made the most of my physics education and coupled it with a great leadership development program. Before graduation I was presented with opportunities not just in the STEM field, but also finance, business, and consulting.

I ultimately chose to go the "let's wake up at an ungodly hour everyday" route straight out of college because it's something I've always wanted to do, and I figured that four years wasn't too bad. Plus, getting one shot to do [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=green+beret&espv=2&biw=1920&bih=973&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH5sKVooHPAhXQCD4KHdQ2DhkQ_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&q=army+special+forces+halo&imgrc=mhEE9pmIRjZAWM%3A) was incentive enough.

Next step? Who knows? I believe my choice to study physics has opened many, many doors for me.
I'd say go for Aerospace engineering. Like you said, getting a PhD requires a lot of effort and commitment, and if working in physics sounds boring to you, then you probably won't have the motivation to finish your studies. 

Engineering should be the ideal choice for you since you like creating things, and it also has the physical component in it, so you would learn some physics along the way without the commitment of dedicating yourself entirely to the field.

>But I realize it's really hard to get a job at NASA, Boeing or SpaceX

That's true, it's not that easy to get a job at big names like NASA or SpaceX, but if some people have done it, then so can you. Work hard, enjoy yourself and (pretty much) anything is possible. The sky is no longer the limit, friend.
Go for aerospace. You'll have to go into the industry anyway if you don't want to be living on ramen for the rest of your life and you might as well get a head start by getting an engineering degree.
TIL a computer scientist is a programmer.
I would never say getting a degree in cs is useless. It's one of the best degrees to get if you are looking for a job in programming. Computer scientists are never hurting for work. You might actually be more likely to get a job in the space industry with a cs degree than aero lol
You have amazing qualifications. Don't let the fact that you specialize currently in something unrelated to their company make you feel like you're not up to snuff. You need to sell yourself as a problem solver and a critical thinker with a vast array of mathematics skills as well as research skills and team working skills. Describe to them how you can quickly learn their systems and how to be efficient in their work environment, and then explain that your background brings an extra level of ingenuity that focused engineers are missing.
The pion is a scalar and so the final spins must be opposite. Then you can see the final helicities must be equal.

If the mass of the lepton is zero, then helicity = chirality, while for the antineutrino, of negligible mass, helicity = - chirality and so one of the particles must have right chirality, but this means the amplitude is zero because the charged weak force only couples to left chirality.

Therefore the decay width must be proportional to a positive power of the lepton mass, hence the suppression of the electron decay channel wrt the muon channel proportional to a power of the electron/muon mass ratio.
Urs Schreiber is one of the founders of [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/), which is a great wiki on mathematics and physics from the (higher) categorical point of view.

Also, Cartan geometry is pretty awesome. If you're interested in it, there's a great book by [R. W. Sharpe](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Geometry-Generalization-Erlangen-Mathematics/dp/0387947329) on this topic.
God, I _really_ need to hear group theory.

If it could exist, how would negative mass behave?
In a recent /r/askscience post there was mentionend that a contracted spring has more mass than an uncontracted one because of E=mc**2. I assume this means rest mass, right? In any way, if anybody has too much time on their hands (even though this might be the wrong subreddit for this), could anybody go a bit deeper into the mathematical derivation of this?
My question is - Why is the detector in a double-slit experiment not considered an "observer"?
Why do electrical and magnetic fields always operate at right angles to each other?

I guess I'm still having trouble with the fact that these two forces are really one unified field/force/thing. (In the current model, are the worlds "field" and "force" even distinct?) If it's only one thing, why do we see it represented in such distinct ways? If it's actually two things, what causes them to interact so closely all the time?

Also, if you want some extra credit, I still have no idea why polarized light doesn't just de-polarize spontaneously just via entropy. Sugar will dissolve spontaneously into water, so why does light collimate and just stay that way?
Why are the inertial rest mass of a body and the gravitational force it exerts on other objects proportional to each other ?


In GR you have the stress energy momentum tensor, and the Einstein tensor. My question is what is a Tensor? I can kind of get a feeling in my mind for the stress energy tensor relating to the gravitational field, and from wikipedia it seems they've got something to do with vectors but once the article uses topological mathematical terms im quickly lost. If someone has an analogy on the level of - for instance - molecules being rearranged in a balloon reflecting high entropy - that'd be just great.
1. Why can we see a star placed 10k lightyears from any position in a 2x2 meter square, let's say. I am in a position, I see a very distant star, I move a little bit and I still see it. I would say that after so much distance, the photon should disperse somehow. Even a laser shot from such a distance would disperse.

2. Can you explain why starting from quantum theory, gravity or general relativity should not exist?

What is the "standard" explanation why massless particle must move at speed of light?

I have "my" way of explaining it but I'd like to know if there are different arguments.

When I studied Special Relativity I somehow never heard explanation by professor. Whether it is because I missed class or something else, I don't know.

 I explained it to myself by using counter example. Suppose that you have massless particle which moves with velocity v<c. Then exists frame of reference in which particle is at rest. And since it has no mass, it should have no energy. Which is contradiction.
I'm a fourth year Mathematical Physics student in Canada, immensely interested in studying field theories (both classical and quantum), but without any real idea where to start. I'm unsure where my graduate studies will take me, and I want to study this stuff "casually," so I'd like an idea of where to start.

As well, since I'm doing a final project this semester, having a background knowledge in field theories may be nice. I was given a possible project talking about vortex solutions, flat directions of scalar potential, gague theory, "supersymmetric theory with zero superpotential," and a lot of other things I've never heard of or only have a faint idea of what's meant.

Any help would be much appreciated! 
Are there any video resources that go into detail for the math behind the second sequence of university physics? (Starting with Electric Fields and Dipoles) 
I am literally dying in class. I passed Physics 1 with flying colors, completely understanding the topics and everything, but I can't even wrap my head around solving Electric fields and dipoles, mathematically and it's the 2nd week of class.

I go to all the classes and recitations. I read the book and all. Usually if I encounter a situation like this I can work it out with outside resources but all of the lectures I am finding online do not go into the math , examples are the Walter Lewin lectures, and bozeman science. They simply explain the concepts.

Thank you very much

Hello r/physics. I have a question that I can't seem to logically figure out without some help. I don't imagine I'm right but I can't find the reasons I'm wrong so help! :) 
I've studied physics in my own time for years but I am attending my first course in it this year. I hope my question is understandable! I'm gonna write a paper for fun and hopefully some extra credit :p 

My question is about the redshift we see when looking at galaxies. All galaxies in all directions are accelerating away from us( expect for the Andromeda which is set to collide with the milky way I believe). Space is thought to be a perfect vacuum and it's really close to one! I looked up and found that their are a "few" atoms per cubic meter. We( humans ) got this information in our solar system so it'd be safe to assume that intergalactic space might be one atom per cubic meter or less. Galaxies we see are hundreds of light years away and one light year contains 9.461*10^15 meters. In that amount of meters, the photons we receive from the galaxies would have encountered atoms at some point right? How do photons interact with singler atoms. If they do interact it'd most likely be hydrogen, helium, lithium , maybe even some metals Fe, Pb but those would be more rare then the already rare interaction of atoms in intergalactic space. Lastly my biggest question with concerning redshift. If the photons we receive from these galaxies have interacted with atoms along their journey to earth. Could this cause the observer(earthlings) to experience galaxies to be more red due to the photons journey having been impeded by some atoms?
I hope that someone can help me! :) 
Working on a project that requires a 250 mV/mm electric field set up. I have a plan on how to get the field, but is there any rough way for me to confirm that it does indeed have a value of approximately 250 mV/mm without needing to buy an expensive electric field meter?

If buying a meter is the only way to get good results, are there any in particular which would be good for something small like this? It'll be two aluminum foil plates about 6.5 cm apart hooked up to a 16.25V power source. I'm really dumb with physics. Thanks in advance to anybody that replies!
Which technological applications were possible after the complete understanding of the wave-particle duality property?
How do I find the graph of velocity if I have the graph of acceleration? Thanks
Is there a limit to how much energy devices that function on the photoelectric effect can take? What if they're taking in really high energy photons? Do there exist alternative methods for dealing with higher energies or will normal devices suffice?

Thanks!

Edit: to be specific, I am referring to photons with energy levels in the range of 100 eV or greater
Hey I would like to ask something to start with and then continue my thoughts.. I have no specific knowledge of this subject. So what does the potential existence of wormholes mean for spacetime? 
What would be the consequences if the speed of light was much slower? Say around the same as the speed of sound.
Could an interstellar probe harness the CMBR as a power source? 


I know it would only be a very, very, very tiny amount of power even if it were possible, and probably a radioactive substance with a very long half-life would be more useful as a power-source in practice. 

But would it be possible at all?
If you have a garden hose pushing out water, it will be pushed around (due to conservation of momentum), preventing it from hanging straight down. But if you put just the tip of that hose in water, all of a sudden it calms down and hangs as if no water is coming out of it. Why does conservation of momentum appear to vanish? Why does the force suddenly vanish?
Why does the relativistic energy formula not work for low speeds?
If the charge is stationary and then starts moving from point A to point B, it would emit radiation. If it is already moving at a constant velocity, it would not. 

Consider that if you were moving at the same constant velocity as the charge, it would appear stationary to you.
If it emitted radiation at constant velocity the laws of physics would not be frame independent. 
Although the question didn't ask about acceleration, I see the issue is showing up in the comments.  In which case this is relevant (bolding mine):

>The relevant questions we consider are: Does a uniformly **accelerated** charge actually radiate? In a constant
gravitational field should free-falling observers detect any radiation emitted by free-falling charges? Is the equivalence principle valid for such situations? If the answer to the first question is affirmative, a free-falling charge will radiate according to an observer at rest, because in a constant gravitational field, any particle should move with uniform acceleration. However, an observer
falling freely with the charge would observe it at rest and no radiation at all. How can this answer be compatible with
an affirmative answer to the first question? Moreover, if the equivalence principle is assumed to be valid, we would
conclude that a charged particle at rest on a table should radiate, because for free-falling inertial observers the particle is accelerating. To explain this puzzle, we need to recognize that the concept of radiation has no absolute meaning,
and that it depends both on the radiation field and the state of
motion of the observer.    
This dependence is the
main conclusion of a celebrated and long debate, exhaustively presented in the recent series of papers by Eriksen and
Grøn,
where the reader can find relevant references.


https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0506049

Is there a more recent paper?
The field of a constant-velocity charged particle does not contain 1/R radiation terms. So there can be no energy propagation to infinity (AKA radiation).
No, roughly, the uniformly moving charged particle carries its electrostatic field with it. (And by the Lorentz transformations, if you are in uniform motion with respect to that charge, you will also measure a magnetic field circulating around that "current".)
I think it's generally recommended that you attend a different institution for your graduate degree, if you're able. In terms of schools, a big part of the application process is making a case for why you would be a good fit for the program. The best way to do this is to find programs with faculty conducting research in areas that you are specifically interested in. Reaching out to those faculty before/during the application process is also not a bad idea. 

Perhaps most importantly, start working on research at your current institution, if you haven't already. Talk to faculty in your department. If your school has the option to do an honors thesis, do it. Since you're a junior this year, you are eligible to apply for REUs (Research Experience for Undergraduates) for next summer. I think a lot of the deadlines will be in March, but it wouldn't hurt to start looking now. At the end of the day, I'd say graduate programs are *most* interested in your research experience, so really take the next couple of years to build up some experience. 
I recommend that you read [What To Do When The Trisector Comes](http://web.mst.edu/~lmhall/WhatToDoWhenTrisectorComes.pdf).

More pragmatically, tell them about [Sabine Hossenfelder's "Talk To A Physicist" service](http://backreaction.blogspot.co.uk/p/talk-to-physicist_27.html). She and her team [have some experience](https://aeon.co/ideas/what-i-learned-as-a-hired-consultant-for-autodidact-physicists):

> The majority of my callers are the ones who seek advice for an idea they’ve tried to formalise, unsuccessfully, often for a long time. [...] The variety of their ideas is bewildering, but these callers have two things in common: they spend an extraordinary amount of time on their theories, and they are frustrated that nobody is interested.

It's pricey though. 50$ for 20 minutes.
Nothing clears that up quite like probing the theory for what its worth. If you're willing, really get into the nitty gritty of their theory and find problems in it or reveal that it comes from poor epistemic practice. OR you find out they're actually a genius who just unified everything! Who knows
I've seen a very similar case first hand (young student, missing class for health reasons, fantastical theory that debunks all of modern science).  He had very severe mental health problems, and would lapse into mania when he neglected to take his meds. In general, he seemed like a bright student and you could not tell from normal conversation that anything was wrong. But in his manic states, he would generate these "crackpot" theories that made perfect sense to him. Mental illness commonly manifests itself at this age, and if you think this could be an issue, you may want  to contact the appropriate college health channels. Explaining to your student about the numerous fallacies in his or her theory will do no good in this case.  If possible, maybe ask his or her friends after class (if they hopefully have some) and casually bring up your student (I haven't seen so-and-so around, do you guys do hw with him?) and see what they say. If it is mental illness, it can be extremely debilitating, and the affected student will likely be unwilling or unable to acknowledge that there is s problem. 

In my personal case, the student was not treated until he was found, injured, wandering around the city with no idea what he was doing our where he was. His bank account had been drained by "friends" that took advantage of his fragile state. Good luck, I hope your case turns out better.
I would email him to explain that it really isn't your field, consequently he should contact someone with expertise in that specific area if he wants feedback. 
I like the description /u/VeryLittle gave.  It's sort of broad but accurate.  If he (she?) is right about your student just being naive it's worth sitting down and talking to them for a while.  I've had this happen to me before, with students and older ( >40 ) people.  And it's true younger students might just be naive about the field.  But for people like that, as others have said, they might be cured by explaining the problems in your field and trying to show where your student's ideas fall short in solving those problems.  There's a something to remember though.  Don't ridicule them outright.  It's true some crackpots won't listen and even go on to misinform others and they might deserve a harsher treatment, but this is a student.  So it's worth actually trying to understand what he or she is says.  Ask questions about their idea.  It not only shows you are listening and trying to understand but it will open them up to being the same toward you, then you can slip in your thoughts on the student's idea and facts about your field.  I read somewhere that this is a general technique you can use to try and convince someone of your point: listen, ask questions, draw them out and make them explain, then when the time is right and you feel you understand what they are saying and they think you understand, start pushing back.

If you care about teaching and good science education this would be worthwhile, even if it is one student.
> How do I deal with such an individual? Can they be saved if I nurture their passionate side until their crank side disappears?

It's very simple. Tell the individual that science requires empirical testability and falsifiability, that untested ideas are assumed to be false, not true (the [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis)) and science relies on an attitude of skepticism, not credulousness.

Explain that scientists assume ideas are false until empirical evidence appears, while a pseudoscientist assumes the opposite -- ideas are true until proven false. This means a pseudoscientist accepts (for example) Bigfoot because Bigfoot has not been proven not to exist. But *Bigfoot cannot be proven not to exist* -- that would require proof of a negative, a logical error.

The above logical argument takes five minutes, and works with everyone except the mentally ill.

Notwithstanding what their positing their theory to be, the fact that you mentioned their health, as well as their paranoia. Do you know what kind of problems they have? Paranoia is often a symptom of a mental health problem, and this student may require a referral to a psychiatrist more than they may require scientific guidance.
When I was a student at Princeton there was a shelf of so-called crackpot books that had been sent to the library in Fine Hall. I used to look at these and was struck how many were reactionary rather than radical; why relativity is bunk, why q.m. is incorrect, why Einstein was wrong, etc. Very few contained truly new ideas. As for dealing with people, I would just enourage them to continue study of conventional science and "it will only help you develop your ideas."
[Send your student here.](https://aeon.co/ideas/what-i-learned-as-a-hired-consultant-for-autodidact-physicists)
That they are taking an introductory course in the field is very positive I think. Perhaps they've built their castle in the air and are now trying to build the foundations for it. As an outsider to various fields I've thought up some products, in my case, as well, and going to school to learn about the related fields to develop it it is I think the sanest thing one can do.

What helps me is trying to break the idea down into its (many) components and trying to develop or disprove those separately.
One thing which I think needs to be emphasized more is that you are _not obligated_ to review personal theories for your students. Your job entails helping them with concepts covered in class, but anything beyond that is up to you.

If you decide to do it, judging by how these things work in physics, there are many different ways it could play out. The student could be genuinely curious about the field, and receptive to critical feedback about their ideas. In that case, yes, you can probably nurture their passionate side, as you said, and teach them something about how research in your field works. Or they could be convinced they've stumbled onto The Truth which is being suppressed by a worldwide conspiracy of scientists, and if you tell them anything less than that their idea is brilliant and groundbreaking, in their mind, you become the embodiment of that worldwide conspiracy. And of course there's a whole spectrum of possible responses in between.

Now, it's very unlikely that this student is so far off the deep end that you put yourself in danger by not praising their theory. That's the extreme end of the spectrum. But the fact that they're worried about someone stealing their theory makes me skeptical that they're in the "receptive to critical feedback" category. I can't be sure. I don't know the person. This is just something you should consider before deciding how to respond to them.
In my experience, crankery arises from a deep need to feel special. Unless this psychological need can be fulfilled in some other way, the crankery will continue.
Seems like you have a few options here, complicated by the fact that the crank in question is a student.
* As an educator, there's a level of duty you have to talk to this student and try to clarify/correct the student's crank theory
* That being said, cranks are a huge pain - you can provide them with all the evidence, all the compelling arguments, all the *logic* you possibly can, but at the end of the day if they are a crank they're definitely not going to accept it :/

As one of my senior colleagues told me when I first asked how to deal with them: "At some point you just need to walk away".
Don't discourage imagination. Our imagination proves we don't know everything! Listening will let their thoughts out and they'll probably start thinking differently once they dig their hole. It's kinda like verbal writing. Some of us need to let it out. Some of us are smart enough to know where these things come from. 
A lot of comments here are quite scathing in their views of young cranks, and even going so far as to call it a mental problem.

I feel that could be unfair. As a teenager I would voraciously read about physics and form my own theories. I even wrote one up once and sent it to Stephen Hawking and Nature! I really wish I had a copy now, since I've completely forgotten it. I know of others who did the same sort of thing. It is just a way of exploring what we are learning, perhaps coupled with dreams of grandeur.

So I'd praise his learning and thinking, but encourage him to learn more and tell him not to expect to publish until he at least has a degree in the subject. He will need that to be able to present it and have it accepted by his peers, which can be hard even when you are a professional and you are right. He'll also need it to determine the theories strengths and weaknesses himself. Getting him to slow down and acknowledge that he won't be getting this year's Nobel prize is probably the most important thing.

If you see errors I guess you can point them out, but I lack enough context to say any more about that.

If you do want to discuss with him about his work then please take this adage for help: People believe in things they understand to be true AND things they don't understand as false.

He (I'm assume it's male) will probably gloss over anything you have to say (because he doesn't understand it) and will hammer his ideas to overpower any objections you have.

In similar situations (that I've been in) I would stay on one topic, even one theorem/idea, and pound away at it until he actually understands it. Then talk about how his work contradicts it. He will never believe his work contradicts anything because the thing it contradicts he doesn't actually understand.

This is from my personal experience. YMMV.
I would be very careful here to determine if the person is, like, actually crazy. As in schizophrenic.

Otherwise I'd treat them like anyone else.
From another reply:

>More pragmatically, tell them about Sabine Hossenfelder's "Talk To A Physicist" service.

I was going to mention this.

You have a specific obligation to help with classwork as a TA, but outside of that, your expertise should be worth something. Maybe this person's a honest to goodness crank, or maybe they're confused about something and they think in their confusion, they've seen something that other people haven't.

At the end of the day, if I were to come to you with a physics paper that touched upon your field and asked you to check my work, I'd expect you to be compensated in some way for it. Tell this person that you have a lot on your plate, and if they're serious about you looking at it, then it will be $X per hour of your earnest work.

tl;dr: as my grandpa said, "If you're good at something, never do it for free."
Just try to be objective. It's your job to educate them on the class they are in, not to change their worldview. Imagine that they just emailed the textbook. If you are well-versed in your field, you should be able to correct any misinterpretations within the scope of this class without making it personal. 
Uuh, thought this was the title of an R/NoSleep story at first. Anyhow this sounds like a bit more delicate and serious than your regular dismissable quantum woo. 
Help... If not a psychologist, can you confront it and have this theory predict something? Science predicts, not just states - the reason for its credibility. 

All the best to you and good on you for caring about this)! 
damn, this comment section is entertaining as hell. love me some "*[+] comment score below threshold*"
check out http://web.mst.edu/%7Elmhall/WhatToDoWhenTrisectorComes.pdf

it is getting popular on /r/math and seems to be related to your problem.
I'd show interest and then as you get to know them and their work, you'll be able to identify if they are crazy/obsessed.
I think depending on how much time you have, trying to explain why their theory and method of obtaining this theory is bs could be the best thing. 

I think its best not to think too much about all the psychological aspects of doing the 'best' thing. Just because its probably impossible and at best you're just trying hard to not hurt thier feelings. 

If it was me then since they're a student and not some random crank off the street you emailed, id try and explain the truth of the situation.  

I think with such crank theories it can be helpful to point out that either their theory is not testable or that it gives no predictions you can measure. 

such as if i postulate that the laws of the universe are actually simply the will of sentient unicorn in a parallel dimension, you could ask well how could we test this ? or assuming this theory is true what does it predict and thus how would we go about measuring this

And then perhaps as they realise that thier theory cannot do any of these things you could point out that this is why its not a scientific theory, and thus useless and thus an arbitrary imagination. 


I always like physics articles like this, simple but really interesting
~~...ignoring all aerodynamic interactions, of course. If you know AT LEAST the velocity of the wind (which isn't uniform and changes based on a bunch of factors), you can maybe guess where the bullet will land. The bullet has a small cross-sectional area with respect to the velocity vector and with respect to any vector orthagonal to the velocity vector, so drag won't be much, but given the distance the bullet travels a small input of force will greatly affect the trajectory.~~

**edit** : Actually they bring this up at the end. Oh well.
From this analysis, you could have the same result by bending forward, and have your body over the center of mass.

But this does not work
It sounds like physics graduate school is _not_ for you.

The Bachelor's should be enough to get you somewhere in industry that you'd rather be.
I haven't had any of your experiences, but I know that depression during undergraduate studies is not uncommon. It sounds like you ought to take a break from physics; if you don't like it anymore, I can't imagine going to graduate school is going to help. But don't fear, it's not like you've wasted your time. Physics bachelor degrees are still among the highest paying bachelor degrees, and that's including people who use their degrees to get jobs in fields completely unrelated to physics. [Highest earning bachelor degrees](http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors?page=22)

So, even if you don't feel all that into physics anymore, don't feel like you've wasted your time; you've definitely made a good investment, even if you don't continue working in physics. 

As for 1), I understand the pain. Physics is very bad at fun facts, because the facts are either incredibly intuitive (did you know that heat flows from hot to cold things!?), or are completely removed from everyday experience. And, in either case, it's very hard to explain the underlying physics concepts without resorting to simplistic analogies which always give people the wrong idea. This is just an unfortunate fact of physics, though. 
I'm a physicist that has been working as an EE for 20+ years, and an adjunct university professor for 9. I've been teaching at grad / undergrad levels and I know what it feels like to want to [quit physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm-4PltMB2A). 

I would suggest you get a job at the tutoring center helping others. You will get some highly needed perspective on how hard it is to first learn a concept, some seriously needed social interaction with other majors, and you will get to realize that you actually know a shit-ton (that is a unit of measure) about a lot of cool things. If you were my student I would let you teach an entire class. 

Best wishes.
I think these are legitimate concerns to some degree, but also the lens which you are looking at everything through is clearly quite dark. 

1) It's true physics has a bad reputation among many young people (especially students of higher ed), but talking about your job is normally poor form in any social situation. I sincerely doubt those other people are more interesting because of their college major. They are probably just better rounded and less jaded individuals.

2) This is an extremely personal thing. The thing to enjoy is the learning and pride that comes with going through all the steps needed to perform a scientifically valid measurement. If you can not find pleasure in that, then I agree that clearly lab work is not for you. However, everyone feels like that sometimes, and, in my experience, stepping away for a while really helped me appreciate my work.

3) This is true to some degree for any knowledge work. But there are sub-fields within physics that are more social. I work on an LHC detector, and there is basically nothing I do alone. Of course, my actual work (mostly coding, reading, and making presentations) is performed by myself, but there are always at least 10-20 people who are interested in what I'm doing. And, again in my experience, if you're a nice person, they are happy to talk. I definitely feel like part of a community. When I was working in quantum information theory however, I felt a lot more isolated... my institution does not have many people working in that field.

4) This is about the same as 2.

5) Women in physics are a rare breed, this is a sad sad truth. And I sincerely agree that not having women around to interact with is quite damaging to the male psyche, and further it tends to make you somewhat awkward and nervous around women, which in turn makes women uncomfortable around you. This is a real problem. But it's not that rare in any field that you will need to find hobbies and connect with women outside of work. As far as other people being boring, I disagree with that, and I would guess you are likely judging books by their cover. Of course most of the people you meet are going to be into physics, if you went into a gym to meet people, you'd find they are likely "mostly into athletics." Your job and your social circle do not need to be one in the same. Finding other hobbies and friends will be an important thing to do regardless of where you work, put your social needs on par with your professional needs.

6) That is learning. It is tough and takes a lot out of you. The thing that makes every physicist special is that they learn to manage that anxiety. Keep those problems with you and don't give up on them. There's no shame in not knowing how to do a problem if you are working to understand what about it is confusing you. If you learn to do that, you will be a very useful individual. 

7) Physics is hard, no one can really keep all the steps to complicated work in their head at once. Further, not everyone is a great teacher, and at the end of the day, you will need to learn how to learn yourself. I will make an aside to mention that when a professor says X is trivial, very often they mean "there's some trick to this that I don't remember." I agree with you that this is a horrible horrible practice and is unbearably discouraging to students. Do not let arrogant people with fragile egos make you think you're stupid. Learn to ask good questions and you will see that the problems you have will stump the professor as well 9 times out of 10. And the other 1/10 times you'll learn something.

8) We do not get such horrible pay for doing a job that gives you such intellectual freedom. Not to mention there are many high paying private industry jobs physicists can hold if they exit academia at any point along their career. Of course your job will not always feel fulfilling, but don't make the mistake to think it's an all-or-nothing sort of deal. Some jobs are more fulfilling than others.

In any case, it's perfectly reasonable to realize this isn't the right career for you. I have wanted to leave physics before and went so far as going on a leave of absence from school to focus on looking for a job. It was a great experience and I eventually realized I had been taking many things I loved about my life for granted. I would definitely not recommend you continue in this field if you think there's something else you'd rather be doing. You're very young, you should be exploring a bit. Physics will always be there if you want to come back.
Wait until you get into the real world, bud. You feel inadequate because you are around incredibly intelligent people doing incredibly difficult mind exercises to produce incredibly non-intuitive scientific results. On the other hand, if you drop out, you may never be intellectually stimulated to that extent again.

Take it from someone who graduated with a degree in Astrophysics and only lasted 6 months in a coffee shop before jumping right back in. You can also talk to my buddy who is mindlessly screening data at google. Get the master's, do something cool. It doesn't even have to be in physics specifically. Think of your master's degree as proof that you can sit down with difficult and nuanced problems and provide good solutions in a fixed time frame.
1. Maybe you are not talking to the right people, physics is interesting, even for non-physics people more or less so then other subjects.

2. I think most students feel that way. 

3. Honestly physics people are not the most outgoing people from what I've seen and looking at myself. But that is not to say that there is no social interactions in physics communities whether in lab groups or the major as a whole, its dependent on us. 

4,5,6. Somethings you can't really help.

7. Weirdly enough the physics department at my school some of the most helpful and enjoyable to learn from. I've only really had that problem you described with math professors, but that just me.

8,9. You seem to be ahead of me from at that point so I can't comment but I do sometimes wonder why physics. I guess its because it's such a wide and varied field that's its hard to stray away from(pragmatically though it's also nice that you can probably bullshit your physics degree to get a programming, engineering, and other non physics but technical jobs, so at worst getting a physics degree doesn't seem like a complete waste). Perhaps try looking into what fueled your drive in the first place or find something to reinvigorate your passion that you might want to continue with your path. 
>Professors/Teachers seem uninterested and are really bad in explaining stuff. I keep hearing stuff like 'oh that's trivial, that's trivial, that's trivial, trivial trivial trivial, i'll skip that'. Everything is 'trivial and easy' to them and they do not seem to understand that it's definately not to their students... Seriously it is not uncommon to have a 2-hour class and 80% of the students, including me walking out: 'Oke I had no idea what he was talking about the last 90 minutes, quess I'll have to study it all by myself at home and hope I understand'. Literally every damn time. And asking the teacher to explain it better never helps as their explanations are often just..bad. They just make you feel dumb and it's frustrating to be honest.

Uggh I remember this.
It's amazing how nearly everyone of these points is the total opposite of my experience. I guess it depends where you live and the university/workplace culture.
I stopped studying physics after I got my bachelors (B.S., USA system). I thought I wasn't as good as others in my class, despite getting good grades, and I didn't want to live the life of an academic. It seemed too isolated, too uncertain, and yeah, too full of a particular type of Asian/white guy. I went into the business world instead and eventually got an MBA.

Now ~10 years after graduating I'm seeing my classmates get professorships and start to gain traction in their careers. Do I regret leaving the field? Sometimes. I still think I would have been unhappy or a failure as an academic, but I have some friends who work mainly on space missions who seem to have a lot of collaboration and diversity in their life. On the other hand, some of my friends doing yet another postdoc are earning 1/3 of what I earned my first year out of school whereas I have a very comfortable lifestyle. Still, there are times when I achingly miss doing science. You get to discover something nobody in the world knew before and that is an *amazing* feeling. It's cool to do business stuff and have immediate tangible impact on the world, but it's not really the same. Plus your math and physics skills atrophy pretty fast if you aren't using them so you spend the rest of your life feeling like you're significantly stupider than you were as an undergraduate.

The thing that stands out as a red flag to me is your #6: if you're going to do physics as a career, you're going to rapidly reach a point where you are the expert on something. Meaning that however much collaboration you do, there's nobody else who knows how to solve the particular problem you're working on. You won't be able to look up answers. This is anxiety-producing for everyone, but to be successful you need to be able to thrive in that kind of environment. If you find this *very* difficult with just problem sets, as opposed to getting stuck usually producing the good kind of frustration that makes you want to learn more, you may not have the temperament for a career in physics. 
Man, I can certainly relate...
I also lost interest /had depression during studies - actually, I was one step away from completely changing my career decision. But in the 3rd year I got a student researcher position at the research reactor in my country. The salary was OK to get through the remaining years of the UNI, however, the experience was priceless and I finally started to love physics again. Now I wouldn´t change my decision for anything. Since as a fresh graduate I had 2+ years of experience in my field, I got an IAEA fellowship after the university and now also ITER fellowship. At the moment I am working on various projects for ITER for EU domestic agency (in the field of neutronics and diagnostics). It wasn´t easy, I gad close to 0 free time during studies, however, when you work on a challenging project I believe it was worth it.
I loved number 4 haha. Our entire class always ranted about experimental error.

My experience with Physics fluctuated with the quality of classmates I had. In my first year I hated it because all the other student in the major really didnt gel with me. Then the next year we had two new student who knocked it out of the park with recruiting new students and the entire class actually became a really close friend group. Yeah 40+ hours a week of word sucks, but it sucks less when there are 4-5 of your friends pulling an all-nighter with you.

And yeah, there's definitely a depression molded in with that, but the degree you'll have is arguably the most valuable BS you can have that tells employers you can critically think and problem solve.


Yeah so my advice would be to try and make friends with some of the other students OR recruit new cooler students OR join another student organization of similar interests to your so you have some social life to look forward to once you get out of class. For me it was a fraternity. Nothing feeds the depressive cycle more than just doing work 24/7 and never having anything to look forward to, even if it's just watching sports with friends one day out of the week.
1) Read some popular physics books (*A Brief History of Time, Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs*) and pick up some talking points from them. Those books are designed to engage the general public, and they work well for that. Do not mention equations when talking to people who do not study physics.

2) You don't need to work in a lab. High Energy and Astro folks generally don't work in labs. Or you can specialize in simulations in any field.

5) Tabletop games + beer will fix that. Have you ever played Munchkins?

7) It sounds like you've had shitty professors. You should pick your upper level classes based on how well respected the professor is among students. That matters more than the subject material. It's a waste of time to take any class with a bad professor; you could just as well read the textbook on your own time. 

I can't argue with your other points. Those are your valid opinions. Talk to your advisor about what career you should prepare for. Consider changing to a comsci or engineering major.

Well so i am in graduate school near completion (couple of years). I dont think i will stay in academics. If you have some time, look into AIP statistics websites. They have a lot of non-academic related jobs stats on various Physics graduates (bachelors, masters, phds) have transitioned into other fields. They have couple of published research as to what skills, as a physicist, helps people who have transitioned to get success at. Studying physics, helps you think in certain way and makes you tackle problem in a different, logical and efficient which is very valuable.                  
 It took me a while, 2-3 years of grad school, to realized few of the points you have pointed out. Partly lack of any break from studies/academic sector is to blame but i am planning to move out of the academic sector as of now. I didnt get any information about other jobs than academics from the reddit/subreddit. But ya bottom line, i am in grad school and i do agree with most of the points you pointed out. There is always a way out, and you dont have to stick with it if you dont want to. Physics provides you various skills which are already to grow in you even before you realize which are very valuable.

Your time learning physics in school will likely only be a shade of your career.

Be careful with your conclusions
As a woman who just received her Bachelor's in Physics, I would like to say that I hope you have the opportunity to switch labs/universities. I saw somewhere that you are a European student so I am unfamiliar with European graduate studies (I am from the US). However, since it sounds like you're stuck working with physics, I hope that you get the chance to experience another atmosphere.

I went to a university where I was surrounded by a multitude of fascinating people who provided me a very fulfilling social life while we struggled through homework sets together and taught each other new concepts. The professors do tend to say that a problem is "trivial," which can be frustrating... however, there are resources out there that you can find to guide you through a neat trick or process to understand the "trivial" parts. It is important that you are able to teach yourself and reinforce the knowledge that you gain by asking questions to which you've given a lot of thought.

Also, if you are able to succinctly describe something that you're working on or which fascinates you, then you can easily get someone who is not focusing on physics to understand what you're saying and why it's a big deal.

One last note: The lab you work in does not have to be so antisocial. I work in a biophysics lab and it's a very social environment. Explore different areas and see what you can find.
I understand your feeling at the moment, it was the same for me one year ago. I took a break and leaved physics for almost 2 months, then I came back. The study of this field can be very frustrating sometimes, as you mentioned : no funfacts, it is difficult to meet interesting students and some teachers are very hard to understand. Today, I'm in my fifth year in college (next year I will start my PhD) and things are getting better. Hope it will be the same for you.
Sorry for my notsogood english, it is not my native language !
I'm entering my last year of undergrad and I'm feeling the exact same way. Like, it was eerie reading this. Don't worry! There are many others like you.
Ooh boy. You should not continue Physics studies. I'm a mathematics student and the issue is basically the same. 

I've had those same thoughts of "I can't talk to anyone about my field" or "No one gives me the accolades I want because no one understands what I do" and for that I took a step back. My love for math overrides every one of those points of contention. 

I can't say the same for you, but it really does sound like Physics is not for you. It seems that you require a great deal of social interaction/social validation that would be lost if you continue down this path. (Note: This may not necessarily be true since in grad school you could potentially make friends who are interested in the same things as you and can give you validation that you need.)

It may be depression you're feeling but I'd venture to say it's stemming from some sort of regret. You have now (will leave) undergrad with a degree that didn't give you what you expected. It sucks. It also makes me wonder why you wanted to study Physics in the first place. 

I would definitely recommend not doing graduate school if you need convincing from other people. If you think you can't do this, don't do this. Your physics degree will not go to waste. Luckily, most people assume physics students are of a particular intelligence (same for math) and you can benefit from that. Having a stem degree will get you a job *somewhere* if academia is not on your plate, currently. 
I did a degree in physics at a small university. Then I took a year off and did a Master's degree in physics.

1. It takes some time to learn how to talk about things. A lot of people are interested in metaphysics. 

2. Lab work was SO interesting. I got to use high vacuum equipment, radioactive isotopes, GaAs, liquid nitrogen. Some of my friends did laser spectroscopy - their lasers were amazing! Others did NMR, but it turns out that that was mostly looking at computer screens. I got to learn so many cool things about computers (e.g. programming Apple II+ in assembly language!)

3. Social interaction: this again will take a few more years for you. You may not have a lot of good interactions with other physics students. Break out of your box. Join a rock climbing club or something.

4. Ah, the results and accomplishments. That was the problem for me. You see I could never get anything reproducible. It was a nightmare. That's why I never went on to do a Ph.D. 

5. ??? don't be so stuck up.

6. Assignments are difficult and challenging. Work together with others instead of thinking of them as boring dolts. If you are not into puzzles and mental challenges, then you're in the wrong field. You should enjoy playing sudoku, chess, go, or other similar things. You should love learning new things, researching things on your own.

7. Yes, this is sometimes true. However, read the text book. Also find a professor who is good and ask him. Get a tutor.   See #6.

8. I got paid quite well when I worked as a T.A. (in Canada). 

###JOBS

If you want a job in physics then you WILL have to do a M.Sc. or Ph.D.   HOWEVER, if you are good at physics and problem solving, and from your post, I'm not at all convinced that you are, then a physics degree has done a great deal to prepare you for a good job in **computer programming.** You will get paid well as a programmer (if you get to be any good). It involves very similar skills to solving physics problems. Many programmers are socially inept so that will be the same as your current situation. But you will have a good job! And if you like learning things, you can enjoy the job, it can take you anywhere.
Damn.  Physics has always been my favorite subject, and I've always been most successful in physics (compared to other classes) as well.  However, I decided to major in biochemistry (I'm a junior now), and always find myself wishing that I had chosen physics.  Reading your complaints makes me feel slightly better about my decision.  Still, I'm considering doing biophysics or something like that for grad school, but I don't know how fun that will be.
MSE in Physics here.

ad 1) Field of study does not make you interesting guy. I'd suggest you finding a hobby or other topic (not necessarily physics related, or maybe something on the physics/philosphy border), about which you can talk freely with your friends.

ad 2) Physics is not always a laboratory. I share your experience, lab work was too demanding, so I chose Computational Physics to be my BSE specialization and Nuclear Physics on MSE. This meant, most of work was data analysis, simulation preparation etc. I was a member of big experiment (ALICE@CERN) which meant collaboration with lot of people. Maybe is this your way to go?

ad 3) Yep, it's just physics. But still, you can do more work which require people interaction, like science popularization.

ad 4) Unfortunately, this is the harsh truth. I think you should try joining bigger experiment, which will force collaboration with other people. Maybe when you will see the bigger picture with the whole team effort this will make you feel better. 

ad 5) How about student circles/organizations? If you have boring people at your faculty try finding people to socialize in other places. PROTIP: In my country, most of female students went to study optics / optical electronics / medical physics. You can always find ladies there. :)

ad 6) That's the way it works! You may not like it, I didn't like it at that time but now I think I learned a lot from this way of studying. This forces your brain to find solutions out of the box and to grasp hard concepts. **This is the most important thing which will you learn during your physics studies.** Physics graduates are valuable on the job market, because of their out of the box thinking and analytical minds. If you're having hard time doing it - practice! Practice, practice and practice! Believe me, practice will make you better at everything.

ad 7) Did you try to ask other students? Did you try to learn in groups? Did you try to ask some PhD candidate about the topic? I remember I was having troubles with some topic from quantum mechanics related with algebra. I asked my electrodynamics professor (because I liked him and he was easy going person which was eager to help) and he explained it to me clearly. Always try other ways!

ad 8) Physicists are not well paid. This is the reason why I left physics (I am software developer now), but I don't regret choosing this field of study. I'd recommend it to anyone, because it is kina eye-opener (hm, maybe mind-opener is better word).

My overall impression is that the reason you lost your interest in physics is your approach. I know that it is easier when there are people around which share your mindset, but nonetheless you shouldn't give up! Try finding people which can help you - you can find them in e.g. the student circles. Try approaching professors with questions. Yes I know that it might be hard, try to make your questions more precise i.e.: instead "I don't understand" ask "How can I get info about this X in Y, how it was derived?" - this will lessen your chances to be put off by a professor. Dig deeper, and deeper, try to understand. I know that it will be hard, it will be depressing but I found the prize at the bottom of this hole most rewarding - satisfaction from understanding hard concepts. This was improving my morale through whole studies. 

Regarding the internship / job, yes the situation will change for better! But beware, there are shitty internships / jobs out there. When you find one - quit and get another. You can be "jumping" between them for a year, two, or three, but don't give up. This is important experience which will allow you to distinguish what is good or bad for you.

If my post sounded offensive, sorry, I didn't mean that. It's just, you need some strong advice, a kick in your butt to get things together, get out of your Chandra and start doing things which will make your life better! Good luck man! You're not alone!
Recently graduated (particle) physics phd here. 

>1) Nobody ever understands or is interested in what I am saying if I bring up >physics in conversations with others. People who studied geology, medicine, >business etc. always do seem to have interesting subjects to bring up.

I actually have the opposite impression. Whenever I am at a party and I mention that I am a particle physicist, people can't stop asking questions.

>2) Laboratory work sucks. You often sit in a dark room without sunshine and >often with a lot of noisy equipment. It's almost never a team-effort as you don't >interact with other people, but just your lab equipment.

Again, my experience is the opposite. Experiments nowadays are getting bigger and bigger and require a lot of (international) team effort. Although of course you some times have to sit down and get your shit (calculation/programming..) done, most of the work consists of talking with other people, even for theoretical physicists.

>3) Social interaction overall is just very low. Preparing an experiment, writing a >report, studying new phenomena, analysing data, creating a model. Most of the >time it's just you doing your own thing.

See question above


>4) Accomplishments don't feel rewarding and aren't interesting on their own. At >the end of a whole experiment, the conclusion could be: 'I cannot measure this >or that phenomena accurate enough with this equipment'. Well... awesome I >quess..yay..

Yeah that's true. Only a very small portion of us will accomplish work that will lead to a Nobel prize. However, being at the very forefront of science is already cool enough for me. And more importantly, this allows me to have a deeper understanding in other (perhaps cooler) results that pop up in magazines.

>5) Uninteresting people to study/work with. Most people seem to have very little >hobbies/student life besides physics. Physics also seems to take a huge chunk >of your time, more than other studies do. Not to mention it's a sausagefest with >in my year 96% of the people being male...

Although they do exist, the physics nerd in the classroom usually doesn't make it far in research. The reason is exactly that modern research needs a lot of communication and nobody is smart enough to do the research on his own, not even this physics nerd without hobbies in your class room. You'll have a lot less of these guys in research, although it still might be a sausage fest. But you can have an interesting job which is a sausage fest, and you have non-sausagy-festy hobbies in the evening?

>6) Studying and finishing assignments is overall just a very frustrating >experience. You often get stuck with no idea what to do to get to the solution. >You often don't understand something at all and if you're not constantly 100% >concentrated you get lost and behind really quickly.

Haha this sounds exactly like my research. If you don't like being confused, it is perhaps better to quit physics now.

>7) Professors/Teachers seem uninterested and are really bad in explaining >stuff. I keep hearing stuff like 'oh that's trivial, that's trivial, that's trivial, trivial >trivial trivial, i'll skip that'. Everything is 'trivial and easy' to them and they do not >seem to understand that it's definately not to their students...

Literally >every damn time. And asking the teacher to explain it better never helps as >their explanations are often just..bad. They just make you feel dumb and it's >frustrating to be honest.

I kinda agree, but I kind of need those lectures to feel modest again. In any case, bad teachers exist. Physics is hard, and everyone has trouble understanding certain stuff. The hard part is not getting demotivated by it, and to be hard and push through it.

>8) At the end of the day you don't even seem to get paid that much for going >through all of this. Afterall that's what a job is for. And more often than not, even >if you love physics, if you are going to do it 40 hours a week you will get bored >of it and you are going to start hating your job.

I have been thinking about switching my physics job that I love for a job with more $$$. Maybe I'll do it at some point later (and preferably before I'm 35), since academia is indeed not a very smart choice carreer-wise. But for now, physics is fun, and the job doesn't feel like the "40 hours a week which will get me bored" like you say.

>9) I think I wrote enough already. I don't even care about money that much (yet) >by the way, so don't believe that's my primary concern in this.

In general, I think you have a slightly wrong image of how research works. I would suggest that you do some kind of 'internship' to see if you like it. 
I have personally had guys and girls like you (and some even still in high school) tag along with me for a day, just to see if they like research and the way of life.

Feel free to pm me OP if you have some specific question

I'm going to be honest; i didn't read all your concerns but i can tell you this.  Science careers especially physics requires a lot of sacrifice. You won't make money, you won't make friends, you won't make much of a difference. But those times that you do are that much greater because you did it with something you love....but if you don't love it then maybe it's not for you. But don't confuse frustration with lack of affection. 
I've almost finished a PhD in Physics. It was the greatest waste of lifetime ever. 

I now work in quantitative finance programming specialized high performance back testing solutions for derivatives which I originally started as a hobby. My current employer didn't care about my degree at all. He hired me when he saw the returns of the strategies I proposed. Nothing of the Physics part in Physics ever helped me at my work. I only need some of the Math I learned in the first two semesters (Linear Algebra, Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, Statistics).

My proposal: Leave! And figure out how to make decent money. The importance of money will immediately occur to you as soon as you don't have any. Keep in mind that Physics on it's own won't make you any money. You almost always will have to switch to some other occupation/field. So, why not do it right away.
Join us astrophysicists/astronomers! We are at average quite nice people and everybody loves stuff about stars, planets, the cosmos and  such.

Most conferences are quite interesting and we have drinks together afterwards.
>Uninteresting people to study/work with. Most people seem to have very little hobbies/student life besides physics. Physics also seems to take a huge chunk of your time, more than other studies do. Not to mention it's a 'sausage fest' with in my year 96% of the people being male...

Really? I have the exact opposite observation for physicists. Almost all physicists I know have a secondary (or two or three or more!) hobbies. One old guy was an avid sailor who would sail in the summers (I was worried he'd die every summer), another is a viola-ist in a quartet, more than a few cartoonists, and so on... while the engineering friends I have are all about how hard engineering was and how hard they party when they are not working (which apparently mostly means loud and terrible music with a lot of liquor until they pass out or throw up). 

And, about the female-to-male ratio, in my undergrad, it was actually pretty even if you counted the whole department, but more like 1:3 when you take away astronomy majors. In grad school.. yeah, that seems about right. It's no engineering though. They get 1 female per 100 males.. or at least it seemed that way to my female engineering friends. 

>People tell me it gets better once I do my Master's (most likely Plasma Physics or Nuclear Fusion Engineering) and get a cool internship/job.

Plasma physics is the best. I don't think nuclear fusion engineering exists though. You might want to look into electrical engineering or materials science if you are thinking of an engineering masters of use to nuclear fusion energy research though. Pls halp! 
I really wanted to list all the reasons your attitude is so terrible, but I can't help thinking I had the same thoughts when I was 21. Being annoyed things don't suit you or fall into place is quite normal but it's also a really shitty attitude. You talk about depression, well that's a root cause of it right there.

Being miserable when you're 21 is horrible, but it's very common, don't focus on the negative thoughts you're having and just sit back and consider the reality whenever your mood goes that way: Do you really think that just doing say medicine, or business (really?) would make you happy? Is that really the problem? If you could talk about physics to be people at parties would everything be fine?

You should continue to apply yourself to the subject, if it doesn't fit it doesn't mean it's a disaster. Be positive if you don't like physics, you tried it, get the degree and look for something different you can use it with. There is a shit load more you can do with a physics degree than any other science degree.

If you don't like everything about the subject then why are you looking to do a masters? If you have time look at different master options, for example, if we're cutting to the chase, medical physics has more women and is more applied than lab based research.

BTW, not that you should be bringing up physics in conversation, but if you can't sound more interesting talking about physics than a geology or business student then you're an idiot.



I'm going through something similar. I transferred schools recently (home university was in a part of the county that was not playing nice with my chronic health issues) and went from a school with really dedicated profs and a small department to a school that ended up having profs who are too busy and don't know how to teach (wish I'd known before I transferred ...). 

I feel lonely and worst of all I feel stupid. For the past few years, I was positive that I would go to grad school for physics with the end goal of getting a Ph.D in physics education (studying both physics and how best to present it to students). That's what all my research is in. That's what I've spent the last several years dedicating myself to. Now I'm dragging myself to class and feeling like there's no point in trying. 

It sounds like your school environment is possibly not so great for your mental health, and I definitely sympathize with that. Personally, I know that I am clinically depressed at the moment. It definitely doesn't help when trying to make life decisions.

The good news is that you can do quite a bit with an undergrad degree in physics - a lot of people don't even get hired to work specifically in a physics field. The way one of my favorite profs put it is that you basically have a degree in problem-solving and many employers love that. You can also go to grad school for plenty of other things. Personally, my own depression and subsequent apathy regarding physics means that physics grad school is out of the question. I want to pursue physics on the side as a hobby that I can learn about and love in my free time. I'll be going to grad school for geosciences instead.

So, ultimately, no, it wasn't a bad decision (IMHO). You can do a lot of non-physics things with that degree and you can even still go to grad school for something different. I hope some of this is helpful!

Edit: I made an incorrect assumption that you were in the Americas ... My apologies! Is it possible to go to grad school for something related but not specifically physics? For example, I chose geosciences because it's been a hobby of mine and I have all the requirements (math and science background is all they require here).

Edit 2: Looking back on your post, it isn't clear if you've done any lab work outside of classes. Class lab work, at least in my own experience, is often tedious and plagued with broken equipment. It isn't at all like working in a real-world lab doing new experiments with a group. If it's possible to work with a professor at your university, you should definitely give it a try. I went out of my way to befriend a new professor who is now my research advisor and connection to most of the other people I know in the department. Knowing people and building connections is very rewarding, as well. 
I suffered from minor depression at the start of my junior year and after I finished my bachelors.  The most I can say is yes, a lot of people in tech are kind of lame.  Find the ones that aren't and fucking stick to them.  It is amazing how much doing work with even another person in the room improves it tremendously.  And working with a study group makes work at least twice as enjoyable and easier.  When your mind gets all tied up in knots, in my experience all it takes to get out is just talking about your problem with another person.  Once you learn how to do it, the knots just slip away.  And plus, the promise that you'll all be up for a drink after a particularly tough set can get you through just about anything.

As for the career stuff, I have more limited experience, but once you start getting internships and seeing stuff from the other side things improve tremendously.  You might not notice it now, but everyone around you is subconciously treating you as if you're headed for academia; suddenly, you're out of that dark, dark world and can see a light that they can't (sorry to any academics here).  People at work are the ones who didn't choose academia, so in my experience they're more interesting (not a lot of women, to be sure, but I'd say you shouldn't be looking for love at your workplace anyways).  And again, if you find a good team to work with, it's a whole other world.  Time flies by.  Tech isn't nice because the pays exceptional, it's great because the pay is really good for an enjoyable, low stress job with minimal prerequisites.

So I guess I got away from my point but it's that a lot of it has to do with the fact that you're in a bad atmosphere, but that atmosphere isn't nearly as pervasive as you perceive it to be, in my experience.
> Uninteresting people to study/work with. Most people seem to have very little hobbies/student life besides physics. Physics also seems to take a huge chunk of your time, more than other studies do. Not to mention it's a sausagefest with in my year 96% of the people being male...

This is because physics is often times such a hugely fascinating subject to its followers/studiers that it is entirely fulfilling. Outsiders call it an imbalanced life, but people that live it do not always agree.

Physics is basically a passion, an obsession for those who are truly good at it. The same is true of mathematics. I believe those two subjects have this effect more than any others.

If you're young, you may still develop this. If you aren't, maybe you're in the wrong field.

It being a 'sausage fest' tells me you are no older than 19 years old, so you really need to do some thinking about your life before you write off a career field because your co-workers aren't hot. Believe me, at 19, I'm sure I had some of those feelings too. You just need to be more mature about this.
Do a postgraduate in something financial maybe?
Honestly it sounds like you aren't that interested in it. You could always switch to math and become a hedge fund quant. 
I'm currently a student in a master degree in nuclear physics, I've felt the same after my 3rd year... I've hesitate a lot, but after trying the master degree in physics education, to become an highschool teacher, I came back,because I was passionate! And I don't regret it at all! If you are in 3rd year, maybe you don't have enough experience in lab research! Even if it can be very frustrating, it's also very interesting and very rewarding to see what you want to do works! But if you are looking for recognition from other people, or money, or celebrity... IT IS NOT FOR YOU! 
I can recognize myself in a lot of your thoughts. At the end of my bachelor in physics I was overworked and it made me doubt if I was doing the best thing for me. After a break and time to think I rediscovered why I like physics and why I want to do it. A break could help you too, even if you decide to leave physics.

Have you looked into one year master's programs? If you still want to do something related to science, but with more social interaction programs like science and business, science and education, or science and communication might suit you. A lot of jobs that physics majors get into like consultancy, IT or project management are still options with a master's in such an area. I have seen classmates take these paths in the Netherlands, it's true that it's rare for students to get a job directly after their bachelor's here.

Good luck! 
I did a physics degree because I found the subject interesting, I never had any plans to work in the field afterwards. The good thing with physics is that the problem solving skills you learn are transferable to a lot of jobs. I now work as a software engineer myself.
I don't know hoe other businesses handle hiring, but we treat a BS in physics the same as a BS in engineering. There are lots of entry level opportunities for young engineers. Some of the engineering jobs are a dull paperwork grind, but some people want that. Development engineering is very interesting. It is not pure science, true, but you might find that figuring out how to do something is just as rewarding as making scientific discoveries.
I'm in the same boat as you. At the moment a I'm in the middle of my second term and working on my teacher's laser spectroscopy lab. This has been giving me a lot of understanding on what I might work later on.

Sadly, I don't think I will like it. I've always enjoyed physics and maths, and I'm also enjoying all my subjects, but the career path doesn't seem interest me. I've been contemplating a change in course, to mechanical engineering, because from the talks that I had with my teachers, it appears be the major that best suits my interests. But I have roughly 1 year to decide, because of the lab work. Hopefully you will choose what's best for you and things will work out fine.
Hey OP I just got my Bachelors in Physics and Math in May and I was in a similar boat with you towards the end of my undergrad studies. 

I had always planned on doing the Ph.D. Track, but had decided before my last semester that going to grad school wasn't something I wanted to do, certainly not now and probably not ever. 

But then the night before my last final exam (electrodynamics) came around and I popped some adderall and stayed up all night studying (I hadn't payed attention in the class all semester and basically had to teach it all to myself that night). Around 4 AM, with the ability to focus well on the work, I had this huge epiphany that I was really enjoying solving practice problems and understanding them. After at least 2 or 3 semesters of feeling very burnt out, I started to feel very sad that I wouldn't be sitting in class and learning and accomplishing these things any more. At that moment, I decided I wanted to pursue physics further.

But I'm not doing it right now. I'm taking at least a year off to go teach English in Asia and then planning on coming back to do grad school.

Maybe your jadedness is more intense than mine was, but perhaps take some time to really think about why you did physics in the first place. Maybe some of that passion is still there. Maybe take some time off and see what you really want to do. But I'd definitely say don't go to grad school if you aren't sure you want to, and it isn't a big deal if you don't. 
95% of the time, #7 can be remedied by doing the reading before class.
I understand your concern, but I truly hope you do not believe that your time has been wasted. Having graduated with a BS in physics, I can attest to a lot of the concerns/displeasures you have had. Personally, I wasn't sure pursuing graduate study in physics was right for me afterwards. My concern was that so much time and effort in physics are dedicated simply to verifying existing models, to justify the use of various mathematical frameworks. Whereas, I sought to apply a lot of the fundamental knowledge gleaned from physics study more to the creating of deliverables. I went into nuclear engineering phd study, and the combination of physics and engineering approaches to my research seems to be  appreciated. 

The fact that cannot be understated enough, is that the skills you've undoubtedly acquired during you BS are universally applicable. The work ethic taken from hours spent approaching the same simple problem 100 different ways, the humility required when you realize our knowledge of the world around us is often based on models that consistently require updating, and the creativity needed when your study is based so heavily in abstraction.

Despite companies and places of work stating that they may more often be looking for people with pieces of paper that don't say physics on them, many don't realize the skillset that a BS in physics comes with. It may be hard to forge a path outside of the usual grind from BS right to grad school, but don't regret your choice, because I am certain that your degree has, at the bare minimum, instilled in you a phenomenal framework for being a lifelong learner in any field, or any career path
It's so funny, because if you list those same things, but with a positive tone instead of negative, it's exactly why I do physics.

Except maybe the 1st one, I hate talking about work. It makes other people feel dumb, and makes them think I'm smarter than I am. 
Hey man, I did a B.S. in Physics, then switched to Mechanical Engineering for grad school. 

All of the things you said, I felt those at some point (except for #1). 

What you have to remember is that studying physics changes the way your brain functions. It creates a specific kind of problem-solving mind, which studying other subjects does not. If you don't like labwork, stay out of gradschool. The social aspect only gets worse, the equipment gets louder, and the rooms get less sunny haha. 

But cheer up! You can get a job doing anything you're good at, and studying physics makes you good at a lot of things. Most smart people I know (e.g. my wife, best friends) did not study science in college. I was an outlier, like you. Almost every single one of them (6 people) have expressed to me some kind of regret for not pursuing computer science/chemistry/etc. The value of a hard-science education is something that appreciates over time. Lots of other degree programs (business admin, international studies, english, etc.) leave bright graduates with doubts, too. 


Everybody likes a physics major with enthusiasm. Just fake it til you make it, bro. 
You get to tell folks silly tales about the names of the derivatives of motion. Velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc...
If you where initially attracted to physics because of science fiction level physics or the excitement of new discovery (as I was) I recommend you either look into chemistry or engineering. Chemistry for one, is a science where you can actually see the effects in a macroscopic scale as apposed to physics where you are mostly limited to a computer spitting out numbers that don't make sense until you analyze them for months. Engineering (my current major) is more like applied physics. You take the knowledge obtained through physics and discover ways to implement it in new technology. It is hard to figure out what you want to do, but the most important first step is finding out what you *don't* want to do, so congratulations you're already halfway there! Good luck, and don't be afraid to explore a whole bunch of different things. 
I had regrets half way through junior year. I ended up going into CS with a physics degree 
As someone empathetic to some of the things you mention, I think it could help to take some time to remember why you decided to embark on this journey in the first place.  

I think if you're reason was that you'll have a bunch of friends and a great time socially then your disappointment is justified. 

If your interest was instead simply Science, namely physics then it might be good to remind yourself of that. Its about physics, its not about university. University degrees are just a semi convenient and formally necessary way to go about leaning physics. 


Do you perhaps study at TU/e? If so, I can totally agree with you on some points. Especially 3, 5, 6 and 7. Next to that, at the end of my first year BSc (now in my third) I realized that this wasn't the thing I wanted to do after all. Luckily I could change my electives drastically in order to prepare for a Master's in a different field of study, instead of starting a new BSc. Again, if you study at TU/e, from my experience the amount and variety of electives is very big, so maybe you can try some?
Honestly, it sounds like the problem is your university, not physics in general. My experience studying physics is almost completely opposite to yours.
**Context:** I'm Australian and I've heard the culture in Universities here is significantly more laid back and casual (and thus social?). I don't know anyone in my University that calls anyone by Dr. Name or Prof. Name. Everyone is on a first name basis, so take my perspective with that in mind. My sole point is that this isn't a problem with physics itself, it's one particular subset of physics culture somewhere in the world.


1) Depends who you hang out with, I guess.

2) You don't *have* to do lab work, but even most lab work is very team based. Most of my physics work is collaboration with other people.

3) Again, this clashes with my experience but maybe it's just the particular field/experiments you were doing. I'm always bouncing ideas off my coworkers and socializing with them while working.

4) Typically you would be working on a project that you can be pretty confident is going to work. It's all about standing on the shoulders of giants, right? So usually you're using established methods with established equipment to do some tiny thing that isn't established yet. The fact that the equipment and methods are established usually means your project has a high chance of success. If you're constantly involved with projects that have no positive results then whoever is calling the shots on what the projects should be really needs to up their game. 

If you're in undergrad or doing some other minor project then that may just be the way the cookie crumbles for that project.

5) Again, really just depends on where you end up and who you end up socializing with. My office space is 3/13 = ~ 23% female. They all are super interesting people with great hobbies and different opinions on stuff. My hobbies are gaming, writing, art, philosophy, politics, learning Japanese, scientific visual design. Maybe all these things count as boring to you, but I'm probably the least interesting of my cohort.

6) This is entirely an issue of how you get taught and how you learn. Both of these things can be improved, but it's not the fault of physics.

7) Your professors just sound like they're not very good at the teaching/nurturing side of things. This seems to be a common point in most of your complaints. It just so happens that the place and people you find yourself with are putting a downer on your physics life. This is not the fault of physics.

8) If you're interested in money it is true that living the life of a physicist will not make you much money. You should be a physicist because you love physics. That being said, having a degree in physics is great for applying to economic/accounting oriented jobs which WILL get you a lot of money. Lots of physicists go into high frequency trading and make too much money to know what to do with.


Having finished reading and responding to your whole post I see that you're in undergrad. Learning physics is completely different to doing physics. But if you're feeling down and out by undergrad then I can't really recommend physics to you. That being said, it might just be because your learning environment is horrid. All I can say is if you do decide to go into post-grad then you should make sure you go somewhere where you like the people and professors.
> 1) Nobody ever understands or is interested in what I am saying if I bring up physics in conversations with others....

As a PhD student who loves doing outreach events to the public about the subject, its difficult to get people talking about physics. Many people struggle at school doing it, and don't see it as something fun and cool. The trick is to find something that's amazing and find a neat way of explaining it, or bringing up a topic about something thats happened recently in the news.

You've got to remember that people might not have a background or know anything about it. Imagine trying to talk to someone about football that knows nothing about it - just more people know football than they do physics. 

> 2) Laboratory work sucks. You often sit in a dark room without sunshine and often with a lot of noisy equipment...

While this is certainly true (in some research fields), it's sometimes not a bad thing, just make sure that if, for instance people are having coffee or going to lunch, you try and join them. The long stretches in the lab where you're just with the equipment making stuff work can be quite therapeutic. 

> 3) Social interaction overall is just very low...

Not something I've ever experienced in grad school, quite the opposite actually compared to undergrad.

> 4) Accomplishments don't feel rewarding and aren't interesting on their own...

This is just a matter of perspective. For instance, I can't measure high frequency motion with the thing I'm working on because a fan is rattling a 1 tonne optical bench and causing a laser beam to move about by hundredths of a nanometer... That genuinely is amazing!

>5) Uninteresting people to study/work with. Most people seem to have very little hobbies/student life besides physics. 

Again, not something I've ever found in Grad school. Talk to people,  they're more interesting than you first think. 

> 6) Studying and finishing assignments is overall just a very frustrating experience. You often get stuck with no idea what to do to get to the solution.

This is what research is about, your doing it, because no one else has done it before. You get around this by trying different stuff, and writing it down to rule out factors. Writing up is annoying, but at least you get a paper or two out of the whole thing. 

> 7) Professors/Teachers seem uninterested and are really bad in explaining stuff. I keep hearing stuff like 'oh that's trivial, that's trivial, that's trivial, trivial trivial trivial, i'll skip that'..

Go to them, and explain that its not trivial to you. I've had lecturers that say its trivial, find someone else who will know. You'll find that you'll never utter the words 'it's trivial' or 'it's easy' to anyone.

> 8) At the end of the day you don't even seem to get paid that much for going through all of this. Afterall that's what a job is for. 

If you're doing grad school / research in an institution for the money, you've got the wrong idea. You do it because you find it fun, to explore more about the world in a way that no one else has done before. 

With depression, people get it. I had depression doing my masters project, it wasn't a fun time, but it will get better, no matter how bleak it sounds now, either on your own, or getting help help. You're certainly not alone in getting depressed / having imposter syndrome at all. By doing a degree, especially in a degree like physics, your doing something few people do (see point 1), certainly don't take anything away from what your doing, or think that the whole thing should be trivial. Its not.


I think it just depends on your personality type. Most of the things you list I love and have entirely different experiences with. Think of what made you first love physics and science and try to imagine why you started your BS in physics. 
Maybe you can transition into a data science career.
I just graduated in May with my bachelors in Physics, and while I agree with much of what you said, I also agree with other people who've commented in that it seems like a **bit of an attitude problem**. 

I am lucky enough to have spent enough time on an astronomy research project that forced me to become good at articulating physics to "lay-people". This also stems from the fact that I truly find physics and (as /u/mk_gecko said) metaphysics absolutely fascinating.  

All things considered, I am more on the introverted side of the spectrum (pretty average for a physicist) so I feel your pain on the social side. I struggled with depression through all 4 years of my undergrad (US), but finding a good friend group of varying disciplines really opened my mind and helped me cope with life and the intense difficulty of studying physics. Don't let the cynicism consume you, there are people out there who really do care about physics, many of them who don't study any of it. I am lucky enough to have friends who love metaphysics and physics almost as much as I do, and they love to hear about physical concepts applied to their everyday lives. It makes me feel like all that I've studied is so worth it.

Chin up, pal. Having the problem solving skills like many of us do really does open doors to some completely unrelated fields. Test the waters, find your passions, and pursue them. That degree puts you meters ahead of other.

Also, would not suggest grad school (yet) if this is your current demeanor about physics.
I personally haven't had many of the same experiences while studying physics, but I can try to offer some advice anyway.

If you are no longer enjoying your physics studies, you most likely don't want to make a career out of it. You probably don't even want to go to graduate school in it (even if that is the norm in your country). It's okay to leave the field. You might consider several options, such as going directly into industry or pursuing a Master's degree in a related field, such as engineering, data science, finance, or computer science. Physicists are often able to transition into these and other areas. If you can, I might try taking some classes and building skills in these areas before you graduate. You also might seek out alumni of your university or others in your broader social network who have made similar decisions after getting their bachelor's.

However, I think you should also be concerned with the root cause of the feelings you describe. It seems like you're suffering some social isolation, struggles with motivation, overall negativity, and possibly depression. (Disclaimer: I'm a physicist, not a psychologist, and I'm basing this on one reddit post.) One of the main symptoms of depression is a loss of interest in activities that you previously enjoyed. Furthermore, there isn't always a clear-cut reason that a person develops depression at any given point in their life. What I'm getting at is that your physics studies may be the reason you're feeling depressed, but it could also be that underlying depression (with or without an apparent cause) is the reason you no longer enjoy physics. If you have underlying depression, that will follow you even if you change fields, and you probably won't be any happier.

I'd honestly recommend seeking help from a mental health professional. They should be able to help you work through some of these feelings, hopefully help you sort out what's really at the bottom of them, and guide you towards a better future for yourself.
First, given your strong background in physics, I'd consider engineering. In a nutshell, physicists study things, engineers design and build things (including equipment used by physicists and other scientists). Ultimately, engineering is applied science and a lot of engineering relies heavily on physics, so you're ahead of the game. Both fields are critically important -- engineers can't do their jobs without science, and scientists generally can't do their jobs without engineering -- but the creative aspects of engineering make it more appealing to many people.

Second, like you, I loved and was good at science, and started out in Chemical Engineering because I thought chemistry was fascinating. I had an awesome advanced chemistry prof my first year, but I realized I was crap in labwork, and one day I got a look at all the pasty upperclass physics students interred in the bowels of the chem building and decided it wasn't for me. I jumped to Computer Engineering, which electrical engineering with more of a digital / software focus.

Professionally, I ended up working as an embedded software engineer. These days, pretty much everything powered by electricity that is more complex than a light bulb has got a little computer in it running software written by someone like me. That includes not only consumer gadgets and everything in the transportation and communication sectors, but medical and scientific instruments of all sizes; big science projects like the Large Hadron Collider and fusion reactors contain thousands of embedded devices. As careers go, it's interesting, creative, fun, and profitable.

Third, the absolute worst classes I took were my three semesters of engineering physics, taught in the physics dept. Shamefully bad. The open secret was that the physicists looked down on engineers and gave us the oldest, couldn't give a shit, going through the motions, one foot out the door prof. And this was at one of the best public institutions in the US. I'm sorry to hear your experience wasn't much better as a physics major.

With respect to the social aspects, engineering is generally fairly team-oriented, sometimes intensely so. Most people still won't know what you are talking about -- that's true with any specialty profession -- but you'll have more people to talk about it with. And it's getting better -- especially in fields like software engineering -- but it's still too much of a sausage fest.
Hey don't be discouraged. I'm a physics major too with a concentration in astronomy. Even if you feel like you're making no progress, just realize that at least you're taking steps. You have to build a house one brick at a time. And even If you just add a few bricks it's still contributing to something super cool. You could find a new fundamental particle or figure out if humans can live on other planets based on their atmosphere and distance from their sun. Science is about answering questions and ending up with more questions. But you can leave a legacy and find out something huge. Don't give up! Physics majors are awesome. And I'm a girl so one day I'll help out with the demographic. lol. But not grad school maybe. Just see your options and find an alternative. I'm just a sophomore in college so I can't give much advice. But I think that it would be cool so stick with it.
If you're approaching the end it might be worth finishing it. I know it sucks but if you think you can graduate with a decent gpa for grad school then stick it out and go for a more hands on major for grad school. for instance, my enviro engineering professor was a physics student until his doctorate when he studied flow patterns of pollutants in bays and estuaries. i've heard similar cases for other physical science doctorates. you've made it this far, might as well finish up and maybe try doing an internship with another dicipline. a friend from college was a math major but we met in atmospheric science because he was helping an atmosci professor with his atmospheric model perameters and obviously needed to take some classes to know a little something about what he was modeling. with the physics degree you'll be the pick of the liter for a gradaute program for math/formula heavy majors like atmospheric science or aerospace engeineering or shit... anything really. my calc professor at community college got a doctorate in something random like business just to get the bump in pay and he said it was super easy because a lot of projects were group projects so the rest of the group did all the work and gave him all the math to do which he said was super simple stuff.

until then, find a hobby/release. like archery, or shooting which will allow you to apply physics principles in a fun manner. or maybe something more physically rigorous. brazilian jiujitsu seems to apeal to more cerebral types. something that gets you out of your place, in a different environment, physically demanding but also teaches you to relax too. maybe even just yoga or weight lifting or jogging or cycling or swimming. these are activities where you can have time to think by yourself but give you the oppertunity to interact with people that aren't physicists and maybe even more ladies. plus, there's a lot of research supporting that physical activity improves people's outlook and helps with depression. a lot of ladies do yoga too and it's becoming more common for men, especially athletes.
(7) pretty accurately captures my experience. The physics teaching staff at my university were without exception incredibly arrogant people with massive chips on their shoulders. Every word out of their mouths was an attempt to prove how smart they were rather than help or explanation. I was glad to have engineering double as an alternative option.
I really feel your pain. I have only just started a major in physics in my undergraduate degree. I'm 22 and have also tried studying chemistry and biochem and I have to say the labs in physics have been the least exciting compared to labs in other sciences. But I have found physics to be more social than my other science classes because we all bond over how fucking frustrated we are that everything is so hard to understand. Also some of the teachers are condescending because they have been doing this shit for years and don't seem to be able to relate to us when we don't understand something that is so simple to them so they get annoyed having to explain it to everyone a million times. Just try and remember why it was you chose to study physics in the first place. Life is so fucking amazing and if we are even able graze the surface of understanding some of life's most complex problems then that is enough for me. I just can't imagine being able to discover something that hasn't been thought of yet because I will first have to learn everything that has already been figured out. I am shattered though because now that I am almost a year into this major I have just come to the realization that the entire course they are teaching us is catered to the research my university is doing, which includes zero astrophysics or astronomy, which are the only types of physics I wanted to learn :( 
   As a man with a PhD in physics and currently working in research I would advise you to finish your studies. With the skill set that you will obtain in the studies you can do a lot of interesting stuff outside science and this is the main reason why finishing is a good idea. And you can also stay in science if you feel like it later.
   You are depressed because you do not understand stuff. It is normal NOT to understand stuff because physics is hard. When we are at this life is hard as well. These are just facts. What you need to do is not to take failing to understand personally and accept is just as a part of the game. This in no way reflects upon you as being stupid or something like this. Such thoughts are only destructive. We are all different and we all need a different ``click" to truly understand some things. I once read a certain passage from a book 15times over before I understood what is going on in my own way. Needles to say that you have people pretending to be very smart - some people are truly smart but not nearly as much as you would think. Most are just faking it.  
   So people tell you it gets better later. Sorry to break this to you but this is pretty much how science is. Studying is a great time of life because of the freedom from life-stuff but it can not possibly get better when you have a wife, kids and need to bullshit about what you are going to do and how it is the best thing ever, only to get funding. 

   Your thoughts are perfectly normal and you have nothing to be depressed about, being stupid etc... because this is not true. It might make sense even to finish PhD and decide then what to do. I know a lot of people who did a PhD in physics. Some of them stayed in science as I did but some went on to industry and let me tell you that physicists can work a lot of different jobs because of the problem solving skills: in banks, in programming, in engineering, etc..
> 1) Nobody ever understands or is interested in what I am saying if I bring up physics in conversations with others. People who studied geology, medicine, business etc. always do seem to have interesting subjects to bring up.

Not something I've noticed, don't want to rule it out.

> 2) Laboratory work sucks. You often sit in a dark room without sunshine and often with a lot of noisy equipment. It's almost never a team-effort as you don't interact with other people, but just your lab equipment.

Depends on the university, for my degree we were only in a dark room when it was absolutely necessary and first year was in pairs, second year one semester in pairs and one semester was an electronics experiment in a group of four. Third year was a dissertation which was obviously alone but, as mine was coding, was more time in the library/meeting your supervisor as per any other course.

> 3) Social interaction overall is just very low. Preparing an experiment, writing a report, studying new phenomena, analysing data, creating a model. Most of the time it's just you doing your own thing.

Mainly covered this above, depends on the uni.

> 4) Accomplishments don't feel rewarding and aren't interesting on their own. At the end of a whole experiment, the conclusion could be: 'I cannot measure this or that phenomena accurate enough with this equipment'. Well... awesome I quess..yay..

This is what labs in first year was like, it got much better in 2nd year and the dissertation was extremely rewarding.

> 5) Uninteresting people to study/work with. Most people seem to have very little hobbies/student life besides physics. Physics also seems to take a huge chunk of your time, more than other studies do. Not to mention it's a sausagefest with in my year 96% of the people being male...

It does take up a massive chunk of your time, and there are some people who will have no interests other than Physics, but there will also be a lot of people who do. It may take a week or two to work out who's who in that sense but afterwards it's sound. As for the amount of blokes, that's unfortunately something that you'll find throughout science unfortunately (my uni was also 70%/30%ish) engineering and CS are even worse and Maths is similar.

> 6) Studying and finishing assignments is overall just a very frustrating experience. You often get stuck with no idea what to do to get to the solution. You often don't understand something at all and if you're not constantly 100% concentrated you get lost and behind really quickly.

Agree with this, it takes a while for it to just click.

> 7) Professors/Teachers seem uninterested and are really bad in explaining stuff. I keep hearing stuff like 'oh that's trivial, that's trivial, that's trivial, trivial trivial trivial, i'll skip that'. Everything is 'trivial and easy' to them and they do not seem to understand that it's definately not to their students... Seriously it is not uncommon to have a 2-hour class and 80% of the students, including me walking out: 'Oke I had no idea what he was talking about the last 90 minutes, quess I'll have to study it all by myself at home and hope I understand'. Literally every damn time. And asking the teacher to explain it better never helps as their explanations are often just..bad. They just make you feel dumb and it's frustrating to be honest.

Just like any course, this depends on the uni, I had some bad lecturers, some really good lecturers, pretty much the same everybody on any other course I talked to.

> 8) At the end of the day you don't even seem to get paid that much for going through all of this. Afterall that's what a job is for. And more often than not, even if you love physics, if you are going to do it 40 hours a week you will get bored of it and you are going to start hating your job. Some extra money to have a less stresfull life is always welcome then.

Yeah it's definitely far from the best degree to study in terms of money.

Basically what I'm getting at is that while these factors could be a cause of the degree it could (in my opinion more likely) be a cause of where you are studying. I'm not trying to convince you to stay studying Physics, do what you thinks best, but keep an open mind. Masters are much more specific to the parts you want to do, and often easier because of it, the lab work especially - prefer theoretical/coding, choose a project that focuses on that and pick one with a good supervisor and all of a sudden it's much more enjoyable.
To all your concerns: no kidding, have you ever met a physicist?? Ha haa haaaaa
a little tip, never feel to dumb to ask something, when you dont understand something in the courses.

it is a good decision a physicist is the general tool for science. :)
This is why I chose to become a Medical Physicist in Oncology (External Radio Therapy).

1)  Nobody will be interested in hearing what you do, except people working in oncology or radiology. But I always say I work with cancer treatments and stop there. :D

2) The work is very practical/clinical. There is almost no laboratory work. Some measurements and calibrations on the treatment machines. But that’s just welcomed variation in the clinical workflow.

3) Social interactions is very important. We work as a multidisciplinary team with physicists, nuses, doctors , engineers , IT-department and management. And every so often we participate in treatment and meet  the patients.

4) The accomplishment is to help the patients fight the cancer or to relieve the pain.

5) I found having a goal for my study (to be a Madical Physicist) helped me motivate thru really difficult courses. The end courses are more specific for medical physics and fun/practical. The gender distribution in medical physics is almost equal men and women. Especially for the last 15 years, which is nice. And it’s often quite a social bunch; I guess it’s the clinical part that brings these kind of people.

6) The study is difficult. But try to work with your classmates and do there together. You have to learn it for yourself, but it helps when you get stuck.

7) Some uninterested teachers you just have to bear with. Fuck those old farts! Set your goal and do what you have to do to get there by yourself then. 
8) Medical Physicists are quite well paid and jobs are quite easy to get depending on where you live.

9) Nice to hear your thoughts. Best of luck whatever you chose do go.

Don't memorize, understand.
Physics involves a lot of mathematics, so reading your textbook and going over your notes is not (and will never be) enough. It's not a field like biology where memorizing things will get you through it, you need to fundamentally understand the concepts, and continually apply them in problem sets and exercises. 

Just like Math, practice is key. Practice a lot. Identify where you're struggling the most and ask for explanations on that topic from your teacher (for this I'd recommend checking out the [Feynman Technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/50f9mr/how_should_i_study_physics/d73z5g0)).
We're gonna need more information. I'm in a similar position (I'm in high school studying physics) and the best way I learn is by just doing heaps of questions, if I get one wrong I would try and look into why I got it wrong instead of just leaving it as marked wrong. What do you have the most trouble with? Explaining concepts or applying concepts? Physics is one of the few subjects that requires sound explanation and mathematical skills. 
The best method that has always worked for me if there's something I really don't understand conceptually is to writer my own lecture notes on the topic.  I write out basically how I would teach the topic to someone else, in my own words, with full derivations.  I have a PhD in physics and am a professional researcher and I still do it.

That is for if I'm really having conceptual trouble with something.  If the issue is that the concepts are fine but you can't equate that to success on tests and such the only option is practice, practice, PRACTICE.  Do every single problem in the back of the textbook chapter, then do them again.  There is absolutely no other way to improve.

If you look over the material and say "yep, I get that" and that's all you do, you WILL NOT remember any of it come test time or be able to solve problems using. You just won't. Practice, practice, practice.
Doing a lot of problems helps. You must also lay out these problems clearly, what do you know and what are you trying to find? From there draw diagrams, underline the question, predict the answer etc. Now that's for problems, for other more general questions try breaking down the question to make it as simple as possible, and when you study pretend you are teaching a class, and even better, pretend that one student does not 'get' it, make it as simple as possible.
I always found that if I learned something that I previously found difficult, or didn't understand before was to try and explain it to someone else. Some areas of physics I couldn't learn by reading, I had to do them, play with the equations and see what happened when I took something to limits. Though it really depends on which bit you're finding difficult to understand, is it the maths aspect, or is it more of a case of, I have this system, I don't know what it should do type of thing?

This week is high speed video week! Planning to go from 50,000 fps up to 500,000 (or more if we have enough light). 
Physics wise, I am reviewing some QM/QFT and GR. I might end up reading some of Jim Gates text on SUSY soon, too. I am meeting with a senior physicist in UMD's department to discuss stuff like taking graduate QFT, GR, and ST here at some point and/or doing an independent study. I think the scheduling for that will come this week and the meeting next. 

I'm also doing a ton of math. (https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/51a2z8/what_are_you_working_on/d7aho8h)
Fine tuning my addback routine to effectively improve my gamma ray efficiency.
Just started my PhD in the theory of open quantum systems with light-matter interactions yesterday. Enjoying short limbo period before full workload kicks in! In terms of physics I'm getting diggy with the Dicke model. 
With my pretty amateur opinion, I would assume that the ways would not propagate like water waves, but there would still be some motion. Physically, those ballpit balls are compressible and relatively light, so they won't be able to act like water with is approximated (to a pretty good degree) to be incompressible. 
~~I imagine it would look something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inA-36YRV0Y~~

~~The water waves should propagate (or else where else would the energy go?), and will be a combination of transverse and longitudinal waves. The objects floating on top, on the other hand, will just be transverse waves because their longitudinal motion is constrained.~~

Edit: misinterpreted the question
Try bookzz.org for a PDF. Or try your school's library.

I had a copy but I sold it.
You could use a thermoelectric device, but it would be very bad at removing the heat from the PC, resulting in the CPU overheating.
There are a few ways to convert heat into electricity, but i think you're looking for a peltier-type device / chip. It's not going to be efficient by any means, and it's not going to convert a whole lot of heat into electricity. Also, it works on temperature difference, so you would have to find a way to efficiently cool down the cold side of the device.

all in all: not really. 

Best you can really hope for is maybe having a little toy sterling engine spin around and entertain you.

edit: if you want to run a liquid line to a row of peltier chips you might be able to get something, but the pumps to move the liquid would use more electricity than you would get.
Thermoelectric energy harvesting is an option but it's not really worth it.  You'd get something like microWatts.  Even at Carnot efficiency, the highest efficiency of any heat engine allowed by the laws of thermodynamics you could only get a:

(T_hot - T_cold)/T_hot ~ 40 Kelvin/ 333 Kelvin = 12% power conversion efficiency in such a scenario.

There's serious research into using thermoelectrics in reverse, as cooling devices for chips that can be grown right into the integrated circuit, but it's a waste for energy harvesting.

EDIT: Playing with this a little bit more, I believe the figure of merit (the one "number" that quantifies the efficiency of a given thermoelectric material) of the best commercial TEs are about 1 (The best lab ones are 2-2.5).  That corresponds to (sqrt(1+1) -1 )/ (sqrt(1+1)  + 293/333)*Carnot efficiency = 2% efficiency.  So the best store bought thermoelectric would have a 2% conversion efficiency in that scenario.  It just ain't worth it. 
I've never given any serious consideration to doing anything else.

> They say they feel like freaking idiots, even though they're applying for graduate school!

Everyone feels that way and it's sort of true. To be brutally honest, coming straight out of undergrad, you don't really know anything yet. You have lots of skills (hopefully) that you can build on in a variety of different career paths, but you're far from an expert in any particular thing.

>Graduate school does seem an interesting investment, even if it is for just a masters.

Grad school in physics/chemistry isn't really an "investment", at least not in a monetary sense. Tuition is typically free, and you get paid enough to live off of. So the only thing you're spending is your time, not money.
To answer your original question: I just knew I loved taking physics classes. I took almost every single theory class offered by my undergrad (freshman sequence, thermo, math methods, e&m, quantum, stat mech, classical mechanics, condensed matter, atomic, particle, GR), so by the time I finished undergrad, I knew that I loved studying physics from a book, but I was worried that I might not actually enjoy working in the field. I did research as an undergrad, but I wasn't super pumped about it. Grad school is paid for in physics, so I just figured if I hated research I'd leave grad school and find a job. Fortunately, I really enjoy my research.

>How does that even work? Does he really just have to love virology and NMR that much? People are not at all who I pictured them to be, undergraduate or graduate. Even some of the professors (and yes, I am convinced that most are not socially inept PIs who put a drain on the team, they seem to be an outlier).

I'll answer this in two parts. 
1) I do believe you have to be passionate about your research to make it through grad school. You're spending 5-6 years or more at a pretty low pay compared to what you could get in industry working on one specific project. Additionally, you have deadlines to meet. You need to have results to keep your funding. You may have collaborators that need you to finish something by a certain date. You have conferences that you'll write the abstract to months in advance, promising data, and then realize a month before the conference that there's no way you can get data by the time you give your talk. There's just a lot of things that make grad school pretty stressful, and if you don't love what you do, then I personally wouldn't think it's worth it.

2) Be aware of the shitty professor. You're right that most professors aren't shitty, but it's good that you've noticed they exist. I would very strongly stress that if you decide to pursue physics grad school, before you decide to work for a professor you should talk to as many of their students as you can, and ask other students at the school about said professor. As a grad student, I don't want new people coming in and working for shitty professors. I love what I do, I want you to love what you do. I'll be very blunt and tell you if a professor is a dick, and many of my peers are the same. So don't worry too much about that, it's a real problem, but it can be avoided (unless you fall in love with something super specific only done by one or two people...sometimes life just sucks).

tl;dr I knew I loved physics classes pretty early on in undergrad, I wasn't convinced I loved working in physics until grad school. You can avoid working for shitty professors if you talk to students in the department that professors works in, usually if a professor is shitty, grad students will tell you (we don't want you to be miserable).
Probably after watching a few PBS Spacetime videos I was like "holy fucking shit, no way...  Really that's the way things are?" 
You just kind of know. I was kind of like you - apathetic and bored as shit about everything. Physics was really the only thing I cared about, and well, I liked math because I was pretty good at it, but I never really had any role models (not until college and my physics role models are few and far between) and never really did home experiments.

Anyways, the first tell-tale sign (even if I didn't know it yet) was in elementary school and it's the only schoolwork related thing that still makes a clear picture in my mind. It was an experiment on heat transfer (even though 8 year old me had no clue what that was) where we put butter and a paper clip and stuck each end in a hot and cold water cup. I thought that was the coolest thing ever. Anyways, fast forward and I realized I fell in love with the beauty of applied math, the natural world and the way it works, and how content I am knowing the world turns the way it does.

I guess what i'm saying is you know when you'll know. I feel like, in any field, the more you learn, the more you should know that you don't know much - the universe is vast and there is still so much to explore and figure out. Also, students and professors are people too. People are weird and different and quirky and that's okay (I think normal is too predicable and boring). And yes, some people do love virology and NMR (or the underlying science behind it) that much when they dedicate the majority of their lives to it.

They have different cross-sections because they're different things. There's no reason for the cross-section to be the same between different isotopes or different elements.

As for the governing factors, it's complicated. First of all, cross-sections are a function of energy. The probability of neutron capture can vary very strongly with the energy of the incident neutron.

But for a given energy, the capture cross-section will depend on the structure of the nucleus. Is there a resonant state at the right energy? If so the cross-section will be higher.
Cross sections are driven by the physics of the nucleus (which will change based on the number of neutrons in there...for different isotopes) rather than the chemistry, which is how the electrons interact with their environment. Different isotopes of a given element will have the same chemistry (mostly) because they'll usually have the same electronic orbital structure...but just when you look at nuclear physics and cross sections can you see their differences. 
Nuclear structure arguments. Boron 10 has an unpaired neutron. It captures an incident neutron, becoming Boron 11 and closing the 1p shell, and doesn't "want " to capture anymore neutrons.

lol.

I can't even.
one is a fermion and one a boson, that could have serious changes, especially for collision experiments
Hawking Radiation, if I remember correctly, can be proven through black body radiation and those related equations since a black hole is a perfect black body. I wrote a very brief undergrad-level paper covering this as a final project for my thermal class. It all started with the second law of thermodynamics. 
> This is a serious problem for modern science, given that many technologies depend on an accurate measurement of the kilogram

can someone please give an example of a technology that requires this high sensitivity.
> The researchers placed a **known mass** on one end of the scale and then counterbalanced it by sending an electric current through a movable coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field. They then used that electromagnetic force to measure Planck's constant down to an accuracy of 34 parts per billion.

How do they know the mass of the known mass? Wouldn't it also have to be known to an accuracy of 34 parts per billion?

(I assume not, but don't know enough to know why)
Due to confinement in QCD, quarks and gluons that are produced in high energy collisions cannot exist freely, and instead form collimated 'jets' of hadrons.

These jets contain useful information about the behaviour of QCD, but matching properties of experimentally observed jets to perturbative QCD calculations is difficult. The definition of a jet depends strongly on the detector and algorithms used to reconstruct it, and the subsequent hadronisation within the jet are governed by the non-perturbative QCD regime where calculations are even harder to make. Aggregate properties of events with jets, of which the thrust is one, are fairly robust towards these things, so can be used to compare theoretical predictions with experimental observations and measure parameters of QCD, such as the running coupling constant.

Nowadays, as far as I know (I am not an expert in jet physics), the use of more robust jet reconstruction algorithms and improvements in QCD calculations and event generators mean that event shape variables like thrust are less important than they once were if you want to do things with jets. That said, that event shapes are well predicted now by perturbative QCD calculations means that the QCD jet background to other interesting physics processes (such as top quark and tau lepton decays) can be discriminated against much more easily experimentally, as the distributions in these variables will be quite different.
Also see the answer to a very similar question [here](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/278256/what-does-thrust-and-thrust-axis-mean-in-particle-physics).
This is really cool!

Jokes aside, this is an awesome experiment, looking forward to seeing what results come from it.
I don't understand: if this neutrinoless double beta decay only happens once every trillion trillion years... how long are they planning on running this experiment?  If they ran it a 100 billion times longer than the current age of the universe, there's a 50% chance of it occuring?!

(Boy, Italian refrigerators must be super-reliable!)
I worked on it during the summer from my junior to senior year. We were doing a test tower while the main experiment was being built. I couldn't complain though because I got to live overlooking the Italian countryside for the summer 
Could someone elaborate on the lead? Why does it have to be of Roman epoch?
"coldest cubic meter in the universe"

...in the *known* universe
Chilling how far we have come. And what other cool stuff awaits us ahead? 

How much energy does it take to actually run these kind of devices? Because it seems like that you suck out nearly all of the energy in this tiny space, but at the cost of expending many times more the amount that you took out. 
Can someone share how big these towers are?
Yeah but how does the fridge help detect this event ?
Asymptotic as usual :P
I could imagine a lot of quantum computing experiments I could do with a goddamn cubic meter of cold stage.
All that just to chill some beers?
Orbital mechanics. If you want the crash course on it look up the game kerbal space program
Second law of thermodynamics, the arrow of time and irreversibility.
Maybe a more experimental topic: Gravitation waves? The LHC?
Dimensional analysis could be good. At its core, it's basically just making sure formulas have consistent units, but you could show examples of how you can almost guess the right formula for a lot of things just by examining the units of the quantities involved. And it would be very practical too. Learning to be careful with units saves you a lot of mistakes in calculations.

Not to mention, you'd almost certainly be the only one doing it.
High school students writing about QM is risky, it's good that u chose to avoid it, cause usually people get it wrong. 

I'd suggest the star formation process and how they evolve and die depending on their mass. (black holes, neutron stars...). You can analyze the way they produce energy (fusion) and present a simple diagram about the elemnets and the radiation they emit after the fusion. 

The *standard model* is also an interesting topic and you do not need the QM to explain it at a high school level. You can talk about the forces of nature(how they work? -> virtual particles) and how the strong force keeps the nucleus together.
Black Hole physics is super cool! Specifically the Information Paradox and its attempted resolutions.
Just do simple harmonic motion, it's easy to talk about and has application in a bunch of different areas of physics. 
Magnets, electricity, optics, electronics/circuits, kinematics.
I would go for a topic in fluid mechanics. Maybe something like the no-slip condition or Taylor dispersion. If you choose Taylor dispersion read the paper by Taylor himself. Genius!
Personally I would do a talk on Time Dilation or the Doppler effect, both very interesting.
You could try to explain magnetism (it's not as simple as it seems) and talk about ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, diamagnetism, and perromagnetism. There are some pretty cool demonstrations for this and it's a cool way to talk about some of the basic concepts in E&M.

A lot of what I'm about to say below is going to involve quantum mechanics on a base level cause it's optics, but you don't have to go into depth with the quantum mechanics to explain it.

There's the photoelectric effect which explains solar cells. This was discovered by Einstein which he received the Nobel prize for (I assume most high school kids think he won it for special relativity, which he didn't). You can also expand this to also talk about the wave-particle duality.

Also, with the wave-particle duality you can use this to show how you can transmit sound using a laser and bring it on as part of a hands-on demonstration.

You can also talk about semiconductors, crystalline (p-n junctions) or amorphous solids (thin-film solar cells), and their electrical properties and how they come about with just some basic general chemistry and electromagnetism (no need to go fully in details, laymen terms make it just as cool).
I'd go for the ["helium-balloon-in-a-car"-phenomenon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8mzDvpKzfY) (don't use that name for it!), which is demonstrating some things about buoyancy and accelerated coordinate systems.

Something that isn't well understood by drivers today is kinetic friction and centripetal force. As V^2 /R get's closer to the kinetic friction coefficient, the car begins to slide. Why not make a subject that will pertain and interest the audience? How to drive a car, and not crash.
I studied biophysics and did a research project on the Physics of Hearing, specifically bats and echolocation.  Something like that could be interesting and possibly unique.  

You could also looking into imaging technology like CT/CAT Scans, electron microscopy, MRI, etc. and the physics behind those. 

Physics of flying and how it applies to birds is cool too
Dynamical systems and chaos is a really cool topic that would be appropriate for this. You could also talk a little about high dimensional systems and pattern formation. 
You could talk about Schrödinger's cat. You'd have to mention quantum superposition and briefly explain why it's relevant to the topic, but if you want to be unique that would be a pretty good bet, since I honestly doubt most high school students know what Schrödinger's cat is. Plus, it's a pretty practical - although paradoxical - concept.

You could also do it on the Uncertainty Principle, although some people might go for that as well.
Take an empty soda can, fill it with a tablespoon  of water or less and boil the water inside with a Bunsen  burner or backpacking stove until steam starts to come out (use tongs). Immediately immerse can into ice water upside down and as  the vapor condenses it leaves a vacuum; atmospheric pressure compresses the can. If you do it right it looks like magic.

To understand M-theory one must first have some knowledge of string theory. For hundreds of years, scientists have thought that the simplest objects in the universe are points, like dots. String theory says that this is wrong and that the simplest objects in the universe are shaped like pieces of string. These strings are so small that even when looked at very closely they look like points. Each basic particle is created by the strings vibrating in different patterns. The reason scientists had not thought of this idea for so long is that strings are much harder to work with than points. They seem to break such rules as causality and special relativity, which says that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light.

String theory has been developed because of a very important problem that has existed for almost 100 years. Albert Einstein's theory that describes the universe on very large scales (it is called general relativity), disagrees with two theories that describe things on very small scales (they are called quantum mechanics and the standard model). There are also problems with the Standard Model: it includes about 20 numbers that seem to have no explanation; it has too many basic particles - some scientists think it needs to have fewer; and it does not include gravity, which is needed to explain weight.

Many of these problems can be solved by thinking of basic particles as strings. Now there is only one number with no explanation, which gives the size of the strings. String theory includes particles that cause gravity, called gravitons; finding this out delighted the scientists who work on string theory. So, string theory successfully brings General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics together.

But there are some problems with string theory. Normally, we think of the universe as having 4 dimensions, or basic directions. 3 of these basic directions can be thought of as "up/down", "forward/backward" and "left/right". The other direction is time. String theory needs 10 basic directions.

These six other directions can be explained if they are "curled up", so they are much too small to see. For example, by following the path of a spiral, it is possible to go a great distance along it without moving very far. The 6 other directions can be thought of as tiny spirals - strings can move along them a great distance but not seem to move. This can be looked at as a mathematical trick—a trick that has little to do with the real world that can be seen and touched. Such tricks are allowed if they give a theory that can better tell us how things work.

Another problem with string theory is that there are 5 different versions of it. Each version allows different kinds of strings and says they work in different ways. String theory is supposed to be a theory of everything so there should be only one version, not 5. M-theory solves this problem.
M-theory

In 1995 Edward Witten started what has been called the Second Superstring Revolution by introducing M-theory to the world. This theory combines the 5 different string theories (along with a previously abandoned attempt to unify General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics called 11D-Supergravity) into one theory. What Witten actually did was to predict that the fact that all these different theories were connected was a result of there being some underlying theory of which they were all approximations. This theory is somewhat vague in nature and has not yet been pinned down.

Additionally, it was found that the equations that required string theory to exist in 10 dimensions were actually approximations as well. The proposed M-theory would need one extra dimension and instead be a theory that takes place in 11 dimensions. Witten has himself compared this idea in simple terms to a general who takes up a position on a hilltop, the extra space-coordinate, to get a better view of the battlefield's two other dimensions.

The combination is accomplished by knitting together a web of relationships between each of the string theories called dualities (specifically, S-duality, T-duality, and U-duality). Each of these dualities provides a way of converting one of the string theories into another. T-duality is probably the most easily explained of the dualities. It has to do with the size, written as R, of the curled up dimensions of the string theories. It was discovered that by taking a Type IIA string theory that has a size R and changing the radius to 1/R the result will end up being what is equivalent to a Type IIB theory of size R. This duality, along with the others, creates connections between all 5 (or 6, if supergravity is counted) theories. The fact that these dualities existed had been known before Witten came up with the idea of M-theory.

Additional amusement has come for many in guessing what the M might stand for (possibilities include Matrix, Magic, Muffin, Mystery, Mother and Membrane). Regardless of what the M might possibly mean, M-theory has become one of the most interesting and active areas of research in theoretical physics today.

[source](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory)
I had dinner with a Princeton PhD astrophysics professor, who had won the Einstein prize, and i asked him his opinion of string theory.

He said, "I have no opinion, because i would need to spend 7 years full time to familiarize myself with the underlying math, and I haven't had the time to do that."

To get to M-Theory, we have to start with String Theory. Here is the ELI5 of String Theory and M-Theory.

We have two sets of rules in our Universe right now. Quantum Mechanics, which are the rules of the REALLY small things, like things the size of atoms, or smaller, and General Relativity, which are the rules for REALLY big things, like us, and stars, that are affected by Gravity.

But when you use the rules of General Relativity in the world of the REALLY small, crazy bullshit happens. And when you use Quantum Mechanics in the world of the REALLY big, similar crazy bullshit happens.

So for now, everybody has just used Quantum Mechanics to deal with small things, and General Relativity to deal with the big things. No big deal, right?

Except, we don't live in two worlds, we live in one, with big things and small things! So why don't we have one set of rules for everything?

String Theory is our best attempt at making one set of rules for everything. It seems to work so far at combining Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity without crazy bullshit!

How does it do that? Well, when Physicists do the math on something, and the answer is infinity, it is usually a sign something is wrong (crazy bullshit), since we don't see infinity very often in real life.

So when physicists back in the day were doing calculations about certain collisions, it gave them a bunch of infinities. This was because they assumed all the force in the collisions was happening at one exact point in space. Basically a dot with no length, height, or width. If you pushed on the dot with your finger, all of the force is absorbed in that one spot, the dot. Push it hard enough, and you could push it infinitely hard in theory. But in the real world, this doesn't happen.

Several decades ago, physicists tried something else. Instead of the collision happening in one spot, with no length, height, or width, they tried to see what would happen if the collision was "spread out" over one dimension, let's say length. So instead of pushing the dot and all the force going into that, it's more like pushing a string, bending the string and spreading the force out from the start of the bend to the end. 

That may sound like a stupid idea, or one that doesn't really matter. The thing is, the spreading out of the energy GOT RID OF THE INFINITIES! 

This was a big deal! While these strings could not be found in experiments, the math worked! Over the years, this has led to String Theory.

So what about M-Theory?

So, the back in the day physics that made infinities assumed particles were dots. No length, height, or width, aka dimensions. Since it is a point with no dimensions, it is what they call a 0-Brane.

String Theory assumed particles are Strings. No height or width, just length, or what they call a 1-Brane.

When physicists took String Theory to it's limits, they found 5 completely self consistent versions of it. At the time, they assumed one was the correct one, and which one would be verified by experiment one day. 

Edward Witten, who is so unbelievably smart he figures this stuff out in his head, then writes the results on the back of a napkin, realized the five versions of String Theory were part of the same theory, much like tusks, rough skin, smooth nails, a thin tail, and a floppy trunk are all part of the same elephant!

So what exactly is M-Theory then? Well, to truly understand it you need about seven years of studying the underlying math. Since this is ELI5, remember how we had 0-Branes and 1-Branes? Well, why stop there? What about 2-Branes (particles with length and width, but no depth, like a sheet of paper)? What about 3-Branes, with length, height, and width like cubes or spheres? 4-Branes? 5-Branes? 10-Branes?

M-Theory is the study of how the Branes (or M-Branes. Membranes! Exceedingly clever!) dance with one another.

Why do we care about this? Because if proven, it could be the Theory of Everything, explaining not just what we are, but why, on a fundamental mathematical level why things can't be different than they are now (much like counting can't be different, 1=1, 2=2, etc...no matter how you count it).

TL;DR M-Theory is the study of how objects with different dimensions (some with just length, some with length and width, some with length width and height, etc...) interact, which could explain not only what we are, but why!
I profoundly doubt this could be explained to a five year old.
Below is my attempt. It omits most of the fundamental complexities but provides a solid foundation for building on, I hope.

* * *

M-theory is an attempt to explain the most basic make-up of how everything works. It is not yet complete, so we do not know if it's the correct explanation. If it's successful, it would explain why the universe is as it is, from the smallest scale (things far too tiny to see or measure) to the largest (things so vast we can barely perceive them at all). Scientists very much are interested in if it's possible to explain the universe this way because it means they can discover and explain everything. So far, we haven't succeeded in this, and many things remain undiscovered, unknown, or uncertain.

Previous attempts at explaining the universe this way have always had problems. Most explanations involve tiny particles which interact according to rules which scientists have attempted to predict and measure. Problems arise when measurements contradict the rules and tell us our explanations are incorrect. There are other problems as well, such as explaining gravity, which can be explained without particles at all.

M-theory differs in that it combines many existing explanations (like string theory) to propose that at its smallest and most fundamental level, things are made up of particles that are very complex and difficult to describe and don't behave at all like particles the way we think of them. These complicated behaviors are needed because it provides a way to describe the universe accurately.

Scientists are currently working hard to figure out if M-theory is the right explanation. They do so with lots of math, experiments, and comparing it against other explanations. They hope to either reach a point where either we can complete the explanation or prove that it's wrong (hopefully in a way that points us to the right answer).
I can derive some beta functions but that's about it
The notion of M-theory is being discussed by, among others, Edward Witten, a central figure in the superstring field. Witten describes M-theory as a conjectured theory that lies beyond superstring theory, but at the moment we only have the name, no content.

[Introduction to M-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_M-theory)
As I understand it, poorly, string theory calls for strings vibrating in 10 dimensions (the four normal ones and six tiny curled up ones we can't see) to replace our normal concept of point particles. Different vibration patterns yield different fundamental particles, so, if we knew the shape of the extra 6 dimensions, we could calculate the mass of a given particle instead of measuring it. Neat, that. 

M-theory added an 11th dimension and replaced strings with higher dimensional branes (or Membranes). Mathematically it showed that the five different string theories were all related in some way. 

PBS currently has the [video versions](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/elegant-universe.html) of Briane Greene's Elegant Universe available free on their website. At 50 minutes each, this is probably the closest thing to an ELI5 of M Theory.
I think you should read this book to get a clear idea about everything related to string theory : https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Universe-Superstrings-Dimensions-Ultimate/dp/039333810X


Going to try for a literal 5-year-old.

First let's say what string theory does. Go get the jump rope. I'll hold one end fixed and you stand over there and shake the other end to get a pattern going. We'll count how many full waves we see.

Does this and sees open string modes.

So in string theory, this is what is happening at the very tiny tiny scale. Way smaller than an atom. The string is stretched between branes. That is like when I was holding one end fixed. There are certain patterns that can show up and those are the modes of that string.

Those different modes are treated like different things in nature like the different pieces of atoms but even smaller. So we imagine that there are lots of these little stings and branes everywhere replacing all those particles.

I think that's enough for today.

I had a secondary school teacher do this demonstration of open string standing waves when introducing quantum so credit there.
The biggest problem with the term "String Theory" and hence "M Theory" is that neither are theories in the normally accepted sense, "Framework" would be a better term. This is before getting into the terminal problems of the String approach such as the Landscape and lack of any conceivable testable prediction.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory - its way above my understanding of physics, but this link explains it in its most currently understood form. 
I do find it very fascinating regardless of complexity.

Edit: added M-Theory.

Enjoy.
There are two different currents in a pn junction, diffusion current and drift current. Diffusion current is caused by the different concentration of charge carriers. Electrons will move to the p region while holes will move to the n region. If the holes and the electrons combine an ion is left behind. Positive ions in the n region and negative ions in the p region creating an electric field from n (positive) to p (negative).


Drift current is the movement of charge carriers in an electric field. If an electron wants to move from the n region to the p region the drift current will try to push it back into the n region. The same goes for the holes. These two currents will cancel each other out eventually resulting in a depletion zone.


Electrons and holes will still move around by diffusion but upon entering the depletion zone they will be pushed back by the electric field resulting in the drift current. The carriers outside of the depletion zone will stay in their respective regions and move around. Most of the charge carriers will just move around in random directions which means no current. Only the charge carriers in the vicinity of the depletion region will create a diffusion current.
One concept that I think isn't taught early enough or clearly enough in most textbooks is how the fermi level relates to the concentration of electrons or holes. The closer the fermi level is to the conduction band, the higher the concentration of free electrons. To draw a band diagram in equilibrium, you start by drawing the fermi level as a horizontal line because the fermi level must be constant in equilibrium. Then, you draw the conduction and valence bands on either side of the junction, and connect them with a curve

Thus, if you draw a band diagram for the pn junction in equilibrium, there is a concentration gradient as you move from the n-type side to the p-type side, since the fermi level gets farther from the conduction band, and this predicts a diffusion current by Fick's law. Far from the junction, in the quasi-neutral region, there is no concentration gradient since the distance of the fermi level from the band edges is constant.

So I think a useful interpretation of the "currents cancelling out" explanation is to imagine it as diffusion trying to happen at the depletion edge, since the carrier concentration drops rapidly there, but this process is prevented by the presence of an electric field.
It is a really long time since I did any semi-conductor theory, so I'd suggest Googling PN-Junction (e.g. [see wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction) ) - but I think once you have equilibrium the diffusion current will be "resisted" by the voltage across the junction such that there is very little current flowing across the junction.
The electric field developed across the depletion region cancels out the diffusion current. You got that right. 

But that is under zero bias equilibrium condition. 

What do you mean by backward current is the current due to the electric field in the space charge region/depletion region right? I am not getting your question right. Anyway to answer partly, there are not any free electrons in the scr but there is a potential gradient, no?


You might want to research "reverse bias" and "forward bias" to get a better understanding of how a pn junction (i.e. diode) works.
It's describing a quantum wave incident on a medium which causes some of the wave to be reflected back and some of the wave to be transmitted through the medium. The equation that allows us to do these sorts of calculations for the values of R and T are given from the schrodinger equation which is shown at the top
The figure is just flat out **wrong**.  Every kindergartner knows that 1D quantum scattering like this should be illustrated with a *steady stream of cats bouncing off the wall*.  This is just bad pedagogy.

.

.

Do I really need this?  "/s"
The green thing is a wall, a barrier.  On the left side of the wall, the 'cat wavefunction' is the superposition of an *incident* cat (black) and a *reflected* cat (white).  On the ~~left~~ right side, the wave function has just one part, a *transmitted* cat (grey). 

The cat wavefunction must satisfy certain boundary conditions at the wall which, depending on the exact nature of the wall, allow you solve for the  reflection coefficient *R*,  and the transmission coefficient *T*.  Conservation of probability (or matter) demand *|R|^2 + |T|^2 = 1*.


I would wear that on a t-shirt or a hat.
The top is the Schrodinger equation and each cat is a wave the incident (black), transmitted (grey) and reflected (white).
The cat-wavefunction analogy is obviously Schrodinger's cat. The black cat is the incident wavefunction to a classical barrier, i.e. an infinite potential, the white cat is the reflected component and the grey cat the transmitted, or tunnelled, component. 

Quantum tunnelling is basically wave-mechanical tunnelling, any wave will have a finite imaginary component in the forbidden region. Provided that region isn't too thick the wavefunction will realise a real component on the other side, albeit of lower amplitude. Hence the cat being grey I guess, although a wavefunction is a probability density so the cat should be the same colour but sort fo stretched out in the shape of, well a wave-function, and the plotted with axes and just as a line, not a cat.
Basically it's talking about a cat (black) hitting a wall and getting both reflected (white) and transmitted (grey) according to the probability given by Schroedinger's equation (up top). It's not a great visualization.
Man, the black-white-grey of that diagram just doesn't help at all, what a strange choice.
In case it helps, this was the image used for the Exploring Quantum Physics course on Coursera (an excellent course, in my opinion).
Is there a t-shirt of this?
I'm not that familiar with quantum mechanics, but it appears to be describing a quantum wave.

(I do have a physics degree, but that was so long ago that I have forgotten all the good bits)
Energy is conserved in some sense in GR, to be precise it is covariantly conserved, that is [; \nabla\_{\mu} T\^{\mu\nu} = 0;], were [;\nabla;] is the covariant derivative and [;T\^{\mu\nu};] is the stress energy tensor. If we introduce a space-time split and look at the zero component [; (\partial\_{\mu} - \Gamma\^{\sigma}_{\mu\sigma}) T\^{\mu 0}=0;] we find the Levi-Cevita term which looks a lot like a source term. However we can always find coordinates such that the Levi-Cevita connection and its first derivative vanish, so in GR energy is conserved locally in freely falling coordinates. 

However, we may not care about locally or free falling. In that case we can look at asymptotically flat spacetimes, where Stokes theorem tells us that energy is conserved at the boundary, so as much energy enters a region of spacetime as leaves. In that case we may be able to do something useful in the region where space is not flat. Like reordering iron atoms. In that case 2 kg iron enter the spacetime region, 2 kg iron leave, so energy is conserved. The second law of thermodynamics may forbid this, but to the best of my knowledge the generalization of the second law to curved spacetime including backreaction is a unsolved problem.  Or to put it slightly differently, energy conservation does not care if we forge a sword in the non-euclidean pits of  R'lyeh, but probably we have to shake the universe in the form of entropy released as gravitational waves to satisfy thermodynamics. 
Hello. Student of general relativity here, and I am still very much learning the subject so I would like an answer to this question, too. I would like to make a couple statements about my understanding of things so anyone who is more knowledgeable, correct me! :D

My understanding is that when you have a dynamical spacetime, the energy associated with a particle moving through that dynamical spacetime is not conserved.

This week I was looking at Killing vectors. It seems to me that if we have a spacetime with a Killing vector associated with the time component of the metric, we can use Noether's theorem to define conservation of energy in that system. Do I have that right?

If I do, when we talk about a "dynamical" spacetime...does this imply that there are no Killing fields present? Meaning that there is no isometry? Meaning that there is no conservation of anything (energy or momentum)?

Any clarification would be great, thanks!
How disappointing.
Doesn't "dark matter" simply stand for a variable in certain equations that represents something we can't detect/measure? To me it would make more sense to rework these equations from existing and known particles/forces, rather than rely on a phantom element(dark matter) to support the equations.

Looking for a good introduction to linear response theory at about a graduate level, preferably with a focus on applications in quantum and condensed matter physics. Anyone got any suggestions/recommendations?

Hello guys! please recommend me a quantum field theory book. I find peskin & schroeder too hard for me at the current moment. THank you!
Hello! Can anyone recommend me a good solid state textbook? 
I'm starting to work my way through Gravitation, are there any especially good lecture series to complement it?
I want to understand the Dirac field better than I do. Peskin and Schroder and Tong's notes did an alright job of getting me to turn the crank but I really want to be able to grok it. Does anyone know of a good text that introduces the Dirac field and spinors alongside the requisite representation theory and geometry to really understand it?

I've had some differential topology, so I'm comfortable with Lie group and Lie algebras, bundles and the like. I'm looking for something more math-focused than Peskin and Schroeder, for instance. 
I'm looking for a physics book to pick up. Complete beginner to physics (I know virtually nothing). I'm very comfortable with single variable calculus, though, so the math won't be the bottleneck. I'm in a basic physical science course in college and it's more challenging than I expected.
In the absence of net external forces\*, the centre of mass moves with constant velocity, so that the centre of mass frame is a very convenient frame because it's inertial. Then, in the COM frame the body can only rotate about the COM, because the rotation about any other point would mean the COM moves.

* including inertial forces!
Rotational not around the center of mass requires an external force. Also separation of variables allows one to deal with translation and rotation(s) indepenently.

If you can afford to lose some pumping capacity you could just stick a grid or something in the middle of the tube.
I once heard that Paul got the idea for this when he was carrying a hard boiled egg up the stairs on a tray for his wife, and realized he could get the egg to balance better if he jostled the tray periodically (might have been Penning though).
haha just read about paul trap in the connection of ion trap quantum computers. helped abit for the understanding, because it was abit unclear why i need the RF for it, but i understand it now.

its always interesting how physicists in the past gained ideas to solve things like that.
That's how the particles in the trap get their spin? /s^(scnr)
This was a great demonstration, really enjoyed it.
I went for an interview with a company making quantum computers.  They trap the entangled charged particles in this way and move them around the "CPU" like this.

They briefly explained their Paul Trap, to which I replied:

Me: "Ah, yeah, you can't comb your hairy balls"

Interviewer: "....what?"

Me: "Hairy balls, sir.  You can't comb them flat.  Imagine having a hairy ball and trying to comb it so that all the hair lies flat.  You can't do it - you'd always end up with a spike of hair somewhere.  That's why you need to keep shifting the hair about to keep the excess hair moving about".

I didn't get a second interview.

(it's a [real thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem) - but they'd never heard of it)
>I = VR may be the most familiar form of Ohm’s law, but it is far from the only one.

I certainly hope it's not the most familiar!

On a more serious note, Ohm's Law is a law for ohmic devices, and it's very useful (wires are ohmic!). The ideal gas law doesn't apply for real gases. Is the ideal gas law then not a law?
There are many similar examples, but one shouldn't suggest that a law is misnamed when observations defy it. Take the ideal gas law:

http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/3311/3391331/blb1009.html

The purpose of a law is to generalize observations that happen under some conditions, but it need not provide guarantees about it's own accuracy. It's even difficult to find any law that holds well under a wide range of conditions. Edit: valenaut beat me to it!
you could write a followup article on hooke's law.

In case you can't access the full paper, the PDF is also hosted [here](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/rappegroup/publications/Papers/Spanier16pASAP.pdf).

In this paper, researchers are describing a newish type of solar cell that for the first time is showing reasonably high efficiencies. Most conventional solar cells operate on what is called the [photovoltaic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_effect). The basic idea is shown [in this diagram](http://i.imgur.com/eAnDYGD.png?1). The simplest cell will be made up of a semiconducting material with a given bandgap. Light can then come in and excite an electron from the valence band into the conduction band leaving a hole behind. To a good approximation you can assume that most photons with an energy higher than the band gap will be absorbed, but all photons with a smaller energy will be lost. The cell is then hooked up two an external circuit so that the electron can go one way, the hole the other way, creating a current which can then do useful work.

Of course, for any solar cell what you really want to maximize is the power you can get out given by the current x voltage (i.e. IV). In conventional solar cells the current is proportional to the number of photons absorbed. On the other hand, the voltage will be determined by the bandgap (higher bandgap, higher V). So now there is a tradeoff. You want the bandgap to be as small as possible so you can collected as much light as possible, but you also want the bandgap to be high so the voltage can be high. The maximum power conversion efficiency (energy generated per input of solar energy) as determiend by Shockley–Queisser looks [like this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/ShockleyQueisserFullCurve.svg). There is a sweet spot around 1eV where you can get the most power out. Most high performance solar cells, e.g. silicion cells, fall in that range. 

Now in this work researchers used a material called [barium titanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_titanate) as the active material. Barium titanate looks like a white powder, which suggests that it would be awful for PV applications. However, in this study researchers got a power conversion efficiency of close to 5%! As the lead researcher describes it:
>“Barium titanate absorbs less than a tenth of the spectrum of the sun. But our device converts incident power 50 percent more efficiently than the theoretical limit for a conventional solar cell constructed using this material or a material of the same energy gap.”

In other words, as per the title of the paper, they beat the Shockley–Queisser for barium titanate by quite a bit. The reason this was possible is that these cells operate based on the [anomalous PV effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_photovoltaic_effect). That effect is still not well understood, but it relies on a material having a crystal structure without a center of symmetry (e.g. a ferroelectric material). In these materials, the voltage under applied light can be much higher than the bandgap of the material. The downside is that the current is usually very low. In this particular study both the voltage and current were sufficiently high for the first time to really show respectable performance. 

Tl;Dr: A newish type of solar cell shows much higher performance than similar cells in the past and much better than what can be predicted using the conventional photovoltaic effect. It's too early to tell how far this technology can go, but the result is pretty cool nonetheless.
The only way I can think of to beat Shockley-Queisser would be for a carrier, high up in the band from a photon with energy >> Egap to kick more carriers across the gap. This way would get back some of the energy otherwise lost to heat in a single junction cell.  

They get some kind of charge separation that sets up a field. Maybe the distance the carriers travel before they thermalize is dependent on their excess energy, and this is a way to get some of that back.

The photocurrent spectrum is very very narrow and not well-matched to sunlight at all.  Total efficiencies need to be calculated with a solar spectrum. This is why a 1 junction, with optimum bandgap, can only ever be 37%. For a laser, right above the bandgap, the quantum efficiency would be close to 100% for any good semiconductor solar cell. 


The simple answer is that it takes more force to breach the sides of the barrel than it does to push the water out of the way. Some guns will explode if shot with a barrel full of water, though. A 12 gauge shotgun with a slug round shot underwater could possibly explode, for example.
Awwww yeeeeeeaa
> Hey, I was wondering, why we hear some sounds of an event almost immediately?

You should realize that that video has artificially synchronized sound and picture. The original recording has a long delay between picture and sound due to the distance to the camera.

> ... however the big bang occurs a few seconds later. Why?

The first explosion is in the upper stage, which has limited fuel and oxidizer to support a large explosion. The second explosion takes place in the lower stage, which has much more fuel and oxidizer available.
The pop may have been the initiating event.  If it ocurred a few seconds before the main explosion the sound of it might have arrived at the camera simultaneously with the flash from the main explosion.  The BANG from the main explosion then arrived at the camera a few seconds later yet.

In my opinion, the best way to change the public's perception and misuse of physics is to become an educator or a scientific popularizer - but this rarely works unfortunately. If you are an educator, then you will most likely be teaching scientifically literate people, a notable minority. While a scientific popularizer is much more influential, becoming one is pretty improbable. 

An effective method would be to hit these groups, specifically the Daily Mail, where it hurts -- their wallet. Spreading and sharing these links, you are aiding the propagation, although I know you don't mean to, of the very problems you wish to avoid. Most of the time, the best way to get rid of something is to patiently ignore it because drawing attention to it only attracts the 'crackpots' as superforms put it. 

As for your career, becoming an educator that involves in outreach and is mindful of the dangers of propagating poor science is *an* option and, in my opinion, its the most effective one. 

Sorry to be such a downer, hope this helps.
School generally doesn't present competing, minority views in science and tends to teach as though a certain way of thinking is a done deal.

Hopefully you're better than that.  Controversies are good for science, even if you think otherwise.  In this case, QM is not a done deal and there is definitely a lot of ambiguity that is getting dusted under the carpet. In every conventional theory there are gaps and weaknesses that need to addressed that often aren't.  Controversies force the issue because people with competing theories won't let you get away with anything.  You either get down into the weeds with them or concede defeat by burying their viewpoint. 

Even biblical creationists can be helpful in this process by exposing the soft underbelly of evolutionary theory and exploiting its weaknesses. They are always questioning the validity of evidence. This is a good thing.  It helps prevent group think and forces scientists to confront issues they'd rather ignore. The fights in these areas of science strengthen the science overall.

The very best thing you can do is let it play out.
Don't let the "leave it alone" and "you can't change minds" crowds discourage you.  Look at video bloggers like Veritasium, Smarter Every Day and Sci Show just to name three. There are people in this world who have dedicated themselves to science education and I suspect their reach and impact is subtle but huge.  The Tysons and Sagans and Krausses of the world are awesome too (heroes to me!)  and they speak from a place of Real Science Authority(tm) but realize that making stuff clear doesn't require knowing everything so much as it requires knowing how to reach out and explain things in vivid images and compelling metaphors that serve as "intuition pumps"  (h/t to Daniel Dennett).   Take science classes, video classes, and above all, writing classes.   That's my two cents.   (disclaimer:  former physics major here.)
> Not even classes in QM, but just basic scientific reasoning skills so that people can spot this kind of thing. 

That's even more ambitious (and more worthwhile) than the first goal you stated. Teaching critical thinking, the role of the null hypothesis, skepticism and other properties of scientific thinking would produce a massive and beneficial change in society -- so massive that many groups with political power would object and resist. Those would be the same groups who are already objecting to the heretical idea of teaching evolution in elementary school.

> What kind of career should I be looking into? Teaching? Outreach, perhaps at a museum or doing talks at schools, or through starting my own business?

To me, the most influential spokespeople for a rational outlook happen to fall by chance into that role -- Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Carl Sagan (Tyson's mentor when he was a teenager), Lawrence Krauss and others have public respect and a kind of authority that, although contrary to a scientific outlook, improves their chance to be heard.

My point is this is not something one can sign up for, it's more circumstantial and probabilistic. But this shouldn't discourage you from speaking out in any venue that presents itself, and training yourself in critical thinking for purely personal reasons.
The article you posted with 11k views is most definitely not misusing anything. It reports on a realization of wheelers delayed choice experiment, which proves that a particle can have no objective existence before it is measured, unless you accept some crackpot theory like Pilot Wave(physical things are moving faster than light in discontinuous trajectories or even back in time) or MWI (the wavefunction, abstract math, is magically real or physical). The professor who ran the experiment stated that reality does not exist until it is measured. Even pilot wave is ruled as implausible by recent experiment, unless you believe physical things can travel faster than light. 

It isn't so much that things are being misused by others, but that your worldview is being proven less and less tenable as time goes on. 
This reminds me of how fiber optic cables have a refractive index that is a function of radius. I think at a fixed radius it changes discontinuously enough to cause a reflection so that as little light leaves through the sides as possible.
I just want to say how much I love your black board.
That title alone is giving me anxiety. Fuck lenses.
Reading makes me sad.  Could you go into what specifically makes these lenses impossible?  Is it the max index?  If so, what would each lens look like as it approached the theoretical maximum?
If you mean glass in the amorphous silicon dioxide sense, then I can't help you. But, I can share the first thing I thought of: [Approaching theoretical strength in glassy carbon nanolattices](http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v15/n4/full/nmat4561.html). (Sorry that this is probably not what you want, but glassy carbon is just so cool!)
I hope this is the right place to ask this. This question is more geared for theoretical physicists, but really anyone can answer.  I'm just looking for a variety of methods.

I am just starting research into theoretical cosmology (I'm a second year grad student).  My main question is how other people go about reading and understanding papers.  Right now, my method is to read it once, then go through it in detail (i.e. trying to confirm equations, looking for important claims, etc.).  However, I don't feel like I'm really getting much from this.  I'll finish my notes and third read through, but I still won't feel like I'm understanding the point of the paper.  Any ideas?

Would it be better to go to a college for undergrad then transfer for post-gradschool work or attend a college that offers higher degrees themselves?

Edit: Okay, thank you.
I just started my first year in electrical and communication engineering, and all my professors keep saying the same thing i.e to keep up to date with what's happening in my field. His do I actually do that ? Also what stuff should I read up outside my university course ?

Applying to grad school right now, and deciding between computational vs experimental.

Basically, should you enjoy doing day-to-day experimental stuff to go into experimental? I took a laboratory electronics course that I did well in, but didn't really get excited about. I did research in an optics lab, and the experimental portion of it was pretty miserable (didn't have clear direction, my experiments didn't work, aligning optics is not fun, and sitting alone in a dark room is not fun). 

In contrast, I enjoy coding and have enjoyed the computational projects I'm on. But I want to go into industry after a PhD, and always hear that experimentalists are in much higher demand than theorists or computationalists. I'm also conflicted because I really one of my current projects, which is doing computational design of devices. I don't think it's a project a computational group would work on, but if I joined an experimental group I would imagine I'd have to do the experimental portion as well. In hindsight, this feels dumb to type out, but I'm curious if experiment is something people "put up with" or enjoy.

Has anyone here managed to skip MsC to enter PhD in Europe? There's an agreement between my the colleges of my country (Chile) and Germany that allows this but im looking for practical cases since i am in my last undergrad semester and my advisor always tells me that doing a MsC is a waste of time.

For Europeans who applied to US grad schools, how did you know which universities to choose? By that I mean how did you know how good your application was and what schools you could realistically get into.

I have just graduated from a 4 year undergrad in theoretical physics from a school typically ranked 50-150 on those university ranking sites with a first class hon degree (78% overall, really high scores in QFT, standard model and computation courses 80/90%+, but lower scores in condensed matter stuff and some pure maths 60//70%).

I have had 2 summer internships for the last two years both in lattice QCD. The first was in my university and the second one was a fairly prestigious HPC internship in europe under under a well known professor in the field. I want to go to school which has lattice QCD but I have no clue what schools I could apply to or where to even start looking.

I will be sitting the GRE on the 17th and I am only starting to study properly now, I have done two practice tests over the last 2 months but not seriously and didn't find them too difficult but my optics and electronic knowledge is pretty awful.

Will my application be completely dependent on this score and will I be able to wait for the score before I pick the schools?

If anyone (NA or EU) has any advice on what schools I should look at, what scores I need in the GRE, tips for the GRE or anything you think useful it would be greatly appreciated.
I am thinking about going for a Ph.D in plasma physics to get into fusion research,but I did not get any experience in the subject as an undergrad. Will this affect my ability to pursue this in grad school?

Also, I had a weird undergrad curriculum and there is a chance the I could be required to take more undergrad classes when I get accepted to a school. Could anyone give me insight into how that would work?
What factors should I consider when choosing a topic for my master's thesis? I had a great time doing my bachelor's thesis and I have talked to my Bachelor supervisor about possible master's topics and narrowed it down to two.

One would be a very interesting theoretical topic continuing my bachelor research, but I don't have access to experimental data to actually compare the theory to. This topic would also be in line with most of the lectures I listened to in my master's program.

The other one would be theoretical work outside of what I have learned about so far (I had one related lecture), but it is in collaboration with another large interdisciplinary institute and I could do lab work to directly check my results. 

I will work on the thesis for a year and will start next year, so I do have time to get into a more unknown topic.

What were the deciding factor when you chose your thesis topics? I'm really stuck and need some new ideas to help me decide.
So, I'm looking for some general advice as to what else I can do to distinguish myself from my peers, as I know that admissions into the top PhD programs and beyond are extremely competitive.

My current situation is:

 - Second year of a BSc (Australian degree) with majors in Physics and Applied Maths, and a good GPA (7.0).

 - I have suggested to some of the staff to take some tutorial type classes for first years, and they're looking into it now for next year.

 - I've already done one research project with a paper currently in preparation, and have applied for some more projects both around Australia and at my own university to do this year.

 - I'm currently heading towards astronomy, but that is only because of said previous experience (not really an explicit choice as my university only really has astrophysicists, not even a single theoretical one). 

I'm not sure what else there is that I can do right now, and whilst classes are good and necessary, they're not actively helping me to improve my CV or stand out from everyone else. 

Are there any particularly good programs I should be looking into (ones that accept Aus students and preferably don't strain budget too much; I'm pretty poor)? Are there events I should be aiming to attend? Right now, I think I need to make my name more visible and build connections, but I don't know where to even begin.
I'm not gonna try to butcher an explanation here, but these videos from PBS Space Time delve deeply into what you're talking about – the forces at play in expansion and the balance between their magnitudes: 

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPUh22kYmNA6WUmOsEEi32zi_RdSUF4i
> Will a flat universe containing both matter and radiation always be dominated by radiation at early times and matter at late times?

That depends. Does this flat universe have a Big Bang? One can imagine a flat universe that didn't start that way.

Or are you describing this flat universe? If so, assuming a Big Bang, then yes -- such a universe begins with all mass-energy already present, extremely concentrated, which means the forces we see around us are completely overwhelmed by unified versions of those forces that result from the early mass-energy concentration. All this argues for very high energy levels, no atoms as we understand the term, and an opacity resulting from the absence of atoms able to emit and absorb photons.

Then, making one more assumption, i.e. that the universe expands forever, the old universe will be dominated by matter. But until recently that was an unanswered question -- 30 years ago one could argue that the universe might cycle endlessly between high and low density. Dark Energy seems to have eliminated that idea.
How capable is your simulator, actually? How many qubits can it run? Is it able to run something like Shor's algorithm?
I modeled an evaporating black hole as a quantum system using python for my masters thesis. So this program interested me. I was curious as to whether you used qutip? Quickly glancing at your code I can see you didn't so I was wondering if you have heard of it. It is a quantum toolbox for python, and was invaluable for when I was coding my model. 

At the time I could only model a black hole to 5 particles (qubits) in size so I'm interested to running this model and seeing how they compare in computational power. 

All in all I love* this project, it looks amazing

Edit: live to love
This is a nice simple simulator. Make the vectors, make the matrices, multiply 'em together, sample the results.

You can simplify the 'generate gates' function by using the [kronecker product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product), which is in numpy as [`np.kron(m1, m2)`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.kron.html). For example, the 4-qubit matrix to hit the third qubit out of four with an X gate is:

    import numpy as np
    I = np.eye(2)
    X = np.mat([[0,1],[1,0]])
    X_third_of_4 = reduce(np.kron, [I, I, X, I])

This doesn't quite work on CNOTs, since you want to move the control independently of the X but controls don't have a matrix (they're operation modifiers, not operations). But you can cheat by [marking the unmet control cases with NaNs then fixing the marked values](http://algorithmicassertions.com/impractical-experiments/2015/05/17/Treating-Controls-like-Values.html):

    import numpy as np
    def nanToEye(m):
        n = m.shape[0]
        return np.mat([[m[i,j] if not np.isnan(m[i,j]) else 1 if i == j else 0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)])

    I = np.eye(2)
    X = np.mat([[0,1],[1,0]])
    C = np.mat([[float('nan'), 0], [0, 1]])
    CNOT_second_onto_fourth_of_6 = nanToEye(reduce(np.kron, [I, C, I, X, I, I]))

That's a [very dramatic title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness).  Please consider using a toned down version of the article's title when posting to /r/physics.  Thanks.
Having degrees in economics, finance and physics, I can tell you it is always benefitial to seek additional knowledge. If you choose to go the econometrics route it might not even be statistics that ends up being benefitial to you. 
That being said, I often found that statistical analysis in any economic subfield seemed to be a lot less rigorous than in physics. You probably wont gain much beyond some general practice in data analysis. On the other hand the econ guys really do have a hand for model building so you might want to hang out with some of those profs and see how they work.

I would also recommend to think about going the finance route. Not just because finance degrees can land you very nice jobs if you ever feel like you had enough of physics, but also because there are some mathematical tools that directly stem from physics. E.g.: The black-scholes equation that was used for pricing derivatives (resulting in the 1997 nobel prize for its "inventors") is basically a heat diffusion equation and has been known to physicists for a long time.
Examples?
It would be helpful if you cited examples of such methods since many of us have no idea what econometrics is.  

Physics has an entire, well-developed subfield called Statistical Mechanics, which has been solving physics problems as long, if not longer than statistics have been solving economic problems.  
This is a pre-print, not a peer-reviewed article. So, the claims should be taken with a grain of salt. 
Man, if there's one article that should have cited my higher-dimensional bubble dynamics paper, it's this one.
Neat. I'm currently working on a similar  analysis searching for black holes at CMS. At this point though, I think it's pretty safe to rule out the ADD model, most theorists have abandoned it as far as I can tell.
Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but you can treat it not as a photon gas, but as a gas consisting of photons, electrons, and positrons. At equilibrium, the electrons and positrons will have a density which goes something like T^(3)exp[-m*_e_*c^(2)/kT].

You could interpret this as "photon-photon interactions", namely pair production.

See Landau for the details.
I answered OP's question in askscience, but I don't think you'll get photon-photon interactions unless the effective temperature of the photon gas exceeds 2x511 keV.
They see the movement of nucleii, the nucleii don't change at all. Nuclei are ~1fm whereas atoms are ~0.1nm so factor 10^5 between them.. (also energies, eV vs MeV)
I just got back from there! I was helping setup some new experiments we are doing this fall with UED. Glad to see my field get some love here.
> Wasn't sure how light transferred information in any context though lol.

What we call "light" is actually electromagnetic energy, which travels freely through space and which covers a wide spectrum from wavelengths longer than AM radio through gamma rays. The conversation we're having right now is being supported by the transmission of electromagnetic radiation through optical fibers, electrical cables and thin air.

More here: [Electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation)
Obviously quantum error correction. You also want to think about what the background of the reader is. You might want to introduce some basic linear algebra. 

 I wouldn't bother with d wave. You'd have to introduce the entire computational model underlying it. Also, it would very quickly date your book when the truth finally comes out within the next few years. In general I'd be very careful with realisations.  Like if I wrote a book about programming in java, would I suddenly jump into a physics discussion about Intel's new 14nm chip?
Including some background on quantum statistical mechanics and quantum thermodynamics might be a good idea.
Honestly, there are a lot of books that do this field really well. Why do you think you need to write a book?
Machine Learning
'Merica checking in, I couldn't find a decent paying job related to physics so now I'm in an environmental engineering graduate program studying nuclear forensics. Moral of the story is that a physics background opens a lot of doors but can close others. Your mileage may vary.
Data science seems to be a popular job. Depending on what you focus on during your education, you could potentially look at software development or software engineering as well. However, keep in mind that you'd be competing with people who majored in computer science for these jobs, so it won't really be easy.
I've just graduated with a masters in the UK and been applying for jobs, the most common is definitely software engineering, so make sure you learn some programming where possible. You don't have to be a master, I've been explicitly told a lot of companies look for Physicists/Mathematicians/Engineers with strong academic backgrounds rather than computer scientists because of the difficulty of the maths in data analysis roles for example, and you can always pick up programming (likely in a new language) on the job 
Before delving into a 2016 research paper, you might consider looking into the basics of [cavity QED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavity_quantum_electrodynamics), which this article falls under. Most applications of this type of thing relate to quantum computing and other aspects of quantum information science.

One thing about cavity QED is that photons are easier to understand than photons in a vacuum, because they're basically standing EM waves.

>EM drive passes peer review

Not yet, it hasn't.  A *paper* describing White's/Eagleworks' apparatus *is rumored* to have passed peer review.  If the rumor is true, that's *not* a declaration that the drive works. 

We'll have to wait and see, hopefully they did more reversals and tried to eliminate other sources of systematic error.   But it might just be a cleaned-up version of [this report](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20140009930) previously circulated describing their apparatus and procedure.  When the paper is published, and if we all can get a copy, we can discuss it.  Until then we'll continue our moratorium on EM-drive posts.  The same ibtimes link is on the front page of /r/Futurology today.  So please click over there for the regular reddit-experience.

This comments section is soft-locked because of the drama that usually accompanies EM-drive posts.  But if anyone would like to hazard a guess as to possible uncontrolled systematic effects responsible for what White et al. is measuring, feel free. 

**Soft locked comments section:** Your comments will not be visible until a human reviews them.  Just be especially nice and remember that most people are not foil-wearing crackpots or shill's for big science.
> I was always told that momentum is the most inviolable conservation law.


This isn't related to the em drive at all and it is not an endorsement but I'd like to gently comment on the nature of conservation laws.

[Noether's theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem) tells us that we get a conservation law for each symmetry of a system. For example, if a system looks the same when you rotate around some origin, you get angular momentum conservation. If it looks the same as you walk in a straight line, you get linear momentum conservation. (I'll ignore internal symmetries of a field for now.)

So it's actually quite easy to construct situations where momentum is not conserved, depending on what you call your system.

Consider a cart on a roller coaster track. The total energy of the cart is conserved as it goes up and down in the track. But the velocity of the cart is changing, so it's momentum is not conserved.

Now, if you include the track and the earth into the system, then the *total* momentum is conserved (because the space in which we inhabit is indeed translation invariant). But my point is that conservation laws are more subtle than "this quantity is unchanging."

In the case of the EM drive, the claim is that the drive is getting momentum from nowhere, which is what makes physicists (myself included) uncomfortable.

I'm not sure why I wrote all this, but I hope it helps someone.
Ok.  I have some observations about the paper the mod linked to.

They put the cavity on one arm of a homebuilt torsion balance.  The RF electronics are on the other arm and the whole thing finds its own equilibrium position.  The balance is magnetically damped.  To make a measurement they apply a known force electrostatically and measure the displacement.  This gives them the spring constant for the torsion balance in whatever equilibrium configuration it found. Then they turn the RF on and off, tuned nominally on resonance with the cavity, and monitor the displacement.  I'm skipping a lot of details and that's why you've got to read the paper.

I see a couple of potential areas for error.  One is the magnetic damper.  There is a strong permanent magnet attached to the balance arm opposite the cavity.  Any stray DC magnetic field that is coincident with application of the RF to the cavity will tilt the balance and look just like thrust.  The authors note that they already found one such source of error and eliminated it.  But it remains an obvious entry point for error, almost a literal finger on the scale.

But the thing I immediately thought of was Faraday induced pushing off of the chamber walls and support structure.  You can float an aluminum plate above an RF generator.  I can imagine the same thing happening here.  If there is a large leakage field anywhere from the cavity or the connectors to the cavity, the leakage can induce currents in the surrounding metal via the Faraday effect and repel the source.

That's all I got now.  There are a lot of unexplained things in the report.  Hopefully, the actual paper will be more detailed.

I agree with the moratorium on reactionless drives in /r/physics .

I can understand allowing EM drive articles in places like /r/engineering  , /r/science and occasionally /r/news     but not here.    Physics is concerned primarily with descriptions of how physical systems work.  
There was an EMDrive theory paper posted here a few months ago; [I had a good time demolishing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3ajad4/new_theory_predicts_emdrive_thrust_caused_by/csdtfap).
How credible is the journal in question?

That should be fine. I don't remember anything too advanced being on the SAT so don't think a newer edition would have anything that an older wouldn't.

> When people use the term false vaccum, are they using vaccum in the same context as when people say "space is a vaccum"? If we are in a false vaccum, does that mean that space is not truly a vaccum, just very very close?

Think of a "true vacuum" as the **ground state** or lowest energy density state possible.  There is reason to believe the universe is not in the ground state but instead in a higher energy level metastable "false vacuum" state that it settled into at the very beginning of the universe (e.g., after an exponentially expansive inflationary period ended, which is the leading possibility for how this state might have occurred).  For a visual depiction of this difference, see the graphic in [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum) where the false and true states are labeled and are at shown different energy density levels separated by a barrier.

There are lots of additional details involved (e.g., see the above cited article) but that along with narnrio's reply is the basic situation.
Physics is difficult, try not to feel defeated by it because everyone hits a wall somewhere in some field and they just have to find a way around it.

It sounds like you are doing the things most people would advise you to start with but it still isn't clicking.  Any time you end up in a situation like this, where all effort seems to be making no progress take a step back and look for why you aren't grasping the concepts.  Is it that you are lacking the mathematical understanding?  Is the nomenclature eluding you?  Is it difficult to visualize these problems?  Once you identify the stumbling block you have you can begin to attempt to work past it.

If you can't find a particular skill or conceptual stumbling block then here are some other things to try:  Find another student(s) and try studying in groups, take it from a physics teacher **you are not the only one in class struggling**.  Working through problems together lets you see the approach others take to the problem and hearing other student explanations for problems can be a huge asset.  You can also try to solve a problem, then re-solve that problem and explain each step and variable assignment in detail.  Going over the material a second time in explicit terms can help you cement the concepts.  If you are having trouble with visualization you can either look for videos of the concept being demonstrated or find a physical object to help you better understand it.  For example if you are having trouble understanding torque at a conceptual level grab a pencil and a ball of playdough or clay and stick varying amounts of the clay to the end or middle of the pencil and feel how it changes how hard it is to hold up the pencil (I do this in lab classes with rolls of duct tape and meter sticks so students can get a hands on feel for the concept).
>I'm tired and I feel defeated anytime I have to go to physics because I just feel dumb and like a failure

That's normal in Physics. Partly because it's a subject that requires a different way of thinking than most subjects, but also because a lot of professors are actually pretty bad at teaching it. They've forgotten what it's like to see this material for the first time, and spend lots of class time going through proofs, which I think is pretty useless when it comes to helping students understand concepts and work out problems. Also, you're moving from one topic to another so quickly it's really difficult to fully understand what you're learning. One week you're learning about heat transfer, and the next you're learning about fluid dynamics. And then moment of inertia. In that way, the Intro courses are actually much harder than the higher level classes. Sure, the math may be more difficult in a class that's dedicated to Electricity and Magnetism, but at least it's all the same concept so you're never asking yourself "What am I even learning here?"

If you can find a study group to work with, that should help a lot. There are usually multiple ways of going about solving a problem, and learning how different people go about tackling these problems could help explain things in a way that makes sense to you. And it's a lot less draining to be with a group bouncing ideas off each other than it is sitting alone spending an hour just trying to figure out how to start working on a problem.

My general technique while in school was to find as many resources as I could to explain a concept I wasn't getting. Sometimes all it takes is hearing something explained in a particular way to make it all click for you. Or you'll go through seeing a topic explained so many different times that you find yourself able to predict what they're about to say, at which point you've got a pretty firm grasp on the material. That being said, here's a list of resources:

Somebody already mentioned [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), which all students everywhere should know about. There have been so many times I've watched a video and thought, "Wait, *that's* all there is to this!? Why did nobody just say that before??"

[Brightstorm](https://www.youtube.com/user/brightstorm2/playlists) is also great, maybe even better than Khan since topics are broken down into videos that are generally no more than 5 minutes.

[HyperPhysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html) is also pretty nice, with physics topics broken down succinctly and example problems where you can even put numbers in to find the result.

There's also the [Physics Hypertextbook](http://physics.info/) which I admit I haven't really used myself, but it looks like a nice resource with plenty of links that lets you go right towards whatever topic is giving you trouble.

[Schaum's Physics Outline](https://www.amazon.com/Schaums-Outline-College-Physics-Outlines/dp/0071754873) is a book that has lots of problems on any possible type of problem you're going to encounter. Once you see that most problems within a chapter are just the same variation on 3 or 4 different equations, you'll realize a lot of problems are deceptively simple. You'd have to pay for it, but I swear it's worth every penny.

[The Feynman Lectures](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) are a nice Physics resource. If you're not already familiar, Feynman was brilliant when it came to breaking down high level physics topics in ways that anybody could understand. Even his book on Quantum Electrodynamics is written so that anybody could learn from it. One particular example I remember from that book goes something like, "Imagine you've got a spinning clock, and at every moment in time you draw an arrow in the direction the smallest hand is pointing. Then you put all those arrows in a row, and you can see how the direction traveled by fitting all the arrows together. Imagine that, we learned something about light just by drawing some damned arrows."

[EdX](https://www.edx.org/) has courses that anybody can sign up for, for free and without obligation. These are courses that contain lectures and notes from prestigious universities like Harvard and MIT. I find it helpful to sign up for a course and raid their materials for notes and video lectures, then drop the course when I get what I'm looking for.

And on that note, you can try searching YouTube for Walter Lewin. He's also well known for being a good Physics lecturer. I'm personally rather indifferent about his lectures, but lots of other people think he's great so I'll mention him. In fact, just go on YouTube and search for physics terms until you find a particular channel that you like.

[Paul's Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) is great for math topics on advanced math like Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations.

[Purple Math](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/index.htm) is also a  math site that's just really great at visualizing the information and making even really advanced topics easily digestible.

For more math resources, [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) used to be great a few years ago but now they make you get an account and you need to pay for more than one solution per day. However, [Mathway](https://mathway.com/), [SymboLab](https://www.symbolab.com/solver/equation-calculator), [Cymath](https://www.cymath.com/), [The Derivative Calculator](http://www.derivative-calculator.net/) and [this Microsoft program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15702) are all online math programs that allow you to input a problem, and it will show not just the solution but the steps to get to that solution. Of course it's worth noting that you don't want to use this too much as a crutch to get your homework done without putting in any thought or effort, but it's a great tool for when you're stuck on a problem and need to see how to get to a particular solution. So hopefully you'll use it responsibly.

[Educator](https://www.educator.com/) is also really good at providing relatively short videos on a range of topics. I've only really browsed through their videos on DE but they did a really good job at breaking down complex problems in a way that I think even a high schooler could understand.

[Simple Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is another one I haven't used much myself, but I'm sure could be useful given how regular Wikipedia pages on science and technology are often written above even my level of understanding.

[Chegg](https://www.chegg.com/) is a pay site, but it has textbook solutions you can use. Unfortunately it changed its ratings system for their problems a while back in a way that made the site nearly worthless, but it can still help you get an idea for how to work a problem out.
I remember wishing I could go back to myself in my first couple of years at university and tell me this nugget I'm about to tell you.

If you ever don't understand something straight away, don't try to, instead just learn the maths and theory and move on.

It will become clear, but only by continuing with subject, and then applying it in examples. I remember lots of times feeling stupid that I spent so long agonising over basic stuff, when just applying it for a while was enough.

It's also just how your brain works, if something didn't click it probably won't until you come back to it later. 

There's also a bit of a trap at any level in physics to overcomplicate things and/or constantly seek a fundamental understanding. That's putting the cart before the horse, just take one thing at a time and keep the ball rolling.

In a way you're right to find the basic concepts difficult, but you only learn why by accepting them on face value and using them.
Khan academy has single-handedly taught me everything I have ever needed to know about any course I have ever struggled in. 
Join a study group. Often times professors don't really know how to explain things at a basic level. Understanding how your peers do problems though can be very helpful.


I would recommend trying the [Feynman technique](https://www.scotthyoung.com/learnonsteroids/grab/TranscriptFeynman.pdf).

Very simply put, it consists of "pretending" you're teaching someone who knows less than you about the subject matter - so you basically need to explain everything very clearly and using the simplest terminology possible. This technique is great for identifying the specific parts of the material that you don't understand, so it allows you to ask better and more focused questions, as opposed to just saying "I don't get this, please explain General Relativity all over again". You can do it with writing or just speaking out loud, it has worked both ways for me.

Hope that helps.
When I had problems, I read 3-5 different books on the same subject, since they often explain the same problem from a different POV. I after that I jumped to math and went through equations few times...just trying to understand every step and compared it with the written theory. After that I searched for explained examples - tried to solve the problem by myself. It really helped me that I didn't feel discouraged, but I felt challenged when I didn't understand something.
Most solutions to physical problems you will encounter in physics have some fundamental laws underpinning them.
One approach I found successful for myself was to try and see, for any given equation/scenario/problem, how things like conservation of energy or conservation of momentum are represented. The conservation laws are intuitive and finding how they apply can help make complex equations intuitive too.
Keep looking over examples and doing problems with guided solutions. At some point the physics should just click, or, at the least, you understand the methodology to solve them and pass the class.
This is completely from my point of view:         
I think for Physics, you need to understand the basics/concepts properly. Idk the right word, but if you just read or try to breeze through, at a point, you will have no idea what you are dealing with. Everything builds on. To solve a problem, you start with what you have and if your basics/concepts is clear, you know how to tackle it, Even if you dont know how to exactly solve at first, you can break the problem in to smaller problems and try to solve one step at a time.            
When i came to grad school, i had few of the concepts not so clear and had to spend extra time in learning them properly which was time well spent. Also, different people learn differently, may be the way some of these concepts i learnt in undergrad was not clicking to me but the way my friends explained it to me helped a lot.. So, try to find someone who can explain you. You can ask your classmates about how they understand few things you have hard time to understand. Their analogy or understanding might help you understand it better. 
It's a skill. Skills get better with practice. Block some time out daily to practice. Do your homework until you don't need the book. 
Physics can be counterintuitive until you "get it."

One novel approach to understanding the basics is this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Cartoon-Guide-Physics/dp/0062731009).
I saw this post on a random selection, I'm not a physicist out nothing in particular. But today I was listening to this podcast call startalk with Niel Degrasse Tyson and he and his guess we're talking about multiverse and quantum physics. His cohost, which is a comedian, said he had no idea what they were talking about, so Niel replied that most ppl really don't and if they think they do it's because they don't, that most ppl just stick with doing the math and memorising. It's kinda dumb and maybe unrelated, but I hope it helps
When you take notes, do you *really* understand everything you are writing down? Are you able to derive every step that they are showing you? Do you just copy down what is written or are you able to follow the logic precisely, even being able to repeat it the day after?

When you attempt problems, do you try for a few minutes before giving up and looking at the answer sheets to 'learn how to do it next time'? Or do you stare at it for hours on end, refusing to give up, trying a bunch of different things until at some point it all clicks?

These were the biggest things I learned in my undergraduate. The first few years were spent going through the motions of learning, but not actually making sure it stuck.

Being able to repeat and understand every single piece of a derivation and spending hours on a single problem that I was stuck on was in the end how I managed to push through and get a good grade. Before that, I was just going through the motions. Yes, it was painful, but also made me a good physicist.

Physics is like a sport, the only way you get better is practice. Doing practice problems helps shape your conceptual knowledge and intuition.
Physics requires a certain level of meta cognition that most people don't naturally use. It sounds fancy but badically this means assessing your own learning by asking yourself why you got this problem wrong? Which concepts or key words am I having trouble with? Do I need a refresher on what this concept is? If you think along those lines while studying and solving problems you will have more success 
To be honest, even as a graduate student I have difficulties understanding a physical concept at times. Physics, for all of its traits pertaining to the real world, can be an abstract subject to learn. At the core, I believe that the issue comes from not developing the correct physical intuition, because the mathematics is usually pretty straightforward.

That being said, learning physics can be rewarding if taught properly. The first thing that I did to learn physics more effectively was to identify what type of learner I am. That is, do I understand concepts better if it is presented in an auditory way, a visual way, or if I teach myself. I found that, personally, teaching myself and watching physics content was the best way to learn.

Identifying your preferred way of learning goes a long way to understanding the subject. This might not help, but consider taking some time to ask yourself, "why am I doing better in other classes? what do I do differently when studying for my other classes?" and incorporate those answers into the way you study physics.

Other than that, I feel for you since you're really doing all that you can to learn the subject. I hope this helps!
What level of physics are we talking about here? You say you don't get the basics, but you must be exaggerating, right? You know Newton's Laws. You know what displacement, velocity, and acceleration are. Correct?
I believe Feynman said "If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you really don't." (Or something to that effect) I believe there are a lot of thing like that in physics.
Program what you learn. Once the behavior emerges correctly in the simulation that is a validation more valuable than any test that you understand the nature of the concept.
very carefully
Anywhere that mathematical modeling is used there will be physicists employed to some degree.
There is frequent cross over between medical research and biophysics, which is often done from a computational or theoretical perspective. With respect to genetics, biophysics probably is the most direct route to study this subject from a theoretical viewpoint. 

If you were willing to entertain working with modeling, mathematical biology is quite close to medical physics in a variety of ways. Not only can only obtain a PhD in mathematical biology after an undergraduate in physics (although this is difficult), mathematical biologists often work in imaging, genetics, protein folding, neuroscience, and in population dynamics. 
So your model is of a cylinder with liquid in it, rotating, and you want to simulate the shape of the surface. Yes?

Because the model is relatively simple, you have two choices -- you can create an analytical model that accepts the cylinder's dimensions and rotation rate, then model the surface using closed-form equations, or you can create a numerical model that solves a rather complex time-based differential equation that models the liquid surface in sections that interact with each other.

In many cases a numerical model is simpler than a closed-form solution (where one exists) but in this case I suspect that the reverse is true. The liquid surface numerical model would need to be broken into sections, the more the better, each interacting with its neighbors. A closed-form analytical solution would model the liquid surface as a parabola whose properties would be determined by the rate of rotation -- a relatively easy model to create.

If your assignment is to create a numerical model, then you have no choice about it. But if the nature of the model is up to you, I would suggest examining both options to see which produces the most useful information.

I'm not a computational physics major but I finished several courses on computational physics (introduction to computational physics during my BSc and computational soft matter physics and computational many body physics during my Master's), my brother graduated in Computer Science.
I can't really tell you about job chances but what I noticed is that while my brother is much stronger on the theoretical side of software development (you can basically tell all my applications were written by a scientist and not by a CS major) and he'll know about the methods for machine learning etc.pp., he regularly consults me when it comes to data analysis and even some numerical methods.

So his CS degree prepared him way better for actually writing good code and designing applications (from a code perspective, not visually) and he knows the theory behind all of this way better then me. On the other hand my physics degree in general and computational physics courses in particular have given me more tools and knowledge about actual data analysis and writing codes for physics simulations.

These degrees are actually very different from one another, if you take some introductory courses in physics and CS you should be able to tell which of them you like more. (for a degree in computational physics you will need to like "normal" physics as well)
Disclaimer: Current physics grad student and I've only take an UG course in comp physics. Comp physics is about using the computer to solve physics problems that we can't do analytically. So you could think of it as applied computer science. CS is going to be more about the theory side, developing the tools that people use, or at least that's how it was at my institution. You have to ask yourself if you love physics, since there will be more doors open for the CS degree. I would suggest doing both majors if you want to pursue comp physics. 
Depends on how much you want to do physics. 

CS majors in general are usually pretty underprepared for physics, though they can contribute to scientific computation projects in an engineering role.
If the bubble universes formed from eternal inflation then their separation would be increasing so fast that they could never, even theoretically, run into one another. If however we are talking about other universes embedded in a stable extra-dimensional manifold like that envisioned for the Randall-Sundrum Graviton then collisions could take place. I believe that they are looking for patterns in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background. Calculations of this sort are highly speculative of course, but I'm sure that there are people working on it. If you like speculation in this area I suggest that you read Lisa Randall's book "Warped Passages". Some theories of the origin of the universe that attempt to go beyond the Big Bang Theory have hypothesized that the origin of our universe was caused by the collision of two Branes (each carrying a universe). The collision would impart energy to both universes allowing them to create matter and begin expanding. "No one really knows" is probably the correct answer, but I believe that these speculations are very important. There are way too many people that are way too eager to dismiss these concepts because they can't be falsified. Physicists and cosmologists are just too good at coming up with new ways of extracting more information than you ever thought possible from the data at hand.
To piggyback of the question. "What" does these bubbles float around in? When visualised we're using our 3D spacial dimensions, but wouldn't these bubbles float around in other dimensions not necessarily linked to the ones in the bubbles. 
I don't know the answer, but you're talking about [branes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane) and [brane cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology). The wiki links might provide some more info, and you can at learn search Google for the term brane cosmology.
From my understanding, the 'bubbles' are separated by GUT-matter (that is, dominated by a single super-force) that is continually in a state of inflation (that is, rapidly expanding far faster than the speed of light in the same way that our universe rapidly expanded during its first moments). This inflation of the GUT-matter continually creates new 'bubble' universes with randomized constants, but the distance between bubbles increases so rapidly that no communication between them (let alone collisions) is impossible.
Eh, the collision doesn't make syntactic sense to me. The "bubbles in an aquarium" model of the multiverse is really just a way of explaining it in a three dimensional manner.


It's really closer to infinite channels on a television set that are in no particular order, I guess. The channels shouldn't be able to overlap. Unsure of whether the concept of "leaving" one of the universes makes any sense.

Also, the universes are not developing in three dimensional space so the whole concept of overlap is shot down right out of the gate.

Did I already say that?

If they collided they'd have to occupy the same spatial dimensions? I guess as there's a lot of nothing in our universe there wouldn't be too many explosions. Another universe colliding with ours in our spacetime would be affected by dark energy and gravity, so I guess cosmological expansion would be another reason to minimise physic collisions. Maybe they'd pass through each other? Thought experiments are fun.
Wouldn't they be imbedded within with inflationary medium? Thus only moving further from each other? 

Or is your question only hypothetical? In that case, they wouldn't have different 'laws of physics' per say. (Level 4 multiverse) Only different constant values. They would likely simply merge, no?
First, this is philosophy, not science, because these ideas aren't subject to empirical observation or falsification.

Second, if two bubble universes merged, they would become one bubble universe, thus undermining the idea of multiple universes.

Most people who think about these things imagine the bubble universes floating in -- well, in space. But universes don't work that way, even in this philosophical speculation. Universes of space can't float in another higher space containing them without begging the question of what that higher space consists of. Maybe that higher space containing the bubbles is the real universe, and the bubbles are sort of like planets or galaxies at that level. If this rank speculation is accurate, then there's still just one universe.
I actually agree with this theory, scientists acknowledge that our universe is for some unknown reason moving very fast in a particular direction, the only plausible reason is that something with greater or equal mass exists outside of our universe and is causing chaos with gravity. 

Like most things that we don't quite yet understand, they dubbed this phenomena "dark flow".

Edit: stupid iPhone typo.

Pounds is a unit a force independent of where it is measured. A pound of force is the same whether it is on the Earth, the surface of the Moon or in the depths on interstellar space light years from anything. The *weight* of an object of a particular mass will be a different number of pounds depending on the local acceleration due to gravity.

And one other point:
> We say pounds of thrust instead of newtons to make it simpler

Untrue. "Pounds" (or more precisely "pounds-force") is used to measure thrust instead of "newtons" primarily in the United States not because it is "simpler" but because the US stubbornly refuses to convert to SI units used by 95% of the rest of the world's population. Both "pounds" and "newtons" are units of force.
The woman in the video is very confused. Presumably because of the mad usage of pounds as both a mass and a force (in fact, I think they're technically a unit of force/weight that people use as mass colloquially instead of the other way round).

A pound-force here is a pound-force anywhere in the universe. A pound-mass likewise. On other planets the conversion rate changes from ~1, which accounts for the confusion. Even on earth it's not exactly one-to-one as gravity changes locally (due to the shape of the earth and centrifugal effects).

The rocket *always* outputs 3000 pounds of force. But if the spacecraft *weighed* 3000 pounds on earth, it would weigh just 500 on the moon. Perhaps that is what she means - and in that case 1/6th as much thrust would be needed to lift the ship off the ground against the weaker gravity. In fact, given the same thrust and the same mass you'd get a larger acceleration on the moon due to the lower gravity.
EDIT: Like many, this post proves the existence of the *Reddit Effect*, to wit: the most reliable way to be downvoted is to post uncontroversial facts.

> The engine had 3000 pounds of thrust, therefore around 13350 newtons of force. The fact that the moon's gravity is lower, doesn't affect the engine's thrust, therefore the thrust is still 13.3 kilo-newtons.

All true. Once having left the ground, the craft's engine produces some design thrust, which produces a force applied to the craft and its occupants. The rate at which the craft ascends from the surface results from that force minus the local gravitational "force"^[1] , so in a powerful gravitational field like that on earth, the craft doesn't ascend as quickly as it would on the moon, but the force experienced by the craft's occupants is governed only by the engine's thrust.

To see why, imagine that the craft is in free-fall until the engine starts its burn. If, when the engine begins to apply its thrust to the craft, the craft happens to be at 100,000 feet and *pointed toward the ground*. Will the occupants feel the engine's thrust -- will they feel an equal-but-opposite force according to [Newton's third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion)? Yes. In fact, regardless of which way the craft is pointed, starting the engine at design thrust will subject the occupants to an equal-but-opposite thrust equal to the engine's thrust, *regardless of the local gravitational field*.

In the environment of the moon, starting the engine may lift the craft from the surface against the gravitational force^[1] , but once the craft is in motion, the occupants will feel the same force regardless of the local gravitational field -- they will only feel the engine's thrust, because technically, they are in free-fall.

The craft's rate of ascent depends on the local gravitational field, but the force felt by the craft's occupants depends only on the engine's thrust.

> Add to that, the alien environment of the moon. The moon only has about one sixth the amount of gravity that we have on Earth. So 3000 pounds of thrust coming out of that engine will actually feel like less on the moon...

Quite wrong.


1: In this example I'll engage in the polite fiction that gravitation is a force.
Lbf is a unit of force, lbm is a unit of mass. Both are independent of where they are measured. However, something with a mass of 1lbm weighs 1lbf on earth. 
This is a little random and not a well-posed question, but here goes. I have a BS in physics (I'm many years out of school now, switched to a non-physics field). I remember during undergrad learning stuff at a more technical level that I had read about in pop-science books and being kinda pissed at how misleading the pop-science was. I mean some stuff is almost lies! But of course getting a formal education taught me the "truth".

I was chatting with a physics post-doc the other day and he said he had the same experience in undergrad, grad school, and sometimes during his post-doc. Like "everything I knew before was just dumbed down BS". I didn't get a chance to get details, but this piqued my curiosity.

Have other people had that experience? Can you give a specific concept that this applied to? He was a particle physicist so maybe something in that area.
Is there any way to visualise what it would look like if outside of my house was suddenly rendered in a higher dimension? (for example) How would travelling along said dimension alter the view? 

Sorry if this is more mathematics than physics, but the lines of both seem to blur at many points.
I don't know exactly how to word this but here goes. I'll just ramble and feel free to touch on what you may be able to. 
I do not understand *time*. There are a few things:

1. Is 'the present' just a human construct? In my view of the world there is only really the future and the past. If the present truly exists how long does it last for? And if there is a certain amount of time the present exists for, can't it further be subdivided into past and future slices, thus eliminating an actual present?

2. Can we really speak about anything that "could have" happened? Does this even make sense from a physics standpoint? I am sitting here typing this right now, and I can think of other things I might have done at this time, but when it comes down to it, what is the point? What happened happened, and that will always be what happened. So in this context....

3. Do all events exist at once? And instead of time actually passing, we just experience time passing for some reason? Like the film on a movie reel analogy; there is thousands of individual pictures that exist all at once on a movie reel, but we experience them as a moving picture of time when played through a projector.

4. Finally, is the passage of time received differently for different beings, and is there any reason to believe time can be perceived differently for different beings. 


Thank you for any help you may offer.
Could an Alcubierre drive be used to escape the event horizon of a black hole?
I recently had a conversation with someone where we discussed wormholes, and he pointed out to me that wormholes as we currently think of them would violate either causality or relativity, because if you put one end near a strong gravitational field, they would either experience time at different rates, allowing you to travel back in time by going through the wormhole, or there would have to be some "universal" time that allows the wormhole to stay synced despite the time change, which goes against relativity.

Is this true? If so, do physicists believe that there is something missing that could reconcile this problem, or are wormholes impossible?
I think I've read that entanglement with the rest of the world causes the phenomenon (or appearance) of wave function collapse.  I know that you can do the double slit experiment with electrons, but since they are charged, in theory, the different electron paths would have different effects on nearby charges.  Why doesn't this cause collapse?  Even photons have mass, and thus a slight gravitational pull. Is this matter clarified in QFT?  Thanks.
For anyone in the field of Quantum Information Theory / Q Shannon Theory, could you recommend any possible ideas for a Bachelor thesis? My lecturer specialises in strong converse bounds, but because we want to have a final "result" at the end of the year, we both feel that tackling the problem directly would be far too much for an undergrad. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Quick question; does anyone know of any experiment that shows evidence that gravity is related to the speed of movement of a particle through space relative to another particle?

Example: a space probe sent into interstellar space breaks into three parts for an experiment. One sending(dense metal bar at high speed) one measuring device( to measure gravity waves as object passes) and one more sending device at the other end(to send an identical dense metal bar but pass at much slower speed).

The idea is that in an area of space with less gravitational influence, we would be able to measure small gravitational forces using a tiny laser light and measuring the bend of the beam as the dense bar zooms past in close proximity. The experiment would then be repeated but at a much slower speed to compare and gather data that may or may not show a correlation between the massive objects speed through space and it's gravitational pull. The sensitive experiment doesn't seem possible on earth or in orbit around earth because there is strong gravitational interference from all objects within the solar system. . . . 

Anyone aware of a theory or experiment that tries to tie speed of movement through space to gravitational strength?


I don't know if this is the right placer for this question, but how soon should i start to think about which specific field of physics I want to go into? Freshman year, Grad school, etc?
Hey, so my question is more of a personal one.

Sparing you the details, I used to be very good at math when I was younger, (learning high school algebra and geometry in middle school), but as time progresses past that point, I somehow found myself being absolutely garbage at math. Now, granted, I never really applied my efforts into that as I wanted to study music, but now, being freshly graduated from highschool, I find myself really wanted to study theoretical physics, because I was very much interested in the field as a child/early teen, but I fear I may be too far gone to catch up. For reference I ended up taking algebra I 3 times, II twice, and stat once all with D's and C's.

Sorry if this has been asked a thousand times before, and thanks in advance for the answers
What kind of equipment do  need to test specific theories of quantum gravity? How big and expensive would it be?
Under what circumstances does polygamous entanglement happen? Is entanglement normally only between two particles? What about Bose-Einstein condensates? Could the entire universe have been entangled as a result of the Big Bang?
Hi guys, I have a question about time dilation and the speed of photons.


Let's say there is a stream of photons coming *towards* me, approaching closer and closer. I am also speeding *towards* the incoming photons. 

Won't time dilation actually make the photons *accelerate*, since they are covering even more distance in less time?
































 I am a physics undergrad currently, taking my first semester of Electricity and Magnetism, but did really poorly in Physics 2 where most of the EMag stuff was introduced. I was hoping to get a good textbook suggestion that I can study on the side to keep up with the EMag class that doesn't assume I'm familiar with the material. Any help at all, be it a textbook suggestion or advice, is appreciated!
There isn't a best science degree. You should think about what things you're looking for in a degree. Do you want to have financial security? Maybe you don't care even the slightest bit about money and you just want to do research. How hard are you planning on studying for it? Different degrees have different study methodologies and different difficulties. 
I study physics because I love it and I love doing it for the sake of it. I can't imagine myself working in the private sector and I want to do the greatest possible research I can. I am prepared to study as much as necessary even sacrificing other things in my life. I think you should try to answer those questions and then see what fits you better. Sciences are really different between each other. One more thing is to picture yourself in the future with any of these degrees, which vision satisfies you more? For me this was the Deciding factor between physics and engineering. Good luck
Best science degree for job security is an engineering degree :p

I work with a good few physics majors in aerospace, but they're more like jobs which require someone capable of understanding science than true "science" jobs. 
Computer science...
But in all seriousness PM me if you have any q's.

I am currently a Phd student in physics and know quite a few people who recently defended and are moving elsewhere for jobs/post docs. Also know quite a few people from undergrad who went straight to work and can tell you how they did it.
Seriously pick the subject you love to do most. A with any degree in science in en 'engineering area' there will always be work. Unless you agree on that 'Humans need not apply' video on youtube.
http://www.collegechoice.net/50-highest-paying-careers-college-graduates/ might help from a salary standpoint.  Most sciences need a PhD to actually do science, though there are exceptions.
This also really depends on where you are in the world. I am in Germany and I know quite a few people with PhDs or MSc. degrees in Physics who ended up either getting a PhD in the industry or just working there in R&D. A lot of German tech companies employ Physics PhDs and there are also consulting firms, which specifically target the scientific sector.

Also keep in mind that different Phyics sectors will not be equally relevant to current technological developments.

I will be moving to the Netherlands to get my Physics PhD there, but mostly because I want to do exciting research. The excitement I get from this is really my main motivation, as long as I know that I don't have to worry about money.

There are many other qualifications you can have (e.g. programming skills) which aren't necessarily included in an academic degree, which might qualify you for more positions that aren't directly Physics related. I hope this helps you out a bit. If not, feel free to ask.
The Nth degree.
Within each science, there are many subfields, and in practice certain subfields are hard to assign to one field in particular. Mesoscopic Physics is very close to Electronics Engineering, Optics and Photonics are simultaneously branches of physics and EE, many fields of Materials Science, Chemistry, and (Condensed Matter) Physics have a large intersection, and also touch EE in certain areas (e.g. applied magnetism). Theoretical Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science overlap. And then there is the whole field of Medical Physics and Engineering where EE and Physical Chemistry touch at MRI, while Nuclear and Particle Physics is relevant for PET...

It is not at all uncommon for trained physicists to end up working in Materials Science, Chemistry, or Electrical Engineering, even within academia, or for chemists to work in physics.
Just go for whatever you feel like. I can only speak of academia from personal experience, but there are many subfields where different disciplines like Chemistry, Physics, Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, Medical Engineering, all come together.

Especially Materials Science seems like a random mixture of Solid State Physics, Solid State Chemistry, and some Engineering all thrown in one (funding) pot.
Pick something you are interested the most in. The absolute worst thing I can think of is hating the subject i'm trying to get a PhD in. I originally wanted to be a doctor specifically for money and financial security but I realized that wouldn't make me happy and I actually just really fucking love physics and now i'm working on my undergrad in physics and I couldn't be happier. 
Engineering. I have my BS in Physics and my Masters in Mechanical Engineering, it was a great choice. The strong fundamentals from Physics actually gave me an edge in my engineering studies and now I work R&D in engineering. The best advice I can give though is to mix in an engineering internship with some research experience while you can, a good combination of experience is really helpful.
Are you just starting college? 
Its been 5 hours can someone explain a bit for the lazy laymen? 
What does this mean for the diffraction limit in optical microscopy?
Dear All, thanks for your interest in our work. In simple terms, we discovered new optical methods that can measure the separation between two stars (or two fluorescent particles, the principle is the same) much more accurately than previously realized.

It is indeed well known in modern imaging research that Rayleigh's criterion is heuristic, diffraction is only half of the problem, and noise plays an equally important role in determining the accuracy of any image processing method. For the imaging of stars or fluorescent particles, the photon shot noise, due to the random arrival of photons on your camera detector, has become the major noise source in current technology. Previous research, such as http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0508047103, shows that the combination of diffraction and shot noise makes it difficult to estimate the distance between two stars accurately, and the estimation error just skyrockets when Rayleigh's criterion is violated. Our work, on the other hand, shows that cleverer optical techniques can avoid this skyrocketing error and achieve a much higher accuracy.

Indeed our techniques are related to the superresolution fluorescent microscopy that won the Chemistry Nobel Prize in 2014, but those methods require a way to turn the fluorescence of a subset of particles on and off to avoid violating Rayleigh's criterion and the skyrocketing error that I mentioned earlier. Our techniques, on the other hand, work purely on the far optical field and can be applied not only to close fluorescent particles but also to stars.

I can't emphasize enough the importance of taking photon shot noise into account. If you read Eric Betzig's original proposal in 1994 for example, he already recognized that photon shot noise is an important factor, and the use of proper statistics is arguably why his method works and won him the Nobel Prize.

Yes you need to know the centroid of the two sources quite accurately to align our proposed devices, but it is well known that the centroid is a lot easier to measure via direct imaging than the separation, so you just need to split some of the photons for centroid measurement first, before aligning our device. Our paper has a more careful analysis of that in an appendix.

An intuitive reason for why quantum information theory is relevant is because we need a rigorous formalism to deal with both the wave nature of light (diffraction) and the particle nature (photon shot noise), and to study how this combination affects our estimation accuracy.

To understand how our proposals work, the paper by Steinberg's group is indeed well written and a good reference. For more accessible summaries, please see http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2016/08/resolving-starlight-with-quantum.html and http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/sep/02/tapping-into-lights-hidden-information-to-push-fundamental-diffraction-limit.

If you are a scientist and have a more technical question, it is most likely answered on the FAQ we maintain at https://sites.google.com/site/mankeitsang/news/rayleigh/faq. Or just read the paper, which is open access and available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.031033. We are working hard to generalize our theory beyond two sources for more general imaging applications, but most likely it won't be relevant to 3D displays unfortunately.
this page could sure benefit from some love

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_metrology
Wow. That was an excellent article. The author really conveys his sense of excitement well and is entertaining to boot.
I'm very ignorant on the subject but does this have any application to 3d displays? 
I have a question about radioastronomy.  Is it possible that current radioastronomy techniques also "throw away information"?  My understanding is that radioastronomy currently involves computing either correlations in the electric field at different points, or correlations in the electric field squared (intensity interferometry).  I believe these are called respectively 2 and 4 point functions in quantum field theory.  But in principle we could use more of the statistics distribution of the electric field at N points, than just compute these correlations.
This would seem to require that we know the line of centers of the objects in advance.  Is this true?  If so, how can we find that line when we have not yet resolved the stars?
Problem with living in such environment has more to do with chemistry going on in human bodies than it has to do with physics.

Only physical restriction would be increased density of breathing gas which makes breathing more difficult.

At high pressure, gases we breath do slightly different things to our bodies. Oxygen becomes toxic, nitrogen causes narcosis and nearly every other gas has similar effect. Exception is helium and that's why it is used in scuba diving. 

Also, with increased pressure solubility of gases in liquids increase so when ascending diver must be careful because sudden change of pressure can cause dissolved gas to evaporate and form bubbles all over the body. That is called decompression sickness and it is dangerous because bubbles can block blood flow to different parts of the body and weaken bone structure if they are formed inside bones.

You get the idea. Problem with high pressure is in biological processes which are pressure dependent. 
You don't need to be strong and durable unless you're trying to keep the pressure out. If your body is at the same pressure it does not exert any force, in much the same way you do not feel 14.7 PSI bearing down on you right now.
As "strong and durable" as these:

http://diply.com/different-solutions/11-bizarre-creatures-found-in-mariana-trench-after-seeing/31086
changes in pressure effect chemistry, and therefore biology. the cell membranes of organisms that live at depth are different, because membranes from creatures at the surface are no longer fluid, and become waxy with high pressure
> the trench is 10,994 meters below sea level

To a very good approximation, the pressure goes up by 1 bar for every 10 meters. This means that the pressure you're looking at is 1100 bar. The human body is mostly made of incompressible materials, like water and bone. The little pockets of air that are compressible will equilibrate with the outside pressure if you regularely swallow, so from that point of view, you're good. You're not going to get crushed like a can of soda because unlike the can your insides will be at the same pressure as the outside world.

However, there are a few parts of the human body that don't deal with pressure so well, and the most important one is the nervous system. As you increase the pressure, different gasses start to interact weirdly with the nervous system. 

First you get nitrogen narcosis, basically the nitrogen in the air making you drunk. Then oxygen becomes toxic. These two problems can be staved off by using a breathing mixture with very low amounts of oxygen and no nitrogen, like Heliox (helium + oxygen). 

However, as you start crossing the 15 bar line (150 meters), even helium starts to cause problems via the poorly understood [high pressure nervous syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pressure_nervous_syndrome). You'll get tunnel vision, tremmors, nausea and you lose coordinations. Your ability to think straight is affected as well. 

This process can be staved off for some time by replacing most of the helium in your breathing gas with something else. Nitrogen is sometimes used, but that leads to nitrogen narcosis as seen above. An alternative is to replace some of the helium with hydrogen, forming [Hydreliox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydreliox). Using hydreliox with about 50% hydrogen staves off the point at which high pressure nervous syndrome occures, bringing it down to 50 bars (500 meters) and tests indicate that it's effects are not too severe even at 70 bars (700 meters). However, at that point, [hydrogen starts to make you drunk as well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_narcosis) so it is highly unlikely that humans are able to operate at pressures exceeding 100 bar. Note that this is still a factor of 10 off from the pressure at the bottom of the Marianas trench.
this is for /r/Biology more then physics.

Anyway from the physics point of view we are talking about 1000kg per cm square of pressure.

Roughly a ton per cm on your body, no need to say you might feel a bit squashy.

Tat's why most of the animals at such depth have little but sturdy bones, or are completely made of bones or boneless. Somehow it's about bones. mah....
Well given that under normal conditions the base PSI at sea level is 14.7. then after every foot, you add .443 psi you get this.

14.7+8342400(feet deep)*.443=3695689.7121 PSI.

so to answer your question you would need tom be made off something that could withstand that pressure.

They talked about this guy at statphys along with a whole lot of other scientist related human rights abuses. Until that presentation I never really thought about this kind of thing. Of course I knew scientists were sometimes coerced into doing things they don't want to do, but I never heard of an actual example.

Glad to hear it worked out for the guy.

Ciao Marco! 
I'm currently an undergrad at university of Pisa! Nice to see someone from our uni here! Of course you're my senior so I can't really give you much advice but if you're going for private sector and not academia, complex systems seems like a better choice. Would you be staying at Unipi for Msc? 
I studied physics a long time ago. Now I design, build and market iOS apps. IMO. Any study only tells you possible employer that you have the brain to take on an education like that. 
At least for the first example you linked, I know https://github.com/QuantumUtils/quantum-utils-mathematica supports symbolic commutators, and a small amount of simplification. It's more designed for Quantum Info calculations rather than matrices in general though.
Have you tried Maple?
I can't say that this functionality exists within it, but [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) is a very complex and powerful symbolic math environment that may have this ability. It will be up to you to examine its capabilities.

Another resource is [sympy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), a Python symbolics library, but again, I don't know if it has this specific ability. A literature search would be needed to find out.

It should simplify just fine if you specify the characters as being real valued. 
Because it is not a gauge field.

Fred Hoyle wrote a lot of [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle#Science_fiction)
some of us don't think kaku or brian greene write books about physics...
I wanted to find out how the world worked. This initially made me want to pursue an education in philosophy, but then I realized philosophy very quickly hits limitations and doesn't really set out to concretely prove anything in the way physics does.
Took physics as a cruise-class in high school, then I caught the addiction for the high you get from solving problems that other people have trouble solving. 
Basically, cosmological questions about the origin and evolution of the universe, theoretical physics issues about the nature of matter and forces, along with an appreciation for math.  Also, interest in reading about the historical giants in the field of physics.  *Scientific American* articles sparked a lot of interest as did Alan Guth's book *The Inflationary Universe*  and Stephen Hawking's early work on black holes. The puzzlement of quantum mechanics. Philosophical issues (e.g., ontology). I also remember a professor urging us to read about the principles and foundations of thermodynamics, what beauty there is in that field.
I had really good chemistry and maths teachers in school so I knew I was going to end up in science. I took both physics and chem classes in my first couple of years of college and decided I preferred physics so stuck with it.
In school, I had a terrible physics teacher during the final years. She was so bad that I had to dig into the books to learn physics. I realised how beautifully physics wove maths to the natural world. Up until then, I was had multiple choices, but she inadvertently made me focus on physics. Now I'm an undergrad. Thanks to her.
At the start of high school my science teacher could answer any questions i had with reasoning that added up.  I went to a religious school so alot of questions were answered with a correction of what i should be asking or answers with no evidence but the science answers were always legit.  Fast forward a few years and looking at the night sky pondering reality i decided i wanted to try understand the workings of the world. As with many questions if you keep asking 'why' you will get to physics and end up with a 'we dont know' answer.  I'm really keen to discover the ins and outs of why we don't know some things.
why did i get involved?

because reality is so intrinsically absurd that the only consolation for utter madness is surely convincing yourself you understand at least some of it.

also because stars are really pretty :)
I'm going to, um, second /u/Second_Foundationeer

> I caught the addiction for the high you get from solving problems that other people have trouble solving.

I'd enjoyed recreational mathematics since I was a kid. Which makes *pure* math feel sterile and boring. Physics was a sweet oasis of puzzles. Honestly, though, I was never married to physics, it was more "this is a neat gig; I'll just keep this up until they kick me out" and I just haven't gotten kicked out yet.
I figuring out how things work and fixing them when they break. Physics is cool because it extends to not just hardware, but also the universe!
After enrolling in about 20 different bachelors at the same time, my mother said: "Honey, you suck at anything applied, go do the most theoretical thing you can find. Actually, go do physics because you can't seem to shut up about it". Et voila: I am now doing a master's in theoretical physics.

I agreed with her because although I found high school physics incredibly dull I had read a lot about relativity and quantum mechanics and that seemed so vague that it had to be fun, also I was good at math but doing only mathematics seemed far too boring (although now I realize that "higher" math is really interesting and I have taken quite a few additional math courses). 
Something along the lines of /u/Second_Foundationeer. Curiosity definitely played a part, but ego did as well. If you want to maximize the benefits of the awe and respect you get from people around due to your intelligence, you study physics (or math). I also think that this kind of motivation underlies the choices of physicists more than they would like to admit.
Similar to others, I didn't find much challenging in high school until I got an F- on my first physics test. It spurred me to really learn and I fell in love. About 12 years later here I am with a Ph.D. in the damn thing, all because it was really hard and I needed to do well in it. 
Computing the entropy of a small class of heterotic black holes. Modular forms everywhere... Turns out the approach I wanted to use might not work. I can extract the leading behavior from a saddle point, but I wanted to do something a little better.
I was going to post a picture of my The Quantum Theory of Fields by Weinberg, but I would be lying. 

For a week now I am trying to debug/improve a problem with my code, and by my own estimation I can improve by 40% the speed if I manage to fix this.

back on quantum information, right now quantum algorithms/computation, feels refreshing.

wanted to ask if there is a book or script covering all quantum algorithms in details? also some notes about the intuition would be nice on how to generate an algo for your own ...?! or is just thinking and trying a few things out?
This is cute from a physics point of view, but in real life, urban planners will tell you that streets with *slower* speed limits actually move *more* cars. A [typical chart is on page 10 of this report](http://www.vtpi.org/compstr.pdf). So in reality, speed limits do affect capacity, they just affect in the opposite way that you'd think.
TL;DR 3 second rule means 1 car every 3 seconds maximum no matter the speed limit
The principal assumption (3 second rule) is dead wrong for heavy traffic (in my experience it rapidly gets thrown out the window by most people).

That report linked to by /u/warpzero is quite interesting actually. It attributes slower streets carrying more traffic to the decreased distance/time needed between you and the car in front (braking is of course a linear deceleration).

So I guess you could model a bunch of different situations and see what happens...
For example
(1) As it is now, constant stopping time
(2) Drivers linearly increase their stopping time up to 3 second max.
(3) Drivers linearly increase their stopping time with no limit (yeah, like thats going to happen)
(4) Maybe you could find some data from real traffic and play with that.

Of course none of this takes into account the other dynamic you see on freeways which I feel is quite important in heavy traffic, which is the oscillating stop-stop motions you get where waves of movement seem to propagate down lines of cars...
Observation is analogous to Interaction. Any time a system needs to know some property of a particle (position, momentum, spin, etc.) to decide what it will do, it is as if the particle has been observed. 

No architect of quantum theory ever implied that humans or brains had any special role in observation. Observation was always understood in the technical context of "making a measurement".


This comes up regularly.  It's probably the oldest unresolved question in quantum mechanics.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem


In quantum theory, observation doesn't require a human, it only requires a sequence of events that can collapse a wave function. A needle swings, a pen moves on a piece of paper, something usually macroscopic. In [this discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics)), the role of a human observer is debated, but I think the controversy about a human observer in quantum observation has been resolved: no human required. I don't think there's much substance to the argument -- after all, if a human is required to observe quantum phenomena, then how did the universe evolve to the point at which humans became available to collapse wave functions?
I think in the context of your experiment it's the photon used to record which slit the electron went through. 
Feynman will give you a good idea: http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html

Read section 1-6 and the following (up to 2-2 if you're inclined).

This kind of intuitive explanation will never give you a completely satisfying answer however. It's impossible to really grasp QM without diving deep into the math.
An observation is a "large classical system that interacts with another". Or in other terms: a perturbing hamiltonian which causes the wavefunction to collapse. The collapse has been shown to happen due to thermal variations in the large system which tend to cancel out all other states but one. Note: quantum mechanics is all about states of a particle and a superposition is as if the particle is in more states at the same time (kind of). An "observation" i.e. interaction then causes all the extra states to go away and the particle can then only be in a single state-->wavefunction collapse.

So basically a table stays in the same place because it is continuously observing itself.
Conscious observation and physical interaction are only correlations to the collapse of a wave function. Both are required, but neither is causal. The cause is simply whether which way information exists in this universe or not. If which way info can be deduced somehow by the setup of the experiment, there will be no interference. If that information cannot be deduced, there will be interference.

edit: OP, is 1600x1600 the maximum your software (the paid version) can handle? I would love to do some 1920x1080 stuff. (not dickbutt, I promise)
All you need is a gold foil, an alpha source, a vacuum chamber, a collimator, and a detector for the scattered alphas. Legal, but it might be expensive.
> I am interested in Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment and am wondering it it's legal (and safe) to recreate it in the US.

Small amounts of radioactive material are commonplace and quite safe if handled carefully. For example, smoke detectors each have a small amount of Americium 241, and these things are everywhere.

As to gold foil, not much is required to support such an experiment, and it doesn't need to be very thick, in fact, in some ways, because of the nature of the experiment, the thinner the better. Reference: [Gold leaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_leaf).

So in principle and with patience, one could reproduce the Rutherford experiment on a small budget. In practical terms, using a smoke detector Americium source, it would be a matter of being willing to wait for enough events to construct a meaningful statistical result.
A couple things:

1. When a poster just drops a paper into /r/physics, and it's not a recent one, we ask that you say something about why you're posting it.  Do you have a specific question?  Do you think this paper is great/terrible?  What should we look for?  Why are you sharing it with us?

2. "Quantum fields are not fields." Comment on "There are no particles, there are only fields." http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6384 EDIT: [same but with Hobson's reply (pdf)]( http://physics.uark.edu/hobson/pubs/13.09.a.AJP.pdf), thanks /u/A_R_K.
I'd just like to point out that if anyone is interested in discussion around Art Hobson's paper that this post links to, there are two existing archived /r/physics posts with a total of 51 comments at

https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1s036p/there_are_no_particles_there_are_only_fields/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1s43sa/there_are_no_particles_only_fields/

Also, there is this at stackexchange which gets into more technical details such as second quantization: 

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/122570/which-is-more-fundamental-fields-or-particles

And this: https://www.quora.com/Whats-your-take-on-the-no-particle-all-field-interpretation-of-quantum-field-theory

These might serve as background if anyone wants to get into further discussion.

I have no comments on Hobson's paper, other than to say that the physics professors I most respect and follow quite clearly state that it's fields that are fundamental, not particles.  Questions like this can quickly descend into philosphical issues of ontological realism etc, but at least from a  physics theory (QFT) and math viewpoint, it seems there is a plurality of agreement on the fields side, isn't there?, though of course some have different (e.g., pilot wave theory^1 ) or perhaps even more leading-edge thoughts.

Photosyntesis as a choice course, the book is Molecular Mechanics of Photosyntesis by Blankenship. It just sounded very cool.
I suppose I'm not *taking* any interesting physics classes, since I'm in high school, but I'm rather excited about finishing the last few chapters on special relativity in Morin's mechanics, so that I can begin working on Purcell's Electricity and Magnetism.
To be honest, I'm having quite a hard time on a lot of the problems, but I believe (read as: *really bloody hope*) that's to be expected. 

Besides the self study, my high school classes include maths, physics, English, history, biotechnology, German, Danish, and the very dreaded, but obligatory, PE.
Thanks for asking. I'm taking advanced quantum mechanics and measure theory, I'm excited about the quantum and terrified of measure theory. 

The quantum class is (I think) the second half of Griffiths, and the measure theory is following "Measure, Integral, and Probability" by Capinski and Kopp

And then I have a bunch of requirement classes (history, philosophy...) which I've been pushing off for too long and need to get out of the way if I want to graduate. 
Advanced quantum field theory, master's course on astronomy and the rest I still haven't decided. I was thinking about hearing some pure math lectures to strengthen my "ground game"
I'm taking an 'easy year' and doing a lot of computer science courses and some extra physics. Taking a break from the usual astrophysics path just to add to my capabilities. I have to take an arts elective and its Russian. I'm most excited about the Russian. It'll be my 4th language! 
I'll be taking Physics of the cell, classical geometry, and an introduction to statistics and probability course. Along side this i'll be doing literature research on in vitro single molecule biophysics, and completing another undergraduate research project in either optics or biophysics.
Doing a course called Microsystems Technology & Applications. Lots of stuff about material properties, MEMS and NEMS, biosensors, and interfacing with microsystems. I don't need the credits anymore, but it looks interesting. Teaching 2nd year labs as well.
Quantum mechanics (2nd half of Griffiths) and a basic semiconductor lab which is a massive time sink. 
Going into my fourth (MPhys) year of my undergrad degree:

First semester:

1. General Relativity

  Taking this because it has been my "dream" since I was a young child

2. Inference from Scientific Data

  Non-exam, sounds interesting and to be honest something that I really *should* know.

3. Superconductivity

4. Quantum Mechanics 4 (Relativistic quantum mechanics)

  Scared about this, the lecturer is a very crazy guy from the theoretical physics department

Second Semester:

1. Quantum Field Theory

2. Condensed Matter Physics (+ some phase transitions since I'm a 4th year, so we have to do more)

  For this I'll use Oxford Solid State Basics. Also scared about the amount of work here.

3. Quantum Optics

  This sounded interesting, I had a look and the notes looked really great (LaTeX'd, great sense of humour) and the content looked really great. Also the lecturer is my year 4 project supervisor.
Started a engineering physics program. 
36 hours, a full course load at my university, of thesis research. I am most excited about finishing my PhD sometime soon, and moving past grad school. I am dreading finishing my PhD sometime soon, and moving past grad school :P. 
Maths methods 1, Classical Mechanics, intro to modern physics and physics in practice (basically the electronics and stats you need to know before going in a lab). First semester ever, looking forward to it!
Statistical mechanics, differential topology, intro to general relativity and quantum field theory.
Two seminars, one on topological states of matter and the other on string cosmology. Sounds fun!
Classical Mechanics I (Out of Taylor)

Quantum Mechanics II (Second Half of Griffiths)

Quantum Mechanics Lab (I think we're using Melissinos)

Abstract Algebra I (Using Farleigh)



Modern Physics, statics, approximations of ODE's, Matlab programming, math methods and a communications class. Statics so far has been the easiest and my ODE class has been the hardest. This is weird cuz I despise statics yet love ODE (aced ODE 1)
General relativy (my young self dream) and quantum optics
First year of college, looking to double major physics and political science. 

I'm in physics 168 which is analytical, but do already have credit for it (I'm taking it to get to know the Prof). 

Earlier today (only the second Tuesday I've had on campus), however, one of the physics profs approached me and asked about student research and if I'd be interested... 

I think I made a good impression... 
GR, solid state theory and QFT.
Circuit analysis :(

Solid state physics, statistical mechanics/thermodynamics and computational physics. In Germany the lectures usually don't follow a specific text book, students are expected to choose the one they're most comfortable with. 
Depending on the geometry there could be significant horizontal forces too. We can't tell you unless you provide a diagram of what you're doing or at least some pictures and details. 
Well the net force must clearly be zero for the object to remain static.
A wall-mounted L-bracket with two mounting bolts on the wall and a point for load attachment at the farthest horizontal extent is relatively easy to analyze. Assuming the lower of the two mounting bolts is the pivot point and the upper get pivoted by the load, the upper bolt will experience a reasonable percentage of the load's weight.

Some of the load's weight will be shared between the top and bottom bolts with a vertical vector, and some will be expressed as a rotation around the pivot point and pull horizontally on the upper bolt. The exact details will depend on the shape of the L-bracket, the dimensions of the mounting hardware, and the thickness and flexibility of the sheetrock/plaster.

Need I add that you would be better off using a stud finder and anchoring the bracket in a wall member instead of depending on the strength of the sheetrock/plaster. It's been many years since I relied on simple plaster to bear loads instead of locating a beam and sinking more substantial hardware into wood.

As it happens, I just sank a hook into a beam in the roof of my largest room, so I can test technical climbing rigs without having to climb a tree in my yard. The hook can easily bear my weight (82 kilograms / 180 pounds) as I test single-line ascent rigs:

http://i.imgur.com/N02Ltva.jpg

Believe me when I tell you -- I wouldn't trust plaster for this.

Newton. sure, some of his discoveries were also in the works by other people (or had been made before and he re-discovered), and some of them have been surpassed by newer theories, but pound for pound the number of things Issac Newton developed concrete, mathematical relations for of our surrounding world, there is no equal. Considering the time period he lived in, his unique position in it, and the way things are now, there probably will never be another person like Newton. 
I often like to mention one of my personal heroes, [Emmy Noether](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether), described by Einstein and others as "the most important woman in the history of mathematics."  Among some of her accomplishments:

* [Noether's (first) theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem), which is a cornerstone of modern physics and relates differentiable symmetries of the physical action to conserved quantities.  As I understand it, this development was a consequence of her working to solve a problem in general relativity that Einstein couldn't figure out (whether/how to conserve energy in GR), and her solution not only gave us one of the best technical definitions for energy that we have, but was so generic it immediately applied to many other conserved quantities such as momentum.
* Various important contributions to fundamental aspects of abstract algebra, and relating it to other areas of mathematics that her contemporaries thought were largely unrelated.  I've heard it said that without her contributions here we might not have been able to develop field theory far enough to get the standard model of particle physics.
* She's known for her work being extremely generic and widely applicable, her approach to solving problems centering on eliminating all unnecessary dependencies and focusing on only the most essential assumptions and conditions.

What really makes her my hero though is that she did all of this despite being constantly affronted by both sexism and racism, all the while being extremely humble and measured in her conduct.  She was born into a Jewish family in Germany, and at the time women were not permitted to be professors, so after she graduated she was only allowed to lecture as an assistant to a professor.  Eventually however, with enough outcry from both the faculty and the student body, she was allowed to have the title of professor but was still not paid for it.  After more teaching and accomplishment, finally she was given pay, but still denied tenure!  Eventually after all of her outstanding efforts they finally allowed her to have tenure, but then shortly afterwards the Nazi party came into power and, seeing how she was both a woman and a Jew, fired her and many of her associates, prompting outrage and a near riot by her fellow professors and her loyal student following, many of whom threatened to abandon their education unless she was allowed to teach.  But in the midst of the turmoil, she didn't bat an eye, and insisted that her students not be deterred and that they finish their degrees, and not be discouraged or incited to violence.  She continued to teach many of them after hours and outside the university's curriculum.  Eventually as the political arena reached a fever's pitch, she emigrated to the US, and there is a memorial dedicated to her in my very own home state of Pennsylvania, which I plan to visit someday before I die, haha.

Anyway, I hold her as a source of inspiration not only because of her mathematical brilliance but the combination with her great humility and perseverance against the bigotries of her time.  The way I see it she had all of the qualities befitting a hero, but was a real actual person and not just a comic book character.  She might be arguably rivalled in mathematics by the likes of, say, Euler, Gauss, Einstein, Newton, and others, but I feel that her character extends beyond just her accomplishments and really makes her stand out among them.
Lev Landau. Our universe is full of smaller universes; Landau taught us to understand those, and those universes in turn taught us much about the big one.
Faraday introduced the concept of fields, and the next century saw a revolution in physics that eventually interpreted all particles and forces in these terms. Everything you've ever seen or touched is a particular distribution of energy in fields.

It takes effort more than pure intelligence. Any skills you lack you can learn. Intelligence is fluid.
Just to study and learn physics seriously, it's never too late. Do it if you want to know physics.

It doesn't take a genius to learn physics. All it takes is a lot of dedication and a driving passion, and with those I believe literally anyone can learn physics.
> I'm 27 years old, college dropout, not especially intelligent. Is it too late to get into school for physics? 

That depends on what you want to do with the acquired knowledge. There are plenty of physics applications that aren't earth-shaking breakthroughs, and that are constructive and interesting professions.

Not everyone who learns physics is going to be a college professor or world-renowned theoretician. Some design bridges and airplanes -- examples of applied physics, which in truth probably constitutes 80% of the field.
The wonderful thing about the human brain is its plasticity. If you're willing and determined enough to learn, you should be fine.

Have you watched the videos about measuring refractive index on youtube.  That might be much better than a text explanation.


> Does the cell that holds the water not impact the RI?

Yes, it does, because the RI of glass is roughly 1.5, but for water it's 1.33. But this effect isn't usually important -- here's an example:

http://i.imgur.com/Ui2iYXA.png

In the above image (created using [OpticalRayTracer](http://arachnoid.com/OpticalRayTracer)), the glass cell walls (with an RI of 1.5) are relatively thin compared to the water volume (with an RI of 1.33). So you can see that the overall refraction effect is dominated by the water, simply because there's more of it.

> Why does the cell need to be rectangular; could it be a beaker?

Here's why you would want to avoid a beaker (also generated using [OpticalRayTracer](http://arachnoid.com/OpticalRayTracer)):

http://i.imgur.com/CijOQqW.png

That looks like it would be very confusing to sort out a particular refractive index -- you're better off setting up with a rectilinear vessel.

> Does the distance of the laser pointer from the cell matter?

No. Some of your questions will answer themselves when you start experimenting.


> Does the depth of the water matter?

Not for the refraction (all of which happens at the transitions between media), but when you start taking measurements, knowing the dimensions of your vessel may help you make the required measurements.

Maybe it would be better for you to start by planning your experiment with my free program [OpticalRayTracer](http://arachnoid.com/OpticalRayTracer), and after you have some idea what the problems will be, you can start in the lab.
Superluminal message sent to ship:

x_0_ship = 5 days * c

v_ship = c / 2

x_0_message = 0

v_message = 2 * c

x_f = x_0 + v * t

x_f = 5 days * c + c / 2 * t = 0 + 2 * c * t

5 days = 3 * t / 2

t = 3.33 days

x_f = 5 days * c + 3.33 days * c / 2

x_f = 6.66 light-days 

The message will catch up when Discovery is 6.66 light days away using your classical approximation. There may be more mistakes but the rest is built on this, just go through the math carefully.
I'm starting my PhD soon and my topic involves theoretically studying what happens to the lining of nuclear fusion reactors. That is the biggest limiting process for sustainable nuclear fusion at the moment. The lining wears out extremely quickly so it has to be replaced often, i'm gonna study why and hopefully come up with a model that properly reproduces experimental observations. Maybe try to propose sturdier systems.

Feel free to ask any questions, but bear in mind i still haven't started.

Edit: just read the article in full. I'm proud to say I'll visit the reactor pictured. In fact, I'll probably work there a lot. It's gonna be awesome.
Curious what peoples stance is on General fusions method. It seems to make a lot of sense to me. Accounts for the neurons and gives a simple way to extract power.
Author makes note of one the big problems in fusion power research:   tokamaks like ITER must be huge and complicated, which is one of the reasons they must also be expensive. Going all-in on ITER means there's no money left to fund alternative, but ultimately more plausible approaches (or even other tokamaks) -- of which there are at least a small handful: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fusion_experiments

I'm excited about EAST, NIF, W7X, JET, EMC2, Tri Alpha, General Fusion.

My favorite dark horse here is Lawrenceville Plasma Physics' dense plasma focus stuff. 
The graph remains just silly, i mean, how could they look forward 40 years, and say, right, we'll need those wiggles in funding then. But it is just a small silly thing.

I do wonder if plasma is *actually* understood well enough so you can say "build so and so, it'll work!" Remember recently something new being understood about turbulence of electrons also mattering? We're in turbulence regime in parts of the plasma that is not entirely understood? I mean, if you can model things well in wide regimes you can say that it will work, and then i think that indeed, lots of money should be thrown at it. (and well managed)
That was a really good read! Thanks
I wonder how this compares with solar power? I know you guys are heavily invested in fusion, but how does an unbiased economical comparison of a near-best-case fusion vs solar go? I think a lot of people tend to forget that solar power is also "virtually free, unlimited energy" that you "only have to build the infrastructure". It's not cheaper than fossil fuels currently (it is in some places tho!), but it's well within an order of magnitude and holds great promise.

Some numbers from very rough googling: $2.50/W => 25 billion would actually give 10 GW of power. Much more than the provided estimate, using some *current low scale actual commercial data*. Imagine what we can do in a few years with massive utility-scale more advanced panels. Probably $1/W or less. If you care about the storage problem $3/W should have you covered with room to spare.

So I think fusion is only going to be required much further in our civilization tech tree, pretty much when most of Earth is covered in solar panels.

I mean, it's pretty hard to beat the economies of scale of a 10^30 kg fusion reactor we have over our heads. So I think the current funding is more than adequate and ITER a white elephant. Convince me otherwise if I'm wrong, please?
You are working on the cart while the horse has yet to be domesticated.
Nuclear Fusion (H to He) is the power of the future - was, is and will continue to be for a very long time to come.  Instead of hoping for something tomorrow we need to get on with implementation of wind turbines and solar panels on a massive global scale.  Plus super insulation of buildings and electric-motor based transportation.
Almost ready, another 15 years.

That looks pretty normal, though once you get into your upper division classes, you will take the same "name" as those classes but much more in depth.
So, does anyone have the lesson plans for a class like this? or the syllabus/ curriculum?
Currently in highschool but will take Physics 1 at a local community college. From the syllabus that I was given, your class looks similar to mine.
Hey, I have no knowledge of efimov states but just want to say that photons do interact with each other in qed via higher order Feynman diagrams. Depending on he energies of the photons this might be much larger than gravitational interactions 
In any reasonable experimental situation, photons don't interact. A setup in which temperature is high enough that photon-photon interactions are significant and simultaneously the system remains fully quantum is probably not possible or at least ridiculously hard.

Btw, the strongest contributor to photon-photon for most centre of mass energies is that coming from the box diagram in QED mediated by a virtual electron going in a loop, and that is really, really small if the energy is smaller than 2*m_e, and it doesn't grow very fast with energies above that.
The important thing that makes photons different from massive bosons (like, e.g., cold atoms used to observe efimov states) is that *photon number is not conserved*.

So, if you have a photon gas in equilibrium with nonzero number density, it also has a pretty high energy density. As you try to cool your photon gas down so that thermal fluctuations aren't destroying your (very small binding energy) efimov trimers, what's going to happen is the photons just go away. This is the same reason that one can't make an equilibrium BEC out of photons.
The "speed of light" in relativity has nothing to do with light specifically, it's a basic feature of space and time that there is a maximum speed that applies to *all* information. It just so happens that a massless particle like light must always travel at the maximum speed, and light was the first massless particle discovered (though we didn't think in those terms then)
PBS Spacetime has a great video series that provides a layman level understanding of the relationship between space and time and mass.

The [playlist here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPUh22kYmNCLrXgf8e6nC_xEzxdx4nmY) covers the 6 videos, which are all approximately 10 to 15 minutes.

Overall, Spacetime is a great series for interested non-physicists.
Hello adeebchowdhury. Not a silly question at all.

Your way to think of it does not reflect the law (lorentz transformation, or more precisely the velocity-addition formula) although it is a way to think of it that works. 

A more accurate way to think of it is this: Want to know at what speed does something move? Measure it. Want to know how much time does it take to something to happen? Measure it. The problem arises when you want to know at what speed is that thing moving from the point of view of that planet, or that star, or that rocket. That's what the law it's for: To know how things look from others point of view (reference system). What I want to point out with this is that there isn't A speed, there are just points of view, for we dont know which point of view is "the good one" (maybe cosmic background radiation, but that is not THE good one. Is just A VERY good one).

End of the story: we know the law to know how things move from others points of view. Turns out that the higher the speed of something is from your perspective, the less it will change its speed when you change the perspective, the extreme case being things that move at speed C which do not change their speed at all. In other words: If something is moving slowly to you, it may be moving really fast for another person moving fast relative to you. But if something is moving at a speed near the speed of light from your perspective, no matter at what speed the other observer is moving, he will see that same thing moving near the speed of light (Although the exact value may change little)

This effects happens to everything. It's just that massless particles (aka photons) travel at speed C always, whereas other bosons with mass can be found moving at different speeds. 

As for the final question: Special relativity consists of two postulates (things that we know that must be always true) and the rest of it is math developed to calculate things in order that this postulates ALWAYS hold. This two postulates are:

1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial systems (non-accelerating frames of reference).

2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.

So no, the forces in nature are the same for everybody (or that is what we think) and special relativity is a system to calculate things in order that that assertion is true. 

Hope that helps.
(I'm a physics degree student, 4th year)
Just a couple things to clarify that might aide your understanding:

>As an observer gains a higher velocity, the speed of light relative to the observer decreases. Thus, to maintain the constancy of the speed of light, the flow of time shortens for the observer. The length of a second increases so that light can cover the same distance in a second (relative to the observer) as it does relative to an observer at relative rest

The speed of light is constant for all observers, independent of relative velocity. As many others have pointed out, light is not special: any massless particle would travel at the same speed through vacuum. The speed of light is more accurately named the "speed of causality", or the maximum speed at which information can propagate through space. The assumption that observers measure the speed of light to be "c" in vacuum, regardless of velocity is in some sense equivalent to saying that causality must propagate with the same maximum speed (the laws of the universe must move forward in time with the same rate) regardless of relative velocity. Time does not slow itself down to make this axiom true, it is the other way around. Time dilation and length contraction are necessary byproducts of this assumption on our models of reality.

You should also be careful about how you describe the effects of length contraction and time dilation. These phenomena occur relative to an observer at rest.  All motion is relative. If I measure you moving with respect to me, then I will observe your clock ticking slower than mine does, and I will observe lengths in your direction of motion to be contracted. However, from your perspective, those things would be true for me, as I would be the one moving relative to *you*.

Also keep in mind that all of this (length contraction, time dilation, etc.) applies to relative motion at *constant* velocity. As soon as you step out of that framework and, say, start to incorporate acceleration or various forms of energy and radiation, you're in the realm of General Relativity, and possibly QCD and QFT. Nothing is as simple, but it's no less beautiful and mystifying.
It's not really that time slows down. Time isn't some fixed thing in the background in which everything is immersed. Time intervals are properties relating events in spacetime, and how long a time interval is depends on your frame of reference.

You can make an analogy to spatial coordinates. Say you're facing your computer, which is about a foot in front of you. If you turn 45 degrees to your left, your computer is no longer a foot in front of you: it's about 0.7 feet in front of you, and 0.7 feet to your right. The total distance from you to the computer is still one foot, but the way its displacement resolves into components has changed.

Events are characterized by where they occur in space, and when they occur in time. An LED light on your computer might blink at intervals of one second. If you're sitting still (relative to your computer), these blinks all occur at the same place in space. However, if you boost yourself to about 70% of the speed of light (relative to your computer), then these blinks all occur a distance of about 300,000,000 meters apart. Additionally, the blinks will occur (from your perspective) about 1.4 seconds apart.

This isn't because time has slowed down for your computer. Someone still sitting still (relative to your computer) would see things you do as dilated in time as well. Time dilation is a matter of perspective, how displacement in spacetime resolves into time differences and spatial displacements. It's not that there's some background process called time that speeds up or slows down.

Also, there are quantities that remain the same when you switch between reference frames. The speed of light is one of these.
So as others have mentioned, the cosmic speed limit has little to do with light and more to do with the fact that it's massless. *Any* massless particle with have the same properties. 

In fact the same thing *does* happen for other massless particles like gluons and gravitons. W/Z bosons do have mass and so they do not experience exactly the same thing. 

Also keep in mind that the person moving fast does not experience their time as ticking away slowly. Neither can they objectively check  that their time is ticking away slowly. To them all is well and the speed of light (the cosmic speed limit) is still the same. 

The discrepancy becomes apparent when a stationary observer tries to calculate how fast the clock of the moving person is ticking away. Or if the stationary observer tries to calculate distances as seen by the moving person. 

To answer your last question, no, the changing of the rate of clock ticks is not because of the effect that this has on the force carriers. The main way that you can see this is to consider two observers moving with respect to each other. In this case each observers would judge the force carriers of the other are moving more slowly. This clearly can't be true. 

The true reason for these spatio-temporal effects has to do with the way that the geometry of space and time is setup to respect a cosmic speed limit. It doesn't matter what is occupying the space or indeed if anything is occupying the space at all. Space and time still behave differently in different frames of reference. 

Frames of reference being states of motion in a straight line with constant speed. Each of these frames measures time and space elements along their direction of motion differently from other frames of reference. 

I hope this clarifies things :-)
> As an observer gains a higher velocity, the speed of light relative to the observer decreases.

No.  I get what you're trying to say from your next sentence -- "the speed of light WOULD decrease, but since it can't, the flow of time ..." but even so, this is an incorrect statement.  If light was not a constant speed, speeding up doesn't necessarily mean the speed of all photons would decrease relative to the traveler; for example, light travelling towards him would (theoretically) speed up.

> Thus, to maintain the constancy of the speed of light, the flow of time shortens for the observer. The length of a second increases so that light can cover the same distance in a second (relative to the observer) as it does relative to an observer at relative rest.

Actually time slows down for both the traveler and the observer.  The observer thinks the clock in the ship is running slow; the traveler in the ship thinks the clock on the observer's planet is running slow.  This gets rapidly "corrected" when either party accelerates or decelerates.

> The same thing does not occur for other bosons--gluons, W/Z bosons, gravitons, etc, does it? Does that mean that, unlike photons, the speed of these bosons actually does decrease relative to you?

All things experience time dilation; even photons.  The distinction is that inherently massless particles like photons can only move at the speed of light, so they experience infinite time dilation.  I think you may be asking, though, whether those other particles can "cause" time dilation like the photon does, which is misleading, because photons aren't the cause, either.  It's simply that particles that move at the speed of light always move at the speed of light, so they become a reference point for the time dilation effect.

> And since these bosons are the ones mediating the forces of nature and thus (I assume) the rate at which natural processes occur, does that mean that the reason time slows down as you speed up is because the speed of the forces of nature (apart from electromagnetism) decreases relative to you?

I don't think anyone can say "why" time slows down other than it's a consequence of our universal laws.  It is true that as time slows down, the rate of natural processes also slows down; that's nearly the definition of time slowing down in the first place.  But as for time dilation effecting natural forces, we can certainly see that experimentally; for example, muons that we generate in a lab move fairly slowly, whereas muons we see hit the Earth from space are generally moving at 98% or so the speed of light.  As a consequence, the "lifetime" of the muon before it decays is much longer for the fast-moving muons, which we can measure (to us, it looks like the muon's internal decay "clock" is running slowly).

>As an observer gains a higher velocity, the speed of light relative to the observer decreases. 

>As someone travels at a higher velocity, the speed of photons decreases relative to him.

Does it? The postulate of special relativity is that c is constant in all inertial reference frames. 

The speed of light is not a property of photons, it's the relationship between a second and a metre in this universe. Therefore anything which is massless will permeate the universe at 3x10^8 m every second.

So all the forces are mediated at c, and the speed of forces is not the source of spacetime distortion.

As others have said, time and space will appear normal in any single reference frame (again stated by the postulate). The distortions occur between reference frames, and generally speaking, all of the counter intuitive scenarios that are used to make special relativity seem crazy are all simply explained by acceleration. For example, I've seen it said that a car of length d travelling at 0.99c will not appear to be that length by a 'stationary' observer. Therefore you can park in a garage that is shorter than d. But there has to be a finite deceleration of the car to stop, and so the slow down as it enters the garage's inertial frame will result in both systems seeing the same car size.

You can think of special relativity fairly simply as a landscape in spacetime. You will have valley of spacetime that you can experience, namely your 'lightcone'. That concept is the best visualisation I think as it's not a bullshit analogy, google that.

You do hit on something that perhaps you didn't realise, or maybe it is the point of your confusion. The reason that light travels at difference speeds in different media is related to the interaction rate in the media. The reason objects are distorted by a lens, or just in water, is because the photons interact more often per unit length. The angle of the ray line you see is directly related to the speed of light in the medium (Snell's Law).

Off the top of my head, so I may be very wrong in some aspects. I'd usually avoid answering but this is how I came to simplify things when asking similar questions, so I hope it complements the more in-depth explanations you've had.
I'm not totally sure if you're still checking this thread, but it's worth a shot...

As others have pointed out, the speed of light is a constant (about 3 x 10 ^8 m/s) for all observers, including an observer traveling *close to* that speed.  That causes some pretty wacky things to arise, such as the length contractions and time dilations you mention.

One interesting thing to add is that [biological processes experience the time dilation, with some even crazier theoretical consequences](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9184743).  I know it doesn't directly address your question, but it may be something you'd be into!

> As an observer gains a higher velocity, the speed of light relative to the observer decreases. Thus, to maintain the constancy of the speed of light, the flow of time shortens for the observer. 

No. To an observer on a moving platform, the speed of light remains the same, and the subjective perception of time remains the same. It is only when one frame of reference compares its measurements to those observed on another frame that time seems to have different rates. And that perception has some interesting properties as well -- for two platforms A and B, moving past each other at high speed, both platforms see the other platform as having an observed time rate slower than its own.

But again, on the local platform, both the speed of light and subjective time passage seem normal.
> (Right?)

Alas, no.

The speed of light is the same for any observer regardless of their speed, but it's not because it's compensated by time dilation.  We can show that by thinking about what would happen to light going the other way.  According to your theory, time should slow down because of light going in the direction of your motion, but accelerate because of light going in the opposite direction.  How would that work?

What happens instead is something that seems very peculiar to us because we're not used to it: if you have an observer A on earth and an observer B on a moving spaceship, and if at a specific moment the ship emits photons forward and backwards, observer B will always see themselves in the middle of the two photons, as they are moving away from the ship at the same speed, while observer A will see the spaceship closer to the photon moving forward, as the ship is moving in the same direction.

This illustrates something not well known from the theory of relativity: speed can not only distort space and time, it can also change simultaneity!  Events that happen in a specific order to someone might happen simultaneously or even in reverse order to someone else.

In any case, your premise is flawed, and obviously the rest is going to be problematic:

> As someone travels at a higher velocity, the speed of photons decreases relative to him

Nope.  Photons always travel at the same speed to all observers.

> The same thing does not occur for other bosons--gluons, W/Z bosons, gravitons, etc, does it? Does that mean that, unlike photons, the speed of these bosons actually does decrease relative to you?

It's not just light: any massless particle always travels through a vacuum at the speed of light, which would include gluons and gravitons, if I'm not mistaken.  W and Z bosons have mass, which means they could travel at any speed lower than the speed of light, and it is theoretically possible to chase one and catch up with it.

> does that mean that the reason time slows down as you speed up is because the speed of the forces of nature (apart from electromagnetism) decreases relative to you?

Nopers.  As mentioned, this is not because of time dilation.

If we want to address time dilation briefly: the percieved time by any observer is always the same.  An hour always feels like an hour to you, no matter your speed.  It's always external objects that seem to have a slower time (as long as you're not accelerating).  Note that in their point of view, their time is perfectly normal and *your* time seems to go slower.  Because, you know, it's all relative.

One way to look at it is to say: everything goes through spacetime at the speed of light.  The faster you go through space, the slower you go through time.

Bernoulli's principle can be a bit counter-intuitive. It can help to think of pressure in terms of the kinetic energy of the individual molecules/atoms of the fluid in the pipe.

If a fluid is sitting in the pipe at some temperature (remember that temperature is just average kinetic energy of atoms) the atoms are whizzing around in random directions. We observe pressure as the net force of those atoms striking the inside of the pipe. Now, let's move that fluid along the pipe. Assuming constant temperature (think energy), if the kinetic energy in one direction (along the pipe) has increased, then the kinetic energy of random motion (think pressure) has to have decreased.
An increase in speed is caused by having high pressure on one side and low pressure on another side of a fluid packet, leading to a net force.  Therefore, as flow speeds up it must be travelling to a lower pressure region.
See it in terms of energy, work+potential energy+kinetic energy=constant. Now, work is force times displacement, potential energy is mass times g times height and kinetic energy is 1/2 mass times velocity squared, since the volume of water being displaced is constant then you can divide everything by the volume of water and it'll still be a constant, so you get bernoullis equation, force times displacement divided by volume becomes force divided by area (pressure), mass times g times height becomes density times g times height and 1/2 mass times velocity squared becomes 1/2 density times velocity squared, so now that you have that and the equation of continuity it follows that if you increase velocity and keep height the same then pressure must drop so that energy is conserved. 
There are several examples of macroscopic quantum phenomena. Probably the most well-known "macroscopic quantum phenomenon" is superconductivity. Here's a [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6AAhTw7RA).  Some other examples include [superfluidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity), and the [tunneling microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope), which could not work without quantum effects. If we were to run the universe back to some point and start it over, it would be exceedingly unlikely that we would end up in the state we are currently in.
Random quantum fluctuations in the first moments of the big bang determined where galaxies and galaxy clusters would form because of inflation. Evidence for this can be seen in the cosmic microwave background. So the universe would be completely different every time you repeated the big bang, and in most versions you would not run out of milk.
Quantum mechanics is not deterministic. If you rewind and replay, it will be different.

Btw, even in a deterministic framework like many worlds you experience indeterminism. In that case, while the big general state evolves deterministically, the indeterminism comes from the fact that your world is a partial state. In other words, the world you'll find yourself in in the end will essentially be a randomly sampled world, therefore different every time.

Other interpretations of QM are purely deterministic more in the sense of hidden variables. If something like de Broglie - Bohm (pilot waves) extends to a fully functional interpretation of QM, then you also will have indeterminism. When rewinding, you don't rewind the underlying classical state, which is hidden; you only rewind the resulting quantum state, which is measurable - this means you won't necessarily reconstruct the original classical state. Therefore it will again play out differently.
I'm gonna ignore the I.e. but yeah quantum effects can have macro applications. [My personal favorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_biology#Photosynthesis) is how plant cells distribute energy gained from photosynthesis. Pretty friggin' weird.
Determinism is not a falsifiable theory.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism)   So there's no scientific answer to your question.


> Do quantum effects *ever* manifest in the macro-world?

Well, in a word, yes. For example, did you post your question from a computer? I think yes. Are you aware that integrated circuits rely on quantum mechanics to function as they do? I think yes again. So it can be said that quantum theories are essential to your computer's operation *and to this conversation*.

> I.e. if we ran back the universe's clocks and rolled the dice again, would the outcome still be the same?

Probably not, but you may be focusing too much attention on the probabilistic aspects of quantum theory. For example, if you flip a coin once, what is the probability that the coin will land on edge? Not very high. But if you flip the coin a million times, what's the probability of getting a million sequential heads outcomes? Also not very high. Is there a role for quantum theory in this outcome? No, not really -- ordinary physical processes can provide an adequate explanation.
I enjoy poking around the Physics Dept web sites of various universities. Some of them post some really nice materials - lecture notes (some are quite detailed), practice problems with solutions, videos and PDFs of seminars, colloquia, and conferences (this is an especially favorite interest of mine), etc. 

For example, for problem sets Harvard's physics dept has posted 90 weeks worth of Problem of the Week along with the solutions.  They're from around 2004, but still a nice resource.  See: https://www.physics.harvard.edu/academics/undergrad/problems
Do you have any books left from when you were still studying? I'd say that's the best way to get specific knowledge back up.Hyperphysics would be the only comprehensive albeit very concise physics encyclopedia/website I can think of. It is by no means a website to solve problems, but I think those sites would be hard to find anyway.
I recommend reading the quantum mechanics theoretical minimum book by Lenny Susskind and Art Friedman. You may already know a lot in there, but it's a great motivator to get back into the swing of things. I have heard the classical mechanics one is also good, but perhaps that would be a little simple for what you're looking for...

Also, starting study on a new field you haven't dipped in yet might prove fruitful! For example, if you'd like to learn GR, Sean Carroll's book Spacetime and Geometry is a great place to start. And you get to learn some dope math along the way!! 

Enjoy doing physics again!! =)
Schaum Outlines and Morin's problem books are probably sufficient for mechanics and E&M. 

Going a step further, you could use something like Anki to schedule review of problems you've solved. 
I love Henry's videos and I understand he's simplifying for the audience, but he's missing some caveats that I think are important to truly call it a *complete* solution.

Where is the asymmetry between the twins? The travelling twin also see the stay-at-home twin travel on an accelerated path, with a kink in it, changing the planes of simultaneity. It would seem absolute acceleration is important, which the video doesn't mention.

But there are also problems without absolute acceleration. Like, what if the travelling twin slingshots around a planet, instead of using rocket engines to accelerate? He would never experience a proper acceleration, obscuring the asymmetry of the situations. (The difference here being of course that he spend time deep in a gravitational field, and the stay-at-home twin would be very high in it, making time move faster there). Or what if there's two inertially travelling twins, one going east and one going west, and they synchronize clocks at the middle of the trajectory, avoiding any sort of acceleration.

Or what if space is closed, which would mean there would be periodic inertial orbits, where the twins could regularly compare ages. At first sight, the reference frames of the twins would seem completely equivalent. Surprisingly (well, I was surprised when I learnt it), it turns out that in compact spaces, the topology defines an absolute, preferred frame of reference. Both twins would agree on that frame and their respective velocities compared to it, and thus would agree on the discrepancy between the ages.

I do love MinutePhysics of course :) I wish they'd existed when I was young
Okay, so why is the spaceship twin younger, even though both twins maintain the same velocity relative to the other throughout the trip?

I don't feel this resolves the paradox; it only explains it thoroughly.
Are there any videos like this on the Ehrenfest paradox? Because I still cant get my head around that one.
Jesus, I'm leaving this thread more confused than when I entered. 
how do we calculate, from the ship's rest frame, the passage of time on earth during the ship's turnaround/acceleration? for example, how could we calculate a value of 3.6 s without just subtracting?

if for simplicity's sake we assume a constant acceleration, I get that the situation is essentially gravitational time dilation (as if a large body's gravity is causing the ship's acceleration). but I haven't yet covered general relativity in my coursework so I'm just curious how this calculation would be done
It has seemed to me for quite a confusing number of years that the Twins Paradox has more to do with acceleration than velocity.

When the velocity of the ship is constant, each twin sees the other's clock as running slower by the same amount, which cancels each other out, correct?

Then it's only in the acceleration to the constant velocity where the magic happens?

To get to 0.2c (59,958,491.6 m/s), it takes a ship about 70 1/2 days accelerating at a comfortable 9.8m/s^2. [link to online calculator](http://www.smartconversion.com/unit_calculation/Acceleration_calculator.aspx)

So the time dilation of a 10 year trip (from the earth twin's frame of reference) happens only in those 70 1/2 days x4: 1) the initial acceleration to .2c, 2) the negative acceleration at some distant point to earth frame zero, 3) the initial acceleration to .2c heading back to earth, and 4) the final negative acceleration to earth frame zero.

(It seems like the positive and negative accelerations would cancel each other out, but...?)

**tl;dr**

True or False: Whenever the ship is traveling at a constant velocity, both twins age at the same rate.
These facts upset me so much.

I'm a real big fan of thinking we'll be able to get past light speed with no issues (I'm ignoring the power issues, shut it), but then you think about this "time" bullshit and all the fun goes to shit.

Not fair, universe. Not fair.
This really felt like an Abbott and Costello routine, if they did physics.
Hey guys! I had a question regarding general relativity. If I am travelling in a spaceship close to the speed of light and my twin is on Earth, I would have aged way more than him when I return back. The problem I have about this concept, time is relatively slower for me than him. Hence, would I live out a lifespan from Earth's time or my own time? 
Let us assume humans die at 100 years. At age 10, I leave in the spaceship and return back to Earth. My twin is now aged 99 and my age is 12. Would I live 1 more year on Earth or live 88 more?
Thanks

I've started  collecting a list of universities/institutions that post videos of physics lectures, talks, conferences, colloquia etc. The quality is uneven - e.g., some have excellent audio, others spotty or poor audio, some thoughtfully include slides as well as audio and video.  So the ones listed below are some of those that overall I thought are among the best. I'm interested in other recommendations, so if you're part of an institution that hosts physics videos, I'd appreciate your comment with the link. Caveat - this is not about a list of courses, it's about individual talks which are either standalone or part of a conference.

Any of Finns/Swedes that can recommand me a good second hand bookstore/site in Helsinki or Stockholm?
Im an upper year undergraduate student and I'm looking for a good reference text for statistics. Something akin to Mathematical Methods in the Sciences by Boaz, but more focused on regression, statistics testing and dealing with discrete data. Any suggestions?

For context I have never taken a true stats course at my school, but I have had a fairly decent amount of stats covered in labs and courses throughout my undergrad. I would consider myself a beginner in terms of my knowledge of statistics.
Hi I'm looking for something really specfic. A quick and dirty guide to solving undergraduate level mechanics and E&M problems from a symmetry perspective. I know there are textbooks but I'm looking for something short and to the point. Really more of a tutorial than anything. Something that emphasizes problem solving over theory. Anyone know of something like this?
Just started a module on thermodynamics and my prof is so incomprehensible and keeps going off tangent. 

Does anyone have a good book for thermodynamics to recommend?
I feel like this article didn't do enough to address the "cry wolf" concerns, focusing on papers from 1995 to 2001 from a deceased collaborator, but not talking about the more similar papers from 2012 to 2015 from the same group, that [this article discusses](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160607-new-boson-claim-faces-scrutiny/).

Nevertheless, it's good to see all this information in one place. I'll try to be optimistic!
tl;dr li5?
intuition in physics or mathematics is for me knowing whether some result "seems right" (as you say too).

that's completely determined by what you are used to and what experience you have. in mathematics several problems relating to infinity might seem unintuitive to a mathematically untrained person while it might make perfect sense intuitively for a mathematician unfamiliar with this problem but with some experience with related problems. he won't be surprised.

the same is true in quantum mechanics where it is often quoted as producing unintuitive results. they may be unintuitive for someone taking classical mechanics to seriously or not having much experience with quantum mechanics. but i for instance wouldn't call quantum mechanical tunnelling through a barrier counter-intuitive. you wouldn't if you're used to it. there's no such thing as "universally counter-intuitive", it's different from person to person.

anyway, no one will use pure intuition as if it were actual scientific work. it's more something that guides you but in the end you won't rely on some feeling, but you will actually do an experiment or actually calculate a model. i don't think you will ever choose one result over another by pure intuition.
I feel that intuition is pretty inapplicable to physics. Intuition tends to be based on common sense and normal experience, but physics tends to study things that aren't part of the common human experience. When I first studied relativity my book said it best "this may seem counter intuitive but intuition comes from common interactions that very rarely account for things like the speed of light" 
Just a heads up, to physicists saying intuition means something kind of different when we use it as a noun. We usually mean like having a "physical" feeling for something. We say "physical intuition" when we really mean "real-world analogy"...

I think intuition comes up often in experimental physics. I remember in Nuclear labs having to use a lot of intuition being able to work out whether our detector was set up properly, not wanting to wait to collect a full set of results. I think that intuition is really important for the "what next?" steps in building up an experiment and doing research around it.

EDIT: Why do people like /u/TheChineseCoys make threads like this but don't reply when someone posts things? Inconsiderate, especially considering it was the only response. I see that a lot in this sub, people ask a question and then just fuck off...
Why is it that galaxies like this point to dark matter instead of pointing to the idea that our assumptions are incorrect about determining the mass of a galaxy?
I glanced through the paper, it seems like the entire calculation of baryonic mass is based entirely on the luminosity of the galaxy.  I couldn't find any mention of the study doing a spectroscopic analysis of that particular galaxy (only using studies of other UDGs as a baseline), so it doesn't seem like we know for sure what the exact stellar composition of this galaxy could be.  Given this, isn't it a bit premature to say its mass is almost entirely made of dark matter?  It's certainly suspicious and easy to see how one would arrive at this conclusion, but if I'm understanding correctly, this could plausibly be a galaxy which - for whatever reason - appears far less luminous than others in its class.  Could this not be explained by a (admittedly very odd) number of high-density, non-luminous objects in that galaxy?  

Someone please set me straight if I missed some critical aspect of the paper or am being a bit oblivious.


Anybody know how close this galaxy is? Is the universe littered with these objects and we've simply not found them due to their dimness/weirdness? 

Edit: the arxiv paper assumes 101 Mpc... Wow that's close! Now I'm wondering if they have instrument time to do a detailed spectroscopy and determine the types of stars that are visible....
Update: A [Quanta Magazine article dated 9/27/2016](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160927-ultra-diffuse-galaxy-dragonfly-44/) follow-up about this discovery, with various interpretations.  Also, Hubble Space Telescope time is now being devoted to studying this Dragonfly 44 Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy, and a search is on to see if others like this can be found outside of galaxy clusters and closer to us.

I'm still amazed that we don't have a means to detect and study Dark Matter. This is an interesting find! 
"Its mass"
And they named it Dragonfly 44? They should have dubbed it the Chocolate Milky Way, duh.

I won't try and explain it, here's a possibly good answer: http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/13577/photons-in-expanding-space-how-is-energy-conserved
Energy is not conserved in a non-static universe.
I've been stuck with a problem concerning this! I was consider making a thread or waiting until I see another questions of the week thread. 

My question is concerning the Doppler effect and redshift in particular. The light we receive from all the galaxies are redshifted implying that they are traveling away from us. Space is immense(duh we know) and comprehending these distances is impossibly hard for the human brain. Space isn't a perfect vacuum having a few atoms per meter cubed. These atoms would almost definitely be hydrogen, or helium, and continuing down in order of abundance. The amount of meters in one light year is 9.461*10^15. That would make light traveling from those galaxies hundreds of light years away having to interact with atoms at some point on their journey to earth. Could this interaction not impede the photons causing light to appear redshifted to the observe here on earth? If light interacts with heavier elements like iron or lead(ultra rare) could this cause photons wave length to be stretched out and appear red? 

I looked up how light interacts with atoms( emphasizing on it being a few atoms) and found a few things out. Eventually I got to a point where I was having to google search every other word showing I'm in over my head. I appreciate any help with this, I love physics and I'm taking my first course in it this year! I asked my teacher but his response was light has no mass. Which is true, but I didn't fully explain my question so it didn't answer my question entirely. 
I disagree with the conclusion that the new SU(2) must be confining and everything else that follows from that - like that particles must be weak isospin singlets. Last time I did this calculation it turned out the β function was positive (there are too many SU(2) charged fermions).
It's not "1 part in 10^120 ."   Instead, it's that one of the theoretical predictions for the cosmological constant is 10^120 times larger than the cosmological constant that's observed.  (I don't think anything in humanity has ever been measured to 1 part in 10^120 .)
Yes, the cosmological constant is one of a number of physical values that are fundamental to the known structure of the universe such that if their values were outside a limited range, the universe could not support life.  Hence the fine-tuned premise which you can read about at  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe#Examples and http://discovermagazine.com/2000/nov/cover/

If you're interested in this topic of fine-tuning, you may be interested in Martin Rees' book *Just Six Numbers*, which the articles refer to.

Before 1998 there was no direct evidence for a cosmological constant having a non-zero value. The known observational constraints on an upper bound for it were so incredibly small that many physicists suspected that it must be precisely zero. Well, it isn't zero but it is very small and yet if it were sufficiently larger, as the above articles point out, stars and galaxies could not have formed.

It it were zero, Ethan Siegel wrote an article about what the effect would be on our universe: https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/how-would-our-universe-be-different-without-dark-energy-4904aa99acd6#

If it had a negative instead of positive value, the universe - regardless if it is spatially flat or positively or negatively curved - would eventually stop expanding and collapse back in on itself in  a big crunch. 

Current evidence is that the universe is flat and that the cosmological constant will continue to cause the rate of expansion of the universe to accelerate, and thus it will expand forever (or so it's speculated, there are possible caveats based on current understandings).

If you want a little more info on the cosmological constant (also commonly referred to as dark energy), besides the wikipedia article on it, Ethan Siegel wrote about it here: https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/ask-ethan-58-what-is-dark-energy-61db04945b3d#  
Wouldn't that just be angle?
Yes, angular velocity is the time rate of change of angular position. Integration between t1 and t2 gives you the net angular displacement between those times. 
With respect to what? Time? You certainly can. Just like integrating regular velocity over time gives you displacement, integrating angular velocity over time gives you angular displacement.

If you want to integrate with respect to something else, then you might have problems.

Don't sweat the essay. Just don't make glaring grammatical errors, and tell a relevant story. 
The Viridis color map has grown in popularity recently, and does not suffer from Jet's shittyness. I wish it would gain popularity in HEP... Although it appears that a viridis-like map is now a default in ROOT.

There's a good video on it here:
http://matplotlib.org/style_changes.html
It's great that both matlab and matplotlib have adopted better colormaps. It was good to see viridis in the gravitational waves discovrry paper.
I've been doing a lot of image processing lately, but am still a complete noob. Been using jet without a second thought for many data visualizations... Thanks for sharing this
I usually take a look at [colorbrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=9) if I only need a few colors for basic plots. 

edit: for heat/density maps I take one posted [here](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/)
off topic:  I found you.
JET (a tokamak in Europe) was able to sustain a fusion power output of ~4-5 MW for 5 seconds. While this was not a net energy gain, it was still a significant amount of fusion power for a sustained amount of time. I'll also note that this experiment was done in 1997.

The truth is that most magnetic confinement experiments don't actually use D-T fuel. The reason is that tritium operation is really really really expensive. Instead we can make a lot of progress for a fraction of the cost using a surrogate fuel that does not fuse. So while the net power output is the ultimate goal, quoting the record power output isn't really the best metric to summarize the current state magnetic fusion research. There have been 20 years of progress since JET last performed it's record D-T shots. (As far as I know that run campaign was the last time a large scale magnetic fusion experiment used D-T).

Second, I wouldn't say that ITER is "near" its due date. The current schedule predicts that it going to take another ~10 years to construct ITER. Then the plan is to use a surrogate fuel for several years before D-T operation. So if everything goes according to the current plan, then it's still going to be ~15 years before D-T operations in ITER. And thats a big IF. (In 2006 they were predicting that ITER would begin operations around 2016). 

Finally, stars have 2 huge advantages that we can't replicate in fusion devices on earth. The first is gravity. Stars use gravity to confine the plasma. We can't replicate this gravity in an experiment on Earth, so we need some other way to confine the plasma. The second advantage is that stars are really big. So while stars produce a lot of power, the actually have a rather small power density. I've heard the power density in the core of our sun is actually comparable to metabolic rate of a lizard. In fusion power plants we will use a fuel (D-T) that is much more efficient than the fuel of stars. After all a swimming pool sized reactor filled with lizards isn't going to power a city.   
Don't imagine the outcome for ITER is at all certain -- it's an engineering prototype with many uncertainties. The funding for ITER reflects more the enormous value of fusion research than the prospect for a successful conclusion to the project.

Fusion as an engineering project faces some serious challenges, two of which are sustained fusion reaction, and successful confinement. Both have only been approximated, and both remain to be perfected in an engineering sense. I say "engineering" because the science is well-understood, but how to turn the science into a working prototype is the problem.

Then there's the issue of "break-even," in which a fusion reaction produces as much or more energy than it consumes. We have only approached this goal in our best efforts, and we still don't have a sustainable break-even reactor.

So the jury is still out.

The problem with ITER is that scaling up is not really a viable way to make a fusion power plant. If we look at how many countries it is taking to make just this prototype experiment, and some of the technology for it hasn't even been invented yet and may never be (like the wall material for the plasma container), then this direction doesn't really look promising. It is a good science experiment, that will teach us a lot, but the future probably lies in smaller scale stuff.

MIT's SPARC project looks more promising. General Fusion in Vancouver is also interesting. There are a lot of small scale experiments going on.

>From what I have Read the longest fusion reaction made by humans was milliseconds. 

https://www.iter.org/

i think all your questions are answered here.

>could we potentially aim to make a form of fusion? closer to that of a red dwarf.

i don't think we compare a fusion reactor to any kind of star. stars are very inefficient at doing fusion. they rely on their huge gravitational pressure and mass to achieve any meaningful amount of energy through fusion that is rather rarely happening due to the low temperature (but often in absolute numbers, because there's just... many particles in it). iter is aiming to be much more efficient than that.
since copying a star isn't feasible, basing fusion reactor concepts on what certain type stars do doesn't make much sense.

besides not having achieved net energy with previous experimental reactors doesn't mean anything. if you burn a crumb of cole you won't get more energy out of it than the lighter took to ignite it. it has to burn longer and more of it has to burn. with fusion it's similar, plus the fact that what limits the time a plasma can burn is heat loss which is easier to account for if you just have a bigger device (so far small devices were built, larger ones being more expensive, iter should be large enough now). the energy in the plasma is proportional to the volume, while the heat loss is proportional to the surface area, so if you were to double all dimensions the volume grows by a factor of 8 but the surface area just by a factor of 4. so it gets easier.
He hits upon most of the talking points for the Maxwell's demon thought experiment but doesn't really seem to have all of the pieces together and propagates common misconceptions I've frequently seen.

First, the modern notation of entropy can't really be captured by something as vague as "how close the molecules are together." If you know the exact configuration of molecules in a chamber, the entropy of the collection is zero. And this generalizes to the quantum case very directly as the VN entropy.

Second, Landauer never discussed Maxwell's demon. The connection between information and entropy was really made by Bennett in 1983.

Thirdly, for some reason everyone treats the connection between physical entropy (really should be called Gibbs entropy) and information entropy as some mystical thing. It's not. The Shannon entropy is just the Gibbs entropy of the smallest system that can encode some amount of information after dividing out the Boltzmann constant.

There are quite a few of these things in a pretty important subject that has been mystified for too long.
Isn't this the Sherlock Holmes villain?

I've mostly followed the academic route (currently a postdoc) but I've had a few deviations. 

Immediately after I finished my undergrad, I started working in an ultrasound research lab in a hospital. This was basically similar work to what a master's student would do. A year and a half later I started grad school and did that for the next six years, but towards the end of my master's I picked up a part-time consulting job where I was mostly looking at public health data and developing numerical models that would forecast them. This was an interesting experience (and generally much easier than research-level physics) that I think was very worthwhile.
Went on to do a PhD in quantum information (towards the end of the 90's). After that, founded a company that has since integrated another one. I am now a product manager.

I'm in the extremely fortunate position of starting a graduate scheme as a scientist. I expect that on top of learning new specific information related to the company's needs, I will have to remember stuff from my Physics Masters degree.

I'm concerned about my ability to do this. After a reasonable long and very much needed break between my degree ending and my job starting, I feel my brain is void of all physics and maths knowledge. But this is probably to be expected with lack of practice and poor memory stemming from moderate dyslexia. I have a month to study after I come back off my holiday which I will be using but I do worry about forgetting it with the stresses of a new job.

So my question to you is this: How do you keep the basic relavent knowledge from your degree fresh and stable, while also using and building on it? I really want to do well in this job, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
I am currently about to be a senior physics major and I plan to apply to MS programs for mechanical and materials engineering. While I know that physics majors transitioning to engineering is fairly common, I am curious as to how potential employers would react to seeing a BS in Physics as opposed to engineering on my resume. 

I am hoping someone else here has followed the same path as me and can comment on how their job search was: did the physics major help or hurt your engineering job prospects? Did not being able to get your PE truly hurt you?
Can anyone who has done a clinical job in medical physics (by that I mean in a radiation oncology department, imaging department etc) but then transitioned elsewhere talk a little bit about your experience, why you left, what it has been like since you moved?

Thanks in advance!
What salary should I expect for my first job after getting my physics degree?

I graduated this spring with a physics BS, and since then I've been looking for jobs. I finally got my first offer! However, I'm worried that the pay might be much lower than I should be aiming for.

For context, I live somewhere where the cost of living is about the national average. The pay for this job is in the mid-30's (thousand per year). One thing to note is that I am very limited geographically since I'm not going to move, so that may mean that I should expect a little less pay. However, I do live in an area with a lot of universities, technology, biotech, medicine, pharmacy, etc.

I know, of course, my decision should depend on how much I like the position, what my expenses are, what kind of lifestyle I want, etc. I *know*. I'm just asking, is this terrible pay for a physics graduate?
If you find any errors, just PM me. Feel free to play around with it!
Wouldn't there be eternal storms on tidally locked planets. I would think that the temperature differential would cause huge pressure differences.
[insert aliens meme].
On a more serious note, I hope the breakthroughinitiatives will succeed and that the planet has life. In my lifetime that is.
Tidally locked.... that's so fucking disappointing.
Something I've always wondered with these tidally-locked planets - wouldn't it be likely to produce spin perpendicular to the plane of the system, like with Uranus? With the pole always pointing to the sun?
There is a lot of snow and ice on top of Everest, but that' s in the death zone.
I imagine a scenario... We suspect this planet may host life, and possibly intelligent life, but how do we communicate with them? How do we know they will be able to receive a message? We can't necessarily use radio, what frequency do they use? However, the ability to detect light is almost universal for complex organisms living above ground. Surely they can see. We use mirrors reflecting light towards this planet, such as the solar glare farms that exist in the deserts of Nevada just south of Las Vegas. We can send a rhythmic message that could not be mistaken for an accident. Maybe they have been watching our "Goldilocks" planet for millennia, looking for signs of life. Finally they get a message, and they send one back. That would be cool. Something like a 9 year feedback loop.
Why not learn computer programming, numerical simulation, and numerical modeling of different kinds of surfaces? This is all relatively easy programming, and it's very useful work that might lead to publication.

> ... to "prove" the dinosaurs' extincion ...

Not likely. The issues surrounding this theory can't be resolved with a relatively simple model that describes what would happen if an asteroid collided with earth. There is much more to it than that.

There's no doubt about the extinction. Where doubt lies is in the exact sequence of events, the rate of extinction, and the apparent fact that many dinosaur species were becoming extinct before the arrival of the asteroid.

Can anyone here explain [this step](http://imgur.com/3UMoZ7H)? There's apparently something important missing. "Oh he used Lagrangian formalism and got this". Yeah well, seeing what he did is the interesting thing! How is that energy-momentum-(non)tensor `[; t_{\mu}^{\sigma} ;]` of the gravitational field even defined? Seriously, the jump from 2.1 to 2.2 is so huge that I would think whoever wrote this paper had problems with that step, too, and just wants to brush over it.
Thanks for the link to this paper, great to have this reference.  

In reading about it, I came across a similar article in *Physics Today* by Michel Janssen and Jürgen Renn, so I thought I'd mention it:

This is not how gravitational waves are measured. Gravitational waves don't have a height like waves on the sea, instead they have an amplitude that has the potential to induce accelerations in masses, roughly like an electromagnetic wave's ability to move electrons in a conductor.

> Or would his atoms be relatively unaffected by the momentary stretching?

This would depend entirely on the amplitude of the waves -- and amplitude can't be equated with height as in your earlier example.

If my textbooks are any indication, many physicists have had wives who are constantly nagging them to, "expand it as a Taylor series and cut off higher order terms" 
A while ago I saw a webpage, aimed at mathematicians, that would jokingly create a new phrase every time you refreshed the page, saying "Just look at the problem as a (one area of maths) (operator or process) (another area of maths)!!!"  - randomly generated, of course, it was mostly always complete nonsense, but hilarious nonetheless and sometimes made you think.  i.e. "Just think of it as a affine symmetry group embedded in a hyperbolic torus!" or "Look at it like noncommutative rational functions projected over all manifolds of nonpositive curvature!!"  it was funny.  I wish I could find it back again. 
In soft matter (and other fields I'm sure): "What happens if you take hydrodynamics into account?"
A great one that we learned from our graduate QM1 professor: "first simple; then correct". If you have a difficult problem, strip it of as much complications as you can. Make sure you have a solid and full understanding of this basic and oversimplified version of your problem. Once you've done that, you can go back to the complex problem with a solid basis of knowledge and intuition. Helped me many times.

Haven't dealt with that myself. But for whatever it's worth, you went through grad school, you learned the culture of physics, you got paid to shoot things with lasers, and you'll always have that. Even if you go into a totally unrelated field, you'll still be a physicist. 
You'll say, "Hi, I-am-lasers, CEO of xyz, LLC."

Recommend getting some sweet business cards.
"I can run, but I am not a runner.  I know how to swim, but I am not a swimmer.  I learned how to ride a bicycle, but I am not a cyclist.  I may not always be shooting things with lasers ... however, I am and will always be a physicist."

If you've already accepted that label as part of your identity, you don't necessarily need to always be working in the field actively, to be described by that label.  You still approach solving problems from a physics perspective, you still have your knowledge, training, and experience.  You still have the curiosity about how the universe works and perhaps keep up with current developments in the field.  Once it become part of who you are ... can it ever really leave you, unless you voluntarily rip it from your identity and renounce it?  There are no limits when it comes to labels, it's not like you can only have a limited number and have to give some up to accept new ones.  Especially if you are a quantum physicist, they are quite good at eschewing the law of the excluded middle and accepting superpositions of labels that are traditionally mutually exclusive. ;)
Lol, I'm actually going through the same thing. I'm nearing the end of my PhD and I'm not sure, whether I want to stay in academia or do other stuff (non science). It's kind of crisis of motivation. But over the years, much of my identity has been built around science and me being a scientist, and I'm not sure how to deal with that.
I also shoot stuff with the laser btw :D
Physics World (magazine of the Institute of Physics) has a regular feature where they interview people who left physics to [do something completely different](http://physicsworld.com/cws/search?page=1&query=%22once+a+physicist%22&dateSort=false). It's not something I've done myself, but many of my friends have.

I think the important thing is just to make sure you're doing something worthwhile that makes you happy.
Curiously I'm going through the same situation but in the reverse direction. Next month I'll be graduating in Architecture and will start to study Physics in another college. I'm not sure what I'll make of my Architecture degree and that costs me a lot because it was 5 years of hard work and I really like it, as much as I like Physics.
But I guess it is like /u/CondMatTheorist said, 'one could also see this less as a crisis and more an "identity opportunity" to build more identity, instead of losing your old one.'. Cool way to think.
Been there, done that. Did undergrad in physics, masters in science ed. and I'm currently running a theater and doing theater technician work. Being a physicist isn't about doing "physics", it's about understanding how the world functions around you. You'll find a way to apply the things you've learned to future endeavors and love every second of it.

If anything, being a physicist just means you chose to tell the world that your curious.
I'm not a theorist (my experience is all on the side of 'getting the measurements'), so the following is not based off rigourous study, nor do I know the 'proper' answer.

However, I can see two key points where your description might not be complete, that would suggest resolutions to the apparent problem.

> My confusion arises because N+ and N- do not commute with Jµ (x), so both cannot be measured at once. 

Who says that they _are_ measured at the same time?  The detectors are large. multi layered instruments, and they require a certain degree of 'luck' in order to get a clear reading.  (That is why statistics are used all over the analysis, and why high luminosity is so critical.)  So it _may_ be that the various quantities are measured, but never in the same interaction.  (Don't know if that's right, just throwing out there.)

Secondly: 

> The particle tracks reconstructed from the measured electrical signals represent a fixed number of particles — i.e. they are evidence that the asymptotically late state is an eigenstate of total particle number N+ and total anti-particle number N- .

It is well known that the detectors do not, and cannot give either of those numbers with certainty and precision.  (Again, that's why the statistical power is so important when looking at the results).  Particles that are formed along the axis of the beam line will be undetectable (putting a detector there will get it burnt out in no time), and two particles following the same path will be indistinguishable.  Indeed, even separating detected particles out into which interaction they occur in is non-trivial (but that's _usually_ worked out without too much difficulty).

Hopefully that helps, given that I don't actually know what ' Jµ (x) of a charged field' actually means…

On your point c:

>  The spatial resolution of a tracking device is several orders of magnitude higher than the Compton wavelengths of the particles being detected. 

The pixel size of the detectors varies throughout the device (there's lots of trade offs, including cost to build, that apply).  For Atlas they are at the smallest 50 um by 400 um (yep, not square) [0], which is a lot larger than those wavelengths you were talking about.  They are arranged in slanted spiral, with a layer over them spiralling in the other direction, so that the effective pixel size is smaller, once you correlate from multiple pixels; but that has it's own issues.

I think that what you're getting at there is the same thing I was outlining as my second point - these detectors are not precise enough to worry about the theoretical limits of detection, as the practical limits are _much_ coarser than that.  If so, yes, that's certainly true.

(And if not, sorry, I didn't follow the theory side fully; just trying to offer what perspective I can).
