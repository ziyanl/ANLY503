I SEE A LOT OF MIXED OPINIONS ON HERE BUT ONE THING NOBODY IS CALLING OUT IS THE FIRST EDITION SCOUT HANDBOOK I'M NOT SURE WHY YOU'D READ THAT OVER A CURRENT SCOUT HANDBOOK AS I'M SURE ANYTHING STILL WORTH TEACHING IS STILL IN THE CURRENT EDITION AS WELL AS MANY NEW MODERN TRICKS AND PHILOSOPHIES ON SCOUTING
SHARING AN ART OF MANLINESS BLOG POST ON REDDIN AND R BOOKS OF ALL PLACES THIS SHOULD GO WELL
I FOLLOWED ART OF MANLINESS FOR A SHORT TIME IT'S MAINLY HERE'S SOME SHIT YOU NEED TO BUY IN ALMOST EVERY POST AND MOST OF WHAT THEY'RE SELLING IS HIPSTER CRAP I THINK WHEN THEY POSTED THE BEST BEARD WAX I QUIT FOLLOWING
THERE ARE A LOT OF ON THIS LIST
WELL ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE WAS ON THE LIST SO OK

MANLY LESSON FROM THAT ONE WAS THE BEER CAN SHIM
I SEE A LOT OF FOLK DISMISSING THE AM AS SOME INSECURE SHILL OF A BLOG BUT I'VE READ A LOT OF QUALITY ARTICLES ON THAT SITE THAT HAVE IMPROVED MY RELATIONSHIPS AND HAVE MADE ME A MORE THOUGHTFUL COURAGEOUS PERSON THEY HAVE ONE OF THE BEST ARTICLES ON HOW TO POLITELY RESOLVE DISAGREEMENTS WITH A PARTNER I'VE EVER READ

THE

AM DOES FETISHIZE THE PAST A TOUCH BUT IT DOES NOT DO SO SLAVISHLY THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BELIEVE THE PAST HAS SOMETHING TO TEACH US AND SEEING THE PAST AS IDYLLIC
LOT OF GOOD BOOKS MALES SHOULD READ BUT THE FACT THEY MADE IT ONE HUNDRED LONG AND JUST ADDED GENERIC WELL KNOWN GOOD BOOKS TO FILL OUT THE LIST REALLY TOOK AWAY FROM IT
I'M SURPRISED FIGHT CLUB ISN'T THERE
I HAVE READ QUITE A FEW OF THOSE INCLUDING THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
SILLY LIST WHO OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIC CIRCLES WOULD READ WEALTH OF NATIONS INSTEAD OF A MODERN INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS IT WOULD BE LIKE READING A PAMPHLET BY JENNER TO LEARN ABOUT COMMUNICABLE DISEASE
I MUST BE PRETTY MANLY WOMAN THEN
WEALTH OF NATIONS THE BIBLE THE GREAT GATSBY ATLAS SHRUGGED ULYSSES FOR EVERY GOOD BOOK THERE'S A VERY QUESTIONABLE BOOK ON THE LIST A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE PROBABLY READ A LOT OF THESE ANYWAY SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE A LIST OF CLASSICS AND HIGH SCHOOL COLLEGE READING NOT THAT THAT'S A BAD THING BUT WHY NOT TRY TO FIND SOME THINGS THAT STAND OUT FROM THE NORMAL BUNCH A BIT

ALSO HOW MANLY CAN THIS LIST BE I'M LIKE THE LEAST MANLY GUY I KNOW AND I'VE PROBABLY READ OVER HALF OF THESE THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD STUFF HERE THOUGH SO SOME OF IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH LOOKING AT

ONE FINAL THOUGHT MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT A COUPLE SENTENCES ON EACH BOOK ABOUT WHY IT'S ON THE LIST RATHER THAN JUST A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE BOOK WE CAN ALL READ THE AMAZON DESCRIPTION OR THE BOOK JACKET
I DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH WRITING LISTS BUT I FEEL LIKE THIS ONE IS PERHAPS A BIT POINTLESS THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME GOOD BOOKS ON THERE BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COME UP WITH A LIST OF THIS SIZE WHAT QUALIFIES A BOOK APART FROM IT BEING A DECENT READ I UNDERSTAND THE WEBSITE IS AIMED AT MEN SO REALLY IT HAD TO BE A LIST OF BOOKS MEN SHOULD READ IN SOME WAY BUT HOW AND WHY WERE THOSE BOOKS CHOSEN

ANYWAY I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE SELECTIONS I DO THINK FOR EXAMPLE THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD READ SOME ERNEST HEMINGWAY AS A LOT OF HIS BOOKS ARE ABOUT MASCULINITY BUT REALLY A LOT OF BOOKS MENTIONED SHOULD BE READ BY EVERYBODY NOT JUST MEN

AS SOMEBODY ELSE POINTED OUT THOUGH MOST OF THESE BOOKS WERE WRITTEN BY MEN WHILE THEY GIVE A MAN'S POINT OF VIEW SURELY TO BE A ROUNDED PERSON YOU NEED TO ALSO READ BOOKS BY THE OPPOSITE SEX AS WELL BUT IT'D BE HARD FOR THE LIST WRITER TO DO SO IF THEY HAVEN'T READ MANY BOOKS BY WOMEN

I'D BE INTERESTED TO SEE A SIMILAR LIST AIMED AT WOMEN AS IT MIGHT INTEREST ME MORE
SO JUST A BUNCH OF CLASSICS AND SOME CHOICE PICKS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED MANLY

THAT'S ORIGINAL

GOOD TO SEE BLOGS KEEPING UP CONTENTION
DID BUZZFEED BUY THEM OUT
WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT AM HAS A DEFINITE SLANT TO IT I'VE BEEN A SUBSCRIBER FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY USUALLY HAVE GOOD COLUMNS AND LISTS

THIS IS ONE OF THE BETTER ESSENTIAL BOOK LISTS I'VE READ
I USED TO FOLLOW AM QUITE A BIT ABOUT YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE SMALLER IT GOT ME INTO SHAVING WITH A SAFETY RAZOR INSTEAD OF BUYING CARTRIDGES I'D NEVER GO BACK

THERE ARE SOME GREAT ARTICLES ABOUT MANLY ATTITUDES AND DIFFERENT WAYS OF HANDLING THINGS THAT A LOT OF GUYS MAY NOT EVER KNOW ABOUT OTHERWISE

HOWEVER A LOT OF IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO CREATE THIS STEREOTYPICAL S MAN WHO LISTENS TO OLD MUSIC AND ONLY USES VINTAGE STUFF BECAUSE A WEBSITE TELLS THEM THAT'S WHAT REAL MEN DO
IT'S DISHEARTENING THAT MOST PEOPLE ON THIS THREAD ARE DISCREDITING THE VALUE OF READING THESE BOOKS BECAUSE OF THE WEBSITE THAT FACILITATED THE LIST THE BREADTH OF THE SUBJECT MATTER COVERED BY THE LIST HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SPARK A PERSON'S INTEREST INTO DELVING DEEPER INTO MANY DIFFERENT SUBJECTS HISTORY PHILOSOPHY ECONOMICS ENGLISH LITERATURE AND SO ON SURELY THIS IS A VALUABLE PURSUIT ADDITIONALLY MANY OF THE MORAL IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL DOCTRINES IN THE BOOKS ARE DIVERSE AND OFTEN IN CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER AYN RAND AND ALASDAIR MACINTYRE ARE ON THE SAME LIST FOR GOODNESS SAKE

THIS IS A SUBREDDIT DEVOTED TO READING IN CASE ANYBODY HAS FORGOTTEN THAT
I'VE COLLECTED THIS INTO A LIST CHALLENGE IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED

AND OF COURSE IF ANYONE CONNECTED WITH THE ARTICLE WOULD LIKE IT TAKEN DOWN I GUESS I CAN DO THAT
I WOULD LOVE IT IF MORE MEN WOULD READ EAT PRAY LOVE INSTEAD OF NOT READING IT BUT JOKING ABOUT IT NONETHELESS MAYBE THIS IS JUST A PROBLEM IN MY VERY MILLENNIAL SOCIAL GROUP I DON'T KNOW IT'S A DAMN GOOD TRAVEL NARRATIVE AND REALLY ENTERTAINING
THESE SORT OF LISTS ARE A BIT SILLY BUT IT IS FUN TO PLAY ALONG

I ALWAYS SHAKE MY HEAD WHEN I SEE ULYSSES BY JAMES JOYCE INCLUDED IN THEM

IN THIS INSTANCE NO MAN HAS EVER READ THAT BOOK BECAUSE ANYONE WHO IS A MAN ACCORDING TO THAT WEBSITE IS MOST LIKELY GOING TO COME TO THEIR SENSES AND GIVE UP ON ULYSSES AFTER HOURS OF READING OR PAGES WHICHEVER COMES FIRST
ALL THAT WAR AND NO THE THINGS THEY CARRIED
I'M MANLY ENOUGH AT OF THE BOOKS ALREADY FINISHED GOT MAH BEARD WORK IN A WOOD SHOP SMELL LIKE CEDAR AND SWEAT DRINK WHISKEY AND FUCK BUTTS MANLY AF
AN AD BLOCKED THE LIST AND ALLOWED NO WAY AROUND IT
TO SAVE YOU A CLICK YOUR HIGH SCHOOL READING LIST MINUS ALICE WALKER AND THE BRONTES
I HATE STUFF LIKE THIS THERE'S NO BARRIER TO ENTRY TO BE A REAL MAN WOMAN BRACING MYSELF FOR SOME EDGY RESPONSES ALL THE PREREQUISITES FOR MANLINESS SEEM TO BOIL DOWN TO EMBARRASSING GENTLEMAN STEREOTYPES
I HATE LISTS LIKE THIS X THINGS ONLY REAL MEN DO HOW ABOUT REAL MEN DO WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT AND DON'T HAVE TO ADHERE TO YOUR INCREDIBLY NARROW STANDARDS BY READING THE BOOKS YOU SELECTED BECAUSE OF REASONS
A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES BY JOHN KENNEDY TOOLE

THIS IS THE FUNNIEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ NOT SURE IF IT SHOULD BE ON THE MANLINESS BLOG
I READ A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES AND FOUND IN IGNATIUS REILLY MY LITERARY DOPPELGANGER IT'S A LITTLE BIT DISTURBING TO FIND YOURSELF MIRRORED IN A BOOK BUT I STILL THINK IT'S A MUST READ FOR ALL BASEMENT DWELLING NECK BEARDS OUT THERE
IT'S LIKE HE GRABBED ALL THE TOP CLICHE BOOKS THAT EVERYONE SHOULD READ IN THEIR LIFE AND MADE AN ARTICLE OUT OF IT

PEOPLE YOU SHOULD READ BOOKS THAT EXCITE YOU THAT MAKE YOU WANT TO READ MORE THAT MAKE YOU WANT TO LEARN AND GROW NOT SOME LIST THAT SOME GUY SAYS YOU HAVE TO READ OR ELSE YOU AREN'T A MAN

WHAT A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT
SIDDHARTHA REALLY NEEDS TO BE ON THIS LIST IT'S AN AMAZING BOOK FOR FINDING SPIRITUALITY AND INNER PEACE
I KNOWN IT'LL BE UNPOPULAR BUT I THINK THIS IS A DECENT LIST I WILL NEVER READ THEM ALL BUT I'VE READ PROBABLY OF THEM ALREADY AND EACH HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON VIEW OF THE WORLD


REALLY THIS SHOULD BE CALLED THE BOOKS YOU READ IN HIGHSCHOOL AS A VEHEMENT FAN OF BRAVE NEW WORLD THE BLURB INCLUDED IN THIS LIST ISN'T EVEN ACCURATE TO THINK THAT BERNARD MARX IS THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE NOVEL IS FOOLISH THE POWER OF THE NOVEL COMES FROM THE INTRODUCTION AND NARRATIVE OF JOHN THE SAVAGE A SMALL NITPICK I KNOW BUT TO ME IT INDICATES THAT THIS LIST IS JUST SOMEBODY TRYING TO MAKE THEMSELVES SEEM MORE INTELLIGENT BY LISTING BOOKS THEY THINK THAT SMART PEOPLE READ
GAVE UP AFTER ATLAS SHRUGGED POPPED UP GARBAGE PHILOSOPHY GARBAGE AUTHOR GARBAGE BOOK
ONE THING I'M NOTICING IS A SERIOUS LACK OF LITERATURE BY FEMALE AUTHORS

YES THERE ARE A FEW UP THERE AYN RAND JANE AUSTEN ETC I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF THE CLASSICS ARE WRITTEN BY MEN AND THAT THIS IS A LIST IS FOR MEN BUT STILL THERE ARE PLENTY OF AWARD WINNING BOOKS THAT TOUCH OF THE SUBJECT OF MASCULINITY IN SOME FORM THAT ARE WRITTEN BY WOMEN
A WEIRD WIDE RANGE OF GENRES AND TITLES

SEEMS LIKE A DECENT LIST DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE THEME BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME ACCLAIMED NOVELS

MIGHT BE OF USE FOR THE FUTURE CONSIDERING THE SELF-RELIANCE TITLES
BERSERK SHOULD BE ON THIS LIST
BIGGEST THING FOR ME ABOUT THE LIST WAS THE LACK OF MODERNITY AND ALSO THE LACK OF WOMEN
YOU MADE A LIST OF BOOKS MEN SHOULD READ WHY ARE ONLY OF THEM WRITTEN BY WOMEN LIKE NO FLANNERY O'CONNOR AT ALL EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC SHORT STORY WRITERS OF HER TIME
NOT A SINGLE BUKOWSKI
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE WEALTH OF NATIONS AND THEORY OF MORAL SENTIMENTS IS THAT THE PROSE IS PRETTY IMPENETRABLE IT'S A HARD HARD SLOG TO GET THROUGH SOME OF THOSE SENTENCES AND FIGURE OUT WHAT SMITH WAS TRYING TO SAY SOMEBODY NEEDS TO WRITE AN MEV
REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE SITE ITSELF THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD LIST OF BOOKS FOR EITHER GENDER
ALMOST ALL OF THIS IS ON YOUTUBE JUST CREATED A LIST FOR THE ONES THAT INTEREST ME NON FICTION NOTE THAT THIS LIST IS KIND OF BS NOT A SINGLE SCIENCE BOOK

TOP 2 SHOULD BE THIS

THE GREAT COURSES THE JOY OF SCIENCE A MUST LISTEN FOR ALL OF HUMANITY
THE GREAT COURSES THE ORIGIN OF LIFE
I ONLY SEE ONE PROBLEM IN THIS LIST A LOT OF IT SEEMS TO BE INTENDED AS MODELS OF SUPERB PEOPLE THAT THE READER CAN LEARN TO IN SOME WAY EMULATE AS A TEACHER I LOVE THAT MODELS ARE A GREAT WAY TO LEARN MANY THINGS AND EVERY PERSON READING THIS CAN PROBABLY SAY EXACTLY HOW THEIR PARENTS ACTIONS SHAPED THE PERSON THEY ARE TODAY THIS ISSUE TO ME IS THAT MANY OF THESE WORKS MODEL POOR HUMANS AS EXEMPLARS OR EVEN WORSE MAKE BEHAVIORS ABSTRACT DEHUMANIZED AND DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WITHOUT A LOT OF HELP MANY OF THESE BOOKS ARE EFFECTIVELY UNREADABLE AT LEAST IN TERMS OF READING FOR DEEP COMPREHENSION AND PERSONAL GROWTH FOR THE AVERAGE MANUAL
LOST ME AT ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE TRIED READING IT IT'S A PRETENTIOUS AND OUTDATED PIECE OF SHIT
WHAT DOES BEING A MAN HAVE TO DO WITH IT AND IS A LOT OR IS IT HECK ONE ROMANCE SERIES CAN BE DAMN I WONDER HOW MANY BOOKS I'VE READ

HOW IS THERE NO BUKOWSKI ON THIS LIST
I WOULD SAY DON'T START WITH A LIST IF YOU CAN EVEN READ ONE HUNDRED BOOKS OF YOUR CHOOSING THAT'S AN ACCOMPLISHMENT IN AND OF ITSELF TRY ONE YOU ARE CURIOUS ABOUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT TRY ANOTHER
NO MAN OR WOMAN SHOULD READ STEPHEN AMBROSE THE MAN WAS A HACK
MOST OF THESE ARE JUST BASIC LITERATURE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD READ THOUGH

I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PERTAIN SPECIFICALLY TO MEN


THESE ARE ALL BOOKS I'D LIKE TO READ BUT DON'T HAVE THE EYESIGHT
I'M I HAVE SEEN MOST OF THE FILM VERSIONS I KNOW THAT DOESN'T COUNT I HAVE THREE CHILDREN A WIFE A HOME AND A DOG AND A CAREER CAN I STILL CARRY MY MAN CARD
I'M GOING TO CLOSE MY EYES AND PICK A BOOK FROM THIS LIST TO READ OVER WINTER BREAK

LANDS ON THE BIBLE

FUCK
GREAT PICKS
STUNNED TO SEE A AFTER VIRTUE ON THIS LIST I CAN'T IMAGINE A JUMPING INTO THAT TEXT AND MAKING SENSE OF IT WITHOUT SOME INTRODUCTORY MATERIAL TO MAKE SENSE OF WHAT MACINTYRE IS ARGUING A WORTHY WORTHY READ BUT PROBABLY NOT ACCESSIBLE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY WITHOUT READING SOME OF THE TEXTS IT IS ENGAGING


WHY DOES THIS NEED TO SPECIFY THAT MEN SHOULD READ THESE BOOKS COULDN'T BOTH GENDERS BENEFIT FROM UNDERSTANDING ALL THESE TEXTS
GREAT LIST THANK YOU FOR MAKING A LIST AND NOT SOME BULLSHIT SLIDE SHOW WHERE EACH BOOK IS ON ONE PAGE FILLED WITH ADS
MOBY DICK
THIS IS DOPE
THANKS FOR POSTING
POST FIRST HAD ME THINKING I WONDER WHAT MAKES THESE SPECIFICALLY BOOKS THE BLOGGER THINKS MEN SHOULD READ

SEVERAL FOCUS ON WAR ECONOMICS MORALS ETHICS NATURE SURVIVAL MAKE AN APPEARANCE FRIENDSHIP IS IN THERE COUPLE OF TOO NOT A LOT OF ROMANCE AND TOO LITTLE SCI-FI AND HUMOR IMO OF NOTE WHITE AND WESTERN MALE AUTHORS ARE HEAVILY REPRESENTED BOOKS ARE SOLELY WRITTEN BY MEN FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH

READ ABOUT A QUARTER OF THESE READ ANOTHER CHUNK IN EXCERPTS OR SOMETHING ELSE BY THE AUTHOR SOME OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS AND WRITERS ARE HERE

GATSBY IS IN MY TOP AS ARE A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING AND A HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE THE STRANGER SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE AND CYRANO DE BERGERAC ARE GREAT STEINBECK VONNEGUT TWAIN MARQUEZ KEROUAC TZOLKIN WRIGHT KRAKAUER DOSTOEVSKY AUSTEN HESSE AND BRADBURY ARE ALL SOLID AND ANYTHING BY THEM HAS BEEN WORTH THE READ

NOT SURE I WANT TO WADE THROUGH MORE OF THESE HISTORICAL CLASSIC PHILOSOPHICAL BOOKS PERSONALLY AND FOR MY TASTE A SOLID SUMMARY OFTEN WORKS
NO GRAHAM GREENE IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFICATION
THE BIBLE GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK
DOES IT MAKE ME A BAD FEMALE THAT I'VE READ A GREAT DEAL OF THESE
FANTASTIC LIST HIGH QUALITY BUT ALSO ENJOYABLE BOOKS


I DISAGREE OF COURSE WITH SOME PICKS BUT THE ONLY WAY TO AGREE WITH A TOP LIST IS TO WRITE IT YOURSELF
WELL I'M IN THE MOOD FOR SOME DOWNVOTES BECAUSE IT'S MY BIRTHDAY SO HERE GOES IF YOU MAKE A LIST AND CALL IT LOTS OF GREAT BOOKS FOR MEN AND YOU PUT GENERICALLY GOOD OR IMPORTANT BOOKS ON THERE THAT AREN'T ABOUT MANLINESS YOU IMPLY THAT THEY ARE FOR MEN FOR OTHER REASONS I EAST WOMEN ARE TOO DUMB TO UNDERSTAND MEN NEED TO KNOW THIS STUFF BECAUSE WE HAVE THE MORE IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY ETC YOU'RE SAYING GOOD AND AWESOME THINGS ARE FOR MEN IN OTHER WORDS GOOD OLD SEXISM SIMILAR TO VINTAGE SEXISM WHERE THE MALE BIRTHRIGHT OF THE PRIMARY SEX WAS SLIGHTLY LESS ASSUMED AND A LITTLE MORE SOMETHING YOU HAD TO ACTIVELY ASSERT SO HERE WE ARE WITH A SEXIST LIST ALRIGHT IF I SAY IT IS SEXIST ON REDDIN I WILL GET MASSIVELY DOWNVOTED FOR BEING PC AN SW OR A FEMINIST WHICH IS POISON ON REDDIN ON ANY SUB EXCEPT THE SUBS LIKE OR FEMINISMS YOU MIGHT AS WELL CONFESS TO BEING A CHILD MOLESTER IF IT WAS A LIST OF BOOKS FOR WOMEN AND THERE WERE GENERIC GOOD BOOKS ON THERE IT WOULDN'T MAKE FRONT PAGE BUT GUARANTEE SOMEONE WOULD SAY THESE BOOKS WOULD BE FINE FOR MEN TOO OR EVEN GO AS FAR AS ACTUALLY I THINK SOME OF THESE BOOKS ARE MORE SUITED FOR MEN FOLLOWED BY A DISCLAIMER THAT THE PERSON WRITING IS NOT SEXIST BUT BLAH BLAH COMPLICATED REASONING BASICALLY AS A FATHER OF A DAUGHTER I AM JUST FUCKING SICK OF IT ALL IT'S LIKE A FUCKING IMPENETRABLE WALL OF BLIND PRIVILEGE AND UTTER IRRATIONAL DENIAL AND I GUARANTEE I WILL GET DOZENS OF RESPONSES TO EVEN THIS COMMENT ABOUT HOW THIS LIST IS NOT REALLY SEXIST AND I SHOULD SHUT MY HOLE MY DAUGHTER IS AND SHE'S READING AT A 3RD GRADE LEVEL AND GOD DAMMIT THESE BOOKS ARE BOOKS I WANT TO SEE HER READING WHEN SHE'S IN COLLEGE THESE BOOKS ARE NOT FOR MEN ANY MORE THAN GOOD FOOD IS FOR MEN BREATHING AIR IS FOR MEN OR COMFORTABLE BEDS ARE FOR MEN
THIS LIST IS FUCKING MORONIC NONE OF THE BOOKS ARE INHERENTLY BAD IT'S JUST A GREATEST HITS OF BOOKS PLUS A COUPLE THAT WERE MADE INTO TIMELESS MOVIES


THIS IS A LIST A COLLEGE FRESHMAN WOULD PUT TOGETHER



SHOGUN SHOULD BE THERE
FOR SOME REASON THE IDEA OF TRYING TO BE A MAN IS CRINGE TO ME WHY DOES IT MATTER IF I'M MANLY CAN'T I JUST BE MYSELF
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN DOING SOMETHING WHEN THE PRIMARY REASON FOR DOING IT IS BECAUSE IT'S MANLY OR IT WILL MAKE YOU MORE OF A MANUAL KISS MY ASS CHOPPING WOOD DOESN'T MAKE ME MANLY IF I LIVE IN A CITY YOU KNOW WHAT'S MANLY TAKING CARE OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THAT'S ALL
EDUCATION OF A WANDERING MAN IS THE BOOK THAT TAUGHT ME THAT I NEEDED TO BE READING IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT THE BOOK WAS ABOUT OR WHO WROTE IT IT COULD TEACH ME SOMETHING
I'M PLEASED TO SEE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ON HERE WHAT ARE MEN TO ROCKS AND MOUNTAINS ETC
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS LIST CONTAINS INTERESTING FICTION TO READ THOUGHT PROVOKING BOOKS AND ANOTHER OF IT IS DISMISSIVE BULLSHIT THAT TENDS TO HAVE A LIBERTARIAN LEAN

I WOULD RECOMMEND ABOUT OF THOSE BOOKS NONE OF WHICH ARE FROM THE LAST CATEGORY
REMOVED
BOOKS EVERY WHITE AMERICAN MAN SHOULD READ IF THEY WANT TO FIT IN WITH THE BROS WHO DRINK RED BULL AND VODKA BUT THINK THEY'RE REALLY INTERESTING

THAT'S A BETTER TITLE

WAS THIS THE SAME SITE THAT HAD A LIST OF ALBUMS EVERY MAN SHOULD READ THAT WAS BASICALLY ROLLING STONES TOP LIST BUT ONLY EVERY 4TH ALBUM CHOSEN
I'M SO WEARILY TIRED OF ALL THIS DO THESE THINGS TO BE A MAN AS IF MY MASCULINITY SHOULD BE QUESTIONED BECAUSE MY BOOK SHELVES DON'T HOLD THE PROPER COLLECTION OF POORLY CONSTRUCTED SENTENCES

THERE ARE SOME DECENT BOOK CHOICES ON THIS LIST BUT TO SUGGEST THAT ANY ONE OF THEM OR EVEN ALL OF THEM TOGETHER MAKES ONE A BETTER MAN IS ABSURDITY AT ITS BEST


CAN WE JUST BREAK THIS LIST DOWN TO WHAT IT REALLY IS

IF YOU'RE AN ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT READ THESE BOOKS

IF YOU ENJOY CONTEMPLATING THE NATURE OF HUMANITY READ THESE BOOKS

IF YOU ENJOY READING ABOUT FOLKS WHO HAVE COME BEFORE YOU TO SEE HOW THEY HANDLED THE CHALLENGES OF LIFE READ THESE BOOKS

IF YOU WANT TO HAVE DEEP TIDBITS OF CONVERSATIONAL PROSE TO THROW AROUND AT SWANKY BUT ULTIMATELY SHALLOW PARTIES READ THESE BOOKS
I WONDER IF THE COMMENTS WOULD BE SO VITRIOLIC IF THIS WERE A LIST FROM BOOK CLUB THAT EVERY WOMAN SHOULD READ THE IDEA THAT A WEBSITE CATERING TO MEN IS SOMEHOW SHALLOW AND UNWORTHY OF CRITICISM IS BACKWARDS THINKING AT ITS BEST THE IRONY OF SMALL MINDEDNESS WEIGHS HEAVY IF THIS ARTICLE IS REINFORCING STEREOTYPES THEN OFFER EVIDENCE

SO FAR THE ONLY LEGIT CRITICISM I'VE SEEN IS THAT YOU CAN'T VIEW IT WITH AD BLOCK ON
I CANNOT THINK OF ANYTHING LESS MANLY THAN LOOKING UP INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO BE MANLY
TL R MADE OWN LIST FOR FUNNIES

I AGREE WITH THE GENERAL CONCEPT THAT THIS LIST IS CRAP GOOD BOOKS ARE GOOD AND EVERYONE SHOULD READ THEM EVERYONE SHOULD READ WHAT THEY LIKE WITHOUT FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE TO BE JUDGED FOR IT READING ANYTHING AT ALL IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY MORE BENEFICIAL THAN READING NOTHING REGARDLESS OF THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE MATERIAL AND SO FORTH

HOWEVER SOMETIMES A RUBRIC IS FUN TO INDULGE AS A THINKING EXERCISE AND THE PART OF ME THAT LIKES TO PLAY PRETEND WANTS TO GO ALONG WITH WHAT THE ARTICLE IS TRYING TO DO THEY SAY THAT IT'S JUST BASICALLY FOR ROUNDING OUT THE GENERAL CHARACTER AN ADMIRABLE GOAL BUT SORT OF FOR A MEN'S ADVERTISING PORTAL BLOG

HONESTLY POINTING OUT BOOKS FOR A READER TO SIFT THROUGH IS LIKE LAZILY GESTURING AT THE CLASSICS SECTION OF THE LIBRARY AND SAYING THERE YA GO GLAD WE COULD HELP ANYONE WHO GOES THROUGH THE FIRST TEN OR SO WILL PROBABLY REALIZE HE CAN GUESS MOST OF WHAT'S ON THE LIST BASED ON REQUIRED READING FROM LITERATURE COURSES IT WOULD BE MUCH HARDER AND PROMPT MORE DISCUSSION TO TRY TO NARROW IT DOWN TO TEN OR FEWER BOOKS THAT MEN OR ANYBODY REALLY SHOULD INCORPORATE INTO THEIR BRAIN SPACE

SO DO DATIVE FOR FUNNIES

NO PARTICULAR ORDER OR VALUE TO THIS LIST I'M JUST GOING TO LIST THE BOOKS THAT I FELT INFLUENCED MY CHARACTER THE MOST AND WOULD MOST LIKELY POSITIVELY IMPACT OTHER READERS

SOCRATIC DIALOGUES OF PLATO ANY COLLECTION TEACHES ONE TO THINK SIMPLY YET CRITICALLY AND NOT TO TAKE LIFE TOO SERIOUSLY

2 MEDITATIONS BY MARCUS AURELIUS FOR WHEN LIFE INEVITABLY GETS TOO SERIOUS TO LAUGH OFF

BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL BY NIETZSCHE CHALLENGES TO FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS PREVIOUSLY TAKEN FOR GRANTED

MACBETH TWELFTH NIGHT OR MUCH ADO BOUT NOTHING BY SHAKESPEARE CHOICE NO REALLY POPULAR FOR A REASON HE'S FUNNY TOUCHING AND BRILLIANT AND IS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN YOUR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER MADE HIM OUT TO BE

THE RISE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT BY EDMUND MORRIS A RIVETING BIOGRAPHY ABOUT THE EARLY LIFE OF THE MOST AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO EVER LIVED DOCUMENTING THE TIMES HE SPENT AS BATMAN WOLVERINE AND JOHN WAYNE READ THE BOOK IF YOU THINK I'M JOKING

INFERNO BY DANTE YOU CAN'T NOT READ IT BUT YOU CAN SKIP THE SEQUELS

CANDIDE BY VOLTAIRE IF PLATO DIDN'T WORK FOR YOU PERHAPS A ROLLICKING ADVENTURE TALE WILL HELP TO TEACH CRITICAL THINKING AND NOT TAKING LIFE TOO SERIOUSLY

NEUROSIS AND HUMAN GROWTH BY KAREN HORNEY IF YOU THINK YOU'RE A SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE WHO NO ONE UNDERSTANDS THIS BOOK WILL KICK THE EMO RIGHT OUT OF YOU

THE FLOWERS OF EVIL BY BAUDELAIRE A BEAUTIFUL LOOK AT THE SOMETIMES UGLY SIDE OF LIFE AND THE VIRTUE OF VICES

DROLL STORIES BY BALZAC SOMETHING IN THIS LIST HAD TO BE FUN

I'M SURE I'D GIVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LIST TOMORROW BUT THESE BOOKS HAVE ALL HELPED SHAPE MY ETHICS AND MY GENERAL ATTITUDES YOU CAN CALL BULLSHIT ON ANY ONE YOU LIKE A LIST OF ONLY TEN IS HARD BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S VALUE IN THESE THAT ANYONE IN ANY STATION OF LIFE CAN TAKE FROM THEM
I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE A BUNCH OF FEMINIST TEXTS OR AT LEAST SOME WRITTEN BY WOMEN AND POC WHICH MIGHT HELP MEN REFLECT ON SOME THINGS AND BE BETTER MEN INSTEAD IT'S BASICALLY CAPITALIST GREATEST HITS
SO BASICALLY THE CANON OF WHITE MALE LITERATURE THERE IS NOTHING ENTICING HERE THIS LIST IS NOT IMPRESSIVE THIS IS SO ELITIST AND LIMITING I'M SO TIRED OF BS LIKE THIS
WHILE I DO BELIEVE PLENTY OF THE CHOICES ON THE LIST ARE GREAT READS I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE SOME SORT OF PROJECTION IT HAS ON BEING A MANUAL THIS MAY EITHER BE GOOD OR BAD BUT IN THIS CASE IT DOES FEEL A BIT DATED

ONE DOES NOT NEED TO BE A RUGGED INDIVIDUAL TO ACHIEVE MANLINESS PERHAPS THIS LIST IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR JUNIOR SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL OR FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE WITH SOME MORE FEMININE LITERATURE LESS THE COMPILER OF THIS LIST IS TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR SOMETHING PERSONALLY I WOULD THROW IN RED AZALEA AND THE BLUEST EYES WE DON'T LIVE IN A VACUUM AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND OTHERS IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING THAT BEING SAID THE NARRATIVE OF BEING A BETTER MAN IS RATHER LIMITING BUT SO LONG AS PEOPLE ARE READING MORE I GUESS

I ALSO QUESTION THE INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION THIS LIST IS SUPPOSE TO HAVE IF ANY YOU CAN'T RECOMMEND ATLAS SHRUGGED AND WEALTH OF NATIONS WITHOUT STEPPING INTO SOME SORT OF ECHO CHAMBER WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH ARMCHAIRS IN THIS WORLD WHY DOESN'T THE LIST RECOMMENDED SOMETHING LIKE KARL COMMUNIST MANIFESTO OR SOMETHING MORE CONTROVERSIAL LIKE MEIN KEMPHF MISSPELLING IT SEES NO PROBLEM WITH RECOMMENDING THE ART OF WAR OR SOME BOOK ON HOW TO BE A BETTER MAN I MEAN IT EXPLICITLY RECOMMENDED THE 1ST EDITION OF THE BOYS SCOUTS MANUAL DESPITE IT BEING SEVERELY DATED TO DEMONSTRATE IT IS INCREDIBLY AND VEILED THINLY BY THEIR BRAND OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH MAKES ME SERIOUSLY QUESTION THE ARTICLES ULTERIOR MOTIVES AND THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY BOOKS ON SELF WHICH TO ME COMES OFF AS VERY NARCISSIST

HONESTLY MOST OF THESE BOOKS SOUND LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL READING LIST WHICH THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT BUT JUST BECAUSE I HAVE A SET OF TESTICLES BETWEEN MY LEGS SHOULDN'T MEAN I SHOULD BE RECOMMENDED TO READ THESE BOOKS OVER OTHER BETTER AND MORE STIMULATING CONTENTION




NO FAULKNER THIS LIST IS COMPLETE SHIT
GOOD LIST
THESE BOOKS ARE FOR MEN ONLY WOMEN STAND BACK
AM IS ALWAYS SUCH A TREATISE
VERY RIGHT LEANING RECOMMENDATIONS RUBBISH
THIS NEW OBSESSION WITH REVIVING SOME ANTIQUATED DEFINITION OF MANLINESS BEARDS AND PRETENDING TO BE A LUMBERJACK IS PRETTY CRINGEWORTHY ALSO THERE SHOULD BE LIKE AT LEAST MORE FEMALE AUTHORS ON THAT LIST
WHY DOESN'T DON DELILLO END UP ON THESE LISTS WHITE NOISE WAS AND INCREDIBLY MANLY BOOK AND SO IS UNDERWORLD ALSO BUCKMINSTER CRITICAL PATH IS EXTREMELY MANLY
THANKS
OOH LOOK AT THE NICE ROUND NUMBER IT'S LIKE TEN SETS OF TEN BOOKS I'VE READ QUITE A FEW OF THESE I WOULD THROW IN BRIEF INTERVIEWS WITH HIDEOUS MEN GOOD BOOK FOR BEING A
IS THAT BLOG THE RESULT OF THIS QUESTION DAYS AGO
R ACKMEN COMMENTS
EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X

MALCOLM X WAS LITERALLY TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE THERE WAS THE MALCOLM THAT WAS A RACIST TERRORIST BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY AND THE MALCOLM THAT WAS ENLIGHTENED ABOUT THE FAULTS OF HIS LIFE

FAR TOO OFTEN THE PEOPLE IN SOCIETY ONLY KNOW ABOUT THE FIRST MALCOLM BUT THE SECOND AFTER HIS PILGRIMAGE WAS THE PERSON THEY NEED TO BE EMULATING
GOOD LINK THANKS
BOOKS THE BLOG OWNER WOULD LIKE AN AMAZON REFERRAL COMMISSION FOR
IS THERE A LIST THAT ANYBODY CAN RECOMMEND THAT WOULD MAKE ME MORE OF A WELL ROUNDED INDIVIDUAL
I FEEL LIKE CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IS WAY MORE OF A MANLY BOOK THAN BROTHERS KARAMAZOV THE LATTER IS CONCERNED WITH MORE UNIVERSAL PHILOSOPHIES WHILE THE FORMER IS LITERALLY A CRITIQUE OF THE UBERMENSCH MINDSET SHAME ON YOU ART OF MANLINESS
I GUESS IT'S TIME TO READ
UNVOTE FOR THE SUN ALSO RISES
I CAN'T READ BOOKS
HAM ON BUKOWSKI


I IMAGINE SOME POOR SCHLUMP READING THE LIST SAYING TO HIMSELF OH YEAH LES MIS I LIKED THAT MOVIE AND START READING LES MISERABLES THERE'S NOT ONE MAN IN A MILLION WHO CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THAT DIGRESSION HELL THOUGH THAT ONE MAN WILL BE SATISFIED

EDIT TRIED READING LES MISERABLES BUT DIDN'T MAKE IT
TERRIFIC
NEAL CRYPTONOMICON SHOULD BE ON THIS LIST
COMMENT TO REMEMBER
SEEMS MOSTLY LIKE A LIST OF CLASSIC BOOKS NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT BUT I WOULD EXPECT MORE WILDERNESS PIONEER TALES AND MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE STEVE MEAT EATER ADVENTURES FROM THE LIFE OF AN AMERICAN HUNTER FOR EXAMPLE BASED ON THE TITLE OF THIS POST
FUCK WALDEN I WILL NEVER NOT HATE THAT BOOK
BESIDE THE POINT BUT WHEN THE BLOG FIRST BEGAN I COULDN'T TELL IF IT WAS SINCERE OR SATIRE I LISTENED TO THE PODCAST FOR A WHILE TOO BUT THEN EVERY EPISODE SEEMED TO BE ABOUT BEING IN THE MILITARY WHILE THAT'S FINE IT JUST WASN'T WHAT I WANTED TO WASTE TIME ON
ANY WW2 BOOK BY STEPHEN AMBROSE BAND OF BROTHERS IS AMAZING HE CAN MAKE EVEN THE MOST MUNDANE ASPECT OF HISTORY INTRIGUING
THE ROAD IS A GREAT BOOK AND ALL BUT I THINK IF THE FOCUS OF THE LIST IS ON BUILDING CHARACTER AND INDEPENDENCE ANY OF THE BORDER TRILOGY BOOKS WOULD BE MORE APPLICABLE OR BETTER YET ALL THREE
ARNOLD NEW ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MODERN BODYBUILDING SHOULD BE INCLUDED TOO
LEAVING OUT THE GUIDE TO THE GALAXY BY DOUGLAS ADAMS SEEMS TO BE A GLARING OMISSION
NO DUNE NO GAME THE INCLUSION OF MOBY DICK NOT THE MOST INSPIRING LIST TO FOLLOW
I'VE READ ABOUT OF THE LIST AND MOST ARE DECENT SOME NOT SO GREAT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE LIVE FOR MOBY DICK HOWEVER
SWEET I'VE ALREADY KNOCKED OF FROM THIS LIST GOOD TO KNOW
AYN RAND THOUGH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
DON'T THINK IRON JON IS ON THE LIST BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ EVERY MAN MUST READ THIS BOOK
I WOULD ADD ONE TO YOUR LIST BRETT MCKAY WAITERSHIP DOWN

GLENN SPRINKLE
NO PUGILIST AT REST BY THOM JONES HIGHSCHOOL LIST IS HIGHSCHOOL
IF I COULD ADD ONE I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND PILLARS OF WISDOM BY TENSE E LAWRENCE
STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND NEEDS TO BE ON THIS LIST
I THINK IT'S MISSING SOME DEBRETTS MAYBE THE ENGLISH GENTLEMAN SERIES
SO THEY JUST COPIED THE HIGH SCHOOL SUMMER READING LIST THEN COOL I GUESS

A FEW OF THOSE BOOKS ARE GOOD MOST OF THEM ARE NOTHING SPECIAL
TENSE EAST LAWRENCE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM
NOTABLY MISSING IS FREDERICK AUTOBIOGRAPHY I THINK I LEARNED MORE ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A MAN FROM THAT BOOK THAN FROM ANY OTHER SOURCE
TO SUM IT UP PRETTY MUCH EVERY BOOK THE AUTHOR OF THIS LIST HAD TO READ THROUGHOUT HIS LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION
AND TO TOP IT OFF THEY OMITTED SIDDHARTHA BY HERMAN HESSE AND PUT STEPPENWOLF ON THE LIST INSTEAD GUESSING HE REALLY LIKED MAGIC CARPET RIDE
NOT ALL OF THESE BUT MAYBE HALF OR SO SEEM LIKE ASSIGNMENTS I FIGURED IT WOULD BE A LIST OF BOOKS THAT MEN WOULD READING SINCE IT SEEMS MEN DO NOT READ IN THE NUMBERS THAT WOMEN DO RATHER THAN FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES IN THAT REGARD I'M NOT SURE WHAT MAKES THE LIST EXCLUSIVE TO MEN I EAST WOMEN CAN ALSO BENEFIT FROM ACQUIRING MANLY VIRTUES IF THAT'S THE POINT

AS FAR AS BOOKS THAT MEN WOULD I'D BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT LIST I WOULD INCLUDE ON IT ANYTHING BY STEPHEN KING THE JAMES BOND NOVELS ANYTHING BY DONALD EAST WESTLAKE OR HIS MANY PSEUDONYMS THE JACK REACHER SERIES AND ROBERT EAST ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES
THIS LIST IS ORIENTED TOWARDS THE CLASSICS AND I'M NOT SURE WHY MEN SHOULD READ THEM I CAN HOWEVER THINK OF SEVERAL BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE ON A LIST FOR MEN

A BOOK OF FIVE RINGS THE POWER OF ONE THE FOUR FEATHERS IVANHOE PROFILES IN COURAGE TRUE GRIT


I HAVE HAD THAT PAGE BOOKMARKER FOR LAST FOUR YEARS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY JUST UPDATED THE LIST TODAY
NO JIM HARRISON
I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD THE JUNGLE BETTER BE ON THIS LIST
SINCE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE APPARENTLY BELONGS ON THAT LIST I REALLY FAIL TO SEE WHAT WOULD NOT BELONG ON THAT LIST
SURPRISED HAM ON RYE BY CHARLES BUKOWSKI ISN'T ON THE LIST
AND I READ 2 OF THOSE THE GODFATHER AND BAND OF BROTHERS I'M PUTTING A FEW OF THEM ON MY TO READ LIST
WHERE IS THE ALPHABET OF MANLINESS ON THE LIST
FOR THE COUNT OF MONTE ENGLISH TRANSLATION SHOULD I READ
NO G KING CHESTERTON YOUR LIST IS INVALID
TAKE OUT THE WEALTH OF NATIONS AND PUT IN THE CATCHER AND THE RYE
AYN RAND BUT NO JONATHAN SWIFT FAIL
I HATE THESE LISTS BECAUSE IT INEVITABLY JUST DEVOLVES INTO HERE IS A LIST OF CLASSICS YOU SHOULD READ AND ALSO A LOT OF BOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN DEEMED HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT BUT THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T READ UNLESS ASSIGNED THEM IN SCHOOL

THERE'S A REASON PEOPLE DON'T PICK UP WEALTH OF NATIONS TO READ NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT IMPORTANT OR INFLUENTIAL BUT BECAUSE I'M NOT READING THAT DENSE SHIT WHEN A LOT OF US HAVE TO PUT UP WITH DENSE OR BORING STUFF AT LEAST HOURS A DAY
BY A QUICK SCROLL I THINK IT'S A NICE LIST IF YOU NEED A GENDERED READING RECOMMENDATION GO FOR IT AS A GIRL I'VE READ LOTS OF THESE GOOD BOOKS ARE GOOD BOOKS

I'VE READ AT LEAST ONCE AND STARTED OR DABBLED IN OF THE OTHERS
GREAT LIST THANKS FOR POSTING
WHAT EXACTLY SHOULD I BE EXPECTING UPON COMPLETING THIS LIST
I'M HONESTLY SURPRISED THAT TWO HEMINGWAY TITLES MADE IT TO THIS MANLY LIST AND NEITHER WERE THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA WE ALL KNOW THAT HEMINGWAY DEALT THEMATICALLY WITH MASCULINITY IN HIS WORKS BUT THIS TITLE IN PARTICULAR SEEMS TO HAVE A PROFOUND FOCUS ON THE ELEMENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MORTAL MAN NATURE
ALL LISTS SHOULD BE DONE ON GOODREADS BECAUSE I'M LAZY AND WANT TO JUST CLICK TO READ ON LISTS OR MAKE SURE I READ BOOKS
MY ENGLISH TEACHER IN EIGHTH GRADE THIS LIST IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE I'M NOT THAT YOUNG CHALLENGED OUR CLASS TO READ AS MANY BOOKS OFF THIS LIST AS POSSIBLE OVER THE YEAR WITH A PRIZE GOING TO THE WINNER

I ENDED UP GETTING HUNG UP ON CRIME AND PUNISHMENT FOR WAY TOO LONG AND WASTING A LOT OF TIME NOT THAT IT WASN'T WORTH THE READ OF COURSE AND CAME IN SECOND BEHIND A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE

IT WAS DEFINITELY A REALLY GREAT IDEA AND AT LEAST A FEW OF US WHO TOOK THE CHALLENGE SERIOUSLY HAD A LOT OF FUN READING MANY OF THESE BOOKS LOOKING BACK ON IT I THINK IT'S A GOOD LIST AND A LOT OF THE BOOKS ON IT ARE MUST READS WHETHER YOU'RE A MAN OR A WOMAN IMO
I AM BLOWN AWAY THAT ROBERT IRON JOHN IS NOT MENTIONED HERE
I READ THIS AS LIST OF BOOKS EVERYMAN SHOULD READ I'M THINKING WHAT AWESOME POWERS IS HE GOING TO GET FROM THESE OH UM BROODINESS
I HAVEN'T READ ANY OF THESE PAPERS I DO READ BUT NEVER DID ONE OF THOSE BOOKS
I HAVE READ ABOUT OF THESE
WHY THE BIBLE BUT NO TEXTS FROM OTHER RELIGIONS UNLESS I'M MISSING SOMETHING THE BHAGAVAD-GITA THE KORAN ETC
THEODORE REX WAS AWESOME DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS PART OF A TRILOGY
WEALTH OF NATIONS IS REALLY HARD TO READ
THIS LIST IS MORE OR LESS A SPAN OF THE CURRICULUM OF ENGLISH CLASSES FROM HIGH SCHOOL THROUGH COLLEGE I'VE READ OF THE BOOKS ON THE LIST AND BASED ON MY MEMORY OF THOSE WERE REQUIRED READING FOR SCHOOL SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY UNINSPIRED LIST THAT FOCUSES ON MAKING SURE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN CLAIM HE OR SHE IS WELL READ
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE FUCK THAT
I'D THROW IN NECROMANCER WILLIAM GIBSON THE BEGINNING OF THE SPRAWL TRILOGY
FAIL I DON'T SEE JEFF COOPER ON THAT LIST NAMELY TO RIDE SHOOT STRAIGHT AND SPEAK THE TRUTH AND ART OF THE RIFLE
I WAS HAPPY TO SEE SOME GOOD EXISTENTIALIST READING KIERKEGAARD NIETZSCHE AND CAMUS THOUGH FOR NIETZSCHE I WOULD OF WENT WITH GENEALOGY OF MORALS IT IS DEFINITELY HARD TO MAKE A MUST READ LIST BUT THIS LIST IS VERY GOOD
IT SHOULD BE A CRIME TO LEAVE CATCHER IN THE EYE OFF THIS LIST
I'LL WAIT FOR THE MOVIES
DOES THIS WORK FOR BOYS TOO
HEARTBREAKINGLY I HAVE READ ONE AND A QUARTER OF THESE I READ THE HOBBIT BUT LORD OF THE RINGS WAS JUST SO DRY AND OVERLY DESCRIPTIVE I FIND MYSELF STRUGGLING TO GET PAST EVEN THE COUNCIL OF ELROD EVERY TIME

TIME WAS I COULD DEVOUR A BOOK A DAY ADMITTEDLY MOSTLY PRITCHETT GEMMELL EDDINGS EASILY STARTED NIGH IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT DOWN RARELY OVERLY LONG AND SNAPPY WHILE STILL ABLE TO IMPART KNOWLEDGE AND LIFE LESSONS THAT BETTER TEACH YOU TO BE A WORTHY PERSON

STILL I HAVE A LOT TO CATCH UP ON
THE FIRST STEP ON THE ROAD TO MANLINESS IS REALIZING THAT THE ENTIRE CONCEPT IS STUPID AND YOU SHOULD DO YOUR OWN THING NOT WHAT SOME HIPSTER BLOG TELLS YOU TO

FIND A BOOK ON THAT AND YOU'RE GOLDEN
READ THESE YOU
SO PICK A TOP
MOST OF THESE BOOKS SHOULD JUST BE READ BY EVERYBODY I DON'T SEE WHY THEY'RE SO PARTICULAR TO MEN
I THINK CRITICAL PATH BY BUCKMINSTER FULLER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THAT LIST ALSO GODEL ESCHER BACH THOSE ARE SOME MANLY MAN BOOKS IF I'VE EVER READ ONE
DID I SERIOUSLY JUST READ AN ENTIRE TOP LIST OF BOOKS EVERY MAN SHOULD READ AND NOT SEE TRUE GRIT
EH THE WHOLE GENDER ROLE THING IS A BIT OLD FASHIONED
HATCHET WAS THE FIRST BOOK I EVER READ GOT ME INTO THE OUTDOORS AND PROBABLY CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER
CAN SOMEONE NARROW THIS DOWN TO THE TOP K THX
ART OF MANLINESS IS A FANTASTIC BLOG I PARTICULARLY RECOMMEND THE ARTICLES ON PREPARING BACON AND MOVING IN A MANNER REMINISCENT OF A NINJA
OK IN THE FIRST YEARS I HAVE OF THOSE BOOKS DOWN
TOO MUCH FICTION NOT ENOUGH DIVERSITY BUT IT'S A GOOD START I SEE NO NEED TO TAPE TO ANY DOOR ANY THING IS GOOD I GUESS IF IT GETS MORE PEOPLE READING
MANLINESS IS AN OUTDATED CONCEPT
I'M SURPRISED ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE WAS ON HERE IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDEST BOOKS I'VE READ BUT DAMN WAS IT AMAZING LOVE GARCIA MARQUEZ
HOPE I'M NOT LATE TO THE PARTY JUST A HEADS UP THERE'S BOOKS ON THIS LIST THAT ARE FREE ON AMAZON WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD IT TO THE KINDLE APP

FOUND THREE ALREADY
THE PRINCE
PLUTARCH
THE ART OF WAR

FOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO READ ONE OR TWO YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK ON AMAZON FIRST AND SEE IF YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT ONTO YOUR KINDLE APP IT'LL SAVE YOU A COUPLE OF BUCKS

HOPE IT HELPS PEOPLE WANTING TO READ AND SAVE MONEY
COMMENTING TO COME BACK
THE ONLY THING MISSING WAS INFINITE JEST WHAT A TERRIBLE LIST
I REJECT THE ENTIRE IDEA BEHIND THAT HEADLINE

LET'S NOT MAKE IT SHOULD
THIS IS A NICE LIST BUT I'M AGAINST THE WHOLE CONCEPT BEHIND IT I AM A MAN AND I LIKE THESE BOOKS AND EVERY MAN SHOULD READ THEM IT'D BE A LOT NICER IF EVERY MAN AND WOMAN READ DIFFERENT BOOKS IT WOULD MAKE THE WORLD A MORE INTERESTING PLACE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO READ ASK SOMEONE YOU OFTEN DISAGREE WITH TRY ONE BY A YOUNG AUTHOR PICK UP A BOOK BY A LOCAL AUTHOR WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELLING ABROAD OR JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICK UP A RANDOM ONE AT THE BOOK STORE
A MAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ AND IT WOULD BE NICE IF AN AVERAGE HUMAN READ BOOKS A YEAR
IF YOU'RE GOING TO INCLUDE SO MANY BOOKS THAT ARE GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDLESS OF GENDER YOU SHOULD PROBABLY INCLUDE NIGHT BY ELIE WIESEL IT CAN BE READ IN AN AFTERNOON AS FAR AS LENGTH IS CONCERNED IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO READ ALL AT ONCE FOR OTHER REASONS AND IS THE ONLY BOOK I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD READ
TOO LATE FOR THE DISCUSSION BUT I'LL ADD IRON JOHN A BOOK ABOUT MEN BY AMERICAN POET ROBERT BLY IT TALKS ABOUT HOW BOYS BECOME MEN IN SOCIETIES OTHER THEN OURS AND HOW WE ARE MISSING THAT CLEAR TRANSITION OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN OUR CULTURE
PRETTY SURPRISED TO SEE I'VE READ A GOOD CHUNK OF THESE BOOKS SOME GOOD AND SOME BAD ON THAT LIST AYN RAND AND THE BIBLE SEEMED UNNECESSARY
THE KILLER ANGELS WAS PRETTY AMAZING I'D PUT COUNTY SOUTH FORESTER IN THE LIST FOR HORNBLOWER THOUGH
MOST OF THESE ARE TAKEN OFF REQUIRED READING LISTS FROM ABOUT 5TH GRADE TO FRESHMEN COLLEGE

WHERE IS THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK
EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES
ANNA KARENINA
SILENT SPRING
THE RISE FALL OF THE THIRD REICH

HISTORY
TAKE THE BIBLE OUT AND ADD THE MANIFESTO BY MARX ENGELS AND WE'RE GUCCI
THE RIVER WHY I THINK SHOULD BE ON THIS LIST
A LOT OF GOOD BOOKS IN THERE BUT THEY ARE ALL GENERALLY GOOD BOOKS AND SHOULD BE ROAD BY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN


I'VE ONLY READ FIFTY-SIX OF THEM BUT I'M NOT A GUY SO
IT'S ONE OF THE BETTER LISTS I'VE SEEN I GUESS WAS HONESTLY SURPRISED TO NOT SEE THE AENEID ON THERE THE WHOLE DUTIFUL AENEAS THING SEEMED LIKE WHAT THEY WERE AIMING FOR AFTER ALL

SEEMED PRETTY HEAVILY BIASED TOWARDS OLDER AMERICAN LITERATURE AND WAR NOVELS I CAN GET BAND OF BROTHERS AND ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT AND THE CHURCHILL TRILOGY BUT IT SEEMED SOMEWHAT MYOPIC HONESTLY

I WOULD HAVE REPLACED SEVERAL OF THE BOOKS WITH THE AENEID WITH DUTIFUL AENEAS AND SACRIFICING WHAT YOU MAY WANT TO DO FOR WHAT YOU ARE CALLED TO DO BY DUTY OR THE DIVINE OR WHAT HAVE YOU ROMANCE OF THREE KINGDOMS FOR THE BROTHERHOOD OF LIU BAI GUAN YU AND ZHANG FEI THE TALE OF BENJI FOR THE ROMANTIC EXPLOITS OF THE SHINING PRINCE AND HOW DIFFERENT ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR FOR MEN VARIES ACROSS TIME AND CULTURES THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH FOR THE LEGENDARY FRIENDSHIP OF GILGAMESH AND ENKIDU AND A CAUTIONARY TALE OF VAINGLORY AND RECKLESSNESS AND WHAT IT CAN COST AND HONESTLY I WOULD SPECIFICALLY REPLACE THE BIBLE WITH CONFESSIONS THE BIBLE IS RATHER MORE AN ANTHOLOGY OF BOOKS WHICH DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK TO A SINGULAR PURPOSE WHILE AUGUSTINE IS MORE FOCUSED AND STILL QUITE THE CLASSICAL WORK OF THEOLOGY

OH AND THE THREE MUSKETEERS


TL R THIS LIST HITS A LOT OF GREAT TITLES THAT ARE OFTEN MISSING FROM THESE SUBJECTIVE LISTS THAT I APPROVE OF BUT THERE ISN'T A SINGLE WORK ON THE LIST AND AS USUAL FOR THIS PARTICULAR BLOG IT INSINUATES BEING A MAN IS PRETTY MUCH EQUIVALENT TO CONFORMING TO A VERY SPECIFIC STEREOTYPE
OR ANYTHING BY LOUIS
NOBODY EVER HAS TO READ AYN RAND EVER THERE IS NOT A SINGLE GOOD REASON TO WASTE YOUR TIME ON THAT BULLSHIT
I LITERALLY FINISHED READING SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO COULDN'T PUT THE DAMNED THING DOWN HIGHLY RECOMMEND
JOHN STEINBECK IS A GOOD ADDITION TO THIS LACK OF MANLINESS BLOG I WOULD ADD HIS EAST OF EDEN TOO
SO BASICALLY EVERY CLASSIC INCLUDING PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
I'LL TAKE CLASSICS BY MOSTLY DEAD WHITE MEN FOR ALEX

HOW ABOUT SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE HETERO NORMATIVE STEREOTYPES I SAY THAT AS A WHITE GUY WHO ENJOYED MANY OF THOSE NOVELS

THE IDEA OF OF THESE MUST READ LISTS IS OSTENSIBLY TO EXPAND HORIZONS ALLOW READERS TO EXPERIENCE VIEWPOINTS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THEM ETC NOT REINFORCE THE ALREADY ESTABLISHED SOCIAL NORMS

PS ATLAS SHRUGGED THE BIBLE SOMEONE IS HAVING A JOKE
DIDN'T NOTICE IT DID YOU INCLUDE REAL MEN DON'T EAT QUICHE
YOU LEFT OUT A CATCHER IN THE RYE YOU BIG PHONY
I'M CONFUSED WHY SHOULD I READ ALL THESE BOOKS AS A MAN
I HAVE READ EXACTLY NONE OF THOSE
LET'S AGREE TO DISAGREE ABOUT ATLAS SHRUGGED
I THINK LAWS OF POWER DESERVES A SPACE IN THE LIST
I THOUGHT THERE WAS ONLY THREE

LEARN TO RIDE LIKE A MAN BY JACK DAWSON

LEARN TO CHEW TOBACCO LIKE A MAN BY JACK DAWSON

LEARN TO SPIT LIKE A MAN BY JACK DAWSON
I'VE READ OVER HALF OF THEM AND THE ONE BOOK I'D DROP FROM THE LIST IS ATLAS SHRUGGED

IT'S NOT WORTH READING EVERYTHING IS SIGNALLED THE CHARACTERS ARE TWO DIMENSIONAL AND THE SUPPOSED PHILOSOPHICAL MESSAGE IS JUST PLAIN SELF INTEREST

A DULL PLANK OF A READ
THAT'S A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE LIST I CAN THINK OF A FEW I'D LIKE TO ADDENDUM THE PROBLEM IS THAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'D REMOVE TO MAKE SPACE FOR THEM

FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH THESE ARE MY PROPOSED ADDITIONS

A LESSON BEFORE DYING ERNEST GAINES
THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND JULES VERNE
LORD JIM JOSEPH CONRAD
CHRONICLE OF A DEATH FORETOLD GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ
LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ
TESS OF THE THOMAS HARDY
THE WAY WE LIVE NOW ANTHONY TROLLOPE
VANITY FAIR WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY
GERMINAL EMILE ZOLA

KEN KASEY ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST
HERMAN HESS SIDDHARTHA
GOOD LIST THOUGH IM ALWAYS MILDLY SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THESE LISTS WHEN YOU SEE THINGS LIKE ULYSSES AND THE BIBLE OR PARADISE LOST ON THEM ALL GOOD BOOKS SURE BUT DOES IT FIT INTO A MUST READ LIST IF YOU DONT LOVE LITERATURE YOU PROBABLY WONT LIKE THOSE THREE OR ANYTHING LIKE THEM

ALSO IT DOES RATHER SMACK OF THE AUTHOR RUNNING OUT OF BOOKS THAT THEY KNOW PEOPLE SHOULD READ AND JUST PICKING A FEW WIDELY KNOWN ONES

EDIT LEVIATHAN IS ON THERE GUYS AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT ITS WRITTEN IN THAT WHEREFORE FORSOOTH IT CAN BE CONSIDERED BY THE GRACE OF THE KING LORD OF THE NATION APPOINTED BY GOD HAND OF THE MOST HIGH BLAH BLAH BLAH STYLE JUST READ A SYNOPSIS YOU WILL BE FINE

I SHOULD SAY THAT I HAVE READ IT SO THIS ISNT JUST PHILISTINISM SPEAKING
BUT IF YOU'RE A WOMAN DON'T YOU DARE
SO WHAT HAPPENS ONCE YOU FINISH READING THEM ALL YOU DIE OR FINALLY CAN GO TO THE GYM OR REALIZE HOW LITTLE OF A MAN YOU HAVE BEEN AND LIKELY TO REMAIN
NAME OF THE WEBSITE IS SO CRINGEWORTHY
I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS BOOKS YOUR POLITICAL SCIENCE AND ENGLISH LIT TEACHERS WANT YOU TO READ WITH BOOKS ADDED THAT SOUND MANLY
THIS BLOG IS COMPLETE GARBAGE

HOW ABOUT THIS DON'T TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO READ BUY OR DO IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AS ONE GENDER OR ANOTHER
JESUS THIS IS LIKE THE MOST MANCHILD BULLSHIT EVER I STOPPED READING AT THE PRINCE AMD JUST SCROLLED DOWN A WHILE TO LAUGH I BET YOU ANYTHING AYN RAND SHOWS UP LATER

PROTID IF ANY BUSINESS EVER TELLS YOU THIS IS WHAT A MAN NEEDS TO DO OR THIS IS WHAT A MAN NEEDS TO BUY JUST ROLL YOUR EYES AND KEEP BROWSING THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL YOU SHIT BY FUCKING WITH YOUR INSECURITIES

THIS LIST WAS COMPILED BY A MORON ANYWAY IT'S NOT THAT THE BOOKS ARE BAD THOUGH SOME OF THEM ARE IT'S JUST THAT EVERYONE'S READ THEM AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR MASCULINITY
NOT A BAD LIST WHICH MEANS I RECOGNIZE MOST TITLES AND HAVE ACTUALLY READ A FEW
NO DEAN KOONTZ FUCKINBULLSHIT
WOMEN STAY THE FUCK OUT OF THE THIS LIST
BOOKS EVERY MAN SHOULD READ TO CURE HIS INSOMNIA
YOU'D THINK THEY WOULD WANT TO INCLUDE MORE THAN BOOK CENTERED ON WOMEN I'M NOT TRYING TO BE PC HERE I THINK IT WOULD BE VALUABLE FOR MEN TO READ MORE NOVELS CENTERED AROUND WOMEN IN ORDER TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCE IS LIKE
I DO NOT GET THE POINT OF ALL THESE DAMN EVERY MAN SHOULD READ LISTS FIRST OF ALL ESQUIRE HAS ALREADY DONE THIS SHIT SO THESE OTHER LISTS JUST END UP BEING SUPER REPETITIVE

SECOND OF ALL WHY DO WE NEED LISTS GREAT BOOKS FOR MEN SHOULD BE GREAT BOOKS FOR WOMEN AS WELL BOTH GENDERS CAN LEARN A LOT FROM NOVELS FOCUSED ON THE OTHER THE ONLY TIME I CAN SEE THESE LISTS HAVING A POINT IS IF EVERY BOOK IS INCLUDED FOR A SPECIFIC REASON IN REGARDS TO UNDERSTANDING MASCULINITY OR FEMININITY BUT NONE OF THEM ACTUALLY DO THIS THEY JUST PICK BOOKS THAT THE AVERAGE DUDE WOULD BE INTO
THIS WILL DEFINITELY TRIGGER SOME REALLY WOKE COMMENTS

I CAN'T BELIEVE A MAN'S LIFE THE COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS BY DENIS BOYLES DIDN'T MAKE THAT LIST

IT'S LIKE AN MANUAL FOR A PENIS SAID ONE BRILLIANT GIRLFRIEND
HOW IS ART OF THE DEAL NOT ON THIS LIST
THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD LIST GLAD I'M AHEAD OF THE GAME ON MOST OF THESE
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING MANLY AND THAT'S IGNORING LISTS THAT TELL YOU DO THESE THINGS AND YOU WILL BECOME MORE MANLY

I REMEMBER THE GUYS THAT GREW UP TO BE MEN THEY SPENT THEIR CHILDHOODS OUTSIDE CAMPING ATES HUNTING FISHING GETTING IN FIGHTS DIRT BIKING SKIING BOATING CHASING GIRLS DRINKING BEER PLAYING HOCKEY AND EVERY OTHER SPORT THEY COULD WORKING AND HELPING OUT THEIR FATHERS CANT SAY THEY WERE DOING MUCH READING

EDIT I CAN SEE WHY THAT WOULD BE DOWNVOTED ON REDDIN SO SUBVERSIVE BUT THEN THESE ARE PEOPLE READING A BLOG ABOUT WHAT BOOKS TO READ TO BECOME MANLY LOL
THIS LIST BECAME GARBAGE AT THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA HANDBOOK 1ST EDITION 1ST EDITION REALLY HIPSTER MUCH AND THEN THE BIBLE THAT BOOK STRAIGHT GARBAGE
AROUND BOOKS EVERYONE SHOULD READ AND BOOKS WE'VE HEARD THAT IT IS SOPHISTICATED TO READ
MOST OF THESE ARE BOOKS ANYONE SHOULD READ NOT JUST MEN
SORTING THIS THREAD BY CONTROVERSIAL BRINGS ALL THE ANGRY TRIGGERED LIBERALS TO THE TOP
SOON TO BE RENAMED THE ART OF GENDER NEUTRAL SUCCESS DICKHEADS KNOW WHAT'S UP
THE ART OF WAR BY SUN TAU DISQUALIFIES THIS LIST AS BEING TRITE HIPSTER TRASH IMO WHO HERE IS A MILITARY LEADER VERY FEW
BOOKS EVERY MAN SHOULD READ BY THEARTOFMANLINESS

HAGAKURE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND HIGH SCHOOL READING LIST BOOKS

FUCK OFF CLICKBAIT
I'M PROBABLY OPENING A CAN OF WORMS BUT DOES ATLAS SHRUGGED HAVE ANY SERIOUS LITERARY MERIT IF YOU LOOK BEYOND THE POLITICAL MESSAGE IT CARRIES DOES THE BOOK CONTAIN WELL-WRITTEN PROSE AND CHARACTERS IS IT PLOTTED WELL DOES IT STANDUP ON ITS OWN WITHOUT THE BELIEF SYSTEM IT ESPOUSES AND HAS LED TO ITS CURRENT CULT OF SUPPORTERS

FULL DISCLOSURE I HAVE NEVER READ IT OR HAVE SEEN THE MOVIES BUT I'M PRETTY SURE I READ ITS WIKIPEDIA SUMMARY ONCE I WAS PROBABLY A BIT HIGH WHEN I DID IT

WEALTH OF NATIONS


ATLAS SHRUGGED


THE BIBLE


SELF-RELIANCE OTHER ESSAYS



THIS LIST STINKS OF RIGHT-WING AMERICAN LIBERTARIANISM TO BE HONEST
ITT GIRLY MEN COMPLAINING ABOUT A SITE DEVOTED TO REAL MEN
THE BIBLE IT'S ALMOST WE REALLY NEED TO LEAVE THIS BOOK OF BULLSHIT BEHIND
NOT SURE WHY THIS LIST IS JUST FOR MEN
SO BY AND LARGE IGNORE FEMALE PERSPECTIVES RIGHT GOT IT


THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO ME IN MY EARLY TWENTIES I ATTRIBUTED IT TO GROWING UP WITHOUT A FATHER FIGURE
WHAT A BIZARRE SELECTION OF BOOKS FROM THE SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS ETERNAL CLASSICS NEXT TO SELF-HELP BULLSHIT BOOKS WHICH NO NON-AMERICAN WOULD BE EVEN SLIGHTLY INTERESTED IN NEXT TO WEIRD RIGHT WING TRACTS GOD NUMBER
I THINK MEN SHOULD ACTIVELY READ BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT THE FEMALE EXPERIENCE READ SOMETHING THAT CHALLENGES THEIR OWN POV
WHAT THIS REALLY IS IS A LIST THAT ATTEMPTS TO CLAW BACK GENDER STEREOTYPES FROM THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS AND BRING THEM BACK INTO RELEVANCE

OBVIOUSLY MEN SHOULD BE RECLINING IN THEIR BRASS STUDDED LEATHER LOUNGE CHAIRS SMOKING A CIGAR AND LEISURELY READING ABOUT HOW GREAT IT IS TO BE A MAN WHILE THE WIFE IS SOMEWHERE PROBABLY COOKING OR CLEANING LIKE SHE'S SUPPOSED TO

NEXT UP LIST OF WOMANLY BOOKS EVERY LADY SHOULD READ

HOW TO GIVE BIRTH REPEATEDLY


COOKING AND CLEANING


BEING SILENT AND OBEYING


SANDWICHES FOR DUMMIES



I FEEL INSPIRED TO CHOP WOOD AND SUBJUGATE THE POOR
THE ART OF MANLINESS WHAT AN ANTIQUATED CONCEPT WHAT ARE YOU A TEDDY ROOSEVELT ACOLYTE JESUS
THIS IS SUCH A TYPICAL LIST OF DUSTY OLD CANNON STANDARDS WHILE THEY'RE NEARLY ALL UNDENIABLY IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL WORKS THEY JUST REITERATE THE SAME NOTIONS OF MANHOOD THAT HAVE DEFINED AND UPHELD THE PATRIARCHY FOR TOO LONG IT'S TIME TO START SUPPORTING FRESH IDEAS AND NEW PERSPECTIVES NOT JUST BANGING ON THE SAME OLD DRUMS FOREVER
BLUNTLY IF YOU SEEK ADVICE ON BEING MANLY YOU'VE ALREADY FAILED
ADAM SMITH AYN RAND AND NO MARX
HEAVILY BIASED IMHO
I STARTED READING YOUR LIST AND WHEN I SAW THE BIBLE I STOPPED
THE BIBLE NOPE
LOL BOOKS EVEN THE LIST OF TITLES OF BOOKS WAS WAY TOO LONG TO CONSIDER READING
THAT SITE GIVES ME DOUCHE CHILLS

OH AND THE BIBLE LOLLLLLLZ SO SOPHISTICATED
BOOKS EVERY MAN SHOULD READ BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE A MANLY MANLY MAN
TRY THIS ON BOOKS WRITTEN BY WOMEN DO I NEED TO READ ANOTHER BOOKS WRITTEN BY MEN WAS OUR ENTIRE HUMAN HISTORY NOT WRITTEN BY MEN

THE GREATEST PROGRESS A MAN CAN MAKE IN HIS LIFE IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS NOT INNATELY EXCEPTIONAL THAT HE MUST CHOOSE TO BE ESCAPE THE ECHO CHAMBER THERE IS NOTHING MORE MANLY THAN EMPATHIZING AND GOING TO BAT FOR THE DISENFRANCHISED
ANYTIME A SEE A LIST FOR MEN THESE DAYS IT'S ALWAYS SOME LIMP WRISTED RUSSIFIED NUMBLE BULLSHIT

THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD LIST KIND OF SURPRISED
WHAT HAPPENED TO READING FOR FUN I WANT A GOOD STORY AND MEMORABLE CHARACTERS I DON'T NEED POLITICAL COMMENTARY OR POIGNANT MESSAGES ON LIFE I JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN I DON'T HAVE TO ANALYZE EVERYTHING I READ OR TRY TO RELATE IT TO MY OWN LIFE OR THE SITUATIONS AROUND ME
THE BIBLE GTO WITH THAT SHIT
SURPRISED AT THE LIST NOT BEING TOTAL SHIT
PRETTY GOOD LIST FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHY THE SEXISM ANYONE CAN APPRECIATE THESE BOOKS
ALREADY READ IS THAT GOOD
TAKE PUT LORD OF THE FLIES AND YOU HAVE A GREAT LIST
ADDED THESE TO MY LIST
FROM GUIDES TO GAYS IS THE MANLIEST BOOK OF THE YEAR IT'S BRAND NEW ON AMAZON AND MANLY
I DIDN'T READ THE WHOLE LIST BUT CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME IF THE ART OF THE DEAL WAS ON THERE ITS THE BEST BOOK EVER BELIEVE ME IF YOU WANT TO BE A MAN THEN THIS IS THE ONLY BOOK YOU NEED TO READ MAGA
NO VAGINA MONOLOGUES
OKAY OKAY WE'RE CHECKING THE BOXES HERE CATCH BRAVE NEW WORLD TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD OK ALL THE BOOKS ON EVERY LIST EVER YES NOW LET'S GET INTO THE ALTUS SHRUGGED PHASE NOW MAYBE A LITTLE LOLITA AND FINALLY INTO THE FINAL PHASE LEVIATHAN ULYSSES ART OF WAR OK EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL

YEAH HAVE FUN WITH THAT LIST WEESH TAKE YOUR BEARD WAX TIGHT JEANS SCARF GET-UP PACK A COPY OF LEVIATHAN UNDER YOUR ARM AND WALK INTO THE OCEAN
REAL MEN DON'T READ BOOKS
WHY THE BIBLE WHAT A SHITTY IDEA I'VE READ THE OLD TESTAMENT ADDED ZERO VALUE TO MY LIFE ALSO NOTHING BY THE STOICS BUT PLENTY ON WAR AND SUFFERING
REMOVED
HOW DO I REMIND MYSELF OF THIS LIST IN A WEEK
ONLY ONE CORMAC BOOK ON HERE SCAM
I'VE READ AND HAVE SO I'VE READ OR AM PLANNING ON READING A GOOD PORTION OF THAT LIST

MAYBE I SHOULD MAKE MY OWN BECAUSE THIS ONE SUCKS
STARTING WITH GREAT GATSBY THE BOOK THAT WAS MADE INTO A CLASSIC LOST ME THERE
SERIOUSLY PLAYBOY ISN'T ON THE LIST OP IS A WOMAN
ATLAS SHRUGGED I THOUGHT THIS WAS A READING LIST FOR MEN NOT ADOLESCENTS
SO BASICALLY ANYTHING AS LONG AS IT'S WRITTEN BY A MANUAL
I'VE READ EXACTLY WHICH MAKES ME HALF A MAN
JUST IMAGINE HOW THE WORLD WOULD LOOK LIKE IF EVERY SINGLE MAN ON EARTH READ BOOKS
THIS LIST IS FUCKED THE RATIONAL MALE ISN'T ON HERE BUT THE BIBLE IS PLEASE
IF YOU NEED A WEBSITE TO TELL YOU HOW TO BE MANLY YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KICK YOUR DAD IN THE NUTS
THE FIRST BOOK IS THE GREAT GATSBY AUTOMATICALLY DISREGARDED THE REST OF THE LIST
I REALIZED THIS LIST WAS SHIT WHEN I SAW THE WEALTH OF NATIONS BUT NOTHING FROM MARX
TRIGGERED
SO THESE BOOKS HAVE SOME MANNER OF SECURITY DEVICE WHICH CAN ONLY BE OPENED WITH A PENIS OR DO THEY DETECT FEMALE HORMONES AND SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST
EVERY TIME I SEE A LIST TITLED BOOKS EVERY SHOULD READ I ROLL MY EYES
I FEEL GROSS FOR CLICKING ON THIS BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY GROSS BY THE CONTENT CAUSE BOOKLIFT



YOU CAN SKIP THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV
WHO KNEW THESE CLASSICS WERE ONLY FOR MEN HOPE I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TOO BUTCH READING MANY OF THESE BOOKS AS A WOMAN
IF ANYTHING THE NAME OF THE WIND BY PAT ROTHFUSS SHOULD BE HERE
THEY SHOULD REALLY WAIT UNTIL THE SERIES IS FINISHED

2 I DON'T THINK KING-KILLER CAN BE PORTRAYED ON SCREEN WITHOUT COMPLETELY BUTCHERING THE NARRATIVE

I'D STILL WATCH THE FUCK OUT OF IT
MAN WRITES BRILLIANT SERIES OF BOOKS BUT ALL FANS SEEM TO HAVE TO WAIT FOREVER FOR THE COMPLETION NEXT EPISODE
ADAPTED FOR SCREEN WILD SUCCESS AUTHOR APPEARS TO HAVE LOST INTEREST IN FINISHING BOOKS
SCREEN ADAPTATION BECOMES EFFECTIVELY BECOMES THE IMPORTANT THING READERS LEFT HANGING ON FOR SCRAPS MAY DIE DISAPPOINTED

MMMM SOUNDS FAMILIAR

TO BE FAIR I LOVED THE FIRST TWO BOOKS OF THE KING-KILLER CHRONICLES I CANNOT REMEMBER WHEN I ENJOYED A FANTASY BOOK AS MUCH

FUCK ALL I'M STOKED NOW ALL WE NEED IS SOME CRAZY BASTARD WITH A BUTT TON OF MONEY TO PULL OFF THE MISBORN TRILOGY
IF ANYONE CAN EFFECTIVELY TRANSFER THE SCENE WHERE EVERYONE CRIES AFTER PERFORMANCE AT THE INN TO THE SCREEN IT'S LIN MANUEL MIRANDA
HAY HAS ANYONE BITCHED ABOUT THE LACK OF A THIRD BOOK YET BECAUSE I WANNA BITCH THAT THERE'S NO THIRD BOOK YET BECAUSE THERE IS NO THIRD BOOK YET AND THERE HAS TO BE THREE BOOKS TO MAKE A TRILOGY TRILOGY TRI THREE NO THIRD BOOK YET IN CASE NO ONE MENTIONED IT
WOW

I ADMIT I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE KING-KILLER CHRONICLES THE USUAL ISSUES WITH THE PROTAGONIST AND THE PLOT NOT GOING ANYWHERE COUPLE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK THE PROSE WON'T BE TRANSPORTED TO THE SCREEN AND I WAS READY TO SEE A TRAINWRECK

BUT THIS GUY CAN DO IT NOW I MIGHT ACTUALLY ENJOY THE SHOW AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT


AND IF IT DOES TURN OUT TO BE NOT THAT GREAT FANS MIGHT ACKNOWLEDGE THE FLAWS OF THE BOOKS INSTEAD OF JUST BLAMING ALL OF IT ON THE SHOW PEOPLE
IF ONLY THE AUTHOR WOULD STOP MESSING AROUND AND FINISH THE THIRD DAMN BOOK
I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WITH WISE MAN'S FEAR I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD MAKE AN INTERESTING SCREEN ADAPTATION OF WANDERING AROUND IN THE WOODS FOR A THOUSAND PAGES
DAMN NOW I REALLY GOTTA READ THEM
HOW ABOUT WE GET THE THIRD FUCKING BOOK FIRST
IF ANYONE CAN MAKE A SERIES ABOUT HARDCORE MEDIEVAL BUDGET MAKING INTERESTING IT'S MIRANDA
GONNA SUCK IF ROTHFUS FUCKS UP THE FINALE
I LIKED THE NAME OF THE WIND AND THOUGHT IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN THOUGH I HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH IT TO BE HONEST I'M NOT SURE I'LL EVER GET AROUND TO READING THE SECOND NOVEL BUT WOULD DEFINITELY WATCH A SERIES

I THINK MIRANDA WILL ROCK THIS IT'S A STORY ABOUT A MUSICAL GENIUS THE ACT OF CREATING WHICH SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING HE'D BE ABLE TO PACK SOME PUNCH INTO PLUS HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT LOVING ROTHFUSS FOR YEARS SO I THINK IT'S IN GOOD HANDS FOR THE HARDCORE FANS I'M REALLY INTERESTED TO HEAR THE MUSIC
LIN IS AN INCOMPARABLE TALENT AND A HUGE FAN OF THE TRILOGY AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH PAT HIS CREATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE FRANCHISE WILL BRING AN INCREDIBLE LEVEL OF DETAIL AND CONTINUITY TO ALL OF THE PROJECTS

TRILOGY WHERE'S THE THIRD BOOK ACKER
GREAT JOB
HOPING WE'LL ALSO GET AN FILM ABOUT KVOTHE IN THE FEY
OKAY GREAT COOL FINISH THE FUCKING BOOK BEFORE HAND THOUGH
IS NOW A GOOD TIME TO READ THE SERIES
GREAT JOB
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS EVEN IF ITS FAR AWAY I JUST WANT IT TO HAPPEN O
IF THIS HAPPENS IT WILL TAKE ABOUT A LIFETIME OF MOVIES BEFORE ANYTHING HALFWAY INTERESTING HAPPENS EVEN THEN IT WON'T BE ANY GOOD
AH YES THE SERIES I READ A LIFETIME AGO AND FORGOT COMPLETELY ABOUT WHILE FOR AN ENDING THAT MAY NEVER HAPPEN I COULDN'T CARE LESS HOW IT ENDS AT THIS POINT
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I PICK UP THE NAME OF THE WIND IT WAS THE FIRST BOOK I EVER BOUGHT IT WAS THE FIRST BOOK I ACTUALLY FELT ATTACHED TO THEN I LET SOMEONE BORROW IT AND THEY MOVED SIX STATES AWAY SO IT'S THE ONLY BOOK I'VE BOUGHT TWICE I GUESS WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS I REALLY HOPE IT DOESN'T GET BUTCHERED
UGH KVOTHE IS INSUFFERABLE AND SUCH A MARY SUE IT WILL BE HILARIOUS TO SEE AN ACTUAL PERSON PORTRAY THE CHARACTER AND FAIL TO LIVE UP TO ROTHFUSS EXPECTATIONS
I DON'T EVEN THINK MIRANDA WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE MAGICAL ADVENTURES OF GARY SLUMDOM INTERESTING HE'LL BE GREAT AT MAKING THE SONGS AND MUSIC POP FOR SURE BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR THE FACT THAT THE PLOT IS NEARLY NONEXISTENT IN THE FIRST TWO BOOKS WHEN YOU REALLY GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT AND EXAMINE WHAT WE'VE SEEN THUS FAR IN ALL LIKELIHOOD I THINK THE KING-KILLER CHRONICLES IS HEADED FOR A PRETTY ANTICLIMACTIC END IT APPEARS THAT ROTHFUSS IS STRUGGLING TO GET THE THIRD AND FINAL BOOK IN THE SERIES WRITTEN GIVEN HOW LONG IT'S TAKING HIM AND I CAN'T IMAGINE IT LIVING UP TO ALL THE EXPECTATIONS THE FIRST 2 BOOKS CREATED PROMISED I THINK ROTHFUSS IS FULLY INTENDING TO JUMP SHIP STRAIGHT INTO SCREENWRITING AND HE'LL ABANDON THE FINAL BOOK IN THE TRILOGY IN FAVOR OF WRITING FOR THE SHOW AND THEN OTHER NEW PROJECTS INSTEAD
MAKES DEFINITELY PROVEN HIMSELF TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT A SELF INSERT MARY SUE NARRATIVE
WHO THE FUCK IS THIS GUY I SAW HIM MADE FUN OF ON SNP CELEBRITY GUESTS JUTA NOWHERE
AS A LIBRARIAN I AM SO HAPPY TO READ YOUR POST
I WILL NEVER STOP USING MY LIBRARY I LOVE IT SO DAMN MUCH
THE LIBRARY IS MY NEXT STOP AFTER I FINISH THE BOOKS IN MY BOOKSHELF I HAVE A FEW PARTS OF SERIES THAT I PICKED UP AT LOCAL THRIFT STORES I PLAN ON FINDING AS MANY OF THE OTHER PARTS IN SERIES THERE FIRST AND THANKFULLY MY LOCAL BRANCH IS A MINUTE WALK FROM MY APARTMENT
THIS YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT I DECIDED TO DO THE GOODREADS CHALLENGE I SET THE BAR LOW AT BOOKS TO KEEP MYSELF FROM FEELING OVERWHELMED I HIT THAT GOAL IN THE SUMMER AND AM NOW AT CURRENTLY ON THE 2ND BOOK OF THE SERIES FANTASTIC AND HILARIOUS WISH I READ THEM SOONER THE GOODREADS CHALLENGE AND MY JOB HAVE FUELED MY NEW DESIRE FOR BOOKS AND I LOVE IT IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY TO BE READING AGAIN
I WORKED AT A LIBRARY FOR YEARS COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE JOB I'VE EVER HAD I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF READING MORE BACK THEN BUT OH WELL I CAN NOW
I'M HAPPY YOU HAVE FOUND A PLACE AT THE LIBRARY I HAVE SO MANY FOND MEMORIES OF TIME SPENT THERE FROM GROWING UP INTO YOUNG ADULTHOOD I'M HAPPY PEOPLE ARE FINDING IT AGAIN
THIS IS AWESOME THE LIBRARY IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN MY PRIMARY RESOURCE FOR BOOKS AND READING AS I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SOME LEVEL OF POOR AND RIGHT NOW I REALLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY AT ALL FOR BOOKS AND USUALLY DON'T HAVE MUCH ROOM TO STORE THEM SO I HATE BUYING THEM AND THEN TRYING TO GET RID OF THEM

THIS IS WHY IT BLOWS ME AWAY TO FIND AVID READERS WHO THINK SOMEHOW THEY ARE BETTER MORE INTELLIGENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PERSONAL LIBRARY I READ DOZENS OF BOOKS EACH YEAR AND ONLY HAVE A LIBRARY OF ABOUT GIVE OR TAKE MOST OF THEM NATURAL SCIENCE FIELD GUIDES
MY MOTHER USED TO TAKE ME TO THE LIBRARY ALL THE TIME AS A KID AS AN ADULT I WILL ADMIT I HAVE BECOME RATHER SPOILED BY BEING ABLE TO BUY MY OWN BOOKS HOWEVER WITH THE CLOSING OF MY FAVORITE LOCAL BOOKSTORE RIP HASTING I'VE BEGUN RUNNING SHORT ON OPTIONS THE ONLY WAY TO BUY BOOKS NOW IS ON MY KINDLE AMAZON OR DRIVING ALL THE WAY TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CITY BELOW US TO GO TO WHICH IS A BIT EXPENSIVE ANYWAY

I'VE ALSO BEGUN TO NOTICE HOW MUCH SPACE SOME OF MY BOOKS ARE STARTING TO TAKE UP IN MY HOUSE NOW I DO USE THE CAMPUS LIBRARY FOR STUDYING AND RESEARCH BUT I'M NOW STARTING TO TURN TOWARDS MY REGULAR LIBRARY AGAIN IF I DON'T FEEL LIKE LEAVING THE HOUSE NO PROBLEM I'VE DISCOVERED HOW TO RENT MY KINDLE BOOKS ON THEIR APP TOO VERY HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND MORE USE OUT OF THE LIBRARY AGAIN
AS A CURRENT CIRCULATION DESK ASSISTANT AND MLS GRAD STUDENT THIS WARMS MY HEART I ALWAYS TELL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ABOUT THE WONDERFUL RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT THE LIBRARY THEY'RE ALWAYS AMAZED BECAUSE OF THE INFURIATING MISCONCEPTION THAT LIBRARIES ARE DYING OUT FAR FROM TRUE
STEPHENSON IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS I RECOMMEND ALL OF HIS STUFF

THE BAROQUE CYCLE IS EASILY MY FAVORITE ANATHEMA IS ALSO QUITE GOOD THE DIAMOND AGE SNOW CRASH AND CRYPTONOMICON ARE SOME OF HIS MOST POPULAR
I LOVE WORK ALTHOUGH HE CAN GET QUITE WORDY THAT SEEMS TO PUT A LOT OF PEOPLE OFFICIAL I HAD TO RESTART QUICKSILVER THREE TIMES TO FINALLY GET THROUGH THE FIRST HALF THAT DID NOTHING BUT SETUP THE OTHER TWO BOOKS IN THE BAROQUE CYCLE

A TIP DIAMOND AGE IS A SEQUEL TO SNOW CRASH THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO STANDALONE NOVELS BUT ONE CHARACTER FROM SC DOES SHOW UP IN DA
YEA HE IS A QUITE WELL KNOWN AND WELL REGARDED AUTHOR SNOW CRASH IS PRETTY MUCH MANDATORY READING FOR MODERN SCI FI WHICH EVEN AT THAT IT WAS WRITTEN MORE THAN YEARS AGO I'VE GOT DIAMOND AGE ON A SHELF BUT HAVEN'T READ IT YET HOWEVER I HAVE READ OTHERS OF HIS WORK WHICH ARE ALL A SERIOUS BUT REWARDING COMMITTMENT
GLAD TO HEAR YOU ARE ENJOYING IT

IN MY OPINION THE FIRST HALF OF THE DIAMOND AGE IS AMONG BEST WORK BUT I AM A SUCKER FOR A STORY WELL-TOLD FROM A PERSPECTIVE EAST G TOM SAWYER HUCK FINN WHISTLING SEASON

THE SECOND HALF IMHO DOESN'T LIVE UP

I COULD NEVER LOVE SNOW CRASH EVEN THOUGH IT IS REVERED BY STEPHENSON FANS THE TONE OF THE WRITING DOESN'T CONNECT WITH ME WAY TOO GIMMICKY AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE IT ADVERTISES THE GIMMICKS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERING THEM

I THINK STEPHENSON REALLY HIT HIS STRIDE WITH CRYPTONOMICON THAT'S ALWAYS MY STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION FOR READERS INTERESTED IN STEPHENSON

THERE IS A SPEECH ABOUT HYPOCRISY IN THERE SOMEWHERE THAT SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING
I'VE READ EVERYTHING THE AUTHOR HAS WRITTEN SNOW CRASH WILL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE IN MY HEART BUT CRYPTONOMICON THE BAROQUE CYCLE WERE PROBABLY THE BEST WITH SEVEN-EYES BEING CLOSE BEHIND

AND IF YOU LIKE CHINA READE ALSO TOOK PLACE IN IT EDIT AND IT'S PARTIALLY SET IN PRESENT-DAY CHINA
LOVE STEPHENSON HOWEVER YOU SAID THIS IS YOUR FIRST BOOK BY HIM AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED IT SO I FEEL IT'S FAIR TO WARN YOU STEPHENSON IS KINDA KNOWN FOR NOT HAVING THE BEST ENDINGS IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE DECIDES TO STOP WRITING AS SOON AS THINGS ARE MOSTLY RESOLVED NO EPILOGUE NO CODA NO AND NOW THIS IS HOW THINGS ARE NOW JUST STOPS SOME HAVE SAID HE WRITES JUST ENOUGH TO END IT BUT MANY INCLUDING ME HAVE BEEN LEFT WANTING MORE OF A WRAP UP
IT SEEMS LIKE LAST YEAR EVERY ODD POST WAS REGARDING NEAL STEPHENSON SEVEN-EYES I ENJOYED THE FIRST RDS BUT THERE'S A BIT OF A TURN AT THAT POINT WHICH SORT OF LOST ME I WON'T SPOIL IT IN CASE YOU GET TO READ IT
STEPHENSON IS FAIRLY WELL KNOWN BUT DIAMOND AGE IS NOT ONE OF HIS BETTER KNOWN WORKS THE FAMOUS ONES ARE EITHER SNOW CRASH OR THE LATER ANATHEMA STUFF
I'VE READ SNOW CRASH CRYPTONOMICON AND DIAMOND AGE ENJOYED ALL OF THEM EVEN THOUGH CRYPTO WAS QUITE A SLAB TO GET THROUGH I SHOULD PROBABLY READ SOME OF HIS OTHER BOOKS AS WELL BUT I HAVEN'T FOUND THEM AT MY FAVORITE USED BOOK STORE YET

WITH SOME SIMILAR THEMES I THINK YOU ALSO MIGHT ENJOY CHARLES STOSS AS WELL ACCELERANDO PARTICULARLY STANDS OUT TO ME AS BEING IN SOME WAYS SIMILAR
BIG READER HERE ONE OF MY ALL TIME FACS GLAD YOU LIKED IT
DAMN THAT'S QUITE A DOORSTOP I'LL HAVE TO CHECK OUT THE PLOT SUMMARY ON WIKIPEDIA ONE OF THESE DAYS
AFTER FIRST FINISHING THIS BOOK I DISLIKED IT IT WAS FAR TOO LONG AND RAMBLING AND THE ENDING WAS NOTHING SPECIAL

BUT THEN LATER ON IN THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT TIMES AND MUNDANE PARTS OF MY DAY I WOULD FIND MYSELF THINKING ABOUT CATHY H AND TOMMY AND ALL THE CHILDREN IT'S SUCH A HAUNTING BOOK AND ONLY LATER WHEN I HAD TIME TO REFLECT ON IT DID I UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BOOK

THE BOOK IS BEAUTIFUL IT FEELS LIKE LIFE AND REAL LIFE EVERY TIME I RECALL AN EVENT IN THE BOOK I FEEL AS IF IT WAS A MEMORY OF MY OWN

I DON'T KNOW WHAT DRAWS ME BACK TO THIS BOOK I CAN'T PINPOINT IT

YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY READ THE REMAINS OF THE DAY MADAME HAS STUCK WITH ME THE MOST FROM NEVER LET ME GO
I ABSOLUTELY ADORE NEVER LET ME GO AND I REALLY URGE YOU TO READ REMAINS OF THE DAY AS WELL ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT IN THEME IT CARRIES MUCH THE SAME CONTEMPLATIVENESS AS NEVER LET ME GO
WHAT STRUCK ME WAS HOW MATTER OF FACTLY THEIR LIVES PURPOSE ARE PART OF THE NARRATIVE IT'S JUST QUIETLY TRUE WITH NO EXPLOSIVE SCENES OR REAL OUTRAGE AMAZING BOOK
THE BURIED GIANT WAS A TOUCHING STORY NARRATIVE QUEST IN OLD BRITAIN
I KNOW THIS IS BLASPHEMY BUT I LIKED THE MOVIE A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN I LIKED THE BOOK THE ACTUAL STORY IS REALLY GOOD BUT I THOUGHT THE MOVIE TOLD IT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY
ANOTHER VOICE RECOMMENDING REMAINS OF THE DAY ALTHOUGH IVE LIKED EVERYTHING I'VE READ FROM HIM I DIDN'T TEAR THROUGH NEVER LET ME GO LIKE I DID REMAINS OF THE DAY BUT IT STILL FELT LIKE A GOOD BOOK THOUGH NOT ALWAYS WHILE READING IT THE SADNESS AND THE JOURNEY YOU GO THROUGH WITH THE CHARACTERS IS SPECIAL
I READ THIS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS ACTUALLY IN A BOARDING SCHOOL AT THE TIME HAHA EXCEPT THEY WERE A BIT MORE CONCERNED WHEN WE WOULD HAVE SEX IN THE UNUSED CLASSROOMS
THE AUDIOBOOK IS AMMMMAZING PERFECT HAUNTINGLY CALM ACCENT
JUST READ THAT THIS PAST MONTH IT TRULY WAS AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL HAUNTING MESMERIZING STORY MY ONLY CRITICISM WAS THAT I WANTED TO SEE MORE OF THE DYSTOPIAN WORLD FLESHED OUT BUT I ALSO REALIZE THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE NARRATIVE
I FIRST WATCHED THE MOVIE LOVE CAREY MULLIGAN AND I CRIED AND CRIED AT THE END

THEN MY SISTER PICKED UP THE BOOK BY CHANCE AT A LIBRARY BOOK SALE AND I READ IT WHILE WE WERE ON VACATION IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE STORIES WHERE KNOWING THE END DOESN'T LESSEN THE IMPACT AT ALL I MUST HAVE CRIED FOR A HALF HOUR HAD TO KEEP PUTTING THE BOOK DOWN HAUNTING TO SAY THE LEAST I REMEMBER FEELING SO MOVED I HAD TO TELL MY MOM
THIS BOOK TORE THE HEART OUT OF ME
I HAD THE SAME REACTION TO THIS BOOK IT'S ACCOMPANIED BY ONE OF THE RARE BOOK TO MOVIE FILMS THAT ACTUALLY DOES THE RETELLING JUSTICE
THE UNCONSOLED IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
THE REMAINS OF THE DAY AND A PALE VIEWS OF HILLS ARE BOTH FANTASTIC I'VE READ THEM SO MANY TIMES REMAINS OF THE DAY SOMETIMES MAKES ME TEAR UP AT THE END BECAUSE I FEEL SO SAD FOR HIM
I FELT THE EXACT SAME WAY IT'S ONE OF THE BOOKS THAT'S REALLY STUCK WITH ME EVEN THOUGH I READ IT YEARS AGO NOW AND HAVE FORGOTTEN SOME OF THE SPECIFIC DETAILS IT'S SO HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL I'VE RECOMMENDED IT LEFT AND RIGHT BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS TAKEN ME UP ON THE RECOMMENDATION SO IT'S NICE TO SEE A LOT OF LIKE MINDED PEOPLE HERE

THE MOVIE WAS ALSO PRETTY GOOD ONE OF THE BETTER BOOK TO MOVIE ADAPTATIONS I'VE SEEN
THE LOGIC AND SCIENCE IN THIS BOOK WERE SO TERRIBLE I WANTED TO STOMP ON IT
I SAT NEXT TO A CUTE GIRL ON A PLANE RIDE THE OTHER DAY WHO WAS READING THIS BOOK SUCH SERENDIPITY NOW I HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK IT'S A SIGN
PG RODENHOUSE IS A MASTER SOMETIMES I'M SO BUSY LAUGHING AT WHAT HE'S WRITTEN I FORGET TO NOTICE HOW BEAUTIFUL HIS SENTENCES ARE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ AT LEAST THE JEEVES AND WOOSTER NOVELS FIND THEM NOW
RIGHT HO
I USED TO READ RODENHOUSE IN COLLEGE TO WIND DOWN AND THE ENGLISH MAJORS IN MY HALL WOULD MAKE FUN OF ME ONE OF THEM CAME UP TO ME NEAR THE END OF SENIOR YEAR AND APOLOGIZED THEY'D BEEN ASSIGNED JEEVES AND HE'D HAD A GLAD TO SEE THE ESTABLISHMENT IS COMING AROUND
PG RODENHOUSE MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST MASTERFUL WORDSMITH EVER TO LIVE

IF YOU ENJOY TERRY PRITCHETT AND HIS AMAZING TURNS OF PHRASE YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO CHECK OUT RODENHOUSE AS WELL

BESIDES THE SKILL AT WRITING THE CHARACTERS AND PLOT ARE BOTH ENDEARING AND FUNNY I FIND FEW BOOKS BRING ME SUCH QUIET CALM JOY I LISTEN TO THEM AN AUDIOTAPE DURING LONG DRIVES
IT HAS BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE READ PG RODENHOUSE BUT MY ADMIRATION HAS NOT DIMINISHED
GRUNTLED
HUE AND JEEVES AND WOOSTER IS A PERFECT DRAMATIZATION OF SAID LITERATURE


THE GREATNESS OF PAGE G WRITING IS THE ONE TOPIC I'VE SEEN UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT ABOUT IN FORMAL DEBATES ON RELIGION I KNOW IT'S WEIRD THAT IT EVEN COMES UP IN SUCH DEBATES SO TAKE THAT FOR WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT HOW BROADLY HIS APPEAL GOES
IF YOU NEED A LAUGH PLEASE CHECK OUT PG RODENHOUSE MY FAVORITES ARE THE BERTIE WOOSTER AND JEEVES BOOKS BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS THAT ARE VERY FUNNY AS WELL AND I M RELIEVED TO HEAR HE WASN T ACTUALLY A NAZI SYMPATHIZER SINCE I HAD READ THAT SOME TIME AGO AND IT DIMINISHED MY ENTHUSIASM FOR HIM
UNCLE DYNAMITE MAY BE THE BEST COMIC NOVEL I'VE EVER READ
MY FIRST WEBSITE WAS A TRIBUTE TO THE MASTER WORDSMITH WE KNOW AS PAGE G RODENHOUSE

I CULLED PUNS TURNS OF PHRASE AND WORDPLAY FROM ALL THE BOOKS I HAD READ AND PUT THEM ON THE SITE IT MIGHT BE SOMEWHERE IN THE DEEP RECESSES OF

PQ RODENHOUSE
IT'S A RARE PUBLIC LIBRARY THAT HAS A BIG RODENHOUSE COLLECTION HIS REPUTATION AS FRIVOLOUS AND THE AGE OF THE BOOKS ARE AGAINST HIM

THERE ARE OVER RODENHOUSE BOOKS AVAILABLE FOR FREE DOWNLOAD AT PROJECT GUTENBERG
AGREE WITH THIS ARTICLE MY MOM FAITH SULLIVAN WROTE A WELL-REVIEWED NOVEL ABOUT A MINNESOTA WOMAN'S LITERARY LOVE AFFAIR WITH RODENHOUSE CALLED GOOD NIGHT MR RODENHOUSE
TRY THE GOLF STORIES NOT ONLY ARE THEY BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN AND FUNNY THE OBSERVATIONS OF PEOPLE AND GOLFERS ARE SPOT ON HE WAS A MASTER WRITING ABOUT SOMETHING HE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT
I READ A COUPLE OF THESE AND ENJOYED THEM THE WRITING IS SUPERB FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE READ A LOT OF THEM ARE THERE ANY FEMALE CHARACTERS WHO AREN'T COMPLETE ASSES OR USELESS TWITS
I ABSOLUTELY ADORE RODENHOUSE HE IS PROBABLY MY MOST FAVORITE AUTHOR EVER I'VE READ EVERY SINGLE OF JEEVES AND WOOSTER STORIES MULTIPLE TIMES AND MOST OF HIS OTHER BOOKS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SNOBBISHNESS WHERE I GREW UP RODENHOUSE WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED GOOD AND WHOLESOME IF NOT HIGH-BROW LITERATURE A MARK OF SOMEONE WHO'S WELL-READ HIS LANGUAGE IS AN ABSOLUTE JOY TO READ
ONE OF THE FEW AUTHORS THAT MAKES ME CONSISTENTLY PUT DOWN THE BOOK AND TRULY LAUGH

AND HERE WE ARE TODAY
PROBABLY MY FAVORITE AUTHOR GLAD TO SEE HE'S GETTING HIS DUE
GOING TO GET MY MAN JEEVES FOR CHRISTMAS VERY EXCITED FOR THAT ONE
UNCLE FRED FLITS BY ANYONE ELSE CONSIDER THIS HIS GOLD STANDARD I'VE NEVER READ ANYTHING FUNNIER
TO ANYONE WHO LOVED THE JEEVES AND WOOSTER BOOKS I'D RECOMMEND CROME YELLOW BY ALDOUS HUXLEY IT'S VERY SIMILAR IN BEING A SARDONIC CHARACTER STUDY OF A BUNCH OF MISFIT ARISTOCRATS BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A VERY RODENHOUSE STYLE
COULDN'T AGREE MORE I CAN READ ANYTHING BY ANY AUTHOR AND LOVE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE BUT WITH RODENHOUSE I CAN'T REALLY COMPREHEND HOW HE WRITES THE WAY HE DOES I DON'T USE THE WORD GENIUS MUCH BUT WITH RODENHOUSE IT IS APT
LOVE LOVE LOVE RODENHOUSE EVER SINCE I WAS ABOUT OR SO SOMEONE GAVE ME A COPY OF LAUGHING GAS AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIS WRITING
I'LL FOREVER BE THANKFUL TO STEPHEN FRY FOR INTRODUCING ME TO RODENHOUSE HIS BOOKS ARE DELIGHTFUL

I RECOMMEND THE BELL JAR BY SYLVIA PLATH TO THIS LIST
I'M SURE I'LL BE DOWNVOTED TO HELL BUT SOMEONE HAS TO SAY IT I SUPPOSE I JUST FIND THE IDEA OF GENDER ASSOCIATING BOOKS UTTERLY WEIRD AND SOMETHING I CAN'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL

A LITTLE BLURB EXPLAINING THE PREMISE MAYBE SOME HISTORY ON THE BOOK AND WHY YOU RECOMMEND EACH ONE WOULD MAKE THIS LIST MUCH BETTER
AS IT STANDS I JUST GLANCE AT THE TITLES TO SEE WHAT I'VE READ AND MOVE ON
HONESTLY I FOUND THE EDIBLE WOMAN BY MARGARET ATWOOD A REALLY EMOTIONAL READ AND IT SPOKE ABOUT A WOMAN'S IDENTITY IN THE FACE OF IMPENDING MARRIAGE AND THE NEED TO FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO COMPROMISE WHAT WE WANT IN A PARTNER AS WE GET OLDER IN OUR DESPERATION TO BECOME PART OF THE STATUS QUO

WHILE THE TALE IS A GREAT BOOK AND VERY RELEVANT THE EDIBLE WOMAN IS BASED ON REAL WORLD LIFE GRANTED IN THE AND TO ME SPOKE ON A LEVEL I COULD UNDERSTAND WAY BETTER EVEN THOUGH I READ IT RECENTLY

TESS OF THE BY THOMAS HARDY EXAMINES THE UNFAIR STANDARDS WOMEN WERE HELD TO STILL REMARKABLY RELEVANT TODAY
JUST TO TURN A STEREOTYPE ON ITS EAR

I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OF THE COMMENTS ARE SUGGESTING WORTHY ADDITIONS TO THIS LIST I READ THROUGH THE DEFAULT PAGE OF COMMENTS ON THE MEN'S LIST AND SAW LOTS OF BITCHING ABOUT THE MERITS OR LACK THEREOF OF VARIOUS NAMED WORKS BUT VERY FEW RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BETTER TITLES


IF WE'RE LISTING CLASSICS I'D INCLUDE ANTIGONE BY SOPHOCLES
COULDN'T IT BE ARGUED THAT MEN WOULD BE THE ONES WHO SHOULD READ GENDER STUDIES WORKS

ALSO WHY MANGA
I RECOMMEND MY LIFE ON THE ROAD BY GLORIA STEINEM ALL THE SINGLE LADIES BY REBECCA TRAISTER AND YES PLEASE BY AMY POEHLER AND ANYTHING WRITTEN BY CHIMAMANDA NOZI ABICHITE
I HAVE NO LESS THAN OF THOSE ON MY SHELVES RIGHT NOW I'M TOTALLY GOING TO THROW IN SHRILL BY LINDY WEST TO THIS EVEN IF YOU AREN'T FAT THE MESSAGE ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN IS FABULOUS
HOW ABOUT HOME-GOING
FAINT PRAISE BY GAIL POOL
WOMEN AS LOVERS BY ELFRIEDA JELINEK
CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR
ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK BY PIPER KERMAN
THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES BY SUE MONK KID ONE OF MY AV COMING OF AGE NOVELS WITH LOTS OF GREAT FEMALE CHARACTERS

I'VE BEEN TOLD BY A FRIEND'S MOM THAT THE MERMAID CHAIR BY THE SAME AUTHOR IS ALSO GREAT BUT THAT I SHOULDN'T READ IT TILL I'M AT LEAST WHICH MEANS ITS GONNA GET READ VERY SOON
TENDER MORSELS BY MARGO LANAGAN
BY TONI MORRISON
BIASED BUT THE AGE OF INNOCENCE BY EDITH WHARTON
THE WOMEN'S ROOM BY MARILYN FRENCH
DANG I'VE READ FIFTY-SIX OFF THE MEN'S LIST AND SEVENTEEN OFF THE WOMEN'S LIST
NERVOUS CONDITIONS BY THITSI DANGAREMBGA IS ALSO AMAZING
THE YELLOW WALLPAPER BY CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN TECHNICALLY A SHORT STORY BUT DEFINITELY MEMORABLE
I'D LIKE TO SECOND THE BELL JAR HOW TO BE BOTH AND AMERICANA ALI THERE BUT FOR THE WAS ALSO HEARTBREAKING

WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SUGGEST BELOVED BY TONI MORRISON WUTHERING HEIGHTS BE EMILY BRONTE AND I FEEL EVERY WOMAN SHOULD READ AT LEAST ONE JANE AUSTEN EVEN IF IT IS TO CONFIRM YOU HATE IT

THE PRICE OF SALT OR CAROL BY PATRICIA HIGHSMITH

THE MOVIE IS PRETTY BUT DOESN'T QUITE DO IT JUSTICE
ADD THE DOOR B MAGDA SZABO ORLANDO BY VIRGINIA WOOLF LETTERS TO A CHILD NEVER BORN BY ORIANA FALLACE
EMPRESS BY SHAN SA
I'D ADD THE FIFTH SEASON BY N JEMISON TO THIS LIST PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S A MODERN CLASSIC AND DEFINITELY BELONGS ON THIS LIST
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND BOSSYPANTS BY TINA FEY
WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT OF THIS LIST SEEMS LIKE SPAM TO ME
WHICH IS THE ONE ABOUT FASCISM
MY LIST IS OF BOOKS YOU SHOULD READ IS FAIRLY SHORT AND SIMPLE
AHEM

WHATEVER YOU WANT
PERSONALLY I THINK EVERYBODY SEES SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THAT BOOK IT'S A BIT OF A MIRROR COME BACK AND READ IT IN TEN YEARS AND YOU'LL SEE IT ENTIRELY DIFFERENTLY
DID YOU INVENT THE WORD UNDERSTANDMENT
YOU CAN'T READ THIS BOOK AND JUDGE CHARACTER WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS HE'S STRUGGLING WITH
THIS BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THE UNRELIABLE NARRATOR IN PERSPECTIVE HE'S KIND OF TELLING IT LIKE HE SEES IT AND KIND OF TELLING IT THE WAY HE WANTS YOU TO SEE IT PROBLEM IS HE'S YOUNG AND IGNORANT AND SELF CENTERED AND ALSO HAS SOME MENTAL ISSUES SO HOW HE SEES IT IS WARPED AND HOW HE WANTS YOU TO SEE THINGS IS OFF BECAUSE HE DOESN'T PROPERLY EMPATHIZE WITH OTHERS

SO HE'S TRYING TO TELL A STORY WHERE HE'S THE HERO BUT IT'S EASY TO SEE THAT HE'S CLUMSILY TRYING TO BRAG ABOUT IMAGINARY STUFF TO GET APPROVAL
I THINK YOU COMPLETELY MISSED THE POINT OF THE BOOK IN MY OPINION NOT TO OFFEND

HOLDEN IS DEALING WITH SOME SERIOUS MENTAL ISSUES HE IS CONSTANTLY DEPRESSED LIKES NOTHING AND TALKS ABOUT DYING OR COMMITTING SUICIDE MORE THEN ONCE

I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE DEALT WITH DEPRESSION BUT GETTING ANGRY OR DISLIKING PEOPLE EASILY IS A POSSIBLE ASPECT OF DEPRESSION AT THE END HE WAS I'M PRETTY SURE IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION

THE STORY DIVES IN TO SOMETHING MUCH DEEPER THEN TEENAGE REBELLION BECAUSE REALLY HOLDEN ISN'T MUCH OF A REBEL AT ALL THE ONLY PEOPLE HE REALLY LIKED WERE HIS DEAD BROTHER I THINK HIS PASSING HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE MENTAL ISSUES THE NUNS THE WOMEN ON THE BUS AND PHEBE HE NEVER DISRESPECTED ADULTS HE JUST DIDN'T LIKE A LOT OF THEM

TO ME THE BOOK IS ABOUT SOME ONE DEALING WITH PROBABLY DEPRESSION AND TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM ALONG WITH COPING WITH A DISTANT FAMILY THE LOSS OF HIS BROTHER AND HIS EMOTIONS REALLY HOLDEN MAKES ME FEEL DEPRESSED AS HELL AS HE WOULD SAY

THIS IS JUST MY OPINION I'M NOT TRYING TO OFFEND YOU ITS JUST A NEW PERSPECTIVE


ALTHOUGH WHILE I WAS READING I LITERALLY WANTED TO BLOW MY BRAINS OUT BECAUSE HOLDEN IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF SHIT I HAVE EVER SEEN

HYPERBOLE MUCH
THE CATCHER IN THE RYE IS ONE OF THOSE BOOKS YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY EVERY FEW YEARS I'VE READ IT EVERY YEAR SINCE I WAS AND I ALWAYS FIND A NEW ANGLE ON IT DUE TO BEING A LITTLE OLDER AND A LITTLE WISER IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU UNDERSTAND IT ALL RIGHT NOW
MY PERCEPTION IS NAIVETY OF THE WORLD IS ONLY CURED BY NOT ACCEPTING SOCIETY AS IT IS BUT HOW HE DECIDES TO VIEW IT AS
YEAH I KINDA REMEMBER HATING THAT FUCKING KID THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BOOK HE JUST SPENDS THE WHOLE TIME WHINING EVEN WHILE ALL THESE INTERESTING THINGS ARE HAPPENING AROUND HIM LIKE WHY IS HE EVEN BREAKING FREE AND PUTTING HIMSELF THROUGH ALL THESE EXPERIENCES IF HE'S NOT EVEN GONNA TAKE A MINUTE TO ENJOY THEM LIKE HE GOT SLAPPED AROUND BY A PIMP ON A MISUNDERSTANDING THAT'S SOME COOL SHIT BUT NO THE ENTIRE WORLD IS STUPID AND HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS ANY SENSE WHEN HE'S GIVING THE METAPHOR ABOUT CHILDREN IN THE RYE HE'S SAYING WE'RE ALL CHILDREN AND HE FEELS COMPELLED TO STOP US FROM RUNNING OFF A CLIFF BECAUSE WE'RE SO SHORT SIGHTED HE CAN'T TRUST US TO KNOW WHERE THE EDGES ARE HE THINKS WE'RE IDIOTS AND HE'S DOING US ALL A FAVOR BY STRESSING OUT OVER THE DANGERS THAT ONLY HE CAN SEE BUT LIKE WHO THE FUCK IS HE TO ASSUME WE NEED A CATCHER IN THE RYE SHOULD I BE THANKFUL FOR THIS SERVICE HE'S PROVIDING I'M NOT A CHILD OR AT LEAST I CAN RUN MY LIFE OFF A CLIFF IF I WANT TO HE'S CASTING US AS IDIOTS AND CHILDREN TO INFLATE HIS OWN EGO AND JUSTIFY ALL THE STRESSING HE DOES ANYWAY AS LIKE A SERVICE TO SOCIETY HE'S JUST PRETENTIOUS AND BORING IS WHY HE STRUGGLES TO FIT IN NOT BECAUSE WE'RE OPERATING ON A LOWER FREQUENCY THAN HE IS IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE THROUGHOUT THE BOOK HOLDEN IS NOT EXACTLY A GENIUS HE'S JUST A BLOWHARD NARCISSIST
I PERSONALLY HATED STEPHEN SEQUEL TO THE SHINING DOCTOR SLEEP IT WAS A MEDIOCRE KING NOVEL AT BEST AND A HORRIBLE SEQUEL

I'D HAVE TO SAY THAT JURASSIC PARK DIDN'T NEED A SEQUEL EITHER
FOR ME IT'S GO SET A WATCHMEN ALL IT DID WAS DETRACT FROM TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD
CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY READ THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE ON THE NEXT BOOK IT GETS QUITE RIDICULOUS IMO
IT'S IRONIC BUT AS SOON AS I SAW THE TITLE OF THIS THREAD I THOUGHT OF THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES I THINK ANNE PROBLEM IS THAT SHE CAN'T WRITE THE PRESENT DAY AS LONG AS SHE'S WRITING IN A HISTORICAL SETTING IT'S GOOD BUT AS SOON AS THE TIME SWITCHES TO THE PRESENT IT'S AWFUL THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN THE WITCHING HOUR
I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT DUNE FIRST BOOK IS A CLASSIC IGNORE THE REST

I JUST BOUGHT A COPY OF DUNE I'VE HEARD SO MANY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT DON'T KNOW WHEN I'LL GET TO IT THOUGH SO MANY OTHERS ON MY TO READ PILE SHAME TO HEAR ABOUT THE REST OF THE DUNE SERIES DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH IT GIVING THEM AT LEAST A GLANCE OR WOULD I BE WASTING MY TIME
CATCH CLOSING TIME FELT COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY AND SPOILED THE CLIFFHANGER ENDING TO THE FIRST BOOK WISH I HADN'T READ IT
THE MOTE IN GOD'S EYE SEQUEL WAS TERRIBLE ORIGINAL WAS GENIUS
THE SPARROW BY MARY DORIA RUSSELL THE FIRST BOOK COMES WITH MY HIGHEST LEVEL OF RECOMMENDATION IT'S STAYED WITH ME OVER THE YEARS REALLY SHOULD HAVE JUST LEFT IT THERE NO NEED FOR A FOLLOW UP
THE OLD TESTAMENT THE NEW ONE WAS WAY TOO TONED DOWN TO APPEAL TO A WIDER AUDIENCE
THERE'S THREE BIG CLASSICS OF SCIENCE FICTION THAT GOT SEQUELS WHICH SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BOTHERED WITH

GAME IRONICALLY THE ORIGINAL WAS ONLY FLESHED OUT TO NOVEL LENGTH BECAUSE CARD WANTED TO ESTABLISH THE MAIN CHARACTER FOR SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD AND THE SUBSEQUENT NOVELS BUT THOSE WERE IN NO WAY AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL GAME IS THE EPITOME OF HARD SCI-FI WITH A GREAT SINGLE PREMISE WHEREAS THE SEQUELS DRIFT FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO WEIRD UNRELATED DIRECTIONS

RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA IT WAS NEVER INTENDED TO HAVE A SEQUEL BUT CLARKE WAS PERSUADED TO WORK WITH GENTRY LEE ON ONE AND YOU CAN TELL THAT IT'S ALMOST ALL LEE DIFFERENT STYLE DIFFERENT VISION WHILE NOT ALTOGETHER TERRIBLE I FIND THE ORIGINAL CLEANER MORE FOCUSED AND IT DOESN'T EXPLAIN TOO MUCH OF THE MYSTERY

RINGWORLD I NEVER LIKED THE ORIGINAL RINGWORLD AS MUCH AS SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE THE PLOT WAS REALLY AN EXCUSE FOR THE LITERARY EQUIVALENT OF SCENERY PORN SHOWING OFF ALL THE STUFF THAT THE CHARACTERS RAN IN TO ALONG THE WAY BUT THE SEQUEL WAS PRETTY MUCH JUST CAPITALIZING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE FIRST AND DIDN'T LIVE UP TO STANDARDS
AUSTRALIAN KIDS GREW UP READING THE TOMORROW SERIES BY JOHN MARSDEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY ICONIC

AND THEN HE REBOOTED THE SERIES
MY SWEET ADRIANA BY VC ANDREWS SHOULD HAVE STAYED A STAND ALONE BOOK
NOT EXACTLY ONE BOOK BUT THE INITIAL EARTHPEA TRILOGY SHOULD HAVE STAYED JUST THAT LE GUIN RETURNED TO THE STORY SOME YEARS AFTER WRITING THE THIRD BOOK AND IN MY OPINION DESTROYED A LOT OF WHAT WAS MEANINGFUL IN THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY
AND ALL THAT

AND NOW ALL THIS ONLY HAS ONE BIT THAT IS TRULY MEMORABLE
DUNE CAN GET AWAY WITH ONE OR EVEN TWO MORE BOOKS BUT AFTER THAT HERBERT JUST BEAT A DEAD HORSE AND THEN HIS SON CAME ALONG
AFTER YOU BY JOJO MOYES ENJOYABLE BUT NOT REALLY NECESSARY
LET'S BE HONEST CURSED CHILD IN THE HARRY POTTER UNIVERSE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE EXISTED THE ORIGINAL SEVEN BOOKS SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT ALONE I'M ALL FOR DIFFERENT STORIES ABOUT DIFFERENT CHARACTERS SET IN THE MAGICAL WORLD LIKE THE FANTASTIC BEASTS MOVIE BUT CURSED CHILD WAS A DISASTER
THE GUNSLINGER I HATE ALL THE SUBSEQUENT BOOKS SUSANNA IS THE WORST CHARACTER IN ANY BOOK I'VE EVER READ AND THAT STUPID SENTIENT TRAIN SEEMED LIKE A BAD SHORT STORY IDEA I LOVED THE GUNSLINGER AS A STAND ALONE NOVEL THE ENDING FELT SO COMPLETE BOLD AND FINAL
ANNIHILATION BY JEFF VANDERMEER THE FIRST ONE IS LOADED WITH ATMOSPHERE AND HAS A GOOD AMBIGUOUS ENDING THE SECOND ONE READS LIKE A BUSINESS AUDIT AND THE THIRD ONE UNDOES ALL OF THE INTRIGUE WITH FLASHBACKS FILLING IN DETAILS WE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT

THE HYPERION CANTOS IF THAT COUNTS THE FIRST TWO BOOKS CAN'T DO WITHOUT EACH OTHER BUT THE SECOND TWO ARE JUST UNNECESSARY AND A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ I HAVEN'T READ THE SEQUEL BUT IT SEEMS POINTLESS TOO
THANKFULLY THE SERIES IS DYING OUT AND I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT IT FOR YEARS BUT THE YOUNG ADULT SERIES CALLED APPRENTICE REALLY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH OR SOONER

AS A TEEN THAT WAS THE FIRST SERIES TO TRULY DISAPPOINT ME I HAVEN'T TRUSTED LONG FANTASY SERIES SINCE AND USUALLY HAVE TO CONSULT FRIENDS OR REVIEWS BEFORE I COMMIT MYSELF TO READING BOOKS THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD OF

APPRENTICE IS THE POSTER CHILD OF A SERIES FULL OF POTENTIAL RUINED BY AN AUTHOR WHO STARTED THE SERIES WITH NO TRUE VISION IN MIND AFTER A FEW BOOKS YOU REALIZED HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WANTED THE STORY TO GO AND HAD NO ACTUAL CONCLUSION OR ENDING IN MIND

THE FIRST BOOKS ARE SET WITHIN A FANTASY STYLE WORLD WITH MONSTERS AND EVIL TYRANTS FULL OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND GOOD STORYTELLING THEN THE MONSTERS SOMEHOW JUST GO AWAY IN THE NEXT BOOKS NEVER TO BE SPOKEN OF OR HEARD FROM AGAIN ALONG WITH THE EVIL TYRANT GUY THEN THE MAIN CHARACTERS START TO BASICALLY REVERSE THEIR DEVELOPMENT POLARIZING INTO JUST A BLAND PORTRAIT OF THEMSELVES THIS BOY'S A NOBLE HERO THIS GIRL'S A PRETTY DIPLOMAT THIS MAN'S A HARDENED VETERAN BLAH BLAH BLAH

THE AUTHOR EVENTUALLY HAD TO RELEASE A BOOK CALLED THE LOST CHRONICLES OR SOME CRAP LIKE THAT IN ORDER TO FILL THE GIANT GAPING HOLES HE LEFT IN THE ORIGINAL BOOKS WAIT THEY'RE MARRIED NOW WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN STUFF LIKE THAT IT WAS JUST A DISASTER

I DONATED ALL OF MY COPIES TO GOODWILL AND DON'T WANT TO EVER TOUCH THEM AGAIN
REALLY IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SCARY I WOULDN'T PUT STEPHEN KING IN THERE EXCEPT FOR HIS SHORT STORIES AND MAYBE IT THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER STUFF OUT THERE SUCH AS THE BIRD BOX OR THE TROOP THAT'S HAVE GREAT CONCEPTS WELL EXECUTED
I'VE READ IT AND BAG OF BONES AND AFTER BOTH I THINK I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I MIGHT NOT GET SCARED IN LITERATURE AND IT JUST DOESN'T TRANSLATE THE SAME WAY FOR ME AS ON TV OR FILM ALSO I TYPICALLY DON'T THINK STEPHEN BOOKS NEED TO BE AS LONG AS THEY ARE
TRY THE STAND BY STEVEN KING MUCH BETTER
LET THE RIGHT ONE IN BY JOHN AJVIDE LINDQUIST
I THINK HE WRITES HORROR BUT ISN'T SCARY PER SE I ENJOYED LOT AS I ONLY GOT AROUND TO READING IT A YEAR OR SO AGO AND THIS WAS AT A TIME WHEN VAMPIRES WERE REPRESENTED WITH AN AIR OF ROMANCE AND MYSTICISM ABOUT THEM WHEREAS THE BOOK WAS JUST YEAH THEY'RE VAMPIRES AND THEY LURE YOU IN TO KILL YOU END OF
THE MOVIE TERRIFIED ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD BUT HIS BOOKS ARE MORE CHILLING GORY OR FUNNY IMO

SCARIEST BOOK I EVER READ HAMM COUCH WAS SUPER SUSPENSEFUL BUT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WOULD THINK IT SCARY
I LOVED LOT BUT IT WASN'T SCARY I LIKED THE WAY HE TREATED THE VAMPIRES LIKE LITTLE BIT LIKE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS IT WAS REFRESHING TO SEE THE TROPE GET A MONSTROUS TREATMENT AGAIN AFTER YEARS OF ANNE INFLUENCE

I THOUGHT SOME OF THE CHARACTERS JUMPED THROUGH PLOT HOOPS THOUGH IT MADE NO SENSE WHY THE GIRL FORGET HER NAME AND BOY WOULD GO TO THAT HOUSE ALONE IT STRUCK ME PARTICULARLY IRONIC SINCE KING RAILS AGAINST CHARACTERS JUMPING THROUGH PLOT HOOPS IN THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EDITION I READ

OVERALL I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER POSTERS STEPHEN KING IS NOT SCARY WHICH IS NOT TO SAY I DON'T ENJOY SOME OF HIS WRITING I'VE COME TO THINK IF HIM AS THE QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN WRITER HE DEPICTS THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS CULTURE WELL

I THINK THE SCARIEST THINGS I'VE READ WERE IN HARUKI MURAKAMI NOVELS THE WIND-UP BIRD CHRONICLE ANYONE
SALEM LOT ENTERTAINED ME BUT DIDN'T SCARE ME

PET CEMETARY SCARED ME THOUGH
I WASN T SCARED OF SALEM S LOT MY MOTHER WAS AND STILL IS EVEN THOUGH SHE FIRST STUMBLED ACROSS IT AS A KID SIMILARLY I WASN T SCARED OF IT BECAUSE CLOWNS DON T BOTHER ME ONE OF MY COWORKERS HATE CLOWNS AND WAS TERRIFIED OF IT MY YOUNGER SISTER IS SCARED OF VENTRILOQUIST DUMMIES AND EVEN NOW SHE S IN HER IS STILL SCARED OF THE GOOSEBUMPS BOOKS WITH SLAPPY IN THEM I M NOT A MASSIVE FAN OF SLUGS SO WHEN THEY WERE EATING PEOPLE IN SLUGS BY SHAUN HUTCHINSON I WAS TERRIFIED EVEN THOUGH OTHER PEOPLE I KNOW WHO READ IT JUST FOUND IT A LITTLE CREEPY DISGUSTING STUPID

I THINK THAT WITH HORROR BOOKS IS THEY RE ONLY GOING TO BE OUTRIGHT SCARY IF YOU YOURSELF ARE OUTRIGHT SCARED OF WHAT S IN THEM IF IT S NOT ABOUT SOMETHING YOU ARE SCARED OF YOURSELF THEN YOU RE JUST GOING TO BE READING SOMETHING CREEPY UNSETTLING I M NOT SAYING THAT S A BAD THING BUT IF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR A BOOK TO TERRIFY THEM THEN THEY SHOULD FIND A BOOK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT THEY RE ACTUALLY SCARED OF THEN IT WILL ACTUALLY BE TERRIFYING
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING ABOUT CUJ NOT SCARY AND HONESTLY KIND OF BORING IT'S NOT EVEN AN ISSUE OF CELL PHONES MAKE THE PLOT IRRELEVANT WHICH THEY SORT OF DO BUT COULD BE WRITTEN AROUND IT JUST WASN'T THAT THRILLING
WILL THEY BE READING HAMLET OR MACBETH IN YEARS AS OFTEN AS THEY DO TODAY
I WONDER IF OR SO YEARS IS ENOUGH TIME FOR THE GREATNESS OF A WORK TO BE ESTABLISHED YEARS AGO RUDYARD KIPLING STILL WRITING AT THAT TIME WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREATEST WRITERS EVER RANKED ABOVE DICKENS AND THE OTHER GREATS OF THE CENTURY WHO READS HIM NOW BEYOND A HANDFUL OF ACADEMICS AND AFICIONADOS

I WONDER WHETHER FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL IGNORE THE SELF-REGARDING FICTIONS OF EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA OUR NOVELS ARE USUALLY FIXED IN A TIME AND A PLACE IN WAYS THAT SHAKESPEARE REALLY ISN'T WHICH MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR WHY SO MANY PRODUCTIONS OF HIS PLAYS BRING THE ACTION FORWARD TO A OR CENTURY SETTING WHICH NOVELS INCLUDING MODERN NOVELS SET IN THE PAST MOVE BEYOND THE CULTURE OF THEIR OWN TIME AND PLACE WHICH WILL STILL SPEAK TO FUTURE GENERATIONS
IF THIS TOPIC REALLY INTERESTS YOU I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU LISTEN TO CHUCK KLOSTERMAN SPEAK ON THIS TOPIC ON ECONTALK

CHUCK MAKES THE POINT THAT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE SUCH PREDICTIONS NOW BECAUSE THE MARK OF GREATNESS IS DEFINED BY HOW WELL A WORK CONNECTS WITH FUTURE READERS NOT BY HOW WELL IT CONNECTS WITH CONTEMPORARY READERS

IT'S A COMPELLING ARGUMENT AND AN INTERESTING LISTEN AND FREE
BATTLEFIELD EARTH YEAH YOU'RE LAUGHING NOW BUT YOU WON'T BE LAUGHING WHEN THE SCIENTOLOGISTS TAKE OVER
HAROLD ROBBINS JACQUELINE SUZANNE
REALISTICALLY WITHOUT JUST NAMING MY FAVORITE BOOKS BUT ONES I THINK WILL STAND THE TEST OF YEARS FOR THE IMPACT THEY MADE TO THE GENRE HARRY POTTER I WANT TO SAY GAME OF THRONES BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL FOR THE SAME REASONS I DON'T THINK LOAR WILL BE READ AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE SO MANY I LOVE AND I THINK ARE BETTER THAN HP OR GOT BUT NONE THAT WILL LAST YEARS
SHAKESPEARE FOR DUMMIES
IN YEARS NO ONE WILL BE READING ANYTHING WE WILL HAVE DEVELOPED THE ABILITY TO IMPUTE FEELINGS AND IDEAS DIRECTLY INTO THE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS THE PHYSICAL PROCESS OF READING WORDS AND PROCESSING LANGUAGE WILL HAVE LIKELY FALLEN OUT BEFORE HONESTLY I'M PROBABLY WAY OFF BUT I WOULD SAY THAT MY PREDICTION IS ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE AND THE REALITY WILL BE MORE DRAMATIC YEARS AGO THE THINGS WE'RE DOING NOW WOULD BE CONSIDERED MAGIC GIVEN THE ARCH OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS ITS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHERE WE WILL BE YEARS FROM NOW LET ALONE THE ASPECT OF LITERATURE THAT HAVE KEPT CLASSICS MODERN ARE THINGS WHICH SPEAK TO THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF THE HUMAN CONDITION WITH THE ONSET OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN COULD CHANGE DRASTICALLY IF ANYTHING WE'LL BE READING CLASSICS TO GET A FEEL FOR WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE HUMAN BUT IT'LL PROBABLY BE PREFERABLE ALOT MORE FUN FOR US TO RUN ANCESTOR SIMS INSTEAD WHY READ SHAKESPEARE WHEN YOU CAN LIVE THROUGH A SIMULATION AS ONE OF HIS MAJOR CHARACTERS
AS OFTEN AS SHAKESPEARE IN A SCHOOL SETTING MAYBE NOTHING

TIP FOR A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION ABOUT MACBETH WHICH MAY HELP ENHANCE APPRECIATION FOR THE PLAY CHECK OUT THIS INTERVIEW OF KENNETH BRANAGH ABOUT PLAYING HIM IN A PRODUCTION FROM A FEW YEARS BACK WARNING PLOT SPOILERS
WRITTEN KIDS STORIES WEREN'T REALLY A THING YEARS AGO BUT SINCE THINGS ARE MUCH DIFFERENT NOW I WOULDN'T BE MASSIVELY SURPRISED IF HARRY POTTER IS A CLASSIC SERIES OF KIDS TALES IN THE FUTURE SORT IF IN THE SAME WAY OUR KIDS NOW STILL READ BEATRIX POTTER'S WORKS BUT WITH MORE OF A TIME GAP SOME STORIES ARE JUST TIMELESS

IN TERMS OF ADULT BOOKS I THINK A FEW OF THE GREAT AMERICAN AUTHORS WILL CONTINUE TO BE POPULAR BUT THEY'RE MOSTLY A LITTLE OUTSIDE OF THE SCALE OF DATES THAT OP PROVIDES COULD CORMAC MCCARTHY AND PHILIP ROTH STILL BE UP THERE
HARRY POTTER PERHAPS LOAR IS ALREADY QUITE OLD AND STILL READ
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE TO CALL I'M STRUGGLING TO THINK OF ANYTHING I ACTUALLY THINK WILL ENDURE MOST STUFF THAT LASTS FOR CENTURIES TENDS TO DO SO BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TO DO SOMETHING LOAR BASICALLY GAVE US FANTASY AS WE KNOW IT TODAY SHAKESPEARE FAMOUS FOR HIS USE OF LANGUAGE AND PRETTY MUCH INVENTING THE CLASSY INSULT

SO TAKING SOME POPULAR BOOKS OF TODAY TWILIGHT HARRY POTTER THE MARTIAN SHADES OF GREY AS EXAMPLES SURE THEY ARE WILDLY POPULAR BUT NONE ARE REALLY GROUNDBREAKING OR THE PINNACLE OF LITERATURE K BOWLING HERSELF ADMITS WRITING HERSELF INTO A CORNER AND HAVING TO ADD PIECES JUST TO COVER THE POTENTIAL PLOT HOLES TWILIGHT AND SHADES ARE MASS PRODUCED PIECES OF TRASH NO-ONE TALKS ABOUT THEM NOW NEVER MIND YEARS

I'M SURE THERE ARE BOOKS THAT WILL ENDURE YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED RECENTLY BUT I DOUBT IT WILL BE ANYTHING THAT IS INSANELY POPULAR NOW AND I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING I'VE READ RECENTLY
INFINITE JEST BECAUSE NO ONE ACTUALLY READS SHAKESPEARE
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT AND IT MIGHT BE THAT NOTHING FROM OUR ERA WILL BE REMEMBERED AS MUCH IN THE FUTURE AS HE IS NOW AFTER ALL NOTHING FROM A CENTURY BEFORE SHAKESPEARE OR A CENTURY AFTER IS QUITE SO WELL REMEMBERED THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OF ANY ERA HAVING SUCH A CHAMPION

ENDURING FAME MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THE NOT YEARS SINCE HE DIED COINCIDE WITH THE RISE OF ENGLISH AS A GLOBAL LANGUAGE AND SUCH A LANGUAGE NEEDS A ON A SIMILARLY SWOLLEN SCALE

I CAN SEE THE NEXT CENTURIES BRINGING A FRACTURING OF CULTURE IN SOME WAYS RATHER THAN FURTHER HOMOGENIZATION AS TECHNOLOGY MEANS PEOPLE CAN HAVE THEIR OWN CUSTOMIZED INTERESTS WHICH MEANS THE AGE OF UNIVERSALLY RECOGNISED SUPERSTARS MAY BE ENDING
I'D ARGUE HEINLEIN HAS A DECENT CHANCE OF BEING ON THAT LIST WHILE THE SCIENCE PART OF HIS SCI-FI WILL LIKELY BE HORRIBLY DATED THE UNDERLYING POLITICAL THEMES I THINK WILL STILL BE RELEVANT

IF WE SLIGHTLY STRETCH THE TIMELINE WE CAN INCLUDE STARSHIP TROOPERS THUS ROUNDING OUT WHAT I THINK OF AS HIS POLITICAL TRILOGY WITH STARSHIP TROOPERS REPRESENTING MILITARISM FASCISM STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND REPRESENTING COMMUNISM SOCIALISM AND THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS REPRESENTING LIBERTARIANISM ANARCHISM

IN YEARS ITS HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT TECHNOLOGY OR AN AVERAGE LIFE WILL LOOK LIKE BUT I STRONGLY SUSPECT OUR POLITICAL SYSTEMS AND DEBATES WILL STILL TOUCH ON THOSE THEMES
DUNE SEEMS LIKE A FAIR CANDIDATE
THE FALL OUT BOY STORY THE TALE OF THE RISE TO INTERNATIONAL FAME AND ROCK STARDOM INVOKES A LARGER CULTURAL NARRATIVE OF THE RISE OF THE EVERYMAN TO ROCK AND ROLL GLORY
IN YEARS THERE WILL BE NO MORE BOOKS DATA WILL JUST FLOW FREELY THROUGH ALL AND ALL WILL BE ONE
EH IT'S NOT REALLY A LIST
MY BEST SEX SCENES IN A BOOK WILL FOREVER BE THE ONE IN DEAN KOONTZ SERVANTS OF TWILIGHT

I WILL SHAMELESSLY SAY THAT YO ME WOULD EVEN AP WHEN THE TWO MAIN SEX SCENES INSIDE
I DON'T ENCOUNTER VERY MANY GREAT SEX SCENE SINCE I TEND TO READ MORE MURDER COMEDY AND WHEN THEY DO MOP-UP IT IS USUALLY EITHER VERY VAGUE BLAND OR HUMOROUS BUT THIS ONE BOOK I THINK IT WAS CALLED BAD BOYS ONLINE DEFINITELY GOT ME TO BLUSH AND I HIGHLY DOUBT THOSE WOULD BE CONSIDERED GREAT EITHER I THINK I'LL JUST HAVE TO STICK TO THE REAL THING
THE WRITER OF THE ARTICLE A MAN CHOOSES AT LEAST AS MANY WOMEN AUTHORS AS MEN AND MENTIONS SARAH WATERS VERY FAVOURABLY I WOULD AGREE THE DESPERATE SEX IN THE PAYING GUESTS WHICH HE DOESN'T MENTION IS AS GOOD AS ANYTHING I'VE EVER READ
ROBERT OLEN BUTLER DID GOOD IN THEY WHISPER
IF YOU WANT TO READ CLASSICS READ CLASSICS GR WILL THEN RECOMMEND THEM TO YOU BUT YEAH HARRY POTTER IS THE HIGHEST RATE BOOK ON GR WELL I THINK IT STILL IS BUT BOOKS THAT ARE PUSHED ON READERS FOR HIGH SCHOOL GET LOW RATINGS BECAUSE INEVITABLY PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THEM I DON'T THINK THERE IS A PERFECT SYSTEM OUT THERE IT WILL INEVITABLY HAVE THIS FLAW
I SWEAR MANY READERS ON GOODREADS ARE YOUNG ADULT READERS THIS IS NOT A BAD THING IN ITSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM NEARLY EVERY BOOK THAT ISN'T AN INCREDIBLY POPULAR YA BOOK IS GOING TO END UP WITH A POOR RATING FOR THE MOST PART IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE GOODREADS IS A GREAT SYSTEM OVERALL BUT THE RATINGS DON'T HAVE MUCH RELEVANCE TO ME ANYMORE WHEN TRYING TO CHOOSE A BOOK
IT DEPENDS WHAT SORT OF READER YOU ARE I LIKE A PARTICULAR KIND OF FICTION INCLUDING BOOKS THAT ARE REGARDED AS CLASSICS MANY READERS ON GOODREADS DON'T RATE THOSE BOOKS VERY HIGHLY SO THEY DON'T GET GOOD SCORES SO I FIND OTHER SOURCES SUCH AS REVIEWS FROM NEWSPAPERS AND WEBSITES I'VE FOUND RELIABLE IN THE PAST
GIVEN THAN GOODREADS IS LARGELY A MOBILE SOCIAL MEDIA DRIVEN PLATFORM IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE DEMOGRAPHIC SKEWS YA A LOT OF THE HISTORICAL CLASSICS PROBABLY HAVEN'T BEEN ASSIGNED TO THEM IN CLASS YET THIS ISN'T GOOD OR BAD NECESSARILY I FIND GOODREADS USEFUL FOR KNOWING WHAT THE NEXT TREND IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT HP HUNGER GAMES READY PLAYER ONE ETC I LIKE TO KEEP UP ON THESE NEW TRENDS EVEN THOUGH I'M MIDDLE AGED BECAUSE THOSE ARE GOING TO BE THE CULTURAL REFERENCE POINTS FOR THE NEXT WAVE OF YOUNG ADULTS EVENTUALLY THE DOCTORS AND LAWYERS I'LL BE RELYING ON FOR CLASSICS AVOID THE MASS RATINGS AND FIND SOME PEOPLE YOU ADMIRE OR RESPECT AND READ THEIR SPECIFIC REVIEWS
RATING MATTERS MORE OR LESS I HAVE READ MANY HORRIBLY WRITTEN BOOKS WITH ASTONISHINGLY HIGH RATING IN GOODREADS ONCE EVERY FEW MONTHS I HAVE TO LOOK UP THE DEFINITION IF AMAZING ON GOODREADS JUST BECAUSE OF HOW FREQUENTLY PEOPLE RATE POORLY WRITTEN BOOKS
COMPARING GOODREADS RATINGS IS WORTHLESS LIKE COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES
GOODREADS IS A SHITHOLE DON'T GO BY THEIR RATINGS
BOOK SHOW OATHBRINGER
THIS BOOK ISN'T OUT YET BUT HAS GIVEN STARS TIMES I LIKE GOODREADS BUT THEIR RATING SYSTEM IS FLAWED
I JUST CHECKED MY MASS MARKET EDITION AND ALL THE PAGE NUMBERS ARE IN THE RIGHT ORDER THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPRINTINGS SO IT SEEMS LIKE YOURS GOT A BIT MESSED UP
BRANDON SANDERSON DID AN AMA HERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK HERE'S A LINK TO ALL OF OUR UPCOMING AMAS

I AM A BOT AND THIS ACTION WAS PERFORMED AUTOMATICALLY PLEASE CONTACT THE MODERATORS OF THIS SUBREDDIT MESSAGE COMPOSE TO R BOOKS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS
NOT THIS BOOK EXACTLY BUT I HAVE HAD PRINTINGS LIKE THIS BEFORE SOME SORT OF PUBLISHING MISHAP
IT'S USUALLY A PRINTING ISSUE IF YOU TAKE IT INTO A BOOKSTORE AND SHOW THEM THEY'LL USUALLY LET YOU GET A REPLACEMENT COPY NO QUESTIONS ASKED SINCE IT'S DEFECTIVE
FOR MANGA CHECK IF INSTOCKTRADES SHIPS TO THE UK I ORDER GRAPHIC NOVELS FROM THEM AND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THE GOLD STANDARD FOR PACKAGING THOSE
TRY HAVING THEM SHIPPED SEPARATELY SO THEY ARE SHIPPED TIGHTLY IN A BOX THEIR SIZE
I RECOMMEND SNOW CRASH IT'S A HILARIOUS THRILLER WHICH DESCRIBES A DYSTOPIAN UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE INTERNET SUBURBANIZATION AND ARE CATAPULTED TO THEIR LOGICAL EXTREMES
I'M A HUGE FAN OF RAY BRADBURY

MY REC
FAHRENHEIT IS SHORT SO KNOCK THAT ONE OUT FIRST THEN CHOOSE ONE OF THE OTHER TWO I'D CHOOSE BRAVE NEW WORLD IT HAS MORE IMPACT AND LEFT ME THINKING MORE THAN DID ALTHOUGH IT ALSO IS A GREAT READ
READ NECROMANCER YES I KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY CYBERPUNK BUT CYBERPUNK AND DYSTOPIAN ARE REALLY CLOSE IT'S ALSO AMAZING
DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY BUT PERSONALLY I FIND TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF THE THREE BECAUSE IT'S ALSO THE MOST PLAUSIBLE THE OTHERS RAISED INTERESTING ISSUES BUT THEY JUST DIDN'T RING TRUE TO ME IN THE SAME WAY THAT DID THE WORLDS THEY PRESENTED SEEMED MORE EXAGGERATED I GUESS LIKE THEY'RE WHAT THINGS WOULD BE LIKE IF WE TOOK CERTAIN THINGS TO THEIR EXTREME CONCLUSIONS BUT I COULDN'T SEE OUR CIVILIZATION ACTUALLY LOOKING QUITE LIKE THAT
I'VE READ A LOT OF THIS TYPE OF FICTION I LIKE THEM IN EXACTLY THE ORDER LISTED BUT THEY ARE ALL FANTASTIC
BRAVE NEW WORLD WAS AMAZING I LOVED FAHRENHEIT WAS GOOD BUT MY LEAST FAVOURITE OF THE THREE

THE FIRST WORD THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN I THINK OF EACH

FAHRENHEIT CENSORSHIP
BRAVE NEW WORLD TECHNOLOGY
DICTATORSHIP

PICK WHICH SOUNDS THE MOST INTERESTING TO YOU I THINK IS THE MOST TOPICAL AND WHILE I LOVE FAHRENHEIT A LOT BRAVE NEW WORLD REALLY ASTOUNDED ME WHEN I READ IT WITH HOW PRESCIENT IT WAS
I REALLY WANNA READ A CLOCKWORK ORANGE SOMETIME SINCE I LOVE THE FILM IT FITS IN WITH THIS GENRE
DYSTOPIAN NOVELS ARE MY FAVORITE GENRE SO SAYING I LIKE ALL THREE ISN'T A HUGE SURPRISE

BUT BRAVE NEW WORLD IS POSSIBLY MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK AND FAHRENHEIT ARE BOTH GOOD BUT BRAVE NEW WORLD IS CAPTIVATING THE DYSFUNCTION OF THE UTOPIA IS MORE INTERESTING AND MORE INVENTIVE AT LEAST I THINK THAN THE OTHER TWO READ THEM AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK
THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT BOOKS BUT NOT JUST SCI-FI YOU SHOULD REALLY READ ASIMOV PHILIP KING DICK ROBERT THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS IS A GOOD ONE
I DIDN'T FIND BRAVE NEW WORLD THAT ENJOYABLE AS I WAS READING IT BUT IT REALLY HAD ME THINKING ABOUT IT AFTER I WAS DONE
I WOULDN'T START WITH BRAVE NEW WORLD IT'S AN INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENTLY WRITTEN BOOK AND PROBABLY HAS THE MOST RELEVANCE TO THE CURRENT STATE OF THE WORLD BUT IT IS NOT EXCITING

IS THE MOST ENTERTAINING READ AS AN ACTUAL STORY NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT INTELLIGENT AND MEANINGFUL BUT ALSO ON THE SIMPLEST MOST IMMEDIATE LEVEL IT'S THE MOST EXCITING I'D SAY FAHRENHEIT IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TWO
CONSIDERING THAT THOSE THREE ARE EACH VERY SLIM READS YOU COULD READ ALL THREE WITHIN A WEEK A WEEKEND EVEN AFTER THAT THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD OF BOOKS
THIS DISCUSSION HAPPENS AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AND THERE'S EVEN AN INFOGRAPHIC COMPARING AND BRAVE NEW WORLD OUT THERE SOMEWHERE

I PERSONALLY THINK BRAVE NEW WORLD IS THE MOST UNNERVING AND RELEVANT PEOPLE ARE SO DISTRACTED BY SEX SHINY OBJECTS AND ENTERTAINMENT THAT THEY DON'T EVEN NOTICE THEY'RE BEING SUPPRESSED AND GETTING DUMBER JUST REPLACE THE REAL ORGIES WITH THE SOCIAL MEDIA VALIDATION ORGY THAT WE HAVE NOW

OF COURSE IS ALSO PRETTY DEAD ON IN SOME PLACES LIKE BIG GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE STATE CENSORSHIP ETC

ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION GOD BLESS YOU MR ROSEWATER BY KURT VONNEGUT MANY AMUSING OBSERVATIONS ON OUR WEIRD SOCIETY
THERE IS IN OUR FUTURE A TV OR INTERNET POPULISM IN WHICH THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE OF A SELECTED GROUP OF CITIZENS CAN BE PRESENTED AND ACCEPTED AS THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE

MADE ME STOP AND THINK THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING
OME THIS GUY IS A BEAST

THIS AMAZING QUOTE FROM
THERE IS IN OUR FUTURE A TV OR INTERNET POPULISM IN WHICH THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE OF A SELECTED GROUP OF CITIZENS CAN BE PRESENTED AND ACCEPTED AS THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE
EVEN BETTER IS HIS ESSAY ON PINBALL

YOU DON T PLAY PINBALL WITH JUST YOUR HANDS YOU PLAY IT WITH THE GROIN TOO THE PINBALL PROBLEM IS NOT TO STOP THE BALL BEFORE IT S SWALLOWED BY THE MOUTH AT THE BOTTOM OR TO KICK IT BACK TO MIDFIELD LIKE A HALFBACK THE PROBLEM IS TO MAKE IT STAY UP WHERE THE LIGHTED TARGETS ARE MORE NUMEROUS AND HAVE IT BOUNCE FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WANDERING CONFUSED DELIRIOUS BUT STILL A FREE AGENT AND YOU ACHIEVE THIS NOT BY JOLTING THE BALL BUT BY TRANSMITTING VIBRATIONS TO THE CASE THE FRAME BUT GENTLY SO THE MACHINE WONT CATCH ON AND SAY TILT YOU CAN ONLY DO IT WITH THE GROIN OR WITH A PLAY OF THE HIPS THAT MAKES THE GROIN NOT SO MUCH BUMP AS SLITHER KEEPING YOU ON THIS SIDE OF AN ORGASM AND IF THE HIPS MOVE ACCORDING TO NATURE IT S THE BUTTOCKS THAT SUPPLY THE FORWARD THRUST BUT GRACEFULLY SO THAT WHEN THE THRUST REACHES THE PELVIC AREA IT IS SOFTENED AS IN HOMEOPATHY WHERE THE MORE YOU SHAKE A SOLUTION AND THE MORE THE DRUG DISSOLVES IN THE WATER ADDED GRADUALLY UNTIL THE DRUG HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED THE MORE MEDICALLY EFFECTIVE AND POTENT IT IS THUS FROM THE GROIN AN INFINITESIMAL PULSE IS TRANSMITTED TO THE CASE AND THE MACHINE OBEYS THE BALL MOVES AGAINST NATURE AGAINST INERTIA AGAINST GRAVITY AGAINST THE LAW OF DYNAMICS AND AGAINST THE CLEVERNESS OF ITS CONSTRUCTOR WHO WANTED IT DISOBEDIENT THE BALL IS INTOXICATED WITH VIS MOVENDI REMAINING IN PLAY FOR MEMORABLE AND IMMEMORIAL LENGTHS OF TIME BUT A FEMALE GROIN IS REQUIRED ONE THAT INTERPOSES NO SPONGY BODY BETWEEN THE ILEUM AND THE MACHINE AND THERE MUST BE NO ERECTILE MATTER IN BETWEEN ONLY SKIN NERVES PADDED BONE SHEATHED IN A PAIR OF JEANS AND A SUBLIMATED EROTIC FURY A SLY FRIGIDITY A DISINTERESTED ADAPTABILITY TO THE PARTNER S RESPONSE A TASTE FOR AROUSING DESIRE WITHOUT SUFFERING THE EXCESS OF ONE S OWN THE AMAZON MUST DRIVE THE PINBALL CRAZY AND SAVOR THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WILL THEN ABANDON IT
OUTSTANDING ESSAY THE PART ABOUT SYNCRETISM IS GREAT

THIS NEW CULTURE HAD TO BE SYNCRETISTIC SYNCRETISM IS NOT ONLY AS THE DICTIONARY SAYS THE COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF BELIEF OR PRACTICE SUCH A COMBINATION MUST TOLERATE CONTRADICTIONS EACH OF THE ORIGINAL MESSAGES CONTAINS A SILVER OF WISDOM AND WHENEVER THEY SEEM TO SAY DIFFERENT OR INCOMPATIBLE THINGS IT IS ONLY BECAUSE ALL ARE ALLUDING ALLEGORICALLY TO THE SAME PRIMEVAL TRUTH

AS A CONSEQUENCE THERE CAN BE NO ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING TRUTH HAS BEEN ALREADY SPELLED OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL AND WE CAN ONLY KEEP INTERPRETING ITS OBSCURE MESSAGE

ONE HAS ONLY TO LOOK AT THE SYLLABUS OF EVERY FASCIST MOVEMENT TO FIND THE MAJOR TRADITIONALIST THINKERS THE NAZI GNOSIS WAS NOURISHED BY TRADITIONALIST SYNCRETISTIC OCCULT ELEMENTS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL THEORETICAL SOURCE OF THE THEORIES OF THE NEW ITALIAN RIGHT JULIUS EVOLA MERGED THE HOLY GRAIL WITH THE PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION ALCHEMY WITH THE HOLY ROMAN AND GERMANIC EMPIRE THE VERY FACT THAT THE ITALIAN RIGHT IN ORDER TO SHOW ITS OPEN-MINDEDNESS RECENTLY BROADENED ITS SYLLABUS TO INCLUDE WORKS BY DE MAISTER GUENON AND GRAMSCI IS A BLATANT PROOF OF SYNCRETISM

IF YOU BROWSE IN THE SHELVES THAT IN AMERICAN BOOKSTORES ARE LABELED AS NEW AGE YOU CAN FIND THERE EVEN SAINT AUGUSTINE WHO AS FAR AS I KNOW WAS NOT A FASCIST BUT COMBINING SAINT AUGUSTINE AND STONEHENGE THAT IS A SYMPTOM OF

THIS IS VERY INTERESTING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RIGHT-WING INTERNET MEME DISCUSSION THROUGH LENS THE COMBINATION OF AND IDEOLOGY IS ACTUALLY FASCIST AS FUCK
THIS IS PART OF A COLLECTION CALLED FIVE MORAL PIECES CHECK IT OUT SOME TIME
I LOVE UMBERTO ECO SO YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO GET EASY KARMA FROM ME I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY INTELLECTUALS WHO WERE SO CONSISTENTLY AS ECO THANKS FOR THE POST
FOR A MORE ACADEMIC APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF FASCISM ROBERT ANATOMY OF FASCISM IS THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO THE SUBJECT
HE'S A SEMIOLOGIST
WHAT'S A GOOD BOOK TO START ON IF I WANT TO READ MORE OF ECO I HAVE A COPY OF THE NAME OF THE ROSE BUT NEVER GOT AROUND TO READING IT
WHEREVER A POLITICIAN CASTS DOUBT ON THE LEGITIMACY OF A PARLIAMENT BECAUSE IT NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN SMELL
REMOVED
SADLY UMBERTO ECO IS ANOTHER VICTIM OF

RIP
IF YOU LIKED THIS ARTICLE YOU SHOULD TRY THE MYSTERIOUS FLAME OF QUEEN JOANA WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THIS ARTICLE IN EXTENDED FORMAT IT'S THE ONLY ECO I'VE READ THERE WERE BIZARRE MOMENTS AND THE PASTICHE WAS OVERWHELMING AT TIMES BUT OVERALL IT HAD A OF PLOT TO FOLLOW AND IT WASN'T TERRIBLY ESOTERIC READING THIS ARTICLE WAS LIKE SEEING ECO PLAY WITH THE SEEDLINGS THAT HE WOULD EVENTUALLY GROW INTO THE FOREST OF QUEEN JOANA
A FOLLOW UP TO THIS ESSAY IS IBN ISLAM THE MIDDLE EAST AND FASCISM IN WHICH WARRAM PIVOTING OFF ECO SHOWS HOW ISLAM MATCHES THE DESCRIBE BY ECO



THE MOST TELLING AND FUN PART ARE THOSE IN HERE WHO SEE THEMSELVES AS ABOVE THIS AND ARE MAKING SNIDE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THE LIBERALS OR THE RIGHT ARE SO DUMB AND TOTALLY



BUT I THINK THAT IS THE POINT ELEMENTS OF IT EXIST IN EVERY GROUP AS IT'S LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR IT'S REALLY TEMPTING TO ENGAGE IN THAT WAY METHODOLOGY BECAUSE IT IS REWARDING ON A VERY CORE LEVEL



WHILE I IMMEDIATELY ASSOCIATED MOST OF THESE POINTS AS ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT RIGHT ON SECOND THOUGHT I AM GLOSSING OVER SIMILARITIES WITH THE LEFT AND HOLES IN MY OWN BRAND OF THAT IDEOLOGY I SHOULD REFLECT AND CHECK MYSELF FROM FALLING INTO THE TRAITS OR PATTERNS ECO LAYS OUT



AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I TOOK FROM THE CLOSING PARAGRAPH








ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL SPECIALLY TODAY
BACK IN THE LATE S I WAS CHANGING PLANES IN THE DFW AIRPORT AND THEY PAGED UMBERTO ECO OR PERHAPS IT WAS ANOTHER GUY WITH THE SAME NAME

EITHER WAY SOMEONE REALLY WANTED A GUY NAMED UMBERTO ECO TO CALL FROM THE NEAREST WHITE COURTESY PHONE

I KNOW IT'S NOT RELATED TO THE ESSAY BUT I REMEMBER ECO AS A REALLY TOP NOTCH SORT OF THINKER I THOUGHT MAYBE IF I PAGED HIM WE COULD HAVE A COFFEE AND CHAT BUT I HAD A PLANE TO CATCH I ALSO SAW A GUY LUGGING A CESIUM CLOCK AROUND IN THE SAME AIRPORT AROUND THE SAME ERA STRANGE PLACE
WOW TRULY GREAT WRITING IS SUCH A JOY TO READ LOOK AT HOW HE STRUCTURES HIS SENTENCES AND THE BREAKING OF THE PARAGRAPHS
THIS IS A FANTASTIC ESSAY THANK YOU U CANDERSONNYC FOR POSTING IT
REALLY FANTASTIC ESSAY VERY RELEVANT TOO
WHITE PAGE WITH A WHITE SCROLL BAR WHO THE FUCK DESIGNED THAT SHIT
MENTIONED HERE TOO
I BARELY THINK I KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S GETTING AT JUST WANTED TO SAY ARE SOME SMART COOKIES
I ENJOYED THIS ARTICLE A LOT I LOVE WRITING AFTER I READ PENDULUM I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF FROM READING ALL OF HIS OTHER NOVELS

THIS IS ALSO AN UNEXPECTEDLY GOOD READ
THIS IS INCREDIBLY GOOD THE PART ABOUT CREATING NEW WORDS MADE ME STOP AND THINK
INTERESTING AND INSIGHTFUL BUT IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF WISHFUL THINKING TO CLAIM THE NAZIS WERE ANTI-CHRISTIAN THEY HAD GOD WITH US BELT BUCKLES FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
THIS PARAGRAPH NEAR THE END IS CHILLINGLY FAMILIAR

SPEAKS NEWSPEAK NEWSPEAK WAS INVENTED BY ORWELL IN AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF INGSOC ENGLISH SOCIALISM BUT ELEMENTS OF ARE COMMON TO DIFFERENT FORMS OF DICTATORSHIP ALL THE NAZI OR FASCIST SCHOOLBOOKS MADE USE OF AN IMPOVERISHED VOCABULARY AND AN ELEMENTARY SYNTAX IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE INSTRUMENTS FOR COMPLEX AND CRITICAL REASONING
NO HARM INTENDED WITH THIS BUT I READ THE ARTICLE AND IT SEEMS THAT ECO HAD A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR COMMUNISM I ALSO READ ON THE INTERNET THAT HE WANTED THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO TO BE TAUGHT AT SCHOOL
NOT SURE HOW MUCH I GOT OUT OF THIS I'VE STUDIED FASCISM EXTENSIVELY IN SCHOOL BUT I WOULD TRANSLATE BALUT UND BODEN AS BLOOD AND SOIL OR BLOOD AND GROUND AND I'D USE ERDE FOR EARTH IT MAY NOT TECHNICALLY BE INCORRECT EARTH HAS A DOUBLE MEANING BEING THE PLANET AND SOIL IN ENGLISH AND MAYBE ALSO GERMAN I'M RELATIVELY GOOD AT CONVERSATIONAL GERMAN BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IF YOU USE IT I'LL GET IT BUT JUST FOR CONTEXT IN TRANSLATION I MAKE THAT DISTINCTION
UNFORTUNATELY CRITERIA ARE SO VAGUE THEY CAN BE APPLIED TO ALMOST ANY ISM TAKE LIBERALISM

THIS NEW CULTURE HAD TO BE SYNCRETISTIC YES LIBERALISM TAKES ON PARTS OF FDR PARTS OF KENNEDY PARTS OF CLINTON ETC THEY DON'T EMBRACE THE WHOLE SET OF THEIR BELIEFS

2 TRADITIONALISM IMPLIES THE REJECTION OF MODERNISM YES THEY REJECT MODERN CAPITALISM INDUSTRIALISM MATERIALISM CORPORATIONS ETC AND WANT US TO REVERT TO A SIMPLER TIME OF SMALLER BUSINESSES LOCAL COLLECTIVES ORGANIC FARMING CONSUMING LESS RESOURCES PUTTING THE LAND AND ANIMALS ABOVE TO NEEDS OF HUMANS ETC

IRRATIONALISM ALSO DEPENDS ON THE CULT OF ACTION FOR ACTION S SAKE ACTION BEING BEAUTIFUL IN ITSELF IT MUST BE TAKEN BEFORE OR WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS REFLECTION THINKING IS A FORM OF EMASCULATION WHILE IT'S EASY TO PAINT CONSERVATIVES WITH THIS BRUSH IT APPLIES TO LIBERALS TOO SAWS DEMAND IMMEDIATE ACTION AND REPARATIONS WHENEVER THERE IS A PERCEIVED SLIGHT AND REFUSE TO REFLECT ON WHETHER OR NOT THEIR DEMANDS ARE REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF OTHER RIGHTS SUCH AS FREE SPEECH

NO SYNCRETISTIC FAITH CAN WITHSTAND ANALYTICAL CRITICISM THIS IS BASICALLY RESTATING IN A DIFFERENT WAY LIBERALS REFUSE ANY ANALYTICAL CRITICISM OF POLICIES LIKE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION OR UNRESTRICTED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION OR TRIGGER WARNINGS OR SAFE SPACES



DERIVES FROM INDIVIDUAL OR SOCIAL FRUSTRATION PRETTY MUCH LIBERALISM IN A NUTSHELL BUT EVERY ISM IF IT IS TO APPEAL TO SOMEONE MUST APPEAL TO THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE FRUSTRATED BY SOMETHING AND THE ISM OFFERS AN ANSWER TO IT



THE FOLLOWERS MUST FEEL HUMILIATED BY THE OSTENTATIOUS WEALTH AND FORCE OF THEIR ENEMIES THIS IS CERTAINLY MORE TRUE OF LIBERALS THAN CONSERVATIVES

FOR THERE IS NO STRUGGLE FOR LIFE BUT RATHER LIFE IS LIVED FOR STRUGGLE THUS PACIFISM IS TRAFFICKING WITH THE ENEMY IT IS BAD BECAUSE LIFE IS PERMANENT WARFARE AGAIN THIS APPLIES QUITE WELL TO LIBERALISM OR ALMOST ANY ISM THAT'S A MINORITY IT'S ALWAYS A CONSTANT STRUGGLE TO SPREAD YOUR ISM SAWS GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO FIND SOMETHING TO BE OFFENDED OVER WHITES AS A WHOLE CAN NEVER NOT BE RACIST TO A LIBERAL BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN THE STRUGGLE IS ENDED



IN SUCH A PERSPECTIVE EVERYBODY IS EDUCATED TO BECOME A HERO AGAIN LIBERALISM EVERYONE IS A THE BEST AT BEING THEMSELVES EVERYONE IS VALUED EVERYONE GETS A TROPHY



FOR HOWEVER INDIVIDUALS AS INDIVIDUALS HAVE NO RIGHTS AND THE PEOPLE IS CONCEIVED AS A QUALITY A MONOLITHIC ENTITY EXPRESSING THE COMMON WILLIAM THIS IS CERTAINLY FAR CLOSER TO HILLARY IT TAKES A VILLAGE THAN TO THE NOTION OF RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM

SPEAKS NEWSPEAK IT IS CERTAINLY THE LEFT THAT PUSHES PC SPEECH WHICH WHILE NOT NEWSPEAK IS CERTAINLY CLOSER TO IT THAN ANY SPEECH RESTRICTIONS CONSERVATIVES PROPOSE AS WIKIPEDIA SAYS THE AIM OF NEWSPEAK IS TO REMOVE ALL SHADES OF MEANING FROM LANGUAGE LEAVING SIMPLE CONCEPTS CERTAINLY BY LABELING ANY THOUGHT OR ARGUMENT WITH SIMPLE TERMS LIKE RACIST SEXIST XENOPHOBIC ETC YOU REDUCE COMPLEX POSITIONS TO EASY TO UNDERSTAND BLACK AND WHITE TERMS

ANYWAY ALL OF THE ABOVE ISN'T TO SAY THAT LIBERALISM IS ANY CLOSER TO FASCISM THAN CONSERVATISM IT'S TO SAY THAT ANY ISM PARTICULAR ONE THAT IS NOT WIDELY EMBRACED AND THUS IS AT ODDS WITH OTHER ISMS WILL DISPLAY SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS
SPEAKING OF ITALIANS WHO WROTE ABOUT FASCISM


EMILIO BUSSU AUTHOR OF AN EXCELLENT MEMOIR OF THE ALPINE FRONT IN WWI SARDINIAN BRIGADE ALSO WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THE RISE OF FASCISM IN ITALY POST WORLD WAR ROAD TO EXILE THE STORY OF A SARDINIAN PATRIOT


I NEED TO BUY AN ENGLISH COPY
THAT WAS A BRILLIANT READ THANKS FOR POSTING IT TIL ABOUT SYNCRETISM IN FASCISM
WHEREVER A POLITICIAN CASTS DOUBT ON THE LEGITIMACY OF A PARLIAMENT BECAUSE IT NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN SMELL
THE PART ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INTERNET MINDSET SIMILAR TO FASCISM WAS WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME LETS HOPE HISTORY ISN'T ON TRACK TO REPEAT ITSELF IN THE US WITH THE RAPIDLY GROWING POLARIZATION OF GROUPS THAT IDENTIFY AS INDIVIDUALS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THE NEW SPEAK OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS TRIGGERED MICROAGGRESSIONS ENTITLEMENT PRIVILEGE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON ITS AWESOME WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF FINALLY BUT EVERYDAY I FEEL MORE AND MORE LIKE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT IN ENTIRELY THE WRONG WAY
SO DOES LIBERAL FASCISM EXIST
I LOVE IT WHEN LIBERALS OR CONSERVATIVES LOSE AN ELECTION THEN THERE'S A SUDDEN BURST OF THEM READING UP ON TOPICS OF FASCISM SO THEY CAN AT LEAST HAVE SOME HONESTY IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY ARE YELLING ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE UNFORTUNATELY IT ONLY LASTS A FEW WEEKS AND THEY GET DISCOURAGED AND SUFFER MASSIVE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE WHEN THEY REALIZE MOST OF WHAT THEY ARE READING ABOUT FASCISM CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR OWN THOUGHTS AND POLITICISE
DAMN COMMENTING SO I CAN PICK THIS UP AGAIN LATER
WHEREVER A POLITICIAN CASTS DOUBT ON THE LEGITIMACY OF A PARLIAMENT BECAUSE IT NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN SMELL

EXCEPT YOU KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS A POLITICAL SMELL DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT ALSO CAN'T BE THE THING WE SUPPOSE IT TO BE

LETS NOT FALL FOR THE FALLACY OF THE EXCLUDED MIDDLE

EDIT WORDS
AS THE DEGENERACY OF CAPITALISM IS NOW IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE I THINK FASCISM NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN AS THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT WORKS

I DON'T THINK THIS IS R OUTSTANDINGESSAYS IT IS R BOOKS
MORE IRRELEVANT TODAY THAN EVER
IF SOMEONE'S ANALYSIS OF A POLITICAL MOVEMENT OR IDEOLOGY COMPRISES NO LESS THAN BROAD FEATURES WHICH TYPIFY IT YOU CAN BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE FAILED UTTERLY TO UNDERSTAND IT
REMOVED
GOOD READ EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
HELLO SORRY FOR BED ENGLAND
LEFTIES WOULD DO WELL TO READ THIS THE INCREASING USE OF LAWS TO STOP PEOPLE EXPRESSING THEMSELVES IS A REAL WORRY
I STILL READ MAINLY WHITE AUTHORS BUT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SPREAD OUT THE VIEWPOINTS I'M TAKING IN A BIT AND HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY PICKING UP MORE BOOKS BY NONWHITE AUTHORS OF BOOKS WERE BY AUTHORS WHO ARE NOT WHITE AND OF THE BOOKS ON MY PILE ON MY COFFEE TABLE ARE BY NONWHITE AUTHORS IS TRANSLATED FROM KOREAN
WHAT AM I AN ACCOUNTANT
I WAS WONDERING THE SAME THING EARLIER THIS YEAR SO I TOOK A TALLY AND CAME UP WITH ABOUT WOMEN AND FOREIGN OR MINORITY AUTHORS ONLY ONE GBT BOOK THIS YEAR MEANT TO DO MORE BUT GOT CAUGHT UP IN OTHER BUSINESS

OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS SOME JUDGMENT INVOLVED AND THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW MUCH IT MATTERS ONE OF THE AUTHORS I'M READING NOW DAN CLARK IS A US CITIZEN BORN IN JAPAN TO A JAPANESE MOTHER BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WHEN I STARTED THE BOOK AND HIS HERITAGE ISN'T A BIG PART OF THE STORY IF I WERE TO GIVE HIM A LABEL TV STAR ATHLETE AND ADDICT WOULD COME WELL BEFORE ASIAN AMERICAN
BECAUSE I'M NOT WHITE

I DID READ SOME AUTHORS OF COLOR AS WELL BUT NEVER MY COLOR

I'VE DEFINITELY READ SOME TRANSLATIONS THIS YEAR THOUGH I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THEM I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I'M MISSING SOMETHING BY READING A TRANSLATION BUT ENGLISH IS THE ONLY LANGUAGE I CAN READ I CAN SPEAK OTHERS
NO IDEA I'M MORE CONCERNED WITH WHETHER OR NOT A BOOK SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD READ THAN I AM WITH THE SEX OR THE ETHNICITY OF THE AUTHOR I DON'T EVEN CHECK THE AUTHOR'S BIO UNLESS I'VE FINISHED THE BOOK AND AM INTERESTED IN FINDING MORE FROM THEM

SO IT COULD BE OR IT COULD BE LOOKING AT THE AUTHORS WHOSE WORKS I'VE DEVOURED THIS YEAR IT'S SOMEWHERE IN THERE

IT'S A MEANINGLESS STATISTIC THANKFULLY AS ANYONE CAN WRITE A GOOD BOOK REGARDLESS OF SEX OR UPBRINGING
AROUND BY POC BY WOMEN
WELL IM SWEDISH AND I READ BOOKS IN ENGLISH BY AUTHORS WHO HAVE BOOKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH THEIR ETHNICITY OR OTHER GROUP BELONGING HAS NO IMPORTANCE TO ME

IT CAN BE A TRANSGENDER GAY CHINESE DWARF FOR ALL I CARE I CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY WRITE
NOT SURE ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE BUT I'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH MARQUEZ BORGES AND BOLAN IN SPANISH MY WIFE IS FROM ARGENTINA SO I'VE BEEN STUDYING SPANISH SINCE WE GOT MARRIED WORDS SEEM TO STICK WITH ME WHEN I READ THEM IN THEIR CONTEXT RATHER THAN ON NOTE CARDS
I READ THE BOOKS THAT I FIND INTERESTING I'M A SUCKER FOR A GOOD STORY BUT IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT OF BOOKS I'VE READ THIS YEAR ARE BY WHITE MEN IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING THOSE ARE JUST THE BOOKS I'M INTERESTED IN
LIKE

I APPLAUD YOU FOR WANTING TO REACH OUT AND EXPERIENCE NEW AND DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES NOT SURE WHY THAT IS TOUGH THOUGH
GOOD QUESTION IT MADE ME CURIOUS ABOUT MY STATS FOR THE YEAR I'M AT

NON-WHITE

EITHER NON-WHITE OR NOT ORIGINALLY IN ENGLISH

WOMEN

I HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN MAKING AN EFFORT THIS YEAR TO ADD SOME DIVERSITY TO MY READING BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS HARD LET'S SEE IF I CAN DO BETTER NEXT YEAR
IF MANGA COUNTS MORE THAN IF NOT PROBABLY SOMETHING LOW I READ UNDERGROUND RAILROAD BY COLSON WHITEHEAD I REALLY HOPE THAT ISN'T THE ONLY BLACK AUTHOR I READ THIS YEAR I WOULD FEEL SUPER WHITE BECAUSE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD IS THE BOOK ALL WHITE PEOPLE SAY THEY READ THIS YEAR TO SOUND CULTURED

EDIT I JUST RECALLED I READ THE CHINESE SCI-FI TRILOGY THE THREE BODY PROBLEM OVER THE SUMMER IT WAS COOL SEEING THE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT BIRTH RESTRICTION LAWS AND ACT LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS STUPID FOR NOT HAVING THEM TOO
I STARTED KEEPING A SPREADSHEET A FEW YEARS AGO FOR THIS WHEN I STARTED IN I WAS WORSE OFF THAN WHERE YOU ARE AUTHORS OF COLOUR NON-AMERICAN FEMALE SUBOPTIMAL TO SAY THE LEAST

I'VE READ BOOKS IN SO FAR CURRENTLY I'M AT FEMALE AUTHORS OF COLOUR NON-AMERICAN I'M FINISHING UP THREE BOOKS SIMULTANEOUSLY RIGHT NOW THAT ARE BY NON-WHITE NON-AMERICAN AUTHORS AND TWO OF THEM ARE BY FEMALE AUTHORS SO THAT WILL BRING THE NUMBERS UP A BIT MORE

MY GOAL IS TO BE M F AMERICAN NON WHITE OC FOR

ONCE YOU START PAYING ATTENTION IT GETS EASIER AS YOU GO THE FIRST PART IS HARD BUT AS YOU DISCOVER NEW AREAS AND GENRES THAT YOU LIKE IT'S A LOT MORE SATISFYING THE HARDEST THING FOR ME IS STILL READING JUST AS A FACTOR OF WHERE I LIVE

FOR I THINK MY CHALLENGE TO MYSELF WILL BE TO CUT OUT WHITE AMERICAN MALE AUTHORS OR AT LEAST NOT INCLUDE THEM IN MY READING GOAL FOR THE YEAR IT'S JUST SO EASY TO FALL INTO THEM AND I WANT TO BREAK THE HABIT
THAT I KNOW OF I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING THROUGH ALL THE BOOKS I READ TO SEE IF THE AUTHOR IS WHITE OR NOT
SINCE I STARTED COUNTING MY BOOKS IN MID-MAY AND IGNORING BOOKS WHICH WERE
LOOKING AT MY LIST FOR THIS YEAR IT LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY BOOKS I READ BY SOMEONE WHO WASN'T A WHITE AMERICAN OR BRITISH PERSON WERE SAPIENS A BRIEF HISTORY OF HUMANKIND BY YUVAL NOAH HARARI AND A WILD SHEEP CHASE BY HARUKI MURAKAMI

THAT'S 2 OUT OF BOOKS WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE GRAPHIC NOVELS I'VE READ THIS YEAR AS WELL
I'VE READ BOOKS SO FAR THIS YEAR AND AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON A BRIEF HISTORY OF SEVEN KILLINGS BY THE BLACK JAMAICAN AUTHOR MARLON JAMES

AUTHORS WHO ARE NOT WHITE

THINGS FALL APART BY CHINUA ACHEBE
THE AUTOGRAPH MAN BY ADIE SMITH
TWO YEARS EIGHT MONTHS AND TWENTY-EIGHT NIGHTS BY SALMAN RUSHDIE

PENDULUM BY UMBERTO ECO
LOOK WHO'S BACK BY TIMUR VERMES

HONOURABLE MENTIONS FOR LLOYD JONES AUTHOR OF MISTER PIP FROM NEW ZEALAND AND TWO OR THREE OF THE ILLUSTRATORS WHO WORKED ON GRAPHIC NOVELS I READ

SO I'M JUST OVER ON WHITE ENGLISH SPEAKING AUTHORS PRETTY SIMILAR TO YOU I GAVE ALL OF THE ABOVE AT LEAST THREE STARS ON GOODREADS SO THEY MAY BE WORTH YOU LOOKING INTO IF THERE ARE ANY YOU HAVEN'T READ
UNLESS I LIKE THE WORKS OF THE AUTHOR ENOUGH TO FOLLOW THEIR BLOG AND OR LOOK THEM UP ON WIKIPEDIA ALL I HAVE TO GO BY REGARDING THEIR ETHNICITY IS THEIR NAME WHICH REALLY ISN'T MUCH AS A RESULT I REALLY DONT HAVE ANY PARTICULAR IDEA ABOUT THIS
THAT SAID SINCE I'M INDIAN AROUND OF WHAT I READ IS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE OF A DIFFERENT ETHNICITY
I NEVER REALLY CONSIDER THIS AN ISSUE IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE HOW PEOPLE DISCUSS IT AND SEE AUTHORS MENTIONED THAT ARE OFFERING OTHER PERSPECTIVES BUT I CAN'T SAY I'D EVER EVEN CONSIDER THIS A DRIVING FORCE TOWARDS READING A CERTAIN TEXT
NOT MANY THIS YEAR UNFORTUNATELY I DO LOVE READING DIVERSELY THOUGH AND HAVE BOOKS ON MY SHELF OR ON MY WISELIEST THAT WOULD FIT THE BILL
I ONLY READ ABOUT FROM TRANSLATIONS THIS YEAR BUT A FEW YEARS
AGO I READ ABOUT TRANSLATIONS FOR THAT YEAR IT MUST HAVE BEEN
OF WHAT I READ
I MADE A BIT OF AN EFFORT TO READ SOME BOOKS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE BUT I HAD A LOT OF BOOKS I WANTED TO READ THIS YEAR SO AFTER A FEW I KIND OF FORGOT OUT OF THE BOOKS I'VE READ THIS YEAR THE FOLLOWING WERE TRANSLATED

THE MAGIC OF TIDYING UP BY MARIE KONDO A BOOK ABOUT THROWING AWAY MOST OF YOUR STUFF

THE VEGETARIAN BY HAN KANG A SHORT HORROR NOVEL

PAPRIKA BY YASUTAKA TSUTSUTSI A SURREAL SCI-FI NOVEL ABOUT LUCID DREAMING THERE'S A REALLY GREAT ANIME FILM BASED OFF IT
AUTHORS FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTRY BUT
AUTHORS FROM COUNTRIES THAT SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THAN ME AKA NOT ENGLISH
DIFFERENT RACE
BY MEN

I DON'T REALLY PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO WHERE THE AUTHORS ARE FROM WHEN I'M LOOKING FOR BOOKS SO IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT TURNED OUT I ALSO READ A LOT OF SCI-FI FANTASY SO IT DOESN'T ALWAYS EFFECT THE SETTING OF THE BOOK OR ANYTHING I'M THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO DO THE READ AROUND THE WORLD THING SO I READ MORE BOOKS BY AUTHORS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE PROCESS
OUT OF BOOKS READ SO FAR

BY WOMEN AUTHORS

I'VE READ BOOKS SO FAR THIS YEAR OF THEM BY WOMEN AND BY POC ONLY WERE TRANSLATED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL LANGUAGE
JAPANESE BOOKS TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH ABOUT MANGA JAPANESE COMIC AND LIGHT NOVEL SPECIAL VERSION OF A NOVEL TRANSLATED FROM JAPANESE TO ENGLISH

I THINK THE INTERESTING STUFF WHEN READING BOOKS FROM OTHER CULTURE IS THAT THEY GOT OTHER IDEAS OR APPROACHES AT THINGS AND BECAUSE OF THIS YOU CAN FIND INTERESTING PLOTS
I'VE BEEN MAKING A BIG EFFORT TO READ BOOKS BY AUTHORS WHO EITHER AREN'T WHITE OR WERE ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH

BUT WHY WHAT'S YOUR MOTIVE YOUR GOAL
I READ ULYSSES BY JAMES JOYCE AND CHELSEA HORROR HOTEL BY DEE DEE RAMONE ARE THOSE BOOKS THE SAME PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE BY WHITE DUDES I'M CONFUSED
NO IDEA I DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO AN AUTHOR'S COLOR CREED NATIONALITY OR SEX AND I THINK DOING SO OR BUYING A BOOK BECAUSE OH SOME JAPANESE BISEXUAL WROTE THIS OR OH SOME AMERICAN WHITE GUY WROTE THIS IS PRETTY SILLY AND FEELS LIKE JUST SOMETHING YOU CAN SAY AT DINNER PARTIES TO SOUND SUPER LIBERAL ETC I DUNNO MY FAVORITE AUTHOR AT THE MOMENT IS A DIFFERENT SEX TO ME IF THAT MEANS ANYTHING
WTF THEY'RE EVEN TRYING TO MAKE R BOOKS MORE DIVERSE NOW
WHILE THE DIFFICULTY OF MILTON CAN BE INTERPRETED A AS A MATTER OF KNOWLEDGE I TEND TO FEEL IT'S A MATTER OF STYLE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU'VE READ BEFORE PARADISE LOST IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO READ

WITH THAT IN MIND I WOULD JUST DIVE IN BUT READING IT OUT LOUD MIGHT BE THE THING THAT KEEPS YOU GETTING THROUGH IT EACH BOOK IS ABOUT LONG OR READ SO NOT TOO MUCH EVEN IF YOU DON'T GET IT AT LEAST YOU'VE SEEN AND HEARD ALL THE WORDS AND YOU CAN START TO GET ON WITH IT
IT DEFINITELY IS A MATTER OF KNOWLEDGE AS MUCH AS STYLE THE DIFFERENCE IS HOWEVER THAT YOU CAN GET USED TO THE HILTONS STYLE WITH TIME AND EFFORT THE GAP IN KNOWLEDGE CAN'T BE BRIDGED BY A MORE CONCENTRATED READING BECAUSE THE ANSWERS LIE EMBEDDED ELSEWHERE IN THIRD PARTY LITERATURE AND HISTORICAL TRADITIONS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND AN OVERT REFERENCE THEN YOU JUST WON'T GET MUCH OF PLURAL THERE IS ALSO THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW AND HENCE YOU WILL BE COMPLETELY UNAWARE THAT THE COVERT OR LAYERED MEANINGS ARE THERE AT ALL

THEREFORE IF YOU'RE WORRIED THAT A LACK OF BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE IS GOING TO CUT YOU OFF FROM BETTER UNDERSTANDING IT TRY PICKING UP A COPY OF THE NORTON CRITICAL EDITION IT CONTAINS A HUGE NUMBER OF FOOTNOTES THAT EXPLAIN NUANCES IN THE TEXT SUCH AS ALLUSIONS TO THE GREEK EPICS BIBLICAL HISTORY AND PASSAGES MEANING OF WORDS EG LIST MEANS WISH SUBLIMED MEANS VAPORISED EQUALED MEANS KILLED ETC AND REARRANGES THE SYNTAX OF IMPORTANT LINES TO MAKE THE MEANING CLEARER AMONG OTHER USEFUL THINGS
FOREWORD TO THIS EDITION AND INTRODUCTION USUALLY FOUND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK
IF I'M EMBARKING ON SOMETHING EPIC I MIGHT READ THE CLIFF NOTES OR AT LEAST KEEP IT HANDY WHILST I READ IT I NEVER USED TO DO THIS BUT I GOT ABOUT PAGES INTO PARADISE LOST AND FELT LIKE I DIDN'T GET IT MY HUSBAND REALLY ENJOYS MILTON AND I FELT LIKE I WAS MISSING OUT

U KEMPFF S COMMENTS ARE SPOT ON FOR WHEN YOU BEGIN READING THE BOOK DON'T SAVE THE INTRODUCTION AND FORWARD FOR LAST

GOING DEEPER I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU TRY LYCIDAS FIRST WHICH IS A NICE SHORT HOUR OR LESS READ INDICATIVE OF STYLE IF YOU LIKE HIS STYLE I WOULD RETURN THE COPY OF PARADISE LOST YOU GOT AND GET AN ACADEMIC VERSION WITH FOOTNOTES

THERE ARE MANY REFERENCES IN PARADISE LOST THAT REQUIRE PRECISE HISTORICAL OR CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS AROUND THAT TIME IN ORDER TO JUST JUMP INTO IT YOU'D NEED TO PREPARE YOURSELF TO UNDERSTAND A WIDE RANGE OF REFERENCES THAT CAN TOUCH ON THEOLOGY POLITICS AND THE GENERAL HISTORY OF THE TIME A DAUNTING TASK TO RESEARCH INDIVIDUALLY

AN ACADEMIC VERSION WITH FOOTNOTES WILL MAKE THE READ MORE PLEASURABLE AS YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO STOP AS OFTEN TO FIGURE OUT SPECIFIC REFERENCES
THE BIBLE AND SHAKESPEARE HOPE THAT'S NOT INTIMIDATING
THE THING I REMEMBER MOST ABOUT ALCOTT FROM READING VARIOUS BIOGRAPHIES OF HER WAS THAT HER DAD WAS SO INFLUENCED BY THE TRANSCENDENTAL MOVEMENT THAT THEY DID A LOT OF FARMING IN FANCY COMMUNES AND WERE VEGAN THE FATHER ALSO ESCHEWED MOST FORMS OF PAID EMPLOYMENT SO THE WOMEN OF THE FAMILY HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO FIND JOBS TO KEEP THE FAMILY GOING OH AND SHE WROTE WITH A STEEL PEN NOT SURE WHY THAT TIDBIT REMAINS IN MY HEAD
LITTLE WOMEN IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS I FIRST READ A PART OF IT IN AN ANTHOLOGY OF STORIES FOR GIRLS AND ABOUT YEARS AGO STARTED REREADING IT YEARLY AROUND CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR I WILL BE READING THE ANNOTATED ANTHOLOGY AND AM A LITTLE TOO EXCITED ABOUT IT ODDLY ENOUGH I HAVEN'T READ THE SEQUELS THOUGH I ONCE LOOKED UP PLOT SUMMARIES OF THEM I FEEL LIKE THEY WON'T HOLD UP TO THE ORIGINAL

I READ LOUISA MAY ALCOTT THE WOMAN BEHIND LITTLE WOMEN A FEW YEARS BACK AND IT WAS VERY INTERESTING READING THE PARALLELS BETWEEN HER REAL LIFE AND JO IN THE BOOKS I WAS SURPRISED HER UPBRINGING WAS SO AUSTERE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY HER FATHER WAS SO SET IN HIS WAYS HE BROUGHT HIS FAMILY TO THE BRINK OF STARVATION A COUPLE TIMES IT'S NO WONDER THAT SHE WROTE A HOME THAT WAS A MORE WARM JOYFUL PLACE
DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK
LITTLE WOMEN CAN TRACE ITS ORIGINS TO THE BRONTE SISTERS
I LOVE FINDING WEIRD STUFF IN BOOKS THE STRANGEST THING WAS A LETTER FOLDED UP INSIDE AN OLD BOTANY BOOK I FOUND IN A PARK A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS ONLY A FEW LINES OF SEEMINGLY RANDOM WORDS THEN SOME NUMBERS UNDERNEATH I WAS CONVINCED IT WAS SOME SORT OF CODE INTRIGUING
NOT WEIRD BUT SUPER FUN

I FOUND THE FENMAN LECTURES SET FOR MY BOYFRIEND AT A USED BOOKSELLER WHEN WE LOOKED INSIDE SOMEONE HAD BEEN WRITING NOTES IN THE MARGINS AS THEY LEARNED THE BOOKSELLER TOLD US IT WAS FROM A DONATED COLLECTION AFTER ONE OF HIS CLIENTS HAD PASSED I LIKE TO IMAGINE AN OLD MAN SELF-TEACHING HIMSELF PHYSICS IN HIS LIVING ROOM
IT ISN'T QUITE STRANGE BUT ONE OF MY MOST LOVED AND HATED IS A CARD THAT ADVERTISES AN ESCAPIST SUPPORT GROUP IT FRUSTRATES THE HELL OUT OF ME THAT IT WAS IN A BOOK BUT I MEAN I UNDERSTAND IT
IS IT THAT WEIRD BEFORE CELLPHONES BECAME UBIQUITOUS YOU'D WRITE A PERSON'S NUMBER DOWN
WEIRDEST WAS A TORONTO STAR ARTICLE FROM YEARS EARLIER TUCKED INTO A BOOK WHICH WAS TALKING ABOUT AN OLD STARCH PLANT THAT'S DOWN THE ROAD FROM WHERE I LIVED I BOUGHT THIS BOOK IN A FAR DIFFERENT AREA THAN WHERE I LIVE AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE ARTICLE UNTIL I GOT HOME AND STARTED RIFLING THROUGH THE PAGES
RECENTLY I'VE FOUND A LAMINATED IN MEMORIA CARD INSIDE A BOOK ABOUT SHAKESPEARE ALSO FOUND A PLANE TICKET STUB FROM SAN FRAN TO MEXICO ONCE FOUND A STRIP OF PHOTO BOOTH PICS OF SOME HS GIRLS IN A COPY OF INFINITE JEST
I FOUND A RECIPE FOR RUM RAISIN TIRAMISU INSIDE A LIBRARY COPY OF RON BIOGRAPHY OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON I MADE THE TIRAMISU IT WAS FINE ALTHOUGH I'D BEEN HOPING IT'D IMBUE ME WITH SOME OF BETTER QUALITIES WHICH IT DIDN'T

A RECEIPT FOR CONDOMS INSIDE A DR SUESS BOOK THE BORAX THAT I BOUGHT FOR A FRIEND'S KID THANKFULLY IT WAS JUST THE RECEIPT AND NOT LIKE A WRAPPER OR SOMETHING
I FOUND A DOLLAR BILL IN MY LIBRARY BOOK
MY EX ONCE ORDERED A USED BOOK ON HAVING A GBT CHILD AND IT HAD INSIDE SOME LONG EMOTIONAL LETTER THAT THE ORIGINAL OWNER HAD WRITTEN TO THEIR PARENTS TO GIVE THEM WITH THE BOOK
I LIKE IT WHEN THE ORIGINAL RECEIPT IS IN THE BOOK BUS TICKETS ARE GOOD TOO ONCE I FOUND AN OVERDUE NOTICE FROM THE LIBRARY THE BOOK ORIGINALLY CAME FROM
I HAVE YET TO COME ACROSS ANYTHING FROM ANY OF THE USED BOOKS I'VE BOUGHT THOUGH I HAVE LEFT THINGS IN BOOKS LIKE ON MY LAST DAY AT UNI BEFORE GRADUATING I WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND SLIPPED A POEM INTO A PSYCHOLOGY BOOK IN A TRIBUTE TO MY FIRST MAJOR BEFORE I SWITCHED COURSES
I LOVE SHOPPING FOR BOOKS AT GOODWILL AND WHENEVER I SEE SOME RANDOM PAPER STICKING OUT OF THE TOP BINDING I'LL TAKE A GLANCE AT IT I ONCE FOUND A USED DIARY WITH A BUNCH OF ENTRIES STILL WRITTEN IN ABOUT A WOMAN WITH WEIGHT EATING ISSUES WRITING ABOUT HER UNREQUITED LOVE TO HER SO HUSBAND BF I'M NOT SURE NAMED FRANK I DEBATED ON BUYING IT AND I DIDN'T HAVE MY PHONE ON MY TO TAKE PHOTOS IT WASN'T THERE THE NEXT TIME I WENT BACK

I ALWAYS FLIP THROUGH THE FIRST PAGES OF BOOKS I PICK UP TO SEE IF I CAN FIND A SIGNED COPY AND THERE ARE LOTS OF WRITTEN DEDICATIONS THAT ARE QUITE ENDEARING FROM FRIENDS OR PARENTS MOST ARE DATED

R FOUNDPAPER IS A GREAT BROWSE FOR THIS KINDA STUFF BUT IT'S NOT USUALLY SPECIFIED WHERE THEY FOUND IT
I'VE FOUND BOARDING PASSES COUPONS DRY CLEANING TICKETS GROCERY SHOPPING LISTS AND PRESSED FLOWERS THE CREEPIEST THING I EVER FOUND WAS A RECEIPT FROM A SEX TOY PLACE IN A COPY OF NIGHTS OF SODOM
NEEDLESS TO SAY I PRACTICALLY WASHED THAT BOOK IN PURCELL
A PRESCRIPTION DATED
IT'S TAKEN OFF A LOT THIS YEAR

IT WAS DRIVEN BY AUTHORS ON AMAZON AT FIRST WITHOUT PUBLICITY OR MARKETING THEY'D HAVE WITH A PUBLISHER THEY NEEDED ALL THEY COULD TO HELP MAKE THEIR BOOK STAND OUT AND THEY REALISED THAT YOU COULD TECHNICALLY PUT ANYTHING YOU WANTED IN THE BOOK TITLE SECTION IT'S SOMETHING THAT TRADITIONAL PUBLISHING HOUSES NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT AS ALL OF THEIR BOOK TITLES FEED THROUGH FROM WHATEVER PUBLISHING SYSTEM THEY'RE USING SO OF COURSE IT'S JUST THE TITLE AS WHY WOULD THE EDITOR THINK TO PUT ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT IN THEIR SYSTEM

MEANWHILE ON AMAZON YOU STARTED TO GET THESE CLUMSY BEST THRILLER EVER AD LINES STUCK ONTO THE END OF BOOK TITLES IT SEEMS CHEAP AND OBVIOUS BUT THEN IT STARTS TO WORK THERE'S A BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT BUY LOTS AND LOTS OF BOOKS BUT ONLY IF THEY'RE REALLY CHEAP AND THEY JUST SKIM THROUGH AMAZON LISTS LIKE LOOKING AT GROCERIES A BOOK IS JUST ANOTHER PRODUCT FEW OF THEM CAN BE BOTHERED TO CLICK THROUGH AND READ MORE THEY NEED A TITLE AND BOOK JACKET THAT LOOKS COMPELLING AND A DECENT IDEA OF WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT AND IT'S 2 OF COURSE I'LL GET THAT ONE OVER THE

SO SUDDENLY YOU'VE GOT THIS SPLIT A FLOOD OF 2 BOOKS ON AMAZON THAT TELL YOU RIGHT THERE IN THE TITLE WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT AND HOW GREAT THEY ARE MEANWHILE THE TRADITIONALLY PUBLISHED ARE BEING PRICED SIMILARLY TO PHYSICAL EDITIONS PUBLISHERS SHIFTED TO A NEW PAYMENT MODEL OVER THE LAST YEAR SO THEY CAN CONTROL PRICES ESSENTIALLY TO TRY AND COMBAT AMAZON'S SEVERE OF BUT IT'S SHUTTING THE GATE AFTER THE HORSE HAS BOLTED AND THEY AREN'T OPTIMISING THE TITLES TO BE STYLE SO OF COURSE THE AMAZON TOP BOOKS LIST STARTS TO BE DOMINATED BY THESE CHEAP BOOKS

FINALLY THIS YEAR TRADITIONAL PUBLISHERS HAVE STARTED CATCHING ONTO THIS TECHNIQUE AND ARE NOW IMITATING IT WITH THESE BLATANT AD LINES ADDED TO BOOK TITLES SO THAT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT JUST SKIM THROUGH AMAZON BOOKS THEY'LL CATCH THEIR EYE

SO ESSENTIALLY IT'S NOT FOR YOU IT'S FOR THE BOOK BUYER WHO USED TO BUY BOOKS AT THE SUPERMARKET BECAUSE IT WAS 2 FOR AND IT SOUNDED NICE AND WAS CHEAP

SO PREVIOUSLY YOU COULD HAVE PRESUMED IT MEANT THE BOOK WAS AT THE LOWER QUALITY END BUT NOW IT'S USED BY ALL PUBLISHERS TOO GRANTED IT'S ONLY USED ON THE POPULAR FICTION END OF THE MARKET SO YOU MAY NOT BE INTERESTED IN THAT MARKET ANYWAY YOU WON'T SEE BEST BOOK EVER ADDED TO THE END OF TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD BUT IT'S NOT AUTOMATICALLY A SIGN OF POOR QUALITY IT'S A SIGN OF HOW THE BOOK MARKET CURRENTLY WORKS ON AMAZON
I THINK THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BOOKS MARKETED LIKE THIS AT LEAST SINCE THE ANYWAY THEY TEND TO NOT BE VERY GOOD
ANYTHING THAT HAS TO ADVERTISE ITSELF IN THE TITLE HAS GOT TO BE ABSOLUTELY AWFUL RIGHT

TOTALLY AGREE THAT IT MAKES THEM SEEM DESPERATE THE HARDER THEY ARE TRYING TO GET ME TO BUY SOMETHING THE LESS LIKELY I AM TO DO SO
I HAVEN'T NOTICED THIS BUT I CAN'T REALLY SAY I'M SURPRISED
JUST HAVEN'T MET YOU YET HAD THE MOST CRINGEWORTHY DESCRIPTION OF THE ONES YOU PICTURED

I FEEL LIKE IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING MORE IN THE PAST YEAR OR SO TOO WITH HOW CHEAP THE BOOKS ARE AND PROGRAMS LIKE KINDLE UNLIMITED AND KINDLE FIRST A LOT OF BOOKS ARE GETTING A TON OF REVIEWS AND ARE BEING BUMPED UP IN TOP LISTS IF I'M JUST BROWSING FOR NEW BOOKS I'LL READ THE DESCRIPTION A COUPLE REVIEWS CHECK GOODREADS WHICH I TRUST MORE THAN AMAZON REVIEWS OR DOWNLOAD A SAMPLE TO TRY AND GET AROUND IT

EDIT ALSO IF YOU HAVE GOODREADS YOU CAN SET UP EMAIL ALERTS FOR BOOK DEALS I LIMITED IT TO BESTSELLERS OR THINGS ON MY LIST AND HAVE GOTTEN ABOUT BOOKS FOR OR
HI ARE YOU INTERESTED IN OTHER GENRES TO READ
I GET EMAILS FROM BOOKBUB AND I REGULARLY SEARCH AMAZON BASED ON THE BOOKBUB RECOMMENDATIONS FOR E BOOKS TOO I'VE BOUGHT SOME FROM BB ALMOST ALL GARBAGE AND CHEAP OR FREE POOR FICTION HISTORY AND COOKBOOKS SEEM MORE LEGIT BUT I HAVE FOUND SO MANY CHEAP BOOKS ALL BY SELF PUBLISHERS THAT LEAVE ME UTTERLY SURPRISED ANYONE WOULD FALL FOR THEIR GARBAGE AND WHAT'S SURPRISING IS THEY HAVE HUNDREDS OF REVIEWS GENERALLY GOOD LIKE STARS AND ABOVE YET I CAN TELL EVEN THROUGH THE REVIEWERS THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD LITERATURE IS YOU KNOW SHORT THIS WAS AMAZING CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE HARDLY ANY SERIOUS LITERARY REVIEWS GOODREADS IS A GOOD SOURCE TO CHECK OUT REAL REVIEWS
WE WON'T DISCOVER WHICH BOOKS OF THE CENTURY WERE WORTH READING FOR SEVERAL MORE DECADES SO I TEND TO FOCUS ON BOOKS BEFORE THAT HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND OBVIOUS BUT THE DISCWORLD WAS MY SECOND HOME FOR YEARS
MAN ITS GOTTA BE ROBIN SERIES THE ASSASSIN APPRENTICE
SCOTT GENTLEMEN BASTARD SERIES PARTICULARLY THE FIRST ONE THE LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA CURRENTLY RATES AS MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME

THE WORLD ITSELF IS INTERESTING SUBVERTING MANY FANTASY TROPES AND PRESENTING A FRESH TAKE ON DARK FANTASY BUT WHAT REALLY TAKES THE CAKE IN THIS SERIES IMO IS THE CHARACTERS EVERY CHARACTER WALKS TALKS AND ACTS LIKE REAL HUMAN BEINGS IN THAT RESPECTIVE SITUATION YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN IN MORE CLASSIC FANTASY EVERYTHING HAS SORT OF THIS TETRICAL VEIL TO IT LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN FOR A STAGE PLAY OR A MOVIE THAT QUALITY OF YEAH NOBODY ACTUALLY TALKS OR ACTS LIKE THAT LYNCH IS MORE IN LINE WITH MORE MODERN WRITING LIKE ROTHFUSS OR SCALZI YOU GET THE FEELING THAT IF MAGIC WAS REAL AND THAT WORLD EXISTED SO WOULD THOSE PEOPLE THE CHARACTERS ARE INTERESTING AND FLAWED WITHOUT DESCENDING INTO CARICATURES OR CHARACTER IT HAS THAT VERY REAL QUALITY OF EVEN THE LOWEST CHARACTER HAVING QUALITIES AND EVEN THE BEST BEING FLAWED AND IT HELPS THAT THE SCHEMES ARE ENDLESSLY ENTERTAINING AND OFTEN QUITE CLEVER

SO YEAH IF YOU LIKE FANTASY PARTICULARLY SOMETHING LIKE NAME OF THE WIND YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY READ THE LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA
I HAVE TO GO WITH FIRST LAW AS WELL

THE WITCHER SERIES IS GREAT SINCE NOONE HAS MENTIONED IT TRULY AN ALIVE UNIVERSE THAT IS HIGHLY REALISTIC IN IT'S FANTASY SETTING SHAME IT ISNT WELL KNOWN
THIS IS A BIT OLD SO IT DOESN'T GET AS MUCH PRESS BUT I REALLY LOVED LLOYD WESTMARK TRILOGY I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT CAN BE RIGHTLY CLASSIFIED AS FANTASY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE USUAL MAGIC TROPES BUT THE SETTING MATCHES THE QUALIFICATION AND THE SCOPE IS QUITE EPIC THOUGH PERHAPS MORE FRENCH REVOLUTION THAN GAME OF THRONES

THIS YEAR I TOOK ON THE QUEST OF READING THE WHEEL OF TIME IT IS FREAKING AWESOME JUST STARTED READING THE TENTH BOOK WHEN I'M DONE WITH THE SERIES I PLAN TO START ON EITHER MALAYAN BOOK OF THE FALLEN OR DISCWORLD CAN'T DECIDE THOUGH AS I HEAR ONLY POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT BOTH
I'VE REALLY ENJOYED THE FALLEN BLADE SERIES AND THE IMAGER PORTFOLIO SERIES NEITHER ARE VERY HIGH BROW OR DARK TO BE FAIR BUT I THINK THEY HAVE GOOD LORE AND WORLD-BUILDING WITH SOME FUN CHARACTERS
DAVID EDDINGS
THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING BY TENSE H WHITE I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH ADMITTEDLY IT IS MORE ON THE SIDE OF FANTASY LITE BUT DON'T LET THAT DETER YOU

IF YOU'RE AT ALL INTO THE TONE AND PACING OF THE HARRY POTTER SERIES I WOULD SAY THIS BOOK IS VERY COMPARABLE IT STARTS OFF CHILDISH AND LIGHT BUT AS ARTHUR GROWS SO DOES THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD UNTIL YOU'RE ENDING IN AN ALL OUT WAR FOR CAMELOT SO GOOD
DAGGER AND COIN IS PRETTY GOOD
THE GONE SERIES BY MICHAEL GRANT
SINCE SANDERSON HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED PLENTY OF TIMES I'LL ADD WAITERSHIP DOWN

THE DEED OF PAKSENARRION BY ELIZABETH MOON THE AUTHOR WAS A MARINE AND SHE'S REALLY INTO TRAINING AND LOGISTICS WHICH MAKES IT ODD FOR A FANTASY TRILOGY AND PUTS SOME PEOPLE OFFICIAL IT'S SET IN A KIND OF STANDARD TZOLKIN D D KIND OF FANTASY WORLD BUT ADDS SOME GRITTY REALISM
WALTER MOERS ZANONIA SERIES IS A CURRENT FAVORITE FOR SHEER ZANINESS AND QUIRK
MISBORN TRILOGY PRETTY MUCH KNOCKED OFF MY FEET WITH IT'S TWIST AND TURNS AND EVERYTHING THAT CULMINATED TO THAT ENDING

GOD THAT ENDING I DON'T THINK I'VE READ ANYTHING SO FAR THAT HAS BEATEN MISBORN WITH IT'S COMPLETION
THE VIDESSOS CYCLE OR REALLY ANYTHING SET IN VIDESSOS BY HARRY TURTLEDOVE
THE TEMERAIRE SERIES BY NAOMI NOVAK BEEN MY TOP SERIES FOR YEARS NOW

EDIT I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE I CAN COUNT THIS AS FANTASY REALLY IT'S HISTORICAL FICTION
I LOVED THE BELGARIAD SERIES AND THE DRAGON NIMBUS SERIES
FAVORITES WOULD CURRENTLY BE THE KING-KILLER CHRONICLES SURE THE CONCEPT IS NOT NEW AND EVEN THE MAGIC OR HOW IT WORKS HAS BEEN THERE BEFORE IN OTHER BOOKS BUT THE CHARACTERS AND THE WRITING STYLE CROSA ARE SOMETHING ELSE IT'S SIMPLY BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN AND NOW THAT I'VE FINISHED BOTH BOOKS I HOPE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THAT MUCH LONGER FOR THE FINAL BOOK

A COURT OF THORNS OF ROSES AND THRONE OF GLASS BY SARAH J MAAS
THE ARTEFACTS OF POWER SERIES BY MAGGIE FUREY

WHEEL OF TIME ANYTHING ROBIN COBB MISTS OF AVALON TZOLKIN WAS THE MANUAL I REMEMBER CRYING ON THE SCHOOL BUS WHILE READING ABOUT THORIN DYING I WAS SUCH A WEIRD KID

TERRY BROOKS IS ALSO WINNING ANYTHING ROBIN COBB DOES EVER THE HIGHLIGHT BEING LOVERSHIP TRADERS IAN IRVINE WRITES A GREAT SERIES COULD BE HERE ALL DAY
NIGHT ANGEL TRILOGY BY BRENT WEEKS
DELETED
I'M NOT A GUY SO I GUESS I'M NOT ALLOWED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION
WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE ESTATE NO NOT AT ALL SEE WHEEL OF TIME
WELL BASICALLY FAN FICTION BUT YOU CAN'T SELL IT
R WRITING COULD HAVE A BETTER IDEA MIGHT WANT TO ASK OVER THERE
NOT A FAUX PAS BUT CERTAINLY LOW BROW PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN CONTINUATIONS OF NERO WOLFE DUNE JAMES BOND TOM CLANCY WORKS ETC AND THEY'RE ALL ALWAYS INFERIOR
IF YOU WERE GIVEN PERMISSION BY THE ESTATE IT WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING WEIRD

HOWEVER I THINK YOU WOULD STILL NEED TO LIST IAIN BANKS AS AN AUTHOR WITH YOU LISTED AS A AND THE ESTATE WOULD ARGUABLY GET PROCEEDS FROM ANY SALES

YOU'D DEFINITELY NEED TO BE TACTFUL IN HOW YOU REFERENCED IAIN WITH ANY WRITING THINK U VEGANPUNCHER WITH IAIN BANKS OR BY U VEGANPUNCHER SET IN THE CULTURE UNIVERSE OF IAIN BANKS


IF YOU ARE SELLING IT IS PLAGIARISM AND WHOEVER OWNS THE RIGHTS CAN SUE IF YOU ARE NOT SELLING IT ITS JUST DOUCHE TO NOT AT LEAST ASK FOR PERMISSION FIRST
LISTS ARE THERE TO BE DISAGREED WITH SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S THE POINT OF THEM
THIS IS MY LIST OF BAFFLING OMISSIONS
TO THE BRIGHT EDGE OF THE WORLD EASILY ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS OF IF NOT MY FAVORITE REALLY BOOKS IN ONE ADVENTURE TALE THE STORY OF THE BIRTH OF AN ARTIST AND THE STORY OF A FRIENDSHIP WONDERFUL WELL-TOLD INTERWOVEN NARRATIVES

LMFAO AT SNUBBING THE GIRLS BY EMMA CLINES IT WAS SO THIS YEAR THAT THE SNUB IS SUCH A GOOD SLAP IN THE FACE
SPEAKING OF THE BOOKS THAT DID MAKE IT ON THE LIST I REALLY THOUGHT CHILDREN OF THE NEW WORLD WAS A PALE IMITATION OF BLACK MIRROR WITHOUT ANY OF THE LINGERING DEPTH
STILL KIND OF MIFFED ABOUT OYEYEMI NOT BEING ON THE NYU LIST DEFINITELY THE BEST BOOK OF SHORT FICTION I'VE READ RECENTLY

MY GUILTY PLEASURE BOOKS ARE THE TRUE BLOOD SERIES YOU CAN READ IN A DAY IF YOU'RE JUST LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE AND THEY SATISFY ALL MY JUNK NOVEL NEEDS FANTASY THAT'S MYSTERIOUS SEXY EMOTIONAL AND FUNNY WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR
I LIKE THE ROBERT LANGDON BOOKS BY DAN BROWN THEY AREN'T GREAT NOVELS OR ANYTHING BUT THEY ARE FUN TO READ WHILE YOU ARE ON VACATION SITTING BY THE OCEAN
WOULD THE DRESDEN FILES CLASSIFY

TO ME THEY ARE THE BOOK EQUIVALENT OF A SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE
ANYTHING BY SOPHIE KINSELLA HER BOOKS ARE SO CHEESY AND RIDICULOUS AND UNREALISTIC BUT ALSO SO SO EASY TO READ HELP TAKE MY MIND OFF THINGS AND LEAVE ME GRINNING AFTER THEY'RE OVER
FOR ME IS NOT EVEN A BOOK I LIKE READING CREEPY PASTAS AND STORIES IN R DOGSLEEP
THE ARE NOT GREAT WRITTEN NOR BAD PUT EACH STORY IS A DIFFERENT WORLD OF A KIND I WASTE TOO MUCH TIME READING THOSE
I DON'T DO GUILTY PLEASURES IF I LIKE SOMETHING I LIKE IT SHAMELESSLY AND OPENLY

THERE ARE PLENTY OF BOOKS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BUT THESE TWO I COULD READ AGAIN AND AGAIN

UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS BY PORTIA DE ROSSI IT'S A VERY GOOD BOOK THAT DETAILS HER STRUGGLES WITH HER WEIGHT WHILE TRYING BEING ON ALLY MCNEAL IT'S WRITTEN EXTREMELY WELL AND SHE IS VERY HONEST ABOUT HERSELF

THE GUNS OF AUGUST BY BARBARA TUCHMAN IT'S ABOUT WORLD WAR ONE WHAT LED TO IT AND HOW IT WAS FOUGHT IN THE EARLY MONTHS WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT THIS BOOK IS HER WRITING STYLE SHE HAS A TRUE TALENT FOR WRITING AND FOR TURNING HISTORY INTO A FASCINATING STORY
BOOKS BY EDWARD LEE RICHARD LAYMON BRYAN SMITH AND SOME OTHER AUTHORS LIKE THEM

THEY WRITE THESE INCREDIBLY HORRIFIC VIOLENT GORY BOOKS I'M NOT EXAGGERATING SOME OF THEM ARE SO DISGUSTING THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO GO ON BUT IT DOES HOLD A WEIRD FASCINATION FOR ME

WHEN I SAY THESE ARE MY GUILTY PLEASURE BOOKS I MEAN GUILTY AS IN IF ANYONE CLOSE TO ME FINDS OUT THAT I READ THESE BOOKS I'LL BE LOCKED UP IN A MENTAL HOSPITAL
I DON'T HAVE WHAT I CONSIDER GUILTY PLEASURES ANYMORE THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF A GUILTY PLEASURE IS I LIKE THIS BOOK BUT I FEEL EMBARRASSED BECAUSE OTHER READERS MIGHT LOOK DOWN ON IT AND THAT WOULD HURT MY CHANCES OF BEING SEEN AS SOMEONE WHO READS GOOD SMART LITERATURE SO I'LL HIDE BEHIND CALLING IT A GUILTY PLEASURE INSTEAD OF ADMITTING I GENUINELY ENJOY IT

I USED TO THINK THAT WAY AND IT TOOK A CONSCIOUS EFFORT AND THE PASSING OF YEARS TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE I JUST READ WHAT I ENJOY AND DON'T CARE IF IT'S A MAINSTREAM YA BEST SELLER OR OBSCURE CLASSIC
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE THE FIRST OF JANE THAT I READ AND STILL MY FAVOURITE

NATHAN MY YEAR OF FLOPS BOOK SOME OF THE BEST CRITICISM YOU'LL FIND ABOUT BAD AND FILMS ANYWHERE FROM AN AVCLUB REVIEWER NO LESS READING ABOUT HOW HE TORTURES HIMSELF BY REVIEWING THE FILMS IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THE BOOK ITSELF
DAVID DEBUT NOVEL FIRST BLOOD IS A VERY GOOD CHARACTER DRIVEN NOVEL THAT I'VE READ HALF A DOZEN TIMES THE BOOK GRABS YOU BY THE BALLS FROM THE FIRST PAGE AND IT IS VERY HARD TO PUT IT DOWN THE FIRST TIME I PICKED IT UP I READ IT FROM COVER TO COVER IN ONE GO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT

SARAH DENSEN OR NICHOLAS SPARKS EASY MINDLESS BOOKS
THE STEPHANIE PLUM SERIES BY JANET JOVANOVICH AND THE PRINCESS DIARIES SERIES I LISTEN TO THEM IN CAR WITH MY DAUGHTER WHO'S I ALSO SHAMELESSLY ENJOY FANATIC
I LOVE GRAPHIC NOVELS OR COMIC BOOKS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY DON'T HAVE LITERARY VALUE ALAN MOORE AND NEIL CAIMAN ARE TWO GREAT EXAMPLES AS FAR AS THAT'S CONCERNED

BUT I'VE ALSO GOT PUNISHER MAX VOLUME AND BULLETS QUEUED UP TOO HAHA I READ IN AN ORDER A COUPLE OF FICTION BOOKS THEN A GRAPHIC NOVEL OR TWO THEN I'LL READ SOME LIKE RICK LIBERTY TRILOGY

ALSO IF YOU LIKE GRAPHIC NOVELS AND HAVEN'T YET DONE SO CHECK OUT BLACK SCIENCE IT IS RIDICULOUSLY GOOD
READY PLAYER ONE I AGREE WITH LITERALLY EVERY CRITIQUE OF IT THAT I'VE READ BUT DAMN IT DID I LOVE READING THAT BOOK

ONE OF THE EVIL FOSTER PARENTS COUNT OLAF TRIES TO MARRY THE OLDEST ORPHAN SO HE COULD LEGALLY GET THE FORTUNE HE ALSO HANGED THE BABY ORPHAN IN A CAGE THROUGH A WINDOW OF THE TALLEST TOWER TO KILL IF HE DIDN'T MARRY ONE OF THE OTHER ORPHANS THE NARRATOR HIMSELF CONSTANTLY SAYS YOU SHOULD STOP READING THE BOOK OR DESTROY IT

SCHOLASTIC PUBLISHED THIS SERIES IT'S CLASSIFIED AS A CHILDREN'S BOOK

I LOVE THESE BOOKS FOR HOW GRIM AND SURPRISINGLY FUNNY THEY ARE WHICH IS WHY I'M GUILTY READING THEM YOU'VE PROBABLY WATCHED THE MOVIE AND IF SO THE BOOKS ARE BETTER I REALLY RECOMMEND IF YOU ENJOY DARK HUMOUR OR SATIRE NETFLIX IS MAKING A ADAPTATION OF THESE BOOKS IT'S COMING OUT JANUARY IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD IN MY OPINION SO I'D READ THE BOOKS BEFORE IT COMES OUT
I GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GUILTY PLEASURE FROM K DETECTIVE SERIES IT'S PULPY AND FUN AND I DON'T NORMALLY READ POTBOILERS
PRETTY MUCH ANY TERRY PRITCHETT BOOK

EASY TO READ HILARIOUSLY FUNNY WITH INTELLIGENT STORY LINES
COZY MYSTERIES OR HISTORICAL ROMANCES I GUESS
HONESTLY MY GUILTY PLEASURE BOOK IS PALO ALTO BY JAMES FRANCO IT'S POORLY WRITTEN BUT I THINK THAT JUST SUBMERGES ME MORE INTO THE MINDSET OF I'M READING A PASSAGE WRITTEN BY A TEENAGE
HEATHER GRAHAM ROMANCES OH GA

MENTAL HEALTH AUTOBIOGRAPHIES CRAZY IS SOMETIMES BRILLIANT ANYTHING ABOUT MY OWN DIAGNOSED MENTAL ILLNESS AS WELL I WANNA KNOW WHY I AM THE WAY I AM

I AM A BOT AND THIS ACTION WAS PERFORMED AUTOMATICALLY PLEASE CONTACT THE MODERATORS OF THIS SUBREDDIT MESSAGE COMPOSE TO R BOOKS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS
LITERALLY JUST STARTED IT HE'S ON THE LAUNCHPAD RIGHT NOW

GIVE ME A COUPLE DAYS
I ALSO JUST DOWNLOADED THE AUDIOBOOK THE OTHER DAY THOUGH I JUST STARTED A DIFFERENT BOOK BUT I'LL BAIL ON THAT ONE AND PUT THIS ONE ON INSTEAD
THE BEST SOLUTION I CAN THINK OF IS TO SEND THE GOOD SHIT TO ME
PAHAHAHA GET RID OF BOOKS I NEED ALL OF THEM EVEN THE ONES I'LL NEVER READ ESPECIALLY THE ONES IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE THAT I CAN'T READ

SERIOUSLY THOUGH I HAVE ACCRUED A THOUSANDISH BOOKS AND MOST OF THEM JUST SIT ON A BOOK SHELF OR IN BOXES I DO GET RID OF A FEW FROM TIME TO TIME MOSTLY BY GIVING THEM TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY BUT I LIKE MY COLLECTION
I COLLECT BOOKS LIKE A DROWNING PERSON COLLECTS AIR DESPERATELY AND COMPULSIVELY

THERE'S A LIMIT THOUGH AND MY HOUSE IS LIKE A REVOLVING DOOR OF BOOKS I GET HEAPS AND HEAPS OF BOOKS AS ARCS OR FROM SECONDHAND BOOKS STORES OR JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE I LIKE THE LOOK OF THEM

TYPICALLY WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET RID OF BOOKS I KEEP THE FOLLOWING THINGS IN MIND

DID I ENJOY THE BOOK IF I'D GIVE IT LESS THAN A STAR RATING THEN IT'S OUT EXCEPTION IF IT'S PART OF A SET

2 DO I HAVE A DOUBLE OF THIS BOOK IF YES THEN IT'S OUT EXCEPTION IF THE OTHER EDITION S IS SPECIAL OR PART OF A SET

AM I LIKELY TO READ THIS BOOK AGAIN IF NO THEN SET IT FREE SO SOMEONE ELSE CAN READ IT EXCEPTIONS IF IT WAS A GIFT SIGNED A SPECIAL EDITION OR PART OF A SET

AM I LIKELY TO EVER READ THIS BOOK AT ALL IF NO MAYBE ALSO GET RID OF IT IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT I'M A VERY OPTIMISTIC READER SO I RARELY IF EVER WILL GET RID OF A BOOK BECAUSE I HAVEN'T READ IT YET

I HAVE TO SAY I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER REGRETTED GETTING RID OF BOOKS UNLESS I LOST THEM AFTER LENDING THEM AND NEVER GOT THEM BACK BUT I HAVE DEFINITELY REGRETTED NOT BUYING BOOKS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
RARE DAY THAT I'LL BE IN THE MOOD TO DO THIS IF YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF BOOKS YOU CAN BE CHOOSIER I'LL GO INTO A ROOM AND SAY I NEED TO THROW OUT TEN BOOKS I'LL LOOK FOR SOMETHING WITH AN OBVIOUS FLAW OR A BOOK THAT IS FROM AN UNKNOWN AUTHOR THAT'S NOT A FIRST EDITION YES I HAVE WAY TOO MANY BOOKS
I STILL HAVE A LOT OF BOOKS BUT CULLED MY COLLECTION A GREAT DEAL WHEN I LAST MOVED MY PROCESS WAS UNCOMPLICATED I KEPT ONLY MY VERY FAVORITES AND THOSE I KNEW I'D BEEN DYING TO READ FOR YEARS IT WAS RELATIVELY SIMPLE I'VE HAD NO REGRET OVER IT
THERE IS A GREAT BOOK WHICH IS ENJOYABLE FOR MAKING TIDYING UP ALL SPIRITUAL CALLED THE LIFE CHANGING MAGIC OF TIDYING UP THERE ARE ACTUALLY SOME GREAT SNIPPETS IN THERE TO DO BOOKS YOU HAVE TO
A BE STRONG
B TAKE THEM ALL OUT AND PUT THEM ON THE FLOOR ALL OF THEM
C HOLD EACH ONE AND WORK OUT IF IT BRINGS YOU JOY THIS IS A PHRASE SHE KEEPS COMING BACK TO BUT IT IS TRUE SOME BOOKS YOU PICK UP AND THEY MAKE YOU HAPPY OR MAKE YOU SMILE OR MAKE YOU GO BACK IN TIME TO A PLACE ETC ETC IF THAT IS THE CASE KEEP IT IF NOT ITS OUT

I GIVE ALL MY BOOKS TO CHARITY SHOPS WHO PROBABLY PULP A LOT OF THEM TO BE HONEST
I HOPE TO ONE DAY TO BE EMOTIONALLY READY TO GET RID OF BOOKS I DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT DAY BEING ANYTIME SOON
BUT
I WOULD GO THROUGH THE ONES YOU'VE READ AND GET RID OF THE ONES YOU WON'T EVER REREAD THE REST I WOULD READ THE BACKS OF AND LOOK UP ON GOODREADS AND IF THEY DON'T SOUND INTERESTING OR GET REALLY BAD RATINGS STARS OR LESS TOSS THEM
YOU CAN DONATE THEM OR TAKE THEM TO USED BOOK STORES AND MAYBE GET A LITTLE BIT FOR THEM OR DO LIKE EMMA WATSON AND LEAVE THEM LYING AROUND ON A SUBWAY YOU COULD ALSO GIVE SOME TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT READ THEN YOU CAN ALSO BORROW THEM OR HAVE A GIANT BOOK YARDSALE THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
I SAVED

A ANY BOOKS THAT ARE SPECIAL EDITION PICTURE BOOKS SIGNED GIFTS

B ANYTHING THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE AS AN BOOK

C ANYTHING I ON A REGULAR BASIS

D ANYTHING I BOUGHT RECENTLY AND HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO YET OWNED FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WITHOUT BEING READ WAS OUT

EVERYTHING ELSE OUT

IT HELPED THAT I WAS MAKING A MAJOR MOVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THAT I HAD RECENTLY EMBRACED DIGITAL READING SOMETIMES I MISS MY FOUR BOOKSHELVES HIGH AND TRIPLE STACKED ON EVERY SHELF AND IF I EVER OWN A BIG HOUSE I WILL DEFINITELY HAVE A PHYSICAL COLLECTION AGAIN BUT REALLY I LOVE READING ON MY KINDLE AND I LOVE THE SPACE I CAN NOW FILL UP WITH OTHER PILES OF STUFF
LOVED THIS ONE THERE'S ALSO A MOVIE ADAPTATION THOUGH I ALWAYS FEEL THAT THE BOOK IS BEST I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANOTHER OF FREDRICK BOOK MY GRANDMOTHER ASKED ME TO TELL YOU SHE'S SORRY THE STORYLINES ARE VERY DIFFERENT BUT YOU'LL FIND THAT BACKMAN IS JUST AS FANTASTIC AT INTRODUCING ENDEARING CHARACTERS WHO MANAGE TO BRING YOU TO TEARS BOTH FROM LAUGHING OUT LOUD AND FROM HIGHLY EMOTIONAL SCENES
I READ THIS BOOK OVER THE SUMMER AND CAN TELL IT IS THE TYPE OF BOOK I WILL COUNTLESS TIMES IN MY LIFE PERFECT BLEND OF COMEDY AND MISERY THE PART WHERE HE SPOILERS S LOCKS A JOURNALIST IN HIS GARAGE AND IS TOO ANXIOUS TO FREE HER IS PRICELESS
I READ IT AND I REALLY LOVED IT I HAD TO READ HIS OTHER BOOKS WHICH WERE GOOD BUT I REALLY LOVED THIS ONE THE MOST IF YOU LIKE THIS ONE YOU MAY LIKE THE CURIOUS CHARMS OF ARTHUR PEPPER
EXCELLENT THANK YOU
I WONDER IF HEMINGWAY EVER WROTE ABOUT IT
I REMEMBER STUFF HIS PRO FOOTBALL THING WAS FUN
GOD A BIOGRAPHY BY JACK MILES IS A CLASSIC PULITZER WINNER THAT GOES THROUGH EACH BOOK OF THE BIBLE BREAKING IT DOWN AS LITERATURE WITH THE CHARACTER OF GOD ANALYSED AS THE PROTAGONIST IN MANY CASES

HOME BOOKS
CHECK OUT AN OLD BOOK CALLED HAMLET'S MILL
I HAD TO READ A FEW SECTIONS OF THE BIBLE FOR A SORT OF JOINT HISTORY LITERATURE CLASS IN COLLEGE THERE ARE SOME GREAT STORIES IN THERE SPECIFICALLY THE BOOK OF GENESIS EXODUS THAT DEFINITELY INFLUENCED LITERATURE FOR CENTURIES I FOUND IT INTERESTING TO COMPARE THOSE STORIES TO EARLIER WRITINGS LIKE THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH
DEFINITELY READ THROUGH THE WHOLE NEW TESTAMENT AND I'D RECOMMEND THE SONG OF SOLOMON IT'S A LOVE POEM THAT YOU DON'T REALLY HEAR REFERENCED TO MUCH BUT I FOUND IT ENJOYABLE NONE THE LESS
YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK THE BIBLE AS LITERATURE BY GABEL AND WHEELER
THIS DOESN'T FIT YOUR DESCRIPTION EXACTLY BUT WHEN I HAD THE SAME IDEA A FEW YEARS AGO I FOUND AN AUDIO COURSE CALLED THE BIBLE AS THE ROOT OF WESTERN LITERATURE STORIES POEMS AND PARABLES BY THE MODERN SCHOLAR IT WAS VERY HELPFUL YOU CAN PROBABLY STILL GET IT FROM THE LIBRARY

IN THE SAME VEIN ANOTHER PUBLISHER OF AUDIO COURSES THE GREAT COURSES BROUGHT OUT A NEW COURSE CALLED READING BIBLICAL LITERATURE GENESIS TO REVELATION A FEW MONTHS AGO I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT WHETHER TO GET IT


I THINK THE MOST SECTIONS WOULD BE GENESIS AND THE APOCALYPSE
THERE ARE LOTS OF BIBLE READING PLANS TO HELP READERS GO THROUGH PART OR ALL OF THE BIBLE I DID THE DAY OVERVIEW MENTIONED ON THAT PAGE I LINKED ABOVE THE PUBLISHER CALLED IT THE TOUR OF THE BIBLE PLAN IT'S READINGS OF ABOUT MINUTES EACH AND IT COVERS ABOUT ONE-QUARTER OF THE OVERALL MASS OF THE PROTESTANT BIBLE YOU CAN GO SHORTER OR LONGER DEPENDING ON HOW DEEP YOU WANT TO GO
I WOULD SAY TRY SOME OF THE RELIGIOUS BOOKS OF THE RELIGIONS THE COUPLE THAT I'VE READ I FOUND TO BE HIGHLY INTERESTING THOUGH I MUST SAY I HAVEN'T READ ANY OF THE TEXTS OF THE ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS SO CAN'T COMMENT ON THEM
HONESTLY IF YOU'RE ONLY READING FOR FUN JUST PICK A BOOK AND CURSORY READ A COUPLE OF REVIEWS BECAUSE FROM MY EXPERIENCE REVIEWS WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IF AN AUTHOR IS OBVIOUSLY BIASED SOMEONE ON AMAZON OR GOODREADS WILL HAVE PICKED UP ON IT JUST LOOK AT SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL REVIEWS

BUT IN GENERAL YOU'LL FIND IT PRETTY HARD TO AVOID BIAS AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF BIAS IS SUCH A BAD THING IN THAT REGARD THAT IS AS LONG AS YOU APPLY CRITICAL THINKING AND REALIZE THAT IT'S ONLY THE AUTHORS OPINION WHICH YOU'RE BOUND TO ENCOUNTER ANYWAY

WELL YOU CAN ALWAYS ASK FOR RECOMMENDATIONS IN R SUGGESTMEABOOK OR IN OUR WEEKLY RECOMMENDATION THREAD

PERSONALLY I LIKE TO CANCEL OUT ANY BIAS IN A BOOK BY READING A BOOK ABOUT THE SAME TOPIC BUT FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW AND BY A DIFFERENT AUTHOR

HOWEVER IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO OUT OF YOUR WAY MOST SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS HAVE A BOOK REVIEW SECTION FIND A SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL ABOUT THE TOPIC YOU WOULD LIKE TO READ ABOUT AND CHECK THEIR REVIEWS

PERSONALLY I ALSO LIKE TO CHECK BACK AT MY COLLEGE BOOKSTORES WEBSITE TO SEE WHAT SOME OF MY OLD PROFESSORS ARE ASSIGNING IN THEIR CLASSES THESE DAYS IN MY EXPERIENCE MOST COLLEGE BOOKSTORE WEBSITES ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS THE ASSIGNED READING LIST FOR MOST CLASSES
OFTEN IT'S SIMPLY A CASE OF HAVING TO READ MORE THAN ONE BOOK ABOUT ANY GIVEN SUBJECT HIE WE OFTEN LIKE TO BELIEVE THERE IS AN OBJECTIVE TRUTH IN THE REALITY IN A LARGE NUMBER OF FIELDS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DEAL WITH PEOPLE IS THAT TRUTH IS A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE MOST MASTER'S DEGREES INVOLVE A FAIR BIT OF READING OTHERS WORK AND I'M SURE IN THAT CONTEXT YOU DIDN'T JUST READ ONE BOOK AND BELIEVE EVERYTHING WRITTEN INSIDE IT YOU THOUGHT CRITICALLY ABOUT THE SOURCE AND COMPARED IT TO OTHERS ON THE SAME SUBJECT

WHILE YOU MAY NOT FIND THE PERFECT SOURCE OF RECOMMENDATIONS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS WITHIN REDDIN FOR EXAMPLE R ASKHISTORIANS IS LIKELY TO BE A BETTER SOURCE FOR BOOKS ON HISTORY THAN R SUGGESTMEABOOK BECAUSE AS USEFUL AS THE LATTER IS THE FORMER SIMPLY HAS A GREATER KNOWLEDGE OF THAT SUBJECT SIMILARLY LOOKING AT THE OVERALL RATING FOR A BOOK ON GOODREADS MAY NOT BE VERY HELPFUL BUT FOLLOWING A REVIEWER WHO'S READ A LARGE NUMBER OF BOOKS ON THE SAME SUBJECT AND HAS MAYBE EVEN FORMALLY STUDIED THAT FIELD MIGHT BE MAKE THE BEST OF THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOU

TO PIGGYBACK ON U SUGGESTION CHECK OUT WHAT JOURNALS AND MAGAZINES YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY OR UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IF YOU STILL HAVE ACCESS SUBSCRIBES TO AND MAYBE EVEN ASK A LIBRARIAN IF THEY HAVE ANY FURTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR SOURCES OF RECOMMENDATIONS OR ACCURACY CHECKERS
THERE ARE BOUND TO NONFICTION BOOKS THAT ARE BIASED THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH THEM IS WITH AN OPEN MIND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO READ ABOUT TOPICS FROM DIFFERENT AUTHORS POINTS OF VIEW TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE AUTHOR MAY WRITE ABOUT THAT TOPIC AND WHY THEY MAY HAVE FORMED THEIR OPINION OR BIAS BIAS SHOULD NOT BE A BAD THING IT CAN HELP GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON HISTORY
I ABUSE THE HELL OUT OF THE LIBRARY WHEN I FIND A BOOK THAT I ENJOY OR THAT I WANT TO LEARN MORE FROM I'LL READ SOMETHING USED AS A PRIMARY SOURCE USING INTERLIBRARY LOANS THAT RABBIT HOLE CAN KEEP YOU BUSY FOREVER I JUST PICKED UP A BOOK ABOUT HOW PAKISTAN ACQUIRED THE NUCLEAR BOMB I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT TO THAT BOOK BUT HEY IT'S FASCINATING STUFF

ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE AN AMAZON OR GOODREADS REVIEW CAN COME IN HANDY THOUGH THERE ARE OBVIOUS DANGERS TO THAT I'LL READ THROUGH THE REVIEWS AFTER READING A BOOK AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL LIST AN ALTERNATE RECOMMENDATION TO A TITLE OR AN ADDENDUM TO IT

AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED A LOT OF SUBREDDITS HAVE A RECOMMENDED READING LIST AND I'VE USUALLY BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE LIST QUALITY DIFFERENT SUBS HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS THOUGH

YOU'RE OVERTHINKING THIS THOUGH MAKE A DECISION AND ROLL WITH IT
ASK YOURSELF FIRST WHAT GENRE OF NONFICTION DO I WANT TO READ IT'S A PRETTY BROAD SUBJECT SCIENCE HISTORY BIO CULTURAL STUDIES TRUE CRIME THERE ARE OUTSTANDING AUTHORS IN EACH CATEGORY NARROW YOUR SEARCH AND START THERE
GO TO THE COLLEGE LIBRARY AND SPEAK TO THE SUBJECT MATTER LIBRARIANS IT'S THEIR JOB TO KEEP UP ON THE LATEST AND BEST BOOKS ON THEIR TOPIC THEY CAN GIVE YOU A PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF WHICH NONFICTION WORKS ARE CLASSICS IN ANY PARTICULAR FIELD AND WHICH ONES ARE EMERGING NOT TO MENTION WHICH ONES ARE APPROACHABLE FOR A LAY AUDIENCE PERSONALLY I DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT READING BOOKS THAT AREN'T RESPECTED IN THE FIELD BECAUSE I USUALLY READ ON THE SAME TOPIC SO I CAN GET A GOOD SENSE OF HOW THEIR ARGUMENTS OVERLAP CONTRADICT EACH OTHER

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME RANDOM PLACES TO START HERE ARE A FEW I'VE READ LATELY I'VE BEEN ON A HISTORY BENT LATELY
THE IDEA FACTORY BELL LABS AND THE GREAT AGE OF AMERICAN INNOVATION BY JON GERTNER
OWNING THE EARTH THE TRANSFORMING HISTORY OF LAND OWNERSHIP BY ANDO LINKLATER
EMPIRE OF THE SUMMER MOON QANAT PARKER AND THE RISE AND FALL OF THE COMANCHES BY SOUTH C GWYNNE
THE BIG BURN TEDDY ROOSEVELT AND THE FIRE THAT SAVED AMERICA BY TIMOTHY EGAN
THE BIG SORT WHY THE CLUSTERING OF LIKE-MINDED AMERICANS IS TEARING US APART BY BILL BISHOP
TALIBAN BY AHMED RASHID
FEARFUL SYMMETRY THE SEARCH FOR BEAUTY IN MODERN PHYSICS BY A ZEE
THE MASSACRE AT EL MOGOTE BY MARK DANNER


INFINITE JEST BURNED ME OUT ON TENNIS BOOKS
I'D CALL IT A BLOODY GOOD BOOK AND LEAVE IT THERE
THE WORD NOVELLA SIMPLY MEANS SHORT NOVEL OR LONG SHORT STORY THE ONLY CRITERIA IS LENGTH
I KNOW CYRIL IT'S AN ALLEGORICAL NOVELLA ABOUT STALINISM

ARCHER TAUGHT ME THIS
ISN'T IT A NOVELLA JUST IN TERMS OF LENGTH I ALWAYS THINK OF BOOKS ABOUT THAT LENGTH AS NOVELLAS
NOVELLA
YOU'LL OFTEN SEE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NOVEL AND NOVELLA SOMETIMES DEPENDS ON THE NOTORIETY

A BOOK LIKE ANIMAL FARM TECHNICALLY IS A NOVELLA BUT FEW CALL IT THAT BY TECHNICAL STANDARDS CLOCKWORK ORANGE OLD MAN AND THE SEA GREAT GATSBY ETC ARE ALL NOVELLAS BUT AGAIN THEY'RE RARELY REFERRED TO AS SUCH
ITS A NOVELLA
ANIMAL FARM IS ROUTINELY GIVEN AS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A NOVELLA ALMOST ANY BEST NOVELLA LIST WILL CONTAIN ANIMAL FARM AND ALMOST ANY DESCRIPTION OF ANIMAL FARM WILL CALL IT A NOVELLA LONGER THAN A SHORT STORY SHORTER THAN A NOVEL EXCELLENT SATIRE WITHOUT BEING OVERLY WORDY ETC NOVELLAS MAY USUALLY NOT HAVE CHAPTERS AS THE ARTICLE THAN YOU LINKED STATES BUT THEY CERTAINLY CAN

I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHY IT REALLY MATTERS THOUGH UNLESS YOU FEEL THAT NOVELLAS ARE SOMEHOW LESS VALUABLE THAN NOVELS YOU CAN CALL IT A SHORT NOVEL IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPIER
I RECKON ITS A NOVELLA
NOVELLA
WORDS SHORT STORY

NOVELETTE

NOVELLA

NOVEL

OF COURSE THERE IS ALWAYS SPECULATION BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE WORD COUNT IS WHAT DETERMINES THE TECHNICAL PLACEMENT OF A PIECE OF WORK
THERE IS NO STRICT DEFINITION OF WHEN A NOVELLA BECOMES LONG ENOUGH TO JOIN THE NOVEL CLUB ANIMAL FARM IS A SHORT NOVEL THE CHARACTERISATION COMPLEX STORY ARC AND UNDENIABLE SENSE BOTH OF RIGOUR AND COMPLETENESS HAVE ALL THE HALLMARKS OF A NOVEL
HOW MANY PAGES IS IT
IS PLUTO A PLANET OR A DWARF PLANET

ALSO DOES IT REALLY MATTER I KNOW MY LIFE ISN'T IMPACTED BY IT BEING A NOVEL OR A NOVELLA AS IT ARGUABLY FITS BOTH DEFINITIONS JUST FINE HOPEFULLY YOUR LIFE ISN'T IMPACTED BY IT EITHER
IT'S A FAIRY STORY
AS FAR AS I CARE

DOES THE WORK HAVE CLEARLY MARKED INTERNAL DIVISIONS CHAPTERS EPISODES BOOKS HOWEVER ELSE THEY'RE CALLED Y N

IF YES IT'S A NOVEL

IF NOT IT'S A SHORT STORY

THEN WHAT IS A NOVELLA

A MARKETING TERM WITHOUT RELEVANCE

DO NOTE I'M TALKING ABOUT PROSE NOT ABOUT POETRY OR DRAMA
I WAS TOLD IN MY SWEDISH CLASS I'M SWEDISH THAT A NOVELLA CAN'T DEPICT A STORY OCCURRING FOR A LONGER PERIOD THAN HOURS ALTHOUGH IT CAN JUMP AROUND AND ACTUALLY BE LONGER THAN OTHER BOOKS THE MAIN STORY CAN ONLY OCCUR WITHIN THE HOUR TIME SPANISH

I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF I AGREE WITH THAT SINCE I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE SOME OF THE DAN BROWN BOOKS NOVELLAS BUT I DON'T KNOW
SO BY THAT DEFINITION THE ANIMAL FARM WOULD NOT BE A NOVELLA EVEN THOUGH IT'S RATHER SHORT
I USUALLY USE PAPER IT'S SIMPLE TO USE I CAN BRING IT ANYWHERE KEEP UNLIMITED BOOKMARKS AND NOTES OF VARIOUS STYLES AND BEST OF ALL IT DOESN'T UPLOAD MY READING HABITS TO SERVERS OR ANYTHING I LOVE THE TACTILE FEEDBACK FEATURES AND NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RECHARGING IT'S PRETTY GREAT OVERALL
THE BOOK IS MANY THINGS INCLUDING VERY GOOD BUT AN ACID TRIP IT IS NOT
IT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITES I READ THIS YEAR I CAN'T RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH BUT I ALSO CAN'T REALLY DESCRIBE WHY IT'S SO GREAT IN A FEW SENTENCES IT'S JUST A PORTRAIT OF AN ORDINARY LIFE IN THE EARLY CENTURY SET AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF TWO WARS AND THE DEPRESSION THE WRITING WAS AMAZING I ALSO READ HIS WESTERN TYPE BOOK BUTCHER'S CROSSING WHICH I WAS SURPRISED I DID NOT LIKE ALL THAT MUCH
I ALSO LIKE MARIJUANA BUT EVERYONE I ASK SAYS THIS BOOK ISN'T ACTUALLY FOR STONERS AND THAT STONER WAS JUST THE GUYS NAME WAS I GIVEN FAULTY INFO A BOOK DOESN'T NEED TO SHOW DRUG USE TO BE A GOOD STONED READING EXPERIENCE
IT'S ONE OF THOSE BRILLIANTLY UNDERRATED BOOKS THAT I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING RECOMMENDED RECENTLY AND READING IT WAS ALMOST A DIVINE EXPERIENCE FOR ME CAN'T STOP RECOMMENDING IT TO EVERYONE
OTHER CHARITY SHOPS

LIBRARIES

SCHOOLS COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES

COFFEE SHOPS OR PUBS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOUR ARE SOME PLACES WILL JUST TAKE THEM AND STUCK THEM ON A SHELF FOR PATRONS

LOCAL COMMUNITY PROGRAMMES ASK YOUR COUNCIL OR COMMUNITY VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS
OFTEN SHELTERS LIKE THE WOMEN'S COMMUNITY SEEK BOOK DONATIONS

CHECK THE UNITED WAY IN YOUR AREA I THINK THEY LIST LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS SEEKING DONATIONS AND WHAT TYPES OF DONATIONS THEY NEED
VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA WILL PICK THEM UP FROM YOUR HOUSE CIRC


I LIKE THE IDEA OF LEAVING THEM IN PUBLIC PLACES IF YOU PUT ALL OF THEM IN A PARK THEN IT'S POSSIBLE SOMEONE WOULD GET PISSED OFF OR THEY'D GET CHUCKED AWAY BUT LEAVING A COUPLE HERE AND THERE SOUNDS OKAY TO ME I LIVE IN A BIG CITY AND WENT THROUGH A PHASE OF LEAVING BOOKS IN PHONE BOXES I LOVE A PHONE BOX
DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THESE IN YOUR AREA BUT LITTLE FREE LIBRARIES ARE GREAT FOR THIS SORT OF THING YOU WON'T GET RID OF THEM ALL IN ONE FEEL SWOOP BUT IT'S GOOD FOR GETTING A FEW OFF YOUR HANDS
DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PICTURES OF ROMEO BECKHAM ARE INCLUDED WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT I PURCHASE THIS
WHY DO YOU EVEN KNOW HIS NAME
IT'S DEFINITELY HELPED ME AVOID DRAMA IN MY PERSONAL LIFE AND WORKPLACE LIFE I PRACTICE THESE RULES QUITE WELL IN PERSON HOWEVER THEY OFTEN GO OUT THE WINDOW FOR ME IN COMMENT THREADS LOL WHICH I USUALLY REGRET
THE THIRD ONE DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS IS SO DIFFICULT TO APPLY IN PRACTICE WE ARE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ALL THE TIME AND WE DON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
THIS BOOK HELPED ME TO CHANGE MY LIFE THROUGH A VERY ROUGH TIME I WAS BATTLING A TERRIBLE HEROIN AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION AND HAD LOST MY WILL TO LIVE I WAS IN REHAB AND MY SISTER SENT ME THIS BOOK AND IT GAVE ME SO MUCH HELP AT HOW TO LIVE AND LOOK AT THE WORLD

I'VE READ IT ABOUT TIMES SINCE THEN AND I HAVE REMINDERS I TRY TO READ EVERYDAY TO USE THESE AGREEMENTS IN MY DAY-TO-DAY LIFE
I HAVE A CONFLICTED OPINION OF THIS BOOK I HEAR PRAISE FOR IT ALL THE TIME AND I THINK IT LIKELY HAS VALUE WHICH IS WHY I HAVEN'T THROWN IT IN THE TRASH BUT IT'S ON MY BOOKSHELF WITH THE BOOKMARK STILL ON PAGE WHERE I ABANDONED IT AFTER READING

WE CAST SPELLS ALL THE TIME WITH OUR OPINIONS AN EXAMPLE I SEE A FRIEND AND GIVE HIM AN OPINION THAT JUST POPPED INTO MY MIND I SAY HAMM I SEE THAT KIND OF COLOR IN YOUR FACE IN PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO GET CANCER IF HE LISTENS TO THE WORD AND IF HE AGREES HE WILL HAVE CANCER IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR THAT IS THE POWER OF THE WORD

THAT WAS THE MOMENT OF IRREDEEMABLE IDIOCY FOR ME
THIS BOOK WAS THE FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR MY DEPRESSION IT TOOK A LOT OF BOOKS SPIRITUAL THERAPY THERAPY MEDITATION AND TIME BUT THIS BOOK WAS THE KEY
THIS IS AN ALL TIME FAVORITE OF MINE I HAPPENED UPON IT AT MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE WHEN I WAS ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE AND READ IT AND HAVE COME BACK TO ITS TEACHINGS IN MY ADULT LIFE MORE TIMES THAN I COULD COUNT IT IS AN EXTREMELY USEFUL SET OF GUIDELINES IN LIVING A COMPASSIONATE AND FULFILLING WAY FOR SELF AND OTHERS AND VERY SHORT
GOT IT I'LL BE IMPACK I'LL BE IMPICC I'LL DO GOOD
THE CONVERSATION IN QUESTION STARTED HERE

A LITTLE MORE ABOUT IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE
I THOUGHT THE FIRST AGREEMENT WAS THAT WE ARE ALL MADE OF LIGHT
I FEEL BAD FOR THIS I'M NOT AN AVID READER HELL I DON'T READ WHO AM I KIDDING A BOSS FROM ANOTHER JOB GAVE ME THIS BOOK WHEN HE WAS ON HIS WAY OUT I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW GUESS I HAVE TO TAKE THIS AS A SIGN AND READ IT
STORYTIME SIGH I NEVER FINISHED THIS BOOK HERE'S WHY


AFTER HEARING POSITIVE REVIEWS I PURCHASED THE BOOK AROUND THE TIME I STARTED GOING TO THIS NEW CHURCH I BROUGHT THE BOOK WITH ME TO SERVICE ONE DAY TO READ AFTERWARDS AT THE END OF SERVICE I PULLED IT OUT AND WAS TALKING TO SOME OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT IT ONE OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH A GUY MY AGE STARTED GOING ON AND ON ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE THE BOOK IT WAS ACCORDING TO HIM THE BOOK WAS NOTHING SPECIAL AND THE AUTHOR WAS JUST RIPPING OFF IDEAS FROM THE BIBLE AND RESTATING THEM IN NEW ABEY WAYS HE WENT ON FOR ABOUT MINUTES AND SINCE I HADN'T FINISHED THE BOOK I COULDN'T DEFEND IT


AFTER THAT I DID NOT FINISH READING IT BUT SINCE THEN I HAVE LEFT THAT PARTICULAR CHURCH NO SURPRISE NOW THIS THREAD HAS ENCOURAGED ME TO FINISH IT
AND IF YOU DO NONE OF THESE THINGS AND SPEND YOUR LIFE DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE MAYBE YOU TOO CAN BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
WHAT'S UP WITH THE QUESTION ON GOODREADS REGARDING THE AUTHOR
WHO HERE KNOWS THE BACKGROUND OF THIS BOOK HOW MIGUEL CONNED ALL THOSE GIRLS INTO EDITING PUBLISHING PUBLICIZING THIS BOOK FOR NOTHING HOW HE SLEPT WITH ALL OF THEM HERE IN SAN DIEGO DO NOT SUPPORT THIS MANUAL THE GOOD IDEAS IN THIS BOOK ARE ALL FOUND IN OLDER MORE CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHIES THIS MAN JUST RAN A CULT NOTHING MORE
THIS JUST ARRIVED IN THE MAIL TODAY WHAT A PERFECT START
I'VE JUST BORROWED THIS BOOK FROM MY BOYFRIEND YOU ALL HAVE GIVEN ME THE MOTIVATION TO ACTUALLY START IT I'M EXCITED THANKS GUYS
THIS BOOK WAS VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING ME GET THROUGH A VERY HARD TIME IN MY LIFE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU ARE GOING THROUGH A BIG TRANSITION FEELING LOST ABOUT YOUR DIRECTION OR IF YOU HAVE ANY SELF DOUBT
I TRULY ENJOYED THIS BOOK I'M NOT GOING TO SAY I'VE IMPLEMENTED THE RULES BUT IT MADE ME THINK AND CONTINUES TO DO SO IT'S IN THE VERY SMALL PILE OF BOOKS I'VE KEPT TO REREAD AS NEEDED
MORE POWER TO ANYONE THAT GETS ANYTHING POSITIVE FROM THIS OR ANY OTHER SELF HELP BOOK BUT

THIS IS BOOK UTTER AND COMPLETE GARBAGE

I HAD THE PLEASURE TO WORK ON THE INFOMERCIAL FOR THIS STEAMING PILE FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON THEY WANTED VISUAL EFFECTS FOR IT I HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO DRAW THE SHORT STRAW TO WORK ON IT

NO JOKE THEY WANTED ANIMATED BLACK TENDRILS OF SMOKE FLOWING FROM THE MOUTH OF ONE ACTRESS INTO THE EARS OF ANOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS BEING MEAN TO HER OR SOMETHING LOADS OF INSANELY STUPID THINGS LIKE THAT

IF YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING CAPABLE OF FOLLOWING THE GOLDEN RULE AND HAVE AN OUNCE OF COMMON SENSE YOU CAN FIGURE THIS ALL OUT ON YOUR OWN

THIS CRAP IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS IS A NEW AGE WRAPPER SLAPPED ONTO SIMPLE CONCEPTS THAT ARE FROM MUCH OLDER SOURCES THE AUTHOR DUMBED THINGS DOWN INTO PUZZLINGLY WORDED SENTENCES TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE COMMANDMENTS


BUT SERIOUSLY IF YOU GET SOMETHING GOOD OUT OF THIS MORE POWER TO YOU I UH DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND I ALWAYS DO MY BEST EVEN WHEN RANTING ON THE INTERNET

AND REALLY I'M NOT TRYING TO INSULT ANYONE HERE MAYBE THE AUTHOR SO APOLOGIES IF YOU DO ACTUALLY LIKE THIS SORT OF THING AND SERIOUSLY I WISH EVERYONE WELL IN THEIR VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY WE CALL LIFE
SIMPLISTIC MODELED BEHAVIORS NEVER ACCOUNT FOR THE REAL WORLD TAKE THE WORK PLACE AS AN EXAMPLE

IF I SPEAK THE TRUTH ALL THE TIME AT WORK I MAY DIVULGE TOO MUCH INFORMATION OR NOT ENOUGH SOMETIMES I NEED TO LIE OR MISLEAD ESPECIALLY FOR LITIGIOUS REASONS WHEN BILLY ASKS IF HES GETTING FIRED I CAN'T JUST REMAIN SILENT OR REFUSE TO ANSWER WITHOUT SIGNALLING TO HIM THE TRUTH

PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF YOU DO MATTER IN MANY CASES COWORKERS WILL WORK TO SABOTAGE ME AT EVERY TURN JIM GOES AROUND TELLING PEOPLE I'M LAZY AND I SHOULDN'T CARE OPINIONS ABOUT ME AFFECT MY SALES PITCHES MY PRODUCT REVIEWS AND MY OVERALL AUTHORITY

THERE'S A TIME AND PLACE FOR ASSUMPTION IT'S THE BASIS FOR A LOT OF WORLD DISCOVERIES NOT MAKING ASSUMPTIONS WOULD ELIMINATE ALL RISK AND STYMIE DISCOVERY WAS A GREAT YEAR FOR ASSUMPTION

WHEN PEOPLE ASKED TO DO MY BEST IT'S LIKE GOOD LUCK IT'S WELL WISHING EVERYONE ALWAYS DOES THEIR BEST IN THEIR SUBSCRIBED REALITY THIS IS JUST NONSENSE

ON THAT NOTE THE BOOK IS BASICALLY SUGGESTING THE READER TEND TO THEIR REALITY WITHOUT REGARDING THAT OF OTHERS SOMETIMES HUMANS CAN DO THAT MANY TIMES THEY SHOULD NOT

ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR A LOT OF UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR IS OKAY I'M GOING TO LEGALLY DUMP MY COMPANIES CHEMICALS IN THE DESERT NO ONE WILL DISCOVER OR CARE ABOUT THIS UNTIL I'M LONG DEAD DOES THIS MEAN I SHOULD WRECK THE PLANET BECAUSE I ONLY CARE ABOUT MY REALITY
TOM FAVORITE BOOK
OVER THE SUMMER I TOOK A ROAD TRIP FROM EASY TO WEST COAST BUT THE CAR THREW A ROD ON THE UTAH NEVADA BORDER IN A GREYHOUND BUS STATION MY FRIEND AND I HAD A TWO HOUR CONVERSATION ABOUT LIFE WITH A TOTAL STRANGER A MAN IN HIS MID SIXTIES AT ONE POINT HE PULLED THIS BOOK OUT OF HIS BAG AND GAVE IT TO ME HE SAID HE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT LIFE AND HIMSELF BECAUSE OF THAT BOOK IT'S A GREAT FUCKING BOOK AND I'M GLAD I STUMBLED UPON IT IN SUCH A WAY
MPH AT FIRST I WAS REALLY INTO THIS BOOK THEN LIKE A LOT OF SELF HELP STUFF I REALISED IT TAKES AWAY A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT MAKES YOU HUMAN
BUT THAT BOOK IS CLICHED DOGMATIC TRASH
I JUST READ IT I AM CONSTANTLY REMINDING MYSELF ABOUT ASSUMPTIONS
EVEN AFTER A 3RD OR 4TH READ THIS SHIT STILL HOLDS UP
DON MIGUEL RPG MAKER DON MIGUEL
THIS BOOK IS A TREASURE FOUR SIMPLE RULES AND YET THEY CAN CHANGE LIFE FOR THE BETTER
BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER
DON'T TAKE REDDIN SERIOUSLY IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF WEIRDOS IDIOTS AND KIDS PRETENDING TO BE ADULTS FUCK REDDIN HAVE FUN
DID YOU WIN THE ARGUMENT THOUGH THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS
THAT MARKETING
AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER I'VE ALWAYS STRUGGLED WITH DO YOUR BEST WHEN THE JOB AS NO CLEARLY DEFINED END GOAL AND A LESSON PLAN COULD ALWAYS BE IMPROVED MANY TEACHERS BURN THEMSELVES OUT TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST SO WHAT DO WE DO AMAZING CLASSROOM AND BURNT OUT TEACHER OR PRETTY GOOD CLASSROOM AND HAPPY CONTENT TEACHER
ITT PEOPLE WHO HAVE READ THE BOOK SAYING IT CONTAINED VALUABLE INFORMATION AND LESSONS IN IMPROVING THEIR PERSONAL LIFE AND PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T READ IT OFFERING THEIR PEDANTIC OPINIONS ON A POINT SUMMARY
I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK
I LITERALLY JUST LEFT AND ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AND MY COUNSELOR RECOMMENDED IT I'M ON PAGE AND IT'S AMAZING
WHY DO I NEED A WHOLE BOOK ABOUT THIS
HARMONTOWN ANYONE
I HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK AND MAYBE IT'S GOOD BUT I'VE SEEN THIS LIST BEFORE AND FIND IT UNDERWHELMING

IS A COMMON CULTURAL NORM AND OCCASIONALLY ONE MUST BREAK ONE'S WORD

2 SEEMS PSYCHOLOGICALLY HIGHLY UNREALISTIC AND POSSIBLY NOT EVEN DESIRABLE

SHOULD BE APPLIED ASSUMPTIONS ARE NECESSARY HEURISTICS

IS BOTH ANOTHER COMMON NORM AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY UNREALISTIC UNLESS YOU WATER DOWN YOUR BEST TO MEAN YOUR BEST GIVEN HOW YOU'RE FEELING RIGHT NOW WHICH MAKES IT JUST ABOUT WORTHLESS


PRETTY BASIC SELF-HELP STUFF

DATED A GIRL WHO WAS ALL INTO THIS BOOK SHE MADE ME READ IT

TERRIBLE AT KEEPING HER WORD AVOIDED TAKING THINGS PERSONALLY TO THE POINT OF CAVALIER ATTITUDE TO RESPONSIBILITY ASSUMED SHE UNDERSTOOD A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE BECAUSE SHE READ IT IN A BOOK AND GENERALLY BACKED OUT OF DOING ANYTHING DIFFICULT

SHE SEEMED TO THINK THE BOOK MADE HER A BETTER PERSON

I'VE LEANED TO AVOID PEOPLE WHO THINK A BOOK CAN MAKE THEM BETTER THEY ARE USUALLY WRONG
DON MIGUEL RUIZ IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE AUTHOR THIS BOOK IS VERY GOOD BUT MASTERY OF LOVE IS MY FAVORITE FROM HIM I WOULD ALSO CHECK OUT BEYOND FEAR IF YOUR LIKE HIM
I HAVE THIS BOOK BUT ITS TINY IS THERE A FULL SIZE VERSION
THIS BOOK HAS HELPED ME IMPROVE MY LIFE DRAMATICALLY EACH AGREEMENT COMES WITH GREAT EXPLANATION FOR HOW TO APPLY THEM AND WHAT THE LIMITS ARE FOR EACH ONE I RECOMMEND EVERYONE READ THIS BOOK AND FOLLOW THE AGREEMENTS
SOUNDS A LOT LIKE JACOB THE BAKER
MY PARENTS RECOMMENDED THAT I READ THIS BOOK WHEN I HAD JUST FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL IT'S STAYED WITH ME EVER SINCE IT'S SO SIMPLE BUT SO POWERFUL IT'S DEFINITELY HELPED TO LESSEN ANY DRAMA AND TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE DO SAY WHAT THEY DO IT'S ONE OF THE FEW BOOKS I'LL NEVER GET RID OF
I LIKE APPLYING LAW TO EVERYDAY LIFE THAT IS

BE CONSERVATIVE IN WHAT YOU DO BE LIBERAL IN WHAT YOU ACCEPT FROM OTHERS

SO FOR MOST DECLARATIONS DON'T TAKE OFFENSE DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY KEEP IN MIND THEY MIGHT BE WRONG OR YOU'RE MISUNDERSTANDING IT AT THE SAME TIME BE VERY CAREFUL WITH WHAT YOU DECLARE NOT TO CAUSE ANY ANIMOSITY OR MISUNDERSTANDING YOURSELF WHICH IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION YOU'D EXPECT IF EVERYONE IS TOLERANT AND LIBERAL IN ACCEPTING OPINIONS

IF YOU AND OTHERS ACT THIS WAY I FIND YOUR INTERACTIONS GET VERY ROBUST AGAINST CONFLICTS JUST LIKE COMPUTER PROTOCOLS DO
HEY I KNOW YOU LOL
I JUST UNPACKED MY APARTMENT AND FOUND THIS BOOK I GOT IT AS A GIFT BUT HAVEN'T READ IT I'LL MAKE IT A POINT TO
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF A JUMP HERE BUT ECKERT A NEW EARTH IS QUITE SIMILAR I LOVED THE FOUR AGREEMENTS FANTASTIC FOR THOSE OF US SEARCHING FOR MORE IN WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE
I LOVE THIS BOOK READ IT FOR MY YOGA TEACHER TRAINING
THIS BOOK TRULY CHANGED THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO HAS NOT READ IT
THAT TITLE R SAVEDYOUACLICK
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ASSUMPTION AND A HYPOTHESIS
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS IS NEEDED MORE THAN ANYTIME BEFORE THE INTERNET HAS GIVEN SO MANY PEOPLE A HUGE PLATFORM TO SPREAD THEIR WORDS AND THERE ARE TOO MANY NEW FRACTIONS APPEARING WE NEED MORE GOOD THAT UNITES THAN SEPARATES US LET'S CREATE AN INTERNET CULTURE THAT IS UNITING
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS
ARE THESE THE FOUR THINGS TO DO IF YOU NEVER EVER WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
I RECENTLY RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO A FRIEND WHO ASKED IF I KNEW OF ANY GOOD BOOKS ON EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE I DO BELIEVE THAT IF SOMEONE FOLLOWED THESE RULES TO THE LETTER THAT THEIR LIFE WOULD BE A KIND OF HEAVEN I ALSO LOVE THE SIMPLICITY OF THE LANGUAGE USED THERE'S IMMENSE POWER AND PERSUASION IN SOMETHING SO DIRECT AND UNAMBIGUOUS
A MUST READ THOUGH I PERSONALLY SKIP THE FIRST CHAPTER
BEEN DOING MY BEST TO FOLLOW THESE EVERY DAY SINCE EARLY JULY GLAD TO SEE THIS HERE
SUCH A RAD BOOK
WORDS TO LIVE BY
HEY OP CHECK OUT THE MASTERY OF SELF WRITTEN BY DON MIGUEL RUIZ JR

IT'S A MODERNIZED VERSION OF ALL OF HIS FATHER'S TEACHINGS
BOOK SHOW
I REMEMBER READING THIS A LONG TIME AGO AND THOSE AGREEMENTS HAVE ALWAYS STAYED WITH ME
WHEN I STARTED MY JOB BACK IN FEBRUARY I WAS REQUIRED TO READ THIS AND ANOTHER BOOK AS WELL IT WAS DEFINITELY A BOOK THAT OPENED MY EYES
CAN ANYONE LEND SOME ADVICE TO HELP WITH NUMBER ONE ARTICULATING MYSELF HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR ME
I CAN'T DENY THAT THERE IS SOME WISDOM TO BE FOUND IN THE FOUR AGREEMENTS THEMSELVES BUT THIS BOOK IS THE SHORTEST BOOK THAT I'VE READ THAT I'VE FOUND MYSELF THINKING IT'S TOO LONG WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE FOUR AGREEMENTS LARGELY EXPLAIN THEMSELVES AND ANY AMBIGUITIES ABOUT EACH ONE CAN EASILY BE SUMMED UP IN A COUPLE OF SENTENCES SO WHY DO WE NEED A WHOLE BOOK EXPLAINING THEM A LOT OF THIS BOOK FELT LIKE FILLER THAT THEY PACKED IN SO THAT THEY COULD SELL IT AS A BOOK

ALL THE IMPORTANT PARTS COULD EASILY FIT IN A PAMPHLET
THIS BOOK IS A BLAST FROM THE PAST
I LEARNED THIS BOOK AT MY CHURCH GROWING UP UNITY WEST IN MILWAUKEE WI I TREASURE THOSE AGREEMENTS STILL TO THIS DAY SINCE I LEARNED OF IT WHEN I WAS YEARS OLD
ALL OF DON MIGUEL RUINS BOOKS ARE EXCELLENT THERES THE 5TH AGREEMENT THAT JUST GOES OVER THE FOUR AND THEN ADDS ANOTHER THE VOICE OF KNOWLEDGE AND THEN THE MASTERY OF LOVE ALL MUST READS

RUPAUL POSTED THIS EXCERPT A COUPLE DAYS AGO IT'S CRAZY THAT IT KEEPS POPPING UP MUST BE A SIGN TO DIG DEEPER HAHA
I TEND TO LOAN A LOT OF MY BOOKS OUT TO PEOPLE INTERESTED IN READING THEM THIS ONE'S BEEN LOST TO THE VOID I LOANED IT TO A FRIEND WHO LOANED IT TO A FRIEND ETC ETC I'M NOT MAD ABOUT IT EITHER IT'S QUITE AN ENJOYABLE READ
GREAT DISCUSSION AND GREAT BOOK
EXCEPT SOMETHINGS ARE VERY PERSONAL
JUST GOT THE BOOK NINE PAGES IN HAS ALREADY FUCKED ME UP
I DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK VERY MUCH THE AGREEMENTS ARE TRUISMS THAT CANNOT BE PRACTICED LITERALLY WITHOUT CAUSING SOME REAL TROUBLE ALONG THE WAY THE AUTHOR ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE A WEIRD GRUDGE AGAINST BUDDHISM THAT HE DOESN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF NOT TAKING PERSONALLY
SO WHEN YOU SAY HELPFUL WHAT DO YOU MEAN WITH THAT HELPFUL IN WHAT WAY

IM ASKING THIS BECAUSE I FIND THESE KINDS OF LESSONS EXTREMELY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IN THE CONTEXT OF PERSONAL GROWTH THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE THAT INSTEAD OF QUESTIONING THE WHY AND HOW OF TAKING THINGS PERSONALLY MAKING ASSUMPTIONS AND DOING YOUR BEST THEY SIMPLY SAY THAT WE SHOULD NOT DO THEM I THINK THAT IN MOST CASES IN SOME WAY QUESTIONING THINGS THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC IS BENEFICIAL AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED

TO BECOME AN ADAPTABLE AND GROWING PERSONA YOU NEED TO GET GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING WHEN SOMETHING IS ABSOLUTELY SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN PERSONALLY WHEN IT IS OKAY TO ASSUME SOMETHING AND EVEN FIND SITUATIONS WHERE DOING YOUR BEST WILL NOT WORK OUT TO YOUR OR BENEFIT IN THE LONG RUN

DONT BUY IN TO THESE KINDS OF SELF-HELP BOOKS GET OUT AND EXPERIENCE SHIT THAT MAKES YOU FIND A HELPFUL GRADIENT IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROBLEMS INSTEAD OF FORCING YOURSELF INTO A BLACK-AND-WHITE PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU DEVELOP AS A PERSON IF ONLY YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO QUESTION THEM
I DID NOT ENJOY READING THIS BOOK AT ALL IT'S SUPER REPETITIVE AND WAY TOO BASIC IT'S LIKE TALKING TO A YEAR-OLD ON HOW TO GROW UP I WAS GIVEN THIS BOOK AS A GIFT I READ IT AND THREW IT BACK AT THE PERSON WHO GAVE ME THE BOOK IT WAS OFFENSIVE TO ME TO HAVE SOMEONE GIVE ME THIS BOOK TO READ WHEN THE BOOK WAS INTENDED FOR THEMSELVES IF YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP THANKS BUT NO THANKS
EVERY SINGLE LAST PERSON I'VE MET WHO CLAIMS TO LOVE THE FOUR AGREEMENTS TALKS ABOUT THEM LIKE THEY'RE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THEM

I KNOW FALL-DOWN DRUNKS WHO ARE MORE HONEST
AMAZING BOOK AMAZING AUTHOR ALL HIS BOOKS ARE AMAZING
NUMBER 2 DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY THAT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE
ABOUT YEARS AGO I MOVED TO A NEW HOUSE IN LONDON I RENTED A ROOM FROM A GUY WHO WAS A BIT OF A HIPPY AND HE LIVED BY THIS BOOK HE BOUGHT ME A COPY AND TOLD HIM IT HELPED HIM BEAT HIS COKE ADDICTION
FOR FRENCH SPEAKERS THE TITLE OF THE BOOK IS LES ACCORDS TOLTEC
DON MIGUEL RUIZ IS A FRAUD DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PLASTIC SHAMAN
ALSO KNOWN AS HOW TO GET TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY ASSHOLES THIS IS HORRIBLE ADVICE WHEN YOU'RE NOT SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO ALL HAVE YOUR BEST INTEREST IN MIND

A BETTER RULE IS TREAT PEOPLE AS THEY TREAT YOU YOU REWARD KINDNESS WITH KINDNESS INDIFFERENCE WITH INDIFFERENCE AND AGGRESSION WITH AGGRESSION THIS HAS BEEN TESTED AND SHOWN TO BE THE BEST STRATEGY ACROSS MULTIPLE DOMAINS
I THINK THIS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LITTLE BIT TOO PREACHY IN SOME PARTS BUT IT IS DEFINITELY A GOOD READ MADE A BIG IMPACT ON MY LIFE BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I READ IT FOR THE FIRST TIME
TOM BRADY READS THIS EVERY YEAR
FUNNY STORY I THINK THAT THE MESSAGE THIS BOOK CONVEYS CAN BE VERY HELPFUL WHEN APPLIED CORRECTLY TO SOMEONE'S LIFE HOWEVER I LIVED WITH A ROOMMATE WHO DID IT COMPLETELY WRONG IMO

SHE WAS ALWAYS PRONE TO BEING THIN SKINNED AND JUST FLAT OUT BEING RUDE TO OTHER PEOPLE AFTER READING THE BOOK SHE WOULD SAY SOMETHING OR DO SOMETHING RUDE AF TO ONE OF US AND IN RESPONSE SAY WHY ARE YOU TAKING IT PERSONALLY WHEN SOMEBODY WOULD CALL HER OUT ON BEING RUDE AND IN TURN GETTING OFFENDED AND TAKING IT PERSONALLY

I JUST THINK ITS FUNNY HOW SOMEONE WITH A SKEWED PERSPECTIVE CAN TAKE SOMETHING THAT HAS THE POWER TO DO SO MUCH GOOD AND TURN IT AROUND TO CAUSE MORE SUFFERING
THIS IS SITTING ON MY BOSSES DESK RIGHT NOW I'LL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK
GOOD BOOK READ IT IN HIGH SCHOOL
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR POST I BOUGHT THE BOOK AND IT IS A REAL GEM I'LL GO BACK TO IT OVER AND OVER I CAN TELL
CHEERS
2 IS GREAT DEFINITELY A RECOMMENDED READ
I'VE READ THIS BOOK IT'S OF MY FAVORITES
I PREFER TO LIVE LIFE BY DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE
AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING LIKE AN ASSHOLE I WILL SAY PEOPLE SHOULD DRAW A DISTINCTION NOT ONLY BETWEEN FOLLOWING THIS ADVICE PRODUCES COMPARATIVELY FAVORABLE RESULTS AND THIS IS GOOD ADVICE BUT ALSO BETWEEN THIS IS GOOD ADVICE AND THIS ADVICE CAN BE FAVORABLY INTERPRETED

TO THE FIRST PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE ANECDOTES WITH HAPPY ENDINGS WHERE SELF-HELP IS CONCERNED AND YOU TYPICALLY SEE MORE SUCCESSES ON THE EXTREME END OF THE SCALE EAST G RECOVERY FROM DRUG ADDICTION HONESTLY WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING LIKE I OVERCAME LIFE DISASTER BY THE GRACE OF THIS SELF-HELP BOOK I FOUND WAS GIVEN I DON'T CHEER AGAINST THEIR VICTORY OR ANYTHING BUT I ALWAYS IMAGINE THAT WHEN YOU'RE AT A SUPER LOW POINT PRETTY MUCH ANY ALTERNATIVE IS WELCOME SO LIKE WHILE THE ADVICE ITSELF MAY NOT BE ESPECIALLY GOOD OR PHILOSOPHICALLY COMPLETE IT MIGHT FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER HELP YOU TO SAY STAY OFF HEROIN THE RESULT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF SO YOU AREN'T TOO PICKY IN HINDSIGHT ABOUT HOW YOU GOT THERE BECAUSE SLOPPY PHILOSOPHY THAT HELPS YOU STAY CLEAN IS BETTER THAN RELAPSING IT'S A LESSON IN NOT LETTING THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD

BUT THEN TO THE SECOND I DON'T WANT TO ATTRIBUTE ANY MORE PROFUNDITY TO THE ADVICE THAN IS NECESSARY I'VE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH SOME NEW AGE TYPES AND I'VE ENDED UP READING A LOT OF THAT STUFF JUST TO TRY AND GET INSIDE THE HEADS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO SELL ME ON IT I DID NOT FINISH THIS BOOK I GRANT THAT AND PART OF ME GETS THE IMPRESSION THESE LESSONS ARE TYPICALLY BOTH SIGNPOSTED AND EXPLAINED IN SUCH VAGUE LANGUAGE THAT WITH ENOUGH WILLPOWER AND CHARITABLE INTERPRETATION THE BARE PHRASING CAN BE RETROFITTED TO YOUR EXISTING BELIEFS IN A WAY THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING IS CLICKING OR LIKE YOU'RE HAVING AN AHA MOMENT

IT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WITH COLD READING INTUITIONS ARE PRIMED BY DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE SO YOU LATCH ON AND START PUMPING IN YOUR OWN INFORMATION AND YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOME KIND OF CONNECTION THERE WHEN IT'S REALLY JUST YOUR OWN THOUGHTS BEING REPACKAGED AND DELIVERED TO YOU I DON'T DENY THE POTENTIAL EFFICACY OF SELF-HELP BUT I DENY THE SOURCE OF THE ADVICE THE BENIGN THINGS THESE AGREEMENTS ARE BEING INTERPRETED AS INVOKING ARE THINGS I IMAGINE ALREADY OCCUR TO PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE ON SOME LEVEL EVEN IF THEY GET CAUGHT UP IN TRYING TO JUSTIFY DOING THE FUNDAMENTAL TAKEAWAY JUST SEEMS TO BE A SPECIAL CASE OF DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE IF YOU'RE KNOWN AS A SERIAL LIAR IF YOU'RE SUPER DISTRUSTFUL AND HOSTILE ALL THE TIME AND IF YOU EVERYTHING YOU DO YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE A BAD TIME THE REASON YOU SEE VIRTUES LIKE THESE BUBBLE UP IS BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY LATENT IF THERE'S A MORE ELOQUENT AND PACKAGING YOU CAN WRAP THEM UP IN TO REMIND PEOPLE OF SOMETHING THEY PROBABLY ALREADY UNDERSTAND DEEP DOWN MORE POWER TO THEM IF IT HELPS THEM GET OUT OF A DARK PLACE BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND IT'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY OR A GREAT WISDOM

I GUESS I'M TRYING TO LOOK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF EVERYONE COOPERATED AND WAS REALLY COMPASSIONATE AND STOIC ALL THE TIME BUT THE THING ABOUT MOST OF THE DISPASSIONATE SAGES IS THEY WEREN'T ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN WORLDLY AFFAIRS SO THOROUGH PRACTICE OF THEIR EXALTED VIRTUES WAS A GREAT STRATEGY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY REAL SKIN IN THE JUST ACCEPTED WHATEVER THE OUTCOME WAS SELF-SATISFIED THEIR DESTINY WAS IN THE HANDS OF NATURE OR FATE OR ONE OR MORE GODS SO WHATEVER WAY THINGS TURNED OUT WAS THE WAY THINGS EITHER MUST BE OR OUGHT TO BE BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IMMERSED IN THE WORLD BASIC VIRTUE TEMPLATES PROBABLY AREN'T ENOUGH BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO YOUR ENVIRONMENT TO MAKE IT SO YOUR STRATEGY HAS TO INVOLVE SHREWDNESS AND SOME AMOUNT OF RUTHLESS CALCULATION NEITHER OF WHICH THIS ADVICE PREPARES YOU FOR
IN MY HIGH SCHOOL AP ENGLISH CLASS WE USED THIS BOOK AS AN EXAMPLE OF A TERRIBLY WRITTEN BOOK WITH INTERESTING LESSONS TO DRAW FROM IT THE DISCUSSIONS AND FIERCE ARGUMENTS OVER THE COHERENCE OF THE BOOK WERE HILARIOUS
AS A SALESMAN I HAVE TO BE CREATIVE TO KEEP THIS ONE 2 I HAVE WON SALES BY MAKING IT PERSONAL I AM ALWAYS GETTING BURNED ON THIS I CAN'T DO EVERYTHING AND I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THE PERSON I HAND OFF TO WILL DO THERE PART I CAN DO THAT
ON 2 IF IT'S PERSONAL AND YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT PERSONALLY YOU'RE DELUDING YOURSELF

ON EVERYTHING WE KNOW COMES FROM ASSUMPTIONS
SELF HELP BOOKS JUST AREN'T MY CUP OF TEA I CAN UNDERSTAND IF SOMEONE IS STRUGGLING WITH SOMETHING IN THEIR LIVES BUT I PREFER AN INTERESTING WORK OF FICTION OR SCIENCE WRITINGS IF I'M GOING TO PICK UP A BOOK AND READ
THEY SHOULD MAKE THIS A BOOK HIGH SCHOOLERS READ BEFORE ENTERING COLLEGE IT WILL HELP THEM MATURE BEFORE SENDING THEM TO A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE SO MUCH FREEDOM THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN DO SAY ANYTHING
HAHAHAHAHA I AM STUCK ON SSI THAT MY FAMILY DEEPENS LN IF I EVER GET A JOB I GET NO MORE COLLEGE BENEFITS AND MY FAMILY IS THE ONE TO SUFFER I DESERVE NO FREEDOM I DESERVE TO GET RUN OVER BY A CAR OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL MY BRAIN IS FLATTED LIKE A PAN CAKE ON THE ASPHALT ROAD
SOUNDS LIKE MASONIC BULLSHIT
SOMEWHERE I HAD HEARD ABOUT THIS BOOK AND DID A LITTLE INTERSETTING ABOUT IT PREVIOUSLY THERE IS A FOLLOW UP CALLED THE FIFTH AGREEMENT WHICH IS BE SKEPTICAL BUT LEARN TO LISTEN SOURCE A COUPLE BLOGS AND AMAZON REVIEWS AD I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A COPY OF THE BOOK TAKE THAT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH

I THINK THAT FINAL PIECE ADDS TO THE OTHER FOUR BUT THIS POST HAS REALLY REMINDED ME I WANT TO READ BOTH OF THESE
THIS BOOK TURNED MY LIFE AROUND I WAS A TROUBLED TEEN IN A LOCKED DOWN BOARDING SCHOOL HAD NOT BEEN DOING WELL IN THERE AND THEN I FOUND THIS BOOK IN THE LIBRARY I READ IT IN A DAY AND STARTED APPLYING IT TO MY LIFE EVERYTHING HAA TURNED AROUND FOR ME SINCE THEN I'VE STAYED OUT OF TROUBLE GRADUATED COLLEGE WITH AN HONORS BATCHELOR DEGREE HAVE A GREAT GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT AREN'T TOXIC TO MY LIFE AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW IT WAS LIFE CHANGING AND I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ENOUGH PEOPLE IT LITERALLY SAVED ME FROM COMMITTING SUICIDE
BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOU WORD HUH
WELL I CAN SEE YOU HAVE LISTENED TO THAT ADVICE
4TH AGREEMENT OS OUT OF THE QUESTION BESIDES ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST WHO THE FUCK AM I BARBUTO SHOULD I SLEEP MY BEST TOO MAYBE GET HYPED ABOUT SLEEP THEN LOSE IT I CANNOT AND WILL NOT OPERATE AT ALL THE TIME UNLESS I CAN CONVINCE EVERYONE THAT MY IS ACTUALLY MY THEN SURE I WILL GIVE IT MY ALL THAT

DIDN'T LEMONY SNICKET DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH A PAGE FILLED ENTIRELY WITH ONE WORD
THE TALE IN ALICE IN WONDERLAND HERE



THE COUNTERFORCE


WHAT
RICHARD MASCULINE NIXON
THE FIRST PAGE OF TALE OF TWO CITIES IS PRETTY CLASSIC
WELL THE FIRST SENTENCE AT LEAST
ON PAGE OF THE PEOPLE OF PAPER BY SALVADOR PLASCENCIA THERE IS ONE WORD IT'S THE IN ITALICS THE REASON BEING

AND THIS FOLLOWING SECTION IS TAKEN FROM WIKIPEDIA SHE PLEADS WITH HIM IF YOU STILL LOVE ME PLEASE LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS STORY START THIS BOOK OVER WITHOUT ME AFTER THIS THE TITLE PAGE AND FIRST DEDICATION PAGE REAPPEAR BUT NOT THE DEDICATION PAGE FOR LIZ AN ABSENCE THAT SUGGESTS THE BOOK WILL START OVER WITHOUT REFERENCE TO LIZ END WIKI QUOTE

SO HE CALLS HER THAT NAME AND THE BOOK BEGINS AGAIN WITHOUT HER AND SANS THE DEDICATION PAGE WITH HER NAME ON IT SO MY CHOICE IS NOT ONLY ONE OF A SINGLE PAGE BUT ONE OF OMISSION AS WELL
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS QUESTION TO ME IS THAT THERE ARE SOME LEGITIMATE ANSWERS IN HERE PAGES ARE A FLUID CONCEPT AND CHANGE BASED ON WHICH EDITION YOU READ WHICH PUBLISHER IF YOU READ IT ON AN ETC BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAY LEGITIMATELY HAVE EUREKA MOMENTS AND A SINGLE PAGE STANDS OUT TO THEM
LEMONY SNICKET ONCE MORE THE COPYRIGHT PAGE OF HIS SO-CALLED UNAUTHORIZED AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS CLASSIC SNICKET

NO PART OF THIS BOOK MAY BE USED DESTROYED TAMPERED WITH OR EATEN WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF BRIEF POSSIBLY CODED QUOTATIONS EMBODIED IN CRITICAL ARTICLES REVIEWS AND SUBPOENAS

ET CETERA
THE PROBLEM IS THAT OFTEN TIMES THE SENTENCE OR PARAGRAPH CAN EXCEED THE LENGTH OF A PAGE OR PERHAPS THE CONTENT THAT WOULD MAKE IT AN EXCELLENT PAGE STARTS HALF OR EVEN OF THE WAY DOWN WHICH MAKES IT LIKELY THAT IT WILL RUN ON INTO THE NEXT PAGE

EDIT THAT BEING SAID THE FIRST PAGE OF BLOOD MERIDIAN IS PRETTY FREAKING GREAT
TOWARDS THE END OF TERRY REAPER MANUAL THERE IS A PAGE WHERE DEATH TRIES TO REASON FOR COMPASSION TO AREAL HE ARGUES THAT LIFE SHOULD BE TENDED FOR AND LOOKED AFTER BEFORE IT IS TAKEN AND ASKS FOR MORE TIME TO FINISH HIS WORK
THE NEXT PAGE IS JUST YES AS A FULL PAGE
I REALLY LOVE THE CHAPTER OF DON QUIXOTE WHEN HE DECLARES I KNOW WHO I AM SAME THING FOR THE RHAPSODY OF THE ILIAD WHEN GLAUCUS MET DIOMEDES ON THAT CHAPTER OF DON QUIXOTE HE MADE A HUGE STATEMENT ABOUT HIS LITERARY MADNESS AS AN OPPOSITION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD ON THE ILIAD DIOMEDES AND GLAUCUS MAKE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY BUT
THIS PAGE FROM INDEPENDENT PEOPLE BY HALALCOR LAXNESS HAS ALWAYS STOOD OUT TO ME THE LAST SENTENCES FROM THE CHAPTER ENDING ON THIS PAGE HAVE BEEN STUCK IN MY HEAD EVER SINCE I READ THE BOOK YEARS AGO THE BOY AND ETERNITY TWO FRIENDS THE SKY CLOUDLESS AND UNENDING YES

THE ENTIRE PAGE CAPTURES ONE OF THE MAYOR CONFLICTS IN THE BOOK QUITE WELL TOO THE CHARM OF THE OLD SIMPLE WORLD WHERE EVERYONE IS THEIR OWN MASTER ENDING CHAPTER VERSUS THE NEW ECONOMIC REALITY OF CAPITALISM AND THRALDOM TO THE BIG COMPANIES BEGINNING CHAPTER
GREAT GATSBY WHEN HE DISCUSSES THE DRESSES IN THE SUMMER HOUSE LIKE SAILS ON THE WATER IT'S A PAGE THAT ALWAYS STUNS ME


AND


THERE IS A PAGE IN BOOK OF FISH BY RICHARD FLANAGAN WHERE THE CONVICT WILLIAM BUELOW GOULD GOES ON ABOUT HOW HE IS FILLED WITH LOVE FOR LIFE THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING I'M PARAPHRASING BECAUSE IT'S A LONG PASSAGE YOU DID SAY PAGE RIGHT AND ALSO BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER IT EXACTLY
IT'S JUST SIMPLY AMAZING YOU HAVE THIS CONVICT IN A PENAL COLONY WHERE SOME OF THE WORST INHUMANITY MANKIND HAS INFLICTED UPON ITSELF IS GOING ON AND HE HAS THIS MOMENT WHERE HE IS CONNECTED WITH EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING AND IS FILLED WITH JOY AND LOVE
I PAGES LIKE THESE SET DOWN THE BOOK PASSAGES THE KIND OF THING WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO KEEP READING YOU JUST WANT TO SET DOWN THE BOOK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST READ FOR A WHILE WHERE YOUR HEART IS JUST SO FULL OF WONDER THAT EVEN ANOTHER PAGE MORE MIGHT CAUSE SOME OF IT TO SPILL OVER AND BE LOST BOOK OF FISH IS A BOOK WITH NOT A FEW OF THOSE MOMENTS OTHERS HAVE NOTED THE GREAT GATSBY AS ANOTHER LITTLE BIG BY JOHN CROWLEY IS SO STUFFED FULL OF THEM THAT YOU COULD EASILY READ A CHAPTER AT A TIME AND CALL EACH ONE A COMPLETE TALE IN ITS OWN RIGHT

I DUNNO ABOUT THE BEST PAGES IN ALL OF LITERATURE BUT I REALLY ENJOYED THAT HOUSE OF LEAVES KEPT UP ALL OF ITS NOVELTY THROUGHOUT THE COVER PAGES AND COPYRIGHT PAGES
ANY OF THE LAST FEW PAGES IN PART SEVEN OF ANNA KARENINA I JUST FINISHED THE BOOK AND THOSE PAGES WERE SOME OF THE GREATEST I EVER READ
I GOT EXCITED THEN READ THE ARTICLE IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST KING BOOKS I READ BUMMER
I ALWAYS FIND HIS SHORT STORIES THE BEST HE SOMETIMES JUST GOES ON AND ON I COULDNT FINISH TOMMYKNOCKERS FOR THAT REASON ALSO DESPERATION
FOR ME SKELETON CREW IS STILL THE BEST
OF THE BACHMAN BOOKS ROADWORK IS THE ONE I REREAD MOST OFTEN I JUST SYMPATHIZE WITH BURTS SLOW DECLINE INTO RAGE HIS LIFE FALLS APART NOT THROUGH SPECTACULARLY OFFENSIVE ACTION BUT STEADY INACTION THE LONG WALK IS GREAT I'M DYING TO REREAD RAGE BUT HAVEN'T STUMBLED ACROSS A COPY
TITLE SHOULD BE THE BEST STEPHEN KING BOOK YOU SHOULD NEVER READ
NOT BECAUSE IT ISN'T WELL WRITTEN OR THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A TIGHT PLOT OR THAT THE CHARACTERS AREN'T BELIEVABLE OR THAT THE SITUATION IT PORTRAYS IS THAT FAR FETCHED THAT IT COULDN'T CONCEIVABLY COME TO BE
BUT BECAUSE HOLY CRAP WILL IT LEAVE YOU WITH A GAPING HOLE IN YOUR SOUL I ROUTINELY LUMP THIS IN A CATEGORY CALLED BOOKS THAT I WISH I COULD AMERICAN PSYCHO IS ANOTHER THE ROAD TOPS THE LIST I THINK THESE ARE AMAZING BUT DISTURBING WORKS THAT I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND TO BE BANNED BURNED SUPPRESSED BUT THAT I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND FOR READING
I JUST FINISHED THIS BOOK YESTERDAY I AM STILL DIGESTING IT BUT I REALLY ENJOYED IT
THE ONE I NEVER SEE MENTIONED IS THE DARK HALF AND THATS MY FAVOURITE KING BOOK THAT I'VE READ
HUGE FAN OF THE DARK TOWER SERIES SO FAR I'M ONLY ON BOOK THREE THOUGH
I READ IT AND LIKED IT FOR THE MOST PART THE ENDING SEEMED A BIT RUSHED TO ME
GOOD JOB ON PICKING THIS ONE UP IT'S A CLASSIC SORRY YOU'VE HEARD BAD THINGS ABOUT BURROUGHS I'VE HONESTLY NEVER READ ANYTHING BY HIM I DIDN'T LIKE PROJECTS NOT WITHSTANDING FOR AN ADDED DIMENSION CHECK OUT THE AUDIO BOOK VERSION WHERE BURROUGHS HIMSELF READS THE TEXT HIS VOICE AND HEARING THE INFLECTION HE ASCRIBES HIS CHARACTERS JUST MAKES IT THAT MUCH BETTER ENJOY
A KEY TO A GOOD APPRECIATION OF BURROUGHS IS KNOWING WHERE HE CAME FROM THE REASON SO MANY PEOPLE COMMENT NEGATIVELY UPON HIS WORK IS THAT THEY ENTER INTO IT EXPECTING SOME ENTERTAINING STORY WHEN REALLY IT'S QUITE TOUGH WORK TO READ IT THERE ARE SO MANY OBSCURE INFLUENCES AND HIS HUMOR IS SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE SIMPLY DON'T GET I LOVE HIS WORK AND I'M GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT TOO AND THE OTHERS IN THIS THREAD

HIS FASCINATIONS WITH SCIENTOLOGY MAYANS CONTROL LEMURS AND SO ON ARE KEYS TO GETTING INTO HIS WORK AND REALLY APPRECIATING IT ALSO JUST KNOWING THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT HE SAYS IS INTENDED AS A JOKE OF SORTS LISTEN TO HIS READINGS AND YOU'LL FIND THE ENJOYMENT GOES FURTHER HE'S A MASTER OF DEADPAN

ALSO CHECK OUT THE BIOGRAPHIES AS HE LIVED A FASCINATING LIFE THE NEWEST ONE BY BARRY MILES IS PROBABLY THE BEST
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO READ NAKED LUNCH OR JUNKIE FOR AWHILE NOW SO KEEP US UPDATED
DO NOT POST SHALLOW CONTENTION

I'M SORRY BUT YOUR POST CURRENTLY COUNTS AS SHALLOW CONTENTION DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY ABOUT THE BOOK THAT YOU COULD EDIT INTO THE TEXT PREFERABLY YOUR OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT THE BOOK OR AT THE LEAST A DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK WITHOUT SPOILERS

LET ME KNOW IF YOU EDIT IT I CAN REINSTATE YOUR POST
I M THAT ANNOYING JERK WHO KEEPS BUGGING YOU TO READ INFINITE JEST

MAYBE BUT A HOLIDAY BINGE READ IT TOOK ME MONTHS
LONG HOLIDAY STRETCHES
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
CAN CONCUR DAHLGREN IS GREAT FOR NOT SURE YOU CAN FINISH IT ANY OTHER WAY
NO ASOCIAL OR MALAYAN THOSE ARE THE FIRST THINGS THAT CAME TO MIND
THANKS FOR THIS
IN THE BEGINNING THE UNIVERSE WAS CREATED THIS HAS MADE A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY ANGRY AND BEEN WIDELY REGARDED AS A BAD MOVE
THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE
BY DOUGLAS ADAMS
HAVE A LISTEN TO THE RADIO PLAY AS WELL ITS BRILLIANT
I REALLY HOPE THEY MAKE A MOVIE OUT OF IT SOME DAY
THERE ARE SOME GOOD QUALITIES TO BUT IS THE SCI-FI PART OF IT REALLY ONE OF THEM IT IS IMAGINATIVE CREATIVE AND SILLY BUT IS THERE ANY SCIENCE BEHIND IT IN THE TRADITION OF GREAT SCI-FI

IF ANYTHING IT'S A LAMPOONING OF TRADITIONAL
I'VE BEEN SITTING ON THIS ONE FOR A WHILE READ A BIT OF THE FIRST ONE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND GOT SIDETRACKED BY ANOTHER BOOK THIS CONVINCED ME GRABBING THE KINDLE VERSION NOW
I LOVED THE SERIES BUT I WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME TO STOP BEFORE I READ THE LAST BOOK THOUGH THAT ENDING WAS DEFINITELY NOT UP TO PAR W THE REST OF THE SERIES
YOU SAY YOU'VE BECOME VERY CYNICAL SOME ADVICE THE ONLY WAY I SURVIVED TO OLD AGE AS A CYNIC WAS PLENTY OF COMEDY AND PLENTY OF FANTASY LIBERALLY APPLIED THEY SOFTEN THE EDGES OF CYNICISM REALISM
SO SOME PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU SKIP MOSTLY HARMLESS BECAUSE THEY HATE IT EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE IN AGREEMENT THAT SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH IS GREAT AND MAYBE IT BECAME A BIT OF A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW

I LIKE MOSTLY HARMLESS AND WILL TELL YOU TO READ IT YEAH IT'S A BIT OF A STRANGE ENDING TO THE WHOLE THING AND SOME OF THE NARRATIVE CHOICES ARE OUT OF THE BLUE BUT IF YOU LIKE THE WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN FEELING OF SCI-FI THEN I THINK THE CONCLUSION WILL BE FOR YOU
ONE OF THE PERKS OF OWNING A BOOK STORE SIGNED COPIES OF HIS BOOKS
R BOOKSCIRCLEJERK
GET TO THE FIFTH PART WHERE IT BECOMES SCIENCE FACT
EVEN I DIDN'T REALISE THAT UNTIL I LEARNT ABOUT QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION AT UNI
LIKE A LOT OF SERIOUS SCIENCE FICTION IT FOCUSES ON PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES AS MUCH AS IT DOES ON ANY SO-CALLED SCIENCE I RECENTLY READ HYPERION THE FIRST IN ANOTHER SERIES AND WAS CONSTANTLY REMINDED OF SATIRICAL TAKE ON GOD THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING SIMMONS MUST HAVE READ THE HITCHHIKER SERIES SURELY
FUN FACT THE THIRD BOOK STARTED OUT AS AN EPISODE OF DOCTOR WHO
AS A SCI-FI FAN I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIES AND HAD TO PUT IT DOWN MULTIPLE TIMES JUST FOR A BREATHER I'M GLAD I PICKED IT UP BECAUSE IT HAD ITS MOMENTS BUT IT REALLY ISN'T FOR EVERYONE DIFFERENT STROKES I GUESS
YOU CAN'T BEAT THE TRILOGY OF ALTHOUGH IT DOES LEAVE YOU THINKING THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO IT
ON A SIDENOTE ALAN RICKMAN AS THE VOICE OF MARVIN IS HOW I WILL FOREVER HEAR HIM NO MATTER WHAT THE MEDIUM
IT'S REALLY GENIUS THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT'S JUST GOOD AND FUNNY AT THE SAME TIME
I'M A MATH MAJOR AND HE SAYS VERY INSIGHTFUL THINGS I LOVE BISTROMATHEMATICS HIS BROWNIAN MOTION IT'S AWESOME
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE BOOK TO ME I READ IT BUT PROBABLY DIDNT UNDERSTAND IT SINCE I DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL

I DIDNT FIND THE HUMOUR THAT CAME WITH COMPLETE RANDOMNESS AND STUFF LIKE THAT FUNNY AT ALL I CAN SEE IT WORKING FOR SOMEONE THOUGH WAS THE HUMOUR ABOUT THINGS JUST BEING REALLY RANDOM AND OUT OF NORMAL SUPPOSED TO BE THAT FUNNY I JUST ACTUALLY GOT QUITE DISGUSTED BY THE BOOK MIDWAY READING IT

THAT BOOK ALSO HAS GOTTEN SO MUCH PRAISE THAT I THINK I HAVE JUST MISSED THE WHOLE BOOK FROM PAGE TO THE END COVER WHATS THE DEAL HERE
I FIND HIS AIRY AND QUIRKY STYLE TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN LAMPSHADING POOR WRITING AND PLANNING IT'S NOT FUNNY WHEN YOU REALIZE THE GUY REALLY WAS JUST MAKING IT ALL UP AS HE WENT THE IMPROBABILITY DRIVE MIGHT AS WELL BE CALLED THE MAGICAL LITERARY DEVICE OF EXPEDIENCE AND IN THAT VEIN NO THE SCI FI ISNT ESPECIALLY GOOD IT'S ESPECIALLY BAD IT'S ALL FI AND NO SCIENCE
PEOPLE WATCHED ON TV FOR YEARS I NEVER LIKED IT ITS MENT TO BE A CLASSIC
BORGES LIBRARY OF BABEL
UNSEEN UNIVERSITY NATCH
HOGWARTS HAD THE BEST LIBRARY
THE NAME OF THE ROSE
AS I RECALL LIBRARY WAS PRETTY PIMP
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A LIBRARY BUT MR HOUR BOOKSTORE FEATURES A VERY ENCHANTING UNIQUE PLOT REGARDING BOOKSTORES AND THE STORAGE OF BOOKS IN WAYS BOTH MAGICAL AND DIGITAL
THE LIBRARY OF DREAM IN THE SANDMAN SERIES BY NEIL CAIMAN WOULD BE PRETTY COOL IT HAS ALL THE UNPUBLISHED WORKS ALTERNATIVE WORKS AND CONTINUING WORKS BY AUTHORS LIVING AND DEAD
THE LIBRARY AT MOUNT CHAR
DOES THE ENTIRETY OF JASPER TUESDAY NEXT BOOKS COUNT
THE ARCHIVE IN KING-KILLER CHRONICLE NO WINDOWS USES MAGIC SYMPATHY LAMPS FOR LIGHT SOURCES AS FIRE CAN PUT THE BOOKS AT RISK USES UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AS VENTILATION TO DELIVER AIR INTO THE BUILDING SO THE PAPER DOESN'T BECOME TO BRITTLE HAS TONS OF DIFFERENT MATERIAL FROM TRADITIONAL BOOKS TO STORY KNOTS LITERATURE FROM THE ILLISH WRITTEN DOWN BY TYING KNOTS INTO ROPE CLAY TABLETS SCROLLS AND MORE IT ALSO HAS AN ENTIRE SECTION OF PEOPLE DEDICATED TO IT THAT GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND HUNT DOWN RARE BOOKS THE ARCHIVE IS PRETTY LEGIT
THE GREAT LIBRARY OF GRANTOR
BOOKS AND BAUBLES

NOT EXACTLY A LIBRARY BUT CLOSE ENOUGH
I THINK THE RAW SHARK TEXTS HAD SOME POINTS ALONG WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELLING THROUGH UNUSED SECTIONS THAT ALWAYS SEEM TO EXIST ON LIBRARY SHELVING EVERYWHERE
LIBRARY FROM THE SANDMAN
THE CEMETERY OF LOST BOOKS FROM THE SHADOW OF THE WIND
THE BLACK LIBRARY FROM WARHAMMER OR WAN SHI LIBRARY FROM AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER LEGEND OF FORRA
THE LIBRARY AT MOUNT CHAR BY SCOTT HAWKINS I WON'T SAY MUCH FOR FEAR OF SPOILERS BUT IT'S A FANTASTIC LIBRARY AND AN EVEN BETTER BOOK
IN TERMS OF LIBRARIANSHIP THE LIBRARY FROM SHADES OF GREY
IN TERMS OF MATERIALS THE LIBRARY FROM SABOTEUR
DAVID LIBRARY OF COURSE BEST IN THE FIVE GALAXIES
THE THE LIBRARY FROM DOCTOR WHO IT CONTAINED EVERY BOOK EVER WRITTEN AND ITS CARETAKER WAS THE DOCTOR MOON
I JUST FINISHED MY READ THIS YEAR MY ORIGINAL GOAL WAS

I SHOULD PROBABLY GET A LIFE
I'M A DIRTY CHEATER

I ACTUALLY SET MINE AT BOOKS AT THE START OF THE YEAR ONE A MONTH IT'LL BE EASY HOWEVER I MANAGED TO GET THERE QUITE QUICKLY SINCE THAT POINT I'VE BEEN UPPING MY READING CHALLENGE BY AROUND BOOKS OR SO EVERY TIME I GET WITHIN BOOK OF FINISHING

AT THIS POINT I'M AT OF I DON'T EXPECT TO EDIT MY CHALLENGE AGAIN BY THE END OF THE YEAR SO I'LL PROBABLY END AT

THIS IS QUITE A GOOD WAY OF MOTIVATING YOURSELF TO READ AS YOU ALWAYS HAVE A GOAL WITHIN REACH I TRIED TO DO BOOKS LAST YEAR AND JUST FOUND THE GOAL TO BE SO FAR AWAY THAT THE CHALLENGE DIDN'T MOTIVATE ME AT ALL
PLANNED TO READ BOOKS THIS YEAR A BOOK A WEEK CURRENTLY AT AND AM IN THE MIDDLE OF FOUR BOOKS PRETTY SURPRISED AND HAPPY ABOUT MY PROGRESS
I CONSERVATIVELY PUT MINE AT BOOKS AND AM CURRENTLY AT I'M GOING TO FIX THIS BY UPPING TO A WHOPPING BOOKS NEXT YEAR

I THINK MY BIGGEST GOAL IS JUST TO FINISH MY CURRENTLY READING LIST I'M AT CURRENTLY READING RIGHT NOW INCLUDING AROUND BOOKS AT THE DONE MARK I'D LIKE TO START WITH A CLEAN SLATE
I'VE STOPPED TRACKING MY GOODREADS CHALLENGE I PROBABLY WON'T EVEN TAKE UP THE CHALLENGE NEXT YEAR ONWARDS

THE REASON FOR THIS IS I REALIZED THAT BECAUSE OF TAKING THESE CHALLENGES FOR THE LAST YEARS I UNCONSCIOUSLY GRAVITATE TOWARDS SHORTER READS SO AS TO HELP ME REACH MY READING GOAL FASTER

THIS YEAR ONWARDS I WANT TO GET INTO SOME LONGER WORKS LIKE RUSSIAN LITERATURE INFINITE JEST ETC MY NEW READING MEASUREMENT IS READING PAGES IN A YEAR PAGES A MONTH SO FAR I'M AT PAGES FOR SO HOPING TO ACHIEVE IT WITH TIME TO SPARE
ATM I SHOULD PROBABLY AIM A BIT HIGHER NEXT YEAR
JUST STARTED GETTING INTO THE HABIT OF READING AGAIN IT HAD BEEN YEARS SINCE I PICKED UP A BOOK AND AT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER I DECIDED TO CHANGE THAT I SET MY GOAL AT BOOKS SINCE THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME LEFT IN THE YEAR AT BOOKS SO FAR IN NOVEMBER

I'M CURRENTLY AT WITH AT LEAST OVER HALF DONE AND READY TO BE FINISHED I THINK I'LL STILL SHOOT FOR THE I HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT I HOPE TO FINISH DOROTHY MUST DIE BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'LL DO WITH THE OTHER 2 I'LL PROBABLY JUST PICK UP SOME RANDOM BOOK LAYING AROUND I HAD GREAT PLANS FOR MY THANKSGIVING VACATION AND THAT DIDN'T EXACTLY WORK OUT GREAT
I THOUGHT I COULD READ THIS YEAR
WHICH IS CLOSE TO PREVIOUS YEARS
HOWEVER I REALIZE I USUALLY READ SEVERAL SMALL BOOKS OF POETRY OR NORMAL SIZE WHICH ARE QUICK READS GENERALLY
THIS YEAR NOT SO MUCH SO I AM AT
I AM CURRENTLY READING ABOUT BOOKS SIMULTANEOUSLY SO IT IS CONCEIVABLY POSSIBLE I COULD MAKE IT
BY BOLAN DISAPPOINTING SO FAR I READ IT EVERY DAY ON MY WAY TO WORK AND I THINK I WILL GET IT DONE ON TIME

SET IT AT I'VE READ AND FIGURE I'LL END UP AT ON THE YEAR GONNA SHOOT FOR IN REALLY HAPPY WITH THIS YEAR I REALLY GOT MYSELF BACK INTO READING AS MY MAIN HOBBY FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT
I HAVE READ OUT OF MY POINT LIST BUT I'VE PUT SOME REALLY SERIOUS BOOKS IN THERE THAT I WAS NOT READY TO READ YET OR JUST NOT IN THE MOOD FOR I FEEL JUSTIFIED THOUGH BECAUSE I ALSO READ LIKE THAT WEREN'T ON THE LIST IN THE FIRST PLACE XD I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF NOW ON THE LIST I HAVE LEFT

THE HUNCHBACK OF
KING LEAR
THE BIBLE
YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING PUTTING THE BIBLE IN THERE I KNOW I WILL NOT READ IT NOW YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT BY SAYING I HAVE SERIOUS BOOKS IN THERE I'M GONNA TRY TO READ 2 OR BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND FOR THE NEXT LIST REMEMBER TO STICK TO IT

I'VE READ OF MY I COUNTED THE BOOKS THAT I READ MY CHILDREN THIS YEAR SINCE ON THE OTHER HAND MOST OF OTHER READS WERE QUITE LARGE AND TOOK MORE TIME THAN USUAL
LAST YEAR I BEAT MY GOODREADS READING GOAL BY A FEW BOOKS AND THIS YEAR I DECIDED TO SET THE SAME GOAL BOOKS FOR THE YEAR THE THINKING BEING A BOOK EVERY TWO WEEKS OR SO

HOWEVER I THEN DECIDED TO FINALLY TACKLE READING THE MASTER AND MARGARITA IN RUSSIAN AND THAT TOOK ME LIKE 2 MONTHS TO FINISH I'M CURRENTLY AT BOOKS READ FOR THE YEAR AND UNLESS I PRETTY MUCH DON'T DO ANYTHING ELSE IN DECEMBER BUT READ I DON'T THINK I'LL REACH THE GOAL THIS YEAR

ALL OF THIS ALSO HAS ME THINKING OF WHAT I SHOULD DO FOR NEXT YEAR I WANT TO SET IT TO AGAIN BUT I ALSO WANT TO READ WAR AND PEACE AND MAYBE ANNA KARENINA AND SOME OTHER RUSSIAN CLASSICS ALL IN RUSSIAN SO I MAY BE PUSHING IT WITH THAT
MY GOAL WAS BOOKS AND I'VE READ

WITH ANY LUCK I'LL DO BETTER NEXT YEAR
SET A GOAL OF BOOKS IN WITH AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT SOME OF THEM HAD TO BE ALL-TIME GREATS I PICKED MOBY DICK AS REQUIRED READING WHICH TOOK ME ABOUT A MONTH TO FINISH AND THE BURNOUT AFTERWARDS TOOK ME ANOTHER MONTH I FINALLY FINISHED THE CHALLENGE YESTERDAY WITH CHERNOBYL PRAYER BY SVETLANA ALEXEIEVICH WHICH WAS AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING CHOICE FOR BOOK

I'M HAPPY THAT I DID BUT I SOMETIMES FELT LIKE READING BOOKS BECAME JUST ANOTHER CHORE I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO FOR BUT I THINK I MIGHT LOWER THE GOAL A LITTLE BIT SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO FORCE MYSELF TO READ
I HAD AND DONE ABOUT BUT AROUND OF THOSE ARE COMICS AND MANGA
I WANTED TO READ AND I'M AT SOMETHING I THINK MY LIST FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR WAS

THE HANGING TREE BY BEN AARONOVITCH
END BY LIU BIXIN
THE WALL OF STORMS BY KEN LIU
THE FIREMAN BY JOE HILL

BUT I'VE HAD THAT SAME LIST FOR A WHOLE MONTH AND I'VE JUST BEEN READING OTHER STUFF INSTEAD LOL
MY GOAL WAS AND I AM UP TO I DID VERY WELL THIS YEAR WITH PLENTY OF TRAVEL AND MUCH LESS TV AS WELL I ALSO LISTEN TO BOOKS MOSTLY SELF-IMPROVEMENT ONES IN THE CAR AS WELL SOME OF MY HIGHLIGHTS THIS YEAR WERE SHANTARAM WHICH TOOK A WHILE TO READ BUT WAS GREAT THE RED RISING TRIOLOGY GRIT AND NOW I AM ENRAPTURED BY THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO SERIES
I'VE MET MY TOTAL BOOK COUNT BUT THERE ARE A FIVE MORE BOOKS THAT I WANTED TO READ THIS YEAR SO I WONT CONSIDER MYSELF REALLY DONE UNTIL THOSE ARE COMPLETED THE BOOKS I HAVE READ INCLUDE THREE GRAPHIC NOVELS AND A COUPLE OF NOVELLAS SO IT IS A LESS IMPRESSIVE NUMBER THAN IT LOOKS BUT IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE READING YEAR AND I'M VERY HAPPY BOTH WITH THE AMOUNT I'VE READ AND WHAT I'VE READ THIS YEAR
I'M AT WITH 2 PER WEEK MY GOAL I WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO READ LESS THAN THE PAST TWO YEARS WHEN I'VE GONE OVER BECAUSE I'M IN THE SECOND YEAR OF GRAD SCHOOL STEM TOTALLY NOT THE KIND OF THING YOU NEED TO DO A LOT OF NOVEL-READING FOR NEXT YEAR I'M HOPING TO MOVE ON TO A PHD SO MAYBE I'LL HAVE TO CUT MYSELF BACK TO PER WEEK
HAVE FUN WITH THE TRILOGY

I SET THE GOAL FOR BOOKS THIS YEAR I'M UP TO HOWEVER OF THOSE ARE GRAPHIC NOVELS AND ART BOOKS THAT TOOK ABOUT MINUTES EACH TO READ SO I'M HOPING TO REPLACE THOSE WITH BOOKS

I'M DETERMINED TO AT LEAST HIT BY THE END OF THE YEAR BUT I'M GOING TO TRY MY HARDEST TO HIT
COMPLETED MY GOAL OF READING BOOKS IN THEIR SYSTEM THOUGH THERE'S MORE STUFF I'VE READ THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A PAGE

MIGHT UP IT TO FOR NEXT YEAR
I PUT DOWN SINCE WHAT WITH UNI AND ME BEING A LAZY GOOD FOR NOTHING I FIGURED I WOULDN'T GO PAST CURRENTLY AT I'VE GOT A BUNCH OF FAMOUS CLASSICS THAT I FIGURED I'D READ SINCE SEEMINGLY EVERYONE'S READ THEM

STUFF LIKE JANE EYRE DRACULA FRANKENSTEIN TALE OF TWO CITIES
I'M CURRENTLY AT THIS IS THE MOST I'VE READ IN A YEAR

FINALLY SPLURGING ON A KINDLE PAPER-WHITE AND JOINING A COUPLE OF GROUP CHALLENGES THIS YEAR MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE

I'VE JUST COMPLETED THE CHALLENGE BUT I'M STILL ABOUT BOOKS BEHIND THE AROUND THE YEAR IN BOOKS CHALLENGE AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE I WON'T BE ABLE TO FINISH THE SECOND CHALLENGE IN TIME

THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR FOR
YOU FINISH YOUR EXAMS ON MY BIRTHDAY HAHA

MY READING HAS BLOWN DOWN THIS WEEK AND I HAVEN'T READ AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE BUT I'VE READ BOOKS THIS YEAR AND MY GOAL WAS IF I DIDN'T HAD THAT MONTH NO READING GAP I GONE THROUGH MAYBE OR EVENING BUT I'VE GOT SOME GOOD STUFF LINED UP FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AND EVEN BETTER FOR THE NEXT
I STARTED OUT WITH BOOKS BUT I'VE READ A FAIR NUMBER OF GRAPHIC NOVELS THIS YEAR SO I GRADUALLY BUMPED IT UP TO RIGHT NOW I'M AT AND I'M HALFWAY THROUGH TWO BOOKS HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN SLOW GOING WITH THEM ALL THE UGLINESS AND NEGATIVITY GOING ON WITH THE ELECTION REALLY DEPRESSED ME AND I GET INTO ANYTHING FOR WEEKS I'M FINALLY PICKING THE TWO BOOKS BACK UP LOT BY STEPHEN KING AND THE NORDIC THEORY OF EVERYTHING IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE BY ANU PARTAKEN I SHOULD FINISH THEM BOTH IN A WEEK OR TWO
I'VE NEVER DONE A CHALLENGE BEFORE I'VE ALWAYS JUST READ WHEN I COULD BUT MY SCHEDULE IS SO BUSY THAT I DON'T READ ENOUGH I THINK I'LL SET MY CHALLENGE TO BOOKS AND ADD MORE IF I HOPEFULLY SURPASS THAT NUMBER AND I'LL INCLUDE DECEMBER IN WITH SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M RARING TO JUMP INTO IT I'M ABOUT TO START THE GIRLS BY EMMA CLINE SO I SUPPOSE THIS WILL BE THE BEGINNING OF MY CHALLENGE
FOR MY READING CHALLENGE SO FAR I THINK I MIGHT ATTEMPT FOR MY GOAL I HAVE A FEW BOOKS LEFT TO FINISH IN INCLUDING

SPILLOVER BY DAVID QUARMEN

THE GIRL WITH ALL THE GIFTS BY MASCULINE ROYAL CAREY

THIS BY CHINA MIDVILLE
TERRIBLE PLANNED TO READ BOOKS SAME AS LAST YEAR AND HAVE JUST READ
OUT OF I JUST STARTED DO NOT RESUSCITATE BY NICHOLAS PONTICELLO WHICH WILL BRING ME TO I DON'T REALLY PLAN WHAT TO READ NEXT JUST FINISH WHAT I'M READING AND SEE WHAT I'M IN THE MOOD FOR AFTERWARD NOTHING LONGER THAN PAGES TO MAKE SURE I MEET MY GOAL THOUGH

I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO DO THE CHALLENGE NEXT YEAR MAYBE I'LL SET THE BAR LOW AND READ ONLY BOOKS NEARING PAGES MY HUSBAND BOUGHT ME A COPY OF HOUSE OF LEAVES AND I HAVE A FEELING BETWEEN THAT AND BOOK ONE OF THE FAMILIAR MARK GOING TO BE MESSING UP MY AVERAGE FOR NEXT YEAR
CURRENTLY AT

I KIND OF STALLED OUT IN THE SUMMER ONLY READ FOUR BOOKS IN THOSE FOUR MONTHS BUT GOT BACK ON TRACK ONCE MY COMMUTE STARTED BACK UP 2 TO HOURS EVERY WEEKDAY HELPS A SISTER OUT A LOT TO GET SOME READING TIME IN

ALSO WHEN I CAN SPEND HOURS READING AT WORKS IS NICE

DON'T GET TOO DOWN ABOUT NOT REACHING YOUR GOAL I BELIEVE IN YOU AND AM PROUD OF WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED THIS YEAR REMEMBER TO DRINK LOTS OF WATER DURING FINALS EAT GOOD MEALS AND GET PLENTY OF REST BEFORE YOUR EXAMS DON'T DO ALL NIGHTERS STUDIES SHOW THAT THOSE ARE BAD FOR YOU

THINKING I MIGHT GET THROUGH CHIGOZIE THE FISHERMEN AND ADAM FORTUNE SMILES IN THE NEXT MONTH WE'LL SEE THERE'S NO HURRY

I SPENT SOME TIME STARTING INFINITE JEST WHICH I DID NOT FINISH AND AM NOT COUNTING TOWARDS THE GOAL THIS YEAR I FOUND WHAT I READ OF INFINITE JEST TO BE AMAZING BUT I WAS DISTRACTED BY A VACATION AND THEN JUST FELL OUT OF THE RHYTHM OF READING THAT BOOK IT DOES SEEM TO REQUIRE CONCENTRATION HOPE TO TRY IT AGAIN NEXT YEAR

I WILL NOT HIT MY GOAL THIS YEAR BUT I AM HOPING TO FINISH ANOTHER BOOK OR TWO BY THE END OF THE YEAR
I'M AT AFTER GOING LAST YEAR I USUALLY HAVE BOOKS GOING AT A TIME BUT STARTING IN SEPTEMBER I FOOLISHLY SET UP A PERFECT STORM WITH TRILOGY MOLLOY MALONE DIES AND THE UNNAMABLE WITHIN A BUDDING GROVE VOLUME 2 OF IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME AND THE ENNEADS OF PLOTINUS MY PROGRESS CAME TO A SCREECHING HALT UNDER THE WEIGHT OR DENSITY OF THESE THREE BOOKS I JUST FINISHED BECKETT AND I'LL GET THE PROUST DONE AND HOPEFULLY ONE OR TWO MORE I'M NOT HOLDING OUT MUCH HOPE FOR FINISHING THE ENNEADS BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR THOUGH

CURRENTLY AT I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THAT THE LAST YEARS I'VE BEEN AVERAGING ABOUT A YEAR AND I THINK I'LL FINISH THIS YEAR AT ABOUT
I MADE A REAL EFFORT TO SPEND MORE TIME READING AND LESS TIME ON TECHNOLOGY THIS YEAR AS WELL AS READING QUITE LONG BOOKS DARK TOWERS SERIES LOAR CENTURY TRILOGY INSTEAD OF ALWAYS PICKING SMALLER ONES

DEFINITELY A GREAT READING YEAR FOR ME
I SET MY CHALLENGE TO BUT HAVE ENDED UP SURPASSING THAT I'M CURRENTLY AT I PLAN TO READ AT LEAST BOOKS BY THE END OF THE YEAR

I'VE BEEN SICK WITH VARIOUS THINGS THIS YEAR AND UNEMPLOYED FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR JUST TO EXPLAIN MY NUMBER A BIT I'M UP TO MY ORIGINAL GOAL WAS WHICH I'VE OBVIOUSLY SURPASSED
I'D ORIGINALLY SET MINE FOR BUT AN HONOURS DEGREE KIND OF GOT IN THE WAY SO I ROUNDED IT DOWN TO A NICE SOLID I'M ON MY WAY TO COMPLETING IT NOW HERE'S WHAT I'M HOPING TO GET TO BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR

THE CIRCLE BY DAVE EGGERS CURRENTLY READING PROMISING SO FAR
GHOST BY VERA BROSGOL

AUTUMN BY ALI SMITH

I ALSO REALLY WANT TO TACKLE THE COLLECTION OF TED WORKS ON MY DREADER BUT I ALSO WANT TO SEE ARRIVAL FIRST
I STARTED THE CHALLENGE A FEW WEEKS AGO AND DECIDED TO COUNT THE WEEKS LEFT IN THE YEAR AND ADD THAT TO THE AMOUNT OF BOOKS I'VE ALREADY READ I AM NOW AT OF SO I THINK I'LL MAKE IT
WAS THE GOAL CURRENTLY ON WHICH I SHOULD FINISH THIS WEEK ANOTHER MONTH FULL OF READING TO GO WITH A LOT MORE TIME OVER THE CHRISTMAS BREAK
I DIDN'T DO THE CHALLENGE BUT MY GOAL WAS BOOKS FINISHED AND HALFWAY THROUGH NUMBER UPROOTED I WILL PROBABLY START THE PAYING GUEST BY SARAH WATERS BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR BUT I DOUBT I'LL FINISH IT

I'M SURE IF I COUNTED COMIC I'LL HAVE MORE BUT I DON'T

I SET MY GOAL OF BOOKS IN JANUARY THEN FORGOT ABOUT IT THEN REMEMBERED IT BY LATE JULY RIGHT NOW I'M AT BUT FOR NEXT YEAR I THINK I'M GONNA GO FOR LESS BUT LONGER BOOKS WAR AND PEACE CRIME AND PUNISHMENT AND THE LIKE I'M AIMING AT BOOKS NEXT YEAR BOOKS PER MONTH
I HIT BOOKS JUST BEFORE I STARTED MY FIRST SEMESTER OF GRADUATE SCHOOL THIS SEPTEMBER NEEDLESS TO SAY I'M STILL AT BOOKS

I'M PLANNING TO READ A FEW DURING MY WINTER BREAK THOUGH
MY ORIGINAL GOAL WAS BUT THEN I STARTED READING GRAPHIC NOVELS SO I BUMPED THE NUMBER UP TO I JUST FINISHED AND I'LL HOPEFULLY HIT BY THE END OF THE YEAR

WONDERING IF I SHOULD STICK TO A BOOK GOAL NEXT YEAR OR BUMP IT UP
I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE I SET MY GOAL TO I READ IN SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT TRY AFTER A REALLY SHITTY YEAR I'M AT NOW AND NOT TOO HAPPY I WILL TRY TO READ A FEW MORE IN THE NEXT MONTH THOUGH

IMPRIMATUR BY MONAULI AND CORTI CURRENTLY READING
2 A TALE OF TWO CITIES BY DICKENS
MIDDLESEX BY J EUGENIDES
CORRECTIONS BY FRANZEN

SET MYSELF A TARGET OF FOR EACH MONTH AND I'M CURRENTLY ON WITH THE HOPE OF ADDING 2 MORE BEFORE
CURRENTLY I'M AT BOOKS READ SINCE I'M A FULL TIME STUDENT I FIGURED I WOULD GET LOADS OF READING DONE OVER THE SUMMER BUT I ENDED UP WORKING FULL TIME AND NEGLECTED READING I'M TRYING TO READ A LITTLE IN THE MORNINGS BEFORE I GO TO CLASS OR WORK BUT IT HASN'T BEEN WORKING OUT TOO WELL LATELY I FINISH SCHOOL DEC SO I'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO CATCH UP ON SOME READING BEFORE THE YEAR IS OVER
SET MINE FOR WHICH I'VE READ SO FAR THOUGH I HAVEN'T LIKED AS MANY OF THE BOOKS MY TOP ARE THE BELL JAR SAY NOTHING TO THE DOG NIGHT FILM FIGHT CLUB AFTER DARK AND TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD

LOOKING TO FINISH THE PLAGUE ONCE A RUNNER THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE DAMNED AND THE SIRENS OF TITAN BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR BUT I NEVER STICK TO LISTS
SET MINE TO AND FAILED HAVE FINISHED SO FAR A MONTH AGO I STOPPED GOING FOR THE CHALLENGE BECAUSE I NOTICED I WASN'T LIKING THE FACT I NEEDED TO READ TO GET TO THE GOAL I WANT TO READ BECAUSE I WANT TO AND NOT TO GET TO A CERTAIN NUMBER

I ALSO NOTICED I WANTED TO READ CERTAIN BOOKS BUT WOULDN'T BECAUSE THEY WOULD TAKE TOO LONG AND I STILL NEED TO READ 2 BOOKS THIS MONTH

SO LAST MONTH I JUST SAID SCREW IT AND STARTED TO READ WHAT I WANTED WHEN I WANTED LAST YEAR I READ BOOKS THIS YEAR I'M FINISHING UP BOOK NR SO THAT'S A WIN IN MY BOOK I GUESS THESE READING CHALLENGES AREN'T FOR ME


IT NEVER DID EVEN WITH THE NY TIMES BEST SELLER LIST IT WAS IS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY BOOKS WERE SOLD BUT HOW MANY WERE SOLD AT WHICH REPORTING STORES ON WHICH DATES


BESTSELLING IS MEANINGLESS TO ME BUT NOT FOR THE REASONS BEING DISCUSSED HERE AS A READER I DON'T CARE MUCH FOR HOW MANY BOOKS A WRITER HAS SOLD THAT TELLS ME LITTLE ABOUT THE BOOK PROBABLY HAS THE BESTSELLING HAMBURGER FEW WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S A GREAT HAMBURGER
DIDN'T CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY MEMBERS BUY UP CASES OF DIANETICS TO KEEP THE SALES NUMBER HIGH
IT'S NEVER REALLY MEANT MUCH TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY BOOK IS A BESTSELLER THESE DAYS IF IT'S NOT ON THE NYU LIST IT'LL USUALLY BE ON SOMETHING ELSE
I HAVE READ ARTICLES ON EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IF I FIND A LINK I'LL POST IT BUT YES THE ACTUAL NUMBERS ARE NOT ALWAYS KNOWN SOME NUMBERS ARE HIDDEN AND DIFFERENT BESTSELLER LISTS COUNT DIFFERENT THINGS IT IS REALLY JUST A MARKETING TOOL NOW
NAH SELLING A LOT OF BOOKS ISN'T NECESSARILY AN INDICATION OF QUALITY
MOST OF THE BOOKS ON THE NYU BESTSELLER LIST ARE TOTAL GARBAGE LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THAT

THE BEST BOOKS I'VE READ RECENTLY WERE NEVER BESTSELLERS AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE IF YOU'RE INTO PHILOSOPHY LOOK UP SEMIOTEXT E THE BOOKS THEY PUBLISH ARE NEVER POPULAR BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS GREAT IN MY EXPERIENCE THOUGH IF YOU WANT A NEAT HISTORICAL TIDBIT THE COMING INSURRECTION A BOOK WRITTEN BY ANARCHISTS ABOUT HOW CIVILIZATION IS COLLAPSING ENDED UP BECOMING A BESTSELLER BECAUSE GLENN BECK USED TO WAVE A COPY AROUND ON HIS SHOW AND CALL IT THE MOST EVIL THING I'VE EVER READ SO THERE'S THAT

YOU WANT REAL GOLD FIND AN INDEPENDENT BOOK STORE WALK TO THE BACK OF IT WHERE NOBODY GOES AND LOOK AROUND IN THERE
HAVE YOU TRIED LOOKING UP THE NUMBER OF BOOKS THAT THEY HAVE SOLD THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE THE MAIN CLUE
IT MEANS DURING THE INITIAL LIFE OF A BOOK IT GETS FREE ADVERTISING IN A WIDELY READ MEDIUM LIKE THE NYU

IT MEANS OVER THE LIFE OF A BOOK ALL SUBSEQUENT PRINTINGS CAN INCLUDE NYU BESTSELLER WHICH IS PERCEIVED BY BOOK BUYERS AS A STRONG ENDORSEMENT BY NYU

IT MEANS OVER THE WRITING LIFE OF AN AUTHOR EVERY BOOK CAN NOW INCLUDE THE BLURB BY NYU BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF WHICH IS PERCEIVED BY BOOK BUYERS AS A STRONG ENDORSEMENT

TL R MAKING BESTSELLER LISTS CAN BE BETTER FOR YOUR WRITING CAREER THAN NOT MAKING THE LISTS
TO ME IT MEANS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS WRITTEN A BESTSELLER
DONT THINK SO IF THEY'RE NOMINATED BY POPULARITY THEN THEY'RE BEST SELLING
IT POINTS THAT WHOEVER WROTE WHATEVER BOOK IS MAKING ENOUGH MONEY TO GET BY THIS YEAR

PRETTY IMPORTANT STUFF IN MY OPINION

STARTED READING THIS BOOK LAST WEEK AFTER HEARING IT WOULD BE A GOOD FOLLOW UP TO INFINITE JEST IT'S NOT INFINITE JEST BUT I STILL FIND IT VERY ENTERTAINING HAVING BURNED THROUGH ALMOST THE WHOLE BOOK THIS PAST WEEKEND
SWEET
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO PICK THAT UP HEARD A LOT OF GREAT REVIEWS FOR IT
ONE OF MY FAVORITES PROFOUND AND HILARIOUS IN EQUAL MEASURE
I MAY THIS ITS NICE THAT WERE NOT DOING A TRENDY BOOK OF THE WEEK BECAUSE OF SOME AUTHOR AMA THIS TIME I READ UNDERWORLD BY DELILLO EARLIER THIS YEAR I DIDN'T ENJOY IT AS MUCH
EXCITED TO PARTICIPATE
JUST TO PROVIDE A COUNTER TO THE GUSHING I SEE I DETESTED THIS BOOK WITH A PASSION NO BOOK I'VE EVER READ HAS ENGENDERED THIS LEVEL OF DISLIKE IN ME IT'S BEEN OVER YEARS SINCE I READ IT THE 2ND TIME WAS HOPING A REREAD WOULD ALLOW ME TO FIND THE VALUE I MISSED THE FIRST TIME AND I HAVE NO INTENTION OF READING IT AGAIN

PLEASE DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM READING IT JUST REMEMBER THAT IF YOU HATE IT YOU AREN'T THE ONLY ONE
COOL THIS IS NEXT ON MY LIST AND THIS WILL FORCE ME TO SPEED UP ON BLEEDING EDGE WHICH I'VE BEEN SLACKING ON SADLY NOT BECAUSE IT ISN'T GREAT IT'S A BARREL OF OCTOPUSES BUT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN JUNKING OUT ON THE WEST WING AND HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC
REMOVED
I ALWAYS FOUND A BIG APPEAL OF DICKENS TO BE HIS DESCRIPTIONS TALE OF TWO CITIES IS ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES TRY READING THE PASSAGE INTRODUCING AND DESCRIBING TELSONS BANK ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES

ALSO IF IT HELPS THAT BOOK IS A GREAT TALE OF DEATH AND LIFE AND THE GLORY OF OR AT LEAST IMPORTANCE OF SACRIFICE
IT'S A STRUGGLE TO READ A LOT OF TIMES IT JUMPS AROUND AND DICKENS WILL GO ON AND ON ABOUT SOME TRIVIAL THING THAT BORES YOU TO DEATH BUT THE END IS WORTH IT HONESTLY THE LAST PART OF THE BOOK IS WHAT MADE IT SO AMAZING FOR ME CHILLS TO THIS DAY JUST THINKING ABOUT IT
IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE READING IT TRY READING IT ALOUD SOME VICTORIAN NOVELS WERE MEANT TO BE READ ALOUD TO PARTICIPIAL PPL WOULD GET TOGETHER AND LISTEN TO READINGS

ALSO REMEMBER ONE KEY POINT THE FIRST PART WILL MAKE SENSE LATER
GO TO THE WILL POWER STORE AND BUY SOME AND TRY READING IT AGAIN ONLY YOU KNOW THIS TIME USE YOUR NEW WILL POWER AND JUST KEEP READING PAST THE FIRST CHAPTER
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD STORY THERE'S A LOVE TRIANGLE YOU JUST NEED TO GET FURTHER INTO IT I SUPPOSE YOU CAN WATCH THE MOVIE FIRST AND THEN READ THE BOOK
I HAD ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TROUBLE SKIP THE FIRST CHAPTER IT'S QUITE A BIT OF VERY FLOWERY WORDING TRYING TO SET THE TONE FOR THE CURRENT SETTING AND POLITICAL ECONOMIC TENSION SKIP IT THINGS HAPPEN AFTERWARDS
TRY WATCHING THE MOVIE VERSION FIRST IN THIS INSTANCE IT COULD BE BENEFICIAL ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS READING OR NOT READING IT
THE LAST CHAPTERS ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING DICKENS WAS A LITTLE OVER DESCRIPTIVE WHEN IT CAME TO LAYING THE SCENE IN THE OPENING CHAPTER BUT IF YOU ARE ABLE CARRY ON READING THROUGH YOU WILL EVENTUALLY REALISE WHY

IN SHORT IT'S A TALE OF LOVE SACRIFICE REVENGE AT A TIME OF REVOLUTION BUT I'M GUESSING YOU KNOW THAT
WHAT WERE YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS GROWING UP ARE THEY STILL YOUR FAVORITES HOW HAVE YOUR READING TASTES CHANGED THROUGH YOUR LIFE
HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT
WHAT IS YOUR WRITING PROCESS LIKE
WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO USE DIFFERENT ALIASES AND HOW DID YOU PICK THE NAMES
HEY MADDIE THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO AN AMA WHEN YOU WRITE FICTION WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR YOUR OWN LIFE SECONDHAND STORIES FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY OR IS IT ALL FROM THE DEPTHS OF YOUR OWN MIND
WHAT ARE YOUR SURE FIRE WAYS TO GET THROUGH A BAD CASE OF WRITERS BLOCK
HI THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTIONS TODAY I'M SIGNING OFF NOW TO GO WRITE A BOOK BUT I'LL CHECK BACK LATER TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY MORE COMMENTS OR REPLIES THANK YOU MADDIE
I'VE WRITTEN A BIT FOR MAGAZINES BUT I'VE DONE IT FOR FREE HOW MUCH EXPERIENCE DO YOU NEED BEFORE YOU CAN MAKE MONEY FOR IT
HI WHO ARE YOU'RE PERSONAL FAVORITE AUTHORS AND WHAT KIND OF BOOKS DO YOU PREFER TO READ
ARE TOU ABLE TO WRITE ANYWHERE OR DO YOU HAVE A WRITING SPACE I USED TO WRITE FREQUENTLY OBVIOUSLY NOTHING AS PROLIFIC AS YOUR WORK BUT SINCE I MOVED TO A NEW CITY AND HOME I CAN'T SEEM TO GET VERY MUCH INTO IT BECAUSE I'M NOT IN A COMFORTABLE PHYSICAL LOCATION WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE FOR MYSELF AND OTHERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE
DO YOU JOURNAL AT ALL IF SO WHAT DO YOU TEND TO WRITE ABOUT

NAME ME A HIDDEN GEM THAT EVERYONE SHOULD READ BUT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS ABOUT
I HAVE BEEN A LITTER SCARED TO JUMP INTO BINARY OPTIONS BEEN FOLLOWING FOR A FEW MONTHS BUT ONCE I GOT ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO GO FOR THE SHOT IT WORKED BKS
I THINK IT COULD BE A FASCINATING STORY
PLEASE WRITE IT NOT ONLY DOES YOUR LIFE REALLY SOUND INTERESTING I THINK YOU CAN ALSO HELP GIRLS IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS LIKE YOURS
GOOD LUCK
PERSONALLY I WOULD I WOULD SAY YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT OUR SUBREDDITS FROM OUR SIDEBAR HOPEFULLY THEY CAN BE HELPFUL AS YOU DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO WRITE YOUR BOOK AND IF YOU DO AS YOU BEGIN TO WRITE IT HIT STUMBLING POINTS NEED FEEDBACK AND EVEN EVENTUALLY PUBLISH

BEST OF LUCK
I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD REALLY LIKE A BOOK LIKE THAT MAYBE EVEN TWO ACTUALLY WHEN DOES THE BOOK COME OUT

ANY PALESTRIAN EGYPTIAN AUTHORS YOU LOOK UP TO AUTHORS YOU LOOK TO FOR INSPIRATION YOUR STORY HAS GREAT POTENTIAL
I THINK IS GREAT I SHARED SOME OF THE SAME VALUES TO AN EXTENT I DO BELIEVE THERE'S A GOD JUST NOT THE ONE PORTRAIT IN MAJOR RELIGIONS I HOPE WE ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE WORK YOU'RE PLANNING ON DOING VERY SOON
I THINK THIS WOULD BE A FASCINATING BOOK PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU LET US KNOW WHEN WE CAN READ IT
GIVE IT A TRY
I GOT THROUGH THE FIRST ONE ALRIGHT LISTENED TO IT ON AUDIO AND I WAS A BIT CONFUSED FOR A WHILE WAS IT CONFUSING READING IT IF YOU HAD IT TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN WOULD YOU CONTINUE PAST THE FIRST BOOK
I LIKED THEM ALL QUITE A BIT BUT THE FIRST WAS THE MOST INTERESTING FOR ME IT HAD A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE AND IT HAD YOU PIECE THINGS TOGETHER THAT AS A WHOLE WERE ACTUALLY INTERESTING IT KIND OF IS A STRANGE EXPERIENCE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS ACTUALLY THE PERSON WITH THE PERSPECTIVE AND WHO IS ACTUALLY A MALE CHARACTER WHICH DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER IF YOU IGNORE IT THE OTHER BOOKS WERE NOT AS GREAT BUT AS FAR AS NEW SCI-FI SERIES GO IT'S ONE OF THE BEST
PERSONALLY I LIKED THE 2ND BOOK BEST THE INTERACTION OF THE SHIP WITH NO ANCILLARY AND THE ANCILLARY WITHOUT A SHIP WAS WELL DEVELOPED IN MY OPINION I THOUGHT 2 HAD THE MOST CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
WHILST I AGREE THAT SEX SHOULDN'T BE RELEVANT WHEN COMPOSING A LIST OF BOOKS A TITLE LIKE THE ONE FOR THIS ARTICLE PAIRED UP WITH THE CONTENT IS A TAD

I CAN UNDERSTAND THE RAGE BUT THE AUTHOR COULD AT LEAST ACTUALLY MAKE A LIST YOU KNOW

I DON'T KNOW JACK KEROUAC AND I HAVEN'T READ LOLITA YET TO TALK ABOUT THEIR SUPPOSED PROBLEMS BUT I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THE CRITIQUE ON HEMINGWAY HIS PORTRAYAL OF A MAN IN CONFLICT THE ONE I READ IN FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS WAS QUITE INTERESTING THE DESIRE TO START A LIFE WITH THE LOVED ONE WAS PUT IN BALANCE DAILY WITH THE RISK OF GETTING KILLED IN A MILITARY RAID OF THE FASCIST SPANISH FACTION WHILE I THINK THE DESCRIPTION WAS ROMANTICIZED I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS GARBAGE NOT AT ALL
THE LIST IS A REMINDER THAT THE MAGAZINE IS FOR MEN AND THAT IF MANY YOUNG PEOPLE NOW DISAVOW THE BINARIES OF GENDER THEY ARE REVOLTING AGAINST MUCH MORE ESTABLISHED PEOPLE BUILDING UP GENDER LIKE AN IRON CURTAIN ACROSS HUMANITY

ARE PEOPLE DISAVOWING THE BINARIES OF GENDER I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL PRETTY DOWN WITH THEM BUT IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE THEN THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO FOCUS ON THE BINARIES OF GENDER SO WHAT WAS SHE EVEN TRYING TO SAY HILARIOUSLY HYPOCRITICAL AND POINTLESS
INTERESTING TAKE ON THAT LIST THAT MEN SHOULD READ HOWEVER I THINK READING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE OFFENSIVE OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM YOUR VIEW COULD BE INTERESTING AND LEADS TO GROWTH POTENTIAL EVEN IF YOU READ IT AND CLOSE IT AND SAY YUP CRAP JUST LIKE I THOUGHT AT LEAST IT WAS TRIED INSTEAD OF JUST TAKING SOMEONE WORD FOR IT
R BOOKS COMMENTS
I UNDERSTAND THE BOOKS FOR MEN WOMEN LISTS THOUGH THEY ARE POINTLESS IF YOU DON'T EXCLUDE THE BOOKS THAT ARE EQUALLY LIKELY TO APPEAL TO EITHER GENDER IF YOU DON'T IT JUST BECOMES A LIST OF N BOOKS EVERYONE SHOULD READ FOR ANY REASONABLE N BUT THIS IS SLIGHTLY CONFUSING THERE ARE PLENTY OF BOOKS THAT AREN'T WORTH READING AND BOOKS ONE GENDER IS LESS LIKELY TO ENJOY THAN ANOTHER BUT I GUESS THE IDEA OF A LIST OF BOOKS ONE SHOULDN'T READ IS A BIT SILLY TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN DIVIDED ALONG GENDER LINES
MY TAKEAWAY IS BOOKS SHOULD NOT BE THIS
IN OTHER WORDS BOOKS ARE INSTRUCTIONS YOU READ THEM TO BE A MAN AND THAT S WHY MEN NEED THEIR OWN LIST

AND SHOULD BE THIS INSTEAD
THESE BOOKS ARE IF THEY ARE INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL INSTRUCTIONS IN EXTENDING OUR IDENTITIES OUT INTO THE WORLD HUMAN AND NONHUMAN IN IMAGINATION AS A GREAT ACT OF EMPATHY THAT LIFTS YOU OUT OF YOURSELF NOT LOCKS YOU DOWN INTO YOUR GENDER
OR MAYBE INSTEAD OF INGESTING CHICK FLICK NOVELLAS PROMOTED BY LISTICLES YOU COULD TAKE A CRACK AT ANY OF THE HUNDREDS OF WORKS OF LITERATURE REFERENCED DURING THE SERIES
IF I GILMORE GIRLS THE NEXT THING IM READING IS THE NECRONOMICON
IT IS PROBABLY PRETTY CLOSE TO THIS LIST
THEY FORGOT TO MENTION A SUICIDE PREVENTION PAMPHLET I KNOW I'D NEED ONE AFTER WATCHING THAT GARBAGE
I BELIEVE HER SON HELPED WITH AUTHORING THIS HE IS QUITE PROLIFIC ON FACEBOOK AND AN ALL AROUND NICE GUY
THE DIFFICULTY ALL HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU'RE WRITING A STORY COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER SAYS BISSELL YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE AWARENESS OF WHAT THE GAMEPLAY LEADING UP TO IT AND COMING OUT OF IT IS GOING TO BE THERE AREN'T EVEN LEVELS YET YOU'RE WRITING SCENES THAT ARE PLANTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS COMPLETELY UNKNOWN ETHER

YOU WRITE OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE YOU'RE DEVELOPING OUT OF ORDER ADDS FERGUSSON YOU DON'T WANT TO START WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME BECAUSE THE FIRST THINGS YOU CREATE WILL NOT BE AS GOOD AS THE LAST THINGS YOU CREATE SO YOU TEND TO GO TO THE MIDDLE AND YOU TEND TO START WITH THE MIDDLE AND WORK YOUR WAY OUT

THAT EXPLAINS A LOT MOST JOURNALISM AND A LOT OF FICTIONAL STORIES BEGIN WITH A STRONG OPENER OR INTRO CHAPTER BEFORE JUMPING INTO THE MEAT OF THE STORY IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MODERN DEVELOPERS ARE JUST THROWING WHATEVER THEY CAN AT A WALL AND SEEING WHAT STICKS

THE ARTICLE EVEN HIGHLIGHTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MODERN TITLE LIKE GOW AND DEUS EX THE LATTER ACKNOWLEDGES VIRTUALLY EVERY ALTERNATE SOLUTION TO ANY SITUATION DID YOU SKIP A SIDEQUEST CHAIN CHARACTERS POINT IT OUT FOUND AN UNINTENDED SHORTCUT YOU FIND SOMETHING SPECIAL OR GET EXTRA INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORLD KILLED A MAJOR CHARACTER BEFORE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO OTHER IPCS WILL POINT OUT HOW YOU ARE WHEN YOU MEET THEM LATER ON
READING IS A PLEASING ACTIVITY THAT ALSO SERVES TO IMPROVE ONE'S THINKING THERE REALLY ISN'T A DOWNSIDE

I THINK READING IN ITSELF IS A CHALLENGE TO YOUR PRECONCEPTIONS AND VALUES SINCE YOU ARE CONSTANTLY EXPOSING YOURSELF TO NEW IDEAS AND DIFFERENT VIEWS
I DON'T THINK SO IT DOESN'T FEEL SELF-CONGRATULATORY TO ME IT MIGHT DEPEND OF THE REASONS FOR READING THOUGH IF YOU JUST PICK THE BIGGEST AND THE DENSEST SO YOU CAN BRAG ABOUT IT LATER MAYBE

BUT IF YOU'RE READING BECAUSE YOU WANT THE KNOWLEDGE OR THE EXPERIENCE OR THE ENJOYMENT IT'S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER PASTIME
I THINK THAT READING A LOT CAN CERTAINLY BE PLACED IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS BINGE WATCHING SOMETHING BUT THERE'S NOTHING INHERENTLY WRONG WITH THAT I ALSO DON'T KNOW THAT I AGREE THAT GAINING KNOWLEDGE FOR THE SAKE OF IT IS HOLLOW ANY KNOWLEDGE GAINED NO MATTER THE MOTIVATION IS INTELLECTUAL GROWTH ONE MAY NOT HAVE AN IMMEDIATE USE FOR THE INFORMATION GAINED BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT WON'T BE USEFUL IN THE FUTURE I ALSO FEEL THAT MORE INFORMATION REGARDLESS OF SOURCE CAN HELP ONE DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE VIEWS OF OTHERS THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY CONSCIOUSLY
I BELIEVE THAT SAYING THAT GAINING KNOWLEDGE THAT IS HOLLOW IS SELF-CONGRATULATORY IS THE SAME AS SAYING THAT EARNING MONEY YOU DON'T NEED TO SURVIVE IS SELF CONGRATULATORY JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED IT NOW DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT ISN'T GOOD TO HAVE IN THE BANK
GRANTED THERE ARE SOME WHO READ A LOT SIMPLY TO FEEL SUPERIOR TO OTHERS AND THAT IS WHERE I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU HOWEVER ASKING THIS QUESTION WOULD SEEM TO EXCLUDE ONE FROM THAT GROUP
ALSO THAT TOPIC TITLE MAY BE ONE THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING THOUGHT HOWEVER EVEN IF IT IS INTELLECTUAL MASTURBATION WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT IT FEELS GOOD AND DOESN'T HURT ANYONE
WELL THEN READ THINGS THAT CHALLENGE WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW IF YOUR CONCERN REALLY IS THE HOLLOW SELF-CONGRATULATORY PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE WHAT BTW I TOTALLY FAIL TO SEE HOW NOT TRYING TO GAIN GREATER PERSPECTIVE INFORMATION AND PERSONAL GROWTH IS GOING TO HELP IN ANYWAY
MOSTLY WHEN I READ ANY KNOWLEDGE OR PLEASURE IS IMPLICIT AND HARD TO ARTICULATE SO I HAVE NO QUALMS WITH EXCESSIVE READING BUT I UNDERSTAND HOW OTHERS MIGHT
IS EXERCISING A LOT MASTURBATING OR SELF-CONGRATULATORY
READ CAMUS THE FALL AND COME BACK TO TELL US HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE AND SELF-ACCUSING WHILE DOING MOSTLY HARMLESS GOOD THINGS

BONUS IF YOU READ THE STRANGER AS WELL AND TELL US IF YOU THINK CLARENCE IS REALLY AN IMPROVEMENT OR LIVED A BETTER LIFE THAN MEURSAULT

I'M NOT BEING NARKY WESTERN THINKERS HAVE A TRADITION OF EMPHASIZING RATIONAL THINKING AND ENDLESS EXAMINATION I THINK THEREFORE I AM BUT AM I A BRAIN IN A JAR

IF YOU ENJOY READING THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT I LIVE LIFE I ENJOY PLEASURE I SEEK AND ENABLE SOLIDARITY THEREFORE I AM THE PASSIONATE FULFILLMENT SEEKING SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE DESERVES RECOGNITION TOO
I'VE ALWAYS VIEWED READING AS MORE AKIN TO GOING TO THE GYM
WELL YOU CAN DO IT BY YOURSELF OR HAVE SOMEONE ELSE DO IT FOR YOU YOU CAN DO IT ONE HANDED IT'S FUN IT RELIEVES STRESS YOU CAN DO IT NEARLY ANYWHERE YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT WHILE DRIVING MATERIALS USED TO BE MOSTLY PAPER BASED BUT HAVE MOVED TO DIGITAL CONTENTION YEP READING IS A LOT LIKE MASTURBATION
NO IT'S MORE LIKE THERAPY OR MEDITATION IT'S A SOLITARY ACTIVITY NOW TALKING ABOUT READING IS ANOTHER THING
HAHA OBVIOUSLY THEY'VE NEVER READ THE FREE KINDLE BOOKS ON AMAZON
GOT REMINDED OF THAT FEELING I HAD AS A TEENAGER WHEN I WOULD BE WATCHING A MOVIE WITH MY PARENTS AND THEN A SEX SCENE WOULD HAPPEN THIS EMBARRASSED CURIOUS ENTERTAINED MIX
THE ONE FROM TOM CONNELLY IS PRETTY FUNNY
THESE REALLY DON'T STRIKE ME AS VERY BAD SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IS A LITTLE COARSE BUT I LIKED SOME OF THE IMAGERY
I READ FEW BOOKS THAT CONTAIN SEX SCENES SO I DON'T KNOW GOOD ONES TO COMPARES THESE TO EXAMPLES
NO MENTION OF SHADES FOR SHAME

A POSY OF SEX SCENES SOUNDS GOOD

I HAVEN'T READ ENDYMION BUT ISN'T THE SEX THAT ASSAD HAS ON THE STAR TREK HOLODECK ON STEROIDS IN HYPERION JUST MIDDLE-AGED WISHFUL THINKING IS AGE WHEN HE WROTE IT REALLY MIDDLE-AGED

CHARLES BUKOWSKI
I THINK THESE CRITICISMS ARE PRETTY VALID

THAT ISN T WRITING IT S TYPING

THIS ALSO SHOWS HOW OTHER WRITERS TEND TO BE PRETTY JEALOUS OF EACH OTHER THESE MORE TRADITIONAL WRITERS SAW HIM AS A HACK AND THEY HATED HE GOT FAMOUS FROM IT
WHAT DO THINK OF HIM I'VE READ OF HIS BOOKS AND CONSIDER HIM MY FAVORITE AUTHOR
A FEW OF THOSE WRITERS SEEM LIKE PEOPLE WHO DISLIKE PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE
I HAVE NEVER READ JACK KEROUAC I NEED TO GIVE IT A TRY
EVEN SO THERE'S A NORMAN TEXT WHERE HE SAYS A BUNCH OF INTELLIGENT THINGS ABOUT THE BEATS I DIDN'T FIND IT ONLINE BUT YOU CAN READ IT ON THE PENGUIN'S PORTABLE BEAT READER
MUCH OBLIGED
THE BEAT WRITERS SHIT
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD DECIDE WHAT IS OFFENSIVE AND WHAT IS NOT BY LET'S SAY EITHER BUYING THE BOOK OR NOT WHY IS THAT SUCH A HARD THING TO DO I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE LAND OF THE FREE
IT'S KIND OF UNCLEAR FROM THE ARTICLE WHETHER IT WAS THE AUTHOR WHO RECALLED THE BOOK OR THE PUBLISHER IF IT WAS THE AUTHOR WELL HER BOOK HER CHOICE IF IT WAS THE PUBLISHER HM

THEY LITERALLY DISTRIBUTED SOME COPIES OF THE BOOK BEFORE SUDDENLY DECIDING TO RECALL IT THEY ACCEPTED TO PUBLISH IT PRINTED IT HAD IT REVIEWED THE LAST THING ANY COMPANY WANTS IS THEIR NAME ASSOCIATED WITH A PRODUCT MOST PEOPLE AGREE IS UTTERLY TERRIBLE DOESN'T STAND SINCE ONLY PEOPLE REVIEWING IT BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED HAD THE CHANCE TO COMMENT ON IT SO SOMEONE MUST HAVE GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE THE BOOK WASN'T DISTRIBUTED AND THAT DOES SOUND LIKE CENSORSHIP TO ME

IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE PEOPLE READING THE BOOK WHETHER IT'S OFFENSIVE OR YOU KNOW UTTER CRAP OR NOT AND EVEN OFFENSIVE CRAPPY BOOKS SHOULDN'T BE CENSORED IN MY OPINION IT'S NOT THE CONTENT OF A BOOK THAT'S THE PROBLEM IT'S WHETHER THE PEOPLE READING IT ARE CAPABLE OF CRITICAL THINKING OR NOT
WHERE DID JUSTINA IRELAND LEARN THE CRAFT OF WRITING

CANDLEWICK S DECISION TO PULL THE BOOK CAME IN THE FORM OF A TERSE EMAIL THE AUTHOR WAS PULLING THE BOOK TO WORK ON IT FURTHER SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL TRIED TO DIG DEEPER BUT ACCORDING TO THE PUBLISHER THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO SAY THE AUTHOR EE HAD DECIDED TO PULL THE BOOK THE END

SO IT WAS THE PUBLISHER WHO DECIDED TO PULL THE BOOK AFTER THE AUTHOR DECIDED TO PULL THE BOOK

AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE BOOK IN QUESTION

THAT LAST THING ANY COMPANY WANTS IS THEIR NAME ASSOCIATED WITH A PRODUCT MOST PEOPLE AGREE IS UTTERLY TERRIBLE THAT IS NOT A SMART FINANCIAL MOVE

SOUNDS LEGIT EXCEPT

REVIEW MAGAZINES HAD GIVEN THE BOOK STARS

AND

FROM YOUR STARRED REVIEWS FOR YOUR AUTHENTIC BLACK VOICE BY OSTENSIBLY WHITE REVIEWERS


FUCK ME I HOPE SHE DIDN'T GET PAID REAL MONEY TO WRITE THIS
THE BLDR OF THE SITUATION WHEN WE WAS FIERCE BY EAST EAST HAS BEEN CANCELLED SHORTLY BEFORE PUBLICATION IT WAS LITERALLY YANKED OFF THE SHELVES OF LIBRARIES THAT HAD ALREADY RECEIVED FINISHED COPIES


I VE BEEN STUNNED AT HOW LITTLE MEDIA ATTENTION THIS SITUATION IS RECEIVING A BOOK WAS TAKEN OFF SHELVES BECAUSE ITS CONTENT WAS DEEMED TOO OFFENSIVE THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF CENSORSHIP BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MY FELLOW READERS AREN T EVEN AWARE THIS HAPPENED SO I FELT THE NEED TO SUBMIT THIS LINK AND SPREAD AWARENESS

THE PUSH TO CENSOR THE NOVEL WAS LED BY JUSTINA IRELAND AUTHOR OF THE ABOVE ARTICLE AND ALSO OF YA NOVELS THAT COMPETE WITH AND A GROUP OF HER EXTREMIST FOLLOWERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA HERE ARE SOME MORE LINKS ABOUT THE CENSORING IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE


FROM SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL THIS ARTICLE WAS ORIGINALLY TAGGED WITH THE KEYWORD CENSORSHIP ON THE LJ BLOG FOLLOWING AN OFFENDED OUTCRY FROM READERS THIS TAG WAS REMOVED AND LJ HAS ISSUED AN APOLOGY


A STATEMENT FROM EAST EAST EXPLAINING HER REASONS FOR WRITING THE BOOK


AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE CANCELLATION BY THE BLOG READING WHILE WHITE


ALSO I REALIZE THIS IS A TOUCHY SUBJECT BUT PLEASE PLEASE KEEP THE COMMENTS IN THIS THREAD CIVIL AND BASED ON LOGIC NOT OUTRAGE I D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF CENSORSHIP PLEASE DON T LET THINGS GET SO HEATED NASTY THAT MODS START DELETING COMMENTS



SO OFFENDED BY THE LANGUAGE IN THE BOOK THAT IRELAND USES THE WORD TO CRITIQUE IT GREAT STRIDES GREAT STRIDES
MORE IDENTITY POLITICS JUST WHAT THE WORLD NEEDED
OFFENSE IS SUBJECTIVE

IT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENT IS CENSORSHIP BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE TO HOST YOUR VIEWS ARE YOU REALLY SO ENTITLED YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED TO PUBLISH YOUR WORKS
DO THEY HAVE A UNIQUE COVER OR DO THEY HAVE THE STANDARD COVER WE'RE ALL USED TO
I THINK THAT FINAL LINE WAS PROBABLY MEANT PRETTY IRONICALLY AFTER ALL GERMANS AT THE TIME WERE IN DENIAL ABOUT SOME OF THE DARKER ACTIVITIES GOING ON AROUND THEM AND PROBABLY SAID THINGS LIKE THAT COULDN'T HAPPEN NOT IN THIS DAY AND AGE

SIDESTEPPING YOUR THORNIER POINTS ABOUT IT'S PROBABLY GENGHIS KHAN I'M VERY GLAD THAT THIS NOVEL HAD SUCH AN IMPACT ON YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER I HOPE THAT YOU AND SHE CAN SHARE PLENTY OF DEEP FASCINATING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AND OTHER ISSUES EXPLORED THROUGH LITERATURE

EDIT CREDIT TO U WECANREADIT I HAD SAID SARCASTICALLY BUT IRONICALLY IS MUCH MUCH BETTER
IT'S IRONY BY THE TIME YOU'VE REACHED THE LAST SENTENCE YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR PRETTY WELL AND YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES AUTHORS WRITE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY MEAN FOR SATIRICAL EFFECT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS WITH SUCH A BIG PINCH OF SALT THERE WON'T BE ANY SALT LEFT
OF COURSE ALL THIS HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO AND NOTHING LIKE THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN AGAIN NOT IN THIS DAY AND AGE THIS SENTENCE UTTERLY DISTURBS ME

I'M PRETTY THOROUGHLY CERTAIN THAT'S THE POINT IT'S MEANT AS ABSOLUTE HYPERBOLE WITH A DASH OF SARCASM TO IMPLY EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS SAID THE ENTIRE BOOK HAS GRUELINGLY PLAYED OUT A STORY THE WHOLE THING IS MEANT TO BE PERSONALIZED AS CAUTIONARY
SEEMS LIKE IT'S SATIRICAL SARCASTIC ALSO ISN'T IT A YA OR YOUNGER BOOK MAYBE THE AUTHOR WAS TRYING TO BE SUNNY AND NOT HAVE ALL THESE CYNICAL TEENAGE READERS
PLEASE TRY TO NOT GET POLITICAL IN HERE MY F

SO LONG A LETTER BY CARIAMA BA

DHAMMAPADA BUDDHIST TEXT
REALLY SURPRISED THERE ARE NO JAPANESE AUTHORS HERE ALWAYS THOUGHT THE MASTER OF GO BY YASUNARI KAWABATA WAS A PRETTY EASY READ AND VERY EVOCATIVE OF JAPANESE CULTURE
I FEEL EMBARRASSED BECAUSE I INITIALLY MISINTERPRETED WESTERN TO MEAN COWBOYS AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY ODD DISTINCTION TO MAKE TALKING ABOUT ALL THE GREAT BOOKS PEOPLE SHOULD READ THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FRONTIERS OF THE OLD WESTERN
WELL I'LL SUGGEST SOME LATIN AMERICAN BOOKS

PEDRO PARAMO BY JUAN RUFFO

AURA BY CARLOS FUENTES

JORGE LUIS BORGES SHORT STORIES ARE AMAZING
I'M BAD AT REMEMBERING STUFF I'VE READ BUT THESE AUTHORS ARE GREAT
THE MASTER AND MARGARITA BY MIKHAIL BULGAKOV IS SUPERB
IN AN ANTIQUE LAND AND CALCUTTA CHROMOSOME BY AMITA GHOSH FICTION BASED ON HISTORY WRITTEN SO WELL THAT IT ENCOURAGED ME TO SEEK OUT THE ACTUAL HISTORY BEHIND THE STORIES AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED HOW WELL RESEARCHED THE BOOKS WERE BEFORE THE CREATIVE LICENCE WAS APPLIED

BUDDHIST


I DONT KNOW IF IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED BUT WE BY YEVGENY ZAMYATIN PUBLISHED IN A SOLID BOOK IF YOU ENJOYED
IF BYZANTINE COUNTS AS THEN THE ALEXIA SHOULD DEFINITELY BE IN THERE
HOW IS THE THREE KINGDOMS NOT ON THIS LIST IT HAS HAD EFFECTS ON NEARLY EVERY FAR EASTERN COUNTRY AND IS REQUIRED READING IN THE MAJORITY OF THOSE COUNTRIES MANY WESTERNERS KNOW THE BOOK THROUGH GAMES THE BOOK IS INCREDIBLY ADDICTING ONCE YOU GET PAST THE SHEER NUMBER OF NAMES AND PEOPLE ILIAD LEVEL NAME DROPS A MUST READ FOR JUST ABOUT ANYONE DELVING INTO HISTORICAL FICTION AND CHINESE HISTORY THE BEST PART IS THAT THE CHINESE HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB AND A LOT OF EFFORT INTO TRANSLATING THIS INTO ENGLISH
BLASPHEMOUS THAT THE THREE BODY PROBLEM BY LIU BIXIN IS NOT LISTED HERE
ASIDE FROM MAHFOUZ AND NARAYAN MANY OF THESE PICKS ARE RATHER ABYSMAL I SUPPOSE A LOT OFT HIS CAN COME DOWN TO THE IDEA THAT THEY JUST STATE STUDENTS AND DON'T SPECIFY STUDENTS OF A PARTICULAR TOPIC BUT FOR THE INSTANCE OF ACTUAL LITERATURE MANY OF THESE PICKS ARE NOT BY LEADING CENTURY AUTHORS OR EVEN REMOTELY INDICATIVE OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN LITERATURE FROM OTHER CULTURES

CHRONICLE IN STONE ISMAIL KADAR YES ALBANIA IS GEOGRAPHICALLY IN THE WEST BUT I AS SOMEONE WHOSE PARENTS ARE FROM SAID COUNTRY THINK ALBANIA IS COMPLETELY OR WAS AT THE TIME OF WRITING IN CULTURALLY SEPARATED FROM THE WEST

THE ART OF WAR SUN TAU THIS MIGHT SEEM ANTIQUED AND SLIGHTLY WEIRD BUT I REALLY THINK IT IS FASCINATING ALTHOUGH IF I WERE A FIRST TIMER I WOULD NOT DIVE INTO IT NOT EXPECTING A CHALLENGE

I'VE READ WAITING FOR THE MAHATMA BY R K NARAYAN WHICH IS ALSO SET IN MALGUDI AN EXCELLENT BOOK WHICH ACTUALLY INCLUDES A FICTIONAL PORTRAYAL OF GANDHI HIMSELF I NEED TO FIND TIME TO READ THE OTHER MALGUDI BOOKS
COMMENTING TO READ ALL OF THEM
I'M A PLEB BUT ITS STILL SHOCKING HOW
I AM COMPLETELY IGNORANT OF BOOKS AUTHORS I REALIZED ANY EXAMPLE I COULD THINK OF OF A AUTHOR WAS COLONIAL OR AN EXPATRIATE ADMIRER I KNOW ITS MOST LIKELY ME BUT IS IT ME OR IS IT THEM

EDIT ITS ME
WHY NOT PERSEPOLIS
IF YOU LIKE MYTHOLOGY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND JOURNEY TO THE WEST WU
INTERESTING ARTICLE AS WELL AS THE THE GOOD SUGGESTIONS AND INSIGHTS HERE IN THE COMMENTS BOOKMARKER NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE IT'S ALL TOO EASY SOMETIMES TO FORGET TO LOOK PAST YOUR OWN BORDERS AND CONSIDER ANOTHER PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE WORLD
MALAYSIAN NOVEL SAGA BY ABDUL TABIB MHD HASSAN I'D RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE
SURPRISED I DIDN'T SEE MASNAVI ON THE LIST
OUT OF ALL THE SUTTA PITAKA YOU CHOOSE DHAMMAPADA
I WOULD SUGGEST IN THE WORDS AN ANTHOLOGY OF DISCOURSES FROM THE PALI CANON THERE IS NO DISCOURSE IN THE DHAMMAPADA AND MERE INSPIRATIONAL VERSES FAIL TO SHOW THE TEACHINGS OF DHAMMA THE BUDDHA TAUGHT THE DOCTRINE THROUGH DISCOURSE NOT RECITING VERSE BHIKKU TRANSLATIONS ARE VERY ACCURATE AND APPROACHABLE WITH HIGHLY DETAILED CITATION AND EXPLANATION

REACHING FORWARD IN TIME TO APPROACH THE OTHER EXTREME I'D SUGGEST THE SIMPLE BUT ILLUMINATING READ FROM THE INSIGHTFUL D TENSE SUZUKI ZEN BUDDHISM SELECTED WRITINGS OF D TENSE SUZUKI IF YOU THINK YOU'RE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN MAHAYANA AND FURTHER DOCTRINAL AND AREN'T AFRAID OF HEAVY BOOKS TRY MAHAYANA DOCTRINAL FOUNDATIONS EXPANDED WHICH WILL ALSO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE LOOK INTO ZEN PURE LAND VAJRASANA ETC
THIS LOOKS LIKE AN INTRIGUING LIST GLAD FANON IS RIGHT AT THE TOP HE'S MY GO TO FOR LIKE BASIC POST COLONIAL THOUGHT I HOPE THE BIT ABOUT THE DOCUMENTARY AND THE LITTLE GIRL IS AN EXAGGERATION
I'M ALSO DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT NO MURAKAMI BOOKS ARE LISTED ADDITIONALLY THINGS FALL APART BY CHINUA ACHEBE SHOULD BE ON THE LIST IN MY HUMBLE OPINION
WE'LL I'VE READ ONE OF THOSE FANON THOUGH I'M DECENTLY WELL READ IN C LIT ESPECIALLY AFRICAN AND CARIBBEAN ASIAN LIT REPRESENTS A HUGE GAP IN MY LECTURE
ANYTHING BY MURAKAMI
KOKOMO BY NATSUME SOSEKI
THE POINT IS WHETHER WE COULD FIND GOOD TRANSLATIONS OR NOT
MADAME THE SECRET DOCTRINE
THE NAG HAMMAD
SO IRONIC THAT YOU DON'T READ ANY OF THEM IN THE ORIGINAL SISTER LANGUAGE
THEY FORGOT THE ART OF WAR BY SUN TAU EVERY YOUNG MAN SHOULD READ IT AT LEAST ONCE
WHAT ABOUT MASTER AND MARGARITA

A MIRROR FOR PRINCES KAIKAVUS

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK ITS PHENOMENAL WRITTEN BY A LORD IN THE IR CENTURY CE DURING THE PERIOD OF MUSLIM DOMINANCE IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE PRECURSOR TO MACHIAVELLI THE PRINCE IT IS TRULY A GREAT WORK OF LITERATURE
I'D ADD STATE OF WAR BY NINOTCHKA MOSCA IT'S A BOOK SET DURING A DICTATORSHIP IN MY COUNTRY
I CAN'T RECOMMEND CAO CLASSIC DREAM OF THE RED CHAMBER THE LENGTH AND GIVES A HUGE INSIGHT INTO LATE CHINA FEATURING SURPRISINGLY SENSIBILITIES GREAT ENGLISH TRANSLATION OUT THERE AS WELL

MALAYSIAN NOVEL SAGA BY ABDUL TABIB MHD HASSAN I'D RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE
SO LONG A LETTER IS GOING ON MY CHRISTMAS LIST
I FEEL LIKE THE ART OF WAR COULD GO ON THIS LIST
THE SYMPATHIZER BELONGS ON THERE EVEN IF IT WAS A BOOK WRITTEN IN AMERICA IT IS DEFINITELY NOT A WESTERN BOOK THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS YOU CAN GET WHEN IT COMES TO IDENTITY EXPLORING FICTION
NORWEGIAN WOOD HARUKI MARUKAMI SHOULD BE HERE AS WELL
ALSO FORGOT JACK ELAM CIRC
I LIKE HOW IT'S A SHORT LIST WITH NO PRETENSIONS TOWARD BEING COMPREHENSIVE LEAVES ROOM FOR SO MANY MORE IDEAS AND SO MANY FEWER ARGUMENTS
THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS BY ARUNDHATI ROY SHOULD DEFINITELY BE ON THIS LIST I'VE READ IT MULTIPLE TIMES AND IT STILL HAS ME ENTHRALLED THROUGH EVERY READ
THEY FORGOT DAYS OF SODOM AND STORY OF THE EYE ESSENTIAL
I'M SURPRISED THAT THE TAO AND JOURNEY TO THE WEST ISN'T ON THIS LIST

ALSO ARTHASHAASTRA THE PANCHATANTRA THE HITOPADESHA AND THE JATAKA TALES NEED TO BE ON SUCH A LIST
IF WE'RE GOING TO INCLUDE WORKS OF SPIRITUAL RELEVANCE THERE'S A SLEW OF STUFF THAT NEEDS TO BE ON HERE NOT JUST THE DHAMMAPADA
IF I WERE MAKING A LIST OF WESTERN WORKS EVERY STUDENT SHOULD READ IT WOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS

ILIAD

PARTS OF THE OLD NEW TESTAMENT

AENEID

DIVINE COMEDY

SHAKESPEARE

MOBY DICK

POETRY OF EMILY DICKINSON

ETC

YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT WILL HELP A STUDENT UNDERSTAND THE FOUNDATIONS AND APPRECIATE THE HIGHEST EXPRESSIONS OF WESTERN CULTURE IF I WERE MAKING A LIST FOR THE STUDENT WITH THE SOLE AIM OF EMULATING THIS GUARDIAN LIST IT WOULD PROBABLY LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS

UNCLE CABIN

BELOVED

TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD

THE COLOUR PURPLE

LITTLE WOMEN

THE BOOK OF JOB

APART FROM THAT LAST AND VERY OUT-OF-PLACE SELECTION THE WORKS ON THIS LIST MAY BE TIMELY THEY MAY EXPRESS THINGS WE WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE MODERN WORLD THEY MAY BE RIPE FOR A MARXIST PROFESSOR'S INTENDED COURSE OF STUDY BUT THEY ARE OF A DECIDEDLY LOWER CALIBRE IN TERMS OF LITERARY MERITS THAN WHAT EVERY STUDENT SHOULD READ I CAN'T BE CERTAIN OF THIS HAVING NOT READ ANY BUT THE DHAMMAPADA ON THIS LIST BUT CONSIDERING THAT I'M AN AVID STUDENT OF PHILOSOPHY AND HISTORY AND HAVE NOT EVEN HEARD OF SOME OF THE LESS THE WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE ANALOGY IS NOT APT
ART OF WAR
I STOPPED READING AT A SPACE ON HER SHELF
BOOKS YEAH SURE OF THEM ARE WRITTEN IN A EUROPEAN LANGUAGE

THAT LEAVES OF THEM AMONG THESE TWO WERE WRITTEN BY AUTHORS BORN IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE
THE GUIDE OF A CHINESE MICROWAVE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW HOW TO MAKE YOUR DINNER IN CHINA IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS HANDY BOOK

I MEAN IF SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE AN INTEREST IN BOOKS EAST G THEY JUST SHOULDN'T READ THEM I READ SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES AND NON FICTION FACULTY BOOKS MAINLY ON PHYSICS DUE TO MY PROFESSION EDUCATION AND THAT IS ALL I NEEDED DURING THE LAST OR SO YEARS

NOBODY SHOULD BE FORCED TO READ ABOUT UNINTERESTING STUFF LIKE ROBINSON CRUSOE OR HOWEVER THAT RACIST BASTARD SPELLS HIS NAME I MEAN IT OK IF YOU LIKE READING AND FIND THAT SHIT INTERESTING BUT THERE ARE LOT BETTER ASPECTS TO FOCUS ON IN SCHOOL THAN BOOK REPORTS FUCK I HATE BOOKS
I THINK A KOBO MINI WILL BE JUST WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CHEAP FULL FEATURED DREADER THAT WILL FIT IN YOUR POCKET THE KOBO BOOK STORE IS PRETTY GOOD PLUS YOU CAN EPUB AND DFS FILES
I WOULD GO WITH ONE OF THE SMALLER MINI TABLETS LIKE A SAMSUNG YOU CAN PUT NOOK KINDLE AND OR OVERDRIVE APPS ON AND HAVE BOOKS AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES IT SHOULD AT LEAST FIT IN JACKET POCKET OR SMALL BAG
WHY NOT JUST USE YOUR PHONE

HAVE YOU SEEN THE SOLARIS I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW HOW THE BOOK COMPARES TO THE MOVIE
I ACTUALLY FINISHED SOLARIS LIKE A FEW DAYS AGO AS WELL

REALLY LIKED IT TOO THE ONLY GRIPE IS THAT IT CAN GET A BIT TOO TECHNICAL FOR IT OWN GOOD ABOUT ITS OWN MADE UP SCIENCE BUT OVERALL ITS VERY ENJOYABLE AND HAS A CREEPING DREAD THAT ALWAYS ENCOMPASSES EVERYTHING
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ALL THAT HIDDEN BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THERE ARE NOT LESSONS TO LEARN IN ANY STORY NOT ALL IS WHAT IS SEEMS LOVE SUCKS LOVE IS GRAND CRIME DOESN'T PAY CRIME DOES PAY
HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD WAS PRETTY BAD BUT MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE FANFICTION ELEMENTS THERE WERE VERY FEW STAGE DIRECTIONS AND IT FELT WEIRD READING IT IN PLAY FORM CONSIDERING THE ONLY OTHER PLAYS I'VE READ WERE ANGELS IN AMERICA AND VARIOUS TENNESSEE WILLIAMS PIECES AND OTHER CLASSICS IT FELT WEIRD READING IT AS A PLAY

BUT THE WORST BOOK I HAD TO GIVE UP ON WAS MY OWN WORDS BY RUTH GADER GINSBURG I TRIED AUDIOBOOK FORMAT AND IT WAS A BUNCH OF RECORDED SPEECHES APPLAUSE AND BACKGROUND NOISE AND ALL TIED TOGETHER BY OCCASIONAL BIOGRAPHICAL BITS I DON'T WANT TO HEAR SOME SPEECH BG GAVE AT A GALA EVEN IF IT IS HER OWN WORDS I'M SURE IT'S BETTER IN WRITTEN FORMAT BUT IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A BOOK
HOT PTERODACTYL BOYFRIEND OKAY YEAH THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL BUT SOMETIMES BOOKS WITH ODD TITLES CAN END UP BEING GEMS NOT THIS ONE DAMN CURIOSITY
I LOVE JASON STATHAM AND I LOVE SHARKS I SAW HE'S STARRING IN A BAD-LOOKING MOVIE ABOUT A GIANT SHARK AND IT SOUNDED RIGHT UP MY ALLEY I FIGURED I'D SNAG THE BOOK IT'S BASED ON TO READ ON VACATION

UNFORTUNATELY INSTEAD OF BUYING MEG A NOVEL OF DEEP TERROR I ACCIDENTALLY BOUGHT MEGA A DEEP SEA THRILLER IT WAS SO LAUGHABLY BAD THAT I ALMOST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT IT WASN'T UNTIL I DID SOME RESEARCH BECAUSE I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY WERE MAKING A MOVIE OF THIS TRASH THAT I FOUND OUT I HAD GOTTEN THE WRONG BOOK
THE LOVELY BONES ONE OF ONLY FOUR BOOKS I'VE EVER ABANDONED WITHOUT FINISHING AND THE ONLY BOOK I'VE EVER ABANDONED WHEN I WAS MORE THAN THROUGH
ARMADA BY ERNEST CLINE JUST NO A BIG FAT NUMBER
I GAVE UP ON ROOM BY EMMA DONOGHUE I SUPPOSE ISN'T A BAD BOOK I CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE LIKE IT ESPECIALLY FANS OF CATHY TRAGEDY PORN I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OBJECTIVELY IT'S CREATIVE AND WELL-WRITTEN BUT I ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT STAND IT I COULDN'T HAVE PUSHED THROUGH ANOTHER PAGE OF MELTED SPOON AND HAVING SOME MORE FROM THE YUMMY LEFT EVEN IF THE WINNING LOTTERY NUMBERS AND A CURE FOR CANCER WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE I GET THE FEELING THAT THE GRATING NARRATION WAS THE POINT BUT FOR ME IT WASN'T WORTH IT
THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE HYPE PRAISE ABSOLUTE DRIVEL
I'M GONNA GET SOME FLACK FOR THIS BUT THE MARTIAN TRIED TOO HARD TO BE FUNNY
ANGELS AND DEMONS BY DAN BROWN

REALLY HATED THIS PIECE OF CRAP IT WAS BORING AND REPETITIVE THROUGHOUT AND I FELT LIKE PUTTING IT DOWN SO MANY TIMES DON'T THINK I'LL BE READING MANY BOOKS FROM HIM IN THE FUTURE
CURSED CHILD OME WHAT A TURD THAT WAS
ALSO I ADORE DAVID MITCHELL BUT I HAD TO ABANDON BLACK SWAN GREEN I'VE READ ALL HIS OTHERS AND LOVED THEM DE MOET IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES
ABSOLUTELY THE WORST THING I READ THIS YEAR WAS MARGARET ANGEL CATBIRD CLEARLY ATWOOD IS AT THE POINT WHERE SHE CAN DO WHAT SHE WANTS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE STORY OR THE ARTWORK OR THE RANDOM CAT FACTS THROUGHOUT THAT DID ME IN BUT IT WAS JUST A MISTAKE
BEAUTIFUL DISASTER BY JAMIE MCGUIRE AWFUL WRITING AND ROMANTICIZING CONTROLLING AND ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR I WAS SERIOUSLY FLOORED BY HOW ABUSIVE THE RELATIONSHIP IS AND HOW IT IS PORTRAYED AS ACCEPTABLE AND ROMANTIC
GIRLS BY EMMA CLINE WAS DISAPPOINTING TO ME I HAD ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED WITH THE MANSON MURDERS SO I THOUGHT A FICTIONALIZED ACCOUNT WOULD BE SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE IT WASN'T AWFUL WRITING BUT IT FELT LIKE A YA COMING OF AGE NOVEL WITH SOME SWEARING AND A FEW GRAPHIC SCENES NONE OF THE CHARACTERS HAD ANY DEPTH IN MY OPINION AND THERE WAS TOO MUCH TELLING INSTEAD OF SHOWING
I DIDNT READ A BAD BOOK THIS YEAR BUT I READ A TERRIBLE BOOK LAST YEAR AND IT WAS INFERNO BY DAN BROWN I USED TO BE A FAN OF HIS BOOKS BUT DAMN DID THAT BOOK SUCK
MR HOUR BOOKSTORE

MR P WAS COOL THE BOOKSTORE WAS NEAT BUT DEAR GOD IF THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS A REAL PERSON I'D PUNCH HIM IN THE BALLS SO WHINY AND PRETENTIOUS AND THE ENTIRE THING SOUNDED LIKE THE AUTHOR HAD JUST DISCOVERED GOOGLE AND WAS TRYING TO BROWNNOSE HIS WAY INTO A JOB THERE

EDIT AHH TOTALLY FORGOT IT WAS A GUY FIXED
RAISE THE TITANIC BY CLIVE CUSSER ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE I'D NEVER READ ONE OF HIS BOOKS BEFORE AND HEARD THIS WAS A GOOD ONE I HATE TO THINK WHAT THE OTHERS MUST BE LIKE THIS WAS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE

RUNNER-UP THE GIRLS BY EMMA CLINE STUNNINGLY BAD WRITING MADE IT ALMOST UNREADABLE
THERE ARE SO MANY KINDS OF WORST TALK ABOUT TWO

I FOUND A COPY OF THE DOSADH EXPERIMENT BY FRANK HERBERT IN A USED BOOKSTORE IT'S A MINOR CLASSIC BY A MAJOR AUTHOR IT'S GOTTA BE AT LEAST OKAY RIGHT NUMBER TWO HUNDRED PAGES OF PEOPLE ARGUING ABOUT THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND HERBERT DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SUBJECT SO IT'S ALL JUST THEN AT THE END THEY'VE ACCIDENTALLY MANUFACTURED GOD

AND THEN THERE WAS THE TRAITOR BARU CORMORANT WHICH IS THE BOOK I MOST HATED THIS YEAR HOW EVERYBODY HATES THE ROAD BECAUSE IT'S HORRIBLE AND AWFUL AND INCREDIBLY WELL-WRITTEN YEAH THAT DON'T READ THE TRAITOR BARU CORMORANT YOU'LL HATE IT BUT READ IT IT'S REALLY GOOD BUT DON'T YOU'LL HATE IT
LIKELY A HARLEQUIN NOVEL I PICKED UP ON A WHIM WHILE WAITING IN THE LIBRARY THE INFAMOUS ITALIAN'S SECRET BABY WITH A TITLE LIKE THAT HOW COULD YOU GO WRONG
THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD PROSE WRITTEN AT A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL OF ABILITY A GIMMICKY TITLE AND PLOT TIE IN THAT ARE COVERED I MAYBE PAGES TOTAL CHARACTER LACKING ANY DETAIL PERSONALITY OR PHYSICAL FEATURES AND A PLOT THAT'S ENTIRELY BASED ON ACTION IT'S PSEUDO LITERARY FICTION THAT DESPERATELY WANTS TO BE A THRILLER AND IS WRITTEN LIKE ONE

THE ENTIRE THING IS A POOR TONI MORRISON RIP OFFICIAL WHITEHEAD DESERVES NO ACCLAIM OR AWARDS
THE MAGICIAN MY FRIEND RECOMMENDED IT TO ME AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT I WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING ALONG HARRY POTTER BUT I WAS WAY OFFICIAL I FOUND IT BORING DIDN'T LIKE ANY OF THE CHARACTERS AND WHEN INTERESTING STUFF HAPPENED I DIDN'T REALLY CARED MY FRIEND STILL LOVES THE BOOK I GUESS IT JUST WASN'T A BOOK FOR ME
JOE HILL'S NEW BOOK THE FIREMAN WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE FAN OF THE GUYS WORK I'D SAY IT WAS THE WORST BOOK I ACTUALLY FINISHED THIS YEAR
THE AFTER SERIES BY ANNA TODD IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH BACK AND FORTH COULDN'T FINISH IT
VANTHE BY WILLIAM BECKFORD I GENERALLY LIKE GOTHIC NOVELS AND THE PREMISE SOUNDED INTERESTING BUT OH MY IS THIS AWFUL
THE HANGING TREE BY BEN AARONOVITCH

I USUALLY LOVE HIS STUFF THE RIVERS OF LONDON SERIES IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE SERIES MR PUNCH IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE CHARACTERS I WAS PROBABLY TOO HYPED FOR IT TSH SEEING AS IT KEPT BEING DELAYED IT WAS JUST TOO PREDICTABLE AND THE BIG REVEAL TOWARDS THE END JUST FELL FLAT FOR ME AFTER THAT PARTICULAR PLOT POINT BEING BUILT ON FOR SO LONG I WANTED MORE IT S LIKE HE DRAGGED IT OUT FOR SO LONG AND JUST IN THE BIBLE NAHUM IT FELT LIKE ONE OF THOSE BOOKS WHERE IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO GOOD BUT AARONOVITCH JUST COULDN T PULL IT OFF HIMSELF
A LITTLE LIFE BY HANYA YANAGIHARA ONLY BOOK SO FAR THIS YEAR THAT I HAD TO ABANDON I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE IN FOR A TREAT GIVEN ALL OF THE OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE REVIEWS THAT I'D HEARD BUT AFTER GIVING UP ODD PAGES IN GAVE IT EVERY CHANCE TO GET BETTER I GENUINELY CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE REDEEMING QUALITY TO THIS NOVEL RIDICULOUS CHARACTERS RIDICULOUS MANIPULATIVE STORY ARC AWFUL WRITING PAGES TOO LONG

PROBABLY THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ LET ALONE IN
THE HEART GOES LAST BY MARGARET ATWOOD THE FIRST THIRD OF THE NOVEL IS A BRILLIANT TAKE ON DYSTOPIAN SPECULATIVE FICTION THAT MOST OF ALL FEELS INCREDIBLY REAL GIVEN THE SITUATION WE'RE FACING MORE AND MORE WITH PRISONS AND THE ECONOMY

THEN THE BOOK GOES COMPLETELY OFF THE DEEP END FOR THE REMAINING TWO THIRDS AS SHE TRIES TO MAKE IT A ZANY BLACK COMEDY AND IT JUST DOESN'T WORK AT ALL IT WAS FAR TOO QUICK A GEAR CHANGE TO KEEP ME INTERESTED
I SHOULD HAVE FIGURED THIS OUT BEFORE I STARTED READING BUT THE IMMORTAL INSTRUMENTS SERIES SO BAD TEENIE A BAD LOVE TRIANGLE ANGST AND BAD WRITING FINDING OUT THAT CASSANDRA CLAIRE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF PLAGIARIZING MAKES SO MUCH SENSE NOW
I JOINED A BOOK CLUB THIS YEAR AND FOR NOVEMBER WE'RE READING YOU ARE A BADASS HOW TO STOP DOUBTING YOUR GREATNESS AND START LIVING AN AWESOME LIFE IT'S THE FIRST SELF-HELP BOOK I'VE EVER READ AND IT HAS CONVINCED ME THAT THE PEOPLE IN MY BOOK CLUB ARE CRAZY FOR THINKING THIS WAS WORTH READING
I READ A NUMBER OF JAMES BOOKSHOPS AND THEY WERE ALL SO BAD LITTLE BLACK DRESS BY EMILY RAYMOND WAS THE WORST OF THE LOT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HELL THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOME KIND OF WEIRD MARY SUE SEXUAL FANTASY THE DESCRIPTION MADE IT SOUND LIKE A THRILLER BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE A MORE SHADES OF GREY
I'M TRYING TO FINISH MY GOODREADS CHALLENGE FOR THE YEAR AND I BUY BOOKS AT A DISCOUNT THROUGH BOOKBUB AND GOODREADS NOTIFICATIONS THIS HAS LED TO A FEW DISAPPOINTMENTS WHICH I FELT OBLIGATED TO FINISH VERONICA BY MARY GAITSKILL WAS JUST TERRIBLE TRYING WAY TO HARD TO BE ARTISTIC AND SHOCKING AND IT JUST FELL FLAT FOR ME

KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE BY PAULA DALY AND THE GOOD NEIGHBOR BY A J BANNER WERE BOTH TOUTED AS THEY WERE NOT I'M GOING TO START SKIPPING ANY BOOK DESCRIPTION THAT STARTS THAT WAY THEY WERE BOILERPLATE THIS WIFE THINKS SHE HAS THE PERFECT MARRIAGE BUT DOES SHE DUN DUN DUUUUNNNN BITCHES BE TRIPPING

THE ANGEL OF LOSSES BY STEPHANIE FELDMAN ANOTHER ONE THAT TRIED MUCH TOO HARD TO BE ARTISTIC AND MAGICAL I READ IT BACK IN JANUARY SO I CAN'T RECALL WHAT EXACTLY RUBBED ME THE WRONG WAY I JUST RECALL BEING PROFOUNDLY BORED BY THE ENTIRE THING
I FINALLY GOT AROUND TO READING CLARIBEL AND DIDN'T LIKE IT OR ANY OF THE CHARACTERS IN IT AND DESPITE STARTING OUT HOPEFUL TO READ SOMETHING A BIT REFRESHING WELL I CAN'T SAY I ENJOYED ANY PART OF IT
ME BEFORE YOU BY JOJO MOYES THIS BOOK WAS AWFUL THE CHARACTERS WERE DRAB AND BORING AND NOTHING SEEMED TO HAPPEN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BOOK THE SUPPOSED TO BE SAD ENDING WASN'T SAD AT ALL FOR ME BECAUSE I JUST DID NOT CARE
THE BUTTERFLY GARDEN BY DOT HUTCHINSON WASN'T VERY GOOD LIKE CRIMINAL MINDS I CAN APPRECIATE IT AS ENTERTAINING SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE GRATUITY BUT OTHER THAN THAT THE ENDING WAS CLUMSY AND THE CHARACTERS WERE SHALLOW
OH BOY I'M AN ENGLISH MAJOR TAKING TWO LIT CLASSES AT ONCE RIGHT NOW AND I'VE GOT A GOOD ONE

IN MY MUSIC IN FICTION CLASS A CLASS WHICH HAS ACTUALLY INTRODUCED ME TO A COUPLE FAVORITE READS WE READ THE NOVEL AN EQUAL MUSIC BY BIKRAM SETH IF YOU RECOGNIZE THAT NAME IT'S BECAUSE HE WAS PREVIOUSLY THE AUTHOR OF A SUITABLE BOY A VERY CELEBRATED NOVEL DURING ITS RELEASE I HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING BY HIM BEFORE AND ONLY VAGUELY KNEW THE NAME

SO AN EQUAL MUSIC IS ABOUT A PROFESSIONAL CONCERT VIOLINIST WHOSE MAIN CHARACTER TRAITS BOIL DOWN TO AN INTENSE FEELING OF LONGING FOR AN WHO HE WAS WITH A DECADE BEFORE THE NOVEL TAKES PLACE HE'S SOMEWHERE IN HIS THIRTIES WE LEARN THAT HE WAS THE ONE TO BREAK THINGS OFF ABANDONING HER WITHOUT A TRACE AND THEN CONTINUE TO ENDURE HIS CANCEROUS VICTIM COMPLEX FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES HE RECONNECTS WITH THIS WOMAN WHO IS NOW MARRIED AND HAS A KID AND IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TRYING TO GUILT HER FOR MOVING ON WITH HER LIFE THEY HAVE AN AFFAIR AND THEN THE WOMAN REALIZES THAT WHAT SHE'S DOING IS WRONG AND SHE LEAVES THE PROTAGONIST IS DISTRAUGHT COMES TO TERMS WITH IT A ND FINISHES ON A VERY NUMB EMOTIONAL NOTE HE HASN'T LEARNED ANYTHING HE HASN'T EVEN EVER ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT THAT HE'S BEEN A PETULANT FOR ACTING AS THOUGH HIS EX BETRAYED HIM FOR HAVING LIVED TEN YEARS OF LIFE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS INSTEAD OF JUST STARING MOROSELY OUT WINDOWS FOR A DECADE NOTHING OF VALUE IS GAINED SET IT AFLAME
I AM PILGRIM HATED IT FAR TOO LONG FAR TOO PLEASED WITH ITSELF JUST COULDN'T GET INTO IT
READY PLAYER ONE

WHAT A JOKE OF A SCI-FI BOOK IT WAS A NOSTALGIA PORN BOOK FOR THOSE WHO GREW UP IN THE S BUT WRITTEN IN FIRST PERSON AND WITH THE PROSE OF A TEENAGER I MEAN I'LL READ A YOUNG ADULT NOVEL BUT THIS ONE YOUNG CHILD LEVELS OF SIMPLICITY AS A LOVER OF SCI-FI I WAS SO LET DOWN MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER BOOK I'VE EVER READ
I LOATHED TWO BOOKS THIS YEAR A HEARTBREAKING TALE OF STAGGERING GENIUS BY DAVE EGGERS AND ME BEFORE YOU BY JOJO MOYES HOLY HELL I STRUGGLE TO REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I READ A PAIR OF BOOKS SO INSUFFERABLE

GENIUS WAS INTOLERABLY TWEE PONDEROUS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF ITS DIABLO SELF-CONGRATULATORY BULLSHIT NARRATIVE I HATED EVERY SECOND OF PRETENTIOUS I AM PRETENDING TO BE SELF-DEPRECATING WHILST BEING THE MOST OBNOXIOUS IN MODERN LITERATURE GOOD GOD SO CONTRIVED SO DULL I AM SHOCKED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE LOVE THIS BOOK

ME BEFORE YOU FARCICALLY CONTRIVED LIKE READING BAD FANFICTION WRITING ABOUT SUPPOSED YOUNG PEOPLE BY A PERSON I AM CONVINCED HAS NEVER ACTUALLY MET A YOUNG PERSON THIS ONE THREW ME BACK TO THE DAYS OF THE STEPHENIE MEYER HEYDAY IT WAS SO AWFUL
I FINALLY GOT AROUND TO READING CATCHER IN THE RYE IT WAS BEYOND BAD
THIS YEAR I RE READ MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA WHICH I HADN'T READ SINCE I WAS FOURTEEN AND THOUGHT WAS PRETTY GOOD I HAD FORGOTTEN MOST OF IT AND THOUGHT WHY NOT REFRESH MYSELF

FAMOUS FUCKING LAST WORDS
MOBY DICK

FIRST YOU GET LIKE PAGES OF QUEEQUEG BEING COOL AND USING HIS SPEAR AS A FORK AND SHIT THEN IT SUDDENLY TURNS INTO THE WORST THING EVER I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT CENTURY MARINE BIOLOGY AND WHALING PRACTICES NOW AND I WISH I DIDN'T
WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOVE BY RAYMOND CARVER AND ICE BY CHELSEA CAMARON THE FIRST ONE BORED ME TO DEATH AND THE SECOND ONE WAS SO DUMB IT MADE ME ANGRY
NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN I LOVE ME SOME MCCARTHY BUT HE STEERED TOO HEAVILY INTO THE REALM OF THE APOCALYPTIC PROPHESY IN HIS OTHER WORKS VIOLENCE ALWAYS WAS SOMETHING BIGGER THAN JUST VIOLENCE BUT HERE IT SERVES AS A VEHICLE FOR CORMAC TO PROCLAIM THE IMMINENT DEATH OF EVERYTHING IN HINDSIGHT IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE ROAD A NOVEL CAME NEXT AFTER THIS

I'M NOT SAYING EVERYTHING HE WRITES MUST LIVE UP TO BLOOD MERIDIAN ALL THE PRETTY HORSES OR SUBTREE IT'S OKAY TO SOMETIMES DROP THE BALL AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID HERE HOWEVER IT DOESN'T REALLY FILL ME WITH ENTHUSIASM TO READ THE ROAD THE LAST UNREAD MCCARTHY FOR ME
UPROOTED BY NAOMI NOVAK IT STARTS OFF INTERESTING AND THEN TURNS INTO A GIANT MESS
READY PLAYER ONE SO HYPED YET JUST FILLED WITH AWFUL WRITING AND CHARACTERS THINLY VEILED WITH NOSTALGIA
I COULD NOT GET THROUGH PHILIPA NEW NOVEL TWO SISTERS TWO QUEENS MAYBE IT WAS TERRIBLY BORING AND THE WRITING STYLE WAS SIMILAR TO YA NOVELS I FELT DUMBER TRYING TO READ IT VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I THINK WAS MY LAST PG ATTEMPT
GRANTED I HAVEN'T FINISHED THE BOOK YET BUT LONEY BY ANDREW MICHAEL HURLEY IS BY FAR THE LEAST INTERESTING BOOK I'VE READ THIS YEAR THERE'S SOME GOOD WRITING IN THERE BUT AT ABOUT PAGES IN I REALLY FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE PAST THE STAGE OF HINTS ABOUT WHAT THE STORY IS GOING TO BE ABOUT

THE AUTHOR ALSO HAS THIS TALENT FOR COMPLETELY KILLING MOMENTUM AND SUSPENSE BY PUTTING IN THESE SEEMINGLY RANDOM FLASHBACKS AND I KNOW THERE'S MORE TO THEM BUT THEY'RE BORING IT'S JUST NOT HOLDING MY ATTENTION AT ALL
TREE OF SMOKE BY DENIS JOHNSON


THE TYPES OF BOOKS THAT WIN THE PULITZER PRIZE OR NATIONAL BOOK AWARD TEND TO FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES FOR ME BOOKS I ADORE OR 2 BOOKS THAT I RESPECT AS QUALITY WORKS BUT DON'T REALLY ENJOY TREE OF SMOKE INTRODUCED ME TO A THIRD CATEGORY BOOKS THAT HAVE LOTS OF UNUSUAL WORDS AND FLOWERY LANGUAGE BUT DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY JOHNSON SPENDS MORE THAN PAGES SPINNING THE WHEELS NEVER DEVELOPING CHARACTERS OR THEMES INTO ANYTHING MEANINGFUL OR EVEN INTERESTING BUT HIS BOOK AS ALL THE RIGHT TROPES FOR A BOOK TO BE EFFECTIVELY MARKETED AS IMPORTANT TO CONTEMPORARY AMERICA AND THE PUBLISHING WORLD BOUGHT INTO ALL OF IT IF THERE'S A SILVER LINING TO MY EXPERIENCE WITH TREE OF SMOKE IT'S THAT I KNOW NOW THAT I SHOULD NOT CONTINUE READING A BOOK I DON'T LIKE JUST BECAUSE OF ITS ACCLAIM I WON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN
ERTH OF THE NEW SUN I CAN'T SAY I WAS A HUGE HUGE FAN OF THE BOOK OF THE NEW SUN SERIES IN GENERAL BUT THE FIRST FOUR WERE ENJOYABLE ENOUGH THE FIFTH BOOK THOUGH FELT LIKE AN AFTERTHOUGHT WITH ABSOLUTELY NO DIRECTION TO ITS PLOT
FORSAKEN POWER BY KJ COLT THE FIRST TWO BOOKS IN THE SERIES WERE DECENT THE THIRD BOOK BEING THE ONE WHERE EVERYTHING STARTED TO GO DOWNHILL I PURCHASED AND STARTING READING THE FOURTH BOOK JUST TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AND EVERYTHING BECAME SO RIDICULOUS THAT I WAS PHYSICALLY IRRITATED BY IT ALL ONLY BOOK I HAVEN'T FINISHED THIS YEAR
HER BY HARRIETT LANE I THINK SHE FORGOT TO FINISH THE BOOK OR GOT BORED AS I WAS SAID HELL WITH IT
A SEPARATE COUNTRY BY ROBERT HICKS I'M SURE IT IS VERY HISTORICALLY ACCURATE BUT MY GOD IT IS PLODDING OVERLY DETAILED NONSENSE S OF PAGES OF NOTHING HAPPENING THE GUY IS PROBABLY A KNOWLEDGABLE HISTORIAN JUDGING BY WHAT I'VE READ ABOUT HIM BUT HE CAN'T HALF MANGLE A STORY BEYOND COMPREHENSION

UNFRIENDING MY EX BY KIM STOLTZ FUCK IF I KNOW WHAT THE POINT OF THAT BOOK WAS I GET IT SHE'S ADDICTED TO SOCIAL MEDIA WHY AM I SUPPOSED TO CARE

THE COLLECTOR JOHN FOWLES FINALLY FINISHED THIS AND WASN'T IMPRESSED AT ALL IT'S ALL ABOUT CLASS AND THE WRITERS WORRY THAT PEOPLE WERE BEING RAISED UP BEYOND THEIR ABILITY TO COPE BASICALLY IT SEEMS LIKE THE WRITER IS A VERY UPPER MIDDLE CLASS GUY FEELING THE LOWER CLASSES NIPPING AT HIS HEELS AND WANTS TO SAY THEY NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER THEY WOULDN'T BE HAPPIER AT THEIR ORIGINAL LOWLY STATION BECAUSE IF THEY TRY TO ATTAIN ANY SUCCESS THEY WILL DESTROY WHAT THEY PRIZE AS SIGNS OF THEIR SUCCESS I'M PRETTY SURE HE CLAIMED HE WAS TRYING TO SAY THE OPPOSITE BUT IF HE WAS TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE HE WASN'T SUCCESSFUL

LOVE OF BLOOD THE TRUE STORY OF NOTORIOUS SERIAL KILLER JOANNE DENNEHY BY CHRISTOPHER THIS WAS ABSOLUTE DROSS OFFENSIVELY BADLY WRITTEN AND RATHER INSULTING TO THE VICTIMS KEPT WANDERING OFF ON WEIRD TANGENTS AND POORLY RESEARCHED IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MAINLY PULLED TOGETHER FROM PRESS REPORTS AS HE COULDN'T GET ANYONE INVOLVED TO ACTUALLY TALK TO HIM LOOKED INTO THE WRITERS CREDENTIALS CAN'T FIND ANY INFORMATION ON WHY HE THINKS HE'S QUALIFIED TO WRITE ABOUT CRIME OTHER THAN ADVERTISING HIMSELF AS A CRIMINOLOGIST ON TV SINCE THE SOUTH

I'VE READ A LOT OF CRAP THIS YEAR IT SEEMS LUCKILY I'VE READ EVEN MORE STUFF I'VE LOVED
THE ONLY BOOK I'VE GIVEN ONE STAR ON GOODREADS SO FAR THIS YEAR WAS AFTER THE CIRCUS BY PATRICK MODIANO I'M STILL TRYING TO DECIDE IF THERE WAS SIMPLY SOMETHING LOST IN TRANSLATION BECAUSE IT WAS ORIGINALLY IN FRENCH AND REFERENCED A TIME PERIOD IN FRANCE THAT I'M SIMPLY NOT FAMILIAR WITH BUT DIDN'T GO INTO ENOUGH DETAIL TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS GOING ON IT SEEMED LIKE NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED AND WHEN THE NARRATOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN FEELING EMOTIONS HE SEEMED COMPLETELY DETACHED AND DISINTERESTED I DIDN'T SEE THE POINT OF ANY OF IT

I MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ANGRIER AT PRETTY GIRLS BY KARIN SLAUGHTER AND A PARTIAL HISTORY OF LOST CAUSES BY JENNIFER DUBOIS THE FORMER STARTED WITH AN INTERESTING PREMISE BUT QUICKLY TURNED TOTALLY CLICH WOMAN MARRIED A MAN WITH A SECRET LIFE WHICH WAS VERY CRINGEWORTHY AND THE LATTER WAS MORE PROMISING HAD AN AMAZING TITLE AND COULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY FASCINATING POLITICAL INTRIGUE INSTEAD THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS WERE SO ABYSMALLY SELF-ABSORBED THAT I ENDED UP HATING THEM BOTH AND THE PLOT FIZZLED WITHOUT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ANY OF THE INTERESTING OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PREMISE THE LOST POTENTIAL STILL MAKES ME FURIOUS
FOREST GUMP BY WINSTON GROOM WAS PRETTY BAD
GOLD YEAH IT'S A YA BOOK BUT BOY O BOY DOES THE MAIN CHARACTER SUFFER CHOSEN ONE SYNDROME AND THEN HAVE IT RAMPED UP TO INFINITY

THERE WAS LITERALLY NO OBSTACLE OR DANGERS IT WAS JUST A HOBBIT RIP-OFF OF A KID WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ADVENTURING OR MAGIC OR SWORD FIGHTING OR OTHER LANGUAGES AND WITHIN PAGES HE IS A MASTER OF THEM ALL FOR NO REAL REASON WELL ACTUALLY HIS SWORD FIGHTS FOR HIM
THE GIRLS BY EMMA CLINE WAS SO OVERWRITE AND CHAOTIC THAT I GAVE UP ON IT I RARELY GIVE UP ON BOOKS

A CERTAIN AGE REBBECCA RAY FOR SOME REASON THIS BOOK IS CALLED PURE ON GOODREADS LIKE THEY CHANGED THE TITLE LATER OR SOMETHING ANYWAYS ABOUT A YEAR OLD WITH A SHITTY HIPPY FAMILY WHO GETS INVOLVED WITH AN OLD MAN AND STUFF A DISTURBING COMING OF AGE STORY WHAT WAS REALLY DISTURBING WAS HOW BAD IT WAS SO MUCH FILLER SO MANY UNNECESSARY SENTENCES THE BOOK SHOULD HAVE BEEN CUT IN HALF PAGES OF BOREDOM
UH A COUPLE OF THE SHORT STORIES IN THE JUNGLE BOOK I GUESS MOSTLY JUST BORING

YEAH I HAVEN'T REALLY READ MUCH THAT I HAVEN'T ENJOYED OR FOUND FUN ONLY REALLY STARTED PICKING UP MASSIVE READING THE LATTER HALF OF THIS YEAR
THE MEURSAULT INVESTIGATION PLEASE DON'T CLAW MY FACE OFF
MATCHBOX THEATRE I PICKED IT UP BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY AND IT WAS THE MOST BANAL CLICHE TRIVIAL THING I'VE EVER READ
DIARY OF AN OXYGEN THIEF BY ANONYMOUS HOLY CRAP WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE NARRATOR JUMPS AROUND SO MUCH AND NONE OF HIS SIDE STORIES EVEN CONTRIBUTED ANYTHING TO HIS MAIN STORY IT'S BEEN A BESTSELLER AT B N FOR SO LONG I THOUGHT IT HAD TO BE GOOD LESSON LEARNED
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT TIG I'M JUST A PERSON WAS PRETTY UNDERWHELMING BUT I'D HARDLY CALL IT BAD I'VE ONLY READ BOOKS AND IT WAS THE WEAKEST OF THE LOT

BUT WHAT IF WE'RE WRONG WAS KINDA INESSENTIAL TOO
THE SHACK BY WILLIAM PAUL YOUNG I MISSED THE HYPE WAVE THAT CAME WITH THE RELEASE OF THIS SO CALLED LIFE CHANGING BOOK A FEW YEARS AGO AND FINALLY GOT AROUND TO READING IT MY FRIEND TOLD ME IT WAS A MURDER MYSTERY WITH CHRISTIANITY UNDERTONES LIKE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A BAD HALLMARK MOVIE FAN FICTION


I'M ACTUALLY IMPRESSED WITH HOW TRITE BORING AND ONE-DIMENSIONAL THE AUTHOR WROTE THE CHARACTERS OF GOD JESUS AND THE HOLY SPIRIT TO BE AND IT'S HILARIOUS HOW YOUNG BUILDS HIS FOUNDATION OF WORLD ROCKIE REALIZATIONS BY MAKING JESUS A JEW WITH A BIG NOSE AND A DISLIKE OF RELIGION AND GOD A BIG BLACK SOUTHERN MAMA NAMED PAPA SO RADICAL THIS BOOK IS PREACHY GARBAGE WITH NO PLOT OR DIRECTION THE DIALOGUE IS WEIRD AND FORCED THE USE OF SIMILES IS SOPHOMORIC AND THE MAIN CHARACTER MACK IS ONLY INTERESTING BECAUSE HIS DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED A GIANT METEOR WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE INTERESTING ENDING TO THIS LACK OF A STORY I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN TOO MUCH YOUNG SAYS HE NEVER INTENDED TO WRITE A BOOK WHICH IS VERY VERY OBVIOUS AFTER READING WHATEVER THE SHACK IS


I'M GLAD THAT PEOPLE FOUND SOLACE IN THIS BOOK I REALLY AM I BELIEVE IN FORGIVENESS AND LOVE FOR OTHERS BUT THOSE ARE THINGS I ALREADY HAD LEARNED BEFORE READING THIS
THE BURIED GIANT BY KAZUO ISHIGURO
I WOULDN'T CALL IT A BAD BOOK BUT IT DEFINITELY WASN'T GOOD EITHER
I WANTED TO LIKE IT SO MUCH BUT IT JUST WENT NOWHERE AND READING AL CALLING HIS WIFE PRINCESS IN ALMOST LITERALLY EVERY SENTENCE HE SAID TO HER NEARLY DROVE ME NUTS
VILLAGE OF THE FULL MOON CURSE BY DANIEL GRIFFIN IS YOUR STANDARD VAMPIRE VS WEREWOLF STORY SET IN RURAL ALASKA BUT WITH WORSE DIALOGUE AND RIDICULOUS MYTHOLOGY I CHOSE THAT ONE EXPECTING IT TO BE BAD THOUGH IT WAS THE LEAST POPULAR NOVEL IN MY LIBRARY'S OVERDRIVE CATALOG
BULL STREET BY DAVID LENDER

IT WAS PRETTY DULL WITH SHALLOW CHARACTERS I WAS JUST IN A BIG MOOD FOR A FINANCIAL THRILLER AND PICKED IT UP ON A WHIM I THINK I'LL BE STAYING AWAY FROM OTHER LENDER NOVELS IN THE FUTURE
WORLD IS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ SOPHIE IS AN OBNOXIOUS ASSHOLE TO HER MOTHER AND FRIEND JOANNA ALBERTO KNOX IS A DOUCHE TO EVERYONE AT THE END OF THE BOOK OK SO YOU KNOW SOME PHILOSOPHY THAT DOES NOT MAKE YOU SPECIAL SOPHIE IT IS NOT LIKE YOU CURED CANCER SHOULD NOT A PHILOSOPHER HELP THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE INSTEAD OF BEING AN ASSHOLE TO EVERYONE ESPECIALLY HIS MOTHER AND FRIEND THE WRITING WAS POOR AND BLAND I HATE THIS BOOK SO MUCH I REMOVED IT OFF MY SHELF
IN TERMS OF ME ACTUALLY THINKING IT'S BAD ON ANARCHY BY NOAM CHOMSKY WAS PRETTY HORRIBLE DROLL AIMLESS DULL WRITING STYLE JUST MAKES IT A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE TO READ REGARDLESS OF YOUR OPINION ON HIS POLITICS IT'S LIKE WATCHING ONE OF THOSE HISTORY VHS TAPES YOUR TEACHER USED TO WHEEL OUT WITH A HUGE CRT TV IN SCHOOL

IN TERMS OF MY JUST NOT LIKING IT BUT APPRECIATING WHY SOME PEOPLE MIGHT MRS ALLOWAY BY VIRGINIA WOOLF ACTUALLY SEEMED TO DRIVE ME A BIT LOOPY UNRELENTINGLY MISERABLE AND DIFFICULT TO READ AND COMPREHEND IF I'M GOING TO PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING IT HAD BETTER REAP SOME REWARDS ALLOWAY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT DID FOR ME
I DID NOT FINISH I LET YOU GO BECAUSE THE PLOT TWIST WAS JUST TOO MUCH AND MADE ME ANGRY I ALSO THOUGHT THE WOMAN IN CABIN WAS BAD
THE SECOND BOOKS TO THE PASSAGE AND THE LEFT HAND OF GOD MAN I I CAN'T EVENING
SAPIENS A BRIEF HISTORY OF HUMANKIND BY YUVAL NOAH HARARI

I LOVE READING ABOUT THIS TOPIC AND STARTED OFF THE BOOK ON A GOOD NOTE BUT BY THE 2ND CHAPTER I COULD TELL THE AUTHOR WAS A GAY MAN ON THE FAR LEFT SIDE OF POLITICS EDIT OH AND A VEGAN I AM NOT AGAINST EITHER OF THE TWO BUT I JUST FOUND TOO MANY CONNOTATIONS AND INFERENCES IN A BOOK WITH NO RELATION TO EITHER TOPIC THE AUTHOR ALSO USED SOME THEORIES WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN REFUTED AT THE TIME OF WRITING
EXODUS BY LEON URIS

SUFFERED FROM THE AUTHOR'S ATTEMPT TO PUSH HIS ON VIEW POINT OF WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG TOO MANY IMPORTANT MOMENTS HINGED ON ASSUMPTIONS I WASN'T PREPARED TO MAKE SO THE WHOLE BOOK FELL FLAT AND FELT LIKE A MORAL LESSON
BLUES PEOPLE BY LEROI JONES AWFUL CRITICISM AWFUL HISTORY
EASILY SAME KIND OF DIFFERENT AS ME BY DENVER MOORE AND RON HALL BADLY WRITTEN SMARMY AND SELF INDULGENT
GHOSTLAND IT WASN'T THE WORST THING I'VE EVER READ BUT IT HAD SO MUCH PROMISE IT STARTS OFF GREAT AND THEN FALLS INTO THE SAME REPETITIVE THING HERE'S A COOL GHOST STORY HE'S THE REAL STORY HERE'S A LOT OF STUFF YOU MIGHT FIND INTERESTING SOME THEORY BUT PROBABLY COULD SKIP
ATTEMPTED TO LORD BANE BY STEPHEN ROYAL DONALDSON I'D HAPPILY PLOWED THROUGH THE FIRST TWO TRILOGIES IN HIGH SCHOOL

I MUST HAVE HAD A LOT MORE FREE TIME BACK THEN
LOOKING FOR ALASKA
TODAY WILL BE DIFFERENT BY MARIA SEMPLE THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS INCREDIBLY UNLIKABLE AND THE STORY WAS OUTLANDISH
THE SLOW REGARD OF SILENT THINGS JUST COULDN'T BEAR WITH IT TOO ABSTRACT
HONESTLY I REALLY DISLIKED THE CURSED CHILD
THE WIDOW BY FIONA BARTON IT WAS HYPED AS THE ONE OF THE NEXT GONE GIRLS I FELT STUPID AFTER READING IT I ONLY FINISHED IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO ADD ANOTHER BOOK TO MY GOODREADS CHALLENGE THANK GOODNESS IT WAS JUST A LIBRARY BOOK
THERE'S A COUPLE THAT I READ THIS YEAR THAT REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME

RAT QUEENS VOLUME DEMONS I READ THE FIRST TWO VOLUMES RIGHT BEFORE THIS ONE AND I REALLY ENJOYED THEM I FELT LIKE THE THIRD ONE TOOK A COMPLETE NOSEDIVE THE PLOT WAS CONFUSING AND A LOT OF THE CHARACTERS SEEMED SO DIFFERENT THAN HOW THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN

RUIN AND RISING THIS IS THE THIRD BOOK IN THE GEISHA SERIES A YA FANTASY NOVEL THAT CENTERS AROUND A MAGIC GIRL CHOSEN ONE I DON'T READ A LOT OF YA BUT I THOUGHT THE SETTING WOULD BE INTERESTING AND I'D HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY LIKED THE MAIN VILLAIN I LOVE WELL-WRITTEN AND COMPLEX VILLAINS THE FIRST BOOK WAS GOOD THE SECOND ONE WAS OKAY AND I FELT LIKE THE THIRD ONE WAS A HUGE WASTE OF TIME
OUTLINE BY RACHEL CUSK SO MUCH ACCLAIM I COULD BARELY STAY AWAKE AND GET THROUGH IT WHAT AM I MISSING
FOOL ME ONCE BY HARLAN COBEN
I HAD READ ONE OF BOOK STRANGER ABOUT YEARS AGO I DIDN'T REMEMBER THE PLOT BUT I REMEMBER I LIKED IT THEN FOOL ME ONCE WAS DISAPPOINTING WHICH BOOK COULD YOU RECOMMEND IF I EVER READ SOMETHING AS BORING AS FOOL ME ONCE I'M AFRAID I'LL AVOID STUFF
METRO BY DIMITRY GLUKHOVSKY

INITIALLY I WAS EXCITED TO READ THIS BOOK AS THE CONCEPT SEEMED VERY INTERESTING THIS BOOK WAS LESS ABOUT THE METRO AND MORE ABOUT GENERIC CHARACTERS REPEATED CONTINUOUSLY SAYING THE SAME CRAP I FELT IT ENDED SO POORLY AND ABRUPTLY WHEN IT DID I WAS SIMPLY RELIEVED
BY STEPHEN KING HOLY SHIT DID THAT BOOK TAKE A DUMP ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH I COULDN'T FINISH IT
ZEN THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE BORING STORY LINE AND THE WRITER SEEMED COCKY ALMOST

NAKED LUNCH THE LINGO WAS SO TERRIBLE AND CONFUSING I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH THE BOOK

THE GUNSLINGER INCREDIBLY BORING STORY WHERE BASICALLY NOTHING HAPPENS FOR OF THE BOOK THIS BOOK BEING SO BAD WAS CEMENTED IN MY MIND WHEN I READ THE 1ST PAGES OF THE NEXT BOOK IN THE DARK TOWER SERIES AND WAS BLOWN AWAY BY HOW MUCH BETTER THOSE PAGES WERE COMPARED TO THE ENTIRE 1ST BOOK
CROSSTALK BY CONNIE WILLIS


ACTUALLY IT MAY NOT COUNT HERE FOR THIS BECAUSE I QUIT READING IT BEFORE FINISHING IT WAS COMPLETELY MIND NUMBING POORLY WRITTEN HAD ALL SORTS OF INTERNAL INCONSISTENCIES AND WAS GENERALLY AWFUL

IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE READ SOMETHING I HATED SO MUCH
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY TOTAL DUDS THIS YEAR ACTUALLY I THINK THE ONLY ONES I WAS PRETTY MPH ON WERE THE WICKED THE DIVINE AND REVIVAL BOTH GRAPHIC NOVELS BASICALLY EVERYTHING ELSE WAS STARS EVEN WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN READING FOR ME TO HIT MY CHALLENGE GOAL ALBEIT A TOTALLY UNIMPRESSIVE NUMBER I'VE BEEN READING IN THE SINGLE DIGITS THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS
FOR ME IT WAS BRAVE NEW WORLD BY ALDOUS HUXLEY I KNOW I KNOW SORRY AND TINKERS BY PAUL HARDING BOTH OF WHICH HAD ME SCRATCHING MY HEAD THE ENTIRE TIME WITH LITTLE DESIRE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WERE REALLY ABOUT
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BOOKS I REALLY DISLIKED BUT MY LEAST FAVOURITE IS PROBABLY THE GUNSLINGER HOWEVER I AM NOW READING THE DARK TOWER SO EVEN THOUGH THE FIRST ONE WAS NOT SO GOOD I KEPT READING AND I ENJOYED THE REST
I HAVE TWO

I HAVE NO MOUTH AND I MUST SCREAM BY HARLAN ELLISON IT'S A COLLECTION OF SCI-FI FANTASTICAL SHORT STORIES BY THE TITLE STORY IS PHENOMENAL AND DECADES AHEAD OF ITS TIME UNFORTUNATELY EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE BOOK IS JUVENILE CRAP LIKE THE KIND OF STUFF A YEAR OLD WHO LIVES IN HIS BASEMENT WOULD WRITE

LOVE-LIES-BLEEDING BY DON DELILLO IT'S A PLAY AND WHILE DELILLO IS A HUGELY CELEBRATED NOVELIST AS A PLAYWRIGHT HE LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED IT'S JUST CHARACTERS ALONE IN A ROOM TALKING AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT EVER TALKING TO EACH OTHER EVEN WORSE THE WHOLE THING IS REALLY JUST AN ISSUES PIECE ABOUT EUTHANASIA STICK WITH HIS NOVELS THIS WAS JUNK
THIS IS WHERE IT ENDS I ACTUALLY COULDN'T WAIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT BECAUSE I HEARD INTERESTING REVIEWS AND IT HAS A REALLY COOL COVER I KNOW I KNOW THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE I RARELY DON'T FINISH A BOOK BUT THIS THING SUCKED SO BAD IT ACTUALLY MADE ME ANGRY CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED
I STARTED READING FIGHT CLUB AND I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE I ORDERED IT USED FOR A COUPLE BUCKS AND HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO THROW IT IN THE TRASH GREAT MOVIE ABSOLUTELY SHIT NOVEL
YES ANOTHER THREAD PASSES WITH NO MENTION OF ANYTHING I'VE WRITTEN SUCCESS

AHEM ANYWAY

AFTER LOOKING BACK THROUGH MY GOODREADS RATINGS THE LOWEST RATING I GAVE THIS YEAR WAS A SCORE TO THE BOOK DRAGON THIEF I JUST WHERE TO BEGIN

I MEAN I CAN EXCUSE A LITTLE WISH-FULFILLMENT A LITTLE MAIN CHARACTER IS A MASTER THIEF WHO AFTER MONTHS OF SEARCHING HAS FOUND A DRAGON'S LAIR AND IS INTENT ON PILFERING IT INSTEAD THE DRAGON PILFERS HIM AND AFTER LEARNING HE'S A MASTER THIEF DECIDES HE'S A GREAT ADDITION TO HER COLLECTION

AND FROM THERE UGH THE PLOT HAD NO OVERALL GOAL OR AIM MEANDERING AIMLESSLY MAGIC POWERS AND CAPABILITIES ARE HANDED OUT AS NEEDED TO PRODUCE DEUS EX KACHINAS THOUGH TO BE FAIR THEY'RE HARDLY EXPLAINED ANYWAY SO IT'S HARD TO TELL

ALL IN ALL IT WAS A MESS OF A BOOK I'D READ ANOTHER BY THE AUTHOR BEFORE AND FOUND IT DECENT SO I WAS WILLING TO GIVE THIS ONE A CHANCE AND WAS DISAPPOINTED PRETTY HEAVILY
MY SCIENCE TEXTBOOK
SO I'LL PROBABLY GET A LOT OF FLACK FOR THIS BUT SATANIC VERSES WAS TERRIBLE SHOULD I GO BACK AN REREAD IT AM I BEING TOO HARSH
SIDDHARTHA WHAT A MESS OF BOOK I GET LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKE IT BUT I JUST COULDN'T HANDLE IT
FAHRENHEIT

GOD WHAT A SHITTY BOOK IT TRIED SO HARD TO BE IT FAILED MISERABLY THE CHARACTERS WERE AWFUL THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY SUBSTANCE IT NEVER REALLY EXPLAINED HOW THE SOCIETY WORKS AND THE END CAME OUT OF NOWHERE
FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE

JUST NUMBER
I DON'T READ BOOKS BUT THIS YEAR I DECIDED TO CHECK ON SHADES OF GRAY I MUST SAY IT'S FASCINATING TWO PARAGRAPHS IN I GAVE UP THINKING I COULD PUBLISH MY OWN BOOK
IF THIS IS THE WRONG SUBREDDIT COULD SOMEONE PLEASE SEND ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
THANK YOU SO MUCH
HAS ANYONE FIGURED OUT WHAT THIS THING ACTUALLY IS YET
I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE ENDING

IT WASN'T AS HARD HITTING AS IT'S MADE OUT TO BE THOUGH I DON'T THINK AFTER ALL THE HYPE I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY SOUL CRUSHING TO READ AND IT DEFINITELY DIDN'T LIVE UP TO THAT HYPE
I READ THIS BOOK WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER AND AGAIN AS AN ADULT I REALLY LIKED IT
THANK YOU FOR SHARING I'VE NOT READ THIS BOOK YET BUT IT'S BEEN ON MY LIST AND I THINK I'LL MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY BOOK FOR
MARGARET ATWOOD DID AN AMA HERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK HERE'S A LINK TO ALL OF OUR UPCOMING AMAS

I AM A BOT AND THIS ACTION WAS PERFORMED AUTOMATICALLY PLEASE CONTACT THE MODERATORS OF THIS SUBREDDIT MESSAGE COMPOSE TO R BOOKS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS
I HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING IT I READ THE BOOK NOT TOO LONG AGO AND LOVED IT

I THINK OF PART THE CAPTAIN TRIPS SECTION AS SERVING THREE FUNCTIONS DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOOKS MAIN CHARACTERS WEAVING THEIR STORY ARCS TOGETHER AND FLESHING OUT THE CAPTAIN TRIPS SUPERFLUX AND HOW DEVASTATING IT REALLY WAS BY GOING INTO DETAIL ABOUT ITS SPREAD AND DESCRIBING THE MANY DEATHS FROM IT THE STUFF ABOUT CT ITSELF IS VERY ENTERTAINING TO READ ABOUT BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS ANCILLARY TO THE FIRST TWO FUNCTIONS OF PART SK COULD HAVE STARTED THE BOOK BY SAYING A SUPERFLUX WIPED OUT OF THE POPULATION THESE ARE THE SURVIVORS AND GO FROM THERE AND THE ACTUAL PLOT OF THE STORY WOULD REMAIN LARGELY INTACT NO I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS I THINK THE STORY THAT HE TOLD WAS DONE MASTERFULLY AS IS HOWEVER IT WOULD FEEL SO MUCH LESS EPIC AND WOULD REALLY BE A MUCH LESS SATISFYING READ IF HE DID THIS IMO

IN SHORT IN PART THE AUTHOR GOES INTO FLASHY FUN WELL-WRITTEN EXTRA DETAIL ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF CT THAT MAY NOT BE CRUCIAL TO THE PLOT ITSELF BUT IS CRUCIAL TO THE SCOPE OF THE NOVEL

I DON'T THINK YOU'RE NECESSARILY READING SUPERFICIALLY IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE STORYTELLING FOR THIS PARTICULAR WORK IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO READ WITH A MORE CRITICAL EYE I THINK THAT THERE WILL BE MORE MATERIAL TO WORK WITH IN THE LATTER PORTION OF THE TEXT WITHOUT SPOILING ANYTHING THE BOOK BECOMES MORE CEREBRAL AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING AS THE STORY DEVELOPS ULTIMATELY WHETHER THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR THE STAND TO BE ANALYZED ON A DEEP LEVEL OR NOT WILL DEPEND ON ONE'S SENSIBILITIES
IT'S A DENSE BOOK I REVISITED IT YEARS LATER AND UNDERSTOOD A LOT MORE OF THE CONTEXT THAN I ORIGINALLY DID ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO AND RESPECTIVE MOTIVATIONS THE OPENING THIRD IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE IN ALL OF LITERATURE AND I LOVE THE DESCRIPTIONS OF EVENTS HAPPENING THROUGHOUT NEW YORK AS PEOPLE SUCCUMB TO TRIPS

THE MARVEL COMIC TIE-IN SERIES ALSO SHOWS A LOT OF WORLD-BUILDING AND EXPANDS ON CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE BOOKS FROM WHAT I'VE READ SO FAR

THERE'S ALSO THE MINISERIES WHICH DIALS SOME STUFF DOWN THE HUMAN ZOO SOME OF THE MORE UNSAVORY ELEMENTS FOR A REALLY GOOD PART STORY
I HAVEN'T READ IT IN YEARS BUT I LIKED IT IT WOULD IN POSITION BEHIND SALEM LOT AND IT FOR BEST KING BOOKS
THE BEGINNING IS DEFINITELY THE EASIER SECTION TO READ THAT BOOK HAS SUCH A LONG JOURNEY THAT IT CAN'T POSSIBLY ALL BE INTERESTING TO READ ABOUT I RECALL GETTING PRETTY BORED ABOUT THROUGH BUT STILL SLOWLY CHOPPING THROUGH IT AND THE ENDING IS GOOD SO IT'S ALL WORTH IT HOPE YOU ENJOY
JUST WANTED TO NOTE THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO VERSIONS OF THE STANDARD THE ORIGINAL AND THEN THE UNCUT VERSION WHICH RESTORED A FEW HUNDRED PAGES OF THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT
I ENJOYED BOTH VERSIONS AND THEY ARE OF COURSE VASTLY SUPERIOR TO THE VARIOUS MOVIE TV VARIATIONS
I'M READING THE STAND RIGHT NOW TOO AND I JUST FINISHED PART ONE IT'S MY FIRST KING BOOK AND I HONESTLY THINK IT COULD BE THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ OR A CLOSE SECOND BEHIND BRIGHT SHINY MORNING BY JAMES FREY THE STORYTELLING IS AMAZING THE CHARACTERS ARE EASY TO FOLLOW I DON'T LIKE RITA OR HAROLD THOUGH AND THE DESCRIPTIONS OF EVENTS ARE FLAWLESS I LOVE THIS BOOK
I'M THE UNCUT VERSION NOW I FIRST READ IT IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I CAN SEE THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS I MISSED OR DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THE FIRST TIME AROUND ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT WORK IS HIS TREATMENT OF CHARACTERS AND THE STAND MAY BE ONE OF THE FINEST EXAMPLES OF THIS HE HAS A REAL TALENT FOR SEEING PEOPLE I THINK AND THAT REALLY COMES THROUGH IN HIS WORK HIS CHARACTERS ARE PEOPLE WE COULD ALL KNOW IN REAL LIFE WE CAN RELATE TO THE SITUATIONS BETTER BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE COULD BE OUR NEIGHBORS OUR PARENTS OUR FRIENDS US THE STAND WEAVES SOME INCREDIBLE REALISM INTO A WEIRDLY SUPERNATURAL STORY AND AS ONE OF THE COMMENTERS HAS SAID THERE IS MORE MATERIAL LATER IN THE STORY THAT MAY PROVIDE SOME INTERESTING THOUGHT FOOD
OBVIOUSLY THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE TIME FOR THE US TO BECOME PART OF BRITAIN AGAIN THAT WOULD SOLVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS

IT WAS A GOOD RUN I THINK THE UNITED STATES WAS A FUN IDEA THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH

IT WAS PREVIOUSLY RESTRICTED TO THE UK THE COMMONWEALTH IRELAND

OK MAKES SENSE

AND ZIMBABWE

CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY ZIMBABWE IS INCLUDED IT SEEMS RANDOM
ON ANOTHER NOTE BARNES NEW BOOK SHOULD I READ IT
THIS AMERICAN WHO LOVED THE SELLOUT CAN AGREE WITH THIS SENTIMENT

THOUGH MAYBE IT WON'T ONLY TIME WILL TELL
BARNES WHO IS A WONDERFUL WRITER BY THE WAY HAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST HERE SINCE THE MORE COMPETITION THERE IS THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR HIM TO WIN

ON THE OTHER HAND I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BOOKER BEING RESTRICTED TO THE COMMONWEALTH AND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT BEING OPEN TO ALL NOVELS IN ENGLISH THE AWARD JUST NEEDS TO DECIDE WHETHER IT WANTS TO BE A REGIONAL OR A WORLDWIDE AWARD AND BOTH CHOICES ARE FINE
IT'S GOTTA BE EXCLUSIVELY ABOUT BOOK SALES PERSONALLY SINCE THEY'VE ALLOWED AMERICANS I'VE CONSUMED THE LONELIEST BOUGHT SOME LIBRARIES SOME DOWNLOADED THEM I'M SO FOND OF THE AWARD STARTING IN I'M GONNA GO BACKWARDS AND TRY AND GET TO AS MANY OF THE PREVIOUS NOMINEES AND WINNERS AS POSSIBLE

BUT AT THE SAME TIME I AGREE WITH BARNES
BASICALLY BITTER OLD MAN IS MAD THAT NOBODY HAD HEARD OF HIM UNTIL HE WON AND NOW FEELS THAT HIS NEW NOVELS WILL NO LONGER WIN BECAUSE OF AMERICANS HARDLY

HIS ARGUMENT IS POINTLESS THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD IS FOR

TO RAISE THE CULTURAL APPRECIATION OF GREAT WRITING IN AMERICA

SO BRITAIN FALLS NOWHERE INTO THAT

THE PULITZER

THE PULITZER PRIZE IS AN AWARD FOR ACHIEVEMENTS IN NEWSPAPER MAGAZINE AND ONLINE JOURNALISM LITERATURE AND MUSICAL COMPOSITION IN THE UNITED STATES

AGAIN SPECIFICALLY THE US

THE MAN BOOKER WAS ALWAYS JUST ABOUT AWARDING THE BEST ENGLISH LANGUAGE BOOK THE WHOLE EMPIRE ONLY THING IS OUTDATED LITERARY CRITICISM THAT ASSERTS THAT THE U KING IS REGULARLY PRODUCING THE ONLY IMPORTANT REAL LITERATURE COMPARED TO THE US OUTPUT
AGREED
SHUT YOUR COMPUTER DOWN MIN BEFORE BED GRAB A BOOK AND READ DURING THAT TIME INSTEAD
HONESTLY WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS JUST DISCIPLINE MAKING YOURSELF DO SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD FOR YOU IS A LIFE SKILL YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIGURE OUT
TRY TO FIND MOTIVATION FROM YOURSELF NOT AN EXTERNAL SOURCE FOR ME WHEN I FIND MYSELF NOT READING AS MUCH I'LL FOCUS ON WANTING TO LEARN MORE IMPROVE MY VOCABULARY SPEND LESS TIME IN FRONT OF SCREENS WORK ON MY IMAGINATION ETC I HAVE ALSO FOUND ONCE I AM IN THE GROOVE OF READING IT IS MUCH EASIER TO KEEP IT GOING FIND A BOOK THAT REALLY SOUNDS FASCINATING FOR YOU AND THEN GO FROM THERE
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO DISCOVER THAT READING CAN ACTUALLY BE REALLY FUN DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT YOUR SCHOOL OR YOUR PARENTS THINK YOU SHOULD BE READING BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF DON'T TRY AND CONVINCE YOURSELF YOU WANT TO READ DOSTOYEVSKY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO IF YOU WANT TO READ SOMETHING ABOUT SHOTGUN WIELDING VAMPIRES GO FOR IT THERE ARE BOOKS OUT THERE THAT YOU WILL WANT TO START READING AND THAT YOU'LL ENJOY READING YOU JUST NEED TO FORGET ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO READ FOR NOW AT LEAST

AS A GAMER YOU MIGHT WANT TO START WITH A VIDEOGAME TIE-IN NOVEL THERE ARE PLENTY OF THOSE SET IN THE UNIVERSES OF GAMES SUCH AS HALO OR DRAGON AGE YOU COULD EVEN START OUT BY LISTENING TO AN AUDIOBOOK THEN TRANSITION TO READING THE TEXT AFTER A FEW CHAPTERS ONCE YOU'VE BECOME INVESTED IN THE STORY AND JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

ALL YOU NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON IS DEVELOPING A TASTE FOR THE ACT OF READING BY FINDING THE STUFF YOU ENJOY THEN YOU'LL FIND YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WANT TO READ MORE AND EVENTUALLY YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF HELPLESSLY WANTING TO READ DEEPER MORE IMPORTANT BOOKS AFTER THE THRILL OF THE LIGHTER STUFF WEARS OFFICIAL IT'S LIKE GAMING OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU PROBABLY ENJOY WAY MORE COMPLEX AND DEEP GAMES THAN YOU USED TO DON'T YOU BUT IF YOU'D TRIED TO FORCE YOURSELF TO PLAY THE DEEPER MORE COMPLEX GAMES FIRST YOU PROBABLY NEVER GOT INTO GAMING AS A HOBBY

THE READING LOGS AND THE WHAT I'M GUESSING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE OF SCHOOLING PRESSURE TO READ STUFF THAT DOESN'T EXCITE YOU SUCKS AND SADLY THAT MIGHT JUST HAVE TO BE SOMETHING YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO PUSH THROUGH BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE A READER JUST FORGET ALL THAT STUFF FORGET HOW RESPECTABLE THE STUFF YOU'RE READING IS AND FORGET HOW MUCH OF IT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE READING JUST TRY AND FIND THE STUFF THAT YOU ENJOY READING WHICH I PROMISE IS OUT THERE AND IT WILL ALL FLOW EFFORTLESSLY FROM THERE

ALTERNATIVELY JUST TELL YOUR TEACHERS YOU READ THROUGH THIS ENTIRE LONG ASS COMMENT AND THEY'LL SURELY GIVE YOU AN A
FIGURING OUT HOW TO CHANGE YOUR HABITS TO SUIT WHAT YOU NEED IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL YOU CAN LEARN IT'S HONESTLY SOMETHING THAT ONLY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO

WE CAN GIVE ADVICE I'M SURE THAT MANY WILL BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT REALLY KNOW WHAT DRIVES YOU
MAKE A RULE FOR YOURSELF I WILL READ FOR MINUTES AND THEN DO WHATEVER STICK TO THAT RULE MINUTES IS NOT THAT MUCH TIME YOU CAN SUFFER THROUGH MINUTES BEFORE HOPPING ON THE COMPUTER

AS YOU BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE WITH READING EXPAND THE TIME TO MINUTES OR DO 2 SESSIONS OF WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU

YOU MAY ALSO DO PAGE AMOUNTS LIKE I WILL READ A CHAPTER OR I WILL READ PAGES TRY DIFFERENT WAYS STICK TO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULDN'T READING FOR PLEASURE IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN READING FOR REQUIREMENT AND IF SOMEONE DOESN'T ALREADY FEEL LIKE READING IT ISN'T WORTH THE EFFORT TO HOUND THEM INTO DOING SO

IF YOU HAVE REQUIRED READING FOR SCHOOL TREAT IT AS HOMEWORK CARRY THE BOOK WITH YOU AND SNEAK IN A FEW PAGES DURING DOWNTIME IN CLASS WHILE WAITING FOR THE BUS OR WHENEVER YOU HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO KILL
HONESTLY I'D START BASIC READ SOME GOOD TRASHY NOVELS LIKE SOME WITH BAD ROMANCE OR SOMETHING THE PLOT AND CHARACTERS ARE EASY AND ITS LIKE WATCHING A SOAPI EVENTUALLY YOU CAN START MOVING UP A BIT AND FIND OUT WHERE YOUR INTERESTS LIE ALTERNATIVELY TRY AND FIND SOME BOOKS SIMILAR TO THE GAMES YOU PLAY SINCE THEY SEEM TO PEAK YOUR INTEREST
SHORT STORIES
I ALWAYS RECOMMEND THE HOBBIT AS A GREAT FIRST BOOK
FIND A SUBJECT MATTER THAT INTEREST YOU AND CHOSE A TITLE ABOUT THAT IF READING ON A SCREEN IS EASIER FOR YOU GET THE KINDLE APP AND READ ON YOUR PHONE
YOU NEED TO FIND THE RIGHT BOOK DON'T BE AFRAID TO GO OFF THE BEATEN PATH OR TRY ANYTHING ANYTHING THAT CATCHES YOUR FANCY ONCE YOU GET ENGROSSED BY THE RIGHT STORY YOU WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM MAINTAINING DISCIPLINE

ALSO IT'S FINE TO ADMIT THAT READING JUST ISN'T FOR YOU
FIND A SUBJECT YOU'RE VERY INTERESTED IN AND THEN FIND A GOOD BOOK ABOUT IT LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE
A TRICK THAT I USED TO DO IS READ A MINIMUM OF PAGES EVERY DAY EVERYONE CAN FIND TIME TO READ A MEASLY PAGES EVEN JUST RIGHT BEFORE BED OR WOKE ON THE TOILET I FIND THAT I USUALLY BECOME INTERESTED IN WHAT I'M READING AND WILL EXCEED THE PAGES NATURALLY AND IF NOT YOU'LL STILL END UP READING ABOUT BOOKS A YEAR WHICH IS WAY MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE
TRY LISTENING TO AUDIOBOOKS IN THE CAR OR WHEN YOU HAVE DOWN TIME THROUGHOUT THE DAY THAT WAY YOU'RE USING TIME YOU WOULDN'T SPEND IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER ANYWAY
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN READING FOR WORK AND READING FOR LEISURE TO READ FOR WORK YOU SIMPLY ACCEPT THAT IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO AS ANOTHER COMMENTER SAID THAT'S JUST DISCIPLINE

FOR LEISURE I REALLY DON'T THINK READING IS INTRINSICALLY ANY MORE WORTHY A HOBBY THAN GAMING OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH IS TO SAY IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT TO DO PICK UP SOMETHING THAT INTERESTS YOU PERHAPS SOMETHING BASED ON THE LORE OF YOUR FAVORITE GAME OR SOMETHING THAT INSPIRED IT AND IF IT'S NOT THEN DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT HOBBIES SHOULD NOT BE FORCED
FOR ME IT WAS THE WITCHER BOOKS I SUNK HUNDREDS OF HOURS INTO THE GAMES AND THEN DECIDED TO READ THE BOOKS I'M GOING TO BE HONEST THOUGH WHY IS YOUR MOM MAKING YOU FILL OUT A BOOK LOG THAT AUTOMATICALLY WOULD REMOTIVATE ME FROM DOING SOMETHING
THIS ESSAY HAS SOME PRACTICAL TIPS
FIND A SUBJECT YOU ARE REALLY INTO AND START READING BOOKS IN THAT GENRE FOR ME I WAS YEARS OLD BEFORE I STARTED READING AND NOW YEARS LATER I SOMETIMES READ HOURS A DAY I STARTED WITH UFO AND ALIEN BOOKS AND HAVE NOW BRANCHED OUT TO OTHER SUBJECTS MY KINDE GOES EVERYWHERE WITH ME IF I CAN READ JUST A SENTENCE WHILE OUT SOMEWHERE I WILLIAM
IT IS AN HERETIC THAT MAKES THE FIRE
NOT SHE WHICH BURNS IN'T

WINTERS
HERESY IN RUSSIA IS A STRANGE THING DIDN'T A WHOLE BUNCH OF RUSSIANS GOT THEMSELVES EXCOMMUNICATED FOR CROSSING THEMSELVES WITH TWO FINGERS INSTEAD OF THREE AS THEIR PATRIARCH COMMANDED
THAT PICTURE OF HIM WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN IN COLOR THEN IT WASN'T COLORIZED LATER
IF YOU'RE THEN I'M
LITTLE KNOWN FACT HE WAS ORIGINALLY GOING TO TITLE WAR AND PEACE WAR WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR
I THINK THE TRUTH IS NONE OF US REALLY KNOW BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN VIRTUE IN BEING A SEEKER AND HONORING THE HONEST SEEKING OF OTHERS THIS IS THE HEART AND MIND THE CHURCH HAS LOST AT LEAST THE MOST VISIBLE ELEMENTS STREET AUGUSTINE AROUND AD SAID THE CHURCH IS ALWAYS IN NEED OF CONSTANT REFORM AND I THINK TOLSTOY HERETICAL DEFINITION HELPS BRING ABOUT THOSE REFORMS
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HERETIC

EXPLAINING THIS SEEMS LIKE A JOB FOR THE INQUISITION OF THE WARHAMMER IMPERIUM
LOOKS LIKE THE MODEL FOR THE COVER OF THE GIVER
SO MUCH COULD HAVE BEEN DONE WITH THIS TOPIC BUT THIS IS JUST HIGH SCHOOL BOOK REPORT
REMINISCENT OF DIALECTIC ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE END THE IDEA OF CONTINUAL CONTRADICTION IN SEARCH OF MORE COMPLETE COMMUNION I WONDER IF HE WAS INFLUENCED
AT THE SAME TIME TOLSTOY WROTE A BOOK ABOUT A WOMAN DYING FROM AN ABORTIFACIENT OVERDOSE I WANT TO SAY THAT THE SORT OF IRONY HE USED MAKES READING HIS PERSONAL THOUGHTS A LOT LIKE PANNING FOR GOLD
MAYBE I'M PART OF THE MINORITY IN THIS OPINION
FOR INSTANCE HE POSTULATES FIGURATIVELY THAT IF WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A CHURCH WHICH IN THE YEAR DECIDED TO RECEIVE THE UNCIRCUMCISED THIS CHURCH MADE ITS APPEARANCE ONLY BECAUSE THERE WAS AN OTHER CHURCH THAT OF THE JUDAIZING WHICH HAD DECIDED NOT TO RECEIVE THE UNCIRCUMCISED

I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY CIRCUMCISION OR THE LACK THERE OF WAS ANY SORT OF INDICATION OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN SURGERY HOW IT COULD HAVE ANY BEARING ON SPIRITUAL OR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IS QUITE BEYOND ME BUT SO ARE A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT VARIOUS RELIGIONS
THAT IS SO POORLY WRITTEN I JUST BAILED FUCK THAT IF YOU CAN'T WRITE DON'T
I KNOW I SOUND LIKE A PRICK BUT I DON'T CARE WHEN THERE IS A VERY BLATANT GRAMMATICAL MISTAKE IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF AN ARTICLE PRESENTING ITSELF AS BEING ACADEMIC I CAN'T GET PAST IT THAT GOT BY THE WRITER SPELLCHECK AND THE EDITOR
I CLICKED THE LINK THINKING TO MYSELF WHY THE HELL THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL POSING IN THE THUMBNAIL
SO BASICALLY HE SAYS THAT PEOPLE ONLY DISAGREE WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO DISAGREE ABOUT AND WHEN EVERYONE BELIEVES IN A CHURCH AS THE ULTIMATE ARBITER OF TRUTH AND THUS THE ULTIMATE ARGUMENT BY AUTHORITY THEN WHEN PEOPLE DISAGREE THEY MAY FORM A NEW CHURCH
WHAT'S THE BEST TRANSLATION FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU
AN UNDERSTAND OR AT LEAST A VARYING PERSPECTIVE OF HERESY IS OF VALUE TO THE INTELLECTUAL BECAUSE IT SPEAKS NOT ONLY TO THE CHURCH BUT ALSO TO LIFE IN GENERAL IN OTHER WORDS IT PROVIDES A CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATION FOR ANALYZING THE CURRENT CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD AND ITS RELATION TO DISSENTERS OF TODAY S POPULAR OPINIONS

THIS HURT MY BRAIN
LEO TOLSTOY REALLY LIKED KIDS SOMETIMES HE WOULD GET A WHOLE ROOM SO FULL TILL THERE WAS NO WHERE TO EVEN PLACE A STEP AND HE'S STILL YELLING MORE MORE
LEO TOLSTOY IS A HACK AND WAR AND PEACE IS ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED WORKS OF LITERATURE IN WORLD HISTORY LET'S FACE FACTS THE ONLY REASON ANYONE TACKLES ALL THESE PAGES AND ALL THESE CHARACTERS IS FOR BRAGGING RIGHTS IT'S FLAT IMPENETRABLE MEANDERING AND STULTIFYINGLY DULL
LEO TOLSTOY REALLY LIKED KIDS THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE'D WAKE UP EARLY CATCH A KID AND KEEP PETTING HIM ON THE HEAD AND PETTING HIM UNTIL HE WAS CALLED FOR BREAKFAST
TOLSTOY IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS WHO BELIEVE ONLY THEY ARE THE ONES COMPREHENDING GOD'S DIVINE MEANING
I KEPT ALL OF MY PHYSICAL BOOKS HAVE AROUND OF THEM I STILL BUY PHYSICAL BOOKS FOR AUTHOR'S THAT I FOLLOW OR SERIES THAT ARE STILL ONGOING SONG OF ICE AND FIRE FOR INSTANCE

I SWITCHED TO KINDLE BECAUSE IT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SHARE BOOKS WITH FAMILY I GOT KINDLES FOR MY FATHER MOTHER SISTER AND UNCLE ALL ON MY ACCOUNT NOW WHENEVER ONE OF US BUYS A BOOK EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO IT WE ALL LIVE IN DIFFERENT STATES HUNDREDS OF MILES APART SO PHYSICALLY LENDING PAPER BOOKS ISN'T PRACTICAL

I ACTUALLY LISTEN TO MORE AUDIOBOOKS THAN ANYTHING NOW I HAVE HUNDREDS OF AUDIBLE BOOKS VERY CONVENIENT
I BOUGHT A KINDLE AFTER MOVING TIMES IN YEARS AND MOVING ALL MY BOOKS WHICH WERE MOSTLY NOVELS

I GAVE TONS OF BOOKS AWAY AND DROPPED THE REST OFF AT A USED BOOK STORE SAVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF MY FAVORITES

I DON'T REGRET IT AT ALL

I REBOUGHT SOME BOOKS LATER BUT FOR THE MOST PART JUST LET THEM GO
I KEEP MY BOOKS I STILL BUY THEM KINDLE IS FOR TRAVELLING AND FOR BOOKS THAT I CAN'T FIND PHYSICAL COPIES OF
I CONVERTED TO KINDLE ABOUT YEARS AGO AND SINCE THEN MY PHYSICAL BOOK COLLECTION HAS BECOME JUST THAT A COLLECTION I LOVE THE APPEAL OF PHYSICAL COPIES FIRST EDITIONS AND RARE BOOKS AMAZE ME BUT FOR CONVENIENCE AND THE LOVE OF READING THE EASE OF IS BRILLIANT I'VE RECENTLY STARTED LOOKING INTO BUYING RARE AND FIRST EDITION PHYSICAL BOOKS AS A HOBBY I'M NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WITHOUT MY SHIFT TO
I KEPT MOST OF THEM I STILL LIKE TO MY PHYSICAL BOOKS AND PROBABLY WOULDN'T THEM ALL I LIKE THE KINDLE BECAUSE I CAN TRAVEL WITH LOTS OF BOOKS TO READ AND A LOT OF BOOKS ARE REALLY CHEAP
SOLD THEM TO A USED BOOKSTORE AND AT A YARDSALE KEPT A SMALL BOOKSHELF OF FAVORITES ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL ONES AND PICTURE BASED BOOKS
KEPT THEM BECAUSE NOTHING BEATS THE FEEL OF A GOOD BOOK
I ONLY USE KINDLE TO READ BOOKS ON THE GO I STILL PREFER PHYSICAL BOOKS AT HOME
KEPT ANYTHING I WOULD WANT TO SAVE DONATED A BUNCH TO NOLA POST KATRINA AND DONATED SOME MORE TO PRISON

GOT TO DEDUCT THEM FROM TAXES AND IT WAS EASY AND EFFICIENT FOR ME THE USED BOOK MARKET SEEMS TO BE REALLY DEAD AND HARD WORK
AMAZON HAS OUT OF COPYRIGHT BOOKS THAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FOR FREE ON YOUR KINDLE I SWAPPED PHYSICAL CLASSICS FOR THE KINDLE VERSION THAT WAY

AMAZON ALSO HAS A KINDLE MATCHBOOK PROGRAM THAT GIVES YOU A REDUCED PRICE ON THE KINDLE VERSION OF CERTAIN PHYSICAL BOOKS YOU HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED FROM THEM THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS IF YOU BOUGHT THE PHYSICAL BOOK AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE ELSE YOU CAN BUY THE KINDLE MATCHBOOK FOR YOURSELF
DONATED TO LOCAL LIBRARIES AND FRIENDS
WELL I DONT EVER BOOKS SO IT WASNT AN IMPOSITION FOR ME I GUESS YOU WOULD JUST KEEP YOUR OLD BOOKS TO IF YOU DO THAT AORTA THING NO WORSE OFF THEN YOU ARE CURRENTLY
A FEW YEARS AGO I GOT RID OF A BUNCH OF MY BOOKS TO MAKE MOVING EASIER I SOLD A FEW OF THE ONES ON AMAZON AND DONATED THE REST TO A LOCAL THRIFT SHOP THAT USES ITS PROFITS FOR CHARITY WORK ANOTHER TIME I DONATED A BUNCH TO MY LOCAL LIBRARY SO THEY COULD SELL THEM AT THEIR ANNUAL JULY 4TH BOOK SALE EVENT SOME USED BOOKSTORES WILL BUY USED BOOKS BUT EXPECT THEM TO BE PICKY AND NOT PAY A LOT
MINE ARE MOSTLY IN STORAGE WE'VE GIVEN AWAY ABOUT LARGE BOXES AS HEAVY AS WE CAN CARRY ALREADY AND HAVE ABOUT LARGE BOXES OF BOOKS THAT WE CAN'T BEAR TO PART WITH YET MOSTLY MY WIFE CAN'T BEAR TO PART WITH THEM BUT I'M GUILING OF WANTING TO KEEP SOME

IF WE HAD ALL OF THE BOOKS AVAILABLE IN BOOK FORMAT I'D GIVE THEM ALL AWAY TODAY MY WIFE STILL HAS TO HAVE HARD COPIES OF SOME OF HER FAVORITES EVEN WHEN SHE KNOWS SHE'LL NEVER THE PAPER BOOK AGAIN EVER

DID YOU BUY THEM AGAIN

A LOT OF THEM YES SOME WE WERE ABLE TO FIND FREE OR AT VERY LOW COSTS OTHERS WE PAID OR SO FOR I'LL BET I'VE PAID OUT IN BOOKS BOOKS AUDIOBOOKS AND MOVIES BASED ON BOOKS SINCE I'VE GOTTEN MARRIED
I GAVE SOME AWAY AND KEPT MANY OTHERS
I DONATED MOST OF MINE TO THE LOCAL LIBRARY I KEPT SOME OF THE HARDCOVERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH COLLECTOR POSSIBILITIES I NEVER READ A PAPER BOOK IF THE BOOK IS AVAILABLE
I USE TO BE INVOLVED IN TRAIL WORK YOU WORK AND LIVE IN THE BACK COUNTRY FOR MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR BECAUSE READING WAS SO VITAL TO KEEP ONE'S SANITY AND I ALWAYS HAD A COLLECTION IN MY VEHICLE BACK AT THE OFFICE I ALWAYS SEEM TO BECOME THE LIBRARIAN SOMEHOW EACH YEAR DARN BASTARDS NEVER RETURNED SHIT EITHER WAY I TALK UP MY FAVORITE BOOKS AND PUSH THEM ON PEOPLE CONSTANTLY THUS MY COLLECTION DWINDLED BY GIVING THEM AWAY KINDLE IS A GREAT SELFISH WAY TO KEEP MY COLLECTION TO MYSELF
I GAVE BOOKS THAT I HAD NO INTEREST IN TO THE LIBRARY FOR THE ANNUAL BOOK SALE I STILL BUY BOOKS THAT WOULD NOT BE GOOD ON A KINDLE ANYTHING HEAVY ON GRAPHICS OCCASIONALLY I HAVE REPURCHASED BOOKS FOR KINDLE THAT I ALREADY HAVE IN HARD COPY IF IT IS AMAZON DEAL OF THE DAY OR A BOOKBUB DEAL OR IF ITS A FAVORITE AUTHOR AND SOMETHING I WOULD TEND TO
THEY'RE STILL ON MY SHELF THOUGH I'M THINKING OF DONATING A FEW AT THIS POINT SINCE I KNOW I'M NOT REREADING THEM OR MAYBE BOXING THEM UP FOR MY YOUNGER RELATIVES
THE PRESUMPTION THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A KINDLE YOU BURN ALL YOUR BOOKS IS FLAWED YOU CAN CERTAINLY CONVERT OVER BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO A TON OF BOOKS JUST TO GET THEM ON THE KINDLE
SOLD THEM TO A USED BOOKSTORE AND GAVE THOSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO A LOCAL LIBRARY AND LITERACY PROGRAM
I BOUGHT ONE FAIRLY RECENTLY ABOUT A YEAR AGO IT WAS STRANGE AT FIRST BECAUSE I WANTED A NEW BOOK BUT I ALSO WANTED TO HAVE THAT NEW BOOK I MOVED OVER THE SUMMER AND GAVE A LOT OF OLD ONES AWAY AND HAD TO REALLY ASK MYSELF WHAT I WANTED TO KEEP

BASICALLY I SETTLED ON CONTINUING TO READ PULPY FICTION AND SCIENCE FICTION BOOKS ON KINDLE BECAUSE PHYSICALLY OWNING THEM DIDN'T BRING ME ANY SATISFACTION BUT I STILL BUY PHYSICAL COPIES OF SPECIAL BOOKS OR THE TYPES OF NON FICTION BOOKS THAT I COLLECTIVE PARTICULARLY HISTORY BOOKS THEY LOOK GOOD ON THE SHELF
I STILL HAVE THEM AND OCCASIONALLY I'LL ADD SOME AND DONATE OTHERS HAVE THEIR BENEFITS BUT SO DOES PRINTING UNLESS YOUR CURRENT BOOKS ARE GETTING IN THE WAY I AGREE THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IN DISPOSING OF THEM JUST TO BUY THEM AGAIN

THE BUILT IN DICTIONARY MAKES FANTASTIC FOR VOCAB BUILDING AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE READING
KEPT MY FAVORITES CURRENTLY I OWN ABOUT BOOKS THE REST I GAVE THEM AWAY TO FRIENDS COLLEAGUES LIBRARIES AND HOMELESS SHELTERS
KEPT MOST SOLD SOME DONATED SOME THE REAL CHANGE WAS ON INTAKE AS I NOW BUY MOSTLY BOOKS AND AT A MUCH SLOWER CLIP

I HAVE NOT ANY BOOKS I OWNED I DON'T THINK I WILL EITHER

I STILL HAVE A PHYSICAL LIBRARY OF OR SO
DONATED THEM ALL TO A SECOND HAND SHOP I MOVE A LOT SO GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO DRAG BOXES OF BOOKS AROUND WITH ME ANYMORE
I KEEP THEM NOT IN ONE LOCATION GRANTED I'VE BEEN IN COLLEGE FOR A FEW YEARS NOW BUT MY PARENT'S HOME IS STILL WHERE THE BULK OF MY OLD BOOKS ARE

ANY PHYSICAL BOOKS THAT I HAVE RECENTLY PURCHASED OR RECEIVED ARE ONES THAT I'VE READ OR FREQUENTLY REFER TO CERTAIN PASSAGES OF SO THEY SIT ON AN SHELF SAME WITH BOOKS OR EXPENSIVE ONES

THE KINDLE IS FOR BOOK SERIES TRAVEL AND BULK NOVELS A DEAL HAS TO BE REALLY REALLY GOOD TO BEAT THE CONVENIENCE OF HAVING AN ENTIRE NOVEL SERIES IN MY POCKET ALONG WITH OTHER OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM
I SOLD SOME GAVE MOST AWAY TO THE LOCAL THRIFT STORE PUT SOME IN STORAGE AND GAVE SOME TO FRIENDS
KEEPING THEM AND BUYING PHYSICAL COPIES FROM BOOK I READ ON MY KINDLE SHOULD NOT DO THAT BUT I FEEL LIKE ITS SO WRONG TO HAVE JUST A DIGITAL EDITION S
EVEN BEFORE I GOT MY KINDLE I WOULD SELL OLD BOOKS TO HALF PRICE BOOKS I STILL KEEP A LOT OF BOOKS FOR REFERENCE BUT I GET RID OF NOVELS SINCE I DON'T USUALLY REREAD THEM
I DO ALL MY READING ON MY KINDLE NOW BUT I STILL HAVE ALL THE PHYSICAL BOOKS I HAD BEFORE AND MIGHT BUY SOME PHYSICAL COPIES OF BOOKS I'VE READ DIGITALLY THAT I REALLY ENJOY IT'S NICE HAVING A PHYSICAL VERSION OF IT TO PAGE THROUGH OR LEND OUT TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY
MY IPOD AND HARDCOPY LIBRARIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT THE ONLY REASON FOR THE MINIMAL OVERLAP IS THAT SOME BOOKS I HAD IN HARDCOPY WERE AVAILABLE FOR FREE AS PART OF BUYING SOMETHING ELSE I WANTED FROM BADEN LATER ON

NOT EVERYTHING IS AVAILABLE AS AN SO THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A NEED FOR BOTH FORMS ALSO HARDCOPIES DON'T NEED CHARGING AND CAN BE READ IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
I LET FRIENDS TAKE WHAT THEY WANTED THEN THREW THE REST IN THE TRASH
THE STRANGER IS BASICALLY A REDUCTIO AD WELL ABSURDUM IT TAKES AN ABSURDIST CHARACTER I EAST SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES THAT THERE'S NO DEEPER MEANING TO BE FOUND IN LIFE AND WITH THE THE HELP OF EXTREMELY UNFORTUNATE EVENTS MAKES A STATEMENT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE LIKE MEURSAULT WOULD FAIR IN SOCIETY

CAMUS ONCE SAID THAT THE STRANGER IS ABOUT HOW ANY MAN WHO DOES NOT WEEP AT HIS MOTHER'S FUNERAL RUNS THE RISK OF BEING SENTENCED TO DEATH WHILE THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A HYPERBOLE WHICH HE LATER EXPANDED UPON YOU CAN SEE THIS SENTIMENT IN THE STORY

IF FEELING AND ACTIONS WERE MORE IN TUNE WITH SOCIETY HE CONDEMNED RAYMOND FOR BEATING HIS GIRLFRIEND AND THUS WOULDN'T HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM THIS PREVENTED HIM FROM EVEN GETTING INTO THE SITUATION WITH THE ARABS LIKEWISE IF HE HAD SHOWN REMORSE AND GUILT REGARDING THE MURDER HE PROBABLY CONVINCED THE CHAPLAIN TO PUT IN A GOOD WORD IN COURT AND SAVE HIM FROM THE DEATH PENALTY HE EASILY CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE AND GENERALLY CONFUSED FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER BUT HE DIDN'T BECAUSE HE WASN'T
MEURSAULT TO ME IS NOT A SOCIOPATH HE'S A GUY WHO SEES THINGS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND SOCIETY OSTRACIZES HIM FOR IT HOW DARE HE NOT SHOW EMOTION IN THE PRESCRIBED WAY EVEN IF IT ISN'T IN HIS HEART SURELY HE LOVED HIS MOTHER BUT IN HIS OWN WAY

AS SOMEBODY WHO'S AUTISTIC I SEE A LOT OF MYSELF IN MEURSAULT WE HAVE FEELINGS WE HAVE EMPATHY WE JUST SHOW THEM IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAT SOCIETY'S CONVENTIONS DON'T OFTEN PICK UP ON MEURSAULT HAS A SORT OF DISCONNECT WITH THE NORMAL PEOPLE AROUND HIM THOUGH THEY ALL COME FROM THE SAME PLACE HE IS A STRANGER AMONG THEM
TO ME MEURSAULT IS LIVING HIS LIFE IN HIS OWN WAY BUT THE SOCIETY AROUND HIM SEES HIM LIVING IT IN THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE WHICH LEADS TO THE CONFLICT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS MOTHER I DON'T BELIEVE WAS LOVING OR CARING SO HE WOULDN'T FEEL THAT WAS DURING HER FUNERAL BUT NO ONE ELSE KNEW THAT SO THEY JUST THOUGHT HE WAS AN ASS
ONE COMMENT I GOT ON YOUR QUESTION EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A REAL RESPONSE HERE IS THAT THE WAY I WAS TAUGHT THE BOOK WAS THAT THE SUN IN HIS EYES WAS REALLY KIND OF JUST A SUBSTITUTE FOR THERE BEING A REAL REASON FOR HIM DOING IT AT LEAST IN TERMS OF HOW HE ARTICULATES IT FOR REAL THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HIS CHARACTER A WHOLE SORT OF ATMOSPHERE OF CRIMINALITY THAT HE ENTERS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SAYING THE SUN WAS IN HIS EYES KIND OF PRECLUDES ANY REASON HE HIMSELF COULD PRODUCE HAVING TO DO WITH THAT

I READ THE BOOK IN HIGH SCHOOL TOO IN FRENCH CLASSICAL MY TEACHER WAS FRENCH AND HER MAIN PREOCCUPATION WITH THE BOOK WAS THAT SHE SAW A COMMENT ON THE DEATH PENALTY I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT THESE APPARENTLY INSUBSTANTIAL REASONS EAST G THE SUN IN HIS EYES ARE WHAT LEAD TO A REALLY MATERIAL PUNISHMENT I EAST GETTING EXECUTED

I DON'T REMEMBER IT TOO WELL BUT THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE TIME IN FRANCE WAS SORT OF STARTING TO GET SIGNIFICANTLY QUESTIONED SO HONESTLY GIVEN THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE I THINK A READING OF THE BOOK INFORMED BY THE GRAVITY OF THE PARTICULAR ISSUE AT THE TIME MIGHT GIVE SOME USEFUL INSIGHT IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE PIECING TOGETHER A MEANING FOR YOURSELF IN COLLEGE I GOT INTO READER THEORY SO I DO THINK YOUR OWN INTERPRETATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT THOUGH BUT THAT DOESN'T FIGURE SO SIGNIFICANTLY IN HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL LITERATURE

SO AT THE END OF THE DAY IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE LESS USEFUL TO ANTHOLOGIZE MEURSAULT AS A SOCIOPATH THOUGH IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE A BIT OF DISCONNECT WITH OTHER PEOPLE SORT OF SIGNIFIED IN HIS INABILITY TO ARTICULATE HIS MOTIVATIONS AS ANYTHING REACHING ANYONE ELSE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE IDENTIFYING AS HIS NEGLECT OF THE TRUTH AND FURTHER THERE'S OF COURSE THE IDEA THAT WHAT WENT INTO COMMITTING THE CRIME WAS SORT OF MEANINGLESS AND THE PUNISHMENT WAS THEN COMPLETELY DISPROPORTIONATE EVEN THOUGH THERE IS SOME TYPES OF CHANGES HE GOES THROUGH AT THE END IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY WHICH I'M ONLY SAYING IS HOW I UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE I WAS TAUGHT THE BOOK AS PRIMARILY A CRITICISM OF THE DEATH PENALTY

TAKE THIS IN A MORE COMPLICATED DIRECTION AND ASK YOURSELF CAN ANYTHING BE TRULY MEANINGLESS PARTICULARLY IF SOMETHING APPARENTLY MEANINGLESS ENDS UP GETTING YOU KILLED THAT TYPE OF QUESTION MIGHT HELP YOU EXPAND ON YOUR NEEDS TO FIND MEANING IN EVERYTHING BUT NEGLECTS THE TRUTH STATEMENT

EDIT ONE LAST THING ON THE DEATH PENALTY I THINK WE ALSO READ A BRIEF THING CAMUS ALSO WROTE ABOUT ANOTHER APPLICATION OF THE DEATH PENALTY WHERE HE SAID SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF THE CRIME WAS KIND OF INSIGNIFICANT EDIT ACTUALLY I'M THINKING ABOUT IT AND I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE SAID IT WAS KIND OF HEINOUS BUT THE EXECUTION SUDDENLY GAVE IT A NEW MEANING IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE BEFORE AND ACTUALLY LEFT THE PEOPLE WHO HAD WATCHED THE EXECUTION FEELING SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS THE PERSON WHO WAS KILLED WHEN A MOMENT BEFORE THEY WERE ALL OUT FOR BLOOD JUSTICE ABOUT WHAT HE HAD DONE
THE MEURSAULT INVESTIGATION BY AMIL ADOD IS A REALLY INTERESTING CRITIQUE OF THE STRANGER ITS WRITTEN BY AN ALGERIAN WRITER ABOUT THE BROTHER OF THE MAN MEURSAULT KILLED AS HE TRIES TO COME TO TERMS WITH HIS LOSS AND UNDERSTAND WHY MEURSAULT KILLED HIM
THE SUN GLINTING OFF OF THE ARAB'S KNIFE HURTS EYES HE NEEDS TO STOP THE PAIN AND HE HAPPENS TO HAVE A GUN SO HE PULLS THE TRIGGER THEN HE PULLS IT AGAIN AND AGAIN

THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL REASON TO WHAT HE DOES IT DOESN'T REPRESENT ANYTHING IT ISN'T A METAPHORICAL IN FACT MEURSAULT IS PRETTY DETACHED FROM EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN HIS LIFE EXCEPT FOR SENSORY INPUT HE IS EXTREMELY IN TUNE WITH SENSORY INPUT HE IS VERY OBSERVANT HE IS OBSESSED WITH THINGS LIKE HEAT PHYSICAL COMFORT SEXUAL PLEASURE SIMPLE LAUGHTER A PRETTY VIEW HE CAN FIND HEAVEN IN A SINGLE AFTERNOON ON THE PORCH HE CAN FIND HELL IN A BLAZING HOT AFTERNOON AT THE BEACH HE IS NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH YESTERDAY OR TOMORROW HE CARES ABOUT RIGHT NOW

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NIHILISM AND ABSURDISM IS CHIEFLY THAT OF ATTITUDE THE NIHILIST REJECTS A MEANINGLESS WORLD THE ABSURDIST ACCEPTS IT TO CAMUS LIFE WAS LIKE ROLLING A BOULDER UP A HILL ONLY TO HAVE IT TUMBLE BACK DOWN AGAIN THE ONLY SMART THING TO DO WAS TO ACCEPT IT AND EMBRACE IT CHOOSE TO LIVE AN ABSURD LIFE
I JUST READ THIS BOOK AND FINISHED IT ABOUT HOURS AGO I ALSO READ IT FOR SCHOOL SPECIFICALLY MY IB ENGLISH LITERATURE CLASSICAL MEURSAULT IS ODD HE IS INHERENTLY ALIEN HE IS THE STRANGER AFTER ALL I'VE HEARD SOMEONE DESCRIBE THE RANGE OF HUMAN EMOTION AS A SCALE BETWEEN AND WITH MOST PEOPLE GOING BETWEEN AND MOST OF THE TIME ON SUCH A SCALE MEURSAULT WOULD USUALLY HOVER BETWEEN AND AND THAT'S BEING GENEROUS I FEEL LIKE THE WORD SOCIOPATH IS A BROAD TERM THAT WE EXTERNALLY APPLY ON PEOPLE PERHAPS TOO OFTEN BUT I DO THINK THAT IF MEURSAULT HAD HIS TRIAL TODAY PEOPLE WOULD DEFINITELY USE IT TO DESCRIBE HIM THAT DOES NOT HOWEVER MEAN THAT CAMUS HAD THAT VERY IDEA IN MIND WHEN CREATING THE CHARACTER LET'S BE CAREFUL TO APPLY OUR CURRENT ARCHETYPES ONTO CHARACTERS THAT COME FROM A DIFFERENT TIME AS WE MAY LOSE SOME INTRICACIES BY DOING SO
DISTANCE FROM THE AVERAGE PERSON DOES AFFECT HIM I THINK THAT THIS IN COMBINATION WITH HIS FEAR IS WHAT FILLS HIM WITH SO MUCH HATE BY THE END OF THE BOOK THE LINE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS I FELT THE STUPID URGE TO CRY BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM HATED ME REALLY STRUCK ME UNLIKE THE PROSECUTOR WOULD HAVE US THINK I DON'T BELIEVE MEURSAULT IS A PURE MONSTER I AM SYMPATHETIC TO HIS CHARACTER DESPITE HIS MANY ANTISOCIAL QUALITIES THERE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE HIM LIKEABLE BESIDES OF COURSE SIMPLY BEING THE MAIN CHARACTER MEURSAULT TAKES JOY IN MANY THINGS IN LIFE DESPITE HIS OVERALL SUBDUED AND WEAK EMOTIONS UNLIKE RAYMOND FOR EXAMPLE MEURSAULT RARELY THINKS ABOUT HURTING PEOPLE OR GETTING ANY SORT OF REVENGE WHICH IS PART OF THE REASON HIS MURDER IS SO PERPLEXING AS A SIDE NOTE HE HAS A FEW HILARIOUS LINES SHE TOLD ME TO CALL THE POLICE I TOLD HER I DIDN'T LIKE COPS A BIG QUESTION I HAD FROM EARLY ON IN THE BOOK WAS IF HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE WAY HE IS THE ANSWER TO THIS COMES IN TWO PARTS FIRSTLY HE DOES SAY THAT HE WAS FULL OF ALL SORTS OF AMBITIONS WHEN HE WAS A STUDENT BUT HE WAS FORCED TO GIVE THEM UP AND FOUND HIM SELF HAPPY ENOUGH WITHOUT THEM SECOND AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HE LET'S US IN ON SOMETHING VERY TELLING DURING THE TRIAL I HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TRULY FEEL REMORSE FOR ANYTHING THIS TO ME IS A KEY PART OF HIS CHARACTER HE SIMPLY GOES ALONG WITH LIFE WHATEVER HAPPENS TO ANYONE HIS MOTHER'S DEATH WAS A MILDLY BAD DAY TO HIM ONLY THE THREAT OF IMMINENT DEATH THE END TO THE LIFE WHICH IT IS IN HIS NATURE TO SIMPLY FLOAT THROUGH AND WHAT HE PERCEIVES TO BE THE HATRED OF ALL OF MANKIND CAN GET TRULY STIR UP INTENSE EMOTIONS IN HIM WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO MEURSAULT FOR SURE MY SYMPATHY FOR HIM MAKES ME HOPE HIS APPEAL IS GRANTED AS THAT IS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT PLAUSIBLE BUT ULTIMATELY THIS STORY IS NOT REALLY ABOUT HIS VERY END HE COULD DIE THE NEXT DAY OR YEARS FROM THEN THE STORY AT LEAST WHEN FOCUSING SOLELY ON HIS CHARACTER AND NOT ANY STATEMENTS IT MAY BE MAKING ABOUT SOCIETY AS A WHOLE IS RATHER ABOUT HIS EMOTIONAL ARC FROM BEING INCAPABLE OF FEELING ANYTHING OTHER THAN CONTENT IRRITATION AND DESIRE TO FULL OF DESPERATE HOPE AND MISANTHROPIC HATE IF HE SURVIVED IT'S HARD TO SAY WHETHER THIS CHANGE WOULD BE PERMANENT I THINK THAT IS MORE LEFT UP TO US TO THINK ABOUT AS FAR AS THE MURDER ITSELF THAT DOES PERPLEX ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE PERHAPS THAT WAS THE RESULT OF MEURSAULT REACHING AN EMOTIONAL HEIGHT HE WASN'T USED TO HE WAS EXTREMELY STRESSED ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE SCARED AND HE SAW THE MAN HE MAY HAVE PERCEIVED AS CAUSING IT ALL SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND TAKING SUCH AN ACTION IT WAS SO UNFAMILIAR TO HIM THAT HE EXTERNALIZED THE CAUSE BLAMING THE PHYSICAL IRRITATION HE WAS EXPERIENCING FOR HIS ACTIONS THAT'S JUST THE BEST I UNDERSTAND IT
WHY DO YOU LIKE HIM LESS AS A PERSON GENUINELY CURIOUS BECAUSE YOUR POST MAKES IT SEEM LIKE YOU'D LIKE HIM MORE AT THE END OF IT ALL
YIKES MOMENTS THAT MAKE YOU DOUBT THEIR SOUL AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL COULD YOU GIVE SOME EXAMPLES PLEASE OF SUCH MOMENTS
HAVEN'T READ IT AND DON'T PLAN TO BUT I HEARD HIS INTERVIEW WITH TERRY GROSS AND I HAVE TO SAY I WAS IMPRESSED WITH HIS LINGUISTIC ABILITIES
YOU SHOULD REALLY CHECK OUT THE RECENT CBS SUNDAY MORNING PIECE ON HIM REALLY INTERESTING
IF ONLY NOAH WAS FUNNY EVEN REMOTELY AS FUNNY AS JON STEWART OR STEPHEN COLBERT PERHAPS THE MEMOIR INADVERTENTLY EXPLAINS WHY HE ISN'T EVEN IF IT IS THE TAIL WAGGING THE DOG
I REMEMBER LOVING SHORT STORIES SO I WOULD LIKE TO READ THIS ONE SOME TIME I GOOGLED IT JUST TO CHECK WHETHER IT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE IT ISN'T AS FAR AS I CAN TELL BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO BE PUT RIGHT IF ANYONE FINDS A LINK
ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS SERIOUSLY LOVE IT AND HAVE READ IT MULTIPLE TIMES

YOU CANNOT READ THIS TYPE OF BOOK CONSTANTLY EXPECTING THE CHARACTERS TO HAVE MODERN WAYS OF THINKING IT'S OUTRAGEOUS TO THINK THAT PEOPLE YEARS AGO SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT STALKING SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR HUMAN RIGHTS

THE SOCIETY IS A TOTALLY ALIEN ONE AND WE CAN SAY IT'S AWFUL NOW BUT WE CAN'T JUDGE THOSE PEOPLE AGAINST STANDARDS WOMEN WERE MARRIED OFF FOR PROFIT THEN THEY TOOK LOVERS AND THE RICH ONES GAVE THEIR HUSBAND'S MONEY TO THEIR POORER LOVERS A DESTITUTE BEGGAR MIGHT BE PLEASED TO HAVE A ROOF AND A BLANKET AND MAYBE EVEN A HUNK OF CHEESE THAT WOULD MAKE HIM GRATEFUL ENOUGH TO BE TREATED LIKE A PUPPY BY HIS NEW MASTER SERVANTS TOOK PRIDE IN THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE WITH DISTINCTION AND ALSO IN THEIR MASTERS WEIRD MAYBE BUT TRUE JUST LOOK AT A SHOW LIKE DOWNTON ABBEY SOME OF THOSE SERVANTS REALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR BOSSES AND FEEL LIKE THEIR MASTER'S IMPRESSIVENESS RUBS OFF ON THEM

SECONDLY IT'S MEANT TO BE HUMOROUS AND FUN AND EXCITING EVERYTHING IS EXAGGERATED AND SLIGHTLY RIDICULOUS AND AND THAT WAY DUMAS CAN BE POKING FUN BUT STILL POINTING OUT THE ISSUES LIKE THE ONGOING WAR WITH ENGLAND AND THE STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE KING AND THE CARDINAL AND IT WAS PUBLISHED IN A TIME OF UNREST NOT LONG BEFORE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION SO THESE ARE ISSUES HIS READERS WOULD RESPOND TO

LAST I THINK YOU MISSED QUITE A LOT OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT OR AT LEAST THE GRADUAL DEEPENING OF EACH CHARACTER'S PERSONAS RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING WE SEE FATHER TELLING HIM TO FIGHT DUELS AT THE DROP OF A HAT AND WE SEE THAT HE'S ALWAYS A POWDER KEG ABOUT TO GO OFFICIAL BUT SLOWLY HE'S GIVEN THE CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS AND HE COMES UP WITH WONDERFULLY INTELLIGENT PLANS AND STOPS RUSHING AROUND LIKE A PINBALL HE BECOMES A PARTNER AND A FRIEND AND A LEADER ATHOS GETS HIS TRAGIC HISTORY AND NOBILITY ARAMIS GETS HIS SECRET LOVER AND HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ORTHOS HIS EMBARRASSING LOVER AND MANIPULATIONS

NONE OF THEM ARE MEANT TO BE PERFECT THEY'RE ALL KIND OF MESSED UP BUT THEY ALL HAVE REDEEMING QUALITIES LIKE HONOR AND BRAVERY AND A SENSE OF ADVENTURE AND LOYALTY TO EACH OTHER ONLY CAN BE EXPECTED TO CHANGE VERY MUCH THE OTHERS ARE ALL GROWN MEN ESTABLISHED IN PERSONALITY AND SET IN THEIR CHARACTERS ALREADY WHEN WE MEET THEM

TL R SORRY I WENT ON A RANT I THINK YOU MAYBE MISSED OUT ON THE HUMOR OR IT JUST WASN'T YOUR KIND OF HUMOR WHICH IS TOTALLY OKAY AND YOU WERE TOO DISTRACTED BY THE DIFFERENCES IN THE SOCIETY WHICH IS ALSO TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE I'M JUST BUMMED YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT
I'M NOT GOING TO DEFEND THE BOOK OBVIOUSLY IT OFFENDED YOU BUT PERSONALLY I LIKED THE WAY IT HUMOROUSLY PORTRAYED THE GALLANT MUSKETEERS AS FAULTY HUMAN BEINGS AT A TIME WHEN TESTOSTERONE WAS KING AND PEOPLE WERE JUST AS NARROW AS WELL AS THEY ARE NOW AND LIKE NOW THEY WERE CAUGHT UP IN RIDICULOUS IDEAS OF PROPER BEHAVIOR WHICH AT THE TIME WERE BLINDLY FOLLOWED

ANOTHER BOOK OF HISTORICAL FICTION THAT ALSO POINTED OUT THE VAGARIES OF LOCAL CULTURE WAS BY JAMES CAVELL MAYBE IT'S A SIGN OF HOW FAR WE HAVE COME THAT YOU WOULD FIND THESE TREATMENTS OF THE PAST OFFENSIVE
IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I RECALL FROM MOVIES I EXPECTED A DIFFERENT ENDING BUT I LIKED THE END


THIS IS ONE OF THOSE STORIES THAT WORKS BETTER AS A MOVIE THAN AS A BOOK ALL THE SWORDFIGHTING AND ACTION SCENES SEEM TO BE MORE IMPACTFUL IN A VISUAL FORMAT THAN AS WORDS ON A PAGE AND I'M SAYING THIS AS SOMEONE WHO PREFERS A BOOK TO ITS MOVIE ADAPTATION OF THE TIME
IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I'VE READ THAT BOOK A LEAST TWO YEARS NOW BUT I DEFINITELY REMEMBER ENJOYING IT I THINK IT WAS THE PLOT MORE THAN THE CHARACTERS THAT CAUSED ME TO LIKE IT AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED SEEM WRONG TO US NOW BUT BACK THEN BEEN NORMAL OR EVEN ENCOURAGED I WOULD RECOMMEND READING THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO ALSO BY DUMAS IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT ALREADY GREAT STORY AND THE MAIN CHARACTER IS VERY INTERESTING
TRY CROSS POSTING THIS TO THE HORRORIST SUB THEY ARE GREAT AT STUFF LIKE THIS
I AM SURPRISED THANKS
IT ONLY SOUNDS SNOOTY TO ME WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY'D RATHER READ FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THEN PROCEED TO SAY THAT FICTION IS A WASTE OF TIME THAT SOUNDS CONDESCENDING TO ME SAYING YOU LIKE TO READ FOR PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU ENJOY SOUNDS PERFECTLY REASONABLE THE ONLY THING THAT HONESTLY BUGS ME IS WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME THAT WHAT I READ IS A WASTE OF TIME
YOU COULD JUST SAY THAT YOU WANT TO BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME BECAUSE OF YOUR COURSE I THINK THAT'S A FAIRLY REASONABLE EXCUSE
I THINK YOU SAY BASICALLY WHAT YOU SAID HERE JUST BE DIRECT AND DON'T OVER EXPLAIN YOURSELF SOMETHING LIKE I LOVE TO READ BUT I MOSTLY STICK WITH NONFICTION IS ENOUGH UNLESS YOU ARE PUSHED FOR EXPLANATION
DO YOU WATCH MOVIES
JUST TALK ABOUT IT LIKE YOU WOULD FICTION NO ONE GOES AROUND SAYING I ONLY READ FICTION IT SOUNDS WEIRD INSTEAD SAY YOU'RE REALLY INTO BIOGRAPHIES OR HISTORY OR ENGINEERING OR WHATEVER
I USED TO THINK THIS TOO FOR A VERY SIMILAR REASON BASED ON MY FIELD OF STUDY IT WASN'T UNTIL I HAD A REALLY ENLIGHTENING LITERATURE PROFESSOR WHO HAD US REALLY DISCUSS THE THEMES AND IDEAS IN LITERAL WE WERE READING THE METAMORPHOSIS BY FRANZ KAFKA AND WE TOOK AN ALMOST PHILOSOPHICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LOOK AT IT IT WAS A GREAT WAY TO LEARN ABOUT THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE OF FEELING EXILED IN YOUR OWN HOME OR NEGATIVE PERSONAL CHANGES

FIRSTLY YOU ARE HAVING A SOMEWHAT CONDESCENDING AND ARROGANT THOUGHT WHICH IS WHY YOU KNOW YOU COME OFF AS SUCH THE ARROGANCE IS THINKING THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE LEARNED FROM FICTION YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN WHAT CAN BE GAINED FROM FICTION AND WHEN YOU KNOW THIS IT WILL BE BELIEVED THEN YOU WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE IN TALKING ABOUT THIS IT'S OK TO LIKE OR EVEN PREFER BUT TRY TO HONESTLY APPRECIATE FICTION AS MORE THAN JUST MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT

IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TO READ BOOKS FOR PLEASURE AND EVEN PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE NOT RELATED TO SCHOOL WORK
THEN YOU HAVE THE TIME TO READ FICTION BOOKS I THINK YOU MAY HAVE CONVINCED YOURSELF THAT THERE IS NOT MUCH TO BE GAINED FROM FICTION BUT THERE REALLY IS

NOW ON COMMUNICATION THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE FICTION WILL HELP IT IS SO MUCH ABOUT HUMAN EXPERIENCE THAT READING FICTION MAY IMPROVE YOUR INTERPERSONAL SKILLS UNDERSTANDING OF OTHERS UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE AND EVEN COMMUNICATION SKILLS YOU HAVE TO BE MORE HUMAN AND LESS ACADEMIC PERHAPS

ON ACTUALLY SAYING IT
I THINK IF YOU SAY IT IN A POSITIVE HAPPY CASUAL PERSONAL PROPERLY TONED WAY THAT IT WILL NOT SOUND CONDESCENDING IT IS POSSIBLE TO LEARN THINGS FROM FICTION AS WELL ESPECIALLY ABOUT HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND LIFE BUT ALSO HISTORY AND SCIENCE AS BOOKS CAN HAVE FACTS IN THEM
I REALLY ENJOY READING BOOKS IT'S A BIG PART OF MY FIELD OF STUDY BUT I ALSO DO IT FOR PLEASURE AND I REALLY ENJOY LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT TOPICS

EDIT IT'S HARD TO FAKE BEING GENUINE WHICH IS SORT OF WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO THAT IS SORT OF ARROGANT AND CONDESCENDING LEARN THAT FICTION AND ARE DIFFERENT BUT EQUAL THINKING ONE IS BETTER IS ARROGANT

I AM NOT TRYING TO SAY YOU ARE A BAD PERSON AND I THINK IT IS THOUGHTFUL TO NOT WANT TO SEEM ARROGANT BUT IT COMES FROM THOUGHT POSITIVE THOUGHTS POSITIVE PEOPLE
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS THE SAME AS YOU IT ISN'T A PROBLEM IT JUST MEANS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT NOVELS ME OR POLITICAL SCIENCE BOOKS HIM
HOW IS THAT EVEN SNOOTY PERSONALLY I LOOK DOWN ON PEOPLE WHO READ ONLY NONFICTION K BUT IF YOU'VE HAD NEGATIVE REACTIONS WHEN SAYING THIS THEN MAYBE IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE SAYING IT DUDE
I THINK JUST SAYING I'M REALLY INTO WHAT I TEND TO ALMOST ALWAYS READ IS ALL YOU NEED TO SAY THE ONLY WAY THIS GETS WEIRD IS WHEN PEOPLE THEN GO ON TO TALK ABOUT FICTION AS IF IT IS INFERIOR OR AS IF YOU CANNOT LEARN REAL THINGS FROM IT I DON'T THINK IT'S SNOOTY TO SAY YOU READ NONFICTION BECAUSE I DON'T SEE NONFICTION AS SUPERIOR TO FICTION FWIW I'D SAY I READ FICTION NONFICTION
I THINK IT'S THAT THERE'S A CORRELATION IN YOUR FIELD BETWEEN VOCABULARY CHOICES IN READING AND ARROGANCE I'M REFFO NOT SAYING YOU I REALIZE THAT COULD COME OFF THE WRONG WAY I'VE JUST RUN INTO SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE OOOO PRETENTIOUS ABOUT LITERATURE I GUESS I'D SAY MY TIP IS TO NOT SAY I ONLY READ INSTEAD JUST MENTION YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS AND ITS UP TO WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO TO KNOW THEY'RE NOTHING WRONG WITH LIKING WHAT YOU LIKE



MY OTHER COMMENT IS I REALLY HOPE FOUNDATION BY ISAAC ASIMOV IS ON THAT LIST OF FICTION CLASSICS OF YOURS
FIRST I THINK YOU ARE OVER ESTIMATING HOW CONDESCENDING YOUR PREFERENCE SOUNDS ANYONE YOU ARE HAVING A RELEVANT LITERATURE CONVERSATION WITH WILL UNDERSTAND BUT FOR YOUR PEACE OF MIND JUST EXPRESS THAT YOU ENJOY LEARNING AND ARE STRAPPED FOR TIME SO NON FICTION SUITS YOU
JUST SAY THAT REAL LIFE IS FULL OF REALLY COOL ENGAGING STORIES TOO MAYBE YOU FIND THE FACT THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO BE FASCINATING THERE ARE TONS OF PEOPLE AND EVENTS THROUGHOUT HISTORY THAT PLAYED OUT LIKE A REALLY GOOD NOVEL
BOOK PEOPLE ARE FUNNY I KNOW PLENTY OF FICTION READERS THAT LOOK DOWN ON AS AN INFERIOR ART FORM IT REQUIRES MUCH LESS OF A READER THAN FICTION IN THE NEW WORLD OF RAMPANT ANTI INTELLECTUALISM JUST MENTIONING THAT YOU READ AT ALL SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH TO HAVE PEOPLE CONSIDER YOU PRETENTIOUS SO I SAY FUCK EM DON'T BE AFRAID TO DO YOU I PREFER STOUTS AND LAGERS OVER ALES NO HARM DONE BEER IS BEER MY FRIEND SO SIDLE UP TO THE BAR
WELL I THINK IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOU'RE APPROACHING THIS ISSUE LIKE WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID THERE'S NO NEED TO JUSTIFY OR RATHER THERE IS NO NEED TO BE DEFENSIVE ABOUT YOUR READING PREFERENCES I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A REALLY DIFFERENT READING PREFERENCE THAN I DO SHE ENJOYS READING TO WHICH I DO SHARE SIMILAR INTEREST IN HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO FICTION SHE ENJOYS HER CLASSICAL LITERATURE WHEREAS I'M MORE OF A FANTASY BUFF AND I KNOW SHE HAS NO INTEREST IN THAT WHATSOEVER AND TO AN EXTENT ALL OTHER GENRES OF FICTION THAT I ENJOY READING NEVERTHELESS I'VE NEVER SEEN HER AS BEING A SNOB FOR ONLY READING THE CLASSICS NOR DOES SHE ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY WHY SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO READ FANTASY OR ANY OTHER GENRES BASICALLY IN A NUTSHELL I BELIEVE THAT AS LONG AS YOU TELL OTHERS HOW MUCH YOU ENJOY YOUR SUBJECT MATTER BE IT FICTION OR I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULD FURTHER JUSTIFY WHY YOU DON'T READ CERTAIN TYPES OF BOOKS IT BECOMES CONDESCENDING WHEN YOU TURN YOUR NOSE AND BELITTLE OTHERS FOR READING ENJOYING CONTENT THAT YOU DON'T BUT SINCE YOU'VE ESTABLISHED THAT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT IS PROBLEMATIC

I SUPPOSE WHAT I CAN SUGGEST SINCE SOMETIMES EVEN THE MOST WELL MEANING COMMENTS CAN BE MISCONSTRUED IS THAT RATHER THAN SAYING I PREFER READING BE MORE SPECIFIC IS AN EXTREMELY GENERALISED GENRE AND SO MANY COULD BE PLACED UNDER THERE IF YOU SPECIFY YOUR AREA OF INTEREST IT COULD GIVE PEOPLE MORE CONTEXT FOR INSTANCE SAYING OH I'M REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT ANCIENT CIVILISATIONS SO I ENJOY READING BOOKS ABOUT THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY QUESTION SOMEONE FOR HAVING AN INTEREST ON A PARTICULAR SUBJECT
WHY ARE YOU POINTING IT OUT
I'M NOT REALLY INTO FICTION

SOUNDS ALRIGHT TO ME
SAYING I'M NOT INTO FICTION I PREFER TO READ AND LEARN ABOUT NEW THINGS FOR ENJOYMENT
IF YOU TELL PEOPLE YOU ARE MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN AND THEY ARE JUDGING YOU BASED ON THIS ITS NOT YOU WHO WILL BE THE CONDESCENDING ONE
IN MY EXPERIENCE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF WHAT YOU READ ARE THE PRETENTIOUS ONES ENJOYING NONFICTION IS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF NOT EVERYONE HAS THE TEMPERAMENT TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF NONFICTION MORE POWER TO YOU

BUT IN MY OPINION A BOOK CAN ONLY BE PROPERLY VETTED AFTER YOU'VE GIVEN IT A TRY I'VE BEEN SURPRISED BY BOOKS I EXPECTED TO HATE
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A WAY PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THERE IS LITTLE WORTH IN FICTION ARE ARROGANT AND FOOLS WHO ARE LIMITED IN THEIR WORLD VIEW TO THE POINT OF STUPIDITY

THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF FACTS AND MANY KINDS OF TRUTHS NOT ALL OF THESE CAN BE FOUND IN A FACTUAL BOOK ABOUT YOUR GIVEN SUBJECT
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT CONSIDERING THE POINTS OF CONTENTION IN MANY FIELDS OF STUDY HISTORY ARCHITECTURE ECONOMICS ETC YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE READING FICTION ANYWAY THAT IS UNLESS YOU ENJOY READING PURE MATHEMATICAL PROOFS
DON'T SAY I ONLY READ BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO PASS YOUR FICTION RECOMMENDATION ON TO MY BUTLER
WHY SPECIFY WHAT CATEGORY YOU READ AT ALL IF YOU DO SPECIFY THAT YOU READ BUT ONLY IT IS GOING TO COME OFF SNOOTY BECAUSE IT KIND OF IS IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU WHAT YOU ARE READING TELL THEM IF THEY ASK YOU WHETHER YOU HAVE READ X Y OR Z THEN TELL THEM WHETHER YOU HAVE OR NOT

I WILL TELL YOU THAT ONCE YOU ARE ACTUALLY WORKING IN YOUR FIELD YOU WILL START RUNNING OUT OF NON FICTION BOOKS YOU FIND INTERESTING I BLEW THROUGH PRETTY MUCH ALL THE IMPORTANT BOOKS IN MY FIELD IN ABOUT YEARS MORE COME OUT BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO REALIZE THAT THEY HAD LITTLE TO NO NEW INFORMATION IN THEM

AND THEN YOU WILL REALIZE YOU NEED DIVERSIONS FROM YOUR FIELD I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH YOU LOVE YOUR FIELD DO IT FOR YEARS DAY IN DAY OUT AND YOU ARE GOING TO GET BORED WITH IT


THERE'S NO NEED TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF IF SOMEONE NOTICES THIS AND ASKS YOU WHY YOU AVOID FICTION YOU CAN JUST SHRUG AND SAY SOMETHING LIKE HAHA YEAH READING FOR WORK TAKES UP A LOT OF TIME
I LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD I READ BOOKS TO GO TO OTHER WORLDS
I'M PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT SAME WAY I REALLY LIKE LEARNING SOMETHING OR GETTING A MORE INADEPT UNDERSTANDING OF CERTAIN TOPICS BY READING AND FELT THAT WAS THE BEST USE OF MY READING TIME I ACTUALLY HADN'T REALLY PICKED UP A FICTION BOOK IN A FEW YEARS EVEN THOUGH WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND AS A TEENAGER I READ FICTION ALL THE TIME AS AN ADULT AT SOME POINT I WAS GETTING BURNT OUT BY UNIVERSITY CONSTANTLY ABSORBING TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND GAVE SCIENCE FICTION A GO I ENDED UP REALLY LIKING IT AND THIS YEAR I'VE BEEN PRETTY SPLIT WITH SCIENCE FICTION READING WITH A FEW OTHER GENRES OF FICTION HERE AND THERE AFTER SIMILAR VETTING PRACTICES

ANYWAY AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY CONDESCENDING ABOUT IT IT SHOULDN'T REALLY BE THAT CONDESCENDING JUST FOREGO THE EXPLANATION ABOUT IT BEING AN OPTIMAL USE OF YOUR TIME I REALLY LIKE OR WHATEVER SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT

EDIT A WORD
BE SELF DEPRECATING I HAVE A BAD HABIT OF ONLY READING SOMEHOW I JUST CAN'T LEAVE THE LIBRARY WITHOUT A NEW TO READ

WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S TRUE IS IMMATERIAL BUT IT'S WHAT I SAY EVEN THOUGH MY PROBLEM IS THE OPPOSITE WHERE I'M ALWAYS IN THE FICTION AREA
I TELL PEOPLE THAT I NEED TO AVOID FICTION BECAUSE I GET SUCKED INTO THE STORY AND IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO GET BACK TO MY OWN LIFE AGAIN FUNNY THING THE FICTION READERS GET IT AND UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF GETTING SUCKED IN THEY WILL NOD IN AGREEMENT AND THEN GO OFF ON THE LAST TIME THAT HAPPENED TO THEM AND YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU THINK IT SOUNDS SNOOTY RUDE OR CONDESCENDING TO ME IT JUST SOUNDS IGNORANT AS IF YOU DID NOT EVEN APPRECIATE THE SPIRITUAL VALUE OF FICTION

CONSIDERING WHAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOU COULD JUST SAY I WISH I HAD MORE TIME TO READ FICTION AS ALL MY TIME IS TAKEN READING FOR MY PROFESSION
AS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN THE HUMANITIES SOCIAL SCIENCES YOUR SITUATION SOUNDS A LOT LIKE MINE IF THE CONVERSATION EVER VENTURES TO THIS TOPIC I JUST SAY MOSTLY TRUTHFULLY THAT I'VE BEEN RUINED FOR READING FICTION AND I NO LONGER HAVE THE SENSIBILITY NECESSARY TO APPRECIATE IT I WAS ONCE A FICTION READER BUT NOW I FIND MYSELF NO LONGER SEEING THE VALUE IN IT WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO VALUE BUT THAT I DON'T APPRECIATE IT AS I SHOULD AND THAT'S TOTALLY MY FAULT

THIS IS KIND OF A NEGATIVE DIRECTION TO TURN A CONVERSATION SO BE AWARE OF THAT AND THAT AS U CYN SAYS IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO FOCUS ON WHY YOU WANT TO READ WHAT YOU DO READ
YOU CAN REFER TO THE MOVIES FOR THIS ONE JUST LIKEN IT TO PREFERRING DOCUMENTARIES ABOVE ALL ELSE
IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING LANGUAGE SKILLS WHICH CAN BE GOOD FOR COMMUNICATION AND BRAINSTORMING IDEAS SUPPOSEDLY IT BUILDS EMPATHY SINCE T GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO SEE INTO OTHERS MINDS AND HEARTS AND DEPENDING ON HOW CRITICALLY YOU READ IT MIGHT SHARPEN YOUR WITS TOO

TWELVE HOURS A DAY SOUNDS LIKE A LOT THOUGH THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO BUILD EMOTIONAL AND LINGUISTIC INTELLIGENCE AND THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE LOGIC CREATIVITY ETC FOR WHICH READING ALONE WON'T DO MUCH
IT'S CREATIVELY DEMANDING YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE UP A MINDSCAPE AS YOU READ THIS INVOLVES YOUR BRAIN A LOT MORE THAN SAY WATCHING TV WHERE THE ENVIRONMENT YOU'RE OBSERVING HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE FOR YOU
ADAMIK STUDIES SHOW EARLY READING IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ADULT INTELLIGENCE

MY EXPERIENCE ANECDOTAL YES IS THAT PEOPLE WHO READ ARE SMARTER OR

I KNOW YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT QUIT THE FALSE HUMILITY
I'M READING CLASSIC NOVELS ABOUT MURDER AND AFFAIRS THAT ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN THE SOAP OPERAS MY MOM WATCHES

DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU VIEW AS A CLASSIC NOVEL BUT THE BEST OF CLASSIC FICTION SHOULD BE VERY SOAP OPERAS WHY GOOD WRITING SHOULD EASILY SURPASS SOAP OPERAS IN TERMS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL REALISM AND INSIGHT SUBTLETY THEMATIC COMPOSITION LITERARY DEVICES METAPHOR PARTICULARLY TRANSMISSION OF CONTENT ALONG WITH THE BASIC STORY LINGUISTIC RICHNESS AND BEAUTY AND OTHER FEATURES

I'M NO MORE WELL ROUNDED AS I WOULD BE IF I JUST WATCHED GOOD MOVIES OR PLAYED THROUGH THE STORY OF GOOD VIDEO GAMES

IF ALL THREE FORMS ARE EQUALLY ROUNDING THEN YOU'RE RIGHT BUT HISTORICALLY MOVIES AND GAMES HAVE NOT HAD THE TRADITION OF BEING AS MENTALLY ENRICHING AS BOOKS DESCRIBED AS LITERATURE

I WORRY THAT I MISS SOME MAJOR PIECES OF THESE STORIES IF I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF WISER THAN I WAS BEFORE BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE EFFECT IT HAS ON OTHERS

IT'S LIKE WORKING DON'T GET BIGGER STRONGER PERCEPTIBLY AFTER EACH WORKOUT IT'S CUMULATIVE BY READING GOOD WRITERS YOU ARE GRADUALLY EXPOSING YOURSELF TO MANY CULTURAL PATTERNS AND CAUSING YOUR BRAIN TO RUN THOSE PATTERNS WHICH CHANGES IT THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF DOING THINGS LIKE NOT TAKING THE WORLD AT FACE VALUE REALIZING THINGS ARE OFTEN MORE COMPLEX THAN A NAIVE PERSON MIGHT THINK AND GENERALLY NOT RESORTING TO SIMPLISTIC BLACK AND WHITE THINKING

THE MOST I COULD SEE IS THAT READING GIVES YOU A WIDER VOCABULARY BUT I DON'T OFTEN FIND MYSELF USING ANY BIGGER WORDS THAN PEOPLE AROUND ME

SEE ABOVE FOR MY REFUTATION OF THE MOST RE VOCABULARY YOU SHOULDN'T OFTEN FIND YOURSELF USING BIGGER WORDS THAN THOSE AROUND YOU FOR THREE REASONS MANY SUCH WORDS ARE LIKE ADD A LITTLE AT THE RIGHT TIME BUT YOU STILL WANT TO HAVE THAT DIJON MUSTARD FOR THOSE MOMENTS AND 2 IT'S GOOD TO MATCH THOSE AROUND YOU OR AT LEAST USE YOUR VOCABULARY JUDICIOUSLY UNLESS YOU WANT TO ALIENATE THEM IT'S GENERALLY MORE NATURAL TO USE SUCH VOCABULARY WORDS IN WRITING MORE OFTEN THAN SPEAKING UNLESS YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL SPEAKER OR NOTED WIT RACONTEUR

EVEN WITH NONFICTION OR HISTORICAL FICTION THE THINGS YOU LEARN ARE INCREDIBLY NUANCED ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC TOPIC AND NEVER COME UP IN ACTUAL CONVERSATION OR EVEN ON JEOPARDY

THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT ALWAYS TRUE IN ALMOST ALL CASES READING A BOOK ON A TOPIC WILL GIVE THE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THAT TOPIC IN ADDITION TO THE MORE NUANCED OR MINISCULE DETAILS IN FACT IT WILL LIKELY REPEATEDLY PRESENT THE BASIC INFORMATION TO THE READER BY NECESSITY THEREBY CEMENTING THAT BASIC INFORMATION IN THE MEMORY ALMOST ANY HISTORY BOOK ON WORLD WAR II WILL CONTINUALLY REFERENCE AT LEAST SOME OF ROOSEVELT CHURCHILL HITLER STALIN EVENTS OF THE LATE AND EARLY THE SITUATION IN GERMANY AND FRANCE THE MANHATTAN PROJECT EINSTEIN TOJO HIROHITO MUSSOLINI ET AL AND ETC AS IT ADVANCES THE BOOK ALONG THE WAY ALL THAT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE FAMILIAR TO YOU CUT TO YEARS LATER AT A COCKTAIL PARTY AND SOMEONE BRINGS UP THE WAR NOW YOU'RE NOT AS LOST AS MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS IT FEELS OBVIOUS TO YOU THAT WWII TOOK PLACE IN THE AND INVOLVED EUROPE U SOUTH AND JAPAN ETC KEEP IN MIND MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE NO IDEA OF ANY OF THAT SADLY

THESE THINGS ALSO DON'T COME UP IN CONVERSATIONS IF YOU ONLY HAVE REALLY LIMITED CONVERSATIONS BUT THAT IS NOT THE ONLY KIND YOU CAN HAVE BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE EQUALLY WELL READ

FINALLY KEEP IN MIND INTELLIGENCE IS NOT JUST KNOWLEDGE OR BEING WELL-ROUNDED IN FACT THAT'S MAYBE THE LEAST OF IT IT'S PROBLEM SOLVING PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ANALYSIS EMOTIONAL PROCESSING AESTHETIC PROCESSING PROPORTION DETECTION SHORT AND MEMORY CREATIVITY PENETRATIVITY VERBAL COMMAND INTEGRATION OF COMPLEXITY ETC GOOD WRITING CAN ACCELERATE ALL THAT IT'S NOT THE ONLY STIMULI THAT CAN DO IT THOUGH I'D ARGUE THAT OTHER PEOPLE NATURE MATH WORKING WITH OBJECTS AND INTELLIGENT MUSIC DANCE VISUAL ARTS MARTIAL ARTS FILM AND OTHER MEDIA CAN DO IT TOO BUT READING IS A PARTICULARLY AMENABLE FORM TO ONE'S MIND
BOOKS ARE ACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TV IS PASSIVE

YOU HAVE TO ACTIVELY PUT IN EFFORT TO GET ENJOYMENT OUT OF BOOKS WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING TO GET ENJOYMENT OUT OF TV OR MOVIES YES THE BETTER MOVIES AND BETTER SHOWS PUT IN ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT ACTIVE BUT THEY ARE GENERALLY HARDER TO FIND THAN A BOOK THAT DOES THE SAME
IT'S PROBABLY A HISTORICAL THROWBACK THAT STILL PLAYS INTO MODERN PERCEPTION BACK WHEN LITERACY RATES WERE LOWER BEING ABLE TO READ WAS SOMEWHAT A STATUS SYMBOL AND A SIGN OF A HIGH EDUCATION
I DON'T KNOW I KNOW THAT I READ BECAUSE I AM DUMB
TO ME IT IS A VERY ACTIVE HOBBY AND I KNOW THAT SEEMS WEIRD WHILE ON THE SURFACE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES OR WATCHING TV SEEMS TO HAVE THE SAME EFFECT OF STORY TELLING AS READING THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AND WATCH A MOVIE OR SHOW IT HAPPENS TO YOU YOU PASSIVELY EXPERIENCE IT I KNOW IT SEEMS THAT PLAYING VIDEO GAMES IS NOT PASSIVE BUT I'LL TOUCH ON THAT LATER

BUT WITH READING NOTHING IS HAPPENING TO YOU ALL THE STIMULATION COMES FROM YOURSELF WE HAVE TO ACTIVELY CHOOSE TO ENGAGE OUR BRAINS IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T SEE WITH OTHER MEDIA LIKE VIDEO GAMES YES WE GET TO MAKE CHOICES WITH VIDEO GAMES BUT THE EXPERIENCE IS POWERED BY EXTERNAL STIMULATION WE HAVE TO POWER OUR OWN EXPERIENCE WHEN WE READ AND I THINK THAT ITSELF ATTRACTS CERTAIN TYPES OF BRAINS

ON TOP OF THAT THESE DAYS WE NEED TO CHOOSE LACK OF EXTERNAL STIMULATION OVER STIMULATION IN ORDER TO BE DRAWN TO READING IN THE SAME WAY THAT MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT A FEW MINUTES IF MEDITATION IS GOOD FOR THE BRAIN BUT AVOID DOING IT IN FAVOUR OF BEING STIMULATED STIMULATION IS ADDICTIVE AND MOST PEOPLE GIVE IN TO THAT IT IS EASY TO SIT BACK AND WATCH TV BUT YOU HAVE TO WANT TO READ IN ORDER TO READ

EVEN FOR ME I STRUGGLE TO FIGHT THE URGE TO PUT ON A MOVIE REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT I KNOW I WILL ENJOY READING MORE I THINK THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO ENGAGE OUR BRAIN COMES ALONG WITH THE DESIRE FOR MENTAL EXPLORATION THAT COMES WITH INTELLIGENCE LEARNING SOMETHING CAN BE DRIVEN BY CLASSES OR TUTORIALS BUT ACTUAL LEARNING TAKES PLACE INSIDE OUR OWN BRAINS INTELLIGENT PEOPLE SEEM TO CONSISTENTLY CHOOSE LEARNING AND I WOULD SAY IN A BROAD SENSE THAT DRIVE FOR LEARNING AND INTERNAL STIMULATION IS INTELLIGENCE

THAT BEING SAID I KNOW LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SMART AND HAVE PHS AND WHO DON'T READ THEY SEEM ODDLY PROUD OF IT TOO BUT I DON'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE I PERCEIVE AS DUMB WHO READ I DO KNOW LOTS OF LESS INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO AUDIO BOOKS AND I THINK THAT IS A SIMILAR ARGUMENT BUT I DON'T NEED TO GET INTO THAT




LITERACY CHANGES THE WAY YOU THINK WRITING THINGS DOWN FORCES A CLARITY AND ORGANIZATION OF THOUGHT THAT THE EPHEMERAL SPOKEN WORD DOES NOT WHEN YOU READ A LOT YOU'RE EXPOSING YOURSELF TO THIS WAY OF THINKING ON A REGULAR BASIS AND IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU ORGANIZE AND FORMAT YOUR OWN THOUGHTS

THE HUMAN BRAIN CAN HOLD ABOUT ITEMS IN ITS SHORT TERM MEMORY AT ONCE FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S A FEW MORE FOR OTHERS IT'S A FEW LESS WHEN YOU USE WRITTEN SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THOUGHT THAT NUMBER EXPLODES AND YOU CAN LATER USE THOSE SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATIONS TO AID YOUR SHORT TERM MEMORY FOR EXAMPLE WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO COUNT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AND OF SOMETHING IS HARD TO REASON ABOUT BUT ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND NUMBERS AND HAVE CONCEPTS OF THOSE SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATIONS MEMORIZED YOU CAN REASON ABOUT THAT WITH NO DIFFICULTY NOW EXTRAPOLATE THAT TO MORE DEEP CONCEPTS AT HIGH READING LEVELS A SINGLE WORD CAN CONVEY AS MUCH MEANING AND NUANCE AS SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS OF LESS GOOD WRITING IF YOU'RE READING CLASSIC NOVELS YOU'RE GETTING INSIGHT INTO THE HUMAN CONDITION THAT YOUR MOM IS ABSOLUTELY NOT GETTING FROM HER SOAP OPERAS
BECAUSE SMART PEOPLE LIKE BOOKS BOOKS MAKE YOU SMART THE SAME WAY SWEAT PANTS MAKE YOU FAT READING DOESN'T MAKE YOU SMARTER
READING INVOLVES PATIENCE CONCENTRATION COMPLETE FOCUS A STRONG VOCABULARY STRONG COMPREHENSION FOR COMPLEX NARRATIVES THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THEMES AND SYMBOLISM THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY WITH THE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN AND A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER THINGS

TL R READING IS STRONGLY RELATED TO INTELLIGENCE WORK ETHIC AND OTHER REDEEMING TRAITS AND OP IS NOT AS SMART AS HIS HER PARENTS SAY
THIS IS PRECISELY THE STEREOTYPE THAT INTIMIDATES NEW READERS IN MY EXPERIENCE ANYWAY I'VE TRIED TO ENCOURAGE MY SIBLINGS AND FRIENDS TO READ EVEN SUGGESTED BOOKS THAT I'M SURE WOULD INTEREST THEM BUT NO THEY ALL THINK YOU NEED BUDDHIST MONK LIKE CONCENTRATION AND A HIGH IQ TO GET THROUGH BOOKS COULDN'T BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH
AS FAR AS INTELLIGENCE GOES I'M NOT MUCH BETTER OFF THAN SOMEONE WHO WATCHES TV OR PLAYS VIDEO GAMES AS ENTERTAINMENT MAYBE MY VOCABULARY IS BROADER AND I MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT MY THOUGHTS ON PAPER MORE EASILY BUT OTHER THAN THAT THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE HOWEVER READING GOES FAR BEYOND MERE INTELLIGENCE WHEN YOU READ YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF INTO DIFFERENT SITUATIONS ONES YOU MAY NEVER EXPERIENCE OTHERWISE WHEN YOU READ YOU FIND YOURSELF THINKING OF THE WORLD AND THE PEOPLE IN IT IN WAYS YOU'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF BEFORE TV CAN GIVE YOU SOME OF THE SAME OUTCOMES BUT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO CONNECT AS EMOTIONALLY AS YOU WOULD A BOOK A BOOK TAKES LONGER TO READ HAS MORE DETAIL AND INSIGHT INTO A CHARACTER ETC ALL IN ALL NEARLY ALL FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT HAVE THEIR BENEFITS AND WE SHOULD NEVER ASSUME THAT SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T READ IS DUMB OR SOMEONE WHO CONSTANTLY READS IS A GENIUS WE ALL TAKE AWAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND BECOME BETTER PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT WAYS
THE WHOLE READERS ARE SMARTER THAN THE REST OF US IDEA REALLY ISN'T TRUE I THINK THERE ARE MASSES OF REALLY SMART PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO FOR WHATEVER REASONS AREN'T SPENDING ANY OF THEIR FREE TIME READING

WHEN PEOPLE THROW THAT YOU MUST BE REALLY SMART THING IN MY FACE IT ALWAYS STRIKES ME AS A RATHER JUVENILE ACCUSATION A CRITICISM FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE SOMEHOW INTIMIDATED BY THE IDEA OF FORMAL EDUCATION

I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED YOU SHOULD STRIVE BEYOND WHATEVER YOU BELIEVE YOUR ACADEMIC POTENTIAL MIGHT BE JUST IN CASE THE BULLIES IN SCHOOL WERE TOTALLY WRONG AND YOU AMAZE YOURSELF BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T SHARE THAT THOUGHT
I DEFINITELY THINK READING IMPROVES MY VOCABULARY ESPECIALLY IF IT'S IN CONJUNCTION WITH WORKING ON MY VOCABULARY OUTSIDE OF READING I STILL GO OOOH VOCAB WORD WHEN I READ ONE OF MY VOCAB WORDS MY SISTER WAS A VORACIOUS READER AS A KID AND STILL IS AND SHE WOULD ROUTINELY MISPRONOUNCE WORDS THAT SHE'D READ IN A BOOK AND PICKED UP ENOUGH CONTEXT TO KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT BUT SHE WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THEM CORRECTLY BECAUSE SHE'D NEVER HEARD ANYONE SAY THEM OUT LOUD

ALTHOUGH I LACK EVIDENCE I SUSPECT THAT READING HAS HELPED MY GRAMMAR TOO I WOULDN'T PRETEND IT WORKS THIS WAY FOR EVERYBODY BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I CAN READ A SENTENCE AND KNOW THAT IT'S WRONG AND HOW TO FIX IMPROVE IT BUT I CAN'T EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT MOST OF THAT I ATTRIBUTE TO READING I'VE READ CORRECT SENTENCES ENOUGH TIMES THAT I CAN PICK UP ON INCORRECT SENTENCES

I ALSO DISAGREE THAT YOU CAN'T BECOME MORE WELL-ROUNDED OR LEARN SOMETHING FROM A WORK OF FICTION I READ ESSENTIALLY ZERO AS A CHILD BUT A BUNCH OF BOOKS I READ WERE BASED ON OR MENTIONED ACTUAL HISTORICAL EVENTS AND I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP A LOT OF RELEVANT USEFUL INFORMATION MY FAVORITE YA SERIES IS FANTASY AND TAUGHT ME NOTHING ABOUT ACTUAL EVENTS BUT I COULD RELATE TO LEARN FROM AND WAS INSPIRED BY THE MAIN CHARACTER BOOKS I'VE READ HAVE PUT PLENTY OF NEW THOUGHTS INTO MY HEAD AND SHAPED THE WAY I PERCEIVE CURRENT POLICIES AND HOW THEY MIGHT IMPACT OUR FUTURE AS FAR AS ADULT BOOKS RIGHT NOW I'M READING CRYPTONOMICON BESIDES TEACHING ME PERSISTENCE SORRY TO ANYONE WHO LIKES THIS BOOK IT'S ONLY BEEN INTERMITTENTLY ENTERTAINING TO ME SO FAR THERE ARE BITS IN THERE ABOUT ALGORITHMS HOW DATA IS RANDOMIZED AND WHAT PEOPLE CAN LEARN FROM BOTH IMPERFECTLY RANDOMIZED DATA AND PERFECTLY RANDOMIZED DATA NO I'M NOT GOING TO BECOME A HACKER TOMORROW AND YES IT'S A RANDOM THING TO KNOW JUST A TINY OUTDATED BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT BUT I DEFINITELY THINK MY HORIZONS ARE JUST A SMIDGEN WIDER TODAY THAN THEY WERE TWO WEEKS AGO THANKS TO READING THIS ONE BOOK

NOW IF YOU WANT TO ARGUE THAT YOU CAN BECOME JUST AS WELL-ROUNDED AND LEARN JUST AS MUCH FROM WATCHING THINGS AS READING I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT YOU CAN LEARN PLENTY OF HISTORY AND FEAR PLENTY OF DYSTOPIAN FUTURES AND FIND PLENTY OF CHARACTERS TO EMULATE AND ABSORB PLENTY OF RANDOM FACTORIES FROM SHOWS I GUESS IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DO PEOPLE LEARN FEAR EMULATE ABSORB WHEN THEY WATCH SHOWS OR ARE MOST PEOPLE LIKE ME AND THEY JUST WANT TO ZONE OUT AND WATCH SOMEONE DRAMA UNFOLD FOR A WHILE SO THEY CAN FORGET THEIR OWN NOT THAT YOU CAN'T READ BOOKS FOR THEIR VALUE TOO THOUGH
IN TERMS OF ENTERTAINMENT BOOKS ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN MOVIES TV SERIES GAMES OR PODCASTS HELL I WOULD ARGUE THAT OTHER MEDIUM PROVE TO BE MORE ENTERTAINING FOR MOST PEOPLE

BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GAINING NEW INFORMATION NOTHING COMES CLOSE TO THE BANDWIDTH OF INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN GET VIA READING LECTURES TALKING TO PEOPLE LISTENING ARE FAR SLOWER AT TRANSFERRING NEW INFO TO YOUR HEAD

READING DOESN'T INHERENTLY MAKES YOU SMARTER IT'S THE EASE WITH WHICH NEW INFO CAN BE GAINED THAT MAKES YOU MATER



AS YOU SAID ITS AN ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATIONS ARE ROOTED IN BOTH FACT AND ABSURDITY IN EQUAL MEASURE BUT THOSE WHO READ MORE HAVE OTHER QUALITIES AND HABITS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH INTELLIGENCE
READING BROADENS YOUR HORIZON AND YOU CAN LEARN A LOT ALWAYS DEPENDING ON WHAT KIND OF BOOKS YOU READ OF COURSE
I ALWAYS LIKE TO VIEW READING AS SOME SORT OF MENTAL GYMNASTICS READING REQUIRES HIGHER ORDER THINKING TO PROCESS GRASP THE ABSTRACT CONCEPT EXPERIENCE BEING DELIVERED IN THE TEXT AND THE ABILITY TO PICTURE WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED AS A READER ONE NEEDS TO INTERPRET EVERYTHING PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL MATERIALS BY THEMSELVES FROM SCRATCH ON THE OTHER HAND ALL THE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE ORIGINAL MATERIALS CONCEPTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE WHEN WE'RE WATCHING A FILM OR A TV SHOW TO ME IT'S THE EXTRA PROCESS OF INTERPRETING READERS GO THROUGH THAT MAKES READING A SPECIAL AND REWARDING ACTIVITY
CONSIDER THE FACT THAT OF ADULT AMERICANS CANT READ A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE
READING REQUIRES INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVE TO BE LEARNED AND HAVE A CERTAIN VOCABULARY A MOVIE FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SHOW TO ANYONE WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN READ BUT A BOOK NOT SO MUCH YOU HAVE TO BE EDUCATED
I BELIEVE THAT A PART OF IT IS THAT INTELLIGENT PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT A WORK AND IMMEDIATELY KNOW WHAT IT IS WHEREAS THOSE THAT ARE NOT READERS NEED TO SOUND IT OUT
HE HAS A WAY OF TELLING THE EMOTIONAL TRUTH THAT WILL MAKE THE SEQUENCE OF READING IRRELEVANT IT MIGHT BE MORE LOGICAL TO READ THEM SEQUENTIALLY BUT HE IS A HIGHLY SKILLED NARRATOR AND HE WILL TAKE YOU TO THE HEART OF THE STORY BEFORE YOU KNOW IT
I HAVEN'T READ HOME BUT I AM KIND OF FAMILIAR WITH BOLITA AND COHEN
MOST OF THE TIME HE REPEATS THE ESSENTIAL STUFF HIS FRIEND IS RICH HIS SECRETARY IS AN EX
IT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY FINE I MYSELF PICKED UP A FEW BOLITA BOOKS WITHOUT A SPECIFIC ORDER OR ANYTHING
ONLY THING ILL SAY ABOUT THIS BOOK IS YOU'LL NEED TWO BOOKMARKS
I ENJOYED INFINITE JEST ALTHOUGH I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF IT WENT OVER MY HEAD AND I HAD TO GOOGLE QUITE A LOT BE SURE TO READ THE DEFINITIVE JEST WIKI ALONGSIDE IT AND PERHAPS YOU MIGHT ALSO FIND IT USEFUL TO LOOK AT INFINITESUMMER ALSO
JUST READ THE BOOK EVERY DAY AND DON'T STOP
READ EVERY PAGE AND EVERY FOOTNOTE A FEW YEARS BACK AND IT TOOK OVER MY LIFE FOR ABOUT A MONTH AN EXCELLENT READ WALLACE WAS THE MASTER AT HUMOR WRAPPED IN AN OVERALL SADNESS THE WORLD IS MUCH POORER WITHOUT HIS PRESENCE IT'S A VERY DENSE READ BUT HANG IN THERE
I READ IT WITH REDDIN ON R INFINITESUMMER JUNE TO SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR I KEPT A VERY DETAILED READING JOURNAL THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST IT'S IN SECTIONS MATCHING THE WEEK REDDIN PROJECT
NOPE NOBODY ELSE ESPECIALLY NOT THE ENTIRE SUBREDDITS DEVOTED TO THE BOOK OR THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COMMENTING ON THREADS ABOUT HIM THAT YOU'D HAVE SEEN IF YOU SEARCHED
HOMELESS CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE A THING
R UPLIFTINGNESS
NOT SURE BUT I THINK PEOPLE ASSUMED SHE WAS A TERRIBLE MOTHER BECAUSE OF WHAT HER KID DID I THINK ITS THE SAME REASON THAT A MOTHERS RECKONING THE BOOK BY SUSAN KELBOLD WAS POPULAR PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT CAUSES THESE SHOOTINGS SOME IS MORBID FASCINATION BUT FOR OTHERS ITS ACTUAL CONCERN MAYBE THEIR OWN CHILD OR CLASSMATE IS GOING DOWN A QUESTIONABLE PATHOLOGY PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHEN IT IS SIMPLY A TRENCH COAT BLACK NAIL POLISH AND A LOVE FOR VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES VERSUS AN ACTUAL MURDERER SOME PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE IN BLAMING THE PARENT EVEN THOUGH THAT ISNT ALWAYS THE CASE I THINK ALSO PEOPLE BLAME THE PARENT SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THE PARENT SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THEIR CHILD WAS A LOOSE CANNON AND GOT THEM CHECKED IN TO A PSYCH WARD
PARENTS ARE CONSIDERED RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR KIDS

2 THE ANGRY MOB NEEDS SOMEONE TO BLAME AFTER THE KILLER IS DEAD INCARCERATED

PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT CAUSES THESE INCIDENTS AND PARENTS ARE A REALLY EASY TARGET RIGHT AFTER GUNS AND RELIGION


SHE CONTINUED TO LIVE IN THE SAME SMALL TOWN WHERE THE FAMILY HAD LIVED BEFORE FATEFUL NIGHT THAT MEANT SHE WAS CONSTANTLY BUMPING INTO PEOPLE WHOSE OWN CHILDREN HAD BEEN MURDERED BY HER SON

AFTER ANY KIND OF TRAGEDY A NATURAL HUMAN INSTINCT IS TO FIND SOMEONE TO BLAME IN THE CASE OF A TEENAGED KILLER A PHRASE HEARD IS I BLAME THE PARENTS SO IT'S NOT COMPLETELY SURPRISING THAT SOMEONE GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF THEIR OWN CHILD IN SUCH AWFUL CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HARBOUR ANGER AND RESENTMENT AGAINST THE MOTHER OF THE KILLER ESPECIALLY AS HER OWN SON IS STILL ALIVE ALBEIT LOCKED UP
I'VE ONLY SEEN THE MOVIE BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE HADN'T LIKE PUBLICLY DENOUNCED HIM IF THAT MAKES SENSE SHE GOES TO VISIT HIM AND SEEMS TO STILL CARE ABOUT HIM DESPITE WHAT HE DID

SO I FIGURED IT WAS ONE PART YOU RAISED A MONSTER AND VISIT HIM IN PRISON AND ONE PART WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE AS A CONSTANT REMINDER OF OUR PAIN
THE BOOK IS ALL ABOUT NATURE VS NURTURE AND THE MOTHER'S NARRATIVE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK SHE HAS BEEN HOME ALONE WITH BABY KEVIN AND HE WON'T STOP CRYING SHE ACTUALLY SAYS HE'S DOING IT ON PURPOSE AND THE HUSBAND LOOKS AT HER LIKE SHE LOST HER MIND SO FROM THE START THE MOTHER SON ARE OPPOSING FORCES AND THE WHOLE BOOK IS EXAMINE THEIR INHERENT PERSONS VERSUS LIFE INFLUENCE IT IS HARD TO LIKE A MOTHER WHO COULD BE SO COLD TO HER OWN INFANT EVEN THOUGH SHE LOVES HIM THE FILM DOES A GOOD JOB PORTRAYING A MOTHER WE STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND AND THUS DISLIKE
IM SURE THERE ARE PLENTY OF SIMILAR STORIES IN THE US FROM THE PAST YEARS SPECIALLY WHEN THE KID KILLS HIMSELF AFTER THE SHOOTING THE MOB NEEDS SOMEONE TO BLAME THE FAMILIES OF THOSE LOST NEED SOMEONE TO DIRECT THEIR ANGER TOWARDS AND A DEAD KID SOMETIMES ISN'T ENOUGH PARENTS COULD BE SEEN AS NEGLIGENT BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO SEE THIS COMING AND FAILED TO STOP IT
IN THE MOVIE AND THE BOOK SHE SPENDS NEARLY ALL OF HER MONEY ON DEFENSE ATTORNEYS TO TRY AND GET HIM THE MOST LENIENT SENTENCE POSSIBLE THE PROSECUTION TRIES TO PAINT HER AS A NEGLIGENT MOTHER BUT SHE STICKS AROUND AND FIGHTS FOR HIM AS MUCH AS SHE CAN TO COMBAT THIS SHE FEELS NOTHING FOR HIM EXCEPT A DEEP SENSE OF LOATHING AND ABJECTION BUT FOR THE PUBLIC SHE MUST ALWAYS BE THE PICTURE OF THE PERFECT MOTHER DEFENDING HER SON TO HER DYING BREATH

THE OTHER MOTHERS WHO LOST THEIR CHILDREN AND THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY SEE HER FIGHTING FOR THIS MONSTER WATCH HER STAYING IN TOWN GOING ABOUT HER LIFE WHILE THEIR KIDS CAN NO LONGER LIVE THEIRS A HUGE SURGE OF RESENTMENT AND HATRED WOULD NATURALLY OCCUR WHY SHOULD HER SON GET TO LIVE WHILE THEIR KIDS DO NOT WHY DOES SHE GET TO PROUDLY STRUT AROUND TOWN SHOWING HER FACE AT THE STORE LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED WHILE THEIR WORLD CAME CRASHING DOWN IT'S NOT FAIR

THEY LASH OUT IN THE ONLY WAY THEY KNOW HOW SNEAK ATTACKS ON HER HOME WITH PAINT CRUSHING HER EGGS IN THE STORE ACTUAL SECOND CONFRONTATIONS TO MERELY SLAP HER AND RUN AWAY THEY CAN'T ARTICULATE THE SURGE OF FEELINGS OR ACCEPT THAT SHE TOO IS A VICTIM HER PROUD DEMEANOR TO PROTECT HERSELF ONLY SERVES TO JUSTIFY MORE ATTACKS OBVIOUSLY SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE MURDERED YOUTH SO SHE MUST PAY

HOPE THAT HELPS
THE BOOK IS FROM HER PERSPECTIVE AND IT GIVES A FAIR BIT OF INSIGHT INTO WHY PEOPLE WERE SO QUICK TO BLAME HERALDRY THE TOWN HATES HER BECAUSE THEY CAN SEE THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN HER AND KEVIN

SHE THINKS AND ACTS A LOT LIKE A PSYCHOPATH SHE'S FULLY AWARE THAT SHE IS SUPPOSED TO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT HER FAMILY AND BE OKAY WITH SACRIFICING SOME FREEDOM TO RAISE HER KIDS AND SHE DOES IN FACT DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IN A FUNCTIONAL SOCIETY BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT SHE GETS ABSOLUTELY NO PLEASURE FROM HELPING OTHER PEOPLE

SHE'S A PITIABLE FIGURE IN THAT SENSE MOST PEOPLE AT LEAST GET A ALTRUISTIC HIGH WHEN THEY DO THE RIGHT THING SHE'S MISERABLE NOT JUST DESPITE BUT BECAUSE SHE TRIES TO ACT CORRECTLY WHEN THERE'S NO REWARD AND ULTIMATELY IT DOES HER NO GOOD PEOPLE STILL GET THE SENSE THAT WRONG WITH HER BECAUSE SHE APES EMOTIONS THAT SHE CAN'T FEEL AND THAT SHOWS THROUGH SOONER OR LATER SHE PASSES HER PSYCHOPATHY DOWN TO HER SON SHE CAN'T SCARE HIM WITH FEARS OF OSTRACIZATION OR PUNISHMENT BECAUSE UNLIKE HER HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THOSE CONSEQUENCES AND SHE CAN'T TEACH HIM THAT DECENCY IS IN HIS OWN BECAUSE HE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT IT ISN'T

SERIOUSLY IT'S A DAMN GOOD BOOK AND YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY READ IT
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE AND IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I READ THE BOOK HOWEVER IF I'M REMEMBERING CORRECTLY SHE'S INCREDIBLY AFTER RAMPAGE SHE SPENDS MONEY ON LAWYERS BUT SHE DOESN'T EXPRESS REMORSE FOR WHAT HER SON HAS DONE I THINK A NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST CALLS HER OUT ON HER LACK OF EMOTIONS AND SAYS SOMETHING LIKE SHE'S ACTING LIKE HER SON DIPPED A GIRL'S PIGTAIL IN AN INKWELL NOT LIKE HE KILLED HIS CLASSMATES SOMETHING LIKE THAT

I THINK THE OTHER PARENTS BLAME HER FOR WHAT KEVIN HAS DONE AND FIND HER LACK OF EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO IT OFFENSIVE I THINK THEY'RE LASHING OUT BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK SHE'S REMORSEFUL

THERE'S ALSO A SCENE WHERE THE MOTHER OF A GIRL THAT KEVIN IS BULLYING CONFRONTS HER AND SHE BASICALLY TELLS THE OTHER WOMAN TO SUCK IT UP THE GIRL HAS A HISTORY OF EATING DISORDERS AND BEEN MAKING JABS ABOUT HER WEIGHT THE GIRL'S MOM CONFRONTS MOM AND MOM JUST BRUSHES HER OFF SHE DOESN'T DENY BEHAVIOR SHE DOESN'T APOLOGIZE FOR IT SHE JUST SAYS SUCK IT UP
SHE HAS NO EVIL INTENT HERE BUT SHE DEFINITELY HAS FAILINGS SHE IS NOT A GOOD PERSON

SHE WAS NOT EQUIPPED TO COPE WITH HIM AND WAS ABUSIVE WHICH SEEMS ESSENTIAL TO CREATING THE BROKEN KID HERE
THE BOOK IS FROM HER PERSPECTIVE SHE'S IRRITATING TO READ BECAUSE SHECOMES OFF AS NARCISSISTIC AND VERBOSE SHE'S ALSO CREEPY ANYONE ELSE GET THESE FEELINGS FROM HER
BC SHE WAS BLAMED FOR HER SONS BEHAVIOR
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE COMMENTING DIDN'T READ THE BOOK SHE IS AN UNRELIABLE NARRATOR IF YOU BELIEVE HER FROM HIS VERY CONCEPTION SHE DIDN'T LIKE KEVIN IN REACTION TO HIS BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS AS A YOUNG CHILD SHE BREAKS HIS ARM

IN ONE INCIDENT HER SON SAYS HE WAS MOLESTED AND SHE ASSUMES HE IS LYING AFTER HIS LITTLE SISTERS ACCIDENT AVA IS SURE KEVIN IS RESPONSIBLE DESPITE THE EVIDENCE POINTING TO HIM ACTUALLY SAVING HERALDRY

HER AMBIVALENCE TO KEVIN IS MADE WORSE BECAUSE SHE DOTES ALL OVER HER OTHER CHILD

IN INTERVIEWS KEVIN MAKES FUN OF HIS DAD BUT ABSOLUTELY REFUSES TO SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT HIS MOTHER SHE WAS ALSO THE ONLY PERSON IN THE FAMILY HE DIDN'T KILL SHRIVER CAN EASILY WRITE CHARACTERS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY LOATHSOME
BECAUSE MOTHERS ARE SUPPOSE TO NOTICE THEIR CHILDREN ARE MENTALLY ILL AND GET THEM HELP OR FATHERS
IT'S BEEN ABOUT MONTHS SINCE I SAW THE FILM BUT THE MOTHER WENT ALMOST COMPLETELY BANKRUPT DEFENDING HER SON IN COURT SHE LIVES IN AN OLD HOUSE DRIVES AN OLD CAR AND WORKS AS AN EMPLOYEE AT A TRAVEL AGENCY INSTEAD OF AS THE BOSS THE END REALLY SUGGESTS THAT KEVIN WILL EVENTUALLY GET OUT SINCE HIS MOTHER IS PREPPING HIS ROOM FOR HIM SO HE KILLS AND MAIMS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE TOWN BUT DOESN'T GET LIFE BECAUSE OF HIS MOTHER BUT WHAT'S A MOM TO DO RIGHT

I'VE BEEN READING A LOT OF JOHN DOUGLAS LATELY BEHAVIOR AS A CHILD DOES REFLECT A LOT OF WHAT DOUGLAS SAYS ABOUT SERIAL KILLERS WHEN THEY'RE YOUNGER BATHROOM ISSUES ESCALATING VIOLENCE TOWARDS TOYS AND ANIMALS ALTHOUGH HIS ACTUAL CRIME IS TECHNICALLY A WHICH TIES MORE CLOSELY WITH A LACK OF A SUPPORT STRUCTURE WITH SERIOUS LIFE ISSUES
SHE ISN'T A NICE PERSON SHE'S SELFISH AND CONCEITED I LOATHED HERALDRY SHE WAS A VICTIM BUT SHE ALSO BURIED HERSELF IN THE ROLE AND REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE PROPERLY THAT SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE

SHE ALSO REVEALS SHE FEELS THE ONE THING A PARENT SHOULDN'T EVER FEEL SAY THEY REGRET HAVING A CHILD
PEOPLE SOMETIMES ASSUME THAT OTHERS HAVE THE SAME SECRET URGES AND TRAITS THAT THEY HAVE WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT FUNDAMENTALIST PREACHERS FOR EXAMPLE WHO RAIL AGAINST PROMISCUITY AND THEN GET CAUGHT IN AN AFFAIR COULD IT BE THAT THAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE REALIZE DEEP DOWN THAT THEY ARE DEFICIENT PARENTS AND ASSUME THAT MOTHER IS THE SAME DEEP DOWN THAT'S IT IS HER FAULT
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I SAW THE MOVIE BUT I REMEMBER SHE TRIED TO HAVE A NICE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER SON SHE WAS NEVER THE PERFECT MOTHER BUT SHE AT LEAST TRIED KEVIN SHOWED SIGNS OF PSYCHOPATHY AND OTHER DISTURBS SINCE EARLY AGE AND SHE REACTED THE WAY MOST PARENTS WOULD DENIAL AFTER ALL WHICH MOTHER WOULD ACCEPT EASILY THAT THE CHILD SHE GAVE BIRTH TO MIGHT BE A MONSTER I MEAN IF IT WAS ME IN HER PLACE I WOULD HAVE INTERVENED WAY BEFORE THAT WHOLE MESS HAD THE CHANCE TO HAPPEN IN THE MOMENT HE KILLED HIS PET TO BE EXACTLY BUT THIS IS ME MOST PARENTS WOULDN'T FATHER BLINDNESS WAS EVEN WORSE COMING TO THE POINT OF GIVING HIS SON A BOW
I COULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THIS MOVIE THE FIRST HALF WAS TOO SLOW FOR ME
THE MOVIE WAS OK LOVED THE BOOK IF YOU LOOK AT REAL LIFE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THE PARENTS ARE HATED AND BLAMED FOR THE ACTIONS OF THEIR CHILDREN READ A MOTHER'S RECKONING IT'S BY THE MOTHER OF ONE OF THE COLUMBINE SHOOTERS IT'S PRETTY GOOD
I THINK THERE WAS A SENSE OF SHE RAISED HIM TO BE THIS HORRIBLE MONSTER SO SHE'S A BAD MOTHER AND IT'S ALL HER FAULT OUR CHILDREN ARE DEAD

NO ONE REALLY REMEMBERS SHE'S A VICTIM TOO AND WILL CONTINUOUSLY BE VICTIMISED ALL HER LIFE IT'S SAD
I READ ONLY THE BOOK AND DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT PERHAPS THEY OVERDID IT IN THE FILM
THAT IS PRETTY ACCURATE WE SADLY HAD A MASSACRE INSIDE A SCHOOL HERE IN BRAZIL BACK IN I LIVE CLOSE TO THE HOUSE BELONGING TO THE SISTER OR SOME KIND OF RELATIVE CAN'T REALLY TELL AND I REMEMBER PEOPLE TOSSING STONES INTO HER HOUSE
MOST HUMAN BEINGS SADLY NEED SOMEONE TO BLAME
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY AT THE CIVIL TRIAL WHERE THEY SUED HER FOR ALL HER MONEY SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE MUCH SHE'D KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT KEVIN WOULD DO SOMETHING HORRIBLE AND WHETHER IT WAS A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY OR NOT SHE NO LONGER HAD THE PATIENCE FOR ANY OF IT
I ONLY SAW THE MOVIE SO CAN'T COMMENT ON THE BOOK I THINK IT'S HUMAN NATURE THAT YOU FOCUS MAINLY ON YOUR OWN PAIN IT TAKES A LOT OF EMPATHY TO BE ABLE TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE PLACE OF THE FAMILY THAT HAS HURT YOU SO MUCH I THOUGHT THE SCENE WITH THE MOM FORCING HERSELF TO EAT THE EGGS WHICH WERE FULL OF BROKEN EGGSHELLS WAS THE MOST GRIPPING PART OF THE MOVIE SHE FELT THAT SHE DESERVED THE SCORN OF EVERYONE AROUND HER AND MADE HERSELF TAKE THE PUNISHMENT SINCE THERE WAS NO OTHER PENANCE SHE COULD DO
BECAUSE SHE WAS FUCKING PATHETIC
I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER HER SAYING IN THE BOOK THAT THE OTHER PARENTS BLAMED HER AND THEN WHEN SHE WENT TO COURT AND SPENT ALL HER MONEY ALL WHILE LOOKING PRETTY STOIC SHE WAS VILIFIED BY THE MEDIA
BECAUSE SHE SPAWNED HIM
IT SURE GOT ATTENTION WHEN IT HIT THE BOOKSTORES IN YOU CAN'T REALLY CRITIQUE IT WITHOUT FOCUSING ON WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE LATE S EARLY SOUTH AND THAT IS WHERE MANY OF THE MAJOR THEMES ARE ROOTED

THE PILL IS APPROVED FOR CONTRACEPTIVE USE

IT S BEEN AN INSTANT HIT AFTER TWO YEARS MILLION AMERICAN WOMEN ARE ON THE PILL AFTER THREE YEARS THE NUMBER ALMOST DOUBLES TO MILLION OVERSEAS IT IS JUST AS POPULAR

BUT THE PILL IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL IT REMAINS ILLEGAL IN EIGHT STATES MANY CATHOLIC COUNTRIES HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO LIMIT ITS USE OR BAN IT OUTRIGHT

IT SEEMS THAT GUILT FREE SEX HAS ITS DETRACTORS

RELIGION

THE WERE A TIME OF EXPLOSIVE RELIGIOUS CHANGE IN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IT WAS A TIME OF INNOVATION FROM THE NEW THEOLOGY AND NEW MORALITY OF BISHOP ROBINSON TO THE EVANGELICALISM OF THE CHARISMATIC MOVEMENT AND OF CHARISMATIC LEADERS SUCH AS POPE JOHN XXIII AND MARTIN LUTHER KING BUT IT WAS ALSO A TIME OF RAPID SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CHANGE WHEN CHRISTIANITY FACED CHALLENGES FROM EASTERN RELIGIONS FROM MARXISM AND FEMINISM AND ABOVE ALL FROM NEW AFFLUENT LIFESTYLES ABSTRACT ABOUT THE BOOK THE RELIGIOUS CRISIS OF THE

NOW YOU THROW INTO THIS TURBULENT TIME A MAN WHO HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF WESTERN SOCIETY AND THE UPHEAVALS IT IS GOING THROUGH HIS GUIDE A CRUSTY GRUFF CYNIC NAMED JUBAL EAST HARSHAW LINES B MASCULINE D SCOTTISH D HE IS DESCRIBED BY HEINLEIN AS A BON VIVANT GOURMET SYBARITE POPULAR AUTHOR EXTRAORDINARY PHILOSOPHER DEVOUT AGNOSTIC PROFESSIONAL CLOWN AMATEUR SUBVERSIVE AND PARASITE BY CHOICE

IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS WAS HEINLEIN HIMSELF USING A PSEUDONYM

TO ME THE BOOK IS ROYAL A H'S TAKE ON THE WORLD AROUND HIM AND WHAT HE SEES WRONG WITH IT HE HAD SOME POINTS IMHO

KURT VONNEGUT REVIEW IN

BOOKS LIFETIMES
I'M A HUGE SCIENCE FICTION FAN AND CONSIDER MYSELF PRETTY OPEN-MINDED WHEN IT COMES TO LITERATURE BUT I THINK THIS BOOK IS VERY MUCH OVERRATED I TRIED VERY HARD TO GET INTO IT BUT I HAVE NO CLUE HOW IT GARNERED THE ACCLAIM THAT IT DID I EVEN READ THE UNCUT VERSION

THERE WAS A THREAD DISCUSSING THIS ELSEWHERE ON REDDIN WHERE IT WAS DESCRIBED AS SOME OLD SEXUAL FANTASY AND I THINK THAT DESCRIPTION IS RATHER APT NO OFFENSE MEANT TO ANYONE WHO LOVES THIS BOOK BUT IT'S NOT FOR ME


TIL
THERE IS AN EXPANDED ORIGINAL EDITION OF SIAL WHICH IS THE AUTHOR'S PREFERRED EDITION
2 I HAVE PROBABLY READ THE ABRIDGED VERSION
THE UNABRIDGED VERSION IS NOT REALLY WORTH READING IT'S SOME WORDS LONGER BUT THEY'RE LARGELY REMOVING EXTRANEOUS DETAILS AND WORDY PHRASINGS THERE'S A FEW RACIER BITS EFT IN BUT REALLY YOU'RE NOT MISSING MUCH THE MOST MEMORABLE JUBAL HARSHAW QUOTE FROM MY READING IT LOVE IS THAT CONDITION IN WHICH THE HAPPINESS OF ANOTHER BECOMES ESSENTIAL TO ONE'S OWN IS ALSO STRANGELY ABSENT THE ORIGINAL PUBLISHED VERSION IS MORE POLISHED I FOUNDATION

I THINK THERE SEEMS TO BE A GENERAL RECOGNITION THAT THIS ONE AND MUCH OF HEINLEIN HASN'T AGED ALL THAT WELL I LIKED HIM A LOT MORE WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER AND THOUGH I TRIED REREADING THIS ONE RECENTLY I FOUND THE SEXUAL CONTENT A LITTLE SELF INDULGENT AND THE FEMALE CHARACTERS FAIRLY TWO-DIMENSIONAL HELL MOST OF THE CHARACTER OTHER THAN FIGURES HARSHAW LAZARUS LONG ETC ARE FLAT MOST OF THE TIME IT'S INTERESTING TO ME NOW AS AN ARTEFACT OF THE ERA AS U ARIZONALAD POINTED OUT BUT NOT REALLY AS A WORK OF LITERATURE
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS AND I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE DIFFERENT VERSIONS IT'S BEEN SEVERAL YEARS SINCE I READ IT LOANED IT TO A FRIEND AND I JUST KNOW I'M NEVER GETTING IT BACK SO YOU'LL HAVE TO REMIND ME ABOUT THE CARYATID SCULPTURE
I FIRST READ THIS BOOK IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND ENJOYED IT THOUGH OF COURSE I MISSED A LOT OF STUFF UNTIL I REREAD IT A FEW YEARS LATER

LET ME THINK ABOUT THE CARYATID A BIT
I LOOK AT HEINLEIN AS AN AUTHOR WHO WROTE POPULAR WORK FOR YOUNG MEN OLD BOYS TO WRITING ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH WOMEN

AT FIRST THE STORIES WERE ABOUT ESTABLISHING MAN'S PLACE IN SOCIETY THROUGH HARD WORK AND THEN BECAME ABOUT SEXUAL WISH FULFILLMENT OF A DOMINEERING PERSONA WHO CAN GRATIFY HIS DESIRES AT A WHIM

STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND IS THE CRUX OF BOTH OF THOSE AND AS A TEENAGER WHO WAS BEING TOLD TO READ AYN THE FOUNTAINHEAD RALPH THE INVISIBLE MAN AND HEINLEIN THIS WON OUT EASILY
I READ THE UNCUT VERSION A FEW YEARS AGO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EDITED VERSION IS LIKE BUT THE ORIGINAL IS DIVIDED INTO PARTS I LOVED THE FIRST TWO AND HATED THE REST IT WAS INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE I EXPECTED TO LOVE THE WHOLE BOOK I WONDER IF THE EDITED VERSION HAS LESS SEXISM AND HOMOPHOBIA THAN THE ORIGINAL
I HOPE YOU GET AN ANSWER HERE BUT IF YOU DON'T YOU MIGHT CONSIDER EMAILING THE PUBLISHER WITH YOUR QUESTION

ANOTHER IDEA IF THERE'S A BOOK STORE NEAR YOU WITH A GOOD SELECTION THEY MIGHT HAVE A COPY OF THE NEWER EDITION THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT FOR YOURSELF
IF THERE'S NO INFO THAT PROBABLY MEANS IT'S NOT ILLUSTRATED IF IT WERE ILLUSTRATED THEY WOULD BE USING THAT AS A SELLING POINT
HI I WORK FOR ONE-WORD SO I'M DEFINITELY QUALIFIED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THE NEW HB EDITION DOES NOT HAVE ILLUSTRATIONS
GOT IT LOOKS GREAT
JUST A GENERAL COMMENT I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN ADAPTATION OF THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLE THAT WAS TRUE TO THE BOOK THEY ALL INSERT THINGS OR CHANGE HOW THINGS HAPPEN ARGH
NOCTURNAL ANIMALS IS THE MOVIE BASED ON AUSTIN NOVEL TONY AND SUSAN THE MAIN PLOT ELEMENT OF THE NOVEL IS RETAINED IN A SLIGHTLY ALTERED FORM IN TONY AND SUSAN SUSAN READS THE MANUSCRIPT OF A THRILLER SENT TO HER BY HER WHICH BECOMES A WHEREAS IN NOCTURNAL ANIMALS IT BECOMES A BUT THE AMBIGUITIES IN NOVEL HAVE ALL BEEN REMOVED THE NOVEL'S USE OF STANDARD THRILLER TROPES SERVES TO UNDERMINE THE EASY CERTAINTIES BUT IN THE MOVIE THE TROPES ARE JUST THAT TROPES AFTER THE HORROR NEAR THE BEGINNING NOTHING VERY UNEXPECTED HAPPENS IT'S QUITE AN EXCITING RIDE AS THESE MIDDLE-CLASS CHARACTERS ESPECIALLY SUSAN ARE FORCED TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THEMSELVES BUT IT DOESN'T ASK THE VIEWER ANY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS AT ALL
I WILL ALWAYS MAINTAIN THAT THE VIALS SERIES BY KATHY AND BRENDAN REICH WOULD HAVE MADE A FANTASTIC TV SERIES ACTION ADVENTURE SCI-FI A BEAUTIFUL LUSH CHARLESTON SETTING PIRATE HISTORY DEBUTANTE DRAMA COME ON THE SHOW WRITES ITSELF

THERE ARE LOTS OF BIG FAILS OUT THERE ARAGON INKHEART THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS BUT I THINK THE WORST FOR ME WILL ALWAYS BE PERCY JACKSON P WASN'T AS BIG AS HP BUT DDK IT GOT CLOSER THAN OTHER SERIES IT WAS HUGE AROUND THE WORLD THEY COULD HAVE MADE SO MUCH MONEY HAD THEY JUST CAST SOME FRESH YOUNG UNKNOWNS MADE THE MOVIES QUICKLY AND STUCK FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE BOOKS BASICALLY IF THEY'D MADE THEM THE WAY THE HP MOVIES WERE MADE HOW DOES HOLLYWOOD LOOK AT A GOLDMINE LIKE THE AJO SERIES AND GO YEP LET'S CAST TWENTYSOMETHINGS AND CHANGE THE WHOLE PLOT SO WE GET ZERO DOLLARS OR PRAISE FOR THIS

GONE GIRL WAS A FANTASTIC ADAPTATION I WAS REALLY SCARED IT WOULDN'T BE DONE CORRECTLY BUT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL

AND AFTER SEEING THE TRAILER FOR THE BIG LITTLE LIES SERIES I AM APPREHENSIVE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO FIT THE FEEL OF THE BOOK WHICH IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS EVER
HOW LONG DO YOU TYPICALLY WAIT AFTER READING A BOOK TO WATCH AN ADAPTATION OF IT WATCHING IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER KIND OF RUINS THE FUN FOR ME SINCE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO PICK IT APART EVEN WITHOUT INTENDING TO AND REALIZE ALL THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE FOR INSTANCE I READ A SCANNER DARKLY EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND WATCHED THE MOVIE THE NIGHT I FINISHED THE BOOK REALLY WISH I HADN'T DONE THAT IT'S A GREAT MOVIE IN ITS OWN RIGHT BUT THERE WERE SOME CHANGES TO THE TIMELINE THAT WERE HARD TO JUSTIFY NARRATIVELY OR THEMATICALLY AND THEY JUST ELIMINATED A CHARACTER AND PUT HIS TRAITS INTO AN ALREADY EXISTING CHARACTER WHICH SEEMED KIND OF LIKE A WASTE OF WHAT THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER WAS MEANT TO REPRESENT OR AT LEAST WHAT I INTERPRETED HIM AS REPRESENTING

ON THE OTHER HAND LAST YEAR I READ WISEGUY AND WATCHED GOODFELLAS THE NIGHT I FINISHED IT COULDN'T HAVE ENJOYED IT MORE IT WAS FUCKING SPOT ON SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TIMELINE BUT THEY ALL MADE SENSE FOR THE MEDIUM THOSE CHANGES WERE FOR PACING AND THEY WORKED THE CHANGES IN A SCANNER DARKLY MADE NO SENSE THEY STILL TOLD THE SAME EVENTS JUST IN A DIFFERENT ORDER THAT KIND OF NEGATED SOME OF THE WEIGHT OF THE STORY I DON'T REMEMBER SPECIFICS IT'S BEEN A BIT BUT I DO REMEMBER IT BUGGING THE HELL OUT OF ME
PUTTING THIS ONE IN A DIFFERENT COMMENT SINCE IT'S MORE CURRENT AT LEAST TO MY LIFE

I FINISHED READING A FEW WEEKS AGO AND STARTED WATCHING THE SHOW SHORTLY AFTER I'M NEAR THE END OF THE SHOW NOW TAKING IT KIND OF SLOW I REALLY ENJOY IT BUT SOME OF THE CHANGES JUST IRK THE HELL OUT OF ME

LIKE IN THE BOOK THE CHARACTER WILL SAY IN NARRATION BUT I WON'T DO X BECAUSE IT WOULD INTERFERE WITH Y AND Z THEN IN THE SHOW THE CHARACTER DOES X COMPLETELY DISREGARDS Y AND Z AND IT STILL WORKS OUT BASICALLY THE SAME WAY THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT IS A PRETTY MAJOR PART OF THE NOVEL AND WHILE MENTIONED IN THE SHOW DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY REAL WEIGHT OR AFFECT WHAT THE MAIN CHARACTER DOES

HE DOES AT ONE POINT SAY TO HIS PARTNER WHOSE NAME I FORGET AND WHO HE TELLS THE ENTIRE SITUATION TO SUPER EARLY ON COMPLETELY NEGATING THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF HIM TELLING HIS LADY FRIEND LATER IN THE BOOK I MEAN THE WHOLE TIME YOU'RE LIKE WHEN'S HE GONNA SHARE IT WITH SOMEONE AND HE FINALLY DOES WITH A WOMAN HE TRUSTS AND IT'S AMAZING THEN IN THE SHOW IT'S JUST THIS GUY THREATENED ME BETTER TELL HIM THE WHOLE THING THEN MAKE HIM MY PARTNER SO THE WRITERS DON'T HAVE TO COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY FOR ME TO EXPRESS MYSELF ANYWAY HE SAYS TO THAT GUY YOU CAN'T TALK TO HER IT COULD MESS WITH STUFF OR WHATEVER BUT IT'S AFTER HE'S ALREADY DONE SO MANY THINGS THAT COULD MESS WITH STUFF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT'S A GOOD SHOW I LOVE IT BUT I HATE IT SO MUCH SPOILER
I JUST FINISHED READING THE FIRST MISBORN NOVEL THE OTHER DAY I HAVE YET TO BUY THE OTHER TWO BUT JESUS THAT SERIES NEEDS TO BE ADAPTED TO THE BIG SCREEN I WAS PRACTICALLY WRITING THE SCREENPLAY AS I WAS READING IT BASICALLY WRITES ITSELF

AND ON THE TOPIC OF SANDERSON WELL WHY HAVE WE YET TO HEAR ANY WORD ABOUT THAT WHEEL OF TIME SHOW THAT SOME STUDIO ALLEGEDLY WAS WORKING ON
IS THERE ANYONE HERE WHO CAN SEE AN ADAPTATION HAPPEN OF THE POWDER MAGE IN EITHER MOVIES OR THE BOOKS ARE WRITTEN SO WELL THAT I CAN DEFINITELY SEE A FUTURE FILM OF IT AND I AM ALREADY REALLY EXCITED
BRITISH TV ADAPTATIONS SEEM TO BE THE BEST IMO I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE RECENT JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR NORRELL ALL OF THE DISCWORLD ADAPTATIONS BUT PARTICULARLY HOGFATHER AND GOING POSTAL THE EVERYWHERE ADAPTATION WITH PETER CAPALDI

FOR THE WORST I HAVE TO SAY THE SWORD OF TRUTH SHOW I LOVED THE EARLY BOOKS I LIKED THE SHOW AT THE BEGINNING AND IT WAS STILL BETTER THAN A LOT OF WHAT WAS ON BROADCAST TV AT THE TIME BUT IT WENT WAY OFF THE RAILS VERY FAST IT UNFORTUNATELY FELL IN THAT TIME JUST BEFORE ORIGINAL STREAMING CONTENT HAD BECOME A VIABLE MEDIUM IT WAS HAPPENING BUT PRETTY EXPERIMENTALLY I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DONE SPLENDIDLY IF IT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED A LITTLE MORE HARD AS A STREAMING ONLY JUST A FEW YEARS LATER
REMOVED
USED BOOKS ARE THE WAY TO GO MY FRIEND
THRIFT SHOPS INCLUDING GOODWILL HABITAT RESTORE SALVATION ARMY ETC OFTEN HAVE A BUNCH OF BOOKS AT REALLY LOW PRICES ALSO CHECK TO SEE IF YOUR LIBRARY SELLS USED BOOKS IN A CORNER SOMEWHERE OR HOLDS A BIG ANNUAL BOOK SALE EVENT MANY OF THEM DO
THERE'S A SITE CALLED

GREAT SITE GET A LOT OF MY BOOKS FROM THERE
USED BOOKS ON AMAZON AT LEAST IF YOU DON'T NEED A PERFECT COPY THEY USUALLY RUN FOR SHIPPING IN THE US AT LEAST
EURO AND UP
CHECK OUT ALL THE THRIFT SHOPS IN YOUR AREA ALSO GARAGE SALES WHEN THEY'RE AROUND

YOU'LL SOON HAVE MORE THAN YOU CAN READ
IN THE PAST I'VE SUGGESTED TO MY FRIENDS WHO ARE INTO BOOKS THAT THEY SHOULD LOOK FOR SECOND-HAND COPIES OF TITLES FROM THE MODERN PENGUIN CLASSICS SERIES NOT ONLY CAN YOU FIND THEM FOR DIRT-CHEAP MOST OF THE TIME MOST STORES I GO TO HAVE THEM AROUND EACH BUT THEY REPRESENT A LARGE PORTION OF HISTORICAL AND MODERN CLASSICS RANGING FROM FICTION TO HISTORY TO CURRENT EVENTS

THEY ALSO LOOK VERY ATTRACTIVE ON YOUR BOOKSHELF
I AGREE WITH THE AMAZON ROUTE IT'S ALSO TO FIND SPECIFIC EDITIONS ON THERE THOUGH ABEBOOKS IS A LITTLE MORE FOCUSED IN THAT ARENA I ALSO VISIT HALF PRICE BOOKS OFTEN SOMETIMES I'LL FIND SOMETHING GOOD AT A GOODWILL BUT I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA SO IT'S MOST OLD HARLEQUIN ROMANCES AND KIDS YA BOOKS SOMEONE HAS DONATED TO CLEAR SPACE
MY LIBRARY SELLS GREAT BOOKS FROM CENTS TO A DOLLAR
THIS MIGHT BE A LONG SHOT BUT IF YOU LIVE IN OR NEAR TENNESSEE BOTH NASHVILLE AND KNOXVILLE HAVE THESE GREAT USED MULTIMEDIA STORES CALLED I'VE WALKED IN THERE WITH AND OUT WITH OR BOOKS IF NOT WHAT OTHERS SAID ABOUT GOODWILL AND OTHER THRIFT STORES IS GOOD ADVICE ALSO PLACES LIKE WAL MART OFTEN MARK THEIR BOOKS WAY DOWN AFTER A WHILE TO GET RID OF THEM
WHY DO YOU WANT A BOOKSHELF OF PHYSICAL BOOKS WHY INVEST MONEY IN SOMETHING YOU WILL MOST LIKELY USE ONCE
R WRITING
I LIKE MORE WHEN THE LEAD VILLAIN HAS A MINION OR TEAM-MATE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE GREAT CHEMISTRY WITH RATHER THAN USING A FAMILY DYNAMIC JUST TO GIVE THE VILLAIN SOME COHORTS
AS A READER I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE MOST COMPELLING VILLAINS TO BE THE ONES WHO HAVE GENUINE EMOTIONAL CONNECTIONS TO OTHERS ON THEIR SIDE WHO TRULY CARE ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE WITH THEM IF A VILLAIN HAS PERSONAL EMOTIONAL AND IDEAL STAKES IN THE STORY THEN THIS IS GREAT I LOVE IT WHEN A WRITER GIVES ME A REASON TO CARE ABOUT A VILLAIN BEYOND THEY ARE EVIL AND BELIEVE WANT TO DO BAD THINGS THIS COULD TAKE THE FORM OF A FAMILY WHICH WOULD GIVE A POSSIBILITY FOR LOOKING AT FAMILY DYNAMICS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY WORK TOGETHER FAMILIES NEVER GET ALONG PERFECTLY OPPOSE THIS TO CHARACTERS LIKE SARON OR VOLDEMORT WHO ARE MORE FAIRY TAIL VILLAINS THERE ISN'T MUCH EMOTIONAL STAKE FOR THE READER IN THEIR ARC I DON'T TRULY HATE OR FEEL FOR THEM MY OPINION'S NOT WORTH THAT MUCH TO BE HONEST BUT THAT'S HOW I FEEL WHEN I'M READING BOOKS
I ENJOYED ALL OF TOLKIENS BOOKS BUT THE PACING IS VERY SLOW THE FIRST HUNDRED PAGES OF LOAR WILL BE A CRAWL
MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF LITERATURE
CONGRATULATIONS I ENJOYED THE BOOKS I'VE READ THEM THREE TIMES OVER THE PAST YEARS IN MY OPINION PARTS OF THE TWO TOWERS
DRAGGED BUT IT DIDN'T DETRACT FROM THE STORY OVERALL ENJOY YOUR READING AND GOOD LUCK ON YOUR FINALS
PLEASE READ THE HOBBIT FIRST

ON THAT NOTE A FRIEND ONCE ASKED ME WHAT ORDER TO READ BOOKS IN I JOKED THAT HE SHOULD READ THE SILMARILLION THE UNFINISHED TALES OF NOUMENON AND MIDDLE EARTH THE HOBBIT AND THEN THE LORD OF THE RINGS HE CAME BACK AND SAID HE HAD A LOT OF FUN READING IT THAT WAY
I LOVED THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING THE WRAITHS ARE SO CREEPY IN IT

I WASN'T SO KEEN ON THE TWO TOWERS DESPITE THAT BEING MY FAVOURITE FILM OF THE TRILOGY

THE RETURN OF THE KING I FOUND BORING WHERE IT CONCERNED ARAGON BUT AMAZING WHERE IT FOLLOWED SAM AND FRODO

IF YOU LOVE THE FILMS YOU'LL AT LEAST LIKE THE BOOK
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT USING MY AUDIBLE CREDITS TO PURCHASE LOAR DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD LISTEN
DID YOU BUY A BOOK THAT INCLUDES ALL THREE LOAR BOOKS I HAD ONE OF THOSE WHEN I WAS YOUNG IT HURT READING IT IF YOU WANTED TO LAY ON YOUR BACK IN BED BECAUSE IT WAS SO HEAVY MY EDITION HAD PICTURES ON HARDER PAPER THROUGH OUT THE BOOK AS WELL IN THE END IT BROKE APART FROM TOO MANY BACKPACK RIDES TO AND FROM SCHOOL AND IT GOT LEFT BEHIND DURING A MOVE SOMETHING I REGRET DEARLY
THE BOOK IS FANTASTIC LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HAS SAID TZOLKIN CAN BE EXTREMELY WORDY BUT IT'S COMPLETELY WORTH THE READ REGARDLESS I PERSONALLY THINK EXCESSIVE IMAGERY HELPS CREATE A BEAUTIFUL STORY IT'S NOT AN EASY READ BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY AN ENJOYABLE ONE

IT'S LIKE READING A YEAR OLD VERSION OF THE MOVIE SCRIPTURE VERY MUCH IN THE STYLE OF BEOWULF
LOAR IS ONE OF MY ABSOLUTE MOST FAVORITE READS I'M NOT AS BIG OF A FAN OF THE HOBBIT AND I THINK THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE I READ IT AFTER LOAR SO I SAW THE PLOT HOLES A BIT MORE THERE ARE APPENDICES AT THE END OF LOAR THAT ADDRESS THESE A LITTLE BIT BUT I MEAN HE WROTE THE HOBBIT BEFORE REALLY GOING FULL ON INTO THE WORLD BUILDING OF MIDDLE EARTH SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT'S NOT AS MUCH AS LOAR ANYWAY HAVE A GREAT READ THERE ARE PARTS THAT MAKE IT TRULY DIFFICULT TO PUT DOWN
I NEVER READ THE LOAR BOOKS JUST THE HOBBIT ARE THERE ANY DEFINITIVE VERSIONS OF LOAR OR ANY TO AVOID MAYBE I'LL PICK UP THE HARDCOVER VERSIONS THIS WEEK AND START

JUST WANT TO SEE IF THERE IS A PRINT BETTER THAN OTHERS
CONGRATS THE BOOKS ARE GREAT I READ THEM WHEN I WAS YOUNG BEFORE THE MOVIES WERE RELEASED REREADING THEM AFTER THE MOVIES WAS STILL QUITE ENJOYABLE AND TO YOUR ADVANTAGE MIGHT EVEN HELP WITH PUTTING PICTURES TO THE LONG DRAWN OUT PORTIONS RELATING TO LORE AND FAMILY LINES STICK WITH IT EVEN IF IT SLOWS IT ULTIMATELY PICKS UP THE PACE AND IS SUCH AN AMAZING READ I STALLED HALFWAY THROUGH THE TWO TOWERS THE FIRST TIME I READ THEM IT JUST GOT TOO BORING FOR A YEAR OLD AND HONESTLY THE BATTLE IN THE MOVIE WAS WAYLAY MORE DRAWN OUT AND COOL THAN IN THE BOOK HOPEFULLY YOU'LL ENJOY THEM AND GO ON TO THE OTHER GREAT BOOKS IN THE COLLECTION ONCE YOU'VE READ THOSE I'D RECOMMEND THE TZOLKIN GENESIS THE SILMARILLION GOOD LUCK
YOU WILL FIND IT A LITTLE SLOW AT THE START THEN IT PICKS UP AND IS GREAT UNTIL THE MIDDLE WHERE IT BOGS DOWN SO MUCH THAT YOU WILL WONDER IF YOU CAN GET THROUGH IT BUT KEEP GOING IT GETS BETTER TOWARD THE END AND THE LAST LITTLE CODA ABOUT THE SHIRE IS WORTH READING ALSO
I'VE READ BOTH LORD OF THE RINGS AND THE HOBBITS I REALLY LIKED THEM AND YEAH I AGREE SOMETIMES IT CAN BE DULL SO MANY DETAILS BTW SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT HIS BOOKS ARE JUST FOR CHILDREN I ENJOYED THEM ANYWAY
ITS DEFINITELY NOT DALI IF YOU REALLY TAKE THE TIME TO SOAK IT UP I LOVED EVERY MOMENT THE FIRST TIME I READ IT AND EVEN MORE SO THE SECOND THEN THE FILMS CAME ALONG AND KIND OF RUINED THAT TO SOME EXTENT

FOR ME IT WAS ALL ABOUT IMAGINING MYSELF IN SHOES AND REALLY VISUALIZING THE ADVENTURE AND THE WORLD IT'S SET IN

THE CHAPTERS ON THE ELVES AND LOTHLORIEN ARE PURE MAGIC
HE DOES GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL AND THAT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE BUT I LOVE HIS WRITING STYLE I THINK LOAR BOOKS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE HOBBIT IT TOOK ME THREE DAYS TO READ LOAR AND THREE WEEKS TO READ THE HOBBIT
IF YOU ENJOY IT AND YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH THAN YOU SHOULD ALSO TRY THE SILMARILLION
TO ME IT WAS COMPARABLE TO MELVILLE HONESTLY MOST PEOPLE FIND IT OFF POUTINGLY SLOW BUT NOT ENOUGH TO DETRACT FROM THE ENJOYMENT OF THE BOOK
YOU KNOW THAT SCENE WHEN THE ANTS SPEND HOURS AND HOURS TALKING AND ONLY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MERRY AND PIPPIN ARE NOT ORCS THAT'S WHAT LOAR BOOKS FELT TO ME
HERE'S THE LIST

THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES BY RAY BRADBURY

DUNE BY FRANK HERBERT
COULD HAVE BEEN OR EVEN PLENTY LEFT OFF THE LIST HYPERION CANTOS ANYONE
DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP NEEDS TO BE ON THIS LIST
I HATE HOW ALL THESE LIST NEVER SEEM TO TELL YOU WHAT THE ACTUAL BOOK IS ABOUT JUST A BUNCH OF BUZZWORDS AND QUOTES HOWEVER THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW THAT SUPPLIES A LINK TO A SYNOPSIS
A FEW MONTHS AGO THERE WAS AN ESTATE SALE FOR AN OLD HISTORY PROFESSOR I WAS ABLE TO GRAB HIS SCIENCE FICTION COLLECTION HIS BASEMENT WAS FILLED WALL TO WALL WITH BOOKS WITH A BOOKSHELF DEDICATED TO SCIENCE FICTION A FEW OF THESE WERE IN THERE WHICH COMBINED WITH MY OWN COLLECTION MEANS I HAVE ALL OF THESE

THIS ISN'T REALLY RELEVANT OTHER THAN I LUCKED OUT
A CO-WORKER OF MINE LENT ME DUNE ONE NIGHT WHEN I HAD A TON OF DOWNTIME IT WAS THE FIRST LEISURE BOOK I'VE READ IN YEARS AND MADE ME GET A LIBRARY CARD SO I COULD FINISH IT LOOKS LIKE I'LL HAVE TO TRY THESE OTHER BOOKS NOW
WHY IS JAMES FRANCO ON THE COVER OF FOREVER WAR
CAME EXPECTING ANOTHER SHITTY DRUDGE LIST WAS SURPRISED THAT IT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD

I'D REPLACE DAHLGREN WITH BOOK OF THE NEW SUN AS BOTH ARE GOOD BUT THE LATTER IS A STRONGER EXAMPLE
I MISS STANISLAW LEM ON THE LIST SOLARIS WAS VERY INFLUENTIAL ALSO THE THE STAR DIARIES COULD HAVE BEEN MENTIONED
NOT A SINGLE IAIN MASCULINE BANKS BOOK
I FUCKING HATE EVERY PERSON WHO DOES A WEBSITE LIKE THAT ONE BOOK AND TWO HUNDRED BANNER ADDS I'M NOT GIVING THEM ALL THE TIME AND ENERGY IT TAKES TO CLICK THROUGH THAT BULLSHIT LET ALONE THE ADD DOLLARS THAT COME WITH IT


RINGWORLD IS SUCH A GREAT BOOK HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SEQUEL IS GOOD BUT AFTER THAT GETS MPH

I ALSO RECOMMEND BOOK PROTECTOR
NO CANTICLE FOR LEBOWITZ

SHAKING MY GOT DANG HEAD
BUT WHAT ABOUT HYPERION
HERE ARE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY BOOKS

SO THERE'S ROOM FOR FOUR MORE THEN
NOT A SINGLE BOOK BY PHILIP K DICK THIS LIST IS INVALID


I ENJOYED THE LIST AND THE ARTICLE BUT HOW CAN YOU DISCUSS THE PROTOTYPICAL NATURE OF VALENTINE MICHAEL SMITH FROM STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND WITHOUT MENTIONING THAT IT'S BASICALLY A MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT RETELLING OF THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST A GUY COMES DOWN FROM HEAVEN WELL SPACE WHO IS HALF MAN AND HALF SUPERNATURAL HAS MAGICAL POWERS IS PERSECUTED BUT FORMS A DEDICATED FOLLOWING AND FOUNDS A CHURCH THEN HE'S STONED TO DEATH AND HIS DISCIPLES EAT SOUP MADE FROM HIS BODY

I KNOW HEINLEIN AND STRANGE LAND IN PARTICULAR IS A CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC ON R BOOKS BUT IT REALLY IS GREAT AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY SCI-FI FAN WHO HASN'T READ IT
I LOVED SLAUGHTER HOUSE FIVE BUT I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF IT AS SCIENCE FICTION I GUESS IT TECHNICALLY IS BUT I JUST THOUGHT OF IT AS CREATIVE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OR SOMETHING
WIND-UP GIRL IS A LOT BETTER AS A BLURB WRITTEN FOR A LIST THAN AS AN ACTUAL BOOK BORING AS HELL
DON'T PANIC
I'D ADD HYPERION TO THIS LIST ITS SOO GOOD
OKAY THIS LIST IS SERIOUSLY LACKING IN THE PHILIP KING DICK DEPARTMENT BIK OR DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP ARE ESSENTIALS
THE STARS MY DESTINATION NEEDS TO BE ON EVERY ONE OF THESE LISTS
NO IAIN M BANKS JACK VANCE GENE WOLFE OR PHILIP K DICK
ANYONE THAT'S READ DAHLGREN HOW IS IT
NO OCTAVIA BUTLER SHE GAVE SO MUCH TO A GENRE THAT STILL HAS HUGE PROBLEM FILLING THE HOLE HER DEATH LEFT
GOOD LIST I'D ADD GAME OR SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD TOO
I ENJOY HOW MANY OF THESE ARE THE BASIS FOR IRON MAIDEN SONGS
NO STANISLAW LEM NO PAGE KING DICK NOT A DISTANT WINK TO CORDWAINER SMITH THIS IS JUST A BEST SELLER LIST SURE SOME ARE INCREDIBLE WORKS BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE JUST A COINCIDENCE
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE ISSUE FORM THE WESTERN PERSPECTIVE

ACTUALLY IN THE COMMUNIST BLOCK THERE WAS A VERY WELL DEVELOPED SCIENCE FICTION GENRE SOME SAY IT WAS DUE TO THE EFFORTS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE BLEAK ACTUAL EXISTING CONDITIONS BY CREATING BRIGHT VISIONS OF THE FUTURE

NAMES LIKE LEM YEFREMOV STRUGATSKY BROTHERS MEAN NOTHING TO A WESTERN READER WHILE THEIR CREATIONS WERE ARGUABLY BETTER THAN THE BEST EXAMPLES OF WESTERN SCIENCE FICTION OF THE SAME PERIOD
NO MARY SHELLEY H G WELLS H PAGE HOVERCRAFT OR STANISLAW LEM
GREAT LIST I'D LOVE TO JUST ADD ON SOME KD NOVELS ON HERE BUT I KNOW HE'S A BIT HIT OR MISS FOR PEOPLE ALSO I LEAN ILLUSTRATED MAN OVER THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES
I OWN THEM ALL EXCEPT FOR THE WINDUP GIRL ANYONE CARE TO SHARE THEIR OPINION ON THAT BOOK SHOULD I BUY IT AS WELL
HYPERION MY FIRST SCI-FI BOOK
HAPPY TO SAY I'VE READ SNOW CRASH FOREVER WAR AND DUNE AND THEY ALL CERTAINLY DESERVE TO BE ON THIS LIST I THINK I'LL HAVE TO TACKLE OF FEW MORE OF THEM

ALSO ALL THE RESPONSES TO THIS POST HAVE HELPED ME FILL MY LIST OF FUTURE READS YOU ARE ALL AWESOME
WALTER M MILLER A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ IS NOT ON THIS LIST THE VALUE AS AN OPINION IS SERIOUSLY DOUBTFUL
I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS IN MOST IMPORTANT LEAST IMPORTANT

BUT IF IT IS DUNE SHOULD NOT BE AT THE BOTTOM

ARGUABLY THE GENRE DEFINING BOOK

ALSO WHY NO ORSON SCOTT CARD HIS WORKS ON SCIENCE FICTION ARE WHY HE IS REGARDED AS ONE OF THE TOP SCI-FI WRITERS OF ALL TIME EVEN IF HIS MOVIE ADAPTATIONS ARE LACKING
I ROBOT WITH ITS LAWS OF ROBOTICS WAS MORE OF A GENRE CHANGER THAN THE FOUNDATION BOOKS IMHO

ANY LIST OF INFLUENTIAL SF THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THESE HUGELY INFLUENTIAL WORKS IS PRETTY MUCH INVALID

FRANKENSTEIN
STRANGE CASE OF DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE
BRAVE NEW WORLD
NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR

AND HOW DOES A BOOK ONLY PUBLISHED SEVEN YEARS AGO FOREVER CHANGE THE GENRE I DON'T THINK SO

I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE NECROMANCER BUT IT JUST SEEMED SO CONFUSING AND ALL OVER THE PLACE THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I HAD NO CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON
WIND-UP GIRL BY PAOLO BACIGALUPI

LOL
DELETED
STARSHIP TROOPERS DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT
WHAT ABOUT OR BRAVE NEW WORLD AND STUFF ARE THEY SCI-FI OR CLASSIFIED AS SOMETHING ELSE GENUINELY ASKING
A FAILURE TO MENTION THE GRANDMOTHER OF GENETIC ENGINEERING ANNE MCCAFFERRE
SURPRISINGLY GOOD LIST EVEN CONSIDERING THE BOOKS THAT PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH IMPACT ON THE GENRE AS A WHOLE AND THE MISSING BOOKS THAT ARGUABLY HAD A MUCH LARGER IMPACT
I STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH SNOWCRASH OR NECROMANCER
THE CANTICLES OF LEBOWITZ HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE THAT ON YOUR MINE ANY LIST
MISSING AT LEAST

ALDOUS HUXLEY BRAVE NEW WORLD

EVERY TIME I SEE RINGWORLD COME UP THESE DAYS I'M WONDERING HOW LONG UNTIL SOME BRIGHT DIRECTOR IN HOLLYWOOD ADAPTS THE TRILOGY TO FILM WE DEFINITELY HAVE THE CGI FOR IT NOW IF PROPERLY REALIZED IT COULD BE A SWEEPING SF EPIC THAT BLOWS AWAY EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE IT I'D TAKE IT OVER STAR WARS ANY DAY

NECROMANCER IS A MASTERPIECE
THE THING I ALWAYS FOUND FASCINATING ABOUT IN A STRANGE LAND WAS HOW IT FELT UNIQUELY IN REPERTOIRE A SYNERGY OF STANDARD HEINLEIN STORYTELLING AND MAINSTREAM SELF-IMPORTANCE IN THE VEIN OF MANY OTHER BOOKS IN THIS LIST SMITH AS A CHARACTER THE ROK IDEA AND CASUAL CANNIBALISM ARE ALL VERY ATYPICAL CONCEPTS FOR A HEINLEIN NOVEL BUT JUBAL HARSHAW AND HIS GANG OF FRIENDS OF CONSPICUOUS INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY VERY HEINLEIN IN THIS RESPECT I HAVE LONG REGARDED IN A STRANGE LAND AS A SORT OF GATEWAY NOVEL FOR PEOPLE TO DISCOVER THE AUTHOR
NO JOHN CARTER
KIND OF SURPRISED THE WIND UP GIRL IS ON THIS LIST NO GREG BEAR OR IAN M BANKS OR STANISLAW LEM
I DON'T THINK THEY CHANGED THE GENRE BUT I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO HARRY HARRISON AND THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT BOOKS MAN I LOVED THOSE AS A KID
STARSHIP TROOPERS BY HEINLEIN WOULD BY IN MY TOP AND MODERN SCI-FI WRITER OLD MAN'S WAR
CAME TO MAKE SURE SNOW CRASH WAS ON THE LIST EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT
MEN AND WOMAN
RECENTLY READ THE WIND UP GIRL I'M LEFT QUESTIONING HOW IT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE CHANGED THE GENRE IT DID NOT STRIKE ME AS REVOLUTIONARY OR ORIGINAL IN ANY REAL WAY


I JUST REALISED THAT THIS IS LIKELY TO BE DOWN VOTED OH WELL
ORSON SCOTT CARD ANYONE
THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH IS THE OLDEST STORY IN EXISTENCE AT ALMOST YEARS OLD AND HAS INFLUENCED MANY READ ALMOST ALL STORIES SINCE AS THE STORY OF A MAN WHO IS IMBUED WITH OTHERWORLDLY POWERS TO PROTECT A SOCIETY I BELIEVE IT COUNTS AS SCI-FI THE OLDEST MOST INFLUENTIAL SCI-FI

WIKI
WHY IS NEARLY EVERYTHING IN THE COMMENTS A COMPLAINT IT'S A GREAT LIST SURE LOTS OF OTHER GREAT BOOKS OUT THERE INSPIRED SOME CONVERSATION AT LEAST AND I'M INSPIRED TO SEVERAL AND CHECK OUT SOME NEW ONES I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH

THANKS FOR THE LIST AND POST
I TOOK A CLASS AT A SUNY SCHOOL THAT WAS TAUGHT BY NANCY KRESS A HUGO AND NEBULA AWARD WINNER AND BECAUSE OF HER I'VE READ ALMOST ALL OF THESE AMAZING BOOKS IT WAS SO LONG AGO I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER MUCH OF THE CLASS BUT SHE OPENED UP MY EYES TO SO MANY OTHER SCI-FI WRITERS
WOW AS A HUGE FAN OF SCI FI THIS LIST IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD HONESTLY MOST OF THE TIME THESE LISTS TEND TO BE WEAKER UNKNOWN BOOKS THIS IS ACTUALLY A LIST OF BOOKS THAT ACTUALLY CHANGED THE GENRE AND STOOD THE TEST OF TIME

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANY FAN OF SCIENCE FICTION TO READ ALL THE BOOKS ON THE LIST
I'M MAD DUNE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST I'M HALFWAY THROUGH THE 4TH BOOK IN THE SERIES NOW AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY IT'S A TRULY UNIQUE FRANCHISE UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE I'VE SEEN IN SCI-FI FANTASY
I ONLY CHECKED THIS THREAD TO SEE IF THEY INCLUDED SNOW CRASH
HOW IS DUNE
NEVER HEARD OF DAHLGREN SO I'M PLANNING TO PICK THAT UP SOMEWHERE THE OTHERS SEEM FAIRLY PEDESTRIAN AT LEAST FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN READING SCI-FI FOR A WHILE
I WOULD HAVE INCLUDED STARSHIP TROOPERS AS IT WAS THE FIRST SCIENCE FICTION BOOK TO INTRODUCE A NON-WHITE MAIN CHARACTER
IMPORTANT SCI FI LITERATURE BUT NOT MENTIONING PERRY RHODA
NO HYPERION LIST IS INVALID
HUH KIND OF SURPRISED I HAVEN'T SEEN FRANKENSTEIN MENTIONED BY ANYONE HERE YET I KNOW IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS MORE OF A HORROR BOOK BUT I'D ARGUE IT'S HADA PRETTY HUGE IMPACT ON SCIENCE FICTION
I'M SORRY BUT I THOUGHT THE FIRST FOUNDATION NOVEL WAS BORING AND UNIMPORTANT THERE'S ALMOST NO DESCRIPTION OF ANYTHING AND CHARACTERS WHO ONLY LAST CHAPTER I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF A SINGLE CHARACTER I BOUGHT IT EXPECTING SOMETHING EPIC DUE TO ALL ITS ACCOLADES AND AWARDS I FINISHED IT THINKING WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL NO DESIRE TO READ ANY OF THE OTHERS
I WAS GETTING WORRIED DUNE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS LIST
PAOLO WIND-UP GIRL SEEMS LIKE THE ODD MAN OUT ON THIS LIST DID CLIMATE FOCUSED SCIFI REALLY ORIGINATE WITH THIS BOOK IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY BOOK ON THE LIST THAT DOESN'T REALLY DESERVE ITS SLOT BUT THAT MIGHT BE BECAUSE I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE IT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT HASN'T HAD ANYWHERE NEAR THE IMPACT THE OTHER BOOKS ON THIS LIST HAVE HAD BUT MAYBE I'VE JUST MISSED IT

I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS THINK ABOUT IT
FRANKENSTEIN BY MARY SHELLY
TO MY MIND A SPACE ODYSSEY SHOULD BE IN THIS LIST
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF DAHLGREN BUT I'VE READ ALL THE REST OFF TO AMAZON I GO
NO ENDERS GAME SURPRISED
GAME ISN'T ON HERE DESPITE PREDICTING THE CURRENT STATE OF THE INTERNET LONG BEFORE THE WORLD WIDE WEB EVEN EXISTED AMONG ALL IT'S OTHER VIRTUES ANOTHER PREDICTION I NOTICED TODAY PETER MEANS WHAT HE'S SAYING WHEN HE'S SAYING IT BUT HE'LL ONLY DO THINGS THAT ARE TO HIS BENEFIT THAT'S WHY HE'LL MAKE SUCH A GOOD POLITICIAN ONE DAY GEE WHY DOES A POLITICIAN SAYING A LOT OF OUTRAGEOUS THINGS TO GET HIS WAY THEN TURNING AROUND AND DOING SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SOUND FAMILIAR
DAHLGREN SOUNDS SUPER INTERESTING HAS ANYONE HERE READ IT
NO A WRINKLE IN TIME NO COUNTY SOUTH LEWIS WTF
NO PHILLIP KING DICK COME ON
UPSET AT THE OMISSION OF HARRY STAINLESS STEEL RAT AND MY GOSH SNOW CRASH WAS PUBLISHED IN I FEELS OLD BOOD
A LITTLE SURPRISED BY THE LACK OF JOHN CARTER IT WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST SCIENCE FICTION BOOK SERIES TO BE WRITTEN
MY FAVOURITE AUTHORS ARE NOT ON THE LIST THEREFORE THE LIST IS GARBAGE
CAN PEOPLE THAT HAVE READ DAHLGREN GIVE ME THEIR OPINIONS ON IT I'VE OWNED THE BOOK FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW BUT KEEP PUTTING IT OFF TO READ BECAUSE OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT IT SEEMS VERY DAUNTING

AND WHAT IS IT ABOUT I'M STILL CONFUSED ON THAT TOO THE BLURB DOESN'T REALLY EXPLAIN SHIT
I THINK GAME DESERVES AN HONORABLE MENTION THE BOOK ITSELF WAS INTENDED FOR ADULTS WITH VERY ADULT THEMES DESPITE MOST OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS BEING CHILDREN

THAT UH CONFUSION BETWEEN IF THIS WAS A KIDS BOOK VS ADULT BOOK LANDED IT IN MY HANDS WHEN I WAS TOTALLY CHANGED THE WAY I LOOKED AT THE SCIENCE FICTION GENRE STILL TO THIS DAY NOW THE TIME ENDER SPENDS AT THE BATTLE SCHOOL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CONCEPTIONAL MEMORIES FROM READING

IT WAS LIKE HARRY POTTER GOING THROUGH SCHOOL BUT WITH TIMES THE GRIT VIOLENCE REPLACING MAGIC WITH STARSHIP TROOPERS STYLE SCIENCE MINUS A LOT OF THE FLUFF
FUCKING CORDWAINER SMITH AND DOC SMITH
WHAT NO LOVE FOR IAIN MASCULINE BANKS ON THE LIST HIS CULTURE SERIES REDEFINED THE SPACE OPERA AND EXPLORED HOW A POST SCARCITY CIVILISATION WOULD WORK NOT TO MENTION PRESENTING A HOPEFUL VIEW OF HOW AI COULD CO-EXIST WITH ORGANIC BEINGS FOR A CHANGE I'D TAKE HIM OVER PAOLO BACIGALUPI ANY DAY IF A MODERN ADDITION WERE NEEDED LEAVING OUT PHILIP K DICK ALSO INEXCUSABLE AS OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT
THREE BODY PROBLEM BY LIU BIXIN WAS ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I HAVE EVER READ IT ALSO COMPLETELY CHANGED MY OPINION ON SEVERAL TROPES IN SCIFI
NO TZOLKIN LOAR IS THE GREATEST FANTASY EPIC OF OUR TIME ACCORDING TO THE COVER ON ALL BOOKS
WHAT ABOUT FAHRENHEIT BRAVE NEW WORLD ALSO NOT A SINGLE CRICHTON JURASSIC PARK ANDROMEDA STRAIN ANDROMEDA STRAIN INFLUENCED ENTIRE SWATHS OF MEGA GERM BOOKS TO COME LIKE THE STANDARD
YOU HAVE TO BE AIDIN DUNE ON PLACE THERE NEVER WAS AND THERE WILL NEVER BE A SF SERIES THAT INFLUENCED MORE PEOPLE AND THE GENRE THAN DUNE
BIK SHOULD BE ON HERE
NEITHER NOR BRAVE NEW WORLD MENTIONED WHILE THEY CRAM SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE IN THERE AS SCI-FI FOR SHAME
WHERE IS THE HERO WHO CAN POST US A CONDENSED LIST AND SAVE US FROM THE CLICKBAIT
NO ALFRED BESTER NO PHILLIP KING DICK NO STRUGATSKY BOTHERS BOO
UMMMMMM JURASSIC PARK WHERE ARE YOU HOW CAN ANY LIST LIKE THIS NOT INCLUDE REVOLUTIONARY MASTERPIECE
NO MARY SHELLEY SHAMEFUL
WHAT A SAUSAGE FEST WHERE'S FRANKENSTEIN
I HATE CLICKBAIT SO MUCH HOWEVER I'M GLAD RINGWORLD WAS IN
THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING SHOULD BE AT THE TOP IT OPENED UP FANTASY AND SCI FI
I WAS HOPING TO SEE ROADSIDE PICNIC AND GAME BUT THOSE BOOKS ARE FIRE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE IS BY FAR ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS
HOW IS ALDOUS BRAVE NEW WORLD NOT IN THIS LIST IT WAS PUBLISHED IN AND IS STILL SO RELEVANT TO OUR CULTURE
IT WOULD BE FUN TO READ THESE IN THE ORDER OF THEIR PUBLICATION DATE
AND NOW I'M DONE MAKING MY CHRISTMAS LIST
HUM SOMEHOW DISAGREE WITH THE LIST AND READ ALL OF THEM EXCEPT BACIGALUPI

NO OLAF STAPLETON AS FAR AS AN AUTHOR CHANGING THE GENRE I JUST DON'T SEE HOW YOU EXCLUDE HIM HIS TWO BOOKS READ CONTAIN MOST OF THE IDEAS THAT DOMINATED SCIENCE FICTION THAT IS THE MOST BAFFLING ABSENCE TO ME

NO YOU COULD ARGUE THAT HE WAS NOT A HUGELY SUCCESSFUL AUTHOR DURING HIS LIFETIME BUT IS THERE TODAY A SCIENCE FICTION AUTHOR WHOSE WORK HAS BEEN MORE USED IN THE MAINSTREAM SOCIETY
SUPER SAD LACK OF NEURONOVELS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST GAMECHANGING KINDS OF NOVELS THAT WERE CREATED IN THE LAST
WHEN YOU'VE ONLY READ FOUNDATION
GUIDE TO THE GALAXY BY DOUGLAS ADAMS

CAME EXPECTING THIS

WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED
STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND WAS FANTASTIC
DELETED
PRETTY SURE RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA RAMA II COULD BE INCLUDED IN HERE I KNOW THAT'S GIVING CLARKE AN EXTRA ENTRY BUT IT'S HARD TO DENY THE MAN DESERVES IT

THAT SERIES SPOKE TO ME MORE THAN SOME MORE PROLIFIC WORKS IT'S HARD TO QUANTIFY JUST WHAT IT IS ABOUT IT I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST HONEST REPRESENTATIONS OF AN EVOLVING SOCIAL DYNAMIC AND THE HORROR OF HUMANITY IN THE WIDER UNIVERSE WITH JUST ENOUGH OF A GLIMMER OF HOPE

KEN THE STAR FRACTION ALWAYS STRUCK ME AS A FANTASTIC EXPOSITION OF A AI SINGULARITY IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY NEW BUT IT DID OPEN UP THE TOPIC IN A WAY I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE MAYBE JUST ME THOUGH
WHY THOUGH IT SIMPLY COULD BE OR AND THEY COULD ADD A LOT OF MASTERPIECE WHICH THEY DIDN'T
I CAN HIGHLY RECOMMEND PETER FOLIO HAMILTON BOTH HIS COMMONWEALTH SAGA AND THE ARMAGEDDON CYCLE ARE AN AMAZING SERIES OF BOOKS CURRENTLY INTO THE VOID CHRONICLES WHICH FOLLOWS AFTER THE COMMONWEALTH SAGA AND IT'S AMAZING
COMMENTING SO I CAN COME BACK
JAMES FRANCO ON THE FRONT COVER OF THE FOREVER WAR
NEVER GOT THE FEEL FOR THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BORING AND GOT PRETTY LOST ON THE STORY THAT'S ONE I WOULD EXCHANGE WITH READY PLAYER ONE

BTW THOSE BOOKS ARE ALL QUITE OLD SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NO GOOD SF BOOKS THESE DAYS WHICH IS NOT TRUE AT ALL
WHY IS THIS ON LIFEHACKER AND NOT WHAT HAPPENED TO
I KNOW IT FALLS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF UTOPIAN DYSTOPIAN BUT I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN WE BY YEVGENY ZAMYATIN ON HERE IF NOTHING ELSE FOR ITS DIRECT INFLUENCE ON BRAVE NEW WORLD AND SUCH A GREAT BOOK
THE STARS MY DESTINATION AND THIS YEARS ARTHUR C CLARKE WINNER CHILDREN OF TIME ARE SCI-FI BEASTS
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHICH BOOK IS IN THE THUMBNAIL
PAGE KING DICK S BOOKS ARE MISSING IN THAT LIST
I'M SO GLAD I READ HITCHHIKER WHEN I WAS YOUNG STUPID AND STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL IF I DID READ IT WITH A FULLY DEVELOP ADULT MIND IT MIGHT OF EXPLODED
READ SIX OF THOSE SO FAR
NOT GOING TO LIE I HONESTLY HATED NECROMANCER AND SNOW CRASH

WOULD REPLACE EITHER OF THEM WITH HYPERION IN A HEARTBEAT THAT BOOK IS EASILY THE COOLEST FRAME NARRATIVE I HAVE EVER READ
LARRY NIVEN IS MY FAVOURITE AUTHOR AND RINGWORLD IS HIS BEST KNOWN WORK BUT HOW DID IT FOREVER CHANGE THE GENRE
WHY THE FUCK ISN'T KAREL CAPEK HERE
HE FRIGGING INVENTED THE WORD ROBOT
READ ALL BUT
THE TIME MACHINE H G WELLS SHOULD BE UP THERE TOO
AS COOL AS SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE IS I DON'T SEE HOW IT FOREVER CHANGED THE GENRE FLATLAND A ROMANCE OF MANY DIMENSIONS
IS NOT CONSIDERED SCIENCE FICTION THATS THE ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN THINK OF THAT WOULD EXCUSE IT FROM BEING PUT ON THIS LIST
HOW CAN KD NOT BE ON THIS LIST
AS I WAS MOVING THROUGH THE LIST I WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE UPSET AT THE LACK OF DUNE BUT THEN
NO HYPERION BY DAN SIMMONS
I LOVED JULES VERNE ALL I READ WHEN I WAS OR UNTIL I DISCOVERED CALVIN HOBBES
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FOUNDATION IS WAY OVERRATED I FOUND IT EXTREMELY REDUNDANT
MISSING JOHN BRUNNER
HYPERION DAN SIMMONS
OMITTING ALFRED BESTER TAKES ALL CREDIBILITY OUT OF THIS LIST
DAMN NOT A SINGLE BOOK FROM COUNTY SOUTH LEWIS SPACE TRILOGY
I REALLY THINK THEY HAD A LOT OF INFLUENCE ON HOW TO PROPERLY APPROACH SCIENCE FICTION
I AM BOTH PLEASED THAT I'VE READ ALMOST ALL OF THOSE BOOKS AND THAT I HAVEN'T READ ALL THOSE BOOKS

SCI FI IS MY FAVORITE GENRE BY FAR AND I HAVE MY DADS BANANA CARTON FULL OF BOOKS THAT I FOUND IN THE CELLAR TO THANK FOR IT FROM WHICH I PROCURED THE COPY OF RINGWORLD THAT STARTED IT ALL

IN CASE ANYBODY WITH NO BACKGROUND IN SCI FI AT ALL IS READING THIS MOST IF NOT ALL BOOKS IN THIS LIST ARE VERY GOOD AND IF YOU READ NOTHING ELSE READ THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE SERIES AS IT'S NOT JUST SOLID SCI FI BUT ALSO EXTREMELY FUNNY LIKE WHEN DID I LAST HAVE TO SET A BOOK ASIDE FOR A MINUTE BECAUSE I'M LAUGHING TOO HARD FUNNY


HOW IS THE TIME MACHINE NOT ON HERE
I AGREE WITH MOST OF THE LIST BUT WHERE THE HECK IS STANISLAW LEM WITHOUT DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS SOLARIS AND GOLEM XIV ARE MASTERPIECES
I HAVE READ THE FIRST ONE TWICE AND THE SECOND AND LAST ONE ONCE WHAT WOULD BE NEXT IN THE MIDDLE
NO HOVERCRAFT CTHULU DAMN THEM ALL
ROGER LORD OF LIGHT DID THINGS WITH SCIENCE FICTION THAT IS STILL ASTONISHING TO THIS DAY UNFORTUNATELY JUST TALKING ABOUT THE BOOK IN ALMOST ANY CAPACITY IS A DAMN SPOILER
I READ WINDUP THINK IT WAS A VERY BIG DEAL I'VE PROBABLY READ BOOKS FROM VARIOUS GENRES THAT WERE BETTER SINCE I THINK ENDERS GAME SHOULD BE ON THERE I'D ALSO RECOMMEND ONE CALLED SATURN RUN BY CETIN AND JOHN SANDFORD I THINK SATURN RUN EMBODIES WHAT MAKES SCI-FI FUN AND IMPORTANT
I HAD MY DOUBTS ABOUT THIS LIST AS ULTIMATE LISTS SELDOM LIVE UP THE THEIR ADVANCE BILLING

RINGWORLD A SO CALLED HARD SCIENCE FICTION BOOK IS QUITE OFTEN IGNORED TO GET A BETTER FEEL FOR IT YOU SHOULD READ THE SHORT STORY ANTHOLOGIES NEUTRON STAR AND TALES OF KNOWN SPACE


BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH VONNEGUT BEING THE CAPSTONE ON A DECENT LIST AND SERIOUSLY WHY NOT SIRENS OF TITAN
NO IT'S LIKE THE PERFECT SCI-FI BOOK
WELL I MEAN THE COMING RACE RESULTED IN ESOTERIC CULTS BEING FORMED AND QUITE POSSIBLY INFLUENCED QUEST FOR ARYANS BUT YEAH MAN LEAVE IT OFF THE LIST AND PUT HITCHHIKER ON THERE BECAUSE
NO EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS

DAFT HEATHENS
NO GAME OR ANY ORSON SCOTT CARD BOOKS
NEEDS HYPERION FITTED IN SOMEWHERE
NO STANISLAW LEM LIST CAN GO RIGHT INTO THE TRASH
YEAH I'M CALLING BULLSHIT ON WIND-UP GIRL OTHER THAN THAT NOT A TERRIBLE LIST
I HAVE NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT WE HAVE SEEN ANOTHER TECTONIC SHIFT IN THE SF WORLD WITH THE THREE BODY PROBLEM TRILOGY GIVE IT FIVE TEN YEARS AND PEOPLE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDING IT ON LISTS LIKE THESE
GODDAMN DO I HOPE TO BE ON THAT LIST SOME DAY

GOES BACK TO WRITING BOOKS

MAYBE I SHOULD ACTUALLY FINISH A BOOK BEFORE I GET ANY BIG IDEAS
MISSING EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS AND HP HOVERCRAFT BUT OTHERWISE PRETTY SOLID LIST
NO HYPERION BAH
AND THE STARS MY DESTINATION BULLSHIT LIST
POSSIBLE SPOILERS I READ THE FOUNDATION TRILOGY AND I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S SO WELL-REGARDED THE BASIC STORYLINE OF PREDICTIVE SCIENCE WAS REALLY INTERESTING BUT WHEN PEOPLE RANDOMLY STARTED DEVELOPING PSYCHIC SUPERPOWERS IT JUST TOOK A TURN FOR ME THAT IT NEVER RECOVERED FROM BY THE TIME SECRET ORGANIZATIONS OF PSYCHICALLY SUPERPOWERED PEOPLE START DUKING IT OUT I HAD LOST ALL INTEREST
NO ORSON SCOTT CARD
CTRL F BOOK OF THE NEW SUN

LAAAAME
GREAT LIST I WOULD ADD ENDERS GAME TO THE LIST GREAT BOOK IMO
WOW I READ THREE OUT OF THE SEVENTEEN BOOKS LISTED THERE
NUMBER WILL BLOW YOUR MIND S
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GENRE CHANGING YOU'RE MISSING SOME CRUCIAL WORKS HERE
THE MAD SCIENTIST AS POPULARIZED BY DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE
2 THE LAWS OF ROBOTICS LAID DOWN BY ASIMOV IN ROBOT SERIES IT'S BEEN SOME TIME SINCE I READ FOUNDATION BUT I DON'T THINK IT HAD REFERENCES TO THE LAWS OF ROBOTS
THE STRUGGLE TO DIFFERENTIATE REALITY AND ILLUSION IN MULTIPLE PHILIP KING DICK BOOKS LIKE VALID OR MAN IN HIGH CASTLE
THE IDEA THAT MACHINES CAN EMOTE THINK DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHIP
CHINA PERDIDO STREET STATION BLEW MY MIND WHEN I READ IT I WISH MORE PEOPLE GAVE IT A TRY IT'S A TOUGH READ IN SOME WAYS BUT A GOODNESS OF PROPORTIONS
I'D VOTE FOR THE WOOL OMNIBUS
IT HIT ME RIGHT IN THE FUTURISTIC APOCALYPTIC SCI-FI
I LOVED LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA I NEVER WANTED IT TO STOP PROBABLY MY FAVORITE OF WORKS AND I HAVE READ OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY VOYAGES
DUNE IS A BRAIN TWISTING MEMORY GAME BUT I STILL LOVE IT YOU NEED A CHART TO KEEP IT ALL STRAIGHT DIDN'T THEY HAND OUT CARDS TO MOVIEGOERS SO THEY COULD KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING
MANY PEOPLE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT LEM SHOULD BE HERE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE NAME I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS GENRE CHANGING BUT I THINK FEW PEOPLE KNOW HIM AND MANY WOULD ENJOY READING HIS BOOKS
WIKI


CHEERFULLY OMITTING FRANKENSTEIN WHICH ARGUABLY STARTED IT ALL

ALSO DISTINCTLY LACKING PK DICK BESTER FARMER
HOW ABOUT THE WINDUP GIRL INSTEAD OF WIND-UP GIRL I MEAN THE COVER WITH THE CORRECT TITLE IS RIGHT THERE
NO STANISLAW LEM IS JUST SILLY

SOLARIS IS IMO THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THE SCIENCE FICTION GENRE BECAUSE IT CONCENTRATES ON HUMANITY'S LIMITATIONS MORE THAN ANYTHING IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN LIKE READING A PAINTING
CURIOUS WHY THE TIME MACHINE ISN'T ON THAT LIST
THANKS FOR SHARING THIS I HAVE TO ADD THESE TO MY EVER GROWING LIST OF BOOKS
THE GUY ON THE COVER OF THE FOREVER WAR LOOKS LIKE BIONIC JAMES FRANCO
GOOD LIST
SLAUGHTER-HOUSE FIVE SO HAPPY TO SEE IT ON HERE
I AM SO HAPPY TO SEE MARTIAN CHRONICLES ON THIS LIST IT'S MY FAVORITE AND I'M ALWAYS SO SURPRISED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT
H G WELLS AND OLAF STAPLETON
HOW IS WE ALWAYS LEFT OFF ALL THESE LISTS IT INFLUENCED A BRAVE NEW WORLD AND WAS THE START OF THE ANTI UTOPIAN BOOKS
DON'T KNOW HOW OFF OF POINT I AM BUT IT MUST BE MENTIONED THAT I BELIEVE KURT VONNEGUT IS TYPICALLY OVERLOOKED IN THE SCIFI WORLD IN THE LIT WORLD HE'S APPROPRIATELY RECOGNIZED FOR HIS VOICE AND HIS NUANCE AMONG SCIFI CRITICS IT SEEMS THAT HE'S DISMISSED OR UNWELCOMED I WOULD THINK THAT HE WOULD FIND A SHELF ALONGSIDE RAY BRADBURY BEFORE JD SALINGER WHEREAS BRADBURY HAS GOTTEN HIS RECOGNITION VONNEGUT REMAINS AN ANOMALY AND DIFFICULT TO CLASSIFY I'VE NEVER GONE INTO SCIENCE FICTION TERRITORY I'VE SEEN IT AS THE REALM OF PIRATE GNOMES AND D D WITH SIDED DIE BUT VONNEGUT PULLED ME IN AND I'M BETTER FOR IT HE WOULD NEVER BE A HG WELLS BUT HIS WORLDS ARE SUBTLY IMAGINED FROM MICRO TO MACRO HIS ACTORS ARE SCIENTIFICALLY FANTASTIC IN THEIR INSIPID ROUTINE VONNEGUT IS THEREASON I'VE ATTEMPTED ANYTHING LIKE DUNE OR PHILIP DICK BUT SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT MY VOTE GOES TO I AM LEGEND RICHARD MATHESON
HERE'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION AS AN ASPIRING WRITER WHO HAS READ A LOT BUT NONE OF THESE SHOULD I READ THEM OR SHOULD I ALLOW MY BIASES AND INSPIRATIONS TO BE OUTSIDE OF THESE BOOKS
ENDYMION DAN SIMMONS
I JUST FINISHED READING ULYSSES LITERALLY 2 DAYS AGO TOOK ME A LONG ASS TIME AND I ENJOYED IT BUT IT WAS TOUGH MAYBE I'LL READ THIS SINCE I LIKED ULYSSES
FOUND THIS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND EARLIER VERSION OF THE LIST THAT ALSO INCLUDES FANTASY
NO COME ON MANUAL
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY MENTION OF BRAVE NEW WORLD I'D SAY THAT WAS AS INFLUENTIAL AND GROUND BREAKING AS ANY OF THEM
I DON'T KNOW DAHLGREN IN FACT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT DELANEY AT ALL LOOKING AT HIS WORK I'VE ONLY READ CITY OF A THOUSAND SUNS AND FOR ARTHUR C CLARKE I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE PUT ON THE LIST INSTEAD OF END
COMMENTING SO I CAN LOOK AT THIS LATER
YOU'RE TELLING ME THE DOOR INTO SUMMER DIDN'T MAKE THE LIST

ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS READ THAT LOVELY LITTLE TALE ABOUT TIME TRAVEL
STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND IS MOSTLY ABOUT HOW THE MAIN CHARACTER IS GREAT AT FUCKING
I WAS REALLY UNDERWHELMED BY THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES THE FORMAT SEQUENCE OF DIARY NEWS ARTICLE TYPE PASSAGES WAS A COOL AND GOT ME EXCITED INITIALLY BUT WHAT BRADBURY DID WITH IT SEEMED TO LACK ANY COHESIVENESS OR INTERESTING THEMES AND THE PSEUDOSCIENCE UNDERPINNING ALL THE TECHNOLOGY CAME OFF TOTALLY DETACHED FROM ANY UNDERSTANDING OF BASIC PHYSICS EVEN OF HIS TIME IN THE END IT MOSTLY SEEMED LIKE A NONSENSICAL FILLER OF A BOOK TO ME

CLEARLY THE WORLD DISAGREES WITH ME WHAT DIDN'T I GET
I HATE TO BE ANOTHER WHY ISN'T X ON THE LIST GUY BUT

THE STARS MY DESTINATION BY ALFRED BESTER COME ON
THREE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS ARE ON HERE
SNOW CRASH IS A TOUGH READ IT WAS VERY GOOFY TO ME
SOMEONE PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I SEEM TO REMEMBER IT BEING ANNOUNCED YEARS AGO THAT RIDLEY SCOTT WAS PLANNING ON FILMING THE FOREVER WAR THEN I NEVER HEARD FROM THAT AGAIN
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT DAN SIMMONS IS NOT REPRESENTED HERE AFTER READING CARL IN I NEEDED SOMETHING TO BUILD ON ITS ACCELERATING COMPLEXITY OF THE COSMOS THAT WE ARE ALL MADE OF STAR STUFF POINTED TO SIMMONS DID THIS IN AND GRANTED HE WON THE HUGO AWARD FOR HIS PREVIOUS WORK HYPERION CANTOS BUT THE IDEAS PRESENTED THERE ONLY REALLY CAME TO FRUITION IN THE LATER WORKS
THE FOUNDATION TRILOGY IS AMAZING IM GLAD IV READ THEM A YEAR AGO ALSO A BRAVE NEW WORLD IS A MUST READ
NOT A BAD LIST OF SF BOOKS BUT THE SCHOLARSHIP IS COMPLETE GARBAGE

FOR EXAMPLE IT CLAIMS THAT THE FOUNDATION FROM GREG BEAR GREGORY BENFORD AND DAVID BRING HELPED LAUNCH THEIR CAREERS ALL THREE OF THEM WERE BESTSELLING AUTHORS AND HAD BEEN FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
WHERE'S JG BALLARD
DIANETICS BY LR HUBBARD
THIS PERFECT DAY BY IRA LEVIN SHOULD BE ON THE LIST IT'S AN AMAZING BOOK
JOE HALDEMAN GETS ALL THE POINTS READ EVERYTHING HE HAS WRITTEN IT'S SF WITH A SOUL
ALAS BABYLON

JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'M SURE THERES MORE


I WILL READ OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL THEY BUILD THAT HYPERSPACE BYPASS
I'VE TRIED TO READ STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND BUT COULDN'T GET INTO IT AFTER THE FIRST OR SO PAGES I'M ASKING ANYONE WHO HAS READ IT IS IT WORTH GOING BACK TO
I FEEL LIKE I M MISSING SOMETHING ABOUT THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS I READ IT A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND REALLY DON T UNDERSTAND ITS IMPACT AND POPULARITY NOT TRYING TO START SHIT JUST NEVER HAD THE BENEFIT OF DISCUSSING THE NOVEL WITH SOMEONE
COMMENTING
LOVE SEEING WIND UP GIRL ON HERE THAT BOOK IS SO RAW AND I JUST LOVE WHEN A BOOK SO EFFECTS ME THAT I DON'T EVEN CARE IF IT HAS FLAWS OR NOT
ENDERS GAME
WHAT ABOUT GAME
FRANKENSTEINS MONSTER WRITTEN IN BY MARY SHELLEY IS SOMEHOW NOT ON THIS LIST AND NEEDS TO BE IT'S BASICALLY THE FIRST SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL HAVING COME OUT NEARLY YEARS AGO AND IT'S STILL VERY PRESENT IN POP CULTURE
I'M SO HAPPY THAT FOREVER WAR IS ON HERE
DELETED
I HAVE JUST ABOUT ALL OF THEM HITCH HIKERS GUIDE SUCKED IMO THE FOUNDATION AND THE TRILOGY WAS GREAT A FEW I HAVEN'T READ AS THEY SEEM TO BE MORE IN THE REALM OF FANTASY

I AM SURPRISED THERE ARE NONE BY PHILLIP JOSE FARMER
REMOVED
I'M STRUGGLING TO SEE WHAT ABOUT THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS CHANGED THE GENRE DO THEY JUST MEAN THAT IT WAS A FAIRLY GOOD BOOK WRITTEN BY A WOMAN AT A TIME WHEN ALMOST NO WOMEN WROTE SCIENCE FICTION
MEDIOCRE CLICK BAIT HITCH HIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY REALLY
ACCORDING TO THE BBC

THE FOUNDATION SERIES HELPED TO LAUNCH THE CAREERS OF THREE NOTABLE SCIENCE FICTION AUTHORS OF THE SUCCEEDING GENERATION JANET ASIMOV SANCTIONED THESE NOVELS WHICH WERE PUBLISHED IN THE LATE FOUNDATION'S FEAR BY GREGORY BENFORD FOUNDATION AND CHAOS BY GREG BEAR AND FOUNDATION'S TRIUMPH BY DAVID BRIN

RUBBISH THOSE WRITERS WERE CHOSEN BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY WELL-ESTABLISHED AUTHORS IN SCIENCE FICTION THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE THREE B'S OF SCIENCE FICTION A DECADE BEFORE THE SECOND FOUNDATION TRILOGY WAS EVEN CONCEIVED

AND NO I ROBOT THAT'S A TRAVESTY IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR BOOKS THAT'S A PRIME CANDIDATE BEFORE ASIMOV ROBOTS WERE PRIMARILY DEPICTED AS BERSERK MACHINES WHO REBELLED AND ENDANGERED THEIR CREATORS A LA FRANKENSTEIN ANOTHER SHAMEFUL OMISSION ASIMOV SINGLEHANDEDLY REINVENTED ROBOTS AND MADE THEM INTO TOOLS AND MACHINES RATHER THAN MONSTERS

WHERE THE FUCK IS GAME
WHEN I SEE A LIST LIKE THIS BUT NO ONE IS LISTED MORE THAN ONCE I GENERALLY THINK IT'S A COMPLETELY BULLSHIT LIST THIS IS NO EXCEPTION
ANYBODY IN HERE EVER HEARD OF J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN
WHY ISN'T STAR WARS ON THE LIST
ONE WOMAN ONE BLACK MANUAL AND IS SAMUEL ROYAL DELANY THE ONLY GBT PERSON ON THIS LIST MORE LIKE A LIST THAT MADE BIG CHANGES IN SF THAT STILL AVOIDED MAKING WHITE MEN THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT THEIR PLACE IN SOCIETY EVEN THOUGH SF IS A GREAT PLACE TO DO THAT
I THOUGHT I WAS TRIPPING FOR SEEING NICOLE KIDMAN IN THAT IMAGE
AS I RECALL FROM SCHOOL HE BUILT A FIRE USING A WOLF
AND NOT A SINGLE WORD ABOUT THE IRON HEEL
I LOVED STORIES BEFORE I KNEW IT WHITE FANG WAS MY FAVORITE FILM GROWING UP HAD NO CLUE WHO THE AUTHOR WAS OR THAT THE MOVIE WAS BASED ON A BOOK WHEN I GREW OLDER I AVOIDED BOOKS LIKE THE PLAGUE BUT CALL OF THE WILD REMINDED ME OF WHITE FANG SO MUCH I DOVE RIGHT IN IT WAS MY FAVORITE BOOK FOR SEVERAL YEARS
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE HIS BOOKS ON THE READING LIST IN POVERTY-STRICKEN NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY IN CLASSROOMS WITH A LOT OF KIDS WHO HATE READING THEY MIGHT LIKE THOSE BOOKS OPPRESSION BULLYING RISING ABOVE ETC PLUS THEY ARE JUST EXCELLENT ADVENTURES
WALL
THE BOOK IS EXPLICITLY WRITTEN TO CONVEY A FEELING OF CONFUSION TO ALIGN WITH WHAT THE CHARACTER IS GOING THROUGH YOU SHOULD PROBABLY JUST KEEP READING IT RATHER THAN STARTING OVER IT ISN'T MEANT TO BE ENTIRELY COHERENT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW
DEVOTE AS MUCH TIME AS YOU CAN TO GET THROUGH SECTION IN ONE SITTING LET THAT MARINATE FOR A WHILE THEN REREAD THAT SECTION MAKE NOTES IN THE MARGINS IF YOU NEED TO AND REMEMBER THAT BENJY DOESN'T RECALL TIME IN THE PAST SENSE LIKE THE TYPICAL NARRATOR DOES HE DESCRIBES EVERYTHING IN THE PRESENT TENSE SO IN ONE MOMENT HE'S IN THE PRESENT DAY BUT THE NEXT HE'S RECALLING A MOMENT FROM HIS CHILDHOOD AND THERE IS NO DISCERNABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE TENSES IN NARRATION IT TAKES A BIT OF WORK TO GET TROUGH THAT BUT IT'S VERY REWARDING ONCE IT CLICKS TRY TO CREATE A ROUGH TIME LINE IN YOUR HEAD OF LIFE AND USE THE BIG MOMENTS AS MARKERS DON'T BE AFRAID TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE LOST THAT'S TYPICAL AND PART OF THE EXPERIENCE

SECTION IS EVEN HARDER AND I'D TRY TO READ THAT ONE A COUPLE TIMES THROUGH AS WELL NOT NECESSARILY ALL IN ONE SITTING BUT UNDERSTAND HE IS A CONFUSED YOUNG MAN AND HIS STRUGGLE IS CENTERED ENTIRELY AROUND THE NOTION OF SOUTHERN NOBILITY AND HOW HE CAN RESTORE HIS FAMILY'S HONOR AFTER HIS SISTER IN HIS EYES SULLIED IT AGAIN DON'T BE AFRAID TO GET LOST AND CONFUSED

AFTER THAT THE JASON AND DILEY SECTIONS ARE MUCH MORE TYPICAL AND STRAIGHT FORWARD THE NOVEL CAN BE A STRUGGLE BUT JUST FEEL IT AND GO THROUGH IT A FEW TIMES ASK QUESTIONS OF THOSE WHO HAVE READ IT IF NEED BE BUT DON'T GIVE UP IT IS SO REWARDING AND WONDERFUL AT THE END ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE NOVELS GOOD LUCK
I FIND TYPICALLY HELPS ALLEVIATE MOST CONFUSION EVEN IF YOU DO IT IMMEDIATELY
DEFINITELY HELPS I'M READING IT THE SECOND TIME NOW AND KNOWING THERE ARE TWO QUENTIN FOR EXAMPLE MAKES IT MUCH EASIER I'M CURRENTLY WORKING OVER THE TEXT WITH A PENCIL BEING ACTIVE WHILE READING IS A GOOD WAY TO PROCESS THINGS
I ALSO TRIED TO GET THROUGH IT I GET THAT THE DISORIENTATION AND CONFUSION ARE INTENTIONAL BUT IF SOMETHING IS INTENTIONALLY DONE POORLY THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT GOOD YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE 2 CHARACTERS WITH THE SAME NAME DO THAT TO YOUR READER YOU FELT IT WASN'T CONFUSING ENOUGH AS IS

REGARDLESS MY LAST TRY WAS YEARS AGO SO MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TAKE ANOTHER STAB AT IT A LOT OF FRIENDS WHOSE TASTES I REALLY RESPECT CITE IT AS A FAVORITE
TAKE NOTES ON WHAT'S GOING ON ESPECIALLY WHERE YOU LEAVE OFFICIAL
MY FATHER IS ALWAYS TRYING TO GET ME TO READ THAT MAYBE I WILLIAM
YES IT'S EXTRAORDINARY THERE'S ALSO AN EQUALLY EXTRAORDINARY RADIO SERIES ADAPTED FROM IT STARRING KENNETH BRANAGH
THE THING I MOST REMEMBER FROM IT IS A FEELING OF WHAT IT IS REALLY LIKE TO LIVE IN A TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM IF AND THE LIKE ARE POWERFUL PARABLES THIS IS THE NATURALISTIC VERSION
YES ONE OF MY FAVORITES IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS BUT WHAT I RECALL TAKING AWAY FROM IT WAS THE LENGTHS PEOPLE WILL GO TO IN ORDER TO SURVIVE JUST ONE MORE DAY NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT I BELIEVE I ACTUALLY HAD TO TAKE A BREAK AT ONE POINT BECAUSE IT WAS STARTING TO GET TOO DEPRESSING
WHICH ONE IS THAT I THINK I'VE READ THEM ALL I HAVE BEEN GETTING HIM AND LINWOOD BARCLAY CONFUSED LATELY TOO
IS IT READABLE WITHOUT READING THE OTHER BOLITA BOOKS FIRST OR SHOULD I START WITH THE FIRST BOLITA BOOK
I GENERALLY READ THE LONELY PLANET GUIDE WHICH HAS TIPS ON HOW NOT TO GET ROBBED OR KILLED BY THE LOCALS
I JUST READ IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT I PICKED UP HIS BOOK ABOUT HIKING HE APPALACHIAN TRAIL CAN'T WAIT TO PICK THAT ONE UP
WHEN I BECAME A MAN I PUT AWAY CHILDISH THINGS LIKE THE FEAR OF CHILDISHNESS AND THE DESIRE TO BE VERY GROWN UP

I'VE EDITED OUT THE BIT THAT MAKES IT TOO LONG AND INCLUDED A SPOILER
IT IS OUR CHOICES THAT SHOW US WHAT WE TRULY ARE FAR MORE THAN OUR ABILITIES J KING BOWLING HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
MAGICIANS SERIES INITIAL PREMISE AND UNIVERSE WAS SO AWESOME GROWN UP HARRY POTTER BASICALLY UNFORTUNATELY NEARLY EVERY CHARACTER IS A HORRIBLE WHINY AND OR INTOLERABLE HUMAN BEING WHICH MAKES IT PROGRESSIVELY MORE DIFFICULT TO READ



EDIT ALSO CAN'T AGREE ENOUGH ON DIVERGENT SERIES LOVED THE UNIVERSE AND THE FIRST BOOK WAS PRETTY DECENT FOR YA BUT GOD DID THEY GET PAINFUL TO READ
THE WHEEL OF TIME IT GOT MORE AND MORE PAINFUL AS IT WENT ON BUT CROSSROADS OF TWILIGHT BROKE ME MANAGED TO FINISH IT BUT MADE IT LESS THAN PAGES INTO THE NEXT BOOK BEFORE I GAVE UP
THE SOOKIE STACK HOUSE BOOKS
THE DARK TOWER

THE GUNSLINGER WAS GREAT THINGS GET PROGRESSIVELY WORSE AND THEN WIZARD AND GLASS IS LEGITIMATELY AWFUL HAVEN'T BOTHERED WITH THE REST
HECK YES FOR THE YA NOVELS I LOVED ARAGON AS A KID AND WAS UTTERLY DISGUSTED BY HOW BAD THE LATER BOOKS WERE
IT NEVER HAPPENED WITH YA NOVELS BUT THE ONLY TIME I GOT FIZZLED OUT IS WITH BY PAGES IN I START TO LOSE INTEREST IN THE BOOK AND I HAVE BEEN GOING ON AND OFF READING IT


NOT YA THE CENTURY TRILOGY BY KEN COLLET


STARTED OFF AS AN INTERESTING IDEA OF SEVERAL FAMILIES CAUGHT UP IN THE FLOW OF HISTORY IN THE FIRST BOOK THEN THE 2ND AND 3RD BOOKS INCREASINGLY DECAYED INTO CHARACTERS BEING FORCE MARCHED THROUGH EXPOSITION AND COINCIDENCES
GAME SERIES LOVED IT UP UNTIL CHILDREN OF THE MIND
GAME OF THRONES I TRIED IT BEFORE IT BECAME SUPER POPULAR AND GOT A TV SHOW IT WAS DECENT AT FIRST BUT THEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN FOR HUNDREDS OF PAGES AT A TIME THE WRITER ALSO HAD A BAD HABIT OF BUILDING UP TO A BIG CLIMACTIC SCENE CUTTING AWAY TO DRAGON GIRL WALKING ACROSS THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER CHAPTER THEN RETURNING THE DAY AFTER THE BIG SCENE AND EXPLAINING WHAT HAPPENED
WHEEL OF TIME SERIES UGGGGH
OUTLANDER SERIES I ENJOYED THE FIRST BOOK MADE IT THROUGH THE SECOND LISTENING TO THE ABRIDGED AUDIO BOOK FOR THE THIRD AND GAVE UP ON THE FOURTH BOOK AFTER ABOUT PAGES IN AND WE WERE STILL ON THE MORNING OF THE FIRST DAY

I TEND TO LIKE LESS DESCRIPTION AND MORE ACTION AND DIALOGUE AND THE AUTHOR LOVES TO GIVE LOTS OF DESCRIPTION AND DOESN'T LEAVE ANYTHING OUT JUDGING FROM HER POPULARITY I THINK IT'S HER TYPE OF WRITING THAT DOESN'T WORK WITH ME
SO DISAPPOINTING I FELT THAT WAY ABOUT THE HUNGER GAMES AND ALL THAT YOU MENTIONED AS WELL I THINK IT'S BECAUSE YA FICTION REALLY BLEW UP THE PAST FEW DECADES AND ESPECIALLY AFTER HARRY POTTER AND THEY WERE MAKING SO MUCH MONEY THEY JUST STARTED THROWING CONTRACTS AT PEOPLE


SOME SUGGESTED AUTHORS WITH ACTUALLY GOOD YA WORK

AMORA PIERCE

NAOMI NOVAK

KRISTEN BRITAIN GREEN RIDER SERIES

JOHN GREEN

GARTH NIX







I REALLY GOT INTO THE COSMETE WITH NOVELS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY INTOXICATING AT FIRST AND TO BE FAIR ALL OF HIS NOVELS ARE JUST SO GOOD HOWEVER READING THEM IN SUCCESSION JUST PROVED TO BE TOO MUCH AFTER A WHILE AND I NEEDED A REPRIEVE OR I WOULDN'T KEEP ENJOYING THEM ANYMORE I THINK THAT IS WITH ANY KIND OF SERIES THOUGH IF I DON'T VARY UP THE GENRE STYLE I STOP ENJOYING IT
IAIN MCEWAN ATONEMENT
HYPERION 3RD AND 4TH BOOK ARE TERRIBLE IMO
I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE GUIDE TO THE GALAXY SERIES AND HAVE FOUND THAT WITH EACH BOOK I ENJOY IT LESS
THIS IS GOING TO BE CONTROVERSIAL I'M SURE BUT NOW THAT I THINK OF IT HARRY POTTER THE FIRST FOUR NOVELS WERE INDEED QUITE MAGICAL FOR ME BUT BY THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX IT SEEMED TOO IN THE ADOLESCENT DRAMA OF THE CHARACTERS IN A WAY THAT WASN'T NEARLY AS APPEALING OR CAPTIVATING I ACTUALLY DIDN'T READ THE LAST BOOK THOUGH I DID CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PLOT THROUGH READING ONLINE SYNOPSES AND SPOILERS

THIS IS MUCH MORE OBSCURE BUT I ALSO REMEMBER A SERIES CALLED THE CLUES THAT SEEMED TO START OFF STRONG AND FIZZLE VERY QUICKLY CIRC MY MOM BROTHER AND I READ THE FIRST TWO I THINK BOOKS TOGETHER WITH GREAT INTEREST WHEN WE WERE PAST THE TARGET AGE BUT STOPPED ABRUPTLY AFTER THAT I CAN'T RECALL MEMORIES OF THAT WHOLE TIME ARE SOMEWHAT GIVEN OUR INTEREST IN THE DEBUT AND HOW SUDDENLY AND WONDER IF EITHER OF THEM EVEN REMEMBER THE SERIES AT ALL NOW WE CEASED READING THEM THERE BEEN SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T LIVE UP TO THE INITIAL EXPECTATIONS AT ALL I COULD BE WRONG WE JUST STOPPED READING THEM DUE TO I SUSPECT THAT HAD THEY BEEN TRULY STELLAR WE CONTINUED ANYWAY

YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIT MORE OF A I DIDN'T THINK THAT THE LATER BOOKS WERE WEAK AT ALL FROM WHAT I I THINK IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT THE SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS FELL INTO THIS PATTERN SOMEWHAT AS WELL UP UNTIL THE LAST COUPLE VOLUMES THE SERIES WAS AMAZING BUT I REMEMBER THE END BEING A BIT DISAPPOINTING AND NOT NEARLY AS SPELLBINDING AS ITS PREDECESSORS

THE ALEX RIDER SERIES STOPPED HOLDING ANY INTEREST FOR ME AFTER EAGLE STRIKE I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA WHY AS I DON'T REMEMBER THAT SERIES VERY WELL

I WONDER OP IF SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IS SOMEHOW INHERENT TO YA FICTION PERHAPS IT'S A MICROCOSM OF OUR LOSS OF CHILDHOOD INNOCENCE IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY ITSELF AS REFLECTED IN MANY INTERCONNECTED READER AS HAVING SHIFTING TASTES AS THEY MATURE THAT FALL OUT OF SYNC WITH THE TROPES OF YA THE LOSS OF THE INNOCENT WONDER OF THE CHARACTERS AS IT D EVOLVES INTO THE SUSPENSE DRAMA AND SIMULTANEOUSLY MORE PRONOUNCED SHARPER AND SIMPLER INNER CONFLICTS OF ADOLESCENCE AND MAYBE EVEN THE LOSS OF THE INNOCENCE OF THE AUTHOR IN A SENSE P PHONETIC WORDPLAY IS FUN AS THEY GROW WEARY OF THEIR CHARACTERS AND MUST FACE THE CHALLENGES OF WRITING THEM INTO OLDER VERSIONS OF THEMSELVES AS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED FACING MORE ARDUOUS AND COMPLEX DILEMMAS IN THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS ADULTHOOD EVEN WHEN READING YA AS ADULTS IN AN ADULT MINDSET I THINK THIS CAN HAPPEN AS WE RELIVE THAT CYCLE IN A PARTICULAR WAY ANOTHER MORE LIMITED LESS PROFOUND SPECULATION MIGHT BE SIMPLY THAT MOST YA AUTHORS SEEM TO LACK THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO ADAPT THEIR CHARACTERS AS THEY GROW UP LOSING STAMINA FOR WHATEVER REASON MAYBE BECAUSE IF THEY WANTED TO WRITE MORE CONSPICUOUSLY ADULT CHARACTERS AND WERE GOOD AT IT THEY GONE DIRECTLY INTO WRITING ADULT FICTION IN THE FIRST PLACE

I HAVE A STRONG FEELING THAT THE BEST YA SERIES THAT WOULDN'T FALL INTO THIS PATTERN WOULD BE THOSE THAT DON'T AS CLOSELY FOLLOW THE ARCHETYPAL STRICTLY LINEAR NARRATIVE BECAUSE I SUSPECT THOSE THAT DO ARE IN SEVERAL WAYS BOUND TO BE WEAKER TOWARDS THE END I FOR ONE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE MORE YA THAT SUBVERTS THAT IN MORE ORIGINAL WAYS IT'S PART OF WHY MUCH OF YA OVERALL PARTICULARLY THAT GEARED TOWARDS OLDER TEENS BORES ME THERE'S A TENDENCY TO END UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S AWKWARDLY TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE THEMES OF ADULT LITERATURE WITHOUT HAVING CHARACTERS AS INTERESTING OR DEVELOPED AND LACKING THE NUANCE OF ACTUAL GROWN-UP FICTION WRITING THIS ADOLESCENT PHASE OF CHARACTERS WITHIN THE TROPE IS HARD TO DO AND I THINK A LOT OF AUTHORS FRANKLY JUST LACK THE ABILITY TO DO IT WELL

I'M SURE MANY DISAGREE WITH ME BUT I THINK IT'S PRETTY TELLING THAT EVEN THE STRONGEST YA SERIES HARRY POTTER SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS SUSTAIN THE MAGIC INITIAL GLIMMER ALMOST ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THE VERY END BUT STILL IN SUBTLE WAYS ARGUABLY END UP REFLECTING THIS ARC OF QUALITY TOO

BUT YES I'VE NOTICED THIS A BUNCH ALSO THERE ARE MANY SERIES IN WHICH I READ ONLY THE FIRST BOOK LIKED IT BUT HAD NO DESIRE TO CONTINUE WITH CERTAIN ONES I REMEMBER THINKING WHY IS THIS EVEN A SERIES SO ANOTHER REASON EXPLANATION FOR THIS MAY ALSO JUST BE THE SHEER FINANCIAL MARKETING MOTIVE OF THE SERIES FORMAT THAT ADDS AN UNNECESSARY PRESSURE TO SERIALIZE EVERYTHING AND DRAW STORIES OUT PAST THEIR INTERESTING POINTS
THE ARAGON SERIES WAS LIKE THAT FOR ME BY THE TIME BOOK CAME OUT I WAS A BIT OLDER AND HAD LOST ALL INTEREST IN THE STORY NEVER FINISHED THE ALEX RIDER SERIES EITHER ASIDE FROM THAT THERE ARE A FEW BOOKS I'VE INTENTIONALLY READ AS A EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE IN A SERIES SUCH AS GAME
I'M GONNA GET SO MUCH HATE FOR THIS BUT THE LAST OR DISCWORLD NOVELS BY TERRY PRITCHETT WERE A CHORE RATHER THAN A PLEASURE I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH RAISING STEAM THE WRITING STYLE WAS ALMOST UNRECOGNISABLE AS TERRY
ARTEMIS FOWL I'M SURE THAT THE QUALITY HASN'T DROPPED BUT BY THE TIME I STARTED HIGH SCHOOL I GREW OUT OF THEM
GAME DEFINITELY FIRST TWO BOOKS WERE OUTSTANDING STARTING TRAILING OFF STARTING WITH THE THIRD I WAS DONE WITH IT AFTER READING CHILDREN OF THE MIND
DIVERGENT FOR ME I'M IN LOVE WITH THE FIRST BOOK BUT THE REST CAN GO TO HELL
CAN I SUBMIT A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS THE PREMISE THE STYLE OF WRITING THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST SO PROMISING BUT SNICKET JUST DID NOT KNOW HOE TO MAKE A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION TO THE SERIES HE WANTED TO PILE UP MYSTERY ON MYSTERY BUT WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE IT WILL ALL LEAD
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO GOT BEYOND PAGE OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS EDITION BUT DIDN'T ACTUALLY REACH THE END

IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO NOW
THE SUE GRAFTON ALPHABET MYSTERY SERIES

I LOVED IT AT FIRST THEN SHE SWITCHED TO THIS SPLIT FORMAT WHERE CHAPTERS ALTERNATE ABOUT THE PI KINSEY MILLHON VERSUS A CHAPTER ABOUT THE POINT OF VIEW

I READ ALL THROUGH TO U IS FOR UNDERTOW AND I STOPPED I LIKE OLD FASHIONED STORIES LIKE THE EARLIER BOOKS SHE IS UP TO X NOW

IT HAPPENED TO ME WITH A WRINKLE IN TIME I LIKED THE FIRST BOOK THE 2ND ONE WAS OKAY BUT STRETCHED OUT TOO MUCH AND THE 3RD ONE WAS BORING ME AND WAS HARD FOR ME TO FINISH THE OTHER 2 I NEVER STARTED MANY WATERS AND AN ACCEPTABLE TIME
THE SHADOW SERIES BY ANTHONY RYAN BLOOD SONG WAS LEGITIMATELY ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ BOOK TWO WAS A FUCKING MESS HE WENT FROM A SINGLE POV WITH A STRONG NARRATIVE TO MILLION POV WITH NO COHERENT STORY IT'S LIKE THEY WEREN'T EVEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME PERSON AND IT BROKE MY HEART I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH BOOK
STEPHEN ROYAL THOMAS COVENANT SERIES

THE FIRST THREE PRETTY GOOD

SECOND THREE EH

THE FINAL FOUR OH MY GOD WHAT IS HAPPENING
I HAVE TWO

KIM STANLEY MARS TRILOGY ABSOLUTELY STELLAR FIRST BOOK I'D ALMOST CALL IT SPECULATIVE POLITICAL FICTION BUT I COULD ONLY GET HALFWAY THROUGH THE THIRD BOOK BEFORE I QUIT

DUNE I'M GOING TO GET SO MUCH HATE AGAIN THE FIRST IS A DAMN MASTERPIECE BUT I JUST COULDN'T GET THROUGH CHILDREN OF DUNE
DRESDEN FILES I'VE READ ALL OF THEM AND I STOPPED CARING BY ABOUT BOOK SEVEN DDK IF BUTCHER WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING MORE TIME BETWEEN BOOKS BUT THE WORLD OF HARRY DRESDEN SEEMS VERY SHALLOW AND

MISBORN SPOILERISH I STOPPED READING WITH ABOUT PAGES LEFT IN BOOK VIN EXPLAINING WHY SOMEONE SHOULDN'T HAVE KILLED SOMEONE ELSE BECAUSE NOW SHE HAS NOTHING LEFT AND IS GONNA WHOOP ASS WAS THE EXPOSITIONAL CREAM OF THE CRAP I ENJOYED THE FIRST BOOK BUT THE REST DID NOT LIVE UP AND I ESPECIALLY DISLIKED HOW ALOMANCY WORKED THROUGH TEXT PUSHING PULLING KEEPING TRACK OF METAL LEVELS FLARING BLAH BLAH BLAH


AS A YA AUTHOR SOME YA ACQUISITIONS EDITORS REALLY LIKE TO BUY SERIES WHEN THE IDEA WAS PERHAPS BETTER FOR A SINGLE PITHY BOOK
SWORD OF TRUTH IT BASICALLY STARTED TO REPEAT ITSELF OME AND OVER AGAIN
TERRY SERIES WIZARD'S FIRST RULE WAS FUN AND HAD SIGNS OF ORIGINALITY NEXT 2 WERE OK TOO THEN IT WAS JUST COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLSHIT PAINFUL PAGES OF DIATRIBE ABOUT SOMETHING OR OTHER THEN PAGE OF PLOT
DEBORAH HARKNESS THE ALL SOULS TRILOGY THE FIRST 2 BOOKS WERE GREAT AND REALISTIC IN A WORLD WHERE NOBODY BELIEVES IN WITCHES AND VAMPIRES AND THEY SUDDENLY APPEAR IN THE LIFE OF A SCHOLAR THEY TREAT THE SUBJECT WITH THE EXPECTED AMOUNT OF SKEPTICISM AND IN THE THIRD BOOK SUDDENLY THE PROTAGONIST IS TRAVELLING THROUGH TIME AND HAS A FAMILIAR AND IS PREGNANT WITH A VAMPIRES BABY I COULDN'T GET PAGES INTO THE BOOK IT WAS REALLY A DISAPPOINTING TURN

DID ANYONE ELSE HAVE A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WITH THE DEBORAH HARKNESS BOOKS
I CAN ABSOLUTELY SEE THIS I ONLY INCLUDED HIM CAUSE I WAS TRYING TO THINK STRICTLY YA AND MOST OF MY YOUNG ADULT READING WAS AMORA PIERCE AND THEN A BIG JUMP TO EPIC FANTASY STARTING WITH PIERCE ANTHONY AND ANNE MCCAFFERY THEN INTO TERRY GOODKIN ROBERT JORDAN JACQUELINE CAREY SANDERSON MARTIN ETC SO IT WASN'T EXACTLY YOUNG ADULT IF I WAS GOING TO ADD TO THIS LIST I'D ADD EARNEST CLINE ARMADA AND READY PLAYER ONE AND A FEW OTHERS I CAN'T NAME OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'M A HUGE FANTASY LOVER BUT I'VE BEEN READING AND FOR SO LONG I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IS AND ISN'T YA
THE JESSICA DARLING SERIES BY MEGAN MCCAFFERTY I ENJOYED THE FIRST FEW BOOKS BUT SLOWLY IT BECAME LESS ABOUT JESSICA THE INTERESTING CHARACTER AND MORE ABOUT HER NEVER SHUTTING UP ABOUT MARCUS THE GUY AND I DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THE FIFTH BOOK AT ALL
SEVEN-EYES
HIS DARK MATERIALS FIRST BOOK WAS GREAT A FUN ADVENTURE FULL OF IMAGINATIVE CHARACTERS AND PLACES SECOND BOOK WAS STILL GOOD BUT LESS FUN THIRD BOOK WAS MPH WITH SOME OK PARTS AND A LOT OF PARTS THAT WERE AN ABSOLUTE SLOG IT ALSO BECAME EXTREMELY HEAVY HANDED AND SOME REALLY UNSATISFYING CHARACTER ENDINGS
HAS ANYBODY SAID ARTEMIS FOWL YET BECAUSE I FOUND IT TO BE GODAWFUL TOWARDS THE END

THE CHARLIE BONE SERIES WAS ANOTHER THAT I JUST LET GO OF

I'M REALLY SURPRISED ABOUT ALL THE AMORA PIERCE LOVE THOUGH SHE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS GROWING UP AND I FEEL LIKE HEARD OF HER EXCEPT ONLINE
THE FIRST REVELATION SPACE BOOK WAS SO GOOD BUT AFTER THE WEAK FOLLOW UP BOOKS I'M DONE WITH ALASTAIR REYNOLDS
THIS WAS VERY MUCH THE CASE FOR ME WITH THE ANITA BLAKE VAMPIRE KILLER SERIES BY LATRELL KING HAMILTON IT STARTS OUT VERY STRONG IS GREAT FOR THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR NOVELS THEN DESCENDS INTO NOTHING BUT PORNOGRAPHY IN THE LATER NOVELS THERE ARE LONG SCENES FIFTY SIXTY PAGES LONG OF PERVERTED SEX AND GUESS WHAT IT'S BORING EVEN IF YOU SKIP SKIP SKIP OVER THE SEX THE LATER NOVELS AREN'T AS GOOD AS THE EARLY ONES THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF A STORY I CAN'T BEGIN TO CONVEY TO PEOPLE HOW GREAT THIS SERIES IS FOR THE FIRST FEW NOVELS AND HOW TERRIBLE AND UNREADABLE IT IS FOR THE REST OF THE SERIES
NOT SO MUCH A SERIES OVERALL BUT A BUNCH OF BOOKS IN THE SAME UNIVERSE BUT MIDKEMIA REALLY FIZZLED OUT UNTIL THE FINAL BOOKS
THE MAISIE DOBBS BOOKS I REALLY ENJOYED THE FIRST FEW BUT THEY STARTED TO GET REALLY TEDIOUS THE MOST RECENT ONE THAT CAME OUT I LISTENED TO ON AUDIO AND COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW INSUFFERABLE I FOUND THE MAIN CHARACTER TO BE SUCH A BUMMER BECAUSE THAT WAS A BOOK SERIES THAT MY GRANDMOTHER AND I BONDED OVER WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT
A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS
HOUSE OF NIGHT
IT STARTED AS A REALLY INTERESTING STORY BUT IT KEPT REPEATING PLOT LINES AND THE CHARACTERS NEVER LEARNED FROM THEIR MISTAKES
DEFINITELY THE SHADOW HUNTERS SERIES I WAS REALLY INTO IT FOR THE FIRST THREE BOOKS AND AFTER THAT IT WAS LIKE CLARE JUST THREW PLOT ELEMENTS INTO A PLOT AND HOPED SOMETHING GOOD WOULD COME OUT
AND NOW SHE HAS LIKE THREE OTHER VERSIONS OF THE SERIES IT'S JUST TOO MUCH
UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN I'VE STARTED IT THREE TIMES GOTTEN REALLY INTERESTED AFTER THE FIRST PAGES AND THEN BECOME SO UNINTERESTED AFTER THE NEXT PAGES THAT I CANNOT PICK IT BACK UP
THE HONORVERSE WAS THAT WAY FOR ME THE FIRST BOOK WAS GREAT AND THEN IT JUST KEPT GETTING WORSE I THINK I MADE IT TO LIKE BOOK BEFORE GIVING UP
HONOR HARRINGTON SERIES BY DAVID WEBER THE SUPPRESSED MENTAL GRINS DROVE ME NUTS
WAYWARD PINES SERIES IS ONE I CAN THINK OF BOOK WAS GOOD BUT HAD SOME FLAWS TOWARDS THE END BOOK 2 WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT BOOK WAS ONE OF THE WORST I'VE READ THIS YEAR I'M SURE BLAKE CROUCH REALISED HOW SHORT THE BOOK WAS GOING TO BE SO HE THEN ADDED A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT POBS THAT REALLY DIDN'T ADD ANYTHING NEW FOR ME THAT THE FIRST TWO BOOKS HADN'T DONE ALREADY TOPPING IT UP WITH THE LONG DRAWN OUT PLOT OF THE THIRD BOOK BUT WAIT THERES MORE CROUCH DECIDED TO LEAVE US A MOTHER OF A CLIFFHANGER
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A NAME BUT LETS CALL THEM THE DARK HEAVEN NOVELS BY KYLIE CHAN AMAZING AT FIRST BUT AFTER YOU LEARN ABOUT THE AUTHOR YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT THE BOOK IS ALMOST A FANTASIZED VERSION OF HER OWN ADVENTURES IN CHINA LETS NOT MENTION THE MAIN CHARACTER HAVING SEX WITH A GIANT GROTESQUE TURTLE THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOD
A WRINKLE IN TIME IS GREAT SO I OFTEN PRETEND THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES DON'T EXIST BECAUSE THEY'RE SO MUCH WEAKER
REMOVED
ASOCIAL
THE HUNGER GAMES MOCKINGJAY IS WORTHY TO BE DISOWNED IF YOU ASK ME TWICE THE SIZE OF THE FIRST BOOK AND A QUARTER OF THE QUALITY AS FAR AS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND PLOT YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE THE SHOCK DEATHS NO LONGER SHOCK YOU AND YOU'RE JUST PISSED OFF THAT COLLINS APPARENTLY FORGOT HOW TO WRITE

EDIT AND THEY MADE THAT ONE TWO MOVIES THAT MADE THINGS WORSE
THE FIRST BOOK IN UGLIES WAS SO GOOD AT THE TIME THE PLOT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE I HAD EVER READ AND THE PREMISE WAS AWESOME I OWN ALL BOOKS BUT ONLY COULD GET THROUGH 2 AND A HALF

DIVERGENT ALSO STARTED OUT WELL AT THE TIME DYSTOPIAN NOVELS WERE BECOMING MORE POPULAR AND SHOWING UP EVERYWHERE I WAS ABLE TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH THE SERIES WITH THE HOPE THAT IT WOULD PICK UP THE MIDDLE NOVEL IN A TRILOGY NEVER SEEMS TO BE AS GOOD AS THE FIRST AND THIRD BOOKS IN ANY TRILOGY I'VE READ AND JUST ENDED UP DISAPPOINTED AGAIN THE PREMISE AND THE FIRST BOOK WERE GREAT BUT THE SUBSEQUENT BOOKS JUST DIDN'T HOLD UP

I ALSO COULDN'T GET PAST BOOK OF A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS BECAUSE EACH BOOK WAS BASICALLY A CLONE OF THE LAST IN A DIFFERENT SETTING THE NEW NETFLIX SERIES DOES LOOK PROMISING SO I'M WILLING TO GIVE THAT A CHANCE
IS THERE A WAY TO BREAK THE SPINE I KNOW IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE BUT SOMETIMES WITH TOO LARGE BOOKS YOU CAN JUST BEND THEM UNTIL THE SPINE BREAKS AND IT WILL LAY OPEN
I HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH SOME MUSIC BOOKS AND USE CLOTHES PINS TO KEEP THE PAGES OPEN MAYBE A USED MUSIC STAND AND CLOTHES PINS WILL WORK FOR YOU
I PROP THEM UP AGAINST RODENTS OF UNUSUAL SIZE
THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I PREFER BOOKS BUT WHEN I HAVE TO READ AN AWKWARDLY SHAPED BOOK I SOMETIMES LAY SOMETHING HEAVY AGAINST THE PAGES TO KEEP THEM OPEN IF I'M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH MY HANDS MY PHONE WORKS WELL
USING A BOOK STAND IS A GAME CHANGER FOR TEXTBOOKS SEARCH FOR WOODEN BOOK STAND OR SIMILAR IT PROPS UP BIG HEAVY BOOKS AT A MORE NATURAL VIEWING ANGLE SO THAT HALF THE TEXT ISN'T TWICE AS FAR AWAY AND YOU HAVE TO CRANE OVER YOUR DESK TO SEE IT ALSO REDUCES THE FOOTPRINT ON THE DESK SO THAT THERE'S MORE ROOM TO PUT YOUR NOTEBOOK MAKES THE READING EXPERIENCE MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE
THEY DO THAT SO YOU'LL BREAK THE SPINE AND MAKE IT WORTHLESS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET SAVES THEM FROM SHUFFLING TWO CHAPTERS AND CALLING IT A NEW EDITION
BUY A KINDLE
WHEN I'M LAZY I TAKE PICTURES ON MY PHONE
TRY FINDING IT IN A DIFFERENT FORMAT


OR CUT THE PAGES OUT AND GLUE THEM INTO A LARGER BLANK BOOK
IF I CANNOT HOLD IT COMFORTABLY I USE A TABLE OR FLAT SURFACE OR MY KNEES FOR A TEXT BOOK BUT WHEN SITTING I STILL HOLD A PAGE SHAKESPEARE ANTHOLOGY IN MY LAP SO NO PROBLEMS YET
FAIRLY SURE THIS JUST READS AS YOU THINK YOU'RE SMARTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE

YOU'RE NOT

NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO BE SMUG AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY TO NOT USE A BOOK THAT'S PAGES TOO LONG AND FILLED WITH ONE DIMENSIONAL CHARACTERS SPOUTING LONG ORATIONS THROUGHOUT AN IDIOTIC PLOT LINE YES I'VE READ IT IT SUCKS ASS
CONSIDERING OPS POST AND COMMENT HISTORY AS PART OF EVALUATING WHAT'S BEING ASKED AND CONSIDERING THE IMPLICIT BIAS INHERENT IN PREJUDGING A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT CHOOSE TO READ WHAT OP IS SUGGESTING FOR WHAT ARE ASSUMABLY THEIR OWN PERFECTLY VALID REASONS WHY NOT JUST STATE YOUR JUDGEMENT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED MILLENNIAL RATHER THAN PHRASE IT AS A QUESTION
I'M NO CONSISTENT USER OF R BOOKS BUT ISN'T THIS A VIOLATION OF RULE 2 PLEASE USE A CIVIL TONE AND ASSUME GOOD FAITH WHEN ENTERING A CONVERSATION
THIS GUY IS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO GET A RISE OUT OF PEOPLE
DO MILLENNIAL HAVE ENOUGH PATIENCE TO TOLERATE TOTAL IDIOCY AND PISS POOR WRITING
I'VE READ IT COULD YOU HAVE THE RESPECT OR AT LEAST THE CIVILITY TO NOT TREAT ME AS YOUR INFERIOR THEN MAYBE WE CAN CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION THANKS
HAVING THE PATIENCE TO READ AND I MEAN REALLY READ A PHILOSOPHICAL NOVEL OF ROUGHLY PAGES

I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ATLAS SHRUGGED
I'M AND I SAY THAT YOUR COMMENT IS COMPLETE BULLSHIT YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY OVERCOMPENSATING FOR SOME PERSONAL FLAW AND FEEL THAT BY OOZING POMPOSITY THOSE AROUND YOU WILL ADMIRE YOU THEY WON'T
A T FIRST I WAS HAPPY TO BE LEARNING HOW TO READ IT SEEMED EXCITING AND MAGICAL BUT THEN I READ THIS ATLAS SHRUGGED BY AYN RAND I READ EVERY LAST WORD OF THIS GARBAGE AND BECAUSE OF THIS PIECE OF I'M NEVER READING AGAIN

OFFICER BARBRADY A CHARACTER WRITTEN BY TWO GEN
DON'T BLAME SHORT ATTENTION SPANS FOR PEOPLE NOT WANTING TO READ HAM FISTED CRAP

THEY BURN THROUGH THE WHEEL OF TIME OR GAME OF THRONES AND A LOT STILL EVEN READ THE BIBLE WHICH HAS SOME INTERESTING STORIES ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO AS
WE READ THE DECAMERON FOR FUN WHAT'S A THOUSAND PAGES OF AYN RAND
IF I WANTED TO READ SOMETHING SO POORLY WRITTEN SMUGGISH HYPOCRITICAL MISINFORMED AND BORING ILL JUST GO TO BRIETBART INSTEAD
DO BABY BOOMERS HAVE ENOUGH HUMILITY TO ADMIT THAT MILLENNIAL ARE NOT THE CARICATURES THEY DESCRIBE THEM AS
IF YOU GOT IT I'M SURE SOME IF THEM WILLIAM
AYN RAND WAS A DRUG ADDLED AMORAL SOCIOPATH THE PEOPLE COMPRISING THE ARYN RAND INSTITUTE PUBLISHING HER BOOKS ARE IDIOTS THEY COLLECT DONATIONS AND THEN GIVE AWAY HER BOOKS AT COLLEGES HOPING TO TRICK YOUNGER PEOPLE IN TO EMBRACING OBJECTIVISM

OBJECTIVISM LITERALLY TAUGHT THAT IT'S IMMORAL TO HELP OR LOVE OTHERS WITHOUT PERSONALLY BENEFITING FROM IT THAT ALTRUISM IS EVIL THAT HUMANS SHOULD NOT WORK FOR OTHERS AND IF THEY DO THEY ARE MAKING THEMSELVES SACRIFICIAL OBJECTS PLACING THE LOVE FOR ANYTHING ABOVE ONES SELF IS IMMORAL IF A PERSON IS WEAK THEY DO NOT DESERVE TO BE LOVED SHE SPOKE OUT AGAINST MAJORITY VOTING SHE PREACHED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO RIGHT TO TAX THE PEOPLE AND THEREFORE PROVIDE ANY SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OR SOCIAL SECURITY SHE WAS AGAINST ALL FORMS OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION

SHE CLAIMED SHE WAS BRINGING A NEW MORALITY UPON THE WORLD

SHE ARGUED THAT SMOKING WAS HARMLESS AND THAT CLAIMS TO THE CONTRARY WERE PROPAGANDA WHEN SHE DEVELOPED CANCER SHE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY FOR THE TREATMENT SO IN A COMPLETE REVERSAL SHE HAD THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR HER TREATMENT

JESUS WHAT A FUCKED UP PHILOSOPHY AND WHY WOULD ANYONE PROMOTE SUCH DISGUSTING TRASH
IT SUCKS AS FAR AS LONG BOOKS THAT ARE CONSIDERED DIFFICULT I MUCH PREFERRED BEOWULF READING THE ORIGINAL OLD ENGLISH ALONG WITH IT WAS A GREAT ADDITION

SINCERELY

YEAR OLD FINISHING 2 DEGREES SIMULTANEOUSLY WHO HAS READ BOTH FOR DISCUSSION BASED CLASSES AS IN IF YOU DON'T READ THE BOOKS ASSIGNED AND AREN'T ABLE TO HAVE AN INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION ABOUT IT YOU FAIL
WHAT IF I TOLD U THERE WAS A BETTER USE FOR MY TIME
S BABY CURRENTLY PLOWING THROUGH WAR AND PEACE WE READ LONG BOOKS BUT ONLY IF THEY DON'T SUCK
I'VE READ IT I AM A MILLENNIAL I HATED IT PREFERRED INFINITE JEST
THAT BOOK IS LARGELY DERIDED AND SEEN BY MANY IN BOOK COMMUNITIES AS CLAPTRAP FLAWED SILLY NONSENSE THE SMUG ATTITUDE BECAUSE YOU READ THE BOOK DID YOU THOUGH REALLY AND YOU LIKED IT'S ALL SO OBVIOUS LIKE A BOARD BOOK FOR THE TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS CLASS IS MOSTLY EMBARRASSING GROW UP AND PARTICIPATE BETTER
I THINK THE REAL QUESTION IS WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO READ ATLAS SHRUGGED WOULD IT ENRICH YOUR LIFE IN ANY WAY NOT SUPPOSED TO BE AN ENDURANCE TESTAMENT IF YOU'RE NOT ENJOYING IT AND YOU'RE NOT LEARNING ANYTHING FROM IT YOU WILL EVER USE THEN WHY BOTHER
ATLAS SHRUGS OR WHY BEING A SELFISH ASSHOLE IS JUSTIFIED
YOU SEEM LIKE THE TYPE OF PERSON TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS WORK ETHIC WHILE VOTING TO FUCK OVER THE YOUNGER GENERATION AT EVERY POSSIBLE TURN
I FEEL BAD FOR YOU OP THAT YOU WANT TO FEEL BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE
I'D RATHER WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT IN NETFLIX
I AM OVER I HAVE THE PATIENCE TO READ ANYTHING AND HAVE OVER THE YEARS

THERE ARE MANY PHILOSOPHICAL NOVELS OF MORE SUBSTANCE THAT I'M SURE MILLENNIAL READ

YOU TALK ABOUT PATIENCE TRY THE MALAYAN BOOKS I KNOW MILLENNIAL READ THEM AND IMO THAT IS THE EPITOME OF PATIENCE

I DON'T KNOW WHAT GENERATION YOUR FROM BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO STOP GENERALIZING AND ACTUALLY TALK TO INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE ON REDDIN I FOUND OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY I WAS OLD ON THIS SITE
I TRIED AND IT WASN'T DUE TO BOREDOM THAT I STOPPED IT WAS BECAUSE AYN RAND IS A DISGUSTING EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN BEING AND HER PHILOSOPHY IS DISGUSTING AND OFFENSIVE
ALSO THE WAY YOU'RE TARGETING MILLENNIAL HERE IS A LITTLE BIT OFFENSIVE UGH I FUCKING HATE OLD PEOPLE
MILLENNIAL RUIN EVERYTHING
WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO
HOW 2 READ ATLAS SHRUGGED

TAKE HAMMER

2 SMASH REPEATEDLY INTO FRONTAL LOBE

HOPEFULLY YOU WILL HAVE DAMAGED YOUR OWN THINKING PROCESSES ENOUGH TO READ ATLAS SHRUGGED
IF IT'S A SERIES OF TWEETS SURE
DO MILLENNIAL HAVE ENOUGH ATTENTION SPAN TO READ ATLAS SHRUGGED

YES THEY JUST DON'T NORMALLY CARE FOR THE CAPITALIST VERSION OF SHADES OF GREY
I READ IT AND I WISH I HADN'T
AT LEAST A HANDFUL IN MY CAPITALISM CLASS LAST YEAR
WELL AS A MILLENNIAL LAST WEEK I THOUGHT I MIGHT READ IT BEFORE I PICKED IT UP AND SAW THAT IT HAD AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF PAGES WITH WHAT SEEMED LIKE T FONT BIBLE TEXT IMMEDIATELY DROPPED THAT SUCKER WITH A NOPE
SOME OF YOU WENT WAY OVERBOARD HERE WE GET IT YOU FOLKS DON'T LIKE AYN RAND WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR ABOUT IT EVERY CHANCE YOU GET THIS CLUELESS POST SHOULD HAVE DIED WITHOUT A SINGLE COMMENT
IT'S REALLY WEIRD HOW FULL OF BILE PEOPLE ARE OVER AYN RAND AND EVEN WEIRDER HOW EAGER THEY ARE TO OVER HER SHIT IT'S BIZARRE HOW LITTLE SEEM TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH IT VINDICATES HER ARGUMENTS
WELL I GUESS MY QUESTION GOT ANSWERED


WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL ACSE BOARD WE WERE TAUGHT A SHAKESPEARE PLAY AND A BOOK THAT WAS A COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES THAT WAS A COLLECTION OF SOME GREAT CLASSIC SHORT STORIES I THOUGHT THAT WAS FUN I READ HARRY POTTER FOR FUN ANYWAY NOT SURE HOW I THINK ABOUT SCHOOLS TEACHING THESE BOOKS
MY 10TH GRADE ENGLISH TEACHER TAUGHT THE HOBBIT HE MADE IT INTO A TWO OR THREE MONTH COURSE AND IN THAT TIME I LEARNED THE MOST ABOUT LITERATURE THAT I THINK I EVER HAD I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE DISREGARD THESE BOOKS WHEN IT COMES TO LITERARY MERIT BUT THEY'RE WONDERFUL CLASSICS THAT I BELIEVE SHOULD HAVE A PLACE IN THE CLASSROOM
I THINK THE HOBBIT IS A GOOD CHOICE IT HAS SOME GOOD THEMATIC ELEMENTS WITH EXCELLENT STORYTELLING WHAT WITH BILBO GOING ON AN EPIC QUEST GROWING AS A PERSON OVERCOMING GREED ETC EXAMINING WRITING CAN REALLY SHOW YOU HOW CREATE AN ENGAGING STORY I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HARRY POTTER I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE BOOKS AND I DON'T THINK I'M CAPABLE OF DOING A BETTER JOB THAN BOWLING BUT SOMETHING ABOUT PRESENTING THEM IN A CLASSROOM DOESN'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME I GUESS AS LONG AS IT ISN'T PRESENTED AS A CLASSIC WORK IT'LL BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL CREATIVE WRITING
I THINK THE HOBBIT IS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE
FOR ANYONE CONFUSED THESE BOOKS WON'T BE FOR THE ACSE BOARD EXAMS THE 10TH RACE FINAL EXAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS GRADES WILL BE
I REMEMBER BEING TAUGHT STUDYING THE HOBBIT AND THE LORD OF THE RINGS IN SCHOOL IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF FANTASY LITERATURE FOR KIDS TO LEARN FROM HARRY POTTER THOUGH I ENJOY HARRY POTTER BUT THE WRITING IS PRETTY WELL BASIC IT'S NOT REALLY CHALLENGING WHATSOEVER WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY AT LEAST SOMEWHAT NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE USEFUL TO LEARN FROM
TURN TO PAGE SERIOUSLY
WHILE IT'S GOOD THAT KIDS ARE BEING GIVEN BOOKS THEY CAN ENJOY I DON'T KNOW IF THESE BOOKS WILL PARTICULARLY BROADEN ANY HORIZONS OR HAVE MUCH WORTHY OF STUDY IN THEM WHICH IS NOT A COMMENT ON THEIR QUALITY
WE HAD HOBBIT IN SCHOOL YEARS AGO IN POLAND
JUST TO NOTE GUYS THIS IS NOT IN THE UK US BUT INDIA SO THE ENGLISH THEY'RE LEARNING WILL BE THEIR 2ND LANGUAGE I AGREE LEARNING CLASSICAL LITERATURE IS MORE IMPORTANT AT THAT LEVEL BUT AS A SECONDARY LANGUAGE I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE TO BE TEACHING HARRY POTTER AND OR THE HOBBIT
MUCH BETTER THAN READING ABOUT SOME ANCIENT CRAP THAT CHILDREN CANNOT RELATE TO IT CAN HELP THEM ANALYZE AND DISCUSS WRITING CRITICALLY INSTEAD OF BLINDLY READING SOME CLASSICAL STORIES THAT ARE FRANKLY NOT SO GREAT EITHER
THIS WILL PROBABLY RUIN ONE OF THE BEST CHILDREN'S BOOKS BY FORCING KIDS TO READ IT
HOW OLD ARE THESE KIDS I REMEMBER READING THE FIRST HARRY POTTER IN SCHOOL WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY THE BOOKS WERE STILL NEW AND A HUGE HIT AT THE TIME SO MOST KIDS WERE READING THEM ANYWAY I THINK IT IS A GREAT WAY TO GET KIDS INTERESTED IN READING WE WOULD TALK ABOUT THE BOOK AND SOLVE SIMPLE TASKS ABOUT IT TO PRACTICE READING COMPREHENSION I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN AS INTERESTED IF IT WAS A RANDOM COLLECTION SHORT STORIES
AND I JUST FINISHED MY ACSE EXAMS

WELL SOUNDS GOOD I GUESS PEOPLE SHOULD ALSO FIGURE OUT MODERN LITERATURE AS WELL
I THINK THIS IS GREAT MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW WHERE MY ENGLISH CLASS IS QUITE ADVANCED IS THAT READING SHOULD BE FOR ENJOYMENT BECAUSE A YEAR IS TOO SHORT AND MOST KIDS ARE TOO UNINFORMED TO BE DISCUSSING THE NUANCES OF WHAT MAKES A GOOD BOOK CHILDREN NEED TO BE GOTTEN INTO READING SO THAT THEY CAN DEVELOP THOSE SKILLS OVER TIME NOT BE EXPECTED TO HAVE THOSE SKILLS WHILE READING BOOKS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE SHAKESPEARE

JUST FOR CLARITY MY SCHOOL HAS HAD GR S READING THE HOBBIT FOR A LONG TIME ALREADY AND I AM NOT FROM THE US OR UK
IT WASN'T THE TRASH THAT GOT SHOVED DOWN MY THROAT IN SCHOOL THAT GAVE ME A LIFETIME LOVE OF READING IT WAS HARRY POTTER I ACTUALLY GOT FORCED TO READ THE FIRST BOOK AS A PUNISHMENT FOR SOMETHING THAT TOTALLY WASN'T MY FAULT AND I WAS HOOKED STRAIGHT AWAY

FROM A CRITICAL POINT OF VIEW I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM HARRY POTTER THE WAY K WRITING ABILITY IMPROVES AS THE SERIES GOES ON IS SOMETHING THAT HAS ALWAYS FASCINATED ME AS A WOULD-BE WRITER

NOT COUNTING KINGDOM BY MICHEAL MURPURGO WHICH I WAS FORCED TO READ IN SCHOOL AND LOVED SO MUCH IT WAS THE FIRST BOOK I BOUGHT WITH MY OWN MONEY
I REMEMBER THAT WE READ THE HOBBIT IN MY FRESHMAN YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL IN WORLD LITERAL I ALSO WENT TO A BOARDING SCHOOL SO I ASSUME THAT WASN'T THE NORM I REMEMBER LOVING IT AND BEING WAY MORE INTO READING SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAN WHEN WE READ ROMEO AND JULIET SNOOOOOORE
MEANWHILE BACK IN THERE WERE HARRY POTTER BOOK BURNINGS BECAUSE OF TEACHING AND WITCHCRAFT TO CHILDREN AT LEAST WE'VE MOVED PAST THAT HURTLE
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE
GOOD JOB INDIA
GOOD I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME THAT LITERARY SNOBS GET A KICK IN THE BUTT THE PROBLEM WITH LITERATURE IS THE SAME AS IN MANY OTHER ACADEMIC ARENAS THE PEOPLES OPINIONS THAT MATTER ARE SCHOLARS WHO ARE SO STEEPED DARE I SAY INDOCTRINATED BY THE TIME THEY ACHIEVE THEIR HIGHER DEGREES THAT OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO SPIT OUT THE SAME OLD RHETORIC IT'S THE CLASSIC FEEDBACK LOOP

OKAY IT'S ONE THING IF IT'S A LITERATURE CLASS BUT MOST LITERARY BOOKS WERE ASSIGNED IN ENGLISH CLASSES SPEAKING AS AN AMERICAN KIDS SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO ALL TYPES OF BOOKS NOT JUST ONES THAT PEOPLE THINK OF LITERARY VALUE
HERE IN CBS BOARD WE HAD TO READ THE INVISIBLE MAN AND CARTERVILLE GHOST I HATED THEM SO MUCH
TSH THE ONLY GOOD THING INDIAN SCHOOLS HAVE COME UP WITH
AS A CBS STUDENT ONCE I ALWAYS KNEW THE ACSE TO BE BETTER
THE SUREST WAY TO SUCK THE JOY OUT OF READING GENRE BOOKS IS TO ASSIGN THEM AS HOMEWORK BUT THIS IS ME SPEAKING FROM MY AMERICAN SCHOOL EXPERIENCE KIDS IN INDIA MAY HAVE A REALLY DIFFERENT IMPRESSION ABOUT THIS OVERALL IT SOUNDS COOL IN THEORY
WELL I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THEM ARE STUNNING EXAMPLES OF THE LANGUAGE BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM IT'S EASY TO GET KIDS TO READ THEM AND THE FLAWS ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED SO IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ME
AS A CHILD I'D RATHER HAVE READ THESE BOOKS THAN THE SHAKESPEARE AND OTHER CLASSIC BOOKS THAT I WAS FORCED TO READ I HAD NO INTEREST IN SCHOOL BOOKS BUT OTHER MORE MODERN BOOKS I ENJOYED ITS TIME THE TEACHERS GOT THEIR ASSES KICKED AND WERE FORCED TO UPDATE THE MATERIAL INSTEAD OF RELYING ON MATERIAL INHERITED FROM PREVIOUS TEACHERS
WE READ THE HOBBIT WHEN WE WERE IN 7TH GRADE YRS OLD AT MY SCHOOL IN 6TH GRADE WE HAD TO READ A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POINTS AND IT WAS WORTH PART OF OUR GRADE OUR TEACHER HAD A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF BOOKS THAT WERE ALL WORTH A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF POINTS BASED ON COMPLEXITY AND LENGTH YOU THEN TOOK A QUIZ AND GOT THE POINTS BY PASSING THE FIRST HARRY POTTER BOOKS WERE AVAILABLE AT THE TIME SO MOST PEOPLE READ THOSE
MY 4TH GRADE TEACHER TAUGHT THE HOBBIT HOWEVER I WAS IN A CLASS WHO'S READING COMPREHENSION LEVEL WAS HIGHER THAN MOST IN THE DISTRICT IT CREATED A REAL INTEREST IN READING FOR ME

THAT SAME YEAR WE ALSO DID A MIDSUMMERS NIGHTS DREAM AND HAMLET WHICH EVEN AT THAT AGE I ADORED SO I'M STILL ALL FOR TEACHING SHAKESPEARE BUT MAYBE NOT IN SPADES AS IT SEEMS TO HAVE A TENDENCY TO DISCOURAGE THE MANY

I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO ENSURE THAT THE AGE LIMITS ARE SET APPROPRIATELY BASED ON THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS AND I THINK THEY HAVE DONE THAT HERE

SORRY ABOUT FORMATTING
MOST OF US BRITISH KIDS READ OF MICE AND MEN
FIRST BOOK I EVER READ IN ENGLISH WAS HARRY POTTER IT INFLUENCED ME SO MUCH BACK THEN NOW I'M AN AVID READER I THINK READING THAT BOOK WHEN I DID I WAS CHANGED MY LIFE IT DEVELOPED A DEEP YEARNING FOR READING IN ME I LOVE THAT THEY'VE NOW INCORPORATED THIS INTO THE CURRICULUM ITSELF
WELL THOSE BOOKS WILL BE RUINED FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
WHILE I THINK IT'S FINE AND PREFERABLE TO USE POP FICTION TO ENGAGE READERS AT LOWER LEVELS AND BOTH POTTER AND THE HOBBIT ARE RIFE WITH ALLUSIONS AND THINGS TO ANALYZE I WOULDN'T EXPECT THEM TO ENGAGE ANYONE WHO HASN'T ALREADY FOUND FANTASY LITERATURE AND I WOULD EXPECT THE COMPULSORY READING OF SUCH BOOKS TO TURN OFF A LARGE SWATH OF STUDENTS LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAN COMPULSORY READINGS OF ANY OTHER GREAT BOOK
ONLY BOOKS I REMEMBER READING IN SCHOOL WERE THE GIVER THE WAVE ENDERS GAME AND THE GREAT GATSBY LOVED EVERY SINGLE ONE
I'M CONFUSED HOW DO YOU TEACH FICTION BOOKS
READING THEM ISN'T THE SAME AS TEACHING

NEVER MIND THE RIDICULOUSNESS OF HARRY POTTER BEING ON ANY CORBICULUM
HAVING MANDATED READING ALWAYS TOOK OUT THE FUN FOR ME AND I NEVER REALLY ANALYZED THEM WHEN I HAD TO READ CATCHER IN THE RYE I DIDN'T BOTHER TO LOOK AT THE SUBTLETIES OF IT BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE A CHORE SO I'M WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE HARRY POTTER BEING INTRODUCED TO THE CLASSROOM
HUH I REMEMBER IN MY GRADE AND ISC I HAD WUTHERING HEIGHTS TWELFTH NIGHT AND RANDOM BOOK OF POETRY KIDS THESE DAYS XD
I FREAKING FUCKING READ JULIUS CAESAR AND MACBETH FOR MY SCHOOL TIME ON TOP OF THAT IT WAS IN OLD ENGLISH
THE KEY IN TEACHING YOUTHS SHAKESPEARE IS PICKING THE FUN ONES
I KNOW HARRY POTTER WAS USED IN GENERAL ENGLISH CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL IN THE NETHERLANDS I DID A DIFFERENT PROGRAMME I THINK THEY HAD TO READ THE 7TH BOOK IN ENGLISH WHICH FOR A SECOND LANGUAGE SUBJECT I THINK IS FINE THEY ALSO HAD TO READ THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AND SOME BILL BRYSON SO AT LEAST THERE WAS SOME VARIETY
HARRY POTTER WORKS AS A BOOK FOR KIDS TO READ IN SCHOOL BECAUSE IT READS LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE IN THE SECOND GRADE LETTING THEM READ THE SERIES IS A GREAT WAY TO EXPOSE KIDS TO A STORY IN LANGUAGE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND VOCABULARY IS CHILDLIKE SO THEY COULD PROBABLY GIVE THEM ANY OF HER WORK AND IT WOULD BE EASY FOR THEM
LUCKY STUDENTS
BUT THE THING ABOUT ALL THE CLASSICS IS THAT THEY'RE TERRIBLE I CONSIDER MYSELF A PRETTY GOOD LITERATURE GUY MADE IT TO THE REGIONAL SPELLING BEE THREE TIMES BUT I JUST HATE THE CLASSICS HARRY POTTER IS WHERE IT'S AT
GREAT BOOKS MAY NOT BE VERY EDUCATIONAL BUT AT LEAST IT TEACHES KIDS TO ENJOY READING
I THINK THIS IS GOOD IN EVERY WAY I MEAN WHO'S REALLY GONNA BE BENEFITED FROM AN ANCIENT FORM OF ENGLISH IT'D ALSO BE EASIER FOR THE CHILDREN ESPECIALLY WHEN MOST CHILDREN WHO HAVE WATCHED THE FILM OR READ THE BOOK BEFORE HAND I STUDIED ACSE AND I FOUND IT LAME STUDYING THESE SHAKESPEARE PLAYS
I LOVE THE HOBBIT I DON'T THINK HARRY POTTER IS SO GREAT FOR TEACHING
THE HOBBIT BOOK IS SO GOOD AND THE MOVIE SO AWFUL WHY USE ART FROM THE MOVIE PUT A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH BEFORE I READ THE TITLE AND SAW WHAT SUB THIS IS
HARI RUNNING IN CORRIDOR SHOUTING PATRONDOM CHARMS DWINING HIS WAND
DELETED
I THINK THAT THE HOBBIT IS A GOOD CHOICE THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN FROM THAT IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING THE FANTASY GENRE RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM RELIGIOUS AND MYTHOLOGICAL ALLEGORY AND YOU CAN CONNECT IT TO THE HISTORY OF EUROPEAN FOLKLORE THAT TZOLKIN WAS KIND OF ORGANIZING AND TRANSLATING THE CANNON FOR

I AM A LITTLE UNEASY ABOUT HARRY POTTER BEING TAUGHT I ENJOYED IT WHEN I READ IT AS A KID AND I DO THINK THERE'S SOME LITERARY VALUE TO IT IN TERMS OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE BUT I DON'T THINK THE FIRST ONE IS PARTICULARLY COMPLEX AND I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD TEACH LATER BOOKS AS STANDALONE NOVELS THERE'S MORE TO READ INTO IN LATER BOOKS AS THEY BECOME MORE ABOUT THE VIZARDING WAR AND THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF STATE CORRUPTION SOME IDEAS ABOUT DEATH ETC BUT I CAN'T SEE HOW YOU CAN TAKE THE FIRST ONE BEYOND A LOOSE HEROES JOURNEY AND A VAGUE ALLEGORY

EDIT I THINK THESE WOULD BE MORE USEFUL LOWER DOWN THE SCHOOL SORT OF RANGE AT ACSE I REALLY FELT I NEEDED CHALLENGING BY SOME OF THE BOOKS I READ A LOT OF SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR MY GASES AND I REALLY DIDN'T FIND THAT MUCH TO ANALYZE LORD OF THE FLIES HOWEVER HAD LOTS OF LAYERS TO IT AND YOU COULD REALLY DIG IN SO I'M DEFINITELY NOT MAKING A CASE FOR OLD GOOD NEWER BAD
I STILL THINK SHAKESPEARE SHOULD BE TAUGHT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET CHILDREN READ SOME LITERATURE AND WE ALL SUFFERED THEY SHOULD TOO
DAMN THESE LUCKY ONES
IM FROM THE BIBLE BELT AND THIS WOULD NOT FLY OFTEN I HAD TEACHERS READ HARRY POTTER TO US YET WAS A STORY TIME AND NEVER BROKE IT DOWN INTO LITERARY CONTENT LIKE WE WOULD WITH SHAKESPEARE AND CLASSICS LIKE THE GREAT GATSBY AND ONE FLEW OVER A CUCKOOS NEST TRUTHFULLY I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WOULD BE TAUGHT IN A LITERATURE COARSE
SO DUMB NO SURPRISE THEY WORSHIPPED THE BRITISH AS THEIR GOD FOR A LONG TIME
DELETED
AS IF DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT ISN'T ALSO STORYTELLING
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY WOULD HAVE ARISEN AT THE EXACT SAME TIME IN HISTORY AS OUR SUPPOSED EVOLUTIONARY SWITCH AS A PURE COINCIDENCE MUCH MORE LIKELY WE ARE ADAPTING TO THE CHANGING OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
ONE FACT IS INDISPUTABLE WHATEVER THE FIGURES FOR BOOKS SALES EITHER IN PRINT OR DIGITAL FORM READING FOR PLEASURE HAS BEEN IN SERIOUS DECLINE FOR OVER A DECADE

I DISPUTE THAT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL IN THE MID PRETTY MUCH NOBODY I KNEW READ FOR PLEASURE AND I WAS IN THE CHESS CLUB TODAY IT WOULD BE ODD TO HEAR A KID SAY THAT HE HASN'T READ HARRY POTTER KIDS KNOW WHAT BOOKS ARE AND THEY'RE WILLING TO SIT THROUGH DOORSTOPPERS LIKE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX THEY JUST HAVE MORE OPTIONS

TELEVISION IN PARTICULAR HAS IMPROVED IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS A SHOW LIKE MAD MEN OR BREAKING BAD COULD NEVER HAD MADE IT IN THE ERA ANYTHING TOO CONTROVERSIAL OR DEMANDING WOULD ALIENATE VIEWERS SO THE NETWORKS PLAYED IT SAFE WITH SIMPLE AND PREDICTABLE PROGRAMMING I AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT TELEVISION CAN'T ENGAGE OUR VISUAL AND SPATIAL IMAGINATION LIKE TEXT OR AUDIO DO BUT I THINK IT'S A BIT SILLY TO SUGGEST THAT TV SHOWS AREN'T STORIES WHEN THOSE SHOWS ARE INCREASINGLY RELIANT ON STORY ARCS
EVOLUTION DOESN'T HAPPEN SUDDENLY BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES HOW SOME READ SO NO HUMANS ARE NOT EVOLVING BEYOND THE NEED TO TELL STORIES
THEY ALREADY KNOW WHERE THE FOOD IS

I DISAGREE PEOPLE HAVE INSTANT ACCESS TO FACTUAL INFORMATION BUT OTHER INFORMATION STILL HAS A NEED TO BE EXPLAINED THROUGH STORIES THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT CAN ONLY BE TAUGHT BY LIVING LIFE OR TAUGHT BY READING STORIES AS A SORT OF WAY TO SIMULATE LIVING LIFE STORIES GIVE GREATER UNDERSTANDING THAN JUST BEING PRESENTED WITH THE INFORMATION IN A SIMPLE FORM
I THINK WILL ENTIRE OEUVRE IS ABOUT HOW NOBODY BUYS HIS BOOKS
MAYBE THE BOOKS WHICH STUDENTS ARE OFTEN REQUIRED TO READ IN U SOUTH SCHOOLS ARE SEEMINGLY TOO BORING TO FOSTER PEOPLES INTERESTS IN READING BOOKS I REMEMBER HAVING TO READ HAVING TO READ THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA IN SEVENTH GRADE READING CLASS IT WAS A YAWN FEST I SUSPECT THAT IF THE TEACHER DID NOT HAVE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS AMOUNTS OF COFFEE THEN HE TOO WOULD HAVE BEEN YAWNING WITH THE SAME FREQUENCY THE STUDENTS WERE YAWNING AT I WAS TOTALLY PUT OFF BY BOOKS UNTIL THAT SAME SEVENTH GRADE TEACHER MADE ME READ A MYSTERY BOOK THE BODY OF CHRISTOPHER CREED THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH MY FIRST MYSTERY BOOK I HAD READ AT THAT POINT AND IT SPARKED SOME INTEREST INTO ME INTO THE MYSTERY GENRE UP TO THAT POINT IN TIME I HAD BEEN BASICALLY CONDITIONED TO DISLIKE READING

FROM THE LATTER SENTENCE IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH A THOUGH ARISES MAYBE PARENTS ARE READING LESS TO THEIR CHILDREN IF I HAVE CHILDREN AT SOME POINT I WILL LIKELY READ THE DISCWORLD SERIES TO THEM TO HOPEFULLY FOSTER THEIR INTEREST IN READING HARD TO GO WRONG WITH THE DISCWORLD SERIES

BY TYPING TOO BORING I DO NOT MEAN TO IMPLY THAT THE BOOKS WHICH STUDENTS ARE OFTEN REQUIRED READ TO IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL ARE BAD BOOKS FOR EXAMPLE THE ILIAD AND THE ODYSSEY BY HOMER CAN BE A BIT BORING OF A READ AT SOME POINTS IN THE STORIES BUT I THINK THE WRITING POSSESSES MANY GOOD QUALITIES
NOPE WE ARE NOW JUST TELLING STORIES THROUGH DIFFERENT MEDIUMS NAMELY DIGITAL ONES
WILL SELF IS ALSO JUST MAD NOBODY WILL READ HIS INTOLERABLE HIGH MODERNIST NOVELS AND FOR SOME REASON SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT ULYSSES WAS A BESTSELLER IN THE GOLDEN DAYS OF READING IN THE IN REALITY HE THINKS THE NOVEL IS DEAD BECAUSE HIS NOVELS ARE DEAD ON ARRIVAL HE'S DISCONNECTED FROM THE COMMON MANUAL
WILL SELF POSITS HUMANS ARE EVOLVING SO AS TO LEAVE TALES BEHIND THAT'S A COCK-AND-BULL STORY
FAHRENHEIT
WE ARE NOT EVOLVING OUT OF BOOKS NOR HAS ANY KIND OF CHANGE TO OUR BRAINS TAKEN PLACE IN OUR GENES AND LIKELY NEVER WILLIAM


BOOKS ARE A CREATION WE CAN LOOK BACK TO WRITING ON THE WALLS OF CAVES TO SEE SOME OF THEIR FIRST FORMS AT HEART THE PURPOSE OF THE BOOK IS TO CONTAIN INFORMATION TO PASS ON OR TO HOLD FOR LATER REFERENCE THIS HAS SHIFTED HUMANS FROM NEEDING TO HAVE STRONGER MEMORIES TO NEEDED TO HAVE STRONGER REACTION TIMES ETC SINCE WE DIDN'T NEED MEMORY AS MUCH NOW WITH TECHNOLOGY WE DON'T NEED THE BOOK THE CAVE WALL IS NOW THE MONITOR THE BOOK WAS MERELY A STEP THEY WILL SOON DIE OFF AS WE LEARN TO DEPEND ON COMPUTERS GOOGLE TO BE OUR BRAIN AS WE REALIZE EDUCATION HAS LITTLE VALUE IN A WORLD OF UNIVERSAL GOOGLE

WE NO LONGER HAVE THE NEED TO CONTAIN INFORMATION SO WE ARE LEARNING AND IMPROVING OUR PROCESSING OF STIMULATION
WHAT IF IT'S ALIENS
IT'S DUE TO LAZINESS SIMPLE AS THAT PEOPLE CONSIDER READING A CHORE THESE DAYS
WHY USE A HAMMER WHEN A DRILL GETS IT DONE IN A 4TH OF THE TIME
TECHNOLOGY IS CATCHING UP TO OUR DESIRE TO CONSUME WE JUST NEED BETTER WAYS TO INTERFACE WITH IT
LIKE VR
I WOULDN'T THINK YOUR AVERAGE BLACK FRIDAY SHOPPER WOULD BE OUT LOOKING FOR BOOKS
AROUND HERE AT LEAST MANY STORES ARE DOING SALES TOMORROW FOR SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY INCLUDING MY LOCAL BOOK STORE SO THAT'S COOL

SIDE NOTE WENT TO TARGET AND GAP AROUND NOON AND IT WAS PRETTY TAME I'M ON SICK LEAVE FROM WORK RETAIL MALL STORE AND MY CO WORKER SAID IT'S A SHIT SHOW SO I'M GLAD I MISSED THAT
WORTH MENTIONING THAT I WORK AT A BOOKSTORE AND WE HAD BLACK FRIDAY SALES TODAY AND IT WAS BANANAS WE HAD NEW RELEASES AND BEST SELLERS RATHER THAN THEIR USUAL OF ALL BOXED SETS OFF ALL MASS MARKET PAPERBACKS AND OFF ALL KIDS BOOKS PEOPLE WENT CRAZY FOR IT BUSIEST DAY OF THE YEAR AS IT IS FOR MANY BUSINESSES AND A HUGE SUCCESS

SO YES SOME BOOKSTORES RUN BLACK FRIDAY PROMOTIONS AND YES PEOPLE ARE OUT LOOKING FOR BOOKS ON BLACK FRIDAY
BRILLIANT
IF THE UK DOESN'T CELEBRATE US THANKSGIVING HOW IS BLACK FRIDAY A THING DO RETAILERS JUST ARBITRARILY SAY THE BEGINNING OF SHOPPING SEASON

THOUGH IT'S ALL ARBITRARY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
STUPID
THE WHOLE WEEKEND IS JUST CHAOS I'M JUST GOING TO SEQUESTER MYSELF WITH A BOOK WHILE THE MADNESS GOES DOWN AND I'LL DO MY BOOK SHOPPING SOME OTHER TIME
GOOD FOR THEM
REMINDS ME OF THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD BARBARIAN
BLACK FRIDAY SALES ARE TERRIBLE TO NON-EXISTENT FOR BOOKS SO THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA
A VERY GOOD IDEA SPEAKING AS SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED RETAIL AND SEEN HOW OVERZEALOUS PEOPLE CAN BE SHOPPERS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS LOOKING FOR GOOD ELECTRONICS HOME MEDIA DEALS NOT BOOKS SEPARATING BOOK SALES INTO A OF ITS OWN WILL GIVE MUCH MORE ATTENTION TO BOOKSTORES IN GENERAL
ARE THEY GONNA CLOSE ON FRIDAY WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL AND THE THANKSGIVING WEEKEND WAS THE FIRST BREAK OF THE SEMESTER I WOULD HEAD OUT TO THE BOOKSTORE ON SATURDAY AND IT LOOKED LIKE A TORNADO HAD HIT AND STILL NOT REALLY CIVILIZED TRYING TO BROWSE AMIDST ALL THE DEVASTATION
I'LL HAVE TO CAMP OUT IN FRONT OF THE STORE AND OFFER PEOPLE HOT BEVERAGES
I HATE SHOPPING ON BLACK FRIDAY BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY CHASE DISCOUNTS AS A RULE THE ONLY SHOPPING I EVER DO IS STUFF I REALLY NEED AND IT'S A HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS TO HAVE TO WADE THROUGH CROWDS OF PEOPLE I WISH THERE WAS SOME KIND OF EXPRESS LINE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR SOMETHING
BOOKSTORES CAN'T COMPETE DON'T PARTICIPATE IN BLACK FRIDAY MARKET IT AS LETTING THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE THE DAY OFFICIAL
BUY THINGS SPEND MONEY THEN DIE
SUPPORT INDEPENDENT BOOKSHOPS
I JUST GOT PEDRO PARAMO CHARLIE THE CHOO-CHOO FROM THE WORLD OF THE DARK TOWER MOTHER NIGHT ALL NEW EDITIONS FOR I DID THE MATH AND WITHOUT THE FREE SHIPPING DOLLAR DISCOUNT CODE MY TOTAL WOULD HAVE BEEN AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL USED BOOKS

DOES NOT MATTER LEE CHILD IS THE BETTER WRITER
YOU REALLY NEED TO PUT A SPOILER TAG ON THIS POST
THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK I READ BY GRAHAM THE HUMOR IN IT THE HEART OF THE MATTER IS NEXT ON MY LIST
THIS BOOK GOT ME INTO GRAHAM GREENE AND I DO LIKE IT A LOT BUT THE POWER AND THE GLORY IS MY FAVORITE SO FAR
BATMAN AND WONDERWOMAN THEY JUST MAKING THE SUPERFRIENDLY COMICS AGAIN
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I WANTED THIS
THEY OUGHTA DO A EQUAL TO RETURN OF THE CAPED CRUSADERS AND HAVE LINDA CARTER POP IN AS WONDERWOMAN
A FRIEND AND I USED TO READ A BOOK BEFORE SHARING LEAVE EACH OTHER NOTES THROUGHOUT THE BOOK IT WAS A LOT OF FUN I LIKE TO THINK IT WOULD MAKE A GOOD GIFT
IF THE COMMENTS WERE FUNNY OR INFORMATIVE OR EVEN JUST PLAIN NOTES IT COULD ADD TO THE READING EXPERIENCE

ONLY BUT IF I MAY SUGGEST YOU A BOOK TAKE A LOOK AT SOUTH BY DOUG DORST AND J J ABRAMS IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY IT'S A NOVEL THAT HAS A SECOND AND THIRD LAYER OF STORY THAT IS BEING TOLD THROUGH NOTES WRITINGS AND ITEMS LIKE LETTERS POSTCARDS AND PHOTOS ADDED TO IT BY TWO CHARACTERS WHO DID A BOOK EXCHANGE AND SWAPPED IT BACK AND FORTH WHILE ALWAYS ADDING NEW STUFF IT'S ALL FICTIONAL OF COURSE BUT IT REALLY FEELS LIKE IT COULD BE REAL ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE NOVEL LOOKS LIKE IT'S VERY OLD THE COMMENTS ARE IN HANDWRITING AND ALL THE GIMMICKS ARE REALLY WELL DONE

EXAMPLE PAGE

VERY COOL CONCEPT AND DEFINITELY SOMETHING DIFFERENT I ABSOLUTELY ENJOYED IT BECAUSE I ALSO LOVE READING OTHER PEOPLE'S NOTES IN OLD BOOKS
THIS BOOK MAY INTEREST YOU I LIKE THE IDEA OF SENDING SOMEONE A COPY OF A BOOK WITH YOUR THOUGHTS AND NOTES IN IT
I ALWAYS HOPE THAT THE USED BOOKS I GET ACTUALLY HAVE NOTES IN THEM TOO I ACTUALLY HAVE QUITE A FEW BOOKS THAT ARE NORMALLY ASSIGNED IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT HAVE NOTES IN THEM THE NOTES ARE PRETTY MUCH ALL GENERAL ANALYSIS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT GETTING IN A CLASSICAL I'VE WRITTEN IN A FEW BOOKS MYSELF BUT THEY'RE MOSTLY RANDOM COMMENTS AND JOKES THOUGH I LIKE THE IDEA OF A WRITTEN IN BOOKS BOOK SWAP
I BORROWED THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK FROM THE LIBRARY AND TWO DIFFERENT NOTE WRITERS HAD CONDUCTED AN EXTENSIVE ARGUMENT IN THE MARGINS ONE BEING VERY CRITICAL OF ANNE THE OTHER DEFENDING HER ACTIONS IT WAS ALMOST AS INTERESTING AS THE MAIN STORY
BUYING OLD WRITTEN IN DIARIES AND READING THEM IS FUN
NUMBER HELL NUMBER ABSOLUTELY NUMBER I DON'T WRITE IN MY OWN BOOKS AND I SURE AS HELL DON'T WANT SOMEBODY SCRIBBLING IN SOMETHING I'M BUYING
I'D BE DOWN I READ A LOT OF FICTION
I'D DEFINITELY BE DOWN FOR THAT I NEVER USED TO WRITE IN THE MARGINS OF MY BOOKS BUT COLLEGE COMPLETELY BROKE ME OF THAT HABIT NOW IT'S KIND OF FUN TO READ WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THOUGHT OF THE BOOK ESPECIALLY IF THEIR COMMENTS ARE SASSY
I LIKE WHEN THEY'RE IN MATHEMATICS TEXTS I WAS READING ELEMENTS AND THEY WERE ALL OVER MY COPY I WOULD LAUGH AT HOW RIDICULOUSLY STUPID SOME OF THEM WERE
I HATE IT SPECIALLY WHEN THE QUOTES IT'S ABOUT OBVIOUS STUFF LIKE X CHARACTER GOES TO Y PLACE
COMMENTS IN THE MARGINS ARE NICE IN REALLY OLD BOOKS BUT I LOVE INSCRIPTIONS I HAVE AN OLD COOKBOOK THAT HAS THE NAME OF THE OWNER HER ADDRESS AND THE DATE PENCILLED IN ON THE FIRST PAGE IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY FEEL A CONNECTION WITH A PAST READER OR BOOK OWNER
I DO NOT MIND BUYING BOOKS ANNOTATED BY SOMEONE ELSE AS LONG AS THE HANDWRITING ISN'T TERRIBLE WHICH FREQUENTLY IS IN FACT NOWADAYS I BUY ONLY USED BOOKS BUT I DON'T WRITE ON MY OWN BOOKS AND I HATE IT WHEN SOMEONE BORROWS A BOOK FROM ME AND WRITES ON IT
YOU SHOULD READ SOUTH BY DOUG DORST AND JJ ABRAMS HALF OF THE STORY IS TOLD THROUGH HAND WRITTEN NOTES IN THE MARGINS THAT TWO STRANGERS ARE WRITING TO EACH OTHER
I'VE ACTUALLY RECENTLY DISCOVERED THE WHOLE ANNOTATED BOOKS THING AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME OLD BOOKS WITH WRITING IN IT THAT I COULD PURCHASE I THINK IT'S A REALLY COOL IDEA TO SEE SOMEONE THOUGHTS ON THE BOOK I'D DEFINITELY BE DOWN
IT IS MY OPINION THAT IF YOU WRITE IN OR HIGHLIGHT A BOOK IT IS NOW YOURS FOREVER
AS A RULE I DON'T PURCHASE BOOKS USED OR OTHERWISE IF I FIND WRITING THROUGHOUT THE PAGES I HAD A SIGNED BIOGRAPHY THAT I FOUND AT A THRIFT STORE THAT HAD A SIGNATURE FROM THE AUTHOR ALONG WITH A LONG RANT FROM THE FORMER OWNER ABOUT HOW HER DEATH WAS AN INJUSTICE GOING INTO WAY TOO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT HER FADING MEDICAL CONDITION AND RELIGION

I'VE FOUND OTHER BOOKS USUALLY PENGUIN CLASSICS OR WORKS THAT HAVE SCRIBBLING AND NOTES PEPPERED THROUGHOUT ONCE IT'S AT THAT POINT THE BOOK IS USUALLY IN TOO POOR A CONDITION TO BUY IMO

THE ONE CAVEAT I HAVE IS IF I BUY A BOOK THAT HAS SOME SORT OF SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION PRESS RELEASES NEWS CLIPPINGS CHRISTMAS CARDS ETC TUCKED IN WITH A BOOK AT THAT POINT I KEEP IT AS A SET
I READ SIDDHARTHA IN 7TH GRADE AND IT COMPLETELY ALTERED THE COURSE OF MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER
I STARTED READING HARRY POTTER WHEN I WAS LAST BOOK CAME OUT WHEN I WAS CLOSE TO THE SAME AGES HE WAS IN THE BOOKS WE GREW UP TOGETHER

SOME RANDOM ROMANCE BOOK TARGETED FOR TEENAGE GIRLS

NOT KIDDING LOL I ACTUALLY GOT HOOKED BY IT OFC THE NEXT BOOKS I'VE READ ARE FAR FROM IT
SPHERE BY MICHAEL CRICHTON THE SUSPENSE AND CURIOSITY COMPLETELY ENGROSSED ME FOR A DAY
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED READING ANY AND EVERYTHING I COULD GET MY HANDS ON BUT ABSORPTION HAPPENED FOR ME THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS GIVEN THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA WHEN I WAS THEY GOT ME DEEPLY
FIRST EVER BOOK WAS DRACULA IT WAS FREE AND I GAVE IT A SHOT SINCE I LIKE VAMPIRES AND WHO DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT DRACULA I WASN'T EXPECTING MUCH BUT I WAS COMPLETELY ABSORBED INTO THE BOOK AND IT FINISHED BEFORE I EVEN KNEW IT IT HAD SOME SLOW AND DRAWN OUT MOMENTS BUT SOME PARTS OF THE BOOK ARE DEFINITELY ENGRAVED IN MY MIND AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT

BEFORE THIS I HAD READ MAYBE ONE OR TWO BOOKS AND THOUGHT OF THAT AS A CHORE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIND ENJOYMENT WELL DRACULA KICKED OFF MY LOVE OF READING AND AFTER WHAT SEEMS LIKE HUNDREDS OF BOOKS I HAVE NO INTENTION OF STOPPING
BELIEVE IT OR NOT FOR ME IT WAS VICTOR THE MAN WHO LAUGHS BIGGEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ AND I'M NOT AN AVID READER AT ALL IN FACT I'M A VERY CASUAL SLOW READER TO THIS DAY I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF SORCERY WAS IN ACTION
I IMAGINE IT WAS SOME KIDS BOOK I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW

I'M GETTING OLD

CHILD OF GOD BY CORMAC MCCARTHY I ORDERED IT WITH A BUNCH OF MCCARTHY BOOKS AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN THE MAIL I WAS SO PUMPED TO READ ONE IT'S A SHORT ONE AND I FINISHED IT THAT DAY I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN IT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MCCARTHY BOOKS AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN GENERAL
THE DAY OF THE JACKAL BY FREDERICK FORSYTH I STRUGGLED TO ENJOY READING UNTIL I PICKED THIS BOOK AT RANDOM FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOUR TEACHER TO GIVE YOU A BOOK BEFORE YOU READ ONE RIGHT
YOU'RE ASKING WOULD SOMEONE BE MORE LIKELY TO READ IF THEY LIKED THE SUBJECT MATTER

REGARDLESS OF SEX I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY EASY ANSWER
YOU DO REALIZE NOT ALL MEN AND BOYS ARE A HIVE MIND WHO LIKE ALL THE SAME THINGS
YOU DO REALIZE MOST CLASSICS ARE WRITTEN BY MEN MOSTLY FOR MEN AS FEMALE LITERACY IS A SOMEWHAT RECENT PHENOMENA RIGHT

PLENTY OF CLASSIC BOOKS ARE FILLED WITH ACTIONS COMPETITIONS VIOLENCE TRIALS THAT PROVE THEIR MATURITY AND MASCULINITY PIETY FATE IF THEY INVOLVED INNER JOURNEYS THEY ARE SYMBOLICALLY DEPICTED WITH EXTERNAL ACTIONS THINK HEART OF DARKNESS THINK HEMINGWAY THINK HOMER EPICS THINK GILGAMESH GOING AROUND PICKING FIGHTS THINK COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THINK ABOUT ALL THE SLAUGHTERINGS IN THE BIBLE THINK TOM SAWYERS AND HUCKFIN THINK DON QUIXOTE FIGHTING WINDMILLS THINK ARABIAN NIGHTS AND SLAUGHTERING WIVES UNTIL HE FINDS ONE WHO CAN TELL ENGAGING STORIES

CLASSICS AND VIOLENCE ACTIONS FORM CHARACTERS PLOTS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

ALSO PLENTY OF BOYS LIKE EMOTIONAL BOOKS IN FACT MANY MALES WERE SO MOVED BY THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER THEY COMMITTED COPYCAT SUICIDE IN DROVES DRESSED EXACTLY LIKE WERTHER EVEN NAPOLEON CONSIDERED IT ONE OF THE GREATEST WORKS OF EUROPEAN LITERATURE

I ALSO KNOW PLENTY OF MEN WHO ENJOY NOVELS THAT EXPLORE EMOTIONAL INNER EXPERIENCES THE FAVORITE AUTHORS THEY LIST ARE AUTHORS KNOWN FOR EXPLORATION OF HUMAN RELATIONS EMOTIONS SOCIAL CONFLICTS EROTICISM

MAYBE YOU'RE ONLY HANGING OUT WITH BOYS WITH SIMILAR TASTE
I DON'T LIKE THE DICHOTOMY YOU'RE GIVING EITHER IT'S INTERESTING FOR BOYS EITHER IT'S CLASSICAL AND YOU ASSOCIATE CLASSICAL WITH GIRLS FOR SOME REASON

GIVE BOYS THE THREE MUSKETEERS AND THERE'S A CLASSIC RIGHT THERE WITH A BUNCH OF MUSKETEERS SLAUGHTERING A BUNCH OF BAD GUYS

THERE'S DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLASSICAL YOU KNOW

YOUR QUESTION WAS JUST DOWNRIGHT LEADING YOU AGAVES BOYS THE CHOICE BETWEEN SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING AND SOMETHING NEUTRAL CLASSICAL COULD BE ANYTHING WHILE YOU GAVE GIRLS THE CHOICE BETWEEN SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE AND SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS NEUTRAL WELL OF COURSE GIRL ARE GOING TO PREFER THAT

I COULD ASK A SIMILAR QUESTION AND ASK MY FRIENDS WHETHER THEY'D RATHER READ A CLASSICAL BOOK OR A BOOK ABOUT A MYSTICAL ROMANCE WHERE THE GIRL FALLS IN LOVE WITH TWO GUYS AND BLABLA AND SUDDENLY MAGICALLY FIND OUT THAT BOYS PREFER CLASSICAL BOOKS WHILE GIRLS DON'T LIKE THEM AND MAYBE GIRLS WOULD READ MORE IF WE GIVE THEM THE MATERIAL THEY LIKE LOVE STORIES
I TRIED AND TRIED TO FIND BOOKS MY TWO SONS WOULD READ AND ENJOY BUT NOTHING WORKED ALSO I COULDN'T GET THEM TO SUGGEST ANYTHING AND THEY WOULDN'T SPEND ANY TIME BROWSING IN LIBRARIES OR BOOKSTORES

WHEN MY YOUNGEST SON WAS ABOUT HE GOT INTO A VIDEO GAME CALLED RAINBOW SIX I TOLD HIM I HAD THE BOOK THAT IT CAME FROM AND ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO READ IT HE SAID HE WOULD BUT HE NEVER DID
LOOK BASICALLY ANYONE WOULD LOVE A BOOK ABOUT MOTHERFUCKING LANDSKNECHT HAVING ADVENTURES

THIS ISN'T A THING ABOUT DIFFERENCES VIA SEX IT'S ABOUT LANDSKNECHT MOST CLASSICAL LITERATURE HAS A MASSIVE DEFICIENCY IN THE NUMBER OF STRIPED PANTALOONS AND ZWEIHANDERS INVOLVED
THERE ARE MANY BOOKS THAT GET ASSIGNED THAT HAVE ELEMENTS OF VIOLENCE AND KILLING MACBETH ROMEO AND SOME CHICK A FAREWELL TO ARMS EVEN THE GREAT GATSBY HAD PARTYING BOOZING CHEATING ALL ROUND AND TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS

BUT BOOKS ASSIGNED IN HIGH SCHOOL ARE NOT TO ENTERTAIN YOU THEY ARE TO TEACH YOU CRITICAL READING SKILLS SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND EVEN MORE COMPLEX BOOKS LATER IT'S NOT ABOUT EASY ENTERTAINMENT LIKE AN ACTION MOVIE IT'S LIKE NAVIGATING AN UNKNOWN LAND WITH JUST A FLASHLIGHT
GIVEN A CHOICE OF

GIVEN THE MATERIAL THEY LIKED

IF THEY GO TO THE LIBRARY THEY WILL BE GIVEN A HUGE CHOICE OF WHATEVER THEY MAY DESIRE

THEN BY CHECKING ONE OUT THEY ARE INDEED GIVEN THE MATERIAL THEY LIKED FREE OF CHARGE

MAYBE THEY JUST NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT LIBRARIES

THIS CAN BE DONE ONLINE IN MY CITY IT'S AT AND WAY EASIER TO BROWSE SUBJECT AUTHORS ETC THAN PHYSICALLY GOING TO THE BUILDING AND WANDERING THROUGH THE SHELVES BUT IF I EAST YOU DECIDE YOU LIKE SCIENCE FICTION IN GENERAL IT CAN BE USEFUL TO GO TO THOSE SHELVES AND LOOK UNTIL SOMETHING CATCHES YOUR EYE


THIS IS IN THE USA BUT MANY COUNTRIES MUST HAVE SIMILAR ACCESS

PAGE SOUTH WHEN I WAS LONG BEFORE ONLINE EXISTED I RODE THE BUS TO THE LIBRARY ON WEEKENDS NOW I CAN READ DESCRIPTIONS ETC FROM HOME AND TRY STUFF FOR FUN IF I DON'T LIKE ONE I CHECK IT BACK IN AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE

PAGE SOUTH SOUTH IF ON THE OTHER HAND YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE EXPOSED TO IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT MIGHT MAKE THEM INTERESTED OR NOT IN READING AT ALL TO BEGIN WITH THEN MAYBE GO TO YOUR SCHOOL LIBRARIAN AND HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH HER HIM IT MIGHT BE VERY HELPFUL AND LIBRARIANS IN GENERAL ARE VERY HELPFUL PEOPLE AND DEFINITELY WANT TO GET PEOPLE INTERESTED IN READING
FOAH FOAH SLOW DOWN PEOPLE LIKE READING BOOKS THEY FIND INTERESTING NO WAY
WOULD YOU BE MORE LIKELY TO RENT A MOVIE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE OR WOULD YOU RENT THE ONE YOU WANTED TO SEE


WOULD YOU ORDER THE FOOD OFF THE MENU THAT YOU THINK SOUNDS DISGUSTING OR WOULD YOU ORDER THE THING THAT SOUNDS DELICIOUS TO YOU


DO YOU WALK INTO A STORE AND SAY WOW I SHOULD BUY THAT IT LOOKS TERRIBLE


YES ANYONE REGARDLESS OF GENDER WOULD BE MORE INCLINED TO READ A SUBJECT MATTER THAT HE SHE FINDS INTERESTING
YOUR QUESTION SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT BOYS READ LESS FREQUENTLY THAN GIRLS
WHILE THAT MAY OFTEN BE TRUE IN YEARS I THINK IT'S GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT GIRLS EARLY ON TEND TO OUTPERFORM BOYS DEVELOPMENTALLY IN THE SHORT TERM THOUGH BOYS DO TEND TO CATCH UP IN THE END

A NUMBER OF STUDIES DO SHOW THAT WHEN CULTURAL BIASES AREN'T FORCED UPON THEM THAT THERE IS GREATER FLUIDITY IN GENDER PREFERENCE FOR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES UNFORTUNATELY WE SELDOM PROVIDE SUCH NEUTRAL ENVIRONMENTS WHICH IS ONE REASON THAT BOYS LEARN EARLY ON THAT DOLLS AND READING IS FOR GIRLS AND GIRLS IN TURN ARE TOLD THAT TRUCKS AND ROUGHHOUSE PLAY IS FOR BOYS THE SAME WAY THAT GIRLS ARE LATER LEAD TO BELIEVE THAT SCIENCE MATHEMATICS AND ENGINEERING ARE MASCULINE ACTIVITIES

HS ENGLISH TEACHER HERE THIS IS WHAT I WISH I COULD GET KIDS TO UNDERSTAND MY JOB IS TO FILL YOUR TOOLBOX NOT TO MAKE YOU LIKE READING EVERY TEXT I CHOOSE EVERY ASSIGNMENT I GIVE IS TO HELP YOU ACQUIRE THE TOOLS TO GO INTO YOUR BOX SO THAT WHEN YOU NEED TO OR WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING YOU CAN REACH IN THE BOX AND GET STARTED THE LIKING IS ENTIRELY UP TO YOU AND WHILE I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT MY STUDENTS LIKE AT LEAST A LITTLE OF WHAT THEY READ IT'S NOT REALLY A TOP TEN CONCERN DO YOU HAVE THE TOOLS DO YOU HAVE A LIBRARY CARD IF SO YOU ALREADY KNOW THERE ARE MORE GREAT BOOKS THAT YOU WILL LOVE THAT ARE OUT THERE WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED DON'T WASTE ANY MORE TIME GROUSING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ASSIGNED IN SCHOOL JUST GRAB A BOOK AND START THE REVOLUTION
I'M CONFUSED BY WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY A CLASSICAL BOOK ABOUT FEELINGS COULD YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE
YES TEENAGE BOYS WOULD PROBABLY READ MORE IF THEY WERE MORE OFTEN EXPOSED TO MATERIAL THAT IS WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY FOR THEM IN FORMAL EDUCATIONAL CHANNELS I THINK YOU'RE SOMEWHAT CLUMSILY GETTING AT A REAL ISSUE IN THAT AS A MALE I THINK OUR SOCIETY WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY ENRICHED BY HAVING HIGHER READERSHIP AMONG THE ADULT MALE POPULATION AND BY HAVING A HIGHER NUMBER OF BOOKS THAT ARE WRITTEN FOR A MALE AUDIENCE IT'S SOMEWHAT ODD WHITE MALES ARE THE DOMINANT CULTURAL POLITICAL FORCE IN THE ANGLO-SAXON WORLD AND HAVE BEEN FOR CENTURIES AND YET ALMOST NONE OF THE FICTION PUBLISHED IN AMERICA APPEALS TO MODERATE MIDDLE CLASS WHITE MALES AND VERY LITTLE OF WHAT IS COMMONLY TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS IS TARGETED TOWARDS CHANGING THAT SITUATION

HOWEVER THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS AND RAISED HERE

THE MOST ATTRACTIVE MATERIALS FOR TEENAGE BOYS ARE OFTEN INAPPROPRIATE FOR PRE SETTINGS BOTH IN THE MORE PARTS OF AMERICA FOR BEING OBSCENE AND IN THE PROGRESSIVE PARTS OF AMERICA FOR RUNNING AFOUL OF LEFT-WING VALUES HISTORICALLY THESE THINGS WERE ALSO CONSIDERED TOO BASE OR VULGAR TO BE INCORPORATED IN EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS SO THERE'S A BIAS THERE AS WELL
2 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY TEACHING AND CURRICULA CREATION MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IS DOMINATED BY WOMEN
SPECIFICALLY DEVELOPING CURRICULA FOR BOYS AND GIRLS IS A PROBLEMATIC PROCESS IN THAT IT REINFORCES AND SOME CASES CREATES STEREOTYPES AND PERCEPTIONS THAT HAVE NO REAL BASIS IN SCIENCE AND ARE UNDESIRABLE FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT
YOU SEND A TERRIBLE MESSAGE TO THE BOYS WHO ACTUALLY LIKE READING THE MATERIAL ABOUT THEIR MASCULINITY IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT IF YOU HAVE A CLASSMATE WHO LOVES JANE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE IMAGINE THAT IT'S LABELLED AS A GIRL BOOK YOU'VE JUST MIND AKED A CLASSMATE FOR NOTHING MORE THAN LIKING A BOOK THAT MILLIONS LOVE
THE MARKET FOR LITERATURE IS TERRIBLY UNEQUAL HISTORICALLY BOOKS WERE WRITTEN BY WELL-OFF EDUCATED MEN FOR GENERAL ACADEMIC ARISTOCRATIC CONSUMPTION IN THE LAST YEARS OR SO BOOKS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY DIRECTED TOWARDS WOMEN AS ADULT WOMEN ARE THE PRIMARY CONSUMERS OF BOOKS WITH A SMALL NICHE OF BOOKS TARGETED TO MASCULINE INTERESTS
A LOT OF WHAT ADULT LITERARY TYPES WOULD SEE AS MALE LITERATURE WOULD BORE THE CRAP OUT OF MOST FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS

PERSONALLY I THINK THE ONLY REAL SOLUTION IS TO BE SENSITIVE OF THE FACT THAT THE MODAL BOY HAS RADICALLY DIFFERENT READING INTERESTS THAN THE MODAL GIRL AND FOR WHATEVER REASON THE MODAL GIRL PICKS UP READING FOR PLEASURE AND OR AS A LIFETIME HABIT MORE OFTEN THAN THE MODAL BOY I THINK THE BEST COURSE WOULD BE TO GIVE EVERYONE SMALL SAMPLES FROM A WIDER RANGE OF TOPICS SOME OF WHICH WOULD APPEAL MORE TO BOYS INCLUDING MORE VULGAR MATERIALS

IT MIGHT ALSO BE ONE OF THOSE ISSUES WHERE THERE WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE TO HAVING SEPARATE CLASSROOMS BECAUSE I THINK A MALE TEACHER TALKING TO MALE STUDENTS ABOUT ROMEO AND JULIET OR MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING COULD DO MORE THAN A CO-ED CLASSROOM BUT THAT'S ANOTHER BAG OF WORMS
WELL ARAGON HATCHET MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THE HOBBIT WERE ALL BOOKS I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED WHEN I WAS

I READ THOSE BOOKS FOR SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL HOWEVER THOSE WERE BOOKS THAT I CHOOSE TO READ THE TEACHER DID NOT FORCE ME TO READ THEM
FIRST OF ALL I APPLAUD YOUR EFFORT TO TRY AND GET YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS INTO READING MORE

I GET TRYING TO MAKE CLASS MORE ENJOYABLE AND I ADMIT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SERBIAN EDUCATION OR LITERATURE BUT IF IT'S SIMILAR TO THE US YOUR TEACHER MAY HAVE HIS OR HER HANDS TIED AS TO WHAT THEY CAN TEACH YOU DURING SCHOOL HOURS IT'S LIKELY ON YOU TO SEEK OUT THINGS YOU LIKE AFTER HOURS

I WOULD APPROACH YOUR TEACHER AND ASK HIM HER FOR READING SUGGESTIONS MOST WILL LOVE THEIR STUDENTS SHOWING INTEREST IN THEIR SUBJECT AND WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GIVE SUGGESTIONS IF YOU BRING UP THE THEMES YOU LIKE READING MYSTERY AND VIOLENCE ARE IN A LOT OF CLASSICS TOO MAYBE BRING UP THE IDEA OF DOING AN AFTER SCHOOL READING CLUB WITH MORE CONTEMPORARY BOOKS OR ASK IF YOU CAN GET A LITTLE EXTRA CREDIT FOR WRITING REPORTS ABOUT BOOKS YOU LIKE AND HAVE READ ON YOUR OWN TIME GO INTO THIS REALIZING THAT WHAT YOU LIKE MAY NOT BE SCHOOL APPROPRIATE THOUGH AND YOUR TEACHER MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE IT THEN IT'S UP TO YOU DO JUST KEEP PURSUING IT ON YOUR OWN TIME

IN TERMS OF MAKING THE CLASSICS MORE ENJOYABLE ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT BOOKS YOU'RE READING AND WITHOUT BEING NARKY ASK WHY THE TEACHER THINKS IT'S IMPORTANT TO READ THOSE OLD BOOKS IN DAY AND AGE OR WHY THOSE THEMES ARE STILL RELEVANT X YEARS LATER THE CLASSICS ARE STILL CLASSICS FOR A REASON BUT I DEFINITELY ENJOYED THEM MORE WHEN I FIGURED OUT WHY THEY'RE STILL IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT GOOD LUCK
WHY ARE YOU FOCUSED ON GETTING THE BOYS TO CHANGE
MOST OF THE GUYS I KNOW THAT DON'T READ REFUSE BECAUSE IT'S SEEN AS GIRLY SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY LOVE IT THEY JUST PRETEND IN FRONT OF THEIR FRIENDS I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HELP THAT MUCH
ARE YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU IN LIKE 5TH GRADE BECAUSE THAT REALLY SEEMS TO BE WHAT THIS TOPIC IS GEARED TOWARDS
BASED ON THAT PDF ALONE THE THREE STAGE MODEL ASSUMES YOU'VE ALREADY READ THE BOOK SO YOU WOULD READ THE BOOK THEN GO BACK AND SUMMARISE IT AS A WHOLE STAGE I THEN GET INTO THE DETAIL STAGE II AND SO ON

HOWEVER I DON'T SEE WHY YOU COULDN'T APPLY SOMETHING SIMILAR AS YOU'RE READING IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SUMMARISE EITHER IN YOUR HEAD OR ON PAPER THE CHAPTER OR SECTION YOU'VE JUST FINISHED


I ALWAYS READ THE BOOK AND THEN SUMMARIZE IT IN MY OWN WORDS AND THEN GO BACK AND REFIND ALL OF THE RELEVANT QUOTES AND MARK THE PAGES DOWN

SYNTONICAL READING IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT BOOK FOR INSTANCE IF I WANTED TO PERFORM SOME SYNTONICAL READING ON THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH LAW OF ACT OF I WOULD REFERENCE S PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY AND LUDWIG VON MISES THEORY OF MONEY AND CREDIT TWO BOOKS THAT REFERENCE ACT IN DIFFERENT SECTIONS
FOR QUESTIONS LIKE THESE I SUGGEST YOU USE R ASKLITERARYSTUDIES THE PEOPLE OVER THERE ARE FRIENDLY AND WILL GENERALLY PROVIDE YOU WITH BETTER ANSWERS THAN R BOOKS
IT HAS BEEN AWHILE SINCE I READ THIS BOOK BUT I SEEM TO REMEMBER ADLER STATING THAT THE FIRST STAGE WAS MEANT TO HAPPEN BEFORE YOU READ THROUGH THE ENTIRE BOOK FIRST STAGE HAPPENS WITH READING THE SYNOPSIS IF THERE IS ONE AND BY READING THROUGH TABLE OF CONTENTS AND SKIMMING THROUGH THE INDEX TOC AND INDEX WILL NEARLY ALWAYS ILLUMINATE MAJOR POINTS AND KEY IDEAS THAT THE AUTHOR IS ATTEMPTING TO CONVEY
THEY'RE CLICHED AND USUALLY ANNOYINGLY WRITTEN WHAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED SOUNDS LIKE HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA
THE PROBLEM WITH LOVE TRIANGLES OR SQUARES IS THAT THEY'RE OVERUSED IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A DECENT STORY WITH A LOVE TRIANGLE BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT'S JUST A CLICHE THAT EVERYONE HAS SEEN BEFORE IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO THAT DIRECTION IN YOUR WRITING MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN ANGLE THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TO MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING
WHERE IS THE LOVE TRIANGLE THOUGH

MYRA WANTS CAL WHO WANTS X WHO WANTS MYRA THAT'S A LOVE TRIANGLE

WHO IS X

IS LIA X DOES LIA WANT MYRA WITHOUT BEING INTERESTED IN CAL

A LOVE TRIANGLE IS A SPECIFIC DEVICE THAT I'M NOT SEEING PRESENT

I'M SEEING MYRA WANTS CAL AND ISN'T ALWAYS HONEST ABOUT IT AND CAL MIGHT WANT MYRA OR LIA NO IDEA WHO LIA WANTS

WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS CERTAINLY DRAMA AND YOU MAY HAVE A CHARACTER WHO IS TORN BETWEEN TWO LOVERS BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT A LOVE TRIANGLE IS

I'M BEING PEDANTIC BECAUSE THESE DISTINCTIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO WRITTEN WORK YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE ACCURATELY

IF THERE'S A LOVE TRIANGLE AND I'M MISSING IT THEN LET ME KNOW I'D BE HAPPY TO HEAR ABOUT IT

DO I LIKE THE DRAMA HARD TO SAY I COULD SEE IT PLAYED WELL OR PLAYED POORLY IT ALSO DEPENDS ON YOUR AUDIENCE I'M NOT A BIG CONSUMER OF WORKS DRIVEN BY ROMANCE DRAMA IF THIS WAS THE DRIVING FORCE OF THE STORY I WOULD LIKELY BE DISAPPOINTED AND ANNOYED I WAS ANNOYED BY THE ROMANCE IN THE MOTE IN GOD'S EYE AND MOSTLY TRIED TO IGNORE IT BECAUSE THERE WAS OTHER MATERIAL THAT DID INTEREST ME AM I TYPICAL OF YOUR AUDIENCE I HAVE NO IDEA WHO IS DEFINE YOUR AUDIENCE IF YOU HAVEN'T

I WOULD SAY THAT FOR MY PART A GUT REACTION IS THAT I HOPE THIS DOESN'T TAKE PLACE ON MODERN DAY EARTH I HOPE YOU'VE DONE THE WORLD BUILDING NECESSARY TO MAKE THESE CHARACTERS SEEM PLAUSIBLE HOW BIG THEY CAN BE WITHOUT SEEMING ANNOYING IS GOING TO DEPEND ON HOW BIG EVERYTHING ELSE IS IT CAN BE DONE WITH A MODERN DAY EARTH SETTING BUT THAT WOULD ALL HINGE IN YOUR OVERALL BELIEVABILITY AND IF YOUR CHARACTERS FIT IN TO THE WORK AS A WHOLE I FIND THE ROMANCE ELEMENTS WITH MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO ANNOYING BUT THE WORLD THE AUTHOR PRESENTS US IS DEEP AND BELIEVABLE ENOUGH THAT THE ROMANCE IS JUST A LITTLE SCUM ON THE SURFACE OR DRESSING ON A SALAD IT IS NOT OVERWHELMING AND CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY THING DRIVING INTEREST THAT BOOK IN PARTICULAR EVEN OFFERS FRESH PERSPECTIVES AND TREATS THEM IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM THE FOCUS OF THE WORK THE NONMONOGAMY ISN'T HAM-FISTED WHAT ARE YOU PROVIDING THAT IS FRESH

AND TO END THIS BLOATED POST I WILL SAY AGAIN DEFINE YOUR AUDIENCE ANATOMY IS A CHARACTER DRIVEN DRAMA THAT WAS QUITE SUCCESSFUL IF YOU'RE GOING FOR THAT MARKET THEN GO FOR IT IT'S A BIG MARKET THAT GENERATES GREAT REVENUE DON'T GET WISHY-WASHY ABOUT WHO YOU'RE TRYING TO APPEAL TO BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY

I KNOW YOU'VE WRITTEN MORE MATERIAL AND THIS MAY NOT BE THE BEST SHOWCASE OF YOUR WORK DON'T WORRY I'M NOT JUDGING YOU AS A PERSON OR YOUR WORK I'M JUDGING ONLY WHAT INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED IN THIS POST AND AM HAPPY TO TALK THROUGH CLARIFICATION IF NECESSARY
READ INTO THE ACTUAL REASONS WHY PEOPLE HATED TWILIGHT SOUNDS LIKE THE SAME SITUATION HERE
DO YOU LIKE IT OR NOT

I WOULDN'T TOUCH THIS SHIT WITH A FORTY FOOT POLE EVEN READING THE SUMMARY IRRITATED ME YOU MIGHT THINK YOU'RE AVOIDING CLICHES OR CONVENTIONS BUT YOU'RE REALLY NOT NOTHING IN THE PLOT IS INTERESTING I DOUBT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING EVEN IF I WAS A HUGE ROMCOM FAN YOU ALSO SOUND LIKE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO GOOGLES THINGS LIKE HOW TO CREATE COMPLEX CHARACTERS AND HOW TO WRITE IN BEAUTIFUL PROSE YOUR CHARACTERS ARE NOT COMPLEX NOR ARE THEY INTERESTING IM SORRY IF I'M BEING HARSH BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO TELL YOU THIS IT WILL SAVE YOU FUTURE EMBARRASSMENT IF YOU WANT YOU CAN POST SOME OF YOUR WRITING AND I WILL TELL YOU MY THOUGHTS BUT I ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE THIS STORY ALONE FOR A BIT REALLY THINK ABOUT IT AND THEN IF IT STILL SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA COME BACK TO IT
LOVE TRIANGLES ARE BORING TO ANYONE WHO ISN'T INVOLVED IN THEM IN A BOOK THAT MEANS EVERYONE I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERYONE BUT IN MY CASE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BE INVESTED IN SOMETHING AS LOW STAKES AS WHETHER ARCHIE CHOOSES BETTY OR VERONICA

MAYBE YOU'RE THE AUTHOR WHO PROVES ME HAPPENS OFTEN I THINK THE PUBLIC IS FAIRLY DONE WITH THAT STORY
I'D LIKE TO SEE A LOVE TETRAHEDRON
IF THERE'S ONE THING TO BE ANGRY WITH THE INTERNET ABOUT IT'S THE NEVER-ENDING PROLIFERATION OF SELF-STYLED WRITERS FLOGGING THEIR POORLY CRAFTED SHIT

THAT MAY BE HARSH BUT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE HARSH WITH YOU YOUR FRIENDS AREN'T DOING IT YOU SHOULD BE FLATTERED BY THAT BECAUSE IF MY FRIEND WROTE AS POORLY AS YOU DO I WOULD RUN SCREAMING EVERY TIME SHE CAME TOWARD ME WITH PAPER IN HER HANDS YOUR FRIENDS MUST LIKE YOU AN AWFUL LOT IF THEY'RE EVEN PRETENDING TO READ SOMETHING PUT TO PAPER BY SOMEONE CAPABLE MAYBE INCAPABLE WOULD BE A BETTER WORD OF WRITING THE COMMENT ABOVE

ISAAC ASIMOV SAID SOMETHING I ALWAYS THOUGHT MADE SENSE HE SAID I'M PARAPHRASING HERE IF YOU WANT TO BE A WRITER THEN THE TOOLS OF YOUR TRADE ARE YOUR VOCABULARY AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF GRAMMAR TO BE A WRITER REQUIRES ONE TO BE EXPERT WITH THOSE TOOLS

AND YOU'RE NOT AT ALL

YES I'M MEAN BUT I'M ALSO RIGHT




I PERSONALLY JUST WISH THAT LOVE TRIANGLES WOULD BE REPLACED BY POLYAMOROUS RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE AS SOMEONE WHO IS POLY I CANNOT RELATE TO THE EMOTIONS OF LOVE TRIANGLES WHATSOEVER SO I FIND THEM BORING
LOVE TRIANGLES ARE OFTEN OVERUSED BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT THEY'RE FREQUENTLY TOO EASILY SOLVABLE EXAMPLE IF CHARACTER X WOULD COMMUNICATE IN AN OPEN AND HONEST WAY WITH CHARACTER Y THEN CHARACTER Z MAY NOT EVEN HAVE CAUGHT THEIR INTEREST MANY MANY LOVE TRIANGLES COULD HAVE BEEN SOLVED BY COMMUNICATION EITHER BETWEEN CURRENT PARTNERS OR BY VOICING THEIR FEELINGS TO ONE SIDE OF THE TRIANGLE BY KEEPING EASILY RESOLVED TRIANGLES IN PLACE IT'S EASY FOR THE READERS TO GET FRUSTRATED WITHOUT READING YOUR BOOK I CAN'T TELL IF THIS IS THE CASE WITH YOUR LOVE TRIANGLE SQUARE BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK OUT FOR
NOTHING REALLY THERE ARE SOME LOVE TRIANGLES THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE STORY OR BECOME A GREAT STORY BUT MOST OF THE TIME IT ISN'T GREAT AND JUST ANNOYING

I GUESS LOVE TRIANGLES ARE QUITE DIFFICULT TO NAIL FOR WRITERS CONSIDERING I'VE RARELY READ ONE WHICH EVEN PASSES AS ACCEPTABLE
READ MORE OFTEN READ MORE DENSE LITERARY WORKS AND THIS WILL START BECOMING LESS OF A PROBLEM AS YOU'VE SAID YOU'RE S OF THE WAY THROUGH MAY AS WELL FINISH AT THIS POINT
WHICH TRANSLATION IS IT IT MIGHT JUST BE AN OLD TRANSLATION
EXAMPLES
IT'S BOOKS LIKE THESE THAT I REALLY LIKE HAVING ON KINDLE
WHAT I DO WHEN I COME UP ACROSS WORDS I DON'T KNOW IS THAT I WRITE THEM DOWN AND THE PAGE THEY ARE FROM ONCE I FINISH THE CHAPTER I LOOK THE WORDS UP AND WRITE THE SYNONYMS OR A VERY SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE WORD WHERE IT APPEARS IN THE STORY

I FIND THIS HELPS A LOT ESPECIALLY WHEN READING BOOKS LIKE LOLITA OR CHOICE OR SOMETHING


I READ IT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS LUCKILY JOYCE TAUGHT ME WHAT GOLOSHES WERE IN THE DEAD

EDIT PLUS I KNOW FRENCH
THE PROBLEM I RAN INTO WASN'T THE VOCABULARY IT WAS THE SHEER NUMBER OF CHARACTERS WITH SIMILAR NAMES GAVE ME FITS TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH WHO WAS DOING WHAT TO WHOM WHERE WITH ONLY A LAST NAME INITIAL TO DENOTE A DIFFERENCE
SHIT DON'T SAY THAT MATE I'VE JUST STARTED BOOK 2 AND AM ENJOYING IT IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING WHAT KINDS OF WORDS
IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING FUN READING JUST STOP AND PICK UP SOMETHING ELSE
I DON'T RECALL HAVING TO LOOK UP ANY WORDS WHEN I READ IT COULD YOU GIVE SOME EXAMPLES PLEASE
I KINDA JUST INFERRED WHAT THEY MEANT AND GLAZED OVER THEM SOME OF THEM I DID HAVE TO LOOK UP THOUGH AND IT GOT TEDIOUS SO I JUST STOPPED I REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THE FRENCH IN IT TOO IF I'M THINKING OF THE RIGHT NOVEL FUCKING HATE RANDOM FRENCH WORDS INTERSPERSED THROUGHOUT BOOKS IT WAS STILL AN ENJOYABLE READ TO ME THOUGH
WELL YOU HAVE TO READ IT ALL THE WAY TO THE END TO FIND OUT WHO WON THE WAR I WON'T SPOIL THE ENDING
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IF I EVER GET AROUND TO READING IT I WILL READ IT ON THE KINDLE

THE OTHER REASON IS THAT I HAVE SMALL HANDS AND I DON'T THINK I CAN COMFORTABLY HOLD SUCH A FAMOUSLY LARGE BOOK
READ IT IN ENGLISH INSTEAD
I SAID THIS SHIT ABOUT GO SET A WATCHMAN AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN

THERE WAS PROBABLY A REALLY GOOD REASON TO NOT PUBLISH IT
IF NO ONE HAS SEEN IT HOW DID THEY PUBLISH IT

THERE'S PROBABLY A REASON FOR IT NOT HAVING BEEN PUBLISHED UNDER HIS GUISE
I'M ALWAYS WARY OF STUFF LIKE THIS WHILE IT SOUNDS COOL OF THE TIME ITS UNPUBLISHED FOR A REASON NO AUTHOR MAKES SOMETHING THEY THINK IS GOOD AND JUST NOT WANT TO SHOW ANYONE

SO THE QUESTION I BET YOU ARE ALL WONDERING

WHO OWNS THE COPYRIGHT
IS THIS PUBLIC DOMAIN OR WILL THE STRAND MAGAZINE GET COPYRIGHT FOR PUBLISHING IT

IF IT WAS WRITTEN BUT NEVER SHARED UNTIL MR GULLI FOUND IT THEN NO COPYRIGHT HAS EVER APPLIED TO IT UNTIL NOW

BACK IN THE YOU HAD TO EXPLICITLY STATE SOMETHING WAS COPYRIGHTED WHEN YOU PUBLISHED IT AS OPPOSED TO NOWADAYS WHEN SIMPLY FIXING IT IN A PERMANENT FORMAT IS CREATING A COPYRIGHT

I THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A WORK WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN HELD IN COPYRIGHT AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN PUBLIC DOMAIN BUT ANAL
PROBABLY UNPUBLISHED FOR A REASON LIKE MUSIC OF DEAD ARTISTS
DON T YOU SEE IT HE SAID

SEE WHAT

THE THING THE WOMAN

I SHOOK MY HEAD AND LOOKED AT HIM

ALL RIGHT THEN HE SAID ABRUPTLY DON T SEE IT
BUMMER LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE TO BUY A TEN DOLLAR MAGAZINE TO READ IT
TIL H G WELLS FORETOLD THE BIRTH OF WIKIPEDIA
HG WELLS IS ACTUALLY A WOMAN
UNSEEN

JUST LIKE A GHOST
SNOOPY
SHAME PAUL F TOMPKINS DEAD AUTHORS PODCAST IS NO LONGER A THING H G WOULD HAVE A THING OR 2 TO SAY ABOUT THIS
DAY IN THE GHOST HOUSE
CAN ANYONE FIND IT I'D REALLY LIKE TO READ IT BUT CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE
IT WILL BE PUBLISHED THIS WEEK SO IT'S STILL NOT OUT THERE THE ONLY WAY TO READ THE STORY IS TO WAIT FOR IT TO BE PUBLISHED AND POSTED SOMEWHERE ONLINE FOR FREE LOL
FUN FACT I WAS NAMED AFTER HG WELLS GREAT NIECE
MANY COMMENTS THAT THIS STORY MIGHT BE POORLY WRITTEN EVEN SO I LOOK FORWARD TO READING IT
SOUNDS FISHY I BET IT'S THE CREATION OF A GHOST WRITER
PROBABLY CANT BE SEEN BECAUSE IT'S A GHOST
CAN ANYONE SUGGEST AN H G WELLS STORY DES TO ME LIKE HIS SCARIER OR BETTER WORKS
THOUGHT THIS WAS R CREEPY WITH THAT TITLE
LITERAL GHOST STORY
I SUBBED FIGURE IT CAN'T HURT I MAY FIND SOMETHING USEFUL IN THE NEXT YEAR
LIKE HG WELLS ATHISTE WROTE IT
LIT FAM
CANT BE THAT GOOD IF ITS NOT IN R DOGSLEEP
ALL KIDDING ASIDE BIG FAN OF H G WELLS WORK
FOAH THIS IS VERY VERY COOL
QUICK BUILD A TIME MACHINE SO THAT WE CAN PREVENT THIS
ASW WAS HOPING FOR A STORY ABOUT H G WELLS GHOST
I'M ALWAYS VERY SKEPTICAL WHEN SOMEONE CLAIMS THEY HAVE FOUND A PUBLISHED STORY FROM A VERY WELL KNOWN AUTHOR WHOSE LIVING DEPENDED LARGELY IF NOT ENTIRELY ON THE PUBLICATION OF STORIES

ALMOST ALL OF THESE STORIES TURN OUT TO BE HOAXES
FROM THE TOLE I THOUGHT HG GHOST WROTE IT
IS TOO YOUNG THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE STORY
I TRIED AT AND IT DIDN'T HOLD HOLD HIS INTEREST FOR MORE THAN A PAGE OR TWO HE ALSO COULDN'T FOLLOW THE STORY TOO MANY CHARACTERS STARTED AGAIN AT AND HE LOVED IT
I'D DO IT BUT I DON'T HAVE KIDS AND PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE TRUSTED
I READ IT WHEN I WAS SO MAYBE LIKE IS GOOD TRY
TOO YOUNG I SUPPOSE THE STORYLINE IS VERY COMPLEX FOR A THREE-YEAR-OLD LET ALONE THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS TRY AGAIN WHEN SHE'S THAT'S WHEN HP HIT ME
REALLY ANY TIME AFTER ENTERING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND UP
I REMEMBER READING THE BOOKS WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BOOKS THIS LONG ARE PROBABLY A BIT TOO COMPLEX FOR CHILDREN THAT YOUNG THE BASE RULE WITH MY PARENTS WAS THAT I HAD TO BE ABLE TO READ IT BY MYSELF SO MAYBE WAIT A COUPLE OF YEARS UNTIL YOUR KID HAS A BETTER ATTENTION SPANISH

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LONGER FOR BEDTIME I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE JETTISON AND FINDS BOOKS THE STORIES AREN'T SUPER SHORT BUT ALSO NOT TOO LONG FOR YOUNG CHILDREN TO LOOSE INTEREST THE PAGES HAVE DETAILED PICTURES WITH LOTS OF DETAILS TO EXPLORE AND MAKE THE READING EXPERIENCE MUCH MORE INTERACTIVE AND ENJOYABLE FOR BOTH PARENT AND CHILD
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GROW UP WITH HARRY POTTER THE FIRST BOOK CAME OUT WHEN I WAS A TODDLER AND THE LAST MOVIE CAME OUT AFTER MY BIRTHDAY I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE REASON I LOVE TO READ AND WATCH FILMS IS BECAUSE OF HP STARTING AT MIGHT BE YOUNG AND YOU MIGHT READ THE FIRST BOOK TEN TIMES OVER UNTIL YOUR KIDDO IS OR BUT IT'LL BE WORTH IT FOR THE MAGIC THAT IT LENDS TO CHILDHOOD
HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S SORCERER'S STONE BEGINS WITH TENTH BIRTHDAY I THOUGHT I BEGAN READING THE SERIES OUT LOUD TO MY KIDS WHEN THEY WERE A BIT YOUNGER THAN THAT WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS MAYBE EIGHT AND MY SON WAS SIX I CHECKED WITH MY DAUGHERTY AND SHE HAS CONVINCED ME THAT THEY WERE YOUNGER YET CLOSER TO SIX AND FOUR WHATEVER THEIR AGE WE HAD A BLAST BOWLING WAS ONLY ABOUT THREE BOOKS INTO THE SERIES WHEN I STARTED SO WE CAUGHT UP PRETTY QUICKLY AS NEW VOLUMES CAME OUT MY WIFE AND I WOULD READ THEM TO OURSELVES FIRST THEN I'D READ THEM ALOUD TO THE KIDS THEN WE'D SEE THE MOVIES IN THE THEATERS AND THEN WE'D BUY THE EVERY STEP WAS A SPECIAL FAMILY OCCASION
I BELIEVE BOWLING WROTE THE FIRST BOOK FOR HER KID WHO WAS THE AGE OF HARRY IN THAT BOOK SO I WOULD GUESS THAT AGE AND LET THEM READ IF FOR THEMSELVES

SHE SAID EACH BOOK WAS WRITTEN FOR THAT AGE KID IE WHEN HARRY WAS THEN THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN AT A MATURITY LEVEL FOR A YEAR OLD I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS WHY THE LAST BOOKS GOT SO HARD AND DARK FOR EMERGING YOUNG ADULTS
HOW MATURE IS YOUR CHILD CAN SHE HANDLE SOME OF THE VIOLENCE THAT IS IN IT THE ILLUSTRATED EDITION IS AMAZING IF YOU DON'T THINK SHE IS MATURE ENOUGH FOR IT RIGHT NOW YOU MAY WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR IF YOU DO THINK SHE IS MATURE ENOUGH FOR IT GET IT FOR HER FOR CHRISTMAS AND READ A CHAPTER EVERY NIGHT
HONESTLY HAVE THEM HELP LIKE AT AGE OR SO HELP THEM READ THE FIRST SENTENCE OR PARAGRAPH OR PAGE AND THEN YOU READ THE REST OF THE CHAPTER AS THEY GET BETTER INCREASE HOW MUCH THEY READ AND ALTERNATE WITH YOU
IF THEY CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR SENTENCES THEN THEY CAN LISTEN TO YOU READ THE BOOK IT CAN BE A LITTLE SCARY AS SOMEONE WHO HAD IT READ TO ME WHEN I WAS LITTLE BUT IT'S EXCITING AND GOOD OVERALL I MIGHT SAVE THE BOOKS AFTER FOR WHEN THEY'RE AROUND THOUGH THEY'RE MORE ADULTISH
I STARTED READING IT TO MY DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS AND SHE FOUND IT QUITE FRIGHTENING SHE IS NOW AND WE HAVE READ THE WHOLE SERIES TOGETHER MANY TIMES WE ARE HALF WAY THROUGH BOOK 2 OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS AT THE MOMENT
I PERSONALLY WOULD STICK TO MORE LIGHT HEARTED STORIES FOR A YEAR OLD
OUR TEACHER READ BOOKS THROUGH TO CLASS WHEN I WAS AND I LOVED THEM TO THE POINT MY PARENTS HAD TO BUY THEM SO I COULD READ AHEAD I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FOLLOW IT VERY WELL MUCH EARLIER THOUGH

ON A SIDE NOTE THE ILLUSTRATED HARRY POTTER IS BEAUTIFUL AND I FEEL LIKE IT WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT ON IT
MY PARENTS STARTED READING THEM TO ME WHEN I WAS OR BUT I GOT TOO SCARED WHEN WE GOT TO FLUFFY ALTHOUGH I WAS PRETTY SENSITIVE SINCE I NEVER WATCHED TV OR MOVIES AND WE STOPPED

I READ THEM ON MY OWN WHEN I WAS SEVEN AND THAT WORKED MUCH BETTER FOR ME
TOO YOUNG TRY I WANT MY HAT BACK DREAM ANIMALS GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT CONSTRUCTION SITE BOOM SNOT TWITTY
MY BROTHER AND SISTER-IN-LAW STARTED READING IT TO MY YEAR-OLD NIECE BUT HAD TO STOP BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING TOO SCARY FOR HERALDRY
I READ IT WHEN I WAS OR SO SO THAT'S PROBABLY ALL RIGHT
I WAS IN FIRST GRADE WHEN I STARTED THE SERIES SO LIKE OR
ASW THEY HAVE PICTURE BOOK VERSIONS YOU COULD TRY IT AND SEE IF THEY LIKE IT EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET THE STORY JUST THE ACT OF HAVING A PARENT READ TO YOU ENTHUSIASTICALLY AT THAT AGE CAN BE GOOD FOR BONDING AND ASSOCIATING BOOKS WITH GOOD THINGS
I HAD BOOK READ TO ME WHEN I WAS THERE WERE BITS I FOUND CONFUSING AND I THINK I WAS TOO YOUNG I THOUGHT FRED AND GEORGE TOOK NORBERT A BIGGER ISSUE FOR ME IS IF YOU CONTINUE THE FURTHER BOOKS A LOT OF THE ANGER BETWEEN HERMIONE AND RON AROUND THE YULE BALL FLEW OVER MY HEAD EVEN YEARS LATER AS IT RELIED ON RECOGNISING TEENAGE HORMONES AND PUBERTY
READ THE BRITISH VERSION IN KINDERGARTEN THOUGHT EVERYONE HAD TELEPATHIC ABILITIES BECAUSE THEY SPOKE WITH THESE INSTEAD OF THESE
I WAS WHEN MY PARENTS STARTED READING HP TO ME HAVE AN OLDER SISTER WHO RECEIVES THE BOOKS AS A GIFT FROM RELATIVES

IT WENT OKAY THOUGH MY SISTER SELFISHLY READ AHEAD AND DEMANDED WE SKIP CHAPTERS
TO BE HONEST I'M YEARS OLD AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO START READING IT I HAVE NOTHING TO REGRET IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO START READING HP EVEN MY FRIEND'S MOM IS READING IT RIGHT NOW
ALL CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE THE AUDIO BOOK READ BY STEPHEN FRY PUMPED INTO THE WOMB BY SPEAKERS AT LEAST TIMES IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE BIRTH AND THEN A CHAPTER A NIGHT FROM THEN ON

YES I AM BEING SERIOUS

I WOULD PERSONALLY SAY ABOUT OR BUT ALL KIDS ARE DIFFERENT AND I HAVENT SEEN THESE BOOKS SO I CANT MAKE A PROPER JUDGEMENT
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT POOR PEOPLE AND THEREFORE PEOPLE OF COLOUR READ LESS THAT'S THE WHOLE ARTICLE I ALSO FIND VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT OF AMERICANS HAVE TOUCHED A BOOK THIS YEAR
PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIVE IN AMERICA
I DIDN'T READ THE ARTICLE AND NOW I FEEL LIKE I COULD POSSIBLY BE A VICTIM OF A PRANK
ILLITERATE PEOPLE
THE STUDY APPEARS TO SHOW THAT US AMERICANS ARE BY AND LARGE LITERATE BUT LOTS OF OTHER STUFF IT LEAVES UNANSWERED
I'M SURPRISED THAT SUBURBAN IS HIGHER THAN URBAN IS GUESS IT WOULD BE THE OPPOSITE
PEOPLE WITH WIFI
SOMETIMES PEOPLE SET ASIDE BOOKS A SORT OF SECOND-HAND LIFE IN FAVOR OF LIFE ITSELF
I'VE KINDA DECIDED THAT I WILL NEVER AGAIN TOUCH JULIAN BARNES BOOKS AFTER I FINISHED READING SENSE OF AN ENDING GOD I HATED THAT BOOK I REALLY DID
NOT YET BUT I READ THE FIRST CHAPTER AND IT WAS BRILLIANT
HOW DOES THE NOISE OF TIME COMPARE WITH SENSE OF AN ENDING I ALSO LOVED SENSE OF AN ENDING AND I LOVE JULIAN WRITING IN GENERAL
IF YOU LIKED THE SENSE IF ENDING CHECK OUT PAUL THE NEW YORK TRILOGY SPECIFICALLY THE THIRD ONE THE LOCKED ROOM I READ SENSE EARLIER THIS YEAR AND FINISHED NYU LAST WEEK AND IT WAS ALTOGETHER EERIE HOW MUCH THEY REMIND ME OF EACH OTHER
ARE YOU REFERRING TO NOTE MAKING WHILST READING A NOVEL PROSE FICTION WORK ETC IF SO THEN IT'S TOTALLY DOWN TO PERSONAL PREFERENCE MANY PEOPLE PREFER NOT TO AS THIS CAN SOMETIMES DETRACT FROM THE OVERALL IMMERSION WHICH FOR MANY READERS REMAINS THE END GOAL OF READING HOWEVER FOR SOME NOTE TAKING COULD POSSIBLY ACT AS A REMINDER LIKE YOU MENTIONED OR PERHAPS AS A STIMULATING FACTOR TO ENCOURAGE EXPLORATION OF CHARACTERS PLOTS ETC
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING NOTES IN A BOOK I GENERALLY DON'T DO THAT IF I COME ACROSS SOMETHING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IN A BOOK OR TALK MORE ABOUT I'LL WRITE IT OUT IN A NOTEPAD DOCUMENT GO TO MY TVTROPES ACCOUNT AND ADD IT TO THE WORK PAGE IN QUESTION
I HAVE READ SO MANY BOOKS THAT BY NOW I CAN'T EVEN NAME HALF OF THEM WHICH MAKES ME KIND OF SAD BECAUSE THEY ESSENTIALLY MADE ME WHO I AM SO I'VE JUST STARTED TAKING NOTES I HAVE A THIN SMALLISH NOTEBOOK THAT I CARRY AROUND IT HAS A FEW STICKY NOTES IN IT THAT I MARK PAGES WITH WHENEVER I'M READING AND ENCOUNTER SOMETHING INSPIRING OR NOTICE AN EXAMPLE OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT ETC I PUT A STICKY NOTE AT THAT SPOT AND WRITE DOWN THE PARAGRAPH AND LINE THEN JOT A QUICK NOTE OR COMMENT WHEN I'M FINISHED READING THE BOOK I WRITE DOWN THE TITLE IN THE NOTEBOOK WITH THE FINISHING DATE AND MAYBE EVEN STARTING DATE WRITE A QUICK SUMMARY AND THEN REVIEW IT LAST I'LL GO BACK TO THE SICKIES NOTES AND WRITE DOWN THE PASSAGES OR QUOTES THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME AND HOW THEY MADE ME FEEL
MY PARTNER IS FROM SOUTH AMERICA AND HAS BEEN IN THE US FOR ABOUT YEARS HE'S VERY INTERESTED TO READ AN ACCESSIBLE BOOK ON MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY LIKE FROM VIETNAM ERA TO THE PRESENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUCH A BOOK I'VE GIVEN HIM BOOK ON NIXON NIXONLAND BUT HE FOUND THAT TOO DENSE ANYONE KNOW OF ANYTHING MORE ACCESSIBLE BUT WRITTEN AT A HIGH LEVEL THANKS

I DONATE THEM TO THE LOCAL LIBRARY OR HOST A BOOK SWAP WITH MY FRIENDS
IN MY AREA PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAS A USED BOOK SALE FOR FUND RAISING LOOK AROUND TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN YOUR AREA WHILE A LIBRARY MIGHT NOT TAKE CERTAIN BOOKS THRIFT SHOPS WILLIAM I SAVE MOST OF MY BOOKS JUST IN CASE THOUGH NOW ABOUT OF THEM ARE DIGITAL AND ON MY IPAD
I DELETE THEM FROM MY KINDLE AND KEEP A COPY IN MY DIGITAL BOOKS LIBRARY

I GOT RID OF OF MY PHYSICAL BOOKS BY DONATING THEM BY GIVING THEM TO PEOPLE I KNEW WHO WANTED TO READ THEM THERE ARE PLACES OTHER THAN LIBRARIES THAT WILL TAKE BOOKS THRIFT STORES USED BOOK STORES WHO MIGHT BE THRILLED ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT BEING PAID MUCH IF NO ONE REALLY WANTS THEM AT ALL THEN IT'S TIME TO RECYCLE AND SEND THEM BACK TO THE EARTH
I USUALLY BRING THEM TO GOODWILL SALVATION ARMY OR RESTORE THEY'RE NOT TERRIBLY PICKY ABOUT DONATIONS
BOOKS I ENJOYED READING ARE BOOKS I'M GOING TO READ AGAIN

YOUR PROBLEM IS A LACK OF BOOKSHELF NOT TOO MANY BOOKS
TRY I JUST SIGNED UP FOR THE WEBSITE YOU CAN POST BOOKS AND REQUEST BOOKS

I ONLY THE KEEP THE GOOD ONES OUT OF ABOUT A FEW HUNDRED I'VE READ IN MY LIFETIME THIS IS ABOUT THE OTHERS I LEND TO FRIENDS HOPING THEY'LL NEVER RETURN
CLIMATE CONTROLLED STORAGE THERE IS NO WAY I'M GETTING RID OF MY BOOKS PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO GET A BIGGER UNIT SOON
MY PLAN IS TO HAVE A ROOM WITH ONLY BOOKS INSIDE IN THE FUTURE YES ONLY BOOKS WHEN PEOPLE WILL ASK I'LL SAY THIS IS MY BOOKS ROOM IT WILL BE BEAUTIFUL I EVEN HAVE A PROJECT OF HOW I WANT IT TO BE
SO I HAVE TO KEEP MOST OF THEM BUT TIME TO TIME I LIKE TO DONATE TO MY LIBRARY IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO DO
SELL THEM ONLINE OR FLEA MKT WHATEVER SEND ME A LIST I MIGHT WANNA BUY A FEW
I'VE BEGUN BRINGING THEM TO LITTLE FREE LIBRARIES FEELS RIGHT
AFRAID I CANNOT HELP AS I RETURN THEM TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY FROM WHICH I BORROWED THEM
RETURN THEM TO THE LIBRARY
I USUALLY TAKE THEM TO A USED BOOK STORE OR DONATE THEM TO A THRIFT SHOP OR LIBRARY SALE THE LOCAL LIBRARY HERE OCCASIONALLY HOLDS BOOK SALES THAT RELY ON DONATIONS

I HAVE TO NITPICK ON A LITTLE POINT THOUGH LIBRARIES DON'T THROW AWAY BOOKS BECAUSE THEY DEEM THEM UNINTERESTING BUT BECAUSE LIBRARIES HAVE A COLLECTION POLICY THAT OUTLINES WHAT KINDS OF MATERIALS CAN BE PUT INTO THE COLLECTION WITH THE NEEDS WANTS OF THE PARTICULAR COMMUNITY THAT THE LIBRARY IS SERVING IN MIND YOU COULD DONATE A BOOK TO THE LIBRARY AND IT COULD BE ONE OF THE FAVOURITE BOOKS BUT IF IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE COLLECTION IT WON'T GO INTO THE COLLECTION LIBRARIES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SHELF SPACE TO JUST KEEP EVERYTHING DONATED TO THEM AND EVERY SPACE THAT IS TAKEN UP BY A BOOK THAT ISN'T NEEDED OR WANTED BY THE COMMUNITY IS A SPACE THAT A MORE SUITABLE BOOK COULD BE OCCUPYING
MAIL THEM TO FRIENDS
I USUALLY KEEP THEM UNTIL I LEND GIVE THEM TO FRIENDS FAMILY TO READ

I PROBABLY SHOULD GO THROUGH AND DONATE THE ONES I'M NOT GOING TO READ BUT THERE IS AN AESTHETIC APPEAL TO A BOOKSHELF IN A WAY I THINK
SOME I KEEP PARTICULARLY THE ONES I THINK WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REPLACE THE ONES I KNOW I'LL WANT TO READ AGAIN OR THE ONES I REGULARLY USE AS REFERENCE THE REST I BOX UP AND TAKE OVER GOODWILL EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I USED TO SAVE LITERALLY ALL MY BOOKS BUT I DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO DO THAT ANYMORE REALISTICALLY I COULD DOWNSIZE EVEN MORE AND I WOULD LIKE TO BUT I FEEL AN UNREASONABLE ATTACHMENT TO A LOT OF MY BOOKS MPH MAYBE SOME DAY
MY WIFE HAS A FLEA MARKET BOOTH WITH A SHELF IN IT FOR MY BOOKS SOMEONE USUALLY SNAPS THEM UP AND SINCE I BUY A LOT OF BOOKS AT THRIFT STORES AND WHAT NOT I EVEN END UP MAKING A BUCK OR TWO


IS A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO GIVE TRADE FOR BOOKS
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT GETTING RID OF SOME OF MY UNTOUCHED BOOKS TOO I'M LEANING TOWARDS SELLING THEM ON EBAY OR AMAZON OR GIVING THEM TO PEOPLE WHO I KNOW WOULD ENJOY READING IT THERE'S ALSO THIS USED BOOKSTORE THAT I GIVE A LOT OF MY BUSINESS TO SO I MIGHT SELL THEM THERE YOU COULD DONATE THEM TO CHARITY AS WELL
BOOKS ARE NOT ONLY FOR READING THEY'RE ALSO GREAT DECORATION BUY A GOOD BOOKSHELF AND USE THE BOOKS TO DECORATE YOU LIVING ROOM
I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM I WANT TO KEEP BUYING AND COLLECTING BOOKS BUT DON'T HAVE THE SPACE FOR ANY BUT THE NICEST EDITIONS REALLY I USUALLY GIVE THE BOOKS I'VE READ TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO MIGHT ENJOY THEM A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER OR OTHERWISE DONATE TO A CHARITY SHOP
I PUT THEM ON SHELVES AND SOMETIMES LOAN THEM OUT TO FRIENDS
BOOK STORES USED OFTEN GIVE STORE CREDIT AND OR TAKE DONATIONS
IF IT IS A PHYSICAL BOOK IT GOES INTO ONE OF THE PILES SURROUNDING MY BOOKSHELVES IF IT IS AN BOOK I REMOVE IT FROM MY DREADER
LOAN THEM OUT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO KEEP THEM MOVING
I KEEP A LOT OF REFERENCE BOOKS ART INSTRUCTION WILDLIFE GUIDES ETC BUT I TEND NOT TO HOLD ONTO MANY NOVELS I SELL THEM TO HALF PRICE BOOKS DON'T GET MUCH FOR THEM BUT I'LL TAKE THE FEW BUCKS AND PROBABLY SPEND IT ON ANOTHER BOOK AH HA AND THE BOOKS WILL HOPEFULLY GO TO SOMEONE WHO WILL ENJOY THEM
I SELL THEM ONLINE OR DONATE THEM ONE OF MY FRIENDS DOES SOMETHING FUN WHENEVER HE WANTS TO PURGE BOOKS FROM HIS COLLECTION HE POSTS A PICTURE OF THEM ALL LAID OUT ON FACEBOOK AND HAS FRIENDS COMMENT WITH WHAT THEY WANT FIRST COME FIRST SERVE HE'LL SCHEDULE A TIME ON A WEEKEND TO HANG OUT DOWNTOWN WITH THE BOOKS AND WE CAN COME BY AND PICK THEM UP AND CATCH UP A BIT SAVES HIM POSTAGE YOU COULD ALSO HOST A PARTY AND INCLUDE A BOOK SWAP
AS A LIBRARIAN I GET TONS OF BOOKS FOR FREE THAT I'LL NEVER READ AGAIN NO MATTER HOW MUCH SHELF SPACE I HAVE IT'S NEVER ENOUGH IT'S IMPORTANT TO WEED YOUR COLLECTION GETTING RID OF BOOKS THAT YOU'LL NEVER READ MAKES FOR A BETTER LOOKING SHELF
THAT BEING SAID FRIENDS GET FIRST DIBS ON MY DISCARDS THAT CLEARS AWAY A FEW NEXT I TAKE THEM TO MY PLACE OF EMPLOY AND PUT THEM IN THE LOUNGE WHATEVER IS LEFT GETS DONATED TO THE LOCAL WOMEN'S SHELTER AND THE RETIREMENT HOME BY MY HOUSE
TRY TAKING RECENT BOOKS TO A LOCAL USED BOOKSTORE THEY'LL GIVE YOU STORE CREDIT SO YOU CAN GET SOMETHING NEW THIS IS HOW I KEEP MY COLLECTION PRUNED MY SHOP ONLY GIVES ME FOR EACH BOOK BUT IF THEY TAKE BOOKS THAT GIVES ME ENOUGH CREDIT TO BUY 2 NEW TO ME ONES IT SEEMS LIKE A RIPOFF BUT OUT 2 IN IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO WRANGLE IN SOME CLUTTER PLUS THE ALTERNATIVE IS PROBABLY TO GIVE THEM AWAY DONATE SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'D GET MONEY FOR THEM ANYWAYS
LIBRARY BOOKS GO BACK TO THE LIBRARY AS FOR THE REST

IF I KNOW SOMEONE WHO I THINK WOULD LOVE IT I'LL GIFT IT OVER TO A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER

IF I DON'T KNOW SOMEONE THEN I'LL KEEP IT IF I WANT OTHERWISE IT'S OVER TO A LITTLE FREE LIBRARY
I USUALLY TRY TO GET BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY FIRST IF I LIKE IT THE BOOK THEN GOES ON MY SHELVES
CREATE A LIBRARY WEED OUT BOOKS THAT ARE EITHER IN POOR CONDITION OR SOMETHING YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN READING ANYMORE THEN DONATE THEM TO A THRIFT STORE OR LIBRARY

SORT YOUR BOOKS BY HARDCOVER SOFT-COVER LIMIT YOURSELF TO BUYING FROM AUTHORS GENRES YOU'VE VERY INTERESTED IN AND BE THE ENVY OF YOUR FRIENDS
RETURN THEM TO THE LIBRARY

COUNT OLAF
IT ISN'T WHILE I CAN'T FIND ANY CONCRETE NUMBERS FOR THE WORLD FOR THE US AT LEAST ACCORDING TO PEW RESEARCH READING HAS BEEN STEADY SINCE THERE IS SOME INTERESTING STUFF IN THE ARTICLE AND THEY HAVE SOME FUN GRAPHS TO PLAY AROUND WITH THERE ARE SOME OTHER NUMBERS OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET INCLUDING SOME SURVEYS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES

SO NO I WOULD SAY READING ISN'T A DYING HOBBY
IN THE BIBLE NAHUM I'VE NOTICED BABY BOOMERS HAVE A TENDENCY TO PURPORT THIS LIKE MILLENNIAL HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO READ IN OUR SUPERFICIAL SOCIAL MEDIA OBSESSED WORLD BUT RECENT RESEARCH ACTUALLY SUGGESTS THAT YOUNGER GENERATIONS READ MORE THAN OLDER GENERATIONS
I THINK IT IS A STORY THAT IT INCREDIBLY EASY TO BELIEVE REGARDLESS OF IF IT IS TRUE IF SOMEONE TOLD ME CHILDREN UNDER NO LONGER KNEW WHAT BOOKS WERE I MIGHT BELIEVE IT BECAUSE OF HOW TECHNOLOGY HAS INTEGRATED ITSELF INTO ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES

HOWEVER I DON'T THINK THAT IT BEING BELIEVABLE MAKES IT TRUE FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN READING HAS BEEN PERSISTING AND THRIVING IN SOME CASES IT JUST ISN'T A FLASHY HOBBY THAT MAKES IT INTO THE NEWS WHEN IS THE LAST TIME SOMEONE READ THE CATCHER AND THE RYE AND KILLED A CELEBRITY ALL THE MEDIA DRIVEN CRIME MOTIVATION IS ASSIGNED TO VIDEO GAMES AND STUFF WE CAN GET MAD ABOUT

WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT BUT READERS KEEP READING NON READERS KEEP DISCOVERING READING AND BECOMING READERS LIKE MYSELF NEVER READ FOR PLEASURE BEFORE MONTHS AGO SINCE THEN I'VE READ FULL LENGTH NOVELS AND I'M A FULL TIME STUDENT I THINK UNTIL OUR BRAINS EVOLVE TO STOP MAKING READING SO AMAZING PEOPLE ARE GONNA KEEP READING
NAH ALIVE AND WELL

I DON'T NEED DATA TO KNOW THAT
BOOKS ARE NOT DYING THIS QUESTION COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH REGARD TO BOOKS THE DATA SIMPLY DOES NOT SHOW IT
I SAID IT THE OTHER DAY AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN THEY'RE DIVERSIFYING NOT DYING
NOPE

PEOPLE ARE BUYING MORE BOOKS AND LIBRARY CIRCULATIONS HAVE INCREASED

THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BACK IN MYYYY DAY THINGS WERE BETTER STORIES WITH NO BASIS IN REALITY
HAPPY THANKSGIVING DAY
I LEFT THANKSGIVING WITH SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS SCREENS COMPETE FOR MY TIME BUT BOOKS WILL ALWAYS HAVE MY HEART
I DON'T THINK IT IS DYING BUT I DO THINK IT IS BECOMING MORE NICHE AS IN I REMEMBER READING SOMEWHERE THAT THE TOTAL MARKET FOR FICTION IS ROUGHLY THE SAME AS IT WAS IN THE PAST BOTH IN UNITS SOLD AND INFLATION ADJUSTED DOLLARS BUT THAT AS THE POPULATION INCREASES THIS MEANS THAT IN RELATIVE TERMS A SMALLER PORTION OF THE POPULATION READS ON A REGULAR BASIS OR POSSIBLY READS LESS

DAMNED IF I CAN REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE I READ THIS BIT OF WISDOM SORRY BUT IT KIND OF SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BASED UPON MY VERY UNSCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS I ALSO DON'T REMEMBER IF THEY WERE THROWING STUFF LIKE AUDIOBOOKS INTO THE MIX WHICH ARE NOW VERY POPULAR BUT ONCE UPON A TIME WERE NOT AT ALL SIGNIFICANT


IT FEELS THAT WAY TO ME I HAVE TWO NEPHEWS AND A NIECE AND NONE OF THEM READ AT ALL BUT THAT'S ABOUT AS UNSCIENTIFIC AS YOU CAN GET
FOR ME IT READ LIKE A BOOK ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA AND MODERN COMPUTING BY A HUMAN BEING WHO IS ONLY AWARE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND MODERN COMPUTING THROUGH HIS NEWS BUBBLE EGGERS IS BETTER THAN WHAT THE CIRCLE OFFERED
IT WAS PRETTY ON THE NOSE BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS ALRIGHT IT WAS MY FIRST EGGERS SO I CAN'T REALLY COMPARE IT TO THE REST DEFINITELY DIDN'T GET ME RARING TO RUN OUT AND BUY MORE OF HIS WORK I THOUGHT SOME OF THE POINTS HE MADE ABOUT OUR CHANGING VIEW OF PRIVACY WERE VALID BUT NOTHING GROUNDBREAKING
I THOUGHT IT STARTED OUT WITH AN INTERESTING PREMISE AND ENDING UP JUST BEING ANNOYING THE PLOT PROGRESSION BECAME PRETTY LUDICROUS THE CIRCLE TAKES HALF A PAGE TO OVERTHROW THE ENTIRE AMERICAN VOTING SYSTEM AND NO ONE EVEN HESITATES OR SEES ANY PROBLEM IN THIS YEAH RIGHT THE CHARACTERS EXISTED IN SOME SORT OF BUBBLE WORLD WHERE NO ONE EVER CONSIDERS THE ETHICS OR CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY USE AND I GET THAT HE DID THAT TO MAKE HIS POINT BUT IT JUST DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT IN THE REAL WORLD SO IT MADE THE WHOLE THING FEEL INCREDIBLY FAKE IT WAS SO OVER THE TOP THAT I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT IF IT'S A PARODY OR MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY INSTEAD

READ A HEARTBREAKING WORK OF STAGGERING GENIUS INSTEAD IT IS AS ITS TITLE SUGGESTS A MUCH BETTER READ
I ENJOYED PARTS OF THE STORY AND THE QUESTIONS IT RAISED ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA BUT FOUND THE MAIN CHARACTER TO BE INCREDIBLY NAIVE WHICH BOTHERED ME A LOT HE WAS HEAVY HANDED WITH FORESHADOWING AND EVERYTHING FELT OBVIOUS AND PREDICTABLE YET THE MAIN CHARACTER SOMEHOW MANAGED NOT TO NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG OR EVEN UNUSUAL I SPENT MOST OF THE BOOK WANTING TO SHAKE HER AND TELL HER SHE WAS AN IDIOT SHE WAS INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING
THE STORY ITSELF HAD SOME PROMISE BUT OVERALL IT FELL PRETTY FLAT DEFINITELY WAS EASY TO READ BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT'S A QUALIFIER FOR BEING A GOOD BOOK
I REALLY LIKED THE TAKE ON THE FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE MESSAGES ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF ITS USE BUT THE WRITING ITSELF TOOK QUITE A BIT OF EFFORT TO GET ENGAGED IN BECAUSE IT SEEMED SO BLAND TO ME THERE WOULD BE LONG DIALOGUE PASSAGES THAT SEEMED PRETTY UNNECESSARY AND A LOT OF IT WAS PREDICTABLE BUT THE IDEA AND MESSAGE BEHIND THE WHOLE STORY WAS PRETTY GREAT
HAVING READ AUTHOR GEORGE ORWELL A BRAVE NEW WORLD AUTHOR ALDOUS HUXLEY I FOUND THE CIRCLE IN A CHARITY SHOP IN AMERICAN SLANG THRIFT SHOP THE BOOK BORED ME I GOT TO PAGE WOW AND STOPPED READING IT I KNOW IT'S A PARODY AGAINST SOCIAL MEDIA BUT IT'S 2 BORING
I HAVE ADAD AND READING IS ONE OF THE FEW ACTIVITIES I CAN DO FOR HOURS AT A TIME THANKS TO SELECTIVE FOCUS

WHEN I WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL I HAD A TEACHER WHO WOULD SEND ME OFF INTO THE CORNER TO READ BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I WOULDN'T DISRUPT THE CLASSICAL
I FEEL YOU STRUGGLE MANUAL I HAVE ADAD AS WELL READING ACTUALLY CALMS ME DOWN AND ALLOWS ME TO NOT ZONE OUT AS MUCH BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY HELPS BESIDES MEDICINE IS READING FOR MINUTES AND EVERY TIME YOU THINK A THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO ZONE OUT ON WRITE IT DOWN AND GET BACK TO READING AFTER THE MINUTES LOOK UP OR DO WHAT IS ON THAT LIST FOR MINUTES THEN GO BACK TO READING IT WORKS WITH THE ADAD INSTEAD OF AGAINST IT HOPE THIS HELPS
REGULAR INTENSE EXERCISE LIKE AN HOUR AT THE GYM OR A MINUTE RUN AT LEAST WEEK WORKS WONDERS FOR ME AS A NICE BONUS IT IMPROVES YOUR MOOD AND MAKES YOU STRONGER LOOK BETTER AND LIVE LONGER WITH FEWER CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY DO IT JUST FOR THE INCREASED CONCENTRATION
AUDIOBOOKS WHEN DOING BORING STUFF IS AMAZING YOU'RE ENTERTAINED AND GET STUFF DONE AT THE SAME TIME
I LIKE TO READ LISTENING TO WHITE NOISE NOT TRULY WHITE NOISE OH WELL LIKE MUSIC IN OTHER LANGUAGES OR INSTRUMENTAL ORCHESTRAS IT HELPS MY FOCUS SPECIALLY IF I'M GETTING DISTRACTED WITH STUFF AROUND ME
I NEVER DID FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BUT TO ACCEPT IT AND READ ONLY THE REALLY REALLY GOOD BOOKS
ONE SYMPTOM OF ADD ADAD IS HYPER FOCUSING SO WHILE WE ARE OFTEN BOMBARDED WITH CONFLICTING THOUGHTS SOMETIMES A SUBJECT OR ACTIVITY CAN BLOCK THOSE OUT AND INSTEAD WE HYPER FOCUS ON THAT THING

AS FOR THE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE CONCENTRATION MY ADVICE IS TO BECOME MORE IN TUNED WITH YOUR NATURAL CYCLES THERE ARE GOING TO BE TIMES WHEN YOUR ENERGY LEVEL IS HIGHER OR LOWER A TIME WHEN YOU ARE FEELING EXTREMELY FIDGETY IS NOT A GOOD TIME TO READ

I TOOK DRUGS FOR A FEW YEARS BUT FELT LIKE THE RITALIN WAS CHANGING MY BRAIN AND ENERGY LEVELS SO NOW I TRY TO PLAN MY DAY OUT BASED ON HOW MY BODY IS FUNCTIONING IT HELPS
I HATE READING AND I DON'T HAVE ADAD WHAT I'VE DONE TO SORT OF COMBAT THIS IS I READ LIKE A COUPLE PAGES A DAY OR A CHAPTER IF IT GETS TO A PIVOTAL PART I JUST DON'T READ FOR HOURS ON END CAUSE MY MIND WANDERS AND I STOP THINKING ABOUT THE BOOK
I HAVE ADAD TOO I WAS PUZZLED ABOUT THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO READ MANY HOURS AT A TIME UNTIL I STARTED TERRY DISCWORLD BOOKS I AM ABLE TO FOCUS ON THOSE FOR MANY HOURS AT A TIME FROM THE DISCWORLD SERIES TO OTHER FANTASY WORKS I FOUND THAT I AM ABLE TO READ FANTASY BOOKS FOR HOURS WITHOUT LOSING FOCUS SO IT SEEMS FANTASY KEEPS MY ATTENTION BETTER THAN OTHER GENRES

MAYBE YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING WHICH INTERESTS YOU ENOUGH TO KEEP YOUR ATTENTION
IS THAT A SYMPTOM OF ADAD AS MUCH AS I LOVE READING I FIND MYSELF HAVING TO BOUNCE BACK OVER PAGES BECAUSE I ZONE OUT A LOT I CAN'T KEEP FOCUS I JUST SORT OF BATTLE THROUGH I END UP HAVING TO REREAD CHAPTERS
I CAN'T EVER REMEMBER WHAT I'VE READ I'LL READ A CHAPTER PUT THE BOOK DOWN THEN THE NEXT DAY PICK IT UP AND START READING THE NEXT CHAPTER AND I WILL HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER

OF COURSE THIS HAPPENS TO ME WITH MOVIES AS WELL I COULDN'T TELL YOU IN DETAIL ABOUT THE LAST MOVIE I WATCHED AND IF I IT IT'S LIKE A NEW MOVIE TO ME
MY ADAD EXPERIENCE WITH BOOKS IS VERY SIMILAR TO YOURS
NOT SURE THIS IS HELPFUL FOR YOU BUT THE ONLY WAY I WAS ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ENOUGH TO FINISH MY HIGH SCHOOL HISTORY READING WAS TO BALANCE ON THE BACK OF MY CHAIR IT GAVE THE FIDGETY PART OF MY BRAIN SOMETHING TO DO
TRY MOVING WHILE READING EITHER ON A TREADMILL OR WITHIN A DEFINED SPACE WHERE YOU CAN WALK UNINTERRUPTED
DON'T PLAN ON READING FOR HOURS AT A TIME IF YOU CAN MANAGE MINUTES THEN STICK TO IT TAKE A BREAK AND GO BACK TO READING FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME CREATE REALISTIC AND MANAGEABLE GOALS
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS THOUGH SOMETIMES I PICK UP A BOOK AND HAVE TO PUT IT DOWN AFTER THE FIRST PAGE WHILE OTHER TIMES I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SIT FOR 2 HOURS BEFORE I START ZONING OUT

WHEN YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SOMETHING YOUR BRAIN RELEASES THE DOPAMINE AND NOREPINEPHRINE NEEDED TO KEEP YOUR NEURONS FIRING YOU REALLY NEED TO BE A POSITIVE PERCY AND TRY TO BRING OUT WHAT YOU ENJOY ABOUT A SUBJECT IT MIGHT SEEM CORNY BUT THEN LIFE IS SHORT AND AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO PUT ASIDE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS AND ATTITUDES ANYWAY

AMAZING THAT I MADE IT TO THE END OF THE POST SINCE I HAVEN'T REMEMBERED TO TAKE MY MEDICINE YET TODAY THINK THE BACKGROUND NOISE HELPS ME FOCUS AND READ THE MOST TELEVISION IS ON IN THE OTHER ROOM AND MY DAUGHTER IS WATCHING YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON HER PHONE
I DIDN'T START TAKING ADD MEDICINE UNTIL AFTER FINISHING MEDICAL SCHOOL SURPRISINGLY I APPARENTLY DEVELOPED A LOT OF COPING STRATEGIES TO HELP WITH READING AND STUDYING WOULD ALWAYS GO TO A RESTAURANT OR PLACES WHERE THERE WAS A BIT OF CONSTANT ACTIVITY AND CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN OTHER PEOPLE ALSO BRINGING THINGS TO THE GYM TO READ WHILE ON TREADMILL ELLIPTICAL ETC WHEN ALONE LISTENING TO DANCE TRACKS WITH MONOTONOUS BEATS LIKE TRANCE WAS HELPFUL
HOPE IT IS ENCOURAGING TO ANYONE FEELING INSECURE ABOUT THEIR ADD GIFT TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN STILL ACCOMPLISH LOFTY GOALS LIKE BECOMING A DOCTOR YOU JUST NEED TO LEARN WHAT IT TAKES TO HARNESS YOUR BRILLIANT POTENTIAL
SORRY SO MANY MEDICINE YET GOING TO GET IT RIGHT NOW
U WHYCANTIHAVESPACES

THIS IS A GREAT TOPIC YOU HAVE RAISED ADD OR NOT WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING IS QUITE NORMAL IN SO FAR AS ANYTHING IS NORMAL IN THAT IT IS FRANKLY DIFFICULT TO CONCENTRATE ON ANY ONE THING EXCLUSIVELY IN OUR CULTURE

A FEW QUICK POINTS

READING FOR ONLY MINUTES AT A TIME IS FINE DO IT FREQUENTLY IF YOU WANT TO GET MORE READING DONE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY DOING IT AT THE SAME TIME EACH DAY CAN BE HELPFUL TOO DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO READ FOR HOURS ON END JUST BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DO IT MAKE YOUR MIND AND YOUR CAPACITIES WORK FOR YOU IF YOU WANT TO READ FOR LONGER AT A TIME JUST KEEP DOING WHAT YOU CAN DO AND PUSH YOUR SESSIONS BY MINUTES AT A TIME EVENTUALLY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO READ FOR LONGER AT A CLIP IT IS BY NO MEANS AN INSURMOUNTABLE GOAL BUT ALSO NOT NECESSARILY ONE YOU HAVE TO HAVE IN ORDER TO ENJOY THE LIFE OF AN AVID READER PUSH YOURSELF IF YOU LIKE BUT DON'T MAKE YOURSELF UNHAPPY OVER IT

2 I ALSO FIND FIRST THING IN THE MORNING TO BE THE BEST TIME TO READ DO YOUR MINUTES THEN WHENEVER POSSIBLE

IF COFFEE HELPS EMBRACE IT IT DEFINITELY HELPS ME

MEDITATION IS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO INCREASE YOUR ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE AND TO HAVE A STILL MIND

HANGOVERS EH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT AVOID THEM DRINKING A BUNCH ISN'T ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP ANYTHING TRUST ME

SOCIAL MEDIA IS TERRIBLE FOR CONCENTRATION IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND READING USELESS CRAP ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND I DON'T MEAN YOU IN PARTICULAR BUT ALL OF US AND THEN THINK HOW PRODUCTIVE THAT TIME COULD BE IF YOU WERE READING INSTEAD IT MIGHT HELP CHANGE USAGE HABITS AFTER CONSIDERING THIS FOR A FEW MONTHS I ALL MY SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS AND SPEND MUCH MORE TIME READING I'M A HAPPIER PERSON IN MY DAY-TO-DAY LIFE BECAUSE OF IT

LASTLY EXERCISE IT IS SO GOOD FOR YOUR MIND SERIOUSLY WORK THE BODY OUT TO MAKE THE MIND STRONGER I WAS A LITTLE LATE TO THE EXERCISE GAME HAVING BEEN FAIRLY SEDENTARY FOR MOST OF MY LIFE AND ONLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS STARTING TO EXERCISE REGULARLY I RUN AND DO BRAZILIAN BIU RITSU FIND SOMETHING PHYSICAL THAT YOU LIKE DOING AND DO IT AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE

I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ADD WHEN I WAS YEARS OLD AS WELL I AM NOW YEARS OLD AND I AM A COLLEGE INSTRUCTOR I HAVEN'T TAKEN MEDICATION SINCE I WAS YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY IMPROVE YOUR CONCENTRATION AND READING PRODUCTIVITY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FINDING THE THINGS THAT WORK BEST FOR YOU PERSONALLY

GOOD LUCK ON YOUR JOURNEY
THE HANGOVER THING IS SOMETHING I TOTALLY EXPERIENCE SOME OF MY BEST FOCUSED WORK IS DURING A HANGOVER SOME CAFFEINE FOR ABOUT 2 HRS FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD SOMEONE ELSE SAY SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT I HARDLY DRINK ANYMORE AND I THINK I LIKE THAT BETTER
I HAVE ADAD AND I AM THE ABSOLUTE WORST WHEN IT COMES TO READING RIGHT NOW I ONLY READ WHATEVER BOOKS I CAN EASILY STICK TO WHICH SUCKS BECAUSE I END UP THE SAME FIVE BOOKS OVER AND OVER WHILE HAVING A HARD TIME BEING ABLE TO PICK UP ANYTHING NEW

ONE THING THAT'S HELPED ME IS EITHER TO HAVE THE AUDIOBOOK OR TO READ OUT LOUD TO MYSELF WHICH IS USUALLY JUST MOUTHING THE WORDS AS I READ THEM THIS HAS PROBABLY LED TO WHY I ALSO LEAVE SUBTITLES ON TV MOVIES WHENEVER I WATCH THEM I ALSO TEND TO SKIP LINES SO I USE A BOOKMARK THAT I JUST FOLLOW EACH LINE WITH AS I READ IT WHICH SEEMS TO HELP
THE ONLY THING THAT ALLOWS ME TO READ IS MY ADAD MEDICINE
WEEKDAY ABOUT BOOKS ON TAPE THEN YOU CAN WALK OR DO SOMETHING WHILE LISTENING
HEY I'M AND I FEEL YOUR PAIN MAN ITS LIKE ONE MINUTE I'M READING AND THE NEXT MINUTE MY MIND IS SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT I STILL AM SCROLLING THROUGH THE PAGES BEFORE I KNOW IT I'VE READ A PAGE OR TWO WITHOUT EVEN PAYING ATTENTION TO WHATS ON IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK MEDITATION HAS HELPED ME HONE MY ABILITY TO FOCUS WHEN I AM READING MY BRAIN IS FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS FOCUSING ON ALOT OF THINGS HOLDING THE BOOK UP TRACKING MY EYES READING RECALLING FROM MEMORY WHAT THE WORDS MEAN GENERATING IMAGES EMOTIONS ETC WITH SUCH A NARROW FOCUS THE SURROUNDINGS FALL AWAY BUT THE NARRATIVE CAN EASILY BE DERAILED BY MY OWN THOUGHTS I HAVEN'T TRIED ZAZEN AND READING BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT HELP DO BE ACTIVE READ LIKE YOUR HAIR IS ON FIRE NOTHING HOLY ABOUT IT IS A REALLY GOOD BOOK BY A GUY WHO HAD TWO REALLY GREAT TEACHERS TELLING STORES ABOUT THEM I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WORKS BEST FOR ME OR ANYONE ELSE THOUGH AS I HAVE A HARD TIME PRACTISING GOOD LUCK AND KEEP ON COIN WHAT YOUR COIN RIGHT AND YEAH I GUESS I SHOULD DELETE REDDIN NOW DAMN
FUNNILY ENOUGH I USED TO READ AT THE EXPENSE OF PAYING ATTENTION UP THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL SINCE ABOUT MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL IVE BEEN ABLE TO PAY LESS AND LESS ATTENTION TO THE POINT WHERE I DONT EVEN WANT TO PICK UP A BOOK ANYMORE ITS SAD AND I REALLY DO MISS IT BUT I WAS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH ADD AT AND IM HOPEFUL MAYBE MEDICATION WILL RECTIFY THIS FOR ME ALONG WITH A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES
FUNNILY ENOUGH I USED TO READ AT THE EXPENSE OF PAYING ATTENTION UP THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL SINCE ABOUT MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL IVE BEEN ABLE TO PAY LESS AND LESS ATTENTION TO THE POINT WHERE I DONT EVEN WANT TO PICK UP A BOOK ANYMORE ITS SAD AND I REALLY DO MISS IT BUT I WAS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH ADD AT AND IM HOPEFUL MAYBE MEDICATION WILL RECTIFY THIS FOR ME ALONG WITH A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES
I FIND ISOLATING MYSELF WITH A BOOK OR JUST HAVING THE RIGHT BOOK DOES THE TRICK FOR ME IN BETWEEN CLASSES IS GREAT FOR ME TO READ BUT IF I THINK OF MY PHONE I'LL BE ON REDDIN INSTANTLY IT'S JUST ALL ABOUT NOT TAKING OUT THE PHONE OR READING IN FRONT OF MY COMPUTER
TL R TAKE A SMALL MINUTE BREAK WHEN FOCUS FATIGUE HAPPENS THEN TRY AGAIN


I FIND READING IS ABSOLUTELY DIFFICULT AFTER A FEW MINUTES IF I'M NOT MEDICATED OR HYPERFOCUSING


WHEN I FEEL MY FOCUS FADE OR START HAVING TO REREAD SENTENCES CONSTANTLY I JUST STOP LEAN BACK TAKE A BREAK FOR ABOUT MINUTES AND TRY IT AGAIN


USUALLY THOSE FEW MINUTES ARE ENOUGH TO HELP JUMP MY FOCUS A LITTLE AND IT GIVES ME TIME TO ABSORB WHAT I'VE JUST READ SO IT'S A WIN WIN ESPECIALLY SICE I TEND TO MISS A LOT OF LITTLE DETAILS
READING IN THE BATH IS THE ONLY TIME I CAN READ ATM IT'S SO RELAXING THAT I ZONE NICELY INTO THE BOOK
IT TAKES ME MINUTES OF REREADING LINES REPEATEDLY BEFORE I AM ABLE TO FOCUS AND ABSORB EACH LINE AS I GO ALSO I CANNOT USE PC PHONES TABLETS TO READ IT MUST BE AN ACTUAL BOOK OTHERWISE I'LL CATCH MYSELF OR OPENING A BROWSER TO MESS AROUND WITHIN MINUTES
PRACTICE DISCIPLINE I STRUGGLE WITH MY ADAD AND BARE READ A SINGLE BOOK FOR THE LAST 2 YEARS THIS YEAR I KNUCKLED DOWN SET A GOAL AND STUCK TO IT
I JUST FINISHED MY OF IT'S POSSIBLE BUT THERE ARE VERY FEW SHORTCUTS OR HACKS IN MY EXPERIENCE

MAKING A GOAL AND THEN A WAY OF TRACKING IT EG KEEPS YOU ACCOUNTABLE THAT HELPS
I HAVE ADAD AND READING WAS BASICALLY MY COPING MECHANISM IN SCHOOL I'VE FOUND I NEED A COUPLE THINGS TO FOCUS ON AT THE SAME TIME ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING THAT I'M ALLOWED TO FOCUS ON THAT ISN'T MY PRIMARY FOCUS THAT I CAN ABSORB A BIT OF BEFORE DIVING BACK IN

ALSO MOVING WHILE READING HELPS A BIT OR MOVING TO A NEW LOCATION TO READ WHEN YOUR ATTENTION FLAGS FOR ME LISTENING TO MUSIC AT HE SAME TIME HELPS TOO MORE OFTEN THAN NOT READING IS ONE OF MY DISTRACTIONS WHILE I TRY TO FOCUS ON WORK OR THE LIKE SO THEN I'M READING A PAGE OR THREE AND THEN GOING BACK TO WHATEVER ELSE
I HAVE ADAD AND I HAVE A REALLY EASY TIME READING IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I CAN FOCUS ON AND ZONE OUT IN
I DON'T HAVE ADAD BUT I'M PRETTY SURE I HAVE ADD OF SOME SORT I LOVE READING BUT OR SO PAGES IS MY MAX PER DAY BEFORE I START TO GET ANTSY IT REALLY GETS IN THE WAY OF ENJOYING BOOKS ESPECIALLY LARGER ONES
I HAVE ADD AND I JUST HAVE A KEEP A STACK OF BOOKS ON MY TABLE SO WHEN I GET BORED I JUST PICK UP ANOTHER BOOK I DO THAT LESS NOW BUT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I WOULD BE READING SIX OR SEVEN DIFFERENT BOOKS AT A TIME
I HAVE ADAD AND THAT IS SO TRUE IT TAKES ME FOREVER TO READ A BOOK BC MY MIND WANDERS WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE PLOT DYNAMICS TOO MUCH
FIRST OF ALL HYPERFOCUS IS COMMON IN MANY PEOPLE WITH ADAD SO ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU YOU CAN'T FOCUS IF YOU HAVE ADAD IS AN UNEDUCATED LOUT

UNTIL ABOUT FEW YEARS AGO MY DIAGNOSIS WAS ADAD AND I READ CHRONICALLY SINCE MY SECOND GRADE CHALLENGE TEACHER BOUGHT ME MY FIRST TWO BOOKS I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM READING OR FOCUSING ON READING EVEN IF IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CLASS I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TOO

I THINK MOVEMENT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT MAYBE INTERACTION WEB SITES MOVIES TV THEY MOVE YOU INTERACT WHEREAS READING IS REALLY NOT A LOT OF ANYTHING BUT EYES AND FOCUS
WHEN I GET DISTRACTED IT'S BECAUSE I'LL READ A SENTENCE WITHOUT REGISTERING IT AND END UP REREADING IT MULTIPLE TIMES AND STILL NOT GETTING IT BECAUSE I START FOCUSING ON NOT MISSING A PART OF THE BOOK THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT AND EVENTUALLY JUST GIVE UP ALTOGETHER WHAT ALLEVIATES THIS IS JUST LETTING SOME STUFF GO AND TRUSTING MY BRAIN TO RECORD IT WITHOUT ME CONSCIOUSLY FILING IT AWAY FOR LATER I END UP ENJOYING READING A LOT MORE IF I LET MYSELF GO ON AUTOPILOT FOR A BIT WITHOUT STRESSING OVER IT
TRY PUTTING YOUR PHONE OR COMPUTER ON DO NOT DISTURB MODE OR EVEN TURN THEM OFF WHILE READING LESS DISTRACTIONS ALSO FIND THE TIME OF DAY WHEN YOU CAN FOCUS MORE ON THE BOOK AS IN THE MORNING IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU FOR ME I USUALLY CAN READ FROM ABOUT TO MIDNIGHT IF I'M NOT DISTRACTED THAT'S MY FAVORITE TIME TO READ ANY OTHER TIME I LOSE FOCUS
SAME HERE BUT ADDENDUM SOMETIMES I WISH I COULD GET BACK ON MY ADDERALL BUT I HATE HOW WELL IT WORKS LOL IT MAKES ME A ZOMBIE FOR A GOOD HOURS WHICH IS GREAT FOR NEEDING TO CONCENTRATE ON ONE THING AT A TIME SO I USUALLY JUST SUPPLEMENT IT WITH COFFEE OR AN ENERGY DRINK DOESN'T WORK NEARLY AS WELL BUT IT HELPS ANOTHER THING I HAVE TO DO IS TURN MY PHONE OFF AND PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM OR ELSE I WILL GET ON IT AND END UP MINDLESSLY SCROLLING THROUGH GOODREADS OR REDDIN OR FACEBOOK FOR HOURS
THE COMBINATION OF FISH OIL AND PRIMROSE OIL REALLY HELPED ME I DIDN'T LIKE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE PRESCRIBED MEDICATION SO I LOOKED INTO HERBAL REMEDIES
THERE ARE THREE PLACES I READ

ON THE BUS TRAIN

IN BED BEFORE FALLING ASLEEP

ON THE TOILET TAKING A SHIT
COFFEE MAKES READING HARDER FOR ME I AM ALREADY EASILY DISTRACTED AND COFFEE SENDS ME OFF INTO MY OWN THOUGHTS AND GETS MY BRAIN RUNNING IN ALL DIRECTIONS I USUALLY SMOKE WEED BEFORE READING MOST PEOPLE SAY THEY CAN T FOCUS WHEN HIGH BUT FOR ME IT LETS ME GET LASER FOCUSED ON THE BOOK AND SHUT OUT ALL OTHER THOUGHTS TO GET FULLY IMMERSED
THIS POST WAS TO LONG I LOST MY CONCENTRATION
I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I SMOKED TOO MUCH WEED HAVEN'T READ THE WHOLE POST HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS TO ASK ANYONE FREE
HAVING READ ALL ABSOIL BOOKS I WANTED TO CHIME IN ON YOUR REMARK ABOUT THEM BEING IDEALISTIC LIKE TZOLKIN I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE THEM THAT WAY THEY STRIKE ME AS BEING MUCH MORE REALISTIC IT'S NOT STRICTLY GOOD VS EVIL LIKE TZOLKIN I DID ENJOY THEM AND YOU MAY TOO BUT I THOUGHT I'D PITCH IN BEFORE YOU BOUGHT THE WHOLE SET
IDEALISM IS THE LAST THING I THINK OF WHEN I THINK OF A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE
YOU NEED TO MAKE PARAGRAPHS WHEN YOU SWITCH TRAINS OF THOUGHT ALSO LZ
WELL IF YOU LIKE THE NARNIA BOOKS YOU SHOULD TRY THE PRYDAIN SERIES BY LLOYD ALEXANDER I ENJOYED THEM A LOT MORE THAN LEWIS WORK

COOL THAT THE RAMAYANA IS MENTIONED I READ WHAT I THINK IS AN ABRIDGED VERSION IT'S PRETTY NEAT TO READ A MYTHOLOGY WITH SUCH A DIFFERENT POWER STRUCTURE TO MOST WESTERN MYTHOLOGY
I HAVE SINCE MADE A CLOSE FRIEND WHO LOVES THE SONG OF ICE AND FIRE AND FROM WHAT I KNOW OF IT FROM HER IT CLEARLY HAS LOTS OF THE SORT OF IDEALISM I WAS LOOKING FOR

LOL WHAT NUMBER JUST NUMBER IT IS THE UTTER OPPOSITE OF IDEALISTIC
I WOULD REALLY ADVICE YOU TO READ THE CORUM BOOKS BY MICHEAL MOORCOCK ESPECIALLY THE BOOK CORUM
TO ME THEY HAVE THE FEELING OF MIDDLE-EARTH IN THE 2ND AGE
I'VE REALLY ENJOYED THE SYRIA BOOKS BY MICHAEL J SULLIVAN THEY FEEL DEEPLY IMAGINED THEY HAVE A HOPEFULNESS AND THEY ARE JUST GREAT FUN ALSO SULLIVAN WRITES A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY FROM MOST ACTUALLY FINISHES THE ENTIRE SERIES BEFORE HE RELEASES THE FIRST ONE SO HIS NEW BOOK AGE OF MYTH IS THE FIRST OF A SERIES THAT WILL BE RELEASED PREDICTABLY AND REGULARLY NO WORRIES THAT HE'LL DRAG YOU INTO THIS WORLD AND THEN HAVE A AND NOT FINISH IT MY FEAR WITH SONG OF ICE AND FIRE
I'M GLAD YOU FOUND YOUR FIX EVEN IF IT DID TAKE TWO YEARS HAHA

I FINISHED THE RETURN OF THE KING LITERALLY LAST NIGHT I'VE BEEN SCANNING MY SHELVES ALL MORNING PICKING UP VARIOUS BOOKS TO TRY AND FIND SOMETHING THAT COULD MEASURE UP TO LOAR

LUCKILY I FOUND SOMETHING WINTER OF THE WORLD BY KEN FOLLETT SECOND BOOK IN THE CENTURY TRILOGY I'D READ THE FIRST A MONTH OR SO AGO IT'S PERFECT FOR ME AS I REALLY FEEL LIKE I NEED SOMETHING WITH A WIDE SCOPE AND BIG THEMES AFTER FINISHING LOAR
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND MICHAEL MOORCOCK AND HIS VARIOUS ETERNAL CHAMPION SERIES I WOULD SUGGEST STARTING WITH THE ALRIC SAGA HE IS LITERALLY AS HE ACTIVELY SAUGHT TO CHANGE THE BRITISH SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY LANDSCAPE
SINCE YOU MENTIONED THE RAMAYANA I SUGGEST YOU SHOULD PICK UP A COPY OF THE MAHABHARATA YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DELVE DEEPER INTO THIS OTHERWORLDLY MYSTICAL IDEALISM YOU LIKE

AND IF YOU WANT TO DIP YOUR TOES IN REAL WORLD IDEALISM OF SORTS AFTER ALL SAID WORLD IS CARRIED BY FOUR GIANT ELEPHANTS WHO IN TURN ARE CARRIED BY A GIANT TURTLE THEN TRY TERRY DISCWORLD SERIES
IT'S FUN THAT YOU LIKE CHRISTIAN APOLOGISE AND HINDU POETRY
A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE IS A REALLY GOOD SERIES WHEN I READ ALL THE BOOKS THEN READ THE HOBBIT I FOUND IT TO BE REALLY BORING IT'S HARD FOR ME TO CONTINUE READING COMPARED TO EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON IN ASOCIAL ALSO ASOCIAL ISN'T IDEAL
LIBRARY CHECK OUTS NO MORE NEED TO DRIVE TO THE LIBRARY JUST LOG ON AND DOWNLOAD YOUR BOOKS IF I FIND A VERY FAVORITE I'LL STILL BUY THE HARD COPY
YOU CAN CARRY A THOUSAND BOOKS AT ONCE THERE ARE TIMES I'M READING FOUR OR FIVE BOOKS AT ONCE I ALSO CAN MOVE RIGHT ON TO ANOTHER BOOK WHEN I FINISH WHAT I'M READING EVEN IF I'M AT WORK OR A RESTAURANT OR SOMETHING
I LIKE HOW I CAN READ IN BED WITH THE LIGHTS OFF I REALLY LIKE READING AT NIGHT BUT HAVING THE LIGHT ON BOTHERS MY PARTNER WHO WAKES AT FOR WORK AS YOU SAID MANY CLASSICS CAN BE FOUND FOR A VERY LOW PRICE ALSO I'VE NOTICED THAT A TON OF RECIPE BOOKS ARE EITHER FREE OR LESS THAN WHILE THE PRINT VERSION IS I LIKE HOW I CAN TOSS IT INTO MY PURSE AND NOT HAVING TO CARRY AROUND A WEIGHTY BOOK I DO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH BOOKS I BUY IN PRINT AND WHICH I BUY ON THE KINDLE SO MY LIBRARY IS A MIX OF BOTH BUT IT HELPS KEEP MY BOOKSHELF FROM GETTING OVERWHELMED ALSO YOU CAN DOWNLOAD NETFLIX HULU HBO APPS SO I USE IT AS A LITTLE PORTABLE TV WHENEVER I'M DOING CHORES SUPER USEFUL
I AM NEVER WITHOUT A DOZEN BOOKS OKAY HUNDREDS IF I FORGET MY KINDLE AND WIND UP IN A WAITING AREA OR WITH DOWNTIME MY PHONE HAS THE KINDLE APP WITH ALL THE SAME BOOKS EVEN BETTER THE BOOK FROM THE KINDLE ON MY NIGHT STAND SYNCS WITH THE PHONE APP SO I CAN OPEN THE BOOK TO THE SAME PAGE I LEFT OFF ANYWHERE I AM ON ANY DEVICE I HAVE

AMAZON OFFERS FREE SAMPLES OF ALL KINDLE BOOKS I USUALLY DOWNLOAD A SAMPLE OF ANY BOOK AND READ THAT BEFORE I DECIDE TO BUY THAT'S PREVENTED ME FROM BUYING SOME BAD BOOKS

THE KINDLE ALLOWS ME TO SORT BOOKS INTO COLLECTIONS SO I CAN ORGANIZE MY VIRTUAL BOOKSHELF ANY WAY I WANT SINCE IT'S DIGITAL BOOKS ARE SEARCHABLE THE KINDLE ALSO ALLOWS ME TO HIGHLIGHT PASSAGES AND TAKE NOTES WHICH IS GREAT FOR BOOK CLUB AND IF I FIND AN ERROR LIKE A TYPO THERE'S EVEN AN EASY WAY TO REPORT IT TO HAVE AMAZON CORRECT IT
2 THINGS THAT WILL NEVER HAVE ME GOING BACK TO PHYSICAL BOOKS

NO WRIST STRAIN I CAN USE ONE HAND OFTEN WITHOUT A THUMB TO HOLD MY TABLET TO READ I DON'T NEED TO HOLD THE PAGES OPEN

2 TIME LEFT IN CHAPTER BOOK FEATURE I KNOW IF I CAN SNEAK ANOTHER CHAPTER BEFORE NEEDING TO LEAVE HOUSE OR GO TO SLEEP AND I KNOW IF I WILL BE FINISHING THE CURRENT BOOK I AM READING DURING MY NEXT LONG READING SESSION AND THUS WILL NEED TO HAVE A NEW BOOK LINED UP
I RESISTED GETTING A KINDLE FOR YEARS BECAUSE LIKE YOU I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD COMPARE TO PHYSICAL BOOKS BUT ONCE I GAVE IN I WAS SO GLAD I DID FOR A REASON NO ONE ELSE HAS MENTIONED I AM A LITTLE OLDER AND MY EYES AREN'T AS SHARP AS THEY USED TO BE AND I'VE FOUND THAT BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE FONT SIZE AND HAVING A BACKLIT SCREEN MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO READ WITHOUT EYESTRAIN
I WOULD HAVE LOVED ONE WHEN TRAVELLING FOR YEARS NOW THAT FITTING ALL MY POSSESSIONS IN A BACKPACK ISN'T A NEED
MOVING HOUSE ONE TOO MANY TIMES
YOU'RE SAVING A FAIR AMOUNT OF PAPER
NOT A KINDLE BUT READ WITH A TABLET WITH EXCEPTIONS FOR BOOKS WITH A LOT OF DIAGRAMS AND OR ILLUSTRATIONS THAT I WILL KEEP FLIPPING TO

FINISH A BOOK HALFWAY THROUGH MY LUNCH BREAK THAT WAS A RIPPER SECONDS LATER I'M READING THE SECOND BOOK IN THE SERIES

THE DICTIONARY WAS SUPER HELPFUL WHEN READING GAME OF THRONES LOTS OF OLD ARMOUR AND WEAPONRY I HAD NEVER HEARD OF CAUGHT MYSELF ABOUT TO USE IT ON A HARD COPY BOOK ONCE

JUST THE EASE OF BROWSING AND GETTING A BOOK BEING NOTIFIED WHEN AN AUTHOR I LIKE RELEASES ANOTHER ONE SEARCH FOR A SPECIFIC WORD PHRASE
INSTANT ACCESS TO WIKIPEDIA AND DICTIONARY IS INVALUABLE FOR THE TYPES OF BOOKS I READ X-RAY IS FANTASTIC TOO I LIKE THE HIGHLIGHT FEATURE DUMPING ALL YOUR HIGHLIGHTS INTO A SINGLE FILE WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED ON A PC I ALSO LIKE TO READ A BOOK ON KINDLE FIRST BEFORE I DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO BUY A FANCY HARDBACK SOMETHING I RESERVE ONLY FOR THE BEST BOOKS I READ A KINDLE ALSO ALLOWS ME TO BUY A BOOK IMMEDIATELY INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR A PHYSICAL COPY TO ARRIVE BECAUSE SOMETIMES I DECIDE I WANT TO READ SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE IT ACTUALLY ARRIVES
I THOUGHT I WAS A PURIST AS WELL BUT KINDLE IS JUST SO MUCH BETTER
FLASH SALES ON KINDLE BOOKS ARE AMAZING I HAVE A RUNNING WISH LIST FOR KINDLE BOOKS THAT I LITERALLY CHECK ONCE A DAY YOU'D BE AMAZED AT HOW MANY BOOKS I PICK UP FOR THAT ARE USUALLY

BTW NO BETTER TIME TO SEE THIS THAN TOMORROW BLACK FRIDAY I USUALLY WILL PICK UP KINDLE BOOKS FOR NO MORE THAN TOTAL
CONVENIENCE
I USE MY KOBO FOR TWO PURPOSES

TO READ BOOKS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SENT ME TO REVIEW AND
2 FOR WHEN I TRAVEL

WHENEVER I GO AWAY ON TRIPS ESPECIALLY OVERSEAS WITH LONG FLIGHTS I USUALLY PACK A BUNCH OF BOOKS BUY BOOKS AT THE AIRPORT BUY BOOKS AT MY DESTINATION YOU GET THE PICTURE MY ENTIRE LUGGAGE ALLOWANCE ENDS UP BEING USED ON BOOKS MY KOBO SAVES ME EXTRA BAGGAGE COSTS AND THE WEIGHT OF LUGGING A TRILLION BOOKS EVERYWHERE I GO
ASIDE FROM THE EXTREME CONVENIENCE THE SALES THAT AMAZON HAS ARE A BIG SELLING POINT FOR ME I'VE READ SOME GREAT BOOKS SOME OF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE OTHERWISE NOT READ FOR ONLY TWO OR THREE DOLLARS

ALSO IF YOU HAVE AMAZON PRIME I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE I DON'T RIGHT NOW YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO USE YOUR KINDLE TO BORROW A FREE BOOK FROM THE AMAZON LENDING LIBRARY EVERY MONTH

AND LIKE WAS MENTIONED ALREADY BEING ABLE TO READ THINGS LIKE THE COMPLETE COLLECTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WITHOUT BREAKING MY WRIST IS AWESOME
I JUST LOVE THE FACT THAT I CAN READ BEFORE BEDTIME AND NOT HAVE TO WALK OVER TO SWITCH THE LIGHTS OFF

ALSO THERE'S SO MUCH DECLUTTERING OF MY ROOM AFTER I SWITCHED TO KINDLE
WELL ASIDE FROM THE SPACE THING IS THE COST THING E BOOKS ARE CHEAPER THAN HARD BACKS OFTEN CHEAPER THAN PAPER BACKS I READ BOOKS AND STORIES FOR THE WORDS THE IDEAS WHICH DON'T CHANGE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDIUM THE ONLY BOOKS I STILL BUY THESE DAYS ARE IMPULSE BUYS AND BOOKS BOTH MY WIFE AND I WILL READ SINCE SHARING BOOKS IS A DIFFICULT ACT

I NEVER REALLY CARED ABOUT THE COVER OF A BOOK AND DON'T SEE HOW IT RELATES TO THE STORY ITSELF SO I'M NOT SURE HOW IT'S A CONSIDERATION
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH U DISAPPOINTINGOUTCOME

YOU CAN HAVE ON HAND AS MANY AS YOU WANT ASSUMING YOU HAVE YOUR DEVICE WITH YOU IF YOU USE CERTAIN SERVICES YOU CAN READ THE BOOKS WHERE YOU LEFT OFF ON PC ANDROID IOS ETC IT GENERALLY IS A CONVENIENCE THING A LOT OF THE TIME BOOK APPLICATIONS COME WITH SOME KIND OF MARKUP TOOLS YOU CAN DO
IF YOU'RE A PERSON LIKE ME WHO LIKES TO READ LIKE HISTORY OR PHILOSOPHY BUT DON'T HAVE THE ATTENTION SPAN TO STICK TO JUST ONE THING OR LIKE TO LOOK UP VARIOUS THINGS ON THE FLY THEN IT'S AMAZING I HAVE DOZENS OF TEXTS ON MY KINDLE WHICH I CAN BRING UP WHENEVER I'M CURIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING
I PERSONALLY GET VERY OCD ABOUT THE CONDITION OF MY BOOKS WHEN I PUT THEN IN MY BAG AND GO PLACES THEY GET SCRATCHED OR BENT AND IT DRIVES ME CRAZY SO I USUALLY PREFER TO TAKE A KINDLE WHEN I GO OUT
WHEN I DEPLOYED MY I'VE LONG SINCE REPLACED IT WAS INVALUABLE TO ME I LOVE PHYSICAL BOOKS AND I HAVE A CRAP TON OF THEM BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM FOR THEM IN SMALLER CRAMPED QUARTERS YOU FREQUENTLY SHARE HAVING A TON OF BOOKS OR AT A MOMENTS NOTICE WAS GREAT
IT IS CONVENIENT
I ALSO BUY THE MAJORITY OF MY BOOKS IN A PHYSICAL COPY BUT A KINDLE WHEN YOU ARE TRAVELLING EVEN FOR ONE BOOK IT'S EASIER TO CARRY I MEAN PAGES BOOKS TO CARRY ON A PLANE OR TRAIN ARE NOT SO EASY KINDLE ASIDE FROM THE FLASH DISCOUNT FOR MANY BOOK HAS REALLY INTERESTING PRICES A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO I BOUGHT LIKE PHILIP KING DICK BOOKS FOR IF YOU WANT TO READ A BOOK BUT THE PHYSICAL EDITION PRICE IS TOO HIGH YOU CAN BUY IT FOR HALF THE PRICE AND IN THE END IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE SOME BOOKS ARE ONLY IN DIGITAL
FOR ME IT WAS THE FACT I CAN GET THE KINDLE EASILY IN MY HANDBAG I CAN ALWAYS LINE UP THE NEXT BOOK TO START AND DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TIL I GET HOME THAT SIZE OF A VOLUME NO LONGER MATTERS THAT I CAN GET FOREIGN LANGUAGE TITLES FOR THE SAME MONEY AND CAN EASILY FIND THEM THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS AND IT SERIOUSLY HELPED ME READ ON MY COMMUTE
I LIVE IN ARGENTINA AND THERE ARE QUITE A FEW BOOKS I WANT TO READ BUT I CAN'T GET IN BOOKSHOPS AROUND HERE YET AND PHYSICAL IMPORTS ARE TROUBLESOME AROUND HERE LESS SO THAN A YEAR AGO BUT STILL TROUBLESOME NOT TO MENTION MORE EXPENSIVE
MY FIRST PROBLEM WHEN I WAS THINKING OF BUYING AN BOOK READER WAS THE SCREEN DISPLAYS ARE JUST AWESOME I CAN READ FOR STRAIGHT HOURS NON STOP AND MY EYES ARE FINE NOT HOLDING AN ACTUAL BOOK IS A BIT STRANGE BUT AFTER A WHILE YOU'RE GETTING USED TO IT AND I BELIEVE YOU'LL LOVE IT
BOOK READING CHANGED THE WAY I READ COMPLETELY IF I THINK A BOOK I'M READING ALLUDES TO ANOTHER BOOK I'VE READ I CALL THAT UP IN MY DEVICE AND SEARCH THE TEXT WITH KEYWORDS EFFORTLESSLY IMMEDIATELY WITH PAPER BOOKS I'M LESS LIKELY TO DO THAT AS IT'S TOO MUCH WORK I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THE BOOK I MAY NOT REMEMBER WHERE IN THE BOOK THE RELEVANT PASSAGE IS

IF I'M CHATTING WITH SOMEONE ABOUT A TOPIC THAT I'VE READ ABOUT I KNOW I CAN EASILY SEARCH MY BOOK LIBRARY AND REFERENCE AND RECOMMEND THE BOOK EVEN EMAIL A FEW PAGES

IF A PASSAGE OR A CONCEPT IS IMPORTANT OR DIFFICULT I CAN SEND IT TO A TXT FILE WITH A DRAG AND A TAP AND I CAN OPEN THAN FILE ON MY PHONE AND PASSIVELY LISTEN TO THE PASSAGE WITH WHEN I COMMUTE

WHICH MEANS I'M A LOT MORE LIKELY TO GO BACK TO REUSE BOOKS I'VE READ

AND EVEN ON FIRST READ OF ANY BOOK I INVOLUNTARILY TRY TO REMEMBER KEYWORDS AND PHRASING THAT WILL HELP ME SEARCH IF I NEED THE MATERIALS AGAIN BECAUSE I MY BOOK LIBRARY SO REGULARLY AND SOMETIMES I STRUGGLE TO FIND WHAT I NEED AND GET REALLY FRUSTRATED THAT SEARCH EXPERIENCE TRAINED ME TO ACTIVELY PROCESS AND CATEGORIZE MATERIALS AS I READ

HIGHLIGHTING DIDN'T USED TO DO MUCH FOR ME IN A PRINTED TEXT SENDING ALL THE HIGHLIGHTED PASSAGES AS A TEXT FILE THAT I CAN LISTEN TO EDIT REVIEW MAKES HIGHLIGHTING FAR MORE USEFUL

ON A TABLET I USE APPS THAT ALLOWS ME TO PLAY WITH ITEMS I'VE HIGHLIGHTED REARRANGE THEM LIKE FLASHCARDS OR MINDMAPS

TL R BOOKS REDUCED THE BARRIER TO REUSE MATERIALS I'VE READ SO I FEEL LIKE I OWN THE CONTENTS A LOT MORE THAN WITH PRINTED BOOKS WHICH GIVE ME A VAGUE SENSE OF HAVING READ SOMETHING BUT FEELS IMPOSSIBLE TO FISH OUT THE RIGHT BOOK RIGHT CHAPTER RIGHT CONCEPT FROM BOXES UNDER MY BED OR WORSE YET ON LOAN TO A FRIEND OR RETURNED TO THE LIBRARY
YOU CAN CARRY SO MANY BOOKS SWITCH BETWEEN THEM QUICKLY AND IT'S LIGHT I CAN HAVE ONE IN MY PURSE AT ALL TIMES I'VE OFTEN BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE A PHYSICAL BOOK IN MY BAG AS WELL BUT THAT BECOMES DIFFICULT WHEN THE BOOK YOU'RE READING IS A HARDCOVER

THAT'S PARTICULARLY HANDY WHEN I WANT TO READ A NEW RELEASE THAT IS ONLY OUT IN HARDCOVER BUT I DON'T WANT TO CARRY AROUND A HEAVY BOOK

ALSO THAT I CAN READ IN BED WITHOUT BOTHERING MY PARTNER IS GREAT SHE DOES THE SAME SOMETIMES
I COMMENTED EARLIER IN FAVOR OF THE KINDLE BUT ONE MAJOR CAVEAT FOR ME I AM A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER BY PROFESSION I WOULD NEVER BUY A TECHNICAL BOOK WITH CODE EXAMPLES FOR THE KINDLE I FIND THE ANY NON TRIVIAL EXAMPLE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW I WONDER IF OTHER FOLKS HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH TECHNICAL MANUALS IN KINDLE FORM
I USED MY KINDLE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOR A FEW YEARS UNTIL I GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I MISSED GOING TO A BOOKSTORE AND HOLDING A PHYSICAL BOOK IN MY HAND NOW I USE MY KINDLE FOR READING AT NIGHT CHECKING OUT LIBRARY BOOKS AND BUYING UP FLASH SALE BOOKS I EMPHATICALLY NEED BOTH IN MY LIFE
NIGHT TIME READING IS EASIER


YOU CAN TAKE A BUNCH OF BOOKS WITH YOU WHEN TRAVELING



YOU CAN READ WHILE DOING CARDIO AT THE GYM MORE EASILY



SOME BOOKS ARE A LOT CHEAPER
DON'T HAVE A KINDLE MYSELF I'VE ALWAYS RESISTED THE IDEA BECAUSE I TOO ENJOY THE FEEL SMELL AND ACT OF HOLDING A BOOK PLUS THE IDEA OF STARING AT SCREENS FOR EVEN MORE THAN IN NEED TO IN A DAY THAN I NEED TO AFTER TV AND WORK COMPUTER ETC HAS ALWAYS TURNED ME OFFICIAL

HOWEVER AFTER READING THESE RESPONSES I MAY NEED TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY GOOD CYBER MONDAY DEALS FOR KINDLES
A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE SAID BELOW SAY GOODBYE TO BULK TO DISCOMFORT WHEN READING LONG BOOKS TO HAVING TO FLICK AHEAD TO SEE HOW FAR TO THE NEXT CHAPTER BUT ALSO FOR ME IT DIDN'T ENTIRELY REPLACE PAPERBACKS I STILL LOVE REAL BOOKS BUT HAVING EASY AND CHEAP ACCESS TO SO MANY HAS MEANT I SEE PHYSICAL BOOKS AS TREATS NOW WHICH IS KIND OF A NICE SIDE EFFECT
I TEND TO PREFER MY DREADER TO PAPER BOOKS ALL THE TIME EXCELLENT LIGHTING CONVENIENCE PREFECT FONT AND FONT SIZE ETC BUT WHEN I'M READING A LONG HEAVY BOOK THAT PREFERENCE IS EVEN GREATER IT'S ALL ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL PREFERENCE THOUGH I WOULD ALWAYS SUGGEST BINK READERS THOUGH NOT A NORMAL TABLET MUCH MORE PLEASANT ON THE EYES IMO
DECISIVE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF KINDLE MY FIRST CATARACT AT SIX YEARS AGO AND GENERALLY A POOR SIGHT BEING ABLE TO DETERMINE THE SIZE OF CHARACTERS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME

WHILE I LIKE BOOKS I NEVER WORSHIPED THEM AS OBJECTS I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE WORDS THAN IN THE COVER OR IN THE FORMAT

I LIKE PHYSICAL FORMAT FOR BOOKS I'M GONNA READ OVER AND OVER AGAIN OR PERUSE NOW AND THEN IN MY CASE RECREATIONAL MATH BOOKS AND BOOKS ABOUT PLANTS AND FLOWERS

FOR NARRATIVE ESPECIALLY LIKE MOST OF THRILLERS I ACTUALLY DO NOT SEE NO MORE THE NEED OF WASTING SPACE ON OUR ALREADY OVERCROWDED SHELVES PROBABLY I HAVE BOOKS AND MY WIFE

I ACTUALLY PREFER BOTH DEPENDING ON WHEN AND WHERE AT WORK KINDLE I'M A LITTLE OCD ABOUT THE CONDITION OF MY BOOKS SO I ALWAYS BOUGHT THE HARDCOVER VERSION FOR AT HOME AND THE PAPERBACK VERSION FOR MY COMMUTE WORK NOW I BASICALLY DO THE SAME BUT INSTEAD OF THE PAPERBACK VERSION I BUY THE BOOK AT HOME I STILL PREFER THE WEIGHT FEEL AND SMELL OF MY HARDCOVER BOOKS IN BED IT'S THE KINDLE AGAIN

SO YEA YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONVERT GET THE BEST FROM BOTH WORLDS
TRAVEL IS THE PLUS TO ME I HAVE PRETTY MUCH GONE COMPLETELY KINDLE WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF EXCEPTIONS THE LAST FEW YEARS ALTHOUGH WHEN I DO GET A NEW HARD COPY THERE IS THAT NEW BOOK SMELL AHH
ITS JUST A MATTER OF PREFERENCE I GOT AN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND I PREFER MY HARD COPIES TO IT
PROS

BACKLIGHT ALLOWS READING IN THE DARK GOOD IF YOU HAVE A SPOUSE TRYING TO SLEEP OR NO LIGHT NEARBY
COMFORTABLE TO HOLD ONE HANDED OR TO SET ON A SURFACE FOR HANDS FREE READING ASIDE FROM TURNING THE PAGE
LIGHTWEIGHT REGARDLESS OF LENGTH OF BOOK NOT AS INTIMIDATING TO TACKLE A VERY LONG BOOK
EASY BOOKMAKING JUST CLOSE IT OR TURN IT OFF
EASY NAVIGATING USING INDEXES FOOTNOTES SOURCES
BUILT IN DICTIONARY REALLY USEFUL HELPS BUILD VOCABULARY AND COMPREHENSION OF HARDER BOOKS
CARRY ENTIRE LIBRARY WITH YOU ON ONE SMALL DEVICE
CAN USE CALIBRE TO KEEP LIBRARY BOOKS INDEFINITELY AND OR STRIP DSM FROM PURCHASED BOOKS SO YOU OWN AN YOU'VE PURCHASED NOT AMAZON KOBO ETC
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DAMAGING PHYSICAL COPIES BY PUTTING THEM IN YOUR POCKET BAG
CONVENIENCE OF NOT HAVING TO GO TO A STORE WHEN YOU WANT A SPECIFIC BOOKS NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT STORE HAVING BOOK IN STOCK
AMAZON KINDLE LIBRARY IS LARGE AND ONLY THE MOST UNCOMMON OR OBSCURE BOOKS USUALLY CAN'T BE FOUND
DECLUTTERS YOUR HOME

CONS

SOMETIME BOOKS HAVE TYPOS DUE TO TEXT RECOGNITION SOFTWARE CAN BE EDITED AND CORRECTED WITH CALIBRE IF IT REALLY BOTHERS YOU REALLY ONLY A PROBLEM WITH OLDER BOOKS NEW BOOKS USUALLY EXIST IN PERFECT DIGITAL VERSIONS
NO BOOKS TO DISPLAY ON A SHELF IF YOU CARE ABOUT THAT
DOESN'T SMELL AS GOOD
HARD TO QUICKLY REVIEW MAPS IN FANTASY BOOKS
I USE A KINDLE BECAUSE MY EYESIGHT IS BAD AND I CAN SET THE TYPE TO LARGE PRINTING
I USE BOTH SOMETIMES I WANT TO READ A BOOK STRAIGHT AWAY SO I JUST DOWNLOAD IT OR IF I TRAVEL I CAN TAKE A PHYSICAL BOOK BUT ALSO HAVE THE WITH A BACK UP BOOK SOME SHORT STORIES POETRY WHATEVER REALLY
FOR ME THE BENEFITS OF A KINDLE OVER A PHYSICAL BOOK ARE

TAKES LESS STORAGE SPACE FOR A PERSONAL LIBRARY

ADJUSTABLE FONT SIZE AND FONT MAKES READING EASIER ON THE EYES

THERE IS A GREATER SPACE FOR NOTE TAKING

I DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE MY HOUSE TO GO TO A BOOKSTORE TO BUY A BOOK OR WAIT TWO DAYS FOR DELIVERY IF I ORDERED FROM AMAZON
IF YOU DO TRANSFER TO DIGITAL READING GO FOR AN IPAD NOT A KINDLE
TRAVEL

YEARS AGO I WENT ON A WEEK TRIP THROUGH INDIA AND AND LITERALLY HALF OF MY GIANT BACKPACK WAS TAKEN UP WITH READING MATERIAL AFTER LUGGING THAT AROUND WITH ME EVERYWHERE I BOUGHT A KINDLE PRETTY MUCH AS SOON AS I GOT HOME
I USED TO BE HARD COPY PURIST BUT I BOUGHT KINDLE THANKS TO KINDLE YOU CAN BRING MANY BOOKS WITH YOU IF YOU HAVE VISUAL IMPAIRMENT LIKE MYOPIC YOU CAN SET THE SIZE OF THE LETTERS AND THE MARGIN IT IS EASY TO HOLD SO YOU CAN READ BOOKS WHENEVER YOU WANT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP BUYING HARD COPIES I STILL BUY HARD COPIES OF SOME BOOKS
I'M THE SAME WAY I HAVE AN DREADER AND I NEVER USE IT IT JUST SITS ON THE SHELF GATHERING DUST AND PEOPLE BORROW IT SOMETIMES I'D RATHER CRACK OPEN AN OLD BOOK I'VE ALREADY READ AND REREAD IT THAN READ AN INTERESTING NEW BOOK ON MY DREADER

I WOULD RECOMMEND READING TO YOUR OWN STYLE
PROJECT GUTENBERG I READ THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW AND A BUNCH OF EDGAR ALLEN POE THIS HALLOWEEN A CHRISTMAS CAROL LAST XMAS ETC OVERDRIVE IS STILL MY MAIN SOURCE BUT I LOVE THIS SITE
I WAS RELUCTANT TO USE A KINDLE AT FIRST BUT AFTER GETTING ONE AS A GIFT I FELL IN LOVE I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ROOM SO IT'S NICE TO SAVE MY BOOKSHELF SPACE FOR THE STUFF I WANT MOST AS HARD COPIES I PREFER TO USE HARD COPIES FOR THINGS WITH LOTS OF IMAGES LIKE DRAWING GUIDES AND REFERENCE BOOKS HARD TO FLIP BACK AND FORTH ON A KINDLE HA HA JUST AS WELL A LOT OF THOSE BOOKS AREN'T AVAILABLE IN DIGITAL FORMAT ANYWAY A SMALL THIN KINDLE IS EASIER TO CARRY AROUND THAN SOME BULKY BOOKS I DIDN'T GET A CAR UNTIL RECENTLY SO THE SIZE WEIGHT WAS EXTRA IMPORTANT FOR QUITE A WHILE IF YOU'RE TRAVELING AWAY FROM HOME FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND THUS MAY END UP READING A LOT OF BOOKS THE SMALL SIZE IS ONCE AGAIN USEFUL IT'S COOL TO BE ABLE TO BUY AND DOWNLOAD NEW BOOKS INSTANTLY ESPECIALLY GOOD IF YOU CAN'T GO OUT FOR SOME REASON AND IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO START A NEW BOOK RIGHT AFTER FINISHING A DIFFERENT ONE

I RECENTLY BOUGHT A NEW KINDLE FIRST ONE BROKE I WAS DEVASTATED AND IT HAS A TOUCHSCREEN I WAS HESITANT TO GET IT SINCE I WAS SO USED TO THE BUTTONS OF MY PREVIOUS KINDLE BUT I'M REALLY ENJOYING THE FEATURE WHERE YOU CAN PRESS A WORD AND IT BRINGS UP THE DICTIONARY ENTRY HA HA
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT AS YOU IN PREFERRING HARD COPIES TO BUT AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO GET AN IT'S COMPACT AND A LOT OF THE CLASSICS EXIST AS FREE ON AMAZON I HAVE NOT YET FOUND IT WORTH THE INVESTMENT SO I'VE JUST BEEN STICKING WITH HARD COPIES
I AM IN YOUR BOAT I PREFER A HARD COPY HANDS DOWN I OWNED A KINDLE I COULDN'T GET INTO IT ACTUALLY READ LESS GOT RID OF THE KINDLE THE ONLY CONCRETE REASON I FOUND TO HAVE ONE IS THAT A LOT OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS RELEASE SHORT STORIES ONLY IN FORMAT IT'S FRUSTRATING AS HELL SO OCCASIONALLY I BREAK DOWN AND BUY THEM FOR MY IPAD AS A COMPROMISE
YOU CAN DOWNLOAD BOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG OR FROM AHEM OTHER SOURCES
I HAVE A NOOK THAT I SOMETIMES WILL READ ON BUT I MOSTLY READ HARD COPIES STILL SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO HAVE AN AND OTHER TIMES I THINK IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY
I LOVED HAVING IT FOR TRAVELING BUT I FIND THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY THE MOST FRAGILE ELECTRONIC ITEM I OWN I'M PRETTY CAREFUL WITH THEM AND DON'T ACTUALLY USE IT THAT OFTEN BUT I'M STILL ON MY THIRD ONE IN FOUR YEARS THEY AREN'T AS DURABLE AS PHONES AND IPODS AND LAPTOPS SO KEEP THAT IN MIND I DON'T FEEL LIKE I CAN JUST CHUCK MINE IN MY BAG AND CARRY IT EVERYWHERE LIKE I DO WITH AN OLD PAPERBACK
DO WE REALLY NEED A DESCRIPTION OF WHO ANNE FRANK IS IN THE TITLE WHO DOESN'T KNOW HER STORY BY NOW





DEAR

IF YOU DID NOT FINISH YOUR WORK PROPERLY

AND LOST PRECIOUS TIME

THEN ONCE AGAIN TAKE UP YOUR TASK

AND TRY HARDER THAN BEFORE

IF OTHERS HAVE REPROACHED YOU

FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WRONG

THEN BE SURE TO AMEND YOUR MISTAKE

THAT IS THE BEST ANSWER ONE CAN MAKE

IN MEMORY OF ANNE FRANK
IS SOMETHING GOING FOR ITS RESERVE PRICE UNUSUAL WHAT'S A MORE NORMAL RATIO

TITLE SEEMS TO THINK IT'S A BIG DEAL BUT I HAVE NO CONTEXT TO KNOW IF IT'S NOTABLE OR NOT
OHHHH THAT ANNE FRANK
TO BE HONEST I THOUGHT IT WOULD RETAIL FOR MORE
THE MAN WHO PURCHASED THE POEM A MR MANGUM WAS QUOTED AS SAYING ALTHOUGH SHE IS NOW A LITTLE BOY IN SPAIN MOST LIKELY PLAYING PIANOS FILLED WITH FLAMES I STILL HAD TO BID ON THIS POEM

HMM
BUT HOW MUCH IS THAT IN FREEDOM UNITS
JEFF BEEN SAVING UP FOR YEARS FOR THIS
AS AN ANTIQUARIAN BOOKSELLER THAT'S DAMN CHEAP
I HOPE IT WAS DONATED TO HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL OR A CHARITY SUCH AS THAT
I HATE TO BE THAT GUY BUT I FEEL LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BE DONATED TO A MUSEUM AUCTIONING IT OFF SEEMS KINDA WRONG
I'M READING HER DIARY I WISH I KNEW WHAT THIS POEM WAS ALSO I WISH HER SISTERS DIARY EXISTED STILL
AND THE WU TANG ALBUM SOLD FOR MILLION
DEAR

WHERE THE POEM
THANKS FOR THE DETAILED TITLED AS TO WHO ANNE FRANK WAS

DO PEOPLE SERIOUSLY NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS JUST BY NAME ANYMORE
HOW MUCH DOES THAT GUY LOOK LIKE THE DUDE FROM WILLY TONKA
IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM
I UNDERSTAND BUYING IT BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD SELL SUCH A THING ESPECIALLY KNOWING HER STORY
BAD TIME TO OVERPAY FOR MEMORABILIA OF MINORITIES PERSECUTED BY FASCISTS THAT GOING TO BE FLOODED SOON
IS IT ORIGINAL WRITTEN WITH FOUNTAIN PEN
I HEARD THERE WERE SOME FAKES WRITTEN WITH BALL PEN INVENTED AFTER HER DEATH
IT'S SAD BECAUSE IN HER DIARY SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO BE A WRITER WHEN THE WAR ENDED
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE POEM SAID
BUT WHY DOES THE GUY IN THE PICTURE LOOK LIKE HE IS BRIBING YOU FOR AN EVERLASTING GOBSTOPPER
RICK OF PAWN STARS WOULD HAVE SAID HOW HARD IT IS TO VALUE A ITEM LIKE THIS
IT'S A GOOD THING YOU EXPLAINED WHO ANNE FRANK WAS
I KEPT TRYING TO READ THE HANDWRITING UNTIL I REALIZED IT WAS IN DUTCH
IF THE MONEY COULD BRING HER BACK

I HOPE THIS ENDS UP IN A MUSEUM
LITTLE KNOWN FACT JEFF MANGUM IS A TIME TRAVELER SAVED ANNE FRANK HIS PARENTS RAISED HER AS THEIR DAUGHTER LATER ON SHE CHANGED HER NAME AND NOW THEY'RE MARRIED MOST PEOPLE THINK SHE DIED DURING WWII BUT THAT'S WHAT THE MSM WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE
USD FOR THOSE WONDERING
ARE WE SURE U SPAZ DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE BOOK BEFORE IT WAS SOLD
I WISH I WERE BETTER AT DECIPHERING THIS KIND OF HANDWRITING
AND A WAGNER BASEBALL CARD SOLD FOR ROUGHLY TEN TIMES THAT PRICE
I'M SURPRISED IT'S NOT SITTING IN THE AMSTERDAM MUSEUM
I WONDER HOW MUCH THE ORIGINAL DIARY WOULD BE WORTH PRICELESS
WAS THE POEM ANY GOOD AT LEAST
I'M MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT THE POEM SAYS
WHO KNEW ANNE FRANK WAS SUCH A PROLIFIC WRITER
TWO CURRENCIES AND NEITHER WAS USD
HAS TO DOUBLE CHECK THE CONVERSION RATE
NOBODY HAS NOTICED THAT SLUGWORTH IS HOLDING THE POEM
REMOVED
WHERE ARE THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS GOING
FIRST I READ TIMES ITS DESERVED PRICE I WAS LIKE WTF HOW CAN YOU ESTIMATE POETRY WITH THIS KIND OF PRECISION
BUT CAN IT PLAY FLASH
REMOVED
WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY SHOULDN'T THIS BE IN A WWII MUSEUM NOT IN SOME PRIVATE COLLECTORS HOUSE
I'M FRANKLY SURPRISED IT DIDN'T FETCH MORE FOR REAL THOUGH
HANDWRITTEN
SO SHE DIDN'T SAVE IT IN THE LATEST VERSION OF MICROSOFT OFFICE

ALSO THANKS FOR TELLING ME WHO ANNE FRANK WAS I HAD NO IDEA I THOUGHT SHE JUST GOT FAMOUS BECAUSE SHE WROTE A DIARY
IS THAT GUY IN THE BACKGROUND SLUGWORTH I GUESS HE FOUND OTHER SCAMS SINCE THE EVERLASTING GOBSTOPPER DIDNT WORK OUT
I WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE WORTH AT LEAST OVER A MILLION
R LATESTAGECAPITALISM
PRICE IN FREEDOM UNITS
BOUGHT BY AN AMERICAN HOPING IT HELD SECRET KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO HIDE FROM THE NAZIS WHICH THEY EXPECTED TO PUT TO GOOD NEWS
THIS IS A COMMON WAY TO LAUNDER MONEY
BUT HOW MANY COLLARINOS
HOW HAS THIS THREAD NOT GOTTEN ANTI SEMITIC AND RACIST YET
CTRL F SEARCH FOR GRAMMER NAZI

NOTHING REALLY

SEEMS REDDIN IS BEHAVING FOR ONCE
EW THE ENTIRE IDEA THAT PERSONAL WORK IS BEING SOLD LIKE THIS KINDA MAKES ME SICK I COULDN'T CARE IF SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED IT TO BE SOLD ETC ETC I FIND IT LAME
WASTE OF MONEY THERE'S GONNA BE A TON OF THESE KINDS OF DIARIES IN ABOUT YEARS
ANNE FRANK OWNER OF A TIME TRAVELING BALL POINT PEN
WRITTEN WITH A BALL POINT PEN FROM THE JUST AS THE DIARY
FRANK AND BEANNNSSS
HER DAD PROBABLY WROTE IT
THANKS FOR CLEARING UP WHO ANNE FRANK WAS

IF DEATH BROUGHT EVERY MAN FAME HE'D LEAP FROM THE CRADLE TO THE COFFIN
BUT STILL NOT NEARING THE COST IT TOOK TO PRODUCE IT
YOU SHOULDN'T NEED TO EXPLAIN WHO ANNE FRANK WAS
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS
WELL YOU SUCK
THATHAPPENED
ROSES ARE RED
VIOLETS ARE BLUE
THEY ARE COMING FOR ME
I'M DEAD

THEY FORGOT THE REALITY DYSFUNCTION BY PETER FOLIO HAMILTON
IT'S WORLD-BUILDING REDEFINED BIGLY
I ENJOYED THE LONG WAY TO A SMALL ANGRY PLANET IT WASN'T QUITE AS HARSH AND COLD AS A LOT OF SCIFI TENDS TO BE
ANATHEM
I READ BEHIND THE THRONE RECENTLY AND THOUGHT I'D GIVE MY TAKE ON IT FOR ANYONE CURIOUS

OVERALL I'D DEFINITELY I ENJOYED IT BUT IT DID STRIKE ME AS BEING VERY REMINISCENT OF YOUNG ADULT ROMANCES WHICH IS A GENRE I STILL ENJOY FROM TIME TO TIME IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT'S HOW IT'S MARKETED ANYWAYS I'M NOT SURE SINCE I FOUND AND READ IT THROUGH THE KINDLES THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE STORY IS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MAIN CHARACTER AND A FEW OF HER GUARDS BOTH ROMANTIC AND OTHERWISE WITH THE REST OF THE STORY SUCH AS HER INVESTIGATION OF THE MENTIONED PLOT SERVING MORE AS A BACKDROP

IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THE WORLD OF THE STORY ESPECIALLY BEYOND THE PALACE IS NOT VERY WELL BUILT UP OR DELVED INTO THERE WERE DEFINITELY SOME INTRIGUING ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIETY NAMELY THAT IT IS A MATRIARCHY BUT AGAIN THESE ELEMENTS DID NOT SERVE AS MUCH OF A FOCUS FOR THE BOOK AND WERE NOT REALLY DEVELOPED

AS FOR THE INTERSTELLAR PLOT I FOUND IT TO BE FAIRLY PEDESTRIAN AND UNINSPIRED WHILE IT DID SERVE AS THE IMPETUS FOR SOME GOOD MOMENTS THERE WERE NO REAL SURPRISES OR MYSTERIES THE PEOPLE BEHIND IT WERE BARELY BUILT UP AS CHARACTERS AND IN THE END IT WAS SOLVED TOO EASILY AND IN A MANNER WHICH WAS BADLY DONE IMO I'M STRUGGLING TO REALLY FIND THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT FOR FEAR OF SPOILERS BUT ESSENTIALLY IT MADE SOME ODD CHOICES MISTAKES FROM A STORYTELLING PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST IMO

SO AGAIN WHILE I DID ENJOY IT IT WAS MORE AS A ROMANCE AS OPPOSED TO A SCIFI NOVEL OR AS A TALE OF COURT INTRIGUE
ON A WHIM I PICKED UP BY KIM STANLEY ROBINSON I'D NEVER READ ANYTHING BY HIM BEFORE AND I'M ONLY PAGES IN BUT I'M SO STOKED I PICKED IT UP I LOVE FINDING A NEW AUTHOR THAT I CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT
SPACE PIRATES BLAH WHAT'S SOME GOOD NEW MIND EXPANDING SCI-FI SPIN CHILDREN OF TIME DRAGONS EGG ETC
MY OWN RECOMMENDATION FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IS THE GRIDLINKED SAGA BY NEAL ASHER ACTUALLY ALL HIS BOOKS ARE AWESOME
THANK YOU I AGREED WITH ALL THE CLASSIC PICKS SO I BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THE NEW ONES
I DON'T KNOW IF IN THE USA IS WELL KNOWN OR NOT THE EUROPEAN SCIENCE FICTION THEN I WOULD RECOMMEND MASTERWORKS JUST ONE OF THEM EUROPEAN THE FIRST ONE


REVELATION SPACE SAGA
AN ASTONISHING AND INCREDIBLY DEVELOPED TELLTALE ABOUT THE NEXT THOUSAND YEARS FOR THE HUMAN RACE
THERE ARE A LOT OF SHORT TALES ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF ALL OF THIS FUTURE BEGINNING WITH THE WAR OF MARS WHERE WERE CONFRONTED THE COMMON HUMANS AND THE POST HUMANS BETTER KNOWN AS CONJOINER A NOT SO NUMEROUS HIVE MIND HUMANS THAT INVENTED NEW METHODS OF SPACE TRAVELLING AND HABITAT BUILDING

FROM A TO Z THE RE SAGA IS SPECTACULAR AND WISELY DEVELOPED LETTING SOME ROOM FOR ART WRITING AND UNBELIEVABLE AND UNFORGETTABLE ENVIRONMENTS AND SCENES

I MIGHT SUGGEST HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY AN ABSOLUTE CLASSIC NOVEL WRITTEN BY THE BRILLIANT MIND DOUGLAS ADAMS IT'S HONESTLY PROBABLY MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME AND HOLDS ITS OWN AFTER ALL THIS TIME THE BOOKS FOLLOWING IT ARE PRETTY GREAT BUT AT THE VERY LEAST YOU MUST READ THE ORIGINAL IT'S WHAT GOT ME INTO READING
REVELATION SPACE BY ALISTAIR REYNOLDS IS GOOD SPACE OPERA THAT EXPANDS ONTO A TRILOGY BUT STILL STANDS GOOD ON ITS OWN
THANK YOU I COULD USE A BREAK
I REALIZE THAT THE ARTICLE'S GOAL IS TO SELL THINGS BUT WHAT ABOUT GOOD OLD CLASSICS

LORD OF LIGHT ROGER ZELAZNY

THE EINSTEIN INTERSECTION SAMUEL DELANY

GRANDMOTHERS BY ROYAL A LAFFERTY SHORT STORIES BUT DAMN

I'M GOING TO READ MY FIRST MOEBIUS BOOK WORLD OF ADENA THIS WEEKEND NOT A NOVEL PER SE BUT IT LOOKS AWESOME
MAN I WAS REALLY DIGGING LEVIATHAN WAKES DESPITE THE FACT THAT HOLDEN WAS RAPIDLY GETTING ON MY NERVES AND THEN THEY GOT TO EROS I PUT THE BOOK DOWN ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE MYSELF PICK IT BACK UP

I'M NOT SAYING THE BOOK WAS BAD I'M JUST SAYING I LOST INTEREST I WISH I COULD GET BACK INTO IT
I READ DARK RUN OVER THE SUMMER WHEN THE LOCAL LIBRARY PICKED UP A COPY AND DESPITE THE WELL DESIGNED COVER ART THE BOOK FELT INCREDIBLY DULL AND FORMULAIC IT FITS THE SPACE WESTERN TO A T AND IS UNDENIABLY WRITTEN AS THE SETUP TO A TRILOGY OF OTHER SPACE WESTERNS ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS THAT SAID THE AUTHOR DID DO A VERY GOOD JOB DESCRIBING THE SCENES AND FICTIONAL OBJECTS SO THE BOOK NEVER BECOMES BORING BUT IT CAN BE A LEISURELY AND SHORT READ
DARK MATTER WAS PRETTY DAMN COOL BLEW THROUGH IT IN DAYS BUT WAS FUN AS HELL SOME QUANTUM LEAP LIKE FEEL TO IT WITH DIMENSIONAL AWESOMENESS

DARK MATTER
ESCAPE INTO
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO SIGOURNEY WEAVER
STEPHEN R THE GAP CYCLE IS BRILLIANT DARK MATURE AND SOLID SCI FI
THE SHOULD ADD THE FOUNDATION SERIES AND YOU WONT HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR FAMILY TILL EASTER
THIS IS A BIZARRE LIST MOSTLY RECENT STUFF BUT THEN DOWNBELOW STATION THROWN IN WHICH WAS WHAT

AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT LIST ISN'T IT'S THE BEST SF OF THE LAST YEARS
I AM CURRENTLY ENJOYING HG WELLS THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON IT IS LIGHT READING AND PURE FUN
I'M ADDING ALL OF THESE TO MY CHRISTMAS LIST
NICE LIST
I'D LIKE TO READ SOME MORE SF PREFERABLY SOME CLASSIC ICONIC STUFF I'VE READ FOUNDATION BUT WASN'T ENTHRALLED ENOUGH TO FINISH THE TRILOGY ALSO READ AND BRAVE NEW WORLD WHICH I BOTH LOVED ALSO READ A COUPLE OF SHORT STORIES LIKE I HAVE NO MOUTH WOULD LOVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS
WISH I COULD BUT I JUST CAN'T READ TWO BOOKS AT THE SAME TIME AND I'VE BEEN SLOGGING THROUGH TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD FOR LIKE MONTHS ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ
I'VE WANTED TO GET INTO SCI-FI FOR A LONG TIME BUT I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO START I'VE OBVIOUSLY HEARD OF ISAAC ASIMOV BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THESE CLASSICS ARE A GOOD START

I LIKE SCIENCE EXPLORATION AND PHILOSOPHY MORE THAN WAR AND POLITICS REALLY ALTHOUGH I'VE ACTUALLY READ AND REALLY ENJOYED

HOW IS I ROBOT IS IT PART OF A SERIES I GET A LITTLE LOST IN ASIMOV
QUEEN LE QUEI AND THE WOODEN PEG
HERE ARE SOME OF MY PERSONAL GRIPES


WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED WITH STORYLINE I LOVED THE INITIAL PARTS OF IT OF HIM CHASING DOWN DIOGENES THE SUSPENSE AND MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE KIDNAPPING OF CONSTANCE EX COFFIN WAS GREAT BUT THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN WE'RE LEFT WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHEN HE'S LEFT IN A DESERT OF LIONS AT THE END OF THE BOOK HE JUST POPS BACK UP IN THE MANSION WHAT HAPPENED IN-BETWEEN AND IF THIS IS HOW IT TURNED OUT WHY THE HELL DID THEY JUST LEAVE PROCTOR OUT THERE IT LEFT A VERY SOUR TASTE IN MY MOUTH BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE THE AUTHORS THOUGHT TO THEMSELVES HM THIS PLOT WON'T WORK WITH PROCTOR IN IT LET'S JUST HAVE HIM GO ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE AND HAVE HIM STRANDED OUT THERE TO MAKE IT MORE PLAUSIBLE


2 WHY DID PENDERGAST AND THE FBI AGENT I FORGOT HIS NAME SPARE DIOGENES LIFE FOR PENDERGAST HE HAS A MORAL CODE HE KNOWS WHAT DIOGENES HAS DONE TO OTHERS AND TO HIS FAMILY HE DEVISED A PLOT TO BREAK APART THE MANSION WHILE PENDERGAST WAS GONE AND MURDERED TWO INNOCENT PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL BUT BECAUSE OF MPH FAMILY THEME HE SUDDENLY DECIDES TO LET HIM GO IN THE LAST MINUTE REALLY


AND WHAT ABOUT THE FBI AGENT HE SAW HIS PARTNERS DIE BY THIS MAN HAS HIS OWN MEN KILLED IN ATTEMPTING TO CAPTURE DIOGENES AND ALL BECAUSE OF WHAT PENDERGAST SAYS HE SAVES HIM TOO WHAT THE FUCK


WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THAT OBSIDIAN CHAMBER IT JUST SEEMS EXTREMELY RANDOM SERIOUSLY WHO HAS A WHOLE BUILDING DEDICATED TO HAVING THESE RANDOM ALBEIT SIGNIFICANT EVENTS FRAMED LIKE THAT ALL AROUND AND TO BLOW IT UP OH AND THAT ATTEMPT TO BLOW IT UP ALSO CONVENIENTLY HARMS THE ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE DIOGENES AGAIN ANOTHER LAST MINUTE EFFORT IT SEEMS BY THE AUTHORS TO DISPLAY DIOGENES AS A DAMAGED INDIVIDUAL WHO CAN BE REDEEMED AND 2 HAVE A NICE PART OF THE PLOT TO CAUSE SOME CHAOS AND EXPLOSIONS


CONSTANCE AND DIOGENES GOOD GOD THIS CONSTITUTED THE MAJORITY OF THE BOOK AND THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS SO DULL IT WAS EXTREMELY OBVIOUS THAT CONSTANCE WAS PLAYING DIOGENES AND ON TOP OF THAT HER PERSONALITY WAS ALWAYS BORING DIOGENES OUT OF CHARACTER WAS COMPLYING WITH CONSTANCE HAVING SEEN THIS CHARACTER DO WORK IN THE OTHER BOOKS THIS PORTRAYAL WAS SUCH A DRAB IT WAS LIKE THE NOTEBOOK BUT WITH IT BEING OBVIOUS OF HOW MUCH RYAN GOSLING AND RACHEL MCADAMS HATE EACH OTHER


OH ANOTHER CONVENIENT PLOT MOVE TO HAVE BOTH CONSTANCE AND DIOGENES GO AWAY YEAH






THIS MAKES ME WANT TO READ HP HOVERCRAFT
I BET HE JUST WALKS IN A ROOM FILLED WITH INFINITE MONKEYS ON INFINITE TYPEWRITERS SPOUTS A FEW SENTENCES AND THEN LEAVES CONTENT WITH A WEEKS WORK
EACH CHAPTER'S LIKE OR 2 PAGES LONG FOR ALL HIS BOOKS I BET HE WRITES A FEW SENTENCES FOR EACH BOOK EVERY DAY AND SOMEONE ELSE FLESHES THEM OUT
PATTERSON WRITES ALONG WITH SEVERAL HE SAYS HE IS SIMPLY MORE PROFICIENT AT DREAMING UP PLOTS THAN CRAFTING SENTENCE AFTER SENTENCE

WIKI
THE ALEX CROSS SERIES IS STILL CREDITED TO JUST PATTERSON BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING ELSE IS PATTERSON WRITES AN OUTLINE OF ABOUT PAGES SOME HAVE SAID IT WAS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THEN HE HANDS IT OFF TO THE OTHER AUTHOR OTHER GUY FILLS IN THE DETAILS AND PATTERSON ASKS FOR DRAFTS EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS TO GIVE NOTES
I GOT MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN CREATIVE WRITING AND IN A COUPLE OF CLASSES WE DISCUSSED THE JAMES PATTERSON TECHNIQUE WHAT I REMEMBER BEING TOLD IS THAT HE HAS A WHOLE LOT OF COAUTHORS SOME OF WHOM DON'T EVEN GET CREDITED FOR ON THE COVER SOME OF HIS COAUTHORS ARE GHOST WRITERS PATTERSON WRITES UP A DETAILED OUTLINE OF EACH BOOK WITH DETAILS FOR WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN WHICH ORDER THEN DELIVERS THE OUTLINE TO HIS CHOSEN COAUTHOR AND THEY DO ALL OF THE WRITING AND SEND IT BACK TO HIM FOR REVIEW BEFORE SENDING IT OUT FOR PUBLICATION OTHER AUTHORS USE THIS METHOD TOO TOM CLANCY DID BUT PATTERSON IS PROBABLY THE MOST PROLIFIC BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAS A NEW BOOK OUT
2 BOOKS A MONTH REALLY WOW THAT SORT OF BLOWS MY MIND
AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS AT A BOOKSTORE I FEEL THE NEED TO COMMENT ON HOW MUCH I DESPISE JAMES PATTERSON THE AMOUNT OF BOOKS THAT HE WRITES IS ABSURD HIS BOOKS ARE IN AT LEAST SECTIONS IN MY STORE AND WE RECEIVE OF EVERY NEW BOOK HE COMES OUT WITH SOLEY BECAUSE IT HAS HIS NAME ON IT HONESTLY HIS BOOKS COULD BE DECENT AND I WOULD STILL HATE HIM JUST BASED ON HOW LONG IT TAKES ME TO TRY AND SQUEEZE ALL OF HIS BOOKS INTO HIS SECTION
METAMORPHOSIS BY KAFKA UNSURPASSED
THE STRANGER ALBERT CAMUS

GOOD MORNING MIDNIGHT BY JEAN RHYS
A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES
NO LONGER HUMAN BY OSAMU DALAI TRULY ONE OF THE MOST EXISTENTIALLY SUFFOCATING NOVELS EVER WRITTEN

THE CATCHER IN THE RYE
SO MUCH TO TELL YOU BY AUSTRALIAN AUTHOR JOHN MARSDEN WRITTEN IN JOURNAL FORMAT MY FAVOURITE BOOK OF ALL TIME
FOR OTHER JAPANESE WRITERS

RYUNOSUKE SPINNING GEARS

NATSUME GRASS BY THE WAYSIDE

THE LATTER ESPECIALLY WAS A BRUTAL READ FOR ME ABOUT THE FAILURE AND FUTILITY OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS
MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY IF I EVER FINISH IT
SLAUGHTERHOUSE BY KURT VONNEGUT
WOULD SECOND CRIME AND PUNISHMENT AND THE METAMORPHOSIS AND ALSO THROW IN THE TRIAL BY KAFKA
DESERT SOLITAIRE BY EDWARD ABBEY
KOKOMO BY SOSEKI NATSUME
THE WAY OF KINGS ONE OF THE CHARACTERS PALADIN HIS BUDDIES MANAGED TO ALMOST ACCURATELY PORTRAYED DEPRESSION THE LOSING WILL TO LIVE AND THE FEAR OF FAILURE AGAIN LEADING TO NOT DOING ANYTHING

ONE OF THE CHARACTERS IN MALAYAN THE HISTORIAN ON BOOK 2 ALSO SHOWCASED THAT
KOBO ABE THE BOX MAN
METERMAN
CHUCK BOOKS OFTEN CONTAIN ELEMENTS OF THIS THEME CHOKE LULLABY FIGHT CLUB AND INVISIBLE MONSTERS ALL DO IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS
WOLF IN WHITE VAN BY JOHN ARNELLE
THE ONLY TERM I CAN THINK OF TO DESCRIBE THAT WOULD BE A PRODIGAL SON TYPE STORYLINE REFERRING TO THE BIBLICAL PARABLE BUT IN GENERAL GENRE CATEGORIES DON'T DRILL DOWN QUITE THAT SPECIFIC YOU COULD CERTAINLY POST ON R SUGGESTMEABOOK ASKING FOR BOOKS THAT MEET THAT CRITERIA THOUGH THERE ARE BOUND TO BE A LOT OUT THERE THAT ARE SIMILAR
SNOW CRASH NEAL STEPHENSON THE BOOK STARTS OFF WITH THE MAIN CHARACTER HAVING HIT BOTTOM AS A PIZZA DELIBERATOR THEN PICKS UP FROM THERE
THAT HAPPENS IN MY OWN COUNTRY A MEMOIR BY ABRAHAM VERGHESE HE WAS THEIR DOCTOR THESE MEN RETURNED HOME TO DIE

IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT BUT JUST IN CASE
I CAN THINK OF ONE LIKE THIS BUT IT'S NOT A STORY PROVINCES OF NIGHT WILLIAM GAY
SOME EXAMPLES THAT I CAN THINK OF OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

GIVE US A KISS BY DANIEL WOODRELL IS A REALLY DARK BUT FANTASTIC TYPE OF STORY LIKE THIS
COASTLINES BY JOANNE HARRIS IS ALSO REALLY GOOD
THE DRESSMAKER BY ROSALIE HAM
THE SHIPPING NEWS BY ANNIE PROULX WELL ALMOST BUT SIMILAR VIBE
ROOM BY EMMA DONOGHUE VERY TRAUMATIC EVENT
MAYBE LOOK AT THREE DAY ROAD BY JOSEPH BOYDEN
IF YOU'RE NOT USED TO WRITING STYLE THE MAJORITY OF THE BOOK CAN BE IMPOSING AND IN GENERAL CONFUSING AND BROKEN ENGLISH

FOR GETTING USED TO HIS STYLE OF WRITING I'D RECOMMEND A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN AND HIS DUBLINERS BOTH WILL GET YOU USED TO HIS STYLE WHILE BEING EASIER TO READ NOT TO MENTION DUBLINERS IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE BEST SHORT STORY COLLECTIONS

AS FOR THE CONTENT OF THE BOOK ITSELF IF YOU HAVEN'T READ ODYSSEY YET I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING IT FIRST A LOT OF ULYSSES IS BASED ON CHAPTERS OF THE ODYSSEY IN FACT A LOT IS MAKING FUN OF SITUATIONS OF THE ODYSSEY BUT IN A DAY IN DUBLIN AND IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE REFERENCES IT CAN MAKE THE NOVEL A LOT MORE ENJOYABLE

TO SUMMARIZE I'D READ THE ODYSSEY AND AT LEAST ONE OF EASIER NOVELS MINIMUM TO GET A GOOD READING EXPERIENCE OUT OF ULYSSES YOU COULD ALWAYS READ IT WITH A READING COMPANION BOOK TO HELP OUT BUT AS YOU SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT

HOPE THIS HELPS


YOU CAN SKIP GUIDE BOOKS BUT IT DOES HELP TO KNOW HOW EACH CHAPTER PERTAINS TO THE DIFFERENT ODYSSEAN ADVENTURES

AND YES YOU WON'T GET ALL OF IT I PROBABLY ONLY GOT OF IT AND STILL FOUND IT VERY REWARDING
YEAH JUST GO FOR IT

BE PREPARED TO GIVE UP ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH AS A CASUAL READ IT IS DENSE AND THE LANGUAGE CAN BE OFF PUTTING I QUIT READING IT ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT WITH A GUN TO MY HEAD IN UNIVERSITY I GOT OVER THE HUMP AND REALLY ENJOYED IT
YOU GO NOTHING CAN PREPARE YOU FOR IT
AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION SHOULD I READ THE ODEASY FIRST
GO FOR IT THERE'S ALSO A GREAT AUDIOBOOK VERSION ON YOUTUBE THIS IS A BOOK I FOUND VERY HELPFUL TO HEAR ALOUD AS WELL AS READING IT AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A GUIDE BOOK THERE IS ALWAYS SUMMARIES ONLINE IF YOU GET STUCK ON A PARTICULARLY HARD PART
THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE A WEIRD RECOMMENDATION BUT TRY FOLLOWING ALONG WITH AN AUDIO VERSION FOR A BIT THERE IS A WONDERFUL FREE RECORDING ON ARCHIVE

JOYCE LIKE SO MANY MODERNISTS MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU HEAR HIM OUT LOUD ULYSSES IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS
I GAVE UP TWICE BOTH TIMES AROUND ONE-THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH MUCH LATER I TRIED AGAIN USING AN AUDIOBOOK TO HELP ME I GOT TO THE END AND I'M REALLY GLAD I PERSISTED WITH IT I WILL READ IT AGAIN ONE DAY
I TRIED TO READ IT AND AFTER EVERY CHAPTER FELT LIKE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I HAD JUST READ ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH I DISCOVERED THAT THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE HAS A SHORT BREAKDOWN OF EVERY CHAPTER SO I STARTED READING THAT BEFORE I READ THE CHAPTER IT TAKES AWAY A LOT OF THE SURPRISE BUT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET A GRASP ON WHAT JOYCE WAS COMMUNICATING
WHAT WORKED FOR ME IS READING THE BOOK ALONGSIDE READING CHAPTERS IN JAMES ULYSSES CRITICAL ESSAYS EDITED BY CLIVE HART AND DAVID HAYMAN THERE IS AN ESSAY FROM DIFFERENT CRITICS ON EACH CHAPTER SO I'D READ AN ESSAY AND THEN THE CORRESPONDING CHAPTER IN ULYSSES THIS MAY GIVE THINGS AWAY SPOILERS BUT I FOUND THAT ULYSSES IS SO MULTILAYERED IT REALLY HELPED TO KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHILE READING GOOD LUCK IT'S TOTALLY WORTH THE EFFORT
THE ONLY WAY I SURVIVED A GREEK TRAGEDY COURSE SS TO READ THE CLIFF NOTES BEFORE DIVING IN
I'D SAY GO FOR IT IT WOULDN'T HURT TO READ A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN FIRST THOUGH SINCE STEPHEN DAEDALUS WHO'S IN ULYSSES IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THAT BOOK
YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO FOLLOW FRANK PODCAST RE JOYCE WHICH GOES THROUGH ULYSSES LINE BY LINE AND TALKS ABOUT ALL THE REFERENCES AND STUFF ITS GREAT FUN
I'VE READ EXACTLY ONE BOOK RELEASED IN AND IT'S NOT A FINALIST SO I WOULDN'T VOTE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF BEST BOOKS AWARD LET'S SAY IN A GIVEN CATEGORY I HAVE READ BOOKS OUT OF SINCE I HAVEN'T READ OF THEM HOW CAN I SAY THAT ANY OF THOSE BOOKS IN THAT GIVEN CATEGORY IS THE BEST ONE NATURALLY I MAY CHOOSE THE BEST ONE OUT OF THE THAT I'VE READ BUT IF A REALLY GOOD BOOK IS AMONG THE BOOKS THAT I HAVEN'T READ THEN I'VE FAILED IN CHOOSING THE BEST BOOK

UNLESS ALL OF THE VOTERS HAVE READ ALL OF THE BOOKS ISN'T THIS ONLY POPULARITY AND NOT BEST BOOK CONTEST
I VOTED FOR EVICTED POVERTY AND PROFIT IN THE AMERICAN CITY BY MATTHEW DESMOND FOR NONFICTION AND WHEN BREATH BECOMES AIR BY PAUL KALANITHI FOR AUTOBIOGRAPHY I HADN'T REALLY READ MOST OF THE NOMINEES FOR THE OTHER CATEGORIES A LOT ARE STILL ON MY LIST
NORM MACDONALD BOOK FOR HUMOR STEPHEN KING FOR MYSTERY AND THE NIX FOR FICTION
THE FINALISTS ARE ALL SHIT
MY GIRLFRIEND IS READING LILY AND THE OCTOPUS AND AS TWO DOG LOVERS THE FEW PAGES THAT I'VE READ OF IT WHEN I'VE HAD SPARE TIME AND TOO MUCH CURIOSITY HAVE BEEN REALLY TENDER EMOTIONAL AND WELL-WRITTEN I'VE NOT READ TOO MUCH BUT MY GIRLFRIEND SEEMS TO THINK IT'S A LOVELY BOOK SORT OF SURPRISED TO SEE IT IN THE FINALISTS THOUGH

I'M ONLY ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH IT NOW BUT I'M SUFFICIENTLY IMPRESSED THE OUTRUN BY AMY LIPTROT THAT I'D HAPPILY ENDORSE IT FOR MY FAVOURITE BOOK OF UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT THERE
I RARELY VOTE BECAUSE I NEVER LIKE THE FINALISTS SOMEHOW THE BOOKS NOMINATED IN VARIOUS CATEGORIES TEND TO BE BOOKS I FOUND TO BE STARTLINGLY WEAK
I LOVE URBAN FANTASY AND TEND TO VOTE FOR THE NEW KATE DANIELS BOOK ILONA ANDREWS IS ONE OF THE BEST WRITERS IN THE GENRE I USUALLY VOTE IN THE F FANTASY SCI-FI CATEGORIES
I WON'T SAY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS BUT IT IS MY OPINION ON THIS

DEPENDING ON THE TITLES YOU READ IT CAN BE AN EXERCISE OF WILLIAM THE FACT THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO READ THE BOOK AND UNDERSTAND IT CHANGES THE IMPORTANCE YOUR PSYCHE GIVES TO THE ACT OF READING AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTENTION YOU SPEND MORE ENERGY ON IT YOUR BRAIN REMEMBERS WORDS PHRASES ACTIONS PATTERNS MOTIVES AND SUCH THE ACT OF CONSCIOUSLY MAKING CONNECTIONS ALSO HELPS YOU RECOGNIZE THE SITUATIONS IN WHICH YOU ENCOUNTER THE PREVIOUSLY STATED EXAMPLES

OF COURSE THIS IS SPECIFIC IT'S ALSO THE FACT THAT READING IS AN ACT OF WILL MOST OF THE TIME WATCHING A MOVIE CAN BE BRAINLESS IT CAN BE A BACKGROUND ACTION WHICH ISN'T OF IMPORTANCE TO YOUR BRAIN

CONSCIOUS ACTIVITY NO MATTER THE FORM IT TAKES LEADS TO AN IMPROVEMENT OF KINDS IT'S NOT IMMEDIATE BUT IT IS REAL


ALSO THIS IS MY PERSPECTIVE MOST MOVIES DON'T DELVE INTO THE THOUGHTS OF THE CHARACTERS READING THAT SAID CHARACTER WANTS TO POUR WATER CAN MAKE YOU THINK MORE INTO THE SITUATION TO WHAT END DOES HE STOP THE DIALOGUE TO GIVE HIM MORE TIME TO THINK ON THE SITUATION TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE OPPOSING PARTY IN THE DIALOGUE

MY POINT IS IT MIGHT MAKE YOUR GENERAL THOUGHT PROCESS TO BE MORE INSIGHTFUL
WELL FOR A BOOK MOVIE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF IMPACT IN YOUR LIFE IT HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU READ ENJOYED AND MOVED ON MAYBE READING A BOOK OR WATCHING A MOVIE RELATING TO WHAT YOUR GOING THROUGH YOUR FEARS THOUGHTS EVENTS IN YOUR OWN LIFE MIGHT HELP IF YOU READ A BOOK ON UNDERSTANDING HUMAN BEHAVIORS BECAUSE YOUR SON DAUGHTER IS ACTING A LITTLE DIFFERENT MIGHT HELP IMPACT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER IF YOUR GOING THROUGH A DEPRESSION PHASE IT MIGHT NOT HELP TO READ A BOOK ON TECHNOLOGY IT ALL COMES DOWN TO YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES
LET ME SHARE HOW READING CHANGED MY ENTIRE WORLD-VIEW I USED TO BE A RELIGIOUS PERSON READING MADE ME REALIZE ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH MY FORMER RELIGION AND A RELIGIOUS WORLD-VIEW TO BEGIN WITH AFTER LETTING GO OF RELIGION I HAD TO CHANGE MY WORLD-VIEW AND READING BOOKS SUCH AS CARL COSMOS THE GOD DELUSION BY RICHARD DAWKINS AMONG MANY OTHERS HELPED RESHAPE MY WORLD-VIEW FROM A RELIGIOUS ONE TO A SCIENCE BASED ONE

SO YEAH READING QUITE LITERALLY WAS MY GATEWAY TO FREEDOM OF MIND
THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY THAT A MOVIE CAN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOU THEY JUST HAVE LESS TIME TO DO IT
WHAT BOOKS DO YOU USUALLY READ WHAT BOOKS HAVE YOU READ RECENTLY

IT COULD BE A MATTER OF CIRCUMSTANCE THAT YOU HAVEN'T YET READ ANYTHING THAT PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED YOU
I USED TO GET MORE OUT OF MOVIES THAN NOVELS THEN I DISCOVERED KAFKA CONRAD AND JANE AUSTEN IN THAT ORDER AS IT HAPPENS SINCE THEN NOVELS TEND TO GET TO ME MORE THAN MOVIES
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS BUT I START THINKING OF SMALL MOMENTS IN MY LIFE IN A LITERARY SENSE SOMETIMES IN MY THOUGHTS I DESCRIBE THE MOMENT IN WORDS IN THIRD PERSON JUST HAPPENS I LOVE THOSE HAPPY LITTLE MOMENTS PLUS YOUR VOCABULARY GROWS THE IDEAS PLOTS CHARACTER TYPES AFTER READING BOOKS YOU HAVE MORE OF A SENSE OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE LIKE AND DIFFERENT SITUATIONS I LOVE IT
YOU DON'T REMEMBER THEM AFTER MONTHS I HAVE A BUNCH OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS IN MY ROOM ON SHELVES AND I CAN REMEMBER THE PLOT POINTS AND MAIN DETAILS IN BASICALLY OF THEM

I BECAUSE I FORGET MOST OF THE DETAILS BUT I AM SURPRISED TO SEE YOU FEEL THAT WAY I THINK YOU MAY RETAIN MORE FACTORIES AND USELESS KNOWLEDGE THAN YOU ARE EVEN AWARE OF TSH OR AT LEAST I DO
READING MORE GIVES YOU AN INCREASED VOCABULARY AND MAKES YOU A BETTER WRITER I PERSONALLY THINK IT ENHANCES YOUR DEPTH OF CHARACTER AS WELL
READING HAS CHANGED ME FROM AN PERSON TO A LIFELONG LEARNER EVERY BOOK IS AN ESCAPE A BROADENING OF MY HORIZONS IT ADDS TO MY KNOWLEDGE BASE OF BOTH USEFUL FACTS AND CONCEPTS AS WELL AS GIVING ME ENTERTAINMENT AND HOBBIES
THIS ISN'T AS THOUGHT-PROVOKING AS SOME OF THE OTHER ANSWERS BUT IT HELPED ME REIN IN MY SPENDING AND STOP DRINKING AS MUCH I WENT FOR A YEAR WITHOUT READING MUCH IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING GRAD SCHOOL I JUST HAD NO INTEREST IN READING AND FOUND MYSELF VERY BORED SO I WENT OUT A LOT I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY TIME

NOW THAT I'VE GOTTEN BACK TO READING I'M TOTALLY HAPPY TO COME HOME AFTER WORK PUT ON MY SLIPPERS AND SPEND THE EVENING WITH A BOOK
BECAUSE A PERSON READING A BOOK INSTANTLY BECOMES MORE ATTRACTIVE AND A PERSON WATCHING A MOVIE DOES NOT
WELL I WILL EXPAND ON MY OPINION HERE SO GOOD BOOKS THEY GIVE ME A HIGH FOR 2 DAYS LIKE I AM ON LIQUOR BUT THEN I READ SOMETHING ELSE AND I AM ON A NEW HIGH ITS THE SAME WITH TV SERIES MOVIES ARE TOO SHORT FOR ANY CHARACTER TO GROW ON ME BUT I ROOT FOR THE STORY THE CHARACTERS PHILOSOPHY OR LIFE CHANGING ATTITUDE IS NOT SOMETHING I RELATE WITH MY OWN EXPERIENCE
TRULY A WONDERFUL MIND AND A WONDERFUL HEART TO GUIDE IT BOOKS ARE AN ALL-TIME FAVOURITE OF MY SON'S AND INDEED WERE THE ONLY BOOKS HE SEEMED INTERESTED IN READING I MYSELF PREFER THE CLASSICS OR THE OCCASIONAL SUMMER THRILLER ON THE BEACH AND AT FIRST I WAS APPREHENSIVE AT THE PROSPECT OF MY TEENAGER READING WHAT I CONSIDERED TO BE CHILDREN'S BOOKS

FATHER LEFT WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT BETWEEN US AND I FEEL LIKE HE OFTEN RETREATED INTO HIMSELF IN ORDER TO COPE SPENDING MANY HOURS WITH A BOOK IN HAND OR LESS COMMONLY HIS GAMDEBOO I GUESS I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE HE WAS SPENDING HIS TIME WISELY I WAS WORRIED THAT THOUGH HE WAS CERTAINLY READING A LOT WHICH WAS PREFERABLY TO SPENDING TIME IN FRONT OF A SCREEN HE WASN'T APPLYING HIMSELF OR CULTIVATING HIS MIND I FELT LIKE THERE WAS NO END TO THE PRITCHETT BOOKS THERE ARE SO MANY AND I WAS TOLD BY FRIENDS THAT MANY SUCH FANTASY SERIES WERE COMPARABLE TO CARTOONS OR COMIC BOOKS IN TERMS OF WRITING

I TRIED TO GET HIM TO READ SUCH WORKS AS I HAD ENJOYED WHEN I WAS YOUNGER EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO BUY HIM A COMPLETE SET OF THE WORDSWORTH CLASSICS ADVENTURE TITLES FOR HIS BIRTHDAY BUT HE'D SPEND EVERY QUID OF HIS ALLOWANCE ON THOSE DISCWORLD NOVELS AT LAST I CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT AND WAS SURPRISED BY HOW VERBOSE HE WAS WHEN HE SPOKE IN DEFENCE HE CONVINCED ME TO GIVE THE NOVELS A TRY AND I ENDED UP ENJOYING THEM THOUGH I SUSPECT I'M NOT EXACTLY THE TARGET AUDIENCE

NOW I NO LONGER DISTRUST MY SON'S JUDGEMENT AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT HE SEEMS TO NOT ONLY GROW ON THE INSIDE FROM READING ABOUT THESE WONDERFUL CHARACTERS AND WORLDS BUT THAT HE'S ALSO COMING OUT OF HIS SHELL AND REALLY GETTING A WIDER GRASP OF THE WORLD THE PAST YEARS OR SO HAVE BEEN HARD WITH THE SEPARATION AND ISSUES OF ALIMONY INDEED PERCY WAS MUCH WOUNDED BY HIS FATHER'S DECISION TO MOVE OUT TO THE COUNTRY THEY NEVER SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE AND I'M SURE IT'S BEEN A BLOW TO CONFIDENCE

AS FOR MYSELF IT'S BEEN A CHAOTIC TIME WHERE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO RESOLVE AROUND MY I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT I WAS THERE FOR PERCY IN ANY WAY I COULD BUT EVEN SO IT'S BEEN A QUESTION OF HEALING FOR MYSELF AS WELL I REGRET THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND A SUITABLE MAN AFTER THE DIVORCE AS I THINK PERCY WOULD HAVE BENEFITED FROM A BETTER FATHER FIGURE MORE RESPECTABLE THAN MY EX WHICH WOULDN'T BE HARD TO FIND NOW THAT I'M OLDER I FIND IT MUCH HARDER TO ATTRACT MEN INDEED PERCY IS ON THE CUSP OF ADULTHOOD AND AS SUCH I CONFESS THAT IT IS MAINLY OUT OF MY OWN DESIRE THAT I WISH TO FIND MYSELF SOMEONE NEW PERHAPS IT IS TOO SELF-INDULGENT OR EVEN TOO OPTIMISTIC TO THINK THAT I MIGHT FIND MARITAL HAPPINESS AT THIS TENDER AGE OF BUT JUST LIKE IN LOVELY NOVELS THE IMPOSSIBLE CAN ALWAYS HAPPEN
TELLING THE TELEVISION INTERVIEWER KATIE COURIC IN THAT I'VE GOT PLENTY OF MONEY MORE MONEY THAN I EVER DREAMED I WOULD HAVE BUT I AM NOT A BILLIONAIRE SHE HAS REMAINED PUBLICLY SILENT ON THE SUBJECT SINCE

SO I SET OUT THIS WEEK TO ASSESS THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF HER FORTUNE NOT TO INVADE HER PRIVACY BUT BECAUSE SHE'S THAT COMMODITY IN THE RANKS OF THE ULTRAWEALTHY A ROLE MODEL

I'M NOT SURE THAT MAKES ANY SENSE SURE SEEMS LIKE HE IS INVADING HER PRIVACY AND BECAUSE HE THINKS SHE'S A ROLE MODEL
IN MY S I DIGESTED EVERY WORD I COULD FIND OF VONNEGUT FITZGERALD SALINGER FLANNERY O'CONNOR CERVANTES DANTE KAFKA MARSHALL MCLUHAN AND CHOMSKY AND LOTS OF OTHERS BEAT WORKING

BUT REALLY IT WAS HESSE ALL AND ALWAYS DAMIEN SIDDHARTHA JOURNEY TO THE EAST STEPPENWOLF AND DAS GLASPERLENSPIEL AND ESPECIALLY INCULP I TALK ABOUT INCULP ON THIS AND OTHER SUBS WHENEVER I CAN I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE ELSE WHO READ IT BUT IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED EVERYTHING FOR ME MY PRIORITIES AND PERSON I EVEN ENDED UP LIVING IN BAVARIA AND SPENT YEARS OVERSEAS WANDERING AND BACKPACKING AND ROOTLESS STILL IT RESONATES PERSONALLY AND ON A LEVEL I HAVE GIVEN UP TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I WISH HESSE WERE MORE WIDELY TRANSLATED AND READ IN AMERICA
YOU'VE GOT TO READ MOBY DICK NO OTHER BOOK I'VE EVER READ IS AS POETIC PHILOSOPHICAL AND BIBLICALLY EPIC AS THE TALE OF THE WHITE WHALE THERE'S A REASON WHY IT IS SO UBIQUITOUS IN AMERICAN CULTURE IT REALLY IS THAT GOOD
THE DEMON HAUNTED WORLD SCIENCE AS A CANDLE IN THE DARK

BILLIONS AND BILLIONS

FIGHT CLUB
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH STEINBECK

GRAPES OF WRATH OR EAST OF EDEN ARE MUST READS IN MY OPINION

A NOTABLY SHORTER BOOK THAT HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON MY LIFE WAS ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT
FICTION

AMERICAN PASTORAL

MAO II

CHILDREN

NONFICTION

ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALITY

THE OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS ENEMIES
GONE WITH THE WIND

THE FEMALE OF THE SPECIES

THE THINGS THEY CARRIED

CODE NAME VERITY

TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD

GONE WITH THE WIND IS A GOOD CHOICE OF BOOK TO READ IMO IT'S A CLASSIC BUT NOT AS MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO READ IT THESE DAYS IT TOOK THE WORLD BY A STORM WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND I CAN SEE WHY I FINISHED THE BOOK IN A FEW DAYS AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU YOURSELF HAVE SURVIVED THROUGH THE CIVIL WAR AFTER YOU FINISH IT

TROPIC OF CAPRICORN BY HENRY MILLER
A PRAYER FOR OWEN IRVING
PROBABLY THE SHOCK DOCTRINE BY NAOMI KLEIN

I WAS LIBERTARIAN VERGING ON APOLITICAL BEFORE I ENCOUNTERED HER WORK IT WAS A REAL WAKE UP CALL ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMIC POLICY
READ THAT IN MY MID TWENTIES HIT PRETTY HARD
MY TWENTIES WERE SHAPED BY BLUE AND BROWN BOOKS THE SELFISH GENE AND THE GRAPES OF WRATH

GRAPES SHAPED MY VIEW OF COMMUNITY AND WHAT LIFE MEANS AS A VERB DAWKINS WAS MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO EVOLUTION YOU COULD EXCHANGE GOULD OR ANY OTHER COMPETENT BIOLOGIST DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IT GAVE ME A SENSE OF HISTORY AND PLACE AND MADE ME THINK ABOUT SOCIAL CONTEXT IN TERMS OF COMPETITION AND GOALS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WE'RE PURSUING FINALLY WITTGENSTEIN MADE ME THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND TRUTH HE GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE TO COME OUT AND SAY THAT SOME QUESTIONS AREN'T DIFFICULT THEY'RE JUST VERY POORLY CONSTRUCTED
MAYBE A BIT CLICH BUT FOR MY EARLY IT WAS JD SALINGER ESPECIALLY FRANNY AND COOEY HIS CHARACTERS ARE OFTEN EXTREMITIES BUT THEY VE BEEN VERY INSPIRING
FOR BETTER OR WORSE

BOOK IS PHILOSOPHICAL SINCE I WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT I BELIEVE TO CREATOR WHO CAUSED THE UNIVERSE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE TO ANY RELIGION
THIS BOOK GAVE A COUNTER ARGUMENT AGAINST ATHEISTS PARTICULARLY STEPHEN HAWKING I AM INCLINED IN PHYSICS BUT THE CLAIM OF HAWKING THAT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS FOR EXISTENCE OF UNIVERSE CAN DENY THE EXISTENCE OF CREATOR DOES NOT PLEASE ME THIS BOOK REALLY SHAPED MY METAPHYSICAL VIEW OF THE WORLD

I AM CURRENTLY READING AGE OF REASON BY THOMAS PAINE WHO ALSO DEBUNKED RELIGIONS FOR THE ILLUSION AND DAMAGE THEY BROUGHT TO MANKIND
NOT A LITERARY STAND OUT BUT BEAR GHYLLS AUTOBIOGRAPHY MUD SWEAT AND TEARS IS A PHENOMENAL BOOK FOR SOMEONE WHO ENJOYS READING ABOUT ADVENTURE MOTIVATION AND PUSHING YOURSELF TO BE YOUR BEST THE BOOK IS FILLED WITH INSPIRING PIECES OF HIS LIFE THAT I VERY MUCH NEEDED I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS READ

ANY AND ALL BOOKS BY CHRIS CRUTCHER OFFER AN AMAZING PERSPECTIVE ON HOW CIRCUMSTANCES CAN SHAPE PEOPLE'S WORLD-VIEW AND HOW A LITTLE BIT OF KINDNESS PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING CAN GO A LONG WAY WHALE TALK CHINESE HANDCUFFS AND DEADLINE ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPACTFUL I CAN THINK OF

WOW LOT'S OF CLASSICS IN THIS THREAD THE BOOKS THAT SHAPED MY ARE THE FOLLOWING

THE SOLITAIRE MYSTERY AND WORLD BY OSTEIN GAARDER
DAMIAN BY HERMANN HESSE
GUNS GERMS AND STEEL JD
IT WAS A TIE BETWEEN YUKIO MISHIMA THE SEA OF FERTILITY CYCLE IS EPIC VONNEGUT ANYTHING ANTHONY BURGESS ANYTHING AND GEORGE ORWELL ANYTHING I'D CHECK EVERY SECOND HAND BOOKSHOP EVERYWHERE I WENT TO BUY THEM

I'M FOREVER JADED IN FAVOUR OF THE BOOKS BUT CERTAINLY AT THE TIME THEY WERE JUST RIGHT AS AN ANGRY YOUNG NIHILIST
I HAD BEEN THINKING OF DOING ANNA KARENINA FOR THE PROJECT DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEA IF THAT'D BE A GOOD CHOICE I'VE HEARD IT'S CONSIDERING THE GREATEST NOVEL OF ALL TIME AND IT'S PRETTY OUTSIDE OF THE LIT THAT I USUALLY READ TYPICALLY CENTURY AMERICAN
THE MOST MEANINGFUL AND PROFOUND BOOK THAT I CAME ACROSS HAS TO BE JAMES AS A MAN THINKETH
A LOT OF AND SCIENCE FICTION SO I GOT QUITE AN OPEN MIND IF I HAD TO LIST ONE THEN THE DISPOSSESSED BY URSULA LE GUIN BECAUSE OF IT'S PORTRAYAL OF AN ANARCHIST SOCIETY IT STILL FEELS LIKE A VERY SOLID MORALITY
THE TRUTH IS I HOPE THEY SERVE BEER IN HELL BY TUCKER MAX WAS PROBABLY THE MOST INFLUENTIAL BOOK OF MY SOUTH MAINLY BECAUSE IT GOT ME BACK INTO READING IT HAPPENED TO HAVE THAT EFFECT FOR A LOT OF MY FRIENDS ALSO BOOK LIST WAS FULL OF MANY OF THE SUGGESTIONS POSTED HERE WHICH IS HOW I STUMBLED UPON THE ALCHEMIST PAULO COELHO WHICH THEN LITERALLY CHANGED MY LIFE IT'S A SOUL TOUCHING BOOK THAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF NEARLY EVERYTHING

FROM THERE I REMEMBER MOVING ON TO THOMAS JEFFERSON THE ART OF POWER HIS BIOGRAPHY AND I FOUND MYSELF MIDWAY THROUGH REALIZING I DIDN'T WANT TO READ A BOOK ON JEFFERSON I WANTED TO READ THE BOOKS HE READ I WANTED TO GET HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD SO I LOOKED INTO THE JEFFERSON BIBLE STARTED A SPIRITUAL ENDEAVOR WHICH MAJOR BOOKS I REMEMBER BEING END OF FAITH SAM HARRIS TAO OF POOH BENJAMIN HOF TUESDAY'S WITH MORRIE MITCH ALBM THE LAST LECTURE RANDY BAUSCH THESE BOOKS ALL TOGETHER HELPED ME LEARN THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FAITH AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN PHYSICAL PRESENCE AND MENTAL PRESENCE HOW TO LIVE AND HOW TO DIE

THE NEXT BOOK CAME TO ME AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME IT IS DRIVE DANIEL PINK IT IS A BOOK THAT AFTER WATCHING A VERY COMPELLING DOCUMENTARY SERIES ZEITGEIST REALLY DROVE HOME A NEW REALITY OF HUMAN NATURE FOR ME GROWING UP IN THE CAPITALIST SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES WE GET A REAL BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE BASICALLY ADAM SMITH MIXED WITH MACHIAVELLI THIS BOOK FLIPS OUR BELIEFS OF THE CARROT AND THE STICK MOTIVATOR ON ITS HEAD IT MADE ME EMPATHIZE GREATLY WITH MY GENERATION THAT BLINDLY WENT FORWARD IN SCHOOL AND CAREERS WITHOUT ANY REAL QUESTIONING OF THEIR OWN MOTIVATIONS IT WAS SIMPLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO

THIS ANSWER MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EXACTLY BUT I FELT COMPELLED TO WRITE MY STORY I THINK BECAUSE I READ A LOT OF THE BOOKS PEOPLE SAY HERE AS WELL A LOT OF THOSE BOOKS YOU SIT WITH AND THEY STAY WITH YOU SUBCONSCIOUSLY FOR A WHILE THEY APPEAR IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE AND YOU SAY OH AHAB OR AH THE UNIVERSE SPEAKING TO ME AGAIN BUT SOME BOOKS JUST BLACK AND WHITE BUILD STRUCTURE INTO YOUR IDENTITY WHICH IS WHAT WE DO IN OUR TWENTIES WE TRY AND UNDERSTAND AS MUCH OF THE WORLD AS POSSIBLE WE TRY TO GET ALL THE ANSWERS AND WE TRY TO MOVE FORWARD THEY MAY BE GREAT FOR YOUR SUBJECT BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOMETIMES QUESTIONS YOU SIT WITH REPETITIVELY IN YOUR SOUTH AND ALL THESE BOOKS TOUCH ON MULTIPLE QUESTIONS SOMETIMES THOUGH YOU NEED TO FIND THE SOURCE OF YOUR QUESTION IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH DEATH I DARE YOU TO READ TUESDAY'S WITH MORRIE AND NOT COME OUT FEELING MORE AT PEACE THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT

WITH ALL THAT SAID I WOULD USE ALICE IN WONDERLAND FOR YOUR PROJECT IT'S A BOOK FULL OF SYMBOLISM AND EASY TO READ OVER AND OVER AGAIN ANNA KARENINA IS HARD ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH ONCE LET ALONE TWICE IN A SINGLE SEMESTER PLUS YOU CAN LEARN THE MOST VALUABLE LESSON A SINGLE LINE OF LITERATURE HAS TAUGHT ME

YOU'RE ENTIRELY BONKERS BUT I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET ALL THE BEST PEOPLE ARE

PAUL AUSTER PARTICULARLY HIS EARLY BOOKS
TRY PAN BY CAVELL THIS BOOK MADE ME REALIZE HOW MUCH MATURING I HAD TO DO
HAMM

I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING MORE FUN OR WELL KNOWN TO EVERYONE THAN THIS ONE BUT FOR MY TWENTIES THIS ONE BOOK JUST KEEPS BECOMING MORE AND MORE RELEVANT THE GOOD EARTH IT'S BY PEARL SOUTH BUCK IT STARTS OUT AS THIS RAGS TO RICHES HISTORICAL DRAMA ABOUT A PEASANT AND HIS FAMILY IN A CHANGING CHINA AT THE END OF THE CENTURY THEN IT TURNS ON IT'S HEAD TOTALLY TO BECOME THIS INCREDIBLY SHARP SOCIAL COMMENTARY ON EVERYTHING FROM GENDER RELATIONS AND PATRIARCHY TO CLASS IN BRITAIN AND CHINA TO EVEN THE DAMN BIBLE IT'S A FUCKING TRIP

I FIND AS I GET OLDER IT KEEPS INFORMING ME ON HOW PEOPLE ACT HOW SOCIAL CHANGE HAPPENS WHY PROGRESS CAN BE SCARY AND DOOMED HOW FAMILIES WORK THE YEARS PASS BUT THE GOOD EARTH KEEPS BECOMING MORE RELEVANT

READ IT IF NOTHING ELSE PEARL SOUTH WRITING STYLE WILL MOST LIKELY REMIND YOU A LOT OF GARM AT CERTAIN POINTS SO IF YOU LIKE GAME OF THRONES THAT'S PRETTY INTERESTING CONSIDERING HOW FAR APART THEIR SUBJECT MATTER COULD BE SAID TO BE
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THOMAS HARDY WORKS I LOVED JUDE THE OBSCURE FAR FROM THE MADDENING CROWD AND THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE

IT WAS A PHASE
ATLAS SHRUGGED AND ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE I'M DIVERSE
BY THE SOUNDS OF IT THIS IS A WATERED DOWN VERSION OF KINDLE UNLIMITED AND IT IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE US RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE ALREADY LIMITED SELECTION OF GOOD BOOKS IN KINDLE UNLIMITED I'M NOT TOO EXCITED TO GET THIS IN CANADA SURE FREE BOOKS ARE FREE BOOKS BUT AS I WAS BROWSING THROUGH THE SELECTION AVAILABLE FOR THE FULL KINDLE UNLIMITED I FOUND ONLY A HANDFUL OF BOOKS I WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY READ
IS THIS THE PRIME LENDING LIBRARY I LOOKED THOUGH THAT THE OTHER DAY AND IT SEEMS LIKE OF THE BOOKS ARE HOW TO USE PRIME I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING I WANTED TO READ
THE LIBRARY'S DIGITAL COLLECTION FAR SURPASSES ANYTHING AMAZON HAS THROWN OUT THERE SO FAR AND BEFORE YOU SAY I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA WITH A SHITTY LIBRARY AND NO DIGITAL SELECTION AND MY DOG HAS AIDS LET ME JUST REMIND YOU THAT WE LIVE IN AND MANY STATE LIBRARIES ALLOW PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE CLOSE TO THEM TO GET AT LEAST A DIGITAL MEMBERSHIP FOR INSTANCE I DO NOT LIVE IN CLEVELAND HOWEVER THIS HAS NOT STOPPED ME FROM LEGITIMATELY OBTAINING A CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP SO IF YOU LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE FOR SOME REASON DO A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE LARGE CITIES AND THEIR LIBRARIES IN YOUR STATE OR GIVE THEM A CALL

ALSO I'LL JUST REMIND YOU KINDLE BOOKS OBTAINED VIA THE LIBRARY HAVE THE EXACT SAME COPY PROTECTION ON THEM THAT KINDLE BOOKS OBTAINED VIA AMAZON PURCHASE HAVE
THIS IS KIND OF LAME IT'S THE SAME BOOKS WRITTEN BY FRIENDS OF NEW YORK TIMES EDITORS STUFF WE'VE BEEN SEEING AND BEING DISAPPOINTED BY ALL YEAR
GREAT THANKS FOR POSTING THIS I PERSONALLY CAN'T WAIT FOR NPR TO COME OUT WITH THEIR BEST BOOKS OF THE BOOK CONCIERGE THING I THINK IT SHOULD BE SOON
I DISMISSED THE LIST WHEN I SAW BEFORE THE FALL BY NOAH HAWLEY THEY AREN'T LISTING GOOD BOOKS THAT THEY LIKED JUST ANY POPULAR ONES THAT HAD SOME HYPE AND PICKING BOOKS IS OVERKILL IF THEY PICKED IT WOULD GIVE THOSE SELECTIONS A LOT MORE WEIGHT
LS SHOULD STAY WHERE SHE IS
THIS IS PATHETIC
SO IT'S FANFICITON THESE AUTHORS ARE PATHETIC AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS SELLING THE RIGHTS TO THESE WORKS ARE EVEN WORSE
HOW IS THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB COMPARED TO TRILOGY I STOPPED AFTER HORNETS NEST CAUSE I WASN'T SURE ABOUT READING SOMEONE ELSES INTERPRETATION
THIS GOES FOR EVEN THE BOURNE SERIES BUT SERIOUSLY THEY SHOULD STOP MAKING THESE SEQUELS THEY MOSTLY RUIN THE ORIGINAL EXPERIENCE ARE MOSTLY A MONEY MAKING SCHEME PIGGYBACKING OFF OF THE ORIGINAL FRANCHISE

THIS NEEDS TO STOP BUT I KNOW IT WON'T HAPPEN
GOOD I'M GLAD THIS SERIES IS CONTINUING
TUBERCULOSIS WAS IN DECLINE WHICH WAS BAD FOR BUSINESS

I
I KNOW SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE TO READ AND THEY PRETTY MUCH FOLLOW THE DEMOGRAPHICS OUTLINED BY PEW HIGH-SCHOOL OR LESS LOW PAYING JOB NO SMART PHONE A COUPLE OF THEM HAVE LEARNING DISABILITIES THAT MAKE READING A HASSLE

THEY JUST WANT TO TURN OFF WHEN THEY GET HOME FROM WORK AND AFTER MAKING DINNER MAKING SURE HOMEWORK IS DONE HOUSE IS TIDIED KIDS ARE SHOWERED TEETH ARE BRUSHED AND NO ONE IS SNEAKING OUT OF BED FOR A GLASS OF WATER THEY SPEND THE WEEKENDS CATCHING UP ON CHORES OR WORKING A SECOND JOB THOUGH IT DOES MAKE ME A LITTLE SAD THAT THE KIDS MAY BE MISSING OUT ON THE MYRIAD BENEFITS OF BOOK CULTURE I CAN'T JUDGE THEM

ANECDOTAL STORY YEARS AGO WHEN THOSE HARRY POTTER MOVIES WERE STILL COMING OUT I KNEW A GUY WHO WAS SOMETHING OF A ANYWAYS HE ONCE TOLD ME HE WAS EXCITED TO SEE ONE OF THOSE SAID HARRY POTTER MOVIES AND I GIVING HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ASKED IF HE READ THE BOOKS AT ALL HIS RESPONSE WAS LITERALLY I DON'T READ BOOKS BOOKS ARE STUPID AN HE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT SEEMS LIKE A JOKE OR ANYTHING IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I WITNESSED AN ADULT SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS BEWILDERED BY HIS CANDOR
AS SOMEONE WHO HASN'T READ A FULL BOOK SINCE CHILDHOOD I CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FOR ME I STRUGGLE WITH BOOKS MAINLY THE MEMORY SIDE OF THINGS I'D READ CHAPTERS ONE NIGHT THEN THE NEXT DAY I'D COMPLETELY FORGET WHAT I HAD JUST READ THE NIGHT BEFORE ALTHOUGH I DON'T EXPECT MYSELF TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER EVERY SINGLE DETAIL IT'S EXTREMELY DEMORALIZING WHEN YOU READ A REALLY NICE LINE IN A BOOK THEN JUST CAN'T REMEMBER IT THE NEXT DAY I THINK IT'S TO DO WITH TEXT JUST NOT BEING MEMORABLE TO ME OR SOMETHING
OF ADULTS DOESN'T READ A SINGLE BOOK IN A YEAR THAT'S QUITE A LOT BUT MORE OR LESS WHAT I'D EXPECT
I WONDER ABOUT THIS DATA IN BRAZIL
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY PEOPLE ALWAYS SEEM SO CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE READING NOT TRYING TO HATE OR ANYTHING BUT NO ONE IS CONCERNED WHEN PEOPLE WATCH LESS TV OR LISTEN TO LESS MUSIC I KNOW READING IS GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED WITH TV WHICH IS ARGUABLY BAD FOR YOUR BRAIN BUT WE DON'T GET THIS CONCERNED WHEN PEOPLE DON'T DO OTHER GOOD FOR YOU THINGS WHY IS PEOPLE NOT READING SUCH A BIG DEAL LOOKING FOR AN HONEST EXPLANATION REALLY NOT TRYING TO BE NEGATIVE
HOW CAN SO MANY HIGH SCHOOLERS NOT READ FOR A YEAR AREN'T NOVELS ASSIGNED TO BE READ IN SCHOOL
THOSE LIVING IN HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN AND THOSE WHO HAVE NO MORE THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR DID NOT GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO REPORT THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A PUBLIC LIBRARY

ARE THEY SURE BECAUSE AT MOST OF THE LIBRARIES I GO TO THESE ARE OFTEN THE PEOPLE SITTING AT THE COMPUTERS LOOKING AT FACEBOOK PORN WHILE THEIR KIDS RUN AROUND SCREAMING UNATTENDED
I USE TO NOT READ AT ALL THIS SEMESTER I HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF READING INTENSIVE CLASSES AND IT CHANGED MY WHOLE VIEW ON BOOKS AND READING I FIND MYSELF CRAVING TO READ NOW I LOVE IT
I AM SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE PROUD OF NOT READING ANYTHING BEYOND A MAGAZINE I KNOW PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO BRAG ABOUT NOT OPENING A BOOK SINCE SCHOOL WITH SOME OF THEM IN THEIR EVEN MY FAMILY WAS SPLIT ABOUT WITH HALF BEING CONSTANT DAILY READERS AND THE OTHER HALF NEVER READING UNLESS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED

MY WIFE AND I HAVE READ THOUSANDS OF BOOKS OUR SON AT HAS PROBABLY READ TOTAL AND OF THOSE WERE REQUIRED FOR SCHOOL
MOST AMERICANS IS THIS LIKE THAT ARTICLE THAT ALLEGED AMERICANS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH BOOKS

EDIT IT IS NOT LIKE THAT ARTICLE
MOST PEOPLE
I READ IT I DON'T HAVE RULES FOR MYSELF OTHER THAN TO READ AND ENJOY
YO YOU'RE OVER THINKING THIS READ WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU CAN READ MORE THAN ONE BOOK AT A TIME BTW
READ WHAT YOU WANT TO READ NOT WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO READ
WHY DO YOU HAVE A DREADED PILE AT ALL GIVE THOSE AWAY AND READ BOOKS YOU WANT TO READ
I ACCRUE FINES UNTIL I READ IT I TYPICALLY PAY THE LIBRARY UP TO TWO OR THREE TIMES A YEAR
I READ WHAT AI FEEL LIKE GENERALLY I STICK WITH ONE BOOK TO COMPLETION BUT IT ONLY TAKES A DAY TO KNOCK ONE OFFICIAL
I TOTALLY GET THIS QUESTION STUDYING LITERATURE AT UNIVERSITY ALWAYS MAKES ME CHOOSE BETWEEN WHAT I WANT TO READ AND WHAT I HAVE TO READ THOUGH AFTER A WHILE THERE IS SOME NOTICEABLE OVERLAP

I TRIED THE SYSTEM WITH ONE NOVEL FOR UNIVERSITY THEN ONE FOR MYSELF THEN ONE FOR UNIVERSITY AGAIN AND SO FORTH ULTIMATELY THAT DIDN'T QUITE WORK THE WAY I WANTED

RIGHT NOW I'M USING A SYSTEM WHERE I READ 2 MAX BOOKS AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ALWAYS AN ASSIGNED NUMBER OF PAGES ON THE UNI TEXT AND THEN I'M FREE TO READ FOR MY OWN PLEASURE WHICH IS SOMETIMES DIVIDED INTO FICTION AND DEPENDING ON MY MOOD
TOO SHORT TO PUT OFF THE BOOKS YOU REALLY WANT TO READ
I JUST START IT RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT FOUR BOOKS I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF
I READ THE BOOK I WANT TO READ I DO TRY TO LEAVE A GAP BETWEEN BOOK ORDERS TO ENCOURAGE MYSELF TO GO BACK TO THE TO READ PILE BUT IF I REALLY WANT TO READ SOMETHING I READ IT
INTENTIONALLY BECOME ILL RATHER TAKE PILLS THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SHIT YO
IF THERE IS NO REASON TO GET OTHER READING DONE BEFORE THE BOOK YOU WANT TO READ MOST READING FOR SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE THEN JUST LET THAT BOOK BE YOUR TOP PRIORITY
IT'S CALLED PRIORITY QUEUE USE IT WISELY
SCREW THE PILE READ THE BOOK LOL

SERIOUSLY IF YOU AREN'T READING THEM NOT BECAUSE OF PROCRASTINATION BECAUSE YOU AREN'T IN THE MOOD YOU AREN'T GONNA ENJOY IT ANYWAYS SO JUST READ WHATEVER YOU WANT TO READ
I READ WHATEVER I'M IN THE MOOD TO READ AT THE TIME WHEN I LIMIT MYSELF TO TRYING TO FINISH ONE BOOK WITHOUT STARTING ANOTHER I USUALLY END UP READING MORE SLOWLY THEN IF I HAD JUST WHAT READ WHAT I WANTED TO READ AND COME BACK TO THE OTHER BOOK LATER
I HAVE NEVER FELT OBLIGATED TO FINISH A BOOK
READ WHATEVER YOU WANT TO READ WHENEVER YOU WANT TO READ IT YOU COULD BE HIT BY A BUS TOMORROW OR THE SUN MIGHT EXPLODE
THIS IS THE FIRST I'VE HEARD OF HIM CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT HIS WRITING
I READ RIDLEY WALKER EARLIER THIS YEAR AND IT WAS PRETTY MIND BENDING I DID FEEL LIKE BY WRITING SUCH A PHILOSOPHICALLY ABSTRACT BOOK IN SUCH A DENSE DIALECT HE RAN THE RISK OF LOSING A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT I AGREE IT IS SUCH A STRANGE AND EERIE WORK AND UNLIKE ANY OTHER APOCALYPSE NOVEL I'VE EVER READ I HEARD THAT DAVID MITCHELL TOOK INSPIRATION FROM IT FOR THE CROSSING SECTION OF CLOUD ATLAS I CAN BELIEVE IT
I'M PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO'S MENTIONED HOBAN IN THE PAST YEARS PURPOSELY NAME-DROPPING CAIMAN AND BOWIE EULOGIES

PILGERMANN HERE IS AS AWESOME AN OPENING LINE AS CALL ME ISHMAEL MANY REVIEWERS REFER TO DEEP RELIGIOSITY BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ONE OF THE FEW WORKS THAT DESCRIBES WHAT ART IS IT TAKES A LOT OF THOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND HOTNESS AND GONENESS I COULD READ TIMES EVERY CONVERSATION BETWEEN PILGERMANN AND BEBEL RUDZUK

I DISCOVERED RUSSEL HOBAN IN GRANTA SHORT STORY A CONVERSATION WITH THE HEAD OF ORPHEUS WHICH LATER BECAME MEDUSA FREQUENCY FOR ME SHORT STORY WAS THE LITERARY LIGHTNING BOLT THE ONLY BOOKS I'VE READ WITH SIMILAR EFFECT ARE TENSE EAST SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM AND TIM GOING AFTER CACCIATTO

TURTLE DIARY REMAINS MY RECOMMENDATION FOR THE EVER POPULAR QUESTION OF BOOK VS MOVIE AND AGAIN PURPOSELY NAME-DROP THAT MARSHA MASON AND BEN KINGSLEY BOTH SAY IT'S THEIR BEST WORK

RUSSEL LATER WORKS ARE VARIED I READ A CLAIM THAT GROTTO IS FIRST NOVEL TO LITERARILY DEAL WITH INTERNET PORNOGRAPHY AMARYLLIS NIGHT AND DAY IS JUST A BEAUTIFUL DREAM AND GETS MY VOTE FOR PRETTIEST TITLE EVER
HA I JUST GOOGLED HIM AND HE WROTE THE BEDTIME FOR FRANCES A BIRTHDAY FOR FRANCES ETC BOOKS I REMEMBER THOSE FROM MY CHILDHOOD THANKS FOR THE TIP I'LL CHECK OUT HIS BOOKS FOR ADULTS
ULTIMATE PHILOSOPHICAL NOVEL CAMUS DOES NOT COMPUTE
DIDN'T HE TRAIN THEN ASSASSINATE COMMODUS
SHERMAN ALEXEI THE ABSOLUTELY TRUE DIARY OF A PART TIME INDIAN RESERVATION BLUES THE LONE RANGER AND TONTO FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN ETC

LOUISE ERDRICH THE LAST REPORT ON THE MIRACLES AT LITTLE NO HORSE THE ROUND HOUSE ETC
ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T TERM HIMSELF AS AN INDIGENOUS AUTHOR I CANNOT RECOMMEND JOSEPH WORKS ENOUGH HE HAS A WAY OF MAKING YOUR HEART WRENCH BY THE END OF THE NOVEL BUT ALSO FEEL AT PEACE
LOVE HOUSE MADE OF DAWN ITS FRACTURED NARRATIVE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE BUT I'D SAY MONANDAY IS ONE OF THE BEST LIVING AMERICAN WRITERS
INTERESTING IT'S A SHAME INDIGENOUS IS LIMITED TO PEOPLES THOUGH
IT'S NOT WRITTEN BY AN INDIGENOUS WRITER BUT BRAIN BY ORIN STARN IS PHENOMENAL
GOOD QUESTION THERE REALLY AREN'T THAT MANY INSTAGRAM SEEMS TO BE THE BEST BUT IT'S NOT REALLY IN BLOG FORMAT BUT I USE IT TO INTERACT WITH OTHER COLLECTORS MY COLLECTION HAS BECOME PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL BUT MANY LIKE ME JUST DON'T CARE TO BLOG ABOUT IT OR GIVE AWAY OUR SECRETS TO FINDING CRAZY GOOD DEALS

THERE ARE ALSO SOME OF US ON GR BUT COLLECTORS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN ON THERE

SADLY BROOKSIDE IS THE ONLY HALFWAY DECENT BLOG I'VE EVER FOUNDATION I'VE LOOKED FOR ACTIVE DEDICATED FORUMS BEFORE AS WELL AND THEY DON'T EXIST EITHER
THERE ARE ONLY THREE STORIES IN LITERATURE A MAN GOES ON A JOURNEY A STRANGER COMES TO TOWN AND GODZILLA VS MEGA SHARK LEO TOLSTOY
THEY MISSED AND SERIOUSLY THOUGH IF THEY WILL DO SUCH OVERSIMPLIFICATION WHY NOT GO THE EXTRA YARD AND STATE THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO EMOTIONAL STORYLINES RISE FALL IT'S JUST AS UNTRUE
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT ANYONE WHO SUBSCRIBED TO THIS BELIEF THINKS THE GREAT GATSBY FALLS UNDER

WHILE WE'RE AT IT CATCHER IN THE RYE AND TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD OR ANY OTHER BOOK WITH AN OBSERVER AS THE NARRATOR AND A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON ANALYZING SURROUNDINGS OF THE TIMES AND PEOPLE RATHER THAN A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON THINGS DONE BY OR TO THE NARRATOR
THE STUDY IS REALLY INTERESTING BUT THEY ONLY USED BOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG WHICH MEANS THAT THE STORIES THEY TOOK WHERE PRETTY OLD NO LONGER COPYRIGHTED OR AM I WRONG HERE I COULD IMAGINE THAT THE WAY PEOPLE USED TO WRITE INCLUDING MORE RIGID RULES WHEN IT COMES TO COULD CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THIS STUDY
I ALWAYS WONDER WHAT IS THE POINT OF THESE REDUCTIVE STORY ARC THINGS ANALYSIS WAS A TOUR DE FORCE BUT HE NEVER PRETENDED IT WAS ANYTHING GREAT JUST A CLEVER BIT OF FUN STORY ARCS ARE ONE PART OF THE PICTURE BUT YOU CAN'T DEFINE A GREAT NOVEL OR DRAMA THROUGH THEM
I CALL BS SCROOGE MALDUCK GOES FROM RICH TO RICHER RISE TO RISE ALL THE TIME I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT THERE'S STORIES WHERE A SHITTY SITUATION JUST GOES SHITTIER FALL TO FALL SEE GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES FOR EXAMPLE
REAGAN AND COLLEAGUES THUS DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE ONLY SIX MAIN EMOTIONAL STORYLINES THESE INCLUDE RAGS TO RICHES SENTIMENT RISES RICHES TO RAGS FALL MAN IN A HOLE ICARUS CINDERELLA OEDIPUS THIS APPROACH COULD IN TURN BE USED TO CREATE COMPELLING STORIES BY GAINING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAS PREVIOUSLY MADE FOR GREAT STORYLINES IT COULD ALSO HELP TEACH COMMON SENSE TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS
BREAKING NEWS ALL BOOKS CONTAIN PAGES ALMOST ALWAYS WITH IMAGES OR TEXT PRINTED ON THEM ALL BOOKS ARE THEREFORE THE SAME
WELL SURE IF WE ABSTRACT THINGS ENOUGH WE CAN REDUCE ANY COMPLEX SET OF CASES DOWN TO A BINARY OPTION AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID HERE EITHER THINGS ARE RISING OR FALLING OR ITS ALTERNATING IN SOME SERIES LIKE ETC

EDIT THEY TOOK THE FIRST EIGHT NUMBERS IN BINARY AND COLLAPSED S AND S IN A ROW

REDUCED TO
REDUCED TO

REDUCED TO

REDUCED TO
REDUCED TO
REDUCED TO
THIS JUST SEEMS LIKE AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF POTLINES THAT'S LIKE SAYING THERE'S ONLY 2 KINDS OF HUMANS THOSE WITH BREASTS AND THOSE WITHOUT YET OF COURSE THIS STATEMENT FAILS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INDIVIDUALITY IN TERMS OF HOPES DREAMS PERSONALITIES AND WANTS

A BOOK IS DEFINED BY ITS CHARACTERS THEIR MOTIVATIONS THE WORLD THE SETTING AND HOW ALL OF THESE INTERACT WITH PLOT WITH SO MANY VARIABLES INVOLVED IT IS A GROSS INJUSTICE TO BOOKS TO CLAIM THERE ARE ONLY SIX EMOTIONAL
YEAH SURE BUT DOES THAT REALLY TELL US ANYTHING MORE THAN IN A OF BILLION STORIES SOMETHING OTHER THAN NOTHING HAPPENED ALSO WHAT ABOUT ALBERT THE STRANGER IF YOU THINK MEURSAULT FELL YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK
DELETED
THERE IS ONLY ONE BEGINNING END

THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS SOUNDS INTERESTING BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AT ALL IT IS REALLY NOT I COULD ALSO JUST BE SUMMED UP BY THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN IN YOUR FICTION WHICH IS YOU KNOW NOT NEWS
WELL HUMANS ARE PRETTY WE ALL PRETEND TO BE UNIQUE I SUPPOSE THE SAME APPLIES TO STORIES
SHOWING EIGHT VARIATIONS A GRAPHIC HETP I SAVED FROM IMAGER A WHILE BACK

FROM MAYA EILA HETP
WHEN'S VONNEGUT WRONG
I HAVE TO DISAGREE WHILE IT WASN'T A BOOK AND IT GOT POOR RECEPTION I WOULD DESCRIBE TRUE DETECTIVE SEASON 2 AS A NOBODY RISES THEY JUST ARE AND THEN BAD STUFF HAPPENS PRESUMABLY ONE COULD WRITE A BOOK WITH A SIMILAR STORY LINE
ISN'T CONFLICT THE OVERRIDING PREMISE IN ALMOST ALL FICTION NO MATTER THE MEDIUM IS THERE A SINGLE FICTIONAL BOOK OR MOVIE THAT DOESN'T CONTAIN CONFLICT IT'S THE BASIS OF OUR LANGUAGE YES NUMBER LOVE HATE RIGHT WRONG
I'VE SEEN THIS ARGUMENT BEFORE THIS IS NOT MILD-BLOWING NEWS

A BETTER TITLE WOULD BE PROGRAMS FIND THAT STORIES ARE BUILT FROM BASIC BLOCKS NO ONE IS SURPRISED
THEY FORGOT RISE FALL RISE FALL HARDER RISE HARDER
THESE RESULTS AREN'T UNIQUE TO STORYLINES IF YOU RUN SD ON TIME SERIES DATASET YOU'LL GET BASES THAT LOOK A LOT LIKE THE FOURIER BASES IN OTHER WORDS IT'S EFFICIENT TO DESCRIBE THE DATA AS A SUM OF SINE WAVES
THE TOP COMMENTS HAVE GOTTEN OFF TRACK HERE THINKING THE STUDY IS MOOT OR BAD BECAUSE OF IT BEING SIMPLIFIED I'M GUESSING THE COMMENTATORS ARE MORE READERS AUTHORS AND NOT SO MUCH DATA SCIENTISTS


THE OBSERVATION IS A GOOD ONE AS VONNEGUT TRIED TO MAKE IT BACK IN THE DAY
THE SIX STORY LINES ARE TESTED OUT OF HUNDRED OR SO BOOKS

RAGS TO RICHES RISE

TRAGEDY OR RICHES TO RAGS FALL

MAN IN A HOLE

ICARUS

CINDERELLA

OEDIPUS

I LOVE VONNEGUT BUT I FEEL LIKE WE'RE APPROACHING JERK TERRITORY OF THE CIRCULAR VARIETY
REDUCTIONISM SUCKS
THERE ARE ALSO ONLY LETTERS IN THE ALPHABET AND ONLY NOTES IN A SCALE BUT SOMEHOW WE KEEP WRITING NEW BOOKS AND SONGS

WELL OKAY MAYBE NOT SONGS
ARISTOTLE MAY BE TO BLAME FOR THIS SORT OF IDIOCY BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THE POETICS ESSENTIALLY THE FIRST WORK AND THE TEMPLATE FOR ANALYZING FICTION IS WILDLY MISUNDERSTOOD PLEASE FORGIVE A LONG DIGRESSION

THE CRUCIAL THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT ARISTOTLE IS HE WAS A BIOLOGIST AT HEART HE'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO SPEND A LAZY SUNDAY AFTERNOON DISSECTING A CUTTLEFISH AND WHEN HE GOT AROUND TO PLAYS HE'D DO THE SAME THING CUT ONE OPEN AND SEE WHAT THE PIECES ARE HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER AH LOOK AT THAT A HIGH BORN HERO HAS A LOT MORE TO LOSE AND A LOT FARTHER TO FALL SO WHEN A REVERSAL COMES IT'S GOT A LOT MORE IMPACT WHEN THOR SON OF ODIN HITS THE SKIDS THAN SOME LOSER SHOE SALESMAN IN CLEVELAND

ARI WAS ALSO AND THIS WAS CRUCIAL HAVING A FIGHT WITH PLATO HE WASN'T DISSECTING LITERATURE FOR FUN HE WAS DOING IT BECAUSE PLATO WAS BEING A FATHEAD AND ARI WAS GOING TO PROVE HIM WRONG HE BEGAN AS A SCIENTIST WOULD MAKING OBSERVATIONS AND DRAWING CONCLUSIONS HOW WOULD HE APPROACH THAT PROCESS WITH SAY BIRDS CATALOGUE AND CLASSIFY ALL THE TYPES OF BIRDS ON AN ISLAND IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU FIRST HAVE TO NAIL DOWN WHAT A BIRD IS WHAT DEFINES IT IS IT THE WINGS INSECTS HAVE WINGS FLYING NOT ALL BIRDS FLY AND SO ON SO HE WORKED OUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLAYS NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAYING LOOK THERE'S ONLY SIX BUT TO NAIL DOWN THE COMMON THING THEY HAD THE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE SERVICE THEY OFFERED TO SOCIETY SO HE COULD HIT PLATO OVER THE HEAD WITH IT SEE LOOK AT THIS THE ARTS ARE USEFUL

YOU REALLY CANNOT GET FARTHER FROM THAT ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF LITERARY ANALYSIS BY IRONICALLY A SUPREMELY SCIENTIFIC MIND THAN THE SO-CALLED SCIENTISTS REFERENCED BY THIS ARTICLE

THIS JUST IN EVERY SONG IS EXACTLY THE SAME

INTRO VERSE CHORUS VERSE CHORUS BRIDGE CHORUS

I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE WASTE THEIR TIME EXPLAINING WHAT EVERYBODY ALREADY KNOWS
I'M NOT SURE VONNEGUT WAS THE FIRST TO DESCRIBE THIS BUT PROBABLY TRUE

THERE ARE COMMERCIAL SCREENPLAY WRITING PACKAGES THAT POSIT THIS AND HELP YOU ORGANIZE ALONG EXACTLY SUCH THEMES ARCHES
GREAT PAPER I WAS PARTICULARLY MOVED BY THIS PASSAGE


D BI B L T BI T B T

REALLY NAILED IT

ACTUALLY I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING A LARGE DATA SET OF FILM AND TV SCRIPTS I'VE HEARD RUMOR OF SUCH THINGS

HERE IS AN INTERESTING ARTICLE ON STORY THEORIES

THEORY

I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TOO FAR INTO DRAMATIC SOFTWARE YET BUT I'VE READ A TON OF JOSEPH CAMPBELL SOME CHRISTOPHER VOGLER AND SOME JOHN TRUBY

BACK TO ARTICLE AS A READER I STRIVE ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND


NABAK I J N D K J N I I


THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT BLUH WHAT ABOUT STORYTELLING ARE WE CHARTING THE EMOTIONAL JOURNEY OF THE CHARACTER AS HE SHE THEORETICALLY EXPERIENCES IT OR THE JOURNEY OR ABSTRACT FILMS THAT USE SOUND OR VISUALS TO CREATE EMOTIONAL CONTEXT MORE THAN STORYLINE
NOT ONLY OS THIS OVERSIMPLIFICATION LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID THIS IS IDIOTIC THEIR CATEGORIES ARE JUST THE PERMUTATIONS OF THE THEMES RISE AND FALL IF YOU COMBINE CONGRUENT THEMES INTO ONE MOVEMENT FALL FALL BECOMES JUST ONE FALL WITH CRITERIA LIKE THIS THERE IS LITERALLY NO OTHER CONCLUSION THEY COULD HAVE ARRIVED AT AS SOON AS THEY DEFINED THE PARAMETERS OF THEIR DATA THEY COULD HAVE COMPLETED THE STUDY WITHOUT DOING THE STUDY

MOVEMENT STORIES RISE OR FALL

2 MOVEMENT STORIES RISE FALL OR FALL RISE

MOVEMENT STUDIES SINCE BECOME COMBINED THIS ONLY LEAVE YOU WITH ALTERNATIONS SO RISE FALL RISE AND FALL RISE FALL

MOVEMENT FALL RISE FALL RISE AND RISE FALL RISE FALL

THIS PATTERN JUST CONTINUES HOW DO PEOPLE GET PAID FOR THIS GARBAGE



OF COURSE HE IS
VONNEGUT WAS RIGHT
WAIT WHY WOULD HIS MASTER'S THESIS GET REJECTED SEEMS LIKE AN INTERESTING SUBJECT
NEXT STEP AUTOMATION
THERE ARE EXACTLY DIFFERENT POSSIBLE STORY PLOTS


RISE FALL RISE FALL RISE FALL FALL FURTHER RISE
WHICH STORY LINE IS YOUR OWN
COMEDY AND TRAGEDY AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ALL ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PROTAGONIST S IS IN A BETTER PLACE THEN WHERE HE STARTED
EVERY MOVIE HAS AN INTRODUCTION URGENCY SETUP CRISIS AND RESOLUTION COOKIE CUTTER PLOT
VONNEGUT WAS RIGHT STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE AND HE IS INDEED BEAUTIFUL IN THE WATER

SO WE'RE CATEGORIZING EVERYTHING AS GOOD OR BAD NOW THAT'S DEEP
TECHNICALLY THERE'S ONLY A SINGLE STORYLINE IN FICTION THE KIND THAT STARTS AND ENDS



JUST WHILE WE'RE BOILING COMPLEX CONCEPTS DOWN TO ARBITRARY CATEGORIES
SOME PEOPLE HERE HAVE MENTIONED THE BOOK BLOTTO BY WILLIAM WALLACE COOK AS EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY SOME PLOTS WHAT THEY FAIL TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT EACH OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY JUST OF TWO MAJOR PLOT LINES WHICH ARE
ONE'S DESIRE TO SEEK OUT LOVE AND COURTSHIP OR
2 ONE'S ATTEMPT TO REACH SUCCESS WITHIN A PARTICULAR ENTERPRISE

SEEMS REASONABLE TO ME
ALL GREAT BOOK HAVE A SINGLE STORY LINE
STUFF HAPPEN
RIDICULOUS FINDINGS
IN THE END DOESN'T IT SIMPLY COME DOWN TO COMEDY OR TRAGEDY

I'VE TRULY ALWAYS FELT THIS WAY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVERY STORY HAS ALREADY BEEN TOLD EVERYTHING CAN BE MUTATED TO SEEM FRESH AND ORIGINAL AND IT USUALLY ENDS UP DOING THE JOB BUT I WILL ALWAYS REFER BACK TO A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH MY BEST FRIEND WHO CAN NEVER ENJOY HARRY POTTER BECAUSE IN HER OPINION HARRY AND HERMIONE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS SOUL MATES MY ARGUMENT LEADS BACK TO STAR WARS IT'S THE LUKE AND LEIA CONCEPT THE OBVIOUS OUTCOME JUST CAN'T BE THERE IS ALWAYS A TWIST ENDING
I READ THIS WONDERING WHERE MY NOVEL WOULD FIT IN THIS FORTUNATELY FALL RISE WORKS FOR ME AS IT FITS THE CHARACTER ARC AND THE STORY IS SET IN THE TRENCHES OF WWI
THIS IS SUCH A SUBJECTIVE ARGUMENT IT'S A NOVEL
SO HOW MANY STORYLINES ARE USED IN GENERAL NON FICTION
I'D LIKE TO SEE WHICH CATEGORY THEY BELIEVE BERSERK FALLS INTO
IN THE CENTURY GEORGE LOTI DEFINED DRAMATIC SITUATIONS AND THEY ARE MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THE THAT THE RESEARCHERS FOUNDATION

LIBRARY DOCUMENTS COMICS

HOW IS CINDERELLA
OWN CAT'S CRADLE DOESN'T FIT THESE CATEGORIES
I READ THE RESEARCH ARTICLE LOST THE THREAD A BIT WITH SOME OF THE ALGORITHM STUFF BUT I KEPT PRETTY GOOD PACE

THE IMPORTANT FROM THIS RESEARCH IN MY OPINION IS THIS THE APPLICABILITY TO A I EVERYONE SAYING THE NARRATIVES ARE OBVIOUS OR USELESS IS THINKING ABOUT IT TOO ANTHROPOCENTRICALLY IT'S ONLY OBVIOUS BECAUSE IT WAS POINTED OUT TO YOU IF I ASKED ANY OF YOU TO COME UP WITH THE SAME I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD THE RESEARCHERS USED DIFFERENT METHODS TO EVALUATE THE BOOKS SO THE RESULTS ARE PRETTY ROBUST OF COURSE IT SEEMS INTUITIVE TO US NOW BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SUBTLY CARRYING AROUND THAT KNOWLEDGE BUT THIS STUFF WOULDN'T BE INTUITIVELY OBVIOUS TO AN A I UNLESS IT WAS TRAINED TO THINK THAT WAY I COULD EASILY IMAGINE THIS BEING ONE OF THE WAYS THAT'S DONE

ALL YOU BOOKISH NAYSAYERS SHOULD BE APPRECIATIVE FOR RESEARCH LIKE THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR SEXPOT TO BE CONVERSANT IN HIGHFALUTIN LITERATURE AS IT SEEMS YOU ALL DO THEN THIS IS THE FIRST STEP WE WILL DEFINITELY PASS THE FICTION BOOK TURING TEST BEFORE WE PASS THE CONVERSATION WITH A HUMAN TURING TEST I'M SURE OF THAT IN ANY CASE

THE AUTHORS ARE CLEARLY LITERARY PEOPLE THE PIECE READS LIKE AN MASCULINE A OR PHD PROJECT OF A LITERATURE MAJOR WHO THREW A BUNCH OF DATA AT A NEURAL NETWORK ONE OF THE AUTHORS IS DEFINITELY A LIT GUY SOME OF THE OTHERS ARE DEFINITELY ENGINEERING GUYS I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY ARE ANY OF THEM THE SAME GUY IT'S NOT A BAD MOVE NEURAL NETWORKS ARE PRETTY HOT RIGHT NOW MY OWN MASCULINE A RESEARCH USES NEURAL NETWORKS AND I AM NOT A ENGINEER BY ANY MEANS ALL BOUT THAT COLLABORATIVE SCHOLARSHIP

I WAS SURPRISED THAT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF A I IN THE PAPER IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUCH A NATURAL FIT FOR THIS KIND OF BROAD DATA ANALYSIS THE THESIS DEFINITELY FOCUSED ON THE PRIMAL POWER OF HUMAN STORY TELLING THING HOMO NARRATIVES SIC AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF IT JUST USED BIG DATA AS THE LENS TO EVALUATE IT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM YOUR HUMAN INTERACTION WITH THE FICTION TO EVALUATE IT IN THIS WAY IF THIS SORT OF LITERARY ANALYSIS IS BUNK THEN ISN'T IT ALL BUNK BECAUSE THE ONLY MEANINGFUL DATA IS THE INDIVIDUAL QUALITATIVE EXPERIENCE OF READING THAT'S FINE BUT IT'S NOT THE STUFF SEXPOTS ARE BORN OF

ONCE EVERYONE CHILLS OUT ABOUT IT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK OUT THE HEDONOMETER IT'S FUN YOU CAN SEARCH BY A SPECIFIC BOOK OR CHOOSE A RANDOM BOOK IT DOES HIGHLIGHT THE BIGGEST FLAW IN THE STUDY BY BUILDING A DATA SET OFF OF PROJECT GUTENBERG THEY ARE RESTRICTED TO PUBLIC DOMAIN LITERATURE GRANTED THAT'S A LOT OF LITERATURE BUT THEY ARE MISSING THE STUFF THAT IS PROBABLY MOST LIKELY TO THROW THEIR SORTING ALGORITHMS FOR A LOOP BASICALLY ALL CENTURY LITERATURE IF I HAD THE CASH TO BUY THEM A BUNCH OF MODERN LIT IN FORMAT TO RUN THEIR SOFTWARE ON I WOULD

EDIT PROPOSAL ABOVE RAISES INTERESTING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THESE KINDS OF BIT DATA ANALYSES IS IT COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT FOR INSTANCE TO TRAIN A NEURAL NETWORK ON COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS
SWEET I'M ABOUT TO BLOW THE LITERARY WORLD APART WITH MY EPIC IN PARTS OPTIONED INTO A PART HOLLYWOOD SERIES OF FILMS OF COURSE
THE WITCHER IS A STORY OF A GROUP OF MISFITS TRYING TO FIND LOVE IN A CRUEL AND IMPERSONAL WORLD
SO IT GOES
HAVEN'T READ THE ACTUAL STUDY BUT BASED ON THE ARTICLE THIS IS THE STUPIDEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD

IF YOU COUNT RISE AS FALL AS AS BOTH AND AS AND THEN YOU'VE COVERED EVERY POSSIBLE COLUMN COMBINATION OF RISE AND FALL

SO THE STUDY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAID EVERY FICTION IS COMPOSED OF RISES AND FALLS WELL YEAH NO SHIT SHERLOCK
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'VE DISCOVERED THAT SD RESULTS IN PERIODIC BASIS FUNCTIONS
WELL IF YOU SIMPLIFY OUR STORIES DOWN THIS FAR THERE'S ONLY LIFE AND THEN DEATH I DON'T SEE THE START VS FINISH OF THE BOOK AS THE STORYLINE
I HATE THAT ALL STORIES MOVIES AND MEDIUM HAVE TO HAVE SOME DOWNFALL

JUST OFF THE TOP OF HEAD EXAMPLE OF SUPERBAD WHERE IT'S REALLY FUN AND FUNNY THE FIRST TIME YOU WATCH IT BUT HAS THIS I HATE YOU WE AREN'T BEST FRIENDS DOWNER PART THEN RISE AGAIN BUT IT'S NEVER THE SAME

I WANT A BOOK OR MOVIE THAT CAPTURES THAT FUN BEGINNING TO END I LOVE CANNERY ROW BECAUSE WHILE IT HAS THAT MOMENT OF THE FAILED PARTY IT RECOVERS QUICKLY CORMAC MCCARTHY IS ALSO GREAT AT NOT USUALLY HAVING DIPS IT IS WHAT IT IS
THE STRANGER TO TO
GREAT WAY TO PROACTIVELY RESURFACE A REJECTED THESIS SWEET READ
I DON'T GET IT WHAT IS CLASSIFIED AS A FALL AND A RISE

WHAT WOULD SHERLOCK HOLMES COME UNDER HE DOESN'T REALLY FALL OR RISE PERSONALLY HE ALWAYS SEEMS TO STAY THE SAME LEVEL
IT COULD ALSO HELP TEACH COMMON SENSE TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS


HALACHA HOLY SHIT I HOPE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HILARIOUS
BIG DATA IS BAD IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED REDUCING HUMAN BEHAVIOR TO PATTERNS IS BLINDLY ACCEPTING YOUR COMPUTING OVERLORDS SERIOUSLY THOUGH DATA ISN'T ALWAYS CORRECT AND IS EASILY USED TO CAUSE DISRUPTION THROUGH IDEAS THAT ARE UNTRUE BASED ON FACTS WHICH IS LITTLE MORE THAN PRELIMINARY DATA ANALYSIS
SO IT GOES
I GUARANTEE I CAN MAKE SOMEONE FEEL EMOTION DUE TO THE SHEER OVERWHELMING STAGNATION OF A CHARACTER DRIFTING THROUGH LIFE
TO BE FAIR IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE WAY THEY CATEGORIZE THE STORIES ALLOWING FOR SEGMENTS EACH DESIGNATED RISE OR FALL YIELDS A MAX OF POSSIBLE STORY TYPES
WASN'T THAT SHAKESPEARE THING THAT THERE IS ONLY BASIC THEMES YOU CAN HAVE IN A STORY BETRAYAL LOVE ETC I SAY ETC BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK OF ANY MORE RIGHT NOW I'M VERY TIRED
FREUD WOULD SAYS THERE'S ONLY ONE STORYLINE GUY DOES THINGS BECAUSE HE WANTS TO HAVE SEX WITH HIS MOTHER
OEDIPUS

GIVEN THE ASSOCIATIONS THAT WAS A REALLY UNWANTED MENTAL IMAGE
WELL IT HAS TO BE RELATABLE AND TIME HAS SHOWN THAT THESE STRUCTURES ARE SO IT'S INEVITABLE
I'D LIKE TO HEAR SOME MORE ABOUT THAT AND LEARN WHAT THOSE TYPES ACTUALLY ARE I HOPE THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN THEY DESCRIBE BECAUSE IF THE STUDY JUST RATES EMOTIONS AS HIGH OR LOW THEN LOOK AT THE SHAPE OF THE CURVE I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THOSE STORY TYPES WITHOUT READING A SINGLE BOOK
DOES THE STUDY INCLUDE DISCUSSION OF UNRELIABLE NARRATORS AND OTHER STORIES WHERE WE CAN'T BE SURE WHETHER OR NOT A DEVELOPMENT IS GOOD OR BAD HAMLET FOR EXAMPLE IS CONSIDERED A TRAGEDY BUT DENMARK ARGUABLY ENDS WITH A BETTER RULER THAN CLAUDIUS OR HAMLET I BELIEVE VONNEGUT MADE AN EXTRA CATEGORY FOR THIS CALLED WHICH WAY IS UP
AND SHAKESPEARE DID THEM ALL BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE
VONNEGUT FOR THE WIN I FEEL LIKE NO ONE TRULY APPRECIATED HIM OR HIS MIND VERY UNDERRATED IN MY OPINION
THIS ANALYSIS IS SO FLAWED IN SO MANY WAYS AS I'M SURE SOME OF YOU WILL AGREE

WHAT ABOUT MAN VS MAN MAN VS NATURE INTO THE WILD OR OLD MAN AND THE SEA OR DELIVERANCE MAN VS SELF BLACK SWAN OR ALICE IN WONDERLAND OR THE ALCHEMIST MAN VS SOCIETY FARENHEIT THE HERO CYCLE

THIS STUDY IS DERIVATIVE IN CHARACTER
WELL I MEAN OF COURSE YOU CAN BE REDUCTIVE YOU CAN ALWAYS BE REDUCTIVE
WELL THEY DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB
THIS READS LIKE A SORT OF SCHENKERIAN ANALYSIS FOR LITERATURE TO QUOTE SCHOENBERG WHERE ARE MY FAVORITE PASSAGES AH THERE THEY ARE IN THOSE TINY NOTES

WHILE THE RESULTING FINDING IS PERHAPS OF INTEREST IT HAS LIMITED VALUE OUTSIDE OF EXAMINATIONS OF THIS SORT I'D BE MORE INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO WITH A MORE ANALYSIS AS THAT OFTEN REVEALS INTERESTING ELEMENTS THAT CAN OTHERWISE BE OBSCURED BY FOREGROUND ORNAMENTATION
THERE ARE BUT SIX MUSICAL NOTES YET THEY CAN YIELD MORE SYMPHONIES THAN CAN EVER BE HEARD

THERE ARE BUT FOR FOUR PRINCIPAL TASTES YET THEY YIELD MORE FLAVORS THAN CAN EVER BE TASTED

THERE ARE BUT FIVE BASIC COLORS YET THEY CAN YIELD MORE COLORS THAN CAN EVER BE SEEN

SUN TAU THE ART OF WAR
WHAT WOULD SLAUGHTERHOUSE BE BILLY NEVER REALLY RISES OR FALLS HE JUST IS
VONNEGUT NEVER SAID THERE WERE A SET NUMBER OF STORYLINES INSTEAD HE SHOWED THAT STORIES HAVE SHAPE AS IMPORTANT TO A CULTURE AS ITS POTTERY I BELIEVE HE ONCE SAID
AGAIN THIS HAS BEEN POSTED BEFORE AND BLASTED BEFORE IT'S BOLLOCKS IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT READING BOOKS DOESN'T MAKE YOU SMARTER
MEMORANDUM TO SCIENTISTS

I HAVE A DEGREE IN ENGLISH I AM ACADEMICALLY QUALIFIED TO TEACH STORYTELLING I AM A PUBLISHED AUTHOR I AM PROFESSIONALLY QUALIFIED TO TEACH STORYTELLING

YOU ARE NEITHER

YOU ARE NOT ACADEMICALLY OR PROFESSIONALLY QUALIFIED TO EVEN DISCUSS THESE SUBJECTS MUCH LESS LECTURE THE REST OF US ON THEM AS PRETENTIOUS AS THE TITLE SCIENTIST APPARENTLY MAKES YOU YOUR ASSERTIONS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE DO NOT QUALIFY YOU AS AN EXPERT IN OTHER FIELDS OF STUDY

ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND OTHERS WHO TAKE LETTERS SERIOUSLY ENOUGH TO CALL THEM A CAREER I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO KINDLY REFRAIN FROM HOLDING YOURSELF OUT AS AUTHORITIES ON SUBJECT MATTER YOU DO NOT AND WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND

THANK YOU

NICE OPEN ACCESS
THERE ARE TWO STORIES

PROTAGONIST GOES OUT TO FIND ADVENTURE
2 ADVENTURE COMES FINDING PROTAGONIST

I STOPPED READING STUFF LIKE THAT IT'S REALLY JUST A QUESTION OF YOUR CHOSEN LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION AND ADDS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING USEFUL TO THE DEBATE
WHAT NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE MENTIONED YET IS THAT THE RESULTS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE DATA SET THEY PUT INTO IT

ITS NOT EVEN THAT THERE ARE ONLY SIX STORYLINES JUST THAT THEY ONLY FOUND SIX STORYLINES IN THE SET OF BOOKS THEY EXAMINED

I ARGUE THAT THERE ARE IN FACT MANY MORE STORYLINES ITS JUST THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON MANY OF THOSE STORYLINES WERE NOT FOUND TO BE POPULAR WITH READERS DIDNT SELL OR DIDNT MAKE IT INTO PRINTING



I AM IN A ROOM I AM CONTENTION

NOTHING IS HAPPENING

NOTHING IS HAPPENING

NOTHING IS HAPPENING

NOTHING IS HAPPENING

NOTHING IS HAPPENING

THE END

REAGAN AND COLLEAGUES THUS DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE ONLY SIX MAIN EMOTIONAL STORYLINES THESE INCLUDE RAGS TO RICHES SENTIMENT RISES RICHES TO RAGS FALL MAN IN A HOLE ICARUS CINDERELLA OEDIPUS

REALLY THAT'S THE EXTENT OF THE ANALYSIS

FIRST DISCOVERING THAT STORIES OFTEN ALTERNATE BETWEEN SUCCESSES AND FAILURES ISN'T THAT MUCH OF A FLASH OF GENIUS IT'S LIKE SAYING THAT STORIES ARE ONLY MADE UP OF TWO KINDS OF LETTERS CONSONANTS AND VOWELS TRUE YET MEANINGLESS

AND SECOND IT'S A VAST OVERSIMPLIFICATION WHAT USE IS IT TO TAKE A COMPLEX STORY SAY GAME OF THRONES OR LORD OF THE RINGS OR STAR WARS AND BOIL IT DOWN TO A BINARY PATTERN OF SUCCESSES AND FAILURES

NOW LET'S BE CLEAR THAT THE CAPABILITY OF THESE ALGORITHMS TO DETECT SUCCESS AND FAILURE FROM THE TEXT OF A NOVEL IS INTERESTING ALL ON ITS OWN BUT IT'S HARDLY THE LEAP OF INTUITIVENESS THAT THE AUTHORS OF THIS ARTICLE SUGGEST
THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE STORY IN FICTION OF HUMANITY VERSUS BRUTALITY
I WAS TAUGHT THAT THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY NODES THAT ARE THE VIRTUES DEADLY SINS

THE MOVEMENT BETWEEN THOSE NODES IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLOT AND CHARACTERS THE INTEREST IN EACH CHARACTER OR IDEA IN EACH OF THOSE NODES CREATES THE EMOTIONAL STORYLINES

ALL THIS COMBINATORICS IS HORSESHIT REDUCING IT TO GOING TOWARDS OR AWAY IS DUMB

SO YOU'VE GOT HUMILITY AND PRIDE ABSTINENCE AND GLUTTONY AND SO ON

THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT MOVING TOWARDS THE SIN IS FALL AND TOWARDS THE VIRTUE IS RISE

YOU COULD DO THIS INFINITELY A THOMAS PYNCHON NOVEL MIGHT HAVE MULTIPLE CHARACTERS ALL DOING SOME IN CHORUS SOME NOT FULLY ALIGNED AND SO ON

I FIND IT VASTLY MORE USEFUL TO REMOVE THE DIRECTIONALITY OUT OF THE EQUATION AND THINK OF IT IS TRAVELING TOWARDS AN EMOTION ITSELF


CLICKBAIT
I LOVE THE DRESDEN FILES F IT I REALLY LOVE CODEX ALEA AS WELL
I'M AN AVID READER AND WHILE HE SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR WRITING SOME OF THE BEST ACTION SCENES IN THE BUSINESS THAT IS NOT WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT HIS WRITINGS
WHILE I WILL START SELLING HIM TO MY FRIENDS BY TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE INSANE STUNTS ZOMBIE DROPPING SATELLITES FROM ORBIT AND THE GLORIOUS JOUTES THE BUILDING WAS ON FIRE AND IT WASN'T MY FAULT THE THING THAT REALLY IMPRESSES ME IS HIS ABILITY TO WRITE LET'S CALL IT LONG TERM
HOW HE KEEPS OVERARCHING PLOT LINES RELEVANT WITHOUT BEING ALL-CONSUMING
HOW SMALL THINGS IN WAY EARLIER BOOKS SUDDENLY IS HUUUUGE ISSUES NOW
HOW HIS CHARACTERS ACTUALLY DEVELOP AND ISN'T JUST IN SONE STASIS AND THEY HAVE DEPTH TO THEM

OH AND YEAH HE WRITES WOMEN REALLY WELL IMHO BUT HE SHOULD PROBABLY STAY AWAY FROM THE XD
I FOUND THE CODEX ALEA SERIES MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE RECENTLY PURCHASED THE WINDLASS TO TRY ALSO
JIM BUTCHER HAS DONE TWO AMAS HERE THE FIRST AMA THE SECOND AMA HERE'S A LINK TO ALL OF OUR UPCOMING AMAS

I AM A BOT AND THIS ACTION WAS PERFORMED AUTOMATICALLY PLEASE CONTACT THE MODERATORS OF THIS SUBREDDIT MESSAGE COMPOSE TO R BOOKS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS
I FIND THAT I'M GENERALLY IN THE MINORITY FOR PREFERRING HIS CODEX ALEA SERIES TO THE DRESDEN FILES DRESDEN NEVER REALLY GRABBED ME BUT ALEA DID AND HARD I FINISHED THE LAST THREE BOOKS OF THAT IN ONE WEEKEND

HIS LATEST THE WINDLASS ACTUALLY WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING TO ME IT WAS A GOOD BOOK BUT IT WASN'T A GREAT ONE AND COMING OFF OF THE HIGH OF THE ALEA SERIES IT DIDN'T QUITE STACK UP THOUGH IT COULD HAVE IT COULD HAVE USED LESS WATSON CHARACTERS AND A FEW MORE EDITING PASSES TO TIGHTEN THINGS UP AS IS IT WAS AN INTERESTING BOOK WITH A FUN WORLD AND SOME ENTERTAINING CHARACTERS BUT FELL AFOUL OF A FEW BLAND CHARACTERS AND IMO NOT USING THE WORLD ENOUGH

THE THING IS I REALLY DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS FAULT I SUSPECT THE PUBLISHER RUSHED IT OUT THE DOOR WITHOUT GIVING IT ENOUGH TIME TO BAKE I'LL DEFINITELY TRY THE SEQUEL WHEN IT HITS BUT I HOPE IT GETS A BIT MORE POLISH
FAN OF THE DRESDEN BOOKS I HAVEN'T READ ANY OF HIS OTHERS THOUGH
THE FIRST FEW BOOKS ARE WEAK THEY GET BETTER AFTER

THE WRITING IS NEVER SPECTACULAR BUT ITS BETTER THAN MOST OF SIMILAR SERIES IT MOSTLY SUCCEEDS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T GET IN HIS OWN WAY

WHAT REALLY SETS THE SERIES APART IS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS AND THE WAY HE SLOWLY DEVELOPS BIT PARTS INTO FULLY FLESHED OUT CHARACTERS WITH INTERESTING ARCS

DON'T EXPECT LITERARY GENIUS BUT THEY'RE FUN
DRESDEN FILES ARE MY FAVORITE BOOK SERIES HOWEVER WHEN HE STARTS DESCRIBING WOMEN'S BODIES IT GETS CREEPY AND THE SEX SCENES ARE AWKWARD AND USUALLY FORCED
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE DRESDEN FILES BOOKS THEY NEED A BIT OF TIME BUT IT'S WORTH THE TIME

BUTCHER WRITES CHARACTERS THAT I CAN REALLY GROW TO LOVE TO ME GETTING ATTACHED TO THEM IS A HUGE THING ABOUT THE SERIES AS WE SLOWLY GOT TO KNOW SO MANY OF THEM AS HARRY GOT MORE FRIENDS AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO DEPEND ON OTHERS MORE
HARRY HIMSELF HE IS A DISASTER THE MAN IS AWKWARD AS HELL ALWAYS ENDS UP MESSED UP BY SOMETHING HE KEEPS MAKING FUN OF HIS OWN PAIN
ALL IN ALL THEY REALLY FEEL LIKE A BUNCH WITH A SOUL AND TO ME THAT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY KIND OF ABSTRACT BIG THING THAT WOULD MAKE A BOOK ARTSY

I LIKE HIS WRITING STYLE BECAUSE I LIKE HARRY FIRST PERSON IS RISKY BECAUSE WHEN I HATE THE CHARACTER I WILL HATE THE BOOK HELLO YA BOOKS WITH WOLD SAVING TEEN GIRLS BLIGH IT'S ALL GOOD FUN AND RIDICULOUS ACTION AWESOME

I THINK PICKING UP RECOMMENDING MENTIONING ETC THIS SERIES IS GOING TO BE A SAFE BET FOR A LOOOONG TIME IT'S EASY TO GET INTO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THIS SUPER KNOWLEDGEABLE FANTASY FANATIC TO FEEL IS ACCESSIBLE

HIS OTHER BOOKS NOT READ YET BUT DEFINITELY DOING IT PROBABLY NEXT YEAR
FOR A BOOKS SERIES CODEX ALEA IS ONE OF THE BEST THOUGHT OUT EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER READ IT FEELS THAT BUTCHER KNEW FROM START HOW IT WILL ALL END AND IT TAKES AROUND BOOKS TO GET THE BIGGER PICTURE WHICH IS GREAT CHARACTERS ARE THOUGHT OUT NOT TOO MANY POBS AND THE WHOLE INTRIGUE PLOT PUTS MARTIN TO SHAME

I AM NOT INTO URBAN FANTASY SO I CANNOT COMMENT ON THE DRESDEN FILES BUT CODEX ALEA IS GREAT
THE DRESDEN BOOKS ARE WHAT I CONSIDER GREAT ACTION FANTASY FUN READS WITH GOOD STORYLINES THAT ARE SHORT ISH AND NOT TOO COMPLEX YOU CAN SEE HIS WRITING IMPROVE STEADILY AS THE STORY PROGRESSES I GLADLY SUGGEST THESE TO LOTS OF PEOPLE AS THEY'RE AN HONEST BLAST TO READ AND HIS WRITING STYLE IS FLUID AND SMOOTH

IF THERE IS ANY PARTICULAR PLACE HE COULD IMPROVE IT'S IN HIS PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN RELATIONSHIPS TOO OFTEN THOUGHTS AND INTERACTIONS READ TOO MUCH LIKE WHAT A TEENAGE NICE GUY WOULD THINK AND IT'S PRETTY CRINGEWORTHY AT TIMES OVERALL HE DOES OKAY BUT THERE ARE SOME BAD ONES SCATTERED ABOUT

AS FOR REMEMBERED I THINK HE'LL BE FINE HE REMINDS ME OF LOUIS AN AUTHOR WHO'S NOT NECESSARILY REMEMBERED AS PROFOUND BUT EVERYONE KNOWS WHO HE IS AND MOST PEOPLE HAVE READ HIM BECAUSE HE'S FUN AND ENTERTAINING
I LIKE JIM BUTCHER MAINLY BECAUSE I FIND THAT HIS WRITING IS EASY TO READ WELL CONSTRUCTED AND THAT HE IS A GOOD

I PERCEIVE HIM AS A WORKING AUTHOR MORE THAN A LITERARY VIRTUOSO BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I ENJOY IN PART ABOUT HIS STYLE IT'S CHARACTERISTICALLY UNCOMPLICATED READING THAT'S MEANT TO BE FUN AND ENJOYED FOR WHAT IT IS

HE IS TO DATE THE ONLY AUTHOR TO HAVE WRITTEN IN THE FIRST PERSON THAT I HAVE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED READING THAT MIGHT BE BECAUSE I LIKE HARRY DRESDEN A GREAT DEAL

I'M A HUGE DRESDEN FILES FAN BUT I LIKED THE CODEX ALEA AND THE WINDLASS AS WELL
GOOD IDEAS AND FUN ROMPS THAT CONTINUOUSLY SURPRISE ME BY WORKING WHEN THEY REALLY REALLY SHOULDN'T BUT HARDLY A STERLING WRITER
CODEX ALEA IS TOO YA FICTION FOR MY TASTE QUALITY OF DRESDEN FILES VARIES FROM OK TO GOOD
JIM IS A COMPETENT SOLID PROFESSIONAL WRITER HIS PLOTS ARE WELL CRAFTED HIS PROSE STYLE IS CLEAR AND EASY TO READ HE SELDOM GOES OFF INTO FLIGHTS OF POETIC FANCY BUT THAT'S NOT A BAD THING I LIKE THE WAY HE WRITES I CAN READ HIS NOVELS WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR MOST OF THE NOVELS OF HIS FELLOW GENRE WRITERS
I LOVE THE DRESDEN FILES LIKED THE CODEX SERIES AND ENJOYED CINDER SPIRES A FANTASTIC WORLD BUILDER

COME VISIT THE DRESDEN FILES SUBREDDIT AS YOU JOURNEY THROUGH THE SERIES A GREAT SUB FOR QUESTIONS AND SPECULATION
I REALLY LIKE THE DRESDEN FILES AND I DON'T USUALLY READ URBAN FANTASY
CONTINUE READING
NOOOOO GOODNESS IT'S PERFECTLY FINE TO USE COMPANION TEXTS ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE READING THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT BEFOREHAND IF YOU WERE READING SOLELY THE NO FEAR SURE THAT'D BE AN ISSUE BUT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH READING SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL TO SOMETHING YOU JUST READ
NO THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO READ LITERARY CRITICISM OR REVIEWS OF CLASSIC LITERATURE AS A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING THE WORKS BETTER WHILE NO FEAR BOOKS AREN'T EXACTLY THE SAME THE GOAL IS YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE THE IDEAS OF THE PLAYS BETTER SO YOU'RE USING A TOOL THAT MIGHT HELP

YOU MENTIONED YOU'RE STILL READING THE ORIGINAL TEXT AND SUPPLEMENTING IT WITH THE MODERN DAY ONE I BET AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PARSE AND UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINAL WITHOUT SO MUCH GUIDANCE AND EXPLANATION SO YOU'RE LIKELY LEARNING A SKILL IN THE PROCESS ALL OF THIS IS HARDLY LAZY IT'S ACTUALLY CAREFUL ATTENTION AND EFFORT
LOOK AT IT THAT WAY YOU READ AND YOU TRY LIKE HELL TO UNDERSTAND YOU ARE NOT A MORON
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SMALL PEOPLE WHO TRY TO MAKE OTHERS FEEL BAD FOR WHAT THEY LIKE THAT'S THEIR INSECURITIES DON'T MAKE THEM YOUR OWN SHAKESPEAREAN LANGUAGE ISN'T EASY BUT THE STORIES ARE FANTASTIC AND IF READING THE NO FEAR ALLOWS YOU TO ENJOY THEM THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS
A THE PLAYS ARE NOW HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD AND LANGUAGE CHANGES A LOT I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO JUST READ A SHAKESPEARE PLAY WITHOUT ANY TRANSLATION AIDS

B ANOTHER DIMENSION IS THAT THEY'RE PLAYS NOT NOVELS SO THEY'RE REALLY MEANT TO BE SEEN AND HEARD RATHER THAN READ THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T NEED SO MUCH HAND HOLDING AT AN ACTUAL PRODUCTION BECAUSE THE ACTORS ARE ALREADY DOING THAT FOR YOU
READ WHAT YOU LIKE

HOWEVER IF YOU ARE WORRIED THAT PERHAPS YOU AREN'T DOING YOUR DUE DILIGENCE IN EXPERIENCING THE WORDS OF SHAKESPEARE YOU CAN DO WHAT I HAVE DONE A FEW TIMES WHEN READING STUFF WRITTEN A LONG TIME AGO JUST BUY AN ANNOTATED VERSION

A GOOD ANNOTATED BOOK WILL LET YOU READ THE ORIGINAL FORMAT BUT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD DEAL OF THE BACKGROUND YOU NEED TO APPRECIATE IT AS SOMEONE WHO WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE WORK
NOT AT ALL IT'S A VERY USEFUL TOOL
ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE IS NEVER A BAD THING NO MATTER HOW IT'S GLEANED IF YOU'RE ENJOYING IT THEN KEEP IT UP
SOMEONE ELSE SAID IT BUT IT IS WORTH REPEATING YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT LAZY YOU'RE PUTTING IN TIME WORKING AT SOMETHING THAT ISN'T EASY FOR YOU YOU DIDN'T QUIT YOU FOUND A TOOL KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND YOU'LL NAIL THIS

IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'VE MANAGED TO SEE SOME LIVE PERFORMANCES IT CAN BE A HOWEVER SO I'D LIKE TO RECOMMEND A FEW MOVIES WHEN YOU GET TO MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING SEE THE KENNETH BRANAGH VERSION FIRST IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST VEHICLE OUT THERE FOR GETTING PEOPLE OVER THE HUMP WITH THE LANGUAGE AND SEEING HOW ACCESSIBLE IT CAN BE ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT THEN SEEK OUT THE JOSS WHEDON FILM FROM A FEW YEARS AGO IT'S SORT OF MUCH ADO NOIR
I TOTALLY RED MORMON INSTEAD OF MORON AND I WAS SUPREMELY CONFUSED
IF YOU ENJOY IT MORE READING NO FEAR SHAKESPEARE DO THAT WHO CARES IF SOMEONE ELSE DOESN'T LIKE IT IT'S NOT HURTING ANYONE I'M SURE SOME PEOPLE LOOK DOWN ON MY CHOICE TO READ CHEESY DETECTIVE NOVELS MORE OFTEN THAN GREAT LITERATURE BUT I ENJOY THEM SO I'LL CONTINUE AND SO SHOULD YOU


LAW
GUIDE TO SHAKESPEARE IS A GREAT READ TO UNDERSTANDING SHAKESPEARE IT'S ALSO FREE ON THE INTERNET
DEFINITELY NOT I THINK IF YOU READ A MODERN TRANSLATION BY ITSELF THEN THAT IS POINTLESS BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE OF SHAKESPEARE IS THE MOST APPEALING ASPECT OF HIS WRITING HOWEVER THERE'S NOTHING AT ALL WRONG OR EMBARRASSING ABOUT USING A SIDE-BY-SIDE VERSION TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND IT
DEPENDS ON IN YOU ASK MY OLD ENGLISH MRS STEVENS USING NO FEAR SHAKESPEARE IS NOT CHEATING I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MATERIAL BETTER SO THAT I CAN MAKE A WONDERFUL PRESENTATION
SHOULD I CONTINUE READING OR DOES DOING SO SERVE AS A MARK THAT I'M NOT A VERY INTELLIGENT READER

YOU SHOULD CONTINUE READING WITH BOTH AND IT DOES SERVE AS A MARK THAT YOU'RE NOT A VERY INTELLIGENT READER

WHAT

HOLD ON NOW I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE AN UN INTELLIGENT SHAKESPEARE READER YOU'RE JUST NOT A VERY INTELLIGENT ONE YET THERE IS A GREAT CHANCE THAT YOU ARE ON THE ROAD TO BECOMING A VERY INTELLIGENT ONE NO FEAR SHAKESPEARE NFS IS ONE TOOL IN THAT JOURNEY

BUT I ALSO STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU INCREASINGLY TRY TO NOT USE THE NFS HELPERS EVERY TIME SOMETIMES MAKE A POINT TO STRUGGLE WITH THE LANGUAGE READ THE SAME SMALL PIECE OVER AND OVER AS MANY AS TIMES IT'S WORTH IT TRY TO WORK OUT THE MUSCLES THAT PARSE LANGUAGE AND GET INSIDE HOW MIND WORKED TO THE DEGREE THAT ANY OF US MORTALS CAN BY DOING THIS I THINK YOU WILL START TO SEE PATTERNS HOW HE PUTS VERBS IN PLACES YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT HIS QUIETUS MAKE INSTEAD OF MAKE HIS QUIETUS OR HOW YOU OFTEN HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO THE SUBJECT OF A THOUGHT IS ETC SOME OF THE VOCABULARY JUST PLAIN NEEDS TO BE LOOKED UP OF COURSE BUT THE POINT IS TO PUT IN THE STRUGGLE AND THEREBY INCREASE YOUR ABILITY TO READ WITHOUT HELP




YES JUST KIDDING NUMBER IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING I'VE READ THEM TOO I'VE READ THE ORIGINAL PLAYS BUT THE COMICS ARE ENJOYABLE AS WELL
I AGREE WITH WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID YOU'RE REALLY PUTTING IN AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE SHAKESPEARE

MY ADVICE ON BORROWING OR BUYING AN EDITION OF SHAKESPEARE IS GET ONE THAT HAS AT LEAST FOUR OR FIVE FOOTNOTES AT THE BOTTOM OF EACH PAGE I'D BE COMPLETELY LOST WITHOUT THOSE FOOTNOTES EXPLAINING A WORD THAT WE NO LONGER USE IN ENGLISH OR A WORD WHOSE MEANING HAS CHANGED

ONE OF MY FAVORITE FOOT NOTES COMES IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY FROM HAMLET THE ALLUSION IS LOST THIS MEANS THAT A CHARACTER WAS MAKING A REFERENCE TO SOME WELL KNOWN STORY IN TIME BUT IT'S COMPLETELY UNKNOWN NOW SO WE CAN'T FULLY EXPLAIN WHAT THE CHARACTER WAS TALKING ABOUT

ALSO WHEN WATCHING SHAKESPEARE ON FILM AT HOME IF YOU CAN PUT ON THE SUBTITLES I'VE BEEN READING AND WATCHING SHAKESPEARE FOR YEARS AND STILL DO THIS

EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS IN FURTHERING YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND IF YOU KEEP IT UP EVENTUALLY YOU WILL GAIN SOME FLUENCY IN READING HEARING SHAKESPEARE
YOU'VE FOUND A TOOL TO HELP YOU ENJOY WHAT YOU'RE READING MORE AND TO GET MORE OUT OF IT I SAY USE IT AND ENJOY ANYONE WHO HARSHEN ON YOUR MELLOW FOR TRYING TO LEARN CAN TAKE A FLYING LEAP AND IF I CAN MAKE A RECOMMENDATION FIND A COPY OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE ABRIDGED ON DVD ON THE YOUTUBES JUST TRUST ME
DUDE NUMBER NO ONE WRITES OR SPEAKS LIKE SHAKESPEARE ANYMORE SO THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU TO MAGICALLY KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET WHAT HE'S SAYING WITHOUT BEING TAUGHT FIRST YOU'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY IT'S FINE IF YOU DON'T GET THE LANGUAGE FOR A WHILE I HAVE A NO FEAR COPY OF MACBETH AND I LOVE IT THERE ARE SO MANY IMPLICATIONS AND CULTURAL REFERENCES YOU MISS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPANION IT ENRICHES YOUR READING EXPERIENCE HAVE NO SHAME
I AM AN AVID READER AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO READ BEOWULF AND CANTERBURY TALES WITHOUT MUSH HELP BUT I PREFER TO READ THE NO FEAR SHAKESPEARE IT HELPS TO TRANSLATE IT INTO A MORE MODERN WAY AND I WAS ALWAYS ABLE TO PASS THAT SECTION OF CLASS WITH FLYING COLORS BECAUSE OF THEM SO NO YOU ARE NOT A MORON FOR READING NO FEAR IF THAT IS WHAT ALLOWS YOU TO ENJOY AND UNDERSTAND SHAKESPEARE THEN SO BE IT
COMPANION TEXTS TRANSLATIONS ARE FINE BUT YOU MUST READ THE ORIGINAL AS WELL I PERSONALLY PREFER USING A NOTED VERSION OF THE BOOK EAST G FOLGER SHAKESPEARE LIBRARY THAT GIVES DEFINITIONS TO ARCHAIC LANGUAGE INSIGHT INTO OBSCURE REFERENCES THIS ALLOWS YOU TO READ THE ORIGINAL TEXT WITH SOME HELP
IF I GOT A WORD EVERY TIME THIS STORY GETS POSTED I'D HAVE A SHORT STORY BY NOW
I LOVE THIS THIS IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT IT'S PRINTED ON RECEIPT PAPER
ALMOST MAKES ME WISH I HAD A PUBLIC TRANSIT COMMUTE
THAT SUCKS BUT IF READING ISN'T IMPORTANT TO YOUR FAMILY THEN I CAN SEE HOW THEY MIGHT NOT THINK IT'S A BIG DEAL GOTTA SAY I CAN'T REALLY IMAGINE A HOUSE SO SMALL THAT THE ONLY PLACE TO KEEP PRECIOUS BOOKS OLD AUTOGRAPHED MUCH LOVED IS IN A BOX NEAR THE FRONT DOOR WHY NOT UNDER YOUR BED
I ASKED MY DAD ABOUT THIS AND HE SAID I THOUGHT YOU KNEW WE WERE USING THAT AS A TRASH CAN AND THEN TOLD ME THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GARAGE NOT IN THE HOUSE

THAT RIGHT THERE IS BULLSHIT NOT ONLY ARE YOUR FEELINGS GETTING DISMISSED YOU ARE BEING BLAMED FOR WHAT HAPPENED

THE RIGHT THING TO DO WOULD BE TO COMMISERATE AND TO APOLOGIZE EVEN IF HE DIDN'T MEAN TO DESTROY YOUR BOOKS
YOU COULD ASK FOR REPLACEMENTS OF SOME OF YOUR FAVORITES FOR CHRISTMAS I KNOW YOU HAVE MEMORIES WITH THE BOOKS BUT IF YOU BUY THEM AGAIN AND READ THEM AGAIN YOU'LL MAKE NEW MEMORIES WITH THE NEW BOOKS AND IT'LL BE A BIT BETTER THAN JUST GETTING THEM ON YOUR NOOK BOOKS IS A WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN GET A TON OF USED BOOKS FOR CHEAP I RECENTLY GOT LIKE GREAT BOOKS FOR FROM THERE
REMOVED
I HONESTLY DON'T GET IT YOU WERE STORING THEM THERE FOREVER BUT THEY ONLY JUST STARTED USING IT AS A TRASH CAN AM I MISSING SOMETHING
I'M SORRY MANUAL THAT'S BULLSHIT AND ALL THESE COMMENTS SAYING IT WAS YOUR FAULT CAN'T BE HELPING DID YOUR FAMILY NOT SEE ALL THE FUCKING BOOKS IN THE BOX BEFORE THEY THREW GARBAGE IN THERE IT'S THEIR FAULT AND THAT'S SHITTY OF THEM TO DO I'D BE DEVASTATED IF I LOST MY BOOKS LIKE THAT

THE STORIES ARE STILL WITH YOU EVEN IF YOUR FIRST COPIES OF THEM AREN'T READABLE ANYMORE TAKE COMFORT IN THAT HOW THEY IMPACTED YOU HAS NOT BEEN AND CANNOT BE TAKEN AWAY PLUS YOU CAN ALWAYS GET ANOTHER COPY OF EACH AND YOU CAN MAKE MORE MEMORIES WITH THEM AND BEAT THEM UP TWICE AS MUCH AS THOSE FIRST ONES I KNOW THEY WON'T BE THE SAME BUT MAYBE IT CAN STILL BE GOOD
I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT THE LOSS OF BOOKS I DON'T DO A WHOLE LOT OF READING THESE DAYS BUT I ENJOY BOOKS TOO AND I AM SAD TO HEAR YOUR COLLECTION IS DESTROYED IT WOULD PISS ME OFF TO KNOW MY FAMILY HAD BEEN DUMPING TRASH IN MY BOOK BOX HOW COULD THEY HAVE POSSIBLY MIXED THAT UP
SUCKS YOU MIGHT FIND SUITABLE REPLACEMENTS ON EBAY
UM IT'S MOSTLY YOUR FAULT YOU SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED IT TO YOUR FAMILY THAT THE BOX IS YOUR BOOKS AND NOT GARBAGE YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD THE BOX IN YOUR ROOM IF IT MEANT SO MUCH TO YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE CHECKED THE BOX MORE OFTEN

ANYTHING OF MINE THAT I DIDN'T WANT DESTROYED I'VE HIDDEN FROM MY BROTHERS AND MY FAMILY NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OR TO YOUR THINGS EXCEPT YOU AND NO ONE SPACE SHOULD BE INVADED TO HAVE YOUR THINGS IN IT

SORRY
YOU HAVE TO GO IN KNOWING IT WAS A FIRST DRAFT OF KAM AND IS NOT THE SAME STORY AT ALL I READ IT AND WHEN I FINISHED I THOUGHT YEP THIS NEEDED A GOOD EDITOR GLAD SHE GOT ONE OR WE WOULDN'T HAVE KAM WHICH IS SUCH A GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL BOOK
I DID READ IT WHEN IT CAME OUT IT WAS MEDIOCRE BASICALLY IT'S AN EARLY DRAFT OF KAM AND THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE TO GAW TO MAKE IT INTO KAM WERE FOR THE BETTER
IT'S TRASH IT WAS A MANUSCRIPT FOR A REJECTED NOVEL THAT A SERIOUSLY ILL AND POSSIBLY DELUSIONAL LEE WAS FORCED TO PUBLISH AS A CASH GRAB BY HER FAMILY PUBLISHER BEFORE SHE DIED WHICH SHE DID SHORTLY AFTER ITS RELEASE
IT WAS LEFT UNRELEASED FOR ALL THESE YEARS WITH GOOD REASON THE BOOK IS IN MOST MEANINGFUL WAYS UNFINISHED THIS WAS THE RAW MATERIAL FOR KAM AND NOTHING MORE

THIS BOOK SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED


SIMILAR TO WHEN FANBOYS LOSE THEIR MINDS FOR CUT FOOTAGE AND EXTENDED EDITIONS OF THE TIME THIS STUFF WOUND UP ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR FOR A REASON GAW IS A DRAFT THAT WAS REWRITTEN FOR A REASON IT'S PART OF THE AUTHOR'S PROCESS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BEST LEFT IN HER PRIVATE PAPERS AS A WASTE PRODUCT THAT MADE KAM POSSIBLE
GO SET A WATCHMAN IS STILL A VERY GOOD BOOK AND WORTH A READ PEOPLE TEND TO COMPARE IT TO TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD AND SAY GO SET A WATCHMAN IS MEDICARE ITS HARD AND UNFAIR TO COMPARE THE BOOK TO TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD AS IT IS ALMOST FLAWLESS

IT WONT RUIN HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD IF ANYTHING IT WILL MAKE YOU APPRECIATE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE AS WELL THE BOOK WILL LET YOU CARRY ON WITH THE CHARACTERS LATER IN LIFE ITS A WIN WIN IN MY OPINION
I HONESTLY THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING EVEN THOUGH YES IT ISN'T AS NOTEWORTHY AS KAM BUT IT'S A GOOD READ AND DEFINITELY WORTH PICKING UP EVEN IF IT IS JUST TO SEE WHAT A DRAFT OF KAM IS LIKE YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW THIS STORY IS DIFFERENT AND IT'S A LITTLE DARKER PHILOSOPHICALLY IF YOU'RE AGAINST READING IT BC OF THE ATTICUS SITUATION THEN IMO YOU JUST SHOULDN'T BE READING BOOKS I HAD A HIGHSCHOOL TEACHER WHO REFUSED TO EVEN TRY TO START IT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HER IDOL ATTICUS BE TARNISHED BUT ULTIMATELY THAT'S THE POINT OF THE BOOK WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR MORAL IDOL IS RIPPED OF HIS ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SOMEONE YOU'RE CONNECTED TO BY BLOOD

IT WON'T RUIN YOUR OPINION OF KAM THAT'S LIKE SAYING YOU HATE THE GOD FATHER BECAUSE PART SUCKS JUST DOESN'T REALLY HAPPEN UNLESS YOUR ARE EXTREMELY IMPRESSIONABLE


DDK I LIKED IT WORTH A SHOT SOME REALLY INTERESTING SCENES BUT DOES FEEL INCOMPLETE OR RUSHED IN SOME PARTS
YES AND I AM STILL TRYING TO GET THE RANCID TASTE OF BETRAYAL OUT OF MY PORES
I WROTE A DETAILED READING JOURNAL OF IT HERE THE NOVEL IS WORTH A LOOK AS AN EARLY WORKING THROUGH OF IDEAS IN KAM IT ISN'T AS GOOD IT DOESN'T SUCCEED IN A DRAMATIC WAY LIKE KAM AND IS MORE FOCUSED ON A WHITE WOMAN'S LEARNING EXPERIENCES THAN ON THE INJUSTICES OR OTHERWISE OF THE TREATMENT OF BLACKS IN THE SOUTHERN

EDIT TYPO

I LOVED KAM NOT SO IMPRESSED WITH GAW I'M UNSURE IF IT'S JUST BECAUSE TO ME AT LEAST THE STORY REALLY ISN'T AS GOOD OR IF IT WAS JUST HYPED UP SO MUCH BY THE MEDIA THAT I WAS EXPECTING MORE

AFTER READING AND HAVING TIME TO DIGEST WHAT I HAD JUST READ WITHOUT MY CONSTANTLY TELLING ME I WAS WASTING MY TIME WITH IT AND IT WAS JUST A BASED ON THE OPINIONS OF HIS EXTREMELY PRETENTIOUS FRIENDS WHO HADN'T EVEN READ IT BUT WHATEVER I THINK THERE ARE SOME LESSONS THAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM GAW I'M CONSIDERING A MORE THOROUGH REREAD OF BOTH NOVELS NOW THAT I'M IN A BETTER PLACE WHERE I CAN READ WHAT I WANT WITHOUT CONSTANT JUDGEMENT
I LATE S FEMALE WAS HOSTING A BOOK GROUP AT A WOMEN'S SENIOR HOUSING COMPLEX AND NONE OF US WERE TOO IMPRESSED WITH THE STORY WE ALL AGREED THAT KAM WAS THE BETTER STORY AND WE WISHED THAT THERE WASN'T SO MUCH MEDIA ATTENTION ABOUT GAW TO PEAK OUR INTEREST IN THE TITLE
I FEEL LIKE HARPER LEE WAS UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE SAME WRITING STYLE THAT LENT SO MUCH CHARM TO KAM
I TOO ADORE KAM IT IS MY FAVORITE BOOK I HAD A HARD TIME WITH GAW IT IS NOT AS GOOD PERIOD TRYING TO AVOID ANY SPOILERS IT TAINTED SOME OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE LITERARY CHARACTERS AND THERE WAS A CHARACTER DEATH THAT WAS HANDLED SO FLIPPANTLY IT BROKE MY HEART I SO DESPERATELY WANTED A SECOND KAM BUT GAW JUST IS NOT THAT
NUMBER I'D LIKE TO GET THE HARDCOVER BOSSET BUT KNOWING THAT GAW IS BASICALLY A FIRST DRAFT OF MOCKINGBIRD IS MAKING ME STEER CLEAR AND KAM IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS OF ALL TIME

WILL WAIT AND GET IT AT A THRIFT STORE BEFORE CHECKING IT OUT
IT'S JUST NOT AS GOOD THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO SAY
LOVED KAM I REFUSE TO READ A BOOK WHICH WILL RECON ATTICUS FINCH INTO AN ANTI HERO I ALSO REFUSE TO PUMP MONEY INTO A GREEDY LAWYERS PUBLISHERS ACCOUNTS FOR AN UNFINISHED UNNECESSARY BOOK
IT'S BETTER THAN HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD IF YOU OWN IT YOU MIGHT AS WELL READ IT MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE IT MAKES ATTICUS FINCH LOOK BAD BUT IN A WAY THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT AND IT DOES WELL ATTICUS FINCH IS SO WORSHIPPED SO PERFECT NO ONE WANTS TO SEE HIM IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT BUT THE POINT IS YOU CAN'T GO AROUND WORSHIPPING ATTICUS FINCH YOU'VE GOT TO GROW UP AND BE YOUR OWN PERSON IT DOESN'T RUIN TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD JUST TELLS A BIT OF A DIFFERENT STORY
I'M NOT TRAPPED IN HERE WITH HARPER LEE SHE'S TRAPPED IN HERE WITH ME
WHY ON EARTH WOULD IT CHANGE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT KAM THAT'S SILLY AS HELL GO SET A WATCHMAN IS NOT GOOD BUT LETTING IT SOUR YOU ON KAM MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL WHY DO THAT TO YOURSELF
IF YOU LIKE ATTICUS FINCH DON'T READ GO SET A WATCHMAN

GO SET A WATCHMAN IS KIND OF BORING THERE'S REALLY NOTHING HAPPENING UNTIL THE END THEN IN THE END IT TELLS THE MOTIVE OF WHY ATTICUS DEFENDED THE GUY IN MOCKINGBIRD HINT IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE RESPECTED THE GUY OR EMPATHIZED WITH THE TREATMENT OF BLACKS IN THE SOUTHERN IT WAS JUST BECAUSE HE WAS DEFENDING AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF A FALSE ACCUSATION

LEAVE IT AT THAT DON'T READ IT I NOW HATE ATTICUS FINCH
I LIKED IT IT WASN'T KAM BY ANY STRETCH BUT CONSIDERED AS A FIRST DRAFT IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HARPER LEE DEVELOPED THE CHARACTERS INTO WHAT THEY BECAME IN KAM FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH IT DIDN'T RUIN MY FEELINGS ABOUT KAM BUT GAVE ME A DEEPER APPRECIATION FOR THOSE CHARACTERS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THE CHARACTER OF ATTICUS IN GAW ADDED TO MY APPRECIATION OF HIM IN KAM
NORMALLY REQUESTS ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT SHOULD I READ OR WHAT AUTHORS BOOKS ARE SIMILAR TO SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO OUR WEEKLY RECOMMENDATION THREAD

HOWEVER SINCE THIS POST IS ALSO ASKING ABOUT THE CORRECT READING ORDER FOR WORKS I THINK IT OFFERS ENOUGH ROOM FOR DISCUSSION TO BE FINE HERE

I'M READING SOME OF WORK IN THE SAME MANNER YOU WIKISOURCE FOLLOWING THE ORDER OF A BOOK INDEX I'D SAY IT'S WORKING FINE FOR ME I WILL SAY ABOUT WORK THAT I DOUBT THE ORDER MATTERS A GREAT DEAL ANYMORE SINCE HE WROTE SO LONG AGO AND BECAME SO WELL-KNOWN MOST OF THE TROPES AND IDEAS WHICH WERE NOVEL AT THE TIME MAY NOW SEEM STALE OR COMMONPLACE SO THE BENEFIT GAINED FROM READING IN A PARTICULAR ORDER HAS PROBABLY BEEN NULLIFIED BY THE FACT THAT YOU'VE LIKELY BEEN EXPOSED TO COMING NEXT ANYWAY
MOST OF THEM ARE JUST SHORT STORIES SO IT DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH THE READING ORDER OTHERWISE I WOULD STONILY RECOMMEND LISTENING TO THE HP HOVERCRAFT LITERARY PODCAST THEY COVERED OFF ALL HIS WORK SO YOU CAN PROBABLY GLEAN A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA ALONG WITH YOUR READINGS AND THEY THEN MOVE ON TO OTHER AUTHORS WHO ARE SIMILAR OR INFLUENCED HOVERCRAFT
HOVERCRAFT IS A GOOD JOURNEY TO BE ON ENJOY IT EVERYONE ALREADY COVERED THE LACK OF READING ORDER NECESSITY SO I WILL JUST SUGGEST YOU READ THE KING IN YELLOW BY ROBERT WEST CHAMBERS IT'S FOUR STORIES THAT RELATE TO THE KING IN YELLOW WHO HOVERCRAFT TIED INTO THE GREAT OLD ONES MYTHOS SUPER SUPER FUN READ I THINK I ENJOY IT MORE SO THAN MOST HOVERCRAFT
I AGREE THAT ORDER ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT BUT I WOULD SUGGEST READING THEM IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE WRITTEN RATHER THAN PUBLISHED WORKS TEND TO REFERENCE HIS OTHER STORIES A LOT AND I THINK READING THEM IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER CAN FLESH OUT THE WORLD-BUILDING A BIT
AND FOR SIMILAR STORIES THE HORLA BY GUY DE MAUPASSANT

I'D RECOMMEND ALGERNON BLACKWOOD THERE'S A COLLECTION ANCIENT SORCERIES AND OTHER WEIRD STORES THAT'S REALLY GOOD H PAGE HOVERCRAFT IS EVEN QUOTED PRAISING HIM ON THE BACK COVER HE WAS QUITE FOND OF HIS STORY THE WILLOWS WHICH IS MOST DEFINITELY ONE OF THE GREATEST HORROR STORIES EVER WRITTEN

THOMAS LIGETTI IS ALSO GREAT THERE'S ALSO A COLLECTION OF HIS FIRST TWO BOOKS SONGS OF A DEAD DREAMER AND GRIMSCRIBE

SOMETHING EVEN MORE RECENT IS JEFF SOUTHERN REACH TRILOGY THE FIRST BOOK IN PARTICULAR ANNIHILATION FEELS EXACTLY LIKE SOMETHING HOVERCRAFT WOULD HAVE WROTE IF HE WAS AROUND TODAY

AND IF YOU WANT SOMETHING WAY MORE LEFT FIELD BUT STILL LARGELY INFLUENCED BY HOVERCRAFT AND THE OCCULT ROGER A NIGHT IN THE LONESOME OCTOBER IS FANTASTIC ALTHOUGH I'D SAVE IT FOR NEXT YEAR
I DON'T THINK IN THIS CASE THAT READING IN PUBLICATION ORDER IS THE BEST IDEA HIS EARLY CAREER IS NOT WHAT HE IS MOST REMEMBERED FOR IT WOULD BE A LOT OF COMMITMENT TO WADE THROUGH ALL THE EARLY STORIES BEFORE GETTING TO THE MAIN ONES THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY WORSE BUT THEY ARE TO SOME EXTENT PROTOTYPES FOR HIS MORE DEVELOPED STORIES AND THERE IS NO REAL ONGOING CONTINUITY TO WORRY ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE DAGON IS LIKE AN EARLY VERSION OF THE CALL OF CTHULU

SINCE I DON'T WANT TO JUST SAY THAT WITHOUT LEAVING A SUGGESTION PERHAPS TRY THIS PENGUIN PUBLISHED HIS COMPLETE STORIES IN THREE OMNIBUS VOLUMES EDITED BY A HOVERCRAFT EXPERT YOU COULD READ THEM IN THE ORDER FOUND THERE WHICH I BELIEVE WAS CHOSEN TO COVER HIS CAREER WITH SOME SORT OF LOGIC OR THEMES AND MIXES TOGETHER STORIES OF VARIOUS LENGTHS AND POINTS IN HIS CAREER
HOVERCRAFTS STORIES ARE INDIVIDUAL AND THEREFORE HAVE NO READING ORDER I HAVE A COPY OF HIS COMPLETE WORKS ORGANIZED BY PUBLICATION DATE BUT REALLY THE ONLY THING YOU GAIN FROM THIS IS A SENSE OF HIS DEVELOPING WRITING STYLE MY RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE TO READ HIS CLASSICS FIRST MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS CALL OF CTHULU UNWITCH HORROR AND IF YOU CRAVE MORE LOOK INTO HIS LESS WELL KNOWN STORIES
I JUST BOUGHT A BOOK YESTERDAY THAT'D BE PERFECT FOR YOU BECAUSE IT WAS PERFECT FOR ME IT'S CALLED HP HOVERCRAFT SELECTS AND IT'S ALL STORIES HP WROTE ABOUT IN ESSAYS AND AUTHORS WHO HE ADMIRED THE STORIES ARE PRETTY GOOD AND ALOT OF THEM ARE FROM THE AND ARE GOTHIC
THERE'S A GOOD COLLECTION OF HIS EARLY WORKS
THE ROAD TO MADNESS IT'S A LOT OF HIS EARLY STUFF AND ENDS WITH AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS SOME OF THE STUFF IS GREAT OTHERS YOU CAN TELL IT'S HIS EARLY WORK BUT OVERALL IT'S COOL TO SEE HOW HE PROGRESSED

EDIT I SHOULD MENTION IT DOESN'T INCLUDE A LOT FROM HIS MYTHOLOGY THERE'S A FEW HINTS AT CTHULHU IN WORKS LIKE THE TEMPLE BUT MOSTLY IT'S JUST GENERAL HORROR WRITING I ENJOYED IT A LOT ACTUALLY
I READ STORIES IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER AT FIRST I PICKED UP ANY COLLECTION I HAPPENED TO SEE HIM IN FOR A WHILE THEN WHEN I GOT MORE ENGROSSED AND DECIDED TO READ THE COMPLETE FICTION I READ IN PUBLICATION ORDER I DIDN'T FEEL THERE WAS A HUGE GAP IN THE EARLY AND LATE STORIES THOUGH THEY ARE DIFFERENT

A CHEAP IF YOU'RE INTO THAT OMNIBUS IS FROM B N WEATHERBOUND CLASSICS IT HAS THE STORIES IN ROUGH ORDER OF APPEARANCE I BELIEVE HAVE GIFTED THIS MANY TIMES AND ALWAYS HAD IT PRAISED THE STOCK AND PRINTING ARE VERY GOOD TOO JOSHI EVEN NOTATED THE STORIES IN A SMALL BLURB BEFORE THE TEXT SO YOU CAN SORT OF SCREEN STORIES FOR WHAT SUBJECT MATTER OR MYTHOS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN

ALL IN ALL THOUGH I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REPLIES ASIDE FROM A FEW CONNECTED STORIES THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU READ REALLY SHOULDN'T IMPACT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OR ENJOYMENT
LISTENING TO ROBERT E HORROR STORIES GOOD FRIENDS WITH HOVERCRAFT AND COPIED HIS STYLE MENTIONS HIM BY NAME IN ONE OF HIS STORIES ALONG WITH POE AND MACHEN IF YOU'RE WANTING TO STAY IN THE SAME VEIN AS HOVERCRAFT I SHOULD ALSO MENTION AUGUST DERLETH HE'S THE REASON YOU'RE READING THE STORIES THAT YOU ARE ALSO CLARK ASHTON SMITH AND ROBERT BLOCK WERE IN HIS CIRCLE OF INFLUENCE
STEPHEN NOUN IS INSPIRED BY ANOTHER STORY THE GREAT GOD PAN BUT STILL CONTAINING THE SAME ELEMENTS AS HOVERCRAFT FOR ME IT'S ONE OF HIS EXTREMELY CREEPY AND UNSETTLING STORIES

THERE'S ALSO GOOD WEB MOVIE SERIES ADAPTATION OF IT ON YOUTUBE
THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE OVERWHELMING BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT IF YOU WANT TO DIG A LITTLE BIT AND DISCOVER SOME LESSER KNOWN AUTHORS

IT'S A LIST OF ALL THE WRITERS WHOSE STORIES LIKE HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED ON WEIRD TALES A PULP MAG YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF WITH A LOT OF WELL WEIRD TALES AND OCCULT FICTION


I'VE READ EVERY HOVERCRAFT STORY AND I CAN SAY THERE IS NO RIGHT ORDER THE OVERLYING MYTHOS IS THE SAME BUT NOTHING EVER DIRECTLY RELATES REALLY TO ANYTHING ELSE WHEN I REREAD HIS WORK I OFTEN JUST GO TO WHICHEVER STORY STRIKES MY FANCY HOWEVER I WOULD SAVE HIS REVISION STORIES THOSE HE COLLABORATED ON WITH OTHE AUTHORS FOR AFTER YOU'VE FINISHED HIS MAIN WORK

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU USE BUT THERE IS A FREE PUBLIC DOMAIN COMPILATION OF ALL OF HIS STORIES NO POEMS OR REVISIONS AND THAT SHOULD HAVE THEM IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER JUST READING A BEST OF IS GREAT TOO IF YOU JUST WANT TO START WITH HIS MOST WELL KNOWN STUFF

ALSO TRY SOME OF HIS CIRCLE AS WELL FRANK BELKNAP LONG CLARK ASHTON SMITH AUGUST DERLETH ETC AND FROM MORE RECENT YEARS THOMAS LIGETTI WHOM IS ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES AMAZON HAS MANY CTHULHU MYTHOS COLLECTIONS VERY CHEAP AS WELL

EDIT SORRY IF THIS POSTED TWICE MY PHONE JUST WIGGED OUT LOL
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY SPECIAL GROUPS THAT STAY ON TOP OF ERGODIC LIT YOU PROBABLY JUST HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF PUBLISHING IN GENERAL OR CREATE YOUR OWN GROUP

THAT SAID I HAVE TWO MORE BOOKS TO ADD TO YOUR LIST THERE'S HOPSCOTCH BY JULIO CORTAZAR WHICH YOU CAN EITHER READ OR YOU CAN READ THEM IN THE VERY CHAOTIC ORDER LISTED ON THE FIRST PAGE AND THEN THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZAR TAKES THIS IDEA TO ITS NATURAL EXTREME WHERE YOU CAN READ THE CHAPTERS IN LITERALLY ANY ORDER YOU PLEASE UNFORTUNATELY CORTAZAR AND LAVIC ARE BOTH DEAD SO YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH WHATEVER THEY'RE UP TO
I TOO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THIS

AS FOR OTHER BOOKS I CAN ONLY THINK OF A FEW OFF HAND THE RAW SHARK TEXTS BY STEVEN HALL IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A BIT OF THIS KIND OF PLAY IN IT PALE FIRE BY NABOKOV IS ANOTHER NOX BY ANNE CARSON IS ANOTHER AND SINCE YOUR ALREADY READING HOL I ASSUME YOUR AWARE THAT HIS OTHER BOOKS ALL ALSO INCORPORATE THIS KIND OF THING
WITH ANY LUCK SOME OF THAT WAS HELPFUL
FINNEGAN WAKE

A MONOLITHIC PUZZLEBOX THAT YOU CAN ENJOY UNTIL THE END OF TIME
I DON'T REMEMBER ANY OFFER OF PRIZES IN GEB THE ONE PROBLEM OFFERED TO THE READER AT THE BEGINNING THE MU PUZZLE IS REVEALED TO HAVE NO ANSWER
THIS MIGHT NOT BE QUITE RIGHT AS IT'S A PICTURE BOOK BUT THERE WAS A CONTEST EMBEDDED IN A BOOK CALLED MASQUERADE WHICH LEAD TO AN EXPENSIVE PRIZE A RABBIT HARE MADE OF PRECIOUS GEMS AND METALS FOR WHOEVER COULD SOLVE THE PUZZLES FIRST ENDED IN SCANDAL
WIKI MASQUERADE BOOK
THERE ARE CERTAINLY COLLEGE COURSES ON THE BIBLE AS LITERATURE YOU MIGHT CHECK YOUR LOCAL SCHOOLS AND SEE WHAT TEXTS OR OTHER SUPPORTING MATERIALS THEY USE OR MAYBE EVEN SIGN UP FOR A COURSE IF IT'S OFFERED ONLINE OR THROUGH OPEN UNIVERSITY OR THE LIKE
TRUE STORY IN THE DAYS WHEN IT WAS ROUTINE FOR STUDENTS TO TRAVEL AROUND BY I GOT TALKING TO THE DRIVER WHO HAD JUST OFFERED ME A LIFT I TOLD HIM I WAS STUDYING FOR AN ENGLISH LITERATURE DEGREE HE PAUSED THEN SAW AN OPENING WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE BIBLE HE ASKED ME AS LITERATURE

HE WAS A WITNESS AND IT WAS ONE OF THE LONGEST TRIPS I CAN EVER REMEMBER
THE GREAT CODE AND WORDS WITH POWER BY NORTHROP FRYE
YOU CAN CHECK OUT MODERN CRITICAL VIEWS THE BIBLE

SOME LIBRARIES MAY HAVE A SET OF LECTURES ON CD DVD CALLED THE BIBLE AS THE ROOT OF WESTERN LITERATURE STORIES POEMS AND PARABLES BY PROF ADAM PORTRAY AND PROF MONICA BREZINSKI PORTRAY PRODUCED BY THE MODERN SCHOLAR

THERE'S A MORE THEORETICAL ANALYTICAL BOOK CALLED DIALOGUES OF THE WORD THE BIBLE AS LITERATURE ACCORDING TO BAKHTIN THIS ONE IS MORE ACADEMIC IN NATURE AND GOT THE PRICETAG TO GO WITH IT SEE IF YOUR UNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAS IT

YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO CHECK OUT SOME LITERATURE OR COURSE MATERIALS ON MYTHOLOGIES THEY GENERALLY TREAT THE BIBLE AS JUST ANOTHER MYTHOLOGICAL TRADITION AND USE THE SAME TOOLKIT TO ANALYZE THE BIBLE SIDE BY SIDE WITH ODYSSEYS GILGAMESH BEOWULF KING ARTHUR BEAUTY AND THE BEAST CUPID AND PSYCHE AND SO ON

CHECK OUT TRANSLATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT HE IS A GREAT TRANSLATOR ALSO DID HOMER AND THE TEXT IS PRESENTED MORE AS VERSE NUMBERS ETC AT LEAST IN MY COPY I ACTUALLY LIKE THE KV BEST TOO BUT GETTING A DIFFERENT VIEW MUCH HELP SHAKE OFF SOME OF YOUR BAGGAGE

I THINK JUST READING THE GOSPELS FIRST IN THEIR ENTIRETY NOT EVEN THAT LONG MIGHT BE A NICE START EACH ONE WAS WRITTEN BY A DIFFERENT AUTHOR AND YOU CAN START TO SEE THEIR GOALS AND INTERESTS IN THE WAY THEY TELL THE SAME STORY

WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL THERE WAS A KOINE GREEK CLASS WHERE WE READ ONE OF THE GOSPELS AS WELL AS AN EARLY GREEK NOVEL LIKE DAPHNIS AND CHLOE READING THEM TOGETHER MIGHT HELP YOU THINK ABOUT THEM IN A MORE LITERARY WAY PLUS IT'S FUN

YALE OFFERS THEIR LECTURES ON THE HEBREW BIBLE AND NEW TESTAMENT FOR FREE ON YOUTUBE REALLY COOL STUFF YOU GET INTO THE HISTORY BEHIND THE BOOKS WHY THEY WERE WRITTEN WHERE THEY GOT INFORMATION FROM AND THE LIKE AND IT IS FROM A SCHOLARLY LITERARY VIEWPOINT NOT THEOLOGY
YOU MIGHT ALSO FIND SOME INSIGHT BY LOOKING INTO COMPARATIVE MYTHOLOGY WHILE IT DOESN'T TREAT THE BIBLE AS LITERATURE EXACTLY THE EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON READING THE BIBLE SYMBOLICALLY SPECIFICALLY AND I WILL RISK THE POTENTIAL BACKLASH OUT OF GENUINE LOVE FOR HIS WORK I RECOMMEND JOSEPH CAMPBELL THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES WOULD BE A GREAT STARTING PLACE BUT PLEASE CONSIDER READING SOME OF HIS OTHER BOOKS TOO IF YOU TAKE A SHINE TO APPROACH

ALSO THE GOLDEN BOUGH OFFERS A LENGTHY DISCUSSION OF JESUS LIFE STORY JUST BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T READ THE ABRIDGED VERSION AS THIS SECTION TENDS TO BE CUT OUT FOR BEING CONTROVERSIAL YOU CAN HOWEVER FIND A FULL PDF ONLINE PRETTY EASILY THOUGH
IN SENIOR ENGLISH CLASS WE READ JOB DURING THE POETRY MODULE IT'S RIPE WITH METAPHOR IMAGERY INTERNAL CONFLICT HUBRIS THE WORKS

I ALSO SAW A LESSON A LONG TIME AGO THAT POSED JOB AS A STORY PASSED DEV THROUGH GENERATIONS TO TEACH PEOPLE CERTAIN LIFE LESSONS MUCH LIKE THE GREEKS DID WITH THE MYTHOLOGY OBLIGATORY DISCLAIMER I'M A CHRISTIAN I LOVE MY JESUS AND NOT A SINGLE REDDITION CAN CHANGE THAT

EDIT OOPS
ROBERT ALTER HAS BEEN STEADILY TRANSLATING THE OLD TESTAMENT BEGINNING WITH THE PENTATEUCH HE WROTE A GREAT BOOK ALSO CALLED THE ART OF BIBLICAL NARRATIVE WHICH EXAMINES THE BIBLE LIKE LITERATURE ON THE OTHER COAST THERE IS A PROFESSOR AT HARVARD WHO HAS DONE GREAT WORK ON THE BIBLE AS STORY

I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE THE BILL SERIES GENESIS A LIVING CONVERSATION ONE OF THE GREATEST SERIES PBS HAS EVER DONE

SOMEONE MENTIONED LATTIMORE EARLIER IN THIS THREAD HE IS GREAT TOO HOWEVER UNLIKE ALTER HIS HAS NO COMMENTARY
THE BIBLE CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PASSAGES IN ALL OF LITERATURE BOOK OF JOB IS TOP TIER LIT ITS ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE WESTERN CANON
YOU HAD THAT GARBAGE DRILLED INTO YOU FOR YEARS PUT IT AWAY AND READ SOMETHING ELSE

THE QUOTATION IS FROM THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING GANDALF SPEAKING TO FRODO ABOUT LEAVING THE SHIRE

GREAT WRITER WITH SOME VERY STRONG AND SUBTLE STORIES CHECK HIM OUT IF YOU CAN
DOES BUYING A TREADMILL MAKE THE BUYERS RUN MORE NOT ALWAYS
WOULD BUYING A TREADMILL HELP YOU EXERCISE MORE

I THINK THE PRINCIPLE IS THE SAME
I READ ALOT WHEN YOUNGER BUT STOPPED IN MY TEENS TILL ABOUT WHEN I BOUGHT A KINDLE

MADE A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE FOR ME LESS STORAGE SPACE REQUIRED FOR BOOKS AND PRETTY MUCH AN UNLIMITED CHOICE OF BOOKS ONLY A FEW BUTTON PRESSES AWAY

I ALSO FIND IT EASIER FOR READING IN BED AS I CAN LAY ON MY SIDE HOLDING IT ONE HANDED RATHER THAN TRYING TO HOLD A HEAVY PAPERBACK OPEN
ALSO PREFER TO BE CARRYING IT AROUND TO WORK TRAVELLING ETC RATHER THAN A PAPER BOOK JUST FIND IT EASIER AND I HAVE MY SELECTION WITH ME

MAYBE IT WOULD HELP YOU FOR THOSE REASONS ALSO MAYBE IT WOULDNT
WORTH A SHOT IF YOU WANT TO TRY READING MORE THOUGH


I LIKE THE INTERFACE KINDLE STORES VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED BOOKS WITHOUT THE CLUTTER OF PREVIOUSLY READ ITEMS LAYING AROUND
I THINK THERE'S REALLY NO TELLING FOR SURE BUT MY SO RECENTLY GOT AN IPAD AND HE'S BEEN A READING MACHINE EVER SINCE BEFORE THAT HE READ STARTED READING THEN ABANDONED MAYBE OR BOOKS THIS YEAR HE'S HAD THAT IPAD FOR ABOUT WEEKS AND HE'S PROBABLY READ MORE THAN BOOKS
A BIT LATE BUT I'VE ACTUALLY FOUND THAT SWITCHING TO AN AUDIO FORMAT HAS REALLY HELPED ME GET THROUGH MANY OF THE BOOKS ON MY LIST

MY ISSUE WAS ALWAYS THAT I COULD BE DOING OTHER THINGS INSTEAD OF SITTING DOWN AND READING FOR HOURS A DAY IF I PUT IN MY HEADPHONES AND LISTEN TO AN HOWEVER I CAN STILL GET MY LAUNDRY FOLDED OR MY DISHES WASHED THAT HAS REALLY CUT DOWN THE TIME IT WOULD NORMALLY TAKE ME TO GET THROUGH A BOOK

NOW SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY BAD AT MULTITASKING I'M NOT I LOVE TO TURN ON A BOOK AND PLAY THE SHIT OUT OF MINECRAFT I LISTEN BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP AS I'M IN THE SHOWER ETC ETC I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT ONCE THEY START DOING A TASK THEY LOSE FOCUS ON THE BOOK AND MISS THINGS I DON'T HAVE THIS TROUBLE

I WOULD SUGGEST TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE
IT CAN I FIND KINDLE READING EASIER BECAUSE YOU CAN LAY IT ON A FLAT SURFACE AND NOT HAVE TO AWKWARDLY KEEP THE BOOK OPEN IT'S A LOT EASIER TO EAT AND READ
IT IS A QUALITY VS QUANTITY THING FOR ME WHEN I BUST OUT MY KINDLE I READ A LOT MORE BOOKS AT ONCE BECAUSE I CAN IT DECREASES READING RETENTION IN MY EXPERIENCE
I WAS NOT A READER UNTIL I BOUGHT A KINDLE BUT AS A YOUNG SOLDIER THERE WERE ONLY SO MANY NINTENDO DS GAMES I COULD PLAY BEFORE BOREDOM GOT TO ME I BOUGHT ONE OF THE FIRST KINDLES WHEN THEY WERE PRICED REALLY HIGH AND I HAVE BEEN READING PRETTY NON STOP EVER SINCE I HAVE A COUPLE HUNDRED BOOKS ON MY KINDLE I ADD TONS OF BOOKS TO MY WATCH LIST AND SORT IT WEEKLY BY PRICE DROPS AND END UP GETTING A LOT FOR FREE OR A DOLLAR PLUS IT GOT ME INTERESTED IN COLLECTING PHYSICAL BOOKS AS WELL I USE A KINDLE VOYAGE NOW BUT ALSO HAVE A FIRE FOR ROAD TRIPS LOVE KINDLE
SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IT DEFINITELY REIGNITED MY INTEREST IN READING I LIKED THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE A SMALL WITH SEVERAL BOOKS ON IT IN CASE I WANTED TO READ SOMETHING DIFFERENT DAY-TO-DAY IT DEFINITELY WAS MORE PRACTICAL THAN CARRYING SEVERAL BOOKS AROUND WITH ME ON MY COMMUTE

HOWEVER THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT KINDLE BOOKS TURNED OUT TO BE PRICIER THAN I IMAGINED I PERUSE AND SOMETIMES LUCK OUT WITH A DAILY DEAL FOR A BOOK I WANT AND I ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO KINDLE UNLIMITED AND SOME OF THE BOOKS ARE GREAT BUT A LOT OF THE BOOKS AREN'T ALWAYS UP MY ALLEY IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THOUGH I ALTERNATE NOW BETWEEN GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND READING MY KINDLE
IT MAKES READING MORE ACCESSIBLE AND EASY TO TRANSPORT ALSO YOU DONT HAVE FAFF OF HOLDING A BOOK OPEN AND CAN ADJUST THE LIGHT ALSO AS ITS AN INVESTMENT YOU MIGHT FEEL MORE INCLINED
OVERALL THOUGH JUST SET YOURSELF TO READ FOR MINS BEFORE BED AND SEE HOW IT GOES
MANY PEOPLE PREFER PAPER BOOKS WHEN COMPARED TO HOWEVER I ACTUALLY THINK MY KINDLE HAS HELPED ME READ MORE WITH MY KINDLE I CAN THROW IT IN MY PURSE AND ALWAYS HAVE A BOOK ON ME NO MATTER WHAT I ALSO DO MOST OF MY READING BEFORE BED AND IT ALLOWS ME TO READ IN THE DARK OR LAY ON MY SIDE AND READ WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT PAGES GETTING IN THE WAY I LIKE READING TRADITIONAL BOOKS BUT I PREFER MY PROBABLY AN UNPOPULAR OPINION
I READ OF THE TIME ON A KINDLE DEVICE MOSTLY BECAUSE OF COMFORT AND ADJUSTABLE LIGHTING

I ALSO BUY THE BOOK AND PAPERBACK VERSION YOU KNOW JUST IN CASE BUT I'VE PERSONALLY READ MORE SINCE OWNING MY KINDLES I ALSO LIKE THAT IF I'M READING A CHINKER I DON'T GET DISAPPOINTED AND DISCOURAGED WITH MYSELF AT HOW MUCH IS UNREAD


IT HAS BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS IT'S VERY PORTABLE AND IF YOU HAVE FLEXIBLE MORALS YOU CAN GET PRETTY MUCH ANY BOOK YOU WANT FOR FREE WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT FOR IT TO BE AVAILABLE IN YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY

ON THE DOWNSIDE YOU LOSE THE INTANGIBLE NICE FEELING OF A GOOD SOLID BOOK WITH AN ATTRACTIVE COVER AND THAT ANCIENT SMELL THIS MIGHT NOT BE A DOWNSIDE FOR YOU SINCE YOU SAY YOU FEEL MORE ATTACHED TO A COMPUTER THAN PAPER

ONE THING I FIND IS THAT IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO STICK WITH A BOOK BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY BOOKS ON YOUR KINDLE THAT FLICKING TO A DIFFERENT ONE IS TEMPTING
I LIKE TO USE THE GOOGLE PLAY BOOKS APP ON MY PHONE IT DOES MEAN THAT I READ MORE BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT I AM NEVER WITHOUT A BOOK LIKE I'M NEVER WITHOUT A PHONE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT I'LL GO FOR A RUN WITH A HARDCOVER THEN SIT BY THE WATER AND READ A BOOK BUT I HAVE MY PHONE WITH ME SO I CAN SIT DOWN AND READ A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS THERE PUBLIC TRANSPORT WAITING FOR DINNER DATES TO SHOW UP ETC
IT DEFINITELY HELPED ME BUT IT DEPENDS ON YOU
I THINK IT DEPENDS I LOVE BOOKS BUT HAD REACHED A POINT OF VERY LITTLE SPACE LEFT TO FILL AND I GET EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED TO THEM TOO SO GETTING RID IS A REAL ISSUE I WAS ALSO FINDING I HAD LITTLE TIME

KINDLE WAS FOR ME A REVELATION AS MANY BOOKS AS I WANTED ALL IN ONE PLACE AND NEVER HAVING TO GIVE THEM UP AGAIN ONCE I'D READ THEM I COULD HAVE ALL OF MY OLD FAVORITES WITH ME AND DROP IN ON THEM WHENEVER I WANTED BUY NEW BOOKS AND READ WHENEVER I POSSIBLY COULD THANKS TO THE BACKLIGHT TOO I READ MORE THAN I EVER DID NOW PURELY BECAUSE IT'S SO TRANSPORTABLE I ALSO LIKE MY BOOKS PRISTINE NO CRACKED SPINES HERE SO THE THOUGHT OF A NOVEL SLUNG IN MY BAG BRINGS ME OUT IN A COLD SWEAT

THE QUALITY OF MY READING HAS SOMEWHAT SUFFERED THOUGH I DO READ AN AWFUL LOT OF TRIPE NOW PURELY BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP FREE AND IT PASSES SOME TIME I READ INSTEAD OF WATCHING TV THOUGH SO I SUPPOSE IT'S MY EQUIVALENT OF A CRAP FILM SOAP THAT YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T WATCH BUT STILL DO AND MY TO BE READ LIST IS IMMENSE AND GROWS WEEKLY

I STILL VISIT WATERSTONES AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE AND SNIFF THE BOOKS BUT JUST ADD THEM TO MY KINDLE WISH LIST
SINCE I BOUGHT MY FIRST BOOK READER I'VE READING MORE I CAN HAVE IT ON ME EVERYWHERE I GO AND I DON'T NEED A SOURCE OF LIGHT ALSO THE SCREEN DOESN'T EXHAUST ME LIKE A BOOK DID

I PERSONALLY WOULD THINK IT WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO BE HONEST IF A PERSON IS KEEN TO READ BOOKS HE WILL READ THEM WITH A KINDLE OR WITHOUT
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE KINDLE AS WELL IS THE SOLE FUNCTION FOR BOOKS OR DOES IT HAVE A BROWSER TOO I FEEL LIKE HAVING AN INTEGRATED BROWSER WOULD AGGRAVATE MY ADDENDUM
YOU WILL NEVER READ MORE UNLESS YOU LIKE WHAT YOU READ FOCUS ON THEMES AND GENRES MORE THAT DEVICES YOU WILL FIND YOUR NICHE
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF MOTIVATION YOU HAVE FOR READING HONESTLY IF KNOWING THAT A BOOK IS LITERALLY IN YOUR GRASP AND YOU'RE NOT READING IT DRIVES YOU INSANE THEN YOU'D PROBABLY BECOME AN AVID READER FROM BUYING A KINDLE OR DOWNLOADING BOOKS ONTO A FREQUENTED ELECTRONIC THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT FOR ME I HAVE LIKE TEN UNREAD BOOKS ON MY PHONE AS I TYPE AND I HAVE NO DESIRE TO READ THEM AGAIN I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE PHYSICAL COPIES OF ALL OF THEM AND WISH I HADN'T WASTED THE EACH ALSO READING A BOOK ON YOUR ELECTRONICS IS A LOT DIFFERENT FROM READING ARTICLES OR SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AT LEAST FOR ME THE TWO EXPERIENCES ARE NOTHING ALIKE IN MY OPINION IT FEELS WRONG TO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BOOK IN MY HAND AS I'M READING THE STORY
MAYBE IT DID FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S SO PORTABLE ANY TIME I FIND MYSELF WAITING TEN MINUTES I READ TEN PAGES OF SOMETHING BUT FOR YOU IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN LOTS OF DETAILS ABOUT A SUBJECT INSTEAD OF MANY OVERVIEWS OF DIFFERENT SUBJECTS MAYBE SOMEONE CAN LEND YOU ONE TO TRY
NOT REALLY IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY ON BOOKS BUT UNLESS YOU'RE ACTIVELY READING ALREADY IT'S DOUBTFUL THAT A TABLET WITH GAMES AND APPS ON IT IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT
NUMBER MAKES IT EASIER TO IGNORE BOOKS IMHO LOOKING AT A STACK OF REAL BOOKS MAKES ME WANT TO READ MORE WITH THAT SAID IT'S STILL A GOOD PURCHASE
I DON'T THINK IT WILLIAM

IF YOU AREN'T READING BOOKS NOW THEN IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT GENRE OF BOOKS WILL INTEREST YOU YOU SHOULD TRY GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND TRYING OUT A FEW DIFFERENT BOOKS IF YOU START FINDING SOMETHING YOU LOVE THEN PERHAPS THEN MAKE THAT TRANSITION AND GET A KINDLE
I DOUBT IT BUT MAYBE I DON'T REALLY USE MY KINDLE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A SPACE SAVER IT IS MUCH NICER TO READ THAN A BACKLIT PHONE BUT I STILL PREFER BOOKS

SO I USE THE KINDLE MOSTLY WHEN I TRAVEL WHEN I WILL BE READING TOO MUCH TO WANT TO USE MY PHONE APP BUT DON'T WANT TO LUG AROUND HEAVY BOOKS

THE KEY THOUGH IS I WAS AN AVID READER BEFORE THE KINDLE AND WILL BE AFTER IT I USE IT WHEN I WOULD OTHERWISE USE BOOKS IF YOU DON'T ENJOY BOOKS I CAN'T SEE YOU USING A KINDLE
I KNOW WE'RE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE US ELECTION AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW BUT EVEN BEFORE THE ELECTION IT SEEMED LIKE A LOT OF POPULAR THREADS BOILED DOWN TO ARGUMENTS ON RACISM AND SEXISM IT'S ANNOYING IT'S EXHAUSTING AND IT'S MADE THE TONE LESS INCLUSIVE AND WELCOMING AND MORE DIVISIVE AND DISRESPECTFUL

I THOUGHT LITERATURE WAS CELEBRATED HERE BECAUSE IT LETS YOU PEEK INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES SEE THINGS FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVES EVEN IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THEM

I KNOW THERE'S NOT MUCH THE MODS CAN DO AND THEY PROBABLY SEE WORSE STUFF THAT GETS BANNED OR BLOCKED BUT THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT R BOOKS AT THE MOMENT
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK YOU GUYS DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB ESPECIALLY WITH HOW BIG THE SUB IS YOU GUYS ARE WHAT ALLOWS ME TO COME BY EVERY DAY AND LURK ON ALL THE THREADS
THIS IS THE SMOOTHEST RUN SUB I FREQUENT ON REDDIN YOU GUYS ARE DOING AN AWESOME JOB WITH CRATING MODERATING AND KEEPING UP WITH EVERYTHING

CHEERS
I REALLY DISLIKE THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T CREATE A THREAD ASKING FOR SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS I'VE TRIED THE SUBREDDITS DEDICATED TO RECOMMENDATIONS HOWEVER THEY DONT GET NEARLY THE AMOUNT OF VIEWS REPLIES EVEN THE RECOMMENDATION THREADS DON'T
WE STILL HAVE A HARRY POTTER MEGA THREAD AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE WHICH ONLY GETS LIKE 2 POSTS A WEEK
I GUESS THE ONLY THING I'D WANT TO SEE LESS OF IS TALKING ABOUT READING IN GENERAL PAPER BOOKS VERSUS KINDLES READING SITTING UP VERSUS LAYING DOWN DOES ANYONE ELSE FEEL REALLY SMART FOR READING OBVIOUSLY IT'S OKAY TO TALK ABOUT READING IN GENERAL BUT MAYBE A META THREAD IT'S SO HARD TO MEASURE THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S NOT CRACKED DOWN ON I'M OKAY WITH WHO'S THE BEST PROTAGONIST BUT IT'S HARD TO JUMP IN ON DISCUSSIONS OF READING AS A CONCEPT AND THEY GET REPETITIVE

OTHER THAN THAT I LIKE TALKS ABOUT BOOKS I'LL EVEN JUMP IN ON THE MILLIONTH CATCHER IN THE RYE DISCUSSION AND THE AUTHOR AMAS ARE AWESOME
THANK YOU FOR DOING A GREAT JOB I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE YOUR RIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF THE PERSONAL CONDUCT RULE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE DON'T FEEL ATTACKED HERE IT'S OK TO DISAGREE BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A RESPECTFUL WAY TO DO IT THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE NAME-CALLING MOCKING ANGRY SARCASM ETC KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
COULD WE DO A STICKED GROUP OF THREADS WITH BOOK SUGGESTIONS FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS MAYBE LIKE A DADS ONE AND THEN A MOMS THEN BROTHERS ETC AND THEN PEOPLE COULD POST WHAT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS FRIENDS ARE LIKE AND PEOPLE CAN MAKE BOOK SUGGESTIONS
I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE MORE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF BOOKS CONTENTS AND FEWER POSTS ABOUT HOW WE READ WHERE WE READ OR WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN OUR PERSONAL LIVES WHILE WE WERE READING ANYTHING TO INCENTIVIZE DISCUSSION BASED ON THE WRITING WOULD BE GREAT
I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF HAVING A THE BLOCK OF TEXT REQUIREMENT FOR TEXT POSTS WHEN PEOPLE CAN POST LINKS TO ARTICLES WITH REALLY NO THOUGHT ATTACHED


BUT I REALLY DO LIKE THE SUB AND I'M SURE THAT RULE WAS ENACTED FOR A REASON


MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BUT I AM A LITTLE TIRED OF SEEING THE FRONT PAGE OF R BOOKS DOMINATED BY THE SAME I JUST READ INSERT THE SAME TEN BOOKS AND AUTHORS THREADS I GET THAT PEOPLE SEE THESE BOOKS MENTIONED ALL THE TIME AND THEN GO AND READ THEM BUT DOES EVERY SINGLE PERSON NEED THEIR OWN DEDICATED THREAD ABOUT IT

I WOULD LIKE TO NOT SEE THOSE THREADS SO MUCH ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN USE THE SUBREDDIT SEARCH BAR AND HAVE THE OTHER THIRTY OR FIFTY THREADS POP UP I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR HOW TO COMBAT THAT THOUGH
THIS SUBREDDIT ROCKS IMO
I WISH YOU WOULD BAN THE DEBATE ME ON WHY I SHOULD BUY AN BOOK READER THREADS THEY ARE POINTLESS REALLY THEY ARE JUST AS BAD AS THE WHERE CAN I BUY BOOKS THREADS IF YOU CAN FIND REDDIN YOU CAN FIND A SEARCH ENGINE

THESE ARE REALLY JUST REQUEST THREADS IN DISGUISE AND YOU BAN THOSE OUTSIDE OF WEEKLY THREADS THESE SHOULD BE BANNED TOO
PRETTY GOOD LIST OF ANTHOLOGIES HERE I WOULD ADD AFTERWARDS HETP AS ANOTHER ONE THAT'S WORTHWHILE TO TAKE A LOOK THROUGH

THERE'S ALSO VET LIT HOW WE REMEMBER WAR THAT'S WORTH ANOTHER LOOK ALSO VETS

OVERALL IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THIS WAR IF I AM TO SPEAK OF THE WAR ON TERROR AS ONE HAS PRODUCED QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENT WORKS SOME ARE CERTAINLY WORTH THE TROUBLE AND AS YOU KNOW WITH COLLECTIONS OF SHORTS OR NOVELS THERE ARE A FEW OF THOSE OUT TOO


I CONTRIBUTED TO A COUPLE OF BOTH OF THESE BUT ALONG WITH WORKING WITH HOMELESS VETS THIS HAS A LARGE SCOPE TO INCLUDE OUTSIDE THE WAR ON TERROR
ON WRITING BY STEVEN KING IS AMAZING EVERYONE SHOULD LISTEN TO IT
TINA BOSSYPANTS I READ IT AND THEN A FEW YEARS LATER IT WAS THE BOOK OF THE MONTH FOR BOOKCLUB SO I LISTENED TO IT THE AUDIOBOOK WAS SO GOOD
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW AMAZING THE WORKS OF RENOWNED AUTHOR DAN BROWN WOULD BE MY MIND WOULD BE FLUTTERING AROUND IN JOY LIKE A CAGE OF BIRDS THAT ARE FLYING AROUND INSIDE THAT CAGE
I JUST LISTENED TO NORM BOOK NARRATED BY NORM MACDONALD IT WAS GREAT BASICALLY LIKE A HOUR COMEDY SET
MICK FOLEY HAVE A NICE DAY
NOT BETTER BUT JUST AS GOOD AND WORTH CHECKING OUT IN AUDIO FORMAT WAS WORLD WAR Z IT WAS ABRIDGED WHICH KEEPS IT FROM BEING BETTER BUT THE VOICE ACTORS KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK ON THAT ONE IT MADE A CAR RIDE FROM WV TO VT GO BY VERY QUICKLY
BORN STANDING UP BY STEVE MARTIN IS A MUST IF YOU LOVE COMEDY

REALLY ANY COMEDIANS MEMOIRS BIOGRAPHY SHOULD BE HEARD RATHER THAN READ AAAAAAND THAT'S A SENTENCE I NEVER THOUGHT I'D WRITE
I'D SAY THE MARTIAN WAS MORE ENJOYABLE AS AN AUDIOBOOK BECAUSE ALL OF THE BITS ON MARS ARE HIS LOGS IT JUST ADDS AN EXTRA LAYER OF IMMERSION TO HEAR THEM AS OPPOSED TO READING THEM
POP BEST AS AUDIOBOOKS IMO I HAD A BIG AUDIOBOOK PHASE ONE SUMMER IN COLLEGE WHEN I LISTENED TO MOST OF THE POPULAR NONFICTION AUDIOBOOKS AT THE TIME FREAKONOMICS BLINK PREDICTABLY IRRATIONAL AND I FELT LIKE I MANAGED TO ABSORB A LOT MORE OF IT THAN THE FICTION I LISTENED TO
BOOKS WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL WRITING STYLE OR UNIQUE DIALOGUE CAN BE HELPED WITH A GOOD NARRATOR THE AUDIOBOOK FOR INHERENT VICE DOES A GREAT JOB OF PUTTING ON A STONER DIALECT AND READING LIKE HE WAS HALF-BAKED
RICHARD POE READING CORMAC BLOOD MERIDIAN IS PRETTY EXCELLENT BUT THEN AGAIN IF I HADN'T GOTTEN INTIMATE HEH ALRIGHT WITH THE TEXT FIRST IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMING TO HEAR

I'M CURRENTLY LISTENING TO THE GAME OF THRONES SERIES REALLY DIGGING IT THIS STYLE OF NARRATIVE IS PRETTY WELL SUITED TO THE AUDIOBOOK MEDIUM METHINKS

I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE CANTERBURY TALES AS WELL IT'S SO RICHARD TAKES FOCUS THOUGH EASY TO SPACE OUT BUT I DON'T MIND REPLAYING AD NAUSEUM

MY LOCAL LIBRARY HAS A LOT OF BBC STAGE PRODUCTIONS OF THE WORKS OF AGATHA CHRISTIE AND THOSE CAN BE FUN FROM TIME TO TIME

TYPICALLY THOUGH I'M LISTENING TO NONFICTION HISTORIES AND BIOGRAPHIES THESE GENRES ARE WHAT I'VE FOUND WORKS BEST FOR AUDIOBOOKS I TEND TO THINK OF IT AS SOMETHING LIKE A UNIVERSITY LECTURE
I'M NOT SURE IF HE'S WELL REPRESENTED ON AUDIBLE BUT RECORDED BOOKS HAS A PARTICULAR READER SIMON PREBBLE WHO DOES WONDERS WITH THE CHARLES PARIS MYSTERIES BY SIMON BRETT AND ANYTHING IN THE PAGE G RODENHOUSE JEEVES SERIES HE'S GOT A TON OF OTHER TITLES ON THERE FROM H G WELLS TO DICK FRANCIS
I THINK NON FICTION AND AUTOBIOGRAPHIES ARE REALLY GOOD IN AUDIO FORM
RICHARD DAWKINS A BRIEF CANDLE IN THE DARK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE
A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE AND THE LORD OF THE RINGS

BOTH OF THOSE SERIES ARE ONES THAT I HAVE TRIED TO READ OVER AND OVER THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE WRITING THOUGH IN BOTH

I JUST COULDN'T SEEM TO GET MY HEAD AROUND ALL OF THE PLACES AND PEOPLE I HONESTLY WOULD JUST FEEL CONFUSED AND WOULD PUT THEM DOWN HOWEVER ONCE I GOT THE I GOBBLED THEM UP ROY DORICE FOR ABSOIL IS AWESOME
BLAKE CROUCH DID AN AMA HERE IN R BOOKS YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK HERE'S A FULL LIST OF OUR UPCOMING AMAS

I AM A BOT AND THIS ACTION WAS PERFORMED AUTOMATICALLY PLEASE CONTACT THE MODERATORS OF THIS SUBREDDIT MESSAGE COMPOSE TO R BOOKS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS
I LOVE LISTENING TO THE GUIDE TO THE GALAXY BOOKS AT NIGHT BEFORE BED WHEN MY EYES ARE TOO TIRED TO READ I'VE LISTENED TO OTHER VARIETIES OF BOOKS BUT FICTION IS MY FAVORITE ON AUDIBLE REMINDS ME OF BEING A KID I SUPPOSE WHEN TEACHERS AND PARENTS WOULD READ FUN ADVENTURE STORIES ALOUD NARNIA WAS MY FAVORITE AS A CHILD
I LOVED THE AUDIOBOOK FOR SLEEPING GIANTS BY SYLVAIN HEUVEL BECAUSE IT'S MAINLY DIALOGUE AND INTERVIEWED THEY GOT DIFFERENT ACTORS FOR THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS AND IT WAS AWESOME
I REALLY ENJOY AUDIOBOOKS THAT DIFFERENTIATE CHARACTER VOICES HELPS WITH SWITCHING DIALOGUE
THE WATCHMAKER OF FILIGREE STREET WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT WITHOUT SPOILING IT I'LL SAY THAT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT ACCENT CHANGE THAT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR IT THE CHRONICLES OF ST SERIES IS ANOTHER ONE IT'S VERY JOKEY AT TIMES AND THE NARRATOR IS A HUGE PART OF THAT
TWO BOOKS EVERYONE MUST LISTEN TO ON AUDIOBOOK

THE ALCHEMIST READ BY JEREMY IRONS MIND BLOWING

2 HARRY POTTER SERIES READ BY JIM DALE HE DOES OVER UNIQUE VOICES

LOVED THE BOOKS BUT THE AUDIO WAS AMAZING
FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS WITH HARRY DEAN STANTON JIM JARMUSCH AND JOAN CUSACK ON MARGARITAVILLE RECORDS ITS AN ADAPTION OF A STAGE PLAY
I ALWAYS THOUGHT GADDIS WOULD BE INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO ON AUDIO NOT SURE IF THERE EVEN ARE ANY THOUGH I CHECKED ONCE BUT COULDN'T FIND THEM FOR SALE
THE ARTEMIS FOWL SERIES READ BY NATHANIEL PARKER AMAZING
HIS DARK MATERIALS TRILOGY THE GOLDEN COMPASS ETC THE VOICING IS AMAZING
ALL THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES AND NOVELS THEY ARE AWESOME AS DRAMATIC READINGS TOO

IF YOU CAN STOMACH THE MATERIAL GONE WITH THE WIND IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING AUDIO BOOKS I HAVE EVER LISTENED TOO IT IS WELL OVER HOURS I GOT IT AS PART OF A FREE TRIAL TO AUDIBLE THEN CANCELLED IT IS ALSO ROUTINELY PUT ON YOUTUBE
NOT BOOKS PER SAY BUT I ALWAYS ENJOYED THE AUDIOBOOK VERSIONS OF PLAYS WE HAD TO READ FOR CLASSICAL THAT SHIT IS NOT MEANT TO BE READ SILENTLY
A HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY THE NARRATION ADDS THAT LITTLE BIT MORE TO ALL OF THE ORDERED CHAOS
I FIND LONG NON FICTION TO BETTER ON AUDIOBOOK BUT I'VE ENJOYED A LOT OF FICTION AS WELL MY SENSE IS THAT IT IS IDIOSYNCRATIC DEPENDING ON YOUR INTEREST THE QUALITY OF THE READING ETC NOT SURE IF THERE IS A GENERAL RULE
I DON'T REALLY MEAN TO BE FLIPPANT BUT MY LIBRARY HAS A REALLY AWESOME SERVICE FOR DIGITAL BOOKS GIFTING A KINDLE IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE ONE ALREADY AND SETTING IT UP TO WORK WITH HER LOCAL LIBRARY'S OVERDRIVE SERVICE WOULD BE A PRETTY AWESOME GIFT
YOU COULD GET HER A KINDLE UNLIMITED SUBSCRIPTION IT OFFERS A LARGE COLLECTION OF TITLES FOR FREE AMAZON SITE SAYS OVER MILLION CHECK IT OUT

YOU CAN CHECK OUT GOOGLE PLAY BOOKS TOO BUT I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION PLAN YOU'D HAVE TO BUY BOOKS INDIVIDUALLY YOU COULD GIVE HER A GIFT VOUCHER TO REDEEM
TRY SCRIBE YOU COULD TRY THEIR DAY FREE TRIAL FEE PER MONTH IS THEY PROVIDE YOU WITH BOOKS AND AUDIOBOOK EACH MONTH AND UNLIMITED ACCESS TO MAGAZINES AND NEWS ARTICLES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS THEIR SELECTIONS ARE GREAT CHECK OUT THEIR RATES IN THEIR WEBSITE
DOES SHE LIKE USING A KINDLE READER OR SIMILAR A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL PREFER THE OLD FASHIONED PHYSICAL COPY OF A BOOK A GIFT VOUCHER FOR BOOK SHOP MIGHT WORK IF SO
HAMM I'M NOT FAMILIAR THAT THERE IS SUCH SERVICE THE BEST YOU CAN GO WITH IS KINDLE AND
I STILL PREFER PHYSICAL BOOKS BUT KINDLE IS WALLET SAVER OFTEN
STORYTELLER BEST PLATFORM FOR AUDIOBOOKS ITS LIKE NETFLIX FOR BOOKS
THERE WAS A NETFLIX FOR BOOKS CALLED OYSTER BUT I BELIEVE IT SHUT DOWN YOU MIGHT TRY GOOGLING FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS THOUGH
EAST OF EDEN BY JOHN STEINBECK IS A PERSONAL FAVORITE OF MINE THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT DOWN-TO-EARTH VIEW OF HUMANITY THAT I FOUND REFRESHING IT TAUGHT ME THAT HUMANITY IS BEAUTIFUL IN SPITE OF OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF OUR FLAWS

WHAT DID YOU GUYS THINK OF EAST OF EDEN DID IT HAVE A STRONG IMPACT ON YOU DID IT HOLD YOUR INTEREST
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO READ LESS GENRE FICTION THIS YEAR AND IT'S BEEN MUCH MORE REWARDING THOUGH MUCH MORE OF A CHALLENGE TO FOCUS ON LITERARY FICTION I DON'T THINK I'VE STUMBLED UPON ANY NEW FAVORITES PER SE HOWEVER BUT I DO FEEL LIKE MY WORLD HAS EXPANDED IMMENSELY COMPARED TO WHEN I WAS READING MOSTLY UMPTEENTH DECONSTRUCTION OF WESTERN FANTASY TROPES OR GRITTY CYBERPUNK NOVEL AD

HERE ARE MY FAVORITES

THE BRIEF AND WONDROUS LIFE OF OSCAR WAC BY JUNOT DIAZ REMAINS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS THE WRITING IS FUNNY AND INCISIVE AND THE STORY IS GREAT

FATES AND THE FURIES WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS I READ LAST YEAR THE CHARACTERS WERE SO SHARPLY REALIZED AND THE THEMES WERE JUST WONDERFULLY FLESHED OUT

ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE WAS THE OTHER BOOK THAT AS ON A LOT OF THE BEST OF LISTS THAT TOTALLY DESERVED IT THE WRITING WAS INCREDIBLE AND THE STORY REALLY DREW YOU IN
I'D REALLY RECOMMEND SNOW COUNTRY BY YASUNARI KAWABATA AS A BOOK AUTHOR YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD OF I PICKED IT UP ON A WHIM IN A SECOND HAND BOOK SHOP AND IT IS ON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOKS I HAVE READ AND HAS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PASSAGES IN ANY BOOK

THE BOOK WON THE NOBLE PRIZE FOR ITS BEAUTIFUL LYRICAL STYLE I WISH I COULD READ IT IN THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE AS I WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT WAS LOST IN TRANSLATION

IT'S ONLY AROUND PAGES LONG SO IT CAN BE READ IN A FEW HOURS I FOUND NO DISCUSSION OF IT ON THIS SUBREDDIT JUST SOME PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT WHICH REALLY DISHEARTENED ME AND MADE ME UNDUB FROM HERE AMONG OTHER THINGS
ORPHAN MASTERS SON BY ADAM JOHNSON
WIND-UP BIRD CHRONICLE BY HARUKI MURAKAMI
SOME OF MY FAVORITE LITERARY FICTION IS SHORT FICTION FLANNERY STORY A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND COMES TO MIND

JUST IT AGAIN A FEW OF THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT IT EVERY PIECE OF GOTHIC IMAGERY SUPPORTS THE ENDING HOW WE GET FROM POINT A FAMILY PREPARING FOR A ROAD TRIP TO THE GRUESOME POINT B

ALSO THE STORY APPEARS ON THE SURFACE TO BE DEEPLY MORAL ALMOST A PARABLE ABOUT THE EVERYDAY WICKED SEEKING FORGIVENESS ONLY ON JUDGEMENT DAY BUT O CONNOR SUBVERTS THE VERY CHARACTERISTIZATIONS THAT SHE S WORKED SO HARD TO BUILD ABOUT THE GRANDMOTHER AND THE KILLER BY IMBUING THEM VERY SKILLFULLY WITH THESE BITS OF HUMANITY AT THE END

ALSO AT THE END TAKE HER OFF AND THOW HER WHERE YOU SHOWN THE OTHERS SHOWN THEM WHAT LOVE THE WORDING HERE AGAIN THE KILLER IMPLIES HE IS WHO HE IS BECAUSE OF FREE WILL REALIZING THAT HE HAS NO CAPACITY FOR FAITH BECAUSE NOTHING IS KNOWN FOR SURE AND IF HE'D BEEN THERE TO SEE IF CHRIST HAD ACTUALLY RAISED THE DEAD HE WOULDN'T BE WHO HE IS NOW IT'S CHILLING YET LEAVES THINGS OPEN FOR INTERPRETATION AFTER READING IT TWENTY TIMES THIS STORY STILL IMPACTS ME WHILE READING A LOT OF LITERARY FICTION TODAY I CAN SEE THE NUTS AND BOLTS LEAVING ME JADED
HANDS DOWN ONE OF S BEST LIT BICS IS INNOCENTS AND OTHERS BY DANA SPIOTTA
ANYTHING BY VONNEGUT BURROUGHS AND CAIMAN BUKOWSKI IS QUITE GOOD AND HIS WORK IS CONSIDERED FICTION HOWEVER I FEEL AS THOUGH MANY OF HIS STORIES ARE ROOTED IN TRUTH
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T WRITE THE BOOKS THEMSELVES ONE THING I'M ALWAYS SURPRISED AT WITH CELEBRITIES IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS THAT BEFORE THEY BECAME WELL KNOWN FOR WHATEVER THEY'RE FAMOUS FOR THEY WERE TRAINED OR STUDIED FOR AN ADJACENT INDUSTRY A TV PRESENTER USED TO BE A SINGER AN ACTRESS STUDIED BALLET ETC SO THE RANGE IN THERE AND IF THE CREATIVE TYPES I KNOW PERSONALLY ARE ANYTHING TO GO ON THESE PEOPLE HAVE CREATIVE IDEAS ABOUT DAMN NEAR EVERYTHING A SET DESIGNER I KNOW ALSO WRITES POETRY AND SINGS IN A CHOIR FOR CHRISTMAS I KNOW SHE'LL SEND ME A HAND PAINTED CARD

AS FOR CELEBRITIES WRITING BOOKS NOT THEIR OWN HOW IS ANY DIFFERENT FROM BOOKS
THERE ARE SOME I DOUBT WROTE THEIR OWN BOOKS AND OTHERS I THINK DID WILLIAMS IS ONE I ALWAYS THINK HAS WRITTEN HIS OWN AND SURE HE WRITES LIKE DAHL BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A TERRIBLE THING BECAUSE HIS BOOKS GET KIDS READING AND I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IF CELEBRITIES CAN GET CHILDREN TO READ WHILE THEY CASH IN ON THEIR NAME THEN I'M ALL FOR IT PERSONALLY
IT'S COMMON FOR SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ONE FIELD TO WANT TO BRANCH OUT THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF ACTORS WHO ALSO PLAY IN A BAND AND MUSICIANS WHO DABBLE IN ACTING IF YOU POLLED THE EXECUTIVE SUITE IN ANY BIG COMPANY I'D BET AT LEAST A FEW OF THEM HAVE COMPLETED A MARATHON IN THE POWER OF HABIT CHARLES DUHIGG NOTES THAT WHEN PEOPLE STARTED EXERCISING AND KEEPING A FOOD JOURNAL THEY ALSO STARTED MAKING OTHER POSITIVE CHANGES IN THEIR LIVES SUCCESS IN ONE AREA PROVIDED THE TOOLS AND CONFIDENCE TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE

LOTS OF PEOPLE DREAM OF WRITING A BOOK AND CELEBRITIES FROM WHAT I HEAR ARE JUST LIKE US MOST OF US WOULD EITHER DEFER THAT DREAM OR TO A LARGELY INDIFFERENT WORLD A MOVIE STAR NOT ONLY HAS THE COURAGE TO TRY BUT CAN GET MORE ATTENTION ON HER BOOK SIMPLY BY BEING WHO SHE IS
IT FEELS LIKE SUPPORTING THE WRONG PEOPLE

IN MY VIEW WHETHER OR NOT YOU SUPPORT THE PERSON IS AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM WHETHER OR NOT YOU SUPPORT THE BOOK DO YOU FIND THE BOOK WORTHY OF SUPPORT SUPPORT IT IF NOT DON'T BOTHER IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE ANY MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
I FEEL LIKE A CHILDREN'S BOOK A TRUE CHILDREN'S BOOK NOT YA OR CHILDREN'S CHAPTER BOOKS IS NOT ALL THAT DIFFICULT TO WRITE SO IT'S NOT HARD TO BELIEVE CELEBRITIES WOULD HAVE THE TIME TO FIT THEM INTO THEIR SCHEDULES MY SIXTH GRADE CLASS WROTE CHILDREN'S BOOKS AS AN ASSIGNMENT AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE PASSABLE THOUGH THE ILLUSTRATIONS WERE PRETTY ROUGH

AND AS ANOTHER USER COMMENTED MANY CREATIVE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR HANDS IN MANY DIFFERENT ARENAS AND ARE ALWAYS COMING UP WITH NEW CREATIVE ENDEAVORS

I FEEL THE BOOKS SHOULD BE EVALUATED ON THEIR OWN MERIT NOT THE MERIT OR FAME OF THE AUTHOR BUT I SEE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THE BOOKS AREN'T A LEGIT LABOR OF LOVE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE AUTHOR WAS ALREADY FAMOUS FOR SOMETHING ELSE
THE RUSH REVERE BOOKS ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT COME TO MIND THEY ARE EXCELLENT CHILDREN'S BOOKS I DIDN'T EXPECT THEM TO BE AND I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE WAS CHEESY BUT THEN I SAW HOW MUCH MY KIDS ENJOYED THE AND THEY'RE ACCURATE HISTORY MY LITTLE KIDS NOW ARE FAMILIAR WITH NAMES LIKE WILLIAM BRADFORD SQUANTUM SAMOSET AND MASSASOIT
THE ONLY REAL PROBLEM I HAVE WITH CELEBRITY AUTHORS IS THAT THEY MOST LIKELY ARENT THE TRUE AUTHOR USUALLY YOU CAN TELL WHEN IT HAS THE CELEB NAME IN BIG BOLD PRINT AND THEN IN SMALLER PRINT WITH JOE SCHMOE WHILE THE CELEB MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED IDEAS OR THE STORY THEY CERTAINLY DIDNT AUTHOR THE BOOK

TO THE QUESTION THERE ARE SOME CELEBS THAT ACTUALLY DO WRITE THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S BOOKS ITS NOT MANY MIND YOU BUT THEY DO EXIST

DO THEY DESERVE OUR SUPPORT WHY NOT WHATS THE DIFFERENCE WHETHER A CELEB NAME IS PRINTED ON THE COVER OR NOT DOES THE STORY CHANGE JUST BECAUSE OF THAT

I DONT LIKE IT EITHER BUT AS LONG AS THE BOOK IS DECENT I SEE NO PROBLEM WITH IT
YOU'RE STILL A TEEN


YOU'RE NINE TEEN YOU SAY
JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU TURN TO READ IT THEN THEN THIS BOOK CHANGES OVER TIME AS YOUR WORLD VIEW CHANGES
I FELT THE EXACT SAME WAY WHEN I A CLOCKWORK ORANGE WHEN I FIRST READ IT AT FIFTEEN I FOUND THE ENDING FLAT AND ABRUPT AND WAS FAR MORE ENAMOURED WITH THE CRIME AND PRISON SCENES BUT WHEN I READ IT AGAIN AT TWENTY THREE I FINALLY REALISED THE MESSAGE OR MY INTERPRETATION ANYHOW THAT ALEX JUST GREW UP AT THE END THAT HIS ANTICS COULD NOT BE CURED RATHER ADOLESCENCE MUST BE EXPERIENCED AND THEN ALLOWED TO PASS WITH TIME
I READ IT WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN AND THOUGHT HE WAS AN ANGST LITTLE SHIT I DOUBT MY VIEWS WILL HAVE CHANGED
IT WILL CHANGE AND CHANGE AGAIN EACH TIME YOU READ IT THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS WITH US
I TRIED TO READ IT IN NINTH GRADE AND COULDN'T HANDLE IT HE SEEMED LIKE A FAKE I READ IT AGAIN THIS YEAR AND I RELATED TO HIM SOMETIMES ON THE BUT I FOUND THAT I ALSO HAD SIMILAR PATTERNS OF THOUGHT AS HIM AND DIDN'T WANT TO KEEP THAT PART OF MYSELF IT HELPED ME GROW SO I LIKE IT FOR THAT BUT I DIDN'T ENJOY IT LIKE I ENJOY OTHER BOOKS I THOUGHT THE ENDING WAS DUMB TOO NO PLOT AND THEN SUDDENLY IT'S A LECTURE ON HOW YOU SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL BY SOME GUY HOLDEN CAN'T EVEN TRUST AND HE TAKES IT NO THANKS I DON'T THINK HOLDEN IS NECESSARILY A PERSON NO ONE SHOULD BE EITHER THAT'S JUST TOO JUDGMENTAL
UGH FEELING YOUR PAIN MINE IS SIMILAR WHEN A MOVIE OR TV SHOW HAS A CHARACTER THEY DESCRIBE AS A GREAT LITERARY WRITER HOUSE OF TOM YATES COMES TO MIND THERE IS USUALLY A POINT WHERE THEY HAVE TO PRODUCE THIS WRITING INVARIABLY IT'S THE KIND OF PRETENTIOUS TWADDLE YOU HAVE THERE

IT'S A COMMON PROBLEM WITH BOOKS I CHEEPED A LITTLE AND FOUND HAND

OF COURSE IT HAPPENS IN BOOKS FROM ESTABLISHED PUBLISHING HOUSES TOO LIKE THE DAN BROWN NOVELS EXCESSIVE ADJECTIVES ANNOY ME TOO
OH YEAH WELL YOUR ALLITERATION WAS PRETTY POINTLESS EDIT UNLESS IT WAS TO PROVE A POINT IN THAT CASE IT WOULD HAVE A POINT
GIVES ME CONNIPTIONS
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO THERE
SUCH A GREAT BOOKSTORE RIP JIM
PERSONALLY I'VE GOTTEN MORE OUT OF THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON BUT IDEAS ARE SIMILAR I SEPARATE PERSONAL FINANCE INTO 2 COLUMNS MANAGING DEBT AND EXPENSES AND GROWING WEALTH YOU HAVE TO START WITH THE FORMER TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE LATTER
WOULDN'T IT BE DISCUSSION WISE MORE HELPFUL TO POST THIS TO A PERSONAL FINANCE SUB
SURE BUT I HAVEN'T HAD TO DEAL WITH THE CLOSURE PART YET NEITHER GAME OF THRONES OR THE NAME OF THE WIND SERIES BY THEIR COLLOQUIAL NAMES SEEM TO BE IN ANY DANGER OF FINISHING ANYTIME SOON
WW2 NAZI GERMANY WHICH I'M WEIRDLY INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME

I SEE SO MANY COMMENTS LIKE THIS WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE FEEL IT NECESSARY TO SAY THESE KIND OF UNDERCUTTING SELF-CRITICAL AND JUST PLAIN BIZARRE THINGS THERE IS NOTHING WEIRD ABOUT BEING INTERESTED IN WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED BEFORE DURING AND AFTER IN AND AROUND NAZI FUCKING GERMANY
WHENEVER I DECIDE TO REREAD THE HARRY POTTER SERIES I PLOW THROUGH THE FIRST FOUR BOOKS OR SO THEN MY PACE VERY NOTICEABLY SLOWS TO A CRAWL
A LITTLE DIFFERENT THEN YOUR EXPERIENCE BUT I WAS ALL EXCITED DURING THE MONTHS LEADING TO THE RELEASE OF DEATHLY HALLOWS I REMEMBER STANDING IN A QUEUE TO GET MY COPY AS SOON AS IT WAS OUT IT'S ONLY WHEN I REACHED HOME AND STARTED READING IT THE FEELING SANK INTO ME THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE THE LAST POTTER BOOK I HAD MADE A DEAL WITH MY SISTER THAT I WAS GONNA FINISH THE BOOK IN COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER WHICH SHE CAN TAKE HER OWN SWEET TIME TO SAVOUR IT THE TROUBLE WAS I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END THE FASTER I RUSHED TOWARDS THE END THE GUILTIER I FELT FINALLY I FINISHED THE BOOK AND FELT LIKE A PART OF MY CHILDHOOD DIED
MAYBE GEORGE R R MARTIN IS REFUSING TO FINISH GAME OF THRONES IN A TIMELY FASHION BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT IT TO END
IF YOU DON'T FINISH READING A BOOK THEN IT ENDS WHERE YOU STOPPED READING IT STILL ENDED NOTHING LASTS FOREVER IN THIS LIFE
WHAT IS THIS RESTRAINT YOU SPEAK OF
I TOOK STEPHEN ADVICE AND STOPPED READING DARK TOWER VII AT THE CHAPTER
NO BUT I'M HOLDING OFF READING UMBERTO LAST NOVEL BECAUSE AFTER I DO THERE WON'T EVER BE ANY MORE
NOT SO MUCH REFUSED TO FINISH BUT I REFUSE TO START THE SHEPHERD CROWN BY TERRY PRITCHETT I WANT THERE TO ALWAYS BE ONE PRITCHETT BOOK THAT I HAVE YET TO READ
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR ME ALTHOUGH I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THIS WAY ABOUT PARTICULAR BOOKS I ALWAYS WANT TO GET A SENSE OF THE WHOLE THING AND YOU ONLY ACHIEVE THAT BY REACHING THE END AND THEN I'M OFF AND AWAY READING THE NEXT BOOK

MAYBE THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF READER THE IMMENSER AND THE ONLOOKER I AM NEVER SO IMMERSED IN A BOOK THAT I FEEL I AM LIVING IN ANOTHER WORLD FOR ME I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR HOW THE WRITER IS DOING IT A PARTICULARLY SATISFYING PLOT DEVELOPMENT AMBUSHES ME AND I'M LIKE THE BOB PECK CHARACTER IN THE FIRST JURASSIC PARK MOVIE JUST AS HE KNOWS HE'S ABOUT TO BE EATEN I THINK ABOUT THE WRITER AND SAY TO MYSELF CLEVER GIRL OR BOY
YEAH I'VE NEVER FINISHED THE LAST DUNE BOOK BECAUSE THEN IT'LL BE OVER

I ONLY HAVE ONE UNREAD SHORT STORY FROM THE ST SERIES BY JODI TAYLOR I'LL PROBABLY GIVE IN BEFORE CHRISTMAS SO I CAN READ THIS YEAR'S CHRISTMAS STORY OVER THE HOLIDAYS
I DO THIS WITH MANY THINGS READING WRITING PROGRAMMING VISIONING IT'S A FORM OF PROCRASTINATION I PROBABLY SHOULD SAY MORE ABOUT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT BUT I'D KINDA RATHER LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW
YES I STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED THE HYPERION CANTOS WHICH I STARTED HALF A YEAR AGO MIGHT FINALLY DO IT SOMETIME NEXT YEAR MAYBE

NUMBER THE END IS INEVITABLE EMBRACE IT
NUMBER IF I LOVE A BOOK I'LL JUST IT EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS NO NEED TO PUT OFF FINISHING SOMETHING YOU LOVE IN FACT WHEN I FIRST FINISHED THE BOOK THIEF THE FIRST THING I DID WAS FLIP BACK TO PAGE AND START AGAIN DIDN'T NEED TO FINISH IT A SECOND TIME JUST WASN'T READY TO LET GO YET
I'VE HAD THE OPPOSITE WHERE I HAVE A NEW BOOK THAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE GREAT BUT THEN PUT OFF READING IT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE DISAPPOINTED
USUALLY ONCE I GET CLOSE TO THE END OF A BOOK I START READING MORE OFTEN
IT TOOK ME NEARLY TWO YEARS TO FINISH THE DICTIONARY OF THE KHAZAR BECAUSE I KEPT THE BOOK FROM A DIFFERENT CHAPTER IT'S A DICTIONARY NOVEL WHOSE ENTRIES YOU CAN READ IN BASICALLY ANY ORDER YOU CHOOSE
I MEAN I GET THE FEELING THAT I DON'T WANNA END THE GREAT STORY BUT I STILL FINISH IT

ANAND THEN FEEL EMPTY AFTERWARDS
I RECENTLY DID THIS WITH LEO WAR PEACE I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS NOVEL AND AS I GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER TO FINISHING IT IT BECAME BITTERSWEET
INTERESTINGLY NOT WITH BOOKS WHEN BANKS DIED I PICKED UP HYDROGEN SONATA AS A FAREWELL TO THAT BEAUTIFUL MANUAL I READ IT AND I WAS SAD AND HAPPY AT THE SAME TIME HAPPY BECAUSE WHAT A JOURNEY IT WAS AND DAD BECAUSE HOW MUCH MORE IT COULD HAVE BEEN

BUT VIDEO GAMES I STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED THE WITCHER AND DRAGON AGE INQUISITION MY SAVE IS SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO THE END NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE THEY ARE THAT GOOD BUT I JUST LOSE THE WILL TO PLAY RAGS TO FINISH I DONT KNOW WHY

GOOD JOB OP IT IS INSPIRING TO HEAR THAT I HOPE I'LL BE ABLE TO READ MORE NEXT YEAR I USUALLY READ AROUND FORTY BOOKS PER YEAR BUT HOPEFULLY I CAN INCREASE THAT TO OR EVEN
FUCK I WISH I COULD DO THAT

NOW I M CERTAIN I COULD BUT AMONG THE OTHER THINGS I LOVE READING IS REALLY SOMETHING TO FILL OUT THE FREE MINUTES I HAVE BETWEEN THE WORK FRIENDS TRYING TO LOOSE WEIGHT PERSONAL PROJECT PLANNING TRIPS ETC

EVERY EARLY SPRING OUR NATIONAL RAILROAD COMPANY AND AND NEXT TO EVERY TOWN START TRYING TO REPAIR OUR ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH MEANS THAT EVERY COMMUTE TO WORK AND BACK SUDDENLY TAKES AT LEAST MINUTES LONGER THAT S MY CUE TO START BINGING ON BOOKS SO I CUT THROUGH AT LEAST IN MONTH OR TWO COMPARED TO REST OF THE YEAR WHERE I HARDLY FINISH BOOKS
HOW MUCH OF EACH BOOK DO YOU RETAIN DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR ABILITY TO RETAIN INFO HAS IMPROVED DO YOU ACTIVELY READ OR PASSIVE OR BOTH
I ALSO REALIZED THERE ARE SOME FAMOUS BOOKS THAT I DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR

FOR A LONG TIME I THOUGHT I HAD TO LIKE SHAKESPEARE ESPECIALLY AS AN ENGLISH MAJOR WHO LOVES CLASSICS BECAUSE IT'S WELL SHAKESPEARE IT WAS A NICE MOMENT WHEN I FINALLY ACCEPTED THAT I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT


I'VE PICKED UP THE LONGEST BOOK OF MY LIFE TILL DATE THE STANDARD I STARTED THAT IN FEBRUARY AND I'M STILL READING IT
IMPRESSIVE TRULY IMPRESSIVE CONGRATULATIONS AND KEEP UP THE GOOD READ

NOW I'M A LITTLE ENVIOUS BECAUSE I USED TO READ AT LEAST ONE OR TWO BOOKS PER WEEK BUT FOR SOME REASON I LOST INTEREST AND I'M UNABLE TO PICK UP ANYTHING LONGER THAN A FEW PAGES
I'M ON RIGHT NOW FOR THE YEAR I SET THE GOAL AT BOOKS AND HAVE SURPASSED THAT BUT I DO IT WITH AUDIOBOOKS I WOULD NEVER HAVE THE TIME TO PHYSICALLY READ THAT MANY BOOKS IN A YEAR WELL I COULD BUT THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT AND I'M NOT LOOKING TO ABANDON EVERYTHING ELSE

ALSO IS MY FAVORITE BOOK I'M JUST BLOWN AWAY BY HOW CLOSELY OUR MODERN SOCIETY MATCHES WHAT HE PREDICTED IN THE
DO NOT READ SIMPLY TO FINISH BOOKS FINDING A PASSION FOR READING IS WORTH FINISHING BOOKS DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE I HAVE TO FINISH X BOOK BY Y DATE BECAUSE THEN THE BOOK IS UNDERVALUED
I'LL BARELY FINISH INFINITE JEST THIS YEAR NICE WORK
WELL DONE YOU BUT READING SHOULD BE A PLEASURE NOT AN OBLIGATION IF YOU ARE FORCING YOURSELF TO READ BOOKS YOU ARE PROBABLY READING THE WRONG BOOKS
I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE GLASS CASTLE
COOL MY SPECTRUM IS THE FIGHT CLUB AND THE TALE

AND I SHOULD PROBABLY SET A GOAL OF EACH YEAR TOO THAT SHALL BE MY NEW GOAL FOR THANKS FOR THE INSPIRATION OP
NICE ONE DUDE DO REDDIN POST COUNT COZ I MUST HEAVE READ AT LEAST
I KNOW IT'S NOT THE SAME BUT I AM ABLE TO LISTEN TO AUDIO BOOKS AT WORK AND REGULARLY PUT IN HOURS A DAY I'VE LISTENED TO AROUND THIS YEAR AND READ ALSO JOHN RINGO GOT ME STARTED TOO
YOU MIGHT LIKE JUMPER AND REFLEX BY STEVEN GOULD

THEY'RE FICTION AND THOUGH GENERALLY THEY ARE LABELED AS FANTASY WHICH IS REASONABLE HE CAN TELEPORT I WOULD STILL STRESS THE FICTION PART MORE BECAUSE THE FIRST BOOK IS MOSTLY ABOUT HOW HE DEALS WITH LIFE IN WHICH HE HAPPENS TO HAVE THAT ABILITY AND THE SECOND INVOLVES BEING ON THE RECEIVING END OF TORTURE AND CONDITIONING

I REMEMBER THE FIRST BOOK BEING FASCINATING BECAUSE HE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LIMITS OF HIS ABILITY ALONGSIDE SOLVING PROBLEMS FAMILY LOVE LIFE YOU KNOW AND I REMEMBER THE SECOND BOOK ACTUALLY MAKING MY STOMACH TURN NOT OUT OF DISGUST IT'S NOT A DISGUSTING BOOK BUT OUT OF PROFOUND SADNESS I COULDN'T STAND HIS POWERLESSNESS AND HIS BEING MADE PERFECTLY AWARE OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO TO HIM AND EXPERIENCING THEM SUCCEED DON'T WORRY THIS IS NOT A SPOILER THE STORY REVOLVES AROUND MUCH MORE

THEY'RE LIGHT BOOKS IMHO SO GIVE IT A GO
DEFINITELY READ THE REST OF THE MADDADDAM TRILOGY BY ATWOOD YEAR OF THE FLOOD AND MADDADDAM FOCUS ON OTHER CHARACTERS BUT ARE EQUALLY AWESOME
I'M ON BOOK RIGHT NOW WITH TWO LONG ROAD TRIPS IN MY NEAR FUTURE I THINK I MAY HIT BEFORE THE NEW YEAR I LOVE GOODREADS AND THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN FUN BUT I FOUND MYSELF AVOIDING BIGGER BOOKS BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED THEY WOULD TAKE ME TOO LONG I DON'T THINK I'LL TRY FOR AGAIN UNTIL I'M RETIRED OR THE KIDS NEED LESS ATTENTION

NEXT YEAR I'M THINKING ABOUT CUTTING MY CHALLENGE NUMBER WAY DOWN AND FOCUSING ON THE CLASSICS AND NONFICTION BIOGRAPHIES I WANT TO READ GONE WITH THE WIND AND THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO I READ IT THIS YEAR BUT KIND OF BLEW THROUGH IT LOVED IT THOUGH THERE WAS ALSO A BRANDON SANDERSON THAT I STARTED BOOK REALLY GOT INTO AND THEN A CO-WORKER SHOWED ME HOW BIG IT WAS I HAD AN OH HOLY SHIT MOMENT AND DECIDED TO COME BACK TO IT I STARTED CHECKING PAGE NUMBERS ON MY BOOKS AFTER THAT LOL

I LOVED MOST OF THE CLASSICS I READ EXCEPT ALICE IN WONDERLAND AND BREAKFAST AT I READ THE SWANS OF 5TH AVE THOUGH AND I THINK IT MADE ME HATE CAPOTE SO NOW I'M HAVING ISSUES WITH HEARING HIS VOICE ATTITUDE COMING THROUGH AND ITS MAKING THE WHOLE BOOK ANNOYING

I HAD QUITE A FEW YA NOVELS IN THERE WHICH WERE LIKE TORTURE BUT I HAD TO READ THEM FOR WORK SO AT LEAST THEY BOOSTED MY NUMBER

THE CHALLENGE WAS FUN THOUGH I CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THROUGH
THE SELLOUT WAS SO GREAT ONE OF MY FAVORITES THIS YEAR AS WELL
THIS ALSO TURNED OUT TO BE PORN BUT I READ THE FIRST JOHN RINGO BOOKS ANYWAY

LOL HAHAHAHAHAHA
I WAS NEVER A READER THIS YEAR A FRIEND TURNED ME ON TO THE GENTLEMAN BASTARD SERIES BY SCOTT LYNCH THAT SPARKED SOMETHING IN I'M AMAZED THAT YOU'VE READ BOOKS I'M HAPPY WITH READING BOOKS THIS YEAR I'M CURRENTLY READING GOOD OMENS BY NEIL CAIMAN AND TERRY PRITCHETT SO IT WILL BE BOOKS I CAN SAY I'M VERY HAPPY I STARTED READING
ORYX AND CRAKE IS A FANTASTIC BOOK THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD WHICH IS THE FOLLOW UP TO THAT ONE IS GREAT AS WELL TURNS OUT I JUST REALLY LIKE MARGARET ATWOOD
THIS WILL PROBABLY BE BURIED BUT SCREW IT DO YOU FEEL THINK THAT READING THAT MANY BOOKS HAS CHANGED YOU MEMORY FOCUS ARE YOU ABLE TO DIGEST THE MATERIAL MORE QUICKLY OR DIFFERENTLY

OR IS IT JUST THAT READING HAS BECOME A MUCH BIGGER PART OF YOUR LIFE NOW
CONGRATS ON READING I READ BOOKS THIS WAS A HUGE GOAL FOR ME
GREAT POST CONGRATS ON YOUR READING LIST
I FELL WAY SHORT OF THIS YEAR'S GOAL DUE TO DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND COLLEGE KICKING MY ASS BUT YOU'VE INSPIRED ME TO TRY AGAIN NEXT YEAR AND AIM HIGHER THANKS OP
EDIT AUTOCORRECT FAIL
IN A YEAR IS PHENOMENAL SILLY TO ASK THIS BUT HOW MUCH TIME DO ONE NEED TO SPEND ON AN AVERAGE DAY FOR THIS MANY BOOKS IN A YEAR
WELL MMM HERE I AM WITH MY BOOKS FOR THIS YEAR
IMPRESSIVE AND INSPIRING I NEED TO GET OFF REDDIN
AUDIOBOOKS FTW THAT'S HOW I SMASH OUT A LOT OF READING

YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON I'VE COME ACROSS THAT ACTUALLY HAS HEARD OF ORYX CRAKE I LOVED THAT SERIES SO MUCH IT'S JUST PERFECTION REALISTIC EERIE FUNNY DEPRESSING AND ATWOOD DOESN'T TREAT THE READER LIKE AN IDIOT YOU REALLY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A LOT OF STUFF FOR YOURSELF

I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH SCI-FI IS YOUR BAG BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IAIN M BANKS OR SEARCH IAIN BANKS FOR HIS STUFF HE'S DEAD SET MY FAVOURITE AUTHOR AND I WAS SO DEVASTATED WHEN HE DIED HIS BOOKS ARE VERY CEREBRAL AND CLEVER AND MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING THE CULTURE BOOKS ARE AMAZING ACTION PACKED SCI-FI WITH GREAT MIND BENDING CONCEPTS GET ON IT
MY GOODREADS GOAL FOR THE YEAR WAS I HIT YESTERDAY AND YES I AM BRAGGING LOL
I DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR LIKE CATCH

HOW DARE YOU
READ MORE STEPHEN KING
GOOD FOR YOU MY BUNNY AND I HAVE JUST REDISCOVERED READING WE'RE FINALLY GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE OUR ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE IS COMING BACK AND WE HAVE A LOT OF READING TO CATCH UP ON THANK GOODNESS FOR LIBRARIES

ANYWAYS KEEP IT UP AND ROCK IT OUT READING IS AN AMAZING GIFT AND IT CAN GIVE YOU SO MUCH
WHAT WAS THE KEY TO GETTING THIS DONE
OK ONE QUESTION HOW DID YOU ACQUIRE ALL THESE BOOKS I IMAGINE NOT PHYSICAL COPIES BUT A KINDLE OR WHAT AND HOW MUCH DID IT ALL COST
THAT'S ONE BOOK EVERY DAYS CRAZY
JUST CURIOUS HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO READ SHOGUN IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY ISN'T IT QUITE LONG
WHAT DOES READING BOOKS TRANSLATE TO IN REAL TIME I READ THE FIRST BOOK OF ASOCIAL IN HOURS MIDNIGHT TO PAST NOON SO IF IT TAKES HALF A DAY TO FINISH ONE BOOK PROBABLY DAYS MORE OR LESS THAT'S LIKE OF YOUR YEAR
GOOD JOB I USED TO READ BOOKS EVERY YEAR WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS AN INTROVERT WITH NO SOCIAL LIFE LOL BUT NOW I HAVE TROUBLE BALANCING WORK WITH ALL THE OTHER HOBBIES I WANT TO DO AS WELL AS WANTING TO READ YOUR POST IS INSPIRATIONAL I WANT TO GET BACK TO WHAT I USED TO ACHIEVE
CONGRATS ON THE BOOKS AND REDISCOVERING FICTION I'M PLANNING ON GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION NEXT YEAR LOVE THAT TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST AND NATION ARE ON YOUR FAVORITES LIST
WHERE IS YOUR FAVORITE SPOT TO READ
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE GENE AN INTIMATE HISTORY IM READING IT NOW
I ALSO LEARNED THAT SIMILAR TO MY LIFE I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE MUCH OF THE SUPERNATURAL IN MY STORY I PREFER REALISM AND I REALLY ENJOY ADVENTURE AND SURVIVAL MOTIFS WHICH IS WHY I HAD BEEN READING A LOT OF THAT TYPE OF PREVIOUSLY

THE GREEN MILE

ORYX AND CRAKE

LOL WUT

EVER TRIED CLANCY AND LUDLUM POLITICAL SPY STORIES ARE INCREDIBLY FORWARD YOU CAN FIND A LOT OF WHATS HAPPENING NOW IN BOOKS WRITTEN YEARS AGO
AUDIOBOOKS ARE ANOTHER WAY TO GET A BIT OF EXTRA TIME WITH A BOOK YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY BE ABLE TO SAY IN THE CAR TO WORK IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP OR AT NIGHT WHILE FALLING ASLEEP

I WENT FROM READING ABOUT BOOKS A YEAR TO GETTING THROUGH ABOUT OR SO THANKS TO AUDIOBOOKS


ORYX CRAKE IS MY FAVORITE BOOK AND MARGARET ATWOOD IS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD ALSO NOT AS BUT DEFINITELY AS DYSTOMIC IS CHILDREN OF MEN BY PD JAMES REALLY ENJOYED IT AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
I LOVED THE SELLOUT SO SO SO MUCH AND NO ONE FELT THE SAME WAY IN MY CIRCLE OF BUDDIES THANKS SO MUCH FOR POSTING THIS I DIG YOUR LIST AND WANT TO CHECK OUT SHOGUN NOW
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE IT WAS THE FIRST BOOK I FINISHED AND THOUGHT DAMN THAT WAS ARTICLE IT'S SO INTRICATE AND PERFECT UGH
BUT I ALSO REALIZED THERE ARE SOME FAMOUS BOOKS THAT I DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR LIKE FAHRENHEIT SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE THE DISPOSSESSED

DON'T TELL R PRINTS
CONGRATS NICE LIST TOO LOTS OF PRITCHETT ALWAYS GREAT STEPHEN KING PIERCE BROWN DAN SIMMONS URSULA BEGUIN VERY NICE

R BOOKS DOES IT AGAIN

TOP WORK AMIGO HAVE BEEN MEANING TO CHECK OUT ORYX AND CRAKE FOR A WHILE NOW WILL DO

WHAT ARE YOUR FAVOURITE BOOKS
LOL SAD ME ONE OR 2 I GUESS I HAVING BEEN WATCHING TOO MUCH TV LATELY
AND I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT TO THE END OF YOUR POST NO OFFENSE
I AM CURRENTLY AT THE START OF MY THIS YEAR MY GOAL IS 2 BOOKS MONTH ON AVERAGE
PREEMPTIVELY I AM GOING TO SAY THIS POST IS MORE ABOUT MOVIES THAN BOOKS SO YEA DON'T HATE TOO MUCH I KNOW WRONG SUB BUT I FEEL IT WOULD BE A SIN NOT TO SAY IT

YOU MENTIONED THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO TWICE IN YOUR POST AND AS IT IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BOOKS BUT DEFINITELY FAVOURITE MOVIES I THOUGHT I WOULD TELL YOU TO GIVE THE MOVIE A SHOT

SPOILERS KINDA NOT REALLY BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE CRAZY

THERE ARE TWO MONTE CRISTO MOVIES BOTH GOOD AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT ENOUGH THAT THEY ARE WORTH WATCHING

ADDITIONALLY ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MOVIES ALONG THE SAME MOTIFS V FOR VENDETTA SPOILERS AGAIN NOT REALLY THE CHARACTERS IN THAT TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE MONTE CRISTO FOR A SCENE WHICH WAS COOL

YOU SAID YOU LIKE ADVENTURE HAVE YOU READ ANYTHING BY RAFAEL SABATINI THE SEA HAWK CAPTAIN BLOOD OR SCARAMOUCHE
SELF IMPROVEMENT IS A BIG THING FOR ME AND I TEND TO STEER TOWARDS BOOKS AIMED AT HELPING ME HACK MY LIFE MY QUESTION FOR YOU WOULD BE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE LEARNED OR HAVE BENEFITTED FROM BY READING THESE BOOKS THANKS FOR SHARING
HOW MUCH DO YOU REMEMBER OF THE BOOKS THAT YOU READ I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW READING THAT MUCH AFFECTS YOUR ABILITY TO RETAIN ALL OF THAT INFORMATION
I'M PROUD OF YOU MY READING CHALLENGE THIS YEAR WAS BUT I'M ALREADY HITTING SO I'M FEELING PRETTY SMUG IS MASSIVE CONGRATULATIONS
I WISH I COULD REACH A HUNDRED I'M ONLY AT HAHA
THIS IS GREAT KUDOS TO YOU

I'M JUST OVER FOR THIS YEAR MY RECORD BY FAR I WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH IN BUT HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR I'LL MAKE IT
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HOUSE OF LEAVES I STILL HAVE IT SITTING AROUND TRIED TO READ IT FOR A BIT BUT HAVEN'T GOTTEN BACK TO IT WAS PLANNING ON READING THE ENTIRE THING THIS YEAR BUT I HAVE A FEELING IT'LL TAKE ME A LOT LONGER THAN EXPECTED
I ALSO READ JOHN RINGO INSPIRED AT THE SAME POST BUT I STOPPED AT THE FIRST ONE I HAD A VERY SIMILAR REACTION TO THIS SUB LAST YEAR CONGRATS
I'M A VERY SLOW READER ON MY BOOK RIGHT NOW
PSHHH WISH I HAD TIME TO READ BOOKS A YEAR
I STILL CAN'T READ
HOW DID YOU FINISH SO MANY BOOKS DO YOU WORK SOCIALIZE LIKE NORMAL OR WHAT DID YOU SACRIFICE FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT
DOES LISTENING AUDIOBOOKS COUNT IF SO I'VE GONE THROUGH THIS YEAR SOON TO START MY SIXTH
I DIDN'T LIKE FARENHEIT EITHER I STARTED IT GOT ABOUT TWO CHAPTERS IN AND THOUGHT PEOPLE REALLY LOVE THIS PURPLE PROSE I CAN'T TAKE IT AND I PUT IT DOWN MAYBE I'LL GIVE IT A TRY SOME OTHER TIME BUT I MOSTLY EVER READ MINIMALIST FICTION BARE BONES DIRECT TO POINT FICTION I CAN'T STAND TOO MANY SIMILES METAPHORS

THE SELLOUT WAS ALSO AND INCREDIBLE BOOK I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN I LAUGHED OUT LOUD SO MUCH WHEN READING A BOOK
HOW DO YOU AFFORD SO MANY BOOKS I WOULD LOVE TO READ MORE BUT I WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE CHEAP ON KINDLE AND THERE JUST AREN'T ENOUGH GOOD ONES THAT GO IN THE DEALS
CONGRATS YOU MADE IT TO BRONZE LEVEL GREAT JOB FRIEND BOOKS RULE
I MANAGED TO READ BOOKS SO FAR BUT WHENEVER I LOOK AT THE LEAST I FEEL GUILTY LIKE I SOMEHOW CHEATED I MEAN I HAVE SOME GREAT BOOKS ON MY LIST BUT I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF CRAP LIKE STAR WARS NOVELS I CAUGHT MYSELF PICKING UP BOOKS BASED ON THEIR LENGTH AND NOT THEIR QUALITY JUST THINKING WELL I CAN READ THIS ONE FAST LET'S DO IT I'M NEVER DOING THIS TO MYSELF AGAIN NEXT YEAR I'M NOT DOING ANY LISTS GOALS OR READING CHALLENGES I'M FOCUSING ON READING FOR PURE PLEASURE OF IT
THIS HAS MOTIVATED ME TO ATTEMPT THE SAME THING NEXT YEAR I USUALLY GO THROUGH A LOT OF BOOKS GOT IN UNDER A MONTH BUT WOULD LIKE A CHALLENGE THAT WOULD GET ME TO GO OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE AND TRY A GREATER VARIATION OF FICTION

MY ONLY DOWNSIDE IS FINDING THE TIME TO READ WHEN WORKING FROM HOME I CAN READ FOR AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE BED WHEREAS IF I'M OUT ON CONTRACT THEN I'M SO TIRED THAT I MANAGE A PARAGRAPH OR TWO BEFORE FALLING ASLEEP IT'S TAKEN ME ALMOST WEEKS TO GET THROUGH PYRAMIDS BY TERRY PRITCHETT INSTEAD OF THE EXPECTED DAYS

I'VE BOOKMARKER YOUR READING LIST AND WILL USE THAT OR A VARIATION OF IT AND HOPEFULLY START ON DECEMBER

THANKS FOR THE MOTIVATION AND CONGRATULATIONS ON ACHIEVING YOUR GOAL
READING BOOKS IS LIKE MAKING LOVE IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES YOU FINISH PER YEAR OF COURSE

JESUS AFTER REALIZING I SPEND FAR TOO MUCH TIME IN ZEROTH I SET MYSELF A GOAL OF BOOKS AND I'M AWAY I WAS FEELING SUPER SMUG UNTIL THIS GOOD JOB
HEY CONGRATS ON THE BOOKS IF YOU LIKE REALISM AND SURVIVAL YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT NAT LIST OF BEST ADVENTURE BOOKS A FEW THAT I READ WERE THE WORST JOURNEY IN THE WORLD AND YOU MIGHT LIKE THEM
I DID THAT 2 YEARS AGO BY STARTING TO READ ALL THE AGATHA CHRISTIE NOVELS GOOD GRIEF IT WAS FUN TO DO THE HERCULE POIROT SERIES WAS JUST AWESOME
COUPLE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON YOUR STATED TASTES NIGHT-LIGHT AND WIND SAND AND STARS BOTH BY ANTOINE STREET EXUPERY AND THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING BY RUDYARD KIPLING
I'M GLAD TO SEE ANOTHER FAN OF THE GREEN MILE I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF STEPHEN KING FANS AND THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM IF YOU LIKE STEPHEN KING I WOULD SUGGEST A LITTLE DABBLE IN GATH GABRIEL SERIES FICTION AND HIS KEYS TO THE KINGDOM SERIES ALSO FICTION I DID ABOUT BOOKS THE OTHER YEAR AND HAVE SADLY DROPPED A LOT OF READING TIME FOR STUDIES BUT NOW I MIGHT TRADE OFF SOME PLAY TIME FOR READING TIME
IN I ENDED UP READING SOMEWHERE JUST SHY OF BOOKS ADMITTEDLY I SLOWED DOWN A BIT TOWARDS THE END

I'M A PRETTY FAST READER BUT I WAS SPENDING HOURS A DAY READING PLUS A FULL HOUR DAY SOMETIMES ON THE WEEKENDS MOST OF MY BOOKS WERE PRETTY LONG IN FACT I TOSSED A FEW IN THERE FROM THE DRESDEN SERIES JUST TO PAD OUT MY NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHORTER AND I TOSSED THE WHOLE BELGARIAD MALLOREAN SERIES BECAUSE I COULD COUNT IT AS BOOKS

IT WAS ALMOST EXHAUSTING TO READ THAT MUCH ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS ALMOST PANIC INDUCING WHEN A PAGE MONSTER WOULD KICK ME BEHIND SCHEDULE SO I WOULD DELIBERATELY FIND A SHORT BOOK OR EVEN A NOVELLA LIKE OF MICE AND MEN TO CATCH UP

I'M A PRETTY QUICK READER BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE READ BOOKS IN A YEAR I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS SHOOTING FOR A BOOK CHALLENGE THIS YEAR AND SHE'S ALMOST DONE SHE'LL REVIEW THREE OR FOUR BOOKS AT A TIME ON GOODREADS I DON'T KNOW I GUESS I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN GET THAT MUCH OUT OF THE BOOKS WHEN YOU ARE JUST TEARING THROUGH THEM AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TRYING TO PAD UP YOUR NUMBERS

I THOUGHT ABOUT DOING ANOTHER BOOK CHALLENGE BUT I DIDN'T WHILE I WAS HAPPY I GOT BACK TO READING SO MUCH LIKE I SAID SO MUCH OF IT FELT LIKE AN ABSOLUTE CHORE BY THE END
WHAT DIDN'T YOU LIKE ABOUT LOLITA
WHAT DIDN'T YOU LIKE ABOUT SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE I LIKE TO HEAR DIFFERENT OPINIONS NOT LOOKING TO JUDGE
WHAT ARE YOUR LEAST AV BOOKS IN EACH CATEGORY
FOR THOSE WHO JUST CAN'T FIND THE TIME THROW A BOOK ON THE TOILET AND READ WHILE YOU'RE ON THE CAN EVEN IF IT'S JUST A PAGE AT A TIME IT USUALLY GETS ME THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE BOOK AFTER WHICH WORLD-BUILDING IS USUALLY OVER THE INTERESTING BITS ARE STARTING TO HAPPEN AND I END UP READING THE REST IN ONE GO I DON'T FINISH SOME ABSURD NUMBER OF BOOKS IN A YEAR BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO IT'S ABOUT ENJOYING THE RIDE AND GETTING ACCESS TO ENTERTAINMENT STORYTELLING AND IDEAS I WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO
HOLY SHIT BOOKS HOW MANY PAGES DO YOU HIT A DAY


HOW DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY NOW THAT YOU'VE READ ALL OF THOSE BOOKS ANY LIFE PERSPECTIVE CHANGES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE
GREAT JOB ARE YOU STILL A STUDENT OR DO YOU HAVE A JOB

I'M A STUDENT AND I'M IN MY BOOK AT THE MOMENT I'M HOPING TO READ ABOUT BY THE END OF THE YEAR BUT I'M THINKING THAT WON'T HAPPEN

I WAS ACTUALLY AT EXACTLY BY THE END OF APRIL EXAM PERIOD IN JANUARY WAS GREAT FOR MY READING SO MUCH FREE TIME BUT I SLOWED DOWN A BIT THROUGH THE REST OF THE YEAR

AS I SAID GREAT JOB ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO THE SAME THE COMING YEARS
I WAS LITERALLY JUST ABOUT TO SEARCH FOR SOME GOOD BOOKS TO READ WHEN I SAW THIS POST I'VE ONLY READ THIS YEAR I THINK BUT ONE WAS DUNE SO THAT TOOK ME FOREVER

DOES ANYONE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION SIMILAR TO DUNE
IF YOU ARE INTO BOOKS WILL SEND YOU AN EMAIL EVERYDAY SITH LINKS TO DISCOUNTED EITHER DEEPLY OR FREE OF BOOKS YOU MAY LIKE AT THE SERVICE YOU USE SO FOR ME ITS KOBO AND AMAZON BUT CIRC THEY ALSO HAVE APPLE BOOKS GOOGLE BOOKS AMONG OTHERS
I ALWAYS LOVE TO LOOK UP MY WORD COUNT PER YEAR IT GIVES ME A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF MY PROGRESSION AS A READER I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT YOU HIT OP
THAT'S ONE BOOK EVERY DAYS THEY MUST ALL BE TERRIBLY SHORT
QUICK QUESTION SHOULD I COUNT AUDIOBOOKS I FINISHED QUITE A FEW OF THEM I DIDN'T READ THEM THOUGH SO I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WOULD INFLUENCE MY NUMBER READ THIS YEAR
CONGRATULATIONS THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT BOOKS IN YOUR LIST OF WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE RED RISING SERIES I PERSONALLY LOVED IT
THE GLASS CASTLE IS THE ONLY BOOK I READ IN HIGHSCHOOL I REMEMBER FANTASTIC BOOK
I THINK THETE IS A DOWNSIDE TO READING A LOT OF BOOKS OVER MANY YEARS AFTER AWHILE IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS NOTHING UNDER THE SUN THAT IS NEW WHEN A BOOK SHOWS UP THAT IS EITHER WRITTEN DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHERS OR THE CONTENT VIEWS OF THE AUTHOR ARE IDEAS I HAVE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THEN I SAVOUR THAT BOOK

MANY TIMES I FIND MYSELF WANDERING AND NOTICING STYLES OF LITERATURE OF CERTAIN AGES ITS MIND STIMULATING WHEN MOST BOOKS BEGIN TO LOOK LIKE COOKIE CUTTER NOVELS GIVES ME SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT BESIDES THE BOOK ITSELF
CHECK OUT THE REMAINDER OF JAMES ASIAN SAGA CHRONICLES THE PAST YEARS WITH AN INTERLACED STORYLINE THAT SEEMS TO FOLLOW ONE PARTICULAR ANCESTRY NOBLE HOUSE WAS MY FAVOURITE ESPECIALLY AFTER VISITING HK
I'VE TRIED TO HIT A HUNDRED BUT I ALWAYS LOSE STEAM IN THE FIRST MONTH I'LL HAVE GOTTEN ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE DONE THEN I JUST CAN'T KEEP UP THE PACE WHAT'S YOUR TRICK
THE LAST TIME I READ BOOKS IN A YEAR I COULDN'T READ SERIOUS WORKS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTERWARDS IT DIDN'T HELP THAT IT WAS FOR A PHD SO I WAS READING SOME HEAVY DARK STUFF THAT KIND OF SCARRED MY PSYCHE I'M BACK TO NORMAL NOW CONGRATS ON YOUR ACHIEVEMENT
QUALITY POST
GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT TWO QUESTIONS ON YOUR ACHIEVEMENT

AFTER YOU HAD READ A BOOK DID YOU REFLECT ON ITS PURPOSE OR ON ITS MEANING

2 ON AVERAGE YOU HAVE READ TWO BOOKS A WEEK HOW DID YOU MANAGE AROUND YOUR OBLIGATIONS WORK SPORTS FAMILY F COOKING LAUNDRY ETC
DELETED
GREAT WORK YOU INSPIRE ME TO DO THE SAME THINKING
GREAT WORK I FOUND GOODREADS OR ANY METHOD OF TRACKING YOUR READING PROGRESS HAS HELPED ME IN READING MORE THAN I USED TO SOMETHING ABOUT TRACKING YOUR PROGRESS AND SEEING ALL THE PROGRESS YOU'VE MADE MOTIVATES YOU TO READ MORE

I ACTUALLY SET A GOAL OF READING BOOKS OVER THE SUMMER WHICH I'VE ALREADY DONE I MIGHT TRY BOOKS NEXT YEAR
SPEED READING I WISH I COULD
HAVE YOU READ ANY OF ASIAN SAGA ASIDE FROM SHOGUN
I'M A VERY SLOW READER THAT'S WHY I LISTEN TO AUDIOBOOKS INSTEAD BUT IT STILL TAKES ME A LONG TIME TO FINISH AN AUDIOBOOK
HAD A LITTLE GIGGLE AT I ALSO LEARNED THAT SIMILAR TO MY LIFE I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE MUCH OF THE SUPERNATURAL IN MY STORY I FEEL THE SAME WAY CONGRATULATIONS ON REACHING YOUR GOAL KEEP ON READING
HOW DOES ONE MANAGE TO READ SO MUCH WHITE WORKING FULL TIME
WORKING GAMMING FULL TIME AND STARING AT A COMPUTER SCREEN ALL DAY LEAVING ME WITH DRY EYES DOES NOT FACILITATE READING MY GOAL WAS BOOK PER MONTH I WAS SUCCESSFUL UNTIL MARCH NOW I'VE BEEN ON HOLIDAY FOR A WEEK AND ALREADY READ TWO BOOKS

MIND YOU EVERYTHING I'VE READ ON REDDIN THIS YEAR COULD HAVE PROBABLY EQUATED TO ABOUT NOVELS SO I THINK THIS IS WHERE MY REAL PROBLEM LIES
WOULD YOU SAY THAT LISTENING TO AUDIOBOOKS IS SOMEWHAT EQUIVALENT TO READING I READ SOME ALOT OF BOOKS BUT DURING WORK AT A FACTORY AND DURING OTHER ACTIVITIES I'VE LISTENED TO PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF BOOKS WOULD OFCOURSE WANT TO BE ABLE TO READ MORE BOOKS ASWELL
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE HOURS FOR BOOKS INCLUDING SOME EPICS LIKE LONESOME DOVE AND COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
SHOGUN BEST HISTORICAL ROMANCE NOVEL FOR DUDES
TO CELEBRATE ALL OF THAT KNOWLEDGE DID YOU DRIVE YOUR LAMBORGHINI THROUGH THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS
YOU AND I SEEM TO HAVE SIMILAR TASTES IN BOOKS I'LL HAVE TO CHECK OUT SOME OF YOUR FAVORITES THAT I HAVEN'T TRIED
HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY READ I MEAN IS THERE SOME TECHNIQUE YOU USE TO READ THIS QUICKLY THERE ARE A FEW PAGE BOOKS ON YOUR LIST PERSONALLY I KNOW WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS HOUSE OF LEAVES IS TO READ THAT BOOK ALONE TOOK ABOUT A MONTH FOR ME TO GO THOUGH AND I EVEN SKIPPED SECTIONS IF I CAN GET 2 BOOK IN PER MONTH I FEEL LIKE AN ACCOMPLISHED SMART ASS SO I'M IN AWE OF YOUR GOD LIKE POWERS
I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT A TYPICAL DAY FOR YOU THE LAST YEAR LOOKS LIKE HOW MANY HOURS A DAY DID YOU SPEND READING DID YOU HAVE FREE TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE
WATCH THE MOVIE OF THE GREEN MILE
CLEVENGER MAN LOVE HIS STUFF DID YOU CHECK OUT DERMOPHORIA
DUDE DO YOU HAVE TIME FOR SOCIALIZING AND KEEPING UP WITH CURRENT EVENTS EXERCISE THAT IS SO MANY BOOKS HAHA
I SECOND HANDBOOK I RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE AND THEY'RE REALLY PUT OFF BY THE TITLE
DAMN THAT'S A LOT THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR I'VE KEPT A LIST AND HAD A GOAL OF BOOKS I WILL LIKELY HIT OR DEPENDING ON HOW BUSY I AM OVER THE HOLIDAYS WOULD KILL ME YOU MUST BE A PRETTY QUICK READER
YOU MUST READ THE NAME OF THE WIND IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE
CONGRATULATIONS

I WAS ABLE TO BEAT MY BOOK CHALLENGE AND HAVE READ A TOTAL OF BOOKS SO FAR I WOULD LOVE TO BE ALE TO READ BOOKS BUT I DON'T THINK MY DAUGHTER WOULD ENJOY BEING IGNORED THAT MUCH LOL
AND THERE GOES THE GOOD FEELING OF FINISHING MOST OF THE PRITCHETT DISC WORLD BOOKS IN THE LAST YEAR
REALLY
WHY DID YOU DISLIKE FAHRENHEIT JUST CURIOUS ITS ONE OF MY TOP BOOKS TO RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE WHO LOVE READING BECAUSE IT'S A TRIBUTE TO LITERATURE IN A WAY
FOR STARTERS I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M VERY IMPRESSED I'VE DROPPED OFF A LOT IN MY READING AND YOU'VE INSPIRED ME TO PERSEVERE I WON'T REACH BOOKS BUT ANY AMOUNT IS BETTER THAN NONE

ALSO I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THE GLASS CASTLE ON YOUR FAVORITES LIST MY GRANDMOTHER AUNT AND I ALL READ THIS BOOK WHEN IT CAME OUT I REMEMBER THINKING HOW CRAZY THAT FAMILY WAS WHEN I WAS READING IT IT WAS PRETTY EYE-OPENING FOR ME AND I THINK ABOUT REREADING IT ON OCCASION
MY GOAL WAS TO READ THEN I FOUND MYSELF WITH 2 JOBS AND VOLUNTEER POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WAS ONLY ABLE TO GET DOWN
HANDBOOK IS INCREDIBLE CLEVENGER IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES BUT HE DOESN'T WRITE ENOUGH DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ DERMAPHORIA
WHAT BOOKS DO YOU RECOMMEND READING FOR BEGINNERS I HAVE NOT READ A BOOK IN SEVERAL YEARS EXCEPT FOR NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND ONLINE ARTICLES I FEEL LIKE MY INTELLECTUAL PRODUCTIVITY IS NOT WHERE I NEED TO BE AND WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE THAT TIA
I JUST FINISHED LONESOME DOVE MYSELF A FEW WEEKS AGO IT'S A BLISSFUL READ FOR THE MOST PART THE DIALOGUE IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT AND THERE ARE A FEW LINES DOTTED THROUGHOUT THE STORY THAT ARE THE BEST I HAVE EVER HEARD IT'S JUST TOO LONG FOR MY SHORT ATTENTION SPAN BUT I AIN'T BLAMING LARRY FOR THAT

DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BOOKS I'VE READ THIS YEAR BUT IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T SURPASS OR GET ANYWHERE NEAR WE BOW DOWN AT YOU SMART ONE
WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS ON LONESOME DOVE KINDA A LENGTHY PICK FOR YOUR GOAL BUT I ALWAYS HEAR AMAZING REVIEWS
LIKE A LOT OTHERS HERE I ALWAYS GET DISTRACTED A LOT I'LL FINISH LIKE BOOKS BY THE END OF THE YEAR LOL
I HEAR YOU THERE I'M GETTING REALLY CLOSE TO BOOKS THIS YEAR AND MOST OF IT WAS BECAUSE I STARTED READING GRAPHIC NOVELS AND COMIC BOOKS NOT THAT THAT'S ALL I READ BUT IT CERTAINLY BUMPED UP MY NUMBERS A BIT AND NOW I FOUND A WHOLE NEW GENRE THAT I NEVER KNEW I WOULD LIKE LET ALONE LOVE IN SOME CASES
WHEN PEOPLE SAY HOW DO YOU FIND TIME TO READ I SAY JUST LIKE I FIND TIME TO BREATHE READ
I'M OF THE IGNORANT MILLENNIAL BELIEF THAT ANY GOOD BOOK WORTH READING WILL EVENTUALLY WILL GET TURNED INTO A MOVIE SO YEAH NETFLIX
WHEN DID READING BOOKS BECOME A FUCKING COMPETITION THIS FUCKING SUB
MAN I WAS ABOUT TO CALL YOU A DIRTY LIAR BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU READ BOOKS INSTEAD OF MY BAD HOBIE
I LOVE NABOKOV AND WOULD ACCOUNT HIM THE GREATEST PROSE FICTION WRITER EVER HE'S A BIT TOO GOOD A WRITER IN TRUTH BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW GOOD HE IS BUT LOLITA IS HIS WEAKEST GREAT NOVEL IMO

I VASTLY PREFERRED HIS EARLY NOVELLA ON THE SAME THEME THE ENCHANTER HIS MASTERPIECE IS PALE FIRE I'D EVEN TAKE SUPPOSEDLY MIDDLING EFFORTS LIKE DESPAIR BEND SINISTER AND THE DEFENCE AND ALL HIS SHORT STORIES BEFORE LOLITA THE LATTER IS UNDOUBTEDLY A GREAT BOOK BUT IT DIDN'T DELIVER THE SAME NABOKOVIAN FORCE AS ALL HIS OTHER STUFF

SUCH A SHAME THAT SUCH A GREAT WRITER IS BEST-KNOWN FOR HIS BOOK IMO I RARELY MENTION NABOKOV IN CONVERSATION AS I CRINGE WHENEVER PEOPLE SAY AS THEY ALWAYS DO IS HE THE ONE WHO WROTE LOLITA
NICE I PERSONALLY PREFER KEEPING TRACK OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BOOKS I'VE READ IN MY LIFE I HIT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR CURRENTLY AT PROBABLY GOING TO ROUND OUT THE YEAR AT
EXCELLENT ARTICLE PROGRAM INVESTED AND HAS ALREADY RECEIVED INCOME IN REVOLUTIONS THE MONEY GOES INTO YOUR HANDS
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND PREACHY BUT THAT LIST IS DOMINATED BY MALE AUTHORS I RECOMMEND DELIBERATELY SEEKING OUT MORE FEMALE AUTHORS AND OTHER MINORITIES TOO I STARTED DOING THAT A WHILE AGO AND IT'S A GOOD WAY TO BROADEN THE VARIETY OF WHAT YOU READ TWO SUGGESTIONS THE FIRST FIFTEEN LIVES OF HARRY AUGUST BY CLAIRE NORTH AND THE TIME WIFE BY AUDREY NIFFENEGGER
REMOVED
READING JUST TO TALLY AND POST ON R BOOKS
THAT'S NOT AN ACCURATE TITLE

QUEENS DOES HAVE SMALL SPECIALTY BOOKSTORES LIKE SPANISH LANGUAGE AND USED SHOPS JUST ONE MISCONCEPTION ABOUT THEIR ENDEAVOR NIKODEM AND CASTILLO WANT CLARIFIED FOR THE RECORD THEY ARE NOT OPENING THEIR STORE WHERE THE BARNES AND NOBLE USED TO BE BUT QUEENS LACK A SECOND PLACE LIKE THIS A BIG GENERAL PURPOSE BOOKSTORE WHERE YOU CAN WANDER FOR HOURS AND FANTASIZE ABOUT THE TYPE OF PERSON YOU D BE IF YOU COULD MANAGE TO READ EVERYTHING ON YOUR LIST

THERE'S ONLY ONE BIG BOOKSTORE IN QUEENS WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE
SO TO CLARIFY THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE BOOKSTORE IN QUEENS JUST NO BARNES AND NOBLE OR EQUIVALENT

AND THE WHOLE ARTICLE IS A LEAD-UP TO A LINK TO THE KICKSTARTER FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO OPEN A NEW ONE
THERE ARE LIBRARY BRANCHES
IT WAS REALLY SAD WHEN B N CLOSED THE QUEENS STORES THE ONLY SAVING GRACE FOR QUEENS RESIDENTS IS THE QUEENS PUBLIC LIBRARY IT IS A VERY GOOD SYSTEM BUT OF COURSE IT'S NOT A STORE
I'M IN QUEENS AND LIVE CLOSE TO ONE OF THE NOW CLOSED STORES WHICH BECAME A TARGET THE REASON IT CLOSED WAS THAT PEOPLE WERE USING IT AS A LIBRARY AND A KID DROP OFF WHILE MOMMY WENT SHOPPING IN THE NEARBY STORES

NOT LIKE PEOPLE STOPPED READING
CLICKBAIT AGAIN
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S ONE MORE THAN THE BRONX
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME NOT MANY LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS THERE EITHER
THIS IS THE SAME TRANSLATION I READ IN COLLEGE AND I ALSO FOUND IT TO BE VERY STIRRING IT IS A BEAUTIFUL SEGMENT OF A MUCH LARGER EPIC INTERESTINGLY THE FILM BAGGER VANCE WITH WILL SMITH AND MATT DAMON IS A RETELLING OF THE CITA I AM BEING COMPLETELY SERIOUS WHEN YOU'RE DONE GO WATCH IT AND SEE
THE CITA IS PART OF THE INDIAN EPIC MAHABHARATA YOU SHOULD CHECK THAT OUT WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED THE MAHABHARATA HAS A REALLY INTRIGUING COMPLEX STORY SPANNING MULTIPLE GENERATIONS BUT IS ALSO QUITE PHILOSOPHICAL
I BOUGHT A FEW HOLY PHILOSOPHICAL CULTURALLY IMPORTANT BOOKS ABOUT MONTHS AGO AND I FOUND THE CITA ONE OF THE MORE ENGROSSING READS OUT OF THE BUNCH WELL WORTH READING
THE CASE IS BEING APPEALED

THAT RIGHT THERE SHOULD TELL YOU THIS IS A MAJORITY UNETHICAL DECISION
SUPER UNETHICAL BUT IF THE BOOK DOES WELL IT WELL PROBABLY WORK OUT FOR HIM FINANCIALLY WHICH WILL ONLY ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO DO THIS SAME THING
DID HE ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING UNETHICAL ILLEGAL

LIKE REVEALING PRIVILEGED INFORMATION WITHOUT THE CLIENT'S CONSENT

IF SO DISBAR HIM AND TAKE AWAY HIS BOOK PROFITS

IF THERE WAS CONSENT ON THE PARTIES INVOLVED THE ONLY PROBLEM I SEE IS TAINTING A POTENTIAL JURY POOL FOR A RETRIAL

THEN AGAIN I'M NOT A LAWYER AND THIS JUST IS MY LAYMAN VIEW
AS A PROFESSIONAL MATTER MEANING AS A MATTER THERE'S NO OPTION HERE BUT TO PUNISH AS A LITERARY MATTER IT'S A SHAME MANY OF THE BEST STORIES THE MOST IMPROBABLE EVENTS REALLY HAPPENED CERTAINLY MANY OF THE MOST INTERESTING STORIES SO THE STOCK ANY CONNECTION TO ACTUAL PERSONS OR EVENTS IS COINCIDENTAL IS A DOUBLE LOSER
NO PUBLISHER WOULD TOUCH THIS

END OF CAREER
I THINK IF YOU LIKE A BOOK IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHO'S IT'S TARGETED TO THEY'RE GOOD BOOKS IF ANYTHING THE LAME THING WOULD BE TO AVOID READING SOMETHING YOU ENJOY BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID OF WHAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL THINK THE LAME THING WOULD BE MAKING YOUR FRIEND FEEL BAD ABOUT READING A BOOK ON THEIR PART YOU DO YOU
PERCY JACKSON IS ONE OF THOSE SERIES FROM MY MIDDLE SCHOOL EARLY HIGH SCHOOL DAYS THAT I REREAD EVERY FEW YEARS GREAT SERIES I LOVE THEM ALSO THERE'S NEVER ANYTHING WRONG WITH SOMETHING YOU ONCE LOVED NO SHAME
NOTHING IS LAME IF YOU HAVE A PASSION FOR IT

BE YOU
YOU'RE WHICH IS STILL PRETTY YOUNG AND YOU WORRYING ABOUT BEING TOO OLD TO ENJOY A YOUNG ADULT SERIES IS PROOF OF THAT NEVER FEEL GUILTY ABOUT READING SOMETHING YOU ENJOY AT I CRIED WHILE READING THE BOOK THIEF JUST ENJOY WHATEVER YOU WANT TO ENJOY
I WOULDN'T WORRY I'M IN MY AND I HAVE SEVERAL COWORKERS AROUND MY AGE WHO ARE OBSESSED WITH VARIOUS YA SERIES NOBODY THINKS ANYTHING BAD ABOUT IT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AS LONG AS YOU ARE HAVING FUN AND GETTING ENJOYMENT OUT OF READING THESE BOOKS
EVERY YEAR OR TWO I THE WIZARD IN RHYME SERIES I FIRST READ THEM AT LEAST THE FIRST TWO WHEN I WAS

WHO CARES IF IT'S LAME I LIKE THEM

NOT AT ALL READING IS ONE OF THE BEST JOY IN LIFE IF DR SEUSS MAKES YOU WANT TO READ THEN BY GOD READ
I'M QUITE A BIT OLDER THAN YOU AND STILL REREAD THE HARRY POTTER SERIES ONCE EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS

NEVER FEEL BAD OR EMBARRASSED BY READING
DUDE NUMBER PERCY JACKSON IS AN AWESOME SERIES AND I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE SCENES IN THE BOOK VIVIDLY
IM IN MY AND I REREAD BOOKS I LOVED AS A TEENAGER EVERY SO OFTEN READ WHAT YOU WANT TO BUDDY
THE OPPOSITE OF LAME IT'S COMFORT FOOD IN LETTERS AND NO CALORIES
I'M IN MY AND GET FLAK FOR REREADING THE HARRY POTTER SERIES CONSTANTLY AND I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT ANYONE THINKS BECAUSE I LOVE THOSE BOOKS

I SAY READ WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT SOCIETY WANTS TO PUT IT IN
AS A PERSON WHO DIDN'T READ THE FIRST ONE UNTIL HIS THIRTIES NOT AT ALL THEM BOOKS ARE DOPE
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE BOOKS AND I'M NOW I'M READING MAGNUS CHASE I GOT MY BF TO READ THEM AND HE LOVES THEM HE'S AND STILL WANTS TO REREAD THEM GO FOR IT
WHEN I FIRST READ THEM I LIKED TO THINK I WAS A DEMIGOD I'M HALF GREEK AND I HAVEN'T SEEN MY DAD IN YEARS MADE SENSE RIGHT
HEY I AM AND I READ HP BOOKS ONCE IN EVERY TWO YEARS OR SO ALSO I CAN START READING LOAR RIGHT NOW AND HAVE BEEN READING ALMOST EVERY YEAR SINCE I WAS
IT'S INTERESTING HOW OFTEN YOU SEE THREADS LIKE THIS I SUPPOSE THAT'S BECAUSE WE ATTACH A PART OF OUR IDENTITY TO WHAT WE READ

I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO READING THERE'S ONLY ONE RULE TO READ EVERYTHING IF YOU WANT TO READ YA GO FOR IT IF YOU WANT TO READ PHILOSOPHY DO THAT TOO NEITHER ARE BETTER OR WORSE

READ IT AND HAVE FUN

AMERICAN GODS BY NEIL CAIMAN HAS A SIMILAR CONCEIT AS WELL THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES
WELL I JUST REREAD AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE DELLORA BOOKS

I AM WAY ABOVE THAT READING LEVEL BUT STILL LOVED IT BEYOND FEELING

SOMETIMES IT IS NOSTALGIA SOMETIMES JUST REALLY ENJOYING A TROPE

IN SHORT READ WHAT YOU LIKE IF ITS TZOLKIN OR GRIFFITHS DOESN'T MATTER
IT IS LAME

IF I WAS YOUR FRIEND I WOULD JUDGE YOU
MY BEST FRIEND WHO IS IS SUPER INTO ALL OF THE RICK RIORDAN BOOKS WE DIDN'T KNOW THESE BOOKS AS MIDDLE SCHOOLERS ONLY AS ADULTS

IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER I'M CURRENTLY LISTENING TO THE LEMONY SNICKET AUDIO BOOKS I'M

IF YOU LIKE IT READ IT I GUARANTEE IT'S NO MORE LESS LAME THAN ANY OTHER BOOK
I'M HOW LAME IS IT THAT I'M READING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMETIMES YOU WANT SOMETHING LIGHT AND DISTRACTING INSTEAD OF MAKING EVERYTHING A PYNCHON OR DICKENS
HOW LAME IS IT OF ME TO REREAD THE PERCY JACKSON BOOKS AND TO BECOME OBSESSED WITH THEM AGAIN AT THE AGE OF

HALF AS LAME AS READING THEM AT I FAIL TO SEE HOW SOMETHING CAN BE LAME IF YOU ENJOY IT UNLESS YOU ARE USING SOME STRANGE VARIANCE OF THE WORD LAME AND ONLY HAS MEANING TO YOU

READ FOR YOURSELF NO ONE ELSE
I'M AND HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT PICKING UP THE COLLECTION SEVERAL TIMES
I'M ABOUT TO READ THE HARDY BOYS SERIES BOUGHT THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL COLLECTION OFF EBAY SO NO I HOPE NOT AND I'M
IT'S NOT LAME AT ALL I THE OUTSIDERS EVERY COUPLE YEARS AND I FIRST READ THAT ONE IN JR HIGH IT'S NOSTALGIA
NOT LAME AT ALL REREAD PERCY JACKSON TO YOUR CONTENTION DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT OTHERS WILL THINK
AND REMOISTENING THE HARRY POTTER AUDIOBOOKS RIGHT NOW I ONLY DISCOVERED PERCY JACKSON IN MY SOUTH

NEVER TOO OLD FOR THINGS YOU ENJOY
I WAS IN MY WHEN I READ HARRY POTTER IF SOMETHING IS GOOD WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE HOW OLD YOU ARE
IT'S NEVER LAME TO READ ANYTHING EVER
NOT AT ALL MY FRIEND I THINK NO MATTER WHAT AGE YOU ARE YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INDULGE IN WHATEVER BOOKS YOU'D LIKE AS LONG AS YOU'RE READING BECAUSE WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE NOWADAYS SIMPLY DON'T CARE FOR BOOKS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE PRETTY ESSENTIAL TO GROWING AND LEARNING AS A PERSON PLUS AJO IS KIND OF ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I'VE EVER READ AFTER LOAR AND GOT SO NO JUDGMENT HERE
DUDE PERCY JACKSON IS PRETTY FUNNY I'M ALSO I THINK I'VE REREAD THAT SERIES A COUPLE OF TIMES

SO LONG AS YOU'RE ENJOYING A BOOK IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU'RE READING WHETHER IT'S JUST DAMN RED RIDING HOOD THE FAMOUS ABSOIL CLASSICS LIKE LOLITA OR WAR AND PEACE BY LEO TOLSTOY SOME RANDOM FREE INDIE BOOK OR EVEN AN OLD ENCYCLOPEDIA I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS

AFTER ALL BOOK ENJOYMENT IS A SUBJECTIVE THING COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON A PERSONS PERSONAL TASTE THAN IF IT'S TARGETED FOR A SPECIFIC AGE OR IT'S A CLASSIC OR ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS OF ALL TIME
NOTHING WRONG WITH LIKING CERTAIN BOOKS
NOT LAME AT ALL
SOMEWHAT
IT IS AELLA LAME AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ASKING DEMONSTRATES THAT YOU KNOW THIS I KNOW IT'S HARD TO PUT CHILDISH THINGS AWAY AND BECOME AN ADULT BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT SOMETIME THERE ARE COUNTLESS BOOKS YOU'LL ENJOY JUST AS MUCH AND EVEN MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE AIMED MORE AT SOMEONE WITH MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE AND ALL THAT DWELLING ON YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL DAYS LIKE THIS IS IMO LIKE REFUSING TO MOVE ON AFTER A BREAKUP
PRETTY LAME
I'M LIKE THIS I WAS CONCERNED SEEING MY GOODREADS RATINGS ARE GENERALLY AND AND THINKING I'M TOO LENIENT ON BOOKS WHICH I PROBABLY AM BUT I ALSO INTENTIONALLY SET OUT TO READ BOOKS I KNOW I'LL ENJOY I READ REVIEWS AND SYNOPSES AND I USUALLY DON'T BOTHER WITH A BOOK IF I'M NOT GETTING HOOKED ON IT RIGHT AWAY I THINK WHEN I READ FOR PLEASURE I AM LESS CRITICAL AND FOCUS MORE ON WAS THE PLOT GOOD OR WAS THAT A NICE EXPERIENCE IF I THINK MORE CRITICALLY ABOUT THINGS I END UP RATING THE BOOK LOWER MOST TIMES BECAUSE I REALIZE OH HEY THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS LEFT UNRESOLVED OR I REALLY WISH THIS CHARACTER WAS BETTER DEVELOPED
DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY BAD YOU COULD JUST BE FINDING THINGS TO APPRECIATE IN EVERY BOOK WHICH JUST REFLECTS A POSITIVE OUTLOOK
IT'S NOT WRONG AT ALL I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE A SIGN THAT YOU AREN'T READING VERY WIDELY BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE FOR YOU I THINK THE KEY IS GOING BACK TO BOOKS WHEN YOU'RE READY FOR THEM
NUMBER MY THING THOUGH IS THAT I USUALLY ONLY READ BOOKS I WANT TO READ

READING IS FUN
I HATE MOST THINGS I READ

SHOCK HORROR I KNOW
I DON'T THINK IT'S A FLAW AT ALL I LIKE NEARLY EVERYTHING I READ IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I DO THINK IT'S A GOOD PRACTICE TO NOTICE THE DIFFERENT WAYS BOOKS MAKE YOU FEEL FOR INSTANCE I MAY LIKE A BOOK FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS IT WAS A BOOK THE SETTING INTRIGUED ME I IDENTIFIED WITH A CHARACTER IT MADE ME THINK ETC APPRECIATING A BOOK IS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH ENJOYING IT AND THEY DEFINITELY DON'T ALWAYS GO HAND IN HAND FOR ME
NO I THINK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING READ ON MY FRIEND
I ENJOY ALMOST EVERYTHING I READ AS WELL AND READ ACROSS A VARIETY OF GENRES WITH THE OCCASIONAL CLASSIC THROWN IN IF ANYTHING YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT
DO YOU THINK ENJOYING EVERYTHING YOU READ IS A SIGN OF A WEAK READER OR A FLAW AS A READER

YOU LUCKY DUCK

GIVE IT ANOTHER YEARS YOU WILL MATURE AS A READER AND THEN FINDING ENJOYABLE BOOKS WILL BECOME A PROBLEM
OF THE NEAR BOOKS I'VE READ THIS YEAR THERE'S ONLY BEEN TWO I DIDN'T LIKE JUST FOR THE LOVE OF HATING I'LL NAME THEM BOTH HAUNTED BY PALAHNUK WHICH WAS AWFUL AND THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF CAVALIER AND CLAY WHICH JUST WASN'T GOOD
THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME IN MY EARLY WHERE I DIDN'T READ ANYTHING BUT GOING BACK AND CREATING A LIBRARY MADE ME REALIZE HOW MUCH I'D BEEN MISSING OUT ON AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT I UNDERSTOOD A LOT OF TEXTS NOVELS MUCH BETTER THAN WHEN I'D FIRST READ THEM AS A TEEN

THIS IS ALSO WHY I LIMIT MYSELF TO CERTAIN GENRES AND SERIES AMONG OTHER DEMANDS PLACED ON MY TIME I TEND TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS WORKS WHERE I KNOW JUST FROM A CURSORY GLANCE OF THE COVER SUMMARY THAT IT WILL BE WORTH PICKING UP AND SEEING THROUGH TO THE END

THAT SAID I'M ALSO A HARSH CRITIC MY GOODREADS PAGE CAN ATTEST TO THAT
RIGHT AND WRONG IS NOT A USEFUL WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT BUT IF YOU LIKE EVERYTHING YOU READ YOU MIGHT BE MISSING OUT ON THINGS NEARLY ALL BOOKS HAVE POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT THEM AND NEARLY ALL BOOKS HAVE NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT THEM IF YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE NEGATIVE THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT BE READING AS CRITICALLY AS YOU COULD BE

OF COURSE THIS RESPONSE IS ASSUMING THAT A PART OF READING IS TO CHALLENGE YOURSELF AND LEARN AND BE CRITICAL IF YOUR GOAL IS ONLY ENJOYMENT THAN YOU HAVE NO REASON TO CHANGE YOUR APPROACH
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT BUT FOR ME READING IS A LEISURE ACTIVITY THAT'S NOT TO MEAN I DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUS BUT RATHER I CHOOSE TO SPEND A GOOD AMOUNT OF THE PRECIOUS AMOUNT OF FREE TIME I HAVE READING THEREFORE I'M GOING TO READ BOOKS THAT I BELIEVE I WILL LIKE THAT MEANS MOST OF MY TIME IS SPENT READING MYSTERY THRILLERS HISTORICAL FICTION SOME SCIFI FANTASY AND HISTORY NONFICTION INCLUDING BIOGRAPHIES OF HISTORIAL FIGURES

THEREFORE MOST OF WHAT I READ I TEND TO LIKE I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES ME A FLAWED OR BAD READER BUT RATHER JUST A READER WHO APPROACHES THIS HOBBY WITH A DIFFERENT GOAL MINDSET OF WHAT I HOPE TO GAIN OUT OF READING COMPARED TO OTHERS MY FIRST GOAL IS ENTERTAINMENT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I DON'T READ BOOKS THAT ENGAGE OR TEACH ME MANY DO BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I WANT TO HAVE FUN AND ENJOY MY TIME READING
WHILE I WOULDN'T SAY I ENJOY NEARLY EVERYTHING I READ THE MAJORITY OF MY GOODREADS RATINGS ARE ALSO STARS PRIMARILY BECAUSE IF I'M NOT ENJOYING A BOOK I'LL STOP READING IT AND REMOVE IT FROM MY GOODREADS PAGE I DON'T GIVE PARTIAL CREDIT MARK BOOKS AS READ IF I DIDN'T FINISH PERSONALLY SO I WOULDN'T GIVE A DTF ONE STAR OR ANYTHING THE EXCEPTION HAS BEEN BOOKS FOR MY BOOK CLUB WHICH I ALWAYS TRY TO FINISH OR SOMETHING I WAS ENJOYING UP UNTIL THE VERY END AND THEN THE AUTHOR MADE A DECISION THAT I DIDN'T LIKE
INTERESTINGLY I VIEW MYSELF AS ALMOST A COMPLETE OPPOSITE AS A READING TYPE I VERY RARELY FIND A BOOK THAT I FIND WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENJOYABLE AT THE MOMENT I AM READING PLEASURE BY GABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO I DO THINK THAT THE BOOK IS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND TRANSLATED AND DOES CAPTURE A CERTAIN LIFESTYLE OF A PARTICULAR SOCIAL CLASS IN A WORLD THAT DOES NO LONGER EXIST BUT I FIND THAT LIFESTYLE VERY SHALLOW THUS MAKING THE BOOK MELODRAMATIC AT TIMES EVEN DISTURBING I EVEN THOUGHT THAT I LEAVE IT UNFINISHED AND MOVE ON BUT I GUESS I HAVE A SOME SORT OF ODD SENSE OF DUTY TO FINISH THE BOOKS I HAVE STARTED
DO YOU THINK ENJOYING EVERYTHING YOU READ IS A SIGN OF A WEAK READER OR A FLAW AS A READER

I HOPE NOT BECAUSE THIS IS ME I EVEN HAVE AN ENGLISH LITERATURE DEGREE

IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT THAT'S ALMOST BOOKS SINCE THEN SINCE I TRULY DISLIKED SOMETHING I READ PLENTY OF BOOKS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN AMBIVALENT ABOUT BUT I WAS GLAD I READ THEM NONETHELESS

I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE JUST GOTTEN GOOD AT SELECTING BOOKS FOR MYSELF OR IF I'M JUST MORE EASY GOING THAN OTHERS
THIS MAKES ME THINK OF THE FOR THE PODCAST THE SPORTFUL IT'S NOT FOR FOODIES ITS FOR EATERS THE ANALOGY BEING THAT A FOODIE IS GOING TO BE PARTICULAR AND HAVE THIS INTRICATELY AURATED TASTE OH I'M SUCH A FOODIE I ONLY LIKE AUTHENTIC TACOS YOU PEOPLE WHO PUT SOUR CREAM ON A TACO ARE SO WEIRD AN EATER EATS WHAT TASTES GOOD THAT MIGHT BE ONLY THE MOST AUTHENTIC TACOS OR IT MIGHT BE ANY GOOD TASTING TACO

THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT TO BE A GOOD READER YOU NEED TO PIGEONHOLE YOURSELF INTO A SPECIFIC TYPE OF BOOK


I AM SIMILAR I DON'T NECESSARILY LOVE EVERYTHING I READ BUT I'M NOT AS FREQUENTLY FILLED WITH THE KIND OF RAGE AND HATRED OTHERS SEEM TO EXPERIENCE I THINK ONLY A HANDFUL OF BOOKS HAVE MADE ME THINK WTF DID I JUST READ I CAN ONLY THINK OF OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

WITH RESPECT TO GOODREADS I SOMETIMES WONDER IF THE SOCIAL VOTING ASPECT INSPIRES PEOPLE TO BE OVERLY CRITICAL FOR ATTENTION IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS SOMETIMES MORE ABOUT WRITING THE REVIEW AND GETTING LIKES THAN IT IS ABOUT JUST READING THE BOOK JUST MY TWO CENTS
I WISH I HAD YOUR PROBLEM I READ BOOKS THIS YEAR AND THUS FAR TRULY LOVED ABOUT OF THEM THE REST WERE AVERAGE OR I HAD TO PUT DOWN
I HONESTLY JUST NOTICED THIS IN MYSELF A COUPLE MONTHS AGO I JUST FINISHED THE SECOND EXPANSE BOOK AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT EVERY BOOK I HAVE EVER FINISHED I HAVE REALLY REALLY LIKED

THERE ARE A COUPLE EXCEPTIONS AND IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T LIKE THE BOOKS ITS JUST I FIND THE WRITING MEDIOCRE BUT STILL LOVE THE STORY ETC

I FIND IT A BIT STARTLING REALLY
PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK SO I'M A PRETTY PERSON IN TERMS OF COMPLAINTS NOT ANALYSIS AND I TEND TO ENJOY MOST MOVIES BOOKS AND TV SHOWS I WATCH IT'S JUST THE WAY I AM I LIKE TO LOOK FOR THE GOOD IN EVERYTHING AND TO APPRECIATE THE WORK BASED ON THE CONTEXT AND THE CREATOR'S GOALS I EAST I'M NOT GONNA JUDGE THE AVENGERS ON THE SAME CRITERIA AS ANGRY MEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE WILDLY DIFFERENT GOALS

I THINK IT CAN BE A FLAW WITH READING OCCASIONALLY JUST BECAUSE I READ FOR PLEASURE SO I MIGHT MISS SOME STUFF BUT THE PAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN TRYING TO READ MORE SLOWLY AND TAKE MY TIME WITH THE WORDS AND THE STORY AND THAT HAS HELPED IN TERMS OF DIGGING DEEPER INTO STUFF BUT I STILL ENJOY PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I READ LIFE IS TOO SHORT
ITS LIKE MUSIC SURE I HAVE PREFERENCES AND TASTES BUT IF IT WAS COMPETENTLY COMPOSED THEN I WILL ENJOY IT
NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS IN THE SLIGHTEST IF YOU'RE ENJOYING YOURSELF WHY SHOULD THAT BE WRONG SOME PEOPLE ARE CRITICAL OF EVERYTHING AND SOME PEOPLE AREN'T VERY CRITICAL NEITHER IS WRONG ALTHOUGH CRITICAL PEOPLE TEND TO WANT EVERYONE ELSE TO SEE THINGS AS THEY DO DON'T LET THEM BRING YOU DOWN
I TEND TO ENJOY MOST THINGS I READ TO THE END BUT I'M ALSO A VERY CRITICAL PERSON SO SOMETIMES I'M READING TO THE END OF THE BOOK TO ENJOY BEING CRITICAL IF THAT MAKES SENSE ALSO MAKES ME SOUND A BIT LIKE A JERK I SUPPOSE BUT I KNOW THAT I CAN'T MAKE ARGUMENTS AGAINST A BOOK IF I'VE NEVER READ IT

MOST OF THE TIME I'M READING FOR ENJOYMENT SO IF I DON'T LIKE THE BOOK WHY CONTINUE READING IT MOST BOOKS I CAN FIND SOME REDEEMING FACTOR IN EVEN IF IT'S LEARNING SOMETHING ABOUT MY READING HABITS
WITHOUT EXAMPLES IT'S HARD TO SAY IF THIS IS PROBLEMATIC OR NOT IF YOU READ A LOT OF CLASSICS AND YOU LIKE ALL OF THEM GOOD FOR YOU IF YOU READ A LOT OF JAMES PATTERSON AND YOU LIKE ALL OF THEM IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE MOST OF HIS BOOKS ARE CRAP

I'VE READ BOOKS SO FAR THIS YEAR AND I'VE ONLY RATED BOOKS STARS THE VAST MAJORITY ARE EITHER OR AVERAGE

ALSO ENJOYMENT ISN'T THE SAME AS THE SAME AS THE BOOK BEING GOOD I'VE ENJOYED MANY BOOKS THAT I CAN RECOGNIZE ARE OBJECTIVELY CRAPPY I'M READING A BOOK LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S EXCITING AND TECHNICAL BUT EXTREMELY SHALLOW SO I'M PROBABLY GOING TO END UP GIVING IT A UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING STUNNING OR CLEVER ABOUT THE ENDING THAT BUMPS IT UP TO A I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY WAY IT'LL GET A

ETA IT'S CALLED LOCKOUT BY JOHN J NANCE AND I'D TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT I'D RECOMMEND ALL OF HIS BOOKS THEY'RE FUN
THE DISCWORLD SERIES BY TERRY PRITCHETT

AUTHOR SHOW

THE FANTASY WORLD HE CREATES IS MADE TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THE REAL WORLD BUT AS IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT IT THROUGH A FANHOUSE MIRROR THEY'RE FUNNY AND WITTY AND HAVE TWISTS YOU DON'T SEE AND ON SECOND READINGS YOU CAN SEE THE HINTS TO THE TWISTS THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE THE FIRST TIME THEN WHEN YOU READ ANOTHER BOOK YOU FIND CALL BACKS TO HIS EARLIER WORKS NEW READERS THAT START IN THE MIDDLE GET THE MOST OF THAT I GUESS

I REREAD THOSE BOOKS A LOT MY FAVOURITE CHARACTERS ARE IN THE WATCH BUT THE OTHER BOOKS HAVE GREAT STORIES TOO CONFESSION MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE DISCWORLD WAS THE PLAYSTATION GAME SO WHEN I FOUND THE BOOKS I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABOUT THE GAME I WAS A KID
FOUNDATION SERIES BY ASIMOV STARTED IT YEARS AGO AND AM NOW READING AGAIN VERY NICE EXPERIENCE HOPE I STAY ALIVE LONG ENOUGH TO FORGET IT AND READ IT A THIRD TIME
THE KING-KILLER CHRONICLE
ONE OF THE THEM IS THE WIZARD OF OZ SERIES

THEY'RE SO IMAGINATIVE FANTASTICAL AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE NARKY FUNNY DARK WEIRD AND BIZARRE I THINK THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED A LOT TO FANTASY WRITING IN GENERAL AND THEY DO NOT GET THE MODERN ATTENTION THEY DESERVE THE CHARACTER LANDS ARE ALL WONDERFULLY THOUGHT OF AND IT'S ALWAYS A JOY TO READ
THE MISBORN SERIES JUST HIT ME ON SO MANY LEVELS WHEN I FINISHED THE LAST BOOK I HAD READ FANTASY BEFORE BUT WASNT HUGE INTO IT THEN I READ THE MISBORN SERIES AND WAS IN AWE
THE DARK TOWER SERIES I'VE LITERALLY JUST PULLED THE GUNSLINGER OFF MY SHELF READY FOR TOMORROW TO START MY 4TH OR 5TH OF IT NOT SURE WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE SERIES I STILL REMEMBER LYING OUT IN THE GARDEN ON A WARM DAY READING THE FINAL COUPLE CHAPTERS OF BOOK 7TH BOOK LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY AND MY MEMORY IS FUCKING AWFUL
OBLIGATORY ANSWER OF HARRY POTTER

BUT FOR THE SAKE OF VARIETY I'LL ALSO LIST THE CAT WHO SERIES BY LILLIAN JACKSON BRAUN I'VE READ ALL OF THEM AND THOUGH IT'S SILLY AND CHEESY CATS WHO HELP SOLVE CRIMES I JUST REALLY ENJOYED THE SERIES
THE WHEEL OF TIME ROBERT JORDAN
FOR ME IT IS DEFINITELY THE GUIDE TO THE GALAXY BY DOUGLAS ADAMS NEVER HAS A BOOK SERIES MADE ME LAUGH WONDER AND THINK AT THE SAME TIME ESPECIALLY WITH SUCH COMEDIC INTENSITY ALL BOOKS JUST TAKE YOU INTO A PSYCHEDELIC NIGHTMARE IN WHICH YOU CANNOT PUT DOWN I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY WHO HAS TIME AND THE ABILITY TO READ
A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE
HARRY POTTER

I REREAD THE ENTIRE SERIES EVERY YEAR SINCE THEY FIRST CAME OUT I'M IT IS JUST AS MAGICAL AND MOVING EVERY TIME THROUGH
HIS DARK MATERIALS

IT CONTAINS EVERYTHING BLOODY INCREDIBLE
THE OLD KINGDOM BY GARTH NIX AND EQUALLY PLEASING TO READ WAS ALWAYS HIS DARK MATERIALS BY PHILIP PULLMAN BOTH ARE CONSIDERED YOUNG ADULT SERIES BUT THEY BOTH DEAL WITH MATURE CONTENT AS WELL
THE LIONESS QUARTET BY AMORA PIERCE I'VE BEEN READING IT COMPULSIVELY SINCE I WAS AND I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH
MALAYAN WITHOUT DOUBT IT WOULD BE SERIES I WOULD CHOOSE TO READ THE REST OF MY LIFE IF I HAD TO PICK ONE IT GOT IT ALL ENDLESS MYSTERIES LAUGHS OUT LOUD TEARS IN PUBLIC PROFOUND REGARDING HISTORY RELIGION PHILOSOPHY AND COMPASSION
THE RIFTWAR SAGA BY RAYMOND E FEIST
HIGH FANTASY I EAST MAGIC DWARVES ELVES AND ALIENS EXCELLENT WORLD-BUILDING CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE


THE MOTHERLAND SERIES BY TAD WILLIAMS
THE PREY SERIES BY JOHN SANDFORD EVEN AFTER BOOKS THESE POLICE PROCEDURALS ARE STILL ENTERTAINING ME AND KEEPING ME UP UNTIL THE WEE SMALL HOURS
HYPERION CANTOS
THE SANDMAN BY NEIL CAIMAN IT IS THE STORY OF AN ANTHROPOMORPHIC PERSONIFICATION OF DREAMS IT'S ALSO A STORY ABOUT PEOPLE WHOSE DREAMS HE LORDS OVER AND WHO ARE ALSO THE DREAMERS HE SERVES I FIND IT RATHER HARD TO PUT INTO WORDS THE SCOPE OF THIS STORY BECAUSE IT HAS SO MANY THINGS THAT THE WRITER MANAGED TO WRAP NEATLY AT THE END

OH GOSH I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE ANYONE WRITE ABOUT STEPHANIE PLUM HERE I USED TO READ THE SERIES AND WHILE MY INTEREST HAS WANED SHE AND THE OTHER CHARACTERS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART
I HAVE SEVERAL FAVORITE SERIES BUT BASED ON YOUR CRITERION OF GOING BACK TO TIME AND AGAIN I WILL NOTE THREE

THE LONESOME DOVE SERIES BY LARRY MCMURTRY

THE LORD OF THE RINGS SERIES BY J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN

THE SERIES BY PATRICK
THE RABBIT ANGSTROM NOVELS BY UPDIKE
YEAR OF THE RAT BY MURAKAMI
THIS WILL BE AN UNCONVENTIONAL ANSWER ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S NOT A SERIES IN THE TYPICAL SENSE MY FAVOURITE SERIES IS THE CYCLE OF NOVELS BY EMILE ZOLA I JUST LOVE WHAT HE DID WITH THEM IN CAPTURING FRENCH SOCIETY AND CULTURE DURING THE SECOND EMPIRE OF FRANCE FOR THE MOST PART THE BOOKS TAKE PLACE BETWEEN
THE AMELIA PEABODY MYSTERIES BY ELIZABETH PETERS I THEM EVERY FEW YEARS ONCE MOST OF MY MEMORY OF WHO THE KILLERS WERE HAS FADED BUT REALLY I JUST READ THEM FOR THE CHARACTERS ESPECIALLY PEABODY BECAUSE THEY'RE WONDERFUL
THE BLACK JEWEL TRILOGY BY ANNE BISHOP THE FIRST TIME YOU READ IT YOU ARE THROWN IN THE DEEP END OF THE POOL ONLY AT THE END OF BOOK THREE I HAD A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD IT'S REALLY DURING REREAD THREE THAT YOU NOTICE ALL THE SMALL HINTS TO THE STORY BECAUSE THE SECOND TIME YOU'RE STILL GAINING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD
I REALLY LIKE SERIES WITH AMAZING ELABORATE WORLD BUILDING AND THIS SERIES IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE ALONG WITH A GREAT STORY
HARRY POTTER I READ IT ABOUT EVERY YEAR AND A HALF

I STARTED READING THEM WHEN I WAS AND I'M NOW I MOSTLY READ IT FOR NOSTALGIA BUT I TRULY LOVE THE WORLD SHE BUILT THERE ARE SOME FLAWS WITH HER WORLD BUT TO ME THEY ARE SO MINOR COMPARED TO EVERYTHING ELSE I LOVE THAT THE MAIN THEME OF THE BOOKS IS DEATH THE BOOKS ARE FOR CHILDREN AND DEATH IS OFTEN SEEN AS A MORE ADULT TOPIC WHEN IN REALITY IT ISN'T SHE HANDLES IT TASTEFULLY AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT ISN'T SHOVED IN YOUR FACE

THE CHARACTERS ARE GREAT NO ONE IS A MARY SUE GARY STU EACH ONE HAS THEIR OWN FLAWS AND STRENGTHS

LASTLY SOME OF QUOTES HAVE REALLY STUCK WITH ME

JOHN DIES AT THE END TRILOGY THIRD NOT OUT YET NOT MY FAVORITE BUT WORTH A MENTION
HAVE TO BE DARK TOWER SEEING AS HOW I'VE IT THE MOST
OKAY YOU MADE ME BRAVE WITH YOUR ADMISSION OF LOVE FOR THE STEPHANIE PLUM SERIES I CONFESS I LOVE THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS TRILOGY BY CASSANDRA CLARE
I WISH STORMTIGHT ARCHIVE WAS COMPLETE AS THAT WILL LIKELY BE MY FAVORITE MOST OF MY FAVORITES HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BUT I'LL GO WITH THE GENTLEMAN BASTARDS ALWAYS A FAN OF THE ROGUE ASSASSIN BASED BOOKS
YEAH I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY HARRY POTTER I'M NOT UNIQUE AND THAT'S OKAY HARRY WILL ALWAYS HAVE A VERY SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART AND I'LL NEVER GET TIRED OF IT
HONORABLE MENTION TO HIS DARK MATERIALS WROTE MY SENIOR PAPER FOR MY UNDERGRAD ON IT
SOMEONE ALREADY POSTED MY TOP FAVORITE BOOK SERIES DISCWORLD BY TERRY PRITCHETT BUT THE SECOND ON MY LIST IS HIS MAJESTY'S DRAGON BY NAMHOI NOVAK

IT'S AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE WHERE THE NAPOLEONIC WARS ARE BEING FOUGHT BUT THE MILITARIES ALL HAVE AERIAL DRAGON CORPS THE DRAGONS ARE INTELLIGENT CREATURES AND THE SERIES TAKES YOU ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT CULTURES AND HOW THEY INCORPORATE OR DON'T DRAGONS INTO THEIR LIVES
I LOVE RICK PERCY JACKSON AND THE OLYMPIANS SERIES AS WELL AS THE FOLLOW-UP HEROES OF OLYMPUS SERIES RIORDAN HAS CREATED A SORT OF LITERARY UNIVERSE BASED ON DIFFERENT MYTHOLOGIES AND IT'S AMAZING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIS WORK
I'M REALLY LOVING THE WITCHER SERIES BY ANDRZEJ SAPKOWSKI IT MIGHT NOT BE AS BIG OF A FANTASY MASTERPIECE AS SAY THE LORD OF THE RINGS BUT IT IS VERY ENTERTAINING AND IT IS EASY TO GET INTO IMO
THE ENGELSFORS TRILOGY BY MATS STRANDBERG AND SARA ELFGREN IT'S A YA FANTASY SERIES ALMOST A CROSS BETWEEN HARRY POTTER AND BUFFY BUT IT BLEW ME AWAY THE THOUGHT THE HEART THE NUANCED CHARACTERS THAT YOU CONNECT DEEPLY WITH

I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY LIKE KATHARINE DEBERRY SERIES
MY PERSONAL FAVORITE SERIES IS THE BLOODY JACK SERIES BY LINE A MEYER IS IT THE MOST LITERARY IS IT CRAZY HISTORICALLY ACCURATE NO ON ALL COUNTS BUT THE ROLLICKING ADVENTURE FILLED TALES OF LIFE BOTH ON AND OFF THE HIGH SEAS HAVE ENTRANCED ME SINCE I WAS IN 8TH GRADE THE FACT THAT JACKIE WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED TO BE BASICALLY HELPED REEL ME IN WHO DOESN'T LOVE A HEROINE FULL OF SPUNK AND WIT SOME PEOPLE GO BACK AND THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS ANNUALLY I BLOODY JACK

FROM WHAT I CAN UNDERSTAND THEY'RE KIND OF A YOUNG ADULT VERSION OF THE SERIES WHICH I'VE STARTED READING AND AM LOVING THUS FAR
NOT COMPLETE YET BUT KING-KILLER BY ROTHFUSS
THAT I COULD GO BACK TO AND READ ANY TIME

HMM OF COURSE I THINK HARRY POTTER WOULD HAVE TO BE UP THERE BUT ALSO JULIAN GALACTIC MILIEU TRILOGY SAGA OF THE EXILES SERIES HAVE READ THOSE SO MANY TIMES AND GINN THE RIFTER SERIES
THE FIRETHORN TRILOGY BY SARAH MICKLE ALTHOUGH THE THIRD ONE ISN'T OUT YET SO I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE
HARRY POTTER IS THE ONLY BOOK SERIES THAT I HAVE AND I HAVE IT OVER TEN TIMES
THOSE ONE BOOKS FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT YOU CHOSE YOUR OWN DESTINY AND PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS ENDED UP DYING THOSE WERE THE BEST
TALES OF THE OFORI
THE GREY MAN NOVELS INCREDIBLE ACTION WELL WRITTEN EXCELLENT STORIES MARK GREANEY DOES A FANTASTIC JOB WITH THIS ONGOING SERIES AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS ASSASSIN THRILLERS
BROKEN EMPIRE IT WAS JUST SO MUCH FUN READING THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE BAD GUY VILLAIN JORGE IS JUST SO RUTHLESS AND IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN A HERO
EASILY MISBORN TRILOGY THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY ALONE

I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER READ ANYTHING THAT JUST BLEW MY MIND AWAY WITH THE WELL-DONE RED HERRINGS THE CHEKHOV GUN AND THE DAMN ENDING

THAT FUCKING ENDING NOTHING HAS ME FEEL HAPPIER SADDER AND COMPLETELY SATISFIED IN HOW A BOOK ENDED THAN MISBORN TRILOGY
BRAD SCOT HARVATH SERIES ARE AN AWESOME SET OF BOOKS
WELL AMONG DETECTIVE BOOKS DALZIEL AND PASCOE SERIES BY REGINALD HILL AND ALSO THE SHORT SERIES FEATURING JOE SHIPSMITH BY THE SAME AUTHOR
MINE ARE PROBABLY MORE PERSONAL THAN POPULAR BUT

THE DARK IS RISING SERIES BY SUSAN COOPER I WISH MORE PEOPLE WOULD READ THIS LONG BEFORE HARRY POTTER BECAME SUCH A SENSATION THERE WERE GREAT YA FANTASY WRITERS GETTING LITTLE ATTENTION LIKE HER LLOYD ALEXANDER

THE BELGARIAD MALLOREAN BY DAVID EDDINGS BOOKS BETWEEN THEM I STARTED READING IN 6TH GRADE I FINISHED THE LAST AND CRIED MY FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE AND I COULD PICK ANY OF EM UP TODAY AND STILL IMMEDIATELY REMEMBER THEM
GUIDE TO THE GALAXY
I JUST STARTED THE SERIES EARLY THIS YEAR AND I'M ALREADY SCOURING AMAZON FOR A COPY TO REREAD
I COULD SAY THE DARK TOWER SERIES ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY LITTLE WITH A LOT OF HIS OTHER WORKS
ALSO A PRETTY GOOD SMATTERING OF BOOK SERIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY GEARED TOWARDS YOUNGER READERS WRINKLE IN TIME THE LION THE WITCH THE WARDROBE HARRY POTTER K BOWLING IS JUST SO GOOD WITH THE CADENCE IN HER WRITING THE DARK IS RISING GUIDE TO THE GALAXY ARTEMIS FOWL DISCWORLD ETC

BUT MY FAVORITE WOULD HAVE TO BE THE JOHN COREY SERIES FROM NELSON DEMILLE I JUST LOVE HOW MUCH OF A SMART ARSE HE IS THROUGHOUT
WHAT A SERIFIC STORY NEVER HEARD OF THAT MAN OR HIS BOOKS YOU KNOW NOW I WILL GO TO THE LIBRARY AND DEMAND THAT THIS BOOK BE REQUISITIONED FOR IMMEDIATE READING AND OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES THAT RELATE TO BOOKS THANK YOU FOR THIS STORY
THE COOL GIRL QUOTE IS INCREDIBLY INCISIVE THAT'S WHY IT GOT SHARED SO MUCH EVEN THOUGH IT IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A SOCIOPATH IT RESONATED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE

I THINK SOME PEOPLE GET HUNG UP ON THE VIDEO GAMES AND BEER BUT THE REAL CORE OF THE QUOTE IS THIS
COOL GIRLS NEVER GET ANGRY THEY ONLY SMILE IN A CHAGRINED LOVING MANNER AND LET THEIR MEN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT GO AHEAD SHIT ON ME I DON'T MIND I'M THE COOL GIRL

I DON'T THINK MANY WOMEN ACTUALLY TRY TO BE THE COOL GIRL THOUGH I'VE SEEN IT A FEW TIMES BUT I THINK A LOT OF GUYS HAVE A FANTASY OF A GIRL WHO LIKES EVERYTHING THEY LIKE AND NEVER EVER GETS ANNOYED

BEFORE ANYONE RESPONDS HEY WHAT'S WRONG WITH HAVING A FANTASY OF A GIRL WHO LIKES EVERYTHING THEY LIKE AND NEVER EVER GETS ANNOYED THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS UNREALISTIC TO THINK THAT SOMEONE CLOSE TO YOU WILL LIKE EVERYTHING YOU LIKE AND NEVER GET ANNOYED AT YOU SOONER OR LATER EVERYONE DOES SOMETHING THOUGHTLESS OR SELFISH YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO GET CALLED OUT ON THOSE THINGS AND WHILE IT IS FINE TO DREAM OF DATING SOMEONE WHO LIKES THE RED SOBS AND VIDEO GAMES AS MUCH AS YOU DO THAT IS A VERY LIMITED DATING POOL IT IS AN EVEN MORE LIMITED POOL WHEN YOUR HOBBIES ARE LESS POPULAR LIKE D D OR MME NEVER MIND THE REAL OBSCURE STUFF AND WOMEN DON'T HAVE THE SAME EXPECTATION THAT A GUY WILL SHARE ALL OF THEIR HOBBIES I'VE NEVER MET A GIRL WHO EXPECTED EVERY GUY SHE DATED TO TAKE UP KNITTING BUT I'VE MET GUYS WHO THOUGHT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONVERT THEIR GIRLFRIEND TO ALL THEIR OBSESSIVE HOBBIES

IT IS A DARK QUOTE BUT IT TOUCHES ON SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN EXPRESSED A LOT

I REALLY LOVED THE BOOK NOW PEOPLE CALL IT OVERHOPED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE TEND TO DO WHEN SOMETHING BECOMES POPULAR BUT I THINK IT WAS HYPED FOR GOOD REASON

IT WASN'T THE FIRST BOOK TO FEATURE A DANGEROUS DARK WOMAN BUT IT WAS THE FIRST TO DO IT SO OPENLY AND UNABASHEDLY IN MODERN TIMES AND I LOVE THAT HAVE YOU READ GILLIAN QUOTE FOR WHY SHE WRITES SUCH DARK FEMALE CHARACTERS IT'S MORE OF A BUT IT'S WONDERFUL AND I HEARTILY AGREE WITH HERALDRY MOST OF US WOMEN AREN'T AS DARK AS HER CHARACTERS OF COURSE BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT THE SYMPATHETIC FLAWED ROSES THAT MANY AUTHORS MAKE US OUT TO BE I LOVED THAT THE STORY EXPLORED THE RAGE OF WOMEN EXPRESSED THROUGH ONE WOMAN AND HER THOUGHTS I SAID THIS RECENTLY IN ANOTHER THREAD BUT I THINK MANY WOMEN CAN RELATE A LOT TO AMY THE FURY AND DESPAIR OVER FEELING LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO BE PERFECT THAT IF THEY DON'T KOW-TOW TO A GUY THEY'RE SUDDENLY A SHREW OR HARPY OR BITCH AND THE UGLY REALIZATION THAT SOCIETY AND MEN OFTEN SEE THEM AS OBJECTS TO BE TRADED FOR A YOUNGER PRETTIER MODEL

YES AMY WAS A SOCIOPATH AND NO MOST WOMEN ARE NOT SOCIOPATHS BUT THOUGHTS ON GENDER AND MALE VS FEMALE DYNAMICS HAD A LOT OF TRUTH AND MERIT TO THEM I BELIEVE THE COOL GIRL STEREOTYPE IS TRUE WOMEN ARE OFTEN PRESSURED TO ACT DUMB LIKE SPORTS DRINK BEER AND OTHER SUCH THINGS SO THEY CAN SEEM LIKE THEY CAN HANG AND THEY'RE ONE OF THE DUDES A REALLY COOL CHICK OH BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE HOT BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE AS MUCH PRESSURE ON MEN TO BE HOT AS WELL AS WATCHING GOING TO SPAS WITH WOMEN AND ENJOYING SHOPPING I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S NO PRESSURE ON MEN AT ALL BUT WAY LESS OF IT AFTER ALL A GIRL WHO DRINKS BEER TO PLEASE HER MAN IS A COOL CHICK BUT A GUY WHO WATCHES FASHION WEEK SHOWS TO PLEASE HIS GIRL WOULD BE CALLED WHIPPED OR A PUSSY COME ON DUDE YOU'RE WATCHING FASHION SHOWS JUST SO SHE CAN LIKE YOU WHERE ARE YOUR BALLS MAN

I THINK YOU GUYS GET MY POINT

BOTH AMY AND NICK WERE AWFUL PEOPLE I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS NASTINESS BLOOMED IN MUCH DARKER DANGEROUS WAYS BECAUSE GIRLS AREN'T ALLOWED TO EXPRESS RAGE AS OPENLY SHE FEL STIFLED UNWANTED AND MADE TO FEEL LIKE A TOY DOLL HER WHOLE LIFE AND THIS MESSED HER UP BUT AS LONG AS HER HUSBAND PRETENDED TO BE PERFECT ALONG WITH HER SHE'D ACT NORMAL WHEN NICK DECIDED TO RUIN THE PERFECT PERSONA BY BEING WELL LAZY AND A CHEATER AND A FLAWED HUMAN WELL I THINK RAGE WAS JUSTIFIABLE IT'S NOT FAIR IS IT THAT SHE WAS EXPECTED TO PRETEND TO BE PERFECT HER WHOLE LIFE BUT HER HUSBAND COULD GET AWAY WITH RUINING HIS ACT

THE MURDER OBVIOUSLY IS NOT JUSTIFIABLE NOR ARE THE ACTUAL CRIMES SHE COMMITTEE IT'S JUST HER ANGER I GET

NICK WAS TERRIBLE I FEEL LIKE HE PALES IN COMPARISON TO VIOLENCE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIM HE WAS A TERRIBLE GUY A CHEATER UNWILLING TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIS WIFE PETULANT A PENCHANT TO BLAME EVERYONE ELSE FOR HIS ISSUES MISOGYNISTIC IN HIS THOUGHTS HE WAS A PIECE OF SHIT

AND ULTIMATELY I DON'T THINK GILLIAN FLYNN SET OUT WITH THE GOAL OF CREATING A FEMINIST NOVEL BUT I THINK IN WRITING A FEMALE CHARACTER THAT SO FEW AUTHORS DARE TO AND REALLY TAPPING INTO HER WORLD AND MAKING CERTAIN OBSERVATIONS ABOUT GENDER AND SEX AND VIOLENCE SHE KIND OF INADVERTENTLY CREATED A FEMINIST BOOK I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT

AND I LOVED THE ENDING IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING BUT I LOVE THAT THE AUTHOR WENT THERE CAUSE IN REAL LIFE SOMETIMES OUR ENDINGS ARE UNHAPPY AND UGLY

SORRY FOR THE ESSAY I JUST HAVE A LOT OF THOUGHTS ABOUT GONE GIRL LOL
I WANTED TO THROW THIS BOOK AND THE MOVIE AT THE FUCKING WALL WHEN I WAS FINISHED WITH IT LOL

BUT OVER ALL I THINK THE BOOK WAS REALLY WELL WRITTEN AMY IS CRAZY AND NICK IS JUST AN IDIOT IMO BUT OUT OF THE BOTH OF THEM I FEEL NO SYMPATHY FOR EITHER THEY WERE BOTH WRONG I ATE UP THEIR TOXICITY THROUGHOUT THE BOOK BECAUSE I WAS REALLY FEELING CHARACTER TOWARDS THE SECOND PART RATHER THAN THE FIRST WHERE SHE SEEMED TO ACT MORE LIKE A PANSY I'M NOT A FAN OF THE COOL GIRL STEREOTYPE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN CALL IT THAT AMY DESCRIBES BUT AT THE SAME TIME I ACTUALLY SEE GIRLS LIKE THAT WHO TRY REALLY HARD TO BE THAT AND SOME WHO ARE THAT

I AM NOT COOL GIRL AND PROBABLY WILL NEVER BE COOL GIRL THOUGH AS MUCH AS I ENJOY PLEASING MY MAN AND FINDING OUT WE LIKE THE SAME THINGS I'M ME I'LL ALWAYS BE ME AND THAT'S HOW I AM COOL GIRL ONLY EXISTS IF THE GIRL HERSELF IS CHANGING TO BE HERALDRY
I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE WAY THE COOL GIRL QUOTE HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT

TO ME IT WAS JUST AMY SPOUTING OFF SOMETHING TO JUSTIFY HER MANIPULATIVE ACTIONS IN HER MIND SOCIETY WAS MANIPULATING HER TO BE SOMETHING SHE WAS NOT SO SHE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO DO THE SAME TO THEM AND THAT WENT FOR EVERYONE NOT JUST MEN BECAUSE WE SAW IN THE BOOK EVERYONE WAS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TARGET SHE USED MEN AND WOMEN FOR WHAT SHE WANTED AND RAN THEM UNDER A BUS WHEN SHE WAS DONE WITH THEM SHE USED BOYS AND GIRLS BACK IN GRADE SCHOOL EVEN BEFORE SHE WAS OF AGE TO BE FORCED INTO THE COOL GIRL ROLE THAT'S THE THING SHE HAD BEEN DOING THIS HER ENTIRE LIFE SHE WAS A BAD SEED

AMY IS A MASTER MANIPULATOR EVEN CONVINCING THE READER THAT SHE IS THE VICTIM IN ALL OF THIS AND BECAUSE SHE IS THE VICTIM BECAUSE SHE WAS FORCED INTO THIS COOL GIRL ROLE ACCORDING TO HER SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS EVEN IF IT IS MURDER
NOT REALLY HERE TO DEBATE THE BOOK ITSELF BUT JUST TO TALK ABOUT LIFE

I AM A COOL GIRL FOR A LIVING AND IT'S ONE OF THE MORE MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTING THINGS A PERSON CAN DO TO THEMSELVES IT TAKES A LOT OF MENTAL MAINTENANCE TO KEEP UP PART OF MY JOB DEFINITELY INVOLVES THE REAL ME BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE REAL ME WHO HAS BEEN INVITED TO A HIGH-BROW HOLIDAY PARTY OR WHO IS IN ROUND THREE OF A JOB INTERVIEW YOU'RE ALWAYS ON NEVER OFF OR RELAXED AND BECAUSE YOUR PARTNER HAS THIS FANTASY VERSION OF YOU ONCE THE REAL YOU CREEPS OUT THE FLAWED BEING THAT ALL OF US ARE YOU'RE IN THE DANGER ZONE FOR REVEALING YOURSELF AS A REAL HUMAN AND BEING REPLACED BY SOMEONE MORE COMPLIANT TO FILL THE FANTASY

THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN REAL RELATIONSHIPS WHEN PEOPLE SETTLE IN AND THE INFATUATION PERIOD RUBS OFF RIGHT DATING SOMEONE NEW ALWAYS BRINGS OUT YOUR BEST SIDE AT LEAST FOR AWHILE THEN REALITY SETS IN AND THE RELATIONSHIP BECOMES DEPENDENT ON NEGOTIATING DIFFERENCES AND RIDING THE WAVES AS THEY COME

LET ME KNOW IF I NEED TO EXPAND MY THOUGHTS OR TAKE THEM IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION TO CLARIFY THANKS
GONE GIRL IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BOOKS BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY ONE IN WHICH I ACTUALLY HATE BOTH MAIN CHARACTERS BY THE END
I LIKED THIS BOOK AS IT WAS VERY WELL-WRITTEN I WAS ENGROSSED WITH HOW AMY TALKS AND MIND YOU AND I WATCHED THE MOVIE RIGHT AFTER I READ IT I LOVED HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL THEY ARE EVEN DECIDED TO STAY WITH EACH OTHER ON THE END LOL
THE STORY FOR WHAT IT WAS DID AN AMAZING JOB AT CREATING A FEMALE VILLAIN THAT MADE THE READER UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE YOU FELT LIKE YOU WANTED TO SUPPORT HER BUT KNEW SHE WAS A COMPLETE PSYCHO HAVING THE WHOLE THING TOLD FROM HER POINT OF VIEW WHERE SHE CAN ONLY SEE EVERYTHING SHE DOES AS JUSTIFIED AND RIGHT FORCED YOU TO FEEL THAT WAY IT ALSO PROBABLY CONTRIBUTES TO WHY ALMOST EVERY MALE CHARACTER AND MOST OF THE FEMALE CHARACTERS BESIDES HER COME OFF AS EITHER STUPID SELFISH DISHONEST AND A BUNCH OF OTHER NEGATIVE CHARACTER FLAWS SHE HAS SUCH DISDAIN FOR THEM THAT SHE CAN'T HELP BUT PORTRAY THEM AS BAD PEOPLE IT JUST FURTHER FORCES THE AUDIENCE TO SIDE WITH HERALDRY

THERE'S ALSO THE WHOLE COOL GIRL SEROTYPE DOES IT EVEN EXIST OR IS IT THE IMAGINATION OF A IGNORANT MALE

I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD BE IGNORANT FEMALE INSTEAD OF MALE THE WHOLE SPEECH SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS SAID BY SOMEONE WHO'S ONLY EXPERIENCE WITH MEN WAS THROUGH THE PAGES OF COSMO IT'S A BIG STRAWMAN ARGUMENT SETUP SO SHE CAN SAY I'M SINGLE I'M UNHAPPY I'M FORCED TO ACT LIKE THE COOL GIRL BECAUSE MEN ARE ONLY ATTRACTED TO THE COOL GIRL WHEN MOST GUYS OUT THERE THAT ARE NOTHING LIKE THAT IT'S LIKE THE GENDERSWAPPED VERSION OF I'M SINGLE I'M UNHAPPY I'M FORCED TO BE AN ASSHOLE BECAUSE WOMEN ARE ONLY ATTRACTED TO ASSHOLES
HAVE YOU READ THE ESSAY FROM WEBSITE ABOUT HER FEMALE CHARACTERS IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY INTERESTING
ALTHOUGH HER DESCRIPTION OF THE COOL GIRL IS PROBABLY PRETTY ACCURATE I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY COMMON TO FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP BEING SOMEONE THEY ARE NOT I KNOW LOTS OF COUPLES THAT STARTED OUT AS ONE PERSON CHANGING A LITTLE TO FIT INTO THE OTHER PERSONS MOLD IT'S NOT SOMETHING I COULD EVER DO BUT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE STILL GOING STRONG AFTER MANY MANY YEARS

WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN READING THIS PASSAGE THAT THE CHARACTER AMY HAD NO PERSONALITY OF HER OWN SHE JUST EMULATED PERSONALITIES THAT SHE WANTED
I HAVE A BUNCH OF GUY FRIENDS I'M A GUY I ALWAYS WENT AFTER THE SWEET GIRL NEVER THE COOL GIRL MY ONE FRIEND WHO DATED THE MEAN GIRL THE BITCH IS STILL HAPPILY MARRIED AND THEY HAVE TWO WONDERFUL CHILDREN TOGETHER SOME OF MY OTHER FRIENDS PURSUED THE CONCEPT OF THE COOL GIRL

THOSE THAT SEEK THE COOL GIRL MAY FIND THAT PERSON ONE IN A THOUSAND PEOPLE MIGHT FIT THAT DESCRIPTION BUT IF YOU ARE SEEKING THOSE QUALITIES WHAT QUALITIES ARE BEING IGNORED

IS THE COOL GIRL NICE TO STRANGERS

DOES SHE LIKE CATS AND PUPPIES

OR IS SHE A COMPLETE PSYCHOPATH

I'VE FOUND THE LATTER TO BE MORE PREVALENT
I LIKED THE BOOK I DON'T THINK THE NARRATIVE YOU'VE REFERENCED ABOVE IS A CENTRAL PLOT LINE BUT I SEE ITS RELEVANCY IT DEFINITELY HAD SOME FEMINIST THEMES I GUESS THAT COULD BE A GOOD OR BAD THING DEPENDING ON THE READER
I LOVED THE BOOK BUT HATED THE OTHER TWO GILLIAN WROTE

I THINK THE PREMISE IS NICE WE SO RARELY SEE A WOMAN IN MEDIA WHO IS EVIL ON HER OWN RIGHT WITHOUT A MAN BEHIND HER SCORN SHE WAS A WHACKO LONG BEFORE HER MARRIAGE AND HER HUBBY CHEATING WAS JUST A REASON TO CANALIZE THAT WACKINESS PLUS IT WAS CLEVERLY WRITTEN

I ALSO ENJOYED THE ENDING AS IT'S A MIRROR OF LIFE LOTS OF TIMES COUPLES STAY TOGETHER COZ THEY ARE SCARED TO REMAIN ALONE YOU CROSS THIS TYPE EVERYDAY AT WORK AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND CAN'T HELP BUT ROLL YOUR EYES AT THEM AS IF BEING A COUPLE BRINGS IN A SOCIAL STATUS THEY CAN'T ACHIEVE ON THEIR OWN

AS FOR THE COOL GIRL I ENJOYED IT IMMENSELY IF ONLY FOR ALL THE OUTRAGE FROM WOMEN WHO WERE READY TO DEFEND SO HARD THEIR IN THE MATTER ONLY TO REINFORCE THE PREMISE BEHIND IT LOL IT WAS SPOT ON AND FUNNY TO SEE

THE MOVIE WAS DONE REALLY WELL AND I DID NOT EXPECT LESS FROM FINCHER WHO EXCELLED AT GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO I THINK HE SHOULD DO INVISIBLE MONSTERS FROM PLAHNIUK NEXT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SO AND
THE COOL GIRL OBSERVATION IS ESSENTIALLY A SEQUEL OR AN UPDATE TO THE STRETFORD WIVES IMAGE FANTASY

I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY PERTINENT IN A WORLD WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE LARGE CHUNKS OF MEN NEVER GROW UP AND INSTEAD IN THEIR ADULT LIVES BEHAVE JUST LIKE SPOILT LITTLE BOYS WITH SEX AND A GIRLFRIEND AS THE NEW TOY THAT THEY WANT TO PLAY WITH THERE'S A DISTURBING TENDENCY AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE IT COMES FROM OF PEOPLE AND I WOULD SAY ESPECIALLY MEN BECAUSE THAT'S WHO I SEE IT IN MOST DESIRING THE CONCEPT OF A GIRLFRIEND A WOMAN WHO WILL BE THERE TO BE SEEN AND TO HAVE SEX WITH THEM RATHER THAN DESIRING TO BEFRIEND A WOMAN FALL IN LOVE AND BECOME PARTNERS IT'S VERY DETACHED AND ALMOST ROBOTIC

WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THIS ISN'T LIMITED TO STRAIGHT MEN GAY MEN DO THIS TOO FANTASIZE ABOUT THIS AND EXPECT THIS I THINK IT MUST BE AN IMAGE OR FANTASY THAT COMES ACROSS IN MEDIA TO TAKE HOLD AT A YOUNG AGE I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF IT'S RELATED TO THE FACT THAT LOVE IS MARKETED AS A THING FOR WOMEN TO BE CONCERNED WITH OR TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH THAN MEN THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE FOR MEDIA AIMED AT CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS TOO
I THINK THE COOL GIRL STEREOTYPE IS TRUE AND I'D NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE BUT IT EXPLAINED WHY I'D GET BORED WITH RELATIONSHIPS ONCE THE GIRL CHANGED AND GOT BORING NAGGY DEMANDING IF I HADN'T ALREADY GOTTEN OVER THAT ATTITUDE AND ENTERED A LTR THAT PASSAGE MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN THE CATALYST FOR CHANGING IT

AS FOR THE BOOK I ENJOYED IT EXCITING AND ENTERTAINING FOR WHAT IT WAS THOUGH IT LOSES SOME POINTS FOR THE DUMB ENDING I'D SAY HE WAS A SHITTY GUY AND SHE WAS A MUCH SHITTIER WOMAN NOT A FAN OF THEY DESERVE EACH OTHER
DELETED
ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE THE BOOK THAT MUCH THE QUOTE IS ACTUALLY GENIUS AMY CLAIMS HERE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO HANDLE CONFRONTATION IS TO EITHER GET EMOTIONAL OR TO BE ABSOLUTELY PASSIVE BOTH ARE NOT REALLY A MENTALLY HEALTHY WAY TO DEAL WITH THINGS WHICH SURPRISE TOTALLY FITS HER PROFILE
SO MAYBE THE FACT THAT SHE IS A SOCIOPATH REALLY CANNOT BE DISMISSED WHEN IT COMES TO THIS QUOTE
WHY DO PEOPLE LIE IT ISN'T ONLY BECAUSE THEY STRUGGLE AGAINST EACH OTHER IT'S ALSO BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE SEEKING
IT'S A DECENT BOOK WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF SUSPENSE BUT NOTHING TO REALLY WRITE HOME ABOUT
FEMINIST EMPOWERMENT OR MRA NIGHTMARE SCENARIO

I HAVE SEEN THIS THROWN AROUND AND UNDERSTAND WHY BUT I THOUGHT THAT BEYOND THE GENDERS THERE ARE TWO REALLY BAD PERSONS BEING REALLY BAD ONE TURNS OUT TO BE A MORE SPECTACULAR BAD PERSON I THINK THERE IS A BIT OF RESENTMENT IN THIS DISCUSSION THOUGH AMY IS AN SPECTACULAR CHARACTER THAT IN HER EVILNESS DOES SOMETHING REALLY SPECTACULAR WHILE NICK GET SHAFTED IN HIS BAD BEHAVIOURS AND ATTITUDES BY AMY

BOTH GET HOWEVER AWAY WITH EVERYTHING THUS THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE WHOLE DISCUSSION ON THE EXCELLENT BOOK SEEMS A BIT POINTLESS TO ME MAYBE I'M WRONG AND THE AUTHOR WANTS THIS TO HAPPEN BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE SUCH A BIG PART OF THE DISCUSSION THAT SEEMS TO OVERSHADOW HOW THIS DOESN'T REALLY SEEM FEMALE EMPOWERMENT OR MRA NIGHTMARE BUT TWO ARGUABLE PSYCHOS ACTING LIKE IT

EDIT FUN FACT WHILE I WAS WATCHING THE MOVIE MY GIRLFRIEND ASKED ME HOW WAS IT ALL I COULD TELL HER WAS THAT I HATED EVERYONE IN IT EXCEPT MARGOT GO FIGURE

ALL OF US FAILED TO MATCH OUR DREAM OF PERFECTION SO I RATE US ON THE BASIS OF OUR SPLENDID FAILURE TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE IN MY OPINION IF I COULD WRITE ALL MY WORK AGAIN I AM CONVINCED THAT I WOULD DO IT BETTER WHICH IS THE HEALTHIEST CONDITION FOR AN ARTIST THAT S WHY HE KEEPS ON WORKING TRYING AGAIN HE BELIEVES EACH TIME THAT THIS TIME HE WILL DO IT BRING IT OFFICIAL OF COURSE HE WON T WHICH IS WHY THIS CONDITION IS HEALTHY ONCE HE DID IT ONCE HE MATCHED THE WORK TO THE IMAGE THE DREAM NOTHING WOULD REMAIN BUT TO CUT HIS THROAT JUMP OFF THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT PINNACLE OF PERFECTION INTO SUICIDE I M A FAILED POETIC MAYBE EVERY NOVELIST WANTS TO WRITE POETRY FIRST FINDS HE CAN T AND THEN TRIES THE SHORT STORY WHICH IS THE MOST DEMANDING FORM AFTER POETRY AND FAILING AT THAT ONLY THEN DOES HE TAKE UP NOVEL WRITING

HELL YES
I CAN'T TELL IF THIS IS HUMILITY OR HUBRIS

HUMILITY WE AREN'T IMPORTANT AS INDIVIDUALS

HUBRIS THE THINGS WE WROTE ARE SO CULTURALLY SIGNIFICANT AND SO NECESSARY TO HUMANITY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE EVENTUALLY BEEN PRODUCED BY SOMEONE ELSE
WHILE HE GIVES AN EXAMPLE OF WORKS IN AN ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY THAT COMMENT I HAVE TO DISAGREE

THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SEVERAL FAULKNER STRUGGLING TO WRITE AND BE SUCCESSFUL BUT ONLY ONE WAS ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND BE HEARD AND WHEN IT IS HEARD WE HEAR THAT INDIVIDUAL'S VOICE
IT RAN IN HIS KNOWLEDGE BEFORE HE EVER SAW IT IT LOOKED AND TOWERED IN HIS DREAMS BEFORE HE EVEN SAW THE UNAXED WOODS WHERE IT LEFT ITS CROOKED PRINT SHAGGY HUGE RED-EYED NOT MALEVOLENT BUT JUST BIG TOO BIG FOR THE DOGS WHICH TRIED TO BAY IT FOR THE HORSES WHICH TRIED TO RIDE IT DOWN FOR THE MEN AND THE BULLETS THEY FIRED INTO IT TOO BIG FOR THE VERY COUNTRY WHICH WAS ITS CONSTRICTING SCOPE HE SEEMED TO SEE IT ENTIRE WITH A CHILD S COMPLETE DIVINATION BEFORE HE EVER LAID EYES ON EITHER THE DOOMED WILDERNESS WHOSE EDGES WERE BEING CONSTANTLY AND PUNILY GNAWED AT BY MEN WITH AXES AND PLOWS WHO FEARED IT BECAUSE IT WAS WILDERNESS MEN MYRIAD AND NAMELESS EVEN TO ONE ANOTHER IN THE LAND WHERE THE OLD BEAR HAD EARNED A NAME THROUGH WHICH RAN NOT EVEN A MORTAL ANIMAL BUT AN ANACHRONISM INDOMITABLE AND INVINCIBLE OUT OF AN OLD DEAD TIME A PHANTOM EPITOME AND APOTHEOSIS OF THE OLD WILD LIFE AT WHICH THE PUNY HUMANS SWARMED AND HACKED IN A FURY OF ABHORRENCE AND FEAR LIKE PYGMIES ABOUT THE ANKLES OF A DROWSING ELEPHANT THE OLD BEAR SOLITARY INDOMITABLE AND ALONE WIDOWERED CHILDLESS AND ABSOLVED OF MORTALITY OLD PRIAM REFT OF HIS OLD WIFE AND HAVING OUTLIVED ALL HIS SONS

JACK WHITE SAID THE SAME THING

IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE DEATH OF AMY WINEHOUSE LANA DEL REY WOULD NEVER BE FAMOUS

IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE BREAKUP OF THE WHITE STRIPES THE BLACK KEYS WOULD NEVER GET POPULAR
GREAT ARTICLE THE LINE BELOW STOOD OUT IT IS AMAZING HOW GENDER PERCEPTIONS HAVE CHANGED FAULKNER WAS A WISE MAN TALKING YET WE SEE SOCIETY'S TINT OF HIS TRUTH EVEN IF IT IS IN JEST

SUCCESS IS FEMININE AND LIKE A WOMAN IF YOU CRINGE BEFORE HER SHE WILL OVERRIDE YOU SO THE WAY TO TREAT HER IS TO SHOW HER THE BACK OF YOUR HAND THEN MAYBE SHE WILL DO THE CRAWLING
I WOULD SAY THAT MUSIC IS THE EASIEST MEANS IN WHICH TO EXPRESS SINCE IT CAME FIRST IN MAN S EXPERIENCE AND HISTORY BUT SINCE WORDS ARE MY TALENT I MUST TRY TO EXPRESS CLUMSILY IN WORDS WHAT THE PURE MUSIC WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER THAT IS MUSIC WOULD EXPRESS BETTER AND SIMPLER BUT I PREFER TO USE WORDS AS I PREFER TO READ RATHER THAN LISTEN I PREFER SILENCE TO SOUND AND THE IMAGE PRODUCED BY WORDS OCCURS IN SILENCE THAT IS THE THUNDER AND THE MUSIC OF THE PROSE TAKE PLACE IN SILENCE

THIS PART GOT TO ME

EDIT

MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS ARE SARAH GAMP A CRUEL RUTHLESS WOMAN A DRUNKARD OPPORTUNIST UNRELIABLE MOST OF HER CHARACTER WAS BAD BUT AT LEAST IT WAS CHARACTER

AND THIS ONE
I WAS BORN AND LIVED IN THE SOUTH UNTIL MY TWENTIES I'VE ALWAYS LOVED READING BUT HONESTLY NEVER LIKED FAULKNER AND NEVER EVEN MADE IT THROUGH ONE OF HIS BOOKS
I DISAGREE OTHER WORKS WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE GREATS OF THAT TIME BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE SAME CONTENT OR IDEAS WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT ON
I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS TRUE IF KENDRICK LAMAR DIDN'T EXIST I REALLY CAN'T IMAGINE SOMEBODY ELSE COMING ALONG AND REPLICATING HIM I HAVE A TON OF RESPECT FOR FAULKNER THOUGH

HE LOOKS JUST LIKE ROBERT DE NIRO

WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE

FAULKNER

YES I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE OF GEORGE ORWELL S I HAVE AN IDEA FOR AN ENDING WHICH WOULD PROVE THE THESIS I M ALWAYS HAMMERING AT THAT MAN IS INDESTRUCTIBLE BECAUSE OF HIS SIMPLE WILL TO FREEDOM

DAMN BEEN INTERESTING TO SEE IF THERE IS A SCRIPT OF SUCH ENDING
I DON'T THINK I REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS QUOTE COMPLETELY WHAT MAKES AUTHORS SO GREAT LIKE HEMINGWAY AND FAULKNER IS THAT THEIR STYLE IS SO UNLIKE ANYONE RIGHT IF HEMINGWAY NEVER EXISTED THEN WE WOULD NEVER HAVE EXPERIENCED HIS PARTICULAR STYLE I GET THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN OTHER AUTHORS WHO HAD THE SAME TYPE OF LIFE AS HIM THEREFORE THE CONTENT WOULD BE SIMILAR AUTHORS WHO WERE WRITING IN THE SAME VEIN BUT ON THE SENTENCE BY SENTENCE LEVEL HEMINGWAY STANDS ALONE THAT'S WHY HE IS HEMINGWAY
HE SURE KNOWS HOW TO TALK NONSENSE
I HAVE A WEIRD LOVE HATE THING WITH FAULKNER HE HAS WRITTEN SOME AMAZING LINES IN HIS BOOKS BUT DAMN IS IT A SLOW BUILDING I ALSO HAVE ISSUE WITH THE IDEA THAT THE HUMAN CONDITION CAN ONLY BE EXAMINED THROUGH THE LENS OF POOR WHITE TRASH IN THE SOUTHERN THAT LAST POINT MAY HAVE MORE TO DO WITH MY PERSONAL BIASES AGAINST WHITE TRASH SOUTHERNERS THAN IT HAS TO DO WITH FAULKNER
ONE DAY I WAS TALKING TO CORA SHE PRAYED FOR ME BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED I WAS BLIND TO SIN WANTING ME TO KNEEL AND PRAY TOO BECAUSE PEOPLE TO WHOM SIN IS JUST A MATTER OF WORDS TO THEM SALVATION IS JUST WORDS TOO IS SUCH AN INSIGHTFUL LINE THAT I CAN FORGIVE HIM A LOT BUT I STILL CAN'T FULLY EMBRACE HIM

RE MEMOIRS THE FULL QUOTE IS MEMOIRS ARE BULLSHIT TO SOME DEGREE

SOME PEOPLE HAVE CLAIMED THAT MEMOIRS ARE MORE APPROPRIATE TO THE TIME WE LIVE IN BUT ALSO SUPERIOR TO FICTION LISTENING TO THAT KIND OF TALK AND SEEING SITUATIONS LIKE THE JAMES FREY INCIDENT THE THING THAT MADE EVERYONE UPSET WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD LIED YOU KNOW THAT HE PASSED THIS THING OFF AS TRUE WHEN IT WAS A WORK OF FICTION WAS WRONG WHAT PISSED ME OFF AS A NOVELIST WAS THAT HE WROTE IT AS A NOVEL AND NOBODY WANTED TO PUBLISH IT THEN HE RELABELED IT AS A MEMOIR AND SUDDENLY EVERYBODY WANTS TO PUBLISH IT AND EVERYONE WANTS TO READ IT

THAT OFFENDS ME BECAUSE I M A NOVELIST AND WRITING NOVELS IS WHAT I DO I TAKE THAT PERSONALLY ON SOME LEVELS IT ALSO OFFENDS ME BECAUSE IT S BULLSHIT MEMOIRS ARE BULLSHIT TO SOME DEGREE I DON T MEAN MEMOIRIST ARE LIARS SOME MIGHT BE MOST ARE NOT I KNOW MEMOIRIST TRY TO BE SCRUPULOUS AND TRY NOT TO DEVIATE FROM WHAT THEY REMEMBER IT S THE LAST FEW WORDS OF MY SENTENCE WHERE THE BULLSHIT COMES IN OF COURSE WHAT YOU REMEMBER IS A LIE OR A DISTORTION IT S INACCURATE THERE S CONFLATION THERE S ELISION THERE ARE GAPS THERE MAYBE THINGS THAT YOU VE DELIBERATELY FORGOTTEN AND THEN FORGOTTEN THAT YOU VE FORGOTTEN SO THAT YOU SINCERELY THINK THEY DIDN T HAPPEN

SOME OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY HAVE BEEN MEMOIRS LIKE FRANK CONROY S OR TOBIAS WOLFE S THIS BOY S LIFE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRITTEN BEAUTIFUL WORKS OF LITERATURE THAT ARE MEMOIRS I M NOT TRYING TO IMPUGN INDIVIDUAL WRITERS AT ALL I M NOT EVEN NECESSARILY IMPUGNING THE FORM OF THE GENRE IT S JUST THE CLAIMS THAT ARE MADE THE ESTEEM THAT IS GIVEN THE MEMOIR SEEMS TO HAVE A HIGHER VALUE BECAUSE IT CLAIMS TO BE THE TRUTH OBVIOUSLY IT JUST SIMPLY CAN T BE ON SOME LEVEL THE TRUTH

AS A NOVELIST I MUCH PREFER AND AM MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH A SELF-DECLARED LIE THAT IS INVITED BY THE PERSON BEING LIED TO

THIS IS ALSO SOME OF THE TROUBLE WITH REALITY TELEVISION IT IS PACKAGED AS REAL EVEN THOUGH THE SITUATIONS ARE CONTRIVED AND THE FOOTAGE IS HEAVILY EDITED THIS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE DEFINITELY IS A HUNGER BOTH ON TELEVISION AND IN BOOKS FOR A REAL STORY BUT AS HE SAYS THERE ARE GAPS THERE MAYBE THINGS THAT YOU VE DELIBERATELY FORGOTTEN AND THEN FORGOTTEN THAT YOU VE FORGOTTEN SO THAT YOU SINCERELY THINK THEY DIDN T HAPPEN AND IN ADDITION TO THIS THERE ARE THE MOVING PARTS OF THE STORY YOU DON'T KNOW ALL YOU HAVE IS ONE POINT OF VIEW

I LATER READ IT MYSELF LIKE IN ENGLIS IN COLLEGE REALLY LIKED IT IT WAS FUN TO STUDY BUT THE WHOLE TIME I THOUGHT MAN IF I HAD TO READ THIS WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN IT WOULD BE LIKE GETTING BEATEN OVER THE HEAD WITH A HAMMER
THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA THAT PARTICULAR BOOK WAS TORTURE FOR ME TO FINISH

OTHERWISE I LOVED ALL OF THE BOOKS I WAS FORCED TO READ IN SCHOOL
I WAS FORCED TO READ BOTH GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND WUTHERING HEIGHTS AT SCHOOL AND THEN AGAIN AT UNIVERSITY THEY WERE TWO OF THE DULLEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ AND BEING FORCED TO READ THEM MADE THEM EVEN WORSE FOR ME

FRANKENSTEIN THE SHINING OF MICE AND MEN THE TURN OF THE SCREW AND FIGHT CLUB WERE ALL READ DURING MY HIGH SCHOOL SIXTH FORM UNIVERSITY CLASSES I PERSONALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE ALL GREAT BOOKS TO READ AS A GROUP
THE BIBLE
MY COLLEGE AMERICAN PURITANS AND ROMANTICS LIT CLASS JUST FINISHED READING AND DISCUSSING THE SCARLET LETTER AND WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED READING IN HIGH SCHOOL IF WE AS ENGLISH MAJORS STRUGGLE TO INTERPRET IT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

WHEN I WAS A HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN I WAS FORCED TO READ GREAT EXPECTATIONS WHICH I DON'T THINK WAS A GOOD IDEA IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS WELL INTO BEING AN ENGLISH MAJOR THAT I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE DICKENS HUCKLEBERRY FINN IS ANOTHER THAT SHOULDN'T BE FORCED IN THE CLASSROOM EITHER

I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF CLASSICS THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BUT THEY HAVE TO BE CLASSICS THAT WILL BE ENGAGING FOR KIDS THAT DON'T NORMALLY LIKE TO READ IF YOU'RE GOING TO FORCE KIDS TO READ SOMETHING MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL APPRECIATE FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T DUMP GREAT EXPECTATIONS ON THEM HEHE WHEN THEY ARE YEARS OLD
YOU'RE GOING TO HATE THIS BUT HERE ME OUT STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE TO READ THE GREAT GATSBY IN CLASSES FOR THE MOST PART STUDENTS REBEL STUDENTS REBEL AND USE THE CLIFF NOTES OR SPARKNOTES JUST TO GET IT DONE GATSBY IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE IN AMERICA NEEDS TO READ NOT JUST GET THROUGH AS A MEANS TO AN END WE SHOULD PICK IT UP BECAUSE WE WANT TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING SPECIAL THIS CAN GO FOR MANY OF THE CLASSICS
GRAPES OF WRATH THERE WAS NO JOY IN THAT BOOK AND CONSIDERING HOW LITTLE TIME WAS GIVEN TO IT IN THE CURRICULUM THERE WAS NO TIME FOR DISCUSSION SO WHY FORCE THE KIDS TO READ IT
I THINK HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS SHOULD READ HIGH LIFE BY MATHEW STOKE
I READ MY ANTONIA FOR NINTH GRADE ENGLISH CLASS AND ABSOLUTELY DETESTED IT THE THING IS I ONLY HATED IT WHEN I HAD TO SIT DOWN AND RUSH CHAPTERS WHEN I WAS BEHIND WHEN I ACTUALLY ALLOWED MYSELF TO GET INTO IT I ENJOYED IT

THE BOOK WAS PRETTY LITTLE HOUSE ON THE AND I PERSONALLY NEVER LOVED THOSE BOOKS SO THAT IS DEFINITELY A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR
TESS OF THE MOTHER F AKING DUBERVILLES
SHAKESPEARE ANYTHING OF HIS I FIND HIM OVER RATED MOST PPL TELL ME I HAVE TO READ HIM JUST BECAUSE I HATED IT IN HIGH SCHOOL AND DON'T BOTHER WITH HIM SINCE
I'M GUESSING MOST PEOPLE WHO REPLIED TO THIS QUESTION WENT TO SCHOOL IN THE US YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW EASY YOU HAVE IT BEING FROM A RELATIVELY YOUNG COUNTRY IN MY COUNTRY EEG SOME BRIGHT SOUL HAD THE IDEA OF THE LIT SYLLABUS USED NATIONALLY TO BE IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER FIRST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL LIT CLASSES WAS SPENT ON ENDLESS MEDIEVAL LIVES OF SAINTS OR MARTYRS OR HERMITS OR SELF-STYLED PROPHETS AND BORING CHRONICLES STILL MAKES ME WONDER HOW ANYONE EMERGES FROM THAT NOT BEING PUT OFF BOOKS AND READING FOR LIFE
I FEEL SOMEWHAT ENVIOUS WHEN OTHER PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HAVING READ ALL OF THESE BOOKS IN SCHOOL FOR CLASSES I COUNT ON MY HAND WHAT WE HAD TO READ AS PART OF A CLASS THROUGHOUT MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARS BUT MOST OF THOSE WERE JUST EXCERPTS WE JUST LEARNED HOW TO WRITE PARAGRAPHS AND I WAS IN ONE OF THE GOOD CLASSES


THAT SAID THOUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY KIDS MIGHT NOT ENJOY READING BOOKS AS PART OF A CLASSICAL SOMETIMES THE TEACHERS NOT JUST THE KIDS DON'T KNOW HOW TO DISCUSS THEM OR LACK UNDERSTANDING OF THE TEXT AND YOU HAVE KIDS WITH MIXED READING COMPREHENSION ABILITIES
I FEEL LIKE THE BOOKS I ENJOYED THE MOST IN SCHOOL WOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED CLASSIC LITERATURE I REMEMBER READING GIRL WHO OWNED THE CITY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND LOVED IT ALTHOUGH THERE WERE A FEW BOOKS THAT ARE CLASSICS THAT I DID LIKE I EAST THE OUTSIDERS BUT WHEN YOU HAVE 8TH GRADERS READING ROMEO AND JULIET DON'T BE SURPRISED THAT THEY CAN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND OR APPRECIATE THE PLAY AND THE EXCUSE OF THE CHARACTERS ARE YOUR AGE ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH
WE HAD TO READ TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD IN MY SOPHOMORE ENGLISH CLASS AND I LOVED IT WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE WAS SPENDING THE ENTIRE MONTH ON IT THAT'S CLASSROOM DAYS ROUGHLY HOURS ON THIS BOOK WE READ LIKE TWO CHAPTERS EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS I HAD THE BOOK FINISHED IN THE FIRST NIGHT IT WAS ASSIGNED BECAUSE I ENDED UP LOVING IT SO MUCH BUT MAN THAT REST OF THE MONTH WAS TEDIOUS
I CAN COUNT HOW MANY BOOKS I ACTUALLY ENJOYED READING IN SCHOOL ON ONE HAND I AM A HUGE READING I DEVOUR BOOKS BUT MOST OF THE BOOKS I HAD TO READ IN SCHOOL I ABSOLUTELY HATED I CANNOT STAND CATCHER IN THE RYE OR ANYTHING WRITTEN BY STEINBECK WAITING FOR GODOT AND LONG DAYS JOURNEY INTO NIGHT WERE EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL TO READ THE FEW THAT I DID ENJOY TENDED TO BE ONES THAT I HAD ALREADY READ OR BY AUTHORS I KNEW I LIKED I ENJOYED SHAKESPEARE AND CANTERBURY TALES BUT I THINK THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGE OF THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I USUALLY READ
MANY OF THE BOOKS THAT WE WERE FORCED TO READ NO LONGER PERTAIN TO THE EVERYDAY TEENAGER THEY ARE EXCRUCIATINGLY OLD FASHIONED AND SOMETIMES ARE VERY LONG BOOKS THAT ARE MORE IN LINE WITH TEENAGERS TODAY SHOULD BE READ NOT SURE WHAT THEY WOULD BE BUT I DEFINITELY THINK THAT SOMETHING LIKE HARRY POTTER CAN BE USED TO TEACH A MYRIAD OF IDEAS IN A MORE ENTERTAINING WAY THAN SOME OF THE CURRENT BOOKS IN THE CURRICULUM
IN HIGH SCHOOL WE READ OR SHAKESPEARE BOOKS FUCK THAT SHIT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT STUFF AT THAT AGE I COULD READ THE WORDS BUT NOT THE MEANING OR SUBTLETY I NOW WON'T TOUCH THAT STUFF I HEAR ITS GOOD BUT I REALLY HATE THE MEMORY OF THOSE BOOKS
I HAD TO READ THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD FOR TENTH GRADE ENGLISH I STILL HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA HOW I A WHITE MALE TEENAGER IN ANN ARBOR WAS SUPPOSED TO CONNECT WITH A MIDDLE AGED BLACK WOMAN IN THE SOUTH AND HER VARIOUS MARITAL ESCAPADES
THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN COULD NOT STAND THAT BOOK AND HOW IT FELT LIKE TAKING THE INNER WORKINGS OF AN ADAD CHILDS MIND AND PUTTING THEM INTO A BOOK
I BASICALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULDN'T FORCE KIDS TO READ ANYTHING
WITH MY READING SPEED BOOKS REALLY IS HOW MANY BOOKS I COULD READ IN A YEAR
I'D PICK A MIX OF BIG CHALLENGE BOOKS AND NEW BOOKS FROM OLD FAVOURITE AUTHORS SOMETHING LIKE

HEY
I'VE ONLY EVER READ ONE BOOK TOGETHER WITH SOMEONE ONLINE IT WAS ACTUALLY A REALLY COOL EXPERIENCE WE STILL KEEP IN TOUCH HE TURNED OUT TO BE A SUPER NICE PERSON
THE THING IS I READ MOSTLY FANTASY SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT INTERESTING TO READ WITH ME
THIS ISN'T QUITE THE SAME BUT I CHECK IN WITH R AND OFTEN I'M EITHER READING SOMETHING OTHER PEOPLE HAVE RECENTLY READ OR COMMENTING ON SOMETHING THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE READING THAT I'VE RECENTLY READ

IT'S HARD THOUGH READING A BOOK ISN'T LIKE SEEING A MOVIE TOGETHER PEOPLE READ AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN THAT KIND OF THING THE LAST TIME I ACTUALLY READ A BOOK AT THE SAME TIME AS OTHER PEOPLE WAS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAVE YET TO JOIN AN IN PERSON BOOK CLUB YET THOUGH BECAUSE I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY FOUND A GOOD GROUP THAT SELECTS INTERESTING BOOKS AND ACTUALLY READS THEM I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE LARGER ONLINE GROUPS TOO THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH MORE THAN REACTIONS AND BARELY ANY CONVERSATIONS I'VE KIND OF GIVEN UP ON FINDING GOOD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SPECIFIC BOOKS IN AN ONLINE FORMAT THOUGH SOMETIMES THIS REDDIN HAS SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS
I'M WILLING TO BOOK BUDDY WITH SOMEONE

I'M LIKE YOU A MEMBER OF A BOOK CLUB BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE BOOK A MONTH USED TO BE TWO BUT THAT WAS TOO MUCH PROVIDED I GET A SAY IN WHAT BOOK WE READ AND THE OTHER PERSON ACTUAL READS IT TOO I'M GAME
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT I ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF READING TOGETHER

FIRST OF ALL OF COURSE I HAVE KIDS AND I AM CONSTANTLY READING THEIR BOOKS OUT LOUD TO THEM BUT ALSO IF I AM READING A BOOK I THINK THEY MIGHT LIKE AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE AROUND I WILL READ WHATEVER SECTION I AM UP TO OUT LOUD TO THEM

BUT OTHER THAN THAT MY SPOUSE AND I READ OUT LOUD TO EACH OTHER ON A REGULAR BASIS RIGHT NOW WE ARE READING THE MAGICIANS BY LEV GROSSMAN

WE ALSO READ IN TANDEM A LOT WE HANG OUT TOGETHER LAYING ON THE BED OR SITTING ON THE COUCH READING SEPARATE BOOKS BUT WE HAVE THE TENDENCY TO READ OUT LITTLE SNIPPETS TO EACH OTHER AND DISCUSSION WE HAVE A LARGE HOME LIBRARY AND MOST OF THE TIME ONE OF US HAS ALREADY READ THE BOOK THE OTHER IS CURRENTLY READING

I READ IN TANDEM WITH FRIENDS TOO HAVE SINCE WE WERE TEENAGERS WE USED TO SIMPLY GET TOGETHER TO READ SEPARATE BOOKS IN EACH OTHER S COMPANY FOR HOURS AND HOURS IT FRUSTRATED OUR PARENTS I THINK

I DO HAVE A GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT HAS A COOKBOOK CLUB WE READ THE SAME COOKBOOK THEN GET TOGETHER HAVING COOKED A RECIPE OR TWO FROM IT AND HAVE A POT LUCK

I HAVE ANOTHER GROUP OKAY IT OVERLAPS SOME OF FRIENDS THAT IS BASICALLY A BOOK CLUB WHEN WE GET TOGETHER WE ALL DISCUSS WHAT HE HAVE BEEN READING SINCE WE SAW EACH OTHER LAST AND WHAT WE PLAN ON READING NEXT WE EXCHANGE REVIEWS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND VERY OFTEN WIND UP READING THE SAME BOOK AT THE SAME TIME WHICH WE THEN OF COURSE DISCUSSION IT WINDS UP BEING KIND OF LIKE A TV SHOW ARE YOU UP TO THIS PART YET ETC
YOU MEAN ALL OF YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDSHIPS AREN'T FORMED AROUND BOOKS
I STARTED R READALONG AS A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO BUDDY UP AND READ BOOKS WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAT WANT TO READ THE SAME BOOKS

BUT YEAH THERE ARE A TONNE OF BOOK CLUBS ON LINE JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT BOOKS YOU LIKE TO READ AND IN WHAT FORMAT YOU LIKE YOUR DISCUSSIONS
MY SO AND I READ THE DISCWORLD SERIES TOGETHER HE'D READ THEM BEFORE AND I NEVER HAD
I'D LOVE TO HAVE A DEDICATED READING BUDDY OR TWO MY SO DOESN'T READ YEAH I KNOW AND THE BOOK CLUBS I JOINED ALL ENDED UP BEING DISMALLY DISAPPOINTING I DON'T SPEND MUCH TIME ONLINE SO ONLINE BOOK CLUBS USUALLY END UP FEELING MORE LIKE A CHORE THAN A REAL PLEASURE I COULD GET DOWN WITH AN EMAIL EXCHANGE OR EVEN BETTER AN ACTUAL PENAL I DID HAVE A PENAL BOOK BUDDY FOR AWHILE THAT WAS A REAL PLEASURE WE WOULD TAKE TURNS PICKING BOOKS THEN BREAK THE READING UP INTO MANAGEABLE SECTIONS TO ALLOW FOR THE SLOWER EXCHANGE OF SNAIL MAIL SAVORING THE BOOK AND THE DISCUSSION THIS WAY ADDED A NEW ELEMENT TO MY READING THAT I'VE MISSED
KEEP IN MIND IT'S WRITTEN AS HIS DEFENSE YOU ARE MEANT TO FEEL PITY FOR HIM BECAUSE THAT'S HOW HE THINKS HE CAN GET OUT OF THIS
HAVEN'T READ THAT ONE YET BUT DID RECENTLY READ PALE FIRE AND THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER NABOKOV SURELY WAS ONE VERY CLEVER MANUAL
I NEVER ONCE FELT PITY OR EVEN ROOTED FOR HIM LIKE ANOTHER PERSON SAID

THE WRITING WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT NOT ONCE DID I LET THAT MISJUDGE WHAT HUMBERT WAS TRYING TO DEFEND HE'S A SHITTY PERSON AND I'M NEVER READING IT AGAIN
WHILE I DIDN'T FEEL FONDNESS OR PITY FOR HUMBERT IT SORT OF HUMANIZED MY VIEW OF PEOPLE AND HELPED ME UNDERSTAND AND EMPATHIES NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE AND HOW IN SOME CASES PAST EXPERIENCES CAN PLAY A PROFOUND ROLE IN WHO YOU ARE AND OF COURSE MESS YOU UP
THE STRONGEST EMOTION I FELT THOUGH WAS FEAR CRIPPLING HELPLESSNESS FOR LO AND A SENSE OF BEING TRAPPED OF LIFE HAVING ENDED
I THINK NABOKOV WAS VERY CLEVER AT ONE LEVEL HE FORCES THE READER TO BREAK DOWN DEFINITIONS OF MORALITY DEFINED BY THE DUMBED MASS OF SOCIETY AS SOMETHING THAT SIMPLY IS BECAUSE IT IS AND AT THE OTHER LEVEL MAKES YOU REDEFINE IT MORALITY FROM WITHIN SOMETHING THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO SOCIETY
IT'S LIKE HE DESTROYS THIS SHITTY GAUDY BUILDING THAT LOOKS SHINY ON THE OUTSIDE BUT IS ABSOLUTELY ROTTEN WITHIN AND THEN CONSTRUCTS SOMETHING WITH CARE WITH SOUND BEAUTY RESOUNDING FROM WITHIN

HE'S VERY CLEVER HUMBERT MAKES A GREAT UNRELIABLE NARRATOR YOU KEEP CATCHING YOURSELF ROOTING FOR HIM AND REALISING WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS
THE PROTAGONIST HUBERT IS A PEDOPHILE

HUMBERT BESIDES THAT IS NOT A PEDOPHILE IN POPULAR USAGE THE WORD PEDOPHILIA IS OFTEN APPLIED TO ANY SEXUAL INTEREST IN UNDER S AND FAILS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ATTRACTION TO PREPUBESCENT AND PUBESCENT OR MINORS

OUR MAN HAS A FIXATION WITH NYMPHETS GIRLS AGED A NYMPHET IS A SEXUALLY PRECOCIOUS PUBESCENT GIRL

PEDOPHILIA OR PAEDOPHILIA IS A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER IN WHICH AN ADULT OR OLDER ADOLESCENT EXPERIENCES A PRIMARY OR EXCLUSIVE SEXUAL ATTRACTION TO PREPUBESCENT CHILDREN

BY ALL DEFINITION HE IS A HEBEPHILE
FEEL IT GAVE ME AN AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE
LOLITA WAS THE FIRST BOOK BY NABOKOV I READ AND I WAS DAZZLED BY HIS PROSE I WAS ALSO SURPRISED THAT I DIDN'T FEEL A MORAL CONFLICT WHILE BEING SOMEWHAT SYMPATHETIC TO HUMBERT HE KNOWS WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG AND LOATHES HIMSELF FOR GIVING IN TO HIS DESIRES AT THE END OF THE BOOK THOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME HE FINDS HIMSELF ABLE TO LOVE SOMEONE WHO IS NO LONGER A NYMPHET IT'S A SUBVERSIVE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE FACT THAT HE GAVE IN TO DESIRES THAT HE KNEW TO BE WRONG AND DAMAGING TO THEIR OBJECT ACTUALLY HAD THE UNFORESEEN EFFECT OF HUMANIZING HIM SO THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME HE FELT A GENUINE CONNECTION TO ANOTHER PERSON AS AN ADULT

MY EDITION HAD AN AFTERWORD BY NABOKOV WHERE HE SAYS THAT LOLITA WAS A CHALLENGE TO HIMSELF AND THAT HE HAD THOUGHT OF TWO MORE SCENARIOS THAT WOULD BE A SIMILAR CHALLENGE BOTH TO HIMSELF AND READERS BUT HE THOUGHT THEY'D NEVER GET PUBLISHED NOTE THAT HE THOUGHT THIS EVEN AFTER LOLITA WAS OUT WAS ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED ONE A HARMONIOUS INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE RESULTING IN A LARGE AND HARMONIOUS FAMILY THAT'S NOT IN THE LEAST DYSFUNCTIONAL AND TWO AN ATHEIST WHO WORKS HARD IS SUCCESSFUL AND A PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY AND DIES PEACEFULLY AT A RIPE OLD AGE SURROUNDED BY HIS LOVING FAMILY WHAT I FIND MOST SUBVERSIVE ABOUT LOLITA IS THIS ASSESSMENT NABOKOV MAKES IN THE AFTERWORD THAT IN THE US OF HIS TIME IT'S EASIER TO MAKE A PEDOPHILE A SYMPATHETIC CHARACTER THAN AN ATHEIST OR AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE
I READ LOLITA IN COLLEGE AND ONLY EXPERIENCED THE SORT OF CURIOUS UNEASE AGAIN WHILE READING AMERICAN PSYCHO A FEW MONTHS AGO TO ME THEY ARE CHALLENGING IN MUCH THE SAME WAY DROPPING US INTO THE FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE OF SOCIETY'S MOST HEINOUS INDIVIDUALS THE STYLE VARIES ONLY BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS DO
I LOVE LOLITA SO MUCH I THINK I ESPECIALLY LOVED IT BECAUSE I COULD REALLY RELATE TO HUMBERT I HOPE EVERYONE CAN AT LEAST APPRECIATE FEELINGS EVEN IF THEY THINK HE'S A MONSTER IT BREAKS MY HEART WHEN PEOPLE ACCUSE HIM OF LYING ABOUT HIS FEELINGS FOR SYMPATHY

I DON'T KNOW IF NABOKOV WAS A NYMPHOLEPT HIMSELF BUT HE SURE KNEW HOW TO WRITE ONE
GLAD YOU SEE THE BEAUTY IN PROSE BECAUSE THAT IS PRETTY MUCH THE POINT HE WAS AN ART FOR ART SAKES GUY AND ANY ABOUT MORALITY AND EVEN MORE A POLITICAL STANCE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM SMIRKING TO SOME DEGREE IMHO JOHN UPDIKE WAS VERY MUCH AN AMERICAN VLADIMIR AND BET YOU CAN READ HIM
I READ THE BOOK LAST YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I PICKED IT UP DURING SOME SALES WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING VERY WELL WHAT THE TOPIC WAS ASIDE FROM HUMBERT THAT IS DOING HIS DEFENSE ALL THROUGH THE NOVEL HIS DESIRE AND LOVE THE REAL THING IS THAT NABOKOV WITH HIS STYLE LEFT ME SPEECHLESS HE LITERALLY MAKES YOU PRISONER OF THIS WORLD OF THE THE MIND OF THE PROTAGONIST AND EVEN IF MANY THINGS YOU READ ARE WRONG YOU CAN'T STOP READING
HUBERT IS A VERY GOOD MANIPULATOR WHICH NOT ONLY DRIVES THE PLOT BUT ALSO GREATLY EFFECTS THE READERS INTERPRETATION OF THE NARRATIVE HE IS IN EFFECT CONVINCING THE READER AND HIMSELF THAT HE IS NOT DOING ANYTHING AS ABHORRENT AS IT REALLY IS

STUNNING PIECE OF LITERATURE
LOLITA IS A CLASSIC FOR A REASON IT'S VERY WELL WRITTEN AND NABOKOV KNOWS VERY MUCH WHAT HE'S DOING

HAVING SAID THAT I ALSO FOUND THE ENTIRE STORY TO BE A CHORE IT BECOMES AWFULLY REPETITIVE HUMBERT HONESTLY STARTED GETTING ON MY NERVES FOR HOW DESPERATE HE WAS TO DEMONSTRATE HIS PURE AND BEAUTIFUL AFFECTION OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO LONG-WINDED AT TIMES I FELT LIKE PRISONER TOO IN THAT SENSE AND STOCKHOLM SYNDROME NEVER SET IN

HERE'S THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF MY REVIEW ON GOODREADS THAT I STILL THINK SUMS UP MY FEELINGS PRETTY WELL

OVERALL THOUGH THIS NOVEL PAINED ME IT PAINED ME BECAUSE THE WRITING WAS OFTEN GREAT BUT IT WAS FULL OF EFFORT AND SLOG SO MUCH UNNECESSARY FILLER AND PROBLEMS OF PACING THE PLOT WAS UNINTERESTING AND DESPICABLE INSOFAR AS HOW DESPICABLE IT IS TO HEAR HUMBERT PRATTLE ON ABOUT HIS LIFELONG OBSESSION FOR PAGES THERE JUST SEEMED TO BE SOMETHING MISSING THE WHOLE TIME THAT NEVER ENGAGED ME HUMBERT IS THE SORT OF ACADEMIC WHO PUTS YOU TO SLEEP AFTER TEN MINUTES OF SPEAKING WITH HIM BECAUSE HIS MIND IS SO SINGULARLY FOCUSED SORRY JUST DON'T CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT YOU AND YOUR LOVE OF LOLITA AND NO AMOUNT OF IS GOING TO MAKE ME THINK OTHERWISE
LOLITA REALLY ANGERED ME AS ENGLISH WAS NOT NABOKOV FIRST LANGUAGE
WOW THIS IS REALLY BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN WAIT IS THAT OH THAT'S JUST WRONG BUT IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL BUT SO WRONG OKAY I'LL TRY TO HATE HUMBERT BUT HOW CAN I HATE SOMEONE SO GODDAMN FUN TO READ OKAY HE MADE A GOOD POINT THERE THAT WAS ALSO A GOOD POINT OH GOD I'M AGREEING WITH HIM HOW CAN I AGREE WITH THIS WHAT DOES THAT TELL ME ABOUT ME OH THAT WAS CLEVER MAYBE HE'S NOT SO BAD AFTER AL NOPE PEDOPHILE BUT SHE SEEMS SO WILLING MAYBE IT'S LOVE WAIT NO FUCK THAT SHE'S AGH
ITS A GOOD BOOK ITS A VERY AMERICAN NOVEL IN A LOT OF WAYS WHICH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE NABOKOV WAS SUCH AN OLD WORLD DUDE

ITS AN INTERESTING BOOK BECAUSE HE HAS HH BASICALLY PULL EVERY TRICK TO CHARM THE READER LIKE ALL THE LITERARY REFERENCES IN PARTICULAR THE REFERENCES TO POE EARLY IN THE NOVEL WHEN HH DISCUSSES HIS FIRST LOVE I READ AS AN EDUCATED PEDOPHILE ESSENTIALLY BULLSHITTING THE READER LIKE IF WE THINK ABOUT THE META OF THE NOVEL ITS AN ACCUSED MURDERER PEDOPHILE IN PRISON WRITING A STORY THAT PUTS HIM IN THE BEST LIGHT HE CAN MANAGE

FOR ME THE BOOK PEAKS WITH THE OPENING WHERE HH IS IN EUROPE MARRIED TO VALERIA ITS JUST ABSURD NONSENSE THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME LAUGH I THINK THE BOOK DRAGS A BIT ON THEIR LITTLE ROAD QUEST BUT NABOKOV GREAT WRITING HOLDS IT TOGETHER

ITS A GOOD BOOK BUT I RECOMMEND YOU READ IT AGAIN THE SECOND READING I RECKON ITS EASIER TO SEE THROUGH THE NARRATORS BULLSHIT AND TO SEE WHERE HE IS LYING OR PRESENTING HIMSELF IN AN ESPECIALLY KIND LIGHT
I THINK ITS A GREAT METAPHOR FOR THE POWER OF MANIPULATION IF A POET OR A SINGER IS A MASTER AND EXPRESSES HIS LOVE FOR A WOMAN DOES THAT MEAN HE LOVES HER MORE THAN THE MAN WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE ARTISTRY TO SHOW HER THAT WAY I DONT THINK SO
EVERY TIME I READ LOLITA I GET SOMETHING ELSE OUT OF IT IT'S ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE BOOKS I'VE EVER READ ALSO ONE OF IF NOT THE MOST FUCKED UP I WILL NEVER STOP IT PROBABLY ONCE A YEAR IT'S WRITTEN REALLY QUITE BEAUTIFULLY FOR A DEFENSE
I WAS SO ASTONISHED AND DISTURBED WHEN I FIRST READ IT THAT I ALWAYS INTENDED TO READ IT AGAIN SO I DID YEARS LATER AND KEPT A DETAILED READING JOURNAL HERE

I THINK I WAS EVEN MORE ASTONISHED THE SECOND TIME AROUND THE FINAL SENTENCE OF THE JOURNAL FOR THREE WEEKS NOW I VE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD READ OR THIS NOVEL BECAUSE WHAT NABOKOV DOES IS NOTHING SHORT OF BRILLIANT
YOU KNOW YOU ARE A GOOD WRITER WHEN YOU MAKE PEDOPHILIA OR HEBEPHILIA SOUND JUSTIFIABLE I ALMOST FELT BAD FOR TAKING SIDE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NARRATIVE I WAS PROBABLY MANIPULATED IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WAY
THAT LITTLE F ICON AND THE LITTLE TWITTERING BIRD AND THE REST JUST DON'T CLICK ON THEM AND TURN OFF ALERTS ON YOUR PHONE IF YOU'RE LIKE ME YOU MUST BE ABLE TO FIND OR MINUTES SOMEWHERE IN YOUR DAY THAT YOU WOULD OTHERWISE BE WASTING

RIGHT I'M TURNING THIS OFF NOW
FOR ME I TRY TO ALWAYS HAVE SOME READING MATERIAL HANDY I HAVE BOOKS TO READ IN MY CAR ON MY PHONE IN MY BAG AND TWO DIFFERENT THAT WAY WHEN I HIT A LULL IN MY SCHEDULE I HAVE SOMETHING TO READ I ALSO READ ON MEAL BREAKS IF I HAVE TIME BEFORE SLEEPING OR WHILE I'M WAITING FOR THINGS TO FINISH COOKING I SOMETIMES PURPOSELY SCHEDULE READING TIMES AN HOUR HERE OR A FEW HOURS THERE GOOD LUCK
AUDIOBOOKS ON MY COMMUTE AND WHILE DOING HOUSEWORK AND THE LIKE I USUALLY SAVE BOOKS I DON'T WANT TO READ OR HAD A HARD TIME GETTING INTO FOR THE AUDIO BOOKS THIS IS USUALLY MY WORK RELATED YA AND NONFICTION

I READ FOR AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE BED ON ROAD TRIPS WHILE WAITING FOR THE DR AND DURING FOOTBALL GAMES HUSBAND WATCHES A LOT OF FOOTBALL

PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY GIVING ME THE OLD I ONLY LIKE REAL BOOKS LINE AT WORK AND I KEEP TELLING THEM YOU GOTTA HAVE ONE OF EACH AT ALL TIMES I HAVE MY REAL BOOKS AT HOME AN AUDIO BOOK FOR WHEN I'M DRIVING CLEANING OR WORKING OUT AND AN BOOK ON MY PHONE FOR ALL THE OTHER TIMES I HAVE SPARE TIME
JUST WHENEVER I CAN I READ ON MY WAY TO WORK IN LINE AT THE BANK ANYTIME I HAVE TWO MINUTES TO MYSELF
I FEEL YOUR PAIN

UNIVERSITY CAN SUCK UP A LOT OF YOUR TIME BETWEEN ASSIGNMENTS CLASSES AND YOUR SOCIAL LIFE NOT TO MENTION SLEEP BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO MORE REALISTICALLY MAKE TIME

SO HERE'S MY ADVICE YOUR CLASSES ARE SCHEDULED YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME SORT OF ROUTINE WITH YOUR MEALS AND OR SOCIAL ACTIVITIES SO FOR THE REST OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES JUST SCHEDULE TIME FOR THEM THREE HOURS BETWEEN YOUR LAST CLASS AND DINNER DO YOUR HOMEWORK THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS IS TO SCHEDULE SOME TIME FOR READING MAYBE AN HOUR EVERY OTHER DAY OR EVEN EVERY DAY JUST MAKE SURE YOU STICK TO ALL THE PARTS OF YOUR HAVE MORE TIME THAN YOU THINK YOU DO
YOU DON'T FIND TIME TO DO THINGS YOU WANT TO DO YOU MAKE TIME IN MY CASE I GO TO BED MINUTES EARLIER THAN I NEED TO AND SPEND MINUTES IN BED READING BEFORE I SLEEP

IF THAT MEANS MINUTES LESS AT THE PUB GAMING REEDITING SO BE IT
THIS IS MY TYPICAL READING DAY AUDIOBOOK AFTER DROPPING OFF KIDS AT DAYCARE LUNCH AUDIOBOOK TO FOOD TRUCK READ PHYSICAL BOOK ABOUT MINUTES LONGER IF I BROUGHT MY LUNCH FROM HOME AUDIOBOOK BACK TO THE OFFICE AUDIOBOOK TO PICK UP KIDS AND WIFE POLITICAL PODCASTS ON WAY HOME W FAMILY WHILE COOKING READ PHYSICAL BOOK ON TREADMILL MINS KIDS ASLEEP BY WIFE IN BED BY READ PHYSICAL BOOK FROM I FALL ASLEEP

ALL WHILE TRYING TO IGNORE REDDIN AND FACEBOOK WITH MODEST AMOUNTS OF SUCCESS
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT NOT HAVING TOO MUCH TIME MY GOODREADS READING CHALLENGE THIS YEAR WAS FOR THAT REASON FULL TIME JOB DRIVING COMMUTE TWIN YEAR OLDS AT HOME YEAH NOT MUCH DOWN TIME

I DO HOWEVER DEDICATE HOUR A NIGHT TO READING BEFORE BED I FIND IT HELPS ME SLEEP WHICH MAKES ME MORE PRODUCTIVE THE NEXT DAY THE ONLY OTHER TIME THAT I GET TO READ IS ON WEEKENDS WHEN THE KIDS NAP UNLESS I AM REALLY DRAINED AND NEED A NAP MYSELF
I KEEP MY BOOKS ON MY PHONE SO I ALWAYS HAVE THEM WITH ME I ALSO KEEP THE BOOK WIDGET FRONT AND CENTER SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING I SEE AND I AM MORE LIKELY TO CLICK ON THAT THAN GO TO FACEBOOK OR PLAY MY GAMES I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T ENJOY READING ON SUCH SMALL DEVICES BUT I USUALLY ONLY GET MINUTES TO READ AT A SHOT SO IT WORKS WELL I TEND TO READ WHILE WALKING TO AND FROM WHERE I NEED TO GO IT'S A BIT DANGEROUS IF OTHER PEOPLE ARE AROUND THOUGH SO BE CAREFUL OTHERWISE IF I GET TO TO WHERE I NEED TO BE AND I'M A BIT EARLY I'LL OPEN UP MY PHONE I ALSO TEND TO FIND A QUIET CORNER AT LUNCH AND HUNKER DOWN FOR A BIT WITH SOME FOOD AND READ THEN DEFINITELY NOT THE SAME AS BEING ABLE TO SIT IN A COMFY CHAIR AND READ BUT IF YOU CAN DO FIND AN THAT WILL SYNC BETWEEN SCREENS AND YOU CAN PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF ON A BIGGER MORE COMFORTABLE DEVICE
I DON'T WATCH TV I DON'T REALLY SEE MANY MOVIES I DON'T PLAY VIDEO GAMES BOOKS ARE MY ENTERTAINMENT

I ALSO READ EVERYWHERE I HAVE AN EXTRA COUPLE OF MINUTES KIDS HOCKEY PRACTICE WAITING ROOMS LINES AT THE MTO DURING MY LUNCH I ALSO HAVE A MESSY HOUSE AND MY KIDS RUN WILD
IF I'M NOT TOO TIRED I JUST TRY TO READ AN HOUR EVERY NIGHT IF I'M ALREADY TOO TIRED THERE IS NO POINT REALLY IT ALSO HELPS TO READ THINGS THAT REALLY DRAW YOU IN AND ARE MAYBE NOT SUPER DIFFICULT TO READ I DO LIKE TO READ DIFFICULT THINGS EVERY NOW AND THEN BUT SOMETIMES I FIND IT HARD TO PICK UP THE BOOK SO SOMETHING THAT CAN BE READ EASILY IS GREAT

I HOPE THIS HELPS YOU OUT IN SOME WAY I'M A SLOW READER SO I DON'T REALLY GET MUCH FURTHER THAN ABOUT PAGES IN THAT HOUR BUT THAT'S OK FOR ME
I TAKE THEM ON THE GO IN AN APPARENTLY OR READ BEFORE BED
I SET ASIDE AN HOUR A DAY TO READ BEFORE BED USUALLY PM IS FOR READING THEN I WATCH SOME TV UNTIL PM BEFORE FALLING ASLEEP
I'M JUST ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING I LISTEN TO PODCASTS DRAW WORK OUT TRAIN MY DOG READ HIKE PLAY TOO MUCH OVERWATCH AND FIRE EMBLEM LEARN DANISH WORK HOURS IMPROVE MY R SKILLS STUDY FOR ACTUARIAL EXAMS AND DO STUFF WITH MY BEST IN THE BIBLE GALATIANS

I'VE ONLY READ ABOUT BOOKS THIS YEAR INCLUDING GRAPHIC NOVELS BUT GROUPING THINGS LIKE SAGA LOCKE AND KEY ETC AS ONE WORK BUT I'M SATISFIED WITH THAT I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LEARN ABOUT NEW AUTHORS OR NEW MUSIC ANY MORE BUT SACRIFICES MUST BE MADE

I DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON ANY ONE THING BESIDES CODING AND ACTUARY STUFF BUT I ALWAYS SPEND TIME ON SOMETHING
I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT FOR ME THE BEST METHOD I'VE FOUND IS TO LISTEN TO AUDIOBOOKS FOR MY OWN ENJOYMENT WHAT TIME I DO HAVE FOR READING IS ALL USED UP ON TEXTBOOKS
IF YOU WANT TO DO IT YOU MAKE TIME FOR IT MAYBE YOU CAN IDENTIFY A TIME WHERE YOU JUST DON'T DO THE BEST SCHOOLWORK THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TIME TO SET ASIDE FOR PLEASURE READING THAT COULD BE A HALF HOUR WHILE YOU'RE HAVING COFFEE IN THE MORNING OR TELL YOURSELF I WON'T GET MUCH OUT OF DOING SCHOOLWORK RIGHT NOW SO I'LL READ THAT GREAT BOOK
DURING MY LUNCHES AT WORK I STOPPED READING FOR CLASS AND NOW READ SOMETHING THAT I AM ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN AS A FUN READ IT WAS GETTING EMBARRASSING TO WORK IN A LIBRARY BUT NOT HAVE READ ANYTHING NEWER THAT I CAN RECOMMEND WHEN ASKED WHAT ARE YOU READING WHEN I HAVE AN HOUR FOR LUNCH THERE IS NO REASON I CAN'T SPEND THAT MINUTES NOT EATING OF IT AS ME READING TIME
I READ WHENEVER I HAVE ANY DOWN TIME EVEN IF IT'S ONLY MINUTES NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT I DON'T READ AT LEAST A LITTLE I'M A SINGLE MOM AND I WORK FULL-TIME SO I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FREE TIME BUT WHENEVER I DO I HAVE MY FACE IN A BOOK

I GUESS MY BIGGEST TRICK IS READING IN BED IT HELPS ME UNWIND AT THE END OF A BUSY DAY KIDS ARE TUCKED IN I BRUSH MY TEETH AND GET MY PJ'S ON AND I READ IN BED FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP

EDIT WHEN I'M EATING ALONE I READ THEN TOO
LISTENING TO AUDIBLE BOOKS HELPS ALSO HELPS TO OCCUPY YOUR MIND WHEN YOU'RE COMMUTING MASS TRANSIT PREFERABLY OR WORKING OUT AT THE GYM
ALWAYS KEEP YOUR BOOK ON YOU FLIP IT OPEN ON TRANSIT ON LUNCH BREAKS WHILE STANDING IN LINE FOR SOMETHING WHILE WAITING FOR A FRIEND WHILE EATING
IM ALSO A VERY BUSY
UNIVERSITY STUDENT AND ALWAYS JUST READ WHEN I'M PROCRASTINATING THIS IS MAYBE BAD ADVICE BUT WHEN I SHOULD BE DOING HOMEWORK AND AM INSTEAD DOING REDDIN OR FACEBOOK I READ INSTEAD I FIGURE IT'S BETTER USE OF MY PROCRASTINATION AND IT'S ALSO EASIER FOR ME TO SAY AFTER TWO CHAPTERS I HAVE TO DO SOME WORK THAN IT IS TO SAY MINUTES OF REDDIN THEN BACK TO WORK
I STOPPED READING FOR PLEASURE DURING COLLEGE THERE ARE TIMES IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO AND I CHOSE TO SAY NO TO READING I WAS ALREADY WRITING PAPERS AND READING CHEMISTRY BOOKS ETC I PICKED UP THE HABIT AGAIN LATER BUT I HAVE FRIENDS TRY TO FIT EVERYTHING IN BUT YOU HAVE TO SAY NO TO SOME THINGS IT MIGHT NOT BE READING BUT THERE ARE SO MANY HOURS IN THE DAY

I PERSONALLY LIKE LISTENING TO AUDIOBOOKS DURING MY COMMUTES AND I LIKE TO READ ABOUT MINUTES BEFORE I GO TO BED AND THAT'S USUALLY JUST STOPPING MY SOCIAL MEDIA BROWSING EARLIER
AS MUCH AS I LOVE PAPER BASED BOOKS IT'S TOO HARD FINDING THE TIME TO CARRY IT AROUND AND FINDING A SPACE WHERE I CAN READ IT HOWEVER I LIVE THROUGH THE KINDLE CLOUD READER BEING ABLE TO READ THEM ON A COMPUTER WHEN I'VE NOTHING I NEED TO DO AT WORK IS A GODSEND I AVERAGE TWO TO THREE BOOKS A MONTH AND THE BEST PART I GET PAID TO READ FRONT DESK AT A HOTEL IF WONDERING
LIKE MANY HAVE SAID I READ WHENEVER I CAN I READ DURING MY LUNCH BREAK AT WORK AND I ALWAYS MAKES SURE I READ BEFORE I GO TO BED EVEN IF ONLY A CHAPTER OR TWO I ALWAYS HAVE A BOOK WITH ME WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL OR COLLEGE I WOULD READ BEFORE CLASS DURING BREAKS ETC

KILL YOUR TELEVISION LIKE RIGHT NOW

ALSO GET DIVORCED AND CEDE FULL CUSTODY TO YOUR EX
I GET MY READING DONE IN BITS WHEREVER I CAN

WAITING FOR OR ON PUBLIC TRANSIT

IN THE WAITING ROOM THEY TEND TO HAVE VERY LIMITED READING MATERIAL IF ANY

AND ON MY LUNCH BREAKS

I ALSO TRY TO READ FICTION OR A BIOGRAPHY FOR MINUTES BEFORE GOING TO BED TO RELAX
MY DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES TEND TO BE EITHER READING OR SOME SORT OF MEDIA RELATED PROGRAM ON MY PHONE OR COMPUTER I TAKE A TRAIN INTO SCHOOL AND DEVOTE THAT TIME TO READING EVERY DAY AND MOST DAYS BEFORE BED I SNEAK IN A BIT IT HELPS TO MAKE A ROUTINE AND AVOID THE LITTLE TIME SUCKERS HAHA
I READ ON THE BUS FROM MY HOUSE TO THE UNIVERSITY THAT'S LIKE HOUR A DAY SOMETIMES MORE IF THERE'S A TRAFFIC IN AUTHOR NAMES JAMIESON AND I ALWAYS CARRY THE BOOK BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT SOMETHING AND READ
I HATE WAITING THEREFORE ANY TIME I FIND MYSELF WAITING GROCERY STORE DMV DENTIST'S OFFICE I IMMEDIATELY GO TO MY KINDLE APP ON MY PHONE AND READ A BOOK I HAVE JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE FOR A WHILE NOW THAT BOOK HAS BEEN THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

I NO LONGER WAIT FOR ANYTHING I JUST GET TIME TO READ THAT BOOK
DELETE ALL YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILES IF YOU CAN'T DON'T INSTALL THEIR APPS ON YOUR PHONE STAY AWAY FROM THE TV READ REGULARLY
BEFORE GOING TO BED FOR EXAMPLE
HAVING A KINDLE PAPER-WHITE HELPS I CAN BRING IT ANYWHERE NO MATTER HOW HEFTY THE BOOK IS IT FITS IN EVERY BAG PURSE I HAVE I CAN DOWNLOAD THE NEXT BOOK IN A SERIES THE MOMENT I FINISH THE PREVIOUS ONE THOUGH THIS CAN GET DANGEROUS IT HAS A BUILT IN BOOK LIGHT SO I CAN READ IN BED WITHOUT BOTHERING MY PARTNER

I READ EVERYWHERE ON MY LUNCH BREAK IN LINE AT THE GROCERY STORE IN THE WAITING ROOM AT THE DR WHEN I GET HOME FROM WORK AND UNWIND BEFORE BED ALL IN ALL I'M ABLE TO GET IN 2 HOURS OF READING PER DAY OR MORE EVEN THOUGH I WORK FULL TIME
IT'S PRETTY HARD BUT THERE IS ALWAYS TIME YOU JUST GOTT FIND IT LAST FALL SEMESTER MY F AND I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL MASTERS FOR HER BACHELOR'S FOR ME AT FIRST WE WERE DOING WELL BUT BY MID SEMESTER WE REALIZED THAT WE WERE GETTING BIST PLAIN BURNED OUT ALL IT WAS WAS WAKE UP GO TO SCHOOL COME HOME STUDY SLEEP AND REPEAT WE FIN ALLY DECIDED THAT WE WOULD PUT MINUTES ASIDE EVERY EVENING TURN THE TV OFF CLOSE OUR SCHOOL BOOKS MAKE TEA AND READ FOR AT LEAST MINUTES IT GOT TO THE POINT THAT WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO IT ALL DAY EVEN IF YOU SET ASIDE MINUTES A DAY TO READ YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT HOW MUCH YOU CAN GET DONE
HAVE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH YOUR DAY A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME HOW I GET SO MUCH TIME TO READ AND HONESTLY IT'S JUST MY PRIORITY I ALWAYS HAVE A BOOK IN MY BAG I READ ON THE BUS ON MY LUNCH BREAK WHILE I'M WAITING FOR APPOINTMENTS AND WHILE I'M WINDING DOWN IN BED INSTEAD OF GAMING OR PLAYING ON YOUR PHONE OR WATCHING TV READ YOU WON'T BE STUDYING SO JUST HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR DOWNTIME INSTEAD OF READING AND REASSESS
I WORK FROM HOME SO MY SCHEDULE IS A LITTLE MORE LENIENT BUT IT'S STILL PRETTY BUSY IN GENERAL I TEND TO TAKE THREE BREAKS FROM THE DAY EACH DAY TO READ A BIT WITH A DRINK AND OR A SNACK

THESE ARE SHORTLY AFTER WAKING DEAL WITH EMAILS URGENT BUSINESS THEN GO SIT DOWN AND READ WITH SOME OJ AFTER DINNER BEER AND A BOOK THIS ONE'S USUALLY A BIT LONGER OF A BREAK AND A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE BED THIS ONE CAN ALSO BE A BIT LONGER DEPENDING ON IF I'VE GOT MORE WORK TO DO BEFORE SLEEPING OR IF I'M JUST GONNA FUCK AROUND WITH REDDIN AND GAMES

I'M A PRETTY SLOW READER SO EVEN WITH THREE BITS OF MY DAY TO READ IT STILL TAKES ME A WHILE TO GET THROUGH A LENGTHY BOOK BUT IT'S ALWAYS A NICE BREAK FROM GOING ON THAT DAY I TRY NOT TO TOUCH MY PHONE UNLESS I GET A TEXT OR EMAIL THIS WAS HARDER IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION ESPECIALLY AFTER WAKING UP I HAD TO KNOW WHAT I'D MISSED AND IT'S JUST REALLY RELAXING THEN IT'S BACK TO WORK INTERMITTENTLY MIXED WITH OTHER FORMS OF PROCRASTINATION UNTIL THE NEXT BOOK BREAK
THIS POSTED A LOT IT'S KIND OF A DUMB QUESTION IMO YOU JUST FIND THE TIME OR YOU MAKE IT OR YOU DON'T HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU SLEEP A NIGHT THE WHOLE HOURS THINGS KIND OF BULLSHIT
WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE I FOUND THAT I GOT A LOT OF FUN READING DONE AROUND MIDTERMS AND FINALS
THERE ARE USUALLY CERTAIN PERIODS THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHEN WE HAVE FEWER DEMANDS ON OUR TIME FOR ME THAT'S FIRST THING IN THE MORNING RIGHT BEFORE BED AND AT THE END OF MY WORK DAY SO THAT'S WHEN MOST OF MY READING GETS DONE

I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR OLD TIME SLOT WAS BUT IT COULD ALSO BE THAT RIGHT NOW YOU JUST CAN'T READ AS MUCH AS YOU USED TO IF I CAN GET TWO MINUTE BLOCKS OF READING THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD DAY READING ANY MORE THAN THAT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO NEGLECT SOMETHING ELSE THAT I CONSIDER IMPORTANT AND I WON'T DO THAT
OTHERS HAVE SAID IT BUT AUDIOBOOKS HAVE BEEN A GODSEND I LISTEN TO THEM ON MY COMMUTE AND EVEN SOMETIMES AT MY DESK AT WORK WITH HEADPHONES IN

I MIGHT BE WEIRD FOR THIS BUT I ALSO BUY A PHYSICAL COPY TO READ WHEN I ACTUALLY DO HAVE TIME SOMETIMES I'LL EVEN READ ALONG WHILE I LISTEN TO THE BOOK ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A VERY GOOD NARRATOR
TURN OFF YOUR PHONE AND READ BEFORE BED INSTEAD OF CHECKING YOUR DEVICES
SAME PROBLEM HERE UNIVERSITY WORKLOAD SEEMS OVERWHELMING BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO RESERVE TIME FOR READING KEEP BOOKS IN YOUR PHONE SO YOU CAN READ ON THE WAITING FOR THE PROFESSOR TO ARRIVE OR WHEN YOU HAVE BREAKS START A HABIT OF READING FOR A FEW MINUTES A DAY FROM MINUTES GRADUALLY INCREASE IT TO MINUTES OR YOU CAN HAVE AROUND HOURS DURING WEEKENDS RESERVED FOR READING A FEW HOURS WOULDN'T HURT YOUR GA
AUDIBLE PRETTY MUCH STOPPED READING THINGS THAT WEREN'T WORK RELATED FOR YEARS AND THIS SET ME STRAIGHT VERY CONVENIENT AND HAS DRIVEN ME TO READ MORE PHYSICAL BOOKS AS WELL
I BRING WHATEVER BOOK I AM READING AT THE TIME WITH ME EVERYWHERE I TRY TO GET TO CLASS MINUTES EARLY AND I USE THAT TIME FOR READING SOME OF THE BOOK BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A CAR AND I BUS EVERYWHERE I PULL MY BOOK OUT TO READ WHILE RIDING THE BUS I READ DURING MY LUNCH BREAK AT WORK I EVEN READ DURING BREAKFAST OR DINNER IF I AM LONE WOLFING IT FOR THAT ANY MINUTE I CAN GET I READ I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE HABIT OF READING BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP AND THIS HAS FALLEN A BIT SINCE BEING IN UNI BUT WHEN I CAN I DO THAT AS WELL ALSO BREAKS ARE YOUR BEST FRIEND I READ MOST OF MY GOODREADS CHALLENGE DURING MY BREAKS AND SHORT BOOKS ARE HELPFUL ON THAT LIKE AGATHA CHRISTIE IS AWESOME TO READ BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD BUT SHORT BOOKS
WHY HAVE IT REMOVED JUST BECAUSE IT MAY MAKE SOMEONE ELSE UNCOMFORTABLE

BETTER TO READ AND DISCUSS IT AS A GROUP POINTING OUT THE WAYS IN WHICH IT'S OUTDATED AND THE WAYS IN WHICH IT'S STILL RELEVANT

CURRENT EVENTS SHOWS IS QUITE CLEARLY THAT YOU CAN'T END HATRED BY BURYING IT AS IT'LL ALWAYS BUBBLE UP AGAIN BUT YOU CAN DISCUSS IT OPENLY AND INTELLIGENTLY TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO BETTER REFUTE SUCH MESSAGES THEY SEE IN THE FUTURE

COLLEGE ISN'T ABOUT BEING SAFE AND PROTECTED IT'S ABOUT LEARNING HOW THE WORLD WORKS HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY MAKE YOUR WAY IN IT AND HOW TO BE AN INTELLIGENT INFORMED AND PRODUCTIVE ADULT

YOU DON'T GET THERE BY HIDING FROM REALITY
I WOULD HOPE THAT ANY PERSON IN COLLEGE THAT VOLUNTARILY TOOK THAT COURSE PROBABLY BEING FULLY AWARE OF THE READING REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE CAPABLE OF VOICING THEIR OWN OPINIONS ON IT TOWARDS THE PROFESSOR IF THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE BOOK

BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT OUTDATED VIEWS ARE GOING TO SURPRISE MANY WHO SIGN UP TO A MEDIEVAL ENGLISH LITERATURE COURSE FURTHERMORE TAKING A COURSE ON MEDIEVAL ENGLISH LITERATURE IS ALL ABOUT LEARNING WHAT PEOPLE WROTE ABOUT DURING THE MIDDLE AGES READING ABOUT OUTDATED VIEWS AND DISCUSSING THOSE WORKS IS PART OF THAT

PERSONALLY I WOULD FEEL EXTREMELY CHEATED AS A COLLEGE STUDENT THAT CHOSE TO TAKE A MEDIEVAL ENGLISH LITERATURE COURSE IF WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT AT LEAST PARTS OF CANTERBURY TALES
FIRSTLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET MUCH SUPPORT ON THIS FROM REDDIN BECAUSE REDDIN IN GENERAL AND R BOOKS IN PARTICULAR ARE VERY MUCH AGAINST BOOK BANNING AND THE REMOVAL OF BOOKS BECAUSE THEY MIGHT OFFEND SOMEBODY

MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT ATTITUDES TOWARDS WOMEN AND MINORITIES HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE WAY THEY ARE NOW LET ALONE THE WAY WE MIGHT LIKE THEM TO BE IF THERE IS ANYBODY WHO IS OFFENDED BY THE WAY WOMEN WERE WRITTEN ABOUT OVER YEARS AGO ENGLISH LIT MAY NOT BE FOR THEM STUDYING A PIECE OF WRITING IN NO WAY REQUIRES AGREEING WITH IT AND THE OUTDATED ATTITUDES IN WRITINGS MAY WELL EVEN BE A TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION DURING THE CLASSICAL BURYING OUR CULTURAL PAST DOES NOT STOP IT FROM EXISTING

BESIDES WHICH REMOVING CHAUCER ONE OF THE GREATER ENGLISH WRITERS GENERALLY AND PROBABLY THE GREATEST OF HIS TIME THE FIRST TO BE BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY'S POETS CORNER AND ONE OF THE FIRST WRITERS TO WRITE IN ENGLISH VERNACULAR FROM A MEDIEVAL ENGLISH LIT CLASS IS A FRANKLY LUDICROUS SUGGESTION BY ALL MEANS HAVE A CHAT WITH THE PROFESSOR ABOUT THE WAY IT IS HANDLED BUT EXPECT TO BE SHOT DOWN IF YOU ASK FOR IT TO BE REMOVED
MAYBE INSTEAD OF MAKING AN INCONVENIENCE FOR EVERYONE ELSE YOU SHOULD JUST SWITCH CLASSES
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN READING IT IN SCHOOL FOR A LONG TIME I'M SURE YOU'LL ALL MAKE IT THROUGH JUST FINE LIKE THE OTHER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
IF THEY'RE NOT OFFENDED BY IT WHY ARE YOU IT WAS WRITTEN HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO WHEN TIMES AND THOUGHTS WERE FAR DIFFERENT FROM TODAY READ IT DO THE WORK AND MOVE ON YOU HAVE NO NEED TO BE OFFENDED ON SOMEONE BEHALF
I AM GIVING YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND SAYING IT'S OKAY IGN FOR THIS TROLLING I'VE SEEN YOU HERE BEFORE

THIS IS SOME DUMB FUCKING SHIT RIGHT HERE

CHAUCER LITERALLY HAD THREE CONSECUTIVE TALES REGARDING THE ROLE OF WOMEN AND THE END RESULT IE THE ONE PRESENT IN THE BEST LIGHT IS THE ONE OF MUTUAL RESPECT AND UNDERSTANDING

THE CLERK WHO GOES ON AND ON ABOUT THE WICKEDNESS OF WOMEN IS PRESENTED AS A SPINELESS NINNY AND AN NEUROTIC IDIOT

THE WIFE OF BATH WHO GOES ON AND ON ABOUT HOW MEN ARE IDIOTS IS PRESENTED AS SELFISH AND MANIPULATIVE

THE FRANKLIN WHO TAKES THE MIDDLE GROUND IS WHILE NOT AN EXEMPLAR LIKE THE KNIGHT PARSON OR PLOWMAN IS A PRETTY GREAT GUY REGARDLESS

DID YOU NOT NOTICE THE POINTED CRITICISM OF THE CHURCH TOO CHAUCER WAS NO FOOL A PRODUCT OF HIS TIMES YES BUT SO IS LITERALLY EVERY OTHER FUCKING PERSON ON THE PLANET AND HE WAS STILL ONE OF THE BEST

THAT'S SOME COMMUNIST LEVEL SHIT RIGHT THERE
AM I THE ONLY ONE FEELING TROLLED BY SOMEONE WHO HATES THE SO-CALLED SAWS
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY EITHER MISGUIDED IN THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY WORK OF MEDIEVAL ENGLISH LITERATURE WOULD FLUNK A MODERN VALUES TEST WITH RESPECT TO WOMEN OR JUDAISM OR A FLAME NOTE THAT IT'S LATE NOVEMBER AND AN ODD TIME TO QUIBBLE OVER THE SYLLABUS OF A COLLEGE COURSE

BUT HYPOTHETICALLY LET'S SAY PREVENTING SPECULATIVE OFFENSE IS SUDDENLY A WORTHWHILE GOAL NOT THAT IT'S A COMPETITION BUT CANTERBURY TALES IS TERRIBLY RELENTLESSLY OFFENSIVE TO CORRUPT MEMBERS OF THE CATHOLIC HIERARCHY WERE THERE ANY LEGITIMATE REASON TO STRIKE THE BOOK BECAUSE FEMALES AND JEWISH PEOPLE MIGHT READ IT AND BE OFFENDED WE HAD DARN WELL ALSO INCLUDE ANY AMORAL EXPLOITATIVE CLERGY WHO HAPPEN TO BE TAKING THE COURSE SO THEY NOT FEEL EXCLUDED FROM DUE PROTECTIONS
LOL NUMBER SINCE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT SEEMS TO WANT TO TAKE ACTION EVEN BEFORE YOU READ IT REALLY I WOULD SUGGEST TAKING AN ACTION ONLY YOU SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DROP THE CLASS
IF YOU'RE GOING TO CLUTCH YOUR PEARLS EVERY TIME YOU READ A BOOK THAT DOESN'T MEET YOUR PURITY STANDARDS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME YOU CAN FIND ANY NUMBER OF BOOKS WRITTEN TODAY THAT CAN BE UPSETTING AS WELL AS TV MOVIES AND MUSIC

IF NO ONE ELSE IS OFFENDED HAVE YOU ASKED I'D JUST BUCK UP AND READ IT OR CHANGE CLASSES
A BOOK MAY SAY OFFENSIVE STUFF BUT THE ACTION TO DEAL WITH IT SHOULD ONLY BE THAT OF PEOPLE DIRECTLY OFFENDED NEVER READ THE BOOK BUT I'M ASSUMING IT'S OLDER AND THEREFORE WILL HAVE OUTDATED VIEWS
BOOKS LIKE THIS ACTUALLY LEAD TO THE BEST DISCUSSIONS I THINK
READING SHOULD TAKE YOU OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE AND TEACH YOU ABOUT HISTORY SPECIFICALLY HOW PEOPLE THOUGHT IN THE PAST NO ONE WOULD READ ANYTHING EVER IF IT WAS A MATTER OF COMFORT
ITS A MEDIEVAL CLASS THAT SHIT HAPPENED BACK THEN IT'S PART OF HISTORY NO MATTER HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS EDUCATING PEOPLE ON THE GOOD AND THE BAD OF OUR HISTORY IS IMPORTANT IF IT OFFENDS YOU OR OTHER PEOPLE DON'T TAKE THE CLASSICAL ERASING SOME ONES STRUGGLES FROM HISTORY AND NOT TEACHING IT IS MORE OFFENSIVE IN MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH SAYING IT DOESN'T MATTER ENOUGH TO BE TAUGHT

TOUGHEN UP
PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS A TROLL POST

EDIT YUP
TALK ABOUT WHY THE THEMES ARE WRONG DON'T JUST GET THE BOOK BANNED THAT DOESN'T HELP ANYBODY
IF YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT SPEAK TO THE PROFESSOR BUT DON'T PUT HER IN THE AWKWARD POSITION OF HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY SHE WILL NOT BE REMOVING SOMETHING THAT'S PROBABLY BEEN ON THE CURRICULUM FOR SEVERAL TIMES AS LONG AS YOU'VE BEEN ALIVE

PERHAPS ONCE YOU'VE DISCUSSED WITH YOUR PROFESSOR THAT YOU THINK SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE ISSUES WITH THE CONTENT AND SHE DECIDES TO POWER THROUGH YOU CAN BRING UP IN CLASS AS A DISCUSSION HOW CHANGING VIEWS MAY MAKE WHAT ONCE WAS POPULAR NOW SEEM OFFENSIVE AND HURTFUL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A HELPFUL INSIGHTFUL DISCUSSION TOPIC THAT I WOULD ENJOY BEING A FLY ON THE WALL FOR
JUST DON'T FIRST OF ALL IT'S UP TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT POTENTIALLY BE OFFENDED TO SPEAK UP FOR THEMSELVES IF IT BOTHERS THEM SECOND I THINK PART OF THE WHOLE POINT OF READING BOOKS FROM OTHER TIME PERIODS AND PLACES IS TO GET A SLICE OF LIFE FROM WHAT IT WAS LIKE LIVE THEN OR THERE AND TALK ABOUT THE CULTURE AT THE TIME AND HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED IT'S CRITICAL FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS WERE NOT ALWAYS AS THEY ARE NOW IF YOU CONVINCE THE PROFESSOR TO REMOVE IT YOU ROB THEM OF THAT EXPERIENCE
I CAN'T EVEN I DIDN'T THINK I HAD ANY TRIGGERS AND HAVE EVEN MOCKED THIS TIGGER WARNING CULTURE YOU JUST FOUND MINE I'M REALLY NOT MEANING TO BELITTLE YOU YOU MIGHT JUST BE NEW TO UPPER LEVEL LITERAL CLASSES YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE A GOOD HEART

BEGIN RANT

NEVER ASK TO BAN A BOOK EVER HE'S NOT TELLING YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO APPROVE OR AGREE YOU ARE IN COLLEGE AS SUCH YOU MUST READ LITERATURE THAT IS CHALLENGING TO YOUR MORALS OR BELIEFS YOU MUST READ WORKS THAT OFFEND YOU IN ORDER TO EXPRESS WHAT OFFENDS YOU AND WHY

DON'T GET SOMETHING BANNED BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE OR SPEAK FOR THEM WOMEN AND OPPRESSED MINORITIES ARE USED TO THIS TYPE OF LITERAL WE JEWS ARE USED TO IT I DO NOT THINK ANYONE WILL BE SWAYED TO THINK OF ME AS A SHYLOCK BECAUSE THEY READ MERCHANT OF VENICE I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS GOING TO THINK THAT IT'S OKAY TO RAPE ME BECAUSE THEY READ AMERICAN PSYCHO BUT I DO THINK IT'S OKAY IF THEY APPRECIATE WHITNEY DANCE WITH SOMEBODY A LITTLE MORE I KNOW I DO IT'S NOTHING NEW IF THERE ARE ANY BLACK PEOPLE IN YOUR AMERICAN LIT CLASS WILL YOU ASK TO BAN THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN BECAUSE THE IS CONSTANTLY DROPPED IF YOU STAND BEHIND YOUR READING THEN WOULDN'T IT BE IMPORTANT TO APPLY THESE UNIVERSAL IF OFFENSIVE PLOTS THEMES AND SYMBOLS OF PATRIARCHAL POWER AND OPPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE REST OF YOUR READINGS THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF LITERATURE THIS IS A SEMINOLE WORK A LOT OF LIT BUILDS FROM IT HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WESTERN LITERATURE IF YOU DON'T READ THE CANTERBURY TALES

HOW CAN YOU LEARN HOW TO THINK CRITICALLY AND ARGUE WITHOUT ANALYZING AND UNDERSTANDING OFFENSIVE LITERATURE THIS IS A WORK THAT OFTEN INSPIRES DEBATE AROUND ISSUES OF FEMINIST AND VALUES IN LITERAL ASK YOURSELF WHY ARE THESE PLOTS AND TROPES IN THE WORK

THIS IS A MEDIEVAL LITERATURE CLASSICAL THIS IS THIS WHAT WAS IN MEDIEVAL LITERATURE

THESE THEMES ARE IN SHAKESPEARE THE BIBLE ETC SLOWLY WESTERN CIV HAS EVOLVED INTO A MORE POLITICALLY CORRECT CULTURE OFTEN LESS OFFENSIVE BECAUSE OF WORKS LIKE THE CANTERBURY TALES IF YOU DIDN'T READ ANYTHING THAT WAS REMOTELY OFFENSIVE WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE LEFT HOW CAN WE ANALYZE THE VALUES FEARS HISTORY EVOLUTION OF THE TIME IF WE DON'T READ ABOUT THE VALUES

REFERRING DIRECTLY TO ANTISEMITISM AND RAPE IN CANTERBURY TALES CONSIDER SATIRE NOW READ AGAIN

WHERE'S THE LINE BETWEEN SHINING LIGHT ON THE DARK SHADOWS OR OVERLOOKED OFFENSES THAT ARE CONSTANTLY IN OUR FACES AND CENSORSHIP

YOUR BOOKLIFT FAHRENHEIT BRAVE NEW WORLD TITUS ANDRONICUS LITERARY THEORY AN INTRODUCTION ALL THE HAROLD BLOOM YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON USE YOUR ASTOR TO READ AS MANY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON CHAUCER AS POSSIBLE PICK OUT ONE BOOK ON THE BANNED BOOKS LIST THAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE BULGER TO YOU OR OTHERS READ IT THEN WRITE A CRITICAL ESSAY ABOUT THE PURPOSE OR LACK THERE OF FOR THE OFFENSIVE CONTENTION

END RANT

SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YOU NEED TO TAKE AT LEAST A FEW DAYS TO THINK THIS THROUGH ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE AN ENGLISH OR ED MAJOR YOUR PROFESSOR WILL PROBABLY THINK LESS OF YOU OR JUST THINK YOU ARE UNEDUCATED OR NAIVE WHILE TRYING NOT TO OFFEND YOU MY HUSBAND'S AN ENGLISH PROF SO THIS IS HOW IT TYPICALLY GOES WITH HIM IN THESE SITUATIONS PERHAPS HE WILL GIVE YOU A MORE THOUGHTFUL LESSON ABOUT THIS THAN MY TRIGGERED RANT

TIME TO CHECK MY BLOOD PRESSURE

PS IF YOU ARE A TROLL YOU ARE LITERALLY THE BEST TROLL EVER I APPLAUD YOU
YOU JEST OF COURSE

BUT JUST IN CASE NO SENSIBLE WOMAN OR JEW WOULD BE OFFENDED BY THE CANTERBURY TALES
I'D PRESS TO TRY TO DISCUSS THE MORE IMPORTANT ASPECTS UNIVERSITY COURSES ARE NOTORIOUS FOR BEING FULL OF MISOGYNY AND ANTI-SEMITISM SO IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO DRIVE HOME THE DISGUSTING PARTS OF SOCIETY

YOU WON'T GET MUCH SUPPORT HERE ON REDDIN THOUGH LOTS OF AND MISOGYNIST USERS
I READ IT A FEW WEEKS AGO I ENJOYED IT IT WAS TOUGH TO READ SINCE BECOMING A PARENT IT HAS BECOME REALLY TOUGH TO READ ABOUT KIDS DYING AT TIMES BUT THE OVERALL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE TACTICS AND PURPOSE OF TERROR WAS PRETTY PROVOCATIVE
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS OF THE YEAR HERE'S AN INTERVIEW I DID WITH THE AUTHOR HERE
FIRST READ READ A BIT I STOPPED IT WHEN THE MARRIAGE STARTED DISINTEGRATING DON'T REMEMBER MORE

SECOND
THE TAKING BLAME FOR THE REAL BOMBER WAS UNNECESSARILY DRAMATIC DON'T REMEMBER MORE


WRITING IS GOOD ENOUGH BUT NOTHING MEMORABLE

WHAT QUOTES DO YOU MAKE OF IT




DONATE THEM TO A PRISON A SHELTER A LIBRARY SECOND HAND BOOKSHOP
RECOGNIZE THAT AS A COLLECTOR SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE CHOOSY WITH WHAT YOU FIND AND WHAT YOU KEEP I KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY OF TIMES WHERE I CONTEMPLATED GETTING A HAUL OR JUST A LARGE STACK FOR CHEAP BUT HAD TO LEAVE IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE SPACE OR INTEREST

YOU SHOULD GO THROUGH AND SEE WHAT BOOKS INTEREST YOU THE MOST TRY TO PARE IT DOWN TO THE BOOKS YOU MOST WANT TO READ THEN START ADVERTISING BULK LOTS IN YOUR LOCAL CRAIGSLIST OR EBAY

IF I LIVED IN LONDON I'D CERTAINLY TAKE SOME OF THOSE OFF YOUR HANDS ALAS I AM IN CANADA AND CAN'T DO MUCH
SELL THEM ON AMAZON OR EBAY

IN THE US WE HAVE SECOND HAND STORES THAT WILL BUY MOST BOOKS ESPECIALLY IN GREAT CONDITION FOR CASH OR STORE CREDIT

DONATE TO YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER CONTACTING A LOCAL SCHOOL AS A TEACHER I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR GOOD BOOKS FOR MY CLASSROOM LIBRARY
I LIVE IN THE UK AND I'LL HAPPILY TAKE SOME OFF YOUR HANDS ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIVE IN LONDON SELLING IN JOBLOTS ON EBAY IS PROBABLY YOUR BEST BET BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OF THE BOOKS SELLING QUICKLY IF AT ALL
SELL THEM I'D BUY SOME
YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK INTO IF THERE ARE ANY LITTLE FREE LIBRARIES NEAR YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD ONE LIBRARY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HOLD VERY MANY BUT I'M SURE THE STEWARDS WOULD APPRECIATE HAVING A BOX OR TWO TO FILL THE LIBRARY WHEN IF IT RUNS LOW

YOU COULD OF COURSE LOOK INTO STARTING YOUR OWN LIBRARY IT'S A GREAT WAY TO GET BOOKS OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY
MAYBE YOU COULD DO A BOOK SALE OR GIVEAWAY OR SOMETHING ON HERE I'M SURE A LOT OF US WOULD BE HAPPY TO BUY SOME

BUT IF THAT'S NOT AN OPTION DONATION TO MAYBE A SCHOOL OR SHELTER NEAR YOU WOULD BE A GREAT THING
OPEN AN ONLINE BOOKSTORE YOU HAVE THE INVENTORY THIS IS WHAT I PLAN TO DO I HAVE HUNDREDS OF BOOKS TO GET RID OF AND LISTING THEM ON AMAZON OR EBAY DOES NOT WORK I NEED AN ONLINE BOOKSTORE WHERE I CAN OFFER BOOKS FOR AS LONG AS I LIKE UNTIL THEY SELL
FIRST OFF GET A SHURGAURD STORAGE BOX GIVES YOU AT LEAST A MONTH FOR A POUND TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THEM
I LIVE IN OXFORD SO WOULD BE WILLING TO BUY A FEW FROM YOU IF YOU PUT THEM ON EBAY OR SOMEWHERE ELSE
START READING
YOU COULD PROBABLY SELL THE FOLIO SOCIETY BOOKS EASILY EN MASSE I'D LIKELY BUY SOME
FOLIO SOCIETY EDITIONS HOLY SHIT THAT'S SOME SERIOUS MONEY
I WONDER IF YOU COULD HAVE A BIG BOOK SALE OR GIVEAWAY AT SOME PLACE OTHER THAN YOUR HOUSE MAYBE A PARK OR SOMETHING AND MAKE A KIND OF PARTY OUT OF IT AND A CELEBRATION OF THIS LADY'S LIFE PARTICULARLY NICE IF SHE WERE STILL ALIVE AND COGENT ENOUGH TO AT LEAST LEARN OF THIS EVENT BEFORE SHE PASSED AWAY IF YOU GOT PEOPLE TO EACH TAKE BOOKS WOULD CUT IT IN HALF THE REST YOU COULD DONATE
I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN BUYING SOME ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIVE IN THE LONDON AREA IF YOU EVER THINK ABOUT POSTING THEM TO EBAY LET ME KNOW FIRST
AS OTHERS ARE SAYING YOU SHOULD SELL SOME MORE VALUABLE ONES AND DONATE SOME TO SCHOOLS LIBRARIES ETC I KNOW THAT SOME FIRE STATIONS AND POLICE STATIONS ACCEPT BOOKS AND DISTRIBUTE THEM TO THE COMMUNITY
SELL THEM FOR ONE DOLLAR
KEEP OR SELL THE FOLIO SOCIETY BOOKS AND HANG ON TO TITLES YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN TALK TO HIGH SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES ABOUT DONATIONS I'D AVOID SENDING THEM TO CHARITY OR THRIFT STORES IF YOU JUST WANT TO GET THEM OUT TAKE THEM TO A COUPLE USED BOOK STORES AND USE THE CREDIT
AS AN EXAMPLE OF A PLACE THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED THE PEOPLE WHO SELL BOOKS UNDER THE BRIDGE AT SOUTHBANK I IMAGINE SECOND HAND SELLERS LIKE THAT MIGHT TAKE THEM OFF YOUR HANDS AND YOU MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME MONEY
OP ARE THERE ANY BOOKS BY B S JOHNSON IN THERE WOULD DEFINITELY BUY ASSUMING IT'S NOT ONE I HAVE ALREADY
I DONATE TO A NEARBY PRISON
GET A SHEET OF GLASS STICK BOOKS TOGETHER MAKE FOUR LEGS OF EQUAL HEIGHT PUT GLASS ON TOP PRESTO FANCY COFFEE TABLE
YOU CAN CUT THEM ALL ONE LENGTH AND GLUE THEM TO YOUR WALL AND THEN TRANSITION TO THE CEILING I SAW A POST HERE AWHILE BACK THAT SOMEONE DID THAT

WELL HERE WE GO AGAIN
FANTASTIC BEASTS IS WONDERFUL AND I WILL READ AND SEE ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAS TO DO WITH HP AND I HOPE SHE WRITES A NEW ONE EVERY 2 YEARS
ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE THINGS ABOUT ULYSSES IS SEEING HOW HIS STYLE AND WORK INFLUENCED OTHER AUTHORS THIS MAY BE A BIT PRETENTIOUS BUT IT'S NOT A BOOK BEST ENJOYED IN ISOLATION IT WORKS MUCH BETTER WHEN YOU READ IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A LARGER LITERARY MOVEMENT TRY READING SOME FAULKNER SOME VIRGINIA WOOLF TO THE LIGHTHOUSE IS GREAT FOR THIS AND PROBABLY SOME GADDIS THE RECOGNITIONS IS DIFFICULT BUT IT'S A GOOD TEST TO SEE IF YOU ENJOY STRUGGLING THROUGH A BOOK AND THEN GO BACK TO ULYSSES AND ENJOY PICKING UP ON THE LITTLE BITS AND PIECES AND STYLES THAT OTHER GREATS HAVE LIFTED OR BORROWED
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THIS ADVICE BEFORE AS HIS GUIDE IS A STANDARD RECOMMENDATION FOR ULYSSES NEWCOMERS BUT YOUR POST DOESN'T MENTION IT SO IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T IT'S WORTHWHILE TO CONSULT HARRY THE NEW BLOOMSDALE BOOK WHICH IS KIND OF A MORE EXTENSIVE SPARKNOTES IT SHOULD BE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN LIBRARIES AND ONLINE BOOKSHOPS I'VE JUST SEARCHED ABEBOOKS AND THERE ARE COPIES SELLING FOR LESS THAN TEN DOLLARS IN CLEAR ACCESSIBLE LANGUAGE BLAMIRES GUIDES YOU THROUGH EACH EPISODE POINTING OUT HOMERIC AND OTHER LITERARY CULTURAL ALLUSIONS THEMES SYMBOLS AND MOTIFS JOKES THE SUBJECTS OF NUMEROUS PARODIES ETC ALL EXPLAINED WITH AN OBJECTIVITY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO COME TO YOUR OWN INTERPRETATIONS OF THE TEXT IT'S LESS DRYLY DIDACTIC THAN THAT LAST SENTENCE MAKES IT SOUND ONE REVIEWER ON GOODREADS SAYS THAT THIS BOOK IS LIKE FOLLOWING AN EXPERIENCED GUIDE ON A RELATIVELY BRIEF TOUR THROUGH A FOREIGN CITY THERE ARE OTHER SUMMARIES AND MORE DETAILED ANNOTATIONS BUT BLAMIRES IS RIGHTLY HAILED AS THE MOST ENGAGING GIDE FOR THE GENERAL READER IF YOU STILL CAN'T GET THROUGH IT THERE IS NEEDLESS TO SAY NO SHAME IN PUTTING IT DOWN AND TRYING AGAIN LATER YOU MIGHT JUST NOT BE IN THE RIGHT MOOD

EDITED TO ADD IF YOU'D LIKE TO READ A BIT OF THE BLAMIRES BEFORE YOU GET IT I FOUND A FREE SAMPLE OF THE INTRODUCTION AND FIRST TWO CHAPTERS ON GOOGLE PLAY I TRIED TO POST THE DIRECT LINK BUT MY COMMENT WAS REMOVED BY THE AUTOCOID SKIP TO PAGE FIFTEEN FOR THE INTRODUCTION

SECOND EDIT IT MIGHT ALSO HELP TO READ THE NOVEL OUT LOUD OR LISTEN TO AN AUDIOBOOK JOYCE IS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSELY MUSICAL STYLISTS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND THE BEAUTY AND HUMOUR OF HIS PROSE IS OFTEN DERIVED FROM THE SOUNDS THE HARMONIES AND RHYTHMS OF WORDS WHICH CAN BE HARD TO PICK UP WHEN YOU'RE SILENTLY READING THIS IS DOUBLY TRUE OF FINNEGAN WAKE IF YOU EVER WANT TO GIVE THAT A TRY
I THINK THE BEST ADVICE FOR READING ULYSSES IF YOU'RE NOT DOING SO FOR SCHOLARLY OR ACADEMIC PURPOSES IS TO GO INTO IT ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT YOU PROBABLY WON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND A LOT OF IT JUST READ WHAT'S THERE REAP FROM IT WHAT YOU CAN AND CONSULT SECONDARY SOURCES FOR HELP IF YOU WANT I RECOMMEND IT SPARKNOTES IS DECENT AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS THREAD HAVE MENTIONED OTHERS IT'S A FUN READ IF YOU DON'T TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY AND YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO WORK TOO HARD TO GET SOMETHING WORTHWHILE OUT OF IT
THIS HAS HELPED ME A LOT AND HOPEFULLY IT MAY HELP YOU AT THE END OF EACH CHAPTER TRY TO WRITE A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAIN CHARACTER WHAT EFFECTED THE STORYLINE OR HIS HER GOAL OR QUEST IF THERE ARE WORDS YOU DON'T KNOW LOOK THEM UP IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THE SENTENCE IF IT'S YOUR BOOK GO AHEAD AND WRITE IT IN THE MARGIN I ALWAYS FIND THAT FUN BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE A LITTLE REBEL WRITING ON BOOKS POST IT NOTES CAN BE HELPFUL AND REREADING CHAPTERS OR PARAGRAPHS IS FINE TOO MAKE SURE YOU'RE READING IN A QUIET PLACE WHERE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE SO YOU CAN CONCENTRATE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE READING ANYTHING YOU NEED TO DO TO UNDERSTAND IS OKAY HOPEFULLY THIS HELPED GOOD LUCK
I GAVE UP TWICE BOTH TIMES AROUND ONE-THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH MUCH LATER I TRIED AGAIN USING AN AUDIOBOOK TO HELP ME I GOT TO THE END AND I'M REALLY GLAD I PERSISTED WITH IT I WILL READ IT AGAIN ONE DAY
HAVE A LISTEN TO NOVELIST BBC HOST FRANK PODCAST RE JOYCE HE'S GOING THROUGH THE BOOK ALMOST LITERALLY ONE LINE AT A TIME



THE MAN IS A DELIGHT TO LISTEN TO BUT I'D BE SURPRISED IF HE ACTUALLY MAKES IT TO THE END OF THE NOVEL
WHAT'S DIFFICULT ABOUT ULYSSES IS THE GAP BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AN AMERICAN THE GAP IN MY KNOWLEDGE OF IRISH HISTORY AND CULTURE ALONGSIDE THAT JOYCE WAS OFTEN QUOTED AS SAYING THAT THE BOOK COULD SERVE AS A BLUEPRINT OF THE CITY OF DUBLIN IF IT EVER WERE DESTROYED BETWEEN THAT AND ALL OF THE OUT-OF-DATE LINGO AND CULTURAL REFERENCES IT CAN BE A BIT OVERWHELMING I TOOK A CLASS ON THE BOOK IN COLLEGE BUT I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT ONE COULD TRAVERSE THE BOOK WITHOUT SOME ACADEMIC GUIDANCE BUT THERE IS A PRETTY HELPFUL BOOK THAT WAS EXTREMELY USEFUL TO ME WHEN I WENT THROUGH IT THIS ANNOTATED GUIDE IS PRETTY LARGE BUT WAS GREAT FOR SOME OF THE LATER MORE DISORIENTING CHAPTERS WHERE JOYCE IS JUST FLINGING OUT REFERENCES LEFT AND RIGHT FROM WHERE YOU ARE NOW I THINK THE MOST DIFFICULT CHAPTER AHEAD OF YOU IS OXEN OF THE SUN WHICH IS A NIGHTMARE OF THE NINE EVOLUTIONARY STEPS OF MODERN IRISH LANGUAGE AT THE TIME BUT EVERYTHING AFTER SHOULD BE PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD BUT DEFINITELY LOOK INTO THIS BOOK AND DEFINITELY FINISH HONESTLY ONE OF THE MOST REWARDING PIECES OF FICTION I'VE EVER READ HERE'S THE ANNOTATED GUIDE

GODSPEED
I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ULYSSES THAT IS PROBABLY A BIT CONTROVERSIAL BUT IT'S JUST MY OPINION ANY BOOK WHICH REQUIRES A COLLEGE COURSE TO FULLY UNDERSTAND ISN'T VERY GOOD ULYSSES IS AT BEST AN EXERCISE IN PRETENSION AND OVER INDULGENCE AND AT WORST AN ELITIST TEXT ENJOYED SOLELY AS A MEANS OF DISTINGUISHING THE READER FROM OTHERS WHO HAVEN'T HAD THE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION TO AFFORD THEM A MEANS TO ENJOY IT

IF YOU'RE NOT ENJOYING IT JUST TOSS IT AWAY AND READ SOMETHING YOU'LL LIKE
KEEP TRUCKING I FIND THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE NOVEL TO BE THE MOST DENSE AND LEAST ENJOYABLE THE LAST TWO CHAPTERS ARE EASILY MY FAVORITES

NOT SURE ABOUT THE SPARKNOTES BUT BETTER ANNOTATIONS CAN HELP TOO IT CAN BE INVALUABLE TO READ A SUMMARY OF EACH CHAPTER BEFORE OR AFTERWARDS DEPENDING ON YOUR TASTE I'M A TIMER WITH ULYSSES IT IS WORTH IT
THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR IN THE PAST CHECK OUT FAQ ITEMS 2 AND FOR MORE INFORMATION
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT METHOD AS YOU HAVE NOTICED WE BOTH SHARE A COMMON PROBLEM MINE IS EVEN COMPLICATED SINCE I'M NOT A NATIVE SPEAKER BUT AGAIN THIS SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM SINCE I READ AND UNDERSTAND THE ONLY PROBLEM IS WHEN I TRY TO CONVERT MY UNDERSTANDING INTO WORDS I GET STUCK
I ACTUALLY DO THE EXACT SAME THING AS YOU I PUT POST IT NOTES ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE BOOK TO MEAN DIFFERENT KINDS OF NOTES I ALSO FIND MYSELF WRITING A LOT OF DEFINITIONS IN THE MARGINS OF MY BOOKS IT'S A GOOD SYSTEM KEEP READING
THIS IS A PRETTY CLEVER SYSTEM I LOVE CATEGORIZATIONS LIKE THIS SO I MIGHT USE THIS SYSTEM AT SOME POINT
I REVIEW ALL THE BOOKS I READ SO I OFTEN GO BACK TO MY BLOG AND REREAD MY OWN REVIEW TO GET A GENERAL SENSE OF WHAT I FELT ABOUT THE BOOK IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC QUOTES I UPDATE MY READING AS I GO ON GOODREADS ESPECIALLY WITH LINES THAT I FOUND PARTICULARLY GOOD OUTRAGEOUS TERRIBLE IF I WANT TO REMEMBER A PARTICULAR QUOTE I CAN JUST REFER BACK TO MY GOODREADS UPDATES
WHEN I USED TO READ PHYSICAL BOOKS I LOVED TO USE 3M S FLAGS THE COME IN MULTIPLE COLORS AND ONE HALF IS TRANSPARENT THIS WAY YOU NEVER COVER ANY TEXT

THIS IS HOW I DID IT

CHOOSE FLAG ACCORDING TO COLOR CODE
APPLY THE FLAG WHERE THE PARAGRAPH SENTENCE BEGINS
WRITE A REFERENCE NUMBER ON THE FLAG
WRITE DOWN THE NUMBER MY COMMENTS ON AN EMPTY BOOK PAGE


USING THIS METHOD I CAN LOOK FOR ALL MY COMMENTS ON A SINGLE PAGE AND JUMP TO THE REFERENCED FLAG
IF I LIKED THE BOOK OR PARTS OF IT STUCK OUT TO ME I REMEMBER EVEN NEARLY YEARS LATER

IF I DIDN'T LIKE IT OR IT WAS BORING I MIGHT FORGET THAT I'VE EVEN READ IT AS LITTLE AS A YEAR OR A FEW MONTHS AFTER READING

BUT I ALSO READ THE ENTIRE DUNE SERIES IN MAYBE MONTHS I HAD TO WORK AND LIVE TOO
SOMETIMES WHEN READING BOOKS ON MY PHONE I'LL TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF THE PARTS THAT STICK OUT I RECENTLY READ LESLIE BECOMING GRANDMA AND WOULD TEXT PARTS OF MY HUSBAND PREFACED WITH CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS SHIT
SAME PROBLEM HERE

BUT ACTUALLY I ENJOY IT MEANS I CAN A BOOK AND STILL HAVE PLEASURE DOING IT BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH
THIS TITLE IS THE TYPE OF THING I'D EXPECT TO GET POSTED IN R BOOKSCIRCLEJERK
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED A KINDLE GOT ONE A FEW MONTHS AGO HAVE NOT WANTED TO GO BACK

NOTES ARE SO MUCH EASIER TO TAKE AND EXPORT

THERE'S REALLY NO REASON TO THROW IT IN YOUR BAG WHEN YOU GO SOMEWHERE IT'S SMALL AND HOLDS THOUSANDS OF BOOKS

AND YOU CAN LOOK UP WORDS VIA DICTIONARY WIKIPEDIA GOOGLE TRANSLATE BY SIMPLY HIGHLIGHTING THE WORD WHILE YOU'RE READING

THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH A KINDLE HAS BEEN THAT THERE ARE STILL BOOKS WHERE PHYSICAL COPY IS SUPERIOR BOOKS WITH LOTS OF GRAPHICS OR PHOTOS IN PARTICULAR SUCH AS PHOTOGRAPHY DESIGN OR PROGRAMMING BOOKS IS THE ISSUES I'VE RAN INTO I JUST BUY THE PHYSICAL COPY THEN

AUDIOBOOKS ARE ALSO GREAT JUST HARD TO TAKE NOTES ON THEM CAR RIDES DOING DISHES ETC THOUGH THEY'RE PERFECT

I HAD A SYSTEM FOR TAKING NOTES WITH MY PHYSICAL BOOKS BUT IT WAS GETTING SO TIME CONSUMING AND THIS HAS BEEN A CONVENIENT SOLUTION
I READ THE BOOKS FIRST COULDN'T FINISH THE BOOKS DID FINISH THE MOVIES
SO I ONLY SAW THE FIRST MOVIE NOT THE 2ND OR 3RD OTHER THAN THE BRIEF CLIPS IN TRAILERS AND SUCH

I STARTED READING THE BOOKS AND I'M MORE LENIENT TOWARDS THE MOVIES I'M NOT SURE IF ITS JUST WRITING BUT THE READING SEEMS LITE I FELT THE THERE WAS MORE IS THAT A WORD IN THE MOVIES

OH WELL IMAGINATION IS A CURIOUS THING
I SAW THE FIRST MOVIE WHEN I WAS HOME SICK ONE DAY AND DECIDED TO READ THE BOOKS AT THE TIME NONE OF THE OTHER MOVIES HAD BEEN RELEASED BUT I DID LIKE THE FIRST BOOK MORE THAN THE MOVIE I THINK THE THIRD BOOK IS CONTENTIOUS A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE UPSET WITH HOW IT ENDED PRETTY TYPICAL FOR SERIES ANYWAY IMO BUT THE MOVIES JUST WENT DOWNHILL FROM THE FIRST ONE HAHA I AM GENERALLY VERY LENIENT WITH MOVIE ADAPTATIONS IF I LIKED THE BOOK I USUALLY LIKE THE MOVIES TOO SO MAYBE I'M NOT THE BEST JUDGE
I SAW THE FIRST MOVIE AND THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY SO I PICKED UP THE FIRST BOOK BUT I DIDN'T LIKE IT AND STOPPED READING AFTER A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS I HAVEN'T SEEN THE OTHER MOVIES IN THE SERIES

I DON'T THINK I'M THE TARGET AUDIENCE THOUGH BEING IN MY AND WHILE I'VE READ AND ENJOYED QUITE A LOT OF YA BOOKS SOMETHING ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER REALLY ANNOYED ME DIDN'T BOTHER ME IN A 2 HOUR MOVIE BUT NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO SPEND HOURS READING
I READ THE FIRST 2 BOOK AND THOUGHT THEY HAD A LOT OF PROMISE BUT GOT BOGGED DOWN TOO MUCH IN THE TEENAGE DRAMA ASPECT

I WATCHED THE FIRST FILM ONLY AS I COULDN'T STAND IT

I'D SAY THEY'RE LIKE A MORE TEENAGE DRAMA VERSION OF THE HUNGER GAMES SERIES TSH
FUCK NO DIDNT EVEN SEE ALL THE MOVIES THINK I GOT TRICKED INTO SEEING ONE OF THEM
I DISAGREE RATHER VEHEMENTLY WITH THIS ARTICLE PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO THINK THAT WRITERS AUTOMATICALLY CONDONE WHAT THEY WRITE INTO THEIR STORIES AND CHARACTERS NOT SO YES WINSTON FROM WAS A FLAWED CHARACTER HE WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY AS WAS ALEX FROM A CLOCKWORK ORANGE BERNARD MARX IN BRAVE NEW WORLD ENDER FROM GAME WILL DAVIDSON IN HOUSE OF LEAVES ADAM IN EAST OF EDEN AND SO ON THEY ARE DEVICES USED TO RELATE A STORY OR IDEA AND OFTEN NOT AN IDEAL SET FORWARD AS AN EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW
SO WE SHOULD IGNORE GREAT LITERARY WORKS JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY SLIGHT HINTS OF SEXISM
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE READ CITER BUT DOESN'T HE TALK ABOUT GIRLS BEING DUMB IN ONE OF HIS PHONY RANTS LIKE THAT'S WHAT GUYS LIKE AND GIRLS LIKE GUYS SO GIRLS PLAY DUMB AND HELPLESS ALSO ISN'T THE INNOCENCE AND VIRTUE REFLECTED ON HIS SISTER RIDING THE MERRY-GO-ROUND BECAUSE SHE'S LIKE FUCKING TEN OR SOMETHING

ALSO THEIR ARGUMENT FOR IS COMICAL THAT IT'S ACTUALLY JUST I DIDN'T LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER
FROM THE ARTICLE

SALINGER STILL DOESN'T PROVIDE US WITH ANY OUT FEMALE CHARACTERS TO GIVE THEIR OWN OPINIONS

ORWELL MIGHT BE A GREAT WRITER WHEN IT COMES TO SOCIAL COMMENTARY BUT JULIA IS A PRETTY FLIMSY CHARACTER

WOMEN AS A GROUP FARE EVEN WORSE IN MARGARET FUTURE DYSTOPIA BUT THE FEMALE CHARACTERS ARE FAR BETTER WRITTEN

I'D LIKE TO HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION REGARDING THESE PARTS AS I AM A BIT CONFUSED

IS A FAILURE TO INCLUDE WELL-WRITTEN FEMALE CHARACTERS IN A NOVEL INHERENTLY SEXIST

I MUST ADMIT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION TWO THINGS THAT CAME TO MY MIND

WHO DECIDES WHETHER A FEMALE CHARACTER IS WELL-WRITTEN ISN'T ANY JUDGEMENT CONCERNING THIS SUBJECTIVE IN MOST CASES

NOW I'M A CAUCASIAN MALE IN MY MID AS SUCH I WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A WOMAN LET'S SAY I WRITE A NOVEL WOULD IT BE INHERENTLY SEXIST SINCE I CAN ONLY WRITE ABOUT THE WORLD FROM THE POINT OF VIEW I WAS BORN IN

EXPANDING ON POINT 2 LET'S SAY I'D BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH INCLUDING A FEMALE CHARACTER IN MY NOVEL PRECISELY BECAUSE I CAN NEVER HOPE TO ACCURATELY PORTRAY A FEMALE CHARACTER UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD THE BOOK BE SEXIST

ANYONE WILLING TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS

JUST TO CLARIFY OF COURSE I'M NOT AGAINST INCLUDING FEMALE CHARACTERS IN NOVELS
THIS ARTICLE IS WAY TOO SENSITIVE I GET WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY BUT TO JUST IGNORE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS OF ALL TIME BECAUSE OF A HINT OF SEXISM IS DUMB IN MY OPINION
WHAT KIND OF HIGH SCHOOL ASSIGNS LOLITA
CLICK BAIT FOR ANGRY ACADEMICS

DOWNVOTE TO HELLLLLLLLLL
THIS IS JUST STUPID AND REALLY UNNECESSARY
FIRST THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT THE TIMES THAT THEY WERE WRITTEN THE HURTS MY FEELINGS BOOKS RANGE FROM LIKE TO WHILE WITH THE EXCLUSION OF ORLANDO WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN THE WALKING ON EGGSHELLS BOOKS ARE FROM TO NO SHIT THE OLD ONES MAY OR MAY NOT BE A LITTLE SEXIST

SECOND A BOOK LIKE CATCHER IN THE RYE WAS MEANT TO TELL A STORY OR PAINT A PICTURE WHATEVER IF YOU LOOK AT A PAINTING OF A HAMBURGER AND YOU GET MAD YOU DON'T SEE A HOTDOG IT'S NOT THE PAINTERS FAULT
MORE RIGHT THINK NONSENSE ATTEMPTING TO MAAR SURE EVERYONE THINKS THE SAME AND SUPPRESSES ANYTHING NOT IN LINE WITH SUCH THOUGHTS

HOW QUAINT ANOTHER NOBODY TELLING EVERYONE ELSE WHAT IS RIGHT AND SHOULD BE DONE
WHY NOT HAVE THEM READ ALL
CATCHER IN THE RYE BELL JAR SHOULDN'T READ EITHER OF THEM IN CLASSICAL THEY'RE BOTH EASY ENOUGH TO READ ON YOUR OWN

LOLITA READING LOLITA IN TEHRAN DITTO

THE TALE TRIKETO

THE SUN ALSO RISES ORLANDO BY VIRGINIA WOOLF READ BOTH

THE SCARLET LETTER THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS ONLY READ THE SCARLET LETTER I HATED IT BUT IT'S A CLASSIC AND THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS ISN'T
I DON'T KNOW HOW I ESCAPED IT BUT I HAVEN'T READ ANY BUT A COUPLE OF THOSE AND I READ ON MY OWN NOT AS AN ASSIGNMENT
SOME OF US READ ALL OF THEM IN HIGH SCHOOL MARGARET ATWOOD NOT SO MUCH
I THINK THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE DOES HERSELF A DISSERVICE BY CREATING A LIST OF BOOKS RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THE BOOKS AS A COLLECTION IMO THE PROBLEM SHE IDENTIFIES A LACK OF GOOD FEMALE CHARACTERS IS MUCH EASIER TO SEE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A CURRICULUM THAT IS ONLY FILLED WITH BOOKS THAT FEATURE MALE PROTAGONISTS WHETHER THIS PROBLEM ACTUALLY EXISTS IN REALITY IS HARD TO SAY WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL WE DID IN FACT READ BOOKS THAT STAR FEMALE LEADS THE TALE STATE OF WONDER GHOST BUT I CAN DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT SOMEWHERE OUT THERE ENGLISH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE ONLY READING NOVELS WITH MALE PROTAGONISTS

I THINK THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM ISN'T THAT FEMALE SIDE CHARACTERS ARE TYPICALLY ONE-DIMENSIONAL BUT THAT SIDE CHARACTERS THEMSELVES ARE TYPICALLY ONE-DIMENSIONAL AND EXIST ONLY TO SERVE SOME PURPOSE TO THE MAIN CHARACTER WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE BOOKS LIKE CATCHER IN THE RYE AND THE SUN ALSO RISES ARE STILL GOOD BOOKS TO READ WHEN LOOKED AT INDIVIDUALLY WHICH IS WHAT I THINK A LOT OF COMMENTATORS ARE CURRENTLY DOING
THIS AUTHOR IS FULL OF SHIT THE THING IS MOST OF THE AUTHOR'S SELECTED NOVELS SEEM TO INCLUDE SEXISM WOMEN'S TREATMENT AS ONE OF THE DEFINING THEMES OF THE BOOK NOTED I HAVEN'T READ THEM SPARK NOTES THAT'S NOT WHAT THE ORIGINALS WERE ABOUT THEY MAY HAVE HAD SEXISM BUT THAT WAS NOT A CENTRAL THEME OF THESE BOOKS NOT EVERY BOOK NEEDS TO HAVE A STANCE ON SEXISM TO BE WORTH READING OR STUDYING AS THERE IS MORE TO HUMAN LIFE THAN THAT AND THIS AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT LIKE SERIOUSLY HOW IS LOLITA ANYTHING LIKE READING LOLITA IN TERAH

ALSO NOTED NOTHING AGAINST HER CHOSEN BOOKS THEY DO THEIR OWN THING AND PROBABLY WELL THEY'RE JUST NOT SUBSTITUTES AS PER HER DESCRIPTION IF SHE WANTS TO ADVOCATE TEACHING ABOUT SEXISM ARBITRARILY COMPARING TO BOOKS OBVIOUSLY NOT ABOUT SEXISM IS IDIOTIC AND DOES NOTHING TO HELP HERALDRY
I WON'T COMMENT ON THE REST OF THE LIST BUT THIS PART ON LOLITA

OY DO I EVEN HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS ONE I UNDERSTAND THAT NABOKOV HIMSELF HOPEFULLY DOESN'T CONDONE HUMBERT ACTIONS AND IT'S POSSIBLE TO FIND A FEMINIST READING IN THE NOVEL IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS THE PORTRAIT OF A PREDATOR BUT STILL THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF ROMANTICIZING PEDOPHILIA GOING ON HERE NO THANKS

WHAT FIRST OFF I DOUBT THERE'S ANY HIGH SCHOOL THAT HAS MADE LOLITA REQUIRED READING BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ROMANTICIZING PEDOPHILIA THE ONLY WAY SOMEONE COULD BELIEVE THAT IS IF THEY'VE NEVER ACTUALLY READ THE BOOK AND ARE RELYING ON POP CULTURE KNOWLEDGE OF IT OR IF THEY'RE A PEDOPHILE THE NOVEL NEVER SHIES AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT HUMBERT HUMBERT IS A MONSTER AND THAT THERE'S NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH LOLITA
WHO CARES IF THE AUTHOR WAS SEXIST A GOOD BOOK IS A GOOD BOOK

I'M SURE NEARLY ALL THE EUROPEAN RENAISSANCE ARTISTS WERE SEXIST AND RACIST AS NEARLY EVERYONE WAS AT THE TIME DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN'T ENJOY THEIR ART


I JUST READ THE ARTICLE IT MADE ME THROW UP A LITTLE IN THE BACK OF MY MOUTH
SOME PRETTY GOOD CHOICES ACTUALLY ESPECIALLY FOR HIGH SCHOOL MOST ADULTS SEEM TO MISS THE POINT OF LOLITA WHICH YOU UNDERSTAND IMMEDIATELY FROM PRETTY MUCH EVERY SINGLE COVER OF THE BOOK SO I DON'T HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE THAT HIGH SCHOOLS ARE EXAMINING ALL THE THINGS THEY NEED TO IN THE BOOK

THERE'S SO MUCH DUELIST IN SCHOOL AND MEN GET VERY UPSET WHEN YOU SUGGEST THAT WHITE MALE EXPERIENCES ARE NOT ACTUALLY UNIVERSAL WHAT DO YOU MEAN PERPETRATING VIOLENT RAPE ISN'T UNIVERSAL
WHY DID YOU READ THREE OF THEM
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES AND PREFERENCES AND THAT'S PERFECTLY OKAY
I FEEL LIKE LATELY ESPECIALLY WITH YA BOOKS IVE BEEN READING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
ITS THE SAME DYSTOPIAN NOVEL THE SAME FANTASY STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IVE TRIED TO EXPAND QUITE A BIT AND IVE SUCCEEDED BUTS ITS NOT EASY I FEEL LIKE THE REASON WHY MAAS IS SO POPULAR IS BECAUSE SHE WRITES WHAT A LOT OF YA READERS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH WHICH IS PERFECTLY FINE BUT HER WRITING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE GREAT OR ANYTHING BECAUSE ITS JUST THE SAME YA STORY RETOLD WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERS AND A BIT OF A DIFFERENT LOCATION
AGAIN NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AND MAYBE I HAVE JUST BECOME TIRED OF YA BUT IVE FOUND THAT TO BE THE CASE WITH A LOT OF BESTSELLERS IN THE YA COMMUNITY BUT HEY THAT'S MY 2 CENTS
WHEN I READ THRONE OF GLASS IT WAS SOMETHING REFRESHING YA IS TYPICALLY THE GENRE I READ MOST AND I WAS TIRED OF ALL THE REPETITIVE STORIES AND CENSORED CRAP I WANTED SOMETHING A BIT MORE MATURE BUT STILL HAD THAT YA FUN

MAAS PRETTY MUCH GAVE ME THAT I ENJOY HER CHARACTERS SOME REALLY FANTASTIC ONES THAT COME IN LATER BOOKS ARE MY FAVORITES

SHE'S ALSO JUST A GOOD PERSON I MET HER AT A BOOK SIGNING AND SHE HAD ME IN TEARS FROM LAUGHING SO MUCH SHE'S FUCKING HILARIOUS

PLUS SHE HAD WRITTEN THRONE OF GLASS WHEN SHE WAS AND THAT BLEW MY MIND I WAS LIKE DAMN IF SHE CAN BECOME A BESTSELLER SO CAN
IT'S A SIMILAR REASON TO WHY PEOPLE LIKE TWILIGHT

IT HONES IN ON THE SQUAD DEVELOPS A CULT FOLLOWING WHICH THEN BECOMES AN INDIE HIT THAT PROCEEDS TO BE HIPSTER MAINSTREAM AND THEN ALL HAIL THE BANDWAGONING

THAT BEING SAID I HAVEN'T READ THRONE OF GLASS THOUGH I PROBABLY WILL WHEN THE SERIES ACTUALLY ENDS I READ COURT OF THORNS ROSES AS PART OF A BOOK CLUB AND IT WAS MPH

GUESS I'VE JUST REACHED THE AGE WHERE YA REALLY DOESN'T APPEAL TO ME AS MUCH
U SOUTH A PERSON HERE IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT TABLE ON PAGE I THINK THEY'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT NORMAL BOOKS FOR FULL-GROWN ADULTS THAT DON'T FALL INTO ANY OF THE OTHER CATEGORIES SUCH AS PROFESSIONAL BOOKS OR RELIGIOUS BOOKS OR EDUCATION TEXTBOOKS SO A NORMAL BESTSELLING NOVEL OR NONFICTION BOOK WOULD FALL IN THEIR ADULT BOOKS CATEGORY

I DON'T THINK THE TERM ENTERTAINMENT LITERATURE HAS ANY CONNECTION OR CONNOTATION WITH EROTICA BUT I COULD BE WRONG
I WOULD ASSUME ADULT BOOKS MEANS PORN
FOR ME IT TOOK ABOUT OF IT TO GET THE HUMOR AND THEN I JUST DIED OF LAUGHTER FROM THEN ON ONE OF THE FEW BOOKS I WILL
YOU SORT OF HAVE TO READJUST YOUR FOCUS WHILE READING THE BOOK IN ADDITION TO PLAYING HOPSCOTCH WITH THE ORDER OF EVENTS THE HUMOR IS OFTEN RATHER HIDDEN YOU FIND SENTENCES VEERING OFF IN UNEXPECTED DIRECTIONS HUMOR THROUGH PROGRESSIVELY WARPED REITERATION AND PUNCHINESS FAR REMOVED FROM THE SETUPS

HUMOR IS OF COURSE SUBJECTIVE SO IT MIGHT SIMPLY BE THAT THIS ISN'T YOUR THING IF YOU'RE GONNA STICK WITH IT I SUGGEST PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION HELLER DOESN'T ANNOUNCE HIS JOKES WITH A DRUM ROLL

IF YOU DO COME TO ENJOY IT I HIGHLY SUGGEST IT YOU ARE BOUND TO FIND THINGS YOU MISSED THE LAST TIME
DON'T TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW EACH CHAPTER AND EACH CHARACTER FIT INTO ANY SORT OF LARGER NARRATIVE JUST READ EACH CHAPTER AS ITS OWN MINI STORY IF YOU COME ACROSS A CHARACTER YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT'S REALLY NOT CRUCIAL TO THE POINT OF THE ENTIRE NOVEL
I THINK WHAT A FEW PEOPLE HAVE SAID REALLY WORK MY ADVICE IS TO NOT VIEW IT AS AN ORDINARY BOOK THE STORY THAT IS ALL JUMBLED UP IS ONE OF THEM TOWARDS THE MIDDLE AND THE END THE STORY SEEMS TO ALL COME TOGETHER IN THE SENSE THAT LIKE YOU START GETTING A SENSE OF A TIMELINE OF HOW THINGS WENT DOWN AT LEAST I DID AS FOR THE HUMOR FOR ME A LARGE THEME OF THIS BOOK IS HIM SATIRIZING THE ABSURDITY OF WAR IN THE FORM OF COMEDY AND QUIRKY EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE BOOK IT MIGHT NOT HELP YOU BUT I THINK IT HELPED ME OUT A LOT WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT I STOPPED READING IT AND READ IT OVER AND AFTER THAT IT BECAME MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK SO I HOPE YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH IT AS I AND MANY OTHERS HAVE

ALSO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE BY KURT VONNEGUT NEXT BOTH SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING BUT ITS FAR MORE IMPACTFUL READING THEM BACK TO BACK AS THEY BOTH TACKLE THE SAME SUBJECT IN BOTH SIMILAR AND DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT WAYS
I READ CATCH LAST YEAR AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT I TOOK IT AS VERY DEADPAN HUMOR AND A FEW OF THE PARTS HAD ME LAUGHING LIKE CRAZY IT IS DEFINITELY DEFINITELY WORTH IT STICK WITH IT
IT'S A STRUGGLE AT THE BEGINNING BUT STICK WITH IT EVERYONE IS MEAN AND WEIRD BUT KEEP GOING JUST FORCE YOURSELF TO GET THROUGH IT IT WILL ALL CLICK TOGETHER IN A MOMENT OF HEARTBREAKING PERFECTION AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY THE BOOK IS A BIG DEAL I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S THAT FUNNY BUT IT IS BRILLIANT OR ELSE YOU'LL HAVE JUST CHECKED AN AMERICAN CLASSIC OFF THE LIST AND YOU NEVER HAVE TO READ IT AGAIN
WELL IN MY MIND IT WAS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A GUY WHO'S BEEN FUCKED UP BY WAR HE FINDS SERIOUSNESS IN A BRITTLE KIND OF WAY THAT'S WHY THE NARRATIVE DOESN'T ROLL CHRONOLOGICALLY PICTURE AN OLD MAN TRYING TO TELL YOU THE TALES OF THE WAR HE'S ALREADY A GOOD SIX BEERS IN AND REMEMBERING THE GOOD PARTS THE STRANGE PARTS AND HIDING THE HORRIBLE PARTS THE REASON IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE MOST OF THE TIME IS ACTUALLY THE MESSAGE CELLAR WAS TRYING TO TELL ABOUT WAR THE MOTIVES DON'T ALWAYS MAKE SENSE AND THINGS THAT SEEM HILARIOUS ARE DEADLY SERIOUS HE AVOIDS TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE SECRET IS UNTIL HE'S FISHING FOR THAT SECOND SIX-PACK BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HE CAN GET THROUGH IT THIS WAS MY FIRST BOOK AND STILL MY FAVORITE FINISH IT YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS FINISH IT A SECOND TIME AND YOU REALLY BEGIN TO HATE THE KIND OF MOTIVATIONS THAT MOVE A NATION TO WAR EACH CHARACTER HAS HIS OWN MOTIVATION AND YOU SEE THAT THE REAL REASON FOR WAR IS ALMOST NEVER WHAT GETS STATED
I NEVER TOOK THE BOOK AS PLOT DRIVEN EXPERIENCE THE FIRST CHAPTERS ARE LIKE THE TOUR OF A MADHOUSE I BELIEVE THE AUTHOR WANTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE ABSURDITY OF WAR

THE FINAL FOURTH OF THE BOOK HAS AN ACTUAL PLOT AND AN A PROPER ENDING STICK WITH IT

MY RECOMMENDATION ENJOY THE LANGUAGE GAMES AND LOGICAL TRICKS MILO IS SPECIALLY FUNNY
IT IS NOT A TODAY STYLE BUT THE CONCEPTS WELL WORTH IT AND MUCH FUNNY IF YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF KEEP GOING THAT SAID IF IT'S ONLY FOR FUN AND YOU ARE NOT HAVING FUN STOP
I JUST READ THIS THIS HELPED ME UNDERSTAND A BIT WHAT WAS GOING ON

WHAT SECTIONS ARE YOU HAVING ISSUES WITH OR FEEL LIKE YOU ARE MISSING WHAT MAKES IT A CLASSIC
IT ALL BENEFITS THE SYNDICATE
THE BEGINNING IS CONFUSING IT'S NOT LINEAR AND THE MAIN THEMES AREN'T EXPLAINED UNTIL THE END KEEP GOING IT'S WORTH IT
KEEP GOING THE HUMOR WILL CLICK AND IT'LL WIN YOU OVER FOSSARIAN IS MY DUDE IF YOU ENJOY IT CHECK OUT A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES BY JOHN KENNEDY TOOLE AFTER IT'S JUST AMAZING
I THINK I NEED TO PICK THIS BOOK UP AGAIN WHEN I AM A LITTLE OLDER NOT THAT I'M VERY YOUNG I WAS WHEN I READ IT BUT I THINK IT CALLS FOR A CERTAIN INHERENT CYNICISM AND WORLD WEARINESS THAT I JUST DIDN'T HAVE WHEN I READ IT I GOT THE POINT I FOUND IT READABLE BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE LOVE FOR IT THAT MANY PROCLAIM TO FEEL
I ACTUALLY STARTED IT MYSELF YESTERDAY

TOOK A WHILE TO REALLY ENJOY IT HAD TO BE IN A SPECIFIC MINDSET IT ACTUALLY HELPED WHEN I SLOWED IT DOWN AND THEN READ IT WITH AN ACCENT IN MY HEAD

THINK OF A FRANCO NARRATING IT
I CANT RECOMMEND THE AUDIOBOOK ON AUDIBLE ENOUGH DOES SO WELL BRINGING THE CHARACTERS TO LIFE AND ALL THE GREAT SATIRE HUMOR NARRATED BY TREVOR WHITE

I WILL DEFINITELY REREAD THE BOOK NEXT YEAR IT WAS AMAZING
I LOVE THIS BOOK JUST GO WITH THE FLOW THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS WHETHER WHAT YOU ARE READING HAS HAPPENED BEFORE OR AFTER ONE PARTICULAR EVENT IN THE NOVEL DON'T GET BOGGED DOWN BY THE EXACT ORDER OF THINGS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT IS BEFORE AND AFTER BY THE WAY THE CHARACTERS ACT
LOVE CATCH AND HAVE READ IT MULTIPLE TIMES IF IT HELPS I GOT A FRIEND WHO WAS FORCE AND I REMEMBER HIM LAUGHING AND SAYING THOSE CIRCULAR POINTLESS CONVERSATIONS WERE EXACTLY HOW YOU TALK WHEN YOU'RE STRESSED AND INCREDIBLY SLEEP DEPRIVED UNTIL HE SAID THAT IT DIDN'T CLICK I JUST ASSUMED THE AUTHOR WAS BEING ABSURD MIGHT HELP YOU CONNECT TO THE STORY A BIT
IT IS A FAIRLY DERIVATIVE STORY
READ A FEW MORE AND YOU MIGHT COME UP WITH SOMETHING REALLY PROFOUND
PEOPLE STILL READ IT'S JUST DIVERSIFIED WITH THE ADVENT OF TABLETS FICTION THAT IS WRITTEN SOLELY FOR ONLINE AUDIENCES AND LONGFORD PROSE

I KNOW THAT MY GROUP OF FRIENDS ALL READ PHYSICAL BOOKS AND THEY'RE HAPPY IF I RECOMMEND A BOOK OR GIVE THEM SOMETHING FROM MY LIBRARY
EH STORIES AND KNOWLEDGE HAVE EVOLVED

I READ ALL THE TIME I CONSTANTLY LEARN I EXPERIENCE STORIES AND ART DAILY I JUST DON'T NEED BOOKS FOR THAT ANYMORE

READING IS IMPORTANT BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE MEDIUM
I DIDN'T NOTICE THIS I WAS IN CLASS YESTERDAY IN THE CORNER OF US HAD READING MATERIALS WITH US JUST THROWN OUT IN FRONT OF US ON THE TABLES AT THE LAB WHERE I AM APPRENTICE I DISCOVERED BOOK LOVERS JUST IN THE ROOM WHERE I SIT WE HAVE LIKE OTHERS ONE VERY ELITE I AM SURE THEY ARE READERS
MY MOTHER GOES TO YOGA WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER LADIES THEY KEEP TRADING THEIR BOOKS BETWEEN EACH OTHER
SO WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM PEOPLE ARE FREE TO CHOOSE AND ENJOY THEIR OWN MEDIUM

IF I WEREN'T AS STUPID AS I WAS I WOULD WATCH MORE TV MOVIES YOUTUBE
THE INTERNET HAS VOIDED THE NEED FOR SO MANY BOOKSHOPS READING IS STILL GOING ON I ENJOY READING A LOT BUT DON'T MEET SO MANY PEOPLE READING WHAT I READ IN ORDER TO HAVE REGULAR BOOK CHATS WITH PEOPLE IT'S MY OPINION YOU'D HAVE TO READ ABOUT MAGIC TIME TRAVEL SPACE OR BOOKS THAT HAVE BECOME FILMS OR TV SHOWS
I LOVE READING BOOKS BUT I MOVE VERY OFTEN IN MY JOB SO CARRYING THEM AROUND EVERY MONTHS ISN'T FEASIBLE I'LL STILL MAKE IT A POINT TO BUY BOOKS MAYBE TIMES A YEAR AND BRING THE ONES I LIKE HOME TO KEEP IN MY PARENTS HOUSE I GET MOST OF MY BOOKS ONLINE THESE DAYS ON A KINDLE APP FROM MY PHONE A RAINY DAY A GOOD BOOK AND A EXCELLENT CUP OF TEA IS STILL MY FAVOURITE WAY TO SPEND THE WEEKEND
I WANT TO I REALLY DO READING JUST FEELS LIKE A CHORE TO ME LIKE SOMETHING I HAVE TO FINISH WHEN I WATCH TV OR MOVIES I CAN JUST RELAX BUT I REALLY DO WANT TO LOVE BOOKS AND READING
YEAH BECAUSE READING BOOKS IS FOR SNOBS NERDS AND OLD PEOPLE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE THINK IN MY TOWN YEAH TIMES CHANGE THAT'S TRUE BUT PEOPLE DON'T EVOLVE THEY ARE GETTING SUCKED BY THE SOCIAL MEDIA THE STUPID ARTICLES THEY READ ON THEM AND DAY AFTER DAY THEY ARE BECOMING DUMBER

WHILE THE INTERNET HAS BROUGHT THE KNOWLEDGE EASIER TO ACCESS PEOPLE TEND TO USE TO IT JUST FOR THE WRONG REASONS
NOBODY I KNOW READS AND EVERY TIME I MENTION A BOOK TO A FRIEND OR RELATIVE I GET A LOT OF AND BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ANYTHING NEW OR NOT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IT ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE EVERY KID I KNEW FELT READING WAS A CHORE
IT'S SAD A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE TIME INVESTMENT IT TAKES WHEN READING GOOD MATERIAL THEY WANT QUICK SHORT AND TO THE POINT OF WHAT THEY ARE LEARNING I DO WISH OTHERS UNDERSTOOD THE VALUE OF READING A FULL BOOK IT TEACHES SO MUCH
TECHNOLOGY HAS PROVIDED US WITH STUFF TO OCCUPY US BUT PEOPLE STILL READ BOOKS LIKE AT MY SCHOOL THERE IS A GROUP OF KIDS WHO READ AN ENTIRE SERIES TOGETHER AND I LIKE TO READ BOOKS TOO
I THINK THIS IS A

PEOPLE STILL LOVE TO READ AND WHOEVER DOESN'T LOVE TO READ NOW WOULD PROBABLY STILL NOT LOVE TO READ IF SMARTPHONES AND YOUTUBE WEREN'T AROUND TV SHOWS MOVIES AND ANY OTHER MEDIUM AREN'T STEALING PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE READ BOOKS OTHERWISE

SOME MEDIA JUST WORK BETTER FOR SOME PEOPLE AND ALL MEDIA ARE A LEGITIMATE WAY TO TELL A STORY SPREAD KNOWLEDGE
DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING WHEN STARING AT THEIR PHONES ALTHOUGH I'VE NOW BACK TO READING MOSTLY PHYSICAL BOOKS FOR A FEW YEARS I READ MOSTLY AND ONCE I GOT A PHONE WITH A SIX-INCH SCREEN THAT WAS MY PRIMARY DREADER SO IF I HAD MY PHONE OUT AT LEAST HALF THE TIME I WAS READING A BOOK

AND I ALSO DON'T TALK ABOUT BOOKS SURE I'LL POST HERE AND ON OTHER SUBS OCCASIONALLY BUT OTHERWISE IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING I TALK ABOUT EVEN TO FRIENDS WHO I KNOW ALSO READ A LOT SOME OF WHOM READ MANY OF THE SAME BOOKS I DO IT'S A SOLITARY PASTIME A PRIVATE PLEASURE

OF COURSE IT'S ALSO A QUESTION OF THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU
THOUGHT MCCRYSTAL WAS THE WARRIOR MONK THIS GUY WAS CALLED MAD DOG
MAD DOG IS THE MAN
THIS THREAD HAS BEEN LOCKED DUE TO MULTIPLE RULE VIOLATIONS

IF YOU CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS SUBREDDIT PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO READ OUR RULES
I DEEPLY RESPECT MORRISON AS AN AUTHOR SO I'M CONFUSED THAT ANYONE WOULD FEEL THE NEED TO CRITICIZE HER CHOICE OF TOPICS AND THEME AFTER LIKE YEARS OF WRITING PEOPLE WRITE ABOUT THEIR LIFE AND PERSPECTIVE HAS GOTTA BE WRITING RULE 2 AFTER YOU USE WORDS
WHAT A TERRIBLE AND CONFUSING ARTICLE POORLY WRITTEN MIXING THE TALE OF THE AUTHOR HER WORKS HER NEWEST WORK AND THE MASSIVE SUBJECT OF RACE IN AMERICA
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT BEING A WRITER IS THAT YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT HOWEVER YOU WANT AND YOU NEVER HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR IT BECAUSE YOU ARE WRITING FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE YOUR WORK NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T
I DON'T KNOW IF THE ARTICLE IS JUST THAT POORLY WRITTEN OR IF PEOPLE WANT TO MISUNDERSTAND HER BUT THESE COMMENTS ARE CRAZY
THIS IS NOT AN ACCURATE QUOTE OP IT TAKES SOME SERIOUS GALL TO EDIT MORRISON
WHY ARE WE SHARING NEWS ARTICLES THAT ARE OVER A YEAR OLD ALSO I'M PRETTY SURE THIS WAS POSTED HERE WHEN IT INITIALLY CAME OUT
WHAT PROMPTED HER TO SAY THIS ALL AUTHORS WRITE FROM THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCE WHY DID SHE FEEL LIKE SHE HAD TO CLARIFY THIS I'VE NEVER THOUGHT TO MYSELF TONI MORRISON NEEDS TO WRITE MORE WHITE GUY BOOKS BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE DAFT
SUPER UNRELATED BUT THIS REMINDED ME OF HIGH SCHOOL MY BUDDIES AND I WOULD WRITE IN TONI MORRISON ANYTIME WE DIDN'T KNOW AN ANSWER IN AP LITERAL THE TEACHER THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY WHEN SHE'D GET TESTS BACK THAT SAID TONI MORRISON EVEN THOUGH WE NEVER DISCUSSED HER WORK GOOD TIMES
RHETORICAL TRIANGLE PEOPLE AUDIENCE PURPOSE AND APPEAL NOT ALL NOVELS ARE WRITTEN FOR ALL AUDIENCES
LIKE I ALWAYS SAY WRITE FOR YOURSELF IF YOU WRITE FOR SOMEONE ELSE YOU WILL BE DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR WORK WRITING HAS TO HAVE YOUR EMOTIONS AND YOUR THOUGHTS PUT INTO IT YOU SHOULDN'T TRY TO MIMIC SOMEONE ELSE TO SATIATE AN AUDIENCE YOU HAVE NEVER MET
IF I'M GOING TO BE HONEST I'M NOT SURE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IN GENERAL HAS THAT MUCH IN COMMON WITH TOLSTOY
YOU MAY NOT BE WRITING FOR ME A YEAR OLD WHITE GIRL BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOUR WORKS
THE SELF INDULGENT AND PRETENTIOUS ALWAYS MAKE BOLD STATEMENTS LIKE THIS

SHE IS AN AVERAGE WRITER AT BEST AND JUST BECAUSE SHE WRITES ABOUT THE OPPRESSION OF BLACK PEOPLE DOES NOT MAKE HER SAFE FROM CRITICS OF ANY COLOR

MOST HER WORK IS INCOHERENT AND HER SELF-COMPARISON TO TOLSTOY IS BEYOND LAUGHABLE
SAUL BELLOW WHO IS THE MUCH BETTER WRITER DIDN'T THINK SHE DESERVED THE NOBEL HE WAS CORRECT
I HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS FROM LORAIN OHIO YOU WOULD THINK MORE PEOPLE WOULD TALK ABOUT AND HAVE PRIDE IN THAT
HER REACTION TO THE ELECTION FEATURED IN THE NEW YORKER IS WORTH A READ

EDIT DOWNVOTED BY RACISTS LOL
THAT'S ABOUT THE MOST RACIST THING I'VE READ LATELY

SO BASICALLY IF YOU ARE WHITE HER BOOKS ARE NOT FOR YOU BUT TOLSTOY IS ONLY FOR WHITE PEOPLE AND NOT FOR BLACK GIRLS IN LOUISIANA FOR THAT MATTER I DON'T KNOW ANY WHO CAN READ TOLSTOY
IT WASN'T THAT HE WASN'T WRITING FOR YOU TONI IT'S THAT HE WAS WRITING FOR HIMSELF AND HIS PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES JUST LIKE YOU'RE DOING ALSO BLACK AUTHORS HAD BOOKS OUT WHEN YOU WERE
SHE IS RACIST PURE AND SIMPLE IF PEOPLE DON'T START SPEAKING UP ABOUT WHAT THE LEFT IS DOING NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE REAL RACISM SERIOUSLY YOU CAN'T GIVE ONE SIDE A PASSIVE THOSE DAYS ARE OVER
COOL BUT DON'T COMPARE YOURSELF TO TOLSTOY
OH PLEASE TOLSTOY WROTE FOR EVERYBODY
AND NOW I AM IMAGINING A TYLER PERRY WAR AND PEACE BLACKSPLOITATION MADIA AS NAPOLEON
REMOVED
I WRITE FOR WHITE ATHEISTS ONLY
I DON'T THINK TOLSTOY WAS WRITING FOR HER YEAR OLD SELF CONSIDERING THAT HE HAD BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS
REMOVED
THE DEFINITIVE BB
QUITE A SHOCK I READ JOURNEY AND LUCY GAULT AGES AGO PLUS SOME OF HIS SHORT STORIES LOVED HIS WORK BUT HE'S SOMEONE I READ AT A CERTAIN POINT IN MY LIFE LIKE MCEWAN AND A FEW OTHERS BUT NOT MUCH ANYMORE
FANTASTIC WRITER INTELLIGENT INSIGHTFUL FUNNY DECENT AND HUMANE HE WAS A MASTER CRAFTSMAN
R BOOKS COMMENTS

DARFUR
YA VERY SAD HE WAS GREAT WRITER
YOU NEED A LIBRARY CARD FROM ANOTHER LIBRARY IF YOU HAVE A CHILDHOOD LIBRARY CARD YOU MAY BE ABLE TO RENEW THAT REGISTER WITH YOUR COLLEGE LIBRARY IF YOU HAVE ONE AND IF THEY WORK WITH OVERDRIVE MINE OFFERS LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP BUT ISN'T IN OD OR IF YOU'RE IN COLLEGE REGISTER WITH A LOCAL LIBRARY AS WELL AND RENEW THE CARD AS NEEDED FINALLY RENEW CARDS WITH WHATEVER PLACES YOU HAVE LIVED YOU MAY NEED TO SHOW UP IN PERSON AND CONFIRM YOUR ADDRESS BUT IT MAY WELL BE WORTH IT

THERE ARE ALSO SOME LIBRARIES WITH YOU CAN BUY ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY MONEY
I LIVE IN AN AREA THAT HAS RECIPROCITY BETWEEN LIBRARY SYSTEMS SO I HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THREE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS BUT I ONLY USE TWO THE OFFERINGS DO INDEED DIFFER AS DO THE WAIT TIMES

SO IF YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GET INTO MULTIPLE LIBRARY SYSTEMS IT'S EASY
YEAH I HAVE FOUR LIBRARIES THAT I BELONG TO AND THEY ALL HAVE OVERDRIVE ACCESS YOU JUST ADD A LIBRARY THE WAY YOU DID AT THE BEGINNING YOU CAN'T BROWSE ALL THE HOLDINGS AT ONCE THOUGH SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BOOK YOU HAVE TO LOOK THROUGH EACH LIBRARY'S OFFERINGS SEPARATELY
LIBRARIAN HERE YOU'RE CORRECT IN THAT YOU CAN'T DO AN LOAN WITH AN BOOK HOWEVER YOU CAN GET AROUND THE SYSTEM BY HAVING LIBRARY CARDS WITH OTHER LIBRARY SYSTEMS SOME LARGER CITY LIBRARIES ALLOW PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE STATE TO GET A LIBRARY CARD I'M IN MASSACHUSETTS AND ANYONE WHO LIVES IN THE STATE CAN GET A BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY CARD IF YOU HAVE ANY RELATIVES IN OTHER CITIES SEE IF YOU CAN USE THEIR LIBRARY CARD INFO TO GET OVERDRIVE MATERIALS SINCE THERE ARE NO FINES ASSOCIATED WITH OVERDRIVE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT

YOU CAN NOW SUGGEST A PURCHASE ON THE NEW OVERDRIVE SITE DEPENDING ON THE BUDGET OF YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY THEY MAY PURCHASE A BOOK IF YOU ASK FINALLY LOOK INTO HOOPLA AS WELL AND SEE IF YOUR LIBRARY HAS IT IT'S SIMILAR TO OVERDRIVE BUT EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE SO THERE IS NO WAITING AND THERE ARE MOVIES TV SHOWS AND MUSIC ALONG WITH BOOKS AND AUDIOBOOKS THEY ALSO HAVE AN AMAZING COLLECTION OF COMICS

I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO HEAR PEOPLE ARE USING AND LIKING OVERDRIVE
IN SHORT HE'S THE REASON WE'RE USING THE ENGLISH WE'RE USING NOW IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM WE'D BE STUCK IN YE OLDE ENGLISH AND WORDS LIKE AROUSE DAUNTLESS LACKLUSTER IMPEDE TORTURE LABEL AND LONELY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AROUND

HE EXISTED IN A TIME WHEN ENGLISH WASN'T AS DEVELOPED
BECAUSE HE'S JUST THE GREATEST WRITER IN THE LANGUAGE MAYBE ANY LANGUAGE IT'S ALMOST UNREAL

WHAT LANGUAGE ARE YOU READING HIM IN

TO UNPACK THAT WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN A RESPONSE ON REDDIN BUT I'LL THROW SOME TIDBITS

FROM HAROLD BLOOM WHO WORSHIPS SHAKESPEARE

IF I COULD QUESTION ANY DEAD AUTHOR IT WOULD BE SHAKESPEARE AND I WOULD NOT WASTE MY SECONDS BY ASKING THE IDENTITY OF THE DARK LADY OR THE PRECISELY NUANCED ELEMENTS OF HOMOEROTICISM IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SOUTHAMPTON OR ANOTHER NAIVELY I WOULD BLURT OUT DID IT COMFORT YOU TO HAVE FASHIONED WOMAN AND MEN MORE REAL THAN LIVING MEN AND WOMEN HAROLD BLOOM GENIUS PAGE

I AM ALWAYS ASTONISHED THAT HE EMPLOYED MORE THAN TWENTY-ONE THOUSAND SEPARATE WORDS OF THESE HE INVENTED ROUGHLY ONE OUT OF THE TWELVE ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED COINAGES MANY OF THEM NOW IN COMMON USE RACINE SUPERBLY PRACTICING AN ART ANTITHETICAL TO USED TWO THOUSAND WORDS NOT MANY MORE THAN SHAKESPEARE COINED

AND THIS BLOG POST ADDS SOME THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF WHY SHAKESPEARE WAS SO GREAT MATERIAL OUT THERE








TO ME THE BLOSSOM OF MEANING FROM SIMPLE PREMISES OF HIS PLAYS MAKES HIM GREAT COMBINED WITH HIS SKILLS FOR COMPOSITION OF COURSE
NO ONE CAN GRASP WHAT HAMLET IS ALL ABOUT IT DEFIES ANY SORT OF ANALYSIS ON ALL LEVELS THIS PLAY WILL STILL BE TALKED ABOUT IN YEARS TIME WHEN THE LAST PEOPLE LEFT ALIVE ARE DYING
KNOWING SHAKESPEARE HAS BECOME THE DEFAULT WAY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN EDUCATED PEOPLE AND IGNORANT FUCKS
THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE IS RESPONSIBLE IN A BIG WAY FOR THE WAY WE READ AND WRITE TODAY HE IS CREDITED WITH BEING THE FIRST WRITER TO USE PROSE IN HIS WRITINGS THIS MEANT IT WAS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE COMMON RABBLE THAN MANY IF NOT ALL WORKS PRIOR HIS WORKS WERE ALSO IN MANY WAYS COMMENTARY ON THE SOCIAL ECONOMICAL AND POLITICAL CLIMATE OF HIS TIME

HIS CHARACTERS WERE EXTREMELY HUMAN AND MORE NUANCED THAN WHAT WAS COMMON AT THE TIME THIS MEANT THEY WERE MORE RELATABLE HE BROKE EVERY CONVENTION IN THE BOOK EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO CREATE HIS OWN WORDS HE LITERALLY THOUGHT THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH WORDS TO EXPRESS WHAT HE WANTED TO AND SO HE MADE WORDS UP THOUSANDS IN FACT THOUSANDS OF WHICH WE STILL USE TODAY FABULOUS WORDS LIKE OBSCENE ADDICTION AND BLUSHING HE IS THE DEFINITION OF THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX HIS WORK ACTUALLY CHANGED THE WAY WE SPEAK THINK READ AND WRITE BECAUSE HE WAS SO MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE AND RELATABLE TO THE COMMON PEOPLE WHERE MOST PRIOR WORKS OF LITERATURE WERE INTENDED FOR THE RICH AND EDUCATED

I'M PULLING ALL THIS INFO FROM MY MEMORY OF MY SHAKESPEARE CLASSES IN UNI MANY YEARS AGO SO I MAY BE A LITTLE OFF BUT THAT'S THE GIST OF IT I BELIEVE
NUMBER WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU KEY THING IS YOU'RE READING AND SETTING GOALS
DO WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU I USUALLY RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST GETTING INTO READING SET A TIME LIMIT FOR THEMSELVES LIKE READ MIN BEFORE YOU GOING TO BED OR SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT SETTING A PAGE LIMIT ALSO WORKS

I WONDER THOUGH DO YOU EVER READ PAST THE LIMIT YOU SET FOR YOURSELF IF YOU ARE REALLY INTO THE BOOK
I'M A READ A CHAPTER SPEND A MINUTE THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT SET A GOAL TO FINISH THE NEXT CHAPTER I FIND I REMEMBER A LOT MORE THIS WAY

REALLY AS LONG AS YOU'RE READING AND ENJOYING IT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT TRICKS AND TIPS YOU USE ON THE WAY
IF IT WORKS FOR YOU WHY WORRY ABOUT IT
AS A VIDEO GAME ACHIEVEMENT ADDICT I NEED TO TRACK MY PROGRESS TO TO KEEP ACTIVE WITH MY READING

CAN'T IMPROVE WHAT YOU DON'T MEASURE
I'VE BEEN AN AVID READER THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND I GENERALLY HAVE A PAGE MINIMUM GOAL FOR EACH DAY THAT I HAVE TO REACH BEFORE I LET MYSELF WATCH TELEVISION AS MUCH AS I ENJOY READING ONCE I START IT'S EASY TO LEAVE MY BOOK ON THE TABLE ONCE IT'S CLOSED I HAVE TO KIND OF MAKE MYSELF READ THE FIRST LITTLE BIT THEN I'M BACK INTO IT AND ENGAGED IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT WORKS FOR YOU TOO THEN GO WITH IT
AS EVERYONE ELSE SAYS DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU ONE DAY YOU WILL FIND A BOOK AND INSTEAD OF JUST ANOTHER PAGE AND I CAN FINISH IT WILL BECOME I WILL ONLY READ ONE MORE PAGE THEN I REALLY MUST STOP USUALLY SAID FOR ABOUT FIVE OR SIX PAGES BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY PUT THE BOOK DOWN
I USED TO GIVE EVERY BOOK PAGES TO TRY AND SELL ME ON IT

NOW I'M OLD AND GRUMPY YOU GET TWO MAYBE THREE CHAPTERS OR I'M DONE WITH YOU
YES IT'S WRONG YOU BELONG IN BOOK JAIL
WHY WOULD IT BE WRONG
IF I'M READING SOMETHING I HAVE TO READ TILL THE END OF THE CHAPTER IF JUST SO I KNOW WHERE I'M AT WHEN I CAN START AGAIN
NO WHO CARES
NAH DO WHAT MOTIVATES YOU IT'S NOT LIKE A NOVEL WILL ALWAYS GRAB YOUR ATTENTION THE SECOND YOU SIT DOWN WITH IT IT DOES TAKE EFFORT TO GET IMMERSED AT THE START OF A SESSION SO SETTING A GOAL CAN BE NICELY MOTIVATING

I LIKE TO PUT MY BOOKMARK AT THE END OF THE CHAPTER I'M READING AND AIM TO GET THERE PERSONALLY SAME CONCEPT
THERE ARE NO READING POLICE
YES I'VE INFORMED THE POLICE
YOU WANTED MY THOUGHTS HERE YOU GO WRONG IS A RIDICULOUS WORD TO THROW AROUND HAPHAZARDLY AND USE TO JUDGE YOURSELF BY AND FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE DO IT MAKE CHOICES THAT CAUSE COMFORT AND HAPPINESS FOR YOU DO THINGS THE WAY YOU LIKE TO AND STOP CALLING YOURSELVES WRONG FOR DOING SO
I CAN'T SAY ABOUT OTHERS BUT FOR ME THE PINNACLE OF A READING EXPERIENCE IS WHEN YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY PAGES YOU'VE JUST READ TURNING PAGES BECOMES ALMOST SUBCONSCIOUS IT'S ONLY WHEN I PAUSE FOR A MOMENT THAT I REALISE HOLY SHIT I JUST FINISHED A HUNDRED PAGES

HOWEVER SOME BOOKS ARE NOTICEABLY TOUGHER TO GET THROUGH SO READING GOALS ARE PRAGMATIC ALTHOUGH BF THE ARGUMENT OF DON'T DO WHAT YOU DON'T ENJOY HAS SOME MERIT TO IT
SOMETIMES EVEN I DON'T KNOW IF I AM READING TO READ OR READING TO HAVE READ THAT IS READING SO I CAN BRAG MOSTLY TO MYSELF THAT I READ X PAGES AND READ Y BOOK IS THAT SIMILAR I SUPPOSE IT EXTENDS TO MORE THAN JUST READING IN MY CASE BUT THAT IS ANOTHER THING ENTIRELY
UGH HOW DARE YOU ENJOY A RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY THE WAY YOU WANT TO

NAH BAH YOU KEEP DOING YOU
WELL I GREW UP WITH BOTH VIDEO GAMES AND BOOKS AROUND AND THE TWO BECAME COMPLETELY SEPARATE THINGS IN BOOKS I AM DROWNED IF I CAN'T FORCE MYSELF TO GET OUT I CAN READ FOR HOURS WITH NO PROBLEMS IN VIDEO GAMES I CAN'T STAND SANDBOXES FREEDOM IS MORE OF A CURSE FOR ME THERE I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I ALWAYS NEED A GOAL THERE

EITHER ONE IS FINE IF IT GETS YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO I USE BOOKS AS A KIND OF A WAIT OPTION LIKE IN TES GAMES PRESS T TO WAIT I READ IN SUBWAY BUSES PLANES I READ WHEN I HAVE A LOT OF FREE TIME AND NOTHING ELSE TO DO WITH IT AND OF COURSE I READ ON THE TOILET
WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU TO MOTIVATE YOU TO READ IF THIS WORKS FOR YOU THEN THAT'S GREAT

PERSONALLY I JUST READ UNTIL I START GETTING TIRED I READ BEFORE BED MOSTLY AND THE ONLY TIME I SET GOALS ARE ACTUALLY FOR THE OPPOSITE REASON AS YOU IT'S WHEN I CAN'T PUT A BOOK DOWN BECAUSE IT'S SO GOOD SO I WILL TELL MYSELF THAT AT THE END OF THE NEXT CHAPTER OR NEXT PAGE BREAK I WILL PUT THE BOOK DOWN OR ELSE I COULD BE READING UNTIL LIKE
HEY GUYS IS IT WRONG FOR ME TO SET A GOAL TO PROMOTE A GOOD HABIT
YES IT'S ABSOLUTELY MORALLY WRONG YOU'RE A MONSTER BUT I LOVE IT I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU
IT IS VERY WRONG YOU SHOULD REPENT YOUR SINS IMMEDIATELY
THIS IS THE BIG DILEMMA YOU'RE FACING RIGHT NOW
I DO THAT SOMETIMES OTHER TIMES IT MAKES ME HATE IT BECAUSE I FORCE MYSELF TO KEEP READING EVEN IF I GET BORED OR WANNA DO SOMETHING ELSE
SOME BOOKS ARE A PLEASURE TO READ SOME A CHALLENGE OTHERS A TEST OF ENDURANCE WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF READING IT IF YOU READ PAGES AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT YOU JUST READ SLOW DOWN STOP AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU READ OCCASIONALLY YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE OUT OF YOUR BOOK AND FEEL LESS EXHAUSTED IF YOU DO AS YOU GO
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH WHAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED
AS LONG AS YOU TRULY ENJOY IT READ HOWEVER YOU WANT
YES IT'S WRONG HOW DARE YOU STOP IMMEDIATELY OF COURSE IT'S NOT WRONG DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO
OH MY A POST I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH WHEN I HAVE TROUBLE READING A BOOK I HAVE THESE BOOKMAKERS THAT I USE ALONG WITH MY TRADITIONAL BOOKMARKER I MARK AND OF THE BOOK

IT MOTIVATES ME ONLY PAGES TO BOOT I JUST HIT READ HOME STRETCH

I ALSO TOOK THE CHALLENGE OF READING BOOKS IN WEEKS YOU CAN PICK ANY AMOUNT OF BOOKS TO READ IN A YEAR I MADE BOOKMAKERS THAT SAY DAY DAY IF I WANT TO READ A BOOK IN DAYS I DIVIDE IT UP BEFORE I START IT HELPS WHENEVER I HAVE DOWN TIME I KNOW I HAVE PAGES UNTIL I AM DONE WITH DAY TWO READING

IT GIVES ME A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND FOR ME IT MAKES A NONFICTION BOOK SEEM A LITTLE LESS INTIMIDATING
EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS GREAT AND WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF BOOKS I DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF I'M READING SOMETHING DIFFICULT AND DENSE AKA SERIOUS LITERATURE I WILL FORCE MYSELF TO PUSH ON THROUGH DIFFICULT PASSAGES OTHERWISE THOUGH IF I'M JUST READING EASIER BOOKS FOR FUN I JUST BREEZE THROUGH A BOOK AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT HOWEVER I HAVE READ BOOKS FOR FUN ALL MY LIFE SO IT'S EASIER FOR ME IF YOU KEEP IT UP YOU SHOULD EVENTUALLY GET TO A POINT WHERE IT'S JUST SECOND NATURE AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO SET THESE GOALS ANYMORE
YES YOU SHOULD AIM TO READ IN MULTIPLES OF SEVEN PLUS YOUR AGE MINUS THE NUMBER OF LIVING GRANDPARENTS YOU HAVE AGE LIVING GRANDPARENTS

IF YOU DON'T DO THIS ANY DEAD GRANDPARENTS WILL ZOMBIEFY AND HUNT YOU DOWN IF ALL GRANDPARENTS ARE LIVING DISREGARD BUT REMEMBER
IS IT A BAD THING THAT I THOUGHT IN THE TITLE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A TARGET PAGE OF REDDIN

FACEPALM
WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU I SOMETIMES DO THIS WITH BOOKS THAT AREN'T AS MUCH FUN BUT THAT I WANT TO COMPLETE I DON'T USUALLY NEED TO WHEN I REALLY ENJOY A BOOK USUALLY IT'S THE OPPOSITE AND I HAVE TO LIMIT MYSELF

MY ONLY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO RECONSIDER WHAT YOU'RE READING SELF HELP BOOKS ARE ONE THING BUT WHEN IT'S FICTION ALLOW YOURSELF TO CHOOSE WHAT INTERESTS YOU I THINK SOME NEW READERS GET IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD READ BUT YOU CAN SAVE THAT FOR LATER
I DON'T THINK ANY STRATEGY THAT GETS YOU TO READ MORE IS WRONG I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM SO I MAKE A CUP OF TEA OR SOMETHING AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO STOP READING UNTIL IT'S GONE BUT BY THEN I'M ALREADY PRETTY INTO THE BOOK AND CAN CONTINUE WITHOUT THE RULE BUT THAT RULE MAKES IT A LOT EASIER FOR ME TO PICK UP A BOOK
WHY WOULD IT BE WRONG YOU READ HOWEVER YOU WANT TO READ FRANKLY I THINK THAT THIS IS A STUPID QUESTION
NOT IF YOU ENJOY THE BOOKS I'LL GIVE YOU TWO DIFFERENT THOUGHTS ON THIS SINCE I DO THIS MYSELF QUITE A LOT

IN ESSENCE I THINK IT'S A PRAGMATIC HABIT THE MOMENT I START A BOOK I ASK MYSELF HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE ME TO FINISH IT NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO GET IT OVER WITH BUT BECAUSE I WANT TO TAKE IT IN WHILE IT'S FRESH AND WHILE I'M NOT ALREADY INTERESTED IN OTHER BOOKS WHICH IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT ISSUE

2 IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL TO THINK THAT WAY IF YOU'RE ONLY STARTING TO READ FOR FUN I STARTED READING HEAVILY AGAIN YEARS AGO AND IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN EASY I STILL REMEMBER BEING PROUD OF MYSELF FOR READING SOME PAGES FROM THE HUNGER GAMES IN ONE SITTING YOU DO HAVE TO FORCE THE ISSUE A BIT WHEN IT COMES TO READ AND DEVELOPING A HABIT

SO ALL IN ALL NO IT'S NOT WRONG BUT MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MISTAKE THAT FOR NOT LIKING A BOOK THEN IT'S TIME TO LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT ONE
ABSOLUTELY NOT I DO THE SAME THING IT'S COOL
I USED TO USE CHAPTER METHOD NOWADAYS I KINDA READ AS MUCH AS I CAN
READING IS FOR FUN WHY THE NEED TO SET GOALS
IF IT'S WRONG I DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT
I USE MY KINDLE SO I TELL MYSELF TO GET TO A CERTAIN PERCENT DONE BEFORE I CAN GIVE IN TO MY ADDENDUM
I USUALLY READ UNTIL I GET BORED AND THEN I CHECK HOW MUCH THERE IS LEFT UNTIL NEXT CHAPTER AND IF IT IS CLOSER THAN PAGES THAN I WOULD GO TO IT IT IT'S MORE THEN I WILL READ COUPLE OF PAGES BUT WHATEVER WORKS AS LONG AS YOU ENJOY READING EVEN IF YOU WANT TO FLIP THE BOOK UPSIDE DOWN ON EVERY PRIME NUMBER IT WOULD BE FINE
RECENTLY I HAD A BUNCH OF REQUESTS AT THE LIBRARY AND OF COURSE THEY ALL ARRIVED WITHIN A FEW DAYS I HAD TO SET DAILY QUOTAS SO THAT I COULD A ACTUALLY FINISH READING THEM AND B NOT RUIN THE PLEASURE BY RUSHING NOW THEY'RE READ BACK AT THE LIBRARY AND I'M READING A MAGAZINE FROM JULY
ABSOLUTELY NOT DON'T LET THE PEOPLE HERE WHO READ FAST MAKE YOU FEEL INFERIOR READING FAST IS NOT THE OBJECTIVE THE IDEA BEHIND READING IS TO LET THE WORDS WASH OVER YOU USE YOUR IMAGINATION AND LET THE BOOK CHANGE YOUR LIFE IF YOU HAVE TO PUSH YOURSELF THROUGH THE BOOK LIKE I HAD TO DO WITH WINGS OF THE DOVE IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT IT'S THE WRITER'S FAULT FOR MAKING A BOOK THAT TORTUOUS TO HIS HER READERS
EH I THINK IT'S FINE I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED READING WELL SINCE I WAS ANYHOW AND I DO THAT TO THIS DAY GOALS ARE FINE WHETHER IT'S TO MOTIVATE YOU WHICH IS A NOBLE CAUSE OR SIMPLY TO SET POINTS TO STOP AT TO ALLOW INFORMATION DIGESTION ANYWAY JUST KEEP DOING YOU
I DO THE SAME THING HERE IS MY SET PAGES PER SESSION A DAY
I THINK A GOOD BOOK SHOULD COMPEL YOU TO READ IT IT'S OK TO START BOOKS AND ONLY FINISH ONE MANY PEOPLE FEEL GUILTY ABOUT ABANDONING A BOOK AND THEREFORE HATE READING BECAUSE THEY GET STUCK ON CRAPPY BOOKS

WE WILL QUICKLY FLIP FROM A POOR TV SHOW BUT FEEL A DIFFERENT OBLIGATION TO A BOOK IMO LEARNING TO ENJOY READING AS AN ADULT TO HAVE TO GET PAST THE READERS GUILT THING
THAT'S NOT WRONG MY FATHER ALWAYS TOLD ME TO DIVIDE THE NUMBER OF PAGES BY THE NUMBER OF DAYS
EAST G YOUR BOOK HAS PAGES YOU WANT HAVE TO READ IT IN DAYS PAGES A DAY
I USE THAT FOR COLLEGE TOO AND IT'S REALLY HELPFUL
FOR MYSELF A GOOD BOOK SHOULD WRAP YOU UP ENOUGH THAT YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE THE PAGE OR TIME
HOWEVER I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU ARE GETTING INTO READING SO YOU DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU
BUT HOW ABOUT A TIMER INSTEAD MAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME YOUR GOAL AND INCREASE IT AS YOU GO I WOULD THINK IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT WHAT PAGE YOU'RE ON IT WOULD BE DISTRACTING MAKING IT HARD FOR YOU TO GET INTO THE STORY
OH HONEY THIS IS A GOOD MINDSET IF IT HELPS YOU ITS HOW THEY TEACH KIDS TO READ IN MY STATE SO I DON'T SEE HOW IT COULD HURT ANYTHING FOR ME I ALWAYS GIVE MYSELF UNTIL THE END OF THE CHAPTER IF I KNOW THAT I HAVE A SHORT TIME TO READ IF I HAVE LONGER I DON'T LIMIT MYSELF I'M AN AVID READER BETWEEN NOW I THINK I'VE READ ROUGHLY DIFFERENT BOOKS AND A COUPLE I READ OVER AGAIN
AS AN ENGLISH LIT STUDENT I DO THIS QUITE A LOT ESPECIALLY WITH BOOKS THAT DON'T INTEREST ME
I'M NOT SURE THERE IS A RIGHT MINDSET THE WAY YOU SPEAK OF READING IS HOW I FEEL ABOUT EXERCISE AND THAT IS OKAY PERSONALLY WITH MORE DIFFICULT BOOKS I MOST CERTAINLY SET A GOAL FOR THAT SESSION FOR EASIER READS I ACTUALLY TRY TO LIMIT IT AND DRAW THE BOOK OUT BECAUSE I'VE READ SOME BOOKS IN A DAY OR SO WHICH CAN FEEL RUSHED
IF YOU'RE READING FOR SELF-IMPROVEMENT THEN OF COURSE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SETTING A PAGE GOAL PER SESSION WE DO THE SAME THING WHEN WE PHYSICALLY EXERCISE DON'T WE

BUT I DO THINK YOU SHOULD TRY TO COAX YOURSELF TOWARD THE POINT THAT YOU JUST READ FOR WHATEVER LENGTH OF TIME FEELS INTUITIVE FOR THAT SESSION YOU'LL ENJOY IT MORE ULTIMATELY BUT DON'T STRESS ABOUT IT JUST KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND EVENTUALLY IT'LL HAPPEN ON ITS OWN I THINK
AS A WRITER I SOMETIMES HAVE TO SET GOALS OF GETTING TO A CERTAIN PAGE FINISHING A CHAPTER OUTLINING A CHAPTER ETC I FIND IT HILARIOUS TO THINK THAT A FUTURE READER WOULD SET READING GOALS WHICH ALIGN WITH MY WRITING GOALS
I LOVE BOOKS BUT I FIND IT VERY HARD TO READ WHEN IT ISN'T SUMMER THE DARKNESS MAKE ME SLOW AND TIRED AND USUALLY FALL ASLEEP INSTEAD OF READING

I OFTEN DO A SIMILAR THING THAT YOU SAY MAKE A GOAL FOR ME IT ALSO VERY MUCH DEPENDS ON THE BOOK SOME BOOK I ENJOY BUT IS HARD TO MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH OTHER THE HOURS JUST RUN AWAY

THERE ARE NO RULES WITH READING NO ACHIEVEMENTS JUST YOU AND A GOOD STORY READ THE WAY THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH
YOU ABSOLUTE MADMAN YOU'RE LUCKY I'M NOT CALLING THE INTERNET POLICE ON YOUR WILD ANTICS
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS
I FEEL LIKE A TIME GOAL OR LIMIT MAKES MORE SENSE IF YOU WANT TO FORCE YOURSELF TO GET INTO IT
THERE'S NO WRONG WAY TO READ A BOOK



EXCEPT FLIPPING TO THE LAST PAGE FIRST TO SEE HOW IT ENDS THAT'S JUST PLAIN WRONG
WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU
DEPENDING ON THE BOOK AND WHEN I ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND READ I TRY TO MAKE MYSELF FINISH ONE COMPLETE CHAPTER
I ADHERE TO ONE RULE WHEN MY EYELIDS ARE DROOPING I TEND TO STOP BUT HAVING A PAGE GOAL EH UP TO YOU AS LONG AS YOU STILL ENJOY READING
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH MOTIVATING YOURSELF TO READ I DO THE PAGE GOAL THING ALL THE TIME
I ALMOST ALWAYS GO INTO READING WITH PAGE GOALS WHICH IS WHY I GREATLY APPRECIATE BOOKS WITH MANY CHAPTER PART BREAKS

BUT OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR READING GOALS TO TAKE OVER THE PLEASURE OF READING THIS IS ADVICE I NEED TO GET BETTER AT TAKING MYSELF
IF IT'S DRY MATERIAL I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU I'M AN ECONOMICS AND MATH MAJOR AND WHEN YOU'RE READING DRY ACADEMIC PAPERS THAT ARE RAMBLING ON FOR A MILLION PAGES THEN SETTING A PAGE GOAL IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET THROUGH

ALSO TRUST ME WHEN I SAY NEITHER MATHEMATICIANS NOR ECONOMISTS KNOW HOW TO GET TO THE POINT IN THE FASTEST WAY POSSIBLE
WHAT'S WRONG IS THAT WE STILL READ BOOKS THAT DON'T INSPIRE US TO HIT THOSE PAGE COUNTS REGARDLESS
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA I REALLY DO WELL WHEN I'M WORKING TOWARD SOME KIND OF GOAL YOU CAN ALWAYS GO PAST THE GOAL
I HOPE NOT I DO THIS ALL THE TIME
BEFORE I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL AND WAS JUST WORKING FULL TIME I MADE THE GOAL OF READING ONE BOOK A MONTH I DIVIDED THE NUMBER OF PAGES BY THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN THE MONTH AND TRIED TO STICK TO THAT I NEVER READ ANYTHING REALLY MASSIVE SO IT WAS USUALLY UNDER A NIGHT WHICH IS MANAGEABLE SOME WEEKENDS I'D READ MORE TAKE SOME NIGHTS OFF DURING THE WEEK AS NEEDED HOPE THIS HELPS
I TRY TO MAKE A TIME TO READ DAILY DURING THE WEEK SO I GET UP AN HOUR BEFORE I HAVE TO LEAVE FOR WORK ENJOY A CUP OF COFFEE AND READ A CHAPTER IT'S KIND OF LIKE MY MOMENT OF ZEN BEFORE A TYPICALLY BUSY DAY BUT LIKE MOST HAVE SAID WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU IS PROBABLY YOUR BEST METHOD
I DO THIS SOMETIMES
RIGHT AND WRONG ARE SUBJECTIVE TERMS IF IT WORKS FOR YOU AND DOESN'T HARM ANYONE ELSE AND I MEAN REALLY HOW COULD IT IT CAN'T REALLY BE WRONG IF IT DOESN'T WORK IT'S THE WRONG APPROACH FOR YOU IT'S THAT SIMPLE
I ALWAYS TRIED TO GIVE A BOOK A CHANCE BUT AFTER PAGES OF ATLAS SHRUGGED I FELT ZERO QUALMS ABOUT BAILING OUT
KEEP IT SIMPLE
READ AT LEAST MINUTES A DAY

AMAZING HOW MUCH YOU'LL GET THROUGH IN A YEAR WITH THAT PLAN
YOU SHOULD AIM TO AT LEAST GIVE YOUR CHANCE TO GET INTO THE BOOK I WILL OFTEN BEGIN READING AND FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER NOT GET INTO IT I'LL THEN PICK UP WHERE I LEFT OFF THE NEXT DAY AND ALLOW MYSELF TO GET INTO IT AND I'M OFFICIAL
IF IT IS I DON'T WANNA BE RIGHT
I DIVIDE A BOOK TOTAL PAGE NUMBER BY AND DECIDE TO READ EVERY TIME ASSUMING IT ISN'T OVER SAY PAGES THEN I DO I FINISH A BOOK EVERY OR DAYS THAT WAY ON AVERAGE
I'M DEAD SET ON READING BOOKS IN AND FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE I WILL NOT PICK UP ANY BOOKS THICKER THAN PAGES THIS WOULD REQUIRE ME TO READ PAGES PER DAY WHICH SEEMS TOTALLY ACHIEVABLE
GENOCIDE IS WRONG READING GOALS HAVE NO MORAL IMPLICATIONS
USUALLY I READ TO A NATURAL BREAKING POINT VERY OFTEN I SAY I'M GOING TO READ FOR AN HOUR AND MAY READ A LITTLE LESS OR A LITTLE MORE DEPENDING

BEFORE I WAS DISABLED MY BIG JOY WAS LYING ON THE SOFA AND READING FOR HOURS STRAIGHT NOW IT'S MUCH HARDER BECAUSE I FATIGUE EASILY SO AN HOUR IS ABOUT ALL I CAN MANAGE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GET UP AND MOVE AROUND EVERY HOUR OR SO ANYWAY
IS IT WRONG TO SET A NUMBER OF BOOKS YOU HAVE TO READ YEAR MONTH OR SO
I DON'T HAVE A PAGE LIMIT MY AIM IS ONE CHAPTER THEN IF I'M REALLY INTO IT THEN I'LL CARRY ON TO THE END OF THAT CHAPTER

I TEND TO READ IN BED AND HATE IT WHEN MY EYES START DROPPING BEFORE I GET TO THE END OF THE CHAPTER
YES DON'T EVER DO OR AGAIN OR THE COOKIE MONSTER WILL EAT YOU
I'M GENUINELY STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS A REAL QUESTION AND WHY ANYONE WOULD THINK ANY WAY OF READING IS SOMEHOW WRONG WHAT AM I MISSING HERE
ARE YOU HURTING ANYONE ELSE

NO

YOU DO YOU
I JUST THINK I SHOULD READ QUICKLY TO GET TO THE EXCITING PARTS IN LESS EXCITING BITS AND THEN WHEN IT'S EXCITING I STOP CARING
I CAN'T SIT DOWN AND FLIP THROUGH PAGES DDK WHAT IT IS I HATE THE FEEL OF THE PAPER ON MY FINGERS SINCE MY HANDS ARE ALWAYS DRIED FROM WORKING ON CARS I'M ALWAYS CLEANING WORKING ON SOMETHING AT HOME PLAYING WITH MY SON OR JUST GENERALLY TAKING CARE OF HIM MONTHS OLD DOING RESEARCH FOR WORK OR SOMETHING ELSE I KNOW I CAN'T READ A BOOK THROUGH AS QUICKLY AS I WOULD WANT WITHOUT FORGETTING WTF WAS GOING ON IN THE LAST CHAPTER THE NEXT TIME I PICK IT UP SERIOUSLY I GOT THE NEW PAPER MARIO THE DAY IT CAME OUT AND I'VE PLAYED IT TWICE FOR HALF AN HOUR WHAT I'VE FOUND TO SCRATCH THE ITCH IS AUDIO BOOKS YOU EITHER LOVE THEM OR YOU DON'T EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT WHEN I'M AT WORK I HAVE MY HEADPHONES ON AND IT DOESN'T TAKE FOCUS AWAY FROM ANYTHING IF I LOSE FOCUS FROM WHAT I'M WORKING ON I JUST PLAYBACK WHEN I DRIVE I DO THE SAME AND I'M NOT FIDGETING WITH MY PHONE TO SET MUSIC ON FROM PONTIFY YOUTUBE OR ANYTHING THEY'RE GREAT MANUAL AMAZON HAS A DEAL GOING ON YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD AUDIBLES I'VE GONE THROUGH JOE HILL'S ENTIRE COLLECTION EACH ONE WITHOUT STOPPING ONCE I STARTED TIME FLIES BY AND YOU DON'T GET THE FEELING THAT YOU'RE NEEDING TO SET A GOAL FOR PAGES I USED TO DO THE SAME IT STRAINED MY EYES I'D LOSE FOCUS OR JUST SEE THE WORDS WITHOUT PROCESSING ACTUAL SENTENCES


THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH I TRIED IT BECAUSE I WAS BORED AND I CAN'T GET ENOUGH NOW
I RECENTLY ENCOURAGED MY SPOUSE TO DO JUST THIS HE HAS NEVER FINISHED A BOOK ASIDE FROM SCHOOL AND AT IT'S HARDER TO PICKUP HOPEFULLY HE'LL LISTEN I FIND IT ADORABLE WHEN HE READS
NO KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THAT IT HELPS TO HOLD AND PEN PENCIL EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE IT TO TAKE NOTES OR UNDERLINE AND KEEP YOUR PHONE OUT OF SIGHT AND OUT OF REACH BOTH KEEP YOUR MIND FOCUSED AND STIMULATED

ONCE YOU FIND A BOOK THAT BLOWS YOUR MIND YOU WON'T EVEN NEED TO DO A PAGE GOAL


ABSOLUTELY NOT
NO WAY JOS I SET PAGE GOALS FOR MYSELF WITH A LOT OF BOOKS SO THAT IT KEEPS ME FOCUSED ON THE BOOK OTHERWISE I HAVE A TENDENCY TO LEAVE BOOKS UNFINISHED OR UNTOUCHED
NO I DO THIS OFTEN AS A WAY TO HELP MYSELF STICK TO THE BOOK I HAVE A TERRIBLE ATTENTION SPAN AND NEED TO MAKE SURE I FINISH THE BOOK SOON SO I DON'T FORGET WHERE I'M AT SO I SAY I'LL READ TO PAGE I'LL READ MORE PAGES OR WHATEVER IT CAN BE EFFECTIVE BOOKMAKING
I DO THIS TOO CAUSE I GET DISTRACTED VERY EASILY IT WORKS GREAT AND ANYTHING THAT HELPS YOU READ IS GREAT
READ YOUR DAMN BOOK
THIS IS MY STORY WORD FOR WORD I LISTEN TO AUDIOBOOKS INSTEAD OF READING
I TELL MYSELF TILL A CERTAIN CHAPTER NUMBER SO NO NOTHING WRONG WITH SETTLING ON A PAGE
NUMBER THING IS TO READ WHAT YOU LIKE SCHOOLS ALWAYS SEEM TO MAKE YOU READ THE CLASSICS WHICH I HATE I'VE KIND OF MADE IT A RULE OF THUMB TO ONLY READ BOOKS PUBLISHED AFTER

AFTER THAT JUST SET A WINDOW OF TIME I ALWAYS READ AN HOUR BEFORE I GO TO BED BUT IF PAGES WORKS FOR YOU THEN STICK WITH IT YOU WILL GET INTO A GROOVE I SEE IT AS MY MEDITATION TO GET MY MIND OFF OF THINGS GOOD LUCK IT'S COMMENDABLE THAT YOU ARE DOING IT AS SUCH A YOUNG AGE I DIDN'T START TIL I WAS
I'M SO USED TO MULTITASKING WHEN I DO THINGS LIKE WATCHING NETFLIX AND BEING ON REDDIN SO FOR ME TO SIT DOWN AND JUST FOCUS ON ONE THING IS HARD WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO BE ABLE TO READ NON STOP I THINK I FINISHED THE HARRY POTTER SERIES IN A COUPLE MONTHS MY ATTENTION SPAN SUCKS NOW THOUGH SO I USUALLY TRY FOR JUST A CHAPTER A DAY OR SOMETHING
I DEFINITELY HAVE TO DO THIS TO GET THROUGH THE STALE PARTS OF A BOOK
A PAGE DESCRIPTION OF SCENERY CAN BE TOUGH LOOKING AT YOU DEAN KOONTZ
BUT ON FLIP SIDE I LOVED THE ENDING WHEN IT PICKED UP AND CHAPTERS BECAME 2 PAGES
YES VERY WRONG
WHY WOULD IT BE WRONG THAT'S LIKE ASKING IF THERE'S A WRONG WAY TO PLAY YOUR VIDEO GAME

I SUPPOSE THERE COULD BE A WRONG WAY TO PLAY A VIDEO GAME IN COMPETITIVE PLAY I EAST HACKING BUT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE COMPETITIVELY READING
I TRY AND READ EVERY EVENING BEFORE BED AND I USED TO HAVE A GOAL OF READING AT LEAST EVERY NIGHT EASIER TO KEEP TRACK OF WITH THE BOOKS THAT I READ AT NIGHT I STILL TRY FOR THIS GOAL BUT I DON'T ALWAYS STAY AWAKE LONG ENOUGH TO ACCOMPLISH IT HAHA
YES IT'S WRONG
NO IT'S NOT WRONG

ANY MORE STUPID QUESTIONS
WHEN I STARTED GETTING BACK INTO IT I JUST SAID TO MYEL CHAPTER BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP AND THATS IT

WELL THAT WORKED FOR LIKE A WEEK AFTER THAT I HAD TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT
EVER SINCE I WAS A KID IT WAS MORE OF SAYING HERE I'LL STOP AT THIS PAGE AND IT'LL BE LIKE 2 AM THEN HAHA
I SET GOALS WHEN I TAKE THE TIME TO READ TOO IT'S GIVES ME A SENSE OF MOTIVATION AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT ATTRIBUTE TO HAVE IN TERMS OF GETTING ANYTHING DONE
NOT AT ALL ALTHOUGH I USUALLY SUFFER FROM THE JUST ONE MORE PAGE SYNDROME SO I USUALLY GO PAST MY PLANNED MARK SOMETIMES IT'S A CASE OF JUST ONE MORE CHAPTER THAT DEFINITELY EXTENDS MY READING SESSIONS
I DO THE SAME THING WHATEVER GETS IT DONE
DO WHAT YOU WANT YOU'RE A GROWN-UP FFS
I FIND IF A BOOK IS GOOD I DON'T NEED TO SET TARGETS MIGHT BE YOU JUST HAVEN'T FOUND A BOOK YOU REALLY DIG YET I WAS LIKE YOU AND I ONLY STARTED READING LAST YEAR BUT I MADE SURE TO PICK BOOKS WITH GREAT REVIEWS IN A GENRE I'D ENJOY WHEN I HAVE A GOOD BOOK I THINK ABOUT IT A LOT AND TEND TO WANT TO READ IT RATHER THAN WATCH TV OR PLAY GAMES

I'VE READ A FEW GOOD BUT NOT GREAT BOOKS AND IT TENDS TO TAKE ME LONGER TO GET THROUGH THOSE BOOKS I USUALLY JUST TRY TO FIT IN AT LEAST ONE CHAPTER A DAY BOOKS WHERE I'M REALLY STRUGGLING I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF WHETHER IT IS WORTH FINISHING IF I DON'T ENJOY IT USUALLY I GIVE IT AWAY
I JUST TELL MYSELF I'LL AP AT THE END OF THIS BOOK VERY MOTIVATING BUT SINCE I'VE JOINED R NOMAP RIP
THE MORE YOU READ THE MORE YOU KNOW THE MORE YOU KNOW THE SMARTER YOU GROW THE SMARTER YOU GROW THE STRONGER YOUR VOICE WHEN SPEAKING YOUR MIND AND MAKING YOUR CHOICE AND THAT ON A POSTER IN MY SCHOOL LIBRARY WHEN I WAS A KID
WHAT TYPE OF BOOKS DO YOU REALLY ENJOY I THINK BOOKS IN A YEAR IS AMAZING ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WHO NEVER REALLY READ BEFORE YOU'LL FIND YOU ACTUALLY GET BETTER AT IT TO ME THE BEST BOOKS ARE THE ONES WHERE THE STORY IS SOO INTERESTING THAT I CAN'T STOP READING LIKE WHEN YOU WATCH A GREAT SHOW AND THE END OF THE EPISODE IS A CLIFF HANGER SO YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE NEXT SHOW YES I BINGE WATCH NETFLIX AND I BINGE READ BOOKS SOMETIMES UNTIL I LITERALLY CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
TRY READING IN BED WHEN IT'S ALL QUIET TRY TAKING A BOOK TO A PARK AND READING SOME PLACE PEACEFUL AND QUIET
I WOULDN'T SET A PAGE GOAL WHAT I THINK YOU NEED IS TO FIND A BOOK THAT'S SO INTERESTING EXCITING SCARY THAT YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
I ACTUALLY MIGHT TRY THAT I USED TO READ A TON WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND I LOVED IT BUT I HAVE BEEN DEPRESSED AND ANXIOUS LATELY BY LATELY I MEAN LIKE THE LAST YEARS AND IT'S SO HARD TO MAKE MYSELF DO IT I HAVE SO MANY BOOKS JUST SITTING ON MY SHELVES THAT I'VE BOUGHT AND REALLY WANT TO READ BUT CAN'T SEEM TO MOTIVATE MYSELF THANKS FOR THE INSPIRATION

ALSO GOOD FOR YOU FOR PUTTING IN THE EFFORT IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW IT GETS DONE READING IS AN ENTIRELY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU
I SET A READING GOAL EVERY NIGHT TOO ITS USUALLY PAGES A NIGHT OR CHAPTERS IN THE BOOK USUALLY WHICH EVER ONE COMES FIRST FOR ME
IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER IS THIS WRONG WHATEVER GETS YOU AND KEEPS YOU READING BOOKS IS A GOOD THING IT'S AMAZING HOW LITTLE PEOPLE TODAY READ BOOKS I KNOW THERE'S STILL A LOT OF US AND IT'S KIND OF A THING TO SAY BUT I KNOW LIKE OTHER PERSON THAT READS AND GROWING UP I WAS THE ONLY KID TO READ IN MY CLASS I EVEN GOT BULLIED OVER IT SORRY FOR GETTING OFF TRACK READINGS IMPORTANT SO WHATEVER KEEPS YOU READING IS A GOOD THING
NUMBER SOMETIMES I DO THAT TO MAKE MYSELF STOP BEFORE STAYING UP ALL NIGHT AND SOMETIMES I DO THAT TO GET ME TO CONTINUE A BOOK THAT I LIKE BUT DO NOT LOVE SOME BOOKS ARE WORK SOME BOOKS ARE TOO MUCH WORK AND SOME BOOKS I JUST SOAK UP LIKE A SPONGE

IF YOU'RE FORCING YOURSELF TO READ WITH PAGE GOALS IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THE RIGHT MATERIAL FOR YOURSELF A GOOD NOVEL WILL OFTEN BE SO GRIPPING THAT YOU SIMPLY CANNOT PUT IT DOWN
THIS IS HOW I READ WHEN I FIRST STARTED A FEW YEARS AGO AT FIRST I SET GOALS OF PAGES A DAY AND I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SIT DOWN AND COMPLETE MY GOALS BUT I CONTINUED DUE TO A DEEPER SENSE OF ENJOYMENT AND SATISFACTION

NOWADAYS I DON'T FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET MYSELF TO READ AND ENJOY IT

IT'S HARD AT FIRST BUT IT GETS MUCH EASIER
WHY WOULD IT BE WRONG AND BY WHO'S SET OF RULES
I'VE BEEN SETTING READING ALLOTMENTS FOR YEARS I LOVE TO READ AND I HAVE LITTLE DIFFICULTY PICKING UP A BOOK EVERY DAY BUT I FOUND IN COLLEGE THAT I WOULD OFTEN READ ONLY A LITTLE BIT AND CALL IT AT THAT BY SETTING AN ALLOTMENT EVERY DAY I ENSURE THAT I SPEND TIME DOING SOMETHING THAT IS VERY MEANINGFUL TO ME ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU FOLLOW YOU PASSIONS IN THIS WAY CAN'T BE BAD
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT I'M A PRETTY AVID READER BOOKS A WEEK AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN DO IT I USUALLY HAVE A GOAL OF PAGES PER SITTING BUT ONCE YOU GET THAT FAR IN YOU SORT OF LOSE TRACK AND KEEP GOING SETTING GOALS IS THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN DOING THIS SETTING A PAGE AS A GOAL SINCE I DID THE IB PROGRAM IN HIGH SCHOOL YEARS AGO AND IT HELPED ME GET THROUGH UNIVERSITY MY PROGRAM WAS ENGLISH AND PSYCHOLOGY AKA A LOT OF READING ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER THINGS GOING ON AROUND ME INCLUDING WORK AND WHATEVER I FIND I GET DISTRACTED QUITE EASILY SO EVEN THOUGH I LOVE READING IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SIT DOWN AND CONCENTRATE THE PAGE CHAPTER GOAL THING HELPS ME PACE MYSELF AND IF I WANT TO KEEP READING I JUST KEEP READING IT'S THE SAME APPROACH I HAVE WITH PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND WATCHING ANIME AND HONESTLY IT'S WHY I CAN'T REALLY BOTHER TO WATCH LENGTHY MOVIES BECAUSE I HATE SITTING FOR SO LONG

AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH DOING WHAT YOU DO TO READ
I AM AN AVID READER I CAN'T GET ENOUGH BUT I STILL MAKE GOALS WHETHER IT BE PAGES BEFORE BED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S REALLY JUST A PERSONAL PREFERENCE THERE'S NO WRONG WAY TO READ
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT BE CAREFUL OF TRYING TO RUSH THROUGH THE LAST FEW PAGES AT TIMES WHEN YOU ARE TIRED ETC BETTER TO BE SHORT OF YOUR GOAL AND FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE READ
IF YOU ARE READING THEN WHO CARES WHY I SAY
I USED TO DO THAT AND I WOULD JUST KEEP PUTTING OFF READING THE BOOK I RECOMMEND NOT HAVING A GOAL EACH READING SESSION AND JUST READ UNTIL YOU FEEL LIKE DOING SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAY YOU REALLY ENJOY THE BOOK AND YOU'RE NOT JUST FORCING YOURSELF TO DO IT BY THE WAY WITH VIDEO GAMES I WAS THE SAME WAY I'D FORCE MYSELF TO UNLOCK ACHIEVEMENTS TROPHIES COLLECTIBLES PER NIGHT I STARTED TO PROCRASTINATE ON MY NIGHTLY GOAL AND WOULD JUST DO SOMETHING ELSE ONCE I STOPPED CARING AND JUST PLAYED AT A LEISURELY PACE I STARTED ENJOYING IT AGAIN
SURELY MY BODY WOULD THANK ME IF I HAD A HARD PAGE LIMIT EACH NIGHT SO I COULD ACTUALLY GET SOME SLEEP INSTEAD OF STAYING UP ALL NIGHT AND THEN WAKING UP ON TOP OF A BOOK OR TABLET
I DID THIS WITH THE A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE SERIES MY GOAL WAS PAGES A DAY AND IS THE REASON I FINISHED BOOK THREE OVER PAGES IN A LITTLE OVER THREE WEEKS NOT ONLY DID THIS GOAL MOVE ME ALONG THROUGH ALL FIVE BOOKS AT A NICE PACE IT ALSO GAVE ME A SMALL SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT I ALMOST NEVER READ ALL PAGES IN ONE SITTING I'D SPREAD IT OUT OVER SESSIONS PER DAY
I DO THAT MYSELF AND IT'S DEFINITELY A GOOD WAY TO GET YOURSELF TO KEEP READING

IT IS ALSO SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE DO SO AS TO NOT OVERDO SOMETHING AND GET TIRED OF IT
INITIALLY I THOUGHT THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF READING BUT THAT'S WONDERFUL IF IT WORKS FOR YOU BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU'LL GET HOOKED AND READ BEYOND YOUR GOAL WITHOUT NOTICING

SOME RECOMMENDED READING

FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON

READY PLAYER ONE

THE BOOK THIEF

THE AUTHOR DAN BROWN NO REALLY HE'S GOOD AT PACING IMHO

THE GIRL WITH ALL THE GIFTS

GOOD LUCK I REALLY THINK READING WILL HELP WITH YOUR ANXIETY I STRUGGLE WITH THAT TOO I'LL ADD MORE SUGGESTIONS IF I THINK OF ANY


NOT SURE YOU'LL READ THIS

HOW ABOUT A LIMIT INSTEAD IF YOU SEE IT AS I'LL READ HOW ABOUT I DO NOT READ PAST
INGEST AND ENJOY WHAT YOU READ ITS FINE TO PASS OR NOT MEET A GOAL HOWEVER YOU SHOULD TREAT THAT AS SPECIAL EITHER WAY
ITS NOT BAD MAN AS LONG AS YOU'RE READING WHAT BOOK IS IT
IF YOU KEEP GOING BOOKS A YEAR THAT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AVERAGE CIRC SO GREAT WORK ALSO SETTING A GOAL FOR READING AND READING IN SMALLER CHUNKS MAKES IT EASIER TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE MATERIAL AND IMPROVES RETENTION
I LIKE TO END AT A PAGE WITH A CLEAN PARAGRAPH BREAK A HARD BREAK OR A NEW PARAGRAPH MORE THAN A SPECIFIC PAGE BUT I THINK IT'S GOOD TO SET GOALS WHILE READING IF YOU STICK TO THEM IT GUARANTEES YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HALF READ THE SAME PAGE THREE TIMES THAN PLAY ON YOUR PHONE AND NEVER END UP READING MUCH OF THE BOOK
ONLY ON REDDIN
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT DEPENDS ON THE BOOK WHILE TRUE IT DEPENDS ON YOUR GOAL EVEN MORE SEEING THAT TO YOU READING IS STILL LIKE EATING YOUR VEGETABLES I'D SAY YOUR STRATEGY IS SOUND

THAT BEING SAID I HOPE YOU CAN GET TO A PLACE ONE DAY WHERE YOU CAN READ FOR PURE ENJOYMENT WITHOUT NEEDING TO SET GOALS LIKE WORKING OUT AND EATING HEALTHY READING IS SOMETHING MANY START AS A CHORE BUT ENDS UP BEING A PLEASURE
I READ IN THE SAUNA AND WILL SORT OF FEEL OUT HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN IN THERE BASED ON HOW MANY PAGES I READ
READING IS NEVER WRONG
I'M THE SAME READING IS WORK AND I HAVE TO PUSH MYSELF LIKE EXERCISE
I'D SAY IT IS ONLY A PROBLEM IF YOU AREN'T HAPPY READING I MEAN SURE YOU CAN FEEL LIKE PUTTING THE BOOK DOWN AND SAYING NO I PROMISED MYSELF I'D KEEP GOING MORE PAGES OR IF ITS NOT YOUR TYPE OF BOOK BUT YOU PROMISED YOURSELF TO EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS A BIT THEN DO IT BUT NUMBER WHAT I MEAN IS IF YOU JUST ARE NOT ENJOYING READING AT ALL THEN YOU SHOULD STOP BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT BE GETTING ANYTHING OUT OF IT OTHER THAN WASTING YOUR TIME

PERSONALLY I STOP ON CHAPTERS IF I CAN BECAUSE I LIKE TO CONCLUDE A NORMAL SEQUENCE OF THINKING AND LOGIC ITS EASIER FOR WHEN I PICK IT UP NEXT TIME BUT THAT'S ME IMMOV
WRONG NUMBER WEIRD MAYBE I ASK THIS BECAUSE WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THE STORY OR THE PAGE NUMBER FOR ME I NEVER HAVE A SET PAGE IN MIND BUT IF I START DRIFTING OFF I LIKE TO HANG ON UNTIL THE END OF THE CHAPTER IF IT HAS CHAPTERS I NEED SOME SORT OF CLOSURE
YES IT IS WRONG IF YOU CONTINUE TO DO THIS I WILL HAVE YOU KILLED
SOON YOU'LL HAVE THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM I'LL JUST FINISH THIS CHAPTER THEN I'LL TURN OFF THE LIGHT OH WHAT'S ONE MORE
AND SUDDENLY IT'S AND YOU HAVE TO GET UP AT
IT'S TOTALLY FINE TO HAVE A GOAL LIKE THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PAGES OR FINISHING A CHAPTER WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU IS RIGHT IF IT GETS YOU READING AND KEEPS YOU READING IT'S GREAT
MY GOAL IS ALWAYS THE OPPOSITE I SET A GOAL LIKE I WILL STOP READING AT AND WHEN ROLLS AROUND I'M LIKE CLOSE ENOUGH
THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE WRONG ARE THOSE THAT HARM OR INFRINGE UPON THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS
NO JUST DO WHATEVER FEELS BEST OP

I FOR ONE JUST READ THE ENTIRE BOOK FROM FINISH TO END WHEN I CAN AND IF I CAN'T I RESUME SOME OTHER TIME AND DON'T REALLY KEEP TRACK OF THE PAGES HAHA JUST WHAT WORKS FOR YOU BOO
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH SETTING GOALS IN MY BOOKS IS THAT I ALWAYS REACH THAT GOAL THEN DON'T WANT TO STOP THERE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH SETTING A GOAL I USED TO USE 2 BOOKMARKS AT ALL TIMES ONE TO MARK WHERE I'M AT AND ONE TO MARK WHERE I WANT TO BE WHEN I STOP READING FOR THE SESSION
NO BUT THEN AGAIN MY PROBLEM WOULD BE THAT I'D PASS THE GOAL EVERY TIME I COULD NOT IMAGINE READING BEING A CHORE EXCEPT FOR MANUALS AND TEXTBOOKS
NUMBER WHATEVER GETS YOU TO READ MORE EVERY SINGLE DAY SHOULD BE PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE
THAT'S HOW I GET THROUGH BOOKS I'M NOT REALLY ENJOYING IF I'M ENJOYING A BOOK I DON'T NEED THESE GOALS I JUST READ THE BOOK
IF IT WORKS FOR YOU IT'S NOT WRONG

I WOULD STRESS MYSELF OUT IF I SET A PAGE GOAL AND I STILL HAD TO DO OTHER STUFF LIKE GET TO AN APPOINTMENT ON TIME THE TIME PRESSURE WOULDN'T WORK FOR ME AT ALL

BUT IF YOU HAVE THE OPPOSITE AND IT'S EASIER FOR YOU TO BE IN THE MOMENT WHEN YOU WORK TOWARDS A PAGE GOAL WHY WOULD THAT BE WRONG
BUDDY THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T LIKE READING I LIKE READING BUT EVEN FOR ME THERE ARE BOOKS WHERE IT'S A STRAIN I SET MYSELF PAGES A DAY AS A MINIMUM SUPER EASY GOAL OF COURSE AND THEN IF I FEEL LIKE READING MORE I CAN AND IF NOT THEN THAT'S FINE I DEFINITELY NEEDED THIS TO GET THROUGH GARDENS OF THE MOON AND DEADHOUSE GATES GREAT BOOKS BUT SUPER EXHAUSTING TO READ BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH INFO STUFFED INTO EACH SENTENCE

BUT YEAH KEEP DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING SET YOURSELF SMALL GOALS AND KEEP READING WHEN YOU FIND BOOKS YOU ENJOY READING YOU'LL GET TO YOUR PRESET GOAL AND THEN YOU CAN JUST KEEP READING IF YOU WANT OR NOT UP TO YOU ONE BOOK AT A TIME
BUT YOU CONCLUDE THAT YOU ENJOY IT RIGHT

IF YOU NEED TO SETUP THOSE GOALS TO GET THINGS YOUR WAY THATS SIMPLY YOUR WAY YOUR ABROACH

IF ITS ABIT DIFFICULT TO GET STARTED YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY AUDIOBOOKS TO ACCESS THE BOOK WORLD
HONESTLY IF SOMETHING HELPS YOU START READING BY ALL MEANS KEEP DOING IT I PERSONALLY HAVE ISSUES WITH MOTIVATION SO READING A BOOK CAN BE AN ARDUOUS TASK EVEN THOUGH I LOVE READING AND IF NOT FOR THE PLETHORA OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA I WOULDN'T STOP READING SO LONG AS YOU'RE ENJOYING YOURSELF AND YOU'RE NOT JUST FORCING YOURSELF TO READ FOR SOME WEIRD REASON THEN KEEP ON SETTING GOALS MY DUDE
DEPENDS ON WHY YOU READ IF YOU WANT TO EDUCATE YOURSELF ON A TOPIC THAT'S DRY TO READ ABOUT THEN SURE FOR ME WHEN I FIND A BOOK THAT'S INTERESTING ENOUGH I CAN JUST KEEP ON READING UNTIL THE END

ANOTHER THING THAT MIGHT HELP WITH YOUR GOALS IS TO GET A KINDLE APP ON YOUR PHONE AND READ WHEN YOU NEED TO KILL SOME TIME
HI AVID GAMER READER MYSELF IF YOU LIKE READING AND IS THE BEST WAY TO HELP YOU BEGIN READING THEN BY ALL MEANS GO FOR IT HOWEVER I MIGHT SUGGEST ONE TECHNIQUE THAT HELPS ME CONVINCE MYSELF TO LIFT UP THE BOOK AND BEGIN READING

EVERY FEW PAGES WHENEVER SOMETHING INTRIGUING OR THOUGHT PROVOKING COMES ACROSS IN THE BOOK PAUSE TAKE A MINUTE TO THINK DEEPLY HYPOTHESIZE AND TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF THE INTRIGUING POINT IN THE STORY

THIS MIGHT HELP YOU IT HELPED ME GET MORE MENTALLY INVESTED IN THE BOOK IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE STORY AND BE MORE EAGER TO COME BACK TO THE BOOK NEXT TIME


I DON'T THINK IT'S WRONG WHATEVER GETS YOU TO READ MORE WORKS AND SOMETIMES FUN THINGS FEEL LIKE CHORES AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT READING IS TO ME

I SET GOALS AS WELL AS MUCH AS I LOVE READING IT DOES TAKE SOME DISCIPLINE TO GET ME TO ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND READ FOR A TIME BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS I LIKE TO DO AS WELL THE INTERNET FOR ONE IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE SO WHAT I DO IS SET A TIME LIMIT FOR MYSELF I WOULD READ FOR HALF AN HOUR EACH TIME AFTER EVERY MEAL THAT WOULD ADD UP TO TWO HOURS PER DAY OF READING ONE HOUR IF I HAVE WORK ON THAT DAY

AND THEN AFTER EACH READING SESSION I REWARD MYSELF WITH GAMING OR SURFING THE INTERNET
THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO START READING I GREW UP IN A HOUSE WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE A TV GROWING UP AND WE WERE HOMESCHOOLED USING A READING BASED CURRICULUM AND EACH DAY WE WERE REQUIRED TO READ X AMOUNT OF PAGES FROM VARIOUS SUBJECTS BY 4TH GRADE EACH OF US KIDS WERE READING AT A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND BY MY FRESHMEN YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL I HAD A READING COMPREHENSION LEVEL OF SOMEONE GETTING THEIR DOCTORATE
EVEN NOW THAT I'M I'D RATHER CURL UP WITH A BOOK THAN SIT AND WATCH TV AND ON A DAY OFF I CAN READ PAGE BOOKS OVER THE COURSE OF HOURS
SO PLEASE NEVER GET DISCOURAGED MAKE A GOAL FOR YOURSELF AND STICK TO IT
I DON'T THINK SO IF IT MOTIVES YOU TO READ IT WORKS
WHENEVER I READ A BOOK I FORCE MYSELF TO NOT LOOK AT THE PAGE NUMBER SO THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR I HAVE GOTTEN UNTIL I FINISH READING IN THAT SESSION I ALSO NEVER WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH TIME IS LEFT IN A MOVIE OR TV SHOW
MY HUSBAND JUST PICKED UP READING FOR PLEASURE ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO AND HAS READ NEARLY EVERYTHING STEPHEN KING HAS EVER WRITTEN BY DOING THIS KEEP IT UP
LAST BOOK I READ I ALWAYS TRIED TO END ON A AT THE END OF THE PAGE NUMBER BUT IT ALSO HAD TO BE THE END START OF A CHAPTER SO I KNEW WHERE I WAS

IF IT HELPS YOU READ THEN DO IT READING IS EXCELLENT AND IF YOU CAN FIND WAYS TO ENJOY IT OR MAKE IT EASIER THEN BY ALL MEANS
WATCH HOW IT FEELS IF YOU DO IT IF IT FEELS HARD BUT EVENTUALLY GOOD AND BRINGS GOOD THINGS TO YOUR LIFE YOU'RE PROBABLY ON THE RIGHT TRACK IF YOU MOTIVATE YOURSELF VIA SHAME A GOAL LIKE THAT MIGHT BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BUT THERE'S NO WAY IT CAN BE SIMPLY RIGHT OR WRONG IT EITHER WORKS FOR YOU OR DOESN'T THAT'S LIFE AS WE KNOW IT PAL LEARN YOURSELF NOBODY ELSE CAN TEACH YOU WHO YOU ARE
I STARTED BY READING A CHAPTER A DAY OF THE OZ BOOKS BACK IN NO MORE NO LESS ODD YEARS LATER I HAVE READ PROBABLY AROUND BOOKS I READ AT A TIME

THERE IS NO WRONG WAY TO START READING
I NEVER TRY TO GET TO A PAGE NUMBER I SET A TIMER FOR MINS AND I READ UNTIL THE TIMER GOES OFF I FALL ASLEEP OR I FIND I'M READING THE SAME WORDS OVER AND OVER THAT'S IT
I TEND TO SHIFT MY BOOKMARK TO MY NEXT READING GOAL NEXT CHAPTER ETC THEN TRY TO READ TILL THERE

HOWEVER I TRY TO TREAT IT AS A GUIDELINE RATHER THAN AN ABSOLUTE GOAL SO OCCASIONALLY I MIGHT STOP EARLIER IF I DON'T FEEL UP FOR IT OR IF THE SECTION IS A LITTLE HARDER TO READ LARGELY WITH USUALLY I STOP AT THE TARGET OR KEEP READING ON IF I AM REALLY ENJOYING IT

WITH FICTION I USUALLY STOP READING EITHER WHEN THE BOOK IS OVER OR WHEN I SEE SUNLIGHT COMING THROUGH MY WINDOW WHICH IS WHEN I REALIZE THAT I READ ALL NIGHT AND FORGOT TO SLEEP
I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM I DO THIS REGULARLY WITH SCHOOL TEXTS THAT I DON'T WANT TO READ BUT HAVE TO I'LL SET A GOAL OF TEN PAGES OR ONE CHAPTER THEN GIVE MYSELF A REWARD OR BREAK I DO THE OPPOSITE WITH PLEASURE READING ONLY TEN MORE PAGES OR ONE MORE CHAPTER THEN BED HAVING CLEAR GOALS AND LIMITS IS A GOOD IDEA AND I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE FULFILLING ALL YOUR OBLIGATIONS
I HAVE TERRIBLE READING HABITS NOW SO I'M PROBABLY THE WORST PERSON TO ADVISE BUT I'D SAY THAT THERE'S NO WRONG WAY TO READ AND WHATEVER IT IS THAT MAKES IT WORK FOR YOU DO IT WHEN I WAS AT UNI I WOULD EITHER AIM FOR PAGES A DAY IF I HAD LONG ENOUGH TO READ THE BOOK AT THAT PACE OR SPLIT THE PAGE COUNT BY THE NUMBER OF DAYS I HAD AND AIM FOR THAT
IF THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE READ FOR PLEASURE IN A WHILE IT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT IDEA TO BUILD YOUR STAMINA READING FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IS SOMETHING YOH HAVE TO BUILD UP TO AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT RACING AHEAD JUST TO GET TO YOUR PAGE YOU COULD TRY USING TIME AS A MEASUREMENT INSTEAD

IF YOU LOVE SETTING GOALS FOR YOURSELF TRY THE GOODREADS APPARENTLY IT LETS YOU SEE THE PERCENTAGE OF WHAT YOU'VE READ LISTS THE BOOKS YOU'VE READ OR WANT TO READ AND YOU CAN SET A YEARLY CHALLENGE TOO
I HOPE THIS HELPS WITH MORE THAN JUST SETTING PAGE GOALS

ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WORKED AT A PUBLISHER OF TEXTBOOKS AND WHAT NOT WHILE TEXTBOOKS CERTAINLY AREN'T NOVELS EVERYONE WHO WORKED THERE WAS VERY WELL-READ I WAS TALKING ABOUT MOBY DICK AND HOW IT'S A GREAT BOOK BUT SOMETIMES CERTAIN CHAPTERS THAT AREN'T RELATED TO THE PLOT CAN REALLY DRAG ON AND THE GUY I WAS TALKING TO SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY PROFOUND TO ME AT THE TIME HE SAID IT'S YOUR BOOK READ IT HOW YOU WANT SKIP CHAPTERS GO BACK AND SECTIONS IT'S MY READING EXPERIENCE AND THERE'S NO ONE WAY TO READ A BOOK

TL R WHATEVER MAXIMIZES YOU'RE ENJOYMENT OF A BOOK IS THE BEST WAY TO READ IT
WHAT WORKS BEST FOR ME IS READING A CHAPTER EACH NIGHT BY THE TIME I FINISH THE CHAPTER MY EYES HAVE BEGAN TO GET HEAVY AND ALLOWS ME TO FALL ASLEEP MUCH FASTER IT'S KINDA NICE

I ALSO ALWAYS CARRY MY BOOK EVERYWHERE I GO IF I FIND A MOMENT WHERE I CAN READ A FEW PAGES THEN I OPEN THAT SUCKER UP
ALSO THIS IS GOOD BECAUSE I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I WAS IN PUBLIC AND SOMEONE SAW THE BOOK I WAS READING AND EITHER ASKED ME IF IT WAS GOOD OR STARTED A SMALL CONVERSATION ABOUT THE BOOK IT ALSO LETS ME INSPIRE OTHERS TO BEGIN READING PEOPLE DON'T TYPICALLY SEE ME AS THE TYPE TO READ BUT ONCE THEY START TALKING TO ME THEY'RE USUALLY LIKE WOW YOU'RE REALLY SMART
YEAH EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT I USE A KINDLE SO FOR ME I SHOOT FOR PERCENTAGES I TRY TO GET TO MORE EVERYTIME I SIT DOWN TO READ
WRONG NOPE

I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT SORTS OF GOALS

THE STOP READING GOAL USUALLY THIS IS WHEN I'M READING DURING LUNCH TIME I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK I KNOW I DO BUT THE BOOK IS SO GOOD SO I GIVE MYSELF A OK YOU HAVE TO STOP AFTER THE END OF THIS CHAPTER GOAL

THE YOU CAN STOP READING GOAL USUALLY THIS IS WHEN I'M REALLY TIRED BUT I DON'T WANT TO STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING SO I GIVE MYSELF A YOU CAN STOP READING AT THE END OF THIS PARAGRAPH GOAL
YES IT CAN TOTALLY HELP MOTIVATE YOU AND MAKE YOU READ MORE BECAUSE YOUR GOALS ARE TANGIBLE
I LIKE TO HAVE A MINI CELEBRATION IN MY HEAD WHEN I GET TO SIGNIFICANTLY NUMBERED PAGES LIKE OR IT GIVES ME A NICE SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT
IT'S A BOOK THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH READING LO
I READ UNDER THE DOME IN UNDER TWO WEEKS BECAUSE I SET THIS EXACT GOAL FOR MYSELF I ENJOYED THE RIGID SCHEDULE A LOT MORE THAN JUST READING BITS AND PIECES WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT SINCE I NEVER FINISH THE BOOK THAT WAY
HAVE TO READ YOU SHOULD READ FOR PLEASURE IF YOU ARE READING AS AN EXERCISE WHAT IS THE POINT I FEEL LIKE YOU'D RUSH THROUGH AND NOT REALLY BECOME FULLY IMMERSED JUST SO THAT YOU CAN REACH THE ARBITRARY GOAL
WHEN I PICK UP A BOOK THAT SEEMS DRY AT PARTS I FLIP TO A PART THAT SEEMS MILDLY INTERESTING AND STICK A BOOK MARK IN IT THAT KEEPS ME MOTIVATED TO KEEP READING BECAUSE I SEE AN END GOAL WITH A PAY-OFF I'M AN ENGLISH MAJOR AND THIS HELPS A LOT WHEN I HAVE TO READ A BOOK THAT DOESN'T SEEM INTERESTING TO ME FOR CLASSES
NO IF I PICK UP A BOOK I WILL NOT PEE OR EAT AFTER I HAVE AN UNHEALTHY HABIT OF BEING ABLE TO PUT ASIDE LIFE IF I AM ENGROSSED IN A BOOK SO I SET GOALS MORE LIKE LIMITATIONS ON A CERTAIN NUMBER I NEED TO TAKE A HUMAN BREAK IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY DISGUSTING DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU BECAUSE READING IS POWER
I JUST STARTED THIS TODAY I WASN'T READING THROUGH MY SERIES AS FAST AS I'D LIKE TO I SET A PAGE GOAL TO FINISH MY CURRENT BOOK BY THE END OF THE WEEK THEY HAVE BEEN HELPFUL IN THE PAST
I OFTEN FLIP AHEAD THROUGH THE PAGES UNTIL I EITHER COME ACROSS A NEW CHAPTER OR A PAGE BREAK WHERE I THINK I MIGHT WANT TO STOP I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I'M IN FOR BEFORE I DIVE IN
FIND A PATH TO GOOD BOOKS AT YOUR LEVEL AND YOU WON'T NEED ANY PAGE BY PAGE GOAL FOR MOTIVATION
I USUALLY READ ONE CHAPTER WHEN I READ IF IT'S PAGES SO BE IT IF IT'S SO BE IT BUT I MIGHT BREAK UP A LONG CHAPTER ACROSS MULTIPLE SITTINGS IN ONE DAY AND SOMETIMES IF I READ A SHORT CHAPTER I'LL READ ANOTHER CHAPTER TOO
NUMBER PERSONALLY WHEN READING A BOOK I ALWAYS TRY TO READ THE ENTIRE CHAPTER IF THE CHAPTER IS DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS THEN I TRY TO COMPLETE THE SECTION BEFORE CONTINUING NEXT TIME
NUMBER PERSONALLY WHEN READING A BOOK I ALWAYS TRY TO READ THE ENTIRE CHAPTER IF THE CHAPTER IS DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS THEN I TRY TO COMPLETE THE SECTION BEFORE CONTINUING NEXT TIME
I GENERALLY TRY TO GET TO THE NEXT CHAPTER WHEN I READ WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A GOAL OF GETTING TO A CERTAIN PAGE
I USED TO WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BUT NOW I USUALLY READ UNTIL THE END OF THE CHAPTER OR HAVE TO STOP IF IT'S A GOOD BOOK OR JUST STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF A PAGE IF IT'S A BORING BOOK
I WOULD SAY NO IT'S NOT WRONG AT ALL BECAUSE MAYBE THE REAL PURPOSE OF READING COULD RESULT AS A BYPRODUCT BUT I DON'T LIKE SUCH STIFF GOALS BECAUSE WHAT IF YOU LEAVE OFF IN SOME SERIOUS ACTION

I THINK IT MIGHT BE MORE WORTH YOUR WHILE TO ENGAGE THE MATERIAL LIKE SUMMARIZE WHAT YOU'VE READ IN YOUR SESSION OR DO SO BACK TO A FRIEND OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER OR KEEP THOSE NEW DETAILS FRESH AND LINK THEM BACK TO PREVIOUS TEXT LIKE THIS CHAPTER HAD A LOT OF GREGOROVICH AND WHAT ELSE HAVE I READ ABOUT OH RIGHT THERE'S OLLIVANDER AND THIS GREGOROVICH OH RIGHT HE MAKES WANDS FOR DURMSTRANG AND SHIT YEA THAT'S WHERE IGOR AND KRUM COME FROM AND ETC ETC

OR JUST CREATE A VISUAL SUMMARY AORTA LIVE THROUGH IT WHATEVER

I WAS NEVER A READER EITHER BUT EVENTUALLY I GOT OVER THE NUMBERS OF IT PAGES HOW MANY BOOKS ETC AND STARTED TAKING IN MORE
I THINK IT IS MUCH BETTER TO SET TIME LIMITS THAN PAGE LIMITS YOU NEVER WANT TO BE READING JUST TO GET THROUGH IT AS THEN YOU DON'T ABSORB IT IT IS BETTER TO READ ONE PAGE AND REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS BEING SAID AND EVEN GO BACK OVER IT THAN PAGES JUST TO FULFILL A COMMITMENT
I DO THE SAME THING EXCEPT I TRY READ ATLEAST ONE CHAPTER EVERY SITTING WHATEVER WORKS BUD KEEP AT IT AND ENJOY
I WON'T READ IF I'M NOT CONFIDENT I HAVE TIME FOR AT LEAST A WHOLE CHAPTER
YES YOUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO LEARN OR ENJOY OR BOTH AN ARBITRARY PAGE COUNT IS VIRTUALLY USELESS
IT'S NOT WRONG AS LONG AS THERE'S STILL READING COMPREHENSION AND YOUR BRAIN IS ABSORBING THE STORY I DO ADMIT THAT SOMETIMES MY BRAIN DRIFTS WHILE READING AND I HAVE TO GO BACK A PAGE OR TWO TO GET BACK ON TRACK
I USUALLY GO FOR READING THE FULL BOOK IF IT ISN'T EXTREMELY LONG
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE I ALWAYS END ON PALINDROMIC PAGE NUMBERS THERE ARE A FEW EXCEPTIONS MULTIPLES OF OR SHOULDN'T BE STOPPED ON EITHER THE EXACT RULES DO VARY A BIT BASED ON ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF THE PAGE NUMBER
IF YOU HAVE AN IPHONE YOU MIGHT ENJOY THE BOOKLING APP

BOOKLING
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT FOR ME I JUST READ UNTIL I GET TO WHAT I FEEL IS A GOOD STOPPING POINT SOMETIMES IT'S PAGES SOMETIMES IT'S IF IT FEELS LIKE MORE OF A CHORE TO YOU THEN IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP TO A SCHEDULE UNTIL YOU GET MORE COMFORTABLE WITH IT AND CAN PICK UP A BOOK WITHOUT FEELING LIKE YOU HAVE TO READ THIS MUCH BEFORE YOU CAN PUT IT DOWN
DOES IT WORK FOR YOU

THEN NO IT'S NOT WRONG DON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU OTHERWISE
I USUALLY PICK A PAGE NUMBER SO THAT I DON'T END UP READING UNTIL A MASCULINE
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE DOING FINE I WOULD TRY DIFFERENT GENRES TO SEE IF SOMETHING REALLY CLICKS FOR YOU IF YOU FIND SOMETHING YOU'RE REALLY INTO THAT SHOULD HELP YOU GO THROUGH IT A LITTLE FASTER BOOKS THAT I'M NOT REALLY INTO REALLY DRAG FOR ME
READING ATLEAST A CHAPTER IN ONE SITTING IS WHAT I AIM FOR AS I CAN TAKE IN THE STORY AS THE AUTHOR INTENDED AND GET THE FULL EFFECT

IF I FIND MYSELF FORCING MYSELF TO READ A PARTICULAR BOOK TOO OFTEN THEN I JUST DROP IT BECAUSE THAT MEANS I'M NOT VERY INTERESTED IN IT DON'T GIVE UP BEFORE PAGE OR SO THOUGH AS THAT'S WHERE I'VE FOUND MANY BOOKS HIT THEIR STRIDE
PERSONALLY IM VERY EXTREME WITH READING I EITHER GO ALL OUT READING BOOKS A WEEK OR I DONT PICK UP A BOOK FOR MONTHS
WHAT REALLY HELPED ME WAS FINDING A GENRE THAT I REALLY ENJOY AND THEN I OFTEN STRUGGLE TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN
WHERE I DO STRUGGLE TO GET INTO A BOOK BUT DONT WANT TO LEAVE IT AND GO TO SOMETHING ELSE I TEND TO SET CHAPTERS AS MY GOAL USUALLY CHAPTERS PER SITTING SO THAT I FEEL LIKE IM STILL PROGRESSING THROUGH THE BOOK
THIS IS WHY I ENJOY BOOKS THAT HAVE RELATIVELY SHORT CHAPTERS CHAPTERS ARE A GOOD STOPPING POINT IN MY OPINION

UNLESS YOU'RE READING JAMES PATTERSON HIS CHAPTERS ARE RIDICULOUSLY SHORT
THE MOST OF A GOAL I'VE EVER HAD WAS FINISHING THIS CHAPTER SO I CAN GET TO SLEEP AT A REASONABLE HOUR
I DON'T SET GOALS BUT FIND MYSELF ANNOYED AT BOOKS WITHOUT PERIODIC BREAKS I UNDERSTAND RAINBOW IS SUPPOSED TO BE DENSE BUT I PREFER BOOKS LIKE CAT'S CRADLE BECAUSE THERE ARE OOOO MANY SHORT CHAPTERS
HONESTLY IT'S SOMETHING I'VE TRIED TO AVOID DOING ONLY BECAUSE FOR ME PERSONALLY HAVING ARBITRARY GOALS LIKE THAT CAN HAVE YOU FOCUSING ON COMPLETING THEM MORE THAN ACTUALLY ENJOYING THE STORY AND I FIND MYSELF MISSING DETAILS HERE AND THERE OR LESS APPRECIATIVE OF MORE SUBTLE ARCS
MY GOAL IS TO READ THE BOOK
I READ UNTIL THE PAGE NUMBER CAN BE DIVIDE WITH OR UNTIL THE END OF A CHAPTER
LET ME PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE LOTS OF PEOPLE HERE ARE SAYING THAT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HAVING GOALS BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE SOMETHING I LEARNED IN MOTIVATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY IS THAT EXTERNAL MOTIVATIONS LIKE COMPLETING A GOAL REDUCE THE POTENCY OF INTERNAL MOTIVATOR LIKE ENJOYMENT THIS IS WHY GETTING PAID FOR A HOBBY TURNS IT INTO A JOB YOU ARE GETTING AN EXTERNAL REINFORCER IN THE FORM OF MONEY SO YOUR INTERNAL REINFORCER IS LESS POWERFUL OF COURSE I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU GOALS ATE POWERFUL AND CAN REALLY HELPFUL YOU GET STUFF DONE BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THEM IF YOU'RE TRYING TO READ FOR FUN BECAUSE THEY'LL SUCK THE FUN RIGHT OUT
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT I USUALLY TRY TO FINISH THE CURRENT CHAPTER BEFORE I PUT A BOOK DOWN
AS LONG AS YOUR ENJOYING READING IF YOU'RE NOT THEN REMEMBER THAT LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO READ BAD BOOKS

AND REMEMBER THE LIBRARY HAS FREE BOOKS
IT'S NOT ONLY WRONG IT'S ILLEGAL

YOU SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND HAVE THE BOOK THROWN AT YOU
I AM A TERRIBLE READER THE FOLLOWING WORKED FOR ME I NOW READ ON AVERAGE BOOK PER WEEK ONLY BUY BOOKS WITH TOPICS YOU REALLY LIKE 2 ALSO BUY AUDIBOOK READ THE BOOK AND LISTEN TO THE AUDIOBOOK AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE BOOK STOP READING
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A GREAT WAY TO DIMINISH YOUR ENJOYMENT READ UNTIL YOU ARE TIRED OR NEED A BREAK OR MUST GET TO SLEEP READ UNTIL A NATURAL BREAKING POINT WHY PUSH YOURSELF
I DON'T PERSONALLY HAVE THAT ISSUE IF I READ A BOOK AND IT GRASPS ME I USUALLY LOSE MYSELF AND NEXT THING I KNOW I'VE READ PAGES HOWEVER THERE IS NEVER A WRONG WAY TO MOTIVATE YOURSELF TO READ A BOOK AND IF SETTING PAGE GOALS WORKS FOR YOU THEN YOU KEEP DOING IT
I DO THAT WITH CHAPTERS I READ A BUNCH OF BOOKS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF OR AND DID IT BY DIVVYING UP THE BOOKS INTO I HAVE TO READ THIS MANY CHAPTERS TO FINISH IT IN A WEEK I USUALLY DON'T READ THAT FAST BECAUSE I GET KIND OF BORED OF IT BUT HAVING A GOAL MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR ME
LIKE I DON'T ENJOY VIDEO GAMES WHERE EVERYTHING IS ALREADY UNLOCKED FOR YOU BUT I'LL GRIND AWAY FOR WEEKS TRYING TO GET SOME WEAPON OR SKIN THAT'S UNLOCKED FOR DOING X OR GETTING TO Y RANK

SO YOU'RE THE REASON THEY KEEP MAKING UNNECESSARY GRINDS IN GAMES THAT DON'T NEED THEM
ONE MORE PAGE PAST A PREDETERMINED PAGE NUMBER IS THE BEGINNING OF MANY FINISHED BOOKS

READING IS LIME WORKING OUT THE HARDEST PART IS GETTING STARTED AS LONG AS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU'RE READING YOU MIGHT BECOME SO ENGROSSED IN WHAT YOU READ IN PAGES YOU END UP READING MORE
I'VE BEEN READING FOR FUN SINCE AROUND THE AGE OF SEVEN MOST NIGHTS I SIT DOWN TO READ WITH A GOAL IN MIND SOMETIMES I WANT TO READ PAGES A DAY OTHER TIMES I DECIDE I WILL READ FOR AN HOUR SOMETIMES I'LL HAVE BOOK SPECIFIC GOALS SUCH AS TO FINISH IT OR TO FINISH A CHAPTER BUT BASICALLY I ALWAYS HAVE A GOAL I ENJOY GOALS THEY ADD A DIMENSION OF ACHIEVEMENT TO THE JOY OF READING

SO IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION NO IT'S NOT WRONG TO HAVE A GOAL
THE GOODREADS APP IS AMAZING AND WILL HELP YOU IN TWO WAYS YOU CAN KEEP LISTS OF BOOKS YOU HAVE READ AND WANT TO READ AND IT WILL OFFER SUGGESTIONS 2 YOU CAN SET A READING GOAL EACH YEAR AND TRACK IT

I'VE READ ALMOST BOOKS THIS YEAR AND GOODREADS HAS A LOT TO DO WITH ME GETTING BACK INTO READING FOR ENJOYMENT
I'M TERRIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO SITTING DOWN AND READING A BOOK I LOVE EM BUT I HATE JUST SITTING THERE I TURNED INSTEAD TO AUDIO BOOKS I'VE LISTENED TO SINCE JULY I LISTENED WHILE I WORKED CLEANED WALKED DROVE A PAIR OF BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES AND A LIBRARY CARD ARE MY BEAST FRIENDS NOW GIVE IT A TRY
I LOVE READING BUT I HAVE TO SET GOALS FOR MYSELF OR IT'LL TAKE ME FOREVER TO FINISH BOOKS ESPECIALLY LONG ONES I USUALLY DIVIDE THE NUMBER OF PAGES BY THE AMOUNT OF DAYS I WANT TO FINISH IT IN SO I CAN SAY TO MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE IT'LL TAKE ME A MONTH TO FINISH THIS BOOK IF I READ ONLY PAGES A DAY IT'S THE ONLY TO GET THROUGH AUTHORS LIKE LEO TOLSTOY OR VICTOR HUGO THESE AUTHORS HAVE BOOKS THAT ARE INCREDIBLE AS A WHOLE BUT YOU OFTEN HAVE TO SLOG THROUGH PAGES OF BORING BITS TO GET TO THE GOOD STUFF
I READ A CHAPTER AT A TIME IF I'M TOO ENGROSSED AFTER ONE CHAPTER AND I HAVE TIME I READ 2
YES YOU HAVE SOME NERVE READING IN THAT MANNER STOP DOING THAT IMMEDIATELY YOU SON OF A BITCH
I USED TO BE A HEAVY READER I'D READ PAGES WITHOUT BLINKING GOT OUT OF IT FOR CLOSE TO YEARS I READ HERE AND THERE BUT NOT CONTINUOUSLY I'VE BEEN GOOD FOR THE PAST YEAR OR SO BUT I STILL HAVE TO FORCE MYSELF TO READ AT LEAST PAGES A NIGHT EVEN IF I'M ENJOYING THE BOOK I STILL HAVE THE COUNTDOWN IN MY HEAD
IT IS WRONG YOU SHOULD NOT BE DOING IT IT MAKES READING FEEL FORCED

WHAT ARE YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT NO ONE SHOULD TELL YOU HOW TO READ YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT
YES ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DO THIS
NOTHING YOU DO THAT FEELS COMFORTABLE TO YOU IS WRONG AS LONG AS YOU DON'T TRY AND IMPOSE IT ON OTHERS
SOMETIMES I WILL CHECK THE CHAPTER LENGTHS IN THE FRONT OF THE BOOK TO SEE HOW FAR I EXPECT TO GO I MAY STOP EARLIER OR I MAY GO PAST THAT

REALLY JUST DO WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU PERSONALLY I OFTEN JUST READ UNTIL I GET TIRED
I LOVE TO READ AND I STILL DO THE SAME THING IT GETS ME THROUGH DENSER MORE BORING BOOKS
IT IS ABSOLUTELY FUCKING WRONG
ABSOLUTELY NOT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS READ FOR ALL OF HIS LIFE AND ENJOYS IT SOMETIMES YOU NEED A LITTLE MOTIVATION EVEN BEING AN AVID READER THE OKAY LET'S GET TO PAGE BY TOMORROW TURNS INTO OKAY LET'S FINISH THIS BOOK BY THE END OF THE WEEK OR LET'S GET THROUGH THIS SERIES WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS

WHATEVER HELPS
HOW DARE YOU
NUMBER I ALWAYS TRY TO FINISH THE CHAPTER BEFORE STOPPING I HATE STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE
FIND YOUR BOOK AND IT MAKES READING A LOT EASIER ONCE YOU FIND A BOOK YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN IT MAKES READING A LOT MORE ENJOYABLE
I HAVE THE EXACT SAME THING AS THIS

OP ARE YOU DYSLEXIC BY ANY CHANCE
WELL YOU CAN'T CALL IT WRONG NOT IF IT HELPS YOU TO NUDGE YOURSELF TO READ THOUGH IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO DO IT BY CHAPTERS HOPEFULLY YOU'LL START GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THE STORY AND JUST KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU LOOK UP IN SURPRISE AND DISCOVER THAT HOURS HAVE PASSED UNNOTICED THAT'S YOUR REAL GOAL
GOALS ARE BAD IN GENERAL THEY ENCOURAGE SOME SORT OF BEHAVIOR AND USUALLY TREND TOWARDS SUCCESS
I TEND TO READ WHEN I HAVE TIME IN THE EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS IT'S MUCH HARDER WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS PETS AND A HOUSE TO MAINTAIN SO IT BECOMES MORE PRECIOUS AND ENJOYABLE OVER TIME
IT BECOMES A HABIT OF A LIFETIME SO DON'T PUNISH YOURSELF WITH BAD BOOKS
SOME OF MY FAVORITES I DO READ OVER AND OVER AND I HAVE A COUPLE THAT I ALWAYS TAKE ON LONG TRIPS TEND TO BE A BIT INVOLVED SO THEY SUCK UP LARGE AMOUNTS OF TIME ON THE PLANE

TOO SHORT FOR CRAPPY BOOKS SO USE YOUR LIBRARY FIND YOUR FAVOURITE AUTHORS AND FAVOURITE BOOKS
I'VE ENJOYED HAVING A KINDLE TO FIND NEW BOOKS OR GET COPIES OF EXISTING HEAVY TOMES THAT AREN'T PRACTICAL TO CARRY AROUND
IT ALSO MAKES IT EASY TO RETURN SOMEONE RUELY AWFUL
IT'S PERFECTLY FINE IF I'M READING A DIFFICULT BOOK OR A BORING BOOK I DO MAKE THOSE GOALS AND YOU MIGHT FIND THAT YOU'LL KEEP THESE GOALS OF READING ONLY TO A CERTAIN PAGE BUT IN THE REVERSE YOU'LL ONLY READ PAGES BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'LL JUST STAY THERE FOREVER THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU'RE READING NO MATTER WHAT
I DO IT TOO I DON'T EVEN REALIZE I DO IT HAHA SOMETIMES I CARE AND SOMETIMES I DON'T ALL IN ALL I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS UNLESS IT CAUSES SOME KIND OF STRESS IF IT DOES JUST BE LENIENT WITH YOURSELF WHEN YOU CATCH IT HAPPENING I THINK I DO IT MOSTLY BECAUSE I AM A SLOW READER I SIMPLY THINK ABOUT THE TEXT AND THE AUTHOR AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER INFORMATION SOMETIMES I HAVE TO MAKE MYSELF JUST READ THE PAGES AND CARRY ON
I'M THE SAME AND I DON'T ALWAYS FEEL LIKE READING NOVELS THEY TAKE FOREVER SO SOMETIMES I PREFER SHORT STORIES ESSAYS OR POETRY DO WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU
MY GOAL IS ALWAYS PAGES IF I GET IMMERSED IN THE STORY I CAN GO ON FOR HUNDREDS OF PAGES
I DO THE EXACT SAME THING WHEN I READ DEPENDING ON MY SCHEDULE I'LL SET A GOAL OF OR PAGES OR A CHAPTER A DAY WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU
READING WAS ALWAYS MY ESCAPE LIKE WATCHING A GOOD MOVIE SO I NEVER HAD TO DO ANYTHING TO ENCOURAGE MYSELF IF ANYTHING PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE LIMITED MYSELF SO I COULD LEARN SOCIAL SKILLS OR SOMETHING

WELL I WAS LIKE THAT UNTIL I FOUND THE AUTHORS GENRE OF BOOKS THAT I LIKE NOW I ONLY READ THE AUTHORS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE ME WANT TO KEEP TURNING THE PAGES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE A LULL IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRILOGY OF BOOKS THAT I'M OTHERWISE ENTHRALLED BY EAST G THE SOUTHERN REACH TRILOGY I SIMPLY REFUSE TO READ BOOKS THAT DON'T GRAB ME AND KEEP ME WANTING MORE AND MORE CHAPTERS UNTIL THE END
THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO START YOU SHOULD READ FROM DIFFERENT AUTHORS AND FIND WHICH AUTHORS STYLE OF WRITING YOU ENJOY MORE THAN OTHERS I'VE READ ALOT OF DEAN KOONTZ BUT I CAN PUT HIS BOOKS DOWN FAIRLY EASILY MICHAEL CRICHTON STEPHEN KING AND HIS SON JOE HILL WRITE VERY WELL WHEN I START READING BOOKS FROM THEM I DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM DOWN I FOUND MYSELF PAUSING MY VIDEO GAMES JUST TO READ ANOTHER CHAPTER IN BETWEEN PLAY CHUCK PALAHNIUK THE WRITER OF FIGHT CLUB IS ALSO A WRITER WORTH LOOKING INTO WHEN YOU FIND WRITERS THAT SPEAK TO YOU YOU WILL KNOW BY LOOSING TRACK OF TIME WHILE READING GOOD LUCK
DISAGREE WITH THE CONSENSUS AVOID MAKING CHORES OUT OF RECREATION WHENEVER YOU CAN WHO WANTS TO DO CHORES THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
YES IT'S WRONG AND YOU'RE A BAD PERSON
IF IT WORKS DO IT I GUESS BUT IT MAKES ME UPSET TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE YOUR WAY MAKES READING SOUND LIKE A CHORE I THINK PERHAPS THAT YOUR MINDSET IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED I USED TO FEEL LIKE YOU WHEN I WAS A KID THEN I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT BOOKS ARE A SOURCE OF CHEAP RELIABLE ENTERTAINMENT IN EVERY GENRE IMAGINABLE WHICH I CAN TAKE WITH ME VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE

THE FACT THAT BOOKS ARE SUPPOSEDLY ENRICHING IS A SIDE EFFECT WHICH MEANS NOTHING TO ME I READ A BOOK A WEEK AN HOUR OR TWO A DAY AND IT'S BRILLIANT AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY ONLY EVER BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED AND FUCK GAINING ANYTHING OUT OF IT I MEAN I JUST READ TWILIGHT AND ENJOYED IT NO GUILT NOBODY EVEN KNOWS BUT ME I'M AN ADULT WITH A GRADUATE DEGREE A REAL JOB AND FAMILY I COME HOME AND CAN LITERALLY IMMERSE MYSELF IN ANY WORLD I CHOOSE

TL R MAKE SURE YOU'RE READING FOR ENJOYMENT BOOKS ARE LIKE NEVER-ENDING NETFLIX BUT JUST LIKE WAY WAY BETTER
IN THE BIBLE NAHUM I FIND IT EASIER TO READ IN CHUNKS IF I'M READING A GOOD BOOK I MAKE IT A GOAL TO GET THROUGH X AMOUNT OF PAGES A DAY
I DO THE SAME EXACT THING
I THINK WHAT'S BETTER IS TO HAVE A TIME LIMIT INSTEAD OF A PAGE LIMIT NOT READING AS MUCH AS YOU WANT IN SAY MINUTES MIGHT FRUSTRATE YOU AND PUSH YOU TO READ MORE PAGES NEXT TIME OR GO BEYOND MINUTES
I LOVE READING AND I STILL DO IT I HAVE A PROBLEM WHERE I OVER ANALYZE THE TEXT AND GET LOST IN THOUGHT AND IF I LET IT RUN I'D NEVER FINISH A BOOK I DEFINITELY SET GOALS
I DO THE SAME THING OFTEN OR I SET A MINIMUM TIME

RECENTLY I'VE GOT INTO AUDIOBOOKS AND THAT LETS ME HEAR A LOT MORE BOOKS I CAN LISTEN ON THE WAY TO WORK ETC

I ALSO USE TO TRACK WHICH BOOKS IVE FINISHED HOW LONG IT TOOK ME START AND END DATE AS WELL AS WHICH BOOKS I PLAN ON READING THIS HELPS MOTIVATE ME A LOT
YES DOES THIS SEEM LIKE A BAD ANSWER THEN DON'T LISTEN TO IT
I HAVE A THING FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO CLOSE THE BOOK I'M READING UNTIL I GET TO THE NEXT CHAPTER STOPPING JUST FEELS LIKE STOPPING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE OR PARAGRAPH
I ALWAYS TRY TO READ UP UNTIL THE NEXT LITTLE BREAK IN THE CHAPTER OR TO THE NEXT CHAPTER IF ITS NOT TOO LONG
DOES READING MAGAZINES COUNT SOMETIMES I READ BUT ITS MAGAZINES NOT BOOKS
I WAS THE SAME WAY AND DECIDED I WANTED TO MAKE A GOAL OF HOW MANY BOOKS TO READ IN A YEAR LET'S YOU SET A GOAL RECOMMENDS GOOD BOOKS AND KEEPS TRACK OF ONES YOU ALREADY OR WANT TO READ
I HAVE THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM I HAVE TO SET A PAGE LIMIT OR I'LL READ FOR HOURS SOMETIMES I DON'T STOP ANYWAY
YES SOURCE TYPE B PERSONALITY
NORMALLY MY GOAL IS TO GET TO THE END OF THE CHAPTER SO IT'S SIMILAR
YES IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT SORT OF THING
TRY HOLLY CRAP I READ A TON OF MOST OF THEM I WOULD NEVER GET THROUGH IF IT WAS A NORMAL BOOK
I HAVE LIMITS INSTEAD LIKE OKAY BONNNE MORE CHAPTER AND ILL GO TO SLEEP
IT'S ONLY WRONG IF YOU FOLD PAGES TO MARK WHERE YOU STOPPED
NO IT'S RIGHT I DO THE SAME THING
OF COURSE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THERE'S NO REAL WRONG WAY TO READ A BOOK AND OF COURSE THEY'RE RIGHT STILL I MUST ADMIT I USED TO DO THE SAME THING READING TO GET THROUGH THE BOOK CONSTANTLY THINKING ABOUT HOW FAR THROUGH I AM AND HOW MUCH I HAVE LEFT TO GO AND IT REALLY SCREWED UP MY COMPREHENSION

I'D BE FULLY IMMERSED IN A STORY THEN NOTICE I WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE END TO FINISH THE BOOK THAT SESSION THEN I'D FIND MYSELF UNCONTROLLABLY ALMOST SKIMMING THE BOOK TRYING TO GET TO THAT ENDING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND MISSING MOST OF THE STORY OR IF I WOULD HAPPEN TO NOTICE THAT I STILL HAD A LOT OF THE BOOK LEFT TO READ I'D START RUNNING MY EYES OVER THE PAGES TAKING IN NOTHING BECAUSE I'M BUSY STRESSING ABOUT HOW I'M NEVER GONNA GET THROUGH THIS ENTIRE THING OR EVEN GET TO ANY OF THE BIG EXCITING MOMENTS YOU CAN PROBABLY GUESS I FLIRT WITH ANXIETY MYSELF

I DIDN'T EVEN START TO BREAK THAT HABIT UNTIL I NOTICED I WOULD TEND TO BOOKS WITHOUT INTENDING TO I'D THINK HOW COOL THAT OPENING PASSAGE TO THE BOOK I READ A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS DECIDE I'D JUST READ THROUGH THAT PASSAGE AGAIN TO ENJOY IT THEN FIND MYSELF UNABLE TO STOP READING UNTIL I ONCE AGAIN REACHED THE END OF THE STORY I'D ENJOY THE BOOK A LOT MORE TOO YOU COULD SAY THIS IS DUE TO IT BEING EASIER TO TAKE IN SOMETHING YOU'VE ALREADY READ ONCE BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S MOSTLY THAT I WASN'T TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE BOOK SO MUCH AS SIMPLY ENJOYING THE ACT OF READING IT

NOW I PRETTY MUCH TRY TO READ A BOOK AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE AND FORGET ABOUT ALL SENSE OF PROGRESSING THROUGH IT I'VE FOUND IT FAR MORE ENJOYABLE THAN READING MERELY AS A MEANS TO GET TO A FUTURE SECTION OF THE BOOK OR TO A MEANINGLESS PROGRESS MARKER I HAD PREVIOUSLY SET

I WOULD HONESTLY SUGGEST SIMPLY TRYING TO CONCENTRATE ON LITERALLY JUST ENJOYING THE SINGLE PAGE YOU'RE READING AT ANY ONE TIME YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND YOURSELF WANTING TO CONTINUE BY ENJOYING THE NEXT PAGE THEN THE NEXT ETC

IN THE BIBLE PSALMS ANOTHER RANDOM THING I'VE FOUND HELPS A LOT AS AN ANXIOUS READER IS TO MAKE READING A WHOLE EVENT MAKE IT A FEAST FOR ALL SENSES MAKE YOURSELF A CUP OF COFFEE TEA BOOZE OR WHATEVER YOU ENJOY GET COMFY GET A SNACK MAKE THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE AN EXCUSE TO INDULGE
I ALWAYS WANT TO GET YO THE LAST PAGE OF REDDIN
YES IT'S WRONG STOP DOING THINGS YOU WANT TO DO
I GUESS THE KEY THING IS INTEREST AND ITS GOOD TO SET SOME GOALS WHILE READING
ONCE I START READING I NEED TO SET A LIMIT FOR WHEN TO STOP
I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE ENDED UP NOT SLEEPING WONDERING WHY MY CLOCK IS GOING OFFICIAL SAD TO SAY BUT SCHOOL ON THOSE DAYS WAS NOT VERY IMPORTANT
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT AS LONG AS YOU'RE ENJOYING THE EXPERIENCE IF SETTING GOALS HELPS THEN GO FOR IT
WHY NOT READ BOOKS THAT YOU ENJOY YOU'LL FIND IT HARD TO PUT THEM DOWN RATHER THAN FEELING LIKE YOU NEED TO GET THROUGH IT DON'T READ BOOKS SIMPLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET CALL THEM IMPORTANT OR CLASSICS ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO READING BESIDES YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER APPRECIATE THE CLASSICS AFTER YOU'VE SPENT A FEW YEARS ON OTHER TYPES OF BOOKS
I DO THAT TOO I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WITH IT
YOU'RE FINE
I THINK AS LONG AS YOU RETAIN WHAT YOU'RE READING I'VE HAD OCCASIONAL PAGE GOALS BUT SOMETIMES THE SECTIONS ARE DENSE OR VERY THOUGHT PROVOKING THAT YOU PUT THE BOOK DOWN TO PONDER WITHOUT MEETING YOUR TARGET THAT'S NOT BAD PER SE JUST DON'T LET PAGE COUNT BE YOUR ONLY DRIVER
PERSONALLY I DO THIS ALL THE TIME IF I DON'T I WOULD BE IN DEEP TROUBLE WITH MY PARENTS FOR NOT WASHING THE DISHES SINCE MORNING
I LIKE READING AN ENTIRE CHAPTER AT LEAST THIS OF COURSE DEPENDS ON HOW LONG THE CHAPTERS ARE BUT MOST OF THE BOOKS I READ HAVE PRETTY SHORT CHAPTERS
IF YOU DON T LIKE READING BOOKS DON T DO IT I DOUBT THERE ARE ANY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS TO READING
I DO THIS BAD LOL
WHY THE HELL WOULD THAT BE WRONG FISHING FOR PRAISE MUCH
I NEVER STRIVE FOR FOR A CERTAIN PAGE NUMBER BUT I DO TRY TO AT LEAST READ PAGES
YES YOU'RE DOING IT ALL WRONG
I READ A BOOK A DAY THAT DOESN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT I FELT LIKE BRAGGING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ASKED THIS QUESTION WHY WOULD IT MATTER HOW YOU READ
WHY ARE YOU READING IF YOU DON'T ENJOY IT
YES IT IS WRONG
READING SHOULD NOT BE A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IF YOU FORCE YOURSELF TO ENDURE AN ACTIVITY YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO BEGIN ENJOYING IT AT ANY POINT OR AT LEAST THAT'S MY FEELING ON THE SUBJECT

TAKE RUNNING I'D BEEN TOLD DOZENS HUNDREDS OF TIMES TO PUSH THROUGH THE PAIN AND EVENTUALLY YOU'LL COME TO LOVE RUNNING NOPE WHEN I THINK OF RUNNING I THINK OF PAIN SO HAS ENDURING PAIN MOTIVATED ME TO LOVE RUNNING NOPE IT MAKES ME GLAD THAT I DON'T HAVE TO RUN PERIOD

WHEN I HAD TO RUN I SET MYSELF A GOAL TO FORCE MYSELF NOT TO QUIT RUNNING IT DID NOT INCREASE MY LOVE OF RUNNING BUT IT DID KEEP ME GOING I HATED EVERY MINUTE OF IT ESPECIALLY THAT LAST PART WHERE I WAS CLOSE TO MY GOAL I RELISHED THE FINISH LINE THANKING GOD I COULD FINALLY STOP RUNNING

SO IF YOU SIMPLY WANT TO FORCE YOURSELF TO ENDURE READING FINE IF YOU WANT TO LEARN TO ENJOY READING FIND SOMETHING TO READ THAT ENTICES YOU TO TURN THE NEXT PAGE JUST TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
I LOVE READING AND I CAN'T STOP SO DDK HOW TO GIVE U ADVICE
LISTEN I'M ALMOST READY TO GO OUT AND MAKE A LIFE IN THE WILD AS SOON AS I'VE READ THESE FOURTEEN BOOKS OK
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS SEEN A LOT OF NORTH WEST I FOUND THE HUNTER NEARLY UNREADABLE ALL REFERENCES TO TASMANIAN TOWNS CULTURE ETC ARE OMITTED AND TASMANIA PAINTED AS AN ISOLATED MIDDLE OF NOWHERE PLACE YOU'D EASILY FORGET HUMANS HAVE LIVED THERE FOR UPWARDS OF YEARS IT SEEMS SHE GOT ALL HER ECOLOGICAL INFO FROM A TEXTBOOK WITHOUT EVER STEPPING FOOT IN TASMANIA HER UNDERSTANDING OF ITS PEOPLE GOES NO FURTHER THAN NOBLE WHITE HUNTERS LIVED HERE ONCE NOW IT'S ALL BOGANS AND HIPPIES
BEASTINGS SOUNDS INTERESTING ANYONE HERE RECOMMEND IT
KNOW WHAT I LIKED MOST ABOUT THE LIST THE GOODREADS LINKS SO EASY TO ADD TO MY WANT TO READ LIST SUCH CONVENIENCE MUCH CLICKY
DESERT SOLITAIRE ISN'T ON THIS LIST ABSURD


I WOULD ADD KNUT GROWTH OF THE SOIL WHICH AWARDED HIM THE NOBEL PRIZE REALLY REALLY GOOD BOOK IN MY OPINION
I ALWAYS LIKED THE FUR COUNTRY MYSELF
HIRE DAVID LYNCH FOR A TV SERIES KYLE MCLACHLAN AS LETO MAX VON SYDOW AS
AS SHOWN BY THEIR CATALOG THEY ARE REALLY HIT OR MISS FOR EVERY INTERSTELLAR THERE IS A SUCKERPUNCH

LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT BRING BACK PATRICK STEWART AS KING LEO
DUNE WAS THE WORST SF FILM I HAVE SEEN IF YOU HADN'T READ THE BOOK I HAD IT MUST HAVE BEEN JUST WORD SALAD AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE IMAGERY TO YOU
PLEASE DON'T BE BAD PLEASE DON'T BE BAD PLEASE DON'T BE BAD
THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION I'LL PUT IT ON MY TO READ LIST I NOTICED IT'S THE SECOND BOOK IN A SERIES HAVE YOU READ THE FIRST BOOK IS TREAT US LIKE DOGS CONFUSING WITHOUT HAVING READ THE SCHOOL ON CONTENT ROAD FIRST
THAT'S REALLY NICE OF HIM I'VE ALWAYS BEEN TEMPTED TO ASK HIM TO SIGN HIS REAL NAME JIM GRANT ON A LEE CHILD BOOK
NOW I AM TEMPTED TO SET MY HOUSE ON FIRE

BOO THAT YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THE ORDEAL OF LOSING ALL YOUR STUFF YAY THAT YOU GOT A SIGNED BOOK AND CAN NOW REBUILD YOUR COLLECTION AND LIFE
DELETED
MARGARET ATWOOD HER STYLE OF WRITING IS BEAUTIFUL AND HER STORIES HAVE A WAY OF STAYING WITH ME LONG AFTER I'VE FINISHED THE BOOKS
I LOVE THE WAY SHE WRITES FEMALE CHARACTERS THE WAY THEY'RE ALWAYS SO NORMAL WITH ALL THE UGLY BEAUTIFUL HUMANNESS RIGHT UNDER THE SURFACE
I FEEL AS IF A LOT OF HER BOOKS AND THEMES ARE COMMENTS ON THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN AS WELL AND THAT'S SOMETHING I QUIETLY ENJOY
KURT VONNEGUT DEFINITELY HIS WRITING STYLE IS WONDERFUL AND FUNNY BUT IT REALLY CUTS TO THE BONE WITH ITS HUMANITY AND WIT I CAN REREAD HIS BOOKS ANYTIME AND STILL GET SOMETHING NEW FROM THEM
HARUKI MURAKAMI BY FAR I JUST LOVE HIS MIX BETWEEN REALISM AND SURREAL MAGIC FIRST BOOK I READ BY HIM WAS NORWEGIAN WOOD WHICH I PICKED UP JUST BECAUSE I LIKED THE TITLE AND IT BECAME MY FAVORITE NOVEL AFTER JUST ONE READ AFTER THAT I WENT ON A BINGE AND BOUGHT EVERYTHING ELSE HE'D WRITTEN SO FAR AND I CAN SAY THAT THERE WASN'T ONE BOOK I DID NOT ENJOY

HE ALSO BROUGHT ME TO GET INTO MODERN JAPANESE LITERATURE AND I FOUND NYU MURAKAMI BANANA YOSHIMOTO KENZABURO OE AND NATSUO KIRIN IN THE PROCESS WHOM I ALL LIKED VERY MUCH

EDIT SPELLING
DIFFERENT WRITERS OFFER DIFFERENT THINGS BUT OVERALL I THINK THE AUTHOR WHO MOST BROADLY DELIVERS CONSISTENTLY ENGAGING PLOTS DIMENSIONAL CHARACTERS AND PROFOUND MESSAGES IS ACTUALLY STEPHEN KING FOR ME WHICH IS FUNNY BECAUSE HE HAS A REPUTATION FOR BEING CONFINED AS A GENRE WRITER I DON'T THINK ANY OF HIS BOOKS EVEN BREAK MY TOP BUT HIS BOOKS ARE CONSISTENTLY GREAT FOR ME WHEREAS I FIND MOST AUTHORS HAVE SOME GREAT SOME DECENT ETC
PHILIP KING DICK I HAVE READ OVER OF HIS NOVELS HE'S THE GREATEST SCI-FI WRITER IN MY OPINION HE PACKS HUNDREDS OF IDEAS IN EACH BOOK ANY ONE WOULD MAKE AN AMAZING STORY HE MAKES ME QUESTION EVERYTHING AND EACH TIME I A PIECE OF WORK I SEE IT IN A COMPLETELY NEW WAY GENIUS
AS OF RIGHT NOW MY ANSWER WOULD PROBABLY BE CORMAC MCCARTHY BUT THAT COULD CONCEIVABLY CHANGE ONCE I'VE READ MORE FROM WRITERS LIKE ATWOOD FAULKNER MORRISON AND STEINBECK TO NAME A FEW
RAY BRADBURY HE WAS MY FIRST ADULT LEVEL WRITER AFTER HAVING GRADUATED FROM THE HARDY BOYS I FIRST PICKED UP THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES AT AGE TWELVE AND I CREDIT IT WITH TEACHING ME TO LOOK AT THINGS FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVES HONORABLE MENTION GOES TO FRANK HERBERT WHO CONTINUED THAT EDUCATION WHEN I FIRST PICKED UP DUNE AT AGE FIFTEEN
MY FAVORITE WRITER IS ISAAC ASIMOV
I STARTED READING HIS NOVELS WHEN I WAS ABOUT AND IT WAS A BRAND NEW WORLD TO ME WITH TIME I STARTED TO APPRECIATE MORE NOT JUST THE STYLE THAT IS QUITE PRAGMATIC RELATIVE TO OTHERS BUT ALSO ALL THE MEANINGS BEHIND HIS WORKS FROM THE FOUNDATION CYCLE TO THE I ROBOT COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES IT BAFFLES ME HOW AN AUTHOR OF THIS CALIBER HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY IN THE SCHOOLS JUST TO GIVE YOU FOOD FOR THOUGHTS OR WHAT HAS FED MINES FOR A LONG TIME TAKE AS EXAMPLES THE IMPLICATIONS OF A COMBINED SCIENCE OF SOCIOLOGY AND MATHEMATIC THE OF THE FOUNDATION CYCLE WHICH HAS HAD SOME DEVELOPMENT IN MATHEMATICS WITH THE FIELD OF POPULATION DYNAMICS OR ONE OF THE MOST MIND SHATTERING STORY IN I ROBOT AT LEAST FOR ME REASON WHERE HE TRIES TO EXPLAIN WHAT LIES BEHIND FAITH BY USING LOGIC THE SAME ORDEAL WAS TAKEN BY SOUTH AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO WITH A DIFFERENT APPROACH OR WHEN IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF HIS BOOK OF PHYSIC HE TRIES TO EXPLAIN WHAT MAKES US HUMAN AND WHAT DIFFERENTIATE US FROM ANIMALS
I REALLY SUGGEST TO READ HIS WORKS NOT JUST FOR THE STORIES THEMSELVES WHICH BY THE WAY ARE REALLY ENJOYABLE BUT WITH AN OPEN MIND ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE CONCEPTS PRESENTED IN THEM
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A TIE BETWEEN KURT VONNEGUT AND MARK TWAIN FOR ME I APPRECIATE COMEDY ON THE FACE WITH PROFUNDITY IN THE SOUL
BRANDON SANDERSON

GREAT WORLDS LOGICAL MAGIC SYSTEMS INTERESTING CHARACTERS PLOTS WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE
OVERALL TERRY PRITCHETT HIS BOOKS ARE FUN TO READ BUT THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD QUOTES AND LESSONS TO PULL FROM THEM

VLADIMIR NABOKOV IS WORTH NOTING FOR THE PROSE ALONE
LEO TOLSTOY

THE WAY HE PORTRAYS THE LIFE OF A PERSON IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT AND IN MY OPINION ENGAGING HIS CHARACTERS FEEL AS IF THEY ARE REAL AND LIKEABLE PEOPLE
EASY QUESTION HARD TO ANSWER WHILE THE OLD LITERARY CLASSICS WHETHER WE'RE TALKING DOSTOYEVSKY TOLSTOY JOYCE OR OTHERS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MY READING AND PERCEPTION OF LITERATURE I'LL GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION

EVEN THOUGH HE HAS BECOME ALMOST TOO POPULAR I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT GEORGE ROYAL ROYAL MARTIN HAS DONE FOR FANTASY WHILE THERE ARE A FEW IMPACTFUL AND VERY DECENT WRITERS IN THE GENRE STARTING WITH TZOLKIN THE GENRE HAD REACHED A POINT WHERE VERY FEW PUBLISHERS WANTED TO PUBLISH ANYTHING ELSE THAN YA FANTASY WITHOUT CONSIDERING ADULTS AS A TARGET AUDIENCE FOR FANTASY THIS HAS CHANGED WITH THE POPULARITY OF A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE AND FOR THIS ALONE HE DESERVES ALL POSSIBLE PRAISE ASIDE FROM THAT BEING ABLE TO WRITE IN WIDELY CHANGING 1ST PERSON PERSPECTIVES THROUGHOUT THE SERIES REPRESENTING ALL CHARACTERS AS HUMANS THERE ARE FEW IF ANY TRULY GOOD OR EVIL CHARACTERS IN HIS FICTION AND I ADMIRE HIS ABILITY TO WRITE KIDS AND ADULTS MALE OR FEMALE AS COMPLETE REBATEABLE HUMANS IN A FANTASTIC SETTING

MY DEFINITION OF FAVORITE WRITER CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME THOUGH DOUGLAS ADAMS OR TERRY PRITCHETT GOTTEN THE NOD SIMPLY FOR BEING SO DARN FUN ORWELL AND HURLEYS POLITICAL WORKS MADE ME RETHINK MY PERCEPTION OF BOTH THE WORLD AND OUR SOCIETIES I APPRECIATE MURAKAMI FOR WRITING OUTSIDE OF MY WESTERN GENRE NORMS IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HOW TO DISCUSS IT THOUGH
NEIL CAIMAN HE WEAVES A PERFECT BLEND OF FANTASY HORROR WHIMSY AND REALISM FOR ME HE HAS THAT WAY PUTTING WORDS TOGETHER TO SAY WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS FELT AND NEVER KNEW HOW TO EXPRESS IT'S LIKE THOSE WORDS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES THAT EXPRESS EMOTIONS THAT ARE OTHERWISE NAMELESS IN ENGLISH THAT'S HOW HIS WRITING MAKES ME FEEL I DON'T LOVE EVERYTHING HE WRITES BUT I CAN HEAR HIS VOICE IN EVERYTHING HE WRITES AND HIS VOICE IS WHAT APPEALS TO ME IT'S LIKE STORIES YOU ALWAYS FELT ARE FINALLY BROUGHT TO LIFE AND YOU REALIZE YES THIS IS THE STORY I WAS WAITING TO READ

THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO TO DESCRIBE IT
ERNEST HEMINGWAY I GET PLEASURE FROM EVERY LINE OF HIS WRITING HIS PROSE IS BEAUTIFULLY POETIC

ALSO AS A YEAR OLD MALE I FIND HIS THEMES AND STORIES REALLY HIT HOME FOR ME I AM ABLE TO CONNECT TO EVERY ONE OF HIS CHARACTERS IN SOME WAY
IRVINE WELSH AS A SCOT HIS WORK RESONATES WITH ME I'M USED TO THE HUMOR AND THE NOVELS ARE MORE IMMERSIVE WHEN YOU KNOW THE SETTING
YOU COULD SAY TRAINSPOTTING GOT ME INTO READING IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT AFTER READING HIS OTHER WORK SUCH AS CARIBOU STORK NIGHTMARES I WAS SOLD AND THEN NATURALLY PURCHASED THE REST OF HIS BOOKS I LOVE DARK HUMOR AND MORBID CONCEPTS SO IT GOES HAND IN HAND AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON BEBITE
GEORGE ORWELL HANDS DOWN IF YOU READ HIS BIO HE HAS SEEN A LOT OF STUFF IN HIS LIFE THE WAY HE TAKES REAL LIFE EXPERIENCES SCENARIOS AND MOLDS THEM INTO HIS BOOKS IS STUNNING
I GET A LOT OF FLAK FOR THIS WHEN I TELL PEOPLE BUT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY STEPHEN KING IS MY FAVORITE WRITER I GET SO ENGAGED IN HIS STORIES AND I READ UNTIL MY EYES HURT AND I PHYSICALLY CAN'T CONTINUE HE HAS SUCH TALENT IN CREATING COMPLETELY DEVELOPED CHARACTERS EVEN CHARACTERS THAT ONLY EXIST FOR A COUPLE OF PAGES IT'S INCREDIBLE
NEIL CAIMAN I'VE REACHED A POINT WHERE IF IT HAS HIS NAME ON IT I'LL READ IT WON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT CHECKING OUT THE DESCRIPTION OR LOOKING UP REVIEWS I LOVE ALL OF HIS WORK
PHILIP ROTH BECAUSE HE'S ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS AND INCOMPARABLY PERCEPTIVE MAYBE NOT TYPICALLY IN THE SAME BOOKS BUT I FIND THIS TO BE TRUE NONETHELESS
BRET EASTON ELLIS THE CONVERSATIONAL STREAM OF CONCISENESS WRITING ALWAYS DRAWS ME IN
I ALWAYS END UP MENTIONING JOHN JEREMIAH SULLIVAN IN THESE THREADS TO THE POINT THAT I'M ACTUALLY A LITTLE INTIMIDATED TO GO BACK AND HIS STUFF YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY SOMETIMES A BOOK IS GREAT BECAUSE OF THE MOMENT YOU READ IT IN THAT SAID I THINK THE WAY THAT HE APPROACHES DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND MANAGES TO LAYER MEANING AND NUANCE INTO HIS WRITING IS FANTASTIC BOTH PULPHEAD AS A COLLECTION AND BLOOD HORSES AS A MEMOIR WERE TACKLING SO MUCH MORE THAN THE SURFACE SUGGESTED JUST A WONDERFUL ESSAYIST AND SOMEONE I ALWAYS RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE
BIG FAN OF ROGER ZELAZNY

HE GOT HIS START DOING SHORT STORIES FOR SF AND FANTASY PULPS IN THE WHERE HE LEARNED TO GAIN AND HOLD THE INTEREST IN A HURRY

HE STARTED WRITING NOVELS IN THE LATE BUILDING ON THAT SKILL SET BY WRITING EFFECTIVE SHORT STORIES AND EXPANDING ON THEM AS CHAPTERS IN LARGER WORKS

BUT HE'S BEST KNOWN FOR BLURRING THE LINE BETWEEN FANTASY AND SF LORD OF LIGHT HUGO WINNER FOR BEST NOVEL AND NEBULA NOMINEE IN THE SAME CATEGORY IS AN EXAMPLE OF BOTH THE QUALITIES I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO ANYONE WHO HAS READ IT AND NOT THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT
GEORGE ROYAL R MARTIN OR J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN BOTH HAVE WEAVED SUCH DEEPLY IMAGINATIVE AND IMMERSIVE WORLDS THAT HAVE TAKEN ME AWAY FROM ALL THE STRUGGLES AND STRESS OF EVERY DAY LIFE IS THERE ANYTHING BETTER THAN HEARING THESE EPIC STORIES FROM MARTIN AND BEING PLUNGED INTO THE POINT OF VIEW OF SO MANY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS AND TO TZOLKIN AND HEARING SUCH FANTASTIC HEROIC TALES OF COURSE WORK CAN BE SAD AND TERRIBLE BUT STILL IT'S SIMPLY INCREDIBLE THE SHEER COMPLEXITY MAKES ME JUST SIT HERE IN AWE
JOSE SARAMAGO NOT SURE WHY IT JUST WORKS
JOHN FOWLES
I DON'T THINK THIS GUY REALLY GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES HIS STORIES ARE INTENSELY IMMERSIVE BOTH VIA SPELLBINDING PLOTS AND IMMERSIVE SETTINGS AND HIS PROSE REALLY IS BEAUTIFUL HE WROTE THE MAGUS THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN THE COLLECTOR IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM I'D SUGGEST YOU CHECK OUT HIS STORIES AND REALLY THE LESS YOU KNOW GOING INTO THEM THE BETTER
STEINBECK BECAUSE EVERY REASON

THE ONLY FAULTS IN HIS WRITINGS IMO ARE THE WAY WOMEN WERE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY PORTRAYED IN A VERY NEGATIVE WAY AND THE WAY HE WROTE ABOUT RELIGION
I HAVE MANY FAVORITES BUT AS FOR CONTEMPORARIES IT HAS TO BE JONATHAN COE HIS BOOKS ALWAYS STRIKE A CORD WITH ME
EMILE ZOLA AND SIMILARLY HONORE DE BALZAC ARE MY FAVORITES RIGHT I'VE REALLY ENJOYED WHAT ZOLA DID IN WRITING THE SERIES OF NOVELS
IT'S A TOSS-UP BETWEEN ROBERT A HEINLEIN AND ORSON SCOTT CARD THEY BOTH HAVE AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO WRITE VERY HUMAN CHARACTERS AND EVOKE THE KIND OF EMOTIONS THAT CHOKE YOU UP REGARDLESS OF THEIR PERSONAL LIVES OR POLITICS THEY BOTH CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN CONDITION AND CAN PUT IT INTO WORDS
JUST ONE NO CHANCE THAT'S LIKE ASKING WHO'S MY FAVORITE MUSICIAN OR FILMMAKER OR CHILD
KAZUO ISHIGURO HAS A BEAUTY AND RESTRAINT IN HIS PROSE THAT HITS LIKE A PUNCH TO THE STOMACH REMAINS OF THE DAY AND NEVER LET ME GO ARE PHENOMENAL
MILAN KUNDERA

THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING IS THE MOST TRUE AND REAL DEPICTION DESCRIPTION OF HUMANITY AND OUR CONDITION YOU WILL EVER READ IN ALL THE WORLD OF FICTION

EVERY LINE IN ALL OF HIS NOVELS WHEN HE DESCRIBES THE MOTIVE OF A CHARACTER FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE OR AN INNATE INTANGIBLE TRUTH OF ANY EMOTION IN UNDERSTANDABLE HUMANISTIC WORDS IS ABSOLUTE BEAUTY

HAVE YOU EVER QUESTIONED LOVE THE RIDICULOUSNESS OF ROMANCE THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF SEX LIFE UNDER TOTALITARIANISM INFIDELITY THE HUMAN RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURE AND ANIMALS

KUNDERA SPEAKS OF THESE THINGS SO CLEARLY AND CONCISELY WITH A KNOWLEDGE THAT SEEMS ALMOST DEIFIC AND STILL THERE ARE MOMENTS WHERE HE WILL ADMIT HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY X DID Y

IN MY OPINION HE IS THE MOST UNDERRATED WRITER AND TERRIBLY UNKNOWN IN THAT RESPECT FOR THE EXISTENTIAL MAGNITUDE OF HIS WORKS OF THE CENTURY
HAMSUN
JACK KEROUAC

HIS RHYTHMIC DESCRIPTIVE PROSE KEEPS MY MIND ENVELOPED THROUGHOUT EVERY PAGE I LOVE THE WAY HE DESCRIBES THE SEEMINGLY MUNDANE AND ORDINARY AND MAKES THEM SEEM FANTASTIC AND IMPORTANT HE HELPED ME SEE THE BEAUTY IN THE SMALL THINGS IN LIFE AND HIS PROSE KEEPS ME INTERESTED IN HIS NOVELS NO MATTER WHAT THE ACTUAL SUBJECT MATTER IS

HIS COMMONLY EXPRESSED THEMES OF FEELING LOST AND SEARCHING FOR A GREATER TRUTH IN AMERICA ARE HIGHLY TO MY OWN FEELINGS THE SUBJECT MATTER OF A LOT OF THE STORIES HE TELLS ARE ENTERTAINING TO ME GENERAL DEBAUCHERY TRAVEL BOOZE DRUGS GIRLS NATURE
AS FAR AS QUALITY WRITING GOES ANOTHER VOTE FOR NEIL CAIMAN NOT ONLY IS HIS IMAGINATION INCREDIBLE BUT IT'S COMBINED WITH AN ABILITY WITH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THAT IS JUST SO FAR BEYOND THE VAST MAJORITY OF OTHER PEOPLE HE'S AMAZING HE CAN WRITE IN SO MANY FORMS LONG FICTION SHORT FICTION PICTURE BOOKS GRAPHIC NOVELS POETRY TV SHOWS MOVIES BLOGS AND IT'S ALL GOOD WHO CAN DO THAT

FOR NOSTALGIA COMFORT GOING BACK TO OVER AND OVER PATRICIA COUNTY WREDE WROTE SOME YA BOOKS THAT WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE
OSCAR WILDE HIS WORKS ARE FILLED WITH WIT AND CHARM AND ALSO HEARTBREAK PLUS HE'S INFINITELY QUOTABLE
FOR A LONG I TIME I CONSIDERED CARLOS RUIZ AFTON MY FAVORITE WRITER REASON BEING THAT I HAD NEVER READ ANOTHER AUTHOR THAT WROTE ATMOSPHERE LIKE HE DID I NEVER REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT THAT ASPECT OF A NOVEL WAS UNTIL I READ HIS BOOKS AND BECAME TOTALLY ENGROSSED IN THEIR WORLD HE'S ALSO ABLE TO INTERTWINE THE PLOT INTO THE PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL LANDSCAPE OF THE SETTING WHICH ONLY ADDS TO THE DEPTH OF THE STORY

THE REASON I SAY I CONSIDERED IS BECAUSE I ALSO HEAVILY LEAN TOWARD RICK RIORDAN BUT FOR A DIFFERENT REASON I'VE READ ALL HIS BOOKS SINCE THE ORIGINAL PERCY JACKSON AND I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN ANOTHER AUTHOR EVOLVE AS MUCH AS HE HAS WHEN I FIRST STARTED READING MAGNUS CHASE I HANDS DOWN THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER THAN ANY AJO OR HOO BOOK THE MAIN THING FOR ME WAS THAT THE CHARACTERS SEEMED SO MUCH MORE REAL THAN ANY OF THE PERCY JACKSON CHARACTERS AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT THEY WERE SO MUCH MORE BELIEVABLE AND REBATEABLE NOT ONLY THAT BUT SO MUCH CHARACTER DIVERSITY HAS BEEN ADDED SINCE HE FIRST STARTED WRITING I BELIEVE THAT HE REALIZED JUST HOW WIDE HIS YOUTH AUDIENCE IS I MEAN HE HAS A GENDERFLUID CHARACTER FOR GODSAKE COMPARING HIS WRITING AND CHARACTERS NOW TO WHEN HE FIRST STARTED IT'S OBVIOUS HE'S COME A LONG WAY AND I'M HAPPY BECAUSE OF THAT
DALAILAMA

VERY INSPIRING AND LIFE LOVE CHANGING BOOKS
HERMAN MELVILLE FOR THE DOOMED LYRICAL OVERWHELMING PERFECTION OF AMONG SEVERAL OTHER GREAT NOVELS

RAY BRADBURY FOR BEING ABLE TO BEAUTIFULLY CAPTURE A MOMENT THAT ANYBODY CAN RELATE TO AND JUST ABSOLUTE MAGICAL STORYTELLING

NEIL CAIMAN FOR BEING THIS RAY BRADBURY

J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN FOR MASTERFULLY CREATING THE ONLY PIECE OF FANTASY LITERATURE THAT MATTERS IMO

CHARLES BUKOWSKI FOR MAKING POETRY ENJOYABLE TO ME AND BEING A MANIC GENIUS WHO CAN ALWAYS SAY SOMETHING PROFOUND IN A SIMPLE WAY

HUNTER SOUTH THOMPSON FOR MAKING ME LAUGH MY ASS OFF AND CUTTING RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THINGS IN ABSURD WAYS NOT TO MENTION THE AWE-INSPIRING LIFESTYLE

NOTABLE MENTIONS DOSTOEVSKY KNUT HAMSUN GOETHE LEWIS CARROLL HOVERCRAFT POE
ROYAL J ELLARY I LIKED ALL OF HIS WORK SO FAR
I GOT A FEW OTHERS I ALWAYS LIKE THE BOOKS FROM BUT ELLARY IS MY FAVORITE I READ THAT HIS STYLE IS NOT THAT EASY TO CATEGORIZE A MIXT BETWEEN THRILLER NOIR WITH A TOUCH OF SOMETHING ELSE

IT IS NOW AND WILL FOREVER BE PAT CONROY WHO WAS TAKEN FROM US FAR TOO SOON
STEINBECK FOR MAKING ME LOVE LITERATURE WHEN I WAS YOUNG I READ LOTS OF HORROR SF ETC STEINBECK WAS THE FIRST SERIOUS WRITER I READ AND HE OPENED THE DOOR TO HEMINGWAY TOLSTOY FAULKNER BRONTES HENRY JAMES MELVILLE AND MANY OTHERS STILL READ LOTS OF GENRE STUFF BUT AM A MUCH MORE WELL-ROUNDED READER BECAUSE OF STEINBECK
DOROTHY PARKER SHE WAS AMERICA'S GREATEST WIT CLEVEREST DARLING AND TRULY SHAPED THE HISTORY OF POPULAR LITERATURE PARKER IS TRULY INSPIRING AND I FEEL VERY LUCKY TO HAVE ENCOUNTERED HER WORK AS A YOUNG PERSON HER SHORT STORIES ARE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY CUTTING EXAMINATIONS OF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN DREAM LIFE THAT I'VE EVER READ SHE WOULD HAVE MADE A WONDERFUL NOVELIST

PART OF HER APPEAL IS HER TRAGIC EXISTENCE THE TRAGEDY IN HER NEVER REACHING HER DREAM OF WRITING THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL OF HER DEEP DISSATISFACTION WITH HER LIFE AS WITH MANY OF THE BEST ARTISTS SHE CRAFTER HER PAIN INTO SOME TRULY BRILLIANT WORK I THINK IT'S ALL VERY WORTHY BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T READ SOME OF HER SHORT STORIES I WOULD RECOMMEND IT BIG BLONDE WON AN O HENRY AND IS ONE OF THE MOST POIGNANT PIECES OF SHORT LITERATURE TO COME OUT OF THE CENTURY IN MY OPINION
FOLIO SCOTT FITZGERALD I HAVE TWO PORTRAITS OF HIM TATTOOED ON MY LEGS AND HAVE READ ALL OF HIS WORK YOU COULD TAKE ALMOST ANY TWO LINES FROM ANY OF HIS BOOKS AND IT COULD READ AS POETRY I'M ALSO FASCINATED BY JAZZ AGE CULTURE IN GENERAL AND A LOT OF THAT REVOLVES AROUND THE FITZGERALD FUNNY I HAD TO READ GATSBY FOR A HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH CLASS AND I HATED IT BUT I READ IT AGAIN IN COLLEGE FOR FUN AND FELL IN LOVE I'VE BEEN OBSESSED EVER SINCE
SEEMS STRANGE TO SAY IT BUT PYNCHON HAS BECOME MY FAVORITE WRITER HE IS USUALLY A PRETTY TOUGH READ HOWEVER HIS WRITING IS SO OFF KILTER THAT JUST WHEN I START TO BOG DOWN SOMETHING HILARIOUS AND OUT OF LEFT FIELD HAPPENS MASON DIXON BLEW MY MIND WITH ITS CENTURY PROSE HISTORICAL RESEARCH AND THE UNRELENTING LOVE OF A FRENCH CHEF BY A MECHANICAL DUCK
GEORGE SAUNDERS HE CREATES ABSURD YET BELIEVABLE DYSTOPIAS WITH CHARACTERS THAT SOMEHOW MANAGE TO REFLECT THE BEST AND THE WORST HUMANITY HAS TO OFFER I LOVE MARGARET ATWOOD AS WELL BUT SEEN HER MENTIONED ALREADY
GEORGETTE HEYER NOT ONLY WERE HER BOOKS SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE USED AS TEACHING LITERATURE AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY BUT I HAVE YET TO FIND SOMEONE WHO WRITES WROTE WITH AS MUCH FINESSE SUBTLE WIT AND GRACE THAT SHE DID SHE INTERJECTED WRY AND INSIGHTFUL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT SOCIETY AT THAT TIME INTO HER BOOKS SO SKILLFULLY HER HUMOR IS THE KIND THAT TAKES YOU BY SURPRISE BY HOW DAMNED FUNNY IT IS HER HEROES AND HEROINES ARE THE KIND THAT STAY WITH YOU FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN SAVORING HER BOOKS OVER THE YEARS AND I'M GOING TO BE SO SAD WHEN I FINALLY FINISH THEM ALL
KRISTIN HANNAH MOSTLY BECAUSE SHE SETS HER NOVELS IN WESTERN WASHINGTON WHERE I LIVE

I ALSO ENJOY LISA GENOVA BECAUSE SHE WRITES ABOUT BRAIN DISEASES
CURRENTLY NEAL STEPHENSON HE'S ONE OF THE BEST MODERN SCI-FI WRITERS HE ALWAYS DIGS DEEPLY INTO WHATEVER HE'S WRITING ABOUT UNLIKE MOST AUTHORS WHO THINK THE PASSING ACQUITTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT IS ENOUGH TO CONDEMN IT OR MISUSE IT FOR THE SAKE OF DRAMA I LOVE HIS STYLE AND HIS HEROES AND ALSO HE SEEMS TO BE ONE OF A VERY FEW WESTERN SCI-FI AUTHORS WHO GIVES RUSSIAN HEROES POSITIVE ROLES BUT THAT'S A MINOR POINT

THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT HIM HE'S NOT VERY GOOD AT WRITING ENDINGS WHILE I LOVE NEARLY ALL HIS BOOKS THE BIG U WAS THE ONLY ONE I DISLIKED AND HE DISOWNED THIS ONE LONG AGO THE LAST PAGE ALWAYS LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED
TERRY PRITCHETT AND STEVEN ERIKSON

PRITCHETT IS THE BEST SATIRIST AND HUMORIST I HAVE READ HIS BOOKS HAVE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF COMPREHENSION AND HIS TREATMENT OF DEATH IS THE BEST I HAVE READ BEATING OUT SANDMAN

STEVEN ERIKSON IS IMO THE BEST FANTASY AUTHOR LIVING HE DEFIES FANTASY CONVENTION HE PLAYS WITH TROPES HE DOES SOME OF THE MOST AUTHENTIC AND DEEP WORLD-BUILDING I HAVE EVER READ AND HIS BOOKS ARE A TREASURE TO REREAD
ALDOUS HUXLEY BRAVE NEW WORLD IS BEAUTIFUL VISIONARY TIMELESS UNFORTUNATELY
IT'S LIKE ASKING MOTHER TO CHOOSE HER FAVORITE CHILD
ANYWAY HERE'S THE FEW OF MY FAVORITES
MURAKAMI FOR HIS MYSTICAL SURREALISM YOU READ HIS WORK AND SOMETHING MOVES INSIDE YOU THAT YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED UNTIL THEN

NEIL CAIMAN FOR HIS STORYTELLING AND WORDS THERE IS FLOW TO HIS WRITING WHICH PULLS YOU INTO THE FANTASTICAL CURRENT SO SMOOTHLY IT FEELS LIKE DREAM

BRANDON SANDERSON FAR MOST GREAT IN WORDBUILDING I HAVE READ ALL OF HIS WORKS

JOHN GREEN QUITE CAPTURES THE ADOLESCENCE

WE ALL HAVE RELATIONSHIP WITH GARM

AND CHARLES BUKOWSKI AND WHO DOESN'T LOVE ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
I'VE BEEN READING A FAIR NUMBER OF BOOKS THIS YEAR TRYING TO DO A BOOK READING CHALLENGE ON GOODREADS AND HAVE READ SEVERAL PALAHNIUK BOOKS THIS SUMMER

INVISIBLE MONSTERS WAS DELIGHTFULLY FUCKED UP AND I JUST FINISHED READING SURVIVOR A FEW DAYS AGO
EITHER SHIRLEY JACKSON OR ROBERT ACKMAN AS A GUY WHO WRITES OR TRIES TO WRITE SUBTLE ATMOSPHERIC HORROR WITH A LITERARY BENT JACKSON AND WRITING HAS BEEN INVALUABLE AS A GUIDE

HONORARY MENTIONS FRANZ KAFKA JESSE BALL AND HARLAN ELLISON
DON DELILLLO HIS ABILITY TO INCORPORATE AMERICAN CULTURE INTO HIS NOVELS ALONG WITH HIS STRONG SENSE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INTERACTING WITHIN THE SOCIETY IS UNPARALLELED AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THEMATICALLY HE CAN BE A BIT REPETITIVE BUT STILL STRONG IN HIS CHARACTERS DEVELOPMENT AND MOTIVATIONS
DAMN I HAVE TOO MANY GRACE PALEY SUSAN SONTAG ADIE SMITH ATWOOD MURAKAMI IT'S TOO MANY I'M SORRY
KAZUO ISHIGURO IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVOURITE AUTHORS FIRST BOOK I READ FROM HIM IS THE REMAINS OF THE DAY AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIS WRITING STYLE THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING HIDDEN UNDER THE SURFACE BUT THE MAIN PLOT IS QUITE SIMPLE AND CAPTIVATING CAN ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED HIS NEW BOOK THE BURIED GIANT
ALWAYS A TOUGH PICK BUT ON THE BALANCE I THINK I NEED TO SAY LOIS MCMASTER BUJOLD

HER NOVELS NEVER SEEM PULPY BUT ARE STILL THE PROSE FLOWS WELL AND IS STILL ACCESSIBLE WITHOUT BEING DUMBED DOWN THE CHARACTERS ARE INTERESTING AND USUALLY FLAWED SOMEHOW

MY OPINION THERE IS NOT ORIGINAL SHE'S A TIME HUGO WINNER FOR BEST NOVEL

THERE ARE A LOT OF AUTHORS WHOSE WORK I ENJOY SOME FOR INTERESTING PROSE SOME FOR WORLD-BUILDING SOME FOR WRITING AND SOME FRANKLY AS GUILTY PLEASURES BUT BUJOLD IS THE BEST BALANCE FOR ME AND SHE CONSISTENTLY SCORES HIGH IN EVERY CATEGORY
STEVEN ERIKSON HIS DRY BUT SOMEHOW ALSO LIVELY AND DARK TONE IS PART OF WHAT MADE THE MALAYAN BOOK OF THE FALLEN MY FAVORITE WORK OF LITERATURE EVER THE PHILOSOPHICAL THEMES AND LIVING CHARACTERS ARE ALSO A PLUS IN MY BOOK

HONORABLE MENTIONS

STEPHEN KING SHAKESPEARE MATTHEW STOVER HOVERCRAFT
PROBABLY PYNCHON I FEEL A REAL AFFINITY WITH HIS WORLD-VIEW INHERENT VICE AND MASON DIXON ARE PROBABLY BOTH AMONG MY TWO FAVOURITE NOVELS OF ALL TIME THE DUDE IS ABLE TO TACKLE THE COMPLEX AND DEPRESSING REALITIES OF OUR WORLD WHILE NOT FORGETTING THE TRULY GOOD AND IMPORTANT THINGS THAT KEEP US GOING AND HIS BOOKS ARE BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN VERY ENTERTAINING AND OFTEN HILARIOUS MANY OF MY FAVOURITE SCENES IN FICTION OCCUR IN HIS BOOKS

HE KEEPS THINGS INCREDIBLY REAL THE HEROES NEVER WIN ALL THE WAY NOT THAT THEY'RE TRADITIONAL HEROES ANYHOW BUT THEY OFTEN FIND SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO AND I REALLY LOVE THE WAY SOME OF THESE SMALL PERSONAL TRIUMPHS CONTRAST WITH THE BIG BAD SYSTEMS THAT TEND TO SERVE AS THE ANTAGONISTIC FORCE OF HIS NOVELS

AND I STILL HAVE TWO OF HIS BOOKS LEFT TO READ I'M BASICALLY SAVING THEM FOR WHEN I NEED TO READ SOMETHING GUARANTEED GOOD EVEN THE MISFIRE OF BLEEDING EDGE WAS ENJOYABLE AND INTELLIGENT
WILLIAM FAULKNER BECAUSE I FIND HIS WORK GROWS WITH YOU OVER THE YEARS
TIMOTHY ZAHN

I'LL ALWAYS LOVE WRITING AND BOOKS BUT WHEN I HAVE TO PICK AN ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ZAHN IS IT HIS STORIES HAVE AN INCREDIBLE WAY OF GIVING YOU ALL THE PIECES BUT PRESENTING THEM JUST SO SO THAT YOU DON'T PUT THEM TOGETHER IN THE RIGHT ORDER THEN THE END HITS AND IT ALL FALLS INTO PLACE IN A RUSH AND YOU'RE FLOORED

CRUD THE GUY GIVES YOU A MYSTERY IN THE ICARUS HUNT THAT YOU CAN SOLVE ABOUT TO INTO THE BOOK I'VE ONLY EVER MET ONE PERSON WHO FIGURED IT OUT BEFORE THE BIG REVEAL A MASTER OF THE MISDIRECT ABSOLUTELY THRILLING TO READ HIS STUFF AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON
MY FAVORITES ARE LIKE SHIFTING SANDS ANYWAY I'LL GIVE A FEW PRITCHETT TZOLKIN AND PHILIP KING DICK ALL COMES TO MIND PRITCHETT AS HE CAN BE GENTLE FUNNY AND WISE TZOLKIN IS DEEP ENTHRALLING AND GRAND PHILIP KING DICK IS MINDBENDING PROVOKING BEFUDDLING AND ADDICTIVE
STEPHEN KING NO OTHER AUTHOR HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAKE ME FEEL SO MANY EMOTIONS WITH THEIR WRITING EXCEPT FOR GEORGE RR MARTIN I RECENTLY READ IT AND HE'D HAVE ME LAUGHING WITH THE LOSERS CLUB ONE MINUTE SPITTING WITH FURY AT BEVERLY S DAD AND FEELING STRAIGHT UP TERRIFIED WHENEVER PENNYWISE APPEARED

ALTHOUGH NO OTHER BOOK HAS MADE ME FEEL SO TENSE AND ANXIOUS THAN MISERY

HIS DIALOGUE IS CONSISTENTLY BRILLIANT AND REALISTIC HE HAS A FANTASTIC WAY OF GETTING INTO A CHARACTERS MIND AND MAKING THEM JUMP OFF THE PAGE EVEN THOUGH SHE TERRIFIES THE LIFE OUT OF ME ANNIE WILKES IS ONE OF HIS BEST CHARACTERS AND SO WELL WRITTEN
DON WINSLOW I JUST LOVE HIM
MATT HAIG

I JUST FIND HIS WRITING SO ELEGANT WHAT I'VE READ OF HIS BOOKS THEY'RE ALWAYS DISCUSSING ALMOST PHILOSOPHICAL THINGS IN THE FORM OF WELL WRITTEN FICTION BOOKS
I HAVE TO GO WITH ALEXANDRE DUMAS

I COULD MONTECRISTO AND THE THREE MUSKETEERS EVERY YEAR
WILLA CATHER I ENJOY HOW HER CHARACTERS EXPRESS DEEP EMOTIONS IN SUCH UNIVERSALLY RELATABLE WAYS HER WRITING IS SO FLUID AND DETAILED AND THE CHARACTERS DYNAMIC I WOULD RANK HER AS ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICAN WRITERS EVER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED HER WORK
EMILE GABORIAU BEST EVER BUT SMALL SELECTION INFLUENCED A CONAN DOYLE A LOT
MY GIRLFRIEND SHE'S AN ENGLISH STUDENT AND SHE WRITES IN HER OWN TIME SHE HAS DONE MAINLY FAN FICTION SO FAR BUT IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A GREAT BOOK WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR SO REALLY IMPRESSIVE AND GRIPPING THIS COMES FROM AN AVID READER NOT JUST A BOYFRIEND WHEN SHE PUBLISHES HER BOOK I'LL LET YA ALL KNOW
JUST GET THE NORTON SHAKESPEARE IT SKULLFUCKS YOU WITH INFINITE KNOWLEDGE
I'VE ALWAYS HATED LITHIUM AND MANY OF THEIR ARTICLES ARE PARTICULARLY LOW-QUALITY AND ENTIRELY BASED ON UNPROVEN ASSUMPTION THIS IS ONE OF THEM

A TRUCKLOAD OF LATIN AMERICAN AUTHORS WERE PUBLISHED LONG BEFORE DEATH MADE HIM POPULAR THE AUTHOR BLATANTLY IGNORES LATIN AUTHOR'S THAT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE IN TRANSLATION FOR DECADES AND ARE LIKE MARIO VARGAS LLOSA

NOT A SINGLE THING STATED IN THE ARTICLE SHOWS ANY CORRELATION BETWEEN BOLAN BEING TRANSLATED AND AN INCREASE IN WORKS IN TRANSLATION BY OTHER LATIN AMERICAN AUTHORS

BOLZANO INFLUENCED THE TRAJECTORY OF THE PUBLICATION OF LATIN AMERICAN LITERATURE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS MOST NOTABLY HE OPENED PUBLISHING CHANNELS BY DRAWING READERS ATTENTION TO OTHER WRITERS IN PLACES LIKE CHILE MEXICO AND ARGENTINA HE ALSO HELPED TURN ENGLISH READERS ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE LATIN AMERICAN BOOKS OF THE AND AND BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MODERNISTS AND REALISTS OF THE BOOM

THIS IS JUST BLATANTLY NOT TRUE AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT

I'M NO LITERARY EXPERT BUT I FOUND THAT HOUSE HETP OF LEAVES NEEDS TO BE READ WITH A GRAIN OF SUGAR WHATEVER THE OPPOSITE OF SALT IS THE BOOK PLAYS WITH CONVENTIONS ABOUT REALITY AS A RUNNING THEME IT EXPECTS CERTAIN ACCOMMODATIONS FROM THE READER TRYING TO LAY OUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE OVERARCHING STORY IN A NICE NEAT ROW IS AN EXERCISE IN FRUSTRATION I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW HOW YOUR PRACTICALLY REQUIRED SECOND READING GOES FOR YOU
CONGRATS ON THE READ IT'S A BOOK UNLIKE ANY OTHER I WASN'T SOLD ON THE FOOTNOTES APPENDICES AT FIRST BUT I CAME AROUND ESPECIALLY AS THE TRUANT STORY PROGRESSED I READ THE BOOK ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO AND I STILL HAVE MANY OF THE SAME UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AS YOU
HOW DID YOU INTERPRET THE META PLOT AT THE END WHERE NAVY IS READING HOUSE OF LEAVES BEFORE THE DOCUMENTARY THE BOOK IS BASED ON IS EVEN FINISHED

I'VE READ HOUSE OF LEAVES TWICE AND I DON'T REMEMBER THIS HAPPENING AT ALL
DID YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE ALL OF THE FOOTNOTES AND APPENDICES HELPED YOU OR HINDERED YOU IN FEELING INVESTED IN THE BOOK

THE PART WITH HIS MOM WRITING ALL THE LETTERS AND HER SAYING SHED PUT A CHECK MARK ON THEM AND THEN A CHECK MARK SHOWED UP LATER DOWN THE LINE IN THE ACTUAL STORY WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE PIECE OF HORROR IN A BOOK IVE EVER READ THAT SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT FORGET WHY YOU ARE READING THE BOOK FOR PLEASURE DON'T LET YOURSELF GET HUNG UP CATCHING EVERY FOOTNOTE OR HIDDEN MESSAGE DON'T GET CAUGHT UP TRYING TO COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND ALL OF JOHNNY TRUANTS RAMBLINGS I TRIED THIS AT FIRST AND THE BOOK BECAME A TEDIOUS SLOG FINALLY I SAID SCREW IT AND FOUND THAT I ENJOYED IT MUCH MORE
BUSTS INTO THIS THREAD LIKE THE KOOL AID MAN

THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK EVER I LOVE TALKING ABOUT IT OME FAIR WARNING I HAVE READ IT MULTIPLE TIMES AT LEAST FIVE OR SIX OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS

DID YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE ALL OF THE FOOTNOTES AND APPENDICES HELPED YOU OR HINDERED YOU IN FEELING INVESTED IN THE BOOK

MY OPINION VARIES DEPENDING ON THE THE FIRST TIME I LOATHED JOHNNY AND THOUGHT HIS FOOTNOTES WERE DISTRACTING AND GROSS THE SECOND TIME AROUND I ONLY READ THE DAVIDSON RECORD WHICH WAS GOOD IN ITS OWN RIGHT BUT LATER ON I FOUND I MISSED THE JOHNNY FRAME STORY A FEW YEARS LATER I WENT FROM HATING JOHNNY TO FEELING DEEPLY SORRY FOR HIM HE WAS SO CLEARLY FABRICATING SO MANY ASPECTS OF HIS LIFE THAT I STARTED QUESTIONING EVERYTHING HE TOLD ME AND HE SEEMED A LOT SADDER THAN HE DID THE FIRST TIME AROUND

I ALSO READ SOMEWHERE ONCE THAT IF YOU DO SOME DECRYPTION WORK FROM THE LETTERS FROM HIS MOTHER THERE'S A SECRET MESSAGE THAT SPELLS OUT MY DEAR ZAMPINO WHO DID YOU LOSE I NEVER TRIED IT OUT MYSELF SO I DON'T KNOW HOW ACCURATE IT IS BUT EVER SINCE THEN I'VE ENTERTAINED THE POSSIBILITY THAT JOHNNY WAS ZAMPINO AND THE ENTIRE THING EVEN THE DAVIDSON RECORD WAS A FIGMENT OF HIS TROUBLED IMAGINATION

HOW DID YOU INTERPRET THE META PLOT AT THE END WHERE NAVY IS READING HOUSE OF LEAVES BEFORE THE DOCUMENTARY THE BOOK IS BASED ON IS EVEN FINISHED

HA I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I READ THE BOOK AND GOT TO THAT PART I ALMOST THREW IT OUT THE WINDOW BECAUSE I WAS LIKE HOW CAN THIS BOOK EXIST IN MY HANDS IF NAVY IS READING IT

OVER TIME I'VE STARTED TO SUSPECT THAT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE HOUSE WARP REALITY TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR NAVY TO EXIST BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE BOOK AT THE SAME TIME

LASTLY JOHNNY TALKS AT THE END ABOUT SOME PEOPLE HAVING READ THE COMPLETED BOOK WHERE SHOULD WE ASSUME THIS BOOK ENDED IN OUR BOOK

THAT PART ALWAYS GAVE ME A FEELING TOO I THINK PERHAPS JOHNNY IS JUST PROJECTING AT THAT POINT WISHING THE MESS HE'S BEEN TRYING TO FIT TOGETHER HAS ACTUALLY BEEN FINISHED AND WELL-RECEIVED BUT I DON'T HAVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER FOR THAT ONE OR ANY OF THEM REALLY WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT THE BOOK IS HOW EVERY TIME I READ IT I COME AWAY WITH A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN IT
I REMEMBER READING SOME THEORY ABOUT PELAFINA BEING THE SOLE AUTHOR OF ALL OF THE STORIES THAT JOHNNY TRUANT DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXIST OR IS NOT THE TRUANT WHO WROTE THE STORIES
SOMETHING LIKE THAT I REMEMBER REALLY LIKING THE BOOK MORE AFTER READING THAT PARTICULAR THEORY
FIRST OFF LET ME SUGGEST YOU STOP BY THE MAD FORUMS A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN QUITE A BIT OF INTERESTING STUFF THERE

AS FOR NAVY READING HOL AND ENTRY ABOUT THE BAND WITH A FIRST EDITION COPY OF THE BOOK I THINK THOSE QUESTIONS HAVE THE SAME ANSWER CIRCLE ROUND A STONE PUBLICATIONS YOU'LL FIND THAT GROUPS NAME IN HOL WHEN JOHNNY LOOKS AT THE BANDS PRINT OUT THE INTERESTING PART IS CLASP GETS A NICE DOUBLE PAGE SPREAD AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH VOLUME OF HIS NEW SERIES THE FAMILIAR
ITS ALL ABOUT BEM

I SUGGEST THAT IF YOU WANT TO DIG DEEPER FOR ANSWERS FROM HOL YOU SHOULD FIRST LOOK TO THE REST OF WORKS PRIMARILY CLIP ALL THE LIGHTS OF MIDNIGHT AND THE FAMILIAR
WAS IT THE BEST BOOK YOU'VE EVER READ EVER PLEASE SAY YES BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST BOOK YOU'VE EVER READ EVER
IF SOMETHING CAN STOP YOU FROM WRITING A BOOK LET IT SOME GUY
I LOVE SEEING VIDEOS OF KNAUSGAARD BECAUSE THEY REVEAL THE MORE HUMAN PART OF HIS CHARACTER BECAUSE HIS WRITING IN MY STRUGGLE IS SO BRUTALLY HONEST YOU SOMETIMES GET AN IMAGE OF HIM AS BEING NOT A NICE GUY BUT THEN YOU HEAR HIM IN INTERVIEWS AND YOU SEE THAT WHILE HE IS VERY ANALYTICAL IT ISN'T NECESSARILY IN A COLD OR INSENSITIVE WAY

MAKES ME READ HIS BOOKS IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT
ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WEBSITE CATCH WAS BANNED IN STRONGSVILLE OH BUT THE SCHOOL ACTION WAS OVERTURNED IN BY A U SOUTH DISTRICT COURT IN MINARCINI VERB STRONGSVILLE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT CHALLENGED AT THE DALLAS TX INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN SNOQUALMIE WA BECAUSE OF ITS SEVERAL REFERENCES TO WOMEN AS WHORES
JUST SO EVERYONE IS CLEAR IT WAS BANNED IN AND THE BAN WAS OVERTURNED IN I ACTUALLY WENT TO STRONGSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL AND WATCHED CATCH THE MOVIE IN ONE OF MY CLASSES THERE QUITE A FEW YEARS AFTER THE BAN I DEFINITELY DID A DOUBLE TAKE WHEN I SAW THAT HEADLINE
I FEEL LIKE WHEN THEY TOLD JOSEPH HELLER ABOUT THIS THAT HE JUST LAUGHED AND LAUGHED
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS

EDIT AT LEAST I DID UNTIL THE DECISION WAS OVERTURNED IN

NOT SO TIMELY WITH THE POST THERE OP
I CAN'T TELL IF THIS WAS EARLY INDICATIONS OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS OR JUST PLAIN STUPIDITY INDEED I'M NOT SURE IF THE TWO ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE ANYMORE IF EVER
I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE READING AND PONDERING ON THIS SERIES FROM WASTELANDS TO WIZARD GLASS WAS A HELL OF A WAIT
THERE'S A PAPERBACK SET UP COMING OUT VERY SOON BUT IT'S SUPER EXPENSIVE

CHECK ANY USED BOOKSTORE AND YOU CAN FIND PLENTY OF HIS HARDCOVERS
FAIRLY SURE IT DOESN'T EXIST NOT IN HARDCOVER
THE CLOSEST I CAN THINK OF IS THE HARDCOVERS TO THE MARVEL GRAPHIC NOVEL SERIES THAT ADAPTS THE STORY UP TO A POINT I BELIEVE
THANKS FOR ALL THE INFORMATION I THINK I'LL BOTHER MY LOCAL BOOKSTORE AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE IT MOVE MY WAY UP TO BIGGER STORES
IF YOU READ ON A KINDLE DREADER OR KINDLE APP WINDOWS MAC IOS IPHONE IPAD ANDROID YOU CAN HIGHLIGHT ANY WORD AND IT WILL POP-UP THE DEFINITION

AND THE KINDLE CAN BE SET TO REMEMBER WORDS YOU'VE LOOKED UP AND PROVIDE FLASH CARDS LATER USING THE VOCABULARY BUILDER FEATURE

I DON'T KNOW YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION WHETHER ENGLISH IS A SECOND LANGUAGE OR IT IS A FIRST LANGUAGE BUT YOU STILL LACK CERTAIN VOCABULARY OFTEN USED IN WRITING I DON'T IF THAT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE IN YOUR ULTIMATE APPROACH BUT THE APPROACH BELOW IS THE ONE I USED IN LEARNING A 2ND LANGUAGE AND IT WORKS QUITE WELL

CHOOSE A CHUNK OF MATERIAL THAT IS RELATIVELY SHORT A FEW PAGES MAYBE A CHAPTER OR HALF A CHAPTER

2 ON FIRST READING JUST PLOW STRAIGHT THROUGH IT DO NOT STOP AND LOOK UP ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE CONFUSED BUT ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST TO FIGURE OUT THE MEANING OF SPECIFIC WORDS AND THE GENERAL GIST FROM CONTEXT READ WITH A PENCIL IN HAND AND MARK EVERY WORD YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND WITH A DOT

THIS DOES SEVERAL THINGS

SAVES TIME YOU'RE JUST PLOWING STRAIGHT FORWARD THROUGH THE MATERIAL WITHOUT STOPPING FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT TO MAKE THE OCCASIONAL DOT

FIGURING OUT MEANING OF WORDS VIA CONTEXT IS WHAT THE MOST FLUENT READERS TO SO YOU WANT TO CONSCIOUSLY PRACTICE THAT FORCE YOURSELF TO GUESS WHAT YOU THINK THE MEANING OF UNKNOWN WORDS IS FROM CONTEXT EVEN IF THIS SOMETIMES OFTEN TURNS OUT TO BE WRONG LATER TRUST THE FORCE LUKE IE YOU ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE THAN YOU THINK JUST FROM CONTEXT ALLOW THAT PROCESS TO HAPPEN

THIS WHOLE PROCESS SETS UP THE PARADIGM OF I WONDER WHAT THIS MEANS I NEED TO KNOW THIS IT IS IMPORTANT IN YOUR MIND THAT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR STARTING THE PROCESS OF REMEMBERING THE VOCABULARY AND WHAT IT MEANS THIS PROCESS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO DEVELOPING STRONG MEMORIES AND IT NEEDS TO UNFOLD OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IN ORDER FOR THE MEMORIES TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF STICKING

AGAIN IT IS OK TO BE CONFUSED ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE CONFUSED YOU WILL BECOME IN DUE TIME AND ALLOWING YOURSELF TO BE CONFUSED IS THE VERY IN THE LEARNING PROCESS

WRITE DOWN THE UNKNOWN WORDS AND PUT THEM ON A LIST YOU COULD TYPE THEM INTO A COMPUTER PUT THEM ON FLASHCARDS USE AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM WHATEVER I JUST WROTE THEM DOWN IN A LITTLE NOTEBOOK I CARRIED EVERYWHERE NOWADAYS I MIGHT KEEP THEM IN A GOOGLE DOC OR SOMETHING

PICK AND CHOOSE A BIT AMONG ALL THE NUMEROUS WORDS YOU HAVE MARKED WITH A DOT AS YOU READ TRY TO CHOOSE ONLY THE MOST IMPORTANT WORDS TO ADD TO YOUR ONES YOU HAVE SEEN A FEW TIMES NOW THE ONES THAT ARE ESPECIALLY KEY TO MEANING ETC A LITTLE SELECTION PROCESS HELPS EMPHASIZE TO YOURSELF THAT THE ONES YOU FINALLY DO CHOOSE ARE IMPORTANT WHICH AGAIN IS A KEY TO THE MEMORY PROCESS

IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO LEARN A FEW KEY WORDS WELL THAN TRY TO DOWN A FIREHOUSE OF NEW WORDS AND NONE OF THEM STICK IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY LEARN NEW WORDS EVERY DAY YOUR VOCABULARY WOULD BE NOTICEABLY IMPROVED IN MONTHS AND AMAZINGLY IMPROVED IN YEARS I WOULDN'T PUT DOWN MORE THAN MAYBE NEW WORDS ON MY BIGGEST DAYS AND MAYBE MORE ON AVERAGE AGAIN THAT MEANS YOU MUST PICK AND THIS FILTERING PROCESS IS THE FIRST AND IN MANY WAYS MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN THE LEARNING PROCESS FOR THE NEW VOCABULARY

NOW GET YOUR LIST OF NEW WORDS LOOK THOSE WORDS UP AND JOT DOWN A DEFINITION AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE WORD IE HOW TO FORM PLURALS VERB TENSES OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT USING THE WORD

STRONGLY SUGGEST SUMMARIZING THE KEY POINTS OF THE DEFINITION IN YOUR OWN WORDS NOT JUST COPY PASTING FROM THE DICTIONARY YOU DON'T NEED THE ENTIRE DICTIONARY DEFINITION JUST ENOUGH TO REMIND YOU OF WHAT THE WORD MEANS AGAIN REFORMING IDEAS IN YOUR OWN WORDS AND SUMMARIZING THEM FOR YOURSELF IS A VITAL STEP IN THE LEARNING PROCESS COPY PASTE IS QUICK BUT LITERALLY DOES NOTHING TO HELP YOU LEARN

REVIEW THE LIST OF WORDS A TIME OR TWO IN MY LITTLE NOTEBOOK I WOULD READ THROUGH THE LIST A TIME OR TWO THEN COVER UP THE WORD TRY TO GUESS IT FROM THE DEFINITION THEN ALSO COVER UP THE DEFINITION TRY TO GIVE IT FROM THE WORD

NOW GO BACK READ THE SECTION CHAPTER OF THE BOOK AND YOUR READING WILL GO MUCH FASTER THIS TIME AND YOU'LL FIND YOU ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND IT QUITE WELL THIS TIME AROUND EVEN IF YOU DON'T QUITE REMEMBER SOME OF THE WORDS YET A QUICK GLANCE AT YOUR LIST FOR THE SHAKY ONES AND YOU ARE ALL SET

SEEMS LIKE A GIANT WASTE OF TIME BUT IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY NEEDING TO STOP AND LOOK UP THAT MANY WORDS BELIEVE ME YOU ARE MISSING A BIG CHUNK OF WHAT IS GOING ON EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE STOPPING TO LOOK SOME WORDS UP YOU'LL FIND THAT KNOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND SPECIFIC KEY WORDS IS VERY REWARDING AND YOU WILL START TO UNDERSTAND MANY THINGS YOU MAY HAVE MISSED THE FIRST TIME AROUND

NOW YOU HAVE A SHEET OF NEW WORDS YOU HAVE LEARNED TODAY THAT YOU KEEP TOGETHER WITH ALL OF YOUR OTHER DAILY WORD SHEETS OR FLASHCARDS OR GOOGLE DOCS OR WHATEVER SYSTEM YOU USE OLDER SHEETS GET REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AGAIN COVER THE WORD GUESS THE DEFINITION AND THEN DO THE REVERSE MAYBE ONCE A DAY FOR A WHILE THEN ONCE EVERY TWO DAYS THEN ONCE A WEEK THEN ONCE A MONTH THEN MAYBE ONCE A YEAR

I LIKE THE IDEA OF KEEPING TOGETHER THE WORDS YOU LEARNED WHILE READING ON A CERTAIN DAY OR READING A CERTAIN BOOK BECAUSE WHEN I GO BACK REVIEW THE OLD WORDS IT IS NOT JUST A WORD IN SPLENDID ISOLATION NOW INSTEAD I REMEMBER CLEARLY THE BOOK I FIRST READ THAT WORD IN WHAT THE CONTEXT WAS WHAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT WORD WAS TO THE BOOK ETC ETC ETC AGAIN CONTEXT IS THE KEY TO MEMORY SO SAVING A BIT OF THAT CONTEXT IN YOUR WORD LISTS IS VERY VERY PROFITABLE IN TERMS OF LEARNING AND RETAINING VOCABULARY

SO I KEEP ALL THE WORD LISTS I HAVE GENERATED IN ONE NOTEBOOK KEPT IN THE ORDER I LEARNED THEM ANOTHER KEY BIT OF PERSONAL CONTEXT AND ALL TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER WORDS I LEARNED FROM THAT PARTICULAR BOOK OR ARTICLE AND WHEN I REVIEW I'LL GENERALLY REVIEW ALL THE WORDS ON PAGE PAGE BRINGING THAT WHOLE CONTEXT BACK TO MIND AS I REVIEW THE WORD

AFTER FOLLOWING THIS GENERAL PROCESS FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS I FOUND I COULD READ NEWSPAPERS IN MY FOREIGN LANGUAGE WITHOUT NEEDING TO LOOK UP TOO MANY WORDS

LATER I FOLLOWED A SIMILAR PROCESS FOR MORE LITERARY BOOKS WE READ AS PART OF COLLEGE COURSES IN THAT LANGUAGE AGAIN AFTER JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS OF DOING THIS PRETTY INTENSIVELY I FOUND I COULD SUDDENLY JUST READ THOSE KINDS OF BOOKS WITHOUT FEELING I NEEDED TO STOP LOOK UP EVERY 5TH WORD I STILL FOLLOWED THE PROCESS WITH MY LITTLE NOTEBOOK BUT I WOULD END UP A SHORT STORY WITH SAY NEW WORDS NOT AS USUALLY HAPPENED IN THE BEGINNING

RECENTLY I FOLLOWED THE SAME GENERALLY PROCESS AGAIN AFTER ALMOST YEARS NOT SPEAKING THAT LANGUAGE MUCH AND ONCE AGAIN AFTER MONTHS OF THIS PROCESS I CAN PRETTY WELL FOLLOW FOREIGN LANGUAGE RADIO BROADCASTS WHILE BEING PUZZLED BY ONLY THE OCCASIONAL WORD NOT THE WHOLE THING
YOU COULD JOT THEM DOWN TO LOOK UP LATER I'VE READ CHALLENGING BOOKS WHERE I MAKE A VOCABULARY LIST INSIDE THE FRONT COVER I DON'T NECESSARILY LOOK UP THE WORDS RIGHT AWAY BUT I DO EVENTUALLY
AFTER A WHILE YOU GET MOST WORDS BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT A NEW ONE MEANS EITHER YOU LOOK IT UP OR JOT IT DOWN TO CHECK IT LATER NEXT TIME YOU'LL PROBABLY REMEMBER WHAT IT MEANS

IT HAPPENS LESS AND LESS OFTEN THE MORE YOU READ OVER TIME YOUR READING VOCABULARY JUST GROWS
THERE'S READING CRITICALLY AND READING FOR PLEASURE USUALLY PEOPLE READ A BOOK FOR PLEASURE

IF YOU ENJOY THE BOOK YOU CAN GO BACK THROUGH AND DO A COMPLEXIONIST RUN WHERE YOU KEEP A WORD LIST OF ALL THE WORDS YOU HAD TO LOOK UP AND THEN SPEND MINUTES EACH DAY REVIEWING THAT LIST NOT ONLY IS VOCABULARY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO HISTORY AND CONTEXT THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF OUTSIDE RESEARCH YOU CAN DO ON THE TIME PERIOD SUCH TO GET A BETTER PICTURE OF THE STORY YOU CAN ALSO OUTLINE EVERY CHAPTER AND TRY TO PIECE TOGETHER WHY THE AUTHOR TOLD WHAT PARTS WHERE HOW HE DID IT
I SOMETIME LOOK THE WORDS UP ONLINE VISUALIZE THEM AND THE SENTENCE THEY ARE IN AND REALLY PLAY THAT OUT LIKE A MOVIE IN MY MIND I WAS ALSO GIVEN A KINDLE FOR XMAS A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT HAS MADE MY VOCABULARY SO MUCH STRONGER
TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE WORD BY USING THE WORDS AND SENTENCES AROUND THE UNKNOWN WORD THIS IS CALLED USING CONTEXT CLUES IF YOU STILL CAN NOT FIGURE IT OUT KEEP YOUR PHONE NEARBY AND USE
THIS WILL GIVE YOU THE WORD MEANINGS AND SYNONYMS
KEEP READING YOUR VOCABULARY WILL INCREASE AND THOSE WORDS YOU HAVE A HARD TIME REMEMBERING WILL BE REMEMBERED AFTER COMING ACROSS THEM TIMES BEST OF LUCK
HOPE THAT CONTEXT IS ENOUGH I MEAN THAT'S HOW I LEARN A LOT OF WORDS THEN AGAIN I JUST LEARNED I'VE BEEN USING PERUSE WRONG MY WHOLE LIFE I THOUGHT IT MEANT TO SORT OF GLANCE OVER BUT APPARENTLY IT MEANS TO STUDY INTENSELY OR REALLY IN DEPTH
PICK UP A DICTIONARY A BIG ONE READ IT COVER TO COVER

IF YOU SURVIVE YOU'LL HAVE A MUCH BIGGER VOCABULARY
USE GOOGLE VOICE SEARCH FOR THE WORD WAY YOU CAN KEEP READING REPEATING THE WORD A FEW TIMES HELPS ME WITH MEMORY
WELL ONE WAY WOULD BE TO START EXPANDING YOUR GENERAL VOCABULARY OUTSIDE OF READING

THERE IS A SPACED REPETITION PROGRAM FOR THE COMPUTER TABLETS PHONES CALLED ANDI YOU CAN DOWNLOAD CARD PACKS SAT OR GRE WORD LISTS FOR EXAMPLE AND LEARN THEM WITH JUST A SMALL DAILY COMMITMENT
AMAZON KINDLE APP HAS A DICTIONARY FEATURE IT WORKS WELL BUT MY ONLY GRIPE IS THAT NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE DICTIONARIES FOR SCIENTIFIC DEFINITIONS FOR MY SCI-FI READING AND STUFF BUT IT ALSO LINKS TO WIKIPEDIA

OR YOU COULD WRITE IT DOWN FOR LATER LOOKUP AND SIMPLY ATTEMPT TO FIGURE OUT THE WORD USAGE VIA CONTEXT
THIS MAY NOT BE THE ADVICE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT LEARN A ROMANCE LANGUAGE LIKE SPANISH ITALIAN OR FRENCH MY FIRST LANGUAGE GROWING UP WAS SPANISH AND I LIKED TO READ FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE IN ENGLISH AND I NOTICED THAT I INSTINCTIVELY KNEW WHAT MANY LONG TECHNICAL WORDS MEANT SINCE THEN I'VE REALIZED THAT THOSE WORDS OFTEN HAVE LATIN ORIGINS AND AS A ROMANCE LANGUAGE SPANISH IS DERIVED FROM LATIN FOR EXAMPLE THE WORD MALICIOUS I HAVE NEVER HAD TO LOOK UP THAT WORD BECAUSE THE WORD MAL MEANS BAD IN SPANISH SO I JUST ASSUMED MALICIOUS MEANT BAD IN SOME WAY AND I THEN I WOULD PUT MY ASSUMED DEFINITION INTO THE CONTEXT OF THE SENTENCE AND THEN KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANT
READ ON A DEVICE THAT GAS A DICTIONARY BUILT IN GOOGLE BOOKS LET'S YOU LONG PRESS FOR THE DEFINITION

FORGETTING WORDS WHO CARES IF THEY COME UP ENOUGH YOU'LL EVENTUALLY REMEMBER IF YOU NEVER HEAR THE WORD AGAIN WAS NOT VERY USEFUL ANYWAYS
ARE NICE IN THAT YOU CAN INSTANTLY LOOK UP WORDS

OTHER THAN THAT YOUR BEST BET IS TO JUST TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK UP THE WORDS THAT SIMPLE ACT WILL DO A LOT TO ENSURE YOU REMEMBER THE WORD IN THE FUTURE BUT IT'S NO GREAT SIN TO LOOK UP A WORD A SECOND TIME

OVER TIME YOUR BEST BET IS TO SIMPLY KEEP READING AND YOUR VOCABULARY WILL GROW NATURALLY
TRY TO APPARENTLY IT'S PRETTY FUN
I READ WITH A PENCIL AND CIRCLE ANY WORDS I DON'T KNOW AND COME BACK LATER TO LOOK THEM UP HOWEVER IF I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE SENTENCE WITHOUT LOOKING THE WORD UP PRETTY RARE THEN I'LL JUST LOOK IT UP AS I'M READING
GOOGLE
DELETED
DELETED
I LOVED THE WAY IT STARTS SMALL IF I REMEMBER IT RIGHTLY AND IT'S A LONG TIME AGO ONE MAN FINDS EVIDENCE OF WHAT THE LIGHTS IN THE SKY REALLY MEAN ON EARTH IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM MODERN INVASION BLOCKBUSTERS WHERE THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS FROM THE START THAT THERE'S BIG TROUBLE AHEAD I ALSO LOVED THE IDEA OF THE ENDING NO SPOILERS HERE WHEN THERE'S HELP FROM THE UNLIKELIEST OF SOURCES IT'S A STEP AHEAD OF MOST MODERN SCIENCE FICTION FANTASY WHEN PEOPLE MOVE FROM ONE PLANETARY TO ANOTHER WITH NEVER A SECOND THOUGHT FOR WHAT THEY MIGHT BE INGESTING

AND WHEN I FIRST READ IT I WAS A ASTONISHED THAT A WHOLE GENRE HAD BEEN INVENTED SO DAMN LONG AGO
APPARENTLY SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS ABOUT MARTIANS WERE ECHOES OF A THAT MARS WAS AN EMPIRE LOOKING TO CONQUER EARTH CONSIDERING THE TIME IT WAS PUBLISHED I GUESS IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE
I READ AN ANALYSIS A LONG TIME AGO SOURCE UNKNOWN THAT THOUGHT THE WAR OF THE WORLDS WAS WELLS REACTION TO THE HUBRIS THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL CONQUER ALL AND RENDER NATURE OBSOLETE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WAS YEARS STRONG AT THE POINT WELLS WROTE THIS BOOK AND THERE WAS A PREVAILING BELIEF THAT NATURE HAD BEEN CONQUERED

ALSO AN ANALYSIS OF THE FASCINATION IN THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC THE UNSINKABLE SHIP WHERE HUMANS GOT THEIR COMEUPPANCE FROM NATURE
AUTHORS WOULD PROBABLY TITLE IT

MARS A WAR BETWEEN TWO WORLDS

BOOK TITLING NEEDS TO HAVE A COLONECTOMY
WONDERFUL IT WILL MAKE VERY GOOD KINDLING FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEFT AFTER ITS REALISED THAT THE TIPPING POINT IS BEHIND US
IT DEPENDS COMPLETELY ON THE CONTENT AND MY MINDSET AT THE TIME SOME DAYS PAGES AN HOUR BECAUSE I'M DISTRACTED

OTHER DAYS I CAN READ A HELL OF A LOT MORE PAGES IN A WEEKEND EASILY
YEAH ABOUT I LOVE A BOOK THAT SLOWS ME DOWN BUT FEW DO
IT VARIES DEPENDING ON THE CONTENTION A BOOK OF DENSE LONGER SENTENCES OR CONTENT REQUIRING SOME THOUGHT WILL TAKE ME LONGER TO READ AS OPPOSED TO A BOOK OF LIGHTLY WRITTEN SHORT STORIES

I'VE NEVER MEASURED MY READING RATE SO I CAN'T GIVE ANY REAL NUMBERS ON IT THOUGH
ABOUT PAGES WE ARE TALKING MATCHBOX SIZE BOOKS WITH SIZE FONT RIGHT
I READ ANYWHERE BETWEEN AND THE MORE I READ THE FASTER I GOT
REALLY DEPENDS ON THE PAGE WHEN I WAS A KID WE AVERAGED THE WORDS PER PAGE IN HARRY POTTER AND LORD OF THE RING AND IN THE COPIES OUR SCHOOL LIBRARY HAD THEY WERE NOWHERE NEAR THE SAME I THINK THE LOAR COPY WE HAD WAS DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE NUMBER OF WORDS PER PAGE COMPARED TO THE HARRY POTTER BOOK

I READ ABOUT AN AVERAGE PAGE A MINUTE BACK THEN

SINCE I USE A KINDLE NOW THAT MEASURE HAS BECOME A BIT LESS MEANINGFUL I COULD DO THE MATH BUT IT'S A CURIOSITY AND I'M NOT THAT CURIOUS RIGHT NOW
IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH I EXPECT TO RETAIN IF I'M READING FOR PLEASURE AROUND PAGES AN HOUR IF I'M READING FOR SCHOOL WORK ETC USUALLY

MY RATE HAS STAYED FAIRLY CONSISTENT OVER THE YEARS ALTHOUGH IT'S PROBABLY DROPPED SOMEWHAT RECENTLY
COMPLETELY DEPENDS ON THE BOOK HEAVIER STUFF THAT CAUSES ME TO THINK MORE SLOWS ME DOWN WHILE BRAIN CANDY JUST FLIES RIGHT BY

I'D SAY I AVERAGE PAGES OR SO AN HOUR
I'M THE TYPE OF READER WHO ALMOST ALWAYS WILL TAKE A BREAK AT EVERY CHAPTER OF SECTION BREAK I FIND THE BREAKUP HELPS ME DIGEST WHAT I'M READING
DEPENDS ON THE BOOK REALLY REALLY I'D SAY AN AVERAGE OF A PAGE A MINUTE THOUGH
IT DEPENDS ON THE BOOK AVERAGE CASE PAGES PER HOUR IF IT'S A DIFFICULT BOOK OR SOMETHING THAT I NEED TO KNOW WELL I'LL SLOW DOWN AND DO MORE REVIEW AND
I'M NOT QUITE AS SLOW AS YOU BUT STILL PRETTY SLOW PROBABLY ABOUT PAGES AN HOUR IT DOES PUT ME OFF BOOKS THAT ARE TOO HEAVY ON DESCRIPTION
I READ VERY FAST ANYWHERE FROM PAGES HOUR FOR A LIGHT PAPERBACK COZY MYSTERY ETC TO HR ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES LONG RUSSIAN NAMES AND YES I READ A LOT BOOKS YEAR IN MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK THE STAFF MADE JOKE PREDICTIONS AS TO WHAT EVERYONE WOULD BE DOING IN YEARS MINE WAS THAT I WOULD HAVE READ ALL THE BOOKS IN THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESSIONAL
ABOUT
I NEVER READ WITHOUT MUSIC IN MY EARS AND PRINT SIZE MATTERS GREATLY BUT ABOUT DEPENDING ON THE PRINTING
I AM MUCH LIKE YOU FRIEND AROUND PAGES PER HOUR MAYBE FASTER IF IT'S A LIGHT READ I MADE A POST LIKE YOURS A WHILE BACK AND WAS ENCOURAGED BY SEVERAL TO NOT FOCUS SO MUCH ON HOW FAST I READ AND JUST TO ENJOY THE BOOK I STAND BY THAT ADVICE
HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX BY

I AM SO JEALOUS I DID MY FIRST READ WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT LITERALLY FINISHED IT WITHIN A DAY AND A HALF OF IT BEING RELEASED I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT IT I RUSHED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS I'VE REREAD IT SO MANY TIMES SINCE THEN BUT I DO WISH I COULD GO BACK AND TAKE IT SLOWER
NOW I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WHEN MY DAUGHTER SHE'S MONTHS OLD NOW WILL UNDERSTAND IT ENOUGH TO EXPERIENCE IT AGAIN WITH HER FIRST TIME THROUGH
THE HAMMER OF THOR BY RICK RIORDAN
ENJOYABLE BUT IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET INTO BECAUSE I'D FORGOTTEN ALL THE CHARACTERS FROM BOOK
THE GUIDE TO THE GALAXY BY DOUGLAS ADAMS
LOLITA VLADIMIR NABOKOV

ITS A HARD ONE FOR ME TO READ WITHOUT WINCING BUT THE WAY IN WHICH IT IS WRITTEN REALLY CAPTURES ME I LIKE TO EQUATE IT TO DRAWING A NICE CURVE ALL THE WORLDS FLOW INTO EACH OTHER SO BEAUTIFULLY THE CREATIVE USE OF LANGUAGE DOES SUCH A FANTASTIC JOB AT MAKING SUCH A DARK TOPIC SO POETIC
EVERY MAN DIES ALONE BY HANS FALLACIA
THE POWER BROKER ROBERT MOSES AND THE FALL OF NEW YORK BY ROBERT CARO

BETTERWORLDBOOKS HAS FREE SHIPPING AND A TICKER AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE SHOWING HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'VE DONATED TO CHARITIES AND HOW MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN DONATED TO LITERACY CAMPAIGNS THEY ALSO SELL SOME OF THEIR TITLES ON AMAZON 3RD PARTY SO IT'S EASY TO PRICE COMPARE

I ALSO LIKE FOR USED BOOKS THEY HAVE FLAT RATE ECONOMY SHIPPING FOR A SHIPMENT IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY
FREE SHIPPING ON ALL ORDERS
AMAZON BECAUSE I HAVE PRIME AND NOW I'M TOO USED TO 2 DAY SHIPPING
MOST BOOKS ARE AROUND
AMAZON ACTUALLY

I'M FROM GERMANY AND THE ENGLISH SECTION IN MOST BOOKSTORES IS UNFORTUNATELY VERY SMALL AND DOESN'T CARRY ANYTHING THAT'S NOT EITHER SUPER FAMOUS OR NEW
MORE SPECIFICALLY FOR COLLEGE TEXTBOOKS BUT
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AMAZING DEALS HETP IS PERFECT
BOUGHT NEARLY WORTH OF TEXTBOOKS FOR INCLUDING SHIPPING HANDLING
I USUALLY GO TO ABEBOOKS WHICH IS A MARKETPLACE FOR BOOKSELLERS AND OWNED BY AMAZON USUALLY HAVE A GOOD SELECTIONS AND GOOD PRICES WITH REASONABLE SHIPPING SINCE ALL OF THE SELLERS ARE COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER ON THERE JUST WATCH OUT FOR LIBRARY COPIES
I USED TO BUY MOST OF MY BOOKS ON BECAUSE THE STORES IN TOWN DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD SELECTION AND I'M NOT REALLY GOOD AT WAITING FOR STUFF NOW I MOVED TO THE NETHERLANDS AND FINDING STORES THAT CARRY ENGLISH BOOKS ISN'T AS EASY SO I MIGHT START USING BOOK
BOOK DEPOSITORY IS GREAT I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TOOK A WEEK TO RECEIVE MY ORDERS HERE IN AUSTRALIA
AMAZON SINCE I PRETTY MUCH JUST BUY THESE DAYS BUT IF YOU COUNT COMICS GRAPHIC NOVELS I USE INSTOCKTRADES FOR THOSE
WHEN BUYING PAPERBACKS I USED TO USE BOOKDEPOSITORY HOWEVER NOW THAT I SWITCHED TO KINDLE BOOKS IS UNBEATABLE PLUS PRICES ARE MUCH BETTER AS WELL
THEY USE THE USPS BOOK RATE AND I STILL GOT MY SHIPMENT IN LESS THAN FIVE DAYS
I HAVE ALWAYS USED BOOKDEPOSITORY BECAUSE OF ITS FREE SHIPPING WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I'M FROM CHILE AND SHIPPING CAN GET EXPENSIVE THE BAD THING IS THAT IT USED TO TAKE MONTH TO ARRIVE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS OK BECAUSE OF HOW FAR AWAY I AM BUT THE LAST ORDERS I MADE HAVEN'T ARRIVED AND IT'S BEEN A MONTH AND A HALF SO I'M ACTUALLY SUPER DISAPPOINTED AND I'M LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS NOW

EDIT SPELLING
I GET MOST OF MY YA BOOKS FROM BOOKOUTLET WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT ARE CHEAP BOOKS GOOD SHIPPING
ONLY ISSUES ARE THE SHIPPING COST
I MAINLY USE CORDERY HTTPS FOLLOWED BY BOOK DEPOSITORY HETP WHEN BUYING ONLINE AS I FIND THEY MOSTLY HAVE THE BEST PRICES PLUS FREE DELIVERY WITH NO MINIMUM ORDER VALUE

OCCASIONALLY I'LL OPT FOR THE BOOK PEOPLE ONCE IN A WHILE I'LL SPOT A GREAT DEAL ON AMAZON OR EBAY


I USE AMAZON FOR NEWER BOOKS AND THRIFTBOOKS FOR OLDER ONES
IS MY BEST KEPT SECRET AND THE ONLY REASON I STILL HAVE AN EBAY ACCOUNT
I SEARCH FOR THE TITLE I WANT INSTEAD OF STARTING WITH THE SELLER THE SAME SITES KEEP COMING UP LIKE THRIFTBOOKS I'VE BOUGHT FROM WHOEVER HAS THE BOOK I WANT AT THE LOWEST COST PRICE SHIPPING AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH SERVICE

BOOK DEPOSITORY AND BETTERWORLDBOOKS ARE GOOD AND THEY PROVIDE FREE SHIPPING BETTERWORLDBOOKS ALSO SELL SECONDHAND BOOKS AND THEY DONATE BOOKS TO CHARITIES GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR BOTH
M EMBERS OF LABOR UNIONS AND UNORGANIZED UNSKILLED WORKERS WILL SOONER OR LATER REALIZE THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT IS NOT EVEN TRYING TO PREVENT WAGES FROM SINKING OR TO PREVENT JOBS FROM BEING EXPORTED AROUND THE SAME TIME THEY WILL REALIZE THAT SUBURBAN WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS THEMSELVES DESPERATELY AFRAID OF BEING DOWNSIZED ARE NOT GOING TO LET THEMSELVES BE TAXED TO PROVIDE SOCIAL BENEFITS FOR ANYONE ELSE

AT THAT POINT SOMETHING WILL CRACK THE NONSUBURBAN ELECTORATE WILL DECIDE THAT THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED AND START LOOKING AROUND FOR A STRONGMAN TO VOTE FOR SOMEONE WILLING TO ASSURE THEM THAT ONCE HE IS ELECTED THE SMUG BUREAUCRATS TRICKY LAWYERS OVERPAID BOND SALESMEN AND POSTMODERNIST PROFESSORS WILL NO LONGER BE CALLING THE SHOTS

ONE THING THAT IS VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN IS THAT THE GAINS MADE IN THE PAST YEARS BY BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS AND BY HOMOSEXUALS WILL BE WIPED OUT JOCULAR CONTEMPT FOR WOMEN WILL COME BACK INTO FASHION ALL THE RESENTMENT WHICH BADLY EDUCATED AMERICANS FEEL ABOUT HAVING THEIR MANNERS DICTATED TO THEM BY COLLEGE GRADUATES WILL FIND AN OUTLET
MIND SAW RICK AND MORTY FOR SOME REASON
I READ IT AS THE BOOK ORGANIZED IT I'D READ THE FOOTNOTES AS THEY CAME UP AND FLIPPED TO THE APPENDICES WHEN I WAS DIRECTED THERE AS TEMPTING AS IT WAS TO JUST IGNORE THEM AND CARRY ON WITH THE STORY

THAT SAID I THINK THE ONLY FOOTNOTES THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE TO ME WERE THE NOTES FROM THE EDITORS AND FROM JOHNNY TRUANT
I READ A CHAPTER AND THEN WENT BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THAT CHAPTER TO READ FOOTNOTES WHEN THEY WENT ON FOR PAGES I GOT THROUGH THE HEART OF IT BUT COULDN'T PUSH THROUGH WHEN THE PAGES GO INSANE HAHA
I READ THE MAIN STORY OF THE HOUSE UNLESS IT WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE NARRATOR AND THEN I FOLLOWED THAT UNTIL THE END OF THE RANT AND CAME BACK

THIS TIME I'M READING THE MAIN STORY ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND THEN GOING BACK TO READ THE NARRATOR STORY I'M MOSTLY IGNORING THE CITATIONS IT HELPED WITH IMMERSION THE FIRST TIME BUT THERE'S JUST TOO MANY
I READ BOTH STORIES AS THEY CAME ALONG AND HONESTLY I WISH I HAD READ THEM SEPARATELY TAKING TIME FROM THE DAVIDSON RECORD PORTION TO READ ABOUT THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JOHNNY TRUANT DETRACTED FROM THE SPOOKINESS IF I READ THE BOOK AGAIN I AM GOING TO READ THE DAVIDSON RECORD ALL OF THE WAY THROUGH AND THEN GO BACK AND READ STORY
I READ THE BOOKS AS IT WAS ORGANIZED THE MAIN STORY AND STOPPING FOR FOOT NOTES I FEEL THIS WAS MEANT TO MAKE THE READER FEEL DISORIENTATED LIKE BEING IN A MAZE AND LOSING YOUR SENSE OF DIRECTION AND IT WORKED

MY SISTER OTOH HAS ADD AND COULDN'T DO IT
WITH MULTIPLE BOOKMARKS STARTED WITH THE MAIN NARRATIVE REACHED A STOPPING PLACE THEN WENT BACK MULTIPLE BOOKMARKS AND READ THE FOOTNOTES THEN THE FOOTNOTES ON FOOTNOTES
I READ IT ONCE DURING HIGH SCHOOL AND AGAIN FOR A COLLEGE CLASSICAL THE FIRST TIME I READ THROUGH IT LEISURELY AND SKIMMED THE FOOTNOTES THE SECOND TIME I WAS MORE IMMERSIVE OBVIOUSLY AND TOOK EXTENSIVE NOTES CONNECTING THE DIFFERENT NARRATIVES TOGETHER I GOT MUCH MORE OUT OF IT THE SECOND TIME READ THE FOOTNOTES
FROM COVER TO COVER UNLESS OTHERWISE INSTRUCTED I STOPPED FOR FOOTNOTES AND ALWAYS FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH BEFORE CONTINUING I PERSONALLY SAVED THE APPENDICES FOR LAST BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WHEN I WAS IN 3RD GRADE WE READ A BOOK CALLED THE MOUSE BUTCHER BY SMITH AT THE TIME I LOVED THE STORY AND ASKED MY PARENTS TO BUY IT WE WENT TO SEVERAL BOOKSTORES BUT COULD NOT FIND ANY BOOKS BY SMITH MY PARENTS STARTED ASKING ME IF I WAS SURE THAT WAS THE AUTHOR'S NAME AND I SAID YES BECAUSE I HAD ASKED MY TEACHER FOR THE INFORMATION MY DAD DECIDED TO SEE IF WE COULD ORDER IT AND ONE BOOKSTORE COULD ORDER BOOKS BY SMITH BUT THEY HAD NO LISTING FOR THE MOUSE BUTCHER

I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BOOK AFTER THAT UNTIL MY MOM CALLED ME A FEW YEARS AGO AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE FOR ME SHE HAD FOUND A COPY OF THE MOUSE BUTCHER IN A LOCAL THRIFT STORE I NOW HAVE IT PROUDLY ON MY BOOKSHELF AND IT ONLY TOOK YEARS
WHAT IS THAT ONE BOOK THAT YOU JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET IN YOUR LIBRARY

AS A REGULAR PUBLIC LIBRARY AND INTERLIBRARY LOAN USER I WAS CONFUSED BY THIS UNTIL I REALIZED YOU MEANT PERSONAL LIBRARY

I DON'T BUY BOOKS OFTEN AND I NEVER HUNT THEM DOWN BUT CONGRATS ON YOUR FIND
THE NOTEBOOKS OF EAST MASCULINE CIOBAN THE LAST WORK OF MY FAVORITE WRITER IT WAS TRANSLATED YOU CAN EVEN FIND A PICTURE OF THE COVER ONLINE BUT THOUGH IT WAS ANNOUNCED FOR PUBLICATION IT WAS NEVER ACTUALLY FOR SALE SEEMS A LOT OF WORK FOR NOTHING
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A WELL PRESERVED COPY OF WOLFS TOOTH BY G WISLER

I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT SINCE MY BOOK COLLECTION WAS TORCHED YEARS AGO AND STILL NO SUCH LUCK
I MEAN BBC JUST AIRED NW SO IT IS NOT TO SURPRISING THEY'RE GONNA DO MORE
THE RAT TEETH GUY HAD TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE THREE THAT LEFT ON THEIR OWN BUT DIDN'T GO WITH GROUP

I SEEM TO RECALL THINKING THAT THE CREATURE WANTED TO INSTILL FEAR IN HIS PREY BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER IT BEING IMPLICITLY STATED IT'S POSSIBLE THAT LIKE LADY SILENCE THE CREATURE KNEW WHAT ABOUT DESTINY AS WELL AND WAS HELPING TO PLAY IT OUT
SO ITS BEEN AWHILE SINCE IVE READ THE BOOK BUT FROM WHAT I REMEMBER SPOILERS ITS IMPLIED THAT THE THING IS NOT JUST AN ANIMAL BUT A SPIRIT OF ESKIMO MYTHOLOGY OF SOME SORT WHICH I TOOK AS HAVING ACTUAL INTELLIGENCE AND IT ENJOYED HUNTING AND MENTALLY SCREWING WITH ITS PREY OR THE AUTHOR WAS JUST BEING DRAMATIC FOR DRAMA SAKE I DONT REMEMBER THE HODGSON PART BUT IF ITS AT THE PART I THINK IT IS I WOULD IMAGINE ITS BECAUSE CROZIER WAS A LITTLE DISTRACTED MIGHT OF FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE WHOLE THING WITH ENSURING THE CREWS SURVIVAL NOT FREEZING TO DEATH NOT STARVING TO DEATH AND AVOIDING MUTINEERS THE MAN WITH THE RAT TEETH I DONT FULLY REMEMBER SORRY THATS NOT SUPER HELPFUL I LOVE THE BOOK AND HAVENT FOUND MANY PEOPLE TO TALK TO ABOUT IT IF YOU LIKED SIMMONS YOU SHOULD DEFENCE READ THE HYPERION CANTOS ITS KIND OF A CIRCLEJERK RECOMMENDATION ON THIS SUB BUT ITS DAMN GOOD
NO IT'S MY BIRTHDAY
I LIKED THE CATCHER IN THE RYE TOO
CONGRATS THIS IS THE POST THAT MADE ME FINALLY UNDUB FROM THIS SUBREDDIT
WOW SHE READS SHE IS LIKE SMARTS AND STUFF
HOW WEIRD CURRENTLY STUDYING DYSTOPIA IN ENGLISH LIT AT HIGH SCHOOL AND I JUST STARTED CONSIDER PHLEGYAS YESTERDAY I AGREE IT'S GREAT GOOD TO GET A VIEW OF AN AUTHORS VISION OF AN IDEAL SOCIETY ALTHOUGH I'M GUESSING THE CULTURE ISN'T QUITE AS SIMPLE AS THAT REALLY ENJOYING IT DEFINITELY GOING TO GET INTO THE SERIES
IAIN M BANKS WAS SUCH A GREAT WRITER HE DIED FAR TOO YOUNG
JUST MAKE SURE THEY DON'T INCLUDE THE WASP FACTORY THAT BOOK IS STRANGE
WHILE THE CULTURE ON THE SURFACE IS A PERFECT OPEN SUCCESSFUL AND HAPPY SOCIETY THEY DO HAVE A DARK SIDE CONSIDER PHLEGYAS USE OF WEAPONS AND LOOK TO WINDWARD HAVE SOME SERIOUSLY DARK MOMENTS
ALAS BABYLON WHILE LEARNING THE COLD WAR AND ORYX AND CRAKE BECAUSE OF REASONS I WON'T SPOIL THE PLOT FOR

TOO MANY GREAT BOOKS THERE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE A SUGGESTED READING LIST FOR KIDS WHO WANT TO DIVE DEEPER INTO ANY GIVEN TOPIC
CONSIDER PHLEGYAS

I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT AND IF PARENTS COMPLAIN THEN ASK THEM WHY THEY ACCEPT SHAKESPEARE WITH ALL ITS ANTISEMITISM RACISM VIOLENCE FOUL LANGUAGE RAPE MURDER INCEST AND SO ON WITHOUT COMPLAINT I MADE THAT ARGUMENT YEARS AGO WHEN MY KID SISTERS HIGH SCHOOL TRIED TO KICK HER FOR THE DAY FOR WEARING A NIRVANA SHIRT HEH I STARTED RIFLING OFF LINES OF SHAKESPEARE PASSED THE PHONE TO MY FATHER WHO SAID PULL ONE PULL THE OTHER OR WE'LL SEE YOU IN COURT THE MATTER WAS QUIETLY DROPPED THE TEACHER WHO COMPLAINED WAS DISCIPLINED
WELL CONSIDERING THE STATE OF EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW THE TALE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS
CULTURE DEFINITELY SHOULD BE DISCUSSED IN SCHOOLS AND FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS

IT IS A GREAT STARTING POINT ON THE DESIRABILITY OF UTOPIAS DEFINED BY OUR CURRENT DESIRES CULTURE IS CLEARLY A SERIES DEFINED BY BANKS RELATIONSHIP TO BOTH HIS CONSERVATIVE UPBRINGING FATHER IN THE MILITARY AND THE THATCHER ERA IN BRITAIN THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IS A WET DREAM OF A YOUNG LEFTIST COLLEGE STUDENT AND IT IS A GENUINELY IMPORTANT QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD ASPIRE TO IT IS VERY EASY TO ANSWER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND THEN REALIZE HOW WRONG YOU ARE ONCE YOU START TAKING APART THE DETAILS EVEN BANKS SEEMS TO INDICATE AS MUCH IN HIS LATER SLIGHTLY MORE MATURE NOVELS

ANOTHER IMPORTANT AND INTERESTING TOPIC IS THE SEEMING HMM POINTLESSNESS OF CULTURE THERE'S NO REAL REASON FOR THE ENTIRE HUMANOID CIVILIZATION TO EXIST IS IT THEREFORE JUST A PLOT DEVICE IT OBVIOUSLY IS BUT THAT WOULD END THE INTERESTING DISCUSSION HERE AND NOW OR IS IT PERHAPS SOMETHING ELSE PERHAPS AN ULTIMATE DYSTOPIA WHERE THE CAPTURED CAN'T EVEN REALIZE THEY ARE BEING USED THINK THE FIRST IDEAL MATRIX CULTURE AS A UTOPIAN DYSTOPIA IS AN INTERESTING CONCEPT WHETHER IT IS HUMAN ZOO OR SOMETHING MORE SINISTER OR ENTIRELY ALIEN AND AMORAL

THEN THERE ARE SOME GENUINELY INTERESTING CONCEPTS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE STORIES INTERVENTION INTELLIGENCE FIRST CONTACT RULES OF SOCIETY ETC GENERALLY I THINK SCIENCE FICTION OF ANY KIND IS A MUCH BETTER MATERIAL FOR CREATIVE AND PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION THAN REGULAR LITERATURE AND WE SHOULD HAVE MORE OF IT IN SCHOOLS THE MORE THE BETTER AND TELL THE DEFENDERS OF ONE TRUE APPROVED STANDARD OF MORALITY TO FUCK OFFICIAL

HOWEVER PLAYER OF GAMES IS A REALLY WEAK BOOK WITH SIMPLISTIC AND NAIVE PLOT AND A VERY MORALIZING IT IS EASILY THE WORST OF ALL THE SERIES AS FAR AS ITS INTELLECTUAL POTENTIAL GOES I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY PEOPLE LOVE IT SO MUCH PURE ESCAPISM I GUESS AND LACK OF CYNICAL SOPHISTICATION IT HAS CLEARLY DEFINED GOOD GUYS WINNING AGAINST BAD GUYS IS THAT IT THE TRADITIONAL STRUCTURE OF SLOW BUILDUP TO A GRAND FINALE IT WAS THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN ALL THE SERIES I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AS STUDY MATERIAL LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE MORE USEFUL

ALSO USE OF WEAPONS CAN BE A FUN MATERIAL FOR LITERARY ANALYSIS QUITE APART FROM THE ENTIRE CULTURE UNIVERSE


NEVER HEARD OF THIS SERIES SOUNDS REALLY COOL GONNA HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT
THIS MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS SO YOU'VE BEEN ADVISED

IN FAIRNESS BANKS CULTURE SERIES CAN BE READ AS DYSTOPIAN FICTION IN ADDITION TO THE DARKER THEMES U KRASNYRED MENTIONS NOT TO MENTION THE OWN PRACTICES IN THE PLAYER OF GAMES THERE'S A STRONG ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT THE BIOLOGICAL RACES OF THE CULTURE I EAST THOSE THAT AREN'T MINDS OR AIS DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF AUTONOMY IN THE CIVILIZATION

THERE'S A REFERENCE IN LOOK TO WINDWARD WHERE ONE CHARACTER'S TALKING TO ZILLER ABOUT CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR AND HOW IT'S PUNISHED THROUGH SOCIAL OSTRACISM THE DISCUSSION TOUCHES UPON HOW EVEN THE DEVICES PEOPLE CARRY CAN PREVENT ANY BEHAVIOR THE COLLECTIVE CONSIDERS CRIMINAL CIRC THE CONVERSATION ORIGINALLY STARTED WITH A DISCUSSION ON OBSESSION STALKING GIVEN THAT MINDS ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN THESE THINGS BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE READ EXCRESSION AND YOU'LL DEFINITELY FEEL A FRISSON OF UNEASINESS IT'S REALLY HARD TO ARGUE THAT PEOPLE REGULAR PEOPLE CAN HAVE ANY MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE GOVERNANCE RULING OF THE CULTURE

THE COUNTERARGUMENT GIVEN TO THAT WAS THAT IF MINDS WOULDN'T KEEP PEOPLE SHORTHAND FOR THE LESSER RACES OF THE CULTURE HAPPY THEN THEY'D BE OSTRACIZED THEMSELVES THAT FACE OR REPUTATION WAS THE CURRENCY WITH WHICH MINDS DEALT I'M NOT CONVINCED BY THAT HOWEVER SEEING AS HOW THEY BEHAVED DURING EXCRESSION ALSO WITH THE GAP IN CAPABILITIES BETWEEN A MIND AND A REGULAR HUMAN SO VAST I DON'T THINK IT'D BE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR A MIND TO CONVINCE DECEIVE PEOPLE INTO THINKING THAT IT'S BENEVOLENT

TL R I LOVE IAIN MASCULINE BANKS CULTURE SERIES AND I HAVE A TINFOIL HAT THEORY THAT THE CULTURE ISN'T AS BENEVOLENT AS THEY PRETEND TO BE
THE IMPACT OF IAIN MASCULINE BANKS ON ENGLISH LITERATURE IS TRULY VERY SMALL COMPARED TO ORWELL HUXLEY OR EVEN HERBERT ASIMOV BRADBURY AND CLARKE HE'S NOT VERY GOOD AT CHARACTERIZATION AND HIS EARLY NOVELS COULD USE SOME EDITING THE OBVIOUS CHOICES FOR DOUBTFUL UTOPIAS ARE THINGS LIKE THOMAS UTOPIA OR INVISIBLE CITIES AMONG OTHERS WHICH SO FAR HAVE PROVEN FAR MORE IMPACTFUL ON LITERATURE
WHAT BOOKS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
WHO DECIDES WHAT BOOKS ARE REQUIRED READING THAT'S A LOT OF POWER TO PUT IN HANDS
WHY DID YOU SAY I THINK DYSTOPIAN FICTION SHOULD BE READ ALONGSIDE OTHER DYSTOPIAN FICTION


THE POINT OF HIGH SCHOOL READING IS TO READ BOOKS THAT FORM THE WESTERN LITERARY CANON I'VE LITERALLY NEVER HEARD OF THE AUTHOR YOU'VE MENTIONED AND IT'S DOUBTFUL THAT HIS NOVELS HAD ANYWHERE NEAR THE CULTURAL OR LITERARY SIGNIFICANCE THAT AND BRAVE NEW WORLD HAD YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR A SCIENCE FICTION SERIES THAT CAME OUR DECADES AFTER THESE TWO BOOKS WERE RELEASED AND WERE PROBABLY INFLUENCED BY THEM THERE'S NO REALLY A POINT IN TEACHING THEM WHEN THE ORIGINALS ARE ALREADY TAUGHT
HE SAW A CHAIR AND A SHIP THAT WAS NOT A SHIP HE SAW A MAN WITH TWO SHADOWS AND HE SAW THAT WHICH CANNOT BE SEEN A CONCEPT
I THINK THIS DISCUSSION IS PROOF ALONE THAT THE CULTURE BOOKS DESERVE TO BE ON SCHOOL READING LISTS
THE SUBTLETIES AND MINUTIAE OF THE STORIES AND THE DETAILS OF THE SOCIETY CAN HAVE YOU TALKING FOR DAYS IT'S SUCH A RICH UNIVERSE

ALSO AGREE THAT EXCRESSION IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES THO I NEED TO READ IT AGAIN
USE OF WEAPONS ALSO BRILLIANT THAT ONE REALLY PULLED THE RUG FROM UNDER ME AND NOT MANY BOOKS CAN DO THAT
JUST FINISHED READING THROUGH THE TALE I THINK I'M DONE WITH THE DYSTOPIA THEME FOR A WHILE NEVER HAVE I READ SOMETHING SO REVOLTING
ABSOLUTELY YES I LOVE THE CULTURE NOVELS SOME OF MY VERY FAVORITE FOR REASONS YOU MENTIONED I WOULD LIVE IN THAT WORLD
CULTURE SUCKS LOL READ GOOD SCI FI
DELETED
TRY A LOCAL LIBRARY MINE SELLS USED BOOKS FOR AND THE SELECTION CHANGES EVERY FEW DAYS

AS FOR A BOX OF BOOKS I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A SERVICE BUT IT'D BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE YOU WERE INTERESTED IN THEM IF THEY WERE PICKED OUT AT RANDOM
BEST BET FOR WHAT YOU WANT MIGHT BE A YARD GARAGE SALE I'VE PICKED UP BOXES OF RANDOM BOOKS FOR UNDER IT'S A CRAP SHOOT BUT USUALLY YOU'LL FIND SOME GOOD STUFF IN THERE AND THEN YOU CAN SWAP THE OTHERS
HALF PRICE BOOKS SELLS BOOKS BY THE YARD THROUGH THEIR WEBSITE AND YOU CAN CHOOSE TO GET MIXED BOOKS WHICH THE INFO PAGE SAYS ARE ABOUT FICTION AND NONFICTION IT LOOKS LIKE PRICES START AT PER BOX SO HERE YOU GO
IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO AMAZON THOUGH AMAZON ALSO SELLS BOOKS AS LOW AS A PENNY YOU PAY FOR SHIPPING YOU CAN GOOGLE INDEPENDENT BOOKSELLERS OR BOOK DEALERS WHO DON'T WORK THROUGH THESE SITES BUT UNFORTUNATELY MOST HAVE BEEN FORCED INTO IT OR FACE OBLIVION WHEN YOU SEE USED BOOKS FOR SALE ON AMAZON NOTE THE SELLER NAME THEY ARE NOT AMAZON PER SE BUT USING THE SITE TO PUT THEIR STOCK ON THE WEB AND PAYING AMAZON FOR THE LISTING EACH SELLER IS RATED AND AMAZON IS VERY HARSH ON IT'S SELLERS AND ACTUALLY SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND ONE YOU LIKE AND TRUST YOU CAN ONLY CONTACT AN AMAZON AND I GUESS AN ABE BOOK DEALER THROUGH THOSE SITES THOUGH THOSE ARE THE RULES AND I GUESS THEY PROTECT BOTH PARTIES AS WELL AS THE UMBRELLA CORPORATIONS
YOU CAN ALSO TRY BETTER WORLD BOOKS
I SEE YOU WANT THE BOOKS TO BE AT RANDOM AND NOT CHOSEN BUT HAVE YOU TRIED GOING TO A THRIFT STORE
CIRC DOES SORT OF A GRAB BAG TYPE THING OR AT LEAST THEY USED TO EITHER WAY I'D CHECK THAT OUT

I LITERALLY JUUUUUST STARTED THAT SHORT STORY AFTER SEEING ARRIVAL LAST WEEKEND SO FAR IT MAKES ME THINK OF FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON HAVEN'T READ ENOUGH YET TO KNOW IF IT WOULD BE A GOOD MOVIE

YES YOU CAN DONATE THEM CHECK WITH YOUR LIBRARY BEFORE DONATING SINCE YOU CAN'T RESELL NOT EVEN FOR A LIBRARY BOOK SALE SOME MIGHT PUT THEM ON A FREE CART ALSO DEPENDING ON HOW NEW THEY ARE THE COLLECTIONS DEVELOPMENT LIBRARIANS MAY APPRECIATE THEM TO SEE ABOUT ORDERING NEW BOOKS I HAVE A TON OF ARCS MYSELF AND I PUT THEM IN LITTLE FREE LIBRARIES
YOU CAN GIVE THEM TO PEOPLE BUT YOU CAN'T SELL THEM I MEAN YOU CAN WHO'S GOING TO STOP YOU BUT YOU SHOULDN'T

AND SINCE THEY ARE CLEARLY LABELED ARC OR GALLEY AND SAY THAT THERE MAY BE CHANGES BETWEEN IT AND THE FINISHED PRODUCT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE CHEATING ANYONE
I RUN A BOOK BLOG AND USE THEM FOR GIVEAWAYS SOME SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN LOWER BUDGET AREAS SOMETIMES WILL TAKE THEM AS THEY OFTEN HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING BOOKS LITTLE FREE LIBRARIES ARE GOOD OPTIONS TOO

NOT FUNNY LADS
UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME

NO IT DOES NOT GET BETTER THE OPENING SEQUENCE WITH ALL THE CHARACTERS WAS IN MY OPINION THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK I HAD TO PUT IT DOWN AFTER PAGES BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE A NEVER ENDING INTRODUCTION TO THE STORY THAT WAS EVENTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN FOR EXAMPLE A HUGE PORTION OF THE BOOK IS DIALOGUE BETWEEN CHARACTERS THAT'S SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF

CHARACTER DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE PROMISED EACH OTHER

CHARACTER 2 OF COURSE I REMEMBER DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED ALL THOSE YEARS AGO

CHARACTER YES I REMEMBER SOMETHING FROM ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WHAT WAS IT

CHARACTER 2 THAT THING THAT HAPPENED IT WAS THAT THING THAT HAPPENED

ALL THE WHILE YOU DON'T GET TO LEARN ABOUT THE ACTUAL THING THAT HAPPENED UNTIL THE VERY END OF THE BOOK I FOUND IT ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING TO READ

I THINK STEPHEN KING HAS A REAL PACING ISSUE HIS SHORT WORKS LIKE CARRIE OR MISERY ARE GREAT BUT ONCE HE SETS OUT TO WRITE A PAGE NOVEL LOT UNDER THE DOME AND IT I THINK HE HAS A HUGE ISSUE WITH MOVING THE PLOT ALONG IN A WAY THAT'S MEANINGFUL FOR THE READER THAT BEING SAID EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHER SEEMS TO ADORE IT SO MAYBE I'M THE WEIRD ONE

I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A SOLID PAGES IF YOU'RE NOT INTO IT PUT IT DOWN AND DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT IT
IF YOU'RE ENJOYING IT SO FAR STICK WITH IT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WITH THEIR PROMISE IS NOT ACTUALLY ANSWERED UNTIL THE END THAT IS TRUE BUT THERE IS ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU GOING THROUGHOUT I THINK ENCOUNTERS WITH IT HISTORY OF IT IN DERRY ETC THE PROMISE IS ESSENTIALLY THAT THEY WOULD ALL COME BACK TO DERRY IF IT CAME BACK NOT REALLY A SPOILER THIS CAN BE INFERRED PRETTY EARLY ON THE MYSTERY OF IT IS AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE KIDS IS PART OF THE FUN OF THE BOOK
I LOVED IT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND COUNTED IT AMONG MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOKS I JUST STARTED TRYING TO REREAD IT AGAIN AFTER HEARING ABOUT THE NEW MOVIE AND MY ADULT TASTES SEEM TO BE GETTING BORED WITH IT

IT IS VERY DRAWN OUT AND IT DOES REQUIRE YOU TO REALLY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT THE CHARACTERS OVER WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING THE FOCUS OF THE BOOK IS MORE ON EVERY LITTLE PIECE OF THE CHARACTER'S STORY AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL EVENTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE

IF THIS BORES YOU THEN YOU SHOULD PROBABLY JUST WATCH THE MOVIE WITH TIM CURRY IT FOLLOWS THE BOOK PRETTY CLOSELY BUT CUTS OUT THE DRAGGED OUT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE AND WANT A DIRECTOR'S CUT THEN GO BACK TO THE BOOK WHICH HAS FAR MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AND TOWN
THE BOOK DOES GET BETTER YES I AM NEARLY FINISHED AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PUT IT DOWN I CAN'T TELL YOU MUCH BUT IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTIONS

MANY OBSCENE AND UNEXPECTED THINGS WILL HAPPEN

2 IT ITSELF IS MORE THAN JUST A CLOWN
IT BY STEPHEN KING IS PERHAPS MY FAVOURITE NOVEL THE ONLY THING THAT EDGES CLOSE TO IT IS ANOTHER KING WORK PET CEMETARY WHICH I THOUGHT WAS JUST AS CREEPY AND SCARY HONESTLY THOUGH A BIG BOOK LIKE THAT CAN BE A HUGE COMMITMENT SO I THINK YOU SHOULD ONLY CONTINUE IT IF YOU HONESTLY ENJOY WRITING

I LOVE THE WAY THE WORLD OF DERRY WAS BUILT UP I COULD REALLY SEE THE TOWN AND THE WRONGNESS IN IT BUT IF YOU DISLIKE THE WAY KING WRITES THEN A HUGE BOOK LIKE IT MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST PLACE TO START OFF WITH
THIS BOOK SERIOUSLY DRAGS I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT YES I FINISHED IT
I ENJOYED EVERY WORD AND WAS HOOKED THE WHOLE WAY OTHERS IN THIS THREAD DISAGREE HOW CAN YOU LISTEN TO EITHER OF US AND DECIDE TO GO ON OR NOT YOU KNOW OPINIONS ARE SUBJECTIVE AND VARY WILDLY SO THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW IF LETTING RANDOM PEOPLE CHOOSE WHETHER TO CONTINUE OR NOT WILL BE THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR YOU

HONESTLY MAKING THIS POST TELLS ME YOU'RE PROBABLY ALREADY CLOSE TO DECIDING NOT TO GO ON SO I'D GUESS YOU'LL GO THAT ROUTE

I KNOW THE DARK APP ARTS AMU
THEY DERAIL THE PLOT BY TWISTING IT OUT OF SHAPE AS A BLACK HOLE TWISTS SPACE-TIME

THE IS NOT DEFINED BY ABILITY IT'S BASED ON THAT ABILITY BEING BULLSHIT THEY WIN NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD BUT BECAUSE THE AUTHOR HANDED THEM VICTORY IN WAYS THAT BREAK THE LOGIC OF THE STORY THE VILLAIN MAKES MISTAKES SO BAD THAT YOU WONDER HOW THEY MANAGE TO BREATHE WITHOUT MANUALLY REMINDING THEMSELVES TO INHALE THE HERO WINS BECAUSE OF TRAITS THEY DO NOT DEMONSTRATE ANYWHERE ELSE AUTHOR FIAT GIVES THEM A CROWN RATHER THAN WORK
FOR ME IT'S IN THE EXECUTION OFTEN THE MARY SUE ISN'T ACTUALLY SO SMART ETC WE'RE JUST TOLD THEY ARE OVER AND OVER THE OTHER MAJOR TURNOFF FOR ME IS THAT OFTEN MORALITY IN THE WORK CENTERS AROUND THE SUE BAD THINGS ARE BAD UNLESS THE SUE DOES THEM OR IS BENEFITED BY THEM TO TAKE A WELL KNOWN EXAMPLE FROM A FRANCHISE I ACTUALLY QUITE LIKE IN THE FIRST HUNGER GAMES NOVEL CHARACTERS WHO HAVE NICE THINGS THEY COULD EASILY SELL FOR FOOD ARE PORTRAYED NEGATIVELY BUT IT'S OKAY FOR KATNISS TO KEEP AN EXPENSIVE GOLD BROOCH THAT COULD FEED HER OWN FAMILY CHARACTERS WHO WANT TO SURVIVE AT ANY COST AND WHO FORGE ALLIANCES ARE EVIL BUT KATNISS IS CUNNING FOR COMING INTO THE COMPETITION WITH STRATEGIES AND HER OWN TRAINING

THIS MINDSET USUALLY ARISES WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIMITED TIME FOR READING SO THEY GET FRANTIC WITH IT IF YOU NEED HELP FOCUSING I'VE READ BOOKS WITH THE AUDIOBOOK PLAYING BEHIND ME ON DAYS WHERE I WAS HAVING TROUBLE PAYING ATTENTION AUDIOBOOKS ARE EXPENSIVE SO I'M ASSUMING YOU EITHER ARE RICH OR A PIRATE WITH THIS SUGGESTION I'M ONE OF THOSE TWO THINGS AND LOVE AUDIOBOOKS
SUGGESTION STOP MAKING LENGTHY LISTS PICK YOUR BOOKS MORE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT BECAUSE I THINK I'LL ENJOY READING THIS IF THE LIST ISN'T THERE YOU WON'T BE BUSTING IT SO HARD TO GET THROUGH IT
I STRUGGLED WITH THIS GETTING RID OF THE LIST IS A GOOD START AS ANOTHER POSTER SUGGESTED ALTHOUGH I HAVE A COMPROMISE THAT WORKS FOR ME THE CONSIDERING LIST IF I SEE A BOOK THAT INTERESTS ME THEN I TOSS IT ON THE LIST IF AT ANY POINT I DECIDE NAH NOT INTERESTED THEN I STRIKE IT FURTHERMORE IF ENOUGH TIME PASSES AND I STILL HAVEN'T READ IT FOR ME IT'S ABOUT A YEAR THEN I STRIKE IT

ANOTHER TIP IS TO GIVE YOURSELF PERMISSION TO STOP READING AT ANY TIME AT ANY TIME IF THE READING IS AN ASSIGNMENT FOR CLASS OR WORK THEN TREAT IT AS SUCH BUT IF IT'S FOR YOU AND YOUR OWN SELF-IMPROVEMENT THEN HELP YOURSELF BE THE BEST READER YOU CAN YOU NEED TO BE THE SOLE DECIDER OF WHAT'S WORTH YOUR TIME

LET'S SAY YOU'RE READING A CLASSIC SOMETHING YOU FEEL IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU'RE NOT INTO IT SET IT ASIDE NO HARD FEELINGS AND MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE YOU'LL COME BACK TO IT BUT NOW IS CLEARLY NOT THE RIGHT TIME READING SHOULD BE ENGAGING NOT LIKE WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND FORCED TO EAT LIMA BEANS BECAUSE THEY WERE GOOD FOR US

THESE ARE ALL TIPS THAT WORKED FOR ME FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU AND HAPPY READING
AN AIDE TO REMEMBERING WHAT HAPPENS IN A STORY IS ONCE THE SCENE IS OVER TO STOP READING FOR A MINUTE AND TAKE THE TIME TO PUT INTO YOUR OWN WORDS WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED SKIMMING THROUGH THE PAGES AGAIN IF NECESSARY THIS HELPS YOU TO PARSE THE INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT IS FAMILIAR TO AND MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY YOU THIS MAKES IT EASIER TO REMEMBER THERE ARE ALSO INSIGHTFUL CHAPTER SUMMARIES AVAILABLE ON SPARK NOTES FOR A LOT OF POPULAR BOOKS THEY'LL ALWAYS INCLUDE AN OBSERVATION OR AN ANGLE YOU HADN'T THOUGHT OF BEFORE

ANOTHER WAY IS TO PUT MORE EFFORT INTO IMAGINING WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE STORY THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF MEMORIZATION OF INFORMATION GENERALLY LIKE ASSOCIATING NUMBERS WITH OBJECTS AS YOU WALK THROUGH AN IMAGINARY HOUSE SO MERGING A STORY WITH THIS METHOD IS IDEAL FOR THE PROCESS OF READING BECAUSE THE TWO GO HAND IN HAND IMAGINATION ALSO MAKES FOR A RICHER AND MORE IMMERSIVE READING EXPERIENCE WHICH IS IMPORTANT

ALSO IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU HAVEN'T FOUND A BOOK YOU'VE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED YET I READ THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO WHICH IS ABOUT PAGES AND IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE BREEZE BECAUSE IT JUST WAS SO INCREDIBLY GOOD BEFORE THIS I HAD NEVER READ A TRULY LONG BOOK LONGEST WAS EAST OF EDEN AT PAGES AND THAT WAS A STRUGGLE BECAUSE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF GETTING THROUGH A BOOK WAS HALF THE ENJOYMENT FOR ME OR SO I THOUGHT UNTIL I READ A BOOK THAT REALLY BLEW MY MIND READING TO FINISH A BOOK IS TO COMPLETELY MISS THE POINT ALTOGETHER READING FOR THE SAKE OF IT SHOULD BE THE GOAL

I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY JUDGEMENTS ABOUT YOU BUT ANOTHER THING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE THE CONCEPTUAL TOOLS TO READ A BOOK CRITICALLY IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THE LESS YOU KNOW HOW TO EXTRACT DEPTH AND MEANING OUT OF A STORY THEN LESS ENJOYMENT YOU'LL GET OUT OF A BOOK THUS RESORTING TO READING FOR THE SAKE OF FINISHING A BOOK RATHER THAN ENJOYING THE EXPERIENCE STORIES WILL SEEM SOMEWHAT MORE FLAT BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY EVER READING AT THE SURFACE LEVEL PERHAPS YOU MIGHT BENEFIT FROM READING NORTHROP ANATOMY OF CRITICISM OR HOW TO READ A BOOK BY ADLER DOREN
IF YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT IT TRY TAKING NOTES AS YOU GO I DO IT FOR AT LEAST EVEN IF IT'S NOT FOR A CLASS OR ASSIGNMENT OF SOME KIND TAKING NOTES DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A CHORE THERE'S NO NEED TO TASK YOUR BRAIN WITH REMEMBERING A BUNCH OF STUFF

MAYBE THIS PART IS BAD ADVICE BUT SOMETIMES SMOKING A CIGARETTE HELPS PUT ME IN THE RIGHT MINDSET GIVES ME JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF EXTRA STIMULATION TO KEEP MY MIND FROM RACING I THINK MEDITATION PRIOR TO READING WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT IF YOU'RE NOT A CANCER FAN
I ALSO STRUGGLE REMEMBERING INFORMATION BUT I DON'T MIND IT NOW IF YOU DO WANT TO THOROUGHLY GO THROUGH A BOOK I'D RECOMMEND READING IT IN FRAGMENTS BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP

THAT MIGHT DEVELOP IN ANOTHER PROBLEM BEING THE FACT THAT READING WILL MAKE YOU SLEEPY ON THE OTHER HAND YOUR BRAIN WILL PROCESS THE INFORMATION FROM THE BOOK WHILE YOU SLEEP IT WOULD ALSO HELP IF YOU WOULD DISCUSS THE BOOK WITH SOMEONE OR IF YOU DUG THROUGH AND MADE MENTAL CONNECTIONS CONCERNING THE RELEVANT INFORMATION PARALLELS TRAIN OF THOUGHT LEADING FROM ONE IDEA TO ANOTHER BASICALLY YOU WOULD NEED TO CONCEPTUALIZE WHAT YOU READ INFORMATION IN CONNECTION TO ANOTHER LEADS TO THE STRENGTHENING OF BOTH

THAT'S HOW I SEE IT ANYWAY HOPE IT HELPS
I GOT INTO DYSTOPIAN BOOKS AND WHEN I FINISH THEM I LIKE TO COMPARE THE SOCIETIES THINK ABOUT THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES TO CULTURE ETC I MAKE A SORT OF VENN DIAGRAM IN MY JOURNAL AND I FIND IT HELPS ME REMEMBER MORE SUBTLE THINGS FROM THE BOOKS
I'M NOT A COMPLETEST BUT I DO LIKE TO FINISH BOOKS I CHOOSE THEM CAREFULLY IN THE FIRST PLACE NOT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE MY KIND OF BOOK BUT TO SEE WHETHER THEY ARE WELL REGARDED IF THEY ARE AND I END UP NOT LIKING THEM I FINISH THEM IN ORDER TO TRY AND SECOND-GUESS WHY REVIEWERS LIKE THEM SO MUCH THIS HAPPENS A LOT WITH ME ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M READING KATE ATKINSON AND IAN MCEWAN VERY VERY OCCASIONALLY LESS THAN ONCE A YEAR I GIVE UP ON A BOOK
I ALMOST COMPULSIVELY FIND THAT I HAVE TO CHECK BOOKS OF MY LIST BUT IF I'M NOT ENJOYING THE BOOK OR I FIND MY SELF RUSHING THROUGH IT I'LL SET IT ASIDE AND READ A DIFFERENT BOOK EVENTUALLY I WORK MY WAY BACK TO THE BOOK I SET ASIDE AND DEVOTE MORE TIME TO IT AFTER THE SECOND CHANCE IF IT STILL DOESN'T GROW ON ME I SET IT DOWN AND DON'T LOOK BACK IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING I HAD TO LEARN BUT I'M SO HAPPY THAT I MANAGED IT
I HAD THE SAME MINDSET WHEN MUCH YOUNGER I'VE LEARNED TO LET GO OF IT AND ACCEPT THAT A CERTAIN BOOK MAY FAIL TO ENTERTAIN OR INTEREST ME HALFWAY INTO IT AND SO IT'S FINE TO PUT IT DOWN ANOTHER STRATEGY IS TO READ SEVERAL BOOKS SIMULTANEOUSLY SO THAT WHEN YOU LOSE INTEREST IN ONE YOU CAN PICK UP ANOTHER AND RETURN TO THE FIRST BOOK LATER THIS CAN GET OUT OF HAND OF COURSE
DON'T LET THE GUILT GET TO YOU IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T FINISH A BOOK RIGHT AWAY I KNOW HOW IT FEELS WHEN THAT UNFINISHED SECTION OF YOUR BOOKSHELF IS EXPANDING YOU JUST FEEL LIKE CRAP FOR BUYING ALL THOSE BOOKS AND THEN THERE'S YOUR NON READING FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO'LL PATRONIZE YOU FOR MAKING POOR BUYING CHOICES IT SUCKS BUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH IS SOMETHING EVERY READER HAS FACED AT SOME POINT IN HIS HER LIFE HOARDING BOOKS DIGITALLY OR PHYSICALLY IS ALSO VERY COMMON IT'S A CONCERN WHEN YOU'RE JUST BUYING AND NOT READING ANYTHING YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUSH TO FINISH IT WHEN I WAS DOING THAT I'VE FINISHED ENTIRE NOVELS WITHOUT GETTING ANYTHING OUT OF THEM SO WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS THAT IT'S OKAY TO FINISH A BOOK EVEN IF IT TAKES YOU YEARS IF YOU DON'T ENJOY THE BOOK AND NOT LEARNING ANYTHING NEW EITHER JUST PUT IT DOWN AND PICK IT UP A FEW WEEKS LATER WE EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT THINGS IN OUR LIVES EVERYDAY SOMETIMES THE BOOK RESONATES WITH OUR CURRENT FEELINGS AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T I AM A SLOW READER IT'S NOT MY BEST QUALITY AND I AM NOT PROUD OF IT OR ANYTHING BUT STILL WHEN I TALKED WITH MY OTHER FRIENDS WHO ARE CRAZY FAST READERS I REALIZED THAT THEY USUALLY MISS SOME KEY NOTIONS FROM BOOKS AND THEY'RE OKAY WITH IT AS THEY DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON A BOOK I FOR ONE WANT TO GET THE MOST OUT OF A BOOK AND I AM OKAY WITH SPENDING MORE TIME ON IT IF IT HELPS ME UNDERSTAND THE BOOK BETTER BINGE READING BINGE WATCHING OR BINGE ANYTHING IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU AS YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT AFTER FEW DAYS IT'S BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GIVE YOUR BRAIN ENOUGH TIME TO PROCESS THOSE THOUGHTS AND INFORMATION AND WHAT GOOD A BOOK IS IF YOU DIDN'T ENJOY IT AND HAVEN'T LEARNED ANYTHING FROM IT EITHER IT TOOK ME YEARS TO COMPLETE THE FOUNTAINHEAD THE BOOK HAD SOME STRONG OPINIONS AND WITH SO MANY THINGS GOING ON IN MY LIFE IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO KEEP UP WITH IT I PICKED IT UP LATER WHEN I WAS FEELING OKAY AND I FINISHED IT WITHOUT GETTING DEPRESSED IT GETS QUITE DEPRESSING SOMETIMES SO MY POINT IS YOU DON'T FEEL SAME ALL THE TIME AND IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT YOU WONT RETAIN SAME EMOTIONS WHEN YOU STARTED READING THOSE BEST BOOKS YOU MUST READ BEFORE YOU DIE FOR LONG SO PUT THOSE BOOKS DOWN IN A PLACE WHERE THEY WON'T BUG YOU AND PICK THEM LATER
I'VE PERSONALLY FOUND IT VERY HELPFUL TO WRITE MY OWN REVIEW OF BOOKS WHEN I FINISH THEM IT FORCES ME TO REFLECT ON EXACTLY WHAT I LIKED HATED PUTTING WORDS TO MY GENERAL IMPRESSION OF A BOOK ALSO ALLOWS ME TO LOOK BACK LATER AND RECALL WHAT HAPPENED MUCH MORE EASILY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS
I QUIT GOODREADS BECAUSE OF THIS IT HELPED A LOT ALSO LEFT MORE TIME FOR ACTUAL READING
THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN READ IN ONE SITTING BEFORE YOURE JUST SKIMMING PAGES AND NOT TAKING INFORMATION IN FOR ME PERSONALLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN PAGES OF ANY BOOK IS ALL I CAN TAKE IN ONE SITTING GIVE YOURSELF DAILY GOALS AND A DEADLINE FOR FINISHING THE BOOK BASED ON THOSE GOALS FOR EXAMPLE A PAGE BOOK WOULD BE PAGES A DAY FOR DAYS OR TWO WEEKS TOPS TRY TO CATCH YOURSELF IF YOU'RE RUSHING AND DON'T BE AFRAID TO RE READ TAKE SOME TIME AFTER YOU'RE DONE TO REFLECT ON WHAT YOU READ THAT DAY AND TRY TO GO OVER THE MAJOR POINTS IN YOUR HEAD HOPE IT HELPS
I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY A PROBLEM I USED TO MAKE A POINT OF ONLY READING GREAT BOOKS THAT WERE TRULY WORTH MY WHILE I ENDED UP NOT READING VERY MUCH AT ALL WHEN I GOT INTO THE HABIT OF PICKING UP THE BOOK CHALLENGE AND OTHER CRAZY READING GOAL LISTS I DIDN'T ABSORB EVERY BOOK FULLY BUT RANDOMLY A BOOK WILL BE GREAT ENOUGH THAT I'LL SLOW DOWN FOR IT OR IT'LL STICK WITH ME IT'S LIKE SCAVENGING FOR HIDDEN TREASURE THE GOOD STUFF IS GOING TO STICK A BIT BETTER THE POINT OF GOING THROUGH THOSE QUANTITY LISTS IS TO READ A LOT OF VARIETY AND FIND OUT WHAT TYPES OF BOOKS YOU LIKE BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'LL NEVER TRULY KNOW THE STUFF THAT TRULY CLICKS WITH YOU IS GOING TO ABSORB BETTER NO MATTER WHAT
I'M ALSO A BIT OF A COMPLEXIONIST BUT I ALSO DON'T LIKE RUSHING THROUGH BOOKS SO I TEND TO JUST MAKE MYSELF TRUDGE THROUGH SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT REALLY FEELING SO I CAN SEE HOW IT ENDS

RECENTLY THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH HUNTER SOUTH THE CURSE OF LONZO I'VE LOVED EVERYTHING ELSE OF HIS THAT I'VE READ BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T REALLY GRAB ME I'M ABOUT THROUGH IT AND COULD PROBABLY FINISH IT IN ABOUT AN HOUR IF I SAT DOWN AND FOCUSED BUT IT DOESN'T HOLD MY ATTENTION VERY WELL SO I THINK I'M JUST GONNA DROP IT IT'LL BE THE FIRST TIME I'VE MADE IT PAST THE FIRST OR SO PAGES OF A BOOK AND THEN DIDN'T FINISH IT BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY TO DO IT GETTING HUNG UP ON THIS BOOK HAS CUT MY READING TIME DOWN DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST WEEK SO I'LL JUST MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
I HAVE A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM I'VE READ SO MANY BOOKS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES I'LL READ PAGES OF A NEW ONE BEFORE I REALIZE SHIT I'VE READ THIS ALREADY AND I ALSO SEEM TO PRIORITIZE CRITICALLY ACKNOWLEDGED CLASSICS I THINK IT'S OKAY IF GETTING THROUGH A BOOK IS SOME EFFORT NOBODY THAT I KNOW AT LEAST READS MYTH OF SISYPHUS FOR THE SAME REASON THEY READ THE LATEST DAN BROWN NOVEL

BASICALLY REGARDLESS OF YOUR MOTIVATION TO READ WHETHER IT'S PURELY FOR PLEASURE OR YOU'RE CONSIDERING A RUN ON JEOPARDY AS LONG AS YOU ARE ENJOYING IT AND FULFILLING YOUR REASON FOR READING I THINK YOU'RE OKAY AND THERE ARE SOME GOOD TIPS IN THE REST OF THIS THREAD FOR BETTER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU READ HOPE THIS HELPS
I THINK I'M THE OPPOSITE I OFTEN FIND MYSELF NEGLECTING THE ENDING OF A BOOK I THOROUGHLY ENJOY TO LET MY IMAGINATION CREATE MULTIPLE ENDINGS SOME I NEVER FINISH IT MIGHT BE A FUN EXERCISE TO GO INTO A BOOK KNOWING THAT YOU WON'T READ THE FINAL CHAPTER FOR X AMOUNT OF TIME
I DON'T KNOW IF WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER WOULD BE OF MUCH HELP MAINLY BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE SLOWER SIDE OF READING STARTING OUT I'D SET A PAGE GOAL FOR MYSELF AFTER FINISHING I'D REFLECT ON WHAT HAPPENED AND OTHER DETAILS ALSO IT'S SOMEWHAT TRIVIAL BUT I'VE ALWAYS LIKED TO REFLECT ON CERTAIN EMOTIONS AND OTHER VIVID IMAGERY THAT SOME GIFTED AUTHORS USE RAY BRADBURY IS THE KING OF THIS
IF YOU'RE SIMPLY JUST FORGETTING DETAILS OR OTHER SECONDARY CHARACTERS OR ANY TRAITS THEY MAY HAVE I'D ALWAYS MAKE LISTS OR SIMILAR NOTES ON A PIECE OF PAPER OR MY BOOKMARK ALWAYS A QUICK REFERENCE COMPARED TO FLIPPING TO APPENDICES COMMONLY FOUND IN HUGE CLUNKERS I STARTED DOING THIS WITH BOOKS LIKE LES MISERABLÉS
I'VE FOUND THAT TAKING A MOMENT AFTER EACH PAGE TO REMEMBER THAT PAGE'S SETTING TO BE USEFUL
I JUST PLAY AROUND WITH THE IDEAS AS I READ AND CONTINUE ADAPTING AS MORE CONCEPTS ARE INTRODUCED ACADEMIC WISE

LITERARY WISE JUST READ FOR FUN ON YOUR OWN PACE AND LET YOUR MIND DO WHATEVER IT WANTS TO DO VISUALISER MAKE RANDOM CONNECTIONS ETC ETC

I RECOMMEND YOU TRY TO FIND A COMFORTABLE AREA THAT YOU CAN RELAX IN AND READ SOMETHING ON A PACE WHERE YOU CAN RECALL WHAT YOU READ PRETTY ACCURATELY TRY TO EXPERIMENT IF YOU'D LIKE AND STOP READING SAY AFTER EVERY CHAPTER AND TRY TO RECALL WHAT YOU JUST READ AND GO BACK TO SEE IF YOU REMEMBERED THEM HAHA
NOBODY REQUIRES YOU TO FINISH YOUR BOOKS IN THE ORDER YOU STARTED

IT'S OKAY TO PUT ONE BOOK OFF AND READ ANOTHER ONE THAT BETTER SUITS YOUR CURRENT STATE OF MIND THEN COME BACK LATER WITH A FRESH PALATE AND NEW EXPERIENCES
I USED TO BE A COMPLETEST BUT NOT ANYMORE I GENERALLY GIVE A BOOK A HUNDRED PAGES IF I'M NOT INTERESTED BY THEN I PUT IT DOWN IF IT'S A BOOK BY AN AUTHOR I'VE READ BEFORE AND I LIKE OR IF IT'S GOTTEN TREMENDOUS REVIEWS I'LL PUT IT ASIDE AND TRY AGAIN LATER BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY GOOD BOOKS IN THE WORLD TO WASTE TIME ON ONE YOU SIMPLY AREN'T ENJOYING READING IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN
JUST BE AWARE OF WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT SLOW DOWN AND CONCENTRATE THERE'S NO REAL TRICK TO IT OTHER THAN BEING CONSCIOUS OF YOUR BEHAVIOUR AND MODIFYING IT
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH BY CHECKING BOOKS OFF A LIST AND WHY IS THAT BETTER THAN TAKING YOUR TIME
I READ THE WORD BOOKS AS JOKES AND WAS READING THROUGH WAITING FOR THE JOKE
WANTING TO FINISH ONE BOOK IS COMPLEXIONIST WHAT IS IT CALLED WHEN YOU HAVE THIS URGE TO FINISH ENTIRE SERIES JUST BECAUSE YOU STARTED READING BOOK

IS IT ME OR DO THE CHEEKS AND JAW OF ALL OF THEM LOOK ODD
THE MONSTER DON'T LOOK HALF BAD
TIL SHERLOCK HOLMES LOOKS LIKE COREY FELDMAN
NICE TO SEE COMAMIE ON A LIST LIKE THIS
THEY USED PRETTY SOFTWARE THIS WAS ALL DONE BY A COMPUTER I KNOW BECAUSE WE HAD THIS AT MY HIGH SCHOOL AND I WOULD MAKE HITLER ALL THE TIME THERE WAS AN SS HAT PROGRAM WAS CALL FACES AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE THING TO DO WAS HAVE A GANSA WITH TWO HEADBANDS ON
I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST READ DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE AND WAS SURPRISED BY THE IDEA THAT HYDE IS A SLENDER LITTLE GUY IT'S PRETTY AMUSING THAT POP CULTURE HAS PRETTY MUCH MADE HIM LITERALLY THE HULK
TORRANCE ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE NICHOLSON
THESE ARE TERRIBLE MOST OF THEM LOOK LIKE TEEN BOYS AND THE MONSTER LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE DESCRIPTION
MONSTER LOOKS LIKE TOM NOONAN WHO INCIDENTALLY DID PLAY HIM IN MONSTER SQUAD
SHERLOCK LOOKS LIKE A POORLY DRAWN FAN ART OF BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH SO YEAH HE IS THE RIGHT MAN TO PLAY SHERLOCK
HIS HAIR HANGING IN HIS EYES
HAIR IS PARTED TO THE SIDE EYES AND FOREHEAD COMPLETELY CLEAR WHO ARE THEY FUCKING KIDDING
THEY ALL LOOK LIKE GREYS TRYING TO MIMIC HUMAN APPEARANCE
THIS CONFUSED ME FOR A QUICK SECOND
WAS HOPING TO SEE HOLDEN CAUFIELD
I THINK IT'S NEAT HOW GRACILE MOST OF THE FEATURES WERE


MY FIRST RESPONSE WAS THAT THE IS NOT FICTIONAL AND HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE

I FIND THIS EFFORT FASCINATING BECAUSE I TEND TO GLOSS OVER DESCRIPTIONS OF CHARACTERS I MEAN I READ THEM BUT I APPARENTLY DON'T INTERNALIZE THEM BECAUSE LATER SOME CHARACTERISTIC WILL SURPRISE ME AND TOTALLY BE AT ODDS WITH THE CHARACTER I'M PICTURING IN MY HEAD
THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING I DO FIND IT ODD THOUGH MOST OF THE CHARACTERS HAVE ALMOST INHUMANLY THIN NECKS A NARROW JAW AND CHIN AND LARGE EYES
THEY ALL LOOK VERY EFFEMINATE NO I THINK IT'S THE LIPS
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA

I HOPE THIS IS DONE FOR MORE BOOKS AS WELL
IS IT JUST ME OR DO YOU NOT SEE THE THUMBNAIL PICTURE IN THAT LIST
YOU MEAN DR JACKIE AND MRS HYDE
THESE BARELY LOOK LIKE PEOPLE
WHY DO THEY ALL HAVE WEIRD ANIME EYES
THERE'S NOTHING SQUARE ABOUT JAWLINE THE IMAGE DOESN'T MATCH THE DESCRIPTION AT ALL
FACE IS A PLEASING OVAL SHAPE

CHIN IS INEXPLICABLY TWICE AS LONG AND POINTIER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE
AFD SHERLOCK HOLMES STILL LOOKS LIKE EGGS BENEDICT CUCUMBERS JUST WITHOUT THE HAIR
THE SHINNING AORTA LOOKS LIKE THE GUY FROM LOGANS RUN
MY FAVOURITE WAS ALWAYS JACK REACHER



NOW IMAGINE TOM CRUISE TRYING TO PLAY THAT CHARACTER
NO WONDER BUTTERCUP CABBAGEPATCH WAS SUCH A GOOD CHOICE FOR SHERLOCK
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO CALL THEM POLICE SKETCHES IT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THEY GRABBED A VETERAN ON THE FORCE AND DECIDED YOU'RE GONNA TAKE SOME SKETCHING CLASSES IN CASE WE NEED SOME WORK DONE THEY CAN'T JUST BE SKETCHES THEY HAVE TO BE POLICE SKETCHES

COULDN'T THEY JUST SAY PROFESSIONAL SKETCHES
THEY ALL LOOK LIKE FUCKING ALIENS THESE SKETCHES ARE PATHETIC
WERE THEY ALL ON THE BEST OF TALKING HEADS ALBUM COVER
NICHOLSON WAS PRETTY CLOSE IN FAIRNESS
IF ALIENS TRIED TO LOOK LIKE HUMANS BASED ON BOOK DESCRIPTIONS
THAT THOUGH
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WHEN THE SHINING GETS REMADE IN PATRICK WILSON SHOULD PLAY JACK RIGHT
SHERLOCK HOLMES STILL KIND OF LOOKS LIKE BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH JUST SAYING
POLICE SKETCHES ARE ALWAYS SHIT
WHY DO THEY ALL LOOK LIKE THE GREY ALIEN FROM WHITLEY COMMUNION
SHERLOCK HOLMES LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE DAVID TENNANT
SO MADS MIKKELSEN IS DR JEKYLL
SHERLOCK HOLMES ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
YEAH IT'S NOT LIKE I NEED SLEEP OR ANYTHING
SITE KEEPS JUMPING TO A BULLSHIT FULL PAGE FACEBOOK LOOKING AD ON MOBILE

WANT ME TO NEVER GO BACK TO YOUR SITE THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT
INTERESTING BUT THESE AREN'T EVEN SKETCHES
TIL EVERYONE IN BOOKS HAVE POINTY NOSES
SOMEONE WAS PAYING ATTENTION WHEN THEY CAST JEREMY BRETT AS SHERLOCK HOLMES THEN GUY RITCHIE NOT SO MUCH
THESE ARE ALL SO WRONG IT SAYS MR HYDE IS DWARFISH AND TROGLODYTIC THAT PIC LOOKS NOTHING LIKE A MONGOLOID THE MONSTER HAS BLACK FLOWING HAIR AND IS DESCRIBED AS BEAUTIFUL NOPE SHERLOCK HAS A HAWKISH NOSE AND A THIN SQUARE JAW NOPE THE FIRST ONE HAS CHEEK BONES NUMBER ALL SO BAD BORDERLINE CLICK BAIT
INTERESTING ACTUALLY I ALWAYS THOUGHT JACK DORRANCE WAS ATTRACTIVE THAT'S HOW HE WAS ABLE TO GET GOOD JOBS THERE WOULD BE SIGNS OF ALCOHOLISM LIKE REDNESS ABOUT THE FACE AND SWOLLEN EYES I IMAGINED HIS HAIR LONGISH BUT THICK AND MESSY

BUT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO FOOL THEM UPON FIRST IMPRESSIONS AND THEN IT WOULD BUILD UP TIL HE EXPLODED
NURSE RACHET JILLIAN ANDERSON
SO MR HYDE WAS JUST DR JEKYLL AT THE END OF NOVEMBER
SIR THOSE ARE VERY NICE DRAWINGS BUT CAN WE GET BACK TO TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO MURDERED MY HUSBAND
LOOKS LIKE STEVEN AVERY TO ME BOYS LOCK HIM UP
WOW THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SKETCH RESEMBLES JEREMY BRETT THE BEST CHARACTERIZATION OF SH IMO
HONESTLY THESE PHOTOS SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF ME WHEN I LOOK AT THEM EYE TO EYE I ALMOST FEEL AS IF SHE IS GOING TO MOVE AND START TALKING TO ME
POLICE SKETCH ARTIST OVER EXAGGERATE EVERY DETAIL NONE OF THESE LOOK LIKE REAL PEOPLE THEY NEVER LOOK LIKE REAL PEOPLE WHEN YOU SEE THEM ON THE NEWS EITHER
ALL OF THEIR FACES SEEM TOO LONG AND OVAL TO ME
JACK LOOKED LIKE AN ALIEN BUT WITH HAIR HALACHA
I WONDER WHAT THE AUTHORS THINK OF THESE
DUNNO ABOUT THE SHERLOCK HOLMES SKETCH THE DESCRIPTION SAYS HIS JAW SHOULD BE SQUARE
THOSE DONT LOOK LIKE HUMANS
AYYOMAME
NURSE BATCHED AT THE TOP OF THE ARTICLE LOOKS LIKE MIKE IN STRANGER THINGS
HORSESHIT
I GUESS POLICE THINK EVERYONE LOOKS LIKE AN ALIEN
ALL ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN I AM EVEN THE MONSTER
I WANT TO SEE DRACULA DRAWN UP SO BADLY
I WANT BOAR
I CAN NEVER IMAGINE THURSDAY NEXT AS ANYONE OTHER THAN CATE BLANCHETT
THEY CHOSE THE WRONG
MENTALFLOSSDOTCOM CAN GO PISSUPAROPE WITH THAT AGGRESSIVE SITE
RIP MENTAL FLOSS MAGAZINE I JUST SUBSCRIBED TWO ISSUES AGO TOO
WOULD LOVE TO SEE AN INTERPERSONAL OF LISBETH BALANDER AND HER BACK DRAGON TATTOO
R BADCOMPOSITESKETCHES
R NOTTIMANDERIC
DAMN THE SHINING RENDING IS AMAZING THE REAL JACK ISN'T FAR OFF FROM THE BOOK JACK
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST BUT TORRANCE DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE A SERIAL KILLER
I WAS HOPING TO SEE HOLDEN CAUFIELD IN THERE USED TO HAVE A WEIRD CRUSH ON HIM AS A TEEN
FOR SOME REASON ALL OF THESE CHARACTERS LOOK LIKE WANTED CRIMINALS
IS THERE ONE FOR HERMIONE


AS A LINGUIST I'LL SAY THIS I NEVER CONSIDERED SKETCH ARTISTS TO BE ANYTHING LESS THAN PSYCHIC I DUNNO HOW THEY WORK BUT THEY SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL FOR LINGUISTICS FOR WHAT THEY DO
HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS IF ONLY I HAVE THE SKILL TO DRAW THE IMAGINATIONS I HAVE IN MY MIND
NOT SO MUCH SKETCHES AS ODDLY PROPORTIONED CONGLOMERATES OF FACIAL FEATURES
THERE IS SOMETHING DEEPLY DISTURBING ABOUT THESE SKETCHES I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT IS IT SOME UNCANNY VALLEY THING
WELL I NEVER THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS A NURSE BUT THAT PIC LOOKS A LOT LIKE ME
YEAH AND TRAVELING JACK WAS DEFINITELY LIKE SO WHY DID THEY DRAW HIM AS AN OLD ASS MANUAL
THEY KIND OF LOOK LIKE GRAY ALIENS THOUGH
THIS IS NOT WHAT I PICTURED THEM TO BE
A MONSTER SO UNSPEAKABLY HIDEOUS THAT IT CAUSES PEOPLE TO FAINT AND FALL SICK AND HATE IT INSTINCTIVELY APPARENTLY LOOKS LIKE STEVE COUSIN BECAUSE OF COURSE HE DOES
IF THE SKETCHES ARE THIS BAD HOW DO THEY EVER IDENTIFY ANYONE

ALSO THE ENTIRE HUMAN ANATOMY BREAKS WITH THOSE CHINS YOU COULD KILL PEOPLE WITH THAT POINT
THE POLICE USE EXAGGERATED EYES AND OTHER FEATURES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN REALLY RECOGNIZE THE PERSON IN THE IMAGE EYES AND NOSE ARE PROBABLY THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE FEATURES OF THE HUMAN FACE

SOURCE CSI
WHOEVER CAST BASIL RATHBONE AS SHERLOCK HOLMES DID A GOOD JOB
NONE OF THESE LOOK LIKE ACTUAL PEOPLE
TIL POLICE SKETCH ARTISTS LIKE SIDEBURNS
SO IN POLICE SKETCHES EVERYONE HAS A CRAZY SKINNY JAW
THAT'S NOT HOW FACES WORK
NOW I'M GOING TO SEE ALL THESE CREEPY FACES WHILE DREAMING TONIGHT
THESE ARE ALL TERRIBLE THEY BARELY LOOK LIKE PEOPLE AT ALL
I COULDN'T IMAGINE JACK TORRANCE AS ANYONE OTHER THAN NICHOLSON WHEN I READ THE BOOK THIS GUY LOOKS WRONG EVEN THOUGH I KNOW KING HATED PRETTY MUCH EVERY ASPECT OF THAT MOVIE HERE'S JOHNNY JACK IS THE GUY I SAW IN MY HEAD THE WHOLE TIME
THIS SPOILS IT FOR ME I LIKE TO USE MY IMAGINATION LIKE USING A STOCK IMAGE OUT OF THE WANK BANK
BRRR THIS SKETCH ARTIST MUST HAVE BEEN BRITISH
THICK DARK EYELASHES AND LIPS MAKE ALL OF THESE LOOK STRANGELY FEMININE I THINK FOR THE EYES IN PARTICULAR THERE'S SOME SORT OF TEMPLATE THAT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH NUANCE
THICK DARK EYE LASHES AND LIPS MAKE ALL THE PORTRAITS STRANGELY FEMININE I CHECKED IT OUT ON THE BLOG ITSELF ABOUT A DOZEN MORE PICS AND IT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT THE EYES IN PARTICULAR SEEM TO COME FROM A TEMPLATE AND THERE'S NOT MUCH NUANCE
WTF IS JAY GATSBY
NURSE BATCHED LOOKS LIKE ELEVEN
TIL HYDE WAS A SMALL OFF-CUTTING DUDE AND NOT SOME SAVAGE HULK MONSTER


WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT STORY ANYWAY
I ALWAYS PICTURED COMAMIE BEING RATHER MORE BEAUTIFUL
THESE LOOKS TERRIBLE OR IS THAT THE POINT THAT THE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE BOOKS ARE TERRIBLE
ANY POC WOULD MOST LIKELY JUST LOOK LIKE A STARBUCKS ORDER
I WISH THAT WE HAVE A SUBREDDIT FOR THIS KIND OF THING ALA REDDITGETSDRAWN EXCEPT FOR FICTIONAL LITERARY CHARACTERS YOU KNOW
THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE HERMIONE AND PUT TO REST THE QUESTION OF HER RACE S
LOOKS LIKE A SERIAL KILLER AND LOOKS LIKE WOMANS BONE STRUCTURE
CAME HERE TO SEE ROLAND
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE POINTY CHINS ARE THEY ANIME CHARACTERS
THE THUMBNAIL IS WHITE DOUBLELIFT WTF
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT SHE WOULD LOOK LIKE THAT IN
THE SHINING ONE WAS TOTALLY CHEATING HE GAVE THE DRAWING THE EXACT SAME HAIR AS NICHOLSON IN THE MOVIE FOR GOD'S SAKE
NONE OF THOSE EVEN LOOK HUMAN
JACK TORRANCE RENDERING LOOKS SCARIER THAN NICHOLSON
I WANNA SEE HARRY POTTER AND HAGRID
WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE COOLER
GOOD IDEA PRETTY DISAPPOINTING RESULTS THOUGH ARE THESE PHOTOS MUSHED TOGETHER WITH DRAWINGS
WHAT ARE THESE LONG-FACED ALIENS
I'M LOOKING AT THESE AT AND THE MONSTER IS THE LEAST FREAKIEST OF THE BUNCH
SO I GUESS POLICE SKETCHES ARE AUTOMATICALLY CREEPY REGARDLESS
JACK TORRANCE WILL ALWAYS LOOK LIKE JACK NICHOLSON TO ME AND DEFINITELY NOT THE GUY FROM WINGS
THEY ALL LOOK LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE TALKING HEADS
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM LOOK PSYCHOPATHIC
I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS DONE FOR TAYLOR HEBERT
I HAD NEVER READ THESE BOOKS EXCEPT ONE SHERLOCK HOLMES AND TO BE HONEST THAT IS EXACTLY THE PICTURE THAT WAS PAINTED IN MY MIND BY THE WORDS OF THE BOOK WELL DONE BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF POLICE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GET THINGS LIKE THIS DONE THEN WHO IS SERVING THE COMMUNITY I'M KIDDING DON'T HATE ME PLEASE I KNOW IT WAS JUST THEIR SKETCH ARTISTS
HERE ARE MORE COMPOSITES
CLICKED THIS POST LIKE ASSESS EVERYTHING I NEED IN MY LIFE RN BUT THE CHARACTER SELECTION DEPRESSED ME OUTSIDE OF MONSTER WHO LET'S BE HONEST LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE AN EXOTIC SHORTHAIR
WHY DOES MONSTER LOOK LIKE STEVE BUSCEMI
COMAMIE FROM IS DESCRIBED BY HER EXTREME PAUCITY OF EXPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE BOOK AS WELL BUT IN THE SKETCH THERE IS A STRONG EXPRESSION OF ANGER CONFUSION ON HER FACE
THEY ALL LOOK UGLY
MORE HUMAN THAN HUMAN
I'M READ RIGHT NOW IN OTHER NEWS CAN WE GET PAY SOMEONE TO DO THIS FOR EVERY BOOK
JACK TORRANCE IS MORE FRIGHTENING THAN THE MONSTER LOL
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES THE MONSTER LOOK LIKE STEVE BUSCEMI
WHY ARE THEY ALL MALE CHARACTERS
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME THIS SKETCH ARTIST DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRAW PEOPLE TO LOOK LIKE ANYONE OTHER THAN HIMSELF
R CLICKBAIT
TALKING ABOUT CHARACTERS IN FICTION WHAT JESUS WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE JEBUS HETP
REMOVED
MATES PLEASE READ THE ARTICLE AS WELL AS WATCH THE PICTURES HALF THE PEOPLE HERE SEEM TO HAVE MISSED THE FACT THAT ALL OF THESE WERE MADE BY A COMPUTER THE THIN NECKS AND FEMININE LIPS ARE THE RESULT OF A COMPUTER NOT BEING PERFECT
I WOULD TAKE THESE WITH A GRAIN A SALT SEEING AS THOUGH A POLICE SKETCH HAS NEVER LED TO AN ARREST
I'M OBSESSED WITH THE QUEEN'S THIEF SERIES BY MEGAN WHALEN TURNER BUT I FEEL LIKE NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT THEM THE WRITING IS STELLAR YOU'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH THE CHARACTERS AND THE PLOTS ARE COMPLEX AND DEEPLY SATISFYING I RECOMMEND THEM TO EVERYONE I CAN THE FIRST BOOK IS MUCH SIMPLER THAN THE REST BUT STILL GREAT AND THEY JUST GET BETTER AND BETTER AS YOU MOVE THROUGH THE SERIES

THE GREENLANDER BY JANE SMILEY WELL-KNOWN AUTHOR PROBABLY ONE OF HER BOOKS RELATES THE FINAL YEARS OF THE GREENLAND COLONY BEFORE ITS COLLAPSE TOLD IN THE MANNER OF THE NORSE SAGAS ABSORBING IN MY OPINION HER MASTERPIECE MUCH HISTORICAL FACT TO BACK IT UP A SECTION OF JARED DIAMOND'S COLLAPSE COVERS THE SAME PERIOD AND IS A GOOD FOLLOW-UP

LAST YEAR I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE TRYSMOON SAGA BY BRIAN FULLER IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FANTASY BOOK GREAT READ
THE ALCHEMIST BY PAULO COELHO
WHEN I'M IN A BOOKSTORE SECOND-HAND SHOP AND SOMEONE'S HOGGING THE AISLE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES READING THROUGH A BOOK WITHOUT MOVING

LENDING SOMEONE A BOOK AND NOT GETTING IT BACK STOPPED THAT PRACTICE YEARS AGO AFTER PEOPLE GOT TOO FORGETFUL NOW IF A FRIEND IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING I USUALLY JUST BUY IT FOR THEM AND GIVE IT TO THEM PERMANENTLY

PEOPLE IN SECOND-HAND SHOPS WHO GRAB HANDFULS OF BOOKS WITH THE INTENT TO SORT THEM OUT BUY THEM MUCH LATER LEAVING PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WANTED TO PICK UP THE BOOK AND SEE WHAT IT'S ABOUT AT A LOSS
WHEN PEOPLE DON'T TAKE CARE OF THEM DON'T DOG EAR THEM DON'T BREAK THE SPINE IF YOU CAN HELP IT AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE THE DUST JACKET OFF IF YOU'RE GONNA CARRY IT AROUND IN YOUR BAG I'VE ACTUALLY STARTED KEEPING THE DUST JACKETS IF I LEND SOMEONE A BOOK

YOU MAY NOT CARE WHAT YOUR BOOKS LOOK LIKE OR YOU MAY PREFER THAT THEY LOOKED USED AND LOVED AND READ BROKEN SPINE AND DOG EARED PAGES RIPPED DUST JACKETS AND THAT'S FINE YOU LIKE YOUR BOOKS THE WAY YOU LIKE THEM AND I CAN LIKE THEM THE WAY I LIKE THEM AND THAT IS LOOKING LIKE THEY JUST CAME OFF THE SHELF AT THE BOOKSTORE


WHEN I LEND A BOOK TO SOMEONE ONLY TO HAVE THEM BEND THE COVER BACK LIKE IT'S A MAGAZINE

WHEN I LEND A BOOK TO SOMEONE ONLY TO HAVE IT RETURNED ONLY HALF READ AND IN SEVERAL PIECES

YEAH I DON'T LEND BOOKS OUT ANYMORE
ASSUME THAT IF I HAVE A BOOK THAT IS DAMAGED THEN IT'S NOT IMPORTANT
SURE MAYBE THAT BOOK LOOKS LIKE A TATTERED LITTLE PAPERBACK TO YOU BUT IT WAS THE VERY FIRST PRESENT MY VERY FIRST BOYFRIEND GOT ME WHEN WE LIVED LIKE A THOUSAND MILES FROM EACH OTHER IT MOVED WITH ME I LOVE THAT DAMN THING
NOPE YOU CAN'T KEEP IT NOPE I'M NOT THROWING IT AWAY YES IT DOES MATTER TO ME AND HELL YES I WILL KICK YOUR ASS IF YOU LOSE IT OR SOMETHING

OFTEN IT FEELS LIKE PEOPLE ONLY SEE BOOKS AS EXPENSIVE TRENDY THINGS TO KEEP AROUND AND THEY FORGET ABOUT ANY SENTIMENTAL VALUE OR ENJOYMENT OF THE STORY
IF ANYTHING BELOVED DAMAGED COPIES ARE CLOSER TO MY HEART THAN THOSE BRAND NEW SHINY UNTOUCHED HARDBACKS
I HATE THAT NO ONE READS MY BOOKS THE SOCIAL CONQUEST OF EARTH IS INTERESTING DANG IT
WHEN PEOPLE AKA MY LITTLE SISTER TAKE BOOKS FROM MY SHELVES AND THEN EITHER DON'T PUT THEM BACK OR PUT THEM BACK SOMEWHERE COMPLETELY RANDOM THERE IS AN ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEM AND IT'S REALLY ANNOYING WHEN I HAVE TO GO SEARCHING THROUGH THE WHOLE COLLECTION BECAUSE SOMEONE PUT A MEMOIR IN THE SCIENCE FICTION
I DON'T LOAN ANYONE MY BOOKS BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DON'T CARE AS MUCH ABOUT THEM AS I DO I ALSO WOULD BE TERRIFIED OF NEVER GETTING THEM BACK
I HATE IT WHEN I'M READING AND SOMEBODY TRIES TO HAVE A FULL BLOWN CONVERSATION WITH ME IT JUST IRKS THE SHIT OUT OF ME
I'M REALLY PARTICULAR ABOUT HOW I KEEP MY BOOKS IF I LEND ONE TO SOMEONE I WANT IT BACK IN THE EXACT SAME CONDITION I GAVE IT TO YOU IN

THAT MEANS DON'T BEND THE FUCKING PAGES USE A BOOKMARK

IF IT'S A SOFT COVER BOOK DO NOT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD BREAK THE BINDING BY BENDING THE BOOK COMPLETELY IN HALF AS YOU'RE READING

ALSO IF YOU FUCK MY BOOK UP OR LOSE IT YOU CAN GET ME A NEW ONE

I'VE ALWAYS FELT BAD BEING SO STRICT ON THAT STUFF BUT I REALLY LIKE TO KEEP MY BOOKS NICE
AFTER ALSO NOT GETTING SOME BOOKS BAG I NOW ONLY LEND THEM STUFF IF THEY ALSO HAVE STUFF I WANT TO READ
LENDING SOMEONE A BOOK AND THEY RETURN IT WITH THE SPINE FULL OF CREASES
DON'T MOVE MY BOOKS AROUND THEY ARE IN SPECIFIC ORDER ILLOGICAL TO YOU PERHAPS BUT THOSE ARE MY BOOKSHELVES DON'T TAKE MY BOARDING PASSES OUT OF MY BOOKS I DO MOST OF MY READING AT FEET I FLY WEEKLY FOR WORK AND DON'T D SIGH JUST DON'T TOUCH MY BOOKS OKAY

MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY TITLES ARE HOLIDAYS ON ICE BY DAVID SEDARIM AND THE STUPIDEST ANGEL A HEARTWARMING TALE OF CHRISTMAS TERROR BY CHRISTOPHER MOORE I ALSO TEND TO THE GUIDE TO THE GALAXY AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR TOO

MY FAMILY IS VERY RELIGIOUS HOWEVER I AM NOT AND I FIND THAT READING HUMOR DURING THIS TIME OF THE YEAR HELPS MY BRAIN DEAL WITH ALL THE SUBTLE RELIGIOUS GUILT TRIPS THEY GIVE ME THE REST OF THE YEAR I READ MORE SERIOUS STUFF BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY THE SEASON WERE I WANT TO JUST RELAX AND LAUGH
I'VE BEEN PLANNING A OF ALL HARRY POTTER'S THIS HOLIDAY SEASON
I'M GOING THROUGH ONE RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A HEAVY READER BUT RECENTLY I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH SOME REALLY HARD TIME MENTALLY AND GOING TO COLLEGE ISN'T HELPING MUCH I HAVEN'T READ MORE THAN S CHAPTER OF A BOOK IN ABOUT TWO YEARS
I STUDIED FOR THE BAR EXAM FROM READING ALL DAY LEFT ME WITH NO DESIRE TO READ AT NIGHT I FLUNKED THE BAR EXAM SO UNTIL FEBRUARY I PROBABLY WON'T BE READING MUCH FOR FUN SAD
READ HEAPS OF SCI FI FANTASY IN MY ALL NON FICTION IN MY AND NOW MIXING BETWEEN THE TWO MY MY NEXT BIG MOVE IS TO ACTUALLY WRITE
ALWAYS BEEN AN AVID READER BUT UNIVERSITY KILLED READING FOR AMUSEMENT DIDN'T READ A SINGLE FICTION NOVEL FOR YEARS BROKE THE TREND THE DAY AFTER GRADUATION WITH EOIN PLUGGED
GREW UP READING A TON I'M HAVEN'T FINISHED A BOOK SINCE I WAS
MARRIAGE KILLED MY READING HABITS FOR YEARS AS MY WIFE ACTED LIKE READING WAS AND FORCED ME TO WATCH TV ALL THE TIME SO WE COULD SHARE THANKFULLY WE ARE DIVORCED AND I AM CAUGHT UP ON MY BOOK QUEUE
FOR PLEASURE COLLEGE ALL OF COLLEGE

BUT I DID READ DURING THAT TIME AS WE HAD TO READ PLAYS AND TEXT FOR CLASSES
STARTING MY FIRST JOB ONLY READ DURING TIME OFF FOR HOLIDAYS ETC FOR A LONG TIME
I READ A LOT AS A CHILD AND AS A TEENAGER AND FROM DIDN'T READ A LOT INSTEAD FOCUSED ON MUSIC FILMS TV STUFF ON YOUTUBE ETC

COMING BACK TO READING TO MY HORROR I NOTICED IT WAS REALLY HARD TO BEGIN AGAIN IT WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THINGS IN MY HEAD AND RETAIN KNOWLEDGE WHEREAS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER PUSHING MYSELF THROUGH THIS IT GETS EASIER BUT I AM AWARE THAT IT BROUGHT MY READING LEVEL RIGHT DOWN BY A FEW YEARS LIKE NOT PLAYING AN INSTRUMENT OR SPEAKING ANOTHER LANGUAGE IT TOOK AGES FOR ME TO GET BETTER AGAIN READING IS A SKILL

MY ADVICE JUST DON'T STOP READING HAVE A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF WHAT YOU CAN READ PER WEEK OR MONTH KEEP YOUR SKILL HONED
AFTER MY MOTHER'S DEATH I DIDN'T READ A BOOK FOR THREE TO FOUR MONTHS GRIEF HAS BEEN THE ONLY THING TO KEEP A BOOK OUT OF MY HAND
WHEN I WAS SUPER BUSY WITH UNI AND WHEN I WAS EXTREMELY DEPRESSED THE DEPRESSED ONE BOTHERED ME THE MOST AS I HAD THE TIME TO READ BUT I JUST COULDN'T FOCUS OR REMEMBER WELL ENOUGH IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING TO TRY TO READ AS IT WAS ANOTHER REMINDER THAT I COULDN'T ENJOY ANYTHING
WELL FOR A LONG TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE CABLE OR INTERNET SO I READ EVERY DAY BUT I RECENTLY GOT A NICE COMPUTER AND DRAWING TABLET A WITH NETFLIX AND HULU SO I'VE BEEN PRETTY DISTRACTED THAT WAS LIKE MONTHS AGO I WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF BOOK OF ASOAIF I GOT THE ENTIRE SERIES SO FAR USED ONLINE FOR LIKE IT WAS A GREAT DEAL BUT I HAVE TO ROAD TRIP WITH FAMILY FOR THE HOLIDAYS AND I WAS PLANNING ON TAKING IT
MONTHS CERTAINLY BUT I VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT IT'S EVER BEEN OVER A YEAR

I DO RECALL MOVING INTO A LARGE SHABBY OLD FLAT AT THE END OF A TURBULENT SERIES OF EVENTS AND BEING ALONE HAVING QUITE SOME UNINTERRUPTED TIME AHEAD OF ME I SHELVED ALL MY BOOKS IN ONE ROOM OVERLOOKING THE UNKEMPT SPRAWL OF A GARDEN SET UP A BAGGILY COMFORTABLE WINGCHAIR AND FOOTSTOOL IN THE MIDDLE PLACED A SIDE TABLE FOR DRINKS AND BISCUITS TO ONE SIDE OF IT AND ALL OF THE HORNBLOWER BOOKS TO THE OTHER AND PROCEEDED TO READ THROUGH THEM ALL OVER THE COURSE OF A FEW WEEKS AFTER FAR TOO LONG A GAP

THAT WAS DEFINITELY A HAPPY RETURN TO READING
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL WE HAD A THING WHERE WE HAD TO READ BOOKS ANY BOOKS THAT THE SCHOOL LIBRARY HAD AND TAKE TESTS ABOUT THEM ON THE SCHOOL COMPUTERS THIS KIND OF KILLED THE JOY OF READING FOR ME FOR A WHILE I WAS ABLE TO PICK BOOKS THAT I LIKED BUT BEING FORCED TO READ WASN'T FUN EVEN IF IT WAS A GOOD BOOK SO I PRETTY MUCH JUST DID THE BARE MINIMUM

READ A GOOD BIT IN MY FIRST TWO YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL THEN KINDA DROPPED OFFICIAL GRADUATED IN READ MAYBE A BOOK OR TWO A YEAR SINCE THEN UNTIL THIS PAST SUMMER MY BROTHER GOT ME INTO PHILIP KING DICK AND I TORE THROUGH MOST OF HIS WORK GOT A KINDLE IN SEPTEMBER AND I'VE BEEN READING PRETTY MUCH SINCE
YES HAD MY FIRST KID IN THE SECOND IN NO TIME TO READ WHILE DOING THE DAYCARE SHUFFLE AUDIBLE REVOLUTIONIZED MY LIFE CIRCA STILL A GOLD SUBSCRIBER
I'LL START SO I'VE BEEN HAVING A LACK OF FOCUS FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS OF SO AND I HADN'T READ ANY BOOK UNTIL THE LAST WEEK WHEN I READ THE WELL-KNOWN THE GUIDE TO THE GALAXY BY DOUGLAS ADAMS
RESPONSIBILITIES AND INTERESTS FLUCTUATE BUT I ALWAYS LIKE A GOOD BOOK

ALSO SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR A GREAT AUTHOR SERIES TO PUT OUT ANOTHER BOOK OR TWO
RIGHT NOW BOUGHT A HOUSE GOT A SHIPLOAD OF WORK TO DO BEFORE ITS FINISHED SOMEHOW I CAN'T GET MYSELF TO READ
MAYBE WHEN IT IS FINISHED I CAN FIND THE TIME AGAIN
I'VE BEEN READING NOTHING REALLY NEW RECENTLY I'VE REREAD BOOKS I LOVE BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY BRANCHED OUT IN TERMS OF AUTHOR OR SERIES
MY GAPS ENTERED EXISTENCE AT THE SAME TIME THAT MY KIDS DID I USED TO READ EVERY DAY MOTHERHOOD AND HOUSEWIFERY SCARED AWAY THE BOOKWORM FOR MONTHS AT A TIME NOW I AM BEGINNING TO JUMP BACK INTO IT
I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD IT GO AS LONG AS A YEAR BUT I'VE HAD A FEW MONTHS WHERE I HAVEN'T READ A BOOK BECAUSE OF SCHOOL I'VE NOTICED I FOLLOW A PATTERN WHERE I TEND TO READ MORE AROUND CHRISTMAS AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER WHEN CLASSES HAVE RECENTLY FINISHED
ASSUMING WE COUNT TEXTBOOKS THAT LEAVES AGES AND
I WENT THROUGH A SERIOUS DEPRESSIVE EPISODE IN COLLEGE AND STOPPED READING I PLAYED SOLITAIRE ON MY IPOD TOUCH INSTEAD OF READING FOR MY TRAIN RIDE THAT I TOOK TWICE A DAY TO GET TO SCHOOL AND BACK BECAUSE I LITERALLY COULDN'T FOCUS LONG ENOUGH TO PUT TWO SENTENCES TOGETHER THIS ALSO MADE SCHOOLWORK QUITE DIFFICULT IT TOOK AWHILE TO GET READ A LOT OF GRAPHIC NOVELS AND KIDS FANTASY FOR AWHILE TO JUST BE READING SOMETHING BECAUSE I WAS STILL READING A PAGE AND THEN SWITCHING TO TWITTER OR WHATEVER BECAUSE MY ATTENTION SPAN WAS SO THIS YEAR I'VE FINALLY BEEN READING WHOLE GROWNUP NOVELS ON THE COUCH AFTER DINNER INSTEAD OF WATCHING ENTIRE SEASONS OF THE BIGGEST LOSER IN ONE SITTING

I THINK SOUTH BY DOUG DORST WAS THE FIRST BOOK THAT GOT ME BACK TO BEING ABLE TO FOCUS ON READING FOR LONGER THAN MINUTES AT A TIME NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT
DURING COLLEGE AND A YEAR OR SO AFTER I DID NOT READ ANY BOOKS FOR ENJOYMENT

WRITING PAPERS AND READING CHEMISTRY BOOKS FOR SCHOOL DRAINED ME WHEN I NEEDED A MENTAL BREAK READING A BOOK FOR ENJOYMENT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A GOOD OPTION AT ALL I'D GO TO NETFLIX OR SOME REALITY TV SHOW TO GIVE MYSELF A BREAK
I THINK I'VE PROBABLY GONE AT MOST TWO WEEKS WITHOUT READING A BOOK SINCE I FIRST LEARNED TO READ IT'S BEEN MY ONLY HOBBY FOR DECADES
DURING MY LAST YEAR OF COLLEGE I READ SEVERAL NOVELS EVERY MONTH IN ADDITION TO MY CLASS READING LIST I LOVE READING AND WAS BECOMING ADDICTED TO CHECKING THRIFT STORES HALF PRICE BOOKS AND MY LIBRARY FOR CHEAP BOOKS THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY WOULD BE NICE NOW THAT I GOT MY FIRST REAL JOB I HAVE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE READING EVEN IF I HAVE EXTRA TIME ANY SUGGESTIONS OF WHAT TO DO I AM CURRENTLY SITTING AT PAGE OF THE MILES DAVIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS FEELS BAD MAN
COLLEGE SO YEARS PROBLEM SETS HANGING OUT AND SLEEPING ALL SEEMED MORE IMPORTANT THAN READING AT THE TIME AFTER GRADUATION A FEW MONTHS AGO I READ THE MARTIAN AND GOT BACK INTO READING IT STILL TAKES ME ABOUT A MONTH TO FINISH A BOOK IF I EVEN FINISH IT BUT ITS BETTER THAN NOT READING AT ALL
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN AVID ABOUT A BOOK DAY THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL DURING COLLEGE I COMPLETELY STOPPED READING FOR FUN DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR IN HINDSIGHT EVEN THOUGH I WAS EXHAUSTED I SHOULD HAVE KEPT READING PROBABLY WOULD HAVE KILLED MY STRESS AS SOON AS I WAS DONE WITH SCHOOL I BEGAN READING ABOUT BOOK A WEEK NOTHING LIKE I USED TO BUT MORE IF I HAVE THE TIME OR ENERGY
I BARELY READ AT ALL FOR FUN IN HIGH SCHOOL BETWEEN HAVING HOURS A DAY ON THE BUS A MUCH HEAVIER COURSE LOAD AND DISCOVERING THE WONDERS OF TV SHOWS IT JUST WASN'T A PRIORITY I THINK I READ A BIT ESPECIALLY DURING SUMMER HOLIDAYS BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I GOT TO UNI THAT I REALLY GOT BACK INTO READING
I WAS READING QUITE A BIT DURING THE SUMMER THIS YEAR AND MY MOTHER IN LAW PASSED UNEXPECTEDLY I STOPPED READING COMPLETELY FOR ABOUT A MONTH WHICH SEEMED HUGE BECAUSE IT WAS MY MAIN HOBBY IN MY LIFE WAS TOO EMOTIONALLY TUMULTUOUS FOR ME TO ADD FAKE EMOTIONS INTO IT I DIDN'T VIEW BOOKS AS AN ESCAPE BUT AS MORE PEOPLE FOR ME TO GET ATTACHED TO AND I JUST DIDN'T WANT IT

MY NEXT BOOK WAS LANDLINE BY RAINBOW ROWELL AND I READ IT BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY EASY BRAINLESS READ THAT WOULDN'T TEAR ME TO SHREDS

OTHER THAN THAT I ALSO TEND TO STOP READING WHEN MY HUSBAND GETS HOME FROM DEPLOYMENTS OR WHILE I'M TAKING ANY CLASSES
YEAH THERE ARE TIMES I HAVEN'T READ AT ALL BUT THAT WAS THE TIME I'M GOING THROUGH DEPRESSION

THERE ARE TIMES I READ LESS LIKE CHAPTER PER WEEK OR SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED TO READ BUT GOING TO COLLEGE BEAT IT OUT OF ME IT TOOK ABOUT TWO YEARS AFTER I GRADUATED BEFORE I STARTED TO ENJOY READING AGAIN
DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR LIKE RIGHT NOW I'M ALWAYS BUSY STUDYING AND DOING WORK FOR SCHOOL SO I FEEL GUILTY WHENEVER I'M READING SOMETHING FOR PLEASURE I HAVEN'T FINISHED A BOOK SINCE AUGUST WHEN I DO HAVE SOME FREE TIME USUALLY AT NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO BED I USUALLY SPEND IT PLAYING VIDEO GAMES WITH FRIENDS OR TALKING IT REALLY DEPENDS THOUGH LAST SEMESTER I WAS GREAT WITH READING EVEN THOUGH I WAS SWAMPED WITH STUDYING AND STILL PLAYED GAMES ETC I ALWAYS HAD A BOOK FOR LEISURE READING IN MY BAG WHEREVER I WENT AND WOULD PICK IT UP AND READ WHENEVER I HAD A FREE MOMENT ON CAMPUS OR ELSEWHERE I ENDED UP READING BOOKS OR SO JUST DURING THAT SEMESTER WHICH SHOWS IT'S POSSIBLE TO FIND TIME TO READ EVEN WHEN YOU'RE BUSY I THINK RIGHT NOW I'M IN A SLUMP BECAUSE I'M STUCK IN A VERY LONG BOOK IT'S VERY GOOD THAT I CAN'T BE BOTHERED CARRYING AROUND

I FEEL LIKE I DIDN'T READ AS MUCH IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR SOME REASON WHICH IS ODD BECAUSE I HAD FREE TIME AND
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I DID SO MUCH READING BUT IT WAS ONLY SCHOOL STUFF HISTORIC AND SCIENTIFIC STUFF STUDIED ARCHAEOLOGY AND I DIDN'T HAVE TIME AND ENERGY TO READ BOOKS THAT I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN RIGHT AFTER FINISHING COLLEGE I WAS BACK ON TRACK
WHEN I WAS AND SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION I DIDN'T READ FOR THREE MONTHS I'M PRETTY SURE I READ LOLITA JUST AFTER
I AM SORT OF IN SUCH A SPOT RIGHT NOW

I STILL READ USUALLY ABOUT 2 BOOKS A MONTH BUT THIS IS MUCH LESS THAN IN THE PAST

BUT I HAVE READ THE CLASSICS AND ALL THE STUFF THAT IS BEALL FAMOUS AND EVEN THE NOT SO FAMOUS ONES BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE SCIFI AND FANTASY AREA IT IS REALLY HARD TO FIND MORE GOOD STUFF TO READ

SADLY WRITERS LIKE TZOLKIN MARTIN GIBSON HEINLEIN BRADBURY CLARKE PRITCHETT GADMANN MOORCOCK DON T EXIST BY THE DOZEN
AFTER READING EVERYTHING I COULD GET MY HANDS ON FROM I STOPPED FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I JUST BECAME SO FOCUSED ON SPORTS MEETING GIRLS MAKING FRIENDS AND TRYING TO SCORE BOOZE ON WEEKENDS I KIND OF THINK I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN AS A BOOKWORM IT DIDN'T FIT MY IMAGE OF WHO I THOUGHT I WANTED TO BE AT THE TIME IT TOOK ME UNTIL SOPHOMORE YEAR OF COLLEGE TO REALIZE THAT WAS MORE OF THE REAL ME THAN THE GUY PLAYING FOOTBALL OR WHATEVER AS COOL AS I WAS TRYING TO SEEM IN REALITY I WAS TOO INSECURE TO BRING A BOOK TO SCHOOL AND READ IT AT LUNCH LIKE I'D DONE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND EARLY HS AND SUFFERED FOR ON OCCASION
THERE HAVE BEEN DRY SPELLS SINCE THEN BUT NEVER REALLY MORE THAN A MONTH OR SO
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WOULD REALLY BE CONSIDERED A TIME GAP PER SE BUT I READ CONSTANTLY AND ALMOST EVERY FALL I SPEND A MONTH OR SO BEING OVERWHELMED WHERE I DON'T ACTUALLY FINISH ANY BOOKS USUALLY SOMEONE WILL RECOMMEND SOME READING FLUFF AND I'LL START THERE AND I USUALLY DON'T LIKE WHATEVER FLUFF I PICKED BUT AT LEAST I'VE STARTED READING AGAIN AND SO IT'S EASIER TO PICK UP THE NEXT THING
I AM TRYING TO PULL MYSELF OUT OF ONE NOW I LOVE READING BOOKS BUT THE LAST FEW YEARS I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO INVEST IN READING AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO CURRENTLY READING THE DARK TOWER SERIES MAYBE AFTER THAT THE DRESDEN FILES
I LIKED WHAT LEO BROUGHT TO THE CHARACTER


I READ THE BOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL SO I COULDN'T QUITE GRASP THE CONCEPT OF A TORTURED SOUL CURSED WITH EXCESSIVE WEALTH AS A LESS THAN WEALTHY TEENAGE GIRL


WHEN I WATCHED THE MOVIE I REALIZED THAT GATSBY WAS STILL CRAZY BUT ALSO PASSIONATE AND EXTREMELY SYMPATHETIC ALBEIT OVER THE TOP IN REGARDS TO LOVE



THAT SCENE WHERE HE WALKS OUT AND LEAVES NICK STANDING THERE LIKE IT WAS HIS SURPRISE FOR DAISY WAS HILARIOUS SUCH A GREAT MOMENT I DIDN'T GET FROM THE BOOK


BOOKSHOP PHOTOBOOK
I REREAD THE BOOK A FEW MONTHS AGO IT IS SO HONEST ABOUT GRIEF I LOVE THE STORIES THE MONSTER TELLS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT MOVIE I HOPE THEY CAN CAPTURE THE LEVEL OF DEVASTATION IN THE BOOK
THIS BOOK DESTROYED ME IT WAS SUCH A GREAT MODERN FABLE
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH PRAISE FOR THIS BOOK BUT ALSO SO MUCH ABOUT HOW HEARTBREAKING IT IS I WANT TO READ IT BUT I'M NOT EMOTIONALLY PREPARED
I READ IT FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR I EXPECTED SOME KIND OF HALLOWEEN KIDS BOOK I WAS TOTALLY WRONG BUT TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY I CRIED WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HEARTRENDING TRUE BOOK
I PICKED THIS UP AT RANDOM LAST WEEK IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY WHILE MY STUDENTS WERE SITTING THROUGH A LESSON WITH OUR LIBRARIANS THE NEXT DAY I HAD TO STAY HOME WITH MY SICK DAUGHTER AND READ THE WHOLE THING IN ONE SITTING I HARDLY EVER GET CHOKED UP DURING EMOTIONAL KIND OF A JOKE BETWEEN MY WIFE AND ME THAT I AM A HEARTLESS BASTARD AND SHE HAD TO MAKE UP THE BALANCE BY CRYING OVER TAMPON COMMERCIALS I WAS TOTALLY GUTTED BY THE END OF THE STORY THE COOL THING IS THAT THE STORY IS SO AFFECTING NOT BECAUSE OF ANY TRICKERY OR GIMMICKS IT'S JUST TRUE

BY TRUE I DON'T MEAN THAT IT IS NONFICTION I MEAN THAT IT FEELS LIKE AN AUTHENTIC REPRESENTATION OF WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE HUMAN

I GOOGLED THE TITLE SO I COULD GIVE MY STUDENTS A LITTLE PRESENTATION I LIKE TO GIVE AN ELEVATOR PITCH TO MY STUDENTS WHEN I FIND A BOOK I THINK THEY'LL LIKE AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT IT'S BEEN MADE INTO A MOVIE HOW HAD I NOT HEARD OF IT BEFORE
PAGE NESS
I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL THE AUTHOR REALLY CAUGHT THE PROCESS AND DIFFICULTIES OF GOING THROUGH GRIEF AT ANY AGE THE INTRICACIES OF TYING HIS MONSTER AND THE STORIES TO LESSONS IN THE REAL WORLD REALLY POPPED THROUGH I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE
THIS BOOK WAS INCREDIBLY HEART BREAKING BUT I LOVED EVERY PAGE
MY FAVORITE BOOK
I DON'T HAVE TO READ THE ARTICLE TO KNOW THAT THE SEQUEL TO FIFTY SHADES OF BAD WRITING HAS TO BE ON THE LIST
HAVING A TEENAGER OR EVEN A CHILD AS A PROTAGONIST ISN'T WHAT MAKES A BOOK YA YA BOOKS ARE WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUNGER AUDIENCES AND GENERALLY FEATURE EASIER PROSE AND WORD CHOICE
IT'S A GENRE BENDER
I WOULD SAY BASED ON YOUR DESCRIPTION THAT IT WOULD BE OR PERHAPS THE UMBRELLA OF JUST FANTASY OR

REMEMBER THAT SOME OF THE BEST STORIES CAN NOT BE DEFINED BY JUST ONE SPECIFIC GENRE AND YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH UNTIL IT IS FINISHED
WHICH GENRE LABEL S WOULD YOU SAY FITS IT BEST MAYBE ONE OR TWO DOMINATE OR STAND OUT MORE THAN THE OTHERS THEN AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH CALLING IT DYSTOPIAN YA SCI-FI FANTASY HORROR
SOUNDS LIKE DYSTOPIAN YA OR JUST A STRAIGHT OUT SUPERHERO STORY WHICH IS KIND OF IT'S OWN THING BUT THEY ALL END UP IN SCIFI OR FANTASY DEPENDING ON THE TONE AND WRITING STYLE AND PLOT DYSTOPIAN IMPLIES SCIFI AND CAN INCLUDE MUTANTS TECHNOLOGY AND HORRORS BUT THE POWERS AND GHOULS MIGHT PUSH IT INTO DARK FANTASY UNLESS THERE IS SOME KIND OF HANDWAVY SCIENCE BEHIND WHERE THEY CAME FROM RADIOACTIVE SPIDERS MUTANTS ALIENS YA IS JUST AN AGE BRACKET FOR MARKETING

JUST FINISH IT AND THEN WORRY ABOUT GENRE LET YOUR BETA READERS TELL YOU WHAT THEY THINK
MMMM I'D SAY DYSTOPIAN YA IMHO
A GOOD IDEA I SUPPOSE BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD AT LEAST SORT BY GENRE SO THAT IT WOULD SUGGEST BOOKS IN A GENRE THAT YOU READ
WHY DO YOU NOT LINK DIRECTLY TO THE PAGE INSTEAD OF LEADING US THROUGH THE VERGE
OF THE BOOKS ARE PUBLIC ACCESS CLASSICS THAT GET POSTED HERE EVERYDAY

ASIDE FROM A MURAKAMI WORK I FOUND NOTHING NEW
SURPRISINGLY GOOD FUN YOU CLICK ON A LINK AND GET THE FIRST PAGE OF ONE OF THE CHOSEN BOOKS YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND IT'S INTERESTING TO TRY KNOWING NEITHER TITLE NOR AUTHOR AND WITH ZERO MARKETING AND PACKAGING
IT WAS FUN MY FIRST BOOK WAS ANIMAL FARM AND I RECOGNISED IT IMMEDIATELY

SECOND WAS LES MIS WHICH WAS AGAIN RECOGNISED I MIGHT TRY AGAIN LATER
EXCEPT SCI-FI

COVERS USUALLY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THOSE BUT ARE GENERALLY PRETTY AWESOME ARTS
PRETTY NICE
THIS FEELS MORE LIKE GUESS THE BOOK THAN A RECOMMENDATION SERVICE THE 1ST ONE I GOT WAS THE MARTIAN AND THE THIRD WAS THE HOBBIT WHO WOULD BE REMOTELY INTERESTED IN THIS SERVICE AND NOT ALREADY KNOW THOSE BOOKS
HE IS WILLING TO DO EVERYTHING BY HIMSELF BUT I WONDER DO YOU KNOW ANY PLACE WHERE YOU COULD ORDER THAT KIND OF PERSONALIZED BOOK

MEANING HANDWRITTEN I'D EXPECT SUCH A SERVICE TO COST A WHOLE LOT IT MUST TAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF HOURS TO WRITE AN ENTIRE BOOK WITH QUALITY HANDWRITING
THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS TO WRITE ON SINGLE PAGES AND LATER SEND THEM TO SOME COMPANY WHO CAN BIND IT INTO A BOOK

WRITING INTO A BLANK BOOK IS VERY RISKY BECAUSE YOU CAN T MAKE ANY MISTAKE BECAUSE YOU CAN T JUST TOSS THE PAGE
YOU POSE SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS IN YOUR POST ESPECIALLY THE ONE RELATED TO ORAL HISTORY HOW DO YOU VERIFY ORAL HISTORY SOURCES
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE PART OF THE RESEARCH PROCESS DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE WELL RECEIVED AS A WHITE GUY RESEARCHING A PART OF AMERICAN BLACK HISTORY
REMOVED
OUT OF CURIOSITY WHAT DO YOU LIKE SO MUCH ABOUT THE NOVEL IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE THE ODD ONE OUT IN THE HEMINGWAY CANON TO ME NOT IN THE WRITING STYLE BUT JUST IN THE THEMES AND PLOT IT REALLY JARRED NEXT TO THE OTHER BOOKS FOR ME THAT IT ONLY REALLY MADE SENSE TO ME AS A KIND OF IRONIC NOVEL
THE MOVIE WOULD NEVER BE AS GOOD AS THE BOOK STYLE LEAVES SO MUCH FOR THE READER TO INTERPRET THEMSELVES THAT A FILM WOULD MISS OUT ON
COCAINE AND OR MORPHINE SHERLOCK WAS A DRUGGIE AND WATSON WAS HIS ENABLER

IF YOU WANT STUFF THAT WON'T GET YOU KILLED IN THE PHILIPPINES SHERLOCK PLAYED VIOLIN AND HAD LOTS OF REFERENCE BOOKS HE HAS USED A CANE AS A WEAPON TOO BUT THAT WOULD SEEM INSULTING TO SOMEONE EVEN IF THEY NEEDED A CANE
I DON'T THINK HOLMES WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE GIFTS MUCH IF WATSON GAVE HIM ANYTHING IT WOULD BE SOMETHING USEFUL LIKE A NEW PIPE OR TOBACCO NEITHER OF THOSE WOULD MAKE A GOOD GIFT FOR MOST PEOPLE TODAY
MAYBE A NICE PEN HOLMES MIGHT APPRECIATE THAT AS PRACTICAL

IS YOU BOSS A READER WHAT ABOUT A NICE EDITION OF THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES OR THE COLLECTED WORKS OF SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
EXPLAIN THE PARTNERSHIP OR THE PERSON
IF YOU GO TO THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY GREAT BRITAIN NOT USA YOU CAN ORDER PRINTS OF ANY OF THE IMAGES THEY HAVE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF SIZES AND FORMATS AVAILABLE

THERE IS ONE OF HOLMES BUT NO IMAGE AVAILABLE THERE ARE SEVERAL PHOTOS OF DOYLE
THERE'S THIS SKETCH FROM PUNCH OF DOYLE AND HOLMES THAT I QUITE LIKE
COLLECTIONS SEARCH PORTRAIT LINKED SEARCH SAS SEXT ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE ROLE SIT ARNO


PERHAPS A PIPE EVEN IF HE DOESN'T SMOKE IT'S A HOLMES PROPERTY OR A DEERSTALKER HAT

I JUST CHECKED BETSY IF YOU SEARCH HOLMES AND WATSON MEN THERE ARE A FEW NICE THINGS CUFFLINKS TIE ACCESSORY POCKET WATCH
SHERLOCK HOLMES COLLECTED THINGS THAT WERE ESSENTIALLY MEMENTOS OF THE CASES HE WORKED ON KEY CLUES ARTIFACTS ETC IF YOUR BOSS KNOWS THIS ABOUT HOLMES THEN A MEMENTO OF A PARTICULARLY HAIRY JOB YOU WORKED ON OR THE LIKE MIGHT FIT THE BILL

FAILING THAT A NICE BINDING OF THE BOOK LIKE U AURORABLUE SUGGESTED IF HE'S A READER IF NOT A DVD SET OF SHERLOCK OR EVEN THE OLD BASIL RATHBONE MOVIES JUST NOT ELEMENTARY FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S GOOD
A SYRINGE
ROXANE GAY BAD FEMINIST

A NECESSARY REMINDER THAT FEMINISM IS ABOUT BEING YOURSELF THE WHOLE ACTUAL PERSON WHO HAS EQUAL RIGHTS AND VALUE TO EVERYONE ELSE AND NOT ABOUT GIVING UP RAP MUSIC AND THE COLOR PINK UNLESS YOU HATE RAP MUSIC AND THE COLOR PINK IN WHICH CASE YOU KNOW GO FORTH

THIS BOOK IS ABOUT SO MUCH MORE I REMEMBER FEELING WHEN SHE DESCRIBED HER SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THE AFTERMATH I WAS DELIGHTED BY HER ESSAY ABOUT SCRABBLE COMPETITIONS I NODDED ALONG WITH HER ABOUT THE HUNGER GAMES PARAPHRASING THAT SHE CANNOT BE A CRITIC OF THE MOVIES BECAUSE IT'S TOO CLOSE TO HERALDRY THAT SHE KNOWS THERE ARE FAULTS WITHIN IT BUT SHE CANNOT CRITIQUE IT BECAUSE IT WAS THAT ENGAGING ANOTHER ESSAY GAVE A NECESSARY CRITIQUE OF CAITLIN HOW TO BE A WOMAN
SOME REALLY INTERESTING BOOKS ON THIS LIST THE ONES I HAVEN'T READ I'M CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST SO MANY INTERESTING TOPICS AND VIEWPOINTS

THANKS FOR SHARING
WOMEN SHOULD WEAR STILETTOS AND NICE DRESSES END OF CONVERSATION
BILL CLINTON WAS PROBABLY THE MOST MISOGYNISTIC PRESIDENT I CAN REMEMBER BUT ALL THIS FEAR ONLY COMES UP WHEN A REPUBLICAN IS ELECTED
DELETED
MUCH MORE DEEPER HUH
MORE DEEP OR PREFERABLY JUST DEEPER
I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT HOW THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES AND TREATS THAT CRUELTY OR SUFFERING A HUMANE AUTHOR WOULD TREAT IT WITH RESPECT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DIGNITY FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED YOU CAN DISMISS SOMEONE AS A WHINY PAGE O SOUTH OR YOU CAN DELVE INTO THEIR PAST TRAUMAS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS YOU CAN CALL SOMEONE EVIL OR YOU CAN HUMANELY EXPLORE THEIR PSYCHOLOGY AND WHY THEY ACT THE WAY THEY DO
I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE BOOKS CONTAINING UNIMAGINABLE CRUELTY OFTEN DEAL WITH THE HARSHER REALITIES OF WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE HUMAN THIS QUEST FOR UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT IS DEEMED HUMANE EVEN THOUGH THE CRUELTY IS ALMOST SICKENING FOR ME THE MAN BOOKER WINNER IN THE NARROW ROAD TO THE DEEP NORTH BY RICHARD FLANAGAN IS A CASE IN POINT IT'S ALMOST BECOMING A NEW DEFINITION OF HUMANE THIS BOOK DEALS WITH REALLY HARSH SUBJECTS IN A SERIOUS WAY
I ALWAYS READ IT AS A DIFFERENT MEANING OF HUMANE LIKE THEY UNDERSTAND AND ATTEMPT TO REPRESENT AS BEST THEY CAN THE HUMAN PARTS OF THE STORIES
BECAUSE HUMANE IN THIS CONTEXT REFERS TO TREATING AN ISSUE IN A GENUINE PALPABLE WAY THAT RELATES TO HOW HUMAN INDIVIDUALS PERCEIVE SUFFERING OR BAD EXPERIENCES FROM AN AUTHENTIC POINT OF VIEW

IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE WRITING PLEASANT FICTION
WHEN YOU RELATE THE WORD HUMANE WITH BEING GOOD IT IS A MISTAKE ACTUALLY BEING A HUMAN IS NOT THE SAME AS BEING GOOD BUT A PACK OF EMOTIONS AND DESIRES AND OPTIONS THAT WILL HANDLE SOME SITUATION IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WE KIND OF CREATED THE CONCEPT OF CRUELTY FOR OUR CURRENT LIVES SO IT IS HUMANE I DON'T KNOW IF A MONKEY THINKS HE IS CRUEL WHILE DOING SOME HARM TO OTHER MONKEY BUT THE HUMAN DOES SOMETIMES IF A BOOK CONTAINS TYPES OF FEELINGS DESIRES MORAL AND AMORAL STATEMENTS SO CAN BE DESCRIBED AS HUMANE IN A WAY BECAUSE OUR LIVES ARE ALL ABOUT THESE THINGS
I'VE ALWAYS TAKEN IT AS AN EMPATHETIC LOOK AT CRUELTY ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE WAY THE SUFFERING IN QUESTION IS DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK UNLESS IT'S MINDLESS KILLING IT COULD VERY WELL BE A HUMANE TYPE OF SUFFERING
THE GOD DELUSION BY RICHARD DAWKINS I READ IT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL MY MOM BOUGHT IT FOR ME AT THE BOOKSTORE QUICKLY ALLOWING GOD IN THE TITLE TO BLIND HER OF THE WORD DELUSION AND ANYTHING ELSE THE BOOK WOULD REPRESENT QUICKLY MADE ME A YOUNG ATHEIST
AND ANTHEM THEY TAUGHT ME HOW PRECIOUS INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY IS
YOU ARE A BADASS BY JEN SINCERE

HER RIDICULOUSLY RELATABLE USE OF FOUL LANGUAGE AND GENUINE HUMAN STRUGGLES CAUSED ME TO QUIT MY USELESS JOB FOUR HOURS AFTER FINISHING IT AND LED ME ON A JOURNEY TO BUILD MY CAREER WHICH IVE EARNED IN MONTHS
HMM CAN'T NAME JUST ONE BECAUSE I THINK A FEW HAVE CONSIDERABLY IN DIFFERENT WAYS

A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE SERIES WAS THE FIRST FANTASY SERIES I EVER READ IT SHOWED ME READING COULD BE AS FUN AS ANY OTHER MEDIUM AND WAS WHAT GOT ME BACK INTO READING AFTER HAVING PUT BOOKS DOWN FOR A FEW YEARS

THE ONE TWO PUNCH OF KAFKA ON THE SHORE FOLLOWED BY INFINITE JEST REALLY SMASHED ALL THE PRECONCEPTIONS I HAD ABOUT WHAT BOOKS WERE PLUS THEY GOT ME INTO A MORE EXPERIMENTAL FICTION WHICH I'M REALLY HAVING A BLAST EXPLORING

A PEOPLES HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES BY HOWARD ZINN WAS HUGELY INFLUENTIAL TO A YOUNG ME IT SHOWED ME NO PROGRESS EVER CAME WITHOUT A FIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY AND IF YOU'RE A TYPE OF PERSON TO HAVE CERTAIN BELIEVES IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CARRY THAT TRADITION ON

THE BOOK BY ALAN WATTS REALLY IN THAT CLICHE WAY SAVED MY LIFE THOUGH I NO LONGER THINK ITS NEARLY AS SIMPLE AS TO SAY QUANTUM MECHANICS ZEN I STILL LOVE THE HEART OF THAT BOOK IT REALLY PULLED MY YOUNGER DEPRESSED HEAD OUT OF MY ASS WHEN I MOST NEEDED IT
ON THE ROAD
THE ALCHEMIST BY PAULO COELHO I LOVE THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT HELPED ME TO ENVISION MY OWN LIFE JOURNEY IN THE SAME MANNER
THE NERVE-RENDING STORY BY MICHAEL ENDE A BEAUTIFUL INVENTIVE STORY THAT MADE ME THINK ABOUT ESCAPISM AND FANTASY STORIES AND GENERALLY ABOUT BEING A READER
COLLAPSE BY JARED DIAMOND IT MADE ME UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT ENVIROMENT QUALITY HEALY IS
SHOWED ME THE VALUE OF THE SELF
THE LORD OF THE RINGS DREW ME INTO THE HIGH FANTASY GENRE MY FAVORITE GENRE WITHOUT A DOUBT
THE MASQUE OF RED DEATH BY EDGAR ALLEN POE MADE ME REALISE HOW MUCH I LOVE HORROR FICTION
THREE BY HERMANN HESSE SIDDHARTHA NARCISSUS AND GOLDMUND AND STEPPENWOLF

THEY SHOWED ME I WAS NOT ALONE IN MY EXISTENTIAL DUALISTIC SPIRITUAL CONFUSION SIDDHARTHA WAS ALSO THE BOOK ME AND MY BONDED OVER ON OUR FIRST DATE WHICH WAS ACTUALLY JUST SITTING BY A STREAM AT NIGHT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE BROKEN UP THOSE WERE WONDERFUL YEARS
GAME BOTH BECAUSE THE STORY IS SO INCREDIBLE AND BECAUSE OF THE FUCKING ABSURD DISSONANCE BETWEEN THE ACCEPTANCE AND MESSAGE REGARDING XENOPHOBIA IN THE NOVEL AND THE ABSOLUTE OF ENDER SCOTT CARD IN REAL LIFE IS COMPLETELY MILD-BLOWING THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PART OF THE STORY IS I THINK THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CREATED THROUGH THEIR COMPUTERS DONT RECALL THE NAME

ALSO ANYTHING MARGARET ATWOOD BEAUTIFUL NOVELS
MADONNA IN A FUR COAT
INTO THE WILD EIGER DREAMS BY JON KRAKAUER LOVED THE BOOK INSPIRED ME TO TRAVEL ON THE RUGGED INSTEAD OF HIDING IN RESORTS FANCY HOTELS
THE HARRY POTTER SERIES FAHRENHEIT AND NOT ALL MY FAVORITE BUT DEFINITELY ALTERED ME MOST
BY GEORGE ORWELL
ULYSSES BY JAMES JOYCE IT MADE ME WANT TO WRITE WHEN I LEARNED HOW MUCH A BOOK COULD MAKE ME FEEL I'VE NEVER FELT MORE EMOTIONS IN REAL LIFE THAN I HAVE IN READING THAT BOOK

IT FORCED ME TO EXPAND MY VOCABULARY AND MADE ME REVISIT LOTS OF BOOKS THAT I HAD PASSIVELY READ IN EARLIER TIMES

HAMLET IS NOW MY SECOND FAVOURITE PIECE OF FICTION AFTER ULYSSES

I PICKED A DIFFERENT AUTHOR AS MY INSPIRATION FOR WRITING BECAUSE TO ME JOYCE IS THE APEX OF WHAT THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE CAN DO
I DONT KNOW IF ANYTHING REALLY CHANGED MY LIFE BUT THE EGYPTIAN BY MIKA WALTARI IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW NOVELS I HAVE READ LISTENED MULTIPLE TIMES AND IT ALWAYS GIVES ME SOME DIFFERENT ASPECT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT AVAILABLE AS UNABRIDGED VERSION IN ENGLISH AS FAR AS I KNOW
CHANGE YOUR YOUR LIFE BY DR WAYNE DYER
THE SON BY PHILLIP MEYER GREATEST FICTION AMERICAN CLASSIC NOVEL I HAVE EVER READ TO THIS DAY COULDN'T STOP READING ONCE I LIFTED THE BOOK UP MADE ME REALIZE HOW IMMENSE BEAUTIFUL AND EXHAUSTING THE WORLD REALLY IS
THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS CHANGED MY PERCEPTIONS OF GENDER AND SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS ABOUT INDIVIDUALS

SMALL GODS MADE ME THINK ABOUT BELIEF AND

MAGIC OF REALITY HELPED WITH UNDERSTANDING THE DEEP ROOTS BEHIND THINGS PEOPLE BELIEVE
WILLOW BY JULIA HOBAN REALLY HELPED ME WHEN I WAS YOUNGER THAT AND ANYTHING BY COURTNEY SUMMERS
INFINITE JEST BY DAVID FOSTER WALLACE IT SORT OF BROKE MY FEELINGS AND I THINK I BECAME A WORSE PERSON AFTER READING IT
CELESTINE PROPHECY
HOW TO READ A BOOK BY MORTIMER ADLER
THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV
GAVE ME A NEW VIEW ON SOCIETY AND LEARNED ME TO VIEW IT ON A MACRO AND MICRO PERSPECTIVE

THE TRAIL

THE NEW YORK TRILOGY CONVINCED ME THAT WEIRD IS FUN

INFINITE JEST IS CURRENTLY SHOWING ME THAT WELL WRITTEN WORDS AND INTERESTING SUBJECT MATTER CAN LEAD ME THROUGH INCOMPREHENSIVE STORYLINES
HAD A BUMPY CHILDHOOD AND HARRY POTTER GOT ME THROUGH MANY A ROUGH YEAR THAT SERIES WILL FOREVER HOLD A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART

AS AN ADULT AMERICAN GODS BY NEIL CAIMAN I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT IT MADE ME LOOK AT THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY
LIVING THE BEST DAY EVER BY HENDRIK COETZEE

GOT ME INTO THINKING ABOUT LIFE SPIRITUALITY EXPLORATION DEATH AND JUST OVERALL THE POWER OF OUTDOOR ACTIVATES AND ADVENTURE

HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO OUTDOOR ENTHUSIASTS OF ANY KIND BUT ESPECIALLY KAYAKERS RAFTERS AND EXPLORERS
I ENJOYED IT IT RAISES A LOT OF ETHICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS AROUND THE CHARACTERS POINTS OF VIEW GUIDE THE ARGUMENTS AS CIRCUMSTANCES UNFOLD AND THE INEVITABLE HAPPENS
I'M JUST FINISHING IT FOR THE THIRD TIME IN FACT LAST NIGHT I STUCK THE BOOKMARK IN RIGHT AFTER NADIA FOUND REMAINS

I AGREE THAT THE CHARACTERS DESIRE FOR A DIFFERENT SOCIETAL STRUCTURE IS COMPELLING ROBINSON DOES AN AMAZING JOB OF CREATING A BELIEVABLE MARS WITH THE CONFLICTING INTERESTS OF THE ANARCHIST ELEMENTS IN THE FIRST HUNDRED AND THE CORPORATIST IT'S AN AMAZING STORY THAT HAS NEVER GOTTEN ENOUGH ATTENTION
ANYONE WHO'S READ THE WHOLE SERIES WOULD YOU RECOMMEND IT
INCREDIBLE BOOK I JUST FINISHED THIS LAST NIGHT I'M INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN THE HIDDEN COLONY AND TRANSACTS IN THE FUTURE LOOKING FORWARD TO FINISHING THE TRILOGY
IT STRUCK ME AS A BIT OF AN ANALOGY FOR EARTH AT PRESENT AND A FAIRLY UNSUBTLE HINT THAT IF YOU PUSH TOO FAR AWAY FROM WHAT POWER WANTS THEN POWER WILL CRUSH YOU IF IT CAN'T USE YOU EXCELLENT BOOK WITH RICH CHARACTERS AND BELIEVABLE SCENARIOS AND SCIENCE LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THE REST OF THE TRILOGY
THE GREAT THING IS THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT'S GOING ON WITH TECHNOLOGY NOT THAT FANCY TECH DOESN'T PLAY A HUGE ROLL BUT IT TAKES A REAL BACK SEAT TO THE QUESTION OF WHO GETS TO CONTROL A MARTIAN FUTURE AND THE ETHICS OF COLONIZATION IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE SERIES BTW MAYA IS A TOTAL BRAT
THEY'VE AUTOMATED THE STARVING ARTIST
THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL
THESE SHOULD BE IN EVERY BATHROOM STALL
PULP FICTION IS DUE FOR A COMEBACK
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT THING TO HAVE OR YRS AGO BEFORE SMARTPHONES NOW IT JUST LOOKS WASTEFUL


EDIT I'M SURPRISED THE TOP COMMENT ISN'T THE LINK FOR A APP THAT DOES THE SAME THING BUT EVEN BETTER THIS IS WE DON'T NEED TO WASTE SO MUCH PAPER METAL ENERGY YOU CAN GET A USED SMARTPHONE WITH A LARGE LCD AND A DECENT CPU TO READ BOOKS ON EBAY CORALIST KIJIJI FOR LESS THAN OR BRAND NEW ON ALIEXPRESS FOR LESS THAN
I LIKE THE FORMAT OF THIS AND THAT IT'S FREE HOWEVER THE WHOLE SHORT STORY BOOK FROM VENDING MACHINES FOR PAY OBVIOUSLY THIS IS GRATIS THING CONFUSES ME THE WHOLE POINT OF A BOOK STORE IS TRY BEFORE YOU BUY AND NOW IT'S ALMOST BECOMING EXPECTED TO BUY BEFORE YOU TRY

THAT SAID STILL COOL
SO THE SAME THING AS ZINES
INTERESTING I WONDER HOW THEY VET THE STORIES
HOW WOULD ONE SUBMIT A STORY TO BE CHOSEN BY THESE MACHINES
THESE SHOULD BE DELIVERING R WRITINGPROMPTS
HOPE THOSE AREN'T PRINTED ON BPA COATED THERMAL PAPER
BUT WHAT IF I CAN'T READ CAN I GET A MACHINE THAT DISPENSES READERS


SOUNDS LIKE SOME SHITTY READING
OR JUST OWN A SMARTPHONE
WHAT A WASTE
VERY COOL ANYTHING THAT ENCOURAGES READING IS A WIN I LIKE THE RANDOMNESS COMPONENT
R MADEMESMILE
I SAW ONE OF THESE IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY PRINT OUT THE STORIES ON REALLY SATISFYING RECEIPT PAPER AND THE STORY THAT I GOT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
DO THEY DISH THEM OUT ONLY IN FRENCH IS ENGLISH NOT AN OPTION
ONE OF THE STORIES MUST BE WRITTEN BY KILGORE TROUT
COOL IDEA
OR YOU COULD BROWSE REDDIN SHORT STORIES
CAN WE SET THESE UP TO ONLY PRINT NOVELS THAT HAVE WON THE BAD SEX IN FICTION AWARD
I WANT ONE FOR MY COMPANY'S WAITING ROOM
SELECTED BY THE COMMUNITY YOU SAY
THEN ONE OF THOSE STORES IS SURELY NAMED STORY MCSTORYFACE
NEW YORKERS WOULD SEE THIS AS A FREE TOILET PAPER DISPENSER
PENGUIN DID A SELECTION OF CLASSICS LAST YEAR ALL LITTLE BLACK BOOKS CONTAINING A CLASSIC SHORT STORY OR EXTRACT OF A LARGER BOOK THEY WOULD BE BRILLIANT TO HAVE IN A DISPENSER INSERT AND RECEIVE A SMALL BOOK AT RANDOM IT WOULD GET PEOPLE READING TALKING ABOUT THE BOOKS AND MAYBE EVEN CREATE A SMALL SWAPPING COMMUNITY

OBVIOUSLY I MEAN DISPENSING THE BOOKS NOT PRINTING THEM LIKE THIS DOES
HACK THAT SHIT NOOOOOOW
WHAT A FUCKING DUMB DEVICE
GIVE ME ONE IN GEORGIA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
THEY HAVE ONE OF THESE AT CAFE ZOETROPE IN SAN FRANCISCO NICE ITALIAN RESTAURANT OWNED BY FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA IT'S NICE WHEN YOU'RE WAITING TO GET A TABLE
WASTE OF PAPER JUST GO TO R WRITINGPROMPTS FOR ALL THAT SHORT STORY GOODNESS BUT WITHOUT THE PESKY SELECTION COMMITTEE
WAIT WHY ARE THEY ON STREETS

THEY SHOULD BE IN CHITTERS EVERYWHERE
DO THE WRITERS GET A ROYALTY
R DOGSLEEP SHOULD SUBMIT THEIR TOP OF THE MONTH STORIES
THEY NEED TO LOAD R SHOWERTHOUGHTS TO THIS THING
HERE IN THE USA SOME IDIOT WOULD GET LEGISLATION PASSED BANNING THESE BECAUSE SOMEBODY WOULD CLAIM ONE OF THE STORIES HAD SECRET COMMUNIST OR NAZI PROPAGANDA

THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS AMERICA
NO PHONES IN FRANCE
SEEMS PRETTY WASTEFUL
R TITLEGORE
WE NEED MORE THINGS LIKE THIS
I CAN SEE IT NOW STREETS LITTERED WITH SHORT STORIES AND CLIMATE CHANGE ACCELERATING DUE TO THE POLLUTION CAUSED BY THE EVIL LITERATE DAMN LITERATES
DELETED
NEAT BUT A LITTLE STRANGE TO USE A PAPER FORMAT INSTEAD OF ELECTRONIC DOWNLOADS WHAT IS NEXT A BUGGY WHIP DISPENSER KIOSK
IT'S INTERESTING THAT THIS IS FROM THE BLADE A TOLEDO OH BASED PAPER FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT KNOW AS I'M AN INSTRUCTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO I ALWAYS TRY TO GET HARD COPIES INTO MY CLASSROOM EVEN IF THAT MEANS HAND WRITING JOURNALS WHICH I OFTEN DO

I DON'T BELIEVE THAT FOR A MOMENT THAT BOOKS ARE DEAD AND I THINK YOUR TITLE IS A BIT MISLEADING THIS ARTICLE IS MORE SO THAT BOOKS IN THE CAMPUS BOOKSTORE ARE LESS PREVALENT PLUS YOU DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION PARTNERSHIPS THAT BRING LITERAL BOOKSTORES ON CAMPUS LIKE THE ONE BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO AND BARNES NOBLE I THINK YOU'VE FALLEN INTO A BIT OF SELECTIVE EVIDENCE THIS ARTICLE HAS ALSO FAILED TO BEING ATTENTION TO THE ARTICLES USED IN CLASS PEER REVIEW BETWEEN STUDENTS AND THE GROUP WORK DONE AMONGST THEM YES THERE HAS BEEN A BOOM IN DIGITAL TEXTBOOKS BUT THE PEN AND PAPER WILL NEVER TRULY BE REPLACED HELL I'VE STILL GOT STUDENTS TRYING TO HAND WRITE ESSAYS AND TURN THEM IN
WELL NOW I HAVE TO GO TO BED ANGRY THANKS
DESPITE THE HEADLINE THE ARTICLE SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT STUDENTS ARE STILL BUYING BOOKS THEY'RE JUST ORDERING THEM TO BE DELIVERED BY MAIL RATHER THAN BUYING THE BOOKS AT THE CAMPUS STORE THAT SEEMS REASONABLE TO ME I GET A LOT OF MY BOOKS THAT WAY TOO
I HAVE NEVER READ OR HEARD ABOUT THIS BOOK BUT I AM NOW INTERESTED CAN YOU PLEASE ELABORATE ON HOW THE BOOK CHANGED YOUR READING LIFE
I'M NOT SURE WHAT CONSTITUTES A RESPECTABLE BOOK LIST BUT IT'S VERY COMMONLY MENTIONED IN SELF-HELP AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT ARTICLES I AGREE THOUGH WOULD RECOMMEND IT'S BASICALLY THE BOOK TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS OF READING AND HOW YOU CAN GET MORE OUT OF IT
BECAUSE IT PRESCRIBES A VERY INEFFICIENT AND INFLEXIBLE METHOD
I COMPLETELY AGREE THIS BOOK SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING IN HIGH SCHOOL

I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD THOUGH THAT THIS BOOK IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU GET A NOVEL IT ISN'T GOING TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHY SOME NOVELS ARE CONSIDERED GREAT AND OTHERS ARE NOT I MENTION THIS ONLY BECAUSE THE SUB IS ALMOST ENTIRELY DOMINATED BY THE DISCUSSION OF NOVELS AND WHILE THIS BOOK ADDRESSES FICTION IT IS ALMOST ENTIRELY DOMINATED BY THE DISCUSSION OF NONFICTION IT IS MORE ABOUT ANALYZING TERMS STATEMENTS AND ARGUMENTS
I JUST HAD A QUICK BROWSE THROUGH IT AND IT DOESN'T SEEM VERY USEFUL TO ME SURELY IT'S THE SORT OF ATTITUDE THAT NATURALLY DEVELOPS AS ONE GAINS MORE EXPOSURE TO THE WORLD ESPECIALLY WHEN A CHILD BEGINS TO APPROACH AND WHEN ONE BEGINS TO COME ACROSS OPPOSING OR AT LEAST INCONSISTENT OPINIONS PEOPLE WHO CARE ENOUGH TO WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY READ WOULD BE READING ENOUGH TO FIGURE THIS OUT NATURALLY
ADLER WAS A FAMOUS IN THE PARLANCE OF OUR TIME AND NOT FRIENDLY TO THE OF THIS TIME THE CHICAGO SCHOOL WERE WELL PRETTY CONSERVATIVE AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS GOOD FOR YOU FOR KEEPING HIS MEMORY ALIVE
I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT FEELS ME WHEN I EVEN MENTION THE NAME OF SAID BOOK MOST SCOFF IF THEY ONLY KNEW


EDIT I WILL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO PLUG THE GREAT CONVERSATION WHICH IS THE PRIMER TO THE GREAT BOOKS OF THE WESTERN WORLD WHICH IS HOW I WAS FAMILIARIZED WITH ADLER MYSELF HIS WORK HAS BEEN PARAMOUNT IN MY ADULT EDUCATION
DELETED
DELETED
THE ONLY REAL ANSWER IT'S UP TO YOU THERE ARE NO SHOULD
IT DEPENDS

FRENCH THREE OR FOUR WORDS A PAGE FOR ME ITALIAN THREE OR FOUR WORDS A LINE I DON'T READ FOR PLEASURE IN ITALIAN JUST TO IMPROVE MY NOVICE GRIP ON THE LANGUAGE
WHAT I DO PERSONALLY IS LOOK UP THE WORDS ONCE I'M DONE READING FOR THE MOMENT UNLESS THE WORD PREVENTS ME FROM UNDERSTANDING A SENTENCE COMPLETELY IN WHICH CASE I'LL LOOK IT UP IMMEDIATELY
I THINK IT'S SMART TO SPEND A GOOD PORTION OF YOUR READING TIME READING THINGS WHERE YOU CAN ENJOY THE FLOW OF THE STORY WITHOUT USING A DICTIONARY OR USING IT VERY LITTLE IF YOU REALLY NEED A DICTIONARY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE READING AND YOU DON'T USE ONE THAT'S JUST GOING TO GET FRUSTRATING BUT READING MATERIAL THAT'S EASY ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN MOSTLY UNDERSTAND IT AND JUST GUESS OR SKIP OVER THE FEW WORDS YOU DON'T KNOW IS REALLY HELPFUL IN GETTING USED TO THE GRAMMAR OF THE LANGUAGE IN A WAY THAT READING DIFFICULT MATERIAL AND LOOKING UP ALL THE UNFAMILIAR WORDS ISN'T BOTH ARE USEFUL OF COURSE BUT THEY'RE USEFUL IN DIFFERENT WAYS
LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID IT DEPENDS

I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU READ BOOKS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE THAT ARE AT THE SAME LANGUAGE LEVEL THAT YOU ARE AND NOT AT THE SAME READING LEVEL THAT YOU ARE IN YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE I GENERALLY DON'T LOOK UP MORE THAN A COUPLE WORDS PER CHAPTER BUT THAT IS ALSO BECAUSE I PREFER TO FIGURE OUT AN UNKNOWN WORD THROUGH CONTEXT

IF I'M REALLY READING FOR LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT THOUGH I USUALLY PICK A BOOK THAT I'VE ALREADY READ IN A LANGUAGE THAT I'M FLUENT IN SO THE STORY ITSELF TAKES A BACKSEAT BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW IT AND I CAN FOCUS ON THE LANGUAGE ITSELF
IT DEPENDS ON WHY YOU'RE READING THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO APPROACHES INTENSIVE READING AND EXTENSIVE READING THEY'RE EACH USEFUL IN THEIR OWN WAY

INTENSIVE READING IS BASICALLY STUDYING YOU'LL READ A SHORTER SECTION A FEW PAGES AT MOST AND LOOK UP ANYTHING YOU DON'T KNOW TO THE POINT THAT YOU CAN COMPLETELY TRANSLATE EVERYTHING ON THE PAGE IT'S A SLOW PROCESS IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO SPEND AN HOUR TRANSLATING A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE

EXTENSIVE READING IS MORE LIKE PLEASURE READING YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND OF THE WORDS AND HAVE A GOOD GRASP OF SENTENCE STRUCTURE AT THAT LEVEL YOU SHOULD GET THE GIST OF WHAT YOU'RE READING AND BE ABLE TO INFER SOME OF THE NEW WORDS FROM CONTEXT THOUGH YOU'LL PROBABLY READ AT A SLOWER PACE THAN YOU WOULD IN YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE HERE YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT PRECISELY TRANSLATING EVERYTHING JUST ENJOY THE PROCESS AND GET AS MUCH VOLUME AS YOU CAN
DEPEND EN LA FACILIDAD EN QUE SUEDE LEER
I WRITE DOWN ALL THE WORDS I DON'T KNOW BUT ONLY LOOK THEM UP IF THEY'RE STARTING TO CROP UP AGAIN AND AGAIN

THE WORDS I WRITE DOWN GO INTO AN EXCEL DOCUMENT WHICH HIGHLIGHTS DUPLICATES THEREBY ENSURING I LEARN THE MOST COMMON USEFUL WORDS FIRST
WHENEVER I DID THIS I LOOKED UP A LOT OF WORDS IN THE BEGINNING TO MAKE SURE I WASN'T MISSING ANYTHING BUT AFTER A WHILE I BECAME IMPATIENT AND SKIPPED LOOKING UP A LOT OF THE WORDS BECAUSE I STILL GOT THE GIST OF IT
THIS HAPPENS TO ME IF I NEVER FELT ENGAGED BY THE BOOK TO BEGIN WITH IF IT IS A HO HUM STORY AND I CAN PUT DOWN A BOOK FOR A FEW DAYS AND I'M NOT DYING TO KNOW HOW IT ENDS THEN I USUALLY DON'T RETURN THE ONLY TIME I FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS FOR BOOK GROUP

OCCASIONALLY I'LL READ SOMETHING AND SET IT ASIDE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I NEED TIME TO PROCESS IT IN THAT CASE WHEN I'M READY TO RETURN I CAN USUALLY GET BACK INTO IT WITHOUT PROBLEM
ONLY IF I LEAVE THE BOOK FOR TOO LONG I STARTED READING THE NAME OF THE WIND THIS SUMMER READ PAGES TRAVELING TO BARCELONA AND BACK BUT UNI STARTED AGAIN BEFORE I FINISHED IT AND I HAD TO PUT IT ASIDE AS SOON AS I HAD SOME FREE TIME I TRIED PICKING IT UP AGAIN BUT I CAN'T GET INTO IT
I'VE READ HOUSE OF LEAVES TWICE NOW AND EACH TIME I TOOK ABOUT A MONTH BREAK IN THE MIDDLE OF READING IVE NEVER HAD TOO MUCH TROUBLE PICKING UP A BOOK FROM WHERE I LEFT OFF BUT I GUESS I'M JUST ABLE TO ABSORB MYSELF INTO THE LITERATURE QUITE EASILY NOW PICKING UP AN RPG VIDEO GAME AFTER IT'S SAT FOR A YEAR THAT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT
IF I PUT A BOOK DOWN FOR A COUPLE DAYS WHEN I PICK IT UP I WILL USUALLY BACKTRACK A FEW PAGES OFTEN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT CHAPTER DEPENDING ON THE FORMAT OF THE BOOK HELPS ME RESET
I HAVE TO START OVER
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT LATELY I'VE BEEN CAREFUL TO GIVE MYSELF AT LEAST A LITTLE READING TIME EVERY DAY SO I DON'T HAVE TOO LONG A DROUGHT BETWEEN READING SESSIONS

SOMETIMES I WANDER FROM ONE BOOK TO ANOTHER USUALLY WHEN SOMETHING COMES IN AT THE LIBRARY AND DO SOMETIMES JUST HAVE TO START OVER OR AT LEAST DROP BACK A GOOD BIT TO GET MYSELF CAUGHT UP AGAIN
IT DEPENDS ON MY MOOD SOMETIMES I'LL BE IN A MOOD TO READ A THRILLER AND EVEN THOUGH THE BOOK WAS ENGAGING THE NEXT TIME I READ IT MAY NOT BE AS INTERESTING SINCE I'M NO LONGER REALLY UP FOR READING SOMETHING DARK AND GRITTY THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I HAVE SEVERAL BOOKS ACROSS DIFFERENT GENRES THAT ARE STILL UNFINISHED ITS NOT THE STORY PER SE BUT MY CURRENT READING PREFERENCE
ABSOLUTELY IT'S WHAT REALLY TURNED ME OFF OF IN WORKING ADULTHOOD UNTIL I STARTED READING LIT LIKE POETRY OR SHORT STORIES

I DON'T THINK I'VE READ THROUGH A FULL NOVEL SINCE HIGH SCHOOL THERE'S JUST NO TIME TO GET ABSORBED LIKE THAT
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OLDER FOLKS IN THE THREAD HE MEANS AFTER PUTTING A BOOK ASIDE FOR A WHILE
YEP I'VE LEFT MOBY DICK ANNA KARENINA AND THE GRAPES OF WRATH BECAUSE OF THIS EXACT REASON GRANTED I FOUND ALL THREE DULL AS DISHWATER SOME MORE SO THAN OTHERS BUT STILL IT'S BEEN MONTHS SINCE I LAST READ ANOTHER PAGE OUT OF ANY OF THEM
WITH SOME BOOKS ITS NO PROBLEM BUT SOMETHING LIKE WAR AND PEACE WITH ITS DOZENS OF CHARACTERS I WOULDN T HAVE DARED TO PUT THAT BOOK ASIDE FOR LONG BECAUSE AFTER 2 WEEKS I WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN SOME CHARACTERS AND DETAILS OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED PARTIALLY
YEAH THE LAST BOOK I PAUSED IS NOW A MONITOR STAND
YEAH LATELY I READ ALL FOUR BOOKS BY SARAH J MAAS THRONE OF GLASS SERIES AND NOW THE FIFTH BOOK CAME OUT LAST MONTH AND I HAVE A REAAAALLY HARD TIME MOVING ON I'VE READ MAYBE PAGES WITHIN A MONTH BUT I READ ALL THE PREVIOUS BOOKS WITHIN TWO WEEKS IT GETS ON MY NERVES REALLY I JUST WANT TO FINISH IT BUT I CAN'T GET MYSELF TOGETHER IT SEEMS KIND OF FAR STRETCHED TO ME NOW
IS THIS JUST A THREAD TO TELL US YOU READ FAST

CONGRATS
DELETED
NICE BRAG
SLOW READER HERE SOMETIMES I'D LIKE TO BE A BUT I ACTUALLY DON'T MIND BEING A SLOW READER MOST OF THE TIME IF I TRY TO THROUGH A BOOK I LOSE HALF THE PLOT AND END UP LOST THEN SLOWLY WHAT I JUST FINISHED I GUESS AS LONG AS YOU GET THE PLOT IT'S GOOD
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS HOW FAST YOU READ AS LONG AS A YOU LIKE IT AND B YOU REMEMBER IT IF YOU'RE TEARING THROUGH SO FAST THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY RECALL WHAT YOU READ I'D SAY IT'S TOO FAST BUT OTHERWISE IT SHOULDN'T REALLY MATTER IF IT'S FAST OR SLOW PEOPLE SET THEIR PACE PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATICALLY AND THAT'S A-OK

I PERSONALLY DO READ TOO FAST DURING ACTION SCENES OR ANY TIME I'M ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY EXCITED BY THE BOOK BUT I KNOW IT'S HAPPENING AND I LIKE IT YOU JUST NEED TO STUFF THAT INFORMATION IN YOUR BRAIN AS FAST AS POSSIBLE SOMETIMES
I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT THIS POST IS ABOUT TOO FAST FOR WHAT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE READING TO ENJOY WHAT YOU'RE READING

THEN IN THE SAME BREATH YOU SAY THAT YOU CAN'T SLOW YOUR READING SPEED DOWN SO WHAT'S THE POINT IN WORRYING ABOUT IT READING ISN'T A CONTEST IT IS SIMPLY BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR BOOK
I AM ALSO AN EXTREMELY FAST READER WITH SIMILAR READING SPEEDS TO OP I CAN EASILY READ ONE OR TWO MEDIUM LENGTH NOVELS IN A DAY KINDLES FTW MY DAUGHTER IS EXACTLY THE SAME WE ARE BOTH AID AND THERE MAY WELL BE A LINK THERE HYPERLEXIS

IF THAT'S HOW FAST YOU READ THAT'S HOW FAST YOU READ A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL ASSUME YOU'RE ONLY SKIMMING THOUGH I HAVE TRIED TO WORK OUT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT ALLOWS ME TO READ SO FAST AND MY BEST GUESS IS THAT I'M SOMEHOW ABLE TO CAPTURE A WHOLE LINE AT ONE GLANCE AND PROCESS IT EXTREMELY QUICKLY I BASICALLY READ STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE
I READ QUICKLY AS WELL AND NORMALLY I THINK THAT'S FINE THERE ARE SOME BOOKS THOUGH THAT I MAKE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO SLOW DOWN AND ENJOY EVEN IF THAT MEANS I TAKE HUGE BREAKS BETWEEN CHAPTERS TO READ OTHER THINGS THE COSMICOMICS FALLS UNDER THIS
ISN'T IT IMPORTANT TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN READING I CAN'T IMAGINE BURNING THROUGH SWANS WAY OR MELVILLE AT AND GETTING THE SAME THING AS IF YOU WERE TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE READING
I DON'T THINK IT REALLY MATTERS HOW FAST YOU READ AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABSORBING THE INFORMATION LAST TIME I READ THE HARRY POTTER SERIES IT TOOK ME TWO DAYS IT TOOK MY SISTER A FEW MONTHS WE BOTH ENJOYED IT JUST THE SAME IT IS NICE THAT I WAS ABLE TO MOVE ONTO ANOTHER SERIES SOONER RATHER THAN LATER BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT HASN'T REALLY AFFECTED MY LIFE MUCH
IF THAT'S WHAT WORKS FOR YOU GO FOR IT QUESTION THOUGH WHAT CONSTITUTES A DAY READING A PAGE NOVEL IN HOURS WOULD BE ABOUT AVERAGE BUT IF YOU'RE KNOCKING A BOOK OUT EVERY NIGHT AFTER WORK THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE
SO LONG AS YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU READING YOU CAN GO AT YOUR OWN PACE
IF I READ TOO FAST I ALWAYS MISS STUFF
I READ FAST TOO PEOPLE HAVE NEVER BEEN ANYTHING BUT MEAN TO ME WHEN I TALK ABOUT IT OTHER READERS ARE WORSE THAN TO BE HONEST THEY THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO BRAG WHEN YOU HAVE REAL QUESTIONS

WHEN I WANT TO SLOW DOWN I USE A BOOKMARK TO TRACK ONE LINE AT A TIME DOWN THE PAGE OR I READ ALOUD OR LISTEN TO AN AUDIOBOOK WHILE I READ OR USE A NOTEBOOK TO WRITE DOWN MY THOUGHTS AND REACTIONS WHILE I READ THOSE STRATEGIES WORK TO SLOW ME DOWN AND INCREASE MY COMPREHENSION WHEN THAT'S WHAT I WANT

REGARDING THE SOCIAL PROBLEM I'M LEARNING THAT IT'S WISE TO OBSCURE EXACTLY HOW FAST I'M READING SO OTHERS WON'T HAVE OCCASION TO NOTICE IT KINDLES ARE GREAT FOR THAT BECAUSE NO ONE NOTICES THAT YOU'RE READING A DIFFERENT BOOK THAN YOU WERE READING YESTERDAY
I READ FAIRLY FAST USED TO READ A BOOK A DAY IN HIGH SCHOOL NO PROBLEM FINISHED IT AND THE STAND IN THE SAME WEEKEND ETC

I NEVER TRIED SLOWING DOWN BUT I HAVE RESISTED SPEEDING UP I AM AFRAID IF I WERE TO LEARN SPEED READING TECHNIQUES IT WOULD CHANGE HOW I ENJOY BOOKS AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
I CAN READ SOMETHING EASY LIKE A LOUIS NOVEL IN MINS I READ OF THE GIRL WITH A DRAGOON TATOO ON A HOUR FLIGHT BETWEEN CORONA CA AND OAKLAND CA MUCH TO THE DISGUST OF THE TWO COWORKERS I WAS SEATED BETWEEN ON THE PLANE I ANSWERED ALMOST ALL THEIR QUESTION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHARACTER FIRST NAMES I NEVER RECOLLECT THOSE FOR SOME OBSCURE REASON BUT I AM FULLY AWARE OF THE PLOT LINE FROM BEGINNING TO END

TECHNICAL MATERIAL IS COMPLETELY OPPOSITE OF COURSE THERE I USUALLY READ ONE SENTENCE AT A TIME OR MAYBE JUST A SINGLE PARAGRAPH

I GENERALLY CAN'T STAND AUDIO BOOKS BECAUSE I CAN READ THEM MUCH FASTER THAN I CAN LISTEN TO THEM

IT ALL STARTED IN 5TH GRADE WHEN I HAD TO STAY HOME WITH A PINK EYE INFECTION AND THE TEACHER GAVE ME A READING COMPREHENSION COURSE TO WORK THROUGH WHILE I WAS AT HOME I COMPLETED IT IN DAYS AND HAVE READ PHENOMENALLY FAST EVER SINCE TEACH YOUR KIDS
COME SONNY BOY

I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH INTERNET FOR TODAY
A COUPLE WEREN'T TOO BAD BUT SOME OF EM WERE EVEN SO AWKWARD AS TO BE FUNNY
IS ONLY AN ISSUE IF YOU CAN'T FOCUS ON YOUR READING ALSO IF YOU READ ON AN STYLE READER THERE IS NO INTERNET TO GO SURFING ON BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS AND I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU IGNORE THE FACT THAT A PERSON CAN SET DOWN A PAPER BOOK AND START SURFING THE WEB JUST AS EASILY

2 ANY BOOK THAT IS INTERESTING WILL LEAD YOU TO DO MORE RESEARCH AND IF THE BOOK ITSELF SATISFIES YOUR QUESTIONS THEN WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF THE LINKS AND SUCH ARE THERE IF YOU DON'T NEED MORE INFO WHY WOULD YOU GET ALL DISTRACTED AND LOOK FOR MORE AGAIN READERS DON'T INCLUDE WEBSURFING

PAPER BOOKS LOOK NICE ON THE SHELF IF YOU HAVE THE SPACE BUT I READ EVERYWHERE NOT JUST AT HOME AND I HATE READING BIG HARDCOVER BOOKS THAT ARE HEAVY AND AWKWARD AND TOO BIG TO CARRY IN MY PURSE ARE INCREDIBLY CONVENIENT

I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT WITH THIS ONE THEY BOTH COST ABOUT THE SAME IF YOU BUY THEM NEW USED PAPER BOOKS ARE VERY MUCH CHEAPER IN GENERAL ALSO PAPER BOOKS CAN BE LENT TO FRIENDS OR GIVEN AWAY SOMETHING NOT REALLY POSSIBLE WITH DIGITAL BOOKS OR IS A HASSLE

I DON'T SEE WHY THERE HAS TO BE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THIS PAPER OR DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AS LONG AS YOU'RE READING AND ENJOYING IT I PREFER BOOKS BUT I DON'T INSULT PAPER BOOK READERS OR CONVINCE THEM TO CHANGE NEITHER ONE SEEMS TO BE REPLACING THE OTHER THEY AREN'T IN SOME KIND OF WAR FOR OUR DOLLARS FOR NOW

AND TOO MANY OF YOUR ARGUMENTS SEEM BASED ON TYPE READING IGNORING THE FACT THAT HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE READ MOSTLY NOVELS SO ALL THIS ABOUT STAYING ON TOPIC AND LINKS AND OUT-OF-DATE FACTS DOESN'T APPLY BUT SOME DOES WORK BETTER IN PAPER GRAPHS AND PHOTOS AND DIAGRAMS AND SO ON ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO READ ON A LOT OF BOOK SCREENS

READ WHATEVER YOU WANT IN THE WAY YOU WANT IN THE FORM THAT WORKS BEST FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT AND LEARNING MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME
I MUST DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT PORTABILITY AND STORAGE EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE SPACE BOOKS DO REQUIRE SOME MAINTENANCE RESHELVING AFTER READING DUSTING AND THE AVERAGE AUSTRALIAN OR NORTH AMERICAN FAMILY MOVES EVERY FIVE YEARS

I ALSO DON'T AGREE THAT PEOPLE MOSTLY READ AT HOME MANY PEOPLE READ ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT OR DURING THEIR LUNCH BREAKS HAVE A CLEAR ADVANTAGE IN THOSE SITUATIONS EVEN AT HOME MANY PREFER THE SMALL SIZE AND BUILT-IN LIGHT OF A KINDLE WHEN READING IN BED

THE ONLY AREA WHERE I THINK PAPER BOOKS HAVE AN ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE IS FOR BOOKS WITH PICTURES OR DIAGRAMS IN MOST OTHER CASES IT'S A MATTER OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE
DELETED
I JUST DON'T LIKE FEELING LIKE I DON'T OWN THE BOOKS AND ALSO NOT BEING ABLE TO FLIP THROUGH THE BOOK AS EASILY AS PAPERBACK I STILL FEEL LIKE I'M UNDECIDED BETWEEN THE TWO BUT BOOKS HAVE MORE PROS THAN CONS FOR ME
I LIKE BOTH AND CAN FOCUS JUST FINE BUT I AM LIMITING MY PHYSICAL BOOKS MORE AND MORE TO MY FAVORITES BECAUSE SPACE IS LIMITED
I LOVE BOTH BUT HAVING FINALLY MOVED INTO I HAVE TO SAY THAT THEY ARE SO MUCH BETTER FOR ME ANYWAY I HAVE READING ADD SOMETIMES AND I AM OFTEN READING MULTIPLE BOOKS AT ONCE CARRYING BOOKS AROUND EVERYWHERE BUS COFFEE SHOP ETC WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE AND I SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE I TRIED TO DO IT SEVERAL TIMES BEING ABLE TO READ MY TABLET ON MY FRONT PORCH AT NIGHT WITHOUT HAVING TO TEAR UP A PAPERBACK WITH A IS AWESOME TOO AND WHEN MY CATS ROLL ALL OVER ME I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT STICKING A BOOKMARK OR FINGER IN MY SPOT BEFORE I LOOSE IT

THAT'S NOT TO SAY PAPER BOOKS DON'T HAVE THEIR CHARM HOWEVER I INHERITED MY DAD'S EXTENSIVE LIBRARY AND I HAVE BOOKS THAT ARE CLOSE TO YEARS OLD THERE IS NOTHING LIKE PICKING UP A BOOK THAT MY FATHER READ YEARS AGO AND SEEING THE HISTORY OF THE TIME PERIOD OR THE BEAUTY OF THE VINTAGE ILLUSTRATIONS ON THE COVERS FOR THIS REASON I STILL BUY CERTAIN BOOKS IN PAPER

THERE ARE PROS AND CONS TO BOTH AND I'D HATE TO SEE EITHER VANISH
MCCARTHY WITH HIS UNENDING PHILOSOPHIZING AND BLEAK BUT BREATHTAKING DEPICTIONS OF NATURE COULD MATCH MALLICK IN STYLE IF NOT CONTENTION
MCCARTHY CHEKHOV AND STEINBECK CAPTURES ALL THOSE SMALL IMPRESSIONISTIC MOMENTS IN SIMILAR FASHION AS MALICK I'D SAY
ANY BOOK BY ANNIE DILLARD BUT ESPECIALLY PILGRIM AT TINKER CREEK
THE CONFESSIONS OF MAX TIVOLI BY ANDREW SEAN GREER
THERE ARE A LOT OF MOMENTS IN VIRGINIA NOVELS ESPECIALLY IN THE WAVES IT'S REALLY EXPERIMENTAL BUT IT DOES A GREAT JOB OF CATCHING HIS VIVID BUT DREAMY STYLE
WILLIAM RAMBLING SENTENCES OFTEN MEANDER THROUGH MEMORIES LIKE CAMERA DOES
I'M NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO RECOMMEND HIM HERE AND REALLY DIDN'T THINK I WOULD BE BUT ABSOLUTELY CORMAC MCCARTHY

HIS BOOKS ARE TECHNICALLY WAY OVERWRITTEN AND SEEMINGLY NEEDLESSLY VERBOSE BUT IF YOU'RE A FAN OF MALICK I THINK YOU'LL SEE IMMEDIATELY THAT THAT'S THE POINT OF THEM THEY'RE NOT SO MUCH ABOUT RELATING A SERIES OF EVENTS AS THEY ARE ABOUT DROWNING YOU IN ATMOSPHERE AND PLACING YOU IN A WHOLE OTHER MIND STATE

ALL THE PRETTY HORSES MIGHT BE A GOOD ONE TO START WITH IF YOU WANT A SIMILARLY ROMANTIC FEEL TO A LOT OF WORK BUT

BLOOD MERIDIAN IS CONSIDERED HIS MASTERPIECE AND IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE HIS MOST ACCESSIBLE WORK AND IS ALMOST CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BLEAKEST MOST BRUTAL BOOKS I'VE EVER READ BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN ARTIST USING THEIR MEDIUM TO CREATE UNBELIEVABLE ATMOSPHERE AND TO MUSE ABOUT THE SHORTCOMINGS OF HUMAN NATURE YOU REALLY CAN'T DO BETTER
NOBODY READS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE COOLER IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE

THE FUTURE MERGING PRINT WITH DIGITAL BY SELLING BOOKS AS SINGLE SHEET SCROLLS THAT SCROLL DOWN AS YOUR EYES MOVE USING FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE THEY WILL HAVE FANCY COVERS BUT COST LESS THAN PRINT BY ONLY NEEDING ONE ACTUAL PAGE INSIDE AND CAN BE DISPLAYED AND LOOK NICE IN ONE'S HOME
WHAT COMES NEXT HOPEFULLY A MOMENT IN HISTORY IN WHICH PEOPLE STOP PUSHING THIS MEANINGLESS DIGITAL VS PRINTED BULLCRAP AND ACCEPT THAT THERE IS NO SUPERIOR WAY OF READING A BOOK
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT HARD TO SHARE DIGITAL BOOKS HERE READ THIS BOOK ON ONE OF MY MANY MANY KINDLE DEVICES OR HERE LOG INTO MY AMAZON KINDLE ACCOUNT WHATEVER
ONE OF THESE DAYS MAYBE PRETTY PLEASE THE PUBLISHERS WILL STOP TRYING TO CONTROL EVERYTHING AND FREE UP THE CONTENT SO WE AS READERS CAN DO WITH IT WHAT WE WANT EASILY QUOTE ANNOTATE ORGANIZE SHARE AND USE IN OUR LIVES AMONG OTHERS WE ALREADY DO THIS WITH PAPER BOOKS JUST NOT AS EASILY THE ACT OF READING THE RITUAL OF READING NEEDS TO EVOLVE WITH DIGITAL BOOKS THAT'S WHAT IS NEXT BEFORE THE BRAIN IMPLANTS THIS DOESN'T MEAN WE LOSE THE TACTILE LOVE OF BOOKS WE OWN THE HEFT THE SPINE THE SMELL OF INK ON PAPER YOUR PLACE UNDERLINING PASSAGES WRITING IN MARGINS OR SIMPLY PLACING ON A SHELF TO LOOK AT AND PULL DOWN OCCASIONALLY TO THUMB THROUGH THE TWO WILL COEXIST IF THE DAMN PUBLISHERS WAKE UP
I HAVE THIS WEIRD THING WHERE I CARE ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THE BOOK FAR FAR MORE THAN THE EXPERIENCE OF READING IT I CAN CARRY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BOOKS MORE THAN I COULD EVER CONCEIVABLY READ ON MY PHONE A DEVICE I CARRY EVERYWHERE I MIGHT PUSH A BUTTON INSTEAD OF FLIP A PAGE BUT IDGAH BECAUSE THE STORY IS STILL GOOD THE METHOD OF DELIVERY IS FUCKING IRRELEVANT IT'S STILL TEXT AND IMAGES
IMO THIS ARTICLE IS THE WORST KIND OF ROMANTIC CLAPTRAP NOTHING BUT NOSTALGIA AND RARE BOOK SNOBBERY WHO CARES IF YOU HAVE A FANCY BOOK ON ROME GET OVER YOURSELF YA DAMNED BIBLOPHILLIAC I'M GRUMPY TODAY
PAPER BOOKS WHAT A CHUMP

CLAY TABLET MASTERRACE SUPPORT SCRIBES AND CLAY BAKERS
THE BIGGEST NEGATIVE AGAINST DIGITAL BOOKS IS THE SNOOTY BOOK READERS AND LIBRARY PURISTS THAT THINK LIBRARIES SHOULD REMAIN BOOK REPOSITORIES

WHAT COMES NEXT IS THE SNOOTY PEOPLE DIE OFF AND LIBRARIES THAT CATER TO SHAREABLE LOVELY AND ENDURING BOOKS GET SHUT DOWN BECAUSE NO ONE USES THEM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T ADAPT
WHY DOES THERE NEED TO BE A FUTURE FOR BOOKS BOOKS ARE BOOKS DIGITAL OFFER CONVENIENT STORAGE AND PORTABILITY PHYSICAL ONES OFFER TRADING ADVANTAGES AND PAPER FEEL PERIOD

WHY IS EVERYONE ALWAYS HUNG UP ABOUT EVOLUTION OF A MEDIA VEHICLE LET THEM JUST BE YOU KNOW EACH ONE CAN PICK WHAT THEY LIKE AND EVEN BOTH AND STOP LOOKING DEEPER INTO STAGNATION OR ENVIRONMENTS JEEZ
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD LET CONVENIENCE BE THE ONLY DECIDING FACTOR TO THE PEOPLE HERE TO CLAIM TO MOVE AROUND A LOT AND CANNOT SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY ON TRANSPORTING BOOKS IT MAKES SENSE FOR YOU GUYS TO USE A KINDLE OR SOME SUCH DEVICE

BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT PRINT BOOKS ARE TO ME MUCH MORE PERSONAL AND SUPERIOR I'VE TRIED READING BUT IT SIMPLY DIDN'T WORK OUT I MISSED THE ACTION OF ACTUALLY TURNING THE PAGE TAKING A LOOK AT THE COVER PUTTING IN MY FAVOURITE BOOKMARK AND CLOSING IT TO BE READ LATER I LOVE SITTING ON MY BED CROSS-LEGGED DIGGING IN TO THE LATEST BOOK BY A GREAT AUTHOR

WITH THIS EXPERIENCE IS DECIDEDLY DIFFERENT I'M A VERY OBJECTIVE PERSON WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT AND ARE GENUINELY MORE DISTANT AND COLD
PRO E BOOKS CAN READ ON PHONE CAN CARRY AROUND MILLIONS OF THEM W NO WEIGHT
CON LOVE PAGES CAN'T MARK UP HARD TO READ ONE HANDED
DIGITAL BOOKS STAGNATE IN CLOSED DULL SYSTEMS

EVERYTHING IS GOING AS PER PUBLISHERS PLANS THEN
NO BOOKS STAGNATE IN CLOSED DULL SYSTEMS DIGITAL MEDIA AS IT RIGHTFULLY SHOULD CAN BE SHAREABLE LOVELY AND ENDURING TOO
IF ONLY THERE WAS A WAY TO SHARE THOSE
I READ IT THE OVERALL STORY DIDN'T STICK WITH ME TOO WELL BUT SOME OF THE THEMES REALLY DID AND I STARTED SEEING THEM ELSEWHERE
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST HILARIOUS BOOKS I'VE EVER READ EITHER YOU JUST ENJOY IT FOR THE PLEASURE OF IT OR YOU DONT IF YOU GO SEARCHING FOR THEMES I FEEL LIKE YOU RUIN THE SIMPLE PLEASURE OF IT HE'S ALL ABOUT ABSURD LITTLE DETAILS THAT MAKE UP A LARGER PICTURE AND HOW THAT PICTURE IS INSANE AND NONSENSICAL
IN HIGHSCHOOL I READ A GROCERY BAG WORTH OF VONNEGUT BOOKS INCLUDING THIS ONE I REMEMBER LIKING IT AT THE TIME
IT WAS A POOR REPRESENTATION OF HIS WORK OVERALL BUT LIKE MOST THINGS PEOPLE READ INTO IT WHAT THEY WANTED TO AT THE TIME AND IT BECAME A THING THE ART WAS UNDERWHELMING I WAS DISAPPOINTED
IS IT YOUR FIRST VONNEGUT READ YOU SHOULDN'T READ IT TIL YOU READ HIS OTHER STUFF BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS WAS A SELF INDULGENT NOVEL THAT KIND OF CELEBRATES HIS ENTIRE LITERARY CAREER WITH A LOT OF META REFERENCES IF IT'S THE FIRST THING OF HIS YOU READ IT WILL BE ALL OUT OF CONTEXT
THANKS EVERYBODY I THINK THE GENERAL CONSENSUS IS STICK WITH IT SO I SHALL
I LOVED IT AND THE BRUCE WILLIS MOVIE IS PRETTY HILARIOUS TOO
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE FIRST FIVE CHAPTERS YOU PROBABLY WON'T LIKE THE REST EITHER PERSONALLY I FIND IT A BIT TOO BLEAK AND NOT QUITE FUNNY ENOUGH
KURT VONNEGUT IS MY FAVORITE HE'S LIKE THAT CRAZY RECLUSIVE UNCLE THAT SHOWS UP UNANNOUNCED AT A FAMILY GATHERING TELLING STORIES THAT YOU CAN'T TELL IF THEY'RE TRUTH OR FICTION BUT YOU DON'T CARE BUZ HE'S SO DAMN ENTERTAINING AND HE'S A CLEVER ONE SO THERE'S ALWAYS GOOD OBSERVATIONS ON LIFE THE HUMAN CONDITION
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS THERE'S A LOT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT EVEN DURING THE PARTS THAT MAY SEEM SILLY OR STUPID TO YOU NOW
I'D SAY STICK WITH IT IT'S A FAST READ ANYWAY AND THE THEMES IN THE BOOK ARE REALLY STRONG NONE OF THE STUFF THERE IS BY ACCIDENT IT'S ALL A VEHICLE FOR THOUGHTS
I THINK IT'S EASILY HIS WORST BOOK NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY SO MANY PEOPLE LOVE IT
IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO START WITH VONNEGUT PERSONALLY I LOVED IT AND EVEN THE CRAPPY MOVIE ADAPTATION HAD A WEIRD CHARM BUT IF YOU WANT TO READ VONNEGUT THE BEST STARTING POINT IS PROBABLY EITHER SIRENS OF TITAN ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE SCI-FI SINCE THIS IS THE CLOSEST HE GETS TO STRAIGHTFORWARD SCI-FI OR SLAUGHTERHOUSE YOU MAY NOT GET THE WRITING STYLE IN A LOT OF HIS BOOKS IF YOU'RE NOT USED TO IT
ONE OF MY FAVORITE KING VERB BOOKS HAVE YOU SEEN THE MOVIE I LAUGHED PRETTY GOOD
THE FIRST VONNEGUT NOVEL I EVER READ WAS GOD BLESS YOU MR ROSEWATER AND I'VE BASICALLY BEEN A HUGE FAN OF HIS WORK EVER SINCE I'D PROBABLY SAY A GOOD PLACE TO START WITH VONNEGUT WOULD BE IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER

CAT'S CRADLE
SIRENS OF TITAN
GOD BLESS YOU MR ROSEWATER
WELCOME TO THE MONKEY HOUSE

THOSE ARE ALL GREAT THEN YOU CAN BRANCH OFF TO GALAPAGOS BLUEBEARD BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS ECT
CATCH I READ IT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BUT NOW THAT I'M IN THE ARMY IT IS SO MUCH MORE FUNNY AND RELATABLE
I FIRST READ LORD OF THE RINGS WHEN I WAS ABOUT AND DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE BOOKS LOVED THE MOVIES BUT WAS ONLY MPH ON THE BOOKS TEN YEARS LATER THIS PAST MONTH I LISTENED TO THE UNABRIDGED AUDIOBOOKS AND LOVED THEM I THINK IT WAS MOSTLY THAT I WAS LISTENING WHILE I WORKED SO THE LENGTH WAS A PLUS AND THE PACE DIDN'T FEEL SO SLOW
I HAVE A FEELING
A TALE OF TWO CITIES BY CHARLES DICKENS I READ IT WHEN I WAS AND I WAS LIKE OHMYGODDDDD I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS THIS IS SO BORING KILL ME BUT FOR SOME REASON SYDNEY CARTON'S STORY STUCK WITH ME SO I REREAD IT WHEN I WAS OLDER AND I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH MORE SAME GOES FOR THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV SO I THINK IT'S MOSTLY TIME AND PERSPECTIVE WHICH CHANGES MY OPINION ON BOOKS

THE GREAT GATSBY STILL ANNOYS THE BEJEEZUS OUT OF ME THOUGH SO THERE'S THAT
HAMLET READ IT AS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL AND AGAIN SENIOR YEAR BUT BY THEN IT BECAME ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLAYS READ IT WITH ROSENKRANTZ GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD WHICH MADE IT MORE ENJOYABLE TOO I THINK
THE BLOCKHOLE ALSO A DISNEY MOVIE I SLOWLY READ IT THROUGHOUT THE FIFTH GRADE
YOU PEOPLE DON T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I HAD TO STOP AND RESTART MONTHS LATER BEFORE I FINISHED RAINBOW FINALLY
HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH THE JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT AND THE SATANIC VERSES BEING YOUNG AND STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WERE SOME OF THE REASONS I INITIALLY RECOILED THERE WAS ALSO THE ISSUE OF WRITING STYLE IT SORT OF OFFENDED ME BUT I HAD CONFUSED IDEAS ABOUT WHAT HAS ITS PLACE IN A BOOK BACK THEN

MAINLY I FIND THAT APPRECIATING A BOOK DEPENDS ON TIMING THOSE TWO BOOKS FOUND ME IN A GOOD PLACE THE SECOND TIME AROUND AND THE EXPERIENCE WAS GREAT
THIS MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT I WENT TO ONE OF MY FIRST BOOK FAIRS IN LIKE 1ST GRADE BOUGHT THE PRINCESS ACADEMY AND THEN HATED READING THE FIRST CHAPTER LITTLE MELODRAMATIC ME WAS CRYING FROM BOREDOM AND TOSSED THE BOOK ACROSS THE ROOM

BUT THEN I READ IT YEARS LATER AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT AND THEN IT FROM START TO FINISH AGAIN NOT TO MENTION ALL OF THE TIMES I'VE GONE BACK TO READ CERTAIN PARTS
THE GREAT GATSBY I HATED IT THE FIRST TIME THROUGH BUT WHEN I READ IT A FEW YEARS LATER I REALLY ENJOYED IT
I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE NAME OF THE ROSE BY UMBERTO ECO WHEN I READ IT ABOUT YEARS AGO I REREAD IT LAST YEAR AND LOVED IT

I HADN'T REREAD ANY SHAKESPEARE SINCE HIGH SCHOOL I JUST ASSOCIATED THEM WITH STUFF I WAS FORCE FED WHEN I PROBABLY WASN'T READY I'VE BEEN GOING BACK AND REREADING THOSE AND THEY'RE DELIGHTFUL

SPEAKING OF STUFF I WAS FORCE FED A COUPLE OF TIMES I HAVE TRIED TO REREAD GREAT EXPECTATIONS I MAKE IT ABOUT PAGES AND REMEMBER JUST HOW ANNOYING THAT DARN PIP IS AS A PROTAGONIST THAT ONE IS NEVER GOING TO GET REDEMPTION IN MY EYES
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD IT'S ALSO A VERY SHORT READ SO I SUGGEST YOU GUYS TAKE THE TIME TO CHECK IT OUT THE PAGE IS SW DESPITE BEING PLAYBOY YOU WON T NEED TO HIDE PORNOGRAPHIC ADS FROM YOUR FAMILY WHILE READING IT

LET'S DISCUSS THE STORY DID YOU GUYS LIKE IT AS MUCH AS I DID IT WAS TWISTED AS HELL BUT ALSO KIND OF CUTE STEPHEN KING IS A MASTER OF WRITING VILLAINS AND HERE HE GIVES YOU A PERFECT SNAPSHOT OF THE LIFESTYLE OF SOME REAL FREAKS I WOULD READ A FULL LENGTH NOVEL ABOUT THESE TWO AND THEIR ANTICS IT WOULD BE LIKE NATURAL BORN KILLERS MEETS THE GREAT DEPRESSION
THIS IS INTERESTING I HAD NO IDEA PLAYBOY PUBLISHED SHORT STORIES MUCH LESS STORIES BY WELL-KNOWN AUTHORS LIKE STEPHEN KING I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION PLAYBOY WAS JUST PORNOGRAPHIC PHOTOGRAPHY
DOUGLAS ADAMS
I'VE JUST RECENTLY PICKED UP THE COMPLETE WORKS OF FOLIO SCOTT FITZGERALD MOST OF THE BOOKS THAT I'VE READ WERE INDIVIDUAL BOOKS BUT THIS MOST RECENT COLLECTION I BOUGHT WAS THE COLLECTION OF THE MOST FAMOUS ALL OF THIS TO SAY THAT I LOVED THE GREAT GATSBY IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HIS SHORT STORIES ARE AMAZING AND I WANTED MORE TO READ I FIND THAT I'M MORE LIKELY TO COMPLETE AN AUTHOR'S COMPLETE WORKS IF I START WITH A BOOK SERIES

LIANE MORIARTY IS ONE AUTHOR WHOSE ENTIRE BODY OF WORK I DEVOURED IT'S HARD TO READ JUST ONE BOOK OF HERS SHE NAILS HUMAN EMOTION SO WELL
I TEND TO DO THIS A LOT ESPECIALLY IF THE AUTHOR IS DEAD I'VE READ ALL OF H PAGE HOVERCRAFT DOUGLAS ADAMS AND A TON MORE I'M CURRENTLY WORKING THROUGH KIM STANLEY BOOKS

IN A FEW CASES I DELIBERATELY DON'T READ THEM ALL I'M GOING THROUGH IAIN M BANKS VERY SLOWLY BECAUSE I'LL BE SAD WHEN I FINISH THEM I CAN'T READ THE LAST FEW DISCWORLD BOOKS AT ALL BECAUSE THEN THEY'LL BE OVER FOREVER
HECK I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT I'VE READ ABOUT HALF OF ELMORE BOOKS BECAUSE DAMN THAT MAN WROTE A LOT OF BOOKS I ACTUALLY STARTED PACING MYSELF A FEW YEARS BACK BECAUSE I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT HE WOULDN'T BE AROUND A WHOLE LOT LONGER AND I DIDN'T WANT TO RUN OUT ALTHOUGH HIS BOOKS ARE FUN TO

NOW IF ANYONE CAN SAY THAT THEY'VE READ EVERYTHING BY JOYCE CAROL OATES I'LL BE REALLY IMPRESSED
TRYING TO READ THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE TOLSTOY DOSTOYEVSKY AND JOYCE

HEMINGWAY AND GARCIA GOT ME HOOKED ON LITERARY FICTION WHEN I WAS IN HIGHSCHOOL AND I KEPT READING THEIR BOOKS UNTIL THERE WERE NO MORE LEFT

WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BOOKS I BOUGHT WHEN I MOVED TO THE US I WAS CURIOUS WHY IT WAS SO CONTROVERSIAL I LIKED IT THEN I READ ADA AND LIKED IT EVEN MORE SO I READ THE REST OF BOOKS

JEANETTE WINTER-SOWN AND MICHEL DIFFERENT STYLES BUT I LIKED HOW EACH OF THEM BROKE THE CONTEMPORARY FICTION MOULD

I'M CURRENTLY MAKING MY WAY THROUGH ISABEL AND MARIO VARGAS WORKS IN SPANISH THEY ARE BOTH GREAT STORYTELLERS ALLENDE IS MORE CONSISTENT NOT MEANING PREDICTABLE IN THEMATIC CHOICES AND QUALITY VARGAS BOOKS ARE SO DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER THAT WITHOUT THE NAME ON THE COVER I'D HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THEY WERE WRITTEN BY THE SAME PERSON I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT EACH ONE
SERGEI DOVLATOV MILAN KUNDERA MAXIM GORKY AND I'M CURRENTLY TRYING TO READ ALL OF COMPLETE WORKS
THERE WAS A PHASE IN MIDDLE HIGH SCHOOL WHERE I JUST WENT ON A TEAR THROUGH STEPHEN KING BOOKS I READ VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE LINE OF MID PAPERBACK EDITIONS EVEN THE SHORT STORIES AND DANCE MACABRE AND I RECENTLY GOT BACK INTO KING AFTER I FOUND THE GREEN MILE PAPERBACK BOSSET A FEW MONTHS BACK BEEN BUYING HARDCOVER VERSIONS JUST TO SAY I HAVE A COLLECTION BUT I STILL LOVE HIS WORK
IF I LIKE AN AUTHOR I WILL READ ALL THEIR BOOKS

STEPHEN KING IS MOSTLY DONE

IAIN M BANKS THOUGH I'VE MISSED A FEW OF HIS

DAN SIMMONS MISSING HIS HARDBOILED CRIME SERIES

AGATHA CHRISTIE I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I'M AT BUT I'VE READ A LOT OF HER NOVELS THEY'RE SO SHORT

NGAIO MARSH WORKING MY WAY THROUGH THESE ABOUT

CONNIE WILLIS ONLY A COUPLE TO GO I THINK

MARGARET ATWOOD LOTS MORE TO READ OF HERS

TAD WILLIAMS COMPLETE CAN'T WAIT FOR HIS NEW RELEASES


THERE'S PROBABLY MORE I'M A PRETTY VORACIOUS READER UNDERSTATEMENT

I MADE A POINT OF BUYING AND READING THE MORE OBSCURE NOVELS WRITTEN BY CHARLOTTE BRONTE AND ANNE BRONTE SO THAT I WOULD KNOW THE ENTIRE SET OF NOVELS WRITTEN BY THE THREE BRONTE SISTERS I ALSO HAVE A BOOK OF THEIR JUVENALIAN WHICH THEY WROTE IN COMPANY WITH THEIR ILL-FATED BROTHER BANWELL WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN BUT I HAVEN'T YET RUN ACROSS A COPY OF EMILY COMPLETE POETRY SO I CAN'T QUITE SAY I'VE READ THE BRONTES
ROBERT FROST I'VE BEEN WORKING SLOWLY THROUGH EAST EAST CUMMINGS AS WELL

I OWN A COMPREHENSIVE SHAKESPEARE VOLUME BUT IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL I HAVE TROUBLE CRACKING IT TO READ
I IMAGINE CATCHER IN THE RYE WILL GET A LOT OF MENTIONS
MEIN KAMPF
IGNATIUS IN A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES BY JOHN KENNEDY TOOLE I STILL THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS YOU'RE KIND OF SUPPOSED TO HATE HIM BUT ALSO CONNECT WITH HIM AS WELL LIKE LARRY DAVID
DELETED
THE MAIN CHARACTER FROM THE KITE RUNNER IT WAS A GREAT READ BUT FUCK THAT GUY
PROBABLY CHEATING BUT LOLITA HUMBERT IS DIDDLING A KID HARD TO REALLY VIEW HIM IN A FAVORABLE LIGHT WHEN HIS EVERY ACTION IS AN ATTEMPT TO MANIPULATE AND SEXUALLY EMOTIONALLY ABUSE A MINOR

ALSO HE'S CALLED HUMBERT HUMBERT
HARRY POTTER IN THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX HE IS JUST SO ANGST IT BOTHERS ME SO MUCH
REREADING THE INHERITANCE CYCLE IT STRUCK ME JUST HOW MUCH ARAGON WHINES IN ELDEST I ALWAYS USED TO PREFER HIS SECTIONS BUT I LATER REALISED THAT BORAN WAS SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING IN THAT BOOK
I HATED EVERYONE IN THE METAMORPHOSIS THE MAIN GUY WAS A COMPLETE PUSHOVER WHO EVERYONE STEPPED OVER HEY I JUST GOT THAT THE FAMILY WERE HORRIBLE PEOPLE TOO
SCARLETT O'HARA WHAT A MANIPULATIVE CONNIVING SPOILED BRAT THEN THE WAR HAPPENS A YOU THINK SHE HAS REDEEMED HERSELF A LITTLE STILL A BITCH THOUGH AND THAT AT LEAST THE BOOK WILL HAVE A HAPPY ENDING BUT NO IT FINISHES WITH I DON'T GIVE A DAMN AND I LITERALLY THREW THAT BOOK AGAINST THE WALL I WAS SO MAD
YES BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF MY THING I THINK IT IS AMAZING WHEN A BOOK PUTS YOU IN THE HEAD OF A TERRIBLE PERSON AND ASKS YOU TO NAVIGATE THE WORLD WITH THEM IF I WANTED TO READ A BOOK WHERE THE MC WAS DESIGNED TO BE LIKABLE OR AT LEAST SYMPATHETIC I COULD READ WELL JUST ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE WORLD MAKING A SYMPATHETIC CHARACTER SIMPLY REQUIRES IMAGINING A PERSON WITH FEW OR PERMISSIBLE FLAWS AND I FIND IT DISHONEST A LOT OF THE TIME A STORY ABOUT A GOOD PERSON IN AN IMPOSSIBLY CRUEL WORLD FEELS LIKE HOW WE ALL WANT TO VIEW OUR OWN LIVES RATHER THAN HOW THEY ACTUALLY ARE

THE SHITTY MAIN CHARACTER IS THE WRITER'S EXPLORATION OF ALL OUR OF OUR COLLECTIVE SHITTINESS AND IT'S PART OF THE CLOSEST YOU EVER GET TO LOOKING AT OTHER PEOPLE'S HORRIBLE MISDEEDS AND FLAWS WITHOUT THE SOCIAL OBLIGATION TO CONDEMN THEM

EXTRA DOUBLE BONUS POINTS IF THE MC GETS WORSE AND WORSE AS THE THING GOES ON FOR A POP CULTURE EXAMPLE WALTER WHITE GOT SHITTIER AS THE STORY WENT ON BUT THE STORY ITSELF GOT BETTER AND BETTER
GREAT EXPECTATIONS

PIP WAS KIND OF A DOUCHE FOR A LONG TIME IN THE BOOK
I'M PROBABLY IN THE MINORITY HERE BUT THE GREAT GATSBY I COULDN'T GET OVER THE FACT THAT THE ENTIRE BOOK WAS THE STORY OF A GROWN MAN WHO COULDN'T GET OVER HIS TEENAGE LOVE
THIS IS WHY I COULDN'T FINISH GONE GIRL BOTH OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS WHERE TERRIBLE PEOPLE
I AM THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO LIKES TO FIGURE THINGS OUT FOR MYSELF IF SOMEONE TELLS ME SOMETHING TASTES BAD I'LL TASTE IT TOO I AM NOT THE BANDWAGON TYPE TO TAKE EVERYONE'S WORD FOR IT

THAT SAID BELLA SWAN I READ ALL THE BOOKS AND WATCHED THE MOVIES SHE IS A TWO DIMENSIONAL PASSENGER IN HER OWN STORY I ENJOY ACTIVE PROTAGONISTS AND BELLA IS PURELY REACTIONARY NOT ONE OF HER PROBLEMS ARE EVER RESOLVED BY ANYTHING SHE DOES SHE IS FOREVER RESCUED BY OTHER PEOPLE EVEN WHEN SHE BECAME A VAMPIRE HERSELF EDWARD SAVED HER FROM EVERYTHING AND THE ONLY BOOK WHERE HE FUCKS OFF SHE BASICALLY TRIED TO KILL HERSELF AND ONLY ALICE COMING FOR HER RESOLVED THE STORY EDWARD BASICALLY KEEPS HER AS A PET HUMAN TILL HE KNOCKS HER UP IN THE LAST BOOK EDWARD IS ALSO AN IDIOT BUT HE ISN'T THE PROTAGONIST IN THE MAIN BOOKS SO THAT IS A RANT FOR ANOTHER DAY
UGLIES
THOMAS COVENANT

I CAN'T STAND THAT LEPROTIC RAPIST
EMMA BY JANE AUSTEN
BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSE TO LIKE EMMA I
THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN ALL OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS ARE HORRIBLE PEOPLE I NEEDED ABOUT A WEEK TO RECOVER
ATONEMENT OH MY GOD ATONEMENT

I READ THE BOOK WHEN I WAS AROUND I THINK AND I HATED THE MAIN CHARACTER SO MUCH THAT I REMEMBER THE EARLY PARTS OF THE BOOK VIVIDLY TO THIS DAY THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO SOMEHOW MANAGES TO FORGET DETAILS AND OFTEN ENTIRE PLOT LINES OF PRETTY MUCH EVERY BOOK SHE EVER READS

I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE COME ACROSS A CHARACTER IN ANY MEDIUM AS ABSOLUTELY UNBEARABLE AS BRIONY BACK THEN I TOLD MYSELF THAT MAYBE I WAS TOO YOUNG TO REALLY GET THE VERY GROWN UP THEMES AND THAT I MIGHT COME TO EMPATHIZE WITH HER MORE AS AN ADULT BUT NOPE I ACTUALLY HATE HER EVEN MORE NOW THAT I'M AN ADULT AND PROPERLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT SHE DID
I HATED ROMEO HE KNEW JULIET FOR A DAY AND WAS ALREADY ROLLING AROUND ON THE FLOOR WHINING ABOUT HOW HE WAS GOING TO DIE IF HE DIDN'T SEE HER AGAIN HE'S JUST AN IDIOT WHO PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE NEXT PRETTY GIRL HE SAW
QUENTIN FROM THE MAGICIANS
DIARY OF A WIMPY KID THE KID WAS JUST A PAIN IN THE ASS
KVOTHE FROM THE KING-KILLER CHRONICLE DUDE IS THE WORST YET I'M STILL POWERING THROUGH BOOK TWO AS WE SPEAK AS I TYPE
BASICALLY EVERY CHARACTER IN WUTHERING HEIGHTS I FINISHED IT ONLY BECAUSE I EXPECTED IT TO GET BETTER AT SOME POINT I KEPT WAITING FOR THE BIG TWIST THERE WAS NO TWIST JUST LOTS OF BITTER PEOPLE WITH TERRIBLE LIVES AFTERLIVES

I DON'T GET THE APPEAL OF THAT BOOK AT ALL I MEAN WE LIVE IN A WORLD WITH SO MANY BETTER BOOKS
CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IS KIND OF LIKE THAT

IT HELPED TO HAVE SIDE CHARACTERS YOU DO LIKE
AMERICAN PSYCHO BUT I THINK THAT WAS THE POINT
IT'S NOT HATE BUT I REALLY DISLIKED AMIR IN KITE RUNNER WHEN HE WAS YOUNG JUST STOOD BY AND LET HIS BEST FRIEND GET RAPED THEN FRAMED THE GUY OF THEFT S SPOILER TEXT INSIDE QUOTES
I HATED PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE IN THE GREAT GATSBY NICK IS A COLD FISH DAISY IS FRUSTRATINGLY DUMB TOM IS A TOOL AND GATSBY HIMSELF IS A HUGE DOUCHE
GONE WITH THE MAIN CHARACTER IS POSSIBLY THE BIGGEST BITCH OF ALL TIME AND THAT'S HOW THE AUTHOR WANTED IT
FRANNIE GOLDSMITH IN THE STANDARD BUT I BELIEVE IN SOME PARTS SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WHINY BECAUSE SHE WAS A TEENAGER AND PREGNANT SO IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT JEEZ IF I DIDN'T GET SICK OF IT
SOOKIE STACKHOUSE
THE SHIPPING NEWS BY E ANNIE PROULX

THE MAIN CHARACTER IS QUOYLE AND WHEN YOU MEET HIM HE IS BEING COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY CUCKOLDED BY HIS WIFE SHE'S TRYING TO DRIVE HIM TO DIVORCE HER AND SHE'S DOING IT BY BLATANTLY BRINGING MEN HOME TO HER BED AND FORCING HIM TO THE COUCH TO SLEEP WHERE HE CAN HEAR THEM HAVING SEX HE HAS BEEN SO BEATEN DOWN BY THIS PROCESS THAT HE HAS VIRTUALLY NO PERSONALITY LEFT AND HE'S ABSOLUTELY REPUGNANT IN HIS WEAKNESS HE JUST SITS THERE AND TAKES IT BECAUSE HE HONESTLY FEELS LIKE HE DESERVES IT

IF YOU CAN GET PAST THE FIRST COUPLE OF CHAPTERS THE REST OF THE STORY IS HIS RECLAMATION BUT THOSE FIRST CHAPTERS REALLY ARE A STRUGGLE TO GET THROUGH


MAZE RUNNER SILLY I KNOW BUT I COULDN'T STAND HIM
FRANKENSTEIN I DON'T KNOW THAT I REALLY HATED VICTOR BUT ALL HIS WALLOWING GOT REALLY ANNOYING
HAMLET I'VE MELLOWED OUT A LOT ON HIM NOW BUT GOOD LORD WHAT A WHINY BITCH HE IS
WHY HASN'T A CLOCKWORK ORANGE BEEN MENTIONED THE MAIN CHARACTER BASICALLY JUST RAPES PEOPLE AND COMMITS VERY QUESTIONABLE CRIMES
I LOVED THE BOOK GAME I LOVED THE CONCEPT I LOVED IMAGINING MYSELF AT BATTLE SCHOOL BUT I DID NOT LIKE ENDER
FRODO BAGGIES PRETTY MUCH DEAR GOD I KNOW HE'S GETTING MANIPULATED BY THE RING AND ALL THAT BUT FRODO IS OFTEN INSUFFERABLE AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR PALMWISE GAMGEE MERRY BRANDYBUCK AND PEREGRIN TOOK I PUT THE BOOKS DOWN IN THAT SAME VEIN ARAGON IS A JESUS ALLEGORY AND ARWEN IS BEYOND INSUFFERABLE AND THEIR ROMANCE IS A HOUSE OF CARDS

I HAVE SIMILAR FEELINGS ABOUT LUTHIER AND BEDEN IN THE SILMARILLION YES I GET IT ROMANCE BLAHBLAHBLAH BUT LUTHIER IS ONE OF THE WORST SUES I'VE EVER SEEN REGARDLESS OF IF SHE WAS A STRONG FEMALE CHARACTER FOR THE TIME
I HATED KVETCH IN NAME OF THE WIND BUT I STILL LOVE THE SERIES I ALSO HATED JACK KEROUAC IN ON THE ROAD BUT I STILL LOVED THE BOOK WILL NEVER REREAD THE ORIGINAL SCROLL VERSION FOR THE LOVE OF INDENTATIONS
NICK CARRAWAY DIDN'T EVERYONE HATE HIM MAYBE I NEED TO REREAD IT
TWILIGHT
I WANT TO SAY WUTHERING HEIGHTS I HATED HEATHCLIFF AND CATHERINE SO MUCH EVEN GOING IN KNOWING THAT WE AREN'T MEANT TO LIKE THEM I REALLY STRUGGLED TO GET THROUGH THAT BOOK I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE HUMAN COMPULSION TO MAKE THEIR OWN LIVES MISERABLE

HUMBERT HUMBERT LOLITA
THE MAIN CHARACTER OF JUST ABOUT EVERY TEENAGE DYSTOPIA FROM THE HUNGER GAMES TO DIVERGENT AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS A BLANK EVERYMAN WOMAN CHARACTER THAT THE AUTHOR INTENDS TO USE AS A VEHICLE FOR TEENAGERS TO MORE EASILY IDENTIFY WITH THE WEAK OBNOXIOUS AND ANGST MOTIVATIONS AND ACTIONS OF THE MAIN CHARACTER A DYSTOPIA ISN'T SUPPOSED TO REVOLVE AROUND YOU THAT'S THE POINT AND YET WE HAVE KATNISS AND BRISS RUNNING AROUND IN ALL THEIR GLORY TO ATTRACT A NUMBER OF ATTRACTIVE POWERFUL MEN WHO ACT MUCH MORE MATURE FOR THEIR AGE THAN THEY SHOULD

BUT THE AWARD FOR WORST HAS TO GO TO THOMAS FROM THE MAZE RUNNER LAZY ENTITLED SELF-IMPORTANT SUPERIOR RECKLESS HE IS A MARY SUE WITH A DEUS EX MACHINA MAGICAL POWER THAT ENABLES HIM TO OVERCOME ANY OBSTACLE THAT UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE LED THEIR LITTLE GROUP TO BE FLATTENED BY THE VARIOUS DYSTOPIAN PROBLEMS THEY ENCOUNTER THE POPULARITY OF TEENAGE DYSTOPIAS HAS UNFORTUNATELY COMPLETELY WATERED DOWN THE ENTIRE DYSTOPIA GENRE SO THAT WHEN YOU SAY DYSTOPIA PEOPLE WILL LEAP UP AND TALK ABOUT HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WITH KATNISS BOY TROUBLES RATHER THAN THE CRUSHING SENSE OF ALIENATION AND EVENTUAL FAILURE THAT YOU SEE IN THE REAL DYSTOPIAS
ALASTAIR REYNOLDS BOOKS CONTAIN NOT ONE LEAD CHARACTER I LIKE OR CONNECT WITH THEY ALL SEEM PETTY BAD TEMPERED HOITY GRUMPY ANTI SOCIAL TWATS WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE SOME OF THE BIG IDEAS IN HIS STORIES ARE THOUGHT PROVOKING AND EXCITING PITY THE CHARACTERS ARE SUCH DICKS

KING-KILLER CHRONICLE BY PATRICK ROTHFUSS READ 2 BOOKS STILL HATE THE MAIN CHARACTER SURE I STILL CHEER FOR HIM WHEN THERE'S SHIT GOING DOWN BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT I HATE HIM SHORTLY AFTER ARROGANT ANNOYING CLICHE

ATLAS SHRUGGED

HARRY POTTER GRANTED HE WAS WORSE IN ORDER OF THE PHOENIX BUT HE WAS NEVER GREAT HE ALWAYS GETS IN FIGHTS OFTEN WITH HIS FRIENDS WHEN HE COULD JUST NOT HE JUMPS TO CONCLUSIONS AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR A FORTUNATE HE WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT EVEN WORSE YES HE'S A TEENAGE ORPHAN WITH TROUBLES BUT HE DOESN'T GROW EMOTIONALLY AND CREATES MORE PROBLEMS FOR HIMSELF

IN THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HE PANICS AT THE STATION IF I DON'T FLY THERE I'LL NEVER EVER GO BACK TO HOGWARTS EVER HE'S GENERALLY RUDE AND CONFRONTATIONAL AT PRIVET DRIVE AND WHEN DUMBLEDORE OBVIOUSLY KNOWS SOMETHING IS UP AND EVERYONE ELSE ALREADY KNOWS HE HIDES IT FROM HIM MALLOY MOUTHY SO OBVIOUSLY MALLOY IS THE CAUSE AS ANY YEAR OLD HAS THE POWER TO DO ALL OF THAT

HE FALLS OUT WITH RON IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO TRY AND EXPLAIN OR MAKE UP WITH HIM EVEN AFTER HE'D SPOKEN TO SIRIUS IN THE FIREPLACE THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY HE LAYS INTO RITA SKEETER WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IN THE LAKE HE THINKS THAT IF HE DOESN'T SAVE EVERYONE THEY'LL BE ALLOWED TO DIE BUT DUMBLEDORE REWARDS HIM FOR MORAL FIBRE

ORDER OF THE PHOENIX HE SHOUTS AT UXBRIDGE UNTIL SHE PUNISHES HIM AND THEN PUSHES EVERYONE AWAY GETS IN A FIGHT DURING QUIDDITCH SO HE'S BANNED FROM IT AND DOESN'T LISTEN TO ADVICE ABOUT THE VISIONS THEN RUNS INTO AN OBVIOUS TRAP AND WE KNOW WHO PAYS FOR THAT WHEN HE GETS OCCLUMENCY LESSONS HE FINDS OUT WHY SNAPE RIGHTLY HATES HIS FATHER BUT DOESN'T CARE THAT HIS FATHER WAS A HUGE BULLY AND STILL HATES SNAPE

HALF-BLOOD PRINCE HE'S DETERMINED MALLOY IS TO BLAME WITH NO EVIDENCE AND JUST HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT

EACH BOOK IS A LIST OF TIMES HE STARTED FIGHTS AND PUSHED PEOPLE AWAY AS WELL AS BEING TOO THICK TO KNOW WHEN TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT OR HAVE A TINY BIT OF PATIENCE SO HE DOESN'T MAKE STUPID DECISIONS AND WHENEVER ANYTHING WENT WRONG HE RAN CRYING TO DUMBLEDORE TO MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER

AND THEN ALL HE'S A LOVELY LAD EVERYONE LOVES HIM WHAT A WONDERFUL INTELLIGENT BOY
AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON SNAPE

TL R J KING BOWLING HAS NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT SKILLS

I DID THE FIRST TWO OF THE RINGWORLD SERIES AS AUDIO BOOKS DURING MY COMMUTE ITS VERY MUCH A SLOW BURN THE STORY DOES GET BETTER BUT WHEN I TOLD MY WIFE ABOUT THEM I EXPLAINED THAT IT HARKENS BACK TO AN ERA WHEN NERDS DIDN'T GET LAID OFTEN

I LIKE SCI-FI SO I SPENT MORE TIME PLAYING WITH THE IDEA OF THE RING IT'S A FUN CONCEPT
THE WAY I SEE IT NIVEN COMES FROM A TRADITION OF SCIENCE FICTION THAT IS LESS DRIVEN BY PLOT AND CHARACTERS AND MORE DRIVEN BY CREATIVE SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS IF THE CONCEPT OF THE RINGWORLD ITSELF AND THE MYSTERIES IT CONTAINS DO NOT EXCITE YOU IT PROBABLY ISN'T THE BOOK FOR YOU THOUGH IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES THAT BEING SAID OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIRST TWO NOVELS AND THE RELATED NOVEL PROTECTOR A QUITE COMPLEX AND INTERESTING PLOT DOES DEVELOP
I DUNNO I'M NOT MUCH OF A SCIENCE FICTION FAN VONNEGUT BRADBURY HERBERT AND A FEW OTHERS I REALLY ENJOYED RINGWORLD AND THOUGHT IT WAS A QUICK AND EASY READ
THE PAGE RULE IS ALWAYS GOOD TO KEEP IN MIND IF THE BOOK DOESN'T HOLD YOUR INTEREST BY PAGES SET IT ASIDE YOU'VE GIVEN IT A FAIR CHANCE
THE CHARACTERS SEEM TOO FLAT AND UNREALISTIC AND NOTHING INTERESTING HAS REALLY HAPPENED

THIS IS EVERY NIVEN BOOK STOP AND GO TO SOMETHING BETTER
READ THE WHOLE THING WISH I HADN'T
THAT WASN'T MY EXPERIENCE WITH RINGWORLD BUT IT HAS HAPPENED WITH OTHER BOOKS I JUST STOP AND MOVE ON TO ANOTHER BOOK
I READ RINGWORLD A GOOD FEW YEARS AGO I FOUND IT QUITE BORING KEPT EXPECTING IT TO GET BETTER AND IT NEVER DID TRY HEINLEIN ASIMOV ARTHUR C CLARKE OR L RON HUBBARD
IN ITS TIME THE CONCEPT AND THE SENSE OF WONDER CAPTURE PEOPLE'S IMAGINATION IT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY WELL-WRITTEN NOVEL AND NOT MY FAVORITE NIVEN THAT WOULD BE THE MOTE IN GOD'S EYE YOU NEED TO APPRECIATE RINGWORLD AS A PULPY SF ADVENTURE WITH SOME BREATHTAKING IMAGES
IT'S A BORING BOOK
YOU ARE NOT ALONE IT WAS A TOUGH READ THE CONCEPT WAS GREAT THE BOOK GETS HARDER AND HARDER TO READ AFTER HALF WAY THROUGH
RINGWORLD IS CHIEF AMONG THOSE BOOKS OF HEY THERE ARE DECENT IDEAS HERE LET'S NOT USE ANY OF THEM

THE OLD RPG BOOKS FOR THE SETTING DO A MUCH BETTER JOB THAN THE BOOK ITSELF
I READ THE WHOLE THING IT'S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT BUT THE WRITING IS FLAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN IT
THANK YOU

IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THIS BOOK AND IT'S SEQUELS HELD A STRANGELY HIGH POSITION GIVEN ITS TERRIBLE QUALITY

NOT ONLY IS THE WRITING SHODDY BUT THE PLOT SEEMS TO FOCUS TO A GREAT EXTENT ON THE SEXUAL EXPLOITS WALLOWS IN THEM EVENING

THERE ARE SOME REDEEMING PARTS SOME OF THE ENGINEERING DETAILS ARE VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT BUT THAT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TO GET PAST THE BOOKS SHORTCOMINGS IN MY OPINION

THERE ARE OOOO MANY GREAT BOOKS OUT THERE IT SEEMS A SHAME TO WASTE TIME ON THIS KIND OF DRIVEL


I'VE NOT ACTUALLY READ RINGWORLD BUT I'VE READ SOME OF THE SEQUELS AS WELL SOME OF OTHER STUFF HE'S NOT A SCINTILLATING WRITER OF PROSE IT MUST BE SAID HIS CHARACTERS ALL HAVE SIMILAR VOICES AND ARE ALL EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT IN A SIMILAR WAY WHICH LEADS TO LEAPS IN THE DIALOGUE THAT I HAVE TROUBLE KEEPING UP WITH AS A WRITER OF SF IDEAS HE'S SECOND TO NONE AND I CAN'T THINK OF MANY AUTHORS WHO WRITE ABOUT ALIENS AS CREATIVELY AS HE DOES
I JUST FINISHED IT LAST NIGHT I LOVED THE CONCEPT OF THE RINGWORLD ITSELF BUT PRETTY MUCH LOATHED THE CHARACTERS AND FOUND THEIR MOTIVATIONS TO BE VERY STRANGE

MAYBE I'M BEING PETTY BUT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PUPPETEERS MADE ME IMAGINE A PRETTY AWFUL LOOKING CHARACTER PHYSIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING TWO LONG NECKS WITH PREHENSILE MOUTHS AND A FURRY HUMP BETWEEN THEM I JUST WISHED NESSUS WERE A COOLER LOOKING ALIEN I GUESS SPEAKER WAS OKAY BUT I BASICALLY JUST IMAGINED HIM AS A HE-MAN VILLAIN FIGURE

ALSO WHY DID IT TAKE LOUIS SO LONG TO FIGURE OUT THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY CALLED PUPPETEERS BECAUSE THEY PULL THE STRINGS AND CONTROL OTHER SPECIES

I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE BREEDING FOR LUCK BITS AT ALL IT SEEMED TOO AND OUT OF PLACE FOR A SCI-FI STORY AND WHAT WAS THE END GOAL OF THIS LUCK THAT LEELA WOULD GET TO THE RINGWORLD FOR WHAT END THAT SHE'D SURVIVE A GALACTIC CORE EXPLOSION IN YEARS SHE'S ONLY HUMAN BUT WITH THEIR LONGEVITY MEDICINES WOULD SHE REALLY LIVE THAT LONG THE ONE SENTENCE THAT REALLY BUGGED ME WAS WHEN I THINK LOUIS SAID THAT ALL DEATH AND DISEASE WAS FROM BAD LUCK SO LEELA MIGHT LIVE FOREVER IT MADE NO SENSE TO ME

ALSO AS COOL AS THE RINGWORLD WAS THERE WAS LITTLE OF INTEREST ON IT JUST A BUNCH OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLE AND SOME WEIRD SUNFLOWERS THAT WOULD BURN ANYTHING IN THEIR PATHS HE MISSED A BIG OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOUNTER ALIENS AND WEIRD FLORA AND FAUNA

THE WIRE WAS A COOL ELEMENT

I FOUND MYSELF WISHING IT WERE A MORE CONVENTIONAL AND SUSPENSEFUL STORY IN WHICH SOME HUMAN EXPLORERS DISCOVER THE RINGWORLD AND A THRIVING ALIEN CIVILIZATION

ALSO IT ENDED TOO SOON NIVEN GIVEN US A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HOW LOUIS AND SPEAKER COULD EVEN RETURN TO THE SHIP AFTER PLUMMETING THE FLOATING POLICE STATION UGH THROUGH THE FIST OF GOD CRATER

TL R COOL CONCEPTS LAME CHARACTERS WEIRD MOTIVATIONS UNSATISFYING PLOT
THE WRITING AND STORY BOTH FELL FLAT FOR ME WHEN I READ IT AS WELL IT'S PROBABLY BETTER SUITED FOR A YOUNGER AUDIENCE
I READ IT BUT DIDN'T LIKE IT KEPT THINKING IT WOULD GET BETTER BUT IT NEVER DID I THINK THAT I MIGHT NOT BE THE TARGET AUDIENCE I GREW UP PLAYING HALO SO THE CONCEPT OF A RINGWORLD IS NOT NEARLY AS MIND-BLOWING AS THE AUTHOR PROBABLY INTENDED IT TO BE
I WAS VERY AFFECTED BY THE ACCENT OF MARK WRITING I OFTEN PRESENT MY WORDS SLIGHTLY OUT OF ORDER FOR COMEDIC EFFECT HIS DEADPAN NARRATION JUXTAPOSED WITH ABSURD COLLOQUIAL DIALOGUE MAKE FOR REALLY UNHEARD-OF LEVELS OF SNARK
SO YOU TALK LIKE A NEW ENGLANDER I'M FROM NEW ENGLAND SO KING BOOKS ARE JUST HOW PEOPLE I KNOW TALK HOWEVER I NEVER ACTUALLY SPOKE LIKE A DARK TOWER CHARACTER BECAUSE IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING I OFTEN FIND MYSELF TEMPTED TO SAY SILLY STUFF LIKE THANKEE SAI FOR THIS WONDERFUL PALAVER OR YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THE FACE OF YOUR FATHER
I WAS REALLY INTO EMILY DICKINSON WHEN I WAS AM I'VE NOTICED THAT I HAVE A TENDENCY TO USE EMDASHES AND PARENTHETICAL PHRASES MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE THOUGH THIS EXPRESSES MORE IN WRITING THAN IN SPEAKING
SOMETIMES MY HUSBAND SHOCKS ME WHEN HE KISSES ME I BLAME THE CARPET AND SOCK FEET
I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT SEXUAL TENSION I'VE DEFINITELY BEEN IN SITUATIONS IN THE PAST WHERE I WAS SO ATTRACTED TO SOMEONE THAT THEM TOUCHING MY ARM OR WHATEVER WAS ALMOST ELECTRIC THE FIRST PHYSICAL CONTACT YOU HAVE WITH SOMEONE YOU'RE INTO IS ALWAYS EXCITING EVEN IF IT'S JUST HOLDING HANDS
WHEN YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO SOMEONE PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH THEM FEELS GOOD BECAUSE THE BRAIN REACTS TO IT BY PRODUCING NATURAL DRUGS THAT CAN BE INTENSE AND I IMAGINE EVERY PERSON FEELS IT A BIT DIFFERENTLY

THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO EXPERIENCE OR SYNESTHESIA LOOK UP ASME OR BRAIN ORGASMS MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS SEEM TO BE TRIGGERED BY SIBILANT SOUNDS WHISPERING CRINKLING PAPER OR NYLON SNIPPING OF SCISSORS ETC WHAT THESE SOUNDS HAVE IN COMMON IS THEY SKEW TOWARDS HIGH FREQUENCY COMPONENTS THAT POINTS TO A PHYSIOLOGICAL CAUSE THOSE WITH TACTILE ASME HAVE A PLEASURE RESPONSE WHEN A PART OF THE BODY IS TOUCHED THAT'S USUALLY NOT CONSIDERED SEXUAL OR EROTIC EAST G BACK OF THE HAND OR SPECIFIC SPOT ON THE BACK OR NECK
I REALLY LIKE TOUCHING AND BEING TOUCHED BY PEOPLE I LOVE BUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE FICTION ODD TO ME MAYBE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DESCRIBE SEX AND ORGASM THIS IS USED A STAND-IN DEVICE TO CONVEY INTENSE PHYSICAL PASSION
INTERESTING TOPIC THIS HAS DEFINITELY BECOME SOMETHING OF A CLICHE IN MODERN YA BOOKS BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE IT IS TO AN EXTENT TRUE IN THE BEGINNING OF TWO RELATIONSHIP I'VE HAD WHEN WE WERE BOTH STILL NEW AND NERVOUS PHYSICAL CONTACT HOLDING HANDS AND THE LIKE ON SEVERAL INSTANCES FELT LIKE AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CONTACT WAS UNEXPECTED BUT AUTHORS SEEM TO THIS INFREQUENT SENSATION FOR EFFECT
A SHOCK RAN THROUGH ME THE FIRST TIME I TOUCHED MY CRUSH IN CHEM CLASSICAL IT WAS DURING A STATIC ELECTRICITY DEMONSTRATION AND WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO LINK HANDS FOR THE DEMO BUT STILL IT COUNTS
I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS A REAL THING BUT THE COMMENTS SEEM TO SAY OTHERWISE

SCIENTISTS SHOULD SERIOUSLY STUDY THIS
THE FEELING OF TOUCHING SOMEONE YOU REALLY LIKE IS VERY HARD TO DESCRIBE I SUPPOSE THAT WHEN YOU ARE NEW TO IT IT MIGHT BE HARD UNDERSTAND THE FEELING IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS AUTHORS DESCRIPTION IS LAZY UNLESS PERHAPS THIS IS OR FANTASY

THERE'S ALWAYS A LITTLE TRUTH TO IT AND A LITTLE EXAGGERATION THAT SAID I DEFINITELY THINK WITH THE RIGHT PERSON YOU DO FEEL IT
EDIT THIS SEEMS TO BE OVERUSED TODAY WHICH GETS ON MY NERVES SOMEWHAT
YES GOODNESS YES
THE MAN IN THE YELLOW HAT FED GEORGE DESSERT AND A TUMMY ACHE FOLLOWED
THIS BOTHERS ME MORE THAN IT SHOULD I GUESS I KEEP SEEING HEADLINES ADVERTISING THIS AS A CHILDREN'S BOOK AS IF STEPHEN KING IS MAKING HIS FIRST FORAY INTO CHILDREN'S FICTION IF ANYTHING THIS IS A PIECE OF TIE-IN MEDIA TO THE DARK TOWER SERIES IT'S MORE LIKE WHEN THEY MADE THE TALLBOY AFTER HOME ALONE 2 CAME OUT THAN A NEW TITLE BY KING

IT IS BASED ON A PASSAGE FROM DARK TOWER III THE WASTELANDS WHERE JAKE READS THIS VERY BOOK THE ORIGINAL RELEASE OF THE NOVEL EVEN HAS SOME ILLUSTRATIONS SIMILAR TO THE ONES IN THIS NEW VERSION BUT THIS IS NOT A PIECE OF NEW FICTION THAT ALL KING FANS WILL WANT AND PROBABLY NOT SOMETHING THAT WILL APPEAL TO MOST CHILDREN

PERSONALLY I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS THEY RELEASED SOME COPIES AT SAN DIEGO COMIC CON IN JULY AS AN EXCLUSIVE AND I WAS AFRAID THERE WOULD BE NO MASS RELEASE HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S BOOK AND IT HAS A VERY NICHE APPEAL TO FANS OF THE DARK TOWER
NED DAMERON ABSOLUTELY NAILED THE COVER ILLUSTRATION IT CAPTURES EXACTLY HOW IT WAS DESCRIBED IN THE DARK TOWER
THIS PERTURBS ME IF YOU'VE READ THE DARK TOWER SERIES THIS IS A GREAT PIECE OF MEMORABILIA I'M GONNA GRAB ME A COPY

THE FACE IS JUST AS EERIE AS I IMAGINED WHEN I WAS READING THE DARK TOWER
NEXT IN THE SERIES BLAINE THE PAIN
PLEASE IF THERE IS A MERCIFUL GOD LET IT BE FOCUSED ON BLAINE THE TRAIN
TIME TO USHER IN A NEW GENERATION OF NIGHTMARE FUEL
I PREORDERED MINE ON AMAZON AND I GOT IT FOR SHIPPING SOON
COULD THE MOVIE BE BASED AROUND THE TRAIN IT COULD BE INTERESTING TO OR FROM THE SETTING OF THE TRAIN CHOO-CHOO
THEY DID A GREAT JOB AT MAKING THE COVER LOOK LIKE IT WAS DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK ITS ONLY WHEN YOU LOOK CLOSER THAT THE KIDS KINDA LOOK LIKE THEY'RE SCREAMING AND THE FACE
YES PLEASE MEANWHILE CAN WE SEE A MOVIE VERSION OF THE EYES OF THE DRAGON
SAW THIS AS AN EXCLUSIVE AT DCC STOKED TO KNOW THEY'RE RELEASING IT TO THE PUBLIC
IT'S NOT SET IN THE DT UNIVERSE WHICH IS BASICALLY THE KING UNIVERSE ANYWAY IT EXISTS IN THAT UNIVERSE IT'S A FICTIONAL BOOK THAT SOMEHOW ESCAPED ITS FICTIONAL UNIVERSE FOR OURS
BLAINE THE FUCKING PSYCHO TRAIN
HELL YEH
AND WHEN YOUR A TEEN THERE JUST RIGHT
APPARENTLY DOESN'T WRITE ENOUGH GARBAGE NEEDS MORE
WHY DO YOU FEEL ASHAMED OF YOUR LITERATURE TASTE IF YOU ONLY LIKE FANTASY AND THINK REGULAR LITERARY FICTION IS BORING THEN SO BE IT READ WHATEVER YOU LIKE I FOR ONE DON'T ENJOY FANTASY BOOKS AND PREFER NOVELS SET IN THE REAL WORLD I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE FANTASY AND LITERARY FICTION BUT ARE SUPERFAN OF ALIEN FARMER EROTIC SHORT STORIES WHO CARES LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO READ BAD BOOKS
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I FIND NOVELS ABOUT EVERYDAY LIFE OF CONTEMPORARY PEOPLE BORING AS I DO NOT HAVE TO READ BOOKS IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE EVERYDAY LIFE WHILE FANTASY CHARACTERS EVENTS ARE AVAILABLE ONLY IN LITERATURE SINCE THEY DO NOT EXIST IN REAL LIFE AND WHAT IS THE POINT OF READING ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH I CAN DIRECTLY EXPERIENCE

I'D SAY THAT'S JUST ONE SUBGENRE OF LITERARY FICTION AND DEFINITELY NOT MY PREFERRED ONE THOUGH IF THE NARRATOR OR SUBJECT MATTER IS COMPELLING ENOUGH IT DOESN'T MATTER

BUT IF YOU'D LIKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OF THINGS IN THAT GENRE THAT MADE A BIG IMPRESSION ON ME

TURTLE DIARY BY RUSSELL HOBAN IS A QUIET FUNNY OFTEN DEVASTATING BOOK ABOUT TWO LONELY MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE ALTERNATING AS NARRATORS MEETING THROUGH THEIR MUTUAL OBSESSION WITH THE IDEA OF FREEING A SEA TURTLE FROM THE LONDON AQUARIUM

THE LAST SAMURAI BY HELEN DEWITT IS VERY HARD TO SUMMARIZE BUT IT'S MAYBE THE MOST BRILLIANT BOOK I'VE READ THAT WAS PUBLISHED THIS CENTURY

ZAZEN BY VANESSA VESELKA IS ABOUT A YOUNG WOMAN TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE RADICAL QUEER VEGAN COMMUNITIES IN PORTLAND AS THE WORLD IS DESCENDING INTO CHAOS

ALSO ONE OF THE FIRST BIG LITERARY CLASSICS I READ WAS THE MASTER AND MARGARITA WHICH IS COMPLICATED AND HAS LOTS OF STUFF ABOUT SOVIET OPPRESSION AND CENSORSHIP AND RELIGIOUS HISTORY BUT THERE'S ALSO THE DEVIL WITCHES AND A HUGE TALKING CAT
YOU COULD TRY SOME OF DAVID WORK HE'S KNOWN FOR BENDING GENRES AND COMBINES LITERARY FICTION WITH SOME FANTASTICAL ELEMENTS SO THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD START TO TRY GET INTO LITERARY FICTION THIS ARTICLE GIVES HIS OPINION ON THE LITERARY VS GENRE WAR MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR YOU TO READ GIVEN YOUR FEELING OF BEING STUCK IN FANTASY READING
I ACTUALLY KIND OF REALIZED THAT NOT TOO LONG AGO MYSELF I ALSO USUALLY READ FANTASY WHEN I READ FICTION AT THE NEXT USED BOOK SALE I WENT TO I MADE IT A POINT TO GET ANY GENERAL FICTION BOOK THAT LOOKED REMOTELY INTERESTING I'M WORKING MY WAY THROUGH THEM AND SOME AREN'T BAD MY SUGGESTION IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT IS TO GET RECOMMENDATIONS OR BEST SELLER LISTS AND TRY THOSE THINGS THAT LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE LIKED ARE USUALLY LIKED FOR A REASON THOUGH THAT CAN FAIL OF COURSE I HATED A LITTLE LIFE ONE OF THE BOOKS I GOT AT THAT SALE WAS A MAN NAMED OME BY FREDERIK BACKMAN IT'S A SWEDISH BOOK THAT WAS REALLY GOOD
READ AND WRITE WHAT YOU ENJOY

I FIND THAT I HAVE MORE NIGHTMARES ABOUT REALITY THAN ANYTHING FANTASTICAL SO FOR THE MOST PART I STICK TO GENRE FICTION GETTING A DECENT SLEEP IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME

WILL THERE EVER BE A DAY THAT I LOOK UP AND REALIZE I WANT TO READ ABOUT REALITY MAYBE AND WHEN THAT DAY COMES I WILL HAVE LOTS TO CHOOSE FROM AND LOTS OF REVIEWS TO HELP ME FIND THE GOOD STUFF

IF YOU ASK ME A LOT OF CONTEMPORARY FICTION IS TEDIOUSLY SELF IMPORTANT AND NOT INFREQUENTLY DEPRESSING AND FRIGHTENING DON'T NEED OR WANT THAT IN MY ENTERTAINMENT SO I TEND TO SKIP IT

I DO SOMETIMES WISH I COULD GO BACK TO COLLEGE AND STUDY MORE LITERATURE BUT I GUESS THAT'S MORE TO FIND A AURATED READING LIST STRUCTURED GROUP OF BOOKS AND THE INTERACTION WITH THE TEACHERS AND PEOPLE TAKING THE COURSE I'M NOT ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN READING THE THOUSAND MOST IMPORTANT WORKS OF LITERATURE IN THE WORLD MOSTLY BECAUSE WITHOUT HAVING A SENSE OF THEIR PLACE IN LITERARY HISTORY IN CONTEXT OF THEIR AUTHOR'S WORLD AND THEIR STATED GOALS WITHIN THEIR CULTURE I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH I COULD APPRECIATE THE WORKS

I GUESS WHAT I REALLY WANT IS A SIMULTANEOUS SENSE OF HISTORY LITERARY ARTISTIC POLITICAL CULTURAL AS I READ SO THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS TRYING TO SAY AND OR ACHIEVE AND HOW IT REFLECTS THE MOMENT OF ITS CREATION IN A CULTURAL SENSE TRYING TO BROADEN MY TASTES BEYOND THE OLD FASHIONED CANON OF EUROPEAN WHITE MEN AND IT'S TOUGH TO DO WITHOUT CONTEXT I REALLY ENJOY THAT BUT SELDOM ACHIEVE THAT WHEN READING ON MY OWN
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WORKS THAT ARE REGULARS ON THE LITERARY CANON AND ALSO FANTASTICAL MYTHOLOGY IS THE OBVIOUS BRIDGE BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS EVERYONE SHOULD READ GILGAMESH JUST TO KNOW THAT THE TWO HAVE GONE TOGETHER SINCE THE BEGINNING THE INTROSPECTIVE NOVEL ABOUT ORDINARY PEOPLE IS A GREAT THING BUT IT WAS ONLY REALLY INVENTED IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING WAS FANTASTICAL TO SOME DEGREE

THEN MORE RECENTLY YOU'VE GOT KAFKA BORGES MARQUEZ BULGAKOV AND MANY MORE THE MOST ESSENTIAL WORK I CAN THINK OF FOR SOMEONE INTERESTED IN THE OVERLAP BETWEEN MYTHOLOGY FANTASY AND MODERN PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE IS DON QUIXOTE
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD FEEL ASHAMED IN THE LEAST BUT SOME MAINSTREAM CONTEMPORARY REALISTIC LIT I HAVE LOVED VERY MUCH ARE THINGS BY ANN PATCHETT BEL CANTO IS LIFE PAT CONROY ESP PRINCE OF TIDES JOHN IRVING WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP ANNE TYLER ACCIDENTAL TOURIST DIGGING TO AMERICA
I REALLY HOPE THOSE AREN'T MEANT TO BE SCORES AFTER THE TITLES
FOR THE SAME REASON PEOPLE DON'T WRITE FUTURIST BOOKS OR BEAT BOOKS OR BOOKS FROM ANY OTHER BYGONE LITERARY MOVEMENT THE IDEA ARRIVED PEOPLE DISCUSSED IT THEY TOOK WHAT THEY LIKED FROM IT AND MOVED ON TO SOMETHING ELSE LIKE YOU'VE NOTICED THERE ARE BOOKS TODAY THAT ARE INFLUENCED BY THE EXISTENTIALISTS BUT NOBODY WANTS TO READ A BOOK THAT'S JUST A OF SOMETHING SIXTY YEARS OLD
THOSE BOOKS WERE WRITTEN AT A TIME WHEN SOCIAL MORAL POLITICAL VALUES IN THE WESTERN WORLD WERE TAKEN FOR GRANTED THEN A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS ASKED WHY NOW IN THE ERA EVERYONE GROWS UP QUESTIONING EVERYTHING AND ASSUMING THAT EVERYTHING IS THERE'S NO REASON TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT IT NOW WE'RE ALL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT MEANING BACK IN THINGS INSTEAD OF TAKING IT OUT JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WHAT ABSURDISM IS THE ONLY BOOK YOU MENTIONED THAT'S TRULY ABSURDIST IS THE STRANGER

ABSURDISM WAS A PRODUCT OF WW2 THERE IS A TON OF ABSURDIST LITERATURE OUT THERE BASED ON THE BOOKS YOU CHOSE TO MENTION YOU HAVEN'T READ MANY OF THEM ABSURDISM IS OFTEN AN UNDERTONE IN MANY BOOKS THESE DAYS CHECK OUT THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE WINNER FROM THIS YEAR THE SELLOUT

LIKE MOST LITERARY MOVEMENTS THE TOPIC THEMES GET PUSHED TO THEIR LIMIT AND OR EXHAUSTED THOSE TOPICS THEMATIC ELEMENTS ARE PUSHED ASIDE FOR A FEW YEARS THEN THE DUST SETTLES AND AUTHORS START TO MESS WITH THE THEMES AGAIN IN LESS OBVIOUS WAYS MINOR THEMES INSTEAD OF WHOLE PLOTS

IF YOU WANT ABSURDIST LIT READ EVERYTHING BECKETT WROTE ESP MOLLOY MALONE DIES AND THE UNNAMABLE READ PINTER IONESCO EVEN CATCH IF YOU HAVEN'T THERE'S PLENTY OUT THERE
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED I THINK THAT ABSURDISM EXISTENTIALISM IS AN EASILY PHILOSOPHY WITH REGARD TO DEPICTING IT IN FICTION I MEAN YOU GET IT ALREADY DON'T YOU HOW MANY MORE DREARY LIVES DO YOU NEED TO SEE
THOSE STYLES ARE LIKE CERTAIN WINES WHEN THEY AGE WELL THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AND COVETED IT MAY BE THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DISTANCE YET BETWEEN CAMUS SARTRE O'TOOLE AND THE CURRENT WRITERS
I READ THIS A LONG TIME AGO
IS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD BE LOOKING FOR I REMEMBER IT BEING PRETTY GOOD
ZERO K DON LATEST IS ABOUT THE MEANING OR OTHERWISE OF LIFE IT IS RELENTLESSLY DARK

SATIN ISLAND BY TOM MCCARTHY SAME

LINKS TO MY DETAILED READING JOURNALS ABOUT BOTH OF THEM HERE UNDER RECENTLY FINISHED
HAVE YOU READ THE NEWS LATELY NO NEED FOR THAT TYPE OF FICTION THESE DAYS
IF SOMEONE EXPRESSED THE IDEAS EXPRESSED BY THE OP TO ME IN REAL LIFE I WOULD PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE
I WOULD SAY THAT WHITE NOISE MAKES THE GRADE THOUGH IT IS TECHNICALLY A POSTMODERN BOOK BUT ANYWAY MOST OF THESE BOOKS CAME MANY YEARS APART AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW WELL-KNOWN THEY WERE AT THE TIME MAYBE THERE ARE ALREADY GREAT EXISTENTIALIST BOOKS FROM THE MODERN AGE THAT JUST HAVEN'T BEEN RECOGNIZED YET

ALSO SIDENOTE ARE THOSE SCORES FOR THE BOOKS OR WHAT
I DON'T THINK
ACTUALLY THERE ARE STILL ABSURDIST BOOKS BEING WRITTEN BUT THE ONES I'VE SEEN AND READ ARE FROM SMALL PRESSES IF YOU CAN FIND A COPY RAY TALES FROM THE VINEGAR WASTELAND MIGHT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT HAD TWO EDITIONS BUT BOTH PRESSES AFTERBIRTH LEGUMEMAN CLOSED THEIR DOORS YEARS AGO
EXISTENTIALISM SORT OF WENT OUT OF STYLE WHEN STRUCTURALISM AND CAME ALONG BUT THERE'S A BIT OF A RESURGENCE NOW MAYBE WE'LL SEE THAT REFLECTED IN FICTION
EVERYONE GETS A FIREHOUSE OF ABSURDIST ART FROM THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS NOT SARCASTIC ABOUT THAT EVERYONE THINKS THEY'RE MAGRITTE INCLUDING ME
THIS IS AN INTERESTING AND PERHAPS EVEN AN ACUTE QUESTION ONE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS THAT THE LIKES OF HESSE ARE DIFFICULT TO BEAT ON THEIR OWN BACKYARD BUT THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE WEST MIGHT BRING EXISTENTIALISM BACK ON TO THE FRAME MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT GERMAN SCHOOL KIDS STILL HAVE TO READ THE LIKES OF DOBLIN AND HESSE SO EXISTENTIALISM IS FAR FROM GONE FROM THE WORLD
BECAUSE IT'S A DATED PHILOSOPHICAL IDEOLOGY THAT FELL OUT OF FASHION LIKE YEARS AGO

I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THE NUMBERS NEXT TO THE BOOK TITLES MEAN ARE THOSE SUPPOSED TO BE SCORES
BECAUSE THERE WOULDN'T BE A POINT TO WRITE THEM
I GOT ONE CAN'T GET AN AGENT NO MARKET FOR THE HUMAN AWAKENING TO REALITY
I LOVE OLDER BOOKS LIKE THAT SOMETIMES THEY'RE TERRIBLE AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE AMAZING OVERLOOKED GEMS WHO KNOWS MAYBE YOU HAVE THE NEXT STONER BY JOHN WILLIAMS ON YOUR HANDS IT WAS A NOVEL THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN BUT FLOPPED UNTIL IT BECAME SUPER POPULAR IN THE MID AFTER THE AUTHOR'S DEATH READ IT AND LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
IF THE AUTHOR DIDN'T WRITE ANY MORE BOOKS THAT WERE NOTEWORTHY I THINK IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THAT HE WAS JUST FORGOTTEN GOD KNOWS HOW MANY DECENT BOOKS FROM YEARS AGO WERE LOST IN TIME
IT SEEMS TO BE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL FROM MY WEE SEARCH AND I FOUND ALOT OF SECOND HAND COPIES FOR SALE HERE IN THE UK MAYBE JUST AN OBSCURATION BY A RANDOM GUY WHO GOT LUCKY FOR ONCE AND PUBLISHED
SEE IF YOUR LIBRARY HAS A COPY

TITLE LOSER OCLC

IT APPEARS TO BE A PERSONAL NARRATIVE DEALING WITH GAMBLING

THIS BOOK APPEARS TO MENTION IT

HERE IT IS ON GOODREADS NOT MUCH INFO THOUGH

IF YOU COULDN'T FIND IT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE SPELLING HOFFMAN WITH TWO NOUNS
HE JERKED OFF WITH THE DETERMINATION OF SOMEONE WITHIN SIGHT OF EVEREST S SUMMIT HAVING LOST ALL HIS FRIENDS AND SHERPAS HAVING RUN OUT OF SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN BUT PREFERRING DEATH TO FAILURE
REDDIN
A USEFUL RESOURCE FOR EVERYONE WHO LIKES THESE AWARDS AS MUCH AS I DO

THE EXTRACTS FROM THIS YEAR'S SHORT-LIST THAT GOT THE WRITERS NOMINATED
MY FAVOURITE
NEVER FORGET DICK ATTACK HETP
I FIND THAT SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS ARE PARTICULARLY BAD AT SEX SCENES ASIMOV IS ONE NOTORIOUS EXAMPLE
ANYBODY LISTENED TO THE PODCAST MY DAD WROTE A PORNO IT'S A COMEDY PODCAST ABOUT THE EROTIC BOOK BELINDA BLINKED THE BOOK WOULD WIN EVERY AWARD OUT THERE FOR BAD SEX IN WRITING I HESITATE TO CALL THE BOOK LITERATURE LOL
I THINK IT'D BE FUNNY IF CLEARLY WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO JUST DISCOVERED SEX HE SHOVED HIS GIANT WIENER INTO HER AND JACKHAMMERED HER LIKE A CHEETAH UNTIL HE PULLED OUT AND BLASTED HIS STRUDEL ICING ALL OVER HER BIG BOOBIES
DESPITE THE IMMEDIATE CIRCUMSTANCES HUMAN NATURE OBLIGED HIM TO TAKE A LOOK AT HER PASSPORT PHOTO

GOD DAMMIT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
BUT WHY EVEN BOTHER TRYING TO OUTDO SHADES OF GREY AT THIS POINT

WHY AM I FINDING IT SO DIFFICULT TO SIMPLY FIND A LIST OF THE CURRENTLY NOMINATED PASSAGES I MANAGED TO FIND LAST YEAR'S
THIS BEGS THE QUESTION IS THERE A BAD SEX IN NONFICTION AWARD I CAN'T RECALL ANY TIME I'VE EVER READ A SEX SCENE IN A NONFICTION BOOK
HER BREASTS WERE LIKE BAGS OF SAND
NOTHING BY CHUCK TINGLE SACRILEGE ALTHOUGH I GUESS HE DID GET NOMINATED FOR A HUGO AWARD SO AT LEAST THAT'S SOMETHING
HAD PETER HAMILTON WRITTEN A BOOK THIS YEAR IF HE HAS I'LL GIVE HIM THE AWARD SIGHT UNSEEN I LOVE THAT MAN'S FICTION BUT THE AWFUL LITEROTICA HE ALWAYS PUTS INTO HIS BOOKS IS THE WORST IF THERE IS A BOOK OF HIS WHERE AN YEAR OLD LOOKING GIRL OR ACTUAL YEAR OLD DOESN'T AT SOME POINT BANG AN OLDER DUDE OH LET'S SAY ABOUT THE AGE OF PETER HAMILTON I'LL EAT IT

I WON'T IT WAS HYPERBOLE GOING FOR EFFECT I'M SURE HE HAS WRITTEN SOMETHING WHERE HE DOESN'T DO THIS I JUST HAVE NOT READ IT HE HAS DONE RIGHT
WHAT IS IT ABOUT SEX THAT MAKES IT SO HARD TO WRITE WELL ABOUT EVEN PEOPLE LIKE IAN MCEWAN HAVE BEEN SHORTLISTED FOR THE BAD SEX AWARD
THIS WHOLE THING JUST SUCKS HALF OF THEM ARE NOT THAT BAD TYPICALLY AND THE WHOLE THING IS JUST WAY TO POKE FUN AT VOICES AND GENRES THE AUTHOR'S DON'T LIKE
I ACTUALLY DID WORK EXPERIENCE AT LITERARY REVIEW ONCE WHEN THE BAD SEX AWARD WAS COMING UP NOT TO TAKE AWAY FROM IT AS IT DOES HIGHLIGHT SOME TRULY AWFUL WRITING BUT THEY DO GO ABOUT IT QUITE CYNICALLY AS THE INTERN I WAS HANDED A STACK OF EVERY MAJOR RELEASE THAT YEAR AND TOLD TO FLICK THROUGH THEM AND MARK ANY SEX SCENES THEY WOULD READ AND JUDGE THEM PROPERLY BUT IT WAS APPROACHED MORE FROM THE SENSE OF LET'S FIND THE BIGGEST NAME BOOK WE CAN TAKE DOWN A FEW NOTCHES THAN LET'S HIGHLIGHT A PARTICULARLY BAD PIECE OF WRITING WE ENCOUNTERED THIS YEAR I REMEMBER THEY WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT J KING THE CASUAL VACANCY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO JUSTIFY THE AWARD AS THEY REALLY WANTED TO PIN IT ON THAT
GOD THAT GAYLE FORMAN QUOTE IS JUST AWFUL WRITING IT READS LIKE A DAN BROWN PARODY

HIS HANDS WHICH WERE EVERYWHERE AS IF HE WERE RAVENOUS

LIKE SHE WAS A VIRGIN LIKE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME

SHE D THOUGHT HE WAS JUST EXCITED TURNED ON

I'M WEIRD ABOUT MIXING PASSAGES ABOUT FELLATIO WITH REFERENCES TO PIMPLES THAT ALONE SHOULD HAVE BEEN EDITED OUT
HIS HOT LOAD SHOT INTO HER MOUTH WHILE HER PASSPORT FELL TO THE HERPETIC FLOOR
IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HER THAT HE MIGHT BE TERRIFIED TOO

OKAY MAYBE YOU SHOULD REASSESS THIS ARRANGEMENT
WHERE IS CHUCK TINGLE
WELL I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE NEAL STEPHENSON AND PIERS ANTHONY BUT THEN I REALIZED THEY DIDN'T PUT OUT ANY BOOKS THIS YEAR ONE IS FIXATED ON TEENAGERS AND THE OTHERS SEX SCENES CONSIST OF ONE PUMP CHUMPS
R TITLEGORE
WASN'T THIS POSTED ALREADY ONCE THIS MORNING
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT FICTIONAL CHARACTERS HAVING BAD SEX NOT ABOUT BADLY WRITTEN SEX
SO MUCH NSF BUT IF I DON'T OPEN ANY VIDEO MY THINK I'M JUST WASTING TIME AGAIN READING PUNS

THIS IS MAYBE THE FUNNIEST THREAD I'VE EVER READ ON REDDIN
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT HOW ARE WE RATING SCENES THAT ARE SO BAD THEY'RE GOOD OR SO BAD THEY'RE HILARIOUS
IT IS ONE OF MY LIFE GOALS TO WIN THIS AWARD
I DIDN'T THINK WAS THAT TERRIBLE JUST CHEESY
SO HOW DO THEY HANDLE SATIRE
HE THE MOUNT EVEREST ONE IS AT LEAST CREATIVE
DID CHEKAN BHAGAT NOT APPLY FOR THIS
NO MENTION OF FAT PINK MAST
CONTENDERS IN QUOTES
AMP S BOOKS NOV
POINTS FOR CREATIVITY AT LEAST
TWILIGHT ANYBODY
I'D LIKE A TOP BAD SEX IN GAMES AWARD KILOWARE WOULD HAVE A FIELD DAY
I'M KIND OF DISAPPOINTED AT THE LACK OF THE SQUID SCENE IN THE SYMPATHIZER ALTHOUGH IT BEING BAD WAS KIND OF THE POINT
I HOPE TO BE ON THIS LIST SOMEDAY IT WOULD BE AN HONOUR JUST TO BE NOMINATED
A GROANING TO REMEMBER
PORN IS PRETTY ACCURATE
YOU'RE NO LONGER MY NUMBER

WHEN I HAVE SEX AND RUB NIPPLES I ACT JUST LIKE THAT MANUAL HE HAS TOTAL CONCENTRATION
CTRL F TINGLE
AS A PERSON WHO READS A LOT OF MODERN LITERATURE I ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT ALL BIG LITERATURE PRIZES OF NOWADAYS LIKE NOBEL OR PULITZER ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE REAL THING THE MOST AWKWARD SEX SCENE PRIZE I IMAGINED TITANS OF LITERATURE MEETING UP SOMEWHERE IN LUXURY CLUBS AND HOTEL ROOMS EVERY YEAR AND GIVING OUT THE PRIZE IN SECRET AND MASS IS THE ONLY THING THAT IS TRULY PRESTIGIOUS IN THE WORLD OF LITERATURE
TOTALLY READ THE WEB ADDRESS AS ELECTRA LITERATURE I THINK I JUST DEVELOPED A NEW GENRE OF LITERATURE LITERATURE
I READ THE TITLE AS BAD SEX INFECTION WTF IS WRONG WITH ME
SO WHICH GAME OF THRONES NOVEL WINS THIS YEAR
LOL THIS SHIT IS HILARIOUS
WORST
YOU CAN MAP NEARLY ANY STORY TO STORIES FOUND IN THE BIBLE THIS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES IN THE BIBLE

HOWEVER TZOLKIN DID NOT DO THIS IN THE CASE OF THE HOBBIT OR LOAR

I CORDIALLY DISLIKE ALLEGORY IN ALL ITS MANIFESTATIONS AND ALWAYS HAVE DONE SO SINCE I GREW OLD AND WARY ENOUGH TO DETECT ITS PRESENCE I MUCH PREFER HISTORY TRUE OR FEIGNED WITH ITS VARIED APPLICABILITY TO THE THOUGHT AND EXPERIENCE OF READERS I THINK THAT MANY CONFUSE APPLICABILITY WITH ALLEGORY BUT THE ONE RESIDES IN THE FREEDOM OF THE READER AND THE OTHER IN THE PURPOSED DOMINATION OF THE AUTHOR


J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING
BILBOES
MOSES NEVER MAKES IT TO THE PROMISE LAND BILBO DOES AND MANY IF HIS FOLLOWERS DON'T

BILBO WAS TAKING PEOPLEVWHO WERE DIFFERENT AND IT WASN'T HIS LAND

OFTEN HE WASN'T REALLY THE LEADER

YOU HAVE THE NUMBER RIVER AND RELUCTANCE VERY THIN
BILBO WAS ALSO RAISED BY ROYALTY BUT WAS LATER EXILED FROM HIS HOMELAND FOR MURDERING A MAN IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN HIS PEOPLE

BILBO ALSO SPOKE WITH A BURNING BUSH AND WAS TOLD BY A DEIFIC FIGURE THAT IT WAS HIS PURPOSE TO LEAD THE DWARVES TO THE LONELY MOUNTAIN

BILBO JOINED FORCES WITH HIS NEPHEW FRODO AND CAST PLAGUES UPON THE DWARVES TASKMASTERS

BILBO AND THE DWARVES WERE ULTIMATELY DRIVEN FROM THE LAND OF THEIR OPPRESSION AND THEN LATER PURSUED BY THE MILITARY

ACTUALLY THE MORE I READ INTO THIS THE LESS SYMBOLIC IT SEEMS

TZOLKIN WAS UNDOUBTEDLY INFLUENCED BY MYTHOLOGY HISTORY BUT ASIDE FROM THE MOST CURSORY SIMILARITIES I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH YOUR ASSERTION

ALSO APOLOGIES IF I SOUND LIKE AN ASS IT IS NOT MY INTENT TO BE ONE
WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING IS
CONFIRMATION BIAS IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY CONVINCING TO PEOPLE AWARE OF IT HENCE ALL THESE COMMENTS TO AVOID THIS IN THE FUTURE STOP LOOKING FOR THINGS THAT CONFIRM YOUR THEORY INSTEAD THINGS THAT DEFEAT IT
FACEPALM NOPE THAT'S JUST TRYING TOO HARD

MOSES CROSSED A SEA ALSO BILBO ISN'T REALLY THE LEADER AT ALL HE ISN'T EVEN 2ND IN COMMAND 3RD IT'S THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL NOT
BILBO DIDN'T LEAD THE GROUP HE WAS VERY MUCH A CHILD IN THE BEGINNING DESPITE HIS AGE HE NEEDED TO BE RESCUED WAS TOTALLY RELIANT ON OTHERS TO THE POINT OF FORGETTING A HAT AND HANKIE

WHEN HE GAINED THE RING AND MET GOLLUM HE STARTED TO GROW UP HE THOUGHT FOR HIMSELF GOT HIMSELF OUT OF TROUBLE LATER HE WAS ABLE TO AID HIS FRIENDS EVENTUALLY EVEN SAVING THEM FROM SPIDERS AND ELVES AT THE END HE EVEN GOES AGAINST HIS FRIENDS BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF EVERYONE WHILE THIS LED TO A NEAR IRREPARABLE BREACH HE WAS ALSO ADULT ENOUGH TO FORGIVE AND FORGET AS WAS THORIN

BY THE TIME BILBO WAS MAKING PLANS THE DWARVES DEFINITELY TRUSTED HIM EVEN THEN HE WASN'T LEADING THEIR DISTRUST OF HIM WAS ONLY AT THE BEGINNING AND WAS DUE TO DOUBTS OF HIS ABILITY NOT HIS HONESTY OR MOTIVES DIDN'T THE JEWS DISTRUST MOSES BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN RAISED BY WITH THE PHARAOH KILLING AN OVERSEER NOT BEING ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM ONE OF THEM I'M WEAK ON OLD TESTAMENT KNOWLEDGE SO I COULD BE WRONG HERE

ALSO WHICH RIVER ARE YOU REFERRING TO IN HOBBIT AS I RECALL THERE WERE SEVERAL RIVERS AND THE LAKE BUT NONE OF THEM REALLY HAD THE SAME SIGNIFICANCE AS MOSES PARTING THE SEA
SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A STRETCH I MEAN MOSES DIDN'T EVEN CROSS A RIVER HE CROSSED A SEA AND WHAT STORY DOESN'T INVOLVE PEOPLE CROSSING A RIVER SEEMS MORE LIKE A EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF CONFIRMATION BIAS
YOU REALIZE THAT THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY STORY STRUCTURES AND THE JOURNEY IS ONE OF THEM
READ BEOWULF IT'LL BECOME CLEARER THEN
ITT LOAR WAS AND WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN THEMED SERIES PROCLAIMED BOTH WAYS BY TZOLKIN ONE ASSERTION CITED ONE NOT
WHILE THERE IS CHRISTIAN SYMBOLISM IN THE HOBBIT AND LORD OF THE RINGS ITS INCIDENTAL JNR TZOLKIN SAID ONCE OR TWICE THAT LORD OF THE RINGS IS NOT BASED ON CHRISTIANITY IN ANY WAY
AND SPEAKING OF TZOLKIN HAS ANYONE ELSE NOTICED THE PARALLELS BETWEEN THE LORD OF THE RINGS AND H ROYAL PUFNSTUF

NOT A JOKE OLDER REDDITORS BACK ME UP
THIN AT BEST AND IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO WHAT TZOLKIN HIMSELF HAS SAID ABOUT ALLEGORY
BILBO DID NOT LEAD THIRTEEN GROUPS IN FACT HE DID NOT LEAD THIRTEEN DWARVES EITHER THE SIMILARITIES ARE VERY VERY FORCED
WHAT'S REALLY IRONIC ODD WHATEVER IS THAT TZOLKIN INTENTIONALLY WROTE THE HOBBIT AND THE LORD OF THE RINGS WITH ZERO RELIGIOUS OVERTONES SUBTEXT INTENT AS A RESPONSE TO THE WORKS OF COUNTY SOUTH LEWIS
I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THE RING AS NUCLEAR POWER AND THE MEN OF THE WEST VERB SARON WAS LIKE A PARALLEL TO WORLD WAR 2
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF PARALLELISATION USING THIS MODEL OF MEANING
SYMBOLOGY
I'D ARGUE IF ANYTHING THE GREATER MEANING IS THE DANGER OF MATERIALISM WHILE ENCOURAGING THE PRESERVATION OF HERITAGE WE SEE MULTIPLE ANTAGONISTS THAT ARE DEFINED AS EVIL THROUGH THEIR GREED FOR WEALTH POWER AND CHARACTERS THAT ARE CORRUPTED BY THEIR MATERIALISM PRECIOUS

THERE ARE ALSO A GREAT MANY ARTICLES WRITTEN SAYING THAT ANOTHER MAJOR SYMBOL IN THAT UNIVERSE IS THE BATTLE BETWEEN TECH AND NATURE REPRESENTED BY THE STRIP MINING WARLIKE FORCES OF THE SOUTH VS THE FORCES OF GOOD TYPICALLY REPRESENTED WITH THEIR INHERIT GOODNESS BEING RELATIVE TO THEIR CONNECTION WITH NATURE

IT WAS LARGELY SEEN AS REACTIONARY AND A CONTINUATION OF THE LOST GENERATION WHO WERE GRAPPLING WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF MASS PRODUCTION INDUSTRIALIZATION AND ADVANCEMENTS IN WAR TECH SEEN IN WWI II

WHILE THAT ALONE DOESN'T REFUTE THIS BEING LINKED TO RELIGION I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE ALMOST COMPLETE LACK OF MENTION OF RELIGION IN THE TEXTS MIGHT INDICATE SOME STANCE THAT RELIGION SHOULD BE LEFT OUT OF THE INTERPRETATION

TL R IT'S ABOUT THE DANGER OF GREED AND TECH
FOR ONE BILBO WASN'T THE LEADER OF THE GROUP HE WAS IN HE JUST HAPPENED TO BE THE PROTAGONIST OF THE STORY FOR MOST OF THE STORY HE IS THE UNDERESTIMATED TAGALONG AS HE STUMBLES INTO AND OUT OF A LOT OF HIS DELIVERANCE FROM HARM MOMENTS

AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THE BIBLE USES SO MANY CLASSIC NARRATIVE STRUCTURES THAT YOU CAN DRAW PARALLELS BETWEEN IT AND PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER WORK OF FICTION
YEAH AND PINK FLOYD AND THE WIZARD OF OZ OR SOMETHING

FUNNY TIMING I LITERALLY YES LITERALLY READ THE FOREWORD TO LOAR LAST NIGHT AND WAS QUITE TAKEN BY TOLKIENS SWEEPING DISMISSAL OF ANY KIND OF SYMBOLISM IN HIS BOOKS
I THINK IF ANYTHING IT WAS INFLUENCED MUCH MORE BY HIS OBSESSION WITH ANCIENT EPICS LIKE BEOWULF AND GERMANIC MYTHOLOGY IN GENERAL THE NAMES OF ALL THE DWARVES AND GANDALF ARE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE VOLUSPA THE MOST IMPORTANT TEXT IN THE ANCIENT NORSE RELIGION GANDALF IS MUCH MORE OF AN ODIN THAN BILBO IS A MOSES OR ANY OTHER BIBLICAL CHARACTER
SHIT PEOPLE ARE STRIPPING THE NUANCE FROM YOUR POST LIKE WINTER DOES TO LEAVES FROM A TREE

I THINK THIS HAS MERIT J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN WAS A DEVOUT ROMAN CATHOLIC AND WAS VERY VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE YOUR OBSERVATION IS TOTALLY MERITORIOUS AND MAYBE EVEN POSSIBLE

KUDOS BROTHER I LIKE THIS ONE
ALSO THE BATTLE WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE PROMISED LAND WHO ARE RELATIVELY GIANT
TZOLKIN SAID THE LORD OF THE RINGS WAS A FUNDAMENTALLY RELIGIOUS AND CATHOLIC WORK YOU'VE FOUND THE KEY DEAR BOY BRAVO
I LOVE BOTH THE FILM AND THE BOOK BUT TO ME THEY RE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STORIES THE MOVIE IS MORE OF AN ACCOMPLISHMENT IN STORYTELLING WHILE THE BOOK REALLY SUCCEEDS IN DELVING DEEP INTO AN ALIEN NOT SO ALIEN STATE OF MIND THE WHOLE STORY OF HER MUTILATION HER DEALING WITH IT EVERYDAY THE ALIEN PERSPECTIVE OF AN ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST ALL OF THESE ARE SO BRILLIANTLY EXPLORED I LOVE THIS BOOK
I KNOW THAT SLADE HOUSE BY DAVID MITCHELL STARTED AS A SHORT STORY THAT WAS DONE THROUGH TWITTER HE EVENTUALLY EXPANDED THE STORY AND WROTE A DAMN GOOD BOOK
THE CELLAR BY NATASHA PRESTON ORIGINATED ON WATTPAD AND MANAGED TO BE PUBLISHED ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T VERY GOOD I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PUBLISHED AUTHORS ON WATTPAD AS WELL
TEJU COLE PUBLISHED A STORY THROUGH TWITTER NOTABLY BY RETWEETING WITH COLLABORATORS
I STILL THINK THERE'S VALUE IN HAVING A TERM TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN LARGE SIZED OFTEN SELF-CONTAINED AND COMPLETED STORIES AND THE THIN NEVER-ENDING MONTHLY FLOPPIES THAT TRADITIONALLY DOMINATED SUPERHERO COMICS

I AGREE THAT WE SHOULD BE PAST THE POINT OF BEING EMBARRASSED ABOUT EMBRACING THE WORD COMICS AND IT CAN BE A GREAT CATCH-ALL TO COVER THE MEDIUM FROM NEWSPAPER COMIC STRIPS TO FLOPPIES TO INTERNET COMICS TO SERIOUS AND HEAVY WHOLE NOVELS TOLD IN COMIC FORM

THAT BEING SAID IT'S STILL USEFUL TO HAVE A VOCABULARY TO TALK ABOUT AND DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THOSE TYPES HOW EVER MUCH THE LINE MAY BE BLURRED TODAY

EDIT JUST THOUGHT OF A GOOD ANALOGUE IT'S LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TV AND MOVIES YEAH THEY'RE BOTH BUT WE STILL DIFFERENTIATE
I ALWAYS REFERRED TO SINGLE ISSUES AS COMIC'S AND THE COLLECTIONS AS GRAPHIC NOVELS I LIKED THE DISTINCTION
EXCEPT THERE ARE SOME BOOKS THAT ARE PUBLISHED AS A COMPLETE SELF-CONTAINED BOOK RATHER THAN AS INDIVIDUAL ISSUES PAUL THE DARK KNIGHT A TRUE BATMAN STORY AND MARIJANE PERSEPOLIS BOOKS SPRING TO MIND THEY'RE COMPARATIVELY RARE VERSUS BOOKS COLLECTED FROM SINGLE ISSUES BUT THE TERM GRAPHIC NOVEL IS PROBABLY THE BEST ONE FOR BOOKS LIKE THAT
HEH READING THAT MAKES ME WANT TO CALL THEM GRAPHIC NOVELS EVEN MORE
THIS IS KIND OF CRINGE YEAH YOU BEAT THAT STRAW MANUAL GREAT JOB THE DEBATE OF GRAPHIC NOVEL VS COMIC SEEMS TO BE QUITE THE ODD THING TO BE BE SO IMPASSIONED ABOUT BUT HEY I CAN GO ON FOR HOURS ABOUT MAGIC THE GATHERING SO CONGRATS TO THIS GUY HE'S MADE IT TO THE POINT WHERE HE GETS PAID PRESUMABLY TO RANT ABOUT TOPICS THAT DON'T REALLY MATTER
SUCCESSFUL ARTISTS OFTEN USE A TERM AS A BADGE OF HONOUR NEIL CAIMAN AND OTHERS ARE QUOTED IN THIS ARTICLE TELLING US THEY ARE HAPPY WITH THE TERM COMICS FINE THE IMPRESSIONISTS WERE HAPPY TO TAKE ON A NAME THAT HAD BEEN USED TO CITICISM THEM

BUT THE WORD COMICS COVERS SUCH A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIAL WHY SHOULD I GIVE THE SAME NAME TO A STRIP AS TO A HIGHLY STRUCTURED FICTION OVER HUNDREDS OF PAGES THEY ARE AS DIFFERENT AS A HAIKU AND A NOVEL

IF I TELL PEOPLE I LOVE CALVIN AND HOBBES THEY KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I TELL PEOPLE I LOVE A WORK LIKE V FOR VENDETTA THEY KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I TELL THEM I LOVE COMICS IT MEANS NOTHING AND YES I DO KNOW THAT BILL WATTERSON IS AS INTERESTING AN AUTHOR AS ALAN MOORE BUT DIFFERENT
I AGREE I DO THINK IT'S HELPFUL IN DETERMINING IF SOMETHING IS A COLLECTED TRADE VS A FLOPPY BUT I HEAR THIS IT'S FRUSTRATING AS HELL
THE ARTICLE DERIDES TERMS LIKE SEQUENTIAL ART AND GRAPHIC NOVELS BECAUSE THEY'RE BORROWED TERMINOLOGY BUT DIDN'T THE WORD COMICS COME FROM COMIC STRIPS
GRAPHIC NOVEL JUST SOUNDS MORE PROFESSIONAL DON'T GET ME WRONG I GET YOUR POINT I JUST THINK THAT THE TWO TERMS STILL DEFINE DIFFERENT THINGS IN PEOPLES MINDS THERE'S NO NEED TO BE OFFENDED THAT SOMEONE CALLED YOUR COMIC A GRAPHIC NOVEL
BULLSHIT
WE NEVER DID I COLLECT COMIC BOOKS I DON'T NEED THAT TO SOUND MANLY OR SOPHISTICATED
THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN SELF-CONTAINED WORKS OF LITERARY AND GRAPHIC ARTISTRY LIKE FUN HOME MAUS AND BLANKETS AND SERIAL JUVENILIA LIKE BLACK PANTHER AND JUDGE DREDD WHATEVER THE PREFERRED TERMINOLOGY IS THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE THAN ONE CATEGORY
FOR ME ITS NOT CONTENT BUT STRUCTURE THAT REQUIRES A DIFFERENT LABEL GRAPHIC NOVELS ARE FULL STORIES COLLECTED IN A VOLUME COMICS ARE COMMONLY MONTHLY MAGAZINES GRAPHIC NOVELS CAN BE BUILT FROM COMICS AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH TRADE PAPERBACKS OR CAN BE ADAPTIONS FROM LITERATURE OR NEW STORIES THEMSELVES
DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN FINALLY CUT THROUGH ALL THE CHAFF AND JUST CALL MANGAS JAPANESE COMICS GODS KNOW HOW MUCH I DETEST THE WAY PEOPLE PRONOUNCE IT MAWNGUH DUUUUGH
THAT POMPOUS PHRASE GRAPHIC NOVEL WAS THOUGHT UP BY SOME IDIOT IN THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT OF DC I PREFER TO CALL THEM BIG EXPENSIVE COMICS
ALAN MOORE
I'M THINKING ASAPHIC GROVEL
THERE ARE WAY MORE STORIES THAT ARE PUBLISHED AS SINGLE ISSUES FIRST RUN AND COLLECTED LATER IT REALLY GRINDS MY GEARS TO CALL THAT A GRAPHIC NOVEL GET WITH IT WALKING DEAD THE SHOW ISN'T BASED ON THE SERIES OF GRAPHIC NOVELS IT IS A MONTHLY COMIC BOOK
ALAN MOORE SAID HE DIDN'T LIKE THE EXPRESSION GRAPHIC NOVEL AND ALWAYS USED COMIC AS HE SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING APOLOGETIC ABOUT TRYING TO CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE
SOUNDS GOOD MIGHT GIVE IT A GO OVER THE SUMMER
I'M A HOARDER BUT IT KIND OF WORKS FOR ME

I'LL JUST BUY A TITLE IF IT SOUNDS REMOTELY CLOSE TO SOMETHING I'D ENJOY AND THEN I'LL MOST LIKELY FORGET ABOUT IT FOR YEARS UNLESS I EXPLICITLY MAKE A POINT OUT OF IT TO READ THE BOOK KINDA HOW I JUST ORDERED DON QUINTE AND I PLAN TO READ IT ONCE IT ARRIVES ANYHOW IT HAPPENS THAT SOMETIMES I GET BURNT OUT HAVING READ SINCE I BASICALLY COULD THAT HAPPENS OFTEN I'LL GIVE IT THE PERIOD AND THEN I'LL JUST PICK UP SOMETHING RANDOM A NOVEL A BOOK ON ROMAN HISTORY SOME EASY PHILOSOPHY SOME FANCY TITLE ON CULTURE OR CIVILIZATION SOME PSYCHOLOGY FOR UNIVERSITY AND THEN I'LL FEEL THE RAGING PASSION AGAIN HAVING A COLLECTION WITH VARIETY HELPS BUT THAT ALSO MIGHT JUST BE MY UNCONSCIOUS JUSTIFICATION FOR SPENDING ON A BOOK ON TEA CEREMONIES THAT I HAVEN'T FINISHED
I'M PRETTY MUCH A HOARDER NOT IN THE SENSE THAT SCARF UP EVERY BOOK I SEE BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME LETTING GO ANY BOOK THAT I READ AND ENJOYED MY SHELVES ARE FILLED TO OVERFLOWING
TO ME HAVING READ A BOOK IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN OWNING IT
I'D SAY A COLLECTOR THERE ARE MANY BOOKS I WILL HOLD ONTO BUT OTHER BOOKS I'VE BEEN PERFECTLY FINE WITH NOT KEEPING IN MY COLLECTION BECAUSE OF ONE REASON OR ANOTHER
HOARDER I CAN'T WALK OUT OF A BOOKSTORE WITH FEWER THAN NEW BOOKS THAT I'LL PROBABLY NEVER GET AROUND TO READING IT'S AN ADDICTION
MY ROOM DEFINITELY WOULD LEAD ONE TO BELIEVE THAT I AM A BOOK HOARDER I BUY A LOT OF USED BOOKS IN THRIFT SHOPS I CAN'T READ AT A PACE TO KEEP UP AND I HAVE
NOT SOLD ANY YET I AM WILLING TO GET RID OF BOOKS I WON'T CONSIDER READING AGAIN
DELETED
A LITTLE OF BOTH
KIND OF BOTH I'M FINE WITH GETTING RID OF CERTAIN BOOKS FOR EXAMPLE MY WHOLE BAILEY SCHOOL KIDS COLLECTION WENT BYE BYE BUT FOR THE MOST PART I DO SAVE A LOT OF MY BOOKS THE REASON I DON'T FEEL SUPER GUILTY ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE I'VE BECOME A PRETTY SMART BUYER I'LL LOOK AT REVIEWS FIRST AND I'LL TEST A NEW BOOK OUT FROM THE LIBRARY FIRST OFTEN TIMES THEN IF I STILL LOVE IT I'LL BUY IT THE ONLY BOOKS I BUY WITHOUT HESITATION ARE BOOKS IN SERIES I READ OR AUTHORS SUCH AS LIANE MORIARTY WHO I AM A DIEHARD FAN OF
A BIT OF BOTH THERE ARE MANY THAT ARE IN MY PERMANENT COLLECTION BUT I DON'T LIKE TO GET RID OF ANY BOOKS UNTIL I HAVE TO PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE I REREAD ALMOST EVERYTHING A COUPLE OF TIMES

EACH TIME I MOVE I TEND TO DO A PRETTY SERIOUS BOOK PURGE
HMM BOTH I DON'T HAVE MANY FROM WAY BACK WHEN AND I ONLY TEND TO HANG ON TO I MIGHT READ AGAIN OR REALLY GOOD FICTION BOOKS MOST I GIVE AWAY AFTER BUT DAMN I LOVE FINDING GOOD BOOKS NEARLY EVERYTHING IS AT LEAST A LITTLE INTERESTING AND WHEN I'M STRESSED I GO TO A BOOK STORE LIKE SOME PEOPLE GO TO BARS SO THEY TEND TO ACCUMULATE FASTER THAN I CAN READ THEM FOR YEARS BUT THEY ARE WELL ORGANIZED ON FLOOR TO CEILING SHELVES SORT OF ROUGHLY IN CATEGORY SO I DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS AS HOARDING
I'M MODEST AND FRUGAL AS IT IS WITH MOST THINGS SO I GO A TAD OVER BOARD WITH BOOKS I READ EVERYTHING I BUY EVENTUALLY BUT IM ALSO THE SON OF A GRAPHIC DESIGNER AND MUSICIAN SO THE LATENT ARTIST SIDE OF ME LOVES COVER ARTICLE OCCASIONAL I'LL EVEN BUY BOOKS I ALREADY OWN IF ITS GOT A FANCY COVER OR COMES BUNDLED WITH ONES I HAVEN'T PURCHASED THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE SOME FROM MY CHILDHOOD THAT I WILL MOST LIKELY DISCARD
I'M AT BIT OF BOTH I DID HOWEVER CREATE A HOME LIBRARY LAST YEAR SO I THINK IT'S OKAY HAHA
I WAS A BOOK COLLECTOR HAD AN ENTIRE WALL COVERED WITH BOOK SHELVES MADE FOR MY BIRTHDAY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND THEN I PAINSTAKINGLY COLLECTED BOOKS THAT HAD EMOTIONAL VALUE FOR ME OF COURSE I THEN MOVED BAG BAGGAGE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR WORK AND HAVE NO INTENTION OF GOING BACK SO MY ROOM IS SANS BOOKS NOW
NOW I JUST HAVE TONS OF BOOKS ON MY KINDLE BECAUSE IM A MOOD READER SO ON KINDLE I CALL IT HOARDING BOOKS NOT COLLECTING IT DOESN'T GIVE ME THE SAME PLEASURE
USED TO BE I WOULD GO INTO THRIFT STORES JUST CLEAR OUT THEIR BOOK SECTIONS I ACTUALLY READ MAYBE OF THEM BUT IT'S HOW I DISCOVERED SOME GREAT BOOKS INCLUDING HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY

I'VE SINCE GONE DIGITAL AND DONATED OR RESOLD MOST OF THEM BUT I NOW HAVE OVER A IN MY CLOUD DRIVE SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I'M STILL A BOOK HOARDER
I USED TO BE A LITTLE OF BOTH I LUGGED BOXES OF BOOKS FROM STATE TO STATE I NOW LIVE IN A VERY SMALL CONDO DECIDED TO DONATE EVERY ONE INCLUDING MY VAST COLLECTION OF COOKBOOKS SOME OF WHICH I NEVER OPENED
I WAS A HOARDER UNTIL I MOVED TO A VERY HUMID PLACE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY SHIPPING MY BOOKS THERE ONLY TO SEE THEM GO MOLDY NOW I HOARD ON MY KINDLE
I'M A BIT OF A HOARDER I BUY FASTER THAN I READ BUT I DO READ THEM AND IN MOST CASES I SEND THEM ON TO SOMEONE ELSE BETWEEN PRINT AND ELECTRONIC I HAVE ABOUT BOOKS THAT I OWN BUT HAVEN'T READ
I'VE BEEN A BOOK HOARDER MOST OF MY LIFE BUT BEING SEPARATED FROM MY HOARD AND READING EXCLUSIVELY ON MY KINDLE I THINK I'VE BECOME A COLLECTOR

MY PROBLEM IS THAT IN ADDITION TO LOVING READING I REALLY LOVE HAVING BOOKS AROUND I'M FULLY CONVERTED TO THE KINDLE FOR READING AND DON'T THINK I'LL EVER GO FULLY BACK TO HARD COPIES BUT I STILL LOVE FULL BOOKSHELVES WHEN I GET HOME NEXT FALL I PLAN ON SERIOUSLY CULLING MY LIBRARY WHICH HAS BEEN ACCUMULATING SINCE I WAS A KID AND THEN SLOWLY BUILDING IT BACK UP GOING FORWARD I WANT TO PUT MY MONEY INTO NICE EDITIONS OR COLLECTIONS OF BOOKS I LOVE INSTEAD OF BUYING PHYSICAL COPIES OF EVERYTHING I READ
COLLECTING MY BOOK SPENDING IS WITHIN MY MEANS I CAN PART WITH BOOKS THEY FEATURE IN MY HOME BUT HAVEN'T TAKEN OVER I DON'T VALUE THEM ABOVE THE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE I'M GOOD
COMBINATION OF BOTH
I USED TO HOARD BOOKS UNTIL I REALISED I WAS IMPULSE BUYING AND WASTING MONEY NOW I READ IT ON KINDLE FIRST AND THEN IF I'VE ENJOYED IT THAT MUCH I BUY A GOOD QUALITY HARDBACK WITH A NICE COVER FOR MY SHELF IT'S ONLY A BIT LESS EXPENSIVE THIS WAY BUT I'VE GOT A SHELF FULL OF BEAUTIFUL BOOKS ALL OF WHICH I'VE READ AND REALLY ENJOYED AND NO WASTAGE AT LEAST THIS WAY IF I FIND THAT A BOOK WASN'T THAT GOOD IT'S NOT TAKING UP SPACE AND I'M NOT LEFT WITH LOADS OF LOW QUALITY PAPERBACKS ON MY SHELVES
NEITHER I'M POSTING BECAUSE I LOVE READING BUT IT SEEMS SO COMMON FOR OTHERS WHO READ TO THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO SAY YOU LOVE BOOKS UNTIL YOU HAVE A HUGE COLLECTION

I ONLY HAVE A COLLECTION OF MY BELOVED NATURE FIELD GUIDES AND SOME NATURE LIT BOOKS BECAUSE I USE REFERENCE THEM CONSTANTLY BUT I DON'T KEEP BOOKS THIS YEAR I HAD A LONG STINT OF HOMELESSNESS AND NOW WORK WITH BOOKS AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OBSESSED WITH MY LOCAL LIBRARY SYSTEM THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH NEED TO KEEP BOOKS AROUND AND FOR A WHILE I REALLY COULDN'T

PLUS I'VE SEEN THAT COPIES OF BOOKS REALLY LACK VALUE IN MY JOB I'VE TOSSED A LOT OF BOOKS SEEMS THE PRICES ARE REALLY JACKED UP COMPARED TO WHAT'S DONE WITH THEM WHEN THEY AREN'T WANTED I'D RATHER BORROW I ALSO PASS ALONG BOOKS THAT I BUY FOR OTHERS TO READ BECAUSE I LIKE TO SHARE THEM AND EVEN THEN PEOPLE DON'T GET THE IDEA OF READING IT AND PASSING IT ALONG
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL MYSELF COLLECTOR OR HOARDER I HAVE CLOSE TO BOOKS IN MY HOUSE AND I'VE READ PROBABLY OF THEM BUT FOR FULL DISCLOSURE I HAVE MULTIPLE COPIES OF SOME TITLES AND I KEEP HAVING TO BUY MORE BOOKSHELVES TO PLACE THEM ON YET I LOVE GIVING BOOKS TO PEOPLE AND I BUY THESE MULTIPLE COPIES BECAUSE I LIKE THE BOOKS AND WANT OTHERS TO SHARE MY ENJOYMENT I SET ASIDE LITTLE PILES OF BOOKS FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR TASTES AND PERSONALITIES THEN WHEN I VISIT I CAN SURPRISE THEM WITH A STACK OF GOOD READING MATERIALS
A COLLECTOR PARTIALLY DUE TO SPACE RESTRICTIONS AND PARTIALLY BECAUSE I'M VERY CHOOSY WITH WHAT I LOOK FOR

I HAVE TO RESIST THE MINDSET TO PURCHASE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF A TITLE IN THE VERY RARE EVENT I DO SO IT'S LIKELY BECAUSE I FOUND A HARDCOVER MATTE COPY FOUND IT SIGNED OR FOUND ONE IN BETTER CONDITION

I CONTINUALLY GO THROUGH MY BOOKCASES USUALLY ONCE A MONTH AND TAKE OUT ANYTHING THAT I'VE EITHER READ AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN OR HAVE REPLACED WITH A BETTER CLEANER VERSION

BUYING NEW BOOKS I'M LIKELY NEVER GOING TO READ IS A BIG MOTIVATOR TO GO CHEAP AND I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE IN THAT THE MAJORITY OF MY LIBRARY WHICH HAS INCLUDED SIGNED FIRST EDITIONS WAS MOSTLY PURCHASED FOR OR LESS EACH AT THRIFT STORES THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS I MAKE TO THIS RULE ARE THE PENGUIN CLASSICS DELUXE EDITIONS WHICH I WILL USUALLY PURCHASE AT A CHAPTERS IF I HAVE A GIFT CARD OR A SIGNED COPY OF A BOOK LIKE NATHAN MY YEAR OF FLOPS OR A MARGARET ATWOOD TITLE IF I DON'T THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO FIND IT ANYWHERE OR I'M SEEING THE AUTHOR SPEAK

IF I BUY SOMETHING IT'S WITH THE INTENT THAT I'M GOING TO READ IT WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS IF NOT IT EITHER GOES IN A STORAGE PILE OR GETS SENT BACK TO THE THRIFT STORE
CAT'S CRADLE IS MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME

YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FUN WITH IT
I LOVE SLAUGHTER HOUSE SO MUCH ITS THE ONLY BOOK I HAVE READ WHERE NON LINEAR NARRATIVE THAT SOME AUTHORS LIKE TO USE WORKS IN MY OPINION AND X CHARACTER NEVER MET Y CHARACTER EVER AGAIN PAGES LATER ONE OF THEM DIES STEPHEN KING PARTICULARLY ANGERS ME FOR DOING THIS

MY FAVORITES BY VONNEGUT ARE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE
BLUEBEARD
HOCUS POCUS
BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS
WELCOME TO THE MONKEY HOUSE

NOTE VONNEGUT CAN BE SILLY HE CAN BE EXPERIMENTAL AND HE CAN ALSO BE SERIOUS I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE SILLY SIDE OF VONNEGUT SO MY SELECTION IS IN FAVOUR OR HIS EITHER MORE SERIOUS WORK OR HIS MORE SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENTS

I JUST FINISHED CATS CRADLE THAT MAN KNOWS HOW TO KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES
ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITES BY VONNEGUT IS GALAPAGOS AND GOD BLESS YOU MR ROSEWATER ISN'T BAD EITHER
I HAVEN'T READ SIRENS OF TITAN YET BUT CAT'S CRADLE AND MOTHER NIGHT ARE BOTH SERIOUSLY GREAT I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY THEM
SIRENS OF TITAN IS MY FAVOURITE VONNEGUT
I'M GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT DON'T FORGET ABOUT YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY TOO IF YOU LIKE READING BOOKS FOR FREE
I'VE GOTTEN INTO HIM RECENTLY TOO SO FAR READ SLAUGHTER HOUSE BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS AND CURRENTLY GIRONS OF TITAN REALLY ENJOYING HIS WRITING SO FAR TOO
SLAUGHTERHOUSE WAS MADE INTO A FAIRLY DECENT MOVIE FUNNY AND POIGNANT BTW ENJOY CAT'S CRADLE IT'S HILARIOUS
CAT'S CRADLE AND BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATIONS IF YOU LIKED
SO IT GOES
CAT'S CRADLE IS MY FAVE
BECOMES AN ADDICTION
THE SIRENS OF TITAN WAS GREAT
SIRENS OF TITAN IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVE VONNEGUT FOR ME IT'S THE MOST LIKE A NORMAL NOVEL THE TIMELINE ISN'T AS FRAGMENTED AS USUAL AND CONCEPTUALLY IT'S JUST LIKE WAAAAAAAH AND IT'S MORE SCIENCE FICTION THAN OTHERS OF HIS I'VE READ AND I THINK IT HOLDS MERIT BEING ONE OF HIS EARLIER BOOKS MOTHER NIGHT HAD ME SHOUTING OUT LOUD IN PUBLIC OH OH OH AND HOCUS POCUS BUT OF ALL OF THEM SIRENS IS MY TOTAL BEST
YOU'RE IN FOR A TREAT VONNEGUT IS WONDERFUL GOOD CALL ON SIRENS OF TITAN CAT'S CRADLE AND MOTHER NIGHT MOTHER NIGHT IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE WITH CAT'S CRADLE COMING IN A CLOSE SECOND AND SIRENS OF TITAN WAS THE FIRST NOVEL OF HIS I READ SO IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART
I'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH HIS NOVELS CHRONOLOGICALLY AND LOVE EACH FOR DIFFERENT REASONS IF YOU'RE WANTING TO GET A LOT OF HIS BOOKS THE LIBRARY OF AMERICA HAS ALL HIS WORKS COLLECTED INTO FOUR VOLUMES
I HAVEN'T SEEN HARBISON BERGERON MENTIONED ITS QUITE POSSIBLY MY FAVORITE SHORT STORY YOU CAN FIND IT IN HIS WELCOME TO THE MONKEYHOUSE SHORT STORY COLLECTION
UGHHH SLAUGHTER HOUSE HIT ME HARD DRAWS ATTENTION TO A LITTLE PUBLICIZED ALLIED ATROCITY DURING WW2 TO BOOT SIRENS OF TITAN IS SUPER AWESOME TOO NOW I REALIZE I NEED TO REREAD SIRENS
I VERY RARELY BUY BRAND NEW A THEY ARE EXPENSIVE WHEN BRAND NEW AND B THEY ARE SO NEW AND UNBLEMISHED I FEEL BAD WHEN I INEVITABLY DOGEAR OR ACCIDENTLY SPLATTER BATHWATER ON A PAGE
I PREFER SPARKLY NEW BOOKS BUT USED BOOKS ARE CHEAP
I BUY USED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BUT NOT FOR ANY ROMANTIC PURPOSES IT'S JUST PRACTICAL FOR THE NUMBER OF BOOKS I COLLECT AND CONSUME I FREQUENT LIBRARY BOOK SALES TOO AND I'VE BEEN REALLY LUCKY WHEN I GO
EVER SINCE I WAS A KID I'VE READ USED BOOKS BUT I FAR PREFER NEW ONES I LIKED THAT THEY WERENT MUSTY OR YELLOW AND I LIKED KNOWING FOR A FACT THEY WERE CLEAN IN FACT I HAVE A SMALL LIST OF BOOKS I INTEND TO BUY AS A COLLECTION EVENTUALLY IN PHYSICAL FORM OF ALL MY FAVORITES AND EVEN IF I HAVE USED VERSIONS OF THEM NOW I'D PROBABLY WANT TO BUY A NEW SET

DIFFERENT STROKES DIFFERENT BLOKES I SAY
I BUY NEARLY ALL MY BOOKS IN CHARITY SHOPS IT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS TO DO WHEN I HAVE TIME OFF
I LOVE USED BOOKS THEY KIND OF TAKE ON LIFE THAT I GET TO SHARE WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND SINCE I READ SO MUCH IT'S FAR LESS PROHIBITIVE TO GET A HANDFUL OF USED BOOKS RATHER THAN A SINGLE NEW BOOK AT THE SAME PRICE
THERE'S A CERTAIN PIQUANCY EVEN IN THE PLATES OR INSCRIBED NAMES OF PRIOR OWNERS LET ALONE TO MY DARLING JOHN FROM JANE HAPPY BIRTHDAY I CAN DO WITHOUT UNDERLININGS THOUGH
I'M THE OPPOSITE I HAVE TO KEEP MY BOOKS IN THE SAME SHAPE AS WHEN I BOUGHT THEM NEW

THE SPINE PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND THE COVER TO FOLD DOWN WITHOUT IT HANGING UP FROM KEEPING IT BENT BACK FROM CONTINUOUS READ

IT CAN'T JUST BE ME WHO AS THIS WEIRD KEEPING THE BOOKS LOOKING BRAND NEW THING

BUT THE HUGE UP SIDE TO BUYING 2ND HAND IS HOW MUCH CHEAPER THEY ARE
AS READERS WE LOVE TO ESCAPE TO MAGICAL WORLDS WE LOVE A NEW NARRATIVE AND A FRESH STORY THAT APPLIED TO USED BOOKS AS WELL YOU NEVER KNOW THE PATH THAT THE BOOK TOOK TO GET TO YOUR HANDS THERE'S A STORY YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF A CHAR A MAGIC
I BUY MOST OF MY BOOKS BRAND NEW BUT I LOVE SEEING THEM GRADUALLY GET THAT OLD WORN-OUT LOOK AS THE YEARS PASSIVE IT HELPS BUILD A FEELING OF INTIMACY WITH THE BOOK
I DO ENJOY BOOKS THAT LOOK LOVED I JUST PREFER TO BE THE ONE THAT LOVED THEM I REALLY ENJOY STARTING A CLEAN NEW BOOK AND BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE LITTLE BLEMISHES

MY COPY OF CATCH IS REALLY DOGEARED AND I LOVE IT
I ALMOST ALWAYS BUY SECOND-HAND AT THRIFT SHOPS I'VE HAD A LOT OF AMAZING DEALS OVER THE YEARS LAST WEEK I FOUND A FIRST EDITION HARDCOVER OF NORA ROBERTS THE OBSESSION MY GRANDMOTHER WANTED TO READ IT AND A DECENT FEW TEARS BLEMISHES FIRST EDITION OF STEPHEN FIRESTARTER FOR THE TWO AND A STEAL AT THAT PRICE

THERE ARE SIGNED BOOKS I OWN HAVE BOUGHT SECOND-HAND THAT TELL THEIR OWN STORY AND I'M ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY THEM ONE BOOK I BOUGHT OVER THE SUMMER A SIGNED COPY OF AL KING OF KENSINGTON AUTOBIOGRAPHY WAS OWNED AND INSCRIBED TO A WRITER FROM THE CANADIAN QUILL AND QUIRE MAGAZINE AND HAD A NUMBER OF PRESS CLIPPINGS INCLUDING THE MAGAZINE PIECE DONE UP BY THE WRITER AND AN ADVANCE PRESS RELEASE TALKING ABOUT THE BOOK I WOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND THAT INFORMATION ONLINE SO THIS BOOK WAS AN INTERESTING GLIMPSE INTO BOTH WAXMAN AND THE WRITER WHO WROTE THE PIECE ON IT
A BOOK SHOULD BE READ AND THIS SHOULD BE VISIBLE NOTHING FREAKS ME OUT MORE THAN TO SEE A BOOKSHELF WITH NEW BOOKS IN SOMEONE'S HOME HOWEVER ISN'T IT A LOVELY MOMENT WHEN YOU GET A THICK NEW HARDBACK AND YOU BREAK IT IN IT'S A FEELING OF I'M THE FIRST READER OF THIS BOOK
I GET ALOT OF SATISFACTION FROM SEEING MY FAVOURITE BOOKS LOOK WORN OUT ESPECIALLY WHEN I OPEN IT AND IT AUTOMATICALLY OPENS TO MY FAVOURITE CHAPTER ITS ALSO NICE WHEN IT SOMETIMES DOES THAT TO THE USED BOOKS I SOMETIMES BUY INTERESTING TO READ WHAT CHAPTERS WERE ENJOYED BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER THEN AGAIN THAT'S JUST PROBABLY MY OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION HEH
INEXPENSIVE USED BOOKS ARE GREAT TO READ AND EVALUATE WRITERS STORIES BUYING NEW FROM FAVORITE AUTHORS HELPS FILL THEIR POCKETS

MY FUN THESE DAYS IS BUYING NEW COPIES OF MY FAVORITES AND DONATING TO LIBRARIES OR SHARING WITH OTHERS DOUBLE WIN
I MOSTLY LOVE HISTORICAL USED BOOKS THEY ARE CHARMING
YEAH I LOOK BUYING SECOND HAND ESPECIALLY OLD PRINTS I LOVE IT WHEN THERE'S LIKE AN OLD RECEIPT USED AS A BOOKMARK OR SOMEONE'S NOTES IN THERE
I REALLY ENJOYED THE FIRST DIRK GENTLY BOOK BUT I DIDN'T GET MUCH OUT OF TEA TIME OF THE SOUL JUST TO WARN YOU

CAT'S CRADLE IS GREAT THOUGH I DON'T KNOW HOW IT MANAGED TO BE SO LIGHT HEARTED AND SO POIGNANT AT THE SAME TIME
GO TO MOTHER NIGHT IMHO ONE OF HIS BEST
HOLY SHIT I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT ADAMS WRITING THAT FELT SIMILAR NEVER CONSIDERED INFLUENCE
I LIKED CAT'S CRADLE OVER SIRENS OF TITAN THERE'S A POIGNANCY TO A BOOK ABOUT MUD HOW SCIENCE TRIES TO RULE IT AND RELIGION TRIES TO GLORIFY IT AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S JUST MUD

I'VE BEEN WORKING MY WAY THROUGH WELCOME TO THE MONKEY HOUSE AND IT'S JUST HIT AFTER HIT ENJOY LONG DARK I REMEMBER LOVING IT
YES LOVED BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS REALLY AFFECTED BY SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE
I'M CONVINCED THAT VONNEGUT IS A GENIUS THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER BOOK LIKE SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE
MOTHER NIGHT IS MY FAVORITE I THINK CAT'S CRADLE MIGHT BE HIS BEST WORK BUT MOTHER NIGHT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER BOOKS IT'S LESS CYNICAL BUT NOT PARTICULARLY OPTIMISTIC BUT IT'S ALSO LESS ZANY THAT ASIDE TRADEMARK SARCASM IS IN FULL EFFECT AND YET THE MESSAGE IS DELIVERED POTENTLY WITH A SOLEMN DIGNITY

I'LL ADD THAT IT'S PROBABLY HIS MOST TRADITIONAL NOVEL
I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT BUT AFTER READING THE LAST SENTENCE OF YEARS OF SOLITUDE I HAD TO CLOSE MY BOOK AND REEVALUATE LIFE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS I'VE READ
SOME CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS BOOK HAD THE POEM THE RAIN IT FALLS UPON THE JUST AND ALSO ON THE UNJUST FELLA BUT MOSTLY IT FALLS UPON THE JUST FOR THE UNJUST HATH THE
UMBRELLA

EVERY LIFE IS IN MANY DAYS DAY AFTER DAY WE WALK THROUGH OURSELVES MEETING ROBBERS GHOSTS GIANTS OLD MEN YOUNG MEN WIVES WIDOWS BUT ALWAYS MEETING OURSELVES

JAMES JOYCE ULYSSES

POPS INTO MY HEAD ALMOST EVERYDAY ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M WALKING THROUGH CROWDS OBSERVING OTHER PEOPLE WHO SEEM SUPERFICIALLY DIFFERENT
WELL FIGHT CLUB HAD FAR TOO MANY QUOTABLE THINGS BUT HERE'S WHAT I CAN FIND RIGHT NOW

WE DON T HAVE A GREAT WAR IN OUR GENERATION OR A GREAT DEPRESSION BUT WE DO WE HAVE A GREAT WAR OF THE SPIRIT WE HAVE A GREAT REVOLUTION AGAINST THE CULTURE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IS OUR LIVES WE HAVE A SPIRITUAL DEPRESSION FIGHT CLUB CHUCK PALAHNUIK

THE ONLY PEOPLE FOR ME ARE THE MAD ONES THE ONES WHO ARE MAD TO LIVE MAD TO TALK MAD TO BE SAVED DESIROUS OF EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME THE ONES WHO NEVER YAWN OR SAY A COMMONPLACE THING BUT BURN BURN BURN LIKE FABULOUS YELLOW ROMAN CANDLES EXPLODING LIKE SPIDERS ACROSS THE STARS AND IN THE MIDDLE YOU SEE THE BLUE COUNTERLIGHT POP AND EVERYBODY GOES AWIWI
JACK KEROUAC ON THE ROAD

TO BE HONEST I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH THE REST OF THE BOOK HOWEVER I WAS COMPELLED TO FINISH THE BOOK ONCE I READ THIS PASSAGE THIS PASSAGE BRINGS ABOUT MY OWN FEELINGS OF MALCONTENT BUT ALSO BRINGS ABOUT THE MEMORIES WHEN I'VE GOTTEN TOO DRUNK LAUGHED TOO HARD LOVED TOO QUICKLY ETC AND REMINDS ME OF THE BRILLIANCE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT WHEN WE FIND THAT BARE DESIRE FOR PASSION THAT RESIDES IN US QUIETLY BUT IS ALSO FOUND IN OTHERS AND WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU CLICK WITH SOMEONE THE MOMENT SIZZLES LIKE A STEAK HITTING A HOT BBQ
THE FINAL PARAGRAPH OF CORMAC THE ROAD HAUNTS ME TO THIS DAY

ONCE THERE WERE BROOK TROUTS IN THE STREAMS IN THE MOUNTAINS YOU COULD SEE THEM STANDING IN THE AMBER CURRENT WHERE THE WHITE EDGES OF THEIR FINS WIMPLED SOFTLY IN THE FLOW THEY SMELLED OF MOSS IN YOUR HAND POLISHED AND MUSCULAR AND TORSIONAL ON THEIR BACKS WERE VERMICULATE PATTERNS THAT WERE MAPS OF THE WORLD IN ITS BECOMING MAPS AND MAZES OF A THING WHICH COULD NOT BE PUT BACK NOT BE MADE RIGHT AGAIN IN THE DEEP GLENS WHERE THEY LIVED ALL THINGS WERE OLDER THAN MAN AND THEY HUMMED OF MYSTERY

THE IMAGE OF SOMETHING SO ANCIENT YET RESILIENT IN WHAT'S OTHERWISE BEEN AN ENDLESS STREAM OF DESOLATION POWERFUL

WHAT A LUXURY IT WAS FOR PEOPLE TO HOLD THEIR LOVED ONES WHENEVER THEY WANTED
CECELIA AHERN PAGE SOUTH I LOVE YOU
I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT BUT THE LAST LINE OF COMPLAINT WAS HILARIOUS
I GIVE YOU THE MAUSOLEUM OF ALL HOPE AND DESIRE I GIVE IT TO YOU NOT THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER TIME BUT THAT YOU MIGHT FORGET IT NOW AND THEN FOR A MOMENT AND NOT SPEND ALL OF YOUR BREATH TRYING TO CONQUER IT BECAUSE NO BATTLE IS EVER WON HE SAID THEY ARE NOT EVEN FOUGHT THE FIELD ONLY REVEALS TO MAN HIS OWN FOLLY AND DESPAIR AND VICTORY IS AN ILLUSION OF PHILOSOPHERS AND FOOLS WILLIAM FAULKNER THE SOUND AND THE FURY
THIS ABOVE ALL TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE

I ALSO LOVE THE FINAL STANZA OF PRUFROCK
WE HAVE LINGERED IN THE CHAMBER OF THE SEA
BY WREATHED WITH SEAWEED RED AND BROWN
TILL HUMAN VOICES WAKE US AND WE DROWN


I DON'T MEAN TO SPOIL THE PARTY SEEMS TO BE GOING JUST FINE HOWEVER NONE OF THE QUOTES MAKE ANY SENSE LAID OUT BARE AND BARREN WITHOUT CONTEXT

NOT THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY QUOTES TO OFFER IT'S JUST REALIZATION HOW MUCH THE CONTEXT OF THE BOOK GAVE BOOST TO ITS MEANING IN FACT THE ONLY MEANING

THE BUILD UP THAT WORKS IT'S WAY TO THAT POINT IT'S LIKE A PRESSURE IN YOUR HEAD RISING AND RISING AS YOU DIVE DEEPER AND DEEPER TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF DRAMATIC CRESCENDO AS YOU READ YOU FIGHT AND FIGHT TO ENDURE AND RIGHT AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE READY TO GIVE UP THAT QUOTE COMES UP LIKE SOME LITERARY FAIRY SITTING AT THE BOTTOM AND GIVES YOU INSTANT MOUTH TO MOUTH BREATH OF FRESH AIR
CAN'T SAY THE LINE BUT THE VERY LAST SENTENCE OF DAN NOVEL BROOD TOOK THAT EXCELLENT BOOK TO ANOTHER LEVEL
DOES SUCH A THING AS THE FATAL FLAW THAT SHOWY DARK CRACK RUNNING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF A LIFE EXIST OUTSIDE LITERATURE I USED TO THINK IT DIDN'T NOW I THINK IT DOES AND I THINK THAT MINE IS THIS A MORBID LONGING FOR THE PICTURESQUE AT ALL COSTS THE SECRET HISTORY

THIS IS IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE BOOK AND I LOVED THE ENTIRE BOOK BUT THIS STILL PLAYS IN MY HEAD OFTEN MONTHS AFTER READING
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDABLY ALWAYS QUOTES THE LINES FROM EAST OF EDEN ABOUT TIMSHEL THIS ONE WAS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE AND I FIND MYSELF REFLECTING ON IT OFTEN

MAYBE IT'S TRUE THAT WE ARE ALL DESCENDED FROM THE RESTLESS THE NERVOUS THE CRIMINALS THE ARGUERS AND BRAWLERS BUT ALSO THE BRAVE AND INDEPENDENT AND GENEROUS IF OUR ANCESTORS HAD NOT BEEN THAT THEY WOULD HAVE STAYED IN THEIR HOME PLOTS IN THE OTHER WORLD AND STARVED OVER THE SOIL
HELL IS THE ABSENCE OF THE PEOPLE YOU LONG FOR EMILY STREET JOHN MANDEL STATION ELEVEN

SUBTREE CORMAC MCCARTHY

MY TOP TEN QUOTES LIST HAS LIKE FIVE FROM THAT BOOK
THE LAST LINE OF THE LAST QUESTION BY ASIMOV
WHEN THE MONSTER KILLS THE WOMAN MOTHER ON THE BOAT IS WHAT I REMEMBER OF THE SCENE

IT IS SO LONG BEFORE THE MIND CAN PERSUADE ITSELF THAT SHE WHOM WE SAW EVERYDAY AND WHOSE VERY EXISTENCE APPEARED A PART OF OUR OWN CAN HAVE DEPARTED FOR EVER THAT THE BRIGHTNESS OF A BELOVED EYE CAN HAVE BEEN EXTINGUISHED AND DEAR TO THE EAR CAN BE HUSHED NEVER MORE TO BE HEARD FRANKENSTEIN
AND SO IT IS WITH GOD FROM LIFE OF PI REALLY MADE ME SMILE THOUGH I STILL THINK IT'S NOT THAT GREAT AS A NOVEL
IT BEGINS WITH ABSENCE AND DESIRE
IT BEGINS WITH BLOOD AND FEAR
IT BEGINS WITH A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES

DEBORAH HARKNESS A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES

SIGN AT A BOOKSTORE HETP

MY SPINELESS COPY OF THE PRINCESS BRIDE
WELL YOU COULD GO TO YOUR MANAGE YOUR CONTENT DEVICES FROM YOUR ACCOUNT PAGE THEN IN THE SETTINGS TAB CHANGE THE COUNTRY BUT YOU'LL NEED TO SUPPLY A LINE OF ADDRESS AFTER WHICH I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY

I RECALL MY ACCOUNT WAS ORIGINALLY THE US ONE NOW CHANGED TO MY RESPECTIVE COUNTRY

EDIT DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE YOUR COUNTRY BACK
I JUST RECEIVED A BOOK FROM AMAZON UK I LIVE IN US TRY AGAIN

ENJOY THE RIDE EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE LATER
CONSIDER YOU ARE IN CHAPTER OF PAGE OF AT LEAST IN MY COPY ALWAYS TRUST IN VONNEGUT HE DELIVERS
RIDE IT OUT THERE ARE THREADS THAT YOU WON'T SEE CONNECTED UNTIL MUCH LATER IN THE BOOK IS THIS YOUR FIRST VONNEGUT BOOK IT MIGHT BE A TOUGH ONE TO USE AS AN ENTRY POINT BUT GOOD LUCK IT'S ALL GREAT
WOW WHAT A COINCIDENCE I ONLY JUST FINISHED READING IT TONIGHT

ITS A GOLDRUN
IT'S PART OF THE CHARM OF VONNEGUT ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT YEP JUST GO ALONG FOR THE RIDE AND ENJOY HIS MIND
EVERYTHING CONNECTS IN THE END AND THE EARLY CONFUSION AND AMBIGUITY IS PART OF THE STORY IT ALL PRETTY MUCH SYNTHESIZES IN THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS BUT IT SYNTHESIZES WELL AND IT IS WORTH IT DON'T GIVE UP
JUST READ IT IT WILL MAKE SENSE
OP I THINK YOU NEED TO READ MORE THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF LOVE STORIES WITH MALE PROTAGONISTS IN CLASSIC LITERATURE
LOVE IS STILL AN INCREDIBLY FUNDAMENTAL EMOTION AND SO I'M SURPRISED THAT NO GREAT WRITER HAS NOT WRITTEN A GREAT LOVE STORY FROM A MAN'S PERSPECTIVE

I'M CONFUSED BY THE DOUBLE NEGATIVE ARE YOU REALLY SAYING NO GREAT WRITER HAS EVER WRITTEN A LOVE STORY FROM A MAN'S PERSPECTIVE
THERE ARE A LOT OF LOVE STORIES WHERE THE PROTAGONIST IS A MANUAL

ARE YOU SAYING A ROMANCE STORY LIKE A BODICE RIPPER WHERE THE MAIN CHARACTER IS MALE
LOTS OF GREAT NOVELS HAVE A MAN'S LOVE AT THEIR CORE THE GREAT GATSBY IS THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE I CAN THINK OF BUT HOW ABOUT LONG JOURNEY TO LOVE IN ANNA KARENINA IN GREAT EXPECTATIONS IN DAVID COPPERFIELD AND WHILE I'M TRAVELLING BACKWARDS IN TIME DARCY IN PRIDE AND PREJUDICE TOM IN TOM JONES
I LIKE A SIDE OF LOVE WITH MY STORIES NOT THE WHOLE ENTREE

THAT SAID I'M ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY A SCIFI READER

I THINK THE RED RISING TRILOGY BY OUR OWN PIERCE BROWN DOES A DAMN GOOD JOB OF CREATING A REAL AND COMPLEX LOVE STORY THE BOOK ISN'T JUST ABOUT LOVE BUT IT IS A THEME THAT RUNS THROUGHOUT THE BOOK WHICH DICTATES THE MAIN CHARACTER'S MOTIVATION IN VERY INTRICATE WAYS

THERE JUST HAPPENS TO BE A LOT OF BLOOD GUTS AND SPACE BATTLES AS WELL
WHAT ABOUT A WESTERN FROM A HORSES PERSPECTIVE
I LOVED SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION
THERE'S TENDER IS THE NIGHT BY SCOTT FITZGERALD
CYRANO DE BERGERAC

I'D READ A LOVE STORY WHERE EVERYONE WAS A MAN
YOU THINK IF YOU WROTE ONE IT'D BE THE FIRST

YOU THINK THAT

READ MORE I GUESS
ISN'T THAT WHAT EVERY OTHER GENRE IS
OTHERS ARE RIGHT IN POINTING OUT THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF BOOKS LIKE THIS THEY JUST AREN'T CALLED ROMANCES BUT I'D TOTALLY READ A STRAIGHT-UP MILLS BOON REGENCY ROMANCE TOLD FROM A MALE POV
I'VE READ A LOT OF ROMANCE NOVELS GUILTY PLEASURE AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME THAT ARE MOSTLY FROM A MALE PERSPECTIVE

OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD ONE MAINSTREAM NOVEL WITH A LOVE STORY THAT HAS A MALE PROTAGONIST IS THE TIME WIFE
OF COURSE I WOULD THERE ARE LOTS OF AMAZING STORIES OUT THERE ABOUT MEN WHO WANT TO FALL IN LOVE MR HOUR BOOKSTORE AND THE ROSIE PROJECT ARE TWO MODERN BOOKS THAT COME TO MIND THE NIGHT CIRCUS ALSO DEALT WITH THE ROMANTIC FEELINGS OF MEN AND IF YOU MEAN A GRAND SWEEPING PRIDE AND ROMANCE FROM A MAN'S PERSPECTIVE THEN YES I'D READ THAT LISA ROMANCE BOOKS ALSO FREQUENTLY HAVE MANY CHAPTERS ALMOST HALF OF THEM DEDICATED TO THE MAN'S POV
I'VE READ AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE ROSIE PROJECT WHOSE PROTAGONIST IS MALE
I THOROUGHLY ENJOY LOVE STORIES WHERE THE MAN IS THE PROTAGONIST I'M A FEMALE I JUST FIND IT INTERESTING TO READ FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE
I WOULD READ IT IF I READ
IS IT LIKE THE DROP CAP SERIES WHERE THEY COMPLETELY SKIMP ON THE MATERIALS ALL OF THE MATERIALS

GLUED BINDING ON A DOLLAR HARDBACK GET FUCKED PENGUIN GET FUCKED

HOLES BY LOUIS ACHAR IS A MUST READ
TRAVELS WERE ALWAYS A FAVORITE OF MINE AS A KID ANOTHER WAS DR DOOLITTLE I HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF MY PARENTS READING THE FORMER TO ME AS A CHILD WHILE I REMEMBER MY GRANDMOTHER READING THE LATTER TO ME WHILE ON VACATION
I REMEMBER THAT I REALLY LIKED SOME GORDON KORMAN BOOKS WHEN I WAS THAT AGE OR A LITTLE OLDER

I ALSO READ AND LOVED A BUNCH OF CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE BOOKS
RICK SERIES PERCY JACKSON MAGNUS CHASE HEROES OF OLYMPUS
THE RANGERS APPRENTICE SERIES IS REALLY GOOD I GOT INTO THEM AROUND THAT AGE AND I'VE OCCASIONALLY GONE BACK TO READ THEM AND THEY STILL HOLD UP AND APPEAL TO MY ROUGE SIDE
ARTHUR SWALLOWS AND AMAZON SERIES ADVENTUROUS SAILING SIBLINGS CIPPI LONGSTOCKING GO FOR AN OLDER TRANSLATION MADELEINE A WRINKLE IN TIME CS LEWIS NARNIA SERIES MARY THE BORROWERS
PROBABLY CLOSER TO THAN BUT I THINK KATE GREENGLASS HOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY LOVELY JUST LIKE KEVIN SANDS THE BLACKTHORN KEY BOTH HAVE DEATH IN THEM THE SECOND ONE IS ABOUT SOLVING A CONSPIRACY AND ALL BUT ONCE HE WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT I WOULD GIVE THEM A SHOT
THE HOUNDS OF THE MORRIGAN BY PAT O'SHEA IS AN AMAZING BOOK THAT NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW ABOUT I FOUND IT BY CHANCE WHEN I WAS ABOUT AND FELL COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH IT IT'S A BIT DENSE BUT REALLY WORTH THE TIME
THE SECRET WORLD OF OG BY PIERRE BERTON

I HAVE BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR MY NEPHEWS FOR THEM TO ENJOY WHEN THEY GET OLD ENOUGH IT'S MYSTERY ADVENTURE AND STRONG FAMILY TIES
YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH RANGERS APPRENTICE THEY ARE WRITTEN BY JOHN FLANAGAN AND ARE A FANTASTIC READ
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE MT THRILLING TALES SERIES THEY REBRANCHED IT TO PALS IN PERIL SINCE I FIRST READ THE FIRST BOOK IS CALLED WHALES ON STILTS NOT QUITE AS LITERARY AS HARRY POTTER ETC BUT IT'S A HILARIOUS AND CLEVER SERIES THAT HAS THINGS FOR BOTH YOU AND YOUR KID TO APPRECIATE EACH BOOK SATIRIZES TO AN EXTENT A DIFFERENT CATEGORY OF GENRE FARE I EAST HARDY MYSTERIES PULPY ADVENTURE STORIES ETC IT'S VERY SELF AWARE AND FUN READING I READ THEM AROUND AGE OR AND LOVED THEM DISCLAIMER ONLY THE FIRST THREE BOOKS WERE OUT THEN AND I NEVER GOT AROUND TO CATCHING UP ON THE REST BUT THE FIRST THREE WERE WONDERFUL THEY AREN'T QUITE AS WELL KNOWN BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM I ALWAYS FELT LIKE THEY SHOULD BEEN THE NEXT SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS THAT NEVER QUITE TOOK OFFICIAL

EDIT HIS DARK MATERIALS IS ALSO A FANTASTIC AND WELL REGARDED TRILOGY IF YOUR SON LIKES FANTASY

REMOVED
MAY I ASK HOW YOU GOT THE JOB WHAT IS YOUR QUALIFICATION I AM SURE THERE IS ONE SO NOT ANYBODY CAN GET THAT JOB I WORK AT A LIBRARY PART TIMES SO EVERY BIT OF BAD FICTION I GET TO READ HAS BEEN PUBLISHED SADLY
I WAS MOST CAPTURED BY
A MAN WHO PROCRASTINATES IN HIS CHOOSING WILL INEVITABLY HAVE HIS CHOICE MADE FOR HIM BY CIRCUMSTANCE

MOTIVATING AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING READ
BUT BEWARE OF LOOKING FOR GOALS LOOK FOR A WAY OF LIFE DECIDE HOW YOU WANT TO LIVE AND THEN SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO TO MAKE A LIVING WITHIN THAT WAY OF LIFE
MY FAVORITE EXCERPT
N O ONE HAS TO DO SOMETHING HE DOESN T WANT TO DO FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE BUT THEN AGAIN IF THAT S WHAT YOU WIND UP DOING BY ALL MEANS CONVINCE YOURSELF THAT YOU HAD TO DO IT YOU LL HAVE LOTS OF COMPANY
IN SHORT HE HAS NOT DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO REACHING A GOAL BUT HE HAS RATHER CHOSEN A WAY OF LIFE HE KNOWS HE WILL ENJOY

MY FAVORITE PART I TRY TO TELL MYSELF EVERYTHING I DO IN LIFE IS JUST SOMETHING TO OCCUPY MY TIME AND MAINTAIN HAPPINESS
IMPRESSIVE THAT HE HAD THAT FIGURED OUT AT
THAT WAS AMAZING I NEVER REALLY FULLY READ ON REDDIN I KIND OF GLOSS OVER THINGS NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS ABOUT THIS LETTER BUT I JUST READ THE WHOLE THING AND IT WAS FILLING AND CLEAR I FEEL BETTER FOR READING IT BUT THEN IT JUST ENDED AND I WANT MORE I HAVE NEVER READ ANY HUNTER SOUTH THOMPSON I WILL NOW
FINALLY CAME AROUND TO READING IT GEEZ I NEEDED THAT THANKS OP
IN SUMMARY YOU MUST CHOOSE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER TO EITHER CHANGE YOURSELF TO SUIT YOUR GOALS OR CHANGE YOUR GOALS TO SUIT YOURSELF NOT MAKING THIS DECISION LEAVES YOU AT BITTER MERCY
SAVED FOR LATER
FOR THOSE WHO DONT WANT TO VISIT THE WEBSITE


DEAR HUME

YOU ASK ADVICE AH WHAT A VERY HUMAN AND VERY DANGEROUS THING TO DO FOR TO GIVE ADVICE TO A MAN WHO ASKS WHAT TO DO WITH HIS LIFE IMPLIES SOMETHING VERY CLOSE TO EGOMANIA TO PRESUME TO POINT A MAN TO THE RIGHT AND ULTIMATE GOAL TO POINT WITH A TREMBLING FINGER IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IS SOMETHING ONLY A FOOL WOULD TAKE UPON HIMSELF

I AM NOT A FOOL BUT I RESPECT YOUR SINCERITY IN ASKING MY ADVICE I ASK YOU THOUGH IN LISTENING TO WHAT I SAY TO REMEMBER THAT ALL ADVICE CAN ONLY BE A PRODUCT OF THE MAN WHO GIVES IT WHAT IS TRUTH TO ONE MAY BE DISASTER TO ANOTHER I DO NOT SEE LIFE THROUGH YOUR EYES NOR YOU THROUGH MINE IF I WERE TO ATTEMPT TO GIVE YOU SPECIFIC ADVICE IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH LIKE THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND

TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TIS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE OR TO TAKE ARMS AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLES SHAKESPEARE

AND INDEED THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TO FLOAT WITH THE TIDE OR TO SWIM FOR A GOAL IT IS A CHOICE WE MUST ALL MAKE CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY AT ONE TIME IN OUR LIVES SO FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS THINK OF ANY DECISION YOU VE EVER MADE WHICH HAD A BEARING ON YOUR FUTURE I MAY BE WRONG BUT I DON T SEE HOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYTHING BUT A CHOICE HOWEVER INDIRECT BETWEEN THE TWO THINGS I VE MENTIONED THE FLOATING OR THE SWIMMING

BUT WHY NOT FLOAT IF YOU HAVE NO GOAL THAT IS ANOTHER QUESTION IT IS UNQUESTIONABLY BETTER TO ENJOY THE FLOATING THAN TO SWIM IN UNCERTAINTY SO HOW DOES A MAN FIND A GOAL NOT A CASTLE IN THE STARS BUT A REAL AND TANGIBLE THING HOW CAN A MAN BE SURE HE S NOT AFTER THE BIG ROCK CANDY MOUNTAIN THE ENTICING SUGAR-CANDY GOAL THAT HAS LITTLE TASTE AND NO SUBSTANCE

THE ANSWER AND IN A SENSE THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE IS THAT WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND THE GOAL AND NOT THE MANUAL WE SET UP A GOAL WHICH DEMANDS OF US CERTAIN THINGS AND WE DO THESE THINGS WE ADJUST TO THE DEMANDS OF A CONCEPT WHICH CANNOT BE VALID WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG LET US SAY THAT YOU WANTED TO BE A FIREMAN I FEEL REASONABLY SAFE IN SAYING THAT YOU NO LONGER WANT TO BE A FIREMAN WHY BECAUSE YOUR PERSPECTIVE HAS CHANGED IT S NOT THE FIREMAN WHO HAS CHANGED BUT YOU EVERY MAN IS THE SUM TOTAL OF HIS REACTIONS TO EXPERIENCE AS YOUR EXPERIENCES DIFFER AND MULTIPLY YOU BECOME A DIFFERENT MAN AND HENCE YOUR PERSPECTIVE CHANGES THIS GOES ON AND ON EVERY REACTION IS A LEARNING PROCESS EVERY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE ALTERS YOUR PERSPECTIVE

SO IT WOULD SEEM FOOLISH WOULD IT NOT TO ADJUST OUR LIVES TO THE DEMANDS OF A GOAL WE SEE FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE EVERY DAY HOW COULD WE EVER HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING OTHER THAN GALLOPING NEUROSIS

THE ANSWER THEN MUST NOT DEAL WITH GOALS AT ALL OR NOT WITH TANGIBLE GOALS ANYWAY IT WOULD TAKE REAMS OF PAPER TO DEVELOP THIS SUBJECT TO FULFILLMENT GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ON THE MEANING OF MAN AND THAT SORT OF THING AND GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE PONDERED THE SUBJECT I USE THE TERM GOD ONLY KNOWS PURELY AS AN EXPRESSION THERE S VERY LITTLE SENSE IN MY TRYING TO GIVE IT UP TO YOU IN THE PROVERBIAL NUTSHELL BECAUSE I M THE FIRST TO ADMIT MY ABSOLUTE LACK OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR REDUCING THE MEANING OF LIFE TO ONE OR TWO PARAGRAPHS

I M GOING TO STEER CLEAR OF THE WORD EXISTENTIALISM BUT YOU MIGHT KEEP IT IN MIND AS A KEY OF SORTS YOU MIGHT ALSO TRY SOMETHING CALLED BEING AND NOTHINGNESS BY SARTRE AND ANOTHER LITTLE THING CALLED EXISTENTIALISM FROM DOSTOYEVSKY TO SARTRE THESE ARE MERELY SUGGESTIONS IF YOU RE GENUINELY SATISFIED WITH WHAT YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU RE DOING THEN GIVE THOSE BOOKS A WIDE BERTH LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE BUT BACK TO THE ANSWER AS I SAID TO PUT OUR FAITH IN TANGIBLE GOALS WOULD SEEM TO BE AT BEST UNWISE SO WE DO NOT STRIVE TO BE FIREMEN WE DO NOT STRIVE TO BE BANKERS NOR POLICEMEN NOR STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES

BUT DON T MISUNDERSTAND ME I DON T MEAN THAT WE CAN T BE FIREMEN BANKERS OR DOCTORS BUT THAT WE MUST MAKE THE GOAL CONFORM TO THE INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN MAKE THE INDIVIDUAL CONFORM TO THE GOAL IN EVERY MAN HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT HAVE COMBINED TO PRODUCE A CREATURE OF CERTAIN ABILITIES AND DESIRES INCLUDING A DEEPLY INGRAINED NEED TO FUNCTION IN SUCH A WAY THAT HIS LIFE WILL BE MEANINGFUL A MAN HAS TO BE SOMETHING HE HAS TO MATTER

AS I SEE IT THEN THE FORMULA RUNS SOMETHING LIKE THIS A MAN MUST CHOOSE A PATH WHICH WILL LET HIS ABILITIES FUNCTION AT MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY TOWARD THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS DESIRES IN DOING THIS HE IS FULFILLING A NEED GIVING HIMSELF IDENTITY BY FUNCTIONING IN A SET PATTERN TOWARD A SET GOAL HE AVOIDS FRUSTRATING HIS POTENTIAL CHOOSING A PATH WHICH PUTS NO LIMIT ON HIS SELF-DEVELOPMENT AND HE AVOIDS THE TERROR OF SEEING HIS GOAL WILT OR LOSE ITS CHARM AS HE DRAWS CLOSER TO IT RATHER THAN BENDING HIMSELF TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THAT WHICH HE SEEKS HE HAS BENT HIS GOAL TO CONFORM TO HIS OWN ABILITIES AND DESIRES

IN SHORT HE HAS NOT DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO REACHING A GOAL BUT HE HAS RATHER CHOSEN A WAY OF LIFE HE KNOWS HE WILL ENJOY THE GOAL IS ABSOLUTELY SECONDARY IT IS THE FUNCTIONING TOWARD THE GOAL WHICH IS IMPORTANT AND IT SEEMS ALMOST RIDICULOUS TO SAY THAT A MAN MUST FUNCTION IN A PATTERN OF HIS OWN CHOOSING FOR TO LET ANOTHER MAN DEFINE YOUR OWN GOALS IS TO GIVE UP ONE OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL ASPECTS OF LIFE THE DEFINITIVE ACT OF WILL WHICH MAKES A MAN AN INDIVIDUAL

LET S ASSUME THAT YOU THINK YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF EIGHT PATHS TO FOLLOW ALL PATHS OF COURSE AND LET S ASSUME THAT YOU CAN T SEE ANY REAL PURPOSE IN ANY OF THE EIGHT THEN AND HERE IS THE ESSENCE OF ALL I VE SAID YOU MUST FIND A NINTH PATHOLOGY

NATURALLY IT ISN T AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS YOU VE LIVED A RELATIVELY NARROW LIFE A VERTICAL RATHER THAN A HORIZONTAL EXISTENCE SO IT ISN T ANY TOO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU SEEM TO FEEL THE WAY YOU DO BUT A MAN WHO PROCRASTINATES IN HIS CHOOSING WILL INEVITABLY HAVE HIS CHOICE MADE FOR HIM BY CIRCUMSTANCE

SO IF YOU NOW NUMBER YOURSELF AMONG THE DISENCHANTED THEN YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THINGS AS THEY ARE OR TO SERIOUSLY SEEK SOMETHING ELSE BUT BEWARE OF LOOKING FOR GOALS LOOK FOR A WAY OF LIFE DECIDE HOW YOU WANT TO LIVE AND THEN SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO TO MAKE A LIVING WITHIN THAT WAY OF LIFE BUT YOU SAY I DON T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK I DON T KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR

AND THERE S THE CRUX IS IT WORTH GIVING UP WHAT I HAVE TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING BETTER I DON T KNOW IS IT WHO CAN MAKE THAT DECISION BUT YOU BUT EVEN BY DECIDING TO LOOK YOU GO A LONG WAY TOWARD MAKING THE CHOICE

IF I DON T CALL THIS TO A HALT I M GOING TO FIND MYSELF WRITING A BOOK I HOPE IT S NOT AS CONFUSING AS IT LOOKS AT FIRST GLANCE KEEP IN MIND OF COURSE THAT THIS IS MY WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT IT S PRETTY GENERALLY APPLICABLE BUT YOU MAY NOT EACH OF US HAS TO CREATE OUR OWN CREDO THIS MERELY HAPPENS TO BE MINE

IF ANY PART OF IT DOESN T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE BY ALL MEANS CALL IT TO MY ATTENTION I M NOT TRYING TO SEND YOU OUT ON THE ROAD IN SEARCH OF VALHALLA BUT MERELY POINTING OUT THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ACCEPT THE CHOICES HANDED DOWN TO YOU BY LIFE AS YOU KNOW IT THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN THAT NO ONE HAS TO DO SOMETHING HE DOESN T WANT TO DO FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE BUT THEN AGAIN IF THAT S WHAT YOU WIND UP DOING BY ALL MEANS CONVINCE YOURSELF THAT YOU HAD TO DO IT YOU LL HAVE LOTS OF COMPANY

AND THAT S IT FOR NOW UNTIL I HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN I REMAIN

YOUR FRIEND
HUNTER
MY FAVORITE QUOTE FROM THIS WAS IT IS UNQUESTIONABLY BETTER TO ENJOY THE FLOATING THAN TO SWIM IN UNCERTAINTY I STRUGGLE WITH FEELING STAGNANT LIKE EACH DAY THAT PASSES IS ANOTHER ASSAULT AGAINST THE GRAND VISIONS I ONCE HAD FOR MY FUTURE SOMEHOW I'M SEEMINGLY NEVER ABLE TO LIVE UP TO MY OWN EXPECTATIONS THIS LETTER HELPED SOLIDIFY THE IDEA THAT IT IS OKAY TO FLOAT TO ACCEPT LIFE AND MY CURRENT PERSPECTIVE AS BEING EVER CHANGING AND TO FROM THIS MOMENT ENJOY THE RIDE AND TO MAKE MY LIFE MORE HORIZONTAL RATHER THAN IMPOSSIBLY VERTICAL
BUT THAT WE MUST MAKE THE GOAL CONFORM TO THE INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN MAKE THE INDIVIDUAL CONFORM TO THE GOAL

OOOH GOOD REMINDER
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS EVERYTHING HE WROTE IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF WHERE MY LIFE IS CURRENTLY HOPEFULLY I WILL TAKE IT TO HEART
I LOVE HST AND I THINK THIS IS BEAUTIFUL ADVICE I'VE PASSED THIS ON TO MY KIDS WHO ARE ABOUT TO HAVE TO START MAKING SOME OF THESE DECISIONS HELL I'M IN MY AND GOT SOMETHING FROM IT

THAT SAID MY GOD THE PRETENTIOUSNESS OF THAT OPENING PARAGRAPH IT'S LIKE HE SAT DOWN WITH THE GOAL OF SOUNDING LIKE HE WAS WRITING THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE NO HEY HUME THANKS FOR WRITING BUT FORSOOTH AND ALAS DEAR FRIEND WITH WHOM I QUAFFED ALES PLENTIFULLY THIS PAST MOON
DECADES AGO WHEN I WAS ABOUT AGE I READ THE REFERENCED WORK BEING IN NOTHINGNESS AND MOST OF AYN NOVELS AND CAME AWAY WITH AT LEAST A FOOTING FOR LOOKING AT LIFE

IN MY CASE FOR THE MOST PART I TOOK THE ROAD MOST TRAVELLED THE READINGS GAVE ME A KIND OF CONFIDENCE TO DO SO I DIDN'T FEEL A NEED TO FIND A NONCONFORMIST PATH BUT WHEN I DID I TOOK THAT TOO AND ALSO WITH CONFIDENCE
WHILE READING I COULD HELP BUT ASK MYSELF EXACTLY HOW MUCH PEYOTE HAS THIS MAN DONE AND WHY HAVEN'T I DONE THE SAME
I LOVE HOW HE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE WAS HAPPY HE MIGHT WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THE EXISTENTIAL LITERATURE THAT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AS WELL
THIS IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE MOST MEANINGFUL LITERATURE THAT I HAVE EVER READ

THANK YOU HUNTER

MAY YOU REST IN ETERNAL PEACE
MAN THOMPSON WAS A CRAZY BRILLIANT BASTARD


THERE'S SOME REAL WISDOM HERE GREAT READ
THIS HIT ME PRETTY PROFOUNDLY

SO WE DO NOT STRIVE TO BE FIREMEN WE DO NOT STRIVE TO BE BANKERS NOR POLICEMEN NOR STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES

DOES IT STILL APPLY TODAY SADLY I DON'T COMPLETELY BELIEVE IT DOES
I WONDER WHAT HE WOULD SAY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO FELT LIKE THEY HAD A CALLING NOT NECESSARILY THAT THEY FELT THAT THEY HAD TO DO IT BUT THAT THEY WERE DESTINED FOR IT
I DON'T ENTIRELY AGREE OR DISAGREE AT ONE POINT SETTING A GOAL AND STRIVING WITH FANATICAL DEVOTION IS THE ONLY WAY ANYONE HAS MADE THEMSELVES INTO WHAT HUMANITY WOULD COLLECTIVELY CALL GREAT YET MANY WHO DO TAKE THE ROUTE OF GOAL STRIVING EITHER FAIL BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF EFFORT OR LACK OF ABILITY THE OLD COLLEGE ATHLETE WHO REMINISCES OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS

ON THE OTHER HAND SETTING YOUR OWN PATH IS ONLY TRULY VIABLE FOR THOSE WHO ALREADY POSSESS THE ABILITIES AND MENTAL FORTITUDE TO SUCCEED AT WHATEVER THEIR HEART DESIRES TO DO THINK OF A DA VINCI SORT OF MAN BLAZING A TRAIL WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO SURVIVE WILL LEAVE YOU DEAD OR CRAWLING BACK TO THE PREDEFINED TRAILS WHICH YOU WANTED TO AVOID

WHAT IS THE SOLUTION TRY AND FAIL PERHAPS YOU MAY BE THE ONE IN TEN THOUSAND THAT MAKE IT TO TRUE MASTERY OF A SPORT OR ART BUT IF NOT DO YOUR BEST TO RECOVER AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE FLOATING THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT A GOAL SEEMS LIKE AN EASY WAY TO BUILD APATHY AND DEPRESSION IF YOU CONTINUALLY STRIVE AND FAIL AT LEAST AT THE END OF YOUR LIFE YOU CAN SAY THAT YOU EXPERIENCED MORE THAN MOST DURING THEIR TIME ON EARTH
I COULDN'T NOT HEAR JOHNNY DEEPS VOICE IN MY HEAD WHILE READING THIS
ALTHOUGH I'D USUALLY BE WARY OF A GUY WHO SNORTS COCAINE FOR BREAKFAST THIS LETTER IS PRETTY GOOD AND HAS SOME NICE MOMENTS OF WISDOM IN THERE
OP THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR POSTING THIS
IF YOU DONT REMEMBER TH ARTICLE AT ALL AFTER READING OR WERE JUST TOO LAZY JUST REMEMBER THIS QUOTE

BUT THAT WE MUST MAKE THE GOAL CONFORM TO THE INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN MAKE THE INDIVIDUAL CONFORM TO THE GOAL
IF ANY OF YOU LIKE THIS LETTER I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PROUD HIGHWAY IT'S A COMPILATION OF LETTERS HST SENT TO ALL SORTS OF NOTABLE PEOPLE

EDIT REMOVED AMAZON LINK BECAUSE BOT TOLD ME SO
AND INDEED THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TO FLOAT WITH THE TIDE OR TO SWIM FOR A GOAL

2 BUT WHY NOT FLOAT IF YOU HAVE NO GOAL

A MAN WHO PROCRASTINATES IN HIS CHOOSING WILL INEVITABLY HAVE HIS CHOICE MADE FOR HIM BY CIRCUMSTANCE

WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR LIFE THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE OFTEN RESULTS IN THE LEAST FULFILLING OUTCOME



NEEDED TO READ THIS
MAYBE I MISSED SOMETHING BUT I THINK HIS POINT ON CONFORMING THE GOAL TO THE INDIVIDUAL OS A BIT WEAK IT DOES MAKE SENSE BUT IT ALSO ASSUMES SOME VERY GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF ONE'S OWN ABILITIES AND CHARACTER

PEOPLE MISJUDGE THEMSELVES ALL THE TIME AND THEIR ABILITIES GROW THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES AND THEIR STRENGTHS MAY BE

I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T TRY TO CHOOSE A GOAL BASED ON YOUR ABILITIES BUT RATHER THAT THE PURPOSE OF LIFE MIGHT BE SO CONFUSING BECAUSE THE OBSCURITY OF A GOAL IS TIED UP WITH CONFUSION ABOUT WHO WE ARE
BY FAR THE BEST POST AND RESPONSES I'VE SEEN ON REDDIN
I CAN NOT UNVOTE THIS OR SHARE IT ENOUGH EVERYBODY COULD BENEFIT IN SOME SMALL OR SIGNIFICANT WAY BY GIVING THIS A FULLY THOUGHT OUT READ THE MAN REALLY WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME

BUT TO ME THE MOST AMAZING PART OF IT IS TO THINK HE WROTE THIS AT AN AGE WHERE MOST OF US ARE STILL FINDING OURSELVES AND ARE MORE WORRIED ABOUT TRIVIAL THINGS HUNTER ALREADY HAD WELL FLESHED OUT IDEA ON WHAT LIFE MEANS AND HOW TO GO ABOUT MAKING THE MOST OUT OF IT

FOR ONCE THE REAL LPT IS IN THE ARTICLE NOT THE COMMENTS EVERYBODY GIVE IT A READ INSTEAD TRYING TO SCRAPE IT TOGETHER FROM THE COMMENTS ITS WORTH IT

BLDR DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ THE SOURCE ARTICLE LETTER WITH AN OPEN MIND

EDIT CORRECTED SOME SPELLING AND WORD PLACEMENT ERRORS
WHAT A GOOD THING TO READ ON A FRIDAY MORNING

THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN THAT NO ONE HAS TO DO SOMETHING HE DOESN T WANT TO DO FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE BUT THEN AGAIN IF THAT S WHAT YOU WIND UP DOING BY ALL MEANS CONVINCE YOURSELF THAT YOU HAD TO DO IT
A GREAT READ
SALLY LOVED FOOTBALL PLAYERS
THIS WAS AN AMAZING READ
THAT WAS REALLY POWERFUL
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED TODAY THANK YOU
ABSOLUTELY A GREAT READ THE STRUGGLE TO BE YOU IS REAL I ALSO DIG TWAINS QUOTE ABOUT THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT DAYS OF YOUR LIFE KIND OF PUTS YOU IN THAT PLACE OF AWE ABOUT THIS DRIPPY ASS LIFE WE LIVE
FLOAT OR SWIM YOU DECIDE OR IT WILL BE CHOSEN FOR YOU
I LOVE THOMPSON AND HIS STYLE OF BRINGING INFORMATION TO THE HUMAN RACE THIS ARTICLE WAS BEYOND POWERFUL AFTER READING IT I SENT IT TO EVERY ONE OF MY CONTACTS IN MY PHONE
I DID THE SAME READING HE SUGGESTS IN MY TEENS AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I MAY NOT BE RICH BUT I SURE AM HAPPY FOR THE MOST PART NOT THAT THE READING HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT
I ASK YOU THOUGH IN LISTENING TO WHAT I SAY TO REMEMBER THAT ALL ADVICE CAN ONLY BE A PRODUCT OF THE MAN WHO GIVES IT WHAT IS TRUTH TO ONE MAY BE DISASTER TO ANOTHER I DO NOT SEE LIFE THROUGH YOUR EYES NOR YOU THROUGH MINE IF I WERE TO ATTEMPT TO GIVE YOU SPECIFIC ADVICE IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH LIKE THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND



PEOPLE ARE SO QUIT TO JUDGE TO GIVE BLIND ADVICE TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY'D DO IF THEY WERE IN THEIR SHOES EVERYTHING FROM MONEY JOBS RELATIONSHIPS
I'M IN MY MID S AND STILL FIND MYSELF LOST AT THINGS BUT THE ONE THING I'M STARTING TO REALIZE IS HOW NAIVE AND IGNORANT WE ARE OUTSIDE OUR OWN LITTLE WORLDS IT'S SO EASY TO BLAME SOMEONE ELSE FOR OUR TROUBLES FOR THE POOR ADVICE WHEN WE ARE REALLY THE ONLY ONES TO BLAME
A FRIEND SENT ME THE LETTER SHORTLY AFTER I BROKE UP WITH MY EX IT MADE ME CRY BUT IT MADE ME FEEL CONFIDENCE THAT LIFE WAS GONNA BE BETTER I JUST HAD TO START MAKING DECISIONS
DOPE READ I FEEL LIKE I DO A GOOD JOB OF THIS I LOVE MY LIFE IT'S FREE OF OBLIGATION IT REVOLVES AROUND FREEDOM AND THE CHOICE OF WHAT I WANT TO DO I'VE BEEN BOUNCING AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE AND EXPERIENCING MANY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES OF LIFE IT FEELS REALLY LIBERATING I SEE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES AS ROAD SIGNS POINTING ME TOWARDS ANOTHER DIRECTION AND WHILE I MAY NOT BE MOVING VERY FAST MY PEACE OF MIND LIVES
THIS JUST CHANGED MY LIFE THANKS REDDIN
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HUNTER SOUTH THOMPSON INTERESTING READ VERY SMART AND AWARE MAN FOR A YEAR OLD
SO BASICALLY IT'S ALL ABOUT THE JOURNEY NOT THE DESTINATION

I DIG IT
DAMN I HAVE A WHOLE NEW APPRECIATION FOR HUNTER THIS WHOLE TIME I JUST THOUGHT OF HIM LIKE A DRUGGED OUT DUDE SEEING LIZARD PEOPLE
THIS ARTICLE GETS EVERY MONTH
OUTSTANDING READ THANK YOU

YOU MIGHT WAY TO POST OVER IN R FINDAPATH
THE THUMBNAIL IS MY AVATAR AROUND MOST OF THE INTERNET I JUST GOT REALLY FREAKED OUT FOR A SECOND
IS IT A COINCIDENCE THAT I SAW THIS ON THE SAME DAY I FINALLY PAID OFF MY STUDENT LOANS I THINK NOT
AND IN A SENSE THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE IS THAT WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND THE GOAL AND NOT THE MANUAL
SOMETHING SIMPLE AND EASILY OVER LOOKED
THIS SINGS TO A LOT OF MY PEERS RIGHT NOW SO MANY OF US TRY TO FIND A CAREER INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIND OURSELVES
KIND OF REMINDS OF THAT QUOTE

IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LIFE PLAN CHANCES ARE YOU'LL FALL INTO SOMEONE AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'VE PLANNED FOR YOU NOT MUCH
DECIDE HOW YOU WANT TO LIVE AND THEN SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO TO MAKE A LIVING WITHIN THAT WAY OF LIFE

I THINK MANY OF US WERE TAUGHT TO ACT OPPOSITE OF THIS MYSELF INCLUDED
SO DID HE EVER END UP WRITING A BOOK ABOUT THIS AFTER ALL
THAT WAS GREAT THANKS FOR SHARING
ONE OF THE GREAT MINDS OF OUR GENERATION

RIP
I CHOSE THE LIFE OF DRUGS AND I WAS ABLE TO CHANGE THAT INTO ANOTHER LIFE A SOBER LIFE AND IM HAPPY EITHER WAY SOBER OR DRUGGED SO IN A SENSE I AM NOT ADDICTED I HAVE CONTROL OF WHAT I WANT TO BE AND HOW I WANT TO FEEL
AND HE WROTE IT AGED
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING CONCISE ACCOUNTS OF LIFE I HAVE READ HUNTER SOUTH THOMPSON NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE
DIDN'T STEVE MARTIN COVER THIS TOPIC IN THE JERK
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THAT
THIS IS EXCELLENT
CAN ANYONE HELP ME FIND A FREE PDF OF THE TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN THE LETTER BEING AND NOTHINGNESS EXISTENTIALISM FROM DOSTOEVSKY TO SARTRE

I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HOURS ALL I COULD FIND IS REVIEWS I CAN'T BUY BOOKS ONLINE BECAUSE I LIVE IN A SHITTY COUNTRY

IF IT HELPS BEING AND NOTHINGNESS BY JEAN PAUL SARTRE WAS TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH BY HAZEL EAST BARNES

THANKS
I STOPPED TRYING TO READ IT AS SOON AS THE LIKE US ON FACEBOOK SHIT POPPED UP
CAN'T HELP BUT SEE THE IRONY IN THIS ON MANY INTERVIEWS HE'S SAID THAT HE ULTIMATELY BECAME A WRITER BECAUSE IT'S ALL THAT PAID HIM I WONDER IF HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF AMONG THE COMPANY OF THOSE WHO FEEL THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND IF SO WHAT WOULD HE HAVE PREFERRED TO DO IF ANYTHING FEEL LIKE HE'S FLOATING BUT I CAN'T TELL IF HE EVEN CONSIDERS A QUALITY OF LIFE ANY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF A SWIMMER
I USE THE TERM GOD ONLY KNOWS PURELY AS AN EXPRESSION


I HAVEN'T PICKED UP A THOMPSON BOOK YET WHERE SHOULD I START
YES YES YES
THANK U FOR POSTING THIS I JUST MADE A MAJOR DECISION CHANGE IN MY LIFE AND IT WAS STUPIDLY RELEVANT PUT ME AT EASE ABOUT THE DECISION MADE CAN'T THANK U ENOUGH AS THIS CAME AT THE PERFECT TIME
AFTER FLOATING FOR SO LONG AND MAKING A CHOICE TO SWIM IT'S AMAZING HOW WEAK OUR MUSCLES ARE FROM THEIR LACK OF USE ALSO WHILE SWIMMING IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY THINGS GET IN OUR WAY COMPARED TO WHEN WE WERE JUST FLOATING ALSO AFTER SWIMMING CAN YOU EVER REALLY GO BACK TO FLOATING AGAIN
I STOPPED READING BECAUSE HE SAID WHAT IS SUCCESS TO ONE MAN MIGHT DISASTER TO ANOTHER SO TAKING HIM AT HIS WORD I GUESS
HOLY SHIT MY FEELS
FASCINATING I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THAT NUANCED OF A PERSPECTIVE AT THE AGE OF
I COULDN'T EVEN GET MY HEAD OUT OF MY ASS WHEN I WAS TWENTY LET ALONE THINK FOR MYSELF
THIS WILL FOREVER MAKE FRONT PAGE EVERY MONTHS OR SO
I AM GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE IN LESS THAN A MONTH THIS RESONATED A LOT WHAT A FUCKING TELLER OF TRUTH
I HAVEN'T EVEN READ THE PIECE YET BUT THIS IS SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING COMMENTARY I'VE COME ACROSS ON REDDIN THANKS GUYS
SHOULD BE CROSS POSTED TO R GETMOTIVATED
AGE

WHAT'S HAPPENED TO US
SO PRETTY MUCH A BLESSING IGNORED WILL BECOME A CURSE PAULO
I NEVER HEARD OF HUNTER S THOMPSON BUT I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED READING HIS LETTER
AND THEN HE SHOT HIMSELF
AS A YEAR OLD MAN WHO HAS BEEN A FAN OF HST SINCE MY EARLY S THE THING IN THIS PIECE THAT I PARTICULARLY ENJOY IS THE STRANGE BALANCE BETWEEN HIS INCREDIBLE WISDOM WITH THAT YEAR OLD SWAGGER I LIKE TO THINK THAT THE ELDER HUNTER USED TO LOOK BACK AT THIS AND FEEL A TAD EMBARRASSED WITH HIS OVERLY CONFIDENT EARLY S STYLE YET COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THE OVERALL MESSAGE DAMN I'M GLAD YOU POSTED THIS HST REALLY HELPED ME GET THROUGH THE BUSH YEARS LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO NEED HIS WISDOM FOR THE NEXT FOUR
WHAT A WONDERFUL READ AT A TIME OF UNCERTAINTY
AMAZING LETTER THANK YOU THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH IN MY OWN LIFE LATELY JUST LEFT A WELL PAYING JOB CAREER I ENDED UP HATING AND I WANT TO MOVE INTO WHAT ESSENTIALLY IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE WAY OF LIFE I'M ABOUT TWO STEPS PAST WHERE THE TWO PATHS DIVERGED IN THE WOODS AND IT TAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COURAGE TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT PATH TOWARDS THE UNKNOWN RATHER THAN STAY ON THE SAFE WELL TRODDEN PATH I WAS ON HUNTER IS RIGHT FINDING THE WAY OF LIFE THAT SUITS YOU AND THEN BUILDING YOURSELF UP WITHIN THAT WAY OF LIFE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IS THE PATH TO TRUE HAPPINESS I'M HOPEFULLY HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION ALBEIT SLOWLY AND WITH FALTERING FOOTSTEPS
JUST HAD A REVIEW FOR MY JOB TODAY THEN I SAW THIS SORT OF FEELS LIKE THERE IS A CLEAR DIRECTION TO MOVE IN THANKS HUNTER
HE TALKED ALOT BUT DIDNT SAY A FUCKING THING
ALL AROUND ANSWER FLOATER OR SWIMMER I'M FLOATER BUT SOMETIMES IT IS SHAMEFUL IN THE SOCIETY OF SWIMMERS
ECKHART TOLLE PRETTY MUCH SAID THE SAME EXACT THING IN A NEW EARTH I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT THESE NUGGETS OF WISDOM AREN'T JUST ESOTERIC BUT SO MANY BUDDHISTS ALREADY THINK THE SAME WAY
I READ THE WHOLE LETTER IN JOHNNY VOICE
WEIRD THAT IT GOES STRAIGHT FROM PRETTY GENERIC TYPICAL STATEMENTS INTO EXISTENTIALISM I HAVE A DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY PARTLY BECAUSE OF HIS ADVICE I WANTED TO FIND WHO I WAS EXISTENTIALISM WAS A PRIMARY FOCUS BECAUSE I FIND IT SO INTERESTING SARTRE IS PERSONALLY MY FAVORITE PHILOSOPHER TO CLARIFY THIS IS BECAUSE OF HIS IDENTITY AND SPIRIT RATHER THAN THE SOUNDNESS OF HIS PHILOSOPHY I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME READING BOOKS BY HIM AND THE OTHER RELATED THINKERS CAMUS NIETZSCHE I EVEN OWN A COPY OF EXISTENTIALISM FROM DOSTOEVSKY TO SARTRE BUT WHAT HE'S SAYING REALLY JIBS WITH HESSE HERMANN HESSE WROTE STEPPENWOLF AND SIDDHARTHA AMONG OTHERS BUT THE THEME OF HIS BOOKS IS ALWAYS THE SAME AS SAID IN THE PROLOGUE OF DAMIAN



I WANTED ONLY TO LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROMPTINGS THAT CAME FROM MY TRUE SELF WHY WAS THAT SO VERY DIFFICULT



I REALLY HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED HERMANN HESSE EVEN IF SOMETIMES HE MANAGES TO THROW ME INTO SPIRITUAL TURMOIL HIS WRITING IS STRAIGHTFORWARD HIS CHARACTERS LARGELY RIGID AND ARCHETYPAL IT'S VERY ANGLO-SAXON BUT THE THEMES REALLY DO TRY AND BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN EASTERN AND WESTERN SPIRITUALITY I FIND THAT TOPIC VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE IS ALWAYS SUCH A DIVIDE BETWEEN THE MYSTICISM AND SPIRITUALITY OF TAOISM OR ZEN BUDDHISM AND WESTERN BELIEFS AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE AND CATHOLICISM IT TOOK ME APPROXIMATELY YEARS OF EXPLORING THIS REALM OF THINKING AND SPIRITUALIZING AND READING A TON AND A DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY BEFORE I CAN COMFORTABLY SAY I AM MYSELF AND AM HAPPY MY RELIGION IS THIS MY BELIEFS ARE THIS AUTHENTICITY OF SPIRIT IS VERY CLOSE TO THE CORE OF MY BEING

IT'S NOT SURPRISE THAT HUNTER ALSO TENDED THIS DIRECTION IN HIS YOUTH I LOVE HIS WRITING AND SORELY MISS HIM I WISH HE WAS ALIVE TODAY TO EXCORIATE THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY OR NOT AS THE CASE MAY BE
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT MY PURPOSE IS
FINLAND I WISH I WAS IN FINLAND
MY FAVORITE PART OF READING A YEAR OLD PONTIFICATE ABOUT HOW MUCH HE KNOWS ABOUT LIFE IS DOING IT EVERY 2 MONTHS WHEN THIS GETS REPASTED
JUST FOUND THIS LINK TO PICS OF THE LETTER OR SO IT'S CLAIMED
THOMPSON IS OVERRATED
JESUS HUNTER BLDR
FOR TO GIVE ADVICE TO A MAN WHO ASKS WHAT TO DO WITH HIS LIFE IMPLIES SOMETHING VERY CLOSE TO EGOMANIA TO PRESUME TO POINT A MAN TO THE RIGHT AND ULTIMATE GOAL TO POINT WITH A TREMBLING FINGER IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IS SOMETHING ONLY A FOOL WOULD TAKE UPON HIMSELF

ONE OF THE BEST QUOTES EVER
I I SUPPOSE I SHOULD THANK YOU I USED TO IDOLIZE THE MAN FOR HIS COURAGE NOW I REALIZE THAT HE WAS JUST AN IDIOT I THOUGHT SOMEHOW THAT HE HAD ACCESS TO SOME KIND OF TRUTH THAT I JUST COULDN'T SEE NOW I KNOW THAT HE WAS PROFOUNDLY LOST AND THAT HIS WRITINGS WERE NOTHING MORE THAN THE RAMBLINGS OF A MADMAN

I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR THINKING SOMEONE HAD ACTUALLY FIGURED SHIT OUT

I CAN SEE IT CLEARLY NOW MADNESS MASQUERADING AS TRUTH

I CAN'T BELIEVE I BOUGHT INTO HIS BULLSHIT FOR SO LONG
HIS WORDS ARE POWERFUL DANGEROUS AND RECKLESS
TIME FOR A RE-EVALUATION OF A FEW CORE PRECEPTS I GUESS

THANKS AGAIN SINCERELY
LET'S BE HONEST HERE THE DUDE WAS A DAMN MESS THE ONLY REASON HE BECAME FAMOUS WAS BECAUSE OF THE CULTURE AROUND HIM PUT HIM IN ANY OTHER DECADE AND HE ENDS UP BEING JUST ANOTHER WASH OUT LIVE HOW YOU WANT TO LIVE IS COOL AND ALL UNTIL YOU END UP ALONE IN REHAB
HONESTLY I'M NOT IMPRESSED BY THIS I'M A HUGE HST FAN AND THIS IS FAR FROM HIS ZANY AND SUBVERSIVE BEST
DIDN'T THIS GUY OFF HIMSELF
I GUESS HE REALLY LIKED MAD MAX FURY ROAD
OOOO YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD BE A FIREMAN
SO SEXIST REFERS TO PEOPLE AS MEN UGH HAVE YOU EVEN HEARD OF CAITLIN JENNER OR BERNIE SANDERS TYPICAL WHITE SCUM
THE GOAL IS TO MAKE ONE OF THESE EACH YEAR SO THAT I CAN TRACK MY READING

I STARTED TRACKING ALL THE BOOKS I READ BACK IN ABOUT THE MOTIVATION WAS HEARING AN INTERVIEW WITH ART GARFUNKLE WHERE HE MENTIONED KEEPING SUCH A LIST

I AVERAGE MAYBE 2 BOOKS A WEEK INCLUDING AUDIOBOOKS LONGISH COMMUTE AND I CAN LISTEN TO SOMETHING ABOUT HALF MY WORKDAY

BUT HERE'S THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT A YEAR AGO I SUDDENLY STARTED RECALLING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BOOKS THAT I'D READ BEFORE NOTHING DRAMATIC OR UNUSUAL TRIGGERED THIS RECALL BUT IT WAS ALMOST OVERWHELMING I'D BR DRIFTING OFF TO SLEEP AND START REMEMBERING DOZENS OF BOOKS I'D READ DECADES AGO BACK IN JUNIOR HIGH AND EVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SO I'D HAVE TO TURN ON THE LAMP AND ADD A FEW MORE BOOKS TO MY LIST IN TOTAL I ADDED ABOUT BOOKS TO THE LIST TITLES I HADN'T REMEMBERED IN DECADES SUSAN DARK IS RISING SERIES ANDRE NORTON BOOKS OLD PAPERBACK REPRINTS OF H PAGE HOVERCRAFT AND THE SHADOW

IT WAS AMAZING THAT MY BRAIN COULD SOMEHOW HAVE FILED AWAY SO MUCH INFORMATION THAT I'D FORGOTTEN AND THEN RECALL WITH SUCH VIVID ACCURACY AFTER SO MANY YEARS
I DONT KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I LOVE READING BUT AFTER LIKE THE 2ND 3RD I LOSE INTEREST THEN A FEW WEEKS A MONTH LATER I FIND IT AGAIN
GREAT JOB SOME RANDOM TIPS

THESE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE ALL OF THE CLASSICS IN THE WORLD THEY'RE THE CLASSICS THAT PENGUIN WAS ABLE TO GET PUBLISHING RIGHTS FOR
WHAT AN INTERESTING QUESTION THEY CERTAINLY DO HAVE A LOT ALREADY

FROM WIKIPEDIA
IN PENGUIN BOOKS PUBLISHED A COMPLETE ANNOTATED LISTING OF ALL PENGUIN CLASSICS TITLES IN A SINGLE PAPERBACK VOLUME IN THE STYLE OF ITS PENGUIN CLASSICS BOOKS THE LIST ORGANISES THE COLLECTION MULTIPLE TIMES ALPHABETICALLY BY AUTHOR SUBJECT CATEGORIES AUTHORS BY REGION AND A COMPLETE ALPHABETIC TITLE INDEX THIS COMPILED LISTING INDICATES THERE ARE OVER TITLES AND MORE TO BE PUBLISHED

THE PENGUIN WEBSITE HAS THIS WONDERFUL TOOL SHOWING THE GEOGRAPHIC ORIGINS OF MANY OF THEIR BOOKS LATIN AMERICA AND AFRICA SEEM VERY UNDERREPRESENTED ALTHOUGH SMALLER PUBLISHERS DEDICATED TO PUBLISHING TRANSLATED WORK ARE STARTING TO FILL THOSE GAPS NOW
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING BUT THERE ARE SOME CENTURY ONES THAT I THINK ARE MORE DESERVING THAN SOME THAT ALREADY EXIST

METAMORPHOSIS OR A COMPLETED COLLECTED WORKS OF FRANZ KAFKA THERE SEEMS TO BE A DELUXE VERSION OF THIS BUT NOT A BASIC BLACK SPINE ORANGE TEXT VERSION

ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE

CATCH
I ALWAYS HAVE A MIXED REACTION WHEN READING ABOUT MATH AND SCIENCE PEOPLE TRYING TO GENERALIZE STORIES INTO THESE VARIOUS TYPES LIKE EMOTIONAL ARCS OR TYPE OF CONFLICT

ON THE ONE HAND IT CAN BE AN INTERESTING TOPIC THAT MIGHT BRING UP THINGS ABOUT WRITING WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YET OR EVEN BE A STEPPING STONE TO FINDING A WHOLE NEW WAY TO WRITE

ON THE OTHER HAND BREAKING STORIES DOWN INTO THESE VARIOUS BOXES TO CHECK KIND OF MISSES WHAT IS TO ME THE MOST INTERESTING PART OF THE STORY THE CHARACTERS WHEN I READ A NOVEL MY MAIN POINT OF INTEREST IS WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE WHAT CONFLUENCE OF LIFE EVENTS MADE THEM AS THEY ARE AND WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO NOW WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY DID THEY MATURE IN AND HOW HAS THAT AFFECTED THEIR LIVES

MAYBE THESE AREN'T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IDEAS I DON'T KNOW I WOULD JUST HATE TO SEE PEOPLE MISSING OUT ON HOW SPECIFIC STORIES ARE DIFFERENT JUST BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW SOME SIMILAR PATTERNS
WHAT REALLY SURPRISED ME IS THE BOUGHT BY BOOKCLUBS NUMBER

IST THAT SOMETHING FROM THE UK US ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD

BECAUSE BOOK CLUBS ARE SO NO A THING HERE IN GERMANY FOR EXAMPLE
THAT PART ABOUT DEEP READING WAS UNSETTLING I AM USED TO READING ON AN AND INDEED I'M SKIMMING THROUGH TEXT ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M NOT READING IN MY NATIVE LANGUAGE READING AND REREADING SENTENCES VERY RARELY I FIND MYSELF ENGROSSED IN DEEP READING BECAUSE OF THAT AND BECAUSE OF VARIOUS DISTRACTIONS REGARDING PAGE TURNING WATCHING HOW MUCH IS LEFT OF THE CHAPTER OF THE BOOK WHAT LOCATION I AM WHAT TIME IT IS HOW MUCH BATTERY ETC
ONLY 2 OF BOOK SALES ARE AUDIOBOOKS AS MUCH AS I'VE HEARD ABOUT AUDIOBOOK SALES SURGING IN THE SMARTPHONE ERA I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED HIGHER IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OTHER REPORTS THOUGH
THIS STORY ALICE IN WONDERLAND WAS BANNED IN CHINA AMONGST OTHER COUNTRIES FOR ITS USE OF TALKING ANIMALS DRUG REFERENCES AND PROMOTION OF SEXUAL FANTASIES

LOL WUT HAVE THEY EVEN READ CLASSICAL CHINESE LITERATURE
INTERESTING TO SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN COMPARISON TO THE HOURS SPENT PER WEEK READING TOO NOW IT WOULD BE OBSOLETE TO SAY THAT COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA AND CHINA AREN'T DEVELOPED HOWEVER IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT IN PLACES LIKE JAPAN WHERE CHILDREN ARE CONTINUOUSLY GROWING UP WITH MORE TECHNOLOGY READILY AVAILABLE TO THEM THE HOURS OF READING ARE LOWER COULD BE AN INTERESTING STUDY INTO THIS COOL POST
I'M CONFUSED WHY READING A SCREEN ALWAYS HAS THAT RESULT VS BEING MORE RELATED TO READING ONLINE CONTENT AND EYES DARTING AROUND I HONESTLY NOTICE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN READING ON MY KINDLE AND READING A PAPERBACK
HARDCOVER FOR COLLECTING PAPERBACK FOR HOME PARK OR LIBRARY READING BOOK FOR WORK OR A QUICK NIGHT SHORT STORY OR NONFICTION READ
BOOK I JUMP AROUND BOOKS BUT WHEN I GET INTO ONE IT USUALLY IS A LONG READ SO I GET USED TO THE WEIGHT OF MY KINDLE I JUST LIKE THE COMPACT SIZE AND THE PORTABILITY TOO FOR SO MANY BOOKS I DO MISS BOOK COVERS BUT I JUST TELL MYSELF IT'S WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE THAT COUNTS
HARDCOVER IF AVAILABLE FOR PHYSICAL COPIES BOOK FOR DAY TO DAY READING
BOOK FOR GENERAL READING

PAPERBACK OR HARDCOVER FOR SOMETHING I WANT TO DISPLAY ON MY SHELVES

I BUY MOST THINGS IN BOOKS AT THE MOMENT
BOOKS EXCEPT FOR TECHNICAL STUFF THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN BOOK FORMAT
MY BOOK CONVERSION WAS NOT ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY THOUGH I LIVED FOR A FEW YEARS IN A VERY HUMID REGION MY BOOKS GOT MOLDY AND I HAD TO GET RID OF THEM I WAS PISSED NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THIS BUT ALSO THE MONEY I HAD SPENT SHIPPING THEM THERE NOW I HAVE A VERY LARGE LIBRARY ON MY KINDLE AND DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY OF THAT I STILL LIKE BROWSING BOOKSTORES BUT IF I LIKE SOMETHING I GET THE BOOK
HARDCOVER FOR ME MOSTLY BECAUSE THE FONT SIZE AND PAPER QUALITY IS BETTER I GET ALL MY BOOKS FROM LIBRARY SO MONEY IS NOT A FACTOR FOR ME
BECAUSE I NEVER
ALMOST COMPLETELY AND SOLELY BOOKS IN COMBINATION WITH CALIBRE IT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY FOR STORING BOOKS THAN HARDBACKS OR PAPERBACKS
PAPERBACK ALWAYS FEELS BETTER TO READ
PAPERBACKS FOR LEARNING FOR PLEASURE


I READ A LOT OF TEXTBOOKS WHICH I NORMALLY PREFER TO GET AS AN BOOK OR HARDBACK I JUST PREFER THE WAY I CAN SIT THEM COMPLETELY FLAT ON A TABLE WHILST TAKING NOTES

BUT IF ITS A BOOK I FALL IN LOVE WITH I ALWAYS GO PAPERBACK I CAN'T REMEMBER THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I'VE READ THE MARTIAN BUT THE WEAR ON THE BOOK JUST MAKES IT EVEN MORE SPECIAL TO ME
TRADE PAPERBACK
FICTION ON MY KINDLE AND PHYSICAL COPIES FOR ITS EASIER TO MARK UP AND FLIP TO OTHER SECTIONS TO REFERENCE THINGS I PREFER THE HARDCOVER MOST OF THE TIME
I WOULD SAY PAPERBACK BUT THE CHANCES OF ME CARRYING EITHER MY KINDLE OR MY IPAD YES I DON'T MIND READING ON ONE WITH ME AT ANY GIVEN POINT HAS ME CHOOSING BOOK PURELY FOR CONVENIENCE'S SAKE

I HONESTLY CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I LEFT MY HOME WITHOUT EITHER OF THE 2 DEVICES AND THE FACT THAT I CAN JUST READ ANYTHING ON THERE WITHOUT HAVING TO CARRY MULTIPLE BOOKS WITH ME IS NICE
USED TO BE EITHER PAPER OR HARDBACKS IMMIGRATED AND HAD TO LEAVE MY COLLECTION OF BOOKS THE WEIGHT OF THEM IN REGARDS TO SHIPPING COST WAS JUST TO MUCH SINCE THEN BOOKS EXCLUSIVELY
DEPENDS ON WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

IF IT'S A PENGUIN BOOK IT'S PROBABLY EXCLUSIVELY PAPERBACK LARGELY BECAUSE THE BLACK-BORDERED CLASSICS BOOKS WERE NEVER PRODUCED IN HARDBACK ARE FOUND FOR CHEAP AND ARE A GREAT WAY TO EASILY EXPAND A LIBRARY

IF IT'S A SIGNED BOOK I LOOK EXCLUSIVELY FOR HARDCOVER VERSIONS UNLESS NO OTHER IS AVAILABLE

IF IT'S FOR CERTAIN AUTHORS I LOOK FOR HARDCOVER UNLESS NO OTHER IS AVAILABLE THEN UPGRADE AS NECESSARY I'M TRYING TO GET A HARDCOVER STEPHEN KING COLLECTION GOING BUT I HAVE THREE BOOKS GREEN MILE SERIAL BOSSET DARK TOWER III NEEDFUL THINGS THAT I WANT TO CONVERT INTO HARDBACK IF WHEN I FIND DUPLICATE COPIES

I ALSO HAVE AN BOOK COLLECTION FOR WORKS PUBLIC RELATIONS BOOKS THAT WERE EITHER NEVER RELEASED IN PHYSICAL FORMAT OR WERE ONLY AVAILABLE IN OTHER REGIONS
TYPICALLY HARDBACKS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO LAST LONGER AND LOOK NICER ON MY BOOKSHELF IF IT'S A SERIES I TRY TO HAVE THEM ALL IN THE SAME FORMAT I HAD A KINDLE BEFORE BUT COULDN'T REALLY GET INTO THE BOOK FORMAT SO I GAVE IT TO MY DAD HE LOVES THE THING
I PREFER THE EASE OF BOOKS AND AUDIOBOOKS FOR OTHERS I GO TO MY LIBRARY MY TAXES ALREADY PAID FOR THAT BOOK SO WHY NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEW RELEASES THAT WAY
HARDCOVER FOR HOME DEFENSE AND PRESSING LEAVES PAPERBACK FOR EVERYTHING ELSE I NEVER REALLY GOT INTO THE BOOK THING I'D RATHER HAVE THE PHYSICAL BOOK SO I CAN BEAT IT UP AND DOGEAR THE PAGES AND THE SMELL I LOVE THE SMELL OF BOOKS
I PREFER PAPERBACK SO I'M NOT LUGGING A LOT OF STUFF AROUND BUT I'LL GET A HARDCOVER WHEN I JUST CAN'T WAIT FOR PAPERBACK AND SOMETIMES I'LL GET AN BOOK FOR CONVENIENCE THOUGH I TRY TO AVOID USING SCREENS OUTSIDE OF WORK
I JUST FIND COLLECTIONS OF WORDS PREFERABLY IN COHERENT STRINGS WITH SOME KIND OF CENTRAL THEME IDEA OR CONCEPT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER THAT MUCH IF ITS DIGITAL OR PRINTING

I DO REALLY ENJOY THE TACTILE FEEL OF A REALLY OLD BOOK THOUGH
HARDCOVER THEN PAPERBACK THEN BOOK

I LIKE THE PAPER QUALITY AND HEFT OF HARDCOVERS I ALSO LIKE FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH IN BOOKS SO IF THE PLOT IS MORE COMPLEX BOOKS JUST DON'T DO IT FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD TO FIND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR AND THEN GET BACK TO WHERE I WAS

THAT BEING SAID I USUALLY READ SIX BOOKS AT ONCE INCLUDING ONE ON KINDLE AND ONE ON MY PHONE MY PHONE IS AMAZING FOR WHEN I'M IN THE ELEVATOR I WORK ON THE FLOOR OF A HOSPITAL AND IT CAN TAKE A LOOOOOONG TIME TO GET TO MY OFFICE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT PERSONALLY I DESPISE THAT THERE IS A DEBATE WHEN PEOPLE ARE READING MY ARGUMENT IS THIS I WAKE UP AND STUDY ON THE COMPUTER I PRACTICE LANGUAGES AND COMMUNICATE ON MY PHONE I READ WATCH TV SHOWS AND PLAY GANES ON THE COMPUTER I DO MY WRITING ELECTRONICALLY THE EYE STRAIN OS A LOT AND I HATE WASTING AWAY STARING AT A SCREEN I GET HARDBACKS BECAUSE I LIKE TO REPRIEVE AND REST MY EYES WHILE I DOG EAR PAGES IT ALSO HELPS MY MEMORY MORE WHEN I CAN REMEMBER THAT POSITION OF WORDS OR PHRASES IN A BOOK AS I GO THROUGH IT AND IT IS ENCOURAGING TO ME TO SEE HOW MUCH I CHUNKED OUT I LIKE GETTING NICE EDITIONS OF BOOKS AS WELL BUT I AM ALWAYS ON THE ROAD AND PAYING FOR AN EXTRA SUITCASE OF BOOKS IS INCONVENIENT TO SAY THE LEAST IT IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT WHEN I HAVE COMIC BOOKS BECAUSE THERE ARE MONTHLY ISSUES AND LIMITED ACCESS PLUS IT IS NICE TO SIT DOWN AND ADMIRE THE ARTWORK DIGITALLY READING MAKES MY READING PACE A LOT DIFFERENT AND HARDER TO FLOW ON SOME ISSUES AT THE END IT IS JUST A TRADE OFF AND I AM NOT AGAINST EITHER HOWEVER WHEN I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY I DONT MIND THE TACTILE AND SENSORY EXPERIENCE
USUALLY IF I WANT TO KEEP THE BOOK AS A COLLECTION I TRY HARDCOVER BUT IF TOO EXPENSIVE I GET THE PAPERBACK I DO HOWEVER ALSO DO BOOKS SINCE A LOT OF BOOKS ARE FREE ON THERE AND IT IS EASY TO TAKE ON TRIPS
HARDBACK FOR BOOKS I KNOW I WANT TO KEEP FOR A LONG TIME AND I REREAD SEVERAL TIMES BOOKS FOR NEW BOOKS SUGGESTIONS MOSTLY LIBRARY BOOKS PAPERBACK FOR TEXTBOOKS AND TRADE PAPERBACK FOR TRAIN RIDES AND I HATE MASS MARKET PAPERBACKS SO NEVER THOSE
BOOKS I LOVE TO BROWSE BOOKS IN A LIBRARY HOWEVER

TO ME IT WAS A BURDEN TO HAVE SO MANY PHYSICAL BOOKS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU MOVE I FEEL MUCH FREER AFTER GIVING AWAY MY PHYSICAL BOOKS

I'VE GOT TOO MANY BOOKS ON MY TO READ LIST THAT I'LL PROBABLY NEVER THE OLD ONES


CONS

NEEDS ELECTRICITY
YOU DON'T SEE HOW MUCH OF THE BOOK IS LEFT
NOT FAST WHEN COMPARING TWO PAGES
IT DOESN'T FEEL AS GOOD

PROS

NEEDS NO PHYSICAL SPACE
SEARCHING FOR WORDS
HIGHLIGHTING TAKING NOTES WITHOUT DESTROYING A BOOK
HIGHLIGHTS SYNC ACROSS DEVICES
EASY TO FORWARD QUOTES BY EMAIL
LOOK UP UNKNOWN WORDS
YOU CAN LISTEN TO BOOKS WHILE WALKING IPAD
IMPROVE YOUR SPEED READING SKILLS WITH YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS


THE ONLY EXCEPTION FOR ME ARE PHOTO ALBUMS OR OTHER CUSTOM BOOKS


I READ BOOKS MOST OF THE TIME SO I TEND TO HIGHLIGHT A LOT
PAPER BACK FOR EVERYTHING IF I CAN'T FIND IT AND IT SOMETHING SHORT THEN I'LL GET IT ON KINDLE HARDCOVER IS ALMOST NEVER
PAPERBACK FOR SURE I HAVE THE MASS MARKET PAPERBACK EDITION OF SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE AND IT WAS SO CONVENIENT CARRIED IR IN MY COAT POCKET AND WOULD READ IT ON THE TRAIN TO WORK HIGHLY PORTABLE HIGHLY CONVENIENT WILL PROBABLY GET MORE MASS MARKET PAPERBACK
HARDBACK ALWAYS IF I CAN GET THEM AND IT'S NOT HORRENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE ALWAYS HARDBACK FOR TEXTBOOKS

ARE ONLY IF I WANT SOMETHING RIGHT NOW OR I WANT TO TAKE A BUNCH OF BOOKS WITH ME ON HOLIDAY OR SOMETHING
PAPERBACK COMES IN FIRST FOR ME EASY TO HOLD AND CARRY AROUND I USUALLY GET MY FAVORITE BOOKS IN HARDCOVER MAINLY TO LOOK NICE ON A SHELF AND BECAUSE I KNOW THEY'LL HOLD UP LONGER I DO LOVE MY KINDLE THOUGH TOO I'LL READ ON THAT ON MY LUNCH BREAK AT WORK AND WHEN I GO ON VACATION
HARDCOVERS ARE EXPENSIVE ESPECIALLY IF I WANT TO READ IN ENGLISH CAUSE I HAVE TO ORDER THEM I DO LOVE HARDCOVERS A LOT THO SO HARDCOVERS I EXCLUSIVELY ORDER USED ONLINE

PAPERBACKS I'LL EITHER GET USED EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO ARRIVE MORE TATTY CAUSE THEY'RE EASIER TO WEAR AND TEAR BUT I BUY A LOT OF PAPERBACKS NEW THANK GOD FOR BOOKDEPOSITORY

PAPERBACK
2 HARDBACK
ANCIENT SCROLL





























BOOK
HE THROWS SO MUCH INTO THE MIX VICTORIANS CONFUCIANS NANOTECHNOLOGINS HOOLIGANS AND WOULDN'T YOU JUST LOVE TO GET YOUR HANDS ON ONE OF THOSE PRIMERS A RICH WORLD WELL DRAWN ABSORBING CHARACTERS AND ENOUGH ACTION OT KEEP A POOR BOY AWAKE ALL NIGHT
I THINK DIAMOND AGE CAME AT THE WRONG TIME FOR STEPHENSON HE WAS ALREADY POPULAR BUT NOT POPULAR ENOUGH TO REALLY GET INTO THE THINGS HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THERE IS OOOO MUCH IN THE BOOK THAT REALLY DESERVES MORE PAGE SPACE BUT THE BOOK IS ALREADY AT PAGES AND THAT SCARES A LOT OF READERS OFFICIAL

THERE IS A LOT TO TALK ABOUT BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THE CRUX OF THE PRIMER BEING A GOOD EDUCATIONAL TOOL NELL BECOMES WHO SHE IS BECAUSE SHE HAD A PERSON ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE CARING ABOUT HER EDUCATION THE MASS PRODUCED COPY THAT HAD MASS PRODUCED VOCAL INTERACTIONS CREATED ARMY SO IT IS NOT THE PRIMER ITSELF AS MUCH AS IT IS PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT ON THE PART OF THE TEACHER

YOU HAVE SO MANY MORE BOOKS OF HIS TO READ I AM SO JEALOUS
I READ THIS BOOK A YEAR OR TWO AGO AND LOVED IT THE ONE THING THAT I FELT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD WERE THE DRUMMERS WAS THAT WHAT THEY WERE CALLED THE ONES WHO LIVED UNDER THE OCEAN IN THE WEIRD COMMUNE AND JUST SCREWED EACH OTHER SO THE NANTES COULD GET THE RIGHT MIX INTO SOMEONE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THEY SEEMED OUT OF PLACE TO ME BUT I DID STILL LOVE THE BOOK I READ A COUPLE OF HIS OTHER ONES BEFORE THAT ONE AND I HAVE TO SAY I ADORE HIS WORLD-BUILDING
MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT HIS BOOKS IS HOW MUCH DETAIL HE GOES IN TO REGARDING THE SOCIETAL CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES I LOVED HOW HE DESCRIBED HAVING THE FEED IN THEIR HOMES IT'S FISCAL LIMITATIONS OR EVEN WHAT A CHILD LEFT ALONE WITH IT IS CAPABLE OF OR PRONE TO DOING I ALSO LIKED THE MINI BOTS IT JUST SHOWS THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT HE PUTS IN TO EACH THING IN HIS STORIES
I'LL PROBABLY GET A LOT OF FLAK FOR IT BUT I THINK THE BOOK IS OVERRATED AND NOT ONE OF BEST WORKS IT INTRODUCES A LOT OF INTERESTING IDEAS NARRATION CIRCUMSPECT TEACHING OF TURNING MACHINES ETC HOWEVER THE WHOLE STORY JUST DIDN'T COME TOGETHER FOR ME WITH ENTIRE PARTS EAST G MOST OF THE INTERACTION AROUND THE DRUMMERS FEELING LIKE A COMPLETE DISJOINT MESS
IT'S A PITY BECAUSE OTHER NOVELS MAY HAVE LESS IDEAS BUT SOMEHOW FIT TOGETHER BETTER

MAN OH MAN FAVOURITE TIME OF YEAR

SOME GOOD ONES THIS YEAR TOM STANDS OUT ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE ANYTHING QUITE COMPARES TO LAST YEAR

AT THIS ELIZA AND EZRA ROLLED TOGETHER INTO THE ONE GIGGLING SNOWBALL OF FULL-FIGURED COPULATION SCREAMING AND SHOUTING AS THEY PLAYFULLY BIT AND PULLED AT EACH OTHER IN A DANGEROUS AND CLAMOROUS ROLLERCOASTER COIL OF SEXUALLY VIOLENT ROTATION WITH ELIZA S BREASTS ACROSS EZRA S HOWLING MOUTH AND THE PAINED FRENZY OF HIS BULBOUS SALUTATION EXTENUATING HIS EXCITEMENT AS IT WHACKED AND SMACKED ITS WAY INTO EVERY MUSCLE OF ELIZA S BODY EXCEPT FOR THE OTHERWISE CENTRAL ZONE



SAD NOT TO SEE ROCKY FLINTSTONE ON THIS LIST ALTHOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED CONSIDERING HE'D LIKELY TAKE THE AWARDS BY STORM
I MEAN HOW COULD YOU NOT WITH THESE SORTS OF GEMS
THE DUCHESS NIPPLES HARDENED WITH HER FEELING OF FREEDOM AND THEY WERE NOW AS LARGE AS THE THREE INCH RIVETS WHICH HAD HELD THE HULL OF THE FATEFUL TITANIC TOGETHER
SO IS THERE A LIST OF THE BEST
DELETED
I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF THIS GUY STANDING IN AN AIRPORT CUBICLE GETTING A BLOWJOB AND SOMEHOW MANAGING TO CATCH THIS PASSPORT IS THE MAIN CHARACTER STRETCH ARMSTRONG HER ARSE MUST BE HALF A FOOT OFF THE FLOOR HIS MANAGED TO SNATCH A FALLING PASSPORT OUT OF SIX INCHES OF AIR AND TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT IT ALL WHILE STANDING UP GETTING HEAD NOT ONLY ARE HIS ARMS THE LENGTH OF HIS ENTIRE BODY OR MORE HE'S SHOWING SOME IMPRESSIVE DEXTERITY AND COORDINATION EVEN AT A TIME WHEN HE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE THINKING TOO STRAIGHT
I WONDER WHAT THE AUTHORS THINK WHEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES ON THIS LIST
I'M NOT A WRITER BUT I FEEL LIKE I WOULD ERR ON THE SIDE OF LEAVING THINGS TO THE IMAGINATION IF I WERE WRITING ABOUT A FICTIONAL SEXUAL ENCOUNTER NOT OUT OF PRUDISHNESS BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE'S IMAGINATIONS ARE VERY GOOD AT MAKING THINGS SEXY IT'S WHY A WOMAN IN A SWIMSUIT IS OFTEN MORE ENTICING THAN A NAKED WOMAN

I KNOW THERE ARE PROBABLY SPECIFIC GOALS THAT THE WRITER HAS FOR THESE SCENES THAT GO BEYOND JUST MAKING IT STEAMY BUT STILL WE KNOW WHAT THE PHYSICAL ACT OF SEX IS LIKE YOU DON'T NEED TO REMIND US WITH A HAM-FISTED METAPHORICAL
GAYLE FORMAN LEAVE ME

MAN SO THAT ENTIRE BOOK WAS WEIRD TO ME THERE'S SOME MEDIA LITERATURE THAT I UNDERSTAND BETTER NOW THAT I'M A PARENT BUT THIS IS ONE BOOK THAT WAS UTTERLY BEWILDERING TO ME NOW THAT I HAVE KID IT JUST SEEMED LIKE SHE COULD HAVE HIRED A FEW PEOPLE TO HELP WHILE SHE RECOVERED FROM HER SURGERY LEAVING BEHIND HER TWINS AND HUSBAND AND YES I GET THAT HER HEALTH WAS ON THE LINE WITHOUT SAYING WHERE SHE WAS GOING OR WHEN SHE'D BE BACK

AND IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE SEX SCENE S MEANT TO ESTABLISH OR RE-ESTABLISH INTIMACY BETWEEN THE MAIN CHARACTER AND HER HUSBAND WOULD BE A BIT OFF BECAUSE I COULD NEVER GET BEHIND HER REASONS FOR LEAVING AND I HONESTLY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE'D FORGIVE HERALDRY
THE REASON MY FICTION DOESN'T INCLUDE DETAILED SEX SCENES IS BECAUSE SHOULD I EVER BECOME PUBLISHED I HAVE A HORRIBLE FEAR I WOULD END UP NOMINATED FOR ONE THESE AWARDS
THESE ARE GREAT
MAN OH MAN FAVOURITE TIME OF YEAR

SOME GOOD ONES THIS YEAR TOM STANDS OUT ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE ANYTHING QUITE COMPARES TO LAST YEAR

AT THIS ELIZA AND EZRA ROLLED TOGETHER INTO THE ONE GIGGLING SNOWBALL OF FULL-FIGURED COPULATION SCREAMING AND SHOUTING AS THEY PLAYFULLY BIT AND PULLED AT EACH OTHER IN A DANGEROUS AND CLAMOROUS ROLLERCOASTER COIL OF SEXUALLY VIOLENT ROTATION WITH ELIZA S BREASTS ACROSS EZRA S HOWLING MOUTH AND THE PAINED FRENZY OF HIS BULBOUS SALUTATION EXTENUATING HIS EXCITEMENT AS IT WHACKED AND SMACKED ITS WAY INTO EVERY MUSCLE OF ELIZA S BODY EXCEPT FOR THE OTHERWISE CENTRAL ZONE



WOW SO SO WRONG
LOOK EVEN WHEN I WAS A VIRGIN WRITING SMUT I KNEW BETTER THAN TO COMPARE A DICK TO A GEARSTICK GET IT TO GETHER
DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS BUT I'M EXCITED BY WHAT I'M READING I
THIS COULD INCLUDE ANYTHING REALLY
IT SEEMS THAT BOOKS WITH CHARACTERS FOR HEROES USUALLY AREN'T SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE AND KIDS TEND TO LIKE CUTE ANIMALS APPARENTLY

NOT THE BEST ARTICLE I'VE READ TODAY
STILL THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN I CAN HANDLE A BIT OF COCOON CHRYSALIS CONFUSION
NO IT DIDN'T YOU TAKE THAT BACK
DO ALL THE BOOKS I PLAN TO BUY FOR MYSELF COUNT
I HAVE JUST OVER BOOKS ON MY LIST I'M CONSIDERING ADDING THEM ALL TO MY AMAZON WISH LIST FOR PEOPLE TO CHOOSE FROM BUT IT'S BOOKS AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE I WANT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE BOOKS FOR CHRISTMAS
I HAVE A BOOK OF THE MONTH CLUB MEMBERSHIP ON MY LIST I'VE BEEN TRYING IT OUT FOR A COUPLE MONTHS MYSELF AND HAVE REALLY LIKED IT SO FAR I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC BOOKS ON THERE THOUGH I MAY ADD ONE I'M LEANING TOWARD ALEXANDER FIRST NOVEL EDINBURGH BUT NO MORE THAN THAT I'VE HAD TO LEARN SOME RESTRAINT I ALREADY HAVE A BIG EXISTING PILE OF TO GET THROUGH
I'M GONNA GET

THE BASSOON KING BY RAIN WILSON MY BROTHER LIKES DWIGHT SCHUTE
I HAVE A LONG LIST BUT RIGHT NOW I REALLY WANT TO READ THE BOOKS OF BABYLON SERIES BY JOSIAH BANCROFT AND ANY BOOKS BY NEIL CAIMAN
I'VE DROPPED SOME NOT SO SUBTLE HINTS THAT I'M WAITING TO BE GIFTED THE WISE MAN'S FEAR
AFTER READING EVERYTHING BY TIM FERRISS AND LISTENING TO HIS PODCAST RELIGIOUSLY HIS NEW BOOK TOOLS OF TITANS IS AT THE TOP OF MY LIST I LOVE HOW HE MANAGES TO CRAM SO MUCH USEFUL AND ENTERTAINING INFORMATION INTO ANYTHING HE DOES
IT'S NOT ON MY LIST BUT ONE OF THE BEST GIFTS I EVER GOT WAS A COMPLETE SET OF FRANK DUNE SAGA THE ORIGINAL AT THE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COOL AS I LEARN MORE ABOUT IT SPECIFICALLY HOW MUCH IT MUST HAVE COST THE MORE I VALUE IT

ALSO TOTALLY ASKING A FRIEND FOR A WILLIAM GIBSON NOVEL AD I'VE NOTICED HE HAS A FEW OF HIS BOOKS ON HIS SHELF
ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE IS AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC READ I WOULD ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY READ IT
I'M GOING TO START A NEW TRADITION FOR MY OLDEST NEPHEW AND NIECE THEY'RE BOTH REALLY INTO HARRY POTTER NOW AND I'M GONNA START GETTING THEM A COPY OF THE ILLUSTRATED HARRY POTTER BOOKS EVERY YEAR UNTIL THEY HAVE ALL OF THEM SO THIS YEAR THEY'RE BOTH GETTING THE ILLUSTRATED SORCERER'S STONE

I MAY GET THE LUCIFER GRAPHIC NOVELS
THIS YEAR I'VE BEEN DROPPING SOME HINTS FOR A NICE LORD OF THE RINGS BOX SET BESIDES THAT I USUALLY RECEIVE GIFT CARDS TO BOOK STORES SO I'LL START THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO BUY AFTER THE HOLIDAYS

MOST OF MY FRIENDS ARE SCIENCE MAJORS SO I MIGHT GIFT THEM SOME INTERESTING BOOKS ON CHEMISTRY OR PHYSICS ONE FRIEND ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE COSMOS REBOOT SO HE MIGHT ENJOY THE BOOK BY CARL SAGAN
HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE IS A GREAT CHOICE FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR I'D RECOMMEND THE CHARISMA MYTH BY OLIVIA FOX CABANE I'VE BOUGHT BOTH BOOKS FOR MYSELF AND FOR FAMILY IN THE PAST
JERUSALEM BY ALAN MOORE I MIGHT ASK FOR SOME OTHERS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT BOOK IS ENORMOUS SO IT'LL PROBABLY BE MORE THAN ENOUGH

WHAT ABOUT THE GOD OF ALL BOOKS PROMOTING EQUALITY TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD
I DON'T SEE LORD OF THE RINGS ANYWHERE ON THIS LIST
I HAVEN'T BEEN FOND OF THE REASON I JUMP PART OF IT IS THAT IT AT LEAST SUPPOSEDLY IS WRITTEN BY A BOY WITH AUTISM WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I AM AWARE THAT I GET UNCOMFORTABLE WITH BUT TYPICALLY I WOULD SEE THAT AS A CHALLENGE FOR ME TO PUSH THROUGH IT'S ALSO EFFECTIVELY BEEN TRANSLATED TWICE GIVEN THE AUTHOR'S DIFFICULTY COMMUNICATING AND THE AUTHOR BEING JAPANESE SO THAT MAY PLAY INTO MY ISSUE WITH IT

MY MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT THE BOOK DEFINITELY COMES ACROSS TO ME LIKE IT WAS NOT ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY A BOY WITH AUTISM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO HAVE FAR TOO MUCH UNDERSTANDING OF HOW NORMAL PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THINGS IT ALSO HAS THE FEEL OF A CONDESCENDING PARENT TELLING OTHER KIDS HOW TO BEHAVE AROUND HER CHILD I KNOW PEOPLE WITH AUTISM CAN SOMETIMES COME ACROSS AS CONDESCENDING SO I MAY BE MISJUDGING THE BOOK ON ITS TONE
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT THE GREATEST ANTIWAR BOOK EVER WRITTEN
UNINTERNATIONAL THAT'S NOT EVEN A WORD JUST CALL IT DOMESTIC

SVJEK WAS SERIALISED IN A NEWSPAPER AND HASEK WAS VERY SURPRISED IT BECAME SO POPULAR HE BECAME RICH HE WAS ALREADY VERY WELL KNOWN TO THE POLICE AND PUBLIC AND EVEN MORE NOTORIOUS

HE WAS MAKING MONEY IN A VERY NICE FASHION SO STRUNG THE PUBLIC OUT BY NOT FINISHING SVJEK WHILE CONTINUALLY TELLING HIS READERS THAT A CONCLUSION WAS IMMINENT THEY SHOULD HAVE THROWN THE BASTARD IN THE REARS
THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT TOO THOUGH IT'S A BIT OF A SHAME IT'S AN UNFINISHED BOOK TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE MILAN KUNDERA CONSIDERED IT A REALLY IMPORTANT BOOK HE SPOKE OF IT HIGHLY IN HIS BOOK THE ART OF THE NOVEL
ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS OF ALL TIME
WEIRD IT JUST CAME UP ON MY TIMEHOP THAT I FINISHED THE BOOK AROUND THIS DAY A COUPLE YEARS AGO I BECAME INTERESTED IN PICARESQUE NOVELS AND THIS IS ALWAYS ON THE LISTS FOR ONE OF THE BEST
I WAS BROWSING AROUND A BOOKSTORE TODAY IN HOPES OF FINDING A NEW BOOK TO READ AND I FELT A LITTLE OVERWHELMED IN JUST PICKING A RANDOM BOOK OF FICTION I DECIDED TO TAKE A GANDER AT THIS SUB IN HOPES THAT I WOULD BE LED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND LOW AND BEHOLD I STUMBLE UPON THIS CONVERSATION

I HAD GLANCED AT THIS BOOK AS I WAS SEARCHING BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW BOOKS THAT THE STORE HAS THE COVER FACING THE CUSTOMER SO I DECIDED TO PICK UP THE GOOD SOLDIER SVEJK IT'S A PRETTY BIG UNDERTAKING IN REGARDS TO PAGE NUMBER BUT IT'S SOMETHING I THINK I CAN TAKE DOWN EVENTUALLY JUST WANTED TO SAY THANKS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION

WELP THERE GOES THEIR PLAN TO GET A FREE DYLAN PERFORMANCE AT THE AWARD EVENT
AS A FAN OF BOB DYLAN WHO HAS NEVER SEEN HIM LIVE AND NEVER INTENDS TO I WOULD BE HONORED TO PICK UP HIS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PRIZE AND BRING IT TO HIM
THIS KEEPS GETTING WEIRDER
WHERE IS EVERYONE GETTING THAT HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE PRIZE THE ARTICLES STATES THAT HE SENT A PERSONAL LETTER EXPRESSING FEELINGS OF BEING HONORED WHILE HAVING TO DECLINE ATTENDING THE CEREMONY DUE TO PRIOR COMMITMENTS

HE'S BEEN KNOWN TO BE A SOMEWHAT PERSONAL GUY I GET IT BUT I TOTALLY SEE HIM ACCEPTING THE AWARD IN HIS OWN WAY BUT HE'LL DO IT
WHAT CAN BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN PICKING UP A NOBEL PRIZE
ITT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A SUB ABOUT BOOKS CANNOT EVEN READ PARAGRAPHS OF AN ARTICLE

FIRST DYLAN HAS NOT REJECTED THE PRIZE NOR HE IS INTENDED TO DO IT AS FAR AS WE KNOW IF WE BELIEVE WHAT THE ACADEMY SAYS HE EXPRESS THAT HE FEELS HONORED TO RECEIVE SUCH AWARD HE IS JUST NOT ATTENDING TO THE CEREMONY WHICH AS THE ARTICLE SAYS IS UNUSUAL SITUATION BUT NOT EXCEPTIONAL SO HE IS NOT ACTING LIKE A DOUCHE HE IS SIMPLY NOT ATTENDING THE CEREMONY FOR WHATEVER REASON

SECOND THE ACADEMY IS NEITHER CRYING NOR MOANING NOR MAKING A PUBLICITY STUNT THEY ARE SIMPLY MAKING A VERY POLITE ANNOUNCEMENT TO CLARIFY A SITUATION PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING BOMBARDED WITH JOURNALISTS ASKING FOR THE ISSUE

I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE LIKE DRAMA BUT SERIOUSLY THE ONLY DRAMA HERE ARE THE COMMENTS
IN A STATEMENT EXPLAINING HIS DECISION DYLAN SAID UH DUNNE REBEHHMUH WINNA LUFF RO DESSA ATA

EVERYONE'S SAYING HE'S SELFISH FOR NOT GOING TO PICK IT UP DID YOU ACTUALLY READ THE ARTICLE HE SAYS HE HAS A PRIOR COMMITMENT BUT THAT HE FEELS INCREDIBLY HONOURED THIS ISN'T HIM SAYING THAT HE'S TOO GOOD FOR IT IT'S JUST HIM SAYING HE'S NOT GOING TO DROP EVERYTHING JUST TO PICK IT UP IN PERSON

EDIT JESUS REDDIN STOP DOWNVOTING OPINIONS YOU DISAGREE WITH THE COMMENTS ARE A PLACE TO DISCUSSION NOT TO JUST CIRCLEJERK OURSELVES AND DOWNVOTE EVERYONE WHO OFFERS A DIFFERENT OPINION
I BET HE WILL PERFORM SOME JOHN CAGE
CLASSIC DYLAN
THE SUSPENSE ON THIS REALLY HAD ME GOING IT'S GOOD TO FINALLY GET CLARITY ON THIS ISSUE I CAN START GETTING MY EIGHT HOURS AGAIN
WELL I TRY MY BEST
TO BE JUST LIKE I AM
BUT EVERYBODY WANTS YOU
TO BE JUST LIKE THEM
THEY SAY SING WHILE YOU SLAVE AND I JUST GET BORED
I AIN'T GOING TO STOCKHOLM FOR THAT FUCKING AWARD

BOB DYLAN FARM

EDIT EVIDENTLY WRONG SWEDISH CITY

EDIT SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES ARE EVIDENTLY NOT MY GEOGRAPHIC STRONG SUIT
HE CAN'T VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN DECIDING NOT TO AND BEING UNABLE TO COME STOP WITH THE CLICK BAIT BULLSHIT
NOBEL PRIZE COMMITTEE LESSON LEARNED NEVER SUCK UP TO POP CULTURE ICONS FOR PUBLICITY
I LOVE THIS MAN'S SONGS HIS MUSIC SERIOUSLY HAS TOUCHED ME SINCE I WAS A CHILD HE IS A VERY INTERESTING MANUAL NO DOUBT A HERMIT I FINALLY GOT TO SEE HIM LAST WEEK IN COLUMBIA SCOTTISH HE LITERALLY DIDN'T UTTER ONE WORD TO THE AUDIENCE BESIDES THE LYRICS HE SANG DIDN'T EVEN SAY THANK YOU HE SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY IN HIS OWN WORLD THEN ENTIRE PERFORMANCE STILL WASN'T DISAPPOINTED
ACCORDING TO THE SWEDISH ACADEMY'S WEBSITE IF YOU VISIT THE ACADEMY IN STOCKHOLM THEY GAVE YOU COOKIES DYLAN IS MISSING OUT
IF I WERE I MIGHT WANT TO SKIP THE TRAVEL HASSLES AND THE FUSS OF BEING THE CENTER OF ATTENTION AT AN AWARDS CEREMONY LET DYLAN USE HIS REMAINING TIME HOWEVER WANTS TO USE IT

CAN HE DO THE REQUIRED LECTURE BY SKYPE
HE IS ON TOUR AT THE MOMENT AND HE IS A VERY OLD MANUAL GIVE HIM A BREAK
BOB DYLAN DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK AND NEITHER SHOULD WE
MY NEWS SAID THAT THEY RECEIVED A PERSONALIZED LETTER FROM HIM SAYING THAT HE HAD OTHER COMMITMENTS
I'M GLAD HE'S NOT FLYING THERE FUCK YOU IF YOU WANT TO TAKE DYLAN FROM US YOU'LL HAVE TO BE A LITTLE MORE CLEVER THAN THAT
REX MURPHY HAD ONE OF THE BEST COMMENTARIES ON THIS
FOR A GUY WHO BASES HIMSELF ON OPPOSING THE ESTABLISHMENT I CAN SEE HOW BEING AWARDED A HIGH HONOR BY THE ESTABLISHMENT WOULD FEEL HORRIBLE
I THINK DYLAN WINNING FOR LITERATURE IS ONE OF THE DUMBEST THINGS IVE EVER HEARD IT IS SO CLEARLY A PUBLICITY GRAB FOR AN AWARD THAT HAS BEEN DECREASING IN PRESTIGE FOR A WHILE NOW ITS SO FUCKING STUPID I CANT EVEN JUSTIFY IT BY EXPLAINING IT W POLITICS OR ATTENTION GRABBING ITS JUST STUPID
JUST FURTHER EVIDENCE IN MY MIND THAT IF THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE THE PRIZE TO A MUSICIAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEONARD COHEN AT LEAST HE WOULDN'T HAVE MADE SUCH A SHIT SHOW OF THE WHOLE THING
SINCE EVERYONE IS JUST SHITTING ON THE GUY FOR BEING A PRETENTIOUS DICK I THOUGHT I'D GIVE THE REAL REASON WHY HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE HISTORY THE NOBEL COMMITTEE HAS BEEN NOTICEABLY VOCAL ABOUT THEIR DISTASTE FOR AMERICAN WRITERS AND WHAT THEY SEE AS A BUNCH OF UNSOPHISTICATED YANKEES HE'S TELLING THEM TO FUCK OFF FOR A REASON
WHY IS THIS ALLOWED AND THE APPLE THREAD LOCKED
THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO COHEN
IT'S HILARIOUS TO ME THAT THEY WOULD OFFER HIM AN AWARD AND THEN REACT SO NEGATIVELY TOWARD HIS RECEPTION THIS IS CLASSIC BOB DYLAN AND PART OF WHAT HAS ALWAYS MADE HIM SO INTERESTING AND SPECIAL TO HIS FANS THE ACADEMY REACTING THIS WAY IS PRETTY EVIDENT THAT THEY REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE MAN THEY WERE SUPPOSEDLY HONORING
AS ALWAYS ITT LOADS OF PEOPLE COMMENTING WHO KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT THE PRIZE AND THE LOGISTICS BEHIND IT AND ARE BLATANTLY GIVING IN TO CLICKBAIT

NOTHING ABOUT HIM NOT ATTENDING THE CEREMONY IS OUT OF THE ORDINARY THIS HAS HAPPENED SO MANY TIMES IN THE HISTORY NOTHING ABOUT THE LECTURE IS NEW
IS THERE A REASON WHY HE DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT THIS AWARD IS IT NO LONGER A PRESTIGIOUS AWARD
I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IF YOU ACCEPT THE PRICE YOU'RE SEEN IN DIFFERENT LIGHT AND THAT CHANGES PEOPLE
IF HE DIDN'T WANT THE PRIZE WHY DIDN'T HE SAY IT WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED
I'M SURE THIS HAS BEEN SAID HERE ALREADY BUT OOOO MANY MUSIC ELITISTS AND CRITICS WERE TALKING SHIT CONSTANTLY ABOUT HIS RECEIVING THIS AWARD IT'S NO WONDER TO ME AT ALL THAT HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO COLLECT IT IN PERSON
NOTABLE NO SURPRISE

MAANA I'D KILL FOR A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE
HONESTLY NOBEL AWARDS ARE SO CONTROVERSIAL AT THIS POINT IT'S ALMOST TOXIC
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS AND FRANKLY I DISAGREE WITH THOSE WHO SAY THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE WON

I HAVE TWO DEGREES IN ENGLISH AND I HAVE NOTICED THAT MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES DON'T THINK HE DESERVES THIS BECAUSE HE ISN'T A WRITER BUT HE IS HE IS A WRITER IN ALMOST EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD

I FEEL LIKE THE ELITISM THAT COMES FROM THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES LITERARY IS DOING NOTHING BUT HARMING LITERATURE THERE IS A REASON THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THIS AWARD WHICH IS OFTEN ELITES RECOGNIZING OTHER ELITES THERE IS A REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE DON'T READ GREAT LITERATURE ANYMORE AND IT'S PARTIALLY BECAUSE A SMALL FACTION OF PEOPLE MOSTLY ACADEMICS HAVE DECIDED TO STRICTLY DEFINE THE WORD ALMOST TO THE POINT WHERE THE ONLY PEOPLE READING THAT GREAT LITERATURE ARE OTHER WRITERS OR OTHER ACADEMICS

I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LEAN TOWARD THE BROADEST DEFINITION OF LITERATURE ONE THAT IS INCLUSIVE RATHER THAN EXCLUSIVE GOOGLE DEFINES IT AS WRITTEN WORKS ESPECIALLY THOSE CONSIDERED OF SUPERIOR OR LASTING ARTISTIC MERIT I LIKE THIS DEFINITION

AND IF YOU DENY THAT SONG WRITING AND PARTICULARLY HIS LYRICS ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE OF SUPERIOR OR LASTING ARTISTIC MERIT THEN YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION
DYLAN DOESN'T PLAY BY CHOICE HE MADE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL
HE DOESN'T NEED APPROVAL OR RECOGNITION EXCEPT HIS OWN

I'M JEALOUS I WISH I CAN ACT LIKE HIM ONE-DAY

HOW AMAZING WOULD IT BE
I'M WORRIED HE'S SICK THERE ISN'T A PRIOR COMMITMENT OUT THERE THAT COULD KEEP ME FROM COLLECTING MY NOBEL PRIZE
THIS WHOLE CONTROVERSY IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE DYLAN WORK
FIRST PEOPLE ARE PISSED HE GOT THE AWARD NOW PEOPLE ARE PISSED HE DIDN'T GO GET THE AWARD
DYLAN THE ORGANISATION SAID FELT VERY HONOURED AND WISHED HE COULD RECEIVE THE PRIZE PERSONALLY

WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT AMBRITE GUNZ
HIS FRIENDS AND CONTEMPORARIES KEEP DYING I THINK HE MAY VIEW IT AS POOR FORM TO ACCEPT SUCH AN AWARD RIGHT NOW ALSO I THINK HE COULD GIVE A SHIT WHAT ANYBODY THINKS ABOUT HIM
FOR SOMEONE WHO PURPORTEDLY HATES UNDUE ATTENTION HE'S REALLY CREATING A LOT OF HEADLINES
I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH DYLAN OUTSIDE HIS MUSIC HAS HE ALWAYS BEEN A PRETENTIOUS DOUCHE LIKE THIS IF HE DIDN'T WANT THE AWARD HE SHOULD HAVE DECLINED IT HIS SEMI COMMITMENT TO ACCEPTING IT AND GENERAL WEIRDNESS IN THIS WHOLE FIASCO MAKES ME THINK HE IS AN NARCISSISTIC CLOWN WHO THINKS THE WORLD REVOLVES AROUND HIS ASSHOLE
IF BOB DYLAN DIED ON THE PLANE RIDE OVER TO PICK IT UP WOULD CONTINUE JUST ON SCHEDULE OF SHITTINESS
I SUPPORT HIS NOT GOING

THE NOBEL PRIZE AIN'T AS NOBLE AS IT ONCE WAS
FOR THOSE OF YOU UNFAMILIAR WITH BOB DYLAN HE IS THE HONEY BADGER OF CELEBRITIES AS HE TRULY DOES NOT GIVE A FUCK AND DOES WHATEVER HE WANTS ALTHOUGH HE IS WAY PAST RETIREMENT AGE AND HAS MORE MONEY THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY SPEND DYLAN STILL DOES A HUNDRED OF SHOWS A YEAR AND REGULARLY RELEASES NEW MATERIAL WHEN BOB DYLAN WAS CONTACTED BY OLD CROW MEDICINE SHOW TO USE A CHORUS THAT HE WROTE FOR WAGON WHEEL BOB DYLAN DID NOT EVEN REMEMBER WRITING THE SONG IN THE FIRST PLACE EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM THE NEW BASEMENT TAPES INCLUDING MARCUS BEAUTIFUL WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU WAS BASED OFF OF DISCARDED LYRICS THAT DYLAN NEVER FELT WORTH RECORDING BOB LAST PRESS INTERVIEW IN A DECADE WAS WITH AARP THE MAGAZINE THE UNSOLICITED MAGAZINE PEOPLE RECEIVE AFTER THEY REACH WHILE I AM PERSONALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT DYLAN HAS NOT EMBRACED HIS NOBEL PRIZE WITH AS MUCH DEFERENCE AND ENTHUSIASM THAT ONE MIGHT EXPECT I AM NOT THE SLIGHTEST BIT SURPRISED
WHO IS SURPRISED BY THIS HONESTLY
SUCH A BOB DYLAN MOVE
EVERYONE LEAVE BOB DYLAN ALONE HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO YOU
I LOVE BOB FUCK THE NOBEL
IF YOU LISTEN TO THE TIMES ARE CHANGING YOU BASICALLY CAN HEAR THE REASON WHY
HOW MANY ROADS MUST A MAN WALK DOWN NONE THAT LEAD TO SWEDEN APPARENTLY
HE'S AN ASSHOLE

I'VE SEEN HIM TWICE AND BOTH PERFORMANCES STUNK HE ADMITTEDLY PLAYS OBSCURE SONGS THAT NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR BECAUSE HE CAN NORMALLY I WOULD FIND THIS ENJOYABLE AS I LIKE HEARING NEW MUSIC BY LEGENDARY TALENTED ARTISTS BUT HE HAS AN ARROGANCE ABOUT HIM THAT RUINS THIS

A BUDDY OF MINE WORKED AT OUR UNIVERSITY STADIUM CENTER WHERE BOB DYLAN WAS SCHEDULED TO PERFORM PRIOR TO THE SHOW THEY HAD A TEAM MEETING WHERE THEY WERE TOLD DO NOT INTERACT WITH BOB DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH BOB AND CERTAINLY DO NOT TRY TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION WITH BOB I MEAN COME ON ASSHOLE
WHY THE FUCK IS HE GETTING A NOBEL PRIZE
ARE WE SURE HIS HEALTH IS OKAY WHEN PEOPLE GO MIA FOR AWHILE THEY SOMETIMES SHOW BACK UP WITH REPORTS OF BATTLING CANCER
DON'T SIDESHOW US BOB
WHY IS THIS AN ISSUE
HORRIBLE SINGER BUT A GREAT SONGWRITER
HE KNOWS THIS PRIZE IS BULLISH TENSE SOMEBODY GOT TOGETHER AND DECIDED TO PUT IN THE APPLICATION FOR HIM AND TAG HIM WITH THE PRIZE
TIL BOB DYLAN IS STILL ALIVE
MAN WHO CARES IF BOB DYLAN DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE AWARD IT SEEMS A BIT PRETENTIOUS TO GIVE THE AWARD TO HIM AND THEN FREAK OUT WHEN HE DOESN'T CARE IT'S ALMOST LIKE DOING SOMEONE A FAVOUR JUST SO YOU CAN SEE THEIR REACTION AND BOAST ABOUT IT IT'S JUST AN AWARD HE'S AN MAN AND HE OWES NOTHING TO NOBODY
HONESTLY IT'S DISRESPECTFUL DOWNVOTE ME ALL YOU WANT BUT PEOPLE SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIVES WORKING AND NEVER RECEIVE A NOBEL SCIENTISTS IN PARTICULAR SLAVE AWAY IN RELATIVE OBSCURITY IN HOPES OF ONE DAY BEING AWARDED WHAT DYLAN IS REALLY TAKING FOR GRANTED HERE

I'M A HUGE DYLAN FAN AND I KNOW PEOPLE DO THIS KIND OF THING SOMETIMES BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE THAT ANY LESS OF A SPIT IN THE FACE OF THE ACADEMY
HE ACCEPTED I WONDER HOW PRETENTIOUS HIS DECISION WAS TO ACCEPT THOSE BUT NOT A NOBEL
I AM GLAD THE NOBEL PRIZE HAS BECOME A JOKE LATELY
DYLAN SHOULD HAVE READ A FEW OF BOOKS

FEYNMAN DIDN'T WANT THE PRIZE EITHER BUT HE UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY WELL THAT IF HE TRIED TO REJECT IT IT WOULD BE A PUBLICITY STORM THE SIZE AS IF HE JUST TOOK IT SO FEYNMAN ACCEPTED THE AWARD EVEN THOUGH HE HATED THE CONCEPT OF IT
WHAT A FUCKING HIPSTER
THIS REMINDS ME OF ALL THE AWARDS ARNOLD PALMER HAD TO BE PRESENT FOR BET THEY WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO SWITCH SHOES WITH ME AND BE AN AVERAGE GUY
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING
AS EXPECTED
IT SOUNDS TO ME HE'S REJECTED THE NOBEL PRIZE AND THEY'RE NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO DEAL WITH IT
I CAN REALLY SEE THE ARGUMENT THAT COLLECTING THE TROPHY AND CASH WOULD BE POINTLESS THAT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT FOR HIM TO GET THE WORKS HE'S PRODUCED FOR WHICH THE PRIZE WAS AWARDED ALREADY EXIST THE COMMITTEE'S ASSERTION THAT HE DESERVES THE PRIZE IS ALREADY A FACT ALL THAT'S LEFT IS A TROPHY AND A MILLION PLUS TO A PRETTY OLD

E PLUS HE'S ALREADY STATED HE'S HONORED
TIS A SILLY PLACE
CAN SOMEONE GIVE ME A RECAP OF WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT
NOW I AM VERY GLAD BOB DYLAN WON THE NOBEL PRIZE
I BET DYLAN HAS A LONG THOUGHTFUL LIST OF PEOPLE HE WOULD RATHER GIVE HIS PRIZE TO AND HOPEFULLY WILL DO THAT HE'S NOT A SELF INVOLVED GUY IT SEEMS
I THINK JOHNNY MIGHT NEED TO MIX UP ANOTHER BATCH
ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH BOB DYLAN PROBABLY ISN'T ALL THAT SURPRISED I'D BE HAPPY TO GO PICK IT UP FOR HIM THOUGH I WOULD LOVE TO SEE STOCKHOLM
THE WAY THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING LATELY I'D SUGGEST HE JUST LOCK HIMSELF IN HIS HOUSE UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR
IM GLAD IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEYRE GIVING THEMSELVES THE BOB DYLAN AWARD SARTRE TURNED IT DOWN OUTRIGHT
MAYBE INSTEAD THEY COULD GIVE THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE TO AN ACTUAL WRITER SEEING AS THE SONGWRITER THEY CHOSE COULDN'T GIVE LESS OF A SHIT
IS HIS HEALTH ALRIGHT DOES ANYONE KNOW
HAS BOB BEEN DRONE STRIKING COUNTRIES TOO I HEAR THAT'S ONE WAY YOU CAN GET A NOBEL
HE'S OLD GIVE THE GUY A BREAK
OH BOY JUST WHEN I THOUGHT WE CAN TALK ABOUT BOOKS AGAIN WE CAN COMPLAIN SOME MORE ABOUT DYLAN THE AWARD THE NOBEL PRIZE AND ALL THE OTHER STUPID MINUTIAE ABOUT THIS
THE FUNNY THING HERE IS THAT DYLAN IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THAT CHILL HIPPIE SO WHEN HE STANDS A GROUP OF ACADEMIC TYPES LIKE THE NOBEL COMMITTEE THEY JUST LOOK LIKE CHUMPS
THE BLUE BIRDS SING AND THE TOASTER DINGS LIFE GOES ON I TOLD THE MIDGET MAN IN GARDEN SQUARE DONT TREAD ON ME MAN BUT THEY PUT HIM IN JAIL FOR A CRIME THEY COULDNT PROVE AND A SPOTTED COW JUMPED OVER THE MOON WITH A MISSING HOOVE

NO ONE GIVES A SHIT ABOUT BOB DYLAN JUST STOP
FUCKING GOOD LEAVE THE LEGEND ALONE
WHAT A FLAKE
LOL THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS
HE KNOWS THIS AWARD MEANS THEY ARE GOING TO CASH HIM IN SOON HE IS PROBABLY IN HIDING

SHOULD NEVER HAVE MADE THAT DEAL WITH THE DEVIL BOB

APPARENTLY YOU ARE NEXT TO DIE ON THE LIST
I WONDER IF THERE'S ANY LENGTH REQUIREMENT FOR THE LECTURE
PEOPLE WERE SAYING THE ACADEMY WOULDN'T GIVE PYNCHON NOBEL PRIZE BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T COLLECT IT EVEN THOUGH HE DESERVES IT SO MUCH NOW THEY GAVE BOB DYLAN INSTEAD WHO DOES NOT COLLECT IT TOO THIS IS SURREAL TO SAY THE LEAST THE ACADEMY FUCKED UP THIS YEAR ONE SHALL ADMIT
I REALLY HOPE HE GOES
WHAT IF HIS SPEECH IS A NEW SONG
AND THE NOBEL PRIZE IN NOT GIVING A FUCK GOES TO
I AM SORRY I CAN NOT RECEIVE THE PRIZE IN PERSON I AM STUCK INSIDE OF MOBILE WITH THE STOCKHOLM BLUES AGAIN BOB DYLAN
THE HARDEST I'VE EVER LAUGHED WAS AT A COWORKER WHO ASKED WHILE BAD TO THE BONE WAS PLAYING AT WORK THIS IS A BOB DYLAN COVER RIGHT
EDGELORD
BOB DYLAN LOOK ALIKE COULD PICK UP THE PRIZE AND MONEY AND GET AWAY WITH IT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SPEAK JUST DRESS UP LIKE YOU'RE HOMELESS PICK UP THE PRIZE NOD AND LEAVE
THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST PRETENTIOUS THING I'VE EVER HEARD
BUT WILL HE TAKE THE PRIZE S
I THOUGHT BOB DYLAN DIED
IT'S JUST A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF BRAINS LIVING IN HIS WORLD SUCH AN HONOR TO THE COMMON MANUAL AN ANNOYANCE TO BOB DYLAN WHO USED TO BE ONE OF THOSE COMMON MEN I KIND OF GET IT BUT NOT REALLY MAKES ME LIKE HIM A LITTLE LESS THAN BEFORE AND BOY DID I LOVE HIS MUSIC OH WELL FEET OF CLAY AND ALL THAT
DYLAN IS SUCH A PUNK I LOVE IT
I WAS IN THE SKEPTICAL CAMP WHEN DYLAN WON THIS BUT NOW I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THAT HE WON HE'S BASICALLY TELLING THEM TO FUCK OFF IN HIS OWN LITTLE WAY OF COURSE
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE SEEING HIM IN CONCERT ON FRIDAY NIGHT SO IT'S GOOD TO KNOW HE WON'T BE IN STOCKHOLM SEEING HIM LIVE IS ON MY BUCKET LIST
WHAT A JERK
WHAT A HACK HE'S MAKING A SOUR MOUSE HAT ON A TROPHY THRONE AS PIPERS PLAY THEIR SORRY SONG TO TRY AND MAKE THE DREARY THRONGS LEARN TO HEAR AN SEEM EM
LETTERMAN ASKED DYLAN TO BE ONE OF HIS LAST MUSICAL GUESTS AND SHOWED UP OFFER HIM A NOBEL PRIZE AND HE WON'T COME INTERESTING
DID DID WE FORGET TO TELL HIM HE WON
LIKE A BOSS
THE ATLANTIC HAS A PRETTY SPERMY ARTICLE TRASHING HIM FOR BEING A JERK
OH WHAT A SURPRISE
IT MUST BE HARD BEING THAT FUCKING SAVAGE
GOD DAMN IT BOB JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND DONATE IT TO WHEREVER
THEY SHOULD JUST MAIL IT TO HIM PROBLEM SOLVED
AND STI CAZ
SHE SAID AS GREAT AS YOU ARE MAN
YOU'LL NEVER BE GREATER THAN YOURSELF
I TOLD HER I DON'T REALLY CARE
IT'S TOUGH OUT THERE


IS ANYBODY ELSE REALLY WONDERING IF DOB DYLAN IS REALLY THE BEST RECIPIENT OF THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE
FINALLY SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING COOL
SO HE JUST ISN'T GOING FOR THE AWARDS CEREMONY BUT HE HAS UNTIL JUNE 10TH TO GIVE HIS LECTURE
ANYBODY ELSE LOWNEY THINK OF PAUL SHELDON AFTER READING THIS
A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ON HIS SIDE WITH THIS BUT I PERSONALLY THINK HE'S A POMPOUS JERK
SO FUCKING SICK OF THIS DRAMA ALREADY
AT LEAST HE'S KEEPING IT REAL
THIS IS ALL ABOUT PROMOTION THE NOBEL PRIZE HAS BECOME ANOTHER ACADEMY AWARD WHAT A SHAME

SO IT GOES
I STAND BY MY STATEMENT THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AWARDED THE PRIZE TO BEGIN WITH HE DOESN'T WANT IT AND IT COULD HELP A STRUGGLING UNKNOWN PERSON INFINITELY MORE THAN THIS MANUAL

MY HOPE IS THAT HE FORFEITS THE PRIZE AND IT IS AWARDED TO SOMEONE THAT DESERVES IT
THIS IS LIKE THE ROSS AND RACHEL OF LITERARY AWARDS
THE DEVIL DESERVES THE CREDIT SO WHY WOULD DYLAN WANT TO GO
AT THE VERY LEAST I ADMIRE THE MAN'S GALL
SUCH A REBEL
THE PRIZE IS POLITICAL HE'S PROBABLY NOT SO COMFORTABLE WITH THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME
HAHA WHAT A FUCKING BOSS I LOVED HIS REASONING AS WELL I'VE GOT MORE RESPECT FOR BOB
LIVING OFF PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS WAY PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS
IS ANYONE SURPRISED THOUGH BIG MISTAKE TO GIVE DYLAN THE PRIZE
BOB COLLECT THE AWARD AND THE CHECK AND FEED SOME HUNGRY PEOPLE YOU FUCKING CHRISTAN
COME ON BOB GET OVER YOURSELF AND JUST TAKE THE DAMN HONOR FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
REMOVED
IT'S FUNNY HOW EVERYONE THINKS HE'S JUST IGNORING IT I HAVE SEEN HIM IN CONCERT MANY TIMES INCLUDING THE NIGHT IT WAS ANNOUNCED AND AT BOTH DESERT TRIPS FIRST DESERT TRIP SHOW WAS BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND WAS A NORMAL SHOW THE CONCERT THE NIGHT THEY ANNOUNCED IT WAS A VERY UPBEAT DYLAN WHO YOU COULD SAY WAS PRETTY MUCH DOING A LITTLE DANCING WITH THE MICROPHONE STAND AND EVEN PICKED UP THE GUITAR THE 2ND DESERT TRIP AND THE FEW SHOWS I SAW AFTER THAT HE STAYED MORE UPBEAT THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN HIM CLEARLY A MOOD CHANGER IN MY EYES I'VE SEEN HIM OVER TIMES AND ONLY ONE OTHER TIME PLAYED THE GUITAR THAT'S JUST MY 2 CENTS
I WOULDN'T WANT TO GO TO SWEDEN EITHER
YOU'RE YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SPOTLIGHT FOR YEARS EVERY YEAR ONE DAY SOMEBODY FROM SWEDEN SHOWS UP BOB BOB MR DYLAN GUESS WHAT WE'RE PUTTING YOU IN THE SPOTLIGHT

EVEN IF ONLY WANT TO SHAKE HAND TODAY IT'S LIKE HANDSHAKES EVERY SINGLE DAY WHAT IF IT WERE ONLY WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE REALLY CONGRATULATIONS MIGHT START TO BECOME OVERWHELMING OR EVEN WORSE AT LEAST FOR SOME PEOPLE

FOR MOST OF US IT WOULD BE A GREAT EXCEPTIONAL DAY IF FOUR PEOPLE SAID YOU REALLY DID A GREAT JOB DUDE CONGRATULATIONS

IT'S JUST HOW THE WORLD IS
BOB IS THE BEST
TOO BUSY PLAYING SKYRIN
GOOD FOR HIM HE DOESN'T DESERVE IT ANYWAY AND THE FACT THAT HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY JUST UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT WE SHOULDN'T EITHER THE PRIZE FOR LITERATURE HAS BEEN A JOKE FOR DECADES
AAA IM GOOD FAM THANKS THOUGH BYEEEEE
ITT A LOT OF PEOPLE'S OPINIONS ON WHAT BOB DYLAN IS
STUPID AWARD AND HE KNOWS IT
LOL GUYS HE'S ACCEPTING THE AWARD AND SAID HE WAS HONORED TO RECEIVE IT DID NONE OF YOU READ THE LINES OF THE ARTICLE HE SAID HE SIMPLY WILL NOT HAAR THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE IT THE SCHEDULED DAY AND ITS UNUSUAL BUT NOT UNHEARD OF TO SIMPLY RESCHEDULE A CEREMONY
LEAVE THE POOR GUY ALONE HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR STUPID AWARD
ONLY A FOOL IN HERE WOULD THINK THAT HE'S GOT ANYTHING TO PROVE BOB DYLAN THINGS HAVE CHANGED
TO ALL YOU DUMB PEOPLE COMPLAINING WITHOUT READING THE ARTICLE
WHY DOES ANYONE CARE ABOUT THIS
THEY JUST GAVE IT TO HIM SO THEY COULD GET SOME PRESS
NEVER BEEN A BOB DYLAN FAN UNTIL NOW
BOB DYLAN IS A COCK AND HASN'T MADE ANYTHING NOTABLE SINCE WHY IS HE GETTING ANY AWARDS ANYMORE
GOOD FOR HIM THE NOBEL PRIZE ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE IT'S MORE OF A POPULARITY AWARD THAN ANYTHING ELSE I'M SHIT OBAMA WAS AWARDED THE PRIZE AND HE'S DONE MORE HARM TO PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND DRONING PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER US PRESIDENT IN HISTORY
THE NOBEL PRIZE HAS BEEN SORT OF DEVALUED EVER SINCE THEY GAVE OBAMA ONE FOR BEING BLACK
WHO IS THIS BABY DYLAN
THERE'S NO PRESTIGE INVOLVED IN THE AWARD ANYMORE THEY GAVE OBAMA A NOBEL FOR PIECE AND HE'S HAD THOUSANDS KILLED BY DRONE STRIKES INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN
CAN'T WAIT UNTIL NEXT WEEK WHEN HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND AND IS CONTEMPLATING GOING
I WOULDN'T BE VERY EAGER TO COME TO SWEDEN EITHER
I THINK IT'S KIND OF SHITTY HE'S NOT SHOWING UP TSH HE'S COMING OFF LIKE AN ARROGANT PRICK
HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE NOBEL IN THE FIRST PLACE REALLY THOUGH EXCEPT FOR THE SCIENCE AND MEDICINE PRIZES THE REST ARE A JOKE ANYWAY JUST LOOK AT OBAMA HE GOT A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE AND THEN ORDERED THE KILLING OF THOUSANDS
THAT'S GOOD ACTUALLY AS HE HAS DONE LITERALLY NOTHING TO DESERVE A NOBEL PRIZE
LOL I LOVE DYLAN SO MUCH THIS GUY JUST FLOATS ON AIR NOTHING REALLY TOUCHES HIM
REMOVED
WHAT AN ASSHOLE
TAKE IT OFF HIM
THIS IS WHAT MAKES BOB DYLAN A REAL OG IN MY OPINION HE'S THE KIND OF HUMBLE INDIVIDUAL WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ACCOLADES AND OTHER MATERIAL PIECES HE GETS HIS INSPIRATION FROM WITHIN AND DOESN'T CARE TO RECEIVE PRAISE FROM THE OUTSIDE
I LOST ALL RESPECT FOR THE PRIZE WHEN THEY GAVE THE PRIZE BASED ON RACE RATHER THAN MERIT
MAYBE HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN WHAT THE NOBEL COMMITTEE STANDS FOR MAYBE HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE PEOPLE WHO RUN IT
HE'S NOT AN IDIOT
CONSIDER THIS PEACE PRIZES ARE GIVEN TO PERSONS OF INFLUENCE THAT PUSH A CERTAIN AGENDA
NOT EVERYONE IS BEGGING FOR THE NOBEL COMMITTEE'S FAVOR

IF HE DOESN'T WANT IT LETS LEONARD COHEN GETS IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE
DELETED
HIPSTER TO THE END
NOT A DESERVING CANDIDATE
DELETED
BUT WHY THOUGH SEEMS A BIT EGOTISTICAL TO ME

IS THERE A LEGITIMATE REASON
IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF THEY COULD RETRACT THE NOBEL PRIZE AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY DESERVED IT IF THIS WAS SURE MAYBE DYLAN WOULD STAND A CHANCE BUT NOW REALLY SLIM PICKINGS I GUESS
I GET IF HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE COMMITTEE OR DOESN'T THINK THAT MUSICIANS SHOULD RECEIVE THE PRIZE OR WHATEVER MORAL REASON HE CHOOSES FOR NOT ACCEPTING IT IF HE DOES INDEED CHOOSE NOT TO ACCEPT IT BUT AT THE VERY LEAST HE COULD TAKE THE PRIZE MONEY AND DONATE IT TO CHARITY OR SOMETHING I DUNNO
WHAT DON'T THEY HAVE A STARBUCKS THERE
I HAVE TO SAY FROM READING THE COMMENTS IN THIS THREAD IT RATHER PORTRAYS DYLAN AS A HORRIBLE PERSON THAT IS INCREDIBLY UNLIKABLE EVEN THE COMMENTERS THAT SAY THEY ARE HIS FANS DESCRIBE HIM IN A MANNER THAT ISN'T EXACTLY SOMEONE ONE WOULD WANT TO BE A FAN FOR

DYLAN WAS BEFORE MY TIME SO I DON'T HAVE MUCH OF AN OPINION ON HIM BUT IF THE COMMENTERS HERE ARE ANY INDICATION I DON'T THINK I WOULD LIKE HIM VERY MUCH HE SOUNDS RATHER STUCK-UP AND BRATTY
I AGREE WITH BOB IT'S A STUPID REASON TO GET A NOBEL PRIZE
WELL IF HE WENT HE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO LEAVE
IT'S HIS RIGHT TO IGNORE THE NOBEL PRIZE JUST AS MUCH AS IT'S MY RIGHT TO THINK HE'S ACTING LIKE A SPOILED LITTLE CHILD THERE'S IS ABSOLUTELY NO POINT IN BEING THIS ANNOYING ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY IN THESE CYNICAL TIMES PROTESTING ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT A SIMPLE ACT OF GRATITUDE SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WAY HE'S REACTED TO RECEIVING THIS AWARD IT'S AS IF HE DOESN'T FEEL HE DESERVES IT
HE KNOWS THAT HE DOESN'T DESERVE IT
BOB DYLAN FUCKING SUCKS
I'D LOVE IT IF HE SHOWED UP WITH A SONG ABOUT PEACE PRIZE
I'D LOVE IT IF HE SHOWED UP WITH A SONG ABOUT PEACE PRIZE
WHAT AN ASSHOLE
AFTER ALL OBAMA GOT IT ALSO

PRIZES FOR EVERYONE
WHILE I RESPECT DYLAN AS AN ARTIST THIS SEEMS JUST ARROGANT AS HELL I WONDER IF HE HAS A REASON BEYOND BEING BOB MOTHERFUCKING DYLAN
WHAT A DUMBASS
THAT'S FINE BECAUSE NOBODY CARES ABOUT HIM OR HIS MUSIC ANYWAY

THEY JUST HAND OUT AWARDS TO ANYBODY THESE DAYS HUH WHEN IS VANILLA ICE GETTING HIS AWARD HOW ABOUT MY SOCK DRAWER
LAZY FUCK
IT IS THAT DIFFICULT TO FLY THERE AND SAY THANK YOU STOCKHOLM IS A NICE CITY
OOOO HES A COMPLETE TOOL THEN
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE MORE IMPORTANT
COMMENT
IF I GOT A PRIZE I'D DROP EVERYTHING AND COME I THINK HE DOES NOT WANT IT
EVEN HE KNOWS HE DOESN'T DESERVE IT
SCREW YOU BOB PRETENTIOUS TWAT NO NEED TO BE A PRICK ABOUT IT

AS SOMEONE WHO LIKES THE MUSIC BUT DISLIKES THE MAN
WTF I THOUGHT DYLAN WAS DEAD THE HELL IS HE GETTING A NPP FOR
SERIOUSLY A GREAT MOVE ON PART THE NOBEL PRIZE IS A WORTHLESS ELITIST MASTURBATORY GESTURE ESPECIALLY WHEN GIVEN TO MULTIMILLIONAIRES LIKE DYLAN REMEMBER WHEN THEY GAVE THE PEACE PRIZE TO THE GUY WHO WENT ON TO SLAUGHTER THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DYLAN PROBABLY REMEMBERS
WHO THE HELL WANTS TO HAVE HIS NAME SHARED WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZER OBAMA

IF SOMEONE AS VOLATILE AND DIVISIVE AS OBAMA GETS SOME PEACE PRIZE YOU KNOW IT'S A BUNCH OF SHIT

OF COURSE THAT'S PAR FOR COURSE WITH DEMOCRATS CALL SOMETHING THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT IS

EXAMPLES

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

TOLERABLE LEFT
YOU KNOW WHAT FUCK DYLAN GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PRIZE
WHAT A DICKHOLE DYLAN SHOULD PROBABLY GET OVER HIMSELF
I WOULD LIKE TO CIVILLY SAY BOB DYLAN IS AN UNGRATEFUL LITTLE SHIT
REFUSING TO SHOW TO AND COLLECT YOUR NOBEL PEACE PRIZE HOW GRACEFUL FUCK BOB DYLAN WITH A FOOT STREET SIGN POST
HE IS SUCH A BAG
WELL I GUESS HE'S STILL A TOTAL PRICK THEN
BOB DYLAN CAN GO SELF HE HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A LITTLE BITCH WHEN IT COMES TO THIS AWARD HE DOESNT RESPECT IT OR HARISH IT AND HE SHOULD BE STRIPPED FROM IT
REMOVED
IT'S BEEN MANY MANY YEARS SINCE I READ IT BUT I ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THAT BOOK HAD A REALLY GREAT ENDING LIKE DOWN TO THE LAST PAGE
AS A GUY I PROB READ THIS WAY TO EARLY AT SADLY IT WAS THE BEST SEX EDUCATION THAT AI RECEIVED GROWING UP GRANTED THAT I'M GAY SO I DIDNT NEED SCARED STRAIGHT ON THAT BUT IT DID TEACH ME SO MUCH ON THE IMPORTANCE OF WEARING CONDOMS PROPERLY AND CHANGED MY VIEWS ON ABORTION
IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE I READ IT BUT I STILL DISTINCTLY RECALL MANY THINGS FROM IT

I SUSPECT THAT COULD BE THE SIGN OF A GOOD NOVEL
FREE

OVERDRIVE WITH A LIBRARY CARD IS REALLY THE ONLY LEGAL WAY TO GO
LIBRA VOX DOES SOME CLASSICS BUT THEY AREN'T PROFESSIONAL SO QUALITY VARIES
YOUTUBE HAS A TON OF AUDIO BOOKS AND A FAIR CHAIR OF PEOPLE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB AT READING THEIR FAVORITE BOOKS TOO
AMAZON AUDIBLE IS FANTASTIC
I REALLY DO LIKE THE STANDARD BUT I WON'T SAY IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME TALKING ABOUT BOOKS I PREFER BETTER ASIDE FROM THE DARK TOWER SERIES I WOULD SAY THEY ARE IT FANTASTIC THE CHARACTERS AND SETTING WERE SO FANTASTIC I GET THE FEELING OF DREAD AND UNEASE WHENEVER PENNY WISE OR THE BULLY CAN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME SCENES COME UP

FINALLY I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK DIDN'T REALLY HAVE MANY COMPLAINTS ASIDE FROM ONE OF THE SCENES NOT BEING COMPLETELY EXPLAINED
NICK AND STU WERE MY FACS IN THE STANDARD IT IS A GREAT READ ALL THE SHORT STORY BOOKS SKELETON CREW DIFFERENT SEASONS FULL DARK NO STARS NIGHTSHIRT THEY ALL HAVE GREAT STORIES IN THEM TOMMYKNOCKERS WAS A FUN READ LOT IS GREAT I AM FORGETTING SOME OF MY OTHER FAVORITES BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH MATERIAL FROM HIM NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPE CYCLE OF THE WEREWOLF EYES OF THE DRAGON ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THAT ONE IT'S SUCH A GEM AS FOR NEWER STUFF I ENJOYED DUMA KEY
THERE ARE A LOT OF FANS OVER AT R STEPHENKING WHO SWEAR THAT THIS IS HIS BEST BOOK HIS MASTERPIECE I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY AGREE I LOVE THE FIRST HALF OF IT BUT I DON'T THINK THE ENDING IS NEARLY AS SOLID

WHAT BOOKS OF HIS DO I LIKE BETTER THAN THE STAND

IS MY FAVORITE

THE SHINING PET SEMATARY THE LONG WALK REVIVAL MISERY THOSE ARE ALL GREAT TOO

I'D ALSO SUGGEST CHECKING OUT SOME OF HIS SHORT STORIES I THINK THOSE ARE OFTEN A LOT BETTER THAN HIS BOOKS ARE EVENTUAL NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPE FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT SKELETON CREW YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ANY OF THOSE SHORT STORY COLLECTIONS

IT'S SURPRISING TO ME THAT YOU ENJOYED THE DARK TOWER SERIES AND NOT THE STAND SINCE THEY TOUCH ON SO MANY OF THE SAME THEMES AND FANS OF ONE GENERALLY ENJOY THE OTHER IF IT'S JUST HIS WRITING STYLE AND CHARACTER BUILDING THAT DREW YOU IN TRY DOLORES CLAIBORNE AND MISERY IF IT WAS THE SLIGHTLY FANTASTIC SETTING YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE THE REGULATORS AND DESPERATION A READ MY FAVORITE BOOK BY KING IS THE LONG WALK AND I THINK IT GETS A LITTLE MORE RELEVANT EVERY YEAR OF COURSE THE SHINING IS AN OBVIOUS RECOMMENDATION AS IT'S A GREAT PIECE OF STORYTELLING AND IT'S SEQUEL DR SLEEP WAS ENTERTAINING AS WELL IF NOT TERRIBLY MEMORABLE

KING IS A VERY READABLE WRITER BUT HIS BOOKS ARE REALLY UNEVEN IN QUALITY I FIND THAT I FREQUENTLY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AS YOU WITH HIS BOOKS I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THE CHARACTERS SO IT'S HARD TO FEEL THAT SENSE OF IMPENDING DREAD THAT HE'S OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO BUILD BECAUSE I JUST DON'T CARE IF THAT CHARACTER LIVES OR DIES AS LONG AS IT MOVES THE STORY ALONG BUT HIS BOOKS ARE LIKE POPCORN EASY TO MAKE TASTY AND YOU WANT TO KEEP CONSUMING THEM BUT NOT SOMETHING YOU LOOK FOR WHEN YOU WANT A REAL MEAL
I JUST WANT TO ADD THE AT AUDIOBOOKS FOR THE STAND AND IT ARE REALLY GOOD AND ADD A DIFFERENT ELEMENT TO BOOK MIGHT BE THE BEST AUDIOBOOK I LISTENED TO
WHEN I FIRST READ THE STAND I WAS ABOUT AND THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST THING I'D EVER READ I REVISITED EARLIER THIS YEAR JUST BEFORE I TURNED AND I COULDN'T STAND IT THIS TIME AROUND

MY FAVOURITE OUTSIDE OF THE DARK TOWER I LOVE THOSE BOOKS MORE THAN ANYTHING IS EITHER LOT OR NEEDFUL THINGS ALSO LIKED DUMA KEY AND REVIVAL DIDN'T MIND TOYLAND TOO MUCH EITHER
IT'S A GREAT BOOK BUT HAS SOME SIGNIFICANT FLAWS THAT KEEP IT FROM BEING A TRUE MASTERPIECE IMO
I LIKE A LOT OF HIS THE STAND WAS GREAT BUT THE ENDING WAS SUCH A LETDOWN I THINK PET REMASTERY AND MISERY ARE HIS BEST
I'VE FOUND THE STAND TO HAVE A GREAT BEGINNING AND I UNDERSTAND IT TO HAVE A GREAT ENDING BUT ME TRYING TO READ THE MIDDLE SECTION IS LIKE INVADING RUSSIA IN WINTER IT'S WAY TOO VAST AND NOTHING HAPPENS AND I'VE NEVER EVEN MADE IT HALFWAY THROUGH

I KNOW THAT DOESN'T ADD MUCH TO THE DISCUSSION IT'S JUST A LONG TIME DISAPPOINTMENT OF MINE

THE GRAPHIC NOVELS ARE GREAT AT LEAST AS FAR AS I'VE READ WHICH IS ABOUT ONE SECTION FURTHER THAN I'VE READ THE BOOK ITSELF
I'VE BEEN A STEPHEN KING FAN FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES AT THIS POINT IS HIS BEST WORK IT'S FANTASTIC
IT'S BEEN SAID MANY TIMES HERE BUT IT HAS FANTASTIC CHARACTERS I ACTUALLY MISSED THEM WHEN I FINISHED THE BOOK

SAME EXACT EXPERIENCE WITH
THE STAND DEFINITELY ISN'T IN MY TOP FIVE THAT'S FOR SURE IT'S A GOOD BOOK AND I HAVE READ IT A FEW TIMES BUT SOMETHING ABOUT IT WAS JUST EH

MY FAVORITE STEPHEN KING BOOK IS THE TOMMYKNOCKERS AND ONE OF HIS SHORTER STORIES THE LONG WALK
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A QUICK RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLY FROM SOMEONE ABOUT INSOMNIA HAS ANYONE READ IT I'D LIKE TO START IT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS VERY INTERESTING AND I LOVE SK BUT THE BOOK IS A DECENT COMMITMENT
I THINK KING DOES HIS BEST WRITING IN HIS SHORTER WORKS LIKE THE GREEN MILE TOYLAND AND THE LONG WALK I ACTUALLY THINK TOYLAND IS HIS BEST WORK SINCE THE SOUTH I ENJOYED BUT AM GENERALLY SURPRISED AT IT'S REPUTATION I MEAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD AND ALL BUT NOT NECESSARILY EXCEPTIONAL

AS FOR THE DARK TOWER SERIES THE LESS SAID ABOUT THE LAST BOOKS THE BETTER THEY WERE PARTICULARLY THE FINAL BOOK MASSIVELY DISAPPOINTING FOR THOSE WHO HAD READ THE EARLIER BOOKS AS THEY WERE RELEASED
GREAT BOOK HOWEVER LIKE MOST KING I FIND SOME PARTS ARE BETTER THEN THE WHOLE

THE BEGINNING THE JAIL SCENE AND SOME OF THE DREAMS WERE ALL BRILLIANT PIECES OF WRITING

THEN YOU START TO SEE IT AS A WHOLE THE PACING DIPS AND DIVES THE ENDING IS HORRIBLE FINALLY WHO ASKED FOR SOME ODD PAGES OF GOVERNMENT BUILDING NOT ME

WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID IT'S A GREAT PIECE OF WRITING THAT KEPT ME INTRIGUED FOR PAGES
MISERY AND THE SHINING ARE MY FAVORITES MOST OF HIS SHORT STORY BOOKS ARE GREAT TOO
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS
ARE YOU TRICKING EVERYONE INTO DOING YOUR HOMEWORK
WELL IT'S A MOVIE ON NETFLIX IT'S NOT WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR BUT I GUESS YOU MIGHT LIKE THAT
THE SCENE WHERE SCOUT INTERRUPTS THE MOB ABOUT TO STORM THE JAIL AND IS JUST CHATTING INNOCENTLY WITH HER NEIGHBORS AND HAS NO CLUE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN VIOLENCE AGAINST THE PRISONER AND EVEN HER FATHER THAT SCENE MAKES ME CRY
IT'S JUST GOING IF YOU WANT A KEROUAC BOOK WITH MORE ANSWERS CHECK OUT DHARMA BUMS LONESOME TRAVELER
I'D DO THE SAME AS SAL PARADISE IF I COULD ALWAYS GO HOME TO MAMA WHEN I RAN OUT OF MONEY
WHILE I DON'T REMEMBER ANY PARTICULAR DETAILS ABOUT THE BOOK I READ IT ABOUT YEARS AGO I DO RECALL IT WAS AN AWESOME READ
WELL I JUST PICKED UP DUNE AND STARTED RECENTLY
OOH A LIST OF THINGS TO READ YAY

MY RECOMMENDATIONS
FEAR THE SKY TRILOGY BY STEPHEN MOSS
ANCILLARY JUSTICE TRILOGY BY ANNE BECKI
ORYX CRAKE TRILOGY BY MARGARET ATWOOD

MAYBE SOME OF THESE ARE OBVIOUS OR NOT NEW BUT ALL VERY GOOD READS
I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE EXPANSE SERIES
JUST SIGNED UP WITH TOR TO GET THEIR FREE EPUB BOOK A MONTH READING SPIN CURRENTLY ARE THERE ANY OTHER SERVICES LIKE THIS
COOL I'LL NEED SOMETHING AFTER I FINISH THE RED RISING SERIES
LOL I WONDERED WTF WAS UP WITH THIS LIST UNTIL I SAW THE AUTHOR
THE GREATEST SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL OF ALL-TIME IN MY HUMBLE OPINION IS DUNE BY FRANK HERBERT NEXT COMES PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING WRITTEN BY ARTHUR COUNTY CLARKE OLD SCHOOL I KNOW BUT UNBEATABLE DOES ANYONE KNOW IF ANY MORE RECENT SCI-FI NOVELS COME CLOSE WOULD BE INTERESTED TO HEAR PEOPLE'S OPINIONS
THIS ARTICLE HAS TOO MANY FANTASY BOOKS IN IT THE ARTICLE TITLE SAYS SCIENCE FICTION
IGNORING THE SUBJECTIVE FACTOR THAT TASTES VARY AND SO DOES THE FOCUS OF THE READER THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT CAN INDICATE GOOD WRITING EVEN IF THE READER DOESN'T LIKE THE BOOK ITSELF

FIRST IS TIGHT PLOT WORK NO THINGS DONE BY FIAT NO HOLES THAT CAN'T BE WORKED AROUND BY THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE STORY WORLD OR RULES BUILT IN TO THE STORY PREFERABLY THAT PLOT WILL BE COHERENT AS WELL BUT I'VE SEEN NON LINEAR AND CHAOTIC STRUCTURE WHERE THE PLOT WAS STILL VERY SOLID AND TIGHT INVISIBLE MONSTERS BY PALAHNIUK AS AN EXAMPLE

CHARACTERIZATION EACH CHARACTER SHOULD BE CONSISTENT TO THEMSELVES AND THE WORLD THEY'RE IN ANY PROTAGONIST SHOULD BE FLESHED OUT AND MOSTLY COMPLETE IDEALLY THIS SHOULD BE DONE WITH MINIMUM EXPOSITION THOUGH THAT CAN BE A GOOD THING DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S DONE WHAT IS VITAL IS THAT ONCE THE WRITER HAS ESTABLISHED THE PERSONA MOTIVATIONS AND CORE DRIVES THAT THEY BE ADHERED TO UNTIL AND UNLESS THE STORY CHANGES THEM

CHARACTER VS PLOT SOMETIMES ONE OR THE OTHER ISN'T VERY IMPORTANT COMPARED TO THE OTHER THAT'S OKAY BUT MOST OF THE TIME ATTEMPTING TO DO A PURELY CHARACTER BASED STORY WITH LITTLE OR NO PLOT IS GOING TO FAIL WITHOUT SOME FORM OF MOVEMENT IN TIME NO CHARACTER CAN BE MORE THAN A SKETCH IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO IT IN SHORTER NARRATIVE FORMS BUT STILL DIFFICULT

THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE A GREAT PLOT WITH NOTHING MORE THAN NAMES AND PHYSICAL DESCRIPTIONS ISN'T GOING TO WORK YOU HAVE TO TRY TO MAKE AT LEAST ONE CHARACTER THAT'S MORE THAN A VAGUE IDEA FOR THE READER TO ATTACH TO OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST WRITING HISTORY THE SILMARILLION IS MY BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT GREAT CRAFT SUPERB WORLD BUILDING WITH TRULY EPIC PLOTS BUT THE CHARACTERS ARE JUST DRY HISTORIC FIGURES

DIALOGUE IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO ENTIRE NOVELS WITHOUT DIALOGUE BUT IT ISN'T VERY EFFECTIVE AND TAKES SERIOUS PLANNING EVEN IF THAT DIALOGUE IS PURELY INTERNAL ANY VOICE MUST BE DISTINCTIVE IF THERE'S TWO PAGES OF TWO OR MORE CHARACTERS SPEAKING IT'S VERY EASY TO GET LOST UNLESS THERE ARE CUES AS TO WHO IS SPEAKING JUST PUTTING DOWN AND THEN CHARACTER X SAYS BLAH WORKS BUT IT'S LAZY THE BEST WRITING WILL DO IT WHERE THE MANNER OF SPEECH WORD CHOICE OR LACK THEREOF CAN DO THE JOB INSTEAD

WHILE LATRELL K HAMILTON IS A MEDIOCRE OVERALL AUTHOR ONE THING SHE DOES WELL IS MAKING THE CHARACTER VOICES DISTINCT SOMETIMES IT'S JUST LAZY USE OF FRENCH OR USING PET PHRASES BUT IT DOES WORK YOU CAN READ HER LONGEST MOST BORING AND POINTLESS SIX PAGES OF EMPTY CHATTER AND YOU CAN STILL TELL WHO IS SPEAKING AT ANY TIME OKAY THAT'S FAILED FOR A FEW BOOKS HERE AND THERE SINCE SHE HAS A REVOLVING CAST IN THE DOZENS BUT MOSTLY SHE DOES IT NOW IF SHE COULD JUST GET HER PLOT AND PACING DOWN

PACING IT'S HARDER TO PIN DOWN BECAUSE WHAT PACE YOU USE ISN'T SUPER IMPORTANT IT CAN BE END TO END MANIC RACE OR A CAREFUL PLOD OR ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN BUT THE REALLY GOOD WRITERS FIND A WAY TO BALANCE IT OUT THEY'LL USE DIFFERENT PHRASING AND WORD CHOICE TO PUSH THE READER INTO FEELING THE PACE AS WELL JAMES PATTERSON IS MY EXAMPLE OF A TRUE PRO AT PACING YOU NEVER GET BORED FROM ANYTHING TOO SLOW BUT YOU NEVER GET IRRITATED AT TOO MANY THINGS HAPPENING AT ONCE DEAN KOONTZ IS VERY GOOD AT IT TOO HORROR WRITERS AND ACTION SUSPENSE AUTHORS IN GENERAL EITHER LEARN THEIR PACING OR DON'T SELL VERY WELL

THE OTHER BIG ONE IS WORD PLAY I DON'T MEAN JUST THROWING OUT WORDS THAT SOUND PRETTY TOGETHER THOUGH THAT HELPS IT'S A MORE SUBTLE THING THE REALLY GREAT WRITERS CAN USE SINGLE SYLLABLE WORDS LIKE A SCALPEL THEN BLUDGEON YOU WITH A SINGLE SENTENCE THEY USE WORDS TO NOT ONLY TELL A STORY BUT TO MAKE YOU FEEL AND THINK IN WAYS YOU OTHERWISE WOULDN'T THE CAN ALSO PUT A GREAT DEAL OF THEMSELVES INTO THE WORK THAT WAY DOING THAT CAN CONVEY THEIR THOUGHTS TO YOU SO THAT YOU CAN SINK INTO THE BOOK OUTSIDE YOURSELF

IN MY MIND VONNEGUT MAY BE THE BEST AT THAT BUT I THINK HE DID IT LESS THROUGH CRAFT AND MORE JUST BY BEING HIMSELF TWAIN IS PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE OF IT AS CRAFT THOUGH HE COULD USE DIALECT LOCAL COLOR AND MIX IT WITH PRECISE SPEECH TO TRULY PUT HIS THOUGHTS AND IMAGES ING YOUR MIND LOOK AT TOM SAWYER JUST BY THE WAY HE ARRANGES AND CHOOSES WORDS HE SHOWS THIS IMAGE OF LIFE IN THAT ERA THE CHARACTERS THE LAND ITSELF TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT EVEN NOW IT CAN MAKE NEW READERS FEEL NOSTALGIA FOR A TIME THEY'VE NEVER SEEN THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE

BEYOND THOSE BIG ONES IT'S DOWN TO DETAILS HOW THEY USE THE BIG PIECES TO PUT TOGETHER THE END RESULT
I THINK IT'S SUBJECTIVE WHAT WRITING STYLE I MIGHT LIKE ANOTHER MAY NOT FOR ME I LIKE TO CONNECT WITH THE CHARACTERS AND SEE THEM GROW I WANT TO ESCAPE INTO THE BOOK
IF YOU WANT TO WRITE JUST DO IT
DOES IT TAKE THE READER WHERE THEY WANT TO GO SO YOU CAN HAVE ALL FORMS OF STYLES AND EACH CAN BE GOOD IN THEIR OWN WAY IF THEY ACCOMPLISH THAT END

YOU CAN EVEN HAVE BAD WRITING THAT IS STILL GOOD WRITING IF THE READER ENJOYS IT BECAUSE IT MAY BE SO STRONG IN OTHER AREAS CHARACTERS PLOT DIALOGUE ETC THAT THE TECHNICAL ELEMENT OF THE WRITING DOESN'T KILL IT

A REFERENCE FOR ME IS MARCUS AURELIUS VERSUS SENECA BOTH WERE STOIC PHILOSOPHERS BOTH WROTE EXTENSIVELY YET I FIND THE WAY SENECA WRITES TO BE MESMERIZING AND AURELIUS TO BE VERY DRY AND BORING YET AURELIUS IS FAR BETTER KNOWN AND RESPECTED FOR HIS WORKS PROBABLY BECAUSE HE WAS EMPEROR

POINT IS STYLE SPEAKS TO ME AURELIUS SPEAKS TO OTHERS ERGO THEY ARE BOTH GOOD WRITERS WITH DIFFERENT AUDIENCES
BOOKS LIKE ANY ART FORM ARE OBSERVED THROUGH OUR OWN BIAS AND PREFERENCES SO BY ITS VERY NATURE YOU ARE RELEGATED TO A SUBJECTIVE PROCESS IT'S EASY TO DETERMINE WHAT MAKES A BOOK GOOD OR BAD FOR A GIVEN READER BUT ONCE YOU TRY TO EXPAND THAT DETERMINATION BEYOND THE INDIVIDUAL YOU GET INTO TROUBLE

FIRST WHAT CRITERIA IS GOING TO BE USED IS HARD CLEAN PROSE PRIZED THEN HEMINGWAY WOULD RANK HIGH AND FAULKNER LOW IS RICH PROSE AND DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS PREFERRED THEN THE RATINGS WOULD FLIP
BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN START TO RANK BOOKS YOU NEED TO DETERMINE WHAT THE CRITERIA TO RANK AGAINST CONSISTS OF

OKAY BUT LET'S SAY YOU GET A SET OF RESPECTED PEOPLE TO AGREE ON THOSE CRITERIA THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE WAY TO RANK THEM I'VE HAD PRAISE BY THE DEPTH OF MY CHARACTERS FROM ONE PERSON AND CHIDED BY ANOTHER FOR THEM BEING TOO SHALLOW THE BOOK IS THE SAME IT CAN'T BE BOTH BUT IN FACT IT CAN AS OTHER BOOKS READ AND PREFERENCES IN THOSE BOOKS WILL COME INTO PLAY

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS AN ASPIRING AUTHOR IS WHAT APPEALS TO YOU WRITE THE BOOK YOU WANT TO READ MAKE IT THE BEST IT CAN BE THE ONLY AUDIENCE YOU HAVE TO SATISFY IS YOURSELF DO THAT AND MUCH OF THE REST WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF
I FEEL LIKE IT'S PERSONAL OPINION THAT DECIDES IF A BOOK IS WELL WRITTEN I DIDN'T LIKE EITHER OF THOSE BOOKS YOU MENTIONED AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE A BOOK LIKE FIFTY SHADES THAT IS JUST NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE THAT ATROCITY YET IT'S WILDLY POPULAR

A BOOK IS WELL WRITTEN IN MY OPINION IF IT CAN TAKE YOU INTO THAT WORLD THROUGH DESCRIPTION ALONE TAKE THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN FEEL HOW TINY AND CRAMPED HIS CUPBOARD IS IN THE FIRST BOOK AND THE ABILITY TO FEEL AND GROW WITH HIM CONTINUES THROUGH OUT THE SERIES YOU CRY AT THE DEATHS YOU DANCE AT THE VICTORIES YOU SMELL THE BUTTERBEER AND YOU SEE THE TABLES AND LIGHTS IN THE GREAT HALL

A WELL WRITTEN BOOK ALSO HAS A PLOT THAT DRAWS YOU IN FROM THE START IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE STANDING RIGHT THERE WITH THEM THERE ARE A LOT OF WELL WRITTEN BOOKS FOR ALL AGES COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO LOVES TO WRITE SIT DOWN AND READ AND TRY TO BE OBJECTIVE OF BOTH HORRIBLY WRITTEN BOOKS AND BOOKS YOU ENJOY IF YOU LOSE YOURSELF IN THE BOOK YOU MIGHT NEED TO REREAD IT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR DID TO DRAW YOU IN LIKE THAT SEE HOW THEY SPIN THE FABRIC OF THE TALE

HOPE THIS HELPS
AGREED WITH THE ABOVE
FOR ME IT IS WHEN YOU ALMOST FORGET THE WRITING AND IT DOESN'T JUMP YOU OUT OF THE STORY

THINGS LIKE REPEATED PHRASES AND UNIQUE WORDS USED TOO OFTEN WILL USUALLY KICK ME RIGHT OUT OF A STORY

ALSO BELIEVABLE REALISTIC CHARACTERS THAT ARE MULTIFACETED AND HAVE CONSISTENT MOTIVATIONS BEHIND THEIR ACTIONS

PROTAGONISTS THAT ACT THEY DON'T JUST REACT TO THINGS HAPPENING TO THEM THE HUNGER GAMES BOOKS I THINK ARE WRITTEN TERRIBLY FOR THIS REASON

AND FOR ME PERSONALLY IF A WRITER CAN EXPRESS WHAT IT IS TO BE HUMAN WELL I THINK IS A GOOD BOOK NO MATTER HOW OUTLANDISH THE PLOT IF THERE IS THAT COMMON HUMAN ELEMENT EXPRESSED WELL IT REALLY BRINGS HOME THE STORY AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE IAIN BANKS THE BRIDGE IT'S A RATHER CRAZY AND FANCIFUL STORY BUT AT ITS CORE IT IS ALL ABOUT BEING HUMAN VERY POWERFUL
THE SONG OF ICE AND FIRE BOOKS ARE CONSIDERED BY MY TO BE AMAZINGLY WRITTEN

EH ARE WE TALKING PLOT OR PROSE THE PROSE IS PRETTY WEAK AND REPETITIVE THE NARRATIVE IS IMPRESSIVELY COMPLEX THOUGH GETS PROGRESSIVELY MESSIER AS THE BOOKS GO ON YOU CAN TELL HE MAKES IT UP AS HE GOES ALONG
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS FOR ME ARE THE CHARACTERS I CAN DEAL WITH A SUBPAR PLOT AND WORDBUILDING BUT IF I HATE THE CHARACTERS THEN I'M GOING TO HATE THE STORY SHOOT SOME AUTHORS CAN MAKE ME LOVE THAT I HATE THE CHARACTERS AND THAT'S GREAT ALSO SOMETHING VERY WEIRD FOR ME I HATE LONG CHAPTERS I LIKE THEM TO BE NO MORE THAN PAGES THAT WAY I'M ABLE TO FIND GOOD STOPPING POINTS OFTEN THAT MAKES ME WANT TO READ LONGER IF I GET TO THE LAST MIN BEFORE BED AND I'M READING A BOOK WHERE THE AUTHOR KEEPS A CONSISTENT PAGES FOR A CHAPTER IT MAKES ME WANT TO STOP EARLY RATHER THAN HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CHAPTER I HAVE TO BE UP FOR WORK AT ABOUT EVERY DAY AND I WORK DAYS A WEEK GET ABOUT DAY OFF A MONTH SO I'M NOT A FAN OF STAYING UP TOO LATE EVEN WHEN I'M COMPLETELY ENGULFED IN THE STORY
A WELL-WRITTEN BOOK IS A BOOK THAT DOESN'T BORE ME VERY RARE
JON STEWART IS GOD
THE SCENE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST BOOK WITH THE OWL IN THE BARN NIGHTMARES FOR A GOOD WEEK LOL BUT I REALLY ENJOYED THE SERIES AS WELL
I HAVE A HARRY POTTER LIBRARY IN MY HOUSE WITH THE GREATEST CHAIR I HAVE EVER OWNED
THIS IS MY CORNER I'VE BEEN JAMMING MORE AND MORE BOOKS ON THAT TINY SHELF FOR TOO LONG THOUGH
MY USUAL POSITION IS STANDING UP LEANING AGAINST THE WINDOW OF THE TRAIN ON MY COMMUTE AND PACKED BETWEEN OTHER TRAVELLERS I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR COMFORT BUT IT'S STILL THE PLACE WHERE I GET MOST OF MY READING DONE
I ACTUALLY PREFER TO LIE DOWN ON A BED OR COUCH WHILE READING HUNCHING OVER A BOOK IN A CHAIR FOR LONG PERIODS CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE
I WISH I DID I'D LOVE AN ACTUAL EASY CHAIR IN A QUIET NOOK JUST FOR READING WITH GOOD LIGHTING I DO MOST OF MY READING PROPPED UP IN BED LATELY WITH A FOAM WEDGE AND SOME PILLOWS VERY COMFY BUT NOT THE SAME AS AN EASY CHAIR
MOST OF THE TIME I AM ON MY BED ON MY STOMACH WITH MY HANDS HANGING OFF THE BED I WOULD LOVE A QUIET LITTLE CORNER FOR MYSELF BUT DO NOT HAVE THE SPACE FOR THAT AT THE MOMENT


CAT SUN GIANT BEANBAG

I USUALLY JUST SIT ON THE COUCH BED

YOU WILL HEAR JOURNALIST TALKING ABOUT PUTTING A STORY TO BED AS THOUGH THEY'VE CREATED A FINAL TELLING BUT YOU NEVER HEAR HISTORIANS SAYING THIS BECAUSE HISTORY IS ALWAYS CHANGING AND EVOLVING IT IS FLUID AND YEARS AFTER THE RESEARCH WAS COMPLETED ON THE LAST DEFINITIVE HISTORY OF THE STORY IT'S TIME FOR A BRAND-NEW ONE BECAUSE SO MANY MORE THINGS HAVE APPEARED SINCE WE HAVE A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT IN THE NEW INSIGHT INTO WHAT THE AMERICANS EXPERIENCED ON DECEMBER IN PEARL HARBOR AND YEARS TO CONTEMPLATE THE RAMIFICATIONS OF PEARL HARBOR RAMIFICATIONS WHICH CONTINUE TO THIS DAY
