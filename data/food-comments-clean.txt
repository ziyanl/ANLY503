YOU CALL THAT TOAST
NO WAY THAT'S TOAST
AVERAGE FOOD FOR AN AVERAGE VACATION
EVERYTHING IN THIS PICTURE IS SUBPAR
TOAST WITH TERRIBLE BREAD
CHEESE
LOOKS LIKE A ROOM SERVICE BREAKFAST THAT YOU RELUCTANTLY EAT BECAUSE YOU ARE HANGOVER AF AND CAN'T GET YOURSELF TO LEAVE YOUR HOTEL ROOM
THAT IS ONE EGG BACON AND SLICE OF CHEESE ON WHITE BREAD
WHAT IS THIS FACEBOOK
EXPERT ORANGE SLICE PLACEMENT
PUT THE BUTTER ON THE TOAST BREAD BEFORE YOU PUT THE EGGS ON IT
DISAPPOINTED THAT THE ORANGE SLICE DOESN'T LINE UP WITH THE HORIZON
WAS THIS TODAY DAMN WAY TOO COLD TO EAT OUTSIDE HALACHAH
THAT BOAT NEEDS TO WATCH OUT FOR THE LEMONBURG

ALSO THE BACON COUPLE LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE COMFORTABLY LAYING IN BED
DID YOUR FRIEND GET FRIED CHICKENS A COKE
LOOKS LIKE SCHEVENINGEN ALSO IT LOOKS LIKE AN UITSMIJTER
WHAT ARE THOSE EGGS WATCH OUT FOR THE CROCEIN
YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE CHANGED THE ANGLE SO THE SLICE OF FRUIT WAS PEAKING OUT FROM THE HORIZON


SEE HOW YOU LEMON WEDGE DOESN'T MEET UP PERFECTLY WITH HORIZON WOULD NOT BUY
OK FOOD OK VIEW
YOUR VACATION GOING
IF YOU WERE IN FRANCE ONE EGG WOULD BE AN OOPH
NOUMEA
IF ONLY THE SUNNY SIDE WAS UP
ITS NICE YOU CAN SEE THE SUN COMING UP ON THE HORIZON
I THINK THAT'S MY CRUISE SHIP IN THE DISTANCE
THE WAY THAT THE LIQUID IN THE GLASS MATCHES UP WITH THE SEA
I WOULD HAVE MOVED THE GLASS SLIGHTLY BACK OR THE CAMERA A BIT LOWER TO MAKE THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE ORANGE SLICE LINE UP WITH THE HORIZON
PLEASE NOTE THE BACON LOOKS FINE CARRY ON

I'M GLAD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE SLIGHTLY ANNOYED BY THAT ORANGE SLICE NOT LINING UP WITH THE HORIZON AND BY SLIGHTLY I MEAN I CAN'T LOOK AT THIS SHIT NOW
THAT BOAT IS THREE MILES AWAY
THIS LOOKS AWFUL
ITS JUST WATER
I ATE NORMAL BREAKFAST DRANK ORANGE JUICE IN A CHAMPAGNE GLASS ON A BOAT DOLLAR TREE LUXURY RIGHT THERE
LOL LOOKS GOOD ENOUGH TO ME OP EVERYONE IS IN HERE SHITTING ON YOU ACTING LIKE YOU'RE PROCLAIMING THIS AS SOME DELICACY IT'S FUCKING EGGS BACON AND CHEESE ON SOME SLIGHTLY UNDER TOASTED TOAST CALM DOWN PEOPLE
AS I SIT HAVING OATMEAL AND BAD COFFEE IN A DINGY CUBICAL LOCATED IN COLD AND DREARY SAINT LOUIS MISSOURI I KIND OF HATE YOU FOR SHOWING ME THIS
GEEZ ALL THESE PEOPLE NEED TO RELAX OP THIS LOOKS DELICIOUS AND YOUR VACATION LOOKS AWESOME AND I'M EXTREMELY JEALOUS
THAT IS AN EXCELLENT VIEW BUT THAT IS BREAD NOT TOAST
YOU CALL THAT A VIEW THERE'S A CURB BLOCKING YOUR VIEW OF THE BEACH
OOH ITS A LOVELY SCENE AND A DELICIOUS MEAL
I AM OFFENDED THE VIEW IS MORE THAN OKAY YOU TAKE THAT BACK OP
EH LOOKS CLOUDY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE

ANYWAYS BACK TO MY RETAIL JOB
SEAGULL INC
I TRIED TO ORDER TOAST ONCE IN A COATION CAFE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND TILL I SAID FIRE BREAD AND POINTED TO THE OUTDOOR BBQ

THEY MADE ME TOAST FOR MY EGGS COOKED ON THE BBQ BABY
OBLIGATED TO COMMENT BY UNDERNAME
SHARE THAT RECIPE POOPO I NEED THOSE TASTY LITTLE PLEASURE TRIANGLES
AH ONLY MADE ONE SERVING I SEE
I JUST RECENTLY HAVE REALLY GOTTEN INTO INDIAN FOOD I'VE TRIED DIFFERENT PLACES IT'S AMAZING HOW DIFFERENT IN QUALITY AND HOW THINGS ARE COOKED AT THE RESTAURANTS I FOUND ONE I LOVE AND NOW IT'S MINE

THESE LOOK FANTASTIC NICE AND CRISPY
READ THIS AS SOMAS AS IN COOKIES SAW THE PREVIEW PICTURE BUT STILL HAD HOPE
YOU HAVE MY MOUTH SALIVATING NICE JOB
I LITERALLY JUST ATE THESE

NOT YOURS FROM A RESTAURANT IT WAS MY FIRST TIME GOT EXCITED
TRUE STORY SO I STARED WORKING WITH A NEW CO-WORKER WHO WAS YOUNG AND I FELT I NEEDED TO MENTOR HIM FAST FORWARD A FEW WEEKS I INVITE HIM AND HIS FIANCE OVER TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME AND MY FIANCE

SO THEY BRING A DISH OVER THEY'RE FROM KENYA SO THEY CALL IT BAMBUSA WE HAD A BASIC DINNER STUFFED CHICKEN DIRTY RICE VEGETABLES YOU KNOW A CAUCASIAN DINNER I'M THINKING THESE SUMBUSAS ARE LIKE A PASTRY OR RATHER A DESSERT BUT I DIGRESS SO I WAIT TILL AFTER DINNER TO TASTE THEM

THESE THINGS ARE THE BEST THINGS OUR TASTE GODS HAVE BROUGHT TO THIS EARTH NEEDLESS TO SAY I REGULARLY ASK HIS WIFE TO MAKE THEM ON OCCASION
AM I SAMOSA EAT THOSE WITH A SAUCE
I ATE THESE IN NEPAL RUPEES A PIECE FUCKING DELICIOUS
THEY LOOK LIKE BIG PIZZA ROLLS
IS THERE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND A EMPANADA
THOUGHT THESE WERE PIZZA ROLLS AT FIRST GLANCE
THOSE LOOK DISGUSTING
POA JIKONI NIMEENDA ASANTE
UZBEK SAMOSA

WENT TO AN INDIAN GRADUATION PARTY WAS WORTH IT JUST FOR THESE THINGS
IT'S SAMOOOSAS NOT SAMOSAAAS
THESE AMORES ARE TERRIBLE
I'VE EATEN SAMOSAS FOR YEARS HAVING LIVED IN
COLD WET NORTHERN ENGLAND IN FACT I'VE GOT A BAG IN THE FREEZER AFTER A NEIGHBOUR POPPED ROUND COS HER MUM HAD MADE TOO MANY

THEY'RE GORGEOUS AFTER YOU FRY THEM THE LITTLE CRUNCHY BITS BREAK OFF WHEN YOU BITE INTO THEM BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE WILL GO FIRST COS YOU'VE GOT ONE CORNER IN YOUR MOUTH AND YOU HAVE TO SCRAPE UP PASTRY BITS AS YOUR STUFFING MINCED LAMB AND VEG IN YOUR GULLET
THIS IS AMUSING TO SEE I'M FROM INDIA AND I HADNT SEEN SAMOSAS LIKE THIS BEFORE HERE THEY ARE LARGER BUT YEAH IT'S INDIAN SAMOSAS DON'T GET TOO FOUGHT INSTEAD DUE TO THE SPICES AND CHUTNEY SAUCES IT BECOMES THE MOST SAVOURY PART
SHIT I WAS JUST TELLING SOMEONE AT WORK ABOUT THESE I HAD THEM ONCE YEARS AGO WHEN I WORKED AT A DOLLAR STORE RUN BY AN INDIAN WOMAN AND HAVE CRAVED THEM SINCE
I USED TO THINK THESE WERE INDIAN BUT BUT FOUND OUT THEY ARE ALL OVER MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
WEEKEND PLANS CONFIRMED
LOOKS LIKE SPANAKOPITA
FRIED TRIANGLES OM NOM NOM
CONGRATS ON THE MODERN ART HTTPS
I MAKE THESE ALL THE TIME IF ONLY I KNEW THEY COULD MAKE FRONT PAGE
THE SAMOSAS I GET FROM THE LOCAL GIRL SCOUTS LOOK NOTHING LIKE THAT
HM I SEE THESE AREN'T MIMOSAS OR SAMOS
PEOPLE ARE ARGUING ABOUT WHERE ITS FROM BUT EVERYONE SHOULD REALIZE IS MORE COMMON THAN YOU THINK IVE BEEN HAVING IT MY WHOLE LIFE IN JORDAN WE CALL IS A BAMBUSA FILLING IS USUALLY GROUND BEEF OR CHEESE OR VEGETABLES OTHER VARIANTS CAN COVER THE SHAPE THE SHELL TYPE AND THE FILLING BUT WE JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE AND CALL IT A BAMBUSA REGARDLESS LOVE THESE THINGS
LOOKS GREAT WHAT'S IN THEM
HOGG
GOD DAMN THEY LOOK OOOO GOOD
I RESPECT THE WORK THAT GO INTO THESE GREAT JOB
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GIF
THEY LOOK LIKE EXTRA DANK TRIANGULAR PIZZA ROLLS
IF YOU HAVE AN INDIAN RESTAURANT NEAR YOU TRY THEM THERE FIRST HALF OF THE REASON THEY ARE SO GOOD IS BUZ OF THE PASTRY AND THE CHUTNEY WITH IT
I LOVE SAMOSAS

LITERALLY NEVER HEARD OF THESE OR SEEN THEM LOOKS TASTY THO
ALL THEY ARE IS CHOCOLATE GRAHAM CRACKER AND MARSHMALLOW HOW DIFFICULT WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN


PLEASE SEND SOME

FOR AN ALTERNATIVE WE USE TORTILLAS THAT YOU CAN BUY AT SUPERMARKET
THEY TURN OUT PRETTY GOOD
LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE THE TRADER SAMOSAS
I ALWAYS GET CONFUSED BETWEEN THIS AND A MIMOSA
I JUST ATE A COUPLE TODAY
THE TRICK WITH THE DOUGH IS TO ROLL IT AS THIN AS POSSIBLE YOU SHOULD ALMOST BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH IT
I WANT SOME
YUM ATE THESE AT BONNAROO EVERY YEAR
OG PIZZA ROLLS

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS BUT IT LOOKS DELICIOUS
THOSE LOOK FANTASTIC
I'M A SIMPLE MANUAL I SEE SAMOSAS I UNVOTE
I WOULD LITERALLY EAT THAT WHOLE BOWL IN 2 MINUTES
GOING BY THE SHELL IT LOOKS LIKE A HEALTHIER SAMOSA THE TRUTH IS SAMOSA AND HEALTH CAN NEVER BE USED TOGETHER IT JUST DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT
AS A KIKUYU I HUMBLY APPROVE THESE SAMOSAS
DAMN I READ SAMOS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED NOW
GOSH I LOVE THOSE DUMM
LOVE THE MINI TRIANGLE SAMOSAS MY GRANDMA MAKES THEM AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD WITH A NICE HOT SAUCE
HOW

MORE LIKE HOME MADE ORGASMS

EVERY TIME I GO INTO WHOLE FOODS IT APPEARS AS IF NO ONE EVER BUYS THEIR SAMOSAS AT THE BUFFET I ALWAYS FEEL BAD I LIKE SAMOSAS BUT I'M CONVINCED SINCE THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE THAT WHOLE FOODS DOESN'T MAKE GOOD ONES
WOW

PUT THAT ASIDE FOR NOW IT MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT OF SAUCE BUT IT SUFFICIENTLY COVERED ALL OF THE MEAT

NEXT I CUT UP CLOVES OF GARLIC AND ABOUT A TEASPOON OF GINGER DICING THEM FINELY CLEANING THE PAN I USED PREVIOUSLY I PUT IN SOME MORE COCONUT OIL AND ONCE HOT I BROWNED THE GARLIC AND GINGER SLIGHTLY THEN I MIXED THROUGH THE MEAT POURED THE SAUCE OVER IT MIXED IT WELL TURNED DOWN THE HEAT AND THEN LET IT SIMMER FOR A BIT I ALSO FELT LIKE A KICK SO I ADDED IN SOME CHILLI POWDER ABOUT A TEASPOON ROUGHLY SLICED SPRING ONIONS AND MIXED THEM THROUGH LETTING THE HEAT SOFTEN THEM

SERVED ON WHITE RICE

SORRY GUYS I SUCK WITH TYPING UP RECIPES BUT I HOPE IF YOU TRY IT YOU ENJOY IT

THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU'RE DOCTOR MEANT WHEN HE SAID YOU SHOULD EAT MORE VEGGIES
MY ONLY PROBLEM I'VE EVER HAD WITH STUFFED MUSHROOMS IS THAT THEY'RE TOO MUSHROOMY GRANTED I'VE ONLY EVER HAD STORE-BOUGHT OR RESTAURANT COOKED BUT IT JUST SEEMED LIKE THE TASTE OF THE MUSHROOM OVERPOWERED WHAT IT WAS STUFFED WITH
THE BEER IS HOMEMADE TOO
IF I HAVE TO
PLEASE POST A RECIPE PLEASE
POUND DRY BUCATINI PASTA I LIKE IT BC THE HOLE IN THE PASTA ALWAYS GIVES YOU A GOOD BITE
PIECES OF BACON CUT INTO PIECES
SOME FROZEN PEAS
A HANDFUL OF MUSHROOMS NOT TRADITIONAL BUT I LIKE MUSHROOMS IN MY CREAMY PASTAS
2 GARLIC CLOVES CHOPPED
2 LARGE EGGS YOLK
CUP PARMESAN CHEESE GRATED
SALT PEPPER

SAUTE BACON UNTIL CRISPY THEN REMOVE BACON AND SET ASIDE
SAUTE PEAS AND MUSHROOMS IN BACON FAT AND WHEN COOKED ADD GARLIC TO COOK FOR ANOTHER MIN OR TWO SET ASIDE
MIX EGGS CHEESE AND SALT PEPPER TOGETHER SET ASIDE
COOK PASTA IN SUPER SALTY WATER UNTIL AL DENTE DRAIN PUT BACK IN POT AWHILE PASTA IS STILL SUPER HOT ADD ALL YOUR SIDES BACON PEAS MUSHROOMS EGGS CHEESE MIX UNTIL ALL BECOMES CREAMY AND COMBINED
ADD FORK ENJOY THE END


EDIT SOME FORMATTING THEN SAID EFF IT BC I'M EATING
MINUS POINTS FOR PEAS
NICE I ALWAYS USE A MIX OF PECORINO AND PARMIGIANO REGGIANO I LEARNT THIS IN A GREAT LITTLE RESTAURANT IN BERGAMO THE CHEF ALSO TOLD ME THE SECRET TO A GREAT CARBONARA IS IN THE EGGS GOOD FRESH HEALTHY EGGS
NOT KEEN ON THE PEAS BUT I'M JUST HAPPY YOU DIDN'T ADD CREAM
THAT'S AMAZING MINE ALWAYS TURNS OUT TO DRY WHAT DID U DO SO DIFFERENT
WHERE DO YOU GET BUCCATINI FROM
PLEASE STOP MURDERING CARBONARA

CALL IT PASTA WITH PEAS MUSHROOM EGGS AND BACON PEASHROOMARA OR WHATEVER BUT THIS ABUSE TOWARDS CARBONARA ON THIS SUB REALLY MAKES ME SAD
UNDERNAME CHECKS OUT
ZOMBIE BURGER IS THE BEST I LOVE THE WALKING ACHED BURGER

GET OUT OF TOWN EVERYONE KNOWS THE BEST ONE IS THE TRAILER TRASH ZOMBIE COMES WITH FRIED BACON CHEESE CURDS FRIED PICKLES AND RANCH DRESSING DEFINITELY TAKES TIME OFF OF YOUR LIFESPAN BUT OH WELL
I HAVE HEART BURN LOOKING AT THAT LOL
THATS AT BURGER AND LOBSTER ISN'T IT I MEAN YOUR CHOICES MAYBE GIVE IT AWAY A LITTLE BUT DAMN I LOVE THAT PLACE
WEIRD THAT THEY OFFER HALF A BURGER THAT LOOKS LIKE THEY LEGITIMATELY MADE A FULL BURGER AND CUT IT IN HALF
SERVING HALF A BURGER AND LOBSTER SEEMS PRETTY WEIRD TO ME
HOW MUCH DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS COST IN LONDON
BRING ME YOUR FINEST FOOD STUFFED WITH YOUR SECOND FINEST
VERY GOOD SIR
IGNORANCE SPEAKING HERE BUT ISN'T A RARE BURGER BAD FOR YOU I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT BACTERIA THAT'S ON A STEAK DIE OFF EVEN WHEN RARE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE CUT WHILST IN GROUND BEEF IT'S CHURNED AND MIXED THROUGHOUT THE BURGER HENCE YOU HAVE TO PROPERLY COOK IT TO KILL SAID BACTERIA YET IF THAT WERE TRUE HOW CAN A RESTAURANT SERVE THAT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE I KNOW IN CANADA IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A BURGER RARE
WITH WATER WHERE IS YOUR PINT WINE WHISKEY DRINK
I WENT TO BURGER AND LOBSTER A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN I WORKED IN LONDON THE BURGER WAS AMAZING DON'T EAT LOBSTER PERSONALLY
I WENT TO BURGER LOBSTER IN BATH A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND WENT FOR THE BURGER AND LOBSTER THOUGH WE GOT A FULL BURGER AND FULL LOBSTER WAS I THINK

BURGER WAS OK LOBSTER WAS EXCELLENT NEXT TIME WILL JUST HAVE THE LOBSTER


MMMMMM YUMMY BOTH SOUND AMAZING RIGHT NOW
THEY HAVE ONE IN NYC I WENT THE OTHER DAY AND HAD THE BURGER MY HUSBAND HAD A WHOLE LOBSTER AND A BURGER
TIPS IF YOU WANNA AVOID LONG WAITING HOURS COME TO MANCHESTER IF YOU ARE ABLE TO BASICALLY EMPTY DURING WEEKDAYS
I TRY TO UNDERSTAND FANCY COOKS ALWAYS SAY HAVE A REAL HAMBURGER TO HAVE A LITTLE RED IN IT BUT I CAN'T DO IT I CANT
HOLY SHIT HOW DID YOU GET YOUR BURGER COOKED RARE MED RARE THE RAREST I COULD EVER GET WAS MEDIUM AND THIS COST AN ARM AND A LEG WITH HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO EAT OUT IN LONDON

CHEAP US SOUTHERNER WHO SPENT A SEMESTER IN SURREY
I SINCERELY HOPE YOU WERE IN LONDON LONG ENOUGH TO ENJOY SOME OF THE REALLY SPECIAL TASTES ON OFFER THERE

IT WORLD BE A CRYING SHAME IF YOUR HIGHLIGHT MEAL ALTHOUGH IT DOES LOOK DELICIOUS WAS FROM A NATIONWIDE CHAIN ESPECIALLY IN A CITY THAT OFFERS SUCH AN ARRAY OF UNIQUE CREATIVE QUIRKY AND DELECTABLE NOT FORGETTING OFTEN QUITE CHEAP CULINARY TREATS
THAT NEEDS TO BE A THING IN THE US
AND THE GOVERNMENT SAW THE WHOLE THING
RARE ASS BURGER HOPE YOU DIDN'T GET SICK
IT LOOKS TOO RAW FOR ME
RAW
SEND THE BURGER BACK UNDERCOOKED

LOOKS DELICIOUS

EVERY TIME SOMEBODY ADDS ARUGULA ON TOP OF BOLOGNESE AN OLD LADY IN BOLOGNA ITALY HAS A FIT AND DIE

ARE THOSE DANDELION LEAVES
WHAT ARE THE EGGS SITTING ON
GORDON SCRAMBLED EGGS WOULD HAVE CHIVES IN THEM ALONG WITH CREME FRACHE THEY LOOK ALMOST MORE LIKE A THICK SAUCE IF MADE AND COOKED CORRECTLY

I MEAN NO OFFENSE TO GORDON RAMSAY BUT HE DIDN'T INVENT THAT WAY OF COOKING SCRAMBLED EGGS BEST I CAN TELL IT'S A FRENCH TECHNIQUE
WELL WHAT ALL DID YOU GET ON IT
HOW MUCH DID IT COST FOR THIS MAGNIFICENT BEAST
YEAH WITH DENNIS ITS ALL ABOUT LOCATION THE DENNIS IN MY TOWN IS SUPERB ON EVERYTHING THE NEXT TOWN OVER IS ABSOLUTE SHIT

HAVE YOU TRIED PUTTING CHIPS INSIDE THE SANDWICH IT'S PRETTY GOOD AND ADDS A NICE CRUNCH DUNNO IF IT WORKS WITH PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY THOUGH JUST TRIED IT WITH SANDWICHES LIKE TURKEY LETTUCE ETC
AS AN EUROPEAN THIS IS VERY STRANGE TO ME
IS IT AN AMERICAN THING TO ALWAYS COMBINE SOMETHING SWEET WITH SOMETHING SAVOURY
NEEDS A CHEDDAR CHEESE STICK AND A GLASS OF MILK
I HOPE THIS WAS A LAZY DAY MEAL BECAUSE OTHERWISE THIS IS SHIT YES THIS IS GORDON RAMSAY
HOLY CRAP LOOKS LIKE BACON HEAVEN PERFECT

THAT'S BEAUTIFUL MY STOMACH TOTALLY JUST GROWLED LOOKING AT THIS
RECIPE PLEASE
PROBABLY WAS GOOD BUT LOOKS HM
FOR THE RECIPE I HAVE USED
OF BEEF NECK
OF BRISKET
2 BIG CHUNKS OF OXTAIL
2 BONE MARROWS
ONION STUDDED WITH CLOVES
CARROTS AND A FEW TURNIPS
2 LEEKS
POTATOES
GARLIC CLOVES
THYME BAY LEAF AND PEPPERCORNS


FIRST I BROWNED THE BEEF IN THE POT WITH A BIT OF OLIVE OIL I TOOK CARE OF REMOVING THE EXCESS FAT BEFORE HAND
I MADE A SMALL SACK WITH THE GREEN LEAVES OF THE LEEKS SO I CAN PUT THE THYME AND THE BAY LEAVES INSIDE I ADDED WATER TO THE POT IT HAS TO COVER WELL OVER THE MEAT AND THE VEGETABLES
I ADDED THE MIGNON THE PEPPERCORNS THE GARLIC AND MY LITTLE BAG OF HERBS AND LET IT TO SIMMER GENTLY FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS
THEN I ADDED THE CARROTS AND THE TURNIPS I ADDED THEM TOO EARLY HOUR BEFORE THE END OF THE COOKING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
MINS BEFORE THE END OF THE COOKING I ADDED MY CHUNKS OF POTATOES MY LEEKS AND ALSO THE BONE MARROWS I ROUNDED THE BONES WITH SOME STRING SO IT PREVENT THE MARROW TO ESCAPE IN THE BROTH
YOU EAT THAT WITH MUSTARD IN FRANCE WE EAT THE MARROW BY SPREADING IT ON TOASTED BREAD AND PUTTING COARSE SALT ON TOP OF IT ET VOILA
YEAH IT LOOKS LIKE HELL BUT I AM SURE IT WAS DELICIOUS THE CRUDELY CHOPPED CARROTS REALLY SINK YOU NEED TO GET YOUR KNIFE SKILLS ON POINT
THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO A FILIPINO DISH CALLED NILAGANG BAKA WHICH TRANSLATES TO BOILED BEEF WE ALSO SOMETIMES ADD CORN AND BOK CHOY OR SIMILAR ALTERNATIVES
THE SASHIMI IS DEFINITELY JAPANESE AMBERJACK BUT IS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
SALMON TUNA ESCOLAR AND THE ANGLE OF THE 4TH MAKES IT HARD COULD BE PINK SNAPPER OR HAMACHI AMBERJACK HOWEVER IS PROBABLY TALARIA
WHICH RESTAURANT
THIS ACTUALLY MAKES ME HUNGRY
WELL THIS LOOKS HORRIBLE
PROBABLY NOT ACTUALLY YELLOW TAIL CHECK OUT FISH FRAUD
IS IT SPICEY
I LIKE THAT DIP IN THE CENTRE

I REALLY WISH YOU WOULD HAVE POURED THE COKE SO IT WAS ALL FIZZY MAYBE WITH A LITTLE CONDENSATION AND ONE BEAD OF LIQUID CASCADING DOWN THE GLASS BEFORE YOU TOOK THIS PICTURE
BOSTON BEANS NOT SOUTHERN BEANS

THE SAUCE EVEN KINDA LOOKS LIKE A FISHING ROD
THE HALIBUT SERVING SIZE IS NEVER BIG ENOUGH
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ORDER THE HALIBUT WITH RICE AND MIXED GREENS AT A FANCY RESTAURANT WHERE YOU COULD GET JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE BUT MAN THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD
MY MOM MAKES SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT SHE USES TENDERS AND NO BOURBON STILL BOMB THOUGH BUT I BET THAT BOURBON MAKES A DIFFERENCE

WHO ELSE DOES THIS IN TEXAS SALT LICK HAS THE FAMILY STYLE FOR WHICH IS PERFECT ALL YOU CAN EAT AS WELL
I AM IN THE HOSPITAL AND HAVEN'T FOOD OR DRINK IN DAYS YOU'RE KILLING ME
BLUH FUCK ME UP
SALT LICK HAS A FAMILY STYLE MEAL THAT IS ALL YOU CAN EAT IT WAS LIKE FOR TWO DEFINITELY WORTH IT
LOVE ME SOME HUTCHINS BBQ

BY THE WAY IF YOU REALLY WANT TO OUTDO YOURSELF

GO TO FRANCONIA BREWERY ON SATURDAY MORNING FOR THEIR TOUR ALL YOU CAN DRINK BEER
2 DRINK ALL THE BEER
GO A FEW BLOCKS AROUND THE CORNER TO HUTCHINS AND GET THE ALL YOU CAN EAT
EAT ALL THE BARBECUE
ASK YOURSELF WHAT HAVE I DONE
SLEEP IT OFF OVER THE REST OF THE WEEKEND
IS THIS HUTCHINS IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE IT AND I LOVE ME SOME HUTCHINS AS WELL
YOU SHOULD TRY KOREAN BBQ THERE'S A LOT AROUND DALLAS
OH MY WORD THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON WHY I WANT TO VISIT AMERICA BBQ
BET THEY ALSO OWN THE HOSPITAL LOL
I JUST HAD BBQ IN SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA THE REVIEWS WERE OUTSTANDING SO I WAS ANXIOUS TO TRY IT THE BBQ WAS TOUGH AND THE PORTION WAS SMALL HAVING LIVED IN TX I TRY NOT TO COMPARE BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO I MISS THE FOOD THERE
I WOULD PROBABLY PAY BUCKS AND ONLY BE ABLE TO FINISH ONE PLATE
A ROUND TRIP TICKET FROM DETROIT TO DALLAS AMERICAN AIRLINES ENDLESS BBQ

SHIT IM BRINGING BUCKETS ALONG
IS DIRT CHEAP FOR BBQ LET ALONE ALL YOU CAN EAT RAW BRISKET IS ABOUT A POUND A POUND IF YOU'RE GETTING THE DECENT STUFF AFTER IT'S TRIMMED YOU LOSE ABOUT AFTER IT'S COOKED YOUR MEAT WILL USUALLY SHRINK TO A LITTLE OVER HALF ITS WEIGHT SO YOUR COSTS ARE MORE AROUND TO PER POUND YOU ADD ON RENT UTILITIES TAX AND VARIOUS FEES AND YOU'RE PRACTICALLY GIVING IT AWAY

I HAVE TO ASSUME THEN THAT THEY SMOKE IT FOR HOURS THEN COOK IT IN A CAP TO REINTRODUCE MOISTURE INTO THE MEAT AND KEEPING IT FROM SHRINKING THEN FINISHING IT ON A GRILL TO GET THE CRUST BACK ON IT

THEN AGAIN THIS IS TEXAS AND YOU CAN LEGALLY BE SHOT FOR FUCKING UP BBQ SO WHO KNOWS THEY COULD JUST BE SELLING OLD-SCHOOL SMOKED BRISKET IN HIGH VOLUME
ONLY IN OK
THAT LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER THOUGH
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I MISS DEARLY ABOUT TEJAS
I RECKON I COULD PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS IN AN EVENING
OME AMERICA I WANT ALL YOUR FOOD AND LEGAL WEED THAT LOOKS AMAZING ANYONE WANT TO PAY TO MOVE A ENGLISHMAN TO THE US XD
HONESTLY THAT PLATE IS PROBABLY ALL I CAN EAT
TEXAS HERE I COME
ONE OF THE MANY THINGS I MISS ABOUT LIVING IN TEXAS NOT ONLY IS THE BBQ TOP NOT BUT IT'S ALSO REASONABLY PRICED AND THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE NOW THAT I'M LIVING IN LAS VEGAS I'VE YET TO FIND LEGITIMATELY GOOD BBQ THERE'S SOME DECENT PLACES BUT NOTHING AMAZING AND THE PORTIONS ARE TINY AND THE PRICES ARE PREMIUM THAT PLATE HERE WOULD RUN YOU AND IT WOULDN'T BE ALL YOU CAN EAT
UK GUY HERE I WENT TO TEXAS TWICE BOTH TIMES HAD TO GET BACK TO A LOT OF RUNNING AND WORKING OUT WHEN I GOT BACK I LOVE THAT BBQ
WHO EATS SIDES AT BARBECUE
AS A TEXAN THIS IS A NORMAL MEAL FOR ME IF YOU WANT THE BEST BBQ BUFFET IN THE DFW AREA CHECK OUT NORTH MAIN BBQ IN EULESS THE PLACE LOOKS LIKE A SHITHOLE AND THEY ARE ONLY OPEN CERTAIN HOURS THATS HOW YOU KNOW ITS GOOD
DAMN FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT IT WAS SALT LICK I NEED TO GET BACK TO AUSTIN
PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY ALL YOU CAN EAT THAT I CAN GET BEHIND

THIS WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR ME EVERY DAY
I WANT TO GO TO THERE
I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN TO TEXAS OR THE US ARE SAYING THAT'S A LOT OF FOOD DANG MAN THAT LOOKS TASTY
I JUST GOT THE MUNCHIES
HEY OP WAS IT REALLY WORTH THE SEEMS EXPENSIVE AT LEAST WHERE IM FROM ANYWAYS
I LIVE ABOUT MINUTES FROM THIS PLACE THE BEST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE I ALWAYS GO FOR THE BRISKET AND RIB COMBO PLATE IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD DECISION

IN CASE YOU ARE INTERESTED
NAVIGATES TO COLLEGE BOARD WEBSITE AND SENDS SAT RESULTS TO UT
I ALWAYS ASSUMED GOING TO A BBQ PIT IN TEXAS AND GETTING FOOD THAT'S GREEN IS BLASPHEMY
LOOKS AMAZING BUT AFTER TRYING MAC AND CHEESE AT A FEW PLACES I MUST SAY IT'S A PRETTY BORING AND TASTELESS SIDE THAT TAKES UP VALUABLE STOMACH SPACE

MAYBE HERE IN ENGLAND WE CAN'T GET IT RIGHT
I CAN ONLY EAT WORTH OF BBQ AND SIDES
IN ALL HONESTY HOW DOES ONE EAT MORE THAN THIS ENTIRE PLATE
SAT WITH THIS GUY FROM NEW YORK ON A PLANE WHO WAS SAYING HOW MUCH BETTER NORTHERN BBQ IS THAN THE I LAUGHED AT HIS FACE
THAT'S ABOUT ALL I COULD EAT EVERY TIME I GO TO AN ALL YOU CAN EAT ESTABLISHMENT I EAT ONE PLATE AND WASTE OF MY SECOND
ON BEHALF OF ALL TEXANS WE WELCOME YOU
YOUR WELCOME SIR

MORE REASONS TO GO TO TEXAS THANKS

I ATE A WHOLE BIO GARDEN FOR UNDER THREE HUNDRED BUCKINGHAMSHIRE ADRENALINE RUSH
NOT A SINGLE PETNAP THOSE SAVAGES
THIS LOOKS DELICIOUS AND THOSE BEANS ARE SWIMMING IN SAUCE
YOU'RE WELCOME PARTNER
SOMEBODY SHOULD COMPILE A LIST OF ALL THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE NORTH DALLAS AREA
IS THIS PLACE BETTER THAN PECAN LODGE
HAD SOMETHING SIMILAR IN MY TOWN OF ROUND ROCK TX THE SALT LICK IT'S THOUGH WORTH EVERY PENNY



PRO TIP DON'T LOAD UP ON BREAD AND SIDES
I NEED TO FIND REAL BBQ WHERE I LIVE IT'S NOT LIKE THIS

TEXAS FOOD IS THE BEST

WE HAVE A PLACE IN CORPUS THAT DOES ALL YOU CAN EAT FOR IT'S PRETTY TASTY

I LOVE ME SOME BBQ
HEART DISEASE HAS NEVER SEEN SO ATTRACTIVE TO ME
GETTING SIDES IS A BEGINNER MISTAKE THAT'S HOW THEY GET YOU INSTEAD DOUBLE DOWN ON THE MEAT

THAT LOOKS OOOO GOOD
HOLY FUCKING MOTHER FUCK SHIT
WHERE'S THE WHITE BREAD ONIONS PICKLES JALAPENOS
GOD DAMN OP THAT LOOKS AMAZING NOW I'M SAD
THERE'S WORSE WAYS TO DIE
WHERE IN TEXAS IS THIS LOOKS GOOD

THIS IS WHY THERE ARE SO MANY NUTRITIONALLY ENHANCED TEXANS AT LEAST WE ARE HARDER TO KIDNAP
SHIT WHAT'S IN THAT PICTURE IS PROBABLY ALL I CAN EAT
THE SALTLICK IN AUSTIN IS LIKE THIS TOO AND THEIR BRISKET IS SO GOOD
I WOULD JUST BE ORDERING MEAT AND HUSHPUPPIES

ALSO I TOO RECENTLY WENT TO AN ALL YOU CAN EAT KOREAN BBQ CALLED IRON AGE ALL YOU CAN EAT A FREE ICE CREAM CONE AT THE END

KOREANS UNDERSTAND AMERICANS
I WOULD DUNK MY BALLS IN THAT DELICIOUS LOOKING MAC AND CHEESE
WHAT BEAN RECIPE IS THAT
HUTCHINS LOVE ME SOME HUTCHINS I'M FROM MCKINNEY DALLAS SUBURB WHERE THERE ORIGINAL LOCATION IS HAD THEM CATER MY SON'S GRADUATION FANTASTIC
WHAT'S THE GREEN STUFF

GODDAMN I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE
THE ONLY LOGICAL RESPONSE HETP
SWEET MOTHER OF GOD
THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND REMINDED ME OF A KOREAN BBQ IN CALIFORNIA CALLED MR BBQ THAT IS ALL YOU CAN EAT FOR IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND SOME OF THE BEST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD
AHHHHHHHH YUMMMMMM
WHY ARE ALL OF YOUR ACCE SO EXPENSIVE
WE GOT ALL YOU CAN EAT RIBS SIDES FOR HERE DAMN GOOD DEAL
BROCCOLI SERIOUSLY THE OWNERS MUST NOT BE FROM TEXAS AND NO OFFENSE OP BUT YOU NEED MORE BRISKET ON THIS PLATE PROPER RATIOS MUST BE MAINTAINED WISH I WAS THERE IN ANY CASE
THAT LOOKS LIKE EITHER HUTCHINS OR PECAN LODGE BOTH PLACES WILL KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFFICIAL
LOOKS YUMMY
DOWNVOTED FOR USE OF METAL PLATE AND PAPER BOATS INSTEAD OF A TROUGH
IT MIGHT BE ALL YOU CAN EAT BUT I'M PRETTY SURE I WOULD DIE IF I ATE ALL THE BBQ I COULD EAT
DALLAS PERSON HERE ALL I HAVE HAD FROM HUTCHINS IS THE STUFFED JALAPENOS SERIOUSLY AND I LOVE THE SHIT OUT OF FOOD THOSE WERE THE BEST THINGS I HAVE EVER HAD
THAT BROCCOLI SALAD LOOKS LEGIT
DUKES IN CHARLESTON SC IS
THE SIDES ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU EAT LESS RIBS
LOOKS MORE LIKE BARBECUE FOR

I'LL TAKE THREE
AS A PERSON FROM DIFFERENT SIDE OF THE WORLD IT'S VERY HARD TO ME TO SAY WHAT ARE THE PIECES OF FOOD ON THE PICTURE COULD SOMEONE PLEASE WRITE IT DOWN
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE ONE IN FRISCO THE ONE IN DOWNTOWN MCKINNEY HAS THE JALAPENO CORNBREAD ALSO ON THE WEEKENDS THEY HAVE BRISKET STUFFED
IS THIS THE HORS PLEASE SHOW US THE MAIN COURSES TOO

THIS IS TEXAS AFTER ALL
GENUINE QUESTION HERE WHAT DO AMERICANS MEAN WHEN THEY USE THE WORD BARBECUE

IN AUSTRALIA YOU HOLD A BARBECUE AN EVENT AT WHICH YOU BARBECUE MEAT ON A BARBECUE BUT WE DON'T SAY WOULD YOU LIKE SOME BARBECUE

IF AN AMERICAN OFFERED ME BARBECUE WHAT WOULD I BE GETTING
THAT'S ALL YOURE WEAK
BBQ AND YOU GOT SIDES
I GET HUNGRY BY WATCHING THIS PICTURE
I COULDN'T EVEN EAT ALL THAT RIGHT THERE
THAT'S A STRONG LOOKING CUP OF COFFEE

WOW THAT LOOKS GOOD
THIS IS WHY I HATE CANADA
OP DID THEY HAVE GOOD CORNBREAD I NEED TO KNOW
I'D GET THAT PORTION KNOWING I HAVE TO STITCH MY STOMACH BACK THAT NIGHT
SO WHAT WAS THE SECOND ROUND
WOULD BE TEARING UP SOME RIBS
I JUST ATE HERE A COUPLE DAYS AGO I'M FROM MICHIGAN AND THIS WAS HONESTLY THE BEST BBQ I'VE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
I ATE A QUARTER OF THE AMOUNT PICTURED FOR DOUBLE THE PRICE THANKS ENGLAND
WHERE IS THIS
OH SHIT
I'M GOING TO TEXAS
WHERE IS THIS AT IN TEXAS
WHERE'S THE TATER SALAD
IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THIS
THE CLOSEST THING WE HAVE TO ACCE BBQ HERE IN NEW YORK IS BRAZILIAN BBQ ALSO KNOWN AS CHURRASCARIA BUT NONE ARE AS LOW AS
THAT LOOKS TASTY I'D SKIP THE CHICKEN AND BEANS THOUGH AND WOULD EAT MORE BRISKET SAUSAGE
I WENT TO HARD LAST TIME I WAS IN DALLAS AND IT ONLY COST ME
GODDAMN THAT BRISKET LOOKS GOOD AND IS THAT JALAPENO CHEDDAR SAUSAGE I SPY
DAMN NO WONDER PEOPLE ARE SO FAT IN TEXAS
EULESS MAIN BBQ HAS THIS SAME DEAL IT'S A LITTLE CHEAPER AND THEY ARE FREAKING AWESOME HOWEVER THEY ARE ONLY OPEN THREE DAYS A WEEK
CURRENTLY IN COLLEGE STATION CONTEMPLATING TAKING THE DRIVE
YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD BRISKET WHEN IT HAS THAT BEAUTIFUL PINK RINK AROUND THE EDGES
THEY ACCIDENTALLY PUT SOME GREEN STUFF ON THAT PLATE I ASSUME THAT'S GARNISH AS IT'S NOT SWIMMING IN DELICIOUS SAUCE
DOES IT COME WITH A RASCAL SCOOTER AND AN OXYGEN TANK TO HAUL YOUR FAT ARSE AWAY NOT FORGETTING THE ELASTICATE JEANS
FOR TEN BUCKS YOU CAN AN EXCELLENT VEGAS BUFFET
DROOL THAT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY DIVINE
HHHHNNNNGGGGMMMMM
I'M REALLY SAD THAT I DON'T LIVE IN TEXAS NOW
THOSE BEANS LOOK AMAZING
OH MY GOD I WANT ALL OF THIS INSIDE OF MY BODY
GOD I LOVE THIS COUNTRY
LITERALLY BEEN EATING AT HUTCHINS SINCE I WAS BORN LITERALLY BORN IN MCKINNEY DIDN'T REALIZE I GREW UP EATING AWESOME BBQ UNTIL I TRIED OTHER PLACES LOL
HOW DO THEY MAKE MONEY I WORKED AT A PLACE THAT SOLD PORK RIBS FOR AND IT WAS A FOOD COST ITEM KNOWN AS A LOSS LEAD ITEM BASICALLY THEY DIDN'T PROFIT FROM IT BUT IT GOT PEOPLE IN THE DOORS AND HOPEFULLY ORDERING SOME DRINKS
WHERE
SAD THAT I SAW THE PLATE AND KNEW IT WAS HUTCHINS IMMEDIATELY
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WASTING STOMACH SPACE WITH VEGETABLES
BAKED BEANS AND OTHER SIDES ARE A WASTE OF STOMACH REAL ESTATE AT AN ALL YOU CAN EAT PLACE YOUR PLATE SHOULD BE MEAT MEAT AND MORE MEAT
FEED THE WORLD AT THAT PRICE
DROOLS BBQ SAUCE
HUTCHINS BBQ IS THE BEST I'VE EVER EATEN RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE AND THEY QUALITY IS SECOND TO NONE IT'S ALWAYS MY FIRST STOP WHEN I GO BACK HOME TO TEXAS TO VISIT FAMILY
YOURE WELCOME
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH FOR HOPE YOU MADE SECOND AND THIRD TRIPS
GOTTA BE HUTCHINS
BOOKMARKER I MIGHT BE IN THE DALLAS AREA IN A FEW MONTHS SO MAY CHECK IT OUT
DAMN

JUST DAMN
WE UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT HAVE ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ IN NYC ONE OF THE THINGS I MISS ABOUT FLORIDA
WHERE IN TEXAS IS THIS RESTAURANT
OME THIS LOOKS AMAZING
WHY DON'T WE HAVE THESE THINGS UP NORTHERN
DELICIOUS FOOD I WANT TO ATILT FROM MY SCREEN
IN MARIETTA GA WE HAVE THAT AT WILLIAMSON BROS FOR LIKE
THATS ALL YOU CAN EAT HUH

I WOULD MOTORBOAT THE FUCK OUT OF THAT MAC AND CHEESE
WHERE IN GODS NAME DID YOU FIT THAT WHEN I SEE THINGS LIKE THIS IT MAKES ME SO SAD BECAUSE IT ALL LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL BUT I KNOW I COULD BARELY EAT A THIRD OF IT

THERE ARE SO MANY GRAMS OF FAT IN THIS PICTURE IT'S GLORIOUS
I LOVE TEXAS NOW IF WE COULD JUST LEGALIZE THE GREEN STUFF THEN I'D GET MORE THAN MY WORTH AT A PLACE LIKE THIS
THERE'S A PLACE IN MICHIGAN THAT OFFERS ALL YOU CAN EAT FOR I BELIEVE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEAT AND UNLIMITED SIDES ONLY ON WEDNESDAY'S AND THEY DON'T EVEN ADVERTISE THE OFFER MAKES HUMP DAY A LITTLE LESS MISERABLE
THAT'S ALL I CAN EAT BBQ RIGHT THERE
THE MACARONI AND CHEESE LOOKS ANGELIC
I'LL BE IN A FOOD COMA XD
IS THAT BROCCOLI SLAW
DELICIOUS BUT I PREFER GUACAMOLE
ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE BROCCOLI DISH IS I DON'T EAT BBQ VERY OFTEN AND DEFINITELY NOTHING THAT DELICIOUS

REMINDS ME OF BLACKS BARBECUE DOWN IN TEXAS THAT WAS SOME OF THE BEST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD
BODACIOUS AND IN LONGVIEW TX THAT'S ALL YOU'LL EVER NEED OH ALSO MY DAD'S BBQ AS WELL
IS THIS AT HARD EIGHT
MY BODY WOULD PROBABLY DIE FROM ALL THAT GREASE
IF YOU ARE FLYING IN TO AUSTIN AND WANT SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR SALT LICK BBQ HAS ALL YOU CAN EAT PLATES FOR BUCKINGHAMSHIRE THEY JUST BRING WHATEVER MEAT YOU WANT IT'S AMAZING
IT IS KINDA SAD THIS GETS SO MANY UPVOTES JUST A NORMAL MIX OF MEAT
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS PLACE
DID YOU GET STONED BEFORE
WHAT RESTAURANT IS THIS AT
I LIVED IN ATX FOR A WHILE WHICH PLACE WAS THIS
IF ANYONE IS IN AUSTIN TEXAS GO TO BARBECUE IT'S THE BEST BBQ IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION
THAT BRISKET DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT

HERE IS WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE
THIS IS NOT WHAT MY PLATE WOULD LOOK LIKE AT AN ALL YOU AN EAT BBQ SPOT
DROOL PLEASE NAME THE RESTAURANT

POGCHAMP
MY BBQ BUFFET PLACE IS SALT LICK IN ROUND ROCK RIBS SAUSAGE AND GREAT BRISKET I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S THE ABSOLUTE BEST TASTING BUT IT'S CONSISTENTLY GOOD THERE IS NO HOURS LONG WAIT
IN PORTUGAL WE HAVE RESTAURANTS FOR UNDER

I MEAN YOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO EAT THIS IN THE BATHTUB WITH THE MESS IT WOULD MAKE
THE CHOCOLATE BEING POURED ON AT THE END WOULD RUIN IT CONGRATS EVERY BITE IS JUST GOING TO HAVE A CHOCOLATE TASTE AND NOTHING ELSE
THIS JUST FRUSTRATES ME WHAT'S THE POINT OF MAKING SOMETHING SO BIG THAT IT LITERALLY WON'T FIT IN YOUR MOUTH A SINGLE MARSHMALLOW COOKIE SANDWICH IS ENOUGH THERE'S NO NEED TO STACK IT A MILE HIGH
ALMOST EVERY DESERT I SEE ON HERE IS WAY SO FUCKING OVER THE TOP ITS GROSS NO NEED TO USE BOTTLES OF CHOCOLATE SYRUP
THAT LAST PART REMINDED ME OF THE BLACK OIL FROM THE
I WANNA WATCH THAT CHOCOLATE MELT AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT I HAVE NO INTEREST IN EATING IT

ALL IN GOOD FUN

HERE'S THE RECIPE VIDEO


WHAT SICK FUCK TOOK YOUR HAND IN EXCHANGE FOR A SANDWICH

IN ALL SERIOUSNESS LOOKS DELICIOUS OP
WOULD THE SANDWICH BE VERY OILY CONSIDERING THAT IT HAVE BEEN DIPPED IN AN EGG MIXTURE AND LEFT TO FRY OVER A PRETTY LARGE CHUNK OF BUTTER
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO EATS THESE WITH SYRUP

LAST MONTE CRISTO I ORDERED WAS MORE LIKE A GODDAMN OMELETTE FOR HOW MUCH EGG THEY HAD SOAKED THE BREAD IN PLUS IT WAS JUST EGG BREAD AND EGG NOTHING ELSE THAT MAKES IT FRENCH TOAST THIS LOOKS AMAZING BY COMPARISON
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD LOOKING GRILLED CHEESE

JAM

THAT'S LOVELY
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY A MONTE CRISTO BUT JUST ONE BITE BECAUSE THAT'S WAY TOO MANY CALORIES AND SUGAR FOR ME SUGAR AND I DON'T GET ALONG SAD FACE
I HOPE THAT'S POLENTA NOT MASHED POTATOES

AS LONG AS YOU ACTUALLY COOK THE CHICKEN THROUGH IT DOESN'T MATTER HOWEVER IF BAKING A FULL CHICKEN YOUR VEGGIES ARE GOING TO DRY OUT WAY BEFORE THE CHICKEN IS DONE
YOU COULD TRY SACRIFICING A COOKIE COOLING RACK ON TOP OF A REGULAR COOKIE SHEET OR WHATEVER YOU USE TO BAKE WITH NEXT TIME SO THE JUICES ARE BELOW THE FOODS
VEGGIES WILL TASTE AWESOME BUT MOST LIKELY WILL OVERCOOK YOU DIDN'T SAY IF WHOLE OR PIECES
WELL ITALIAN SODAS CLUB SODA FLAVORED SYRUP AND HALF AND HALF I LOVE THEM

JUST LET ME KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THE PROCESS WE TAKE THE MEATS OFF AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS THEY ALL TURNED OUT DELICIOUS THIS YEAR PER USUAL
HOW MANY PEOPLE COME TO YOUR THANKSGIVING FEAST TO JUSTIFY OF MEAT
WOW THIS LOOKS INCREDIBLE ANY WAY I CAN MARRY INTO YOUR FAMILY

WHEN DID YOU BEGIN THIS WHOLE PROCESS MONDAY LOL
THIS MUST SMELL FANTASTIC I'D BE MOSEYING OVER IF I WAS A NEIGHBOR I'D LIKE TO MAKE A DIY SMOKER IN THE SPRING BUT NOT SURE WHERE I'D GET A GRATE EVEN HALF THAT SIZE
CAN I COME OVER I ONLY DID FRIENDSGIVING AND ALL OF MY FRIENDS WERE VEGETARIANS
THAT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD TIME
WE SHOULD REALLY BE FRIENDS EVEN IF I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IT'S NOT COLD SMOKED BUT OH I WOULDN'T BE COMPLAINING
LOOKS GREAT WHAT KIND OF WOOD DID YOU USE
MAN CAN I COME OVER NEXT THANKSGIVING
LOOKS GREAT

SINCE YOU SAID YOU PULL MEATS OFF AT DIFFERENT TIMES HOW DO YOU HOLD AT TEMP SO THEY CAN BE SERVED TOGETHER
I WOULD DIE ATTEMPTING TO EAT ALL THAT
MY FIANCE WOULD BE IN HEAVEN
HOW DID YOU KEEP THE VENISON FROM DRYING IT TURN OUT

VENISON IS SO LEAN ANY TROUBLE
I HAVE A WOOD FIRED SANTA MARIA STYLE GRILL THAT I GRILL ON I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TRY TO SMOKE SOME MEATS ON THERE BUT HAVE HELD BACK FROM DOING IT BECAUSE I HAVE NO COVER FOR THE GRILL I CAN RAISE AND LOWER THE GRILLING SURFACE AND ADD AND MOVE WOOD TO CONTROL THE HEAT BUT THE MEAT IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR SORT OF LIKE THE SET UP YOU'VE GOT DOES SMOKING THE MEAT IN OPEN AIR HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF THE MEAT I WOULD LIKE TO SMOKE A PORK BUTT ON MY SANTA MARIA STYLE GRILL IF IT WILL WORK
I MAY NEED TO INVITE MYSELF OVER NEXT YEAR
HEROIC
SWEET JESUS
ARE YOU THE COOLEST PERSON IN THE WORLD
DO YOU MIND COMING TO AUSTRALIA AND COOKING WILL GIVE BLOW JOBS
I SEE A HAM ON THERE ALSO
YOU CAN SMOKE A WHOLE COW WITH THAT PIT
LOOKS AMAZING A BIT EXCESSIVE FOR PPL THOUGH
SMOKING IS BAD
DELETED
MUSTARD BASE IS MY AV
THE LIGHTING MAKES IT HARD TO TELL IF YOU'RE A TOMATO CREOLE OR A CAJUN ONE LOOKS GOOD THOUGH

BUT DAMN DUDE THERE'S LIKE TABLESPOONS OF ETOUFFE ON THAT RICE WHAT GIVES
IF ANYONE WANTS THE RECIPE PM ME IT'S OUT OF AN OLD CAJUN COOKBOOK
THAT TATER SALAD WHAT EGGS
THAT'S THE TYPE OF SIDE PIC THAT SHOWS JUST HOW AMAZING RESULTS OF SV CAN BE HOW LONG DID YOU COOK IT FOR I USUALLY DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING OUT FOOD FROM THE SV UNTIL IT'S GONE FOR 2 HOURS GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS PUT DOWN THE TIMER GO BY TOUCH TOUCH THE MEAT THROUGH THE BAG AND IF IT FEELS DONE TO YOUR LIKING TAKE IT OUT NEVER USE A TIMER AMAZING PICTURE I LOVE MY ANOVA AND RESULTS LIKE THIS
ADDED A BAKED SWEET POTATO SOME BROILED CARROTS AND A LITTLE SIDE OF BREAD

USED AN ANOVA IMMERSION COOKER AT SEASON IN BAD WITH SALT PEPPER GARLIC THYME AND ROSEMARY THEN SEARED ON CAST IRON ON HIGH HEAT WITH BUTTER GARLIC AND ROSEMARY
IS THAT OR IS THAT NOT TWO SEPARATE LAYERS OF BACON
BBQ SAUCE
ULTIMATE HANGOVER CURE RIGHT THERE
THIS LOOKS LIKE A CIGAR SHAPED SPACECRAFT FROM MARS
CHINESE GENERAL TSO OR LO MEIN
ICE CREAM BECAUSE IT SOOTHES MY THROAT FOR A BIT AND MAKE ME FEEL LESS MISERABLE OTHERWISE I JUST DRINK A LOT OF WARM HONEY MILK WITH SOME HARD LIQUOR IN IT
CHEESE AND TOMATO PUREE TOASTIER
CHICKEN SOU OH SORRY

APART FROM THAT THERE'S A VERY SIMPLE BROTH VERY COMMON IN ITALY WHEN YOU HAVE A COLD AND IT'S CALLED BIRODO VEGETABLE VEGETABLES STOCK LITERALLY
FILL A LARGE PAN WITH WATER
DICE A POTATO A CARROT AN ONION CILANTRO FEW CHERRY TOMATOES IN THE WATER
OPTIONALLY ADD ZUCCHINI CAULIFLOWER CABBAGE BEANS LENTILS OR ANY OTHER VEGGIES YOU MAY LIKE DEPENDING ON THE SEASON JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU WANT TO END UP WITH A VERY LIQUID TEXTURE NOT A THICK SOUP WHEN DECIDING THE QUANTITIES OF EACH INGREDIENT
ADD SALT AND OLIVE OIL TO TASTE
LET IT SIMMER FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS
COOK VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF TINY PASTA FORMATS OR EVEN SPAGHETTI BROKEN INTO INCH PIECES MY CHILDHOOD FAVOURITE IN THE BROTH ITSELF GRAMS PER PERSON SHOULD BE ENOUGH

I LIKE TO ADD FEW HOT PEPPER FLAKES TO THE BROTH WHILE SIMMERING TO ADD A LITTLE KICK WHICH IS USEFUL FOR STUFFY NOSE BUT MAYBE A BIT IRRITATING IN CASE OF SORE THROAT SERVE IN A BOWL AND GRATE SOME FRESH CHEESE BEFORE EATING
EGG DROP SOUP
ITALIAN WEDDING SOUP

GELATO

VIETNAMESE PHO
MASHED POTATOES MILD MAC AND CHEESE PLAIN WHITE RICE TOAST CRACKERS YOGURT INSTANT PUDDING MIX OR GELATIN BANANAS ICE CREAM IF YOU ARE FEELING REALLY NAUSEOUS TRY LIQUIDS LIKE LOW ACID JUICE SOYMILK EASIER ON THE STOMACH THAN DAIRY MILK OR SMOOTHIES I'M SICK AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH SO I'VE GOT THIS DOWN TO A SCIENCE THE TRICK IS TO EAT LOW ACID NOT TOO FLAVORFUL EASILY CHEWABLE FOOD THAT ISN'T HARD TO DIGEST
HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER

SOURCE AM VERY SICK CURRENTLY AND EATING MICROWAVE MAC AND CHEESE
TOMATO SOUP WITH A GRILLED CHEESE FOLLOWED BY A HOT TODDY
PHO OR WONTON SOUP WITH A TON OF CHILI OIL IT HELPS SO MUCH IF YOU'RE STUFFED UP
PHO THE CLOVES AND SPICES AND EVERYTHING JUST MAKE EVERYTHING FEEL SO WARM AND GOOD BUT IT HAS TO BE MADE RIGHT OTHERWISE IT'S JUST BASICALLY WEIRD CHICKEN SOUP
HOT TODDIES I ADD GINGER AND ANYTHING SPICY AND OR WITH GARLIC GARLIC IS SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT FOR COLDS AND SPICY FOODS CLEAR ME OUT IF I'M STUFFED UP I LIKE THINGS WITH STRONG FLAVORS SINCE WE ALL KNOW IT'S HARD TO TASTE MUCH OF ANYTHING WHEN YOU'RE SICK
LIST OF WHAT'S ON THE PLATTER
PHOTO EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE MOST POPULAR ITEM ON THE BOARD WAS TOOTHPICKS

THAT CAKE SLICE IS LIKE HUMONGOUS


HEY AM I LATE FOR THE FONDANT HATE TRAIN

IN ALL SERIOUSNESS IT LOOKS GREAT
THIS GIRL IS AMAZING ALWAYS LOVE WATCHING HER
WHAT IS THE LIQUID SHE COVERS THE CAKE WITH
WAIT HOW DID SHE EASILY CUT THE CIRCLE OUT OF THE FONDANT AFTER IT WAS ALREADY SET ON THE CAKE THAT WOULD SURELY BE A HOLE USING JUST THAT CUTTER AND SOME PRESSURE
THATS A PASTRY CHEF SO MUCH DIFFERENT THAN A CHEF
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO MAKE THE THING SHE USES TO SYRUP HER CAKES I WANT ONE BUT CANNOT MAKE MYSELF SPEND BUCKS ON IT
THIS GIF REALLY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION
CHALLENGE DO IT WITHOUT NASTY FONDANT
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOU BUT HOW CAN ANYONE EAT CAKE WITH THAT MUCH FONDANT ON IT

THATS A HUGE ASS SLICE OF CAKE
I'VE NEVER HAD FONDANT IS IT AS BAD AS EVERYONE SAYS
I WAS PRACTICALLY PRAYING THAT SHE'D LINE THE CIRCLE FOR THE BUTTON UP WITH THE SEAM SO I'M SATISFIED

THE JOYS OF POKEMON
FONDANT IS OK
TRYING TO ADD A DIFFERENT HATE INSTEAD OF THE FONDANT I CANNOT STAND WHEN BAKERIES USE SIMPLE SYRUP TO KEEP THE CAKE MOIST IF YOU ARE A DECENT BAKER YOUR CAKES SHOULDNT NEED MOISTENING OR ALL OF THAT EXTRA SUGAR
WHY NOT MAKE EDIBLE CAKES BLUH
NEVERMIND THE FONDANT IT'S BASICALLY JUST FUCKING BREAD INSIDE
I HATE THE FROSTING THAT IS THIS
FONDANT ICING GROOOOOSS
FONDANT JUST STOP IT
ANYONE ELSE PISSED OFF THAT IT WAS A POKE BALL INSTEAD OF A DEATH STAR

VERY COOL THOUGH REGARDLESS THUMBS UP FROM ME

AT LEAST THEY USED CAKE INSTEAD OF RICE CRISPY TREATS
I WANT A WIFE LIKE THAT

SO I FEEL PRETTY DUMB RIGHT NOW BUT I JUST PUT TOGETHER THAT THE DILL IN DILL PICKLES IS FROM THE HERB AND NOT A GENERIC BRAND NAME OR SOMETHING WOW
THOSE LOOK SO GOOD

IS THAT CONTAINER SPECIFICALLY FOR FERMENTING THINGS IF SO WHERE DID YOU GET IT
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FERMENTING PICKLES AND PICKLING PICKLES TASTE AND METHOD WISE
CAN YOU TAKE A PICTURE PER DAY OVER THE WEEK AND UPLOAD THEM ALL IN A TIMELINE
OH MY GOD
DUDE MAM YOU HAVE GOT TO LET ME KNOW HOW THEY TURN OUT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS FOR OVER A YEAR WITH NO SUCCESS I KNOW THAT I'M ONE STEP AWAY FROM MAKING SOME GOOD SOUR KRAUT KIM CHI KOMUCHA FERMENTED FOODS I LOVE THE STORE BOUGHT STUFF BUT NOTHING I MAKE TASTES AS GOOD OR IS EVEN EDIBLE
I DO THIS A FEW TIMES A YEAR

SALT SOLUTION GRAMS OF KOSHER SALT PER LITER OF WATER

SHIPLOAD OF PEELED GARLIC

SHIPLOAD OF DILLWEED

HANDFUL OF BLACK PEPPERCORNS

LITTLE CUCUMBERS WHEN IN SEASON

I USE A BIG LITER BUCKET WEIGH THE CUKES DOWN WITH A PLATE TO KEEP THEM UNDER WATER AND A TUPPERWARE BOX FILLED WITH WATER ON TOP BUCKET HAS A LID

WHOLE THING UNDER THE SINK FOR DAYS POKE AT IT EVERY FEW DAYS

PICKLES CHEAP AND CHEERFUL AND AWESOME
WHAT'S YOUR RECIPE I KEEP LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT ONE
THIS SURPRISES ME A BIT SINCE MAKING PICKLES IS A THING PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE DOES HERE IN THE BALTICS FIND ME SOMEONE WITH A BASEMENT WHO DOES NOT HAVE A FEW HOME-MADE JARS OF JAM AND PICKLES
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM UPON COMPLETION HAVE WANTED TO TRY THIS MYSELF FOR AWHILE ACTUALLY

REMINDME WEEK
MAKE SURE YOU SAVE THE JUICE

YOU CAN FLICK IT ON YOUR SANDWICHES FOR FLAVOR
MOUTHWATERING
THESE LOOK PHENOMENAL

HATS OFF TO YOU SIR
DO THEY HAVE TO BE REFRIGERATED
HAVE THEY ALREADY BEEN GOING A WHILE USUALLY PICKLES TAKE MORE LIKE A MONTH THAN A WEEK
THIS IMAGE HAS ME IN A BIT OF A PICKLE BUT IT'S NO BIG DILL
MUST TRY THIS I HAVE A DILL ESSENTIAL OIL THAT SMELLS SCRUMPTIOUS AND I WILL ADD IT
POST THIS TO R FERMENTATION AND ALSO LOOK AROUND FOR NEW IDEAS
REMINDME DAYS
A NICKEL FOR YOUR PICKLE


RECIPE
REMINDME DAYS
WILL BE BACK IN A WEEK FOR YOUR PICKLE UPDATE PICS OR DIDN'T HAPPEN
I'M JUST LOOKING FOR A LITTLE SLAP AND PICKLE
I HOPE THEY TURN OUT LOVELY THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO
LET US KNOW WHEN MANUSCRIPT FRIZZLE AND HER CLASS SHOW UP

LOOKS COOL
REMINDME WEEK
I DID THIS WITH MAHI SKIN AND PEE
THERE ARE FERMENTING DILL PICKLES IN THAT JAR
IF YOU USED VINEGAR IT IS POSSIBLE YOUR GARLIC WILL TURN BLUE-GREEN DUE TO A REACTION WITH MINUTE COPPER TRACES IT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL AND SAFE TO EAT JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A HEADS UP I FREAKED OUT A BIT THE FIRST TIME I PICKLED GARLIC AND THAT HAPPENED
I TRIED FERMENTING PICKLES ONCE AND THEY CAME OUT INCREDIBLY MUSHY AND GROSS WHAT DID I DO WRONG
IS THAT AN AQUARIUM

OH
REMINDME WEEK
OK
I TRIED THIS AT HOME BUT MY PICKLES WENT BROWN AND MUSHY HAVEN'T TRIED THEM AGAIN SINCE ANY IDEA WHAT I DID WRONG
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A REALLY NICE AQUASCAPED FISH TANK
ENJOY I DID MY FIRST FERMENTING OF DILL PICKLES THIS SUMMER I CLEANED OUT AN OLD PICKLE CROCK AND JUST TRIED IT I LET THE FIRST BATCH GO TOO LONG AND GOT SOME HOLLOWED OUT PICKLES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CROCK THE SECOND ATTEMPT AT ABOUT SEVEN DAYS WAS JUST RIGHT I'M STILL ENJOYING THE PICKLES ON BURGERS AND IN POTATO SALADS AND OTHER THINGS

SADLY I DIDN'T THINK TO TAKE PICTURES THANKS FOR POSTING YOUR
DDK WHAT THIS IS OR WHAT ITS FOR BUT IT IS VERY SATISFYING
REMINDME DAYS
TRY USING SQUASH OR ZUCCHINI NEXT TIME I HAVEN'T USED CUCUMBERS SINCE
IF YOU COLLECTING GRASS I'VE GOT SOME FOR YA
HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE DOES IT TASTE LIKE STORE-BOUGHT WHAT'S YOUR RECIPE
REMINDME WEEK

REMINDME DAYS
SH IN TWO WEEKS YOU ARE GOING TO FIND OUT THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE USED DILL SEED NOT DILL WEED MAYBE AKRE TOO NEXT TIME
THIS LOOKS LIKE SWAMP GRASS IN A JAR
I CAME
NAH
DID YOU PUT IT ON ANYTHING
THIS LOOKS SPECTACULAR I ALREADY HAVE SEVERAL BEERS IN MIND I WOULD PAIR WITH THIS WELL LOOKS LIKE I'M STOPPING BY THE STORE TOMORROW ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK
CURRENTLY SALIVATING THAT LOOKS AMAZING ENJOY
WHEN DID YOU ADD THE PEACHES OR RATHER FOR HOW LONG
ARE THOSE FRESH PEACHES OR CANDIED CAN PEACHES
SUCH A GREAT COMBINATION NOT
MEAT WITH FRUIT WHY WOULD YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING THIS A SWEET FRUIT WITH PORK IT SOUNDS SO GOOD SAID SARCASTICALLY
NO
I WOULD SAY NO
DEFINITELY NOT
YOU GOT A RECIPE FOR THIS CHICKEN SOUNDS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY
THAT RICE IS PERFECT GOOD JOB MMMM
LOOKS GREAT GOOD JOB
THAT LOOKS MIGHTY TASTY GREAT SMOKE RING
LOOKS AMAZING
THIS LOOKS BEYOND WONDERFUL I THINK SAND WHICH SHOULD BE GREAT
AS USUAL THE CENTER IS TOO GRAY YOU LET YOUR SMOKER GET ABOVE BOILING POINT OF WATER TRY AGAIN YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT THE DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU MASTER LOW AND SLOW SAME SMOKE RING AND BARK BUT JUICY PINK MEAT
HATE TO BE THAT GUY BUT THAT LOOKS A LITTLE DRY HOW TENDER WAS THE MEAT
WOW LOOKS GREAT FROM HERE

ANOTHER SUGGESTION FOR NEXT TIME TRY SEPARATING THE POINT FROM THE FLAT BEFORE COOKING WHEN THEY ARE AT ABOUT INTERNAL PULL THE FLAT AND WRAP IN FOIL AND TOWELS AND PUT IN COOLER CUBE THE POINT WITH A LITTLE MORE RUB AND PUT BACK ON IN PAN AND COOK FOR TWO MORE HOURS AT

WHEN DONE YOU'LL HAVE BURNT ENDS FOR APPETIZER AND CAN SLICE THE POINT WHICH YOU HELD WARM IN THE COOLER
OP IT LOOKS AMAZING BUT YOUR BRISKET TRIMMING NEEDS SOME IMPROVEMENT YOUTUBE BRISKET TRIMMING INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW YOU WANT AN AERODYNAMIC BRISKET WITHOUT HUGE RIDGES AND SMOOTH EDGES SO THE SMOKE CAN PROPERLY ENVELOP IT YOU CLEARLY HAVE THE SKILLS TO GET THE SMOKE RING AND SMOKE PART DONE PROPERLY IF YOU CAN TRIM IT UP A LITTLE BETTER I THINK YOU'LL BE BLOWN AWAY AT WHAT COMES OUT REGARDLESS THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL BRISKET OP PLEASE DO NOT TAKE MY COMMENT ABOVE AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM IT'S A FANTASTIC RESULT NONETHELESS
DELETED
HEY WHY DON'T YOU JUST BURN IT
OVERCOOKED
THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS
CUTE
MAN THAT PICTURE SHOULD BE NEXT TO PORK CHOP IN THE DICTIONARY
BEEN TO THE PERRIS IN PEARLAND IS IT OF THE SAME FOOD FAMILY THATS A SEXY CHOP
SO WHAT IS IT
LOOKS GOOD JUST REMINDS ME THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD THINGS ARE DIFFERENT
NO SAUCE CHEESE OR VEGGIES SO A LITTLE CALAMARI COVERED IN BREAD AND SITTING ON BREAD
THIS IS PRETTY TYPICAL IN MADRID THERE IS A BAR CALLED EL DIAMANTE AND THEY MAKE THE BEST BOCADILLOS DE CALAMARIES IN THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY SAUCE OR VEGGIES JUST THE BREAD AND CALAMARI SO SOFT AND DELICIOUS
LOOKS PROCESSED NOT A BAD THING OR WAS IT ACTUAL RINGS CUT FROM THE ANIMAL
ALL THE CALAMARI I EVER ATE LOOKED LIKE LITTLE BABY SQUIDS WITH SOME TINY RINGS THOSE LOOK LIKE ONION RINGS
IS THE BREAD BREADED
ONION RING HOTDOGS
OH YEAH THERE IS PROBABLY A FRIED CHICKEN EMBRYO ON THERE TOO
PERFECTLY FRIED EGG NACE
I THINK WHATEVER BIRD YOU HAD SHIT ON YOUR PLATE HAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM
SIDE OF POTATO I SEE
MANUAL I LIVE IN A PRETTY SHITTY CITY AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT STUFF LIKE THIS MAKES MY EYES POP OUTTA MY HEAD
RECIPE THAT'S THE GREATEST LOOKING BAKLAVA I HAVE EVER SEEN
HOW BOUT A LITTLE MORE BACLAVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

UUUUUUGH ONE OF THE MANY BEAUTIFUL THINGS ABOUT HAVING A SYRIAN BOYFRIEND
DID ANYONE ELSE READ BALACLAVA
DAMNING I REALLY WANT TO TRY THAT IM NOT ONE TO COOK BUT THOSE LOOK AMAZING AND WOULD LOOK EVEN BETTER WITH A SIDE OF BACON EGGS ETC
WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF BAKING SODA WHY NOT JUST USE BAKING POWDER
DELETED
OH MAN THOSE LOOK SO PERFECT AND FLUFFY
NOW I'M REALLY MISSING MY CHILDHOOD PICKING FRESH PEAS FROM MY GARDEN THAT ONE REALLY DOES LOOK PERFECT
PERFECT

HAD TO STOP AUTOCORRECT FOR THAT ONE
IN ENGLAND WE JUST CALL THEM PEAS
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED GETTING YOUR PEA POD INTO MODELLING IT'S GOT A FUTURE IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING ETC
R ODDLYSATISFYING
SO THATS A YY OR A YY FOR THE GREEN NAD A XX OR XX FOR THE NO SHRIVELLED SO WHO KNOW THAT MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY BE PERFECT IT COULD BE HIDING THOSE YELLOW SHRIVELLED GENES YOU SHOULD PROBABLY EAT IT TO PREVENT THOSE GENES FROM PASSING ON
STUPENDIOUS
ITS TOO GOOD LOOKING TO BE EATEN
MY MOM TELLS ME I'M THE MOST PERFECT ENGLISH PEA
IF YOU ATE IT HOW DID YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF IT
LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE 2 SIGNIFICANT BLEMISHES
NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THE POD ONLY CARE ABOUT PEAS THAT'S VEGETIST
UPVOTES REALLY
AT LEAST IT LOOKS SUPER HAPPY TO HAVE BEEN KILLED ROASTED AND NOW SLICED UP
HE'S GONNA NEED A BIGGER BUN
THAT'S JUST A PIG BOARS HAVE TUSKS

TOMATOES HAVE SO MUCH SUGAR YOU CAN USUALLY TELL WHEN THEY ARE OVER THE LINE BY THE FERMENT SMELL AND THEY FEEL LIKE A WATER BALLOON ABOUT TO BURST I BET IT WAS ACTUALLY UNDER RIPE
HOW DO YOU MAKE THESE THEY LOOK DELICIOUS
YAS BREAD

BURGER HAS INGREDIENTS I DON'T LIKE AND I WOULD STILL WANT TO EAT THIS THING AND THOSE WEDGES ARE

NICE JOB OP
I JUST CAME SO HARD LOOKING AT THIS LUCKILY I AM SITTING IN THE TOILET
CRANBERRY BRIE IS ONE OF MY AV TEXTURES HOW MUCH MEST WAS ON THAT BURGER WITH IT WHAT ARE THE OTHER ACCOUTREMENTS
BURGER AIN'T MY TYPE BUT THOSE FRIES THOOOOOOO
LOVE THIS IDEA LOOKS AMAZING
I THINK IT'S NEAT THAT YOU USED CRANBERRIES ON A BURGER I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THAT BEFORE IT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD

ALSO THIS POTATO WEDGES LOOK INSANELY DELICIOUS
IF I HAD ONLY READ THE DESCRIPTION I THINK IT SOUNDS ODD AND UNAPPETIZING HOWEVER AFTER SEEING THE PICTURE I REALLY WANT TO TRY IT
LOOKS DIVINE
HOT DAMN THAT LOOKS UNREAL
I MUST KNOW THE SECRET TO THESE FRIES
NOT SURE IF CRANBERRIES WORK WELL WITH BURGERS

SIDE QUESTION WHAT'S WITH THE WOODEN SLATE INSTEAD OF A PLATE CRAZE THESE DAYS IN MY OPINION PRESENTATION DOESN'T MATTER WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A GOOD BURGER A GOOD BURGER WILL SPEAK FOR ITSELF NO NEED TO FANCY IT UP BY TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK I'M AT SOME CHIC EATERY
NORTH VIETNAM WON THE WAR BUT HERE THEY ARE CAPITALIST WHILE YOU HAVE A BURGER FRIES AND A COKE CULTURAL VICTORY ACHIEVED

THE CHEESE ENDED UP TASTING LIKE ASS AND THE MEAT WAS MADE OF MUTTON THE ENTIRE THING WAS INEDIBLE IT WAS SO DEPRESSING

THEN I HAD A THREE WAY WITH TWO HOT AUSTRALIANS

ITS BLOODY EXPENSIVE TO GET DOWN THERE WHEN SCIENTISTS DO GET DOWN THERE THEY ARE GENERALLY MORE INTERESTED HOW THEY INTERACT AND LEARNING RATHER THAN IF THEY TASTE GOOD DEEP FRIED IN BATTER
DEPENDS ARE WE TALKING MESOPELAGIC BATHYPELAGIC ABYSSOPELAGIC OR HADOPELAGIC

IF MESOPELAGIC PRETTY MUCH HOW ANY REGULAR FISH WOULD TASTE LIKE IN FACT SOME ARE REGULAR FISH

IF BATHYPELAGIC AND ABYSSOPELAGIC NOT MUCH TO EAT PROBABLY A BIT LIKE SULFUR AND HAS THE CONSISTENCY OF JELLY DUE TO SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

IF HADOPELAGIC THERE ARE NOT ANY FISH THAT DEEP DOWN I THINK

IN THE CASE OF A GIANT SQUID PROBABLY LIKE EATING A TIRE I THINK SOME PEOPLE GOT A PIECE OF ONE AND ATE IT


BUT AS THE OTHER CEMENT SAID IT IS GENERALLY NOT WORTH IT DUE TO THE EXTREME EXPENSES INVOLVED AND THE SMALL YIELD IN COMPARISON

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

THAT DINER LOOKS ON POINT MAKES ME MISS BERLIN
WHERE
DELECTABLE ALTHOUGH MY SOUTHERN ASS WOULD HAVE TO ADD BACON
HOLY CRAP SO SWEET
LOOKS DELICIOUS WHAT ARE THE YELLOW BITS

AGREE WITH U ODYLE I THINK BACON GONE NICELY WITH IT NOT FOR THE MEMES BUT FOR THE CONTRASTING TASTES AND TO COUNTER BALANCE THE SWEETNESS I KNOW THE PRETZELS ARE THERE BUT I STRUGGLE WHEN THINGS ARE TOO SWEET PERSONALLY
ARE THOSE BEETS ON TOP
FROM R PIZZA ONE THING I WILL CHANGE IS THE PLACEMENT OF THE WOOD IN THE OVEN I SPREAD IT ALL AROUND THE OUTSIDE RING AFTER IT GOT GOING AND IT KEPT THE ENTIRE OVEN HOT NEXT TIME I PLAN TO PUSH IT TO ONE SIDE TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONTROL OF TEMPERATURE ZONES I THINK THIS WILL CUT DOWN ON THE BURNT CRUSTS
SOME AWESOME LOOKING PIZZAS GREAT JOB
SOAKED IN RUM I HOPE
TO ME THAT'S JUST A NORMAL SIZED PANCAKE
OVERSIZED PANCAKES ARE THE BEST
HBTWFQR
LOL
IS THE CLOSEST I'VE GOTTEN TO PERFECT

IF YOU USE CANNED CHERRY NECK CLAMS YOU'LL GET A BETTER CHOWDER JUST DRAIN THEM RESERVE THE LIQUID AND CLEAN THEM THEY'RE DIRTY BASTARDS I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND A PERFECT RECIPE BUT I'M A WEST COAST BOY ALSO NO POINTS SHE WAS ITALIAN AND THE ONLY RECIPE FOR FISH STEW I COULD GIVE YOU WOULD NOT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
START BY MAKING A ROUX MELT SOME BUTTER MIX IN FLOUR STIR AS IT COOKS TIL GOLDEN COLORED
TO COOK YOUR CLAMS RINSE THEM VERY VERY WELL AND PUT THEM IN A POT WITH SOME WATER COOK THEM UNTIL THEY POP OPEN THEN TAKE THEM OUT OF THE SHELLS SAVE ABOUT A CUP OF THE LIQUID USED TO COOK THEM
ADD A FEW CUPS OF WHOLE MILK ONCE THE ROUX IS GOLDEN AND THE LIQUID FROM THE CLAMS TOO STIR AND LET COOK UNTIL THICK SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER
SWEAT SOME ONIONS ADD SOME GARLIC AND COOK SLIGHTLY THEN ADD TO THE SOUP ADD SOME SLIGHTLY UNDERCOOKED POTATOES IN BIG CHUNKS AND THE CLAMS LET IT COOK TOGETHER ON A MEDIUM HEAT UNTIL IT IS HOT AND CREAMY AND BUBBLY
YOU CAN ALSO ADD COOKED BACON IF YOU LIKE THAT

THIS RECIPE IS STRAIGHT FROM MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER
CHINESE BUFFET
NO CHOCOLATE THAT'S MY KIND OF CANNOLI

EDIT NEVER MIND I SEE IT NOW I PREFER CANDIED CITRON IN MY FILLING
VERY NICE WHAT WAS THE MARINADE ALSO IT MIGHT BE THE LIGHTING BUT THAT LOOKS FAIRLY PINK FOR PORK
THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A LOIN NOT A TENDERLOIN DIFFERENT CUT
COLA SEAFOOD
CRABBING IS CLOSED FROM TILLAMOOK BAY TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF DIADIC ACID SPELLING COULD BE OFF I'M SURE CANNON BEACH IS SAFE THOUGH
DID YOU EAT IT WARM OR CHILLED THE REASON I ASK IS THAT I USED TO TRAVEL FOR WORK AND HAD NEVER HAD DUNGENESS CRAB I'D HAD PLENTY OF SNOW CRAB AND IT WAS ALWAYS SERVED WARM

SO I'M IN SAN FRANCISCO AT A PRETTY RESTAURANT AND THE FIRST THING I SEE ON THE MENU IS DUNGENESS CRAB SO I ORDER IT I WAS SURPRISED WHEN IT ARRIVED COLD BUT IT WAS VERY DELICIOUS
OR WHAT
I LOVE THESE IN THE SUMMER MY FRIEND AND I WALKED DOWN TO THE PIER ABOUT HALF A BLOCK AWAY AND THROW DOWN THE TRAPS HAD A FEAST ALMOST DAILY OF CRAB
NICE WE WERE IN CANNON BEACH A FEW DAYS AGO LOVE THAT AREA
THIS IS MAKING ME HUNGRY
COLA SEAFOOD I LOVE NUWW IN ASTORIA AS WELL
GREW UP CRABBING IN NECTARIS BAY EVERY AUGUST SUCH AN AWESOME PLACE
I'VE DONE THAT I'M FROM HAWAII AND LOVE GOING OUT THERE TO THE COAST EVERY YEAR MY WIFE AND I LOVE GOING TO MARINA WHICH I THINK IS ONLY A MIN DRIVE FROM CANNON BEACH AND RENTING A BOAT AND CATCHING CRABS THEN EATING IT THERE WITH SOME GOOD BEER

IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE CHOOSE GRILLED OR BAKED FOODS OVER FRIED FOODS ASK FOR DRESSING ON THE SIDE FOR SALADS AND IF YOU'RE CRAVING A DESSERT OR SOMETHING SWEET A SMALL ICE CREAM CONE IS A BETTER OPTION THAN SOMETHING LIKE A DAIRY QUEEN BLIZZARD

RECIPE

WAFFLE BREAD PUDDING

WAFFLE SECTIONS
CUP MILK
EGGS
CUP SUGAR
TSP VANILLA EXTRACT

GREASE AN PAN
PREHEAT YOUR OVEN TO DEG FOLIO
CUT WAFFLES INTO RELATIVELY PIECES AND SPREAD IN THE PAN
BLEND EVERYTHING ELSE TOGETHER AND POUR OVER THE WAFFLE BITS TRY TO MAKE SURE YOU COVER EVERYTHING RELATIVELY EVENLY
LET STAND FOR OR MINUTES TO LET IT ALL SOAK UP
BAKE UNTIL THE CENTER IS SET AND THE EDGES START TO BROWN AND PULL AWAY FROM THE SIDES DEPENDS ON YOUR OVEN BUT PLAN ON AT LEAST TO MINUTES

I USED EGBO HOME STYLE WAFFLES FOR THIS ONE TO SAVE A BIT OF TIME BUT ANY WAFFLE WILL WORK TRY IT WITH WAFFLES

I SERVE IT WARM OR COLD IT'S DELICIOUS EITHER WAY

I AM FEELING IT WHAT ELSE IS IN THERE
YUMMY MAY I KNOW WHAT INGREDIENTS ARE USED TO MAKE THIS I WANT TO TRY THIS AT MY HOME
WHAT IS THE RECIPE WE WANNA TRY THIS AT HOME
I PREFER MY POTATO SALAD TO NOT BE WET THOUGH
BUT DID YOU PUT ANY SHRIMP IN THERE
LOOKS AMAZING
I LOVE THAT IT SAYS SHRIMP TWICE AIN'T COOLIN AROUND
GOTTA HAVE POTATO SALAD WITH GUMBO IT'S A MUST
NICE DETAIL

ANOTHER HOUSE DIVIDED BY PEPPERONI CHEER GO FOR OLIVES
FUCK OLIVES
LOOKS DELICIOUS LOVE ARABIC FOOD
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT DINNER IT WASN'T THAT BAD AND I'LL ADMIT THAT THE PITA BREAD WAS SLIGHTLY CHARRED
DID SOMEONE SAY PEANUT BUTTER

IN REALITY THO PRETZELS WORK GREAT WITH PB
I ADD PEANUT BUTTER TO OATMEAL
CELERY STICK APPLE SLICE
SALTINE CRACKERS PRETZEL CHIPS USE A BAR OF CHOCOLATE AS DIPPER

I SECOND APPLES

GOING TO TRY PB IN OATMEAL TOMORROW
NO YOU ARE NOT A SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE FOR LIKING PEANUT BUTTER
DEFINITELY SONIC IT'S SOOSOO GOOD IT'S FUNNY HOW THEY HAVE TO CALL IT RAINBOW CANDY DUE TO COPYRIGHT ISSUES
I THOUGHT I WAS IN R UNSTIRREDPAINT FOR A MOMENT
SONICS

LOVE NERDS
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE A GALAXY FROM THE DISTANCE THIS IS AN AMAZING FOOD ART I SHOULD SAY BECAUSE IT LOOKS DELICIOUS AND CREATIVE

I FOUND YOU AGAIN MR J

FATHER BEAR
MOISTMAKER IS THE SLICE OF BREAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SANDWICH NOT THE SANDWICH NAME ITSELF
ELI THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAZELNUT SPREAD AND NITELLA
WISH YOU HAD TAKEN A BETTER PICTURE SO WE COULD SEE HOW THEY LOOK OR MAYBE WHATS INSIDE
YOU EAT THE STUFF OF DREAMS
WHILE SCROLLING THROUGH QUICKLY THIS LOOKED LIKE CHOCOLATE LIZARDS BASKING ON DOUGHNUT ROCKS
I CANT SAY SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE NEXT THING MIGHT BE OR EVEN IF I AGREE WITH YOUR PREMISES BECAUSE I HAVENT SEEN IT TO THE EXTENT YOU MAY HAVE BUT IF YOU ARE TALKING AMERICA AND HOW THINGS DEVELOP HERE IT WILL BE SOMETHING PRETTY COMMON IN ANOTHER CULTURE BUT HOMOGENIZED TO MEET THE GENERIC AMERICAN TASTE THAT IS WHAT CHORIZO SYMBOLIZES A RATHER COMMON INGREDIENT EXOTIC ENOUGH BUT THEN TO GAIN TRACTION POPULARITY AND SUITABILITY FOR THE AMERICAN PALATE THE SAME THING THAT BUY FONG DID WITH SRIRACHA SO ON THAT TIP I WOULD VENTURE SOMETHING LIKE BANG BANG VARIANTS WHICH IS BASICALLY SRIRACHA AND RANCH DRESSING
I THINK LAB GROWN MEAT IS EVENTUALLY GOING TO NOT ONLY BE POPULAR BUT THE NORM THE MEAT INDUSTRY AS IT IS COMBINED WITH WORLD POPULATION GROWTH IS UNSUSTAINABLE AND THERE'S ALREADY A GROWTH IN AWARENESS OF FACTORY FARM CONDITIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BUT AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE WANT MEAT THE WHOLE WORLD ISN'T ABOUT TO GO VEGAN ALL IT'LL TAKE IS THE FUNDING

MORE SHORT-TERM INDIAN FOOD SOONER OR LATER THE US IS GONNA HAVE THE INDIAN FOOD EQUIVALENT OF TACO BELL OR PF CHANGS

EVEN SHORTER TERM IT'LL BE A CONDIMENT LIKE HOW DIJON MUSTARD MEXICAN SALSA OR SRIRACHA BLEW UP I'D PUT MY MONEY ON SOMETHING MOLECULAR GASTRONOMIC JARRED SPHERICAL JUICES AND VINEGARS OR MAYBE A CONVENIENT FOAMER

OR MAYBE IT'LL JUST BE PICKLED BEANS

THAT'S NOT REAL
I'M SPEECHLESS
WELCOME TO A KEYS PARTY
RECIPE

MY VERSION IS MADE WITH STUFFED OLIVE AND HOMEMADE HORSERADISH CREAM AND DECORATED WITH EGGS AND CARROT
SO IT'S IS GELATIN CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO THIS AMERICAN WHAT IT TASTED LIKE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS
VERY PRETTY HOW DOES IT TASTE
AMERICAN HERE AND I TOO AM VERY CONFUSED ABOUT THIS
LOOKS GOOD BUT I NEVER WILL UNDERSTAND WHY SOME PEOPLE DON T MIX THE PASTA WITH THE SAUCE
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE MEAL SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD MY MOTHER WOULD MAKE IT SEVERAL TIMES A MONTH AND I NOW MAKE IT AND EAT IT OFTEN
WORK ON YOUR PRESENTATION
REALLY NICE WORK ON THE APPLES BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CRUST THERE
TEXTURES COLORS AND SHAPES SEEM SO PERFECT I'M SURE THIS WOULD BE THE YUMMIEST POT PIES I WISH I COULD EAT THEM
WHAT A GREAT IDEA YOU'VE INSPIRED ME TO DO THE SAME WITH OUR LEFTOVERS
REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING
MARTHA STEWART WOULD BE SO PROUD
VERY NICE
WHY ARE ALL THESE FANCY DESIGNED PIES USING THE CRUST WORST PART OF A PIE ITS LIKE SURE NICE DESIGN BUT NOW THERE IS MORE CRUST AND A POORER CRUST TO TASTY PIE FILLING RATIO WHY NOT MAKE DESIGNS IN THE PUMPKIN OR INSTEAD OF AN ADDITIVE CRUST APPLICATION DO A SUBTRACTIVE DESIGN BY REMOVING CRUST IN THE SHAPES OF LEAVES AND VARIOUS FALL ORNAMENTATIONS

NICE LOOKING PIE BY THE WAY
PRETTY BUT THE LEAVES KINDA LOOK LIKE FROGS
RECIPE NEW YORK TIMES
IT LOOKS GREAT NICE JOB
THIS LOOKS OOOO YUMMY
BOOKMARKER THAT COLOR IS AMAZING
AND POORLY SLICED AVOCADO
USED TO MAKE THIS ALL THE TIME AND AFTER SEEING THIS PIC I DON'T KNOW WHY I STOPPED
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FAQ ON THE CORDELLE WEBSITE THEY LIST THEIR DISH AS SAFE UP TO DEGREES WITH SOME DISCLAIMERS ATTACHMENTS ARE LISTED AS BEING SAFE TO FOOT HANDLE WHICH SEEMS LIKE A ODDLY SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE SO ASSUMING YOUR DISHES ARE FAIRLY STANDARD CORDELLE I THINK YOU ARE FINE I WOULD PERSONALLY STAY BELOW JUST TO BE SAFER I LIKE TO PURCHASE PLATES FROM A RESTAURANT SUPPLY PLACE BECAUSE I KNOW THEY WILL BE QUITE DURABLE ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND FOR CERAMIC OR GLASS ITEMS IS THERMAL SHOCK WHICH IS WHERE YOU SUDDENLY CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE LIKE SAY TAKE A DEGREE GLASS PAN AND DROP SOME ICE WATER ONTO IT THAT KIND OF THING CAN RESULT IN SUDDEN CRACKING TO THE POINT THAT THE PAN FALLS APART OR EVEN FLYING GLASS VERY BAD
YOU RUN THE RISK OF CRACKING IT AND IF IT DOESN'T CRACK THEN THERE'S EITHER OTHER EFFECTS OR IT'S OVEN SAFE CERAMIC WARE
LAST DINNER BEFORE INDUCING LABOR
I WILL HAVE TO TRY THIS I AM VEGETARIAN BUT LOVE CHEESE SO IT WILL BE NICE TO SEE IF IT TASTES JUST THE SAME
OOF I'LL TAKE MINE WITH A SCOOP OF VANILLA ICE CREAM PLEASE
