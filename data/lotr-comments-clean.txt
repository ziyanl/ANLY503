THE ONLY BILL I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IS BILL THE PONY
BUT LORD OF THE RINGS WAS THE GREATEST POLITICAL ALLEGORY OF ITS TIME EACH CHARACTER AND OBJECT REPRESENTED EXACTLY WHAT TZOLKIN CONSIDERED TO BE HIS CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION PARTICULARLY THE ONE RING AND IT APPLIES EVEN TODAY

I NEED TO GO TAKE A SHOWER NOW

GOOD CHOICE MODS THANKS FOR YOUR HARD WORK
SARON DID NOTHING WRONG



NOW THAT I'VE GOTTEN THAT OUT OF MY SYSTEM BEHIND THIS THANKS FOR YOUR HARD WORK MODS
JUST TO ECHO MY SENTIMENTS WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT US POLITICS IS A REALLY POLARISING ISSUE THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER PLACES TO DISCUSS IT PLEASE DON'T BRING POLITICS INTO OUR OR ANY SUBREDDIT WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG
LOOKS LIKE MEAT'S BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW HAPPY I AM ABOUT THIS I AM JUST SO FATIGUED AFTER SEEING IT EVERYWHERE AND ANY TIME YOU MENTION THAT A CERTAIN SUB HAS NO NEED FOR POLITICS YOU GET DOWNVOTED BY PEOPLE THINKING YOU ARE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THEM
THANK FUCKING GOD I WISH MORE SUBS WERE WILLING TO DO THIS THIS ELECTION SEEMS TO BE ESPECIALLY BAD IN TERMS OF POLITICS LEAKING INTO EVERY SUB IMAGINABLE
SOMEONE PUT UP A POLITICAL MEME ON TOLKIENFANS A FEW DAYS AGO I WAS NOT PLEASED WHEN WE GET SHITPOSTS I KNOW YOU LOT ARE GETTING THEM IN SPADES
MAKE ERECTOR GREAT AGAIN
NEVER SARON

OR

SARON IS CLEARLY THE LESSER OF 2 EVILS
THIS IS JUST THE SORT OF CENSORSHIP WE'VE COME TO EXPECT FROM THE CONSPIRACY THAT RUNS THIS SUB AND IS DEDICATED TO KEEPING THE TRUTH FROM GETTING OUT
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR WOULD IT BE OKAY TO POST POLITICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF WORK
VIEWS ON POLITICS AND ESPECIALLY ON ANARCHISM ARE FASCINATING BUT THERE ARE OTHER TZOLKIN RELATED SUBS FOR THAT
BTW WHAT GOLLUM MEME
UNLESS OF COURSE THE POLITICS IN QUESTION HAPPEN BETWEEN NATIONS IN MIDDLE EARTH LIKE DENETHOR REFUSING TO GIVE UP HIS STEWARDSHIP ETC RIGHT
PLEASE TELL THIS TO THE SPORTS SUBS SUCH A GREAT IDEA


MELIOR DID NOTHING WRONG

SAM FOR MAYOR
VOTE ARAGON
YOU ROCK I AM HIGHLY POLITICAL BUT I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A TIME AND A PLACE PEOPLE DON'T NEED THAT STUFF IN THEIR FACE OF THE TIME AND WE DON'T NEED TO BE DIVIDED IN SPACES WHERE WE MIGHT OTHERWISE BE BUILDING CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER GROUPS
WAY TO GO MODS MAKING MIDDLE-EARTH GREAT AGAIN
I WHOLEHEARTEDLY APPLAUD THIS DECISION I REALLY WISH MORE SUBREDDITS DID THE SAME THING OR RATHER I WISH IT WASN'T NECESSARY TO HAVE TO DO SO IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
GG MODS
I'M JUST SAYING A TEMPORARY BAN ON ALL IMMIGRATION OF ARAD AND CHUN PEOPLE
MAKE CONDOR GREAT AGAIN
THE TRUE AGGRESSORS FOR WAR WERE NEVER THE ORCS IT WAS SARON AND SAURURAN THEY CONTROLLED THE PURSES
QUESTION FOR THE MODS HERE WOULD A JOKE IN THE COMMENTS WHICH ALLUDES TO A POLITICS BUT ISN'T SUPPORTING ANY PARTICULAR VIEW LIKE SAYING MAKE CONDOR GREAT AGAIN OR BUILD A WALL BETWEEN ISENGARD AND ROHAN COUNT AS AN INFRACTION TO THAT RULE
THANK YOU MODS FOR GIVING US A SANCTUARY DURING THE SILLY SEASON
WE'LL BUILD A WALL AND GET MORDOR TO PAY FOR IT
DARN IT I WAS JUST GOING TO POST WHAT CAN MAN DO AGAINST SUCH RECKLESS HATE
IS RANDOLF A CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL
ARAGON FOR KING
BUT LORD OF THE RINGS IS THE GREATEST GEOPOLITICAL COMMENTARY OF THE PAST GENERATIONS
YEAH WE CAN BUILD A WALL TO KEEP OUT THE POLITICAL FUCK
SO IS IT AGAINST THE RULES NOW TO MENTION THAT JNR TZOLKIN IN REAL LIFE WAS A ROYALIST WHO ARDENTLY SUPPORTED THE BRITISH QUEEN AND HER CROWN FAMILY SEEMS LIKE A RELEVANT FACT IN LIGHT OF HIS REVERENCE FOR ROYAL BLOOD IN LOAR
CONGRATS ITALIA EXCELLENT CHOICE
THANKS

HELLO EVERYONE
GREAT CHOICE HE'S BEEN HEADING THE READING DISCUSSION FOR LOAR OVER AT R TOLKIENFANS HE DOES A GOOD JOB OVER THERE
MY BID IS CASH ON DELIVERY UP TO AND NOT EXCEEDING ONE FOURTEENTH OF TOTAL PROFITS AND ALL DELIVERY EXPENSES GUARANTEED IN ANY EVENT
I WORSHIP THIS DUDE RANGER TOO LAZY TO SOURCE BUT HE BOW HUNTS MUCH ALL OF HIS ANIMAL PROTEIN
I ALSO HEARD HE BOUGHT THE HORSE FROM HIDALGO HOW MANY HORSES HAS THIS MAN BOUGHT
AND ROLLING AROUND IN THE DIRT PLAYING WITH HIS HORSEY ONLY HELPED HIS COSTUME AND APPEARANCE IM SURE
TOUGH GUY WARRIOR POET CLASS ACT
HE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE PERFECT
IJO MORGANSTEIN
IF SHE COULDN'T AFFORD TO BUY THE HORSE WAS SHE ABLE TO AFFORD TO MAINTAIN IT
I NEVER GET TIRED OF HEARING THIS STORY
I LIKE THAT SONG WHEN HE IS REVIVED ON THE RIVERBED THE VOICE OF THE SINGER IS AMAZING
AGAINST THE POWER OF MORDOR THERE CAN BE NO VICTORY

YOUR LOVE OF THE HALFLINGS LEAF HAS CLEARLY SLOWED YOUR MIND
WE ALL KNOW IT'S THE ANSWER IT'S SAURURAN
YOU WILL TASTE
PUT TOGETHER A GROUP OF ABOUT EH VOLUNTEERS TO HIKE UP THERE AND FIND OUT
I BET THE SHORTER LADIES LOVED GETTING DWARF RINGS
NOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK FOR THE RULING RING IN SOME LOCAL CAVES MAKE SURE YOU KNOW SOME RIDDLES AND DONT GET SQUEEZED
DWARF RINGS DWARF RINGS

I'M GLAD I'M TALL
AS A FAIRLY SHORT WOMEN I DON'T THINK I'D APPRECIATE A DWARF RING
THIS IS AWESOME
SO NOW THE CLASS REP HAS POWER OVER THE GUYS WHO LOST THEIR HUMAN RINGS COOL
GOOD LITTLE STORY
ALL THE RINGS WERE ORIGINALLY MADE FOR ELVES SO YOU COULD ALL HAVE BEEN ELVES
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE SOME DEEP POST ABOUT HOW WE'VE ALL LOST OUR WAY AS A SPECIES AND TRUMP IS SARON ABOUT TO COME FORTH WITH HIS ORC ARMY LOL

NOT TRYING TO HATE ON TRUMP SUPPORTERS OR START ANYTHING POLITICAL IF I HAD VOTED I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE EVEN VOTED FOR THE GUY TSH
SO ALL THE GUYS LOST THEIR RING WELL I'M SURE THERE'S BEEN NO SCHEMING FROM THE LADIES WHATSOEVER
R THATHAPPENED
BANE GOT ITS NAME FOR SLAYING AURIN VI

AURIN VI DIED YEARS BEFORE BALIN WAS BORN

AURIN I LIVED BETWEEN AND YEARS BEFORE BALIN WAS BORN

THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE FELLOWSHIP ALIVE AT THE SAME TIME WAS GANDALF AND HE HAD NOT TAKEN THE FORM OR NAME OF GANDALF YET
THE BARONG IS IMMORTAL AURIN AND BALIN WERE NOT CONTEMPORARIES WITH EACH OTHER BUT EVERYONE SINCE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD UP UNTIL GANDALF DEFEATS IT WAS CONTEMPORARY WITH THE BARONG THAT'S WHY IT'S ABLE TO KILL PEOPLE AGES AGO BUT STILL BE AROUND TO KILL MORE PEOPLE NOW ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T AURIN I AND ALSO THE BARONG DIDN'T KILL BALIN EITHER THAT WAS ORCS THE BARONG GOT ITS NAME CENTURIES BEFORE WHEN THE DWARVES UNCOVERED IT AND IT KILLED THEM THE STORY WAS REMEMBERED AND TOLD BY THE SURVIVORS UNTIL IT BECAME A WELL-KNOWN PART OF THEIR HERITAGE THEN HUNDREDS OF YEARS LATER WHEN ALL THE DWARVES WHO UNCOVERED THE BARONG WERE LONG DEAD BALIN LEAD AN EXPEDITION BACK TO MORIA BUT THE BARONG WAS STILL ALIVE AND WELL THERE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T AGE IF NOT FOR GANDALF IT COULD HAVE STILL BEEN THERE YEARS LATER WHEN ALL THE CURRENT DWARVES ARE LONG DEAD
BANE DID IN FACT SLAY AURIN THE VI NOT AURIN I

HOWEVER WHO THE BARONG SLAYED IS ACTUALLY IRRELEVANT TO COMMENT HIS COUSIN BALIN ALONG WITH ORI AND OTHER DWARVES LED AN EXPEDITION TO RETAKE MORIA SOMETIME AFTER THE QUEST FOR ERECTOR EVENTS OF THE HOBBIT GIMLI ALONG WITH MANY DWARVES WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE EXPEDITION WAS LEAST TO SOME EXTENT THAT'S WHY HE IS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT BALIN IS DEAD ALONG WITH HIS COLONY

WIKI FOR MORE READING IF YOU WOULD LIKE ON COLONY
WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY ON R TOLKIENFANS AND I QUOTED THIS LETTER YOU MAY FIND INTERESTING

LETTER

FRODO WAS SENT OR ALLOWED TO PASS OVER SEA TO HEAL HIM IF THAT COULD BE DONE BEFORE
HE DIED HE WOULD HAVE EVENTUALLY TO PASS AWAY NO MORTAL COULD OR CAN ABIDE FOR EVER ON EARTH
OR WITHIN TIME SO HE WENT BOTH TO A PURGATORY AND TO A REWARD FOR A WHILE A PERIOD OF REFLECTION
AND PEACE AND A GAINING OF A TRUER UNDERSTANDING OF HIS POSITION IN LITTLENESS AND IN GREATNESS SPENT
STILL IN TIME AMID THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF ARDA UNMARRED THE EARTH UNSPOILED BY EVIL

BILBO WENT TOO NO DOUBT AS A COMPLETION OF THE PLAN DUE TO GANDALF HIMSELF GANDALF HAD A
VERY GREAT AFFECTION FOR BILBO FROM THE CHILDHOOD ONWARDS HIS COMPANIONSHIP WAS REALLY
NECESSARY FOR SAKE IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A HOBBIT EVEN ONE WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH
EXPERIENCES BEING REALLY HAPPY EVEN IN AN EARTHLY PARADISE WITHOUT A COMPANION OF HIS OWN
KIND AND BILBO WAS THE PERSON THAT FRODO MOST LOVED CF III LINES TO AND LINES 2


BUT HE ALSO NEEDED AND DESERVED THE FAVOUR ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE BORE STILL THE MARK OF THE RING
THAT NEEDED TO BE FINALLY ERASED A TRACE OF PRIDE AND PERSONAL POSSESSIVENESS OF COURSE HE WAS OLD
AND CONFUSED IN MIND BUT IT WAS STILL A REVELATION OF THE BLACK MARK WHEN HE SAID IN RIVENDELL III
WHAT'S BECOME OF MY RING FRODO THAT YOU TOOK AWAY AND WHEN HE WAS REMINDED OF WHAT
HAD HAPPENED HIS IMMEDIATE REPLY WAS WHAT A PITY I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE IT AGAIN AS FOR
REWARD FOR HIS PAN IT IS DIFFICULT TO FEEL THAT HIS LIFE WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT AN EXPERIENCE OF
PURE ELFISHNESS AND THE OPPORTUNITY OF HEARING THE LEGENDS AND HISTORIES IN FULL THE FRAGMENTS OFWHICH HAD SO DELIGHTED HIM

IT IS CLEAR OF COURSE THAT THE PLAN HAD ACTUALLY BEEN MADE AND CONCERTED BY ARWEN GANDALF
AND OTHERS BEFORE ARWEN SPOKE BUT FRODO DID NOT IMMEDIATELY TAKE IT IN THE IMPLICATIONS WOULD
SLOWLY BE UNDERSTOOD ON REFLECTION SUCH A JOURNEY WOULD AT FIRST SEEM SOMETHING NOT NECESSARILY TO
BE FEARED EVEN AS SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO SO LONG AS UNDATED AND POSTPONABLE HIS REAL
DESIRE WAS HOBBITLIKE AND HUMANLIKE JUST TO BE HIMSELF AGAIN AND GET BACK TO THE OLD FAMILIAR LIFE
THAT HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED ALREADY ON THE JOURNEY BACK FROM RIVENDELL HE SUDDENLY SAW THAT WAS NOT
FOR HIM POSSIBLE HENCE HIS CRY WHERE SHALL I FIND REST HE KNEW THE ANSWER AND GANDALF DID NOT
REPLY AS FOR BILBO IT IS PROBABLE THAT FRODO DID NOT AT FIRST UNDERSTAND WHAT ARWEN MEANT BY HE
WILL NOT AGAIN MAKE ANY LONG JOURNEY SAVE ONE AT ANY RATE HE DID NOT ASSOCIATE IT WITH HIS OWN
CASE WHEN ARWEN SPOKE IN TA HE WAS STILL YOUNG NOT YET AND BILBO YEARS OLDER BUT
AT RIVENDELL HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THINGS MORE CLEARLY THE CONVERSATIONS HE HAD THERE ARE NOT
REPORTED BUT ENOUGH IS REVEALED IN FAREWELL III
FROM THE ONSET OF THE FIRST SICKNESS
OCTOBER FRODO MUST HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT SAILING THOUGH STILL RESISTING A FINAL DECISION
TO GO WITH BILBO OR TO GO AT ALL IT WAS NO DOUBT AFTER HIS GRIEVOUS ILLNESS IN MARCH THAT HIS
MIND WAS MADE UP


I WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT SO MUCH A SUICIDE AS SIMPLY DECIDING TO MOVE ON FROM THIS LIFE I THINK I HAVE HEARD OF THIS TYPE OF THING HAPPENING IN OLD PEOPLE ONE DAY THEY SIMPLY DECIDE THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER NEEDED ON EARTH AND THEY HAVE NO REASON TO CONTINUE ONE HERE AND SO THEY JUST PASS AWAY I KNOW THAT MY GREAT GRAMPA STARTED SAYING HIS GOODBYES A LITTLE LESS THAN A WEEK BEFORE HE PASSED

I WOULDN'T CALL THAT A SUICIDE SIMPLY MOVING ON TO THE NEXT STEP
THE ENDING IS PRETTY MUCH A SUICIDE TRIP THEY WOULD NOT COME BACK FROM THE WESTERN LANDS THEY WERE SENT THERE TO HELP HEAL THE DAMAGE THE RING HAS DONE THO THEM I CAN TOTALLY SEE THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THAT AND A SOLDIER COMING HOME WITH SEVERE PTSD AND WANTING A WAY TO HEAL



AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY A PLANED SEQUEL TO THE TRILOGY CALLED THE NEW SHADOW

I DID BEGIN A STORY PLACED ABOUT YEARS AFTER THE DOWNFALL BUT IT PROVED BOTH SINISTER AND DEPRESSING SINCE WE ARE DEALING WITH MEN IT IS INEVITABLE THAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH THE MOST REGRETTABLE FEATURE OF THEIR NATURE THEIR QUICK SATIETY WITH GOOD SO THAT THE PEOPLE OF CONDOR IN TIMES OF PEACE JUSTICE AND PROSPERITY WOULD BECOME DISCONTENTED AND RESTLESS WHILE THE DYNASTS DESCENDED FROM ARAGON WOULD BECOME JUST KINGS AND GOVERNORS LIKE DENETHOR OR WORSE I FOUND THAT EVEN SO EARLY THERE WAS AN OUTCROP OF REVOLUTIONARY PLOTS ABOUT A CENTRE OF SECRET SATANISTIC RELIGION WHILE GONDORIAN BOYS WERE PLAYING AT BEING ORCS AND GOING AROUND DOING DAMAGE I COULD HAVE WRITTEN A THRILLER ABOUT THE PLOT AND ITS DISCOVERY AND OVERTHROW BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST THAT NOT WORTH DOING
THE LETTERS OF J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN LETTER


IT WAS ONLY PAGES AND IT WAS QUICKLY ABANDONED BY TZOLKIN
WHO THE FUCK IS GONNA READ ALL THAT
MY RECOMMENDATION IS USUALLY TO JUST READ THROUGH THE IMPORTANT NAMES AND PLACES COME UP OFTEN ENOUGH YOU'LL START TO REMEMBER WHO'S WHO

THEN ON A REREAD EVERYTHING CLICKS
THIS IS A PRETTY DECENT BLOG ON IT ALL
ITS A BIT LIKE THE BIBLE OR A GREEK HISTORY HERODTODUS MOST OF THE STORY IS FROM A FEW STEPS BACK BUT EVERY SO OFTEN IT ZOOMS IN AND DESCRIBES INDIVIDUAL FIGHTS CONVERSATIONS ETC

BUT YOU HAVEN'T READ LOAR YET CORRECT START WITH THE HOBBIT AND LOAR BEFORE JUMPING INTO THE SILMARILLION
I FOUND I COULDN'T GET ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT READING IT AS IF IT WAS ONE OF MORE FAMOUS WORKS I HAD TO APPROACH IT AS A COURSE OF STUDY IT'S INFORMATION DENSE AND WRITTEN IN A STYLE THAT IS NOT POPULAR TODAY THEIR IS A TENDENCY TO JUDGE IT BY THE SAME STANDARDS AS HIS OTHER WORKS BUT IT IS REALLY A DIFFERENT TYPE OF BOOK IT IS MORE THAN WORTH THE EFFORT TO MAKE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THOUGH JUST GO SLOWLY AND TRY NOT TO ZIP PAST STUFF WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT STUDY IT LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO ACE THE EXAM AND YOU'LL COME AWAY WITH A FOUNDATION TO HELP YOU BETTER APPRECIATE HIS OTHER WORKS
I FOUND IT TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO READING THE BIBLE ONLY LESS PREACHY
THE FIRST PART WAS THE TOUGHEST FOR ME I READ IT ABOUT YEARS AGO AND HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GETTING IN TO THOUGH THE FIRST SECTION READS LIKE A CREATION STORY IN A BIBLE LOTS OF ABSTRACT IMAGERY AND SUCH BUT ONCE I GOT THROUGH IT IT MADE SENSE AND I ENJOYED IT

THE REST OF THE BOOK IS SHORT INTERCONNECTED STORIES ABOUT ANCIENT PEOPLE THIS IS THE AMAZING PART OF THE BOOK AND HOOKED ME INSTANTLY THERE ARE A LOT OF NAMES AND LOCATIONS TO REMEMBER BUT IT ISN'T A PROBLEM JUST FOCUS ON THE STORY I FLIPPED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE STORY AND INDEX CONSTANTLY AND WHILE I EVENTUALLY MEMORIZED ALL THE NAMES AND LOCATIONS IT WASN'T A GREAT WAY TO READ THE BOOK

IF YOU LOVE TZOLKIN ENOUGH TO WANT TO READ THE SILMARILLION I AM SURE YOU WILL REALLY LIKE IT AND WILL WANT TO READ IT AGAIN SOME TIME THAT IS WHEN YOU CAN FOCUS ON LEARNING THE NAMES AND PLACES
FINISHED THE SILMARILLION TWO DAYS AGO
I DIDN'T FIND IT THAT HARD AND EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING ENGLISH IS NOT MY MOTHER TONGUE AND I HAD NO PROBLEM WITH IT CONCERNING THE NAMES SOME YOU CAN FORGET IMMEDIATELY FAMILY TREES HELP GETTING THROUGH IT
IN THE END IT GIVES YOU A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF MIDDLE-EARTH SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AND IT'S ALSO ENTERTAINING AND NOT JUST STUDDING
IFS LIKE A BUNCH OF SHORT STORIES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE WHOLE STORY
TO ANYONE WHO HAS WATCHED ALL OF THE SPECIAL FEATURES THIS ISN'T NEWS STILL FUNNY THAT IT CONTINUES THOUGH
HOW EXACTLY IS IT A PRANK THOUGH
THE ELVES IN KIRKWOOD SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME AS A CHILD
SAME STUDIO THAT DID THE LAST UNICORN IF YOU ARE INTO THE ARTICLE
DOWN DOWN TO YOU GO MY LAD HO-HO MY LAD
I REMEMBER SEEING AND LOVING THE CARTOONS AT RANDOM WHEN I WAS A KID IT WAS DECADES BEFORE I FIGURED OUT WHAT THEY WERE A LITTLE SEASONING FOR YOUR NOSTALGIA

WATCH V AF
THE GREATEST ADVENTURE IS THERE IF YOU'RE BOLD LET GO OF THE MOMENT THAT LIFE MAKES YOU HOLD
LOVE THIS MOVIE IT HAS ITS FLAWS BUT IT BRINGS THE TONE OF THE BOOK TO LIFE IN A WAY THE JACKSON VERSION STRUGGLED TO DO I THINK INCORPORATING SO MANY OF SONGS REALLY HELPED IN THIS RESPECT

THAT'S WHAT GOT ME STARTED
I HAVE A COPY OF THE HOBBIT ILLUSTRATED WITH SCENES FROM THE CARTOON
I GREW UP WITH THIS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT I REMEMBER WHEN I READ THE BOOK EVENTUALLY I WAS BLOWN AWAY THAT THE SONGS IN THE CARTOON ARE ACTUALLY IN THE BOOK

I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS ARE REGARDING THE FELLOWSHIP AND TWO TOWERS CARTOON BUT I ADORE IT SOME OF THE SCARIEST AND STRANGEST ANIMATION YOU WILL EVER SEE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SCENES IN THAT CARTOON THAT I THINK ARE FAR SUPERIOR THAN THE MOVIE ADAPTATION
I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS AND THEIR VERSION OF RETURN OF THE KING
THEY KILLED OFF SO MANY DWARVES THOUGH AND NO BEHORN
I LOVE THIS MOVIE
WHERE CAN I WATCH THIS IN CANADA
STILL BETTER THAN THE MOVIES
THIS CARTOON FEELS SO CLOSE TO THE BOOKS I ALSO MUCH PREFER IT TO THE PETER JACKSON TRILOGY

ALSO LOVE THE SOUNDTRACK THE GREATEST ADVENTURE AND ROADS GO EVER EVER ON ARE AMAZING NO SARCASM
WE STILL HAVE THE RECORD THEY MADE OUT OF THIS MOVIE
I STILL WISH THAT PETER JACKSON HAD TAKEN THIS MOVIE AND FILMED IT LIVE ACTION MAYBE HE STILL WILL THE HOBBIT CLASSIC EDITION
I STILL WANT TO WATCH THIS ADAPTATION OF IT I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND IT ANYWHERE
THERE USED TO BE A REALLY NICE VERSION OF THE HOBBIT BOOK AND IT HAD ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THIS MOVIE IN IT DOES ANYONE REMEMBER IT ANYONE HAVE A LINK TO PURCHASE IT IT WAS A HARDCOVER I THINK
U FEARTHEBEARD

WELL HECK
THIS MOVIE WAS WAY BETTER THEN THAT RECENT HOBBIT TRILOGY
I REALLY LIKE IT BUT THE CHARACTERS LOOK SO HIDEOUS DAMN MUSIC IS AWESOME THOUGH
LOVED RIDDLES IN THE DARK THE VOICE ACTOR FOR GOLLUM NAILED IT ALSO SMUG SUCH GREAT VOICE ACTORS
THE WAY GANDALF NONCHALANTLY SAYS EXCELLENT AFTER THE TROLLS GET TURNED TO STONE WAS ALWAYS HILARIOUS TO ME
AND I WAS THERE I SAVED THE COPY OF TV GUIDE FOR YEARS AFTER THIS IT HAD A HALF PAGE AD FOR THE MOVIE AND I COULDN'T BEAR THE THOUGHT OF THROWING IT AWAY I STILL HAVE THE BOXED SET OF LP'S INCLUDING THE FOLD OUT POSTER

THIS MOVIE GETS GRIEF I THINK IN PART OF THE UNCONVENTIONAL ANIMATION STYLE I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND THE EYES BUT IT IS FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK AND TELLS THE STORY EFFECTIVELY EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD TO COMPLETELY CUT TAURINE OUT I SUPPOSE FOR REASONS OF TIME
THE MUSIC WAS EPIC FOR THIS CARTOON I NEED TO FIND ME A COPY OF THIS
LEMIWINKS
THIS WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO MIDDLE-EARTH WHEN I WAS ABOUT OR YEARS OLD MY DAD SAT ME DOWN TO WATCH IT I ADORED IT THEN AND I DO SO NOW RICHARD BOONE AS SMUG WAS ABSOLUTELY EPIC



WHEN THEY WERE MAKING THE JACKSON TRILOGY I PHONED MY DAD TO TELL HIM I SAID IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE SOMETHING WITH LOAR BUT THAT JACKSON HAD A BIG JOB AHEAD OF HIM TO DO A BETTER JOB I WAS RIGHT AND I THINK JACKSON DROPPED THE BALL
THE ONLY ADAPTION OF THE BOOK
MINE TOO
WHO WEARS SHORT SHORTS
BOOMIER APPARENTLY
I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT IF YOU SAW IT AS A KID YOU STILL ASSOCIATE IT WITH THE NOSTALGIA AND NAIVETE OF YOUTH IF YOU WAITED UNTIL YOU WERE AN ADULT TO SEE IT LIKE ME IT'S A FILLER IN YOUR TZOLKIN COLLECTION BUT NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT

I PERSONALLY CAN'T STAND IT
I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT HE REPEATEDLY CALLS SAURURAN THE GREATEST ENEMY OF THE FELLOWSHIP IS THAT TRUE DID I MISS SOMETHING I THOUGHT IT WAS SARON BUT I GUESS ONE COULD SAY THAT SARON WAS THE GREATEST ENEMY OF MIDDLE EARTH AS A WHOLE WHEREAS SAURURAN WAS THE LARGEST OBSTACLE TO THE WORKINGS OF THE FELLOWSHIP WOULD SOMEONE MORE EDUCATED CARE TO SET ME STRAIGHT
I LOVE THIS MAN SO MUCH IT WAS MY DREAM TO MEET HIM AND LISTEN TO HIS STORIES SUCH A SHAME I DIDN'T MAKE IT
THE OBSESSION BURNS BRIGHT WITH THIS ONE WELCOME BACK TO THE FELLOWSHIP BROTHER
COULD YOU TELL SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THE MAPS
THIS IS AMAZING

I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT I'M MISSING

I SEE MOUNT DOOM MINAS TIGRISH ISENGARD THE ARGONAUT THE LONELY MOUNTAIN

THEY'RE THE ONLY THINGS I'M ON OTHER THAN OBVIOUS THINGS LIKE THE MISTY MOUNTAINS EAGLES ETC

IS MINAS ITHIEL RIVENDELL HOBBITON ON HERE BUT I'M JUST MISSING THEM
THIS IS INCREDIBLE HOW WOULD ONE GO ABOUT PURCHASING A PRINT OR IS THAT NOT AN OPTION
I WANT ONE HOW CAN A MAN BUY THIS FROM A COUNTRY THAT AMAZON DOESN'T SHIPS
IT'S BEAUTIFUL WORK BUT FOR JUST A MOMENT I THOUGHT IT WAS MEANT TO DEPICT A RING TOSS GAME
OH FUCK DO I NEED TO COP ONE OF THESE
I HAVE FAILED AS A HUSBAND IF I CANNOT FIND A WAY TO GET ONE FOR MY WIFE
GLAD TO SEE THIS IS GETTING SOME LOVE THIS IS ACTUALLY A PIECE OF WORK THAT WAS PRIVATELY COMMISSIONED FROM A GROUP OF FANS LIMITED TO OR SO FOLKS IN THE GROUP AS FAR AS I KNOW THE PRINTS WILL NOT BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FOR SALE

HE KINDA LOOKS LIKE HE'S JERKING OFF LOL
HE LOOKS LIKE HE COULD FOLD UNDER PRESSURE
I REEEEEAAALLY HATE TO SAY IT BUT IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE AN EKWOK
HOW ABOUT THE ANNIVERSARY DELUXE EDITION
ISBN
IT'S MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE PLUS IT FITS TOGETHER WITH OTHER BOOKS OF THE LEGENDARIUM IF YOU WANT THEM
I ASKED FOR THE SAME THING A FEW YEARS AGO MY SON DID A BUNCH OF RESEARCH AND THEY BOUGHT ME THIS AND THIS THEY'RE GORGEOUS THE PAPER IS A SO RICH FEELING
THE FOLIO SOCIETY EDITION IS VERY NICE ONE VOLUME FOR EACH PART WE GOT THEM FOR MY MUM WHEN SHE TURNED AND SHE LOVES THEM STURDY PRINT GREAT ILLUSTRATIONS
THIS LOOKS PRETTY NICE ON A SHELF BUT THE ILLUSTRATIONS BY ALAN LEE ARE TRULY AMAZING THIS IS MY FAVORITE EDITION OF THE BOOK SOMETIMES I JUST TAKE IT OFF MY SHELF AND LOOK THROUGH THE ILLUSTRATIONS

IF YOU CLICK HERE YOU CAN SEE THE IMAGES SOMEONE TOOK OF THE BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS
THEY DID IN THE BOOKS
THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF ARAGON GATHERING THE PATHBREAKER ARMY SO THEY COULD DRIVE OFF THE CORSAIRS HARADRIM OR WHATEVER FROM THE OTHER GONDORIAN CITIES AND GATHER THE TROOPS FROM THOSE AREAS
IN THE MOVIE THEY KIND OF HINT AT MADNESS WHEN GANDALF ASKS WHERE ARE ARMIES BUT IN THE BOOK THE ARMIES ARE THERE
LORDS FROM VARIOUS PROVINCES DID GO TO MINAS TIGRISH

FURLONG THE FAT THE LORD OF LOSSARNACH A MAN OF WIDE SHOULDERS AND HUGE GIRTH BUT OLD AND YET AND AND BEARING A LONG HEAVY SPEAR BEHIND HIM MARCHED PROUDLY A DUSTY LINE OF MEN MEN OF RINGLE VALE BEHIND THE SON OF THEIR LORD DEVONIAN STRIDING ON FOOT FROM THE UPLANDS OF MORTHOND THE GREAT BLACKROOT VALE TALL DUINHIR WITH HIS SONS DUALIN AND DERUFIN AND FIVE HUNDRED BOWMEN FROM THE ALFALFAS THE LANGSTRAND FAR AWAY SCANTILY EQUIPPED SAVE FOR THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOLASGIL THEIR LORD HIRUDIN THE FAIR OF THE GREEN HILLS FROM PENNATE CELIN LAST AND PROUDEST IMRAHIL PRINCE OF DOL AGOROTH KINSMAN OF THE LORD BEHIND THEM SEVEN HUNDREDS OF MEN AT ARMS TALL AS LORDS DARK-HAIRED MINAS TIGRISH

THE COMBINED HOSTS WERE LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND HOWEVER
IT'S COOL BUT OUT OF CURIOSITY WHY MIX THE WHITE TREE OF CONDOR WITH THE INSCRIPTION FOR THE OF MORIA
I LOVE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THIS IS PERGOLAS
I USED TO HAVE MY FRIENDS DAD CUT US WOOD VERSIONS OF ALL AND ARAGORNS SWORDS
IS BILL THE PONY A CUSTOM
WHERE DID U BUY THAT
HELLO
I BELIEVE THIS WAS A DELETED SCENE THAT WAS INTENDED TO ILLUSTRATE THE EVENTS TAKEN PLACE FROM THE ESCAPE OF MORIA TO THE WOODS OF LORIEN IN THE BOOKS THE FELLOWSHIP WAS CHASED ALL THE WAY TO LOTHLORIEN BY ORCS AND GOBLINS WOULD HAVE MADE AN AWESOME SCENE IN THE MOVIE
SORRY IF THIS ISN'T THE MOST INTERESTING POST

I HAVE THIS ART PIECE THAT HAS A FILM CELL FROM THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING IN IT HOWEVER I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT SCENE THIS CELL IS IN IT'S ODD BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE BOOMIER IS ON THE LEFT WITH A SWORD OUT TWO HOBBITS IN THE MIDDLE AND PERGOLAS PLUS ARAGON ON THE RIGHT THIS IS ALL IN A WOODED AREA WHAT SCENE COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE FROM THE ONLY WOODED PLACE I CAN REMEMBER THE FELLOWSHIP BEING AT IN THE MOVIE BESIDES LOTHLORIAN IS AT THE END I'VE SKIMMED THROUGH THE AMON HEN SCENES AND DIDN'T SEE THIS AT ALL MAYBE I WAS BLIND OR MAYBE ITS AT A DIFFERENT PART IN THE MOVIE
BETSY WOULD BE YOUR BEST BET LOTS OF HANDMADE JOURNALS IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE SIZE YOU WANT YOU COULD COMMISSION ONE TO BE MADE
NOPE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT THEY'RE SCREWED DESTROYING OR USING THE RING ARE THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS
NOPE THE WHOLE POINT WAS THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE BUT THAT THEY KEPT FIGHTING ANYWAY
THE LAST ALLIANCE WAS THE LAST TIME THE FREE PEOPLES HAD ENOUGH STRENGTH TO DEFEAT SARON THE THIRD AGE WAS JUST THEM HOLDING OFF THE ONSLAUGHT IN HOPE OF DESTROYING THE RING HAD THE RING NOT BEEN FOUND SARON WOULD HAVE EVENTUALLY UNLEASHED A LARGER ARMY ON MINAS TIGRISH AND ASSUMING ROHAN STILL DEFEATED SAURURAN SARON WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THEM TOO
A VAT IS DEFINED AS A LARGE TANK OR TUB OFTEN USED TO STORE LIQUIDS IT IS MOST COMMONLY USED IN REFERENCE TO LARGE FACTORIES THAT HAVE TO STORE COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF COLORED DYES OR REALLY ANY LIQUID THAT WAS JUST AN EXAMPLE

MY GUESS IS THAT THIS IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE WRITERS FOR SOM HAVING NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ORCS REPRODUCE SEXUALLY BUT I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN THE WRITERS OF THE GAME JUST ASSUMED THAT P WAS CORRECT IN DEPICTING THEM POPPING OUT OF MUD PITS AND SO THEY COPIED THAT

AS A GENERAL RULE DON'T TRUST ANYTHING THAT YOU LEARN FROM SOM IN TERMS OF LORE IT IS VERY PROBABLY WRONG
SOUNDS LIKE A REFERENCE TO THOSE DUMB MUD PITS FROM THE MOVIES WHERE THEY MAKE MORE ORCS

I
I BOUGHT IT FOR JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING IN BUT I REMEMBER IT WENT ON SALE AGAIN AT SOME POINT DURING DECEMBER THE PRICE PROBABLY WILL DROP AGAIN SOON
SAW SOMEONE RECOMMEND THIS RECENTLY AND THOUGHT OF THIS POST HERE IS A CHROME EXTENSION THAT WILL ALERT YOU WHEN AMAZON DROPS THE PRICE ON SOMETHING YOU'RE TRACKING HAPPY SHOPPING

DOES ANYONE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO SETS
THIS ONE IS MORE EXPENSIVE
DP REF IE DTF QID SR KEYWORDS LORD OF THE RINGS EXTENDED EDITION

BUT THIS ONE LOOKS THE SAME BUT IS A LOT CHEAPER
DP REF IE DTF QID SR KEYWORDS LORD OF THE RINGS EXTENDED EDITION


A GREAT IDEA POST IF YOU FIND ANYTHING

I HAVE A PROFESSIONAL SCAN OF THE IMAGE GIVE ME A MESSAGE IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED AND I MIGHT LOOK AT DOING SOME PRINTS OR PUTTING IT ON BETSY
NOW THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF AMAZING JOB
DECIDED TO DO A SMALL NUMBER OF PRINTS TAKE A LOOK HERE

OR JUST GIVE ME A MESSAGE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING I LOVE SEEING ON THIS SUBREDDIT INCREDIBLE WORK
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING TO CHERISH FOR A LIFETIME
REALLY PHENOMENAL WORK THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF I LOVE THE COLOR IN THE MOUNTAINS AND FIELDS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER PROJECT I BELIEVE BELERIAND AND THE LANDS TO THE NORTH NEED DRAWING
REALLY AMAZING NICE WORK
THAT LOOKS AMAZING
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC TZOLKIN WOULD BE PLEASED
GORGEOUS
INCREDIBLE
AN IDEA FOR YOUR AMAZING MAP YOU COULD TRY TO CUT OUT THE LAND AND PUT THOSE SMALL CM RAISED CUSHION SQUARES WITH GLUE ON BOTH SIDES AND PASTE IT ON TOP OF WHITE BACKGROUND WHERE YOU HAVE THE MIDDLE EARTH AND THE COMPASS ROSE

THAT WAY I RECKON YOU CAN GET A COOL 3D EFFECT
I THINK THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I'VE SEEN FANTASTIC WORK
YOU FORGOT NEW ZEALAND
THIS IS WONDERFUL WORK I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE USE OF COLOUR
IF CURIOUS THE OFFICIAL PROP GUYS FOR THE MOVIES MADE ONE TOO

SHOP REF CATEGORY
IF YOU GET ONE LET ME KNOW I TOO WOULD LIKE THIS
I WISH IT SAID THE ADVENTURE ENDS OVER THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES
I DON'T GET IT IT ALREADY WAS A POSTER
ANY IDEAS HOW I CAN WORK OUT WHAT ITS WORTH I WANT TO SELL IT I HAVE HAD IT SINCE IT CAME OUT IN

I HAVE TRIED SEARCHING VIA ISBN BUT NO LUCK I HAVE ALSO DUG THROUGH EBAY AND GUMTREE AUSTRALIAN EBAY THING

PLEASE HELP
I'VE READ THAT GANDALF CANNOT DIRECTLY INTERFERE WITH THE QUEST TO DESTROY THE RING AND CAN'T USE HIS FULL POWER

CLOSE BUT NOT QUITE GANDALF DOES DIRECTLY INTERFERE WITH THE QUEST TO DESTROY THE RING REMEMBER HOW HE WAS LITERALLY THE LEADER OF THE FELLOWSHIP GUIDING THEM ON THEIR PATH TO DESTROY THE RING

RULE GANDALF IS FORBIDDEN TO MATCH POWER WITH POWER THIS SEEMS TO MEAN THAT GANDALF IS NOT ALLOWED BY THOSE WHO SENT HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF THE SORCEROUS OVERLORD OF CONDOR AND RAISE ARMIES TO DO HIS BIDDING AND DESTROY THE REALM OF MORDOR THE PASSAGE COULD ALSO BE INTERPRETED THAT GANDALF WAS NOT ALLOWED TO DEVELOP HIS MAGICAL ABILITIES UNTIL THEY RIVALED THOSE OF SARON BUT THAT WAS NEVER REALLY AN OPTION TO BEGIN WITH GANDALF SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE THE RAW FIREPOWER NECESSARY TO PLAY DUMBLEDORE VS VOLDEMORT AGAINST THE LORD OF THE RING

BUT ON TOP OF THAT GANDALF AND THE OTHER WIZARDS ARE NOT FAKING THEIR BODIES THEY ARE REALLY FLESH AND BLOOD WALKING AROUND WITH SKINNED KNEES AND ARTHRITIS AND EVEN DYSENTERY SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO TRAVEL THE OREGON TRAIL A MORTAL CORPOREAL FORM SIMPLY CANNOT HARNESS OR WIELD THE FULL POWER THAT GANDALF WAS CAPABLE OF AS COLORIN IN THE WESTERN

SAURURAN BROKE RULE HE DECIDED SCREW IT I'M STEALING THE RING FOR MYSELF AND TAKING OVER THE WORLD HE WAS THE SECOND MOST BADASS MAGE SARON TAKES THE GOLD MEDAL IN THAT CATEGORY BUT THEY BOTH FLUNKED OUT OF THE RUNNING FOR MISS CONGENIALITY MIDDLE EARTH HAD SEEN SINCE THE END OF THE FIRST AGE WHEN THE ALAR THEMSELVES WENT TO WAR AGAINST MORGOTH BUT HE WAS STILL MORTAL WORM-TONGUED CUT HIS THROAT AND SAURURAN THE WISE SAURURAN OF MANY COLOURS MASTER OF ORTHANT AND SELF-PROCLAIMED RINGMAKER JUST DIED ON DOORSTEP LIKE A WHINY LITTLE BASTARD
YES GANDALF CAN AND DID USE HIS FULL POWERS SEE THE FIGHT WITH BANE RECOUNTED IN THE WHITE RIDER HE AND HIS PEERS WERE TO ACT AS GUIDES TO BRING THE PEOPLE OF MIDDLE-EARTH TOGETHER TO DEAL WITH SARON THEY WERE NOT TO LORD OVER OR COW THEM WITH THEIR POWERS AS TO THE QUEST HE LED IT UNTIL THEY REACHED THE EASTERN GATE OF MORIA SURE HE CAN DECIDE WHEN AND WHERE TO USE HIS FULL POWERS OR TO WHAT DEGREE LIKE WHEN AN ADULT PLAYS WITH A CHILD COMPARED TO AN ADULT I EAST GANDALF THE WHITE WITH THE THREE COMPANIONS

HE LIFTED UP HIS STAFF AND AXE LEAPED FROM HIS GRASP AND FELL RINGING ON THE GROUND THE SWORD OF ARAGON STIFF IN HIS MOTIONLESS HAND BLAZED WITH A SUDDEN FIRE PERGOLAS GAVE A GREAT SHOUT AND SHOT AN ARROW HIGH INTO THE AIR IT VANISHED IN A FLASH OF FLAME THE WHITE RIDER

OR GANDALF THE GREY WITH BANE

THERE WAS NONE TO SEE OR PERHAPS IN AFTER AGES SONGS WOULD STILL BE SUNG OF THE BATTLE OF THE PEAK SUDDENLY GANDALF LAUGHED BUT WHAT WOULD THEY SAY IN SONG THOSE THAT LOOKED UP FROM AFAR THOUGHT THAT THE MOUNTAIN WAS CROWNED WITH STORM THUNDER THEY HEARD AND LIGHTNING THEY SAID SMOTE UPON CELEBDIL AND LEAPT BACK BROKEN INTO TONGUES OF FIRE IS THAT NOT ENOUGH A GREAT SMOKE ROSE ABOUT US VAPOUR AND STEAM ICE FELL LIKE RAIN THE WHITE RIDER
ALL THE WIZARDS ARE SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED ON THEIR MORTAL FORMS AS OPPOSED TO SARON WHO IS NOT THAT BEING SAID THEY STILL INITIALLY HELD BACK A LOT OF WHAT POWER THEY DID HAVE BECAUSE OF THE RULES THE ALAR SET FOR THEM SAURURAN BROKE THIS GANDALF DID NOT GANDALF WAS ALLOWED TO USE ALL HIS POWER AGAINST THE BARONG BECAUSE THE BARONG WAS A DEMON OF TIMES BEFORE LOAR AND NOT RELATED TO THE EVENTS AT HAND THE DESCRIPTION WE HAVE OF THAT BATTLE IS ONE OF FIRE AND LIGHTNING IN A STORM TYPE GOD BATTLE OF EPIC PROPORTION AND I THINK THAT HINTS AT HOW POWERFUL GANDALF ACTUALLY COULD BE HAD HE BROKEN THE RULES POTENTIALLY RIVALING SARON IN A SIMILAR WAY THAT SAURURAN DID
KEEP IN MIND THE TIMES WE ACTUALLY DO SEE GANDALF UNLEASH HIS POWER OR AT LEAST PART OF IT THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE NEAR MORIA WAS ENTIRELY ONE-SIDED TOWARDS GANDALF NO DOUBT THE REST OF THE FELLOWSHIP'S WARRIORS COULD HAVE HELD THEIR OWN BUT GANDALF LITERALLY JUST FIRE THE ENEMY AND THEY TURNED TAIL

NOTE HOW FIRST HE STATED SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF GANDALF IS HERE TURN BACK BEFORE YOU GET HURT EVERY TIME WE SEE GANDALF PRE-ENGAGEMENT HE MAKES THE SAME PROCLAMATION HIS WORDS TO THE BARONG AT THE BRIDGE WERE SUCH A MESSAGE WORDED IN MORE ANCIENT MYTHOLOGICAL VOCABULARY

IT SEEMS THAT GANDALF WAS ALLOWED TO UNLEASH AT LEAST PART OF HIS POWER WHEN CONFRONTED DIRECTLY AND WITH NO REASONABLE MEANS TO FLEE WE SEE THAT OL G IS FULLY CAPABLE OF HOLDING ALL NINE NAGUAL BY HIMSELF AS HE DID AT FEATHERTOP AS WELL AS FIGHTING AN ANCIENT DEMON TO A DRAW AFTER HIS FALL IN MORIA SO WHEN NECESSARY GANDALF IS FULLY CAPABLE OF KICKING MAJOR ASS HE JUST USUALLY ACTS AS COUNSELOR ADVISOR OR AS A KIND OF RALLYING BEACON FOR THE FREE PEOPLES
WHEN

THE ORIGINAL SETTLEMENT

ATTEMPT AT A COLONY

DURING THE QUEST

AFTER THE QUEST
FIBROID BECAUSE HE WAS THE COOLEST ELF ON THE BLOCK MEN LOVED HIM
BELEE ALWAYS STANDS OUT TO ME DUDE WAS A BEAST HIS DEATH STILL ANGERS ME
ESTEEMED HARP SOLOIST RAPPER AND FIBROID FELAGUND


NOW NEWS CAME TO HITHLUM THAT DORTHONION WAS LOST AND THE SONS OF FINARFIN OVERTHROWN AND THAT THE SONS OF FËANOR WERE DRIVEN FROM THEIR LANDS THEN FINGOLFIN BEHELD AS IT SEEMED TO HIM THE UTTER RUIN OF THE NOLUDAR AND THE DEFEAT BEYOND REDRESS OF ALL THEIR HOUSES AND FILLED WITH WRATH AND DESPAIR HE MOUNTED UPON ROCHALLOR HIS GREAT HORSE AND RODE FORTH ALONE AND NONE MIGHT RESTRAIN HIM HE PASSED OVER LIKE A WIND AMID THE DUST AND ALL THAT BEHELD HIS ONSET FLED IN AMAZE THINKING THAT OROM HIMSELF WAS COME FOR A GREAT MADNESS OF RAGE WAS UPON HIM SO THAT HIS EYES SHONE LIKE THE EYES OF THE ALAR THUS HE CAME ALONE TO GATES AND HE SOUNDED HIS HORN AND SMOTE ONCE MORE UPON THE BRAZEN DOORS AND CHALLENGED MORGOTH TO COME FORTH TO SINGLE COMBAT AND MORGOTH CAME
TURGOR

HE COULD HAVE SAT WITH HIS PEOPLE AT GONDOLIER BUT HE LED THEM OUT AND TOOK PART AT THE INBREATH
HAVING NOT READ THE SIL I'M GOING WITH ELROD THE DUDE SACRIFICED A LOT FOR THE BETTER OF MIDDLE EARTH AND FOR HIS DAUGHTER ELROD WAS AS NOBLE AS THEY COME
DEFIANTLY NOT EASY TO ANSWER
IT COULD EITHER BE GLORFINDEL THE SHINY UNSULLIED HERO WHO'S INCREDIBLY MIGHTY AND ONLY DOES GOOD ACTUALLY QUITE BORING AND FLAT I KNOW I JUST LIKE THAT HE KEEPS REAPPEARING EVERY TIME I'M LIKE YAY THAT GUY AGAIN ALSO ONE OF THE FEW THAT ACTUALLY KILLED A BARONG

OR MAYBE CHURDAN FOR ALSO CONSTANTLY REAPPEARING AND GIVING REFUGEE TO EVERY ONE UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT HIM

I ALSO LIKED FINEW WHEN I FIRST READ ABOUT HIM IN THE SILMARILLION BUT THEN HE WENT ALL CRAZY L AND I KIND OF BLAME ALL TROUBLE ON HIM XD

ANOTHER WORTHY CANDIDATE IS FIBROID FELAGUND A BIT MORE TRAGIC AND ENTANGLED IN ALL THIS

EDIT AND WE ALL LIKE PERGOLAS DON'T WE
EASY BIRDMAN
EITHER BIRDMAN THE SHIPWRIGHT BECAUSE I FIND HIS HISTORY AND STORY FASCINATING OR BELEE BECAUSE OF HOW LOYAL AND BADASS HE IS

FEASOR IS A REALLY INTERESTING FORCEFUL CHARACTER BUT I'M NOT SURE I COULD SAY I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH
FIBROID CLOSE TIE FOR FINGOLFIN THOUGH


HONESTLY IT'S HARD TO PICK BETWEEN THE THREE BUT PROBABLY SNAP CRACKLE AND POP ARE COOL BUT SNAP JUST SNAPS YOU FEEL ME
I THINK I'M GOING TO GO WITH ECTHELION DUDE MANAGED TO KILL GOTHMOG LEADER OF THE BARONGS EQUAL ONLY TO SARON HE DOES THIS AND STILL DOESN'T GET THE SAME RECOGNITION AS GLORFINDEL
YEAH MAPLE EDIT FTW THEY ALSO EDITED THE FAT INTO AN INTERESTING FEATURETTE FOLLOWING MINI ADVENTURE
THERE ARE A FEW SCENES FROM THE EXTENDED EDITIONS THAT ARE IN THE BOOK THAT I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING IN AN EDIT AND AS FAR AS I KNOW THE TZOLKIN EDIT DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY EXTENDED EDITION SCENES ANYONE KNOW IF THERE IS A VERSION THAT DOES
DOES MAPLE MOSTLY CUT OUT ALFRED THAT GUY WHO WORKS FOR THE MASTER OF LAKE TOWN I LIKED THE TZOLKIN EDIT BUT THEY KEPT BASICALLY EVERY SCENE WITH HIM WHICH MAKES NO SENSE TO ME HE WAS THE JAR JAR OF THE HOBBIT
I WOULD LOVE THE MAPLE EDIT IF IT KEPT THE SIDE VENTURES OF GANDALF INTACT IN THE EDITED MOVIE

SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT THE NECESSITY TO TELL THAT STORY BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS DONE WONDERFULLY AND HELPED WITH THE PACING OF THE MOVIES
THE FIRST AMERICAN HARDCOVER EDITION HAS IT VERY COOL EDITION AS WELL
MY HARDCOVER EDITION HAS IT ISBN

I TRIED TO SUBMIT A PICTURE FOR YOU BUT IT WAS REMOVED FOR USING IMAGE HOSTING SERVICE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL

FIND IT HERE
UGH I DISLIKE MAPS THEY'RE NEAT IN THEORY BUT THEY'RE SO HARD TO USE YOU CAN'T JUST FLIP TO IT WHILE READING AND THEY TEAR SO VERY EASILY THE ONLY WAY I CAN REFERENCE A MAP WHILE READING IS WITH A BOOK PLACED FLAT ON A TABLE AND I PREFER TO DO MY READING SPRAWLED ON A COUCH
THE TED NAISMITH ILLUSTRATED EDITION HAS IT AND IT'S IN COLOR
CONTENTS MEDIA
ORC OH SHIT WAS THAT ARAGON
I NOTICED THIS AS WELL I ALWAYS JUST SAID THAT URUK WASN'T QUITE DEAD
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU USE ACTORS INSTEAD OF CGI

BTW THE GUY RIGHT TO THE LEFT OF THE CIRCLE ALSO MOVES RIGHT BEFORE ARAGON RUNS PAST HIM
HERE'S ANOTHER WHEN SAURURAN IS ON TOP OF ORTHANT AND CHANTING TOWARDS THE MOUNTAIN LOOK AT HIS LEFT HAND ONE OF THE FINGERS IS BANDAGED AND IN A CAST

AND ANOTHER ONE IN TNT WHEN ARAGON PERGOLAS AND GIMLI HAND OVER THEIR WEAPONS PERGOLAS DOES IT TWICE HE HANDS OVER HIS BOW BUT HE DOES IT AGAIN IN THE BACKGROUND WHEN ARAGON IS HANDING OVER HIS KNIFE I GUESS THE CAMERAS OVERLAPPED AND NOBODY REALIZED
OH SHIT PLAY DEAD PLAY DEAD
IS IT UNREASONABLE THAT MAYBE EVERY ORC ISN'T QUITE DEAD YET
IT WAS FRANK EATING SAUSAGES
THEY JUST FOUGHT URUK DID YOU GUYS ASSUME EVERY ONE OF THEM DIED INSTANTLY TO THE ROCKS AND SWORDS
LITERALLY UNWATCHABLE
HE PROBABLY WAS HUNGRY FOR A SNACK


WHAT'S THE PROBLEM NOT EVERYONE LAYING DOWN IS DEAD SOMETIMES THEY'RE BADLY INJURED AND ALMOST DEAD REACTED BECAUSE SOMEONE JUMPED OVER THEM
GOOD CATCH BUT I STILL LIKE THE MOVIE
HE WAS TRYING TO GET A SAUSAGE OUT OF HIS SHIRT POCKET
JESUS CHRIST STRIDER WASH YOUR BALLS ONCE IN A WHILE
ANYONE ELSE EVER NOTICE BOOT FALL OFF I THINK IN TNT IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE EXTRA MATERIAL DVDS BUT I CAN NEVER UNSEE IT NOW
IT'S AS THEY'RE RUNNING ALONG THE HILLS IN ROHAN MAYBE MAN I NEED TO THE BOOKS I JUST BOUGHT ONE OF THE ALL VERSIONS OF THE BOOK A LIFELONG DREAM AND I WILL BEGIN READING IT TODAY ON THIS LOVELY RAINY THANKSGIVING
HE HAD AXE IMBEDDED IN HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM
ARAGON IS SO LIGHT ON HIS FEET THIS ORC THOUGHT HE WAS OFF THE HOOK FOR A SECOND
ARAGON PROBABLY STOMPED HIS FINGER
NOTICED THAT THE FIRST TIME I SAW THE FILM AND ONCE SEEN IT CAN NEVER BE UNSEEN
LOL THE ACTOR PROBABLY FELL ASLEEP AND WOKE UP WHEN HE FELT ARAGON PASS BY LIKE OH SHIT WHAT WAS THAT
IT'S JUST A FLESH WOUND
RIGOR MORTIS SETTING IN
LOL IVE SEEN THAT WAS SO EPIC

WHEN YOURE WATCHING ROK WHEN ARAGON IS FIGHTING THE BATTLE TROLL LOOK AT THE GUY BEHIND HIM HES JUST SHUFFLING LEFT AND RIGHT
LIKE OKAY I GOT YOU JUST GONNA BE BEHIND YOU AHOUH AHA
I GOT ONE NONE OF YOU MENTIONED WHEN ARAGON IS LEADING THE HOBBITS OUT OF BREE AND FRODO ASKS WHERE ARE YOU TAKING US

AS ARAGON SAYS INTO THE WILD HIS BOW HITS THE CAMERA AND MOVES IT A FRACTION
THIS SCENE OVER YET
THIS IS CREEPY I LITERALLY WATCHED THIS AND NOTICE THIS SCENE ON TUESDAY NIGHT
THIS ISN'T A MISTAKE IN FACT IT WOULD BE MORE IMPLAUSIBLE IF IT WAS A BATTLEFIELD LITTERED WITH ONLY CORPSES INSTEAD OF DEAD AND WOUNDED BOTH
NO I REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT THE MOVIES ARE PERFECT
GRIMA WAS INDEED INFLUENCED BY SAURURAN AND FUNCTIONED AS TOOL INFLUENCING THEOWMEN
GREATEST POWER WAS IN HIS WORDS AND THOUGH I'M NOT SURE IT'S SAID ANYWHERE I BELIEVE HE MANIPULATED A WEAK MINDED AND CONFLICTED GRIMA AS WELL AS USING HIM TO MANIPULATE THEOWMEN
THE GAME IS AWESOME AND SUPER FUN TO PLAY QUALITY GAMEPLAY QUALITY GRAPHICS AND IS STILL A BLAST TO PLAY EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME THAT IT HAD BEEN OUT

BUT TO BE QUITE FRANK IT ABSOLUTELY BUTCHERS THE LORE
IF YOU WANT A MORE LORE COMPLIANT ACTION RPG TRY WAR IN THE NORTH FOR OR

SET DURING THE QUEST THREE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS DUNEDIN MALE RANGER HYBRID TANK RANGED ELDEN STOREMASTER HEALER DWARF TANK CROSSBOW FOR RANGE ATTACK CO-OP CAMPAIGN CAMEOS BY ELROD GANDALF ARWEN HALBARAD ARAGON GIMLI PERGOLAS FRODO ALOIN RADAGAST AND THERE IS A AREA WHERE YOU GET TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE THE SONS OF ELROD ALSO THE A GREAT EAGLE OR THREE ARE AVAILABLE TO AID AS BASICALLY A SUMMONING ATTACK IN SEVERAL OUTDOOR LEVELS AND THEY TALK AND YOU MEET GWALIOR THE LORD OF THE EAGLES

YOU GET TO FIGHT AT SOME COOL CANON PLACES FOREMOST THE BARROW DOWNS KIRKWOOD AND THE TROLLFELLS AMONGST OTHER PLACE

GRAPHICALLY ITS LAST GEN BUT ITS ALSO THE FIRST M OR GAME WITH A LOAR SETTING AS YOU GET RIDICULOUSLY COVERED IN ORC AND TROLL BLOOD AT TIMES
SORRY DUDE SOM SUCKS FROM A LORE POINT OF VIEW

AWESOME GAME THOUGH
SOLID GAMEPLAY WITH REALLY NICE GRAPHICS BUT LORE WISE IT'S BASICALLY FAN FICTION
THE LORE IS BASICALLY THEY BLEW A UNIQUE CHANCE TO BRING SOME SILMARILLION CONTENT TO THE BIGGER CROWDS BY INSTEAD CREATING THEIR OWN STORY CONTENT BEING THE FIRST GAME WHICH WAS ALLOWED TO EXPLORE THE WORLD AROUND LOAR PREVIOUSLY EITHER THE TZOLKIN SOCIETY OR MOVIE LICENSE HOLDERS WOULD LARGELY PREVENT THIS FOR A WHILE YOU GET A BIT GIDDY AT THE NEW BITS YOU READ ABOUT THE BLUE WIZARDS AND WHAT NOT HOPING THAT PERHAPS SOME WOULD BE UNPUBLISHED INFORMATION UNTIL YOU REALIZE THAT THEY MADE IT ALL UP THEMSELVES AND IF IT ISN'T BY HAND IT ISN'T REALLY PART OF LOAR

THE GAMEPLAY IS EITHER YOUR THING OR ISN'T AS OPPOSED TO SOME ADVENTURE GAMES WHERE YOUR MOVEMENT AND ATTACKS ARE FULLY FREE YOU KIND OF STICK ONTO YOUR ENEMIES HERE AUTOMATICALLY APPROACHING WHEN CLOSELY WHICH TO ME MADE IT FEEL A BIT MORE IT'S EITHER YOUR THING OR IT ISN'T THE INTELLIGENT MONSTERS SYSTEM IS OVEREXADURATED AND IS NOT THE AI THEY MADE IT SOUND TO BE BUT RATHER IS A LOT OF SCRIPTS FOR RANDOM EVENTS WHICH CAN HAPPEN IT IS HOWEVER STILL FUN

BUY IT WHEN IT'S IN DISCOUNT THAT'S MY ADVICE KEEP AN EYE ON IT AROUND CHRISTMAS THEY OFTEN DISCOUNT MANY GAMES THEN
FUN GAME BUT THE LORE IS ABSOLUTE TRIPE IT'S BASICALLY JUST SHITTY
AS A BASIC LOAR FAN I LOVED THIS GAME IT ADDS MORE LORE TO THE GAME WHETHER IF IT'S ENTIRELY CORRECT OR NOT IN GENERAL IT IS IT'S SO EPIC IN GENERAL THE GAMEPLAY IS A BONUS


OR EVEN
USER MEDIA
UNGOLIANT LOOKS TERRIFYING LOVE THIS WORK
AIR GUITAR
NO LOVE FOR GROND

WHOOPS I'M WRONG
I LOVE THAT DESIGN FOR UNGOLIANT THE ARMS ARE SO OFF-PUTTING AND ADD A DISTURBING LEVEL TO HER THAT FITS SO PERFECTLY WITH THE NECESSARY TONE

TRULY GREAT WORK I'D LOVE TO HAVE A COPY DISPLAYED
DRAWING BARONGS WITH WINGS I TOO LIKE TO LIVE DANGEROUSLY
I SAID OUT LOUD OH SHIT THAT'S BADASS TO MYSELF

ARE THERE SPECIFIC BOOKS ON THE RISE OF MORGOTH OR THE LORE OF THE DARK PARTS OF MIDDLE EARTH I'VE ONLY READ THE HOBBIT AND LOAR NOT READ THE SILMARILLION YET
ARTIST TSRODRIGUEZ ON DEVIANTART
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I LOVE POSE MORE THAN ANYTHING SOMETHING ABOUT A VERY SMALL MAN CONFIDENTLY STANDING UP AGAINST A MASSIVE MONSTER AND SAYING COME GET SOME
I'VE NEVER SEEN UNGOLIANT DEPICTED WITH HUMAN ARMS BEFORE IS THERE A SOURCE FOR THIS OR IS IT JUST SOMETHING THE ARTIST THOUGHT UP OTHERWISE THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING PIECE OF MIDDLE EARTH ARTWORK I'VE EVER SEEN I LOVE IT SO MUCH
FOAH IT LOOKS AWESOME I LIKE IT HOW IT SHOWS UNGOLIANT EVEN BIGGER THAN MORGOTH SHOWING HOW POWERFUL SHE WAS
WHAT THE SHIT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
DELETED
I KNOW THEY STILL HAVE THE HOBBIT ONES UP AT AUCKLAND INTERNATIONAL NOT SURE ABOUT WELLINGTON I THINK THEY SWAPPED IT FOR A SMUG DISPLAY
WAS IN WELLINGTON LAST MONTH AND GOLLUM ISN'T THERE SADLY BUT THERE ARE SOME COOL EAGLES INSTEAD ALSO BE SURE TO CHECK OUT SMUG AT THE AIR NZ CHECK IN AREA SMUG IS EASY TO MISS IF YOU'RE ONLY FLYING IN TO WELLINGTON AND NOT OUT
AT AUCKLAND AIRPORT THERE IS A AINT DWARVES STATUE FROM THE HOBBIT
I'M FAIRLY SURE IT STILL IS
HAVE A NICE TRIP DUDE
HARD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE OPENING MINUTES OF THE FELLOWSHIP OR THE RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM IN RETURN

SORRY TO BE THE STEREOTYPE BUT JUST WATCHING THEOWMEN LEADING HIS PEOPLE INTO WHAT HE PROBABLY THOUGHT WAS CERTAIN DEATH AND GIVING THAT FANTASTIC SPEECH IT'S GLORIOUS TO WATCH

BUT THE OPENING OF FELLOWSHIP IS THE BEST SUMMARY YOU HOPED FOR SO MUCH INFORMATION POURED INTO MINUTES WHICH HELPED YOU DIVE INTO MIDDLE-EARTH AND GET A GOOD FEEL FOR HOW THE FILMS WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EITHER ONE
DEATH SCENE
GANDALF CONFRONTING BURINS BANE BECAUSE HE'S NOT LIMITED TO HIS NORMAL RULES AND GETS TO UNLEASH HIS FULL POWERS PLUS YOU SHALL NOT PASS IS ONE OF THE MOST EPIC LINES EVER

I ALSO LOVE WHEN ARAGON CONFRONTS THE KING OF THE OATHBREAKERS AND USES ANDURIL THE WAY HE'S LAUGHING THINKING HE'LL EASILY TAKE OUT ARAGON AND THE SHOCK WHEN HE REALIZES WHO HE IS ALSO JUST THE BADASSNESS OF ARAGON IN THAT SCENE HE'S FINALLY STEPPING INTO HIS BIRTHRIGHT AND IS NOT TAKING ANCONES BS YOU WILL SUFFER ME


SAMS SPEECH FROM THE TWO TOWERS CHILLS EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT
AT THE END OF THE FELLOWSHIP WHEN ARAGON PERGOLAS AND AIMIL DECIDE TO GO AFTER MERRY AND PIPPIN ALSO THE ICONIC LINE OF LETS HUNT SOME ORC WITH THE HEROIC THEME IN THE BACKGROUND PERFECT ENDING
WHEN BOTH SAM AND FRODO ARE EXHAUSTED CLIMBING MOUNT DOOM AND SAM TELLS FRODO I CAN'T CARRY IT FOR YOU BUT I CAN CARRY YOU SO AWESOME IT ALWAYS GIVES ME CHILLS
THE SCENE RIGHT AFTER THE RING IS DESTROYED SAM AND FRODO LAYING ON THE ROCKS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHAOS TALKING IT'S SO SAD AND HAPPY AT THE SAME TIME I LOVE WHEN SAM TALKS ABOUT ROSIE CRYING AND THEN THE MUSIC AND THE EAGLES I'M NOT A MOVIE CRIER AT ALL BUT THIS SCENE ALWAYS MAKES ME TEAR UP A BIT
CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE WITH THE INTERCUT OF PIPPIN SINGING MIST AND SHADOW TO DENETHOR

ARAGON AT THE BLACK GATE MINUS THE KILLING OF THE MOUTH OF SARON WHICH IS OUT OF CHARACTER FOR HIM AND COULD BE CONSIDERED A WAR CRIME AS YOU DO NOT KILL HERALDS DURING A PARLEY ESPECIALLY FOR FRODO AND THE FACT THAT THE FIRST TO TO CHARGE WITH HIM ARE MERRY AND PIPPIN WHO QUICKLY GET OVERTAKEN BY EVERYONE ELSE


MY FRIENDS YOU BOW TO NO ONE I KNOW THAT LITERALLY ISN'T IN THE BOOKS BUT IT TEARS ME UP EVERY TIME BECAUSE I KNOW IT CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF MESSAGE THAT THE HOBBITS ARE THE TRUE HEROES OF THE STORY
EITHER PERGOLAS AND GIMLI COMPETING FOR THE MOST KILLS OR WHEN THE NAZGÛL ENTER BREE AND RAID THE WRONG SLEEPING ROOM THE FIRST IS A NICE COMIC RELIEF AND THE SECOND DRAWS A NICE PICTURE OF THE NAZGÛL AND I LIKED THAT THEY TRIED TO MAKE YOU THINK THAT THE HOBBITS ARE ALL STILL IN THERE BEDS
WHAT'S YOURS
THE LIGHTING OF THE BEACONS SUCH A COOL SCENE THE MOUNTAINS AND THEOWMEN ANSWERING THE CALL
OSGILIATH IS LOST AND CRITH DUNGOL MASSACRE
I RETURN TO YOU AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE
THE RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM IT GIVES ME CHILLS EVERY TIME


THE DELETED SCENE WHERE FRODO LIGHTS BAG END ON FIRE FOR INSURANCE MONEY
THE COUNCIL OF ELROD DELEGATES FROM EVERY CORNER OF MIDDLE EARTH COMING TOGETHER TO DISCUSS HOW THEY WILL DEAL WITH THE GREATEST CRISIS EVER FACED IN THE 3RD AGE AT LEAST


YOU HAVE MY SWORD AND YOU HAVE MY BOW AND MY AXE


AND WHEN PIPPIN SAYS AT THE END RIGHT WHERE ARE WE GOING
THIS
WATCH V URMQXIEVPN
EASY DEATH IT IS AMAZING ACTING AND IS ONE PLACE WHERE THE MOVIE IS BETTER THAN WHAT IS IN THE BOOK
CONCERNING HOBBITS THE SHIRE IS SO PRETTY AND I LIKED THE MUSIC IN THAT SCENE
DELETED SCENE WHERE ARAGON AND ARWEN PORK
I LOVED THE SCENE WITH SPEECH AT THE END OF TWO TOWERS AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE BATTLE AT HELMS DEEP AND PELENNOR FIELDS THAT'S CHEATING I KNOW

I ALSO REALLY LOVED RIDDLES IN THE DARK SCENE IN AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY AS WELL AS THAT ONE SCENE IN THE MOVIE WHERE LADY GALADRIEL ASKS GANDALF WHY THE HALFLING
SOMEONE MENTIONED THIS TO YOU IN THE OTHER THREAD BUT YOUR ASSERTION THAT THE WAY SHADOW OF MORDOR TREATED CELEBRIMBOR WAS CORRECT IN GENERAL IS HONESTLY REALLY REALLY WRONG

MOVIES IN EFFECTIVELY ERASING CELEBRIMBOR FROM EXISTENCE WERE SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE MORE CORRECT ABOUT STORY THAN SHADOW OF MORDOR

YOU PROBABLY DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CELEBRIMBOR BESIDES THAT HE WAS AN ELF AND HE MADE THE THREE RINGS NOT IF YOU'RE BASING YOUR INFORMATION OFF SHADOW OF MORDOR YOU MAY THINK YOU KNOW MORE BUT THAT'S PRECISELY THE PROBLEM IT'S RUBBISH INFORMATION
NO THANKS
I HONESTLY THINK SOM IS MEANT AS FAN FICTION IT'S AN ADDITIONAL STORY SET IN THE WORLD OF MIDDLE EARTH IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A FIXED PART OF WORK SOMETIMES LOAR FANS ARE TOO HARD ON THIS GAME
WAS IT 2D AND YOU LOOKED AT THE CHARACTERS FROM THE SIDE
I BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN A DEMO OF THE RETURN OF THE KING GAME I REMEMBER GETTING A DEMO OF THE GAME IN A BOX OF POP TARTS AROUND THAT TIME AND IT SOUNDS PRETTY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU DESCRIBED
WHERE DID SARON GET THAT PHYSICAL BODY
THAT IS AWESOME WELL DONE
THE STYLIZED FLAMES ARE AMAZING AND I LOVE HOW HIS SHADOW SEEMS TO FLOW OUT LIKE SMOKE OR FLAME ITSELF I LOVE YOUR INTERPRETATION THIS IS GREAT WORK LOVE ALL THE SMALL DETAILS YOU'VE INCLUDED
SOMETHING SOMETHING WINGS SOMETHING S

SERIOUSLY THOUGH GREAT WORK I THINK YOU NAILED IT
GOD DAMN THATS SO FUCKING METAL
NOW THAT'S FANTASY ARTWORK WELL EXECUTED GREAT WORK
AMAZING WORK DUDE I LOVE THE STYLE AND DETAIL THANKS FOR SHARING
YOU ALSO SHOULD POST IT ON R IMAGINARYMIDDLEEARTH
THIS IS BEYOND EPIC SELLING PRINTS
WOW THIS IS CRAZY GOOD DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ILLUSTRATIONS LOVE THE COLOUR
THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD PAINTING BUT I WISH PEOPLE WOULD TRY SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT THE MOVIES DID
AWESOME
INCREDIBLE AND UNIQUE WHAT SOFTWARE METHODS DID YOU USE TO CREATE THIS
HAUNTING IN SUCH A GOOD WAY EXCELLENT WORK
VERY WELL DONE
VERY NICE DID YOU HAPPEN TO INCORPORATE ANY INSPIRATION FROM DIABLO VIDEO GAME
THIS IS GREAT MANUAL FOR YOUR OWN REFERENCE IN THE FUTURE THE BARONG IN MORIA IS KNOWN AS BANE
THE ONLY DWARVES BOOK I THINK WE SEE IS THE BOOK OF MAZARBUL AND IT DOESN'T HAVE CHIPPED CORNERS
RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH IT'S THE ONLY OTHER BOOK THAT COMES TO MY MIND IT'S NOT DWARVES THOUGH
GIVE IT A LOOK ANYWAYS END OF LAST MOVIE MAYBE IT INSPIRES YOU
SHOT OF THE BOOK OF MAZARBUL AND THE RED BOOK CRAP QUALITY BUT OH WELL CAN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER BOOKS FROM LOAR IF I WAS MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE HOBBIT FILMS I'D GRAB ANY FROM THOSE FOR YA
WE GRIND WICKED ASPHALT FOR CONDOR AND WAR
SHOULD THIS TO R SKATEBOARDING
THUS REMINDS ME I NEED TO WATCH IT AGAIN
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO A BEFORE THE YEAR IS OUT

PIPPIN SINGING THE EDGE OF NIGHT ALWAYS GIVES ME CHILLS I HAVE VERY FEW COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE MOVIE EVEN AFTER THE BOOKS TWICE THIS YEAR BUT THE HOBBIT MOVIES WELL PERHAPS MY CRITICISMS ARE BEST LEFT UNSAID THOUGH THEY WERE PRETTY FUN MY BOYFRIEND HAS NEVER READ THEM AND IS CURRENTLY THEM I'M VICARIOUSLY LIVING THROUGH HIS EXPERIENCE

MY TRADITION IS TO MARATHON THEM THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING US SUSTAINED BY LEFTOVERS
I WOULD HAVE MADE THEM LONGER XD
NAH SERIOUSLY THEY ARE REALLY GOOD BUT IMAGINE THEM WITH ALL THE SCENES THAT HAD TO CHANGED CUT SHORT LEFT OUT
ANYWAYS WITH THEM IT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A MARATHON AND A PAIN TO WATCH FOR FIRST TIMERS GUESS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BECOME SO POPULAR IF THEY WERE AN EXACT COPY OF THE BOOKS
NICE MY 2 BUDDIES AND ME TURNED ON THE EXTENDED ROK THIS WEEKEND AND HUNKERED DOWN WITH SOME BEERS AND FOOD TURNS OUT I LOST DISC 2 SO WHEN IT GOT TO THE PART WHERE THE ORCS START TO BRING UP GROND THE SCREEN WENT BLACK AND PANIC MODE SET IN

STILL HAVEN'T FOUND DISC 2 AND IT WAS THE LARGEST CASE OF I'VE HAD SINCE MY JR PROM IN HIGH SCHOOL BLACK FRIDAY CAN'T COME QUICK ENOUGH BUYING THE TRILOGY AGAIN
LEAST REMOVAL OF TOM BOBADIL WHO IS LIKE BEAR GUY IN THE HOBBIT IN A WAY AND LACK OF CREEPY FOREST SIMILAR TO FORBIDDEN FOREST IN HP WITH OLD MAN WILLOW COME TO THINK OF IT HAGRID IS LIKE A GIANT DIMWITTED TOM BOBADIL THE ENTIRE ARC BETWEEN SHIRE AND BREE WAS AWESOME

BEST CREEPY GHOST CAVE BUT ITS UNSETTLING HOW MOVIE VERSION TRIED TO KILL THE GUY THEY HAD BEEN WAITING FOR SO THAT WOULD MAKE BEST THEIR FIGHT SO OP

I WANNA GET A ONE UP ON MY FRIENDS THAT THINK GAME OF THRONES IS BIGGER THAN MIDDLE EARTH

YOU CAN TELL THEM THERE IS NO COMPARISON GEORGE MARTIN ISN'T INTERESTED IN WORDBUILDING FOR THE SAKE OF IT HE'S DECENT AT THE ICEBERG EFFECT MAKING HIS WORLD SEEM VAST UNDER THE SURFACE WHEN THERE IS IN FACT VERY LITTLE THAT ISN'T SHOWN HE HAS ADMITTED TO INVENTING NEW VOCABULARY IN THE VARIOUS LANGUAGES AS HE GOES ALONG AND NEEDS THEM THERE ARE ABOUT TEN WORDS IN OLD HIGH VALERIAN AND WHEN I NEED MORE I'LL CREATE THEM MARTIN CREATED THE WORLD FOR THE STORY TZOLKIN WROTE THE STORY TO SHOWCASE THE WORLD THERE IS A LOT MORE MATERIAL ABOUT ME
NOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE TIME PERIOD FOLLOWING THE WAR OF THE RING ALMOST ALL OF THE LIMITED MATERIAL THAT WAS WRITTEN CAN BE FOUND IN THE APPENDICES ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION TZOLKIN DID BEGIN WORK ON A NOVEL SET IN THE FOURTH AGE CALLED THE NEW SHADOW HOWEVER HE ABANDONED THE WORK EARLY ON BELIEVING IT TO BE TOO DARK AND A TALE NOT WORTH TELLING

ALTHOUGH NOT MUCH WAS WRITTEN ABOUT THE WORLD DURING AND AFTER THE FOURTH AGE WE ACTUALLY KNOW QUITE A LOT ABOUT LEGENDARIUM IS INTENDED TO BE A MYTHIC PREHISTORY OF OUR WORLD AND AS SUCH ALL OF OUR KNOWN HISTORY UP TO THIS VERY DAY IS A CONTINUATION OF THE STORY

FINAL NOTE THE LEGENDARIUM IS LARGER AND DEEPER THAN A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE BUT THE WAY TO PROVE THAT IS NOT BY LOOKING INTO THE PERIOD AFTER THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE VAST MAJORITY OF TOLKIENS WRITING TAKES PLACE BEFORE THAT
THERE IS A GOOD DEAL MORE RINGS THEN THE MENTIONED IN THE POEM BEFORE THESE WERE CRAFTED THE ELDEN SMITHS WERE MAKING MANY LESSER RINGS SO IT COULD HAVE ALSO BEEN ONE OF THESE ALSO GANDALF DOES NOT LIKE TO RELY ON THINGS NOT SURE SO HE GOES AND CHECKS IN MINAS AIRTH AND AFTERWARDS DOES THE FINAL TEST BY THROWING IT IN THE FIRE
I GUESS FOR THE FIRST WHILE HE MUST HAVE ASSUMED THAT RING IS ONE OF THE LESSER ONCE
I THINK HE HAD A SUSPICION BUT WASN'T SURE AND HE KNEW THE RING WOULD BE SAFE IN THE HANDS OF BILBO WETHER IT WAS THE ONE RING OR NOT
CIRC THE MAJOR RINGS THE ONES IN THE POEM ALL HAD GEMS MINOR RINGS AS WELL AS THE ONE RING WERE UNADORNED GANDALF ASSUMES RING IS A MINOR RING
JUST A LITTLE COMMENT ON THE RINGS FOR MEN THEY ARE WITH SARON HE USES THE RINGS TO CONTROL THE NAGUAL
JUST READ THROUGH A LOT OF THE COMMENTS AND I'M AGREEING WITH A LOT OF IT ONE THING I WANTED TO ADD TOO IS THAT SAURURAN HAD ALSO WORKED VERY HARD TO CONVINCE THE WHITE COUNCIL THAT THE ONE HAD FALLEN INTO THE ALNUIN AND WASHED OUT TO SEA GANDALF WAS SUSPICIOUS OF RING BUT A MAN HE TRUSTED THAT HE VIEWED AS GREATER AND WISER THAN HIMSELF TOLD HIM THE ONE WAS LOST LONG AGO NEVER TO BE FOUND AGAIN SO GANDALF WAS WORRIED ABOUT RING BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS UNTIL AROUND BIRTHDAY OR A LITTLE BEFORE THAT HE BEGAN TO GET REALLY WORRIED
THERE ARE OTHER RINGS BESIDES THE ONES SARON CORRUPTED THEY JUST AREN'T NEARLY AS POWERFUL AS THOSE RINGS
THE NINE THE SEVEN AND THE THREE HE SAID HAD EACH THEIR PROPER GEM NOT SO THE ONE IT WAS ROUND AND UNADORNED AS IT WERE ONE OF THE LESSER RINGS BUT ITS MAKER SET MARKS UPON IT THAT THE SKILLED MAYBE COULD STILL SEE AND READ


I'VE ALWAYS READ THIS AS MEANING THE FOLLOWING

THERE'S THE ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL
THERE'S THE THREE ELDEN RINGS ANARYA KENYA AND ILYA
THERE'S THE SEVEN DWARVES RINGS
THERE'S THE NINE RINGS OF MEN
THERE'S SEVERAL LESSER MAGICAL RINGS

THEIR POWER PROBABLY MORE NUANCED WHEN COMPARED TO THE OTHERS BUT NO LESS DANGEROUS IF HANDLED CARELESSLY
MAYHAPS GIFTED TO CHAMPIONS AND INDIVIDUALS OF UNIQUE CHARACTER PERHAPS SIMPLY GATHERING DUST IN PLACES UNTOUCHED AND LONG FORGOTTEN



GANDALF PROBABLY ASSUMED BILBO TO OWN ONE SUCH LESSER RING DANGEROUS IN THE HANDS OF A POWERMONGER YET ONLY A TRINKET IN THE HANDS OF A HAPPY-GO-LUCKY HOBBIT WARRANTING SUSPICION BUT CERTAINLY NO PRECAUTION THE ONE RING WAS THOUGHT LOST A MAGICAL RING COULD HAVE MADE ITS WAY INTO HANDS
THIS IS EXPLAINED BY GANDALF IN THE SHADOW OF THE PAST
GANDALF ALWAYS SUSPECTED BILBO HAD A RING IT WAS ONLY WHEN BILBO USED IT TO DISAPPEAR THAT HE SUSPECTED IT WAS THE ONE RING AFTER RESEARCH HE DISCOVERED A WAY TO PROVE IT AND THAT WAS TO THROW IT INTO THE FIRE TO SEE IF THE POEM APPEARED ENGRAVED IN THE RING
ALSO THE HOBBIT CAME OUT LONG BEFORE THE TRILOGY DID AND INITIALLY TE RING WAS JUST A MAGIC RING THAT'S ALL SO WHEN TZOLKIN REWROTE IT A BIT TO EXPAND ON IT BEING THE ONE RING INSTEAD OF SIMPLY A MAGIC RING HE KIND OF LEFT SOME F THE OLDER PLOT AND STUFF IN KIND OF A SMALL OVERSIGHT AND TZOLKIN HIMSELF ANSWERS TE QUESTION IN FELLOWSHIP WHEN IT'S EXPLAINED THAT BILBO HAD LIED ABOUT HE HE GOT THE RING AND IT IN GENERAL
I HAVEN'T READ THE BOOKS FOR AWHILE SO I DON'T REMEMBER THE DETAILS FROM THAT WELL BUT IN THE HOBBIT MOVIES GANDALF SUSPECTED IT WAS THE RING FATHER HAD SINCE IT WAS THE ONLY ONE OTHER THAN THE ONE RING THAT WASN'T ACCOUNTED FOR

BUT IN A DELETED SCENE GANDALF MET FATHER AND LEARNS THAT HE HAD LOST HIS RING TO SARON SO GANDALF KNEW THAT THE ONE RING WAS THE ONLY ONE LEFT SO THERE WAS NO REASON HE SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN PETER JACKSON MAKING CONTINUITY ERRORS IN THE HOBBIT FILMS WHAT A SURPRISE
THERE ARE MORE THAN JUST THE RINGS CELEBRIMBOR AND SARON MADE AND CELEBRIMBOR EVEN MADE RINGS HE DIDN'T TELL SARON ABOUT ONE OF WHICH GANDALF HAS
THE ONE RING ICE CREAM IT KINDA RHYMES BUT I DON'T GET IT
FIRST SARON DIDN'T DIE WHEN THE RING WAS CUT FROM HIS FINGER HE WAS ACTUALLY NEARLY KILLED IN THE BATTLE BY ELENDIL AND GILGALAD AND ISILDUR THEN CUT THE RING FROM NEARLY LIFELESS BODY

NOW WHEN SARON MADE THE RING HE POURED HIS LIFE FORCE INTO IT SO WHEN IT WAS DESTROYED HE WAS VIRTUALLY DESTROYED AS WELL I SAY VIRTUALLY BECAUSE SARON IS A MAAR LIKE AN ANGEL AND CANNOT ACTUALLY DIE


FIRST QUESTION

SO HE DIED BECAUSE THE RING WAS CUT OFF OF HIM RIGHT

HE DIED BY THE HANDS OF HIS TWO OPPONENTS ELENDIL AND

AND ELENDIL ARE SLAIN IN THE ACT OF SLAYING SARON THE LETTERS OF J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN LETTER

IN THE COUNCIL OF ELROD ELROD SAYS

I BEHELD THE LAST COMBAT ON THE SLOPES OF ORODRUIN WHERE DIED AND ELENDIL FELL AND GARSIL BROKE BENEATH HIM BUT SARON HIMSELF WAS OVERTHROWN AND ISILDUR CUT THE RING FROM HIS HAND WITH THE OF HIS FATHER'S SWORD AND TOOK IT FOR HIS OWN

THE SAME IS EXPRESSED IN THE FOLLOWING PIECE OF TEXT

AT THE LAST THE SIEGE WAS SO STRAIT THAT SARON HIMSELF CAME FORTH AND HE WRESTLED WITH AND ELENDIL AND THEY BOTH WERE SLAIN AND THE SWORD OF ELENDIL BROKE UNDER HIM AS HE FELL BUT SARON ALSO WAS THROWN DOWN AND WITH THE OF GARSIL ISILDUR CUT THE RULING RING FROM THE HAND OF SARON AND TOOK IT FOR HIS OWN OF THE RINGS OF POWER AND THE THIRD AGE

I WOULD SAY SARON DIED FROM HIS INJURIES ISILDUR HAD CUT THE RING FROM CORPSE

SECOND QUESTION

DOES THAT MEAN THE RING WAS KEEPING HIM ALIVE

THE RING ALLOWED HIM TO REBUILD HIMSELF IT HELD A GREAT PART OF HIS POWER AS LONG AS IT WAS INTACT HE WAS GOOD EVEN WHEN THE RING WAS DESTROYED HE WAS NOT COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED

HE LET A GREAT PART OF HIS OWN FORMER POWER PASS INTO IT SO THAT HE COULD RULE ALL THE OTHERS THE SHADOW OF THE PAST

HIS BODY WAS ACTUALLY DESTROYED BY ELENDIL HE WAS ABLE TO REBUILD HIMSELF BECAUSE HIS POWER WAS STILL ACTIVE IN THE RING AFTER THE RING WAS DESTROYED AND HIS NEW PHYSICAL BODY DESTROYED IN THE DESTRUCTION OF HE COULD NOT REBUILD HIMSELF AGAIN BEING SO DIMINISHED

THIRD QUESTION

SO IF HE TOOK IT OFF WOULD HE DIE

NO HE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE IN LETTER TZOLKIN SAID EVEN IF HE DID NOT WEAR IT THAT POWER EXISTED IN WAS IN RAPPORT WITH HIMSELF HE WAS NOT DIMINISHED THE LETTERS OF J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN HE HAS A PHYSICAL BODY THROUGHOUT LOAR AND LONG BEFORE THE EVENTS WE PARTAKE OF IN THE BOOKS SO HE IS CLEARLY WALKING AROUND WITHOUT THE ONE ALTHOUGH HE HAD GATHERED MANY OF THE OTHER RINGS OF POWER SAVE THE THREE HELD BY THE ELVES AND GANDALF AND FOUR OF THE SEVEN THREE OF THE SEVEN SURVIVED THE OTHER FOUR WERE CONSUMED BY DRAGON FIRES

FOURTH QUESTION

HE DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE RING HOW DID HE LIVE THEN

THE RING WAS A TOOL USED BY SARON TO DOMINATE THE WILLS OF THE ELVES SARON IS A MAIA WHO'RE THE SERVANTS OF THE ALAR HE WAS A MAIA OF THE VALA AUL BEFORE HE TURNED TO MELIOR THE ALAR AND MAAR ARE AINU WHO WERE AROUND BEFORE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD ARDA
WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ACTUAL ELF EARS YOU COULD TRY AMAZON JUST MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT THE REVIEWS IF YOU WANT A CHEAP WAY JUST TAPE THE EDGES OF YOUR EARS TOGETHER SO IT'S POINTED I USED SCOTCH TAPE AND IT WORKED SURPRISINGLY WELL YOU CAN'T SEE IT AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES YOU DON'T REALLY NOTICE IT
HIS DEVOTION TO HIS FATHERS WORK IS OUTSTANDING THE TZOLKIN FANS OF THE WORLD REALLY OWE HIM A DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR ALL THE WORK HE HAS DONE AND CONTINUES TO DO FOR THE LEGACY OF MIDDLE EARTH CAN'T WAIT FOR BEDEN AND LUTHIER NEXT YEAR
ONLY YEARS TILL HIS ONEHUNDREDANDELEVENTH BIRTHDAY
HIS WORK PRESERVING ORGANIZING CONTEXTUALIZING AND INTERPRETING HIS FATHER'S WORK IS FRANKLY ONE OF THE GREATEST WORKS OF LITERARY SCHOLARSHIP EVER ATTEMPTED
WITHOUT HIM MIDDLE-EARTH WOULDN'T BE NEARLY THE SAME HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHRISTOPHER
TIL I SHARE A BIRTHDAY WITH A TZOLKIN SWEET
THANK YOU CHRISTOPHER AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY

NOT THAT HE'LL EVER READ THIS BUT STILL HE CHANGED A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES FOR THE BETTER
I REMEMBER A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO DEBATING WITH MYSELF WHETHER I SHOULD READ THE SILMARILLION AS IT WAS WAS EDITED BY CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN AND THEREFORE NOT TRULY CANNON IN MY EYES WHAT A FOOLISH THOUGHT THAT WAS THE SILMARILLION WAS ITSELF ONE OF THE BOOKS I HAVE MOST ENJOYED AND I THANK CHRISTOPHER AND J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN BOTH FOR LETTING EVERYONE SEE THE DEPTH OF MIDDLE-EARTH
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY A YEAR OLD CAN LOOK THAT YOUNG CHECK HIS FRONT POCKET
I I THE GODFATHER OF MIDDLE-EARTH
AS SOMEONE FROM R ALL I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS STILL ALIVE THAT'S PRETTY COOL
SO I BORN ON THE SAME DAY WITH MR CHRISTOPHER HE IS JUST PRETTY MUCH OLDER THAN ME
I HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN HE HAS DEDICATED THE LAST YEARS TO ARRANGING PUBLISHING AND EXPLAINING HIS FATHER'S VAST COLLECTION OF UNPUBLISHED WORKS

IT SEEMS TO ME A THANKLESS TASK IN MANY WAYS I OFTEN COME ACROSS REDDIN AND FORUM POSTS CRITICIZING HIM MISUNDERSTANDING MANY OF THE RECENT PUBLICATIONS AS MONEY GRABBING THEY COULDN'T BE MORE WRONG

IF HE WANTED HE COULD HAVE LICENSED THE LEGENDARIUM INVITED AUTHORS TO WRITE NEW MIDDLE EARTH ADVENTURES GIVEN HIS BLESSING TO NEW MOVIES ABOUT MORGOTH FEASOR TURIN ETC

THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TRAVESTY INSTEAD HE HAS ONLY EVER TRIED TO PROTECT AND ENHANCE HIS FATHER'S LITERARY LEGACY

DESPITE THE FACT THAT SO MUCH WAS LEFT UNFINISHED OR IN DISHARMONY HE HAS FOUND WAYS TO PUBLISH HIS FATHER'S WRITING WITHOUT ADDING TO IT THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH ALONE A VOLUME SET IS MIND BOGGLING STAGGERING WORK OF SCHOLARSHIP

HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHRISTOPHER
JUST FOR CLARIFICATION

RELEASED LOAR AND OTHER WORKS AND ANYTHING CHRISTOPHER RELEASES IS CANON

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER CHRISTOPHER DIES CAN HIS SON RELEASE CANON WORK
TIL I SHARE A BIRTHDAY WITH CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN
WHY DID I THINK HE WAS DEAD

WILL BE FOREVER GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR EDITING AND RELEASING THE SILMARILLION AS WE KNOW IT
SOMEONE ASK HIM WHERE HE BOUGHT THAT TIE
BILBO BAGGIES LIVES
STILL SAYS HE'S ON WIKIPEDIA
ANYONE WANT TO FIX
THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEVOTION TO THE PRESERVATION OF SO MUCH GREAT WRITING MR TZOLKIN I AM INDEBTED TO TO YOURSELF YOUR FATHER FOR CREATING ONE OF THE GREATEST WORLDS I HAVE EVER KNOWN YOUR METAPHORS YOUR HISTORY YOUR PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN ME OTHER SIDES OF LIFE IN OUR OWN WORLD CAPTIVATED ME TIME TIME AGAIN THANK YOU SIR

SO LONG THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH
LAWRENCE ALABLASTER
WOW I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS ALREADY SO OLD WOW HAPPY BIRTHDAY
WOW HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE HIS FATHER
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BUT FFS RELEASE THE SIMILARION BUTCHERED THE SPELLING RIGHTS SO WE SEE ANOTHER FILM
GLAD HE LOVES HIS FATHER'S WORK JUST WISH HE WASN'T SUCH A CUNT ABOUT COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT MIGHT NOT BE HIM COMPLETELY BUT IT IS HIS ESTATE'S DOING
AND I JUST STARTED PLAYING SHADOW OF MORDOR
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SIR
DISOWNING HIS SON WAS A REAL DOUCHE MOVE THOUGH
EXCEPT IT DOES SHOW SIGNS OF WEAR
WAS THE TEXT ORIGINALLY VISIBLE
WHAT
REFL WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
I PICKED THEM UP YEARS AGO SADLY WITHOUT A CA HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY INFO OR PHOTOS AND SORRY IF THIS IS THE WRONG PLACE I DON'T HAVE MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THESE FIGURES AND HOW IF THEY WERE SIGNED IT WAS AN IMPULSE EBAY BUY ABOUT YEARS AGO I THINK ANY WAY TO CONFIRM THESE ARE REAL SIGNATURES
YOU SHOULD GIVE IT TO ME
I HAVE THESE TOO SO IT CAN'T BE WORTH MUCH

GO BUY MEDIEVAL 2 TOTAL WAR ON AMAZON AND GET THE THIRD AGE TOTAL WAR MOD COMPLETE WITH MOS OR DIVIDE AND CONQUER I PREFER MOS YOU WILL NEVER NEED ANOTHER LOAR GAME AGAIN OR PROBABLY ANY GAME EVER FOR THAT MATTER
TRY SIL IF YOU LIKE RAGS ROGUELIKES
I'VE BEEN PLAYING LORD OF THE RINGS ONLINE OFF AND ON SINCE IT CAME OUT EASILY ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES TONS OF FUN SO I SAY GIVE THAT A TRY AND SEE IF YA LIKE IT
YES
IT'S NOT ALL THAT WEIRD A FAIR MAIDEN BEING WOOED BY A HEROIC MYSTERIOUS TO HER FIGURE THAT HAS SAVED BOTH HER SICK UNCLE AND THE ENTIRE KINGDOM IN TIME OF MOST DIRE NEED PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHT OUT OF THE FANTASY RULE BOOK IN TERMS OF ROMANCE

REALISTICALLY THE ARWEN ARAGON RELATIONSHIP IS THE WEIRDER OF THE TWO BUT TO ME AT LEAST IT IS ALSO THE MORE TOUCHING ONE
SHE LIKED HIM BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WAS WEIRD TZOLKIN WROTE ABOUT HER LOVE FOR ARAGON ELSEWHERE

IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOVE MORE THAN ONE PERSON OF THE OTHER SEX AT THE SAME TIME BUT IN A DIFFERENT MODE AND INTENSITY I DO NOT THINK THAT FEELINGS FOR ARAGON REALLY CHANGED MUCH AND WHEN HE WAS REVEALED AS SO LOFTY A FIGURE IN DESCENT AND OFFICE SHE WAS ABLE TO GO ON LOVING AND ADMIRING HIM HE WAS OLD AND THAT IS NOT ONLY A PHYSICAL QUALITY WHEN NOT ACCOMPANIED BY ANY PHYSICAL DECAY AGE CAN BE ALARMING OR AWE-INSPIRING THE LETTERS OF J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN LETTER

WHEN SHE FIRST ENCOUNTERED ARAGON SHE NOW WAS SUDDENLY AWARE OF HIM TALL HEIR OF KINGS WISE WITH MANY WINTERS GREYCLOAKED HIDING A POWER THAT YET SHE FELT FOR A MOMENT STILL AS STONE SHE STOOD THEN TURNING SWIFTLY SHE WAS GONE THE KING OF THE GOLDEN HALL THE FEELINGS SHE FELT HER WINTER WERE ON DISPLAY IN THE PASSING OF THE GREY COMPANY AND IN THE MUSTER OF ROHAN SHE HAD DESIRED TO BE A QUEEN

WHEN SHE DID NOT ANSWER HER BROTHER'S CALL TO GO TO CORMALLEN FARAMIR SPOKE TO HER

YOU DO NOT GO BECAUSE ONLY YOUR BROTHER CALLED FOR YOU AND TO LOOK ON THE LORD ARAGON HEIR IN HIS TRIUMPH WOULD NOW BRING YOU NO JOY OR BECAUSE I DO NOT GO AND YOU DESIRE STILL TO BE NEAR ME AND MAYBE FOR BOTH THESE REASONS AND YOU YOURSELF CANNOT CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM COLWYN DO YOU NOT LOVE ME OR WILL YOU NOT

I WISHED TO BE LOVED BY ANOTHER SHE ANSWERED BUT I DESIRE NO MAN'S PITY

THAT I KNOW HE SAID YOU DESIRED TO HAVE THE LOVE OF THE LORD ARAGON BECAUSE HE WAS HIGH AND PUISSANT AND YOU WISHED TO HAVE RENOWN AND GLORY AND TO BE LIFTED FAR ABOVE THE MEAN THINGS THAT CRAWL ON THE EARTH AND AS A GREAT CAPTAIN MAY TO A YOUNG SOLDIER HE SEEMED TO YOU ADMIRABLE FOR SO HE IS A LORD AMONG MEN THE GREATEST THAT NOW IS BUT WHEN HE GAVE YOU ONLY UNDERSTANDING AND PITY THEN YOU DESIRED TO HAVE NOTHING UNLESS A BRAVE DEATH IN BATTLE LOOK AT ME COLWYN THE STEWARD AND THE KING

THIS HAD BEEN CONFIRMED PREVIOUSLY IN REMARKS TO BROTHER COMER IN THE HOUSES OF HEALING

I SAW ALSO WHAT YOU SAW COMER FEW OTHER GRIEFS AMID THE ILL CHANCES OF THIS WORLD HAVE MORE BITTERNESS AND SHAME FOR A MAN'S HEART THAN TO BEHOLD THE LOVE OF A LADY SO FAIR AND BRAVE THAT CANNOT BE RETURNED SORROW AND PITY HAVE FOLLOWED ME EVER SINCE I LEFT HER DESPERATE IN DUNHARROW AND RODE TO THE PATHS OF THE DEAD AND NO FEAR UPON THAT WAY WAS SO PRESENT AS THE FEAR FOR WHAT MIGHT BEFALL HERALDRY AND YET COMER I SAY TO YOU THAT SHE LOVES YOU MORE TRULY THAN ME FOR YOU SHE LOVES AND KNOWS BUT IN ME SHE LOVES ONLY A SHADOW AND A THOUGHT A HOPE OF GLORY AND GREAT DEEDS AND LANDS FAR FROM THE FIELDS OF ROHAN THE HOUSES OF HEALING

WHEN COLWYN INITIALLY ENCOUNTER FARAMIR IN THE HOUSES OF HEALING SHE SAW THAT HERE WAS ONE WHOM NO RIDER OF THE MARK COULD OUTMATCH IN BATTLE THE STEWARD AND THE KING SORT OF LIKE ARAGON FARAMIR IS THE ONE WHO PIPPIN THOUGHT WAS A SLIGHTLY LESSER VERSION OF ARAGON

HERE WAS ONE WITH AN AIR OF HIGH NOBILITY SUCH AS ARAGON AT TIMES REVEALED LESS HIGH PERHAPS YET ALSO LESS INCALCULABLE AND REMOTE ONE OF THE KINGS OF MEN BORN INTO A LATER TIME BUT TOUCHED WITH THE WISDOM AND SADNESS OF THE ELDER RACE THE SIEGE OF CONDOR

SHE WAS INTO BOTH THE KING AND HIS STEWARD
CRAZY OBSESSED UNTIL SHE FELL FOR FARAMIR WHILE IN HOSPITAL
IN FACT PER THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH SERIES SHE AND ARAGON WERE GOING TO END UP TOGETHER TILL RATHER LATE IN THE WRITING PROCESS
THE ORIGINAL ARTIST IS BIKOL KING

HERE'S HER BLOG



I JUST TOOK CREATIVE LICENSE AND CODDED IT A BIT
SAYS THE IRON MAIDEN
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT HE EVER WAS MAGICALLY INFLUENCED WORM-TONGUED TALKED HIM INTO THINKING HE WAS WEAK AND OLD AND HE IS PRETTY OLD AND THAT EVERYTHING IS HOPELESS AND IT ALMOST IS

GANDALF JUST SHOWS HIM MAYBE WITH A LITTLE NUDGE FROM KENYA THAT THINGS AREN'T COMPLETELY SCREWED YET AND HE ISN'T COMPLETELY INFIRM
THAT NEVER HAPPENS IN THE BOOKS IT'S JUST P MOVIE NONSENSE I DOUBT THERE IS ANY SORT OF REAL EXPLANATION FOR HOW IT WAS DONE SINCE IT'S ONLY A MOVIE THING
IF YOU'RE GONNA READ THE BOOKS YOU SHOULD DO THE NORMAL ORDER OF HOBBIT LOAR INCLUDING APPENDICES IF YOU STILL WANT MORE SILMARILLION

THE SILMARILLION IS NOT A NOVEL BUT IT CONTAINS A CREATION STORY HISTORY OF THE WORLD THAT FLESHES OUT THE OTHER BOOKS A LOT ALSO YOU GET TO SEE SARON RAP BATTLE WITH AN ELF LORD

KEEP IN MIND WRITING ISN'T FOR EVERYONE THE BEGINNING OF LOAR CAN BE KINDA DULL ON FIRST READING AND THE SIL IS A VERY DRY ARCHAIC STYLE

WATCH THE LOAR MOVIES WHENEVER YOU WANT ID RECOMMEND AFTER THE BOOKS BUT I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU FOR GOING THE OTHER WAY ROUND
READ THE HOBBIT FIRST THEN LOAR
HONESTLY READ IT ALL IMO READ IT BEFORE YOU WATCH THE LOAR WITH THE HOBBIT BOOKS THEN LOAR AND THEN THE SILMARILLION SIL IS A MORE IN DEPTH READ KINDA LIKE A HISTORY OR RELIGIOUS TEXT AND IS MORE DIFFICULT IT IS SUGGESTED TO READ THROUGH IT LAST BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED A MORE DIFFICULT READ AND MAY TURN YOU AWAY

ABSI WELCOME TO THE WORLD TZOLKIN BUILT I HOPE YOU LOVE IT AS MUCH AS I DO
BE PREPARED FOR SOME MASSIVE CHANGES BETWEEN THE HOBBIT AND THE MOVIES MANY OF US REALLY DISLIKE THE HOBBIT MOVIES

THE HOBBIT IS BY FAR THE EASIEST OF THE BOOK TO GET THROUGH THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY HAS SOME LONG DRAWN OUT SECTIONS THAT QUITE HONESTLY CAN GET A BIT BORING BUT THE STORY IS AMAZING THE BOOKS TAKE SOME DEPARTURES FROM THE MOVIES AS WELL BUT I FIND THEM VERY ENJOYABLE

THE OTHER MATERIAL IS GREAT TO READ BUT READS LIKE A TEXT BOOK PURELY OPTIONAL TO THE REGULAR BOOKS BUT FELL IN A LOT OF QUESTIONS
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND READING SILMARILLION FIRST IT WILL TURN YOU OFF TO THE BOOKS WHICH WOULD BE A SHAME BECAUSE IT IS A TOUGH READ WITH LOT'S OF NAMES AND A LONG HISTORY THAT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AT FIRST READ OR EVEN SECOND OR THIRD I HAD IT FOR YEARS BEFORE I FINALLY APPRECIATED HOW GREAT IT IS READ IN THIS ORDER THE HOBBIT REMEMBER IT IS SORT OF A CHILDREN'S BOOK BUT AN ESSENTIAL PROLOGUE TO LOAR THEN READ THE LOAR TRILOGY INCLUDING THE PROLOGUE AND CONCERNING HOBBITS TAKE YOUR TIME AND ENJOY THEM NO RUSH THEN READ THE APPENDICES IN THE RETURN OF THE KING TO FULLY REALIZE THE RICHNESS AND DEPTH OF THIS INCREDIBLE WORK OF FICTION LANGUAGES ALPHABETS LINEAGES ALL THERE IF YOU ARE THEN HOPEFULLY TOTALLY HOOKED READ THE SILMARILLION TO FILL IN THE INCREDIBLY RICH HISTORY OF MIDDLE THE CREATION TO THE TIME WHEN ELVES LEAVE MIDDLE EARTH FOR LOAR TELLS ONLY A PART OF TRUST ME THAT YOU MAY NEED TO THE SILMARILLION TO FULLY UNDERSTAND IT BUT IT IS SO WORTH IT AS IT WILL ENHANCE THE RICHNESS OF THE LOAR THERE IS NO OTHER WORK OF FICTION THAT CREATES SO COMPLETE A HISTORY AND WORLD

TRY TO FORGET THE MOVIES SORT OF THE HOBBIT MEETS PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN NOT MADE FOR THE TRUE FAN BUT FOR THE ADVENTURE MOVIE MASSES A DISAPPOINTMENT AT LEAST TO ME HARRY POTTER MOVIES DID A MUCH MUCH BETTER JOB AT KEEPING TRUE TO THE FEELING AND STORY LINES OF THE BOOKS
FOR READING I RECOMMEND READING THE HOBBIT FIRST THEN THE LOAR AFTER THAT YOU HAVE A FEW OPTIONS WITH THE SILMARILLION CHILDREN OF AURIN UNFINISHED TALES ETC THE SILMARILLION I HEAR IS MUCH HARDER THAN THE HOBBIT AND LOAR I AM ABOUT TO START READING IT NOW SO I CAN'T FULLY TELL YOU HOW IT IS BUT DEFINITELY START OFF WITH THE HOBBIT LOAR FIRST THEN IF YOU REALLY LOVE IT GO TO THE SILMARILLION
READ ALL OF IT

THE SILMARILLION THE HOBBIT ALL LOAR BOOKS ALL OF IT

IF YOU'RE UP FOR THE CHALLENGE READ THE SILMARILLION FIRST IT WILL SET UP THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE FOR YOU AND I THINK YOU'LL HAVE A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMELINES AND WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN GENERAL ONCE YOU GET TO THE HOBBIT AND LOAR

I WILL WARN YOU THOUGH THAT IT IS NOT AN EASY READ AT ALL
IF YOU READ THE HOBBIT YOU WILL HATE THE TRILOGY
LETTERS

SARON SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS VERY TERRIBLE THE FORM THAT HE TOOK WAS THAT OF A MAN OF MORE THAN HUMAN STATURE BUT NOT GIGANTIC


AND HE ONLY HAS FOUR FINGERS ON ONE HAND WHERE ISILDUR CHOPPED IT

HE HAS ONLY FOUR ON THE BLACK HAND BUT THEY ARE ENOUGH



IN HIS ACTUAL PRESENCE NONE BUT VERY FEW OF EQUAL STATURE COULD HAVE HOPED TO WITHHOLD IT FROM HIM OF MORTALS NO ONE NOT EVEN ARAGON IN THE CONTEST WITH THE PALANTÍR ARAGON WAS THE RIGHTFUL OWNER ALSO THE CONTEST TOOK PLACE AT A DISTANCE AND IN A TALE WHICH ALLOWS THE INCARNATION OF GREAT SPIRITS IN A PHYSICAL AND DESTRUCTIBLE FORM THEIR POWER MUST BE FAR GREATER WHEN ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY PRESENT SARON SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS VERY TERRIBLE THE FORM THAT HE TOOK WAS THAT OF A MAN OF MORE THAN HUMAN STATURE BUT NOT GIGANTIC IN HIS EARLIER INCARNATION HE WAS ABLE TO VEIL HIS POWER AS GANDALF DID AND COULD APPEAR AS A COMMANDING FIGURE OF GREAT STRENGTH OF BODY AND SUPREMELY ROYAL DEMEANOUR AND COUNTENANCE



WAS SARON IN HIS PHYSICAL FORM AS IN A HUMANOID WITHIN BARAD DUR JUST PLANNING THE WAR AND RULING MORDOR


YES BUT HE NO LONGER HAD A FAIR ATTRACTIVE FORM INTERPRET THAT AS YOU WILLIAM
WAS THE EYE ON TOP OF BARAD DUR LITERALLY HIS PHYSICAL FORM UNTIL HE RETOOK THE RING


THAT'S JUST HOW IT WAS PORTRAYED IN THE MOVIES THE EYE WAS SOME SORT OF DEVICE OR WINDOW IN HIS TOWER AS PORTRAYED BY ARTISTS LIKE IN TED NAGUAL
THE FIERY EYE IS HIS CORRUPTED USE OF A PALANTÍR AND THEN ITS ONLY OCCASIONALLY MENTIONED HE HAS A PHYSICAL HUMANOID FORM WITH A MISSING FINGER GOLLUM TELLS FRODO THAT WHEN HE WAS TORTURED THE BLACK HAND HAS ONLY FOUR FINGERS
I TOO LIKE DEEP BETTER
HELMS DEEP JUST WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL IN MY OPINION THE CONDOR BATTLES WERE GREAT BUT I STILL CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBERS BUT LIKE MEN VS URUK AHI WAS CRAZY I ALSO JUST LIKED THE STRONGHOLD OF HELMS DEEP A BIT BETTER TWO TOWERS WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST LOAR MOVIE I SAW SO I THINK IT WILL ALWAYS HOLD A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART I'M DREADING KIND OF EXCITED FOR WHEN THE REMAKES HAPPEN
IN THE MOVIE DEFINITELY HELMS DEEP BUT IN THE BOOK I GOTTA GO WITH PELENNOR FIELDS
I LIKE THE ROHAN CHARGE BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS BETTER IN DEEP
HELMS DEEP WAS AMAZING THE BATTLE AT CONDOR WAS AMAZING BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BATTLE IN TWO TOWERS BLEW ME AWAY
I TOO LIKE DEEP BETTER
MARRY HER AND NEVER LET GO
WOW THOSE ARE COOL

CAN WE GET SOME PICS OF THE INSIDE ANY ILLUSTRATIONS
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE GOT IT
I GOTTA GET A BOYFRIEND SIGNIFICANT OTHER LIKE THIS I AM MORE JEALOUS THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE
DID SHE BUY THEM WITH LEATHER BOUND POUNDS
I WAS NOT AWARE VETERAN'S DAY GIFTS WERE A THING
GOOGLE THE ISBN NUMBER AND SEE WHAT COMES UP AT THE VERY LEAST YOU SHOULD BE ABLE FIND IT BY SEARCHING BY PUBLISHER
DP REF IE DTF QID SR KEYWORDS HERE IS THE AMAZON LINK
NICE IRON RANGERS
I BOUGHT THE THREE BOOKS SEPARATELY AT BARNES AND NOBLE
OFF TOPIC ARE THOSE RED WING IRS
I BOUGHT THIS EDITION OF FELLOWSHIP TOO BECAUSE I LIKED THE COVER ARTICLE I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM EITHER BUT THE ILLUSTRATOR IS JOHN JUDE PALENCIA JUST FOUND OUT HE DID THE ARAGON COVERS TOO ON HIS WEBSITE I FOUND THE COVERS FOR TWO TOWERS AND RETURN OF THE KING




SORRY FOR FORMATTING I'M ON MY PHONE
I HAVE THESE REALLY GOOD EDITIONS
HAVE YOU TRIED TROLLING PBS
BOOK
SEARCH BOOKS ISBN AWORK


ISN'T THE RINGWRAITH MEANT TO BE RIDING A CORSIE
CUFFING JEANS
I SPOTTED THIS WHILE ON A ROAD TRIP OVER THE PAST WEEKEND THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR ON THE BACK SAYS NOT ALL WHO WANDER ARE LOST I BELIEVE THE WRITING AT THE TOP OF THE DOOR IS ELVISH BUT I'M NOT SURE CAN ANYONE TRANSLATE IT
HE INHERITED THE RING AT WHICH IS THE AGE OF ADULTHOOD FOR HOBBITS SO BECAUSE OF NOT AGING HE PROBABLY LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE ON THE EDGE OF BEING AN ADULT
ISN'T MID S YOUNG FOR HOBBITS
ALWAYS PORTRAYED

AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IT'S ONLY PETER JACKSON THAT PORTRAYS FRODO THIS WAY
I GUESS IT GIVES A MORE DRAMATIC EFFECT TOWARDS THEIR ACROSS THE WORLD ADVENTURE
SPEND GET OFFICIAL LOAR COLLECTORS CHRISTMAS PRESENT SORTED
CONSIDERING YOU CAN GET JUST THE EXTENDED LOAR FOR THIS IS JUST A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE HOBBIT TRILOGY IS WORTH

I WISH IT WAS BUT I THINK I'D BE BUYING THIS BOSSET JUST FOR THE SAKE OF COMPLETION MORE THAN ANYTHING UNLESS THE HOBBIT SPECIAL FEATURES ARE PARTICULARLY WORTHWHILE
ASW THAT'S KIND OF CUTE DID YOU JUST NOT THINK ABOUT IT OR DID YOU THINK IT REFERRED TO ANOTHER CHARACTER


BUT IN ANY CASE SAID GLORFINDEL TO SEND THE RING TO HIM WOULD ONLY POSTPONE THE DAY OF EVIL HE IS FAR AWAY WE COULD NOT NOW TAKE IT BACK TO HIM UNGUESSED UNMARKED BY ANY SPY AND EVEN IF WE COULD SOON OR LATE THE LORD OF THE RINGS WOULD LEARN OF ITS HIDING PLACE AND WOULD BEND ALL HIS POWER TOWARDS IT COULD THAT POWER BE DEFIED BY BOBADIL ALONE I THINK NOT I THINK THAT IN THE END IF ALL ELSE IS CONQUERED BOBADIL WILL FALL LAST AS HE WAS FIRST AND THEN NIGHT WILL COME

I KNOW LITTLE OF IARWAIN SAVE THE NAME SAID GAELDOM BUT GLORFINDEL I THINK IS RIGHT POWER TO DEFY OUR ENEMY IS NOT IN HIM UNLESS SUCH POWER IS IN THE EARTH ITSELF AND YET WE SEE THAT SARON CAN TORTURE AND DESTROY THE VERY HILLS WHAT POWER STILL REMAINS LIES WITH US HERE IN IMLADRIS OR WITH BIRDMAN AT THE HAVENS OR IN LORIEN BUT HAVE THEY THE STRENGTH HAVE WE HERE THE STRENGTH TO WITHSTAND THE ENEMY THE COMING OF SARON AT THE LAST WHEN ALL ELSE IS OVERTHROWN

WITH ALL THIS TALK OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE ENEMY OUR ENEMY ETC WHO DID YOU THINK THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THEY MENTION LORD OF THE RINGS AND SARON ON THE SAME PAGE

YES I KNEW OF THEM INDEED I SPOKE OF THEM ONCE TO YOU FOR THE BLACK RIDERS ARE THE RINGWRAITHS THE NINE SERVANTS OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS BUT I DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY HAD ARISEN AGAIN OR I SHOULD HAVE FLED WITH YOU AT ONCE I HEARD NEWS OF THEM ONLY AFTER I LEFT YOU IN JUNE BUT THAT STORY MUST WAIT FOR THE MOMENT WE HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM DISASTER BY ARAGON

OR EVEN THE TITLE OF BILBO BOOK

HERE BILBO S HAND ENDED AND FRODO HAD WRITTEN

THE DOWNFALL

OF THE

LORD OF THE RINGS

AND THE

RETURN OF THE KING
YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS ONE OF THOSE PHRASES THAT BEING SO CULTURALLY UBIQUITOUS NOW REFERS ONLY TO ITSELF THE LORD OF RINGS IS THE FANTASY SERIES BY JNR TZOLKIN IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE FILMS OR READ THE BOOKS YOU WON'T REALISE THAT SARON IS THE EPONYMOUS LORD AND EVEN AFTER EXPERIENCING THE STORY THE TITLE STILL HAS THIS WEIRD QUALITY TO IT I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT WHAT I'M SAYING MAKES SENSE BUT THAT'S HOW IT SEEMS TO ME
WHO'D YOU THINK IT REFERRED TO THE BEARERS OF THE ONE OTHER THAN SARON ISILDUR GOLLUM BILBO FRODO THOSE WHO DID COULD NOT LORD OVER THE OTHER RINGS EVEN WITH THE ONE IN THEIR POSSESSION
THE BOOKS COULD ALTERNATIVELY BE TITLED SARON THAT TIME WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD BULLIED UP ON HIM TO DESTROY HIS RING
YOU SEEM LIKE A VERY BRIGHT PERSON


I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO THINK THAT THE CINEMA EDITION MIN HAVE THE PERFECT RUNNING TIME

PETER JACKSON AGREES WITH YOU THAT'S WHY THEY ARE EXTENDED CUTS NOT DIRECTOR'S CUTS IN THE INTRO TO THE EXT CUT HE SAYS THE THEATRICAL VERSION IS HIS PREFERRED CUT OF THE FILM THE EXT VERSIONS ARE PURELY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT MORE

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXTENDED EDITIONS AND THE DVD EXTENDED EDITIONS ANYONE KNOW
BOIL EM
WHAT'S PRECIOUS

THAT'S TOTALLY AWESOME
MY GRANDPA USED TO HAVE THAT EXACT SAME THING
THE DOUBLE CAPITAL T BOTHERS ME MORE THAN IT SHOULD
BOIL EM MASH EM STICK EM IN A STEW
SARON I SEE YOU ARAGON ELESSAR SHE WILL DIE THE LIGHT OF THE EVEN STAR FADES OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT
LINGUIST HERE IT'S ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF CLIPS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THE FIRST CLIP IS TWO LINES FROM A SINDARIN POEM THAT APPEARS FULLY IN FELLOWSHIP


SILIVREN PENNA MARIEL
O MEMEL ADLAR ENELATH

THIS IS A WEIRD CHOICE BECAUSE IT'S FROM A HYMN HONORING ONE OF THE ALAR THE SAME HYMN THAT SAM PARTIALLY QUOTES WHEN USING THE PHIAL OF GALADRIEL TO FEND OFF SHELDON I CHALK IT UP TO THE MOVIEMAKERS JUST NEEDING AUDIO BESIDES THE TEXT BUT IF WE TAKE IT AT FACE VALUE IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SARON MOCKING ARAGON WITH AN ELVISH HYMN HE SURELY KNOWS



THIS IS A CLEARER CLIP OF THE SAME LINE SILIVREN PENNA MARIEL ACCOMPANYING A VIEW OF FADING ARWEN WHICH MIGHT SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT SARON IS USING THIS TO MOCK ARAGON AFTER ALL IN FELLOWSHIP THE HYMN IS HEARD IN RIVENDELL



THIS IS A MISHMASH OF WORDS FROM THE BLACK SPEECH TEXT ON THE RING MORE RECOGNIZABLY IN VOICE THE ONLY CLEARLY AUDIBLE PHRASE IS WHICH IS FROM THE FINAL LINE OF THE INSCRIPTION AND MEANS IN THE DARKNESS THIS ALSO FALLS APPROPRIATELY OVER ARWEN

HOPE THIS HELPS
DOESNT THE DVD HAVE SUBTITLES
THEY ARE DRAFTS AND NOTES AND SOME NEW ESSAYS ANNOTATED BY CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN VERY INTERESTING IF YOUR INTERESTED IN THE WRITING PROCESS

DID YOU KNOW BEFORE ARAGON WAS WRITTEN INTO THE STORY THE HOBBITS MET AN OLD HOBBIT NICKNAMED TROTTER IN BREE NAMED SO BECAUSE HE LOST HIS FEET BEING TORTURED IN MORDOR AND WORE PROSTHETIC WOODEN FEET

THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF YOU FIND OUT

HERE HAVE AN EXCERPT THE UNPUBLISHED EPILOGUE FOR LORD OF THE RINGS WHERE SAM DISCUSSES THE STORY WITH HIS DAUGHTER ELABOR

IF YOU'VE READ THE HOBBIT AND LOAR AND ARE LOOKING FOR THE NEXT STEP READ THE SILMARILLION

THE RECYCLE BIN HAS TO GO IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER
WATCH OUT IF YOU HAVE AN SSD PONTIFY HAS AN ERROR WHERE IT DOES A TON OF EXTRA READ WRITES THIS WILL PREMATURELY SHRINK THEN KILL YOUR DRIVE

SOURCE

EDIT GREAT PICTURE ALSO SHADOW OF MORDOR IS GREAT OF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET
PREVIOUS SKETCHES
GANDALF AND THE BARONG
THE WATCHER IN THE WATER
INTERESTING TAKE MOST PEOPLE DRAW THEM AS SOME KIND OF FRUIT TREE PEACHES OR APRICOTS IMO BECAUSE THEY WERE FRUIT BEARING I LIKE THIS THOUGH
I REALLY FUCKING LIKE YOUR ARTWORK THIS STYLE IS SO DOPE DO YOU EVER DO CONTRACT WORK
VERY LOVELY
YEAH ORIGINALLY SHE LAUGHED HIM OFFICIAL HE HAD TO GO RUN THE RANGERS BEFORE SHE WOULD STOP CALLING HIM A KID
I DON'T FIND IT WEIRD THE ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE ABOUT AGE AND MATURITY IN HUMANS PROBABLY DON'T APPLY TO ELVES AMONGST HER PEOPLE ARWEN IS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG AMONGST HIS PEOPLE ARAGON IS CONSIDERED OLD THEY ARE BOTH YOUTHFUL IN APPEARANCE DESPITE THEIR AGE AND THEY ARE BOTH ADULTS IT'S OKAY
YEAH ACTUALLY IN FACT I FIND IT WEIRDER THAT HE WAS RAISED BY ELROD AND THEN ENDED UP FALLING IN LOVE WITH A DISTANT RELATIVE WHO WAS ALSO DAUGHTER BUT I THINK THAT AFTER A POINT IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE THEY'D BOTH FOUND SOMEONE THEY COULD SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES WITH AND BECAUSE ELVES LOOK ETERNALLY YOUNG CHURDAN BEING THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION SO EVEN IF ARWEN WAS I ASSUME HER MATURITY WAS THE SAME AS AFTER HE'D COME BACK FROM HIS QUEST PERHAPS ELVES JUST STOP MATURING AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD RATHER THAN PROGRESSING PAST THAT TO OLD AGE SENILITY HAVEN'T READ HOME IN YEARS SO MOST OF THIS IS CONJECTURE

PLUS IT'S TZOLKIN THIS IS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT US BEDEN AND

THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF THE SERIES IT IS WEIRD YES BUT ARAGON WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST MEN ALIVE AND HE WAS CHARMING

I DON'T SEE WHY ARWEN WOULDN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM
ELROD ALWAYS TOLD HER YOU CAN'T START DATING TIL YOU'RE AT LEAST HUNDRED
THE HOBBITS ART THE RACE THAT SAVED MIDDLE EARTH WEIRDER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED
MATURE IS RELATIVE CATS CAN GET PREGNANT AT SIX MONTHS HUMANS MATURE FASTER THAN ELVES MELIAN WAS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLDER AT LEAST THAN THINGAL ELROD WAS SEVERAL HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND OR MORE YEARS OLDER THAN CELEBRATING LÚTHIEN WAS THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLDER THAN BEDEN ARAGON IS A MATURE MANUAL ARWEN IS A MATURE REGARDING FINDING SOMEONE IN ALL OF THAT TIME ELROD DID NOT MARRY CELEBRATING UNTIL HE WAS OVER YEARS OLD THIS TENDED TO HAPPEN AMONG THE DÚNEDAIN AS WELL WHO MARRIED LATE IN LIFE ARAGON WAS NEAR WHEN HE GOT MARRIED BOOMIER WAS OVER AND NOT YET MARRIED HIS FATHER GOT MARRIED WHEN HE WAS THE LAST KING OF CONDOR GOT KILLED WHEN HE WAS OR AT LEAST CAPTURED AND KILLED LATER AND HE WAS NOT MARRIED YET THE LAST KING OF AFNOR DID NOT GET MARRIED UNTIL HE WAS NEARLY
LOVE IS POWERFUL AND STRANGE
I FOR ONE WILL NEVER LISTEN TO THAT MUSIC THE SAME WAY THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT ALSO I TOTALLY AGREE ABOUT HOWARD SHORE'S MUSICAL GENIUS THE FILM WOULDN'T BE HALF THE FILM IT ACTUALLY IS WITHOUT HIM
THERE'S ACTUALLY A MASSIVE BOOK OUT THERE ABOUT THE MUSIC OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS BY A GUY NAMED DOUG ADAMS IT EXPLORES LOTS OF STUFF LIKE THIS THE DIFFERENT CHANGES TO THEMES INSTRUMENTATION CHOICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SHOWING JUST HOW MUCH THOUGHT SHORE PUT INTO EVERY PART OF THE MUSIC DEFINITELY WORTH A READ
THE THEME OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING IS ONLY HEARD ONCE FULLY IN ALL THREE MOVIES AT THE COUNCIL OF ELROD EVERY PIECE AND INSTRUMENT IS PRESENT

AFTER THAT YOU NEVER EVER AGAIN HEAR THE WHOLE THING IT COMES CLOSE A FEW TIMES BUT AFTER THE DEATH OF BOOMIER AND FURTHER GROUP SPLINTERS YOU GET THE IDEA

THE MOVIES ARE FULL OF LITTLE THINGS LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY IN THE MUSIC REALM
HOWARD SHORE'S WORK ON LOAR ALONE CONVINCES ME THAT HE'S THE GREATEST COMPOSER OF OUR TIME IT'S AMAZING WHAT HE MANAGED TO DO WITH THIS SCORE AND YET AFTER LOAR HE NEVER PRODUCED ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THIS LEVEL AGAIN IT'S SO WEIRD
AS A MAJOR FAN OF BIG SCORE COMPOSERS THIS WAS A GREAT THING TO READ AND DISCOVER
THIS IS THE BEST THING I'VE READ IN AGES THANK YOU
PRETTY SURE THE THEME THAT PLAYS WHEN COLLAPSES IS IN FACT THEME IN A MAJOR KEY WHICH MAKES IT SOUND GLORIOUS INSTEAD OF
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THAT MOMENT NOW I LOVE IT EVEN MORE THANKS
THIS IS GREAT I REALLY FEEL SOME KIND OF DEEP PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THIS CAN'T EXPLAIN IT I'LL JUST CHALK IT UP TO THE BEAUTY OF MUSIC AND ESPECIALLY THAT OF HOWARD SHORE'S
THAT IS SO AWESOME I HAVE PRETTY MUCH ZERO MUSIC KNOWLEDGE SO I CAN'T ANALYZE THINGS VERY WELL SO IT'S GREAT TO FINALLY UNDERSTAND HOW MUSICALLY THAT PIECE COMMUNICATES THAT MESSAGE I THINK THEY KIND OF COMMUNICATE THE SAME THING WITH THE VISUALS TOO MORDOR LOSES THAT ORANGEY HARSH LIGHTING AND I THINK IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE SEE ACTUAL SUNLIGHT THERE THAT MOMENT WHERE EVIL GOES AWAY AND EVEN MORDOR BECOMES BEAUTIFUL IS JUST WOW
ARE BEING STRAIGHT UP DICKS DOWNVOTING MURRAY WHO HAS DIFFERENT TASTE IN MUSIC I'D EXPECT BETTER FROM TZOLKIN FANS
I NOTICED THAT PART LAST TIME I DID A MARATHON VERY EMOTIONAL
THE FAFF BASS CLEF HORN LINES ARE SO BADASS
THIS IS AWESOME JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE MUSIC FOR LOAR BUT I HOPE PEOPLE DO REALIZE THAT THE MUSIC FOR THE HOBBIT FILMS IS ALSO AWESOME
THROWS UP THE HORNS

METAL
COULD YOU POST A SECTION WHERE WE CAN HEAR THAT EARLIER VARIATION WHERE THE BRASS IS DISCORDANT I'D LOVE TO HEAR AND COMPARE THEM
THE RING ISN'T SENDING OUT HOMING SIGNALS LATER ON FRODO IS BEING HUNTED BECAUSE THERE IS EVIDENCE POINTING SERVANTS TO HIM

GOLLUM SNEAKS INTO MORDOR AND IS TORTURED REVEALING LOCATION IN THE SHIRE

HOBBITS IN THE SHIRE THEN GIVE THE NAGUAL DIRECTIONS TO HOUSE

AFTER THAT THEY ARE TRACKED UNTIL RIVENDELL THROUGH MUNDANE MEANS THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT THE NAGUAL ARE JUST RIDING UP AND DOWN THE ROADS LOOKING FOR SIGNS OF THE PARTY
THE MOVIES CAST A LIGHT OF MISUNDERSTANDING ON HOW THE ONE RING WORKS

THE FILMS WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT EACH TIME THE RING IS WORN ATTENTION IS DRAWN IN THAT DIRECTION HOWEVER WE LEARN IN THE NOVELS THAT SAM PUTS ON THE RING AFTER THE FIGHT WITH SHILOH AND HE IS ABLE TO ENTER INTO THE TOWER OF CRITH DUNGOL BECAUSE OF THE INVISIBILITY THE RING PROVIDES ATTENTION IS NOT DRAWN EVEN THOUGH HE IS THAT CLOSE TO MORDOR
UNIQUELY LONG POSSESSION OF THE RING STEMS FROM TWO PRIMARY FACTORS BUT SAYING THAT THE OTHER POSSESSORS WERE HUNTED IMMEDIATELY IS INACCURATE

THE FIRST IS THAT NO ONE KNEW THAT THE RING HAD BEEN FOUNDATION MOST OF THE LEADERS OF MEN AND ELVES FIGURED THAT THE RING HAD WASHED DOWN THE ALNUIN INTO THE SEA LOST FOREVER SAURURAN AND SARON KNEW THAT ISILDUR HAD BEEN KILLED AT GLADDEN FIELDS SO THEY PAINSTAKINGLY SEARCHED UP AND DOWN THE ALNUIN NEAR THERE TRYING TO FIND THE RING IT WASN'T UNTIL GOLLUM WAS CAUGHT NEAR MORDOR BY SERVANTS OF THE ENEMY THAT SARON FOUND OUT THAT THE RING HAD BEEN NOT ONLY FOUND BUT WAS IN THE POSSESSION OF BILBO BAGGIES OF THE SHIRE THAT'S WHEN THE NINE LEFT MINAS MOGUL IN SEARCH OF THE RING

THE OTHER FACTOR WAS THE ALMOST ABSOLUTE ISOLATION THAT GOLLUM SUBJECTED HIMSELF TO AFTER HE CAME TO BE IN POSSESSION OF THE RING HE WENT TO THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AND REMAINED THERE UNTIL HE LOST THE RING THERE WAS QUITE SIMPLY ALMOST NO CHANCE OF GOLLUM BEING DISCOVERED OR THE RING FOUND SO LONG AS HE HAD IT IN THE MOUNTAINS THAT HE DROPPED THE RING AND BILBO FOUND IT IS THE ONLY REASON THE RING MANAGED TO LEAVE THE MOUNTAINS

AND AS I SAID SAYING THAT GOLLUM WAS UNIQUE TO HOLDING THE RING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IS INACCURATE AS WELL THERE WERE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAD THE RING SINCE ITS CREATION SARON ISILDUR DECAGON SMEAGOL BILBO FRODO AND IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL ISILDUR MIGHT HAVE LIVED A VERY LONG LIFE AND BEEN CORRUPTED BY THE RING BUT WALKED FACE FIRST INTO AN ORC AMBUSH DECAGON WAS KILLED BY HIS COUSIN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER FINDING IT BILBO WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE RING FOR OVER SIXTY YEARS AND NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANY TROUBLE BECAUSE OF IT FRODO AND SAM WERE THE ONLY ONES HUNTED FOR IT AND ONLY BECAUSE GOLLUM WAS CAUGHT SKULKING NEAR MORDOR AND THE ENEMY HAD LEARNED OF THE RECOVERY
BILBO FINDING THE RING MORE OR LESS COINCIDES WITH THE WHITE COUNCIL ATTACKING DOL GOLDER WHICH SARON EXPECTED AND SARON MOVED TO MORDOR AND PROCLAIMED HIMSELF OPENLY A LONG TIME AFTER THAT HE MANAGED TO TORTURE GOLLUM TO GET THE NAME AND LOCATION OF BILBO THAT IS WHEN THE RINGWRAITHS STARTED TO SEARCH FOR THE SHIRE
I BELIEVE IT IS MENTIONED THAT SARON HAD BEEN SPENDING THAT TIME GATHERING HIS STRENGTH ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE RING BUT NEVER BEING SO BOLD AS TO SEND RIDERS INTO CIVILIZATION AS HIS STRENGTH DEVELOPED HIS CONFIDENCE GREW IMO
DO YOU WANT ENGLISH IN ELVISH TEXT TENGWAR OR ELVISH IN ROMAN LETTERS OR ELVISH IN TENGWAR LETTERS

ALSO DO YOU WANT QUENDA ELVISH OR SINDARIN ELVISH

THE FOLKS AT R QUENDA AND R TENGWAR CAN PROBABLY HELP ANYWAY

CONGRATULATIONS AND GOOD LUCK
NOW MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO READ THE SILMARILLION THEN COME BACK TO LOAR AND YOU'LL SEE ALL THE REFERENCES TO THE SIL
THIS PRETTY MUCH HAPPENED TO ME I READ THE BOOKS FOR THE FIRST TIME EARLIER THIS SUMMER JULY AND LAST MONTH I HAD THIS RANDOM ITCH TO THE FELLOWSHIP EVEN THOUGH I HAVE LIKE BOOKS ON MY TR LIST NOW I'M READING THE SILMARILLION OH WELL I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING HAHA
BLOODY HELL I'M JEALOUS I SAY GO ON TO THE SIL
THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF FORESHADOWING THAT YOU WON'T GET ON A FIRST READ SO IT'S DEFINITELY A GOOD IDEA TO ALSO READ THE APPENDICES AND PERHAPS CHECK OUT THE SILMARILLION BECAUSE BOTH THOSE THINGS PROVIDE A LOT OF BACKGROUND TO READING LOAR AGAIN
I READ THE HOBBIT THEN SILMARILION THEN I REREAD BOTH
COULD YOU BUY IT OFF SOMEONE WHO HAS THE BOSSET
I OWN THE SET PICTURED ABOVE AND THERE IS NO SEPARATE MAP THE MAP SEEN IS THE ON INSIDE OF THE FRONT OF THE BOX THAT FOLDS OPEN THE MAP ON THE BOX HOWEVER IS VERY NICE BUT NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO FRAME
DP REF IE DTF QID SR KEYWORDS MAP OF MIDDLE EARTH IM NOT SURE IF THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT THIS IS WHAT I USED TO HAVE LOOKED GOOD I THINK
LOOKS GOOD
WHILE I FIND BOTH STORYLINES GREAT I DO AGREE THAT THE PARTS WITH ARAGON PERGOLAS AND GIMLI ARE MUCH MORE INTERESTING IN THE BOOKS AND THE MOVIES
THE TOWER OF CRITH DUNGOL AND THE DECISIONS OF MASTER PALMWISE ARE REALLY THE ONLY CHAPTERS THAT I ENJOY WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR JOURNEY ALONE
I THINK THE FIRST FEW BITS AFTER THE PERSPECTIVE SHIFT IN TT ARE A BIT DULL BUT ONCE THEY MEET FARAMIR IT PICKS UP DRAMATICALLY THE WHOLE SHELDON CRITH DUNGOL SEQUENCE IS ONE OF THE MOST THRILLING PARTS OF THE STORY TO ME

I GET WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM THOUGH I ALWAYS RUSH MERRY AND BIG DUMB FOREST ADVENTURE I LIKE THOSE PARTS FINE BUT DAMMIT I WANNA KNOW WHAT MY BOYS ARE DOING IN ROHAN
BEST PART OF TRILOGY IN MY OPINION THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FELLOWSHIP HAVE STRENGTH BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THE ONE RING THE REAL BATTLE IS STRUGGLE WITH THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF THE RING AND HIS JOURNEY INTO THE HEART OF EVIL THE LAND OF MORDOR THIS WOULD ALL RING HOLLOW IF EXPERIENCE WAS ANYTHING LESS THAN WHAT TZOLKIN PUT DOWN WHAT I MISS FROM THE BOOKS THAT THE FILMS COULDN'T CAPTURE WAS THE SENSE OF TIME AND DISTANCE THE JOURNEY OF FRODO AND SAM IS LONG AND GRUELING AND YOU BECOME NUMB TO THE ANGUISH LONG BEFORE IT'S OVER IT IS STORY OF THE GREAT WAR
THEY ARE THE SCARIEST AND SADDEST MOST EMOTIONAL PARTS HOW ANYONE CAN'T SEE THESE THINGS IN IT IS BEYOND ME THEY JOURNEY IS HARD FOR ALL THE JOURNEY BREAKS FRODO
YEAH I TRY TO FLY THROUGH THE SAM FRODO CHAPTERS AS FAST AS I CAN SO I CAN GET BACK TO GANDALF AND ARAGON
I THINK THOSE BITS ABOUT SAM AND FRODO HAVE INTERESTING BITS BUT I FIND MYSELF THE PARTS ABOUT THE REST OF THE FELLOWSHIP IN ROHAN AND CONDOR MUCH MORE OFTEN
I USED TO FEEL THIS WAY ON MY FIRST READ MANY YEARS AGO BUT I APPRECIATE FRODO AND SAM PARTS MORE WITH EACH
WHAT ABOUT THE INTERNAL BATTLE OF GOLLUM VS SMEAGOL AND DIFFERENT WAYS THAT FRODO AND SAM REACT IT'S CRITICAL TO THE WHOLE STORY NOT AS THOUGH ADMITTEDLY
WELL YES NOW THAT I THINK OF IT BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY AREN'T INTERESTING IT IS BECAUSE THE OTHER STUFF IS SO GOOD THAT IT OVERSHADOWS EVEN THE GREATNESS OF FRODO AND IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL

BOOKS AND ALSO BREAK UP A BIT MORE ALTERNATELY FOCUSING ON MERRY PIPPIN OR ARAGON
I ENJOY BOTH OF THEM ABOUT EQUALLY I GET ABSORBED INTO BOTH OF THE PLOTS AND AT THE END OF EACH SWITCH FIND MYSELF WANTING TO CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT STORY UNTIL THE NEXT ONE GETS ME HOOKED AGAIN
I'M WITH YOU THOSE CHAPTERS ARE A SLOG TZOLKIN IS PERHAPS TOO GOOD AT MAKING THE READER MISERABLE WHICH WAS CLEARLY THE INTENT

I HAVE A CASSETTE EYE RADIO PLAY OF THE LOAR IN MY CAR THAT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO ON REPEAT FOR ABOUT YEARS I'M ON MY TRIP THROUGH THE THING MY CAR HAS NO ANTENNA SO NO RADIO AND I PRETTY MUCH SKIP THE SIDES WITH SAM FRODO AND SMÉAGOL BECAUSE THEY'RE DEPRESSING AND WHINY GOLLUM IN PARTICULAR IS A PROBLEM HE'S ONE OF THOSE CHARACTERS LIKE HAMLET OR KING RICHARD III THAT JUST MAKES ACTORS LOSE THEIR SHIT AND GO FULL HAM

ALSO I KNOW THE EYE RADIO PLAY IS DEPRECATED BY MOST FANS IN FAVOR OF THE BBC RADIO PLAY BUT FUCK THAT THOUGH SOME OF THE PRONUNCIATIONS OF THE NAMES ARE CRINGE SAH ROO MON BERNARD MAYS DID A FANTASTIC JOB OF ADAPTING THE LOAR FOR RADIO IT HEWS MUCH CLOSER TO THE BOOKS THAN THE BBC VERSION AND IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS EVER
I'M ACTUALLY THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE I FOUND SAM AND PARTS IN BOTH THE TWO TOWERS AND THE RETURN OF THE KING TO BE MORE INTERESTING TO READ MAYBE IT'S COMEDIC YET IMPACTFUL DIALOGUE OR READING LINES WITH ANDY SARKIS VOICE IN MY HEAD BUT I'VE GONE BACK AND READ THE SECOND PART OF THE TWO TOWERS JUST BECAUSE I LOVED THEIR JOURNEY SO MUCH
I HAVE TO ADMIT WHEN I TRIED READING THE SERIES YEARS AGO I ONLY MADE IT UNTIL HALFWAY THROUGH THE TWO TOWERS BEFORE GIVING UP I'M GIVING IT ANOTHER SHOT NOW SO HOPEFULLY I'LL BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE IT MORE
YESSSSSSSSSSS ALTHOUGH I GET THE IMPRESSION IT'S LIKE THIS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN I WONDER IF THE CHANGE IN PACE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WAY OF EXPLAINING MAKES IT HARDER TO READ I KNOW IT DOES FOR ME
I LIKE THE QUICK PACE OF THE FELLOWSHIPS JOURNEY AND BATTLES AND INFO DUMPING REGARDING GANDALF BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE DETAILS AND HISTORY THAT IS PRESENT WITH SAM AND FRODO IT IS A LOT SLOWER PACE SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IT CAN FEEL DRAWN OUT AND BORING BUT I LIKE BOTH EQUALLY FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
TRY READING THE CHAPTER MINAS TIGRISH IN RETURN OF THE KING WHEN IT DESCRIBES THE CITY AND THE WALL SURROUNDING IT AND STUFF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPREHEND
YEP KINDA BORING MUST DO TO FINISH FRODO WAS ANNOYING TO ME AND SAM HAD A CRUSH ON HIM
TO THIS DAY DESPITE MY DEEP LOVE FOR THE BOOKS AND THE FRANCHISE AS A WHOLE I CANNOT GET THROUGH THE SPILT UP FORMAT OF TNT THE SAM AND FRODO SEGMENT IS DOWNRIGHT DROLL
EAGLES ARE THE MESSENGERS OF FANWE SINCE GANDALF IS REALLY THE ONLY ONE THAT STAYED TRUE TO HIS PURPOSE ON MIDDLE EARTH I THINK IT MADE SENSE FOR HIM TO RELY ON THEIR HELP PLUS HE SAVED GWALIOR AFTER HE WAS SHOT WITH AN ARROW SO THAT CERTAINLY HELPED

SOMETHING ON BACKGROUND THE CREATOR ERU ILÚVATAR CREATED THE AINU MORE OR LESS ANGELS AND TOGETHER THEY CREATED THE WORLD THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE AINU WERE CALLED THE ALAR AND THEY WERE THE GUARDIANS OF THE EARTH THEN ERU CREATED ELVES AND LATER MEN THOSE HAVE MOSTLY FREE WILL BUT BY THE THIRD AGE THE TIME OF THE EVENTS OF LOAR THEIR AID TO ELVES AND MEN IS MOSTLY JUST GUIDANCE THE ALAR SENT THE WIZARDS TO MIDDLE-EARTH WHO WERE NOT ALLOWED TO FORCE PEOPLE TO FIGHT AGAINST SARON BUT JUST TO GUIDE THEM NOW MANAWA IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE ALAR AND HE IS ALSO THE ONE WHO IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EAGLES THE EAGLES OF MANAWA THE ALAR DEBATE HOW TO PROTECT THE ANIMALS AND THE TREES FROM PEOPLE SAVANNA AND KEMENTÁRI ARE NAMES FOR THE SAME PERSON AUL IS THE ONE WHO CREATED THE MOUNTAINS AND THE DWARVES

THAT ALSO SHALL COME TO BE BY THE HEED OF ILÚVATAR AND BEFORE THE CHILDREN AWAKE THERE SHALL GO FORTH WITH
WINGS LIKE THE WIND THE EAGLES OF THE LORDS OF THE WESTERN

THEN SAVANNA WAS GLAD AND SHE STOOD UP REACHING HER ARMS TOWARDS THE HEAVENS AND SHE SAID HIGH SHALL
CLIMB THE TREES OF KEMENTÁRI THAT THE EAGLES OF THE KING MAY HOUSE THEREIN

BUT MANAWA ROSE ALSO AND IT SEEMED THAT HE STOOD TO SUCH A HEIGHT THAT HIS VOICE CAME DOWN TO SAVANNA AS FROM
THE PATHS OF THE WINDS

NAY HE SAID ONLY THE TREES OF AUL WILL BE TALL ENOUGH IN THE MOUNTAINS THE EAGLES SHALL HOUSE AND HEAR THE
VOICES OF THOSE WHO CALL UPON US BUT IN THE FORESTS SHALL WALK THE SHEPHERDS OF THE TREES

THIS IS THE STORY OF THE CREATION OF BOTH THE EAGLES AND THE ANTS SHEPHERD OF THE TREES

NOW THE ALAR DON'T INTERFERE THAT MUCH BUT THEY STILL SUPPORT THE GOOD GUYS A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING REALLY HEROIC THE EAGLES OF MANAWA COME TO AID THEM YOU'LL NOTICE THAT IN BOTH THE HOBBIT AND LOAR THE EAGLES ONLY ARRIVE AFTER THE GOOD GUYS HAVE DECIDED TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND GANDALF WAS ALSO SENT BY MANAWA SO THEY HAVE THAT IN COMMON THE ALAR WILL NOT FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT FOR THE GOOD GUYS BUT THEY AID THE FREE PEOPLES IN MORE SUBTLE WAYS SUCH AS BY SENDING EAGLES AND WIZARDS AND THE SUN AND MOON THE WINDS ALSO SEEM TO CHANGE TO SUIT THE GOOD GUYS ARAGON IS SPED TO MINAS TIGRISH BY A CHANGING WIND
GANDALF HAD ONCE SAVED THE LORD OF THE EAGLES FROM A POISONED ARROW AND SO THEY FELT THEY OWED HIM A FEW FAVORS HE COULD NOT CALL ON THEM AT ANY TIME AND HE HAD NO POWER TO COMMAND THEM
AMAZON EBAY BETSY
IN THE BLACK SPEECH NO LESS

БОГАТСТВО
REPLICA RING YEAH NICE TRY SARON
FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUCH A SUPERFAN YOU HAD ALL THE BOOKS IN ELVISH I NOW REALIZE THAT IS CYRILLIC I AM NOT A SMART MANUAL
КРУТО
I THINK I KNOW BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT LANGUAGE IS THAT
I FOR SURE THOUGHT THIS WAS RUSSIAN UNTIL I TRIED TO READ IT AND SAW THAT WHAT IS CALLED A HARD SIGN ТВEРДЫЙ ЗНАК IS NOT USED LIKE A HARD SIGN I'M REALLY NOT SURE HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO READ IT IN WHAT IS THIS BULGARIAN
SINCE MY BULGARIAN GAME IS WEAK ARE ANY OF THESE THE LAST RINGBARKER
BIRTHDAY GIFT YEAH RIGHT WHERE'S THE BODY
I HAVE THE RING TOO
THIS IS MOVIE STUFF ALSO IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE

IN THE ROK

A STRUGGLE SOMEWHAT GRIMMER FOR MY PART THAN THE BATTLE OF THE HORNBURG ANSWERED ARAGON I HAVE LOOKED IN THE STONE OF ORTHANT MY FRIENDS

YOU HAVE LOOKED IN THAT ACCURSED STONE OF WIZARDRY EXCLAIMED GIMLI WITH FEAR AND ASTONISHMENT IN HIS FACE DID YOU SAY AUGHT TO HIM EVEN GANDALF FEARED THAT ENCOUNTER

YOU FORGET TO WHOM YOU SPEAK SAID ARAGON STERNLY AND HIS EYES GLINTED DID I NOT OPENLY PROCLAIM MY TITLE BEFORE THE DOORS OF EDORA WHAT DO YOU FEAR THAT I SHOULD SAY TO HIM NAY GIMLI HE SAID IN A SOFTER VOICE AND THE GRIMNESS LEFT HIS FACE AND HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAS LABOURED IN SLEEPLESS PAIN FOR MANY NIGHTS NAY MY FRIENDS I AM THE LAWFUL MASTER OF THE STONE AND I HAD BOTH THE RIGHT AND THE STRENGTH TO USE IT OR SO I JUDGED THE RIGHT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THE STRENGTH WAS ENOUGH BARELY

HE DREW A DEEP BREATH IT WAS A BITTER STRUGGLE AND THE WEARINESS IS SLOW TO PASSIVE I SPOKE NO WORD TO HIM AND IN THE END I WRENCHED THE STONE TO MY OWN WILLIAM THAT ALONE HE WILL FIND HARD TO ENDURE AND HE BEHELD ME YES MASTER GIMLI HE SAW ME BUT IN OTHER GUISE THAN YOU SEE ME HERE IF THAT WILL AID HIM THEN I HAVE DONE ILL BUT I DO NOT THINK SO TO KNOW THAT I LIVED AND WALKED THE EARTH WAS A BLOW TO HIS HEART I DEEM FOR HE KNEW IT NOT TILL NOW THE EYES IN ORTHANT DID NOT SEE THROUGH THE ARMOUR OF THRODDEN BUT SARON HAS NOT FORGOTTEN ISILDUR AND THE SWORD OF ELENDIL NOW IN THE VERY HOUR OF HIS GREAT DESIGNS THE HEIR OF ISILDUR AND THE SWORD ARE REVEALED FOR L SHOWED THE BLADE TO HIM HE IS NOT SO MIGHTY YET THAT HE IS ABOVE FEAR NAY DOUBT EVER GNAWS HIM

BUT HE WIELDS GREAT DOMINION NONETHELESS SAID GIMLI AND NOW HE WILL STRIKE MORE SWIFTLY

THE HASTY STROKE GOES OFT ASTRAY SAID ARAGON WE MUST PRESS OUR ENEMY AND NO LONGER WAIT UPON HIM FOR THE MOVE SEE MY FRIENDS WHEN I HAD MASTERED THE STONE I LEARNED MANY THINGS A GRAVE PERIL I SAW COMING UNLOOKED-FOR UPON CONDOR FROM THE SOUTH THAT WILL DRAW OFF GREAT STRENGTH FROM THE DEFENCE OF MINAS TIGRISH IF IT IS NOT COUNTERED SWIFTLY I DEEM THAT THE CITY WILL BE LOST ERE TEN DAYS BE GONE

ARAGON ALREADY KNEW OF THE DECISION ARWEN WOULD HAVE TO MAKE ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT YEARS BEFORE WHEN HE FIRST MET HER THIS CONVERSATION HAPPENED BETWEEN HIM AND HIS UNCLE

SHE IS TOO FAR ABOVE YOU AND SO I THINK IT MAY WELL SEEM TO HERALDRY BUT EVEN IF IT WERE NOT SO AND HER HEART TURNED TOWARDS YOU I SHOULD STILL BE GRIEVED BECAUSE OF THE DOOM THAT IS LAID ON US

WHAT IS THAT DOOM SAID ARAGON

THAT SO LONG AS I ABIDE HERE SHE SHALL LIVE WITH THE YOUTH OF THE ELDAR ANSWERED ELROD AND WHEN I DEPART SHE SHALL GO WITH ME IF SHE SO CHOOSES

I SEE SAID ARAGON THAT I HAVE TURNED MY EYES TO A TREASURE NO LESS DEAR THAN THAN THE TREASURE OF THINGAL THAT BEDEN ONCE DESIRED SUCH IS MY FATE THEN SUDDENLY THE FORESIGHT OF HIS KINDRED CAME TO HIM AND HE SAID BUT LO MASTER ELROD THE YEARS OF YOUR ABIDING RUN SHORT AT LAST AND THE CHOICE MUST SOON BE LAID ON YOUR CHILDREN TO PART EITHER WITH YOU OR WITH MIDDLE-EARTH

TRULY SAID ELROD SOON AS WE ACCOUNT IT THOUGH MANY YEARS OF MEN MUST STILL PASSIVE BUT THERE WILL BE NO CHOICE BEFORE ARWEN MY BELOVED UNLESS YOU ARAGON SON COME BETWEEN US AND BRING ONE OF US YOU OR ME TO A BITTER PARTING BEYOND THE END OF THE WORLD THE TALE OF ARAGON AND ARWEN
I'VE FLICKED THROUGH THE LETTERS OF JNR TZOLKIN FOR YOU AND CAN SAY THAT THE ANSWER DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THERE IF THE ANSWER IS ANYWHERE IT WILL BE IN THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH BOOKS WHICH CONTAIN ALL OF DRAFTS AND NOTES UNFORTUNATELY I ONLY HAVE VOLUME IX AND I THINK FOR IS COVERED IN VOLUME VI

YOU MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE MORE LUCK OVER IN R TOLKIENFANS WHERE PEOPLE ARE A BIT MORE BOOK FOCUSED AND I KNOW AT LEAST A FEW PEOPLE HAVE THE FULL HOME SET
SOUNDS LIKE KIPLING
BY THE THIRD AGE BELERIAND HAD BEEN SUNK BENEATH THE SEA SO THE BLUE MOUNTAINS WHICH HAD BEEN FAR INLAND ARE NOW CLOSE TO THE COASTLINE

THIS POST SUMS UP THE CHANGES IN GEOGRAPHY NICELY
ITS THE SAME MOUNTAIN RANGE BELERIAND SANK DURING THE WAR OF WRATH SO THE BLUE MOUNTAINS ARE CLOSER TO THE SEA FROM THE SECOND AGE ONWARDS

I BELIEVE LINDON DIRECTLY TO THE WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS IS WHAT USED TO BE OSSIRIAND
GREAT STORY WHAT RIVER WAS THIS CIRC JACKSON USED SEVERAL RIVERS TO REPRESENT ALNUIN AT DIFFERENT POINTS
GREAT READ THANKS
IT WAS MEANT TO BE
HE'S REFERRING TO ERU ILUVATAR ERU INTERFERED SLIGHTLY IN A FEW KEY MOMENTS ONE OF THOSE WAS BILBO FINDING THE RING ANOTHER IS WHEN GOLLUM FELL INTO THE CRACK OF DOOM FOR EXAMPLE
A RING OF POWER LOOKS AFTER ITSELF FRODO IT MAY SLIP OFF TREACHEROUSLY BUT ITS KEEPER NEVER ABANDONS IT AT MOST HE PLAYS WITH THE IDEA OF HANDING IT ON TO SOMEONE ELSE S CARE AND THAT ONLY AT AN EARLY STAGE WHEN IT FIRST BEGINS TO GRIP BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW BILBO ALONE IN HISTORY HAS EVER GONE BEYOND PLAYING AND REALLY DONE IT HE NEEDED ALL MY HELP TOO AND EVEN SO HE WOULD NEVER HAVE JUST FORSAKEN IT OR CAST IT ASIDE IT WAS NOT GOLLUM FRODO BUT THE RING ITSELF THAT DECIDED THINGS THE RING LEFT HIM
WHAT JUST IN TIME TO MEET BILBO SAID FRODO WOULDN T AN ORC
HAVE SUITED IT BETTER

IT IS NO LAUGHING MATTER SAID GANDALF NOT FOR YOU IT WAS THE STRANGEST EVENT IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE RING SO FAR BILBO S ARRIVAL JUST AT THAT TIME AND PUTTING HIS HAND ON IT BLINDLY IN THE DARK
THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE POWER AT WORK FRODO THE RING WAS TRYING TO GET BACK TO ITS MASTER IT HAD SLIPPED FROM ISILDUR S HAND AND BETRAYED HIM THEN WHEN A CHANCE CAME IT CAUGHT POOR DÉAGOL AND HE WAS MURDERED AND AFTER THAT GOLLUM AND IT HAD DEVOURED HIM IT COULD MAKE NO FURTHER USE OF HIM HE WAS TOO SMALL AND MEAN AND AS LONG AS IT STAYED WITH HIM HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS DEEP POOL AGAIN SO NOW WHEN ITS MASTER WAS AWAKE ONCE MORE AND SENDING OUT HIS DARK THOUGHT FROM KIRKWOOD IT ABANDONED GOLLUM ONLY TO BE PICKED UP BY THE MOST UNLIKELY PERSON IMAGINABLE BILBO FROM THE SHIRE

BEHIND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE AT WORK BEYOND ANY DESIGN OF THE I CAN PUT IT NO PLAINER THAN BY SAYING THAT BILBO WAS MEANT TO FIND THE RING AND NOT BY ITS MAKER IN WHICH CASE YOU ALSO WERE MEANT TO HAVE IT AND THAT MAYBE AN ENCOURAGING THOUGHT

AS U WILLIE SAYS THIS IS REFERRING TO ERU ILLUVATAR WHO IS ALSO KNOWN AS GOD AS IN THE CHRISTIAN GOD NOTE IN THE BOOK THIS TAKES PLACE IN THE SHIRE WHEN FRODO AND GANDALF HAVE A LONG CONVERSATION AND SAM IS EAVESDROPPING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW NOT IN MORIA

HEY IT'S ME YOUR GIRLFRIEND I'D LIKE MY BOOKS BACK
I'M KIND OF JEALOUS
AWESOME TO SEE THEY HAVE MADE THE MOVIES INTO BOOKS
AHOUH WOW THAT'S SO COOL I LOVE GAME OF THRONES
STRAIGHT UP WIFE MATERIAL
YOU MEAN YOUR MOM YOU DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
YOUR F IS FAT
ELVES ARE BOUND TO ARDA EARTH WHILE MEN'S SOULS GET TO LEAVE IT WHEN THEY DIE TO AN UNKNOWN AFTERLIFE ARWEN CHOSE TO BE MORTAL SO SHE SUPPOSEDLY SHARES AN AFTERLIFE WHEN ARAGON DIED ARWEN WENT TO LOTHLÓRIEN AFTER ARAGON WAS GONE AND LAID DOWN AND THERE SHE DIED

THE PENDANT IS NOT IN THE BOOK AS SUCH I THINK ARAGON EVEN DROPS IT IN THE MOVIES AND IT BREAKS BUT THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE IT

YET MAYBE THIS WILL LIGHTEN YOUR HEART SAID GALADRIEL FOR IT WAS
LEFT IN MY CARE TO BE GIVEN TO YOU SHOULD YOU PASS THROUGH THIS LAND THEN
SHE LIFTED FROM HER LAP A GREAT STONE OF A CLEAR GREEN SET IN A SILVER BROOCH
THAT WAS WROUGHT IN THE LIKENESS OF AN EAGLE WITH OUTSPREAD WINGS AND AS SHE
HELD IT UP THE GEM FLASHED LIKE THE SUN SHINING THROUGH THE LEAVES OF SPRING

THIS STONE I GAVE TO CELEBRÍAN MY DAUGHTER AND SHE TO HERS AND NOW IT COMES
TO YOU AS A TOKEN OF HOPE IN THIS HOUR TAKE THE NAME THAT WAS FORETOLD FOR
YOU ELESSAR THE ELFSTONE OF THE HOUSE OF ELENDIL

SO HE RECEIVES A BROOCH BELONGING TO ARWEN THOUGH IT WAS GIVEN BY GALADRIEL ALSO ARAGON GIVES THE RING OF BARASHIT TO ARWEN AND THAT RING WAS MADE BY ELVES LONG AGO AND BECAME A HEIRLOOM OF ANCESTORS
HIS NAME WAS HALDI HE ONLY SHOWS UP AT DEEP IN THE FILMS IN THE BOOK HE IS THE BORDER GUARD THAT FINDS THEM AS THEY ENTER LOTHLÓRIEN HE BLINDFOLDS THEM AND LEADS THEM TO CARAS GALADHON

ELDEN REINCARNATION DOESN'T EXACTLY WORK THE WAY YOU ARE IMAGINING IT THOUGH WHEN AN ELDEN FHA SPIRIT IS REHOUSED IT'S DONE IN ALIENOR A LAND VERY FAR AWAY FROM MIDDLE-EARTH IT'S EXCEPTIONALLY RARE FOR AN ELF TO DIE IN MIDDLE-EARTH AND THEN RETURN FROM ACROSS THE SEA AFTER BEING REINCARNATED IN THE FILM ANGUISH MAKES SENSE AS HE BEING A MAN WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE HALDI AGAIN
HIS NAME WAS HALDI ELVES DON'T JUST COME BACK HE DIED

NOTE ELVES AT DEEP IS A MOVIE ONLY THING
IN MORDOR BIG SARON EYE ORTHANT SARUMANS TOWER IN ISENGARD
ELROD NEVER LED ISILDUR TO THE CRACK OF DOOM LIKE IN THE FILMS

ISILDUR HAD A LEGITIMATE CLAIM ON THE RING AS WEREGILD FOR HIS AFTER AND BROTHER

KILLING THE KING OF AFNOR IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA THE ACT OF KILLING ISILDUR TO TAKE THE RING WOULD HAVE LIKELY CORRUPTED ELROD IN ADDITION TO STARTING A ANOTHER WAR ANYWAY

IT WAS NOT KNOWN HOW THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE WOULD SUSTAIN SARON INDEFINITELY


ANOTHER THING ISILDUR WAS A DESCENDENT THROUGH MANY GENERATIONS OF ELROD BROTHER WHO CHOSE TO BE MORTAL AND BECAME THE FOUNDING KING OF NÚMENOR
TZOLKIN DID NOT WRITE ANYTHING ABOUT THESE SORTS OF DETAILS HE WAS GENERALLY UNINTERESTED IN THE DAY-TO-DAY LIFE OF ANY RACE
I HAD NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE THIS IT'S GORGEOUS
NICE ONE
I HAVE THIS EXACT SAME EDITION I FOUND AT A SECOND HAND STORE ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE THE CASE I LOVE IT
FOR ANYONE INTERESTED
DP REF
THE RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH EDITION I GOT IT AS WELL NEVER OPENED IT SINCE I WANT IT IN PRISTINE CONDITION I GOT THE PAPERBACKS FOR MY ANNUAL

EDIT ACTUALLY I OPENED IT ONCE TO SEE THE ILLUSTRATED MAP BUT THAT'S IT
I THINK YOUR MUM WAS MY THEATRE TEACHER

THAT'S A NICE EDITION I MYSELF OWN THE ONE WITH THE BLUE SPINE AND THE ILLUSTRATIONS BY ALAN LEE
NOT WANTING SAM AND FRODO TO USE THE STAIRS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IF THE FELLOWSHIP IS INTACT IF THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP IS AROUND SHELDON ISN'T AS BIG OF AN OBSTACLE

MAYBE TZOLKIN WROTE IT IN A LETTER BUT I REALLY DO NOT THINK GANDALF THOUGHT THAT FAR AHEAD

HOWEVER IF THE FELLOWSHIP NEVER BROKE GOING THROUGH THE FRONT GATE MAY HAVE BEEN THE PLAN

POSSIBLY ROHAN FALLEN CONDOR WOULD HAVE FELT PRESSURE FROM SARON AND SAURURAN IT MAY HAVE LEFT THE FRONT GATE OPEN ENOUGH FOR THE FELLOWSHIP TO SLIP THROUGH
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED THAT TOO HE PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON TWO HOBBITS IF THEY GONE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE GATE THEY GOTTEN FUCKED
TZOLKIN NEVER TOLD US I DON'T THINK HE HAD THOUGHT IT THROUGH THAT FAR HE WAS WRITING A STORY ABOUT SMALL PEOPLE TOPPLING THE DESIGNS OF THE MIGHTY SO BY DEFINITION GANDALF COULDN'T BE THERE SINCE HE COULDN'T THERE WAS NO NEED TO COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR HIM TO WORK TOWARDS

WE CAN SPECULATE GANDALF WAS A MAIA THE SAME ORDER OF CREATION AS SARON AND THE BARONG HE WASN'T AS POWERFUL AS SARON BUT HE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT SARON HAD IN HIS TRICK BAG GANDALF HAD RESOURCES NOT AVAILABLE TO THE OTHERS SUCH AS THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE EAGLES THE OBVIOUS MOVE WAS TO GET HIMSELF AND FRODO INTO NORTHERN ITHILIEN VIA THE RIVER WELL NORTH OF MINAS MOGUL AND WITH ORODRUIN BETWEEN THEM AND THEN HAVE EAGLES FLY THEM TO THE MOUNTAIN PROTECTING AGAINST THE ONLY REAL RISK NAGUAL ATTACK SARON WOULD HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME TO BRING NAGUAL SOUTH FROM THE GATE NORTH FROM MINAS ORGUIL OR TO SEND THEM FROM THE TOWER ODDS ARE THEY COULD BE ON THE MOUNTAIN BEFORE THEY COULD BE INTERCEPTED

THE HARDEST PART WOULD BE FOR GANDALF TO ENSURE THAT FRODO GAVE UP THE RING ONCE THERE GANDALF WOULD HAVE HIS EXPERIENCE WITH BILBO TO GUIDE HIM IN THAT BUT IT WAS THE PLACE THAT THE RING WAS STRONGEST AND THAT WILL WOULD BE STRONGEST TOO ONCE HE BECAME AWARE OF THE DANGER

BUT THAT WASN'T THE STORY TZOLKIN WAS TELLING

SO REALLY GANDALF LITERALLY HAD NO PLAN
HOPEFULLY THE EAGLES
I LOVED THE FIRST TWO GAMES BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY WERE SINCE THEIR SERVERS WERE BROUGHT OFFLINE FOR BOTH CONSOLES AND PC A LONG TIME AGO I'M PRETTY SURE EA LOST THE RIGHTS TO THE GAMES TOO WHICH IS WHY IF YOU WANT TO BUY BEME 2 ON PIC YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT PAYING
I PLAYED THE FIRST BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH SO MUCH I LIKED THE SECOND ONE BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THE FIRST ONE WAS JUST GREAT I STILL PLAY IT FROM TIME TO TIME YEARS LATER I WISH THE BATTLES COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT BIGGER BUT THAT MAY BE MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME I SPENT PLAYING IT
IN THE END THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS ESSENTIALLY A STORY ABOUT DEATH
THERE ARE SO MANY AMAZING THEMES IN LOAR IF YOU WANT TO GO DEEPER INTO THE CONCEPT OF DEATH IN LEGENDARIUM READ ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF THE GIFT OF MEN MORTALITY WAS GIVEN TO MEN WHICH MADE THEM GREATLY DISTINCT FROM THE ELDAR FOR THE ELDAR WERE BOUND TO ARDA AS LONG AS IT ENDURED AND THE CONTINUAL CORRUPTION OF ARDA THROUGH THE FORCES OF EVIL AND THE DECAYING OF ALL THINGS BEAUTIFUL WAS TO THEM A GREAT GRIEF SO THE SORROW OF THE ELDAR GREW THROUGH ALL THE LONG YEARS OF MIDDLE-EARTH MEN HOWEVER ARE NOT BOUND TO ARDA AND WERE BLESSED BY ERU ILLUVATAR TO DEPART FROM THE WORLD IN SPIRIT LIKE ALL THINGS IN MIDDLE-EARTH THE POWERS OF DARKNESS TWISTED THE MINDS OF MEN TO VIEW THIS AS A DOOM RATHER THAN A GIFT AND EVENTUALLY MEN BEGAN TO FEAR MORTALITY AND VIEWED IT AS AN ENEMY

ARAGON WAS DESCENDED FROM A LONG LINE OF NUMENOREAN KINGS THROUGH WHICH WAS PRESERVED THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GIFT OF ERU AND SO AS A RESULT WELCOMED DEATH AT THE END OF HIS LONG LIFE THIS IS ESPECIALLY POIGNANT WHEN YOU CONSIDER RELIGIOUS BELIEFS THE DEATH OF ARAGON CAN BE COMPARED TO THE DEATH OF KING DAVID IN THE BIBLE FIRST CHRONICLES SAYS THAT DAVID THE SON OF JESSE REIGNED OVER ALL ISRAEL THE TIME THAT HE REIGNED OVER ISRAEL WAS FORTY YEARS HE REIGNED SEVEN YEARS IN HEBRON AND THIRTY-THREE YEARS IN JERUSALEM THEN HE DIED AT A GOOD AGE FULL OF DAYS RICHES AND HONOR AND SOLOMON HIS SON REIGNED IN HIS PLACE THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT BECAUSE OF SIN WE ALSO FEAR DEATH JUST AS MEN IN MIDDLE-EARTH DO BUT FOR THE ONE WHO TRUSTS IN GOD AND IS RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD DEATH HOLDS NO FEAR BECAUSE WE LEAVE THE WORLD FULL OF SIN AND EVIL AND GO TO BE WITH GOD DEATH FOR CHRISTIANS IS A DOORWAY TO SOMETHING BETTER I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT TZOLKIN WAS TRYING TO CONVEY THROUGH THE THEME OF DEATH AND MORTALITY IN MIDDLE-EARTH
UNLIKE THE ELVES ALL THINGS PASSIVE
WHEELER TZOLKIN

HERE'S SOMETHING MORE A FINAL UNPUBLISHED CHAPTER EPILOGUE TZOLKIN INTENDED TO PUT AFTER WELL I'M BACK
BUT ARAGON AS THE LAST OF THE NÚMENOREANS IN HIS OWN WORDS GIVES UP HIS LIFE WILLINGLY ARWEN AT LAST UNDERSTANDS WHY MEN DON'T LIKE THEIR MORTALITY SHE GOES TO CERIN AGOROTH IN LOTHLÓRIEN TO DIE THE PLACES WERE THEY PLEDGED TROTH LONG BEFORE REMEMBER WHEN THE FELLOWSHIP ARRIVES IN LOTHLÓRIEN HERE FRODO COMES TO CERIN AGOROTH THE HILL OF AGOROTH

AT THE HILL'S FOOT FRODO FOUND ARAGON STANDING STILL AND SILENT AS A
TREE BUT IN HIS HAND WAS A SMALL GOLDEN BLOOM OF ELABOR AND A LIGHT WAS IN
HIS EYES HE WAS WRAPPED IN SOME FAIR MEMORY AND AS FRODO LOOKED AT HIM HE
KNEW THAT HE BEHELD THINGS AS THEY ONCE HAD BEEN IN THIS SAME PLACE FOR THE
GRIM YEARS WERE REMOVED FROM THE FACE OF ARAGON AND HE SEEMED CLOTHED IN
WHITE A YOUNG LORD TALL AND FAIR AND HE SPOKE WORDS IN THE ELVISH TONGUE TO
ONE WHOM FRODO COULD NOT SEE VANIMELDA NAMÁRIË HE SAID AND THEN HE
DREW A BREATH AND RETURNING OUT OF HIS THOUGHT HE LOOKED AT FRODO AND SMILED

HERE IS THE HEART OF ELVENDOM ON EARTH HE SAID AND HERE MY HEART
DWELLS EVER UNLESS THERE BE A LIGHT BEYOND THE DARK ROADS THAT WE STILL MUST
TREAD YOU AND I COME WITH ME AND TAKING HAND IN HIS HE LEFT THE
HILL OF CERIN AGOROTH AND CAME THERE NEVER AGAIN AS LIVING MANUAL

IF YOU LIKED THE APPENDICES YOU MIGHT LIKE THE SILMARILLION AS WELL IT HAS THE HISTORY OF THE ANCESTORS OF ARAGON AND ARWEN AND NEAR THE END IS THE AKALLABÊTH THE STORY OF THE DOWNFALL OF NÚMENOR AND HOW THEY STRUGGLED WITH THEIR MORTALITY AND THE STORY OF ARAGON AND ARWEN IS VAGUELY SIMILAR TO THE STORY OF BEDEN AND LÚTHIEN A MORTAL AND AN ELF ARAGON TELLS A SHORT VERSION OF THEIR STORY WHEN THEY ARE AT FEATHERTOP A LONGER VERSION IS IN THE SILMARILLION

AND IF YOU READ THE SILMARILLION MAKE SURE TO READ LOAR AGAIN IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE

HOLY SHIT THAT IS AMAZING
SOME DEATH GRIPS LEVEL TATS
SOME DEATH GRIPS LEVEL TATS
AWESOME NOW BALANCE THE OTHER SIDE WITH SOME ELVISH GOODNESS
WHAT IS THE MISPRINT
GALADRIEL CATE BLANCHETT AND YES
YOU'RE REFERRING TO GALADRIEL AND SHE IS ONE OF THE THREE MIGHTIEST ELVES EVER IN ARDA THE OTHER TWO ARE HER UNCLE FËANOR AND HER COUSIN LÚTHIEN SHE WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE REBELLION AND IN ONE VERSION OF THE EVENTS SHE FOUGHT AGAINST HER UNCLE'S HOST TO DEFEND HER KINSMEN IN ALQUALONDË FROM SLAUGHTER THIS IS REALLY THE ONLY INSTANCE SHOWN OF GALADRIEL IN ACTUAL COMBAT YET IT IS POINTED OUT THAT SHE DID NOT LACK FOR COMBAT SKILLS AS SHE HAD BEEN COMPARED TO THE CAPTAINS OF GONDOLIER NOR DID SHE LACK FOR PHYSICAL SKILL ATHLETICISM AS SHE COULD COMPETE WITH THE ATHLETES OF THE ELDAR IN FACT SHE WAS KNOWN AS NEREEN SO MUCH DID SHE STAY AWAY FROM COMBAT IN MIDDLE-EARTH SHE HAD BEEN COMPARED TO MANAWA

GALADRIEL THE GREATEST OF THE ELDAR SURVIVING IN MIDDLE-EARTH WAS POTENT MAINLY IN WISDOM AND GOODNESS AS A DIRECTOR OR COUNSELLOR IN THE STRUGGLE UNCONQUERABLE IN RESISTANCE ESPECIALLY IN MIND AND SPIRIT BUT INCAPABLE OF PUNITIVE ACTION IN HER SCALE SHE HAD BECOME LIKE MANAWA WITH REGARD TO THE GREATER TOTAL ACTION THE INSTAR

HOWEVER SHE IS AN ELF AS A RULE THE AINU ARE MIGHTIER BEINGS THAN ELVES YOU MIGHT GAUGE WHAT SHE CAN BE CAPABLE OF FROM HER LESSER OR NEAR EQUAL PEERS
GALADRIEL IS POWERFUL FOR MANY REASONS SHE IS ONE OF THE FEW ELVES LEFT IN MIDDLE EARTH WHO WAS BORN IN AMAN THE CONTINENT ACROSS THE SEA WHERE THE ALAR WHO ARE A CROSS BETWEEN ARCHANGELS AND NORSE GODS AND THE MAAR LESSER ANGELIC BEINGS LIKE GANDALF SARON RADAGAST AND SAURURAN LIVE SHE IS ONE OF THE THREE OLDEST ELVES IN STILL LIVING IN MIDDLE EARTH AT THE TIME OF THE FILMS THE OTHERS BEING HER HUSBAND CELEBORN AND BIRDMAN THE SHIPWRIGHT

SHE IS ALSO OF SOME OF THE HIGHEST BLOODLINES OF ALL THE ELVES SHE IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF FANWE THE HIGH KING OF THE NOLUDAR ELVES AS SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF FINFARIN THIS MAKES HER THE NIECE OF FEASOR THE ELF WHO MADE THE SILMARILS AND ALSO THE NIECE OF FINGOLFIN THE SECOND HIGH KING OF THE NOLUDAR

ON HER MOTHER SIDE SHE WAS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF LOWE THE KING OF THE TEFERI ELVES OF AMAN WHICH MAKES HER A GREAT NIECE OF KING THINGAL OF DORIATH AND COUSIN TO LUTHIER

SO SHE IS GRANDDAUGHTER TO THE OF THE ELVES WHO AWOKE AT THE LAKE CUNIVEIN WHEN THE STARS WERE KINDLED AND WHO LED THEIR RESPECTIVE CLANS ACROSS MIDDLE EARTH TO BE TAKEN BY THE ALAR TO ALIENOR

GALADRIEL BELONGS TO THE THIRD GENERATION OF THE ELVES SHE WAS RAISED IN A PLACE THAT WAS PRACTICALLY A PARADISE AMONGST BEING OF ABILITIES EQUALING OR SURPASSING GANDALF

SHE IS ALSO THE MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER OF ARWEN AS GALADIEL AND CELEBORNS DAUGHTER CELEBESIAN WAS ELRONDS WIFE
IF YOU WANT TO ENHANCE YOUR LOAR EXPERIENCE

CONSIDER A READ OF THE SILMARILLION IT WILL HELP EXPLAIN THE ROLES AND ORIGINS OF THE ELVES WIZARDS SARON ETC

CONSIDER LISTENING TO THIS PODCAST SERIES RECORDED AT A WASHINGTON COLLEGE TZOLKIN LITERATURE COURSE IT IS EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE AND HELPS TIE THE SILMARILLION MATERIAL AND IDEAS INTO THE TEXT START HERE IDEALLY YOU READ THE PAGE SUGGESTIONS EAST G PAGES FOR THE FIRST SESSION THEN LISTEN TO SESSION IN QUESTION
HAVE A MIDDLE EARTH MAP HANDY I DIDN'T CHECK THE MAP WHEN I FIRST READ THEM WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND HAD NO CLUE WHERE ANYTHING WAS

READ SOME OF THE APPENDICES INTERESTING STUFF THERE

IF YOU REALLY LIKE LORE AND MYTHOLOGY YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY SOME OF THE EXTENDED UNIVERSE LIKE THE SILMARILLION PERSONALLY I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF IT KIND OF DULL AND AIMLESS BUT TO EACH HIS OWN
I'D SAY DO NOT SKIP THE APPENDICES PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS OF LORE YOU WILL COME ACROSS SUCH AS WITH TOM BAMBADIL ABOUT THE KINGS OF MEN IN THE NORTH OR VARIOUS NUGGETS OF GONDORIAN BELIEFS FARAMIR GIVES A HISTORY LESSON ON THE OF MEN TO FRODO PAY ATTENTION TO A SHADOW OF THE PAST AND THE PROLOGUE
YOU COULD TRY GETTING HOLD OF A COPY OF

WIKI
I LOVE THE BEGINNING OF FELLOWSHIP EVERYTHING IN THE SHIRE AND RIVENDELL

AND I ADORE THE FINALE OF RETURN OF THE KING THE EMOTION OF THE ENDING OF AN EPIC JOURNEY IS BRILLIANTLY DISPLAYED AND ALWAYS MAKES ME CRY

HOWEVER TWO TOWERS IS MY OUT AND OUT FAVOURITE ROHAN IS MY FAVOURITE PLACE IN MIDDLE EARTH AND I FEEL P GOT THE TONE OF IT ABSOLUTELY BANG ON MEDUSELD IS BEAUTIFUL THE MUSIC HOWARD SHORE CREATED FOR ROHAN IS STUNNING

I THINK ANDY SARKIS IS AT HIS BEST HERE DISPLAYING BOTH SIDES OF SMEAGOL THROUGHOUT THE FILM

THE BATTLE OF HELMS DEEP IS INCREDIBLE AND IN MY OPINION WAY BETTER THAN ANY BATTLE IN ROK

THE SACKING OF ISENGARD IS EXCELLENT AND SO THERAPEUTIC AFTER THE HELL SAURURAN HAS SPREAD THROUGHOUT FOR AND TNT

THIS FILM INTRODUCES THE ANTS WHICH IF YOU DON'T LOVE THEN YOU DON'T BELONG HERE

AND TO TOP IT OFF THIS FILM HAS THE SINGLE BEST USE OF A HELICOPTER SHOT OUTSIDE OF THE SHINING THAT SWEEPING MOUNTAIN VIEW AS PERGOLAS ARAGON AND GIMLI CHASE THE ORCS IS BOTH BREATHTAKING AND STUNNINGLY IMMERSIVE

IF I COULD ONLY EVER WATCH ONE OF THE TRILOGY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THIS ONE I JUST LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT ALSO IT DOESN'T HAVE GIANT SPIDERS WHICH IS A BIG PLUS


YEP FELLOWSHIP IS MY FAVOURITE TOO I ADORE TNT AND ROK BUT I REALLY LIKE THE TONE AND SETTING OF FELLOWSHIP AND THE INTRODUCTION TO MIDDLE-EARTH
THE SECOND ONE IS DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE THE BUILD UP TO THE BATTLE AT HELMS DEEP WAS REALLY HYPE ALTHOUGH THE SCENE IN RIVENDELL WHERE THEY'RE DISCUSSING ABOUT WHO AND HOW TO GET THE RING TO MORDOR IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES FROM THE WHOLE TRILOGY

SEEING FRODO TRYING TO SPEAK UP WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS TALKING OVER ONE ANOTHER THEN SEEING THE CHANGE IN FACIAL EXPRESSION AFTERWARDS THAT SCENE GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS EVERY TIME
FELLOWSHIP IS A

TNT AND ROK ARE BOTH
FOR ABSOLUTELY IT HAS A LOT OF THE LEVITY AND LIGHT HUMOUR PRESENT IN BOTH THE BOOK AND THE HOBBIT BOOK AND IT'S MUCH QUIETER OVERALL THE OTHER TWO FILMS ARE ABOUT EQUAL TO ME
IN THE PAST I'VE RANKED THEM FOR ROK TNT BUT THAT WAS BEFORE I SAW THE EXTENDED CUTS NOW FELLOWSHIP STILL COMES OUT AS MY FAVORITE BUT TOWERS WAS REALLY ELEVATED IN MY OPINION SO NOW I GUESS IT'S FOR ROK TNT
I THINK FELLOWSHIP I HAD NOT READ THE BOOKS BACK WHEN THE FILMS CAME OUT I HAD A ROUGH IDEA WHAT IT WAS ABOUT HAVING SPACED OUT THROUGH HALF OF THE BAKSHI CARTOON I HAD HOWEVER READ SOME DRAGONLANCE BOOKS AS A CHILD AND REALLY ENJOYED THAT KIND OF SETTING I HAD ALSO READ THE HOBBIT WHICH I THINK WAS REQUIRED READING IN LIKE GRADE FIVE SO I KNEW ABOUT BILBO AND GANDALF BUT THEY WERE DISTANT MEMORIES

SO THE MOVIE BEGINS PLAYING AND I WAS ENCHANTED BY EVERYTHING ABOUT IT THE MOOD AND IMAGERY THE MUSIC THE HOBBITS THE ANCIENT WORLD THAT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLY OLD THE ENDING WAS A REAL CLIFF HANGAR FOR ME

AFTER THAT I READ THE BOOKS READ UP ON THE LORE THE HOBBIT DISCUSSED IT AT LENGTH WITH ANYONE WHO WOULD ENGAGE ME ETC SO WHILE THE FOLLOWING FILMS WERE STILL AMAZING THEY WEREN'T AS MAGICAL FOR ME
ILL TAKE IMPOSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR

WHENEVER I TRY TO ANSWER THIS I START OUT WITH OBVIOUSLY ROK THEN AM LIKE WAIT THE FELLOWSHIP DOESN'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR BEING SO AWESOME AND SETTING THE WHOLE TONE THEN I REMEMBER THE BATTLE OF HELMS DEEP ANTS AND GIVE UP IN FRUSTRATION

IT'S REALLY A NEVER ENDING CYCLE
IT CHANGES EVERY TIME IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE NO SCENE HITS ME EVERY TIME LIKE THE RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM THOUGH BUT THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE FIRST MINUTES OF THE FELLOWSHIP IS UNPARALLELED AND THE GENERAL PACING OF THE TWO TOWERS IS THE MOST APPEALING

GOD DAMN IT HAPPENED AGAIN
FELLOWSHIP BOOMIER IS A BADASS AND THE MINES OF MORIA JOURNEY IS PERFECTION
THE ATMOSPHERE AND SENSE OF WONDER THAT FOR CREATES IS MAGNIFICENT SO IT TOPS THE OTHER TWO FOR ME
I FEEL LIKE FELLOWSHIP IS THE PERFECT FILM I THINK JACKSON WAS REALLY AT HIS PEAK AS A FILMMAKER WITH THAT ONE AND THE LIMITATIONS PUT ON HIM BEING THE FIRST OF THE TRILOGY FORCED HIM TO PERFECT THE LITTLE THINGS I ALSO JUST TEND TO PREFER THE FIRST FILMS IN TRILOGIES AND SERIES OVER THE REST
FELLOWSHIP AFTER THE COUNCIL OF ELROD IS FANTASY QUESTING AT ITS BEST
RETURN OF THE KING I LOVE THE MINAS TIGRISH AND BLACK GATES BATTLES AND I THINK THAT MOVIE HAS GANDALF AND IAN MCKELLEN AT HIS BEST
I STILL LIKE THE FELLOWSHIP BEST I MEAN I LOVE THEM ALL BUT THE OTHER TWO TAKE THEMSELVES TOO SERIOUSLY AT TIMES AND SOME OF THE CHARACTERS DEVIATE FROM THE BOOKS IN WAYS THAT MAKE NO SENSE
FELLOWSHIP HAS TO BE MY FAVORITE I ALWAYS LOVE THE MORE PROMINENT STORY CHARACTER ARCS THAT HAPPEN IN THE FIRST FILMS OF TRILOGIES LIGHT HEARTENED FUN IN THE SHIRE IN THE BEGINNING AND BY THE END THE FELLOWSHIP IS BROKEN AND FRODO IS A CHANGED HOBBIT

I ALSO REMEMBER READING SOMEWHERE THAT VIGO MORTENSEN FELT THAT THE FELLOWSHIP WAS A MASTER PIECE BUT BY THE END OF ROK HE FELT JACKSON HAD HURT THE STORY BY MAKING IT SO BATTLE CG ORIENTED
I LOVE THE BEGINNING OF THE FELLOWSHIP
THE VOICE OF GALADRIEL CATE BLANCHETT IS REALLY NICE
I ASSUME THERE IS A LOCKED DOOR SOMEWHERE AT EITHER END OF THE STAIRS ALSO ISENGARD WAS A GUARDED FORTRESS GANDALF ALSO SAYS

BUT IN THE CIRCLE OF
ISENGARD TRAPPED AND ALONE IT WAS NOT EASY TO THINK THAT THE HUNTERS BEFORE
WHOM ALL HAVE FLED OR FALLEN WOULD FALTER IN THE SHIRE FAR AWAY

GANDALF ALSO MENTIONS THAT THERE WERE WOLVES AND ORCS IN ISENGARD AND THAT SAURURAN IS BUILDING AN ARMY GANDALF IS POWERFUL BUT PROBABLY NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO FIGHT HIS WAY OUT OF A FORTRESS WITH A GREAT ARMY AND TRYING TO GET AWAY ON FOOT

I DON'T HAVE MY BOOK HERE BUT I THINK IT SAYS IN UNFINISHED TALES THAT THE WIZARDS CAME TO MIDDLE-EARTH IN THE FORM OF OLD MEN AND WERE SUBJECT TO WEARINESS AND HUNGER AND SUCH I THINK THE TOPIC OF BEING GIVEN FOOD OR NEEDING THE RESTROOM WERE JUST OMITTED FROM THE STORY WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE OTHER CHARACTERS USING THE RESTROOM EITHER AND SAURURAN KEPT GANDALF ALIVE POSSIBLY BECAUSE HE WANTED INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE RING WHICH ONLY GANDALF AND A SELECT FEW OTHERS KNEW SUCH AS ARAGON
I WILL SAY THAT IN ALMOST EVERY BOOK I'VE EVER READ THERE IS VERY LITTLE MENTION OF CHARACTERS NEEDING TO USE THE RESTROOM HOWEVER IF I WERE GANDALF I WOULD HAVE MUCH ENJOYING PISSING OVER THE SIDE OF ORTHANT AND WATCHING IT FALL FAR BELOW
A COUPLE SMALL CORRECTIONS

ELVES CAN HAVE BEARDS IT'S JUST VERY RARE BIRDMAN HAS A BEARD

AS THEY CAME TO THE GATES BIRDMAN THE SHIPWRIGHT CAME FORTH TO MEET THEM VERY TALL HE WAS AND HIS BEARD WAS LONG

THE FACT THAT TOM IS NOT AN ELF MAN HOBBIT DWARF OR ORC DOES NOT INHERENTLY MEAN THAT HE MUST BE ONE OF THE AINU THERE ARE CREATURES THAT ARE NONE OF THOSE THINGS SUCH AS UNGOLIANT


THE WHOLE TOM IS ERU THEORY IS COMPLETELY AND PROVABLY UNTRUE IT BARELY EVEN QUALIFIES AS A THEORY SINCE IT CAN BE EASILY REFUTED BY THE AUTHOR'S WRITINGS IN LETTER TZOLKIN STATES

THERE IS NO EMBODIMENT OF THE CREATOR ANYWHERE IN THIS STORY OR MYTHOLOGY

SINCE THE LEGENDARIUM WAS WRITTEN AS A MYTHIC PREHISTORY IT WOULD BE IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF HEAVY CATHOLIC BELIEFS TO HAVE ANY INCARNATION OF A GOD ON EARTH PRIOR TO THE COMING OF JESUS WHICH WOULDN'T HAPPEN FOR MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE THIRD AGE


PEOPLE IN GENERAL SEEM TO HAVE A LONG-STANDING FASCINATION WITH ELVES AND A LOVE FOR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS ARWEN IS AN ELF WHO IS IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH ARAGON HIMSELF I FOR ONE HAVE LONG BORNE A BIT OF RESENTMENT FOR ELWYN FOR TRYING TO LURE ARAGON AWAY FROM ARWEN EVEN THOUGH ROLE IN THE BOOKS IS SMALL AND SHE DIDN'T SAVE THE DAY DURING AN EPIC BATTLE I WOULD RATHER SEE ARWEN THAN ELWYN FOR ALL THESE IRRATIONAL REASONS A BADASS BUT I STILL PREFER ARWEN

PLUS YEAH LIV STAR STATUS PROBABLY INFORMS THOSE DECISIONS AS WELL
I HAVEN'T LOOKED INTO IT AT ALL BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT TALES OF MIDDLE EARTH IS
R LORDOFTHERINGSRP HERE'S A LINK IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT
AFTER BEING A FAN OF TZOLKIN SINCE AGE TWELVE AND OWNING THE SOUNDTRACKS OF ALL THE LOAR FILMS AND UNEXPECTED JOURNEY I ONLY RECENTLY DISCOVERED THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE COMPLETE RECORDINGS THE FELLOWSHIP ALBUM HAS AN ENTIRE TRACK OF THE ELVES SINGING A ELBERETH GILTHONIEL WHAT MORE CAN I SAY
DELETED
UPDATE

MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE

THE HOBBIT

ED SHEERAN I SEE FIRE

SONG OF THE LONELY MOUNTAIN PERFORMED BY NEIL FINN


LORD OF THE RINGS

LOTHLORIEN

MAY IT BE ANYA

THE COUNCIL OF ELROD ANYA

THIS IS PRETTY COOL DID YOU CREATE THE ENTIRE THING OR DID YOU TAKE ART AND PUT THE LOGO ON IT
YOUR UNIVERSITY MUST BE FUN IF IT'S LIKE MORDOR
AWESOME
JUST A VERY VERY SLIGHT CRITICISM IF I MAY I THINK EVERYTHING LOOKS AWESOME THE LANDSCAPE MT DOOM THE CONTRASTS BETWEEN EVERYTHING BUT THE EYE WITH THE HALF MOON IN IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS RANDOMLY SLAPPED RIGHT UP IN THERE VERY CARTOONIST AND RANDOM IN THE SCHEME OF THE REST OF THE COVER OTHERWISE I THINK IT'S VERY COOL

ALSO I'M NO ARTIST SO THIS IS JUST A RANDOM PERSON GIVING INPUT I COULD BE WAY OFFICIAL
I MEAN NO OFFENSE AM NOT POKING FUN AT THE SERIOUS CONTENT OF THE ARTICLE MORE AT MY OWN THOUGHT PROCESSES
I READ THE HEADLINE AND COULD ONLY PICTURE A PISSED-OFF NAZGÛL CHECKING ITS WRISTWATCH STANDING ON THE SIDE OF A CITY STREET
THEN OH OOPS
LAO SAME SHOULDN'T HAVE CARELESSLY LOST THEIR RIDES IN THE BRUCINE
HAHA I THOUGHT THE SAME TOO EVEN AFTER I SAW YOUR TITLE ABOUT RACE I GUESS THE PHRASE BLACK RIDERS IS JUST TRIGGERING TO LOAR FANS
FOOL NO MAN CAN DRIVE ME
SARON IS A MORE POWERFUL ANGEL

SAURURAN SERVING SARON IS A MOVIE THING IN THE BOOKS IT IS MORE OF A FEIGNED ALLEGIANCE SAURURAN HAS HIS OWN GOALS CLAIMING THE RING FOR HIMSELF
SARON WAS VERY VERY POWERFUL ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST OF THE MAAR TO EXIST SAURURAN WAS POWERFUL HIMSELF AS THE HEAD OF THE INSTAR BUT HE COULDN'T COMPARE TO SARON AND HE KNEW IT
YOU'VE CLEARLY NOT READ THE BOOKS I'D SUGGEST STARTING THERE
SAURURAN NEVER INTENDED TO HELP SARON HE ALWAYS EVER WANTED THE RING FOR HIMSELF THIS GOES WAY BACK IN UT THERE IS A POWERFUL SCENE WHERE SAURURAN IS MEETING WITH THE WHITE COUNCIL AND THERE IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT LOVE OF THE HOBBITS SAURURAN PARANOID OF OWN DESIRE FOR THE RING FOR HIMSELF SAURURAN THOUGHT GANDALF HAD THE SAME DARK AMBITIONS MAKES A SNIDE REMARK ABOUT GANDALF AND HIS LOVE OF THE HOBBITS RESPONSE WAS TO BLOW A SERIES OF SMOKE RINGS FROM HIS PIPE AND THEN WAVE HIS HAND THROUGH THEM AS IF TRYING TO GRASP IT WAS AN IMAGE THAT TOLD SAURURAN YOU WILL NEVER HAVE WHAT YOU WANT ASSISTANCE TO SARON WAS NEVER THAT AND BOTH HE AND SARON KNEW IT BUT SARON WAS WILLING TO LET SAURURAN PLAY HIS PART AS HE WAS ABLE TO WEAKEN THE ALLIED ARMIES AND SARON WAS ALWAYS PLAYING PEOPLE TO HIS OWN ENDS AND FOR HIMSELF WE SEE THIS WITH GOLLUM EVEN SHELDON EACH HAD THEIR PART IN HIS GREATER PLAN
SAURURAN WAS NEVER A TRUE ALLY OF SARON HIS MISSION WAS TO DEFEAT HIM BY MOTIVATING THE FREE PEOPLES OF MIDDLE-EARTH SAME AS GANDALF BUT SAURURAN ABANDONED THAT AND WANTED THE RING FOR HIMSELF IN THE BOOK HE IS CALLED A DOUBLE TRAITOR AS HE IS BOTH A TRAITOR TO THE GOOD GUYS AS WELL AS TO SARON HE SENDS HIS ORCS TO TAKE THE HOBBITS IN THIS CASE JUST MERRY AND PIPPIN TO ISENGARD IN THE HOPE THAT ONE OF THEM CARRIES THE RING

AND I'M NOT SURE HE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN GANDALF GANDALF THE WHITE AT LEAST SAYS THAT HE HIMSELF IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PERSON IN MIDDLE-EARTH AFTER SARON
POWER HE THOUGHT SARON WAS GOING TO WIN AND THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER TO ALLY HIMSELF
IT'S GANDALF
PERHAPS SAURURAN CHANGES HIS WHITE ROBE FOR ONE THAT CHANGES COLOURS AND HE CALLS HIMSELF SAURURAN OF MANY COLOURS
MAYBE BUT HE DIDN'T
HE CHANGED TO WHITE
WELL IF WE HELP YOU THAT WOULD BE CHEATING
NOW I REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT SAYS

IS THIS MORE PETER BULLSHIT ALONG THE LINES OF THE WITCH KING MAKING GANDALF HIS BITCH

PROBABLY WE KNOW THERE WAS SOME SORT OF RAID BY THE WHITE COUNCIL TO DOL GOLDER BUT SARON EXPECTED IT AND ESCAPED TO MORDOR THERE WERE PROBABLY NO RINGWRAITHS THERE AS GANDALF WAS COMPLETELY TAKEN BY SURPRISE DURING FELLOWSHIP WHEN HE LEARNS THE RINGWRAITHS HAVE RETURNED
DON'T TRY TO LOOK FOR ANY SORT OF LOGICAL CONSISTENCY OR FAITHFULNESS TO LORE IN THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES YOU WON'T FIND ANY
I MAY ALSO BE A BIT OF FORESHADOWING BOOMIER DIES TRYING TO SAVE MERRY AND PIPPIN
I THINK YOUR ARE THINKING TOO MUCH ON IT BOOMIER WAS JUST NEAR MERRY AND PIPPIN AND THUS TRIED TO HIDE THEM ARAGON WAS NEAR FRODO AND SAME SITUATION BOOMIER WAS AS DUTIFUL AS ANY MAN IN ME AND WOULD DO ANYTHING TO SAVE HIS COUNTRY
THEY WEAR THEM BECAUSE SARON DOES NOT POSSESS THE ONE BESIDES SHOULD HE EVER GET IT THEY WOULD STILL BE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THE WORK THAT WAS DONE WITH THEM WOULD BE KNOWN TO HIM PERGOLAS DESCRIBES TIME FOR THE ELVES

THE WORLD MOVES AND IT MOVES BOTH VERY SWIFT AND VERY SLOW SWIFT BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES CHANGE LITTLE AND ALL ELSE FLEETS BY IT IS A GRIEF TO THEM SLOW BECAUSE THEY NEED NOT COUNT THE RUNNING YEARS NOT FOR THEMSELVES THE PASSING SEASONS ARE BUT RIPPLES EVER REPEATED IN THE LONG LONG STREAM THE GREAT RIVER

DEALING WITH THE WANING IN MIDDLE-EARTH WAS A PRIMARY REASON FOR THE CREATION OF THE RINGS THIS IS SEEN IN BOTH RIVENDELL TIME DOESN'T SEEM TO PASS HERE IT JUST IS A REMARKABLE PLACE ALL TOGETHER MANY MEETINGS AND IN LOTHLÓRIEN

IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD STEPPED OVER A BRIDGE OF TIME INTO A CORNER OF THE ELDER DAYS AND WAS NOW WALKING IN A WORLD THAT WAS NO MORE IN RIVENDELL THERE WAS MEMORY OF ANCIENT THINGS IN LORIEN THE ANCIENT THINGS STILL LIVED ON IN THE WAKING WORLD LOTHLÓRIEN
SO ONE THING THAT HAS ALWAYS CONFUSED ME ABOUT THE ELDEN RINGS OF POWER IS THAT IF SARON EVER RECOVERS THE ONE RING HE WILL BE ABLE TO DOMINATE THE THREE RINGS SO WHY THE HELL ARE THEY STILL WEARING THEM

BECAUSE THEY CAN JUST TAKE THEM OFF IF THAT HAPPENS SAME AS THEY DID THE FIRST TIME THE THREE'S TRUE PURPOSE IS PRESERVATION AND WISDOM SARON DIDN'T OVERSEE THEIR MAKING
THE THREE RINGS THEY POSSESSED HAD USEFUL POWERS SUCH AS PRESERVING THE BEAUTY OF THE AREAS IN WHICH THE ELVES LIVED AND SARON HAD NEVER ACTUALLY TOUCHED THE THREE AND IF THE ONE RING WAS CAPTURED THEY WOULD THEN HAVE TAKEN THEM OFF FOR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE THROUGH THE RINGS CONNECTIONS
THE ELVES DO KNOW WHERE THE RINGS CAME FROM SINCE THEY CRAFTED THEM THEMSELVES THEY HAVE ALSO TAKEN THEM OFF BEFORE WHEN SARON FIRST PUT ON HIS ONE RING THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY AWARE THAT HURON WOULD DOMINATE THEM THUS THEY TOOK OFF THE RINGS

ONLY WHEN SARON LOST HIS RING DID THEY PUT THE RINGS BACK ON
LOTHLORIEN AND RIVENDELL EXISTED BECAUSE GALADRIEL AND ELROD USED THEIR RINGS TO PRESERVE THOSE PLACES AND EMPOWER THEM
THE RINGS WERE CREATED BY THE ELDEN SMITH UNBEKNOWNST TO SARON HE WOULD NOT HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER THE ELF LORDS AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THEIR RINGS OFFICIAL
IN THE BOOK MERRY AND PIPPIN ARE HELPING FRODO MOVE AND HE THINKS HE WILL SLIP SECRETLY AWAY WITH ONLY SAM AS A COMPANION IN REALITY ALL HIS FRIENDS MERRY PIPPIN SAM FATTY ARE CONSPIRING TO HELP HIM ON HIS QUEST WHICH THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT FROM EAVESDROPPING

IN THE FILM AT LEAST REMEMBER THAT MERRY AND PIPPIN ARE CLOSE FRIENDS AND HIS RELATIVES GOOD LOYAL FRIENDS WHO SEE FRODO IS IN DANGER AND NEEDS HELP

YOU CAN TRUST US TO STICK TO YOU THROUGH THICK AND THIN TO THE BITTER END AND YOU CAN TRUST US TO KEEP ANY SECRET OF YOURS CLOSER THAN YOU KEEP IT YOURSELF BUT YOU CANNOT TRUST US TO LET YOU FACE TROUBLE ALONE AND GO OFF WITHOUT A WORD WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS MERRY
ALSO IN THE BOOKS MERRY AND PIPPIN ARE IN FACT COUSINS AND PROBABLY THE COUSINS HE HAS THE CLOSEST RELATIONSHIP WITH OUTSIDE OF BILBO WHO IS ACTUALLY A COUSIN NOT AN UNCLE ESPECIALLY MERRY AS FRODO LIVED IN BUCKLAND WITH THE BRANDYBUCKS FOR AWHILE BETWEEN THE TIME HIS PARENTS DIED AND BILBO TOOK HIM IN MOTHER WAS A YOUNGER SISTER OF GRANDFATHER MAKING FRODO AND DAD CARADOC FIRST COUSINS AND FRODO AND MERRY FIRST COUSINS ONCE REMOVED

FRODO MERRY AND PIPPIN ARE RELATED IN MULTIPLE WAYS THEY ALL ARE DESCENDANTS OF THE OLD TOOK AS IS BILBO
DON'T FORGET THAT IN THE BOOK THERE WAS A SPACE OF MANY YEARS BETWEEN BIRTHDAY PARTY AND FRODO LEAVING THE SHIRE THEY WERE ALL IN ON IT IT WAS ALL WELL KNOWN TO HIS FRIENDS BY THE TIME OF HIS LEAVING
THEY JUST ADDED THIS DETAIL TO THE MOVIES TO MAKE IT SIMPLER IN THE BOOKS MERRY AND PIPPIN INSISTED ON GOING WITH FRODO WHILE HE WAS PLANNING TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY EVER INTENDED TO GO PAST BREE BUT THEY KIND OF GOT CAUGHT UP IN EVERYTHING AND ENDED UP IN RIVINDELL
YEAH I RECKON THEY CHANGED IT TO PLAY UP M P'S RELATIVE IMMATURITY AND TENDENCY TO MISCHIEF AND PROBABLY TO AVOID SOME INFODUMPING IN THE BOOK IT'S HANDLED MUCH BETTER SAM MERRY AND PIPPIN KNOW IN ADVANCE THAT LEAVING BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN KEEPING TABS ON HIM FOR A WHILE
MORE REASONS WHY THE FILMS ACTUALLY CAUSE PEOPLE TO KNOW LESS ABOUT THE BOOK THAN IF THEY'D NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN THEM
BASED SOLELY ON THE APPEARANCE I BELIEVE THOSE BARS TASTE EITHER INCREDIBLY GOOD OR UTTERLY DISGUSTING
HIGH CALORIE STOMACH CEMENT
CAN CONFIRM REFERRED TO THIS AS BEMBAS WHEN WE GOT IT IN OUR DORM EMERGENCY KITS WORKS GREAT FOR HIKES AND IT DOESN'T TASTE AWFUL
THIS REMINDS ME OF METAL GEAR SOLID
NICE PERSONALLY I ALWAYS THOUGHT BEMBAS WOULD TASTE LIKE A CHEESE DANISH
PRETTY TASTY
I'D RATHER JUST MAKE MY OWN TSH
DID YOU JUST WATCH THE RECENT ASHEN
COULD ONE LIVE OFF OF THESE THINGS EXCLUSIVELY COULD THIS ON A REGIMENTED DIET APPROPRIATE FOR ONE'S STATURE HEALTH ETC COULD BE A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF NUTRITION
HEY I LIVE IN ABINGTON IF YOU GET THE BREAD WANNA GO ON AN ADVENTURE
PROBABLY MORE LIKE THAT STUFF GIMLI BOOMIER CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH THOUGHT BEMBAS BREAD WAS
I THINK I WOULD RATHER EAT LAMBDAS
DELETED
MAYBE SHE MEANS NEXT FANTASY EPIC HE'S WRITING PRODUCING AN ADAPTATION OF THE MORTAL ENGINES AND WELL AS A DAMBUSTERS FILM WHICH HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT FOR A WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE HE'S GOING BACK TO THE MINIATURES ROUTE ON THOSE AFTER CRITICISM FOR THE EXCESSIVE CGI IN THE HOBBIT OR FOR BUDGETARY REASONS

JACKSON AND CO HAVE THE RIGHTS TO ALL THE MATERIAL IN THE HOBBIT AND LOAR SO THEY COULD DO SPIN OFF FILMS OR MAKE UP THEIR OWN STORIES SET IN THE TIMELINES I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS THE REFERENCE TO ARAGON IN TBOTFA WAS A TEASE TOWARDS A SPIN OFF FILM BUT I THINK THE TZOLKIN ESTATE AND THE CURRENT OWNERS OF THE FILM RIGHTS ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A LAWSUIT WITH EACH OTHER WHICH MIGHT STOP ANY DEVELOPMENT ON FUTURE FILMS
I HEARD THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT DOING SOMETHING WITH THE SILMARILLION BUT THAT IT ENDED UP BEING SCRAPPED DUE TO RIGHTS OR SOMETHING IF THEY ARE WORKING ON MAKING PLANS FOR ANOTHER ADAPTATION INTO A MOVIE OR A SERIES IT WILL BE THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD I HOPE SOMEONE KNOWS MORE THAN ME ABOUT THIS
DOMINATION OF THE THREE ELDEN RINGS AND DOMINATION OF OTHER MINDS THE SAME THING IT DOES FOR SARON
THE GREY OR THE WHITE
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE RING WOULD BETRAY HIM FOR IT HAS ONLY ONE MANTEE
YOU SHOULD PLAY THIRD AGE TOTAL WAR IN THAT GAME THE FOUNTAIN GUARDS ARE AWESOME
SHIELDS UP TOWER GAUDS
WAR

DON'T CARE GOTTA GUARD THE TREE
IN THE BOOKS THEY'D BE BADASSES MOST OF THE HUMAN WARRIORS WERE IN THE MOVIES THEY'D RUN AROUND FLAPPING THEIR ARMS SCREAMING LIKE SEVEN YEAR OLD GIRLS THAT WAS ONE OF MY BIGGEST PET PEEVES ABOUT THE MOVIES I STILL LOVED THEM THOUGH
BEME THEY DESTROY TROLLS
WHAT WHO IS IT
I REALLY LOVE READING THE LORE BEHIND MIDDLE-EARTH I RECENTLY READ OF QUOR AND HIS COMING TO GONDOLIER IN UNFINISHED TALES FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT WAS REALLY COOL TO SEE WHY THE LIVERY OF THE FOUNTAIN GUARDS FEATURED WINGED HELMS OF SEA BIRDS THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF HISTORY GOES INTO A SINGLE HELM
I WOULD IMAGINE THEY ARE LIKE THE MARINES STATIONED AT THE WHITE HOUSE OR THE BUCKINGHAM PALACE GUARDS THE UNIFORMS THEY WEAR ARE CEREMONIAL MORE THAN FUNCTIONAL
CONSIDERING THEY'RE BACKGROUND CHARACTERS THEY'D DIE JUST AS EASILY AS GOBLINS HAHA
THIS COULD BE ON R SHITTYASKSCIENCE WHAT KIND OF BIRD IS THIS
HOLY SHIT THIS POST IS GARBAGE LIKE WHAT DO WE EVEN HAVE MODS FOR IF SHIT LIKE THIS STAYS UP
YOU WILL RUN AFOUL OF THE TZOLKIN ESTATE IF YOU DO THIS ESPECIALLY IF PATRON IS INVOLVED THEY MAY TURN A BLIND EYE TO MOST FAN WORK BUT WHEN MONEY IS INVOLVED IT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER ALSO THEY STILL HOLD ALL RIGHTS TO THE SILMARILLION AND THEY TAKE THEM VERY SERIOUSLY

AS IT STANDS YOUR INITIAL COMICS ARE UNLIKELY TO CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS BUT TRYING TO GET MONEY FOR THEM IS A BIG NO-NO
HEY ASHLEY WE DISCUSSED THE LICENSING ISSUES OVER ON R TOLKIENFANS DID YOU DECIDE TO RISK IT

R TOLKIENFANS COMMENTS ST IBM SH
THE ELVES MADE ALL THE RINGS FOR THEMSELVES WITH HELP CELEBRIMBOR MADE ALONE AND IN SECRET

WHEN SARON MADE THE ONE RING THE ELVES TOOK OFF ALL OTHER RINGS OR ELSE BE CONTROLLED BY SARON SARON WAGED WAR AGAINST THEM CAPTURING THE AFTER TORTURING CELEBRIMBOR FOR THE INFORMATION HE THEN GAVE TO DWARVES AND TO MEN IN THE HOPES OF DOMINATING THEM INSTEAD THE THREE REMAINED SECRET AND WERE NOT CAPTURED BY SARON
THE ELVES MADE THE RINGS THEMSELVES WITH THE HELP OF SARON CELEBRIMBOR WAS THE LEADER OF THE ELVES OF REGION HOLLIN THE AREA WEST OF MORIA ABOUT THE AREA THE FELLOWSHIP TRAVELS BEFORE THEY GET TO MORIA THERE ARE GREAT RINGS

WERE MADE BY THE ELVES AND SARON TOGETHER

THE THREE RINGS OF THE ELVES WERE MADE BY CELEBRIMBOR IN SECRET WITHOUT HELP BUT USING HIS TEACHINGS IT'S MADE CLEAR THAT SARON NEVER TOUCHED THEM THINGS WENT SOUR WHEN SARON MADE THE ONE RING AND THE ELEVS WERE AWARE OF HIM AND TOOK OFF THEIR THREE RINGS AND SARON INVADED REGION THE ELVES MANAGED TO HIDE THE THREE AND THEY ENDED UP ULTIMATELY WITH ELROD GALADRIEL AND CHURDAN WHO GAVE HIS TO GANDALF SARON TOOK THE RINGS FROM THE ELVES AND DISTRIBUTED THEM FOR THE DWARVES FOR MEN WHO BECAME THE RINGWRAITHS THE SURVIVORS OF REGION WENT ON TO FOUND THE HIDDEN HOME OF RIVENDELL UNDER ELROD

SO THE ELVES DIDN'T RECEIVE THE TREE SARON NEVER POSSESSED THEM SARON ALSO REGAINED A BUNCH OF THE DWARF RINGS AS THE DWARVES WERE NOT EASILY CORRUPTED AND SINCE HE LOST THE ONE RING HE CONTROLLED THE RINGWRAITHS BY KEEPING THEIR NINE RINGS HIMSELF
CELEBRIMBOR MADE THE THREE RINGS WITH THE TEACHINGS OF ANNATAR SARON

THE OTHER RINGS WERE MADE BY SARON AND WERE ALL MADE FOR THE ELVES BUT WHEN SARON PUT ON THE ONE THEY PERCEIVED HIM AND HIS EVIL INTENT

SARON THEN FOUGHT TO REGAIN THE RINGS AND DISTRIBUTED THEM TO MEN AND DWARVES
THE ELVES KEPT THE THREE BECAUSE THEY WERE THE MOST POWERFUL RINGS THEY MADE AND WERE VERY USEFUL IN DEALING WITH FADING IN MIDDLE-EARTH ALL OF THE OTHER RINGS OF POWER WERE ACTUALLY ELDEN RINGS TOO IT WAS SARON WHO SPREAD THEM OUT AMONG VARIOUS PEOPLE THE DWARVES GOT AND MEN AT THE END SARON HELD OF THE AND ALL OF THE AND FRODO HAD THE ONE REGION HAD BEEN SACKED BY SARON WHO WANTED ALL OF THE RINGS THE ELVES HAD HIDDEN THE THREE WITH BIRDMAN AND GALADRIEL
IT WON'T MAKE TOO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE MOSTLY JUST PRICE AND BOX ARTICLE I'D SUGGEST WARNING HIM ABOUT THE PACING OF THE BOOKS THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIES THE FIRST HALF OF FELLOWSHIP IN PARTICULAR HAS A LOT OF THEY WALKED AROUND A HILL AND OVER A STREAM BUT IT STILL HAS A LOT OF BRILLIANCE THE MOVIES DIDN'T ADD
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE BOX SET OF HARDCOVERS IS THEY ARE HEAVY TO HOLD AND BECAUSE THEY ARE SO NICE YOUR BROTHER MAY NOT WANT TO TAKE THEM EVERYWHERE I RECOMMEND GOING TO A NICE BOOKSTORE AND SEEING WHAT THEY HAVE
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT THOSE WERE THEY LOOK VAGUELY CHINESE BUT THEY ARE IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM FROM TZOLKIN OR ANY WORK I'VE EVER SEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIM OR WHAT THEY SUPPOSEDLY STAND FOR I THINK SOMEONE'S PULLING YOUR LEGEND
ITS LOOKS LIKE A KIND OF STYLIZED REPRESENTATION OF THE SYMBOLS FROM THE MAPS OF LOAR WITH THE ONE ON THE LEFT BEING CLOSEST TO THE LOOK OF MINAS TIGRISH AND THE INSPIRATION FOR THE OTHERS BEING DRAWN FROM THE VARIED INDICATORS ON THE MAPS THEMSELVES BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW THEY HAVE NO ACTUAL BASIS IN ANY OF WORKS
RANDALL ALSO SNUCK THE SHIRE AND MINAS TIGRISH ON THERE
MINAS TIGRISH REPORTING IN IT'S CLOUDY AS BALLS AND I MISSED SHE SUPERMOON
SURELY HOGSMEADE IS IN THE NORTH MAYBE EVEN IN SCOTLAND
AND THE DISCORD OF MELIOR WAS DAUBSTER IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW
EVERYBODY IN CHESTER TO THE LIMIT
I WISH THIS WERE TRUE I'D LIVE IN MINAS TIGRISH WELL CORBAN REALLY BUT IT'S NOT FAR I'D MOVE
WELP APPARENTLY I LIVE IN TARP NOW
HIDDEN POKÉMON HAHA
THAMES MADE ME SNORT
WHAT IS THE PROTRACTOR FOR
SO I HAVE FAMILY IN DOBBY AND MY FROM GLUTENFREE
I'M REALLY SURPRISED TO SEE BRAINTREE ON THERE ONE OF THE FEW REAL PLACES ON IT
GLUTENFREE IS THE ONE THAT GOT ME
I'M SITTING AT MY DESK GUFFAWING AT THIS I WOULD UNVOTE IT INFINITELY IF I COULD

TWO REFERENCES TO PETER FRAMPTON NICE
AWESOME MY DAD KEPT WARNING ME THAT I MIGHT GET BORED WITH IT BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS FANTASTIC THERE WAS ONLY ONE PART THAT WAS HARD TO GET THROUGH AND THAT WAS THE CHAPTER DESCRIBING THE LANDSCAPE OF BELERIAND I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DID
GOOD STUFF QUANTA SILMARILLION IS WHEN IT REALLY GETS GOOD I TRIED TWICE TO GET THROUGH VALAQUENTA AND FAILED I FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING THE THIRD TIME FOR SOME REASON THERE ARE SOME PARTS THAT DRAG A BIT OF BELERIAND AND IT'S REALMS WAS ONE OF THOSE FOR ME
IF YOU GOT THROUGH THE VALAQUENTA THEN YOURE PROBABLY GOING TO ENJOY ALL THE REST IN MY OPINION THE BOOK JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER THE FARTHER YOU GET INTO IT
DID YOU NOTICE THE SHORT PARAGRAPH ABOUT GANDALF IN THE VALAQUENTA HE WAS KNOWN AS OLÓRIN BACK THEN MENTIONED IN OF THE MAAR
DELETED
AWESOME I'M SLOWLY BUILDING SOMETHING SIMILAR NEVER TOO MUCH LOAR STUFF
I HAVE THE BLUE LOAR RISK BOARDGAME WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE RED ONE
SHORT ANSWER WE HAVE NO IDEA

SLIGHTLY LONGER ANSWER ARAGON SAYS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT GANDALF DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN AND THAT AT SOME POINT THINGS WOULD BE LEFT UP TO FRODO TO DECIDE
PRETTY MUCH IF PIPPIN POOR FOOL OF A TOOK DIDN'T KNOCK THAT BUCKET INTO THE WELL NO GOBLINS NO BARONG GIANT EAGLES
IN THE BOOKS AND MOVIES FRODO IN THE MOVIE FARIMIR IN THE BOOKS POINTED OUT THAT

WHAT
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE GANDALF HAD ONLY THOUGHT OF HOW TO AVOID SAURURAN AND WAS PLANNING ON IMPROVISING OR LEAVING IT UP TO THE FELLOWSHIP TO CHOOSE THEIR ROAD AFTER THE MISTY MOUNTAINS PRIOR TO THE MISTY MOUNTAINS SAURURAN WAS THE GREATEST THREAT TO THE QUEST AND EVEN THEN HE ULTIMATELY LEFT THE DECISION UP TO FRODO TO CHOOSE MORIA ROLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST SARON WAS TO BE A MOTIVATING FORCE AND ONE WHO INSPIRES MEN TO STAND AGAINST THE SHADOW HE BORE THE ELDEN RING ANARYA WHICH HAD THE ABILITY TO INSPIRE OTHERS AND TO RESIST TYRANNY AND DESPAIR IT WASN'T UNTIL HIS RETURN AS GANDALF THE WHITE THAT HE WAS ALLOWED TO DIRECTLY FIGHT AGAINST SARON
THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY THE LONG WAY ROUND BUT AT LEAST FRODO AND SAM DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SUPPLIES TO MAKE IT
FLY YOU FOOLS
BY EAGLE OF COURSE LOL K
THE LOAR MOVIES ARE SIMPLY A BETTER INTRODUCTION TO MIDDLE EARTH IMO

THEY'RE ALSO BETTER MOVIES IN GENERAL
WELL FOR STARTERS THEY'RE JUST NOT GREAT I PERSONALLY WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND SOMEONE WATCH THEM FIRST BECAUSE I FEEL THEY MIGHT LEAVE A BAD TASTE IN THEIR MOUTH THINK OF THE STAR WARS PREQUEL

SPEAKING MORE OBJECTIVELY THEY ARE MADE WITH THE IDEA THAT THE VIEWER IS FAMILIAR WITH THE BASIC SETTING AND CERTAIN MAJOR CHARACTERS WITHOUT CONTEXT THE WEIGHT OF CERTAIN SCENES IS LOST AND MIGHT LEAD TO SOME HEAD SCRATCHING

LOAR ON THE OTHER HAND STARTS WITH THIS IS A WEIRD FANTASY STORY HERE'S WHAT'S UP WHY YOU SHOULD CARE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT IT
I'M GOING TO PUT A DISSENTING OPINION AND SAY I ACTUALLY REALLY ENJOYED THE HOBBIT MOVIES EXTENDED EDITIONS THAT IS THEATRICAL WERE NOT SO GREAT

THAT SAID I STILL RECOMMEND WATCHING LOAR FILMS FIRST BECAUSE AS SOME OTHERS HAVE SAID IT PROVIDES A BETTER INTRODUCTION TO MIDDLE EARTH

ON A SIDE NOTE I THINK THE IDEAL ORDER IS FELLOWSHIP HOBBIT TRILOGY TWO TOWERS AND ROK INTRODUCED MY F TO THEM THIS WAY AND IT WAS FANTASTIC
LOT OF ODD HATE FOR THE HOBBIT HERE SOME STATING IT HAS A DIFFERENT FEEL THAN THE TRILOGY WELL NO DUH THEY READ QUITE DIFFERENTLY TOO
JUST DONT WATCH THE HOBBIT

ITS SUPPOSE TO BE A CHILDREN STORY WITH TALKING ANIMALS AND JOLLY DWARVES BUT WHAT THEY DID TO THE MOVIE WAS
THEY'RE TRASH
I WOULD WATCH THE HOBBIT FIRST BECAUSE THEN U STILL HAVE THE LOAR IF YOU DO IT IN REVERSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A TERRIBLE TASTE IN UR MOUTH WHEN U FINISH THE LAST HOBBIT FILM
DELETED
I AND MANY OTHERS CAN GIVE YOU A MYRIAD OF REASONS TO NOT WATCH THE HOBBIT AT ALL ATLEAST NOT WITHOUT READING THE BOOK FIRST SO YOU CAN MAKE SOME SENSE OF WHAT P WAS ATTEMPTING
IT WOULD ALSO BE INTERESTING TO COMPARE EACH SUB STORIES PERCENTAGE OF THE WHOLE STORY IN THE MOVIE AS COMPARED TO THE BOOK SAY INSTEAD OF COUNTING MINUTES OUT OF THE TOTAL TIME COUNT PAGES OUT OF THE TOTAL BOOK AND SEE HOW THEY COMPARE YOU'D BE ABLE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT TZOLKIN AND THE CREATORS OF THE FILM THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT OR WHAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE FILM MAKING ASPECT I ALSO THOUGHT THE SCENE FORESHADOWING THE USE OF THE DRAIN TO BREAK THE WALL OF DEEP WAS PRETTY GOOD TOO
HE WAS WHEN HE DIED AND WAS A DÚNEDAIN THE DÚNEDAIN WERE DESCENDANTS OF THE NUMENOREANS WHO HAD THE LIFESPAN OF TIMES THAT OF A NORMAL MEN KING ELROD LIVED TO AND HIS LINEAGE ALSO HAD A LONGER LIFESPAN OF THE AVERAGE NUMENOREAN WHILE A VERY VERY DISTANT RELATIVE OF ELROD ARAGON IS STILL PART OF THAT LINEAGE

EDIT NOT ALL MEN ARE DESCENDED FROM NUMENOREANS ARARGORN SERVED KING HENGEL OF ROHAN FATHER WHILE THEOWMEN WAS A CHILD
THE KINGS OF NOUMENON HAD A LITTLE BIT OF ELVISH BLOOD IN THEM IT BEGAN WHEN THE BROTHERS ELROD AND ELROD WERE GIVEN THE CHOICE OF WHETHER TO LIVE AS MEN OR ELVES AT THE END OF THE FIRST AGE ELROD CHOSE ELF ELROD CHOSE MANUAL THE DESCENDENTS OF ELROD BECAME THE KINGS OF NOUMENON AND LATER THE KINGS OF CONDOR AND AFNOR THEY WERE MORTAL BUT THEIR LIFESPANS WERE GREATER THAN NORMAL MEN
ARAGON WAS YOUNGER BY A YEAR THAN DENETHOR IN LOAR BUT BOTH ARE KINSMEN THE MEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT HAVE ACTUALLY DIMINISHED MUCH AS A PEOPLE IN BOTH NUMBERS AND IN THEIR INHERENT ABILITIES LATE IN THE THIRD AGE THESE GUYS ARE KNOWN AS KINGS OF MEN OR MEN OF THE WEST WHICH IS THE SAME AS DÚNEDAIN OR NÚMENÓREANS AT THE TIME OF LOAR THE DÚNEDAIN ARE GENERALLY LIVING TO AROUND YEARS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER DIED AT YEARS OF AGE THE HOUSE OF THE KINGS ARE LONGER LIVED AND TENDED TO BE SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER DÚNEDAIN IN VIGOUR OR ABILITY ALDARION AND BRENDIS NOTE FOR EXAMPLE ANCESTORS HIS FATHER WAS KILLED WHEN HE WAS YOUNG TENDED TO LIVE AROUND WHILE THEY WERE KINGS IN EXILE HOWEVER IN THE SOUTH THE LAST PERSON TO LIVE TO WAS THE 7TH RULING STEWARD ADOR

THE DÚNEDAIN OR NÚMENÓREANS WERE DAIN WHO WERE GIVEN THE GIFT OF NÚMENOR OR WESTERNESSE FOR THEIR STRUGGLES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE DARK LORD MORGOTH IN THE NORTH IN BELERIAND

AS A REWARD FOR THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE CAUSE AGAINST MORGOTH THE ALAR THE GUARDIANS OF THE WORLD GRANTED TO THE DAIN A LAND TO DWELL IN REMOVED FROM THE DANGERS OF MIDDLE-EARTH APPENDIX A NÚMENOR

THEIR FIRST KING ELROD WAS AND THE BROTHER OF ELROD HE LIVED FOR YEARS AND HIS DESCENDANTS LIVED FOR AROUND YEARS HIS DESCENDANTS WERE DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER DÚNEDAIN IN THEIR GREATER LIFESPAN AND ABILITIES AS I MENTIONED ALREADY BRENDIS REMARKS ON THESE PARTICULAR DÚNEDAIN TO HER DAUGHTER THE FUTURE FIRST RULING QUEEN OF NÚMENOR ANCALIMË

MEN IN NÚMENOR ARE SAID BRENDIS ESPECIALLY THE HIGH MEN THEY ARE NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER THE LONG LIFE THAT THEY WERE GRANTED DECEIVES THEM AND THEY DALLY IN THE WORLD CHILDREN IN MIND UNTIL AGE FINDS THEM AND THEN MANY ONLY FORSAKE PLAY OUT OF DOORS FOR PLAY IN THEIR HOUSES THEY TURN THEIR PLAY INTO GREAT MATTERS AND GREAT MATTERS INTO PLAY THEY WOULD BE CRAFTSMEN AND LOREMASTERS AND HEROES ALL AT ONCE ALL THINGS WERE MADE FOR THEIR SERVICE HILLS ARE FOR QUARRIES RIVERS TO FURNISH WATER OR TO TURN WHEELS TREES FOR BOARDS WOMEN FOR THEIR NEED OR IF FAIR TO ADORN THEIR TABLE AND HEARTH TO ALL THEY ARE GRACIOUS AND KIND MERRY AS LARKS IN THE MORNING IF THE SUN SHINES FOR THEY ARE NEVER WRATHFUL IF THEY CAN AVOID IT MEN SHOULD BE GAY THEY HOLD GENEROUS AS THE RICH GIVING AWAY WHAT THEY DO NOT NEED ANGER THEY SHOW WHEN THEY BECOME AWARE SUDDENLY THAT THERE ARE OTHER WILLS IN THE WORLD BESIDE THEIR OWN THEY WILL BE AS RUTHLESS AS HEADWIND IF ANYTHING DARE TO WITHSTAND THEM NÚMENOR WAS TO BE A REST AFTER WAR BUT IF THEY WEARY OF REST AND THE PLAYS OF PEACE SOON THEY WILL GO BACK TO THEIR GREAT PLAY MANSLAYING AND WAR ALDARION AND BRENDIS

HOWEVER THERE IS A PERIOD OF DARKNESS WHERE THINGS ARE NO LONGER SO CLEAR CUT BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE OTHER DÚNEDAIN BECAUSE OF THEIR REBELLION AKALLABÊTH DURING THIS PERIOD BEGINNING AROUND THE TIME OF THE KING OF NÚMENOR THE MEN OBJECT TO ELROD DECISION TO BECOME MORTAL AND THEY WISH FOR THE DOOM FATE OF THE ELVES

LATER WHEN THEY BECAME POWERFUL THEY BEGRUDGED THE CHOICE OF THEIR FOREFATHER DESIRING THE IMMORTALITY WITHIN THE LIFE OF THE WORLD THAT WAS THE FATE OF THE ELDAR AND MURMURING AGAINST THE BAN THE NÚMENÓREAN KINGS

THEIR FEAR OF DEATH AND ABANDONING THE ASSIMILATION OF THEIR MODE OF LIFE TO THAT OF THE ELDAR THE LINE OF ELROD NOTE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DIMINISHMENT IN THE HOUSE AND THE MEN THE MAJORITY PARTY IN NÚMENOR

THEIR YEARS LESSENED AS THEIR FEAR OF DEATH GREW AKALLABÊTH

YET THERE WERE DESCENDANTS OF ELROD THE LORDS OF ANDÚNIË WHO WERE PART OF THE MINORITY PARTY THE FAITHFUL IN NÚMENOR WHO WERE NOT SO MUCH EFFECTED BY THIS DIMINISHMENT SINCE THEY DID NOT GO SO MUCH OFF OF THE RAILS WHERE THE LAST KING OF NÚMENOR FELT HIS DEATH COMING ON AROUND YEARS OF AGE HIS COUSIN ELENDIL DIED IN BATTLE AGAINST SARON WHEN HE WAS ABOUT YEARS OF AGE

WHEN THEIR ISLAND SUNK MIDDLE-EARTH ALONG WITH THIS LOSS WERE TWO OTHER INGREDIENTS IN THIS WANING PROCESS IT WAS DUE ABOVE ALL TO MIDDLE-EARTH ITSELF AND TO THE SLOW WITHDRAWING OF THE GIFTS OF THE NÚMENÓREANS AFTER THE DOWNFALL OF THE LAND OF THE STAR CONDOR AND THE HEIRS OF ANÁRION AS THEY ABODE IN MIDDLE-EARTH THREE THINGS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE DIMINISHMENT OF THE DUNEDIN IN CONDOR WAS THE THE GREAT PLAGUE AND THE WAR WITH THE WAINRIDERS BEGINNING IN AND ENDING IN AFTER EÄRNIL LL SAVES CONDOR FROM ANNIHILATION
BECAUSE THIS IS FANTASY
HIS MISSION IN MIDDLE EARTH IS TO GIVE HELP AND COUNSEL TO THE FREE PEOPLES ANY ENEMIES OF SARON REALLY HE IS ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY COMMANDED NOT TO USE HIS POWERS EXCEPT AT GREATEST NEED

NOTICE HOW GANDALF DOESN'T START FIGHTS BUT WILL STAND HIS GROUND IF FLIGHT IS IMPOSSIBLE AGAINST THE WAGS THE BARONG AND THE EVEN HE ALWAYS SAYS SOME VARIATION OF GANDALF IS HERE YOU MAY NOT PASSIVE
AT SOME POINT THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE A STICKED POST THAT ANSWERS THIS QUESTION I'VE LOST COUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I'VE SEEN IT ASKED HERE
BECAUSE HE'S THE KING
RELEASING THE ARMY OF THE DEAD WAS SYMBOLIC OF STATUS AS HEIR CONTROLLING THEM WAS TOO BUT GANDALF WASN'T THERE FOR THAT ALSO EVENTS WERE PRETTY URGENT BEFORE THE VICTORY AT PELENNOR SO MAYBE NO TIME FOR BOWING AND FORMALITIES AND THUS AS THE RIGHTFUL KING OF CONDOR AND AFNOR

MORE SPECIFICALLY I BELIEVE IT'S KIND OF AN BETWEEN ARAGON AND GANDALF THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER A LONG TIME AND BOTH ARE WELL AWARE OF HISTORY AS WELL AS HIS INTENTIONS IN THE WAR MEANING HIS ULTIMATE GOAL OF CLAIMING THE KINGSHIP I THINK THIS WAS WAY OF RECOGNIZING ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS OF RISE FROM RANGER TO KING

DELETED
SHE'S NOT THE BIGGEST PROMOTER OF HER WORK OR ANYTHING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT THAT THE PIECE TURNED OUT BEAUTIFULLY SO I WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH A COMMUNITY THAT I THOUGHT WOULD APPRECIATE IT
BEAUTIFUL KEEP IT UP

THAT IS SPECTACULAR WOULD BUY A COMPLETE ALBUM OF THAT
ALSO MAY OR MAY NOT USE IT NEXT TIME I'M DM A D D SESSION

BUT TRULY IT REMINDS IF THAT STORY AND MADE ME GO REREAD THE BITS AND PIECES OF IT AMAZING WORK
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
I NOTICE THAT YOUR WIFE HAS MENTIONED AN UPCOMING ALBUM INSPIRED BY THE WORKS OF TZOLKIN PLEASE POST THAT WHEN IT'S FINISHED VERY IMPRESSED BY THE TWO TRACKS SHE ALREADY HAS UP

BE SURE TO PUT THIS ON R TOLKIENMUSIC TOO
WHEN THE HOBBIT WAS WRITTEN IT WASN'T REALLY A PART OF THE MIDDLE-EARTH MYTHOLOGY JERT JUST TOOK SOME CONCEPTS AND IDEAS FROM HIS LARGER MYTHOLOGY AND WORKED THEM INTO THE STORY THE STORY OF LOAR ALSO DIDN'T EXIST YET SO IN THE FIRST EDITION OF THE HOBBIT BILBO IS GIVEN THE RING BY GOLLUM WHICH AT THAT POINT IS JUST A MAGIC RING REWRITTEN FOR LATER EDITIONS TO MAKE MORE SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ONE RING OF LOAR

TZOLKIN ALSO USES SOME DIFFERENT OR OLDER TERMINOLOGY

THEY DIFFERED FROM THE HIGH ELVES
OF THE WEST AND WERE MORE DANGEROUS AND LESS WISE FOR MOST OF THEM
TOGETHER WITH THEIR SCATTERED RELATIONS IN THE HILLS AND MOUNTAINS WERE
DESCENDED FROM THE ANCIENT TRIBES THAT NEVER WENT TO FAERIE IN THE WESTERN THERE THE AND THE AND THE WENT AND LIVED
FOR AGES AND GREW FAIRER AND WISER AND MORE LEARNED AND INVENTED THEIR
MAGIC AND THEIR CUNNING CRAFT IN THE MAKING OF BEAUTIFUL AND MARVELLOUS
THINGS BEFORE SOME CAME BACK INTO THE WIDE WORLD

SO FAERIE IS PROBABLY AN OLDER TERM FOR ALIENOR THE ARE PERHAPS PANYAR AND THE NOLUDAR AND THE TEFERI

AND YEAH THEY SEEM VERY DIFFERENT IN STONE AND STYLE THESE ELVES ARE SINGING TRALALALA INSTEAD OF ABOUT THEIR SORROW OR THEIR YEARNING FOR VLADAMAR AS THEY DO IN LOAR
MOST OF THIS IS VERY MISLEADING WHICH IS PAR FOR THE COURSE IN YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND ALL THE MORE UNFORTUNATE FOR THE DECENT PRODUCTION VALUES WHICH GENERALLY HELP PEOPLE TRUST IT

FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS NOT A DRAFT IN WHICH SARON WAS AN EVIL CAT THERE WAS A VERSION THE EARLIEST ONE THAT PREDATES THE INVENTION OF SARON IN WHICH THE ROLE IN THE NARRATIVE THAT SARON TOOK IN LATER VERSIONS WAS OCCUPIED BY AN EVIL CAT TEVILDO WAS NEVER SARON HE WAS NOT MODIFIED TO BE SARON HE WAS SCRAPPED AND SARON TOOK HIS PLACE THROUGH THIS TYPE OF PORTRAYAL I COULD EASILY MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT IN A DRAFT ARAGON APPEARS AS BILBO OR SAURURAN APPEARS AS TREEBEARD WHOEVER WROTE THIS WAS TOO BUSY TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING CURIOUS TO TALK ABOUT TO CARE ABOUT FACTS AND ARE GETTING AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE UNLIKE THE EXAMPLES I MENTIONED IT DOESN'T USE TWO RELATIVELY WELL-KNOWN CHARACTERS THAT WOULD RIP AWAY THE STANDARD WILLINGNESS TO BELIEVE
I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS IN FACT A SPIN OFF OF THE GREATER COLLECTION OF WORKS THAT BECAME THE SILMARILLION
SARON
NOT A SPINOFF GEES

IT WON'T HAPPEN BUT IF IT DID WHO WOULD WE WANT TO CAST AS BEDEN AND LUTHIER
SOURCE OF THE COSPLAYER IN THE THUMBNAIL
RAN ACROSS THIS WHILE SURFING YOUTUBE THOUGHTS
A GUY NAMED MORGOTH I KEEP WATCHING FROM THERE
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT'S INTENTIONAL I DO KNOW THAT SWORD IS ON THE IRON THRONE IN THE TV SERIES AS AN EASTER EGG
RUNE FOR REFERENCE
ALSO BILBO IS OLD WHEN HE LEFT THE SHIRE AND THAT WAS WHAT YEARS BEFORE FRODO STARTS OFF WITH SAM AND PIPPIN HE'S AT LEAST AT THE COUNCIL OF ELROD

HE WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT PAST THE FIRST WEIRD GHOST WOLF ATTACK I DOUBT HE COULD HAVE EVEN KEPT UP WITH AN EASY WALK
GANDALF HAS EXPERIENCE WATCHING MORTALS DIE BUT I DON'T THINK HE NECESSARILY SEES THAT AS A BAD THING PERHAPS HE IS AWARE THAT DEATH WAS MEANT AS A GIFT WHEN BOOMIER DIES HE SAYS HE ESCAPED HE STILL EXPRESSES SADNESS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BUT I THINK THAT LIKE ELROD IMPLIES DEATH IS BETTER THAN LIVING FOREVER BECAUSE OF A RING

ALSO INTERESTING HOW GIMLI HANDLES IT NOT VERY WELL DESPITE THE ORCS ATTACKING THE CHAMBER OF MAZARBÛL

THE OTHERS FOLLOWED BUT GIMLI HAD
TO BE DRAGGED AWAY BY PERGOLAS IN SPITE OF THE PERIL HE LINGERED BY
TOMB WITH HIS HEAD BOWED

I THINK GIMLI WAS TOO HOPEFUL WHILE FRODO EVEN SAYS THAT HE FEARED BALIN WAS DEAD BILBO REMARKS HOW HE WENT TO THE LONELY MOUNTAIN BUT THAT BALIN WAS NOT THERE
FOR COMPARISON

IT WAS LIKE A GREAT SHADOW IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH WAS A DARK FORM OF MAYBE YET GREATER AND A POWER AND TERROR SEEMED TO BE IN IT AND TO GO BEFORE IT



IT CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE FIRE AND THE LIGHT FADED AS IF A CLOUD HAD BENT OVER IT THEN WITH A RUSH IT LEAPED ACROSS THE FISSURE THE FLAMES ROARED UP TO GREET IT AND WREATHED ABOUT IT AND A BLACK SMOKE SWIRLED IN THE AIR ITS STREAMING MANE KINDLED AND BLAZED BEHIND IT IN ITS RIGHT HAND WAS A BLADE LIKE A STABBING TONGUE OF FIRE IN ITS LEFT IT HELD A WHIP OF MANY THONGS



HIS ENEMY HALTED AGAIN FACING HIM AND THE SHADOW ABOUT IT REACHED OUT LIKE TWO VAST WINGS IT RAISED THE WHIP AND THE THONGS WHINED AND CRACKED FIRE CAME FROM ITS NOSTRILS BUT GANDALF STOOD FIRM



HIS ENEMY HALTED AGAIN FACING HIM AND THE SHADOW ABOUT IT REACHED OUT LIKE TWO VAST WINGS IT RAISED THE WHIP AND THE THONGS WHINED AND CRACKED FIRE CAME FROM ITS NOSTRILS BUT GANDALF STOOD FIRM



I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T PUT WINGS ON IT
MISSING WINGS

S
THANKS NOW I HAVE TO FIND OR BUILD A LOAR CHESS SET LOL
LATELY I'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF MILEAGE OUT OF FOR LIKE A SHAFT CLEAR AND COLD THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIM THAT IN THE END THE SHADOW WAS ONLY A SMALL AND PASSING THING THERE WAS LIGHT AND HIGH BEAUTY FOR EVER BEYOND ITS REACH
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING I HAVE GOTTEN IS MY LOVE OF READING AGAIN I USED TO READ EVERY DAY AS A CHILD TEENAGER AND READING THE LOAR HOBBIT SILMARILLION LOST TALES AND NOW THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH HAS HELPED ME REDISCOVER THAT LOVE FOR READING I DON'T GO TO BED AT NIGHT WITHOUT A GOOD MINUTE SESSION IT'S WONDERFUL BEING WHISKED OFF INTO THIS MAGICAL WORLD
I HAD A SENSE OF WONDER I HAVEN'T FELT SINCE I WAS A CHILD AND I STILL DO BEING INTRODUCED TO AN ENTIRE FULLY DEVELOPED WORLD WAS MILD-BLOWING I'VE ALWAYS LOVED WORDBUILDING AND THE WORLDS BEHIND THE STORIES AND TZOLKIN WAS A MASTER OF CREATING THAT
TZOLKIN INTRODUCED ME TO FANDOM I DON'T PLAY D D OR VIDEO GAMES ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND I WAS NEVER VERY INTERESTED IN MYTHOLOGY AS A CHILD SO ME WAS THE DEEPEST WORLD I'D ENCOUNTERED THUS FAR AND WORKS WERE THE FIRST TIME I WAS INTRIGUED ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT MY OWN STORIES AND POEMS READ OTHERS OF COURSE I LATER DISCOVERED I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT IT BUT I HAD A HELL OF A LOT OF FUN IN THAT FANDOM AND LATER OTHERS

NOT SO BIG THEN BUT INTERESTING ALL THE SAME

IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT I ACTUALLY GET OUT OF READING THE BOOKS WITH THE FILM IT'S MOSTLY NOSTALGIA AND ENJOYMENT BUT IT'S LOAR THAT I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THERE'S A STRONG CURRENT OF HOPE CAMARADERIE FRIENDSHIP AND LIGHTHEARTEDNESS RUNNING THROUGH IT THAT I USED TO ANYWAY FIND IMMENSELY COMFORTING AGAIN NOTHING HUGE BUT THERE'S A COMPLETENESS TO IT A SENSE OF SATISFACTION THAT IS VERY HARD TO FIND ELSEWHERE PROBABLY PARTLY DUE TO THE LENGTH
BEST I COULD FIND
THERE WERE ORIGINALLY A GREAT NUMBER OF BRIDGES

ALL OF THEM HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY THE TIME OF THE WAR OF THE RING
MARTIN PERFORMANCE IS BY FAR THE GREATEST THING ABOUT THESE MOVIES I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYONE ELSE TO PLAY OUR BELOVED BURGLAR
IN THE BOOK BILBO SEES THORIN BEFORE HE DIES

QDCUIQK
I THOUGHT THE BOOK HAD THORON DIE AFTER THE BATTLE AND HE HAD A CHANCE TO RECONCILE WITH BILBO HONESTLY MOVIE THORIN HAD FEW IF ANY REDEEMABLE QUALITIES
I WAS MORE UPSET BY HOW FILI AND AILI DIE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN IN THE BOOKS THEY DIE WHILE DEFENDING A FALLEN THORIN AGAINST THE TROLL GUARD OF BELG UNTIL BEHORN ARRIVES I JUST COULDN'T STAND HOW THE SCENE PLAYED OUT IN THE MOVIES THEY HAD THEIR ENJOYABLE MOMENTS BUT I SAT THROUGH 2 AND HALF MOVIES JUST TO SEE THIS BATTLE
JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THE TOP COMMENT IS TOTALLY RIGHT THORIN GETS WOUNDED AND FILI AND AILI ARE THE ONES WHO DIE THEN BEHORN RESCUES HIM AND BILBO AND THORIN RECONCILE SO FUCKING SORRY ABOUT THAT CHECKED MY BOOK FIRST BUT FOR SOME REASON I WAS DAMN SURE THAT THORIN DIED

AGAIN TOTALLY SORRY FOR THE MISINFORMATION

EDIT IT'S NO LONGER THE TOP COMMENT MORE LIKE THE SECOND OR THIRD
FAREWELL MASTER BURGLAR GO BACK TO YOUR BOOKS AND YOUR ARMCHAIR PLANT YOUR TREES WATCH THEM GROW IF MORE PEOPLE VALUED HOME ABOVE GOLD THIS WORLD WOULD BE A MERRIER PLACE
NOOOOOOOOO

THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT DRAGONSICKNESS HAD DRIVEN HIM TO VIOLENCE AND AS HAPPENS WHEN WE DO VIOLENCE HE DIED A RANDOM MEANINGLESS AND UNDIGNIFIED DEATH WAR DOES NOT HAVE A SATISFYING STORY RESOLUTION AND THAT IS WHAT TZOLKIN MADE CLEAR BY HAVING THE QUEST FOR THE MOUNTAIN SNUFF OUT AN ENTIRE FAMILY LINE IN UTTERLY AVOIDABLE VIOLENCE
NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO HAVE A STORY BOOK EMOTIONAL GOODBYE OR REDEMPTION MOMENT SOMETIMES THINGS JUST END AND YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT THE HOBBIT AND LOAR HAVE MANY OF THOSE MOMENTS NAMELY A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN MAN KILLING SMUG THE DWARVES NEVER GET THEIR BRAVE MOMENT VS THE DRAGON DAMN SCOOBY DOO CHASE SCENE TRYING TO FORCE EMOTION IS THE BIGGEST FAULT OF THE HOBBIT MOVIES AND IT'S EXEMPLIFIED HERE COMPLETE WITH FINAL SHOWDOWN BS I WILL SAY IT'S MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN WHY DOES IT HURT CAUSE IT WAS REAL VOMIT THAT TAKES ME COMPLETELY OUT OF THE MOVIE
I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE USED HIS ORIGINAL WORDS INSTEAD OF SHORTENING THEM I THINK THEY ARE FAR MORE POWERFUL

IF MORE OF US VALUED FOOD AND CHEER AND SONG ABOVE HOARDED GOLD IT WOULD BE A MERRIER WORLD BUT SAD OR MERRY I MUST LEAVE IT NOW FAREWELL
NO HE DIDN'T DIE ON THE BATTLEFIELD HE AND BILBO HAD A RECONCILIATION BEFORE HE DIED ONE OF THE IF NOT THE MOST MOVING PART OF THE BOOK
DEATH IN THE MOVIES WAS CAUSED BY SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EVEN ALIVE
EXCEPT IN THE MOVIE THORIN IS STABBED RIGHT THROUGH THE CHEST BECAUSE HE WAS TOO STUPID TO WEAR ANY MITHRAIC AND TOOK ALL HIS ARMOR OFFICIAL

AND HE WAS ABLE TO STAB AGOG RIGHT THROUGH HIS ARMOR MAKING IT AS USELESS AS A THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN FIGHTS ARE SHOT IN MOTION CAPTURE
ALSO THAT BEAUTIFUL PARALLEL WITH DEATH THROUGH THE SENTENCE FORGIVE ME I WAS TOO BLIND TO SEE
YES UNFORTUNATELY AND DEATHS SUCKS ESPECIALLY THE WHOLE TAURINE NONSENSE DOESN'T EXIST AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
YEA THORIN AND BILBO MEET AGAIN AND PART IN FRIENDSHIP IT'S KIND OF A BIG PART IN THE END OF THE BOOK LIKE THE CONCLUSION TO THE WHOLE BETRAYAL PLOT THING THORIN IS NOT SIMPLY FOUND DEAD ON THE BATTLEFIELD
IT WAS A GREAT SCENE I'M NO BIG SUPPORTER OF THE HOBBIT FILMS BUT WHAT WAS RIGHT WAS ALMOST PERFECT WHAT WAS WRONG WAS REALLY WRONG AND BY THAT I MEAN TAURINE
WHILE THIS MAY BE TRUE AND HERE I'M NOT SAYING THE MOVIE DID OR DID NOT DO A GOOD JOB NOR AM COMMENTING ON HOW ANY MOVIE MAY DEPICT DEATH SCENES I PREFER VERSION AND BELIEVE IT TO BE A WELL THOUGHT OF DEPICTION OR LACK THEREOF I THINK TZOLKIN IS PARTIALLY COMMENTING ON THE CONFUSION AND LACK OF A CLEAR IMAGE THAT ANYONE WOULD HAVE IN A BATTLE THINK OF HOW AN IRON AGE BATTLE WOULD GO DOWN ESPECIALLY ONE OF GREAT SIZE AND CONFUSION ONE SIDE OF THE BATTLE WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WOULD BE GOING ON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BATTLE IT'S ABSOLUTE CHAOS ORDERED TO A DEGREE AND THAT IS WHY I LOVE HOW TZOLKIN DIDN'T FLESH OUT DEATH
I CAN SEE WHY YOU'D LIKE THIS SCENE BUT SO MANY THINGS ABOUT WHAT PRECEDED IT TURNED ME OFFICIAL THE PART WHERE ONLY THREE ACTORS JUST SORT OF WANDER OFF ALONE INSTEAD OF THORIN BEING IN THE THICK OF A PITCHED BATTLE WITH HIS COMPANY AROUND HIM AS HE DID IN THE BOOKS THE WAY THE FIGHT WAS DRAWN OUT AND PADDED WITH UNNECESSARY ACTION BITS

AND MORE THAN ANYTHING THAT STUPID STUPID MOMENT IT'S BAD BECAUSE IT WAS A FALSE END AND THE SURPRISE DIDN'T FEEL EARNED IT FELT CHEAP AND PULLED OUT OF NOWHERE JUST TO GIVE THE AUDIENCE A JUMP NOT TO MENTION HOW IMPROBABLE IT ALL IS ARE WE REALLY SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT AN ORC WOULD CLOSE HIS EYES AND PRETEND TO BE DEAD AND ALLOW HIMSELF TO DRIFT ALONG UNDER THE ICE JUST ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT IT ALLOWS HIM TO CATCH HIS OPPONENT OFF-GUARD HOW COULD HE HAVE KNOWN THAT CONDITIONS WERE JUST RIGHT TO BRING HIM INTO STRIKING POSITION HOW ON EARTH COULD HE MOVE UNDERWATER WHICH SLOWS YOUR MOVEMENTS WITH ENOUGH SPEED AND POWER TO PUNCH UP THROUGH ICE THICK ENOUGH TO WALK ON AND STRIKE A MOBILE TARGET AND INFLICT A SERIOUS ENOUGH WOUND TO MAKE THE GAMBIT WORTHWHILE I MEAN SERIOUSLY GO TAKE AN ICE PICK SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE TASK OF STABBING THROUGH ICE AND TRY TO PUNCH IT CLEAN THROUGH A FOUR-INCH BRICK OF ICE IN ONE GO NOW IMAGINE DOING THAT WITH LIMITED MOBILITY IN FREEZING WATER JUST NUMBER IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN THE LET'S RIDE ON A RIVER OF MOLTEN METAL WITHOUT ANY PAIN OR SUFFOCATION AND USE A GIANT DWARF TO ATTACK THE DRAGON BUSINESS FROM MOVIE 2
I COULDN'T EVEN MAKE IT THIS FAR IN THE MOVIES BTW IN THE BOOKS THORIN IS SHIELDED BY HIS NEPHEWS BUT STILL GRAVELY WOUNDED HE AND BILBO RECONCILE AND THORIN APOLOGIZES BEFORE HE PASSES I COULD NOT STAND WHAT P DID TO THE HOBBIT GLAD YOU FOUND SOMETHING REDEEMING IN THE MOVIES BUT I PREFER THE BOOKS

SCENE FROM THE ORIGINAL HOBBIT MOVIE
THE FUCK YOU TALKING ABOUT THORIN WAS MORTALLY INJURED BUT SURVIVED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM AN BILBO TO HAVE A TOUCHING FAREWELL THORIN FORGIVES HIM FOR STEALING THE ARKENSTONE AND ADMIRES HIS LOVE ONLY OF FOOD AND CHEER INSTEAD OF GOLD AND JEWELS

THIS SCENE IS OUTSTANDING IN THE HOBBIT TRILOGY IN THAT IT MERELY FAILS TO BUTCHER THE SOURCE MATERIAL
FOUND IT VERY BORING I MEAN THE SCENE ITSELF ISN'T TOO TERRIBLE BUT THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT LEADING UP TO IT WAS EXCITED IN A VERY MEDIOCRE FASHION SO WHEN HE DIED I DIDN'T REALLY CARE BOOK THORIN AS WELL AS THE ANIMATED HOBBIT DID A GREAT JOB OF PORTRAYING THORIN
EH IT'S ALRIGHT THERE WAS NOTHING GREAT TO ME IN ANY OF THE HOBBIT MOVIES
I DISAGREE I DIDN'T FIND HIS DEATH SAD NOR EMOTIONAL
I DO HOPE I'M NOT ALONE IN KIND OF DISLIKING THE THIRD HOBBIT MOVIE I FOUND IT TO BE FAR TOO FULL OF CGI A CGI DWARF CHARACTER COME ON NOW ALSO THE CGI PERGOLAS JUMPING UP THE FALLING BRIDGE WAS PRETTY CRINGEWORTHY

SMUG DYING IN THE FIRST MINUTES WAS KIND OF FRUSTRATING IT WASN'T ANYWHERE NEAR AS EPIC OF AN EVENT IN THE MOVIE AS IN THE BOOK THE LAST OF BURINS LINE DID NOT DIE IN THE MOVIE THE WAY THEY DID IN THE BOOK EITHER

I GET THAT MOVIES MAKE ALLOWANCES ON THE STORY AND THAT IT WON'T BE THE SAME I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE CHOICES MADE BY P FOR SPECIFICALLY THE THIRD HOBBIT EVERY OTHER LOAR WAS FANTASTIC THOUGH
P FEEL THE NEED TO BUTCHER THAT PERFECT LINE FROM THE BOOK
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TRADITIONAL TO EMOTIONAL
I DISAGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK THE FILMS DID A HORRIBLE JOB WITH ALL THINGS THORIN

THAT IS ALL
WELP I GUESS THIS MEANS I HAVE TO FINALLY GET DOWN TO WATCHING THE FINAL MOVIE
TOO BAD THAT SERIES IS LIKE DRINKING A SHIT SMOOTHIE BECAUSE OF THE FEW PIECES OF CHOCOLATE IN IT LIKE THE SCENE ABOVE
YES
OFFENDED ME
HOBBIT IS TRASH WITH NEAR REDEEMING QUALITIES
I'M GLAD THAT HE DIED DUE TO A GOOD REASON AND THAT WE GOT TO SEE IT FIRST-HAND

I HATED THE WAY HOW HE DIED IN THE BOOKS BILBO DIDN'T GET TO EVEN SEE HIM GET MORTALLY WOUNDED FROM A DISTANCE
THERE ARE SOME BOOKS ADAPTATIONS THAT OWE A HUGE DEBT TO THE SCREENWRITER
YEAH WELL DONE P FOR MAKING ME ROOT FOR THE ORC ARMY TO ELIMINATE ALL THE DWARVES LOL

WITH TAURINE AND THE DWARVES I WAS LIKE JEEZ JUST DIE AND SKIP TO BILBO OR THRANDUIL
WELL DONE P ARE YOU SERIOUS TZOLKIN WOULD BE ROLLING IN HIS GRAVE OVER WHAT P DID TO THIS BOOK
PJ'S MOVIES ARE LIKE A CHILD ACTOR A GOOD CHILD ACTOR WHEN THEY STARTED OFF EVERYONE LOVED THEM BUT THEN SOMEWHERE IN THE TEENAGE YEARS THEY GROW ENTITLED AND REST ON THEIR LAURELS BEFORE GOING CRAZY ON METH OR COKE AND GET ARRESTED THEN THEY COME BACK AGAIN AND MAKE A BUNCH OF CRAP MOVIES OR HAVE A CRAP POP STAR CAREER
GANDALF SAURURAN RADAGAST AND THE OTHER TWO WIZARDS ARE MAAR THINK OF THEM AS LESSER ANGELS WHENEVER ONE OF THESE USE THEIR MAGIC IT IS ACTUALLY A DIVINE BEING EXERTING THEIR POWER ON THE WORLD

WHEN GANDALF AND THE BARONG A FALLEN MAIA FIGHT ON THE BRIDGE OF HE SAYS

YOU CANNOT PASS HE SAID THE ORCS STOOD STILL AND A DEAD SILENCE FELL I AM A SERVANT OF THE SECRET FIRE WIELDER OF THE FLAME OF ACOR

HERE MITHRANDIR I'M TIRED OF SAYING GANDALF SIMPLY IDENTIFIES HIMSELF AS A SERVANT OF ERU ILÚVATAR AKA GOD THE SECRET FIRE IS MORE OR LESS THE ABILITY TO CREATE ACOR IS THE ELVISH WORD FOR SUN NO ONE'S REALLY SURE WHAT THAT PART MEANS EXACTLY BUT IT SERVES AS ANOTHER FORM OF IDENTIFICATION AND A WAY OF SAYING BACK UP SON

THE DARK FIRE WILL NOT AVAIL YOU FLAME OF UNDEN GO BACK TO THE SHADOW YOU CANNOT PASSIVE

UNDEN IS THE SINDARIN WORD FOR HELL WHICH WAS CALLED UTUMNO IN QUENDA AND WAS THE FIRST FORTRESS OF MORGOTH MENTOR AND LEADER DARK FIRE AND SHADOW COULD BE REFERRING TO MORGOTH HIMSELF AGAIN THIS IS MITHRANDIR SAYING THAT HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S FACING

THE REASON THAT I'M USING THIS PART AS AN EXAMPLE IS BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY TIME WE REALLY SEE OLÓRIN GOT TIRED OF SAYING MITHRANDIR IN HIS TRUE FORM THE INSTAR OR WIZARDS WERE SENT TO MIDDLE-EARTH TO ACT AS GUIDES TO THE CHILDREN OF ILÚVATAR IN THE WAR AGAINST SARON THEY WERE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THEIR MAGIC BECAUSE WHEN THE ALAR THINK ARCHANGELS FOUGHT MORGOTH IN THE ELDER DAYS A CONTINENT WAS DESTROYED THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN SO GANDALF AND THE OTHER INSTAR WERE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THEIR FULL POWER HOWEVER BECAUSE THE BARONG WAS A SERVANT OF MORGOTH THOSE RULES DIDN'T APPLY AND HAD GANDALF NOT UNVEILED HIMSELF AT THAT MOMENT TO FIGHT SQUARELY WITH THE BARONG THE FELLOWSHIP WOULD HAVE FAILED

SO WHEN IT COMES TO WIZARDS THEY CAN'T USE MAGIC TO DIRECTLY INTERVENE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MORTALS

NOW A LOT OF THINGS GENERALLY ELDEN THINGS ARE CALLED MAGIC THEY ARE IN A SENSE BUT IT'S MORE OF A CRAFT THAT THE HOBBITS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND AND HAS SINCE BEEN LOST TO US
LIKE THE DUDE SAID ABOVE THEY ARE LESSER ANGELS CALLED MAAR BOUND IN A HUMAN FORM THEREFORE THEY JUST CAN DO THINGS THAT REALLY AREN'T SPECIFIED AS TO HOW OR WHAT THEY DON'T CAST SPELLS OR HAVE SPECIFIED LIMITS THEY CAN JUST DO STUFF

TZOLKIN WAS NEVER SUPER SPECIFIC ABOUT THOSE MECHANICS FOR AND I AM GUESSING HERE A GOOD REASON I THINK HE WANTED IT TO BE ENIGMATIC LIKE HIS DWARVES SO THAT THERE WERE MYSTERIES AND ENIGMAS IN HIS WORLD IT KEEPS YOU FROM KNOWING EVERYTHING SO COLORIN REMAINS A MYSTERIOUSLY POWERFUL ANCIENT BEING WHO WE DON'T OR CAN'T COMPREHEND JUST WHAT HE IS OR WHAT HE CAN DO MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN HEY THAT GUY CAN DO X
WHILE I WAS STUDYING THE SILMARILLIAN A COUPLE YEARS AGO I MADE A SILENT AGREEMENT WITH MYSELF TO DELIBERATELY TREAT THE SAGA AS UNTIL I FINISHED THE BOOK IT GAVE ME MOTIVATION TO PUSH ON THROUGH TO THE END BUT IT ENDED UP MAKING THE WHOLE LEARNING EXPERIENCE ABOUT OUR PAST MUCH RICHER I CAN EASILY FLIP BACK AND FORTH NOW BETWEEN REAL MODE AND ME MODE IN WHICH EVENTS OF TODAY APPEAR AS IF THEY WERE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A FUTURE ME I EAST WITH THE INFLUENCE OF POWERFUL EXTERNAL AGENCIES ETC IT'S A GAME AND ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T DONE IT IN A WHILE BUT AS IAN MALCOLM FAMOUSLY QUIPPED THERE IT IS
HISTORICAL NOT SINCE I WAS A KID MYTHICAL ALL THE TIME
RARELY FOR A MOMENT

WHEN I WAS A KID THE TOP OF MY HEAD NEARLY CAME OFF WHEN I READ THAT IT WAS ALL A TRANSLATION OF THE RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH FOR ABOUT AN HOUR UNTIL I REALIZED THAT ALSO WAS HIS INVENTION
I LIKE TO THINK THAT'S IT'S SIMILAR TO A BIBLE AND TZOLKIN WAS LIKE IT'S PROPHET THE WORLD REALLY WAS CREATED BY ERU AND THE UNIVERSE WAS SUNG INTO EXISTENCE AND ALL THAT OBVIOUSLY NOT SERIOUSLY BUT IT'S FUN TO THINK OF IT'S CUNNER THAN BORING NORMAL RELIGIONS AND MORE BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN THAN HISTORY BOOKS SO I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT MIDDLE EARTH HISTORY IS EARTH HISTORY THE ELVES HAVE ALL LEFT THE MONSTERS HAVE DIED OFF MAGIC BECAME SCIENCE AND WE'RE WAITING ON THE SECOND COMING OF RADAGAST THE BROWN TO PROTECT NATURE AGAINST MAN'S CONTINUING POLLUTION
NEVER
I MEAN IT WAS INTENTION FOR LOAR AND ASSOCIATED TEXTS TO BE A MYTHOLOGY AND THAT ARDA IS EARTH
THERE ARE TWO MAIN FACTORS AT PLAY IN LIMITING THE OVERALL POPULATION OF THE ELVES IN MIDDLE-EARTH

THE FIRST IS THAT BY THE TIME OF LOAR THERE JUST AREN'T THAT MANY ELVES STILL IN MIDDLE-EARTH YOU'VE GOT THE PINDAR AND SILVAN ELVES OF THE KIRKWOOD AND LOTHLORIEN THEN THERE ARE THE FEW NOLUDAR REMAINING IN RIVENDELL AND NEAR THE HAVENS BY THE END OF THE 3RD AGE A GREAT MANY OF THE ELVES HAVE ALREADY LEFT THE SHORES OF MIDDLE-EARTH NEVER TO RETURN AND MORE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL NONE ARE LEFT OUTSIDE OF ALIENOR AND TOL ERESSËA

THEN COMES THE PHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY OF THE ELVES ELVES REACH FULL MATURITY AT SOMEWHERE NEAR YEARS OLD ELVES ALSO ONLY MARRY ONCE AND KEEP THAT SPOUSE FOREVER WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING CHILDREN ELVES CONSIDER IT TO BE EXTREMELY SPECIAL BECAUSE IT RESULTS IN THE CREATION OF NEW LIFE SO ELVES AS A GENERAL RULE HAVE VERY FEW CHILDREN AND HAVE CONSIDERABLE GAPS BETWEEN CHILDREN FOR INSTANCE ELROD AND HIS WIFE CELEBRÍAN HAD ONLY CHILDREN IN THE YEARS THEY WERE TOGETHER THEY ALSO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WANT TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN IN PEACETIME SINCE MIDDLE-EARTH IS GENERALLY FAR FROM PEACEFUL THAT ALSO LIMITS ELF CHILDREN THE FINAL POINT IS THAT ELVES BEING IMMORTAL TEND TO EVENTUALLY FOCUS ON OTHER THINGS BESIDES MAKING KIDS THINGS THAT BEING THEM JOY AND HAPPINESS

COMBINE ALL THESE TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE THE REASON WHY ELVES HAVE OVERRUN THE WORLD IN SHEER NUMBERS

MIDDLE-EARTH IS MEANT TO BE A FICTIONAL PRE HISTORY OF OUR WORLD SO ELVES AND DWARVES HAVE TO DISAPPEAR SOMEHOW NOW BOTH OF THOSE PEOPLES SIMPLY BREED MORE SLOWLY THE ELVES ARE MONOGAMOUS AND HAVE FEW CHILDREN AND THE DWARVES HAD FEWER WOMEN AND ALSO HAVE FEW CHILDREN NOW ELVES ALSO GROW WEARY OF MIDDLE-EARTH AND FEEL THE NEED TO GO TO THE WEST AND LEAVE MIDDLE-EARTH IT'S NOT IN THE MOVIES AND I DON'T THINK WE GET A SPECIFIC TIMELINE BUT SOON AFTER THE END OF LOAR LOTHLÓRIEN IS ABANDONED COMPLETELY ARAGON DIES SOME YEARS AFTER LOAR AND ARWEN GOES TO DIE IN LOTHLÓRIEN AND THERE IS NO ONE THERE ANYMORE YEARS IS PRETTY QUICK CONSIDERING THE LONG LIVES OF ELVES BUT THE THREE RINGS OF THE ELVES WERE USED TO PRESERVE THE FEELING OF THE FIRST AGE WHICH IS THE REASON FOR THE TIMELESS FEELING OF RIVENDELL AND LOTHLÓRIEN BUT WHEN THE ONE RING WAS DESTROYED THE THREE RINGS ALSO LOST THEIR POWER AS THEY WERE TIED TO IT

GALADRIEL HAD A CHANCE TO DO THE WRONG THING BY ACCEPTING FRODO OFFERING HER THE ONE RING AND SHE WAS TAMPED BUT REFUSED

I PASS THE TEST SHE SAID I WILL DIMINISH AND GO INTO THE WEST AND
REMAIN GALADRIEL

NOW GALADRIEL AND CELEBORN EVENTUALLY WENT TO THE HAVENS AND TRAVELED WEST BUT THEIR DAUGHTER CELEBRÍAN LEFT EVEN EARLIER AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER CHILDREN AND BOTH ARE OLDER THAN ELROD WHO IS HUSBAND TO CELEBRÍAN

NOW FOR A SHORT TIMELINE IN THE SILMARILLION IT IS MENTIONED HOW ERU ILÚVATAR GOD CREATED THE AINU ANGELS MORE OR LESS AND TOGETHER THEY CREATED THE WORLD NOW THE PLAN WAS THAT THERE WERE THE CHILDREN OF ILÚVATAR ELVES AND MEN MORTALS THE ELVES AWOKE FIRST AND THE ALAR WHO WERE THE LEADERS OF THE AINU INVITED THEM TO COME LIVE IN THE WESTERN MANY OF THEM STARTED TO TRAVEL WEST BUT SOME ABANDONED THE JOURNEY A BUNCH OF STUFF HAPPENS BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE ELVES WERE MORE OR LESS MEANT TO GO WEST AND LEAVE MIDDLE-EARTH

BY THE TIME OF LOAR THE ELVES HAVE HAD A VERY LONG DECLINE RIVENDELL IS JUST A HOUSE HIDDEN IN A VALLEY LOTHLÓRIEN IS A HIDDEN REALM IN A FOREST THAT MEN KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE GREY HAVENS ARE EVEN UNKNOWN BY SOME OF THE ELVES AND EVEN THOUGH THE HOBBITS LIVE RIGHT NEXT DOOR THEY DON'T VISIT AND THERE IS KIRKWOOD WHERE PERGOLAS IS FROM AND THERE ARE SOME TRAVELING COMPANIES THAT'S IT
THE BOOK CALLED SILMARILLION WILL HELP YOU TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS

ELVES DID RULE THE WORLD AND BY THE WORLD I MEAN MOSTLY BELERIAND AND THEY HAD MULTIPLE KINGDOMS THE TIMES AROUND YEARS BEFORE LOAR BEFORE THE BIRTH OF SUN AND THE THAT TIME THE MAIN VILLAIN THEN WAS MORGOTH WHO'S SERVANT WAS ELVES HAD MANY DIFFICULTIES FIGHTING MORGOTH ALONG THE FACT THAT MOST OF THEM LEFT MANY YEARS BEFORE TO UNDYING LANDS WHERE MALARS AND MARMAR LIVE SOME SORT OF ANGELS THE ELVES ARE NOT SO INTERESTED IN NUMBERS OF CHER THE SUN FIRST ARISED THE MEN AWOKE BUT QUICKLY FELL TO THE SHADOW OF THE DARK CAME TO BELERIAND RUNNING AWAY FROM THE DARKNESS AND SPLIT INTO GROUPS WHO BECAME KNOWN AS THE ELF FRIENDS THE NUMENOREANS INCLUDING ELROD AND ARAGON DESCENDED FROM THEM AND HELPED THE ELVES IN THEIR WARS AGAINST MORGOTH WAS BANISHED AND BELERIAND DESTROYED THE ELVES BAGAN TO FADE SO MOST WENT TO GREATNESS WAS GONE AND THE RULE OF MEN IS YET TO COME IT CAME AFTER DEFEAT THEY WERE LITERALLY FADING AWAY SLOWLY AS THEY WERE AGING IN DISAPPEARED SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR OF THE RING WAS WON

ERU ILLUVATAR THE GOD HAD ELVES AND THE MEN AS HIS CHILDREN AND IT WAS MEANT FOR MEN TO PREVAIL IN MIDDLE-EARTH
THE ISSUE WITH THE ELVES IS THAT BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG LIVES MANY OF THEM BECOME UNAMBITIOUS AND OFTEN DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE EVENTS OUTSIDE OF THE OWN REALMS

ALSO IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF ELF BABIES BEING BORN
YES ALONG THE SAME LINES THIS SCENE ALWAYS DOES IT FOR ME
WATCH V ZIAJB

IT'S MOMENTS LIKE THOSE THAT MAKE THE MOVIES WORTH IT
I NEEDED THAT RIGHT NOW THANKS
SOME OF THE TRILOGY WAS AMAZING I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THE FIRST MOVIE BUT THE FILLER IS THE KORAT POSSIBLE FILLER CONTENTION
I LIKED HOBBIT PART AND AND BELIEVE THAT P DID SOME AWESOME THINGS WITH THE LITTLE TIME HE HAD DEATH FUCKING BEAUTIFUL THERE I SAID IT COME AT ME WITH YOUR TORCHES AND PITCHFORKS
SCREW ANYONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE THESE MOVIES

YES IT IS A GOOD SCENE
OKAY BUT LET'S JUST BE HONEST HERE GALADRIEL DID NOT HANG OUT AT RIVENDELL IF ANYTHING GANDALF VISITED HER IN LOTHLORIEN RIGHT
YEAH BUT WILL IT HAVE COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF FANSERVICE THOUGH LIKE AT LEAST PERGOLAS SHOULD POP UP ONCE OR THRICE
PLEASE WHATEVER THEY DO DON'T TURN A 2 HOUR STORY INTO A HOUR TRILOGY
NO SHIT SHELDON
REMINDME YEAR WAS THE FILM GOOD
TRANSLATION PLEASE COME SEE OUR MOVIE YOU LIKED LORD OF THE RINGS RIGHT
DO THEY MEAN THAT THE LORE WILL BE FLESHED OUT WITH PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN WRITINGS
WILL THEY ADD A ROMANCE BETWEEN HIM AND A DWARF THOUGH THAT WOULD ADD SOME DEPTH TO THE STORY
I WONDER HOW THEY'RE GOING TO SLIDE A BIRACIAL LOVE AFFAIR IN IT
WAITING FOR THE DISC BOXED SET WITH THIS PLUS ALL MOVIES TO REPLACE MY DISC BOXED SET WHICH REPLACED MY DISC BOXED SET WHICH REPLACED BUT ONLY IF IT COMES WITH BOOKENDS
VERY EXCITED FOR THIS I REALLY ENJOYED LEARNING ABOUT TZOLKIN THOUGH HIS SONS COMMENTARY IN THE ADDITIONAL PUBLISHED BOOKS IT WOULD BE GREAT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HIM IN A DOC
I SEE THIS SUB HAS FINALLY FOUND THAT YOUTUBE CHANNEL
THIS ONE IS FAR SUPERIOR IMO
I'M SAD IT DIDN'T END WITH THIS
I'VE BEEN SUBSCRIBED TO THE FACEBOOK PAGE FOR AWHILE PURE GOLD
ANYONE KNOW WHAT SONG THIS IS
THE ENDING CARD OF GOLLUM GANDALF AND THE CHANNEL BANNER OF FRODO AND SAM IS JUST SO HIDEOUSLY HILARIOUS
START EM YOUNG RAISE EM RIGHT
YAY LOAR AV MOVIES GOOD CHOICE
THE SILMARILLS AS WELL



AND I SEE THEY SHOW EXCALIBUR IN THE STONE EVERYONE KNOWS THE STORY OF THE SWORD COMING OUT OF THE LAKE AND YET EVERY TIME I SEE A PICTURE IT'S IN THE STONE
NOT EXACTLY SURE BUT SELF PROMOTING YOUR OWN VIDEOS IS AGAINST THE RULES ANYWAYS I STILL LOVE THE THIRD AGE MOD GLAD PEOPLE STILL PLAY IT A LOT
WHO IS MAKING THESE THEY'RE MY NEW FAVORITE GIF TREND

I DID NOT EXPECT TO WATCH BOOMIER DIE TONIGHT UGH
YOU ACTUALLY MADE ME SPIT OUT MY BEER WELL DONE MATE
WHOEVER IS MAKING THESE IS A TERRIBLE PERSON
SHOULD HAVE DONE IT TIMES FOR EACH ARROW HE GETS HIT BY
YOU'RE GOING STRAIGHT TO MORDOR FOR LAUGHING AT THIS OME

SEE U THERE
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE POST THE ORIGINAL SCENE
THESE ARE AMAZING
EDIT YES UNDERNAME DOES CHECK OUT
PADDY YOU'RE ON A ROLL KEEP THEM COMING I'M LAZY
MIND YOUR AIM
HAVE YOU READ IT TZOLKIN TAKES PAINS TO SUBCRENATE SOMETHING AT LEAST CONSISTENT WITH CHRISTIAN THEMES

ITS A FICTIONAL PREHISTORY TO THE IN MIND CHRISTIAN PRESENT I'D CALL IT AT LEAST AS CHRISTIAN AS LEWIS SPACE TRILOGY
I MEAN HE WAS A DEVOUT CATHOLIC WHO WROTE VERY BIBLICAL THEMES IN HIS WRITING THOUGH HE WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO BE VIEWED AS ALLEGORY
YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT A GOOD CHRISTIAN BOOKSTORE HAS IN STOCK
YOU WANT APPENDIX C FROM THE END OF RETURN OF THE KING TONNES OF HOBBIT FAMILY TREES
WHEN LAST I LOOKED THEOWMEN NOT ARAGON WAS KING OF ROHAN
WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH
FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T YET WATCHED IT CAPTAIN FANTASTIC IS AN AMAZING MOVIE IT'S ABOUT ARAGON RAISING HIS CHILDREN IN A REMOTE WOODLAND AREA PROBABLY FOR THEM TO BECOME RANGERS
THE SMILE AND LOOK LOOK AT THE END SOLD IT FOR ME
I CANT FOR THE LIFE OF ME REMEMBER THE SCENE WHERE THEY STAND RIGHT OUTSIDE THE WALL LIKE THAT
THIS EXACT PART WHERE THE CHUNKS OF STONE FLY UP IS POSSIBLY THE ONLY PART OF LOAR WHERE THE SPECIAL FX AREN'T EXACTLY ON POINT REMINDS ME OF THE GODZILLA STYLE STUFF POLYSTYRENE BLOCKS BEING THROWN AROUND
HEH
I'VE BEEN ON R YOUTUBEHAIKU TOO MUCH WAS EXPECTING ROUNDABOUT
R UNEXPECTEDJIHAD IS LEAKING AGAIN
I AM NO ARMY
THAT'S AWESOME
I BELIEVE MITHRAIC MINIATURES WAS AROUND FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE THE MOVIES
THERE WAS A COOL BOARD GAME CALLED QUEST OF THE MAGIC RING THAT CAME OUT IN IT'S PRETTY GOOD
THERE WAS A MIDDLE-EARTH COLLECTIBLE CARD GAME STARTED IN TO WHICH IS WHEN DECIPHER OBTAINED THE RIGHTS AND MADE THEIR TCG BASED OFF THE MOVIES
SURE NOWHERE NEAR AS MUCH LICENSED STUFF BEFORE BUT THERE WERE ITEMS LIKE PEWTER CHESS SETS AND SO FORTH FROM MEMORY

OF COURSE CALENDARS PRINTS THAT KIND OF THING EVEN THE ODD T SHIRT
TUDOR MINT MADE A HOBBIT AND LORD OF THE RINGS SERIES OF PEWTER FIGURINES

DO NOT DISTURB THE WATER
YOU'RE ROCKING A SUN BURN THERE TOO BAH
CHECK OUT THE SILMARILLION SECTION OF THE RINGS OF POWER AND THE THIRD AGE

THE ELDEN RINGS ARE TOOLS OF PRESERVATION AND WISDOM THEY KEEP SOME OF THE WONDER AND BEAUTY OF THE FIRST AGE AROUND THEM ELROD USES HIS TO ENHANCE AND PROTECT RIVENDELL GALADRIEL MAKES LOTHLORIEN WHAT IT IS WITH HERS IT ALSO GIVES HER HER MENTAL INSIGHT

GANDALF USES HIS RING TO KINDLE COURAGE AND INSPIRATION IN OTHERS

IF SARON HAD THE ONE HE COULD COMPLETELY CONTROL THE WEARERS OF THE THREE THEY'D HAVE TO TAKE THEM OFF AND STOP USING THEM


THE THREE ARE ELDEN RINGS AS MUCH AS THE SEVEN OR THE NINE THEY WERE ALL MADE FOR ELVES THE THREE WERE NOT INSTRUMENTS OF DOMINATION AND HAD A TWOFOLD FUNCTION THE ONE WAS TO BRING AMAN THE UNDYING LANDS TO MIDDLE-EARTH IN THEIR APPLICATION HENCE THE FEELING THAT LOTHLÓRIEN AND RIVENDELL WERE OUT OF TIME AND OUT OF PLACE FRODO FELT THAT HE WAS IN A TIMELESS LAND THAT DID NOT FADE OR CHANGE OR FALL INTO FORGETFULNESS LOTHLÓRIEN

THE ELVES WERE IMMORTAL SO LONG AS ARDA EXISTED THE ELVES HOWEVER WERE PLAGUED BY THE PROCESS OF FADING WHERE THEIR BODIES WOULD GROW WEAK AND DISINTEGRATE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT LONG ENDURE THEIR SPIRITS FELAGUND SPOKE OF HOW THE NOLUDAR WERE SEEING IT ALREADY AFTER HAVING RETURNED TO MIDDLE-EARTH

IT IS NOT OTHERWISE WITH THE QUENDA THEMSELVES THEIR HEALTH AND STATURE IS DIMINISHED ALREADY THOSE OF US WHO DWELL IN MIDDLE-EARTH AND EVEN WE WHO HAVE RETURNED TO IT FIND THAT THE CHANGE OF THEIR BODIES IS SWIFTER THAN IN THE BEGINNING AND THAT I JUDGE MUST FOREBODE THAT THEY WILL PROVE LESS STRONG TO LAST THAN THEY WERE DESIGNED TO BE THOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE CLEARLY REVEALED FOR MANY LONG YEARS DEBATE OF FIBROID AND WANDRETH

THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE MELIOR INGREDIENT IN ARDA HE HAD A TERRIBLE GRIP ON THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND HIS INFLUENCE TOUCHED A GREAT MANY THINGS BORN THEREFROM AS THE ELVES WERE TO MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM IS THE SECOND FUNCTION OF THE THREE THEY HELPED TO PRESERVE THE BODIES OF THE ELVES FROM BREAKING DOWN FROM FADING

WHAT IS THE WHOLE DEAL WITH ARWEN NOT BEING ABLE TO STAY IN MIDDLE EARTH IF SARON GETS THE RING

THIS IS NOT A THING ARWEN WAS NEVER AN ELF NOR HER BROTHERS THEY WERE MORTALS WHO WERE GIVEN LEAVE TO DELAY THEIR CHOICE UNTIL THEIR FATHER ELROD LEFT MIDDLE-EARTH IF THEY WENT WITH HIM TO AMAN THEY'D BECOME ELVES AS THEIR FATHER AND GRANDPARENTS HAD IF THEY CHOSE TO REMAIN IN MIDDLE-EARTH THEY WOULD REMAIN MORTAL AND SHARE IN THE DOOM OF MEN AS THEIR UNCLE ELROD DID

AND WHY WAS THEIR POWER ENDED WHEN THE RING WAS DESTROYED

ALL OF THE RINGS WERE BOUND TO THE ONE DUE TO THE RING LORE EXPOSITED TO THE ELVES BY SARON I THINK OF IT IN THIS WAY WITHOUT THEIR KNOWING THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE DESIGN OF THE RINGS THAT SARON INTRODUCED AS A MEANS TO CONNECT THEM AND EVENTUALLY THOSE TO A MASTER RING SOMEWHAT LIKE A BACKDOOR HE KEPT THEM IGNORANT OF IN ORDER FOR HIM TO INITIATE THIS CONNECTION TO THE ONE HE WAS FORCED TO PUT MORE THAN HALF OF HIS OWN NATIVE STRENGTH INTO THE ONE HIS PURPOSE WAS TO DOMINATE THE MINDS OF THE BEARERS OF THE RINGS VIA THE ONE

WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITH THEM IF SARON HAD RECLAIMED THE ONE

THEY WERE STILL ALL BOUND TO THE ONE THIS IS BORNE OUT FOR EXAMPLE IN DISCUSSION WITH FRODO IN LORIEN ABOUT THE ONE AND WHY HE AND NOT SAM COULD SEE HER RING HAD SARON REGAINED THE ONE HE WILL COMMAND THEM ALL AGAIN WHEREVER THEY BE EVEN THE THREE AND ALL THAT HAS BEEN WROUGHT WITH THEM WILL BE LAID BARE AND HE WILL BE STRONGER THAN EVER THE SHADOW OF THE PAST WHATEVER WAS WORKED WITH THE RINGS HE'D HAVE KNOWN AND HE'D ENSNARE THE MINDS OF THE BEARERS THIS WAS HIS GRAND DESIGN WHICH HE FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH THE FIRST TIME HAVING SUNG HIS RHYME AND THEREBY ALERTING THE ELVES TO HIS TREACHERY THEY TOOK OFF THE RINGS BEFORE THEY COULD BE ENSNARED AND HID THEM AND DID NOT WEAR THEM UNTIL THE ONE WAS LOST
HEY THANKS FOR POSTING THIS I'VE BEEN HOPING TO STUMBLE ACROSS A LOT PODCAST FOR BACKGROUND SOUND
YES JMS WAS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY TZOLKIN BUT THE VORLONS AND THE SHADOWS AREN'T SO MUCH LIKE ELVES THE MIMBAR WERE ACTUALLY HIS VERSION OF THE ELVES

THERE ARE HUGE DIFFERENCES SAVE FOR ONE CORRUPTED GOOD GUY SAURURAN BY THE TIME THE EVENTS OF LOAR TAKE PLACE GOOD AND EVIL HAVE LARGE SEPARATED THEMSELVES IN ON THE OTHER HAND YOU SEE THE SAME SEEDS OF HATRED IN THE ARN RISE UP IN THE CENTAURI AND THEN GOAD THEM INTO GENOCIDE OF THE BARNS EARTH GOV PROVES EVIL BUT MANY HUMANS ARE STILL GOOD I EAST THE ONES ON AND LONDO BECOMES QUITE RESPECTABLE WHICH IS A STARK CONTRAST TO GOLLUM WHO BECOMES TO THE GOOD GUYS BUT DOESN'T EVER HAVE A CHANGE OF HEART

LEARNED MAGIC IN MIDDLE-EARTH IS GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS SORCERY AND IS GENERALLY EVIL
UNFORTUNATELY TZOLKIN DOESN'T GIVE US A CLEAR ANSWER

IN THE SILMARILLION WIZARDS AND OTHER MAAR ARE CAPABLE OF USING MAGIC ELVES CAN ALSO WIELD MAGIC AND MADE OR HELPED MAKE MOST OF THE MAGIC ITEMS WE SEE IN LOAR LIKE THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL THE PALANTIRI THE SWORDS THAT GLOW IN THE PRESENCE OF ORCS DWARVES AND ANTS PROBABLY CAN NATURALLY USE MAGIC BUT I CAN'T THINK OF SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OFF OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

I THINK THAT THE ONLY EXAMPLES OF HUMAN MAGIC USERS WE GET ARE WORKING FOR SARON SO THEY MIGHT JUST BE GETTING MAGIC FROM HIM AND IT'S NOT REALLY THEIRS SO TO SPEAK OF COURSE IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SARON JUST TAUGHT THE NAGUAL TO USE MAGIC DURING THEIR LIFETIMES AND THE RINGS JUST ENHANCE TO USE POWERS

HOBBITS DON'T MESS AROUND WITH MAGIC

THEN THERE ARE WEIRD OUTLIERS LIKE TOM BOBADIL AND THE ALL OF WHOM CAN USE MAGIC OF SOME KIND BUT I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THEY REALLY ARE
I'D SAY BEHORN THE FROM THE HOBBIT WHOSE DESCENDANTS STILL LIVE DURING THE LORD OF THE RINGS PROBABLY COUNTS

WHILE THE EXACT NATURE AND ORIGIN OF HIS POWER IS UNKNOWN TZOLKIN WROTE OF HIM IN LETTER THAT HE WAS A AND NO DOUBT A BIT OF A MAGICIAN
TOM BOBADIL
ELVES LEARN FROM THE WORDS OF GALADRIEL
ELVES DEPENDING ON WHERE WHO AND WHY CAN DO STUFF LEARNED MAGIC IS USUALLY NOT A THING WE ASSUME THAT THE OF SORCERIES COMES FROM HIS RING BOBADIL AND GOLDENBERRY HAVE MAGICS BUT IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY ARE TALUKAS AND HIS CONSORT BEHORN CAN SHAPECHANGE MAAR LIKE BARONGS SARON AND INSTAR CAN JUST DO STUFF

MAGIC IN THE LOAR WORLD IS NOT A LEARNED THING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF RINGLORE EITHER YOU GET FROM AN ARTIFACT OR YOU CAN JUST DO IT FORGET IND OR OTHER SOURCES WIZARDS OR INSTAR ARE LITERALLY HEH HEH CAUSE IT IS IN A BOOK MAAR LESSER ANGELS IN A HUMAN BODY THEIR MAGIC IS THEM USING DIVINE POWER TO DO WHAT THEY CAN DO ELVES HEALING IS A MIX OF HERBAL KNOWLEDGE AND SOME WIERD DIVINE ABILITY THAT SOME ELVES CAN DO RINGLORE IS ONLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE SARON TAUGHT ELVES HOW TO EMBODY POWERS INTO RINGS BUT HE USED HIS OWN ABILITY TO CREATE THE LINK THAT BOUND THEM TO HIS MASTER RING

TZOLKIN WAS NEVER SUPER SPECIFIC ABOUT THOSE MECHANICS FOR AND I AM GUESSING HERE A GOOD REASON I THINK HE WANTED IT TO BE ENIGMATIC LIKE HIS DWARVES SO THAT THERE WERE MYSTERIES AND ENIGMAS IN HIS WORLD IT KEEPS YOU FROM KNOWING EVERYTHING SO MAGIC REMAINS A MYSTERIOUSLY POWERFUL ANCIENT FORCE THAT WE DON'T OR CAN'T COMPREHEND JUST WHAT IT IS OR WHAT IT CAN DO MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN HEY THIS IS HOW IT WORKS X Y Z ETC
WE KNOW OTHER CREATURES SUCH AS HOUSE ELVES HAVE ACCESS TO MAGICAL ABILITIES
IF YOU ENJOYED THAT YOU WILL ENJOY THIS
FOR MOBILE
THIS IS QUITE GOOD HALACHA
VERY NICE EDITING THERE

DORMAMMU I'VE COME TO BARGAIN
THAT GAVE ME A MUCH NEEDED CHUCKLE
YOU LOSE A FEW FRAMES FOR SOMETHING
BIG BROTHER AND LITTLE BROTHER
OR NED KEEPS PUSHING ARYA
GIVE THEM A MOMENT FOR SAKE
ISILDUR HAD THE RING BEFORE GOLLUM HE CUT IT FROM HAND ACCORDING TO WHAT LITTLE THERE IS TO GO ON HE WASN'T CORRUPTED BY IT BUT HE WAS BETRAYED BY IT

PLANT WAS THE ONE THAT WAS INTO TZOLKIN THE OTHERS NOT SO MUCH I THINK IN THE CASE OF RAMBLE ON THE GIRL IN QUESTION IS SIMPLY THAT A GIRL A COMMON SUBJECT IN ZEPPELIN LYRICS
DECAGON HAD THE RING BEFORE GOLLUM OR SMEAGOL
IT WAS FUNNY AT FIRST BUT IT BECAME A PEEKABOO TRIBUTE
I KNOW THIS SUBREDDIT IS MEANT TO BE POLITICS FREE BUT THIS SCENE HAS BECOME SUDDENLY MORE RELATABLE AS OF LATE
I JUST ABOUT DIED LAUGHING MY WIFE TELLS ME I'M JUVENILE
I FEEL IT IN THE WATER

I DIED
OH GOD THAT'S HYSTERICAL
I LOVE THIS ONE WASNT THE STAR THAT HE SAW EÄRENDIL
DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE PASSAGE AND IT LARGELY INSPIRED ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENES IN THE MOVIES

I CAN T DO THIS IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL

I KNOW IT S ALL WRONG BY RIGHTS WE SHOULDN T EVEN BE HERE BUT WE ARE IT S LIKE IN THE GREAT STORIES MR FRODO THE ONES THAT REALLY MATTERED FULL OF DARKNESS AND DANGER THEY WERE AND SOMETIMES YOU DIDN T WANT TO KNOW THE END BECAUSE HOW COULD THE END BE HAPPY HOW COULD THE WORLD GO BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS WHEN SO MUCH BAD HAD HAPPENED

BUT IN THE END IT S ONLY A PASSING THING THIS SHADOW EVEN DARKNESS MUST PASSIVE A NEW DAY WILL COME AND WHEN THE SUN SHINES IT WILL SHINE OUT THE CLEARER THOSE WERE THE STORIES THAT STAYED WITH YOU THAT MEANT SOMETHING EVEN IF YOU WERE TOO SMALL TO UNDERSTAND WHY BUT I THINK MR FRODO I DO UNDERSTAND I KNOW NOW FOLK IN THOSE STORIES HAD LOTS OF CHANCES OF TURNING BACK ONLY THEY DIDN TENSE THEY KEPT GOING BECAUSE THEY WERE HOLDING ON TO SOMETHING

WHAT ARE WE HOLDING ON TO SAM

THAT THERE S SOME GOOD IN THIS WORLD MR FRODO AND IT S WORTH FIGHTING FOR

ALSO MY FAVORITE XKCD
I THOUGHT FOR SURE I WAS GOING TO CLICK AND SEE

I WISH IT NEED NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN MY TIME SAID FRODO

SO DO I SAID GANDALF AND SO DO ALL WHO LIVE TO SEE SUCH TIMES BUT THAT IS NOT FOR THEM TO DECIDE ALL WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHAT TO DO WITH THE TIME THAT IS GIVEN US
THAT'S MINE TOO
EXCELLENT QUOTE
NOW YOU'VE TRIGGERED MY LOAR BOOKS NOSTALGIA
I ALSO LOVE THAT PASSAGE JUST BECAUSE IS THE BEST REASON TO POST LOAR QUOTES
WATCH THE LORD OF THE RINGS FIRST WATCH THE HOBBIT IF YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT BUT WATCH THE EXTENDED EDITION OF ALL THE MOVIES IF YOU CAN

IF YOU DECIDE TO READ THE BOOKS READ THE HOBBIT FIRST THE BOOK IS NOT A PREQUEL IT'S AN INDEPENDENT BOOK WRITTEN BEFORE THE LORD OF THE RINGS
AHH MY DEAR FRIEND WHAT I WOULD GIVE TO BE IN YOUR POSITION
DON'T START WITH THE HOBBIT THEY WERE MADE ASSUMING YOU HAD SEEN THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY WITH SEVERAL NODS TO THEM

WATCH LOAR IT'S AMAZING DON'T WATCH THE HOBBIT TRILOGY FIRST AS IT MAY PUT YOU OFF WATCHING LOAR OR COLOUR YOUR VIEW OF THEM
IF YOU WANT THE COMPLETE TZOLKIN STORY FROM BEGINNING TO END WATCH THE HOBBIT TRILOGY THEN WATCH LOAR TRILOGY

IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A STORY THAT GOES FROM LIGHT TO DARK WITH ACTION SIMILAR TO PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN WATCH THE HOBBIT TRILOGY

IF YOU WANT TO WATCH A MORE SERIOUS STORY THAT STARTS DARK AND GETS DARKER WITH ACTION SIMILAR TO BIG ACTION SEQUENCES SIMILAR TO TROY WATCH THE LOAR TRILOGY

IF YOU LOVE WHAT YOU SAW FROM BOTH GO BACK AND WATCH EXTENDED EDITION IT GIVES YOU A LOT MORE BACK STORY AND LORE
THE LOAR MOVIES ARE FAR BETTER THAN THE HOBBIT I'D START WITH THEM PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE IMPORTANT BACK STORY FROM THE HOBBIT IS EXPLAINED IN THE LOAR FILMS SO YOU AREN'T GONNA MISS OUT ON ANYTHING IF YOU LIKE LOAR THEN DEFINITELY GO ON TO WATCH THE HOBBIT THEY AREN'T BAD BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION BUT THEY PALE IN COMPARISON TO LOAR IF YOU DO DECIDE TO READ THE BOOKS FIRST YOU CAN STILL START WITH LOAR BUT I'D RECOMMEND STARTING WITH THE HOBBIT
HAVE YOU READ THE BOOKS AND OR KNOW THE STORY IF NO THEN DEFINITELY THE HOBBIT TRILOGY FIRST AS THE CHARACTER FATES WILL ACTUALLY BE SUSPENSEFUL RATHER THAN THAT GUY IS IN LOAR SO HE'S NOT IN DANGER
IF NOT THEN MPH WHATEVER YOU WANT REALLY
I WOULD READ THE HOBBIT BEFORE YOU WATCH THE HOBBIT MOVIES THEY MAY NOT BE BAD MOVIES BUT THEY ARE A FAR CRY FROM THE PLOT AND MESSAGE OF THE BOOK I PERSONALLY WATCHED THE MOVIES BEFORE I READ THE BOOK AND IT KIND OF RUINED THE BOOK FOR ME AS I ALREADY HAD AN IMAGE IN MY HEAD OF MANY THINGS IT LIMITED MY IMAGINATION WHILE READING
YOU COULD WATCH LOAR WITHOUT READING WATCHING THE HOBBIT BUT DEFINITELY READ THE HOBBIT BEFORE YOU WATCH THE MOVIES
I LOVE LORD OF RINGS MOVIES
I DONT LOVE THE HOBBIT MOVIES I DONT EVEN REALLY LIKE THEM
DON'T WATCH THE HOBBIT

IMO
I'D AVOID HOBBIT ALL TOGETHER
I THINK THE LOAR TRILOGY WILL INSPIRE YOU TO WATCH THEM ALL WHILE THE HOBBIT MOVIES MIGHT JUST KILL THAT VIBE LOAR FIRST HOBBIT SECOND LOAR EXTENDED VERSIONS IF YOU CAN HANDLE LOOING MOVIES AND THIS VERSION OF THE HOBBIT INSTEAD OF THE TRILOGY
LOAR THAN THE HOBBIT FOR MOVIES AND I RECOMMEND THE BOOKS READ HOBBIT FIRST
DON'T WATCH THE HOBBIT WATCH LOAR
I THINK IT'S FINE TO WATCH THE HOBBIT FIRST HOWEVER BE AWARE THERE ARE A FEW CONTINUITY PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE TWO TRILOGIES AND THESE ARE MORE APPARENT WHEN TOU WATCH BACK TO BACK BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER TO END ON ASTRON NOTE
SHIT THERE ARE SOME DROLLISH RESPONSES IN THIS THREAD

I WOULD PERSONALLY PREFER TO READ THE BOOKS FIRST BUT IF YOU ARE GOING FOR THE MOVIES THE LOAR MOVIES ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE HOBBIT MOVIES YOU'LL UNDERSTAND LOAR WITHOUT WATCHING THE HOBBIT MOVIES SINCE THE LOAR MOVIES EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE SO IF YOU WATCH THE LOAR MOVIES YOU WON'T HAVE TO WATCH THE FILTH THAT IS THE HOBBIT MOVIES

MY OPINION I MASSIVELY PREFER THE BOOKS OVER THE MOVIES BUT I FEEL THE LOAR MOVIES ARE QUITE GOOD AS MOVIES THE HOBBIT MOVIES MPH
I WOULD WATCH THE HOBBIT FIRST BECAUSE IT STARTS LIGHT AND GETS A LITTLE DARK LOAR IS DARK MOST OF THE TIME I THINK IT WOULD BE A BIT JARRING TO GO FROM THE DARK SERIOUSNESS OF RETURN OF THE KING TO THE FIRST HOBBIT MOVIE
BRILLIANT BUT ONLY COUNTS AS ONE
WHAT DO YOUR ELF EYES SEE
WOULD BE A SHAME IF IT WERE DESTROYED BECAUSE SOMEONE STOOD ON IT
WAY TO BE AN ASSHOLE PLEASE STOP VISITING STATE AND NATIONAL PARKS
ISN'T IT RECOMMENDED TO NOT STEP ON SUCH STRUCTURES TO AVOID DAMAGING THEM
WHERE IS THIS UTAH
WHO WILL THEY BLAME IF IT FALLS
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN UP THERE I THINK THAT THING LOOKS FRAGILE
DID YOU SLIDE DOWN ITS SNOUT
GUY STANDING ON ROCK

IF THIS IS ALL IT TAKES I'M ABOUT TO FLOOD THIS SUB WITH QUALITY POSTS

YOU FORGOT TO HIT HIM WITH ARROWS
SHOULD YOU BE CAPTAIN KIRK
WATCH V E
COOBOO
BRAVO
THESE TESSELLATIONS ARE HARD TO MAKE I'VE TRIED I LOVE MC ESCHER WORK TOO


THIS IS GREAT WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE SUCH ARTICLE
ALWAYS LOVED THIS PART BOTH IN THE BOOKS AND THE MOVIE
ALTHOUGH I WAS KINDA BUMMED THEY DIDN'T HAVE GLORFINDEL IN THE MOVIES SUCH A BADASS
I'VE HAD SOME FAIRLY LONG ARGUMENTS ON THE TOPIC BEFORE HAND BUT I'M RUNNING LOW ON TIME SO I WON'T GO INTO TERRIBLE DETAIL RIGHT NOW

THE QUICK ANSWER IS I BELIEVE THE FIRST MOVIE IS AT IT'S CORE A PRETTY DECENT MOVIE WITH A FEW BAD PARTS

THE SECOND MOVIE IS A FUNDAMENTALLY BAD MOVIE WITH A FEW DECENT PARTS

THERE IS NO MOVIE IN THE ENTIRETY OF PUBLISHED FILM THAT I DESPISE AS VEHEMENTLY AS THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES NOT ONLY DOES IT FAIL SPECTACULARLY WHEN CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION TO SAY ONLY AS A MOVIE BUT IT TAKES A GIANT STEAMING SHIT ON THE SOURCE MATERIAL IT BELIES NOT ONLY A COMPLETE INABILITY OF THE CREATORS TO UNDERSTAND THE BOOK BUT ALSO A COMPLETE INDIFFERENCE ON THEIR PART TO ANY SEMBLANCE OF CREATING A STORY WITH A SIMILAR TONE OR THEME THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS A GODDAMN TRAVESTY THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED
UNPLEASANT MOVIES TO WATCH BUT WITH SOME VERY INTERESTING MOMENTS WHEN THE POINTLESS ACTION SCENES PAUSED FOR A SECOND

EAST G BALIN TALKING TO THORIN IN HOUSE ABOUT HOW THEY DIDN'T NEED TO GO TO THE CONLEY MOUNTAIN BECAUSE THORIN HAD ALREADY GIVEN THEM A GOOD LIFE

OR THE EXPANSION OF THE DWARVES INTO CHARACTERS

OR MAKING THE DWARVES SYMPATHETIC

BUT I'LL NEVER FORGIVE WHAT THEY MADE SMUG INTO A BUMBLING POMPOUS IDIOT

CHECK OUT THE MAPLE EDIT OF ALL THREE MOVIES INTO ONE SHORTER ONE ITS BASICALLY SEAMLESS AND LEAVES MOST OF THE CHAFF SOLO ADVENTURE RADAGAST THE ROMANCE AND MUCH OF THE POINTLESS ACTION ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR
GO GET THE MAPLE FILMS EDIT SOOOOOO GOOD PRETTY MUCH THE BEST VERSION OF THE HOBBIT WE COULD GET TOTALLY CHANGED MY VIEWING EXPERIENCE NOW I CAN WATCH THAT THEN THE LOAR TRILOGY AND HAVE A WONDERFUL MIDDLE-EARTH WEEKEND
I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF WATCHING THE HOBBIT MOVIES AND NOW I'M PLAYING THROUGH LEGO THE HOBBIT AND LOVING IT AS WELL THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I CAN'T IMAGINE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THOSE MOVIES COULD BE BETTER ALSO THEY MAKE EVERY SCENE IN THE ORIGINAL LOAR TRILOGY LOOK LIKE MASTERFUL WORKS OF ART BY COMPARISON
PETER JACKSON MILKED THE HOBBIT PAINFULLY ALL FOR GOLD SADLY AND HE MADE RADAGAST INTO A CLOWN FIR SHAME
THEYRE GOOD QUALITY MOVIES IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY ASPECT FROM THE MUSIC THE SET THE MAKE UP THE ACTING ETC THEY ARE A FUN INTERPRETATION OF THE BOOK AND IF YOU DONT GET ALL BUTT HURT ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DETAIL THEN THEY CAN BE VERY ENJOYABLE
SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN THREE MOVIES ONE MAYBE TWO
PLEASE DOWNVOTE APPROPRIATELY NOTICED A FEW DISAGREEING OPINIONS IT'S BETTER TO DOWNVOTE A TROLL THAN SOMEONE WITH A DIFFERENT OPINION
THE HOBBIT MOVIES WERE ABSOLUTE GARBAGE
MY ONLY INPUT HERE IS THAT I ACTUALLY PREFER THE DVDS TO THE BLUEJAYS I THINK THE CGI SHOWS ITS AGE IN HD TO A GREATER DEGREE ESPECIALLY IN FOR KILLS IMMERSION A BIT WHEN YOU CAN TELL THAT CHARACTERS ARE ANIMATED IN MASS SCENES
ADAMIK THE QUALITY IN TERMS OF RESOLUTION CLARITY AND DETAIL IS SLIGHTLY BETTER IN THE EE BUT THERE IS A COLOR DIFFERENCE IN THE EE FOR WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE A GREEN TINT THAT PERMEATES THROUGH THE ENTIRE MOVIE NOW I'M A BIT OF A QUALITY FREAK BUT THE COLOR OF THE EE FELLOWSHIP DOESN'T BOTHER ME BECAUSE I SIMPLY NEVER WATCHED THE HD THEATRICAL VERSION YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCES IF YOU GOOGLE FOR FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING GREEN TINT

I CARE MUCH MORE ABOUT THE EXTENDED EDITIONS THAN SOME CREATIVE DECISION PERTAINING TO THE MOVIE'S COLOR THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN INTENTIONAL SO I WOULDN'T STRESS TOO MUCH ABOUT IT
IT'S SO BAD THAT I ACTUALLY LAUGHED A BIT
THAT'S GREAT HAHA
ONE THING I MIGHT CHANGE IS SAY A RING WRAITH WALKS INTO A BAR THAT WAY THE PUNCHLINE HITS A LITTLE HARDER
I DON'T GET IT
I CRINGED SO HARD I HIT ORBIT

THEN I LAUGHED TAKE AN UPDATE YOU BASTARD
I FEEL LIKE THIS COULD GO ON R DADJOKES LOL
MY DAD WALKED ME DOWN THE AISLE DRESSED AS GANDALF
DON'T USE A SYMBOL OF EVIL AND DOMINATION AS YOUR WEDDING RING

ALSO SEARCH THIS HISTORY TONNES OF PEOPLE HAVE TRIED THIS BEFORE
I BOUGHT A PLAQUE FOR THE BRIDAL OR GIFT TABLE WITH QUOTE

I WOULD RATHER SPEND ONE LIFE TIME WITH YOU THAN FACE ALL OF THE AGES OF THIS WORLD ALONE
BOUTONNIERE MADE FROM A PAGE OF LOAR STILL MY LINK SUBMISSION BUT THAT'S NOT EXACTLY A HARD RECORD TO HAVE AS I MOSTLY COMMENT
NOT MY ACTUAL WEDDING BUT ON MY 8TH ISH ANNIVERSARY I TOOK MY WIFE'S NAME MELISSA TRANSLATED THE GREEK HONEY BEE AND TRANSLATED THAT MEANING TO QUENDA MAYBE SINDARIN IT'S BEEN A WHILE AND WROTE IT IN ELVISH AND USED IT IN A POEM LETTER TO HERALDRY

PS HONEY BEE IN ELVISH ISN'T AS CUTE AS MELISSA
HOW WILL I

I WANT TO BE MARRIED OUTSIDE UNDER THE TREES AND IF I CAN FIND SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE WILLING DRESSED AS BEDEN AND LUTHIER

PICK THE RING CAREFULLY
OUR SWEETHEART TABLE HAD A FRAMED MAP OF MIDDLE-EARTH ON IT AND A FRIEND OF MINE MUCH MORE WELL VERSED IN THE LANGUAGES THAN I AM GAVE US THE QUENDA TENGWAR SCRIPT FOR BELOVED LORD AND BELOVED LADY WHICH THE MAID OF HONOR THEN INSCRIBED ON OUR TOASTING GLASSES
NO THE RING IS A PART OF SARON IT DOES NOT ENHANCE HIS POWER ONLY CONTROLS THE WEEK MORGORTH IS A HIGHER BEING AND EVEN WHEN ALL THE BEINGS ON HIS SAME LEVEL CAME TOGETHER THEY COULD BE ARMY DEFEAT HIM
EDORA

ALSO THE HALL OF THE KING IS MEDUSELD NOT THE MARK


THE MARK IS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IT IS AN OLD-FASHIONED WORD FOR MARCH A BORDER REGION IN THIS CASE OF CONDOR SO THE RIDDERMARK IS BASICALLY THE MARCH OR MARCH THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PLACES NAMED AFTER A MARCH TODAY FOR EXAMPLE DENMARK MARCH OF THE DANES

BUT FOR ROHAN THE CAPITAL IS CALLED EDORA AND THE HOUSE OF THRODDEN IS CALLED MEDUSELD OR THE GOLDEN HALL
THE MARK CIRC IS SHORT FOR RIDDERMARK WHICH IS ROHAN ITSELF YOU'RE THINKING OF THE HALL MEDUSELD IN THE CITY OF EDORA
JEALOUS
WHERE DID YOU GET IT
IF YOU WANT A 1ST EDITION 1ST PRINTING IT CAN BE YOURS FOR THE LOW LOW PRICE OF

ITM 1ST EDITION 1ST HASH ITEM G GVEAAOSWD
SORRY EVERYONE IT'S ACTUALLY THE IMPRESSION
THIS LOOKS AMAZING
BOOKS ARE SOME OF THE MOST WIDELY READ FICTION AND FANTASY BOOKS SO GOOD CHOICE OK THEY ARE MY FAVOURITE BOOKS

I WOULDN'T PUT MUCH STOCK IN THE DIFFERENT LOAR WIKIS THAT EXIST THEY OFTEN GET STUFF EITHER A BIT WRONG OR COMPLETELY WRONG

SHORT EXPLANATION THE ORIGIN STORY OF ARDA THE WORLD WHERE MIDDLE-EARTH IS IS THAT ERU ILÚVATAR GOD CREATED THE AINU A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND TOGETHER THEY CREATED THE WORLD SARON IS ONE OF THOSE ORIGINAL SPIRITS THAT WENT ROGUE

BUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS DON'T REALLY KNOW THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN WORLD I THINK IT'S BEST TO JUST READ THE BOOKS IN ORDER THE HOBBIT LORD OF THE RINGS APPENDICES AND THEN MOVE ON TO THE SILMARILLION THE SILMARILLION HAS ORIGIN STORIES FOR A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE MENTIONED IN LOAR AND THEN READ LOAR AGAIN THIS TIME WITH MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN MOST OF THE CHARACTERS HAVE ON THE FIRST READING YOU LEARN ALONG WITH THE CHARACTERS
HE IS BASICALLY A FALLEN ANGEL CREATED BY GOD AND WANTED TO CHALLENGE GOD WHICH PRESUMABLY IS ALL A PART OF GODS PLAN ANYWAYS
THIS IS MY VERY SKETCH VERY BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE SILMARILLION WHICH IS A REAL JOY IF YOU WANT TO READ IT SOMEDAY

SO SARON IS A MAAR IF WE'RE GOING IN TIERS HE'S RIGHT UNDER THE ALAR WHICH ARE THE GODS THINK GREEK MYTHOLOGY GODS CREATED BY THE ONE GOD ILUVATAR SO ILUVATAR ALAR MAAR

ORIGINALLY THE BIG BAD WAS MELIOR ONE OF THE ORIGINAL ALAR AFTER ILUVATAR CREATED THE ALAR THEY ALL JOINED TOGETHER SINGING A SONG TO CREATE THE UNIVERSE ALL OF THEIR SONGS DID DIFFERENT THEMES BUT THEY WERE ALL IN TUNE AND THEN MELIOR CAME ALONG AND DECIDED TO SING HIS OWN TUNE WHICH BASICALLY WOVE EVIL INTO THE FABRIC OF THE UNIVERSE BUT THEN ILUVATAR SAID NO I'M GOING TO WORK HIS EVIL THEME INTO SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE MY MUSIC EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL IT'S PRETTY GREAT SO THEN BASICALLY WHAT FOLLOWED IS MELIOR NOW NAMED MORGOTH BASICALLY WAGING A LONG WAR AGAINST THE ALAR AND ALL THEIR CREATIONS SCREWING WITH THE ELVES MEN DWARVES SENDING GIANT SPIDERS TO EAT THE SUN AND MOON STEALING JEWELS ETC SARON WAS HIS LIEUTENANT EVENTUALLY HE GOT TAKEN DOWN BY THE ALAR BUT LATER ON SARON DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A CULT FOR MORGOTH AND SET HIMSELF UP AS HIS REPRESENTATIVE THIS CULT WAS BASED ON OFFERING MEN IMMORTALITY IN EXCHANGE FOR HUMAN SACRIFICE FUN

SO THINGS ESCALATED FROM THERE BUT I THINK THAT COVERS HIS BACKSTORY A REAL WINNER THAT GUY
THE DNC PUT FORWARD A WEAK CANDIDATE WITH TIES TO WALL STREET AND THE DISILLUSIONED WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTED AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT
THIS IS THE BEST EXPLANATION I'VE FOUND WITHOUT READING THE OTHER MATERIAL

THE LORD OF THE RINGS MYTHOLOGY EXPLAINED
ANALYSIS OF TRACK 2 CONCERNING HOBBITS

FIRST WE HAVE AN INTRODUCTION GIVEN BY THE CELLOS AND BASSOONS TO SET THE HOBBIT MOOD NOTICE THAT IN MOST OF THE OTHER TRACKS THE LOW
STRINGS WHEN PLAYED BY THEMSELVES GIVE A KIND OF FOREBODING HERE BY PLAYING THEM STACCATO DETACHED AND PLAYING WHICH IS
TONAL IT GIVES IT A MORE PLAYFUL SOUND THE NUMBERS REFER TO THE NOTES OF THE SCALE IF YOU ARE IN C THEN C IS D IS 2 E IS AND SO FORTH
AT THE TIN WHISTLE I BELIEVE GIVES US THEME WHEN HE SAYS IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU GANDALF NOTICE THAT IT IS PLAYED LIGHT AND
AIRY IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS LITTLE BASS AND COMPLETELY TONAL THIS IS DEFINITELY OUR HAPPY FRODO THE THEME ALSO HAS MANY ORNAMENTATIONS SUCH
AS GRACE NOTES AND SLIDES WHICH IS A FOLK DERIVATIVE THE HIGH STRINGS TAKE OVER THE CELLO PART WHICH HELPS MAINTAIN A STEADY BUT VERY SUBTLE
BEAT ALMOST ALL OF THE TRACKS HAVE A LOT OF DISSONANCE IN THEM AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS SO TONAL MAKES THE MUSIC SEEM VERY FOLK LIKE THE
HARMONY IS ALSO QUITE SIMPLE IN ITS FORM
THIS TIME AT THE BASSOONS PLAY THE INTRO BY THEMSELVES THIS IS WHERE FRODO ASKS ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD
AT A SOLO VIOLIN PLAYS THE FOLK LIKE MELODY EACH NOTE IS VERY ATTACHED TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A FIDDLE WHICH IS A FOLK INSTRUMENT A
HARPSICHORD IS ADDED PLAYING THE NOTES OF EACH CHORD ONE AT A TIME TO GIVE A VERY SIMPLE ACCOMPANIMENT THE FACT THAT HS USED HARPSICHORD
INSTEAD OF PIANO MAKES IT SEEM EVEN MORE FOLK LIKE AND DETACHED A PIANO HITS THE STRINGS AND A HARPSICHORD PLUCKS THEM THE STRINGS ALSO
DO WHAT I CALL A WHICH IS ALSO VERY SIMPLE IN IT'S FORM AND GIVES A KIND OF HUMOR TO THE MUSIC THIS IS
WHERE GANDALF SAYS WELL WHAT CAN I TELL YOU AND YOU SEE HOBBITON FOR THE FIRST TIME
AT WE HEAR A VERSION OF THEME AGAIN WHILE WE SEE THE MARKET PLACE AT HOBBITON THE MUSIC IS VERY LEGATO OPPOSITE OF DETACHED AND
THE CONTRAST MAKES THIS SECTION SEEM VERY WARM AND INVITING HOWEVER YOU CAN STILL HEAR THE HARPSICHORD STILL PLAYING ITS DETACHED NOTES IN
THE BACKGROUND TO CONTINUE THE HAPPY PLAYFUL SIDE OF THE HOBBITS
AT THE SOLO VIOLIN ENTERS AGAIN AS WE SEE THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY BILBO BAGGIES SIGN RAISED THE MUSIC ALSO RAISES IN PITCH TO HELP THE
EXPECTATION OF THE PARTY THIS DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG SINCE GANDALF CHANGES THE SUBJECT TO BILBO AT
HERE THE MUSIC CHANGES TO A MORE SERIOUS TONE A PREMONITION PERHAPS THERE IS NO TUNE UNTIL JUST HELD CHORDS BY THE STRINGS
IT'S LIKE THE PLAYFULNESS OF THE HOBBITS PAUSED FOR A MOMENT OF FOREBODING HOWEVER THERE IS STILL NO DISSONANCE HERE
OF COURSE IT DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG BECAUSE AT FRODO CHANGES THE SUBJECT AND TELLS GANDALF THAT HE CAN KEEP HIS SECRETS AND THE
AND HARPSICHORD RETURNS THEN HE SAYS WHATEVER YOU DID YOU'VE BEEN OFFICIALLY LABELED AS A DISTURBER OF THE
PEACE WHICH IS RIGHT ON HERE THE VIOLINS PLAY EVEN MORE STACCATO ANY MORE AND I DON'T THINK THE NOTE WOULD EXIST WITH THE
ADDITION OF THE FLUTE TO GIVE IT AS MUCH OF A HUMOROUS TONE QUALITY AS POSSIBLE AS THE GRUMPY OLD HOBBIT GIVES GANDALF THE GRIM LOOK
THEN WE SEE THE COUNTRYSIDE AGAIN WITH THE YOUNG HOBBITS RUNNING TOWARD CART AT THEME COMES BACK PLAYED VERY LYRICALLY
AGAIN TO GIVE US THE WARM FUZZY HOBBIT FEELING
AT THE HOBBIT CHILDREN CHEER FOR THE FIREWORKS AND WE GET THE INTERACTION WITH THE GRUMPY HOBBIT AND HIS WIFE THE MUSIC RETURNS TO THE LIGHT
AND DETACHED THEME TO SAY THAT THIS IS FUNNY I THINK THE WIFE'S GLARE HAPPENS AT THE SILENCE AT
AT AS FRODO SAYS GANDALF I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK HIS THEME RETURNS SO WE CAN END WITH THE WARM BUZZIES AS GANDALF PULLS UP TO BAG END

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
WOULD HE REGAIN HIS PHYSICAL FORM LIKE IN THE WAR OF THE LAST ALLIANCE

SARON ALREADY HAS PHYSICAL FORM AT THE TIME OF LOAR HE DOESN'T NEED THE RING TO DO IT

WOULD IT JUST FUEL THE ARMIES OF MORDOR ENOUGH TO TAKE OVER MIDDLE EARTH

THE RING IS A TOOL TO DOMINATE THE MINDS OF OTHERS ESPECIALLY THE MINDS OF THE HOLDERS OF THE RINGS OF POWER GANDALF GALADRIEL AND ELROD WOULD HAVE TO STOP USING THEIR RINGS OR THEY WOULD BECOME SLAVES OF SARON HE COULD ALSO USE IT TO DOMINATE THE MINDS OF OTHER LEADERS PEOPLE MAKING IT THAT MUCH EASIER TO RULE MIDDLE EARTH

WOULD LITERALLY ANY OF THE HUMANS WHO SIDED WITH MORDOR SURVIVE OR DID WOULD THEY ALL GET SCREWED OVER

LIKELY HE WOULD KEEP THEM AS SLAVES OR VASSALS SARON IS ABOUT CONTROL NOT NIHILISTIC DESTRUCTION THAT'S MORGOTH

I ASK BECAUSE IT SEEMS SARON IS ALREADY DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO TAKE OVER THE FREE WORLD HE'S GOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GOBLINS TROLLS AND OTHER MONSTROSITIES AT HIS COMMAND THE WORLD OF MEN IS TOTALLY DIVIDED AND WEAK WHAT'S HE REALLY NEED THE RING FOR I UNDERSTAND SHIT WOULD HIT THE FAN BUT I JUST DON'T SEE THE PLAN EXACTLY I REALLY ONLY SEE THE RING REGARDED AS THIS INSANELY POWERFUL WEAPON BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY PROTECT SARON FROM A SWORD SWING AND IT HARDLY PROTECTS ISILDUR GOLLUM OR FRODO IN THEIR POSSESSION OF IT WHAT IS IT GOING TO DO

I THINK I ADDRESSED THIS SUFFICIENTLY ABOVE THE RING IS NOT A CONVENTIONAL WEAPON AND SARON IS NOT A GREAT WARRIOR HE'S A MANIPULATOR

I'LL ADD THIS SARON HAS BASICALLY ALREADY WON HE HAS THE BIGGEST ARMIES BEST POSITION ETC HIS FEAR IS THAT SOMEONE WILL USE THE RING AGAINST HIM TO ENHANCE THEIR OWN POWER AND USE ITS DOMINATION TO RAISE AN ARMY AND STRIKE HIM DOWN BECOMING KING THEMSELVES HE'S WORRIED ABOUT ARAGON GANDALF GALADRIEL AND ELROD THE LATTER THREE LIKELY HAVE THE STRENGTH TO WRENCH THE RING TO THEIR OWN CONTROL BUT THEY WOULD STILL BECOME EVIL BECAUSE IT'S A TOOL THAT DOES EVIL THINGS REMEMBER SPEECH ABOUT TAKING THE RING

THAT'S WHY SARON IS DESPERATELY SEEKING IT BECAUSE HE COULD LOSE IF SOMEONE SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL USED IT HE SHOULD BE WORRIED THAT SOMEONE WILL TRY TO DESTROY IT BUT IT DOESN'T ENTER HIS WILDEST DREAMS THAT THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT IS FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW TACTICALLY STUPID

E THE CHAPTER THE COUNCIL OF ELROD EXPLAINS THIS MUCH BETTER THAN I CAN
I THINK THEY DELIBERATELY LEFT IT OUT OF THE MOVIES BECAUSE HAVING A GOOD GUY LIKE GANDALF ADMIT TO WHAT IS BASICALLY TORTURE WOULD BE A BIT IFFY THEY ALSO LEFT OUT HIS
IT WOULD BE COOL BUT IAN MCKELLAN IS AGING AND PLAYING A MAJOR ROLE IN SOMETHING LIKE THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS VERY TIRING
IT'S NOT EXPRESSLY STATED BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK HE REMAINED IN THAT FORM UNTIL HE DIED AGAIN AND RETURNED TO ALIENOR IN HIS MAIA FORM
CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG BUT WASNT IT SO THAT GALADRIEL GANDALF FRODO ETC WENT TO TOL EGRESSED INSTEAD OF ALIENOR
I WAS HOPING PETER JACKSON WOULD DIRECT AND THE MOVIES WOULD BE LONGER THAN ACTUAL LIFE SPANISH
NOW WE ARE TZOLKIN
FOR ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT SERVICE I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BOOK TZOLKIN AND THE GREAT WAR THE THRESHOLD OF MIDDLE-EARTH BY JOHN GARTH


JUST THROW SOME MAKEUP ON GARY OLDMAN
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE TZOLKIN SURF DOWN A TRENCH ON AN SHIELD BEFORE LAUNCHING IT AND IMPALING AN AXIS SOLDIER
ANOTHER ONE I DON'T WANT TO COMPLAIN BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHERS TZOLKIN AND LEWIS HAS SUPPOSEDLY BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT FOR YEARS NOW AND THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE I CAN'T REMEMBER POSSIBLY SIMPLY TITLED TZOLKIN THEN THERE WAS THE LION AWAKES BUT I BELIEVE THAT WAS INDEED CANCELLED AND THE WRITERS MOVED ON TO CREATE SOMETHING PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL CALLED JACK TOLLERS BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE AN INDIE FILM THAT HASN'T GOT OFF THE GROUND AND THAT ADAPTATION KIRKWOOD I FEEL LIKE THESE IDEAS KEEP CREEPING UP BUT NOTHING REALLY COMES OF IT
YOU'D THINK SIX YEARS OF RESEARCH WOULD ENABLE SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY CALL IT MIDDLE-EARTH INSTEAD OF MIDDLE EARTH
LIFE MATTERS
TZOLKIN TO BE PLAYED BY RAMI MALEK
WHAT ARE FOLKS THOUGHTS ON WHO WOULD BE BEST TO PLAY HIM AT THIS POINT
AWESOME
JONATHAN PRYCE PLEASE CAST HIM
THIS WILL PROBABLY KILL CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN AND THEN PETER JACKSON CAN DIRECT THE SILMARILLION
I HOPE THEY DELVE INTO HIS LITTLE ALLEGORY FETISH
THE CORRECT PHRASING AT THE END SHOULD BE

OOOOONNNNEEEE GOLDEN RING
THE KING OF THE NAGUAL KOAN FINGERED THE SAFETY BUCKLE THAT SECURED THE SHORT-SWORD IN IT'S SCABBARD IT WAS MODELED AFTER THE GLADIUS DESIGN MAKING IT WHOLLY INADEQUATE FOR GOING UP AGAINST ELDEN ARMOUR BUT IT WAS PERFECTLY SUITED FOR BEING JAMMED IN THE COLLARBONE OF A HOBBIT MERC WITHOUT CALLING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO IT'S OWNER HIS XO CAMEL KHAMAL HAD USED A SIMILAR WEAPON IN NUMEROUS COIN MISSIONS IN NORTH CONDOR WHERE HE HAD BEEN SENT TO DISRUPT SUPPLY FELLOWSHIPS SNEAKING DOWN THE TRAIL

THE KOAN SMILED EVEN WITHOUT A HEAD THIS MISSION WAS ALMOST GOING TO BE A TAKING OUT A SQUAD OF SLEEPING HALFLINGS WAS GOING TO BE EASIER THAN SLAYING WYVERNS SITTING ON A TARMAC

HUNT FOR THE RING TOM CLANCY
NICE I JUST THE ANIMATED VERSION ON DVD AFTER PREVIOUSLY OWNING IT ON VHS ONLY THIS POST MADE ME WANT TO WATCH IT THIS EVENING GANDALF SEEMS SUPER AGILE IN THESE ONES SCENES SEEM TO BE RATHER SHORT THOUGH MAKES ME WONDER IF THERE WAS EVEN MORE MATERIAL OF THE FIGHT THAT GOT CUTTED AND LOST AFTERWARDS
NEEDS MORE SMOLDERING
I'M ASSUMING IT SAYS

ASH NAG DURBATULÛK ASH NAG GIMBATUL

ASH NAG THRAKATULÛK AGH KRIMPATUL

THAT'S THE RING INSCRIPTION

ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL

ONE RING TO FIND THEM

ONE RING TO BRING THEM ALL

AND IN THE DARKNESS BIND THEM

NICE SIGN THO
LOVE
DELETED
I CANNOT URGE YOU ENOUGH DEFINITELY READ THE HOBBIT FIRST IT'S A VERY QUICK READ IT WAS WRITTEN FIRST AND IT TAKES PLACE BEFORE THE TRILOGY IT'S A GREAT INTRODUCTION TO MIDDLE-EARTH AND AS YOU KNOW EVENTS IN THE HOBBIT DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE LORD OF THE RINGS
YES

AND READ THE CHILDREN OF AURIN AFTER
THE HOBBIT NARRATED BY ROB INGLIS IS GREAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY LISTEN TO IT FIRST
I MEAN IT'S NOT NECESSARY BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
DID THE SAME LAST YEAR
P ADAMHILL
IS IT FOR A SPECIFIC CLASS THAT WOULD HELP WITH FINDING AN ANGLE TO APPROACH IT HOWEVER IF NOT THE MOVIES PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATE HOW EVEN THE SMALLEST ACTIONS WE SEE THEM AS BEING SMALL CAN IMPACT OTHERS FOR EXAMPLE BILBO KEEPING THE RING OR GANDALF LETTING BILBO TO KEEP THE RING WITHOUT HIM INSPECTING IT THAT IMPACTED THE WHOLE STORY OF THE LOAR MOVIES THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT MORE I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO WRITE AN ESSAY AND MAKE YOU READ IT BEFORE YOU COULD GIVE A LITTLE MORE INFO
WHY WOULD THE SCHOOL NOT LET YOU DO THE BOOKS THAT SEEMS RIDICULOUS
THE NAME OF THE WIND BY PATRICK ROTHFUSS

A WIZARD OF EARTHPEA BY URSULA LEAGUING

THE EYE OF THE WORLD BY ROBERT JORDAN

NORTHERN LIGHTS BY PHILLIP PULLMAN KNOWN AS THE GOLDEN COMPASS IN THE USGA

OR MORE TZOLKIN

THE CHILDREN OF AURIN

THE SILMARILLION BEWARE THIS IS LIKE HISTORY OF THE ALL MIDDLE EARTH FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ELVES IT READS A BIT LIKE AN OLD GREEK HISTORY TEXT OR THE BIBLE IT IS AWESOME THOUGH
A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE

AND DEFINITELY THE TWO TZOLKIN BOOKS THE PREVIOUS POSTER MENTIONED
INTERESTING POINT IN THAT WRITE UP THAT I EXPERIENCE TOO I LEAVE THEATRES FEELING LIKE I SHOULD HAVE ENJOYED A MOVIE MORE THAN I DID I FEEL THAT MOSTLY WITH MARVEL CINEMATIC MOVIES BUT ALSO FELT IT MOST FILMS I GO SEE AT THE CINEMA INCLUDING THE HOBBIT AND JAMES BOND

IS IT ME AM I DEPRESSED AM I SICK OF MOVIES OR IS IT THE MOVIES THAT HAVE GONE DOWNHILL SOME PEOPLE RAVE ABOUT HOW AMAZING DR STRANGE IS BUT I FOUND IT TO BE KINDA MPH I LOVE STAR TREK AND CAN SEE THAT BEYOND IS A BETTER FILM THAN INTO DARKNESS YET CAME OUT OF THE CINEMA SORT OF HAPPY BUT ALSO A BIT MPH ABOUT THE WHOLE THING ALL THESE MOVIES SEEM BETTER CONSTRUCTED THAN EVER BEFORE WITH THE MOST AMAZING SPECTACLES AND ACTION THEY ALSO SEEM TO HAVE DECENT PLOTS AND CHARACTERS I JUST DON'T GET INTO THEM NEARLY AS MUCH AS SAY WHEN I FIRST SAW LOAR OR CASINO ROYALE OR IRON MAN
TREKS LAME I REALLY LIKED THE HOBBIT MOVIES
FLOTER

HAD TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT ONE
THAT'S AMAZING GOOD STUFF
MY GRANDDAD LOVES LOAR TOO BUT HE NEVER WATCHED THE MOVIES AND HAS FORGOTTEN MOST OF IT SO I CAN'T DO THE SAME
OME JUST SAW ONE OF THESE IN BOSTON RECENTLY
WQDPX
SHDWFX WHITE MOTORCYCLE PLATE
YAMAHA
BILBO WOULD HAVE ENDED UP JUST LIKE GOLLUM IT'S QUINTESSENTIAL TO THE STORY THAT BILBO DISCOVERS THE RING WHILST IN A MOMENT OF PITY AND MERCY
THEN THE RING WOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF SARON
BILBO WOULDN'T BECOME A HERO FRODO WOULDN'T BECOME A HERO SARON WOULD STILL BEGIN THE SEARCH FOR THE RING AND PROBABLY FOUND IT IMO END OF STORY NO EVERYDAY DEEDS OF ORDINARY FOLK KEPT DARKNESS AT BAY THAT'S HOW I LOVE TO SEE IT

EDIT GRAMMAR
THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD QUESTION SINCE GOLLUM REALLY HAD A BIG INFLUENCE ON THE LORD OF THE RINGS AND HOBBIT STORY

I THINK MOST OF THE HOBBIT WOULD HAVE PLAYED OUT THE SAME

BUT IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS WHEN FRODO AND SAM GET LOST GOLLUM IS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD HAVE HELPED THEM FIND THE BLACK GATE

EVEN IF THEY WOULD FIND IT WITHOUT HIS HELP THEY WOULD TRY TO RUN THROUGH THE BLACK GATE JUST LIKE THEY TRIED IN THE MOVIE BEFORE GOLLUM STOPPED THEM AND MOST LIKELY GET CAPTURED SINCE THEY DIDN'T KNOW OF ANY SECRET PASSAGES LIKE GOLLUM DID
I THINK SAM WOULD HAVE ENDED UP TACKLING FRODO INTO THE LAVA IF THEY WOULD HAVE MADE IT THAT FAR WITH NO GUIDE FRODO AND SAM WERE GONNA TRY AND WALK THROUGH THE BLACK GATE FOR FUCKS SAKE GOLLUM WAS KINDA NEEDED EVEN IF HE DID TRY TO FUCK ON THEM
WELL FOR STARTERS SARON PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE RING
HOW DO PEOPLE BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THAT
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
ACME FOR THE WIN
I ALWAYS FIND THINGS LIKE THIS IMPRESSIVE I SPENT THE ENTIRETY OF MY SHORT MINECRAFT CAREER BUILDING A MASSIVE DICK MADE OF GOLD
SAVED TO FAVORITES BAR
I SEESEE YOUUUUUU
THE GREAT EYE IS EVER WATCHFUL
SOURCE
I DON'T KNOW HALF OF YOU HER HALF AS WELL AS I SHOULD LIKE AND I LIKE LESS THAN HALF OF YOU HER HALF AS WELL AS YOU SHE DESERVES
NEVER LAUGH AT LIVE DRAGONS

BUT SERIOUSLY I THINK DEEP ROOTS ARE NOT REACHED BY THE FROST CAN HAVE STRONG APPLICABILITY HERE
I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS TOO PRETENTIOUS OR STRANGE OR WHAT BUT NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE WAITED THIS IS THE END NOW NOT DAY ONLY SHALL BE BELOVED BUT NIGHT TOO SHALL BE BEAUTIFUL AND BLESSED AND ALL ITS FEAR PASS AWAY

FRODO FROM ROK AT ARWEN AND WEDDING

THERE'S ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES MAY IT BE A LIGHT TO YOU IN DARK PLACES WHEN ALL OTHER LIGHTS GO OUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SAM IN ROK ABOUT LIGHT

A LOT OF LOAR QUOTES ARE LIKE THAT ABOUT THINGS BEING BEAUTIFUL DESPITE GRIEF DANGER OR PAIN THE SWEETEST ONES SEEM TO BE ABOUT HOME FAMILY OR LOYALTY NOT ABOUT ROMANTIC LOVE AND THEY'RE VERY THAT SAID THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE RELEVANT QUOTES OUT THERE THAN THE ONES I'VE JUST FOUNDATION

FROM THE ROK MOVIE ONLY IF SHE DOESN'T MIND THAT I WOULD RATHER SHARE ONE LIFETIME WITH YOU THAN FACE ALL THE AGES OF THIS WORLD ALONE

THERE'S ALSO LEAF BY NIGGLE SHORT STORY AND HIS OTHER WORKS THE SIL UT HOME IN THE LEGENDARIUM BUT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WANTED ANYTHING
I KNEW WHAT IT WOULD BE BEFORE I CLICKED I LOVE THAT PASSAGE I LOVE THE IMPLICATION THAT SPIRIT MAY HAVE RETURNED THERE AFTER HE PASSED

IT'S ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT ARAGON AND ARWEN UNDÓMIEL WERE TROTHED ON CERIN AGOROTH AND SHE ALSO CAME THERE TO DIE WHEN HER TIME CAME
DID ANY OF THE TEXTS EVER LEAVE EVEN A HINT OF A CHANCE MORGOTH MIGHT ONE DAY ESCAPE AND THE BARONGS WOULD RETURN TO FIGHT
BANE THE LAST OF ITS KIND
MY HEART RACES AND MY EYES WATER UP WHENEVER THE FELLOWSHIP PLAYS IT'S ABSOLUTELY INSANE THAT A MOVIE SOUNDTRACK CAN DO THAT TO A NORMALLY EMOTIONLESS BASTARD SUCH AS MYSELF
THE SOUNDTRACK IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE SUCCESS OF THE IN MY OPINION THEY'RE SO ALIVE WITH EMOTION AND SLIDE INTO THE ADAPTATION PETER JACKSON CREATED SO EFFORTLESSLY
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT BY THEMSELVES THERE ARE OTHER FILM SCORES THAT I PREFER LISTENING TO YET IN TERMS OF WATCHING THE FILMS THERE'S NOT A SINGLE ONE THAT COMES CLOSE TO THE LORD OF THE RINGS SCORE THAT EVOKES SUCH EMOTION IN ME
I GOT TO PLAY 1ST HORN FOR A SPECIAL YOUTH SYMPHONY CONCERT WHERE WE DID OVER HOURS OF ORIGINAL ARRANGEMENTS THE HOBBIT THEME HAD BEEN THE MUSIC FOR MY BROTHER'S FUNERAL A FEW YEARS PREVIOUS ONE OF THE MOST HEARTFELT EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE
GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS BEAUTIFUL
I KNEW THE SCORE WAS FANTASTIC BUT IT DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THIS DIVINE
I ACTUALLY DOWNLOADED ALMOST HALF OF THE SCORE FOR LOAR ON MY PHONE FOR A WEEK BACKPACKING TRIP THROUGH THE SIERRA NEVADA NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS GLORIOUS
SAME FOR ALLOT OF FILMS STAR WARS FOR EXAMPLE WOULDEST HAVE HAD HALF THE EMOTION IF ANY
THIS WAS AMAZING
I'M GONNA PUT THE CD IN MY STEREO RIGHT NOW
LOVE WHAT THIS VIDEO IS TRYING TO DO BUT THE NARRATOR TALKS THROUGH SO MANY OF THE EXAMPLES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR WHAT HE'S TRYING TO GET US TO LISTEN TO
A WELL UTILISED SCORE IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE WEAK POINTS OF MARVEL MOVIES
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT THESE FILMS
IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IRKS ME MOST ABOUT THE HOBBIT FILMS THEY LACK THE MUSICAL CONTINUITY OF THE PREVIOUS TRILOGY
FOR EXAMPLE I LOVE THE OVER HILL ADVENTURING THEME IN ADJ BUT YOU NEVER HEAR IT AGAIN IN ANY OF THE OTHER HOBBIT MOVIES

THE RING GOES SOUTH IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE
HOWARD SHORE AND HANS ZIMMER MY GOODNESS CAN THOSE MEN PACE A MOVIE WITH A SOUNDTRACK
MOOOAAARRRR


AND PERGOLAS JUMPS ON HIS SHIELD LIKE A SKATEBOARD AND TOTALLY RIDES IT DOWN THE STAIRS AND HE'S SHOOTING ARROWS LIKE A AND IT IS SERIOUSLY REALLY COOL HE IS WRECKING SHIT
THIS LOOKED LIKE IT TOOK A LOT OF EFFORT FROM THOSE KIDS GOOD JOB
AS A POLISH PERSON THIS IS A CLASSIC HERE ALL MY FRIENDS HAVE SEEN THIS AT SOME POINT
THEY SEEDED THE SHIT OUT OF THAT
THIS IS SO COOL I'M YEARS OLD AND THIS IS LIKE A BLAST FROM THE PAST OF MY OWN CHILDHOOD THINKING ABOUT MY FRIENDS AND I REACTING LOAR HONESTLY IF YOU WERE YOUNG ENOUGH TO SEE THEM AS A KID AT SOME POINT YOU DID THIS ALTHOUGH NOT TO THIS LEVEL OF SKILL
WHAT KIND OF SICK CHILDHOOD IS THAT DON'T THOSE KIDS HAVE VIDEO GAMES AND SMART PHONES S
I AUDIBLY BURST OUT LAUGHING AT THIS IS PRETTY GREAT
THIS IS SO IMPRESSIVE
WATCHING SOMETHING LIKE THIS MAKES ME TOTALLY UNDERSTAND PEOPLE THAT AARP I KNOW THESE KIDS AREN'T CARPERS THAT LONGING TO DO THIS KIND OF KID STUFF AGAIN AND JUST DOING IT AND HAVING FUN WITH IT I DON'T SEE MYSELF AS A AARP GUY BUT CARPERS DO YOUR THING
R DEEPINTOYOUTUBE
REMINDS ME OF R SEEDED
OH MY GOD I REMEMBER THAT I'VE SEEN THAT IN LIKE
WOW THEY ARE GOING TO GET LAID IN COLLEGE
LIKE WHEN GALADRIEL SENDS SARON AWAY NOT GANDALF

DESPITE WHAT PETER JACKSON WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE GANDALF CREDITS SAURURAN WITH RUNNING SARON OUT OF DOL GOULDER

FOR SAURURAN THE WHITE IS THE GREATEST OF MY ORDER RADAGAST IS OF COURSE A WORTHY WIZARD A MASTER OF SHAPES AND CHANGES OF HUE AND HE HAS MUCH LORE OF HERBS AND BEASTS AND BIRDS ARE ESPECIALLY HIS FRIENDS BUT SAURURAN HAS LONG STUDIED THE ARTS OF THE ENEMY HIMSELF AND THUS WE HAVE OFTEN BEEN ABLE TO FORESTALL HIM IT WAS BY THE DEVICES OF SAURURAN THAT WE DROVE HIM FROM DOL GOULDER IT MIGHT BE THAT HE HAD FOUND SOME WEAPON THAT WOULD DRIVE BACK THE NINE
IT ISN'T REALLY LIKE THAT IN THE BOOKS BLAME FRAN AND PETER

2 GANDALF AND THE REST OF THE INSTAR HAS SPECIFICALLY BEEN LIMITED IN THE POWER HE WAS ALLOWED TO USE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST SARON WHY SO THAT THE PEOPLE'S OF MIDDLE EARTH DON'T JUST DEFER TO THE MAAR AND BE RULED BY THEM AND PERHAPS ALSO TO AVOID ANOTHER SINKING OF BELERIAND SITUATION

IN ANY CASE IT'S CLEAR THE WIZARDS ARE THERE TO INSPIRE AND ADVISE NOT CONQUER
GANDALF ISN'T ALLOWED TO USE HIS POWER TO COERCE ELVES OR MEN TO DO WHAT HE WANTS HE IS MOSTLY JUST A COUNCILLOR ALLOWED TO INSPIRE PEOPLE BUT NOT ORDER HEM AROUND ASIDE FROM HOW THIS IS DEPICTED IN THE MOVIES GALADRIEL IS A POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL PERSON HERSELF SHE SENT GWAIHIR WHO SEEMS TO BE THE CHIEF OF THE EAGLES TO SEARCH FOR GANDALF AFTER HE PERISHED IN THE FIGHT WITH THE BARONG AND GANDALF WAS CLOTHED IN WHITE IN LOTHLÓRIEN AND WAS HEALED THERE POSSIBLY GALADRIEL HAS ALSO BEEN IN MIDDLE-EARTH LONGER THAN GANDALF ALTHOUGH WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT EARLY DOINGS

ANYWAY THE ELVES GENERALLY HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR GANDALF AND VICE VERSA CHURDAN GAVE HIM THE RING ANARYA ELROD GIVES HIM GREAT PRAISE DURING THE COUNCIL OF ELROD WHEN GANDALF THE WHITE MEETS ARAGON PERGOLAS AND GIMLI HE BRINGS MORE OR LESS PROPHETIC MESSAGES MESSAGES ARE THAT ARAGON SHOULD SEEK THE PATHS OF THE DEAD AND SHE TELLS PERGOLAS HE WILL NOT REST AFTER HE HAS HEARD THE CRIES OF GULLS AND THAT IT WOULD SPARK HIS DESIRE FOR THE SEA
THE WIZARDS TENDED TO NOT MAKE A DISPLAY OF THEIR POWERS SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT SHAKE THE PEOPLE THE EMISSARIES WERE FORBIDDEN TO SEEK TO RULE THE WILLS OF MEN OR ELVES BY OPEN DISPLAY OF POWER THE INSTAR THEY WERE INDEED POWERFUL LESSER PEERS OF SARON THEY MUST BE MIGHTY PEERS OF SARON BUT AS ARAGON SAID TO THE HOBBITS IN BREE THEY BASICALLY ONLY SAW FIREWORKS

GANDALF IS GREATER THAN YOU KNOW AS A RULE YOU CAN ONLY SEE HIS JOKES AND TOYS STRIDER

WHEN SARON WAS CHASED FROM DOL GOULDER IT WAS A FEINT ON HIS PART ANYWAY SINCE HE HAD BEEN PREPARED TO LEAVE GALADRIEL HERSELF IS ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST ELVES IN HISTORY SHE IS NOT JUST SOME ELF THOSE COMPARABLE TO HER ARE HER UNCLE FËANOR AND HER COUSIN LÚTHIEN LESSER ELVES THAN HER HAVE KILLED BARONGS
VIGO COULD HAVE MADE A GREAT BOND
GOD DAMN HE'S STILL LOOKING FINE AS SHIT
SAY WHAT YOU WANT BUT THIS ACTUALLY MADE ME READ A WIKI ARTICLE ABOUT THE COLONY DISAPPEARANCE DISORDER

I DON'T BELIEVE IT
FLEA SAVES BEES
VIJJIO MORGANSTEIIIN
WE'LL SEE WHO BRINGS IN MORE HONEY
GOLDEN HAIR STRINGS
WATCH THE MOVIES YOU WILL SURELY UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECT BETTER AND YOU WOULD ALSO BE DOING YOURSELF A HUGE FAVOR
WHAT IS THE BUDGET IS IT THE TYPE OF SECRET SANTA WHERE THE GIFT SHOULD BE FUNNY A JOKE GIFT OR HANDMADE
I KNOW I'M ASKING FOR THE TZOLKIN CALENDAR FOR MYSELF FOR CHRISTMAS I KNOW IT'S MOSTLY BASED ON THE HOBBIT ILLUSTRATIONS THOUGH
DP REF DTF CALID SCOLIID IAH
MAD SKILLS
THE ONLY THING MISSING ARE THE JEWELS ENCRUSTED IN HIS BELLY
DELETED
ONE THING THAT HAS ALWAYS CAUSED ME SOME CONFUSION WHEN READING THE WORKS OF TZOLKIN IS THE INCONSISTENCIES THAT ARE PRESENT BETWEEN THE SUPPOSED STRENGTHS OF THE VARIOUS RACES TAKE THE ALAR AND THEIR WAR AGAINST MORGOTH MORGOTH IS STATED TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE AINU AND IS ABLE TO GIVE THE ALAR SIGNIFICANT TROUBLES OVER THE YEARS AND IS PROVEN VERY DIFFICULT TO DEFEAT AS SEEN IN THE WAR OF WRATH YET FINGOLFIN A MERE ELF IS CAPABLE OF WOUNDING MORGOTH IN A ONE ON ONE DUEL

OKAY THIS ONE IS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE VALAQUENTA MORGOTH STARTS OFF WITH A SLIGHT EDGE OVER FANWE BUT AS TIME GOES ON DISSIPATES HIS ENERGY INTO THE THINGS HE CREATES ALTERS ORCS TROLLS GIANT WOLVES DRAGONS ETC ALL TAKE SOME INVESTMENT OF PERSONAL STRENGTH IN THE SAME WAY THAT SARON INVESTS HIMSELF INTO THE RING THUS MORGOTH IS FAR WEAKER THAN THE OTHER ALAR AS TIME GOES ON

SEE ALSO MELIAN THE MAIA IS ABLE TO FENCE OUT MORGOTH INDEFINITELY LUTHIER KICKS BUTT MORGOTH FEARS THE SUN


FURTHERMORE VICTORY OVER A BARONG A MAAR THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POWERFUL THAN AN ELF COMPARE THIS TO FIGHT WITH ANOTHER BARONG IN MORIA WHERE THEY FOUGHT FOR DAYS AND BOTH OF THEM WERE KILLED GLORFINDEL IS NO WHERE NEAR THE STRENGTH OF GANDALF WHO IS ALSO A MAAR AND IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO MAKE THIS SEEM EVEN MORE UNREASONABLE GANDALF WAS ALSO WEARING A RING OF POWER IN THIS BATTLE AND THE BARONG STILL KILLED HIM PERHAPS THE BARONG GLORFINDEL FACED WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS POWERFUL THAN THE ONE GANDALF DEFEATED BUT REGARDLESS BARONGS ARE STILL MAAR

TWO THINGS FIRSTLY THE TEXT WHERE GLORFINDEL DEFEATS A BARONG SIGNIFICANTLY PREDATES THE LORD OF THE RINGS AND TZOLKIN CHANGED HIS MIND OVER TIME WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A HUGE ARMY OF WEAKER BARONGS OR A SMALL NUMBER OF VERY STRONG BARONGS

SECONDLY THE ELDEN RINGS ARE NOT WEAPONS IT HELPS GANDALF NOT AT ALL TO HAVE ONE WHEN FIGHTING THE BARONG EVEN THE ONE RING IS A TOOL OF DOMINATION NOT STRENGTH ALSO THE INSTAR ARE TRULY BOUND TO THEIR BODIES AND LIMITED IN THEIR POWER IN MIDDLE EARTH THIS IS TO PREVENT ANOTHER SINKING OF BELERIAND SITUATION AND TO AVOID MEN JUST WORSHIPPING THEM OR LETTING THEM RULE


ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS VICTORY OVER THE GREATEST BARONG GOTHMOG SIMPLY BY PUSHING HIM INTO A FOUNTAIN TO EXTINGUISH HIS FLAME


TEXTUAL HISTORY STRIKES AGAIN I BELIEVE REMEMBER THE SILMARILLION WAS ASSEMBLED BY CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN FROM MANY DRAFTS AND SOME OF THEM ARE CONFLICTING IN DETAIL


FINALLY REMEMBER SMALL PEOPLE WITH COURAGE SELF SACRIFICE AND A BIT OF LUCK NUDGES FROM ERU CAN ACHIEVE AMAZING THINGS IN THIS WORLD LOOK AT SAM AND SHELDON OR FRODO AND SARON

THIS IS NOT DRAGON BALL Z POWER LEVEL IS NOT A RELIABLE MEASURE OF WHO CAN BEAT WHOM IN A FIGHT

IT WASN'T DUE TO MORGOTH BRING SLOW IN HIS ARMOR THAT ALLOWED FINGOLFIN TO WOUND HIM IT ALL STEMS FROM PHILOSOPHY THAT EVIL SPENDS ITSELF MORGOTH SPENT HIS POWER IN HIS CORRUPTION OF THE EARTH AND IN THE RAISING OF HIS ARMIES AND DESTRUCTION THAT HE WROUGHT THE SUM TOTAL OF THE POWER OF THE MORGOTH WHO CONTENDED WITH THE ALAR AND AINU IN THE BEGINNING WAS EQUAL TO THE TOTALITY OF OF THE POWER OF HOST MORGOTH HIMSELF BECAME LESSER AS HIS EVIL SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THAT POWER WAS LOST TO MORGOTH FOREVER BUT REMAINED IN HIS HOST THAT IS WHY THE WAR OF WRATH WAS SO DAMAGING BUT MORGOTH HIMSELF COULDN'T FIGHT BACK IN THE END HE WAS A SHELL OF HIS FORMER SELF FINGOLFIN WAS ALSO NOT SOME MERE ELF HE WAS THE HIGH KING OF THE NOLUDAR BORN IN AMAN BEFORE THE FADING OF THE TREES AND CONSUMED BY RAGE AND GRIEF THERE WAS A POWER IN HIM THAT MEANT HE COULD FIGHT BUT NEVER BE VICTORIOUS

FOR THE OTHER CASES

WITH GLORFINDEL AND THE BARONG GLORFINDEL WASN'T JUST A MERE ELF EITHER HE WAS AN OF GONDOLIER AND MIGHTY EVEN AMONG FOLK EVEN THEN HE WAS KILLED IN THE FIGHT GANDALF WAS LIMITED IN THE USE OF HIS POWER WHILE IN MIDDLE-EARTH AND AS SUCH COULD HARDLY BE CONSIDERED MIGHTIER

AS FOR EÄRENDIL FIGHTING ANCALAGON THE BLACK WE HAVE SEEN OTHER DRAGONS SLAIN BY MORTAL MEN IN SLAYING OF GLAURUNG WHILE ANCALAGON WAS THE LIGHTEST OF THE DRAGONS TO EVER LIVE EÄRENDIL WAS THE SCION OF PERHAPS THE GREATEST LINE IN THE HISTORY OF THE FIRST AGE AND WAS IN A SHIP SET INTO THE SKY BY THE AINU AND HE WAS IN POSSESSION OF A SILMARIL AND WAS BEING AIDED BY THE EAGLES OF FANWE AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR STRENGTH ALONGSIDE UNTOLD OTHER AINU

THE ELVES WERE IN THE YOUTH OF THEIR PEOPLE AND THE SPRINGTIME OF THE POWER THEY WERE AT THEIR MIGHTIEST AND EVEN THEN ONLY A FEW OF THE ELVES COULD HOPE TO CONTEND WITH THE AINU AND WHEN THEY DID MOST OFTEN THEY DIED CONTENDING WITH MORGOTH MEANT FACING THE SUM OF ALL HIS POWER IN THE END A POWER THAT WAS GREATER THAN ALL THE OTHER ALAR OF COURSE IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT BATTLE AND IN THE END IT DESTROYED BELERIAND

HOPE THIS CLEARS UP SOME OF THIS
ALSO GLORFINDEL AND ECTHELION WERE ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL ELVES
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED THAT THE CONCEPTION OF HOW POWERFUL BARONGS WERE VARIED OVER THE COURSE OF WRITING BUT ASIDE FROM THAT IT IS HEAVILY IMPLIED EVEN IN LOAR THAT GLORFINDEL IS POWERFUL IN HIS OWN WORDS WHEN HE MEETS THE ON THE WAY TO RIVENDELL

THEY SAID THAT THE NINE WERE
ABROAD AND THAT YOU WERE ASTRAY BEARING A GREAT BURDEN WITHOUT GUIDANCE FOR
GANDALF HAD NOT RETURNED THERE ARE FEW EVEN IN RIVENDELL THAT CAN RIDE OPENLY
AGAINST THE NINE BUT SUCH AS THERE WERE ELROD SENT OUT NORTH WEST AND
SOUTHERN IT WAS THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT TURN FAR ASIDE TO AVOID PURSUIT AND
BECOME LOST IN THE WILDERNESS

THAT IMPLIES HE IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO RIDE OPENLY AGAINST THE NINE

THEN HE SAYS

IT WAS MY LOT TO TAKE THE ROAD AND I CAME TO THE BRIDGE OF MITHEITHEL
AND LEFT A TOKEN THERE NIGH ON SEVEN DAYS AGO THREE OF THE SERVANTS OF
SARON WERE UPON THE BRIDGE BUT THEY WITHDREW AND I PURSUED THEM WESTWARD I
CAME ALSO UPON TWO OTHERS BUT THEY TURNED AWAY SOUTHWARD

SO IT SEEMS HE IS DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO MAKE A BUNCH OF RINGWRAITHS WITHDRAW

WHEN FRODO AWAKENS IN RIVENDELL GANDALF SAYS THIS

AND HERE IN RIVENDELL THERE LIVE STILL SOME OF HIS CHIEF
FOES THE LORDS OF THE ELDAR FROM BEYOND THE FURTHEST SEAS THEY
DO NOT FEAR THE RINGWRAITHS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE DWELT IN THE BLESSED REALM
LIVE AT ONCE IN BOTH WORLDS AND AGAINST BOTH THE SEEN AND THE UNSEEN THEY
HAVE GREAT POWER

I THOUGHT THAT I SAW A WHITE FIGURE THAT SHONE AND DID NOT GROW DIM LIKE
THE OTHERS WAS THAT GLORFINDEL THEN

YES YOU SAW HIM FOR A MOMENT AS HE IS UPON THE OTHER SIDE ONE OF THE
MIGHTY OF THE FIRSTBORN HE IS AN OF A HOUSE OF PRINCES INDEED THERE
IS A POWER IN RIVENDELL TO WITHSTAND THE MIGHT OF MORDOR FOR A WHILE AND
ELSEWHERE OTHER POWERS STILL DWELL

THEN HE SAYS THIS ABOUT THE CHASE TO THE FORD

THE RIDERS MADE STRAIGHT FOR
YOU AS SOON AS YOU FLED THEY DID NOT NEED THE GUIDANCE OF THEIR HORSES ANY
LONGER YOU HAD BECOME VISIBLE TO THEM BEING ALREADY ON THE THRESHOLD OF
THEIR WORLD AND ALSO THE RING DREW THEM YOUR FRIENDS SPRANG ASIDE OFF THE
ROAD OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RIDDEN DOWN THEY KNEW THAT NOTHING COULD SAVE
YOU IF THE WHITE HORSE COULD NOT THE RIDERS WERE TOO SWIFT TO OVERTAKE AND
TOO MANY TO OPPOSE ON FOOT EVEN GLORFINDEL AND ARAGON TOGETHER COULD NOT
WITH STAND ALL THE NINE AT ONCE

SO ON FOOT THEY COULD NOT WITHSTAND THE NINE EVEN GLORFINDEL AND ARAGON TOGETHER AND BUT LATER HE SAYS

THERE THEY HASTILY KINDLED FIRE FOR GLORFINDEL KNEW THAT A FLOOD WOULD COME
DOWN IF THE RIDERS TRIED TO CROSS AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANY
THAT WERE LEFT ON HIS SIDE OF THE RIVER THE MOMENT THE FLOOD APPEARED HE
RUSHED OUT FOLLOWED BY ARAGON AND THE OTHERS WITH FLAMING BRANDS CAUGHT
BETWEEN FIRE AND WATER AND SEEING AN REVEALED IN HIS WRATH THEY
WERE DISMAYED AND THEIR HORSES WERE STRICKEN WITH MADNESS THREE WERE CARRIED
AWAY BY THE FIRST ASSAULT OF THE FLOOD THE OTHERS WERE NOW HURLED INTO THE
WATER BY THEIR HORSES AND OVERWHELMED

SO THEY AT LEAST FEARED AN REVEALED IN HIS WRATH

TO CONTRAST GANDALF SAYS THIS ABOUT HIS ENCOUNTER WITH THE NINE

I GALLOPED TO FEATHERTOP LIKE A GALE AND I REACHED IT BEFORE SUNDOWN ON
MY SECOND DAY FROM THEY WERE THERE BEFORE ME THEY DREW AWAY FROM ME
FOR THEY FELT THE COMING OF MY ANGER AND THEY DARED NOT FACE IT WHILE THE SUN
WAS IN THE SKY BUT THEY CLOSED ROUND AT NIGHT AND I WAS BESIEGED ON THE
HILL-TOP IN THE OLD RING OF AMON SAL I WAS HARD PUT TO IT INDEED SUCH LIGHT
AND FLAME CANNOT HAVE BEEN SEEN ON FEATHERTOP SINCE THE OF OLD

AT SUNRISE I ESCAPED AND FLED TOWARDS THE NORTHERN I COULD NOT HOPE TO DO
MORE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND YOU FRODO IN THE WILDERNESS AND IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN FOLLY TO TRY WITH ALL THE NINE AT MY HEELS

SO THEY FLED FROM GANDALF DURING THE DAY BUT GANDALF WAS HARD PUT TO IT TO RESIST THE NINE DURING THE NIGHT

AND LATER GANDALF MENTIONS DURING THE COUNCIL OF ELROD THAT EVEN AN SUCH AS GLORFINDEL COULD NOT FIGHT HIS WAY TO MORDOR ON HIS OWN WHICH SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT GLORFINDEL IS USED AS A MEASURE OF STRENGTH

I THINK ELROD THAT IN THIS
MATTER IT WOULD BE WELL TO TRUST RATHER TO THEIR FRIENDSHIP THAN TO GREAT
WISDOM EVEN IF YOU CHOSE FOR US AN SUCH AS GLORFINDEL HE COULD NOT
STORM THE DARK TOWER NOR OPEN THE ROAD TO THE FIRE BY THE POWER THAT IS IN
HIM

SO THEY DON'T LET GLORFINDEL TAG ALONG WITH THE FELLOWSHIP BUT THEY CHOOSE A BUNCH OF RUSTIC HOBBITS MERRY AND PIPPIN I FEEL THAT IN MANY CASES IT IS NOT REALLY ABOUT THE INHERENT POWER OF SOMEONE IN MIDDLE-EARTH BUT ABOUT THEIR INTENTIONS MERRY AND PIPPIN ARE IMPORTANT NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE POWERFUL BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND LOYALTY TO FRODO AND LATER THEY SERVE TO REDEEM BOOMIER WHO DIES TRYING TO SAVE THEM AND BY MEETING TREEBEARD AND ALSO ARAGON MEETS GANDALF JUST IN TIME BECAUSE HE WAS CHASING THE ORCS THAT CAPTURED MERRY AND PIPPIN

FRODO AND GOLLUM BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES MANAGE TO BRING ULTIMATE DEFEAT TO SARON A FEAT WHICH EVEN ELENDIL AND WERE NOT ABLE TO DO ALSO THE EAGLES SHOW UP AT TIMES WHEN SOMEONE MAKES THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE THEY SAVE THE BODIES OF FINGOLFIN AND GLORFINDEL AFTER THEY BRAVELY FOUGHT EVIL AND THEY ALSO SHOWED UP BEFORE THE BLACK GATE WHERE THE ARMIES OF THE WEST WERE BASICALLY JUST BAIT AND HAD NO HOPE OF SURVIVAL BUT THEY DID THE RIGHT THING AND THEN THE EAGLES SAVED FRODO AND SAM AND EÄRENDIL WENT INTO THE WEST AND MANAGED TO PASS THE BAN OF THE ALAR WHY BECAUSE HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF TO DELIVER THE ELVES AND MEN OF BELERIAND FROM EVIL AND ONLY THEN CAME HELP FROM ABOVE BEDEN PASSED THE GIRDLE OF MELIAN BECAUSE A GREAT DOOM WAS UPON HIM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT EVEN MORGOTH COULD NOT PIERCE THE GIRDLE OF MELIAN

I FEEL THAT IN MANY CASES IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW POWERFUL SOMEONE IS BUT IT IS A BATTLE ON THE MORAL PLANE AS JERT SAYS ABOUT GANDALF IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS THERE IS A VAGUELY SIMILAR THEME IN THE BIBLICAL STORY OF GIDEON

MINOR NITPICK MAAR IS THE PLURAL MAIA IS THE SINGULAR
WHEN THE AINU INCARNATE THEY DO BECOME VULNERABLE SARON LOST IN A DUEL BETWEEN HIMSELF AND ELENDIL MORGOTH WAS A BEING OF TERRIBLE POWER AND NONE SAVE ERU WAS STRONGER MIGHTIER HE POSSESSED THE SKILLS AND ABILITIES OF ALL THE OTHER ALAR AND WAS AS MIGHTY AS THEM ALL IN HIS BEGINNING AT HIS LOWEST POINT CONFINED TO HIS MATERIAL FORM HE WAS MERELY A SHADOW OF HIS FORMER SELF BUT STILL A TYRANT OF OGRE SIZE AND MONSTROUS POWER I ACTUALLY THINK HE WAS STILL A VALA LEVEL BEING AT THE END BUT THIS IS A FAR CRY FROM HIS PEAK

WHEN GLORFINDEL WAS REINCARNATED HIS MIGHT WAS VERY MUCH NEAR TO MAIA LEVEL YET IT WAS NOTED THAT FËANOR WAS THE MIGHTIEST OF THE ALL OF THE CHILDREN OF ILÚVATAR HIS VOICE HAD INFLUENCE OVER A MAIA EVEN THOUGH THEY TRIED TO STILL HIS PASSION BY WARNING HIM HE COULD NOT BEAT MORGOTH EVEN IF HE WERE THREE TIMES AS POWERFUL AS HE WAS
THIS AND POTATOES

NOTE I'M ON A PHONE APP AND HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO HYPER LINK ON IT IT'S IN THE MORNING AND I'LL FIND OUT HOW TOMORROW SORRY FOR THE FORMATTING
WOW THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME OF THIS I CANNOT WAIT TO PLAY IN THE MORNING FOR MY DAUGHTERS THEY WILL BE SO APPRECIATIVE TO HEAR THIS AGAIN AFTER YEARS OR SO

TELL ME WHERE IS GRANDAD FOR I MUCH DESIRE TO SPEAK TO HIM THAT LINE CRACKS ME UP EVERYTIME
YOU HAVE MY SWORD

AND MY BOW

AND MY UNVOTE
THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY WEEKEND
THE VIDEO CAME TO THE DENIZENS OF THE INTERNET WHO TOOK IT DEEP INTO THE TUNNELS OF REDDIN AND THERE IT CONSUMED THEM
YES YES HE SAYS IT WAS SAURURAN MESSING WITH DENETHOR THROUGH THE PALANTIR WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY SARON STILL A DAMNED ACCURATE ARTICLE
THIS IS GREAT I JUST WISH WHEN HE SAID STAFF OFFICER HE FOLLOWED WITH A PUN INTENDED
I'M NOT SURE WHY THE WRITER PRESUMED THAT TZOLKIN WOULD DISAPPROVE OF THE ARTICLE OR WHY SOME COMMENTS SUGGEST THAT SUCH AN ANALYSIS IS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE

JUST A REMINDER THAT TZOLKIN SERVED AS AN OFFICER IN WWI AND I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OFFENDED BY THIS ANALYSIS WORK IS EXTREMELY METICULOUS AND I'M SURE THAT HE PUT AS MUCH THOUGHT INTO CONSTRUCTING HIS BATTLES AS HE DID THE REST OF HIS STORY EVEN IF HE DIDN'T USE THIS EXACT FRAMEWORK THAT THE WRITER PROPOSES
I LOVE THE MOVIES BUT TO ME WORST CRIME WAS HOW HE ENDED THIS BATTLE WITH THE ARMY OF THE DEAD A GIANT WAVE OF ECTOPLASM THAT RENDERED ANYTHING OUR HEROS DID POINTLESS LIKE HAD THEY JUST ARRIVED SOONER NO ONE WOULD EVEN HAVE TO FIGHT IT WAS MEN'S TACTICS FIGHTING ABILITY AND SPIRIT THAT WON THE THE DAY NOT AN INVINCIBLE ARMY OF GHOSTS THANKS FOR THIS POST A REALLY COOL AND INTERESTING READ
HA REALLY INTERESTING I'M GUESSING YOU'RE A MILITARY MAN ANY OTHER BLOGS LIKE THIS TO READ
I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T MENTION THE RELIEF OF VIENNA
SHE WAS AIDED BY A GUERRILLA FIGHTER NAMED MERRY A HOBBIT

THAT WOULD HAVE MADE MERRY SO PROUD
REALLY AWESOME READ
I WOULD DEFINITELY READ MORE ANALYSES IN THIS VEIN PARTICULARLY OF DEEP
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS SILLIER EITHER THE ARTICLE OR MODERN WAR FIGHTING THEORY

IT WAS GOOD FUN
VERY INTERESTING AND FUNNY READ I LAUGHED HARD AT SHE WAS AIDED BY A GUERRILLA FIGHTER NAMED MERRY A HOBBIT
EPW A COLD MODERN MILITARISTIC BREAKDOWN OF A BEAUTIFUL CLASSIC WORK OF ART NO THANK YOU YOU COULD LOOK AT SEPARATE PARTS THROUGH WHATEVER RANDOM LENS YOU WANT BUT THE WRITINGS ARE MEANT TO BE EXPERIENCED AS A WHOLE SELF CONTAINED WITHIN MIDDLE EARTH ANY EXTERNAL COMPARISON ONLY TAINTS THAT EXPERIENCE
OME NICE
WAY COOL
THAT'S AWESOME THIS GIVEN ME AN IDEA FOR A WALL IN MY BASEMENT
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A BLAST
THIS IS GREAT HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO COMPLETE
SO AWESOME
THESE ARE GREAT KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
I TOO VERY MUCH ENJOYED THE LIGHT SABER BATTLES IN ROK
THANKS HETP
I LOVE THE LAST ONE ANYTHING WITH MY TWO FAVORITE SERIES YOU SHOULD TRY AND MAKE A DARTH SARON WALLPAPER TOO
WHAT DOES THE WRITING SAY ON THE OSGILIATH ONE
THAT WAS REALLY WELL DONE HE DID A GREAT JOB FINDING ALL THE EXACT SPOTS FROM THE FILM AND MATCHING THEM WITH THE HIS OWN FOOTAGE THE ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT BOOK HE USED THE SAME ONE I USED WHEN I DID A SIMILAR TRIP IN NEW ZEALAND IS THAT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHERE TO FIND THE MOUNTAINS THAT MINAS TIGRISH WAS DIGITALLY PLACED IN JUST LIKE ISGENGAURD WAS I FOUND IT BY ACCIDENT AND IT WAS THE MOUNTAIN RANGE LEADING TO MT COOKE NOT MY PHOTO
JUST IN CASE ANYONE IS WONDERING MOST OF NZ HAS SEALED WIDE ROADS THESE GUYS JUST HAPPEN TO GO TO SOME OF THE MOST REMOTE PLACES WHERE THERE ARE LOOSE METAL ROADS
WELL THAT WAS LOVELY TO WATCH I'M TOLD THAT THE OWNER OF THE FEATHERTOP LOCATION ISN'T INTERESTED IN HAVING PEOPLE ON HIS LAND SO MY HOPES HAVE BEEN A LITTLE DASHED THERE THERE'S A FEW OBVIOUS SPOTS THAT HE'S MISSED THE SCENE OF DREAM IS JUST OUTSIDE WELLINGTON IN THE UPPER HUTT AND VERY EASY TO GET TO FOR EXAMPLE THE MADORA LAKES ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO A FANGORN FOREST LOCATION AND I RATHER THINK THE EASTERN SIDE OF MT RUAPEHU WOULD YIELD SOME ACCESSIBLE SITES


INTERESTING THAT IT WAS ALL DONE WITHOUT TOURS COMMENDABLE BUT THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR TOURS THAT WILL TAKE YOU RIGHT TO THE SPOT WITHOUT SPENDING A DAY SEARCHING IT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS TO FIND ALL THE SITES ON MOUNT VICTORIA FOR EXAMPLE AND A TOUR AT POLEBURN WOULD HAVE SAVED A LOT OF SEARCHING FOR SITES LIKE THE ORC CANYON WHICH IS ON PRIVATE LAND THERE S A LOT TO BE SEEN IN PARADISE ON PRIVATE LAND WITH FAIRLY CHEAP TOURS

BUT THANKS FOR POSTING A NICE HOUR OR SO OF REMINISCING
I'M DRUNK AND IT TOOK ME ENTIRELY TOO LONG TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS ABOUT A DANISH PERSON AND NOT ABOUT A GREAT DANE DOG
WHILE SOME OF THE FACTS ARE COOL AND I ACTUALLY NEVER KNEW I HAD TO PAUSE IT OVER AND OVER TO READ THE TEXT AND THE MUSIC WAS JUST CANCER LIKE THIRD STAGE TERMINAL CANCER
TRY THE END OF ALL THINGS MAYBE

HERE'S HIS DEVIANT ART PAGE FOR THOSE WHO ALSO DISLIKE THE CLICK BAIT
THIS GUY ALSO DOES WORLD OF WARCRAFT ART IN THIS STYLE HIS ILLUSTRATION OF TR DRAENEI ORIGIN STORY IS A FAVORITE OF MINE
I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE PRINTS FOR A FRIEND OF MINE THEY'RE PRICEY BUT AMAZING IN PERSON
BILBO BAGGIES BIRTHDAY
NO BUZZFEED BAD BUZZFEED
I AM THINKING ABOUT GETTING SOME OF THIS INKED UP IT IS SO COOL GATES OF ARGONAUT THAT'S WHAT'S UP
I'M GOING TO SAY THIS CAREFULLY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE IT A REFLECTION ON THE ARTIST'S TALENT THESE HAVE BEEN POSTED MANY TIMES BEFORE

AS NICE AS THEY ARE THERE IS SOMETHING A BIT SAD ABOUT HOW EVEN WITH ALL OF THE CREATIVITY INVOLVED THEY ARE STILL SIMPLY IMAGES TAKEN FROM THE FILMS RATHER THAN THE ARTIST'S IMAGINATION THE FILMS SEEM TO HAVE STIFLED A LOT OF ORIGINALITY WHEN IT COMES TO ARTIST'S CONCEPTIONS OF THE PLACES AND CHARACTERS OF MIDDLE-EARTH
AWESOME
CHECK OUT FELLOWSHIP
PRODUCT

OR DUNGEON WORLD WITH SOME CUSTOM PLAYBOOKS THERE ARE SOME USEFUL ONES CALLED THE DWARF THE ELF THE HALFLING WHICH MIGHT INTEREST YOU
SOO HOW COULD THIS WORK BECAUSE THIS SOUNDS FUN
I AND MAYBE OTHERS MIGHT BE TOO LATE FOR GAME SO I'VE CREATED A TOR GROUP ON ROLL IF ANYONE IS INTERESTING IN A GAME IN THE FUTURE


AS FAR AS I CAN TELL PERHAPS THE ONLY EXPLICIT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT OCCURS TO A BODY WHEN IT DIES CAN BE FOUND IN THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE WHEN SAURURAN IS KILLED

TO THE DISMAY OF THOSE THAT STOOD BY ABOUT THE BODY OF SAURURAN A GREY MIST GATHERED AND RISING SLOWLY TO A GREAT HEIGHT LIKE SMOKE FROM A FIRE AS A PALE SHROUDED FIGURE IT LOOMED OVER THE HILL FOR A MOMENT IT WAVERED LOOKING TO THE WEST BUT OUT OF THE WEST CAME A COLD WIND AND IT BENT AWAY AND WITH A SIGH DISSOLVED INTO NOTHING

FRODO LOOKED DOWN AT THE BODY WITH PITY AND HORROR FOR AS HE LOOKED IT SEEMED THAT LONG YEARS OF DEATH WERE SUDDENLY REVEALED IN IT AND IT SHRANK AND THE SHRIVELED FACE BECAME RAGS OF SKIN UPON A HIDEOUS SKULL LIFTING UP THE SKIRT OF THE DIRTY CLOAK THAT SPRAWLED BESIDE IT HE COVERED IT OVER AND TURNED AWAY

WE MIGHT PRESUME THAT THE BARONG BEING A MAIA AND CLOTHED IN A PHYSICAL BODY IN THE SAME MANNER MIGHT HAVE SUFFERED A SIMILAR FATE I SUSPECT THAT EVEN IF THE SHRIVELED CARCASS REMAINED IT WOULD BE LARGELY INACCESSIBLE TO ANY WHO WISHED TO RETRIEVE IT IT COULD PROBABLY ONLY BE REACHED VIA THE ENDLESS STAIR WHICH UNTIL GANDALF CONFIRMED IT'S EXISTENCE WAS LONG LOST GANDALF WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD PUT TO FIND IT AGAIN GIVEN THE ROUTE HE TOOK TO ARRIVE THERE AND NO OTHER LIVING BEING WOULD HAVE EVEN SEEN IT BEFORE
I THINK EVEN IF THE BODY LINGERED THERE NO ONE WOULD EVER FIND IT THE BODY IS PROBABLY LAYING SOMEWHERE ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE BUT NEAR THE HIGHEST PEAK WHERE THEY FOUGHT THAT SPOT WOULDN'T BE ACCESSIBLE EXCEPT THROUGH THE ENDLESS STAIR WHICH GIMLI SAYS WAS ONLY KNOWN TO DWARVES IN LEGEND GANDALF ONLY FOUND IT BY PURSUING THE BARONG

NO ONE WOULD FIND THAT BODY
BUT I THOUGHT THE NEW SHADOW WAS NEVER PUBLISHED SO WHAT EVENTS DO YOU MEAN
THIS WAS COOL THANKS FOR LINKING IT I LISTENED TO THIS PODCAST ALL THROUGH THEIR KINGS OF ENGLAND SERIES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
THE TZOLKIN BESTIARY BY DAVID DAY HAS SOME REALLY UNIQUE ARTWORK I WOULDN'T SAY ITS BETTER THAN WHAT HOWE OR LEE HAVE DONE BUT PERSONALLY I THINK IT LOOKS NICER THAN THE HILDEBRANDT THEIR CHARACTERS ARE TOO DOUGHY
ROGER LOCATIONS OF MIDDLE EARTH PAINTINGS ARE TOP NOTCH I THINK THERE'S ONLY A FEW OF THEM THOUGH I'VE SEEN THEM IN THE VINTAGE POSTCARD BOOK MIDDLE EARTH A BOOK OF POSTCARDS I'D ALSO RECOMMEND THE OTHER POSTCARD BOOKS FOR A VARIETY OF VISIONS OF MIDDLE EARTH FROM DIFFERENT ARTISTS HOBBIT AND DRAGONS AND MONSTERS THEY POP UP ON AMAZON EVERY NOW AND THEN
YOU'VE PROBABLY ALREADY HEARD OF TED NAISMITH BUT HIS SILMARILLION ILLUSTRATIONS ARE REALLY GREAT IN THE HARDCOVER SILMARILLION BOOK
IF YOU CAN GET HOLD OF SOME EARLY ISSUES OF MYTHLORE ORCRIST OR TZOLKIN JOURNAL PUBLISHED BEGINNING IN THE LATE SIXTIES THERE ARE WONDERFUL LINE DRAWINGS BY TIM KIRK ANNETTE HARPER AND STEPHEN PEREGRINE AMONG OTHERS

I ALSO ENJOY MICHAEL DRAWINGS IN HIS A JOURNAL AND A WALK THROUGH THE SHIRE PUBLISHED BY RUNNING PRESS IN THE LATE SEVENTIES EARLY SOUTH GREEN HAS SOME ARTWORK IN THE DAVID DAY BOOKS ALSO CIRC

A TZOLKIN ARTIST CURRENTLY DOING BEAUTIFUL WORK AND WHOSE LOOK IS NOT BASED ON THE FILMS IS JENNY DOLMEN I BELIEVE SHE HAS HER OWN WEBSITE NOW AND YOU CAN ALSO FIND HER WORK ALONG WITH LOADS OF OTHER GREAT TZOLKIN ILLUSTRATIONS AT
EVERY TIME I READ THIS QUOTE I ALWAYS HEAR THAT SOFT MUSIC THAT PLAYS AS GANDALF SAYS THIS ONE OF MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE PARTS OF THE SERIES
MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE QUOTE AS I GET OLDER I PONDER DEATH MORE AND MORE ANYTIME I START TO GET ANXIETY ABOUT IT I REMEMBER THIS QUOTE IT ALWAYS EASES THE FEAR
BEST LINE IN THE WHOLE MOVIE I KNOW PETER JACKSON GETS A BUM WRAP BUT THE FIRST TRILOGY WAS SO WELL DONE AND PROFOUND HELPED ADOLESCENT ME FIGURE OUT A LOT ABOUT LIFE
THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD

NO NOT AT ALL
CHILLS EVERY TIME
WHEN THEY WROTE THIS LINE FOR THE MOVIE DO YOU THINK THE WRITERS WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FAR GREEN COUNTRY FRODO SEES AT THE END OF THE BOOK WAS AN AFTERLIFE BECAUSE IT ISN'T IT'S TOL ERRESEA A PLACE FRODO AND BILBO WILL GO TO LIVE OUT THE REST OF THEIR DAYS PICKY DETAIL BUT I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT THEY FOUND SOME KIND OF WAY OF INCLUDING THE BEST LINE IN THE MOVIE WITHOUT RESORTING TO NARRATIVE VOICEOVER
WHY IS THE TEXT SEGMENTED INTO SUCH AWKWARD PARTS SORRY BUT IT FEELS AWKWARD TO READ
DAT FORMATTING THO
EVERY TIME I SEE THIS QUOTE I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I'M IN R LOAR I PRAY EVERY TIME IT'S NOT ACCOMPANIED BY BAD NEWS
I READ THIS TO MY FRIEND AT HIS FUNERAL HE WAS A GREAT TZOLKIN DEVOTEE IT IS FOR ME A HOPE WE ALL MAY SEE WHEN IT IS OUR TIME
WHILE I LOVE THE QUOTE I HATE HOW IT WAS USED IN THE MOVIE
I FEEL LIKE IT GOES WITH THE SONG END AND THEY TAKE QUOTES FROM GANDALF IN THAT SONG FROM THE 3RD MOVIE AT THE END CREDITS
THIS WAS MY SENIOR YEARBOOK QUOTE
THAT PART WITH THE CURTAIN MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT HE MUST HAVE DROPPED ACID AT LEAST ONCE
I HATE THIS SCENE IT THE BIG LIE ORGANIZED RELIGION TRIES TO BUY YOU OFF WITH GANDALF IS DESCRIBING AN AFTERLIFE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL LEFT IN THE STORY WHERE IT BELONGS

EDIT LINE BREAK
WONDERFUL READING I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO PLAYING MORE OF THESE

HOBBIT LOAR SILMARILLION

WHY DO PEOPLE GET SO CONFUSED ABOUT THIS
HOBBIT LOAR SILK THEN LOAR AGAIN

R LOAR SEARCH Q READING ORDER ON
THE HOBBIT IS A LITTLE MORE LIGHT HEARTED AND EASIER QUICKER TO READ SO I USUALLY START WITH IT WHEN I'M THEM HOWEVER IF YOU READ THE LOAR TRILOGY FIRST YOU'LL NOTICE MORE OF THE SMALL THINGS BEING SET UP IN THE HOBBIT THAT MAKE WAY FOR THE TRILOGY I ALSO LIKE TO READ THE HOBBIT FIRST BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WORKS CHRONOLOGICALLY

I DEFINITELY AGREE THAT YOU SHOULD READ ALL OF THOSE BEFORE TAKING A CRACK AT THE SILMARILLION IT'S KIND OF DRY A LOT OF HARD TO REMEMBER NAMES AND YOU'LL PROBABLY GET BORED OR CONFUSED EARLY ON AND QUIT IF YOU TRY IT FIRST THE HOBBIT LOAR WILL GET YOU HOOKED ENOUGH TO WANT TO TACKLE ALL THE HISTORY IN THE SILMARILLION
I STARTED OUT WITH THE HOBBIT AS A H SOUTH FRESHMAN WHEN WE HAD TO READ IT FROM THERE I WENT ON TO LOAR THEN THE SILMARILLION THE SILMARILLION IS NOT DIFFICULT NOR HARD TO READ UNLESS YOU JUST DON'T LIKE IT IT'S A GOOD EASY READ TO ME MANY PEOPLE SIMPLY DO NOT LIKE IT YOU MAY BE ONE OF THE FEW OF US WHO DO LIKE IT AND WON'T HAVE TO FORCE YOURSELF TO READ IT TIME WILL TELL I'D SAY GO WITH THE HOBBIT FIRST AND THEN LOAR THE HOBBIT IS A REALLY GOOD AND QUICK READ ANYWAY AND IS ALMOST LIKE AN INTRODUCTION TO LOAR BUT NOT SO MUCH SO LOAR FLESHES EVERYTHING OUT MAKE SURE YOU READ THE APPENDICES WHEN YOU'RE DONE
HOBBIT LORD OF THE RINGS THEN SILMARILLION
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD YOU SHOULD READ THEM LOAR THE HOBBIT SILMARILLION

SILMARILLION IS SAID TO BE REALLY CONFUSING IF YOU HAVEN'T READ LOAR
HE'S ONLY MONTHS
FEET AREN'T HAIRY ENOUGH
THAT IS ONE BEAUTIFUL KID
WHEN DO WE STOP COUNTING MONTHS ISN'T IT EASIER TO SAY YOUR ONE YEAR OLD
ADORABLE

I'M INTERESTED IN HUMAN GENETICS HE LOOKS VERY MIXED WHAT IS HE
YOUR SON IS
YES HE WAS THAT'S BADASS HOPEFULLY HE ONLY GROWS A COUPLE MORE FEET AND FINDS A WAY TO A MAGICAL LAND
AW THAT'S PRECIOUS
GET THAT KID A BIT OF HAIR ON HIS TOES AND YOU'RE IN
CUTEST LITTLE GUY HE'D GET ALL THE TREATS FROM ME JUST ADORABLE

JUST GET SOME CHIPS POPCORN TO EAT AND MOUNTAIN DEW TO DRINK
DRAIN YOUR VESSEL EVERYTIME FRODO FALLS OVER
BY THE TIME YOU GET TO ROK DRINK WHENEVER SAM GIVES FRODO THE LOOK

OR WHEN FRODO SAYS SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF OH IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL
DRINK WHEN SAM CALLS FRODO MR FRODO
DON'T FORGET TO DRINK WHEN YOU SEE PETER JACKSON
MY AVES ARE WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS PRECIOUS IN REFERENCE TO THE RING

AND AND I ADMIT IT'S LESS SIMPLE BUT NOT THAT HARD

WHEN THERE IS A PANORAMIC SHOT OF THE LANDSCAPE

IT IS AMAZING JUST HOW MANY OF THOSE THERE ARE
THAT IS DEFINITELY A WHITE FLOWER
IS IT SO IMPROBABLE THAT THE LANDMASS OF MIDDLE EARTH COULD BE OVER MILES ACROSS
IN NÚMENÓREAN LINEAR MEASURES IT IS SAID

MEASURES OF DISTANCE ARE CONVERTED AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE INTO MODERN TERMS LEAGUE IS USED BECAUSE IT WAS THE LONGEST MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCE IN NÚMENÓREAN RECKONING WHICH WAS DECIMAL FIVE THOUSAND HANGAR FULL PACES MADE A LAR WHICH WAS VERY NEARLY THREE OF OUR MILES LAR MEANT PAUSE BECAUSE EXCEPT IN FORCED MARCHES A BRIEF HALT WAS USUALLY MADE AFTER THIS DISTANCE HAD BEEN COVERED THE NÚMENÓREAN ANGA WAS SLIGHTLY LONGER THAN OUR YARD APPROXIMATELY THIRTY-EIGHT INCHES OWING TO THEIR GREAT STATURE THEREFORE FIVE THOUSAND HANGAR WOULD BE ALMOST EXACTLY THE EQUIVALENT OF YARDS OUR LEAGUE YARDS TWO FEET AND FOUR INCHES SUPPOSING THE EQUIVALENCE TO BE EXACT
WELL YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT GANDALF SAID IT WAS LEAGUES OR MORE FROM TO ORTHANT WITH A STRAIGHT FLIGHT I GUESS MY PROBLEM IS HOW FAST THE CHARACTERS TRAVEL IN CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF TIME
THIS LOOKS AMAZING ALREADY PLEASE POST THE FINAL RESULT AS WELL
LOOKING VERY AWESOME LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE FINISHED PIECE

I'LL BE IN IRELAND IN 2 WEEKS WILL HAVE TO PLOT THIS ON THE MAP AND MAKE A VISIT
I'VE LIVED IN IRELAND MY ENTIRE LIFE AND I'M ONLY FINDING OUT ABOUT THIS PUB NOW OP DO YOU KNOW WHEN IT OPENED

I LIKE THAT THE MAP OF THE SHIRE ON THE SIGN IS FROM THE GAME LORD OF THE RINGS ONLINE

WONDER WHAT PERMISSIONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO USE THAT TZOLKIN ESTATE OR TURBINE GAMES
UNRELATED BUT JULIA LOOKS A HELL OF A LOT LIKE HILARY KNIGHT
FOR NO REASON I NOTICED SHE IS USING HER HAND TO BLOCK THE SUN FROM HER EYES BUT SHE IS NOT ACTUALLY BLOCKING ANY SUN FROM HER EYES
LOCK IT DOWN NOW
I HOPE YOU LOCATE THE REST OF THE FAMILY PRAYING FOR THEM OP

FIRST PICTURE IS THAT MATT BOMER
PLEASE LET THEM KNOW THEY ARE LOVED BUNCHES BY AN IRISH WELSH AMERICAN FAMILY HERE IN MIDDLE GEORGIA WE WILL MAKE IT OVER THERE SOME DAY AND I HOPE THEIR FINE ESTABLISHMENT IS STILL THERE SO I CAN BUY IT IN PINTS
NO IT COMES FROM THE LIST OF DWARVES IN THE VOLUSPA PART OF THE ELDER EDDA OF ICELANDIC POETRY
NO BUT I GIVE YOU AN UNVOTE FOR HONEST QUESTION
FROM THE INSTAR IN UNFINISHED TALES

GANDALF IS A SUBSTITUTION IN THE ENGLISH NARRATIVE ON THE SAME LINES AS THE TREATMENT OF HOBBIT AND DWARF NAMES IT IS AN ACTUAL NORSE NAME FOUND APPLIED TO A DWARF IN VÖLUSPÁ USED BY ME SINCE IT APPEARS TO CONTAIN ANDR A STAFF ESPECIALLY ONE USED IN MAGIC AND MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO MEAN ELVISH WIGHT WITH A MAGIC STAFF GANDALF WAS NOT AN ELF BUT WOULD BE BY MEN ASSOCIATED WITH THEM SINCE HIS ALLIANCE AND FRIENDSHIP WITH ELVES WAS WELL-KNOWN SINCE THE NAME IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE NORTH IN GENERAL GANDALF MUST BE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT A ESTRON NAME BUT ONE MADE UP OF ELEMENTS NOT DERIVED FROM ELVISH TONGUES
ONLY THE FELLOWSHIP HMM A DIFFERENT FRODO FRODO IS OVER YEARS OLD AND WITH ELIJAH WOOD AS FRODO IT MADE IT LOOK HE WAS JUST ABOUT OR AND HE MAKES AWKWARD FACES

FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE SERIES I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A DIFFERENT ELROD ALL I HEAR IS BRING FORTH THE RING MR ANDERSON
WOULD HAVE CHANGED SEAN BEAN AS BOOMIER
BIG SPOILER
THIS SUB IS FUCKING TRASH
LOVE THE HAIRY FOOTIES
THEY WOULD BE SMALL ONLY CHILDREN TO YOUR EYES
HOW CUTE LEAVING FOR AN ADVENTURE
WOULD YOU SAY THAT THEY ARE YOUR PRECIOUS
MERRY AND PIPPIN
UM ARE YOU ALL OK STING IS GLOWING BLUE DID YOU ALL MAKE IT AWAY FROM THE ORCS OK

SERIOUSLY WELL DONE COSTUMES LOVE IT
PARENTING DONE RIGHT
R PHOTOSHOPBATTLES
I THINK THERE IS STILL A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR A SKYRIN WITCHER TYPE GAME SET IN MIDDLE EARTH
LATRO 2 I WOULD LOVE FOR IT TO RECEIVE A MODERN OVERHAUL
LORE WISE I WOULD LIKE THE NEXT GAME TO MENTION WHAT HAPPENS IN THE EAST WHO ARE THE BLUE WIZARDS WHAT ARE THEY DOING I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A LOT OF CONTENT THERE STORY WISE TO MAKE A DECENT GAME BE IT A STRATEGY GAME SIMILAR TO BEME WHICH I HAVE REINSTALLED ON MY PC OR PERHAPS SIMILAR TO A SHADOW OF MORDOR GAME I BELIEVE THAT IF VIDEOGAMES COMPAGNIES WANT TO OFFER US A GREAT TIME IT IS PRIMORDIAL FOR THEM TO OFFER US A GREAT STORY COMPLIMENTARY TO THE EVENTS OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS WHO ARE THE MENS OF THE EASTERN WHO ARE THE CORSAIRS THE ARAD THE MEN OF THE CHUN WHY AREN'T THE MEN OF DALE JOINING CONDOR IN THEIR FIGHT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE WESTERN REALMS OF CONDOR WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BLUE CONTAINS HOW DID MORIA FALL
ITM
THIS IS WHAT I PERSONALLY HAVE
IT'S PRETTY CHEAP ON EBAY AND LOOKS REALLY COOL ON DISPLAY
I WILL ADD THAT HAVING SPECIAL FEATURES DOESN'T RULE A BOSSET OUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARY BUT I WILL OF COURSE BUT A BOSSET THAT HAS ALL THE INTERVIEWS ETC AS LONG AS THE MOVIES ARE EXTENDED EDITIONS
DOES SHE HAVE A PLAYER IF SO THE GENERIC EXTENDED EDITION TRILOGY ON AMAZON IS PERFECT AND ISN'T RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE

I CHECKED THE HOBBIT ALL THREE LORD OF THE RINGS BOOKS AND LETTERS AND COULD ONLY FIND THE FOLLOWING

FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING CHAPTER 2 HE FRODO LOOKED AT MAPS AND WONDERED WHAT LAY BEYOND THEIR EDGES MAPS MADE IN THE SHIRE SHOWED MOSTLY WHITE SPACES BEYOND THEIR BORDERS

ALDO LEOPOLD WROTE THE FOLLOWING IN A SAND COUNTY ALMANAC AND SKETCHES HERE AND THERE

TO THOSE DEVOID OF IMAGINATION A BLANK SPACE ON THE MAP IS A USELESS WASTE TO OTHERS THE MOST VALUABLE PART
THIS SOUNDS SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR TO A LINE FROM PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN NOT SURE WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE READ IT THOUGH
FRODO TALKS ABOUT LEAVING BLANK PAGES FOR SAM IN THE RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH AT THE END OF THE FILMS MAYBE YOU MIXED UP BOOK FILM AND MAP BOOK HAHA JUST A STRETCH
I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT ARAGON AND HIS PEOPLE WERE THE OPPOSITE OF WEALTHY APART FROM A FEW SENTIMENTAL TREASURES WHICH I THINK WERE ACTUALLY IN THE CARE OF ELROD FOR MUCH OF HIS LIFE ARAGON WAS A WANDERER HE ATE WHAT HE KILLED OR FORAGED PRESUMABLY SOME OF THE NORTHERN DUNEDIN HAD SETTLEMENTS AND FARMED A BIT BUT AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE RANGERS ARE CONCERNED THE ONLY DESCRIPTIONS I RECALL INDICATE THAT THEY WERE WITHOUT HOME OR MEANS OF SUPPORT AND IN MANY WAYS RELIED ON STOPPING BY RIVENDELL EVERY NOW AND THEN AS FOR WHERE THEY GOT THEIR SPENDING CASH FOR CLOTHES FOOD WEAPONRY AND MAINTENANCE I WOULD ASSUME THEY TOOK WORK WHERE THEY COULD FIND IT THAT'S ALL SPECULATION ON MY PART THOUGH
THE RANGERS OF THE NORTH ARE DESCRIBED AS A TRIBE WITH A CHIEFTAIN SO PRESUMABLY THEY ARE A GROUP OF INTERCONNECTED FAMILIES OF DUNEDIN THAT PLEDGE FEALTY TO ARAGON II THE CHIEFTAIN AND HIS FAMILY LINE PRESUMABLY THEN RECRUITMENT FOR THE RANGERS IS SPECIFICALLY LIMITED TO THAT TRIBE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEY HAD MUCH OF ANY ECONOMY BEYOND SUBSISTENCE BUT IF THEY NEEDED SUPPLIES THEY DIDN'T HAVE LIKELY THEY EITHER DID BUSINESS WITH THE WITH THE DWARVES OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS WITH THE ELVES OF RIVENDELL OR WITH THE ELVES AT THE GREY HAVENS

ALSO CONSIDERING EVERY CHIEFTAIN OF THE DUNEDIN OF THE NORTH HAS BEEN FOSTERED AT RIVENDELL PRESUMABLY ELROD HAS SOME PRETTY CLOSE TIES TO THEM AND WAS A SOURCE OF WEAPONS AND HORSES THAT'S MY GUESS ANYWAY
IT IS NOT LIKE THEY NEEDED MUCH

THEY COULD LIVE OF THE LAND CRAFT THEIR OWN WEAPONS

THEY LIVE LONG THEY TRAIN THEMSELVES

KNOWLEDGE IS PASSED DOWN

ARAGON WOULD BE ONE OF THEIR PATRONS

THEY ARE HIS PEOPLE THEY ARE HIS PERSONAL FIGHTING FORCE
THERE'S A GOOD FREE MOVIE ON YOUTUBE CALLED BORN OF HOPE BY LOAR PREQUEL HOUR MINUTES LONG WITH MILLION VIEWS IT'S THE STORY OF THE DÚNEDAIN UNDER ARATHORN FATHER THIS MOVIE DOES A GOOD JOB IN ITS PORTRAYAL OF THE DÚNEDAIN

QINWCRM
I'M NOT SURE WHO WOULD PROVIDE THEIR FINANCES AN INTERESTING QUESTION BTW BUT AS FOR THE TRAINING I'D ASSUME THAT EACH GENERATION OF RANGERS WOULD TRAIN THE NEXT AND SIMPLY PASS DOWN THE KNOWLEDGE OR AT LEAST THAT'S THE MOST PLAUSIBLE IDEA I CAN THINK OF
ALSO HELLADIAN AND ELROHIR JOINED THE DUNEDIN ON NUMEROUS JOURNEYS SO THEY MAY ALSO HAVE PROVIDED THEM WITH NECESSITIES BUT WHAT A SERIOUSLY GREAT QUESTION I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT TO QUESTION THAT
IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE AS MUCH AS WE ALL LOVE TZOLKIN HE DIDN'T DO A STELLAR JOB OF EXPLAINING THE ECONOMIES OF MIDDLE EARTH WE KNOW THEY HAD SOME OF THEIR OWN VILLAGES AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE RANGERS WERE ONLY ONE PART OF THE DUNEDIN I AM SURE ELROD HELPED CARE FOR THE DUNEDIN WHILE THE PEOPLE OF BREE MIGHT HAVE HAD MIXED FEELING ABOUT THE RANGERS I AM SURE OTHER VILLAGES TOWNS AND FARMS WERE MORE OPEN TO TRADING WITH THEM
NEEDS SOME FUZZY LITTLE FEET
AWESOMESSEES
THIS TYPE OF QUESTION IS ALWAYS UNFAIR BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS HIGHLY CIRCUNSTANCIAL FOR EXAMPLE PERGOLAS COULD EASILY SHOOT ARAGON WITH A BOW BUT ARAGON IS MOST LIKELY THE BEST SWORDSMAN THERE IS NO WAY TO GET A RIGHT ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
PERGOLAS IS INCREDIBLY AGILE SO I FEEL AS IF HE COULD KEEP HIS DISTANCE FROM ARAGON AND JUST SHOOT ARROWS AT HIM UNTIL ENOUGH STICK
ARAGON IS MUCH MORE SKILLED WITH A BLADE THAN PERGOLAS EVEN WITH SPEED ARAGON IS MUCH BETTER WITH A BLADE
START HERE READ THROUGH ALL OF THE POSTS ABOUT ARAGON THEN GO HERE READ THROUGH ALL THE POSTS ABOUT PERGOLAS THEN COME BACK AND TELL US WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED U ALGORIDDEN
FAIR FIGHT ARAGON PRISON RULES PERGOLAS
A NUMENORIAN OF STRONG BLOOD VS A WOOD ELF OF ALSO STRONG BLOOD I THINK PERGOLAS DUE TO HIM BEING PROBABLY PHYSICALLY STRONGER AND FASTER THAN ARAGON THE BOOKS DON'T GO INTO A WHOLE LOT OF DETAIL ON HOW BADASS PERGOLAS IS BUT IF HE IS A TENTH LIKE THOSE OF LINE ARAGON DOESN'T STAND A CHANGE FEASOR TOOK DOWN GOTHMOG BARONG COMMANDER THAT SARON SERVED AND HIS BODYGUARD RETINUE OF BARONGS JUST SAYING
MY FATHER HAD AN ACCOMPANIMENT FOR HIS AUDIO CASSETTES I REMEMBER USING IT WHEN I WAS ILL AS A BOY IN THE SOUTH IT FOLLOWED THE JOURNEY AND MIGHT HAVE MORE INFORMATION TOO BUT I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER

MY FATHER WAS A HUGE LOAR FAN AND PASSED THIS PAST FEBRUARY I'D COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE BOOK IM VISITING MY MOTHER THIS SATURDAY AND WILL TRY AND FIND IT AND POST SOME PICTURES IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF MEDIEVAL ENGLAND MIGHT BRING IT TOGETHER MORE AND A DIKE IN THIS CASE IS A DITCH NOT A WALL
YES YOUR IMAGINATION
I FULLY UNDERSTAND PEOPLE HERE DO NOT LIKE THE MOVIES

YOU'RE OFF YOUR ROCKER IF YOU THINK PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE LOAR FILMS EVEN US NERDS OVER ON R TOLKIENFANS LIKE THE LOAR FILMS

WHERE DID YOU GET A SILLY IDEA LIKE THAT

SURE ONE DAY I'D LOVE AN HBO STYLE LONG FORM SERIES THAT PAINSTAKINGLY REPRODUCES EVERY LITTLE DETAIL POEM TOM BOBADIL AND THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE BUT JACKSON DID A FINE JOB WITH HIS FIRST TRILOGY


GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT FELLOWSHIP IS PROBABLY STILL MY FAVOURITE OF THE THREE BUT TNT AND ROK EXPAND THE WORLD QUITE A BIT AND EVERYONE BRINGS A STELLAR PERFORMANCE OF WHAT THEY'RE GIVEN WHEN I RECATCH THE FILMS I'M ALWAYS SURPRISED BY THE EXCELLENT CASTING SOME CHARACTERS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOK BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STORY TOLD IN THE FILMS THEY KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK
IT WAS A GREAT FINALE TO THE SERIES

HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU THINK THE MOVIE HAD ENDED WHEN I SAW IT IN THEATRES THE AUDIENCE GOT OUT OF THEIR CHAIRS FOUR TIMES I THINK IT WAS THOSE DARN
I DO FIND IT INTERESTING THAT A LOT OF THE MOVIE IS FROM THE TWO TOWERS BOOK HECK EVEN THE END OF FELLOWSHIP IS FROM THE TWO TOWERS
I THINK ALMOST EVERYONE LIKES THE LOAR TRILOGY IT'S THE HOBBIT TRILOGY THAT GETS A LOT OF HATE I LOVE ALL THINGS LOAR THEMED THOUGH AND STILL ENJOYED THE HOBBIT SERIES BUT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS THE FIRST SERIES
I THINK SO MUCH NEGATIVITY COMES FROM DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF MEDIA AND THE FARTHER WE GET FROM THE RELEASE THE LESS WE REALIZE HOW GOOD THESE MOVIES WERE THAT BEING SAID I THINK THE LOAR TRILOGY WAS THE BEST BOOK TO FILM ADAPTATION I'VE SEEN CERTAIN ASPECTS HAVE TO BE CHANGED FOR TIMING AND FOR CONTEXT BUT IN GENERAL BRINGING A WORLD TO LIFE THE LOAR SERIES DID THIS PROBABLY BETTER THEN ANY OTHER SERIES I KNOW HP WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD TRY AND MAKE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES THE ACTING SOUND MUSIC SCENERY ARE SOME OF THE BEST THAT REALLY PUT YOU IN MIDDLE EARTH
YES
ALL THOSE THINGS YOU MENTIONED YES ALSO WHEN THE RIDERS OF ROHAN FILL UP THE ENTIRE SCREEN IT GIVES ME CHILLS EVERY TIME
I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME WATCHING THE CHARGE OF THE ROHIRRIM IN THE PELENNOR FIELDS YEARS AGO TALK ABOUT ADRENALINE PORN
AFTER THAT BATTLE SHE IS HEALED BY ARAGON SHE EVENTUALLY MARRIES FARAMIR AND THEY HAVE A CHILD
COLWYN MARRIES FARAMIR WHO IS RAISED TO THE PRINCE OF ITHILIEN BY ARAGON HIS HOUSE BECOMES THE 2ND GREATEST NOBILITY AFTER THE PRINCES OF DOL AGOROTH SHE AND FARAMIR MET IN THE HOUSES OF HEALING HER BROTHER ALSO MARRIED A DÚNADAN THEIR GRANDMOTHER MOREEN OF LOSSARNACH WAS A DÚNADAN WOMAN FROM DOL AGOROTH FROM THE HOUSE OF THE PRINCES UNCLE THRODDEN USED TO LIVE IN CONDOR WITH HIS PARENTS UNTIL HIS GRANDFATHER DIED AS YOU MAY NOTE COLWYN AND FARAMIR ARE ACTUALLY COUSINS VIA THEIR CONNECTION TO THE PRINCES OF DOL AGOROTH HIS MOTHER WAS SISTER
ONE OF THESE REQUIRES SO MUCH MORE EFFORT THAN THE OTHER LOOKS GREAT THOUGH
I SPY A WONDERFUL CARD GAME IN THE BACKGROUND
THAT IS SIMPLY AWESOME
BRILLIANT
YOU GUYS MADE ME SMILE TOO GOOD
THAT'S A VERY GOOD USE OF A POOL RING
ARE THOSE ALL THE DOMINION GAMES ON THE SHELF
THAT'S AMAZING
DELETED
THESE SCRUBS CAN'T EVEN GENDER THE MOON CORRECTLY

STOLEN ASSETS EVERYWHERE IF SOMEONE COULD FIND ME THE FOOTAGE FROM WHATEVER FIGHT THEY SUPERIMPOSED HELM ON AND MADE THAT'D BE GREAT
THIS IS JUST AWFUL
DIVINE PROVIDENCE
2 SARON TRIED OFFERING THE THREE REMAINING DWARVES RINGS BACK TO THE DWARVES IN EXCHANGE FOR INFORMATION ABOUT BILBO
MY TAKE ON LORD OF THE RINGS IS THAT A FAIR AMOUNT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN WAS FATED FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN ILLUVATAR SANG THE WORLD AND ITS PURPOSE INTO EXISTENCE ONLY MELIOR SANG A DIFFERENT SONG TO COUNTER THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE BUT I SUSPECT ILLUVATAR WAS FAR STRONGER TO TWIST IT TO HIS FAVOR SILMARILLION

2 THE RINGS WERE MADE FOR THE DWARVES AND THEY WERE TOO STUBBORN TO BE ANY USE TO SARON I BELIEVE THE OF THE RINGS WERE DEVOURED BY DRAGONS WHILE THE LAST WERE RETRIEVED BUT USELESS THE RINGS WERE TO CORRUPT THE USER TO BAUDRONS WILLIAM THEY HAD PROPERTIES TO MAKE THE HOLDER STRONGER IN SOME WAY BUT REALLY NO USE TO SARON
YEA READ THE SILMARILLION IT'S TOUGH THE FIRST TIME BUT IF YOU ARE LIKE MANY OF US YOU WILL END UP READING AT LEAST I LOVE IT AND HAVE PROBABLY READ IT ABOUT TIMES THERE IS SOMETHING NEW I PICK UP EVERY TIME USUALLY A ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS OR SO I'LL PICK IT UP
SO TO SUM IT UP OF THE DWARVES RINGS ARE DESTROYED BY DRAGONFIRE THE OTHER BY HOOK OR BY CROOK ENDED UP BACK IN POSSESSION THE DWARVES RINGS WERE DESIGNED TO AMPLIFY ONES LUCK PARTICULAR IN MONETARY GAINS BUT IT ALSO IMBUED THE HOLDER WITH INSANE GREED WHICH WOULD THEN LEAD TO MANIA AND OUTRIGHT EXTREME DISTRUST OF OTHERS THE RINGS WERE PART OF THE REASON MOST OF THE DWARVES KINGDOMS WERE NEVER UNITED SO IN ESSENCE THEY WERE VERY POWERFUL WEAPONS OF DISSENTION SARON OFFERS THE TO KING DAIN IRONFOOT FOR INFORMATION ABOUT BILBO AND THE RING DAIN BASICALLY TELLS HIM TO SHOVE THEM UP HIS ASS
THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AWESOME IDEA FOR LAURELING I WOULD GO FOR SOMETHING TRADITIONAL TO ITS COLOUR IT WAS THE GOLDEN TREE OF AMAN IF I REMEMBER THE FEMALE ONE HOWEVER I DON'T KNOW HOW GOLDEN LEAVES WILL LOOK I ONLY HAVE BLACK AND WHITE MYSELF THAT IS A QUESTION I WOULD TAKE UP WITH THE ARTIST MAYBE A FIERY ORANGE I THINK THAT WOULD LOOK GREAT ALONGSIDE THE COLORS OF TELPERION AS WELL AS BEING AS TZOLKIN CREATED IT TO BE
IF THE ELVES CAN'T TOLERATE SPOKEN WORD OF MORDOR THEN I DOUBT THAT THEY WOULD DO SO FOR ANYTHING TANGIBLE FROM IT EITHER EVEN MORE SO FOR OBJECTS CLOSE TO SARON

THE ARMOR MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST THAT ARMOR BUT WITH SARON IT'D BE TOO GREAT OF A RISK IN THE EYES OF THE ELVES I DOUBT EVEN UNDER IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES THEY'D REALLY WANT THE RING TO STAY
THE GONDORIANS WOULD LIKELY HAVE DESTROYED IT MELTED IT DOWN JUST A GUESS EITHER THAT OR THERE'S SOME AWESOME MUSEUM ON THE 6TH LEVEL OF MINAS TIGRISH WITH ALL THESE CRAZY RELICS ON DISPLAY
NOT IDLY DO THE LEAVES OF LORIEN FALL
WHY WOULDN'T YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S IN THE AUTUMN HONEST QUESTION WINTERTIME MAKES ME THINK OF SNOW BARE TREES ETC THIS HAS NONE OF THOSE THINGS
FOOL NO MAN CAN BE ME

WITCH KING

I AM NO MANUAL

U RAVENOUS
G PUTTING THAT TOGETHER
THIS IS SUPREMELY BADASS
LOVE YOUR NAILS
AWESOME COPLAY

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ENJOY FANFICTION AT ALL BUT IF YOU DO YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS RENDITION OF A GENDERSWAPPED WITCH KING
LOOKS AWESOME
WOW THIS IS HITE AND I SAY AGAIN THIS SUB IS ABSOLUTE TRASH
MY SIMPLIFIED TAKE ON THE WITCH KING LOOK MADE THE HELMET AND GLOVES AT HOME WITH BASIC CRAFT SUPPLIES TUTORIALS I USED GAUNTLET REFERENCE IMAGE GAUNTLET MAKING TUTORIAL BY THE WAY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GUY HIS TUTORIALS ARE REALLY EASY AND INTERESTING HELMET TEMPLATE HELMET TUTORIAL I'D PLANNED TO DO FULL ARM ARMOR BUT RAN OUT OF TIME MAYBE NEXT YEAR
YES THE SENTENCE IMPLIES THAT IT IS EITHER TOBACCO OR SOME KIND OF RELATIVE ALSO AT THE END OF THE HOBBIT BILBO PASSES A TOBACCO JAR WHICH PRETTY PUTS IT PRETTY CLEARLY
IN THE HOBBIT IT WAS SPECIFICALLY STATED TO BE TOBACCO

SINCE TOBACCO IS NATIVE TO CENTRAL AMERICA IT WAS OUT OF PLACE IN A STORY BASED IN AN ALTERNATE VERSION OF PRIMEVAL EUROPE SO TZOLKIN CHANGED IT TO THE MORE AMBIGUOUS PILEWEED BUT IT WAS STILL INTENDED TO BE SOME VARIETY OF TOBACCO THAT COINCIDENTALLY HAPPENED TO GROW IN MIDDLE EARTH
DEFINITELY A TOBACCO VARIETY
I JUST READ THE CHAPTER FLOTSAM AND JETSAM FROM TWO TOWERS LAST NIGHT WHICH INCLUDES THE BIT ABOUT LONGBOTTOM LEAF AND IN THAT CHAPTER IT IS REFERRED TO AS PIPE WEED BY THE CHARACTERS AND TOBACCO BY THE NARRATOR
GREAT ANSWERS LOAR PEOPLE AND WITHIN AN HOUR OF AM IN MY TIME ZONE
AND BY THE WAY MY NAME CHECKS OUT
EDIT SWAPPED COMMENTS FOR ANSWERS
TABACCO IS PRODUCED FROM TABACCO PLANTS LEAVES
THAT'S AWESOME WHERE DID THE DESIGN COME FROM
AMAZING IDEA
THAT IS A NICE DESIGN WAS IT YOU ASKING ABOUT THE PROPORTIONS OF GARSIL A FEW DAYS AGO
AWESOME THE WHITE TREE OF CONDOR IS MY PHONE BACKGROUND
THAT'S A GREAT DESIGN AND IT WORKS REALLY WELL AS A TATTOO INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE BUT LOOKS GOOD IN ITS OWN RIGHT NICE
THAT'S REALLY EXCELLENT
IT'S BEEN SITTING IN FRONT OF US FOR HOW LONG NOW AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN IT GREAT JOB GREAT TATTOO
HOLY FUCK THAT IS AWESOME I LOVE THAT SHIT
THAT IS RAD MAN LIKE THE PLACEMENT CHOICE AS WELL
I GOT A VERY SIMILAR TATTOO JUST A WEEK AGO LOVE THE DESIGN
THAT'S DOPE AS FUCK
WOW I NEVER THOUGHT I'D WANT A TATTOO BUT THIS IS MAKING ME RECONSIDER
I FLIPPING WISH
THAT'S REALLY GREAT NEVER SEEN THE ARTWORK BEFORE AND I LOVE IT PLUS IT WORKS AMAZING AS A TATTOO
I LITERALLY HAVE THE SAME TATTOO LOL

QUQRQ
REMOVED
I THINK HE WOULD TRY TO RALLY THE ROHIRRIM AND DEFENDED AT HELMS DEEP MAYBE OR HE WOULD TRAVEL NORTH TO ERECTOR TO RELIEVE THE SIEGE MAYBE WITH THE ROHIRRIM HELP AND THEN MARCH WITH THE MEN OF DALE AND EREGOTH IRON HILL AND ERECTOR DEARIES AND THE ELVES OF KIRKWOOD AND TRAVEL SOUTH TO DISTRACT SARON
DON'T FORGET THAT ARAGON IS THE KEY TO BRINGING DOWN SARON BEING ISILDURS HEIR AND AS HIS FATE IS INTERTWINED WITH FRODO DESTROYING THE RING I THINK THAT NO MATTER THE RESULTS OF THE HUGE BATTLES ARAGON AND FRODO WOULD HAVE PULLED IT OFFICIAL
THERE WAS NO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THAT
THAT'S NOT CREEPY THAT'S MILDLYINTERESTING
HE'S GONE VERY NO
WHATS WRONG WITH THE PHOTO LOOKS SPLOTCHY
I THOUGHT PEOPLE REALISED ON THE ORIGINAL POST THAT THIS WAS PHOTOSHOPPED
AND THEY SAID THAT I WAS CRAZY
THIS IS NO TREE

OOH AAH TERRIFYING
WOW THAT'S AWESOME
BECAUSE THE WEAPONS OF THE DEAD DO NOT HARM THE LIVING THEIR ONLY WEAPON IS FEAR THEY SUCCEEDED TO DRIVE AWAY THE SOUTHRONS AND CORSAIRS FROM LINGIER AND TO LIFT THE SIEGE OF PELARGI HUGE PORT CITY OF CONDOR BY SCARING THE ENEMY AWAY ARAGON ASSEMBLED AS LARGE HOST AS HE COULD IN THE TIME HE HAD AND SAILED FROM PELARGI TO PELENNOR WITH AN ARMY OF GONDORIAN SOLDIERS FROM SOUTHERN FIEFS

HE DID NOT TAKE THE ARMY OF THE DEAD WITH HIM EVEN TO THE PELENNOR FIELDS BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BE SURE THEY WERE SCARY ENOUGH CONSIDERING THAT THE RINGWRAITHS WITH THEIR HORRIBLE CAPTAIN WAS LEADING THE ENEMY HOSTS THE ENEMY WAS PROBABLY MORE AFRAID OF THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN OF THE DEAD MEN
I GUESS YOU'RE GOING BY THE FILM WHERE THE SPIRITS SERVE A VERY DIFFERENT PURPOSE COMPARED TO THE BOOK THEY DON'T ACTUALLY FIGHT IN A BATTLE AND THEIR PRIMARY WEAPON IS INSTILLING FEAR

AS FOR A FILM ANSWER I THINK YOU'LL BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND ONE THAT MAKES SENSE CIRC GIMLI EVEN REMARKS THEY SHOULDN'T BE RELEASED GUESS THEY HAD TO GET RID OF THE DEUS EX MACHINA THE GHOSTS WERE TURNED INTO OR THE BATTLE AT THE BLACK GATE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN VERY EXCITING
THE DEAD MEN OF DUNHARROW CAN ONLY FILL OTHERS WITH TERROR THEY CANNOT ACTUALLY DAMAGE OR HARM THE LIVING DIRECTLY THEIR ABILITY TO DO SO IN PJ'S ADAPTATION IS BY FAR MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT ABOUT HIS MOVIES IT REPLACES CAREFULLY CRAFTED EUCATASTROPHE WITH A MEDIOCRE DEUS EX MACHINA AND DESTROYS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR

NOT ONLY DOES IT ROB MEN OF THEIR FIRST GREAT VICTORY INSOFAR AS THE MOVIE PORTRAYS THEM AS ONLY WINNING BECAUSE OF THE DEAD MEN IT ALSO RENDERS ALL OF THE SACRIFICE AND VALOR OF THE ROHIRRIM WORTHLESS THE TRUTH IS IN PJ'S MOVIES ARRIVAL WITH THE DEAD MEN WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DECISIVE VICTORY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEOWMEN WAS ABLE TO REACH THE TOWER IN TIME OR NOT
THE MOVIE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE BOOKS IN THE BOOKS THEY ARE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE BATTLES

IN THE MOVIE YA IT MAKES NOT SENSE FOR THEM TO GO SO EARLY
EVEN IF THEY COULD ACTUALLY HARM THE LIVING WHICH THEY COULDN'T IN THE BOOKS ARAGON WOULD HAVE BEEN A LIER AND A BETRAYER OF THOSE THAT FIRST SWORE SERVICE TO HIM NOT MUCH OF A KING IF THAT IS THE WAY ONE WOULD START
THE FILM F ED IT UP UNFORTUNATELY THEY MADE IT SO THAT THEIR WEAPONS COULD ACTUALLY HURT THE ORCS THUS LEAVING THE GIANT POTHOLE THAT IS YOUR QUESTION

IN THE BOOKS THIS IS EASILY EXPLAINED THE DEAD COULDN'T PHYSICALLY HARM THE LIVING JUST INCITE FEAR THEY WERE BASICALLY SUPPORT FOR THE ROHIRRIM AND GONDORIANS TO DO THAT ACTUAL FIGHTING

GOD I LOVE THOSE MOVIES BUT THAT SCENE
DELETED
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU PUTTING ON IT
WOW HOW DID YOU GET THE FEET RIGHT

JUST KIDDING LOOKS GOOD
FAKE HOBBITS DON'T HAVE BEARDS
NICE
BE THANKFUL IT WASN'T COLD YOU'D HAVE FROZEN YOUR LITTLE HOBBITSES OFF
LOOKS GREAT
I I
I LIKE HOW THEY'RE ALL AWKWARDLY SITTING THERE AT FIRST THEY'RE ALL THINKING THE SAME THING FEELING SIMILAR EMOTIONS BUT WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY SAY WHAT DO THEY EVEN NEED TO SAY THEIR SHARED AND INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES WERE SO MONUMENTAL ALL THEY CAN DO IS TOAST EACH OTHER

THEN SAM SEES ROSIE AND IS LIKE FUCK THIS I BATTLED A GIANT SPIDER
ME AS WELL IT JUST SO PERFECTLY CAPTURED FEELING OUT OF PLACE STILL THE SAME AT THE SHIRE BUT SOMEHOW IT'S NOT THE SAME TO THEM WITH ALL THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH

I'VE HAD THAT FEELING AND IT IS SO PALPABLE IN THIS IS SCENE I LOVE IT
SO GOOD EVERYTHING IS BUSINESS AS USUAL IN THE SHIRE AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THOSE FOUR HAVE BEEN THROUGH THEY AREN'T THE SAME AND THEY NEVER WILL BE THE SHIRE IS RUINED AND HEY IS THAT ROSIE THEN THE MUSIC HITS AND THE VIEWER SMILES LIKE AND IDIOT AND EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT BEAUTIFUL
SO MUCH IS COMMUNICATED WITHOUT ANY DIALOGUE COUPLED WITH THE BRILLIANT SCORE WHAT AN AMAZING SCENE
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOMENT EVERYBODY IN THE SHIRE DOESN'T KNOW CARE WOULD BELIEVE THAT MIDDLE EARTH WAS EVER IN DANGER AND THAT THOSE PLAYED THEIR PART IN DEFENDING IT THEY ARE ALL HEROES THAT WILL CARRY MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SCARS FROM THEIR ADVENTURES BUT TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THAT PUB IT SEEMS TO BE A CASE OF OH YOU WERE GONE DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE
THEY ARE BACK FROM THE WAR THEY ARE NO LONGER THE BOYS THEY WERE THEY HAVE GROWN AND CHANGED AND THEIR HOMETOWN IS SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN THEY EVER REALIZED I LOVE THIS SCENE EVEN IF THE BOOK IS DIFFERENT
THIS SCENE SPEAKS TO ME ON A SPIRITUAL LEVEL
YEAH THIS WAS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY THEY COULD END IT WITHOUT DOING SCORING OF THE SHIRE IT IS A PICTURE PERFECT METAPHOR FOR SOLDIERS COMING HOME FROM WWI AND NOBODY AROUND THEM CARING
THEY ALL HAVE PTSD SEEN SOME SHIT
VETERANS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT THAT HOBBIT IS GOING TO DO WITH THAT PUMPKIN
I'M PRETTY SURE THE KIDS IN THE MARRIAGE SCENE ARE PETER JACKSONS
IS IT JUST ME OR IS THE HOBBIT WITH THE PUMPKIN ANDY SARKIS IF I'M RIGHT IT'S KIND OF LIKE GOLLUM HAS COME BACK HOME WITH THEM REBORN
EDIT LOOKS LIKE I MAY BE RIGHT
NEEDS MORE SCOURGING
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE MOVIE PASSED ON THE MILITARY CONFLICT AT THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK WHEN THE GUYS GET HOME AND FIND SAURURAN AND WORM-TONGUED RUNNING THE SHOW
KIND OF WEIRD CONSIDERING P JACKSON WAS WILLING TO JUST MAKE UP STUPID SHIT
ALL I WANT IS TO SEE LOAR PLAYED WITH A LIVE ORCHESTRA I JUST REALIZED LAST YEAR THAT THIS IS A THING AND I WANT TO SEE IT SO BADLY LIVING IN LA HOPEFULLY IT WILL HAPPEN
YOU TAKE ANY WORD AND IT WILL MEAN SOMETHING ELSE IN ANOTHER LANDAGE

ALSO NAGUAL IS WEIRD IT MIGHT TRANSLATE EXACTLY TO DELICATE ROSE BUT IT IS GRAMMATICAL WRONG LIKE SAYING ROSE DELICATE IF YOU GET WHAT I MEAN
NOT IN MIDDLE EARTH
THIS SHOULD BE IN R MILDLYINTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE
WELL TZOLKIN CERTAINLY DID A WITH THAT NAME
I WAS JUST PLAYING IN THE KURDISTAN PERSIAN AREA AND MY DAUGHTER WAS NAMED NAGUAL NICE COINCIDENCE
ALSO TURKISH
SERIOUSLY WHO IN THE WORLD DREW THE PIC IN COMMENT
PRETTY DAMN TIRING I IMAGINE SO MANY STAIRS
ARE WE TALKING POST DENETHOR OR DURING DENETHORS REIGN BECAUSE THE ANSWERS WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT
PROBABLY LIKE LIVING IN MT SAINT MICHEL OR ANY OLD EUROPEAN CITY THAT HAS MAINTAINED ITS OLDER ARCHITECTURE
SARON TOOK THE RINGS FROM THEM TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THEM WHILE HE WAS WITHOUT THE ONE I WOULD SAY THAT COULD FUNCTION AS A SORT OF COMMUNICATION
IF THE MOUTH WAS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM AND SPEAK HIS DEMANDS I GUESS IT ISN'T ENTIRELY ARE WRAITHS AFTER ALL AND SARON CAN PROBABLY COMMUNICATE THROUGH THE SPIRIT WORLD AND GUIDE MENTOR THEM THROUGH THEIR RINGS SIMILARLY TO HOW HE OCCASIONALLY TAUNTS THE RING BARER WHEN IT IS EQUIPPED
WASN'T THERE ALSO A PALANTIR IN MINAS ITHIEL OR IS THAT THE ONE THAT WAS USED IN BARAD DUR
DELETED
I'M PRETTY SURE MANY OF THE RACES SUCH AS ELVES AND DWARVES AND ORCS ALL PRECEDED TZOLKIN A LOT OF HIS WORK WAS INSPIRED BY OLD GERMANIC FOLKLORE I THINK
THE TZOLKIN ESTATE ALSO WON A COURT CASE AGAINST THE PUBLISHERS OF DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS OVER THE TERM HOBBIT WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE REFERED TO AS HALFLINGS IN STARTING WITH 2ND EDITION
GOOD QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT AFTER LOOKING AT A FEW WELL-KNOWN TABLETOP SETTINGS I CAME ACROSS THIS QUOTE ABOUT THE FORGOTTEN REALMS FANTASY SETTINGS POPULARISED IN THE S THROUGH DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS

THE REALMS IT WAS CREATED BY GAME DESIGNER ED GREENWOOD AROUND AS A SETTING FOR HIS CHILDHOOD STORIES

SOURCE FANNON SEAN PATRICK THE FANTASY ROLEPLAYING BIBLE 2ND EDWARD
HOBBIT LOAR SILMARILLION READ CHILDREN OF AURIN BOOK INSTEAD OF THE CHAPTER IN THE SIL

THEN OPTIONALLY READ THE HOBBIT AND LOAR AGAIN
THE HOBBIT LOAR THE SILMARILLION THAT IS THE USUAL ORDER

NOW THE CHAPTER IN THE SILMARILLION CALLED OF TARIN TURAMBAR IS BASICALLY THE STORY OF THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN SO YOU MAY WANT TO SWITCH THE CHAPTER FOR THE NOVEL

THE BOOKS ARE OFTEN DIFFERENT IN TONE THE HOBBIT IS A CHEERFUL FAIRYTALE FOR CHILDREN LOAR IS AN EPIC STORY AND THE SILMARILLION ALMOST READS AS A HISTORY BOOK
I WOULDN'T BOTHER BUYING THE CHILDREN OF AURIN WHILE IT'S COOL TO HAVE BOTH THE SILMARILLION AND UNFINISHED TALES TO A POINT HAVE THE STORY IN THEM ALREADY
I'M NOT SURE ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THE THEATRICAL EDITION EXISTS
YEAH I THOUGHT IT WAS EXTENDED TIL I BOUGHT THE NORMAL BTU RAYS AND DISCOVERED THE SCENE IN IT THOUGHT HE'D GIVEN ME THE EXTENDED DISC BY ACCIDENT
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT IS THEATRICAL
THIS BE THE HOUR WHERE WE DRAW SWORDS TOGETHER
ALL THREE MOVIES HETP
NOW FOR WRATH NOW FOR RUIN AND A RED DAWN


FORTH EORLINGAS



MAN I LOVED ALL OF SPEECHES ESPECIALLY THE ONE AT THE END OF ROK


THEY KNOW THEY ARE RIDING TO THE END OF THE WORLD THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO POWERS BEYOND THEIR IMAGINATION HAVE DECREED THAT THEIR WORLD WILL END AND THEY FIND THEIR COURAGE AND RIDE TO THE WORLD END



RIDE RIDE NOW RIDE NOW RIDE TO RUIN RIDE TO THE WORLD'S ENDING

DEATH DEATH DEATH
YEES

ART BY MATT FERGUSON INSPIRED BY THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE TWO TOWERS BY

IN MANY WAYS I ENJOYED THE HELMS DEEP BATTLE MORE THAN THE PELENNOR FIELDS
THE EUCATASTROPHY FACTOR WAS HIGHER TO ME
RESPECT TO MATT FERGUSON
LET THIS BE THE HOUR WHEN WE DRAW SWORDS TOGETHER
AND THEN SUDDEN AND TERRIBLE FROM THE TOWER ABOVE THE SOUND OF THE GREAT HORN OF HELM RANG OUT

ALL THAT HEARD THAT SOUND TREMBLED MANY OF THE ORCS CAST THEMSELVES ON THEIR FACES AND COVERED THEIR EARS WITH THEIR CLAWS BACK FROM THE DEEP THE ECHOES CAME BLAST UPON BLAST AS IF ON EVERY CLIFF AND HILL A MIGHTY HERALD STOOD BUT ON THE WALLS MEN LOOKED UP LISTENING WITH WONDER FOR THE ECHOES DID NOT DIE EVER THE HORNBLASTS WOUND ON AMONG THE HILLS NEARER NOW AND LOUDER THEY ANSWERED ONE TO ANOTHER BLOWING FIERCE AND FREE

HELM HELM THE RIDERS SHOUTED HELM IS ARISEN AND COMES BACK TO WAR HELM FOR THEOWMEN KING
EXCELLENT ARTWORK YET WHY IS THERE AN F PARKED IN FRONT OF THE WALL I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE WHO SEES THAT AM I
IS THERE A GALLERY OF THESE SOMEWHERE BESIDES THE TWO OTHERS LINKED IN THE COMMENTS THEY MAKE GREAT PHONE BACKGROUNDS
WHERE DOES ALL THIS DOPE ARTWORK COME FROM I BOUGHT POSTER FROM THE WETA WEBSITE A FEW MONTHS AGO BUT THEY HAD A RELATIVELY LIMITED SELECTION CAN SOMEONE START HITTING ME WITH SOME LINKS

PETEY I GOT PAID TODAY NO CONCERTS THIS WEEKEND AND I HAVE MY BIRTHDAY NEW YEARS EVE TICKETS PURCHASED ALREADY TIME TO BLOW SOME FUCKING CASH
COOL PIC THIS WAS THE MOST UNDERWHELMING PART OF THE BOOK WHEN COMPARED TO THE MOVIE
SOMETIMES I IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF THE HOBBIT WAS AS WELL DONE AS LOAR THEN I WEEP
THE HORN OF HELM HAMMER-HARD WILL SOUND IN THE DEEP ONE LAST TIME


I FEEL LIKE TZOLKIN WOULD BE CRINGING HARD AT THE PLACING OF THAT COMMA
I HAVE THIS SET AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL
BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPP
LOOK TO MY COMING
GREAT CAPTION QUOTE

THAT SENT A SHIVER DOWN MY SPINE AND NOW I HAVE GOOSEBUMPS HOLY SHIT
CHECK BACK HERE IN A FEW HOURS
WATCH V


THE MOST CINEMATIC VERSION YET
THAT'S QUITE THE NAME
THAT'S A CAT NOT A BABY
I'M AFTER THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE BTU RAY SET IN ESSENCE BUT THERE IS SOME AMBIGUITY AS TO WHICH INES ARE CORRECT ONE FOR BUT YET I SAW ONE SET FOR BOTH ON AMAZON
THE DISC SET WILL HAVE EVERYTHING BUT IS RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE NOT SURE WHAT EXACT ANSWERS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY FUCKING NICE IT'S SIMPLE AND BEAUTIFUL

COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO DISLIKES TATTOOS
LOOKS GREAT IT WAS AMONG MY OPTIONS WHEN CONSIDERING MY FIRST TATTOO BUT I UP WITH THE RING INSCRIPTION AROUND MY FOREARM SOMEDAY I WILL ADD THIS FOR SURE
LOL IT LOOKS MORE LIKE SLAG THE TERRIBLE
IT WOULD WEIGH ABOUT TEN POUNDS AND SMOTHER YOU IF YOU FELL ASLEEP READING IT
NOT THAT I'VE EVER SEEN THOUGH IT WOULD SEEM A LITTLE SILLY TO HAVE RIGHT WOULD YOU EXPECT TO SEE THE SILMARILLION BOUND UP WITH IT IN THE SAME VOLUME
THAT'S AMAZING THANK YOU
ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN
ON DOES NOT SIMPLY MS PAINT INTO

KIDDING NICE JOB THANKS FOR SHARING
LOVE IT BUT IF THE ORANGE LINE IS FRODO SAM THEY WENT TO MORGANTON BEFORE PATH
THIS IS REALLY COOL I JUST HAVE ONE NITPICK QUESTION

WOULD IT BE MORE ACCURATE TO PORTRAY ROHAN THE SHIRE KIRKWOOD AS REGIONS LIKE YOU DID CONDOR AND ERIADOR ETC RATHER THAN CITIES LIKE YOU DID MINAS TIGRISH AND RIVENDELL
WHAT I

PASTE A MAP OF MIDDLE EARTH

HIT LIVE TRACE ON ILLUSTRATOR

OBLIGATORY QUESTION MARKS

PROFIT SUSPENSION FOR PLAGIARIZING
GONNA NEED THE NAME OF THAT THERE FONT
LOOKS GOOD MAN BUT I'D CHANGE THE FONT ON THE LOCATION LABELS THEY LOOK A BIT OUT OF PLACE
I DON'T SEE FANGORN
REALLY FRIENDLY LOOKING ILLUSTRATION GOOD JOB MAN
AWESOME
LOVELY
YOU USED PHOTOSHOP FOR IT IN MY GA CLASS WE USED ILLUSTRATOR FOR ANYTHING THAT WASN'T PHOTO EDITING
DID AFNOR AND ERIADOR CO-EXIST I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT ERIADOR BECAME AFNOR
VERY NICE THIS STYLE REMINDS ME OF THE MAPS IN THE OLD CHRONICLES OF PRYDAIN BOOKS ANY CHANCE YOU WERE INSPIRED BY THEM IT MIGHT JUST BE THE FONT CHOICE DOING THAT FOR ME
GO BACK TO CLASS

I LIKE THE LOOK REMINDS ME OF THE CYCLE OF PRYDAIN MAPS AND THAT'S A GOOD THING

ONE THING I NOTICED THE TRAVELS OF FRODO AND SAM NEED TO INCLUDE THEIR JOURNEY THROUGH THE ELYN MAIL ACROSS THE DAGORLAD PLAIN TO THE BLACK GATE AND THAT'S MISSING
DUDE YOU'RE IN A GRAPHIC ARTS CLASS AND YOUR SOLUTION FOR SHARING YOUR RESULTS IS A PHOTO OF THE SCREEN WITH YOUR CAMERA DO THEY NOT TEACH STUDENTS HOW TO USE SCREEN CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL AT GRAPHIC ARTS YOU MUST MASTER PRESENTATION
ALL OF NW ME IS ERIADOR AFNOR DID NOT EXIST AT THE TIME OF LOAR

OTHERWISE MPH
ITS BECAUSE THEY WERE PRETENDING TO BE INEBRIATED AND SLURRING THEIR SPEECH IF YOU WATCH THE SPECIAL FEATURES THEY DID SEVERAL TAKES RANGING FROM ENJOYING NICE TOBACCO TOTALLY SOBER TO VERY STONED
CUNT
HEY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
SPEAK TRICK OR TREAT AND THE DOOR WILL OPEN
THATS BLOODY GOOD
OUTSTANDING
MY FIRST TIME SEEING MADE ME AND MY GAL LAUGH THANKS FOR POSTING
GIMLI SON IS THE BEST

I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN AXE SO WIELDED

ARAGON SON OF ARATHORN CALLED ELESSAR THE ELFSTONE DÚNADAIN THE HEIR OF ISILDUR SON OF CONDOR
ON THE ALBUM THE RETURN OF THE COMPLETE RECORDINGS THIS CONTAINS SONGS YOU CAN FIND THE TRACK THE FELLOWSHIP REUNITED WHICH IS THE SAME TRACK AS RETURN OF THE KING IN THE SHORTER TRACK ALBUM THIS ALBUM YOU CAN FIND ON EG TIDAL BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ON PONTIFY
NO CLUE I NOTICED THAT THE LAST MARCH OF THE ANTS ISN'T ON THE TWO TOWERS SOUNDTRACK ON PONTIFY EITHER
OF COURSE I HAVE TO BE THAT GUY

THE QUOTE FROM THE FILM IS WRONG TWICE AS COMPARED TO THE BOOK THE ACTUAL QUOTE IS

YOU CANNOT PASS HE SAID THE ORCS STOOD STILL AND A DEAD SILENCE FELL I AM A SERVANT OF THE SECRET FIRE WIELDER OF THE FLAME OF ACOR YOU CANNOT PASSIVE THE DARK FIRE WILL NOT AVAIL YOU FLAME OF UNDEN GO BACK TO THE SHADOW YOU CANNOT PASSIVE

PERSONALLY I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION SHALL NOT MEANS GANDALF IS GOING TO STOP THE BARONG CANNOT MEANS THAT THE POWER OF MANAWA A ALAR IS BEING INVOKED AND THE BARONG LITERALLY CANNOT PASSIVE

SO FIRST HE DOESN'T SAY YOU SHALL NOT PASS AND SECOND IT'S THE FLAME OF ACOR NOT AFNOR

AFNOR ALSO KNOWN AS THE NORTHERN KINGDOM WAS A KINGDOM OF MEN LOCATED IN THE LAND OF ERIADOR IN MIDDLE-EARTH

ACOR IS THE ELVISH WORD FOR THE SUN SO LITERALLY THE FLAME OF ACOR WOULD BE THE LIGHT OF THE SUN WHICH ORIGINATED IN THE FIERY FRUIT OF LAURELING ONE OF THE TWO TREES OF ALIENOR THUS GANDALF MAY BE REFERRING TO THE POWER HE GAINS AS A SERVANT OF THE LORDS OF THE WEST IN DEFIANCE TO THE CORRUPTED DARKNESS OF THE BARONG

BUT ANYWAY THAT'S SOME REALLY COOL CALLIGRAPHY
BECAUSE OF THE FLOURISH HE PUT ON THE P ALL I SEE IS

YOU SHALL NOT BASS
DDK ABOUT LICENSED BUT THERE IS THE SHIRE COOKBOOK AS WELL AS MEDIUM-RARE AND BACK AGAIN STILL IN KICKSTARTER AND TWO OR THREE OTHER LOAR THEMED COOKBOOKS AND THOSE ARE JUST THE ONES THAT SHOWED UP ON THE FIRST PAGE OF GOOGLE
THEY ARE AVERSE TO WATER BUT IT IS SAID OF THEM

ALL EXCEPT THE WERE APT TO STRAY WHEN ALONE BY DAYLIGHT AND ALL AGAIN SAVE THE FEARED WATER AND WERE UNWILLING EXCEPT IN DIRE NEED TO ENTER IT OR TO CROSS STREAMS UNLESS DRY-SHOD BY A BRIDGE THE HUNT FOR THE RING

SO THEY WOULD ENTER IT OR CROSS IT WHEN THEY ABSOLUTELY HAD TO THE BRUCINE WAS LIKE A SUPER FLOOD THAT WASHED THEM AWAY IT WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAME EFFECT ON ANYONE ELSE AND PROBABLY HAVE KILLED THEM
DON'T HAVE A HANDY SOURCE BUT THE ULMO THE VALA IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH WATER THINK NEPTUNE ESPECIALLY THE OCEANS AND RIVERS ULMO WAS BASICALLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE ALAR THAT WOULD STILL LEAVE ALIENOR AND VISIT ME ALSO HE WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FOES OF MELIOR AND HIS MINIONS THE THOUGHT IS THAT WRINGWRAITHS AND OTHER EVIL BEINGS WERE AFRAID THAT ULMO COULD GET THEM IN RIVERS
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A REFERENCE TO FOLKLORE SINCE MANY TRADITIONS HOLD THAT GHOSTS VAMPIRES EVIL SPIRITS CAN'T CROSS RUNNING WATER DUE TO ITS PURIFYING PROPERTIES
IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE SCENE IN THE MOVIES WHERE THEY ARE CHASING FRODO THEN THE MOVIE EXPLANATION IS ARWEN SUMMONED THE RIVER AROUND RIVENDELL TO SWEEP THEM AWAY BASICALLY THE MAGIC NOT THE WATER DEALT WITH THEM
THEY HANDLE PLAIN OLD WATER JUST FINE I THINK THERE ARE EVEN MOVIE SCENES WITH THEM ON BRIDGES IN RAIN

THE RIVER AT THE EDGE OF TERRITORY IS MAGICALLY PROTECTED AND GOT A BOOST FROM GANDALF IN THE BOOKS
THAT'S AWESOME WHERE DID YOU FIND THE ARTWORK
I WOULD ALSO BE INTEREST IN A SOURCE
THIS IS SO COOL
LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
THAT'S CURRENTLY MY TEXTING APP WALLPAPER
NEED TO GET MINE FRAMED CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REST OF THE SERIES
MINE ARRIVED YESTERDAY HOPING TO GET IT SIGNED IN THE FUTURE
YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT FOR A DISCOUNT YEAH I'LL DEFINITELY WAIT HAHA THANKS FOR ALL THE INFO CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO COME IN THEN TO GO FRAME SHOPPING AT HOBBY LOBBY SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY EVER
THE NAGUAL ARE THE FELLOWSHIP I GUESS THAT THEY WERE A FELLOWSHIP AFTER ALL

LOOKS COOL GOOD SHOT
I WASNT AWARE THESE EXISTED BUT NOW THAT I DO GOD I WANT ONE THEY ARE AMAZING
HERE IS PETER HOLLERS COVER OF MOST OF THE HOBBIT DRINKING SONGS THEY ARE AVAILABLE ON ITUNES IF THAT'S YOUR THING
CHECK THE INDEX AFTER THE APPENDICES WHERE YOU'LL FIND A LIST OF THESE HERE ARE SOME OF THE SONGS POEMS I'VE COME ACROSS IN LOAR
MERRY AND PIPPIN SING ABOUT DRINKING IN THE GREEN DRAGON BUT IT HAPPENS IN THE TWO TOWERS DURING THE FEAST IN ROHAN
IF YOU PLAY THE LEGO LORD OF THE RINGS GAME THEY HAVE TOM AND THE BURROWS
I HAVE NOT YET ATTEMPTED AN EXTENDED HOBBIT LOAR MARATHON I'VE DONE AN EXTENDED LOAR MARATHON ONCE AND THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME LUCKILY MY BUDDY AND I ARE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN SOON MAYBE WE'LL THROW THE HOBBIT IN TOO HOW DID YOU FAIR HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH IT ALL
I MARATHON THE EXTENDED EDITIONS WHENEVER I GET A LONG BREAK FROM UNI I'VE WATCHED THE FILMS ENOUGH TIMES TO PROBABLY BE ABLE TO MEMORISE MOST LINES BUT THE FEELINGS STILL HIT ME EVERY TIME ONE OF THE GREATEST JOYS INDEED

I'LL ALWAYS BE A BIT SAD THAT THEY NEVER INCLUDED THE LAST DEBATE IN THE FILMS LOVED TO SEE THAT
THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT PETER JACKSON CONSIDERS THE THEATRICAL CUTS TO BE THE DEFINITIVE VERSIONS OF THE FILMS BUT HE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT MOST FANS PREFER THE EXTENDED EDITIONS
WHAT'S THIS SUBS OPINION OF THE HOBBIT EXTENDED EDITIONS I COULD BARELY STAND THE THEATRICAL RELEASES BUT HAVE ENJOYED SOME FAN EDITS ARE THEY ACTUALLY IMPROVED BY MAKING THEM LONGER
AS I TYPE THIS ON AT AM I AM 2 HOURS INTO ROK EE WATCHING THE LOAR EE TRILOGY IS TIRING ENOUGH BUT ADDING IN THE HOBBIT EE TRILOGY IS JUST TIRING IT'S BEEN AROUND HOURS OF STRAIGHT MOVIE IT HAS BEEN ONE HELL OF A RIDE THOUGH
I TRIED THE MARATHON OF ALL IN A ROW AND HAD TO STOP I GOT SHIT SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE AND STARTED AT AM AND I MADE IT UNTIL AROUND AND STILL HAD HALF OF THE 2ND ONE AND THE ROK SO THAT WASN'T HAPPENING I RECOMMEND STARTING EARLY BUT GET HOURS OF SLEEP AND FOOD PREPPED
I WAS PLANNING TO WATCH ALL SIX MOVIES DURING WINTER THAT'S A GOOD IN DOOR ACTIVITY
SOMEHOW THAT'S MORE TERRIFYING THAN ANYTHING IN THE BOOKS
ITUNES
I GOT MINE ON MY ABOX
TRY AMAZON OR SONY I SAW THEM ON THERE NOT TOO LONG AGO
PIRATE BAY
THESE ARE BOTH MOVIE QUESTIONS

SARON HAS A HUGELY DETAILED BACKSTORY DATING BACK TO LITERALLY BEFORE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD BRIEFLY HE IS ONE OF THE MAAR A DIVINE BEING OF AN ORDER ROUGHLY ANALOGOUS TO ANGELS AS ARE THE WIZARDS AND THE BARONG THE WORLD WAS BROUGHT INTO BEING WHEN THE MAAR AND THE ALAR GODS BASICALLY SANG A GREAT SONG AT THE COMMAND OF GOD MORGOTH THE MIGHTIEST OF THE ALAR TRIED TO CHANGE THE MUSIC TO HIS OWN ENDS WHICH BASICALLY TRANSLATES INTO FALLING TO EVIL A NUMBER OF THE MAAR FELL WITH HIM WHICH BECAME THE BARONGS SARON DIDN'T BUT AS THE WORLD WAS BEING CREATED HE WASN'T HAPPY WITH THE CHAOS OF IT AND SAW MORE HOPE OF FURTHERING HIS AGENDA UNDER TYRANNY THAN THE RULE OF THE REST OF THE ALAR SO HE SWITCHED SIDES AND BECAME CHIEF LIEUTENANT AND AFTER MORGOTH WAS DEFEATED BY THE ALAR HE STEPPED UP TO BECOME

THAT'S JUST THE BARE BONES OF THE BEGINNING OF HIS STORY IT'S MASSIVELY DETAILED

HE DID HAVE A BODY IN THE BOOKS AND HAD FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS PRIOR WHY DIDN'T HE FIGHT THEN CAUSE THE TRUTH IS SARON KINDA SUCKS IN A FIGHT HE ONLY CAME OUT TO FIGHT THE LAST ALLIANCE AFTER BEING UNDER SIEGE FOR YEARS AND HE WAS PRETTY MUCH OUT OF SOLDIERS PRETTY MUCH EVERY TIME HE'S EVER TRIED FIGHTING HE'S HAD HIS ASS HANDED TO HIM INCLUDING ONCE BY A DOG A REALLY KICKLESS DOG BUT STILL HE'S A SCHEMER AND A MASTER MANIPULATOR NOT A FIGHTER
THE SILMARILLION WILL EXPLAIN A LOT OF QUESTIONS THE LOAR SERIES AND THE HOBBIT MAY HAVE LEFT YOU WITH A LOT OF THE LITERATURE RELEASED BY TZOLKIN IS CITED ON THE WIKI FOR EASY CONSUMPTION DETAILING PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT PRETTY MUCH EVERY TOPIC ON MIDDLE EARTH MUCH OF IT DIRECTLY QUOTED FROM THE SILMARILLION IT CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS THE BIBLE OF MIDDLE EARTH TELLS YOU HOW THE WORLD CAME TO BE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE EARLY DAYS
SARON DOES HAVE A BODY AT THE TIME OF LOAR THEY DON'T SHOW THIS IN THE FILM SARON IS MORE IMPORTANT AS A LEADER AND THAN AS A COMBATANT

AT THE BATTLE OF THE LAST ALLIANCE HE ONLY COMES OUT AND FIGHTS ISILDUR AS A LAST RESORT
WHEN EXACTLY SARON APPEARS I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND IT
THERE IS A LOT OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON SARON VISIT TOLKIENGATEWAY FOR THAT DO NOT USE LOTRWIKI IT IS A SILLY PLACE

2 IN THE BOOKS HE HAS A BODY AGAIN HE DOESN'T FIGHT BECAUSE EACH TIME HE DID HE NEARLY DIED ALL OF THAT IS WRITTEN ON TOLKIENGATEWAY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYONE FOR THE HELP I WILL GO BUY A COPY OF THE SILMARILLION TODAY AND READ UP
THIS IS A COPY

I ALSO ORDERED LETTERS AND THE NEWLY PUBLISHED LEAF BY NIGGLE WHICH HAVE YET TO ARRIVE
READING THIS MUST BE SO DISAPPOINTING WHEN THE TALES ABRUPTLY STOP
ENJOY BESIDES RETURN OF THE KING THIS IS MY AV HOPE YOU FIND IT PLEASANT AS WELL
GOOD CHOICE YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO HELL IF YOU HAD BLOWN THE MONEY ON HARRY POTTER
I THINK THIS IS A CHRISSY TZOLKIN PUBLICATION
COMMENTING FOR LATER
WHAT DO YOU HAVE LEFT OF THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH
LET ME KNOW IF HC LOT 2 DOES NOT GET SOLD I AM INTERESTED
IS LOT PB STILL AVAILABLE
IN THE BOOK IT'S HIS OTHER BOOT
GOOD SPOT BUT TO ME IT LOOKS MORE LIKE HE EITHER DROPS SOMETHING OTHER THAN HIS BOOT OR SIMPLY KICKS A ROCK OVER
I CAN NEVER IGNORE THE PART WHERE SWORD FALLS OUT OF THE SCABBARD
WATCH V HEMLINE


HIS SHOES BOTH STAY ON HE DOES HIT A ROCK OR GRASSY KNOLL OR SOMETHING AT THAT TIME WHICH ROLLS OVER
IF HE ACTUALLY LOST HIS BOOT I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE MENTIONED IT IN THE BONUS FEATURES OF THE EXTENDED EDITION LIKE VIGO TALKING ABOUT KICKING THE ORC HEAD AND BREAKING HIS TOE
I'VE NEVER NOTICED THAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
THE POOR VIDEO QUALITY HERE MAKES IT LOOK LIKE IT COULD BE HIS SHOE BOOT BUT IT'S NOT IT'S SIMPLY PART OF THE LANDSCAPE THAT HE KICKS UP WHILE RUNNING I JUST CHECKED IT MYSELF FRAME BY FRAME
I NEVER NOTICED THAT SOMETHING ABOUT SEEMED OFF TOO MAYBE I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN THE RIGHT EXTENDED EDITIONS
IT'S A PORKERY NOW
THAT'S A ROCK
WE DWARVES ARE NATURAL SPRINTERS VERY DANGEROUS OVER SHORT DISTANCES
I GUESS HE WOULD HAVE STOPPED RUNNING IF HIS SHOE HAD FALLEN OFF AND THE WOULD HAVE RESHOT IT I DOUBT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PARTICULARLY HARD OR EXPENSIVE SHOT TO RESHOOT

THE EXTENDED EDITIONS ARE ALL ON NETFLIX IF ANYONE DIDN'T KNOW THIS SCENE HAPPENS AROUND THE MINUTE MARK OR SO CAN'T QUITE TELL ON MY LAPTOP

SEEMS TO ME LIKE HE LOST A PIECE OF SOMETHING BUT KEPT HIS BOOT THANKFULLY

NICE CATCH BRETT THE SCALE DOUBLE HURT HIMSELF QUITE A BIT DURING FILMING ATLEAST HE DIDN'T HAVE TO RUN WITH BARE FEET
KEEP BREATHING THAT'S THE KEY
DWARVES ARE SPRINTERS THEIR BOOTS START FLYING OFF AFTER ABOUT METERS
I'LL ADD IT TO THE LIST OF THINGS I'LL NEVER UNSEE IN THESE MOVIES ALONGSIDE THE FIRST NAGUAL MORPHING OUT OF THE TREE THE HOBBITS HIDE UNDER AND PIPPIN GETTING HIT IN THE HEAD WITH AN APPLE AND MAGICALLY HAVING IT TELEPORT TO HIS HAND
IT'S A KICKING A ROCK AH
ITS A ROCK
LOOKS MORE LIKE HE KICKED A ROCK OR CLUMP OF DIRT
I JUST CHECKED THE BLURRY FOR LOOKS MORE TO ME LIKE HE DROPS A PIECE OF HIS ARMOUR

THIS SHOT HAS ALWAYS BOTHERED ME AS IT'S ONE OF THE FEW WHERE THEY DIDN'T GET THE SIZES CORRECT GIMLI LOOKS THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHERS WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE JUST A BIT TALLER THAN A HOBBIT MOMENTS LATER THERE'S A CUT TO A SECOND AERIAL SHOT WHERE THE SIZE IS BACK TO NORMAL
NO WONDER HE'S ALWAYS BEHIND I JUST IMAGINE HIM LIMPING AROUND BEHIND THEM
THEY'RE NOT ENTIRELY NEUTRAL THEY JUST MAINLY KEEP TO THEMSELVES THEY INTERVENE SEVERAL TIMES IN THE LEGENDARIUM USUALLY JUST TO OFFER RIDES BUT OCCASIONALLY TO DO BATTLE THEY DON'T GET INVOLVED IN THE WARS OF MEN BUT AGAINST THE DARK LORD THEY WILL OFFER AID AS SEEN IN THE WAR OF WRATH WHERE THEY HELPED ÉARENDIL SLAY ANCALAGON AND THE WINGED DRAGONS

BASICALLY THE EAGLES ARE PEOPLE THEY HAVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD THAN ALMOST ALL OTHER MORTALS AND ANSWER ONLY TO THEIR OWN KING AND THE ALAR THIS IS WHY THEY HELP GANDALF SO MUCH HE WAS SENT TO REPRESENT THE ALAR IN MIDDLE EARTH

IT'S LIKELY THEY RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BATTLE AT THE BLACK GATE AND SOUGHT TO COUNTER THE AERIAL ADVANTAGE THE NAGUAL GAVE TO FORCES THEY MAY HAVE BEEN SENT OR SUMMONED BY GANDALF OR MANAWA BUT I SEE NO NEED TO ASSUME THAT
I SECOND THAT COMMENT THE EAGLES WERE CREATED BY FANWE AND SO REGARDLESS OF HOW OFTEN THEY ACT THEY ARE CLEARLY ON THE GOOD SIDE AS TO WHY THEY CAME PRESUMABLY THEY KNEW OR HEARD THAT A BATTLE WAS COMING AND THAT THEY WOULD BE NEEDED
GOOD QUESTION THEY HATED ORCS AND WE'RE FRIENDS BUT THE BOOK DOES NOT ACTUALLY SAY WHY THEY SHOWED UP

BECAUSE THE EAGLES ARE A DEUS EX MACHINA AND USED AS SUCH IN THE HOBBIT AND THE SILMARILLION AS WELL
NOT FROM THE MOVIES BUT FROM THE BOOK WHEN FRODO AND ARAGON ARE TALKING IN BREE DISCUSSING THE POEM ABOUT ARAGON AND THE BROKEN SWORD

DID THE VERSES APPLY TO YOU THEN ASKED FRODO I COULD NOT MAKE OUT
WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE IN LETTER
IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IT

I DID NOT KNOW HE ANSWERED BUT I AM ARAGON AND THOSE VERSES GO
WITH THAT NAME HE DREW OUT HIS SWORD AND THEY SAW THAT THE BLADE WAS INDEED
BROKEN A FOOT BELOW THE HILT NOT MUCH USE IS IT SAM SAID STRIDER BUT
THE TIME IS NEAR WHEN IT SHALL BE FORGED ANEW

SAM SAID NOTHING

SO IT WAS BROKEN A FOOT BELOW THE HILT

IN THE BOOK IT WAS BROKEN IN TWO PIECES IT SEEMS ARAGON TALKING TO BOOMIER AT THE COUNCIL OF ELROD

AND HERE IN THE HOUSE OF ELROD MORE SHALL BE MADE CLEAR TO YOU SAID
ARAGON STANDING UP HE CAST HIS SWORD UPON THE TABLE THAT STOOD BEFORE
ELROD AND THE BLADE WAS IN TWO PIECES HERE IS THE SWORD THAT WAS BROKEN
HE SAID
THAT'S THE PERFECT DUDE SERIOUSLY FACE
IT COMES IN PINTS
ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD JUST DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS LIKE HOBBITS AND I RECKON IT WOULD STILL WORK OUT PRETTY WELL
I NEVER KNEW HOW TO DESCRIBE MY LIFE NOW I DO
IS TOBACCO AND WAS INVENTED BY HOBBITS
WHERE CAN I BUY THIS
NO LIE I'M GOING TO SHAMELESSLY PLAGIARIZE THIS THANK YOU OP AND THANK YOU TO THE ARTIST WHOEVER YOU ARE THIS IS GOING ON MY FRONT DOOR
I REALLY LIKE THIS BUT IF I WERE TO BE HONEST I WOULD MOST LIKE TO DO AS THE HOBBITS DO WHEN IT COMES TO ALL OF THOSE THEY REALLY DO HAVE THE BEST LIFE OF ALL INHABITANTS OF MIDDLE EARTH IMO
A FIGHT BROKE OUT IN THE TOWER OF CRITH DUNGOL THE NEWS COMING FROM THAT TOWER WAS PROBABLY A LOT OF GIBBERISH BUT A FEW ELDEN TOKENS WERE SUCCESSFULLY SENT TO THE DARK TOWER THE MITHRAIC VEST AND THE ELDEN CLOAK OF FRODO BECAUSE OF THESE ITEMS SARON THOUGHT THE FREE PEOPLES SENT SPIES TO HIS LAND SAM TOOK THE RING FROM FRODO WHEN HE GOT STABBED BY SHELDON THINKING FRODO DIED AND HE HAD TO CONTENU ON HIS OWN THEREFORE SARON STILL THINKS THE FREE PEOPLES HAVE THE RING AND ARE PLANNING TO USE IT AGAINST HIM NOT DESTROY IT SARON DOESN'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT THE MISSION WAS OF THE OWNER S OF THE ITEMS SO HE PROBABLY INSTRUCTED THE MOUTH OF SARON TO TAUNT AND DIG UP SOME INFORMATION
SARON ONLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS REPORTED SO HE THOUGHT FRODO HAD BEEN CAPTURED AND KILLED SINCE THAT'S WHAT THE ORCS PROBABLY REPORTED INSTEAD OF ADMITTING HE ESCAPED FROM THEM

YES THEY THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE CONSIDERING THEY WERE SHOWN SOMETHING FRODO NORMALLY NEVER TAKEN OFF UNLESS SOMEBODY STRIPPED IT FROM HIS CORPSE
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE ATTACK ON MORDOR AND OF ARAGON USING THE PALANTIR OF ISENGARD TO SHOW HIMSELF TO SARON AND DEFY HIM IS TO MAKE SARON THINK THAT ARAGON HAS THE RING OTHERWISE HE WOULD NOT DARE TO ATTACK MORDOR WITH FEWER FIGHTERS THAN SARON HAS GANDALF AND ARAGON MAY KNOW THAT SARON DOES NOT YET HAVE THE RING BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE IN A LOT MORE TROUBLE THAN THEY ARE OR PERHAPS THEY JUST KNOW THAT THEIR ONLY HOPE IS THAT SARON DOES NOT YET HAVE THE RING SO THEY HAVE TO PLAY OUT THEIR STRATEGY

SO THE MAIN POINT IS THAT WHATEVER SARON THINKS ABOUT THE SPIES HE DOES NOT EVEN DREAM THAT THEY HAD THE RING OR THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DESTROY THE RING
JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THE ORC THAT GETS AWAY WITH STUFF DOES SO AT A TIME WHEN FRODO IS MORE OR LESS STILL IN CAPTIVITY DOESN'T HE
SARON DID LIKELY KNOW BUT HE ALSO DIDN'T CARE BECAUSE IN HIS MIND THE RING BEARER AND HEIR TO ISILDUR WAS AT HIS DOORSTEP WITH HIS MAIN ENEMY GANDALF IN MIDDLE EARTH BENT ON DEFEATING HIM IN COMBAT
TRY LOOKING THROUGH THE QUESTIONS ON THAT AMAZON PAGE AND IF IT HASN'T BEEN ASKED YOU CAN ASK THERE AND PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT IT WILL GET A NOTIFICATION AND SOMEBODY WILL ANSWER THAT WAY YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO GET AN ANSWER ABOUT THAT EXACT PRODUCT

BOT BEEP BEEP I'M ALL ABOUT TOP POSTS

THIS POST HAD UPVOTES AND GOT POSTED TO TWITTER AND SUBREDDIT R REDDIN

THE TWEET



ALL UPVOTES ARE ON AND R REDDIN

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL POSTS ON AND R REDDIN
MIND BLOWN
HOLY SHIT FRODO WAS IN A COMA FOR SEVEN MONTHS I NEVER REALIZED THAT UNTIL READING THIS NOW HOW LONG WAS SAM OUT FOR I WONDER
THIS IS ADVANCED SHITPOSTING
IT'S NEARLY DINNER TIME I'M BAVIN HOOPS
HOLY SHIT IT'S PACIFIC WTF I'M TOO STONED FOR THIS
DELETED
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
REALLY WELL DONE ONE THING I LOVE ABOUT LOAR IS THAT SO MANY CHARACTER'S ARE FLESHED OUT AND PROVIDE AN INTERESTING POV AS THE MAIN PROTAGONIST
WHELP TIME TO WATCH ALL THE MOVIES AGAIN
WE MAKE HOLES IN TEETH
DURBGU DURBGU THAT IS LORD OF THE RING LORD OF THE EARTH TO ME THIS SOUNDS MORE LIKE WHAT THE ORCS ARE CHANTING THAN OTHER ANSWERS POSTED HERE FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE ETYMOLOGY DURBGU LORD BLACK SPEECH CURB RULE CONFER DURBATULUK TO RULE THEM ALL GU AGENTIVAL PERSONALIZING ENDING OF THE RING BLACK SPEECH NAG RING SHU OF THE OF THE EARTH BLACK SPEECH DASH EARTH SHU OF THE SOURCE INFORMATION FOUND HERE VIA GOOGLE AND NOT VETTED FOR ACCURACY
IN THE MATERIAL THERE'S FOOTAGE OF HOW THEY DID THAT THEY RECORDED A WHOLE STADIUM FULL OF FOOTBALL FANS I DON'T THINK THEY EVER SAID WHAT THEY WERE HAVING THEM CHANT THOUGH KNOWING THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THEY PUT IN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING IN BLACK SPEECH
WORM-TONGUED SAID THERE WOULD BE PUNCH AND PIE
THEY ARE CHANTING NO LIFE IN COLDNESS IN DARKNESS HERE IN VOID ONLY DEATH IN BLACK SPEECH GU KIBUM AHI AURUM THE CHANT WAS PARTLY TRANSLATED AND PARTLY INVENTED BY A LINGUIST NAMED DAVID SALO AND PETER JACKSON RECORDED IT AT WELLINGTON REGIONAL STADIUM IN NEW ZEALAND WITH FANS CHANTING IT DURING SOME CRICKET MATCH
LAURELING AND TELPERION I'D LOVE MY KIDS TO HAVE A TEACHER LIKE YOU IF I HAVE ONE SOME DAY


I BELIEVE IM MISSING SOMETHING
IT'S THE BIG TREES THE DADDY LONG LONG LEGS EATS
YES I'D SAY DEFINEDLY GIVE IT ANOTHER GO THE STORY REALLY GETS MOVING AT THAT POINT

I'D WAGER THAT ANYONE WHO BELIEVES TZOLKIN IS RACIST BECAUSE ORCS ARE DARK ARE PROBABLY NOT VERY BRIGHT AND LOOKING TO SPIN SOME NARRATIVE THEY WANT TO BELIEVE RATHER THAN ACTUALLY READING THE PROVIDED TEXT
KEEP GOING

RE RACISM SEE THIS POST

R QUOTESPORN COMMENTS Z CRI
IF I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO READ SOMETHING I WOULD NOT READ IT UNLESS I HAD TO FOR SCHOOL

ORCS ARE ORCS NOT BLACK PEOPLE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO HAD THE INCLINATION TO EVEN CONNECT THE TWO ARE THE RACISTS WOULDN'T YOU SAY

SUPPOSE TZOLKIN WAS RACIST WHAT OF IT YOU CAN JUST NOT READ HIS BOOKS OR WHATEVER IT IS PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER A RACIST
THE BOOKS HAVE HUGE SWATHS THAT ARE PRETTY SLOW JUST PART OF THE WRITING
NO ARGUMENT THERE BUT LIKE I TRIED GETTING AT IF U PUT YOURSELF IN SAM OR POOR OLD FORDOES NON EXISTENT SHOES IT'S ALOT SCARIER AND FAST PACED IN MY OPINION BUT I DO HAVE AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION
YES DO IT IT IS WORTH READING EVERY PAGE EVEN THE ONES
NOT GONNA LIE I FOUND THE WHOLE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY KIND OF BORING BUT IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH THE READ
I AGREE THAT THE FOR CAN BE BORING AT TIMES BUT IT STARTS TO GET GOOD AT MORIA AND THEN BOOKS ARE SIMPLY AMAZING DEFINITELY GIVE IT ANOTHER GO
IT'S SLOW CAUSE THE DANGER IN THE BEGINNING ISN'T TOO SIGNIFICANT JUST SOME DUDES ON HORSES BUT FOR THREE FOOT TALL HALFLINGS WHO ARE USED TO DRINKING AND CHILLAN IT'S HORRORFIYNG AND PAGE SOUTH PRETTY SURE MOST PEOPLE FROM TOLKIENS TIME WERE RACIST
THE REASON IS BECAUSE YOU'RE PICTURING MOVIE PERGOLAS KILLING AN ENTIRE ARMY WHILE LOOKING BADASS WHEN YOU SHOULD BE PICTURING BOOK PERGOLAS WHO'S A GREAT WARRIOR BUT CAN'T TAKE A WHOLE GROUP OF URUK SINGLEHANDEDLY
ARAGON WAS BY FAR THE BETTER TRACKER OF THE GROUP HE IS THE ONE THAT FOLLOWED THEIR TRAIL AND IT'S BECAUSE ARAGON COULDN'T FOLLOW THE TRAIL AT NIGHT BECAUSE OF THE MACHINATIONS OF SAURURAN THAT THE HUNTERS HAD TO STOP AT NIGHT THE PACE OF THE HUNTERS WAS DICTATED BY THEIR ABILITY TO FOLLOW THE TRAIL MORESO THAN THEIR PHYSICAL ABILITY WITHOUT ARAGON PERGOLAS WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN SLOWER OR MAY HAVE EVEN LOST HE TRAIL ENTIRELY

ALSO PERGOLAS DESPITE BEING BALLER AS HELL COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN ON THE WHOLE COMPANY OF BY HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE JUST ENDED UP VERY VERY DEAD
YEA THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK IMO THAT'S A LOT OF ORCS AND EVEN BOOMIER FELL TO THEM HE WAS ONE OF THE GREAT CAPTAINS OF CONDOR ELVES DO GET TIRED EVEN IF HE TRIED TO RUN UP ON THEM AND SHOOT AT THEM AND HARASS THEIR REAR WHO'S TO SAY THERE ARE NO ORCS FASTER THAN HE IS WHO'D CATCH HIM THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BOWMEN AS WELL FINGOLFIN GOT TIRED IN HIS BATTLE WITH MORGOTH AT THE LAST THE KING GREW WEARY OF THE RUIN OF BELERIAND AND THE FALL OF FINGOLFIN
BECAUSE PERGOLAS EXHAUSTED HIS RIDICULOUS MAGIC ORC SLAYING ABILITIES AFTER BEING DRIVEN INTO A BLOOD RAGE OVER BEING FRIENDZONED BY A CUTE AND A TEENAGE DWARF
BECAUSE ONLY SUICIDES TAKE ON A HORDE ALONE
IN AGREEMENT WITH THE OTHERS HERE I DOUBT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE THEM ON HIS OWN ONE THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT THEY LIKELY DIDN'T WANT TO SEPARATE THE COMPANY ANY MORE THAN NECESSARY I MEAN IF YOUR QUESTION WHY DIDN'T THEY GET TO MERRY AND PIPPIN ASAP YOU MAY AS WELL ALSO ASK WHY THEY DIDN'T JUST LEAVE GIMLI BEHIND HE WAS THE SLOWEST ONE NO THEY NEEDED TO STAY TOGETHER WHICH THEY DO FOR THE REST OF THE NEXT TWO BOOKS
BRILLIANT
REALLY BADASS MAKING HER THE O G WOMAN WHO CAN DO ANYTHING
THIS IS SO CLEVER AND WELL-EXECUTED I LOVE IT
TECHNICALLY THIS DOES NOT PORTRAY ANDURIL BUT PORTRAYS GARSIL THE BROKEN BLADE THE BLADE WAS ONLY RENAMED ANDURIL AFTER ITS REFORGING NICE ARTWORK THOUGH
AWESOME
NICE MERGE OF THE SYMBOLS I LIKE IT
EXCELLENT
GOOD THING THAT CORRECTION DID NOT HAVE TO BE DONE ON THE ARM
WHERE ARE WE GOING
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD BILBO WAS HAVING A BIT OF A BREAKDOWN BECAUSE OF ALL THE TALK ABOUT DRAGONS AND AND NONE BUT GANDALF POSSIBLY EVER RETURNING COMBINED WITH THE OVERALL STRESS OF HAVING TO SUDDENLY PLAY HOST TO THIRTEEN STRANGE DWARVES THE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING PART WAS JUST HIS REACTION TO THE BRIGHT LIGHT GANDALF CONJURED

EDIT THAT'S FROM AN PERSPECTIVE FROM THIS WAS PROBABLY JUST PART OF HIS ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH CHARACTER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NOVEL AS GENTLE EVEN TIMID AND HOME-LOVING QUITE THE OPPOSITE OF THE SORT OF PERSON WHO GOES ON ADVENTURES AND FIGHTS DRAGONS AND WHATNOT

REMEMBER ALSO THAT THE HOBBIT IS MUCH MORE LIGHT-HEARTED IN TONE THAN LATER WORKS IF I RECALL CORRECTLY SHORTLY AFTER FIT THE READER IS REGALED WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE INVENTION OF GOLF SO YOU CAN JUST TAKE IT AS AN AMUSING SLIGHTLY DESCRIPTION OF BILBO FREAKING OUT OVER EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED THAT EVENING
ARAGORNS SWORD SEEMS SMALL TO ME IT SHOULD BE OVER INCHES IN LENGTH FROM POMMEL TO POINT ITS A HAND AND A HALF OR BASTARD SWORD ITS SHOULD BE LARGER THAN HADHAFANG THE ARWEN SWORD
NICE
HEY YOU JUST REMINDED ME THAT I HAVE LOAR REPLICA SWORDS IN MY HOUSE THAT SHE KEEPS ASKING ME TO DO SOMETHING WITH WOULD YOU WANT THEM I HAVE GLAMOURING GARSIL STING AND PERGOLAS DAGGERS
IT'S ALL SPECULATION MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT TZOLKIN HAD ORIGINALLY WROTE THAT GANDALF WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE WIZARDS WHO DID NOT FAIL HIS MISSION SARON FELL THE BLUE WIZARDS WERE SAID TO CREATE CULTS IN THE FAR EAST AND RADAGAST IGNORED THE FIGHT AGAINST THE ENEMY TO PURSUE THE STUDY OF BEASTS AND BIRDS

TZOLKIN LATER CHANGED HIS MIND ON THIS STATING THAT THE BLUE WIZARDS POTENTIALLY HELPED CREATE A RESISTANCE IN THE FAR EASTERN RADAGAST MAY HAVE FOCUSES ON FREEING AND PRESERVING THE ANIMALS AND PLANTS OF MIDDLE EARTH WHICH MAY HAVE NEEDED A SHEPARD IN THE SAME WAY AS GANDALF WAS TO THE FREE PEOPLE

THE LAST WE HEAR ABOUT RADAGAST IS THAT WHEN THE ELVES WENT TO SUMMON HIM TO THE COUNCIL OF ELROD HIS HOME WAS ABANDONED

SINCE GANDALF WAS HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD BY THE TIME HE LEFT MIDDLE EARTH I BELIEVE THAT THE WIZARDS WERE IMMORTAL AND TIMELESS ASSUMING RADAGAST WASN'T KILLED OR CAPTURED BY SARON THE REAL QUESTION BECOMES DID HE ACTUALLY SUCCEED OR FAIL HIS MISSION IF RADAGAST SUCCEEDED THEN ITS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT HE EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO THE WESTERN IF HE FAILED IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DENIED ACCESS TO THE WESTERN IN THAT SITUATION I BELIEVE RADAGAST WOULD STILL BE AROUND TO THIS DAY PROBABLY HIDING DEEP IN SOME FORGOTTEN WOODS WHERE HE CAN CONTINUE HIS STUDY OF BIRDS AND BEASTS AND NOT BE BOTHERED BY THE BOTHERSOME FREE PEOPLES I IMAGINE HIM LOSING SOME OF HIS HUMANITY OVER THE LONG AGES THE RESULT AND PUNISHMENT FOR THE NEGLECT OF HIS CHARGE
THE WIZARDS INSTAR ARE OF THE MAAR RACE ANALOGOUS TO ANGELS WHICH IS A SUBSET OF THE AINU A TERM WHICH ENCOMPASSES ALL OF THE DIVINE BEINGS FORMED BY THE CREATOR ERU ILÚVATAR SARON HIMSELF IS A MAIA AS ARE BARONGS

ALSO AMONG THE AINU ARE THE ALAR WHICH ARE BEINGS SOME OF THE MORE NOTABLE AMONG THEM ARE MANAWA ARDA ELREATH AND MELIOR MORGOTH MASTER IN PREVIOUS AGES THESE AND MORE ARE ALL COVERED EXTENSIVELY IN THE SILMARILLION

ALL OF THE AINU ARE IMMORTAL BEINGS HOWEVER THE BODIES THEY INHABIT CAN BE SLAIN SAURURAN IS IN FACT SLAIN BY WORM-TONGUED AT THE END OF THE TRILOGY AFTER BEING KILLED HIS SPIRIT RISES AND TRIES TO RETURN WESTWARD TO ALIENOR THE HOME OF THE AINU BUT THE ALAR WOULD NOT RECEIVE HIM AFTER HIS EVIL DEEDS AND SENT A POWERFUL WIND TO BLOW HIS SPIRIT AWAY PRESUMABLY HIS SPIRIT STILL WANDERS FORMLESS AND IMPOTENT I BELIEVE SARON HAS ALSO EARNED THIS FATE

SO NOW TO THE QUESTION OF RADAGAST A COUPLE THINGS MAY HAVE HAPPENED PERHAPS HE WAS RELEASED OR ESCAPED WHATEVER ENSNAREMENT HE HAD BEEN CAUGHT UP IN AND STILL RESIDES IN MIDDLE EARTH SEEING OVER THE BIRDS AND BEASTS AS HE USED TO PERHAPS HIS BODY WAS SLAIN AND HIS SPIRIT RETURNED BACK TO ALIENOR HOWEVER HE WOULD HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE WILL OF THE ALAR WHO MAY OR MAY NOT RECEIVE HIM AS HE HAD ESSENTIALLY ABANDONED THE MISSION THEY HAD CHARGED HIM WITH IT'S POSSIBLE THEY BANISHED HIM TOO FROM RETURNING BUT I'M GUESSING THEY'D BE CHILL ABOUT IT AND LET HIM BACK MAYBE WITH SOME REPRIMANDING

IF ANYONE WITH MORE KNOWLEDGE WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT ANYTHING HERE PLEASE DO
RIDING ON HIS SLEIGH OF RUSTABELL RABBITS OF COURSE
AT SOME POINT T WROTE THAT GANDALF HAD LIVED THE LIFESPAN OF MEN NO WORD ON WHAT HAPPENED TO RADAGAST BUT I HOPE HE IS STILL AROUND
I'M STILL DISGUSTED THAT P JACKSON TURNED RADAGAST INTO A CLOWN
SARON DOESN'T WANT TO DESTROY THE REALMS OF MEN AND ELVES AND DWARVES HE WANTS TO RULE THEM
THUS AS THE SECOND AGE DRAWS ON WE HAVE A GREAT KINGDOM AND EVIL THEOCRACY FOR SARON IS ALSO THE GOD OF HIS SLAVES GROWING UP IN MIDDLE-EARTH

LETTERS OF TZOLKIN LETTER TO MILTON WALDMAN

SO THEY NÚMENOREANS CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH SARON THE LIEUTENANT OF THE PRIME DARK LORD WHO HAD FALLEN BACK INTO EVIL AND WAS CLAIMING BOTH KINGSHIP AND GODSHIP OVER MEN OF MIDDLE-EARTH

LETTERS OF TZOLKIN LETTER TO ROBERT MURRAY SJ

THE ELDAR AND THE NÚMENÓREANS BELIEVED IN THE ONE THE TRUE GOD AND HELD WORSHIP OF ANY OTHER PERSON AN ABOMINATION SARON DESIRED TO BE A GOD-KING AND WAS HELD TO BE THIS BY HIS SERVANTS IF HE HAD BEEN VICTORIOUS HE WOULD HAVE DEMANDED DIVINE HONOUR FROM ALL RATIONAL CREATURES AND ABSOLUTE TEMPORAL POWER OVER THE WHOLE WORLD

WHEN HE FOUND HOW GREATLY HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS ADMIRED BY ALL OTHER RATIONAL CREATURES AND HOW EASY IT WAS TO INFLUENCE THEM HIS PRIDE BECAME BOUNDLESS BY THE END OF THE SECOND AGE HE ASSUMED THE POSITION OF REPRESENTATIVE BY THE END OF THE THIRD AGE THOUGH ACTUALLY MUCH WEAKER THAN BEFORE HE CLAIMED TO BE MORGOTH RETURNED

LETTERS OF TZOLKIN LETTER NOTES ON WEST H REVIEW OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS
ONE OF CONSISTENT THEMES IS ABOUT THE FUTILITY OF EVIL IN HIS WORLD BEING ARROGANT SELFISH GREEDY AND VIOLENT CAUSES YOU TO GO THROUGH A DEGENERATIVE PROCESS YOU MAY GAIN POWER AND DOMINION FOR A WHILE YOU MAY DO A LOT OF DAMAGE TO THE WORLD ALONG THE WAY BUT EVEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE WON YOU WIND UP WITH NOTHING THAT YOU WANTED

MELIOR SARON SAURURAN THEY ALL STARTED OUT AS CREATURES OF POWER MAJESTY AND WISDOM AND THEY ALL ENDED UP WRETCHED REMNANTS OF THEIR FORMER SELVES THEY WANTED TO CREATE NEW THINGS OF THEIR OWN OR BRING ORDER TO THE WORLD BUT BY CUTTING THEMSELVES OFF FROM ERU GOD AND CHOOSING TO SERVE ONLY THEIR OWN AMBITIONS THEY CONDEMNED THEMSELVES

SO YES THIS LATE IN HISTORY HE'S PRETTY MUCH SETTING HIMSELF UP TO BE NOTHING BUT KING OF A WASTELAND ONCE HE WASN'T LOST TO EVIL ONCE HE HAD MUCH GRANDER AMBITIONS BUT BY THE END OF THE THIRD AGE HE'S LOST SO MUCH GIVEN UP SO MUCH THAT HE CAN'T RECOVER
BECAUSE SARON WANTED TO DOMINATE THEM NOT DESTROY THEM THAT WAS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE CREATION OF THE DIFFERENT RINGS OF POWER HIS CORRUPTION WORKED ON THE MEN CREATING THE NAGUAL BUT FAILED WITH THE ELVES

WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE KNOWN MAP OF MIDDLE-EARTH SARON BEFORE HIS DEMISE PRETTY MUCH CONQUERED ALL OF THE EAST SOUTH AND NORTHEAST AND SINGBAND
NUMBER YOU'RE GOING MORE TO THE MORGOTH ROUTE WHERE HE WOULD DESTROY ALL OF HIS ENEMIES AND THEN HIS SERVANTS SARON WAS ALL GOOD WITH HAVING SERVANTS FROM VARIOUS RACES THE BLACK NÚMENÓREANS WERE IN HIS HAND AND MEN OF THE EAST AND SOUTH AS WELL

HE DID NOT OBJECT TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE WORLD SO LONG AS HE COULD DO WHAT HE LIKED WITH IT SARON UNLIKE MORGOTH WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT FOR THE NÚMENÓREANS TO EXIST AS HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND INDEED HE USED A GREAT MANY OF THEM THAT HE CORRUPTED TO HIS ALLEGIANCE NOTES ON MOTIVES IN THE SILMARILLION
I HEAR IT'S EVEN BETTER WITH A LIVE ORCHESTRA
MAYBE IN FOR THE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF FOR
I WILL THROW OUT THERE THAT SOME THEATERS DO RERUNS OF THE TRILOGY MUCH TO MY GEEKY GLEE
ARDA IS OUR EARTH SO TECHNICALLY ITS TIMELINE HASN'T ENDED HOWEVER TZOLKIN WROTE VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE FOURTH AGE AND BEYOND

TZOLKIN STARTED A SEQUEL CALLED THE NEW SHADOW SET DURING THE REIGN OF SON

THE NOTION CLUB PAPERS ARE ABOUT SOME RECORDS FROM THE BEING FOUND IN
NOT COUNTING THE ARDA IS EARTH PART OR THE UNFINISHED SEQUEL THE LAST DATE I BELIEVE WAS FOLIO A THE YEAR OF GREAT-GRANDSON HARDING OF THE HILL'S DEATH

THE LAST YEAR INVOLVING ANY LORD OF THE RINGS CHARACTER WAS FOLIO A THE YEAR OF DEATH
IT STARTS OFF BEFORE ARDA WAS MADE IN THE ENDLESS VOID WITH ERU OR GOD WITH THE AINU AROUND HIM THERE THEY MADE A GREAT MUSIC AND THAT MUSIC WAS THE CREATION OF E UNIVERSE AND WITHIN IT ARDA EARTH

READ THE SILMARILLION FOR THE ENTIRE TALE IT'S QUITE GOOD

EDIT I MAINLY READ THE TITLE AND INTERPRETED LEAVE OFF AS IN WHERE WHEN IT STARTED I'LL LEAVE THIS HERE FOR WHOEVER IS INTERESTED
THE TIMELINE ENDS WHEN THE LAST OF THE FELLOWSHIP LEAVES MIDDLE EARTH
DO THEY HAVE ONLINE STORE YOU CAN LINK
I'D SAY THAT YOU DIDN'T START SHOPPING EARLY BUT PRECISELY WHEN YOU MEANT TO
I'D LOVE THAT THERE IS ALWAYS GREAT THINGS TO FIND IN AFFLECKS
ORDERED THANKS OP
YOU BETTER GIVE THIS TO HIM EITHER EARLY OR LATE LOL
THE STYLE REMINDS ME OF A TRADITIONAL AMERICAN TATTOO IT'S GREAT
HOPING YOU ARE ACTUALLY MY BROTHER IN MANCHESTER AND YOU ARE TRYING TO HELP THE DISGUISE BY SAYING IT'S NOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY NEXT MONTH
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A PIECE OF STAINED GLASS AT FIRST IT'S PRETTY COOL STILL
IT FITS REALLY WELL BUT I PREFER THE ORIGINAL ONE
WATCH THIS SCENE AGAIN AND LOOK AT ALL THE IDIOTS BEHIND ARAGON AND THEOWMEN SWINGING AT NOTHING AS THEY GO DOWN THE CAUSEWAY NOW YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO UNSEE IT SPOILER
GANDALF DID INTERACT WITH THE RING IN THE SHADOW OF THE PAST SO BASICALLY NOTHING HANDLING THE RING CLAIMING THE RING
AS U MIKEOFTHEPALACE POINTS OUT GANDALF DOES HANDLE THE RING YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THE PICKING IT UP BUT THAT'S NOT THE IMPORTANT BIT HERE IT'S BEING GIVEN THE RING OWNERSHIP OR CUSTODY OF THE RING IS WHAT MATTERS
GANDALF DOES HANDLE THE RING LATER IN THE STORY VERY BRIEFLY AND THAT'S AT A POINT WHERE HE IS FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT IT'S THE ONE RING IN FACT IT'S JUST AT THE POINT WHERE HE'S ABOUT TO TEST IT ONCE AND FOR ALL

HE CLEARLY DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT JUST TOUCHING IT FOR A MOMENT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE TEXT TO ASSUME THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO HANDLE IT FOR VERY LONG CERTAINLY HE'S INCLINED FROM THE BEGINNING TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH IT
BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WOULD TURN HIM INTO A VERY POWERFUL MONSTER
HE WAS NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS INITIALLY BUT HE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
THE MATTER IS THAT WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF OUR MITHRANDIR PICKED UP THE RING AND DECLARES HIMSELF THE RULER OF MIDDLE-EARTH AN EPICAL MASTER BATTLE WITH THE ALAR AGAINST THE POWERFUL CREATIONS OF THE NEW DARK LORD
DELETED
THE RING WOULD NOTICE GANDALF AND THE RING MIGHT START TRYING TO USE GANDALF AND HE DOESN'T KNOW IF HE COULD RESIST OR EVEN WHAT IT WOULD DO
BORT OF THE RINGS
ASSUMING YOU MEAN LOAR YES THEY TAKE PLACE IN THE SAME UNIVERSE SO DOES THE HOBBIT

BUT THE HOBBIT ISN'T AS GOOD WATCH LOAR FIRST THEN READ THE HOBBIT BOOK PREFERABLY

YOU WON'T SEE MANY OF THE SAME CHARACTERS IN THE HOBBIT FILM BECAUSE IT TAKES PLACE MANY MANY YEARS EARLIER
THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING THE TWO TOWERS AND THE RETURN OF THE KING ARE BASICALLY ONE CONTINUOUS HOUR MOVIE RELEASED IN THREE PIECES

THE HOBBIT AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY THE HOBBIT THE DESOLATION OF SMUG AND THE HOBBIT THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES ARE THE SAME ONE GIANT MOVIE RELEASED IN THREE PARTS

THE HOBBIT TRILOGY IS A PREQUEL TO THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY BILBO THE PROTAGONIST OF THE HOBBIT IS AN OLD MAN AT THE START OF LOAR

YOU SHOULD WATCH THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY FIRST FOLLOWED BY THE HOBBIT TRILOGY
IT'S ALL ONE UNIVERSE

2 NO THERE'S NO WEIRD WAY TO WATCH FELLOWSHIP TWO TOWERS RETURN OF THE KING

THE HOBBIT IS A LOAR MOVIE IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE HOBBIT AS WELL THE ORDER WOULD BE AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY THE DESOLATION OF SMUG BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES
REGARDING 2 THE CORRECT WAY TO WATCH IT IS BORT BORT STAR TREK II WRATH OF KHAN BORT 2
THE LORD OF THE RING MOVIES CORRESPOND TO THE THREE LOAR BOOKS ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT QUITE THE SAME THE BOOKS LIKE THE MOVIES BEGIN WITH FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING AND END WITH RETURN OF THE KING THE HOBBIT IS NOT LOAR THEY DO HAVE A CONNECTION BUT ARE ALMOST SEPARATE WORKS THAT HAVE CONNECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE RING BILBO FINDS IN THE HOBBIT IS MAGIC BUT IT'S NOT AS DANGEROUS AS REVEALED IN LOAR LIKE THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE LOAR BOOKS AND THE LOAR MOVIES THE HOBBIT CORRESPONDS TO THE THREE MOVIES IT WAS BROKEN UP INTO
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTIONS BUT I'D JUST LIKE TO MENTION THE MOST POPULAR WEIRD WAY TO WATCH STAR WARS IS 2 MANY JUST IGNORE
YES HOBBIT JUST HAPPENS ABOUT YEARS EARLIER THAN THE LOAR

2 I WOULD WATCH THE HOBBIT MOVIES FIRST AND THEN THE LOAR MOVIES LOAR WERE TENFOLD BETTER THAN THE HOBBIT MOVIES

YOU MIGHT SEE SOME CHARACTERS THAT ARE BOTH IN THE HOBBIT LOAR LIKE BILBO GOLLUM GANDALF AND A FEW OTHERS

BEST ADVICE READ THE BOOKS AS WELL HOBBIT FIRST THEN LOAR BOOKS IT WILL KINDA RUIN THE MOVIES SINCE THE BOOKS ARE HEALY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIES
THE CORRECT WAY TO WACH STAR WARS IS
NEW HOPE
EMPIRE
JEDI
AWAKENS

AND FORGET ANYTHING ABOUT ANY OTHER FILMS
EITHER YOU'RE TROLLING OR YOU DON'T HAVE THE INTELLECTUAL CAPABILITY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE THAT TZOLKIN HAS CREATED
THE DIALS ON THE TOP ARE THE DWARF ALPHABET AND HOLD THE KEY TO SLIDING THE LID OFFICIAL BUT THE MORIA GATE IS ALSO A PART OF THE PUZZLE

ADDITIONAL IMAGE 2 HETP
DOES IT SUMMON CENOBITES

SORRY WATCHED HELLRAISER AND HELLRAISER II YESTERDAY
THEY ARE THE GREATEST HORSEMEN OF MIDDLE EARTH

FOLK BROKE THE BALCHOTH AT THE BATTLE OF THE FIELD OF CELEBRANT AND SAVED CONDOR AND EARNED THE LANDS THAT WOULD BECOME ROHAN

DURING THE SIEGE OF DEEP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RIDICULOUS TO USE CAVALRY HOST WAS TOO SMALL TO MEET FORCES IN THE FIELD AND SO RETREATED TO THE HOLDFAST OF THE HORNBURG YOU WOULD ALWAYS WANT TO STAY WITHIN THE WALLS TO PRESERVE YOUR ADVANTAGE SO NO CAVALRY USE UNTIL THE FORCES OF SAURURAN HAD VERY NEARLY TAKEN THE FORTRESS

FORCE HAD BEEN ROUTED FROM THE FORDS OF EISEN AND PROBABLY LOST MOST OF THEIR HORSES IN ADDITION TO THIS DEEP IS A VALLEY THAT LIMITS THE ABILITY OF CAVALRY TO MANEUVER WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT DEATH AGAINST THE PIKEMEN OF ARMY

IN THE BATTLE OF PELENNOR FIELDS THE HOST OF THE ROHIRRIM BROKE THE SIEGE DESPITE BEING INCREDIBLY OUTNUMBERED BY MORE THAN FIVE TIMES THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND THE GROUP OF CAVALRY THEY FACED WAS THAT OF THE HARADRIM FROM THE SOUTH WHO THRICE OUTNUMBERED THE ROHIRRIM DESPITE ALL THIS THEOWMEN SLEW THE CHIEFTAIN OF THE HARADRIM AND THREW DOWN THEIR BANNERS

BY ALL OF THIS THE ROHIRRIM ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT THE GREATEST HORSEMEN IN MIDDLE-EARTH

EDIT A WORD
WELL HORSE ARE ESSENTIALLY EVERY PART OF THE LIFE HOWEVER THEIR STYLE OF FIGHTING WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE EASTERLING IT SHOULD BE NOTED HOWEVER THAT EASTERLING IS A GENERIC TITLE AND THAT THERE ARE SUB GROUPS OF THEM SUCH AS THE AND THE BALCHOTH WHO DO BOTH END UP ON THE LOSING SIDES OF THE WARS THEY FOUGHT
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ENOUGH TEXT TO SUPPORT THIS BUT I QUITE LIKE THE POSTULATION THAT KNIGHTS OF DOL AGOROTH SWAN KNIGHTS MAY HAVE BEEN THE MOST CAVALRY POWERFUL DURING THE WAR OF THE RING UNLIKE ROHAN WHO HAD TO TRADE CONDOR FOR ITS MILITARY GOODS I IMAGINE DOL AGOROTH HAD THE MEANS TO PRODUCE TRULY HEAVY CAVALRY THE SWAN KNIGHTS ACCOMPANYING ARAGON ULTIMATELY DECIDED THE BATTLE AT THE END ACCORDING TO THE BOOKS WHILE THEY ARE NOT PORTRAYED IN THE ACTUAL MOVIES
THE WORD STEM ROH ROCH MEANS HORSE IN ELVISH SO THE PEOPLE OF CONDOR WHO OFTEN NAME THINGS IN ELVISH CALLED THEM ROHAN ROHIRRIM THEY CALL THEIR OWN COUNTRY THE RIDDERMARK MARCH AND THEMSELVES EORLINGAS PEOPLE OF CEORL THE KING WHO LED THEM FROM THE NORTH TO ROHAN THEY ARE MORE OR LESS MODELED ON THE AND THEIR NAMES AND LANGUAGE ARE ANGLO-SAXON THE REAL WORLD SAXONS OFTEN HAD A HORSE AS A SYMBOL AND STILL DO TODAY THE SAXON STEED IT IS STILL USED IN THE HERALDRY OF PLACES WHERE CONTINENTAL SAXONS LIVE THE GERMAN WIKIPEDIA PAGE HAS MORE PICTURES

NOW THEY ALSO FIGHT ON FOOT A FEW TIMES IN THE MOVIES COMER IS THE RELIEF FORCE AT DEEP BUT IN THE BOOK COMER IS ALREADY AT DEEP AND THE ALLIES GANDALF BRINGS ARE ERKENBRAND AND MEN ON FOOT FROM THE WESTFIELD ALSO LATER WHEN THRODDEN HAS DIED ON THE FIELDS OF CONDOR AND COMER IS THE NEW KING HE SAYS THIS AFTER HE SEES SHIPS WITH BLACK SAILS APPROACH

STERN NOW WAS MOOD AND HIS MIND CLEAR AGAIN HE LET BLOW THE
HORNS TO RALLY ALL MEN TO HIS BANNER THAT COULD COME THITHER FOR HE THOUGHT
TO MAKE A GREAT AT THE LAST AND STAND AND FIGHT THERE ON FOOT
TILL ALL FELL AND DO DEEDS OF SONG ON THE FIELDS OF PELENNOR THOUGH NO MAN
SHOULD BE LEFT IN THE WEST TO REMEMBER THE LAST KING OF THE MARK SO HE RODE
TO A GREEN HILLOCK AND THERE SET HIS BANNER AND THE WHITE HORSE RAN RIPPLING
IN THE WIND

SO THEY ALSO FIGHT ON FOOT WITH BUT RIGHT AFTER THIS HE SEES IT IS ARAGON AND HIS ALLIES THAT ARRIVE ON THOSE SHIPS IN THE BOOK THEY ARE NOT THE GHOSTS BUT PEOPLE FROM OTHER PARTS OF CONDOR
IT'S NOT PRACTICE TO USE HORSES WHILE MOVING AROUND ON THE BATTLEMENTS

IT MAKES YOU TALLER AND EASIER TO HIT

2 THERE IS NOT THAT ENOUGH SPACE ON THE WALLS FOR THEM TO BE USING HORSES

JUST IMPRACTICAL TO USE HORSES WHILE DEFENDING HELMS DEEP

THEY WON'T RISE OUT AND MEET THEM BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF THEM
DELETED
WHERE DID U GET IT
NICE
I THINK THEY'RE FANTASTIC AND I ENJOY THEM A LOT BUT THEY'RE DEFINITELY NOT PERFECT
I'M THE OPPOSITE THEY'RE MY FAVORITES DESPITE KNOWING MANY OF THEIR FLAWS
MAYBE NOT PERFECT FILMS BUT I'D GO AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT THEY'RE THE BEST ADAPTATIONS EVER MADE THE BOOKS ARE SOME ODD YEARS OLD AND THE PROSE AND PACING ARE DEFINITELY HARD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO PUSH THROUGH THE MOVIES TOOK THE BOOKS AND TURNED THEM INTO HOURS OF CONSISTENT ENTERTAINMENT THE MUSIC THE ACTORS THE SETS THE CINEMATOGRAPHY ARE ALL INCREDIBLY WELL DONE AND TAKE THE BOOKS INTO A NEW MEDIUM BETTER THAN ANY OTHER ATTEMPT
I THINK THEY'RE MORE OF LESS A PERFECT MOVIE REPRESENTATION OF THE BOOKS
I LIKE THEM
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE OR FAVORITES
SEE THEY ARENT MY FAVORITES BUT THATS BECAUSE IM BURNED OUT FROM THE CHILDHOOD YEARS OF ME BEING OBSESSED WITH THEM AND FULLY BELIEVING THEY ARE PERFECT MOVIES
IF THEY WERE PERFECT MOVIES WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE
ORANGE CATS FTW
THAT CAT LOOKS FAMILIAR
TEVILDO PRINCE OF CATS
DEFINITION OF WHITEPOST
ITS JUST AN INTRODUCTION FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER HEARD OF LOAR BEFORE WATCHING THE FILM

THE FACT THAT ITS GALADRIEL SAYING IT IS PRETTY MEANINGLESS I DOUBT MUCH THOUGHT WAS PUT INTO IT FROM A PERSONALITY PERSPECTIVE


THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE THE WISEST AND FAIREST OF ALL THE CHILDREN OF ILUVATAR OTHER RACES INCLUDING THE AINU CONSISTENTLY DESCRIBE THEM AS SUCH THE ONE THING THEY DIDN'T HAVE IS FREEDOM FROM THE CIRCLES OF THE WORLD THEIR LIFE IS BOUND TO THAT OF THE EARTH FOR AS LONG AS IT REMAINS HUMANS ON THE OTHER HAND RECEIVED THE GIFT OF MORTALITY WHICH GIVES THEM FATE BEYOND THAT OF THE EARTH UPON THEIR DEATH AND REJOIN ILUVATAR IN HIS HALLS OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSE THIS IS WHY EVEN THE WISEST AND FAIREST OF ALL THE CHILDREN OF ILUVATAR ENVY THE GIFT GIVEN TO HUMANITY
TO BE FAIR SHE DOESN'T SAY THAT IN THE BOOK IN FACT SHE LIVED THROUGH THE FIRST AND SECOND AGES AND THE ELVES DID A BUNCH OF REALLY STUPID AND PERHAPS EVIL THINGS BACK THEN

THAT LINE WAS SAID IN THE MOVIE TO SHOW THAT THE ELVES WERE NOT CORRUPTED WHILE MEN WERE AND THE DWARVES SORT OF RESISTED CORRUPTION BUT THEY USED IT TO GET WEALTHY NOW THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT SARON DID NOT CREATE THE THREE AND NEVER TOUCHED THEM BUT SARON TOOK PART IN CREATING ALL THE OTHER RINGS SO THE SIXTEEN NINE AND SEVEN ARE PROBABLY MORE CORRUPTIVE BECAUSE THAT WAS PURPOSE AND NOT JUST BECAUSE MEN ARE WEAK IT SEEMS MEN ARE GENERALLY MORE EASILY CORRUPTED BUT IT'S NOT A HARD RULE GALADRIEL ADMITS SHE LONG DESIRED THE ONE RING BUT FARAMIR SAYS HE FEELS NO DESIRE FOR IT FAIRLY UNIQUE ARAGON ALSO RESISTS THE RING HE COULD HAVE TAKEN IT FROM FRODO IN BREE OR IN THE WILD
YES BUT TO BE HONEST THAT FITS WITH HER CHARACTER AND WITH MANY OF THE RACE OF ELVES
A BIT FULL OF HERSELF NO

PRETTY ACCURATE DESCRIPTION FOR MOST ELVES I'D SAY

HOWEVER IT ISN'T REALLY A HUGE STRETCH ELVES BEAUTY STANDARDS ARE DETERMINED BY HOW SLENDER ONE IS HOW FAIR THEIR HAIR AND HOW SMOOTH THEIR SKIN NONE OF THE OTHER RACES COME EVEN CLOSE TO THEM IN THOSE REGARDS

ALSO THEIR IMMORTALITY THING PROBABLY HELPED A LOT WITH BEING THE WISEST IN ALL HONESTY THE AVERAGE ELF PROBABLY WAS A FAIR BIT SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE HUMAN OR DWARF AND CERTAINLY DIDN'T LACK THE ARROGANCE TO SAY SO
WICKED TRICKSY FALSE
SHOULD GOLLUM REALLY BE CONSIDERED A SERVANT OF SARON

WHILE HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHEREABOUTS AND HIS DESIRE TO RECLAIM IT AIDED SARON ALTHOUGH ALSO CAUSED HIS DOWNFALL GOLLUM WAS ONLY EVER IN IT FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL GAIN

HE CARED NOT ABOUT THE HIGH POWERS OF ABOVE WHO TORTURED HIM TO OBTAIN KNOWLEDGE HE CARED ONLY ABOUT RECLAIMING HIS PRECIOUS AND PREVENTING ITS DESTRUCTION BY THE END OF THE BOOK HE IN NO WAY SERVED SARON EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY
IN IT FOR THE NOT FOR THE ACCURACY OR SURE LOOKS LIKE IT ANYWAY HARD TO SEE HOW A MISTAKE THAT OBVIOUS COULD BE MADE
I COULD BE WRONG BUT WASN'T THE ORIGINAL FILM DESIGN FOR THE WITCH KING VERY SIMILAR TO SARON I THINK I HEARD THEY HAD TO REDO IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO GET CONFUSED NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE JUST A FUN TIDBIT

EDIT THE ORIGINAL DESIGN IS ACTUALLY IN THE RETURN OF THE KING VIDEO GAME IT IS VERY

EDIT 2 SOUNDS REALLY LOUD APPARENTLY SORRY

T
HAS IT BEEN DELETED I COULDN'T FIND IT
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE WITCH OUTFIT WAS COOLER ANYWAYS
I THOUGHT THE WITCH KING WAS JUST ONE OF THE COMMANDERS OF BAUDRONS ARMY KINDA LIKE IMLERITH FROM THE WITCHER WHO WAS NUMBER ONE GUY
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN OFFICIAL PAGE
BUT CAN THEY SEE WHY KIDS LOVE THE TASTE OF CINNAMON BEMBAS CRUNCH
FUCKING CASUALS
THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT
TRIGGERED
I THINK THEY'VE SINCE DELETED THIS NOW XD
FORGIVE ME BUT THE MISTAKE IS NOT JUMPING OUT AT ME
WHEN YOU EVEN FOLLOW THE MOVIES
CRYPTIC
TELL ME WHERE IS THE LOAR FB PAGE ADMIN FOR I MUCH DESIRE TO SPEAK WITH THEM
YOU SIR GAVE ME A GOOD CHUCKLE
HI

I DID THE ORCHESTRATION MYSELF AND WHILE IT'S FAR FROM PERFECT I'M QUITE PROUD OF IT
EARLIER THIS YEAR I DID A COVER OF INTO THE WEST

I LOVE SINGING THESE SONGS AS IT TAKES ME BACK TO THAT MAGICAL TIME WHERE LOAR MOVIES WERE STILL COMING OUT

I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT
I'D SAY DO A AND LISTEN TO THIS PODCAST COLLEGE COURSE ON TZOLKIN IT REALLY HELPED ME FIND MY FEET WITH THE SILMARILLION AND THE SECTIONS ON THE HOBBIT LOAR AND OTHER WORKS ARE GREAT TOO

LECTURES COURSES

SO READ THE PAGES RECOMMENDED FOR EACH SESSION THEN LISTEN TO THE PODCAST THE STUFF ON LEAF BY NIGGLE AND IDEAS ABOUT FANTASY IN GENERAL CAN BE OPTIONAL BUT ARE ALSO PRETTY GREAT
ALSO BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN I THINK IT NOT EVEN POSSIBLE TO REMEMBER EVERY DETAIL EVEN WITH A SUPERHUMAN MEMORY IS DEFINITELY THE WAY TO GO THE STORIES SOMETIMES FORESHADOW FUTURE EVENTS THAT THE READER SIMPLY WON'T GET ON A FIRST READ FOR EXAMPLE TOM BOBADIL BASICALLY MENTIONS THE DÚNEDAIN BEFORE THE HOBBITS AND THE READER HAVE MET ARAGON

THE READER ALSO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ELROD OR GANDALF ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY REFER TO HISTORY THE SILMARILLION AND LOAR APPENDICES STUFF THEY ARE REALLY BOOKS YOU GET MORE OUT OF BY READING THEM MULTIPLE TIMES
I USED TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM WHEN I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE WHAT I EVENTUALLY FOUND HELPED A LOT WAS TO READ A BIT MORE SLOWLY AND TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO VISUALIZE WHAT YOU ARE READING IN OTHER WORDS YOU ALMOST HAVE TO NEVER MIND THE WORDS SO TO SPEAK BUT TO JUST RELAX AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND LET THEM DO THEIR JOB OF PUTTING PICTURES IN YOUR MIND
WATCH IT BY MYSELF
WHY JUST LATELY ON THESE BOARDS WITH ALL YOU FINE FOLKS OF COURSE
SOME OF THE INSIGHTS AND DISCUSSIONS I'VE SEEN HERE HAVE BEEN PRETTY EYE-OPENING AND A FEW EVEN ASTOUNDING POINTING OUT THINGS TO ME I NEVER STUMBLED UPON ON MY OWN THERE ARE SOME TALENTED SCHOLARS HERE WHETHER THEY HAVE ACTUAL DEGREES OR NOT WHO ARE WELL WORTH PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO

EDIT AS FOR THE FILMS MY MIDDLE SON ENJOYS A WATCH WITH ME EVERY NOW AND THEN BUT THE REST OF MY TRIBE ARE WELL PRETTY MUCH TROLLS I GUESS YOU'D SAY PUT IT ON AND THEY TURN TO STONE
MAKE FRIENDS ONLINE AND MARATHON OVER SKYPE IS THE NEXT BEST THING
I READ THE BOOKS UP AT MY CABIN IN THE MOUNTAINS COMPLETELY ALONE AND JUST SITTING IN A HAMMOCK IN THE SILENCE
MAKE MY GIRLFRIEND WATCH IT
I HAVE TWO FRIENDS AT HOME WITH WHOM I AM IN A PRIVATE FACEBOOK GROUP WE MARATHON THE FILMS EACH JANUARY 1ST WHICH IS WHAT GETS ME THROUGH THE YEAR OTHER THAN THAT ONLINE COMMUNITIES ARE A GREAT WAY TO DISCUSS THE WORKS OF JOHNNY TENSE I HAVE A FEW FRIENDS HERE WHO LIKE THE STORY BUT THEY KEEP TELLING ME THAT I GET TOO INTO IT WHENEVER I TALK ABOUT THE LEGENDARIUM
I CONSTANTLY MAKE INSIDE JOKES AND REFERENCES TO MYSELF I MET THIS KID AT MY SCHOOL WHO HAD THE DIMRILL GATE ON HIS SHIRT AND SO I ASKED HIM IF HE KNEW THE NAME OF THE ELF WHO DESIGNED IT
HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE A SPOKE CHINESE

I ANNOY MY FAN FRIENDS WITH MY CONSTANT RANTS ABOUT HOW GOOD IT IS
I WATCH IT WITH MY DEAD CAT
I JUST WATCH WITH MY DAD OR SISTER
I JUST DO
I TRY NOT TO LET IT DEFINE ME AND DO OTHER THINGS WITH MY FRIENDS
MY KIDS WENT OFF TO COLLEGE AND STOLE ALL THE BOOKS AND MOVIES
FOREVER ALONE
THE KIDS ARE BOTH IN COLLEGE AND DOING REALLY GREAT SO I CAN'T PLAIN THEY BASICALLY DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SCARE THE HELL OF ME THOUGH CAVE EXPLORATION OFF THE GRID IN THE AMAZON
APPROVED BUT DO NOT POST ANY LINKS TO THE COMPLETE EDIT PLEASE SEE THE RULES ON THE SIDEBAR REGARDING WORKS THAT INFRINGE COPYRIGHT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE PM THE MODS
HI THERE I'M FLATTERED THAT YOU CONSIDER MY FAN EDIT THE MAPLE FILMS CUT AND TWO OTHER EDITS TO BE AN INFLUENCE ON YOUR OWN PROJECT I DO HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT YOUR OWN EDIT BASED ON THE CLIPS YOU'VE UPLOADED SO FAR THOUGH PLEASE DON'T TAKE OFFENSE TO MY COMMENTS BUT I BELIEVE IN HONEST AND DIRECT FEEDBACK

FIRST OFF WHAT IS THE GOAL OF YOUR VERSION YOU SAY YOU'VE MADE THE BEST HOBBIT EDIT BY COMBINING IDEAS FROM THREE EDITS INTO YOUR OWN BUT ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE A PURIST VERSION OR ONE THAT FITS CLOSER WITH THE LOAR FILMS YOUR SITE SAYS YOU'RE MAKING IT SIMPLE FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK AND WHICH COULD STAND ALONE AS A MOVIE BUT THE WAY YOU'VE ARRANGED CERTAIN SCENES ALREADY BASED ON YOUR CULTIST AND THE YOUTUBE CLIPS KIND OF GOES AGAINST THAT GOAL

YOU CRITICIZED MY EDIT AND FOR HAVING A LOT OF AUDIO MISTAKES BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL TRANSITION FADE LEVEL ISSUES IN YOUR CLIPS ALONE NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN BUT THE AUDIO CUTS IN MY EDIT WERE ABOUT AS PRECISE AS I COULD GET THEM TO BE WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE ORIGINAL STEM FILES

YOUR OPENING PROLOGUE FEATURES FRODO WHO WASN'T IN THE BOOK EVEN SO YOU DON'T COMMIT TO KEEPING HIM ON SCREEN FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS HE ISN'T ACKNOWLEDGED BY BILBO NOR DOES HE HAVE ANY DIALOGUE AND THIS COMES OFF AS AWKWARD PLUS THE TRANSITION FROM OLD BILBO TO YOUNG BILBO IS WEIRD AND WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE MUSIC WHEN THE ORIGINAL SCORE WAS FINE

THE DINNER SCENES IN BAG END YOU CUT GANDALF YELLING AT THE DWARVES BUT WE STILL SEE SOME OF HIS MAGIC SHADOW ON THE WALLS PLUS THE REACTION SHOT OF BILBO IS ONE OF FEAR BUT IT NO LONGER MAKES SENSE IF GANDALF IS MERELY STANDING UP THE AUDIO CUT OF THE CHAIR FALLING IS NOTICEABLY DISTRACTING TOO

YOU CUT BLUNT THE KNIVES BUT YOU DIDN'T REMOVE IT ENTIRELY NOT SURE WHY YOU COULDN'T JUST LET THE SONG PLAY OUT AN EXTRA SECONDS ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WAS IN THE BOOK OR JUST REMOVE IT COMPLETELY YOU'RE TRYING TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND IT DOESN'T WORK

WE ALL KNOW HOW TOUGH THE TRANSITION IS HOWEVER I WOULDN'T CALL YOURS THE BEST AND OF AS YOU CLAIM THE CUT FROM BILBO SAYING I BELIEVE THE WORST IS BEHIND US TO THEM RUNNING FROM BEHORN MAKES LITTLE SENSE IF YOU'RE SHOWING THEM ON TOP OF THE CAPROCK THE AUDIENCE EXPECTS TO SEE HOW THEY GET DOWN FROM IT THE PACING GOES FROM A CALM SCENE OF RESOLUTION TO DROPPING US IN THE MIDDLE OF A CHASE IT MAKES NO SENSE THE THEATRICAL VERSION IS EVEN MORE CONFUSING WHERE DID THEY GET THOSE PONIES

I COULD LIST A BUNCH OF OTHER ISSUES I'M SEEING SO FAR THE ACTUAL BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES JUST WON'T WORK AS A FLASHBACK AND FOR YOU TO GO AND SAY THINGS LIKE THIS IS THE FANEDIT TO END ALL FANEDITS IS A LITTLE PREMATURE AND FULL OF HYPERBOLE YOUR CLIPS AND CULTISTS ARE LEADING TO AWKWARD PLOT HOLES CONTINUITY ERRORS AND NO SENSE OF CINEMATIC PACING INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE A PATCHWORK FROM OTHER EDITS I'D SUGGEST YOU FIND YOUR OWN NARRATIVE PATH BY STARTING FROM THE ORIGINAL FILMS ULTIMATELY THIS LOOKS LIKE A MESSY FRANKENSTEIN ASSEMBLY OF THREE FANEDITS AND THE ACTUAL STUDIO RELEASE S




PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE SONGS

OTHER THAN THAT IT SOUNDS COOL ALTHOUGH BRINGING IT IN LINE WITH THE LOAR TONE IS ONE OF THE CHOICES I DISLIKE
PERGOLAS WASN'T EVEN TIRED ARAGON AND GIMLI POWERED THROUGH IT


NONE OF THESE CHARACTERS ARE LIKE REGULAR MEN ARAGON IS OF THE HOUSE OF ELENDIL HARDY IS THE RACE OF ELENDIL THE RIDERS OF ROHAN HE AND HIS PEOPLE THE SOLDIERS OF THE DÚNEDAIN TALL MEN OF GREAT STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE DISASTER OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS NOTE ARE PHYSICALLY SUPERIOR TO OTHER MEN MORE LIKE TO THE FIRST-BORN THAN ANY OTHER KINDRED OF MEN AKALLABÊTH GIMLI IS A DWARF AND ORCS WERE DESCRIBED AS BEING BY TRAINING AS TOUGH AS DWARVES IN ENDURING HARDSHIP MYTHS TRANSFORMED ORCS AND THEY GO WITH GREAT SPEED FOR ALL THAT DESTROYING THINGS IN THEIR PATH HACKING AND SLASHING AND THEY DO NOT TIRE THE DENATURE OF BOOMIER THE DWARVES ARE DESCRIBED AS BEING

STONE-HARD FAST IN FRIENDSHIP AND IN ENMITY AND THEY SUFFER TOIL AND HUNGER AND HURT OF BODY MORE HARDILY THAN ALL OTHER SPEAKING PEOPLE OF AUL AND SAVANNA

DWARVES TOO CAN GO SWIFTLY AND DO NOT TIRE SOONER THAN ORCS THE DENATURE OF BOOMIER

THE ELVES ARE MADE MORE LIKE IN NATURE TO THE AINU THOUGH LESS IN MIGHT AND STATURE OF THE BEGINNING OF DAYS AND LIKE THE DWARVES THEY CAN ALSO ENDURE GREATER HARDSHIPS THAN MEN AND RECOVER FROM INJURIES THAT MAY KILL A MANUAL ELVISH BODIES

WERE THUS CAPABLE OF FAR GREATER AND LONGER PHYSICAL EXERTIONS IN PURSUIT OF SOME DOMINATE PURPOSE OF THEIR MINDS WITHOUT WEARINESS THEY WERE NOT SUBJECT TO DISEASES THEY HEALED RAPIDLY AND COMPLETELY AFTER INJURIES THAT WOULD HAVE PROVED FATAL TO MEN AND THEY COULD ENDURE PHYSICAL PAIN FOR LONG PERIODS THE DEBATE OF FIBROID AND WANDRETH

EVEN SO THEY DO OF COURSE GET WEARY AS DEMONSTRATED BY FINGOLFIN IN HIS BATTLE WITH MORGOTH AT THE LAST THE KING GREW WEARY OF THE RUIN OF BELERIAND AND THE FALL OF FINGOLFIN

THEY RAN ABOUT MILES IN ALMOST FOUR DAYS

FORTY LEAGUES AND FIVE YOU HAVE MEASURED ERE THE FOURTH DAY IS ENDED THE RIDERS OF ROHAN

COLWYN FEELS NO MIGHTIER MEN HAD SHE SEEN THAN THE DÚNEDAIN AND AGAIN YET KNEW FOR SHE WAS BRED AMONG MEN OF WAR THAT HERE WAS ONE WHOM NO RIDER OF THE MARK WOULD OUTMATCH IN BATTLE IN BOTH OF THESE INSTANCES SHE IS REFERRING TO THE SUPERIORITY OF THE DÚNEDAIN OF THE NORTH AND OF THE SOUTH IN CONDOR ISILDUR HIMSELF RAN MOSTLY OVER MILES IN SEVERAL HOURS ON TREACHEROUS GROUND IN THE DARK BEFORE HE WAS KILLED IN THE ALNUIN HE WENT ON MORE WARILY FOR WIDE FLATS STRETCHED ON INTO THE GLOOM BEFORE HIM ROUGH AND PATHLESS WITH MANY TRAPS FOR WANDERING FEET DISASTER OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS THIS WAS DONE ALL IN ARMOUR AS WELL

HE CAST OFF ALL HIS ARMOUR AND WEAPONS SAVE A SHORT SWORD AT HIS BELT AND PLUNGED INTO THE WATER

OF THE THREE COMPANIONS ONLY PERGOLAS STEPPED AS LIGHTLY AS EVER AND ARAGON HAD DECLARED I AM WEARY WHILST FOR GIMLI THE CHASE BEGAN TO TELL ON HIM THE RIDERS OF ROHAN THEY WERE ACTUALLY LOSING GROUND TO THE ORCS SO MUCH SO THEY DESPAIRED THAT ONLY THE EAGLES COULD CATCH THEM NOW THERE IS ALSO THE IDEA THEY HAD THAT

THERE IS SOME WILL THAT LENDS SPEED TO OUR FOES AND SETS AN UNSEEN BARRIER BEFORE US A WEARINESS THAT IS IN THE HEART MORE THAN IN THE LIMB THE RIDERS OF ROHAN

THE ORCS DID REST AS DID THE THREE COMPANIONS THE ORCS WERE DRIVEN HARDER AND PERHAPS SAURURAN HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT AND ALSO WITH THE WEARINESS OF THE PURSUERS

THEY RESTED HERE A WHILE HE SAID BUT EVEN THE OUTWARD TRAIL IS ALREADY OLD I FEAR THAT YOUR HEART SPOKE TRULY PERGOLAS IT IS THRICE TWELVE HOURS I GUESS SINCE THE ORCS STOOD WHERE WE NOW STANDARD THE RIDERS OF ROHAN

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER THE THE ORCS ARE AT REST BEFORE DUSK ALL ABOUT THEM SAT OR STOOD A GREAT COMPANY OF ORCS THEN LATER ON THEY STOP AGAIN SUDDENLY HE WAS THROWN ON TO THE STONY FLOOR AGAIN IT WAS EARLY NIGHT BUT THE SLIM MOON WAS ALREADY FALLING WESTWARD THIS WAS WHEN THEY RECEIVED SOME TREATMENT A FEW MORE STOPS WERE MADE ALONG THE WAY

HOUR AFTER HOUR THEY RAN PAUSING NOW AND AGAIN ONLY TO SLING THE HOBBITS TO FRESH CARRIERS THE
THE WERE FINE TO RUN DAY AND NIGHT BUT CIRC SOME NORMAL ORCS JOINED UP WITH THEM PRETTY EARLY AND DEFINITELY BY THE TIME THEY GET TO ROHAN THEY HAVE A FEW HUNDRED ORCS THAT REALLY STRUGGLED TO MOVE A LONG WAY IN THE DAY TIME KINDA LIKE SEASICKNESS BUT WITH DAYLIGHT

ANYWAY THAT SLOWED THEM DOWN SOME MAYBE JUST BUT IT COULD BE ENOUGH FOR ARAGON AND CO TO GAIN ON THEM
WHY DO YOU THINK THE ORCS ARE SO MUCH FASTER THAN THEM ORCS HAVE TO REST TOO
ALL VERSIONS OF RETURN OF THE KING HAVE THE APPENDICES DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
MY ONLY ADVICE IS THAT YOU GET A SET AND NOT ALL THE STORIES IN A SINGLE BOOK IT'S A BIT LIKE COMPLETE WORKS LOOKS GREAT ON THE SHELF BUT IT'S NOT THE LEAST BIT PRACTICAL
THE DELUXE LEATHER-BOUND POCKET EDITION IS REALLY NICE IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON TRAVELING WITH THEM THEY ARE VERY DURABLE SMALL AND VISUALLY APPEALING THE TEXT IS RATHER SMALL HOWEVER SO IF YOUR EYESIGHT ISN'T THAT GREAT IT MAY NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE
HARPER COLLINS DELUXE HARDCOVER AND HARDSLEEVED LOAR BOOKS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITES AND CAN'T RECOMMEND THEM ENOUGH PRETTY PRICEY THOUGH
THANKS FOR POINTING OUT VAINAMONIEN I MUST NOW RESEARCH THIS MYSELF FOR MY OWN PLEASURE

WOULD BE AN INTERESTING CHARACTER TO INSERT INTO A STUDENT AMATEUR FLASH ANIMATION THAT I'M CREATING OF KULLERVO SO I THANK YOU AGAIN
I'VE READ PARTS OF IT ONE OF THESE DAYS I MAY GET AROUND TO THE WHOLE BIT SURE WISH I COULD READ IT IN FINNISH BUT I'M AFRAID MY BRAIN IS NOT OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL CALIBER
I READ A BUNCH OF THE KALEVALA IN FINNISH IN SCHOOL WHEN I WAS A TEEN BUT MY EXPERIENCE WAS MUCH LIKE WHAT I'D IMAGINE A BRITISH EXPERIENCE IS READING BEOWULF OR AN AMERICAN'S READING THE SONG OF HIAWATHA I RECOGNISED THE LANGUAGE AND ARCHETYPES BUT NEEDED THE EXPLANATIONS ON THE ADJACENT PAGE TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORDS AND EVENTS I THEN DIDN'T TOUCH THE BOOK FOR A GOOD TEN YEARS BUT I PICKED IT UP IN ENGLISH ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I SPENT A LOT OF TIME PUTTING TOGETHER THE MANY STORYLINES AND TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT LEMMINKAINEN IS THE SAME CHARACTER AS KAUKOMIELI ETC I DO INTEND TO READ IT FINNISH ONE SUMMER
YEAH I'M ABSOLUTELY STOKED FOR THIS I'M CONFIDENT THAT CHRISTOPHER WILL GIVE IT VERY GREAT TREATMENT PART OF ME WONDERS IF THERE WILL BE ANY ORIGINAL CONTENT OR EVEN NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE MATERIAL WITH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS BEING BROUGHT TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME

FOR SOME REASON I THOUGHT THAT WAS A PICTURE OF A CAKE THAT YOU MADE AND I IMAGINED HOW DELICIOUS IT WOULD TASTE UNTIL I SAW THE TREE BARK ON THE SIDES
I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE
YOU SHOULD MAKE COASTERS
DIDN'T SOMEONE POST THIS AS A TATTOO ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO NOT ANYTHING BAD BUT JUST WONDERING WHERE TO GET A HIGH RES SHOT OF THE ORIGINAL
IS THAT A SOLID WOOD DISC OR MANUFACTURED YOU DON'T SEE MANY OVAL TREES BUT FROM WHAT I CAN SEE OF THE RINGS THEY APPEAR TO BE OVAL TOO
I'M SORRY FOR MY IGNORANCE BUT WHAT IS THIS
LORD OF THE TREE RINGS
HOW MUCH ARE YOU CHARGING FOR THEM THEN SER
WHY THE BLACK SPEECH AROUND THE FELLOWSHIP BIT LIKE PUTTING A PICTURE OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES IN A PENTAGRAM
CHECK OUT R QUENDA AND R TENGWAR ASSUMING YOU MEAN ALPHABET NOT FONT



X FEET SO A BIT SMALL BUT HERE YOU GO
DID YOU FIND TICKETS I WENT TO THE ONE IN SEATTLE RECENTLY AND IT WAS AMAZING
HOW MANY DO YOU WANT OR NEED I MIGHT HAVE EXTRA BUT I'M NOT SURE YET HOW MANY OR EVEN IF I WILL HAVE EXTRA AT ALL BUT I'LL DEFINITELY KEEP YOU IN MIND DON'T RELY ON ME TO HAVE EXTRA THOUGH LOL
SO MANY THAT COULD MAKE A GREAT MOVIE PROBLEM IS THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE MADE A GREAT MOVIE AND FOR SURE THEY WON'T BE MADE INTO A MOVE ANY TIME SOON

HOWEVER IN MY HEAD THE ONLY WAY IT COULD BE DONE IS A SERIES OF LONG SHOWS FILMS LIKE HOW SHERLOCK IS DONE MOST COULD EASILY FILL A PAIR OF HOUR EPISODES

THE UNCHAINING OF MELIOR AND THE THEFT OF THE SILMARILS THROUGH THE BATTLE UNDER THE STARS
THE BATTLE OF SUDDEN FLAME THROUGH THE BATTLE OF UNNUMBERED TEARS
BEDEN AND LUTHIER
CHILDREN OF AURIN
QUOR AND THE FALL OF GONDONLIN
EARENDIL AND THE WAR OF WRATH
WAR OF THE ELVES AND SARON THROUGH THE FALL OF NOUMENON

ALL OF THESE WOULD HAVE THE ACTION SCENES THAT HOLLYWOOD SEEMS TO THINK ARE NECESSARY

I'D WATCH A TASTEFUL AKALABETH OR BEDEN LUTHIER MINISERIES
WITH ENOUGH BACKSTORY PRESENTED IMO I FEEL LIKE BEDEN AND LUTHIER COULD MAKE A REAL CONNECTION WITH A GENERAL AUDIENCE ONE NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE WHOLE THING AS MOST OF US ARE THAT IN TURN IF PROFITABLE ENOUGH COULD LEAD TO MORE OF THE TALES MAKING IT TO THE SCREEN BUT ISN'T THE MAJOR PROBLEM HERE WITH CHRISTOPHER NOT THAT I EVER HAVE OR EVER WILL FAULT HIM FOR HIS CHOICES HOWEVER
CAN CHECK OUT THE SILMARILLION SERIES SITE FOR A BREAKDOWN OF HOW ONE INDIVIDUAL WOULD BREAK UP THE SILMARILLION INTO MULTIPLE SEASONS AND WHAT EACH EPISODE WOULD COVER

THEY DID A PRETTY AWESOME JOB AT COVERING EVERYTHING IN A WAY THAT WOULD WORK
THE NORTH WIND BLOWS BUT WE SHALL OUTFLY IT SAID GWAIHIR AND HE LIFTED UP GANDALF AND SPED AWAY SOUTH AND WITH HIM WENT LANDROVAL AND MENELDOR YOUNG AND SWIFT

IN OTHER WORDS NUMBER
RESPECT THE EAGLES BRO THEIR THREE NAMES WERE GWAIHIR LANDROVAL AND MENELDOR
GANDALF DOESN'T BRING THE EAGLES ANYWHERE THE EAGLES DO WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT TO
I BELIEVE SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN UP HOPE I THINK
THANK YOU FOR THIS I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHY EAGLES WENT UP TO MOUNT DOOM AND IT NEVER EVEN CROSSED MY MIND ABOUT THAT IT WAS ABOUT SMEAGOL
THAT IS ASSUMING ONE EAGLE CAN'T CARRY MORE THAN ONE HOBBIT
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY WAY FOR GANDALF TO KNOW FOR SURE THAT SMEAGOL WAS WITH FRODO AND IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL HE SUSPECTED THAT SMEAGOL MAY HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY BUT HE FELL IN MORIA BEFORE FRODO TAMED SMEAGOL IN ELYN MAIL
OH SHIT GANDALF YOU THE REAL MVP
WOW GUYS CAN ANYONE TAKE A JOKE OBV A FUCKING FOOT EAGLE ISN'T FLYING INTO THE BLACK LANDS WITHOUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND OF ORKS GOBLINS TROLLS SHADES AND SOME MAGICAL FUCKING EVIL DEITY NOTICING AND STOPPING THEM
BOOK GANDALF IS PRETTY MEAN ABOUT OF THE USES OF THE WORD FOOL ARE ATTRIBUTED TO HIM AND IT'S USED A BUNCH
I WOULD SAY THAT THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS IN GANDALF THE WHITE RATHER THAN GANDALF THE GREY IN THE MOVIES HIS REBIRTH FEELS A BIT LIKE AN UPGRADE HE IS MORE POWERFUL MORE WISE AND MORE DETERMINED BUT STILL VULNERABLE IN THE BOOKS HE TAKES ON A MORE FEEL WHEN HE CONFRONTS SAURURAN HE COMPLETELY DOMINATES HIM IT IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHEN THE READER CAN REALLY APPRECIATE HOW MUCH GREATER HE HAS BECOME

IN THE MOVIES HE IS SHOWN TO BE MORE VULNERABLE IN A MORTAL SENSE NOT LIKE A MORTAL BUT RATHER KILLABLE DON'T GET ME WRONG HE CAN BE KILLED JUST AS SAURURAN CAN BE KILLED BUT THAT IS NEVER IMMINENT IN THE BOOKS PIPPEN DOESN'T SAVE HIM FROM AN ORC THE WITCH KING DOESN'T BREAK HIS STAFFORDSHIRE HE DOESN'T PARTICIPATE IN A SUICIDE CHARGE AT THE BLACK GATE RATHER BOOK SENSE OF DREAD COMES FROM THE ALWAYS PRESENT POSSIBILITY OF FAILURE HE SAYS THAT HE IS THE GREATEST POWER IN MIDDLE EARTH SAVE FOR SARON HIMSELF HE SAYS THAT HE'LL BE THERE TO THE BITTER END EVEN IF HE'S ALL THAT'S LEFT HIS FATE WOULD BE TRAGIC IF HIS MISSION FAILS BUT WE NEVER FEEL AS THOUGH THERE IS ANY MOMENT WHEN HE IS IN ANY PERSONAL DANGER EVEN THE TENSION OF HIS CONFRONTATION WITH THE NAGUAL COMES FROM THE EXISTENTIAL RATHER THAN THE PERSONAL

A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS COMES AT THE FINAL BATTLE GANDALF IS SEEN ON A HILL MOUNTED ON SHADOWFAX HE IS LIKE A BEACON OF LIGHT AND NO SHADOW FALLS ON HIM IN A SEA OF DARKNESS HE IS STOIC PEERING INTO MORDOR READING THE SIGNS HE REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE AN ENTITY FROM ANOTHER PLACE CARRYING A GREAT POWER IN THE MOVIES HE FEELS A BIT MORE HUMAN WHICH I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE BUT THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT JUST HOW MUCH MORE ASCENDED GANDALF THE WHITE FEELS IN THE BOOKS
I THINK MCKELLEN BROUGHT A LARGE PORTION OF WARMTH AND KINDNESS TO GANDALF THOUGH SOMETIMES BOOK GANDALF SHINES THROUGH WITH THE FOOL REMARKS HE IS SOMETIMES JOVIAL IN THE BOOKS TOO BUT MUCH OF THE HUMOUR IS DEFINITELY NEW IN THE FILMS
TO KICK OFF THE DISCUSSION I ALWAYS IMAGINED GANDALF TO BE QUIETER MORE DISTANT LOST IN THOUGHT OR IN MEMORIES BUT PUNCTUATED WITH MOMENTS OF INTENSE PRESENCE AND SINGLE-MINDED FOCUS

MOVIE GANDALF IS A LITTLE TOO YOUTHFUL AND EASY-GOING
I READ THE BOOKS AFTER SEEING THE FILMS SO MY PERCEPTION OF GANDALF IS DEFINITELY INFLUENCED BY PERFORMANCE BUT I DO AGREE WITH THE OTHER REPLIES BOOK GANDALF SEEMED MORE BRUSQUE AND MEAN AT TIMES AND IT'S HARD TO SAY PRECISELY WHY BUT THE PROSE GANDALF JUST HAD AN ODD SENSE OF MYSTERIOUS POWER TO HIM THAN THE FILM COUNTERPART NEVER QUITE MANAGED TO SHOW THOUGH MCKELLEN WAS OF COURSE FANTASTIC ODDLY ENOUGH THE GANDALF I PICTURE ACTUALLY RESEMBLES CHRISTOPHER LEE MORE IN SOME WAYS IN MY MINDS EYE GANDALF IS TALLER OLDER AND MORE IMPOSING THAN MCKELLEN
TOO MUCH DIRECT ACTION AND NOT ENOUGH INDIRECT INFLUENCE I UNDERSTAND WHY THOUGH IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO SHOW SUBTLE INFLUENCER GANDALF IN AN ACTION MOVIE HE'S GOT TO JUST STEP UP AND KICK ASS OR YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THE AUDIENCE
I SAW THE MOVIES LONG LONG BEFORE I READ THE BOOKS SO MOVIE GANDALF IS MY BOOK GANDALF ALTHOUGH BOOK GANDALF SEEMS A TAD BIT MORE GRUMPY
YEAH I'M GOING TO GO WITH MOVIE GANDALF BEING MUCH MORE OPEN WITH HIS AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHICH I HONESTLY LOVE ADDS A WHOLE NEW DEPTH OF CHARACTER TO HIM HE DOESN'T JUST GUARD THE WORLD FROM EVIL HE CARES ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN IT
ONE IS FROM THE CANADIAN AND THE OTHER IS FROM THE US ITUNES STORE

MAYBE THAT'S WHAT IT IS
BANE WAS VERY LIKELY THE LAST REMAINING BARONG IT WAS THOUGHT ALL OF THEM WERE KILLED IN THE WAR OF WRATH AND VERY LIKELY ALL THE OTHERS WERE THERE WAS NEVER A GREAT MANY OF THEM ANYWAY
AS MENTIONED EVER SO WELL ALREADY BANE WAS LIKELY THE LAST HOWEVER IT'S STILL AMBIGUOUS ENOUGH THAT WE CAN ASSUME PONDER THAT SOMEWHERE SOMEWHERE DEEP IN A STRANGE PLACE OF THE WORLD ANOTHER MAY BE LURKING AROUND WE CANNOT SAY FOR SURE EITHER AND THAT'S KINDA THE BEAUTY OF IT
YEAH SO I KNOW THIS STORY ISN'T PART OF THE THIRD AGE AND I'VE SIMPLIFIED THE DETAILS OF THE STORY BUT I LOVE THE ONE ABOUT THE DARK LORD MORGOTH WHO'S IN A BATTLE AGAINST THE GREAT SPIDER UNGOLIANT MORGOTH WAS ON THE VERGE OF DEFEAT AND IN HIS WEAKENED STATE HE SUMMONED HIS SERVANTS FROM THE DEEP A LOUD CRY OF DESPERATION FROM MORGOTH PENETRATED DEEP INTO THE WALLS OF SINGBAND AND WAS HEEDED BY GOTHMOG AND THE BARONGS AND THEY RESCUED HIM FROM HER CLUTCHES DRIVING UNGOLIANT AWAY WITH THEIR WHIPS THE IDEA OF SEEING THIS STORY IN A VISUAL CINEMATIC FORM GIVES ME THE CHILLS
I LIKE TO THINK THE WATCHER IN THE WATER IS PREGGO W BABY
IN THE UNFINISHED TALES IT TALKS ABOUT MANY FLEEING PAST CHUN TO THE RED MOUNTAINS I'D WAGER THERE ARE STILL SOME THERE
I ALWAYS WONDERED ALONG THOSE LINES AS WELL WHEN I WAS READING THE SILMARILLION FOR THE FIRST TIME I READ ABOUT THE LIST ALLIES OF THEM THERE WERE BARONGS AND I DID A DOUBLE TAKE BARONGS
THERE IS A CHANCE THAT UNGOLIANT WAS STILL ROAMING AROUND SOMEWHERE NO ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO HERALDRY
I REMEMBER READING SOMETHING ABOUT MORE BARONGS BEING OUT THERE IN UNFINISHED TALES BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO AND I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THERE ARE MORE OUT THERE
FIRST THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR THE REST OF US IF YOU QUOTED SPECIFIC PASSAGES THAT YOU'RE THINKING OF AND DESCRIBED YOUR THOUGHTS IN SOME DETAIL BEYOND THE WORD EVIDENT

SECOND THOUGHT SADLY PEOPLE DO CHANGE EVEN AFTER GETTING MARRIED
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER IT WOULD BE OF IMMENSE HELP TO ACTUALLY QUOTE WHATEVER IS TROUBLING YOU
I SAY LET'S ALL CALL OURSELVES HOBBITS AND HOLD A CONTEST TO FIND OUT

SERIOUSLY SPEAKING SEEING THAT BLOKE AT THE START OF THE FILM CARRYING A LARGE BARREL OVER HIS SHOULDER I'D HAVE TO SURMISE IT'D BE QUITE A BIT DESPITE THEIR SMALL STATURE
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT STORY IN THE MYTHOS AND DESERVES THIS TREATMENT I'M CERTAIN CHRISTOPHER AND HIS STAFF HAVE TREATED THIS MATERIAL WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO TZOLKIN HIMSELF
FOR THOSE WONDERING THERE'S A BIT OF CONFUSION OF JUST WHAT EXACTLY THIS IS IS IT A COLLECTION OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE STORY OR A COMPILED NARRATIVE LIKE CHILDREN OF AURIN I'VE COMPILED INFO FROM VARIOUS SOURCES HERE PLENTY OF THEM SEEMINGLY CONFLICT EACH OTHER
THIS IS THE BEST TL R I COULD MAKE ORIGINAL REDUCED BY I'M A BOT

JNR LEGEND OF THE MORTAL MAN BEDEN AND THE IMMORTAL ELF LATHEN A STORY THAT MEANT SO MUCH TO THE LORD OF THE RINGS AUTHOR THAT THE CHARACTERS NAMES ARE ENGRAVED ON THE HEADSTONE SHARED BY HIM AND HIS WIFE IS TO BE PUBLISHED NEXT YEAR

FATHER AN ELVISH LORD IS AGAINST THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND SO GIVES BEDEN AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK TO FULFIL BEFORE THE TWO CAN BE MARRIED SAID HARPERCOLLINS WHICH WILL PUBLISH BEDEN AND LATHEN NEXT MAY THE PAIR THEN GO ON TO ROB THE GREATEST OF ALL EVIL BEINGS MELIOR CALLED MORGOTH THE BLACK ENEMY OF A SILMARIL OR JEWEL

ALTHOUGH NO FURTHER MIDDLE-EARTH TITLES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED SINCE THE CHILDREN OF ARIN A HOST OF PREVIOUSLY UNPUBLISHED WORKS BY THE LORD OF THE RINGS AUTHOR HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM HIS RETELLING OF A FINNISH LEGEND THE STORY OF KULLERVO TO HIS POEM THE FALL OF ARTHUR AND HIS TRANSLATION OF THE CENTURY ANGLO-SAXON POEM BEOWULF



EXTENDED SUMMARY FAQ VERSION TL RS SO FAR THEORY FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS ARE MONITORED CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK IS WELCOME TOP KEYWORDS LATHEN STORY 2 BEDEN TZOLKIN PUBLISH
I WONDER WHAT IT'LL LOOK LIKE WHEN IT COMES OUT IN PAPERBACK IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT MATCHED UP WITH THE REST OF MY ALAN LEE ILLUSTRATED PAPERBACKS
I'M CONFUSED HOW WILL THIS DIFFER FROM THE STORY IN THE SILMARILLION
ILLUSTRATED BY ALAN LEE BTW THIS SHOULD MAKE IT A MUST BUY TO ADD TO YOUR BOOK SHELF
I MADE A COMMENT AND WAS REPLIED TO WITH A HISTORY LESSON DESIGNED TO SET ME STRAIGHT

IF BY SELF CENTERED YOU MEAN WELL INFORMED ON TZOLKIN THEN I GUESS I'M SELF CENTERED
FIRST OF ALL I DON'T NEED A HISTORY LESSON I'M QUITE WELL AWARE OF PLACE AS HIS FATHER'S EXECUTOR

SECONDLY JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING CAN BE PUBLISHED IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED IT SHOULD BE ALMOST EVERYTHING TZOLKIN HAS EVER WRITTEN HAS BEEN DRAGGED OUT AND RELEASED DESPITE MUCH OF IT BEING UNFINISHED INCLUDING THE SILMARILLION ITSELF

AS FOR WHERE THE AUTHOR WOULD STAND IN REGARDS TO THE FILMS IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT HE WAS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE ZIMMERMAN DRAFT THAT ACKERMAN PLANNED TO PRODUCE I HAVE COPIES OF THE SCREENPLAY IN QUESTION COMPLETE WITH HANDWRITTEN NOTES IN THE MARGINS AND I CAN CONFIRM THAT MANY OF THE THINGS HE OBJECTED TO WERE IMPLEMENTED BY PETER JACKSON IN THAT CASE YOU'RE DEFINITELY RIGHT
GREAT MORE ARCHAEOLOGICAL GRAVEROBBING COURTESY OF THAT CURMUDGEONLY CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN THE GUY WHO CLAIMS THAT P CHEAPENS HIS FATHER'S LEGACY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PUBLISHING EVERY GROCERY LIST HE UNEARTHS
I'D LOVE TO HELP BUT I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED ON WHICH CLOAK OR CLOAKS YOU ARE REFERRING TO WHICH CHARACTER OR CHARACTERS WEAR THE CLOAK IN QUESTION

AT WAR WITH THE CORSAIRS OF AMBAR

SUFFERING THROUGH THE GREAT PLAGUE

AT WAR WITH THE WAINRIDERS OF THE EASTERN

ETC

CONDOR WAS UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM BOTH SOUTH AND EAST WHEN AFNOR WAS FALLING TO INGMAR AND THEY STILL MANAGED TO GATHER TOGETHER A BIG ENOUGH ARMY TO ANNIHILATE THE KINGDOM

THEY JUST ARRIVED TOO LATE TO HELP AFNOR
WHERE WAS CONDOR WHEN THE WESTFIELD FELL WHERE WAS GON
WELL FOR A LONG TIME AFNOR WAS DIVIDED AND DIDN'T EXIST AS A UNITED KINGDOM DURING THAT TIME THERE IS NO RECORD OF CONTACT BETWEEN AFNOR AND CONDOR UNTIL TA SO THE TWO KINGDOMS WERE ESTRANGED AND AFNOR COULD NOT ASK FOR HELP FROM ITS MIGHTIER SIBLING
I STILL PLAY BEME 2 I LOVE THAT GAME
CONDOR AND AFNOR ARTHEDAIN ONLY RENEWED COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THEM IN WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY WERE VICTIMS OF A SIMULTANEOUS ASSAULT FROM THE SAME WILLIAM SON ARVEDUI MARRIED DAUGHTER FRIZEL IN THIS ALLIANCE YET HELP COULD NOT BE SENT FROM EITHER SIDE TO THE OTHER SINCE INGMAR WAS ATTACKING THE NORTH AND THE WAINRIDERS ATTACKING CONDOR IN THE SOUTHERN

IN THIS PERIOD CONDOR ALMOST FELL APART BEFORE ARTHEDAIN DID SINCE THE WAINRIDERS WITH THEIR ALLIES FROM HAND HAD KILLED ONDOHER AND HIS SONS AND ROUTED HIS ARMY HIS COUSIN EÄRNIL LATER SAVED THE DAY DUE TO THE INCOMPETENCE OF THE WAINRIDERS WHO SAT ON THEIR HAUNCHES AFTER DEFEATING THE NORTHERN ARMY LED BY ONDOHER EÄRNIL FIRST HAD TO DEAL WITH THE ARMY FROM ARAD IN SOUTH ITHILIEN BEFORE HE ABSORBED THE REMNANTS OF THE NORTHERN ARMY INTO HIS OWN TO TAKE OUT THE WAINRIDERS WHO DID NOT FINISH THE JOB AS YOU CAN SEE CONDOR ITSELF WAS NEARLY TOPPLED IN SO THERE WAS NO WAY AT THIS TIME THEY COULD AID THE NORTH ARTHEDAIN

EVEN AFTER HE WAS CROWNED KING IN THE SOUTH EÄRNIL HAD HIS OWN PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH ALTHOUGH HE PROMISED TO SEND AID WHEN HE COULD TO ARVEDUI EÄRNIL WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY SECURE TO DO AS HE PROMISED CONDOR AND THE HEIRS OF ANÁRION AND SENT AID TOO LATE WHEN HE COULD IN THIS FORCE IS ACTUALLY DESCRIBED AS A SMALL SENDING FORCE OF THE WHOLE MIGHT OF CONDOR CONDOR AND THE HEIRS OF ANÁRION ALTHOUGH TO THE REFUGEES UP NORTH WHO HAD FLED TO LINDON THIS APPEARED TO BE A GREAT FORCE OF MEN

THIS PERIOD OF ALLIANCE ASIDE EACH KINGDOM WAS DOING ITS OWN THING BEFORE THE REALIZATION THAT THEY WERE UNDER ASSAULT BY A COMMON FOE IN THE NORTH THERE WAS THEIR OWN STRIFE AS THE KINGDOM BROKE INTO THREE PARTS RULED BY ONE OF THE SONS OF EÄRENDUR IN CONDOR THEY TOO HAD THEIR OWN STRIFE WHEN MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE COULD NOT ACCEPT THE INHERITANCE OF ELDACAR AND FOUGHT A LONG CIVIL WAR AMONG THEMSELVES WHEN ELDACAR WAS OUSTED AFTER FIVE YEARS HIS COUSIN CASTAMIR AND THE CLOSEST OF THE CONFEDERATES TO THE THRONE RULED FOR TEN YEARS BEFORE ELDACAR RETURNED IN FORCE AND OVERTHREW HIM WITHIN A YEAR'S TIME OF FIGHTING THIS WAS A PERIOD OF YEARS FROM TO EVEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS THEY WERE CONSTANTLY FIGHTING THE HARADRIM AND CORSAIRS THE HEIRS OF CASTAMIR HAD MADE A REFUGE FOR ALL THE ENEMIES OF THE KING AND A LORDSHIP INDEPENDENT OF HIS CROWN CONDOR AND THE HEIRS OF ANÁRION AT AMBAR

IN THE NORTH THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENING THE THREE KINGDOMS WERE CONSTANTLY FIGHTING EACH OTHER AND INGMAR TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEIR DISUNION BY THE EARLY THE KINGS IN RHUDAUR AND CAROLAN DIED OUT AND THE LAST PRINCE OF CAROLAN WAS KILLED IN IN THE INVASION BY INGMAR
PERHAPS NOT REALLY AN ANSWER BUT THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS THE FELLOWSHIP A FEW TIMES ARAGON DOES SO WHEN HE SAYS FAREWELL TO GIMLI AND PERGOLAS

HERE THEN AT LAST COMES THE ENDING OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING SAID
ARAGON YET I HOPE THAT ERE LONG YOU WILL RETURN TO MY LAND WITH THE HELP
THAT YOU PROMISED

AND GANDALF HAS A SIMILAR PHRASE WHEN HE SAYS GOODBYE TO THE HOBBITS AT THE GREY HAVENS

AND THIS IS REALLY PURE SPECULATION ON MY PART BUT PERHAPS ELROD USES MORE FANCY WORDS SUCH AS THE COMPANY VERSUS THE GERMANIC FELLOWSHIP
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS JUST BECAUSE COMPANY SOUNDS LESS PERSONAL THAN FELLOWSHIP AND SINCE THEY HAD JUST BEEN FORMED AND JUST MET ELROD WOULD CALL THEM THE COMPANY OF THE RING AND THEN THEY REFERRED TO THEMSELVES LATER AS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING SHOWING THAT THEY HAD BECOME MORE THAN JUST ALLIES BUT ALSO FRIENDS
WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY IF IT TURNS OUT THAT FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING WAS JUST A LAST-MINUTE CHANGE TZOLKIN MADE BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT COMPANY OF THE RING SOUNDED DUMB
I REMEMBER THE TERM BEING USED RATHER FREQUENTLY OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD GANDALF SAYS WELL HERE AT LAST DEAR FRIENDS ON THE SHORES OF THESDA COMES THE END OF OUR FELLOWSHIP IN MIDDLE-EARTH WHEN HE FRODO BILBO GALADRIEL ELROD WERE DEPARTING FROM THE GREY HAVENS
YEP PRECISELY WHAT ELROD HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT THAT'S THE WAY I ALWAYS TOOK IT ANYWAY
IF SO COULD HE HAVE USED THE POWER OF THE RING FOR HIMSELF

HE THOUGHT HE COULD

IT JUST ISN'T CLEAR WHETHER HE WAS CORRECT OR NOT WRESTING CONTROL OF THE RING FROM SARON WOULD BE LUDICROUSLY DIFFICULT AND EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS

BUT TO BE FAIR SAURURAN HAD A BETTER CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING THAN ANYONE ELSE IN MIDDLE EARTH
I BELIEVE SAURURAN WAS CORRUPTED BY THE RING SARON DUE TO HIS CONSTANT COMMUNICATIONS USING THE PALANTIR BECAUSE OF THIS HE JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE NOT NAMED SARON STARTED WANTING THE RING FOR HIMSELF

I BELIEVE THAT SARON KNEW THIS AND WAS USING SAURURAN AS ANOTHER MEANS TO HAVE THE RING RETURNED TO HIM IF SAURURAN CAPTURED FRODO AND TOOK THE RING IT WOULD ONLY BE A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL IT FOUND ITS WAY BACK TO SARON
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I'VE ONLY JUST READ THE FIRST TWO BOOKS FOR AND TT BUT IT'S BEEN SAID A FEW TIMES BY GANDALF I THINK AND GALADRIEL THAT ONLY SARON CAN TRULY USE THE RING HOW HE WANTS TO

I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE EVIL ENERGY OR CORRUPTION THAT IS BAKED INTO IT I THINK SARON IS THE ONLY ONE THAT ALIGNS PERFECTLY WITH THAT ATTITUDE THAT MAGNITUDE OF EVIL IN THAT WAY IT'S LIKE THEY'RE A PERFECT PAIR IT ALSO SOUNDED LIKE IT WOULD CORRUPT ANYONE ELSE THAT USES IT

ALSO CIRC SARON MADE THE RING HIMSELF SO THE RING IS ATTACHED TO HIM THROUGHOUT THE BOOKS SO FAR THE NARRATOR AND THE WISE CHARACTERS IN IT MENTION THAT THE RING SEEKS ITS MASTER PARAPHRASED SO I THINK THAT NO MATTER WHO ELSE HAS IT AND HOW STRONG THEY ARE THE RING WILL STRIVE TO BE WITH SARON AGAIN

MEANWHILE SAURURAN DID WANT IT HIMSELF I'M PRETTY SURE HAVING JUST READ THE BOOK EVIDENCE FOR THIS IS GANDALF SAID SO PLUS HE SEEMED TO HAVE ORDERED HIS OWN BAND OF ORCS TO TAKE THE RING TO HIM RATHER THAN DIRECTLY TO SARON I THINK THIS CAME OUT IN THE ARGUMENTS BETWEEN THE ORC WHILE PIPPIN AND MERRY WERE HELD PRISONERS

ANYWAY HE WANTED IT FOR HIMSELF LIKE ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE WORLD AND HE THOUGHT HE COULD HARNESS ITS POWER I THINK THIS BELIEF WAS CREATED BY THE CORRUPTION OF THE RING AND HIS GROWING HUBRIS WHICH STEMMED FROM HIS STRONG ARMY AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF HIS LORD

I THINK AT SOME POINT GANDALF EXPLICITLY SAID SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF SAURURAN THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD BE MASTER OVER THE RING BUT IT ONLY RECOGNIZES ONE TRUE MASTER OVER ITSELF SARON

WISH I HAD SOME ACTUAL QUOTES BUT THEY'RE HARD TO FIND INSIDE SO MANY PAGES HAHA
IF YOU NAME YOUR GARAGE ISENGARD THEN YOU COULD DRIVE YOUR CAR HOME SINGING I'M TAKING THE HOBBIT TO ISENGARD
I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE SHIRE AND BAGGIES
SAW YOU THE OTHER DAY
CUTE

GETTING AS MY JEEP IS CALLED SO BUT THE REAL SPELLING IS TAKEN
DELETED
I WAS HOPING FOR BEDEN AND LUTHIER BUT THIS IS PRETTY COOL TOO
I FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD BE NORTH AND SOUTH DAKOTA
SOMETIMES I FORGET NORTH DAKOTA IS A STATE BEAUTIFUL STATE THOUGH SEEMS LIKE A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE
NICE
RAF
I NEED TO GET ONE OF THOSE RING INSCRIPTION VINYLS
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY DRIVE INTO MORDOR
SO CAN YOU GET THE SAME LICENCE PLATE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES BECAUSE I'M SURE I'VE SEEN MORDOR BEFORE
WOW HOW MUCH DID THOSE THINGS COST HERE IN THE UK I THINK INTERESTING VEHICLE REGISTRATION NUMBERS GO UP FOR AUCTION
YOU TWO ARE ADORABLE NO WAY MY WIFE WOULD LET ME GO FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS

GREEN WITH ENVY
THIS IS DEFIANTLY RELATIONSHIP GOALS
THE LORD OF THE RINGS WAS A VERY LONG STORY TOLD OVER THREE VOLUMES OR SIX BOOKS IT WAS WRITTEN DENSELY WITH MANY CHARACTERS AND EVENTS HAPPENING AS WELL AS LONG-WINDED DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS IMMENSE AND SO INSTEAD OF CONDENSING IT DOWN TO A SINGLE MOVIE P AND CO TOLD THE STORY OVER THREE MOVIES MOSTLY CORRESPONDING TO THE THREE VOLUMES SO WHEN THE MOVIES WERE ADAPTED FROM THE BOOKS MOST OF THE EVENTS AND CHARACTERS WERE PRESERVED IN THE TRANSITION WITH FEW ADDITIONS MADE WHILE THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONABLE DECISIONS MADE IN THE ADAPTATION OVERALL IT CAPTURED THE BOOKS QUITE WELL

THE HOBBIT ON THE OTHER HAND IS A CHILDREN'S BOOK IT IS A SHORT BOOK GENERALLY PUBLISHED WITH LARGE SPACED FONT THE BOOKS HAS EXACTLY TWO DEVELOPED CHARACTERS BILBO AND THORIN IT'S A SHORT ROMP THROUGH A FANTASY WORLD THAT FOLLOWS BILBO AND THORIN FROM ONE SMALL ENCOUNTER TO THE NEXT WHERE THE HEART OF THE SMALL HOBBIT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARMIES OR WEAPONS THE HOBBIT TAKES A COUPLE HOURS TO READ AND YET P AND CO DECIDED TO EXPAND THE ADAPTATION INTO THREE LONG MOVIES SO INCREDIBLY IT TAKES A LONGER TIME TO WATCH THE MOVIES THAN IT DOES TO READ THE BOOK IN ORDER TO STRETCH A THREE HOUR BOOK INTO NINE HOURS OF MOVIE P ADDED IN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNTS OF BLOAT TO THE MOVIES ALMOST ALL OF WHICH DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE TONE OF THE BOOK LUDICROUS ACTION SEQUENCES IRRELEVANT SIDEQUESTS AND STUPID CONSPIRACIES TAKE THE MOVIES AWAY FROM THE TITLE CHARACTER AND INSTEAD MAKE IT ABOUT AN WITH A PLOT THAT MOVES AT A SNAILS PACE

THE HOBBIT MOVIES ARE AN INSULT TO THE BOOK IT'S AS IF P DECIDED TO MAKE AN ENTIRE TRILOGY OF JUST THE TWO SCENES IN LOAR WHERE PERGOLAS SLIDES DOWN A STAIRCASE AND WHEN HE KILLS THAT MUMAKIL MARTIN BILBO IS THE ONLY REDEEMING FACTOR OF THE MOVIES AND EVEN THEN THEY SHUNTED HIM OFF TO THE SIDELINES

HELL THE FINAL MOVIE STRETCHED ONLY A HANDFUL OF PAGES INTO AN POINTLESS BATTLE WITH ACTION THAT ISN'T EVEN ANY GOOD AND THEN THEY HAVE THE GALL TO REMOVE THORIN BEING BURIED WITH THE ARKENSTONE WHICH WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THE LAST ONE AND A HALF MOVIES THAT'S NOT JUST BAD ADAPTATION THAT'S BAD IN GENERAL

MOVIE 2 HAS THE DWARVES GIVING UP AND GOING HOME AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF NOT FINDING THE KEYHOLE EXCHANGE WITH SMUG WAS PRETTY GOOD MARTIN FREEMAN BUT THEN THE DWARVES CAME IN AND SUDDENLY IT BECAME A CHASE

DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON TAURINE I WISH P COULD AT LEAST HAVE HAD THE DECENCY TO HAVE HIS TOKEN FEMALE CHARACTER NOT EXIST SOLELY AS A LOVE INTEREST TO MAKE US CARE ABOUT DEATH MORE IT'S LITERALLY DUMBER THAN HAVING ZERO FEMALE CHARACTERS WHICH THE ORIGINAL DID MOSTLY FINE

OH AND OF COURSE IN THE ACTUAL TIMELINE AGOG WAS LONG DEAD BUT I GUESS THEY NEEDED AN ANTAGONIST THAT WASN'T BELG COMPLETELY MADE-UP BACKSTORY TO MAKE THE ANTAGONIST MORE PERSONAL BUT OF COURSE ALL IT DOES IS CONTINUE TO MAKE THE HOBBIT LESS ABOUT THE HOBBIT

I'M RANTING NOW SO I'M GOING TO CUT MYSELF OFF WITH THE FOLLOWING REMARK THE HOBBIT TRILOGY IS A TRAVESTY AND A FAILURE NOT JUST AS AN ADAPTATION BUT AS MOVIES ALTOGETHER THE MOVIES ARE LITTLE MORE THAN A FEW SILLY ACTION SEQUENCES TIED TOGETHER BY A PLOT THAT MANAGES TO BOTH BE EXTREMELY SLOW AND BLOATED AS ALL HELL IT INSULTS THE SOURCE MATERIAL BY REMOVING ALL CHARM AND SHUNTING THE MAIN CHARACTER TO THE SIDE AND YET FAILS TO DEVELOP ANY OF THE MANY EXTRA CHARACTERS IT ADDS I AWARD IT NO POINTS AND MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON ITS SOUL
THE MOVIES ARE SORT OF STRETCHED LIKE BUTTER SCRAPED OVER TOO MUCH BREAD

BUT SERIOUSLY THE FILM MAKERS FAILED BY TRYING TO MAKE ANOTHER TRILOGY LIKE FLOTER IMPORTANT SCENES WERE LEFT OUT AND COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY SCENES WERE ADDED THEY MESSED WITH INTERESTING CHARACTERS AND JUST SPOILED THE BEAUTIFUL IMAGES TZOLKIN CREATED FOR INSTANCE PERGOLAS WHO JUST ACTED COMPLETELY OUT OF CHARACTER IN THE HOBBIT MOVIES
WARNING RANT INCOMING

IT EXPANDED ONE BOOK ABOUT HALF THE LENGTH OF FELLOWSHIP ALONE INTO A FULL TRILOGY THIS MEANS THAT THE FILMS ESPECIALLY 2 ARE MORE FILLER THAN CANON NOTICE HOW YOU COULD REMOVE THE SCENES WITH TAURINE IN THEM AND IT WOULDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOT A COINCIDENCE POINTLESS CHASE SCENES OF COURSE REMEMBER WHEN SMUG FELL FOR THE HEY LOOK OVER HERE TRICK MULTIPLE TIMES LIKE A SCOOBY DOO VILLAIN

LOAR WAS HIGHLY PRAISED FOR ITS INCREDIBLE USE OF COSTUMES AND PRACTICAL EFFECTS WHEREAS THE HOBBIT DID PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IT COULD DIGITALLY ONE EXAMPLE IS LOAR USING AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY OF FILMING FORCED PERSPECTIVE WHILE THE HOBBIT WAS A GIANT GREENSCREEN WHEN FILMING TALL PEOPLE WITH SHORT PEOPLE ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS HOW AGOG THE MAIN ANTAGONIST CLEARLY LOOKS MORE FAKE THAN GENERIC ORCS IN THE BACKGROUND OF LOAR LET'S NOT FORGET THE COPY PASTE ELDEN ARMY IN BFA

THERE ARE ALSO SOME HILARIOUSLY CORNY LOOKING FIGHT SCENES LIKE BOMBOUS DURING BARRELS OUT OF BOND OR THE BRIDGE COLLAPSE IN GOBLIN TOWN SAME WITH THE SLOW MO SHOT OF ELVES JUMPING OVER THE DWARVES SHIELD WALL A HORRIBLE TACTICAL MOVE AND A CHEESY SHOT ALL IN ONE

THEN THERE'S THAT LITTLE BASTARD WORKING FOR THE MASTER OF LAKE TOWN I SERIOUSLY CAN'T BELIEVE THEY GAVE SO MUCH TIME TO SUCH A WORTHLESS CHARACTER EVEN WORSE THAN JAR JAR BANKS

THERE'S PLENTY MORE BUT THE MAIN POINT IS THAT THEY GAVE LITTLE REGARD TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL AND OFTEN CAME UP WITH RIDICULOUS FILLER JUST SO THEY COULD CASH IN ON MEDIOCRE MOVIES INSTEAD OF ONE OR TWO DECENT ONES
IN THE LOAR FILMS THEY HAD TO CUT A LOT OUT FROM THE BOOKS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM COHERENT
WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO STRETCH OUT THE HOBBIT FILMS I WAS OPTIMISTIC THEY USED THIS AS A CHANCE TO INCLUDE SOME OF THE WORLD BUILDING AND CHARACTERS THAT HAD TO BE CUT OUT OF THE LOAR FILMS UNFORTUNATELY THE EXTRA TIME WAS TAKEN UP BY POINTLESS FILLER DRAWN OUT CGI BATTLE SCENES AND REFERENCES TO THE LOAR TRILOGY WHICH IS ANNOYING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT MOMENTS IN THE HOBBIT TRILOGY WHICH SHOW HOW GOOD IT BEEN IF THEY MADE ONLY OR 2 MOVIES INSTEAD
THE ORCS ARE TOO BIG

ODD THING TO PICK OUT I KNOW BUT I'M SICK OF EVERYONE JUMPING ON THE WARHAMMER ORC BANDWAGON THEY LATER MADE FOR A REASON

ALSO EVERYTHING THAT WILLIE SAID
THIS IS AWESOME I'VE BEEN ENVISIONING SOMETHING SIMILAR FOR OUR ANNOUNCEMENT
THAT CHILD IS GOING TO HAVE A GREAT ADVENTURE

AWESOME CONGRATULATIONS
CONGRATULATIONS OP

YOU SHOULD TOTALLY POST THIS IN R PICS
ONE OF MY BEST MEMORIES AS A CHILD WAS BEING READ THE HOBBIT AND LOAR OUT LOUD BY MY DAD WITH VOICES
THIS IS SO CUTE MANY CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND YOUR WIFE
CONGRATS WHERE CAN I BUY THE PICTURE WOULD LIKE TO GET ONE FOR MY OLDER SISTER WHO IS DUE IN DECEMBER
THAT OUTFIT IS SO CRINGE WORTHY ANYONE WHO DESCRIBES THEMSELVES ARE NERDS AS SOME SORT OF PROCLAMATION IS BASICALLY JUST CODE FOR I'M A LOSER AND DIDN'T HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE
CONGRATS THIS IS EPIC
THAT'S AMAZING HE SHE WILL BE SUCH A LITTLE CHAMP IN THAT OUTFIT CONGRATS
THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WORDS IT IS BOTH TERRIFYING AND EXTREMELY EXCITING
SOMEONE PLEASE LINK THAT REALLY LONG GIF OF MARTIN REPEATEDLY FLIPPING OFF THE CAMERA DURING FILMING
IS THAT HIS THING
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THE WHOLE TRILOGY IS ONE BIG MIDDLE FINGER
NICE REMINDS ME OF THIS HETP
WELL COLOR ME IMPRESSED
EVERY TIME I SEE THE AIDS OF MARTIN FREEMAN FLIPPING OFF THE CAMERA ON THE BEHIND THE SCENES FOOTAGE HE SEEMS GENUINELY FRUSTRATED TO ME LIKE HE KNOWS THAT HIS EXPERIENCE IN FILMING THE HOBBIT IS NOT THE MAGICAL JOURNEY LOAR WAS JUST AS THE HOBBIT TRILOGY PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE LOAR TRILOGY TO SAY THE LEAST KINDA BUMS ME OUT
WHAT THE BOCK IS EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT

NO IN THE APPENDICES IT SAYS THAT DURING VII THE LAST MORIA BEFORE THE DWARVES DIED OUT SO THE DWARVES WERE AT LEAST CRAFTY ENOUGH TO GO BACK INTO DESPITE THE ENTRANCES ON BOTH SIDES BEING COMPROMISED AND DON'T FORGET IT WAS GANDALF THAT KILLED THE BARONG WHICH WAS THE MAIN DETERRENT FOR THE DWARVES IN THE APPENDICES BIT ABOUT FOLK IT'S HINTED AT THAT THE BARONG IS WHAT STOPS THEM FROM TAKING BACK MORIA THRAIN SON OF THORR SAYS HE WANTS TO RETAKE MORIA BUT DAIN IRONFOOT LOOKED INTO MORIA AND HE SAID IT WASN'T THE TIME THE BARONG I DON'T HAVE MY BOOK WITH APPENDICES HERE BUT I FEEL THAT GANDALF KILLING THE BARONG WAS A PIVOTAL EVENT FOR MORIA
THE DAM ON THE WEST SIDE COULD BE REMOVED THE WATCHER GOTTEN RID OF AND THE DOOR CLEARED ALTHOUGH POSSIBLY NEVER REPAIRED TO HAVE THE OLD FUNCTIONALITY THE FELLOWSHIP COULDN'T TURN BACK AS THEY HAD NO MEANS OF CLEARING THE DOOR AT THE TIME BUT THE ENTRANCE ISN'T LOST FOREVER

THE BRIDGE IS A TOUGHER SITUATION ASSUMING THAT IT'S DEFENDED AT ALL BUT IF IT ISN'T IT'S LIKEWISE NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A TEMPORARY BRIDGE IN PLACE
THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER WAYS OF GETTING IN AND OUT OF MORIA SECRET WAYS
DWARVES ARE PRETTY GOOD AT DIGGING I'M SURE THEY COULD GET BACK IN
WEREN'T THERE MORIA ORCS IN THE GROUP THAT CAPTURED MERRY AND PIPPIN HOW DID THEY GET OUT WITH THE BRIDGE DESTROYED
TZOLKIN TALKS ABOUT THIS POSSIBLE REDEMPTION AT LENGTH IN LETTER IN IT HE DISCUSSES FAILURE AND HOW PITY FOR GOLLUM CAME TOO LATE FOR GOLLUM OTHERWISE A REDEEMED GOLLUM MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE RING AND CAST HIMSELF INTO THE FIRE WITH IT AS HE KNEW HE COULDN'T KEEP IT AND HE COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT AND AS A SACRIFICE FOR FRODO I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND SOME ACTUAL QUOTES IT IS A LENGTHY BIT

EDIT

LETTER STARTS WITH A FEW PARAGRAPHS ABOUT FAILURE AS IN HE FAILED TO CAST THE RING INTO THE FIRE BUT THEN IT GOES ON TO EXPLAIN THAT IT WAS NOT A MORAL FAILURE ON PART THEN IT GOES ON ABOUT MERCY FRIENDSHIP GANDALF AND SOME STUFF ABOUT BILBO THEN THE LETTER GETS TO SAM AND GOLLUM


SAM WAS COCKSURE AND DEEP DOWN A LITTLE CONCEITED BUT HIS CONCEIT HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED BY HIS DEVOTION TO FRODO HE DID NOT THINK OF HIMSELF AS HEROIC OR EVEN BRAVE EXCEPT IN HIS SERVICE AND LOYALTY TO HIS MASTER THAT HAD AN INGREDIENT PROBABLY INEVITABLE OF PRIDE AND POSSESSIVENESS IT IS DIFFICULT TO EXCLUDE IT FROM THE DEVOTION OF THOSE WHO PERFORM SUCH SERVICE IN ANY CASE IT PREVENTED HIM FROM FULLY UNDERSTAND THE MASTER THAT HE LOVED AND FROM FOLLOWING HIM IN HIS GRADUAL EDUCATION TO THE NOBILITY OF SERVICE TO THE UNLOVABLE AND OF PERCEPTION OF DAMAGED GOOD IN THE CORRUPT HE CLEARLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND MOTIVES OR DISTRESS IN THE INCIDENT OF THE FORBIDDEN POOL IF HE HAD UNDERSTOOD BETTER WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN FRODO AND GOLLUM THINGS MIGHT HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY IN THE END FOR ME PERHAPS THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENT IN THE TALE COMES IN II FOLIOS WHEN SAM FAILS TO NOTE THE COMPLETE CHANGE IN TONE AND ASPECT NOTHING NOTHING SAID GOLLUM SOFTLY NICE MASTER HIS REPENTANCE IS BLIGHTED AND ALL PITY IS IN A SENSE WASTED LAIR BECOME INEVITABLE

THIS IS DUE OF COURSE TO THE LOGIC OF THE STORY SAM COULD HARDLY HAVE ACTED DIFFERENTLY HE DID REACH THE POINT OF PITY AT LAST III BUT FOR THE GOOD OF GOLLUM TOO LATE IF HE HAD WHAT COULD THEN HAVE HAPPENED THE COURSE OF THE ENTRY INTO MORDOR AND THE STRUGGLE TO REACH MOUNT DOOM WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT AND SO WOULD THE ENDING THE INTEREST WOULD HAVE SHIFTED TO GOLLUM I THINK AND THE BATTLE THAT WOULD HAVE GONE ON BETWEEN HIS REPENTANCE AND HIS NEW LOVE ON ONE SIDE AND THE RING THOUGH THE LOVE WOULD HAVE STRENGTHENED DAILY IT COULD NOT HAVE WRESTED THE MASTERY FROM THE RING I THINK THAT IN SOME QUEER TWISTED AND PITIABLE WAY GOLLUM WOULD HAVE TRIED NOT MAYBE WITH CONSCIOUS DESIGN TO SATISFY BOTH CERTAINLY AT SOME POINT NOT LONG BEFORE THE END HE WOULD HAVE STOLEN THE RING OR TAKEN IT BY VIOLENCE AS HE DOES IN THE ACTUAL TALE BUT I THINK HE WOULD THEN HAVE SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR SAKE AND HAVE VOLUNTARILY CAST HIMSELF INTO THE FIERY ABYSS

I THINK THAT AN AFFECT OF HIS PARTIAL REGENERATION BY LOVE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CLEARER VISION WHEN HE CLAIMED THE RING HE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED THE EVIL OF SARON AND SUDDENLY REALISED THAT HE COULD NOT USE THE RING AND HAD NOT THE STRENGTH OR STATURE TO KEEP IT IN DESPITE THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP IT AND HURT SARON WAS TO DESTROY IT AND HIMSELF TOGETHER AND IN A FLASH HE MAY HAVE SEEN THAT THIS WOULD ALSO BE THE GREATEST SERVICE TO FRODO FRODO IN THE TALE ACTUALLY TAKES THE RING AND CLAIMS IT AND CERTAINLY HE TOO WOULD HAVE HAD A CLEAR VISION BUT HE WAS NOT GIVEN ANY TIME HE WAS IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED BY GOLLUM WHEN SARON WAS AWARE OF THE SEIZURE OF THE RING HIS ONLY HOPE WAS IN ITS POWER THAT THE CLAIMANT WOULD BE UNABLE TO RELINQUISH IT UNTIL SARON HAD TIME TO DEAL WITH HIM FRODO TOO WOULD THEN PROBABLY IF NOT ATTACKED HAVE HAD TO TAKE THE SAME WAY CAST HIMSELF WITH THE RING INTO THE ABYSS

THE LETTER THEN GOES ON ABOUT HOW THE RINGWRAITHS WERE SENT TO MOUNT DOOM AND THAT IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM FEATHERTOP IN THAT FRODO HAD NOW CLAIMED THE RING THERE ARE SOME AMBIGUOUS STATEMENTS THAT THE RINGWRAITHS MIGHT NOW BE UNABLE TO TAKE THE RING FROM FRODO IT GOES ON WITH HOW THE RINGWRAITHS WOULD TRY TO LURE HIM OUTSIDE OF THE SHAMMASH NAUR AND THEN DESTROY THE ENTRANCE MAKING VICTORY CERTAIN AFTER THAT IT SAYS THAT NO MORTALS COULD WITHHOLD THE RING FROM SARON IN HIS PRESENCE

AND AFTER THAT COMES THE SORT OF FAMOUS QUOTE ABOUT HOW SARON HAD A BODY IN CASE PEOPLE DIDN'T GET THAT FROM READING LOAR LETTER IS INCREDIBLY INTERESTING

EDIT 2 I REALISED I DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR BONUS QUESTION WITH MY THOUGHTS ON A GOOD GOLLUM BUT I THINK THE PROFESSOR'S ARE MORE PROBABLY MORE INTERESTING ANYWAY
APPENDIX B SAYS THAT GOLLUM NEARLY REPENTS WHEN HE SEES FRODO SLEEPING WHO KNOWS HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO REDEMPTION

I ALWAYS AGREED WITH REMARK ABOUT THERE BEING LITTLE HOPE FOR THAT FOR HIM NOW YET NOT NO HOPE THAT SCENE WITH SAM LOSING HIS TEMPER LIKE THAT AND JUMPING TO WHAT MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN THE WRONG CONCLUSION ANNOYED ME WHEN I FIRST READ THE BOOK AS A YR OLD AND ANNOYS ME IF I THINK OF IT EVEN MORE NOW AS A MIDDLE-AGED MANUAL AND YET IT'S ENTIRELY UNDERSTANDABLE OF COURSE WHY SAM WOULD AUTOMATICALLY THINK WHAT HE DID TO ME IT'S A PROFOUNDLY SAD THING THAT WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN LAST CHANCE AT REDEMPTION SLIPPED SO EASILY THROUGH HIS FINGERS RATHER LIKE THE RING ITSELF BEFORE HE REALLY COULD EVEN GRASP WHAT COULD OCCUR THE MOMENT SIMPLY VANISHED THE IDEA THAT IF HE HAD UNDERGONE REDEMPTION AND WOULD AFTERWARDS HAVE PERHAPS BEEN WILLING TO LEAP INTO THE FIRE OF HIS OWN WILL ISN'T ONE THAT'S EVER CROSSED MY MIND THAT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING THOUGHT AND I APPLAUD YOUR BEING ABLE TO REACH IT IT REALLY MAKES FOR QUITE A CONUNDRUM BEING THAT GOLLUM WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO HOBBITS WHO WE KNOW WERE ABLE TO RESIST THE WILL OF THE RING BETTER THAN THE OTHER RACES WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD HAVE JUST BARELY BEEN ABLE TO DO SO I HAVE TO ADMIT I'M AFRAID TO VOICE MY OWN OPINION AS TO THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
HAVE YOU READ THE HOBBIT AND LORD OF THE RINGS

IF SO YES

IF NOT I'D RECOMMEND READING THOSE BEFORE DIVING INTO THE SILMARILLION
PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE HAS ONE OF TWO OPINIONS ON THE SILMARILLION A GRAND MASTERPIECE THAT ADDS GREAT DEPTH TO THE MYTHOS OF MIDDLE EARTH OR A MEANDERING GRIND WITHOUT MUCH OF A POINT

DESPITE READING THE PRIMARY TZOLKIN NOVELS WELL OVER A DOZEN TIMES I'VE ONLY READ THE SILMARILLION ONCE AND PROBABLY WON'T TRY AGAIN TO ME IT WAS TIRING TO READ WITHOUT MUCH CONNECTING SOME OF THE STORIES AND LACKING A LOT OF THE CONTEXT THAT WAS REALLY NECESSARY FOR THEM TO BE INTERESTING IF YOU'RE ANNOYED BY ALL THE PARTS IN LOAR WHERE IT REFERENCES THINGS THAT AREN'T EXPLAINED YOU PROBABLY WON'T LIKE THE SILMARILLION EVEN THOUGH IT ACTUALLY EXPLAINS A FAIR NUMBER OF THOSE THINGS

THIS SUB IS NATURALLY VERY ORIENTED TO DIEHARD FANS SO YOU'LL MOSTLY HEAR THAT IT'S A BUT TO MOST OF THE CASUAL TZOLKIN FANS OUT THERE IT'S A BIT MUCH

THEN AGAIN DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE OF THE LOAR MYTHOS AND DON'T WANT TO JUST READ THE WIKI THE SILMARILLION IS THE PLACE TO DO IT
TWO SUGGESTIONS OF READING ORDERS FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF BOOKS FOLLOWS

IF YOU ARE READING IT JUST FOR FUN AND LOOKING FOR SOME ESSENTIAL AND SUPERFICIAL UNDERSTANDING YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THE BASIC ORDER AS FOLLOWS

THE HOBBIT
2 THE LORD OF THE RINGS
THE SILMARILLION
THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN

THIS ORDER REGARDS ALSO COMPLEXITY OF READING BEING THE EASIEST AND THE HARDEST ONES

IN A CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER YOU SHOULD CONSIDER READING

THE SILMARILLION
2 THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN
THE HOBBIT
THE LORD OF THE RINGS
UNFINISHED TALES

THERE ARE ALSO INTERMEDIATE ADVANCED AND EXPERT ORDERS OF READING I CAN POST THOSE LATER IF YOU OR SOMEBODY WANT TO
DEFINITELY IT'S MORE OF A NARRATIVE BUT IT'S A GREAT READ IMO VERY INTERESTING WORKS
IT CAN BE A BEAR TO GET THROUGH BUT IF YOU DO THE LOAR IS WAY MORE ENJOYABLE BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE A MUCH DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE HISTORY AND CULTURES OF MIDDLE EARTH
PERHAPS IF YOU'RE INTO IT I LIKE IT SO I'D GIVE THE THUMBS UP HOWEVER THERE SEEM TO BE MANY PEOPLE WHO EITHER DON'T LIKE IT READS LIKE THE BIBLE IS DENSE ETC OR WHO FORCE THEMSELVES TO READ IT BECAUSE IT'S TZOLKIN I DON'T HAVE ANY NUMBERS BUT IT SEEMS A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE NOT REALLY INTO IT IT'S GOOD STUFF IF YOU ASK ME
I WOULD SAY YES MOST DEFINITELY BUT I'D ALSO ADVISE THAT YOU READ IT AT LEAST TO BEGIN WITH RATHER MORE SLOWLY THAN YOU MIGHT BE USED TO READING THE STYLE TAKES A LITTLE TIME FOR MOST PEOPLE THOUGH YOU MAY BE DIFFERENT TO ADJUST TO AND AS WITH ALL BOOKS TRY YOUR BEST TO REALLY VISUALIZE WHAT YOU'RE READING WHILE YOU'RE READING IT I'VE FOUND THAT HELPS A LOT IN BRINGING TO THE FORE THE POWERFUL GRANDEUR OF THE STORY EVEN DUE TO ITS GREATER COMPLEXITY IF YOU HAVE TO DO A LITTLE BACKTRACKING I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT WAS WORTH IT THOUGH I GET THAT BREAKING UP THE FLOW LIKE THAT CAN GET DISCOURAGING BUT TRY TO PUSH PAST ALL THAT IN THE END I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT YOU'LL KNOW YOU'VE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING QUITE SPECIAL A LITERARY LABOR OF LOVE THAT HASN'T OFTEN BEEN SEEN IN THE MODERN AGE OR PROBABLY ANY OTHER EITHER

GOOD LUCK
ABSOLUTELY HOWEVER IT'S BEST TO APPROACH READING IT WITH A MORE ACADEMIC MINDSET AS IF YOU'RE STUDYING THE MATERIAL FOR A CLASS YOU'RE REALLY WANTING TO ACE IT'S NOT A BOOK TO BE READ LIGHTLY FOR MERE ENTERTAINMENT
YES IT OPENS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VIEW ON THE OTHER BOOKS OF TZOLKIN AND SINCE HE WORKED SO HARD ON THE SILMARILLION I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH A TRY
I REALLY LOVED THE CREATION MYTH I MEAN A WORLD MADE OUT OF MUSIC THAT IS JUST BEAUTIFUL
THE SILMARILLION IS BASICALLY AND READS LIKE THE BIBLE OF THE LOAR UNIVERSE I WOULD SUGGEST READING IT BUT BE PREPARED FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN LOAR AND THE HOBBIT
DISCLAIMER SILMARILLION IS NOT FUN IF THAT IS WHY YOU WANT TO READ IT I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST IT I READ IT AFTER I HAD READ HOBBIT AND LOAR THRICE BECAUSE I WANTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND LEGENDARIUM I HAD READ A LOT ABOUT TURIN HOR FINGOLFIN AND OTHERS AND JUST COULDN'T RESIST

HOWEVER THE BOOK IS FRUSTRATING IT'S MANY TIMES DENSER THAN THE AVERAGE FANTASY WORK YOU'LL HAVE TO KEEP GOING BACK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON ROUTINELY TURNING TO THE INTERNET TO HELP YOU THROUGH IT

THAT BEING SAID IT SHOULD BE READ BY ANYONE
I READ THE SILMARILLION BEFORE LOAR AND ENJOYED IT MORE THAN THE THREE BOOKS

IT IS BASICALLY A VERY BRIEF HISTORY OF ARDA UP UNTIL THE POINT OF SARON CREATING THE RINGS
NICE I LIKE IT IT WOULD MAKE A GOOD TATTOO
RAD AS HELL
LOOKS AMAZING I'D LOVE TO SEE A NOD TO THE GAP IN HIS SCALES ON HIS CHEST THOUGH
COULDN'T GET IT TO OPEN ON MOBILE GOT A DIRECT LINK
SMUG SELFIE
THOSE WINGS ARE PRACTICALLY AN EXTRA SET OF ARMS DRAGONS ARE TOO OP IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THOUGH I LIKE THAT ABOUT DRAGONS THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH
VERY NICE BRO DEFINITELY GAVE ME THE SMUG FEEL THE WHOLE SNEAKY GRIN AND ALL

LITTLE NOTE
IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT I THOUGHT SMUG ONLY HAD BACK LEGS AND THE WINGS ARE ALSO ITS ARMS

FUN FACT
ACTUALLY IF YOU WATCH THE HOBBIT MOVIE IN THE FIRST VERSIONS THAT CAME OUT THEY GAVE SMUG LEGS AND WINGS WHEN HE BUSTED THROUGH THE DOORS OF ERECTOR IN MOVIE IN THE LATER MOVIES THEY GAVE HIM ONLY BACK LEGS SO THERE WAS A DISCREPANCY THERE WHICH IS CORRECTED ON THE DVDS IF I'M CORRECT
THOUGHTS AT FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKED LIKE YOUR TITLE READ SMUG FART
VERY ART NOUVEAU I LIKE IT
THIS IS SUCH A GOOD DRAWING AMAZING ARTIST
AWESOME ADD I AM KING UNDER THE MOUNTAIN
THOUGHTS MY ONLY CRITICISM IS THAT VERTEBRATES INCLUDING DRAGONS USUALLY ONLY HAVE FOUR LIMBS NOT SIX
IF YOU'RE A READING PERSON READ THE HOBBIT THEN LOAR I RECOMMEND THIS

IF YOU AREN'T A READER THEN JUST READ THE HOBBIT AND THEN WATCH LOAR

IF YOU HATE BOOKS WATCH LOAR THEN THE HOBBIT
I SUGGEST READING THE BOOKS FIRST THE REASON IS THAT ONCE YOU WATCH THE MOVIES YOUR IMAGINATION WILL BE RESTRICTED TO WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED IN THE MOVIE AND WILL OVERRIDE YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THE TEXT IT WILL NOT NECESSARILY DEGRADE YOUR READING OF THE BOOK BUT IT WILL CHANGE YOUR EXPERIENCE

I WISH REALLY WISH I COULD READ THE BOOKS AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME LIKE I DID WHEN I WAS BEFORE I HAD SEEN THE MOVIES SO I ENVY YOU A LITTLE

PETER JACKSON TRULY HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE THING WITH THE MOVIES A BRILLIANT ADAPTION HOWEVER BOOK AND FILM ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MEDIUMS AND FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING YOUR OWN PURE IMAGINATIONS I ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE FIRST
READ THE HOBBIT THEN LORD OF THE RINGS WATCH LORD OF THE RINGS AFTER THE HOBBIT MOVIES ARE OPTIONAL
THE BOOKS THE LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIES ARE PRETTY GOOD BUT THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT VISUALIZING MIDDLE EARTH FOR YOURSELF FIRST BEFORE SEEING SOMEONE INTERPRETATION OF IT

THE HOBBIT MOVIES ARE GARBAGE THEY AREN'T WORTH WATCHING AT ALL
SURPRISE YOURSELF I'D JUST SAY THAT THEY ARE A BIT DIFFERENT WHICH YOU'LL SEE AFTER HAVING ENGAGED IN BOTH YOU DON'T NEED TO DO ONE OVER THE OTHER FIRST BUT THE BOOKS TAKE PRECEDENCE IN THE LORE
LORD OF THE RINGS CAME OUT IN I WAS ONLY AT THE TIME AND MY READING SKILLS WEREN'T THAT GREAT I ALSO DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXISTED UNTIL THE MOVIE THUS I WATCHED LOAR BEFORE READING THE BOOKS HOWEVER I READ THE HOBBIT BEFORE THOSE FILMS AND WAS GLAD I DID IT IS SUCH AN AMAZING BOOK STILL LOVED THE HOBBIT FILMS THOUGH VERY ENTERTAINING
I WATCHED THE MOVIES BEFORE I READ THE BOOKS IN FACT BEFORE I KNEW ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE FRANCHISE FROM THIS COLD VIEWING THE MOVIES LEFT ME UTTERLY BAFFLED I WAS UNABLE TO RETAIN CHARACTER NAMES AND IDENTITIES TO TELL THE DIFFERENT RACES APART FROM EACH OTHER ETC I'D SAY READ THE BOOKS FIRST THEN WATCH THE MOVIES AS A BRILLIANT ILLUSTRATION OF THE BOOKS
HONESTLY IT'S UP TO YOU I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT LOAR UNTIL FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING CAME OUT IN THEATRES I WATCHED IT LOVED IT THEN READ THE TRILOGY AND THE HOBBIT BEFORE TWO TOWERS CAME OUT IN THEATRES I LOVE BOTH THE BOOKS AND THE MOVIES I LIKE THE BOOKS SLIGHTLY MORE BUT THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THAT WATCHING THE MOVIE BEFORE THE BOOKS DIDN'T REALLY AFFECT HOW MUCH I ENJOYED LOAR AS A WHOLE I DON'T THINK THE ORDER REALLY MATTERS ALL THAT MUCH
FOR ME IT'S LIKE TAKING A MASTERPIECE OIL PAINTING AND DRAWING ON IT WITH CRAYOLA MARKER
WHEN YOU HANG FROM A THEN WE SHALL PEE
DONT KNOW IF THIS IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE BUT I JUST NOTICED THIS I LIKE THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY DONT NEED TO HIDE THE ELDEN RINGS SINCE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR POWER YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE AND TOO BUT THERE WASN'T SUCH A GOOD SHOT OF THOSE

ALSO THIS SUB SHOULD ALLOW THE REDDIN IMAGES ITS EASIER TO UPLOAD STRAIGHT TO REDDIN INSTEAD OF IMAGER
NICE FIND AS MANY TIMES AS I'VE WATCHED IT I'D NEVER NOTICED IT BEFORE
I'M NOT SURE IF I'M THE ODD ONE OUT HERE BUT I THINK IT'S KIND OF UNNECESSARY RIGHT NOW PETER JACKSON DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB BRINGING LOAR TO LIFE THE MOVIES MIGHT NOT HAVE CAPTURED EVERY LITTLE THING BUT I THINK YOU'D BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND SOMEONE THAT COULD DO AS GOOD A JOB AS HE DID I MIGHT JUST BE A SANDBOY BUT THOSE MOVIES ARE GOOD ENOUGH THAT ANY ATTEMPT BRINGING THE BOOKS TO FILM AGAIN MIGHT FALL SHORT OF THE BAR PETER JACKSON SET

THAT BEING SAID A FOR THE HOBBIT WOULD BE PRETTY COOL CAUSE THOSE MOVIES WERE REALLY REALLY TERRIBLE
I'D LIKE AN ANIMATION SERIES WITH THE QUALITY OF PRINCESS MONONOKE AND WITH TURNER MOHAN AND SOME OTHERS AS DESIGNERS
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL AND COULD HAVE TONS OF POTENTIAL BUT LIKE U SAID THERE JUST ISN'T THE NEED FOR IT RIGHT NOW MOST PEOPLE ARE MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH TRILOGY SO A MINI SERIES THIS SOON AFTER THE FACT WOULDN'T DRAW THE ATTENTION IT WOULD DESERVE AND NEED MAYBE IN ANOTHER YEARS
MAYBE NOT A LOAR SERIES

BUT A MIDDLE EARTH SERIES FOR SOME PEOPLE LOAR DID EVERYTHING RIGHT GAVE A DECENT SUMMARY IN LINE WITH THE BOOKS OTHERS WANT A LITTLE MORE AND THE EXTENDED CUTS ARE GREAT

I THINK A SERIES BASED IN THE 2ND AGE WOULD BE GREAT YOU WONT RUN INTO MANY OVERLAPPING CHARACTERS BUT STILL HAVE A SIMILAR CONFLICT YOU COULD HELP CREATE BACK STORY TO DIFFERENT THINGS SUCH AS THE DUNEDIN ETC

SAID IT BEFORE BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE BEST TO ANIMATE IT YOUR DEALING WITH IMMORTALS AND AGING AND TIME COMMITMENTS ARE HARD TO KEEP GOOD CONTINUATION
NOT A MINISERIES BUT I THINK THE NEXT THING MADE WOULD HAVE TO BE A TV SERIES FORMAT WHICH MANAGES TO BE AN ALMOST PERFECT ADAPTATION WITH HOUR LONG EPISODES FOR CHAPTERS ETC

IT WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE BUT I CANT SEE ANYTHING ELSE WORKING A MINISERIES WOULD BE LESS THAN SIX HOURS WHAT WE'D WANT IS A SERIES THE LENGTH OF SOMETHING CLOSER TO THE DURATION OF THE AUDIO BOOK WHILE PERHAPS INCLUDING SEVERAL CLOSELY RELATED PLOTS FROM THE APPENDICES
NOT A FAN OF THE BOOKS I SEE
WESLEY CAN GO TO HELL HE'S A FAKE AND HE HAS ONLY CONTEMPT FOR ALL OF US
FOAH IS USING DOCK ON STINGING NETTLES NOT AN INTERNATIONAL THING I DON'T KNOW WHY I ASSUMED IT WAS VERY INTERESTING LINK THOUGH
HAHA OH NO I'M SO USED TO STINGING NETTLES I NEVER MADE THE CONNECTION THAT THEY MIGHT LOOK A BIT LIKE MINT THAT'S A NEAT IDEA AN OLD WIVES TALES IS ALSO THAT YOU ALWAYS FIND DOCK LEAVES GROWING NEAR NETTLES A DEMONSTRATION THAT NATURE PROVIDES SOLUTIONS WITH ITS PROBLEMS
ALTHEAS IS USED BY STEEPING IT IN BOILING WATER AND MOST OF ITS POWER IS IN ITS FRAGRANCE WHICH SMELLS WHOLESOME AND PURE AND DRIVES AWAY THE BLACK BREATH OF THE NAGUAL ARAGON WASHES WOUND WITH THE ALTHEAS TEA HE DOESN'T RUB THE PLANT ON THE WOUND

I'M JUST BEING PEDANTIC IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT DOCK PLANT SERVED AS AN INSPIRATION DOES IT SMELL NICE
PLENTY OF PLANTS IN ENGLAND HAVE BEEN USED FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES CRUSHED OR STEEPED IN WATER SINCE MEDIAEVAL TIMES HYSSOP COMFREY CHAMOMILE BETONY AND SAGE HAVE ALL BEEN USED FAR MORE THAN THE HUMBLE DOCK LEAF
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME PLANTS BUT WE HAVE STINGING NETTLE IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND USUALLY THERE'S A PLANT CALLED HORSETAIL SOMEWHERE NEARBY THAT HELPS A BIT

THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE FOR NETTLE HAS A WHOLE LIST OF FOLK REMEDIES WHICH INCLUDES BOTH HORSETAIL AND DOCK
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN INCEPTIONED
DOCK IS ALSO A GREAT TREATMENT FOR THOSE PESKY MOGUL BLADE WOUNDS
YES IT EFFECTED A GREAT DEAL OF PEOPLE IT IS SAID THE ENEMIES OF CONDOR ALSO SUFFERED OR THEY MIGHT HAVE OVERWHELMED IT IN ITS WEAKNESS CONDOR AND THE HEIRS OF ANÁRION
IT DID HAVE AN IMPACT ON EASTERLING ALSO I AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT SPREAD AMONG THE SOUTHRONS HOWEVER NOT SURE ABOUT ORCS BUT POSSIBLY
ORCS ARE CORRUPTED ELVES AND ELVES ARE IMMUNE TO DISEASE PESTILENCE SO I'D ASSUME THEY WERE FINE HUMANS HAD NO SUCH LUCK I'M SURE
NO ONE I HOPE IT'S SUCH AN OBVIOUS MONEY GRAB
I HAVE EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THE BOSSET IN INDIVIDUAL BONESETS AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS WHAT ALL THAT COST ME THAT MEANS THAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE OUTSIDE BOX SEEMS RIDICULOUS
ABSOLUTELY NOT THIS FEELS LIKE SUCH A SLAP IN THE FACE TO ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN A LONG TIME FAN I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS HIT BELOW IN LESS THAN A YEAR
WHAT BOX SET
HE COMPLETELY RUINED THE HOBBIT FOR ME BUT FLOTER IS MY FAVOURITE EVER TRILOGY I'M SURE I READ SOMEWHERE THAT HE WON'T BE ALLOWED TO BRING THE SILMARILLION TO THE BIG SCREEN AS FAMILY WERE UNIMPRESSED WITH HIS HOBBIT ADAPTATION
SO I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE SHOT WHERE FRODO LOOKS DOWN THE ROAD IT'S WHAT I CALL A PUSH PULL ZOOM BUT IS ALSO CALLED A DOLLY ZOOM OR A HITCHCOCK ZOOM ACOST MANY OTHER NAMES IT INVOLVES ZOOMING IN ON THE SUBJECT AS THE CAMERA MOVES AWAY FROM THE SUBJECT OR VICE VERSA EFFECTIVELY KEEPING IT THE SAME SIZE PROPORTIONAL TO THE FIELD OF VIEW YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT IT ON WIKIPEDIA

WIKI
HOR ER BIDET ATT
THE WHOLE HIKE WAS AMAZING INCREDIBLE SCENERY
SOME OTHER PICTURES FROM THE HIKE CAN BE FOUND HERE

EDIT PUT THE IMAGES INTO ONE ALBUM INSTEAD OF TWO

SOMEHOW I PREFER THIS SHOT MORE THAN THE ONE IN THE FILM
KINDA LOOKS MORE LIKE THE LAND OF ROHAN TO ME
THESE PICTURES ARE MAGNIFICENT WE'RE THE PICTURES TAKEN RECENTLY
I ALWAYS THOUGHT NORWAY WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE VISUALLY INTERESTING PLACE TO FILM LOAR THOUGH IT WOULD BE A THOUSAND TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE PROBABLY
VAKKERT BIDET DOVREFJELL OGSÅ I THINK THAT MEANS ALSO LOOKS LIKE MIDDLE EARTH
WELL I CAN RECOMMEND A WEBSITE STORIES OF ARDA MOST OF THE BICS THERE STAY WITHIN CANON AND ARE PRETTY GOOD AND THERE'S A LOT TO CHOOSE FROM

AND HERE'S THE FANATIC REC PAGE FROM TV TROPES

PMWIKI FANFICRECS THELORDOFTHERINGS

WARNING BEWARE OF TV TROPES YOU WILL LOSE HOURS OF YOUR LIFE THERE
IT'S REALLY WAY MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
THIRD COMMENT NAILS IT
NUMBER

HE FOUGHT IN AND LOST MANY FRIENDS BUT HE WAS NOT BROKEN

I THINK YOUR GENERAL IDEA ARTISTS ARE OFTEN BROKEN IS NOT PARTICULARLY TRUE ALSO
TZOLKIN FOUGHT IN AND LOST A LOT OF FRIENDS AND SAW A LOT OF TERRIBLE STUFF AND THAT MADE HIM PRETTY FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND SOME OF THOSE SENTIMENTS CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN ECHOING THROUGH ARDA BUT IN THE HEMINGWAY SALINGER VAN GOGH SORT OF BROKEN ARTIST MOLD HE DEFINITELY DOES NOT FIT HE WAS AN INTELLIGENT MAN WITH A PASSION FOR LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE WHO TURNED THAT PASSION INTO AN ENTIRE WORLD
NOT ALL THOSE WHO WANDER ARE LOST
DEVOUT CATHOLIC FAITH KEPT HIM FROM THAT FROM ALL I'VE EVER READ ABOUT IT HOWEVER HE DID ADMIT TO BOUTS OF DEPRESSION IN ONE OR TWO OF HIS LETTERS CIRC BUT REAL DESPAIR NO I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT TRUE THE RING IS LARGELY ABOUT DEATH BY OWN ADMISSION AND YET LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END OF IT
PUBLIC DOMAIN NOT THAT I KNOW OF

TRY YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY I GET AUDIOBOOKS OUT OF MINE ALL THE TIME
I'M PERSONALLY A BIG FAN OF PHIL DRAGASH HE REALLY CREATED A MARVELLOUS AUDIOBOOK ON THE TRILOGY

CATEGORY PODCASTS LOAR
ANY LEGAL VERSION NUMBER LIBRARY AS MIKE SAYS WOULD BE YOUR BEST BET
THERE WERE ONLY APPROXIMATELY OF THESE SETS MADE SO I AM EXTREMELY EXCITED TO FINALLY HAVE FOUND ONE THIS IS SINDARIN TENGWAR AKA ELVISH FOR ANYONE THAT DOES NOT KNOW
WHEN IS THIS USEFUL DON'T GET ME WRONG I LOVE LOAR AND TZOLKIN IS A GENIUS BUT WHEN WOULD THIS HELP ANYONE
THESE LOOK FANTASTIC I SAW YOUR POST ON R MK YESTERDAY AND IT INSPIRED ME TO WASTE MOST OF TODAY LEARNING AIRTH WITH THE HOPE OF GETTING A AIRTH KEY CAP SET HAHA I DOUBT IT WOULD LOOK AS GOOD AS THIS TENGWAR SET THOUGH PROPS ON THE FIND MATE
IT'S A BIT HARD TO MAKE OUT BUT THE RED KEY ESCAPE I PRESUME SAYS DEDO MELLON A MANNO FROM THE INSCRIPTION OF THE DOORS OF AURIN RIGHT
WOW THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL DO YOU MIND SHARING WHERE YOU GOT IT IF IT WAS LIMITED EDITION DO YOU KNOW WHO ORIGINALLY MADE IT IF THEY WILL EVER BE RELEASING MORE
CAN YOU PLAY MINECRAFT ON THAT
AUTOMATED TRANSLATIONS NUMBER

I LIKE CONSULTING THIS SITE IF I'M LOOKING UP WORD ROOTS AND WHATNOT BUT I WOULDN'T COUNT ON THAT FOR GRAMMAR

BEST I CAN SUGGEST IS TO ASK OVER AT R SINDARIN
IF WE TRY TO FIND A FILM EXPLANATION I GUESS THERE ARE TWO TO CHOOSE FROM

HE GETS IT BACK AFTER THE BATTLE

2 IT ISN'T THE SAME AXE BUT A STYLE THAT IS COMMON IN THE BLUE MOUNTAINS OR ERECTOR OR BOTH
NOT THAT I KNOW OF SARUMANS REFERS TO THEM AS THE RODS OF THE FIVE WIZARDS IN HIS RANT AGAINST GANDALF JUST BEFORE GANDALF DESTROYS HIS STAFFORDSHIRE
GANDSTALF

I'M SORRY
A LITTLE OFF TOPIC BUT ABOUT GANDALFS STAFF HOW DOES HE GET IT BACK FROM SAUMON
I LOVE IT WHERE DID YOU GET IT
THEY ARE EXCELLENT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE STORY OF HOW THE WHOLE LEGENDARIUM TOOK SHAPE BUT THEY'RE NOT COHERENT STORIES BY ANY MEANS THINK OF THEM AS COLLECTIONS OF DRAFTS AND ESSAYS THAT WERE LYING AROUND AND CHRISTOPHER COLLECTED AND DECIDED TO PUBLISH
LIKE U TOFFEEKING SAID THEY ARE ENJOYABLE FOR WHAT THEY ARE BUT THEY AREN'T REALLY COHERENT NARRATIVES LIKE LOAR OR FILM

BOOKS FOCUS ON THE EARLIEST FORMS OF LEGENDARIUM AND SHOW THE EVOLUTION OF THE STORIES FOUND IN THE SILMARILLION

BOOKS FOCUS ON THE CREATION OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY

BOOKS AND FOCUS MORE ON LATER VERSIONS OF THE SILMARILLION STORIES

BOOK FOCUSES ON THE CREATION OF THE APPENDICES AT THE END OF THE LOAR TRILOGY


ALSO IF YOU HAVEN'T READ UNFINISHED TALES YET I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT IT CONTAINS SOME MORE DETAILED ACCOUNTS OF SOME OF THE STORIES FROM THE SILMARILLION AS WELL AS VARIOUS WRITINGS ABOUT THINGS THAT AREN'T REALLY ADDRESSED IN DETAIL ELSEWHERE

MAKES ME WANT TO WANDER
CAN YOU BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS ANYWHERE
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING BRAVO
VERY IMPRESSED

CAN'T WORK OUT WHETHER TO GET THE UK THE EUROPE OR THE WORLD ONE
THERE'S JACKSONVILLE BUT NOT ATLANTA SH

WHY ARE THERE MOUNTAINS IN THE MIDDLE OF AUSTRALIA
YAY YOU MENTIONED BORNEO
PROBABLY NOT
FIRST OF ALL SILMARILLION PLEASE DON'T ABUSE THE NAME OF SUCH A WONDERFUL BOOK LOL

SECONDLY PLEASE NUMBER WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE FIRST TWO AGES AND BEFORE THAT TIME HAS MANY GAPS OF TIME AND TOO LITTLE NARRATIVE MAYBE THE CHILDREN OF AURIN COULD BE MADE INTO A MOVIE BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD REALLY CAPTURE THE EMOTION ONE FEELS THROUGHOUT SP THE BOOK
YES BUT I'D PROBABLY DESTROY THE MOVIE THEATER AFTERWARDS
PROBLEM WITH THE SILMARILLION IS THAT IT WAS NOT WRITTEN AS A STORY IT DOESNT FLOW AND HOPS AROUND JERT USED IT MOSTLY AS A STORY BOARD FOR LOAR HIS SON REALLY PUT IT TOGETHER ENOUGH TO MAKE IT SORT OF READABLE AS A STAND ALONE STORY SO THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ACTUAL JERT MATERIAL THERE AND BASICALLY HAS TO BE WRITTEN WHICH WILL THEN OBVIOUSLY MAKE IT A NON JERT STORY
LOOK UP EPIC SAX GUY ON YOUTUBE THAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE MUSIC FROM THE GANDALF VIDEO I BELIEVE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
I DIDN'T SEE THE POST YOU ARE REFERRING TO HOWEVER I KNOW A POPULAR GANDALF DANCING VIDEO USES A SAXOPHONE SEGMENT OUT OF THIS VIDEO
I THINK ITS CALLED EUROPOP GANDALF
GANDALF LAUGHED GRIMLY YOU SEE ALREADY YOU TOO FRODO CANNOT EASILY LET IT GO NOR WILL TO DAMAGE IT AND I COULD NOT MAKE BY FORCE WHICH WOULD BREAK YOUR MIND

MOREOVER IF ELROD HAD TRIED TO FORCIBLY TAKE THE RING FROM ISILDUR IT WOULD HAVE CONSUMED BOTH OF THEM
THIS QUESTION COMES UP QUITE OFTEN IF YOU SEARCH FOR IT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TOPICS ALREADY HERE IS ONE

R LOAR COMMENTS
ISILDUR HAD A LEGITIMATE CLAIM TO THE RING ELROD COULD NOT HAVE RIGHTFULLY FORCED HIM TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT

AND EVEN ELROD COULD NOT HAVE FORESEEN EVENTS THREE THOUSAND YEARS INTO THE FUTURE
ELVES HAVE A RULE AGAINST TOUCHING THE ONE RING OBSERVE CAREFULLY DURING ALL THE MOVIE SCENES WHERE AN ELF HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TOUCH THE RING AND HE OR SHE WILL SHY AWAY FROM IT ELROD WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE TO TOUCH THE RING IN HIS TUSSLE WITH ISILDUR

GANDALF TOO DOES NOT EVER TOUCH THE ONE RING WITH HIS BARE HANDS
BECAUSE FORCING PEOPLE TO DO THINGS IS BAD THAT'S PART OF THE MORAL THEORY OF THE ENTIRE MYTHOS
TRY GETTING THE LETTERS OF JNR TZOLKIN OUT FROM THE LIBRARY AND LOOKING UP RING IN THE INDEX
THE ISSUE ISN'T INTEREST OR LACK THEREOF BUT RATHER THAT THE TZOLKIN ESTATE HOLDS THE RIGHTS AND WILL NOT SELL THEM IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT ANY ADAPTATION OF THE SILMARILLION WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE UNTIL IT ENTERS THE PUBLIC DOMAIN WHICH IS PROBABLY AT LEAST YEARS AWAY
PLEASE GOD NUMBER
IMPOSSIBLE

2 ENOUGH WITH THE NETFLIX
I PERSONALLY AM NOT INTERESTED IN A LIVE ACTION OR ANIMATED ADAPTATION OF THE SILMARILLION AT ALL BUT IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT I THINK OR WHAT PUBLIC IN GENERAL THINKS BECAUSE CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN WILL NEVER SELL THE RIGHTS AND WILL MOST CERTAINLY PICK A PERSON TO RUN TZOLKIN ESTATE WHO AGREES WITH HIM ON THIS ISSUE
IMO ON OF THE BEST ASPECTS OF THE SILMARILLION IS THAT AS YOU WITNESS THE EVENTS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND HOW THEY DEVELOP AND AFFECT EACH OTHER YOU INTERPRET IT IN YOUR OWN WAY THERE'S MUCH MORE INTERPRETATION DONE BY THE READER THAN IN THE HOBBIT OR THE LORD OF THE RINGS BECAUSE THERE'S MORE CONTENT AND IT'S LEFT TO MORE SELF INTERPRETATION IN A TV SHOW THAT FEELING OF INTERPRETATION WOULD BE LOST AND THAT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF ITS MAGIC THIS IS OF COURSE MY OPINION
IT IS UNLIKELY TO BE ADAPTED FOR BOTH STORYTELLING REASONS VERY DIVISIVE JAM PACKED STORY FOLLOWING A BUNCH OF LARGELY SELF SERVING ARROGANT IMMORTALS WRITTEN AS MORE OF A CREATION MYTH HISTORICAL CHRONICLE THAN STRAIGHT FORWARD STORY PACKED WITH RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND A VERY DARK EPIC TONE THAT WOULD NEED A MASSIVE BUDGET TO DO THINGS JUSTICE AND WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO ATTRACT THE FINANCING OF A STUDIO OR THE INTEREST OF MORE CASUAL VIEWERS THAT'S ASSUMING YOU COULD EVEN WIELD THE DENSE STORY INTO A SCRIPT THAT FANS ACTUALLY LIKED THERE'S SO LITTLE DIALOGUE AND CHARACTER INTERACTION ON A PERSONAL LEVEL ANY FILM WOULD BE MORE FAN FICTION THAN ADAPTION ANYWAY AND FOR THE LEGAL WHAT I'VE READ IS TRUE IT LITERALLY WON'T BE MADE INTO A FILM FOR DECADES

ACCORDING TO THIS ARTICLE THE COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS OF CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN AND THE TZOLKIN ESTATE ABOUT THE PREVIOUS FILMS WERE MORE COMPLICATED THAN MERE ISSUES WITH THE LOAR SCRIPTS LEGALLY A SILMARILLION FILM MIGHT NOT EVEN BE POSSIBLE

BOOKS

TZOLKIN HAS BECOME A MONSTER DEVOURED BY HIS OWN POPULARITY AND ABSORBED INTO THE ABSURDITY OF OUR TIME SAID CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN THE CHASM BETWEEN THE BEAUTY AND SERIOUSNESS OF THE WORK AND WHAT IT HAS BECOME HAS OVERWHELMED ME THE COMMERCIALIZATION HAS REDUCED THE AESTHETIC AND PHILOSOPHICAL IMPACT OF THE CREATION TO NOTHING THERE IS ONLY ONE SOLUTION FOR ME TO TURN MY HEAD AWAY

THEY EVISCERATED THE BOOK BY MAKING IT AN ACTION MOVIE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AGED TO AND IT SEEMS THAT THE HOBBIT WILL BE THE SAME KIND OF FILM

I WAS IN MY FATHER S OFFICE AT OXFORD HE CAME IN AND STARTED LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WITH GREAT ANXIETY THEN I REALIZED IN HORROR THAT IT WAS THE SILMARILLION AND I WAS TERRIFIED AT THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD DISCOVER WHAT I HAD DONE

CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN IS OF THE SILMARILLION UNDER COPYRIGHT LAW NOT SURE ABOUT THE OTHER BOOKS WHICH HE EDITED

CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN HOLDS THE AUTHORIAL COPYRIGHT ON THE SILMARILLION NOT J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN HARPER COLLINS HAS CONFIRMED WITH US THAT UNDER CURRENT COPYRIGHT LAWS THE COPYRIGHT WILL THEREFORE NOT EXPIRE UNTIL YEARS AFTER CHRISTOPHER S DEATH AND NOT IN WHEN THE COPYRIGHT ON THE WORKS OF J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN WILL EXPIRE UPDATED

WHICH MIGHT MEAN HE'D BE ABLE TO PUT IN A CLAUSE IN HIS WILL ASKING THAT THE RIGHTS TO THE SILMARILLION ETC ARE KEPT IN THE FAMILY AND NOT SOLD UNTIL HIS COPYRIGHT PASSES INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON COPYRIGHT LAW BUT EITHER WAY I THINK IT WILL BE A VERY LONG TIME BEFORE WE SEE ANY OF THE OTHER BOOKS BE ADAPTED INTO BLOCKBUSTERS FOR BOTH LEGAL AND MONETARY REASONS

AND LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM HE IS AN FORMER ANGLO SAXON SCHOLAR AND LECTURER AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY CHRISTOPHER WAS ALSO GIVEN COMPLETE CREATIVE CONTROL BY HIS FATHER IN HIS WILL TO

PUBLISH EDIT ALTER REWRITE OR COMPLETE ANY WORK OF MINE
WHICH MAY BE UNPUBLISHED AT MY DEATH OR TO DESTROY THE WHOLE
OR ANY PART OR PARTS OF ANY SUCH UNPUBLISHED WORKS AS HE
IN HIS ABSOLUTE DISCRETION MAY THINK FIT AND SUBJECT THERETO

HE ALSO WISELY URGES THE EXECUTORS TO KEEP HIS COPYRIGHTS IN THE FAMILY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE



SO I MASCULINE O HE'S SIMPLY CAUTIOUSLY PROTECTING HIS FATHER'S LITERARY INTERESTS IN THE WAY HE DEEMS MOST APPROPRIATE IF YOU LOOK AT TZOLKIN SENIOR'S COMMENTS REGARDING MOOTED ADAPTIONS AND DRAMA AS ART FORM AT LARGE I THINK IT'S FAIRLY LIKELY HIS VIEWPOINTS ARE IN LINE WITH HIS FATHERS

ALSO THIS OLD THREAD ON A TZOLKIN FORUM IS ENLIGHTENING GIVING AN APPARENT INSIGHT INTO HIS VIEWS ON THE FILMS EXTRACTS QUOTED BELOW



CT AND THE TZOLKIN ESTATE FAMILY GET NOTHING WHATSOEVER FROM VIDEO GAMES SOUNDTRACKS MERCHANDISE COLLECTIBLES ACTION FIGURES BOBBLEHEADS BURGER KING CUPS ETC ETC ETC THE ONLY RIGHTS TZOLKIN PERE RETAINED WAS TO THE BOOKS THEMSELVES AND A CERTAIN ROYALTY PAYMENT ON THE FILMS GROSS PROFITS WHICH APPARENTLY DOESN'T COUNT MERCHANDISING YES BOOK SALES HAVE INCREASED

TO THE MAIN POINT I AM IN AN AWKWARD POSITION HERE BECAUSE CT HAS SHARED WITH ME HIS OPINIONS OF PJ'S WORK NOT TH OF COURSE HIS CRITICISM IS PAGES AND PAGES LONG AND NOT COMPLIMENTARY AT ALL UNFORTUNATELY I SIMPLY CANNOT SHARE ANY OF THIS MATERIAL PUBLICLY ALL I CAN SAY IN VERY BROAD TERMS IS THAT CT FEELS THAT ALL THE THEMES THAT TO HIM MAKE THE LR IMPORTANT ARE COMPLETELY SUBMERGED IN THE MOVIE BEHIND FRENETIC MOTION CHASES FIGHTS AND SHRIEKING CHOIRS AND IN ONE MAJOR CASE POOR CASTING BUT HE ALSO HAS SOME VERY COGENT THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE ALTERATION OF CHARACTERS AND THE POOR RENDERING OF PARTICULAR SCENES STEMMING FROM PJ'S APPARENTLY POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BOOK I FIND COMMENTS A BIT AMUSING BECAUSE CT ACTUALLY DOES KNOW RATHER A LOT ABOUT CINEMA AND HIS SUGGESTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENTS ON WHAT P DID YES THAT'S A SEEMING OXYMORON AND THE REASON UNDERLYING THE LAWSUIT

I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT MATTERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ARRANGED TO FORESTALL THAT

IN ANY EVENT NO STUDIO WOULD EVER EVER EVER GIVE AN AUTHOR FINAL CUT AND MEAN IT LOOK AT THE WAY DISNEY SWINDLED P L TRAVERS ON A SIMILAR CONTRACT PROVISION OVER MARY POPPINS IT WOULD BE HONOURED AS SINCERELY AS PROFIT PERCENTAGE I EAST NOT AT ALL CT IN THIS IS NOT BEING SHORTSIGHTED HE'S BEING A REALIST

BESIDES I THINK YOU FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE POSITION TAKEN BY CT THAT NO ADEQUATE FILM ADAPTATION OF THE LR MUCH LESS THE SILMARILLION COULD BE MADE AND THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF BATTLES AND MONSTERS VS TECHNOLOGY IT SIMPLY DOESN'T TRANSLATE ITS ESSENCE TO FILM WELL AT ALL OR AT LEAST NOT A FILM WHICH COULD REMOTELY HOPE FOR SUFFICIENT BOX-OFFICE TO COVER ITS COSTS AND HOLLYWOOD VERY MUCH CARES ABOUT CASH OVER ARTICLE NO STUDIO IS EVER GOING TO MAKE A TZOLKIN MOVIE AS A LABOUR OF LOVE

ALL YOU'RE REALLY ARGUING NEAR AS I CAN TELL IS THAT CT SHOULD JUST SURRENDER TO THE COMMERCIAL PIMPING AND SELL OUT LIKE AUDREY SEUSS ON THE GROUNDS HE AND THE FAMILY CAN'T RESIST FOREVER WELL MAYBE THAT WILL IN FUTURE DECADES PROVE TO BE THE CASE BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN ONE SHOULDN'T NONETHELESS FIGHT THE LONG DEFEAT

AND THAT POINT IS EXPLICITLY OPINION

CHRISTOPHER DOESN'T CARE WHETHER BOOK SALES INCREASE HE REALLY DOESN'T HE WOULD RATHER ACCEPT THE SILMARILLION GOING OUT OF PRINT THAN SEE IT KEPT AFLOAT ON THE BACK OF MOVIES LIKE PJ'S YES HE SAID SO

IT IS WORTH NOTING THE TZOLKIN ESTATE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN AN ONGOING LAWSUIT WITH WARNER BROTHERS SO THEY ARE VERY UNLIKELY TO WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH THAT PARTICULAR STUDIO AGAIN



I CAME ACROSS THIS IN A ADJ REVIEW IT BEST SUMS UP MY THOUGHTS

I THINK ADAPTING ANY PORTION OF THE SILMARILLION WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE COMPLICATED AND CONTROVERSIAL THAN ADAPTING THE HOBBIT WAS THE BIBLICAL TONE OF MUCH OF THE WORK IS LIKELY UNTRANSLATABLE TO FILM AS IS THE SENSE OF NARRATIVE REMOVE AND THE VAST SWATHS OF TIME INVOLVED I THINK AN ADAPTATION OF THE SILMARILLION THAT IS TRUE TO THE SUPERLATIVE CREATIVE CORE OF THAT SPECIFIC TEXT WHILE ALSO IN KEEPING WITH TZOLKIN S BROADER VISION OF MIDDLE EARTH WOULD PROBABLY LOOK SOMETHING LIKE TERRENCE MALICK S THE TREE OF LIFE IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULD REQUIRE EXPERIMENTAL SHOOTING AND NARRATIVE TECHNIQUES AND WOULD BE PANNED BY MOST OF THOSE INCLINED TO ENJOY HOLLYWOOD S PRESENT TAKE ON THE EPIC SO MUCH OF WHAT SEEMS DRY AND FACTUAL ON THE PAGE WOULD NEED TO BE PRESENTED AS ETHEREAL AND IMPRESSIONISTIC ON THE SILVER SCREEN AND I DON T THINK TZOLKIN FANS WOULD HAVE THE PATIENCE FOR IT

TO THE EXTENT THE STORIES OF THE SILMARILLION ARE IN SITU A MYTHOLOGICAL HAZE THAT HANGS INVISIBLY OVER MIDDLE EARTH REIFIED IN SONG AND STATUE YES BUT NEVER TOUCHED IN THEIR ESSENCE EXCEPT IN THE WAKING AND SLEEPING VISIONS OF INDIVIDUAL DWARVES ELVES GOBLINS ORCS WIZARDS AND MEN YOU WOULDN T WANT TO FALSELY CRYSTALLIZE THEM INTO WHAT COULD EASILY LOOK LIKE A MIDDLE EARTH DOCUMENTARY SHALL WE TELL THE STORY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE WORLD AS THOUGH IT WERE THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR FIELDS REIMAGINE ALIENOR USING A SIMPLY MORE SUMPTUOUS VERSION OF THE EXISTING RIVENDELL SET CAN WE SPEAK OF THE BEINGS IN THE SILMARILLION LET ALONE PORTRAY THEM IN FILM AS JUST GRANDER VERSIONS OF THE HEROES OF THE FELLOWSHIP NO IF YOU RE GOING TO CAST A FILM ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH GODS GODLIKE CREATURES AND LEGENDARY PERSONAE YOU HAVE TO EMPLOY A VISUAL STYLE THAT ESTABLISHES THESE ENTITIES AND THE EVENTS THEY PRODUCE AND MOVE THROUGH AS BEING SOMEHOW BEYOND OUR IMMEDIATE UNDERSTANDING JACKSON WOULD LIKELY NOT BE THE APPROPRIATE DIRECTOR FOR SUCH A WORK AS TOO MANY EXPECTATIONS INCONGRUOUS WITH SUCH AN ADAPTATION ALREADY ATTACH EVEN NOW TO HIS PROJECTS WE WOULD NEED INSTEAD A DIRECTOR AND A SCREENWRITER WITH WHOM OUR EXPECTATIONS WOULD RUN MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT WE D CALL AN ART HOUSE FILM

SO I GUESS I D SAY THAT FAILING THOSE PREREQUISITES BEING MET I DON T THINK I D WANT TO SEE THE SILMARILLION ADAPTED AT ALL AND SO I CAN T PREDICT WHICH STORIES FROM THE BOOK I D MOST WANT TO SEE ADAPTED AS THE STYLE OF ADAPTATION I D CONSIDER MOST APPROPRIATE WOULD CONSTITUTE AN ARTISTIC VISION WELL BEYOND AT LEAST IN CINEMATIC TERMS MY PRESENT UNDERSTANDING OR MY ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE




NO THANKS I'M PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH JUST READING
I'M NOT AN EXPERT BUT I'D SECOND THE RECOMMENDATION FOR CHILDREN OF AURIN THE BOOK IS VERY GOOD AND IT'S NOT AS HARD A READ AS SOME OF OTHER WORKS

HI EVERY ONE MY SCENE IS FINISHED I M REALLY HAPPY TO BE PART OF THIS CONTEST LIGHTS CAMERA IMMERSION FROM SKETCHFAB AND I HAVE MADE A SCENE FROM MY FAVOURITE MOVIE IS THE LORD OF THE RINGS FOR THIS CONTEST I PREPARED ONE OF THE MOST EPIC AND FAMOUS SCENE THEREFORE MY FINAL ENTRY IS CALLED THE BRIDGE OF AND HERE I REPRESENT THE EPIC BATTLE OF GANDALF AGAINST THE BARONG OF MORIA I HAVE WORKED WITH A LOT OF EFFORT ON THIS SCENE I HOPE YOU LIKE THIS
PLEASE CHECK COMMENT AND SHARE IT THANK YOU

AEROSTATION
CG
THAT IS SO COOL
THIS IS AMAZING GREAT WORK
GREAT JOB
WHERE IS ALL THE FIRE AND SHADOW THAT IS A LARGE PART OF A BARONGS ESSENCE
I LOVE THIS AWESOME SCENE

THAT BARONG IS FANTASTIC AND WONDERFULLY DETAILED TOP NOTCH STUFF YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
I SEE THAT YOUR BOOKS ARE IN TURKISH WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT I ASSUME SHE READS ENGLISH TOO THOUGH

IF SO OR EVEN IF NOT YOU COULD GO MUCH MORE SUBTLE AS A TZOLKIN FAN I HAVE ALWAYS COVETED THIS EDITION OF THE HOBBIT IT'S JUST SO NICELY AND MINIMALLY DESIGNED TINY WEATHERBOUND GILT PAGE EDGES IT'S GORGEOUS JUST AS AN OBJECT A SIMPLE LITTLE GIFT WHICH IS ALSO TOTAL CLASSICAL I WISH THEY'D DO THE LOAR AND SILMARILLION LIKE THIS
SHE MIGHT LIKE THE LETTERS OF J ROYAL R TZOLKIN IT'S A INTERESTING BOOK THAT GIVES A LOT OF INSIGHT ON THOUGHT PROCESS WHILE HE WAS WRITING LOAR AND THE HOBBIT ALSO ANSWERS SOME LORE THAT ISN'T COVERED IN THE BOOKS
DON'T EVEN GET HIM STARTED ON THE HOBBIT THEN

HEY BILBO MEET MY COUSINS YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK IN TO THEIR OLD CRIB AND SNATCH THEIR STASH FOR THEM FROM THE BIG MONSTER WHO IS GUARDING IT OH AND I'LL ONLY BE GOING ABOUT HALFWAY
POUNDS OF COCAINE AS YOUR NECKLACE NOT EASY IF YOU SNORT IT THE CARTELS AND AARC WILL IMMEDIATELY KNOW YOUR LOCATION THE SMELL OF IT TEMPTS YOU TOO
WHAT TRIPE
IT'S NOT SAID BY ANYONE IN THE BOOK BUT THE QUOTE IS THERE IT'S THOUGHT BY IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL

IT WAS FIRST VIEW OF A BATTLE OF MEN AGAINST MEN AND HE DID NOT LIKE IT MUCH HE WAS GLAD THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE DEAD FACE HE WONDERED WHAT THE MAN'S NAME WAS AND WHERE HE CAME FROM AND IF HE WAS REALLY EVIL OF HEART OR WHAT LIES OR THREATS HAD LED HIM ON THE LONG MARCH FROM HIS HOME AND IF HE WOULD NOT REALLY RATHER HAVE STAYED THERE IN IN A FLASH OF THOUGHT WHICH WAS QUICKLY DRIVEN FROM HIS MIND

THE SENTIMENT WAS MOVED INTO A BIT OF DIALOGUE FOR FARAMIR IN THE MOVIE SINCE IT IS RATHER HARD TO EXPRESS AN INTERNAL MONOLOGUE IN FILM
LOVE THE REALISM THAT WAR HAS PSYCHOLOGICALLY THE ENEMY MEN AREN'T DEHUMANIZED THEY WERE KILLED BECAUSE THEY ALSO HAD THE SAME MINDSET AS THE KILLER IF I DON'T KILL HIM HE WILL KILL ME
THAT'S A MASSIVE AUDIENCE IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE SCREEN WAS LARGER
HOW WAS IT IS THE ORCHESTRA GOOD
I WAS THERE TO SEE THE FELLOWSHIP
WE'LL BE TRAVELLING AROUND EUROPE TO SEE ALL THREE FLORENCE IN JANUARY AND GERMANY SOMEWHERE IN SPRING GREAT WAY TO ENJOY THE MOVIES AGAIN
SAW THE RETURN OF THE KING YESTERDAY

THAT WAS AWESOME IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO SUCH A SHOW GO FOR IT WORTH EVERY PENNY
THE HOBBIT WAS RELEASED IN THE FIRST PART OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS WAS RELEASED IN THE LAST PART IN
DUDE HONESTLY JUST GOOGLE IT
SIGH
IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THREE VOLUMES IN AND
IN RODE THE LORD OF THE NAZGÛL A GREAT BLACK SHAPE AGAINST THE FIRES BEYOND HE LOOMED UP GROWN TO A VAST MENACE OF DESPAIR IN RODE THE LORD OF THE NAZGÛL UNDER THE ARCHWAY THAT NO ENEMY EVER YET HAD PASSED AND ALL FLED BEFORE HIS FACE

ALL SAVE ONE THERE WAITING SILENT AND STILL IN THE SPACE BEFORE THE GATE SAT GANDALF UPON SHADOWFAX SHADOWFAX WHO ALONE AMONG THE FREE HORSES OF THE EARTH ENDURED THE TERROR UNMOVING STEADFAST AS A GRAVEN IMAGE IN RATH DANEEN

YOU CANNOT ENTER HERE SAID GANDALF AND THE HUGE SHADOW HALTED GO BACK TO THE ABYSS PREPARED FOR YOU GO BACK FALL INTO THE NOTHINGNESS THAT AWAITS YOU AND YOUR MASTER GO

THE BLACK RIDER FLUNG BACK HIS HOOD AND BEHOLD HE HAD A KINGLY CROWN AND YET UPON NO HEAD VISIBLE WAS IT SET THE RED FIRES SHONE BETWEEN IT AND THE MANTLED SHOULDERS VAST AND DARK FROM A MOUTH UNSEEN THERE CAME A DEADLY LAUGHTER

OLD FOOL HE SAID OLD FOOL THIS IS MY HOUR DO YOU NOT KNOW DEATH WHEN YOU SEE IT DIE NOW AND CURSE IN VAIN AND WITH THAT HE LIFTED HIGH HIS SWORD AND FLAMES RAN DOWN THE BLADE

AND IN THAT VERY MOMENT AWAY BEHIND IN SOME COURTYARD OF THE CITY A COCK CROWED SHRILL AND CLEAR HE CROWED RECKING NOTHING OF WAR NOR OF WIZARDRY WELCOMING ONLY THE MORNING THAT IN THE SKY FAR ABOVE THE SHADOWS OF DEATH WAS COMING WITH THE DAWN

AND AS IF IN ANSWER THERE CAME FROM FAR AWAY ANOTHER NOTE HORNS HORNS HORNS IN DARK SIDES THEY DIMLY ECHOED GREAT HORNS OF THE NORTH WILDLY BLOWING

ROHAN HAD COME AT LAST
JUST STARTED A REREAD A FEW DAYS AGO AND SO FAR MY FAVORITE HAS BEEN GO NOT TO ELVES FOR COUNSEL FOR THEY WILL SAY BOTH NO AND YES
IF BY MY LIFE OR DEATH I CAN PROTECT YOU I WILL ARAGON
AUTHORITY IS NOT GIVEN TO YOU STEWARD OF CONDOR TO ORDER THE HOUR OF YOUR DEATH AND ONLY THE HEATHEN KINGS UNDER THE DOMINATION OF THE DARK POWER DID THUS SLAYING THEMSELVES IN PRIDE AND DESPAIR MURDERING THEIR KIN TO EASE THEIR OWN DEATH GANDALF
SO DO ALL WHO LIVE TO SEE SUCH TIMES BUT THAT IS NOT FOR THEM TO DECIDE ALL WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHAT TO DO WITH THE TIME THAT IS GIVEN US
A WIZARD IS NEVER LATE NOR IS HE EARLY HE ARRIVES PRECISELY WHEN HE MEANS TO GANDALF IN FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING FILM
THESE SCENES ACTUALLY JUST MAKE ME ANGRY NOW SEEING THE INTRO OF THE FELLOWSHIP FIGHT ON MOUNT DOOM ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENES OF ALL TIME AND THEN OVER YEARS LATER RELEASING SOMETHING SO MUCH WORSE IT TRULY MAKES ME SAD AND FURTHER PROVES GREAT CG SCENES ARE NOT DUE TO THE ADVANCE OF TECHNOLOGY BUT MADE BY A GREAT VISION
I LOVED PART I II OF THE HOBBIT SERIES BUT THIS ONE UGH JUST FELT LAZY THERE IS A SCENE WHERE A TROLL DIVES THROUGH THE WALL AND THEY USE THE EXACT SAME ANIMATION TWICE FELT RUSHED AND LAZY
HOLLYWOOD RUINED THE HOBBIT THERE WAS NO REASON WHY THIS SHOULD HAVE DRAGGED INTO MOVIES THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY FELT LIKE IT DID THE BOOK JUSTICE BUT CERTAINLY NOT THE HOBBIT
BEGUN THE CLONE WAR HAS
I'VE WATCHED BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES ONCE AND REFUSE TO WATCH IT AGAIN HAVING HOURS WORTH OF ACTION SEQUENCES LOOSELY STRUNG TOGETHER AND CALLING IT A PLOT IS A DISGRACE TO LOAR THE OVERDONE CGI MADE IT WORSE
WELL THAT'S WHY THE HOBBIT IS NOT AS GOOD AS LOAR TOO MUCH CGI I WANT THE OLD ORCS BACK

LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SCENE SCENE JUST LOOK HOW PERFECT IT IS I DON'T THINK THERE'S CGI IN THERE THAT'S WHY I LOVE THE ORCS URUK FROM LOAR

EVEN THIS ORC THE GUY WHO YELLS INSPECTION WAS BETTER THAN AGOG
DON'T REMIND ME HOW TERRIBLE THESE FILMS WERE THE AMOUNT OF CGI IS DISGUSTING
AH YES AN ELF MASTER NAMED FIFO DYAS PUT IN AN ORDER FOR A CLONE ARMY MANY YEARS AGO
I REMEMBER BEING INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED WITH THE MINES OF MORIA SCENE IN LOAR WHEN THE FELLOWSHIP IS SWARMED BY ORCS AND THERE'S SO MUCH ATTENTION TO DETAIL FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE ORCS LIKE THIS GUY HERE EVEN THE RIDERS OF ROHAN WERE IMPRESSIVE AS HELL THEY'RE ALMOST ALL WOMEN WITH FAKE BEARDS ON DUPLICATED IN A VERY UNNOTICEABLE WAY THE EYE CANDY WAS THE BEAUTIFUL OF NEW ZEALAND WHICH GAVE OFF A THIS IS A REAL PLACE VIBE THAT MADE YOU FEEL IMMERSED NOT AND 3D

THIS WHEN I SAW THIS SCENE I DIDN'T GET EVEN THE TINIEST CHILL THE BATTLES HAD NO IMPACT FOR ME THEY FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING A WORLD OF WARCRAFT EXPANSION PACK TRAILER
THEY ALSO COPY PASTED THE MUD SPLATTER ON THE DWARVES SHIELD WALL HETP THESE THINGS ARE EASY TO SEE WHEN PAUSING A MOVIE AND LOOKING FOR FLAWS BUT THE HOBBIT MOVIES WERE SO CGI SATURATED THAT IT ALMOST FELT LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING ANIMATION I GET THAT SHORTCUTS ARE MADE FOR BUDGETARY REASONS WITH SUCH HUGE PROJECTS BUT THESE SHORTCUTS WERE NOTICEABLE I'M GLAD I GOT TO SEE SMUG IN ACTION CONVERSING WITH BILBO BUT I TAKE AWAY NEXT TO NOTHING ELSE FROM THE HOBBIT TRILOGY

THE CGI FOR HELMS DEEP WAS AIDED BY IT TAKING PLACE AT NIGHT AND DURING THE RAIN BUT THE CUTS TO REAL ACTORS KEPT THE IMMERSION AND ADDED TO IT AS IT DID FOR THE OTHER LOAR MOVIES I ALSO THINK WE'VE GOTTEN SPOILED BY SPECIAL EFFECTS IN THE LAST YEARS WHERE LARGE BATTLE SEQUENCES DON'T WOW US THE SAME AS THEY USED TO

IT'S PROBABLY NOT AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT BUT I LIKEN LOAR THE HOBBIT TO THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS TRILOGY THE PREQUEL THE ORIGINALS ARE BELOVED WITH GREAT CHARACTERS CONCISE STORY HUMOR ACTION ETC THE PREQUEL SEQUELS ARE FLASHIER THAN THEY NEED TO BE TOO DEPENDENT ON NEW CGI THE WRITING IS WORSE STORY IS BLOATED LESS DEVELOPED CHARACTERS
CTRL C CTRL V
NEW EXPANSION PACK IS GOING TO BRING DIFFERENT ELF FACES AND SOME MORE NEW SIDE QUESTS IT'S PROBABLY GONNA FIX THE BUG WHERE A SHITTY CHARACTER CALLED ALFRED KEEPS GETTING IN THE WAY TOO
THE HOBBIT TRILOGY IS LIKE JEB PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN EVERY SCENE OF CONFLICT IS SO BORING BECAUSE YOU KNOW NONE OF THE CHARACTERS WILL DIE AFTER ATLEAST ONE DIDN'T IN THE FIRST MOVIE HOW LONG DID IT TAKE FOR BOOMIER TO DIE MINUTES AFTER LEAVING RIVENDELL MAYBE IF THEY KILLED FILI AND AILI IN THE FIRST MOVIE AT THE END WE COULD HAVE FELT SOME SENSE OF DANGER FROM THE ACTION SCENES
JUST REALLY POOR EVEN MORE PAINFUL THAT P PROVED WITH LOAR THAT HE CAN DO THESE SCENES SO BEAUTIFULLY WITH FAR INFERIOR CGI CAPABILITIES
I ENJOYED THIS FILM DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A DISLIKE FOR IT
I FUCKING HATE THE HOBBIT MOVIES
THE WAY I MESH THE DIFFERENT LOOK IN THE HOBBIT COMPARED TO LOAR IS THEY ARE DIFFERENT IN UNIVERSE AUTHORS TZOLKIN USED A FRAMING DEVICE THAT HE WAS TRANSLATING THE RED BOOK FOR NOVELS SO THAT'S HOW I RATIONALISE THE DIFFERENCES IN STYLE AND TONE

BILBO USES A DIFFERENT APPROACH HE IS MORE OF A NOVELIST THAN BROD WHO WRITERS MORE LIKE A HISTORIAN

THIS IS WHY HE ORCS IN LOAR AND THE HOBBIT ARE DIFFERENT WHY THE FIGHTING IN LOAR IS MORE REALISTIC ETC BILBO EMBELLISHES MORE

ITS SIMILAR TO THE FILM AND COMIC COMPARED TO THE S MOVIE SPARTANS THAT INSPIRES FRANK MILLER TO WRITE THE COMIC IS DAVID WENHAM CHARACTER RECOUNTING THE BATTLE TO PEOPLE NOT WHO WERE NOT THERE AND HE IS AS LEONIDAS SAID A GIFTED STORYTELLER SO IN HIS VERSION THE SOLDIERS OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE ARE MORE MONSTER THAN HUMAN I MEAN COME ON THE PERSIAN EXECUTIONER IS A MORBIDLY OBESE MAN WITH BLADES INSTEAD OF ARMS THEY SPARTANS ARE PERFECT EXAMPLES OF HUMAN MUSCLUTAR AND ARE SUPERNATURAL INDIVIDUAL FIGHTERS AS WELL AS GREAT AT FIGHTING IN THE PHALANX

MEANWHILE THE S MOVIE IS ONE OF THE MOST HISTORICALLY ACCURATE EPIC MOVIES EVER MADE THE SPARTANS WEAR FULL HOPLITE PANOPLY FIGHT IN THE CORRECT MANNER THE PERSIANS ARMY IS JUST MEN AND THEY ALSO ARE USING THE CORRECT WEAPONS ARMOR AND EQUIPMENT CHARIOTS BOWS WICKER SHIELDS THE FACT THAT THE SPARTANS WERE NOT ALONE ON THE LAST DAY IS SHOWN THE ONLY REALLY MADE UP THING IN THE S FILM IS HE ROMANTIC SUBPLOT BETWEEN THE ONE OF THE MEN AND THE KINGS NIECE

STILL THE HOBBIT MOVIES ARE WEAKER DUE TO LACK OF PREP BECAUSE OF DEL TORO LEAVING THERE IS ALSO STILL A LOT OF DEL TORO IN THE FILMS ESPECIAL UNEXPECTED JOURNEY THE GOBLINS OF GOBLIN TOWN ARE DIFFERENTLY MORE A DEL TORO DESIGN AESTETHIC
THE PROBLEM WITH THE HOBBIT FILMS IS THAT THE STUDIO DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT MAKING THESE FILMS A LABOR OF LOVE AND INSTEAD MADE THEM ALL ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE AND CRANKING THEM OUT WHEN THEY WANTED THEM THE STUDIO BUTCHERED A SHORTER NOVEL BY SPLITTING IT INTO FILMS ADDING IN SOME FAN FICTION FOR FILLER SO THEY COULD SELL DIFFERENT HOME RELEASE VERSIONS FOR THE FILMS BETWEEN THEATRICAL AND EXTENDED CUTS IT'S REALLY SHAMEFUL A FANTASTIC SINGLE FILM COULD HAVE BEEN MADE THAT WAS A TRUE ODE TO THE FANS OF THE LOAR TRILOGY WITH A HOUR EXTENDED CUT LATER ON SADLY WE WILL NEVER SEE SUCH A FILM I HATE REBOOTS BUT I WOULD GLADLY WELCOME A LIVE ACTION HOBBIT DONE RIGHT

LOAR FILMS DESPITE BEING MADE OVER A DECADE BEFORE THE FIRST HOBBIT FILM JUST LOOK SO MUCH BETTER IN LOAR CGI WAS USED APPROPRIATELY ADDING ON TO THINGS THAT ALREADY HAD SUBSTANCE IN THE HOBBIT THE CGI WAS THE SUBSTANCE PERFECT EXAMPLE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KURTZ AND AGOG KURTZ WAS A REAL PERSON IN MAKEUP AGOG LOOKED LIKE A VIDEO GAME CHARACTER AND I CRINGED EVERY TIME HE CAME ON SCREEN
WHY ARE THE FOREST ELVES SO MUCH SHORTER THAN THE HUMAN I THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT
CTRL C CTRL V
THE CGI DWARF ARMY AND DWARF KING I FORGET HIS NAME MADE ME WANT TO CRY
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE ATTACK MOOSE
YOU SAY ALL ELVES LOOK THE SAM TO YOU THAT S RACIST
ARE YOU SAYING ALL ELVES LOOK ALIKE
ON LOAN FROM A GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY
THE MAGIC OF THE FIRST MOVIES WAS CREATED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE PRETTY LOW BUDGET CONSIDERING THE SCALE OF THE PROJECT THIS MEANT THAT A LOT OF THE EXTRAS WERE AND A LOT WORK PUT INTO THE MOVIES WAS DONE BY VOLUNTEERS MEANING IT WAS CREATED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO JUST DID IT OUT OF SHEER LOVE FOR THE STORY PLUS THE ORIGINAL CAST WERE ALL UP AND COMERS STILL HUNGRY FOR SUCCESS IN THE ORIGINAL MOVIES A LOT OF THE ACTION SHOWN OWN SCREEN CONTAINED ONLY REAL PEOPLE PLUS A GOOD PORTION OF THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WAS HAND MADE WITH PASSION

I DON'T THINK THERE WILL EVER BE ANY FANTASY MOVIE EVEN REMOTELY AS GOOD AS ANY OF THE ORIGINAL LOAR MOVIES YES I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS BEFORE BUT YOU GUYS KNOW WHICH I MEAN

IMO ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT THE FIRST TRILOGY DID RIGHT THE SECOND ONE DID WRONG
IT'S SHITTY BUT THE MOVIES MADE A TON OF MONEY I'M SURE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WORKING ON THE PROJECT PROTESTED WHEN THEY SAW HOW BLOATED AND SHITTY THE TRILOGY WAS GOING TO BE BUT THREE MOVIES MAKES A LOT MORE MONEY THAN ONE OR TWO


I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY WENT FULL ATTACK OF THE CLONES FOR THAT MOVIE
I FIND IT HILARIOUS THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL THE HOBBIT BUNDLED UP WITH LOAR AS IF THEY BELONG ON THE SAME SHELF
SO DISAPPOINTING
CTRL C

CTRL V
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER ORDERING A CLONE ARMY
THE HOBBIT TRILOGY WAS A MISTAKE
THE TZOLKIN EDIT IS THE ONLY WAY TO WATCH THIS MESS OF A TRILOGY

GANDALF GALADRIEL AND ELROD VS SARON WAS PRETTY EPIC THOUGH
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE NOTICED BUT YOUR BRAIN DID
I JUST WISH SOMEBODY OFFICIAL WOULD EDIT EVERYTHING TOGETHER TO A TIGHT AND DECENT HOBBIT MOVIE MOST OF THE PARTS ARE THERE
THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A COMPANY SEEING DOLLAR SIGNS IN A PRODUCT AND TRYING TO EXPLOIT IT HAD THEY SHOW THE CARE ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND TIME THAT THEY DID IN THE FIRST SERIES WE WOULD HAVE ALL BEEN BETTER OFF AND IT MAY HAVE EVEN USHERED IN A NEWER GENERATION OF TZOLKIN FANS BUT NO THEY TOOK THE CHEAP ROAD SO MUCH OF THIS HURT MY HEART
AND AN ARMY OF SASS
THIS CAN'T BE WHAT IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE IN THE FINISHED VERSION OF THE MOVIE RIGHT NOT JUST THE CLONES BUT EVEN THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE SHOT LOOK AWFUL
WHAT MAKES ME FRUSTRATED IS THAT THE ELVES WERE ACTUALLY GETTING THEIR ASS KICKED THESE SOLDIERS WITH HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF COMBAT EXPERIENCE WERE GETTING SMASHED BY THE BALITA AND SOME ARMED GOAT CALVARY THE DWARVES HAVE FAR LESS EXPERIENCE THAN MOST OF THE ELVES

P PROBABLY MADE IT THIS WAY TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE DWARVES CONSIDERING HOW THE MAIN CAST WERE MAINLY DWARF CHARACTERS

REALISTICALLY THE ELVES STOPPED THE CALVARY AT EASE IF A THOUSAND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE DOESN'T HELP I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES
HIS SCENES IN THE FIRST HOBBIT WERE GREAT AS WELL AS HIS SCENE WITH SMUG

THEY ARE GOOD MOVIES FOR WHAT THEY ARE BUT I WISH THEY WERE MORE RESONATING
SHIT QUALITY OF THE VIDEO DOESN'T HELP MUCH THOUGH
I LOVED THE LOAR THE HOBBIT SERIES NEEDS A REDO BETWEEN THE CRAPPY CGI STUFF MINUS SMUG AND THE MADE UP ROMANCE AND THE MADE UP PLOTS
GETTING A HEADACHE SEEING THAT THIS IS LESS THAN HALFWAY THROUGH THE HOUR MOVIE
JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW SHITTY THESE MOVIES ARE FUCK YOU PETER JACKSON
WAIT WHY DOES BARD LOOK SO TALL HERE THRANDUIL MAKES SENSE SINCE HE'S RIDING ON A MOOSE IS BARD ON HORSEBACK OR IS IT JUST A CASE OF POOR CGI COMPOSITION
ITT I THINK THE HOBBIT MOVIES ARE BAD DAE HAVE THIS UNPOPULAR OPINION
IAN HOLM AS FRODO AND BILL NICHY AS IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL AMAZING
IF YOU HAVEN'T LISTENED TO THIS ADAPTATION YOU REALLY SHOULD VERY FAITHFUL AND VERY WELL ACTED SAM GOLLUM GANDALF AND ARAGON ARE PARTICULARLY MEMORABLE AND THERE'S SINGING AND POETRY
THE EASTERLING OR THE OF INGMAR THE HELMETS OF THE TOWER GUARD WERE ALRIGHT TOO MINAS TIGRISH
DEFINITELY THE MINAS TIGRISH TOWER GUARD HELMETS WITH THE SEAGULL WING DESIGNS SO COOL
THE HELMET IS PRETTY BADASS WITH ALL THE SPIKES AND STUFF

I DID THINK FRODO AND HELMETS WERE QUITE RIDICULOUS I KNOW THAT THEY NEEDED SOMETHING TO COVER THEIR FACES IN MORDOR BUT WHY WOULD THEY MAKE THE HELMETS WITH STUPID BEAK LIKE FEATURES
I LIKE THE HELMETS THAT THE WORE AS DEPICTED IN THE MOVIES THEY LOOK A BIT SILLY ADMITTEDLY AND MAYBE NOT THE MOST PRACTICAL EXCESSIVE MOUTH EXPOSURE LACK OF ANY NECK PROTECTION BUT THEY SUIT THEIR BRUTALIST AESTHETIC QUITE WELL I LOVE ISENGARD AND THE URUK AS A WHOLE AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE WELL-REPRESENTED IN FILMS MORESO THAN A FEW OTHER FACTIONS AT LEAST
THE HELM GAME IN THE MOVIES WAS ON POINT IF WE ARE BEING HONEST PRETTY MUCH EVERY HELMET LOOKED FITTING I MYSELF LIKE THE NOLUDAR ARMOR HELMET COMBO AS WELL AS THE HELMETS OF ISILDUR TOWER GUARD WAS GREAT TOO I THINK PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY CAN AGREE THAT THEY NAILED IT I DISLIKE THE ROHAN ROHIRRIM HELMETS AND THE CONDOR SWORDSMEN ONES BUT THATS MORE BECAUSE THOSE HELMETS ARE YOUR TYPICAL EVERYDAY HELMET NOTHING TOO FANCY OBVIOUSLY THEODENS HELMET IS PRETTY DAMN RAD TOO
TOWER GUARDS


ELENDILS HELM IS THE BEST
THE WITCHING HAS THE BEST HELMET AND THE ELF HELMETS LOOK COOL DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE ORC HELMETS
THIS IS AN AWESOME IDEA YOU SHOULD POST THE PICTURES WHEN YOU FINISH HERE ARE MY IDEAS I DON'T THINK THE PIECES SHOULD MIRROR EACH OTHER I THINK THAT YOU REALLY LIMIT YOURSELF BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT CHARACTERS TO CHOOSE FROM IT COULD ALSO BE A PAIN IN THE ASS TO GET THE PIECES TO MATCH I DO HOWEVER THINK THEY SHOULD BE LINKED SOMEHOW OR AT LEAST CHARACTERS OF EQUAL POWER SO NOT A WIZARD AND A HOBBIT FOR EXAMPLE ANYWAY HERE ARE SOME THOUGHTS IDEAS

BLACK
KING SARON
QUEEN I THINK SAURURAN MAKES MORE SENSE THAN THE WITCH KING
BISHOP THE WITCH KING IS GOOD AND MAYBE PAIR HIM WITH THE MOUTH OF SARON
KNIGHT RINGWRAITHS OR MAYBE SHELDON AND THE BARONG
ROOK IT HAS TO BE AND ORTHANT
PAWNS A COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT ORCS WOULD LOOK GOOD I ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT THE OTHER RINGWRAITHS IF YOU DIDN'T USE THEM AS KNIGHTS

WHITE
KING AS YOU SAID ARAGON IS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE
QUEEN ARWEN IS OK BUT I LIKE GALADRIEL TOO
BISHOP GANDALF MAKES SENSE AND I WOULD PAIR HIM WITH ELROD
KNIGHT THEOWMEN COULD BE HERE MAYBE COMER AND ELWYN
ROOK I THINK TREEBEARD IS A GREAT IDEA AND YOUR DESIGN SOUNDS AWESOME BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO I WOULD PAIR HIM WITH THE ONLY THING I CAN COME UP WITH WOULD BE BEHORN THE OTHER OPTION IS OBVIOUSLY MINAS TIGRISH AND HELMS DEEP WHICH WOULD LOOK GREAT AND WOULD PROBABLY BE MY FIRST CHOICE
PAWNS I AGREE THAT HOBBITS FEEL OUT OF PLACE HERE SO HOW ABOUT A LAST ALLIANCE THEME WITH ALTERNATING ELVES AND MEN OF CONDOR OF EACH

HOPE THIS HELPED A LITTLE
SAM NEEDS TO BE A KNIGHT ON THE WHITE SIDE HE DESERVES IT
I FELT LIKE FRODO WITH THE RING OUGHT TO BE THE KING IT WOULD BE AWESOME FOR THE BLACK FORCES TO BE GOING AFTER FRODO
PERSONALLY I WOULD MAKE ALL OF THE GOOD SIDE PAWNS ROHAN HORSEMEN WITH KING THEOWMEN AND COMER IN THE MIDDLE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE COMER LED THE CAVALRY ON HELMS DEEP AND THEOWMEN MINIS TIGRISH

ON THE OTHER SIDE I WOULD MAKE ALL OF THE BAD GUY PAWNS RINGWRAITH HORSEMEN OR WITHOUT HORSES SINCE THERE ARE EIGHT RINGWRAITHS THE WITCH KING THAT MAKE UP THE NAGUAL JUST MY IDEA
I WOULD SUGGEST USING GANDALF AS QUEEN ON THE WHITE SIDE TO MATCH WITH SAURURAN ON THE BLACK SIDE EITHER THAT OR HAVING BOTH THE WIZARDS AS BISHOPS WHATEVER YOU DO I REALLY THINK GANDALF AND SAURURAN SHOULD MIRROR EACH OTHER
HOW ABOUT FOR THE BLACK ROOK SHELDON AT THE TOP OF CRITH DUNGOL OR A BARONG AT THE TOP OF THE ENDLESS STAIR

LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR CARVED PIECES
I THINK FOR ROOKS FOR THE BLACK USE THE TWO TOWERS OF AND ORTHANT OR BARONGS THATD BE BAD ASS
FOR THE WHITE PAWNS GENERIC DWARVES OR ELVES
FOR THE BLACK PAWNS ORCS OR GALLIUMS
ALSO WHAT ABOUT THE RING BEING THE KING OF THE BLACK
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT KINDA IS
ALSO MAKE SURE YOU POST AN IMAGE WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED IT SOUNDS COOL
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU SAID ARAGON WAS AN OBVIOUS CHOICE FOR KING BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY FITS INTO THE STORY BUT I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD ALSO MAKE SENSE THEMATICALLY FOR FRODO TO BE THE KING I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT LET ME EXPLAIN IN CHESS THE KING IS A WEAK PEACE ITSELF BUT YOUR LOSE THE GAME IF HE IS DEFEATED THIS IS A VERY SIMILAR SITUATION TO FRODO IN THE LOAR ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD OPEN UP THE OPTION OF HAVING GANDALF AS THE QUEEN AS HIS PROTECTOR I THINK IT ALSO MAKES SENSE FOR GANDALF TO BE QUEEN AS HE IS THE MOST POWERFUL CHARACTER FOR GOOD
I THINK YOU SHOULD USE GIMLI AND PERGOLAS AS THE WHITE KNIGHTS SINCE THEY PLAY SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE WITH ARAGON IN THE MOVIES ALSO I LIKE THE IDEA OF GANDALF AS THE QUEEN BECAUSE HE IS A POWERFUL WIZARD AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE IN ANY DIRECTION AS FAR AS HE WANTS SAME WITH SAURURAN THE PAWNS ON WHITE SHOULD BE THEOWMEN AND EITHER ELWYN OR COMER IN THE MIDDLE WITH THE RIDERS OF ROHAN AROUND THEM ON BLACK THE PAWNS SHOULD BE AN GENERAL AND TROLL IN THE CENTER WITH ORC AROUND THEM THE BLACK ROOKS NEED TO BE BARAD DUR AND ORTHANT AND THE WHITE ROOKS COULD BE MINAS TIGRISH AND HELMS DEEP FOR THE WHITE BISHOPS I THINK ELROD AND GALADRIEL WOULD FIT
IN SUMMARY
WHITE
KING ARAGON
QUEEN GANDALF
BISHOP ELROD AND GALADRIEL COULD SWAP OUT FOR ARWEN IF YOU WANT TO KEEP HER IN
KNIGHT GIMLI AND PERGOLAS
ROOK MINAS TIGRISH AND HELMS DEEP
PAWNS THEOWMEN AND COMER OR ELWYN AND RIDERS OF ROHAN

BLACK
KING SARON
QUEEN SAURURAN
BISHOP WITCH KING AND MOUTH OF SARON
KNIGHT SHELDON AND BARONG
ROOK BARAD DUR AND ORTHANT
PAWNS GENERAL LIKE GLUCK AND A TROLL IN CENTER WITH ORCS AROUND

IN THE BOOK AND ELENDIL DIE IN THE ACT OF KILLING SARON ISILDUR CUTS RING FROM HAND AFTER HE'S DEAD
IN THE BOOKS THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THE EVENT BUT NOT WITH A VERY DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF HOW EXACTLY SARON WAS KILLED THERE IS ACCOUNT FROM THE COUNCIL OF ELROD

I WAS THE HERALD OF AND MARCHED WITH HIS HOST I WAS AT THE
BATTLE OF DAGORLAD BEFORE THE BLACK GATE OF MORDOR WHERE WE HAD THE MASTERY
FOR THE SPEAR OF AND THE SWORD OF ELENDIL ANGLOS AND GARSIL NONE
COULD WITHSTAND I BEHELD THE LAST COMBAT ON THE SLOPES OF ORODRUIN WHERE
DIED AND ELENDIL FELL AND GARSIL BROKE BENEATH HIM BUT SARON
HIMSELF WAS OVERTHROWN AND ISILDUR CUT THE RING FROM HIS HAND WITH THE HILTSHARD
OF HIS FATHER'S SWORD AND TOOK IT FOR HIS OWN

SO HERE IT SEEMS THAT ELENDIL AND KILLED SARON AND ISILDUR LATER CUT OFF THE RING PROBABLY JUST THE ONE FINGER GOLLUM SAYS THERE ARE FOUR FINGERS ON THE BLACK HAND IN THE BOOK SARON IS NOT AN EYE BUT HE HAS A BODY IT JUST SEEMS HE COULDN'T REGENERATE THAT ONE FINGER

THE VERSION IN THE SILMARILLION IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

THE RULING RING PASSED OUT OF THE KNOWLEDGE EVEN OF THE WISE IN THAT AGE YET IT WAS NOT UNMADE FOR ISILDUR
WOULD NOT SURRENDER IT TO ELROD AND CHURDAN WHO STOOD BY THEY COUNSELLED HIM TO CAST IT INTO THE FIRE OF ORODRUIN NIGH
AT HAND IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN FORGED SO THAT IT SHOULD PERISH AND THE POWER OF SARON BE FOR EVER DIMINISHED AND HE
SHOULD REMAIN ONLY AS A SHADOW OF MALICE IN THE WILDERNESS BUT ISILDUR REFUSED THIS COUNSEL SAYING THIS I WILL HAVE
AS FOR MY FATHER'S DEATH AND MY BROTHER'S WAS IT NOT I THAT DEALT THE ENEMY HIS DEATH-BLOW AND THE RING
THAT HE HELD SEEMED TO HIM EXCEEDINGLY FAIR TO LOOK ON AND HE WOULD NOT SUFFER IT TO BE DESTROYED

SO HERE ISILDUR CLAIMS HE DEALT THE DEATH BLOW IT IS POSSIBLE AND THIS IS JUST ME SPECULATING IT IS NEVER STATED OUTRIGHT THAT THAIS JUST AN EXCUSE GOLLUM MURDERED HIS FRIEND AND CLAIMED THE RING WAS HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT AND THAT THE MATRIARCH OF HIS HOBBIT CLAN POSSESSED MANY MAGIC RINGS BILBO AT FIRST CLAIMED HE WON IT IN A GAME OF RIDDLES AND WAS INSISTENT THAT HE WAS NOT A THIEF PERHAPS ISILDUR CAME UP WITH THE THIS I WILL HAVE
AS FOR MY FATHER'S DEATH AND MY BROTHER'S WAS IT NOT I THAT DEALT THE ENEMY HIS DEATH-BLOW AS AN EXCUSE TO KEEP THE RING THIS IS JUST MY SPECULATION THOUGH

I DO THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT TAKING THE RING FROM POSSIBLY WAS A BLOW TO HIM IN EARLIER EVENTS SARON DIED AND HIS DISEMBODIED SPIRIT STILL MANAGED TO CARRY THE RING BACK TO MORDOR

SO BASICALLY THE WAY IT IS DEPICTED IN THE MOVIE IS ARTISTIC LICENSE BECAUSE IT IS LEFT UP TO THE IMAGINATION OF THE READ IN THE BOOK BUT I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT AND ELENDIL MANAGED TO KILL SARON OR AT LEAST KNOCK HIM OUT AND ISILDUR THEN CUTS OFF THE RING BUT SARON REACHING OUT TO ISILDUR ISN'T MENTIONED ANYWHERE
IN THE BOOKS ISILDUR WRITES THAT HAND BURNED LIKE FIRE AND SO WAS DESTROYED SO UH MAYBE HE WAS TRYING TO CAST PIRAGUA ON HIM

THE REAL ANSWER IS IT'S JUST MOVIES BEING MOVIES IN THE BOOKS ISILDUR JUST WALKS UP AND CUTS THE FINGER FROM SARON AFTER POPS AND TAG TEAM HIM
THERE IS A DELETED SCENE WHERE SARON REACHES TOWARDS AND SIMPLY IGNITES HIM
IT LOOKS LIKE ERECTOR
SAURURAN EXPLAINS THINGS TO GANDALF LIKE THIS FROM THE COUNCIL OF ELROD

A NEW POWER IS RISING AGAINST IT THE OLD ALLIES AND POLICIES WILL NOT AVAIL US AT ALL THERE IS NO HOPE LEFT IN ELVES OR DYING NÚMENOR THIS THEN IS ONE CHOICE BEFORE YOU BEFORE US WE MAY JOIN WITH THAT POWER IT WOULD BE WISE GANDALF THERE IS HOPE THAT WAY ITS VICTORY IS AT HAND AND THERE WILL BE RICH REWARD FOR THOSE THAT AIDED IT AS THE POWER GROWS ITS PROVED FRIENDS WILL ALSO GROW AND THE WISE SUCH AS YOU AND I MAY WITH PATIENCE COME AT LAST TO DIRECT ITS COURSES TO CONTROL IT WE CAN BIDE OUR TIME WE CAN KEEP OUR THOUGHTS IN OUR HEARTS DEPLORING MAYBE EVILS DONE BY THE WAY BUT APPROVING THE HIGH AND ULTIMATE PURPOSE KNOWLEDGE RULE ORDER ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SO FAR STRIVEN IN VAIN TO ACCOMPLISH HINDERED RATHER THAN HELPED BY OUR WEAK OR IDLE FRIENDS THERE NEED NOT BE THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY REAL CHANGE IN OUR DESIGNS ONLY IN OUR MEANS
I THINK WHAT SAURURAN WANTED WAS TO FLOW WITH THE TIDE BEFRIEND SARON AND AFTER VICTORY IS ACHIEVED AND THE RINGS RETRIEVED BACK MASTER THE COUNCIL OF SARON AS SARON DID WITH AND BRING RULE ORDER IN A PROPER FASCIST WAY WITH DOMINION OVER ALL FREE SOULS OF MIDDLE EARTH
FOLLOW UP QUESTION WHY DOES SARON WANT TO ENSLAVE MIDDLE-EARTH IS IT JUST PLEASURABLE TO HIM TO CONTROL THINGS
REMOVED
IT'S SYMBOLISM THE RED STAR IN THE SOUTH REPRESENTS SARON WAR AND MOUNT DOOM

I COLLECT TZOLKIN BOOKS AND HAPPEN TO HAVE BOTH OF THESE SETS PERSONALLY I PREFER THE DELUXE SET BECAUSE I THINK THE BINDING AND PAPER QUALITY IS A LITTLE HIGHER BUT HONESTLY BOTH OF THESE ARE GREAT EDITIONS YOU WILL ENJOY WHICHEVER ONE YOU DECIDE ON

ALSO I'VE NEVER PERSONALLY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE PRINT SIZE IT'S SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN AVERAGE BUT NOT TREMENDOUSLY SO

AS FOR A BETTER SUBREDDIT R TOLKIENBOOKS IS INTENDED FOR EXACTLY THIS SORT OF QUESTION
I HAVE A FEW COPIES OF THE SECOND PRINTING HARDCOVER EDITIONS AND I'D RECOMMEND THOSE JUST FOR THE COOL FACTOR YOU CAN OCCASIONALLY FIND THEM FOR UNDER ON EBAY AND HERE'S A LINK FOR THEM SELLING ON AMAZON

ALAN LEE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TZOLKIN ILLUSTRATORS AND THERE IS A WONDERFUL SINGLE VOLUME LOAR TRILOGY WITH HIS ARTICLE HERE IS THE AMAZON LINK USED BOOKS STARTING FROM AROUND I OWN THIS COPY AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT

THE FINAL COPY OF THE LOAR BOOKS THAT I OWN IS THIS BEAUTIFUL SINGLE VOLUME THAT COMES IN A NICE SLIPCASE THESE GENERALLY RUN BETWEEN EXCELLENT EDITION

PERSONALLY I'D GO WITH THE ALAN LEE ONE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS AND THE LOW PRICE
I HAVE THE DELUXE BOX SET I LOVE IT FEELS OLD FASHIONED AND THEY ARE SMALL THOUGH
MY SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BUY TWO SETS

I'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL FOLIO EDITION THAT SITS ON THE SHELF THAT I PULL OUT TO CAREFULLY LOOK AT SOMETIMES AND A VERY CHEAP PAPERBACK EDITION 2 AT THE LOCAL THRIFT SHOP THAT I CAN READ WHILE CAMPING IN THE BATH LEND OUT TO PEOPLE
THIS IS MY FAVORITE COPY OF THE TRILOGY MY WIFE GOT IT FOR ME ALONG WITH A MATCHING VOLUME OF THE HOBBIT THE PAPER AND QUALITY IS EXQUISITE
I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE LEATHER POCKET EDITION SET THE TEXT IS CERTAINLY SMALL BUT I NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEM READING IT IT'S WORTH IT FOR THE DURABILITY AND PORTABILITY OF THIS SET HAPPY READING
IT'S GREAT THAT PEOPLE ARE BIG FANS OF CHARACTERS BUT WHEN THEY TRY TO BECOME THAT CHARACTER IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA
WHAT DID YOU LEARN
I DIDN'T MAKE IT BUT THIS IMAGER POST CONTAINS QUITE A LOT OF INFORMATION

A DAPSON
I HAVE BEEN ON BOTH THE DAY TOUR OF HOBBITON AND THE NIGHT TOUR AND IF YOU'RE THERE ON THE RIGHT DAY I HIGHLY SUGGEST THE NIGHT TOUR YOU GO ON A DAY TOUR HAVE A BANQUET DINNER AND THEN GO ON A NIGHT TOUR SO THE PRICE IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT THE FOOD WAS FANTASTIC AND THE NIGHT TOUR WENT ON THE PARTY FIELD WHEREAS THE STANDARD DAY TOUR DIDN'T

WETA WORKSHOP IS AWESOME TOO LOTS OF COOL THINGS TO BUY THERE SO SET A LIMIT BEFORE YOU GO

THERE'S HIKING TOURS OF MT RUAPEHU MT DOOM ELYN MAIL THIS IS SEASONAL THOUGH AS IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST SKI FIELDS IN NZ IN WINTER YOU CAN ALSO TAKE THE SKI LIFT UP DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER I WAS THERE IN WINTER SO I JUST DID THE SKI LIFT FROM TONGARIO AND THAT WAS PRETTY FUN IF YOU'RE SKIING ANYWAY IT'S WORTH IT

THE NATIONAL PARK THAT WAS RIVENDELL IS A LOVELY SPOT BUT IT IS JUST ANOTHER NZ FOREST REALLY IT WAS ONLY A HALF HOUR OUT OF MY WAY THOUGH

IT'S NOT A TOUR THING BUT WHEN I WAS THERE THERE WAS A FEW HUGE WETA WORKSHOP INSTALLATIONS AT THE AIRPORTS WHICH I WENT AND SAW THERE WAS A COOL SMUG ONE AT WELLINGTON AIRPORT

I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE SOUTH ISLAND OF NZ SO I CAN'T COMMENT THERE
PLENTY OF OPTIONS FOR TOURS CHECK OUT FOR FILMING LOCATIONS WHILE YOU ARE HERE MAKE SURE YOU COME AND VISIT US IN STORE AT CHRISTIES HETP WE WILL SHOUT YOU A COFFEE ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE OUR OVERSEAS FANS
PALMERSTON NORTH OR NEW PLYMOUTH AND RICHMOND NELSON
SOME BELIEVE IT'S BETTER TO RULE IN HELL THAN SERVE IN HEAVEN
YOU CAN KNOW THE TRUTH AND STILL BE DECEIVED I THINK EVIL RESISTS GOOD BC IT THINKS IT CAN WIN
MORGOTH AND SARON AREN'T GOING TO HEAVEN OR HELL WHEN THEY DIE BECAUSE DEATH LITERALLY ISN'T A THING FOR THEM AINU ARE IMMORTAL SPIRITS FROM THE TIMELESS HALLS OUTSIDE ARDA THEY'RE ALREADY RUNNING AROUND DOING THEIR THANG FOR ETERNITY ERU HAS YET TO LOCK THEM UP ANYWHERE APPEARS TO BE COOL WITH IT HE CAN ALWAYS THWART THEM AT KEY MOMENTS BY MAKING A GUY TRIP AND FALL IN A VOLCANO OR WHATEVER

REMEMBER THAT ALL THINGS DERIVE FROM ERU MORGOTH INCLUDED WHEN HE REBELLED AND CREATED HIS CLASHING MUSIC ERU COULD HAVE STARTED AGAIN BUT DIDN'T HE CRYSTALLISED THE MUSIC INTO ARDA FLAWS AND ALL BECAUSE IT WAS ALWAYS PART OF HIS PLAN TO FIND BEAUTY ALL THE GREATER IN OVERCOMING EVIL YOU CAN HAVE NO LIGHT WITHOUT DARKNESS
WELL IF YOU LOOK AT CHRISTIAN MYTHOLOGY LUCIFER SATAN DEVIL ALSO KNOWS GOD AND HOW ALL POWERFUL HE IS AND HE STILL TURNED HIS BACK ON HIM ALONG WITH OTHER ANGELS
WHY SERVE IN HEAVEN WHEN YOU CAN RULE ON EARTH KINDA SUMS IT UP TO ME
I'D SAY SOME PART OF MELIOR WANTED TO BE ERU HE SEARCHED FOR THE MEANS TO CREATE AS ERU DID HE HATED ANYTHING THAT DID NOT SPRING FROM HIMSELF

OTHERWISE THE LURE OF CONTROL OVER OBJECTS WAS THERE FOR THEM ALL TO EXERCISE SARON DID IT OVER THE WILLS OF MEN AND ORCS

THERE IS NO HEAVEN AND HELL IN ARDA
PRETTY SURE IT STARTED AS AN AFFRONT TO LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO POLICE THE WORLD HE CREATED MORGOTH WAS ANGRY HE WAS LASHING OUT AT HIS IDIOT FATHER ESSENTIALLY THERE WAS NO WIN THERE WAS NO RULE OVER ERU HE WANTED ERU TO INTERVENE
OK LONG LONG TIME AGO THE ELVES AWOKE IN THE EASTERN REGIONS OF MIDDLE-EARTH THEY WERE INVITED TO BLESSED REALM AMAN BY ANGELIC BEINGS CALLED ALAR ALAR IS PLURAL VALA IS SINGULAR MANY OF THE ELVES STARTED THEIR JOURNEY TO WEST TOWARDS AMAN THEY HAD TO CROSS THE OCEAN FROM MIDDLE-EARTH TO AMAN THERE THEY DWELT UNTIL FËANOR A MIGHTY ELDEN CRAFTSMAN MADE THE SILMARILS THREE BEAUTIFUL JEWELS

A FALLEN VALA IMAGINE LUCIFER STEALS THE JEWELS AND ESCAPES TO MIDDLE-EARTH FËANOR GATHERS HIS SONS AND ALL ELVES WHO WANT TO GO TO WAR TO RETRIEVE THE JEWELS FROM FALLEN VALA CALLED MELIOR OR MORGOTH THEY FOLLOW HIM TO MIDDLE-EARTH MANY WARS AND ADVENTURES HAPPEN FEW MARRIAGES HAPPEN BETWEEN ELVES AND MEN
FINALLY MORGOTH IS DEFEATED

I MENTIONED MARRIAGES BUT THE PROB IS THAT MEN ARE MORTAL AND ELVES AS IMMORTAL SO IT HAPPENS THAT IF AN ELF WANTS TO MARRY A MORTAL SHE MUST ABANDON HER IMMORTALITY AND CHOOSE THE FATE OF MEN DEATH

ELROD IS A DESCENDANT OF ONE OF THOSE MARRIAGES HE GOT TO CHOOSE ALSO AND HE CHOSE IMMORTALITY HIS CHILDREN HOWEVER MUST MAKE THEIR CHOICE HAD ARWEN CHOSEN IMMORTALITY SHE WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE SHIP AND SAILED TO AMAN BUT SHE CHOSE MORTALITY

AND IN THE BOOKS THE ACTUAL STORY THAT IS IT WAS QUITE CLEAR THAT ARWEN WILL CHOOSE MORTALITY ELROD SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF IT AND ALTHOUGH IT HURT HIM LIKE HELL HE HAD LOST HIS TWIN BROTHER TO THE FATE OF MEN HE DECIDED TO HELP ARAGON TO RISE TO THE THRONE SO THAT HE MIGHT WED ARWEN
SHE AND HER BRETHREN LIKE HER FATHER UNCLE AND GRANDPARENTS WERE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE THEIR DOOM ARWEN LIKE HER BROTHERS AND ALL OTHER WAS MORTAL THE CHOICE OF THE THREE SIBLINGS COULD BE DELAYED UNTIL THEIR FATHER LEFT MIDDLE-EARTH IF THEY STAYED THEY'D BE MORTAL IF THEY LEFT WITH ELROD THEY'D BE IMMORTAL ELVES ARWEN IS OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR BEING AN ELF BUT SHE NEVER WAS AN ELF IN THE END SHE CHOSE THE DOOM OF MEN TO LEAVE THE CIRCLES OF THE WORLD DEATH

TO THE CHILDREN OF ELROD A CHOICE WAS ALSO APPOINTED TO PASS WITH HIM FROM THE CIRCLES OF THE WORLD OR IF THEY REMAINED TO BECOME MORTAL AND DIE IN MIDDLE-EARTH THE NÚMENÓREAN KINGS

THAT SO LONG AS I ABIDE HERE SHE SHALL LIVE WITH THE YOUTH OF THE ELDAR ANSWERED ELROD AND WHEN I DEPART SHE SHALL GO WITH ME IF SHE SO CHOOSES THE CHOICE MUST SOON BE LAID ON YOUR CHILDREN TO PART EITHER WITH YOU OR WITH MIDDLE-EARTH THE TALE OF ARAGON AND ARWEN
THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME TATTOO I'VE WANTED FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT LOOKS GREAT
SWEET TATTOO I WAS ALSO THINKING OF GETTING THAT ONE BUT DECIDED ON A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DESIGN FOR MY FOREARM TATTOO YOURS LOOK PRETTY GOOD THOUGH SO MAYBE I CHOSE THE WRONG ONE
LOOKS GREAT I HAVE TWO LOAR TATTOOS ONE IS THE EVESTAR ON THE NAPE OF MY NECK AND THE OTHER IS THE QUOTE DON'T GO WHERE I CAN'T FOLLOW ON MY FOOT
BEAUTIFUL
NICE BRO I'VE GOT A VERY SIMILAR ONE IN THE SAME SPOT
THAT IS TIGHT
NO I HAVEN'T I GOT IT YEARS AGO AND JUST RECENTLY JOINED REDDIN SO IT NEVER EVEN CROSSED MY MIND LOL
THAT LOOKS AMAZING I WANT MY FIRST TATTOO TO BE THE TREE OF CONDOR ON MY SHOULDER OR SOMETHING SOMEDAY SOMEDAY GLAD IT TURNED OUT FOR YOU
IT LOOKS GREAT
THIS IS FRIGGING SWEET I'VE WANTED THE TREE AND STARS ON MY BICEP WAS THERE A PARTICULAR GRAPHIC YOU SUPPLIED AS A REFERENCE
PRETTY BARE FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE
BEAUTIFUL AND ELEGANT
LOOKS AMAZING
VERY NICE
LOOKS GREAT
BEAUTIFUL LOVE IT
LOOKS LOVELY WITH THE TEXT AROUND I HAVE JUST THE TREE AND STARS THIS LOOKS VERY MINIMAL AND NOT TOO BOLD TOO
I POSTED A PICTURE FROM THE THEATER LAST YEAR BUT I JUST GET SO EXCITED EVERY YEAR WHEN IT COMES AROUND THAT I HAD TO SHARE IT AGAIN SINCE WE GOT OUR TICKETS TODAY IT'S A BIT PRICEY BUT FOR HOURS OF THEATER TIME CONTINUOUS SERVICE AND SEVEN FULL MEALS I THINK ITS A GREAT EXPERIENCE THEY HAD GREAT FOOD LAST TIME AND IT SEEMS THEY ARE KEEPING THE SAME MENU

EDIT MENU PICTURE HETP
WHERE DO YOU LIVE
THAT SOUNDS AMAZING
WHICH THEATER DOES THIS
OH MY GOODNESS THIS PUTS AUSTIN ON A LIST OF PLACES I NOW NEED TO VISIT WHEN IS THE EVENT USUALLY
I CAN NEVER HAVE NICE THINGS LIKE THIS
I ASKED ON THE FACEBOOK PAGE TO THE DRAFTHOUSE IF THEY WERE DOING THE EXTENDED EDITIONS BUT MY COMMENT WAS DROWNED IN OTHER COMMENTS OF PEOPLE TAGGING THEIR FRIENDS DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
AHHHH I'M SO JEALOUS IS THIS IN AUSTIN
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE DECORATIVE EDITIONS OF WORKS SO MUCH CLASS IN THEM
I'M SURE I SHOULD KNOW THIS BUT WHO IS THE GUY HOLDING HIS SHIRT UP UNNECESSARILY HIGH
DANG IAN AND VIGO LOOK SO OLD
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO LIVE IN SOUTH AFRICA WOULD YOU OP
CANNOT
THIS IS JUST SO AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL ARE THERE ANY OTHER SONGS FROM TZOLKIN THAT HAVE BEEN SUNG LIKE THIS OTHER THAN THE SONGS IN THE HOBBIT
ANYONE ELSE GET THE SHORT HAIR ON NECK AND ARM STANDING UP FROM THIS
YES IT'S EXCELLENT THEY'VE ALSO DONE A FULL VERSION OF FAR OVER THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AND ONE WHERE THEY COMBINED THAT SONG WITH THIS ONE IT'S A SHAME THEY'VE NOT DONE A FULL VERSION OF SONG THOUGH
THAT SCENE IN THE HOBBIT STILL GIVES ME CHILLS ITS WITH OUT A DOUBT A TOP MOMENT IN ANY OF THE FILMS
PERSONALLY I PREFER COLLIN TAKE ON THE SONG BUT THIS ONE IS ALSO QUITE GOOD I'M ON MOBILE RIGHT NOW BUT I'LL LINK ADAPTATION WHEN I GET BACK HOME

EDIT HERE IT IS
THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH IS REALLY MOVING TO THINK THAT AURIN WAS THE FIRST DWARF

THE WORLD WAS YOUNG THE MOUNTAINS GREEN
NO STAIN YET ON THE MOON WAS SEEN
NO WORDS WERE LAID ON STREAM OR STONE
WHEN AURIN WOKE AND WALKED ALONE

IT REALLY MAKES ME SAD TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ONCE WAS

IN ELDER DAYS BEFORE THE FALL
OF MIGHTY KINGS IN NARGOTHROND
AND GONDOLIER WHO NOW BEYOND
THE WESTERN SEAS HAVE PASSED AWAY
THE WORLD WAS FAIR IN DAY
THIS SONG IS PERFECT HONESTLY AFTER LISTENING I JUST WANT TO CRY BECAUSE I REMEMBER MURIELLE FILI AND AILI
PLEASE GO POST THIS IS R TOLKIENMUSIC TOO
CHILLS
YEP THIS IS AN AWESOME ARRANGEMENT THIS GROUP ALSO DID A IN LATIN WHICH IS PRETTY COOL
IN MY EYE I SEE THE DWARVES SITTING AROUND A FIRE SMOKING THEIR PIPES AND SINGING THIS FOR BILBO THIS IS WONDERFUL THANKS FOR SHARING
TEARS ACTUALLY CAME TO MY EYES BEAUTIFUL
HOLY SHIT THIS JUST MADE ME WANT TO EVERYTHING IT'S AMAZING
THERE'S ALSO MISTY MOUNTAIN HOP WHICH IS A GREAT TAKE ON THE QUEST TO RETAKE THE LONELY MOUNTAIN
FOR ANY SKYRIN PLAYERS HERE THERE IS A MOD THAT REPLACES THE MAIN MENU MUSIC TO THIS SONG
SKYRIN MODS
I LOVE THIS
THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS I WISH THEY PUT MORE MUSIC LIKE THIS IN THE HOBBIT MOVIES INSTEAD OF RUSHING TO REUSE THE AWESOME LOAR TUNES THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THE RISK AND MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND I FEEL THAT WAS THE MAIN PROBLEM OF THOSE MOVIES NOT ONLY IN THE SOUND DEPARTMENT
THIS IS AMAZING I WISH THERE WE'RE OTHER SIMILAR SONGS JUST SO I COULD MAKE A PLAYLIST
ROB INGLIS ALSO SINGS IT GREAT THO ITS MORE JOLLY
REMINDME DAY
DOPE AF
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE I ENJOYED THAT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
BBC RADIO ADAPTATION
WELL I SUPPOSE THE S ONE BUT I STILL DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ANY GOOD IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THE ONLY COMPARISON PJ'S WAS A STEAMING PILE OF WORTHLESS DOG SHIT

EDIT I'M AN IDIOT I KNOW FULL WELL WHAT THE S VERSION IS BUT FOR SOME REASON WHEN I READ THIS POST I THOUGHT OP WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ADAPTATION NEVERMIND PJ'S IS FAR AND AWAY BETTER THAN THE S SHORT

ALSO FOR FUCKS SAKE YOU AREN'T BEING FUNNY OR CLEVER OP YOU'VE POSTED LIKE THREADS THAT ARE ALL OBVIOUSLY TROLLS ABOUT THE S HOBBIT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS JUST STOP
NEITHER I PREFER THE GRAPHIC NOVEL ADAPTATION

WIKI
NOT SURE WHEN IT WAS MADE BUT THIS WAS THE BEGGING OF A RUSSIAN HOBBIT CARTOON THAT GOT THE PLUG PULLED ON IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AMAZING

WATCH V NJORD
JUST TO CLARIFY I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS VERSION
IT REALLY ONLY SHOWS YOU THE POWER OF DOMINATION AND CONTROL NOT ANYTHING OR EVERYTHING YOU WANT
IT'S KINDA LIKE THE FROM THE STALKER GAME
DAMN THAT SOUNDS AWESOME BUT I LIVE IN PITTSBURGH SO THERE'S NO WAY HAHA
I USED TO OWN IT WAS IN A BOX THAT DIDN'T SURVIVE A RECENT MOVE AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT MORE THAN VANILLA RISK

IT CAN EITHER BE PLAYED IDENTICAL TO NORMAL RISK ON A MAP OF MIDDLE-EARTH OR YOU CAN INCLUDE A COUPLE OF NARRATIVE ADDITIONS LIKE UTILIZING ROLL MODIFIERS LIKE HEROES AND STRONGHOLDS OR TRACKING THE FELLOWSHIPS JOURNEY AND TRYING TO CONQUER EVERYBODY BEFORE IT GETS DESTROYED
YES I DO I HAVE THE ORIGINAL VERSION AND THE EXPANSION WHICH INCLUDES THE SOUTHERN REGIONS OF MIDDLE EARTH ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE YOU NOW GET THE WHOLE MAP WITH THE GAME THESE DAYS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE SUNK COUNTLESS HOURS INTO IT ALTHOUGH WE USUALLY PLAY FOR TOTAL MAP DOMINATION AND TAKE OUT THE RING FELLOWSHIP META GAME THERE ARE SOME IMBALANCES WITH SOME OF THE REGIONS AND THEIR STRONGHOLDS BUT I'LL LEAVE YOU TO FIND THEM OUT FOR YOURSELF WE HERDED OUT SO BAD PLAYING THIS GAME WE WOULD EVEN LISTEN TO THE FILM SOUNDTRACK WHILE PLAYING
ALSO CHECK OUT THE WAR OF THE RING A HUGE EPIC WAR GAME BETWEEN TWO PLAYERS THAT ALSO HAS ONE PLAYER TRYING TO SNEAK THROUGH TO MOUNT DOOM AS FELLOWSHIP

THE MORDOR PLAYER HAS MANY MANY MORE ARMIES BUT CAN LOSE INSTANTLY IF THE FELLOWSHIP MAKE IT TO MOUNT DOOM


I HAVE IT MY BROTHERS AND I PLAYED IT FOR YEARS LOTS OF SIBLING RIVALRY FROM THAT GAME

WHAT CAN MAN DO AGAINST SUCH RECKLESS HATE
I USED TO OWN IT I REALLY LIKED IT COMPARED WITH NORMAL RISK
ME AND MY FRIENDS TRIED PLAYING BUT WE ENDED UP JUST FIGHTING OVER THE RING AND MAKING SEGOL IMPRESSIONS
IT HAS SOME REALLY UNIQUE TWISTS ON RISK AS A WHOLE THE LEADER SYSTEM AND COMPLETING MISSIONS LEAD TO SOME FUN PLAY PLAYING WITH OR WITHOUT THE FELLOWSHIP MOVING IS ALSO A UNIQUE TWIST MY PARENTS HOUSE HAD A FIRE AND IT WAS DAMAGED OR I'D STILL PLAY IT

ITS A FUN AND ENTERTAINING GAME ESPECIALLY IF YOU AND THOSE YOU ARE PLAYING WITH ARE FANS OF THE FRANCHISE
I USED TO OWN IT BUT WE ONLY PLAYED IT ONCE IT IS FUN IF YOU LIKE RISK
IT'S GOOD THE MAP OF IT IS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS NORMALLY SEEN BUT IT WAS FUN
READ THE HOBBIT FIRST THEN LOAR THEN WATCH LOAR SKIP THE HOBBIT FILM AND READ THE SILMARILLION
AGREE WITH EVERYONE HERE

HOWEVER AFTER YOU READ THE HOBBIT AND LOAR AND WATCH LOAR DON'T JUST SKIP OUT ON THE HOBBIT MOVIES ENTIRELY WATCH THE FAN EDIT THAT WAS MADE BY MAPLE FILMS IT TAKES ALL THREE MOVIES AND CUTS OUT THE JUNK AND TURNS IT INTO ONE HOUR MOVIE IT REALLY TAKES IT UP A NOTCH AND IS REALLY WELL DONE YOU CAN WATCH IT FOR FREE ON THEIR WEBSITE

BTW I'M INCREDIBLY JEALOUS OF YOU I HAD ALREADY SEEN THE LOAR MOVIES BEFORE I READ THE BOOKS SO I DIDN'T GET TO BUILD THAT UNIVERSE FOR MYSELF
YEAH HOBBIT LOAR INCLUDING APPENDICES LOAR FILMS THEN IF YOU'RE ITCHING FOR MORE YOU CAN READ THE SILMARILLION AND CHILDREN OF AURIN

THE HOBBIT MOVIES ARE LESS THAN GREAT BUT WATCH THEM AFTER THE LOAR MOVIES IF YOU REALLY WANT

ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT FELLOWSHIP STARTS PRETTY SLOW AND THE FIRST HALF HAS LOTS OF SONGS AND STUFF THAT'S A BIT BORING ON A FIRST READING IT PICKS UP ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH
THE HOBBIT MOVIES ARE TERRIBLE AND YOU REALLY WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE LORD OF THE RINGS WITH YOUR OWN IMAGINATION BEFORE YOU VIEW SOMEONE CONCEPT OF IT I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY GO ON AND READ THE LORD OF THE RINGS AFTER THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND READING THE SILMARILLION

MY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE MOVIES WOULD BE TO ONLY WATCH LOAR AFTER YOU'VE READ THE BOOK AND TO NOT WATCH THE HOBBIT AT ALL
DEFINITELY READ THE HOBBIT THEN LOAR I'D RECOMMEND THE SILMARILLION EVENTUALLY BUT YOU'D BE GOOD TO WATCH THE LOAR MOVIES FIRST
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST READ THE HOBBIT FIRST THEN READ LORD OF THE RINGS KEEP IN MIND THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT DENSE AT TIMES I'M A PRETTY QUICK READER AND IT TAKES ME A WHILE TO WORK THROUGH WRITING AFTER THAT I WOULD SUGGEST FIRST READING THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN AS IT IS WRITTEN MUCH MORE IN THE STYLE OF LORD OF THE RINGS HOWEVER IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO THROUGH THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH TRY READING THE SILMARILLION FIRST BUT I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO BE A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT READ YOU CAN ALSO STOP THE SILMARILLION WHEN YOU GET TO THE CHAPTER OF TARIN TURAMBAR THEN READ THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN THEN CONTINUE WITH THE SILMARILLION AS OF TARIN TURAMBAR AND THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN TELL THE SAME STORY IN TERMS OF THE MOVIES I WOULD RECOMMEND WATCHING ALL THE LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIES FIRST AND THEN WATCHING ALL OF THE HOBBIT MOVIES

TL R
THE HOBBIT LORD OF THE RINGS THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN THE SILMARILLION OR THE HOBBIT THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE SILMARILLION THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN OR THE HOBBIT THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE SILMARILLION CHURCH I XX OF TARIN TURAMBAR THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN THE SILMARILLION CHURCH XXI END
THIS IS ART FROM THE LOAR LIVING CARD GAME GREAT GAME FANTASTIC ARTICLE
POOR FATTY ALWAYS FORGOTTEN NEVER LOVED
IS THAT CRICKHOLLOW
THE ARTIST
THANKS FOR POSTING I NEVER GOT TOO FAR INTO LATRO BUT I'D LOVE TO HEAR TAKE ON IT
THAT IS SOME EVOCATIVE ARTWORK
WOW LOOKS VERY BIBLICAL MORESO THAN MOST COVERS I'VE SEEN
I REMEMBER HAVING ONE OF THESE IN OUR CLASSROOM IN MIDDLE SCHOOL GOT SHIVERS EVERY TIME I LOOKED AT IT THIS VERY BOOK COVER FIRST GOT ME INTO LOAR AND MIDDLE EARTH
THE SO-CALLED KAAPUHEMMOPAINOS ROBED GUY EDITION THE SECOND FINNISH EDITION OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE FIRST OMNIBUS EDITION FIRST PUBLISHED
OK QUICK STORY I JUST LOOKED AT THIS PICTURE AND THOUGHT NO BIG DEAL I'VE SEEN IT HUNDREDS OF TIMES THEN I THOUGHT HANG ON I LIVE IN ENGLAND WHY HAVE I SEEN THIS HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND THEN I REMEMBERED THAT THIS EXACT VERSION HAD JUST BEEN LEFT SITTING ON THE TABLE IN THE COMMON AREA OF THE STUDENT ACCOMMODATION I LIVED IN IN THE NETHERLANDS IT WAS THERE ON THAT SAME TABLE FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR I LIVED THERE

SO NOW I KNOW THAT THE BOOK I SAW EVERY DAY ON THE WAY TO THE BATHROOM WAS FINNISH ALSO I KINDA WISH I'D STOLEN IT
I HAVE THIS SAME COVER BUT I'VE OPENED IT SO MANY TIMES THAT THE COVER IS NOT ATTACHED TO THE BOOK ANYMORE
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE SARON IT LOOKS MORE LIKE THE WITCH KING
WHEN WAS IT PUBLISHED
ARE YOU FINNISH
IT LOOKS LIKE HE FOUND SOME DOPE SKI GOGGLES ON SALE AND BUILT HIS OUTFIT AROUND THEM
DANK
A WIZARD COMES OUT PRECISELY WHEN HE NEEDS TO
AFFECTS
I DON'T THINK FACEBOOK USERS WILL BE SMART ENOUGH TO DECIPHER THE S TAG
THIS POST IS ACTUALLY SURPRISINGLY ADORABLE
YOUR A WIZARD ARRY
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TELL ME YOU BOUGHT IT
FOR ONLY TEN MONEY NICE
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE OF THESE THAT HAD THE TWO CHAPTERS OF THE DARKENING OF ALIENOR AND OF THE FLIGHT OF THE NOLUDAR I USED TO HAVE THE ALBUMS LONG AGO BUT THEY WERE DESTROYED IN A BASEMENT FLOOD I STILL HAVE THEM ON A COPIED TAPE THOUGH
I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE
THIS IS AMAZING HOLY MOLY FINDING THIS WOULD TURN ME INTO AN AUDIOPHILE IF ANYTHING COULD
MFG I WANT
LA GEM
I GOT THIS OUT OF THE LIBRARY WHEN I WAS ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN THREE TRIES AND I COULDN'T GET THROUGH IT

THE SILMARILLION THE BOOK TZOLKIN FANS PRETEND TO LIKE
I WAS HOPING IT WAS THE LEONARD NIMOY ALBUM HAHA
DELETED
NOT HAVING A SINGLE CHARACTER THAT ISN'T WHITE WOULD PROBABLY BE SEEN AS RACIST WE NEED A TOKEN BLACK PERSON TO BE INCLUSIVE AKA BLACK FARAMIR OR SOMETHING

YOUR QUESTION HAS AN OBVIOUS ANSWER

HOBBIT MOVIES GOT MADE VERY RECENTLY AND THEY WERE NO MORE DIVERSE THAN LORD OF THE RINGS

HOWEVER GIVEN THAT SAM IS DESCRIBED AS BROWN AND THE PEOPLE OF CONDOR ARE AT LEAST KIND OF MEDITERRANEAN COLOURED IT WOULD BE EASY TO INCLUDE PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RACES IF A DIRECTOR DESIRED PROBABLY NOT AFRICAN BUT DARK GREEK ITALIAN COLOURING WOULD MATCH THE BYZANTINE VIBE SURROUNDING CONDOR

AND AGAIN WHEN ELWYN WAS FORBIDDEN TO GO AND FIGHT I COULD IMAGINE A LOT OF WOMEN SAYING WOMEN ARE JUST AS CAPABLE AS MEN WHAT A BUNCH OF CHAUVINISTIC SEXIST MALES NOT LETTING A FEMALE DO WHAT SHE WANTS

BUT ELWYN DOES GO OUT AND FIGHT IN LOAR ITS A VERY FEMINIST MESSAGE AS IT STANDS SHE'S A BADASS SHIELD-MAIDEN WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY WHAT ABOUT ELWYN OVERCOMING THE SOMEWHAT SEXIST EXPECTATIONS THAT SHE STAY AS THE LORD OF ROHAN UNTIL EVERYONE GETS BACK IS SEXIST TO YOU

ELWYN ISN'T FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN ARAGON WON'T TAKE HER BECAUSE SHE HAS PROMISED TO STAY AND BE THE LEADER OF HER PEOPLE AT HOME WHILE THEOWMEN IS AWAY
I MEAN I DOUBT IT LOAR WAS A WORK WITH DEFINED CHARACTERS AND RACES LONG BEFORE IT WAS A MOVIE I DOUBT THAT WOULD BE COMPROMISED TO PLEASE PC CULTURE NEW FANTASIES ARE PROBABLY SUBJECT TO THAT KIND OF NON SENSE BUT NOT WELL ESTABLISHED ONES LIKE TZOLKIN
THE MOVIES WEREN'T MADE THAT LONG AGO CULTURE ISN'T SO DIFFERENT NOW THAN IT WAS WHEN FELLOWSHIP CAME TO THEATERS
PC
THE MAIN GUYS IN THE BOOK ARE CLEARLY INSPIRED BY EUROPEANS OR AT LEAST REPRESENTED AS SUCH JERT WAS WRITING AN ENGLISH FOR AN ENGLISH AUDIENCE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE CENTURY FARAMIR AND THE OTHER DÚNEDAIN ARE GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS PALE WITH GREY EYES IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IN THE PARTS OF MIDDLE-EARTH WE SEE IN THE LOAR STORY ARE POPULATED BY PEOPLE WHO LOOK EUROPEAN IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO RANDOMLY PUT IN TOKEN ETHNICITIES

AND THAT BIT WITH THE AND COLWYN ISN'T EXPLAINED VERY WELL IN THE MOVIE BUT IN THE BOOK THERE WAS A PROPHECY THAT THE WOULD NOT BE KILLED BY A MANUAL SO IN THE END HE GETS KILLED BY A WOMAN

ONE OF THE MAIN CHANGES I WOULD MAKE IS TO HAVE A MORE SERIOUS GIMLI AND TO REMOVE THE BITS WHERE SARON IS JUST A FLOATING EYE HE HAS A BODY IN THE BOOK
THIS POST IS SORT OF WORDED IN A WAY AS TO SUGGEST THAT THESE COMPLAINTS WOULD SOMEHOW BE NEW AS IF THE MOVIES WERE NOT CRITICIZED FOR BEING ENTIRELY WHITE SAVE FOR THE ORCS AND UNFORTUNATELY BARE OF FEMALE CHARACTERS BACK WHEN THEY CAME OUT THEY WERE PRETTY WIDELY IN THE PUBLICATIONS THAT ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT SUCH THINGS AT THE TIME NOWADAYS I SUPPOSE IT SEEMS LIKE THESE CRITICISMS ARE MORE COMMON BUT IN REALITY THEY'RE JUST EASIER TO FIND NOW THAT THE INTERNET IS SO WIDESPREAD
AS I RECALL THERE WERE A FEW COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE EVIL MEN OF ARAD AND CHUN LOOKING VAGUELY ASIAN AND AFRICAN BUT THEN AGAIN THAT'S A REASONABLE INTERPRETATION OF THE SOURCE MATERIAL
I THINK THERE'S A POSSIBLE READING THAT GRAMA HAD LEARNED SOME STUFF FROM SAURURAN RE SPEAKING AS A FORM OF MAGICAL PERSUASION

I PREFER TO THINK OF IT AS HIM JUST BEING PERSUASIVE NATURALLY THERE'S ALSO A PASSING REFERENCE TO SUBTLE POISONS AND CONVINCING A LEGITIMATELY OLD MAN THAT BEING OLD MEANT THAT HE WAS NO LONGER STRONG NOT A LARGE LEAP OF LOGIC

ALL GANDALF DID WAS WAKE HIM UP A BIT AND REMIND HIM OTHERWISE THERE'S A LITTLE MAGICAL SOMETHING GOING ON IN THAT SCENE BUT MY PREFERRED INTERPRETATION IS THAT GANDALF IS JUST ASSERTING HIS POSITION AS A MESSENGER MAKING THE KING LISTEN TO HIM WHEN HE TELLS HIM THAT HE IS NOT WEAK AND ALL IS NOT LOST
NO HE MANIPULATED THE KING INTO A FATALISM AND PASSIVITY
THANKS FOR THE REPLIES I DO THINK IT IS ODD THAT THE OTHER MEMBERS IN HOUSE ALLOWED HIM TO DECAY TO THE POINT THAT HE WAS WHEN THE PARTY ARRIVED HOW DID THEY NOT ADD UP THAT GRIMA HAD BEEN A CAUSE OF THIS
NOPE THAT'S JUST PETER JACKSON MOVIE NONSENSE
I STILL DREAM OF THE MIX OF MIDDLE EARTH A SKYRIN QUALITY OPEN WORLD GAME
I HAVE A VERY SIMILAR PIC AS MY DESKTOP WALLPAPER HETP

NOT SURE WHO THE ARTIST IS THOUGH
ARTIST MATTHEW RODGERS FROM U SOUTH A

YOU CAN FIND MORE ON HIM HERE HETP

SOFTWARE USED PHOTOSHOP
THIS IS A WONDERFUL PIECE OF COURSE I DO HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH IT HOWEVER IT SHOULD HAVE MORE LIGHT TO IT THERE NEEDS TO BE A GLOW ABOUT THE CITY IT IS A CORE PART OF THE WORLD
THE QUALITY OF THE TREES IN THIS PAINTING APPROACHES BOB OSSIAN LEVELS
THIS HAD BEEN MY BACKGROUND ON MY PC FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS JUST CHANGED IT YESTERDAY LOVE THIS KIND OF ME ARTICLE
I ALWAYS DREAM TO LIVE IN HERE
BEAR ISLAND KIND OF REMINDS ME OF THIS

WELL THEIR MAIN DWELLINGS ARE GENERALLY MOUNTAINS THE MISTY MOUNTAINS MORIA WHICH HAS GREAT CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE AS THE ANCESTRAL HOME OF FOLK SO CONQUERING MORIA WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE THEN THERE ARE THE GREY MOUNTAINS AND THE BLUE MOUNTAINS WHERE DWARVES LIVED BUT ALSO THE IRON HILLS AND AFTER THE WAR OF THE RING GIMLI TOOK SOME DWARVES AND SETTLED IN THE GLITTERING CAVES BEHIND DEEP GIMLI ALSO MAKES POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THE FORTRESS AT DEEP CALLED THE HORNBURG

GIMLI STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE BREASTWORK UPON THE WALL PERGOLAS SAT
ABOVE ON THE PARAPET FINGERING HIS BOW AND PEERING OUT INTO THE GLOOM

THIS IS MORE TO MY LIKING SAID THE DWARF STAMPING ON THE STONES
EVER MY HEART RISES AS WE DRAW NEAR THE MOUNTAINS THERE IS GOOD ROCK HERE
THIS COUNTRY HAS TOUGH BONES I FELT THEM IN MY FEET AS WE CAME UP FROM THE
DIKE GIVE ME A YEAR AND A HUNDRED OF MY KIN AND I WOULD MAKE THIS A PLACE
THAT ARMIES WOULD BREAK UPON LIKE WATER

GIMLI ALSO HAS SOME PRAISE FOR MINAS TIGRISH

TOGETHER THE ELF AND THE DWARF ENTERED MINAS TIGRISH AND FOLK THAT SAW
THEM PASS MARVELLED TO SEE SUCH COMPANIONS FOR PERGOLAS WAS FAIR OF FACE
BEYOND THE MEASURE OF MEN AND HE SANG AN IN A CLEAR VOICE AS HE
WALKED IN THE MORNING BUT GIMLI STALKED BESIDE HIM STROKING HIS BEARD AND
STARING ABOUT HIM

THERE IS SOME GOOD HERE HE SAID AS HE LOOKED AT THE WALLS
BUT ALSO SOME THAT IS LESS GOOD AND THE STREETS COULD BE BETTER CONTRIVED
WHEN ARAGON COMES INTO HIS OWN I SHALL OFFER HIM THE SERVICE OF STONEWRIGHTS
OF THE MOUNTAIN AND WE WILL MAKE THIS A TOWN TO BE PROUD OF

THEY NEED MORE GARDENS SAID PERGOLAS THE HOUSES ARE DEAD AND THERE
IS TOO LITTLE HERE THAT GROWS AND IS GLAD IF ARAGON COMES INTO HIS OWN THE
PEOPLE OF THE WOOD SHALL BRING HIM BIRDS THAT SING AND TREES THAT DO NOT DIE

THERE ARE ALSO QUITE A FEW TRAVELING DWARVES IT IS SAID THAT DWARVES SOMETIMES TRAVELED THROUGH THE SHIRE DURING WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE STAYED IN NORMAL INNS AS THERE ARE NO MOUNTAINS IN THE SHIRE THERE ARE ALSO DWARVES STAYING AT THE PRANCING PONY IN BREE WHEN FRODO ARRIVES THERE

ALSO SOME ELVES LIVE IN CAVES OR STONE BUILDINGS DWARVES WERE EMPLOYED BY ELVES IN THE FIRST AGE TO CREATE NARGOTHROND AND MENEGROTH BOTH ARE THE HALLS OF THE THRANDUIL IN NORTHERN KIRKWOOD ARE ALSO CAVES POSSIBLY SIMILAR TO MENEGROTH IN DORIATH WHERE FATHER CAME FROM DON'T GO LOOKING FOR NARGOTHROND OR MENEGROTH THOUGH THEY WERE DESTROYED DURING THE FIRST AGE

I THINK THE MOST THING TO DO IS TRY TO REMAIN ALLIES WITH DALE AND HAVE RETAKING MORIA AS THE MAIN GOAL THEY ALSO HAD A HUGE WAR AGAINST THE ORCS SO TAKING OUT ORC FACTIONS MIGHT ALSO BE A REASONABLE GOAL FROM THE WAY IT READS IN THE APPENDICES OF LOAR IT WAS MORE OR LESS A GENOCIDE AGAINST ORCS BECAUSE ONE OF THEM KILLED THORR SO DON'T HESITATE TO GO ALL OUT ON A FACTION THAT ATTACKS YOU GUNDABAD IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL AURIN AWOKE THERE BEFORE HE SETTLED IN MORIA

THE ROAD THAT I SPEAK OF LEADS TO THE MINES OF MORIA SAID GANDALF
ONLY GIMLI LIFTED UP HIS HEAD A SMOULDERING FIRE WAS IN HIS EYES ON ALL THE
OTHERS A DREAD FELL AT THE MENTION OF THAT NAME EVEN TO THE HOBBITS IT WAS A
LEGEND OF VAGUE FEAR

IT'S A LONG TIME AGO SINCE I PLAYED THIRD AGE TW BUT I THINK YOU MAY BE ABLE TO RECRUIT SOME SPECIAL UNIT FROM MORIA
ALL DWARF KINGDOMS MENTIONED BY TZOLKIN ARE LOCATED IN MOUNTAINS OR HILLS THERE WERE DWARVES STAYING IN BREE WHEN FRODO AND COMPANY PASSED THROUGH BUT THEY WERE NOT LIVING THERE THEY WERE MERELY STAYING AT THE INN ON THEIR JOURNEY WESTERN
THERE WAS ALMOST DEFINITELY A SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT TEMPORARY DAVEN POPULATION LIVING IN MINAS TIGRISH AND OTHER PARTS OF CONDOR FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE WAR OF THE RING PARTICIPATING IN THE REBUILDING THAT U REINERPERSOON MENTIONS MOST LIKELY MANY OF THEM BECAME THEN COLONISTS OF THE GLITTERING CAVES

EARLY 4TH AGE CONDOR WOULD BE VERY A INTERESTING PLACE DUE TO ARAGON BEING KING AND ARWEN BEING QUEEN THERE WOULD BE A LOT MORE COMPACT WITH DWARVES AND ELVES AND I AM NOT EVEN INCLUDING PERGOLAS ELDEN COLONY IN ITHILIEN
TAKE A TRIP TO NZ AND YOU CAN WATCH ALL OF THEM BACK TO BACK SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE
STORY TIME

SO MY WIFE AND I WERE FLYING A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY WAS ONE OF THE CHOICES SHE WAS HAVING TROUBLE HEARING THE AUDIO SO SHE WENT TO TURN ON THE SUBTITLES AND FOUND THAT FOR WHATEVER ODD REASON THE ONLY SUBTITLE LANGUAGE AVAILABLE WAS HEBREW WEIRD SINCE THIS WAS UNITED RATHER THAN EL AL BUT LUCKILY SHE SPEAKS HEBREW SO WHATEVER

ANYWAY IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE RUNNING FROM THE GOBLINS THROUGH THE CAVES AND SHE JUST STARTS CRACKING UP I ASK HER WHY AND SHE EXPLAINS

WHEN THERE IS SCREAMING AND YELLING IN MOVIES THEY CAN CAPTION IT ONE OF TWO WAYS EITHER SOMETHING LIKE

AAAAHHH

OR ELSE SOMETHING LIKE



KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WELL WHOEVER DID THE HEBREW CAPTIONING TOOK THE FORMER ROUTE WHICH MEANT THE DWARVES WERE FIGHTING THE GOBLINS SCREAMING THEIR BATTLE CRY OF OY OY OY OY
OH THAT'S NICE THEY HAVE THE EVOLUTION OF GOLF FOR THOSE THAT DON'T WANT TO WATCH A MOVIE AND JUST WANT TO FALL ASLEEP

THAT'S RATHER CONSIDERATE FOR AN AIRLINE
ON MY FLIGHT TO AUSTRALIA I WATCHED ALL TAKEN MOVIES IN A ROW I FELT IT WAS A GOOD USE OF MY TIME
YEAH BUT THEY ARE NOT THE EXTENDED EDITIONS
WHAT FLIGHT WAS THAT
IM FLYING TO ENGLAND NEXT MONTH WHAT AIRLINE DID YOU FLY
LORD OF THE RINGS RINGS RINGS
TURKISH AIRLINES HAS THESE MONITORS
I FLEW TO HONG KONG WITH A COLLEAGUE WHO IS NEVER ABLE TO SLEEP ON PLANES HE WATCHED THE HOBBIT

ALL THREE MOVIES BACK TO BACK
ITT EVERY OTHER AIRLINE BUT THE ONES I PICK HAVE AMAZING IN-FLIGHT MOVIES
HAHA YES ONE TIME I ALMOST GOT THROUGH ALL THREE OF THEM ON A FLIGHT
HOW MUCH IS ROUND TRIP
WELL SWORDS TEND TO BE SUFFICIENT TO TAKE OUT DRAGONS WHEN USED PROPERLY SO I ASSUME SO
HIROSHIMA NUKE AKA LITTLE BOY

THE FIREBALL WAS METRES FT IN DIAMETER
SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF C F
NEAR GROUND ZERO EVERYTHING FLAMMABLE BURST INTO FLAME
FIRESTORM WAS ROUGHLY KILOMETRES MI IN DIAMETER
BLAST EQUIVALENT TO KILOTONS OF TNT
SOME PEOPLE KILLED BY BLAST FIRESTORM
ESTIMATED THAT SQUARE MILES OF THE CITY WERE DESTROYED

VS

A DRAGON
WELL YOU HAVE THE HUGE SHOCKWAVE THAT WILL PROBABLY RIP AND TEAR HIM AND EVEN HE SURVIVES THIS WHICH COULD BE POSSIBLE WITH HIS THICK DRAGON SKIN THERE IS THE RADIATION EVEN IF HE DIE AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE HE'D PROBABLY GROSSLY MUTATED IN THAT CASE MIDDLE-EARTH HAS A BIG PROBLEM JUST IMAGINE A ANCALAGON THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE VERY DEFINITION OF OVERKILL
I'M PRETTY SURE THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL GET A DECENT COPY OF THE BOOKS IS TO ACTUALLY BUY THE PHYSICAL BOOKS
I'M STILL KEEPING HOPE ALIVE THAT THEY WILL PRINT ANOTHER EDITION AT SOME POINT
IT IS NOT NON-EXISTENT BUT ELROD IS NOT SIMILAR TO MOVIE ELROD ON THIS ASPECT I SUGGEST THAT YOU READ TALE OF ARAGON AND ARWEN FROM THE APPENDIXES ONCE YOU'VE READ THE RETURN OF THE KING
READ THE APPENDICES AFTER YOU'RE DONE

I JUST FINISHED THE BOOK INCLUDED ALL THREE LAST NIGHT AND IN MY OPINION COMPARED TO THE MOVIE SHE IS VERY NON-EXISTENT

I STILL QUESTION WHY PETER JACKSON CHANGED WHO TAKES FRODO TO RIVENDELL WHEN HE GETS STABBED BY THE WITCH KING

IT IS NOT NON-EXISTENT IN THE BOOKS BUT SHE IS NOT IN TNT MUCH OF WHAT IS IN THE MOVIE IS FROM THE SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

ALSO THE MOVIES WERE WRITTEN BY JACKSON BOYERS AND WALSH
ERU ALAR AND MORGOTH IN HIS PRIME MAAR CALAQUENDI ALL OTHER CHILDREN OF ILLUVATAR

VERY ROUGHLY AND WITH VARIOUS EXCEPTIONS
IT'S NOT REALLY EASY TO RANK THINGS IN WRITING ERU IS GOD AND IS AT THE TOP BUT AFTER THAT IS GETS CONFUSING YOU'D GENERALLY HAVE THE ALAR AND MAAR BUT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULES AND JUST BECAUSE TWO THING MIGHT BOTH BE MAAR OR BOTH BE ELVES DOES NOT MAKE THEM EQUAL
ERU ALAR MAAR ELVES MEN DWARVES
BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH AND 2 ARE BOTH PRETTY FUN IMO REAL TIME STRATEGY GAMES YOU CAN PLAY CAMPAIGNS AS BOTH GOOD AND EVIL FACTIONS THAT ROUGHLY FOLLOW EVENTS OF THE STORY

IF YOU'VE PLAYED ANY OF THE TOTAL WAR GAMES THIRD AGE TOTAL WAR IS A COMPLETE OVERHAUL MOD FOR MEDIEVAL 2 PERSONALLY I THINK THIS IS THE BEST LORD OF THE RINGS EXPERIENCE TO BE HAD IN PC GAMING

THERE IS ALSO LORD OF THE RINGS ONLINE IF YOU'RE INTO AMMOS NEVER PLAYED THIS ONE MYSELF
HOBBITS ARE STONERS WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT PILEWEED IS BASICALLY A FORM OF NICOTINA ESSENTIALLY TOBACCO AS TZOLKIN STATES IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF PART 2 IN THE FOR PROLOGUE

AS FAR AS GAMES GO THERE AREN'T ANY TRULY EXCEPTIONAL GAMES BASED ON LOAR SOM WAS GOOD YOU CAN HAVE FUN WITH THE BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH GAMES THE THIRD AGE WAS ALWAYS FUN TOO BUT AS FAR AS LORE BASED GAMES THERE'S NOT MUCH
GOOD PC GAMES FOR THE MIDDLE EARTH LORE



SHADOW OF MORDOR

PICK ONE


IN ALL SERIOUSNESS SHADOW OF MORDOR IS HORRIBLE LORE WISE IT'S A FUN GAME BUT THE STORY IS ESSENTIALLY A POORLY WRITTEN FANATIC HARDLY ANYTHING IN THAT GAME IS LORE ACCURATE

IN FACT I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE GAMES GO PARTICULARLY OUT OF THEIR WAY TO BE TRUE TO THE LORE THE CLOSEST THING IN EXISTENCE IS PROBABLY LORD OF THE RINGS ONLINE BUT EVEN THAT HAS ITS OCCASIONAL DISCREPANCIES


ALSO HOW AM I JUST LEARNING THAT HOBBITS ARE STONERS AM I THAT STUPID

I WOULDN'T SAY THAT YOU'RE STUPID BUT YOU DEFINITELY HAVE SOME READING COMPREHENSION PROBLEMS IS VERY EXPLICITLY TOBACCO AND THAT IS MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IN THE STORY
SIL IS A FANTASTIC LORE FRIENDLY ROUGELIKE


ALSO HOW AM I JUST LEARNING THAT HOBBITS ARE STONERS AM I THAT STUPID

READ THE PROLOGUE AGAIN ITS A VARIETY OF TOBACCO

THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH

THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH II THE RISE OF THE

THE LORD OF THE RINGS CONQUEST

THE LORD OF THE RINGS WAR IN THE NORTH

LEGO THE HOBBIT

LEGO THE LORD OF THE RINGS
I HAVE ALREADY PLAYED SHADOW OF MORDOR BUT WOULD LIKE SOME MORE IF POSSIBLE ANY OTHER GOOD MEDIAS THAT GO WITH THE LORE IS GOOD TOO

I AM NOT A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER SO PERHAPS I MISSED SOME NUANCE DOES THIS SUGGEST THAT SOM IS GOOD WITH LORE
HOBBIT GAME IT'S BEEN A COUPLE YEARS SINCE I PLAYED IT BUT I DON'T THINK IT BLATANTLY RUINS ANY PART OF THE LORE ADDS SOME SMALL TIDBITS IN DEFINITELY CAPTURES THE LIGHT-HEARTED THEME OF THE HOBBIT THAT THE MOVIES GIVE NO JUSTICE TO IT IS MY FAVORITE GAME
BEST ONE WOULD BE THIRD AGE TOTAL WAR CURRENTLY PLAYING THIS GAME AND I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY NEW THINGS I AM LEARNING ALSO IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO DISCOVER ALL THE EVENTFUL LOCATIONS ON THE MAP

FOR EXAMPLE TRACKING THE PATH OF THE FELLOWSHIP AFTER THEY TOOK OFF FROM RIVENDELL OR TRACKING THE PATH OF FRODO ALL THE WAY FROM THE SHIRE TO MORDOR
I MADE THIS POST ABOUT A CERTAIN SHITTY MAP BUT IT COVERS WHAT YOU'RE ASKING AS WELL

R LOAR COMMENTS
I'M PRETTY SURE HE DOESN'T SAY THAT IN THE BOOKS PROBABLY BECAUSE ARAGON IS READY TO STEP UP TO BEING A KING AT THAT POINT

A LOT OF CONTRADICTORY MOVIE STUFF IS LIKE THAT I CALL IT PPP PETER AND PHILIPA PROBLEMS

PETER AND PHILIPA PROBABLY FIGURED MOST MOVIEGOERS WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT CONTEXT IT PROVIDES A NICE BIT OF DRAMA BUT I WOULDN'T READ TOO MUCH INTO IT
FIRSTLY AS U RAKING SAID THAT CONVERSATION DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THE BOOKS AND AS SUCH IS TO BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT

BUT SECONDLY EVEN IF WE TAKE IT AT FACE VALUE I THINK YOU'RE EITHER MISREMEMBERING OR MISINTERPRETING THE SCENE IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE IMPLICATION OF QUOTE THAT THE BLOOD OF NÚMENOR IS A GREATER LINE THAN OTHER MEN CLASHES WITH THE FACT THAT ISILDUR WHO IS OF THAT BLOOD ALLOWED THE RING AND THUS SARON TO CONTINUE EXISTING

HOWEVER READ THE QUOTE IN CONTEXT AGAIN
THE RACE OF MEN IS FAILING THE BLOOD OF NÚMENOR IS ALL BUT SPENT ITS PRIDE AND DIGNITY FORGOTTEN IT IS BECAUSE OF MEN THE RING SURVIVES
I WAS THERE GANDALF I WAS THERE THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ISILDUR TOOK THE RING I WAS THERE THE DAY THE STRENGTH OF MEN FAILED
I LED ISILDUR INTO THE HEART OF MOUNT DOOM WHERE THE RING WAS FORGED THE ONE PLACE IT COULD BE DESTROYED
IT ENDED THAT DAY BUT EVIL WAS ALLOWED TO ENDURE
ISILDUR KEPT THE RING THE LINE OF KINGS IS BROKEN THERE IS NO STRENGTH LEFT IN THE WORLD OF MEN THEY'RE SCATTERED DIVIDED LEADERLESS

THE WHOLE SECTION MAKES IT VERY CLEAR I THINK THAT IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE OF FAILURE IN ADDITION TO THE LATER BREAKING OF THE LINE OF KINGS THAT ELROD THINKS THAT THE BLOOD OF NÚMENOR IS ALL BUT SPENT WATCHING WEAKNESS ON WHAT ELROD CALLS THE DAY THE STRENGTH OF MEN FAILED CONVINCED HIM THAT THE GLORY DAYS OF MEN ARE OVER
YES THE LINE OF NÚMENOR IS THAT OF HIS BROTHER BUT HE SEEMS TO THINK OF THOSE DAYS DIFFERENTLY IN TERMS OF PRIDE AND DIGNITY IF ANYTHING I'D SAY IT MAKES SENSE THAT HE WOULD BE ESPECIALLY BITTER THAT THE GREAT HOUSE OF HIS BROTHER HAD FALLEN SO LOW

BUT AGAIN ALL THIS IS MOVIE STUFF ELROD IS A QUITE DIFFERENT CHARACTER IN THE BOOKS
THE FRODO DROP
THE FRODO FUNKY CHICKEN DANCE
I CAN'T TELL IF YOU'RE A TROLL OR NOT
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE WROTE HIS BOOKS IN THE AND AND ENGLAND DIDN'T OFFICIALLY ADOPT THE METRIC SYSTEM BEFORE THE LATE
YOU KNOW BRITAIN USES MILES RIGHT
YOU KNOW WE STILL EXIST HERE IN BRITAIN RIGHT
EVEN IF TZOLKIN ADN T BEEN BORN IN I SUSPECT HE WOULD HAVE STUCK TO THE OLD-FASHIONED IMPERIAL UNITS REMEMBER THIS IS THE MAN WHO ONCE HUMOROUSLY THREATENED IN HIS LETTERS TO STOP SPEAKING ANYTHING BUT OLD MERCIAN
THE HOBBITS ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE SUCH MEASUREMENTS THAN THE PEOPLE OF CONDOR OR ROHAN THE LANGUAGE GETS MORE ARCHAIC IN THE TWO TOWERS THE HOBBITS ARE ACTUALLY BASED ON CENTURY ENGLISHMEN IN THE APPENDICES TZOLKIN EXPLAINS THIS AS A DECISION BY THE TRANSLATOR BUT THE TRANSLATOR APPARENTLY ALSO ADDED ANACHRONISTIC REFERENCES TO ITEMS SUCH AS MANTEL CLOCKS UMBRELLAS WAISTCOATS AND AN EXPRESS TRAIN TO BYWATER
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
REFERRING TO THE SHORT FOREIGN FILM IT'S A TRAVESTY THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MADE
PRINCESS MIKA NEVER EXISTED
YOU POSTED THIS EXACT SAME THREAD 2 DAYS AGO WHY ARE YOU POSTING IT AGAIN
MORE THAN LIKELY JUST MORE OF PAOLINI COPYING OTHER WORKS AT BEST YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS AN EASTER EGG THERE IS NO WAY THE TWINS ARE ACTUALLY THE SAME AS THE BLUE WIZARDS
DID YOU ASK SOME QUESTION OR WHAT THERE IS NO WAY THE CHARACTERS WOULD BE THE SAME SINCE THE WORLD IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PAOLINI DOES NOT ADD ANYTHING INTO THE LEGENDARIUM
WASN'T THE SCENE WITH MERRY AND PIPPIN WASHING DISHES BEFORE GOODBYE SPEECH
WHO'S SLAG THE TERRIBLE

BARD
THIS QUESTION COMES UP A LOT SO I'LL GIVE YOU A QUICK AND DIRTY VERSION YOU CAN FIND ANY NUMBER OF LARGE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT ON THIS SUB

ESSENTIALLY POWER WAS LIMITED CONCERNING THIS SPECIFIC STRUGGLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST SARON GANDALF HAD TO PLAY BY CERTAIN RULES AND COULDN'T BRING HIS FULL POWER TO BEAR IN THE WAR OF THE RING

HOWEVER THE BARONG WAS FROM ANOTHER CONFLICT ENTIRELY COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO THE CONFLICT AT HAND BARONGS WERE FROM THE WAR OF WRATH IN THE FIRST AGE I THINK AND AS SUCH GANDALF WAS EFFECTIVELY UNFETTERED
THERE IS NO WHERE AT ALL NOT EVEN IN THE MOVIES WHERE IT'S STATED THAT GANDALF CAN'T BEAT THE

IN THE MOVIES THEY BUILD UP A SORT OF RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO WHERE GANDALF IS CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING TO FACE HIM BUT THAT DOESN'T EXIST AT ALL IN THE BOOKS

IN REALITY EVEN THE FULL NINE WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME DEALING WITH GANDALF ACTUALLY FIGHTING AND DEFINITELY COULD NOT DEFEAT HIM JUST DRIVE HIM AWAY AT BEST AS HAS BEEN STATED ALREADY THOUGH THAT IS A MOOT POINT ENTIRELY AS GANDALF IS NOT ALLOWED TO MATCH STRENGTH WITH FORCES HIS ROLE IN THE WAR IS LIMITED TO INSPIRING AND ORGANIZING THE AND DEFENDING HIMSELF AS NEEDED IN THAT ROLE
CAN YOU PROVIDE A QUOTE STATING THAT GANDALF CANNOT DEFEAT THE WITCH KING IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THE WITCH KING WOULD HAVE POWER OVER GANDALF ESPECIALLY AS THE WHITE WIZARD

DANGEROUS CRIED GANDALF AND SO AM I VERY DANGEROUS MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANYTHING YOU WILL EVER MEET UNLESS YOU ARE BROUGHT ALIVE BEFORE THE SEAT OF THE DARK LORD

GANDALF THE WHITE THE TWO TOWERS

THIS QUOTE FROM THE WHITE IMPLIES THAT GANDALF IS STRONGER THAN ANY BEING IN MIDDLE EARTH SAVE SARON

THE CLOSEST THING I COULD EVEN FIND SHOWING THAT THE WITCH KING COULD BE A THREAT TO GANDALF IS THE FOLLOWING QUOTE WHICH REALLY DOESN'T CONFIRM ANYTHING

YET NOW UNDER THE LORD OF THE MOST FELL OF ALL HIS CAPTAINS IS ALREADY MASTER OF YOUR OUTER WALLS SAID GANDALF KING OF INGMAR LONG AGO SORCERER RINGWRAITH LORD OF THE NAZGÛL A SPEAR OF TERROR IN THE HAND OF SARON SHADOW OF DESPAIR

THEN MITHRANDIR YOU HAD A FOE TO MATCH YOU SAID DENETHOR FOR MYSELF I HAVE LONG KNOWN WHO IS THE CHIEF CAPTAIN OF THE HOSTS OF THE DARK TOWER IS THIS ALL THAT YOU HAVE RETURNED TO SAY OR CAN IT BE THAT YOU HAVE WITHDRAWN BECAUSE YOU ARE OVERMATCHED

PIPPIN TREMBLED FEARING THAT GANDALF WOULD BE STUNG TO SUDDEN WRATH BUT HIS FEAR WAS NEEDLESS IT MIGHT BE SO GANDALF ANSWERED SOFTLY BUT OUR TRIAL OF STRENGTH IS NOT YET COME AND IF WORDS SPOKEN OF OLD BE TRUE NOT BY THE HAND OF MAN SHALL HE FALL AND HIDDEN FROM THE WISE IS THE DOOM THAT AWAITS HIM HOWEVER THAT MAY BE THE CAPTAIN OF DESPAIR DOES NOT PRESS FORWARD YET HE RULES RATHER ACCORDING TO THE WISDOM THAT YOU HAVE JUST SPOKEN FROM THE REAR DRIVING HIS SLAVES IN MADNESS ON BEFORE

THE RETURN OF THE KING
IT'S A MOVIE ONLY THING IN THE BOOKS GANDALF STATES THAT IN MIDDLE EARTH ONLY SARON IS HIS EQUAL IN STRENGTH AFTER HE CAME BACK AS THE WHITE

THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE WITCH KING AND GANDALF IN THE BOOKS ENDED AFTER FLAME APPEARED TO CONSUME THE SWORD BUT STAFF WAS NOT BROKEN AND HE WAS NOT THROWN BACKWARDS
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT GANDALF AND ALL THE WIZARDS IN MIDDLE EARTH AREN'T MAGICALLY GIFTED HUMANS THEY'RE ACTUALLY ESSENTIALLY LESSER GODS CALLED MAAR

THEIR MISSION WAS TO GUIDE THE RACES IN MIDDLE EARTH TO DEFEAT SARON SO IN THE FIGHTS AGAINST SARON THEY COULDN'T INTERFERE DIRECTLY MAGICALLY

THE BARLOW ARE ACTUALLY ALSO MAAR THAT FELL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MORGOTH THINK BAUDRONS BOSS MENTOR AND FAR WORSE THAN SARON COULD EVER BE SINCE GANDALF AND THE BARLOW ARE BOTH ON THE SAME POWER LEVEL THEY FOUGHT FAIRLY AND SINCE THE BARLOW HAS NO REAL PART IN ANYTHING SARON RELATED GANDALF COULD GO FULL FORCE AND KILL THE BARLOW
GANDALF COULD SNEEZE THE WITCH KING OUT OF EXISTENCE
ONLY GIRLS CAN BEAT THE WITCH KING
WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT WHERE THEY MET IN THE BOOKS IT WAS AT THE GATES OF MINAS TIGRISH AS GROND TORE THEM DOWN THE WITCH KING WALKED IN AND EVERYONE FLED IN TERROR EXCEPT GANDALF THEY SHARED SOME WORDS SHOWING NEITHER WAS SCARED OF THE OTHER THEN ROHAN BREAKS UP THE PARTY

THE KEY THING IS THAT GANDALF WAS NOT AFRAID OF THE WITCH KING HE TOLD THE WITCH KING TO PISS OFFICIAL I DON'T THINK IT WAS SUICIDAL POSTURING BUT GANDALF KNOWING HE COULD WHOOP THE WITCH KING AND ANY OF HIS FRIENDS THAT DECIDED TO COME ALONG
THE BARONG WAS PHYSICALLY MUCH LARGER THAT THE WITCH KING BUT WIZARDS DON'T FIGHT WITH PHYSICAL STRENGTH THEY FIGHT WITH MAGICAL STRENGTH IT SEEMS LOGICAL THAT THE WITCH MAGIC IS STRONGER THAN THE
BECAUSE THE WITCH KING IS A BAD MF LOOK ON HIS WALLET
MOST PEOPLE ITT ARE SAYING IT'S NOT ROLE TO INTERFERE IN THE WAR OF THE RING BUT THE BARONG WASN'T PART OF PLAN ERGO HE COULD PUT FORTH HIS FULL POWER I AGREE WITH THIS

BUT I'D ALSO SPECULATE THAT THE WITCH KING IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE BARONG ESPECIALLY MOUNTED ON A NAGUAL THAT MOTHERFUCKER IS POWERFUL AS FUCK RIGHT HAND MAN AIN'T GOING TO BE NO BITCH OF COURSE MERRY AND ELWYN ENDED UP DEFEATING HIM WHICH ALWAYS SEEMED A BIT INCONSISTENT TO ME ANYWAY

ASK NOT THE ELVES FOR ADVICE BECAUSE THEY WILL TELL YOU BOTH YES AND NO
MAE GOVANNEN SOUNDS SO FRIENDLY AND SINCERE
A STAR SHINES ON THE HOUR OF OUR MEETING

ALEN AILA LUMEN OMENTIELVO
AURA ENTULUVA OR DAY SHALL COME AGAIN SAID BY HARBIN STANDING ALONE AND FACING CERTAIN DEATH AT THE HANDS OF FORCES
MELLON

FRIENDS DON'T LIE

EDIT WRONG SUB I THOUGHT THIS WAS ABOUT STRANGER THINGS
MINE IS ABUTA MIQUELA ORDU WHICH IS AN INSULT AND MEANS GO KISS AN ORC
LAST TIME THEY DIRECTLY INTERFERED WITH MIDDLE EARTH THE DESTRUCTION SANK MOST OF A CONTINENT I IMAGINE THEY WANT TO AVOID THAT
THE ONLY ACTION I AM AWARE THEY TAKE IS WHEN THEY SEND IN THE INSTAR

TO BE FAIR IT TURNS OUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
THERE ARE A COUPLE CLEAR SIGNS OF THE ALAR THROWING A LITTLE NUDGE DURING THE WAR OF THE RING I THINK THE BIGGEST AREA OF HELP IS ARAGON AND THE GREY COMPANY'S TAKING OF THE BLACK SHIPS AFTER THEY HAD TAKEN THE SHIPS THEY RECEIVED A GOODLY WIND TO SPEED THEM ON THEIR WAY FANWE LORD OF THE AIR AND A MIST SURROUNDED THEM ON THE WATER ULMO LORD OF THE SEA THERE WERE A COUPLE MORE TIMES I SAW LITTLE HINTS AT IT BUT I CAN'T RECALL THEM OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD
I DON'T BUY INTO THE NOTION THAT THEY WOULD DESTROY A LOT OF MIDDLE EARTH THIS HAPPENED WHEN THE ALAR WERE GOING UP AGAINST A FAR STRONGER MELIOR WITH FAR MORE DEADLY WEAPONS GIVEN THIS THE ALAR WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED SARON SAURURAN BOTH OF WHICH ARE EQUAL TO OR SLIGHTLY MORE POWERFUL THAN GANDALF THE WHITE AND THEIR JOINED ARMIES WITH EASE IT WOULD BE SO EASY AND SO QUICK THAT MIDDLE EARTH WOULD TAKE VERY MINIMAL DAMAGE IF ANY AT ALL



THE ALAR KNEW THIS AND KNEW THAT IT WOULD TAKE A LESSER HOST IN THE INSTAR THEY ALSO REALIZED THE TIME OF MEN IN MIDDLE EARTH WAS COMING AND ALLOWING THEM TO HANDLE THIS THEMSELVES FURTHER INSURED THAT SUCH A TIME WAS COMING THE ERA OF ELVES AND GODS AND THEIR MAGIC WAS FADING AND IF THE ALAR HAD INTERVENED THEIR ABILITIES COULD HAVE STARTED A NEW WAVE OF MAGICAL ABILITIES OF THE POPULATION OF MIDDLE EARTH COMPLETELY CHANGING THE OUTCOME OF AN AGE OF MEN
WELL TZOLKIN DIDN'T WANT HIS WORK TO BE SEEN AS AN ALLEGORY BUT HE DOESN'T DENY THAT HIS BIBLICAL THEMES EXIST AND INFLUENCED HIS WORK IN AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHY DOES GOD ALLOW EVIL TO EXIST HE WOULD SAY THAT GREATER ACTS OF GOOD COME ABOUT AND ARE EXPERIENCED IF WE CHOOSE TO DO GOOD RATHER THAN GOD JUST DOING EVERYTHING AND NOT HAVING HUMANS CHOOSE TO GOOD THERE IS SOME GOOD WRITING HE DOES ABOUT THIS IDEA

IN THIS UNDERSTANDING THE THEME DIRECTLY TIES TO MIDDLE EARTH GANDALF AND THE OTHER INSTAR AND BAD ASS DUDES BUT ARE TOLD TO VEIL THEIR TRUE POWER THEY ARE TO ONLY NUDGE PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ESSENTIALLY MOSTLY GANDALF BEING GIVEN THE RING OF FIRE TO KINDLE THE HEARTS OF PEOPLE YES THE ALAR AND ERU ILLUVITAR HAVE INTERVENED AT TIMES BUT I THINK THE THEME OF MEN AND THEIR GIFT OF MORTALITY AND OF CHOICE OF FREE WILL ESSENTIALLY THE ELVES BEING BOUND TO NATURE AND THE NATURAL FLOW OF THINGS ALONG WITH MAGIC MUST LEAVE AT THE END OF THE THIRD AGE WITH THE ENDING OF THE ONE RING AND DWINDLING OF THE THREE RINGS TIED

UNDERSTANDING THAT MIDDLE EARTH IS ALL A MYTHOLOGY CREATED FOR EUROPE WITH THE LEAVING OF THE ELVES AND THE START OF THE AGE OF MEN TZOLKIN IS CONVEYING THAT WE ARE LIVING IN THE TIME OF MEN THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THROUGH HIS MYTHOLOGY WHY ELVES AND MAGIC DON'T REALLY EXIST ANYMORE

WITH HIS INFLUENCE OF CATHOLICISM AND HIS LOVE OF NORSE MYTHOLOGY IT REALLY MAKES FOR AN INTERESTING CONCEPT
THE DWARVES DID ASSEMBLE AN ARMY FOR THE WAR AT LEAST THE EASTERN DWARVES OF ERECTOR THEY HAD TO DEFEND THE MOUNTAIN AGAINST AN ATTACK FROM EASTERLING ALONGSIDE THE MEN OF DALE

IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY DWARVES PARTICIPATED IN THE BATTLE BUT WE CAN ASSUME THEY WERE ABLE TO ASSEMBLE THEIR ARMY REASONABLY QUICKLY TO RESPOND TO THE THREAT
A LEGION OF DWARVES FULLY ARMED AND FILTHY
WELL WE KNOW FROM THE HOBBIT THAT DAIN WAS ABLE TO RAISE MAYBE DWARVES AND SEND THEM TO HELP THORIN ON PRETTY SHORT ORDER I CAN'T RECALL THE EXACT TIMES BUT I THINK IT'S LESS THAN A MONTH FROM DEATH TO DWARVES SHOWING UP

SO IF THE IRON HILLS ARE ANY INDICATION SOMETHING LIKE DWARVES MUST BE A PRETTY SMALL MANAGEABLE FORCE TO SEND OUT THIS WAS PROBABLY THE GARRISON SMALL PERSONAL FORCE THAT DAIN COULD IMMEDIATELY CALL TOGETHER

I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE FOR TIMES THAT MANY DWARVES TO APPEAR IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS FROM THE ENTIRE DWARVES SO MAYBE OR MORE COULD HAVE ARRIVED GIVEN ENOUGH TIME

BY THE TIME OF THE WAR OF THE RING LOTS OF THOSE DWARVES AND PERHAPS SOME FROM THE BLUE MOUNTAINS HAVE MOVED TO ERECTOR IT'S ONLY BEEN YEARS BUT A DWARF IN THEIR COULD PROBABLY STILL FIGHT IN A BATTLE I THINK GIMLI WAS PROHIBITED FROM THE BILBO EXCURSION BECAUSE HE WAS ONLY IN HIS OR AND TOO YOUNG BY DWARVES STANDARDS

HOWEVER DWARVES DON'T HAVE LOTS OF CHILDREN I THINK SO PERHAPS WITH IMMIGRANT DWARVES AND SOME POPULATION GROWTH THE LONELY MOUNTAIN COULD FIELD AXES ON PRETTY SHORT NOTICE THIS WOULD MAKE THE GENERAL POPULATION OVER IN THE MOUNTAIN ASSUMING A PRETTY SOLID MILITARIZATION EFFORT

THIS IS MOSTLY GUT FEELING AND ESTIMATION SO FEEL FREE TO STRETCH THE NUMBERS WHICHEVER WAY YOU WANT I EAST HIGHER PERCENTAGE INVOLVED IN THE WAR EFFORT JUST MY TWO CENTS
THE ONLY THING THEY WOULD DO IS PROTECT THEIR TREASURE HOARDS THEY PROBABLY HAD AN ARMY PRESENT IN THEIR DWELLINGS IRON HILLS ERECTOR ETC ANYWAY
FOOL OF A TOOK ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO DOWNVOTE IF THY OPINION DIFFER JUST LEAVE IT BE IS WHAT I THINK HE WOULD SAY

I THINK ANYBODY WHO WOULD USE THE PHRASE FOOL OF A TOOK WOULD BE PERFECTLY FINE WITH DOWNVOTING STUPID THINGS
IT'S A G RUNE FOR GANDALF
OH HELLO IT'S THE NORSE WEALTH RUNE LOOKS NICE MATE
THEY ARE EXTREMELY SIMILAR
GOOD CATCH
YOU CAN'T REALLY TAKE THIS AS PROOF FOR ANY OF YOUR CLAIMS YES ELVES ARE LIGHT ON THEIR FEET AND FAST YES DWARVES CARRY A LOT OF HEAVY ARMOR BUT THEY ARE ALSO BUILT FOR DRAGGING AROUND A LOT OF WEIGHT AND THEY ARE EVEN THEN FAST OVER SHORT DISTANCES

I WOULD AGREE THAT ELVES ARE FASTER THEN ANY OTHER BUT THIS VIDEO ISN'T PROOF OF ANY OF IT EVEN IF THE MOVIES WERE ANYTHING CLOSE TO CANON

I GUESS IT'S DUE TO ALL THE ARMOR THE DAWES CARRY BUT ALMOST A AITH OF THE TIME IS STILL IMPRISVE OF THE ELVES
IT'S THAT WAY IN THE BOOKS TOO THAT'S HOW SAM WAS INTRODUCED TO HIM SO THAT'S HOW HE REFERS TO HIM
PROBABLY THE SAME REASON YOU KEEP CALLING YOUR PARENTS MOM AND DAD AFTER YOU'VE LEARNED THAT THEY TOO HAVE NAMES OF THEIR OWN CONVENIENCE AND HABIT
THERE IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ORDER OF EVENTS IN THE BOOK THE EARLY PART IS MUCH LONGER AND GANDALF TELLS FRODO TO LEAVE BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY GANDALF IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP AT HOME TO ESCORT HIM BUT THEN HE IS CAPTURED BY SAURURAN SO FRODO LEAVES WITH JUST THE OTHER HOBBITS

NOW WHEN THEY ARRIVE IN BREE THE INNKEEPER HAS A LETTER FROM GANDALF THAT THE INNKEEPER FORGOT TO SEND THE LETTER TELLS FRODO TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY AND THAT GANDALF WILL FOLLOW HIM AS SOON AS HE CAN THE LETTER ALSO MENTIONS ARAGON

YOU MAY MEET A FRIEND OF MINE ON THE ROAD A MAN LEAN
DARK TALL BY SOME CALLED STRIDER HE KNOWS OUR BUSINESS AND WILL HELP YOU
MAKE FOR RIVENDELL THERE I HOPE WE MAY MEET AGAIN IF I DO NOT COME ELROD
WILL ADVISE YOU

NOW ARAGON IS DELIBERATELY LOOKING FOR THEM AS HE SEEMS TO HAVE SPOTTED THEM BEFORE THE REACHED BREE GANDALF ALSO ADDS THIS TO THE LETTER

MAKE SURE THAT IT IS THE REAL STRIDER THERE ARE MANY STRANGE MEN
ON THE ROADS HIS TRUE NAME IS ARAGON

SO THE HOBBITS FIND OUT HIS REAL NAME IN BREE

THE LETTER ALSO CONTAINS A POEM ABOUT ARAGON THAT MENTIONS THE BROKEN BLADE AND ACTUALLY CARRIES AROUND HIS BROKEN BLADE AND TWICE USES IT TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF

I DID NOT KNOW HE ANSWERED BUT I AM ARAGON AND THOSE VERSES GO
WITH THAT NAME HE DREW OUT HIS SWORD AND THEY SAW THAT THE BLADE WAS INDEED
BROKEN A FOOT BELOW THE HILT NOT MUCH USE IS IT SAM SAID STRIDER BUT
THE TIME IS NEAR WHEN IT SHALL BE FORGED ANEW

AND THE HOBBITS HAVE THE HABIT OF REFERRING TO HIM AS STRIDER THIS IS WHEN MERRY IS LEFT IN ROHAN AND ASKS THRODDEN ABOUT IT

TWICE NOW LORD I HAVE HEARD OF THE PATHS OF THE DEAD HE SAID WHAT
ARE THEY AND WHERE HAS STRIDER I MEAN THE LORD ARAGON WHERE HAS HE GONE

HE WRAPPED HIS GREY CLOAK
ABOUT HIM HIDING HIS AND STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG LEGS THEN HE LAY
BACK AND SENT FROM HIS LIPS A THIN STREAM OF SMOKE

LOOK SAID PIPPIN STRIDER THE RANGER HAS COME BACK

HE HAS NEVER BEEN AWAY SAID ARAGON I AM STRIDER AND DÚNADAN TOO
AND I BELONG BOTH TO CONDOR AND THE NORTHERN

ONE OF HIS NAMES IN RIVENDELL IS THE DÚNADAN MEANING MAN OF THE WESTERN
PIPPIN IN THE BOOKS ALSO REFERS TO ARAGON AS STRIDER UNTIL RETURN OF THE KING HE DOES NOT REALLY SEEM TO PROCESS ARAGON IS ACTUAL THE KING TILL HE GETS TO CONDOR WHEN GANDALF FLAT OUT TELLS HIM NOT TO MENTION ARAGON IN FRONT OF DENETHOR
CIRC ALL THE HOBBITS EXCEPT MAYBE FRODO CONTINUE TO CALL HIM STRIDER
I RECOMMEND READING THEM IN PUBLICATION ORDER WHILE YOU CERTAINLY COULD START WITH THE SILMARILLION IT'S THE TOUGHEST READ OF THE THREE THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S THE WORST OF THE THREE IT'S JUST WRITTEN IN A DELIBERATELY ARCHAIC STYLE AND IS PACKED WITH INFORMATION IT'S LIKE READING THE BIBLE AND I FOUND THAT I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT UNTIL I READ IT TWICE

THE HOBBIT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIES IT'S NOT A PREQUEL TO THE LORD OF THE RINGS IT'S A STAND ALONE BOOK IT WAS WRITTEN FOR CHILDREN BUT IT WAS WRITTEN TO BE READ TO CHILDREN SO THERE'S A LOT THERE FOR ADULTS IT'S ALSO A RELATIVELY SHORT READ

THE LORD OF THE RINGS ASSUMES SOME FAMILIARITY WITH THE HOBBIT ALTHOUGH IT'S CERTAINLY NOT NECESSARY TO READ THE HOBBIT FIRST IT IS HELPFUL FAMILIARITY WITH THE SILMARILLION ALSO SHEDS LIGHT ON THE LORD OF THE RINGS BUT NO SUCH FAMILIARITY WAS ASSUMED BECAUSE THE SILMARILLION HAD NOT BEEN PUBLISHED THE LORD OF THE RINGS STARTED AS A SEQUEL TO THE HOBBIT BUT THE SILMARILLION KEPT LEAKING IN AND EVENTUALLY IT BECAME FAR TOO BIG OF A BOOK FOR MOST CHILDREN
I ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND LOAR AFTER THE SILMARILLION IT'S REALLY GREAT GOING THROUGH AND UNDERSTANDING ALL THE REFERENCES TO THE ELDER DAYS

ALL OF WORKS HAVE REALLY GREAT VALUE I READ LOAR ROUGHLY ONCE EVERY YEAR OR SO
NOPE HOBBIT LOAR SILMARILLION

THERE'S VALUE IN HAVING THE STORY TOLD IN THE ORDER THE AUTHOR INTENDED YOU WOULDN'T ASK SHOULD I READ THE LAST CHAPTER OF LOAR BEFORE THE FIRST
THE HOBBIT LORD OF THE RINGS THE SILMARILLIO CHILDREN OF AURIN LORD OF THE RINGS THE HOBBIT IS A NICE SHORT ADVENTURE STORY THE SILMARILLION IS BASICALLY A HISTORY BOOK WHILE INTERESTING IT CAN ALSO READ LIKE ONE AND IF YOU LORD OF THE RINGS AFTER THAT AS THERE ARE SOME REFERENCES IN SONGS
MY ADVICE IS HOBBIT FIRST BECAUSE IT IS THE EASIEST READ THEN IF YOU ENJOY STYLE READ LOAR I HAVE FRIENDS THAT DO NOT ENJOY READING A PAGE LONG DESCRIPTION OF A DOOR BUT IN MY OPINION DESCRIPTIVE WRITING IS PART OF WHAT MADE IT SO AMAZING AS WELL AS WHAT MADE THE MOVIES SO BEAUTIFUL

I HAVE YET TO READ SILMARILLION BUT FROM ALL THE ADVICE I'VE SEEN IT IS A VERY EMOTIONAL READ AND AS SOMEONE WHO THREW TWO TOWERS ACROSS THE ROOM WHEN SAM GOT LEFT ALL ALONE I JUST HAVE NOT BEEN READY FOR THAT UNDERTAKING
I SAW THE SIX MOVIES AND THEN READ IN THIS ORDER LOAR HOBBIT SILMARILLION
BUT I WOULD START WITH THE HOBBIT BECAUSE IT'S THE EASIEST TO READ THIS WAY YOU CAN EASE INTO IT A BIT IF YOU START WITH THE SILMARILLION IT MIGHT BE VERY DRY MATERIAL I'M CURRENTLY ENJOYING THE SILMARILLION A LOT BUT THE FIRST CHAPTERS WE'RE A BIT DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH
SO THE ORDER I ADVICE IS HOBBIT LOAR SILMARILLION
REMEMBER READING IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WATCHING A MOVIE TRY TO READ SLOW AND LET EVERYTHING SINK IN WELL AND WATCH THE MAP A LOT TO NOT GET CONFUSED
THINK OF IT LIKE WATCHING THE STAR WARS SAGA FOR THE FIRST TIME START WITH THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY AND THEN THE PREQUEL TRILOGY OR MORE LIKELY START WITH OT AND THEN PRETEND THE PT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE REVENGE OF THE SITH
MY ADVICE IS THIS

OPTION HOBBIT SILMARILLION AUDIOBOOK LORD OF THE RINGS

OPTION 2 HOBBIT LOAR SILMARILLION UNFINISHED TALES LOAR AGAIN

LORD OF THE RINGS IS THE MASTER WORK IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SILMARILLION BE HE DIED EVERYTHING CIRCLES AROUND IT FOR BEST IMPACT SINCE YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIES GO FOR OPTION A IF YOU REEEEEEALLY WANT TO DIVE DEEP INTO THE REALM OPTION B
I WOULD AGREE AS LONG AS YOU CAN GET THROUGH THE SILMARILLION EASY ENOUGH IT'S WONDERFUL AND I PREFER IT OVER ANY OTHER BOOK BUT IT'S A STRUGGLE
I'M HONESTLY NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING BUT I'LL DO MY BEST

THE THREE PRIMARY RACES ARE ELVES DWARVES AND MEN ELVES AND MEN WERE CREATED AND CONCEIVED BY ERU ILLUVATAR AND ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE CHILDREN OF ILLUVATAR OR THE CHILDREN FOR SHORT

DWARVES WERE LATER CONCEIVED BY THE VALA ABLE AS HE WAS IMPATIENT AND TIRED OF WAITING FOR THE COMING OF THE FIRSTBORN ERU GRANTED THE CREATIONS OF ABLE THE GIFT OF SENTIENCE BUT COMMANDED THAT THEY MUST REMAIN ASLEEP UNTIL AFTER THE ELVES HAD AWAKENED

THE QUENDA ELVES WERE THE FIRST OF THE THREE RACES TO AWAKEN THEY ARE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO MANY SUBSETS BASED ON VARIOUS GEOGRAPHICAL AND POLITICAL DECISIONS THAT OCCURRED BEFORE THE DAWN OF THE FIRST AGE I CAN GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT THIS IN ANOTHER COMMENT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED

THE AANI MEN ARE CALLED SUCH BY THE ELVES IT MEANS THE SECOND PEOPLE THE DAIN ARE A GROUPING OF THREE HOUSES OF MEN WHO AIDED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST MORGOTH THE NUMENORIANS ARE DESCENDED FROM THEM

HOBBITS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED A SUBSET OF MEN ALTHOUGH WHERE AND HOW THE DEVIATION IN THEIR PHYSIQUE AND CULTURAL NORMS OCCURRED IS UNCLEAR

ON THIS TOPIC WHO IS THE STRONGEST EA

THIS IS THE PART OF YOUR QUESTION THAT TRULY BAFFLES ME COULD YOU POSSIBLY REWORD IT FOR CLARITY

EA IS THE QUENDA WORD FOR EXISTENCE BUT IS MORE COMMONLY USED AS A SYNONYM FOR THE UNIVERSE BEING ALL THAT EXISTS I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE QUESTION
EA IS THE UNIVERSE ITSELF NOT A CHARACTER

ERU ILLUVATAR IS GOD LIKE CAPITAL G CHRISTIAN GOD ERU IS OMNIPOTENT OMNISCIENT AND BENEVOLENT MAYBE YOU MEANT ERU RATHER THAN EA




I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR ANY MISTAKES ENGLISH IS NOT MY NATIVE LANGUAGE

BUT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LIKE IT I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON IT TSH
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL PICTURES THANKS FOR SHARING
IT'S NUTS HOW LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO TO TURN THOSE LANDSCAPES INTO PERFECT SHOTS FOR THE MOVIES SOME OF YOUR PICTURES JUST LOOK STRAIGHT OUT OF MIDDLE EARTH WITH NO DOCTORING AT ALL
SO GLAD YOU ENJOYED MT SUNDAY IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR LOCATION I VISITED IN AND IT'S STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRAVEL MEMORIES YOU CAN'T OVERSTATE THE BEAUTY OF THAT PLACE
AMAZING PICTURES DUDE I WOULD LOVE TO VISIT HOBBITON THANKS FOR SHARING
THESE PICTURES ARE STUNNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS I'VE BEEN WANTING TO GO TO NZ FOR THE LONGEST TIME TO SEE THE LOAR LOCATIONS AND THIS JUST INSPIRED ME TO START PLANNING
FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR LOCATIONS

LORDOFTHERINGS

DP
GODDAMMIT I WANT TO VISIT THERE SO BAD IF ONLY I WASN'T SO BLOODY SCARED OF FLYING
HOW DID YOU GET AROUND THE ISLANDS I AM GOING THERE TO VISIT HOBBITON IN DECEMBER HAVE ANY TIPS
I'M HEADING TO NZ LATER THIS YEAR AND I'M ABSOLUTELY STOKED TO SEE THE LOAR FILM LOCATIONS

EXCELLENT POST THANK YOU FOR PUTTING IT TOGETHER
I'M SO JEALOUS OF YOU THIS IS LIKE MY DREAM VACATION IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING HOW MUCH USD WAS THE TRIP APPROXIMATELY
THESE PHOTOGRAPHS REALLY MADE ME MISS HOME I WAS BORN AND RAISED HOUR AND MINUTES FROM TONGARIRO MORDOR ALWAYS LOVE SCENERY OF OUR COUNTRYSIDE GLAD YOU ENJOYED YOUR TRIP
I LIVED IN NEW ZEALAND FOR MONTHS AND ONE THING I CAN SAY IS AS COOL AS IT IS GOING TO THE FILMING LOCATIONS YOU SHOULD ENJOY NEW ZEALAND FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY DO NOT ONLY GO JUST TO SEE THE LOCATIONS BECAUSE EVERYWHERE YOU TURN IN NZ LOOKS LIKE ITS RIGHT OFF OF THE SCREEN HOBBITON AND WETA ARE ESPECIALLY COOL BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ANY OTHER PLACES MY ADVICE IS TO JUST TRAVEL AROUND THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN MIDDLE-EARTH NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO
IS ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN
AH MAN THIS WAS GREAT I SPENT OCTOBER NOVEMBER BACKPACKING AROUND NZ LAST YEAR AND MY BROTHER AND I MADE A POINT TO SEE AS MANY FILMING LOCATIONS AS WE COULD WE DIDN'T MAKE IT TO TNT SUNDAY THOUGH WHICH WAS A HUGE BUMMER

DID YOU MAKE IT TO PARADISE WHILE YOU WERE IN GLENORCHY THAT WAS ONE OF OUR FAVORITES
THANKS FOR POSTING THESE ARE GREAT

EDIT NZ IS ON MY LIST TO VISIT BUT THE WIFE WANTS TO SEE A FEW OTHER PLACES FIRST SO MAYBE IN A FEW YEARS
THANKS FOR SHARING I WILL HOPEFULLY BE GOING TO NZ FOR STUDY ABROAD NEXT SEMESTER THE FILMING LOCATIONS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS I WANT TO SEE WHILE I'M THERE
LOVED IT MOUNT SUNDAY WAS MY FAVORITE PLACE IN NZ FOR SURE I HAD QUITE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WITH TONGARIRO THERE WAS LIKE A FOOT OF SNOW PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE TRAIL

THIS IS AN AMAZING POST THANK YOU FOR IT IT REALLY FEELS LIKE THE TRIP WAS SUCCESSFUL AND IT REALLY MAKES ME WANNA TAKE A SIMILAR ONE
WOW CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVEN'T WATCHED THESE YET THANKS FOR SHARING
I HAVEN'T READ IT BUT ISN'T ARAGON A PRETTY SHAMELESS CLONE OF LOAR
BY THE BLUE WIZARDS IN ARAGON ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE TWINS AS THEY BOTH DIE IN THE NEXT BOOK AS THEY ARE KILLED BY BORAN IT TURNS OUT THEY WORK FOR GALBATORIX
THEY ARE NOT HOW COULD THEY BE LEGENDARIUM AND STORIES HAPPEN IN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WORLDS
VERY COOL

COULD HELP A BIT I COULD CARRY IT FOR A WHILE
BUT DID YOU THROW IT IN
BOOMIER ROLLS IN GRAVE
KEEP IT SECRET KEEP IT SAFE WITH TIME I'M SURE IT WILL BECOME PRECIOUS TO YOU
WHY DOES FRODO HAVE SYMPATHY FOR GOLLUM EVEN THOUGH HE TRIED TO KILL THEM AND HE KNOWS HE ONLY WANTS THE RING

BECAUSE FRODO KNOWS WHAT THE LURE OF THE RING FEELS LIKE

BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THE PULL IT'S BEGINNING TO HAVE ON HIM AND CAN FINALLY CATCH A GLIMPSE OF WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE TO BE ENSLAVED TO IT FOR CENTURIES THE WAY GOLLUM HAS BEEN

BECAUSE HE SEES THAT GOLLUM IS A HORRIFYING PREVIEW OF WHAT FRODO HIMSELF WOULD BE LIKE IF HE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO RESIST THE WILL OF THE RING

BECAUSE FRODO BELIEVES THAT IF GOLLUM CAN BE REDEEMED AND SAVED FROM THE SLAVERY THEN FRODO CAN BE SAVED FROM THE SLAVERY
IT'S NOT THAT FRODO FAVORS GOLLUM OVER IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL

IT'S THAT SAM RESPONDS ON THE WAY MOST OF US WOULD BY SEEING GOLLUM AS AN IRREDEEMABLE MONSTER AND WANTING TO KILL HIM IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE FROM WHATEVER HE MAY BE PLOTTING BUT DESPITE THIS FRODO SEES A POTENTIAL FOR GOOD IN GOLLUM SO OR THE SAKE OF THE GOODNESS AND OUT OF PITY AT HOW MUCH GOLLUM HAS SUFFERED DUE TO THE INFLUENCE HE DOESN'T WANT TO MURDER THE POOR PATHETIC CREATURE

IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT FRODO WAS ACTUALLY CORRECT HIS KINDNESS WAS ON THE WAY TO REFORMING GOLLUM IT WASN'T UNTIL THE TWO HOBBITS ESSENTIALLY BETRAYED GOLLUM TO MEN IN ITHILIEN THAT HE WAS LOST AND DECIDED TO BETRAY THEM IN RETURN BY FEEDING THEM TO SHELDON AND YES FRODO FELT THAT HE DID WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO AND IT WAS EITHER ALLOW GOLLUM TO BE CAPTURED OR ALLOW GOLLUM TO BE KILLED BUT CLEARLY THAT NUANCE WAS LOST ON GOLLUM IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS ROUGH TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF THE MEN

OFFHAND I DON'T RECALL HOW MUCH OF THIS WAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT ACROSS IN THE MOVIES BUT DAMN IT IT'S IN THE BOOKS IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE LORE THE FIRST PLACE YOU CAN TURN IS TO THE BOOKS THEY AND NOT THE MOVIES FORM THE DEFINITIVE LOAR CANON
FIRSTLY BECAUSE OF HIS INNATE COMPASSION AND EMPATHY GOLLUM IS AS THEY ALL SAY A WRETCHED CREATURE DESERVING MORE OF PITY THAN HATRED INFLUENCE ALSO WEIGHS HEAVILY ON CHARACTER FRODO SEES MUCH OF HIMSELF IN SMEAGOL BOTH BOTH I BELIEVE THERE'S EVEN A LINE IN THE MOVIES WHERE HE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE I HAVE TO BELIEVE HE CAN COME BACK OBVIOUSLY INDICATING THEY MAY SHARE A SIMILAR FATE

MY SECOND POINT IS THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TRIO ARE ALSO QUITE DIFFERENT IN THE BOOKS THE SCENE BEFORE THEY ENTER CRITH DUNGOL WHERE FRODO TELLS SAM TO GO HOME DOES NOT EXIST IN THE NOVELS I ACTUALLY FIND THAT SCENE RATHER OFFENSIVE CONSIDERING DEMONSTRABLY IMMENSE LOYALTY TO FRODO IT JUST DOESN'T JIVE WITH CHARACTER THAT HE WOULD ABANDON FRODO FOR ANY REASON FRODO DISLIKES TREATMENT OF GOLLUM HIS LACK OF PITY OR UNDERSTANDING BUT HE LOVES SAM HIMSELF AND TRUSTS HIM FAR MORE THAN GOLLUM

OVERALL I DISLIKE THE MOVIE'S PORTRAYAL OF THEIR DYNAMIC AND I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YOU WONDERING WHY FRODO WOULD TAKE WORD ON ANYTHING HE ONLY FOLLOWS HIM INTO MORDOR BECAUSE HE HAS TO AND TRUSTS HIM NOT TO KILL THEM BECAUSE OF THE OATH HE SWORE ON THE PRECIOUS
IT WONT LET ME FLAIR SO JUST IN CASE THIS HAS SPOILERS ITS BEEN WELL OVER A DECADE THOUGH SO GET OVER IT
IT'S ALSO FUN TO THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF GOLLUM BEING NECESSARY FOR THE RINGS DESTRUCTION

IN THE MOVIES AND THE BOOKS FRODO MAKES THE GOOD-HEARTED DECISION OF LETTING GOLLUM LIVE IT'S FRUSTRATING TO US BUT A MASTER STROKE BY FRODO BECAUSE IN THE END THE RING WAS TOO POWERFUL FOR HIM GOLLUM BEING ALIVE AND STEALING THE RING AT THE END ENSURES THE RINGS DESTRUCTION POSSIBLY AN ACT OF ERU

AN ANALYSIS OF USE OF THE SONG OF ROLAND AND HOW IT ADDS TO HIS DEPICTION ON CHRISTIAN KNIGHTHOOD IT IS PART ONE OF TWO WITH THE SECOND FOCUSING ON HOW PETER MOVIE VERSION EXPANDS ON ORIGINAL USAGE
HERE IS PART TWO PRIMARILY DISCUSSING THE FILM ADAPTATION OF THE TWO TOWERS
AND MANY OF THESE WOULD HAVE RUINED THE FILMS IMO NOT THE THINGS THE ACTORS OR WOMEN IN BEARDS BUT THINGS LIKE KILLING A HOBBIT BECAUSE ONE SIMPLY SHOULD DIE ARAGON FIGHTING SARON THESE KIND OF THINGS

I DIDN'T KNOW THOUGH VERY PROUD OF JACKSON FOR THAT
VERY NICE TO READ

IF I HAD NEEDED ANY FURTHER PROOF THAT THE MAKERS OF THE MOVIES HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE BOOKS ARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY FILMED A SCENE WHERE ARAGON FIGHTS SARON AND IN THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT FRODO KILLED GOLLUM WOULD HAVE NICELY DELIVERED
MAN WHAT A SHIT SHOW MANY OF THESE WOULD HAVE MADE FOR EXCEPT LIAM NEESON HE COULD HAVE BEEN COOL IN A FEW DIFFERENT ROLES ELROD GANDALF FARAMIR BOOK FARAMIR
GLAD NEVER HAPPENED
I THINK THEY HAD SOME REDEEMING QUALITIES AND AREN'T PARTICULARLY BAD FILMS IT'S JUST THAT THEY ARE NOWHERE NEAR THE ORIGINAL LOAR TRILOGY
THE HOBBIT MOVIES WERE JUST REALLY BORING NOT AWFUL MOVIES JUST BLOATED BORING ONES EVERYTHING FOLLOWING BILBO WAS GOOD AND THE REST JUST FELT LIKE FAT TOO LITTLE BUTTER OVER TOO MUCH BREAD


I THINK THE LOAR ARE FAR SUPERIOR IN EVERY ASPECT OF FILMMAKING AND AESTHETIC HOWEVER THATS NOT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE HOBBIT I REALLY DID ENJOY THEM IT'S JUST I WATCH THE HOBBIT AND THINK OF THINGS I'D HAVE PREFERED TO BE IN OR NOT OR LOOK DIFFERENT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH LOAR
I LIKE THE CHARACTERS THE ACTORS THEY GOT FOR THEM THE MUSIC MOST OF THE VISUALS AND THE BOOK SCENES LIKE THE UNEXPECTED PARTY RIDDLES IN THE DARK ETC BUT HONESTLY I WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD PETE HE COULDN'T DO A TRILOGY IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH ADDED MATERIAL AND NONE OF IT WAS NECESSARY
THEY WERE OKAY BUT TOO LONG REALLY WELL CAST THOUGH I LIKE THE FIRST ONE MOST FOR THE RIDDLES IN THE DARK SCENE AND ANY SCENES IN THE SHIRE ARE PRETTY GOOD
AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY WAS OK NOT GREAT BUT PASSABLE DESOLATION OF SMUG WAS A SIGNIFICANT STEP DOWN BUT STILL AT LEAST WATCHABLE ALTHOUGH ONLY BARELY THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MOVIE IN EXISTENCE THAT I DESPISE MORE THAN THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES

IT'S A DISGRACE AN ABSOLUTE COMPREHENSIVE SWEEPING FAILURE IN ALL ASPECTS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO REDEEMING QUALITIES IT TAKES A GIANT STEAMING SHIT ON EVERYTHING THAT BOOK EVER STOOD FOR THE LARGER THEME AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WORK IS COMPLETELY LOST IN THE INANITY OF SOULLESS STUPID AND INCOMPREHENSIBLY MEDIOCRE ACTION

BOF ISN'T EVEN RECOGNIZABLE FROM THE SOURCE MATERIAL THE TITULAR CHARACTER BILBO THE HOBBIT IS REDUCED TO A SECONDARY CHARACTER AT BEST AND MAYBE EVEN A TERTIARY ONE ALL ASPECTS OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT PLOT ADVANCEMENT OR INTRIGUING DIALOGUE ARE REPLACED WITH AN HOUR AND A HALF OF NONSENSE ANY ASPECT OF ESTABLISHED LORE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED FOR THE MOVIES WAS ULTIMATELY THROWN OUT THE WINDOW AND REPLACED WITH ABSOLUTELY WHATEVER THE LIVING FUCK PETER JACKSON COULD COME UP WITH ON THE SPOT I MEAN FOR SHITS SAKE THIS IS ARDA NOT ARRACKS WE DON'T HAVE FUCKING SANDWORMS

AND EVEN IF ONE WERE TO COMPLETELY DISREGARD THE SOURCE MATERIAL IT'S A TERRIBLE MOVIE IN AND OF ITSELF THE ACTION IS SO COMICALLY CHEESY THAT IT WOULD NOT BE PARTICULARLY OUT OF PLACE IN A SO BAD IT'S GOOD S KUNG FU FLICK THE PACING IS AN ABSOLUTE CATASTROPHE THAT IS UTTERLY FUCKED FROM THE IT STARTS OFF WITH WHAT ANY REASONABLE DIRECTOR WOULD HAVE PLACED AS THE CLIMAX OF AN EARLIER MOVIE SLOWS DOWN FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND THEN IMMEDIATELY JUMPS INTO A TANGENTIAL ACTION SCENE THAT HAS LITTLE TO NO BEARING ON THE REST OF THE EVENTS OF THE MOVIE FOLLOWING THAT WE DIVE IMMEDIATELY INTO AN HOUR LONG SHIFTIEST OF A BATTLE THAT WOULD GIVE EVEN THE MOST INEBRIATED PERSON ON THE PLANET A DIFFICULT TIME MAINTAINING ANY LEVEL OF SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF

IN ISOLATION THE HOBBIT TRILOGY IS MEDIOCRE VERGING ON BAD IN COMPARISON TO EARLY WORK IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS THEY ARE AWFUL AND FINALLY IF ONE ATTEMPTS TO DRAW ANY LEVEL OF COMPARISON BETWEEN THE SOURCE MATERIAL THAN THESE MOVIES WERE NOTHING SHORT OF A TRAGIC DISGRACE AN UTTER ABOMINATION THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY

I DEFY ANYONE TO ATTEMPT TO DEFEND SCENES LIKE THIS


WATCH V


I HATED IT UTTERLY
THERE ARE A FAIR NUMBER OF REASONS

FIRST AND FOREMOST MOST OF US ARE LOOKING AT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ADAPTATION THE HOBBIT IS ONLY ABOUT HALF THE LENGTH OF FELLOWSHIP LET ALONE THE WHOLE LOAR TRILOGY SO EXPANDING A SHORT BOOK INTO A LONG TRILOGY MEANS A LOT OF BLOAT

2 EXCESSIVE USE OF MEDIOCRE CGI THE ORIGINALS WERE WIDELY PRAISED FOR THEIR PRACTICAL EFFECTS USING ACTUAL SETS BRILLIANT CINEMATOGRAPHY AND ARGUABLY THE BEST COSTUME AND MAKEUP WORK IN ANY MOVIE EVER THIS MEANS THAT DESPITE CG TECHNOLOGY BEING FAR FAR WORSE WHEN LOAR WAS MADE IT LOOKED MUCH MORE REAL WITH EXCEPTIONS OF COURSE LOAR CG WAS MOSTLY FOR THE DISTANT BACKGROUNDS OR THINGS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO PRACTICALLY WHILE THE HOBBIT USED IT FOR BASICALLY EVERYTHING TO PROVE MY POINT COMPARE HOW AGOG THE HOBBIT ANTAGONIST COMPARES TO GENERIC ORCS FROM LOAR HINT FAKE

I DON'T REMEMBER HIS NAME BUT THAT GUY WHO WORKS FOR THE MASTER OF LAKE TOWN HOLY HELL HE WAS TERRIBLE LIKE ENOUGH TO PUT JAR JAR BANKS TO SHAME I REALLY CAN'T OVERSTATE HOW MUCH I HATE HIM

ACTION SCENES THE BARRELS OUT OF BOND ESPECIALLY BOMBOUS THE ESCAPE FROM GOBLIN TOWN FREAKING ETC THE MOVIE CERTAINLY HAD ITS FAIR SHARE OF EXCELLENT ACTION SCENES BUT SOME I JUST CAN'T HELP GROANING AT

POINTLESS FILLER WHY DID THEY NEED TO WASTE ALL THAT TIME WITH F K INJURY AND AN ORC INVASION OF LAKE TOWN TO PUSH A HALFHEARTED LOVE STORY AND FILL UP TIME REMEMBER WHEN THE DWARVES HAD A SCOOBY DOO HEY LOOK OVER HERE SMUG CHASE SCENE NOT TO MENTION THE CHASE RIGHT BEFORE RIVENDELL

THE ELVES JUMPING OVER THE DWARVES SHIELD WALL DURING THE BFA HONESTLY THEY HAVE SUCH A KICKLESS SHIELD WALL GOING WITH WHO KNOWS HOW MANY ELDEN ARCHERS BEHIND IT AND THEY DECIDE TO JUMP OVER IT IT'S THE STUPIDEST IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD JUST SO THEY COULD GET A DRAMATIC SHOT IN UGH

THE WORMS THIS ISN'T DUNE WHY DID THEY NEED WORMS COULDN'T THE WORMS JUST KILL THE ELVES DWARVES AND MEN FOR THEM WHERE WERE THESE WORMS DURING LOAR IT MAKES NO SENSE UGH AGAIN
FOLKS DON'T REALLY OBJECT TO THE MOVIES IT'S JUST THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM UNDER ALL THAT PADDING UNDERNEATH THAT BLOATED MONSTER IS A SWEET LITHE FILM JUST BEGGING TO GET OUT
DELETED
MY DREAM ONE DAY IS TO SEE THE PLOT OF THE ORIGINAL HOBBIT AS DISPLAYED IN THE CARTOON VERSION ON THE BIG SCREEN WITH THE VISION AND BUDGET OF A PETER JACKSON LOAR FILM NO EXTRA FAT OR BULLSHIT
TOO LONG BAD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT I NEVER EVEN REMEMBERED ALL THE DWARVES ATH AND JUST MINDLESS ACTION ITS LIKE THE STAR WARS PREQUEL
TO ME THE HOBBIT TRILOGY FLESHES OUT THE WORLD OF MIDDLE-EARTH ON FILM AND QUENCHES THE THIRST FOR MORE LORD OF THE RINGS IS OF COURSE THE BETTER TRILOGY

I THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR SETBACKS OF THE HOBBIT FILMS IS IT'S HEAVY RELIANCE ON CGI WHICH MAKES IT FEEL CHEAP AND ALREADY DATED SURE THERE'S EVEN MORE DATED THINGS IN LORD OF THE RINGS PERGOLAS SWINGING UP IN HIS HORSE HALACHA BUT MY IMPRESSION IS THERE'S MORE PRACTICAL EFFECTS IN THE RINGS
MY MAIN BEEF WITH THE HOBBIT TRILOGY IS THE PORTRAYAL OF THE DWARVES THEY ALL FEEL CARTOONIST EXCEPT FOR THORIN WHO FEELS LIKE A SMALL MAN INSTEAD OF A DWARF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAME OUT OF SNOW WHITE NOT MIDDLE EARTH
I WAS JUST WATCHING ADJ AND IT'S REALLY NOT THAT GOOD VISUALLY LESS STUNNING AND COHESIVE THAN THE FIRST TRILOGY THEY TRIED SOMETHING MORE COLORFUL BUT IT DOESN'T HOLD THAT WELL TOGETHER THE STORY FEELS LIKE AN ALTERNATE VERSION OF FOR THEY CHECK MOST OF THE SAME BOXES I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT IS IN THE BOOK BUT SINCE THE MOVIE ISN'T BRILLIANT IN IT'S REALISATION OR ORIGINAL IT FEELS MPH

MAYBE A SMALLER BUDGET WOULD HAVE MADE THINGS WORK BETTER IT'S STILL NICE TO COME BACK TO MIDDLE EARTH THE MOVIE DOESN'T REALLY FOCUS ON BILBO AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING IN ITSELF BUT IT ISN'T WELL EXECUTED IT'S NOT BROUT RIGHTFULLY AND THE MOVIE SWITCH TONES WITHOUT TUNE IT JUST COMES AND GOES IN A WAY WELL I WANTED TO SEE THE DRAGON SO I'M ON MY WAY TO WATCH DESOLATION OF SMUG
WELL THAT GRAPH ASSUMES THAT THE PEOPLE BILBO KNOWS HALF AS WELL AS HE SHOULD LIKE AND THE PEOPLE HE LIKES HALF AS WELL AS THEY DESERVE ARE DISJUNCT GROUPS WHICH I DON'T THINK IS NECESSARILY GIVEN FROM THE QUOTE
HERE'S A BETTER GRAPH

EDIT THE LINE I LIKE LESS THAN HALF OF YOU HALF AS WELL AS YOU DESERVE CAN BE SEEN AS A SUBSET OF THE FIRST GROUP THE PEOPLE HE KNOWS IF HE KNOWS HALF OF THEM THEN THIS IS WHY HE LIKES LESS THAN HALF OF THEM SO OF THE PEOPLE HE KNOWS HE DOES NOT LIKE ALL OF THEM AS MUCH AS THEY DESERVE
REPHRASED I WISH I KNEW MORE OF YOU PEOPLE BUT I ONLY KNOW HALF OF YOU AND THAT HALF I DO LIKE I LIKE THEM LESS THAN THEY DESERVE
AND HE LIKES LESS THAN HALF OF THEM HALF AS WELL AS THEY DESERVE THE CHART IS FLAWED
I DON'T KNOW HALF OF YOU HALF AS WELL AS I SHOULD LIKE AND I LIKE LESS THAN HALF OF YOU HALF AS WELL AS YOU DESERVE
AWESOME BUT HERE'S A MORE ACCURATE DEPICTION
THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR R THEYDIDTHEMATH
CHEMISTRY THERMODYNAMICS OR MATERIAL SCIENCE
PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY
I KNOW ALL OR MOST OF YOU OR SOME OF YOU OR NONE OF YOU I'M NOT PRECISE HERE OR SPEAKING LOOSELY ARE ENGAGED IN PERSONAL MENTAL MASTURBATION BUT WHY SHOULD WE ASSUME BILBO USES HALF MATHEMATICALLY LITERALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF HIS COMMENT IN THE BOOK

SOMETIMES IN ENGLISH THE WORD SEMI ALTHOUGH LATIN FOR HALF IS THROWN AROUND WITH IMPRECISION AS PARTIALLY OR INCOMPLETELY
I LAUGHED EMPHATICALLY AT THIS ELEVENTYONE YEARS OLD
TOM BOBADIL VS THE BURROW WIGHTS
IN THE MOVIES THE OATHBREAKERS TAKE AWAY THE VICTORY OF MEN THEREFORE I THINK THE BATTLE OF DEEP IS BETTER
THE UNNUMBERED TEARS BOOKS
I LOVE THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR RIGHT UP UNTIL THE DEAD MEN OF DUNHARROW ARRIVE THAT SCENE TO ME IS HONESTLY PETER GREATEST IN THE TRILOGY
HELMS DEEP FOR ME I GET THAT PELENNOR WAS A CULMINATION OF IT ALL
BUT DEEP WAS GRITTY AND SO ROOTED AND CONNECTED TO BASIC HUMAN EMOTION IN THE MOVIE THEOWMEN RIDING OUT ELVES COMING TO HELP THE THREE OF THE FELLOWSHIP LOOKING AFTER EACH OTHER AND THEN THE UNCATASTROPHIC NATURE OF GANDALF RIDING DOWN
THROW IN THE LIL BITS WHERE SAM TALKS ABOUT THE GREAT STORIES AND MUSIC I AM GIVING MYSELF GOOSEBUMPS

PELENNOR WITH PIPPIN AND ELWYN HAD ITS AMAZING MOMENTS TOO
PELENNOR NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THE SHEER AWESOMENESS OF THE ROHIRRIM CHARGING DOWN THE HOST OF MORDOR IS JUST AMAZING THE CHARGE OF THE MUMAKIL IS CHILLING AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE BLACK SHIPS IS THE CLIMAX WHERE THE KING RETURNS AND SAVES THE WHITE CITY FROM DOOM

THE BATTLE OF THE HORNBURG IS IN MANY WAYS A PRELUDE OR PRECURSOR TO THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR AND WHILE GOOD IS NOT NEARLY AS EPIC
HELMS DEEP
PROBABLY HELMS DEEP BECAUSE IT WAS VERY PERSONAL BUT I THINK PELENNOR HAD ACTUALLY BETTER FIGHT SCENES RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY SCENE WITH THE OLIPHAUNTS WERE BADASS
THE CHARGE OF THE ROHIRRIM IS MY FAVORITE SCENE EVER

SO MUCH EPICENES
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE BATTLE OF HELMS DEEP BEST BECAUSE OF THE STORYLINE OF TIED DIRECTLY TO SAURURAN
THE LORD OF THE RINGS ONLINE
LOAR BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH 2 REAL TIME STRATEGY
LEGO LORD OF THE RINGS
MINECRAFT SERVER ISNT REALLY A LOAR GAME BUT AN AMAZING REPRESENTENTATION OF MIDDLE EARTH
LOAR CONQUEST
LOAR CONQUEST
I LOVED THE EA TWO TOWERS AND RETURN OF THE KING GAMES THEY DID A GREAT JOB CAPTURING THE FEEL OF THE FILMS EXCELLENT SOUND DESIGN PLUS HOWARD SHORE'S SCORE AND THE GRAPHICS WERE GREAT FOR THE TIME THE GAMEPLAY WAS HACK AND SLASH ON RAILS BUT IT WAS DONE WELL AND YOU KNOW IT WAS LOAR
SIL

2 TALES OF MIDDLE EARTH 2 TOME 2

THE LORD OF THE RINGS VOLUME

THE WAR OF THE RING BOARDGAME

LORD OF THE RINGS THE CONFRONTATION BOARD GAME

RETURN OF THE KING WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES GROWING UP I WAS NOT A FAN OF THE COMBAT SYSTEM IN THE OTHER LOAR GAMES THO
ANYONE REMEMBER WAR IN MIDDLE EARTH THE STRATEGY GAME FROM WAY BACK IN THE

MY BROTHER AND I WOULD SPEND HOURS PLAYING THAT GAME PRIMITIVE BY STANDARDS OF COURSE BUT GREAT FUN AT THE TIME
THE HOBBIT IS MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME
THE MOD THIRD AGE FOR MEDIEVAL 2 TOTAL WAR IS EXCELLENT
WELL IT'S NOT A VIDEO GAME BUT LOAR RISK IS FUCKING FANTASTIC OH AND UH LATRO
THE LAST DAYS OF MIDDLE-EARTH MOD FOR MOUNT AND BLADE WARRAND
SERVANTS OF THE OF INGMAR
HE LIVED OFF THE MONEY EARNED BY HIS ANCESTORS LIKE THE GREAT TOOK
BILBO WAS LANDED GENTRY AND HIS BEING SO WAS A RATHER IMPORTANT PART OF THE HOBBIT IF HE WAS MORE INDUSTRIOUS AND HARD WORKING THEN HIS CHARACTER WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED WITH THE PLOT HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A BIT CLUELESS AND BOURGEOIS SILK HANDKERCHIEFS AND MISSING HIS BED SITTING AROUND ALL DAY BLOWING SMOKE RINGS AND EATING NUMEROUS MEALS
BILBO IS AN OLD MONEY HOBBIT
ALL OF THE HOBBITS THAT ARE PRIMARY CHARACTERS IN THE STORY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SAM ARE VERY MUCH MEMBERS OF THE GENTRY I DOUBT BILBO FRODO MERRY OR PIPPIN EVER HAD TO WORK IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO
FAMILY MONEY
FAMILY MONEY
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT GANDALF WOULD WIPE THE FLOOR WITH MALEFICENT
CURRENTLY GANDALF IS WINNING 2
THE ALAR DECIDE THAT ITS PROBABLY BEST FOR MIDDLE EARTH FOR THEM TO NOT INTERVENE THE WANT TO LEAVE THE WORLD IN THE HANDS OF THE CHILDREN OF ILLUVATAR AND NOT GOVERN OVER THEM

GALADRIEL LIKE MOST OF THE NOLUDAR RECEIVE PARDON ON THE DOOM OF BANDOS AFTER THE WAR OF THE WRATH AND ARE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO ALIENOR HOWEVER SHE DOES HESITATE STILL DESIRING TO RULE IN MIDDLE EARTH FOR A WHILE ONCE REFUSING THE RING SHE DECIDES THAT SHE HAS PROVEN HERSELF AND IS READY AND WILLING TO RETURN TO ALIENOR
ON THE MATTER OF GALADRIEL

WHILE HER HISTORY IS COMPLICATED AND CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES DURING WRITING IT IS CLEAR THAT SHE HAD NO PART IN THE KINSLAYING
TZOLKIN MADE THIS CLEARER THE MORE HE REWORKED HER HISTORY AT SOME POINT HE WROTE THAT SHE FOUGHT FIERCELY AGAINST FËANOR IN DEFENCE OF HER MOTHER S KIN HER MOTHER BEING THE DAUGHTER OF KING OLWM OF ALQUALONDË

LATER ACCORDING TO CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN IN POSSIBLY HIS THE LAST WRITING ON MIDDLE-EARTH HE REVISED HER STORY ONCE MORE THIS TIME SHE WAS COMPLETELY UNINVOLVED WITH REBELLION FIGHTING AGAINST HIM AT ALQUALONDË ALONGSIDE CELEBORN AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEPARTING ALIENOR WITH THE LATTER
THAT'S MY PLAN BUY A NICE BIG PLOT OF LAND WITH A NORMAL BUT NICE HOUSE ABOVE GROUND THEN BUILD AN EARTHSHINE HOBBIT HOLE AS MY HIDEAWAY AND A CONVERTED BARN FOR MY NANOBREWERY PERSONAL PUB

I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT
I WOULD ABSOLUTELY DO THIS TOO BUT WITH A SECRET DOOR THAT LED TO SOME MORE AREAS LOL GOTTA HAVE A BIG HOME THEATER FOR WATCHING LOAR RIGHT
THE TWO AREN'T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THINK OF BRANDY HALL OR THE GREAT SIALS
AGREED BUT I WOULD ALSO USE A MOUNTAIN INSTEAD OF A HILL AND WOULD BUILD THE EQUIVALENT OF A MANSION INSIDE SAID MOUNTAIN

BONUS POINTS IF I CAN FIND AND BUY AN ACTIVE VOLCANO
IF THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT HILL WAS A WALL OF WINDOWS I'D LOVE IT OTHERWISE THE LACK OF SUNLIGHT WOULD REALLY GET ME DOWN
I THINK WE ALL WOULD WITH A SECRET PASSAGE TO THE GIANT TOWER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL
THE HOBBIT A FUN IDEA BUT I THINK REALISTICALLY I'D JUST GET SOME TINY SUBURBAN SINGLE HOUSE IN A REASONABLE UNREMARKABLE AREA PAY IT OFF AND THEN LIVE AN EASY MODEST LIFE OF LETHARGY AND READING AND GAMING WITH WEEKEND TRIPS TO THE GOOD RESTAURANTS IN THE NEAREST CITY I'D TOTALLY LIVE LIKE A HOBBIT JUST NOT LITERALLY

GUESS IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY MILLIONS MILLIONAIRE ENTAILS
EVEN PEOPLE WHO BUY HUGE HOUSES END UP SLEEPING AND SPENDING MOST OF THEIR TIME IN A ROUGHLY FOOT SPACE WE HAVE THIS CAVE MAN LEVEL INSTINCT TO JUST HAVE A SMALL COMFY COZY SPOT AND THATS WHAT MAKES US HAPPY
THIS WOULD BE SO AWESOME
I STARTED READING LOAR FOR THE FIRST TIME RECENTLY AND THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE THE SHIRE HAS CONVINCED ME TO MOVE OUT OF THE CITY TO S NICE WEE HOSE OUT IN A VILLAGE
KINDA UNRELATED BUT WE'RE HAVING ELECTIONS HERE IN BRAZIL AND LAST WEEK I VOTED IN A HOBBIT HOLE HTTPS
MILLIONAIRES DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE MANSIONS OR HOBBIT HOLES LOL A MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS IN A HELL OF A LOT LESS THAN YOU'D THINK
I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE A HOBBIT HOLE HOUSE AND THEN IN THE BACKYARD THERE WOULD BE A LOTHLORIEN INSPIRED GREENHOUSE I'D ALSO HAVE REPLICAS OF ALL THE SWORDS AND A PONY NAMED BILL SOMETIMES I WOULD DRESS UP LIKE GANDALF AND TAKE A CARRIAGE DRAWN BY BILL AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD JUST TO MESS WITH PEOPLE
AS A RESIDENT OF THE SOUTH EAST USA SUBTERRANEAN LIVING SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFECT SOLUTION TO THE RIDICULOUS HEAT
IF YOU BUILD IT YOU'LL INVITE ALL OF US RIGHT
IF YOU WEREN'T LAZY AF YOU COULD PROBABLY BUILD THAT FOR ABOUT K THE COST OF THE LAND

I'M TOO TALL I'D GO FOR SOMETHING LIKE ORTHANT NOW IF I CAN ONLY FIND THE REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT VOLCANO AND SOME GOOD NUMENOREAN WORKERS
BUT WITH HIGHER CEILINGS
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE RICHARD YOU JUST NEED TIME AND A LITTLE LAND


I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A HOBBIT HOUSE
A NICE SIZED HOBBIT HOLE EQUIP WITH A STUDY LIBRARY WITH A FIREPLACE A TROPHY ROOM FROM HUNTING A FULLY DECKED OUT KITCHEN A BEDROOM AND A TELEVISION
NOT IF WHEN

FUCKING BELIEVE IN YOURSELF
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO BE A MILLIONAIRE TO HAVE THIS
BUT THESE ARE MANSIONS JUST UNDERGROUND
I FEEL LIKE IN REAL LIFE EROSION WOULD BE A HUGE ISSUE FOR THE HOUSE IN THE LONG TERM
TOO
FUCKING PEASANTS
THIS HAS BEEN MY IDEA AS WELL THOUGH I WAS THINKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF A BUNCH OF HOBBIT HOLES OF COURSE FOR A FEW CHOICE FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO LIVE NEARBY GOTTA DREAM BIG RIGHT
SERIOUSLY COZY IS WHERE IT'S AT PEOPLE WHO BUY BIG GRAND ECHO CHAMBERS ARE DOING IT WRONG
TWO WORDS SEX DUNGEON
TO BE FAIR A HOBBIT HOLE IS JUST AN UNDERGROUND MANSION
MATAMATA NEW ZEALAND
I WOULD BUILD A SECRET

MAYBE MAKE THE ENTRANCE LOOK LIKE A HOBBIT HOLE FOR DISGUISE
SO WHO WANTS INVEST IN A GIANT PIECE OF LAND AND CREATE OUR DREAM HOMES AND FORM A COMMUNITY I MAY HAVE DREAMED ABOUT THIS HAPPENING
DELETED
DELETED
I AUDIBLY GASPED SO BEAUTIFUL
THAT'S THE ONE I HAVE BE CAREFUL NOT TO RIP THE MAPS
NICE I BOUGHT THAT ONE YEARS AGO NOW AND AM READING IT FOR THE 4TH TIME NOW
I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE
IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET ALL THREE LIKE THAT
I'VE ALWAYS PREFERED THE HARPER COLINS PUBLISHED SPECIAL EDITIONS BUT THAT EDITIONS IS GORGEOUS
HERE TWO SEESAWS ARE BEING FABRICATED I DO NOT RECALL SEEING THESE IN THE HOBBIT MOVIES IN THE BACKGROUND THE GREEN DRAGON IS BEING BUILT WHICH IS NOW A REAL TAVERN AND THE PARTY TREE IS SEEN AT THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE IMAGE
THIS IS PRETTY AWESOME

YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY I GREW UP WITH THE ATLAS OF MIDDLE EARTH WHICH DEPICTS THE WALLS AND A VERY FEW BUILDINGS IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME UNTIL I SAW THE MOVIE THAT THERE WOULD BE A MYRIAD OF BUILDINGS IN THE SPACE BETWEEN EACH LEVEL AFTER WHICH IT SEEMED OBVIOUS
SO I WAS LOOKING FOR A DECENT MINAS TIGRISH WALLPAPER AND STUMBLED UPON THIS MAP ON GOOGLE IMAGES OBVIOUSLY IT HAS ALREADY BEEN POSTED ONCE 2 YEARS AGO I DIDN'T SEE IT BEFORE THO AND I FIGURED SOME OF YOU GUYS DIDN'T EITHER SO I HOPE YOU'LL FIND IT AS INTERESTING AS ME

OBVIOUSLY MOST OF IT IS MADE UP THO
WOW THAT'S PRETTY NEAT

MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE SOURCE
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MAPS LIKE THESE REALLY WISH I COULD FIND MORE SAW YOU POSTED A SOURCE MAY HAVE TO INVEST
IT GETS EVEN BETTER FROM FAR AWAY IT'LL LOOK LIKE HOBBIT FOOT HAIR
IT'S A DANGEROUS BUSINESS U WUTTHEFOLK GOING OUT YOUR DOOR AND IF YOU DON'T KEEP YOUR FEET THERE'S NO KNOWING WHERE YOU MIGHT BE SWEPT OFF TO
I LIKE THIS
THIS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE I'M SURE IT WILL END UP ON SOMEONE'S BACK ARM LEGEND
NICE SKETCH AND GO HAWKS
INKTOBER
HE LOOKS A BIT CRANKY BUT GOOD SKETCH ALL THE SAME
LOOKS QUITE NICE THANK YOU
I WOULD SAY NICE BUT MY CURRENT LOCATION FORBIDS ME FROM COMPLIMENTING A HAWKEYE
THANKS ALL FOR THE KIND REMARKS I DID THIS PRETTY QUICKLY SHOWN BY THE SLOPPY SHADOWFAX SO IM GOING TO TUNE IT UP AND MAY TURN IT IN TO PRINTS IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED
COOL MINIMALIST DRAWING IN CASE ANYONE WAS WONDERING AITH TRANSLATES TO GREY AND RANDIR TRANSLATES TO WANDERER PILGRIM IN THE SINDARIN LANGUAGE MITHRANDIR WAS A NAME GIVEN TO GANDALF BY THE ELVES GANDALF LITERALLY TRANSLATES TO WAND ELF IN OLD NORSE BUT I DON'T RECALL WHO FIRST CALLED HIM GANDALF IN THE BOOKS GANDALFS REAL NAME IN HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE MALARIN IS COLORIN WHICH IS RELATED TO THE MALARIN WORD BOLOS WHICH MEANS DREAM
VERY NICE TABLE LOOKED LIKE A LOT OF WORK YOU SHOULD SEND THIS OVER TO R DIY
SO I SKIPPED OVER THIS POST SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE IT WASN'T GETTING MUCH ATTENTION AND FIGURED IT WAS BUSH LEAGUE

BUT HOLY SHIT

THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL TABLE AND AN EVEN BETTER POST I'D KILL TO HAVE A TABLE LIKE THAT OR EVEN THE SKILLS TO MAKE SOMETHING SO COOL NICE WORK
CONCERNING HOBBITS IS THE BEST SONG IMO
FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED TO GO LISTEN TO THE REST RIGHT NOW

MY FAVORITE IS THE THEME OF CONDOR DURING THE RETURN OF THE KING

I ALSO REALLY LOVE FAR OVER MISTY MOUNTAINS COLD FROM THE HOBBIT
I LOVE THE HARDANGER FIDDLE MUSIC FROM ROHAN
DEFINITELY THE LIGHTING OF THE BEACONS THE BRASS AND STRINGS WORK TOGETHER SO WELL IN THAT SONG THAT IT ALMOST BRINGS ME TO TEARS ALSO PAIRS WELL WITH THE SCENE IN ROK HOWARD SHORE IS A GENIUS
THE SOUNDTRACK IN MORIA IS SOME OF THE BEST IN THE WHOLE TRILOGY JOURNEY IN THE DARK DOES A GREAT JOB OF CONVEYING THE UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR OF THE FELLOWSHIP THEN WHEN THEY SEE DWARROWDELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IT RISES TO THIS AWE-INSPIRING CRESCENDO THAT MIRRORS THE LOOKS OF AMAZEMENT ON THE MEMBERS OF THE FELLOWSHIP
MY FAVOURITE IS FAREWELL TO LORIEN THE MUSIC IS JUST SO SURREAL AND SAD AS IF IT TELLS THE TALE OF THE ELVES FROM FËANOR AND THE SILMARILS UNTIL THEIR LAST DAYS IN MIDDLE-EARTH
THE ONE THATS PLAYED MOSTLY WHEN THE MOVIE FOLLOWS GIMLI AND PERGOLAS IN ROHAN AND CONDOR
THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP EPITOMIZES THE TRILOGY FOR ME
FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING IT HAS LOVELY TUNES FOR ALL MY FAVOURITE MIDDLE EARTH LOCATIONS

CONCERNING HOBBITS IS PROBABLY MY VERY FAVOURITE TRACK
THE MOVIE WOULD BE ROK INDIVIDUAL TRACK IS LIGHTING OF THE BEACONS
BEST OF LUCK
GOD THE HOBBIT MOVIES SUCKED
END ALWAYS FELT ONE OF THE WORST THINGS IN THE SILMARILLION FOR ME
THE ARTIST
YEAH EVEN IF I SQUINT REALLY HARD AND IMAGINE IT'S DARK I'M STILL NOT SOLD TURIN COULD MISTAKE THIS GUY FOR AN ORC THAT SCENE JUST KILLS ME EVERY TIME I READ IT BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPLAUSIBLE IT'S PROBABLY REALISTIC IF THAT MAKES SENSE SOMEBODY MISTAKING THEIR FRIEND FOR AN ENEMY IT'S SO TURIN IT HURTS
JUST AS TZOLKIN PICTURED IT NO DOUBT I LOVE IT
ITS NO BETTER THAN FAN FICTION
NOT EVEN SLIGHTLY ACCURATE IT'S A FUN GAME BUT IN TERMS OF LORE IT'S ENTIRELY MADE-UP BULLSHIT
IT'S NOT ACCURATE IN THE SLIGHTEST THE WHOLE PLOT IS MADE UP FROM SCRATCH SOME OF THE COLLECTIBLES HAVE BACKSTORIES BUT OF THE GAME ISN'T MIDDLE-EARTH AT ALL
NOTHING IN THAT GAME IS LORE ACCURATE
IN THE REAL LORE CELEBRIMBOR IS DEFEATED AFTER SARON REALIZES THE ELVES KNOW ABOUT HIS RING AND WAGES WAR ON THEIR PROLINES IN REGION I DON'T KNOW IF HIS DEMISE IS EVER DESCRIBED BUT NOTHING REMOTELY CLOSE TO SOMERSET
SEEMS TO BE THE OVERWHELMING ANSWER I'M GETTING THE ARTIFACTS WERE A NICE TOUCH THOUGH I MUST SAY ONE OF VERY FEW GAME GRINDING COLLECTIBLES WORTH FINDING FIND IT STRANGE HOW THE DEVS MADE IT LOOK LIKE CELEBRIMBOR HELPED MAKE THE ACTUAL ONE RING BECAUSE EVERYONE IS SAYING HE SIMPLY MADE THE OTHER RINGS OF POWER AND THAT SARON HIMSELF AND ONLY HIMSELF MADE THE ONE
UNBELIEVABLY SHITTY FAN FICTION
SO THEY ACTUALLY SETTLED IN MORDOR ALONGSIDE SARON SEEMS WEIRD TO THINK OF MORDOR AS ANYTHING BUT AN EVIL BREEDING GROUND WASTELAND I IMAGINE IF HE HAD CONVINCED THEM TO SIDE WITH HIM RATHER THAN DESTROY THEM MORDOR AND THE WHOLE OF MIDDLE EARTH WOULD OF BEEN A PRETTY DIFFERENT PICTURE I WISH BACK WERE TOLD IN MORE DETAIL A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAUSED MASSIVE STORY DEVELOPMENTS ARE SO VAGUE IN HIS WORK
THE FIRST BOOK I GOT WHEN I WAS WAS LOAR HISTORY AND WARFARE AND IT TOLD OF HOW MANY GONDORIAN OUTPOSTS AND CITIES WERE CONQUERED THE GAME IS ALSO SKETCHY ON THIS AS IT ONLY COVERS THE FALL OF THE BLACK GATE WHICH IS ANNOYING WOULD BE INTERESTING TO GET A DEPICTION OF MINAS MOGUL AND THE LIKES BEING CAPTURED MORDOR IS SO VAST THOUGH SO I GUESS IT WOULD BE HARD TO SHOW THE WHOLE MAP ONE NICE DETAIL HOWEVER IS LOCAL SLAVES FROM BURN TALK ABOUT A TOWER BEING REBORN FROM THE ASHES WHICH IS A NICE HINT AT BEING REBUILT DURING THAT POINT IN TIME
HALF A MCGUFFIN

THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF A MCGUFFIN IS THAT IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING AND IS IMPORTANT ONLY IN THAT EVERYBODY WANTS IT

IN THE HANDS OF FRODO THE RING DIDN'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT MAKE EVERYBODY WANT IT

BUT IN THE HANDS OF SARON OR ANYONE WITH SIGNIFICANT POWER IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY DO SOMETHING WHICH IS PART OF WHY EVERYBODY WANTED IT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A GOLDEN SNITCH GAIN POSSESSION OF THIS PLOT DEVICE AND YOU INSTANTLY WIN BUT IT SERVES A SPECIFIC PURPOSE

SO IN EFFECT THE RING IS NOT A MCGUFFIN BECAUSE ITS IMPORTANCE IS EXPLAINED BUT IT FUNCTIONS LIKE A MCGUFFIN WITHIN THE NARRATIVE SINCE IT HAS NO USEFULNESS TO THE PERSON CARRYING IT

AND THEN TO COMPLICATE THINGS FURTHER SAM USES IT THE SAME WAY BILBO DID IN THE HOBBIT WHERE IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT A MCGUFFIN

SO LONG STORY SHORT TOO LATE

ANSWER NO NOT REALLY TOO MUCH INFORMATION AND UTILITY

ANSWER 2 USUALLY IT IS BUT NOT ALWAYS
SWORN THIS READ IS THE ONE RING A MCMUFFIN

MMM ONE BREAKFAST ITEM TO RULE THEM ALL
ISN'T A MACGUFFIN DEFINED BY BEING SEEMINGLY IMPORTANT WITHOUT A PROPER NARRATIVE EXPLANATION IT IS VERY CLEARLY ESTABLISHED WHY THE ONE RING IS CENTRAL TO THE STORY
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ANSWERED YOUR OWN QUESTION
YOUR QUESTION HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED AN EXAMPLE OF A MACGUFFIN WOULD BE THE BRIEFCASE FROM PULP FICTION
ISN'T A MCGUFFIN USUALLY SOMETHING THE PROTAGONISTS ARE TRYING TO GET THE RING IS SOMETHING THEY'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF

ALSO THE RING IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE THEMES OF POWER AND CONTROL THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE MYTHOS SO DEFINITELY NOT A MCGUFFIN
IF YOU WEREN'T AWARE TZOLKIN DID START WRITING A SEQUEL TO LOAR THE NEW SHADOW BUT QUICKLY ABANDONED IT REASONING THERE WASN'T MUCH OF A STORY LEFT AFTER THE DEFEAT OF SARON

WIKI




FIRST LET ME PREFACE THIS BY SAYING I DESPISE THE IDEA OF SOMEONE BESIDES JOHN WRITING ORIGINAL NOVELS SET IN ARDA

THAT BEING SAID IN THE UNFORTUNATE EVENT THAT IT DID HAPPEN THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATES WOULD BE THE SECOND AND FOURTH AGES
I SUPPOSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MORE MUNDANE THINGS SINCE MOST OF HISTORY HAS BEEN TOLD MOST DISCUSSIONS ABOUT LOAR AND MIDDLE EARTH AS A WHOLE REVOLVE AROUND TINY THING LIKE COURTING RITUALS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS OF NON HUMAN RACES AND HOBBITS

SO WHILE IT BY NO MEANS WOULD BE A BESTSELLER A BOOK EXPLAINING MINOR DETAILS OF EACH RACE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED DURING SUCH AN EXPANSIVE WORLD BEING BUILT WOULD BE NICE
AS OTHERS HAVE SAID NO ONE OTHER THAN J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN SHOULD BE WRITING ORIGINAL STORIES I LIKE THAT THE SUBSEQUENT PUBLICATIONS HAVE BEEN INFO ON THE DIFFERENT MISC WRITINGS AND VERSIONS AND HISTORY OF WHAT HE WROTE HOME SERIES AT MOST IT CAN BE TOLERATED HAVING AN AUTHOR HELP FILL IN GAPS TO MAKE A FULL NARRATIVE LIKE THE CHILDREN OF AURIN OR SILMARILLION PROVIDED THEY DON'T INVENT THINGS WHOLESALE

ALSO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SON ELDARION WAS MORTAL ARWEN CHOSE TO BE MORTAL SO ANY CHILDREN THEY HAD WOULD ALSO BE MORTAL AND NOT BE GIVEN A CHOICE SIMILAR TO THE CHILDREN OF ELROD

CONSIDERING THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YEARS LEFT TO THE DAGO DAGORATH AND MANY NATIONS ANS RACES IN MIDDLE-EARTH COULDN'T THERE BE A HOST OF COOL STUFF TO HAPPEN

THERE ARE PLENTY OF DWARVES AND I BELIEVE IN THE EAST THERE ARE STILL ACARI ELVES EVEN GREENWOOD STILL HAS THE
USE YOUR IMAGINATION EVERY STORY HAS AN ENDING AND THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ONE LETS NOT RUIN IT
TZOLKIN HIMSELF NEVER FINISHED FINALIZING HIS BIG SILMARILLION STORIES SO SOMEBODY MAYBE MORE FULLY FLESHING OUT QUOR BEDEN LUTHIER AND TURIN WOULD BE FITTING

TURIN IS PRETTY SOLIDLY WRITTEN AS IS HENCE WHY WE GOT A STANDALONE BOOK FOR HIS STORY

STORY ACTUALLY INVOLVES OLDEST WRITINGS THE FALL OF GONDOLIER BUT HE DIDN'T FINISH FULLY MESHING THE TWO TOGETHER AND AS SUCH WE HAVE A DETAILED TURIN GOES TO GONDOLIER AND THEN THERE'S A HARSH CUT TO THE OUTLINE OF THE REST OF THE STORY

BEDEN AND STORY IS TOLD IN A POETIC LESS NARRATIVE MANNER A NOVEL VERSION OF THE STORY COULD MAKE SENSE

I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD THAT GRANDSON HAS GOTTEN INTO WRITING AND HE'S PRETTY GOOD HE READ SOME OF HIS STUFF HISTORICAL FICTION WWII I THINK ON THE DIANE RAIMES SHOW AND IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT BUT COMPELLING HE COULD POTENTIALLY DO SOMETHING FUN WITH IT
SON WOULD BE MORTAL ARWEN LIKE HER UNCLE ELROD CHOSE THE DOOM OF MEN AND THUS LIKE ELROD PROGENY HERS WOULD BE MORTAL IN FACT SHE WAS MORTAL BEFORE SHE MADE HER CHOICE SHE AND HER SIBLINGS WERE ALLOWED TO DELAY THEIR CHOICE UNTIL THEIR FATHER LEFT MIDDLE-EARTH
THE SILMARILLION STORIES NOTABLY THE BIG THREE WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO SEE RETOLD IN STANDALONE FORM THE CHILDREN OF AURIN HAS BEEN THE FALL OF GONDOLIER HAS BEEN MADE INTO A SIMILAR WORK BUT WITH MORE INTERPOLATION AND THE ESTATE ALLOWED ONLY COPIES TO BE PRINTED YOU CAN GOOGLE THE TALE OF GONDOLIER AND A LITTLE SEARCHING WILL TURN UP DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS BUT TO SEE THE WHOLE INSIDE YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF SHELLING OUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR ONE OF THE RARE BOOKS
MIDDLE EARTH ROLEPLAYING GAME MERP FLESHED OUT A LOT OF DETAILS OF AREAS NOT DONE BY TZOLKIN NOT REALLY FULL FLESHED OUT STORIES BUT ENOUGH TO PLAY A GAME AROUND

I AGREE THAT THE TONE WOULD BE DIFFERENT SIMILAR TO THE DUNE SERIES THAT ARE NOW WRITTEN BY FRANK HERBERT SON BRIAN HERBERT KEVIN J ANDERSON THE NEWER NOVELS HAVE MORE ACTION IN THEM AS FRANK TENDED TO SKIRT AROUND ACTION OR TALK ABOUT IT AFTER THE FACT TZOLKIN DID THIS ALSO BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES

THEY WOULD HAVE TO SEARCH FOR SOMEONE WHO HAD SIMILAR WRITING STYLE WHICH IS POSSIBLE BUT NOT PERFECT IF DONE WELL I WOULD WELCOME IT IF DONE BADLY I WOULD JUST IGNORE IT

I DOUBT ANYTHING LIKE THIS WILL HAPPEN OR ANYTHING MOVIE TV IS MADE OUT OF SILMARILLION UNTIL AFTER TOLKIENS KIDS HAVE PASSED AND THE ESTATE PASSES TO THE NEXT GENERATION

ALTHOUGH IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN HAS BEEN THE GHOST WRITER FOR TZOLKIN AS HE FILLED IN GAPS FOR THE SILMARILLION AND ANYTHING PUBLISHED AFTER THAT THAT WAS UNFINISHED HE FINISHED SO IT COULD BE PUBLISHED
I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A STORY NOT SET IN MIDDLE EARTH MIND YOU BUT IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO SLIP IT INTO MIDDLE EARTH I WON'T BECAUSE I KNOW MOST TZOLKIN FANS WOULD MURDER ME WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ANY GOOD AND ALSO I LIKE CHRISTOPHER AND I DON'T WANT TO MAKE HIM ANGRY
SON ELDARION IS NOT HE IS A MAN MORTAL SINCE HER MOTHER CHOOSE THE FATE OF MEN
I GAVE IT A LISTEN LAST WEEK IT WAS INFORMATION I HADN'T REALLY ENCOUNTERED BEFORE LARGELY ABOUT THE ISSUES TZOLKIN HAD GETTING LOAR ACCEPTED IN ACADEMIA AND HOW THE HIPPIE MOVEMENT HELPED BRING IT INTO THE MAINSTREAM IT'S NOT LONG DEFINITELY WORTH A LISTEN
I WAS WONDERING IF ANYONE HERE HAD LISTENED TO THIS PODCAST FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO BASICALLY ITS A MINI BIOGRAPHY OF TZOLKIN THOUGH IT MAINLY COVERS THE PARTS OF HIS LIFE THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ARDA FAIRLY SHORT BUT WELL DONE I THINK THEY DID AN EPISODE ON FANTASY MAPS RECENTLY AS WELL I BELIEVE THAT THIS EPISODE ON TZOLKIN WAS SUPPOSED TO USHER IN A PART SERIES ON FANTASY SO TZOLKIN WILL INEVITABLY REAPPEAR FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE LATER EPISODES AS HE DOES IN THE FANTASY MAPS EPISODE

LINK TO FANTASY MAPS EPISODE HETP
FULLY RECOMMEND THIS PODCAST I'VE ENJOYED IT IMMENSELY
I'M A LONG TIME LISTENER OF THIS PODCAST I'M HAPPY HE FINALLY HAS STARTED COVERING THE REALM OF FANTASY MORE BROADLY I ENJOYED THIS EPISODE A LOT
IF YOU WANT TO MEET THE REAL HOBBIT SMOKING AND EATING MUSHROOM IN NATURE WHILE DANCING AROUND THE FIRE YOU BETTER FIND THE RAINBOW FAMILY AND I DO REMEMBER A FRIEND'S DAD WHO WAS BOTH A LITTLE HIPPIE AND LITERARY GUY HAVING THE HABIT TO SMOKE WHILE READING THE HOBBIT WITH HIS FRIEND IN HIS YOUTH

NICE PODCAST OP THANKS

THIS WAS A BUSY MONTH FOR VOTERS WITH A TOTAL OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING

NERD ENTHUSIASM IS THE BEST
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN WATCH THE FAN EDITED VERSION
IS THIS THE EXTENDED EDITION EDIT OR THEATRICAL VERSION EDIT I KEEP HEARING HOW THE EXTENDED EDITION IS BETTER FOR THE HOBBIT BUT I FEEL LIKE IT WAS ALREADY TOO LONG ARE THE EEG REALLY THAT GOOD
I AM NOT A FAN OF THE HOBBIT FILMS AND THEY GOT SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE AS THE TRILOGY WENT ON

I DO LIKE THIS FAN EDIT IT DOES A WONDERFUL JOB OF RIGHTING ALL THE WRONGS IN THE MOVIE

HOWEVER THERE IS NO FIXING THE BATTLE OF WITS BETWEEN SMUG AND BILBO THAT WAS MY FAVORITE PART IN THE BOOK FRODO WEARING THE RING HIDING FROM SMUG AND THEN HAVING A BACK AND FORTH INTELLECTUAL BATTLE WHERE BILBO TRIES TO GET SMUG TO REVEAL HIS WEAKNESSES WHILE SMUG TRIES TO GET BILBO TO REVEAL WHO HE IS WHERE HE IS FROM AND WHO HE IS ALLIED WITH

INSTEAD PETER JACKSON DECIDES TO HAVE SMUG IMMEDIATELY TRICK BILBO INTO REVEALING HIMSELF AND NEEDING TO BE SAVED IT DESTROYED THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE STORY AND MADE SMUG SEEM LIKE A CLUMSY BUFFOON

MY GOD HOW MUCH I WOULD LOVE A PROPER HOBBIT FILM MADE BY PIXAR
IS THE VIDEO QUALITY CONSISTENT I REMEMBER THIS ONE COMING OUT RIGHT WHEN BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES CAME OUT AND IT WAS A NOTICEABLE DROP IN VIDEO QUALITY WHEN IT GOT TO THOSE SCENES ALTHOUGH I COULD BE MISTAKING THIS FOR A DIFFERENT FAN EDIT

SUB QUESTION

IS THIS THE SAME GUY GIRL S THAT DID THE FOLK AND THE HILL OF SORCERY EDIT WITH ALL THE GANDALF WHITE COUNCIL SCENES SPLICED TOGETHER THAT EDIT FOR HAVING VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL BOOK WAS AWESOME AS WELL
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE WATCHED IT

IS IT REALLY THAT GOOD

DOSE IT CUT TOGETHER WELL

WHO IS CUT FROM THE FILM
I'LL HAVE TO WATCH THIS WHEN I HAVE THE TIME I ALWAYS SAID TWO MINUTE MOVIES BEEN PERFECT FOR THE HOBBIT BUT ONE MINUTE MOVIE SOUNDS GOOD LIKE THE LOAR EXTENDED EDITIONS
SO FAR YOUR VERSION IS THE ONLY FAN EDIT I'VE SEEN OF THE HOBBIT AND I LOVED IT HOWEVER I SEE YOUR RELEASE DATE WAS AUG AND THE VERSION I SAW I THINK WAS BEFORE THEN DID YOU HAVE AN UNFINISHED VERSION OUT THERE IF SO I'LL HAVE TO CHECK OUT THE LATEST ANY LIST OF CHANGES YOU'VE DONE OVER THE VARIOUS VERSIONS

REGARDING FOLK THE HOUR COMPANION TO YOUR HOBBIT EDIT IS THIS A FINALIZED PROJECT

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
THIS IS SO GREAT TO SEE THE MAPLE FILMS EDIT WAS INCREDIBLE I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM TO HAVE A VERSION OF THE HOBBIT THAT I CAN LEGITIMATELY ENJOY WITHOUT WANTING TO THROW SOMETHING AT THE SCREEN MAJOR PROPS U ELDUSTO
YOU DESERVE IT MAN WELL DONE
AND SOMETIMES THE TAKIN TOKEN TZOLKIN GUY
IT REALLY WAS A GREAT EDIT I WATCHED ALL THREE HOBBIT FILMS AND THEN THE EDIT BACK TO BACK AND I PREFERRED THIS EDIT BY FAR
WOW THAT EDIT LOOKS AMAZING I ALWAYS WONDERED IF THE PADDING WAS TRIMMED OUT OF THE THREE FILMS IF YOU COULD MAKE A SINGLE VERY GOOD FILM

DOES ANYONE KNOW IF IT ACTUALLY MADE IT OUT DECEMBER LAST YEAR
WHERE IS THE ACTUAL FULL MOVIE AT

YEAH I WENT TO GREAT LENGTH TO THE TZOLKIN EDIT OF THE HOBBIT WHY IS THERE A PICTURE OF THERE
SORRY FOR DUMB QUESTION BUT IS THIS THE SAME THING AS THE TZOLKIN EDIT THAT WAS RELEASED LAST YEAR IF NOT WHAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT
THIS IS AMAZING
SARON IS A SPIRIT A MAIA AND HE EXISTS IN BOTH THE SEEN AND UNSEEN WORLDS AT THE SAME TIME
ISILDUR DID NOT DEFEAT SARON SARON WAS KILLED IN COMBAT AGAINST AND ELENDIL I SUPPOSE YOU CAN SAY THAT ISILDUR AIDED IN THE PRESERVATION OF SARON SINCE HE DID NOT DESTROY THE ONE

GILGALAD AND ELENDIL ARE SLAIN IN THE ACT OF SLAYING SARON ISILDUR SON CUT THE RING FROM HAND AND HIS POWER DEPARTS AND HIS SPIRIT FLEES INTO THE SHADOWS THE LETTERS OF J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN LETTER

SARON WAS PART OF BOTH WORLDS BOTH THE SEEN AND UNSEEN IN AMAN MANY MAAR WERE UNCLAD WHEREAS OTHERS WERE CLAD IN MATERIAL BODIES ELVES TOO LIVED IN THIS DUAL WORLD AS GANDALF HINTS AT WITH GLORFINDEL TO FRODO MANY MEETINGS IT WOULD APPEAR THE RINGS OF POWER IN CONNECTING WITH THE UNSEEN WRAITH WORLD COULD SLOW THE EFFECTS OF TIME THERE ARE INDEED SEVERAL INTERESTING INSTANCES OF THIS RELATIONSHIP TOM BOBADIL MAKES THE ONE INVISIBLE TO THE EYES OF THE HOBBITS ALSO THE THREE WERE INVISIBLE ON THE HANDS OF THEIR BEARERS THIS IS SEEN IN LOTHLÓRIEN AND WITH GANDALF WHEN THEIR POWER IS DESTROYED THEY ARE ALL VISIBLE ON THEIR FINGER

UPON HIS FINGER WAS A RING OF GOLD WITH A GREAT BLUE STONE ILYA MIGHTIEST OF THE THREE ON HER FINGER WAS KENYA THE RING WROUGHT OF MITHRAIC THAT BORE A SINGLE WHITE STONE FLICKERING LIKE A FROSTY AIR ON HIS HAND HE WORE THE THIRD RING ANARYA THE GREAT AND THE STONE UPON IT WAS RED AS FIRE THE GREY HAVENS

THE RINGS WERE NOT MADE FOR MORTALS AND THIS IS WHY IT AFFECTED THEM SO EXTENDING THEIR LIVES AND INVISIBILITY THEY ARE DRAWN TO THE UNSEEN SARON ELVES PARTAKE IN BOTH THE SEEN AND UNSEEN
IS IT FAIR TO SAY WE DON'T HAVE A CONSENSUS YET
AT THAT POINT IN TIME SARON WAS KINDA LIKE THE RING WRAITHS AS HE LOST HIS PHYSICAL BODY WHEN ERU DESTROYED NOUMENON
INVISIBILITY WAS KINDA LIKE A SIDE EFFECT AS THE MAIN THING IT DID WAS TO CONNECT THE WRAITH WORLD WITH OURS BESIDES THE POWER IT HELD
DELETED
CELEBRIMBOR ALSO WORE THE RING AT ONE POINT IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN AND IT GIFTED HIM THE POWER OF INVISIBILITY ALSO IF THE FALL OF NÙMENÒR PREVENTED SARON FROM TAKING FAIR FORM AND ONLY ALLOWED HIM SHOW HIMSELF AS A DARK LORD HOW WAS HE ABLE TO TRICK CELEBRIMBOR INTO MAKING THE RINGS OF POWER DISGUISED AS AN ELF
BUILDING ON THIS

WE KNOW FROM THE TEXT THAT WHEN HOBBITS AND MEN WEAR THE RING THEY BECOME INVISIBLE

WHEN SARON WORE THE RING IT AMPLIFIED CONCENTRATED HIS POWER

AS FAR AS WE KNOW ONLY BEINGS FRODO SAM BILBO GOLLUM ISILDUR SARON AND RACES HOBBIT MAN MAIA EVER WORE THE ONE RING COULD WE HAVE EXPECTED SIMILAR RESULTS FROM DWARVES ORCS ELVES

ALL THIS TIES INTO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION BY MY BEST GUESS BEING THAT THE RING HAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT EFFECTS DEPENDING ON THOSE WHO WIELD IT RACIAL CHARACTERISTICS MORTALS BECOME INVISIBLE MAIA GAIN POWER ALTHOUGH CORRUPTED IMMORTALS ELVES
BECAUSE MORTALITY IS A GIFT FROM ERU WHEN ELROD WAS GRANTED IT IT WAS GRANTED TO ALL OF HIS DESCENDANTS NO LESS A POWER THEN ERU HIMSELF CAN TAKE MORTALITY AWAY ONCE BESTOWED
THE WERE ALWAYS MORTAL BUT SOME OF THEM PARENTS HIMSELF AND HIS CHILDREN COULD CHOOSE THEIR DOOM THAT OF ELVES OR OF MEN OTHERS WERE NOT GRANTED THIS CHOICE ELBING ELURD ELBURN DIOR AND SALVADOR BUT ONE CAN SEE FROM THEIR ENDS THAT THEY WERE MORTAL SALVADOR LIVED AS LONG AS ANY DÚNADAN AND FATHER AND SIBLINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE HALLS OF BANDOS HAD THEY NOT BEEN MORTAL AND BANDOS KNOWING THIS SAID THAT EÄRENDIL WAS MORTAL

ELROD CHOSE TO BE MORTAL AND HIS DESCENDANTS WERE NOT GRANTED THIS CHOICE ELROD CHOSE TO BE IMMORTAL AND HIS DESCENDANTS WERE GRANTED THIS CHOICE NOTE HOWEVER THAT THIS DID NOT EXTEND TO THE CHILDREN OF ARAGON AND ARWEN IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE CHOICE COULD BE REPEATED SO LONG AS ONE OF THE PARENTS WERE IMMORTAL OR ELSE NOT REPEATED AND THE STATE OF MORTALITY RETAINED SORT OF LIKE AN IF THEN ELSE CONTROL STRUCTURE

IF CONDITION IS IMMORTAL THEN

CHOICE IS PASSED ON

ELSE

CONDITION OF MORTALITY RETAINED

THIS WOULD MAKE SENSE IN THE CASE OF ELROD AND HIS PROGENY AND ARWEN AND HER OWN AND ELROD AND HIS OWN THE FIRST PEREDHIL WHO WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THIS CHOICE WERE 1ST 2ND AND GENERATION ALSO IT WAS TO THIS FAMILY ALONE WHERE THE CHOICE HAD BEEN GIVEN NOT SO WITH SALVADOR WHOSE MOTHER WAS AN ELF
I REMEMBER READING PEOPLES OF THAT THE JUDGEMENT OF FANWE AFTER CONSULTING WITH ERU WAS THAT THE CHOICE OF WHICH RACE TO BELONG ONLY REALLY WAS GIVEN TO ELROD AND ELROD AND SINCE ELROD CHOSE TO BE COUNTED AS ONE OF THE ELDAR HIS CHILDREN WOULD BE FORCED TO MAKE A CHOICE WHEN ELROD LEFT MIDDLE-EARTH THEY COULD CHOOSE TO SAIL WITH HIM AND BE COUNTED AMONG THE ELDAR OR IF THEY CHOSE TO REMAIN IN MIDDLE-EARTH THEY WOULD LIVE A MORTAL LIFE AND FINALLY DIE WHEN ALL WHOM THEY LOVED AND HAD INFLUENCED THEIR CHOICE HAD PASSED AWAY BUT THE LAST PART OF THE JUDGEMENT OF FANWE WAS THAT ANY OTHER CHILDREN PRODUCED FROM THE UNION OF ELVES AND MEN WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY COUNTED AMONG THE RACE OF MEN SO AFTER ELROD AND HIS OFFSPRING NO MORE PEREDHIL THIS EXPLAINS THE FATE OF THE DESCENDANTS OF IMRAZOR AND MITHRELLAS
THERE SHOULDN'T BE TOO MANY NAMES AND PLACES TO GET CONFUSED MOST EDITIONS HAVE MAPS IN THEM THOUGH AS WELL ALL THE REFERENCES TO PAST PLACES EVENTS PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE STORY DON'T FORGET WHEN LOAR WAS FIRST RELEASED THE READERS WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS LOST THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SILMARILLION OR ANYTHING TO READ TO LEARN ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE EARENDIL

R TOLKIENFANS IS CURRENTLY READING THROUGH LOAR AS WELL YOU'RE WELCOME TO JOIN US I PERSONALLY AM ALWAYS REALLY INTERESTED BY WHAT NEW READERS THINK
JUST LET IT ALL WASH OVER YOU ANY TIME SOMEONE TALKS ABOUT HISTORY IT'S ONLY THERE TO HINT AT THE VAST LORE BEHIND THE CHARACTERS ONE DAY YOU MIGHT BECOME A HUGE TZOLKIN FANATIC AND YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT BEDEN LOTHIAN THE SILMARILLS AND MORGOTH THE FALLEN KINGDOM OF NOUMENON AND THE LOST KINGDOM OF AFNOR BUT FOR NOW JUST KEEP READING
THERE SHOULD BE A MAP AT THE BACK AND A GLOSSARY FOR REFERENCE
GOOD IDEA BUT LANGUAGE SEPARATION IS VERY IMPORTANT MAYBE YOU CAN WRITE A SCRIPT TO GET THE WORDS FROM THE LEXICON AND CONVERT IT TO JASON THIS WAY YOU WOULD HAVE A SEPARATE DICTIONARY FOR EACH LANGUAGE
REMOVED
BECAUSE LIVING IN A LAND OF IMMORTALS WOULD JUST MAKE THEM EVEN MORE BITTER AND RESENTFUL OF THEIR OWN MORTALITY THE PROPERTIES OF AMAN MIGHT ALSO HAVE ADVERSE PHYSICAL EFFECTS ON MORTALS ALLEGEDLY THEY WOULD BUT WITHER AND GROW WEARY THE SOONER AS MOTHS IN A LIGHT TOO STRONG AND STEADFAST SEE THIS DISCUSSION
TECHNICALLY THEY CAN BILBO AND FRODO AND LATER SAM DID SO STRICTLY SPEAKING HOBBITS ARE A SUBCATEGORY OF MEN AND THEY ARE CERTAINLY MORTAL THEY ALL TRAVELED TO THE UNDYING LANDS AND LIVED OUT THE REST OF THEIR DAYS THERE DYING EVENTUALLY IT WAS AN EDICT OF MANAWA THAT PREVENTED NÚMENÓREANS OR MORE BROADLY MORTALS FROM ENTERING AMAN

BUT THE DESIGN OF MANAWA WAS THAT THE NÚMENÓREANS SHOULD NOT BE TEMPTED TO SEEK FOR THE BLESSED REALM NOR DESIRE TO OVERPASS THE LIMITS SET TO THEIR BLISS BECOMING ENAMOURED OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE ALAR AND THE ELDAR AND THE LANDS WHERE ALL THINGS ENDURE

THIS EXCHANGE FROM AKALLABÊTH ESPECIALLY SHOWS PRECISELY WHAT MANAWA WISHED TO AVOID

AND SOME THERE WERE WHO SAID WHY SHOULD WE NOT GO EVEN TO AMAN AND TASTE THERE WERE IT BUT FOR A DAY THE BLISS OF THE POWERS HAVE WE NOT BECOME MIGHTY AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ARDA

THE ELDAR REPORTED THESE WORDS TO THE ALAR AND MANAWA WAS GRIEVED SEEING A CLOUD GATHER ON THE NOONTIDE OF NÚMENOR AND HE SENT MESSENGERS TO THE DÚNEDAIN WHO SPOKE EARNESTLY TO THE KING AND TO ALL WHO WOULD LISTEN CONCERNING THE FATE AND FASHION OF THE WORLD

THE DOOM OF THE WORLD THEY SAID ONE ALONE CAN CHANGE WHO MADE IT AND WERE YOU SO TO VOYAGE THAT ESCAPING ALL DECEITS AND SNARES YOU CAME INDEED TO AMAN THE BLESSED REALM LITTLE WOULD IT PROFIT YOU FOR IT IS NOT THE LAND OF MANAWA THAT MAKES ITS PEOPLE DEATHLESS BUT THE DEATHLESS THAT DWELL THEREIN HAVE HALLOWED THE LAND AND THERE YOU WOULD BUT WITHER AND GROW WEARY THE SOONER AS MOTHS IN A LIGHT TOO STRONG AND STEADFAST

BUT THE KING SAID AND DOES NOT EÄRENDIL MY FOREFATHER LIVE OR IS HE NOT IN THE LAND OF AMAN

TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED YOU KNOW THAT HE HAS A FATE APART AND WAS ADJUDGED TO THE FIRSTBORN WHO DIE NOT YET THIS ALSO IS HIS DOOM THAT HE CAN NEVER RETURN AGAIN TO MORTAL LANDS WHEREAS YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE ARE NOT OF THE FIRSTBORN BUT ARE MORTAL MEN AS ILÚVATAR MADE YOU YET IT SEEMS THAT YOU DESIRE NOW TO HAVE THE GOOD OF BOTH KINDREDS TO SAIL TO ALIENOR WHEN YOU WILL AND TO RETURN WHEN YOU PLEASE TO YOUR HOMES THAT CANNOT BE NOR CAN THE ALAR TAKE AWAY THE GIFTS OF ILÚVATAR THE ELDAR YOU SAY ARE UNPUNISHED AND EVEN THOSE WHO REBELLED DO NOT DIE YET THAT IS TO THEM NEITHER REWARD NOR PUNISHMENT BUT THE FULFILMENT OF THEIR BEING THEY CANNOT ESCAPE AND ARE BOUND TO THIS WORLD NEVER TO LEAVE IT SO LONG AS IT LASTS FOR ITS LIFE IS THEIRS AND YOU ARE PUNISHED FOR THE REBELLION OF MEN YOU SAY IN WHICH YOU HAD SMALL PART AND SO IT IS THAT YOU DIE BUT THAT WAS NOT AT FIRST APPOINTED FOR A PUNISHMENT THUS YOU ESCAPE AND LEAVE THE WORLD AND ARE NOT BOUND TO IT IN HOPE OR IN WEARINESS WHICH OF US THEREFORE SHOULD ENVY THE OTHERS

AND THE NÚMENÓREANS ANSWERED WHY SHOULD WE NOT ENVY THE ALAR OR EVEN THE LEAST OF THE DEATHLESS FOR OF US IS REQUIRED A BLIND TRUST AND A HOPE WITHOUT ASSURANCE KNOWING NOT WHAT LIES BEFORE US IN A LITTLE WHILE AND YET WE ALSO LOVE THE EARTH AND WOULD NOT LOSE IT

THEN THE MESSENGERS SAID INDEED THE MIND OF ILÚVATAR CONCERNING YOU IS NOT KNOWN TO THE ALAR AND HE HAS NOT REVEALED ALL THINGS THAT ARE TO COME BUT THIS WE HOLD TO BE TRUE THAT YOUR HOME IS NOT HERE NEITHER IN THE LAND OF AMAN NOR ANYWHERE WITHIN THE CIRCLES OF THE WORLD AND THE DOOM OF MEN THAT THEY SHOULD DEPART WAS AT FIRST A GIFT OF ILÚVATAR IT BECAME A GRIEF TO THEM ONLY BECAUSE COMING UNDER THE SHADOW OF MORGOTH IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY A GREAT DARKNESS OF WHICH THEY WERE AFRAID AND SOME GREW WILFUL AND PROUD AND WOULD NOT YIELD UNTIL LIFE WAS REFT FROM THEM WE WHO BEAR THE BURDEN OF THE YEARS DO NOT CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THIS BUT IF THAT GRIEF HAS RETURNED TO TROUBLE YOU AS YOU SAY THEN WE FEAR THAT THE SHADOW ARISES ONCE MORE AND GROWS AGAIN IN YOUR HEARTS THEREFORE THOUGH YOU BE THE DÚNEDAIN FAIREST OF MEN WHO ESCAPED FROM THE SHADOW OF OLD AND FOUGHT VALIANTLY AGAINST IT WE SAY TO YOU BEWARE THE WILL OF ERU MAY NOT BE GAINSAID AND THE ALAR BID YOU EARNESTLY NOT TO WITHHOLD THE TRUST TO WHICH YOU ARE CALLED LEST SOON IT BECOME AGAIN A BOND BY WHICH YOU ARE CONSTRAINED HOPE RATHER THAT IN THE END EVEN THE LEAST OF YOUR DESIRES SHALL HAVE FRUIT THE LOVE OF ARDA WAS SET IN YOUR HEARTS BY ILÚVATAR AND HE DOES NOT PLANT TO NO PURPOSE NONETHELESS MANY AGES OF MEN UNBORN MAY PASS ERE THAT PURPOSE IS MADE KNOWN AND TO YOU IT WILL BE REVEALED AND NOT TO THE ALAR



THE ALAR SAY THAT THEY CAN'T TAKE AWAY THE GIFT OF MAN BUT WE ARE NEVER GIVEN A REASON WHY MEN CAN'T JUST STAY IN ALIENOR FOR THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES AND STILL DEPART FROM THE WORLD AFTERWARDS
REALLY NICE HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS
IS THAT ALL FREEHAND
A FRIEND AND I DID SOMETHING SIMILAR A FEW YEARS AGO LOTS OF ERRORS BUT STILL A FUN PROJECT
I WONDER IF THIS DEVICE COULD ALSO DO A SIMILAR JOB


HEY MAKING THIS RIGHT NOW ALL THAT FINE DETAIL IS A PAIN IN THE WRIST BUT YOU DID A FANTASTIC JOB
I READ THE SILMARILLION IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HAD TO DO A PRESENTATION TO THE WHOLE CLASSICAL EVERYONE JUST STARED AT ME LIKE WUT WHEN I PRESENTED GOOD BOOK BUT IT'S A HARD READ
THIS IS WHY I'M GLAD MY COPY HAS A THOROUGH INDEX OF NAMES
I HAVE READ THAT BOOK LIKE TIMES I STILL DON'T THINK I KNOW WHAT WENT ON AND I NORMALLY READ COMPLEX LEGAL CASES AND HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT

I GENUINELY FEEL LIKE I NEED TO SIT DOWN WITH A PEN AND PAPER AND TAKE NOTES AS I GO
LOVE THIS I DID THE SAME BUT PRINTED OFF THE FAMILY TREES AND MAPS WITH NOTES ALL OVER THEM TO SAVE FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH MILLIONS OF TIMES
MEANWHILE ELROD IS BACK THERE ALL LIKE DAD
PETER JACKSON YOU KNOW I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU BUT NOW YOU'RE JUST MAKING SHIT UP
CAN SOMEONE PLS EXPLAIN THIS TO ME
SHE LOOKED RADIANT AND POWERFUL IN THAT FORM IN LOAR THEY WENT WAY TOO FAR AND LOOK LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TOO HARD ON THE SPOOKY SPECTRE KINDA RING WRAITHY GHOSTY THING IN THE HOBBIT NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT

ON TOP OF THE WHOLE SCENE'S RIDICULOUSNESS
FRODO JUST V ED SARON WITH IT THEN
I HATED THAT SCENE BUT THIS IS A NEAT TOUCH
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS AN ACTUAL EXPLANATION BUT SAM IS DEFINITELY THE LEAST CULTURED EDUCATED OF THE GROUP SO MAYBE HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW THE CORRECT WAY TO FASTEN THE BROOCH
DOES SAM OR SEAN ASTIN HAVE A DIFFERENT PRIMARY HAND THAN THE REST OF THE FELLOWSHIP
PO
WELL I LIKE THE LET'S CALL THEM VISUALS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T QUITE CALL IT ANIMATION
I DIDN'T KNOW THE ARKENSTONE WAS USED TO KILL SLAG
BEEN BETTER

FAFFY
THIS IS GENE WORK POSSIBLY HIS BEST HE ALSO RUINED TOM JERRY FOR A FEW YEARS IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY HE HAD A CONTRACT TO DO THIS BUT WAS RUNNING OUT OF TIME BEFORE THE CONTRACT EXPIRED SO HE THREW THIS TOGETHER IN A HURRY
NOT MUCH
IT ACTUALLY WASNT TERRIBLE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION FOR SURE BUT QUITE INTERESTING ARTWORK ITD BE GREAT FOR YEAR OLDS WHO COULDNT STAY INTERESTED IN THE STORY ITSELF
IF YOU'RE WATCHING WATCH LOAR THEY WERE MADE FIRST AND THE HOBBIT FILMS ARE MADE IN SUCH A WAY THEY ASSUME YOU'VE SEEN THE LOAR FILMS DESPITE IT BEING A PREQUEL
YOU SHOULD NEVER WATCH THE HOBBIT TRILOGY EVER FIND A FAN CUT AND WATCH THAT INSTEAD THEN YOU'LL SKIP ALL THE RIDICULOUS BULLSHIT P ADDED
HOBBIT FILMS ULTIMATELY WERE A CASH GRAB TO APPEAL TO THE NOSTALGIA OF THE LOAR FILMS WATCH LOAR FIRST THEN HOBBIT OR JUST NOT WATCH HOBBIT AT ALL
IGNORE THE HOBBIT ALL TOGETHER
I THINK IF YOU'VE SEEN NONE OF THEM BEFORE YOU SHOULD START WITH THE HOBBIT TRILOGY ONLY BECAUSE OF THE FEEL OF THE FILMS THE HOBBIT STARTS OUT QUITE LIGHT AND GETS A BIT DARK BUT NOT MASSIVELY THE LORD OF THE RINGS GETS DARK PRETTY QUICKLY I THINK GOING FROM THE RETURN OF THE KING TO AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY MIGHT BE QUITE JARRING
I JUST WANT TO AFFIRM THAT THERE REALLY ARE SOME GREAT FAN EDITS OF THE HOBBIT TRILOGY

SOMEONE ELSE ALREADY MENTIONED MAPLE FILMS AND I TOTALLY AGREE WATCH THEIR FAN EDIT VERSION IT TAKES OUT ALL THE NONSENSE AND CUTS THE THREE MOVIES INTO ONE HOUR MOVIE IT GOES FROM A TO AN NO JOKE

EDIT JUST GOOGLE MAPLE FILMS THE HOBBIT IT'S FREE TO WATCH IN HD ON THEIR WEBSITE
WATCH THE HOBBIT FIRST AND THEN LOAR MOST PEOPLE HERE WILL SHIT ON THE HOBBIT MOVIES BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY REALLY WELL MADE JUST LESS SERIOUS THAN LOAR
THE BEST WAY TO WATCH THE MOVIES IS TO NOT WATCH THE HOBBIT AT ALL THE SECOND AND THIRD MOVIES ARE STEAMING PILES OF SHIT THAT VIOLATE EVERYTHING BOOK WAS

THE LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THOUGH STILL NOT AS GOOD AS THE BOOK
IT'S SORT OF LIKE STAR WARS WITH THE PREQUEL SITUATION EVEN THOUGH THE HOBBIT TECHNICALLY COMES BEFORE THE LOAR CHRONOLOGICALLY THE MOVIES ARE MADE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY EXPECT YOU TO HAVE SEEN THE MAIN SERIES FIRST

SO WATCH THE LOAR TRILOGY FIRST PREFERABLY THE EXTENDED VERSION THEN FOLLOW IT UP WITH THE HOBBIT TRILOGY

THAT SAID I WOULD ECHO THE OTHER SENTIMENTS HERE THE HOBBIT TRILOGY DOES NOT REALLY HOLD A CANDLE TO THE LOAR TRILOGY I WOULD RECOMMEND FINDING A FANOUT THAT CONDENSES THE FILM DOWN A BIT AND CUTS OUT ALL THE EXTRANEOUS NONSENSE
AH THANK YOU ALL I DID NOT EXPECT SUCH AN IN DEPTH TALK ABOUT IT I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR INSIGHTS
NUMBER THAT'S HOW YOU GET SOMETHING LIKE THE ENDLESS TEDIOUS BATTLES IN BFA PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW OR CARE ABOUT FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING


SURE
WOULD HAVE BEEN COOL YES BUT NOT NECESSARY I THINK IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE PROLOGUE AS IS
IF THEY EVER DO A MOVIE ABOUT NOUMENON AND THE SECOND AGE IT COULD END WITH THE LAST ALLIANCE NOTE I REALIZE THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN
A TON OF CGI AND BATTLE SCENES BUT SURE
FOAH FOAH WAGH RES SAYS FROM R WOW TO R LOAR NOW THAT'S SUPER USEFUL
OR JUST PLAY LORD OF THE RINGS ONLINE AND DO IT FOR REAL
AND MY AXE
ORIGINAL POST

R WOW COMMENTS


I WILL DO IT I WILL TAKE THE RING TO MORDOR THOUGH I DO NOT KNOW THE WAY NOR HOW TO DESTROY IT WITHOUT LOSING MY OWN ARMS
EASTER EGG
AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE ARE TWO HYPOTHESIS

SARON NEVER EVEN REMOTELY THOUGHT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMEONE DESTROYING THE RING HE BECAME SO EVIL THAT HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND GOODNESS ANYMORE SO BASICALLY HE KNEW THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE USED THE RING RATHER THAN DESTROYING IT FOR INSTANCE HE THOUGHT THAT ARAGON GOT THE RING AND WAS TRYING TO DEFEAT HIM WITH IT I DON'T LIKE THIS HYPOTHESIS THOUGH SARON IS LIKE THE MASTER OF DECEPTION IT SEEMS UNLIKELY TO ME THAT HE DIDN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A DECEPTION AGAINST HIM

SARON KNEW THAT NO LIVING CREATURE ON THE WORLD COULD EVER WILLINGLY DESTROY THE RING SINCE ITS INFLUENCE WAS EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG MAYBE EVEN ELROD WOULD HAVE FAILED TO TOSS IT IF HE HAD IT INSTEAD OF ISILDUR MAYBE EVEN THE GOOD IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL IN FACT FRODO FAILED TO DO IT AND ONLY CHANCE AND LUCK MADE IT HAPPEN AT THE VERY END IN THE BOOKS THERE IS NO CONFLICT AFTER GOLLUM GETS THE RING HE JUST STARTS JUMPING WITH JOY MAKES A STEP TOO FAR AND FALLS
I THINK SARON WAS COMPLETE CORRECT THAT NO MORTAL OR IMMORTAL COULD EVER WILLINGLY DESTROY THE RING THAT IS WHY MOUNT DOOM WAS NOT EVEN GUARDED ALL THE POWERS OF MIDDLE EARTH PASSED ON THE RING GANDALF GALDRIEL ELROD THEY KNEW THE RING WOULD BEAT THEM EVEN FRODO FAILED AT THE END HE COULDN'T DESTROY THE RING WHEN IT CAME TIME NO ONE COULD DESTROY THAT RING WILLINGLY

THE VICTORY CAME NOT BECAUSE FRODO OR ARAGON OR GANDALF SUCCEEDED IN WAR THEY WERE VICTORIOUS BECAUSE BILBO AND FRODO HAD PITY IN THEIR HEARTS FOR COLUMN BOTH SAVED COLUMN WHEN THEY HAD A CHANCE BOTH TIMES THE CORRECT ACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO KILL THE WRETCHED CREATURE BUT LIFE WAS VICTORIOUS OVER DEATH LOVE WAS VICTORIOUS OVER HATE THE SONG OF ILUVATAR WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE SONG OF MELIOR AND ENCOMPASSED IT MELIOR AND SARON WERE DEFEATED BY THE GOOD IN THE WORLD PITY AND LOVE NOT BY POWER MELIOR AND SARON REJECTED LOVE AND PITY AND THAT REJECTION OF THE CREATION OF ILUVATAR WAS THEIR DOWN FALL

I DON'T BELIEVE ILUVATAR INTERFERED AND PUSHED COLUMN INTO THE LAVA THAT WAS JUST THE WAY WILL WAS CARRIED FORWARD BY HIS CREATIONS USING LOVE AND PITY COLUMN JUST FELL THAT IS ALL

THEREFORE SARON NEVER HAD A CHANCE OF WINNING THE BATTLE WAS LOST WHEN MELIOR TRIED TO OVERCOME SONG ILUVATAR PLAYS THE LONG GAME DEFEATING MELIOR WITH HIS OWN WEAKNESS LACK OF LOVE AND PITY AND WITH THE LEAST OF HIS CREATIONS HOBBITS WHOSE WHOLE LIFE WAS ABOUT HAPPINESS AND LOVE NOT HATE AND POWER
I THINK IT WAS HIS LACK OF EMPATHY THAT LEAD TO HIS DEFEAT IF HE WERE IN THE FELLOWSHIP'S PLACE HE USED THE RING FOR HIMSELF SO HE COULDN'T IMAGINE THEM DOING ANYTHING ELSE IF SARON KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO DESTROY THE RING HE COULD HAVE EASILY GUARDED THE ENTRANCE TO MOUNT DOOM
FATE PLAYS A LARGE ROLE IN THE STORY SO I GUESS THERE WAS NEVER REALLY A CHANCE FOR HIM TO SUCCEED BUT IF ANYTHING HAD STOPPED THE HOBBITS FROM DESTROYING THE RING HE WON
WELL HE HAD THE ARMIES OF THE WEST SORELY OUTNUMBERED

IT WAS BASICALLY AN ACT OF ERU THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL SARON COULD HAVE CONTEMPLATED ANYONE DOING A VICTORY JIG IN SHAMMASH NAUR AND FALLING INTO THE LAVA BELOW
SARON WAS ALWAYS EVIL BUT HIS EVIL BLOSSOMED WHEN HE JOINED MORGOTH THERE WAS NEVER ANY GOODNESS IN HIM EVEN BEFORE HE LEFT THE BLESSED REALM OF ALIENOR FOR MIDDLE-EARTH HE WAS CHIEF SERVANT

THE MOMENT SARON PUT ALL OF HIS POWER INTO THE ONE RING HE SEALED HIS FATE HIS WHOLE EXISTENCE DEPENDED ON THE SURVIVAL OF THE RING THE ONLY REASON SARON FEARED ARAGON WAS BECAUSE HE WAS HEIR SO EVEN IF SARON WAS ABLE TO POSSESS THE RING AGAIN HIS FEAR OF ARAGON WOULD STILL REMAIN
PERSONALLY I LOVE STING BUT OF THOSE 2 I'D PICK GLAMOURING

IN THIS CASE HOWEVER THE ONLY OPINION THAT MATTERS IS YOURS
MY COLLEGE FRIENDS BOUGHT ME STING AS A WEDDING PRESENT AND I LOVE IT I THINK BETWEEN THE TWO YOU'VE LISTED I MIGHT LEAN TOWARDS GLAMOURING BUT ANDURIL WOULD BE PRETTY SWEET AND IT'S MORE ICONIC AND IMPORTANT TO THE STORY OF LOAR OWNING THE SWORD THAT WAS BROKEN IN YOUR HOME WOULD BE PRETTY COOL PERSONALLY I DO LOVE OWNING STING

JKPHNBN
NEVER KNEW ABOUT THIS WEBSITE THANKS ALSO BUYING ANDURIL MYSELF NOW IF THAT HELPS YOU DECIDE HAHA
I'D ABSOLUTELY GO WITH GLAMOURING BUT THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF IT ON THAT WEBSITE WHY IS THE HOBBIT VERSION MORE IF THEY'RE THE SAME SWORD
I'D PUT MY VOTE IN FOR STING AS WELL I GOT IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY AND LOVE IT OF THE TWO YOU LIST I'D SAY IF YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO EVER OWN SWORD FROM THE TRILOGY THEN I'D GO WITH ANDURIL SINCE IT'S ALSO FAMOUS FROM THAT STORY IF YOU PLAN ON PURCHASING MORE LATER YOU CAN GO WITH THE GOAL I HAVE AND TRY AND GET THE SWORDS FROM THE TROLL CAVE STING GLAMOURING AND ORCRIST
ANDURIL ALL THE WAY ITS THE FLAME OF THE WEST AND IF YOU'RE AMERICAN I THINK THAT'S PRETTY IRONIC
THANKS FOR YOUR RESPONSES I THINK I'M GONNA GO FOR GLAMOURING I LOVE THE STING TOO BUT THE OTHER TWO SWORDS ARE BIGGER SO I JUST THOUGHT THEY'D BE MORE EPIC AS YOU WALK IN THE ROOM
JUST GET EVERY WEAPON AND JUST CHANGE THEM OUT THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHERE AND FOR HOW MUCH DO I GET ONE
BACK DOOR OF ERECTOR SOUNDS LIKE A TZOLKIN THEMED PORN
IT IS UNLIKELY TO BE MADE INTO A FILM FOR BOTH STORYTELLING REASONS VERY DIVISIVE JAM PACKED STORY FOLLOWING A BUNCH OF LARGELY SELF SERVING ARROGANT IMMORTALS WRITTEN AS MORE OF A CREATION MYTH HISTORICAL CHRONICLE THAN STRAIGHT FORWARD STORY PACKED WITH RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND A VERY DARK EPIC TONE THAT WOULD NEED A MASSIVE BUDGET TO DO THINGS JUSTICE AND WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO ATTRACT THE FINANCING OF A STUDIO OR THE INTEREST OF MORE CASUAL VIEWERS THAT'S ASSUMING YOU COULD EVEN WIELD THE DENSE STORY INTO A SCRIPT THAT FANS ACTUALLY LIKED THERE'S SO LITTLE DIALOGUE AND CHARACTER INTERACTION ON A PERSONAL LEVEL ANY FILM WOULD BE MORE FAN FICTION THAN ADAPTION ANYWAY AND FOR THE LEGAL WHAT I'VE READ IS TRUE IT LITERALLY WON'T BE MADE INTO A FILM FOR DECADES

ACCORDING TO THIS ARTICLE THE COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS OF CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN AND THE TZOLKIN ESTATE ABOUT THE PREVIOUS FILMS WERE MORE COMPLICATED THAN MERE ISSUES WITH THE LOAR SCRIPTS LEGALLY A SILMARILLION FILM MIGHT NOT EVEN BE POSSIBLE

BOOKS

TZOLKIN HAS BECOME A MONSTER DEVOURED BY HIS OWN POPULARITY AND ABSORBED INTO THE ABSURDITY OF OUR TIME SAID CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN THE CHASM BETWEEN THE BEAUTY AND SERIOUSNESS OF THE WORK AND WHAT IT HAS BECOME HAS OVERWHELMED ME THE COMMERCIALIZATION HAS REDUCED THE AESTHETIC AND PHILOSOPHICAL IMPACT OF THE CREATION TO NOTHING THERE IS ONLY ONE SOLUTION FOR ME TO TURN MY HEAD AWAY

THEY EVISCERATED THE BOOK BY MAKING IT AN ACTION MOVIE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AGED TO AND IT SEEMS THAT THE HOBBIT WILL BE THE SAME KIND OF FILM

I WAS IN MY FATHER S OFFICE AT OXFORD HE CAME IN AND STARTED LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WITH GREAT ANXIETY THEN I REALIZED IN HORROR THAT IT WAS THE SILMARILLION AND I WAS TERRIFIED AT THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD DISCOVER WHAT I HAD DONE

CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN IS OF THE SILMARILLION UNDER COPYRIGHT LAW NOT SURE ABOUT THE OTHER BOOKS WHICH HE EDITED

CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN HOLDS THE AUTHORIAL COPYRIGHT ON THE SILMARILLION NOT J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN HARPER COLLINS HAS CONFIRMED WITH US THAT UNDER CURRENT COPYRIGHT LAWS THE COPYRIGHT WILL THEREFORE NOT EXPIRE UNTIL YEARS AFTER CHRISTOPHER S DEATH AND NOT IN WHEN THE COPYRIGHT ON THE WORKS OF J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN WILL EXPIRE UPDATED

WHICH MIGHT MEAN HE'D BE ABLE TO PUT IN A CLAUSE IN HIS WILL ASKING THAT THE RIGHTS TO THE SILMARILLION ETC ARE KEPT IN THE FAMILY AND NOT SOLD UNTIL HIS COPYRIGHT PASSES INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON COPYRIGHT LAW BUT EITHER WAY I THINK IT WILL BE A VERY LONG TIME BEFORE WE SEE ANY OF THE OTHER BOOKS BE ADAPTED INTO BLOCKBUSTERS FOR BOTH LEGAL AND MONETARY REASONS

AND LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM HE IS AN FORMER ANGLO SAXON SCHOLAR AND LECTURER AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY CHRISTOPHER WAS ALSO GIVEN COMPLETE CREATIVE CONTROL BY HIS FATHER IN HIS WILL TO

PUBLISH EDIT ALTER REWRITE OR COMPLETE ANY WORK OF MINE
WHICH MAY BE UNPUBLISHED AT MY DEATH OR TO DESTROY THE WHOLE
OR ANY PART OR PARTS OF ANY SUCH UNPUBLISHED WORKS AS HE
IN HIS ABSOLUTE DISCRETION MAY THINK FIT AND SUBJECT THERETO

HE ALSO WISELY URGES THE EXECUTORS TO KEEP HIS COPYRIGHTS IN THE FAMILY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE



SO I MASCULINE O HE'S SIMPLY CAUTIOUSLY PROTECTING HIS FATHER'S LITERARY INTERESTS IN THE WAY HE DEEMS MOST APPROPRIATE IF YOU LOOK AT TZOLKIN SENIOR'S COMMENTS REGARDING MOOTED ADAPTIONS AND DRAMA AS ART FORM AT LARGE I THINK IT'S FAIRLY LIKELY HIS VIEWPOINTS ARE IN LINE WITH HIS FATHERS

TORP

INTERVIEW WITH CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN




ALSO THIS OLD THREAD ON A TZOLKIN FORUM IS ENLIGHTENING GIVING AN APPARENT INSIGHT INTO HIS VIEWS ON THE FILMS EXTRACTS QUOTED BELOW



CT AND THE TZOLKIN ESTATE FAMILY GET NOTHING WHATSOEVER FROM VIDEO GAMES SOUNDTRACKS MERCHANDISE COLLECTIBLES ACTION FIGURES BOBBLEHEADS BURGER KING CUPS ETC ETC ETC THE ONLY RIGHTS TZOLKIN PERE RETAINED WAS TO THE BOOKS THEMSELVES AND A CERTAIN ROYALTY PAYMENT ON THE FILMS GROSS PROFITS WHICH APPARENTLY DOESN'T COUNT MERCHANDISING YES BOOK SALES HAVE INCREASED

TO THE MAIN POINT I AM IN AN AWKWARD POSITION HERE BECAUSE CT HAS SHARED WITH ME HIS OPINIONS OF PJ'S WORK NOT TH OF COURSE HIS CRITICISM IS PAGES AND PAGES LONG AND NOT COMPLIMENTARY AT ALL UNFORTUNATELY I SIMPLY CANNOT SHARE ANY OF THIS MATERIAL PUBLICLY ALL I CAN SAY IN VERY BROAD TERMS IS THAT CT FEELS THAT ALL THE THEMES THAT TO HIM MAKE THE LR IMPORTANT ARE COMPLETELY SUBMERGED IN THE MOVIE BEHIND FRENETIC MOTION CHASES FIGHTS AND SHRIEKING CHOIRS AND IN ONE MAJOR CASE POOR CASTING BUT HE ALSO HAS SOME VERY COGENT THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE ALTERATION OF CHARACTERS AND THE POOR RENDERING OF PARTICULAR SCENES STEMMING FROM PJ'S APPARENTLY POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BOOK I FIND COMMENTS A BIT AMUSING BECAUSE CT ACTUALLY DOES KNOW RATHER A LOT ABOUT CINEMA AND HIS SUGGESTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENTS ON WHAT P DID YES THAT'S A SEEMING OXYMORON AND THE REASON UNDERLYING THE LAWSUIT

I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT MATTERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ARRANGED TO FORESTALL THAT

IN ANY EVENT NO STUDIO WOULD EVER EVER EVER GIVE AN AUTHOR FINAL CUT AND MEAN IT LOOK AT THE WAY DISNEY SWINDLED P L TRAVERS ON A SIMILAR CONTRACT PROVISION OVER MARY POPPINS IT WOULD BE HONOURED AS SINCERELY AS PROFIT PERCENTAGE I EAST NOT AT ALL CT IN THIS IS NOT BEING SHORTSIGHTED HE'S BEING A REALIST

BESIDES I THINK YOU FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE POSITION TAKEN BY CT THAT NO ADEQUATE FILM ADAPTATION OF THE LR MUCH LESS THE SILMARILLION COULD BE MADE AND THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF BATTLES AND MONSTERS VS TECHNOLOGY IT SIMPLY DOESN'T TRANSLATE ITS ESSENCE TO FILM WELL AT ALL OR AT LEAST NOT A FILM WHICH COULD REMOTELY HOPE FOR SUFFICIENT BOX-OFFICE TO COVER ITS COSTS AND HOLLYWOOD VERY MUCH CARES ABOUT CASH OVER ARTICLE NO STUDIO IS EVER GOING TO MAKE A TZOLKIN MOVIE AS A LABOUR OF LOVE

ALL YOU'RE REALLY ARGUING NEAR AS I CAN TELL IS THAT CT SHOULD JUST SURRENDER TO THE COMMERCIAL PIMPING AND SELL OUT LIKE AUDREY SEUSS ON THE GROUNDS HE AND THE FAMILY CAN'T RESIST FOREVER WELL MAYBE THAT WILL IN FUTURE DECADES PROVE TO BE THE CASE BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN ONE SHOULDN'T NONETHELESS FIGHT THE LONG DEFEAT

AND THAT POINT IS EXPLICITLY OPINION

CHRISTOPHER DOESN'T CARE WHETHER BOOK SALES INCREASE HE REALLY DOESN'T HE WOULD RATHER ACCEPT THE SILMARILLION GOING OUT OF PRINT THAN SEE IT KEPT AFLOAT ON THE BACK OF MOVIES LIKE PJ'S YES HE SAID SO

IT IS WORTH NOTING THE TZOLKIN ESTATE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN AN ONGOING LAWSUIT WITH WARNER BROTHERS SO THEY ARE VERY UNLIKELY TO WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH THAT PARTICULAR STUDIO AGAIN



I CAME ACROSS THIS IN A ADJ REVIEW IT BEST SUMS UP MY THOUGHTS

I THINK ADAPTING ANY PORTION OF THE SILMARILLION WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE COMPLICATED AND CONTROVERSIAL THAN ADAPTING THE HOBBIT WAS THE BIBLICAL TONE OF MUCH OF THE WORK IS LIKELY UNTRANSLATABLE TO FILM AS IS THE SENSE OF NARRATIVE REMOVE AND THE VAST SWATHS OF TIME INVOLVED I THINK AN ADAPTATION OF THE SILMARILLION THAT IS TRUE TO THE SUPERLATIVE CREATIVE CORE OF THAT SPECIFIC TEXT WHILE ALSO IN KEEPING WITH TZOLKIN S BROADER VISION OF MIDDLE EARTH WOULD PROBABLY LOOK SOMETHING LIKE TERRENCE MALICK S THE TREE OF LIFE IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULD REQUIRE EXPERIMENTAL SHOOTING AND NARRATIVE TECHNIQUES AND WOULD BE PANNED BY MOST OF THOSE INCLINED TO ENJOY HOLLYWOOD S PRESENT TAKE ON THE EPIC SO MUCH OF WHAT SEEMS DRY AND FACTUAL ON THE PAGE WOULD NEED TO BE PRESENTED AS ETHEREAL AND IMPRESSIONISTIC ON THE SILVER SCREEN AND I DON T THINK TZOLKIN FANS WOULD HAVE THE PATIENCE FOR IT

TO THE EXTENT THE STORIES OF THE SILMARILLION ARE IN SITU A MYTHOLOGICAL HAZE THAT HANGS INVISIBLY OVER MIDDLE EARTH REIFIED IN SONG AND STATUE YES BUT NEVER TOUCHED IN THEIR ESSENCE EXCEPT IN THE WAKING AND SLEEPING VISIONS OF INDIVIDUAL DWARVES ELVES GOBLINS ORCS WIZARDS AND MEN YOU WOULDN T WANT TO FALSELY CRYSTALLIZE THEM INTO WHAT COULD EASILY LOOK LIKE A MIDDLE EARTH DOCUMENTARY SHALL WE TELL THE STORY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE WORLD AS THOUGH IT WERE THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR FIELDS REIMAGINE ALIENOR USING A SIMPLY MORE SUMPTUOUS VERSION OF THE EXISTING RIVENDELL SET CAN WE SPEAK OF THE BEINGS IN THE SILMARILLION LET ALONE PORTRAY THEM IN FILM AS JUST GRANDER VERSIONS OF THE HEROES OF THE FELLOWSHIP NO IF YOU RE GOING TO CAST A FILM ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH GODS GODLIKE CREATURES AND LEGENDARY PERSONAE YOU HAVE TO EMPLOY A VISUAL STYLE THAT ESTABLISHES THESE ENTITIES AND THE EVENTS THEY PRODUCE AND MOVE THROUGH AS BEING SOMEHOW BEYOND OUR IMMEDIATE UNDERSTANDING JACKSON WOULD LIKELY NOT BE THE APPROPRIATE DIRECTOR FOR SUCH A WORK AS TOO MANY EXPECTATIONS INCONGRUOUS WITH SUCH AN ADAPTATION ALREADY ATTACH EVEN NOW TO HIS PROJECTS WE WOULD NEED INSTEAD A DIRECTOR AND A SCREENWRITER WITH WHOM OUR EXPECTATIONS WOULD RUN MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT WE D CALL AN ART HOUSE FILM

SO I GUESS I D SAY THAT FAILING THOSE PREREQUISITES BEING MET I DON T THINK I D WANT TO SEE THE SILMARILLION ADAPTED AT ALL AND SO I CAN T PREDICT WHICH STORIES FROM THE BOOK I D MOST WANT TO SEE ADAPTED AS THE STYLE OF ADAPTATION I D CONSIDER MOST APPROPRIATE WOULD CONSTITUTE AN ARTISTIC VISION WELL BEYOND AT LEAST IN CINEMATIC TERMS MY PRESENT UNDERSTANDING OR MY ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE




I PRAY FOR THIS TO NEVER HAPPEN SILMARILLION IS WAY TOO BEAUTIFUL TO BECOME A MOVIE

I DON'T WANT ANY OF MY IMAGINATION TO BE OVERRIDDEN BY MOVIE CHARACTERS PLACES VOICES SONGS LIKE HAPPENED WITH THE LORD OF THE RINGS I WILL NEVER READ TO FRODO AGAIN WITHOUT SEEING ELIJAH FACE

I DON'T WANT TO READ THE SILMARILLION AND SEE TURIN TURAMBAR FINGOLFIN BEDEN OR LÚTHIEN AND ALL THE OTHERS WITH HOLLYWOODIAN FACES I DON'T WANT TO LOOK TO PETER GONDOLIER OR SINGBAND AND LOSE WHAT MY MIND HAS CREATED
I DON'T THINK A SILMARILLION MOVIE WOULD WORK AT ALL THERE'S SIMPLY TOO MUCH MATERIAL AND THE CUTS WOULD HAVE TO BE TOO SEVERE TO EVEN CALL IT THE SILMARILLION ANYMORE

NOW THERE COULD BE POTENTIAL TO TAKE CERTAIN STORIES FROM THE SILMARILLION AND MAKE STANDALONE MOVIES THE POTENTIAL FOR THESE TO BE BUTCHERED WOULD BE VERY HIGH BUT IT'S AT LEAST POSSIBLE AT A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL

SOME OF THESE POTENTIAL MOVIES COULD BE
BEDEN AND LUTHIER
TURIN

AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IDEA WOULD BE A MOVIE ABOUT NOUMENON AND THE SECOND AGE IT COULD START WITH A PROLOGUE SHOWING THE WAR OF WRATH SIMILAR TO HOW LOAR STARTED WITH A PROLOGUE OF THE LAST ALLIANCE IT COULD SHOW HOW NOUMENON DEVELOPED AND ALL THE INTERACTIONS WITH SARON WOULD ACTUALLY HELP TIE IT IN TO LOAR VERY EFFECTIVELY THEY COULD EVEN SHOW SARON FORGING THE RINGS WITH THE ELVES AND THEN CORRUPTING NOUMENON AND GETTING IT DESTROYED AND THEN THE END OF THE FILM WOULD SHOW THE LAST ALLIANCE

OF COURSE THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN BUT IT'S THE ONE EXTRA MOVIE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF ANOTHER IS EVER MADE
NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON FILM BUSINESS
REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT PARTY BUSINESS
HELL THEY MADE ME SIGN A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
I WAS GOING TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE ON MYSPACE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I CAN'T ANYMORE SHAME
THIS STRIKES ME AS A VERY LENIENT ARRANGEMENT HOW MANY MOVIE SETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION ALLOW TOURISTS IN AND LET THEM TAKE PICTURES

IT'S SO MILDLY THREATENING AND BASICALLY IT JUST MEANS DO WHATEVER YOU WANT JUST DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE

I CAN'T IMAGINE SUCH A THING WAS EVER ENFORCED BUT ON ASSHOLES ASKING FOR IT
I WAS THERE IN CAN CONFIRM IT LOOKED THE EXACT SAME AS IT DID IN LOAR THOUGH SO I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD ALL THE SECRECY
SO OP IS ABOUT TO GET SUED
I WAS THERE SIX YEARS AGO TODAY SIGNED THE AGREEMENT POSTED THE PHOTOS ANYWAY
AND THOSE MOVIES WERE TOTAL SHIT ANYWAY HOW COULD IAN MCKELLEN PETER JACKSON NEW ZEALAND AND EVERYONE ELSE BEHIND THOSE FLAMING PIECES OF TRASH POSSIBLY FAIL US SO OH YES CHILDREN DUMBASS AVERAGE AMERICAN APPEAL
LESSER KNOWN SEQUEL

THE HOBBIT LORD OF THE BEES EXTENDED EXTENDED EDITION
BACK WHEN FELLOWSHIP CAME OUT THERE WERE THESE PROMO SHOTS OF MORIA GOBLINS OUTSIDE AND ANOTHER PIC OF WOOD ELVES STOOD OVER THEIR BODIES PRESUMABLY CUT SCENES FROM THE FLIGHT TO LOTHLORIEN NONE OF THAT IS IN THE EXTENDED EDITION THOUGH SO PROBABLY JUST A PHOTO SHOOT

WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT

OH YEAH I GUESS TONS OF STUFF WAS MADE THAT NEVER MADE IT IN
I TOOK THIS PICTURE SOME YEARS BACK WHEN HOBBITON WAS BEING REBUILT FOR THE HOBBIT MOVIES I DON'T RECALL SEEING THIS IN THE MOVIES ANYWHERE DID I MISS IT
IM NOT SURE IF THEY ARE THE SAME ONES BUT YOU CAN SEE SOME BEEHIVES IN THE DESOLATION OF SMUG WHEN THEY ARE RUNNING TO HOUSE
IF THEY WERE THEY WOULD BE
THIS IS REALLY GOOD
THE MOVIE MUD PIT THING IS WEIRD AND WRONG ORCS REPRODUCE THE SAME WAY EVERYONE ELSE DOES SO IT WOULD TAKE A WHILE TO FULLY REPLENISH HIS ARMY
WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT HOW SAURURAN BRED THE CHARACTERS IN THE NOVELS SPECULATE THAT SAURURAN BRED ORCS WITH MEN TO CREATE THE AND THEY IMPLY THAT ORCS CAN BREED QUICKLY BUT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW SAURURAN CAN'T HAVE BEEN BREEDING THEM FOR MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF YEARS SINCE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO HIDE FROM THE WHITE COUNCIL IT'S POSSIBLE THAT BREEDING GROUPS OF THEM TOGETHER TOOK LONG PERIODS OF PREPARATION OR THAT SAURURAN WAS BREEDING MORE WHEN ISENGARD WAS ATTACKED BUT THEY JUST WEREN'T READY

IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE RUSHED HIS OFFENSIVE FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS BUT IT CERTAINLY SEEMED RUSHED REMEMBER THE SIEGE OF MINAS TIGRISH SARON SPENT A LOT OF TIME PREPARING FOR THAT ASSAULT AND HE USED A LOT OF DIFFERENT TACTICS FOR ITS DURATION AMONG HIS ADVANTAGES WAS TIME SIEGE LASTED A FEW DAYS AND WAS WORKING NATURALLY EVEN DESPITE THE ARRIVAL OF THE ROHIRRIM UNTIL ARAGON ARRIVED WITH THE BLACK SHIPS AND HIS REINFORCEMENTS FROM ELSEWHERE IN CONDOR COMPARE THAT TO SIEGE OF DEEP IN WHICH THE ARE INCREDIBLY AGGRESSIVE AND BASICALLY JUST RUSH THE FORTRESS WITH THEIR SIEGE ENGINES WHEN YOU'VE ENCIRCLED A CASTLE AND YOUR ENEMY IS TRAPPED INSIDE TIME IS USUALLY ON YOUR SIDE SAURURAN COULD HAVE STARVED OUT THE ROHIRRIM GIVEN ENOUGH TIME BUT MAYBE THERE WAS SOME REASON HE COULDN'T HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THERE WERE A GREAT NUMBER OF ROHIRRIM SCATTERED THROUGHOUT ROHAN UNDER DIFFERENT LEADERSHIP WHICH COULD IF MUSTERED BREAK HIS SIEGE THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY HE ACTED IN HASTE DURING THE SIEGE BUT IT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY HE CHOSE THAT TIME TO ATTACK AT ALL UNLESS YOU CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THAT SAURURAN KNEW HIS BEST CHANCE WAS TO ATTACK FAST AND HARD BEFORE HIS FOES COULD MOUNT A PROPER DEFENSIVE TO COUNTER HIM ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT SAURURAN WAS MOVING HIS FORCES IN PREPARATION TO ASSIST IMMINENT CONQUEST OF MIDDLE-EARTH AND WE CAN SEE WHY HE FELT RUSHED

SO TAKE ALL OF THAT AND THINK ABOUT POSITION HE THINKS HIS BEST CHANCE IS TO HIT HARD AND FAST IN FACT HIS MASTER DEMANDS IT SO HE EXPENDS ALL OF HIS FORCES ON A FULL OFFENSIVE THAT LASTS A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IT SEEMS UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT MORE TO HAVE BEEN BRED ONLY DURING THE ASSAULT ON DEEP AND IF SAURURAN HAD ALREADY BRED THEM THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT ALONG TO THAT BATTLE GIVEN ALL THAT IT MAKES SENSE WHY SAURURAN LOSES AND THE BREEDING OF THE IS ALMOST A
THEY WERE SOME BREED FROM ORCS AND GOBLINS OR DDK THEY COULD WAKE IN DAYLIGHT AND THEY USED ALL THEIR RESOURCES TO MAKE THE ARMY PRETTY MUCH AND THE ENTIRE ARMY OF ISENGARD GOT SENT TO HELMS DEEP AND JUST A FEW DAYS LATER THE ANTS ATTACKED ISENGARD SO THERE WASN'T A LOT OF TIME TO BUILD UP AN ARMY AGAIN
I ASSUME YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE FINAL HOBBIT I GOT THE SENSE THEY WERE TRYING TO CRAM AS MUCH EXTRA SCENERY IN AS THEY COULD BEFORE SAYING GOODBYE TO MIDDLE EARTH

AS SOMEONE WHO COULD WATCH THREE MOVIES OF NOTHING BUT MIDDLE EARTH SCENERY I DID STILL FIND THIS KIND OF OBVIOUS AND DISTRACTING
THE EXTENDED VERSION IS BETTER IN THE FINAL MINUTES OF THE FILM YOU REALLY COULD SEE WHERE THEY HAD CUT OUT MATERIAL
NICE I LOVE IT
NOT TO BE WEIRD BUT YOU'RE REALLY CUTE AND THE TATTOO IS ONLY MAKING YOU CUTER
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THE ROK TALKS ABOUT THERE BEING FARM LANDS THAT ARE WORKED BY SLAVES AND ORCS IN THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF MORDOR

I WOULD IMAGINE THAT AFTER SOME TIME MORDOR WOULD BE INHABITABLE BY NORMAL PEOPLE
WELL FOR YEARS MORDOR LAY EMPTY AND ABANDONED IN THE THIRD AGE AFTER DEFEAT BY THE LAST ALLIANCE CONDOR BUILT MANY FORTRESSES TO WATCH OVER THE BLACK LAND INCLUDING ARACH ALGREN TORCH DUNGOL AND DURTHANG I WOULD IMAGINE FOR THOSE YEARS MORDOR WAS EMPTY WITH VERY EVIL CREATURES DWELLING WITHIN ITS DESOLATE CONFINES THE DUNEDIN NO DOUBT KEPT A CLOSE WATCH ON GORGOROTH BOTH FROM ARCHHOST AND ARCHHOST AS WELL AS VIA THE PALANTIRI WHICH REMAINED SOLELY IN THEIR HANDS UNTIL WELL AFTER THE DARKWATCH WAS ABANDONED
IF WE ASSUME THE INHOSPITABLE NATURE OF THE GOROGOTH PLATEAU IS NATURAL AND NOT CAUSED BY SARON PERHAPS WE MIGHT LOOK TO THE ATACAMA DESERT IN SOUTH AMERICA

THOUGH ONLY A FEW HUNDRED MILES FROM THE PACIFIC OCEAN THIS REGION IS SITUATED BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAIN RANGES CREATING A DOUBLE RAIN SHADOW THAT CAUSE TO THE AREA TO LACK ALMOST ANY PRECIPITATION SOME AREAS HAVE NEVER EVEN RECORDED RAIN EVER IT IS THE DRIEST DESERT IN THE WORLD AND WHILE THE IS LIFE ON THE ARID FRINGES THE ARE AREAS WHERE NOTHING GROWS

NOW WHILE THE GORGOTH PLATEAU LIKELY IS NOT AS HIGH AS ELEVATION AS THE ATACAMA YOU'LL NOTICE ON ANY MAP OF MIDDLE EARTH THAT THIS AREA OF MORDOR IS ALMOST COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS THIS MEANS ALMOST NO PRECIPITATION SO NO WATER NO PLANTS NO ANIMALS NO LIFE THE FRINGES ARE LIKELY MORE ARID THAN ABSOLUTE DESERT THOSE FLIES IN MORGA HAVE TO SUBSIST ON SOMETHING BUT THE CENTRAL AREA AROUND BARAD DUR AND MOUNT DOOM ARE LIKELY FOREVER BARREN DUE TO CLIMATE
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE OK VOLCANIC SOIL IS ACTUAL SUPER FERTILE SOME OTHER COMMENTERS HAVE MENTIONED THE SEA OF NURNEN WHICH WAS BORDERED BY FERTILE FARMLAND SO WHEN MOUNT DOOM ISN'T CONSTANTLY ERUPTING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ISN'T BEING GEARED FOR WAR REMEMBER IN LOAR WE ONLY EVER SEE THE AREA AROUND WHICH WAS HOME BASE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU WANT TO SAY IT WAS AWFUL BECAUSE OF CORRUPTING PRESENCE INDUSTRIALIZATION VOLCANIC ASH FROM MOUNT DOOM ETC MORDOR IS LARGE ENOUGH THAT IT CAN'T ALL BE THE SAME GEOGRAPHICALLY
SOM IS GETTING A BAD REP HERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT GOES AGAINST THE RULE THAT MEN WERE GIFTED MORTALITY AND THAT ONLY GOD COULD CHANGE THAT BUT IT ISN'T THE FIRST TIME SARON HAS DONE SUCH A THING IN THE LOAR HE DOES THIS TO THE NAZGÛL IT ISN'T EXACTLY IMMORTALITY EITHER TALION AND THE NAGUAL ARE NO LONGER NORMAL LIVING BEINGS ALSO I THINK IT'S A CLEVER IDEA TO SEE A WRAITH FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE EVIL WHICH CREATED IT
MORIA HAD BEEN UNDER THE CONTROL OF ORCS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PREVIOUSLY BALIN LED AN EXPEDITION INTO MORIA TO ATTEMPT TO RECLAIM IT CIRCA YEARS BEFORE THE FELLOWSHIP AND THEY ONLY LASTED ABOUT YEARS BEFORE BEING OVERRUN AND KILLED GIMLI PROBABLY NEVER KNEW THE EXPEDITION HAD DIED THOUGH THE DWARVES AT THE COUNCIL OF ELROD KNEW THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG GANDALF ALMOST CERTAINLY SUSPECTED IT BECAUSE HE KNEW HOW DANGEROUS MORIA WAS
I AM SURE THAT THE GOLD JEWELLERY COMING OUT OF MORIA WOULD HAVE STOPPED

I DON'T RECALL ANY SUGGESTION THAT THEY EVER RESTARTED THEY MENTION FINDING PRECIOUS METALS INCLUDING MITHRAIC BUT NOT MUCH MORE THAN THAT

BOOK SEEMS TO INDICATE THE COLONY WAS NEVER SECURED AND WAS UNDER LOW INTENSITY ATTACK THE ENTIRE TIME IT WAS THERE UNTIL THE END WHERE IT CLEARLY STEPPED UP

SO AFTER SMUG TAKES ERECTOR GRANDFATHER LEAD THE DWARVES TO RETAKE MORIA AGAINST THE INHABITING GOBLINS I BELIEVE THEY WON AT HEAVY COST AND COULDN'T AFFORD TO TAKE THE ENTIRE CITY GRANDFATHER DIES AND HIS FATHER GOES DELIRIOUS AND STARTS WANDERING THORIN LEAD THE REMAINDER OF HIS PEOPLE TO LIVE A LIFE AS SIMPLE BLACKSMITHS AND WORKERS UNTIL HE GETS COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT A RECLAMATION OF ERECTOR

MORIA WAS LATER RECLAIMED BY BALIN HOWEVER MORIA STILL HAD ORCS BALIN WAS SHOT BY ONE AND HIS PARTY SLAUGHTERED COMMUNICATIONS HAD CEASED GIMLI WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT HE WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT GANDALF RIGHTFULLY FEARED THAT THE WORST HAD HAPPENED NO ONE KNEW THE FATE OF BALIN UNTIL THE FELLOWSHIP SHOWED UP
GANDALF DIDN'T MAKE BOMBS LIKE THE ONE SAURURAN MADE BECAUSE SAURURAN DID NOT MAKE BOMBS YOU'VE RUN INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF ACTIONS CHARACTERS TAKE IN THE MOVIES THAT SO MUCH OF THOSE ACTIONS ARE INVENTED FOR THE FILMS

SAURURAN DID NOT MAKE A BOMB NOT IN THE SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE IMAGINING HAVING SEEN IT IN THE SECOND FILM NOT SOMETHING WITH A RECIPE WHAT SAURURAN DID IS THROUGH SOME VAGUE AND ILL-DEFINED MEANS MANAGE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A RELATIVELY COMPARING TO WHAT YOU RECALL FROM THE MOVIES SMALL HOLE BEING MADE AROUND THE DRAINAGE GATE FROM THE STREAM THAT RAN UNDER THE WALL THIS DRAINAGE GATE WAS WIDE ENOUGH FOR ORCS TO HAVE CRAWLED THROUGH IT TO GET BEHIND THE WALL EARLIER IN THE BATTLE AND HAD BEEN PLUGGED WITH STONES BY THE DEFENDERS

WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CULVERT GATE FIRE OF ORTHANT DEVILRY OF SAURURAN THIS IS WHAT THE CHARACTERS WHO ALSO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED CALL IT IT IS VAGUE TZOLKIN LIKED BEING VAGUE ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS AND MAGIC WAS ONE OF THEM FOR ALL WE KNOW SAURURAN GAVE THE ORCS A BOX HE HAD SPENT THE LAST TEN YEARS WHISPERING BOOM TO AS HE FELL ASLEEP NOTE NOT HOW MAGIC WORKS IN MIDDLE-EARTH MAYBE IT WAS SOME TYPE OF CHEMICAL OR ALCHEMICAL EXPLOSIVE

WHEN THE FILMS DECIDE TO FOCUS ON ONE OF THOSE ILL-DEFINED THINGS AND MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT AS THEY DID HERE WITH THAT OLYMPIC TORCH NONSENSE AND EXAGGERATE IT AS THEY DID HERE WITH THE WALL BEING CLOVEN IN TOO AND PEOPLE FLYING IN THE AIR AND SCREAMING THEIR DEATH WAILS YOU CAN ONLY REALLY TAKE IT AS IT IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT SELF-CONTAINED ONCE YOU START ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE WHY NO ONE ELSE EVER DECIDED TO MAKE BOMBS THE ONLY REAL ANSWER IS TO FORCE YOURSELF TO IGNORE IT OTHERWISE YOU GET COMPOUND INVENTION AND THE WHOLE SECONDARY INTERPRETATION OF THE WORLD FALLS APART
ANOTHER ANSWER REGARDING THE BOMBS IS THAT TZOLKIN WAS A STAUNCH ENVIRONMENTALIST TO HIM INDUSTRY AND MODERNIZATION AT THE EXPENSE OF NATURE AND TRADITIONAL VALUES WAS EVIL THIS IS WHY THE SHIRE IS GOOD AND SAUMON IS EVIL WITH HIS MASS PRODUCTION OF WEAPONS ARMOR AND EVEN LIFE

BOMBS COULD BE SEEN AS SOMEWHAT UNNATURAL AND THIS IS WHY THE CORRUPTED SAUMON USED THEM IF GANDALF USED THEM AS WELL HE WOULD BE NO BETTER

THIS ALSO SOMEWHAT EXPLAINS WHY TECHNOLOGY WENT MOSTLY UNCHANGED IN YEARS IN MIDDLE-EARTH

IN THE BIBLE PSALMS YES I KNOW TZOLKIN WAS A SOLDIER AND SURELY USED GRENADES AND THE LIKE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE COULDN'T STILL FEEL THIS WAY
PAGE SOUTH ALSO WHY DIDN'T HE USE MAGIC THAT MUCH DURING THE GANDALF THE WHITE SCENE HE SEEMS TO HAVE REALLY STRONG MAGICAL ABILITIES SHIELDING FROM AXES ARROWS MAKING SWORDS HEAT UP ON A DISTANCE WHY NOT DO THE SAME TO THE ORKS OR DOES IT WORK ONLY WITH A SINGLE PERSON THE ONE IN FOCUS

SINCERELY LOOKING FOR ANSWERS IF THERE ARE ANY NOT A TROLL I PROMISE
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR INFORMATIVE REPLIES REALLY CLEARED UP THINGS FOR ME
LIKE WE HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THERE WERE NO BOMBS IN THE BOOKS
BUT SAY THERE WERE
I DON'T THINK GANDALF WOULD HAVE KNOWN HOW TO MAKE BOMBS BECAUSE HE WASN'T AS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT CREATING THINGS AS SAUMON GANDALF IS A MAIA WHO FOLLOWED THE VALA SIENNA SIENNA MOURNED FOR ALL THE EVIL IN MIDDLE EARTH AND TURNED SORROW INTO WISDOM THAT'S WHY GANDALF IS SO WISE HE SPENT ALL HIS TIME WITH ONE OF THE MOST WISE ALAR BEFORE HE WAS SENT TO MIDDLE EARTH
BUT SAUMON IS A MAIA WHO FOLLOWED AUL THE VALA WHO LOVED THE EARTH AND CREATED THINGS AUL IS LIKE THE MAIN CRAFTSMEN OF THE ALAR HE ACTUALLY CREATED THE DWARVES SO SAUMON WOULD HAVE A MIND TO CREATE AND CONTROL
SO JUST BECAUSE GANDALF IS A WIZARD I DON'T THINK HE WAS A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ABOUT CREATING STUFF
YOU CLEARLY NEVER READ LOAR
PERHAPS HE NEEDS CALM AND LESS DISTRACTION TO PULL OFF THE GOOD MAGIC MAYBE IN THE ORC FIGHTS HE DOESN'T WANT TO BLOW HIS MAGICAL LOAD SO TO SPEAK THEN BE LIMP FOR WHEN THE BIG BOYS COME TO PLAY SEEMS TO ME HE DOES SOME PRETTY SPIFF STUFF AT NEED LIKE LOCKING THE DOOR ON THE BARONG AND BLASTING THE NAGUAL WITH WHITE BIZZ WHEN THEY ARE ATTACKING FARAMIR

I MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT HE KNEW THE RECIPE FOR THE BOMBS
BOY I SURE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM POSTED ALL OVER THIS SUB TEN THOUSAND TIMES
REMEMBER THEY WON'T BE BOBBLEHEADS HE ONLY REASON STAR WARS AND MARVEL ONES HAVE TO BE BOBBLEHEADED IS BECAUSE OF THE EXISTING HASBRO ACTION FIGURE LICENSE THESE WILL BE REGULAR ONES JUST LIKE THE OTHER LOAR HOBBIT ONES BUNKO HAS MADE

PERSONALLY I'LL BE PASSING ON THESE SINCE I'M OUT OF THE BUNKO GAME
THE REAL QUESTION IS DO THEY HUNT THE DEMASMEAGOL OR THE SMAUGAGORGON

OME IF HE COMES TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA NEXT I'LL FLIP
I HOPE HE COMES TO ISU
COOL IS HE LEARNING TEACHING OR JUST VISITING
IS IT ME OR DOES IT LOOK LIKE SAM WISE IS PACKING
REMOVED
SEEMS LIKE A LOGICAL NEXT STEP
DID YOU READ THE APPENDICES TOO AT LEAST READ APPENDIX A
I GUESS I SHOULD READ THEM TOO THEN
I WOULD HAVE READ THE HOBBIT FIRST THEN THE LOAR BUT IT IS FINE YOU CAN READ THE HOBBIT NEXT THEN ONTO THE SILMARILLION DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE APPENDICES IN THE LOAR I WOULD READ THAT AFTER THE HOBBIT THOUGH IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT BY NOW
WHY DID YOU CRY
SAURURAN THE AELLA CHILL
NICE
WOW THAT'S SERIOUSLY GOOD
A LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF THIS TITLE IS ODD
THE OLD IMAGES OF THE HOBBITS ALWAYS CRACK ME UP GOOD FIND
THOSE ARE GREAT THEY LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO THE CHARACTERS IN THE OLD ANIMATED MOVIES DO THEY HAVE A DATE STAMP ON THE BOTTOMS AT ALL
I CAN'T FIGURE THIS OUT CAN YOU FIND A BANANA PLEASE
IT WASNT FILMED USING CAMERAS SUITED FOR 3D SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CREATED 3D WHICH PROBABLY WOULDN'T LOOK GREAT

PROBABLY NOT
IF IT IS POSSIBLE AND IT WOULD MAKE MORE MONEY THEN PROBABLY
OK HERE'S THE DEAL

SEEING AS THE MOST WIDELY ACCEPTED THEORY OF HOW THE ORCS CAME INTO BEING IS BEING TORTURED ELVES BY MELIOR

BEING WIDELY ACCEPTED DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE IT THE MOST ACCURATE

THAT THEORY IS THE MOST WIDELY ACCEPTED SIMPLY BECAUSE IT APPEARS IN VAGUE TERMS IN THE MOST WIDELY KNOW BOOK OF THOSE THAT MENTION ORC ORCINS ANYWAY IN OTHER WORDS IT'S MORE WIDELY ACCEPTED THAN OTHER IDEAS BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE HAVE READ JUST THE SILMARILLION THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WENT THROUGH ALL VOLUMES OF HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH

FOR TZOLKIN IN HIS LATER LIFE HOWEVER ORCS FROM ELVES WAS BASICALLY JUST A REJECTED IDEA ALONG WITH MELIOR CREATING ORCS FROM NOTHING FROM STONE ORC MORTALITY IMMORTALITY PLAYED A PART IN THIS

ORCS

THEIR NATURE AND ORIGIN REQUIRE MORE THOUGHT THEY ARE NOT EASY
TO WORK INTO THE THEORY AND SYSTEM
AS THE CASE OF ABLE AND THE DWARVES SHOWS ONLY ERU
COULD MAKE CREATURES WITH INDEPENDENT WILLS AND WITH REASONING
POWERS BUT ORCS SEEM TO HAVE BOTH THEY CAN TRY TO CHEAT
MORGOTH SARON REBEL AGAINST HIM OR CRITICIZE HIM
2 THEREFORE THEY MUST BE CORRUPTIONS OF SOMETHING

BUT MEN HAD NOT YET APPEARED WHEN THE ORCS ALREADY
EXISTED ABLE CONSTRUCTED THE DWARVES OUT OF HIS MEMORY OF THE
MUSIC BUT ERU WOULD NOT SANCTION THE WORK OF MELIOR SO AS TO
ALLOW THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE ORCS NOT UNLESS ORCS WERE
ULTIMATELY REMEDIABLE OR COULD BE AMENDED AND SAVED
IT ALSO SEEMS CLEAR SEE FIBROID AND WANDRETH THAT THOUGH
MELIOR COULD UTTERLY CORRUPT AND RUIN INDIVIDUALS IT IS NOT
POSSIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE HIS ABSOLUTE PERVERSION OF A WHOLE
PEOPLE OR GROUP OF PEOPLES AND HIS MAKING THAT STATE
HERITABLE 2 ADDED LATER THIS LATTER MUST IF A FACT BE AN ACT OF
ERU
IN THAT CASE ELVES AS A SOURCE ARE VERY UNLIKELY AND ARE ORCS
IMMORTAL IN THE ELVISH SENSE OR TROLLS IT SEEMS CLEARLY
IMPLIED IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS THAT TROLLS EXISTED IN THEIR OWN
RIGHT BUT WERE TINKERED WITH BY MELIOR
WHAT OF TALKING BEASTS AND BIRDS WITH REASONING AND
SPEECH THESE HAVE BEEN RATHER LIGHTLY ADOPTED FROM LESS
SERIOUS MYTHOLOGIES BUT PLAY A PART WHICH CANNOT NOW BE
EXCISED

BUT AGAIN WOULD ERU PROVIDE FEAR SOULS FOR SUCH CREATURES FOR
THE EAGLES ETC PERHAPS BUT NOT FOR ORCS




MOREOVER THE ORCS CONTINUED TO LIVE AND BREED AND TO CARRY
ON THEIR BUSINESS OF RAVAGING AND PLUNDERING AFTER MORGOTH WAS
OVERTHROWN THEY HAD OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INCARNATES
ALSO THEY HAD LANGUAGES OF THEIR OWN AND SPOKE AMONG
THEMSELVES IN VARIOUS TONGUES ACCORDING TO DIFFERENCES OF BREED
THAT WERE DISCERNIBLE AMONG THEM THEY NEEDED FOOD AND DRINK
AND REST THOUGH MANY WERE BY TRAINING AS TOUGH AS DWARVES IN
ENDURING HARDSHIP THEY COULD BE SLAIN AND THEY WERE SUBJECT
TO DISEASE BUT APART FROM THESE ILLS THEY DIED AND WERE NOT
IMMORTAL EVEN ACCORDING TO THE MANNER OF THE QUENDA INDEED
THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN BY NATURE SHORT-LIVED COMPARED WITH
THE SPAN OF MEN OF HIGHER RACE SUCH AS THE DAIN

RING EMPHASIS MINE

YET DESPITE THIS LAST QUOTE WE SEE AGOG WHO LIVES WELL BEYOND THE SPAN OF THE DAIN UNLESS TZOLKIN MEANT DAIN THE LIKES OF ELROD THEN AGAIN THE HOBBIT AT ITS INCEPTIONS WAS NEVER INTENDED TO REALLY BE A PART OF THE LEGENDARIUM SO IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THIS QUIRK CAN JUST BE DISCARDED

IN TRUTH AN ORC ORIGIN WAS NEVER FIRMLY DECIDED UPON THEIR MORTALITY AND NATURE REDEEMABLE VS IRREDEEMABLE WERE BIG ISSUES THOUGH LATER WRITINGS LEAN TOWARDS MORTAL AND A REARRANGING OF THE TIMELINE TO HAVE MEN AWAKE EARLY SO THAT THEY COULD BE A SOURCE
NO THEY'RE NOT IMMORTAL THERE IS NOT MUCH ABOUT THEIR LIVES OR LIFESTYLE BUT IF THEY WERE IMMORTAL I'M SURE WE WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT
THEY AREN'T IMMORTAL TZOLKIN WROTE IN AN ESSAY THAT ORCS HAD A SHORT LIFESPAN COMPARED TO THE NÚMENÓREANS
THEY'RE CORRUPTED ELVES SO YEAH
WHAT NUMBER
SLIGHTLY OFF TOPIC BUT DON'T LET ANYONE CONVINCE YOU THAT IS A GOOD REPLACEMENT FOR BREAST MILK
THAT'S AWESOME I WISH I FOLLOWED TWITTER ENOUGH TO ENJOY THIS LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE A FACEBOOK PAGE BUT IT HASN'T DONE POSTS THERE SINCE
BRIAN BLESSED FOR BOTH
DANNY DEVITO AND KAITLIN OLSON CLEARLY NO OTHER CHOICE
TOM BOBADIL WOULD HAVE TO BE THE LATE GREAT ROBIN WILLIAMS NO CLUE ON GOLDBERRY THOUGH
IT'S A TOUGH ONE TO FIGURE OUT BUT I THINK I WOULD HAVE CAST JASON FLEMING AS TOM BOBADIL SAW HIM RECENTLY IN PRIMEVAL AND HE HAD THIS SORT OF MISCHIEVOUS QUALITY TO HIM THAT MADE ME THINK HE'D BE GOOD FOR BOBADIL WITH WIG BEARD AND MAYBE PROSTHETICS AS PER USUAL LOAR FILM PROCEDURE FOR GOLDBERRY I'D CAST EMILY KINNEY TODAY BUT SHE'D HAVE BEEN TOO YOUNG PROBABLY BACK IN LOL
JACK BLACK AS TOM BOBADIL BOUNCING AROUND SINGING ALL THE TIME SILLY BUT WITH A CERTAIN INTENSITY AND HE'S WORKED WITH P BEFORE
DELETED
JEFF BRIDGES AND PERHAPS MIA WASIKOWSKA OR SATIRISE RONAN
BRIAN BLESSED FOR TOM

NATALIE DORMER FOR GOLDBERRY
I THINK ELIZABETH OLSON OR MISTY DAY LILY RABE COULD PLAY GOLDBERRY AS FOR TOM BOBADIL I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAPPY IF IT WERE STEPHEN COLBERT HIMSELF INCLUDED
I'M GOING TO STEP OUTSIDE THE ACTING SPHERE AND ACTUALLY CAST ANDREW BIRD AS TOM GOLDBERRY HELL LET'S KEEP IT INDIE WITH JOANNA NEWSOME
JOHN GOODMAN AS TOM BOBADIL
I MIGHT GIVE JOHN A THIRD CHARACTER HE'S ALREADY GIMLI AND TREEBEARD BUT I THINK HE'D MAKE A GREAT TOM BOBADIL AS WELL
PETER JACKSON AS TOM BOBADIL NO QUESTION
IS THERE REALLY ANY QUESTION AS TO WHO WILL ULTIMATELY WIN THIS THING
I'M TEMPTED TO STICKY THIS SO WE CAN USE THE COMMUNITY HELP PUSH GANDALF THROUGH TO WIN
I BET THE FINAL WILL BE GANDALF VS MALEFICENT
ONLY PEOPLE I SEE THAT WOULD GIVE GANDALF A RUN FOR HIS MONEY ARE MURZA AND RAISTLIN
YOU SHALL NOT PASS


IRONIC GIVEN THE WHOLE POWER VS MAGIC SITUATION
LOOKS LIKE HE'S CRUSHING THIS ROUND TOO
I'D CERTAINLY PUT DUMBLEDORE OVER SABRINA THE WITCH
IT'S GOTTA BE HOWARD SHORE HE DID SO WELL WITH LOAR BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE COULD HAVE DONE HE'S THE ONLY PERSON IN MY MIND THAT STANDS A CHANCE

ZIMMER AND TREVOR JONES WOULD BE A CLOSE FIGHT FOR A DISTANT SECOND PLACE IMO
HOWARD SHORE IS THE OBVIOUS ANSWER HOWEVER I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT JEREMY SOULE COULD DO JUST AS GOOD A JOB

IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH HIS WORKS LISTEN TO THE SOUNDTRACKS OF THE LAST THREE ELDER SCROLLS GAMES HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT FANTASY IS SUPPOSED TO SOUND LIKE AND HIS MUSIC CAN MAKE THE HAIR STAND UP ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK AND GIVE YOU SOME SERIOUS FEELS
I MEAN HOWARD SHORE THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION
I THINK HOWARD SHORE COULD DEFINITELY PULL IT OFFICIAL HECK I CAN'T PROVE IT BUT I THINK HE READ THE SILMARILLION BEFORE WRITING THE MUSIC FOR LOAR THE OARFISH THEMES IN HIS WORK SOUND LIKE DESCRIPTION OF SONG IN THE AINULINDALE
AND IT SEEMED AT LAST THAT THERE WERE TWO MUSICS PROGRESSING AT ONE TIME BEFORE THE SEAT OF ILÚVATAR AND THEY WERE UTTERLY AT VARIANCE ONE WAS DEEP AND WIDE AND BEAUTIFUL BUT SLOW AND BLENDED WITH AN IMMEASURABLE SORROW FROM WHICH ITS BEAUTY CHIEFLY CAME THE OTHER HAD NOW ACHIEVED A UNITY OF ITS OWN BUT IT WAS LOUD AND VAIN AND ENDLESSLY REPEATED AND IT HAD LITTLE HARMONY BUT RATHER A CLAMOROUS UNISON AS OF MANY TRUMPETS BRAYING UPON A FEW NOTES

DETHKLOK WHO IS MORE METAL THAN MELIOR
I THINK NOBODY COULD DO IT BETTER THAN SHORE BUT JEREMY SOULE AND TILMAN SILLESCU WOULD BE MY BACKUP CHOICES
BLIND GUARDIAN THEY DID A SIMARILLION ALBUM NIGHTFALL IN MIDDLE EARTH AND WERE APPARENTLY BEING CONSIDERED FOR THE MOVIE SOUNDTRACKS BEFORE SHORE
HOWARD SHORE WOULD BE GREAT OBVIOUSLY BUT I WILL ALSO GIVE A NOD TO RAMIN DJAWADI I MEAN HIS WORK ON GAME OF THRONES WAS TRANSCENDENT


I LOVE HOWARD SHORE BUT MY VOTE FOR THE SILMARILLION WOULD BE MARTIN ROMBERG HE EXCELS AT CREATING COMPOSITIONS FOR ELVISH SONGS LIKE A ELBERETH GILTHONIEL
NOT TO SUBVERT THE QUESTION BUT I WOULD TRULY RATHER IT BE SOMEBODY I HAVEN'T HEARD ALREADY THERE ARE SO MANY TALENTED COMPOSERS OUT THERE IT'S REALLY UNBELIEVABLE WE SHOULD GIVE MORE NEW TALENT A CHANCE INSTEAD OF HYPING THE SAME FOUR OR FIVE GUYS THAT EVERYBODY ALREADY KNOWS FROM THE STUFF THEY'VE ALREADY DONE IN THE POPULAR FANTASY SCI-FI THAT WE ALREADY LIKE

BUT IF I HAD TO CHOOSE A COMPOSER I ALREADY KNOW I'D HAVE TO SAY THAT I'D BE INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT IVAN TORRENT WOULD BRING TO THE PROJECT
ERU ILLUVATAR

I HAVE TO ADMIT WHEN I READ THE OPENING OF THE BOOK I ALWAYS THINK OF BACH'S ST JOHN PASSION OPENING
HOWARD SHORE BUT IF I HAD TO PICK A SECOND JEREMY SOULE FOR HIS INSANE ELDER SCROLLS SOUNDTRACKS THAT SHIT IS MAJESTIC AS FUCK
NOBUO UEMATSU
MY CHOICES WOULD ALSO BE HOWARD SHORE JEREMY SOULE HAS ALSO BEEN MENTIONED BY A FEW PEOPLE TO AND I HAVE TO AGREE
MY VOTE WOULD BE FOR ANYONE BUT HANS ZIMMER
I WOULD LOVE TO COMPOSE IT SAYING AS IT JUST AS LIKELY THAT I WILL COMPOSE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE AS IT IS FOR THE TZOLKIN ESTATE TO RELEASE THE RIGHTS

THAT BEING SAID IF IT WAS FILMED THEY WOULD FILM THE WHOLE BOOK THEY WOULD FILM CHILDREN OF AURIN OR THE LAY OF BEDIN AND LUTHIER AND EVEN THEN THOSE STORY LINES WOULD BE COMPRESSED TO MAKE IT A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT COULD EARN A RATE OF RETURN THAT WOULD MAKE IT A GOOD BUSINESS VENTURE
JONNY GREENWOOD
I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT ALEXANDRE DISPLAT COULD DO WITH IT PURELY BASED ON HIS WORK ON TREE OF LIFE


JUSTIN BELL

HE MAY TEND TO BORROW QUITE A BIT FROM SHORE BUT I'M A HUGE FAN OF WHAT HE DID WITH THE PILLARS OF ETERNITY SCORE

THE SONG I LINKED TO FREAKS ME OUT BY HOW MUCH IT IS ABLE TO INSPIRE MY COLD DEAD HORRIBLE TERRIBLE BLACK VENGEFUL HEART
SHORE TO ME IT SEEMED LINE THE SCORE HE CREATED WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD HAVE WENT WITH THE MOTION PICTURES I THINK I LOVE THE SCORE MORE THAN THE MOVIES THEMSELVES BUT IF HE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO IT THEN HANS ZIMMER FOR SURE

JORIS DE MANUAL

DUDE IS AN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE MODERN COMPOSER WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING THAT WORLD TO LIFE THROUGH MUSIC

PAUL ANTHONY ROMERO
THOMAS BERGENSEN
DANNY ELFMAN SCORE WITH INCIDENTALS BY MARK MOTHERSBAUGH ALSO THE FILM SHOULD BE ENTIRELY ANALOG STOP MOTION A LA CORALINE
HOWARD SHORE FEATURING SIGUR RAS
FUCK THAT A SILMARILLION MOVIE WOULD PROBABLY BE THE SHITTIEST FILM EVER MADE
I HAVE TO GO WITH HARRELL YOU HEARD THAT DESPICABLE ME SCORE RIGHT
FOR THIS PIECE THE COMPOSER NEEDS A GENERAL OUTLINE AND THEN THE MOVIE SHOULD BE CONSTRUCTED AROUND THE MUSIC I THINK THE SILMARILLION WOULD WORK BETTER AS AN ANIMATED SERIES ANIME NOT DISNEY

BUT I WOULD KILL TO SEE A VERSION OF THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN
IF THERE ARE THEY HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH RESEARCH

TZOLKIN SPECIFICALLY SAYS ERU IS NOWHERE EMBODIED WITHIN THE STORY
I DISAGREE ON BOTH COUNTS WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVATION FOR THE CHANGES TO CHARACTER I STILL DON'T LIKE THEM THE ARAGON WHO MADE A MEASURED DECISION TO LOOK INTO THE PALANTIR AND TO TAKE THE PATHS OF THE DEAD DOESN'T SEEM AT ALL LIKE THE ARAGON WHO IS UNCERTAIN OF HIS DESTINY JUST A LITTLE WHILE IN MOVIE TIME EARLIER

I HATE THE CHANGES TO CHARACTER AND FIND THEM COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY I HAVE TO SKIP A SIGNIFICANT SECTION OF THE TWO TOWERS BECAUSE I CAN'T WATCH HIM DRAGGING FRODO AND SAM TO MINAS TIGRISH THE WHOLE POINT OF FARAMIR FROM A NARRATIVE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT HE'S BETTER THAN BOOMIER IN EVERY WAY THAT MATTERS FOR BEING A LEADER WISDOM PATIENCE STRENGTH OF WILL MORALITY PLANNING SKILLS PEOPLE SKILLS CHOOSING THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR A GIVEN OBEDIENCE YET BOOMIER IS THE FAVORED SON WHAT GOOD IS FARAMIR AS A CHARACTER IF HE'S EVEN WORSE THAN BOOMIER FAVORITISM AND ISN'T AS OBVIOUSLY WRONG WHEN FARAMIR IS SO WEAK AND WISH-WASHY

PLUS MOVIE FARAMIR ISN'T NEARLY AWESOME ENOUGH FOR ELWYN BUT BOOK FARAMIR IS
I DEFINITELY ENJOYED THE WAY ARAGON AND ARWEN WERE FLESHED OUT MORE IN THE FILMS GOOD CALL ON P TO PUSH BACK ACTUAL KING ARC AND THE REFORGING OF THE SWORD TO ROK

I'M NOT A FAN OF WHAT THEY DID TO FARAMIR THOUGH MOVIE FARAMIR IS MORE THAN FLAWED HE'S DOWNRIGHT USELESS HE DIDN'T REALLY MAKE A SINGLE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION ANYWHERE IN THE MOVIES AND WAS ESSENTIALLY JUST A WEAK VERSION OF BOOMIER ALL OF NEGATIVE TRAITS WITHOUT ANY OF THE POSITIVE EVEN HIS REDEMPTION WHEN HE LETS FRODO GO IS KIND OF WEAKENED BY THE FACT THAT HE ALREADY WASTED SO MUCH OF TIME IT'S LIKE OH YOU LET US GO WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE SO IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT YOU DRAGGED US TO A WAR ZONE FULL OF ORCS AND NAGUAL AND NOW WE'RE MILES OFF OUR PATH AND WE WERE DELAYED FOR DAYS THANKS BRO REALLY APPRECIATE IT

IN THE BOOKS FARAMIR IS A VERY DISTINCT CHARACTER FROM BOOMIER HELPS FRODO OUT AND IT HELPS CEMENT THE FACT THAT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HUMANS AREN'T COMPLETELY BEYOND HOPE AFTER ALL THAT NOT EVERYBODY OUT THERE IS HUNGRY FOR POWER
IN THE BOOKS ARAGON HAD BEEN PROVING HIMSELF IN VARIOUS ENDEAVORS OVER THE YEARS HE WAS A GREAT LEADER OF MEN BY LAND OR BY SEA THE STEWARDS SUCH AS SERVING UNDER FATHER HENGEL AND WORKING UNDER FATHER ECTHELION LINES

ARAGON THE GREATEST TRAVELLER AND HUNTSMAN OF THIS AGE OF THE WORLD THE SHADOW OF THE PAST

IN CONDOR STRENGTH IN A KING WAS A BIG DEAL WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS EÄRNIL LL WAS TAKEN OVER ARVEDUI OF ARTHEDAIN FOR KING THE CHARACTERS DO HAVE THEIR FLAWS GANDALF BERATES FRODO FOR WISHING GOLLUM HAD BEEN KILLED GANDALF HAD BEEN DECEIVED BY SAURURAN THEOWMEN TOO AND DENETHOR WAS A BIT HARD ON FARAMIR BOOMIER COULD NOT EXCEPT THE IDEA OF TRYING TO DESTROY THE RING
AS A I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE CHANGES TO ARAGON AND FARAMIR WERE LARGELY UNNECESSARY AND PLAYED MORE POORLY THAN THE REST OF THE ADAPTATIONS I NEVER REALLY BOUGHT ARAGON AS A HESITANT KING BECAUSE THE ARAGON I GREW UP KNOWING WAS ONLY WAITING FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT TO STEP INTO HIS DESTINY IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE HOW SOMEONE WHO PERHAPS SAW THE FILMS FIRST FOUND IT AN INTEGRAL PART OF HIS CHARACTER INSTEAD OF OBVIOUSLY
IM ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIKES BOTH VERSIONS I DO LIKE THE CHANGES TO ARAGON IN PARTICULAR
I ONLY RECENTLY FINISHED THE BOOKS AND MOVIE FARAMIR IS FOREVER RUINED NOW
GANDALF WAS REFERRING TO THE RINGS THAT SARON CORRUPTED I EAST THE NINE AND THE SEVEN SARON NEVER TOUCHED THE ELDEN RINGS BUT HAD TO PUT THE MAJORITY OF HIS POWER INTO THE ONE IN ORDER TO CONTROL WHAT WAS DONE WITH THEM

SO THE THREE COULD BE TAKEN OFF AND THROWN AWAY IF THEIR OWNERS WERE OF A MIND TO DO SO THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF RING WAS BIRDMAN THE SHIPWRIGHT WHO GAVE IT TO GANDALF TO USE WITH HIS WORK AGAINST SARON
I'M PRETTY SURE GANDALF WAS JUST REFERRING TO THE ONE RING AND NOT ALL THE RINGS BUT I COULD BE WRONG
THE EXTENDED EDITIONS ARE GREAT I'VE NEVER GONE BACK MYSELF THE FILMS ARE SUBTITLED AND NOT DUBBED HERE IN SCANDINAVIA SO I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THE ENGLISH VOICES AND I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED WHEN GERMAN FRIENDS TOLD ME IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND A CINEMA THAT SHOWED THE HOBBIT IN ENGLISH I KNEW DUBBING WAS A THING IN GERMAN BUT NOT THAT IT WAS THE NORM

HOPE YOU ENJOY IT
I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING AT DER HERR DER RINGE
HAVE FUN
AW MAN YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THE EXTENDED VERSIONS ESPECIALLY THE LORD OF THE RINGS HAVE A GREAT TIME AND MAKE SURE TO ALSO WATCH THE SPECIAL FEATURES
I HAD TO PURCHASE ALL EXCEPT THE HOBBIT FOR A CLASS I'M TAKING BEST COLLEGE COURSE EVER
I HAVE THAT DICTIONARY OH GOODNESS THE ARTWORK IS JUST LOVELY
JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT DAVID DAY IS NOT HIGHLY REGARDED FOR HIS RELIABILITY TO PUT IT KINDLY THE ART ASIDE FROM THE LUNGS MAP IS GENERALLY GOOD THOUGH

I HAVE THAT SAME COPY OF LOAR MAKES FOR A GREAT VOLUME READING COPY
AWESOME I HAVE THE EXACT SAME GREY BOOK AS YOU DO AND IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IT WAS REALLY MY STEPPING POINT INTO LOAR AS IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER TO READ ALL AT ONCE INSTEAD OF AS SEPARATE BOOKS
THOSE LOOK NICE
NICE WHERE CAN I GET THESE I'VE SEEN THIS STYLE OF BOOK AT COSTCO BEFORE IS THAT WHERE YOU GOT THEM
I HAVE THE DICTIONARY I WANT THE ATLAS NEXT
THOSE COVERS ARE BEAUTIFUL ARE THEY PART OF A SET I'VE NEVER SEEN COVERS LIKE THAT BEFORE
I HAVE THAT VERSION OF THE BOOK TOO
ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN GET THAT COPY OF LOAR I THINK IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
DAAAAAAAAMN
DAVID DAY IS MY FAVORITE COMPANION AUTHOR TO THE MIDDLE-EARTH RELATED BOOKS NOT TO MENTION HIS COVERS ARE FRIGGED AMAZING
MOD NOTE PLEASE RESIST THE URGE TO REPORT THIS JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE IT DOWN VOTE AND MOVE ON OKAY AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT LAY OFF THE STUPID COMMENTS ABOUT HIPSTERS AND NERDS IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU LOOK SUPERIOR JUST JEALOUS
IF YOU GET A CHANCE DO THE WETA TOUR IN WELLINGTON YOU WON'T REGRET IT WE DID IT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
THE FACT THAT IT ONLY GOES FEET BACK DIRT FLOOR ETC SEEMS LIKE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY

HOW MUCH WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PAY TO HONEYMOON IN A FULLY FURNISHED HOBBIT HOLE FROM LOAR
NEED BOAR PICTURES
I REMEMBER BEING KNOCKED OVER BY HOW BEAUTIFUL NZ IS CONSIDERING ANYONE ELSE ESPECIALLY TODAY WOULD HAVE SHOT MOST OF THOSE FILMS ON A GREEN SCREEN I CAN'T IMAGINE THEM BEING MADE ANYWHERE ELSE IT WAS DIALED UP FOR THE MOVIE BUT NEW ZEALAND JUST LOOKS LIKE THAT IT'S AMAZING IF YOU GET DOWN TO CANTERBURY THE EDORA LOCATION IS EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS ON SCREEN JUST WITH MORE CATTLE
WHAT DOES THE INSIDE OF IT LOOK LIKE I'VE BEEN SO CURIOUS
THE TOUR THAT WE WENT ON HAD A FAMILY WITH SMALL KIDS MAYBE AND KIDS THEY WERE TURDS RUNNING IN AND ON THE GARDENS TRYING TO GET INTO THE HOBBIT HOLES ETC

AFTER WE STOPPED BY THE BAR AND GOT MY COMPLIMENTARY MEAD AND CIDER MY WIFE DOESNT DRINK SO I GOT HERS TOO I HAD THE IDEA THAT I WOULD FART ON ONE OF THE KIDS HEADS IT WASNT AS EPIC AS THE FAMOUS REDDIN VERS I ON OF THE SAME ACT BUT THEY BLAMED EACH OTHER AND I FELT SATISFIED

MY WIFE WAS ALSO IMPRESSED LET ME PUT MY MEAD N CIDER
MAN I LIVE IN NEW ZEALAND AND I HAVEN'T EVEN VISITED YET MAYBE I'LL TREAT MYSELF NEXT HOLIDAYS WITH A TRIP THERE
I LIVE IN NEW ZEALAND AND THIS IS STILL ON MY BUCKET LIST
I FEEL LIKE I WOULD JUST START UNCONTROLLABLY SOBBING
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL ALL ACROSS NZ SEEKING OUT AS MANY LOAR FILM LOCATIONS AS POSSIBLE

IT WAS AMAZING TO NOT ONLY SEE ALL OF THESE UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL LOCATIONS IN PERSON BUT TO IMAGINE ALL THE CARAVANS OF CAMERA CREWS AND TRAILERS AND CREW TRAVELING FAR AND WIDE TO REACH SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE TREK OUT TO MOUNT SUNDAY LOCATION FOR EDORA WAS DOWN A LONG DIRT ROAD SO I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY EVEN BOTHERED BUT ALL THESE LOCATIONS CLEARLY PAID OFF FOR THE EPIC SHOTS

I ALSO LOVED EXPERIENCING WHAT THE CREW AND ACTORS AND STUNT DOUBLES LIKELY WENT THROUGH WALKING THESE AREAS IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO GO TO NZ EVER YOU'LL QUICKLY REALIZE THE SECOND YOU STEP OFF THE ROAD AND WALK ACROSS THE FIELDS OF NZ YOU GET STUCK BY ALL KINDS OF BURRS AND THORNY BUSHES IT'S INSANE HOW PRICKLY THE LANDSCAPE IS AND ALL THOSE GORGEOUS GREEN ROLLING HILLS ARE SO INVITING BUT YOU WALK ACROSS THEM AND REALIZE THEY ARE RIDDLED WITH SHEEP POOP

EXPERIENCING WHAT THE ACTORS AND CREW LIKELY WENT THROUGH FIRST-HAND WAS JUST AWESOME I WOULDN'T TRADE IT

EDIT ADDED A LINK TO SOME PHOTOS AND WORDS I WROTE ON THE POOPSIE FIELDS OF NZ
SO S ON MY BUCKET LIST TOO
SERIOUSLY NOW IS IT WORTH THE TRIP BECAUSE I'D REALLY LOVE TO GO THERE AND FEEL WHAT YOU FELT I SUPPOSE ANYWAYS HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT
AS A GUY WHO HAS DECIDED TO TRAVEL AS MUCH OF THE WORLD AS POSSIBLE I DON'T REALLY HAVE A BUCKET LIST OR EVEN A LIST OF WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IN THE PLACES I GO THE ONLY EXCEPTION BEING HOBBITON I HAVE TO SEE HOBBITON
I WAS CONFUSED WHEN I OPENED THIS AND IT WASN'T FROM GTA VERB
YOU LOOK A LOT LIKE DAN RICKERT
CAN'T SEE A SCRATCH ON THE DOOR FROM GANDALF I'LL GIVE YOU A
JEALOUSY LEVEL HIGH
DO YOU KNOW SEAN
IT'S AN AWESOME TOUR HEY OUR GUIDE HAD WORKED ON SET AND HAD HEAPS OF INTERESTING STORIES THE QUALITY OF THE PLACE IS AMAZING
I ENVY YOU OP GETTING TO GO TO THE SHIRE AND LOOKING LIKE CONOR MCGREGOR
I'M SO JEALOUS
I WORKED THERE FOR FIVE MONTHS AS A GUIDE BEST EXPERIENCE EVER
CONGRATULATIONS SIR I HOPE IT WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AND INNOCENT AS I THINK IT IS WHATS IT SMELL LIKE PLEASE SAY DOO AND CHRISTMAS
IS THAT DAN RICKERT
I JUST WANT TO LIVE IN THAT FUCKING HOUSE IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK IS IT WORLD IS THAT TOO FUCKING MUCH
AND YOU WENT THERE AND BACK AGAIN STAYED RIGHT
THAT IS A BLOODY BEAUTIFUL BEARD
I'M SO GLAD SOMEONE GOT TO GO WHENEVER I COME ACROSS SOMETHING
BUCOLIC IN MY WORLD I ALWAYS THINK AH JUST LIKE THE SHIRE
SO AWESOME THANKS FOR SHARING
YOU LUCKY LUCKY BASTARD
I WENT TO THE SHIRE TOO I MUST SAY IT IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES THAT IS ACTUALLY MORE BEAUTIFUL IN PERSON THAN IT IS IN THE MOVIES
WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR GLASSES FROM I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ALONG THESE LINES BUT EVERYTHING I'VE FOUND HAS THICK RIMS
LOL THIS PICTURE IS PERFECT IT LOOKS LIKE A SELFIE FROM GRAND THEFT AUTO
PRETTY COOL PUMPKIN
WAS IT WORTH IT
I'VE BEEN THERE IT WAS AMAZING A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING INSIDE THE HOUSES THOUGH OVERALL SUPER COOL EXPERIENCE
DAMN LOOKS A LOT BETTER THAN WHEN I SAW IT
OH MAN MY LIFE WOULD FOREVER BE COMPLETE IF I VISITED THERE CONGRATULATIONS FRIEND
THE EXACT SAME PICTURE WAS SENT TO ME BY
MY DAD IN THAT SAME SELFIE SPOT YEARS AGO HE IS SUCH A FAN AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW HIM THIS
ARE THERE STILL STREAMERS IN THE PARTY TREE THEY WERE THERE WHEN I VISITED IN
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IN THE MOVIES
I'M SO ENVIOUS AND FRUSTRATED BY SAID ENVY THAT I WANTED TO CRY I HOPE YOU HAD A WONDERFUL MAGICAL TIME

I LIKE YOUR JACKET
WAY TO GO YOUNG LETTERMAN
MY COUSIN WORKED FOR THE HOBBITON TOURS AND WOULD ROUTINELY HOTBOX THE INSIDE OF BAG END
REMOVED
IT'S TOO BAD YOU'RE NOT EXCITED ABOUT IT
REMOVED
I TOO AM REREADING FOR RIGHT NOW
RIGHT ON MINE IN THE PHOTO STARTS OFF AS BLACK AND WHEN IT GETS HOT FROM THE LIQUID IT GOES WHITE AND REVEALS THE SCRIPTURE IT'S QUITE FANTASTIC TO WATCH EVERY MORNING HAHA
I'VE ALSO GOT A COOL LOAR MUG I'LL POST IT ANOTHER DAY
THE PALANTIRI ARE QUITE DIFFERENT THOUGH AND EACH IS A BIT DIFFERENT BUT THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEN AND FACETIAE IS YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A RECEIVER ON THE OTHER END
IM JUST IMAGINING DENETHOR GOING UP TO THE STONE AFTER THE FALL OF OSGILIATH TRYING TO CUT HIS LOSSES OR WHATEVER AND ALL HE FINDS IS A MESSAGE FROM SARON

GG EZ
A SEEING STONE COULD LOOK INTO A ROOM IF IT WAS NOT DARK GET YOUR PEEPING TOM ON WAS LIKE POWERFUL BINOCULARS BUT THEY WERE ALSO DRAINING ON THE USERS USE OF IT GAVE HIM THE APPEARANCE OF PREMATURE OLD AGE FIRST OBSERVABLE WHEN HE WAS NOT MUCH ABOVE SIXTY YEARS OLD ALTHOUGH HE BELONGED TO A RACE AND FAMILY THAT STILL NORMALLY HAD LONGER LIVES THAN OTHER MEN THE PALANTÍRI WHEN ARAGON FIRST USED IT HE LOOKED WASTED SO STARTLING WAS THE CHANGE THAT HE SAW IN HIM AS IF IN ONE NIGHT MANY YEARS HAD FALLEN ON HIS HEAD THE PASSING OF THE GREY COMPANY
PROBABLY GIVING FACETIAE TOO MUCH CREDIT THE PALANTIRI ARE IMPLIED TO BE CAPABLE OF OR AT LEAST TO FACILITATE LOOKING ACROSS TIME AND INTO THE MINDS OF OTHERS AS WELL AS LOOKING AT PLACES WITH NO OTHER DEVICE CONNECTING
I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE A ROUND CELLPHONE WOULD BE PRETTY KILLER
I WOULD SAY THE PALANTIRI ARE FACETIAE IF FACETIAE REQUIRED EXTREME MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL TOUGHNESS AND STAMINA JUST TO BRIEFLY OPERATE
BOOMIER I FEEL HE ALONG WITH THRODDEN BEST EMBODIES WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A MAN AS IN OF THE RACE OF MEN IN WORLD

BOOMIER IS BRAVE STRONG HONORABLE AND LOYAL HE IS ALSO CAPABLE OF GREAT COMPASSION BOOMIER WOULD GIVE HIS LIFE TO SAVE THE PEOPLE HE CARES ABOUT OR EVEN ANYONE FOR WHOM HE FEELS RESPONSIBLE

STILL ON THE OTHER HAND BOOMIER IS PROUD IMPATIENT AND A BIT OF A DICK HE DOES NOT SEEK POWER FOR ITS OWN SAKE BUT HE DOES ENJOY THE GLORY THAT BEING A POWERFUL WARRIOR BRINGS IN A WAY BOOMIER IS A MAN WITH A HAMMER WHO VIEWS EVERY PROBLEM AS A NAIL THAT WAY OF THINKING IS WHAT LEAVES HIM SUSCEPTIBLE TO TEMPTATION BUT HIS NOBLE QUALITIES WIN OUT IN THE END
COMER

HE IS SUCH A DAMN COOL CHARACTER HE IS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST MEN TO BECOME MARSHALL AND HE HAS THE FORESIGHT AND WISDOM TO HELP ARAGON AND GIMLI AND PERGOLAS WHEN HE MEETS THEM IN HIS LAND DURING THE BATTLE OF PELENNOR FIELDS HE LEARNS THAT HIS UNCLE WAS KILLED AND THINKS HIS SISTER IS TOO AND GOES ON A BERSERK RAMPAGE WITH HIS HOST OF RIDERS LITERALLY SCREAMING DEATH WHILE RIDING OVER THE RANKS OF ORCS

AND AFTER THE BATTLE ENDS HE TAKES UP ROLE AND KING COMER AND GOES ON TO BECOME GREAT FRIENDS WITH ARAGON WHO REFERS TO HIM AS A BROTHER HE CONTINUES TO FIGHT BESIDE KING ELESSAR THROUGH HIS REIGN AS KING OF ROHAN AND WAS GIVEN THE SURNAME BLESSED BECAUSE OF THE PEACE AND PROSPERITY HE SAW DURING HIS REIGN AS KING FOR YEARS

LASTLY HE WAS ONLY IN HIS MID WHEN HE ACCOMPLISHED ALL THIS YOUNGER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS

EDIT ALSO I REALLY LOVED KARL PORTRAYAL OF HIM IN THE FILMS
MY FAVORITE CHARACTER FROM LORD OF THE RINGS IS ARAGON AND HAS BEEN SINCE I READ THE BOOKS AS A KID HE EMBODIES EVERYTHING I THINK LEADERSHIP SHOULD BE ABOUT STRENGTH COMPASSION LOYALTY AND KNOWLEDGE MOVIE ARAGON DOES PRETTY GOOD WITH THESE TRAITS BUT WITH A MUCH LARGER DOSE OF UNCERTAINTY AND SELF-DOUBT WHICH MAKES HIM A BIT MORE REBATEABLE ALL BRILLIANTLY PLAYED BY VIGO MORTENSEN

CLOSE SECOND WOULD BE ELWYN AND FAVORITE CHARACTER FROM THE WHOLE TZOLKIN CANON WOULD BE IDRIA
GANDALF BECAUSE HE'S ONE OF THE CLEVERER CHARACTERS IN THE BOOKS AND BECAUSE I LOVE HIS SENSE OF HUMOR AND HOW NARKY AND CRANKY HE CAN BE BUT ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SOMETHING APPEALING TO ME ABOUT THE IDEA OF THIS ANGELIC BEING WHO EXISTED BEFORE TIME BEGAN AND LITERALLY HELPED SING THE UNIVERSE INTO EXISTENCE TAKING ON HUMAN FORM AND PALLING AROUND WITH A BUNCH OF HOBBITS WITHOUT EVER REVEALING HIS TRUE NATURE
TREEBEARD HIS WISDOM AND AGE COMBINED WITH HIS MORAL PURITY HE'S LIKE PATIENCE PERSONIFIED HE IS STRONG AND A LEADER BUT IS STILL A TREE HERDER
I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO SAY PALMWISE GAMGEE HE IS EXTREMELY LOYAL AND COMMITTED TO THE TASK OF LOOKING OUT FOR FRODO AS THEY MAKE THEIR JOURNEY THERE'S TWO SPECIFIC TIMES HE WON ME OVER

END OF THE FELLOWSHIP WHEN HE GOES AFTER FRODO EVEN THOUGH HE CAN'T SWIM DON'T YOU LEAVE HIM PALMWISE GAMGEE AND I DON'T MEAN TO

2 HIS SPEECH TO FRODO IN THE TWO TOWERS THERE'S SOME GOOD IN THIS WORLD MR FRODO AND IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR

AND IT WAS CONFIRMED WHEN SAM CARRIES FRODO UP MOUNT DOOM HE'S A GENUINE FRIEND AND AN EVEN MORE GENUINE PERSON HOBBIT
BILL THE PONY BECAUSE HE'S AWESOME HE'S SO COOL HE EVEN RECEIVES THE BLESSING OF A MAIA OF MANAWA AND ARDA GANDALF THE GREY AT THE DIMRILL GATE
FELAGUND IS MY FAVORITE HE'S JUST A COOL GUY
WITHOUT QUESTION GALADRIEL I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH HER FROM THE FIRST TIME I SAW HER WAY BACK AT AGE I'M NOW BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT NEVER WAS A SEX THING BUT MORE TO DO I THINK WITH HER GOODNESS AND HER TREMENDOUS POWER IN ADDITION TO HER GREAT BEAUTY BUT THAT'S THE THING ABOUT HER SHE'S BEAUTIFUL IN JUST ABOUT EVERY WAY A BEING CAN BE AND I CAN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE THAT
GIMLI SON OF ALOIN I LOVE HIS HUMOUR IN THE MOVIES AND IN THE BOOKS I WAS HAPPY TO READ HOW HE AND PERGOLAS FRIENDSHIP GREW IN THE BOOK YOU CAN REALLY SENSE THE GREAT FRIENDSHIP THEY HAD EVEN MORE THAN IN THE MOVIE THAT WAS A REAL ROMANCE
FROM LOAR ONLY MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS ARE DEFINITELY THRODDEN AND GANDALF THE FIRST BECAUSE OF HIS HONOR AND FURY COMBINES AND THE LATTER BECAUSE OF THE WISDOM CLEVERNESS AND KINDNESS

COMING IN CLOSE ARE ELROD TREEBEARD AND PIPPIN OF ALL CHARACTERS

FROM THE WIDER WORLD I LIKE FIBROID AND FINGOLFIN A LOT AND LÚTHIEN WITH HER BADASSERY

MY FAVORITE NAME OF ALL IS ELROD

BUT ABOVE ANY OTHER CHARACTERS I HOLD CHURDAN IN THE HIGHEST ESTEEM BECAUSE HE IS AN ELF WITH AN AWESOME BEARD
FARAMIR I LOVE HOW HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY GOOD AT WHAT HE DOES FIGHTING LEADING MEN YET HE CLEARLY DOES NOT ENJOY IT HE'S THE SORT OF GUY THAT TRULY FIGHTS BECAUSE HE MUST
ALSO BEAUTIFUL UGLÚK WITH HIS CORNEOUS WAY OF SPEAKING TO PEOPLE
QUICKBEAM I LIKE THAT HIS TEMPERAMENT IS AT ODDS WITH THE OTHER ANTS HIS PASSION FOR HIS TREE HERD AND HIS FELLOW ANTS IS SO RELATABLE AND HE ALSO SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE MORE BADASS WARRIORS OF THE ANTS PLUS HIS NAME IS COOL
DENETHOR THE POLITICIAN
OLD BIRLIEMAN BUTTERBUR FOR HIS CONSTANT RAMBLINGS
I LIKE GANDALF BECAUSE HE'S WISE KNOWS MUCH MORE THAN HE EVER TELLS WANTS NOTHING BUT GOOD FOR EVERYONE AND STILL ENJOYS LITTLE THINGS LIKE PILEWEED I'VE ALWAYS LOVED WIZARDS BUT GANDALF MIGHT BE THE REASON I LIKE THEM SO MUCH
ELWYN SHE ACCOMPLISHES AS MUCH AS MANY OF THE NAMED MALE CHARACTERS AND BECAUSE OF HER BROTHER AND UNCLE AND COUSIN HAS SURVIVED JUST AS MUCH
THEOWMEN ALL SORTS OF BADASS IN BOTH NOVEL AND FILM
REALLY IT'S A TIE BETWEEN CELEBRIMBOR AND SARON

I LOVE THE FACT HE CREATED THE RINGS FOR THE ELVES WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE AND TO ME THAT MAKES HIM A HERO

SARON ON THE OTHER HAND I LOVE HIS STORY AND I ALSO ENJOY ROOTING FOR THE BAD GUY FROM TIME TO TIME
I HAVE TO SAY FARAMIR AND GIMLI HUMOR AND CONFIDENCE MAKE HIM SO LOVABLE AS FOR FARAMIR HE'S SUCH A GREAT GUY AND I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THE WAY DENETHOR TREATS HIM I'M ALSO SUPER HAPPY WHEN HIM AND BOWEN GET TOGETHER AFTER ARAGON HILARIOUSLY REJECTS HER WITH HIS IT IS BUT A SHADOW AND A THOUGHT THAT YOU LOVE
THE GRAND SCALE OF PELENNOR FIELDS MAKES IT EPIC BUT THE WAY THEY DID HELMS DEEP JUST MAKES IT FEEL SO REAL AND CHAOTIC IT HAD A REAL SENSE OF BATTLE AND SUFFERING AND REALITY

I ALSO DON'T LIKE THE WAY THEY TOOK AWAY THE VICTORY FROM ROHAN AT PELENNOR AND GAVE IT THE ARMY OF THE DEAD
I'D SAY PELENNOR FIELDS IF ONLY JUST FOR EPIC SPEECH WHICH GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS EVERY TIME
BATTLE OF DEEP THE DYNAMIC OF THE BATTLE IS PRETTY COOL AND I LOVE THE SCENE OF GANDALF COMING IN FROM THE MOUNTAIN
PELENNOR UP UNTILL WHEN THE GHOST ARMY ARRIVES
MOVIES HELMS DEEP LOAR BOOKS PELENNOR FIELDS
CAN I PUT A VOTE IN FOR A THIRD OPTION AND PICK THE BATTLE ON THE SLOPES OF ORODRUIN IN THE PROLOGUE IT HAS A GREAT MYTHIC QUALITY TO IT IT LOOKS BRILLIANT AND WAS REALLY NOT SOMETHING I EXPECTED TO SEE IN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES OF THE FILM THE BATTLES AND WARS OF ANCIENT MIDDLE EARTH HAVE ALWAYS INTERESTED GREATLY AND IT WAS REALLY COOL TO SEE ONE DONE IN LIVE ACTION EVEN THOUGH IT WAS GREATLY CONDENSED FROM THE LORE
HORNBURG WOULD HAVE TO BE MY FAVOURITE BATTLE IN THE TRILOGY

EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT BATTLE WAS BRILLIANT THE TACTICS THE USED THE BOND BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF THE FELLOWSHIP THE HEROISM DISPLAYED BY THE DEFENDERS THE WAY GANDALF AND COMER RODE IN AT THE END OF THE BATTLE EVEN THE STRUGGLES THAT WERE FACED BY THEOWMEN AND HIS MEN WERE BEAUTIFULLY PORTRAYED SURE THE HEROES HAD SOME PLOT ARMOUR GOING FOR THEM BUT OVERALL THERE IS ENOUGH DEATH ON BOTH SIDES TO KEEP THE BATTLE REALISTIC
THE LAST MARCH OF THE ANTS

DON'T THINK I NEED TO ELABORATE FURTHER
PELENNOR FIELDS DESPITE THE SIEGE OF MINAS TIGRISH BEING UNDERWHELMING THE RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM IS POSSIBLY MY FAVORITE SCENE IN ANY OF THE MOVIES AND THE FIRST SCENE OF THE MUMAKIL IS BADASS AS HELL

DEEP WAS PROBABLY BETTER THOUGH IT WAS MUCH MORE PERSONAL AND HAD A LOT OF VARIETY I'VE NEVER LIKED THE CHARGE THOUGH I THINK IT JUST BARELY CROSSED THE LINE FROM EPIC TO CHEESY
I THINK THE BATTLE AT HELMS DEEP WAS THE BEST VERY DETAILED EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SCENE IS DOOM AND GLOOM AND IT PLAYS ON THE SAME GLOOM IN EVERY ONE OF WARRIORS WAITING FOR WHAT WAS LIKELY THEIR DEATH

GREAT BUILDUP TENSION UNTIL THE BATTLE ACTUALLY STARTS
THE BATTLE IN THE MINES OF MORIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE IT'S THE FIRST REAL FIGHT AND ONLY FIGHT YOU SEE WHEN THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP IS TOGETHER THEY SHOWCASE EACH PERSON'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIGHT FROM FRYING PANS TO ORC DECAPITATION IT'S ONE OF THE FEW SCENES IN THE MOVIE NOT UNDERSCORED BY MUSIC SO EACH ACTION SEEMS EXCEPTIONALLY STACCATO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BUILD UP TO IT BASICALLY STARTING BACK AT MOUNT CARACARAS SP DEEP AND PELENNOR ARE BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR OWN RIGHTS BUT I THINK MORIA IS SO MUCH SMALLER IN SCALE THAT THE INTENSITY OF EACH ACTION MATTERS SO MUCH MORE THE MINES ARE STEEPED WITH HISTORY THAT WE ONLY GET A SMALL GLIMPSE OF IN THE MOVIE WITH DEATH AND ALLUSION TO THE BARONG IT ALWAYS MADE ME WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY BEYOND JUST DELVING TOO DEEP
HORNBURG IT FEELS MUCH MORE RESPECTFUL OF DESIRE TO MAKE HIS BATTLES REFLECT THE HARSH HORRIBLE REALITY OF HIS EXPERIENCES IN WWI
TOMB SURE IT'S JUST THE FELLOWSHIP AGAINST A WHOLE BUNCH OF GOBLINS BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY MEMORABLE
HELMS DEEP

BOOKS PELANNOR FIELDS THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE BATTLE ARE FANTASTIC READ THE PASSAGE WHERE COMER SEES THE BLACK SHIPS AND THEN THE FLAG OF ELENDIL IS UNFURLED ON THE LEAD SHIP ELWYN AND MERRY VS THE WITCH KING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE LEADER OF THE HARADRIM THEODENS DEATH
WHICH FAIR THAT'S AWESOME HAHA I'LL BE GOING TO THE ONE IN TUXEDO NY THIS SUNDAY LAST YEAR I TRIED TO TRY ON THE SARON HELM THEY HAVE AND INSTANTLY GOT REPRIMANDED
WOW TALK ABOUT COPLAY GOALS
I KNOW NOW WHAT I WANT TO BE FOR HALLOWEEN
LOL GANDALF JUMPING OFF AN EAGLE WILDCARD BITCHES YEEEEEEEHAW
TZOLKIN RECEIVED A MUG WITH THIS POEM WRITTEN ON IT AS A GIFT FROM A FAN HE NEVER DRANK FROM IT BECAUSE IT WAS INSCRIBED WITH THE EVIL BLACK SPEECH
WHERE DO YOU GET IT WE WANTS IT
I THINK IT'S A SECOND PRINT OF THE FIRST EDITION MOST BOOK CLUB EDITIONS OF BOOKS ARE SECOND PRINTING
I PICKED ONE UP OVER THE SUMMER FOR A SIMILAR PRICE AS WELL WAS REALLY EXCITED THEY'RE NOT WORTH A GREAT DEAL DUE TO BEING PUBLISHED AFTER LOAR THE HOBBIT I'M REALLY HAPPY TO OWN ONE NONETHELESS
DOES A BOOK CLUB EDITION REALLY COUNT AS A FIRST EDITION
HI YOUR POST MADE ME COME OUT OF MY LONG LURK
MY GRANDAD OWNED THE PRINTING SHOP THAT PRINTED THESE DESIGNS I THINK THEY'RE TOLKIENS ORIGINAL DRAWINGS NOT SURE THOUGH
I HAVE ALL THE TRILOGY AND SIL AND HOBBIT OF THIS EDITION AT HOME AS WELL AS SOME OTHER THINGS LIKE CALENDARS AND TOLKIENS DOODLE SCANS
IF INTERESTED I CAN POST SOME PICTURES
NICE FIND BUT PLATINUM IS A BIT OVER PRICED FOR A BOOK
I HAVE THE SAME FOR SIMILAR PRICE ALTHOUGH IF IT'S LIKE MINE IT'S ACTUALLY A FIRST EDITION SECOND PRINT SOME CORRECTIONS WERE MADE AFTER THE FIRST PRINT IT SHOULD SAY ON THE INSIDE
A LITTLE BACKGROUND

THAT IS A BOOK CLUB EDITION LIKE BOOK OF THE MONTH CLUB OR LITERARY GUILD BUY BOOKS FOR AND YOU ONLY HAVE TO BUY FOUR MORE AT REGULAR PRICE DURING THE NEXT YEAR

BOOK CLUB EDITIONS HAD HAVE DIFFERENT CHEAPER PRINT RUNS THAN EDITIONS THEY WERE NOT SOLD AT RETAIL

SOURCE I BELONGED TO A COUPLE OF BOOK CLIMBS IN THE
BOOK CLUB EDITIONS ARE NOT USUALLY 1ST EDITIONS SORRY TO SAY BUT THIS IS UNLIKELY TO BE WORTH MUCH THEY ARE SEPARATELY PRINTED NOT BY THE ORIGINAL PUBLISHER OFTEN LOWER QUALITY AND ARE GENERALLY SHUNNED BY BOOK COLLECTORS
I FOUND THE SAME ONE FIRST EDITION AT A LOCAL USED BOOKSTORE THOUGH NOT IN AS GOOD CONDITION GREAT FIND
NICE LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S THE FIRST ENGLISH EDITION I HAVE THE FIRST AMERICAN EDITION THAT HAS A DIFFERENT COVER I GOT IT FOR ON EBAY
WOW AWESOME YOU SHOULD CROSSPOST THIS OVER AT R FANTASY LOT OF LOAR FANS OVER THERE
LOOKS LIKE MINE USED TO I LOST THE DUST COVER THOUGH
NICE FIND LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE MY OWN FIRST EDITION COPY
GOT THE VERY SAME VERSION AT A GARAGE SALE A FEW YEARS BACK ONE CANADIAN DOLLAR
IS A GREAT PRICE AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN GOOD SHAPE
MY PARENTS HAD AN EDITION IDENTICAL TO THAT ONE WHEN I GREW UP BUT IT WAS A SPECIALLY PRINTED EDITION FROM A BOOK CLUB NOT THE ACTUAL FIRST RUN FROM THE PUBLISHER
I JUST SQUEALED
I FOUND A ABOUT A YEAR AGO GAVE IT TO MY BROTHER FOR CHRISTMAS

DIDN'T COME WITH A SLEEVE BUT I LOVE THE HARDCOVER
NICE I INHERITED THE SAME EDITION FROM MY GRANDFATHER
IT IS NOT A FIRST EDITION PRINT WORTH UP TO SEE HERE
I HAD THIS COPY NOW TO FIND IT LOL
DAMN THATS COOL
DO YOU MEAN THE FILMS

IF SO I POSTED IN ANOTHER THREAD NOT TOO LONG AGO THAT I LIKED TO SEE SONS AND THE GREY COMPANY JOIN ARAGON TAKE THE SHIPS IN SOUTHERN CONDOR AND SAIL UP TO THE PELENNOR I DON'T GET WHY THEY CHANGED THIS BIT SO MUCH IN THE FILM
DIDN'T REALLY LIKE HOW THE FILM HEAVILY IMPLIED THE ARMY OF THE DEAD AS BEING THE ONLY HOPE OF DEFENDING MINAS TIGRISH BUT I GUESS IT MADE SENSE DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS
I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE HOW THEY DUMBED DOWN ALL THE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS TO MAKE THE MAIN CHARACTERS LOOK BETTER THEOWMEN ACTING ARROGANT AND NOT LISTENING TO ADVICE TREEBEARD BEING CLUELESS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN HIS OWN BORDERS AND HAVING TO BE TRICKED BY MERRY AND PIPPIN FARAMIR BEING SWAYED BY THE RING ETC

I ALSO WOULD HAVE PREFERRED COMIC RELIEF GIMLI AND EXPOSITION UNREALISTICALLY BADASS PERGOLAS TO HAVE MORE CHARACTER

THE BIGGEST CHANGE I DID NOT LIKE HOWEVER WAS MAKING BOOMIER AN ARROGANT JERK IN THE BOOKS HE WAS A PROUD AND NOBLE MAN THAT KNEW HIS PEOPLE WOULD EVENTUALLY FALL AGAINST MORDOR HE WAS DESPERATE ACCEPTING SWORD AND HELP FROM THE BEGINNING UNLIKE THE FILMS LOOKING FOR SOME HOPE TO TURN THE TIDE WHICH LED HIM TO BEING SEDUCED BY THE RING I FELT THAT DESPERATION MAKES HIS DOWNFALL ALL THE MORE TRAGIC

IN THE FILMS HE IS JUST AN ANGRY ARROGANT JERK WHO WANTS POWER TO BEAT MORDOR THE VIEWERS ARE NOT SURPRISED BY HIM BEING CORRUPTED AS UNLIKE THE GOOD GUYS WHO CAN RESIST THE RING HE IS A JERK
THE ARAGON FAKE DEATH IN THE TWO TOWERS SEEMS REALLY WEIRD ALSO I DON'T THINK JOURNEY IN THE FINAL TWO FILMS IS VERY GOOD THEY REALLY CHANGED HIS ARC FROM THE BOOKS TO THE FILMS
PROBABLY THE PART WHERE PERGOLAS DOES A SWEET BOARD SLIDE DOWN A STAIR ON A SHIELD WHILE FIRING A BUNCH OF ARROWS
IN THE EXTENDED EDITION ARAGON CUTTING OFF THE HEAD OF THE MOUTH OF SARON IS SO OUT OF CHARACTER AND SO BARBARIC I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA THIS IMO IS THE SINGLE WORST CHANGE OF THE ENTIRE FILMS
DIDN'T LOVE TREATMENT MY FAVORITE MOMENT IN HELMS DEEP IS WHEN HE AND ARAGON GO TO BATTLE TOGETHER BUT SINCE THEY COMBINED HIM WITH SOMEONE ELSE HE'S A NO SHOW TIL LATER
I THINK SOMEONE ALREADY MAY HAVE MENTIONED IT BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY CUT THE EE SCENE OF BOOMIER AND FARAMIR TOGETHER AT OSGILIATH WITH DENETHOR FIRST OF ALL SEEING BOOMIER IN HIS ELEMENT AS CAPTAIN OF CONDOR WAS AWESOME SECONDLY SEEING HIM ON SCREEN WITH FARAMIR WAS AWESOME AND WOULD HAVE REALLYYY STRENGTHENED THE BOOMIER DRAMA IN THE FELLOWSHIP AND IN THE RETURN OF THE KIND WHEN DENETHOR TELLS FARAMIR THAT HE FAVORED BOOMIER THAT EE SCENE WAS JUST AWESOME
I DIDN'T LIKE HOW PIPPIN WAS PORTRAYED AS A TOTAL IDIOT IN THE MOVIES WHEN HE WAS NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL IN THE BOOK

I REALLY THOUGHT THAT FIRST SCENE WHERE FRODO WAKES UP AND IS IN RIVENDELL RIGHT AFTER DESTROYING THE RING AND THEN EVERYONE SHOWS UP AND THEY START LAUGHING LIKE THEY ARE HIGH OFF OF WHO KNOWS WHAT DRUGS YEA I THOUGHT THAT WAS BEYOND STUPID
ARWEN SAVING FRODO ON THE BRIDGE WHEN I WAS SOOOOOO HYPED IN BEING AN ALMIGHTY ELF WARLORD TAKING THE NINE BY HIMSELF

I MEAN READ THAT PART IN THE BOOK AGAIN IT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE BEST WRITTEN PART ABOUT THE TRUE POWER OF THE ELF WARRIOR THE MAGNIFICENCE AND THE POWER OF LIGHT AND ALL THAT STUFF
PERGOLAS KILLING THE MUZAK WAS A BIT SILLY I ALSO WASN'T A FAN OF HOW COLWYN PINES FOR ARAGON SO MUCH SHE WAS A BETTER CHARACTER IN THE BOOK
ALL OF THE CHOPPY IT'S ESPECIALLY BAD LOOKING THROUGH LENSES BUT EVEN AT THE TIME IT LOOKED TERRIBLE THE SCENE WITH PIPPIN HAS AN EXAMPLE CIRC
WHEN PIPPIN KNOCKS OVER THE HELMET INTO THE WELL

CIMON DUDE WE WERE ALMOST THROUGH
NO TOM BOBADIL
WHEN THE PRANCING PONY IS DEPICTED AS DIRTY UNTIDY AND HOSTILE PLACE IN THE BOOKS

EVEN FROM THE OUTSIDE THE INN LOOKED A PLEASANT HOUSE TO FAMILIAR EYES AS THEY HESITATED OUTSIDE IN THE GLOOM SOMEONE BEGAN SINGING A MERRY SONG INSIDE AND MANY CHEERFUL VOICES JOINED LOUDLY IN THE CHORUS THEY LISTENED TO THIS ENCOURAGING SOUND FOR A MOMENT AND THEN GOT OFF THEIR PONIES THE SONG ENDED AND THERE WAS A BURST OF LAUGHTER AND CLAPPING

AND WHEN PIPPIN AND MERRY ARE TURNED INTO COMEDIC RELIEFS FRODO IS A SOBBING WHO JUST DRIFTS AROUND ITHILIEN WITHOUT OBJECTIVE SAM IS TURNED INTO A VIOLENT ASSHOLE ARAGON BECOMES EMOGORN WHO WHEN COLWYN IS CLEARLY INFATUATED IN HIM JUST THROWS MORE FUEL TO THE FLAMES INSTEAD OF TAKING DISTANCE LIKE THE ACTUAL CHARACTER WHEN GIMLI IS TURNED INTO A COMEDIC RELIEF FARAMIR IS CHANGED INTO AN ON THE OTHER HAND AND INTO A ON THE OTHER WHEN DENETHOR IS MADE INTO A DROOLING LUNATIC THE LIST GOES ON AND ON
SOME OF THE HUMOR WAS PRETTY OUT OF PLACE I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY MORE OF A PROBLEM IN THE EXTENDED EDITIONS BECAUSE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE WHY THEY WERE CUT
WHAT TRILOGY
I FOUND PRETTY MUCH ALL THE MOMENTS BETWEEN ARAGON AND ARWEN VERY AWKWARD I DID NOT THINK THAT VIGO MORTENSEN AND LIV TYLER HAD CHEMISTRY WITH EACH OTHER AT ALL AND I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WHENEVER THEY INTERACTED
THE BIAS IS SO REAL IN THIS POST ALMOST ANALOGOUS TO PHRASING A QUESTION WITH AN ANSWER WHO IS THE HOTTEST AND WHY IS IT ME THE FILMS ARE NOT CONSIDERED MASTERPIECES BY PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES FAMILIAR WITH TZOLKIN LORE DO SOME RESEARCH ON THIS SUBREDDIT AND YOU'LL FIND OUT THERE ARE MORE MISTAKES IN THE FILMS THAN YOU CAN PROBABLY POINT OUT THAN ACCURATE PORTRAYALS FROM THE BOOKS

WITH THAT BEING SAID IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT UNIVERSE I'M SURE THE FILMS WERE EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING AND ALL OF THE SCENES WERE ENJOYABLE FOR THE MOST PART
FROM THE OPENING SCENE WHERE SAURURAN IS SLAMMING GANDALF OFF WALLS YOU KNEW THAT THE FILMS WOULD BE ALL ABOUT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND NOTHING ABOUT LOAR
I DIDN'T LIKE THE HEAVY EMOTIONS HE FORCED ON FRODO AND IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL SAM PARTICULARLY COMES ACROSS AS A WHINEY BABY HOBBITS WERE TOUGH
GANDALF DOES EVENTUALLY FIND GOLLUM IN THE FILM AS WELL THAT'S HOW HE LEARNS THAT THE ENEMY GOT SHIRE AND BAGGIES
I ALWAYS THOUGHT GANDALF AND ARAGON KNEW EACH OTHER IN THE FILMS BOOMIER ASKS ARAGON WHO HE IS AND HE REPLIED A FRIEND OF GANDALF THE GREY THE ACTORS PORTRAYED IT LIKE THE CHARACTERS KNEW EACH OTHER TOO IMO NOT TOO CHUMMY KINDA DISTANT LIKE A I'VE PUT UP WITH YOUR SHIT BEFORE BUT WE'RE COOL KINDA VIBE
THAT IS THE THEME TO EYEWITNESS A TV SERIES FROM THE BBC
I THOUGHT ARAGON WAS VERY DIFFERENT IN THE MOVIE IN THE BOOK I REMEMBER HIM BEING VERY GUNG-HO ABOUT BEING KING I'M ACTUALLY GLAD THAT P CHANGED HIM TO BE MORE HUMBLE BECAUSE I THINK THAT IF HE DIDN'T AUDIENCES WOULD HAVE SEEN HIM AS HAUGHTY AND ENTITLED THE WAY TZOLKIN WROTE HIM THOUGH WAS VERY APROPOS FOR THE TIME THOUGH FICTIONAL LEADERS WERE PEOPLE WHO WANTED THAT ROLE AND IN MY OPINION WERE MORE RESPECTED BECAUSE OF THAT ERROL FLYNN IN THE MOVIE ROBIN HOOD COMES TO MIND
I THINK FARAMIR I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CHANGED HIS CHARACTER BUT IT IS THE ONE THING THAT BOTHERS ME STILL
DENETHOR IS A BIG ONE IN THE BOOKS HE IS A TRAGIC FIGURE A FLAWED BUT NOBLE MAN WHO FALLS BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT DESIRE TO PROTECT CONDOR HE CAN MATCH WITS WITH GANDALF MAKES SOUND DECISIONS REGARDING THE DEFENSE OF THE CITY AND WEARS CHAIN MAIL AND A SWORD UNDER HIS ROBE EVEN AFTER HIS FALL GANDALF SAYS DENETHOR WAS NOT ENTIRELY WRONG

IN THE MOVIE HE'S A INEFFECTUAL BUREAUCRAT WHO SLOWLY GROWS CRAZY WITH GRIEF WHO IS MORE OF A IMPEDIMENT THAN ANYTHING
ARWEN FOR SURE
GIMLI HIS ENTIRE EXISTENCE WAS REDUCED DOWN TO COMEDIC RELIEF AND HIS CHARACTER SUFFERED GREATLY FOR IT
TOM BOBADIL
THEOWMEN IS VERY DIFFERENT AS WELL HE'S A LOT MORE SOMBRE IN THE FILMS I UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS HARDER TO SELL THE SENSE OF IMPENDING DOOM IN THE FILMS SO THEY MADE THE CHARACTERS MORE GRIM BUT IN THE BOOKS GANDALF HAS TO CONVINCE THEOWMEN TO DEFEND DEEP RATHER THAN RIDE OUT AND FIGHT THE IN OPEN BATTLE IN THE MOVIES THEOWMEN SORT OF RUNS TO DEEP WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS AND SEEMS LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO KILL HIMSELF UNTIL ARAGON IMPLORES HIM TO SORTIE
DELETED
FOR ME IT'S FRODO IN THE BOOKS HE THINKS HE IS GOING ON AN ADVENTURE LIKE BILBO EVEN TO HIS DETRIMENT WITH DRAGGING HIS FEET ABOUT LEAVING BEFORE THE END OF SUMMER TO MIMIC BILBO BUT TURNS OUT HIS ADVENTURE IS FAR DARKER IN IT HE KIND OF LEARNS KINDNESS AND PATIENCE HE GOES FROM KILLING ORCS IN MORIA WITH A FEROCITY THAT EVEN ARAGON TAKES NOTE OF TO REFUSING TO FIGHT IN THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE AT ALL IN THE MOVIES HE LOSES THAT LINE OF THINKING THE FIRST FILM DOES A GOOD JOB OF PAINTING HIS DESPERATION AND HIS REALIZATION THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A HAPPY-GO-LUCKY TRIP BUT AFTER THAT HE DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE VERY MUCH HE'S MOPEY AND ESSENTIALLY HIS CHARACTER ARC IN THE TWO TOWERS IS ADMITTING TO SAM HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE RING IT'S ALSO WHY THEY CHANGED FARAMIR INTO AN ANTAGONIST IN THAT FILM IMO
TAURINE WAS VERY DIFFERENT IN THE MOVIES SHE'S A WOMAN WHO SHOWS UP IN THE HOBBIT BUT IN THE BOOKS SHE'S A MAN NAMED TOM BOBADIL WHO APPEARS IN LOAR
I FEEL LIKE MERRY AND PIPPIN WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE MOVIES THEY ARE MOSTLY USED FOR COMIC RELIEF WHILE IN THE BOOKS THEY ARE ACTUALLY VERY SMART THERE ARE SOME SCENES WHERE THEY DO SHOW THIS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THEY HELP FRODO ESCAPE THE BLACK RIDERS AT THE START OF FELLOWSHIP BUT MOSTLY THEY JUST SCREW THINGS UP IN THE MOVIES
EVERY GONDORIAN REALLY BOOMIER IS ABOUT HALF EVIL IN THE FILMS FARAMIR IS A BIT OF A WET NOODLE AND DENETHOR IS ACTUALLY EVIL
HONESTLY THERE WERE SO MANY CHANGES IN THE MOVIES THAT I DON'T CONSIDER THEM TO BE THE REAL LOAR AT ALL THE MOVIES ARE JUST INTERPRETATION OF THE BOOKS I REALLY ENJOY THE MOVIES WHEN I CAN REMEMBER THAT BUT I'LL NEVER TAKE THEM AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN FLUFF
MAKING BOOMIER AN ARROGANT JERK IN THE FILMS IN THE BOOKS HE WAS A PROUD AND NOBLE MAN THAT KNEW HIS PEOPLE WOULD EVENTUALLY FALL AGAINST MORDOR HE WAS DESPERATE ACCEPTING SWORD AND HELP FROM THE BEGINNING UNLIKE THE FILMS LOOKING FOR SOME HOPE TO TURN THE TIDE WHICH LED HIM TO BEING SEDUCED BY THE RING I FELT THAT DESPERATION MAKES HIS DOWNFALL ALL THE MORE TRAGIC

IN THE FILMS HE IS JUST AN ANGRY ARROGANT JERK WHO WANTS POWER TO BEAT MORDOR THE VIEWERS ARE NOT SURPRISED BY HIM BEING CORRUPTED AS UNLIKE THE GOOD GUYS WHO CAN RESIST THE RING HE IS A JERK
FARAMIR IS THE MOST CHANGED IMO IN THE BOOKS HE RESISTS THE ALLURE OF THE RING WHICH MAKES ABSOLUTELY ZERO SENSE IT'S ONLY MAJOR BLUNDER IN HIS WRITING IT COMES OUT OF LEFT FIELD AND UNDERMINES MUCH OF WHAT GOES BEFORE AND COMES AFTER IT THE MOVIES CHANGED HIM FOR THE BETTER NOW HE HAS TO REALLY WORK TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION SO THE RING RETAINS ITS POWER AND FARAMIR APPEARS BADASS BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
THUMBNAIL SUGGESTED BULLET SHELLS
I DON'T KNOW YOU BUT I'M PRETTY SURE I'D MARRY YOU
DETAILS AT
ARE YOU SINGLE
THOSE ARE SOME DAMN NICE NAILS
C3
GOTHMOG THE FORSAKEN
TEVILDO PRINCE OF CATS
IF HE DOESN'T SHUT UP FOR ONE SECOND YOU COULD CALL HIM TOM BOMBADILL
QUEEN BERÚTHIEL COULD BE A FUNNY OPTION SHE IS MENTIONED BY ARAGON IN THE BOOKS THIS PASSAGE IS FROM THE UNFINISHED TALES SHE HAD NINE BLACK CATS AND ONE WHITE HER SLAVES WITH WHOM SHE CONVERSED OR READ THEIR MEMORIES SETTING THEM TO DISCOVER ALL THE DARK SECRETS OF CONDOR SO THAT SHE KNEW THOSE THINGS THAT MEN WISH MOST TO KEEP HIDDEN SETTING THE WHITE CAT TO SPY UPON THE BLACK AND TORMENTING THEM NO MAN IN CONDOR DARED TOUCH THEM ALL WERE AFRAID OF THEM AND CURSED WHEN THEY SAW THEM PASS THAT IS THE ONLY CAT REFERENCE I CAN THINK OF IN TZOLKIN AS FOR THE PRONUNCIATION OF MELIOR I USE LIKE MEL GIBSON AND APPLE CORE
ANCALAGON THE BLACK FIRST AND MIGHTIEST OF THE
MY OWN LEAN DARK TALL GUY WHO CAN AVOID BEING SEEN WHEN HE WISHES IS CALLED STRIDER
EAL DARK ELF LORD FROM THE SILMARILLION
IT'S BLACK SO UNGOLIANT SEEMS APPROPRIATE
OIKEROI GUARDIAN OF TEVILDO LORD OF CATS
I THINK SARON IS VERY FITTING OR PERHAPS STRIDER
SHELDON

SARON EVEN CALLED HER HIS CAT THOUGH SHE OWNS HIM NOT
WE HAD A FEMALE CAT NAMED SHADOW ONCE IT'S NOT EXACTLY TZOLKIN BUT IT CAN PLAY INTO THE SHADOW OF MORDOR OR THE NOTHING
MY MANY YEARS PASSED MAINE COON KITTY WAS NAMED BEDEN IT WAS NOT JUST A TZOLKIN HOMAGE BUT ALSO A NOD TO ME WANTING TO NAME HIM BJORN SINCE HE WAS PERFECTLY SPHERICAL AS A KITTEN AND REMINDED ME OF A WOOLEY BEAR CATERPILLER

HIS SISTER WAS ELWYN NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE BUT IT SUITED HER BETTER THAN LITHUVIEN THEY WERE BOTH MAGNIFICENT SPECIMENS OF THE MAINE COON VARIETY

IF I HAD AN ALL BLACK CAT TO NAME TODAY AND I DIDN'T NAME HIM BATMAN LIKE MY CURRENT ALL BLACK CAT I WOULD TOTALLY GO WITH PALANTIR OR MORDOR NEITHER IS A PERSON BUT DUDE SO MUCH BLACKNESS
MELIOR
SHADOWFAX
TALION THE REASON I SAY THAT IS IM CURRENTLY PLAYING SHADOW OF MORDOR AND TALION IS THE MAIN PROTAGONIST ALONGSIDE CELEBRIMBOR A GREEN WRAITH SIDEKICK WHO IS THE DECEASED GREAT SMITH OF THE SECOND AGE THE ONE WHO FORGED THE RING THE STORY IS INTERESTING AND DARK AND AWESOME BUT TALION WOULD MAKE A COOL NAME FOR A CAT
HERE'S A LINK TO THE OTHER SIDE I WAS SO EXITED TO SHARE IT I FORGOT TO TAKE A PHOTO OF THE OTHER SIDE LOL


I LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS PUZZLE

WAIT A MINUTE WHERE EXACTLY DID YOU GET THIS PUZZLE
WELL DONE THAT LOOKS FANTASTIC HAVE YOU CONSIDERED FRAMING THE PUZZLE
WHY DOES IT HAVE A SEEMINGLY EXTRANEOUS STRIP OF PIECES DOWN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE SEEMS AN ODD DESIGN CHOICE MAYBE THEY COULDN'T STRETCH IT TO FIT THE WHOLE PUZZLE SEEING AS THERE'S A DESIGN ON THE BACK
I WANT ONE YOU HAVE DONE THE HUMAN RACE A GREAT SERVICE BY SAVING THAT PUZZLE FROM THE THRIFT STORE
AWESOME I NEVER FIND STUFF LIKE THIS IN THE CHARITY SHOPS

THAT IS SUCH AN AWESOME FIND NICE WORK
THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO TRICK YOUR KIDS INTO LOVING TZOLKIN START AS EARLY AS PUZZLE AGE LOL
WOW THANKS FOR ALL THE SUPPORT I DIDN T THINK THIS POST WOULD GET SO MUCH ATTENTION SO SINCE EVERYONE LOVES IT I M GOING TO SHARE WHAT I HAVE PLANNED FOR THE FRAME SINCE ITS DOUBLE SIDED I PLAN FOR ONE SIDE OF THE FRAME TO HAVE THE ONE RING INSCRIPTION FOR THE SIDE WITH THE HOBBITS DRIFTING DOWN THE RIVER AND THE OTHER SIDE WITH THE MAP TO PUT THE MOON RUNES OFF MAP I THINK IT WOULD FIT THE PUZZLE VERY NICELY NOW ALL I NEED TO DO IS FIND A FRAME STORE WHO DOES DOUBLE SIDED FRAMES WITH DOUBLE SIDED GLASS
THATS A COOL FIND I CAN JUST IMAGINE THE SMILE INSIDE YOU WHEN YOU CAME ACROSS IT
I HAVE ONE OF THOSE AS WELL INTERESTED IN SEEING IF ALL THE PIECES ARE THERE I'VE GOT A MONTH OLD SO TIME TO SIT DOWN AND DO A PUZZLE WITHOUT RISK OF DAMAGING IT ROUGH TO FIND SOMETIMES
A PUZZLE FROM A THRIFT STORE THATS BRAVE
SAVED
COOL IT'S A BIT FAST BUT SOUNDS EXCELLENT NONETHELESS
THE NOTES ARE PERFECTLY DONE UNFORTUNATELY PATCHES JUST DON'T MATCH THE REAL THING IT'S A GREAT ARRANGEMENT THOUGH
IN THE SILMARILLION EÖNWË IS SAID TO BE GREATEST IN ARMS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE HE JUST WHOOPS MELIOR ON HIS OWN WHILE EVERYONE ELSE JUST HANGS AROUND
NOT SURE IF ANYONE IS STILL READING THIS BUT I'M TIPSY AGAIN AND I READ EVERY COMMENT

I FEEL LIKE MY ORIGINAL PREMISE WAS UNFAIR IN GOT ALL THAT MATTERS IS PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND TALENT AND PRACTICE IN LOAR IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE MANY MORE FACTORS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN TERMS OF THE TRAITS OF THOSE WHO FIGHT

THANK YOU ALL FOR THE INTERESTING READ AND PLEASE DO EXCUSE MY POOR ABILITY AT EXPRESSING MYSELF X
ARAGON COMER AND IMRAHIL ARE ALL UP THERE TOWARD THE END OF THE BATTLE OF PELENNOR FIELDS THERE'S A LINE WHERE THEY MEET UP ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND TZOLKIN SAYS THEY WERE SO MIGHTY THAT THEY ALL CAME OUT OF THE BATTLE UNSCATHED I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT SEEMED PRETTY DEFINITIVE
GLORFINDEL USED TO KILL BARONGS WHEN THEY FINALLY KILLED HIM HE JUST CAME BACK LATER

ARAGON IS UP THERE GANDALF IS ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST BEINGS ON THE PLANET SARON IS LIKE GANDALF ONLY STRONGER
IF WE'RE TALKING JUST BETWEEN THE FELLOWSHIP AND NOT COUNTING GANDALF BECAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE ANSWER I'D SAY BOOMIER THERE'S ONE PART IN THE BOOK I THINK WHILE IN MORIA WHERE HE ACTUALLY LISTS HOW MANY ORCS EACH MEMBER KILLS I REMEMBER BOOMIER HAVING ONE OR TWO MORE THAN ARAGON LIKE IT WAS TO OR SOMETHING AND GIMLI AND PERGOLAS HAVE OR ALSO I THINK IT'S DESCRIBED THAT THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE DEAD ORCS SURROUNDING DEAD BODY


OUTSIDE THE FELLOWSHIP ELROD AND HIS SONS ALL HAVE STRONG CASES AND SO DOES FARAMIR AND AS EVERYONE ELSE HAS MENTIONED THERE WERE SOME PRETTY AWESOME DEEDS DONE BY PEOPLE IN THE FIRST AGE TURIN TURAMBUR IS MY FAVORITE AND PROBABLY THE BEST FIGHTING HUMAN EVER BUT THE ELVES EVERYONE ELSE IS MENTIONING CAN'T BE COMPARED TO ANYONE SHORT OF A WIZARD
SO AT THE END THE URUK AHI ARE LOOKING FOR HOBBITS TO BRING BACK TO SAURURAN WHEN THEY PICK UP MERRY AND PIPPIN THEY THINK THEY HAVE FRODO AND LEAVE

THAT'S HOW THE FELLOWSHIP DEALT WITH SO MANY ORCS
FOR ELVES I'M NOT SURE BUT I THINK I REMEMBER THE SILMARILLION SAYING THAT THE GREATEST WARRIOR OF MEN WAS HARBIN FATHER OF TARIN HE SLEW THE ENTIRE OF GOTHMOG LORD OF BARONGS AND SURVIVED BEING TORTURED IN SINGBAND ITSELF

EDIT FIXED TYPOS
HELM HAMMER-HARD KING OF ROHAN IS A CONTENDER HE IS SO BADASS DURING A WINTER WHEN FOOD AND SUPPLIES WERE SHORT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF ROHAN WERE HELD UP AT THE HORNBURG DURING A TIME OF STRIFE WITH THE DUNLENDINGS HE FOUGHT BAREHANDED HE USED NO WEAPON NO WEAPON WOULD UPON BITE HIM THERE ARE ACCOUNTS OF HIM SNEAKING OUT AT NIGHT COVERED IN A WHITE PELT AND HE WOULD TAKE OUT ENEMY CAMPS BY HIMSELF HE WOULD BLOW HIS HORN WHICH WOULD SOUND THROUGH THE WHOLE LAND BEFORE HE LEFT THE HORNBURG AND THE ENEMY WOULD SHIT THEMSELVES ONE MORNING THEY SAW HIM OUTSIDE OF THE GATE FROZEN TO DEATH WITH HIS EYES STILL OPEN READY TO FIGHT THEY BELIEVE
PROBABLY GANDALF IS DON'T LET HIS OLDNESS FOOL YOU HE IS QUICK NIMBLE AND STRONG
DON'T FORGET SOME OF THESE CHARACTERS HAVE CENTURIES OF BATTLE EXPERIENCE

IMO THE BEST ALL-ROUND FIGHTER IS PROBABLY ARAGON BUT AS TO WHO WOULD WIN IN A YOU CAN'T DODGE AN ARROW FROM PERGOLAS
LETS LOOK AT IT THIS WAY
IN THE MIDDLE EARTH UNIVERSE WHERE RACES ARE SEPARATED BY THOUSANDS OF MILES AND THERE ARE SONGS OF LORE THAT PRAISE THE WORTHY FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THERE IS VERY MUCH A HERO CULTURE THAT IS HARD TO IMAGINE IN CULTURE WHERE YOU CAN BECOME FAMOUS IN MINUTES AND FORGOTTEN IN ARAGON PERGOLAS GIMLI AND BOOMIER WERE THE BADDEST OF THE BAD THE SULTANAS OF SWAT THE COLOSSUS OF CLOUTS ETC THEY WERE CHOSEN BY THEIR PEOPLE TO MAKE THE LONG AND DANGEROUS JOURNEY TO THE COUNCIL OF ELROD BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY PROVED THEMSELVES AS GREAT THEIR QUEST IN THE WAR OF THE RING WILL IN TURN CEMENT THEIR ACTIONS IN THE ANNALS OF MIDDLE EARTH HISTORY FOREVER THEIR PEOPLE ESSENTIALLY CHOSE THEM TO BE HEROES ARAGON WILL BECOME THE GREATEST MAN TO LIVE GIMLI WILL PROBABLY BE HONORED MORE THAN AURIN PERGOLAS THE SON OF THE KING OF THE WOODELVES IS BEING GROOMED FOR THE POSITION OF KING OF KIRKWOOD SEVERAL TIMES IN THE BOOKS IT SAYS THAT NO OTHER COULD HAVE DONE IT IN REFERENCE TO THINGS THESE GUYS WERE DOING GIMLI AND PERGOLAS ALONE SLEW ORCS DURING THE BATTLE OF HELMS DEEP IF ANYTHING P UNDERVALUED THEM AND UNDERESTIMATED THEIR ABILITIES IN THE MOVIES
THE MOVIE GETS THAT FINAL FIGHT SCENE BY THE RIVER QUITE RIGHT I JUST GOT DONE REREADING FELLOWSHIP

BUT ANYWAYS MOST OF THE MAIN HEROES ARE LEGENDARY FIGHTERS SOME CONSIDERED GODLIKE LIKE ANOTHER USER MENTIONED GLORFINDEL IS PROBABLY THE MOST STORIED BADASS HE ROUTINELY SCARED AWAY THINGS THAT BUMP IN THE NIGHT KINDA SUCKS THAT HE GOT SUCH A SMALL ROLE IN THE MOVIES IF AT ALL

UNLIKE GOT THE LOAR UNIVERSE EMBELLISHED ALMOST EVERY CHANCE IT CAN GET EVERY CHARACTER IS A LEGENDARY FIGHTER COOK TRAVELLER RIDDLER ETC
THE BEST ALL AROUND ASS KICKER I'M GUESSING IT WOULD BE AN ELF GANDALF WAS A GOOD FIGHTER BUT ONLY OUT OF NECESSITY CIRC WHAT WAS HAPPENED IN MIDDLE EARTH SADDENED HIM BEYOND ANYTHING

YOU HAVE TO PUT A PLUG IN FOR NUMENORIANS ARAGON ELROD ELENDIL ISILDUR CONSIDERING THEIR HISTORY THOSE DUDES WERE BAD ASS EVEN SARON COULD ONLY DEFEAT THEM THROUGH TRICKERY AND DECEIT THEY WERE TOO POWERFUL
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY IN THE MOVIE ORCS AND URUK ARE PORTRAYED AS MUSCULAR MIGHTY STRONG BEINGS WHILE IN THE BOOKS IT IS TOLD THAT THEY ARE LESS STRONG THAN HUMANS AND THAT THEY USUALLY WIN FOR THEIR SHEER NUMBER NOT FOR THEIR STRENGTH

BUT ANYWAY AT THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK THEY DON'T WIN URUK TAKE MERRIN AND PIPPIN ASSUME THEY ARE DONE SINCE THEY HAVE HOBBITS AND LEAVE
ROOSTER TEETH AND ACHIEVEMENT HUNTER HAVE SOME FANTASTIC CONTENT BUT OUT OF ALL OF IT THIS IS SOME OF MY FAVORITE
NEW ZEALANDER HERE I'VE BEEN THERE IT'S A REALLY BEAUTIFUL PLACE IN REAL LIFE
RESPECT
DAMN THAT WAS AN IMPRESSIVE WALK
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR AN ACTUAL TRANSLATION INTO KHUZDUL OR JUST A TRANSLITERATION INTO THE ANGERTHAS
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH KHUZDHUL DWARFISH AVAILABLE FOR THAT FROM WHAT I KNOW WE JUST HAVE A HANDFUL OF PHRASES AND A BUNCH OF NAMES

IF YOU JUST WANT THAT ENGLISH PHRASES TRANSLITERATED TO RUNES CHECK OUT THIS

WIKI AIRTH

THE RUNES ARE CALLED AIRTH AND THE STYLES THE DWARVES USE ARE ANGERTHAS MORIA AND ANGERTHAS ERECTOR AND THERE IS A PARAGRAPH ABOUT THEIR USE FOR ENGLISH I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THAT PHRASE IS ALREADY TRANSLITERATED SOMEWHERE

IF YOU GOOGLE THAT PHRASE AND ADD RUNES OR TATTOO YOU'LL FIND LOTS OF RESULTS THAT YOU CAN CHECK WITH THE TABLES ON THAT WIKI PAGE OR THE APPENDICES OF LOAR
THIS SHOULD BE HELPFUL

TEACHERS ROBERTSON NEW S
BILBO IS JUST MAKING AN UNSUBTLE INSULT AT LOBELIA EXPENSE SHE WAS BORN A BRACEGIRDLE FROM HAREBOTTLE
NUMBER THE MOVIES GREATLY EXAGGERATE THIS THE NAGUAL IN THE BOOKS SEEM TO ONLY TELL WHEN THEY ARE VERY CLOSE ALREADY
THEY HAVE THE RINGS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY THE ONE RING THEIR VERY BEING IS LINKED TO THE ONE RING THEY CAN PERHAPS FEEL IT'S POWER AS THE LORD OF THE NAGUAL SENSES SOMETHING OFF OUTSIDE OF MINAS MOGUL WHEN LEAVING TO SEIGE MINAS TIGRISH I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY SENSE IT TO THE POINT OF BEING ABLE TO FIND IT UNLESS IT'S VERY CLOSE BY AND EVEN THEN I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY STRONG

I ASSUME AFTER SARON RULES THE WORLD HE'D EVENTUALLY FIND IT
I DON'T THINK THEY CAN SENSE IT FROM THAT FAR AWAY GOLLUM USED IT FOR OVER YEARS AND THEY NEVER FOUND HIM
AH I SEE I ALWAYS IMAGINED THEY WERE ABLE TO SENSE WHEN CLOSE BUT OVER GREAT REACHES THEY LOST THIS SENSE IT MADE ME WONDER HOW POWERFUL THIS PERCEPTION EVEN IS AS ONE OF THE RIDERS COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE THAN FT FROM THE RING WHEN CHASING THE HOBBITS AND TRYING TO SNIFF THEM OUT WHILE THEY WERE HIDING UNDER A TREE ROOT DIRECTLY BELOW HIM
WHEN THE KING OF THE NAGUAL LEADS HIS FORCES OUT OF MINAS MOGUL HE SENSES SOMETHING AND STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND SAM AND FRODO ARE NOT TOO FAR AWAY BUT BEFORE FRODO CAN PUT IT ON HIS HAND MOVES BY SOME FORCE TOWARD THE RING THE NAGUAL CARRIES ON AGAIN
NOT SURE WHAT IT TELLS US EXACTLY BUT LATER IT SAYS THE CLOSER THE RING GETS TO WHERE IT WAS FORGED IT EXERTS EXUDES GREATER POWER

SORRY I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THIS IS FROM THE BOOK I WATCHED THE FILMS WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT BUT NOT REALLY SINCE I REREAD THE BOOKS NOW AND THEN THOUGH
THE RING WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE BEEN FOUNDATION IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE OF FELLOWSHIP GALADRIEL DOES SAY THAT THE RING WAS LOST BUT THAT IT WANTED TO BE FOUND NOT SURE WHAT THE BOOKS SAY THOUGH
THE NINE COULD ONLY SENSE IT WHEN IT WAS PUT ON OR TRYING TO COERCE THE USER INTO PUTTING IT ON ONCE IT WAS WORN THE NAGUAL COULD SENSE IT FROM ALMOST ANYWHERE IN MIDDLE EARTH HOWEVER WHEN THE RING WAS INACTIVE THE NAGUAL ACTUALLY HAD A WORSE SENSE OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT SINCE THEY WERE WRAITHS
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THEY WERE BRED TO WITHSTAND THE SUNLIGHT LIKE THE
MY GUESS THOUGH I CANNOT BACK IT UP AS MUCH I'D LIKE WOULD BE THAT THE PHRASING IMPLIES THESE TROLLS CAN PHYSICALLY SURVIVE THE SUNLIGHT AND WILL TRUDGE THROUGH IT INSTEAD OF RUNNING FOR THE NEAREST DARK CAVE SO LONG AS THERE'S SOMEONE LIKE SARON THERE TO MAKE THEM DO IT
YEAH I THINK IT'S A BREED THING TOO THERE'S NO REASON WHY THE TROLLS COULDNT BE BRED TO HANDLE LIGHT IF THE ORCS COULD

ALSO MY SON'S BIRTHDAY HIS NAME IS IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL MY HUSBAND IS NOT A LOAR FAN AND STILL DOESN'T REALIZE I TRICKED HIM

THIS IS BEAUTIFUL I AM DEFINITELY SENDING HER A CARD FOR ME THIS IS WHAT BEING A PART OF A FANDOM IS ABOUT


I HOPE A LOT OF PEOPLE SHOW UP FOR HER PARTY I'M GONNA TRY TO BUY SOMETHING OFF HER WISH LIST FOR HERALDRY
IF THIS WASN'T IN A DIFFERENT STATE I WOULD ABSOLUTELY GO I'VE BEEN SPENDING TOO MUCH LATELY BUT I DEFINITELY WANT TO DONATE EITHER TO THE PARTY OR SEND A GIFT NOT EVEN BECAUSE SHE'S AUTISTIC I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT MAKES IT MORE MEANINGFUL BUT BECAUSE SHE'S THROWING A LOAR BIRTHDAY PARTY AND INVITING OTHERS KUDOS FOR HER AND WHOEVER ORGANIZED THIS FOR PUTTING HERSELF OUT THERE IN A BIG WAY
I'M SENDING HER A LOAR CARD FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW I HOPE HER BIRTHDAY IS GREAT
REMOVED
EXCELLENT
THAT'S AWESOME VERY UNIQUE IT'S REFRESHING FROM ALL THE TREES OF CONDOR AND QUENDA
CAN CONFIRM HAVE ABOUT HOURS IN WARRAND NO OTHER GAME CAN I BE SO OK WITH STARTING OVER AND CHOOSING A DIFFERENT PATHOLOGY GRAPHICS ARE QUITE DATED BUT THERE IS REAL SOUL IN THIS GAME

THIRD AGE IS AN OK MOD FOR IT BUT I RECOMMEND VIKING CONQUEST ENDOR OR FLORIS
THANKS I HADN'T SEEN THAT MOD BEFORE WARRAND IS A GREAT GAME I'LL BE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THIS
DOES IT HAVE MULTIPLAYER COOP
IN SHADOW OF MORDOR ORCS AREN'T THE TERRORIZER YOU ARE
THERE'S A NEW ONE CALLED FALL OF MORDOR I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND A LINK TO A VIDEO OF IT
ONE UNRELEASED ONE THAT HAS AN AWESOME CONCEPT IS LORD OF THE RINGS THE WHITE COUNCIL
I THINK THAT LINE JUST MEANS THAT GANDALF USED TO SET OFF FIREWORKS AT THE OLD MIDSUMMER EVE PARTIES WHICH OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE AFTER THE GUY PASSED AWAY THOUGH I SUPPOSE IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT HE BROUGHT SOME FIREWORKS TO HIS OLD BUDDY'S FUNERAL THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY EPIC SENDOFF
YEAH THE OLD TOOK WAS FRIEND AND PROBABLY LOVED HIS FIREWORKS THEREFORE GANDALF DID IT AS A TOKEN TO HIM
FIREWORKS IS GREAT AND ALL BUT I THINK I'D RATHER JUST BURN MYSELF WITH MY LAST-BORN SON YA KNOW LIKE THE HEATHEN KINGS OF OLD
JUST MAKE SURE YOU DIE ON LATE DECEMBER AND THAT YOUR FUNERAL IS AT OF THE 1ST JANUARY
DO THEY HAVE PINTS
YOU CAN TAKE A VIRTUAL TOUR OF THE PUB ON GOOGLE EARTH STREET VIEW
GO TO N W

IS THE PRANCING PONY THE BASIS FOR EVERY D D PATHFINDER STORY THAT BEGINS IN A BAR
DOES ANYONE KNOW OF ANY OTHER LOAR THEMED BARS PUBS THAT ARE IN THE US WOULD LOVE TO TRAVEL OVERSEAS BUT I'M QUITE BUSY AND BROKE BAD COMBO
DID YOU SEE PERGOLAS AND GIMLI HAVE A YES I REALIZE THEY DID THE DRINKOFF IN ROHAN BUT MAYBE THEY'RE ON A VACATION C
WAS THERE ANY KIND OF MEAT I HEARD IT WAS TAKEN OFF THE MENU
WEBSITE
GALLERY

AND GOOGLE MAPS

HALF ORCS WHAT
IT'S NOT WORTH TRYING TO LOOK FOR ANY TYPE OF REASONABLE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE HOBBIT MOVIES AND THE ACTUAL LORE YOU WON'T FIND ANY AND ATTEMPTING TO DO SO CAN ONLY END IN FRUSTRATION AND ANGER THAT SOMETHING AS SOULLESS AND UNFAITHFUL AS THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES COULD BE PRODUCED
BUT OLD RORY BRANDYBUCK WAS NOT SO SURE NEITHER AGE NOR AN ENORMOUS
DINNER HAD CLOUDED HIS WITS AND HE SAID TO HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW ESMERALDA
THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY IN THIS MY DEAR I BELIEVE THAT MAD BAGGIES IS OFF
AGAIN SILLY OLD FOOL BUT WHY WORRY HE HASN'T TAKEN THE VITTLES WITH HIM
HE CALLED LOUDLY TO FRODO TO SEND THE WINE ROUND AGAIN

I'M HAVING A GLASS OF BEERENBURG GIN ON THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY TO BILBO TO FRODO
IS THE SILMARILLION REALLY ENORMOUS I THOUGHT PEOPLE'S CRITICISM WAS MORE THAT'S IT'S DENSE AND UNINTERESTING NOT THAT I AGREE WITH THAT BUT I MEAN MY COPY OF THE SILMARILLION IS LESS THAN PAGES DO I HAVE THE WRONG EDITION OR SOMETHING
BACCIO ARKENSTONE
FORGOT MOBILE USERS DON'T SEE THE IMAGER COMMENTS WHOOPS

WELL THIEF I SMELL YOU AND I FEEL YOUR AIR I HEAR YOUR BREATH COME ALONG HELP YOURSELF AGAIN THERE IS PLENTY AND TO SPARE

BUT HARRY WAS NOT QUITE SO UNLEARNED IN AS HERMIONE HAD DRILLED EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT INTO HIM AND IF SMUG HOPED TO GET HIM TO COME NEARER SO EASILY HE WAS DISAPPOINTED
NO THANK YOU O SMUG THE TREMENDOUS HE REPLIED I DID NOT COME FOR PRESENTS I ONLY WISHED TO HAVE A LOOK AT YOU AND SEE IF YOU WERE TRULY AS GREAT AS TALES SAY I DID NOT BELIEVE THEM

DO YOU NOW SAID THE DRAGON SOMEWHAT FLATTERED EVEN THOUGH HE DID NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT

TRULY SONGS AND TALES FALL UTTERLY SHORT OF THE REALITY O SMUG THE CHIEFEST AND GREATEST OF CALAMITIES REPLIED HARRY

YOU HAVE NICE MANNERS FOR A THIEF AND A LIAR SAID THE DRAGON YOU SEEM FAMILIAR WITH MY NAME BUT I DON T SEEM TO REMEMBER SMELLING YOU BEFORE WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE DO YOU COME FROM MAY I ASK

YOU MAY INDEED I COME FROM UNDER THE STAIR AND UNDER THE STAIRS AND OVER THE STAIRS MY PATHS LED AND THROUGH THE AIR I AM HE THAT WALKS UNSEEN

SO I CAN WELL BELIEVE SAID SMUG BUT THAT IS HARDLY YOUR USUAL NAME

I AM THE THE THE PATRONS CONJURER I WAS CHOSEN BY BLUE-WHITE FLAMES

LOVELY TITLES SNEERED THE DRAGON BUT LUCKY NUMBERS DON T ALWAYS COME OFFICIAL

I AM HE THAT CATCHES SNITCHES OF GOLDEN AND AM THE YOUNGEST SEEKER IN A CENTURY I CAME TO POSSESS THE WAND BUT THE WAND CHOSE ME

THESE DON T SOUND SO CREDITABLE SCOFFED SMUG

I AM THE FRIEND OF FAWKES AND THE GUEST OF SNUFFLES I AM THE AND I AM THE CHOSEN ONE WENT ON HARRY BEGINNING TO BE PLEASED WITH HIS RIDDLING

THAT S BETTER SAID SMUG BUT DON T LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN AWAY WITH YOU
PFFT
MAN SEEING THIS VERSION REALLY REMINDS ME HOW WELL PETER GOLLUM WAS DONE
DAMN THAT'S DISTURBING GREAT JOB TO THE GUY THAT DID IT ALWAYS MY FAVORITE COSTUME FROM THE MOVIES

FIRST YES THAT IS A FINE FINELY CRAFTED TATTOO

SECOND WHY WHY THIS CHARACTER
VERY COOL BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT SEE GOOGLY EYES
HE DEED GANDALF HE DEED
THAT IS FUCKING AWESOME EXCELLENT EXECUTION
I'M NOT TERRIBLY FOND OF THE WAY THEY HANDLED THE CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE BUT THAT IS ONE IMPRESSIVE TATTOO
TRAVIS GREENOUGH FROM CLOSED CASKET TATTOOS IN AJAX ONTARIO
AMAZING LOVE THIS VERY MUCH MY WIFE SAID I WONDER WHAT HIS MOTHER THINKS ABOUT THAT
SICK
BOLD AND IRREGULAR CHOICE AND I LIKE IT
DUDE
WHAT AN ARTIST
THAT'S AWESOME I GOT A TREEBEARD TATTOO LAST SUNDAY
I BET YOU LISTEN TO METAL
THAT'S SO METAL
SO GREAT TATTOO
I WAS EXPECTING A FACE TATTOO AND WAS DISAPPOINTED
THE ARTIST IS TRAVIS GREENOUGH FROM CLOSED CASKET CUSTOM TATTOOS IN AJAX ONTARIO
DELETED
HE DASNT LOOK LIKE THAT THOUGH AND I HAVE TO BELIEVE ANYONE WHO IS INTO ANY OF MORGOTHS DOWNSTREAM FAILURES DASNT REALLY APPRECIATE LOAR
IS THERE ANYONE WITH WIT TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE GOT THAT TATTOO
DELETED
DELETED
I WOULD THINK MAKE DECORATIONS TO LOOK LIKE BIRTHDAY IN FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RECATCH THAT MASTERPIECE YOU COULD GOOGLE BIRTHDAY IN IMAGES I VOTE FOR A SHIRE THEME IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THOUGH THAT I ALWAYS FELT A STRONG CONNECTION TO THE HOBBIT CHARACTERS SO I WOULD LOVE A SHIRE PRANCING PONY THEME ASK YOUR SO WHO HE RELATES TO MOST AND MAYBE USE THAT INFO AS A STARTING POINT
SECTIONS THEBAULT THIS HAS GREAT FOOD IDEAS
THESE COME IN SNOW GLOBES I'M GETTING ONE
I THOUGHT THERE WERE 2 OF THESE AND THEY WERE BOTH LOST IN THE WAY OF THE RINGS
WHERE CAN I GET IT
HERE I GUESS BEST BET IS OTHER WEBSITES
MASTER MERIADOC SAID ARAGON IF YOU THINK THAT I HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS AND THE REALM OF CONDOR WITH FIRE AND SWORD TO BRING HERBS TO A CARELESS SOLDIER WHO THROWS AWAY HIS GEAR YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF YOUR PACK HAS NOT BEEN FOUND THEN YOU MUST SEND FOR THE OF THIS HOUSE AND HE WILL TELL YOU THAT HE DID NOT KNOW THE HERB YOU DESIRE HAD ANY VIRTUES BUT THAT IT IS CALLED WESTMANSWEED BY THE VULGAR AND GALENAS BY THE NOBLE AND OTHER NAMES IN OTHER TONGUES MORE LEARNED AND AFTER ADDING A FEW HALF-FORGOTTEN RHYMES THAT HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HE WILL REGRETFULLY INFORM YOU THAT THERE IS NONE IN THE HOUSE AND HE WILL LEAVE YOU TO REFLECT ON THE HISTORY OF TONGUES

AND OF COURSE PACK WAS RIGHT BY HIS BED WHICH ARAGON KNEW QUITE WELL

I ALSO HAVE A PET THEORY THAT THE MASTER OF THE HOUSES OF HEALING IS TZOLKIN INSERTING HIMSELF INTO THE STORY AND POKING FUN AT HIMSELF AT THE SAME TIME
WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHELDON AND SARON

HIS CAT HE CALLS HER BUT SHE OWNS HIM NOT

THE JOKE BEING THAT CATS OWN PEOPLE AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
ITS BEEN YEARS SINCE I READ THE BOOKS SO APART FROM THE EXCERPT YOU'VE MENTIONED I CAN THINK OF ONLY ONE OTHER ITS MORE A SCENE

GANDALF FRODO SAM MERRY AND PIPPIN ARE RIDING BACK TO THE SHIRE AND STOPPING AT BREE PRANCING PONY FOR THE NIGHT NOB SEES THEM COMING

NOB MR BIRLIEMAN THEY'RE HERE OR IS IT THEY'RE BACK

BIRLIEMAN OH I'LL LEARN THEM

BIRLIEMAN RUNS OUT OF THE INN CUDGEL IN HAND THEN HE SEES WHO IT IS

BIRLIEMAN NOB YOU FOOL CAN'T YOU TELL ME WHEN ITS FRIENDS WHO'VE COME VISITING

OH AND BILL KICKING BILL IN THE BACK SIDE I KNEW THAT PONY WOULD SURVIVE

APART FROM THE BOOKS THERE IS AN EXCERPT FROM A BIOGRAPHY OF TZOLKIN I READ WHICH GOES LIKE THIS

ONCE THE LOAR WAS PUBLISHED TZOLKIN GOT A LETTER FROM MAN NAMED SAM GAMGEE SAM HADN'T READ THE BOOKS BUT HAD HEARD OF HIS NAMESAKE

TZOLKIN DELIGHTED BY THIS COINCIDENCE SENT HIM A COPY OF THE BOOKS AFTERWARD HE DREADED RECEIVING A LETTER FROM
MY FAVORITE IS WHEN THORIN CO ARE IN KIRKWOOD AND BOMBER IS COMPLAINING ABOUT HAVING TO GO LAST WHEN THEY CROSS THE WATER HE SAYS IT'S SOMEBODY TURN TO GO LAST THEN THORIN COMES BACK WITH A STRAIGHT UP YOU SHOULD NOT BE SO FAT
GANDALF BASICALLY ADMITTING HE IS A HE IS TOLD TO TAKE ANY HORSE HE WANTS AS LONG AS HE MAKES HIMSELF SCARCE AND HE TAKES THE TOP HORSE OF THE KING SHADOWFAX HE EVEN ADMITS HE KNEW THAT THRODDEN WOULDN'T LIKE IT
I ALWAYS GET A KICK OUT OF THE FACT THAT WHEN FRODO SELLS BAG END HE'S LEAVES THE DISHES FOR THE
THAT QUOTE IS GOLDEN
THE HOBBIT WHEN GANDALF IS DISTRACTING BEHORN WITH STORIES SO THE COMPANY CAN GET TO HIS HOUSE
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED SINCE HEAD IS NOW SACRED LET US FIND ONE THAT IS RIGHT TO CLEAVE
WOW I WAS JUST GOING TO POST THE PART WHERE GIMLI IS SO TORN BETWEEN RAGE AND JOY BUT NEVER MIND
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS ARTISTS WOULD BE BETTER OFF DRAWING PAINTING THEIR OWN RENDITIONS OF THESE CHARACTERS WHILE IT'S COOL TO SEE A PENCIL DRAWING OF IAN MCKELLAN AS GANDALF IT WOULD BE COOLER TO SEE THEIR INTERPRETATION OF HOW EG GANDALF WOULD LOOK BASED ON THEIR INTERPRETATIONS OF WRITING JUST A THOUGHT
THE WAY IS SHUT
WELL THAT'S AMAZING
THAT WATERMARK THOUGH HOLY CHRIST
IT'S DRAWN USING DIFFERENT COLOURED BIRO PENS THE DUDE IS VERY TALENTED
I ALWAYS FELT IT WAS A BIT OF A MISNAME TO GIVE PROMINENCE TO THE TWO HALVES OF LINDON RATHER THAN JUST NAMING THE WHOLE THING LINDON YES THEY ARE SEPARATE IN CERTAIN SENSES BUT IT'S REALLY ONE LAND UNDER ONE RULER FIRST THEN BIRDMAN WITH ITS CAPITAL AT THE GREY HAVENS
I HAVE THIS MAP TOO IT WAS MY REDDIN SECRET SANTA GIFT FROM WAY BACK THE THING THAT BUGS ME ABOUT THIS MAP IS THAT IT DOESN'T SHOW US CONDOR OR MORDOR AT ALL AND THE RESOLUTION IS MPH BUT IT'S STILL AN AWESOME THING TO WAKE UP TO AND IS A GREAT CONVERSATION STARTER FROM TIME TO TIME
REMOVED
I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME VERY GOOD VIDEOS OUT THERE AND I'M CERTAIN THAT SOME OTHER PEOPLE ON THIS SUB WILL BE ABLE TO POINT THEM OUT TO YOU

THAT BEING SAID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WILL GIVE YOU THE SAME LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE AND SATISFACTION AS ACTUALLY READING THE ANCILLARY TEXTS AND LEARNING THESE THINGS STRAIGHT FROM THE SOURCE I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING THE SILMARILLION PROBABLY MORE THAN ONCE AND THEN THE UNFINISHED TALES AND ALL VOLUMES OF THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH THE TIME EXPENDITURE IN MY OPINION
I'LL ALSO POINT TO THE MIDDLE-EARTH LORE VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE I MAY BE A BIT BIASED AS I WAS PART OF THE TEAM THAT ASSEMBLED THE VIDEOS BUT I DO THINK THEY ARE QUITE GOOD
WATCH V
I WATCHED THESE VIDEOS
THEY ARE QUITE ENTERTAINING TO WATCH BUT NOT THAT EXTENSIVE AS THE BOOKS
SEARCH FOR CIVILISATION EX ON YOUTUBE HE HAS LOAR LORE BUT ALSO STARWARD AND GAME OF THRONES
LOOK UP ARACHIC GALUDIRITHON ON YOUTUBE HE HAS A LORE SERIES THAT'S QUITE ENJOYABLE
AM I RIGHT IN REMEMBERING THAT CHURDAN IS THE ONLY ELF COOL ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY HAVE A BEARD

HE DEFINITELY HAD A BEARD ALTHOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER EVER READING ANY SPECIFIC REASON FOR THAT I DON'T THINK BEARDS WERE IN ELVES JUST THAT THEY ARE EXTREMELY RARE

AS FAR AS I REMEMBER HE IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL ELVES THAT AWOKE IN CUÍVENEN

SOMEONE CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY ACTUAL EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO AWAKE IN CUIVIENEN HE COULD EASILY BE THE SON OF ONE OF THE VERY FIRST I'M NOT DISCOUNTING THE POSSIBILITY BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS EVER CONFIRMED

FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SEA AND NEVER WENT TO ALIENOR UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRD AGE

THAT MUCH IS TRUE THOUGH

DAD MAHTAN ALSO HAS A BEARD AND REPORTEDLY HAD IT AT A MUCH YOUNGER AGE ALSO GINGER FOR THE WIN
WHAT HAPPENED TO HAWAII
I THINK MT RAINIER SHOULD BE INCLUDED OVER IN WASHINGTON CONSIDERING IT'S HEIGHT RELATIVE TO ITS SURROUNDINGS LOOKS LIKE THE LONELY MOUNTAIN AND STUFF DEFINITELY WOULD BE A MAJOR FEATURE ON ANY MAP OF THE WORLD TZOLKIN MADE

PROBABLY LIKE A POTATO FARMER THAT NEVER ENDS UP DOING ANYTHING EXCITING SPECIES IS IRRELEVANT
ELF NOLUDAR MORE SPECIFIC BECAUSE THEY SPEAK QUENDA WHICH IS BASED ON MY NATIVE LANGUAGE
EITHER A DWARF OR HOBBIT
I'M A DÚNADAN OF THE SOUTH THE 4TH RULING STEWARD OF CONDOR
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE DUINDAIN I WOULD PROBABLY BE A RANGER OF THE NORTH WHO GREW UP IN RIVENDELL
JUST MORE PETER JACKSON MOVIE NONSENSE IN THE BOOKS IT WASN'T EVEN ISILDUR THAT DEFEATED HIM ELENDIL AND SLEW SARON ALTHOUGH THEY THEMSELVES DIED IN THE PROCESS ISILDUR CAME UP AFTER THE FACT AND REMOVED THE RING-FINGER AND THE RING FROM HIS VANQUISHED FOE
IT WAS THE FIRECRACKERS HE ARE FOR BREAKFAST

OR IT WAS A MOVIE THING YOUR OPINION IS AS VALID AS FOR ME I'M GOING WITH FIRECRACKERS
THOSE CAME WITH THE SPECIAL EXTENDED DVD EDITION OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING I HAVE THEM THEY ARE COOL
I HAVE THE SAME ONES BOUGHT THEM IN A GARAGE SALE MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO
MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT KINDA CRAZY SHITS OUT IN THE EAST OF MIDDLE EARTH
I LIKE THE ART STYLE AND OF COURSE THE AMBIGUITY OF NOT KNOWING THE OUTCOME

BUT TECHNICALLY WE KNOW ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT THEM AND IT'S EVEN STRANGER IN THE MOVIES THEIR NAMES ALTAR AND PARLANDO ARE NOT MENTIONED IN ANY WORKS THE MOVIE PEOPLE HAD THE RIGHTS TO SO THEY COULDN'T MENTION THEIR NAMES THAT IS WHY GANDALF SAYS HE CAN'T REMEMBER THEIR NAMES A JOKE ABOUT NOT OWNING THE RIGHTS
OK FICTIONAL HISTORY LESSON TIME

IN THE SECOND AGE THE ELVES DESIRED TO HOLD BACK THE CHANGES BROUGHT ON BY PASSING TIME THEY STARTED CREATING MAGIC RINGS TO HELP THEM DO THIS THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THEY DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING

SO THEY ARE APPROACHED BY SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE AN EMISSARY OF THE ALAR HE CALLS HIMSELF ANNATAR THE LORD OF GIFTS DOESN'T TRUST HIM BUT HE TEACHES THE ELVES RINGLORE AND WITH HIS HELP THEY MAKE RINGS OF POWER CELEBRIMBOR USES THIS RINGLORE AND ALONE AND IN SECRET CREATES MORE RINGS THE MOST POWERFUL OF ALL OF THEM ANNATAR THEN LEAVES

NOW ANNATAR WAS SECRETLY SARON ALL ALONG HE SAW WHAT THE ELVES WERE TRYING TO DO AND THOUGHT OF A WAY TO ENSLAVE THEM HE TAUGHT THEM RINGLORE AND HELPED IN THEIR MAKING INHERENTLY CORRUPTING THE DURING THEIR FORGING NOW IN MORDOR HE CREATES A MASTER RING A RING THAT WILL CONTROL ALL THE OTHERS EVEN THE WHICH HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF AND NEVER TOUCHED ARE SUBJECT TO THE MASTER RING SINCE THEY WERE MADE WITH KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM SARON TO DO THIS HE WAS OBLIGATED TO PUT MOST OF HIS POWER WITHIN THE RING TO ANSWER YOUR OTHER QUESTION NO ONE ELSE HAD THE POWER OR THE SKILL TO MAKE ANOTHER MASTER RING

SO SARON PUTS THE ONE RING ON AND THE ELVES ARE IMMEDIATELY AWARE OF HIM THEY REMOVE THEIR RINGS ARE HIDE THEM

SARON IS PISSED HIS PLAN DIDN'T WORK

HE WAGES WAR ON THE ELVES LAYING WASTE TO MUCH OF REGION OVER TIME HE CAPTURES CELEBRIMBOR AND TORTURES HIM CELEBRIMBOR REVEALS THE LOCATION OF THE BUT NOT THE HE MADE NOT THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE RINGS

SARON CAPTURES THE ALL THE RINGS EXCEPT THE HE GIVES THEM OUT TO MEN AND DWARVES HOPING TO ENSNARE THEM DWARVES PROVE RESILIENT TO HIS CONTROL BUT ARE STILL CORRUPTED BY THE RINGS THE MEN HOWEVER FALL WHOLLY UNDER HIS CONTROL THEY BECOME PERMENANTLLY INVIABLE FROM PROLONGED USE OF THE RINGS THEY BECOME THE NAGUAL MOST TERRIBLE SERVANTS

THIS IS STILL ONLY THE SECOND AGE A LOT MORE HAPPENS BETWEEN HERE AND THE WAR OF THE RING AT THE END OF THE THIRD AGE
WHY COULDN'T ANOTHER MORE POWER RING BE MADE TO CONTROL THE RING THAT CONTROLLED ALL RINGS

I BELIEVE THIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE NO ONE IN MIDDLE-EARTH POSSESSED SUPERIOR CRAFT TO THAT OF SARON PHIAL WOULD NOT EVEN FUNCTION AT FORGES

IN HIS GREAT NEED HE DREW OUT ONCE MORE THE PHIAL OF GALADRIEL BUT IT WAS PALE AND COLD IN HIS TREMBLING HAND AND THREW NO LIGHT INTO THAT STIFLING DARK HE WAS COME TO THE HEART OF THE REALM OF SARON AND THE FORGES OF HIS ANCIENT MIGHT GREATEST IN MIDDLE-EARTH ALL OTHER POWERS WERE HERE SUBDUED MOUNT DOOM

FOR SARON TO EVEN GAIN CONTROL OVER THE RINGS OF POWER HE HAD TO PUT THE MAJORITY OF HIS OWN POWER MUCH OF THE STRENGTH AND WILL OF SARON PASSED INTO THAT ONE RING FOR THE POWER OF THE WAS VERY GREAT AND THAT WHICH SHOULD GOVERN THEM MUST BE A THING OF SURPASSING POTENCY OF THE RINGS OF POWER AND THE THIRD AGE INTO THE MAKING OF THE ONE

HE LET A GREAT PART OF HIS OWN FORMER POWER PASS INTO IT SO THAT HE COULD RULE ALL THE OTHERS THE SHADOW OF THE PAST

BEFORE REGION WAS SACKED BY SARON THE ELVES SAVED THE THREE SINCE THEY HELD THESE IN HIGHEST REGARD AND THEY POSSESSED THE GREATEST POWERS OF THE RINGS OF POWER AND THE THIRD AGE THEY WERE HANDED OUT TO GALADRIEL AND CHURDAN ILYA RING OF AIR WAS GIVEN BY HIM TO ELROD THETHIRD AGE AND CHURDAN SURRENDERED HIS ANARYA RING OF FIRE TO MITHRANDIR GALADRIEL HELD ONTO HER OWN KENYA RING OF WATER

WHO GAVE THESE RINGS

I MENTIONED ALREADY THE THREE THAT WERE HANDED OUT TO THEIR GUARDIANS BY CELEBRIMBOR THE OTHERS SARON CAPTURED AND DOLED OUT TO MEN AND DWARVES

BUT SARON GATHERED INTO HIS HANDS ALL THE REMAINING RINGS OF POWER AND HE DEALT THEM OUT TO THE OTHER PEOPLES OF MIDDLE-EARTH HOPING THUS TO BRING UNDER HIS SWAY ALL THOSE THAT DESIRED SECRET POWER BEYOND THE MEASURE OF THEIR KIND SEVEN HE GAVE TO THE DWARVES BUT TO MEN HE GAVE NINE FOR MEN PROVED IN THIS MATTER AS IN OTHERS THE READIEST TO HIS WILLIAM OF THE RINGS OF POWER AND THE THIRD AGE

IN THE THIRD AGE AFTER SARON LOST THE ONE HE GATHERED TO HIMSELF THE RINGS HE HAD GIVEN OUT OR AT LEAST THOSE OF THEM HE COULD FIND GANDALF SAID FOUR OF THE SEVEN WERE CONSUMED BY DRAGONS SO ONLY THREE HE HAS RECOVERED THE SHADOW OF THE PAST AND ALL OF THE NINE HE HAS GATHERED TO HIMSELF IT IS BELIEVED THAT SARON STOLE ONE OF THE SEVEN FROM THRAIN AFTER HE HAD HIM IMPRISONED IN DOL GOULDER

IN THE YEAR THRAIN SET OUT FROM THERE ARED ALUIN TO RETURN TO THE LONELY MOUNTAIN WHILE WANDERING IN THE LANDS EAST OF THE ALNUIN HE WAS CAPTURED AND IMPRISONED IN DOL GOULDER WHERE THE RING WAS TAKEN FROM HIM THE QUEST OF ERECTOR

THESE WERE NEVERTHELESS ALL ELDEN RINGS MEANT FOR THE ELVES SARON MADE USE OF THEM TO TRY AND ENSAFE THE FREE PEOPLES
THE OTHER ANSWERS HERE ARE EXCELLENTLY WRITTEN AND ENTIRELY ACCURATE

BUT JUST CAME HERE TO SAY IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THIS STUFF CONSIDER READING THE SILMARILLION THEY DON'T GET TO THE RINGS UNTIL THE VERY END BUT THE WHOLE THING IS ABOUT THE ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE WORLD

PUTS THE LOAR TRILOGY INTO BETTER PERSPECTIVE GIVES A GREATER MOTIVE TO THE EVENTS OF THE STORY AND AN EVEN DEEPER HISTORY THEY HINT AT SOME OF THAT ANCIENT HISTORY IN LOAR BUT THE SILMARILLION TELLS THE WHOLE DEAL
EDIT HEY IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN GET NEW ONES TOO AT POUNDS EACH

AS FAR AS I KNOW GETTING A MATCHED SET IN HARDCOVER IS PRETTY MUCH DOWN TO BUYING FIRST EDITIONS WHERE YOU CAN SITES LIKE ABEBOOKS ARE HELPFUL TO SOME EXTENT YOU CAN ALSO TRY YOUR LUCK AT EBAY

I THINK THERE ARE TRADE PAPERBACK SETS BY HARPERCOLLINS THAT HAD A UNIFIED LOOK TOO IF YOU CAN FIND THEM
IF YOU WANT MATCHING HARDCOVERS OUTSIDE OF THE VOLUME SETS PREPARE TO SHELL OUT SOME SERIOUS CASH

THE US VERSIONS HAVE NEVER MATCHED AS HOUGHTON MIFFLIN PUT THE MIDDLE DUBBED THE HISTORY OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS IN A DIFFERENT STYLE THOUGH THEY LOOK LIKE THIS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PRINTED IN A LONG TIME SO YOU'LL HAVE TO GO SECOND HAND THROUGH VARIOUS SITES

OTHERWISE CAN GO FOR THE UK EDITIONS CAN EITHER TRY TO FIND THEM INDIVIDUALLY OR COULD OPT TO GO FOR EDITIONS AVAILABLE FROM AT A PIECE BUT THEY'LL MATCH AND BE VERY SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE TO THE ORIGINALS THOUGH ALL DUST JACKETS ETC WOULD HAVER HARPERCOLLINS BRANDING
I'M CURIOUS WHY ARE YOU OPPOSED TO THE VOLUME BOXED SET I HAVE THEM AND THINK THEY'RE GREAT
NICE TRY SARON
MORDOR ALSO KNOWN AS AMAZON
MAKE BEAUTIFUL TZOLKIN JEWELRY
DID YOU MAKE THIS ACCOUNT SPECIFICALLY TO ASK THIS QUESTION
FIREWORKS BEER MEAD WEED SUBSTITUTING FOR LONGBOTTOM LEAF IN OLD LIMEY WOOD PIPES

I'D READ SOME EXCERPTS MAYBE FROM THE LAY OF LUTHIER I KNOW BILBO TRANSLATED THE SILMARILLION I KNOW THERE'S A SCENE IN THE HOBBIT DESCRIBING BRAVEST THING HE EVER DID WHEN GOING IN TO SEE SMUG FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT'S A GREAT ONE
SONGS SINGALONGS THE HOBBIT IS FULL OF THEM OF ALL DIFFERENT KINDS THE SONG SUNG BY THORIN AND CO IN HOUSE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES
THAT IS UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING HATS OFF TO YOU MANUAL
SO WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU DOING IN THIS CLIP TO MY VERY UNTRAINED EYE IT LOOKS PRETTY FINISHED
HOW MUCH DOES ONE LIKE THIS RUN FOR USUALLY
I PERSONALLY LIKE THE GANDALF THE GREY ONE BETTER BUT THIS IS STILL AMAZING
AMAZING DETAIL WOW
ONE MAY BE THE SADDEST METALLICA SONG EVER GANDALF LOOKS GREAT

WOULD YOU CONSIDER SELLING THAT SCULPT IN TH SCALE
LOL WITH ONE PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND
GOTHMOG WENT DOWN IN GONDOLIER THAT WAS THE ONLY NAME ON THE EVIL SIDE TO DIE OF COURSE BY THAT POINT MORGOTH DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF HIGH PROFILE UNDERLINGS LEFT PLENTY OF TOADIES THOUGH

EVIL IN MIDDLE EARTH FADES ALL POWER IS ESSENTIALLY DRAWN FROM ILUVATAR MORGOTH HAD NO CHANCE AGAINST GOD'S ARMY THEY COULD STROLL IN AT PEAK AND WRECK HIM

MORGOTH BY HIMSELF OUTCLASSED ANYONE IN MIDDLE EARTH BEFORE THEY SHOWED UP BUT HE CLEARLY LOSES POWER INCREMENTALLY WITH TIME THE CONSEQUENCES REALLY AREN'T CONDITIONAL ILUVATAR TO FACE TELLS HIM THAT NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES EVER IT WILL ONLY BE BECAUSE ILUVATAR DESIGNED IT TO BE SO
HOW YOUR SON
SOME OF MY BEST MEMORIES COME FROM WATCHING THE LORD OF THE RINGS FILMS WITH MY FAMILY GLAD TO HEAR YOU GUYS ENJOYED THEM
PRETTY SURE IT'S AN ATTEMPT AT HAPPINESS WITH SOME MISTAKES
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MODE THEY ARE USING OR WHAT LANGUAGE THEY ARE WRITING IN BEST I CAN TELL IT'S ENGLISH ORTHOGRAPHIC WITH A COUPLE OF MISTAKES

MY FIRST INSTINCT WOULD BE TO SAY IT READS BATTINESS BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT ISN'T A REAL WORD IF THE MEHTA ON THE SECOND TENGWAR WERE PLACED CLOSER TO THE LAVA IT COULD POSSIBLY REPRESENT THE ENGLISH LETTER P INSTEAD OF TWO T'S AS I HAD ORIGINALLY ASSUMED IN THAT CASE IT WOULD READ HAPPINESS

ONCE AGAIN THAT ISN'T A WORD BUT IT IS AT LEAST RECOGNIZABLY SIMILAR TO AN ENGLISH WORD MOVING THE MEHTA CLOSER TO THE LAVA AGAIN ON THE SECOND TENGWAR AND THEN ADDING AN ADDITIONAL MEHTA SLIGHTLY BELOW THE FIRST WOULD REPRESENT THE LETTER P TWICE IN WHICH CASE THIS WORD WOULD BE HAPPINESS

IF I HAD TO HAZARD A GUESS THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST CHOICE HOWEVER IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE AN INCREDIBLE COINCIDENCE THAT A RECOGNIZABLE WORD EMERGED THAT SHE'S NOT TRANSLITERATING FROM ENGLISH AND IS WRITING IN EITHER A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE OR A DIFFERENT MODE OR BOTH

ALSO HAPPINESS IS KIND OF A WEIRD MESSAGE TO SEND IN ISOLATION TO A FRIEND IT DOESN'T REALLY CONVEY ANY SORT OF IDEA OR MESSAGE IT'S JUST AN INDIVIDUAL WORD THIS MAKES ME THINK IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE I'VE TRANSLATED INCORRECTLY

SORRY IF THIS WASN'T HELPFUL I DID MY BEST
THANK YOU U PURELYSC AND U TRIAREAL I WILL ASK HER IF MY PHONE A FRIEND WAS A SUCCESS
I WOULD GUESS IT IS A GOOD DAY
HEY I PAINTED THAT HOW ARE YOU KIDDO

HERE'S THE ORIGINALS
YOUR DAD KNOWS YOUR REDDIN HANDLE
THAT'S THE COVER OF THE HOBBIT THAT TZOLKIN HATED I GUESS IT'S SORT OF A VINTAGE FAN THING NOW THOUGH
THAT'S AWESOME I KNOW THAT TZOLKIN DIDN'T LIKE THOSE COVERS I KNOW THEY DON'T REALLY SHOW ANYTHING IN THE BOOK I DON'T CARE THEY CAUGHT MY IMAGINATION WHEN I WAS A KID AND I LOVE THEM
YOUR DAD IS A REAL ARTIST BRAVO
I HAD THOSE BOOKS THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY TZOLKIN ART YOU COULD FIND IN THOSE DAYS AND THEY WEREN'T VERY AT ALL STILL EXCELLENT NOSTALGIA AND EXCELLENT MURAL
HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED THE KEYBOARD IS IT FOR SCHOOL OR WORK
MY BELIEF IS THAT NO ONE SHOULD EVERY BUY DISPLAY SWORDS EVER FOR ANY REASON YOU CAN JUST GO AN LOOK AT SWORDS IN SWORD STORES AS OFTEN AS YOU GO PAST THEM THAT SHOULD BE PLENTY TO MAKE YOU HAPPY DO YOU REALLY NEED IT ON YOUR WALL

BUT HEY MAYBE YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY

IF YOU DON'T POST AN UPDATE WE RIOT
I WOULD HAVE EATEN THE AND GIVEN THEM TO HER FOR FREE
I'M WATCHING THE EXTENDED EDITION DVD OF THE FELLOWSHIP RIGHT NOW AND I JUST GOT TO THE SCENE WHERE GANDALF SAYS THAT THIS POST AND IT BLEW MY MIND
GREAT STORY MAYBE THIS SHOULD CONSIDER A KIND OF DONATE A COPY OF LOAR EFFORT LIKE THE MOVEMENT TO PUT BIBLES INTO MOTELS
I WAS ABOUT HER AGE WHEN I BORROWED A VHS THAT'S RIGHT OF FELLOWSHIP FROM A FRIEND I WATCHED IT EVERY DAY UNTIL I HAD TO RETURN IT
IF YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE MONEY AND REALLY WANTED HER TO SEE IT TO THE POINT OF PRACTICALLY BEGGING HER FOR HOURS WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GIVE IT TO HER FOR FREE
HOW CAN SOMEONE LIKES WIZARDS ELVES AND MAGIC BUT NEVER HEARD OF LOAR HAHA I FEEL LIKE IF I GOOGLED THOSE WORDS LOAR WOULD BE THE FIRST RESULT
YEAH WHY DIDN'T YOU GIFT THEM TO HER
I MEAN IF YOU REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO SELL THEM JUST GIVEN THEM
REMINDME
BOOK MOVIE
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE GO TO A USED BOOKS STORE BUY HER A COPY OF THE HOBBIT AND THE LOAR TRILOGY AND BRING THEM TO HERALDRY IT'S NOW YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE SHE KNOWS ABOUT TOM BOBADIL
FUCKING BOOTLEGS MAN
SWORD NOT INCLUDED
LITTLE SAURONNY HAS ONE HELL OF A PARTY AHEAD OF HIM
LIT
R CRAPPYOFFBRANDS
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT'S JUST A GENERIC NON COPYRIGHTED DARK CRUSADER
I'D DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SET ANNIVERSARY EDITION I HAVE IT MYSELF AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER ABOUT IT

ALL THREE BOOKS ARE SEPARATED SO IT'S NOT A HUGE BRICK YOU HAVE TO HOLD WHEN READING AND AS A HUGE BONUS WITH THIS EDITION THE READERS COMPANION
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SET IF YOU CAN FIND IT

GP AW D REF IE DTF QID SR PI KEYWORDS LOAR ALAN LEE SET APPL DID REF LARCH

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL HARDCOVER EDITION SET WITH AMAZING PAINTINGS BY ALAN LEE THEY AREA LITTLE BIGGER BUT VERY NICE TO READ THERE IS ALSO A MATCHING HOBBIT AND SILMARILLION BOOK THAT ARE SAME SIZE AND FILLED WITH PAINTINGS

HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
THIS IS THE VERSION THAT I HAVE AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT IT HAS ALL THE BOOKS IN ONE VOLUME AND COMES WITH BEAUTIFUL MAPS INSIDE THE FRONT AND BACK COVERS IT'S VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH IT

BECAUSE IT IS AN ALL IN ONE BOOK IT IS VERY LARGE AND VERY HEAVY NOT REALLY SOMETHING THAT I LIKE TO CARRY AROUND WITH ME I HAVE A SET OF THE INDIVIDUAL VOLUMES FOR WHEN I AM TRAVELING OR GOING TO READ IN THE WOODS OR REALLY ANYTIME I AM NOT IN MY HOUSE I'M LOOKING TO GET THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION FOR THIS SPECIFIC REASON AND IT WILL COMPLIMENT MY VERY WELL IN THE END IT COMES DOWN TO PERSONAL PREFERENCE THOUGH
I'M A BIG FAN OF THE HARPER COLLINS SOFT-COVER OMNIBUS WITH JOHN ILLUSTRATION OF GANDALF ON IT MINE SAYS IT'S FROM PRINTED IN GLASGOW
SO LOOKED UP THE WRITER OF THE REVIEW AND THIS JUST BECAME A LOT MORE INTERESTING

MICHAEL WHITNEY STRAIGHT WAS AN AMERICAN MAGAZINE PUBLISHER NOVELIST PATRON OF THE ARTS A MEMBER OF THE PROMINENT WHITNEY FAMILY AND A CONFESSED SPY FOR THE KGB
SORT OF INTERESTING HOW THEY REFER TO THE RED BOOK AS THOUGH IT WERE REAL AND NOT A WAY TO FRAME THE STORY
WELL I'M GLAD I DIDN'T ENCOUNTER THIS REVIEW BEFORE READING THE BOOKS BECAUSE IT BASICALLY RETELLS THE WHOLE PLOT
TOL ERESSËA NOT QUITE ALIENOR ADAMIK
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A STUPID ANSWER BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS A METAPHOR FOR THE AFTERLIFE
UM HAVE YOU SEEN OR READ THE SERIES

HE GOES WITH THE ELVES IN THE BOATS TO ALIENOR
YES HE WAS THERE WITH THEM IN THE BOOK FRODO WAS THE ONE WHO CAUSED THE NAGUAL THAT CAME TO FLEE AFTER HE WAS STABBED BY CALLING UPON THE QUEEN OF THE ALAR
HE WAS RIGHT THERE BUT IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY FRODO HAD PUT ON THE RING SO ARAGON WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE HIM
IT SAYS THAT STRIDER WENT AT THEM WITH A FIRE STICK IN EACH ARM AS THEY APPROACHED FRODO DOESN'T ELABORATE THOUGH
DEFINITELY HAND-SEWN BUT THAT'S NOT THORIN
ACCORDING TO VARIOUS WRITINGS OF PUBLISHED IN THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH WHEN ELVES DIE THEIR SPIRITS GO THE HALLS OF BANDOS IN ALIENOR FROM WHICH AFTER A PERIOD OF REFLECTION OR PURGATORY THEY ARE USUALLY REEMBODIED BY THE ALAR THIS IS NOTHING UNUSUAL THE UNUSUAL THING ABOUT GLORFINDEL IS THAT HE RETURNED TO MIDDLE-EARTH AFTER HIS RESURRECTION INSTEAD OF REMAINING IN ALIENOR IN VOLUME OF HOME TZOLKIN DISCUSSES RETURN AND SUGGESTS THAT HE CAME BACK DURING THE SECOND AGE TO HELP ELROD AND IN THE WAR AGAINST SARON
IT IS ASSUMED THAT THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME IN TWO VERSIONS OF RETURN GIVEN IN LAST WRITINGS THE ONE IS THAT HE CAME WITH GANDALF AROUND TENSE A POSSIBLY AS ONE OF A SMALL PARTY MORE PROBABLY AS A SOLE COMPANION LANDED WITH ABOUT THIRD AGE LAST WRITINGS GLORFINDEL AND THE OTHER WAS THAT HE ARRIVED IN THE 2ND AGE ON A NÚMENÓREAN VESSEL

ELVISH RESURRECTION IS NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL BECAUSE ELVES ARE BOUND TO ARDA IT IS SAID THAT THE ELDAR SAY THAT MORE THAN ONE IS SELDOM RECORDED MANY DOUBTLESS THAT HAVE TWICE DIED DO NOT WISH TO RETURN LAWS AND CUSTOMS AMONG THE ELDAR FROM THIS THERE ARE EVEN OCCURRENCES OF MULTIPLE REBIRTHS IN THE SILMARILLION AFTER FIBROID FELAGUND DIES IT IS SAID

FIBROID WALKS WITH FINARFIN HIS FATHER BENEATH THE TREES IN VLADAMAR OF BEDEN AND LÚTHIEN

MARIEL THERINDË IS REBORN AFTER HER HUSBAND FINEW AGREES TO NOT COME BACK THIS IS DUE TO HER FORMER DECISION TO NEVER RETURN WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE SEVERANCE OF THEIR MARRIAGE AND MARRIAGE TO BINDIS

IN THE 2ND VERSION GLORFINDEL IS SAID TO HAVE RETURNED TO MIDDLE-EARTH IN THE CRISIS OF THE SECOND AGE WHEN SARON INVADED ERIADOR TO ASSIST ELROD AND THAT THOUGH NOT YET MENTIONED IN THE ANNALS RECORDING DEFEAT HE PLAYED A NOTABLE AND HEROIC PART IN THE WAR LAST WRITINGS GLORFINDEL IT IS FURTHER STATED ABOUT THIS SOUTH A RETURN

THIS MUST PROBABLY HAVE OCCURRED BEFORE THE END OF THE SECOND AGE AND THE CHANGE OF THE WORLD AND THE DROWNING OF NÚMENOR AFTER WHICH NO LIVING EMBODIED CREATURE HUMANE OR OF LESSER KINDS COULD RETURN FROM THE BLESSED REALM WHICH HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CIRCLES OF THE WORLD HIS RETURN MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF STRENGTHENING AND ELROD WHEN THE GROWING EVIL OF THE INTENTIONS OF SARON WERE AT LAST PERCEIVED BY THEM IT MIGHT THEREFORE HAVE BEEN AS EARLY AS SECOND AGE WHEN SARON CAME IN PERSON TO LINDON AND ATTEMPTED TO DECEIVE BUT WAS REJECTED AND DISMISSED BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN PERHAPS MORE PROBABLY AS LATE AS COUNTY THE YEAR OF DREAD LAST WRITINGS GLORFINDEL
I WONDER WHY THE KINSLAYING WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL THEN WHEN THEY WERE GETTING RESURRECTED A DIME A DOZEN JUST A TOSS AWAY
NORTHLANDER HERE HOW IN DEPTH ARE WE GONNA BE GOING WITH THE TRIVIA I DON'T WANNA SHOW UP AND GET ABSOLUTELY RECT GREAT IDEA THOUGH LET ME KNOW
BOOK IV FOLLOWS FRODO AND IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL BOOK III FOLLOWS THE REST OF THE SURVIVING MEMBERS OF THE FELLOWSHIP THERE'S NO REASON I CAN THINK OF THAT YOU CAN'T READ THEM OUT OF ORDER IF YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIES YOU KNOW GENERALLY WHAT HAPPENS ANYWAY

THIS REASONING DOES NOT APPLY TO RETURN OF THE KING I SHOULD MENTION
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON PERSONAL TASTE BUT I MASSIVELY PREFER BOOK TO BOOK JERT MENTIONS IN THE FOREWORD HOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE PREFERRED DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BOOK

BOOK IS THE STORY OF ARAGON GOING TO ROHAN AND THE STUFF WITH THRODDEN AND SAURURAN AND GANDALF RETURNING BOOK IS MOSTLY FRODO AND SAM AND GOLLUM AND OF COURSE FARAMIR
I ACTUALLY READ BEFORE REALLY DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
BOOK IV COVERS MORE TIME THAN BOOK III BOOK III ENDS RIGHT AROUND THE TIME CHAPTER OF BOOK IV STARTS

I HAVE DEVISED FOR MYSELF A COMPLEX CHRONOLOGICAL READING SYSTEM BUT I'M UNEASY RECOMMENDING IT GOR FIRST TIME READERS

HERE'S MY READING SUGGESTION TO HELP BREAK THINGS UP

CHAPTERS OF BOOK III

BOOK IV CHAPTER

BOOK III CHAPTER THIS IS A LONG ONE SO IF IT HELPS STOP HALFWAY THROUGH LIKE BEFORE THE ENTMOOT

BOOK III CHAPTERS

BOOK IV CHAPTER 2

REST OF BOOK III CHAPTER

BOOK III CHAPTERS

BOOK IV CHAPTER

BOOK III CHAPTER

THEN THE REST OF BOOK IV
THEY ARE CORRUPTED IT IS ONLY THAT THE COULDN'T COMPLETELY OVERTHROW A WILL NOR TURN HIM INTO A WRAITH BUT THEY CERTAINLY CAUSED MASSIVE IN THEIR BEARERS WHICH CAUSED THEM TO DO ALL SORTS OF IRRATIONAL THINGS

THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT THE ONE WOULD HAVE DONE HOWEVER SINCE IT WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE
READING THROUGH THESE THREADS IT ALWAYS AMAZES ME HOW UNDER APPRECIATED HOBBITS ARE REGARDED GANDALF EXPLAINS IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING THE TENACITY OF HOBBITS TO WITHSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF THE RING IN ADDITION TO THEIR ABILITY TO SEEMINGLY DISAPPEAR FROM PLAIN SIGHT PEOPLE ALWAYS WONDER ABOUT WHY THEY CHOSE SUCH AN IMPOSSIBLE METHOD FOR GETTING THE RING TO MOUNT DOOM BUT I BELIEVE GANDALF KNEW ALL ALONG THAT THE BEST BET WOULD BE TO RELY ON THE CUNNINGNESS BRAVERY AND DETERMINATION OF FRODO NOT TO MENTION HE WAS IN FACT ABLE TO SNEAK THROUGH MORODOR WITHOUT NOTICE SO IN REGARDS TO YOUR POST I BELIEVE THAT GANDALF INFLUENCED THE COUNCIL AT RIVENDELL NOT TO GIVE IT TO GIMLI OR ANY OF THE OTHER SEEMINGLY MORE CAPABLE MEMBERS OF THE FELLOWSHIP BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THE FATE OF THE RING WAS TIED TO FRODO AND WAS WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD IT IN HIM
WHILST THE ONE RING STILL EXISTED NONE OF THE OTHER RINGS OF POWER WERE SAFE INCLUDING THE THAT BELONGED TO THE DWARVES

YES THE DWARVES WERE EFFECTED BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE ONE RING A GOOD EXAMPLE IS GRANDFATHER THEOR AND FATHER THRAIN

YOU CAN FIND THE FOLLOWING DETAILS IN THE PAGES FOLLOWING THE RETURN OF THE KING AS CHRONOLOGICAL NOTES I THINK

FOLLOWING COMING THEOR THRAIN AND THORIN ESCAPE THE LONELY MOUNTAIN THEOR GIVES THRAIN HIS RING OF POWER AND TRAVELS EAST TO MORIA

ON REACHING MORIA HE PROCEEDS TO ENTER IT WITH NO WEAPONS OR ARMOUR THINKING HE WOULD BE MADE WELCOME DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CITY HAD GONE SILENT FOR A LONG TIME AND ALL THIS DESPITE THE MISGIVINGS OF HIS TRAVELING COMPANION

THEOR GETS KILLED BY AGOG AND WHAT FOLLOWS IS THE BATTLE OF DIMRILL DALE A CONFLICT THAT SAW HEAVY CASUALTIES ON BOTH SIDES AND WAS A PYRRHIC VICTORY FOR THE DWARVES

2 YEARS LATER THRAIN WITH HIS RING OF POWER WANDERS ALONE IN THE DIRECTION OF DOL GOULDER GETS TORTURED AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED HIS RING IS SENT SOUTH TO MORDOR


GANDALF WAS THEIR INTERVENTION
NO THEY WOULDN'T

PRESUMABLY THEY COULD OF COURSE THEY TOOK ON CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THAT IN THE FIRST AGE WITH BELERIAND IN EVEN WORSE SHAPE AT THE TIME TOO AND WON BUT FROM THE THIRD AGE ON MIDDLE EARTH WASN'T THEIR DIRECT PROBLEM ANYMORE

KIND OF IRRESPONSIBLE OF THEM IN A WAY THEY HAD SARON CAPTURED AFTER THE WAR OF WRATH AND LET HIM GET AWAY
SARON WOULD NEVER BE TOO POWERFUL FOR THE ALAR TO DEFEAT A LONE MAIA CANNOT COMPETE WITH THE POWER OF A SINGLE VALA LET ALONE ALL OF THEM

WOULD THE POWERS ACTUALLY COME TO MIDDLE-EARTH TO FIGHT ONE OF THEIR FALLEN SERVANTS ABSOLUTELY NOT FANWE WILL NOT COME DOWN FROM THE WHITE MOUNTAIN UNTIL THE LAST DAY

IF THE ALAR WOULD DEIGN TO AID MIDDLE-EARTH AGAIN IT WOULD BE BY SENDING SOME OF THEIR SERVANTS TO THAT LAND AS THEY DID IN THE WAR OF WRATH BUT IT WOULD TAKE A GREAT PLEA FROM A VALUED VOICE TO SWAY THEIR HEARTS

IF SARON WAS COMPLETELY VICTORIOUS AND GANDALF THE WHITE WAS SLAIN THE SPIRIT OF COLORIN MIGHT RETURN TO THE WEST AND SPEAK TO THE ALAR IN THE RING OF DOOM

THERE IN THE MAHANAXAR COLORIN MIGHT PERSUADE THE POWERS TO AID AN EMBATTLED MIDDLE-EARTH AGAINST THE DEPREDATIONS OF THE DARK LORD

IF FANWE AND THE OTHERS DID ACCEDED TO REQUEST THEIR RESPONSE WOULD NO DOUBT BE THE SAME AS THE WAR OF WRATH

TEN THOUSAND PANYAR AND NOLUDAR ELVES WOULD SET SAIL FROM ALIENOR BACK TO MIDDLE-EARTH LED BY THE MIGHTY MAIA EBONEE THE ELVES WOULD EASILY SLAY THE EASTERLING HARADRIM AND ORCS THAT SERVED SARON WITH EMBODIED ELVES SUCH AS FINGOLFIN FINDON TURGOR ECTHELION AND MANY OTHER MIGHTY WARRIORS THE THRALLS OF SARON WOULD FALL LIKE RIPE WHEAT BEFORE THE SCYTHE

EVEN THE NAGUAL WOULD BE DESTROYED IF NOT BY THE ELVES THEN MOST DEFINITELY BY THE POWER OF THE MAAR THAT ACCOMPANIED THE HOST OF THE ALAR

EBONEE AND HIS COMRADES WOULD SHATTER THE VERY MOUNTAINS ASH AND SHADOW BREAKING MORDOR OPEN WITH EXTREME FORCE ONCE INSIDE THEY WOULD HEAD STRAIGHT FOR AND WITH THE MIGHT THEY POSSESSED THEY WOULD KNOCK THE DARK TOWER DOWN

WHETHER SARON CAME FORTH OR NOT WOULD BE IRRELEVANT IN THE FACE OF SUCH DIVINE MIGHT IF SARON DID COME FORTH TO FACE HIS ENEMIES RING OR NO RING HE WOULD BE DEFEATED EBONEE WOULD PERSONALLY HEW HIS LEGS OFF AS HE DID WITH MASTER IN THE FIRST AGE

THE MAAR WOULD BIND SARON WITH GAINOR AND DRAG HIM BACK TO ALIENOR BOUND AND GAGGED WHERE THE ALAR WOULD THRUST HIM THROUGH THE DOOR OF NIGHT TO JOIN HIS MASTER IN THE VOID

OF COURSE IT WOULD TAKE A VERY IMPASSIONED PLEA TO GET THE ALAR TO INTERVENE AGAIN AND IF THEY DID ALL OF MORDOR WOULD BE COMPLETELY DESTROYED AND THE SEA WOULD FLOW INTO THE BLACK LAND CHANGING THE SHAPE OF MIDDLE-EARTH AGAIN MOST OF CONDOR WOULD PROBABLY BE DROWNED AS WELL AND THE MEN OF THE WEST WOULD HAVE TO REBUILD IN ERIADOR

THE ALAR WOULD ONLY INTERVENE IF THERE WAS NO HOPE LEFT FOR ANYONE ELSE TO STOP SARON BUT IF THEY DID INTERVENE DIRECTLY SARON WOULD HAVE NO CHANCE AT ALL
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF MIDDLE EARTH FELL AND THERE WERE NO MEN OR ELVES OR HOBBITS TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE GANDALF

WELL AFTER THE ATROCITY FEASOR AND THE NOLUDAR COMMITTED THE ALAR RESOLVED TO NEVER INTERVENE DIRECTLY SO IF GANDALF FAILS THERE'D BE NO HELP FOR MIDDLE EARTH FROM THEIR SIDE

WOULD THEY ACT IF SARON TRIED TO INVADE THE UNDYING LANDS

WELL FIRST OFF I DON'T SEE SARON GETTING PAST THE SEA SPIRIT OSSE

SECONDLY EVEN IF SARON AND HIS ARMIES MAKE LANDFALL IN THE UNDYING LANDS I CAN'T SEE TALUKAS DOING NOTHING HE'LL PROBABLY DESTROY EVERYTHING SARON CAN THROW AT HIM WHILST LAUGHING THAT IS
THEY WOULD

THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT INTERVENING DIRECTLY WAS JUST BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CAUSE DESTRUCTION ON THE LAND BUT THEY WOULD ALWAYS GIVE UP ON THIS PRINCIPLE AT THE UTMOST END OF NEED

LET'S REMEMBER MELIOR THE ALAR USED TO FIGHT WITH HIM ALL THE TIME AND IT ALWAYS ENDED UP WRECKING SHIT SO THEY FINALLY DECIDED TO STAY IN THE UNDYING LANDS AND LET THE MATTER OF RESISTING MELIOR OR JOINING HIM REST IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE OF MIDDLE-EARTH WELL THEY TRIED BUT WERE UNABLE TO RESIST MELIOR WHO CONQUERED EVERYTHING EARENDIL A MORTAL WAS PERMITTED TO SAIL TO ALIENOR AND TELL FANWE THAT THE FIGHT WAS NOW OFFICIALLY HOPELESS AND EVERYONE WAS ENSLAVED SO THEY TURNED BACK ON THEIR DECISION NOT TO FIGHT IN MIDDLE-EARTH THEY SMACKED DOWN ARMIES AND FORTRESSES DESTROYING BELERIAND IN THE WAR OF WRATH

NOW IN THE THIRD AGE IF SARON CONQUERED EVERYTHING IN MIDDLE-EARTH COLORIN WOULD SAIL BACK WEST AND SAY THE PEOPLE WANT TO BE FREE OF SARON BUT EVERYONE'S BEEN ENSLAVED THE STAKES HAVING BEEN RAISED HIGHER THAN THE COST OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT WOULD BEFALL MIDDLE-EARTH WITH THE INVASION OF THE HOST OF THE ALAR THE ALAR WOULD BE MOVED INTO ACTION BY HIS PLEA OVERTHROW SARON AND PROBABLY TEAR UP THAT BEAUTIFUL SHIRE COUNTRYSIDE
READ CALMLY AND SLOWLY THERE'S A LOT REALLY A LOT OF INFORMATION IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER AND FOLLOW ALL NAMES
I JUST BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY AND THE CASHIER GOES AH SO YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO READ ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT BOOKS OF ALL TIME HIS ADVICE TAKE YOUR TIME AND TRY TO APPRECIATE IT
THE ATLAS OF MIDDLE EARTH IS A GREAT COMPANION BOOK TO THE SILMARILLION IT REALLY HELPED ME KEEP TRACK OF NAMES AND PLACES
THERE ARE TWO CHAPTERS IN PARTICULAR THAT ARE EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL TO GET THROUGH BUT AS LONG AS YOU ARE PATIENT AND DONT GIVE UP ON IT THE BOOK IS VERY MUCH WORTH IT
READ SLOW USE A BOOKMARK DON'T EXPECT TO DO ANY SPEED READING THERE'S A LIST OF NAMES IN THE BACK IF YOU FORGET SOMEONE BUT THESE OFTEN CONTAIN SPOILERS SO BEWARE OF THAT IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER SOMEONE I RECOMMEND LOOKING THEM UP AND THEN WRITING DOWN WHO THEY ARE SOMEWHERE I ALWAYS FORGOT THE SAME PEOPLE SO HAVING AN EXPLANATORY BOOKMARK REALLY HELPED ME STAY ON TRACK

DON'T TAKE LONG BREAKS FROM READING I READ A LITTLE EVERY DAY UNTIL I WAS DONE IT'S VERY DENSE AND EASY TO LOSE THE PLOT IN SOME PLACES
IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE READING AT ALL OR BECOME FRUSTRATED WITH THE STYLE SEARCH FOR THE AUDIOBOOK ON YOUTUBE BY MARTIN SHAW I READ THE BOOKS TWO TIMES BUT IT ALL DIDN'T REALLY COME TOGETHER COMPLETELY UNTIL I LISTENED TO THE AUDIOBOOK NOW I READ IT ANNUALLY THE AUDIOBOOK REALLY HELPED WITH THE PACING PRONUNCIATION AND STYLE IT IS WRITTEN
MANY CHARACTERS AND PLACES HAVE MULTIPLE NAMES EITHER IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES OR BECAUSE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE DON'T LET THIS HINDER YOU AND IN FACT IT MAKES THE BOOK SO MUCH RICHER ON SECOND AND SUBSEQUENT READINGS AS YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER DO HAVE FUN FINDING CHARACTERS REFERRED TO IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS OR ARE EVEN THE SAME ELVES FROM YEARS BEFORE LOAR IT IS BOTH EPIC AND SUBLIME AND WORTH THE ATTENTION

IF YOU HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH THE NAMES AND THE SYNTAX OF SENTENCES I ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE AUDIO VERSION READ BY MARTIN SHAW HE DOES A VERY GOOD JOB VERBALIZING THE MATERIAL WHICH ON A CERTAIN LEVEL WAS MEANT TO BE READ ALOUD
I ALWAYS WROTE DOWN A CHARACTER'S NAME AND A LITTLE ABOUT THEM WHEN THEY WERE FIRST INTRODUCED AND ADDED TO THEIR ENTRY WHEN THEY RESURFACED IF EVER

I ALSO MADE VERY LIMITED FAMILY TREES AND MY OWN CHART FOR ALL THE GROUPS OF DIVES THERE ARE A LOT
KEEP A BOOKMARK ON THE INDEX AND FAMILY TREES KEEP A MAP OF BELERIAND HANDY AND REFER TO THEM WHEN CONFUSED DON'T READ TOO MANY CHAPTERS IN ONE SITTING AND BE WILLING TO REREAD THE BOOK SEVERAL MORE TIMES TO APPRECIATE IT TO ITS FULL EFFECT
IF YOU DON'T MIND SPENDING A HOUR OR TWO OF LISTENING BETWEEN EACH CHAPTER THE DONATION SILMARILLION SEMINAR IS A GREAT COMPANION

DON'T STRESS ABOUT ALL THE NAMES YOU'LL GET TONS OF THEM AND THINK OH GOD HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER ALL THESE THE SECRET YOU DON'T NEED TO EVERY TIME LONG LISTS OF NAMES ARE MENTIONED ONLY ABOUT HALF WILL COME BACK

IF YOU DON'T MIND BEING A LITTLE BUT STUDIOUS TAKE NOTES FOR EVERY BOOK I'VE EVER READ WITH A TON OF CHARACTERS I'VE KEPT A SMALL NOTEBOOK I WRITE DOWN CHARACTER NAMES AND INFORMATION AS THEY'RE INTRODUCED LEAVING PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ADDITIONAL NOTES AS THINGS DEVELOP

THE FIRST TIME THROUGH YOU CAN REALLY JUST SKIM THE CHAPTER OF BELARIAND AND IT'S REALMS IT'S AN INTERESTING CHAPTER AND IT'S REALLY TZOLKIN LETTING HIS NERD BANNER FLY BUT IT CAN BE CAN BORING IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR STORY OR DON'T LISTS OF MAPS AND NAMES

STUDY THE PRONUNCIATION GUIDE IN THE BACK TZOLKIN KNEW EXACTLY HOW ALL THESE NAMES SHOULD BE PRONOUNCED AND CREATED CONSISTENT RULES FOR DOING SO IT'S SATISFYING TO SAY THEM ALL CORRECTLY IN A SIMILAR VEIN THE GLOSSARY THAT GIVES YOU THE TRANSLATIONS OF ELVISH WORDS IS FUN YOU CAN USE IT TO DECIPHER THE MEANINGS OF THE NAMES OF CHARACTERS PLACES AND EVENTS

IF SOME THINGS SEEM TO BE REPEATED OR DISJOINTED KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS WAS A LIFE SPANNING WORK FOR TZOLKIN THAT WAS NEVER ASSEMBLED OR TRULY COMPLETED IN HIS LIFETIME

IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS EVER HAVE FUN
GOOD LUCK LOVED MY 1ST READ IT'S MY GO TO TOILET BOOK NOW
READ ALOUD WHEN YOU CAN ALSO KNOW THAT EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK HAS LIKE THREE NAMES DON'T GET OVERLY CONCERNED WITH KNOWING ALL OF THEM JUST TRY TO LOOSELY KEEP IMPORTANT ONES STRAIGHT AND LOTS OF NAMES START WITH F AND THAT CAN GET CONFUSING

OH AND HAVING A MAP HANDY CAN HELP AND BE ADVISED THERE'S A CHAPTER WHERE LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENS IT'S JUST DESCRIPTION WHEN I READ IT ALOUD TO MY SISTER I SKIPPED IT

SOMETIMES THE NARRATIVE GOES BACK AND COVERS THINGS IT ALREADY GLOSSED OVER LIKE THE BIBLE DOES
TIPS FOR READING A BOOK
START AT PAGE

I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANT IT'S A BOOK A VERY GOOD BOOK READ IT
SKIP THE CREATION CHAPTERS AT THE START YOU CAN ALWAYS COME BACK TO THOSE IF YOU WANT TO BUT THEY ARE PRETTY SPECIALIZED INTERESTS THE BOOK IS NOT A NOVEL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ IT LIKE ONE

THE GIANTS ARE ACTUALLY NOT STORM GIANTS AND ACCORDING TO THE HOBBIT THEY ARE THROWING BOULDERS FOR THE FUN OF IT HERE'S THE RELEVANT PASSAGE
BILBO HAD NEVER SEEN OR IMAGINED ANYTHING OF THE KIND THEY WERE HIGH UP IN A NARROW PLACE WITH A DREADFUL FALL INTO A DIM VALLEY AT ONE SIDE OF THEM THERE THEY WERE SHELTERING UNDER A HANGING ROCK FOR THE NIGHT AND HE LAY BENEATH A BLANKET AND SHOOK FROM HEAD TO TOE WHEN HE PEEPED OUT IN THE HE SAW THAT ACROSS THE VALLEY THE WERE OUT AND WERE HURLING ROCKS AT ONE ANOTHER FOR A GAME AND CATCHING THEM AND TOSSING THEM DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS WHERE THEY SMASHED AMONG THE TREES FAR BELOW OR SPLINTERED INTO LITTLE BITS WITH A BANG THEN CAME A WIND AND A RAIN AND THE WIND WHIPPED THE RAIN AND THE HAIL ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION SO THAT AN OVERHANGING ROCK WAS NO PROTECTION AT ALL SOON THEY WERE GETTING DRENCHED AND THEIR PONIES WERE STANDING WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN AND THEIR TAILS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS AND SOME OF THEM WERE WHINNYING WITH FRIGHT THEY COULD HEAR THE GIANTS GUFFAWING AND SHOUTING ALL OVER THE MOUNTAINSIDES
THIS WON T DO AT ALL SAID THORIN IF WE DON T GET BLOWN OFF OR DROWNED OR STRUCK BY LIGHTNING WE SHALL BE PICKED UP BY SOME GIANT AND KICKED SKY-HIGH FOR A FOOTBALL

THEIR BACKSTORY IS NOT REALLY KNOWN THE GIANTS ARE ACTUALLY A RECURRING POINT OF DISCUSSION IN TZOLKIN LORE SINCE THEY ARE MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE HOBBIT BUT NEVER AS ACTUAL EXISTING CREATURES IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS OR THE SILMARILLION
THERE WERE GIANTS IN EARLIER WRITINGS SEE THE BOOK OF LOST TALES BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE DROPPED THEM FROM THE LEGENDARIUM LATER ON ONE STANCE IS THAT THE GIANTS MENTIONED IN THE HOBBIT ARE SIMPLY REMNANTS OF THOSE EARLIER WRITINGS AND SHOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED CANONICAL FOR GREATER WORLD IT'S A POINT OF CONTENTION THOUGH

AS FOR THE AS MENTIONED IN THE HOBBIT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION TO GO ON APART FROM THE PASSAGE ABOVE THERE'S REALLY ONLY TWO INTERESTING BITS IN THERE

GANDALF EXPLAINS OF BEHORN THAT
SOME SAY THAT HE IS A BEAR DESCENDED FROM THE GREAT AND ANCIENT BEARS OF THE MOUNTAINS THAT LIVED THERE BEFORE THE GIANTS CAME

SO APPARENTLY THE GIANTS DROVE OUT THE BEARS WHEN THEY CAME BUT FROM WHERE OR WHEN IS NOT ELABORATED

GANDALF ALSO CONSIDERS WHETHER HE CAN T FIND A MORE OR LESS DECENT GIANT TO BLOCK A THIS IMPLIES THAT THE GIANTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY EVIL AND CAN BE TALKED TO REASONED WITH AND MAY EVEN RENDER HELP IF ASKED
HOWEVER SINCE GANDALF DOESN'T ACTUALLY TALK TO A GIANT THIS IS NOT CORROBORATED IN THE STORY
IT'S THE ONION I KNOW BUT IT RINGS TRUE I REMEMBER WATCHING THAT EXACT MOMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS AND IT WAS A GUT PUNCH

NOOOOOO FRODO SPEAKING FOR US ALL
ON THE COUCH IN THE BASEMENT SUMMER BETWEEN 5TH AND 6TH GRADE I DON'T REMEMBER THAT EXACT MOMENT TO MY DEEP REGRET BUT I STARTED READING FELLOWSHIP MIDMORNING AND NEXT THING I KNEW MOM WAS TELLING ME THAT DINNER WAS READY THE FELLOWSHIP WAS LEAVING LOTHLORIEN I WAS STARVING AND REALLY HAD TO PEE
I WAS MORE DEVASTATED THAN WHEN MERLIN BLEW HIMSELF TO BERMUDA
FAVORITE PART ARAGON STUMBLING AS HE GOES UP THE STEPS FOR ONCE HE WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD UNMANNED DEVASTATED
YEAH I REMEMBER THIS WAS BEFORE THE MOVIES I READ THAT CHAPTER AND WAS LIKE MAN FUCK THIS BOOK DIDN'T PICK THAT SHIT UP AGAIN FOR A WEEK HOWEVER I HAVE TO SAY SPOILER ALERT I WAS SO FUCKING HAPPY WHEN GANDALF RETURNED WHAT AN EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER WHEN DUMBLEDORE DIED I WAS HOPING FOR THE SAME YEAH FUCK THAT BOOK TOO
6TH GRADE ENGLISH CLASSICAL TOWARDS THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WE'D FINISHED WORK SO I WAS READING IN CLASSICAL
WHERE WERE YU WEN GANDALF FELL

I WAS ON COUCH DRINKING DWARF FLUID WHEN FRODO RINGS

GANDALF IS FELL

NO

AND YU

I WAS IN A BAR IN BREE WHEN I READ IT IN THE NEWSPAPER A HORRIBLE DAY
AS A KID ALTHOUGH I MOST LIKELY SAW IT AFTER THE END OF THE TRILOGY BECAUSE I HAD NO COHERENT IDEA OF THE ORDER OF THE MOVIES

OOPS
I WANT TO KNOW IF ELROD KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BEFOREHAND AND IF THAT DAMN WAS EVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SENDING HIM ON THIS MISSION

THIS IS GREAT WHEN I READ THE BOOKS THE FIRST TIME AS A YEAR OLD I THOUGHT THEY WERE LITERALLY FLYING WHEN GANDALF SAYS THAT
ALSO I THINK THE LAST LINE OF THIS SCENE IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS

THEN SHE FELL ON HER KNEES SAYING I BEG THEE
NAY LADY HE SAID AND TAKING HER BY THE HAND HE RAISED
HERALDRY THEN HE KISSED HER HAND AND SPRANG INTO THE SADDLE

I'LL BET THEY LEGIT FELT SORRY FOR HIM CAUSE THEY KNEW THAT WAS A PAINFUL ENCOUNTER FOR HIM
IN THE BIBLE NAHUM THEY WERE PROBABLY TOO DEEP INTO THEIR FANGORN VS GLITTERING CAVES DEBATE TO NOTICE

ALSO I THINK BY THAT POINT THEY HAD A REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHO ARAGON WAS AND THEIR RESPECT FOR HIM WAS UNWAVERING
THE ALREADY OWNED BAG END FRODO SELLS IT TO LOBELIA AND CLOTHO BEFORE HE SETS OUT IN FELLOWSHIP

WHEN THEY COME BACK TO THE SHIRE CLOTHO HAS BEEN KILLED AND LOBELIA IS REALLY OLD OR SHE JUST LEAVES AT ANY CASE IT SEEMS THAT OWNERSHIP REVERTS BACK TO FRODO

EDIT WHO THEN LEAVES IT TO SAM
SAM INHERITED BAG END BUT IT'S HARD TO SAY WHO INHERITED IT AFTER THAT BECAUSE HIS DAUGHTER ELABOR MARRIED ASTRED OF GREENHELM AND THEY FOUNDED THE SETTLEMENT OF UNDERTOWERS IN THE WESTMARCH

IN ANY CASE THERE AREN'T ANY MORE THEIR LINE WAS WIPED OUT AFTER THE DEATHS OF CLOTHO AND LOBELIA
THE END OF A WAR ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE DISNEY FAIRY TALE HAPPINESS TZOLKIN DID A GREAT JOB MAKING YOU FEEL THAT EMPTINESS AFTER ALL WAS OVER HE WAS IN AND LOST MANY FRIENDS IN THE END ALL YOU HAVE IS LONGING AND SORROW AFTER WAR THERE ARE NO GOOD FEELINGS
AND NOW I FEEL EXTREMELY EMPTY AND DEAD INSIDE

AH YES A TERRIBLE FEELING ENDING A LONG DEEP READ YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM A CONDITION I CALL POST PARTUM LITERATIM I WISH YOU WELL IN YOUR RECOVERY

MY GO TO SUGGESTION FOR FOLLOW UP TO THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS NEAL ANATHEM IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET UP TO SPEED BUT TRUST ME IT IS A DEEPLY ENGAGING NOVEL AND WILL HELP YOU LEAVE MIDDLE-EARTH BEHIND
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DIDN'T LIKE THEM ANYMORE ON THE SECOND READ
THE BOOK MADE ME HAPPY AT THE END BUT A SORT OF MELANCHOLY HAPPINESS THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
AFTER CONNECTING THE DOTS OF WHAT HAPPENED TO DWARF FRIENDS IN LORD OF THE RINGS IT MADE ME SAD
I THOUGHT LOAR THE RETURN OF THE KING FOR WAS PRETTY GREAT
LEGO LOAR FOR WAS ME WAS REALLY COOL SINCE YOU COULD ACTUALLY EXPLORE FROM THE SHIRE THROUGH TO MORDOR AND MOST PLACES IN BETWEEN THE LEGO HOBBIT SERIES HAD ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING TOO
LORD OF THE RINGS CONQUEST MAY NOT BE THE MOST ACCURATE GAME STORY WISE HOWEVER IT'S FUN AS DICKS I STILL PLAY THAT GAME YEARS LATER
SLIGHTLY OBSCURE ONE AND OF COURSE VERY DATED BUT THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING ON PC IT WAS A VERY EARLY GAME AND WAS MADE BEFORE THE MOVIES WHICH IS GREAT AS IT INCLUDES PARTS THAT ARE NOT IN THE MOVIES BOBADIL AND IS FREE TO EXPLORE HOBBITON FEATHERTOP MORIA THE BARROW DOWNS ETC IN ITS OWN WAY IT WAS A GREAT GAME WITH A LOT OF DETAIL AND FITS YOUR QUESTION PERFECTLY IF YOU DON'T MIND GOING A BIT RETRO GAMEPLAY

I'D ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THE THIRD AGE THIS WAS A 2 ERA GAME IN THE STYLE OF OLD FINAL FANTASY GAMES IF THAT FLOATS YOUR BOAT IT'S BASED ON THE MOVIES BUT FOLLOWS A STORY OF SOME CHARACTERS WHOSE JOURNEY PARALLELS AND SOMETIMES CROSSES THOSE OF THE FELLOWSHIP AND IS A GREAT WAY OF EXPLORING ROHAN LOTHLORIEN AND REGIONS IN GENERAL THAT YOU ONLY SEE THE MAIN PARTS OF IN THE MOVIES GAMEPLAY I PLAYED THIS ENDLESSLY
THIS IS WHY I WAS REALLY SAD WHEN THE MERP MOD FOR SKYRIN WAS KILLED BY WB
NEVERTHELESS AND DESPITE THEIR FLAWS I WILL SUGGEST SOME OF THE NEWER GAMES WITH GOOD GRAPHICS SHADOW OF MORDOR AND WAR IN THE NORTHERN
I'M GOING TO PROMOTE BEME II ROTOW BECAUSE I CREATE MODS AND MAPS FOR THE GAME ALTHOUGH TOP DOWN IS PROBABLY NOT YOUR THING
LASTLY WE HAVE LOAR CONQUEST WHICH HAS LOCATIONS ALL AROUND MIDDLE-EARTH AND IS STILL A DECENT QUALITY
I REALIZE MINECRAFT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE BUT THE DETAIL AND SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT IS MILD-BLOWING
REALLY I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY GAME WITH NEARLY AS GOOD A REPRESENTATION OF MIDDLE-EARTH AS A WORLD AS LATRO CERTAINLY NOTHING IN THE SHIRE
MY FAVOURITE LOAR GAME HAS TO BE THE BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH SERIES SADLY THEY ARE RTS GAMES SO THERE ARE NOT MUCH INTERACTION WITH THE ENVIRONMENT BUT THEY ARE STILL GREAT GAMES
ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS THE THIRD AGE RPG AND BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS WAY BEFORE IT'S TIME ON ABOX DOESN'T FOLLOW THE STORY AT ALL BUT MORE OF A BACK STORY GRAPHICS WE'RE TOP NOTCH IT WAS IDEALLY A LOAR VERSION OF FOLIOS
GO OUT AND BUY MEDIEVAL TOTAL WAR II SHOULD BE CHEAP THESE DAYS AND GET THE THIRD AGE MODERN IT'S FANTASTIC
THE FOURTH AGE TOTAL WAR THE DOMINION OF MEN IS A MOD FOR ROME TOTAL WAR IT HAS CUSTOM SETTLEMENTS AND OTHERS ARE BEING ADDED IN ITS CITIES OF MIDDLE-EARTH PACKS THE BEST MOD FOR MIDDLE-EARTH FOR TZOLKIN PURISTS VERY POLISHED OVERHAUL
LOAR CONQUEST
I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR YOU GOT IN LATRO BUT THE ROHAN AND CONDOR ZONES ADDED IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE COMPARED TO THE INITIAL REGIONS SEE MINAS TIGRISH
THE MINECRAFT MC MIDDLE EARTH SERVER LOOKS EPIC IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF PLACES THAT ARENT SHOWN IN THE BOOKS OR MOVIES BUT ARE KNOWN TO EXIST LIKE FOREMOST IP
THERE'S THIS NEW GAME CALLED REAL LIFE IT'S PRETTY GREAT

BUT SERIOUSLY MIDDLE-EARTH WASN'T THAT FANTASTICAL AT ALL COMPARED TO PLACES LIKE TAMRIEL OR SCADRIEL RIEL SEEMS TO BE A POPULAR SUFFIX FOR FANTASY PLACES NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THE MISTY MOUNTAINS CREATED QUITE A LARGE RAIN SHADOW I THINK AND THE CITIES OF COURSE BUT I RECENTLY WENT ON A HIKE IN SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK AND THE WHOLE TIME IT REMINDED ME OF ITHILIEN
THE PERSON WHO MADE ME THE CAKE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LORD OF THE RINGS IT WAS MY FRIENDS MUM AND MY FRIEND WHILE WATCHING HER MAKE THE SWORD THOUGHT IT LOOKED GOOD BROKEN SO TOLD HER TO LEAVE IT THAT WAY IT'S A DETAIL I CAN OVERLOOK AS IT'S ONE OF THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENTS I'VE EVER RECEIVED
WHY IS STING BROKEN OTHER THAN THAT DETAIL IT'S AN AMAZING CAKE
I WOULD STRUGGLE TO EAT THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO AWESOME
THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME
THIS IS AWESOME

I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS EXPECTING A RING SHAPED CAKE WHEN I READ THE DESCRIPTION I MIGHT STEAL THAT IDEA
YEAH I'M LIVING HERE WHILE GOING TO UNIVERSITY AT MMU CHESHIRE
THAT'S ONE SEXY CAKE
SHARE THE CAKE
NEED THIS AS MY BIRTHDAY CAKE THIS YEAR
DELETED
THE ARTIST
WAS TODAY YOUR BIRTHDAY
FUN FACT AS A GIFT JERT RECEIVED A CHALICE INSCRIBED WITH THE BLACK SPEECH UPON THE RING OF POWER HE WOULD ONLY USE IT AS AN ASH TRAY BECAUSE THE INSCRIPTION IS EVIL ITS BECAUSE OF THIS I WILL NOT GET A TATTOO OF THE INSCRIPTION
AWESOME
WE WANTS IT WE NEEDS IT MY PRECIOUS
SIMPLE AND ELEGANT

IS IT JUST THIS ONE OR IS IT A SET OF GLASSES EITHER WAY ITS PRETTY GOOD
THREE QUOTES FROM THE FOR NOVEL

I WISH IT NEED NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN MY TIME SAID FRODO
SO DO I SAID GANDALF AND SO DO ALL WHO LIVE TO SEE SUCH TIMES BUT THAT IS NOT FOR THEM TO DECIDE ALL WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHAT TO DO WITH THE TIME THAT IS GIVEN US

DESERVES IT I DARESAY HE DOES MANY THAT LIVE DESERVE DEATH AND SOME THAT DIE DESERVE LIFE CAN YOU GIVE IT TO THEM THEN DO NOT BE TOO EAGER TO DEAL OUT DEATH IN JUDGEMENT FOR EVEN THE VERY WISE CANNOT SEE ALL ENDS I HAVE NOT MUCH HOPE THAT GOLLUM CAN BE CURED BEFORE HE DIES BUT THERE IS A CHANCE OF IT AND HE IS BOUND UP WITH THE FATE OF THE RING MY HEART TELLS ME THAT HE HAS SOME PART TO PLAY YET FOR GOOD OR ILL BEFORE THE END AND WHEN THAT COMES THE PITY OF BILBO MAY RULE THE FATE OF MANY YOURS NOT LEAST

HE BILBO USED OFTEN TO SAY THERE WAS ONLY ONE ROAD THAT IT WAS LIKE A GREAT RIVER ITS SPRINGS WERE AT EVERY DOORSTEP AND EVERY PATH WAS ITS TRIBUTARY IT'S A DANGEROUS BUSINESS FRODO GOING OUT OF YOUR DOOR HE USED TO SAY YOU STEP INTO THE ROAD AND IF YOU DON'T KEEP YOUR FEET THERE IS NO KNOWING WHERE YOU MIGHT BE SWEPT OFF TO
I DON'T KNOW HALF OF YOU HALF AS WELL AS I SHOULD LIKE BUT I LIKE LESS THAN HALF OF YOU HALF AS WELL AS YOU DESERVE
GANDALF TELLS THEOWMEN TO WALK OUTSIDE WITH HIM AFTER HE'S BEEN HELD UP IN HIS HALLS FOR MANY DAYS FULL OF DOUBT AND SORROW UNDER THE POISONOUS WORDS OF WORM-TONGUED

THEOWMEN IT'S NOT SO DARK OUT HERE
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY IN THE MOVIE WHEN THE FELLOWSHIP LEAVES LOTHLORIEN LADY GALADRIEL SINGS TO THEM IN ELVISH SHE SINGS TO FRODO HER STORY AND WISHES THAT AT LEAST FRODO COULD FIND HIS WAY TO ALIENOR AFTER HIS TASK IS FULFILLED

AH LIKE GOLD FALL THE LEAVES IN THE WIND
LONG YEARS NUMBERLESS AS THE WINGS OF TREES
THE YEARS HAVE PASSED LIKE SWIFT DRAUGHTS
OF THE SWEET MEAD IN LOFTY HALLS BEYOND THE WEST
BENEATH THE BLUE VAULTS OF ARDA
WHEREIN THE STARS TREMBLE IN THE SONG OF HER VOICE HOLY AND QUEENLY

WHO NOW SHALL REFILL THE CUP FOR ME

FOR NOW THE KINDLER ARDA THE QUEEN OF THE STARS
FROM MOUNT EVER-WHITE HAS UPLIFTED HER HANDS LIKE CLOUDS
AND ALL PATHS ARE DROWNED DEEP IN SHADOW
AND OUT OF A GREY COUNTRY DARKNESS LIES ON THE FOAMING WAVES BETWEEN US
AND MIST COVERS THE JEWELS OF CALACIRYA FOR EVER
NOW LOST LOST TO THOSE FROM THE EAST IS SHALIMAR

FAREWELL MAYBE THOU SHALT FIND SHALIMAR
MAYBE EVEN THOU SHALT FIND IT
FAREWELL



PIPPIN I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD END THIS WAY

GANDALF END NO THE JOURNEY DOESN'T END HERE DEATH IS JUST ANOTHER PATH ONE THAT WE ALL MUST TAKE THE GREY OF THIS WORLD ROLLS BACK AND ALL TURNS TO SILVER GLASS AND THEN YOU SEE IT

PIPPIN WHAT GANDALF SEE WHAT

GANDALF WHITE SHORES AND BEYOND A FAR GREEN COUNTRY UNDER A SWIFT SUNRISE

PIPPIN WELL THAT ISN'T SO BAD

GANDALF NUMBER NO IT ISN'T

THIS HAS NEVER LEFT MY HEAD
WHEN GANDALF AND PIPPIN ARE SAT IN MINAS TIGRISH WOW SHIVERS EVERYTIME

MY FAVORITE HUMOROUS QUOTE

IF YOU WISH TO KNOW I WILL TELL YOU THAT THESE DOORS OPEN OUTWARDS FROM THE INSIDE YOU MAY THRUST THEM OPEN WITH YOUR HANDS FROM THE OUTSIDE NOTHING WILL MOVE THEM SAVE THE SPELL OF COMMAND THEY CANNOT BE FORCED INWARDS

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THEN ASKED PIPPIN UNDAUNTED BY THE WIZARD'S BRISTLING BROWS

KNOCK ON THE DOORS WITH YOUR HEAD PEREGRIN TOOK SAID GANDALF BUT IF THAT DOES NOT SHATTER THEM AND I AM ALLOWED A LITTLE PEACE FROM FOOLISH QUESTIONS I WILL SEEK FOR THE OPENING WORDS
SPEAR SHALL BE SHAKEN SHIELD BE SPLINTERED
A A RED DAY ERE THE SUN RISES
RIDE NOW RIDE NOW RIDE TO CONDOR

WHAT ABOUT SECOND BREAKFAST
IT IS BUT A THOUGHT AND A SHADOW THAT YOU LOVE I CANNOT GIVE YOU WHAT YOU SEEK ARAGON
SO MANY GREAT QUOTES BUT I DO THINK MY FAVOURITE AT THE MOMENT AT LEAST IS

THERE IS NOTHING LADY GALADRIEL SAID GIMLI BOWING LOW AND STAMMERING NOTHING UNLESS IT MIGHT BE UNLESS IT IS PERMITTED TO ASK NAY TO NAME A SINGLE STRAND OF YOUR HAIR WHICH SURPASSES THE GOLD OF THE EARTH AS THE STARS SURPASS THE GEMS OF THE MINE I DO NOT ASK FOR SUCH A GIFT BUT YOU COMMANDED ME TO NAME MY DESIRE

AND THEN GALADRIEL GIVES HIM NOT ONE BUT STRANDS OF HAIR

THIS IS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE SHE DENIES FËANOR HIS REQUEST OF A STRAND OF HER HAIR THREE TIMES
GANDALF HAD THE RING OF FIRE

IT WAS OF LITTLE OR NO USE AGAINST THE BARONG
YES GANDALF HAD ANARYA THE RING OF FIRE BIRDMAN GAVE IT TO HIM THAT IS EXPLAINED IN THE APPENDIX AT THE END OF LOAR IT ALSO EXPLAINS THAT IT HAS THE POWER TO INSPIRE OTHERS AND THE STANDARD POWER OF ALL THE ELDEN RINGS TO HIDE YOURSELF FROM SARON THERE IS NO REFERENCE TO ANY OTHER POWER

I SEARCHED THE EXACT QUOTE AND BIRDMAN SAYS

TAKE THIS RING MASTER HE SAID FOR YOUR LABOURS WILL BE HEAVY BUT IT WILL SUPPORT YOU IN THE WEARINESS THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN UPON YOURSELF FOR THIS IS THE RING OF FIRE AND WITH IT YOU MAY REKINDLE HEARTS IN A WORLD THAT GROWS CHILL

AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE RING ALSO INSPIRES THE USER IT WILL SUPPORT YOU IN THE WEARINESS SO YOU COULD SAY THAT IT HELPED HIM NOT WITH POWER BUT GIVING HIM HOPE


NUMBER IT WAS BURNED LONG AGO BY JOHNNY CASH

BADUMTSSS
AS OTHERS HAVE SAID GANDALF DOES HAVE THE RING OF FIRE BUT HE DOES NOT USE IT AGAINST THE BARONG I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE THINKING OF THIS BECAUSE OF LINE WHEN HE SAYS I AM A SERVANT OF THE SECRET FIRE WIELDER OF THE FLAME OF ACOR

TO BE CLEAR HE IS NOT REFERENCING HIS RING HERE WHEN HE REFERS TO SECRET FIRE HE IS REFERRING TO ERU ILÚVATAR WHO IS THE GOD WITH A CAPITAL G OF UNIVERSE IN SHORT GANDALF IS REVEALING TO THE BARONG THAT DESPITE HIS APPEARANCE HE'S NOT JUST A FEEBLE OLD MAN BUT IS IN FACT A DIVINE BEING SENT DOWN TO MIDDLE EARTH AND IS OF ROUGHLY EQUAL ORDER TO THE BARONG ITSELF

GANDALF IS BASICALLY TELLING THE BARONG THAT IF IT DOESN'T RETREAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE ONE HELL OF A FIGHT ON ITS HANDS

TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN APPARENT AFFINITY FOR FIRE MAGIC HIS POSSESSION OF THE RING OF FIRE AND HIM BEING A SERVANT OF THE SECRET FIRE ARE ALL JUST COINCIDENCE IN THE NAMES
AND IT BURNS BURNS BURNS THE RING OF FIRE THE RING OF FIRE
I DON'T RECALL HIM USING THE RING OF FIRE TO MOTIVATE THE BARONG TO FUCK OFF AAHHAAAHA
WOW VHS IT'S BEEN AWHILE

I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE EXTENDED EDITION HOWEVER
WOW BRAZ KOKO LOVE TRAŽIŠ ZA TO HAHAHAHAHAH
SORRY FOR THE CRAPPY QUALITY HAVE NOT BOTHERED TO GET A DECENT PICTURE YET SHADING IS HALF DONE AND COLOR WILL BE ADDED AS WELL AS SCENERY AROUND THE DOORS

EDIT I'M ALSO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR THE TATTOO NEXT SESSION WILL BE ADDING BLUE TO THE DOORS AND FINISHING THE SHADING PLAN FROM THERE IS TO ADD A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER BELOW AND TWO TREES EITHER SIDE INTERLOCKING AT THE TOP OF THE SHOULDER
DUDE THAT'S AN EXCELLENT START YOU GOTTA KEEP THE UPDATES COMING I WANNA SEE HOW IT PROGRESSES
THAT LOOKS AWESOME
BEYOND EPIC
GORGEOUS TAT MUCH WIZARDRY MANY MAGICS
GLAD YOU LIKE THE DOORS I BUILT
YOU SHOULD GET UV INK FOR THE RUNES ON THE DOOR MELON
GAME OF THRONES A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE MAYBE
AS FAR AS BOOKS GO
IF YOU'RE CERTAIN ABOUT IT BEING A BOOK SERIES THEN IT'S A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE CURRENTLY 6TH IN PROGRESS IT HAS BEEN ADAPTED TO GAME OF THRONES TV SHOW

IF YOU'RE CERTAIN ABOUT CHRONICLES IT'S EITHER KING-KILLER CHRONICLES 2 BOOKS WRITTEN NO SHOW OR SHANKARA BOOKS AND A SHOW IS CALLED SHANKARA CHRONICLES

I'M BLANKING ON SORCERESS BOOKS

IN ANY CASE I RECOMMEND ANY OF THOSE BOOKS READING SHANKARA BOOKS CAN BE DIFFICULT
THE SHANKARA CHRONICLES MAYBE I LIKE THE BOOK BUT WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THE SHOW AT ALL
I KNOW IT IS NOT GOT WHICH I AM CURRENTLY READING I CHECKED OUT SHANKARA CHRONICLES AND I DON'T QUITE THINK THAT WAS IT THANKS EVERYONE I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT
CORRECT ERU WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD THE ABILITY TO RESURRECT GANDALF FROM THE DEAD
AGREE WITH ONLY ERU WITH THE FLAME IMPERISHABLE COULD HAVE RESURRECTED GANDALF REMEMBER AUL CREATED DWARVES BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE LIFE UNTIL ERU GAVE THEM LIFE I HAVE A FEELING IF A ALAR TRIED TO GIVE LIFE BACK TO GANDALF SOMETHING SIMILAR WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
GANDALF STRAYED OUT OF THOUGHT AND TIME MEANING HE LEFT THE MORTAL PLANE AND PASSED BACK INTO THE OUTSIDE WHERE ERU DWELLS SO YEAH ERU RESURRECTED HIM
THIS IS A GOOD ANALYSIS OF THAT BASED ON LETTERS

AS I UNDERSTAND IT GANDALF SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR THE PEOPLE OF MIDDLE EARTH AND BELIEVED IN ILUVATAR JUDGEMENT SO ILUVATAR RESURRECTED HIM WITH EXTRA POWERS OBVIOUSLY INSPIRED BY CHRIST


I LOVE WEARING THIS SHIRT AND HAVING PEOPLE TELL ME THEY THINK THEY HAVE HAD THAT BEER
BELOW IS THE LINK I WAITED FOR A OFF SALE THEY SEEM TO HAVE LOTS OF SALES ON THIS SITE

ELABOR STOUT

SOME OTHERS YOU MIGHT LIKE I'M NOT AFFILIATED WITH THIS COMPANY OR THE SHIRTS ARTISTS JUST THINK THEY ARE COOL AND BOUGHT A FEW

BAG END BREW

MORDOR DARK ALE

RIVENDELL CIDER

GOLDEN HALL PILSNER

GREED DRAGON LAGER

ENTMOOT MAPLE MEED


I'M NOT INTO PRINT BUT I'D TAKE ALL OF THOSE AS POSTERS
BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS
OF COURSE THE DWARVES WOULD DRINK STOUT
IT COMES IN PINTS
I'M NOT THAT HELPFUL AS I CAN'T READ TENGWAR BUT THE WORD MELLON IS ON THE INSCRIPTION ON THE DOORS OF MORIA WITH A TRANSLATION UNDER IT IT IS A PICTURE IN CHAPTER A JOURNEY IN THE DARK YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE PICTURE IF YOU GOOGLE DOORS OF MORIA

YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK THIS QUESTION IN R TENGWAR AS WELL AS THAT IS THE NAME OF THE SCRIPTURE

ASIDE FROM THERE BEING DIFFERENT ELVISH LANGUAGES QUENDA AND SINDARIN WITH SOME DIALECTS AND VARIETIES THERE ARE ALSO A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS TENGWAR WAS USED I THINK THE ONE ON THE DOORS OF MORIA IS CALLED THE MODE OF BELERIAND I'M ASSUMING YOU WANT THAT ONE

I FEEL THAT IT SYMBOLISE THE UPCOMING FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN PERGOLAS THEY EVEN BICKER ABOUT WHOSE FAULT IT WAS THAT THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN ELVES AND DWARVES WAS LOST JUST BEFORE THEY ARRIVE AT THE DOORS

WELL HERE WE ARE AT LAST SAID GANDALF HERE THE FROM
HOLLIN ENDED HOLLY WAS THE TOKEN OF THE PEOPLE OF THAT LAND AND THEY PLANTED
IT HERE TO MARK THE END OF THEIR DOMAIN FOR THE WAS MADE CHIEFLY
FOR THEIR USE IN THEIR TRAFFIC WITH THE LORDS OF MORIA THOSE WERE HAPPIER
DAYS WHEN THERE WAS STILL CLOSE FRIENDSHIP AT TIMES BETWEEN FOLK OF DIFFERENT
RACE EVEN BETWEEN DWARVES AND ELVES

IT WAS NOT THE FAULT OF THE DWARVES THAT THE FRIENDSHIP WANED SAID
GIMLI

I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT IT WAS THE FAULT OF THE ELVES SAID PERGOLAS

I HAVE HEARD BOTH SAID GANDALF AND I WILL NOT GIVE JUDGEMENT NOW
BUT I BEG YOU TWO PERGOLAS AND GIMLI AT LEAST TO BE FRIENDS AND TO HELP ME
I NEED YOU BOTH THE DOORS ARE SHUT AND HIDDEN AND THE SOONER WE FIND THEM
THE BETTER NIGHT IS AT HAND

AND OF COURSE THEY LATER BECOME GOOD FRIENDS
THE DOOR OF MORIA LOOKS LIKE THIS
LOAR IMAGES LATEST CB

THAT'S THE ILLUSTRATION FROM THE BOOK AND THE WORD WOULD BE THE SECOND ONE IN THE RIGHT AFTER THE CIRCLE WITH DOTS AS IT SAYS ENGLYN AURIN ARAN MORIA DEDO MELLON

AS YOU CAN SEE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE ONE YOU HAVE YOURS IS STANDARD SINDARIN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE USE THAT BECAUSE THE FONT TYPEFACE IS EASY TO FIND AND IT LOOKS NICE THE BELERIAND MODE IS DIFFERENT

SOME VARIANTS CAN BE SEEN SIMPLY SEARCHING GOOGLE

SEARCH Q MELLON SOURCE CNMS IBM ISCH SA X BED BW AIH ISCH Q MELLON ELVISH IMGRC WCFNKDIEABPNPM

IF IT WAS ME I WOULD TAKE THE MORIA DOOR CUT THE WORD AND VECTORIZE IT TO MAKE IT BIGGER AND KEEP THE WAY TZOLKIN WROTE IT EVEN WITH HIS WRITING STYLE IF YOU USE A FONT IT WILL LOOK CLEANER BUT I LIKE THE HANDWRITTEN FEEL

GET THE ONE YOU THINK LOOKS BETTER THE ONE YOU CHOOSE IS CORRECT IF THAT'S WHAT WORRIES YOU
ENJOY GETTING RANDOMLY SCREENED AT AIRPORTS IF IT'S VISIBLE THAT IS
I GOT SOME ADVICE ABOUT TATTOOS THAT I'VE ALWAYS FOLLOWED IT'S BASICALLY YOUR TEMP TATTOO IDEA TAKEN FURTHER PRINT OUT WHAT YOU WANT AND STICK IT SOMEPLACE YOU'LL SEE IT EVERY DAY WAIT A YEAR IF IT STILL SEEMS LIKE AN AWESOME IDEA THEN GO FOR IT

I'VE YET TO COME UP WITH ONE THAT PASSES THE TESTAMENT
THE TEMPORARY IDEA IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC I JUST GOT MY FIRST TATTOO AND IT'S SOMETHING I SAT ON FOR A WHILE TZOLKIN HAS BEEN SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO ME FROM A YOUNG AGE AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING I CAN SEE CHANGING HOWEVER I DEFINITELY HAD OTHER TATTOO IDEAS FROM WHEN I WAS THAT I'M GLAD I DID NOT FOLLOW THROUGH WITH

I THINK IF IT'S YOUR FIRST TATTOO AND YOU HAVE EVER THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF DOUBT GET IT IN A PLACE THAT CAN BE EASILY COVERED UP REMEMBER THE TATTOO IS FOR YOU IF IT'S NOT ALWAYS VISIBLE THAT SHOULDN'T MATTER
GREAT IDEA WITH THE TEMPORARY TATTOO I GOT SO COMES SNOW AFTER FIRE AND EVEN DRAGONS HAVE THEIR ENDINGS FROM THE HOBBIT BOOK UNDER A DWARVES FRAME ON MY THIGH I LOVE THE QUOTE BUT THE ARTIST TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTY AVERAGE AND THE LINE WORK ON THE FRAME ISN'T THAT GOOD THICKER IN SOME PLACES THAN OTHERS ETC ALSO HE DISAPPEARED SO I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A NEW ARTIST TO FINISH THE PIECE MY ADVICE IS TO REALLY KNOW THE ARTIST YOU'RE GOING TO AND MAKE SURE THEIR ART AND PREVIOUS WORKS ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MAKE SURE THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT AND DON'T SETTLE FOR LESS ALSO LET THEM KNOW YOUR BUDGET AND STICK TO IT GOOD LUCK
I HAVE THOSE TWO LINES ON MY SHOULDER IN A CIRCLE IN THE LOAR FONT RATHER THAN ANY KIND OF SCRIPT SURROUNDED BY SMUG OVER A YEAR LATER NO REGRETS LOVE IT EVERY TIME I SEE IT
THE TEMPORARY IDEA IS GENIUS TRY IT OUT
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF READING THE LAY OF LECITHIN SO I WAS TICKLED TO SEE THIS ON R FANTASY THE AUTHOR IS INCORRECT ABOUT FORM DURING THE EVENTS OF LOAR BUT NO OTHER EGREGIOUS ERRORS POPPED OUT AT ME
WHEN ROHAN ARRIVES AT THE BATTLE OF PELENNOR FIELDS I GET GOOSEBUMPS AND TEARS EVERY TIME IN THE BOOK THAT WHOLE BATTLE WAS A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE FOR ME
I WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED YOU MY BROTHER MY CAPTAIN MY KING BOOMIER DIES
THE BIT AT ISENGARD WHERE MERRY AND PIPPIN ARE SITTING ON THAT STONE WALL SMOKING PIPE WEED AND THEY TELL GIMLI ABOUT THE SALTED PORK REALLY CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF THE CHEEKY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE TWO
I LOVE THE GREY HAVENS AS WELL AS GANDALF TELLING PIPPIN ABOUT WHAT COMES AFTER DEATH



END NO THE JOURNEY DOESN'T END HERE DEATH IS JUST ANOTHER PATHOLOGY ONE THAT WE ALL MUST TAKE

SCREAM OF NO WHEN FRODO PUTS ON THE RING IN MOUNT DOOM HE DOESN'T KNOW GOING TO SHOW UP HE JUST WITNESSED THEIR ENTIRE EXPERIENCE FAIL AND THE DEATH OF MIDDLE-EARTH IT'S POTENT
WATCH V YGBEVZYNIOE
IMMORTAL SPEECH BEFORE THE CHARGE OF ROHAN I MEAN IF I WAS IN AN ARMY OR A CIVIL WAR AND A LEADER SPOKE TO ME LIKE THAT I WOULDN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT LIVING OR DIEING I WOULD JUST ATTACK LIKE A CRAZY MANIAC LONGING FOR DEATH

DEATH
WHEN GANDALF RIDES OUT TO SAVE FARAMIR FROM THE NAGUAL AT MINAS TIGRISH THAT SCENE IS STUNNING
FACE AT THE COUNCIL WHEN FRODO SAYS HE WILL TAKE THE RING TO MORDOR
THE JOURNEY THROUGH LOTHLORIEN
WHEN GANDALF WENT KAMIKAZE AND SHOUTED YOU SHALL NOT PASS AND FLY YOU FOOLS
WHEN THEOWMEN TALKS TO GANDALF ABOUT DEATH
ON THE FARAMIR POINT PETER JACKSON SAID HE FELT THAT THE POWER OF THE RING WAS UNDERMINED IF FARAMIR REJECTED IT SO EASILY I THINK IT WORKS IN THE FILM JUST FINE AND I DON'T VIEW FARAMIR AS WEAKER FOR IT SINCE HE STILL HAD THE RESOLVE TO SEND FRODO ON HIS WAY EVENTUALLY AND HIS ARC IN ROK REALLY DRIVES HOME HIS CHARACTER
FRODO IS MIDDLE AGED FOR A HOBBIT THINK OF HIM BEING LIKE RATHER THAN HIS ACTUAL DURING THE QUEST

AND THE ONLY THINGS I DISAGREE WITH YOU ON HERE ARE FARAMIR AND THE SCOURING IT'D BE SUPER EASY TO FIT IN THE SCOURING AND THE OMISSION LEAVES OUT A VERY IMPORTANT MORAL THINGS CHANGE WHEN YOU'RE GONE AND FARAMIR WAS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE BOOK SECOND TO SAM OF COURSE AS HE WAS A CALL BACK TO A MORE NOBLE AGE THE WHOLE STORY BETWEEN HIM BOOMIER AND DENETHOR II WAS SO SAD BOOMIER OF COURSE REDEEMED HIMSELF AT THE LAST MINUTE BUT HAD DENETHOR II GOTTEN OVER HIS BELOVED SON AND SENT THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB THE FELLOWSHIP MIGHT NOT HAVE BROKEN AT ALL FARAMIR WOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED A LAST MINUTE REPENTANCE

AND YOU DIDN'T MENTION IT BUT I THINK GLORFINDEL SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN REMOVED EXTENDED STUFF IN THE MOVIE WAS OKAY IF A BIT MISUNDERSTOOD ON THE WHOLE CHOOSING OF HER DOOM THING BUT GLORFINDEL IS SO AWESOME PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT TOM BOBADIL BUT FORGET ABOUT THE ELF THAT SLEW SEVERAL BARONGS AND THEN RETURNED TO MIDDLE-EARTH TO FIGHT ONCE MORE

AND AS MUCH AS I LIKE THE PART WITH BOBADIL I THINK IT'S BEST LEFT OUT OF AN ADAPTATION TO FILM IT'S SO BIZARRE WORKS IN BOOKS BUT NOT IN MOVIES KINDA LIKE THE MONOLOGUES DREAMS VISIONS AND FLASHBACKS A LOT OF CHARACTERS HAVE
GOOD THOUGHTS A LOT TO GET TO

I KNOW A LOT OF IDEAS HARD FANS WERE UPSET WITH THE YOUNGER FRODO IN THE MOVIES BUT IT WORKS FOR ME
I HAVE YET TO READ ALL THE BOOKS I AM STARTING ON THE TWO TOWERS TOMORROW PROBABLY BUT I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT IN THE CASE OF FELLOWSHIP THE MOVIE SEEMED MUCH MORE LIGHT HEARTED A FRIEND WHO READ THE BOOKS ALSO SAID THAT SHE FELT THE MOVIES TRIED TO PAINT A LIGHTER TONE

THE FELLOWSHIP ALONE PRESENTS A MUCH MORE DANGEROUS WORLD IN THE NOVEL WHEN THE HOBBITS ARE CAPTURED BY THE I FEEL LIKE THAT IS ITS NAME I COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG BUT FRODO ACTUALLY CONSIDERS LEAVING HIS FRIENDS TO DIE AND MOVE ON WITH THE RING BY HIMSELF ALSO ALL THE CHARACTERS SEEM MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT MARY AND PIPPIN IN THE MOVIES I FEEL ARE LEFT TO THE SIDE AND PIPPIN REALLY IS COMIC RELIEF OR TOO STUPID TO SURVIVE UNTIL THE LAST HALF OF RETURN IF THE KING WHILE FRODO AND SAM ARE CERTAINLY THE STRONGER CHARACTERS FOR THE HOBBITS MARY AND PIPPIN DON'T FEEL USELESS TO ME IN THE BOOKS

ALSO LETS NOT FORGET HOW FRODO ALMOST GETS KILLED BY AN ARROW ON THE RIVER ALNUIN THE MITHRAIC SERVES ANOTHER PURPOSE

EDIT ALL IN ALL THOUGH AND I BELIEVE THIS THE FACT THAT JACKSON WAS ABLE TO MAKE GENUINELY GOOD ADAPTATIONS OF THESE BOOKS THREE TIMES IN A ROW IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE HOW YOU BEGIN TO ADAPT A WORLD SO RICH AND COMPLEX AS MIDDLE-EARTH
I LOVE THE BOOKS I AM A FAN OF THE MOVIES IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SEPARATE AND NOT BE A LITTLE MAD AT JACKSON BECAUSE I WILL NEVER SEE THEM DONE THE WAY I WANT YES SELFISH I ADMIT MY ISSUES ARE A REITERATION OF SOME AND ONE THAT SEEMS TO BE MISSED SO FAR
PROMINENT ROLL NOT A FAN I MISSED GLORFINDEL AND DESPISE THAT THEY GAVE HER THE FLOOD SCENE

FRODO APPEARS WEAK AND DOESN'T REFUSE THE WRAITHS AT THE FORD OF BRUCINE

2 THE SHIRE PART OF THE REASON FRODO CAN'T STAY IS BECAUSE HE SET OUT TO SAVE THE SHIRE BUT FELT LIKE HE REALLY DIDN'T BECAUSE OF THE BLOOD SPILLED ON HIS DOORSTEP
ARAGON FEARING NOT WANTING HIS DESTINY IN THE BOOKS HE DOUBTS HIS STRENGTH A LITTLE BUT HE NEVER TURNS AWAY FROM HIS DESTINY HE ANXIOUSLY AWAITS FOR THE TIME HE CARRIES AROUND THE SHARDS OF GARSIL HE IS SPOILING FOR HIS CHANCE I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY THAT WAS CHANGED
GANDALF LOOKS WEAK IN THE MOVIES LIKE THE ONLY THING HE DOES IS FIREWORKS NO WOLVES NO STANDOFF AT THE DOOR WITH THE BARONG

THE WITCH KING BREAKING STAFFORDSHIRE NOPE

FARAMIR IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID

SAM LEAVING NEVER EVER I DESPISE THE SCENE

ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENES IF NOT THE FAVORITE IS MY FRIENDS YOU BOW TO NO ONE
GREAT DISCUSSION THANKS FOR WRITING THIS SO YOU HAVE ONLY JUST READ THE BOOKS DID YOU SEE THE MOVIES FIRST AND YOU PROVIDED SOME EXCELLENT OBSERVATIONS BUT I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU FELT AFTER FINISHING THE MOVIES AND BOOKS

I HAVE READ THE BOOKS AND WATCHED THE FILMS COUNTLESS TIMES I LOVE THEM STILL AND NEVER FEEL THE SAME WHEN I FINISH FOR ME I VIEW THE BOOKS AND FILMS SEPARATELY AND BELIEVE THEY EACH STAND ON THEIR OWN MERITS MASTERFUL WORKS I APPRECIATE BOTH THE ART AND STORY OF BOTH

THIS POST IS REMINDING ME IT'S ABOUT TIME TO GET THE BOOKS DOWN AGAIN
FRODO WAS MUCH MORE PROMINENT IN THE MOVIES

I REALLY NOTICED THIS AND THOUGHT IT WAS A FLAW IN ROK I UNDERSTAND WHY JACKSON DECIDED TO HAVE MERRY PIPPIN AS CARDBOARD INITIALLY BUT BY THE END OF THE THIRD FILM THEY COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER DEVELOPED AND A LOT OF THE SCENES WITH FRODO AND SAM PALL

IN THE BOOKS I BELIEVE HE WAS OLDER I REALLY GOT THE IMPRESSION HE WAS MORE OF A NARKY OLD MAN IN THE BOOKS

THE MOVIE IS PRETTY GOOD ON THIS FRODO IS WHICH IS THE HOBBIT EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT BILBO WAS OLDER IN THE HOBBIT

FARAMIR WAS WEAKER IN THE MOVIES LIKE A SECOND BOOMIER THEY HAVE HIM WANT TO TAKE THE RING IN THE MOVIES

I AGREE THIS IS WEAK WE SEE FARAMIR S TEMPTATION IN THE BOOKS BUT IT SEEMS HAMMED IN THE MOVIES

CAN'T GET OVER SAM LEAVING FRODO

NEITHER CAN I JACKSON SEEMED TO WANT TO MAKE THE CHARACTERS A LITTLE LESS BLACK AND WHITE OR SOMETHING BUT THIS IS HAM-FISTED

THE THEMES WERE DIFFERENT IN THE BOOKS I GOT THE SENSE THAT THERE WAS A THEME OF HOPE AND BEAUTY OF NATURE AND FRIENDS AMIDST THEIR DIFFICULT TASK THE MOVIES WERE SIMILAR BUT THE SENSE OF DOOM WAS MUCH MORE FOREBODING AND MORE BATTLES AND VIOLENCE THE BATTLES HELPED ADD SUSPENSE AND SUSTAIN MY INTEREST BUT THEY SEEMED MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOK

THIS IS THE CRUX OF AN INEVITABLE PROBLEM WITH THE MOVIES TZOLKIN WAS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN AGHAST AT THE BATTLE SCENES SOME OF IT IS ALL RIGHT BUT THE STUFF WITH PERGOLAS AND GIMLI IS JUST AWFUL

THEIR WAS SOMEWHAT OF A LACK OF POLITICS IN THE MOVIES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MOVIES THEOWMEN SERVES SAURURAN BECAUSE HE IS UNDER A SPELL IN THE BOOKS HE WAS SIMPLY CONVINCED TO SERVE SAURURAN BECAUSE OF WORDS AND FEAR

I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE MOVIES DO THIS PRETTY WELL ALL TOLD AT LEAST THE EXTENDED VERSIONS THE BOOKS DEPICT THEOWMEN AS ENSORCELED AND THIS IS A GREAT CASE OF THE VERY SUBTLE MAGIC WHICH INFUSES TZOLKIN S NARRATIVES WORM-TONGUED IS A VECTOR FOR THAT ENCHANTMENT GANDALF LITERALLY BREAKS THE SPELL

IN THE MOVIES SAURURAN WAS SIMPLY AS SERVANT OF SARON IN THE BOOKS SAURURAN WAS DESCRIBED AS PLAYING THE SIDE THAT BENEFITTED HIM

AGAIN THIS IS COMPLICATED BY THE TIME WE RUN ACROSS HIM SAURURAN HAS GIVEN WAY TO DESPAIR AND HIS ONLY HOPE IS THE RING OTHER THAN THAT HE IS SIMPLY A SERVANT OF MORDOR

THE EXTRA ARWEN SCENES HELPED TO ADD WEIGHT TO QUEST

THE WRITING IS LEADEN THOUGH

THE WRESTLE BETWEEN FRODO AND GOLLUM ON MT DOOM IT ADDED SUSPENSE AND THE CONCLUSION WAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THE RING DESTROYED ITSELF THROUGH IT'S OWN VIOLENCE

THIS IS ALL GOOD BY ME TOO

THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE SAURURAN ESSENTIALLY DIED THE SAME WAY THROUGH THE SAME PRINCIPLES HIS FAILURE AND EVIL CAUSED HIS OWN DEMISE LOVED THAT CHAPTER BUT I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO FIT IN THE MOVIE

YEARS BEFORE THE FILMS WERE CONCEIVED I KNEW THAT THIS CHAPTER WOULD BE REMOVED FROM AN EVENTUAL FILM IT S THE BEST CHAPTER IN THE BOOKS BUT IT IS EASILY CUT OUT WITHOUT CAUSING PROBLEMS

I GOTTA DISAGREE STRONGLY WITH OMITTING THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE FROM THE FILMS IT CHANGES THE STORY SIGNIFICANTLY IF THE SHIRE ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE WAR OF THE RING AT ALL

PETER JACKSON ALSO MADE A MAJOR MISTAKE WITH THE SHADOW GHOST FELL ARMY IN THE BOOKS THEY BASICALLY SCARED PEOPLE IN THE MOVIES THEY WERE AN UNSTOPPABLE KILLING MACHINE
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS RECENTLY FINISHED THE BOOKS FOR THE FIRST AND AM CURRENTLY REREADING THEM I CAN DEFINITELY SAY THERE ARE POINTS THE MOVIE OUTSHINES THE BOOK AND VICE VERSA I'D SAY BY MY PREFERENCE THEY ARE BOTH EQUAL

I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO SCENES IN THE BOOK THAT I LOVED FROM THE MOVIE SUCH AS LAST WORDS I FOLLOWED YOU MY BROTHER MY CAPTAIN MY KING BUT THEY WERE ODDLY SHORT AND THERE WERE SCENES FROM THE BOOK I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY CHANGED SUCH AS ESCAPE FROM THE NAZGÛL YOU WILL HAVE NEITHER THE RING NOR ME

THEY ARE BOTH ARE MY FAVORITE OF EACH CATEGORY MOVIE AND BOOK SERIES AND IF YOU ASKED ME TO SPECIFY ONE IT WOULD BE LIKE PICKING A FAVORITE CHILD THEY ARE BOTH EXCELLENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE EVENTS OF MIDDLE EARTH AND NOTHING LESS
I'VE HAD MANY YEARS TO MULL THIS OVER SO FORGIVE THE LENGTH

I READ THE BOOKS A FEW TIMES BEFORE THE MOVIES HAD COME OUT I'VE WATCHED THE EXTENDED AND THEATRICAL MORE OFTEN THE EXTENDED BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE COMPLETE

JACKSON CHANGED THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE STORY IN SEVERAL KEY WAYS

TOM BOBADIL IS THE HEART AND SOUL OF MIDDLE EARTH AND I BELIEVE THAT ALMOST LITERALLY HE'S AN AINU HE AND GOLDBERRY ARE THE GOODNESS OF THE LAND THE BEAUTY OF NATURE CUTTING HIM WAS UNFORGIVABLE THEY FIND THE MAGIC SWORDS IN A BARROW IN THE MOVIES THEY ARE JUST HANDED SWORDS AT BREE WHAT A WASTE THE NATURAL THEMES ARE MUCH TRUNCATED ANTS NOTWITHSTANDING

2 EACH TIME HUMANS IN THE BOOKS BAND TOGETHER JACKSON CHANGES IT TO SOME OTHER REASON HELMSDEEP IN THE BOOKS IT'S ONLY GANDALF AND THE RIDERS THAT SAVE THEOWMEN IN THE MOVIE ELVES HELP AND FAKE ELF WINDS UP DYING A POINTLESS FAKE DEATH BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW BEFORE GANDALF COMES WITH COMER ET AL JACKSON ROBS THE SPIRIT OF THE BOOK HUMANS ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO STAND TOGETHER TO DEFEAT THE DARKNESS BY THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE ELVES DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT HUMANS THEY'RE PEACING OUT TO ALIENOR

SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR THE BATTLE OF ELINOR FIELDS IN THE BOOKS ARAGON LEADS THE GHOST PEOPLE AND THE DUNEDIN AGAINST THE MARAUDERS COMING DOWN RIVER TO JOIN THE ORCS HORDE OR MORDOR THEN ARAGON RELEASES THE GHOSTS THE DUNEDIN ALONE LAND AT ELINOR AND FIGHT THEIR WAY TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BATTLE SAVING THE RIDERS OF ROHAN FROM ASSURED DOOM IN THE MOVIE NO DUNEDIN JUST GHOSTS KILL THE MARAUDERS AND EVERYTHING AT CONDOR THERE IS NO ENDURING LOVE FOR THE SPIRIT AND STRENGTH OF HUMANITY IN WORLD THAT'S SAD

AND IT GOES PERFECTLY WITH YOUR THOUGHT THAT SAM WILLINGLY LEAVING HIM FOR A SECOND IS INCONCEIVABLE STRENGTH IN UNITY IS REPLACED BY A CYNICAL NEED FOR SUPERNATURAL EXPLANATIONS AND CGI OPPORTUNITIES

THAT SAID I STILL LOVE MUCH OF WHAT HE DID WITH LOAR I JUST OBJECT TO THE COMPLETE EVISCERATION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME IN SEVERAL PLACES EVEN IF IT IS UPHELD IN WAYS LIKE THE LAST BATTLE
TL R JACKSON SCREWED THE MAJOR THEME BUT KEPT SOME COOL MOMENTS
HOBBIT WAS GODAWFUL EXCEPT FOR SMUG
EDIT AINU NOT MAAR I DIDN'T REMEMBER CORRECTLY

IF THE MOVIE HAD MORE POLITICS AND LESS CONFLICTS WE WOULD HAVE HAD A SECOND STAR WARS PREQUEL TRILOGY S

BUT I THINK P MADE ALL THE RIGHT CHOICES OF COURSE AS A BOOK READER I HAVE MY SET OF THOUGHTS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT AT LEAST MOST OF THE CHOICES MAKE SENSE FOR EXAMPLE NEW CONFLICTS AND MORE BATTLES ARE AS YOU EXPERIENCED YOURSELF TO KEEP MOVIE WATCHERS ENTERTAINED THERE'S MORE CONFLICTS THERE'S MORE ACTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT MOVIE WATCHERS WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
ARAGON FALLING OFF THE CLIFF DOES HAVE ONE REDEEMING FACTOR WHEN ARAGON IS RIDING TO HELMS DEEP HE THE FULL SCALE OF ARMY WHICH MAKES THE TENSION BETWEEN CHARACTERS ESPECIALLY HIM AND PERGOLAS ALL THE MORE GREAT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY FACE IMPOSSIBLE ODDS
VERY COOL TO SEE YOUR REACTIONS
I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE WRESTLING ON THE EDGE OF THE CRACK OF DOOM I FEEL THAT IT SENT AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MESSAGE THAN THAT SENT IN THE BOOK IN THE BOOK ACTIONS LED TO HIS OWN DESTRUCTION IN THE MOVIE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE DIED IF NOT FOR AGGRESSION
SOME GREAT COMMENTARY HERE I'M IN THE CAMP OF THOSE WHO ARE VERY CRITICAL OF P AND HIS ADAPTATIONS A FEW ISSUES I HAD WITH THE FILMS THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN MENTIONED YET

ARAGON FIGHTING OFF THE RINGWRAITHS ON FEATHERTOP IN THE BOOKS ARAGON ADMITS THAT THE NAGUAL DEPARTED ON THEIR OWN ACCORD THIS SCENE IS THE BEGINNING OF P UNDERMINING THE TERRIFYING THREAT THAT THE RINGWRAITHS ARE TO JUST ABOUT ANYONE OTHER THAN GANDALF

FRODO BEING ROBBED OF HIS YOU SHALL HAVE NEITHER ME OR THE RING SCENE AT THE FORD THIS IS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE WHOLE ARWEN VS GLORFINDEL DEBATE THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOMENTS IN FELLOWSHIP AND P UNDERMINES STRENGTH OF CHARACTER AND LOSES THE CHILLING REACTION OF THE NAGUAL TO DEFIANCE

ARAGON FALLING OFF THE CLIFF TO HIS DEATH IN TWO TOWERS WTF WAS P THINKING

FRODO OFFERING THE RING IN OUTSTRETCHED HAND TO A FLYING NAGUAL DURING THE BATTLE OF OSGILIATH SCENE THIS IS HORRIBLE ON SO MANY LEVELS IT ONCE AGAIN CHEAPENS CHARACTER 2 IT DESTROYS THE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY OF WORLD WHICH REQUIRED THAT THE LOCATION OF THE RING REMAIN HIDDEN FROM SARON IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN IF THE RING HAD BEEN OPENLY REVEALED TO A NAGUAL AS DEPICTED IN THE FILM THAT INFORMATION WOULD HAVE BEEN QUICKLY COMMUNICATED TELEPATHICALLY BACK TO SARON AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GAME OVER THE FILM DEPICTS THE NAGUAL BEING DRIVEN OFF BY MEN FIRING ARROWS AT IT SERIOUSLY AT THIS POINT P HAS TURNED THE RINGWRAITHS INTO IMPOTENT BUFFOONS IN THE BOOKS THE SOLDIERS WOULD HAVE BEEN COWERING IN TERROR AND THE NAGUAL WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FROM ANY MEAGER RESISTANCE THEY COULD OFFER
NICE DISCUSSION
I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS SAME THING LAST TIME I WATCHED THE MOVIES
OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COOL IF THE MOVIES HAD STAYED MORE TRUE TO THE BOOKS BUT IN REALITY FEW OF PJ'S CHANGES REALLY BOTHER ME CURRENTLY I CAN ONLY THINK OF

THE SCENE IN TWO TOWERS WITH ARAGON FALLING OFF THE CLIFF IS STUPID
ELVES AT HELMS DEEP

THERE ARE OTHER THINGS I'D WISH WERE DIFFERENT LIKE

STICKING CLOSER TO THE BOOKS WITH REGARDS TO THE ARMY OF THE DEAD
INTRODUCING THE GREY COMPANY AT THE END OF TWO TOWERS AND HAVE THEM ACCOMPANY ARAGON AND CO
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE GLORFINDEL
NO IMRAHIL AND KNIGHTS OF DOL AGOROTH
THE SCENE IN RETURN OF THE KING WITH THE PEOPLES OF CONDOR ARRIVING IN MINAS TIGRISH WOULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME ABOVE ALL TO SHOW THAT CONDOR IS MORE THAN JUST MINAS TIGRISH

BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE THINGS I JUST LISTED WEREN'T INCLUDED DUE TO THINGS LIKE PACING MAKING THE STORY RELATIVELY EASY TO FOLLOW FOR PEOPLE NEW TO TZOLKIN AND TO KEEP THE MOVIES AT A REASONABLE LENGTH AS THERE OBVIOUSLY IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BOOK AND FILM FORMATS AS OTHER POSTERS HAVE POINTED OUT

HOWEVER IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I READ THE BOOKS WHEN I READ THEM AGAIN I MIGHT FIND MORE THINGS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN MENTIONED YET IS SHELDON I WATCHED THE TRILOGY WHEN I WAS WAY YOUNGER AND ONLY READ THE BOOKS EARLIER THIS YEAR AND THE ENCOUNTER WITH SHELDON WAS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PARTS INSTEAD OF JUST BEING SOME GIANT RANDOM SPIDER THE BOOK REALLY EMPHASISED THE PURE EVIL THING THAT SHELDON WAS AND SAM ALSO SEEMS TO BE THREE TIMES MORE HAM ON HER THAN THE MOVIE

ALSO A FEW SCENES I REALISE DON'T MAKE MUCH SENSE IN TT MOVIE WHEN THE NAGUAL NEARLY GRABS FRODO AS HE'S HOLDING THE RING AT OSGILIATH I THOUGHT THEY WEREN'T MEANT TO BE AWARE AT THAT STAGE THAT FRODO IS THE ONE THAT HAS THE RING LIKEWISE IN ROK WHEN THE LITERAL EYE OF SARON SEES FRODO AND SAM BUT NOTHING HAPPENS
ONE THING YOU LEFT OUT WAS THE GALADRIEL FREAKING OUT PART IN THE MOVIES CIRC THE WHOLE PART THAT SHE WAS TEMPTED AND THEN TURNED INTO SOMEWHAT OF A WITCH ETC WAS NOT IN THE BOOK IT DID NOT REALLY MAKE SENSE AS SHE HERSELF HAS A RING OF POWER AND IS THE VERY DAUGHTER OF FINARFIN KING OF THIRION
I REALLY DISLIKE THE EXTENDED EDITIONS AND IT IS VERY EASY FOR ME TO SEE WHY THEY CUT OUT A LOT OF THOSE SCENES A LOT OF THEM WERE UNNECESSARY AND OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T FIT WITH THE TONE OF THE REST OF THE MOVIE I THINK THE OBVIOUSNESS OF THE SCENE AS SPEAKS TO HOW OUT-OF-PLACE IT IS THE THEATRICAL EDITIONS ARE MUCH BETTER IN MY OPINION
LOAR ISN'T A TRILOGY
I'VE NEVER BEEN TEMPTED TO WATCH THE MOVIES AGAIN ENOUGH SAID I WAS APPALLED AT WHAT I SAW OF THE HOBBIT TRILOGY NEVER BOTHERED WATCHING THE THIRD
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WATCH THE EXTENDED EDITIONS FOR YEARS NOW ANY IDEA WHERE I COULD FIND THEM FOR FREE
BOOK AND MOVIE ARENT THE SAME MEDIUM IF YOU WOULD TAKE A BOOK AS ONE TO ONE INSTRUCTIONS FOR A MOVIE THE MOVIE WOULD SUCK THIS IS SO BECAUSE OF VARIOUS REASONS THAT I FONT ALL KNOW SO YEAH

THE REASON WHY THE JOVI E IS SO GREAT IS BECAUSE PETER JACKSON DID A FU NG GOOD JOB AT CONDENSING THE IMMENSE STORY OF THE BOOK TO TREE HOURS OF MOVIE
THAT'S FANTASTIC EXCELLENT CRAFTSMANSHIP SO RARE TO SEE GOOD ART DONE BY HAND THESE DAYS
THIS LOOKS AMAZING GREAT WORK
I REALLY LOVE THIS MAY HAVE TO MAKE IT MY NEW LOCK SCREEN IMAGE IF THAT'S OK SO PERFECT FOR FALL
LOVELY
WHAT UP ZELDA
BEAUTIFUL LOVE THE COLORS GRADUALLY FORMING UP THE BACKGROUND
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I AM GLAD THAT YOU LIKE HER
I WAS TOLD R LOAR MIGHT APPRECIATE THIS

CHEERS
THIS IS INCREDIBLE
WAS THIS ONE HETP YOUR WORK TOO I COULDN'T TELL FROM THE DESCRIPTION FOR SURE

IF SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU PLEASE REVISE YOUR TEMPLATE BEFORE DOING ANY MORE OF THAT DESIGN AS IT'S USING A FAULTY RECREATION OF THE TENGWAR INSCRIPTION BASED ON A MISUSE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATED COMPUTER TYPEFACE IT'S A IMAGE SEARCH RESULT FOR DOORS OF AURIN MORIA OR SIMILAR BUT THE TEXT IS GIBBERISH COMPARE IT WITH THE ILLUSTRATION FROM THE BOOK HETP
I DON'T FEEL THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PART OF FELLOWSHIP IT IS JUST THAT THERE ARE LONG BITS THAT DON'T MOVE THE PLOT FORWARD BUT INSTEAD EXPLAIN THINGS ABOUT THE CULTURE OF THE SHIRE AND THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH I WOULD KEEP READING AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER THE CHAPTER THE COUNCIL OF ELROD

IN THE MOVIES THEY NEEDED OR AT LEAST FELT THEY NEEDED TO STICK TO THE MAJOR PLOT POINTS THE BOOKS SOMETIMES MEANDER OFF INTO THINGS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT WHICH IS IN MY OPINION A GREAT THING A STRIKING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MOVIE AND THE BOOK IS WHEN THEY GO TO BUCKLEBURY FERRY IN THE MOVIE FRODO GETS CHASED BY A RINGWRAITH AND BARELY MAKES IT BY JUMPING ON THE FERRY WHILE IN THE BOOK WE TAKE A BREAK FROM THE MAIN STORY AND GET A FEW PARAGRAPHS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF BUCKLAND AND THE FAMILY OF MERRY BRANDYBUCK AND THEIR ANCESTORS THE OLDBUCKS

AND READING LOAR MORE THAN ONCE MAKES IT BETTER THERE IS A LOT HAPPENING IN BEFORE THEY GET TO BREE THAT YOU PROBABLY WON'T GET ON A FIRST READ BECAUSE YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT SUPPOSED TO THE CHAPTER A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED COMPLETELY CHANGES THE WAY TO LOOK AT BEHAVIOUR IN THE CHAPTERS BEFORE IT AND ALSO ON HOW THE FELLOWSHIP ENDS THAT BIT WAS OMITTED FROM THE MOVIE COMPLETELY IN A SIMILAR WAY THE CHAPTERS WITH TOM BOBADIL WERE OMITTED FROM THE MOVIES THEY DIDN'T REALLY MOVE THE PLOT FORWARD BUT THEY EXPLAINED SOME HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF MIDDLE-EARTH AND THERE IS A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF FORESHADOWING THAT YOU PROBABLY WON'T UNDERSTAND ON A FIRST READ BUT IS VERY INTERESTING ON A SECOND READ

THE BOOK ISN'T REALLY STRUCTURED AS PEOPLE EXPECT FROM A NOVEL I DOUBT IT WOULD BE PUBLISHED TODAY EDITORS WOULD PROBABLY BUTCHER THE BOOK SO THE READER GETS THE PLOT FED TO HIM IN DIGESTIBLE BITS YET SOMEHOW LOAR IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR BOOKS OF ALL TIME

BUT YEAH THINGS SPEED UP A LOT ONE OF THE LINES FROM THE MOVIES THAT ARE NOT IN THE BOOK BUT THAT I STILL THINK IS INTERESTING IS THE ONE WHERE GANDALF MOUNTS SHADOWFAX AND HE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE FOR MANY LIVES OF MEN I HAVE WANDERED THIS EARTH AND NOW I HAVE NO TIME WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TIMELINE GANDALF AND ARAGON DO A LOT OF STUFF IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE LEARNING NOTHING NEW ARE YOU IN CHAPTER THREE YET IT'S WILDLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIES
DOES IT READ FASTER AFTER THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS

ABSOLUTELY YES

THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS ARE THE SLOWEST OF THE ENTIRE STORY THINGS START ACTUALLY HAPPENING AFTER THEY LEAVE THE SHIRE
IT DOES READ FASTER AFTER THEY LEAVE THE SHIRE DO YOU USUALLY READ IN A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN READ ALOUD TO YOURSELF SOMETIMES KEEPING MYSELF ENTERTAINED WITH NARRATION AND VOICES HELPS ME THROUGH SLOWER PASSAGES
THERE ARE SOME RATHER LONG DULL SECTIONS JUST THE WAY IT IS WRITTEN

YOU COULD TRY THE AUDIO BOOKS
I'VE FOUND THE FIRST HALF OF FELLOWSHIP TO BE THE DULLEST PART EVEN THOUGH I LIKE MOST OF THE BACKSTORY AND INFORMATION IN THE VERY BEGINNING TO ME THE WORST PART OF THE SERIES EXCLUDING SOME OF FRODO AND SAM IN TWO TOWERS IS FROM BREE TO RIVENDELL I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE WANTS TO READ AN ENDLESS STREAM OF AND THEN THEY WALKED AROUND THIS HILL OVER THAT RIVER ETC

AFTER THEY GET TO RIVENDELL IN MY OPINION IS WHEN IT REALLY PICKS UP MUCH OF THE EXPOSITION IS MORE RELEVANT AND FROM THEN ON THERE'S A LOT MORE ACTUALLY HAPPENING THEN AGAIN THE BOOKS JUST MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU THEY'RE A VERY DIFFERENT MEDIUM AND IT CAN TAKE A LOT OF PATIENCE I RECOMMEND LISTENING TO THE SOUNDTRACKS ON PANDORA OR YOUTUBE WHILE READING
UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM BUT I CONCUR WITH OTHERS IT PICKS UP A LOT AFTER A BIT

THAT SAID A SECOND READING IN THE FUTURE WILL PROBABLY BE A LOT MORE ENJOYABLE YOU ACTUALLY MIGHT ENJOY THOSE SLOW AND MORE INNOCENT TIMES

I WOULD RECOMMEND FINISH THE BOOKS AND THEN RECATCH THE MOVIES IT MAKES FOR AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE AND NOT JUST OBVIOUSLY FOR THE LOAR I RECENTLY REREAD THE STAND AND IT AND THEN WATCHED THE MOVIES RIGHT AFTER EACH BOOK I MADE A LOT MORE CONNECTIONS AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT
TO PUT IT PLAINLY FELLOWSHIP PRESENTS SOME OF THE BEST EXPOSITION I'VE EVER READ KEEP READING YOU'LL LOVE IT I MEAN MAYBE YOU WON'T BUT LIKE PLEASE KEEP READING
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN READING THE BOOKS YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE ORCS DON'T REALLY LIKE SARON OR SAURURAN BUT THEY FIGHT FOR THEM ANYWAY THIS IS THE ONLY QUOTE THAT HINTS AT ANYTHING ABOUT THE MEN WHO FOUGHT FOR SARON BEING SOMETHING OTHER THAN EVIL AUTOMATONS
THIS QUOTE DOESN'T APPEAR IN THE REGULAR EDITION OF THE TRILOGY RIGHT
SINCE TZOLKIN DIDN'T WRITE THIS IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SAY THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY HIS EXPERIENCES
IT WAS NEVER WRITTEN AND AS FAR AS I KNOW IT WAS NO LONGER AN ISSUE AT ALL IN HIS LATER WRITINGS MIDDLE-EARTH WILL BECOME OUR WORLD AND END OF HISTORY WILL BE MORE IN LINE WITH CHRISTIAN ESCHATOLOGY I SUPPOSE

IN HIS LATER YEARS TZOLKIN CONSIDERED ENTIRE QUANTA SILMARILLION TO BE A COLLECTION OF LEGENDS AND TRADITIONS WITHIN THE SECONDARY WORLD ITSELF LARGELY COMPILED DURING THE THIRD AGE AND BY MEN NOT SO MUCH BY ELVES AND NOT TRUSTWORTHY ESPECIALLY IN ITS COSMOLOGICAL CLAIMS ABOUT FLAT EARTH AND SUN AND MOON BEING THE FRUIT AND FLOWER OR LAURELING AND TELPERION
I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE A RETURN JOURNEY MR FRODO

TO ME IT SIGNIFIES THE CHANGE AND GROWTH IN IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL HE GOES FROM A HUMBLE YET LOYAL SERVANT TO AN EQUAL ALONGSIDE FRODO LEADING HIM ON THE LAST LEG OF THEIR JOURNEY
I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE WITH ME HERE AT THE END OF ALL THINGS SAM

FRODO SAYS THIS TO SAM AS THEY SIT ON THE SIDE OF MOUNT DOOM AS IT ERUPTS THEY'VE ESSENTIALLY ACCEPTED THAT THEY WON'T LEAVE OR SEE THE SHIRE AGAIN I READ THIS AND THOUGHT ABOUT HOW MUCH SAM PLANNED FOR THE JOURNEY HOME AND THEN HE JUST ACCEPTED HIS FATE AND SAT WITH FRODO WAITING FOR DEATH SAM IS PROBABLY THE BACKBONE OF THE ADVENTURE STICKING WITH FRODO NO MATTER WHAT HE NEVER LOSES HOPE EVEN WHEN THINGS GET DARKEST AND SEEING HIM WITH NOTHING LEFT TOOK SOMETHING OUT OF ME
NOW NEWS CAME TO HITHLUM THAT DORTHONION WAS LOST AND THE SONS OF FINARFIN OVERTHROWN AND THAT THE SONS OF FËANOR WERE DRIVEN FROM THEIR LANDS THEN FINGOLFIN BEHELD THE UTTER RUIN OF THE NOLUDAR AND THE DEFEAT BEYOND REDRESS OF ALL THEIR HOUSES AND FILLED WITH WRATH AND DESPAIR HE MOUNTED UPON ROCHALLOR HIS GREAT HORSE AND RODE FORTH ALONE AND NONE MIGHT RESTRAIN HIM HE PASSED OVER LIKE A WIND AMID THE DUST AND ALL THAT BEHELD HIS ONSET FLED IN AMAZE THINKING THAT OROM HIMSELF WAS COME FOR A GREAT MADNESS OF RAGE WAS UPON HIM SO THAT HIS EYES SHONE LIKE THE EYES OF THE ALAR THUS HE CAME ALONE TO SINGBAND S GATES AND HE SOUNDED HIS HORN AND SMOTE ONCE MORE UPON THE BRAZEN DOORS AND CHALLENGED MORGOTH TO COME FORTH TO SINGLE COMBAT AND MORGOTH CAME

SENDS CHILLS DOWN MY SPINE EVERY TIME I READ IT
TELL ME FRIEND WHEN DID SAURURAN THE WISE ABANDON REASON FOR MADNESS

ALWAYS LOVED THAT ONE QUICK WITTED AND TO THE POINT
ACRE ENTULUVA DAY SHALL COME AGAIN

IT'S TAKEN RATHER OUT OF CONTEXT AURIN SHOUTS THIS AS HE MAKES HIS FINAL STAND BEFORE BEING CAPTURED BUT I LIKE IT
ABOVE ALL SHADOWS RIDES THE SUN AND STARS FOREVER DWELL
I WILL NOT SAY THE DAY IS DONE NOR BID THE STARS FAREWELL


PART OF A SONG THAT SAM SINGS IN CRITH DUNGOL WHEN HE THINKS HE'S LOST FRODO I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE BOOK BUT NOT THE MOVIE
WORDS TO GANDALF AS THEY WALK OUTSIDE HIS HALLS AFTER SHUTTING HIMSELF AWAY FOR SO LONG

IT ISN'T SO DARK OUT HERE
IM A BIG FAN OF THORIN

I SPEAK TO THE MASTER OF THE MEN OF THE LAKE WILL YOU SEE THE PROPHECY FULFILLED WILL YOU SHARE IN THE GREAT WEALTH OF OUR PEOPLE
DO NOT SPOIL THE WONDER WITH HASTE

PERGOLAS TO GINGILI CONCERNING THE GLITTERING CAVES

REALLY LOVELY QUOTE
GOD DAMN YOU'RE ALL BRINGING THE FEELS I GOTTA REREAD
WHEN I FIRST RECEIVED THE LOAR BOOKS AS A GIFT AT YEARS OLD I HAD PICKED UP THE TWO TOWERS AND JUST STARTED READING THE BEGINNING OF IT FOR THE HELL OF IT AND LAMENT AS HE HEARD HORN HAS STUCK WITH ME TO THIS DAY ALAS AN ILL
FATE IS ON ME THIS DAY AND ALL THAT I DO
GOES AMISS WHERE IS SAM
REMOVED
WELL JUST OFF THE CUFF I THINK DOOM IS TO DEPART MIDDLE EARTH FOR ALIENOR WITH THE OTHER ELVES WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS TO ARAGON WHO AS SOMEONE IN THE LINEAGE OF ELROD WILL DIE AND DEPART FROM THE WORLD

AS FOR THE TREASURE WELL I THINK POSSIBLY THAT MIGHT BE ARWEN WHO IS GRANDDAUGHTER SINCE HE IS PLANNING TO DEPART FROM MIDDLE EARTH AND SHE TO REMAIN AS A MORTAL THEY WILL SOON BE PARTED FOR EVER I THINK HE'S SAYING HE HOPES THAT ARAGON WON'T HAVE TO SUFFER THAT PARTING THAT EVEN WHEN THEY DIE THEY WILL STILL BE TOGETHER ALTHOUGH THE ELVES DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO A MORTAL SOUL WHEN IT DIES
FROM JNR DRAFTS AND CHRISTOPHER NOTES IN SARON DEFEATED HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH

TZOLKIN WROTE AN EPILOGUE THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE FINAL PUBLISHED BOOK IT FEATURES A CONVERSATION BETWEEN SAM AND HIS DAUGHTER ELABOR SHE IS A YOUNG CHILD JUST OLD ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE HAVING HER FATHER READ THE RED BOOK BASICALLY THE LORD OF THE RINGS ITSELF TO HER AND THEY HAVE JUST FINISHED

THEY DISCUSS VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE STORY AT ONE POINT ELABOR MENTIONS FAREWELL TO ARAGON

I DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT FIRST WHAT CELEBORN MEANT WHEN HE SAID GOODBYE TO THE KING SHE SAID BUT I THINK I DO NOW HE KNEW THAT LADY ARWEN WOULD STAY BUT THAT GALADRIEL WOULD LEAVE HIM I THINK IT WAS VERY SAD FOR HIM AND FOR YOU DEAR HER HAND FELT FOR HIS AND HIS BROWN HAND CLASPED HER SLENDER FINGERS FOR YOUR TREASURE WENT TOO I AM GLAD FRODO OF THE RING SAW ME BUT I WISH I COULD REMEMBER SEEING HIM

SAM REPLIES AT LENGTH ON A FEW TOPICS THEN MENTIONS CELEBORN

I THINK CELEBORN IS STILL HAPPY AMONG HIS TREES IN AN ELVISH WAY HIS TIME HASN'T COME AND HE ISN'T TIRED OF HIS LAND YET WHEN HE IS TIRED HE CAN GO

SAM SAYS THIS ALONG WITH TELLING HER A SECRET HE'S NEVER TOLD ANYONE YET OR PUT IN THE BOOK THAT HE TOO WILL SOMEDAY GO TO THE HAVENS AND IT IS IMPLIED SEE FRODO AGAIN OVER THE SEA IN OTHER WORDS WHEN SAM IS READY HE TOO CAN GO LIKE CELEBORN

IN SHORT IT SEEMS THAT CELEBORN WAS REFERENCING HIS COMING SEPARATION FROM GALADRIEL HIS TREASURE IS GALADRIEL IS ARWEN WHETHER CELEBORN WAS HOPING ARWEN WOULD NOT DIE BEFORE ARAGON OR THAT SHE WOULD NOT DECIDE TO GO TO THE HAVENS AFTER ALL BEFORE ARAGON DIES I AM NOT SURE OR PERHAPS HE WAS HOPING ARWEN WOULD TRULY CHOOSE RECEIVE THE FATE OF MEN AND BE WITH ARAGON UNTIL THE END WHEREVER IT IS THAT MEN GO AFTER DEATH WHICH I ASSUME TZOLKIN BELIEVED WAS HEAVEN

THOUGH I SUSPECT THE SIMPLEST ANSWER IS THAT CELEBORN WAS THINKING ABOUT HIS IMMINENT LONG SEPARATION FROM GALADRIEL AND SAYING TO ARAGON MAY YOU NOT EXPERIENCE A LONG SEPARATION FROM YOUR WIFE
GALADRIEL LEFT ME BEFORE CELEBORN I THINK HE IS SAYING TO ARAGON HE HOPES ARWEN DOES NOT DEPART ME BEFORE HIM ARAGON
SOMEHOW I THINK THE FIRST PART OF THE STATEMENT DOESN'T REFER TO THE DOOM OF MANKIND

MAY YOUR DOOM BE OTHER THAN MINE HE IS SPEAKING AS THOUGH ARAGON HAS A CHOICE THAT THINGS CAN CHANGE HOWEVER SHOULDN'T HE ALREADY HAVE SOME FORM OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE FATE OF THE MAN BEING ONE OF THE OLDEST BEINGS IN THE 3RD AGE AND HAVING LIVED THROUGH THE TIMES OF THE 1ST AGE WITH ITS ACCUMULATED LORE AND KNOWLEDGE
DOOM HAS THE OLDER PROBABLY MORE CORRECT MEANING OF FATE NOT NECESSARILY A BAD FATE JUST ANY FATE TZOLKIN WOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS IF A MODERN AUDIENCE HAD LONG SINCE STOPPED USING THE WORD IN THAT CONTEXT
I THINK THE DOOM IS A REFERENCE TO THE ALAR AFTER THE WAR OF WRATH PROHIBITING THE LEADERS OF THE EXILES FROM RETURNING TO THE UNDYING LANDS SO AS ONE OF THOSE LEADERS GALADRIEL REMAINED AN EXILE IN MIDDLE-EARTH

THE TREASURE IS ARWEN AND HER CHOICE TO EITHER ENTER THE UNDYING LANDS OR TO BECOME HUMAN AND PASS BEYOND THE DOORS OF NIGHT
TZOLKIN USES DOOM IN THE OLDER SENSE MEANING FATE I THINK CRLEBORN IS REFERRING TO THE FADING OF LORIEN AS THE POWER OF THE RINGS DIES SO TREASURE IS FADING AND SO HE WISHES ARAGON A GOOD FUTURE WHERE THAT WHICH HE LOVES REMAINS BASICALLY HE'S WISHING HIM HOPE AND HAPPINESS
ALRIGHT EVERYONE'S COMMENTS ARE PRETTY DEEP INTERPRETATIONS BUT WHEN I READ IT I THOUGHT IT WAS WAY MORE SHALLOW SO I'M PROBABLY WRONG BUT HERE'S MY TWO CENTS DOOM IS THE SAME AS GLADRIEL AND THE REST OF LOTHLORIEN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ONE RING IF THE ONE IS DESTROYED RING IS ALSO USELESS AND SHE LOSES HER POWER THIS IS OF COURSE NOT THE DOOM BUT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE FOR ARAGON AND I THOUGHT THE TREASURE WAS ANDURÍL OR CONDOR OR ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH HIS KINGLY LINEAGE SORRY IF I SPELT NAMES WRONG IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER EXACT SPELLING
SINCE NO ONE HAS ANSWERED YET I WILL POST A TEMPORARY ANSWER THAT IS MY INTERPRETATION BUT IS PROBABLY WRONG HOPEFULLY EITHER A I AM RIGHT OR B SOMEONE ELSE HAS THE CORRECT ANSWER AND IT IS WAY COOLER
SO MY THOUGHTS ARE THAT GIFT TO MEN IS THEIR MORTALITY WHEN LIFE HAS AN END THERE IS MORE VALUE TO YOUR DAYS CELEBORN WILL LIVE FOREVER IN AMAN WHEREAS ARAGON HAS THE GIFT OF MORTALITY AND PERHAPS CELEBORN IS URGING HIM TO ENJOY THAT GIFT TILL THE END
AGAIN MOSTLY FOOD FOR THOUGHT AND ANY ERRORS I HAVE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM POINTED OUT I AM STILL LEARNING AS MUCH AS I CAN LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
NOBODY CAME OUT OF THERE ALIVE PERIOD THEY THOUGHT HE'D GONE IN THERE AS A LAST DITCH EFFORT AND HE'D THROWN HIS LIFE AWAY
BALDOR SON OF BEGO WENT INTO THE PATHS OF THE DEAD AND NEVER CAME BACK THE CORPSE ARAGON AND COMPANY FIND IS PROBABLY HIS BASICALLY THE SON OF A HISTORICAL KING WENT MISSING IN THAT PLACE

AND THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW OF WORDS AT THE STONE OF ERECH THERE IS ALSO A REAL FEAR EMANATING FROM THE PLACE AS EVERYONE BUT PERGOLAS IS TERRIFIED OF IT THE LOCALS PROBABLY FELT IT AS WELL AND RUMOUR WOULD SPREAD
THE ROHIRRIM WERE A RATHER SUPERSTITIOUS PEOPLE WITH LESS FORMAL EDUCATION ESPECIALLY IN THE ANCIENT HISTORY OF CONDOR CONSIDER HOW COMER VIEWS GALADRIEL THEY DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S GOING TO THE MOUNTAIN AND EVEN IF HE HAD EXPLAINED WHICH WOULD HAVE TAKEN AGES THEY PROBABLY WOULD STILL BE WRAPPED IN THEIR SUPERSTITIONS ABOUT THE HORRIFIC MOUNTAIN CIRC THEY AREN'T EVEN AWARE AT THIS POINT OF HIS SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE OTHER THAN A GREAT CAPTAIN OF THE NORTHERN DUNEDIN TO THEM HE HAS JUST WALKED IGNORANTLY INTO CERTAIN DOOM OF UNIMAGINABLE HORROR IN THE GREATEST HOUR OF NEED FOR ALL THE FREE PEOPLES OF THE WESTERN SHIT I'D BE DISMAYED TOO
THERE'S NO INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF LOAR FANDOM THAT SETS STANDARDS IF YOU THINK YOU'RE A FAN YOU'RE A FAN
YOU'RE STILL A FAN BUT A FAN OF THE MOVIES BUT PERHAPS JUST NOT OF READING LONG TALES YOU DIDN'T SPECIFY IF IT'S THE CONTENT OF THE BOOKS THAT YOU DON'T LIKE OR JUST THE HASSLE OF ACTUALLY READING IT I SUSPECT YOU ARE JUST MORE OF A VISUAL PERSON RATHER THAN A READER I SUSPECT SO BECAUSE THOSE THINGS YOU LOVE ABOUT THE MOVIES THEMES CHARACTER ARCS AND METAPHORS ARE ALL EXPOUNDED MUCH MORE IN THE BOOKS THAN IN THE MOVIES THERE IS MUCH MORE TO THINK ABOUT AND DISCUSS AND LOVE IN THE BOOKS THAN THE MOVIES YOU ARE NOT ALONE THOUGH THERE ARE MANY OTHERS LIKE THAT

PEOPLE WHO ARE FANS OF TZOLKIN USUALLY ADMIRE MORE THAN THE SUBJECT MATTER OF HIS TALE THEY LIKE HIS WRITING STYLE AS AN AUTHOR THIS IS WHAT KEEPS PEOPLE READING HIS WORK OVER AND OVER THE ACT OF READING IT IS ENJOYABLE THIS IS A SUBTLE BUT IMPORTANT POINT IF TZOLKIN WROTE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TALE IT WOULD STILL BE ENJOYABLE BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE WROTE

UNLIKE MARTIN TZOLKIN CONNECTS US TO THE STORY AND ITS CHARACTERS EMOTIONALLY VIA HIS GIFT WITH WORDS THROUGH READING YOU ARE INVESTED IN A MORE INTIMATE WAY THAN BY WATCHING THE MOVIES


WELL YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON A LOT OF SUBTLETY AND THEMES THAT EXIST IN THE BOOK WHICH WERE AXED FOR THE MOVIES YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON THE THINGS THAT TZOLKIN HIMSELF THOUGHT WERE VERY IMPORTANT AND IMHO YOU SHOULD STICK WITH THE BOOKS



BUT THERE'S NO RULE THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO BE A TZOLKIN FAN IN ORDER TO BE A FAN OF PETER MOVIES YOU LIKE WHAT YOU LIKE
YOU'RE A FAN OF JACKSON BUT NOT TZOLKIN
I THINK YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON SOME TRULY GREAT CONTENT LIKE THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE WHICH THE THIRD MOVIE OMITTED AND FOR ME REALLY CHANGED THE TONE OF THE ENDING YOU'RE ALSO MISSING OUT ON TOM BOBADIL BUT I CAN KIND OF TAKE OR LEAVE HIM EVEN IF HE FILLS A MINOR PLOT HOLE IN THE MOVIES
IF YOU'VE ONLY READ THROUGH OF THE BOOKS YOU REALLY SHOULD TRY AND GET THROUGH THEM THEY START SLOWLY BUT BY THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST BOOK IT REALLY PICKS UP INTO SOMETHING AMAZING I PROMISE GET AT LEAST THROUGH A JOURNEY IN THE DARK AND IF YOU STILL CAN'T BEAR IT THEN I WON'T HOLD IT AGAINST YOU BUT THEY DESERVE MORE THAN A FEW CHAPTERS
I'D CONSIDER YOU A FAN BUT I'D SAY YOU'RE ALSO MISSING OUT ON A LOT OF EXPANDED STORY IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE WORLD AND HOPE YOU COULD READ THE BOOKS ARE YOU A BIG READER ALSO DEPENDING ON YOUR AGE AND READING SKILL IT MAY BE HARDER TO GET INTO I FINALLY GOT TO THE SILMARILLION HOBBIT LOAR AND UNFINISHED TALES IN THE PAST YEARS I'M AND THE SILMARILLION KICKED MY BUTT AND LOAR HAD ME REREADING SECTIONS
OR MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT YOUR KIND OF BOOK EITHER WAY YOU'RE A FAN HAHA
IT'S A STRANGE PLACE TO BE I'LL GRANT YOU THAT NOT ALL OF LOAR IS EQUALLY SCINTILLATING I USUALLY SKIM OR SKIP ARAGON RECITING THE TALE OF BEDEN AND LUTHIER A LOT OF THE ENT POETRY REMAINS UNREAD I AM ASHAMED TO SAY I HAVEN'T YET FINISHED THE SILMARILLION BUT I'VE READ THE HOBBIT AND LOAR PROBABLY HALF A DOZEN TIMES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ORIGINAL STORY IN ADDITION TO PETER ALTERATION OF IT YOU DON'T KNOW THE CHARACTERS AS THEY WERE WRITTEN YOU KNOW THEM AS JACKSON AND THE SCREEN WRITERS REINTERPRETED THEM FOR A MODERN LARGELY TEEN AUDIENCE AND MUCH OF THEIR ORIGINAL POWER AND GRANDEUR HAS BEEN STRIPPED AWAY

PARTS OF THE MOVIES ARE BRILLIANT MOST OF THEM ARE AT LEAST GOOD NOT THE HOBBIT BUT WHATEVER SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIES ARE JUST WRONG AND BAD YOU SHOULD TRY TO PUNCH THROUGH THE BOOKS THEY'RE WORTH IT

ARE YOU YOUNG MAYBE WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE A LITTLE OLDER I KNOW THEY READ VERY DIFFERENTLY NOW IN MIDDLE AGE THAN THEY DID WHEN I WAS
TOM BOBADIL SILMARILLION
THE START OF FELLOWSHIP CAN BE HARD ON SOME BY THE TIME YOU'RE IN TWO TOWERS YOU CAN'T PUT THE BOOKS DOWN I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT ON THAT BOOK
YOU COULD ALWAYS TRY WHAT I DO AND LISTEN TO THE BOOKS IN AUDIOBOOK FORM AUDIBLE HAS BOTH AN UNABRIDGED VERSION AND A FEW ABRIDGED PERFORMANCES
THANKS FOR THE COMMENTS GOOD PEOPLE AND FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT TO TRY AGAIN WITH READING THE BOOKS
WHO CARES YOU LIKE WHAT YOU LIKE EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT IN THE MIND OF THE READER VIEWER WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BOOKS THE MOST HARD CORE TZOLKIN SCHOLAR COULD SCOFF AT THE BEST SCENE OF THE MOVIE COULD BE NOTHING BUT NOISE TO THE MOST ARDENT SCIFI FANTASY MOVIE FAN

AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT YOU FOUND SOMETHING YOU ENJOY WHO CARES WHAT MEDIUM IT IS PRESENTED IN AND WHO CARES WHAT ANYONE ELSE THINKS
I'D LOVE TO SEE A LOT MORE GO TO SCREEN PERSONALLY I WOULD PREFER IF IT STAYED OUT OF ANIMATION
I WANT IT AS A BALLET
THEIRS IS MY FAVORITE SUBSTORE IN THE LOAR UNIVERSE I WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS

IT COVERS THE STORY AND EVERYTHING WELL BUT THE VERSES THE WAY YOU SAY THEM IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO RHYME BUT NONE OF THEM DO REALLY TOOK MY OUT OF THE SONG
IT SOUNDS LIKE RAPPING BUT THERE'S NO RHYME SCHEME
THIS IS GOOD MAN NOT AS GOOD AS THE SNAPE ONE THOUGH I THINK THE ONLY THING STOPPING IT FROM BEING AS GOOD IS THE SOUND LEVELS THE MUSIC IS TO ME A BIT TOO OVERPOWERING AND YOUR VOICE KIND OF BLENDS INTO IT ALOT OF THE TIME

THE SNAPE VIDEO MADE ME CRY BY THE WAY BROUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES FROM THE WONDERFUL JOURNEY THE BOOKS AND THE FILMS TOOK ME ON KEEP MAKING THEM MANUAL
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL
THANK YOU FOR LEAVING ALL THE ARTISTS INFO THEY'RE ALL SO TALENTED I NEED A PRINT OF BEDEN CONFESSING HIS LOVE FOR LUTHIER AND NOW I CAN ASK
WONDER IF THE ARTISTS WOULD SELL BLOWN UP VERSIONS OF ONE OF THESE FOR A WALL IN MY ROOM THEY LOOK AMAZING
REMINDS ME OF THE COVER ART TO BLIND GUARDIAN'S ALBUM NIGHTFALL IN MIDDLE-EARTH IMPRESSIVE
THESE ARE AMAZING IVE SEEN A COUPLE BUT NOT ALL OF EM IT MAKES ME WANT TO HAVE A SILMARILLION GAME OR MOVIE EVERY TIME I READ SOMETHING RELATED TO IT I JUST WANT TO GET IMMERSED IN IT
IT'S STRANGE HOW THERE ISN'T ALOT OF ART DEPICTING FEASOR HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT CHARACTERS FROM THE SILMARILLION
THAT ELWYN LOOKS LIKE KATHERYN WINNICK FROM VIKINGS
THE ENT IS TERRIFYING
QUALITY POST BROTHER I HADN'T SEEN MANY OF THOSE AND THANKS FOR ALL THE RESEARCH IN CREDITING THE ARTISTS
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PAUL ART WOULD FIT VERY WELL IN THAT ALBUM
I ALWAYS FOUND IT FUNNY HOW THE BARONGS RUSHED IN TO SAVE MORGOTH WHEN HE WAS CAPTURED BY UNGOLIANT

IT'S LIKE THEY REALLY LOVED HIM OR SOMETHING AND IT'S JUST HARD TO IMAGINE A CREATURE LIKE A BARONG HAVING A SOFT SPOT FOR ANYBODY ESPECIALLY WHEN MORGOTH SHOWED HIS VULNERABILITY IN HIS INABILITY TO DEAL WITH UNGOLIANT


ANDED THERE'S THE BLIND GUARDIAN LYRICS M
OH WOW THAT GLAURUNG AT THE END IS AMAZING
THESE ARE INCREDIBLE I APPRECIATE THE ARTIST'S CREDITS ATTRIBUTED TO EACH PICTURE AND THE EXPLANATIONS
OH THIS IS A DAMN GOOD POST KUDOS TO YOU FOR THE COMPILATION
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS WHAT IS WANDERING MIND ABOUT
ALL OF THESE ARE MAGNIFICENT THEY MAKE ME WANT TO READ A COMIC VERSION OF THE SILMARILLION
HOLY SHIT I LOVE THAT CONCEPT FOR UNGOLIANT
HA I'VE BEEN USING THE STRIDER ILLUSTRATION AS MY CHARACTER'S PORTRAIT IN EVERY CRAG I'VE PLAYED THANK YOU JERRY MY LITTLE RANGERS ARE AWESOME BECAUSE OF YOUR WORK

GODDAMNIT NOW I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ALL OF THESE MAKE THEM MY WALLPAPER ON MY COMPUTER AND FEEL HAPPY ABOUT IT FOR FUCKS SAKE STOP MAKING AWESOME STUFF PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET IT MEANS I FEEL EMOTIONS

GOOD JOB OP
PLEASE TELL ME THERE IS SOMEPLACE I CAN BUY THIS

THEY LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL
SO MANY GREAT ONES HERE I JUST WISH EVERYONE WOULD STOP PUTTING PLATE ARMOR IN THEIR ARTICLE IT'S INACCURATE AND RUINS THE SETTING I CAN FORGIVE THE MOVIES BECAUSE FAKE PLATE IS A HUNDRED TIMES EASIER TO MAKE THAN FAKE MAIL BUT IF YOU'RE AN ARTIST JUST BE ACCURATE
REMINDED ME OF A COLLECTION I MADE A LONG TIME AGO THOUGHT ID SHARE HERE
SO I'VE NEVER READ THE BOOKS OR WATCHED THE MOVIES BUT LOOKING THROUGH THESE IMAGES I SEE A LOT OF STUFF I SAW IN THE TRAILERS OR SCREENSHOTS THAT GET POSTED FROM TIME TO TIME IS THIS JUST THE ARTISTS USING THE MOVIES AS REFERENCE OR ARE THE BOOKS JUST THAT GOOD AT DESCRIBING WHAT THE CHARACTERS AND SETTINGS LOOK LIKE THAT THEY SHOULD LOOK SIMILAR
THESE ARE AMAZING THANK YOU FOR SHARING
SOME OF THESE LOOK LIKE THEY COULD BE HEAVY METAL ALBUM COVERS
COLWYN WAS NOT TECHNICALLY A SHIELD-MAIDEN BUT SHE WANTED TO BE IT'S SOMEWHAT IMPLIED THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A SHIELD-MAIDEN IN A LONG TIME TOO THAT WAS MORE OF A FIRST AGE THING WHAT WITH DALETH AND ALL EVEN THEN I THINK FEMALE WARRIORS WERE VERY RARE
GREAT READ AND BEAUTIFUL ARTWORK QUALITY POST
ARTIST FOR
AWESOME I'M USING THESE TWO HETP AS MY PHONE WALLPAPER AND LOCK SCREEN
SOME TRULY AMAZING PIECES OF ART THERE THANKYOU FOR COMBINING THEM ALL TO ONE PLACE
VERY COOL ARTICLE THE CAPTIONS WERE SLIGHTLY INCORRECT IN SPOTS THOUGH
NEW BORN PORN BY INFANT ANNIHILATOR ONCE IT GETS TOWARD THE END WITH THE BABY SCREECHING I JUST FEEL SICK I CAN LISTEN TO UNHOLY GRAVEBIRTH FINE THOUGH
I HAVE TO ASK

ONE OF THE LORE DESCRIPTIONS IN THIS ALBUM STATED THAT SAM FOLLOWED FRODO AND BILBO INTO THE UNDYING LAND I'VE NEVER READ THE BOOKS SO CAN ANYONE CONFIRM THIS IN THE MOVIE AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER HE GETS MARRIED AND SETTLES DOWN IN THE SHIRE
THE IMAGE OF MORDOR LURKING IN THE BACKGROUND OF MINAS TIGRISH IS HAUNTING BRILLIANT ILLUSTRATIONS
WOW GREAT POST HERE IS SOME OF MY FAVORITE MIDDLE-EARTH ARTICLE

A ASS

SORRY I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GIVE CREDIT OR GIVE MORE DETAILS HOPE YOU ENJOY
THE FACT THAT ITS SLIGHTLY INACCURATE SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE

YOU MUST HAVE THE BEST F IN THE WORLD
OP IS NOW SINGLE DUE TO INACCURACIES
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE MAP IN FOREVER AND I'M ON MY PHONE WHAT PARTS ARE INACCURATE
PAINT OVER IT BUY HER A GOOD MAP AND MAKE HER DO IT AGAIN
HOW DID SHE REACT WHEN YOU TOLD HER
I WANT IT ON MY WALL INACCURATE OR NOT

THIS IS AWESOME AND ALSO SO CUTE THAT SHE DID THIS TO YOU
I LIKE IT
THATS AWESOME WHERE DID YOU GET IT

I NEED TO FIND ME A GIRLFRIEND LIKE THAT
GONNA SUCK HAVING TO PAINT OVER THAT WHEN YOU MOVE OUT
GANDALF CALLED IT NOT EVEN THE SEA IS SAFE

R TENGWAR
I BELIEVE ELBERETH GILTHONIEL HAS BEEN DONE IN TENGWAR CALLIGRAPHY MANY TIMES CHECK OUT GOOGLE IMAGES FOR A START LEARN THE LETTERS SO YOU CAN SEE WHICH STANZA THAT IS IT ISN'T THAT DIFFICULT THE VOWELS ARE THE TRICKIEST PART
I WILL ASK THERE THEN THANKS A LOT

CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HOW IT WAS MADE AND FUNCTION
THE HOBBIT WAS PUBLISHED IN AND IT WAS NOT YET COMPLETELY PART OF THE MIDDLE-EARTH LEGENDARIUM WHICH TZOLKIN KEPT WORKING ON HIS ENTIRE LIFE IT IS LESS SERIOUS AND MORE LIKE FAIRYTALE THAN LORD OF THE RINGS AND SOME OF HIS OTHER WRITINGS SOME THINGS MAY SEEM A BIT OUT OF PLACE BUT REMEMBER THAT THE HOBBIT IS WRITTEN BY BILBO HIMSELF AND MIGHT HAVE SOME EMBELLISHMENTS

NOW THE HOBBIT ALSO CONTAINS A BUNCH OF ELEMENTS THAT WERE INSPIRED BY NORSE GERMANIC MYTHOLOGY THE NAMES OF THE DWARVES FOR EXAMPLE COME FROM THE VÖLUSPÁ A POEM OF THE POETIC EDDA IN NORSE MYTHOLOGY ODIN HAD TWO RAVENS HUGIN AND HUGIN MEMORY AND THOUGHT WHO WENT OUT EVERY DAY TO COLLECT INFORMATION AND THEN TELL ODIN RAVENS IN EUROPEAN MYTHOLOGY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WISDOM THEY ARE EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT BIRDS LIKE MANY OTHER CHOROIDS AND ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH AS THEY WILL SCAVENGE DEAD PEOPLE ON A BATTLEFIELD FOR EXAMPLE

WIKI

IT WAS THE THRUSH THAT INFORMED BARD OF THE WEAK SPOT OF SMUG AND BARD CAN UNDERSTAND HIM BECAUSE HE IS OF THE RACE OF DALE AND DESCENDED FROM THE OLD KINGS IN A WAY BOTH THORIN OAKENSHIELD AND BARD THE BOWMAN ARE VARIATIONS ON THE KING UNDER THE MOUNTAIN FOLKTALES THAT EXIST IN MANY COUNTRIES EXAMPLES ARE KING ARTHUR AND FREDERICK BARBAROSSA BOTH ARE SAID TO RETURN WHEN BRITAIN OR GERMANY ARE IN NEED THERE ARE MANY LEGENDS IN EUROPE ABOUT THE RETURN OF THE KING AND WE SEE THAT OF COURSE AGAIN IN THE CASE OF ARAGON I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE SEEN THE LOAR MOVIES AS WELL SO MANY OF THE THINGS IN THE HOBBIT ARE MORE OR LESS INSPIRED BY EUROPEAN MYTHOLOGY AND TZOLKIN ALSO ADDED A FAIR DOSE OF FAIRYTALE BITS SUCH AS THE RUMOUR THAT THE BOOKS WERE DESCENDED FROM FAERIES FAERIES ARE NEVER MENTIONED ANYWHERE ELSE OR THAT THE OLD TOOK HAD A SHORT WITH MAGIC BUTTONS THAT COULD UNBUTTON THEMSELVES


BOTH THE EAGLES AND THE RAVENS PHYSICALLY SPEAK WITH THE DWARVES SO DOES THE THRUSH THAT MENTIONS WEAK SPOT TO BARD I THINK THE TEXT SAYS THAT BARD UNDERSTOOD THE THRUSH SINCE HE KNEW THE ANCIENT TONGUE OF DALE BUT I DON'T HAVE THE BOOK AT HAND
YES AND THEY'RE DEFINITELY INTELLIGENT CREATURES I THINK THEY'RE EVEN CLASSIFIED AS MAIA SIMILAR TO THE WIZARDS NOT ALL EAGLES ARE LIKE THE ONES IN THE HOBBIT THOUGH APOLOGIES FOR LIKELY BUTCHERING THE SPELLING GROUP IS AN EXCEPTION BUT IF I RECALL CORRECTLY OTHER EAGLES ARE NOT KNOWN FOR BEING NOBLE OR EVEN FRIENDLY

TOFFEE COVERED 2 AND

WHILE TZOLKIN LIKES TO LEAVE SOME MYSTERY THEY'RE DEFINITELY NOT ORDINARY CREATURES EITHER THE ONE IN THE HOBBIT IS SPEAKS IN COMMON SPEECH AND IS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS GOING ON EVEN MORE SO THAN THE DWARVES I'VE ONLY READ THE HOBBIT AND THE LOAR TRILOGY THOUGH MAYBE THERE IS MORE INFO ELSEWHERE

AT A FIRST READ IT SEEMS TO BE REFERRING TO FATE OR GRAND DESIGN NEVER THOUGH TOO MUCH ABOUT IT

HOLY SHIT MAN I HAD TO RE READ THAT LIKE TIMES I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE MOUNTED HIS DEAD CORPSE HIMSELF LOL LIKE SARON RAPED CELEBRIMBOR I WAS AT A LOSS OF WORDS FOR A FEW MINUTES
WHILE DEFINITELY NOT AS BLATANTLY CRUEL HIS FOULEST DEEDS HAVE TO BE THE CORRUPTION OF NOUMENON AND LATER THE CORRUPTION OF THE EASTERLING AND SOUTHRONS

ERU CREATED MEN AS HIS FAVORITE RACE GIVING THE FREEDOM OF FREE WILL IN THEIR LIVES IN MIDDLE EARTH AND TO CORRUPT HIS VISION OF MEN IS TO SPIT IN HIS FACE DIRECTLY
THE CORRUPTION OF NOUMENON AND THE TURNING OF THEIR WORSHIP TO MELIOR I WOULD SAY ALTHOUGH AT THAT POINT WAS ALREADY ON A VICIOUS PATH WHO KNOWS WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE ENDED UP EVEN WITHOUT DIRECT INFLUENCE
HE ONCE ATE THREE MEALS IN A ROW AT A PROTOTYPE BUFFET I'D CALL THAT A PRETTY FOUL FEED

HAVING HIS WEREWOLVES EAT SOLDIERS ONE BY ONE IN FRONT OF THE REST COUNTS AS A PRETTY FOUL DEED THOUGH
KAREN WYNN THE ATLAS OF MIDDLE-EARTH FITS SOME OF THE BILL IT'S BROKEN INTO SECTIONS FOR EACH AGE SOME HISTORY OF MAJOR EVENTS LOCATIONS PLENTY OF MAPS AND DIAGRAMS

IT'S AN EXTREMELY WELL RESPECTED BOOK BUT THE TWO VERSIONS I'M AWARE OF NEITHER WE LAID OUT IN A LANDSCAPE ORIENTATION
GO IN TIME ORDER

READ THE BOOKS WERE WRITTEN TO BE READ READ THEM COVER TO COVER FIRST YOU WILL FORGET SOME THINGS AND OCCASIONALLY BE CONFUSED THAT'S OK JUST READ STAY AWAY FROM WIKIS AND GOOGLE AND JUST EXPERIENCE THE BOOKS ON THEIR OWN TERMS

2 LISTEN TO AN AUDIOBOOK ONCE YOU HAVE THE STORY ARC DOWN YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE AUDIOBOOK WITHOUT FEAR ABOUT ZONING OUT AND LOSING THE STORY THE AUDIOBOOK ADDS THE DIMENSION OF HUMAN VOICE SO IT GIVES YOU A NEW WAY TO EXPERIENCE THE STORY YOU'LL HEAR AND NOTICE THINGS YOU DIDN'T ON YOUR FIRST READ THROUGH

WATCH THE MOVIES THE ACTORS COSTUMES SCENERY MUSIC WILL ALL ADD DEPTH AND ENHANCE YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THE STORY

DIG INTO THE APPENDICES LEGENDARIUM WIKIS ETC
THE BOOKS CAN DEFINITELY BE OVERWHELMING ON THE FIRST TRY TZOLKIN WAS POSSIBLY MORE INTERESTED IN THE LORE THAN THE NARRATIVE SO THERE ARE A LOT OF REFERENCES TO THINGS THAT ARE BARELY EXPLAINED BUT MOST AREN'T ALL THAT VITAL SOME PEOPLE SWEAR THAT READING THE WIKI WILL RUIN THE EXPERIENCE BUT I THINK AS LONG AS YOU DON'T DELVE TOO GREEDILY AND TOO DEEP INTO THE LORE YOU'LL BE FINE

I'D SAY READ THE NOVELS HOBBIT FIRST AND READ THE WIKI WHEN YOU FEEL YOU NEED IT I DEFINITELY LIKE USING A MAP TO HELP MAKE SENSE OF WHERE THEY ARE BUT THAT'S UP TO YOU SOME OF THE FIRST FEW APPENDICES IN ROK ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING TOO
PERSONALLY I READ THE HOBBIT FIRST THEN LORD OF THE RINGS THEN WATCHED THE MOVIES THEN READ THE SILMARILLION THEN MOVED ONTO THE OTHER BOOKS IT WAS PRETTY EASY TO DIGEST THIS WAY I HAD TO LARGELY IGNORE SOME OF THE REFERENCES FROM THE HOBBIT AND LORD OF THE RINGS IN ORDER TO NOT GET CONFUSED BUT OVER TIME THINGS MADE MORE AND MORE SENSE AND WHEN I READ THE OTHER BOOKS I MADE SENSE OF THE LORE BY FIGURING OUT THE CONNECTIONS TO THE TWO MAIN STORIES I EAST BEDEN AND LUTHIER ARE
DP
BASICALLY FRODO INHERITS THE ENEMY'S SARON WEAPON ONE RING FROM BILBO WHO FOUND IT UNDER A MOUNTAIN AND WITH HIS GARDENER SAM THEY GO TO MOUNT DOOM TO DESTROY IT IT IS CORRUPTING AND MUST BE DESTROYED THEY SET OFF WITH SEVEN COMPANIONS UNTIL THEY SEPARATE AT THE RIVER ALNUIN FRODO DECIDED THE BURDEN TO DESTROY THE RING SHOULD BE ON HIM THEY ARE GUIDED AFTERWARDS BY OLD ENEMY GOLLUM WHO CAME UPON THEM IN MORIA AND FOLLOWED THEM SINCE WHO POSSESSED THE RING PRIOR TO BILBO HIS FRIEND DÉAGOL FOUND IT IN THE ALNUIN HUNDREDS OF YEARS EARLIER AFTER THE 2ND KING OF CONDOR ISILDUR LOST IT THERE

THE BEST SOURCE OF LORE FOR LOAR ARE THE BOOKS THEMSELVES THE APPENDICES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DÚNEDAIN ELROD THEY ARE CONNECTED BROTHER ELROD WAS THE FIRST KING OF THE DÚNEDAIN THE DWARVES AND THE ROHIRRIM
READ THE BOOKS FIRST THE HOBBIT THEN THE LORD OF THE RINGS THERE ARE ONLY CHARACTERS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO HOLD IN MIND DON'T WORRY ABOUT TRYING TO REMEMBER ALL THE PLACE NAMES OR LORE READ IT FIRST AS A SIMPLE STORY TAKING IN JUST THE BASIC PLOT AND WRITING STYLE

ON SUBSEQUENT YOU WILL START TO WIDEN YOUR OWN COMPREHENSION

THINK OF IT LIKE MOVING TO A NEW CITY FIRST FEW DAYS YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GET A FEEL FOR LEARNING THE MAJOR ROUTES TO THE SUPERMARKET AND POST OFFICE AS TIME GOES BY YOU'LL HAVE TIME TO DRIVE AROUND AND EXPLORE THE HIDDEN ROADS AND PARKS
HOW I GOT INTO IT IS I WATCHED THE MOVIES THEN READ THE HOBBIT THEN THE SILMARILLION AND THEN LOAR ITSELF AS FINISHER I LIKED IT THE WAY I DID BECAUSE THE BOOKS HAVE MORE CONTENT THAN THE MOVIES AND I THINK LOAR IS MOST ENJOYABLE IF YOU KNOW WHATS BEHIND IT SO TO SAY
I'D START WITH THE SILMARILLION
HIS LOGO
IT IS A LOGO THAT IS ALSO EMPLOYED BY SAURURAN AS THE WHITE HAND ORCS WEAR IT ON THEIR SHIELDS AND WORE A WHITE HAND

AND SUDDENLY HE FELT THE EYE THERE WAS AN EYE IN THE DARK TOWER THAT DID NOT SLEEP HE KNEW THAT IT HAD BECOME AWARE OF HIS GAZE A FIERCE EAGER WILL WAS THERE IT LEAPED TOWARDS HIM ALMOST LIKE A FINGER HE FELT IT SEARCH FOR HIM VERY SOON IT WOULD NAIL HIM DOWN KNOW JUST EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS AMON CHAW IT TOUCHED IT GLANCED UPON TOL BRANDER THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP

TAKE THIS EXAMPLE I WOULD SAY IT WAS THE WILL OF SARON WORKING WITH THE ALWAYS SEARCHING BEREGOND SPEAKS ABOUT A SIMILAR PRACTICE WITH DENETHOR AND HIS CONFRONTATIONS WITH SARON
THE GIST I GOT FROM READING THE BOOKS WAS THAT THE EYE OF SARON IS TWO THINGS

THE STANDARD HIS ORCS CARRIED INTO BATTLE

2 THE PRESENCE SARON WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN IN MIDDLE EARTH WITHOUT HIS RING THAT'S WHAT ALLOWED HIM TO REBUILD HIS ARMIES AND BEGIN TO TERRORIZE MIDDLE EARTH AGAIN
A HERALDIC DEICED USED ON SHIELDS AND FLAGS DENOTING ALLEGIANCE TO SARON

OTHER HERALDRY USED IN THE BOOKS

WHITE TREE SEVEN STARS AND A CROWN ON A SABLE OF ELENDIL

WHITE HORSE ON A GREEN FIELD HOUSE OF CEORL

WHITE HAND SAURURAN

BLACK SERPENT ON A RED FIELD ARAD

SILVER SWANS ON A BLUE FIELD DOL AGOROTH

PLAIN WHITE WITH NO OF THE STEWARDS
IT'S AN ANALOGY
CAN SOMEONE QUICKLY SUM UP MIDDLE HISTORY

TOM BOBADIL SINGS WHILE A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF HAPPENS OUTSIDE THE OLD FOREST
NO GUYS I GOT THIS

SO BASICALLY THERE WAS THE FIRE IN SOME MASSIVE PRIMORDIAL VOID RIGHT THIS DUDE ILUVATAR SNATCHES THAT UP AND USES THE FIRE TO CREATE LIFE SO HE MAKES A BUNCH OF SUPER POWERFUL PEOPLE AND THEY ALL GET HYPE ABOUT EXISTENCE AND START SINGING ALLEGEDLY THIS SINGING IS LIKE THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE SO THIS GUY MELIOR HE DOESN'T LIKE THE SONG SO HE STARTS SINGING SOME OTHER SONG THESE SONGS MIX AND CREATE DISHARMONY GOD'S LIKE MPH STILL GOT A SICK BASS DROP AND CARRIES ON AND THEN SENDS THE HE MADE OR LIKE SOME OF THEM TO THIS PLACE ERU CREATED AND ALLOWS THEM TO SHAPE IT AS THEY WOULD

SO THE ALAR AKA GOD PEOPLE START MAKING MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS AND WHAT NOT BUT STILL KIND OF SALTY THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE COMPLETE POWER OVER EVERYTHING AND HE STARTS SCREWING WITH THE PLANET MAKING NASTY BITS AND BAD PLACES AND WHATNOT

SO ANYWAY THIS GOES ON FOR A BIT AND THEN MELIOR REALLY STARTS FUCKING SHIT UP HE GOES AND STEALS SILMARILS MURDERS HIS DAD AND PROMPTS FEASOR TO SWEAR A DUMBASS OATH TO GOD BASICALLY THAT HE AND ALL OF HIS KIN WILL NEVER STOP SEARCHING FOR THE SILMARILS AT ANY COST THIS HAS SOME PRETTY SHIT CONSEQUENCES AND ALSO MELIOR BROKE BOTH THE MASSIVE LAMPS LIGHTING THE PLANET AND HAD UNGOLIANT THE GIANT SPIDER BITCH KILL THE TWO TREES IN ALIENOR WHICH REALLY PISSED EVERYONE OFFICIAL

SO YEAH THE FIRST AGE IS A BIT OF A SHITSHOW AFTER MELIOR BREAKS THE LAMPS AND THE TREES THE SUN AND MOON IS CREATED BY THE ALAR TONS OF SHIT HAPPENS AFTER THIS BUT ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS EVENTUALLY THE ALAR SEND THEIR EXTREMELY MIGHTY FORCES TO MIDDLE EARTH AND SHITSTOMP MORGOTH CASTING HIM INTO THE VOID THIS REALLY SCREWS UP MIDDLE EARTH THOUGH AND THE SECOND AGE THAT FOLLOWS IS PRETTY NASTY ESPECIALLY SINCE SARON SECOND IN COMMAND STILL IS CHILLING IN MIDDLE EARTH THE ALAR DON'T WANT TO GO BACK AND STOP HIM SINCE LAST TIME THEY DID IT REALLY FUCKED UP THE PLANET AND ALSO THEY WANTED THE ELVES AND MEN TO DO IT THEMSELVES

SARON IS A GIANT ASSHOLE AND THE SECOND AGE ISN'T VERY FUN FOR ANYONE HE TRICKS THE ELVES INTO MAKING THE RINGS OF POWER AND ALSO CONVINCES THE NUMENOREANS TO NOT ONLY SPARE HIS LIFE AFTER THEY COME TO FUCK HIM UP BUT THEY ACTUALLY START LISTENING TO HIM AND FALL INTO MELIOR WORSHIP EVENTUALLY HE HAS THEM ATTACK ALIENOR WHICH IS A BAD IDEA AND HE GETS SUNK ALONG WITH THE REST OF THEM BY GOD

SO HE SCUTTLES BACK TO MIDDLE EARTH AND SEES THAT THINGS ARE GETTING A BIT TOO FREE AND NICE OVER THERE AND STARTS A WAR AGAINST THE FREE FOLK IN AN ATTEMPT TO CURB THEIR RISING POWER HE SUCCEEDS IN CORRUPTING MANY KINGS OF MEN WITH HIS RINGS AND EVENTUALLY THE WAR ENDS IN THE LAST ALLIANCE WHERE SARON GETS HIS SHIT WRECKED AND LOSES HIS ONE RING THUS USHERING IN THE THIRD AGE AND A WATCHFUL PEACE TO ENSURE SARON DOESN'T DO ANYMORE EVIL SHIT

OF COURSE HE DOES BUT YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT THAT IN THE MAIN BOOKS
THE AINU CREATE ARDA
MELIOR ONE OF THE AINU GOES MAD AND STARTS DESTROYING STUFF
TALUKAS AND HIS FRIENDS FIGHT MELIOR AND THEY WIN
THE ELVES AWAKE AND GO TO ALIENOR
SOME ELVES GO MAD AN THEY GO BACK TO MIDDLE EARTH
THERE ARE MANY FIGHTS AND THE MEN APPEAR SOMEWHERE
SOME MEN GO TO NÚMENOR
NÚMENOR MEN GO MAD AND RETURN TO MIDDLE EARTH
SARON MAKES A RING HE WAS ALREADY MAD
ISILDUR GOES EVEN MORE MAD AND STEALS THE RING
FRODO DESTROYS THE RING SPOILER
THE ELVES STOP BEING MAD AND RETURN TO ALIENOR

SO AS YOU CAN SEE MIDDLE HISTORY IS FULL OF MADNESS

NO REALLY A QUICK AND SHORT SUM OF ITS HISTORY IS IMPOSSIBLE IN MY OPINION I HAVE ONLY TALKED ABOUT MEN ELVES AND AINU BUT I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE DWARFS THE ANTS THE ORCS AND THE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF ELVES NOLUDAR PINDAR AND OF COURSE I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT DETAILS AND HOW THE EXACTLY WENT MAD WHICH IS THE INTERESTING PART

I RECOMMEND THESE TWO SITES

THE TZOLKIN GATEWAY
THE ONE WIKI TO RULE THEM ALL

AND OF COURSE THE SILMARILLION AND THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH BOOKS ARE THE BEST WAY
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE OF THE ACTUAL HISTORY TRY READING THE SILMARILLION OF THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH BOOKS
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ISN'T REALLY A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE TO ACTUAL READING THE ANCILLARY TEXTS THE SILMARILLION WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO START
IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY INTERESTED THE BEST WAY TO START IS TO READ THE SILMARILLION THESE CHAPTER SUMMARIES CAN HELP YOU THROUGH IT

I WILL KEEP IT ON THE SITE LONGER THEN SO YOU GET THE CHANCE UNTIL NEXT WEEKEND
A OLD POEM WRITTEN BY TZOLKIN AND ONLY PUBLISHED ONCE OR TWICE INITIALLY PUBLISHED IN THE WELSH REVIEW VOLUME IV NUMBER AND TRANSLATED INTO SERBIAN IN WITH A TINY PRINT RUN SEE HERE FOR ADDITIONAL INFO ON THE SERBIAN EDITION AND IT'S 2ND EDITION

IT IS PROBABLY BEST TO THINK IF IT IN A SIMILAR STYLE TO THE STORY OF KULLERVO THE FALL OF ARTHUR OR THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDREN SHORT STORY TRANSLATION WITH LOTS OF COMMENTARY THIS LOOKS TO BE NO EXCEPTION AS IT'S A VERSE POEM THE ORIGINAL PUBLICATION IN THE A5 WELSH REVIEW ONLY TOOK UP PAGES

I'VE SEEN POSTED IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT IN ADDITION TO THE TEXT THE BOOK WILL CONTAIN AT LEAST COMMENTARIES

INTRODUCTION BY BERLYN FLIEGER
2 PREFATORY NOTE ON THE TEXT BY CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN
TZOLKIN S CORRIGAN POEMS

ALSO PULLED THIS FROM A BURIED PART IN S LISTING
THIS POEM TELLS THE TRAGIC STORY OF A LORD WHO SACRIFICES HIS LIFE BY LOVE IN ORDER TO HAVE A CHILD WITH HIS WIFE THEN TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO HIS SPOUSE HE GIVES HIS LIFE TO A WITCH THE J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN ESTATE WEBSITE
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE TRACKS TOO I THINK IT DOESN'T GET MUCH ATTENTION BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE IT DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO THE ACTUAL FILM EXCEPT MAYBE THE CREDITS
SADLY ALMOST ALL THE NEW ORIGINAL THEMES WRITTEN FOR BILBO WERE REPLACED BY THE OLD HOBBIT THEMES FROM LOAR
ALL OF THE MUSIC IN THE HOBBIT FILMS WAS GOOD AS WELL AS THE ACTORS THE ISSUE WAS THE TIME CONSTRAINT ON PETER JACKSON TO GET THE FILM OUT WHICH CAUSED ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS ALL THE DAMN CGI TOO OF COURSE
WOW THAT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY GOOD
AND I WAS EVEN COMPARING IT TO THE SHIRE THEMES FROM THE LOAR SOUNDTRACK
I THOUGHT WE AS A SOCIETY SURPASSED THINKING BEING NERDY IS A NEGATIVE TRAIT LOL

IF YOUR FRIENDS GENUINELY ENJOY FILMS THEY ARE DEFINITELY MISSING OUT IT'S QUITE THE VISUAL SPECTACLE
WELL AS YOU SAY YOU CAN'T FORCE THEM TO AND NAGGING IS NOT LIKELY TO MAKE THEM MORE WILLING IT'S THEIR LOSS IS THERE A LOCAL CLUB OR SOME OTHER PLACE WHERE YOU COULD MEET PEOPLE WHO ALREADY LIKE IT
THIS ANSWER MIGHT NOT SO POPULAR BUT GET SOME OF THE GOOD OL GANJA SHUT THE LIGHTS LIGHT UP SOME FOREST SCENTED INCENSE BLAST THE VOLUME SOME GOOD SNACKS

OTHERWISE DON'T MAKE SOMEONE WATCH SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO THEY WILL PROBABLY DISLIKE IT EVEN MORE BECAUSE THEY WERE FORCED MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS THEIR IDEA


MY DAD WATCHED IT WHEN HE SAW THE BOX OFFICE NUMBERS
I DONT SEE WHATS NERDY ABOUT WATCHING A MOVIE IT MAY BE NERDY IF YOU DIV E DEEP INTO THE BACKSTORY OF EVERYTHING
IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE A HORRIBLE WAY TO DO IT BUT JUST CONSTANTLY PESTER THEM NOT TOO MUCH BUT ANY TIME THE TOPIC OF MOVIES COMES UP TALK ABOUT LOAR EVENTUALLY THEY WILL WHERE DOWN AT LEAST MY FRIENDS ALWAYS DO
I GOT A COUPLE FRIENDS OF MINE TO WATCH THE INDIANA JONES TRILOGY WITH ME BY CONVINCING THEM JUST TO WATCH THE FIRST ONE I TOLD THEM I THOUGHT THEY SHOULD GIVE IT A CHANCE AND IF THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT I WOULD NEVER ASK THEM TO WATCH THE OTHER TWO
START SMALL FIND SOME DOWN TIME AND ARRANGE TO JUST WATCH THE THEATRICAL VERSION OF MORE IF THEY LIKE IT AND WANT TO PRESS ON THEN YOU'VE GOT THEM HOOKED DO THEY WATCH GAME OF THRONES REMIND THEM THAT THEY'RE SIMILAR
THAT'S FUCKING DOPE DUDE
DID YOU SWITCH CHARACTERS WITHOUT BUYING FELLOWSHIP UPGRADES
DWARVES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME OF THE ELEVEN SMITHS OF THE FIRST AGE AND BEFORE LIKE FEASOR
FROM THE SILMARILLION

THEIR SMITHCRAFT INDEED THE PINDAR SOON LEARNED OF THEM YET IN THE TEMPERING OF STEEL ALONE OF ALL CRAFTS THE DWARVES WERE NEVER OUTMATCHED EVEN BY THE NOLUDAR AND IN THE MAKING OF MAIL OF LINKED RINGS WHICH WAS FIRST CONTRIVED BY THE SMITHS OF BELEGOST THEIR WORK HAD NO RIVAL
DANG I DIDN'T LOOK AT THE SUB NAME AND THOUGHT I WAS IN R ELDERSCROLLS AND I WAS ABOUT TO COME IN HERE AND HAVE A BRAWL WITH SOME OF ALL
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A BIT OF INHERENT BIAS IN THIS QUESTION LIKE OTHERS SAID THE DWARVES TO LIKELY THE BETTER CRAFTSMAN BEING CREATION AND ALL AND THE ELVES LEARNED THE CRAFT FROM THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE

BUT WITH THE DWARVES GENERAL BEHAVIOR MOSTLY STAYING TO THEMSELVES IN THEIR MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLDS AND BEING FAR LESS INVOLVED IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN AND ELVES WE SEE MUCH LESS OF THEIR CRAFT IN ACTION

WHEREAS IN THE SILMARILLION AND LOAR WE ARE MOSTLY FOLLOWING THE STORIES OF MEN AND ELVES WHO'S WEAPONS ARE THE ONES WE REMEMBER WHOSE NAMES ARE LISTED AMONG THE GREATS AND THE DWARVES AND THEIR GREAT WEAPONS MAKE MUCH LESS OF AN APPEARANCE SO GLAMOURING AND STING AND ORCRIST AND ANGLACHEL GURTHANG AND ANGUINEAL ETC WERE ALL SWORDS MADE BY MEN AND ELVES AND WE HEAR MUCH OF THEM AND THEIR DEEDS

THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE DWARVES MADE NOTHING OF NOTE THEY MADE GARSIL THE NECKLACE NAUGLAMIR AND THE DRAGON HELM OF BUT BECAUSE OF WHO WE ARE READING ABOUT THEY ARE MENTIONED MUCH LESS SO IN A OF FAMOUS CRAFTWORK THE DWARVES WOULD SEEM TO FALL SHORT OF THE ELVES AND MAYBE EVEN OF MEN EVEN THOUGH THEY WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE THE BETTER SMITHS AND CRAFTSMEN
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TWO CONCEPTS ARE EVEN SEPARABLE IN TZOLKIN THE ELVES SPECIALISED IN ENCHANTMENT AND THE DWARVES SPECIALISED IN CRAFTSMANSHIP THERE ARE NEVER ANY SPECIAL PROPERTIES ATTRIBUTED TO DWARVES CRAFTS BUT MEANWHILE A MERE SIDE ARM LIKE STING IS ENCHANTED TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF ORCS AND IS CAPABLE OF PIERCING THE EXOSKELETON OF GIANT SPIDERS EVEN WHEN WIELDED BY A MERE HOBBIT

I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION THAT ELDEN ARMS AND ARMOUR ARE SUPERIOR TO EVERYTHING ELSE MADE IN MIDDLE EARTH AS GOOD AS DWARVES CRAFTS ARE THEY'RE STILL MUNDANE
I FEEL LIKE IN GENERAL DWARVES ARE SUPERIOR TO ELVES BUT THE BEST ELVES WERE FAR SUPERIOR TO THE BEST DWARVES I ALSO FEEL LIKE THEY MADE INHERENTLY DIFFERENT WEAPONS AND ARMOR DWARVES FOCUSING ON HEAVY ARMOR AND ELVES ON LIGHT ARMOR
THE ELVES MADE SOME AWESOME SPECIAL WEAPONS THOUGH GLAMOURING GANDALF ANDRUIL ARAGON AND ORCRIST THORIN WERE MADE BY ELVES
PUT IT THIS WAY THE ARMOUR OF THE DWARVES OF BELEGOST WAS SO GOOD THAT THEY WHERE IMMUNE TO DRAGON FIRE DURING THE WAR OF THE JEWELS THE ARMY OF BELEGOST LITERALLY WALKED UP TO GLAURUNG AND HIS FIRE BREATHING BROOD AND DROVE THEM AWAY I THINK THAT ALONE SHOWS JUST HOW GOOD DWARVES ARMOUR IS

AS FOR THEIR WEAPONS DWARVES OF BELEGOST TRADED THEIR STEEL WEAPONS WITH THE PINDAR THE QUALITY OF WHICH WAS SAID TO BE INCOMPARABLE

DWARVES ARE THE BEST SMITHS WHEN IT COMES TO WEAPONS ARMOUR AND NORMAL FUNCTIONAL ITEMS THE ELVES ARE GOOD AT MAKING LIGHTER ARMOUR AND MAGICAL ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE THE SILMARILS AND THA PALANTIRI ALTHOUGH BOTH OF THOSE WHERE MADE BY FEASOR
THEY DON'T ALWAYS HIT THE MARK WITH THE FACES


SHOP FIGURES REF SEARCH
LOOKS LIKE SACHA BARON COHEN AS FRODO
THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER THAN THAT JEEZ
LOOKS MORE LIKE WEYOUN
THEY NAILED COLWYN
AMAZING VERY LUCK INDEED
I PICKED UP THE PERGOLAS BUST FROM A GARAGE SALE LAST WEEK IT'S A LITTLE FREAKY
I HAVE BOTH AND HONESTLY THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION LOOKS BEAUTIFUL ON THE SHELF AND IS GREAT WHEN YOU HAVE AN ARMCHAIR AND READING TABLE AVAILABLE THE PAPERBACK EDITIONS ARE FOR WEARING AND TEARING TRAVEL MAKING NOTES UNDERLINING ETC

IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE WHOLE TRILOGY IN ONE VOLUME BUT IT'S NOT THE LEAST BIT PRACTICAL A BIT LIKE COLLECTED WORKS LOOKS GREAT ON THE SHELF BUT IF YOU'RE PUTTING ON A PLAY AND PLAN TO BRING THE SCRIPT WITH YOU DEFINITELY GET SEPARATE PAPERBACKS COMMON ROOKIE MISTAKE
THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION IS MY PREFERENCE MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE GORGEOUS ILLUSTRATIONS BY ALAN LEE I DON'T BELIEVE THE BOXED SET HAS ANY ILLUSTRATIONS NORMALLY I DON'T CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT ILLUSTRATIONS IN BOOKS BUT ALAN ARE SUPERB AND REALLY ADD TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND WORLD BUILDING

WEIGHT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE BUT THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY DOWNSIDE TO THE ANNIVERSARY
I HAVE THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION AND IT IS DEFINITELY OF HIGH QUALITY AND GOOD FOR THE PRICE IT'S NICE TO HAVE IT ALL IN ONE VOLUME BUT IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON READING AT ALL I WOULD GET THE BOX SET AS THE ONE VOLUME CAN BE QUITE CUMBERSOME
FOR ME PERSONALLY I CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT OF CARRYING AROUND A BOOK THAT BIG I'D DEFINITELY GO WITH THE BOX SET PLUS I LOVE THE DESIGN ON THOSE
IF YOU'RE GETTING THAT EDITION OF THE SILMARILLION GET THE BOXED SET MARINER BOOKS HOUGHTON MIFFLIN HARCOURT RELEASED THE BOXED SET AS WELL AS THE SILMARILLION AND UNFINISHED TALES IN THOSE NEAT SOLID BLACK WITH SINGLE COLOR DETAIL BOOKS AND THEY LOOK GREAT AS A COMPLETE SET
NEAT
NICE WORK BUT I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU THAT YOU SEEM TO HAVE USED THIS IMAGE AS YOUR BASELINE RATHER THAN THE IMAGE FROM LOAR ITSELF

WHOEVER MADE THE ONE YOU USED DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO USE TENGWAR PROPERLY AND JUST TYPED THE TRANSLATED TEXT IN ENGLISH AND SWAPPED TO A TENGWAR FONT THIS DOES NOT WORK AT LEAST IT ISN'T ON A TATTOO
NICE ALSO UNVOTED FOR NOT BEING THE RING VERSE OR SOME CRAPPY TENGWAR TRANSLITERATION
FUCKING SWEET DUDE
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS FROM THE SIL THAT I THINK WOULD TRANSLATE WELL INTO FILM OR TV I HAVE GREAT IMAGES IN MY HEAD OF THIS
LOOKS REAL NICE I LIKE IT
THEY DO JUST A LITTLE BUT THE BIG AGING EFFECT WOULD NOT HAPPEN UNTIL THE RING IS DESTROYED


YOU ARE EXPECTING IT BECAUSE OF HOW OLD BILBO LOOKS IN RIVENDELL YES BUT THE MOVIE SIMPLY GETS THAT WRONG
ISN'T THIS EXPLAINED IN THE BOOKS
THE RING BEING IN EXISTENCE IS WHAT KEEPS GOLLUM AND BILBO ESSENTIALLY NOT AGE IN THE MOVIE BILBO SHOULDN'T HAVE AGED MUCH BETWEEN RIVENDELL AND HIS DEPARTURE BUT THE END OF ROK IS PRETTY ACCURATE SINCE THE RING IS GONE
RIGHT HE WAS LIKE HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD AS SOON AS HE LOST THE RING HE IMMEDIATELY CRUMBLED INTO DUST
SO FIRST OF ALL DURING THE WAR OF THE LAST ALLIANCE ELVES WERE PRETTY STRONG STILL AND SARON WAS PROPORTIONALLY WAY WEAKER THAN HE WAS IN LATE THIRD AGE AFNOR NORTHERN KINGDOM AND CONDOR SOUTHERN KINGDOM WERE FORMER NÚMENOREAN COLONIES OF THESE TWO IT SEEMS AFNOR WAS WAY STRONGER IN THE BEGINNING

DURING THE FIRST MILLENIA OF THE THIRD AGE AFNOR BECAME WEAKER AND WEAKER AND CONDOR BECAME MIGHTIER AND MIGHTIER UNTIL IT WAS PRACTICALLY A SUPERPOWER DUE TO INTERNAL DISPUTES AFNOR WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE REALMS WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES SARON MANAGED TO SLOWLY DESTROY ALL THE THREE SUCCESSOR KINGDOMS OF AFNOR NORTHERN DÚNEDAIN WERE PRETTY MUCH DONE FOR

ALSO DURING THE THIRD AGE THE ELVES SLOWLY LEAVE MIDDLE-EARTH AND IS ABANDONED BY THE DWARVES THANKS TO BARONG AND DRAGONS DESTROY MANY DWARVES STRONGHOLDS AND THEY HAVE TO WAGE A MASSIVE WAR AGAINST ORCS ALSO CONDOR ALSO STARTS TO WEAKEN ALTHOUGH IT WAS ONCE PROBABLY THE MOST POWERFUL REALM IN ENTIRE MIDDLE-EARTH THERE IS A BLOODY CIVIL WAR KNOWN AS CONDOR IS UNDER ATTACK ON TWO FRONTS AGAINST HARADRIM EASTERLING WAINRIDERS BALCHOTH AND VARIAG OF HAND GREAT PLAGUE KILL MUCH OF ITS POPULATION AND CONTINUOUS WARS AGAINST CORSAIRS DESCENDANTS OF THE LOOSING SIDE OF CIVIL WAR DEPLETE STRENGTH UNTIL IT IS MUCH LIKE BYZANTIUM WAS IN ITS LATER YEARS

CONDOR IS DEFINITELY NOT LULLED INTO THINKING THERE IS NO REAL THREAT TO IT IT HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY IN WAR OF SOME SCALE FOR MANY CENTURIES

ALSO DURING THE SIEGE OF MINAS TIGRISH AND THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR FIELDS CONDOR WAS UNDER ATTACK ON THE TOTAL LENGTH OF ITS SOUTHERN BORDER BY HARADRIM AND CORSAIRS MAJORITY OF SOUTHERN FORCES WERE BOUND TO DEFEND THE SOUTHERN FLANK CONDOR MIGHT HAVE HAD AROUND RELATIVELY PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS IN ENTIRETY BUT COULD NOT SEND THEM ALL TO MINAS TIGRISH WE DO NOT HAVE EXACT NUMBERS ANYWHERE BUT THERE ARE SOME ESTIMATIONS AND I PERSONALLY THINK THAT IS REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS AND IS PROBABLY PRETTY ACCURATE WITH SOME MARGIN OF ERROR OF COURSE
AS YOU MAY HAVE GATHERED THE LAST WAR ENDED LONG AGO NO ONE IS CONCERNED WITH THE QUIETLY GROWING THREAT ANYMORE CONDOR AND ROHAN DISPATCH LITTLE GROUPS OF ORCS BUT THAT'S IT THERE IS NO VAST FORTRESS CRAWLING WITH EVIL FORCES TO HANDLE THAT THEY KNOW OF SO NOBODY IS PREPARED WHEN THEY SUDDENLY COME OUT OF NOWHERE AND SAY THERE'S A MASSIVE ARMY ON THE WAY TO KILL EVERYONE

KEEPING YOUR NUMBERS UP IS SOMETHING YOU DO WHEN THERE IS A KNOWN ENEMY TO FACE BUT WHEN THE WAR IS OVER AND THE GRAND ENEMY IS DEAD THERE'S NO REASON TO ATTEMPT TO REPOPULATE SO QUICKLY THE SOLDIERS YOU HAVE TAKE CARE OF THE LITTLE BUGGERS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF INSERT ANY FREE PEOPLE'S TOWN HOME HERE THE REST OF THE PEOPLE LIVE QUIET LITTLE LIVES

SARON BUILT UP HIS FORCES FOR YEARS BEHIND THE CLOSED GATES OF MORDOR QUIETLY BEFORE UNLEASHING THEM AND SAURURAN USED HONESTLY WEIRD UNKNOWN BREEDING ABILITIES TO RAPIDLY POPULATE A VAST POWERFUL ARMY IF ANYONE HAD SEEN WHAT WAS HAPPENING THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER PREPARED ALAS THEY WERE TOO COMFORTABLE AND THEIR LEADERS WERE WEAK
MAYBE YOU REGROUPED THE TILES FIRST MADE THE TEXT POP A LOT MORE
MADE
WHAT WHAT DOES IT MEAN
DOES SHE KNOW YOU MADE IT
MAYBE COULD SPENT THAT TIME CLEANING UP THE PLACE INSTEAD
OH MY GOD YOU RUINED HER BEAUTIFUL KITCHEN
THAT LOOKS LIKE ELDER FUKARTH WHY ARE YOU POSTING IT IN HERE
BOTH TEXTS ARE ENGLISH TRANSLITERATED INTO WHAT I THINK ARE THE ANGERTHAS ERECTOR ABOVE AND THE ORTHOGRAPHIC SPELLING OF THE ENGLISH MODE OF THE TENGWAR BELOW I MIGHT BE WRONG ABOUT THE SPECIFIC MODES THOUGH

THE UPPER TEXT TRANSLATES TO THERE AND BACK AGAIN A TALE WITHOUT THE CAPITALIZATION AND PUNCTUATION OF COURSE
THAT IS I THINK THE NAME BILBO GIVES HIS MEMOIRS IN THE MOVIE VERSION

THE LOWER TEXT SEEMS TO BE AN EXCERPT FROM THE SPEECH BILBO GIVES AT HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY ALSO THE MOVIE VERSION IS THE TEXT SCROLLING OR CHANGING BETWEEN MENUS BY ANY CHANCE BECAUSE IT CUTS OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SENTENCE
IT READS YEARS IS FAR TOO SHORT A TIME TO LIVE AMONG SUCH EXCELLENT AND ADMIRABLE HOBBITS I DON'T KNOW HALF
IT SHOULD THEN CONTINUE OF YOU HALF AS WELL AS I SHOULD LIKE AND I LIKE LESS THAN HALF OF YOU HALF AS WELL AS YOU DESERVE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDED TO HIM IN THE FLESH SARON HAS A BODY WHEN GANDALF WAS IN DOL GOULDER HE SAID SARON HAS TAKEN SHAPE AGAIN AND NOW GROWS APACE AND HE IS GATHERING AGAIN ALL THE RINGS TO HIS HAND OF THE RINGS OF POWER AND THE THIRD AGE HE'S HAD A BODY FOR A GOOD LONG WHILE

JUST BECAUSE SAURURAN WAS THE WHITE HAND BY THE WHITE HAND THE DID NOT MEAN HE WAS SOME PALE HAND WALKING AROUND LIKE IN THE ADDAMS FAMILY SARON BEGAN TO GROW AGAIN DURING THE REIGN OF THE KING OF CONDOR TELEMNAR FROM OUT OF THE EAST HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE SOUTH OF KIRKWOOD AND

SLOWLY HE GREW AND TOOK SHAPE THERE AGAIN AND IN A DARK HILL HE MADE HIS DWELLING AND WROUGHT THERE HIS SORCERY OF THE AND THE THIRD AGE

IN THE BLACK GATE IS CLOSED GOLLUM RECALLS SARON AND SHUDDERS

IT WAS ISILDUR WHO CUT OFF THE FINGER OF THE ENEMY

YES HE HAS ONLY FOUR ON THE BLACK HAND BUT THEY ARE ENOUGH SAID GOLLUM SHUDDERING THE BLACK GATE IS CLOSED
AS AN ASIDE IN THE BOOK SARON HAD A BODY AND HE WAS NOT A FLOATING EYE SARON KEPT THE NINE RINGS OF THE NAZGÛL HIMSELF AND THAT IS HOW HE CONTROLS THEM AFTER HE LOST THE ONE RING SINCE HE HOLDS THEIR RINGS THE NINE ARE COMPLETELY ENSLAVED TO HIM GOLLUM MET SARON IN PERSON AND HE SAYS SARON ONLY HAS NINE FINGERS ISILDUR CUT OFF THE RING

TZOLKIN ALSO MENTIONS IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS I CAN'T COME UP WITH THE PRECISE QUOTE THAT NO MORTAL COULD WITHHOLD THE ONE RING FROM SARON IN HIS PRESENCE

SO YEAH MY GUESS IS THAT THEY WOULD EITHER TAKE THE RING OR THE RINGBARKER AND THE RING AND GO BACK TO SARON

THEIR PLAN AT FEATHERTOP WAS TO STAB FRODO WITH THE AND HE WOULD TURN INTO A WRAITH UNDER CONTROL OF THE NAZGÛL BUT HOBBITS ARE MORE RESILIENT THAN THEY EXPECTED
EVEN WITH THE UBIQUITOUS EYE OF SARON DEPICTED IN THE FILMS I THOUGHT IT WAS ALWAYS PRETTY OBVIOUS FROM THE DIALOGUE THAT SARON HAD A PHYSICAL FORM HE WAS JUST NOT READY TO MANIFEST HIMSELF UNTIL HE GOT THE RING BACK
I'D SAY IT'S A COMBINATION OF THE MOVIE MAKING IT SEEM LIKE A MORE DIFFICULT DASH TO MAKE UNSEEN FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT AND THE HOBBITS REALLY NOT HAVING A PLAN THEY KNEW THEY HAD TO GET TO MORDOR BUT THEY THOUGHT THE GATE WAS THE ONLY WAY SO THEY HAD TO TRY EVEN IF IT WAS A SLIM CHANCE

THOUGH I DO KIND OF AGREE THEY'D HAVE ALMOST NO CHANCE I FEEL LIKE THE COUNCIL OF ELROD SHOULD HAVE SPENT MORE THOUGHT ON SPECIFICALLY HOW TO GET INTO MORDOR BEFORE SENDING THE FELLOWSHIP OFFICIAL
ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BOOK OR IN THE MOVIE

I THINK THAT IN THE BOOK TZOLKIN HAS THEM CONFRONT THE GATE IN ORDER TO MAKE AGREEING WITH PLAN TO GO THE DARK AND SECRET WAY PLAUSIBLE PRESUMABLY JACKSON DOES THE SAME THOUGH GOLLUM SMEAGOL IS MORE AGREEABLE AT THIS POINT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT EVEN FRODO MUCH LESS SAM WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED GOLLUM INTO A DARK TUNNEL UNLESS HE TRULY BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY
THE HOBBITS TENDED TO GO UNNOTICED IN MOST INSTANCES UNLESS THEY MADE THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN OR WERE WITH OTHERS THEY WERE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD AT PASSING UNSEEN

THIS IS EXACTLY WHY BILBO MADE SUCH A GOOD BURGLAR IN THE BOOKS HE MANAGES TO GET IN AND OUT OF ERECTOR COMPLETELY INVISIBLY THE ONLY REASON SMUG KNOWS HE HAD GOTTEN IN IS BECAUSE HE TOOK SOMETHING

THEY PROBABLY JUST THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD RUN UNSEEN THROUGH THE GATE IF NO ONE WAS LOOKING FOR THEM IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THEY COULD HAVE MADE IT THROUGH
IMO THE MOVIES REALLY HAD DIFFICULTY WITH GETTING A HANDLE ON JUST HOW BIG MORDOR WAS ANYWAYS AND THAT INCLUDES THE AREA AROUND THE GATE
EXACTLY THEY DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT TO GET THAT FAR AND I'M SURE THEY FELT PRETTY SNEAKY AFTER DASHING PAST A GROUP OF AT AMON HENRY HOBBITS SOMETIMES AREN'T THE BRIGHTEST SPECIFICALLY FRODO
HAVE YOU SEEN ALL THE MOVIES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T

FRODO IS FAIRLY CERTAIN HE IS FATED TO MAKE IT INTO MORDOR HE HAS FAITH AND HE'S WILLING TO TAKE INSANE CHANCES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN BECAUSE ALL ENTRANCES ARE GUARDED IF YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIES I CAN SAY MORE
IT WAS A SWORD
NOT REALLY FLUSHED OUT TOO WELL IN THE HOBBIT BUT THERE IS A THEME RUNNING THROUGH THE BOOKS WHERE POTENCY POWER AND SKILL SEEM TO FADE AS THE AGES PASS IN MIDDLE EARTH THIS THEME IS PROBABLY MOST EVIDENT IN THE SILMARILLION

IN THE AGE THAT ORCRIST WAS MADE THE ELVES WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR POWER ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES OF TRADE IN GOODS AND EXCHANGE OF SKILLS BETWEEN DWARVES AND ELVES SO IT IS REASONABLE TO CONSIDER SOME DWARFISH INFLUENCE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

FURTHER REMOVING THE NEED OF DWARFISH SKILL ALTOGETHER WE HAVE ELVES WHO DEPARTED WERE EXILED FROM ALIENOR WHO ESSENTIALLY HAD 1ST GENERATION KNOWLEDGE TRAINING TUTELAGE FROM ABLE PRETTY MUCH THE GOD OF FORGING SMITHING AND WHAT NOT WHEREAS THORIN CO DID NOT
HELLO AGAIN ORCRIST AND GLAMOURING WERE BOTH FORGED BY THE NOLUDAR IN THE FIRST AGE AS GANDALF SAID IN ADJ CONSIDERING THAT THE TWO SWORDS WERE MADE FOR TURGOR THE KING OF GONDOLIER AND THE FACT THAT THE NOLUDAR WERE FAVOURITE ELVES AND MANY LEARNED DIRECTLY FROM HIM WE CAN SAFELY ASSUME THAT THEY'RE SOME OF THE BEST SWORDS IN MIDDLE-EARTH DURING THE THIRD AGE THE SWORD THORIN USES ISN'T NAMED OR FOCUSED ON AT ALL SO WE CAN ASSUME THAT IT'S A PRETTY GENERIC RUN OF THE MILL DWARVES SWORD
STUFF LIKE THAT IS WHY WE'LL NEVER GET SILMARILLION MOVIES
THIS WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD
THIS GAVE ME A GOOD CHUCKLE AND I ALWAYS WONDERED THESE THINGS TOO
DAMN NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFERENT DIRECTION THE ARROWS CAME FROM
THAT'S A GREAT FIND HAVE YOU READ IT YET I LOVE THOSE LETTERS
DEFINITELY READ IT THIS WINTER IT'S GREAT
I USED TO OWN THAT LITTLE BOOK THEY'RE GREAT THEY'RE ONLY A SMALL SELECTION OF THE LETTERS TZOLKIN WROTE AS FATHER CHRISTMAS TO HIS KIDS THOUGH I WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING THE BIGGER BOOK WITH THEM ALL IN
I LOVE HIS FATHER CHRISTMAS LETTERS MY DAD USED TO READ THEM TO ME EVERY YEAR WHEN I WAS LITTLE LOTS OF FUN
MY FAVOURITE THING HE DID OUTSIDE OF THE MIDDLE EARTH STUFF
A CUSTOM COMMISSION DONE BY A MY GIRL'S SISTER
I WANT YOUR SHIRT

I AM THAT GUY
I WISH THIS IS WHAT THE EYE HAD LOOKED LIKE RATHER THAN BEING A LIGHTHOUSE
THE KIND THAT ARE TOO STONED TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WEARING
R BADLANDS
FRONT PAGE BABY
SHOP TEKEDYE REF
THIS IS OF COURSE GIVING HUGE RESPECT TO HOWARD SHORE
P DID A PHENOMENAL JOB AT CREATING MASTERFUL MOVIES HE ALSO DID A GREAT JOB WITH THE ADAPTATION OF COURSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE THINGS THAT PULL YOU OUT OF YOUR SUSPENDED DISBELIEF AS HAVE ALL MOVIES TSH AND AS BOOK FANS EVEN MAKE YOU WINCE A BIT BUT STILL THE MOVIES WERE INCREDIBLY WELL MADE
I TOTALLY AGREE ESPECIALLY SINCE HE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT IF DESCRIPTION TO WORK WITH IN LOAR TZOLKIN DOESN'T GIVE A LOT OF EXPOSITION ON WHAT PEOPLE AND PLACES LOOK LIKE AT LEAST NOT ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH AS HE DID WHEN WRITING THE HOBBIT HE GAVE VERY BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS AND LET THE MIND FILL IN THE BLANKS I'M NOT SAYING THAT IS A BAD THING MIND YOU JUST THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT FAIRLY DIFFICULT TO ADAPT TO ON SCREEN VISUALS WHILE STAYING TRUE TO THE SOURCE TEXT
THE LORD OF THE RINGS PROVED ONE THING NOTHING WAS
I REALLY CAN'T WATCH THE BATTLES WITHOUT NOTING HOW STUPID SOME MOVES ARE PERHAPS P MADE THEM ENTERTAINING FOR LARGE CROWDS
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK WHAT BOOK IS THIS BASED ON AGAIN
WHAT YEAR IS THIS FROM

AND I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE TO TAKE SOME CREATIVE LIBERTIES BECAUSE OF THE TIME LIMIT BUT WOW DID THEY EVEN READ THE BOOK
VERY NICE I PERSONALLY LIKE THE RUST ON THE SWORD AS IT GIVES A LITTLE COLOR TO THE WORK
THIS IS GREAT BUT I WAS STILL GROGGY THIS MORNING WHEN I READ THE POST AND THOUGHT AT FIRST IT SAID NAGUAL FARTED ON ME
THIS IS A GREAT IMPRESSIONISTIC WORK I LIKE THAT IT'S NOT JUST A DIRECT ITERATION BUT HAS SOME DETAIL WORK THAT WAS YOUR OWN INTERPRETATION I LOVE THE GAUNTLETS AND THE HOOD GREAT STUFF
THIS IS EXCELLENT I'M REALLY LIKE THE GAUNTLETS AND IF YOU JUST WENT LIGHTER OR DIDN'T INCLUDE THE RUST ON THE BLADE IT WOULD BE GOOD
I REALLY LIKE THE NEW TAKE ON RUST BEING ON THE GAUNTLETS BLADE WAS IT JUST FOR A COLOR POP OR WAS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON WHY A NAGUAL SPECIFICALLY

I PERSONALLY REALLY LIKE THE NAGUAL THEY'RE SOME OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS IN THE LOAR UNIVERSE SO IT'S ALWAYS COOL TO SEE THEM HERE
ASW MAN GAUNTLET PORN LOVE IT
I REALLY REALLY LOVE HOW GRITTY AND UNFINISHED THIS IS WHILE I APPRECIATE ARTISTS THAT CREATE ALMOST ART I LOVE SEEING THE BRUSH STROKES AND THE WHOLE PROCESS OF HOW YOU MADE IT PLUS I FEEL IT LENDS TO THE SUBJECT AS WELL NAGUAL AREN'T ESSENTIALLY ALL THERE THEY'RE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD I FEEL NOT CREATING FINITE LINES WITH THIS ADDS TO WHAT A NAGUAL REALLY IS
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I READ THAT AS NAGUAL FART
AWESOME JOB MAN I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU ATTEMPT SOME TURIN TURAMBAR IN HIS DWARVES MASK IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT
NOT A FAN OF THE SWORD BUT OTHERWISE IT'S GOOD I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE RUST ON HIM
STUNNING
I LIKE THIS WEBSITE
THERE ARE MANY GOOD LOAR WALLPAPERS THERE
THIS
HAVING DONE SEVERAL OF ALL SIX FILMS EXTENDED I WOULD SAY THAT WHEN YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE INEVITABLE PAUSES BETWEEN MOVIES FOR BATHROOM BREAKS AND THE GRABBING OF SNACKS YOU'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT ABOUT EXACTLY HOURS
END TO END INCLUDING CREDITS BUT NOT FAN CLUB CREDITS WHICH ADDS ANOTHER MINUTES ALL SIX EXTENDED ADD UP TO HRS AND MINUTES
I WOULD SAY ROUGHLY HR RUNNING TIME
I'D SAY BETWEEN AND HOURS
FUN FACT THE TEAR WASN'T SCRIPTED
THE FACT THAT IT'S A RELATIVELY LONG SHOT LEADING INTO THE REVEAL IS PERFECT
BEAUTIFUL
THERE ARE MANY FOOLS OF THE BOOKS
THE SCENE IN QUESTION
TOO MANY BOOKS
YOU WIN ALL THE KARMA

AT A GLANCE IT LOOKS LIKE THE SCENE AT HELMS DEEP WITH THE ELVES
A BALLISTA WOULD PROBABLY TEAR A TENDON AT LEAST IF THEY COULD MOUNT THEM ONTO CHARIOTS THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO WRAP THEM AROUND LIKE FROM STAR WARS

ARROWS AREN'T COMPLETELY USELESS PERGOLAS USES TO INSTANT KILL ONE IN THE BRAIN ALSO I REMEMBER A SOLDIER THROWING A SPEAR INTO A JOINT AND THAT BROUGHT THE LEG DOWN

I ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE THE RIDERS ON THE OLIPHAUNTS WERE A BIGGER THREAT THAN THE BEASTS ALTHOUGH THE HORSE CHARGE WAS PROBABLY A STUPID THING TO DO
THANKS
THAT LOOKS LIKE IF GOLLUM HAD BABY
THAT'S REALLY COOL CONGRATS
BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE THEM BOOST IN POLITICAL AND MILITARY POWER THEY COULD USE THE RING AGAINST SARON HOW EFFECTIVELY IS SOMEWHAT OPEN TO DEBATE BUT AT LEAST THEY COULD PUT UP FAR TOUGHER FIGHT ELROD GALADRIEL OR PERHAPS EVEN ARAGON MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASSEMBLE THEIR OWN EMPIRES WITH THE HELP OF THE RING THEY WOULD BECOME MILITARY AND POLITICAL POWERHOUSES AND MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO DEFEAT SARON

THE RING GIVES THE ABILITY TO CONTROL AND DOMINATE OTHER MINDS SO THAT THEY BECOME YOUR SERVANTS SLAVES WITH THE RING ARAGON OR GANDALF MIGHT HAVE DEFEATED SARON BUT IT WOULD BE LIKE NAZIS AND SOVIETS FIGHTING WHO EVER IS THE VICTOR JUST BECOMES THE NEW DARK LORD

USING THE RING AGAINST SARON FACE-TO-FACE ONLY GANDALF MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEFEAT HIM BUT AT LEAST ELROD AND GALADRIEL AND MAYBE ARAGON MIGHT HAVE DEFEATED SARON INDIRECTLY BY DESTROYING HIS POLITICAL POWER

BY THE WAY FARAMIR PERHAPS WAS ATTRACTED TO THE RING BUT PUT UP WITH THE TEMPTATION AND DID NOT TRY TO TAKE THE RING FROM FRODO MOVIES PORTRAY HIM WRONG ALSO ONLY FEW MEN WERE EVEN AWARE OF THE RING EVEN FARAMIR ALTHOUGH ABLE TO READ ANCIENT TEXTS FROM THE ARCHIVES AND WHO WAS INTERESTED OF ANCIENT LORE AND HAD IN FACT READ FAIR SHARE OF IT WAS NOT VERY INFORMED ABOUT THE RING
I HAVE OFTEN MYSELF QUESTIONED WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN HAD ONE OF THEM USED THE RING AND DEFEATED SARON AS HE USED A PORTION OF HIS OWN LIFE FORCE TO CREATE THE RING WOULD IT'S WEARER SIMPLY THEN JUST BECOME THE NEW EMBODIMENT OF SARON OR WOULD THEY JUST BE CORRUPTED BY THE RING AND MADE EVIL STILL REMAINING ESSENTIALLY THEMSELVES

WITH BODY ALREADY DESTROYED WHAT WAS THE ACTUAL PLAN FOR THE RING IF SARON HAD CAPTURED IT WOULD IT HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE WITCH KING OF INGMAR ESSENTIALLY MAKING HIM THE NEW SARON OR WAS THERE SOME WAY TO ACTUALLY RECREATE BODY USING THE RING OR MAYBE SIMPLY A BODY OF FLAME SIMILAR TO THE EYE I MEAN SARON IS BASICALLY A NECROMANCER WOULD HE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REBUILD OR REANIMATED HIS BODY SOMEHOW
ABSOLUTELY NOT
NUMBER I REALLY THINK THE P FILMS ARE THE DEFINITIVE FILMED VERSION I DOUBT THEY COULD DO BETTER IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME SAD TO REALIZE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IN MY LIFETIME DIFFERENT PEOPLE WILL BE CAST AS THE CHARACTERS AND THE SERIES REBOOTED FOR THE BIG SCREEN
IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY COULD EVER INCLUDE STUFF LIKE TOM BOBADIL

IT ALSO MIGHT ALSO FOR SOME OF THE SONGS TO MAKE THEIR WAY INTO CREDIT MUSIC LIKE IN GOT

ALSO SOME OF THE CHARACTERS MAY ACTUALLY GET TO BE PORTRAYED AS THEY DESERVE EAST G FARAMIR AND DENSTHOR
IF THEY DID LOAR AS A TV SHOW THEY COULD PACE IT PROPERLY AND INCLUDE SCENES LIKE THE BARROW DOWNS AND THE FIRST MEETING WITH THE ELVES WITHOUT HAVING TO CUT FOR SO YES I WOULD QUITE LIKE THAT
ABSOLUTELY WHILE I LOVE PJ'S TRILOGY THE SOURCE MATERIAL COULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED BETTER

SOMEONE POSTED THIS LAST WEEK IN REGARDS TO DOING THE SILMARILLION BUT THE AUTHOR ALSO DID SEASONS FOR LOAR BUT THIS IS A PRETTY OUTLINE FOR DOING LOAR AS A SEASON EPISODIC FORMAT

CATEGORY
I'D BE BEHIND IT BUT ONLY IF THE PRODUCTION VALUE IS THERE LIKE GOT THE MOVIES BEING TOO RECENT HOWEVER I WOULDN'T EVEN SEE THIS AS A VIABLE OPTION UNTIL THE COPYRIGHT RUNS OUT ON THE LOAR ESTATE WHICH IS IN I THINK SO AFTER THAT WE MIGHT SEE SOMETHING OF THE LIKE
NO BUT I THINK THE SILMARILLION COULD WORK WELL IN A EPISODIC FORMAT
IT'S CROSSED MY MIND MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT HOW GREAT IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE IF LOAR COULD GET THE GAME OF THRONES TREATMENT FROM HBO JUST THINK THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE THINGS UP SIMPLY BECAUSE THE AUTHOR HADN'T FINISHED WRITING IT YET OR WORSE BECAUSE THE PRODUCERS THOUGHT THEY KNEW BETTER THAN THE AUTHOR IMAGINE A EPISODE FOR EVERY CHAPTER OF LOAR WITH THE KIND OF PRODUCTION QUALITY THAT HBO IS FAMOUS FOR
YES BUT THEN I WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO START IT ALL THE WAY BACK IN THE FIRST AGE AND COVER EVERYTHING WHICH MEANS IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE ANIMATED SO YOU COULD DO CHARACTER AGING PROPERLY
YES IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN BUT A OR HOUR MINISERIES WOULD BE GREAT TAKE THE TIME TO TELL IT RIGHT LESS CUT OUT THE COMEDY TELL IT AS THE GRINDING WAR STORY THAT IT IS
GANDALF MORE OR LESS SAYS HE IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PERSON IN MIDDLE-EARTH ASIDE FROM THE DARK LORD SO I GUESS HE IMPLIES THAT SARON IS STRONGER

GANDALF ALSO STRUGGLES WITH SARON FROM A DISTANCE WHEN FRODO IS ON AMON HENRY HE DOESN'T WIN OR LOSE BUT GIVES FRODO THE TIME TO MAKE HIS OWN CHOICE AFTER THAT HE SAYS HE WAS EXHAUSTED AND WANDERED LONG IN DARK THOUGHT

THEN THERE IS THE THING IN SOME OF STORIES WHERE WHEN TWO VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE FIGHT THEY BOTH DIE IT HAPPENS AT LEAST THREE TIMES WITH BARONGS VS OTHER POWERFUL PEOPLE AND IT HAPPENS WHEN ELENDIL AND FIGHT SARON
THIS JUST SEEMS LIKE A POPULARITY CONTEST
THE SILMARILLION WAS KIND OF A TOUGH READ BUT I'M GLAD I GOT THROUGH IT IT MADE THE CHILDREN OF AURIN BETTER AND AFTER READING LOAR AFTERWARDS I UNDERSTOOD MORE OF THE REFERENCES LOAR HAS REKINDLED MY FASCINATION WITH TOM BOBADIL SO I THINK I'M ON TO TALES FROM THE PERILOUS REALM NEXT
ARE THOSE FAT VOLUMES ON THE LEFT HOME
KILL THE CAMERAMAN WOMAN
I THINK IT'S FITTING THAT THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN WITH A
WOW COOL YOU GOT TO MEET SEAN ASTIN AND MICHAEL J FOX IN THE SAME DAY
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE THE BLURRY PICTURE OUR VOLUNTEER PHOTOGRAPHER WAS LESS THAN GIFTED COOL TIME THOUGH

I'M THE ONE IN RED ON THE LEFT
I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE ASK SEAN TO CARRY THEM
HE ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE THE NICEST GUY
IT'S SAD YOU ONLY HAD A POTATO AND NOT A CAMERA
WHAT'S THE STORY HERE I'M GETTING A COMMUNITY THEATRE VIBE
SHARE THE LOOOOAAADDDD
I LIKE TO ERR ON THE SIDE THAT THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN WITH A
HEY I'M IN THERE YELLOW SHIRT IN THE BACK
BUT BUT WHY TAKE A PHOTO WITH A POTATO

HE'S A PRETTY NICE GUY
SHARE THE MOCHA
REMINDS ME OF WHEN MY FRIEND SAID BRO I'M GREAT AT TAKING PICTURES AND I GOT TO MEET ONE OF MY HEROES CHINO FROM THE BAND DEFTNESS AND MY FRIEND TOOK THE PICTURE I CAME HOME TO FIND AN IMAGE THAT LOOKS LIKE SASQUATCH FOOTAGE

WHATEVER THOUGH THE MOMENT LIVES IN MY MEMORY
CAMERA'S PRECIOUS NUMBER TATERS BOIL EM MASH EM TAKE A PIC OR TWO
GOT TO MEET HIM AT A CON IN PORTLAND OREGON A COUPLE YEARS BACK HE WAS SUPER SWEET CHATTED WITH MY WIFE AND I FOR ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES AS WE WERE THE LAST PEOPLE OF THE DAY
HE'S OFFERING TO HELP SHARE THE LOAD
SEEMS LIKE SUCH A DAD
WHY DO SO MANY POSTS START WITH THE WORD SO
IS HE PREGNANT
REMOVED
THIS IS NOT LOAR RELATED
THE ORCS STOPPED DROPPING PIPPIN ONTO THE HARD DIRT MERRY WASN'T MOVING THE ORCS RAN INTO THE SAUROBUCKS OF THE ROHAN PLAINS AND FORCED A DOUBLE SHOT ESPRESSO DOWN HIS THROAT HE CHOKED BUT IN MOMENTS WAS STANDING WEARY BUT DEFIANT
I'D LIKE TO ECHO ALL THE OTHER COMMENTS AND MAKE ONE MORE POINT

GANDALF NEVER SPEAKS OF THINGS THAT HE HIMSELF HAS NOT PERSONALLY VERIFIED I THINK THAT'S A SUPER IMPORTANT THEME IN THE NOVELS EYE-WITNESS VERIFICATION HE HAS SUSPICIONS BUT KEEPS THEM MOSTLY TO HIMSELF HE NEVER SPEAKS OF THE RING AS THE ONE RING UNTIL HE READS THE WORDS INSCRIBED UPON IT HIMSELF HE DOES NOT ADVOCATE FOR TRAVELING THROUGH MORIA EXCEPT AS AN OPPORTUNITY BORN OF NEED BOTH ARAGON AND GANDALF SUSPECT MORIA HOLDS AN ANCIENT EVIL BUT NEITHER OF THEM SPECULATE OPENLY

I LOVE THAT ABOUT CHARACTER EVEN IN SIMPLE SITUATIONS HE WILL NOT CLAIM KNOWLEDGE THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE REGARDLESS OF OBVIOUS CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WHEN HE TALKS TO BILBO AFTER THE PARTY BILBO SAYS WELL I GUESS YOU KNOW BEST AND GANDALF RESPONDS I DO WHEN I KNOW ANYTHING

AND TO FRODO LONG AFTER BILBO DEPARTS ABOUT THE RING KNOW I DON'T KNOW THERE IS ONE FINAL TEST TO BE MADE

HE EVEN SCOLDS WORM-TONGUED LIE THAT WORD COMES TOO EASILY FROM YOUR TONGUE I DON'T LIE THE WISE SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT THEY KNOW

GANDALF DOESN'T SPECULATE OPENLY AND HE NEVER PRESENTS ANYTHING AS FACT THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW FROM PERSONAL OBSERVATION COUNTLESS MORE EXAMPLES FROM THE TEXT ELUDE MY MEMORY

EDIT I THOUGHT OF ANOTHER ONE THE PALANTIRS OF ORTHANT AND MINAS TIGRISH EVEN AFTER WORM-TONGUED CHUCKS THE PALANTIR AT GANDALF AND PIPPIN RECOVERS IT GANDALF STILL SAYS THAT HE IS NOT SURE HOW ISENGARD AND MORDOR EXCHANGED NEWS ONLY AFTER PIPPIN LOOKS IN THE STONE DOES GANDALF SAY THAT HIS SUSPICION IS CONFIRMED THIS IS ECHOED BY THE PALANTIR OF MINAS TIGRISH IN BOTH CASES GANDALF MUST HAVE KNOWN WELL AS HE WOULD SAY SUSPECTED BUT HE NEVER STATES AS FACT HIS SUSPICIONS UNTIL HE CONFIRMS THEM IN PERSON

ALSO AND SECONDARILY THE DWARVES ARE NOT TASK IN MIDDLE-EARTH HE'S MUCH BUSIER WITH THE ISSUE OF SARON AND THE RING AND HIS BUSINESS WAS MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THOUGH THE KNEW NOTHING OF THAT

NOTE ALL QUOTES OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND MAY DEVIATE SLIGHTLY FROM THE ACTUAL TEXT
THE DWARVES WERE AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF MORIA NO WARNING FROM GANDALF NEEDED
WHAT WARNING COULD GANDALF HAVE GIVEN BALIN HE DIDN'T KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SITUATION IN MORIA THAN THE DWARVES DID
GANDALF WAS IN THE DARK ABOUT MORIA JUST LIKE BALIN NOTHING HE COULD SAY THAT BALIN DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW
THANKS JUST TO CLARIFY I DID MEAN SPECIFICALLY BURINS BANE I KNOW BALIN AND CO WOULD BE AWARE OF THE ORCS DESIRE FOR THE STRATEGIC LOCATION PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS THEY WENT THERE OTHER THAN ESTABLISHING A WIDER KINGDOM BUT IF GANDALF DIDN'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN AND GOING BY ONLY WHISPERS HOW COULD HE WARN THEM THANKS AGAIN FOR THE INFO
TO PREFACE I ALSO LOVE THE FILMS AND IN GENERAL I THINK MOST OF THE CHANGES WERE ACCEPTABLE GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN MEDIUM

THAT SAID I HAVE A FEW COMPLAINTS MOST OF THEM PROBABLY COMMON ONES

FARAMIR UTTERLY WORTHLESS IN THE FILM IMMEDIATELY KIDNAPS FRODO WHEN IT'S CLEAR THAT HE'S NOT THE ENEMY CONTINUES TO HOLD HIM HOSTAGE EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS THAT FRODO WAS A COMPANION OF BOOMIER AND THEN TRIES TO TAKE THEM HOSTAGE ALL THE WAY TO FREAKING CONDOR ONCE HE LEARNS ABOUT THE RING SURE HE LET FRODO GO IN THE END BUT HE WAS STILL A HUGE DICK TO BEGIN WITH AND I'M NOT SURE THAT HIM LETTING THEM GO REALLY REDEEMS HIM CONSIDERING HOW MUCH OF TIME HE WASTED AND HOW FAR HE TOOK THEM OUT OF THEIR WAY NOT TO MENTION THAT HIS STUNT AT THE FORBIDDEN POOL IS PROBABLY THE CATALYST THAT UNDOES ALL OF WORK IN REDEEMING GOLLUM SO YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO FEEL SORRY FOR HIM WHEN HE'S RIDING OUT ON THE SUICIDE MISSION AND THEN AFTER THAT GANDALF HAS TO WASTE TIME FROM THE BATTLE TO SAVE SORRY ASS FROM BEING BURNED MOVIE FARAMIR DOES NOT DO A SINGLE GODDAMN USEFUL THING TO HELP IN THE QUEST OR THE WAR AT ALL AT BEST HE'S NEUTRAL AND STAYS OUT OF THE WAY AND AT WORST HE'S A BUMBLING HINDRANCE IT'S LIKE DAMN MAYBE DENETHOR WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL AND FARAMIR IS JUST A BIG SCREW-UP IN THE BOOKS FARAMIR AT LEAST PROVIDED SOME GUIDANCE AND ASSISTANCE TO FRODO WITHOUT BEING A USELESS BUFFOON

WHILE COOL LOOKING ARAGON USING THE GHOST ARMY TO WIN THE BATTLE OF CONDOR KIND OF CHEAPENED THE OVERALL VICTORY IN THE BOOK HE USES THE GHOSTS TO SCARE OFF THE ENEMIES ON THE CORSAIR SHIPS AND BRINGS A COMPANY OF RANGERS AND WARRIORS TO AID IN THE BATTLE BIT MORE IMPACTFUL THAN USING AN INVINCIBLE GHOST ARMY

I REALLY LIKED TO SEE THE CONSPIRACY UNMASKED ARC IT REALLY SERVES TO DEEPEN MERRY AND CHARACTERS AND IT'S PRETTY HILARIOUS WHEN MERRY REVEALS HOW MUCH HE ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT THE RING AND ABOUT MORDOR AND IT SHOWS THAT THEY MAKE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO GO WITH FRODO EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THE STAKES I MUCH PREFER THAT TO THE MOVIES WHERE THEY JUST ACCIDENTALLY BUMP INTO FRODO AND GET CAUGHT UP IN THE EVENTS WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON

ALONG SIMILAR LINES THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE IT'S SHORT BUT IT REALLY HELPS TO TIE EVERYTHING TOGETHER REALLY SHOWING HOW FAR THE HOBBITS HAVE COME SINCE THEY FIRST SET OUT

MAYBE IT'S NOT FAIR BECAUSE TO COUNT THIS BECAUSE IT WAS A DELETED SCENE BUT AS I GENERALLY VASTLY PREFER THE EXTENDED EDITIONS THIS MARKS THE ONLY OCCASION WHERE I THINK THE SCENE STAYED DELETED STAFF BEING BROKEN BY THE WITCH KING IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CHARACTERS AND IS PRETTY UNNECESSARY I DON'T LIKE THAT SCENE AT ALL

THERE ARE OF COURSE MANY OTHER CHANGES THAT I DIDN'T LIST MOST OF THEM I'M NEUTRAL ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE ELVES HELPING OUT AT THE BATTLE OF DEEP TOTALLY NOT IN THE BOOK BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FILMS THAT SAID THERE ARE A FEW CHANGES THAT I THINK ACTUALLY WERE A GOOD IDEA

REMOVAL OF TOM BOBADIL DON'T GET ME WRONG I LOVE CHARACTER AND HIS SONGS AND HIS CHAPTERS ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITES TO REVISIT IN THE BOOK BUT ULTIMATELY HE'S BEST AS A BOOK CHARACTER AND NOT AS A MOVIE CHARACTER I JUST DON'T THINK HIS STORY WOULD TRANSLATE WELL TO FILM I GUESS THE ONE EXCEPTION WOULD BE IF THEY GOT BRIAN BLESSED INVOLVED HE'S THE ONLY ONE I CAN IMAGINE WHO WOULD DO JUSTICE TO CHARACTER

CHARACTER WAS PRETTY DIFFERENT IN THE FILMS AND I KIND OF APPRECIATE WHAT PETER JACKSON DID IT GAVE ARAGON SOME DEPTH IMO IN THE BOOKS HE'S ALREADY PRETTY GUNG-HO ABOUT FLASHING HIS BROKEN SWORD AROUND AND GOING WITH BOOMIER TO CONDOR SHOWING HIM TO INSTEAD PREFER HIS ELDEN UPBRINGING BEFORE RELUCTANTLY COMING TO TERMS WITH HIS ROLE AS A LEADER OF MANKIND WAS A WELCOME CHANGE
I DON'T SEE WHY THEY CUT OUT SONS HALBARAD AND THE GREY COMPANY FROM ROK THEY'RE MAJOR PLAYERS IN STORYLINE AND I LIKED TO SEE THEM INCLUDED
THE ABSOLUTE BUTCHERY OF SAURURAN AND STORY AFTER ISENGARD AND ABSENCE OF THE BATTLE OF THE BYWATER ADAPTATION INCLUDED LITTLE TO NONE OF THE NOBLE CHARACTERISTICS THE BOOKS CLEARLY GAVE HIM AND TO TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER THEY GAVE LITTLE CREDIT TO DENETHOR WHOM SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERALDED MUCH MORE AS A STOUT WARRIOR FOR BEING THE ONLY MAN TO WITHSTAND GUISE VIA THE PALANTIR FOR AS LONG AS HE DID SAME GOES FOR FARAMIR THEY PRETTY MUCH SHIT THE BED WITH THE PORTRAYAL OF MEN

THERE ARE REALLY TOO MANY TO LIST
THE COMPLETE REMOVAL OF THE CHAPTER THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE AND THE VICIOUS MURDER OF SAURURAN
I'M NOT SURE IF THERE IS MUCH OF ANYTHING I WOULD CHANGE BUT THERE ARE SOME SCENES I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THE FILMS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE EXTENDED EDITION JUST ISN'T LONG ENOUGH

ONE SCENE IN PARTICULAR TAKES PLACE IN RIVENDELL AT THE TABLE OF ELROD I LOVE THE CONVERSATION FRODO HAS WITH ALOIN I ALSO LOVE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FRODO RECOGNIZES GANDALF AS MORE THAN JUST A SIMPLE WANDERING MAGE FRODO SEES HIM AS ROYAL AND STATELY SITTING NEXT TO ELROD THIS IS ALSO THE FIRST TIME FRODO SEES ARWEN

SO I GUESS GOING AGAINST WHAT I PREVIOUSLY SAID I WOULD CHANGE SOMETHING FROM THE FOR I DON'T MIND ARWEN ESCAPING TO RIVENDELL WITH FRODO BUT I REALLY DO NOT LIKE HOW THE MOVIE MAKES IT SEEM THAT ARWEN IS CALLING UPON THE WATERS TO RISE UP AGAINST THE RING WRAITHS SHE DOESN'T DO IT IT'S GANDALF AND POWER COMBINED THAT DOES SO I WOULD LIKE THAT LITTLE SCENE OF HER MURMURING A SPELL UNDER HER BREATH TO BE TAKEN OUT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE HER STARTLED AS WELL BY THE CRASHING RIVER WAVES OF WHITE STEEDS TOUCH
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE TOM BOBADIL IN MOVIES BECAUSE HE SAVED HOBBITS IN THE BEGINNING OF THEIR JOURNEY IT IS MAIN PLOT HOLE IN THE MOVIES WITHOUT HIM HOBBITS WOULDNT BE ABLE TO REACH VILLAGE BREE AND JOURNEY WILL BE ENDED SOON
AROMATICMETALLICHOUND
WHILE I LOVE PETER MOVIES THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT I THINK WERE MISHANDLED FARAMIR AND ESPECIALLY HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH DENETHOR WAS ONE OF THEM
I THINK HIS SCENES WITH DENETHOR WERE EXCELLENT BUT THEY TOTALLY SCREWED UP HIS AIR OF WIZARDRY HE HAD IN THE BOOK
HE'S AMAZING IN THE BOOKS SO NOBLE AND GENUINELY GOOD HE'S FAR MORE FLAWED IN MOVIES
FARAMIR IS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE BOOKS BUT PETER VERSION TOTALLY SCREWED HIM UP
I'D AGREE HE AND HIS FATHER WERE ACTUALLY WISE MEN
I AGREE AFTER SEEING THE MOVIES NUMEROUS TIMES AND THEN READING THE BOOKS FARAMIR WAS ONE OF THE MOST PLEASANT SURPRISES I REALLY LIKE THE CHARACTER
I WOULD DISAGREE BOOK FARAMIR IS UNREALISTIC AND KILLS THE POTENCY OF THE RING IN A MOVIE WHERE YOU HAVE LIMITED TIME TO TELL A STORY WITHOUT LOSING YOUR AUDIENCE YOU CAN'T HAVE A MINOR CHARACTER SAYING THAT IF HE FOUND THE OBJECT YOU SPENT A WHOLE MOVIE BUILDING UP AS A VILE DRUG LIKE POWER IS EVEN THE VERY WISE FEAR SAYING THIS

BUT FEAR NO MORE I WOULD NOT TAKE THIS THING IF IT LAY BY THE HIGHWAY NOT WERE MINAS TIGRISH FALLING IN RUIN AND I ALONE COULD SAVE HER SO USING THE WEAPON OF THE DARK LORD FOR HER GOOD AND MY GLORY NO I DO NOT WISH FOR SUCH TRIUMPHS FRODO SON OF DRAGO

YOU'VE JUST KILLED THE RINGS THREAT RIGHT THEN AND THERE I'M AMAZED BOOK FANS DON'T CALL TZOLKIN OUT ON THAT MORE
WHAT DOES THE SCRIPT SAY
IS IT THIS ONE FROM THE CHAPTER THE RIDERS OF ROHAN IN THE TWO TOWERS

THE COUNSEL OF GANDALF WAS NOT FOUNDED ON FOREKNOWLEDGE OF SAFETY FOR HIMSELF OR FOR OTHERS SAID ARAGON THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT IT IS BETTER TO BEGIN THAN TO REFUSE EVEN THOUGH THE END MAY BE DARK

BUT WHAT DESIGN WOULD YOU GO FOR THE RING ISN'T REALLY CENTRAL TO THE STORY OF THE HOBBIT
THE TZOLKIN FAQ DIVES INTO THAT TOPIC QUITE THOROUGHLY

FAQ

TL R TZOLKIN WRITES IN TWO OF HIS LETTERS THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ENT WIVES SURVIVED A SCORCHED EARTH POLICY IN THE WAR AGAINST SARON THAT ENDED THE SECOND AGE THERE IS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN SAM AND TED BANDYMAN IN THE GREEN DRAGON INN IN CHAPTER 2 OF FOR THAT DISCUSSES SIGHTINGS OF MOVING TREES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE SHIRE SOME HAVE CONCLUDED THIS MEANS TZOLKIN INTENDED FOR ENT WIVES TO SURVIVE AND BE IN THE SHIRE BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSION THE FACT IS THIS PART OF LOAR WAS WRITTEN WHEN IT WAS STILL MEANT TO BE A CHILDREN'S BOOK A EQUAL TO THE HOBBIT TZOLKIN HAD ALSO WRITTEN THAT PART BEFORE HE DEVELOPED ANTS I SUGGEST READING THE ENTRY IN ITS ENTIRETY IT SHOULD COVER EVERYTHING PRETTY WELL
COUSIN SAID HE SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN ELM TREE WALKING

THIS IS THE BEST EVIDENCE AND FANGORN TREEBEARD IS SUPER INTERESTED WHEN MERRY AND PIPPIN DESCRIBE THE SHIRE HE ASKS THEM IF THEY'VE SEEN ENTWINES THERE SAYING THAT THEY WOULD LIKE SUCH A COUNTRY AND WHEN THEY DEPART HE BEGS THEM TO SEND NEWS SHOULD THEY SEE ANY

IN A NUTSHELL IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THERE MAY BE ENTWINES IN THE FORESTS OF THE SHIRE I CERTAINLY LIKE TO THINK SO THOUGH THERE'S NO FURTHER MENTION OF THEM IN THE CANON SO FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER
NOT AN LOAR EXPERT BY ANY MEANS BUT I DID READ NOT LONG AGO DIDN'T A TREE ATTACK THE HOBBITS AND THEY MET TOM BOBADIL WHEN HE SAVED THEM FROM IT WAS THAT TREE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ANTS
THE ENTIRE REASON THE ANTS AND THE ENTWINES WERE SEPARATED IS BECAUSE THE ENTWINES DON'T LIKE LIVING IN PLACES LIKE THE OLD FOREST THEY LIKE GARDENS AND FARMS AND WELL-TENDED GROVES THE ENTWINES ARE EITHER ALL DEAD OR SO FAR AWAY THEY'LL NEVER BE FOUNDATION THE FOURTH AGE IS THE AGE OF MEN AND THE ANTS WILL DIE OUT JUST LIKE THE DWARVES AND ELVES
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE ENTWINES SURVIVED BUT I BELIEVE THEY WENT TO WHAT IN THE THIRD AGE WAS CALLED THE BROWN LANDS AND BUILT THEIR GARDENS THERE I THINK THAT THE HERONS IN THE OLD FOREST SOMEHOW SURVIVED FROM THE FIRST AGE WHEN THE WHOLE OF EASTERN MIDDLE WATCH WAS COVERED IN FORESTS AND AS MAN SETTLED AND CUT THEM DOWN AND BELERIAND SUNK THEY GOT SEPARATE AND SOMEHOW SURVIVED
THERE'S ALWAYS THE FUN THOUGHT THAT SAVANNA CALLED THEM TO ALIENOR TO AVOID THEIR IMMINENT FATES WHEN MEN SARON TOOK OVER AND THE MALES WERE LEFT BEHIND TO FIGHT

I MEAN I HAVE EVIDENCE BUT AS FAR AS HEAD CANON GOES IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER THAN THEY ALL DIED
AS LONG AS THERE'S NO PROOF OF THEM BEING EXTINCT I LIKE TO THINK THEY DID
THANKS FOR POSTING MATT
I THINK HE HAD JUST BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH THAT HE COULDN'T SETTLE BACK INTO HIS FORMER LIFE ANYMORE
IT WAS A COMBINATION OF FACTORS THAT MADE FRODO LEAVE MIDDLE-EARTH
PART OF IT WAS JUST FATIGUE AND PROBABLY A DIFFICULTY OF FINDING BACK INTO NORMAL LIFE AFTER HIS EXPERIENCES SAM NOTES THAT FRODO DROPPED QUIETLY OUT OF ALL THE DOINGS OF THE SHIRE AND MORE OR LESS SHUT HIMSELF IN
ANOTHER PART OF IT WAS THE OF THE DAMAGE THE RING HAD CAUSED
ANOTHER PART WAS THE OF THE MOGUL WOUND YOU MENTION NOTE THIS EXCHANGE BETWEEN SAM AND FRODO
ONE EVENING SAM CAME INTO THE STUDY AND FOUND HIS MASTER LOOKING VERY STRANGE HE WAS VERY PALE AND HIS EYES SEEMED TO SEE THINGS FAR AWAY
WHAT S THE MATTER MR FRODO SAID IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL
I AM WOUNDED HE ANSWERED WOUNDED IT WILL NEVER REALLY HEAL
BUT THEN HE GOT UP AND THE TURN SEEMED TO PASS AND HE WAS QUITE HIMSELF THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTERWARDS THAT SAM RECALLED THAT THE DATE WAS OCTOBER THE SIXTH TWO YEARS BEFORE ON THAT DAY IT WAS DARK IN THE DELL UNDER FEATHERTOP

AND FINALLY THERE WERE ALSO OF POISON EVERY MARCH ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF ATTACK ON FRODO HE FELL ILL AGAIN

SO ALL IN ALL FRODO SUFFERED FROM A LOT OF RECURRING AND PROBABLY PERMANENT OF WOUNDS SUSTAINED DURING HIS WAY TO MORDOR THE JOURNEY TO ALIENOR PROMISES HEALING AND REST
I THINK IT'S MOST CLEARLY PUT IN THE QUOTE I ALREADY GAVE ABOVE
I AM WOUNDED HE ANSWERED WOUNDED IT WILL NEVER REALLY HEAL
I'M ALMOST DONE READING THE TWO TOWERS SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE BOOKS YET BUT IN THE FILM

FRODO WINCES AND GRABS HIS SHOULDER

SAM MISTER FRODO WHAT IS IT

FRODO IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS TO THE DAY SINCE FEATHERTOP IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL IT'S NEVER REALLY HEALED

SO IN THE FILMS THERE DEFINITELY IS A RELATION BETWEEN HIS WOUND AND WANTING TO LEAVE MIDDLE EARTH WHETHER IT BE RELATED TO THE PHYSICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL PAIN
YEAH ITS CRAZY WHAT FRODO WENT THOUGHT IT MAKES SENSE HE NEEDED TO LEAVE ITS JUST SAD HE DIDNT GET TO LIVE A FULL LIFE MAYBE SAM SHOULD OF HELD THE RING YOU KNOW LIGHTEN THE LOAD
WHERE DO I BUY THIS
I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF PARTY SCENE WHEN I SAW THE OP OF THIS GIF
I SAW A HALLOWEEN BLOW UP YARD DRAGON AT WALMART AND I WAS SAD IT DIDN'T HAVE WINGS WHAT KIND OF DRAGON DOESN'T HAVE WINGS NICE KITE
NONSENSE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN DRAGONS IN THESE PARTS FOR A THOUSAND YEARS
WELL IT'S A DRAGON ALRIGHT
HOW SMUG SHOULD HAVE LOOKED IN THE MOVIES
THIS IS SWEET I WANT TO GET AN ACRE ENTULUVA TATTOO AS WELL SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SECTION OF THE SILMARILLION AND TOLKIENS WRITING
NICELY DONE BEST QUOTE EVER
MY FRIEND AND I GOT THESE BACK IN
XNPVPX
STILL DON'T REGRET IT
COOL I HAVE AN ILE QUELUVA ONE LOVE THE ENDING
DAMN THAT'S PRETTY COOL HOW ACCURATE IS THE TRANSCRIPTION
I'VE GOT THE SAME TATTOO 2 WEEKS AGO ON MY RIGHT FOREARM I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THAT PASSAGE OF AURIN IS ONE OF THE KEYS OF THE SILMARILLION ANGER AND HOPE AT THE SAME TIME AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS SENTENCE MEANS FOR ME ON MY SKIN ANGER AND HOPE
TIOCFADH AR L
CONSIDER READING THE APPENDICES

THROUGHOUT THE THIRD AGE THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE THREE RINGS WAS KNOWN ONLY TO THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM BUT AT THE END IT BECAME KNOWN THAT THEY HAD BEEN HELD AT FIRST BY THE THREE GREATEST OF THE ELDAR GALADRIEL AND CHURDAN BEFORE HE DIED GAVE HIS RING TO ELROD CHURDAN LATER SURRENDERED HIS TO MITHRANDIR FOR CHURDAN SAW FURTHER AND DEEPER THAN ANY OTHER IN MIDDLE-EARTH AND HE WELCOMED MITHRANDIR AT THE GREY HAVENS KNOWING WHENCE HE CAME AND WHITHER HE WOULD RETURN

TAKE THIS RING MASTER HE SAID FOR YOUR LABOURS WILL BE HEAVY BUT IT WILL SUPPORT YOU IN THE WEARINESS THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN UPON YOURSELF FOR THIS IS THE RING OF FIRE AND WITH IT YOU MAY REKINDLE HEARTS IN A WORLD THAT GROWS CHILL BUT AS FOR ME MY HEART IS WITH THE SEA AND I WILL DWELL BY THE GREY SHORES UNTIL THE LAST SHIP SAILS I WILL AWAIT YOU
SECONDARY QUESTION WHY ARE DWARVES EXCLUDING GIMLI BARELY MENTIONED IN THE MAIN TRILOGY DO THEY NOT HAVE MUCH PRESENCE IN MIDDLE-EARTH
WEIDER OF THE FLAME OF AFNOR
THE STONE GIANT'S ARE A LEFTOVER FROM WHEN THE HOBBIT WAS WRITTEN AT THE TIME OF ITS WRITING TZOLKIN DID HAVE GIANTS BUT THIS IDEA CHANGED AND EVOLVED SUCH THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS WRITING LOAR GIANTS WERE NO LONGER PART OF HIS MIDDLE-EARTH SO IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN THINK OF THE GIANTS AS METAPHOR FOR THE STORM ITSELF

WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT

MELIOR MORGOTH TWISTED THE OTHERS CREATIONS INTO HIS OWN ELVES ORCS AND ANTS TROLLS KNOW I'M FORGETTING SOME

BE CAREFUL HERE ORCS AS CORRUPTED ELVES IS ALSO AN EARLY IDEA OF ONE THAT WAS LARGELY REJECTED AND WE'RE TOLD IN LOAR THAT TROLLS AND ORCS WERE MADE IN MOCKERIES OF ANTS AND ELVES NOT THAT THEY WERE MADE FROM ANTS AND ELVES
I DON'T KNOW HOW WIDELY THIS THEORY IS ACCEPTED AMONG TZOLKIN FANS BUT THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT BILBO JUST MADE THEM UP MAYBE THERE WAS A LANDSLIDE OR SOMETHING RELATIVELY MUNDANE AND BILBO DECIDED TO INJECT A LITTLE EMBELLISHMENT TO HIS STORY
THE HOBBIT WASN'T ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO BE A PART OF WIDER MYTHOLOGY FROM THE SILMARILLION LOT'S OF INCONSISTENCIES ARE LEFT AS A RESULT OF THAT
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN THE SPIRITS OF THE MOUNTAINS IN LOAR GIMLI EXPRESSES A BELIEF IN THE PERSONIFICATION OF THE SPIRES OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS THIS IDEA IS SEEN SEVERAL PLACES INCLUDING AREAS AROUND WHERE TOM BOBADIL LIVES WHERE THE RIVER AND THE TREES AND THE LAND ITSELF HAS SPIRITS THAT ARE ALIVE AND FERAL AND HARKEN BACK INTO THE DEPTHS OF TIME WHEN THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALIVE
THEY'RE ABOUT AS CANON AS INVENTION OF GOLF

AND WHERE THE HELL DID OLD BOBADIL GET A BLUE JACKET AND YELLOW BOOTS
DON'T FORGET THOSE NICE HAIRY BIG FEET
TZOLKIN DREW BILBO WEARING TYPICAL SHIRT WAISTCOAT AND BREECHES THAT WENT TO THE CALVES I EXPECT HIS MODEL WAS THE LONG LOOSE MAN'S SHIRT THAT WAS COMMON IN ENGLAND FROM THE LATE TO THE EARLY CENTURY TEXTILES WOULD BE HOMESPUN WOOL COTTON AND FLAX MAYBE HEMP WHO KNOWS MAYBE PLANTS WE NO LONGER HAVE AND FIBERS WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT

NO MENTION IS MADE OF HATS AT ALL NOT A HAT WEARING RACE I GUESS

THEY GET CLOAKS FROM THE ELVES LATER ON AND BILBO FINDS GOOD POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS ESSENTIAL ACCESSORIES

YOU WON'T GO FAR WRONG LOOKING AT ENGLISH COUNTRY DRESS OF THE PERIOD ESPECIALLY GARMENTS LIKE THE FROCK

PACKS EXHIBITIONS WEBS

MR MCDONALD EVEN HAS A YELLOW WAISTCOAT
SILMARILLION IS KINDA GLOOMY IN THE BEGINNING SO I'D IMAGINE A PERFECT SPOT TO BE MORE
WHERE IS THIS
AS SOMEONE LOOKING AT MOVING INTO A CABIN IN THE MOUNTAINS THIS LOOKS VERY APPEALING
NEEDS MORE VIOLENT ARISTOCRATIC ELVES
I'M SORRY WHAT ARE YOU DOING READING ON A DAY LIKE THAT THAT'S THE PERFECT DAY AND PLACE TO MEET ELVES
I'M JEALOUS

HOW ABOUT LOOKING ONTO THE ALPS
YEA TURN THAT SATURATION UP A LITTLE HIGHER
VERY BEAUTIFUL AND MY FAVORITE BOOK
FOR ALL THE GRANDIOSE CINEMATOGRAPHY USED IN THE MOVIES IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS LARGELY ABOUT THE DANGERS OF INDUSTRIALISATION AND THE THREAT TO RURAL ENGLAND

A VILLAGE PUB IN THE WEST MIDLANDS IS PROBABLY THE MOST APT PLACE TO READ STORIES OF ARDA
BEST PLACE TO READ THE SILMARILLION IS GONDOLIER BEFORE THE FALL
NOT ONLY TO READ THE THE PERFECT PLACE TO BE IN GENERAL LOL
THIS IS UNDER ONE OF THE TREES OF LIGHT
YOU DON'T SIMPLY READ THE SILMARILLION

YOU STUDY IT YOU ABSORB IT SLOWLY YOU GO BACK AND FORTH TIME AND AGAIN YOU TAKE FUCKING NOTES YOU TITLE PARAGRAPHS

DAMN I WISH I COULD BE SO THOROUGH ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT TZOLKIN
OH SAY CAN YOU SEE

ALL I CAN SEE IS THE FLAG AMERICAN PATRIOTISM IS NAUSEATING
IF IT AIN'T NEW ZEALAND IT AIN'T MIDDLE EARTH
I READ LOAR IN I WAS

IT WOULD PRETTY MUCH BE IMPOSSIBLE TO LOVE IT MORE THAN I DID THEN BUT NOW I HAVE A DEEPER LOVE I LEARN SOMETHING NEW EITHER ABOUT THE BOOK OR ABOUT MYSELF EVERY TIME I READ IT
I WAS OR WHEN THE FELLOWSHIP CAME OUT MY OPINION OF ALL THINGS TZOLKIN HAS ONLY GROWN
I SAW THE BEGINNING OF THE FELLOWSHIP ON TV WHILE CHANNEL SURFING WITH MY DAD WHEN I WAS AND HE SAID OH WE HAVE TO WATCH THIS SO WE STAYED UP AND WATCHED THE WHOLE THING I READ THE MAIN TRILOGY AND THE HOBBIT IN THIRD AND FOURTH GRADES SO I GUESS WHEN I WAS EIGHT OR NINE I READ THE SILMARILLION FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL SINCE THEN I'VE READ THE TRILOGY ANOTHER TWO OR THREE TIMES CURRENTLY REREADING THE SILMARILLION FOR AT LEAST THE FIFTH TIME AND I JUST FINISHED PARSING THROUGH THE UNFINISHED TALES AND THE LAYS OF BELERIAND BY CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN I REALLY DON'T LIKE TO REREAD BOOKS SINCE MOST JUST AREN'T INTERESTING ENOUGH TO WARRANT MULTIPLE READTHROUGHS BUT WORK IS THE BIGGEST EXCEPTION TO THIS I DON'T THINK THAT I'LL EVER GET TIRED OF READING THEM BECAUSE I ALWAYS FIND OR REMEMBER SOME DETAIL THAT I HAVEN'T BEFORE
I READ THE HOBBIT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN READ LORD OF THE RINGS AT ABOUT THIRTEEN
I SAW THE HOBBIT SPECIAL WHEN IT FIRST AIRED ON TV AROUND ISH I READ IT A MILLION TIMES AND THEN I FINALLY READ THIS OTHER BOOK BY THE SAME AUTHOR THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING IT BLOWS MY MIND THAT THERE ARE FANS YOUNG ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE MOVIES ON TV DIDN'T THE MOVIES COME OUT JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO
I WAS TWELVE OR THIRTEEN THE FIRST TIME I READ THEM SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THEM ROUGHLY ONCE A YEAR FOR MANY YEARS I READ THE OLD SWEDISH TRANSLATION THE INFAMOUS ONE BY AKE OHLMARKS SO READING THEM IN ENGLISH THE FIRST TIME WAS AN EYE-OPENER TO SAY THE LEAST

I STILL READ NEW THINGS WHEN READING THEM DEEPENING MY RESPECT FOR HOW WELL-THOUGHT OUT THE WORLD AND HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH IS

I'VE SEEN THE MOVIES AND BEAUTIFUL AS THEY ARE I THINK THEY ARE REALLY POOR ADAPTATIONS DON'T OWN THEM NEVER WILLIAM I RECOMMEND THEM TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T READ THE BOOKS AND ASK THEM TO READ THE BOOKS AS WELL
I GREW UP WATCHING THE HOBBIT AND MY DAD READ THE HOBBIT ALOUD TO MY SISTER AND ME WHEN I WAS VERY SMALL PROBABLY YEARS OLD I STILL REMEMBER HIM READING ABOUT THE WAGS GETTING TO BEHORN AND BEING SURPRISED BECAUSE HE WASN'T IN THE MOVIE AND JUST BEING SO EXCITED FOR STORY TIME

WHEN I GOT TO GRADE SCHOOL I STARTED WATCHING THE RETURN OF THE KING AND REALISED THAT THE RING WAS SO MUCH MORE EVIL THAN I EVER THOUGHT IT WAS

THEN WHEN I WAS MY DAD TOLD ME THAT A NEW LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIE TRILOGY WAS BEING MADE TO PREPARE I STARTED READING THE BOOKS AT AND EVEN WATCHED THE BAKSHI LOAR WHICH WE MOCKED MERCILESSLY

I COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF TZOLKIN SO I READ FARMER GILES OF HAM ETC AND EVEN STARTED READING THE SILMARILLION AT AGE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND MOST OF IT BUT I READ IT AT LEAST TWICE MORE I TOTALLY DESTROYED MY DAD'S FIRST EDITION FIRST PRINTING COPY BY CARRYING IT WITH ME EVERYWHERE FOR A YEAR OUCH

I WATCHED PETER MOVIES NEARLY EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND ONCE THEY WERE ON DVD

MY OPINION OF THEM HAS CHANGED FROM THINKING THAT THEY WERE A REALLY GOOD STORY TO HONESTLY BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THE BEST WORKS OF FICTION I'VE EVER READ THE MORE I READ LETTERS UNFINISHED TALES BOOK OF LOST TALES THE MORE I'M AWARE OF THE EMOTIONAL THEMATIC PHILOSOPHICAL AND PHILOLOGICAL DEPTH HIS WORK HAS AND ONLY LOVE IT MORE
MY COLLEGE BUDDY BROUGHT ME TO SEE THE FIRST MOVIE I DON'T THINK I BLINKED OR MOVED FROM THE FRONT EDGE OF MY SEAT THE ENTIRE TIME I REMEMBER BEING SO PISSED WHEN IT ENDED AND THAT I'D HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR FOR THE SECOND ONE EVER SINCE THAT DAY I BECAME A TZOLKIN FREAK I'VE READ WATCHED AND PLAYED EVERYTHING I THINK BETTER LATE THAN NEVER
FIRST READ LOAR IN LIKE OR WHEN I WAS WATCHED THE MOVIES AS THEY CAME OUT IN THEATERS
I'M READING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW I ONLY HAVE TIME TO USE AUDIOBOOKS THOUGH SO I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE TO LISTEN TO THE RETURN OF THE KING
I READ THE HOBBIT AT AND DIDN'T REVISIT IT UNTIL I WAS IN COLLEGE SINCE THEN I READ THE SERIES PROBABLY TIMES A YEAR STILL FINDING THINGS THAT I HAVEN'T DISCOVERED BEFORE THE DEPTH OF MIDDLE EARTH IS INCREDIBLE THE HOBBIT AND LORD OF THE RINGS SERIES HAVE INFLUENCED ME GREATLY
I READ THE HOBBIT AND LOAR THROUGH FINISHING WHEN I WAS FROM THEN ON IN SCHOOL I HAD EXCEPTIONAL READING WRITING SKILLS AND I BLAME THAT EXPERIENCE I'VE READ THE BOOKS A LOT OF TIMES SINCE AS WELL AS A BUNCH OF THE OTHER STUFF

I WATCHED THE LOAR FILMS WITHIN HOURS OF THEM COMING OUT IN NZ AND A NUMBER OF TIMES THE DIRECTOR'S CUTS I WATCHED THE FIRST HOBBIT FILM A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER IT CAME OUT AND HAD A PHANTOM MENACE MOMENT I WILL NOT WATCH ANY OF THE HOBBIT FILMS AGAIN BUT AM GONNA WATCH ONE OF THE FAN EDITS SOON

I READ THE BOOKS TO MY DAUGHTER FINISHING WHEN SHE WAS OR I WAS AWARE OF HOW MUCH MY OPINION OF THEM HAS CHANGED I SAW A LOT MORE OF THE HUMOUR THE BOOKS HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF INTERNAL COHESION AND I APPRECIATE THE CONNECTION TO THE DEEPER HISTORY THAT TZOLKIN DEVELOPED

I AM ALSO AWARE OF JUST HOW CONSERVATIVE TZOLKIN WAS SOCIALLY AND FIND THE ROMANCES ODD

I STILL NOTICE NEW SUBTLETIES FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE HOBBITS ARE CAVORTING IN THE PRANCING PONY STRIDER WATCHES THEM IMMERSED IN SHADOWS A BROODING FIGURE OF DARKNESS HE IS ONE OF TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOWS BOTH WHAT FRODO IS CARRYING AND ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE HE IS HEIR HE IS ALSO A MORTAL MAN SUBJECT TO THE ALLURE OF THE ONE

WHAT CHANCE WAS THERE THAT HE WASN'T CONTEMPLATING TAKING IT FROM FRODO HE WOULD PROTECT THESE BUMBLING IDIOTS FROM THE SHADOW THAT HAUNTED THEM THE CAPERING BUFFOONS WERE PUTTING IT IN JEOPARDY AS THEY WERE SURE TO DO AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HE WOULD BE BEST TO KEEP IT SAFE TO DESTROY IT OR PERHAPS EVEN OVERCOME SARON ONCE AND FOR ALL AND CONDOR

THOSE SHADOWS HE SITS IN MIGHT WELL BE A FIGURE FOR THE TEMPTATION THAT THE RING PUTS UPON HIM AND EVEN THOUGH HE OVERCOMES THAT TEMPTATION THE DOUBTS ABOUT THE HOBBITS MUST SURELY REMAIN A SHADOW OVER HIM
I FIRST READ HOBBIT IN AND LOAR IN AT AGE IT WAS THE SUMMER BEFORE MY SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I READ LOAR IN THREE DAYS WHEN SAM SAYS WELL I'M BACK I BURST INTO TEARS THEN WENT RIGHT BACK TO THE BEGINNING AND READ IT AGAIN

I'VE LOST TRACK OF HOW MANY TIMES I'VE READ THESE BOOKS AND YES LORD OF THE RINGS IS A VERY DIFFERENT STORY WHEN YOU ARE A TEENAGER I IDENTIFIED MOST WITH PIPPIN THAN IT IS WHEN YOU HIT MIDDLE AGE AT THAT POINT LIKE BILBO AND ESPECIALLY FRODO YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THAT LIFE ONLY GETS MORE COMPLICATED NOT LESS YOUR TROUBLES RISE TO CHALLENGE YOUR MATURITY YOU WILL START GETTING BAD NEWS FROM YOUR BANK YOUR DOCTOR OR YOUR FRIENDLY FAMILY WIZARD

I LOVED THE MOVIES BTW
WHEN I WAS AROUND MY DAD READ ME THE HOBBIT AND THEN CONTINUED ON THROUGH LOAR I'M NOW BUT I WHENEVER I DO A I STILL PICTURE SOME SCENES THE WAY I DID WHEN I WAS YOUNG MY DAD ALSO TOOK ME TO THE MIDNIGHT PREMIERS OF ALL THREE MOVIES I WAS SO YOUNG FOR THE FIRST ONE THAT I THOUGHT THE COSPLAYERS PRESENT WERE ACTUALLY THE ACTORS BEING INTRODUCED TO THE SERIES AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE CAUSED IT TO BE A HUGE PART OF MY CHILDHOOD I WAS ALWAYS PRETENDING TO BE ONE CHARACTER ANOTHER ALWAYS PESTERING MY GRANDMOTHER TO SEW ME SOME ELVISH CLOTHING AND ALWAYS TRYING TO DRAG MY FRIENDS INTO IMAGINATION GAMES IT JUST MAKES THE SERIES THAT MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL AND FUN FOR ME AS AN ADULT
MY DAD BOUGHT ME MY FIRST COPY WHEN I WAS I'M NOW AND I'VE READ THEM EVERY YEAR SINCE THEN
READ THE HOBBIT AS A KID OF OR AND I DON'T THINK I EVEN FINISHED IT IT WAS TOO WHIMSICAL AND TWEE FOR ME EVEN THEN SAW THE LOAR MOVIES AS AN ADULT WHEN THEY CAME OUT AND LOVED THEM LIKE CRAZY I WAITED TIL I'D SEEN ALL THE MOVIES THEN SAT DOWN AND READ THOSE BOOKS WHICH I LIKED MUCH BETTER THAN THE HOBBIT
I READ LOAR PROBABLY AROUND THE YEAR WHEN I WAS LIKE THEN I SAW ALL THE MOVIES AS THEY CAME OUT IN THEATERS I NEVER GOT SUPER INTO THEM BACK THEN BUT I'VE BEEN REVISITING THE MOVIES LATELY AND EVERYTHING IS WAY DIFFERENT AS A YEAR OLD VS AN YEAR OLD HAHA I'M HONESTLY CONSIDERING READING THE BOOKS AGAIN SOMETIME BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME A LOT OF IT WENT OVER MY HEAD
WHEN I WAS IN MY DAD USED TO READ ME A SNOW WHITE TALE I LOVED THE DWARVES SO HE SWAPPED IT OUT FOR THE HOBBIT AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SONGS AND THE ADVENTURE WHEN I WAS I READ THE HOBBIT ON MY OWN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I THINK I WAS WHEN I FIRST READ LOAR BEAR IN MIND THE MOVIES WERE ALREADY OUT BY THE TIME I WAS LIKE SO I HAD SEEN MY OLDER BROTHER WATCHING THEM ON AND OFF AND WAS AMAZED BY THE BATTLE SCENES EVER SINCE I WAS I'VE READ THEM EVERY YEAR AROUND CHRISTMAS TIME SO I HAD PRETTY MUCH SEEN THE MOVIES BEFORE I READ THE BOOKS BUT I WAS FIRST READ THE BOOK BY MY FATHER AT THE AGE OF

I'M NOW BTW LOL
WATCHED FELLOWSHIP WHEN IT CAME OUT IN I WAS LOVED IT AS MUCH NOW AS I DID THEN

STARTED READING THE BOOKS AS WELL AFTER THAT WHICH I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY ENJOY APPRECIATED IT MORE AS I GOT OLDER
I WATCHED THE MOVIES WAY TOO MANY TIMES BUT DIDN'T READ THE BOOKS JUST THIS JANUARY I STARTED TRAVELING AROUND NEW ZEALAND FOR MONTHS AND HAD THE TRILOGY WITH ME READING THE BOOKS THE FIRST TIME WHILE YOU ARE ACTUAL CAMPING IN ROHAN WAS FANTASTIC MY READING HIGHLIGHT WAS MY READ ON TOP OF MOUNT DOOM

OF COURSE I HAD TO VISIT HOBBITON ALSO WHICH WAS AMAZING

EDIT I'M
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT R TOLKIENFANS IS DOING A READTHROUGH OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS RIGHT NOW WITH DISCUSSION POSTS EVERY WEEK THEY'RE CURRENTLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE WAY THROUGH THE TWO TOWERS I BELIEVE BUT ALL THE OLD DISCUSSION THREADS SHOULD BE ARCHIVED IT MIGHT BE WORTH SKIMMING OVER SOME OF THEM TO FIND SOME TALKING POINTS
EVERY YEAR NEED TO THE BOOKS TOO SOON
I READ THE SILMARILLION THE HOBBIT AND THE LORD OF THE RINGS EVERY SINGLE YEAR

THE MOVIES I TRY TO GET AROUND TO ONCE IN A YEAR BUT IT'S NOT AS BIG OF A PRIORITY FOR ME AS THE BOOKS USUALLY I TRY TO HOST A AT MY HOUSE DURING THE CHRISTMAS BREAK A BUNCH OF FRIENDS COME OVER AND WE WATCH ALL EXTENDED EDITIONS SOME YEARS IT FALLS THROUGH THOUGH

SO I DON'T KNOW USUALLY ABOUT ONCE A YEAR BUT IT VARIES
I PREFER THE THEATRICAL EDITION
I'M PRETTY SPORADIC I'VE GONE A COUPLE YEARS WITHOUT SEEING THEM BUT RECENTLY WATCHED THEM ABOUT TIMES IN ABOUT AS MANY MONTHS THE LAST ONE WAS PART OF A GROUP UNPLANNED I READ THE NOVELS LESS FREQUENTLY I THINK THEY LOSE THEIR FLAIR MORE QUICKLY IF OVER-READ
ABOUT ONCE A YEAR
EVERY YEAR ON THE THREE DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY OR I KINDA DO BUT THEY GIVE ME CHRISTMASY HOPE VIBES
USUALLY ONCE DURING THE SUMMER AND ONCE AT CHRISTMASTIME BUT I MISSED MY SUMMER MARATHON THIS YEAR
EVERY YEAR AT CHRISTMAS I WATCH FOR THE OF DECEMBER AND THE REST WHEN I HAVE TIME
USUALLY WATCH THE EXTENDED TRILOGY ONCE PER YEAR AND THE BOOKS EVERY FEW YEARS
I WATCHED THEM LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE NIGHT FROM THE FIRST DAY FOR RELEASED ON DVD IN UNTIL I SHIPPED OFF TO BOOTCAMP IN I WOULD START UP THE MOVIE AND WATCH UNTIL I FELL ASLEEP THE NEXT DAY I'D START IT UP FROM THE LAST POINT I REMEMBER FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND CONTINUE ON UNTIL I FINISHED ALL MOVIES THEN I'D START OVER AGAIN ONCE THE EXTENDED CUT OF ANY OF THEM CAME OUT I'D TOSS OUT THE THEATRICAL CUT AND STARTED WATCHING EXTENDED CUTS LET'S JUST SAY I CAN LITERALLY RECITE THE ENTIRE SCRIPT OF ALL MOVIES WITH THE SOUND MUTED ONCE I FINISHED BOOTCAMP AND FINALLY GOT TO START WATCHING MOVIES AGAIN I WATCH THEM ABOUT ONCE EVERY TO MONTHS OR SO SINCE I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN BORED OF THEM OR ENJOY THEM ANY LESS THAN I EVER HAVE I ALSO REREAD THE BOOKS EVERY YEAR CURRENTLY READING THE HOBBIT RIGHT NOW ON THE CHAPTER OF THE SPIDER BATTLE FLIES AND SPIDERS I BELIEVE THEN I'LL MOVE ON THE LOAR
LAST TIME I SAW THEM WAS ABOUT YEARS AGO
I USED TO WATCH A LOT WHEN THE HOBBIT FILMS CAME OUT I TOOK A BREAK FOR LIKE FOUR YEARS NOW I TRY NOT TO GET TOO FREQUENT
TWICE A YEAR AT LEAST MORE IF I GET INTO THE MOOD TO RECATCH
ABOUT EVERY MONTHS WORKING ON THE BOOKS TOO

I WATCH EACH TRILOGY THE HOBBIT AND LOAR USUALLY ON A MONTHLY BASIS

MY CYCLE IS AS FOLLOWS WATCH THE HOBBIT TRILOGY SMALL WEEK BREAK WATCH THE LOAR TRILOGY LONG WEEK BREAK REPEAT

I CAN REALLY RELATE THE FILMS HAVE SUCH A PROFOUND LEVEL OF EMOTIONAL AND VISUAL APPEAL YOU BROUGHT UP RISKING DRAINING YOUR LOVE FOR THE FILMS AND FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE I CAN SAY THAT MAINTAINING A STRONG VIGOR FOR THESE FILMS AND MIDDLE-EARTH IN GENERAL IS LIKE MAINTAINING A FIRE PERHAPS A SECRET FIRE

PUT TOO MUCH MATERIAL IN AND YOU BURY THE FLAME PUT TOO LITTLE AND THE FLAME DIES IT'S ALL ABOUT MAINTAINING A HEALTHY CYCLE OF WATCHING AS BORDERLINE RITUALISTIC AS THIS SOUNDS AND THIS HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE FOR ME CHEERS
HAVEN'T SEEN THEM IN MANY YEARS OTHER THAN SHORT CLIPS NOT GONNA SEE THEM IN MANY MORE YEARS EITHER
BOTH THE HOBBIT AND THE LORD OF THE RINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TRANSLATIONS OF AND FRODO WRITINGS IN THE RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH

SO I THINK MOST PEOPLE JUST READ NARRATION THAT SEEMS TO COME FROM THE BIG FOLK AS ASIDES BY TZOLKIN ADDED DURING THE TRANSLATION

BUT THE TRUE ANSWER IS THAT WHEN THE HOBBIT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE A PART OF MYTHOLOGICAL CONSTRUCT SO IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE WRITTEN AS A TEXT THAT WAS LATER DISCOVERED THIS IS WHY THE HOBBIT SEEMS SO THEMATICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE THE LORD OF THE RINGS AND THE SILMARILLION AS WELL AS WHY IT IS AT TIMES INCONSISTENT WITH THE LORE OF THOSE OTHER WORKS
BILBO IS BOTH THE AUTHOR SO THE VOICE AND ALSO A CHARACTER IN HIS OWN STORY JNR TZOLKIN WAS MERELY THE TRANSLATOR SO IT IS A BOOK WRITTEN BY A HOBBIT BUT TRANSLATED BY HUMANS IN LOAR THERE IS TALK OF BOOK WHICH IS PROBABLY THE HOBBIT OR AN EARLY DRAFT OF IT

THERE ARE ALSO A FEW EVENTS WHERE BILBO ISN'T PRESENT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SEE OFTEN IN LOAR AS WELL THAT THE POV CHARACTER ISN'T AROUND AND ONLY HEARS OF EVENT AFTER THE FACT THERE IS A VERY INTERESTING TALK BY PROFESSOR MICHAEL BROUT ON YOUTUBE CALLED HOW TO READ TZOLKIN WHICH IS INTERESTING TO WATCH AFTER YOU FINISH LOAR
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NARRATED BY TZOLKIN HOWEVER IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS TZOLKIN INVENTED THE FICTION THAT THE HOBBIT WAS WRITTEN BY BILBO HIMSELF AND MERELY TRANSLATED BY TZOLKIN THAT FICTION DID NOT EXIST WHEN THE HOBBIT WAS WRITTEN THOUGH AND THERE ARE MANY ASIDES FROM THE NARRATOR IN THE HOBBIT THAT REVEAL THE NARRATOR TO BE TZOLKIN HIMSELF

THIS STARTS IN THE FOURTH PARAGRAPH OF CHAPTER ONE

THE MOTHER OF OUR PARTICULAR HOBBIT WHAT IS A HOBBIT I SUPPOSE HOBBITS NEED SOME DESCRIPTION NOWADAYS SINCE THEY HAVE BECOME RARE AND SHY OF THE BIG PEOPLE AS THEY CALL US

US CLEARLY REFERS TO THE HUMAN READERS AND THE HUMAN NARRATOR A CONTEMPORARY OF THE READERS

THAT BEING SAID ALTHOUGH BILBO DID NOT NARRATE THE HOBBIT FOR THE MOST PART IT IS TOLD FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW THE ASIDES BY THE MODERN NARRATOR ARE JUST THAT ASIDES WE EXPERIENCE THE ACTUAL STORY THROUGH EYES AND EARS EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT A FIRST PERSON ACCOUNT AND AT THE END OF THE TALE WE DO LEARN THAT HE IS WRITING HIS MEMOIRS WHICH LEADS INTO THE FICTION CREATED IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS
AS A BOOK THIS IS TRICKSY THE CONCEIT PARTICULARLY IN LOAR IS THAT BILBO AND THEN FRODO WROTE THEM ORIGINALLY AND THEY WERE EMBELLISHED BY LATER HOBBITS OVER TIME INTO THE RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH TZOLKIN THEN CAME ALONG AND TRANSLATED IT TO ENGLISH FOR US THE HOBBIT IS MUCH MORE A CONTEMPORARY AUTHOR'S LOOSE RETELLING BASED ON MEMOIR TZOLKIN DOES AWAY AITH A LOT MORE OF HIS OWN MODERN AUTHORIAL VOICE IN THE SEQUEL THOUGH A FEW TOUCHES REMAIN EARLY ON SUCH AS THE COMPARISON TO AN EXPRESS TRAIN

SHORT ANSWER THE BOOK IS WRITTEN BY BILBO THEN READ AND RETOLD BY TZOLKIN IN A STORYTELLER VOICE
READ IT AND YOU SHALL FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF
FILMS OR BOOKS KIND OF IMPORTANT
AMAZON SELLS A KINDLE VERSION AND APPLE HAS ONE AS WELL

I'D GUESS ITUNES OR AMAZON MAY BE GOOD PLACES TO CHECK OR MAYBE KUDU
ITUNES HAS BOTH THEATRICAL AND EXTENDED EDITIONS OF LOAR AND HOBBIT TRILOGIES
YOUTUBE HAS MOVIES TO RENT
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE PRETTY WELL COVERED THE OFFICIAL ONLINE RETAILERS BUT I WANTED TO POINT OUT A DANISH CONNECTION IN THAT QUEEN MARGARETHE II IS ALSO A LOAR FAN AND DID SOME ILLUSTRATIONS BACK IN THE UNDER THE NAME INGAHILD GRATHER TZOLKIN LIKED HER WORK
DELETED
PERGOLAS IS JUST LIKE GUYS COME ON
THE ARTIST'S GALLERY
FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES
IN THE LONELY MOUNTAIN AND IN THE CITY OF DALE
ABSOLUTELY THERE ARE TRUTHFULLY WHAT IS GENERALLY THOUGHT OF AS TRADITIONAL FANTASY OWES AS MUCH TO D D AS TO TZOLKIN TZOLKIN HAD PERGOLAS AS AN ARCHER AND GIMLI WITH AN AXE D D SAID ALL ELVES ARE ARCHERS AND ALL DWARVES WIELD AXES

THERE WERE PLENTY OF FANTASY STORIES THAT PREDATE TZOLKIN THE ARTHUR LEGEND LORD DUNSANY HP HOVERCRAFT HOPE MIRRLEES JACK VANCE AND YOU CAN FIND PLENTY OF FANTASY WRITTEN IN OUR TRADITIONS BESIDES TZOLKIN THE PERCEPTION OF FANTASY AS BEING A BUNCH OF TZOLKIN CLONES REALLY IS TO BE BLAMED ON BALLENTINE BOOKS AND THE SWORD OF SHANKARA AND I DON'T REALLY BLAME TERRY BROOKS FOR ANY OF THIS

BASICALLY LOAR HAD BEEN THE ONLY FANTASY BOOK TO ACHIEVE WIDE SUCCESS AMONG ADULT AUDIENCES BALLENTINE WANTED TO SEE IF THERE WAS A MARKET FOR FANTASY BOOKS IN GENERAL OR IF SUCCESS HAD BEEN A FLUKE SO THEY HAD BROOKS WRITE A BOOK AS CLOSE TO TZOLKIN POSSIBLE AND THE SWORD OF SHANKARA WAS A HUGE SUCCESS AN ERA OF TZOLKIN WAS BORN

AS AN ASIDE TZOLKIN CLONE REPUTATION IS UNFAIR SWORD MIGHT BE AN LOAR CLONE BUT THAT WAS EXPLICITLY WHAT THE PUBLISHER WANTED AND HIS EARLY DRAFTS WERE VERY DIFFERENT PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY DIED FOR ONE HIS SUBSEQUENT BOOKS DON'T BORROW ALL THAT MUCH FROM TZOLKIN AND ELFSTONES OF SHANKARA IS A GENUINELY GOOD BOOK BY ANY STANDARD

SO THINGS PROCEEDED FOR AWHILE WITH FANTASY DOMINATED BY SMALL GROUPS OF NOBLE HEROES UNDERTAKING DANGEROUS QUESTS TO DEFEAT GREAT EVILS THERE WAS ORIGINAL STUFF BEING WRITTEN IN THIS ERA LIKE THE EXTREMELY CHRONICLES OF THOMAS COVENANT THE UNBELIEVER BUT THEY WEREN'T ALL THAT SUCCESSFUL

THE SHIFT AWAY FROM TZOLKIN REALLY BEGAN IN THE EARLY WHEN ROBERT JORDAN BEGAN WRITING THE WHEEL OF TIME THE FIRST BOOK THE EYE OF THE WORLD WAS CAREFULLY AND DELIBERATELY MODELED AFTER LOAR PRECISELY BECAUSE JORDAN KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE TAKING HIS READERS SOMEWHERE NEW AND HE WANTED THEM TO START OUT ON FAMILIAR FOOTING

THE WHEEL OF TIME WAS A BREAK FROM TZOLKIN IN MANY WAYS JORDAN DELIBERATELY WROTE AGAINST A NUMBER OF WELL-ESTABLISHED TROPES THE CHOSEN ONE WAS A FIGURE TO BE FEARED AND DREADED RATHER THAN BEING ONE THAT IS LONGED FOR THE GANDALF FIGURE WAS GREETED WITH SUSPICION AND MISTRUST WHEN SHE SHOWS UP AND TELLS THE PROTAGONIST THAT THE WORLD IS IN DANGER AND IT'S UP TO HIM IT'S NOT ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL SO MUCH AS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL BUT WITH THEIR OWN AGENDAS PLUS JORDAN WAS THE FIRST TO HAVE WIDESPREAD SUCCESS WITH WORDBUILDING IN THE MODERN UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM TZOLKIN BUILT A DEEP MYTHOLOGY AND A WORLD WITH A HUGE AMOUNT OF HISTORY BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A LIVING FUNCTIONING WORLD MY EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT IT'S RATHER DIFFICULT TO PICTURE THE BOLDO IN WHO HAS THE JOB UP SCRUBBING THE TOILETS THE WORDBUILDING THAT ROBERT JORDAN PIONEERED AND GUYS LIKE GEORGE RR MARTIN AND TERRY PRITCHETT AND BRANDON SANDERSON DO IS DIFFERENT THEY TRY TO MAKE AN ENTIRE LIVING FUNCTIONING WORLD GEORGE RR MARTIN HAS FAMOUSLY ASKED WHAT TAX POLICY WAS THESE GUYS AND THOSE LIKE THEM HAVE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS LIKE THAT TZOLKIN DID NOT

JORDAN ALSO INTRODUCED A SCALE AND SCOPE THAT DWARFED ANYTHING TZOLKIN DID AND HAS SPAWNED A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE OF ITS OWN THE WHEEL OF TIME SPANS BOOKS AND HAS A CAST OF LITERALLY THOUSANDS WITH DOZENS OF CHARACTERS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED MAJOR ONES THERE'S NO REAL PROTAGONIST SO MUCH AS AN ENSEMBLE WITH PROBABLY A DOZEN PROTAGONISTS OF ROUGHLY EQUAL FOOTING AND IT'S NOT SO MUCH AS GOAL DRIVEN WITH LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF DIVERSIONS ALONG THE WAY

SO JORDAN STARTED THE ERA OF THE FANTASY EPIC WHICH IS STILL ONGOING TO A DEGREE GEORGE RR A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE TERRY SWORD OF TRUTH STEVEN MALAYAN BOOK OF THE FALLEN ARE SOME STANDOUT EXAMPLES OF THIS KIND OF WORK

WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON YOU HAD PEOPLE WRITING BOOKS CALLING BACK TO SOME OLDER TRADITIONS DRAWING MORE FROM FAIRY STORIES THAN THE EPIC POETRY THAT INFLUENCED TZOLKIN SO MUCH NEIL CAIMAN IS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE EVERYONE IN THIS AND IT IS THANKS SOLELY TO HIS GLOWING RECOMMENDATION ON THE COVER THAT I READ HOPE MIRRLEES UNJUSTIFIABLY FORGOTTEN AND SUSANNA JONATHAN STRANGE MR NORRELL IS THE OTHER STANDOUT IN THIS AREA

MORE RECENTLY THINGS HAVE BRANCHED OUT A HUGE AMOUNT TO THE POINT THAT A SERIES LIKE MICHAEL J RIYRIA REVELATIONS IS CONSIDERED REMARKABLE FOR DELIBERATELY HEARKENING BACK TO TZOLKIN THERE IS AN ACTIVE MOVEMENT OF WRITERS UNDERCUTTING THE TROPES THAT TZOLKIN USED AND WERE REPEALED AD NAUSEUM JOE ABERCROMBIE IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST OF THEM I THINK OF HIM AS THE JOKER OF FANTASY WRITERS SOME MEN JUST WANT TO WATCH THE TROPES BURN HELL THE VERY FIRST BOOK OF HIS FIRST LAW TRILOGY BEGINS WITH COGEN NINEFINGERS REFLECTING ON HIS COOKOUT IT'S BEEN HIS FAITHFUL COMPANION THROUGH THE YEARS HE'S KEPT IT BY HIS SIDE WHEN OTHER COMPANIONS HAVE COME AND GONE SOUNDS RATHER LIKE SAM DOESN'T IT EXCEPT HE PROMPTLY AND WITH NO CEREMONY LEAVES IT BEHIND RUSTING AWAY IN THE RAIN BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO CARRY A WOUNDED MAN WITH HIM YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THESE THINGS AND IT'S JUST A COOKOUT

BUT THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF A VERY BIG ICEBERG WE'RE IN A GOLDEN AGE OF FANTASY LITERATURE RIGHT NOW WITH AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL AND INTERESTING STUFF BEING WRITTEN SCOTT OCEAN'S INSPIRED BOOKS ABOUT A PAIR OF THIEVES AND COGMEN PULLING OFF HEIST AFTER HEIST JIM BOOKS ABOUT A WIZARD PI IN CHICAGO GUY GABRIEL BOOKS THAT ARE BASED OFF OF REAL HISTORY WITH A QUARTER TURN TOWARDS THE FANTASTIC WARNING ONLY READ BOOKS IF YOU AREN'T TOO ATTACHED TO YOUR HEART HE'LL RIP THAT THING RIGHT OUT OF YOUR CHEST AND SHATTER IT INTO A THOUSAND PIECES ROBIN COBB LOOKING AT ALL THE PEOPLE EGK HAS MADE CRY AND SAYING I REALLY GOTTA GET IN ON THAT AND MAKING YOU LOVE CHARACTERS DEEPLY JUST SO SHE CAN DO HORRIBLE HORRIBLE THINGS TO THEM MAX GLADSTONE BRINGING FANTASY INTO THE CORPORATE BOARDROOM I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT WATER USAGE RIGHTS AND GENTRIFICATION WOULD MAKE FOR SUCH FASCINATING FANTASY BOOKS

I COULD TALK FOR HOURS REALLY I'LL JUST PUT A GENERAL SUGGESTION TO COME TO R FANTASY WHERE WE HAVE A SERIOUS AUTHOR INFESTATION AND YOU'LL QUICKLY FIND YOUR LIST BALLOONING TO MONSTROUS SIZE
ARE THERE ANY EXAMPLES OF CONTEMPORARY FANTASY THAT DON'T OWE A DEBT TO MIDDLE EARTH

THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS OUT THERE THAT AREN'T VERY MUCH LIKE TZOLKIN

FANTASY

HERE'S KIND OF WHERE THE PROBLEM SHOWS UP

THERE ARE A LOT OF FANTASY WORKS OUT THERE THAT TRY TO FIT INTO THE SAME MOLD AS WORK DOES YOUR FANTASY SETTING HAVE ELVES DWARVES AND ORCS IF SO YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO EITHER BE DERIVATIVE OF TZOLKIN IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER OR GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY TO BE SUBVERTING THE CLICHES BUILT UP AROUND SUCH FANTASY RACES IF YOU AREN'T SPECIFICALLY TRYING TO INVOKE TZOLKIN WHY DO YOU HAVE THESE OTHER RACES AT ALL

LOOK AT BRANDON SANDERSON MISBORN AND THE STORMTIGHT ARCHIVE BOTH HAVE ENEMY RACES BUT NEITHER ARE VERY OARFISH THEY ALSO BOTH HAVE VARIED ENOUGH SETTINGS TO GET AROUND THAT EUROPE FEELING AND MAGIC SYSTEMS WITH AN ACTUAL SYSTEM BEHIND THEM THAT THE AUDIENCE IS PRIVY TO

STEVEN BOOKS SET ON DRAGAERA HAVE BOTH A LONG-LIVED BETTER THAN YOU MAGICALLY ACTIVE RACE AND A STAND-OFFISH SHORT RACE OF MASTER CRAFTSMEN BUT THEY FALL FAR ENOUGH AFIELD OF WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY CONSIDER FOR ELF OR DWARF AS TO NOT REALLY FEEL LIKE TZOLKIN THEY ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT ENOUGH SETTING MOSTLY URBAN FOR THE MAIN SERIES AT LEAST AT FIRST METAPHYSICS AND DELIVERY SMARTASS BEING COINED TO DESCRIBE HIS MAIN SERIES AND THE OTHER SERIES INTENTIONALLY MIMICKING ALEXANDRE DUMAS AS TO PROVIDE DISTANCE

PATRICK ROTHFUSS KING-KILLER CHRONICLE HAS ELVES IN THE KIND OF OTHERWORLDLY FAIRY TYPE RATHER THAN HUMANS BUT OTHERWISE SEEMS TO BE STICKING TO JUST HUMANS OH WE NEED A SOCIETY OF MERCENARIES FOR OUR PROTAGONIST TO LIVE WITH FOR A WHILE SO HE CAN LEARN THEIR FANCY FIGHTING STYLE BUT INSTEAD OF THEM BEING A DIFFERENT RACE AS D D WOULD HAVE IT THEY'RE JUST A FOREIGN CULTURE
GO LOOK AT STUFF THAT WAS INFLUENCED BY HP HOVERCRAFT EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS AND OTHERS IN THE PULP GENRE GO LOOK AT TH WHITE GO LOOK AT COUNTY SOUTH LEWIS GO LOOK AT INFLUENCES LIKE WILLIAM MORRIS LORD DUNSANY GEORGE MACDONALD AND H RIDER HAGGARD
TZOLKIN AND LEWIS AND CAROL PRETTY MUCH PAVED THE WAY FOR MODERN FANTASY SO IN A SENSE ALL CONTEMPORARY FANTASY AUTHORS OWE A DEBT TO THEM THERE WERE A LOT A AUTHORS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEM TRYING TO MODEL WHAT THEY DID AND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DERIVATIVE WORKS WHICH FRANKLY AREN'T VERY GOOD BUT THERE ARE NOW A LOT OF AUTHORS DOING THEIR OWN THING AND WHILE ALMOST ALL ARE NO DOUBT INFLUENCED BY TZOLKIN MANY ARE DIFFERENT ENOUGH THAT I'D SAY YOU CAN ESCAPE TZOLKIN CHECK OUT R FANTASY FOR RECOMMENDATIONS I BELIEVE THEY HAVE A WEEKLY RECOMMENDATION THREAD

BUT SOME GOOD PLACES TO START ARE PROBABLY SCOTT LYNCH PATRICK ROTHFUSS MARK LAWRENCE BRANDON SANDERSON AND OF COURSE THE MORE POP CULTURE FAMOUS GRR MARTIN AND NEIL CAIMAN THERE ALSO STEVEN ERIKSON AND HIS MALAN SERIES THOUGH THAT SOMEWHAT LIKE MARTIN IS QUITE LONG
TZOLKIN HAS SATURATED FANTASY ONLY IF ONE'S EXPOSURE TO THE GENRE IS KNEE DEEP AND THROUGH POPULAR CULTURE

ANY ACTIVE D D PLAYER SHOULD AT LEAST TAKE A LOOK AT APPENDIX N AND SEE WHAT INSPIRED EARLY D D SOME OF THE STUFF THERE PREDATES TZOLKIN AND HE IS ONLY ONE INFLUENCE
I AM ASSUMING IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

JOSEPH JAMES


ODDITIES THE CHARACTER BEING USED HERE FOR THE J SOUND IS TYPICALLY USED IN THE ENGLISH MODES FOR THE H SOUND LIKE AT THE BEGINNING OF GENRE OR THE S IN MEASURE THE LETTER SHOULD HAVE THE LONG STEM POINTING DOWN INSTEAD OF UP TO GET THE SAME SOUND THAT TZOLKIN USED FOR THE J IN HIS OWN FIRST NAME JOHN ON THE TITLE PAGE OF LOAR

ALSO AND THIS IS JUST TO POINT IT OUT THE LAST LETTER IN THE FIRST WORD IS THE F SOUND EVEN THOUGH THE NAME WOULD NORMALLY USE PH IN VERSIONS OF IT THIS IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS THE CORRECT USAGE ANYWAY DUE TO THE NONSENSICAL NATURE OF A LOT OF ENGLISH ORTHOGRAPHY

FINALLY THE NUMBERS MATCH HOW WE WOULD WRITE IT BUT THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT ELVES WOULD HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NUMERAL ON THE RIGHT SO WOULD BE WRITTEN AS BUT THEY ALSO OFTEN USE A BASE NUMBER SYSTEM SO IF HE WANTED TO REPRESENT THE BASE NUMBER PROPERLY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AS THIS WOULD ONLY MATTER TO LIKE ME THOUGH AND THE WAY HE'S GOT IT ARRANGED IS DEFINITELY EASIER TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE

HERE ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITES SOURCES ARE THE CAST COMMENTARIES AND BEHIND THE SCENES STUFF FROM THE EXTENDED EDITIONS

VIGO MORTENSEN GETTING STOPPED BY POLICE ON THE STREET IN WELLINGTON AFTER A STUNT REHEARSAL HE WAS APPARENTLY GOING OVER HIS SWORD CHOREOGRAPHY ON THE WAY TO HIS CAR VIGO CARRIED HIS SWORD EVERYWHERE HE WENT DURING FILMING

SEAN BEAN IS AFRAID OF FLYING HE HIKED TO THE AMON SUL SET IN FULL COSTUME

THE HOBBIT ACTORS SHARED A MAKEUP TRAILER WITH SIR IAN MCKELLEN THEY PLAYED HEAVY METAL MUSIC DURING AM MAKE UP CALLS SIR IAN WAS NOT AMUSED

JOHN RHYS DAVIES IS MISSING PART OF A FINGER DUE TO A ACCIDENT ON A FARM AS A TEENAGER HE HAD WETA MAKE A PROTESTHIC FILLED WITH FAKE BLOOD AND THEN PRANKED PETER JACKSON INTO THINKING HE HAD ACCIDENT ON SET

IN BETWEEN TAKES THE ELVES AND ORCS WHEN THEY SHOT HELMS DEEP THE ELVES AND ORCS WOULD TAUNT EACH OTHER VIA MAORI HAKKA

MORTENSEN BOUGHT THE HORSE THAT PLAYED BEGO AND ALSO BOUGHT THE HORSE THAT PLAYED ASFALOF HE GAVE THE HORSE THAT PLAYED ASFLALOF TO LIV STYLERS RIDING DOUBLE

SEAN ASTIN LIKED TO PLAY CHESS AGAINST HIS SCALE DOUBLE DURING BREAKS IN FILMING THE DOUBLE WOULD BE WEARING FACIAL LOOK LIKE ASTIN SO IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS PLAYING A MINI VERSION OF HIMSELF

NEVER GO CANOEING WITH ORLANDO BLOOM AND JOHN RHYS DAVIES YOU END UP IN THE WATER

CHRISTOPER LEE WORKED FOR BRITISH INTELLIGENCE DURING WORLD WAR 2 AND CORRECTED JACKSON ON WHAT TYPE OF SOUND A MAN STABBED IN THE BACK WOULD A MAKE
WHEN BILLY BOYD PIPPIN AND DOMINIC MONAGHAN MERRY ARE CAUGHT ON CAMERA COMPARING THEIR PRECIOUSES
BILLY BOYD AND DOMINIC MONAGHAN MAKING UP THAT TAG GAME CAST COMMENTARIES IN GENERAL
NOT REALLY BTS BUT I LIKE ANY OF THE MAKING OF VIDEOS ESPECIALLY SHOWING THE FORCED PERSPECTIVE WORK THEY DID
THE FAKE GAME OF TIG
THE PRETEND FIGHT DOM AND BILLY HAVE WHEN THEY ARE LEARNING TO ROW
THE STORY OF VIGO CATCHING A FISH AND ONE OF THE SCALE ACTORS KIERAN YELLING AT HIM AND ORDERING HIM ABOUT IN THE KITCHEN WHILE THEY MAKE FOOD
THE STORY OF HOW DOM GETS A SPLINTER IN HIS FOOT
THERE WAS A FAKE TAKE OF THEOWMEN TALKING TO ARAGON AND BERNARD GOES AWAY FROM THE SCRIPT AND JUST SAYS WHATEVER FOR LIKE MINUTES WHILE VIGO IS CONFUSED AS HELL

THERE ARE JUST SO MANY LOL
DEFINE BTS
THIS IS A TOUGH ONE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOOSOO MANY AWESOME PLACES I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN REAL LIFE I THINK OSGILIATH IS UP THERE FOR ME RIVENDELL WOULD BE AS WELL I AM ALSO FASCINATED BY WHAT MORIA AND ERECTOR WOULD LOOK LIKE TOO
DOES COUNT BEING AND ALL IF IT COUNTS THEN

OR MAYBE MINAS TIGRISH

OR RIVENDELL

OR THE SHIRE WOULD BE NICE

OH HELL JUST ALL OF IT
CARAS GALADHON BUILT UP IN THE TALL REDWOODS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE AWESOME OR RIVENDELL ALONG AN NORTHERN EAST COAST RIVER TUCKED IN THE NATURE OF IT ALL I LIKE TREES
CONDOR
BESIDES MANY OF THOSE ALREADY MENTIONED I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE ARGONAUT
A HOBBIT HOLE
WITHOUT A DOUBT MINAS TIGRISH
THE FILM VERSION OF RIVENDELL I'D WORK AS A JANITOR IF I COULD LIVE THERE
RIVENDELL
GONDOLIER OR NARGOTHROND
HOBBITON OR MINAS TIGRISH
SO I'M CURIOUS DID YOU READ THE HOBBIT WORD FOR WORD OR DID YOU SKIP OVER ANY PARTS I TRIED READING IT TO MY DAUGHTER AND I THINK SHE GOT HUNG UP TOO MUCH ON THE LONG DESCRIPTIONS
HEY HO TO THE BOTTLE I GO
TO HEAL MY HEART AND DROWN MY WOE
RAIN MAY FALL AND WIND MAY BLOW BUT THERE'LL STILL BE
MANY MILES TO GO

SWEET IS THE SOUND OF THE POURING RAIN
AND THE STREAM THAT FALLS FROM HILL TO PLAIN
BETTER THAN RAIN OR RIPPLING BROOK
IS A MUG OF BEER INSIDE THIS TOOK

O WATER COLD WE MAY POUR AT NEED
DOWN A THIRSTY THROAT AND BE GLAD INDEED
BUT BETTER IS BEER IF DRINK WE LACK
TO LIFT ALL BURDENS OFF OUR BACKS

THEN UNDER A TALL TREE I WILL LIE
AND LET THE CLOUDS GO SAILING BY
I'LL DREAM OF TREES AND HILLS AND GRASS
AND GOLDEN ALE IN MUGS OF GLASS

HEY HO TO THE BOTTLE I GO
TO HEAL MY HEART AND DROWN MY WOE
RAIN MAY FALL AND WIND MAY BLOW BUT THERE'LL STILL BE
MANY MILES TO GO
PETER HOLLERS AND HANK GREEN HAVE A GOOD MEDLEY
YOU SHOULD GO LOOK FOR THE MIDDLE EARTH ALBUM FROM GLASS HAMMER I'LL JUST COPY AND PASTE A LINK TO ONE OF THEM HERE


WATCH V

I LIKE IT ONLY THING THAT HIGH CLAP I'D USE SOMETHING WITH A DEEPER RESONANCE A DOOM DOOM INSTEAD OF A CLAP DRUMS IN THE DEEP
BRIEFLY THOUGHT IT BEEN MY WIFI I'M IN SK BUT MY WIFI IS
MINE IS MINAS TIGRISH WIFI
RUN YOU FOOLS AND YOU SHALL NOT PASS
YOU CANNOT BUY THE TEXT IN PDF FORMAT AND LINKS TO ILLEGAL COPIES ARE NOT PERMITTED HERE

TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU WANT YOU'D HAVE TO FIND A CUSTOM BOOKBINDER WHO CAN TAKE AN EXISTING VOLUME AND BIND IT THE WAY YOU WANT YOU COULD THEN INCLUDE SPECIFIC IMAGES BUT THESE WOULD HAVE TO BE PRINTED AT THE CORRECT SIZE FIRST

BASICALLY IT CAN BE DONE BUT IT'S LIKELY TO BE PRETTY EXPENSIVE
I TESTIFY TO EVERYONE WHO HEARS THE PROPHETIC WORDS OF THIS BOOK IF ANYONE ADDS TO THEM GOD WILL ADD TO HIM THE PLAGUES THAT ARE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK REVELATION ON YOUR OWN HEAD BE IT LOL

PUT A RING ON IT PUN INTENDED
GIRLFRIEND

BKS THAT'S PRETTY CUTE
GLAD THAT YOU LIKED THE HOBBIT BOOK NOW YOU NEED TO CARVE OUT SOME TIME TO READ THE LOAR TRILOGY I READ THE BOOKS BEFORE THE MOVIES CAME OUT AND WHEN GANDALF BIDS FAREWELL TO THE HOBBITS AT THE GREY HAVENS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER CRIED WHILE READING A BOOK IT'S JUST SO WONDERFULLY WRITTEN

AS FOR YOUR QUESTIONS I JUST ALWAYS ACCEPTED THAT THE BOOKS WERE MORE ADVENTUROUS HOBBITS THUS MAKING THEM ODD TO THEIR BRETHREN

SMUG WAS THE LAST GREAT DRAGON OF HIS AGE BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE WEREN'T LESSER DRAGONS MILLING ABOUT IN THE NORTHERN WASTES BY THE TIME OF HIS DEATH I DON'T RECALL HEARING OF ANY DRAGONS POPPING UP DURING THE WAR OF THE RING

AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SEEING A VERSION OF THE HOBBIT MUCH CLOSER TO THE BOOK
THAT RUMOUR ABOUT FAIRIES IS PROBABLY JUST A RUMOUR THE HOBBIT IS SUPPOSEDLY WRITTEN BY BILBO HIMSELF AND HE MAY HAVE EMBELLISHED HIS STORY A BIT IN LOAR THEY TALK ABOUT BOOK WHICH IS LIKELY AN EARLY DRAFT OF THE HOBBIT THE CONCEIT IS THAT JNR TZOLKIN WAS JUST THE TRANSLATOR OF HISTORICAL TEXTS

NOW THERE IS A PARTIAL EXPLANATION OF WHY THE BOOKS ARE MORE ADVENTUROUS ORIGINALLY THERE WERE THREE CLANS OF HOBBITS THE BEARFOOTS THE FALLOHIDES AND THE SPOORS THEY HAVE SINCE MERGED BUT THE IMPORTANT FAMILIES AND LEADERS ARE LARGELY OF FALLOHIDE DESCENT AND THEY ARE THE MORE ADVENTUROUS AND BOLD HOBBITS THE FALLOHIDES WERE ALSO KNOWN FOR HAVING CONTACT WITH THE ELVES AND THAT GOES FOR BILBO AND FRODO AS WELL

IT ISN'T APPARENT FROM THE MOVIES BUT FRODO BAGGIES PIPPIN TOOK AND MERRY BRANDYBUCK ARE ALL FROM THE MOST POSH FAMILIES IN THE SHIRE AND THEY ARE CLOSELY RELATED I THINK ALL THREE ARE DESCENDED FROM THE OLD TOOK EVEN THOUGH BILBO AND FRODO ARE VERY EGALITARIAN BY SHIRE STANDARDS THEY ARE STILL MORE OR LESS ARISTOCRACY WHILE SAM IS A COMMONER SAM IS ALSO THE ONLY ONE WITH A REAL JOB BEING A GARDENER

BTW REMEMBER HOW THE DWARVES WERE INTRODUCED TO BILBO BY GANDALF ONE BY ONE IT WILL COME UP LATER AND THEY COMPLETELY MISSED THIS IN THE MOVIES
CONCERNING THE DRAGONS SMUG WAS ONLY THE GREATEST OF THE DRAGONS OF HIS DAYS THERE ARE OTHER LESSER ONES AND IF I INTERPRETED GANDALFS RIDDLES RIGHT HE WANTED THE DWARFS BACK IN THE LONELY MOUNTAIN SO THAT THEY SHIELD OF BAUDRONS ATTACKS FROM THE NORTH IN THE WAR OF THE RING THINK OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND SAVAGE SWORDS IN ERIADOR NIGHT IN RIVENDELL HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE VICTORY IN DALE SO THERE STILL WERE DRAGONS IN MIDDLE-EARTH IN THE NORTH DURING THE WAR OF THE RING WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS IF IN ALLIANCE WITH SARON
PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I GOT THAT WRONG
ALL WAS QUOTED FORM APPENDIX A FOLK
I CAN'T ACTUALLY COME UP WITH ANY REASONS WHY GANDALF AND DUMBLEDORE WOULD BE FIGHTING

BOTH SEEM LIKE THE SIT DOWN AND TALK IT OUT TYPE TO ME I THINK THEY'D GET ALONG WONDERFULLY
I'M NOT SURE BUT GANDALF AS HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS WOULD BE GREAT

YOU SHALL NOT PASS
AT LEAST GANDALF IS STILL ALIVE
ARE YOU STRONGER THAN YOUR FRIEND IF SO BEAT HIM UP AND SAY YOU LEARNED FROM GANDALF
THE MAGIC IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN HP VERSUS LOAR I THINK A FEW THINGS TO POINT OUT IS

DUMBLEDORE CAN'T BE CORRUPTED AND GANDALF CAN GANDALF CAN'T TRUST HIMSELF WITH THE RING OF POWER DUMBLEDORE HAD THE THREE MOST POWERFUL KNOWN WIZARD ITEMS WAND CLOAK STONE YET HE WAS UNCORRUPTED BY IT

WE NEVER SEE TRUE POWER BECAUSE HE IS FORCED TO HOLD BACK HE IS ESSENTIALLY AN ANGEL AND 2ND MOST POWERFUL BEING IN MIDDLE EARTH

IN HP VOLDEMORT IS THE MOST POWERFUL EVIL WIZARD AND IS SCARED OF DUMBLEDORE SARON NOT SURE IF SARON GANDALF IS MAIA ISN'T SCARED OF GANDALF


I THINK GANDALF IS MORE POWERFUL BUT IT IS UNFAIR FOR AN ARGUMENT BECAUSE WE NEVER SEE HIS TRUE POWER I WOULD SAY THAT MAGIC HAS EVOLVED QUITE A BIT FROM LOAR TO HP AS FAR AS WE KNOW GANDALF LACKS THE KNOWLEDGE TO TRANSPORT TO VARIOUS PLACES WHERE AS DUMBLEDORE CAN I THINK GANDALF IS MORE DURABLE THOUGH SO I THINK SPELLS ARE MORE POWERFUL BUT I THINK GANDALF MIGHT WIN THE FIGHT WITH HIS DURABILITY
GANDALF AS AN MAIA WAS PROBABLY INVOLVED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MIDDLE EARTH AND HE EXISTED BEFORE EA AND WILL EXIST AFTER EA DUMBLEDORE IS HUMAN AND MORTAL ALSO JUST IN TERMS OF THE SCALE IN WHICH THE CHARACTERS OPERATE ENEMY IS AN AUTHORITARIAN TYRANNICAL BRITISH WIZARD GANDALF IS MATCHED AGAINST THE 2ND IN COMMAND TO EVIL ITSELF GANDALF PLAYS MIDDLE EARTH LIKE A CHESS BOARD DUMBLEDORE IS ONE SOLDIER IN THE RESISTANCE EVEN IF HE DOES USE HARRY IN A WAY THAT PARALLELS USE OF FRODO THE BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH JUST FEELS LARGER
GANDALF ONE'S A GOD AND ONE'S HUMAN
DUMBLEDORE BARELY MANAGED TO KEEP CONTROL OF A SCHOOL AND STILL DIED IN DOING SO GANDALF ALSO DIED BUT CAME BACK A FAR MORE POWERFUL BEING NOT ONLY THAT HE PLAYED ARGUABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ALL OF MIDDLE EARTH DURING HIS TIME

BUFF SAID
HE IS AN IMMORTAL BEING WITH THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF EXPERIENCE OF COURSE HE WOULD BEAT DUMBLEDORE
GANDALF A BARONG

BUFF SAID
I KNOW I'LL GET DOWNVOTED TO OBLIVION BUT MAGIC IS MUCH MORE PRACTICAL IN A STRAIGHT-UP FIGHT APPARITION AND A CRAZY VARIETY OF SPELLS GEARED TOWARDS IMMOBILIZING AN ENEMY GANDALF MAY BE MORE POWERFUL BUT HIS POWER IS MORE GEARED TOWARDS MORALE AND SOME OCCASIONAL FIRE

IF HE WERE ABLE TO UTILIZE HIS POWER AS A MAIA THEN I DOUBT BUMBLES WOULD BE ABLE TO DO MUCH BUT AS GANDALF HE'D LOSE
NOT KNOWING THE TRUE EXTENT OF POWERS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WE SEE HIM DO SOME AMAZING THINGS LIKE FIGHT OFF MULTIPLE RINGWRAITHS GROW TALL LIGHT OBJECTS ON FIRE AND DEFEAT A BARONG AND THAT'S WHILE KEEPING THE MAJORITY OF HIS FULL ABILITIES HIDDEN I WOULD IMAGINE A FULLY EMPOWERED COLORIN WOULD BE BASICALLY UNSTOPPABLE

IT WOULD BE QUITE THE FIGHT
I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REDDITORS THAT THERE IS NO CONCEIVABLE REASON WHY GANDALF AND DUMBLEDORE WOULD EVER FIGHT IF THEY DID FIGHT I IMAGINE GANDALF WOULD SAY DUMBLEDORE YOUR WAND IS BROKEN AND BAM NO MORE WAND NO MORE FIGHT THEY WOULD THEN SHARE SOME LONGBOTTOM LEAF AND PINTS
ACTUALLY GIVEN HIS LIMITATIONS AS AN INSTAR DUMBLEDORE PROBABLY WOULD KILL GANDALF THE GREY GANDALF THE WHITE ON THE OTHER HAND IS A DIFFERENT STORY
SORRY BUT DUMBLEDORE WOULD WIN DID YOU SEE HIM FIGHT TOM RIDDLE THE GUY IS A ONE MAN ARMY
GANDALF IS IMMORTAL AND HAS EAGLES WHAT A SILLY DEBATE
OH GOD I WOULD WATCH THAT
I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING THIS AS AN ANIMATED SERIES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THANK YOU
IND MTV MAKE IT AND IT'S AS CRINGE AS SHANKARA
THIS IS OUTSTANDING IN MY DREAMS IT BECOMES A REALITY

MAKE IT HAPPEN
THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN
VERY IMPRESSIVE
THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I'VE ALWAYS FELT ABOUT THE SILMARILLION
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN I JUST WANT TO SEE A BARONG RIDE A DRAGON IN THE FALL OF GONDOLIER
VERY FEW SHOWS SUCCESSFULLY RUN FOR SEASONS SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A GAMBLE TO ASSUME THEY'D BE ABLE TO RUN FOR YEARS IF IT GOT SHUT DOWN HALFWAY THROUGH IT'D BE ABOUT AS PAINFUL AS FIREFLY
HASN'T THE TZOLKIN PROFESSOR BEEN DOING THIS EXACT THING IN PODCAST FORM
THANKS FOR THE COMMENTS GUYS YOU JUST DOUBLED MY REGULAR MONTHLY VIEWS IN 2 DAYS
I DON'T THINK THAT THE SILMARILLION IS REALLY MEANT TO BE A TV SHOW OR MOVIE AT LEAST IN ITS ENTIRETY TZOLKIN DIDN'T MAKE THE SILMARILLION IT WAS HIS SON WHO DID THE EDITING AND SCRAPPING TOGETHER OF THE MILLIONS OF STORIES THAT HIS FATHER WROTE SO INSTEAD OF HAVING THE SILMARILLION THE MOVIE I'D LOVE TO SEE EACH INDIVIDUAL STORY IN THE SILMARILLION TAKE ITS OWN MOVIE OR SHOW THE AKALLABÊTH OR THE FALL OF NÚMENOR COULD EASILY TAKE UP A THREE HOUR MOVIE OR THE RISE AND FALL OF THE CITY OF GONDOLIER WORLD WAS SO AMAZINGLY EXPANSIVE AND GRANDIOSE THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME IN HIS LIFE TO WRITE IT ALL DOWN SO I THINK THERE COULD BE A LOT OF ROOM FOR SOME GREAT INTERPRETATIONS OF HIS WORK AND FILLING IN THE HOLES OF THE STORY OF GONDOLIER OR SOME SUCH WE GET STORY ARCS AND SELECT KEY CONVERSATIONS BUT THERE IS STILL TONS OF ROOM FOR PLOT AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK I THINK A TRULY DEVOUT TZOLKIN FAN COULD PULL IT OFF SO LONG AS HE SHE REMAINS TRUE TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL INSTEAD OF SELLING OUT AND MAKING THREE SHITTY MOVIES ENTIRELY FOR THE SAKE OF PROFIT AND REBOOTING A POPULAR FRANCHISE COUGH THE HOBBIT COUGH
I AM NOT AT ALL READY FOR A REMAKE OF THE TRILOGY HONESTLY IT IS ONE OF THOSE FILMS THAT NEARED PERFECTION THESE TYPE OF FILMS GODFATHER TAXI DRIVER CITIZEN KANE STAR WARS ETC THAT HAVE NEARLY ACHIEVED PERFECTION ARE NOT WORTH REMAKING ONTO OUR CURRENT MODEL OF FILM ONCE THE NEXT WAVE TAKES OVER LIKE TRUE 3D HOLOCHAMBERS AND OTHER SPACE ABEY SHIT THEN THESE FILMS WILL GET THAT MUCH DESERVED SECOND LIFE UNTIL THEN A REMAKE IS NOT NEEDED NOR WORTHWHILE BOTH FINANCIALLY AND CRITICALLY
LOAR DOESN'T NEED A REMAKE BUT THE HOBBIT SERIES DOES
NO
A NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE HOBBIT WOULD BE NICE AS I FEEL THE TRILOGY ADAPTATION WAS PRETTY HORRIBLE SINCE THAT IS SO RECENT THOUGH I REALIZE THAT WILL BE AWHILE IF EVER

I'D BE OPEN TO A NEW ADAPTATION OF LOAR IT'S JUST THAT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO TOP OR EVEN EQUAL THE ORIGINAL
SURE WHY NOT COULD BE TERRIBLE COULD BE GREAT WOULDN'T EFFECT HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE PREVIOUS FILMS OR SOURCE MATERIAL I'D WELCOME NEW ADAPTATIONS OF THE STORIES AND I'D CERTAINLY TAKE REMAKES OF LOAR OVER SOME MADE UP SPIN OFF FILM LOOSELY INSPIRED BY A COUPLE OF LINES IN THE APPENDICES IF ONLY TO SEE HOW A DIFFERENT DIRECTOR WOULD INTERPRET THE SOURCE MATERIAL A LOAR TV SERIES COULD BE INTERESTING I DO LIKE LOAR TRILOGY VERY MUCH BUT HE'S ARGUABLY BECOME AS SYNGAMOUS WITH THE STORY AS TZOLKIN HIMSELF IN POPULAR CULTURE IF A REMAKE WERE TO HAPPEN I'D BE MORE INTERESTING IN SEEING A DIFFERENT SPIN ON THE SOURCE MINISERIES SIX PART LOAR ETC

IRONICALLY MANY FANS OF THE NOVELS CONSIDER THE HOBBIT GRAPHIC NOVEL AND BBC RADIO SERIES OF LOAR TO BE THE MOST FAITHFUL ADAPTATIONS

NEW FILMS WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST LEAD TO MORE DEBATE ABOUT THE MERITS AND FLAWS OF THE PREVIOUS SIX FILMS AND IT HELPS KEEP THE STORIES IN THE PUBLIC EYE AS JACKSON HAS ALREADY PROVED THE NOVELS ARE ADAPTABLE AND STILL POPULAR WITH A MODERN MASS AUDIENCE BEYOND THE EXISTING FANS PERHAPS IT WOULD ENCOURAGE A NEW FILEMAKER TO FOLLOW THEIR OWN PATH OR STICK MORE CLOSELY TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL

AND OF COURSE IF TOM BOBADIL EVER MAKES A SCREEN APPEARANCE BRIAN BLESSED IS THE MAN FOR THE JOB
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SERIES MAYBE EPISODES PER BOOK MINS EACH THAT MAY SEEM LONG BUT MORE LOAR IS FINE BY ME
ID WELCOME A MORE FAITHFUL HOBBIT REDUX I'D BE EVEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A SILMARILION SERIES
IF THEY CAN MAKE ONE MORE ACCURATE NOT LESS THAN THE ONES ALREADY OUT THERE I SAY SURE
IN THE DISTANT FUTURE I'D BE INTERESTED TO SEE IT BUT IT'S STILL TOO SOON
I JUST REMATCHED THE TRILOGY I THINK NOT IN THE NEXT YEARS BUT MAYBE IN THE NEXT OR THERE COULD BE A REMAKE THE MOVIES ARE QUITE WELL DONE BUT I HAVE HOWEVER NOTICED THAT THEY ARE SHOWING THEIR AGE BUT JUST SLIGHTLY

THE CGI IS DATED BY STANDARDS THE FIGHT SCENES ARE TOO CHOPPY FOR FILMS I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S JUST THE EXTENDED EDITION THAT I HAVE BUT THE SOUND OF THE VOICES AND MUSIC ARE NOT PROPERLY ADJUSTED THE MUSIC IS WAY TOO LOUD COMPARED TO THE VOICES THERE'S AN OUTDATED HORROR STYLE ZOOM OUT PERSPECTIVE SHOT OF THE ENTRANCE OF CAVE

THE WHOLE THEME OF THE MOVIE DOESN'T HOLD UP AS WELL TODAY THE THEME OF A BLACK AND WHITE GOOD VS EVIL GLOBAL FEUD MOVIES MAKE A BETTER EFFORT TO EXPLAIN THE MOTIVES AND REASON OF THE BAD GUY IN THIS WAY THE BOOKS ACTUALLY HOLD UP BETTER THAN THE MOVIE IN THE BOOKS THE BATTLE IS NOT SO BLACK AND WHITE AND THE BOOKS EXPLAIN HOW IDEAS SUCH AS FEAR SPEECHES AND PROPAGANDA MOTIVATED THE PEOPLE OF THE LANDS TO FIGHT FOR THE BAD GUY

TO ME THE MOVIES ARE A MASTERPIECE THEY ARE SHOWING SOME AGE A REMAKE WILL COME SOMEDAY AND WE'LL BE LUCKY IF IT HAS THE RECEPTION AS THE ORIGINALS
YES THE MORE LOAR THE BETTER IT WOULD BE COOL TO SEE OTHER PEOPLES PERSPECTIVES ON THE STORY
IT WOULD BE GREAT PERHAPS AN ADAPTATION THAT GOES MORE LIKE THE STORY ACTUALLY IS
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I LOVE IT BUT STILL I PREFER THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP
I DON'T THINK THIS TRACK IS EVEN PART OF THE SOUNDTRACK ALBUM
I HATES IT
THIS SONG IS SUPER CUTE TOO BAD IT'S ONLY IN THE FELLOWSHIP MOVIE FOR LIKE SECONDS
FUN FACT THIS IS THE ONLY SONG THAT ISN'T PLAYED LIVE IF YOU SEE THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS IN CONCERT
FOR THE PAST YEAR OR SO I'VE BEEN GETTING THESE POSTERS SIGNED BY CAST AND CREW MEMBERS THAT WORKED ON LORD OF THE RINGS AND THE HOBBIT SADLY I MISSED RICHARD TAYLOR KARL URBAN AND JOHN RHYS DAVIES

THOUGHT I'D SHARE THESE AMONG FELLOW FANS
ALSO APOLOGIES FOR SOMEWHAT EH QUALITY PHOTOS CONSIDERING REFLECTIONS
I JUST REALIZED HOW PROMINENT ARWEN IS IN THESE POSTERS FUNNY CONSIDERING HER SCREEN TIME
IT ALWAYS ANNOYED ME THAT THE FELLOWSHIP POSTER SHOWS ARAGON IN HIS HELMS DEEP GEAR
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING AND HOW CAN WE BE FRIENDS
HEY KEEP IN MIND THAT THE LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIES ARE A LOT SLOWER MORE STORY AND DIALOGUE BUT GAVE BETTER ACTION IN MY OPINION IF YOU REALLY LIKED THE HOBBIT MOVIES THEN YOU WILL ADORE LOTS OF THE RINGS
WHILE I'M REALLY GLAD YOU ENJOYED THEM I HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION PERSONALLY I THINK THE THIRD HOBBIT MOVIE IS A MASSIVE PILE OF FLAMING DOG SHIT THAT IS PROBABLY TOO DISGUSTING TO EVEN FIT IN AT THE LOCAL DUMP THANKFULLY THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS BETTER IN EVERY SINGLE ASPECT CASTING SCRIPTING STORYBOARDING CINEMATOGRAPHY SCORE EVERYTHING IF YOU LIKED THE HOBBIT YOU SHOULD LOVE THE LORD OF THE RINGS

ALSO IF YOU ARE LIKING THE SERIES I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING THE BOOKS PETER LORD OF THE RINGS IS AN INCREDIBLE CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE BUT THEY ARE PALE SHADOWS COMPARED TO THEIR ORIGINAL SOURCE MATERIAL

WELCOME TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF ARDA
THE HOBBIT TRILOGY HAS OF FICTIONAL JACKSON MATERIAL

THE HOBBIT IS ACTUALLY A CHILD BOOK THINNER THAN A SINGLE LOAR BOOK
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THE LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIES THEY'RE BETTER IN EVERY WAY THAN THE HOBBIT MOVIES AND YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE HATING ON THE HOBBIT MOVIES BUT DON'T WORRY IF YOU LIKE THEM YOU LIKE THEM AND BE HAPPY WE JUST HATE THEM BECAUSE WE ALL READ THE BOOK AND IMAGINED THE PERFECT MOVIE IN OUR HEADS AND THOSE MOVIES WEREN'T IT
PLEASE LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF LOAR WHEN YOU'VE SEEN IT I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON IT WOULD BE SEEING IT AFTER THE HOBBIT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER INSTEAD OF BEFORE IN FILMMAKING ORDER
OH WOW ARE YOU IN FOR A TREATISE I'M SORT OF GLAD YOU WATCHED THE HOBBIT FIRST THAT'S SETS THE BAR REALLY LOW FOR LOAR THOSE MOVIES ARE MUCH MUCH BETTER
I'M GENUINELY INTERESTED IN YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE LOAR TRILOGY HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM HOW DO THEY COMPARE TO THE HOBBIT ARE YOU GLAD YOU SAW THE HOBBIT FIRST
CHRISTOPHER DID ADD A TON OF J ROYAL ROYAL TOLKIENS WRITINGS ON THE UNIVERSE AFTER DEATH MOST PEOPLE HOWEVER THINK THAT TOLKIENS MYTHOLOGY IS TIMELESS AND HAVING OTHER AUTHORS BESIDES CHRISTOPHER OBVIOUSLY ADD TO IT WOULD DESECRATE HIS LEGACY

PERSONALLY I WOULD CRY IF LORD OF THE RINGS GOT TRANSFORMED INTO SOME SORT OF STAR WARS STYLE EXTENDED UNIVERSE NO A LARGE PART OF THE MAGIC OF MIDDLE EARTH IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING IT SHOULD STAY THAT WAY
THE TZOLKIN ESTATE HAS NOT AND WILL NOT SANCTION A SEQUEL NOVEL JNR TZOLKIN APPOINTED HIS OLDEST SON CHRISTOPHER AS LITERARY EXECUTOR AND GAVE HIM COMPLETE FREEDOM IN HIS WILL TO

PUBLISH EDIT ALTER REWRITE OR COMPLETE ANY WORK OF MINE
WHICH MAY BE UNPUBLISHED AT MY DEATH OR TO DESTROY THE WHOLE
OR ANY PART OR PARTS OF ANY SUCH UNPUBLISHED WORKS AS HE
IN HIS ABSOLUTE DISCRETION MAY THINK FIT AND SUBJECT THERETO

WHILST CHRISTOPHER AND OTHERS HAVE EDITED NUMEROUS VOLUMES OF EXTENSIVE PREVIOUSLY UNPUBLISHED MATERIAL STORIES AND ALTERNATE DRAFTS SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE SILMARILLION IN THE TZOLKIN ESTATE HAS TAKEN A STRICTLY EDITORIAL POSITION WITH NEW TZOLKIN BOOKS I E WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EDITORS COMMENTS AND ANALYSIS VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE POSTHUMOUSLY PUBLISHED MATERIAL WAS WRITTEN BY JNR TZOLKIN HIMSELF NO NEW STORIES WILL BE FORTHCOMING AS THE ESTATE JUST ISN'T INTERESTED IN CASHING IN IN THAT WAY

TZOLKIN DID BRIEFLY CONSIDER A SEQUEL STORY TO LOAR BUT ABANDONED IT OF ONLY A FEW PAGES

WIKI
THERE'S ALWAYS FAN FICTION
NO AND HOPEFULLY NEVER WILLIAM IN HIS OWN LIFETIME TZOLKIN RECEIVED LETTERS WITH PEOPLE ASKING SOME KIND OF OFFICIAL PERMISSION TO WRITE SEQUELS OR THEIR OWN STORIES ANSWER WAS CLEAR

SOME FOLK TEND TO QUOTE ONE SINGLE PASSAGE FROM LETTERS TO JUSTIFY EXPANDING IT IS A PASSAGE WHERE TZOLKIN WRITES THAT HE ONCE HAD A DREAM ABOUT CREATING A MYTHOLOGY FOR ENGLAND TO WHICH OTHERS MIGHT ADD MUSIC ART ETC BUT THE STRESS IS ON ONCE HAD AND HE THEN CONSIDERS THE IDEA ABSURD AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT QUOTE ALSO DEALT WITH BOOK OF LOST TALES WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY PART OF LATER MIDDLE-EARTH AS FAR AS I CAN TELL

ALSO WHAT YOU SUGGEST WOULD TURN THE MIDDLE-EARTH INTO AN OVERCROWDED PLASTIC SUPERFICIAL UNIVERSE IT WOULD BECOME SOME SORT OF STAGE FOR FEELINGS AND IDEAS OF EACH NEW WRITER IT WOULD SEIZE TO BE A PRODUCT OF JNR TZOLKIN AND HIS IDEAS AND DREAMS HOPES AND FEARS ONE WORD EWWWW
WHAT IS THE THIRD ONE

I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT
NOT FOR REFL
HERES MORE
THOSE ARE SMUDGES
THESE WERE LIKE ON THE REDDIN GIFTS FOR SECRET SANTA
LOST ME AT PRINTED ID RATHER HAVE INK ON PARCHMENT AND PAY THE PRICE

TO BE FAIR IT'S PRETTY WELL JUSTIFIED HE IS BY FAR THE OLDEST WISEST AND JUST ALL-AROUND SMARTEST MEMBER OF THE PARTY I MEAN LIKE NOT BY A LITTLE BIT THERE'S A PRETTY INCOMPREHENSIBLE GAP IN THE LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE BETWEEN A MAIA AND SOME FAIRLY YOUNG AND COMMON DWARVES OR HOBBITS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE SAURURAN AND SARON YOU WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND ANYONE IN MIDDLE-EARTH WITH KNOWLEDGE BASE AND THERE ARE NONE WITH HIS WISDOM

LIKES TO CONFUSE PEOPLE BY TALKING IN RIDDLES OR HALF TRUTHS

RIDDLES YES I DON'T REALLY SEE MANY SITUATIONS IN WHICH HE SPEAKS IN HALF TRUTHS


AND SEEMS TO BE VERY MANIPULATIVE

IF YOU MEAN THAT HE GUIDES THE ACTIONS OF MANY IN MIDDLE-EARTH BOTH THE GREAT AND THE SMALL THEN YES ABSOLUTELY THAT'S HIS ENTIRE PURPOSE FOR BEING TO INSPIRE THOSE AROUND HIM TO ACTION AT NEED

YOU SEEM TO BE USING THE WORD IN A NEGATIVE MANNER THOUGH SO I'D BE INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT YOU MEAN


HE'S JUST GRUMPY
HE'S A GRUMPY GRANDPA LOVES YOU IS WISE AND IS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR BEST INTERESTS BUT HE'LL TALK SOME SHIT IF IT COMES TO IT

ONE OF MY FAVORITE BITS IS EARLY ON IN FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING I THINK IT'S THE SHADOW OF THE PAST CHAPTER FRODO IS LIKE WHY WAS I CHOSEN FOR THIS TASK AND GANDALF RESPONDS WITH SOMETHING LIKE REST ASSURED IT WAS NOT DUE TO GREAT STRENGTH OR WISDOM THAT YOU WERE CHOSEN

DAMN GANDALF ICE COLD
DO NOT MEDDLE IN THE AFFAIRS OF WIZARDS FOR THEY ARE SUBTLE AND QUICK TO ANGER

YEAH HE'S KIND OF A DICK LOL
NOT NEGATIVE I JUST FIND IT RATHER AMUSING THAT'S ALL MY FIRST VIEWINGS OF THE ORIGINAL LOAR YEARS AGO I NEVER REALLY NOTICED SOME OF THESE TRAITS SIR IAN MCKELLENS PORTRAYAL ALWAYS SEEMED SO KIND THE BOOKS DEFINITELY ADD MORE TO THE CHARACTER

ALSO I THINK PERSONALLY I PREFER THE MOVIE ADAPTATION OF THE HOBBIT A BIT MORE THAN THE BOOKS THE MOVIE HAS A REAL SENSE OF CONFLICT AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHILE THE BOOK SEEMS MORE OF A WHIMSICAL FANTASY JOURNEY
MY FAVORITE IS IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE HOBBIT WHEN BILBO DROPS SOMETHING DURING THE FEAST AND GANDALF SAYS SOMETHING LIKE HUSH LET THORIN SPEAK

IT'S TOTALLY POSSIBLE THAT THE HUSH ISN'T IN REACTION TO BILBO DROPPING THE PLATES OR WHATEVER IT IS HE DROPS BUT I LIKE TO PREFER IT IS LOL
GANDALF TO FRODO IN THE SHADOW OF THE PAST

OH YES HE CAME OUT HIS LONGING FOR THE RING PROVED STRONGER THAN HIS FEAR OF ORCS OR EVEN OF THE LIGHT AFTER A YEAR OR TWO HE LEFT THE MOUNTAINS YOU SEE THOUGH STILL BOUND BY DESIRE OF IT THE RING WAS NO LONGER DEVOURING HIM HE BEGAN TO REVIVE A LITTLE HE FELT OLD TERRIBLY OLD YET LESS TIMID AND HE WAS MORTALLY HUNGRY

BIBIO
BIBIO MIGHT BE THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE SEEN ALL WEEK

IT'S BEEN A SLOW WEEK
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT

I THINK TROLLS WOULD PROBABLY LAST A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND IT WOULD TAKE MORE BOILING OIL WATER TO KILL ONE BUT I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE THEM IMMUNE TO BEING BURNED
THANKS I WAS JUST WONDERING
STARTING AT AND LOOPING INTO GLAMOURING THE ENTIRE TIME
I BELIEVE IT'S THE BRIDGE OF
SWIFT JUSTICE IS SO OP
J ROYAL R TZOLKIN DIED IN REVERSE THAT AND IT'S RINGS FOR THE UNDER THE SKY RINGS FOR THE IN THEIR HALLS OF STONE FOR MORTAL MEN DOOMED TO DIE FOR THE DARK LORD ON HIS DARK THRONE
FRODO
DID ANYONE REALLY THINK THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FANTASY WRITER OF ALL TIME WOULD SOMEHOW SOMEDAY BE FORGOTTEN
THIS IS FROM A LETTER HE WROTE ABOUT HIS WIFE AFTER HER DEATH

I NEVER CALLED EDITH LUTHIER BUT SHE WAS THE SOURCE OF THE STORY THAT IN TIME BECAME THE CHIEF PART OF THE SILMARILLION IT WAS FIRST CONCEIVED IN A SMALL WOODLAND GLADE FILLED WITH HEMLOCKS AT ROOS IN YORKSHIRE WHERE I WAS FOR A BRIEF TIME IN COMMAND OF AN OUTPOST OF THE HUMBER GARRISON IN AND SHE WAS ABLE TO LIVE WITH ME FOR A WHILE IN THOSE DAYS HER HAIR WAS RAVEN HER SKIN CLEAR HER EYES BRIGHTER THAN YOU HAVE SEEN THEM AND SHE COULD SING AND DANCE BUT THE STORY HAS GONE CROOKED I AM LEFT AND I CANNOT PLEAD BEFORE THE INEXORABLE BANDOS

AND NEITHER CAN WE
AS FOR MYSELF I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN WE WILL BE REUNITED IN THE WEST AND TOGETHER THE CHILDREN OF ILÚVATAR WILL SING THE SECOND MUSIC OF THE AINU AND BEHOLD THE WORKS OF ERU WHERE ALL THINGS WILL BE MADE ANEW
SECRET HE NEVER DIED HE GOT ON THE BOAT
MIDDLE EARTH HAS NO FATHER JUST A DISCOVERER
I LOVE ANY PICTURE OF TZOLKIN SMOKING HIS PIPE HE JUST LOOKS LIKE A REALLY COOL PERSON
WEIRD I SAW THAT EXACT PICTURE ON A PIPE SMOKING WEBSITE YESTERDAY HAD NO IDEA TODAY WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH
HE IS MISSED
TZOLKIN DIED IN BACKWARDS THAT'S

THREE RINGS FOR THE UNDER THE SKY

SEVEN FOR THE IN THEIR HALLS OF STONE

NINE FOR MORTAL MEN DOOMED TO DIE

ONE FOR THE DARK LORD ON HIS DARK THRONE

JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A COOL COINCIDENCE
DELETED
A SAD ANNIVERSARY I ALWAYS LIKE TO REMEMBER THIS POST WHERE A GUY EXPLAINS HOW PERSONAL THE TALE OF BEDEN AND LÚTHIEN WAS TO TZOLKIN IT'S ABOUT THE 4TH COMMENT DOWN THE THREAD
I LOVE HOW HAPPY HE LOOKS IN THIS PICTURE HE IS A VERY KIND HOBBIT I THINK A SHOOR TO BE HONEST
NOT ALL THOSE WHO WANDER ARE LOST
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A COOL PICTURE FOR A JIGSAW PUZZLE SO I MADE IT ONE

LINK COME PLAY AT R REDDITDOESPUZZLES IF YOU WANT
NOT JUST MIDDLE EARTH THAT'S JUST ONE ERA
YEARS TO THE DAY SINCE HE WAS REUNITED WITH HIS LUTHIER REST IN PEACE
ATH OP DO YOU HAVE THIS DATE ON YOUR GOOGLE CALENDAR OR SOMETHING
HUH I WAS READING THE SILMARILLION TODAY AT THE OXFORD EXCHANGE IT FELT STRANGELY APPROPRIATE FOR MORE THAN ONE REASON NOW I KNOW WHY
AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND THIS MAN'S INCREDIBLE WORKS CONTINUE TO INSPIRE ME YEAR AFTER YEAR
I WAS IN TORONTO AT MY FIRST SCIENCE FICTION WORLD CON WHEN SOMEONE CAME IN WITH THE NEWS IT WAS A SHOCK BUT A COMFORT TO BE WITH OTHER TZOLKIN FANS

AT THE TIME I FELT WE HAD LOST NOT ONLY THE PROFESSOR BUT ALL THE WRITING WE WOULD NEVER SEE I THOUGHT WE WOULD NEVER SEE THE SILMARILLION NEVER KNOW ABOUT THE FIRST AGE OR NOUMENON SO IN SPITE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE LOSS I AM AWED TO LOOK BACK AND SEE ALL THE STORIES WE DID STILL RECEIVE
UNPOPULAR FACT ERU ILUVATAR IS ACTUALLY J ROYAL R TZOLKIN

EDIT WELP SORRY GUYS I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE SOME PEOPLE SMILE BUT YET AGAIN THANKS FOR CORRECTING ME
DELETED
WEIRD I SAW THAT EXACT PICTURE ON A PIPE SMOKING WEBSITE YESTERDAY HAD NO IDEA TODAY WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH
DP REF IE DTF PSC REFREID BKCDQ
THE HOBBIT FIRST EDITION FACSIMILE IF IT COMES OUT IN TIME
IT DEPENDS ON HER INTERESTS BUT THERE'S THOUSANDS OF LOAR THEMED MERCHANT

MAYBE ONE OF THOSE MIDDLE EARTH MAP BLANKETS OR IF SHE LIKES TO DRINK DRINK COFFEE LOAR GLASSES I'VE SEEN A BUNCH OF NICE ALTERNATIVE POSTER PRINTS FOR LOAR FRAMED THEY MAKE GOOD SETS BECAUSE THERE'S THREE IF SHE HAS ANY INTEREST IN VIDEO GAMES THERE'S PLENTY OF THEM
I THINK YOU'D HAVE THE BEST LUCK IF YOU TRY AND THINK OF A DIFFERENT GIFT YOU COULD GET HER BLANKET IF SHE'S ALWAYS COLD MUGS IF SHE DRINKS COFFEE CAR VISOR IF HER CAR GETS HOT ETC THEN FIND A LOAR THEMED VERSION THIS SHOWS YOU'RE BEING THOUGHTFUL BY GETTING HER SOMETHING SHE NEEDS AS WELL AS BEING LOAR RELATED

ALSO THERE'S MORE BOOKS THAN THE HOBBIT AND LOAR SO SEE IF SHE HAS ALL OF THOSE THERE'S A COUPLE THAT AREN'T RELATED TO MIDDLE EARTH SO I THINK A NICE GIFT COULD BE ONE OF THOSE BOOKS A MUG SOME COFFEE OR WINE AND A BLANKET YOU COULD PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND SAY IT'S A RELAXATION PRESENT WITH HER FAVORITE STUFF ALL THAT SHOULDN'T RUN YOU MORE THAN
TICKETS TO AN EVENT LIKE THIS



THEY SHOW THE MOVIES BUT WITH A HUGE LIVE ORCHESTRA ITS LIKE THIS

WATCH V

OR THIS BIT

WATCH V JOEHUJ
MY WIFE BOUGHT ME A MAP OF MIDDLE EARTH PRINTED ON CANVAS FOR MY BIRTHDAY A COUPLE YEARS AGO IT'S ONLY ABOUT A FOOT WIDE BUT I LOVE IT
TAKE A LOOK ON THE NOBLE COLLECTION WEBSITE THEY DO A US AND A UK WEBSITE THEY DO OFFICIAL MERCHANDISE FOR THE HOBBIT AND LOAR

IF SHE ALREADY HAS THE EVESTAR PENDANT PERHAPS SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD BE CUTE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HINT TO MY BOYFRIEND TO BUY IT ME FOR 2 YEARS NOW


OR YOU KNOW THERE'S PLENTY SWORD AND DRAGON RELATED ITEMS IF ELDEN THINGS AREN'T PARTICULARLY HER THING
BUT YEAH CHECK OUT THE WEBSITE THERE'S A GOOD VARIETY
ARAGON RODE WITH FATHER HENGEL

FOR CONTEXT

DENETHOR AND ARAGON ARE THE SAME AGE

BOOMIER AND THEODORE ARE FRODO IS OLDER THAN THEY ARE AT

FARAMIR AND MERRY ARE

COMER IS AND ELWYN IS
IN THE MOVIE THEY SAID THAT ARAGON IS OLDER THAN THEOWMEN AND THAT HE USED TO FIGHT BESIDE HIS FATHER AND HE'S YEARS OLD
YES THE MEN OF NÚMENÓR WERE MUCH THAN MIDDLE MEN OR GONDORIANS

FROM

WHILE MOST NÚMENÓREANS LIVED AROUND YEARS ROYAL KINDRED LIVE YEARS THIS LONGER LIFESPAN RESULTED IN AN OLDER AGE OF ADULTHOOD YEARS
YES HE IS ARAGON IS A DÚNADAN OF THE HOUSE HE DIED WHEN HE WAS HE ACTUALLY OUTLIVED A GREAT MANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS BY ABOUT YEARS THE DÚNEDAIN IN THE THIRD AGE AT LEAST DURING THIS PERIOD GENERALLY LIVE ABOUT YEARS TOPS THEY ARE ALSO FULL OF VITALITY DURING MOST OR ALL OF THEIR LIVES THUS A MAN FROM ROHAN AT WHO IS BREAKING DOWN WITH CREAKY JOINTS IS UNLIKE A DÚNADAN WHO'S JUST AS FIT AS HE WAS AT DENETHOR IS A YEAR OLDER THAN ARAGON BUT HE IS SAID TO HAVE AGED PREMATURELY THIS WAS DUE TO HIS USE OF THE PALANTÍR AND PERHAPS ALSO DUE TO HIS STRUGGLES WITH SARON WHILE USING THE PALANTÍR AFTER ARAGON MAKES USE OF IT ALBEIT FOR THE FIRST TIME HE GROWS WEAK

AS IF IN ONE NIGHT MANY YEARS HAD FALLEN ON HIS HEAD GRIM WAS HIS FACE AND WEARY THE PASSING OF THE GREY COMPANY
WE ARE APPARENTLY ARE ALL FORGETTING THAT ARAGON IS THE HEIR OF NOUMENON AND THEREFORE HAS A LONGER LIFE THAN THE REST OF THE MORTALS IN MIDDLE EARTH ALTHOUGH THE LINE HAS BEEN SPREAD THIN IN THE WANING YEARS
ALL OF THE TZOLKIN MIDDLE-EARTH BOOKS ARE

THE HOBBIT

LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING THE TWO TOWERS THE RETURN OF THE KING

THE SILMARILLION

UNFINISHED TALES

THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH

THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN
U EBNETER HAS A WONDERFUL POST WITH EVERYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY WISH TO KNOW IN IT

R LOAR COMMENTS


ONE THING THAT I PERSONALLY WOULD ADD THOUGH IS THAT YOU REALLY REALLY SHOULD READ THE SILMARILLION MORE THAN ONCE AND PREFERABLY MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO READ HOME OR UNFINISHED TALES EVERYTHING WILL MAKE FAR MORE SENSE IF YOU'VE READ IT THE SILMARILLION TWICE OR MORE
THE ROAD GOES EVER ON WAS A MUSIC BOOK I FORGET WHO BUT A MUSICIAN GOT JNR APPROVAL TO PUT THE SONGS IN LOAR DOWN TO MUSIC I DON'T THINK IT'S IN PRINTING MY MOM SCOURED THE INTERNET AND GOT ME A COPY A FROM A ON ONLINE BOOK RESELLER SHOP ONE OF MY PRIZE POSSESSIONS PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF HOW RARE IT IS HOW HARD MY MOM SEARCHED FOR IT AND IT BEING OF THE LAST PRESENTS MY MOM GOT ME BEFORE THAT EVIL BASTARD NAMED LIPOBLASTOMA MULTIFORM TERMINAL BRAIN TUMOR DECIDED TO COME OUT AND PLAY

NOW I JUST NEED TO FIND SOMEONE THAT CAN READ SHEET MUSIC AND PLAY THE SONGS
PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN GOOD ANSWERS IN THIS THREAD BUT I WANT TO ADD ONE THING THE BOOK THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN IS THE NOVELISATION OF THE SILMARILLION CHAPTER OF TARIN TURAMBAR SO THAT CHAPTER CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN WHAT YOU COULD DO IS READ THE SILMARILLION AND STOP RIGHT BEFORE THAT CHAPTER THEN READ THE NOVEL AND THEN FINISH THE REST OF THE SILMARILLION

THE SILMARILLION ALSO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR LOAR BUT YOU HAVE ALREADY READ THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT THE APPENDICES OF LOAR IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY BEFORE STARTING THE SILMARILLION

AND AS OTHERS HAVE SAID YOU MIGHT NOT GET EVERYTHING ON A FIRST READ OF THE SILMARILLION IT IS MORE OF A HISTORY BOOK AND IT IS NOT THAT LONG BUT EXTREMELY THE MAIN EVENTS OF LOAR COVER JUST A FEW YEARS WHILE THE MAIN EVENTS OF THE SIL COVER CENTURIES AND THE WHOLE THING COVERS MILLENNIA
LOOK UP CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN HE COMPILED AND PUBLISHED MUCH OF HIS FATHER'S NOTES IN BOOK FORM
BUT TZOLKIN DIDN'T MIND SYMBOLISM IN THE SLIGHTEST HE THOUGHT THAT SYMBOLISM CERTAINLY EXISTS IN GOOD BOOKS BUT THAT IT IS THE RESPONSIBLITY OF THE READER TO PICK IT OUT AND ASSIGN IT'S MEANING VALUE WHAT HE HATED WAS SINGLE PURPOSE AUTHOR DRIVEN ALLEGORY THINGS LIKE ANIMAL FARM WHERE THE AUTHOR WRITES THE STORY WITH ONE MEANING AND ONE MEANING ONLY IN MIND AND THEN FORCES THE READER TO VIEW THE WORK THROUGH THAT ONE SPECIFIC LENSE

OF COURSE TZOLKIN WAS FULLY AWARE THAT HIS LIFE EXPERIENCES AND DEEPLY HELD BELIEFS WOULD HAVE A STRONG IMPACT ON HIS WRITING THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE DEATH OF HIS FRIENDS IN WOULD AFFECT THE WAY HE PERCEIVED AND AS A RESULT WROTE ABOUT CONCEPTS LIKE DEATH THERE IS ALSO NO DOUBT IN HIS MIND OR ANYONE THAT HIS DEEP RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS WOULD AFFECT THE WAY HE PORTRAYED HIS HIGHER POWERS BUT THAT BEING SAID HE ARDENTLY REFUSED TO WRITE A STORY THAT WAS A POINT BY POINT COMPARISON OF SOMETHING ELSE OF COURSE THE CARNAGE OF THE WAR OF THE WRATH TO SOME EXTENT MIRRORS THE CARNAGE OF WORLD WAR BUT NO DIRECT COMPARISON CAN BE MADE

THE RESURRECTION A POWERFUL IMAGE IN CATHOLIC LITERATURE EVENTUALLY BECAME A POWERFUL IMAGE IN WRITINGS BUT IN THIS CASE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HIM AND LEWIS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WHILE TZOLKIN WROTE CHARACTERS THAT WERE UNAVOIDABLY INFLUENCED BY HIS FAITH THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THEY EXIST FULLY AS THEIR OWN CHARACTER SUPERFICIAL COMPARISONS CAN BE MADE BETWEEN GANDALF AND JESUS BUT IN THE END GANDALF IS NOT JESUS GANDALF IS GANDALF AND THAT IS ALL THIS IS STARKLY CONTRASTED BY NARNIA IN WHICH ASLAN RUELY IS JESUS CHRIST HE IS WRITTEN WITH THE DIRECT INTENTION OF BEING A LITERARY PERSONIFICATION OF JESUS AND ALL OF HIS FACETS

SO THE GUY WHO WROTE TEXT'S HERE IS A LITTLE BIT OFF THE MARK

STILL FUNNY THOUGH THANKS FOR POSTING
AS IS EXPLAINED IN THE OTHER SUB HIS BODY WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED NOT TRAPPED NOT BURIED BUT UTTERLY DESTROYED
WISH WE COULD OF SEEN GANDALF CAST MORE MAGIC AND SHOOT SOME FIREBALLS OR LIGHTNING BOLTS AT SOME ORCS
AWESOME WHERE'D YOU FIND THESE
I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHERE YOU FOUND THESE I HAVE A NEW PLACE TO DECORATE
HE EVEN SINGS A COUPLE SONGS FROM LOAR VERY TALENTED THAT PIPPIN
SWEET STANDS WHERE DID YOU GET THEM
THE OF THE LOAR MOVIES ARE WORTH UPGRADING TO NOT SURE ABOUT THE HOBBIT IF ITS WORTH IT AS THEY ARE MORE RECENT THE LOAR HAVE BEEN IN PART IE IN THE DVD VERSION YOU CAN SEE ON THE WRAITHS IN THE 1ST MOVIE AN BLACK BLOB IN THE FACE WHERE THEY HAVE USED EFFECTS TO REMOVE ACTORS FACE IN VERSION ITS CLEANED UP SO ITS A CONTINUAL BLACK

ALSO IF YOU ARE IN THE EU THE MOVIE RUNS ON THE SAME SPEED AS IN THE CINEMA BUT DVD IS FPS TOO FAST

CINEMA AND ARE PLAYED AT DVD PAL IS DVD NTSC IS

THIS MEANS OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL HOURS OF MOILE YOU LOSE A FEW MINS SECONDS IN IS SECONDS AT SO CALL IT EXTRA SECOND PER SECONDS OR 2 A MINERALOGY 2 MINS AN HOUR OR OVER HOURS MINS

LETS SAY THERE ARE MILLION FRAMES ACROSS THE MOVIES

THAT WOULD BE MINS AT

BUT ONLY MINS AT

THAT'S MIN DIFFERENCE OK A FAIR CHUCK OF THAT IS IN THE CREDITS AT THE END
BET IT TOOK YOU TO BUY ALL OF IT

YEAH WHO ARE THEY KIDDING FOR THE SET WE ALL ALREADY HAVE ALL THE MOVIES HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY THE REST OF THE CONTENT IS WORTH THAT MUCH OBVIOUSLY I STILL WANT IT BUT SERIOUSLY OH YEAH NICE COLLECTION
LOVE THE DWARVES AND THE ARGONAUT
SEE THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I'M BAFFLED BY THIS THING I IMAGINE THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS THE HARDCORE FANS FOLKS LIKE YOU WHO ARE BOTH WILLING AND ABLE TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY TO ACQUIRE ALL OF THE MOVIES AND OTHER ITEMS BUT THE CONTENT DOESN'T MATCH UP BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE HARDCORE FANS WOULD ALREADY HAVE ALL THE MOVIES AND LIKE SOMEONE ELSE POINTED OUT IT WOULDN'T COST ANYWHERE NEAR TO UPGRADE EVERYTHING TO SO WHO IS THE TARGET HERE IS ANYONE PLANNING TO BUY THIS THING I HAVEN'T RUN ACROSS ANYONE YET WHO IS

BUT ANYWAY NICE COLLECTION I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN I'M ACTUALLY SETTLED DOWN ENOUGH TO PUT THAT KIND OF EFFORT INTO NICELY DISPLAYING MY COLLECTION TOO
SOURCE

COLOR VERSION
I LOVE THE ARTWORK I JUST WISH IT DIDN'T HAVE THE TITLE OF THE BOOK OR MOVIE WRITTEN LIKE THAT
JUST ORDERED MYSELF A PRINTING THIS IS THE 3RD TIME I'VE GOTTEN LORD OF THE RINGS PRINTS FROM BOTTLENECK
IT WOULD BE COOL TO HAVE ALL THREE HOPEFULLY THEY COME OUT WITH THE OTHER TWO SOON
THE THUMBNAIL LOOKED LIKE AN ULTRASOUND OF A BABY AT FIRST GLANCE
GOOD CHOICE TODAY ACTUALLY IS THE ANNIVERSARY OF DEATH SO YOU'D BETTER GET STARTED
YOU WON'T REGRET READING THEM KEEP IN MIND THAT THE FIRST BOOK STARTS SLOWLY BUT IT DEVELOPS INTO THE BEST STORY EVER TOLD SO BE PATIENT

ALSO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND STARTING WITH THE HOBBIT IT'S A WEEKEND READ
I GOT FOR TWO TOWERS AND ROK FROM GOODWILL FOR A COMBINED THE OTHER DAY ALREADY OWNED THEM BUT I COULDN'T PASS THAT UP
OH IT IS ON
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OF WHEN FRODO SAILED THERE BUT TED NAISMITH HAS A FEW OF THE UNDYING LANDS IN HIS ILLUSTRATED COPY OF THE SILMARILLION IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY
THE SECRET FIRE IS WITH GOD GANDALF HIS SAYING HE'S A SERVANT OF GOD AND ACOR IS THE SUN HE'S CONTRASTING THESE THINGS TO THE FLAME OF AUDUN OR FLAME OF HELL
SO AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THE SECRET FIRE IS THE HEART OF THE CREATION WHICH AA ONLY WITH ILLUVATAR HIMSELF BY THAT GANDALF WANTS TO POINT OUT HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE GOOD TO ERU IN CONTRAST TO THE BARONG WHO WAS CORRUPTED BY MELIOR WHO FIRST RESIDED IN THE FORTRESS OF UTUMNO ALSO BALED UNDEN ACOR IS THE ELDEN WORD FOR THE SUN SO WHEN GANDALF SAYS HE IS THE WIELDER OF THE FLAME OF ACOR HE MIGHT BE REOFFERING TO HIS RING ANARYA ONE OF THE ELDEN RINGS WHICH WAS THE RING OF FIRE THOUGH IT IS UNLIKELY HE WAS REOFFERING TO IT AS THE LOCATION OF THE RINGS WAS A HIGHLY GUARDED SECRET OR HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN REOFFERING TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS A SERVANT OF THE WEST WHERE THE TWO TREES ONCE EXISTED AND FROM WHICH THEIR LAST FRUITS MORE PRECISELY THE SUN AND MOON WERE CREATED THIS PHRASE IS RATHER AMBIGUOUS AND HARD TO EXPLAIN HOPE I HELPED
THE FULL QUOTE BEING

I AM A SERVANT OF THE SECRET FIRE WIELDER OF THE FLAME OF ACOR YOU CANNOT PASS THE DARK FIRE WILL NOT AVAIL YOU FLAME OF UNDEN GO BACK TO THE SHADOW YOU CANNOT PASSIVE
GANDALF ALSO WEARS AN ELF RING CIRC ANARYA WHICH IS THE RING OF FIRE EDIT
2 TYPES OF PROOFS TO SUPPORT MY THEORY

ONE IS I DON'T REMEMBER THE LORE AND THE OTHER IS THIRD PARTY ADDITIONS

THERE IS EXCEPTIONALLY LITTLE IN THE PUBLISHED WORKS ABOUT THE WITCH KING

THERE ARE NO WIZARDS EXCEPT FOR THE FIVE BEAR IN MIND THAT THEY WERE ON MIDDLE EARTH FOR A FEW CENTURIES SO THE WIZARD LORE THAT FOLLOWS THEM WAS MOST PROBABLY STARTED BY THEMSELVES INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE'S ANCESTORS
I THINK YOU'RE STUCK WITH AN EXTERNAL DEFINITION OF WIZARD AND MAGIC LIKELY GAINED FROM PLAYING DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS NOT TO HATE ON IT I LOVE THE GAME MYSELF YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A WIZARD TO CREATE MAGIC THINGS IN MIDDLE EARTH SOME BEINGS ARE INHERENTLY MAGICAL LIKE DWARVES AND ELVES AND ARE ABLE TO CRAFT THINGS USING SPECIFIC TALENTS AND TECHNIQUES THAT IMPART MAGIC ON THEM OR BY USING SPECIFIC MATERIALS TO CREATE MAGICAL EFFECTS

THAT IS WILDLY DIFFERENT FROM BEING A WIZARD AS DEFINED BY TZOLKIN HIMSELF IN HIS WRITINGS

PEOPLE KNEW THAT THE INSTAR EXISTED AND WERE WIZARDS THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THE INSTAR WERE ACTUALLY MAIA SPECIFICALLY
THIS IS STUPID AND YOURE JUST ARGUING YOURSELF IN CIRCLES

THE WORD WIZARD IS NEVER USED TO DESCRIBE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE INSTAR IF YOU CAN REFUTE THIS CLAIM WITH EVIDENCE OF YOUR OWN THEN PLEASE DO BUT IF YOU CANT THEN YOU REALLY SHOULD START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUVE POSTED HERE THE LAST HOURS
ALL WIZARDS ARE MAGIC USERS BUT NOT ALL MAGIC USERS ARE WIZARDS THERE ARE ONLY WIZARDS IN MIDDLE-EARTH THE INSTAR YOU SEEM TO BE CONFUSING THE MIDDLE EARTH TERM WIZARD FOR THE D D TERM NO OTHER RACES CAN BE WIZARDS JUST THE INSTAR THERE ARE OTHER MAGIC USERS BUT THEY ARE NOT WIZARDS SOME ARE SORCERERS FOR EXAMPLE THE WITCH KING WAS KNOWN TO BE ONE
THIS THEORY HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY REFUTED SO MANY TIMES

IS THERE ANY CHANCE WE COULD GET AN FAQ OR SOMETHING IN THE SIDEBAR WITH ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS LIKE THIS
I'LL JUST ANSWER YOU QUESTION EVEN THOUGH ITS SO COMMON

THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY THEY COULDN'T DO THAT

THE EAGLES ARE SENTIENT AND VERY PROUD BEINGS THAT AREN'T AT BECK AND CALL SURE HE CAN ASK FAVORS OF THEM BUT THERE'S NO SILLY SPELL THAT THE MOVIE MAKES IT LOOK LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN GWAIHIR RESCUES GANDALF FROM ORTHANT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT EARLIER GANDALF HAD ASKED RADAGAST TO INVESTIGATE THE RETURN OF THE RING AND SEND INFORMATION TO SAURURAN IN ORTHAL HE SENT GWAIHIR RADAGAST HAS SOMEWHAT MORE INFLUENCE WITH THE EAGLES BEING ASSOCIATED WITH NATURE TO SEND A MESSAGE AND GWAIHIR FOUND GANDALF ON ORTHANT AND RESCUED HIM

2 THEY WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT TO MOUNT DOOM ANYWAY SARON ISN'T AN IDIOT AND HE HAD DEFENSES AROUND MORDOR BOWMEN AND THE FLYING MOUNTS OF THE NAGUAL WOULD HAVE STOPPED AN INVASION

THE WHOLE POINT OF THE JOURNEY WAS STEALTH SECRECY AND EAGLES ARE NEITHER STEALTHY NOR SECRET TWO HOBBITS SNEAKING INTO MORDOR LOOKS LIKE A FEW SPIES NOT AN ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THE RING IF THEY FLEW IN ON MAJESTIC GIANT EAGLES WITH THE MOST POWERFUL WIZARD IN MIDDLE-EARTH ACCOMPANYING THEM SARON JUST MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN SUSPICIOUS ENOUGH TO GUARD MOUNT DOOM DURING THE BOOKS THE BIG GAMBIT IS THAT SARON DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD DESTROY THE RING BUT INSTEAD CHALLENGE HIM WITH ITS POWER

NOBODY COULD HAVE DROPPED THE RING INTO THE FIRE IN THE ORIGINAL STORY THE QUEST ONLY SUCCEEDS BECAUSE OF SMEAGOL BUT WITHOUT THAT FRODO COULD NOT DROP THE RING INTO THE FIRE AND NOBODY IS GOING TO MURDER HIM TO COMPLETE THE QUEST

THE EAGLES ARE PROUD AS FUCK AND WOULD PROBABLY GET CORRUPTED BY THE RING PRETTY QUICKLY MAYBE THEY WOULDN'T LITERALLY EAT FRODO BUT THEY MIGHT JUST TURN AROUND AND TRY TO TAKE IT FOR THEMSELVES

WHAT A DUMB STORY THAT WOULD BE LOAR WOULD SUCK IF THEY JUST WON THREE CHAPTERS IN
WATCH V
LOVE IT WHAT'D THE PROJECT RUN YOU IN TOTAL INCLUDING THE POSTERS
IT'S VERY ODD TO SEE HAND DRAWN CONCEPT ART THAT'S BASED ON THE MOVIES RATHER THAN THE BOOKS

THAT BEING SAID THESE LOOK VERY COOL
WHERE DID YOU GET THE PRINTS
INCREDIBLE ASPECT RATIO THERE THEY LOOK SO GOOD FRAMED
DAMN THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL
WIELDING THE RINGS REQUIRES INTELLIGENCE I ALWAYS GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THE WATCHER WAS BASICALLY A MONSTER ANIMAL THEREFORE IT COULDN'T WIELD THE RING ANY MORE THAN A RABBIT COULD
IS BORN HEARTHSTONE DEGENERATES INTO CANCER DECKS S
AT SOME POINT THE RING WOULD SURFACE AND FIND ITS WAY TO SARON MIGHT TAKE CENTURIES BUT IT WOULD GET BACK TO HIM DURING THE COUNCIL OF ELROD IT WAS SUGGESTED THEY THROW THE RING IN THE SEA BUT GANDALF SAYS THAT IN THE END IT WOULD MAKE IT BACK TO SARON

I DOUBT THE WATCHER HAD THE ABILITY TO MAKE USE OF THE RING THE RING WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ENDED UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POND AND EVENTUALLY BE FOUNDATION
NICE OUT OF CURIOSITY WHY DID YOU CHOOSE FANWE
SICK DUDE GOOD ON YOU FOR GETTING SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE WHITE TREE OF CONDOR LOOKS AWESOME TOO GOOD LUCK TRYING TO ANSWER THE WHAT'S THAT TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW NOTHING OF TZOLKIN
YOU SHOULD NEVER WATCH THE THEATRICAL CUT OF ROK
IT HAPPENS DIRECTLY AFTER GANDALF BREAKS STAFFORDSHIRE

AT THAT MOMENT A HEAVY SHINING THING CAME HURTLING DOWN FROM ABOVE IT GLANCED OFF THE IRON RAIL EVEN AS SAURURAN LEFT IT AND PASSING CLOSE TO GANDALF S HEAD IT SMOTE THE STAIR ON WHICH HE STOOD THE RAIL RANG AND SNAPPED THE STAIR CRACKED AND SPLINTERED IN GLITTERING SPARKS BUT THE BALL WAS UNHARMED IT ROLLED ON DOWN THE STEPS A GLOBE OF CRYSTAL DARK BUT GLOWING WITH A HEART OF FIRE AS IT BOUNDED AWAY TOWARDS A POOL PIPPIN RAN AFTER IT AND PICKED IT UP
WORM-TONGUED THROWS IT OUT OF THE TOWER I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT REASON WHY HE DID IT BUT SAURURAN WAS VERY UPSET WHEN HE FOUND OUT
IT IS THROWN OUT OF AN UPPER WINDOW WHILE SAURURAN IS TALKING WITH GANDALF AND CO GANDALF SUGGESTS THAT GRIMA MIGHT HAVE BEEN AIMING AT SAURURAN OR PERHAPS COULDN'T MAKE UP HIS MIND ON WHO HE WANTED TO THROW IT AT IT ENDS UP IN THE WATER WHERE PIPPIN GRABS IT
FOR WHATEVER REASON I DON'T THINK THE EXTENDED EDITIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR FOR AND TNT BUT EXTENDED IS THE DEFINITIVE VERSION OF ROK FOR ME SOME VERY IMPORTANT SCENES WERE LEFT OUT INCLUDING THIS ONE
MY BOOK IS FUCKED UP BACK COVER IS LOOKING LIKE NEARLY HEADLESS NECK AND THE SPINE IS KIND OF CRIPPLED BUT I LIKE MY COVER BETTER I BELIEVE IT'S SARON ON IT LET ME FIND A LINK
GOOD LUCK I READ THIS A COUPLE MONTHS AGO HAVE YOU READ THE SILMARILLION AND LOAR ALL THE WAY THROUGH RECENTLY IF NOT IT WILL MAKE IT A BIT HARDER TO PUT THINGS TOGETHER AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE
I REALLY REALLY LIKE PERSPECTIVE ON THE QUEST TO ERECTOR LIKE FOAH
GREAT BOOK WITH LOT OF DEEPER INFORMATIONS ABOUT EVENTS FROM LOAR AND SILMARILLION MUST HAVE FOR TZOLKIN FAN
MANN MELIOR IS RIPPED I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT PEOPLE JUST LEARN TO DRAW ONLY ONE BODY TYPE
ITS NOT EVEN FAIR

THE HOBBIT FILMS HAVE ENTIRE SECTIONS THAT WERE COMPLETELY MADE UP JUST TO MAKE THREE MOVIES

OF THE THREE ORIGINAL FILMS THE TWO TOWERS IS MY FAVORITE
THIS REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY THE QUESTION THOUGH IF YOU MEAN WHICH ONE DID HE DO THE BEST JOB OF ADAPTING FROM PAGE TO SCREEN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE FELLOWSHIP SINCE IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT IS EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE TO THE BOOK IN TERMS OF CONTENTION

IF YOU MEAN WHICH ADAPTATION OF IS THE BEST MOVIE I THINK MOST INCLUDING MYSELF WOULD PROBABLY SAY RETURN OF THE KING SINCE IT IS GENERALLY THE MOST BELOVED OF THE THREE FILMS
HANDS DOWN THE BATTLE OF FIVE AHAHAHA SORRY I CAN'T SAY IT
IT'S HARD TO CHOOSE I NEVER WATCH ANY OF THEM ON THEIR OWN BUT RETURN OF THE KING HAS THE RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM WHICH IS MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE SCENE EVER SO THAT ONE
HOW CAN PEOPLE POSSIBLY VOTE FOR BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES
BEST ADAPTATION FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING
BEST FILM ALSO FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING
I WAS THINKING IN TERMS OF ADAPTATION FROM BOOK FOR WINS BUT IF I WERE TO CHOOSE BASED ON MY FAVORITE THING I'D SAY TT BECAUSE OF THE LAST MARCH OF THE ANTS AND THE BADASS HORNS THE TT WAS ALWAYS MY FAVORITE BOOK BECAUSE OF THE ANTS
FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING IS PROBABLY THE BEST OF THE SIX MOVIES BUT RETURN OF THE KING IS MY FAVORITE OUT OF ALL OF THEM
THIS MAY BE UNPOPULAR OPINION BUT I REALLY LIKED THE FIRST HOBBIT MOVIE IT FELT LIKE A HOBBIT FILM INSTEAD OF REDOING LOAR BUT OUT OF THE TWO TOWERS IS MY FAVORITE
THE HOBBIT SAYS LITERALLY NO ONE OUTSIDE A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY
BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES IS THE WORST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN
FELLOWSHIP
I WOULD SAY THAT FELLOWSHIP IS THE BEST MOVIE BUT MY FAVORITE IS DEFINITELY THE TWO TOWERS THE BATTLE OF DEEP IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE BATTLE
KINDA SURPRISED TO SEE MY PICK LEADING THE POOL
BOOMIER WAS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER SO I HAD TO PICK IT
FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING STAYED TRUE TO BOOK MOSTLY
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST I LOVE ALL OF THEM EXCEPT FUCK NUMBER BAD P BAD

ALL JOKES ASIDE THE MOST IMPACTING TO ME EMOTIONALLY WAS PROBABLY TT AND I STILL ADORE ROK IF YOU JUST PRETEND THE BOOKS NEVER EXISTED AND LOOK AT FILMS PURELY AT THE QUALITY I HAVE TO SAY TT ROK IS STILL AMAZING THOUGH

JUST THOUGHT I'D PUT IN MY TWO CENTS
ITS NOT UP FOR DEBATE EACH FILM IS WORSE THEN THE LAST FELLOWSHIP IS BEST THERE ARE NO ARGUMENTS TO BE BAD AGAINST THIS SCIENTIFIC FACT
THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY WAS FAR MORE FAITHFUL AN ADAPTATION IN ALL RESPECTS THAN THE HOBBIT MY THEORY IS THAT THE CHANGE FROM NEW LINE TO WARNER BROTHERS CAUSED THERE TO BE A CHANGE IN EMPHASIS LORD OF THE RINGS WAS CLEARLY A FILM TRILOGY MADE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD READ THE BOOKS THE HOBBIT WAS CLEARLY MADE TO JUST BE POPULAR WITH NO REGARD WHATSOEVER TO THE PREFERENCES OF THOSE WHO HAD ACTUALLY READ THE BOOK UNNECESSARY FIGHT SCENES AND ACTION WERE ADDED TO MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE TO THE GENERAL MOVIE GOERS IT WAS EXPANDED TO THREE FILMS PURELY FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING EXTRA CASH OUT OF IT THERE'S STORY LINES IN THE HOBBIT FILMS I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE WEIRD SEXUAL TENSION BETWEEN ARIEL AND FILI OR WAS IT AILI WAS JUST OFF THE CHARTS WRONG FOR ME THE WHOLE THING WAS A MESS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SOMEONE WHO LOVES EVERYTHING TZOLKIN EVER WROTE I HAD TO SEPARATE THAT PART FROM MYSELF TO EVEN COME CLOSE TO REMOTELY ENJOYING THE HOBBIT
THE ORCS BREED THEMSELVES

THEY ONLY HAD TO BE CREATED ONCE AND THEN THEY MULTIPLIED ESSENTIALLY LIKE ANY OTHER RACE
HERE'S THE EDUCATIONAL VIDEO WHICH MORGOTH HAD AND SARON EXCAVATED FROM THE RUINS OF SINGBAND

NSF

WATCH V
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT ORCS ARE JUST TAINTED TWISTED ELVES THAT MORGOTH CAPTURED SO WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE FIRST ELVES ORCS WERE PASSED DOWN THROUGH BREEDING
HI I'M A MODDER FOR THE BEME SERIES AND I HELPED TEST OUT ONLINE WHICH BRINGS BACK THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ONLINE PLAY IF YOU LIKE CNC CHECK OUT CNC ONLINE YOU MUST FORGIVE MY PRESENCE ON THIS REDDIN I LOVE LOAR BUT BEME IS WHY I AM HERE

I CAN CONFIRM THAT BEME I II AND ROTOW RUN PERFECTLY ON MY WINDOWS LAPTOP THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS TO FOLLOW MOSTLY THAT THE GAME MUST BE PLAYED WITH A VIRTUAL DISK AND THAT YOU MUST EDIT THE GAME OPTIONS MANUALLY FOR YOUR WIDE-SCREEN RESOLUTION

BECAUSE OF LEGAL REASONS NOBODY CAN LINK YOU THE GAME DOWNLOAD HOWEVER ENSURE THAT YOU GET THE FULL ORIGINAL GAME PACKED VERSIONS CAUSE UNSOLVABLE ISSUES I SHOULD KNOW I HELP OUT WITH A FACEBOOK PAGE THAT PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE GAME AND ONLINE GAME
ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY FRODO WOKE UP IN RIVENDELL
TO THIS DAY I STILL HOPE AGAINST HOPE IT'LL SHOW UP ON STEAM SOME MORNING LOVED THE WALL COMBAT SOO MUCH MISSED IT TERRIBLY IN BEME 2 AND HARDLY PLAYED IT BECAUSE OF THAT
I STILL PLAY THESE GAMES ON MY WINDOWS
JUST SEARCH FOR LORD OF THE RINGS BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH PATCH IN GOOGLE AND YOU ARE READY TO GO

NUMBER

CHRISTOPHER IS DEAD SET AGAINST IT
HOW

AND I'M NOT TALKING COPYRIGHTS OR ANYTHING I MEAN SERIOUSLY HOW

THE SILMARILLION IS SO ENORMOUS THAT IT TAKES UP A LITERALLY UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME BUT NO LESS THAN WHAT YEARS OR SO AND WHO CARES IF I'M OFF BY A FEW THOUSAND HOW WOULD YOU EVER MAKE A FILM THAT COVERS THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF HISTORY AND MYTHOLOGY
HAHA REMINDED ME OF THIS
PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ADAPTATION IN THE FORM OF A TV SERIES THAT'S AS FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE YES IT WOULD TAKE LONG AND BE A HUGE PROJECT BUT IT CAN BE DONE I'VE HEARD THAT A STUDIO HAS ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS TO THE WHEEL OF TIME AND IS GOING TO MAKE THAT INTO A TV SERIES WHICH IS ALSO GOING TO BE AN ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE PROJECT
AFTER WHAT THEY DID TO THE HOBBIT I HOPE NOT
I DOUBT IT WILL HAPPEN IN MY LIFETIME BUT I'D LOVE TO SEE A MOVIE FOR THE CHILDREN OF HARBIN
NO PLEASE NO I WILL NOT LET THEM TOUCH SILMARILLION
IF THEY EVER DID IT IT WOULD BE JUST A TINY PART OF THE BOOK ONE STORY TWO MAX
I HOPE IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN ON THE OTHER HAND I AM SOMEWHAT OPEN TO NEW ADAPTATIONS OF LOAR
IT CAN'T BE A MOVIE SURE IT'S A SHORT BOOK BUT ONE VAGUE PARAGRAPH CAN COVER A MILLION THINGS HAPPENING

I COULD SEE IT WORKING AS A LONG FIRM TV SERIES MAYBE

AND BE AS EXPENSIVE AS ALL HELL

AN OLD POST OF MINE

NO THANKS THE SILMARILLION MAY HAVE A LONG AND DETAILED PLOT WITH A CHARACTER LIST OF DOZENS BUT THE AMOUNT OF DIALOGUE CHARACTER INTERACTION AND FLESH ON THE BONES OF THE MAIN PLOT IS QUITE ADAPTING IT INTO A TV SERIES WOULD REQUIRE A HUGE AMOUNT OF CHANGES AND INVENTIONS BY THE WRITERS AND THE TONE OF THE DEPRESSING AND PACKED WITH RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD ATTRACT CASUAL AUDIENCES IT'S NOT A HUGELY POPULAR BOOK LIKE LOAR OR THE HOBBIT THERE ARE VERY FEW RETURNING CHARACTERS TO CONNECT IT TO THE PREVIOUS FILMS AND THE SELF SERVING IMMORTAL ELVES WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE A POPULAR POINT OF VIEW FOR CASUAL VIEWERS IT WOULDN'T BE LIKELY TO BE GRANTED THE BUDGET THAT COULD DO THINGS JUSTICE I MASCULINE O

IN ANYCASE ASSUMING THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS ACCURATE IT'S VERY UNLIKELY TO BE ADAPTED ANYTIME SOON

ACCORDING TO THIS ARTICLE THE COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS OF CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN AND THE ESTATE WERE MORE COMPLICATED THAN MERE ISSUES WITH THE LOAR SCRIPTS WORTH NOTING THE RIGHTS TO LOAR AND TH WERE SOLD DECADES BEFORE BY TZOLKIN HIMSELF BEFORE THE ESTATE EVEN EXISTED SO THEY HAD NO LEGAL SAY OR INPUT INTO THE FILMS WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW DIFFERENT THEY ARE TO THE BOOKS IT WOULD SEEM A LITTLE ODD TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT OR ENDORSE THEM I MASCULINE CAN YOU CLAIM TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT A BOOKS LITERARY HERITAGE WHEN PUBLICLY SUPPORTING A FILM YOU HAVE NO INVOLVEMENT WITH THAT TAKES DRAMATIC LIBERTIES WITH THE SOURCE MATERIAL

BOOKS

CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN IS OF THE SILMARILLION UNDER COPYRIGHT LAW NOT SURE ABOUT THE OTHER BOOKS WHICH HE EDITED

CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN HOLDS THE AUTHORIAL COPYRIGHT ON THE SILMARILLION NOT J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN HARPER COLLINS HAS CONFIRMED WITH US THAT UNDER CURRENT COPYRIGHT LAWS THE COPYRIGHT WILL THEREFORE NOT EXPIRE UNTIL YEARS AFTER CHRISTOPHER S DEATH AND NOT IN WHEN THE COPYRIGHT ON THE WORKS OF J ROYAL ROYAL TZOLKIN WILL EXPIRE UPDATED

WHICH MIGHT MEAN HE'D BE ABLE TO PUT IN A CLAUSE IN HIS WILL ASKING THAT THE RIGHTS TO THE SILMARILLION ETC ARE KEPT IN A TRUST DEED AND NOT SOLD UNTIL HIS COPYRIGHT PASSES INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN OR HE COULD ENTRUST THEM TO ANOTHER COMPANY I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON COPYRIGHT LAW BUT EITHER WAY I THINK IT WILL BE A VERY LONG TIME BEFORE WE SEE ANY OF THE OTHER BOOKS BE ADAPTED INTO BLOCKBUSTERS FOR BOTH LEGAL AND MONETARY REASONS

AND LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM HE IS AN FORMER ANGLO SAXON SCHOLAR AND LECTURER AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY CHRISTOPHER WAS ALSO GIVEN COMPLETE CREATIVE CONTROL BY HIS FATHER IN HIS WILL TO

PUBLISH EDIT ALTER REWRITE OR COMPLETE ANY WORK OF MINE
WHICH MAY BE UNPUBLISHED AT MY DEATH OR TO DESTROY THE WHOLE
OR ANY PART OR PARTS OF ANY SUCH UNPUBLISHED WORKS AS HE
IN HIS ABSOLUTE DISCRETION MAY THINK FIT AND SUBJECT THERETO

HE ALSO WISELY URGES THE EXECUTORS TO KEEP HIS COPYRIGHTS IN THE FAMILY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE



SO I MASCULINE O HE'S SIMPLY PROTECTING HIS FATHER'S LITERARY INTERESTS IN THE WAY HE DEEMS MOST APPROPRIATE IF YOU LOOK AT TZOLKIN SENIOR'S COMMENTS REGARDING MOOTED ADAPTIONS AND DRAMA AS ART FORM AT LARGE I THINK IT'S FAIRLY LIKELY HIS VIEWPOINTS ARE IN LINE WITH HIS FATHERS

ALSO THIS OLD POST ON A TZOLKIN FORUM IS ENLIGHTENING GIVING AN APPARENT INSIGHT INTO HIS VIEWS ON THE FILMS



CT AND THE TZOLKIN ESTATE FAMILY GET NOTHING WHATSOEVER FROM VIDEO GAMES SOUNDTRACKS MERCHANDISE COLLECTIBLES ACTION FIGURES BOBBLEHEADS BURGER KING CUPS ETC ETC ETC THE ONLY RIGHTS TZOLKIN PERE RETAINED WAS TO THE BOOKS THEMSELVES AND A CERTAIN ROYALTY PAYMENT ON THE FILMS GROSS PROFITS WHICH APPARENTLY DOESN'T COUNT MERCHANDISING YES BOOK SALES HAVE INCREASED

TO THE MAIN POINT I AM IN AN AWKWARD POSITION HERE BECAUSE CT HAS SHARED WITH ME HIS OPINIONS OF PJ'S WORK NOT TH OF COURSE HIS CRITICISM IS PAGES AND PAGES LONG AND NOT COMPLIMENTARY AT ALL UNFORTUNATELY I SIMPLY CANNOT SHARE ANY OF THIS MATERIAL PUBLICLY ALL I CAN SAY IN VERY BROAD TERMS IS THAT CT FEELS THAT ALL THE THEMES THAT TO HIM MAKE THE LR IMPORTANT ARE COMPLETELY SUBMERGED IN THE MOVIE BEHIND FRENETIC MOTION CHASES FIGHTS AND SHRIEKING CHOIRS AND IN ONE MAJOR CASE POOR CASTING BUT HE ALSO HAS SOME VERY COGENT THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE ALTERATION OF CHARACTERS AND THE POOR RENDERING OF PARTICULAR SCENES STEMMING FROM PJ'S APPARENTLY POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BOOK I FIND COMMENTS A BIT AMUSING BECAUSE CT ACTUALLY DOES KNOW RATHER A LOT ABOUT CINEMA AND HIS SUGGESTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENTS ON WHAT P DID YES THAT'S A SEEMING OXYMORON AND THE REASON UNDERLYING THE LAWSUIT

I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT MATTERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ARRANGED TO FORESTALL THAT

IN ANY EVENT NO STUDIO WOULD EVER EVER EVER GIVE AN AUTHOR FINAL CUT AND MEAN IT LOOK AT THE WAY DISNEY SWINDLED P L TRAVERS ON A SIMILAR CONTRACT PROVISION OVER MARY POPPINS IT WOULD BE HONOURED AS SINCERELY AS PROFIT PERCENTAGE I EAST NOT AT ALL CT IN THIS IS NOT BEING SHORTSIGHTED HE'S BEING A REALIST

BESIDES I THINK YOU FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE POSITION TAKEN BY CT THAT NO ADEQUATE FILM ADAPTATION OF THE LR MUCH LESS THE SILMARILLION COULD BE MADE AND THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF BATTLES AND MONSTERS VS TECHNOLOGY IT SIMPLY DOESN'T TRANSLATE ITS ESSENCE TO FILM WELL AT ALL OR AT LEAST NOT A FILM WHICH COULD REMOTELY HOPE FOR SUFFICIENT BOX-OFFICE TO COVER ITS COSTS AND HOLLYWOOD VERY MUCH CARES ABOUT CASH OVER ARTICLE NO STUDIO IS EVER GOING TO MAKE A TZOLKIN MOVIE AS A LABOUR OF LOVE

ALL YOU'RE REALLY ARGUING NEAR AS I CAN TELL IS THAT CT SHOULD JUST SURRENDER TO THE COMMERCIAL PIMPING AND SELL OUT LIKE AUDREY SEUSS ON THE GROUNDS HE AND THE FAMILY CAN'T RESIST FOREVER WELL MAYBE THAT WILL IN FUTURE DECADES PROVE TO BE THE CASE BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN ONE SHOULDN'T NONETHELESS FIGHT THE LONG DEFEAT

AND THAT POINT IS EXPLICITLY OPINION

CHRISTOPHER DOESN'T CARE WHETHER BOOK SALES INCREASE HE REALLY DOESN'T HE WOULD RATHER ACCEPT THE SILMARILLION GOING OUT OF PRINT THAN SEE IT KEPT AFLOAT ON THE BACK OF MOVIES LIKE PJ'S YES HE SAID SO

IT IS WORTH NOTING THE TZOLKIN ESTATE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN AN ONGOING LAWSUIT WITH WARNER BROTHERS WHO PREVIOUSLY TRIED TO GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING THE ESTATE ANYTHING AT ALL FOR THE LOAR FILMS SO THEY ARE VERY UNLIKELY TO WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH THAT PARTICULAR STUDIO AGAIN



BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY ARE COMPLETELY AGAINST IS A STAGE SHOW OF LEAF BY NIGGLE TOURING AT THE MOMENT

SHOWS

AND CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN WAS INVOLVED WITH THE RADIO ADAPTATION HE SPECIALLY GRANTED RIGHTS TO USE MATERIAL FROM LAST SONG AND UNFINISHED TALES



T

I CAME ACROSS THIS IN A ADJ REVIEW IT BEST SUMS UP MY THOUGHTS

I THINK ADAPTING ANY PORTION OF THE SILMARILLION WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE COMPLICATED AND CONTROVERSIAL THAN ADAPTING THE HOBBIT WAS THE BIBLICAL TONE OF MUCH OF THE WORK IS LIKELY UNTRANSLATABLE TO FILM AS IS THE SENSE OF NARRATIVE REMOVE AND THE VAST SWATHS OF TIME INVOLVED I THINK AN ADAPTATION OF THE SILMARILLION THAT IS TRUE TO THE SUPERLATIVE CREATIVE CORE OF THAT SPECIFIC TEXT WHILE ALSO IN KEEPING WITH TZOLKIN S BROADER VISION OF MIDDLE EARTH WOULD PROBABLY LOOK SOMETHING LIKE TERRENCE MALICK S THE TREE OF LIFE IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULD REQUIRE EXPERIMENTAL SHOOTING AND NARRATIVE TECHNIQUES AND WOULD BE PANNED BY MOST OF THOSE INCLINED TO ENJOY HOLLYWOOD S PRESENT TAKE ON THE EPIC SO MUCH OF WHAT SEEMS DRY AND FACTUAL ON THE PAGE WOULD NEED TO BE PRESENTED AS ETHEREAL AND IMPRESSIONISTIC ON THE SILVER SCREEN AND I DON T THINK TZOLKIN FANS WOULD HAVE THE PATIENCE FOR IT

TO THE EXTENT THE STORIES OF THE SILMARILLION ARE IN SITU A MYTHOLOGICAL HAZE THAT HANGS INVISIBLY OVER MIDDLE EARTH REIFIED IN SONG AND STATUE YES BUT NEVER TOUCHED IN THEIR ESSENCE EXCEPT IN THE WAKING AND SLEEPING VISIONS OF INDIVIDUAL DWARVES ELVES GOBLINS ORCS WIZARDS AND MEN YOU WOULDN T WANT TO FALSELY CRYSTALLIZE THEM INTO WHAT COULD EASILY LOOK LIKE A MIDDLE EARTH DOCUMENTARY SHALL WE TELL THE STORY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE WORLD AS THOUGH IT WERE THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR FIELDS REIMAGINE ALIENOR USING A SIMPLY MORE SUMPTUOUS VERSION OF THE EXISTING RIVENDELL SET CAN WE SPEAK OF THE BEINGS IN THE SILMARILLION LET ALONE PORTRAY THEM IN FILM AS JUST GRANDER VERSIONS OF THE HEROES OF THE FELLOWSHIP NO IF YOU RE GOING TO CAST A FILM ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH GODS GODLIKE CREATURES AND LEGENDARY PERSONAE YOU HAVE TO EMPLOY A VISUAL STYLE THAT ESTABLISHES THESE ENTITIES AND THE EVENTS THEY PRODUCE AND MOVE THROUGH AS BEING SOMEHOW BEYOND OUR IMMEDIATE UNDERSTANDING JACKSON WOULD LIKELY NOT BE THE APPROPRIATE DIRECTOR FOR SUCH A WORK AS TOO MANY EXPECTATIONS INCONGRUOUS WITH SUCH AN ADAPTATION ALREADY ATTACH EVEN NOW TO HIS PROJECTS WE WOULD NEED INSTEAD A DIRECTOR AND A SCREENWRITER WITH WHOM OUR EXPECTATIONS WOULD RUN MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT WE D CALL AN ART HOUSE FILM

SO I GUESS I D SAY THAT FAILING THOSE PREREQUISITES BEING MET I DON T THINK I D WANT TO SEE THE SILMARILLION ADAPTED AT ALL AND SO I CAN T PREDICT WHICH STORIES FROM THE BOOK I D MOST WANT TO SEE ADAPTED AS THE STYLE OF ADAPTATION I D CONSIDER MOST APPROPRIATE WOULD CONSTITUTE AN ARTISTIC VISION WELL BEYOND AT LEAST IN CINEMATIC TERMS MY PRESENT UNDERSTANDING OR MY ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE



EVENTUALLY SOMEONE WILL DO IT COPYRIGHT ONLY SEEMS TO LAST FOREVER THESE DAYS
AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN I THINK IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE IDEA THERE WOULD BE NO POSSIBLE WAY TO MAKE IT INTO A MOVIE THINK ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE THE BIBLE INTO A MOVIE S YOU COULD MAKE MOVIES AND STILL NOT BE THROUGH HALF OF THE MATERIAL YES YOU CAN CUT SOME STUFF AND DO ALL THAT BUT IS IS REALLY WORTH IT I THINK OUT OF ALL OF WORK THE SILMARILLION SHOULD BE LEFT ALONE IT WOULD BE FOR THE GOOD
NOPE NEVER TZOLKIN ESTATE IS DEAD AGAINST IT AND I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IT WOULD MAKE A GOOD MOVIE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THE BIBLE WOULD MAKE A GOOD MOVIE SURE INDIVIDUAL SMALL PARTS WOULD MAKE GOOD MOVIES BUT TRYING TO MAKE A COHESIVE ADAPTATION OF THE WHOLE THING EVEN BREAKING IT INTO MANY CONSECUTIVE PARTS WOULD BE FOOLISH
HONESTLY I HOPE NOT THE LOAR MOVIES WERE GREAT BUT THE HOBBIT WAS MPH AND TO MAKE THE SILMARILLION IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HOURS ON HOURS OF FOOTAGE
EH THE BOOK IS BETTER
I THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE A MOVIE OF ONE OF THE STORIES BUT THE ENTIRE FILM WOULD BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FILM

THE TALE OF BEDEN AND LUTHIER WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BEST CHOICE FOR AN ADAPTATION IT'S MORE EASILY VISUALIZED HAS CHARACTERS YOU CAN TIE IN FOR THE MOVIE FANS ARWEN AND GRANDPARENTS SARON OF COURSE BROTHER FIBROID FELAGUND AND HAS A CONCISE DEFINED PLOWLINE WITH LOTS OF ACTION AS WELL AS OBVIOUS FANTASY ELEMENTS WEREWOLVES VAMPIRES A TALKING DOG AND FOR A TZOLKIN STORY IT ACTUALLY HAS A DECENTLY SIZED FEMALE CAST LUTHIER MELIAN THURINGWETHIL SO THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO ADD EXTRA LOVE INTEREST BULLSHIT

HOWEVER IT'S ALL A MOOT POINT BECAUSE A CHRISTOPHER TZOLKIN WON'T ALLOW IT B PETER JACKSON DOESN'T WANT TO DIRECT IT AND C THE ONLY REMOTELY ACCEPTABLE CANDIDATE FOR THE ROLE OF LUTHIER AUDREY HEPBURN IS DEAD
ITT EVERYONE SAYS NO BUT ME

I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE TIME TO MAKE SILMARILLION MOVIES TO RIDE ALL THE LORD OF THE RINGS HOBBIT LOVE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE I MEAN P COULD STOP AFTER OR IF PEOPLE FEEL OVERSATURATED BUT AT THIS POINT I GOTTA SAY THAT I'D SEE ANY MIDDLE EARTH UNIVERSE MOVIE MADE BY HIM UNLESS THEY SOMEHOW GOT REALLY BAD LIKE JAR JAR BIN BAD


EVERY TIME I SEE THIS TOPIC BROUGHT UP I GET SO EXCITED AND DEPRESSED AT THE SAME TIME
GOD I HOPE NOT
IT'D BE A PRETTY TERRIBLE MOVIE YEARS CAN PASS DURING A PARAGRAPH IN THAT BOOK

GENERALLY WHEN YOU DO AN ADAPTATION OF A WORK FOR CINEMA YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO CONDENSE THE TIME FRAME SO IT'S EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THE ART FORM FALLS SHORT WHEN IT COMES TO LONG-TERM THINGS LIKE THE SILMARILLION EVEN TV SERIES HAVE THE PROBLEM
THERE MAY BE MOVIES FROM STORIES IN THE SILMARILLION LIKE SARON RUINING NOUMENON OR TALE OR BEDEN LUTHIER OR A LONG SERIES ABOUT THE NOLUDAR BUT IT'S TOO MUCH TO IMAGINE PUTTING IN ONE MOVIE
IT WOULD BE A LOT OF INFORMATION AND VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF THEATRICAL ENTERTAINMENT SO I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE A MOVIE SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TARNISHED IF IT HAD TO BECOME THEATRICAL WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY IT WOULD SELL TO THE MASSES
I HOPE NOT SINCE IT WOULD BE ANYTHING LIKE THE HOBBIT MOILES IT WOULD BE DISGRACEFUL
I HEARD SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO GET THE RIGHTS TO DO A MOVIE AND A TV SERIES WEATHER THAT IS CONFIRMED OR NOT I DON'T KNOW
I REALLY HOPE NOT
I THINK YOU COULD LIKE PRETEND THAT THE MUSIC IS CREATING THINGS EVEN IF IT ISN'T SO AMAZING IN REALITY TO ACTUALLY CREATE THINGS YOU KNOW MOVIE MAGIC PEOPLE WILL GET THE POINT
I SURE HOPE NOT I DON'T WANT ANY MOVIE TRIOLOGY OR SERIES SINCE THE LAST ONE IS ALWAYS SPLIT IN 2 TO COVER THE WHOLE BOOK

JUST PICK OUT ON STORY AND TELL IT AND LEAVE THE REST TO OTHER PEOPLE
NOT A CHANCE ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH POPPA DOCUMENT
THERE COULD BE A HUNDRED DIFFERENT FULL MOVIES FROM THE STORIES IN IT BUT ONE MOVIE OR MOVIES WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COME CLOSE TO DOING IT JUSTICE
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY EXACTLY CHRISTOPHER DOESN'T LIKE THE LOAR AND THE HOBBIT SERIES WHICH IS WHY WE THERE WON'T BE OTHER MOVIES MADE
IT SIMPLY CANNOT BE DONE AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LENGTH OR ANYTHING I REFER TO ONE SPECIFIC THING

THE MUSIC OF THE AINU NO MORTAL MAN COULD COMPOSE SOMETHING SO GLORIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL AND ETERNAL AND PERFECT AND ABSOLUTE AS THE MUSIC THAT TZOLKIN DESCRIBED YOU WOULD NEED MOZART BEETHOVEN AND WAGNER TO WORK TOGETHER ON IT THEN HAVE CHOPIN STRAUSS AND HAYDN REVISE IT WHILE UNDER SUPERVISION THEN PASS IT TO VERDI TCHAIKOVSKY AND ROSSINI TO REFINE AND EXTEND THE WORK AND LASTLY HAVE PAGANINI AND TARTINI DIRECT THE LARGEST ORCHESTRA EVER WITH ONLY THE BEST MUSICIANS ACROSS THE WORLD IN IT

AND EVEN THEN YOU WOULD STILL NOT EVEN BE CLOSE TO THE MUSIC THAT SHAPED THE WORLD
I BOUGHT THE COMPLETE EDITION OF THE GAME FOR ABOUT AND HAD A BLAST WITH IT IT IS FAN FICTION LORE MUCH LIKE THE FILMS IT'S BATMAN ASSASSIN'S CREED SET LOOSELY IN THE FILM VERSION OF LOAR STILL A FUN GAME THOUGH AT LEAST FOR ME
VERY SOLID GAMEPLAY THE LORE IS FANFICTION PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF LICENSING ISSUES BUT PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE CANON IF YOU'RE PLAYING AS A CHARACTER THAT WASN'T IN THE STORY THEN WHY WOULD YOU SUGGEST WHAT YOU'RE DOING SHOULD FOLLOW THE STORY
MY FAVORITE PART OF THE GAME IS HOW THEY EXECUTED THE ORCS GOBLINS AND URUK AS WELL AS THE CULTURE INSIDE MORDOR I SAY IT WAS DONE REALLY WELL ESPECIALLY WITH THE WHOLE POWER STRUCTURE FEARS AND SO ON VOICE ACTING WAS GREAT OVERALL I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY FUN COMPARED TO THE OTHER LOAR GAMES PRODUCED
BUT WHY DOES THIS PHOTO LOOK SO OLD THOSE MOVIES WERE ONLY

DAMN
THAT STILL ONLY COUNTS AS ONCE
YOU DON'T LOOK THAT YOUNG MOST CHILDREN DON'T WEAR SCARVES
ASW IT'S RUDY
BRAZ
HAS SEAN MET LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THIS FANS THIS IS LIKE THE 10TH POST I'VE SEEN ON HERE SEEMS LIKE A REAL COOL GUY
WHAT YEAR WAS THIS TAKEN
MY GOD HE'S TINY
IS SEAN WEARING SHOES ON HIS KNEES TO LOOK LIKE A HOBBIT
YOU LOOK SLIGHTLY LIKE A CARDBOARD CUT OUT OF YOURSELF IT MUST BE THE ANGLE OR SOMETHING
THEY WOULD BE SMALL ONLY CHILDREN TO YOUR EYES

THAT FACE AWESOME BEING A TALL PERSON AROUND A HOBBIT IS THE BEST I'M NOT QUITE AS TALL AS YOU BUT AS GIRL IT WAS STILL AMUSING TO POSE WITH DOM HE ASKED IF WE COULD FORM A BASKETBALL TEAM
BILLY BOYD ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE THE COOLEST OF THE CAST I'D WAGER THAT HE WAS THE ONE WHO MADE EVERYONE LAUGH WHEN THEY WERE DRIVING FLYING TO A SCENE LOCATION
WOW YOU'RE REALLY TALL NO WONDER YOU'RE LEGENDARY JAMIE
WHOA HE'S FUCKING MIDDLE AGED NOW

E HOLY SHIT HE'S WHAT IS HAPPENING
TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE AND NO OFFENCE BUT ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS THIS GUY
I HAD THE BIGGEST CRUSH ON HIM BACK IN THE DAY
NEW PHOTOS OF THE LIVE ACTION ATTACK ON TITAN MOVIE
I MET HIM LAST YEAR TOO HE LOVED MY MIDDLE EARTH MAP LEGGINGS AND MY SEPTUM PIERCING ALSO WE TOOK A PICTURE TOGETHER AND HE MADE FUN OF MY BECAUSE MY PHONE WAS ON SELFIE MODE
I DON'T THINK I'D BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE HIM WITH THAT BEARD
FOOL OF A TOOK
YOU'RE LIKE AN ADORABLE GIANT MY LITTLE BROTHER IS AND THE SAME HEIGHT I'M NOT A HOBBIT BUT STANDING NEXT TO GUYS AS TALL AS YOU MAKES ME FEEL LIKE ONE
YOU LOOK LIKE SOMEONE PHOTOSHOPPED JUSTIN HEAD ONTO AN ADULT MALE'S BODY
YOUR HAND IS BIG ENOUGH TO CONSUME THE ENTIRETY OF BILLY HEAD

IT COMES IN FISTS I'M DUETTING ONE
PIPPIN HAS A GREY BEARD NOW

I FEEL OLD
JUSTIN BIEBER I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SO TALL
YOU LOOK A REALLY TALL JEFF SEID
THIS LAD SEEMS VERY HAPPY BY THE OTHER HAND THE HOBBIT DOES NOT
VINCENT AULTMAN
ANYTHING TO DO WITH LOOKS OTHER THAN WHAT IS EXPLICITLY STATED BY TZOLKIN WAS NOT PART OF ORIGINAL VISION THE APPEARANCE OF HORN IN THE MOVIES BEING SIMILAR TO A REAL LIFE HORN MAY BE COINCIDENCE BUT IT'S ALSO JUST AS LIKELY TO BE AN INSPIRATION

AS FOR ANDÚRIL AND DURANDAL BEING SIMILARLY NAMED IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT TZOLKIN DREW UPON ANY NUMBER OF MYTHICAL BLADES WHEN CREATING THE STORY BEHIND ANY OF THE BLADES IN HIS STORIES BUT THE NAMES ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY CONSTRUCTED USING HIS LANGUAGES THAT IS WHY LOAR EXISTS AT ALL AS A VEHICLE FOR HIS LANGUAGES

THE ONLY EXPLICIT REFERENCE IS AVALLÓNË A SEA PORT ON THE SHORES OF TOL ERESSËA
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ABOUT POPULAR SKYRIN MOD ENDORAL IS IT MORE OF A CONSPIRACY BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO REARRANGE ANYTHING OR LESS BECAUSE THE PHONEMES DIFFER A WEE BIT MORE
YEA HE WAS
ARE YOU TALL OR IS IT BECAUSE HE IS A HOBBIT IN REAL LIFE TOO
YOU MAY HAVE BETTER LUCK IN R TENGWAR
IT'S HARD TO MAKE OUT WHAT SOME OF THE FIRST LETTERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

IT'S EITHER B FOLLOWED BY A WEIRD SHORT CARRIER OR IT'S PR WHERE THE R IS BOTH RUN UP AGAINST THE P AND WIDER THAN IT WOULD NORMALLY BE

THE CIRCLE WITH THE VOWEL OVER IT IS GENERALLY THE AU OR AW DIPHTHONG EITHER EXPLICITLY AS THAT DIPHTHONG OR IN SOME MODES THE CIRCLE IS JUST A W ANYWAY AND THIS CASE WORKS OUT THE SAME SOME FULL MODES TREAT IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY BUT SINCE WE HAVE MEHTA VOWELS OTHERWISE I'LL IGNORE THAT OPTION

SO THEN THE OTHER OPTION IS WHETHER TO HAVE VOWELS GO OVER THE PRECEDING OR FOLLOWING CONSONANT THE PLACEMENT OF A SHORT CARRIER IN ONE READING WOULD IMPLY OVER THE FOLLOWING CONSONANT BUT IF THAT'S AN R WE CAN'T REALLY TELL

FINALLY WHAT LANGUAGE IS IT SINCE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE MODES ASSIGN DIFFERENT VALUES I'M GOING TO GIVE MOST OF THESE AS THE SINDARIN ENGLISH VALUES TO START

IT'S ALSO HARD TO SEE IF THERE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SPACES MY EXAMPLES BELOW ARE WITHOUT SPACES BUT IF I HAD TO GUESS WHERE THEY OCCUR I'D PUT SPACES BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE S IN EACH CASE

SO OPTIONS

BOETSAUNG OR BOETSAWNG

PORETSAUNG OR PORETSAWNG

PROTESAUNG OR PROTESAWNG

QUENDA VALUES PROTESAUNW OR PROTESAWNW THIS ONE IS WONKY AS DUE TO THE O IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT LETTER FOR THE R

SO NOTHING THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE TO ME I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THESE COULD POSSIBLY BE WORDS IN AN ELVISH LANGUAGE BUT AT A GUESS I'D SAY NUMBER IT'S POSSIBLE GIVEN THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE SPACING WOULD LEAVE THE S BY ITSELF THAT IT COULD BE A NAME BUT NEITHER THE FIRST OR LAST NAME WOULD BE ONES THAT I'D RECOGNIZE AS SUCH IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IF THIS PERSON HAD SOMETHING WRITTEN THAT ORIGINATED IN A NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE THAT IT'S USING A MODE VALUES THAT I AM UNFAMILIAR WITH AND SO MY OPTIONS ABOVE WOULDN'T COVER THEM OR IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS PERSON SIMPLY MADE MISTAKES AND IT'S NOT REPRESENTING WHAT THEY WANTED IT TO SAY
THE LEGS RUIN IT A BIT

THIS IS WHAT I IMAGINE LEGS LOOK LIKE
I DON'T
DO YOU REFER TO YOUR FRIEND AS COUNTY B I LENT A FRIEND THE SAME EDITION OF THE HOBBIT HE IS ALSO HAIRY AND RECENTLY AT A BEACH
AHHAHAHAHA THAT WAS MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THE ACTUAL MOVIE
FOR SOME CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND THE LOAR MUSICAL WAS IN DEVELOPMENT AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MOVIES SO THEY HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON EACH OTHER WHICH MAKES FOR A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE APART FROM THE MOVIES

I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS EVER FILMED IN IT'S ENTIRETY A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS BEEN IN THEATER ALL HIS LIFE TOLD ME ABOUT IT AND SHOWED ME THE MUSIC

THIS SONG IS PREFORMED AS THE HOBBITS ARE LEAVING THE SHIRE YOU CAN HEAR THE PART WHEN THEY COME ACROSS THE ELVES THEY ARE SINGING ABOUT THEIR LEAVING AND THE MUSIC CHANGES IT'S REALLY COOL IMO

ANOTHER OF MY FAVORITES IS THE GRAY HAVENS SONG
WATCH V

I LOVE HOW THEY BRING THE ROAD GOES ON THEME BACK TO IMPLY FRODO IS GOING ON ANOTHER ADVENTURE HITS ME RIGHT IN THE FEELS
WATCHING THE FILMS AND LOOKING AT ARTWORK IS PROBABLY YOUR BEST OPTION
I WILL BE HONEST I HAD NO IDEA THIS EVEN EXISTED I HAVE TO FIND THIS IT LOOKS AWESOME YOU HAVE QUITE AN AWESOME MISSUS
I REMEMBER GOING INTO A WATERSTONES WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AFTER I'D FINISHED THE SILMARILLION TO BE TOLD IT HAD GONE OUT OF PRINT SOMETHING LIKE YEARS PRIOR YOU ARE A VERY LUCKY PERSON ON MULTIPLE LEVELS
THIS MUST BE THE STORY THAT CONFIRMS TOM BOBADIL IS THE WITCH KING
I FOUND A COPY JUST LIKE THAT AT THE LOCAL LIBRARY IT'S A FUN SILLY BOOK THAT IS OVER TOO SOON I READ IT TO MY KIDS BUT THEY WEREN'T AS INTERESTED AS I WAS THEY HAVEN'T LEARNED TO LIKE POETRY YET
I HAVE THE SAME COPY YOU CAN FIND THEM OCCASIONALLY ON EBAY
I HAVE HEARD OF THIS BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THESE WERE STORIES WERE NOT REALLY CONNECTED TO LOAR THIS IS MORE OF A PROTOTYPE OF THE CHARACTER
IF I EVER HAVE KIDS THIS IS WHAT I WILL READ TO THEM AT NIGHT
MY DAD HAD THIS BUT I CAN'T FIND IT NOW
MY DAD HAS THIS IN HIS BOOKSHELF IT'S GREAT AND I AM SUPER JEALOUS
SWEET I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD WOMAN THERE
VERY COOL
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A NIGHTMARE I LOVE LOAR BUT CAN'T STAND TB
TURNED IT INTO A NEW BIRDBATH NEXT TO THE WHITE TREE
SINCE WERE TALKING ABOUT GROND DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MORGOTHS
I DON'T THINK WE EVER HEAR ABOUT IT AGAIN BUT I DOUBT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO RE-USE THE STUFF FROM MORDOR IT IS A BIT THE SAME WITH THAT FELL BEAST THEY BURNED THE CORPSE AND NO GRASS WOULD GROW THERE WHILE ON THE MOUND OF LOYAL SHADOWFAX FLOWERS GREW
THE BOOKS MOSTLY LEAVE THAT OUT BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW THE LOGISTICS OF REUSING ALL THAT STEEL WOULD WORK THE RAM WAS BEWITCHED WITH SPELLS OF RUIN WHICH I FEEL MIGHT COMPLICATE OR COMPROMISE THE STEEL CONTAINED WITHIN
GANDALF SPEAKS THE WORDS IN BLACK SPEECH IN BOOK II CHAPTER 2 THE COUNCIL OF ELROD

ASH NAG DURBATULÛK ASH NAG GIMBATUL
ASH NAG THRAKATULÛK AGH KRIMPATUL

TRANSLATED THE WORDS MEAN

ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL ONE RING TO FIND THEM
ONE RING TO BRING THEM ALL AND IN THE DARKNESS BIND THEM
FACE PALM THAT IS THE ONE RING WITH THE EYE OF SARON IN THE CENTER SURROUNDED BY THE THREE RINGS THAT WERE MADE FOR THE ELDEN KINGS


LOVE THE ARTWORK

I'VE COLLECTED MTG CARDS JUST FOR THE ART STARTED SOME YEARS AGO BUT I HAVE CLOSE TO ZERO INTEREST IN ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME ALTHOUGH I'VE PLAYED THE VERSION FOR COUNTLESS HOURS I'VE COLLECTED PARTLY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE ART DESIGNS REMINDS ME OF MIDDLE EARTH AND LOAR NOW THAT I'VE DISCOVERED THE LOAR CARDS IT MAKES LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT ART DESIGN MUCH EASIER AND BROADENS THE VARIETY OF MY ART COLLECTION
IT'S AN EXCELLENT CARD GAME WITH GREAT COOPERATIVE ASPECTS FUN DECKBUILDING POSSIBILITIES AND GORGEOUS ARTWORK THE MECHANICS ARE POSITIVELY OOZING WITH THEME THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY
THE CG IS A GREAT GAME IT REMAINS VERY WELL SUPPORTED BY FANTASY FLIGHT AND LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE FOR SOME TIME NOT ONLY ARE THE MECHANICS ENGAGING AND THEMATIC THE GAME HAS A SOLITAIRE OPTION WHICH IS ALWAYS NICE
I PRESUME THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE TRADING CARD GAME MADE BY DECIPHER
IF SO ANY COMMENTS OPINIONS ON THE TCG VS CG
I COLLECTED AND PLAYED THE TCG FOR YEARS BUT DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CG
IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND THERE LIVED A HOBBIT NOT A NASTY DIRTY WET HOLE FILLED WITH THE ENDS OF WORMS AND AN OOZY SMELL NOR YET A DRY BARE SANDY HOLE WITH NOTHING IN IT TO SIT DOWN ON OR TO EAT IT WAS A AND THAT MEANS COMFORT
DELETED
R LOTRLCG
JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW
GREAT CARD GAME MY FAVORITE BOARD GAME IS ACTUALLY MIDDLE-EARTH QUEST NEXT TO THE WAR OF THE RING AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE THEME
I GOT A CHANCE TO MEET HIM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE PHOTO BOOTH AT A CON LAST YEAR SUPER COOL GUY AND REALLY TAKES TIME TO TALK TO HIS FANS EVEN REMEMBERED SOME HE HAD MET BEFORE GREAT GUY GREAT EXPERIENCE
AMSTERDAM COMIC CON
RUUUDY RUUUDY RUUUDY RUUUDY RUUUDY
AND WHO'S THE GUY ON THE RIGHT

















WHERE DID YOU GET THAT THAT'S A COOL SHIRT
YOU PAID HIM MONEY TO MEET WITH YOU DON'T GET IT TWISTED
MOVIE ISILDUR DID THAT
EXCEPT HE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT SARON WAS ALREADY BEATEN BY THE TIME ISILDUR CUT THE RING FROM HIM ELENDIL AND HAD DEFEATED SARON AND DIED THEMSELVES IN THE PROCESS ISILDUR JUST CAME UP AFTERWARDS AND TOOK THE RING FROM HIS VANQUISHED FOE

THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT ACT ISN'T IN ANY WAY THAT IT DEFEATED SARON BUT IN THAT IT PREVENTED HIM FROM BEING ABLE TO SPIRIT AWAY THE RING RECREATE HIS BODY AND RISE TO POWER AGAIN IN ANY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
ELENDIL CITED SARON BECAUSE SARON BURNED ALL HIS COOLDOWNS HOWEVER SINCE SARON WAS ALREADY DEAD ISILDUR JUST LOOTED HIM HAD HE DESTROYED THE LOOT THE ONE HE'D HAVE SAVED THE WORLD FROM SARON BUT THE ONE IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DESTROY VOLUNTARILY
LET YOUR NERD FLAG FLY AND DON'T LET ANYONE CHANGE THAT
THIS IS AWESOME WHERE COULD I FIND THIS
I BOUGHT IT FROM IN AUSTRALIA YEAR AGO IT WAS ADVERTISED AS A TAPESTRY RUG NOT THAT I HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT MATTERS IS I HAVE THIS AWESOME PIECE OF MEMORABILIA THAT I LOVE AND WANTED TO SHOW OFF TO YOU GUYS THAT'S ALL
TAPESTRY IS A FUN WORD
HOME IS BEHIND THE WORLD AHEAD
IS ANYBODY GOING TO TELL OP THAT'S A THROW BLANKET
VERY NICE I'D JUST WISH IT COVERED THE ENTIRE WORLD INCLUDING MORDOR AND MINAS TIGRISH
IT'S MAGNIFICENT
DECORATING DONE RIGHT
I SLEPT IN THAT SAME BLANKET LAST NIGHT
NEAT HOW BIG IS IT
ENJOY YOUR NEW PLACE AND BEST OF LUCK ADJUSTING TO LIVING ON YOUR OWN OR WITH NEW PEOPLE LOVE THE TAPESTRY
I HAVE THAT EXACT ONE IN MY ROOM
THAT'S THE WITCH KING BUT COOL FIRE PIT NONETHELESS
FOUND THIS GEM AT THE UTAH RENAISSANCE FAIRE AND THOUGHT YOU GUYS MIGHT LIKE IT CREDIT TO NIGHTMARE PRODUCTIONS AND DESIGNS FOR THE CREATION
THAT SCREAMS AMERICA
NICE COLLECTION COULD YOU LIST ANY OF THE UNUSUAL ONES YOU HAVE I ALWAYS LIKE TO CHECK OTHER PEOPLE'S TZOLKIN COLLECTIONS TO SEE WHAT BOOKS I AM MISSING
MY UNWIN PAPERBACK BOXED SET DOESN'T HAVE THE HOBBIT IN IT JEALOUS
AW I'M WORKING ON MINE BUT IT'S SO SAD IN COMPARISON BEAUTIFUL WORK ON THE COLLECTION

WHAT WAS YOUR METHOD OF ACQUIRING ALL OF THEM I'LL HAVE TO POST MY WIP COLLECTION HERE SOON BUT I COLLECTION SOLELY THROUGH HALF PRICE BOOKS
DO I SEE FIRST EDITIONS
I HAVE THE SAME COPY OF THE SILMARILLION THAT YOU HAVE ON THE BOTTOM SHELF FOURTH FROM THE RIGHT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT BUT I LOVE HOW IT LOOKS
THIS IS A LOT OF BOOKS BUT THERE'S LIKE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME BOOKS THERE'S LIKE VISIBLE BOOKS BUT ONLY UNIQUE BOOKS THAT WE CAN SEE PRETTY COOL NONETHELESS
NOT TO MENTION THE HEIGHT OF MORIA
IT'S AN INTERESTING TIME AND I WISH THERE WAS MORE WRITTEN ON IT I LIKE THE STORY OF NOUMENON THE GREAT CIVILIZATION SLOWLY CORRUPTED BY AN OUTSIDE FORCE EXCEPT FOR A FEW BRAVE INDIVIDUALS KIND OF REMINDS ME OF THE STORY OF EARTH AND CAPTAIN SHERIDAN ON BABYLON NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT

I HAVEN'T READ THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH AND THESE DAYS IT SEEMS KIND OF EXPENSIVE TO GET A HOLD OF BUT IS THERE ANYTHING IN THOSE VOLUMES ABOUT THE SECOND AGE
THERE ARE SOME PAGES ABOUT THE SECOND AGE IN UNFINISHED TALES I RECENTLY BOUGHT IT NOT YET READ IT BUT ON THIS WIKIPEDIA PAGE YOU CAN SEE THE CONTENTS

WIKI

A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE BOOK CONSISTS OF NOTES AND ANNOTATIONS BY C TZOLKIN

THE BOOK IS FAIRLY CHEAP THOUGH I GOT A PAPERBACK VERSION FOR EUROS INCLUDING INDICES AND MAPS MY VERSION IS PAGES

ALSO FOR U DROGIN
I WISH THE PERIOD WAS A BIT MORE REPRESENTED TOO EVEN APART FROM THE LAST ALLIANCE THERE WAS SOME AWESOME STUFF THERE THE COLONIZATION OF MIDDLE-EARTH BY THE NUMENOREANS THE FORMATION OF THE ELVISH KINGDOMS AFTER DESTRUCTION
FAN MOVIE BORN OF HOPE ABOUT THE DUNEDIN AND THE BIRTH OF ARAGON

JY
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY UNLESS YOU COUNT FAN FICTION PERHAPS

THE ONLY BOOK I CAN THINK OF IS LOAR ITSELF THERE IS THE BACKGROUND STORY OF THE RANGERS OF THE NORTH DÚNEDAIN IN GENERAL IN THE FORM OF AKALLABÊTH WHICH IS A CHAPTER IN THE SILMARILLION AND OF COURSE THE APPENDICES OF LOAR THE APPENDICES HAVE STORY AND BACKGROUND
I WOULDN'T SAY THERE'S TONS OF VERSIONS THERE'S TONS OF DIFFERENT COPIES WITH COOL COVERS AND COLLECTORS ART AND STUFF BUT OF THEM WILL ALL HAVE THE EXACT SAME CONTENTION THERE ARE ONLY 2 INSTANCES IN WHICH VERSIONS OF THE BOOKS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY THAT I AM AWARE OF

THE FIRST VERSION OF THE HOBBIT THAT CAME OUT IN WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE THAT EVERYONE TODAY IS FAMILIAR WITH IN TZOLKIN WENT BACK AND REVISED IT TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH THE LORD OF THE RINGS FINDING AN ORIGINAL COPY IS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE SO PRETTY MUCH ANY COPY THAT YOU FIND WILL BE THE MORE REVISED MODERN EDITION

THAT BEING SAID HARPER COLLINS IS RELEASING A FACSIMILE FIRST EDITION ON THE OF SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR SO IF YOU WANT TO READ THE ORIGINAL YOU COULD GET THAT

AS FOR THE LORD OF THE RINGS I BELIEVE SOME MINOR TEXTUAL CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN EVERY EDITION RELEASED SINCE THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION HOWEVER I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING MAJOR PRETTY MUCH ANY COPY OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS GOING TO BE THE SAME IN TERMS OF CONTENTION
YOU CAN LIKELY FIND A BOXED SET OF THEM ALL TOGETHER FAIRLY CHEAP I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS ANY THAT ARE DIFFERENT PER SE OTHER THAN HAVING NOT HAVING ARTWORK
R LOAR COMMENTS
LOVE THE NOVELS BUT FAIR WARNING LOAR HAS A WHOLE LOT OF DESCRIBING TERRAIN HAVING A AND DETAILED MAP HANDY MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR REFERENCE AND TO PREVENT IT BEING REPETITIVE

ALSO LOOKING UP NAMES IN THE WIKI IS A BIT OF A MUST SINCE THE NOVELS ARE FILLED WITH MUCH MORE LORE THAN THE MOVIES AND MOST OF IT IS BARELY EXPLAINED THE BACKSTORY IS ALL ACTUALLY QUITE INTERESTING TOO
I JUST KEEP WONDERING WHAT THE HELL THE ADDITIONAL HOUR MATERIAL TO THE HOBBIT MIGHT BE THE THEATRETICAL CUT ITSELF WAS FULL OF MEANINGLESS SCREENTIME THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CUT AWAY WITHOUT ANY EFFECT TO THE STORY
FORDOES CONTRACT


AND THE RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH REPLICA THATS WHAT L WANT DO YOU KNOW OF ANY PLACE THAT SELLS A REPLICA WITH NOTHING WRITTEN ON IT
YEAH GET THE EXTENDED EDITIONS INSTEAD I RECENTLY PURCHASED BOTH FOR AROUND SINCE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING NEW THE EXTRAS ARE INCREDIBLY LACKLUSTER JUST SAVE YOURSELF SOME MONEY

THE CONCEPT OF MAGIC IN THE LOAR UNIVERSE IS DIFFERENT TO WHAT WE'RE USED TO TODAY THIS IS BECAUSE TZOLKIN BELIEVED IN POWER OR ABILITY WHICH COMES FROM YOUR INNER NATURE THIS IS SO PREVALENT THAT TZOLKIN EVEN SPELLED MAGIC IN IT'S ARCHAIC FORM MAGIC MAGI WHERE IT'S MEANING HELD TRUE TO THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE SOMETHING HAD AN ABILITY OR PROPERTY WHICH WAS PONDEROUS AND UNEXPLAINED TO THE BEST OF THE BEHOLDERS KNOWLEDGE THEREBY APPEARING MAGICAL IN NATURE

IMAGINE SOMEONE WHO COULD COUNT AND MANIPULATE NUMBERS OR ANOTHER WHO COULD DO FLIPS AND MOVE THEIR BODY IN A WAY THAT SEEMED COMPLETELY UNNATURAL THIS WAS MAGIC MAGI

SO UNLIKE HARRY POTTER WHERE YOU CAN CALL UPON SOME SEEMINGLY EXTERNAL FORCE TO DO YOUR BIDDING FOR YOU WITH A SPELL AND LEARNED METHODS MAGIC IN LOAR IS AN EXTENSION OF YOUR VERY BEING YOUR NATURE OR A PROPERTY OF OBJECTS THEIR NATURE IT CANNOT BE LEARNED IN THE WAY WE'RE USED TO ALA HARRY POTTER ETC

TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE IT IN THEIR NATURE NOT MAAR ELVES ETC OR DON'T POSSESS AN OBJECT OF MAGICAL ABILITY PALANTIR ETC OR KNOW ANY TECHNIQUES FOR CREATION OF THESE OBJECTS FORGING RINGS OF POWER PALANTIR ETC THINGS CAN APPEAR TO BE MAGICAL LASTLY GIVEN THE THEME OF HAVING IT IN THEIR NATURE MAGIC IN LOAR IS REALLY WHAT OTHERS CALL THE CHANNEL FOR SUPERNATURAL POWER NATURE OF THESE BEINGS OR OBJECTS TO FLOW THROUGH AND MANIFEST

SOME EXAMPLES

GALADRIEL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHERS MEAN WHEN THEY SAY MAGIC HOW COULD SHE IT'S PART OF HER NATURE SHE'S ALWAYS HAD IT FROM HER POINT OF VIEW WHAT PART ARE THEY REFERRING TO THIS IS WHAT SHE SAYS TO SAM AND FRODO
FOR THIS IS WHAT YOU FOLK CALL MAGIC I BELIEVE THOUGH I DO NOT UNDERSTAND CLEARLY WHAT THEY MEAN AND THEY SEEM TO USE THE SAME WORD OF DECEITS OF THE ENEMY BUT THIS IF YOU WILL IS THE MAGIC OF GALADRIEL

THE BATTLE BETWEEN GANDALF AND SAURURAN ON CARADHRAS THE MOUNTAIN WHERE SAURURAN TRIES TO BRING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ON THE FELLOWSHIP SAURURAN AND GANDALF ARE NOT CHANTING SPELLS AT EACH OTHER BUT RATHER HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH CARADHRAS TO SWAY THE BEINGS ACTION IN LINE WITH THEIR OWN INTENT THINK OF HOW PEOPLE TRY TO PERSUADE OTHERS IN THE REAL WORLD TO DO WHAT THEY WANT SIMILARLY SAURURAN AND GANDALF CAN PERSUADE CARADHRAS TO DO SOMETHING AS THEY ARE MAAR EFFECTIVELY DEMIGODS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THEIR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE SUPERNATURAL AS THEY THEMSELVES ARE SUPERNATURAL TO OTHERS THIS APPEARS MAGICAL WHEN IN REALITY THEY ARE SIMPLY AND LITERALLY TALKING TO OTHER SUPERNATURAL BEINGS

THE DOOR TO MORIA MELLON ISN'T A MAGICAL SPELL IT'S SIMPLY THE KEY FOR THIS PARTICULAR DOOR DUE TO THIS PARTICULAR DOORS DESIGN VERY LITERALLY THIS DOOR WAS CREATED USING THE PROPER TECHNIQUES AND GIVEN A KEY WHICH IS THE PHRASE MELLON EXACTLY LIKE HOW THE DOOR FOR YOUR HOUSE HAS IT'S KEY AND THAT KEY DOESN'T OPEN ANY OTHER DOOR BECAUSE IT WASN'T DESIGNED TO SO IT'S NOT MAGIC THAT THE DOOR OPENED WHEN GANDALF SAID MELLON IT'S MERELY THAT HE KNEW THE PASSWORD THE KEY FOR THIS SPECIFIC DOOR ANYONE SAID IT AND OPENED THAT DOOR JUST AS ANYONE CAN TURN THE KEY IN THE LOCK OF YOUR DOOR AND OPEN IT YET TO SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER SEEN A KEY OR A DOOR IT COULD APPEAR MAGICAL

THE PALANTIR ARE SIMPLY A TECHNOLOGY TO COMMUNICATE OVER DISTANCE THEY WERE CREATED USING A SPECIFIC TECHNIQUE AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE TECHNIQUE IT CAN APPEAR MAGICAL HOW IS IT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH THESE ORBS I'M SURE THE TELEPHONE WAS MAGICAL WHEN IT WAS INVENTED NOW IT'S RUDIMENTARY BECAUSE IT'S IN OUR NATURE WE'VE ALWAYS HAD TELEPHONES SO WHO CARES IT'S NOTHING SPECIAL TO US YET TO SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER SEEN IT IT COULD BE AWESOME INDEED

HOPEFULLY I'VE EXPLAINED WELL ENOUGH THE CONCEPT OF MAGIC IN LOAR FEEL FREE TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS
GALADRIEL IMPLIES IT'S THE SECOND
WE GET A COUPLE OF FIGURES NOTABLY MEN BECOMING SORCERERS SOME OF THE NAGUAL AND THE MOUTH OF SARON BEING NOTABLE EXAMPLES THAT SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S MAGIC
WELL GANDALF IS IN INSTAR DIVINE SO HE ABLE TO MANIPULATE SUCH THINGS
I FINISHED THIS LAST YEAR AND THOUGHT YOU GUYS WOULD ENJOY IT IT TOOK THREE MONTHS AND LOADS OF PATIENCE
OH I FOUND A MAP ONLINE THAT SOMEONE HAD BLOWN UP AND DIVIDED INTO FIVE OR SIX SECTIONS THAT I HAD TO TAPE TOGETHER TO FORM THE WHOLE MAP THEN I USED A LIGHT TABLE TO TRACE IT ONTO FABRIC WHICH TOOK ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THAT IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF FINISHING THE STITCHING I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT AND I'D VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE YOUR BUDDY'S MAP OF HERCULE
QUITE IMPRESSIVE FOR SOMETHING DONE BY HAND THAT'S ONE TREASURE TO KEEP
YOU'RE THINKING OF GLORFINDEL AT THE COUNCIL OF ELROD

BUT IN ANY CASE SAID GLORFINDEL TO SEND THE RING TO HIM WOULD ONLY POSTPONE THE DAY OF EVIL HE IS FAR AWAY WE COULD NOT NOW TAKE IT BACK TO HIM UNGUESSED UNMARKED BY ANY SPY AND EVEN IF WE COULD SOON OR LATE THE LORD OF THE RINGS WOULD LEARN OF ITS HIDING PLACE AND WOULD BEND ALL ITS POWER TOWARDS IT COULD THAT POWER BE DEFIED BY BOBADIL ALONE I THINK NOT I THINK THAT IN THE END IF ALL ELSE IS CONQUERED BOBADIL WILL FALL LAST AS HE WAS FIRST AND THEN NIGHT WILL COME
YOU KNOW WHO HAD A ROUGH WEEK FRODO WHEN HE HAD TO HAUL ASS UP MT DOOM

MAN WHAT THE HECK WAS GOING ON HERE

THIS IS GREAT GONNA BOOKMARK IT FOR DEFINITE FUTURE USE THANKS
PRETTY SURE GLAMOURING GLOWS IN THE BOOK
BECAUSE PETER JACKSON SCREWED UP

HE EVEN HAS GANDALF TELL THORIN THAT ORCRIST AND GLAMOURING ARE ELDEN BLADES AND THEN TELL BILBO THE BLADE IS OF ELDEN MAKE WHICH MEANS IT WILL GLOW BLUE WHEN ORCS OR GOBLINS ARE CLOSE

MAYBE HE DECIDED IT WASN'T AS EFFECTIVE VISUALLY

MY BEST GUESS IS THAT HE CHOSE NOT TO HAVE GLAMOURING GLOW BLUE IN FELLOWSHIP BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER EXPLAINING WHERE THE SWORD HAD COME FROM AND THEN WHEN HE MADE THE HOBBIT MOVIES HE HAD TO LEAVE IT THAT WAY FOR CONTINUITY REASONS

EITHER WAY A SCREW-UP
SHOULDN'T ALL THE ELVES BLADES GLOW BLUE THEN OR IS IT SPECIFICALLY THE ELVES OF GONDOLIER OR MORE BROADLY THE FIRST AGE
I'M SURE THAT JACKSON HAD TO PICK AND CHOOSE HIS NERDY SWORD LORE FOR THE FILMS WHILE MOST TZOLKIN FANS ME INCLUDED I HAVE MY OWN REPLICA COLLECTION STARTED LOVE THE BLADES AND THEIR STORIES THE AVERAGE MOVIE-GOER DOES NOT CARE TO HEAR ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT WEAPONS AND THEIR IMPORTANCE THROUGHOUT THE MOVIES HE GAVE STING IT'S SPOTLIGHT AS WELL AS ANDURIL IT'S OWN TO MAKE THOSE SCENES INVOLVING THEM EXTRA SPECIAL TO NOT TAKE AWAY FROM STING WHICH IS THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE BLADE FROM THE FILMS HE LEFT OUT THE GLOWING DETAIL OF GLAMOURING AND ORCIRST
HOWEVER I DO FEEL THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN JACKSON GIVES THE MORE AVID FANS SOME WINKS WITHIN THE FILMS WHEN GANDALF FIGHTS THE BARONG IN FOR THERE IS AN OBVIOUS WHITE GLOW FROM GLAMOURING NOT JUST FROM HIS WHITE SHIELD THING HE IS WIELDING WHILE THIS EFFECT ISN'T EXACTLY MENTIONED THAT I REMEMBER IT IS A SMALL GEM TO THOSE THAT KNOW THE LORE
AND MY BOW
WHAT IS THIS TERRIBLE VIDEO
HUM THEY GO FROM THE SHIRE TO RIVENDELL ALWAYS AFTER THAT THE FELLOWSHIP GOES TO THE MOUNTAINS ALTHOUGH THEY END UP GOING FARTHER SOUTH WHEREAS BILBO CUT STRAIGHT EAST TO ERECTOR AFTER THE FELLOWSHIP ATTEMPTS AND FAILS CARANDAS THEY GO A BIT FURTHER SOUTH TO MORIA AND THAT'S FAR AWAY FROM PATHOLOGY

CHECK THIS HANDY MAP FOR PATHS
THE SHIRE
THE TROLLSHAWS
FEATHERTOP IN HOBBIT FILMS NOT BOOKS
BREE APPEARS IN DESOLATION OF SMUG NOT IN HOBBIT BOOKS BUT IN UNFINISHED TALES
RIVENDELL
MISTY MOUNTAINS

I THINK THAT'S IT
RIVENDELL CIRC
THE MISTY MOUNTAINS ALTHOUGH BILBO TAKES THE PATH OVER UNDER THE MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTH WHILE THE FELLOWSHIP TRIES TO TAKE A ROUTE MUCH FURTHER SOUTHERN
IF WE'RE BEING PICKY EARENDIL DID NOT FLY VINGILOT TO ALIENOR HE SAILED IT TO ALIENOR IT ONLY FLEW FROM THE WAR OF WRATH ONWARDS
NOT BAD A BIT SHAKY ON THE PRONUNCIATIONS

ALSO I FEEL LIKE HE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE MOST BADASS QUOTE

I HAVE NOT PASSED THROUGH FIRE AND DEATH TO BANDY CROOKED WORDS WITH A BRIDEGROOM TILL THE LIGHTNING FALLS
TIMESTAMPED LINK

CRINGE
FIRST OFF NONE OF THE ELVISH LANGUAGES ARE COMPLETE ENOUGH TO USE ALL THE TIME IN DAY TO DAY LIFE ESPECIALLY WHEN APPLIED TO THE MODERN WORLD WHILE THERE IS A HUGE WEALTH OF VOCABULARY AND GRAMMAR THEY ARE NOT IN A TRUE SENSE COMPLETE

IT'S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING THAT THERE ISN'T JUST ONE LANGUAGE CALLED ELVISH THE TWO ELVISH TONGUES TZOLKIN DEVELOPED ARE QUENDA AND SINDARIN SO YOU WOULD NEED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THESE THIS IS A DECENT SOURCE TO BEGIN LEARNING QUENDA

HNOHF

IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT WRITING SYSTEM'S CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELVES THAT OFTEN GETS MISTAKEN FOR ELVISH THE TENGWAR AND THE AIRTH A SYSTEM OF LETTERS AND A SYSTEM OF RUNES RESPECTIVELY CAN BE USED TO WRITE IN VARIOUS TONGUES IF YOUR GOAL LIES IN WRITTEN LANGUAGE RATHER THAN SPOKEN YOU WILL WANT TO FOCUS ON ONE OF THE ENGLISH MODES FOR THE TENGWAR

SORRY MY ANSWERS AREN'T MORE COMPLETE THIS WAS A RATHER HASTY AND SCATTERBRAINED RESPONSE DONE ON MY PHONE I HOPE IT WAS AT LEAST MODERATELY HELPFUL THOUGH
SEE THIS SITE SINDARIN IS WHAT IS GENERALLY SPOKEN IN MIDDLE-EARTH BY MOST ELVES AND THE DÚNEDAIN THE NOLUDAR SPOKE QUENDA WHEN THEY RETURNED TO MIDDLE-EARTH AND ADOPTED SINDARIN SOME OF THE DÚNEDAIN DID TAKE UP QUENDA AS WELL
GO TO R QUENDA AND R SINDARIN
I GOT THAT SHIRT TOO I ALWAYS LOVE IT WHEN BOOT HAPPENS TO HAVE A LOAR SHIRT
R FIREFLY COMMENTS
ADAPTING HIS RIDE TO STRATEGIC CONTEXT

SINCE HE'S ALSO ON A HORSE EARLIER IN THE BATTLE NOT JUST WHEN MARCHING HE DOESN'T TAKE TO THE AIR UNTIL THE ROHIRRIM ARRIVE IT'S NOT AS CUMBERSOME AS YOU MIGHT BELIEVE
WHERE CAN WE GET ONE PRECIOUS
ME AND MY DAD LOVE LOAR I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A LINK TO THIS TO GET HIM ONE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
LOL CURRENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF MY EARTH AGE WAITING ON A MAP OF THE HENN REGION WRITTEN IN LOAR SCRIPT TO BE SHIPPED GIFT FOR A FRIEND THE AGONY OF WAITING FOR DOPE SHIT
JUST GOT DONE WATCHING DESOLATION OF SMUG AND STILL PUMPED UP TIME TO DO SOME IMPULSE LOAR BUYING
REMINDS ME OF THE CUSTOM MOUSE PADS THAT WERE GOING AROUND A YEAR OR TWO BACK WITH STUFF LIKE THAT YOU JUST ORDER IT FORGET ABOUT IT FOR A MONTH AND THEN GET A SURPRISE DELIVERY IN THE MAIL
NAPS SHALL BE TAKEN
I WOULD HAVE THE BEST DREAMS IF I SLEPT ON THAT PILLOW OH THE JOURNEYS MY MIND WOULD TAKE ME ON
WAKES UP AT AM

OH SHOOT I DROOLED ON DUNELAND AGAIN
WHY DOES IT SAY REALM MIDDLE-EARTH IS NOT REALLY A REALM IS IT IT CONTAINS MANY REALMS BUT IS NOT REALLY ONE ITSELF IT JUST BUGS MY TZOLKIN OCD WHY ADD THAT WHEN ALL THE MAPS SAY MAP AND NOT REALM GRRRRRR
IT'S TOO BEAUTIFUL TO RE-ENACT THE END OF THE RETURN OF THE KING
AMAZING AMAZING WORK
REALLY INCREDIBLE WORK GET SOME DECENT LIGHTING IN THERE TOO SO WE CAN MAKE DESKTOP IMAGES OUT OF THIS BEAUTY

ANY IDEA ROUGHLY HOW MANY BRICKS WERE USED HOW LONG DID IT TAKE IS THIS WHY I'M MISSING ALL MY BLACK PIECES
SORRY FOR THE SUB PAR PHOTO QUALITY
AS SOMEONE WHO LIKES EGOS AND LOAR I FIND THIS AMAZING
THE LIGHTING IN THE FIRST PICTURE MADE ME THINK THAT THE PUPIL WAS FLOATING
THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN'T TELL IF IN R LOAR OR R LEGO
THATS INCREDIBLE GREAT JOB
WELL DONE
AWESOME
THAT IS HUGE AND AWESOME
WAY TOO DAMN COOL

THIS IS PHENOMENAL

SERIOUSLY AWESOME
AMAZING
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO BUILD THIS
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING
THAT IS AMAZING GREAT JOB HOW LONG DID IT TAKE

ALSO THOSE DRAWINGS IN THE BACKGROUND ARE COOL AS WELL
AWESOME DID YOU PLAN IT ALL OUT YOURSELF
THAT'S SO COOL TELL ME HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE HOW MANY BRICKS DID YOU USE
SOMEONE PLEASE TELL US YOU DID A MINAS TIGRISH
DUDE THIS IS LIKE SET WORTHY
YOU NEED TO PUT A LEGLESS LEGO PERGOLAS IN THERE ALONG WITH LEGLESS LEGO PERGOLAS LEGO LASS LEGO LASSO
I'M ALWAYS JEALOUS OF PEOPLE THAT CAN BUILD STUFF ON THEIR OWN I COULD NEVER DEVIATE FROM THE INSTRUCTIONS UNLESS IT WAS BUILDING SHITTY HOUSES OR SOMETHING
YOU GUYS MUST HAVE BEEN SUPER DUPER RICHARD
I NAMED MY CAT ELEVENSES WHEN I WAS YOUNGER ALTHOUGH MY DAD WASN'T AT ALL INVOLVED EXCEPT TO POINT OUT THAT ANY CAT NAMED ELEVENSES WAS GONNA GET IT'S ASS KICKED BY ALL THE OTHER CATS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
BATTLE OF EVERMORE
RAMBLE ON AND BATTLE OF EVERMORE
BLIND GUARDIAN MIRROR MIRROR
BURN THE FLEET BY THRICE
PERHAPS TOO OBVIOUSLY LOAR THEMED BUT I SEE FIRE BY ED SHEERAN IS MY FAVORITE
THE SUMMONING AND BATTLEDORE ARE ALL BASED AROUND TZOLKIN BLIND GUARDIAN FALLS OF AUROUS AND MANY OTHER BANDS HAVE LOAR THEMED SONGS
BLIND OF THE RINGS
PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED ZEPPELIN HERE BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO MENTION IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING A HOBBIT WOULD PLAY OR MAYBE AN ELF
ELWYN AND MERRY KILLED THE

THE REST DIE WHEN THE RING IS DESTROYED
I DON'T THINK PERGOLAS KILLED ONE BUT HE GOT IN A DECENT SHOT FROM HIS BOAT ON THE RIVER ALNUIN WITH THE HELP OF ELBERETH AND LIKELY KILLED THE FOUL WINGED STEED

GILTHONIEL SIGHED PERGOLAS AS HE LOOKED UP EVEN AS HE DID SO A DARK SHAPE LIKE A CLOUD AND YET NOT A CLOUD FOR IT MOVED FAR MORE SWIFTLY CAME OUT OF THE BLACKNESS IN THE SOUTH AND SPED TOWARDS THE COMPANY BLOTTING OUT ALL LIGHT AS IT APPROACHED SOON IT APPEARED AS A GREAT WINGED CREATURE BLACKER THAN THE PITS IN THE NIGHT FIERCE VOICES ROSE UP TO GREET IT FROM ACROSS THE WATER FRODO FELT A SUDDEN CHILL RUNNING THROUGH HIM AND CLUTCHING AT HIS HEART THERE WAS A DEADLY COLD LIKE THE MEMORY OF AN OLD WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER HE CROUCHED DOWN AS IF TO HIDE

SUDDENLY THE GREAT BOW OF LORIEN SANG SHRILL WENT THE ARROW FROM THE FRODO LOOKED UP ALMOST ABOVE HIM THE WINGED SHAPE SWERVED THERE WAS A HARSH CROAKING SCREAM AS IT FELL OUT OF THE AIR VANISHING DOWN INTO THE GLOOM OF THE EASTERN SHORE THE SKY WAS CLEAN AGAIN THERE WAS A TUMULT OF MANY VOICES FAR AWAY CURSING AND WAILING IN THE DARKNESS AND THEN SILENCE NEITHER SHAFT NOR CRY CAME AGAIN FROM THE EAST THAT NIGHT
THERE ARE VARIOUS ENCOUNTERS WITH THE RINGWRAITHS IN THE BOOKS ONE CAN EVEN GO BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO TO SPOT THEM SUCH AS WHEN THE DROVE KING ARVEDUI FROM FOREMOST TO THE NORTH DOWNS IN THIRD AGE ARAGON TELLS THE HOBBITS THAT THE NINE ARE AVERSE TO FIRE

SARON CAN PUT FIRE TO HIS EVIL USES AS HE CAN ALL THINGS BUT THESE RIDERS DO NOT LOVE IT AND FEAR THOSE WHO WIELD IT A KNIFE IN THE DARK

THEY ARE ALSO AVERSE TO WATER AND SUNLIGHT

ALL EXCEPT THE WERE APT TO STRAY WHEN ALONE BY DAYLIGHT AND ALL AGAIN SAVE THE FEARED WATER AND WERE UNWILLING EXCEPT IN DIRE NEED TO ENTER IT OR TO CROSS STREAMS UNLESS DRY-SHOD BY A BRIDGE THE HUNT FOR THE RING

THERE ARE THREE EXAMPLES OF FIRE AND WATER BEING USED AGAINST THE NAZGÛL IN THE ONE INSTANCE ARAGON FENDS FIVE OF THEM OFF WITH FIRE

EVEN AS HE SWOONED HE CAUGHT AS THROUGH A SWIRLING MIST A GLIMPSE OF STRIDER LEAPING OUT OF THE DARKNESS WITH A FLAMING BRAND OF WOOD IN EITHER HAND A KNIFE IN THE DARK

GANDALF FOUGHT WITH FOUR OF THEM AT FEATHERTOP AND USED FIRE AGAINST THEM YOU WILL SEE HOW EVEN THE SUN COMES INTO PLAY BEFORE THE NIGHTTIME BATTLE

THEY DREW AWAY FROM ME FOR THEY FELT THE COMING OF MY ANGER AND THEY DARED NOT FACE IT WHILE THE SUN WAS IN THE SKY BUT THEY CLOSED ROUND AT NIGHT AND I WAS BESIEGED ON THE HILLTOP IN THE OLD RING OF AMON SAL I WAS HARD PUT TO IT INDEED SUCH LIGHT AND FLAME CANNOT HAVE BEEN SEEN ON FEATHERTOP SINCE THE OF OLD AT SUNRISE I ESCAPED AND FLED TOWARDS THE NORTHERN THE COUNCIL OF ELROD

AT THE FORD OF BRUCINE ONLY THREE OF THE NINE CROSSED INTO THE FORD WHILE THE OTHER SIX STAYED BEHIND THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO CROSS BODIES OF WATER

THE THREE RIDERS THAT WERE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE FORD WERE OVERWHELMED FLIGHT TO THE FORD

IN THIS CASE BOTH FIRE AND WATER WERE USED AS THE REMAINING NAZGÛL WERE FORCED BACK INTO THE FLOOD BY THE TORCHES THE HOBBITS AND ARAGON WERE WIELDING

THE RIDERS HESITATED ON THE SHORE SMALL SHADOWY FORMS WAVING FLAMES THAT FLARED RED IN THE GREY MIST THE BLACK HORSES WERE FILLED WITH MADNESS AND LEAPING FORWARD IN TERROR THEY BORE THEIR RIDERS INTO THE RUSHING FLOOD FLIGHT TO THE FORD

MERRY AND COLWYN BROUGHT DOWN THE THE LEADER OF THE NAZGÛL AT THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR FIELDS WITH DIFFERENT WEAPONS THAT WERE BOTH DESTROYED AFTER THEY PIERCED HIM

SWORD HAD STABBED HIM FROM BEHIND SHEARING THROUGH THE BLACK MANTLE AND PASSING UP BEHIND THE HAUBERK HAD PIERCED THE SINEW BEHIND HIS MIGHTY KNEE THEN TOTTERING STRUGGLING UP WITH HER LAST STRENGTH SHE DROVE HER SWORD BETWEEN CROWN AND MANTLE AS THE GREAT SHOULDERS BOWED BEFORE HERALDRY THE SWORD BROKE SPARKLING INTO MANY SHARDS THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR FIELDS

BROMOIL L WAS A DÚNADAN WHO THE WAS SCARED OF HE FOUGHT WITH THE NAZGÛL TO REGAIN ITHILIEN WHICH WAS OVERRUN BY ORCS FROM MORDOR IN THIRD AGE HE DIED SEVERAL YEARS LATER AFTER HE BECAME SHRUNKEN WITH PAIN THE STEWARDS BY A BEFORE THAT EÄRNUR WAS SENT TOO LATE TO AID THE PEOPLE OF ARTHEDAIN AND HE ENCOUNTERED THE WHOSE FORCES WERE DESTROYED AT THE BATTLE OF FOREMOST IN EÄRNUR IS KILLED BY THE YEAR LATER WHEN HE TAKES UP THE CHALLENGE AND RIDES OUT TO MINAS MOGUL WITH AN ESCORT OF KNIGHTS HE WAS LIKELY TAKEN AND TORTURED TO DEATH

THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THEM WAS THE SAME AS WITH SARON DESTROY THE ONE THE POWER OF THEIR MASTER IS IN THEM AND THEY STAND OR FALL BY HIM THE RING GOES SOUTH WHEN GOLLUM TOPPLED INTO THE FIRE OF ORODRUIN THEY ARE DESTROYED AS THE ONE IS UNMADE

INTO THE HEART OF THE STORM WITH A CRY THAT PIERCED ALL OTHER SOUNDS TEARING THE CLOUDS ASUNDER THE NAZGÛL CAME SHOOTING LIKE FLAMING BOLTS AS CAUGHT IN THE FIERY RUIN OF HILL AND SKY THEY CRACKLED WITHERED AND WENT OUT MOUNT DOOM

I DO NOT THINK THE NAZGÛL ARE INVINCIBLE TO WEAPONS MORGOTH WAS NOT SARON WAS NOT THEY COULD BE PIERCED MAIMED AND HURT BY WEAPONS DURING THE SIEGE OF CONDOR IT IS NOTED THAT THE HAD BEEN WARY OF MISSELS IN THE FIELD

OVER THE HILLS OF SLAIN A HIDEOUS SHAPE APPEARED A HORSEMAN TALL HOODED CLOAKED IN BLACK SLOWLY TRAMPLING THE FALLEN HE RODE FORTH HEEDING NO LONGER ANY DART HE HALTED AND HELD UP A LONG PALE SWORD AND AS HE DID SO A GREAT FEAR FELL UPON ALL DEFENDER AND FOE ALIKE AND THE HANDS OF MEN DROPPED TO THEIR SIDES AND NO BOWS SANG FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS STILL THE SIEGE OF CONDOR
NAZGÛL IT'S NAZGÛL
LOOK UP THE COMPANY FELL AND FAIR THEY MAKE EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY LOAR COSTUMES NOT SURE IF THEY HAVE ANY ELDEN COSTUMES BUT I KNOW THEY HAVE RANGER OUTFITS AND THE THIRD AGE GONDORIAN SOLDIER UNIFORMS LOOK FOR THEM ON INSTAGRAM I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A WEBSITE YET PRETTY NEW COMPANY
SARON WAS THE MOST POWERFUL OF SERVANTS AND WAS MIGHTY AMONG THE PEOPLE OF AUL I'M NOT SURE IF HE WAS ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST OF THE MAAR BUT IT DOES SEEM POSSIBLE

THE THREE RINGS WERE NOT WEAPONS BUT PERHAPS THEY COULD TO SOME DEGREE BE WIELDED AS SUCH BUT THAT WAS NOT THEIR PRIMARY FUNCTION THE FOLLOWING QUOTE MAY BE AN EXAMPLE OF THE RING ILYA USED IN SUCH A MANNER

THE RIVER OF THIS VALLEY IS UNDER HIS POWER AND IT WILL RISE IN ANGER WHEN HE HAS GREAT NEED TO BAR THE FORD AS SOON AS THE CAPTAIN OF THE RINGWRAITHS RODE INTO THE WATER THE FLOOD WAS RELEASED MANY MEETINGS

THEY WERE MEANT TO STAY TIME OR RATHER PRESERVE THINGS IN A LAND OF WANING TO BRING TO MIDDLE-EARTH AMAN AND TO PRESERVE THE BODIES OF THE ELVES THEY WERE AWARE OF THE FADING THAT OCCURRED WHERE THEIR BODIES WERE GROWING WEAK AND BREAKING DOWN PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THE TAINT OF MELIOR THIS WAS A DUAL FUNCTION OF THE THREE

I THINK GALADRIEL COULD HAVE BEATEN A FULLY POWERED MAIA HAD SHE ENGAGED IN COMBAT WITH ONE THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS HAPPENING GLORFINDEL BEAT A MAIA BARONG ECTHELION BEAT A MAIA GOTHMOG A BARONG OBVIOUSLY BOTH DIED IN THE END TOO THE SAME THING WITH HE WITH THE DÚNADAN ELENDIL BEAT SARON BUT SARON BURNED TO DEATH THERE ARE THREE EXAMPLES THERE ALONE GALADRIEL LIKE FËANOR WAS A BIT STRONGER THAN NORMAL SHE WAS ALMOST THE FEMALE VERSION OF HIM IN MIGHT WHAT IS KNOWN OF FËANOR IS THAT HE STOOD ALONE AT ONE POINT AND FOUGHT LONG AND HARD AGAINST SEVERAL BARONGS UNTIL HE WAS STRUCK DOWN SO THAT'S ONE ELF ALBEIT THE MIGHTIEST FIGHTING MULTIPLE MAAR BARONGS YET HE DID NOT BEAT ANY OF THEM

NEMO CLAIMS THAT FËANOR WOULD NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO MATCH A VALA IN MIGHT WERE HE THREE TIMES THE ELF HE CURRENTLY WAS

NONE OF THE ALAR CANST THOU OVERCOME NOW OR EVER WITHIN THE HALLS OF E NOT THOUGH ERU WHOM THOUGH GAMEST HAD MADE THEE THRICE GREATER THAN THOUGH ARTICLE OF THE FLIGHT OF THE NOLUDAR

GALADRIEL HAD BEEN DESCRIBED AS A MATCH FOR THE LOREMASTERS IN ALIENOR A MATCH FOR BOTH THE LOREMASTERS AND THE ATHLETES OF THE ELDAR IN THE DAYS OF THEIR YOUTH THE HISTORY OF GALADRIEL AND CELEBORN TO ME THIS MEANS SHE WAS QUITE CAPABLE OF HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT OR OF FIGHTING WITH WEAPONS TO GO ALONG WITH HER BOOKSMARTS SO TO SAY

NOR WERE THE LOREMASTERS A SEPARATE GUILD OF GENTLE SCRIBES SOON BURNED BY THE ORKS OF SINGBAND UPON PYRES OF BOOKS THEY WERE MOSTLY EVEN AS FËANOR THE GREATEST KINGS PRINCES AND WARRIORS SUCH AS THE VALIANT CAPTAINS OF GONDOLIER OR FIBROID OF NARGOTHROND AND RODOTHIR HIS KINSMAN AND STEWARD SHIBBOLETH OF FËANOR NOTE

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ELDEN MEN AND WOMEN MAY HAVE GENERALLY HAD DIFFERENT INCLINATIONS BUT THERE WAS LESS DIFFERENCE IN STRENGTH AND SPEED BETWEEN AND THAT HAD NOT BORNE CHILD THAN IS SEEN AMONG MORTALS OF THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS AMONG THE ELDAR SO YES IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AN ELF SUCH AS GALADRIEL COULD BEAT SARON IN COMBAT AS I'VE SHOWN WITH PREVIOUS EXAMPLES OF ELF MAIA BATTLES MAAR WERE MIGHTIER THAN ELVES INHERENTLY JUST AS THE ALAR WERE MIGHTIER THAN THE MAAR YET EVEN SO THESE DISTINCTIONS DO BLEED THROUGH TAKE FËANOR IN AMAN USING THE POWER OF HIS VOICE

THE VOICE OF FËANOR GREW SO GREAT AND SO POTENT THAT EVEN THE HERALD OF THE ALAR BOWED BEFORE HIM AS ONE AND DEPARTED AND THE NOLUDAR WERE OVERRULED OF THE FLIGHT OF THE NOLUDAR

HIS VOICE AFFECTED THE NOLUDAR AND A MAIA

THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER ENCOUNTERS THAT I'LL MENTION FINGOLFIN FOUGHT THE VALA MORGOTH AND THOUGH HE CAME OUT LIKE A FIREBRAND AND WOUNDED MORGOTH SEVERAL TIMES HE WAS EVENTUALLY POUNDED INTO THE DUST THIS IS AT A POINT IN TIME WHERE THERE ARE SOME WHO ASSUME MORGOTH WAS LESS POWERFUL THAN SARON A MAIA BECAUSE OF A TEXT THAT SAYS THAT SARON WAS GREATER EFFECTIVELY IN THE SECOND AGE THAN HIS MASTER WAS AT THE END OF THE FIRST AGE THIS IS A BAD READING IMO SINCE THIS HAS LESS TO DO WITH A MEASUREMENT OF POTENCY AND A COMPARISON THEREOF THAN OF THE FAULTS OF INCLINATIONS COMPARED TO THE MUCH LESS POWERFUL SARON MORGOTH WAS DESCRIBED AS A TITAN AT THE END OF THE FIRST AGE BUT ALSO AS A SHELL LOOKING LIKE THAT PIECE OF SOUL HARRY SAW UNDER THE SUBWAY SEAT IN HIS VISION OF HIS FORMER MIGHT I ARGUE THAT MORGOTH AS A SHELL OF HIMSELF EVEN LESS STRONG THAN HE WAS AT HIS PRIME WAS STILL A VALA LEVEL AINU

LÚTHIEN AND BEDEN IN DUNGEONS PUT A BUNCH OF AINU TO SLEEP THE LAST BIGGEST AND STRONGEST OF THEM ALL MORGOTH TOPPLES TO THE GROUND LIKE A HUGE AVALANCHE OFF OF A MOUNTAIN THIS WAS NOT NECESSARILY A BATTLE BUT LÚTHIEN DID PROMPTLY GET INTO HER GOSPEL SONG AFTER MORGOTH STRIPPED THEM OF THEIR DISGUISES FINALLY THERE IS THE FIBROID AND SARON RAP BATTLE WHERE FIBROID EVENTUALLY FELL TO SARON AND HE THEN STRIPPED HIM AND HIS COMPANIONS OF THEIR DISGUISES AND THREW THEM IN JAIL SARON KEPT FIBROID FOR LAST IN THE DUNGEONS BECAUSE HE FIGURED HE WAS SOME MIGHTY PRINCE OF THE NOLUDAR WHO HE COULD NOT PIN A NAME TO
I DON'T HAVE A SOURCE BUT I READ A RESPONSE BY ANOTHER REDDITION A FEW DAYS AGO THAT EXPLAINED THAT GANDALF WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO STOOD A CHANCE AGAINST SARON SO THAT WOULD MEAN GANDALF SARON GALADRIAL NOT SURE WHERE SAURURAN WOULD FALL
APPLES AND ORANGES AS FAR AS I'M AWARE ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE A MAIA WOULD LOSE TO AN ELDAR EVEN WITH ONE OF THE ELDEN RINGS CONSIDERING SARON AND GANDALF ARE OF SIMILAR DESCENT I WOULD ASSUME SARON WOULD BE MORE POWERFUL GIVEN AGES OF WAR AS OPPOSED TO MORE VERBAL APPROACH TO RESOLVING MATTERS

GANDALF WITH THE RING OF FIRE THOUGH WOULD REASONABLY BEAT A WEAKENED SARON GALADRIEL NO SHOT I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE USING A MOVIE PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS INHERENTLY FLAWED
SORRY BUT SARON KICKS HER ASS FOR SURE NOT EVEN CLOSE IMHO
MAYBE TRY SHARING THIS ON THE OTHER SUBREDDITS IF THIS GUY LIKES THE BOOKS AS MUCH AS HE SAYS THEN I'M SURE THE OTHER SUBS WON'T MIND
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY THIS AGAIN BUT APPARENTLY I HAVE TO SAY THIS AGAIN NO POLITICS KEEP IT OUT OF THIS SUB

EDIT THE GUY IS WEARING A PIN YOU CAN BARELY SEE THAT DOESN'T MAKE THIS A POLITICAL POST SO THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE POST IF YOU CAN'T REFRAIN FROM MAKING COMMENTS THAT DON'T BELONG HERE WE HAVE SOLUTIONS FOR THAT
BOARDER
THERE WAS ANY DOUBT OF HIS HOBBITYNESS
FUN STORY MY SISTER MET SEAN ASTIN IN BOSTON WHILE HE WAS IN TOWN DROPPING OFF HIS DAUGHTER AT COLLEGE SHE SAID HE IS A SUPER GROUNDED AND DOWN TO EARTH GUY HE EVEN GAVE HER HIS NUMBER AND HIS NUMBER MY SISTER REFUSES TO GIVE ME HIS NUMBER BUT SHE DID SAVE IT
THAT PICTURE LOOKS LIKE IT WAS TAKEN AT SOFT SERVE IN STEVENS POINT WI
WHEE THE JUICE
HE'S WEARING GLASSES NOW TO SHOW THAT TIME HAS PASSED
NICE TRY GOLD KEY MOTORS
HOW DOES THAT STAND UP
RUDY RUDY RUDY
IT LOOKS HEAVY
WENT TO THIS Q A AT A LOCAL CON HE'S A REALLY POWERFUL SPEAKER WHILE BEING SUPER CHILL ABOUT IT INTERESTINGLY HIS HEALTH IS HIS NUMBER ONE PRIORITY HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW DEPRESSED HE WAS WHILE FILMING LOAR BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH WEIGHT HE HAD TO GAIN WHILE HE WAS HERE HE WENT AND JOINED A BUNCH OF LOCALS FOR A NIGHT JOG IN THE CITY AWESOME GUY
WAS SO DISAPPOINTED HE WAS IN MY TOWN AND DIDN'T GET TO MEET HIM
ICE CRAM IS MY ADDICTION I COULD EAT THAT IN MIN FLAT
HE IS MAKING ME FEEL OLD
REMOVED
BELTS
THAT WAS HIS SECOND BREAKFAST
ICE-CREAM AND SECOND ICE-CREAM
THEY CALL THAT THE ISENGARD
REMOVED
REMOVED
HE ACTUALLY LOOKS MORMON
I GUESS THAT MAKES ME PART HOBBIT AS WELL
THAT'S MORE THAN A PINT CLOSER TO A QUART
ICE CREAM OES
THAT CONE IS ACTUALLY ONLY TALL
THIS MAKES ME WANT TO GET INSTAGRAM JUST TO FOLLOW HIM
WITH A HIGH ENOUGH ESTOP HOLDING IT TOWARDS THE LENS YOU TOO CAN DO THIS WITH ANY SOFTSERVE CONE
HONESTLY HAVING READ THE BOOKS BEFORE ANY OF THE FILMS CAME OUT SEAN ASTIN CAME AS CLOSE TO WHAT I PICTURED THE HOBBITS AS BOTH IN LOOKS AND MANNERISMS AS ANYONE COULD A BIT STOUT BUT NOT OVERLY CHUBBY AFFABLE AND CHEERFUL FOND OF FOOD AND DRINK AND A LITTLE BIT MISCHIEVOUS WHEN THE SITUATION ALLOWED
THEY'RE TAKING THE ROBBINS TO ISENGARD
BOARDER
HE CAME TO SPEAK AT GA WHILE I WAS A FRESHMAN A BUNCH OF US WENT OUT LATER AND MET UP WITH SOME OLDER STUDENTS WHO HAD JUST COME FROM OUR LOCAL STRIP CLUB THEY SAID SA WAS JUST THERE CHILLING BY HIMSELF AND THAT IT SEEMED LIKE HE GAVE ZERO FUCKS ABOUT IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY COOL GUY
REMOVED
I DON'T KNOW IF HOBBITS RUN MARATHONS VERY OFTEN HE'LL BE RUNNING IN PORTLAND SOON
REMOVED
REMOVED
REMOVED
DELETED
LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOTTEN OUT OF SHAPE SINCE HE DID THAT IRONMAN A COUPLE YEARS BACK
BELONGS IN R LOTRMEMES BUT I'VE HAD AN AWFUL DAY AND THIS REALLY MADE ME LAUGH SO THANK YOU
MOSTLY JUST HIS GARDNER MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE LARGELY BECAUSE THE MOVIES DON'T REALLY SHOW IT THAT EACH OF THE HOBBITS ARE ARISTOCRATS EXCEPT FOR IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL FRODO MERRY AND PIPPIN EACH COME FROM UPPERCLASS ALMOST NOBLE FAMILIES IN THE SHIRE SAM IS MORE OF A COMMONER AND THEREFORE DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE OTHER THREE

SAM CALLS HIM MASTER BECAUSE FRODO IS HIS EMPLOYER
THEY WERE ON FRIENDLY TERMS BUT STILL CONSCIOUS OF THE STATUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM FRODO WAS WEALTHY UPPER CLASS THANKS TO BEING TAKEN IN BY BILBO WHILE SAM WAS WORKING CLASSICAL THIS ALL COMES OUT OF OLD ENGLISH TRADITIONS FRODO AND RELATIONSHIP I BELIEVE IS SOMEWHAT INSPIRED BY THE TRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN ENGLISH OFFICER AND HIS BATMAN OR PERSONAL VALET
GREAT ANSWERS HERE IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO WATCH THEIR FRIENDSHIP GROW THROUGHOUT THE STORY ONE OF THE GREATEST ROMANCES OUT THERE IF YOU'LL FORGIVE THE COLLOQUIALISM
WERE FRODO AND SAM FRIENDS BEFORE THEY BEGAN THEIR JOURNEY AWAY FROM THE SHIRE

THEY WERE MOST CERTAINLY FRIENDLY AND ON VERY GOOD TERMS BUT CLOSEST FRIENDS BEFORE THE QUEST WERE MERRY PIPPIN AND FREDREGAR SAM WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST HIS GARDENER BUT THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THEY DIDN'T LIKE ONE ANOTHER

AND WHY DOES SAM CALL FRODO HIS MASTER

BECAUSE FRODO IS HIS MASTER HE IS IN THE EMPLOY OF MR FRODO I THINK THE USE OF THE WORD MASTER RATHER THAN SIR OR SOMETHING EQUATABLE DERIVES CHIEFLY FROM THE ANTIQUATED TENDENCIES OF HOBBITS
MASTER WAS BASICALLY CALLING SOMEONE MISTER OR SIR IN THE GENERAL TIME PERIOD LOAR WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN
IN ADDITION TO THE ANSWERS YOU HAVE ALREADY I'LL JUST SAY THAT IN THAT SORT OF MILITARY MASTER SERVANT RELATIONSHIP THERE WAS OFTEN A BIG BOND OF TRUST AND DEVOTION ESPECIALLY FROM THE SERVANT WHICH EXPLAINS A LITTLE SOMETIMES ZEALOUS ATTACHMENT TO FRODO
FRODO MERRY AND PIPPIN WERE COUSINS AND THEY WERE ALL FROM IMPORTANT FAMILIES THE BAGGINESS THE BOOKS THE BRANDYBUCKS SAM WAS NOT FROM AN IMPORTANT FAMILY AND HE WAS GARDENER NOW FRODO AND BILBO BEFORE HIM WERE MORE EGALITARIAN THAN THE REST OF THE SHIRE AS IT IS MENTIONED EARLY ON THAT BILBO TREATED THE GAFFER WITH MORE RESPECT THAN HE NECESSARILY HAD TO AND BILBO TAUGHT SAM HIS LETTERS FRODO ALSO KICKS PIPPIN FOR ORDERING SAM AROUND

HOWEVER THERE IS ALSO LATER ON A CHAPTER CALLED THE CHOICES OF MASTER PALMWISE

BUT BASICALLY THE OTHER HOBBITS WERE ARISTOCRATS WHILE SAM WAS A COMMONER MERRY AND PIPPIN WERE AS CLOSE TO NOBILITY AS YOU COULD GET IN THE SHIRE AND FRODO WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO BOTH FAMILIES SAM IS THE ONLY ONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS A JOB
THE HOBBIT IS A STORY THAT IS SEPARATE FROM BUT LINKED TO THE LORD OF THE RINGS THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS A SPECIFIC TELLING OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE RING THAT WAS FOUND IN THE HOBBIT

THE SIMARILLIAN IS A COLLECTION OF WRITING TO INCLUDE THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE THE HISTORY OF THE ELVES SOME OF THE HISTORY OF CERTAIN MEN THE CREATION OF THE RING AND SOME OTHER HAPPENINGS IN THE MIDDLE EARTH THAT ARE ALLUDED TO IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS

THERE ARE OTHER COLLECTIONS OF WRITINGS THAT ADD TO PARTS OF MIDDLE EARTH AND SOME OF THE NOTABLE PERSONS

NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS AS COMPLETE A NARRATIVE OR WRITTEN AS A BOOK SERIES NOT A TRILOGY

IF YOU READ THE HOBBIT AND THE LOAR YOU HAVE READ WHAT WAS INTENDED TO BE PUBLISHED BY JNR TZOLKIN EVERYTHING ELSE SERVES TO TELL US MORE ABOUT TOLKIENS MIDDLE EARTH AND IT IS ALL GLORIOUS AND WILL ADD TO YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS IF THE WRITING APPEALS TO YOU SOME OF IT IS VERY STIFF AND SOME OF IT IS BRILLIANTLY ELEGANT BUT IT IS INCONSISTENT AS IT WAS NEVER PREPARED BY JNR FOR RELEASE IT IS ALL EDITED BY HIS SON CHRISTOPHER
R LOAR COMMENTS

DON'T WORRY ABOUT RUNNING OUT OF EPIC AND GRASPING MIDDLE-EARTH BOOKS AFTER FINISHING LOAR AND HOBBIT I LIKED CHILDREN OF AURIN MORE THAN THE HOBBIT
I'LL BE THE ONE TO SAY IT FRODO NEVER GOT MARRIED
HAHA
BUT WHY DOES HE HAVE ALL TEN FINGERS
BUT WHY DOES HE HAVE ALL TEN FINGERS
IT IS ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL HOW MUCH THEY ARE CHARGING FOR THIS SUCH BLATANT MONEY GRABBING AND NOT GIVING AN ABSOLUTE SHIT ABOUT WHAT THE FANS CAN AND CANNOT AFFORD I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS EDITION AND WHEN I SAW THIS MY HEART SUNK I'M SUCH A HUGE FAN OF THE BOOKS AND FILMS AND HAVE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING TZOLKIN YOU COULD THINK BUT I WILL NEVER BUY THIS
IT DOESN'T CONTAIN THE DOCUMENTARIES I WOULDN'T CALL THIS A ULTIMATE COLLECTION
TECHNICALLY MAIL CHAIN MAIL THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PLATE MAIL IT SHOULD BE REFERRED TO AS PLATE ARMOR OR SIMPLY PLATE TZOLKIN SAID MAIL AND THIS MEANS CHAIN HE DIDN'T SAY PLATE BREASTPLATE GORGET RONDEL OR ANY OF THE OTHER TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH PLATE ARMOR

2 IT FITS ALL THE FACTS BETTER MIDDLE EARTH SEEMS TO BE IN A PERPETUAL DARK AGES SO FAR AS TECH IS CONCERNED TRUE PLATE ARMOR CAME LATER AROUND THE SAME TIME AS GUNPOWDER WEAPONS THE ARGUMENT COULD BE MADE FOR LAMELLAR OR SCALE ARMOR BUT NEITHER OF THESE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY HE SAID MAIL NOT SCALES OR ROWS OF SMALL METAL PLATES

MOST COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF ARMOR COMES IN THE HOBBIT WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT THE DWARVES OF THE IRON HILLS THESE ARE CONSIDERED VERY FOR MIDDLE-EARTH

EACH ONE OF HIS FOLK WAS CLAD IN A HAUBERK OF STEEL MAIL THAT HUNG TO HIS KNEES AND HIS LEGS WERE COVERED WITH HOSE OF A FINE AND FLEXIBLE METAL MESH THE SECRET OF WHOSE MAKING WAS POSSESSED BY PEOPLE

A HAUBERK IS NOT PLATE ARMOR HOSE OF FINE AND FLEXIBLE METAL MESH IS NOT PLATE ARMOR

IF PLATE ARMOR EXISTED IN MIDDLE EARTH I WOULD EXPECT THE DWARVES OF THE IRON HILLS TO BE WEARING IT

THEY WEREN'T

TZOLKIN NEVER TALKS ABOUT PLATE ARMOR AT ALL HE KEEPS SAYING MAIL

AND TZOLKIN A HISTORIAN AND LINGUIST KNEW THAT MAIL MEANS CHAIN MAIL

TL R THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY REFERENCE TO PLATE ARMOR ANYWHERE IN MIDDLE EARTH
PRINCE IMAHRIL IS DESCRIBED IN RETURN OF THE KING AS WEARING VAMBRACES BUT IT DOES NOT SAY IF THEY WERE METAL OR LEATHER THE HARADRIM AND EASTERLING ARE DESCRIBED AS WEARING OVERLADING BRAZEN PLATES IN THE TWO TOWERS BUT THAT COULD DESCRIBE EITHER SCALE ARMOR AKA SCALE MAIL OR SOMETHING LAMELLAR LIKE A ROMAN LORICA SEGMENT
DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY BUT YOU LOOK LIKE AN CGI CHARACTER TO ME
THERE WERE ONLY RINGS OF POWER

NOT QUITE

THERE WERE ONLY RINGS OF POWER WITH CAPITAL LETTERS GANDALF KNEW FROM SAURURAN THAT OF THEM WERE SET WITH A GEMSTONE

BUT THERE WERE A METRIC OF LESSER MAGIC RINGS WHICH SAURURAN CALLED ROUND AND UNADORNED

GANDALF THOUGHT THAT BILBO HAD FOUND ONE OF THESE

AND THAT'S KIND OF PLAYING WITH FIRE FOR A HOBBIT SO HE KEPT AN EYE ON THE LITTLE GUY TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING TURNED OUT OKAY

IT WASN'T UNTIL THE NIGHT OF FAREWELL BIRTHDAY PARTY THAT GANDALF REALIZED THINGS WEREN'T TURNING OUT OKAY AND SOMETHING REALLY NOT COOL WAS GOING ON
TO RECAP WHAT OTHERS SAID WE HAVE ONE OF TWO POSSIBILITIES

GANDALF DIDN'T REALLY KNOW IT WAS A GREAT RING AT FIRST AND JUST THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE MANY MISCELLANEOUS LESSER RINGS I DON'T LIKE THIS EXPLANATION BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO CONTRADICT ONE OF HIS LATER QUOTES I WONDERED OFTEN HOW GOLLUM CAME BY A GREAT RING AS PLAINLY IT WAS THAT AT LEAST WAS CLEAR FROM THE FIRST BUT ONE COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT WHEN HE SAID THAT WAS CLEAR FROM THE FIRST HE JUST MEANT LIKE IN HINDSIGHT AS IN LOOKING BACK IT'S OBVIOUS IT WAS A GREAT RING BUT I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW IT AT THE TIME THOUGH TO ME THAT'S A STRETCH AND I'M NOT A FAN OF THIS EXPLANATION

2 GANDALF KNEW IT WAS A GREAT RING BUT ASSUMED IT WAS ONE THE DWARVES RINGS NOW IT'S TRUE THAT THE DWARVES RINGS HAD ALL EITHER BEEN DESTROYED OR RECLAIMED AND ALSO THAT THE MAIN NINETEEN GREAT RINGS ARE ALL ADORNED WITH JEWELS AND THAT ONLY THE ONE RING AND THE LESSER RINGS WERE PLAIN BUT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD GANDALF JUST DIDN'T KNOW THESE THINGS AT THE TIME GANDALF PROBABLY ALSO UNDERESTIMATED THE DANGER THAT EVEN ONE OF THE DWARVES RINGS WOULD POSE THIS IS THE EXPLANATION THAT I FIND MORE LIKELY BUT REALLY EITHER ONE WOULD WORK

REMEMBER THAT RINGLORE WAS PRIMARILY THE DOMAIN OF SAURURAN PRESUMABLY SUCH KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF THE RINGS AND WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE WAS EXCLUSIVE TO SAURURAN SARON AND MAYBE THE LIKES OF GALADRIEL AND ELROD IT WASN'T UNTIL HIS PERIOD OF RESEARCH IN THE SEVENTEEN YEARS IN BETWEEN BIRTHDAY AND DEPARTURE BEHIND BACK THAT GANDALF REALLY BEGAN TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE RINGS AND THEIR FATES THOUGH THIS DOES BEG THE QUESTION OF WHY GANDALF DECIDED TO WASTE SO MUCH TIME WITHOUT LOOKING INTO THESE MATTERS AS SOON AS HE ARRIVED IN MIDDLE EARTH BUT AGAIN SUCH QUESTIONS WERE UNDER JURISDICTION AND IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER THAT GANDALF BEGAN TO MISTRUST SAURURAN

ALL OF THAT SAID I WOULD ADD TO THIS ANOTHER THING THAT GANDALF MENTIONED TO FRODO WHEN FRODO ASKS WHETHER GRANDALF WILL MAKE HIM GIVE UP THE RING OR SOMETHING GANDALF RESPONDS

I COULD NOT MAKE YOU EXCEPT BY FORCE WHICH WOULD BREAK YOUR MIND

SO EVEN IF GANDALF KNEW RIGHT FROM THE START THAT THIS WAS THE ONE RING HE DIDN'T BUT STILL THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH HE COULD DO ABOUT IT IF HE CARED ABOUT SPARING BILBO GANDALF STRONGLY DISCOURAGED BILBO FROM USING THE RING EXCEPT IN DIRE SITUATIONS BUT BEYOND THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH HE CAN DO BUT WATCH AND WAIT TAKING DRASTIC MEASURE WOULD PROBABLY RESULT IN BILBO LOSING HIS MIND AND OR LIFE AND IF HE THOUGHT THAT THE RING WAS JUST A LESSER RING OR MAYBE ONE OF THE DWARVES RINGS ANYWAY IT WASN'T WORTH THE RISK DISCOURAGING BILBO FROM USING IT TOO OFTEN WAS PROBABLY ENOUGH
ALL THREE ARAGON PERGOLAS AND GIMLI WERE GIVEN ARMOR BY THRODDEN IN EDORA PRIOR TO SETTING OUT FOR DEEP

NOW MEN CAME BEARING RAIMENT OF WAR FROM THE HOARD AND THEY ARRAYED ARAGON AND PERGOLAS IN SHINING MAIL HELMS TOO THEY CHOSE AND ROUND SHIELDS THEIR BOSSES WERE OVERLAID WITH GOLD AND SET WITH GEMS GREEN AND RED AND WHITE GANDALF TOOK NO ARMOUR AND GIMLI NEEDED NO COAT OF RINGS EVEN IF ONE HAD BEEN FOUND TO MATCH HIS STATURE FOR THERE WAS NO HAUBERK IN THE HOARDS OF EDORA OF BETTER MAKE THAN HIS SHORT CORSLET FORGED BENEATH THE MOUNTAIN IN THE NORTHERN BUT HE CHOSE A CAP OF IRON AND LEATHER THAT FITTED WELL UPON HIS ROUND HEAD AND A SMALL SHIELD HE ALSO TOOK IT BORE THE RUNNING HORSE WHITE UPON GREEN THAT WAS THE EMBLEM OF THE HOUSE OF CEORL

PERGOLAS HAD A MAIL COAT A HELM AND A ROUND SHIELD HE ALSO HAD HIS KNIFE BOW AND QUIVER FROM LOTHLÓRIEN
FANWE CREATED THEM WHEN ARDA WAS POPULATED WITH CREATURES BUT TO SERVE HIM LIKE MAAR IN A WAY AND IMMORTAL BUT NOT CREATED BY ILLÚVATAR HIMSELF THORONDOR LIVED ON THE PELOPI MOUNTAINS BUT HIS DESCENDANTS LIVED IN THE EAGLE'S EYRIE IN THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AND SERVED RADAGAST GANDALF AND THE ELVES OF RIVENDELL
THEY'RE A DEUS EX MACHINA
IT ALWAYS FEELS A LITTLE FORCED WHEN HE DOES THIS BUT I DON'T MIND IT BECAUSE I HOPE THAT A FAN OF HIS WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH TZOLKIN BEYOND THE MOVIES IN AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT COLBERT IS TALKING ABOUT
THE SILMARILLION IS A TOUGH READ IF YOU AREN'T AN AVID READER I LOVE IT BUT ONLY AFTER READING IT SEVERAL TIMES IT READS LIKE THE BIBLE DELIBERATELY ARCHAIC AND WITH LITTLE ATTEMPT TO DRAW IN THE CASUAL READER

THE HOBBIT WAS DESIGNED TO BE READ TO CHILDREN BUT IT HAS HUMOR IN IT THAT'S AIMED AT ADULTS IT'S THE EASIEST AND QUICKEST READ AND YOU MIGHT CONSIDER READING IT FIRST IT WAS PUBLISHED FIRST AFTER ALL IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIES

THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS A BEAUTIFUL BALANCE BETWEEN THE HOBBIT AND THE SILMARILLION TZOLKIN INTENDED TO MERELY WRITE A SEQUEL TO THE HOBBIT FOR CHILDREN BUT HE KEPT LETTING THE SILMARILLION LEAK INTO THE BOOK UNTIL HE HAD SOMETHING FAR TOO COMPLEX AND MASSIVE FOR MOST CHILDREN AND YET FAR MORE RELATABLE THAN THE SILMARILLION IT'S REALLY FOR ADULTS BUT STILL HAS MUCH OF THE APPEAL AND INNOCENCE OF A GREAT CHILDREN'S BOOK

THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS WRITTEN IN SIX BOOKS THE DIVISION INTO THREE VOLUMES THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING THE TWO TOWERS AND THE RETURN OF THE KING IS ARBITRARY BOOK ONE STILL HAS THE FLAVOR OF THE HOBBIT A BOOK FOR CHILDREN INCLUDING THE CONTROVERSIAL CHARACTER TOM BOBADIL WHO RUBS SOME READERS THE WRONG WAY THE MAIN ACTION OF THE SERIES REALLY STARTS IN BOOK TWO AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE BEGINNING CHAPTERS OF BOOK SIX THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL CHAPTERS ABOUT THE AFTERMATH

IF YOU SAW THE MOVIES YOU MISSED MUCH OF BOOKS ONE AND SIX WHICH WERE CUT BUT THE MOVIES ALSO HAD A VERY DIFFERENT PACING FROM THE BOOKS MUCH FASTER MORE CONSTANT ACTION THE BOOKS CAN GLOSS OVER FIGHTING THAT IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE MOVIES AND CAN DWELL ON SUCH DETAILS AS FOOD AND DRINK AND SONG AND STORIES THAT ARE CUT TO A MINIMUM IN THE MOVIES

THERE IS ALSO A PROLOGUE AND SEVERAL APPENDICES WHICH YOU CAN SKIP IF YOU WANT TO SHORTEN YOUR READING THEY PROVIDE BACKGROUND BUT ARE NOT NECESSARY TO THE STORY
JUST FINISHING MY FIRST READ THROUGH THE LOAR AND READ THE SILMARILLION AND UNFINISHED TALES IN THE PAST MONTHS

THE ANSWER FROM U WBC IS SPOT ON
IF ANY ADVICE I CAN ADD TO IT IS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE BORING AT PARTS VERY DENSE AND SLOW TZOLKIN SPENDS PARAGRAPHS DESCRIBING THE SCENERY OF THE JOURNEY SO PREPARE TO PERSIST THROUGH SLOW CHAPTERS

IT'S WRITTEN IN POV OF THE HOBBITS IN THE FELLOWSHIP AND THEN IN THE TWO TOWERS AND RETURN OF THE KING YOU GET ARAGORNS POV

UNDERSTANDING THE POV HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WILL KNOW AS A READER AND WHAT WILL REMAIN IN THE DARK SOME ACTION SCENES THAT ARE IN THE MOVIE ARE SIMPLY IMPLIED BASED OFF OF WHAT CHARACTERS HEAR OR POSSIBLY SEE

YOU WILL HAVE TO STRETCH YOUR IMAGINATION TO GET THE BIG PICTURE THESE SOUND LIKE PROBLEMS BUT IN ACTUALITY IT MAKES FOR AN AMAZING READ AND MAKES YOU WANT MORE FROM THE WORLD THAT TZOLKIN CREATES GODSPEED FRIEND
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT BUT READING YOU'LL FIND WHAT YOU GET SUCH AS GRIEF WITH MEMORY

MEMORY IS NOT WHAT THE HEART DESIRES THAT IS ONLY A MIRROR BE IT CLEAR AS FAREWELL TO LORIEN

THESE ARE SOME OF THE EMOTIONS FELT AT THE INEVITABLE PASSING AWAY OF THE ELDER CHILDREN OF ERU
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY COULDN'T GET THROUGH THE BOOKS BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE SAY THAT THEY DIDN'T LIKE THEM AFTER HAVING FINISHED THEM IT'S A WONDERFUL STORY YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU READ THEM

I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT IF YOU DECIDE AFTER READING THEM THAT YOU WANT MORE OF THE LORE I WOULD SUGGEST STARTING WITH THE APPENDIX TO THE RETURN OF THE KING IT'S FILLED WITH BACKGROUND INFO AND ADDITIONAL LORE BUT IT'S MUCH LESS DENSE AND GRUELING THAN THE SILMARILLION IT TELLS ALL ABOUT THE FATE OF EACH MEMBER OF THE FELLOWSHIP AFTER THE STORY GIVES DETAIL ABOUT THE LOVE STORY BETWEEN ARAGON AND ARWEN AND EVEN SHEDS LIGHT ON THE HISTORY OF CONDOR AND ROHAN AND THE OTHER KINGDOMS IT'S AWESOME
ONE RECOMMENDATION PICK UP THE ATLAS OF MIDDLE EARTH AND KEEP IT HANDY AS YOU READ EITHER THE HOBBIT OR LOAR SHE HAS CHAPTERS THAT TRACE THE JOURNEYS ACROSS MULTIPLE MAPS VERY HELPFUL FOR KEEPING TRACK OF EVERYONE'S LOCATION AT ANY GIVEN TIME

BEYOND ITS UTILITY IT'S A MASTERPIECE FOR ANY TZOLKIN FAN OR ONE WHO SHARES LOVE OF MAPS
THE KEY TO READING THE LOAR BOOKS IS THAT YOU CAN'T READ THEM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU THE READER ARE EXPERIENCING THESE EVENTS EXACTLY AS THE CHARACTERS EXPERIENCE THEM INSTEAD THE BEST WAY IS TO APPROACH THE STORY IS AS IF YOU'RE READING AN EPIC MYTH WHERE YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS THE READER IS FAR REMOVED BY BOTH TIME AND TRANSLATION FROM THE ACTION OF THE STORY LIKE THE ILIAD

UPLOADS
I THINK I'M IN LOVE
OH MY GOOD LORD THESE ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NAILS I HAVE EVER LAID EYES ON
THAT'S SO COOL

ON MY BUCKET LIST IS MONT IN NORTHWESTERN FRANCE WHICH IS SAID TO BE THE INSPIRATION BEHIND MINAS TIGRISH
LAUTERBRUNNEN IN SWITZERLAND WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR ART OF RIVENDELL
I THINK WAS THE BEST BUT HAD SOME AWESOME FEATURES WAS ALWAYS FUN AND WAR OF THE RING WAS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GAMES THAT ONCE EVERY YEAR OR SO I STILL LOAD IT BACK UP AND PLAY IT SOLID FOR A WEEK OR MORE IT'S JUST SO EASY TO GET INTO AND A LOT OF FUN THE HERO AND UNIT LEVELLING IS SO AWESOME AND REWARDING WHILE PLAYING TOO
ACTUALLY THERE ALREADY IS A HUGE MOD FOR 2 WHICH IS TOTALLY LIKE A NEW GAME AND CLOSER TO THAN TO THE SEQUEL IN TERM OF ITS CALLED DAIN MOD AND ITS ALREADY IN ITS 4TH VERSION AND THEN DEVELOPERS ARE WORKING AND UPDATING IT ACTIVELY FOR ABOUT YEARS NOW ITS MORE LIKE A NEW GAME OF THE SERIES THAN LIKE A MOD BECAUSE ITS THAT BIG
I WASN'T REALLY A COMPUTER GAMER BUT I REMEMBER PLAYING THIS GAME SO MUCH IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS SO FUN TO PLAY AS CONDOR
HOLY SHIT YES THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME I PLAYED THIS SO MUCH GROWING UP I'LL DEFINITELY BE FOLLOWING THIS PROJECT
OH CRAP WAS THE ONE WHERE YOU COULD MAKE THE SWORDSMEN STAND AROUND THE ARCHERS MAKING ONE LARGE UNIT INSTEAD OF 2 SMALL ONES RIGHT
IF ONLY TOTAL WAR WOULD DO A LOAR VERSION
BEME WAS GREAT BUT MAN I FEEL LIKE SHADOWS OF MORDOR SURPASSED IT
BOTH BEME AND BEME 2 ARE AWESOME I HAVE THEM BOTH INSTALLED BUT I USUALLY PLAY BEME 2 WITH ROTOW BECAUSE OF THE DAIN MOD
BEME INTRODUCED ME TO MAPPING AND CODDING WHICH LED ME INTO GAME PROGRAMMING THE MOST INFLUENTIAL GAME OF MY LIFE
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS I PLAY BEME 2 EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN I GET THE URGE HAVEN'T PLAYED THE ORIGINAL IN A LONG TIME BUT NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
WAR IN THE NORTH WOULD EASILY TAKE MY VOTE BUT IT FELT LIKE THE DEVELOPMENT WAS CUT SHORT STILL AMAZING GAMEPLAY
YES YES YES OH GOD YES
I LOVED THIS GAME WHEN IT ORIGINALLY CAME OUT ON PC AND SINCE I'VE MOVED AND HAD MANY NEW SYSTEMS I'VE LOST THE GAME AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO BACK AND PLAY IT HOPEFULLY THIS WILL FEED MY APPETITE
BEME IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE GAMES I STILL HAVE ALL INSTALLED ON MY LAPTOP
ANY REBALANCING THE MORDOR FACTION IS HILARIOUSLY BAD COMPARED TO THE OTHER THREE
LEGO LOAR IS MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE LOAR GAME I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT
DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE TIME TO WATCH ALL OF THOSE DEMO VIDEOS WHAT EXACTLY IS SO DIFFERENT IN THE GAME BESIDE THE ONE OBVIOUS THING NO UI


THIS LOOKS AWESOME BUT I CAN'T EVER GET MYSELF TO PLAY RTS GAMES FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME AFTER TOTAL WAR ALL THE ARMIES JUST LOOK SMALL AND MEANINGLESS COMPARED TO THE COLOSSAL BATTALIONS FEATURED IN TOTAL WAR
THANK YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET TO WORK ONLINE FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW SINCE MY LAPTOP NO LONGER SUPPORTS DVDS
OH FUCK YEAH I LOST MY HARD COPY IF THE GAME WHEN I MOVED TO MELBOURNE AND THEY'RE SUPER EXPENSIVE ON EBAY AND I DON'T TRUST MYSELF TO DOWNLOAD IT THIS IS AWESOME THANK YOU SO MUCH
THE DEVELOPMENT FORUMS ARE FOUND HERE

I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS MOD FOR A WHILE AND I AM SUPER EXCITED

DELETED
DON'T TELL THE OLDFAG ABOUT THIS
WAS HOPING HE'D TOSS HIM INTO SOMETHING
FIRST OFF BALIN AND HIS COMPANY WOULD HAVE ENTERED THROUGH THE EAST GATE WHICH WAS NOT PROTECTED BY A SECRET DWARFISH DOOR SECONDLY THE PASSWORD FOR THE DOOR WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMMON KNOWLEDGE AS MORIA HAD BEEN ABANDONED FOR CENTURIES AND CENTURIES AND GIMLI WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO KNOW AN ELVISH WORD LET ALONE FIGURE OUT IT WAS A RIDDLE OF SORTS

THIRDLY IT WASN'T REALLY CITY AS THE EXPEDITION SENT THERE TO RECLAIM IT WAS SMALL AND COULDN'T REALLY BE CONSIDERED CONQUERED FOURTHLY WORD WOULDN'T HAVE SPREAD BECAUSE THERE WERE NO SURVIVORS FROM THE EXPEDITION AND THE DWARVES OF THE LONELY MOUNTAIN HAD SENT NO MESSENGERS OR EXPEDITIONS TO DISCOVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED THOUGH THEY FEARED THE WORST

GANDALF DIDN'T KNOW FULL WELL WHAT HAPPENED BUT HAD HIS OWN FEARS AS MUCH OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS WERE INHABITED BY ORCS AND MORIA WAS NO EXCEPTION
IN REGARDS TO NOT KNOWING THE PASSWORD WASN'T THE DOOR A SECRET ENTRANCE I'M GUESSING GIMLI ONLY EVER VISITED DURING MOSTLY PEACEFUL TIMES IF HE HAD EVER VISITED AT ALL SO THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HIM TO USE THE SECRET ENTRANCE OR KNOW THE PASSWORD

I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FEAR WAS MORE OF A SENSE OF FOREBODING RATHER THAN KNOWING FOR SURE I ALMOST GET THE IMPRESSION HE SENSED THE BARONG RATHER THAN THE GOBLINS

IN REGARDS TO THE WORD BEING SPREAD REMEMBER THAT DWARFS WERE ALWAYS VERY PRIVATE AND OBSESSED WITH GOLD AND RICHES IT WOULD BE PRETTY STANDARD TO NOT HEAR FROM THEM FOR DECADES AT A TIME AS THEY EXPLORED A NEW SEAM
WHY DOESN'T GIMLI KNOW THE PASSWORD FOR HIS COUSINS UNDERGROUND CITY

THE DWARVES FLED MORIA CENTURIES AGO AND THE PASSWORD HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN

AND WHY DOESN'T HE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE WHEREAS RANDOLF SEEMS TO KNOW FULL WELL

NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED BALIN WAS TRYING TO REESTABLISH A DWARVES KINGDOM AND THEY LOST CONTACT WITH HIS COLONY YEARS AGO GANDA DOESN'T KNOW EITHER BUT HE SUSPECTS
WHOOPS
I KNOW THIS DOESN'T REALLY FIT THE CRITERIUM OF A QUOTE BUT IT'S MY ALL TIME FAVORITE LITERARY PASSAGE NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I READ THE BOOKS I ALWAYS FEEL OVERWHELMED WITH EMOTIONS WHEN I REACH THIS PART

IN RODE THE LORD OF THE NAZGÛL A GREAT BLACK SHAPE AGAINST THE FIRES BEYOND HE LOOMED UP GROWN TO A VAST MENACE OF DESPAIR IN RODE THE LORD OF THE NAZGÛL UNDER THE ARCHWAY THAT NO ENEMY EVER YET HAD PASSED AND ALL FLED BEFORE HIS FACE


ALL SAVE ONE THERE WAITING SILENT AND STILL IN THE SPACE BEFORE THE GATE SAT GANDALF UPON SHADOWFAX SHADOWFAX WHO ALONE AMONG THE FREE HORSES OF THE EARTH ENDURED THE TERROR UNMOVING STEADFAST AS A GRAVEN IMAGE IN RATH DANEEN


YOU CANNOT ENTER HERE SAID GANDALF AND THE HUGE SHADOW HALTED GO BACK TO THE ABYSS PREPARED FOR YOU GO BACK FALL INTO THE NOTHINGNESS THAT AWAITS YOU AND YOUR MASTER GO
THE BLACK RIDER FLUNG BACK HIS HOOD AND BEHOLD HE HAD A KINGLY CROWN AND YET UPON NO HEAD VISIBLE WAS IT SET THE RED FIRES SHONE BETWEEN IT AND THE MANTLED SHOULDERS VAST AND DARK FROM A MOUTH UNSEEN THERE CAME A DEADLY LAUGHTER
OLD FOOL HE SAID OLD FOOL THIS IS MY HOUR DO YOU NOT KNOW DEATH WHEN YOU SEE IT DIE NOW AND CURSE IN VAIN AND WITH THAT HE LIFTED HIGH HIS SWORD AND FLAMES RAN DOWN THE BLADE


AND IN THAT VERY MOMENT AWAY BEHIND IN SOME COURTYARD OF THE CITY A COCK CROWED SHRILL AND CLEAR HE CROWED RECKING NOTHING OF WAR NOR OF WIZARDRY WELCOMING ONLY THE MORNING THAT IN THE SKY FAR ABOVE THE SHADOWS OF DEATH WAS COMING WITH THE DAWN
AND AS IF IN ANSWER THERE CAME FROM FAR AWAY ANOTHER NOTE HORNS HORNS HORNS IN DARK SIDES THEY DIMLY ECHOED GREAT HORNS OF THE NORTH WILDLY BLOWING ROHAN HAD COME AT LAST
NOT ALL THOSE WHO WANDER ARE LOST PROBABLY A COMMON CHOICE AND FOR GOOD REASON
HE KNEW THE DARK UNDER THE STARS WHEN IT WAS FEARLESS

SUDDENLY THE KING CRIED TO SNOWMAN AND THE HORSE SPRANG AWAY BEHIND HIM HIS BANNER BLEW IN THE WIND WHITE HORSE UPON A FIELD OF GREEN BUT HE OUTPACED IT AFTER HIM THUNDERED THE KNIGHTS OF HIS HOUSE BUT HE WAS EVER BEFORE THEM COMER RODE THERE THE WHITE HORSETAIL ON HIS HELM FLOATING IN HIS SPEED AND THE FRONT OF THE FIRST BORED ROARED LIKE A BREAKER FOAMING TO THE SHORE BUT THRODDEN COULD NOT BE OVERTAKEN FEY HE SEEMED FOR THE OF HIS FATHERS RAN LIKE NEW FIRE IN HIS VEINS AND HE WAS BORNE UP ON SNOWMAN LIKE A GOD OF OLD EVEN AS OROM THE GREAT IN THE BATTLE OF THE ALAR WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG HIS GOLDEN SHIELD WAS UNCOVERED AND LO IT SHONE LIKE AN IMAGE OF THE SUN AND THE GRASS FLAMED INTO GREEN ABOUT THE WHITE FEET OF HIS STEED FOR MORNING CAME MORNING AND A WIND FROM THE SEA AND THE DARKNESS WAS REMOVED AND THE HOSTS OF MORDOR WAILED AND TERROR TOOK THEM AND THEY FLED AND DIED AND THE HOOFS OF WRATH RODE OVER THEM AND THEN ALL THE HOST OF ROHAN BURST INTO SONG AND THEY SANG AS THEY SLEW FOR THE JOY OF BATTLE WAS ON THEM AND THE SOUND OF THEIR SINGING THAT WAS FAIR AND TERRIBLE CAME EVEN TO THE CITY
AT BILBO S FRONT DOOR THE OLD MAN BEGAN TO UNLOAD

FOR SOME REASON EVERY TIME I READ THAT LINE I IMAGINE GANDALF PULLING AN AK OUT FROM HIS HAT AND JUST GOING NUTS NO IDEA WHY JUST THIS SILLY THOUGHT I HAVE EVERY TIME I READ IT
CAN'T CHOOSE A FAVORITE THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT THIS ONE CAME TO MIND FIRST

I AM A SERVANT OF THE SECRET FIRE WIELDER OF THE FLAME OF ACOR YOU CANNOT PASSIVE THE DARK FIRE WILL NOT AVAIL YOU FLAME OF UNDEN
THE DESCRIPTION OF EYES

ONE FELT AS IF THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS WELL BEHIND THEM FILLED UP WITH AGES OF MEMORY AND LONG SLOW STEADY THINKING BUT THEIR SURFACE WAS SPARKLING WITH THE PRESENT LIKE SUN SHIMMERING ON THE OUTER LEAVES OF A VAST TREE OR ON THE RIPPLES OF A VERY DEEP LAKE I DON T KNOW BUT IT FELT AS IF SOMETHING THAT GREW IN THE GROUND ASLEEP YOU MIGHT SAY OR JUST FEELING ITSELF AS SOMETHING BETWEEN AND BETWEEN DEEP EARTH AND SKY HAD SUDDENLY WAKED UP AND WAS CONSIDERING YOU WITH THE SAME SLOW CARE THAT IT HAD GIVEN TO ITS OWN INSIDE AFFAIRS FOR ENDLESS YEARS
ONE THAT I LOVE FROM THE HOBBIT

AT LAST THEY CAME UP THE LONG ROAD AND REACHED THE VERY PASS WHERE THE GOBLINS HAD CAPTURED THEM BEFORE BUT THEY CAME TO THAT HIGH POINT AT MORNING AND LOOKING BACKWARDS THEY SAW A WHITE SUN SHINING OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED LANDS THERE FAR AWAY WAS THE LONELY MOUNTAIN ON THE EDGE OF EYESIGHT ON ITS HIGHEST PEAK SNOW YET UNMELTED WAS GLEAMING PALE SO COMES SNOW AFTER FIRE AND EVEN DRAGONS HAVE THEIR ENDING SAID BILBO AND HE TURNED HIS BACK ON HIS ADVENTURE
PRETTY MINOR BUT I LOVE IT I CAN JUST HEAR THE SOUNDTRACK SWELLING VALIANTLY AS THOUGHT IT WERE INCLUDED IN THE FILM

YES SAID ARAGON WE SHALL ALL NEED THE ENDURANCE OF DWARVES BUT COME WITH HOPE OR WITHOUT HOPE WE WILL FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF OUR ENEMIES AND WOE TO THEM IF WE PROVE THE SWIFTER WE WILL MAKE SUCH A CHASE AS SHALL BE ACCOUNTED A MARVEL AMONG THE THREE KINDREDS ELVES DWARVES AND MEN FORTH THE THREE HUNTERS
SARON WAS NEVER A MORTAL AS HE IS A MAIA MAIA HAVE THE INNATE ABILITY TO CHANGE FORMS BUT THE ACTIONS ONE TAKES IN THESE FORMS AND THE POWER EXPENDED THROUGH THEM BEGUN TO SHAPE IT THUS HE WAS EVENTUALLY ONLY ABLE TO TAKE A TERRIBLE AND EVIL FORM BHT HE APPEARED TO THE ELVES AS ANNATAR WHO WAS SAID TO BE VERY FAIR
LE GEM
LE FUCKING GEM


UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN THE ROB INGLIS ONE IS THE ONLY AUTHORIZED ONE THAT IS AVAILABLE
I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ONES ONE THAT READS IT ALL AND A DRAMATIZED VERSION BOTH ARE PRETTY ENJOYABLE
THE PHONOLOGY OF QUENDA WAS INFLUENCED BY FINNISH WITH SOME LATIN FOR PARTS OF THE GRAMMAR FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND

FOR SINDARIN IT WAS WELSH

THE DWARVES LANGUAGE KHUZDUL WAS INFLUENCED BY SEMITIC LANGUAGES BUT MOST OF THE DWARVES NAMES IN THE BOOK NORI BALIN FILI ETC AS WELL AS GANDALF ARE FROM A NORSE EDDA

THOSE NAMES ALONG WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE ROHIRRIM THAT WE SEE IN THE BOOK IS PART OF A TRANSLATION CONCEIT SINCE THE COMMON TONGUE HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO MODERN ENGLISH HE USED OTHER REAL LANGUAGES TO STAND IN FOR RELATED LANGUAGES ROHIRRIC IS REPRESENTED BY OLD ENGLISH FOR EXAMPLE ROHAN AS A WORD IS DERIVED FROM SINDARIN THOUGH AND ITS ORIGINAL FORM MEANING HORSE LAND WOULD HAVE BEEN DOCKHAND WHERE THE CH IS LIKE IN SCOTTISH LOCH

IN ONE OF THE HOME BOOKS WE HAVE A LIST OF A LOT OF THE INITIAL WORD ROOTS THAT HE WAS WORKING FROM AS AN EXPERT IN LANGUAGES BUT ALSO AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS DEVELOPING THE LANGUAGES BASED ON HIS OWN AESTHETIC PREFERENCES IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME THAT HE'D WORK FROM SIMPLE ROOTS AND ARRIVE AT SHORT WORDS THAT HAPPEN TO SOUND SIMILAR TO ONES IN OTHER LANGUAGES TOO IT WAS A CURIOSITY TO EVEN HIM WHEN A WORD THAT APPLIED TO NOUMENON AS THE DOWNFALLEN ATALANTA WOUND UP BEING SO CLOSE TO ATLANTIS I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT THERE ARE SO MANY MATCHES WITHIN ONE OTHER LANGUAGE THOUGH SO THANKS FOR POSTING
ALLEGEDLY THE ANCIENT EXTINCT LANGUAGE OF HURRIAN INSPIRED THE BLACK SPEECH OF MORDOR
FINNISH AND WELSH WERE BIG INFLUENCES ON THE ELVISH LANGUAGES HEBREW WHICH TZOLKIN HAD STUDIED ALONGSIDE GREEK AND LATIN IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL WAS AN INFLUENCE ON KHUZDUL THOUGH THE NAMES OF THE DWARVES WERE GERMANIC AND THE ROHHIRIC LANGUAGE WAS INFLUENCED BY ANGLO SAXON ANA OLD ENGLISH WHICH TZOLKIN TAUGHT
ABOUT ROHAN THERE WAS THE HOUSE OF ROHAN NOBLES FROM BRITTANY BRETAGNE IN FRANCE THE FOUNDER OF BRITTANY IS A CERTAIN CONAN MERIADOC INTERESTING WHEN YOU THINK OF THE LINK BETWEEN ROHAN AND MERRY BRANDYBUCK THE PEOPLE OF ROHAN THEMSELVES THEIR NAMES AND LANGUAGE ARE OBVIOUSLY ANGLO-SAXON THE RIDDERMARK FOR EXAMPLE AND FOR SOME REASON LANGSTRAND WHICH IS NOT IN ROHAN AT ALL
I LIKE THAT DEPICTION OF SARON IT'S UNIQUE I USUALLY SEE HIM DEPICTED AS EITHER A HANDSOME GUY OR WEARING A BUNCH OF BULKY POINTY ARMOUR WITH HIS FACE COVERED
CAN YOU LINK TO SOME OF RYAN HAYES OTHER WORKS THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL
VERY BEAUTIFUL WHY THE DOUBLE CHIN ON ARDA
RYAN EXPLAINS THE VISUAL STYLE OF SARON

SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO ILLUSTRATE ALL HIS VARIED STAGES WHICH I HAVE SPLIT INTO THREE MAIN ARCS MACRON ADRIANO AND SARON
WOW BEAUTIFUL
EPHAH I DON'T GET THE DOUBLE CHINS ALSO SARON LOOKS COOL BUT NOT HOW DESCRIBED
ID SAY BAUDRONS GHOST WANDERS MIDDLE-EARTH AND DOES MILDLY INCONVENIENT THINGS TO ANNOY PEOPLE LIKE TIPPING YOUR BEER MUG A BIT WHEN YOU DRINK SO YOU SPILL SOME AROUND YOUR MOUTH
REGARDING YOUR FIRST QUESTION I'M SURE I READ SOMEWHERE ONCE THAT TZOLKIN ALWAYS HATED HIS BOOKS BEING READ ALLEGORICALLY AND THAT IT WASN'T A PARALLEL TO THE RISE OF FASCISM NOR DENOUNCING THE EVILS OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IT WAS AN EFFORT TO CRAFT A NEW MYTHOLOGY
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE
I THINK HE GOES INTO MINDS AND TURN MEN MAD INTO TRAITORS AND COWARDS
EVEN THE SMALLEST SHELF CAN CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE FUTURE
THAT'S A LOT OF DAVID DAY YOU HAVE THERE
WHAT EDITION IS THAT FULL SET ON THE RIGHT AND WHERE DID YOU GET IT
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
WHICH EDITION OF LOAR IS THAT BETWEEN THE CHILDREN OF AURIN AND THE BTU RAYS I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THOSE FOREVER
NO HOBBIT BLUEJAYS I KNOW THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT I STILL ENJOYED THEM
NEEDS MORE BORED OF THE RINGS
NICE WHERE DID YOU GET THAT GANDALF STATUE
LIKE PALMWISE THE BRAVE
WHAT VERSION IS YOUR SILMARILLION I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A NICE HARDCOVER COPY
I WAS GOING TO CURSE BECAUSE OF NO SILMARILLION BUT I'M BLIND APPARENTLY
THE HARDBACK SET ON THE FAR RIGHT IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS
THE RING VERSE ITSELF IS FAIRLY EVIL I WOULD SUGGEST GETTING ANOTHER TZOLKIN QUOTE TATTOOED NOT ALL THOSE WHO WANDER ARE LOST IS A GOOD ONE OR ALL THAT IS GOLD DOES NOT GLITTER WHICH IS TAKE ON THE POPULAR PHRASE ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD

OR YOU COULD DO SOMETHING MORE OBSCURE LIKE AN EXCERPT FROM ONE OF THE SONGS HE WROTE FOR LOAR
THAT'S GREAT GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT

THE AUDIO BOOK IS NICE BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET HUNG UP WITH PRONOUNCING THE DIFFICULT WORDS WHICH CAN BE A EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHO IS STRONGLY INTERESTED
FUN
NEEEERDS S
THE EXECS AT WB DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE A GREAT INVESTMENT TO PAY FOR DOCUMENTARIES THAT PROBABLY WERE GOING TO DISCUSS HOW WB SCREWED UP THE HOBBIT I THINK IF ANYONE EVENTUALLY DOES THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE INDEPENDENTLY
THIS WHOLE SITUATION HAS MADE ME SO SAD

ALSO HOW DOES PETER JACKSON ASKING FOR ANYTHING NOT GET AN IMMEDIATE YES HIS FILMS MADE OVER BILLION IN BOX OFFICE ALONE AND MUCH MORE IN FRANCHISING

I'M BASICALLY JUST MY HEAD AT THIS POINT
HAVEN'T WARNER BROS FUCKED P OVER ENOUGH
I'M NOT GONNA BUY THE HOBBIT BUT I'M HOLDING OUT HOPE FOR A BHD LOAR RELEASE EVEN THOUGH THAT WOULD REQUIRE A LOT OF WORK THE CGI
FAN EDIT INCOMING THE POWERS THAT BE DEMAND IT

OR ELSE THERE WILL BE NO MORE SUNLIGHT
THEY LOWERED THE PRICE FROM TO STILL RIDICULOUS THOUGH
WE THINK HE MEANT DON'T JUST STAND THERE GAWPING YOU IDIOTS GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE

HE DID NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM MEAN HITCH A RIDE WITH THE EAGLES
I AM FLYING FROM DEADLY PERIL INTO DEADLY PERIL GANDALF

THEY ARE ONLY WAITING BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THEIR PURPOSE IS ALMOST ACCOMPLISHED AND THAT THE RING CANNOT FLY MUCH FURTHER GANDALF

FLY HE CALLED FLY GLORFINDEL

IT WAS ANSWERED AND TO THE DISMAY OF FRODO AND HIS FRIENDS OUT FROM THE TREES AND ROCKS AWAY ON THE LEFT FOUR OTHER RIDERS CAME FLYING TWO RODE TOWARDS FRODO NARRATOR

THE ELVES MAY FEAR THE DARK LORD AND THEY MAY FLY BEFORE HIM BUT NEVER AGAIN WILL THEY LISTEN GANDALF

BUT WHEN DARK THINGS COME FROM THE HOUSELESS HILLS OR CREEP FROM SUNLESS WOODS THEY FLY FROM US BOOMIER

GANDALF IS HERE FLY IF YOU VALUE YOUR FOUL SKIN I WILL SHRIVEL YOU FROM TAIL TO SNOUT IF YOU COME WITHIN THIS RING GANDALF

THE PASSAGE ON THIS SIDE PLUNGES STRAIGHT DOWN A STAIR IT PLAINLY DOES NOT LEAD BACK TOWARDS THE HALL BUT IT IS NO GOOD FLYING BLINDLY THIS WAY WITH THE PURSUIT JUST BEHIND ARAGON

THE COMPANY RETREATED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHAMBER BUT THEY HAD NO CHANCE TO FLY YET NARRATOR

GANDALF CAME FLYING DOWN THE STEPS AND FELL TO THE GROUND NARRATOR

EVEN AS ARAGON AND BOOMIER CAME FLYING BACK THE REST OF THE BRIDGE CRACKED AND FELL NARRATOR

SHE SEEMED TO BE LOOKING INSIDE ME AND ASKING ME WHAT I WOULD DO IF SHE GAVE ME THE CHANCE OF FLYING BACK HOME TO THE SHIRE SAM

THESE ARE JUST FROM FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK FLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH EAGLES HAVEN'T PAID ATTENTION TO WRITING STYLE


FLY IS AN OLDER WAY OF SAYING ESCAPE RUN NO
IT'S NOT REALLY AN INTERPRETABLE STATEMENT IT MEANS ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY RUN AWAY

PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT TZOLKIN LIKE TO PROPOUND THAT IT REFERENCES USING THE EAGLES BUT THIS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRABLY PROVEN WRONG TIME AND TIME AGAIN
FIGHT SCENE WITH THE BARONG SHOULD HAVE HAD THE DOOM THEME BLASTING IN THE BACKGROUND
HE ACTUALLY SAID FLY YOU FOOLS HE WAS ADVISING THEM ON WHAT TO WITH POTATOES
I'M STILL DEBATING WHETHER HE MEANT TO GET THE FUDGE OUT OF HERE OR TO GET A RIDE WITH THE EAGLES
I LOVE THE DWARF BOOKENDS LOL
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT THAT ABSOLUTELY SWEET BLACK LORD OF THE RINGS COPY ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SHELF

GODDAMN THAT'S A GREAT COLLECTION
CAN YOU PROVIDE A LINK TO THE BOOK ENDS THEY ARE PRETTY BA
WHICH BOOKS HAVE YOU READ I HAVE S SIMILAR COLLECTION BUT HAVE ONLY READ THE HOBBIT LOAR SILMARILLION AND UNFINISHED TALES PLANNING ON READING THE OTHER MIDDLE EARTH BOOKS
IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOKS BOOMIER IS FAR MORE NOBLE AND FLESHED OUT THAN IN THE MOVIES ALTHOUGH SEAN BEAN WAS A TERRIFIC CHOICE AND NAILED WHAT HE WAS GIVEN
ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES I THINK WAS THE WAY BOOMIER REACTED WHEN HE ATTACKED FRODO FOR TAKING AWAY THE RING

IN THE MOVIE HE SOUNDED INSINCERE WHEN HE SAID IT'S OK FRODO COME BACK I WON'T HURT YOU AS IF HE WAS JUST SAYING THAT TO GET THE RING BACK

BUT IN THE BOOK THERE'S INNER MONOLOGUE THE READER HEARS THOUGHTS AND CONFLICT HE REALIZES HIS ACTIONS WEREN'T HIS OWN KNOWS THE RING WAS MANIPULATING HIM AND HE REGRETS ATTACKING FRODO THAT DIDN'T REALLY MAKE IT INTO THE MOVIE
I AGREE BORIMIR IS A TRUE HERO EVEN THE GREATEST OF MEN CAN SUCCUMB TO THE POWER ON THE ONE RING
EVEN IN THE BOOKS THE READER LEARNS HOW BIG OF A DEAL BOOMIER WAS LONG AFTER HE DIED

PEOPLE IN CONDOR OFTEN REACT OH WOW YOU TRAVELED WITH THE BOOMIER HE'S A FREAKING LEGEND
SPEAK I DO AND ENTER INTO THE HOLY BONDS OF MATRIMONY MR MCKELLAN WAS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID TO THE HAPPY COUPLE AFTERWARDS KISS YOU FOOLS

YEAH I GUESS IT'S A GOOD THING HE DIDN'T
THAT'S SIR IAN MCKELLEN
I RESPECT THAT
AND NOW BY THE POWERS INVESTED IN ME BY NEW LINE CINEMA AND WINGCUT FILMS I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE
A MILLION LOAR THEMED WEDDING NOT QUITE GREAT GATSBY THEMED WEDDING LEVELS OF IRONY BUT STILL
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT'S CRAZIER WANTING TO HAVE GANDALF OFFICIATE YOUR WEDDING OR OFFERING SOMEONE A MILLION POUNDS TO BE GANDALF TO OFFICIATE YOUR WEDDING
ON ONE HAND I RESPECT THAT BUT ON THE OTHER JUST DO IT AND THEN DONATE THE MONEY TO A CHARITY OR SOMETHING OF THE LIKE
BY SPEAR WHAT A SAVINGS
THERE GOES MY DREAMS
FOOL OF A MCKELLEN
GOOD ON HIM ACTORS DON'T JUST EXIST TO CATER TO PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THEIR MOST POPULAR CHARACTER FROM YEARS BEFORE IT'S NOT LIKE IAN MCKELLEN IS GANDALF
IT MUST BE NICE TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE ONE CAN TURN DOWN M FOR A HALF A DAYS WORK TO BE DRESSED IN A COSTUME
THAT SUCKS MAN THAT BEEN SO AWESOME FOR THE PEOPLE GETTING MARRIED
I BET HE'D DO IT FOR MILLION I FOR ONE WOULD DO IT FOR FREE
IT'S PRETTY DEMORALIZING HAVING A DREAM YOU NEVER REALIZED YOU HAD PRESENTED TO YOU AND HAVING THAT DREAM CRUSHED SIMULTANEOUSLY
I WISH I COULD HAVE SEEN THE BILLIONAIRE TANTRUM WHEN HE COULD NOT GET HIS WAY
ALL I CAN PICTURE NOW IS SIR IAN MCKELLEN DOING IT ON A WHITE HORSE SHADOW MODEM
THAT IS JUST INSULTING OFFERING AN OLDER ACTOR TO SHOW UP DRESSED AS A WIZARD TO YOUR WEDDING HAVE ALL THE GUESTS LAUGH THEIR ASSES OFF REPEATEDLY ASKING HIM TO QUOTE FILM LINES I MEAN COME ON

EDIT DOWNVOTE ALL YOU WANT IT IS STILL INSULTING AND I'M PRETTY SURE HE DOESN'T NEED THE MONEY ASK RDF IF HE'D SHOW UP AT YOUR WEDDING DRESSED UP AS IRON MAN FOR MIL AND TRY TO GUESS WHAT HIS RESPONSE WOULD BE
SO I GUESS THE ANSWER TO THE BEATLES QUESTION WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF I SANG OUT OF TUNE IS BIND YOU WITH A MASSIVE CHAIN FOR A COUPLE OF AGES OF THE WORLD
LIKE HITLER DIDN'T GET INTO
NO IDEA WHEN 4TH GRADE IS IN THE NETHERLANDS WE HAVE A DIFFERENT SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT I THINK I READ THE LOAR BOOKS WHEN I WAS AROUND YEARS OLD I ONLY READ THE HOBBIT WHEN I WAS I THINK CHILDREN OF AURIN AND THE SILMARILLION WHEN I WAS
READ THE HOBBIT IN MAYBE 4TH OR 5TH GRADE COULDN'T GET INTO FELLOWSHIP UNTIL I TRIED AGAIN IN FRESHMAN YEAR OF HIGHSCHOOL

THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS STRESS TO NEW READERS THAT FOR BECOMES MORE INTERESTING AFTER THE FIRST HALF ON A FIRST READING
YES I READ THE HOBBIT IN GRADE OR AGE OR AND THEN LOAR WHEN I WAS MY FIRST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL AGE THIS WAS IN THE AND I AM PRETTY SURE I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN MY SCHOOL WHO READ IT
THE HOBBIT WHEN I WAS THE LOAR WHEN I WAS I DIDN'T REALIZE THE SILMARILLION EXISTED UNTIL I WAS

I HAD AN EARLY INTRODUCTION TO GREEK AND ROMAN MYTHOLOGY MY PARENT'S WELL-PLACED INSISTENCE THAT ALLOWED ME TO QUICKLY LOVE THE HOBBIT

SIDE NOTE I ALSO WROTE MY FIRST LOAR AT IT WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW INSPIRING THE BOOKS CAN BE FOR YOUNG MINDS
READ THE LOAR IN HIGH SCHOOL I THINK FRESHMAN YEAR SO ABOUT YEARS OLD
I READ THE HOBBIT AND LOAR IN 3RD GRADE SO I WAS OR
I TRIED READING LOAR IN 4TH GRADE I'M AND JUST READING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON I READ THE SILMARILLION AND UNFINISHED TALES LAST YEAR SO THAT WAS DEFINITELY A ACCOMPLISHMENT
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO READ THE SILMARILLION FOR THAT IT'S BASICALLY A HISTORY LESSON OF HOW EVERYTHING STARTED AND HOW EVERYTHING CAME TO BE

IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION PLAN WAS TO CREATE 2 RACES ELVES AND MEN ELVES WERE IN A WAY BEINGS MADE IN THE IMAGE OF THE ALAR MEN WERE FAVORITE CHILDREN HOWEVER HE GAVE THEM A GIFT MORTALITY THAT HE DID NOT GIVE THE ELVES THE PURPOSE OF THE GIFT WAS TO ALLOW MEN TO ENJOY THEIR LIVES MORE BECAUSE THEY WILL SOME DAY DIE THIS MEANT THAT IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS THEY PROVE TO BE THE BETTER RACE WHEN THEIR WORLD IS THREATENED BY THE LIKES OF SARON AND MELIOR IT IS THE FACT THAT THEY CAN LOSE EVERYTHING THAT DRIVES THEM TO FIGHT FOR THEIR FREEDOM ELVES ON THE OTHER HAND DON'T HAVE THIS SAME PASSION AS CAN BE SEEN FROM PARTS OF LORD OF THE RINGS THEY FEEL THEIR CONNECTION TO MIDDLE-EARTH FADING AND THAT IS WHY THEY SLOWLY DEPART THE LANDS AND GO TO ALIENOR

I CAN GO MORE ON THE PREMISE OF MEN BUT I DO NO JUSTICE WHEN IT COMES TO TZOLKIN
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO READ THE SILMARILLION IT EXPLAINS ALL OF THAT



ARDA IS THE NAME OF THE WORLD AND IS CALLED THE EARTH INTERCHANGEABLY ARDA CONSISTS OF AMAN THE CONTINENT WHERE ALIENOR IS LOCATED AND MIDDLE-EARTH THE LARGER CONTINENT WHERE EVERYTHING ELSE IS EA IS THE NAME OF THE UNIVERSE AND EXISTED BEFORE ARDA WAS CREATED

THERE WAS A LOT OF TIME BEFORE THE FIRST AGE TIME WASN'T MEASURED IN THE DAYS WHEN ONLY TIMELESS BEINGS WALKED THE EARTH

THE EXACT DETAILS ON THE CREATION OF MEN ISN'T EXACTLY SPELLED OUT IT'S TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ELVES DISCOVERING MEN BUT IT'S CLEAR THESE AREN'T THE FIRST OF THEM AND THEY'VE PROBABLY LIVED FOR A FEW GENERATIONS ALREADY THEY CAME FROM THE FAR EAST BEYOND LAND THAT HAD BEEN EXPLORED

THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE WORLD CHANGED A LOT BUT NOT QUITE LIKE PANGA OR ANYTHING THE ALAR RESHAPED THE WORLD DRASTICALLY IN THE VERY EARLY TIMES AND CATACLYSMIC EVENTS CHANGED GEOGRAPHY CONSIDERABLY LATER ON



YEAH SILMARILLION I THINK YOU'LL ENJOY IT IF YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT THIS STUFF THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL LEARN ALL ABOUT IT
THE FIRST AGE BEGAN WITH THE RISING OF THE SUN AND MEN AWOKE WITH THE RISING OF THE SUN THIS ALSO OCCURRED WHEN FINGOLFIN AND HIS PEOPLE MADE IT TO BELERIAND AS WELL MIDDLE-EARTH IS PART OF ARDA
AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THIS IS IN THE SILMARILLION IF YOU LIKE THE APPENDICES OF LOAR YOU MIGHT LIKE THAT BOOK AS WELL IT IS ABOUT THE HISTORY AND BACKGROUND OF MIDDLE-EARTH IT HAS THE ORIGIN STORIES OF ELVES MEN DWARVES ANTS EAGLES AND THE WORLD ITSELF

THE DAIN ARE JUST THE PEOPLE BELONGING TO THE THREE HOUSES OF MEN THAT WERE FRIENDLY TO THE ELVES DURING THE FIRST AGE THE HOUSE OF BAOR THE HOUSE OF DALETH THE HOUSE OF ADOR
IS THIS BY CHANCE INSPIRED BY YOSHIKAKA AMANO
THE COLORS ARE BEAUTIFUL ON THIS ONE
THE EAGLE'S FEATHERS LOOK GREAT
YOU HAVE AMAZING TALENT
HIS NAME IN UNDYING LANDS IS OLÓRIN
CAN I BE HOPEFUL THE IMAGE IS IRONIC
HAVE YOU POSTED THIS BEFORE I CAN SWEAR I'VE SEEN THIS EXACT IMAGE BEFORE FUCKING BADDER MEINHOF MAN
THIS IS COOL IS IT A CARD DESIGN OR SOMETHING
COMMISSION WHERE'S YOUR STORE
LOVE THE IMAGE

BUT WASN'T THE WISEST OF THE MAAR MELIAN

OK I'LL GO BACK TO MY EXTREME GEEK SOLITUDE NOW COOL WORK THOUGH
IN THE BOOK GANDALF AND THE MEET AFTER THE ENEMIES BREAK DOWN THE GATES OF MINAS TIGRISH AND BOTH ARE ON HORSEBACK

IN RODE THE LORD OF THE NAZGÛL A GREAT BLACK SHAPE AGAINST THE FIRES
BEYOND HE LOOMED UP GROWN TO A VAST MENACE OF DESPAIR IN RODE THE LORD OF
THE NAZGÛL UNDER THE ARCHWAY THAT NO ENEMY EVER YET HAD PASSED AND ALL FLED
BEFORE HIS FACE

ALL SAVE ONE THERE WAITING SILENT AND STILL IN THE SPACE BEFORE THE
GATE SAT GANDALF UPON SHADOWFAX SHADOWFAX WHO ALONE AMONG THE FREE HORSES OF
THE EARTH ENDURED THE TERROR UNMOVING STEADFAST AS A GRAVEN IMAGE IN RATH
DANEEN

YOU CANNOT ENTER HERE SAID GANDALF AND THE HUGE SHADOW HALTED GO
BACK TO THE ABYSS PREPARED FOR YOU GO BACK FALL INTO THE NOTHINGNESS THAT
AWAITS YOU AND YOUR MASTER GO

THE BLACK RIDER FLUNG BACK HIS HOOD AND BEHOLD HE HAD A KINGLY CROWN
AND YET UPON NO HEAD VISIBLE WAS IT SET THE RED FIRES SHONE BETWEEN IT AND
THE MANTLED SHOULDERS VAST AND DARK FROM A MOUTH UNSEEN THERE CAME A DEADLY
LAUGHTER

OLD FOOL HE SAID OLD FOOL THIS IS MY HOUR DO YOU NOT KNOW DEATH
WHEN YOU SEE IT DIE NOW AND CURSE IN VAIN AND WITH THAT HE LIFTED HIGH HIS
SWORD AND FLAMES RAN DOWN THE BLADE

GANDALF DID NOT MOVE AND IN THAT VERY MOMENT AWAY BEHIND IN SOME
COURTYARD OF THE CITY A COCK CROWED SHRILL AND CLEAR HE CROWED RECKING
NOTHING OF WIZARDRY OR WAR WELCOMING ONLY THE MORNING THAT IN THE SKY FAR
ABOVE THE SHADOWS OF DEATH WAS COMING WITH THE DAWN

AND AS IF IN ANSWER THERE CAME FROM FAR AWAY ANOTHER NOTE HORNS HORNS
HORNS IN DARK SIDES THEY DIMLY ECHOED GREAT HORNS OF THE NORTH
WILDLY BLOWING ROHAN HAD COME AT LAST

AFTER THAT THE LEFT THERE WAS NO CONFRONTATION IN THE BOOK AND STAFF WAS NOT BROKEN
SINCE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE BOOK THERE PROBABLY ISN'T A DEFINITIVE ANSWER
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT SCENE WAS MISLEADING THE WITCH KING MIGHT BE ABLE TO BEST GANDALF IN COMBAT BUT HE WOULD NEVER WIELD THE POWER TO DESTROY STAFF I EAST HIS TITLE AND POWERS
THE STAFF IS JUST A STICK
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL A HOLLYWOOD MOMENT
BECAUSE PETER JACKSON SAID SO I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY THAT SCENE WAS IN THERE
HERE IS THE THING ABOUT WORLD BUILDING IF YOUR GOAL IS TO BE LIKE TOKEN YOU'LL PROBABLY END UP DISAPPOINTING YOURSELF
I HAVEN'T BUT HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT

R WORDBUILDING
YES A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO USE IT FOR IF YOU MIND ME ASKING WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS WITH YOUR SECONDARY WORLD
THE REAL AWESOME PART OF THE REVIEW IS THE COMMENT BELOW IT

THANK YOU FOR PUTTING A WARM SMILE ON MY FACE I GUESS THERE TRULY IS SOME GOOD LEFT IN THIS WORLD AND IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR
WAS ELROD LIKE A FATHER TO ARAGON WOULDN'T THAT MAKE ARWEN HIS FOSTER SISTER
BECAUSE I WONDERED WHERE TO FIND THE ACTUAL PRODUCT
LINK

THAT DUDES LAST NAME LOOKS LIKE THE SOUND A SWORD WOULD MAKE
TOTALLY UNREADABLE ON MOBILE
THE REAL ANSWER IS THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE BOOK BILBO BEGINS TO FEEL HIS AGE BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT ACCELERATED AGING UNTIL THE RING IS DESTROYED THE SAME WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO GOLLUM
GOLLUM ALMOST ALWAYS HAD THE RING EVEN WHEN HE TRIED TO GO AROUND WITHOUT IT IT GNAWED AT HIS MIND BILBO USED IT FREQUENTLY BUT HE ONLY HAD IT FOR ABOUT YEARS OR SO BILBO WAS CLEARLY FEELING THE EFFECTS WORKING OUT IN HIM STRETCHED LIKE BUTTER OVER BREAD YET HE DID OUTLIVE OLD TOOK THE PROCESS OVERTOOK DIFFERENT PEOPLE AT DIFFERENT RATES
THAT'S MOVIE STUFF NOT BOOK STUFF SO YOU MIGHT FIND IT HARD TO ANSWER
YEAH I FEEL LIKE GOLLUM HAD SO MUCH OF A STRONGER CONNECTION WITH THE RING ALMOST AS IF HIS BODY WOULDN'T EVEN LET HIM PASS WITHOUT FINDING IT AGAIN AN ABSOLUTE YEARN IF YOU WILLIAM
SOME RANDOM HOBBIT IN THE END OF THE THIRD AGE ALL THE HEROS SAVE MIDDLE EARTH AND I'M CHILLAN IN THE SHIRE SMOKING DRINKING AND EATING
YOU WANT TO BE MORGOTH IN THE SECOND AND THIRD AGES

HOPE YOU ENJOY IMPOTENTLY FLOATING THROUGH NOWHERE FOR MILLENIA
MORGOTH IS GONE AFTER THE FIRST AGE THEY DECAPITATED HIM HOW YOU BREAKING THE RULES THAT FAST I'M ALREADY A DÚNADAN SO SIGN ME UP AS SOME RANDOM DÚNADAN OF THE THIRD AGE
I'D WANT TO BE A RANDOM ELF LIVING IN AMAN WITH A QT ELF F IN A COMFY PLACE
BOMBER NO QUESTION
TZOLKIN CLONES HAVEN'T BEEN THE NORM IN FANTASY FOR YEARS WITH THE UNFORTUNATE IN MANY SENSES OF THE WORD CASE OF ARAGON THE LAST WORK OF FANTASY THAT I WOULD CALL MAJOR THAT HEAVILY PULLED FROM TZOLKIN WAS THE EYE OF THE WORLD THE FIRST BOOK OF THE WHEEL OF TIME WAY BACK IN AND EVEN THAT'S A SPECIAL CASE BECAUSE ROBERT JORDAN CAREFULLY AND DELIBERATELY MODELED THE FIRST PART OF THE BOOK AFTER LOAR PRECISELY BECAUSE HE KNEW HE WAS DOING SOMETHING NEW HE WANTED TO START HIS READERS OFF ON FAMILIAR GROUND

ALL THE IMPORTANT WORKS OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS BOTH CRITICAL AND COMMERCIAL SUCCESSES HAVE WORKED HARD TO AVOID BEING TZOLKIN CLONES THERE'S INFLUENCE SURE BUT IT'S NOT AT ALL LIKE IT USED TO BE
IT'S NOT SURPRISING SINCE TZOLKIN PRETTY MUCH INVENTED THE MODERN FANTASY GENRE BY BORROWING THINGS FROM OLD EUROPEAN MYTHOLOGY LIKE TROLLS ELVES DWARVES MAGIC ETC ARAGON IS A FAIRLY GENERIC FANTASY I FIND THOUGH I STILL ENJOYED IT WHEREAS HARRY POTTER IS A BIT MORE UNIQUE I ACTUALLY THINK TZOLKIN WOULD HAVE ENJOYED STORIES LIKE HARRY POTTER BECAUSE OF THE HISTORICAL THEMES LATIN AND THE SHEER BRITISHNESS OF IT
PEOPLE ALSO EXAGGERATE INFLUENCE IN FANTASY HE HAS HAD A SLEW OF IMITATORS BUT THEY'VE BEEN MOSTLY SUPERFICIAL
FOR WOODEN CASES 2 ART PRINTS AND A NOTEBOOK LOL SUCK MY DICK WARNER BROS
WAS EXCITED UNTIL I SAW PRICE WTF AND APPARENTLY IT IS LACKING LOTS OF EXTRA FOOTAGE THAT PETER JACKSON HAS BEEN PROMISING FOR YEARS
MY EXTENDED EDITION DVD BOX SET LOOKS BETTER THAN THIS HAS NICER INTERIOR ARTWORK AND DOESN'T INCLUDE THE HOBBIT MOVIES SO IT'S ALREADY BETTER ON THREE COUNTS AND I'VE OWNED IT FOR YEARS
IF YOU TOLD ME I HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN WATCHING ALL THREE HOBBIT MOVIES AND PAYING TO NOT WATCH THEM I'D REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
ANY IDEA IF THE LOAR FILMS ARE STILL SPLIT BETWEEN 2 DISCS
THAT'S INSANE BUT IT ACTUALLY SHOWS HOW HOBBIT F DED UP BECAUSE OF THE MONEY DOLLAR SERIOUSLY
IS THIS PRICE SERIOUS
I WAS HOLDING OUT FOR A COLLECTION LIKE THIS I KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO DO IT BUT AT THIS PRICE I FEEL IT'S LIKE A HUGE SLAP IN THE FACE UNDENIABLY THIS HAS BEEN AIMED TOWARDS THE

YOU CAN BE A DIE HARD FAN BUT NOT HAVE MUCH MONEY BUT UNFORTUNATELY WB DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY

AND BECAUSE OF THIS IF THEY WONT BRING DOWN THE PRICE COULD THEY NOT JUST MAKE AN EXTENDED COLLECTION OF ALL FILMS BUT IN A REGULAR BTU RAY BOX LIKE MOST BOX SETS OUT THERE NOW

THE ENTIRE JAMES BOND COLLECTION IS ON AMAZON AND THAT'S FILMS IN A VERY TIDY LOOKING BOX

THERE IS NO EXCUSE TO HAVE IT AT THIS PRICE I'M SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO IT SINCE THE HOBBIT TRILOGY WAS ANNOUNCED I FEEL SHAFTED AS FUCK MADE A FOOL OF LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE I IMAGINE AS WELL

NOT FAIR I WILL NEVER BUY A SET OF FILMS THAT EXCEEDS THE PRICE OF A CAR IT'S A LUDICROUS PRICE

UGH I'M OUT
JUST RELEASE THE ARTBOOK SEPARATE THEN I DON'T HAVE TO BOTHER WITH ALL THE OTHER BULLSHIT LIKE AN OVERSIZED SHELF SOME ELABORATE COVERS AND THE HOBBIT MOVIES
PRICE IS NOW DOWN TO SO THAT'S BETTER RIGHT MAYBE NOT
NO THANKS I ONLY CARE ABOUT THE ULTIMATE EDITION THAT HAS BEEN SPECULATED BRING BACK THE LOST DELETED SCENES RESHOOT THE INTRO TO FOR WITH MARTIN FREEMAN
I DID SOME SLEUTHING AND FOUND THIS HETP IN CASE ANYONE IS INTERESTED IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEST OPTION AT THIS POINT
I DO BELIEVE THEY MADE ONE AT ONE POINT IN TIME TRY EBAY
HE FORGOT THE PASSWORD TO HIS GPS ACCOUNT

SARON WAS NEVER ABLE TO LOCATE THE RING AT ALL TIMES

UNLESS FRODO WAS WEARING IT SARON DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS
ALSO I FEEL IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT AT THE TIME OF THE EVENTS OF LOAR SARON HAD NO PHYSICAL FORM HE COULDN'T HOP ON A NAGUAL AND GO TO THEM BECAUSE HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE BODY TO DO SO THIS PAIRED WITH THE POINTS OTHERS HAVE ALREADY MADE MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO WHAT YOU DESCRIBED
SHAMMASH NAUR IS THE ONLY PLACE THE RING COULD BE UNMADE SHAMMASH NAUR IS NOT THE LAVA PITS OUTSIDE IT IS THE SPECIFIC LOCATION WHERE SARON BUILT THE FORGE WHERE HE CREATED THE RING
LOL I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY
DISCLAIMER I KNOW THE CORRECT LINE MY CHANGE IS INTENTIONAL

ORIGINAL GIF HTTPS CONTEXT FOR INSPIRATION
THAT'S SOME PRETTY GOOD COMPOSITING
HAVE AN UNVOTE
I WISH IT WAS MORE HINEY OR GLOWING AS IT SEEMS VERY MUTED AND MUNDANE

OTHERWISE SUPERB EDITING JOB
THIS THIS IS AWESOME
NICE WORK
I HAVE FUN WITH THE OC TAG HERE

HEY GUYS I HAVE THIS THING THAT IS TOTALLY ORIGINAL

OH YEAH WHAT IS IT

I THIS THING THAT SOMEONE ELSE DID A WHILE AGO

IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THOUGH I REALLY LIKE IT THE ONLY THING I MIGHT CHANGE IS GETTING RID OF REACTION AT THE END THERE I'M NOT SURE WHY

QUITE NIFTY MAYBE YOU COULD TRY YOUR HAND AT THE ANIMATED MOVIES AND GLEAN SOME GEMS FOR
AUTHORITY HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN TO YOU TO DENY THE RETURN OF THE KING STUART

I TRIED TO GET THIS PLATE BUT IT WAS TAKEN I LIVE IN TEXAS TOO
NICE A ARSENAL STICKER
I KNOW THAT STICKER ON THE LEFT NOT THE ARSENAL ONE
I GET CHILLS WHEN I LISTEN TO TZOLKIN READ THIS PART

HKMNHP T

UNFORTUNATELY I COULD NOT FIND A VIDEO OF EXCLUSIVELY THE INTENDED SELECTION BUT I ITS PLACE IN THIS VIDEO IF FOR SOME REASON THE IS NOT WORKING SKIP TO

FUN FACT THE CHARGE OF THE ROHIRRIM IS LOOSELY INSPIRED BY THE SIEGE OF VIENNA AND THE CHARGE OF THE POLISH CAVALRY LED BY THEIR KING SOBIESKI TO RELIEVE THE CITY FROM THE OTTOMAN ATTACK

THE OTTOMANS HAD OF COURSE CONQUERED CONSTANTINOPLE A FEW HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE AND MADE IT ISTANBUL AND HAD BEEN EXPANDING INTO EUROPE RELENTLESSLY QUITE SIMILAR TO MORDORE TAKING OVER MENAD ITHIEL INTO MINAS MOGUL AND OSGILIATH AS A CITY BUILT ON A RIVER AORTA ALSO BASED OFF THAT

AND ON A TOTAL TANGENT THE FACES IN THE WATER WERE LOSSES BASED OFF TZOLKIN AT THE SOMME SEEING DEAD BODIES EVERYWHERE IN THE MUD
THE RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM IS FAR AND AWAY THE MOST MOVING PASSAGE IN THE NOVEL WHICH I'M AWARE THAT MOST OF YOU HAVE READ A HUNDRED TIMES NO MOVIE CAN DO IT JUSTICE SO I ASK YOU TO READ IT AGAIN

SUDDENLY THE KING CRIED TO SNOWMAN AND THE HORSE SPRANG AWAY BEHIND HIM HIS BANNER BLEW IN THE WIND WHITE HORSE UPON A FIELD OF GREEN BUT HE OUTPACED IT AFTER HIM THUNDERED THE KNIGHTS OF HIS HOUSE BUT HE WAS EVER BEFORE THEM COMER RODE THERE THE WHITE HORSETAIL ON HIS HELM FLOATING IN HIS SPEED AND THE FRONT OF THE FIRST BORED ROARED LIKE A BREAKER FOAMING TO THE SHORE BUT THRODDEN COULD NOT BE OVERTAKEN FEY HE SEEMED FOR THE OF HIS FATHERS RAN LIKE NEW FIRE IN HIS VEINS AND HE WAS BORNE UP ON SNOWMAN LIKE A GOD OF OLD EVEN AS OROM THE GREAT IN THE BATTLE OF THE ALAR WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG HIS GOLDEN SHIELD WAS UNCOVERED AND LO IT SHONE LIKE AN IMAGE OF THE SUN AND THE GRASS FLAMED INTO GREEN ABOUT THE WHITE FEET OF HIS STEED FOR MORNING CAME MORNING AND A WIND FROM THE SEA AND THE DARKNESS WAS REMOVED AND THE HOSTS OF MORDOR WAILED AND TERROR TOOK THEM AND THEY FLED AND DIED AND THE HOOFS OF WRATH RODE OVER THEM AND THEN ALL THE HOST OF ROHAN BURST INTO SONG AND THEY SANG AS THEY SLEW FOR THE JOY OF BATTLE WAS ON THEM AND THE SOUND OF THEIR SINGING THAT WAS FAIR AND TERRIBLE CAME EVEN TO THE CITY
RIDE NOW I'VE WATCHED THIS PART SOME TIMES OVER THE YEARS IT MAKES WE WANT TO GET UP AND GO KICK SOME ASS CHOKES ME UP TOO
HOLDS EVEN MORE WEIGHT IN THE BOOK SEEING AS IT WAS THE ROHIRRIM THAT SAVED THE DAY RATHER THAN THE DEAD FROM DUNHARROW
IT GIVES ME CHILLS JUST BECAUSE OF THE SHEER NUMBER OF PEOPLE ALL RALLYING AROUND HIM EVEN THOUGH IT ALMOST SURELY MEANT THEIR DEATH
THE WAY HIS VOICE GOES UP AN OCTAVE ON THE LAST CRY OF DEATH GIVES ME CHILLS EVERY TIME
I LIKE WHAT THE FILM MAKERS HAD TO SAY ABOUT FILMING THAT EVENT WHERE ALL THE HORSES RUN ACROSS THE PLAIN APPARENTLY IT WAS EXTREMELY LOUD AND MAJESTIC
IN THE MOVIE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SO GRIM YET GLORIOUS THE ROHIRRIM STUFF THEIR FEAR OF DEATH DOWN BY ACCEPTING IT AND ATTEMPTING TO TAKE DOWN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THEY BEAT THE ORCS IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE OLIPHANT IT WOULD BE NICE IF ROHAN HAD SOME ARTILLERY TROOPS
IN THE BOOK IT IS NOT THRODDEN THAT CRIES DEATH BUT COMER IT HAS QUITE A BIT MORE IMPACT TOO AS COMER HAS MORE OR LESS GONE MAD IN THE MOMENT AFTER SEEING HIS UNCLE AND HIS SISTER DEAD OR PRESUMED DEAD
I'M A SYNTACTICIAN IN TRAINING ON MOBILE SO GIVE ME A BREAK WITH THE FORMATTING

CP NP ALL CLAUSE THAT VP IS NP GOLD TP DOES EGP NOT VP GLITTER

IN ALL THAT IS GOLD YOU HAVE A RELATIVE CLAUSE THAT IS PROBABLY SEMANTICALLY AMBIGUOUS I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT SOUNDS BAD I THINK THE MEANING IS CLEAR IN THE CONTEXT IN THEORY I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IT COULD BE INTERPRETED THE WAY YOU DO THAT EVERYTHING FOLLOWING THE VERB REFERS TO ALL GOLD BUT THAT WOULD BE IF A COMPUTER TRIED TO DECIPHER IT UNABLE TO THINK LIKE A HUMAN WOULD
I THINK THE ORIGINAL SOUNDS BETTER MORE ELOQUENT THOUGH MAYBE THE CONTRACTION YOU USED IS CLOUDING MY JUDGEMENT HERE MAYBE COMPARE IT TO NOT ALL THAT IS GOLD GLITTERS
IF ENGLISH IS ONE OF YOUR FIRST LANGUAGES I DON'T SEE WHAT CONFUSING ABOUT IT AT ALL
THE SINDARING VERSION HAS SOME ALTERNATE TRANSLATIONS
EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT BUT I WOULD ARGUE INSTEAD THAT IT SOUNDS GOOD AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED OUR HUMAN ABILITY TO USE CONTEXT ALLOWS US TO KNOW THE MEANING OF WHAT'S BEING SAID CONVEYING MEANING IS THE POINT OF LANGUAGE AND FINDING MORE INTERESTING WAYS TO DO SO THROUGH WRITTEN AND SPOKEN WORDS IS THE TRUE MARK OF A GIFTED POETIC
IT DOESN'T MEAN NOTHING THAT IS GOLD GLITTERS IT MEANS NOT EVERYTHING THAT IS GOLD GLITTERS

EX ALL CHILDREN DON'T LIKE STRAWBERRIES ACTUALLY MEANS NOT ALL CHILDREN DO LIKE STRAWBERRIES
IT'S THE FACT THAT THE RING HAS A CURSE ON IT THE ONE WHO TAKES IT MUST ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HOLDING IT THAT MAY MEAN BAD OR GOOD THINGS DEPENDING ON WHO HOLDS IT REMEMBER THAT WITHOUT GOLLUM THE RING MAY HAVE NEVER MADE IT TO THE VOLCANO
R FANTASY DID A FAVORITE FANTASY MOVIES POLL A WHILE BACK IT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST
JOHN FANTASY FILM EXCALIBUR

INTERESTINGLY BOORMAN PLANNED TO DO AN LOAR FILM BUT DUE TO SCRIPT REASONS EXCESSIVE DEVIATION FROM THE SOURCE MATERIAL AND THE ECONOMY THAT PROJECT NEVER GOT OFF THE GROUND
NOT FANTASY PER SE BUT RED SURE IT'S THE INTERNATIONAL SUPER EPIC BASED ON THE ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS NOVEL ERA IN CHINA REALLY PHENOMENAL FILM I THINK IT WAS ON NETFLIX AT ONE POINT
NOT A MOVIE BUT A TV SERIES YOU MIGHT ENJOY THE SHANKARA CHRONICLES HOWEVER IT'S A LOT MORE YOUNG ADULT AND IT CERTAINLY HAS THAT TV WRITING STYLE IT'S A BIT OF EYE CANDY TO BE HONEST NOT THAT NUTRITIOUS BUT ENTERTAINING TO WATCH
SEVERAL CENTURIES INTO THE FOURTH AGE THE DWARVES RECLAIMED MORIA LED BY IF MEMORY SERVES AURIN VII AND THERE THEY REMAINED UNTIL THEY EVENTUALLY FADED AWAY AS A PEOPLE
I HAVE THIS SAME ART HANGING NEAR THE DOOR OF MY HOUSE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WORK DONE BY A TALENTED PACIFIC NORTHWEST ARTIST NAMED ERIKA RAE HEINS

SHE HAS A LOT OF GREAT STUFF ON HER BETSY SITE
JUST LOAR OR THE HOBBIT AS WELL BEHORN
WELL THERE'S THE TWO BLUE INSTAR THAT TRAVELED FAR OFF INTO THE EASTERN

DAIN OF THE IRON HILLS LORD OF ERECTOR PLAYED A BIG ROLE IN HOLDING THE NORTHERN

ELADDAN AND ELROHIR BOTH PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES WHILE NOT HAVING MUCH TIME IN THE STORY

I'M NOT REALLY SURE IF THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE ASKING BUT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT I COULD THINK OF OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD
TREEBEARD IS IMPORTANT BUT NOT IN THE FELLOWSHIP THOUGH HE'S NOT OBSCURE
IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT CHECK OUT R TOLKIENFANS AS WELL THERE'S MORE DISCUSSION GOING ON THERE
PETER HOLLERS HAS BROUGHT SO MANY LOAR SONGS TO LIFE I LOVE THIS MUSIC HE ACTUALLY HAS AN ENTIRE ALBUM OF LOAR HOBBIT INSPIRED MUSIC FOR THOSE INTERESTED
HOW MANY VOICE TRACKS DID THIS TAKE U PETERHOLLENS IT SOUNDS AWESOME
I QUITE LIKED HIS VERSION OF THERE IS AN INN A MERRY OLD INN TOO BAD THEY ONLY USE PART OF LYRICS
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO A MINUTE OF THIS GUY PROMOTING HIMSELF AT THE END THIS SONG AND HIS WHOLE ALBUM OF TZOLKIN SONGS IS ON PONTIFY
DEPENDING ON HOW SKILLED YOU ARE THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE MEDLEY ARRANGED BY JARROD RADNICH THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE BLAST IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST FUN I'VE EVER HAD WITH A PIANO PIECE BE WARNED THOUGH IT'S ONLY FOR FAIRLY ADVANCED PLAYERS HERE IS A LINK TO THE SITE WHERE YOU CAN BUY HIS SHEETS

GREAT VIDEO SERIES BUT SOMETIMES THE MUSIC IS WAY TOO LOUD AND IF YOU COULD GET A BETTER MIC THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAYS
WHY WOULD YOU USE THE LUNG MAP AS A BASE OTHER THAN THAT GOOD VIDEO
WASN'T ILÚVATAR CON CENTO EN LA U
GOOD VIDEO BTW
NOBODY ELSE FINDING THE CONSTANT CHANGING OF VOICE PARTICULARLY FOR FEASOR REALLY DISTRACTING AND ODD
AWESOME VIDEO ARE THERE MORE LIKE THIS

EDIT NEVERMIND AUTOPHAGY SHOWED ME THE WAY
I WISH IT WOULD HAVE COVERED THE NEW SHADOW
CIVILIZATIONEX IS ONE OF THE BEST ON YT THE FIRST VIDEOS OF ARDA DONT HAVE THAT GOOD SOUND EDITING BUT THE LATER ONES ARE AMAZING THE DAGO DAGORATH VIDEO IS A MASTERPIECE
THANK YOU FOR POSTING ON OF THESE TYPES OF THINGS THAT DOESN'T HAVE A THOUSAND PAGES TO CLICK THROUGH AND JUST PROVIDES THE CONTENTION
AND CATE BLANCHETT HASN'T AGED A DAY
SEEMS OLD AGE HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH BILBO
WHAT HAPPENED TO FRODO
ROSE GOT MY KIND OF HOT
ISILDUR AND ROSE INCLUDED BUT NOT FRODO ARAGON OR GANDALF HALACHA
ROSIE COTTON TURNED INTO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON LITERALLY THEY GOT THE PICTURE OF ANOTHER PERSON
WE'VE MENTIONED THE LACK ON FRODO GANDALF AND ARAGON BUT NO MENTION OF PERGOLAS

CMON GUYS SHOW OUR WOODLAND PRINCE SOME LOVE
I THINK ROSE IS ANOTHER SARAH MCLEOD
THEY DIDN'T INCLUDE WOOD FRODO BECAUSE HE'S ACTUALLY AGING IN REVERSE
IND CHRISTOPHER LEE
LIV TYLER IS A TRUE ELF
WHY ONLY SOME OF THE CHARACTERS
THEY FORGOT SIR CHRISTOPHER LEE


JOHN JUST SHAVED THAT'S THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
THE MOVIES WERE SO IMPORTANT TO ME AS A CHILD I STILL CANT BELIEVE ITS BEEN OVER A DECADE SINCE THE LAST ONE
NO SAURURAN ACTUALLY I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR LOOKING AT A CORPSE
AMAZING LOOKS BEHIND SCENE
I STARTED THEM ALL LAST NIGHT SO GOOD TO BE BACK TO MIDDLE EARTH GOING TO NEW ZEALAND FOR CHRISTMAS I HOPE IT CHECK OUT HOBBITON AND ALL
HERE IS A MAP OF ARDA DURING THE SECOND AGE DRAWN BY KAREN WYNN FINSTAD BASED ON OWN DRAWINGS AND DESCRIPTIONS LORD OF THE RINGS TAKES PLACE DURING THE THIRD AGE WHICH TAKES PLACE AFTER THE DROWNING OF NOUMENON SO NOUMENON AMAN AND MAYBE THE WALLS OF THE SUN PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE THERE ANYMORE BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WOULD LIKELY BE MOSTLY THE SAME
POKEMON FLY YOU FOOLS
I AM FIRE I AM DEATH I AM SITTING ON INFINITE GREAT BALLS AND I SMELL YOU CAMPING MY POKESTOP THIEF
DID GIMLI GO ALL THE WAY TO AMAN OR JUST TOL EGRESSED DID HE MEET AUL
INTERESTING THOUGHT BUD I ALWAYS ASSUMED HE'D CHILL IN THE HALLS OF WAITING WITH ALL THE DECEASED DWARVES AT LEAST ONCE IN A WHILE
I AORTA THINK GIMLI WOULD BE EVEN MORE SPEED AT SUCH A MEETING
I DOUBT AUL PAYED ANY HEED TO DEEDS THERE IS ALSO NO REAL REASON FOR AUL TO BE STOKED I MEAN DEEDS WERE VALIANT BUT THEY WERE NOT THAT GREAT IN COMPARISON TO SOME OF THE DEEDS OF OTHER DWARVES IN THE YEARS LONG SINCE PAST
THEN FRODO COMES BACK AND EVERYTHING IS ALL FUCKED UP HE MUST HAVE BEEN SALTY AF
FOURTH PARAGRAPH IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS

BUT SO FAR TROUBLE HAD NOT COME AND AS MR BAGGIES WAS GENEROUS WITH HIS MONEY MOST PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO FORGIVE HIM HIS ODDITIES AND HIS GOOD FORTUNE HE REMAINED ON VISITING TERMS WITH HIS RELATIVES EXCEPT OF COURSE THE AND HE HAD MANY DEVOTED ADMIRERS AMONG THE HOBBITS OF POOR AND UNIMPORTANT FAMILIES BUT HE HAD NO CLOSE FRIENDS UNTIL SOME OF HIS YOUNGER COUSINS BEGAN TO GROW UP
WHO MADE THIS THE BOOKS ARE LOVELY
THIS ARTIST ALSO GOES BY HOBS SHE HAS SOME REALLY AMAZING STUFF FLOATING AROUND
THE ADVENTURES OF YOUNG GALADRIEL WOULD MAKE AN AWESOME STORY
ARE YOU CERTAIN IT'S NOT BELLE AND GASTON
MOST TZOLKIN BASED ART IS VERY HIGH FANTASY AND GRIM WHICH I LOVE HOWEVER THIS CUTESY PICTURE IS GREAT I LOVE IT
THIS IS ADORABLE
WHY WOULD A VALA NEED TO LEARN ANYTHING FROM AN ELF
ARTIST GOES BY THE NAME OF HOBS
I SIMPLY MUST SEE MORE OF THIS KIND OF WORK
THE GAME OF THRONES CONNOTATIONS DISTURB ME
THIS IS PRETTY DAMN IMPRESSIVE
