TICKETS WILL GO ON SALE IN THE U SOUTH ON MONDAY NOVEMBER AT AM EST

ROGUE ONE DISNEY HOLIDAY CELEBRATION EXCLUSIVE LOOK
GOT TICKETS FOR MY FIRST SHOWINGS CAN'T WAIT
I MANAGED TO WRANGLE SOME TICKETS FOR PM ON THURSDAY THE BEFORE FANDANGO IMPLEMENTED THE WAITING ROOM THE TOTAL WAS FOR FOUR TICKETS I WAS SWEATING SO BAD THAT I DIDN'T STOP TO CONSIDER HOW OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPRICED IT WAS JUST KEPT NODDING MY HEAD YES WHILE SLAMMING MY LIMP FINGERS ON MY KEYBOARD

TURNS OUT THE TICKETS COST A POP BECAUSE THEY ARE TICKETS FOR FANDANGO WAS CRASHING SO I WASN'T BEING PICKY ABOUT WHAT THEATER I BOUGHT TICKETS FOR AS LONG AS IT WOULD LET ME THROUGH TO THE PURCHASING SCREEN

LUCKILY I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS TRANSACTION WENT THROUGH BECAUSE IT APPEARED TO CRASH SO I WENT ON TO BUY FOUR MORE TICKETS FOR A REGULAR 3D SHOWING AT THE SAME THEATRE

NOW I HAVE TICKETS FOUR FOR WITH RESERVED SEATING AND PRETTY GREAT SEATS AND FOUR FOR A GENERAL ADMISSION 3D SHOWING OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO RETURN FOUR OF THEM AND MAKE SOME PEOPLE'S DAY WHEN THEY DISCOVER THEM AVAILABLE ON FANDANGO BUT I'M TORN ON WHICH TICKETS TO RETURN

HAS ANYONE SEEN A MOVIE IT SOUNDS REALLY GIMMICKY AND ANNOYING MIGHT BE FUN FOR A SECOND VIEWING BUT WON'T IT DETRACT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF SEEING THE NEW STAR WARS THEN AGAIN THE SEATS ARE GREAT AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO ARRIVE TWO HOURS EARLY TO GET IN LINE

IF YOU'VE SEEN A MOVIE DID IT ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE OR DETRACT FROM IT I LIKE 3D JUST FINE BUT RARELY FEEL THAT IT ENHANCES THE EXPERIENCE I'M JUST NEUTRAL ABOUT IT IF IS THE SAME I'M DOWN BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE FEELING NEUTRAL ABOUT BEING SPRAYED WITH WATER HIT WITH GUSTS OF WIND AND POKED IN THE BACK BY A TEMPERAMENTAL SEAT MASSAGER WHILE TRYING TO WATCH A MOVIE I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO FOR MORE THAN A YEAR

THOUGHTS
WAS JUST THINKING TONIGHT THIS COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SEE AND ALONG WITH CAPTAIN ANTILLES HAVE THERE BEEN ANY RUMORS ABOUT THAT
DOES ROGUE ONE HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ROGUE SQUADRON WILL THEY MAKE AN APPEARANCE
ANYONE ELSE THINK VADER WILL HAVE A TAD BIT MORE THAN JUST A CAMEO I'M THINKING A SCENE WHERE HE JUST DOMINATES SOMEONE SOMETHING MAYBE A FIGHT SCENE WITH A REBEL BADASS
IT'S WORTH SEARCHING OUT FOR IMAX 2D FOR THIS IN THE THEATER
MEGA HYPE FOR THIS MOVIE SO GLAD I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP MY TICKETS YESTERDAY FOR MY LOCAL CINEMA THIS IS GOING TO BE MY GIRLFRIENDS 2ND STAR WARS FILM SO I'M TRYING TO FORCE HER TO SEE THE ORIGINALLY TRILOGY BEFOREHAND
HELLO WILL SOMEONE THAT HASN'T SEEN ANY PREVIOUS SW FILMS UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE I'M WONDERING IF A SW MARATHON IS NECESSARY BEFORE DECEMBER FOR MY FRIEND THAT HASN'T SEEN ANY OF THE FILMS OR IF I CAN TAKE HER TO THIS MOVIE AND THEN RECATCH THE OTHER THANK YOU

I'M SO STOKED FOR THIS MOVIE IT LOOKS GREAT AND IF IT IS THE HIT WE ALL WANT IT TO BE WILL ESSENTIALLY LAUNCH THE STAR WARS EXTENDED UNIVERSE TO SCREEN THERE ARE TONS OF STORIES TO TELL OUTSIDE OF THE SKYWALKER TRILOGIES
3D OR NON 3D
WHEN DO PEOPLE THINK THE REVIEW EMBARGO WILL LIFT
I'M SURE I'M NOT THE FIRST TO MENTION THIS BUT WHILE THE WORLD WITH THE LOOKS LIKE LEMON IT ALSO REMINDS ME OF THE BIKINI ATOLL ISLANDS WHERE AMERICA FIRST TESTED THE ATOM BOMB

NOT SURE IF THE FORMER IS INTENTIONAL BUT I'M CERTAIN THE LATTER IS
HELLO I AM A LITTLE HYPED
I HONESTLY THINK THAT I'M GOING TO LIKE ROGUE ONE MORE THAN FORCE AWAKENS BUT I'M NOT NEARLY AS EXCITED FOR ROGUE ONE AS I WAS FOR FORCE AWAKENS I THINK LAST YEAR I WAS JUST EXCITED FOR STAR WARS TO COME BACK IT WAS A TOTAL MYSTERY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE IT IT FELT LIKE THEY HAD ALL THIS AWESOME FREEDOM THAT THEY COULD DO SO MUCH COOL NEW STUFF WITH THEN THEY DIDN'T REALLY DO MUCH NEW STUFF AT ALL KALO REN WAS A COOL NEW CHARACTER I LIKE CHARACTER TOO BECAUSE IT'S A FRESH CONCEPT TO HAVE A STORM-TROOPER WITH A CONSCIENCE THAT DEFECTS ON THE WHOLE THOUGH IT WAS REALLY REALLY SAFE AND IMO DIDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE I'M A BIG FAN THAT DIDN'T NEED TO HAVE MY FAITH IN STAR WARS RESTORED THOUGH ANYWAY COMING OFF FORCE AWAKENS I JUST CAN'T GET SUPER EXCITED ABOUT ROGUE ONE WE KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT WE KNOW HOW IT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO END WE'LL PROBABLY GET ATTACHED TO SOME CHARACTERS AND WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM AS WE'RE WATCHING IT BUT AGAIN WE KNOW WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY HAPPEN I DO THINK IT WILL BE A MORE FUN MOVIE THEN FORCE AWAKENS THOUGH BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE A FRESH PERSPECTIVE AND DIFFERENT TYPE OF STORY I KEEP GOING BACK AND FORTH I'M EXCITED ON PAPER BUT DON'T FEEL IT IN MY GUT

EDIT GOT THEM CENTER ROW TICKETS ON THURSDAY THE
JUST PURCHASED TWO AIX ON THE SHOWCASE CINEMA APP FOR THURS IN FARMINGDALE THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FLUKE BUT GOT A RECIPE IN MY EMAIL JUST NOW GET ON THAT THIS IS NOT A DRILL
LESS THAN AN HOUR LOCK IN ATTACK POSITION
JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT TICKETS IN CANADA CINEPLEX WILL GO ON SALE AT MIDNIGHT AS WELL
THE THEATER THAT I WANT TO GO TO DOESN'T HAVE THEM ON SALE YET ADVICE
JUST GETTING MY TICKETS NOW WENT TO THE MIDNIGHT SCREENING FOR FFA BUT WILL PROBABLY JUST GO FRIDAY EVENING FOR ROGUE ONE

WHILE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT THE EXCITEMENT I FELT FOR FFA WAS ANOTHER LEVEL I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO IT I SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS ON THIS SUBREDDIT AND ALL THE MOVIES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS I WATCHED EVERY TRAILER AND EVERY ANALYSIS ON THE TRAILERS

FOR ROGUE ONE I'VE ALREADY STOPPED WATCHING THE TRAILERS THOUGH I FEEL LIKE I KNOW PLENTY AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY IT RATHER THEN KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
JUST GOT MY TICKETS TO A MIDNIGHT SCREENING FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ON TIME TO GET GOOD SEATS SO EXCITED NOW THE LONG WAIT BEGINS
IT'S PROBABLY IN HERE SOMEWHERE BUT WHAT TIME DO TICKETS GO ON SALE I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING THAT SAID THEY GO ON SALE ON THE WEST COAST MUCH LATER TONIGHT
DELETED
WRONG LOGO IT IS THE REBEL LOGO
RANDOM UNLIKELY THOUGHT ANYBODY ELSE THINK IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF KRENNIC HAD THE DARKSABER FROM ACW AS HIS PERSONAL WEAPON IN ADDITION TO OR INSTEAD OF A PERSONAL SIDEARM

I KNOW THE DARKSABER IS LIKELY IN POSSESSION AT THAT POINT IN THE STAR WARS TIMELINE BUT WITH KRENNIC AS HEAD OF ADVANCED WEAPONS RESEARCH IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH OF A STRETCH TO SEE HIM HAVING IT AS PART OF HIS STUDY WITH GYBER CRYSTALS AND OTHER SUCH RELATED SYSTEMS THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF INTERESTING VOODOO TO BE FOUND IN ANCIENT JEDI SITH RELICS LIKE THAT FROM A SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE

WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO SEE HIM ON THE VERGE OF DEFEAT ONLY TO WHIP OUT SOMETHING AWESOME AND SPECIALIZED LIKE THAT AS A FINAL LINE OF DEFENSE
I KNOW DIRECTIONS IN SPACE ARE RELATIVE BUT DOES SEEING THE DEATH STAR UPSIDE DOWN IN THE MOST RECENT TV SPOTS AND NISSAN COMMERCIALS IRK ANYONE ELSE
MIGHT BE AN UNPOPULAR OPINION BUT I HOPE WE SEE A SMALL TIE IN TO THE OT I THINK IT WOULD BE COOL TO HAVE A SHOT OF ONE OF THE INFILTRATORS IN A CELL AND MAYBE SEE HAN AND LUKE WALK BY
NEW TRAILER THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO BE AWARE OF
ROGUE ONE A STAR WARS STORY TRUST
I'M NOT THERE ON OPENING NIGHT HERE IN THE U KING I'M ACTUALLY SEEING IT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT THE MIDNIGHT SHOWINGS IN THE US ARE ON
EVERY TIME I SEE A NEW TRAILER OR TEASER FOR THIS I GET SO EXCITED I LITERALLY HAVE TEARS OF JOY DOES THAT MAKE ME A STAR WARS NERD
MY BROTHER GOT ME AND MY FAMILY TICKETS TO GO SEE ROUGE ONE
I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE KRENNIC ON SCREEN I'M NOT FINISHED WITH CATALYST YET BUT ITS PAINTING HIM AS SUCH A CALCULATED MANIPULATIVE HATABLE VILLAIN
ARE PEOPLE PISSED OFF ABOUT THE EXCLUSION OF THE TITLE CRAWL I THINK I MISSED THE POST HERE WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED BUT THE PODCAST I LISTEN TO WERE ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS ABOUT IT THEY SAID IT WAS A MASSIVE MISTAKE AND ANYONE WHO SAID OTHERWISE WAS PLAIN WRONG AM I THE ONLY ONE REALLY EXCITED THAT THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING UNIQUE WITH THE OPENING
I AM GREATLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FILM FINALLY THE CHANCE TO SEE THE SW UNIVERSE OUTSIDE OF THE SKYWALKER SAGA SORT OF I GUESS ON SCREEN THAT IS

I HAVE A FEW THEORIES

I FEEL OUR PROTAGONIST WILL TURN TO THE DARKSIDE I FEEL EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM IS ROGUE INCLUDING HER ALLEGIANCES TO BOTH SIDES

I DONT WANT A CLIFFHANGER I WANT THE GRITTY CONCLUSION AT THE END SUCCESS IS THE HAPPY ENDING
DOES ANYONE ELSE THINKS THIS LOOKS LIKE A CLICHE MOVIE THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE STAR WARS IN IT THE STYLE OF THESE TRAILERS MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A TYPICAL MOVIE WITH A VERY STANDARDIZED FORMULA AND IT WORRIES ME
YOU KNOW I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING

THEY INTERCEPTED A CODED IMPERIAL TRANSMISSION BUT HAD NO PROBLEM FINDING OUT WHAT IT SAID A MOVIE ABOUT REBEL CRYPTOGRAPHERS BREAKING THE IMPERIAL ENIGMA CODE MAYBE
IF VADER KILLS KRENNIC AND OR KILLS MOST OF THE REBELS I WILL BE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED KRENNIC IS THE MAIN VILLAIN AND SO SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE THE MAIN VILLAIN IT SEEMS LIKE DISNEY IS JUST TRYING TO APPEASE THE FANS WHO ARE MORE INTERESTED IN NOSTALGIA RATHER THAN ACTUAL STORYTELLING
SIR THE POSSIBILITY OF ROGUE ONE SUCCESSFULLY BEATING FFA AT THE BOX OFFICE IS APPROXIMATELY TO
NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS
NOT FEELING THE EXCITEMENT THAT I FELT FOR FORCE AWAKENS BUT IM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M NOT AS INVESTED MIGHT BE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THEY COULDN'T PULL ANY REAL TWISTS OR SURPRISES WHEN WE PRETTY MUCH KNOW THE ENDING BUT IM SURE IT'LL BE FUN TO WATCH
WAITING FOR TICKETS IS GIVING ME SO MUCH ANXIETY I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT I'LL GET A CHANCE TO WATCH IT OPENING NIGHT ALREADY
WILL THERE BE CATALYST BOOK DISCUSSION
ALL I WANT IS A REBELS REFERENCE LIKE GHOST FLYING BY
LOOKS LIKE I HAVE TO GO MEDIA SILENCE FOR COUPLE DAYS TO AVOID ANY SPOILERS RELEASE DATE IS AND MY MILITARY SERVICE ENDS AT LEAST IT'S GONNA BE SICK WEEK MANDATORY MILITARY SERVICE ENDS AND NEW STAR WARS MOVIE PERFECT
WHY CAN'T WE BUY TICKETS YET I'M JUST TOO EXCITED

DISNEY PLS
I STILL JUST WANT THE PLANS TO BE STOLEN WITH MINUTES LEFT IN THE MOVIE AND A DARTH VADER KILLING SPREE FOR THE LAST MAKE IT DEVASTATING AS IT SHOULD BE
ORDERED MY TICKETS FOR THE OUR LOCAL CINEMA HAS A 7TH SCREEN WITH WAITER SERVICE AND SOFAS INSTEAD OF SEATS I'VE BOOKED 2 SOFAS FOR MYSELF MY WIFE AND OUR TWO DAUGHTERS MASSIVE EXCITEMENT IN THE PHILLIEJOE HOUSEHOLD
THIS IS MY VERSION OF THE LAST SHOT OF THE MOVIE NOUN B IN THIS VERSION THE STAR WARS INTRO FANFARE IS NOT USED IN FULL FORCE IN THE MOVIE



AFTER THE PLANS ARE ON BOARD THE TACTIVE IV IT MAKES THE JUMP TO HYPERSPACE WITH THE DEVASTATOR JUMPING RIGHT AFTER IT

SCREEN IRISES TO BLACK AND THEN THE STAR WARS THEME BLARES AS THE CREDIT ROLLS TIES IT TO THE BEGINNING OF ANH

ACCORDING TO RUMORS THE MOVIE WILL END RIGHT BEFORE ANH STARTS WILL WE GET TO SEE THE TACTIVE IV CREW AND PROBABLY LEIA TOO
HOPING THE TICKETS ARE RELEASED TOMORROW EVENING AFTER THE ABC SPECIAL
JUST A REMINDER IN CASE IT HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP YET THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOME KIND OF EXCLUSIVE LOOK ON ABC TONIGHT I'M CURIOUS WHAT EXACTLY WE'LL GET ESPECIALLY WITH THE RECENT DELUGE OF TEASERS TV SPOTS BUT HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE SOMETHING COOL

ABCNETWORK STATUS TWSRC
I THINK WANT ALL OF THEM TO DIE BY THE END I FEEL LIKE HAVING ANY OF THEM STILL BE AROUND AT THE END WOULD DIMINISH WHAT THEY DID
THE CHANGE IN DELIVERY OF THE I REBEL LINE SOUNDS FANTASTIC IT'S ONLY A SMALL ISSUE I HAD AMONGST ALL MY EXCITEMENT BUT I'M GLAD IT SOUNDS LESS CHEESY
I THINK SAW IS TOAST THAT LOOKED AND SOUNDED LIKE A PARTING CALL SAVE THE REBELLION SAVE THE DREAM AND THEN HE TURNS AND BLASTS THE CRAP OUT OF SOME EMPIRE WHILE THE REST OF THE TEAM ESCAPES
THE BEGINNING SCENE WILL PROBABLY BE AT TERPEN INDUSTRIES BY THE WAY KRENNIC IS SUSPICIOUS AS HELL
HYPE
GGIGIMMMMMEEEEEI ITTTT NOWOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
JUST CHECKED NOW ON THE FANDANGO APP AND IT SAID TICKETS WILL GO ON SALE AT AM EASTERN TIME ON MONDAY THE
TICKETS STILL AREN'T ON SALE HERE IN CANADA
I DONT THINK I HAVE ANY THEORIES I JUST KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS IM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING AFTER READING CATALYST

HOW DID KRENNICK CATCH UP TO THE EROS
2 WHAT ROLE DOES LARKIN PLAY AT FINALLY BRINGING DOWN KRENNICK
HOW BIG IS THE CRYSTAL IN THE DEATH STAR

MY BIGGEST QUESTION NOW IS STILL WHAT MY BIGGEST QUESTION WAS AFTER THE FIRST TEASER WHO THE HELL IS IN THE GIANT ACTA TANK THERE'S NOT AS MUCH MYSTERY AROUND THIS FILM AS THERE WAS IN FFA NOT AS MUCH RIDING ON THE CREATIVE DECISIONS MADE OR MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS EITHER WE'RE ESSENTIALLY JUST ALONG FOR THE RIDE
TICKETS GO ON SALE MONDAY THE
WATCHED MINUTES HERE ON MEXICO THE VISUALS ARE AMAZING THE ACTION IS WELL DIRECTED AND THE CHEMICAL BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS LOOKS VERY NICE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MORE

SPOILERS S THEY KIND THAT INTRODUCED US TO ALL THE CHARACTERS BUT I HAVE NO IDEA IF THE SCENES WERE EDITED OR NOT IS THE COMIC RELIEF BUT A BADASS ONE LIKE A MIXTURE BETWEEN GROOT AND THERE'S A FLASHBACK I THINK IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT IT HAPPENED ON STAR WARS THERE'S A LOT OF LOCATIONS IN THE MOVIE LIKE OR IN THE SCENES SHOWED
ON THE 2D IMAX WOO AND HOO SPRING TO MIND
SUPER HYPED

QUESTION FOR ALL THOUGH KEEP THINKING I MIGHT MAKE IT A THREAD OF ITS OWN BUT I SUPPOSE THIS IS AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY TO ASK
IS ANYONE ELSE EVEN A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT CONTINUITY BETWEEN THIS AND THE ORIGINAL STORY
I FIND AS THE DAYS GO BY I'M BECOMING ALMOST HESITANT AS EXCITED AS I AM I FEEL LIKE PERHAPS THE EXPECTATIONS I'M HEAPING ONTO THIS FILM ARE TOO BIG STAR WARS A NEW HOPE IS MY SINGLE FAVOURITE MOVIE OR STORY OR EVEN JUST PIECE OF FICTION OF ALL TIME I'VE SEEN IT WELL OVER TIMES I LOVE AND ADORE IT BUT I'M BECOMING SO WORRIED OVER THE TINIEST POTENTIAL THAT ROGUE ONE DOESN'T SYNC UP AND I DON'T EVEN THINK I MEAN THE WHOLE FILM MAYBE JUST THE OPENING CRAWL

IT IS A PERIOD OF CIVIL WAR REBEL SPACESHIPS STRIKING FROM A HIDDEN BASE HAVE WON THEIR FIRST VICTORY AGAINST THE EVIL GALACTIC EMPIRE

DURING THE BATTLE REBEL SPIES MANAGED TO STEAL SECRET PLANS TO THE EMPIRE'S ULTIMATE WEAPON THE DEATH STAR AN ARMORED SPACE STATION WITH ENOUGH POWER TO DESTROY AN ENTIRE PLANET

PURSUED BY THE EMPIRE'S SINISTER AGENTS PRINCESS LEIA RACES HOME ABOARD HER STARSHIP CUSTODIAN OF THE STOLEN PLANS THAT CAN SAVE HER PEOPLE AND RESTORE FREEDOM TO THE GALAXY

AND THAT'S ALL IT HAS TO SYNC UP TO LESS IN FACT AS THE THIRD PARAGRAPH APPLIES TO IV AND NOT RO
I RECOGNISE THAT THAT POTENTIAL IS VERY SMALL BUT IT STILL BOTHERS ME I ALREADY HAVE AN ISSUE SLIGHT THOUGH IT MAY BE WITH REBELS ENTIRE CONCEPT EXISTENCE CREATING AN INCONSISTENCY WITH THAT CRAWL OF I'M SURE IT'S ALL A LOT OF SEMANTICS BUY I FEEL LIKE ANY VICTORY FOR THE GOOD GUYS ESPECIALLY ONE ACHIEVED THROUGH STARFIGHTERS DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS
BUT ROGUE ONE IS OF SUCH BROADER SCOPE IS SO MUCH BIGGER

ANYONE ELSE GETTING THAT SENSE OF I'M NOT SURE THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT TREPIDATION
OK I'M HAPPY TO SEE ROGUE ONE BUT I'M NOT BUYING A GODDAMN NISSAN WTF DISNEY
I HAVE MY TICKETS BOOKED TO SEE IT IN IMAX 3D AM ON THE OF DECEMBER SOMETHING QUITE INTERESTING HAPPENED WHEN I BOUGHT MY TICKETS I STAYED UP TILL MIDNIGHT TO GET THEM SELECTED MY SEATS BUT BEFORE I HAD TIME TO PAY THE SEATS WERE SOLD TO SOMEONE ELSE I PICKED DIFFERENT SEATS OUT AND THEY WERE SOLD BEFORE I GOT A CHANCE TO PAY AS WELL

I BOUGHT MY TICKETS FOR FFA AS SOON AS THEY BECAME AVAILABLE BUT IT WAS HOURS AND HOURS UNTIL THE GOOD SEATS STARTED TO SELL OUT RO SEEMS TO BE SELLING OUT FASTER WHICH I NEVER EXPECTED

BESIDES ALL THAT I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE ANOTHER STAR WARS MOVIE IN THE CINEMA
ANY NEWS IF THE IMAX EXPERIENCE IS COMING TO THE US
HEY THAT'S MY STAR WARS CELEBRATION VIDEO SOMEONE ELSE IS HOSTING IT ON MIMEO THOUGH
WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT THIS MOVIE BEATS THE FORCE AWAKENS AT THE BOX OFFICE I ACTUALLY THINK THEY ARE PRETTY HIGH AT THIS POINT
SOUNDTRACK PREVIEW FROM EW TODAY WHETHER THAT'S JUST AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE SCORE LIKELY OR AN ACTUAL SNIPPET LESS LIKELY IS YET TO BE SEEN
BOUGHT TICKETS FOR THE WITH A FEW FRIENDS TO WATCH IT IN A SPECIAL SCREEN OUR CINEMA HAS TWICE AS BIG AND WITH VIP SEATS HYPE
HOW ARE WE FEELING ABOUT THE RESHOOTS DO WE THINK THE FILM IS LESS DARK THAT ORIGINALLY IMAGINED IS THAT A GOOD THING THOUGHTS
HAS ANYONE TALKED ABOUT HOW OBI WAN COULD POSSIBLY BE IN THE MOVIE HE WOULDN'T BE AS OLD AS ALEC YET SO EWAN COULD STILL PLAY HIM
I REALLY DUG THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MARK WAS SLOW FOR ME BUT THE BUILDING SENSE OF ANXIETY AS THE EROS CAME TO REALIZE THEY WERE BEING MANIPULATED BY KRENNIC WAS FANTASTIC

AS A FATHER AND HUSBAND I HAD MORE TO GRIP PERSONALLY WITH THE BOOK I'LL PROBABLY GET HATE FOR THIS BUT I FELT IT HAD MORE SUBSTANCE THAN LOST STARS IT COULD BE MY CURRENT STATION IN LIFE BUT IT RESONATED MORE WITH ME
LOVED IT KRENNIC IS SUCH A GREAT CUNNING CHARACTER HE REMINDS ME OF PETAR BAALISH FROM GAME OF THRONES PERPETUALLY CHARMING DUPLICITOUS AND SELFISH I'M VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN GALEN LYRA AND HIM

OTHER NOTES

GLAD MAS ALMEDA IS GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION IN THE NEW CANON HE DESERVES IT HE'S A GREAT CHARACTER

I LIKED LARKIN DEALING WITH THE CORPORATE SECTOR IT WAS A STRANGE TANGENT BUT ILLUSTRATED THE GROWTH AND CONQUESTS OF THE EMPIRE WELL

ALSO COOL HOW THEY FOUND WAYS TO SNEAK BOGGLE GUBACHER NEVO BINDI AND SUCH IN I REALLY LOVE HOW CONNECTED THE UNIVERSE FEELS
HAS IS A GREAT CHARACTER I LOVED HIS INTERACTIONS AND DIALOGUE IN THE SITUATIONS WHERE HE KNEW HE WAS SCREWED I HOPE HE MAKES AN APPEARANCE EITHER IN REBELS OR THE COMICS
IM SUPER EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GROWN UP AYN AND SAW GERAERA IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN ROGUE ONE WHEN I WATCHED THE TRAILER I NEVER THOUGHT THEY WERE ALREADY CLOSE SAW SEEMED TO ME LIKE THE OBI WAN STYLE HERMIT THEY TO TO FOR ADVICE BUT NOW IM HOPING HE IS A MUCH LARGER PIECE OF THE PLOT
THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST STAR WARS BOOK FROM WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE IT DIDN'T REALLY MATCH WHAT A LOT OF THE NEW CANON BOOKS HAVE BEEN LIKE

THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ACTION IN IT APART FROM THE DROID INVASION DURING THE CLONE WARS AND INCURSION INTO THE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS THERE WERE NO REAL BATTLES IT MOSTLY CAME DOWN TO TALKING THINKING AND MANIPULATION OF PEOPLE WHICH I AM FINE WITH I ALMOST GOT A BREAKING BAD VIBE FROM IT GENIUS SCIENTIST WORKS WITH CRYSTALS GETS PUT IN A POSITION THAT DOESN'T RESPECT HIS INTELLECT HIS SCIENCE EVENTUALLY STARTS DOING HARM TO HIS FAMILY WILLFULLY IGNORANT OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF HIS ACTIONS

I THINK IT HELPED TO HAVE LUCENT ON BOARD WHO KNOWS HOW TO WRITE IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE ESPECIALLY SINCE HE KNOWS HOW TO WRITE LARKIN MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE THE BOOK DID AN EXCELLENT JOB SETTING UP THE PERSONALITIES OF ROGUE ONE AND I'M INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THE EFFECT READING IT WILL HAVE ON WATCHING THE MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME WILL I BE BORED BECAUSE I DON'T NEED MANY SCENES OF CHARACTER INTRODUCTION OR WILL I BE ABLE TO MAKE LEAPS AND CONNECTIONS OTHER AUDIENCE MEMBERS WONT BETWEEN REBELS THE ASHOK NOVEL AND THIS BOOK THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE FOCUS ON GYBER CRYSTALS RECENTLY I WONDER IF THIS IS ALL SETTING UP SOME BIG REVEAL FOR THE MOVIE

THIS BOOK FELT VERY POLISHED DIRECTED AND DIDN'T REALLY DRIFT INTO UNNECESSARY STORIES GALEN CHARACTER RELIED A BIT TO HEAVILY ON THE TROPE OF ABSENTMINDED GENIUS I ENJOYED GETTING A VIEW OF WHAT ACADEMIA IS LIKE IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE

SOLID BOOK
THE RIVALRY BETWEEN KRENNIC AND LARKIN WAS FASCINATING I LOVE SEEING THE BEHIND THE SCENES POLITICS THAT DON'T SHOW UP IN THE MOVIE
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE KRENNIC AND ERGO ON SCREEN AND WHAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS LIKE AND IF IT TRANSFERS FROM THE BOOK AT ALL
I REALLY ENJOYED IT TONS OF JUICY DETAILS ABOUT THE TIMELINE OF THE DEATH STAR PROJECT GREAT BACKGROUND STUFF

IT'S ONLY REAL FLAW WAS THAT THERE WASN'T MUCH OF A CLIMAX AND ONLY A SLIGHT SENSE OF DANGER ESTABLISHED I NEVER REALLY FELT LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTERS WERE IN MUCH DANGER THE THIRD ACT TIED EVERYTHING UP A LITTLE TOO QUICKLY AND THE SET UP FOR THE SPACE BATTLE AT THE END FELT RUSHED OR ALMOST LIKE A DISTRACTION HOWEVER THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND BACKGROUND ABOUT THE MOTIVATIONS FOR THE CHARACTERS OF ORSON CRENIC AND GALEN ERGO WAS FANTASTIC I ALSO LIKE HOW IT ESTABLISHED MOTIVES AND SET UP CRENIC FOR HIS EVENTUAL FAILURE AND DOWNFALL I AM LARKIN AND IT HAS SOME NICE TO THAT BOOK AS WELL

OF THE NEW CANNON BOOKS I RATE IT THIRD BEHIND LOST STARS AND BLOODLINE AS ONE OF MY FAVORITES
I LIKED THE RIVALRY THEY SHOWED BETWEEN KRENNIC AND LARKIN LARKIN WILL OBVIOUSLY WIN BUT KRENNIC DEFINITELY HAS A FEW TRICKS UP HIS SLEEVE I STILL THINK HE WILL DIE IN ROGUE ONE POSSIBLY AT HAND AND I AM WONDERING HOW MUCH LARKIN WILL HAVE TO DO WITH IT
I'M ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH BUT I WANTED TO SAY THAT THE WRITING STYLE IS JUST AMAZING I LOVE STYLE BECAUSE HE WRITES HIS OWN STORIES WITH THE SW UNIVERSE AS A BACKDROP WITH SOME OTHER BOOKS I FEEL LIKE THE AUTHORS TRY TO MAKE A SW STORY IN THE SW UNIVERSE AND IT ENDS UP FEELING FORCED I DON'T KNOW HOW TRUE THAT MAY BE BUT TO ME BOOKS FLOW SO MUCH BETTER THIS MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE NUCANON NOVEL SO FAR REPLACING LOST STARS AND BLOODLINE I TEND TO LIKE THESE POLITICAL BOOKS MORE THAN OTHERS
THE ENDING WAS A BIT RUSHED BUT ALL THE CHARACTERS WERE BRILLIANT AND WELL DONE

ESPECIALLY KRENNIC WAS WELL DONE HE'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF AN EVIL SCHEMER STEREOTYPE AND YET HE WAS ENJOYABLE AND MOSTLY BELIEVABLE AND IT'S NOT LIKE A STEREOTYPICAL VILLAIN IS OUT OF PLACE WITHIN THE EMPIRE
WITH THE WAY THAT THE BOOK ENDED I'M PRETTY MUCH CERTAIN THAT HE WILL DIE IN ROGUE ONE AND IT WILL BE GLORIOUS

I REALLY ENJOYED THE SETTING OF THE STORY FOR A STAR WARS NOVEL IT WAS VERY MUNDANE AND DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF ACTION BUT I REALLY LIKED BEING ABLE TO SEE THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
ESPECIALLY THE PERSPECTIVE ON THE CONFLICT WITH THE SEPARATISTS WAS GREAT AND I REALLY LIKED LYRA PERSPECTIVE ON THE JEDI AND THE FORCE

THE INSIGHT INTO THE GEONOSIAN SOCIETY WAS ALSO GREAT I LOVE THE IDEA OF HOW THE GEONOSIANS NEED A BIG PROJECT IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PEACE BETWEEN THEM IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE FOR THEM AS A SPECIES EXPLOITING IT IN ORDER TO BUILT THE DEATH STAR MAKES IT EVEN BETTER
IT WAS ALSO THE POINT WHERE I FELT LIKE KRENNIC ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS A SIGNIFICANT FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH

SPEAKING OF KRENNIC IT WAS NICE TO SEE LARKIN ACTUALLY FACE A CHALLENGING OPPONENT I WONDER IF LARKIN WILL APPEAR AT ALL IN ROGUE ONE AND IF THEY WILL CONTINUE THEIR CONFLICT IN THE MOVIE

GALEN ERGO WAS ALSO A GREAT CHARACTER HE WAS A BIT NAIVE BUT I REALLY LIKED HOW UNCOMPROMISING AND ABSOLUTE HE WAS WHEN IT CAME TO HIS CORE VALUES AND HOW QUICKLY HE TURNED AGAINST KRENNIC AFTER REALIZING THAT HE'D BEEN MANIPULATED INTO BUILDING A WEAPON

THE EXTRA LORE ABOUT THE GYBER CRYSTALS WAS GREAT TOO THAT'S THE SECOND NOVEL IN A ROW THAT'S FOCUSED PARTLY ON THE GYBER CRYSTALS I WONDER IF THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF BIG PAYOFF FOR ALL THAT INFORMATION SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE
NOW THAT THEY HAVE A PROPERLY COORDINATED NEW CANON IT CERTAINLY SEEMS PLAUSIBLE THAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO SOMETHING BIG WITH GYBER CRYSTALS AND GIVING US LITTLE SNIPPETS OF INFORMATION TO PREPARE US BEFORE IT HAPPENS

EVEN THOUGH THE ENDING WAS RUSHED I ACTUALLY QUITE ENJOYED BATTLE AGAINST LARKIN TOWARDS THE END OF THE NOVEL IT WAS SOME GOOD CHARACTER PROGRESSION FOR HAS AND TYPE OF BATTLE THAT THEY HADN'T REALLY EXPLORED BEFORE AS FAR AS I KNOW
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT SUCH PROLONGED SIEGES BEFORE BUT UNTIL NOW WE'VE MOSTLY SEEN VERY BRIEF AND SUCCESSFUL SIEGES IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE NEVER REALLY THE KIND OF STALEMATE THAT FORMED BETWEEN LARKIN AND THE SALIENT SYSTEM

SAW GERAERA WAS ALSO PRETTY COOL WE DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF HIM BUT IT WAS ENOUGH TO GET ME HYPED FOR HIS ROLE IN THE UPCOMING MOVIE

I RAMBLED A BIT LONGER THAN I INTENDED BUT I HOPE THAT THE FORMATTING MAKES IT SOMEWHAT BEARABLE
OVERALL IT WAS SIMPLY A GREAT BOOK IT'S DEFINITELY IN MY TOP FOR THE NEW CANON
IT'S SOMEWHAT DRY ALTHOUGH NOT AS MUCH AS PLAGUERS SO IT WON'T BE IN EVERYONE'S WHEELHOUSE BUT I LOVE ALL OF THE RECENT EMPHASIS IN THE NEW CANON ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE EMPIRE'S OPERATIONS AND THE RESOURCES IT HAS TO DRAIN FROM THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF WORLDS WHETHER THEY'RE INHABITED OR NOT

I'M A HUGE LARKIN FAN SO ANY EXTRA MATERIAL INVOLVING HIM IS A PLUS IN MY BOOK THE RIVALRY WITH KRENNIC WILL HOPEFULLY PAY OFF NICELY WHEN VADER INEVITABLY KILLS KRENNIC AT THE END OF ROGUE ONE NOT A SPOILER JUST A GUESS

I REALLY LIKED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SAW GERAERA AND HAS BITT THERE WAS ALSO A GREAT LINE FROM SAW ABOUT HOW YOU FIGHT FOR YOUR GOALS DREAMS SO THAT SOMEDAY ANOTHER PERSON WILL ACHIEVE THEM WHETHER YOU'RE THERE TO SEE IT OR NOT TOTAL PARAPHRASE BUT THAT'S THE BASIC IDEA IT MADE ME SAD BECAUSE IT READ LIKE A LINE FROM A PERSON WHO WON'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE EVENTS OF ROGUE ONE BUT VERY INSPIRING NONETHELESS

I ALSO LIKED SEEING A BIT MORE FROM MAS ALMEDA WE'VE BARELY GOTTEN ANYTHING FROM HIM UNTIL AFTERMATH LIFE DEBT SO IT WAS NICE TO SEE HIM AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS DIPLOMA

AGREED WITH THE OTHER REDDITION WHO SAID THAT THERE WASN'T MUCH OF A CLIMAX WHICH IS INEVITABLE WHEN WE KNOW THAT ALL OF THE EROS WILL ESCAPE

I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR ANY FAN PRIOR TO SEEING THE MOVIE A MORE CASUAL FAN PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET MUCH OUT OF IT
I STRUGGLED WITH THIS ONE AND HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH THE LAST IT NEVER REALLY FULLY GRABBED MY ATTENTION

I DID FIND MYSELF REALLY INTERESTED IN LYRA AND HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT THE JEDI AND THE FORCE BUT THOSE MOMENTS IN THE NOVEL WERE FLEETING EDIT I ALSO ENJOYED APPEARANCE BUT OVERALL NOT ENOUGH ACTION AND CHARACTERS I COULD REALLY FALL IN LOVE WITH THERE'S NEW CHARACTERS FROM OTHER CANON NOVELS THAT I'M NUTS FOR AND THIS NOVEL JUST LACKED THAT FOR ME
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION BETWEEN KRENNIC OBIT AND LARKIN IN THE END

KRENNIC THINKS OBIT ESCAPED FROM LARKIN AND CONTINUES TO WORK FOR HIM

LARKIN ACTUALLY STRIKES A DEAL WITH OBIT TO SPY ON KRENNIC SO OBVIOUSLY LARKIN DOESN'T GO AFTER OBIT AS IF HE WAS AN ESCAPEE

KRENNIC THINKS HE IS AN ESCAPEE BUT LARKIN ISN'T COMING AFTER HIM

SHOULDN'T THIS INDICATE TO KRENNIC IMMEDIATELY THAT OBIT DID NOT ESCAPE AS HE WAS TOLD


I LISTENED TO THE AUDIOBOOK SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO GO BACK AND GO OVER


ONLY ABOUT THROUGH CURRENTLY NOT MY FAVORITE BUT IT'S CERTAINLY INTERESTING A NICE LOOK AT THE POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN KRENNIC AND LARKIN AND SOME HISTORY OF THE DEATH STAR PLUS MORE GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT GYBER CRYSTALS

NOT A LOT OF ACTION LOST OF NEW CHARACTERS AND PLANETS TO REMEMBER
SO THE PLANS FOR THE DEATH STAR CAME TO THE HANDS OF THE REPUBLIC DURING THE SECOND BATTLE OF GEOGNOSIS THIS IS A MAJOR RETCONNING BECAUSE I REMEMBER THAT THE DEATH STAR WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION BY THE SEPARATIST AND THE DEATH STAR CONSTRUCTION BALLED INTO THE HANDS OF THE RECENTLY FORMED EMPIRE WHEN VADER KILLED THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE SEPARATIST COUNCIL COOL BOOK THO THE WOOKIEPEDIA NEEDS TO MAKE A MAJOR ACTUALIZATION OF THE INFORMATION OF THE DEATH STAR NOW LAO
IN THREE YEARS
MAN THE REVEAL AND LOOK OF LUKE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PERFECT I DIDN'T EVEN GIVE A SHIT THAT HE DIDN'T SHOW UP UNTIL THE LAST SECONDS OF THE MOVIE IT WAS FUCKING PERFECT
STRANGE THAT HE NO LONGER USES THE FAKE SKIN COVER FOR HIS ROBOTIC HAND
JUST LIKE AN OLDER WINE IT GETS A LITTLE METALLIC NEAR THE END
MY DAD ACTUALLY MENTIONED THAT THIS WEEKEND HE SAID HE AGED MUCH BETTER THAN THE REST OF THE CAST AND ACTUALLY LOOKS BETTER NOW IN HIS OPINION THAN HE DID AS A YOUNGUN
SOME PEOPLE AGE LIKE A FINE WINE I ON THE OTHER HAND AGE LIKE A FINE MAYONNAISE
HE IS
THE MOST INTERESTING MAN IN THE GALAXY
CRAZIEST THING IS THAT MARK IS OLDER THAN ALEC GUINESS WAS IN A NEW HOPE
IS HE GOING TO MAKE RAE CARRY HIM ON HIS BACK
I AGREE ALSO BACK THEN IT BEEN EXPENSIVE TO KEEP GIVING HAND A DAMAGED LOOK SO THEY JUST THREW ON A GLOVE INSTEAD LOL
WHILST TECHNOLOGY HASN'T ADVANCED A GREAT DEAL FOR SEVERAL MILLENIA IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE AT LEAST HAIR PRODUCTS HAVE
I'M SO EXCITED FOR ROGUE ONE BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST GONNA GIVE ME BLUE BALLS FOR EPISODE VIII
GUYS GOT AN AWESOME HEAD OF HAIR
MY CHILDHOOD CRUSH AND HE REMAINS SO AS I BECOME AN ADULT
HE TURNED INTO EDWARD JAMES OLMOS
HE LOOKED REALLY GREAT IN THAT REVEAL NOW I ONLY HOPE HE LOOKS AND SOUNDS AS GOOD WHEN MOVING ACTING AND HOPEFULLY FIGHTING
HE WAS LOOKING LIKE SHIT A FEW YEARS BACK BEFORE HE GOT INTO SHAPE FOR THE ROLE
NEEDS A PIC TO SHOW THE TRUTH MARK DID A TON OF WORK AND COMPLETELY TONED UP FOR THE ROLE AFTER BEING COMFORTABLY DOUGHY WHILE DOING VOICES FOR THE LAST YEARS
IF YOU DISCOUNT ODD YEARS OF MISMATCHED EMPLOYMENT
CRAZY HOW HAND TECHNOLOGY HAS GOTTEN WORSE MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THE TREACHEROUS REBELLION HAS DESTROYED THE GALACTIC ECONOMY AND REVERSED DECADES OF PROGRESS NOT THE LEAST DESTROYED TWO PEACEKEEPING INSTALLATIONS R EMPIREDIDNOTHINGWRONG
YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE ALMOST YEARS AGO RIGHT
UNLIKE LEA AND HAN WHO LOOKED LIKE SHIT
HIS HAIR LOOKS BETTER THAN IT DID IN ROTC
MMMMMMMMMYYYEEESSSSS LUKE TAKE IT OFF THE HOOD THAT IS
SNAKE
I ACTUALLY JUST GOT TRUE JEDI ON ISLAND LAST NIGHT THANK YOU LEGO STAR WARS THE FORCE AWAKENS
HAMILL LOOKS GREAT THESE DAYS
WHY DO YOU GUYS THINK HE DOESN'T KEEP THE SKIN ON THE ROBOT HAND I THINK IT'S ONE OF A COUPLE IF POSSIBLE REASONS A LESS SKIN UPKEEP AND EASIER TO GET TO ROBOT PARTS FOR REPAIRS B WANTS TO BE CONSTANTLY REMINDED OF THE SHIT THAT WENT DOWN YEARS AGO C DOESN'T WANT TO FORGET NOT TO DO STUPID THINGS OUT YOU WILL LOSE ANOTHER HAND
WE'RE OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OLD
EVERY TIME I SEE THIS SCENE I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE HOW HE LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A SMALL HAND
WELP TIME TO ADD AGED LUKE SKYWALKER TO THE LIST OF FANTASY CHARACTERS I WOULDN'T MIND BEING STRANDED ON A DESERT ISLAND WITH

OR AS MY HUSBAND CALLS IT THE LIST OF PEOPLE HE HAS TO NOW ELIMINATE
UM YES
IS THIS POST SARCASTIC IF SO I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT'S WRONG AND SEXIST

OH WAIT THAT'S LUKE AND NOT LEIA OK IT'S FINE THEN
CORK VERSUS SCREW CAP
SAME PEOPLE TAKING OFF THEIR HOODIES DECADES APART

FAFFY
JUST A QUICK QUESTION HOW HAS THE TECHNOLOGY OF HIS ROBOTIC HAND GOT WORSE NOW IT'S COMPLETELY METAL WHEN BEFORE IT APPEARED TO LOOK LIKE SKIN SORRY I LOVE STAR WARS THIS JUST BUGGED ME
I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS HE LOOKS LIKE OLIVER REED
EVERY TIME I SEE A SHOT OF OLD LUKE I CANNOT HELP BUT WONDER HOW HE DOES ANYTHING AT ALL WITH THAT HAND AS SOMEONE WHO IS RIGHT-HANDED AN APPENDAGE THAT'S GOING TO GET CAUGHT IN MY HAIR WOULD BE THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING I RUN MY HANDS THROUGH MY HAIR A LOT THAT HAND WOULD TEAR OUT HALF MY HAIR BEFORE I GOT IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE LENGTH

NOT TO MENTION IT'S METAL WHICH IS COLD

AND HOW DOES HE GRIP ANYTHING WITH METAL FINGERS ARE THERE GRIPPY PADS ON THE FINGERTIPS

I CANNOT HELP BUT WONDER THESE THINGS
MY FINE WINE ALSO LOSES A HAND
FEEL LIKE HE DID IT WITH A BIT MORE FLOURISH IN FORCE AWAKENS
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE SAME PERSON
LUKE IS THE ENEMY
MARK HAMILL TURNS INTO ANTHONY HOPKINS
A LONG TIME AGO
THE ACTUAL METAL PROSTHETIC LOOKS WAY BETTER IMHO
HE STILL TICKLES MY FANCIES
LOOKS LIKE ALAN WATTS
ANYONE ELSE EXCITED TO SEE HIM IN A LIGHTSABER BOUT AGAIN
WORKING WITH THE MASTER
I'M NOT GAY BUT
WELL I MIGHT BE GAY
I'M GAY FOR MARK HAMILL
TAKE MY STRONG HAND
I JUST WANNA SEE LUKE FUCK SOME SHIT UP AND KICK SOME ASS
HIS HOOD GOT MUCH BIGGER THOUGH
HE AGED LIKE MILK
HIS HAND DIDN'T

EDIT WHY IS THIS BEING SO DOWNVOTED
THE LUKE REVEAL AT THE END OF FFA WAS ONE OF MY LEAST FAVORITE STAR WARS MOMENTS FFA IS LITTERED WITH THEM
AND PRESSURES HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND INTO GETTING AN ABORTION
LEIA AGED LIKE BREAD DUCKS
EPISODE VII SUCKS
AGES LIKE A FINE WINE LEFT IN A BOILER ROOM
WHY COULDNT THEY HAVE GIVEN HIM SOMETHING MORE TO DO THAN JUST BE STANDING ON A CLIFF

I LOVE THAT HE IS ON AN ISLAND BEING AROUND WATER MUST BE SUCH A LUXURY TO LUKE AFTER GROWING UP ON TATTOOING WHY NOT SHOW HIM FISHING GARDENING GOING BACK TO HIS FARMBOY ROOTS BUT NUMBER JUST STAND ON THE CLIFF MARK THATS AS MUCH EFFORT WE ARE WILLING TO PUT IN
WHATS WRONG WITH THAT OLD MANS HAND
EDH MORE LIKE A
I MEAN THERE ARE ALWAYS FORCE SENSITIVE CHILDREN PEOPLE OUT THERE ORDER LEFT SURVIVORS AS WELL AS A PLETHORA OF PEOPLE THE JEDI DIDN'T PICK UP BECAUSE WELL THE JEDI ARE GONE

I MEAN SURE THERE COULD BE SURVIVORS OF ACADEMY SEEMS LIKE A THING THAT COULD HAPPEN

BETWEEN YOUR TWO OPTIONS I WOULDN'T MIND EITHER
I REALLY HOPE LUKE IS NOT LITERALLY THE LAST ONE THE JEDI NEED TO COME BACK AT SOME POINT AND THAT POINT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AFTER ROTC HENCE THE TITLE

IT JUST SEEMS SO WEIRD TO ME THAT LUKE ENDED UP BEING THE LAST WHEN THE JEDI WERE SUPPOSED TO RETURN IT'S A STRANGE DECISION
I'M STILL HOLDING OUT HOPE THAT THE KNIGHTS OF REN ARE ALL FORMER STUDENTS
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS ASSISTANTS HE HAD TO BEGIN WITH BUT I COULD IMAGINE THAT ONLY A HANDFUL WOULD HAVE SURVIVED BY MERE CHANCE IF ANY AND THEY JUST GTO FROM THERE AND NEVER LOOKED BACK I SURE HOPE THERE ARE FEW SURVIVORS


I THINK IT DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON THE SIZE OF ORDER IF IT WAS REALLY IN ITS EARLIEST STAGES THEN KALO REN ABSOLUTELY HAD THE CAPABILITIES TO ERADICATE IT

IF IT WAS LARGER AND SOMEWHAT ESTABLISHED THEN ONE MAN SIMPLY CANNOT DO IT ALONE EVEN WITH THE ENTIRE GAR UNDER ORDER THERE WERE SOME JEDI SURVIVORS

I'M NOT SURE WHERE LUCASFILM WOULD INSERT THE REMAINING JEDI WITHOUT DEVALUING THE PLOT OF EPISODE VII HOWEVER
I'M HOLDING OUT HOPE THAT SOME OF STUDENTS SURVIVED AND THAT THE REAL REASON HE DISAPPEARED IS SO THAT HE COULD KEEP THEIR SURVIVAL A SECRET AND FINISH THEIR TRAINING
I AM GUESSING THAT LUKE IS THE LAST JEDI WHICH IS DUMB BUT THEY SEEM TO JUST BE REHASHING THE ORIGINAL THEMES
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE UNLIKE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD JEDI ORDER THE REPUBLIC'S ARMY PROBABLY DIDN'T TURN ON THEM AS WELL
HAMM THERE HAS TO BE FORCE SENSITIVE PEOPLE AROUND THAT MAY HAVE NOT EVEN JOINED JEDI ACADEMY SO IF NUMBER IS THE CASE HE CAN GET MORE AND IF REY WAS A CHILD IN THE ACADEMY OR A CHILD ABOUT TO JOIN WHO KNOWS WELL SHE IS FORCE SENSITIVE AND CAN BE TRAINED THERE'S WHAT YEARS BETWEEN HER AND KALO REN
I THINK IT'S A BIG ASSUMPTION TO CONTEND THAT ANY OF STUDENTS WERE KILLED AT ALL HAN SAYS THE NEW GENERATION WAS DESTROYED BUT DESTROYED COULD MEAN MANY THINGS

LIKE MAYBE THEY BECAME THE KNIGHTS OF REN
I STILL BELIEVE IN THE THEORY THAT LUKE LEFT REY ON ZAKKEU BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT LUKE ALSO SENT THE OTHER SURVIVORS AWAY TO DIFFERENT PLANETS
THESE REPAINTS ALWAYS REMIND ME JUST HOW SHITTY MOST TOYS LOOK THESE DAYS WELL DONE
SO THE ORIGINAL MODEL DOESN'T EVEN COME WITH THE WING MARKINGS

JESUS CHRIST HOW FUCKING BUDGET IS THAT

NICE WORK ON THE REPAINT THOUGH IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY I'D RECOMMEND CHECKING OUT THE BAN DAI MODEL KIT THE KITS THEMSELVES ARE VERY SIMPLE AND A LOT OF FUN TO PUT TOGETHER NO GLUE AND THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS THEY REALLY COME ALIVE WITH A DECENT PAINT JOB THOUGH AND YOU'VE SHOWN HERE YOU'D DEFINITELY BE CAPABLE OF IT
GREAT JOB IT'S A SHAME THAT CAN'T TURN INTO AN X THOUGH
GREAT KID BUT DON'T GET COCKY
ULEMA
THAT LOOKS AWESOME

I REPAINTED THE SAME TOY A WHILE AGO BUT I REALLY LIKE YOURS BETTER
THAT LOOKS AMAZING MY ONE CRITIQUE WOULD BE THAT THE CANOPY STILL LOOKS A LITTLE WEIRD
LOOKS AWESOME LIKE A BEFORE AND AFTER FIRST BATTLE
ONE OF THE GUNS FELL OFF
HEHEHE
THAT LOOKS GREAT NICELY DONE
WELL IF IT LOOKED LIKE THAT I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ONE
GOOD STUFF
DAMN AMAZING WORK
GREAT WEATHERING
DID YOU BREAK ONE OF THE WINGS OFF
HOLY SHIT THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME YO
FOAH THIS IS AMAZING
WOW THE NEW STAR WARS TOYS SUCK ASS THEY LOOKED LIKE THE REPAINT IN TERMS OF QUALITY WHEN I WAS A KID I GREW UP WITH THE FIGURES EDITION SO I MAY HAVE BEEN SPOILED BUT WHENEVER I GO INTO THE STORE AND SEE THE NEW TOYS I'M APPALLED THAT ANYBODY WOULD LET THEM LEAVE THE FACTORY THEY'RE SO POORLY MADE AND THE PAINT APPS ARE CRAPPY
I'D SAY YA FUCKING NAILED IT
AWESOME BUT FINISH THE WINDOW
IT'S NOT PAINT IT'S DEGOBAH SWAMP DIPPING TECHNIQUE
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PAINTING MODELS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A GLOSS PAINT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE WINDSHIELD LOOKS GREAT OTHERWISE
SO HOW WOULD SOMEONE GO ABOUT DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS DID YOU USE AN AIRBRUSH
I BELIEVE YOU MEANT TO SAY BEFORE AND AFTER A SERIES OF SUCCESSFUL REBEL MISSIONS
NICE JOB WERE THE DIRT MARKS DONE RANDOMLY OR BASED ON A PICTURE OF THE ACTUAL ORIGINAL
I GOT A SECOND ONLY SAW THE TOP IMAGE AND IN MY INFINITE WISDOM THOUGHT YOU RESTORED AN OLD TOY I WAS LIKE YEA LOOKS TRUE TO HOW THE ORIGINAL WOULD LOOK THEN I SCROLLED DOWN AND WAS AWESTRUCK BY WHAT I SAW THIS IS AMAZING WORK
HARD TO BELIEVE THOSE ARE THE SAME MODEL THE BEFORE LOOKS SO DAMN CHEAP VERY NICE JOB
MOST IMPRESSIVE
DAMN IT LOOKS LIKE MOSTLY A WASH PAINT BUT IT LOOKS SUPERB WELL DONE

VERY NICE WORTH EVERY SECOND PUT INTO IT
MAN THAT LOOKS SO GOOD HANG IT FROM A CEILING SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE
GLAD THE SECOND PICTURE IS THE AFTER FOR A SECOND I WAS LIKE WHY THE HELL IS IT SO WHITE
LOOKS AWESOME
IT LOOKS AWESOME
YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR ACTUAL X WING AND PRETEND YOU PAINTED IT
I THINK YOU COULD TEACH THOSE HACKS A FEW THINGS
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD EXCEPT THE FALLS FLAT COMPARED TO THE REST REMINDS ME A BIT OF AN OLD CHALKBOARD COULD USE SOME HIGHLIGHTS OR SOMETHING
DID YOU FIX THE WING
GOOD JOB
LOOKS PRETTY FUCKING GOOD TO ME
NICELY DONE
NICE WEATHERING MAN G
LOOKS ABOUT A MILLION TIMES BETTER
IT LOOKS GREAT
LOVE EVERYTHING BUT THE WINDOWS
JESUS CHRIST THAT'S INCREDIBLE I REMEMBER BEING REALLY YOUNG AND SEEING AN TOY IN A CATALOG THEY MADE IT LOOK SO COOL AND DETAILED AND WHEN I WENT TO THE STORE TO GET IT IT LOOKED LIKE SHIT IT WAS SIMILAR TO THE BEFORE PICTURE YOU HAVE HERE BUT WORSE
BUT WHAT YOU DID IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE PLEASE POST MORE IF YOU END UP CONTINUING THIS HOBBY
PRETTY DANK
JUST IN TIME TO FUCK UP THOSE
FUCKING BEAUTIFUL
HOW DO YOU LEARN TO DO THIS
IMAGER SEEMS TO BE HAVING PROBLEMS SO I CAN'T VIEW THE IMAGE BUT I WILL SAY THAT YOU GOT ME TO DO A SEARCH FOR THE REVELL MONOGRAM FIGHTER PLASTIC MODEL KITS AND HOLY SHIT THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE AROUND AS A KID I HAD THOSE AND I KNOW THAT I DIDN'T PAY THE EQUIVALENT OF FOR THE STAR WARS MODELS THAT I BOUGHT
I DONT HAVE JE SKILL TO DO THAT SO AMAZING
REALLY LIKE THE HEAVY EXACTS YOU PLACED ON THE ENGINES QUICK 2 QUESTIONS WHAT KIND OF PAINT DID YOU USE ENAMEL ACRYLIC ETC AND HOW DID YOU APPLY IT AIRBRUSH PAINT BRUSH ETC
CIRC THESE WERE USED IN THE DISTANCE OF SOME SHOTS TO IMPLY THE SET WAS LARGER THAN IT WAS VIA FORCED PERSPECTIVE

CAN'T REMEMBER IF THEY'RE KIDS OF PEOPLE ON SET I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE JAVAS IN STAR WARS WERE CHILDREN OF PRODUCTION PEOPLE I THINK GARY KIDS MAYBE
I WANT TO SEE MORE OF THAT MINI

THIS IS JUST LIKE WHAT THEY DID IN ALIEN USING CHILDREN INCLUDING RIDLEY SONS JAKE AND LUKE AND THE SON OF DEREK VALIANT THE CINEMATOGRAPHER WITH SCALED DOWN COSTUMES AND PROPS THE SMALLER LASER PISTOL IS BASED ON THE WEBLEY JUNIOR AIR PISTOL HERE'S OF A COUPLE AND 2 TO MAKE THE DERELICT SET SEEM BIGGER I THINK THOSE ARE THE CHILDREN BASED ON THE HEIGHT OF THE GUYS IN THIS PICTURE THE CHILDREN ACTUALLY NEARLY COLLAPSED DUE TO THE HEAT OF THE SUITS AND EVENTUALLY OXYGEN SYSTEMS WERE ADDED TO ASSIST THE ACTORS IN BREATHING
THEY RECRUITED THEM YOUNG BACK THEN
COLORIZEBOT
THEY DID A SIMILAR THING IN THE LAST SCENE OF CASABLANCA THE PLANE WAS A CARDBOARD CUT OUT AND THE ENGINEERS AND PILOTS WERE MIDGETS
THAT'S AMAZING
THE LITTLEST REBELS
LUCKIEST KIDS ALIVE
WELL IN REAL LIFE REBELLIONS OFTEN USE CHILD SOLDIERS THIS MAKES ME SAD
MOST PLANETS THAT EXISTED IN LEGENDS ARE STILL WHERE THEY WERE AS FOR ENDERON AND THE NEW ONES THERE ARE A FEW MAPS OUT CURRENTLY

ONE FOR FFA

ONE FOR ROGUE ONE

AND ONE MORE JUST BECAUSE

THEY'RE ALL THE SAME CANON GALAXY BUT WITH DIFFERENT FOCUSES AND ANGLES

THIS FIRST MAP HAS THE PROMINENT PLANETS FROM MOVIES AND ACW BUT DOESN'T COVER ALL PLANETS IN CANON

STARWARD IMAGES LATEST CB


PERSONALLY I SUGGEST THIS MAP BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT HAS LEGENDS PLANETS MIXED IN IT WILL HAVE ALL THE CANON PLANETS AS WELL PLUS IT WON'T HURT TO KNOW WHERE SOME LEGENDS PLANETS ARE

STARWARD IMAGES REVISION LATEST CB
THERE'S A BOOK COMING OUT SOON THAT'S CALLED STAR WARS GALACTIC MAPS THAT BOOK WILL PROBABLY HAVE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
PLEASE DON'T SAY DISNEY STAR WARS GALAXY EVER AGAIN

CALL IT CANON STAR WARS GALAXY INSTEAD DISNEY DOESN'T EVEN REALLY IMPACT STORY DECISIONS
I THINK THEY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER ROGUE ONE HAS BEEN OUT AWHILE BEFORE DRAWING PEOPLE'S ATTENTION TOWARD VIII WE MIGHT NOT SEE A TRAILER OR HEAR A TITLE UNTIL APRIL
AS I'M SURE MANY OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS SUBREDDIT HAVE NOTICED THE TITLES MIRROR EACH OTHER ACROSS THE PT AND THE OT I'VE HEARD LUCAS SAY THAT THE STORIES RHYME THIS IS THE SAME CONCEPT

THE MIDDLE FILMS BOTH SHOW A RESPONSE TO THE FIRST FILM WITH THE EMPIRE ATTACKING HOTH AFTER REELING FROM THEIR LOSS OF THE DEATH STAR AND THE BEGINNING OF THE CLONE WARS AFTER YEARS OF PLANNING BY PALATINE MUCH OF WHICH OCCURS DURING TPM

SO IF THIS TITLE HAS TO RHYME WITH ROTC AND ESB IT HAS TO HAVE ONE OF THE GROUPS RESISTANCE OR NEW ORDER ACTING IN SOME WAY AGAINST THE OTHER

I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THE FLIGHT OF THE RESISTANCE OR HUNT OF THE ORDER
HAND OF THE MASTER
THE FIRST ORDER STRIKES BACK
I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS I'M STILL PULLING FOR SHADOW OF THE EMPIRE
ALTHOUGH UNLIKELY I'D LIKE TO SEE WRATH OF THE ORDER
STARKVILLE BASE 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
EPISODE VIII MEMBER EPISODE VII
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN BUT SIEGE FROM THE SHADOWS
STAR WARS EPISODE VIII HAN SOLO RETURNS
SNOKE AND MIRRORS
STAR WARS EPISODE VIII SEIGE OF THE KNIGHTS
A NEW NEW HOPE
WELL IF TSF IS ACTUALLY THE INITIALS OF THE TITLE FROM ARIAN INSTAGRAM THEN MAYBE THE SIEGE OF THE FALLEN OR THE SHATTERED FAITH OR THE SILENT FEAR
THE WAY OF THE JEDI
THE FALLEN ORDER
A NEW HOPE RENEWED
FALL OF THE RESISTANCE
EDIT SOMEONE ELSE ALREADY SAID IT
PERSONALLY I HOPE THEY DON'T GO FOR A OF THE TITLE EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE ACTUALLY ONLY USED IT TIMES IT STILL FEELS OVER USED

I THINK A GOOD ONE-WORD TITLE COULD GO OVER WELL RETALIATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT DDK
I DONT THINK WE WILL GET THE TITTLE BEFORE NEXT APRIL SO I HOPE SOMEONE REMEMBERS TO LOOK BACK WHEN IT'S REVEALED AND SEE IF SOMEONE HERE GOT IT RIGHT
ROGUE TWO
STAR WARS TONS OF BANDALORE GALORE
THE ORDER RISES

IT KEEPS THE THEME OF WAKING UP AND IT APPLIES TO BOTH THE FIRST ORDER AND THE JEDI ORDER

AN ANCIENT FEAR WAS PHENOMENAL TITLE THEY SHOULD HAVE USED
THE FORCE AWAKENS 2
IT WILL PROBABLY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH A WAR I'D ARGUE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO ATTACK OF THE CLONES SEEING AS THE NEW REPUBLIC HAVE TO ENGAGE THE FIRST ORDER NOW
I THINK IT WILL BE IN KEEPING WITH THE SECOND MOVIE OF BOTH TRILOGIES ATTACK AND STRIKES BACK IT'LL CONTAIN SOME ACTION EXCLAMATION POINT WORD
IF IT FOLLOWS THE STORY THAT I THINK WOULD BE MOST INTERESTING SIEGE OF THE UNKNOWN WOULD WORK I'M HOPING THAT LEIA UNITES WHAT'S LEFT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THEY DECIDE TO GO AFTER THE FIRST ORDER IN THE UNKNOWN REGIONS BUT LITTLE DO THEY KNOW IT'S A TRAP
THE SHADOW FALLS


U ROBOTICAL
THE SECOND COMING REFERENCING THE RETURN OF THE JEDI AND NOW THE SECOND RETURNING OF THE JEDI
STAR WARS THE ENDLESS DUEL

STAR WARS LOYALTIES IN STRIFE

STAR WARS OF VISIONS AND REVELATIONS

STAR WARS THE FORCE ABIDES

EDIT DOWN VOTES WHAT THE HELL I WAS BEING SERIOUS EXCEPT FOR THE LAST ONE WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU A CHUCKLE REALLY WHAT THE HELL THE FIRST TITLE HARKENS BACK TO THE SONG DUEL OF FATES ENDLESS BECAUSE THE LIGHT AND THE DARK WILL ALWAYS BE IN CONFLICT EVEN WHEN IN BALANCE MAYBE THE NEXT MOVIE DEALS WITH THAT BECAUSE FOR SURE WE'LL GET KALO BACK STORY

THE SECOND TITLE HINTS AT THE CHARACTERS POSSIBLY CHANGING SIDES IN THE NEXT MOVIE

THE THIRD IS EASY AND I DON'T LIKE IT TOO MUCH BUT FOR SURE THE NEXT MOVIE WILL DEAL WITH VISIONS AND WHAT THEY REVEAL

THE FORTH IS JUST A JOKE JEEZ
STAR WARS EPISODE RISE OF THE FIRST ORDER
MYSTERIES OF THE REN
HOPE RETURNS
STAR WARS EPISODE VIII BACK IN THE HABIT
TEACHINGS OF THE FIRST JEDI
I THINK DID IT WELL WITH THE CLONE ARMY REFERENCE
I'D ADD LITTLE THINGS A THUG OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF BAD GUY WITH A CLONE HELMET THAT'S BEAT TO SHIT SOME CLONE WARS ERA WEAPONS BEING USED AND MAYBE SOME CRASHED SHIPS
REFERENCES TO PREQUEL PLANETS LIKE CORUSCANT OR BABOO
FINN IMPRESSED BY PROWESS BEHIND THE CONTROLS OF AN EXCLAIMS THAT'S SO WIZARD
SOME BATTLE DROID PARTS LYING AROUND SOMEWHERE ON ZAKKEU

EDIT THOUGHT THE TITLE SAID VII COULD STILL WORK IF ZAKKEU IS IN VIII
EWAN MCGREGOR AS FORCE GHOST
PIT DROIDS WORKING ON SHIPS
SNOKE IS REVEALED TO BE AN ELDERLY JAR JAR BANKS
IT WOULD BE A MUSICAL REFERENCE FOR SURE

J DID SOME OF HIS BEST WORK IN THE PREQUEL AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR APPROPRIATE NODS TO ACROSS THE STARS OR THEME FOR EXAMPLE
SOMEONE SELLING AN OLD CLONE WAR ERA ARMOR OR AN OLD DROID AS A SERVICE DROID WOULD BE COOL OTHERS MENTIONED SOME OLD SCHOOL BLASTERS THAT COULD BE COOL TOO
THE EXTENDED FORCEBACK SEQUENCE INCLUDE A COUPLE FLASHES IN THE CLONE WAR THE MUSTAFAR DUEL AND THE I HATE YOU ALONG WITH A COUPLE FLASHES OF LUKE WITH IT AND A BRIEF FLASH OF THE CLOUD CITY DUEL AND I AM YOUR FATHER

JUST TO KEEP PRESENCE LOOMING IN A MORE DIRECT WAY
PLAGEUIS

IF SNOKE ISN'T PLAGEUIS I'LL BE A BIT DISAPPOINTED

I'D PREFER THE STORY TO COME FULL CIRCLE RATHER THAN JUST CONTINUE ELSEWHERE

UNLESS THEY HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF COURSE


SPECIES TAKE HALF OF HYE NEW SPECIES INTRODUCED AND REPLACE THEM WITH PREQUEL SPECIES THAT WOULD BE A GREAT BALANCE BETWEEN OLD AND NEW I'D LOVE TO SEE A CLAWDITE AM SPECIES CASUALLY SHIFT IN THE BACKGROUND OF CANTINA
SHACKS ROAMING THE COUNTRYSIDE IN THE BACKGROUND WHAT A GLORIOUS BEAST
NOT TASTEFUL BUT IF THE PLANET THAT BLEW UP WAS CORUSCANT I'D BE HAPPY
SOME KIND OF VISUAL REFERENCE TO YODA OR KENOBI CONSIDERING HOW IMPORTANT THEY WERE TO THE NEW REPUBLIC'S FOUNDING I WAS HOPING TO SEE THEM ON CURRENCY OR A STATUE

THEN AGAIN THE JEDI WERE STILL JUST LEGENDS TO REY SO I'M GUESSING THE NEW REPUBLIC DIDN'T GIVE THEM THEIR DUE
IF WE'RE GOING TO DELVE DEEPER INTO THE LORE OF THE JEDI IN WHICH I THINK IS A DEFINITE POSSIBILITY THEN I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND OF CONNECTION TO THE WAYS AND STYLINGS OF THE JEDI ORDER AS SEEN IN THE PREQUEL EVEN IF LUKE IS DELIBERATELY REJECTING THE OLD WAYS LET HIM OUTRIGHT SAY THAT SO WE KNOW THE CONTRAST IS AN INTENTIONAL ONE WHATEVER THEY DO I JUST HOPE THEY GROUND THE JEDI MYTHOLOGY IN THE HISTORY ESTABLISHED BY THE PREQUEL RATHER THAN TRYING TO SNEAKILY REDEFINE THE WHOLE THING

SAME GOES FOR THE NEW REPUBLIC IF WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THAT THEN ESTABLISH A THEMATIC CONNECTION BETWEEN THE THE TWO ERAS OF DEMOCRACY EVEN IF THAT MEANS SHOWING THE NR AS BEING DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY UNLIKE THE OLD REPUBLIC
SINCE THE FORCE IS NOW GREATLY UNSEEN AND PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY IT'S TRUE I'VE SEEN IT I THINK IT'S BE FUN TO HAVE A DOUBTER IMPLYING PALATINE WAS JUST A MAN SAY SOMETHING TO THE TUNE OF WE ALL KNOW THE EMPIRE WAS JUST BORN OUT OF THE SENATE
THEY TALK ABOUT THE JEDI AND THE JEDI TEMPLE ON CORUSCANT
JAR JAR SHOWS UP ON SCREEN AND IS IMMEDIATELY GUNNED DOWN BY BOTH SIDES GOOD AND BAD ALIKE
SOMETHING SMALL THAT WON'T DISTRACT THE VIEWER SIMILAR TO FINN GRABBING THE PRACTICE DROID OUT OF THE JUNK BOX ON THE FALCON I'M THINKING MAYBE A CLONE HELMET DISCARDED ON A SHELF OR A POWERED DOWN BATTLE DROID LEANING AGAINST A WALL IN A JUNK SHOP

OR LESS SUBTLY AND A DIRECT REVERSAL TO ANAKIN REY IS NEAR SOME SAND OR IT COMES UP IN CONVERSATION AND SAYS SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF I DON'T MIND SAND IN FACT IT REMINDS ME OF HOME IT'S SLIGHTLY COMFORTING
SNOKE IS UMBRIAN
SOMEONE LOVINGLY HOLDING SOMEONE BY THE LAKES OF BABOO EW NUMBER I CAN'T EVEN KID ABOUT IT

HOW ABOUT WE DON'T GET INTO THE TRAP OF REFERENCING EVERY THING THAT CAME BEFORE IT WOULDN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT HAS PASSED FROM PREQUEL EVENTS TO EPISODE
DARTH MAUL RETURNS

UNLESS HE MEETS HIS END SOMETIME DURING CERTAIN CARTOONS
THOUGHT THIS WAS REALLY AWESOME SO I DECIDED TO POST IT ON HERE HOPE ITS COOL AND HOPE YOU ENJOY IT




COOL IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE CHARACTER CARDS FROM DRAGON AGE INQUISITION
MY DAD LOVES BOOKS ESPECIALLY IN THE SCI-FI FANTASY GENRE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN THE S HE HAD LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF THEM ALL WRITTEN BETWEEN AND OR SO NEATLY SHELVED IN OUR BASEMENT AND STARTING AROUND AGE I WAS GIVEN FREE REIGN TO READ ANYTHING IN THIS MASSIVE LIBRARY THIS IMAGE COULD HAVE LANDED ON ALMOST ANY OF THOSE BOOK COVERS THANKS FOR THE MEMORY
MY HEART SKIPPED A BEAT BEFORE I REALIZED THIS WAS FAKE
HALO REACH A STAR WARS STORY
THE FUNERAL OF JINN
I SAW NOBLE END FIRST BEFORE I REALIZED IT WAS FAKE ALMOST SHIT MYSELF
IT'LL BE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY IF MICHAEL GIACCHINO DOESN'T CALL THE END CREDITS TRACK ROGUE ONE'S NOBLE END
HONESTLY THAT'S HOW I SEE THE MOVIE GOING THEY ALL DIE IN THE END
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I'M MOST EXCITED FOR ABOUT ROGUE ONE IS ACTUALLY TRACK TITLES
GAVE ME A GOOD LAUGH
WHEN IS THIS SOUNDTRACK DUE OUT ANYWAY I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING STAR WARS AS I SUSPECT HE'LL BE THE ONE TO TAKE THE REINS ONCE THE MAESTRO PASSES INTO THE GREAT BEYOND
DUDE IT TOOK ME WAY TOO LONG TO REALIZE THIS WAS A JOKE I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT HOW IT MADE ME FEEL IT MADE ME FEEL BAD MAN
NOT GIACCHINO ENOUGH WORLD'S WORST NOBLE END
QUI AGONS NOBLE END

THAT SPOILER FROM PM LOL
EVERYONE DEAD DAVE
LOL
NICE TO SEE GIACHINNO BRANCHING OUT AND NOT DOING PUN TITLES EVERY TRACK
YEAH KRENNIC IS A COMPLETE COCKADOUCHE DEFINITELY ONE OF THE PILOTS OF THE DOUCHE CANOE
HAHA THAT'S AWESOME
HOLY SHIT I THOUGHT THIS WAS REAL FOR A SECOND XD
I CHUCKLED
ALL JOKES ASIDE THIS IS MOST LIKELY THE ORDER OF HOW THINGS WILL GO DOWN
THAT WAS GOOD BUT I REALLY AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE ACTUAL LIST PUN GAME IS UNSTOPPABLE ON HIS SOUNDTRACKS
I BOLED
THIS REALLY MADE ME LAUGH THANKS
YOU SHOULD MOST DEFINITELY NAME IT THAT'S ONE HELL OF A PILOT

THIS SCENE MADE ME CREAM
YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS OFF ON THE WINGS JUST AN FYI
DUDE THIS TAKES ME BACK TO THE HOURS I WOULD SPEND DRAWING AND PAINTING STAR WARS EVERYTHING AS A KID AS A TEN YEAR OLD WHEN THE PHANTOM MENACE CAME OUT THE NEW SHIPS AND CHARACTERS CAPTURED ALL OF MY IMAGINATION IF YOU'RE HERE TODAY YOUR SKILLS ARE GOING TO BE AMAZING IN YEARS TO COME
SOMEONE DIDN'T LISTEN TO YODA WHEN HE SAID THEY WOULDN'T NEED THEIR WEAPONS INSIDE THE TREE
PROBABLY LEFT BEHIND BY A MOISTURE FARMER I'D ASK OLD BEN KENOBI ABOUT IT
THIS WAS BURIED A LONG TIME AGO
I REMEMBER THOSE THINGS AS KIDS AH THE MEMORIES OF GETTING YOUR FINGERS SMACKED BY YOUR FRIENDS
AN ELEGANT WEAPON FOR A MORE CIVILIZED AGE
YOUR FATHER WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS WHEN YOU WERE OLD ENOUGH BUT YOUR UNCLE WOULDN'T ALLOW IT
WHATEVER YOU DO JUST BE SUPER CAREFUL IF YOU DECIDE TO HIT THAT BUTTON DON'T LET ANYONE STAND TOO CLOSE TO THE BUSINESS END OF THAT THING WHEN YOU DO OR THEY'RE GOING TO REGRET IT

IF IT SPARKS UP RED YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BURY IT AGAIN AND PLANT A TREE OVER IT
KEEBLER ELVES AIN'T SCREWING AROUND
I LOST A PLASTIC LIGHTSABER JUST LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS OR
THAT'S MY ALL TIME FAVORITE LIGHTSABER

ONE DAY I'LL INVEST IN A QUALITY HILT AS AN UPGRADE TO MY FORCEFUL
PADAWAN LIGHTSABER
AHH THEY DON'T MAKE EM LIKE THEY USED TO
DID YOU FIND A COPY OF AWAKENING DX EDITION FOR GAMDEBOO AND A SINGLE GREY SMARTWOOL SOCK DOWN THERE TOO ASKING FOR A FRIEND
DID IT HAVE A GAMECUBE IN IT
MY FATHER DUG UP A KENNER CHEWBACA EARLIER THIS YEAR HE THOUGHT IT WAS A ROOT AT FIRST
BRBJCTT


GK

DANIT OP DID YOU CHOP DOWN THE LIGHTSABER TREE IT WAS JUST GETTING READY TO BEAR IT'S HARVEST OF BANG LIGHTSABERS
I AM NO JEDI BUT I KNOW THE FORCE IT MOVES THROUGH AND SURROUNDS EVERY LIVING THING CLOSE YOUR EYES FEEL IT THE LIGHT ITS ALWAYS BEEN THERE IT WILL GUIDE YOU THE SABER TAKE IT
IT CHOSE YOU
THERE'S BEEN AN AWAKENING
IT CALLS TO YOU
I KNOW I'M DUMB BUT I TRIED TO TURN IT ON TO SEE IF ITS REAL
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A WATER PIPE AND DUG THE REST UP ANYWAY
PLEASE OPEN IT UP AND TELL ME HOW LONG THE BLADE IS MY BROTHERS AND I USED TO HAVE SOME AROUND AND I KNOW THE ONES THAT ARE BEING SOLD RIGHT NOW ARE SHORTER BUT JUST HOW MUCH SHORTER ARE THEY
I'M NOT SURE IF ANYONE MENTIONED THIS BUT IT'S POSSIBLE SOMEONE PUT THAT ITEM UNDER A TREE THEY PLANTED AS A MEMORIAL AFTER LOSING SOMEONE THEY LOVE
THERE WAS A HAND TOO DID YOU FIND THE HAND
AS A YEAR OLD ADULT IF I HAD FOUND THIS BURIED IN THE GROUND I WOULD STILL PAUSE AND QUESTION MY REALITY FOR A SECOND
AN ELEGANT SPRINKLERHEAD FOR A MORE CIVILIZED LAWN
THE FORCE IT'S CALLING TO YOU

JUST LET IT IN
THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A HAND AS WELL
WAS THERE A HAND WITH IT
AN ELEGANT WEAPON FOR A MORE CIVILIZED AGE
DID YOU JUST UNEARTH A DEAD KID'S LIGHT SABER SAY A KID WHO LOVES STAR WARS GETS CANCER OR SOMETHING AND DIES THEIR GRIEF STRICKEN PARENTS BURY THIS TOY LIGHTSABER WITH A TREE THAT THEY EITHER PLANTED IN THE KID'S MEMORY OR BY AN ALREADY ESTABLISHED TREE THE KID ALSO LOVED TO CLIMB OR SOMETHING


YOU MONSTER
MUST HAVE BEEN CALLING TO YOU
POINT IT AT YOUR FACE AND TURN IT ON I HEAR THATS HOW YOU CHECK IT IF WORKS THEN AGAIN I COULD BE WRONG SOME BLONDE FARM BOY TOLD ME THATS HOW HE DID IT NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT GUY

THE FORCE IS OBVIOUSLY STRONG IN YOU AND YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE THE WEAPON THE WEAPON CHOSE YOU
SO THIS IS SUPER WEIRD HEY OP YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO LIVE IN UTAH DO YOU
YOU'RE THE CHOSEN TWO NOW GO AND ROB A GAS STATION
AND NOW IT BELONGS TO YOU
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER MY BUDDY FAMILY WAS PRETTY WELL OFF AND FOR CHRISTMAS ONE YEAR THEY BOUGHT HIM LIKE OR MORE GI JOE COBRA SOLDIERS BECAUSE HE WANTED HIS OWN COBRA ARMY LIKE THE CARTOON WHEN HE WAS SHOWING ME HIS COLLECTION I WAS LIKE DAMN LOOK AT ALL THESE COBRA SOLDIERS THAT IS WERE PROBABLY LIKE THERE HE SAID OH I HAD A LOT MORE OF THEM BUT I KEPT KILLING THEM IN COMBAT AND BURYING THEM AND THEN FORGETTING WHERE I BURIED THEM RATHER THEN SEARCH FOR THEM HE JUST SAID THE HELL WITH IT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A DEAD GI JOE COBRA SOLDIER TREE GROWING IN A SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD
DID YOU JUST DIG UP BOD BAAR
THE FORCE IS CALLING YOU
YOU KNOW HOW OBI FIRST LIGHTSABER FALLS DOWN THE HOLE DID MAZ FIND IT AND GIVE IT BACK TO HIM LATER ON
WHERE DID YOU DIG UP THAT OLD FOSSIL
WAS THERE A HAND WITH IT THERE BEEN A HAND
NOW JUST GO FIND A CONSTRUCTION VEST BY A KROGER POST UP BY A PARKING LOT AND MAKE SOME SWEET CASH

WRONG SUB
THERE'S ALWAYS A LIGHTSABER IN THE BANANA TREE
IT CALLS TO YOU NOW IT IS YOUR DESTREENY
UNEARTHED A TREE TODAY FOUND THIS BURIED IN THE DIRT UNDERNEATH THOUGHT IT WAS IT'S CHILD
FAFFY
AH
A MORE ELEGANT WEAPON FOR A MORE CIVILIZED AGE
IT IS YOUR DESTINY THE FORCE IT CALLS TO YOU
IS THAT TREE BOD BAAR
I WON'T LIE I BURIED MY LIGHTSABER UNDER MY GRANS TREE A GOOD FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS QUI AGONS DESIGN WITH A RED BLADE AND YEAR AGO I WENT BACK TO THE SPOT WHERE IT WAS AND IT WAS RIGHT THERE NOW IT'S ON MY SHELF REMINDING ME OF THE CHILDHOOD
WAIT WHAT AREA DO YOU LIVE IN I REMEMBER BURYING A LIGHTSABER NEAR MY CHILDHOOD HOME JUST FOR LOZ FORGOT TO DIG IT UP
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WANTED TO JOIN R LIGHTSABERS BUT GOT LOST ALONG THE WAY
THERE HAS BEEN AN AWAKENING IN THE FORCE
DID YOU HAVE A HUGE FLASHBACK WHEN YOU TOUCHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN THE DISTANCE THESE ARE YOUR FIRST STEPS
THAT'S PRETTY NEAT I THINK ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS BACK WHEN I WAS A KID IN MY BACKYARD FOREST AREA AT MY GRANDPARENTS HOUSE THERE'S DEFINITELY ALL DIFFERENT TOYS THAT I'VE LOST OVER THE YEARS OF GROWING UP THERE FOUND A BLASTODISC POKEMON FIGURE BURIED IN THE DIRT LIKE YEARS AGO
NOW YOU HAVE THAT POWER TOO
INSANE I BOUGHT A HOUSE THIS YEAR AND I BELIEVE YOURS IS THE SAME THAT WAS HIDDEN UNDER THE MOUNTAINS OF PINE STRAW IN MY BACK YARD
THE WAND CHOOSES THE WIZARD HARRY
SHIT DUDE I THINK YOU'RE THE CHOSEN ONE
AS A CHILD I WAS CONVINCED THAT SOMEWHERE BURIED IN THE GROUND WAS A MAGIC LIGHTSABER THAT WOULD GIVE ME ALL SORTS OF CRAZY POWERS AND ABILITIES HAD I FOUND THIS THEN I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE PISSED MYSELF AND THEN BEEN INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED THAT SAID YOU SHOULD TRY USING THE FORCE AGAIN SOMETIME WHILE CARRYING THAT THING JUST IN CASE
WAS THERE A HAND
THAT'S NO IRRIGATION
KIDWIFI THESE ARE YOUR FIRST STEPS
IT'S PROBABLY A MURDER WEAPON
AFTER YOU TOUCHED IT DID YOU GET A SERIES OF VISIONS OF BEING ABANDONED WITNESSING A MASSACRE AND ENCOUNTERING A GANG OF GOTH TEENS
THIS IS HOW A GREAT QUEST BEGINS
YOU THINK YOU FOUND IT NO IT FOUND YOU
IT IS FROM A LONG LONG TIME AGO LOOK HOW DIRTY IT IS
AN ANCIENT WEAPON FROM A MORE CIVILIZED TIME
I FEEL LIKE THIS WOULD BE THE SETUP FOR AN AWESOME STAR WARS STORY A PERSON STUMBLES UPON THE LONG BURIED REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT BATTLEGROUND OF THE JEDI AND SITH UNEARTHING AN ANCIENT LIGHTSABER WHILE TILLING THE SOIL MIRACULOUSLY IT STILL WORKS AND SAID PERSON SLOWLY BEGINS TO HIM OR HERSELF IN THE WAYS OF THE FORCE
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS IT CHOSE YOU
I THINK THE FARMER WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED ON HOW TO MANUFACTURE GYBER CRYSTALS
THERE WAS A HAND DID YOU FIND THE HAND
THIS WEAPON IS YOUR LIFE
YOU'LL BE CROWNED THE KING NOW
MIGHT BE A REAL ONE
THAT WAS PROBABLY SOME KIDS TIME CAPSULE
THATS NOT IRRIGATION
GUSSY IT UP HOWEVER YOU WANT REBECK WHAT MATTERS IS DOES IT WORK
UR FATHER KEPT IT WITH WHEN HE DIED LUKE TAKE IT
OBVIOUSLY A FORCE TREE YOU KNOW BUZ THAT'S A THING
WHAT IF A KID BURIED THAT THERE FOR SOME WEIRD MEMORY AND WAS GONNA GET IT IN YEARS AND NOW YOU DUG IT UP
MACE HINDU
I KNOW FOR A FACT THERE ARE A FEW OF THOSE BURIED IN MY FOLKS BACKYARD
HOW LONG WOULD YOU ASSUME IT WAS BURIED
HURRY RUN PUT IT BACK SHE WAS SAVING IT FOR THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE
THAT'S A SIGN THE FORCE BROUGHT IT TO YOU
I GOT THE SAME ONE AT HOME
MY FRIENDS AND I MADE A COLLAPSABLE BONG OUT OF ONE OF THESE DURING OUR ADOLESCENCE COMPLETE WITH A SHOT GLASS AMO DUCT TAPED TO THE BOTTOM AND A MAKESHIFT SLIDE OUT OF A RATCHET HEAD HAMMERED ONTO AN ALUMINUM PIPE
OH MY GOD A LIGHTSABER
I'M WONDERING WHY OP SAW AN IRRIGATION HEAD BY A TREE AND DECIDED TO START DIGGING IT UP SICK FIND REGARDLESS
I USE TO HAVE THAT EXACT TYPE WAS IT GREEN
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER AS A KID THESE FIRST COMING OUT LIGHT SABER WAS REALLY RARE BECAUSE A LOT GOT RECALLED BECAUSE LIKE THE BATTERY WOULD SPARK OR SOMETHING WE HAD THE OBIWAN AND QUINON SET AND OUR FRIENDS WERE SO JEALOUS BUT I WAS JEALOUS CAUSE THEY HAD DARTH MAULS SABER AND MY MOM WOULDN'T LET ME GET IT CAUSE HE LOOKED LIKE SATAN
SO THAT'S WHERE IT WENT AFTER IT WAS KICKED DOWN THE SHAFT
DID IT HAVE A HAND ATTACH TO IT
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE
THE FORCE ITS CALLING FOR YOU JUST LET IT IN
I HAD THIS VERY LIGHT SABRE AS A KID BRINGS BACK SO MANY MEMORIES
THAT'S NO IRRIGATION PIPE ITS A REMNANT OF A CHILDHOOD GETS CAUGHT IN TREE'S TRACTOR BEAM
THERE HAS BEEN AN AWAKENING
APPARENTLY THERE IS ANOTHER SKYWALKER
THAT WAS THE FIRST EVER TOY LIGHTSABER I HAD I WAS KNOWN LOCALLY AS SOMEONE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT WITH ONE

YEARS LATER I CAN STILL KICK MY YOUNGER COUSINS ASSES IN A SABER FIGHT

MAYBE DUE TO THE FACT THEY'RE JUST KIDS BUT
THE CHOSEN ONE HAS BEEN FOUND TO LEAD THE REPUBLIC
SO IT IS REAL
THAT LIGHTSABER IT BELONGS TO ME
I REMEMBER THESE ME AND MY DAD USED TO BATTLE AGAINST EACH OTHER I ALWAYS USED DARTH MAULS AND I REMEMBER MY DAD USED COUNT HE WOULD BRING NEW ONES ROUND EVERY NOW AND THEN LIKE AFTER WE WATCHED EPISODE HE SURPRISED ME WITH CODAS AND DARTH SIMIOUS ONES SO MANY GOOD MEMORIES ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS WHEN I WENT IN A STROP AFTER HE KILLED ME HE PUT HIS LIGHTSTABOUR AWAY AND I THEY MINE PROPERLY THE BEST THROW OF MY LIFE TO THIS DATE BECASSE THE LIGHSABOUR COMBATED DOWN INTO HIS EYE AND NOW HES GOT REALLY BAD VISION IN THAT ONE EYE HAHGAHAAHAHAHA
DOES IT DOES IT WORK
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE
THE FORCE IS MEASURED IN NEWTONS
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE
OP IS THE CHOSEN ONE
IT'S TRUE ALL OF IT
THAT LIGHTSABER WAS AND HIS FATHER'S BEFORE HIM AND NOW IT CALLS TO YOU
I'M WAITING FOR THE SWELLING JOHN WILLIAMS SCORE
IT CHOSE YOU
NOW YOU MUST TRAVEL TO A SMALL ISLAND TO MEET THE OWNER AND COMMENCE TRAINING
FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT I WAS ON R WHATISTHISTHING
MY LITTLE BROTHER HAS THAT LIGHTSABER
THIS IS PROBABLY THE SAME WAY MAZ ENDED UP WITH LIGHTSABER JUST FOUND IT UNDER A TREE

NO SUCH THING AS COINCIDENCE YOU KNOW
AND NOW IT CALLS TO YOU
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE THE SABER CALLED OUT TO YOU
WELL IT DOES SAYS A LONG TIME AGO AT THE START OF THE MOVIE
THE SABER IT CALLS TO YOU
IT WAS EARTH ALL ALONG YOU BLEW IT UP YOU MANIACS

WAIT WRONG MOVIE

AH YES A WEAPON MUCH LIKE YOUR FATHER'S
WAS A THE GENOA TREE I HEAR YOU CAN FIND WEAPONS UNDER IT
YOUR FATHER WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS WHEN YOU WERE OLD ENOUGH I BURIED HERE FOR SAFETY
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE LEFT THE JEDI ORDER AROUND THE TIME OF ORDER TO FAKE THEIR DEATH
SO I'M GUESSING THERE ARE TWO HOLES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REACTOR CORE ONE LEAD TO THE DUMPSTER AND THE OTHER LED TO UPS

NO WONDER PACKAGES ARE SO BEAT UP WHEN YOU GET IT
ARE YOU ON BABOO
R THATHAPPENED
WASNT THERE A JEDI WHO TURNED INTO A TREE WHEN HIS STAR WENT NOVA MASTER HOODOO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THIS ALONE SHOULD BE THE PLOT OF A STAR WARS MOVIE
IT'S YOUR FATHER'S LIGHTSABER
YOU MUST GO ON A JOURNEY NOW
IT CALLS TO YOU
R THATHAPPENED
RICK AND TOM WERE BEST FRIENDS THEY MET IN FIRST GRADE AND BOTH BROUGHT STAR WARS FIGURES FOR SHOW AND TELL THEY FOUND OUT THAT THEY LIVED NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER AND SPENT MOST OF THEIR AFTERNOONS FIGHTING THE FORCES OF EVIL AND SAVING THE GALAXY RICK WOULD PLAY OBI WAN AND AND TOM WOULD ALWAYS PLAY LUKE IT HAD TO BE THAT WAY SINCE RICK WAS TWO MONTHS OLDER AND THEREFORE WISER WHEN THEY WERE ELEVEN YEARS OLD THEY WERE PLAYING NEAR THE LARGE TREE IN BACKYARD THEY OFTEN PRETENDED THAT THE LOW HANGING BRANCHES WERE LIGHT SABERS OWNED BY WICKED MEMBERS OF THE DARK SIDE ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY IN THE MIDST OF A HEATED LIGHT SABER BATTLE TOM SUNK TO HIS KNEES AND COLLAPSED RICK TURNED TO LECTURE TOM ABOUT HOW JEDI COULD NEVER BE DEFEATED BUT KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WHEN HE SAW THE LOOK ON FACE TOM UTTERED A SMALL HELP AND CLOSED HIS EYES RICK RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD TO GET HELP BY THE TIME THEY HAD RETURNED TOM HAD PASSED AWAY

THE DOCTORS NEVER COULD EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHY TOM DIED AFTER THE FUNERAL RICK WALKED INTO HIS BACKYARD AND DISCOVERED LIGHT SABER IN THE DUST NEAR THE TREE HE BURIED THAT LIGHT SABER AT THE BASE OF THE TREE BECAUSE THE SIGHT OF IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM RICK IS THIRTY NOW AND HIS PARENTS HAVE LONG SINCE MOVED OUT OF THAT OLD HOUSE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE RICK FINDS HIMSELF DRIVING BY THAT OLD HOUSE AND THINKS OF THE LIGHT SABER BURIED UNDER THE OLD TREE AND THE FRIENDSHIP IT REPRESENTED THE KIND OF FRIENDSHIP THAT TRANSCENDS DEATH THE KIND OF FRIENDSHIP LUKE AND SHARED
THERE WAS A HAND TOO DID YOU BRING THE HAND
A SONIC SCREWDRIVER NEAT
I KNOW OP IRL AND HE DIDN'T FIND THAT BURIED UNDERGROUND CALLING BULLSHIT THAT'S A TYPE OF DILDO AND IT'S CLEARLY CAKED IN FECAL MATTER
IT MAY BE A DUSTY HAND-FILLED SHITHOLE BUT I CAN'T NOT LOVE TATTOOING IF I THINK STAR WARS THAT'S THE FIRST LOCATION I SEE
BABOO COME ON IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
IF I HAD TO PICK ONE PLACE TO LIVE AT

BABOO OR ALDERMAN OF COURSE

SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A FUCKING SNEEZE
BESPIN HANDS DOWN THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL ABOUT CLOUD CITY THAT CAPTURES MY IMAGINATION EVERY TIME THAT COMBINED WITH JOHN WILLIAMS SCORE MAKES IT PERFECT
CORUSCANT SINCE BEFORE IT EVEN EXISTED ON SCREEN IT SOUNDS LIKE SUCH AN INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO LIVE AND A MONUMENT TO CIVILIZATION'S EXCESSES AND EXCEPTIONALISM
BABOO AND IT'S NOT REALLY CLOSE ALDERMAN IF WELL YOU KNOW
I WAS ALWAYS FOND OF MUSTAFAR MYSELF
THATS NOT A PICTURE OF BANDALORE THATS THE DEATH WATCH BASE ON CONCORDIA MOON

MY FAVORITE PLANET IS PROBABLY UMBRA BECAUSE OF ITS INTERESTING PLANT LIFE THAT LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT

CLOSE SECOND WOULD BE RAMUS SECUNDUS BECAUSE OF THE AUTUMN COLORS

EDIT A BETTER PICTURE FOR BANDALORE WOULD BE THE DOMED CITIES SURROUNDED BY THE WHITE DESERT OR THE INSIDE OF THE CITIES
IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY EVERY SINGLE PLANET IS SO BEAUTIFUL IF I HAVE TO PICK ONE MAYBE HOTH SIMPLY BECAUSE IM FROM NORWAY AND IT WAS SHOT IN NORWAY
RIGHT NOW I'M FEELING SARIF
FELECIA
NAR SHARDANA IT IS A PLACE FOR SMUGGLERS AND GENERAL TROUBLE MAKERS FOLKS LIKE BOBA FETT AND IG THOSE CHARACTERS ARE THE KIND OF CHARACTERS THAT I WOULD MAKE UP STORIES FOR WITH MY IMAGINATION WHEN I WAS A KID TO ME THAT IS A HUGE PART OF WHAT STAR WARS IS ABOUT WANTING MORE STAR WARS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU BUILD STUFF UP IN YOUR MIND

ALSO NAR SHARDANA STREETS WAS MY FAVORITE MAP ON JEDI KNIGHT II JEDI OUTCAST
BABOO HAS A LOVELY BLEND OF ARCHITECTURE AND NATURE BUT BESPIN WOULD BE A NICE GETAWAY FROM DEALING WITH A SINGULAR WEATHER SYSTEM
PYTHON
IF I COULD LIVE ANYWHERE IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE BABOO
DANTOOINE WHERE'S DANTOOINE
TOUGH TO PICK JUST ONE BUT PROBABLY CORUSCANT BABOO IS NICE TOO I'D BE SURPRISED IF ANYONE SERIOUSLY PICKED ZAKKEU THOUGH IT'S SEEMS EVEN DULLER THAN TATTOOING
CERELLIA SHIMMERING BEACHES CRYSTAL SWAMPS AND GOLDEN FLOWING PLAINS THE WHOLE PLANET IS LIKE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
CORUSCANT THOUGH I WISH WE COULD EXPLORE ALDERMAN A BIT MORE
TATTOOING BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME OF MY HOMETOWN PEOPLE FROM RIVERSIDE CA WILL UNDERSTAND
CANAAN AHO CITY
THE FOREST MOON OF ENDOR HAD REMAINED MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE LOCATION UNTIL I SAW DADU AND DADU REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF THE IMPERIAL INSTALLATION ON KENJI IN JEDI OUTCAST AND IS JUST RIDICULOUSLY BEAUTIFUL DEFINITELY A GOOD PLACE TO HAVE A HOMESTEAD ON BETTER THAN TATTOOING ANYWAY I WOULDN'T EVER WANT TO LIVE ON A PLANET THAT'S HOT ALL THE TIME ALWAYS
I'D GO CAMPING ON TAKODANA
LETHAL IT'S SO PRETTY
WHAT ABOUT RYLOTH MYGEETO ETC
I DON'T THINK THE PICTURE FOR KASHYYYK IS A GOOD ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE PLACE
ALDERMAN BECAUSE I WANT TO DIE
KASHYYK WASN'T DONE MUCH JUSTICE IN EP BUT IN THE BOOKS IT WAS A PLANET COVERED WITH TREES THE SIZE OF SKYSCRAPERS WITH DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEMS AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS CRAZY
KORRIGAN WHERE THE LAST GREAT SITH LORDS LAY
CORUSCANT AND UTAPAU

CORUSCANT BECAUSE I LOVE THE CITY AND IT SEEMS SO INTERESTING WITH ALL OF THE LEVELS

UTAPAU BECAUSE ARE NEAT
UTAPAU I WAS AN IMMEDIATE FAN

AND ALDERMAN ALWAYS ALDERMAN
UMBRA WHAT AN INCREDIBLE LOOKING ENVIRONMENT
DATHOMIR THEY HAVE RANCORS
ITS NOT LISTED BUT KORRIGAN THE SITH FASCINATE ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN STAR WARS AND THE PLANET HAS SO MANY MYSTERIES
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT LISTED ENDERON HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE STAR WARS WORLD EVER SINCE I PLAYED KOROR II I'M SO HAPPY THAT IT WAS USED IN CLONE WARS AND GOT TO REMAIN CANNON
DEFINITELY AMINO RAINY OCEAN BUILDINGS THE STRANGELY BEAUTIFUL KAMINOANS I JUST LOVE AMINO
WHERE'S MY CERELLIA THATS HONESTLY ONE OF THINGS I HOPE FOR MOST IN THE SOLO MOVIE IS A CHANCE TO FINALLY SEE CERELLIA MAYBE
EMESA LIKE A BABOO
MUSTAFAR WANNA GET MY SPA ON
TAKODANA GIVE ME ALL THAT NATURES
TAKODANA HOTH
GOTTA SAY BANDALORE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LOCATION IN THE CW SHOW
I ALWAYS FOUND CANAAN TO BE BEAUTIFUL IRONIC CONSIDERING MY DEEP FEAR OF THE OCEAN
FAFFY OP HETP

ALSO I'M GOING TO SAY CORUSCANT
GORGEOUS NEARLY UNINHABITABLE SURE BUT GORGEOUS NONETHELESS
TATTOOING EVERYTHING REALLY STARTS THERE IT'S OUT FAR AWAY FROM EVERYTHING YET SO MUCH HAPPENS THERE AND SOMEHOW I FEEL THAT IN A FEW YEARS WE WILL FIND OUT THAT IT ALL ENDS THERE
CANAAN
ENDOR
ALDERMAN AND CORUSCANT
ALDERMAN IS FOR ME THE BEST COMPROMISE BETWEEN A HIGHLY WELL STRUCTURED SOCIETY SUCH AS CORUSCANT BUT WITHOUT ALL THE NEGATIVE ASPECT OF LIVING UNDERGROUND FOR THE MOST PART OF THE POPULATION CORRUPTION CRIMINALITY IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE A PLANET OF IDEALISM BALANCE JUSTICE

A SHAME THAT NEITHER THE PREQUEL OR CLONE WARS FULLY MADE US DISCOVER THAT BEAUTIFUL PLANET BEFORE HER FATE
BANDALORE CORUSCANT TATTOOING DATHOMIR DAGOBA ENDOR BESPIN HOTH LETHAL MUSTAFAR BAVIN AMINO TAKODANA ZAKKEU BABOO KASHYYYK ALDERMAN GEOGNOSIS UTAPAU

PLACE IN LIST DOES NOT INDICATE EXACT RATING WEIGHT
I LOVED PLAYING THE KOTHLIS MAPS ON THE ROGUE SQUADRON GAMES BUT OFF THIS LIST LETHAL ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE SORT OF NICE AND KIND OF SERENE PLACE
BESPIN
BABOO
OME THIS SUBS NEEDS MORE POSTS LIKE THIS
BABOO WOULD BE MY CHOICE JUST LOVE THE CULTURE AND THE CLIMATE I HOPE WE'LL SEE IT AGAIN IN FUTURE MOVIES
I'D LOVE VACATIONS ON THE BEACHES OF KASHYYYK
ALDERMAN CORUSCANT BABOO AND UTAPAU ARE MY FAVORITES OUT OF THOSE
CORUSCANT OR MUSTAFAR FOR ME
NAR SHADAI SSTOR CAPTURED IT REALLY WELL I THINK AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT LIKE THAT IN A MOVIE OR TV SHOW
THERE'S A STRANGE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE PICTURES OF AND LETHAL BTW THAT'S CONCORDIA NOT BANDALORE
I'D LIVE ON CORUSCANT BUT HAVE A VACATION HOME ON BABOO
KRONOS

THAT'S STAR WARS RIGHT
THE DEATH STAR
UTAPAU MOST OBSCURE PLANET IN CANON PROBABLY
CORUSCANT THERE'S SOMETHING EXTREMELY INTERESTING AND FRIGHTENING ABOUT THE STREET LEVELS THAT I'D LOVE TO SEE INCORPORATED IN THE VIDEO GAMES SOMEHOW ONE REASON I WAS PISSED GOT CANCELLED
KORRIGAN
OF THAT LIST I'D HAVE TO GO WITH BBB ALDERMAN SSTOR JUST MAKES IT LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL
I'LL TAKE DROMOND KAAS THANKS
KASHYYYK LOVED THAT SCENE
I'M CRYING BECAUSE APPARENTLY THIS IS ABOUT AS BIG AS THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE IS NOWADAYS PLUS A FEW WORLDS THAT APPEARED IN ACW RIP THE EU

ALSO FELECIA WOULDN'T WANNA LIVE THERE WITH ALL THE ACKLEY AND FLESH-EATING PLANTS AND SHIT BUT GODDAMN WAS IT RIOTOUSLY BEAUTIFUL
HEY OP IS THIS ORIGINAL CONTENT JUST CURIOUS I'VE NEVER SEEN A CHART OF THESE PLACES LOOK SO NEAT AND SIMPLE
CHRISTOPHSIS
HOW IS FELECIA NOT UP THERE
IT WAS ENDOR UNTIL I PLAYED STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT PLAYING AS EMPIRE UGH
EITHER BABOO OR SARIF BOTH LOOK INCREDIBLE
VULCAN

WAIT DAMNIT WRONG SUBREDDIT
BESPIN SEEMS COOL
I CAN'T CHOOSE BETWEEN BABOO OR BANDALORE BUT I WOULD LOVE BABOO AS A START
MUSTAFAR DOES HAVE A FIERY BEAUTY TO IT THOUGH THAT ATMOSPHERE MUST BE MURDER ON THE LUNGS
BESIN
LETHAL I'M SO EXCITED THEY'RE GOING BACK NEXT WEEK
FELECIA IT'S ONLY SEEN FOR A SPLIT MOMENT DURING ORDER

BUT HAS BEEN SHOWCASED IN MANY OF THE GAMES
ALDERMAN OR BABOO
HOTH SINCE I WAS A KID THE WAS MY FAVORITE VEHICLE IN ANY SHOW OR MOVIE OR GAME EVER JUST SUCH A DOMINATING FORCE AND SUCH A COOL SETTING TO SEE THEM LOOMING IN THE DISTANCE THROUGH THE SNOW
THAT'S NOT BANDALORE

SALLUST I LOVE CAVE EXPLORATION AND THE SULLUSTAN PEOPLE SEEM LIKE VERY INTERESTING PEOPLE EY TEYEDEH AH UH HAMOOKYAK KAY EH
ZAKKEU THE WRECKAGE IS AWESOME
EASILY AMINO IT'S THE MOST A E S T H E T I C OF ALL THE STAR WARS PLANETS
NO CERELLIA OR MON CALAMARI OR ISSUS OR KASHYYK SO I GUESS I WILL GO WITH EITHER CORUSCANT OR ALDERAMIN
GREAT NOW I WANT AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE STYLE OF THE CLONE WARS SHOW
NOW THERE'S A FACE ONLY A BLIND MOTHER COULD LOVE
THE EMPEROR'S SHADOW GUARDS WITH LIGHTSABER PIKES AND ALL VERY NICE
VADER LOOKS VAGUELY CUMBERBATCH
THE PURPLE EYES ON THE STORM-TROOPER ARE A NICE TOUCH
THIS IS FREAKING AMAZING WHERE CAN I FIND MORE
SW HAS SOME OF THE MOST PASSIONATE FANS FOR SURE BUT THERE ARE ALSO MAJOR DIVIDES BECAUSE OF THE PREQUEL SPECIAL EDITIONS ETC THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS PEOPLE GET DOWNRIGHT MEAN ABOUT IT WHICH IS SOMETHING I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IN OTHER FANDOMS LIKE MARVEL SOME PEOPLE LOVE IT ALL OR HAVE A FEW CHOICE THINGS THEY DON'T LIKE BUT IN GENERAL THE FANS ARE APPRECIATIVE DR WHO PEOPLE KIND OF BICKER OVER WHO IS THE BETTER WRITER FOR THE SERIES BUT IT'S USUALLY STILL MOSTLY POSITIVE BANTER

BUT WITH SW I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A LARGE PORTION OF THE FAN BASE WHO JUST GO LOOKING TO START A FIGHT AND ARGUE ABOUT THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AND THEY HONESTLY GET PRETTY HATEFUL OVER IT LIKE WE GET IT THE PREQUEL HAVE SOME CRINGE MOMENTS BUT ON THE WHOLE WE STILL LOVE THEM ONE TYPE OF FAN IS ABLE TO ROLL THEIR EYES SAY OH GEORGE AND MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIFE THE OTHER TYPE ATTACKS THE TASTE AND INTELLIGENCE OF THE FIRST PERSON FOR BEING ABLE TO FIND ENJOYMENT IN THEM OUTSIDE OF THOSE MOMENTS

I THINK THAT COMES DOWN TO A PERSONALITY TRAIT MORE THAN A LIKE OR DISLIKE OF THE CONTENT ITSELF STAR WARS WIDE APPEAL MEANS THAT IT HAS ATTRACTED WIDE EYED AS WELL AS STONE COLD CYNICS STAR WARS IS ONE OF THE ONLY FANDOMS I CAN THINK OF WHERE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE ANABASE SEEM TO WISH HALF OF IT DIDN'T EXIST
NOT THE BEST BUT NOT THE WORST I HAVE SEEN MUCH WORSE ANABASES OUT THERE

MY BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE MOST VOCAL PART OF THE INABILITY TO RESPECT EACH OPINIONS AND THAT THEY FEEL THE NEED TO MAKE THEIR OPINIONS HEARD

NOW I'M NOT GENERALIZING THE FANDOM AS A WHOLE I'M SURE THERE ARE RESPECTFUL AND REASONABLE FANS OUT THERE I'M JUST BASING IT OFF OF WHAT I'VE SEEN

EDIT EDITED THE COMMENT TO GET MY POINT ACROSS BETTER
IT IS INCREDIBLY DIVERSE ALL AGES ALL RACES ALL IDENTITIES ALL PASSION LEVELS WITH THIS DIVERSITY COMES A DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS LIKE U ELECTRIKYLE MENTIONED THERE CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE MAJOR DIVIDES IN THE FANDOM PREQUEL DISNEY LEGENDS JUST THE MOVIES VS EXPANDED MATERIAL ETC

HONESTLY MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN MIXED I HAVE MET SOME AWESOME PEOPLE SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS SHARE A PASSION WITH STAR WARS AND IT COULDN'T BE BETTER I WENT TO CELEBRATION LAST YEAR AND I TALKED TO SEVERAL PEOPLE AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO WERE VERY NICE EASILY SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE I'VE MET I'VE MET SOME AWESOME USERS HERE ON THIS SUBREDDIT EVEN SOME I DISAGREE WITH GREATLY BUT WE RESPECT EACH OTHERS OPINIONS

HOWEVER PARTICULARLY ONLINE I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE DARK SIDE OF THE FANDOM PUN INTENDED I ALMOST WANT TO SAY THERE IS A SENSE OF ABSOLUTISM YOU'RE NOT A REAL FAN IF YOU LIKE THE PREQUEL DON'T LIKE CLONE WARS OR REBELS LIKE LEGENDS ETC THERE IS AN ILLUSION THAT A POPULAR OPINION A RIGHT OPINION THE DIVERSITY OF FAN PREFERENCES SHOULD MEAN THAT ALL OPINIONS ARE RIGHT I BELIEVE STAR WARS SHOULD BE FOR EVERYONE TO TAKE AWAY WHATEVER THEY WANT FOR WHATEVER REASON DISAGREEMENTS TEND TO JUST BE CRUEL HERE AND SOME FANS CAN'T ACCEPT THAT OTHERS HOLD CONTROVERSIAL PREFERENCES

EDIT I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT I HAVE HEARD A CERTAIN PHRASE A LOT FROM FANS THAT IS ISN'T STAR WARS AS IF STAR WARS HAS A RIGID RULESET FOR WHAT THEMES ELEMENTS CAN BE INCLUDED I HATE THIS NARROW LINE OF THINKING THAT MANY FANS SEEM TO HAVE ADOPTED STAR WARS IS SO DIVERSE IN THE MATERIAL ITSELF AND THE AUDIENCE THAT I BELIEVE ANYTHING CAN BE MADE FOR STAR WARS
NOT LETTING GO OF THE EU IS A LITTLE IRRITATING THOSE WHO FEEL THAT WAY NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT'S DEAD AND MOVE ON SHAKING YOUR FIRST AT THE CLOUDS ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE MIND

I ALSO GET FRUSTRATED WITH DISNEY BEING USED AS A CURSE WORD AFL IS STILL CALLING THE SHOTS THIS IS KATHLEEN SHOW IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM COMPLAIN ABOUT HERALDRY BOB IGER JUST SIGNS THE CHECKS
PRETTY DIVISIVE AND IN MANY WAYS TOXIC
THERE ARE MANY GREAT FANS AND GROUPS BUT AS A WHOLE ARGH ON SOME FRONTS PEOPLE CLING TO IT LIKE A CULT AND THE MAJOR MEDIA REPRESENTATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN A NEGATIVE WAY AND IT TRYING TO SHOVE THOSE SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS OR LACK THEREOF OF CERTAIN PARTS IS UNFATHOMABLE
I DON'T TAKE ANYONE SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY CALL THE PREQUEL NEW MOVIES COMICS AND BOOKS NOT STAR WARS BECAUSE THAT IS SUCH A SHELTERED WAY OF THINKING AND THEY ONLY HURT THEMSELVES BY NOT SEEING OR READING SOME GREAT STUFF
PRETTY MIXED TO BE HONEST

I GREW UP HEARING ABOUT THIS MYSTICAL SPACE ADVENTURE MOVIE WHICH WAS THE BEES KNEES BUT DUE TO FACTORS OUTSIDE OF MY CONTROL THE FIRST MOVIE I SAW AS A KID WAS THE PHANTOM MENACE I SAW IT ONCE TWICE AND THEN A THIRD TIME I LIKED IT IT WAS SILLY BUT I LIKED IT A LOT STILL COULDN'T WATCH ANYTHING AT HOME SO I SAW EPISODE 2 AND WHICH I LIKED EVEN MORE DUE TO THE MORE MATURE AND MARTIAL TONE AND THE LACK OF THE PREQUEL EKWOK

IT WASN'T UNTIL YEARS LATER THAT I SAW THE ORIGINALS RIGHT AROUND THE TIME I GOT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET LETS JUST SAY MY DISAGREEING WITH THE IDEA THAT THE PREQUEL WERE GARBAGE WASN'T WELL RECEIVED BY SELF IDENTIFIED FANS OF STAR WARS THAT HAS MELLOWED SINCE THE LAST DECADE BUT ITS LEFT ITS MARK


THE THING WITH THE STAR WARS COMMUNITY IS THAT IT'S SO BIG THERE ARE TINY COMMUNITIES WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY SO THERE'S A GROUP FOR EVERYONE

THE DOWNSIDE WITH THAT IS THAT IT'S HARD TO PLEASE EVERYONE WITH THE BRAND SO MANY PEOPLE ARE BOUND TO HAVE CLASHING OPINIONS

I THINK OVERALL IT'S A DECENT COMMUNITY EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE MULTIPLE GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT I DISAGREE WITH

THE ALLIANCE OF STAR WARS FANATICS DEDICATED TO CHANGING THE FANDOM FOR THE BETTER LOOK US UP
I'VE GENERALLY FOUND ITS ONE OF THE BETTER ANABASES THERE ARE SOME REALLY WEIRD OUT THERE LIKE I'LL SEND YOU DEATH THREATS IF YOU CREATE SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE WEIRD

THERE ARE SOME ANNOYING FACTIONS HOWEVER

THERE IS THE GROUP I CALL THE TRUE STAR WARS FANS THE ONES THAT GO ABOUT IF YOU LIKED X YOU ARE A CASUAL IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE Y YOU AREN'T A FAN

EVERYONE LIKES DIFFERENT THINGS AND THAT IS OKAY IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU ANY LESS OF A STAR WARS FAN THAN THE NEXT GUY OVER


EVERYONE REPEATS THE SAME SENTIMENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVERYONE THINKS THEY'RE ORIGINAL
IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BETTER FANDOMS BUT THAT COMPARING MY OPINION TO MY EXPERIENCE TRACKS WITH OLDER FANDOMS THERE ARE SIMPLY MORE MATURE FANS AND THEY DON'T TOLERATE THE SAME LEVELS OF IMMATURITY THAT YOUNGER FANDOMS DO SO YOU GET LESS DRAME THOUGHT THE DRAMA YOU DO GET IS OFTEN DEEPER MORE COMPLICATED

WHICH ISN'T TO SAY THERE AREN'T FANS WHO ARE DICKS BUT THEY ARE SHUNNED BY THE REST OF THE FAN COMMUNITY
WELL THE WORST PART OF ANY MEDIA FRANCHISE IS THE FANS UNFORTUNATELY FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN HERE THE FANS ARE EXTREMELY NITPICKY AND IT'S NOT AT ALL ENDEARING IT DOESN'T SHOW GREAT DEVOTION AND PASSION FOR STAR WARS INSTEAD IT SHOWS THAT THEY USE STAR WARS AS A CRUTCH FOR THEIR LIVES INSTEAD OF AN OUTLET SOMETHING THEY USE AS AN ESCAPE BUT WHEN A PLEB OR A NEB COMES ALONG AND GETS SOMETHING WRONG THEY ARE VICIOUSLY ATTACKED AND THAT TURNS ME OFF TO THE FANDOM THEY ARE TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR TIME MONEY AND EMOTIONAL INVESTMENT IN SW FROM THE MAINSTREAMERS AND THAT SHOWS GREED

STAR WARS IS COOL AND IT'S FUN TO THINK ABOUT AND RESEARCH BUT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OWN VIEWS AND THINGS THEY LIKE ABOUT IT IT'S ALSO FUN TO INTERPRET STAR WARS BASED ON ONE'S UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE AND EXPERIENCES SO NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EXACT AND MOVIE ACCURATE TO BE ENJOYED
THAT WAS GREAT IN FFA SHOWING HOW BIG SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE LIKE WHEN MILLENNIUM FALCON FLEW INTO SUPER STAR DESTROYER IT JUST SHOWS HOW BIG AND SCARY THOSE ARE
DEATH STAR IS IN DIAMETER

ARE LONG

ARE KM LONG
SIZE MATTERS NOT LOOK AT ME JUDGE ME BY MY SIZE DO YOU
Q STAR WARS SHIP SIZE COMPARISON CHART

SORRY I HAD TO
THE MUSIC AND THE ACTING FOR SURE THEN GOING DEEPER INTO IT THE WORDBUILDING AND THE STORY
HONESTLY DARTH VADER WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I LIKED HIM OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE HE'S THE BADASS VILLAIN BUT AS TIME WENT ON AND REMATCHES ACCRUED I REALIZED HOW TRULY CONFLICTED ANAKIN VADER WAS THROUGH OUT THE SERIES AND MADE HIS STORY INCREASINGLY RELATABLE
I LIKE THE WORDBUILDING MYSELF THE POTLINES AND CHARACTERS AND EFFECTS CAN SEEM KIND OF TRITE SINCE THEY'VE BEEN REPEATED SO OFTEN NOW AND THE ADDITIONAL STUFF HAS VARYING QUALITY BUT THE UNIVERSE IS SO FASCINATING TO ME WITH THE UNLIMITED POTENTIAL FOR SO MUCH MORE TO BE FOUNDATION

THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME COMING BACK PLUS THE OT AND FFA ARE GOOD MOVIES
I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT WAS A PART OF MY LIFE SINCE I WAS A VERY LITTLE KID I REMEMBER SEEING THE FIRST MOVIE IN THE THEATER SURE MANY OF THE ELEMENTS IN THE MOVIE ARE SIMPLISTIC BLACK-AND-WHITE BUT IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A TYPE OF MOVIE IT'S DESIGNED TO JUST BE ABSORBED AND IS DESIGNED TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO CHILDREN

SHOULD YOU LEARN TO LOVE IT I MEAN I WOULDN'T FORCE IT ON YOURSELF IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU DON'T LIKE IT NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND WANTING TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING BIG IN CULTURE AND SOCIETY BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT LOTS OF BIG POPULAR THINGS I DON'T LIKE AND SOMETIMES I FEEL LEFT OUT OR LIKE I AM MISSING SOMETHING BUT I CAN'T FORCE MYSELF TO LIKE SOMETHING I DON'T
HONESTLY I LOVE THAT IT'S NOT PERFECT I LIKE THAT CERTAIN FRANCHISES FEEL CONCLUSIVE AND NEARLY PERFECT LIKE LORD OF THE RINGS OR HARRY POTTER BUT BECAUSE OF THAT THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING LEFT TO WONDER ABOUT OR DISCUSSION THEY FEEL SO FINAL AND YEAH THEY'VE EXPANDED ON THEM WITH THE HOBBIT AND FANTASTIC BEASTS BUT THOSE ARE JUST DIFFERENT STORIES WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT CHARACTERS YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO COMPARE THEM TOO MUCH TO WHAT CAME BEFORE

WITH STAR WARS I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THERE'S SUCH A DIVIDE IN THE FANDOM WITH THE PREQUEL I'VE NEVER VIEWED THEM AS BEING REALLY GOOD MOVIES MYSELF BUT I STILL WATCH THEM ANNUALLY IN APPRECIATION FOR WHAT THEY DO FOR THE MYTHOLOGY AND STORY AS A WHOLE

WITH THAT SAID THIS WHOLE SAGA IS MORE THAN JUST A SET OF MOVIES TO ME THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPERFECTIONS IT JUST FEELS LIKE THIS HUGE WORLD THAT I NEVER WANT TO LEAVE EVEN IF THERE IS POOR DIALOGUE OR POOR ACTING OR A REALLY BIZARRE SPECIAL EFFECT HERE AND THERE

MANY PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE FORCE AWAKENS FEELING TOO FAMILIAR BUT I'VE HONESTLY ALWAYS LOVED THE SYMMETRY THE SERIES HAS ALWAYS HAD IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE DESTINY IS A REAL THING IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE AND FOR THE SKYWALKER FAMILY

I'VE DONE SEVERAL POSTS ON STAR WARS AT LENGTH THAT WOULD DEFINITELY ANSWER THIS QUESTION EVEN FURTHER

TAG
I ACTUALLY LIKE THE BLACK AND WHITE NATURE OF IT ALL IT'S A THROW BACK TO A MORE SIMPLISTIC WAY OF STORYTELLING WHERE THE HEROES ARE GOOD AND THE VILLAINS ARE EVIL THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT GOING ON UNDER THE SURFACE IN THE FILMS AND I THINK THAT ALLOWS FOR A MORE PURE ADVENTURE STORY

I ALSO LIKE THAT IT'S NOT A COMPLEX STORY WITH MULTI FACETED CHARACTERS IT'S BIG AND DUMB AND DOESN'T ASK MUCH OF THE AUDIENCE IT'S JUST A FUN RIDE WITH FUN CHARACTERS

AND FINALLY I LIKE THE LORE I GREW UP READING STAR WARS ENCYCLOPEDIAS AND LOVED READING ABOUT EVERY LITTLE DETAIL THAT WAS JAMMED IN THERE IT'S ALL KIND OF USELESS AND NEVER REALLY ADDS TO THE MOVIES BUT IT WAS SO DAMN FUN TO READ

FINALLY DON'T WORRY IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU DON'T HAVE TOO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME TRYING TO ENJOY SOMETHING THAT ISN'T FOR YOU THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS YOU COULD BE DOING
HONESTLY THERE IS SO MUCH I LOVE ABOUT STAR WARS IT IS HARD TO PIN POINT ONE THING BUT IF I HAD TO IT WOULD BE THE HEROICS OF STAR WARS THE TALES ABOUT A VALIANT HERO SAVINGS UNKNOWN AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE IS ALWAYS ENJOYABLE TO ME
THE SHIPS AND ALIENS I WAS HOOKED AS A KID THE MOMENT THAT IND STARTED GOING BY IN EPISTLE IV THE CANTINA SCENE WITH ALL THE ALIENS PRETTY MUCH SEALED MY INTEREST IN THE SERIES THAT'S ALSO WHY RETURN OF THE JEDI WAS FOR A LONG TIME MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY YOU HAD TIE INTERCEPTORS AND THE REBEL FLEET INTRODUCED ALIENS ACTIVE IN THE REBELLION AND THE ASSORTED MOB AT WERE AWESOME TO SEE NOT TO MENTION THE FALCON BECAME A CHARACTER IN HER OWN RIGHT DURING THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK WITH ALL HER QUIRKS AND TRAILS SHE ENDURED HECK I FIND THE FALCON MORE RELATABLE THAN SOME OF THE CHARACTERS IN UNIVERSE HAVING WORKED ON YEAR OLD AIRCRAFT FOR ALMOST A DECADE NOW

AS FOR WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU INTERESTED IN THE NEXT TWO STAR WARS STORY MOVIES I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ROGUE ONE AS THAT SEEMS TO BE YOUR AVERAGE ODDBALL SQUAD TAKING IT TO THE EVIL REGIME WAR STORY TO ME BUT HAN SOLO COULD BE INTERESTING AS HE ORIGINALLY WAS THE AMORAL SCOUNDREL THAT EVENTUALLY CAME AROUND TO SUPPORT THE REBELLION HIS BACK STORY COULD BE A LOT LESS BLACK AND WHITE IF THEY GET INTO THE LESS GLAMOROUS ELEMENTS OF SMUGGLING WITH HAN AND THE SEEDIER SIDE OF GAMBLING WITH LANDO
HE MENTIONS IT IN THE CRYSTAL CRISIS ARC ON BUT NOT IN THE LOST MISSIONS SEASON
WAIT FOR THE RAMP MORTY THEY LOVE THE SLOW RAMP IT REALLY GETS THEIR DICKS HARD WHEN THEY SEE THIS RAMP
IMPERIAL SHUTTLE ENTRANCES TURN ME ON THAT IS ALL
POWWAH
OF COURSE KRENNIC WOULD HAVE A CUSTOM DESIGNED IMPERIAL SHIP INSTEAD OF JUST USING A STANDARD SHUTTLE AFTER READING CATALYST IT BECAME APPARENT THAT HE IS SO FULL OF HIMSELF THAT HE THINKS HE'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO EVEN GET AWAY WITH WEARING A FUCKING WHITE CAPE
SHIT THAT SHIP LOOKS LIKE IT'S FRONT DOOR
I NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU GOT THIS PICTURE
HIS SHUTTLE LOOKS LIKE THAT TOMB IN NEW ORLEANS THAT NICK CAGE OWNS
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF SHIP FROM ALIEN OR DUNE
GIVE ME SMOKE MORE SMOKE
I THINK KRENNIC NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING A BIG SHUTTLE WON'T MAKE GALEN LEAVE LYRA FOR HIM
NOT A FAN OF HAVING SOME IMPERIAL WITH A CUSTOM MADE BLACK IMPERIAL SHUTTLE BUT HAVING THE EMPEROR OF THE GALAXY USE THE NORMAL ONE
WALKER WALKING TESTING TESTS
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT
I'M NOT EXPECTING IT TO FOR A FEW REASONS

THE FORCE AWAKENS WAS THE FIRST FILM IN OVER A DECADE

2 IT WAS THE FIRST SEQUEL TO STAR WARS IN MY LIFETIME

IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW THE ORIGINAL TRIO ON THE BIG SCREEN

IT WAS THE CONTINUATION OF THE MAIN STAR WARS SAGA

ROGUE ONE DOESN'T REALLY FULFIL THAT CRITERIA
SEEING VADER ON THE BIG SCREEN WILL GIVE ME GOOSEBUMPS FOR SURE IF HE HAS LARGER ROLE THAN I'M ANTICIPATING THEN MY GOOSEBUMPS WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE FILM
HONESTLY IF THEY DO THE OLD SIMPLE DEATH STAR THEME FROM ANH WHEN THEY SHOW THE DEATH STAR IN ROGUE ONE I WILL GET THE BIGGEST CHILLS

I MISS THAT SHORT CUE
UNPOPULAR OPINION WHILE BEING ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF THE YEAR FFA WASN'T EVERYTHING I EXPECTED THERE WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH NOSTALGIA FOR MY LIKING
I'M FAR MORE HYPED FOR ROGUE ONE
I'M EXPECTING IT TO GIVE ME A FEW DURING THE LARGE RIGHT SCENES THE TRAILERS HAVE HAD ME ABSOLUTELY GIDDY WITH EXCITEMENT
I'M JUST GONNA CHEER FOR THE LUCASFILM LOGO AS SOON AS IT COMES ON FUCKWIT I DID WORSE WHEN I SAW IT IN FFA
PROBABLY WHEN VADER SHOWS UP
EH I FOUND MYSELF THINKING JUST AROUND THE PART WHERE HAN AND FINN WERE CAPTURED ON TAKADONA EH THIS FEELS LIKE A FANATIC AND INCREDIBLY WELL-DONE FANATIC BUT A FANATIC NONETHELESS

I AM INCREDIBLY HYPED FOR ROGUE ONE ON THE OTHER HAND
EVERY TRAILER ALREADY HAS GIVEN ME GOOSEBUMPS HOWEVER EPISODE GAVE ME NOTHING BUT MISERY SO YEAH
I HAD NO EP SHIVERS OR EP SHIVERS OR ANY OTHER SHIVERS LET'S NOT GO CRAZY
TL R BREZNICAN WAS ON THE NEWEST REBEL FORCE RADIO POD AND SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING WITH HIM IN A STANDALONE FILM UNTIL THEY SAW HOW THE STORY IN THE TRILOGY PANNED OUT BECAUSE THERE MAY BE CONNECTIONS THEY WOULD WANT TO MAKE BETWEEN THE TWO

THIS COULD MEAN SOMETHING OR IT COULD MEAN NOTHING BECAUSE THE STORY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN FINALIZED FOR WHEN THIS WAS THE THOUGHT AT LUCASFILM
IT'S BECAUSE LUCASFILM IS PLANNING STAR WARS A HONDO ONAKA STORY FACE THE TRUTH SHEEPLET
IF IS INVOLVED IN AND THE HYPE TRAIN WOULD OVERLOAD

DISNEY WOULD BE INSANE TO NOT CASH IN ON A KENOBI SOLO MOVIE WHILE MCGREGOR CAN STILL PLAY HIM FOR THE NEXT DECADE OR SO
I WANT A EWAN MCGREGOR OBI WAN MOVIE A TIMES MORE THAN I WANT A HARRISON HAN SOLO FILM
RUMORED IS THE REASON I'M NOT PAYING THIS MUCH HEED THE NUMBER OF STAR WARS RUMORS FLOATING AROUND THIS GREAT WEB OF OURS COULD FILL A STAR CRUISER
ALTHOUGH BREZNICAN IS A PRETTY GOOD SOURCE LETS KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS SPECULATION ON HIS PART AND HE'S BEEN WRONG BEFORE HE APPEARED ON THE SAME PODCAST BEFORE FFA CAME OUT AND SAID THAT THE DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD KILL HAN IN THE FIRST MOVIE OF THE NEW TRILOGY
CAN WE GET EWAN IN LUKES FORCE COUNCIL PLEASE
I JUST REALLY WANT TO SEE AN STANDALONE FILM WHERE IT'S BASICALLY TRAINSPOTTING IN THE DUNE SEA OF TATTOOING KENOBI HAS JUST OVERLOADED ON SHIMS AND DEATH STICKS HE HAS A SET OF FRIENDS THAT HE GOES TO THE CANTINA WITH LIKE THE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS FROM TRAINSPOTTING GETTING INTO BAR FIGHTS AND THE LIKE

WOULD I WANT IT TO BE CANON HELL NUMBER BUT I WOULD WATCH IT CAUSE IT'D BE HILARIOUS
HOPEFULLY EWAN MCGREGOR AND HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN SHOW UP AS FORCE GHOSTS IN VIII OR IX
LUKE DIES IN SHOWS UP AS A FORCE GHOST WITH AS PLAYED BY A SUITABLY AGED EWAN MCGREGOR
PLEASE BE TRUE OBI WAN IS MY FAVORITE HUMAN CHARACTER I ESPECIALLY LOVED EWAN MCGREGOR AS OBI WAN

IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE
I WANT AN OLDER EWAN MCGREGOR MOVIE AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY BUT I'M CURIOUS WHAT EXACTLY WOULD THE STORY BE ABOUT HE BASICALLY JUST CHILLED ON TATTOOING AND WATCHED LUKE RIGHT ARE THERE ANY CANON COMICS THAT TOUCH ON WHAT HE DID DURING THAT TIME I'D LIKE TO READ THEM IF THERE ARE
WELL THEY'RE DONE FILMING VIII SO HE'S NOT IN VIII I REALLY THINK ORIGINS WILL ALREADY BE OUT IN THIS MOVIE BECAUSE THE LAST ONE WILL BE ONE BIG WAR FIGHT SCENE SO I REALLY REALLY DOUBT HE'S IN THIS TRILOGY
THAT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE BUT THEN AGAIN WHO WOULD PLAY FORCE GHOST THE ONLY TIME WE SEE HIS FORCE GHOST IS IN EMPIRE AND ROTC OBVIOUSLY SO IT'S NOT LIKE MCGREGOR COULD DO IT
MAKES NO SENSE USE EM IN NEW OBI MATERIAL TO MAKE IT EASIER TO USE HIM IN SAGA FILMS
GENERAL KENOBI WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU
I HAVEN'T BEEN KEEPING UP WITH THE CURRENT SEASON OF REBELS BUT I HAVE HEARD THAT KENOBI WILL LIKELY BE IN IT PERHAPS THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT
I CALL THAT EWAN PUBLICLY SAYING HE'D LOVE TO DO AN MOVIE WAS A MISDIRECT AND HE'LL PROBABLY POP UP SOMEWHERE AS A FORCE GHOST OR A FLASHBACK OR SOMETHING
THEY'LL DO IT EVENTUALLY MCGREGOR IS STILL YOUNG HE'S IN HIS MID S THE GREAT SIR ALEC WAS ALREADY IN HIS S WHEN ANH CAME OUT

IF ANYTHING WAITING MORE YEARS WOULD MAKE HIS PORTRAYAL SEEM MORE REALISTIC AGE WISE
THIS ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE I HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH MY FRIEND RECENTLY THAT DISNEY AREN'T STUPID AND THERE HAS TO BE A GOOD REASON IT'S NOT HAPPENING AT THIS POINT I GENUINELY COULDN'T THINK OF A REASON NOT TO PUSH THAT MOVIE OUT BUT THIS IS AN ALRIGHT EXCUSE THEY HAVE THE ACTOR THAT EVERYONE LOVES FOR BEING THE BEST PART OF THE PREQUEL PUSHING FOR IT TO GET MADE THE CHARACTER IS BELOVED AND EXTREMELY WELL-KNOWN THE FANS ARE RALLYING AND PUSHING FOR THE FILM WHAT POSSIBLE REASON WAS THERE TO NOT RELEASE IT

BUT THIS THIS SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL THAT HE'LL PLAY A PART IN THE NEW TRILOGY EITHER AS A FORCE GHOST OR IN FLASHBACKS OR SOMETHING I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T OVERDO IT FINISH HIS STORY TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIS MYSTERIOUS PAST BETWEEN III AND IV MAYBE EVEN THE REY KENOBI THEORISTS WILL GET THEIR WAY THEN SHOW US HIS PAST IN THE STANDALONE IF THEY WERE TO GO DOWN THE KENOBI ROUTE FOR REY WHICH HONESTLY I KINDA HOPE THEY DON'T THEY WOULD NEED TO HAVE A SHORT SCENE EXPLAINING IT TO HER IN VIII THEN FINISH THE TRILOGY AND RELEASE KENOBI IN TO GIVE US MORE DETAIL ON WHO HE LOVED WHO WAS HIS SON DAUGHTER ETC
MAUL GOES TO TATTOOING TO KILL AND DISCOVERS HE'S BEEN PROTECTING THE SON OF THE CHOSEN ONE AND KIDNAPS LUKE BEN GOES AFTER THEM BUT SO DO THE BUTTS AND THEIR HIRED HELP BUZ THEY HATE MAUL BEN AND MAUL JOIN FORCES TO DEFEAT ALL BUT ONE OF THE BUTTS THOUGH NOT BEFORE MAUL SACRIFICES HIMSELF TO SAVE THE NEW HOPE FINALLY REALIZING HIS WAY HAS BEEN WRONG ALL ALONG BEN BRINGS LUKE BACK TO OWEN WHO LOSES HIS MIND THAT LUKE WAS A PART OF ALL THIS BEN JEDI MIND TRICKS LUKE INTO FORGETTING WHAT JUST HAPPENED BEN RIDES OFF IN TO THE SUNSET OWEN FLIPS HIM OFFICIAL ROLL CREDITS
I BELIEVE WITH MY HEART THAT REY IS OBI GRAND DAUGHTER SHE'S THE OFF SPRING OF THE SON DAUGHTER OF THE UNION BETWEEN OBI AND DUCHESS SATINE
THEY'RE REMAKING THE PREQUEL YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST EPISODE I IN
WAIT UNTILL THE NEW YEAR THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WILL BE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT IN JANUARY SPECULATION IS THAT ITS EITHER THE BOBA FETT STAND ALONE OR THE OBI WAN STAND ALONE
WISE DECISION SO FAR THERE WOULD NOT A LOT OF STORY TO TELL ABOUT 2 HOURS FILM ABOUT EXILE IN DESERT WITH NO PEOPLE OCCASIONAL HELING LUKE TO SURVIVE
THERE WILL BE NO STANDALONE MOVIE BECAUSE HIS STORY WAS ALREADY SO HEAVILY EXHAUSTED THAT ONLY HIS PADAWANSHIP AND EXILE REMAIN SECOND ONE WOULD BE BORING AS HELL WHILE FIRST ONE WOULD REQUIRE CASTING YOUNGER VERSIONS OF MANY ACTORS KNOWN FROM PT WHICH WOULD RESULTED IN DECREASED QUALITY OF THE MOVIE WAY BEFORE SHOOTING EVEN STARTS

THEY SHOULD DO MOVIE FROM YEARS BEFORE PART IT WOULDN'T DESTROY HIS MYSTERIOUS PAST AS HE WAS ALREADY OLD THEN AND WE WOULD GET WHOLE NEW SETTING
IT ALSO FEELS LIKE DISNEY JUST WRITHES AT THE NOTION OF ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY TIED TO THE PREQUEL TRILOGY ERA IT MAKES THEIR FLESH SEAR

WHICH RIGHTEOUSLY PISSES ME OFF SEEING AS EVEN IF THE PREQUEL WEREN'T THAT EXCELLENT OF MOVIES THE UNIVERSE THEY WERE ESTABLISHED IN WAS STILL VERY INTERESTING AND FILLED WITH INTRIGUING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STORY TELLING

AND A LOT MORE CAN BE DONE TO INCREASE THE CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE PT AND OT
IS IT'S A BAD IDEA REALLY NOT ENOUGH OF A REASON
OH THIS IS BULLETIN THIS IS NO REASON TO NOT HAVE AN MOVIE
OKAY IS IT JUST ME OR IS THIS HEADLINE AWFUL CAN'T THEY JUST TITLE IT KENOBI MOVIE NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN I FEEL LIKE THE EXISTING HEADLINE JUST DOESN'T USE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE VERY WELL LOL
IF YOU'RE INTO READING DEFINITELY ADD CATALYST ONTO THE END OF THAT LIST ALTHOUGH IT STARTS DURING THE CLONE WARS SO IF YOU READ IT AT THE END THEN YOU'LL BE HAVING A BIT OF A FLASHBACK
THAT'S AN AWESOME LIST
I'LL PROBABLY WATCH A FEW OF THEM TOO
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY ADD THE UNFINISHED UTAPAU ARC OF THE CLONE WARS IN THERE AS IT REVOLVES AROUND A GIANT GYBER CRYSTAL WHICH ARE USED TO POWER THE DEATH STAR'S SUPERLASER BASED ON CATALYST IT SEEMS LIKE THEY MAY PLAY A ROLE IN ROGUE ONE AS WELL

YOU ALSO MAY WANT TO ADD BREAKING RANKS FROM REBELS AS THAT DEALS WITH THE REBELS GOING AFTER A GIANT GYBER CRYSTAL THE EMPIRE IS TRANSPORTING AND MAYBE THE HONORABLE ONES AS WELL SINCE THAT SHOWS GEOGNOSIS AND THE CONSTRUCTION MODULES ABOVE IT USED TO BUILD THE DEATH STAR
I WILL DEFINITELY BE FOLLOWING THIS LIST

MY LIST BEFORE TWO SECONDS AGO EPISODE I EPISODE II CLONE WARS LOST MISSIONS EPISODE III AND REBELS SPARK OF REBELLION WHICH IS ABOUT HOURS OF STAR WARS I'LL PROBABLY KEEP EPISODES FROM SEASON OF CLONE WARS FROM MY LIST AND TAKE OUT THE REST AND EPISODE I WATCH IT LIKE THE WEEK BEFORE INSTEAD
DON'T FORGET TO PLAY STAR WARS TOURS OF DUTY
I THINK I'LL JUST WATCH ANH THEN AGAIN I DID FINISH CATALYST ON AUDIOBOOK TWO DAYS AFTER IT CAME OUT THAT WAS A GOOD BOOK
NICE SECOND ATTEMPT
THIS WAS PRETTY CREATIVE NICE JOB
WITH EVERY BREATH VADER TAUNTS THEM WHISPERING
IT WILL BE NO MATCH AGAINST THE FORCES OF COACH COPATAINE
BOBO BOOBOO GET OFF THE HERE HAVE AN UNVOTE FOR A DAD JOKE THAT IS TRULY A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH
ROBOT CHICKEN REALLY KNOWS HOW TO TUG AT MY HEARTSTRINGS
THAT'S AWESOME
THAT'S SO COOL DID YOU PAINT IT YOURSELF
WEIRD

THEY AREN'T IN ORDER STAR WARS ASOKA COMES AFTER EPISODE III
IT'S A SHAME THAT THE ORIGINAL AND PREQUEL TRILOGY NOVELIZATIONS AREN'T CONSIDERED CANON ANYMORE THE SIDE STORIES IN PHANTOM MENACE WERE GREAT GAVE A LOT OF BACKSTORY
THIS JUST LINKS TO THE AUDIBLE HOME PAGE FOR ME
HAVE PEOPLE READ ANY OF THE NEW ONES ARE THEY ANY GOOD THE ONLY ONES I REALLY ENJOYED FROM THE OLD DAYS WERE THE MOVIE NOVELIZATIONS THE THRAWN TRILOGY KAREN CLONE COMMANDO SERIES SOME OF THE ROGUE SQUADRON BOOKS AND THAT ONE VONG BOOK THAT HAD THE CAMANSI DIPLOMAT IN IT

I HAVEN'T READ ANY OF THE NEW STUFF SUGGESTIONS RECOMMENDATIONS
I LOVE THAT IMAGE AND ROTC IS MY FAVORITE EPISODE BUT IT BOTHERS ME THAT LUKE STILL HAS BOTH HANDS

EDIT I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE HE HAD THAT FAKE SKIN PUT OVER THE ROBOT HAND STILL KINDA BUGS ME THO
I LIKE THE TRIVIA ABOUT THIS IMAGE THOSE ARE ACTUALLY GEORGE LUCAS HANDS WHO POSED FOR THIS
THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST PROMOTIONAL IMAGE I EVER SAW FOR JEDI I REMEMBER THINKING WAIT IS THAT THE DEATH STAR
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE POSTERS I HAVE THE JAPANESE VERSION
IF I'M HONEST I NEVER LIKED THIS POSTER JUST THE RATIO OF THE RECTANGLE TO THE THIN TOWER OF THE LIGHTSABER THE WEIGHT ON THE LEFT HOW THE SABER IS CUT SHORT BY THE TITLE HOW THERE'S NO GAP BETWEEN THE IMAGE AND TITLE ALWAYS BUGGED ME ALL GOOD THAT YOU LIKE IT THOUGH

THAT'S WHY I ACTUALLY LIKE THE 3D FORCE AWAKENS PACKAGING ALMOST BOUGHT IT FOR THAT ALONE
AREN'T THOSE LUCAS HANDS
HE'S PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE LEGENDS JEDI
KOTA IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WISH FU WAS RECANONIZED
AH RAHM GOOD TIME GOOD TIMES INDEED I REMEMBER THE MISSION YOU HAVE TO ESCORT HIM IN HIS DRUNKEN STUPOR WHILE HE'S BLIND STARKVILLE BEING ALL PATIENT SINCE IT'S KINDA HIS FAULT THAT KOTA WAS IN THAT STATE
WELL ITS ACTUALLY THE SECOND RESULT HETP
AS I SAID IN A PREVIOUS THREAD NOT TOO LONG AGO RAHM KOTA IS MY FAVORITE JEDI THE DUDE IS LEGENDARY BUT DOES NOT DESERVE THE LEGENDS TAG

MAKE HIM CANON FOR GOD'S SAKE
IT'D BE FUN TO HAVE KOTA BACK IN THE STORY SOMEWHERE NOT SURE WHERE YOU FIT HIM IN THOUGH YOU GET WORRIED THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE STAR WARS GALAXIES EFFECT WHERE YOU HAD A TOO MANY JEDI RUNNING AROUND IN AN ERA WHERE THERE ARE AN EXTREMELY LIMITED NUMBER
THAT'S ACTUALLY HILARIOUS
OH YEAH I REMEMBER THAT GUY
BINARY SUNSET SIGNALED THE BEGINNING OF THE GREATEST ADVENTURE EVER SEEN ON SCREEN
JUST ONCE LET ME LOOK ON YOU WITH MY OWN EYES
I AM A JEDI LIKE MY FATHER BEFORE ME
THE MOMENT WHEN VADER IS LOOKING BACK AND FORTH AT LUKE AND THE EMPEROR I'VE SEEN THE MOVIE SO MANY TIMES I CANNOT EVEN GUESS AT A NUMBER AND YET EVERY TIME I SEE THAT MOMENT IT STRETCHES FOR SO LONG AND ALTHOUGH I KNOW THE OUTCOME THE MUSIC AND THE EMOTIONAL CHARGE OF ALL THE THREE CHARACTERS MAKES ME TENSE AGAIN AND AGAIN
ONE FROM THE NEWER FILMS FOR ME IS WHEN LIGHTSABER EMERGES FROM THE SNOW AND FLIES PAST KALO AND INTO HAND WITH THE JOHN WILLIAMS FORCE THEME PLAYING IT WAS JUST EVERYTHING AWESOME ABOUT STAR WARS IN ONE SPEECHLESS MOMENT AND WAS THE MOST EXCITING MOMENT IN EP FOR ME

BUT AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THE THRONE ROOM BINARY SUNSET AND I AM YOUR FATHER TOP EVERYTHING IMO
THRONE ROOM DUEL
SEEING ANAKIN WHO BOWED TO NO ONE KNEEL IN SUBMISSION TO DARTH SIMIOUS TIED FOR FIRST IN MY MIND WHEN IT COME TO EMOTIONALLY MOVING SCENES IN ANY MOVIE THE OTHER IS WHEN THE CAJUN PRISONER IS ELECTROCUTED DRY IN THE GREEN MILE

THAT SCENE AND THE DUEL ON MUSTAFAR ARE THE REASONS THAT IS MY FAVORITE SW MOVIE
WHEN LUKE SNAPS AS VADER IS TAUNTING HIM AND JUST STARTS WAILING ON HIM THE ENTIRE THRONE ROOM SEQUENCE REALLY

NO I AM YOUR FATHER

KALO AND HAN ON THE BRIDGE
THE MOMENT YODA BRINGS THE OUT OF THE SWAMP IS A GREAT ONE IT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE BEST

THE THRONE ROOM DUEL MIGHT BE TIED WITH THAT IN MY BOOK
FOR ME IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE FIGHT IN CLOUD CITY BETWEEN LUKE AND VADER IN EMPIRE WHILE THE REBELS AND EMPIRE ARE TEARING EACH OTHER APART OUTSIDE THE REAL FATE OF THE GALAXY IS BEING DETERMINED BY A SWORD FIGHT BETWEEN FATHER AND SON BENEATH A CITY TO NO SPECTATORS

THE FIGHT IN JEDI IS ALSO GREAT BUT THE FACT THAT IT'S IN THE DEATH STAR WITH PALATINE WATCHING MAKES IT A LITTLE TOO ON THE NOSE THAT FIGHT ON BESPIN JUST PERFECTLY REPRESENTS THE HEART OF THE SERIES FOR ME
WHEN KALO REN STOPS THE BLASTER BOLT AND KEEPS IT THERE THROUGH THE ENTIRE ENCOUNTER WITH POE

AWESOME MOMENT THE BEST
WHEN THE DIVE TO BEGIN THE ATTACK ON THE DEATH STAR IN EPISTLE IV THE WAY THE MUSIC BUILDS UP AS THEY FLY FROM BAVIN AND THEN SWELLS AS THEY DIVE STILL GIVES ME CHILLS

WHEN REY PULLS THE LIGHT SABER FROM THE SNOW IN FFA AND THE CUE FROM BURNING HOMESTEAD KICKS IN IS DEFINITELY UP THERE AS WELL
REDEMPTION IS PROBABLY MY TOP SERIOUS MOMENT BUT THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER SCENES THAT ARE FUNNY AS FUCK GOOD JOB CRACKS ME UP EVERY TIME AND THERE'S A LOT OF HAN SOLO MOMENTS THAT ARE GREAT I THINK MY FAVORITE IS ON THE DEATH STAR WHEN HE CHASES A FEW STORM-TROOPER DOWN A HALL SCREAMING AND THEN COMES AROUND A CORNER AND RUNS INTO LIKE MORE
THE I AM YOUR FATHER MOMENT

THE THRONE ROOM DUEL

ASOKA VS VADER

BUT MY FAVOURITE IS PROBABLY HAN AND KALO ON THE BRIDGE IT'S SO TENSE AND WELL-ACTED IT REALLY CEMENTED KALO AS A GREAT STAR WARS VILLAIN TO ME


BEST MOMENT

WHEN VADER FINALLY FULFILLED HIS DESTINY AND THREW THE EMPEROR TO HIS DEATH BRINGING BALANCE TO THE FORCE BY DESTROYING THE SITH AT LEAST UNTIL DISNEY CAME ALONG

COOLEST MOMENT

REY KALO LIGHTSABER FIGHT HONESTLY I'VE SEEN DOZENS OF TIMES NOW AND THAT FIGHT STILL AMAZES ME THE CINEMATOGRAPHY THE SOUND THE FX EVERYTHING IT'S JUST ASTOUNDINGLY COOL
MAYBE NOT THE GREATEST MOMENT IN HISTORY BUT ITS WHEN I KNEW SHIT WAS ABOUT TO GO DOWN

YOU DONT NEED TO SEE HIS IDENTIFICATION

WE DONT NEED TO SEE HIS IDENTIFICATION
FOR ME AND I KNOW IT'S THE BIGGEST CLICH OF ALL CLICHES BUT LUKE LEARNING WHO HIS FATHER IS

I DISCOVERED STAR WARS IN MY LATE HAD HEARD ALL THE SPOILERS AND WHAT NOT BUT STILL THAT STRUCK ME VERY VERY DEEPLY IN A WAY I WASN'T PREPARED AFTER INVESTING MYSELF INTO THE FRANCHISE

IF YOU WILL IS LUKE AND FINAL CONVERSATION SO MANY WHAT IFS AND HOLY DAMN IMAGINE WHAT THEY COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED HAD THAT HAPPENED EARLIER
I LOVE YOU
I KNOW

OR WHEN HAN SAYS HEY IT'S ME ON ENDOR
THE BEGINNING OF ROTS WITH THE BATTLE OVER CORUSCANT SO GOOD

DEFINITELY NOT THE BEST BUT THE MOST ICONIC TO ME I KNEW SHIT WAS ABOUT TO GO DOWN AS SOON AS I SAW THAT HUGE BATTLE GOING ON
I SEE MOST POSTS MENTION SOMETHING IN THE FILMS TO ME ONE OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS WAS SEEING THAT FIRST TEASER FOR PHANTOM MENACE TOOK ME HOURS TO DOWNLOAD OH WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN
ITS A TIE BETWEEN HAN BEING FROZEN IN CARBONITE AND THE END OF ESB WHEN FIXES THE HYPER DRIVE OF THE FALCON AND SHE JUMPS TO LIGHTSPEED FANTASTIC MUSIC EXCELLENT BUILD UP AND PAY OFFICIAL ESB AS A WHOLE IS JUST CLASSIC CINEMA

I AM THE SENATE
THE RUMINATION SCENE WAS PRETTY GOOD
LUKE LANDING BACK ON THE SALE BARGE CATCHING HIS LIGHTSABER AND IGNITING IT
IN REAL LIFE MAY

IN UNIVERSE EXPLAINING THE FORCE TO LUKE HAD THAT MEETING NEVER OCCURRED EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT
THE SCENE THAT HAS ALWAYS CAUGHT ME IS WHEN VADER INTERRUPTS HIETT AND OUZEL OVER WHAT THE PROBE DROID FOUNDATION THE JOCKEYING FOR AUTHORITY AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN VADER COMES UP AND JAMES EARL JONES VOICE JUST SAYS THAT'S IT WITH SUCH CONVICTION
THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE THE PREQUEL FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE THE SEQUELS
IN UNIVERSE REDEMPTION

OUT OF UNIVERSE A QUIRKY SCI-FI FAIRYTALE SPACE OPERA WITH TROUBLED PRODUCTION SELLING OUT THEATERS AND BECOMING A SURPRISE HIT KICKING OFF A FRANCHISE
TRENCH RUN SEQUENCE
AS FOR EMOTIONAL HAN SOLO BEING FROZEN DEATH HAN DIES IN FFA

AS FOR HILARITY HAND BEING CUT OFF LUKE BEING ELECTROCUTED IT'S A TRAP C INTERRUPTING HAN AND REUNION WITH HELLO C YELLING I'M OVER HEEEERE TO GET THE ATTENTION
ESB ASTEROID FIELD THE MUSIC AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS THE DIALOGUE IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST QUINTESSENTIAL STAR WARS SCENES I FEEL LIKE THE ASTEROID SCENE TOGETHER WITH THE SCENE WHERE YODA RAISES FROM THE SWAMP PERFECTLY EXPLAIN THE ESSENCE OF THE STAR WARS PHENOMENA

THE THIRD TRAILER FOR FFA IS ALSO ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOMENTS THE MUSIC PLUS HAN SOLO THE ULTIMATE SCEPTIC ADMITTING THAT THE FORCE IS REAL IS PURE MAGIC

I ALSO REALLY LIKE THE EXPOSITION SCENE IN ANH INSIDE HUT

BINARY SUNSET IN STAR WARS OR LUKE VS VADER IN THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK BOTH ARE DEFINING MOMENTS IN FILM HISTORY
REY CATCHING THE LIGHTSABER OR THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN LUKE AND VADER AT THE END OF ROTC
I PERSONALLY REALLY LOVE THE ENTIRE ABBA SAIL BARGE SEQUENCE WITH LUKE AND ALSO REALLY ENJOY THE SEQUENCE IN FFA WHEN THE OWINGS COME SOARING IN ACROSS THE LAKE ON TAKODANA
THE FORCE IS WITH YOU YOUNG SKYWALKER
T

LUKE VS VADER ROTC

FINALLY GETTING TO THE MOMENT WE ALL WAITED FOR AS KIDS

LUKE FACING HIS FATHER AND APPROACHING THE EMP FOR THE FIRST TIME

NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS

IT REALLY SUMS UP THE ENTIRE SAGA IN ONE LINE EVERYTHING THE REBELS ARE DOING IS SO OUTLANDISH THEY'RE A LOOSE ALLIANCE OF SMUGGLERS AND POLITICAL DISSIDENTS FIGHTING A GALACTIC EMPIRE THE SCALE IS UNFATHOMABLE WHO HAVE A WEAPON CAPABLE OF DESTROYING PLANETS AND YET IN THE END THE FORCE WILLS IT AND THEY WIN
THE FORCE IS WITH YOU YOUNG SKYWALKER BUT YOU ARE NOT A JEDI YET

WHEN GONE AM I THE LAST OF THE JEDI YOU WILL BE

THESE ARE YOUR FIRST STEPS

THE CHANCE OF SEEING EWAN RETURN AS EXCITES ME EVEN IF IT MAY NEVER HAPPEN
A TIE BETWEEN VADER AND LUKE FIGHTING ON CLOUD CITY AND THEM FIGHTING ON DEATH STAR I GREW UP WITH THE PREQUEL AND LOVED THE ENERGY AND THE FLIPPING AND WILDNESS OF LIGHTSABER BATTLES I USED TO SAY THAT THEY PUT THE ORIGINALS TO SHAME THEN I GREW UP YOU DON'T NEED THOSE ACROBATICS IN THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY IN THE OT EVERY TIME A LIGHTSABER WAS LIT A MAJOR DECISION WAS ABOUT TO BE MADE THE FIRST ONE IN A NEW HOPE IS STILL A LITTLE SKETCHY BUT OVERALL OT LIGHTSABER DUELS WERE DRIPPING WITH INTENSITY AND EMOTION I LOVE THEM
BEST SCENE IN ALL OF STAR WARS

CODAS THEME EASY TOP IN THE ENTIRE SAGA

THE MUSIC THE QUOTES THE TEARS

I'LL ADD THAT THE ENDING OF EPISTLE IS A REALLY COOL SCENE WITH ZERO DIALOGUE AS WELL YOUNG PRODIGY CLIMBING THE STEPS UP TO THE OLD JEDI MASTER TOPPED WITH A GREAT SCORE BY THE MAN HIMSELF GOOD STUFF JUST REMOVE THE AWKWARD HELICOPTER SHOT AND IT WOULD BEEN PERFECT
ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOMENTS IS WHEN THE REBEL FIGHTERS MAKE THEIR APPROACH TO THE FIRST DEATH STAR IN THE BATTLE OF BAVIN THE TENSION IN THE SOUNDTRACK AS THEY FLY THEIR SCANT SHIPS AT THE MASSIVE BASE
THE FIRST TIME I WATCHED THE OT AS I'D SAY YRS OLD IN ROTC WHEN LUKE NODS TO RIGHT BEFORE HE'S ABOUT TO HAND ABBAS CREW THEIR ASSES MORE SO THE JUMP DOWN OFF THE DIVING BOARD AND CATCH THE LIGHT SABER
THE FIGHT SCENE IN THE THRONE ROOM AT THE END OF ROTC IT'S PRETTY MUCH PERFECT TO ME
REDEMPTION
THE REDEMPTION OF VADER
GODHOOD YOUR HATE HAS MADE YOU POWERFUL NOW FULFILL YOUR DESTINY AND TAKE YOUR FATHER'S PLACE AT MY SIDE

NEVER THROWS AWAY LIGHTSABER I'LL NEVER TURN TO THE DARK SIDE
REVEAL AND THE END OF EPISODE ENTIRELY
PREQUEL DARTH MAUL IGNITING HIS SECOND BLADE

ORIGINALS FOR ME A TIE BETWEEN THE BINARY SUNSET AND THE VERY SHOT WHERE THE BEGIN THEIR DESCENT TO THE DEATH STAR SO SIMPLE BUT IT JUST REALLY DOES IT FOR ME

SEQUELS SO FAR OBVIOUSLY A TIE BETWEEN REY DRIVING HER SPEEDER THROUGH THE WRECKAGE OF THE OLD BATTLE SIGNIFYING HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED SINCE THE EMPIRE THE GREATEST POWER IN THE GALAXY AND THE JEDI STEPS
MINE IS FROM THE WORST MOVE EPISODE 2 THE STADIUM WHEN THE JEDI SHOW UP
THE MOMENT FADME DIED FROM A BROKEN HEART
DAMN
HEY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
EDITING ALREADY WTF THIS IS AMAZING
IT'S REALLY NUTS HOW MUCH TIME THEY HAVE
IF EZRA SAVES HIM I'LL BE PISSED
YOU KNOW IT OCCURS TO ME THAT A HUGE CHUNK OF OUR ARGUMENTS ABOUT THRAWN COULD HAVE BEEN NULLIFIED IF THEY'D JUST DONE ONE THING IN HIS VERY FIRST EPISODE

IN THE VERY FIRST CHAPTER OF THE VERY FIRST BOOK OF THE EU THRAWN ELIMINATED AN ENTIRE NEW REPUBLIC FLEET BY EXECUTING A STAR DESTROYER OF DEATH WHILE RELAXING IN HIS ROOM DRINKING A BEER AFTER THAT IT KINDA DIDN'T MATTER THAT IT WOULD TAKE ALMOST THE ENTIRE BOOK FOR HIM TO SEE ANY MORE COMBAT HE'D ALREADY SHOWN US HOW GOOD HE WAS HIS DANGER WAS ESTABLISHED

THIS NEW THRAWN HASN'T DONE ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THAT ALL WE HAVE IS EVERYONE'S WORD FOR IT THAT HE'S THIS BRILLIANT GENIUS THIS AND THE FACT THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE HAS DELIBERATELY LET OUR HEROES APPROACH HIM ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS AND WALK AWAY UNHARMED HAS ESTABLISHED THAT HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF A THREAT AT LEAST FOR RIGHT NOW

AND LETS FACE IT HE'LL PROBABLY BE KILLED OFF THE SAME EPISODE HE FINALLY SPRINGS THAT BIG PLAN HE'S WORKING ON RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT WE SWEAR THIS PLAN WILL BE SO COMPLEX AND INESCAPABLE AND GLORIOUS THAT THRAWN BEING ASSASSINATED BY KALLUS IS THE ONLY WAY FOR OUR HEROES TO MAKE IT TO SEASON IT'LL BE VERY DRAMATIC AND ARTISTICALLY DONE
THRAWN HAS ALREADY SEEN FACE YOU WOULD THINK HE WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM
SOUNDS REALLY PROMISING ALSO COOL CALLBACK TO THE SEASON EPISODE FIGHTER FLIGHT IT'S THE SAME FARMER DUDE THAT EZRA HELPED WAY BACK WHEN ESCAPE FROM THE EMPIRE LOOKS LIKE HE DID NOT MAKE IT FAR ON HIS OWN
HE BETTER DIE I KNOW REBELS IS A KID SHOW BUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH DEATH IN KID'S SHOWS I KNOW STORM-TROOPER GET KILLED IN IT BUT WE NEED TO SEE SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS A FACE BITE IT THRAWN HAS PRETTY MUCH DONE NOTHING SO FAR STAR WARS EXPLAINED EVEN RECOGNIZED THAT
THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS GOING ON IN THIS THREAD
HE'S DONE THIS STUFF BEFORE

SPECIFIC EXAMPLE WHEN LUKE SKYWALKER ESCAPED HIS GRASP IN THE EU THRAWN CALMLY WALKED DOWN TO THE GUY WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HIM AND ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION HE THEN WENT TO THIS SUPERIOR ASKED WHAT WAS UP AND THEN MADE AN EXAMPLE OF THE GUY WHO MESSED UP

CORRECTED THE ERROR BEFORE IT BECAME A MISTAKE AS IT WERE

SO HERE'S THE THING ABOUT WHY I'M UPSET WITH THIS THRAWN HE HAS NOT PROVED HIMSELF YET HONESTLY THIS SHOULD NOT BE WHERE WE MEET HIM

WE SHOULD HAVE MET HIM IN THE NEW MOVIES SO ON SO FORTH

WHAT MADE THRAWN SPECIAL WAS THAT HE TURNED THE DEFEAT OF THE EMPIRE AROUND DURING THE EU THE EMPIRE WAS CONTINUALLY GETTING ROUTED BY THE NEW REPUBLIC KEPT LOSING UNTIL THEY WERE CONSIDERED A JOKE BUT THRAWN CAME BACK UNITED CERTAIN CELLS OF IMPERIALS AND THEN MOVED TOWARDS RESTORING ORDER HE SHOWED HOW HE COULD BEST AN OVERWHELMING FORCE PLAN ENGAGEMENTS FAR AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND SHOWED HOW HE WANTED TO INTRODUCE A NEW EMPIRE THAT WAS BETTER THAN THE OLD ONE THRAWN WAS LIKABLE AND HAD AN AMAZING WITH HIM IN THE FORM OF CAPTAIN PELLATION WHO WAS KIND OF THE WATSON TO HOLMES

HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER USED IN THE NEW MOVIES AS THIS MILITARY GENIUS WHO TOOK THE FIRST ORDER AND MADE THEM A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH MADE THEM MORE THAN FANATICS HE'D HAVE A UNIQUE LOOK AMONG THE BLACK CLAD OFFICERS AS WELL WITH HIS WHITE UNIFORM

BUT HERE YOU DON'T SEE A GRAND STRATEGY OR SOMEONE TRYING TO ESTABLISH SOMETHING GREATER HE'S PERFECTLY CONTENT WITH THINGS
NO ONE GONNA MENTION HOW THE STORM-TROOPER WHO SAYS BACK IN LINE SOUNDS LIKE A CLONE CAUSE IMO IT'D BE COOL TO SEE SOME CLONE STORM-TROOPER
A BLIND GUY AND THE DUDE WHO INFILTRATED MY HQ ON RYLOTH THEY'RE DEFINITELY SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
WHAT BOTHER ME IS THIS RUTHLESSNESS IS ALREADY WHAT WE ARE USED TO BY OTHER IMPERIAL OFFICERS PUBLIC EXAMPLES ETC

I WOULD REALLY PREFER TO SEE THRAWN BEING REALLY SPECIAL I DON'T KNOW HIM PRIOR THE SHOW I'M STILL DISCOVERING THE EU BUT AT THIS POINT I JUST FEEL HE MAKES SOME REFERENCE TO ITS REPUTATION QUOTE ON ART QUOTE ON HOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE SMART BUT ON THE TERRAIN IT COMES TO SOMETHING REALLY GENERIC
THE FACT THAT HE LET REBELS ESCAPED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON WAS SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BEST IF THERE IS A PAY-OFF TO THAT SETUP

AGENT KALLUS IN ITS RUN WOULD HAVE DONE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING AS THRAWN IN THIS PREVIEW AND TO ITS JUSTICE KALLUS IS NOW A WAY MORE INTERESTING CHARACTER THAN MANY OTHERS AND AT THIS POINT I'M MORE INTERESTED IN HIS DEVELOPMENT THAN IN ONE

I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW THRAWN LETS THE REBELS ESCAPE
I HEARD THRAWN CAPTURES THE GHOST CREW AFTER A LENGTHY GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE THEN BEATS REX AND HEADS IN WITH A BARBED WIRE COVERED DAFFI STICK IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS TO ENSURE THEIR OBEDIENCE TRUE
GRAND ADMIRAL JIGSAW
WHY IS THRAWN PICKING ON THE LITTLE DUDE HE WAS NEVER THAT GUY THE EMPIRE IS FULL OF THOSE GUYS PEOPLE WHO THROW THEIR WEIGHT AROUND TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL POWERFUL BUT THRAWN WAS NEVER ONE OF THOSE IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT MADE HIM DIFFERENT

THIS HAS TO BE A DELIBERATE TRAP FOR EZRA OR SOMETHING WELL NOT A TRAP IN THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO PROVOKE A REACTION NOT HINDER HIM IN ANY WAY EZRA WILL WALK AWAY WITH HIS TINY VICTORY AND THRAWN WILL SAY SOME VERSION OF YEEEESSSSSS ALL ACCORDING TO PLAN BECAUSE WE AREN'T AT THE MID-SEASON FINALE YET AND WE HAVE THAT MANY MORE EPISODES OF DICKING AROUND TO GET THROUGH BEFORE OUR LEGENDARY CHASS DEMONSTRATES EXACTLY WHAT HE CAN DO THAT LARKIN OR KRENNIC OR ONE OF THE OTHER MASTERMIND IMPERIALS CAN'T

AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR EVENTUALLY MAYBE I CONFESS TO NOT A LOT OF HOPE

THE FACT THAT THE DUDE HAS A PELLATION STACE IS JUST SALT IN THE WOUND


IN A GALAXY JAR JAR AWAY

JAR JAR

THEY KNEW
FOUND OUT TODAY THAT ARGUABLY THE MOST ICONIC POSTERS FOR THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY WERE BASED OFF THE CONCEPT ILLUSTRATIONS OF TOM JUNG

AS SEEN WITH BOTH OF THESE POSTERS FOR STAR WARS

THE ONE ON THE LEFT DONE BY TOM JUNG AND THE ONE THE RIGHT DONE LATER ON BY THE HILDEBRANDT BROTHERS LUCAS COMMISSIONED THE BROTHERS TO MAKE A PROMOTIONAL PIECE DRAWING A LOT OF INSPIRATION FROM TOM PIECE
LOOKS LIKE LUKE IS EMBRACING BEN THERE

NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE THOUGH THIS IS AMAZING
ROGUE ONE IS LITERALLY GOING TO END WHERE ANH BEGINS LARKIN WOULD BE THE EXACT SAME AGE THAT BEING SAID WHILE I'D LOVE DANCE I'M AN IMPERIAL ROLE MAYBE A MEMBER OF THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL OR SOMETHING I DON'T THINK HE'D BE A GOOD FIT FOR LARKIN
HE SHOULD PLAY UNCLE JONAH IF THEY EVER NEEDED THAT CHARACTER IN A TV SHOW OR SOMETHING I CAN SEE HIM BEING OF RELATION TO LARKIN BUT NOT THE MAN HIMSELF
HE WOULD BE A GREAT STAR WARS VILLAIN BUT NOT LARKIN
DANCE WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT CHOICE BUT HIS AGE SETS HIM OUT I THINK IN ROGUE ONE I THINK THEY WANTED SOMEONE A LITTLE YOUNGER DANCE IS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS CUSHING WAS IN ANH WOULD HAVE KILLED IT THOUGH
MAYBE NOT LARKIN BUT HE WOULD BE A PHENOMENAL VILLAIN IN ANY OTHER MOVIE HE IS AN AWESOME ACTOR AND THIS WOULD BE A GREAT MOVE MAYBE EPISODE KANJIKLUB LEADER OR SOMETHING
NUMBER AND THE REASON WHY FOR ME IS THAT ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT STAR WARS IS THE FACT THAT THEY USE UNKNOWN ACTORS AND ACTRESSES WHEN YOU PUT FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE MOVIES IT DETRACTS FROM THE EXPERIENCE THE HAN SOLO MOVIE IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO ENJOY WITH ALL THE CELEBRITY POWER COMING DON'T GET ME WRONG I LOVE DONALD GLOVER AND THINK HE WILL PLAY A FANTASTIC LANDO AND I ENJOY EMILIA CLARKE BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE SITTING THERE WATCHING THE MOVIE AND THINKING ABOUT COMMUNITY AND GAME OF THRONES THE FORCE AWAKENS HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS AS DID THE PREQUEL TRILOGY DAISY RIDLEY AND JOHN BODEGA ARE GREAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THEM BUT WHEN IT CAME TO SNAP BEXLEY GREG GRUNBERG I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING BUT HEROES WHEN I SAW HIM ON SCREEN
VADER SNEEZING WOULD SOUND SCARY
AT LEAST IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE EAST TENSE WITH A BRA


R STARWARD COMMENTS
VERY UNDERTAKE
LOOKS LIKE SANS FROM UNDERTAKE
OR THE GUY FROM UNDERTAKE
FRIEND LOOKS LIKE A TWIN BROTHER I MAY JUST BE TIRED BUT YOU GUYS LOOK SO ALIKE

ALSO GREAT COSTUMES
DID YOU HAVE A HIGHER GROUND
THAT'S GREAT WHERE DID YOU GET THE COSTUME
SHOULD HAVE GONE AS AND OR CLONE TROOPERS
I ALSO WANNA KNOW WHERE YOU GOT THE COSTUME IS IT THE ONE OFF OF AMAZON
IS THAT THE ARENA THERE BY THE TYNE IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN THERE BUT I GREW UP IN TEESSIDE
NEAT COSTUMES

DID YOU MAKE THEM YOURSELVES

IF NOT WHERE DID YOU GET THEM
ANAKIN GREW A BEARD
WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR BELTS I GOT AN ANAKIN COSTUME BUT THE BELT AND FABRIC BEHIND IT IS TOO SMALL
WAS IT A DIY IF NOT WHAT TUNIC SET DID YOU BUY I'M LOOKING FOR AN NOW ACTUALLY
TELL YOU WHAT THEY CAN DO

THEY CAN TAKE THE JEDI PROTAGONIST FROM THE PREVIOUS MOVIE AND HAVE THEM TRAIN AND LEARN ABOUT THE FORCE WITH A WISE OLD JEDI MASTER THIS JEDI MASTER IS IN EXILE ON A REMOTE PLANET BY HIMSELF BECAUSE A PUPIL OF HIS TURNED TO THE DARK SIDE AND DESTROYED THE JEDI ORDER BY DOING THIS HIS PUPIL BECAME THE DARK LORD VILLAIN OF THE CURRENT TRILOGY AND ITS UP TO THE WISE OLD JEDI HERMIT TO BUILD UP THE PROTAGONIST TO BE SOMEONE WHO CAN STOP HIM POSSIBLY TO HELP TURN HIM BACK TO THE LIGHT SIDE AND OVERTHROW THE LEADER OF THE ARMY THEY ARE FIGHTING AGAINST

MEANWHILE THE DARK LORD VILLAIN FROM THE PREVIOUS MOVIE IS TASKED BY HIS LEADER TO GO AFTER THIS PROTAGONIST AND POSSIBLY ATTEMPT TO TURN THEM TO THE DARK SIDE AND THE EVIL ARMY WANTS TO LAUNCH A REVENGE ATTACK ON THE RAG TAG BAND OF DISSENTERS WHO DESTROYED THEIR DESTRUCTIVE SPACE STATION FROM THE PREVIOUS MOVIE
WELL THE NEW REPUBLIC IS DEFINITELY NOT IN GOOD SHAPE AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF BOSNIAN PRIME

ALSO FILMING HAS COMPLETED SO IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR PLEAS

ARIAN JOHNSON IS AN EXCEPTIONAL PRESENCE IN THE FILM INDUSTRY I'D WAGER THIS FILM IS IN GOOD HANDS
I'VE EXPRESSED MANY TIMES THAT I'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AS HELL IF THE NEW REPUBLIC IS VIRTUALLY GONE AND WE'RE JUST STUCK WITH THE RESISTANCE I WANT HUGE BATTLES LIKE THE BATTLE OF CORUSCANT THROUGHOUT THE NEW FILMS BETWEEN THE FIRST ORDER AND THE NR I ALSO HAVE A SMALL SHRED OF HOPE THAT THE NEW JEDI AREN'T REALLY DEAD BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY REALLY ARE THE TRILOGY WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABOUT RESTORING THEM SEEMS LIKE IT WILL BE BASED ON THE DIALOGUE IN FFA
LUKE SAYS REY I AM NOT YOUR FATHER
SOMEONE ASKED PABLO HIDALGO ABOUT SHIPS FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS AND HE HINTED WE WOULD SEE THEM IN A MOVIE HE HAS SINCE DELETED THIS TWEET HERE'S THE REDDIN DISCUSSION

ARIAN JOHNSON HAD THE POLITICAL MAKE UP OF THE NEW REPUBLIC ADDED TO BLOODLINE WHICH STRONGLY IMPLIES THAT THOSE POLITICAL PARTIES WILL PLAY A PART IN VIII

LEIA WAS DRESSED MORE LIKE A SENATOR THAN A GENERAL AT THE END OF FFA

ALL OF THIS WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE NEW REPUBLIC STILL HAS A PART TO PLAY IN THIS STORY

ALSO I THINK SCENES WITH LUKE ARE GOING TO BE LESS FOCUSED ON HER TRAINING AND MORE FOCUSED ON HER HELPING LUKE WITH WHATEVER HE WENT LOOKING FOR AT THE FIRST TEMPLE
FFA DID INCLUDE A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS FROM ESB SNOW PLANET FATHER CONFRONTATION AND FALL INTO ABYSS CAVE VISION ETC SO SIMPLY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF STORY BEATS HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE ROOM FOR NEW THINGS IN VIII ALTHOUGH I DO EXPECT SOME LUKE YODA PARALLELS AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE SOME HOMAGE TO CLOUD CITY

AS FAR AS THE STATE OF THE GALAXY YEAH I DO HOPE THAT THE ACTUAL NEW REPUBLIC FIGURES IN AND THAT THE GOOD GUYS ARE NOT THE SMALLER FACTION YET AGAIN
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF BOSNIAN A LARGE SCALE SPACE BATTLE WOULD BE AWESOME AS WELL
I'LL JUST BE HAPPY AS LONG AS THE MAX REBO BAND DOESN'T SHOW UP
THE NEW REPUBLIC WON'T BE DEAD IF MOST ALL THE U SOUTH NAVAL FLEET AND AIR FORCE WAS STATIONED AT WASHINGTON D COUNTY AND IT WAS ALL WIPED OUT IN A SINGLE STRIKE IT'D BE A MASSIVE BLOW SURE BUT IT WOULDN'T IMMEDIATELY DESTROY THE WHOLE COUNTRY
NO THEY CAN ALSO MAKE IT BE A PERSONAL CONFLICT OR LARGELY PERSONAL CONFLICT FRAMED BY WAR INSTEAD OF A WAR
I MEAN IF THE FAN THEORIES ABOUT CERTAIN CHARACTERS ARE ACTUALLY TRUE THERE IS NO WAY THEY WON'T REHASH THE REST OF THE OT

THAT BEING SAID I THINK THEY KNOW SOME WERE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE STARKVILLE BASE SO IF THEY DECIDED TO PULL A JEDI AND GIVE US THE FIFTH MOVIE IN THE STORY TO FOCUS ON A SUPER WEAPON LIKE THAT A LOT OF FANS WOULD GIVE UP TOO
WHAT WORKS FOR WORDBUILDING MAY NOT WORK FOR A FILM

A SECOND SUPERPOWER PUT OUR HEROES IN A POSITION OF POWER AND A GIANT SAFE ZONE FROM THE VILLAINS


THUS CREATING REDUCED TENSION
I HOPE FOR SOME BIG BIG DOGS FIGHTS IN SPACE WE NEED THAT BIG CLASH IN SPACE LIKE IN THE INTRO TO REVENGE OF THE SITH THAT SCENE STILL HOLDS UP

I REALLY HOPE THAT NOT ALL OF JEDI DIED BUT SOME FLEET WE NEED A BIG FORCE OF JEDI AND SITH WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT YET
REY I KILLED YOUR FATHER LUKE
YOU CAN SEE IT ONLY FOR A SPLIT SECOND JUST AFTER THE 2ND THUNDER
YA IT IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME
GUESS IT'S EITHER THE TEMPLE A SHIP OR THE TREE
MAYBE WE'LL FIND OUT IN A YEAR
MY MONEY IS ON AN EPISODE TRAILER PLAYING DURING THE SUPERBOWL NO REAL REASON JUST A HUNCH
NO EP STUFF BEFORE ROGUE ONE IN MY OPINION IT WOULD STEAL ITS THUNDER FEB OR MARCH WHEN ROGUE ONE HAS HAD IT'S RUN THEN WE CAN FOCUS ON EP FULL STEAM AHEAD
IT WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO DO THAT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'LL HAPPEN
IT WON'T HAPPEN DISNEY WON'T TAKE AWAY FROM ROGUE ONE'S MARKETING WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT EPISODE WILL DO MARKETING WAS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT WAS THE RETURN OF STAR WARS SO THEY COULD START TEASING IT A YEAR IN ADVANCE THEY CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE BECAUSE IT WILL NOW OVERLAY WITH WHATEVER THE CURRENT MOVIE OUT IN THEATERS IS THEY WILL START TEASING EPISODE ONCE ROGUE ONE IS OUT ON DVD JUST LIKE THE ROGUE ONE'S MARKETING STARTED A FEW DAYS AFTER FFA CAME OUT ON DVD THEY WILL MOST LIKELY SHOW THE FIRST TEASER OR AT LEAST TITLE DURING CELEBRATION IN
THAT FIRST TEASER TRAILER IS PERFECTION IT MADE ME RELAX AS A FAN AND GO AHOUH STAR WARS IS IN GOOD HANDS THANK GOD
I'M GUESSING APRIL WILL BE THE FIRST TRAILER AND TITLE REVEAL THE FORCE AWAKENS WAS THE BIG RETURN OF THE FRANCHISE SO ITS NO SURPRISE THEY STARTED THE TEASERS EARLY
THIS ORIGINAL TRAILER IS A SPECIAL BEAST HOW MANY TRAILERS GET AN ORIGINAL COMPOSITION BY JOHN WILLIAMS
I THINK THEY'LL WAIT UNTIL AFTER ROGUE ONE TO START DROPPING TEASERS FOR EPISODE HOPEFULLY WHILE IT'S STILL IN THEATERS THOUGH BECAUSE I'M DYING TO SEE ANYTHING FROM EPISODE
THIS TRAILER DROPPED ABOUT A WEEK AFTER MY WEDDING

I HAD BEEN A HUGE STAR WARS FAN AS A CHILD AND AS TEENAGER BUT HITTING MY IT HAD DWINDLED AND SIMMERED DOWN MY WIFE WAS AWARE THAT I WAS A FAN SHE HADN'T SEEN SW BEFORE AND WE ALWAYS HAD PLANNED A MARATHON BUT NEVER GOT AROUND TO IT

SO LIFE WAS FINE AND DANDY I PROPOSED TO HER IN AND GOT MARRIED A YEAR LATER SO AFTER THE WEDDING THIS TRAILER DROPS AND IT'S LIKE I CAME OUT OF THE DARK AGES FOR SW
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A THING HAPPEN BUT IT'D BE AMAZING IF AN EPISODE TRAILER AIRED ALONGSIDE ROGUE ONE IN THEATRES THAT'D MAKE THE WHOLE MOVIE HYPE FROM PREVIEWS TO CREDITS
BECAUSE TO ME THE MOST INEXCUSABLE FAULT WITH THE STAR WARS PREQUEL WAS EQUATING THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE WITH THE WEAKNESS OF FALLING IN LOVE JUST STEW ON THAT FOR A MOMENT ANAKIN BECOMES THE PREEMINENT BADASS OF THE GALAXY BECAUSE HE COMMITS THE SIN OF FALLING IN LOVE THAT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY STOOD FOR

HERE'S A BIG FLAW IN YOUR REASONING ANAKIN DIDN'T FALL TO THE DARK SIDE BECAUSE HE FELL IN LOVE HE FELL TO THE DARK SIDE BECAUSE HE WAS SELFISH

HE COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT FADME HE COULDN'T LET HER GO HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT LOVING SOMEONE SOMETIMES MEANS LETTING THEM GO YOU COULD ARGUE THAT ANAKIN WAS TRYING TO SAVE LIFE AND THAT WOULD BE A NOBLE DEED BUT THE IRONY IS THAT SHE WOULDN'T HAVE DIED IF HER NEVER TOOK SIDE

IN RETURN OF THE JEDI ANAKIN REDEEMS HIMSELF AND HIS ACTIONS WERE MOTIVATED BY HIS LOVE FOR HIS SON BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS WAS A SELF LESS LOVE HE KNEW HIS ACTIONS WOULD RESULT IN HIS DEATH BUT HE DOESN'T CARE BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT HIS SON WHO ANAKIN HAS COME TO LOVE WOULD LIVE ON HIS LOVE FOR LUKE ISN'T POSSESSIVE LIKE HIS LOVE FOR FADME THERE WAS AN ASPECT OF MUTUAL RESPECT THAT SEEMED TO BE MISSING FROM RELATIONSHIP WITH FADME

THE OLD JEDI DIDN'T DISAPPROVE OF LOVE AND ROMANCE THEY DISAPPROVED OF THE ATTACHMENT TO THAT PERSON THEY UNDERSTAND THAT LIFE IS A PRECIOUS GIFT THAT DOESN'T LAST FOREVER THEY HAVE ACCEPTED THAT ALL THINGS EVENTUALLY MOVE ON AND THAT SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME GRIEVING FOR SOMEONE OR SOMETHING THEY HAVE LOST ROBS THEM OF THEIR OWN PRECIOUS TIME IN THE WORLD THEY FEEL IT IS FOOLISH BECAUSE ALL THINGS BECOME PART OF THE FORCE WHEN THEY MOVE ON AND THEREFORE THEY WILL ALWAYS BE A PART OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN SOME WAY THEY AREN'T TRULY GONE
BECAUSE TO ME THE MOST INEXCUSABLE FAULT WITH THE STAR WARS PREQUEL WAS EQUATING THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE WITH THE WEAKNESS OF FALLING IN LOVE JUST STEW ON THAT FOR A MOMENT ANAKIN BECOMES THE PREEMINENT BADASS OF THE GALAXY BECAUSE HE COMMITS THE SIN OF FALLING IN LOVE THAT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY STOOD FOR ONLY THROUGH THEIR LOVE AND THE SACRIFICES THAT COME WITH IT DO OUR HEROES SUCCEED

THIS IS JUST COMPLETELY WRONG ANAKIN FALLS TO THE DARK SIDE BECAUSE OF HIS DESIRE TO STOP THOSE HE LOVES FROM DYING NOT JUST FROM FALLING IN LOVE ITSELF THIS IS MIRRORED IN EMPIRE WHEN LUKE IS URGED NOT TO GO TO CLOUD CITY TO SAVE HIS FRIENDS AND MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE
REALLY THIS IS THE ONLY STAR WARS MOVIE THAT CONTAINS ABSOLUTELY ZERO ROMANTIC ENTANGLEMENTS OF ANY KIND

DISAGREE IF THERE IS A ROMANTIC ENTANGLEMENT IN THE PHANTOM MENACE OR A NEW HOPE BESIDES THE TWO SECONDS OF SCREENTIME THAT UNCLE OWEN AND AUNT BARU SHARED I AM MISSING IT

THERE WERE NO ESTABLISHED ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS IN THESE FILMS ROMANTIC ENTANGLEMENTS DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL HALFWAY THROUGH THE SECOND INSTALLMENTS OF EACH RESPECTIVE TRILOGY

YOU MIGHT ARGUE THAT THE SUBTEXT FOR ANAKIN AND FADME WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE PHANTOM MENACE OR THAT THERE WERE ALLUSIONS TO HAN AND LEIA IN EPISODE IV BUT SAID ENTANGLEMENTS WERE NOT OBVIOUS TO NEWCOMERS UPON FIRST VIEWINGS OF THESE FILMS BEFORE EACH TRILOGY HAD BEEN COMPLETED IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK TO THE FORCE AWAKENS AND SEE THE SPARKS OF WHATEVER RELATIONSHIP S THEY FOLLOW THROUGH WITH UPON VIEWING EPISODES VIII AND IX I FIND IT HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE NO ROMANCE AT ALL GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF LOVE AND HUMAN BONDS TO THE SAGA OVERALL

EDIT JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED ROMANCE IN FFA JUST LIKE THERE WAS NOT IN TPM OR ANH SEEDS OF WHATEVER ROMANCE S THE WRITERS WILL PURSUE HAVE BEEN PLANTED IN FFA AND LIKE THE TWO TRILOGIES BEFORE FFA SAID SEEDS WILL BECOME OBVIOUS AS THE SEQUEL TRILOGY UNFOLDS
I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON THE REST OF YOUR POST BUT

ROMANTIC LOVE HAS NO REPRESENTATION IN THIS FILM AND I KNOW EVERYONE WANTS IT

SPEAK FOR YOURSELF PLEASE
THE VERSIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE GEORGE LUCAS CUT BEST EDIT THERE IS HONORABLE MENTION TO THAT ONE EDIT OF ROTS THAT TAKES THE DELETED SCENES ABOUT THE FORMATION OF THE REBELLION AND EDITS THEM BACK IN BUT IS OTHERWISE UNTOUCHED
THEY'RE FINE THE WAY THEY ARE IN MY OPINION
I FOR SOME REASON HAVE NOT FOUND AN EDIT I'M INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW FANS WOULD WANT TO FIX THE PREQUEL
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AT
THE OBLIVION EDIT IN WHICH EACH RUNTIME IS EDITED DOWN TO IT'S A BLAST
BLACKENED MANTLE

IT HAS ITS ISSUES IT DOESN'T REDEEM THE PREQUEL IN MY EYES IT ISN'T A STAR WARS Y EDIT AND DOESN'T EVEN PRETEND TO FIT THE STYLE OF THE FRANCHISE AND IT'S STILL UNMEMORABLE AND BORING BUT IT'S VERY WATCHABLE AND SURPRISINGLY IT MADE ALL CHARACTERS RELATABLE WELL MADE AND WELL WRITTEN EVEN THE ACTING WAS HEAVILY IMPROVED THANKS TO THE JAPANESE DUB USED
WE DO HAVE UPCOMING MOVIES IN THE SIDEBAR IT'S RIGHT THERE DAYS
GOOD LUCK
LETS HOPE FOR THE BEST THIS ONE

THIS ONES THE LAST HOPE
THERE'S BEEN A BUNCH OF THESE AND USUALLY THEY LAST FOR A COUPLE MONTHS THERE'S SOME DRAMA WITH THE ADMINS AND IT GOES AWAY
SIGH IS BTL WORTH SUFFERING THROUGH THE NE AGAIN

EDIT DOWN VOTERS I'M GENUINELY CURIOUS TO HEAR WHY YOU DISAGREE WITH MY OPINION ON THE NE
THE VIDEO DIDN'T WORK FOR ME
I'M A GRAPHIC DESIGNER AND WAS WORKING ON A PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR A LOCAL MOVIE THEATRE I CAME UP WITH THIS DESIGN BUT IT ENDED UP NEEDING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DUE TO STRICT LIKABILITY POLICY SO I DECIDED TO MAKE IT INTO A CONCEPT POSTER

FEEDBACK COMMENTS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED
IS THAT A MOON
YOU SHOULD MAKE THE TOP WORDS A BIT BRIGHTER BUT NOT TO BRIGHT OTHER THAN THAT IT LOOKS GOOD
I LIKE IT VERY GOOD
TO HELP ME TO APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS STAR WARS AND NOT SOME VERY SKILLED FANS APPROXIMATION OF IT

ISN'T BASICALLY THE ENTIRE LUCASFILM STORY GROUP COMPRISED OF PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE BEFORE GEORGE SOLD TO DISNEY IT'S NOT LIKE GEORGE WROTE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN STAR WARS PRIOR THEY WOULD JUST WRITE IT AND GEORGE WOULD SAY YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA

AND KAJDAN WAS OF THE WRITERS FOR THE FFA SCREENPLAY THE SAME GUY WHO WROTE EMPIRE AND JEDI
AS YOU CAN SEE BY MANY REPLIES MANY OF US FEEL THAT WAY

FORGIVE ME FOR GENERALIZING BUT I THINK THAT A VENN DIAGRAM OF STAR WARS FANS WOULD HAVE TWO CIRCLES THAT OVERLAP VERY LITTLE ONE CIRCLE REPRESENTING PREQUEL FANS AND ONE CIRCLE REPRESENTING FFA FANS

I FEEL LIKE YOU AND AM ALSO A PREQUEL FAN I THINK THAT EVEN IF I DIDN'T KNOW THAT LUCAS WAS NOT INVOLVED IN FFA I WOULD FEEL IT THE MOVIE IS FAR DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE SAGA AND IN MANY STRUCTURAL WAYS

I DO BELIEVE KATHLEEN KENNEDY AND PABLO HIDALGO WHO SAY THAT FFA EVOLVED LIKE ANY MOVIE WOULD FROM THE ORIGINAL OUTLINE PROVIDED BY LUCAS BUT OBVIOUSLY ONLY THE BARE BONES WERE USED BECAUSE THE STRUCTURE UNDERLYING THE PLOT FEELS FOREIGN TO STAR WARS IN MY OPINION OF COURSE

FACT IS FFA RELIES ON ABRAMS LOVE OF THE MYSTERY BOX BUT NONE OF THE OTHER SAGA MOVIES DID ALTHOUGH PROBABLY THE BIGGEST REVEAL IN MOVIE HISTORY IS IN ESB BUT THE AUDIENCE DID NOT KNOW IT WAS COMING THE OT AND PT DIDN'T PLAY A GAME OF TELEGRAPHING AUDIENCES THAT THERE ARE SECRETS TO BE REVEALED LATER THAT'S WHAT LOST DID AND WHAT STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS DID AND MANY OF ABRAMS PRODUCTIONS DID

ALSO ALL OF FILMS HAD A CLEAR BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END FFA HAS A MARVELOUS BEGINNING I FREAKING LOVE A LOT OF THE FIRST ACT I WONDER IF THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MOST OF BONES ARE SHOWING BUT THE MOMENT REY AND FINN LIFT OFF OF ZAKKEU THE MOVIE DEVOLVES INTO A MESS AND IN MY HUMBLE OPINION THE MESS IS A DIRECT PRODUCT OF ATTEMPTING TO HINT AND HIDE SECRETS FROM THE AUDIENCE THE FIRST ACT FEELS LIKE STAR WARS TO ME IT'S EARNEST AND SIMPLE AND MOVES ALONG THE PATH WITH CONFIDENCE THEN A MESSY SECOND ACT WHICH IS CAPPED BY A VERY FAMILIAR THIRD ACT AND THEN AN ALMOST LITERAL CLIFFHANGER YES THE MACGUFFIN WAS RESOLVED BUT IT HAD ALMOST NO RELATION TO THE PLOT EXCEPT THE VERY BEGINNING

ANYWAY I'M SURE MANY FOLKS DISAGREE WITH MY ANALYSIS AND PROBABLY NO ONE WANTS TO READ MANY PARAGRAPHS DETAILING ONE FAN'S PSYCHOANALYSIS SO I'LL STOP HERE
PERSONALLY I HAVE THEM DIVIDED INTO ERAS THE OT ORIGINAL EU I KEEP IN ONE POCKET WITH THE PREQUEL BEING THEIR THING AND THE SEQUELS BEING ANOTHER THEY TIE TOGETHER LOOSELY IT HELPS ME LOOK AT THEM ON THEIR OWN I WISH IT WAS MORE TIGHT AND CONSISTENT BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS IT'S A BIT EASIER FOR ME TO LUMP THE PREQUEL WITH THE OT SINCE I WAS BORN INTO THE PREQUEL ESSENTIALLY BUT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF STYLE AND FEEL I THINK THAT'S WHAT TOOK ME OUT OF FFA THE MOST IT WASN'T THAT IT WAS BAD IT WAS THAT IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE ANYTHING PREVIOUS IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE ASIDE FROM THE STORY ITSELF BUT I MEAN IN TERMS OF THE EFFECTS AND THE WAY IT WAS FILMED AFTER A WHILE MAYBE WE'LL LOOK BACK ON FFA AND HAVE A NEW FONDNESS FOR IT AND IT'LL BE EASIER TO LOOK AT IN THE COMPLETED PICTURE TIME WILL TELL COULD ALSO BE THAT STAR WARS HAS TAKEN OVER EVERYTHING NOW YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT SEEING IT PERHAPS ONCE IT BECOMES MORE CONSISTENT AND THE HYPE OF IT BEING BACK DIES DOWN IT'LL BE EASIER TO ENJOY
I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY ABOUT THE NU TREK MOVIES
COULDN'T AGREE MORE
I ALSO FELT DETACHED FROM THE NEW MOVIE IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS A CONTINUATION OF THE STAR WARS STORY EVEN THOUGH IT HAD MANY OF THE SAME CHARACTERS IT WAS SORT OF SAD TO SEE EVERYONE OLDER TOO I DIDN'T REALLY DIG IT I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN ESPECIALLY AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF READING THE NOVELS AND ESTABLISHING THE EVENTS THAT FOLLOWED ROTC

THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO AGREE WITH YOU BUT YOU WON'T FIND MANY ON THIS FORUM

I THINK IT'S A GENERATIONAL THING TO BE HONEST MANY OF THE OLDER FANS GREW UP ON ALL OF THE EU NOVELS WHERE AS MANY OF THE YOUNGER STAR WARS FANS DIDN'T I THINK THAT PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN HOW YOU LINK FFA TO THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY
IN MY OPINION FFA DIDN'T FEEL LIKE EPISODE VII IT FELT LIKE A TRIBUTE REMAKE REBOOT

IF NOTHING ELSE THE PREQUEL STILL FELT LIKE THEY ALL FIT INTO THE SAME STORY AND DID A GOOD JOB OF PORTRAYING A DIFFERENT ERA BEFORE THE EMPIRE

HOWEVER I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT ROGUE ONE IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL NOT ONLY CONNECT PERFECTLY TO ANH IT ALSO APPEARS TO BE WAY MORE CREATIVE THAN FFA
THEY FEEL LIKE VISITORS TO THE UNIVERSE RATHER THAN TRUE INHABITANTS

FOR ME THIS WAS THE PART THAT THEY REALLY NAILED I FEEL LIKE THE NUMBER ONE DIRECTIVE OF THIS MOVIE CREATIVELY SPEAKING WAS TO ESTABLISH THE NEW CHARACTERS I FEEL LIKE PLOT TO AN EXTENT WAS SACRIFICED FOR THAT GOAL

I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE REALLY SUCCESSFUL AT ESTABLISHING THESE NEW CHARACTERS THEY WERE A GOOD MIX OF OUR OLD HEROES BUT BROUGHT A LOT TO THE TABLE MY FAVORITE NEW CHARACTER IS KALO REN VISUALLY HIS LOOK IS VERY STRIKING HIS VOICE WITH THE MASK IS PERFECT BETTER THAN VADER FOR ME I REALLY LIKE THAT HE'S KIND OF A SCREW-UP HE KEEPS SCREWING THINGS UP THROUGH THIS MOVIE AND WE SEE HIM HAVE THOSE MOMENTS OF PURE FRUSTRATION WITH HIMSELF HE'S VERY POWERFUL WITH THE FORCE DESPITE WHAT A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THINK HE'S PRETTY DAMN BADASS I JUST THINK HE'S A GREAT SUCCESSOR TO VADER WHEREAS VADER WAS A REPRESENTATION OF THE FEARS OF THE COLD WAR ERA THE BIG FACELESS MONOLITHIC MAN COMING TO DESTROY YOU WITH HIS EMPIRE I THINK KALO MORE REPRESENTS THE FEATS OF TODAY THE MISGUIDED DUDE WHO DOESN'T LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS AND GOES AND DOES SOMETHING TERRIBLE IN PUBLIC
PRETTY MUCH TO ME THE NEW SW TRILOGY IS JUST THE HUNGER GAMES IN SPACE

CLEAN AND GOOD LOOKING YOUNG ADULTS WHO CAN SOLVE EVERYTHING WITHOUT MUCH GUIDANCE FROM THEIR ELDERS WAS HAN REALLY EVEN NEEDED IN THAT FILM

THAT SAID I FEEL THAT ROGUE ONE LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE STAR WARS AT LEAST FROM THE TRAILERS

FOR ONE WE SEEM TO HAVE ESTABLISHING SHOTS TO SHOW OFF THE LANDSCAPE THIS IS THE KUROSAWA AND SERGIO LEONE INFLUENCE THAT PERMEATED SW AND WAS MISSING FROM FFA LIKEWISE THIS GIVES BREATHING ROOM FOR THE MUSIC TO SHINE THROUGH ALA THE TWIN SUNSET SCENE OR END OF ESB ALSO MISSING IN FFA LONG ESTABLISHING SHOTS ARE WHAT INVITES US INTO THE SW UNIVERSE

TWO WE GOT CHARACTERS OF VARIOUS AGES AND BACKGROUNDS SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN GETTING THOSE PLANS IT'S NOT JUST ONE CHARACTER WHO CAN DO EVERYTHING A DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE WILL COME TOGETHER AND POOL IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE EXPERTISE AND WORK OFF ONE ANOTHER

THIRD WE GET THAT GRITTY LOOK BACK SW ISN'T STAR TREK IT NEEDS A FUTURISTIC RUNDOWN LOOK I GUESS FFA WAS OKAY WITH THIS BUT MAYBE THINGS WENT TOO SMOOTH TO NOTICE IT IT WASN'T LIKE HAN TRYING TO FIX HIS SHIP OR LUKE NEEDING TO FIX THE DROIDS

FOR EXAMPLE REY SHOULD BE SCAVENGING FOR JUNK AND THEN COMES ACROSS FINN IN THIS WAY WE KNOW HER ROLE AS A DIRT POOR SCAVENGER 2 AND THUS THE TWO DEVELOP A BOND MAYBE SHE'S TRYING TO REPAIR THE FALCON OR SOMETHING WHICH WOULD SHOW RATHER THAN TELL THAT SHE WANTS TO GET OFF THE PLANET AND THEN FINN KNOWS HOW TO FLY 2 DUE TO SOME FLIGHT KNOWLEDGE BACK DURING BASIC STORM-TROOPER TRAINING

SEE THAT WOULD FEEL MORE SW THAN FINN SAYING DROID PLEASE BECAUSE HE'S BLACK OR REY CHASING HIM FOR NO REASON UNTIL THEY STUMBLE ON THE MILLENNIUM FALCON OF ALL THE BILLIONS OF SHIPS IN THE GALAXY
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING I'M HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM IF YOU'VE REALLY FOLLOWED STAR WARS IN THE LAST YEARS I MEAN THERE'S MOVIES SIGNED BY LUCAS ONE OF THEM BARELY SO BUT ALL THE REST IS PART OF THE LEGENDS IF IT WAS SUCH A PROBLEM HOW COULD YOU ENJOY ALL THE STUFF THAT CAME ASIDE FROM THE MOVIES

IS IT THE FACT THAT LUCAS HAS BASICALLY DISAVOWED THESE MOVIES OR IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FANS THAT WROTE THEM NOW AND THE FANS THAT WROTE THE COMICS THE BOOK AND WORKED ON THE GAMES BEFORE

I JUST BOUGHT TICKETS TO THE SCREENING PST AND HAVE BOUGHT A CHEWBACCA PAJAMA SUIT TO WEAR TO THE MOVIE I WONT BE SEEING IMAX BUT FOR ME THE BEST PART IS THE AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION WHEN WE SEE THE SCROLL
SHIT I HAVENT KEPT UP WITH THIS AND DIDNT KNOW IT WOULD HAPPEN TODAY BUMMED BECAUSE LAST YEAR I GOT TICKETS FOR MY FAMILY AND ME AND THIS TIME I ONLY GOT TWO FOR ME AND MY F SEATS AROUND US WERE TAKEN SO NOW IF MY BROTHER COUSINS GET TICKETS THEY WONT SIT WITH US GUESS THATS A DOWNSIDE TO RESERVED SEATING BUT OH WELL IM EXCITED
GERMAN FAN HERE I JUST BOUGHT MY TICKETS FOR AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE MIDNIGHT SCREENING I AM SO UNBELIEVABLY PUMPED
WELP LADS MY CITY'S MOVIE THEATRE IS NOT PRETTY OR FANCY BUT I AM SO STOKED TO HAVE GOTTEN TICKETS MY BROTHERS AND I WILL BE WATCHING THE FILM IN 2D ON THE FIRST SCREENING IN OUR CITY MY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL
GERMANY TICKETS WERE UP HOURS ALODY STILL GOT THE BEST SEATS ON THURSDAY THEY EVEN OFFERED TWO MIDNIGHTSCREENINGS BUT MY BROTHER IS NOT OLD ENOUGH
IT WAS A BATTLE AND EVENTUALLY HAD TO ACCEPT FANDANGO WOULDN'T BE LOADING TICKETS FOR THIS THEATER OVERCROWDED ATTEMPTS AT GETTING ITS TICKETS I GUESS EVERY OTHER THEATER WAS FINE BUT I MANAGED TO GET DECENT SEATS FOR LINCOLN SQUARE IMAX ON PRAISE BE UNTO FOR BAILING ME OUT
TRIED TO GET TICKETS FOR THE PM IMAX SHOWING AT MY LOCAL THEATER LAST YEAR FOR FFA FOR THE PREMIERE I WAS MINUTES LATE

THIS YEAR GOT THE PM IMAX TICKETS ON THE EVEN THOUGH I WENT ON AN HOUR AFTER THEY RELEASED
FFS I GOT UP EARLY TO GET THE TICKETS ONLY TO SEE THAT MY CINEMA HAD ALREADY RELEASED THE TICKETS NOW I DONT HAVE THE BEST TICKETS IN THE CINEMA FOR THE PREMIERE
GOT MINE LUCKILY NOT GOING OPENING DAY BECAUSE THOSE THINGS WERE SOLD OUT I DID LUCKILY GET TO RESERVE THE BEST SEATS
DOWNSIDE TO BEING IN JAPAN THE TICKETS AREN'T ON SALE HERE YET THE UPSIDE IS THAT THE SHOW IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO BE SOLD OUT NEVERTHELESS I'LL BE GETTING A GROUP TOGETHER FOR WHAT IS RAPIDLY BECOMING AN TRADITION
I'M HAVING A HARDER TIME GETTING THESE TICKETS THAN FOR FFA NEAR ME SOMEHOW ALL OF THE AMC THEATERS ARE SOLD OUT TILL OR PAST CHRISTMAS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

I GOT TICKETS FOR FFA IN UNDER A HALF HOUR I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET TICKETS FOR ROGUE ONE FOR 2 AND A HALF HOURS NOW THIS IS RIDICULOUS

UPDATE FINALLY GOT MY TICKETS IT TOOK 2 HOURS AND MINUTES BUT I FINALLY ACQUIRED TICKETS FOR DECEMBER AT PM UNFORTUNATELY THE SEATS AREN'T GREAT BUT I'LL TAKE ANYTHING AFTER THAT LONG ASS WAIT
THAT WAS WAY MORE PAINLESS THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THEN AGAIN I'M NOT DOING IMAX OR ANYTHING CRAZY
REBELLIONS ARE BUILT ON HOPE HOPE THAT THE TRANSACTION ON MY CARD MEANT THAT I GOT TICKETS
WONDER WHY FANDANGO DIDN'T JUST TURN THE QUEUE SYSTEM ON IMMEDIATELY INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THEIR SERVERS TO MELT DOWN QUEUE SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO GET ME THROUGH THE PROCESS SMOOTHER
THERE ARE ONLY RESERVED SEATING THEATERS NEAR ME

THE ONLY SEATS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASED ARE FOR THE HANDICAPPED

THIS WAS MY ONLY POSSIBLE REACTION HETP
TRANSACTION WENT THROUGH NO CONFIRMATION THOUGH BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO HOURS ALL GOING TO BE WORTH IT TO SEE AYN STEAL SOME DEATH STAR PLANS IN GLORIOUS IMAX
AMC ISN'T SELLING TICKETS AT MY LOCATION GRR
SO THIS IS HOW LIBERTY DIES HETP

OOOO ALAMO DRAFTHOUSE INCORPORATED SOME KIND OF ONLINE QUEUE THING THEY TOOK AWAY THE THURSDAY DATES TIMES AND IT TOOK MINUTES OF RELOADING BEFORE THEY PUT THOSE UP IN THE MEANTIME ALL OTHER CHOWTIMES AND DAYS WERE AVAILABLE

THE PEOPLE WHO CLICKED ON THOSE GOT IN THE QUEUE FIRST GRANTED IT WAS FOR ALL OF THE ALAMO THEATERS NATIONWIDE BUT STILL I HAD TO WAIT MINUTES BEFORE IT WAS MY TIME I ENTERED IT AT OR SO

THANKFULLY SOMEONE NICE ENOUGH POPPED UP ON TWITTER AND SAID THERE WAS NO WAIT TIME ON THE APPARENTLY I ZIPPED RIGHT THROUGH FROM THERE KEPT THE QUEUE GOING TO SEE HOW LONG IT WAS

NOT THE GREATEST SEATS BUT IT'S THE SHOWING WE WANTED
MUCH LIKE LAST YEAR I WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO A SHOWING THE MORNING OF RELEASE IN A LARGE FORMAT THEATER WITH PROBABLY ONLY PEOPLE INSIDE AND IT WILL BE GOOD
PM IMAX 2D SHOWING
FUCKING SCORED THE MOST PERFECT SEATS SO HARD I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS SHOWING IN LET ALONE 2D
2D OR 3D
THIS IS TWO YEARS IN A ROW WHERE I GOT THE TICKETS I WANTED WITHIN 2 MINUTES OF TRYING LAST YEAR THEY TRIED TO GET US WITH LETTING THE TICKET SALES GO UP EARLY I SNIFFED THAT OUT AND THIS YEAR I WAS IN AND OUT OF FANDANGO BY THE FORCE IS STRONG IN MY FAMILY
GOT THE EMAIL RIGHT AS TICKETS WENT ON SALE GOT PUT IN A QUEUE SO OF COURSE EVERYTHING BUT THE FRONT SEATS WERE SOLD OUT FOR THE FIRST SHOWING JUST GOT A TICKET FOR THE INSTEAD WORKED BETTER FOR MY FRIEND ANYWAY I'LL JUST TAKE THE DAY OFF WORK
JUST GOT MY TICKETS TO SEE IT IN IMAX 2D AT THE INDY STATE MUSEUM

SAW FORCE AWAKENS THERE LAST YEAR THERE ISNT A BETTER WAY TO SEE THE MOVIE WORTH THE LONG DRIVE
WTF FANDANGO HAS PUT ME IN LINE FOR AN HOUR IN LINE FOR WHAT DO THEY NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE INTERNET WORKS

WHY THE FUCK DO YOU NEED A QUEUE WHEN ORDERING ON THE INTERNET THAT MAKES NO SENSE
I JUST WATCHED THIS ENTIRE THING AND I KIND OF HATE MYSELF
DANK WILL USE IN FUTURE MARATHONIAN SESSIONS
THIS IS DISGUSTING
R TITLEGORE
I FEEL LIKE A YEAR OLD MADE THIS POST
THATS TERRIFYING
LOOKS LIKE ME WHEN I PUT ON MY TK ARMOR
SO HE'S GOING TO GIVE ME AN INACCURATE DIAGNOSIS
IS THIS APPROVED S
YOUR TALKING LIKE YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE TO THINK THIS IT SEEMS THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THINKING THIS SINCE THEY FOUND OUT VADER WOULD BE IN THE MOVIE I HOPE THEY ARE WRONG THOUGH
IF
I HAVE A FEELING KRENNIC IS GOING TO GET KILLED BY THE REBELS
GOOD ODDS
BASED ON CATALYST I'D SAY IT'S CERTAIN

ALSO THIS LAPSED EU READER THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT BOOK DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED IF YOU FIND YOURSELF ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE THIS
THIS IS A FAIR QUESTION DON'T LET THE KNOW IT ALL WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN AND OF COURSE BOTHER YOU
HER PARENTS ARE SCIENTISTS WHO RESEARCH CRYSTALS SPECIFICALLY KYBERS I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S BEEN CONFIRMED BY SOMEONE IN LUCASFILM BUT IT EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T TELL US IT WOULD JUST MAKE SENSE
YES GOOD CATCH
YES IT IS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
OF COURSE SHE IS
I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY FOR MAKING THE MOST BADASS CHRISTMAS TREE OF ALL TIME
WAKING UP TO THAT WOULD BE HORRIFYING
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU NEARLY SHIT YOURSELF SEEING THAT OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT ON YOUR WAY TO THE BATHROOM
MINI DARTH ON DARTH
OR SO OF THESE

KEEPING IN THE THEME ALL THE WRAPPING HAD TO BE IN DARTH COLORS
TH THUMBNAIL LOOKS LIKE SILHOUETTE FILLED WITH A COSMIC BACKGROUND
AHH DARTH ANGEL PATRON SITH OF CHRISTMAS
IT'S TERRIFYING
LIKE THE SCENE FROM THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS
PFFT LIKE FETT WOULD THINK TWICE
WHY IS HE AFRAID OF HER JUMPING HE HAS A JETPACK AND A FIBER CORD WHIP CABLE ALL HE'D HAVE TO DO IS WRAP HER UP OR JUMP AFTER HERALDRY

EDIT GUYS READ THE SOURCE PAGE HE'S SUPPOSED TO KILL HERALDRY
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THIS SHOWS A BOUNTY HUNTER KNOWN FOR BEING THE BEST HAVING A CHANGE OF HEART MID MISSION THIS IS THE GUY VADER LITERALLY HAD TO TELL NO DISINTEGRATION MEANING HE HAS LITERALLY DISINTEGRATED A TARGET
HOW COULD MAX REBO RESCUE BOLA WHEN SHE WAS EATEN BY THE RANCOR
SOURCE AND MORE
I DIDN'T KILL MY HUSBAND

I DON'T CARE
HERE'S SOME COOL ART

ALL COMMENTS ARE QUIBBLING ABOUT CHARACTER BEHAVIOR
I DON'T THINK SHE'S REALLY INTENDING TO JUMP THE CAPTION SAYS BOBA FETT IS THERE TO KILL HER BUT UNDERESTIMATES HER DIPLOMATIC ABILITIES I THINK FETT IS GETTING THE GUILT TRIP OF HIS LIFE RIGHT NOW SHE'S STANDING ON THE EDGE OF A CLIFF BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T RETREAT ANY FURTHER BEING KILLED TO THE LAST MANUAL IF SHE JUMPS HE'S ACCOMPLISHED HIS MISSION SHE'S PROBABLY LIKE YOU ONLY WORK FOR THE MAN TO PAY THE BILLS YOU COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT YOU COULD HAVE HAD WHAT IT TAKES INSTEAD YOU SOLD OUT TO SOME TWO BIT SITH LORD IT'S A LIVING FETT IT'S A WASTE OF LIFE MOTHMA
REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF THIS SCENE FROM THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS
HEY GUYS THE FACT THAT THE ARTIST HAS YOU ARGUING OVER WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PAINTING THAT MEANS HE DID A GOOD JOB
IT'S IMAGES LIKE THIS ONE THAT ARE CAPABLE OF TELLING SUCH A STORY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD I LOVE IT OP


BUT WHY WOULD THERE BE FLEET TROOPERS THEY'RE ON THE GROUND
HOLY SHIT PEOPLE ITS A COOL ASS DRAWING STOP PICKING IT APART ABOUT HOW FETT WOULDNT DO THIS OR THAT
LAST OF THE MOHICANS ANYONE
WE DON'T FLY BUT WE GLIDE VERY WELL
THAT'S EPIC I L LOVE THE ART STYLE
EH I CAN'T SEE FETT BEING SWAYED BY DIPLOMATIC PROWESS I GET THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SHE'S JUST THAT GOOD KIND OF THING BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD MAKE HIM REACT LIKE THAT
REGARDLESS OF COMPLIANCE WITH CANON FANON ETC I THINK THIS IS A VERY EFFECTIVE PIECE OF STORYTELLING ARTICLE SHE LOOKS TO ME LIKE SHE'S ALMOST DARING HIM TO DO IT A YOU'VE HEARD WHAT I HAVE TO SAY AND NOW DO WHAT YOU WILL MOMENT AND HE CAN'T DO IT NOT NOW NOT TO HER AT LEAST IF YOU ACCEPT THE REALITY THE PIECE GIVES YOU IT BECOMES NOT A QUESTION OF WOULD ULTIMATE FETT HAVE REMORSE AND RAISES THE FAR MORE INTERESTING QUESTION WHAT LED TO THIS REMORSE
HEY LADY YOU LIKE MY NEW GLOVES
THE REAL FRANK
FETT PLEASE STOP

MOTHMA YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I DOUBT YOU EVER WILLIAM

FETT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS THE EMPIRE HAS CHANGED LORD VADER HAS CHANGED IT

MOTHMA HE MAY HAVE KILLED THE EMPEROR MANY OF MY FORMER ALLIES MAY HAVE JOINED HIM BUT I WILL NOT I KNOW THE EVIL IN HIS HEART AND IN YOURS IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN CLEANSE SO EASILY

FETT I KNOW I HAVE DONE MANY HORRIBLE THINGS BUT TALKING WITH SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS IN SOMETHING BETTER I COULDN'T DO THIS ANYMORE PLEASE COME BACK HERE

MOTHMA YOU WERE FORGED BY WAR I PITY YOU I WISH YOU COULD HAVE GROWN UP WITHOUT ALL THIS FIGHTING BUT I CANNOT LIVE WITH EVIL GOOD BYE
PUTTING DOWN THE LAST OF THE REBEL TROOPERS DEFENDING HIS QUARRY BOBA FETT STEPS FORWARD BLASTER LEVELED AT A MON MOTHMA NO WHERE ELSE TO GO SENATOR

MON MOTHMA SMILES SADLY AND PEERS OUT OVER THE CLIFF I AM NOT WITHOUT OPTIONS

BOBA FETT TAKES A STEP FORWARD BOUNTY ON YOU IS DEAD OR ALIVE YOU JUMP I STILL GET PAYED

MON MOTHMA SHAKES HER HEAD NO BOUNTY HUNTER YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT IF I PLUMMET HERE YOU WILL NEVER RETRIEVE MY BODY AND THE EMPIRE WILL USE THAT AS AN EXCUSE NOT TO PAY YOU YOUR DUE BUT I AM NOT EAGER TO DIE AND AN ACCORD CAN BE REACHED

FETT STANDS IMPLACABLE FINE SAY YOUR PEACE

MY LIFE IS IN SERVICE TO THE MEN AND WOMEN YOU HAVE KILLED HERE TODAY AND THE MANY LEFT ALIVE I WILL COME WITH YOU WILLINGLY SHOULD YOU AGREE TO KILL NO MORE OF MY PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM TIME TO EVACUATE BEFORE TIPPING OFF THE EMPIRE SAYS MON MOTHMA HANDS AT HER SIDES BALANCE PRECARIOUS

THE BOUNTY IS ON YOU I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR SOLDIERS WE HAVE AN ACCORD SAYS THE HUNTER COLDLY

MON MOTHMA STEPS FORWARD PLACING A FOOT ON LOOSE STONE WHICH CLATTERS AWAY AS SHE SLIPS SLIGHTLY BOBA FETT DROPS HIS WEAPON IN ORDER TO MAKE READY TO LUNGE FOR HER STOPPING HIMSELF WHEN SHE STABILIZES HE MOTIONS WITH HIS HANDS EASY NOW

SUDDENLY ATTENTION IS CAUGHT BY THE SOUND OF APPROACHING SOLDIERS FROM BEHIND MON MOTHMA USES THIS MOMENT TO DIVE FORWARD SNATCHING UP THE BOUNTY DISCARDED WEAPON AND AIMING UP AT HIM FROM THE FLOOR

THE BARGAIN HAS CHANGED BOUNTY HUNTER PRAY I DO NOT ALTER IT ANY FURTHER SAYS MON MOTHMA WITH A HARD EXPRESSION

NEXT TIME SENATOR I WON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF LETTING YOU TALK WITH THAT BOBA FETT STEPS OFF THE LEDGE USING HIS JET PACK TO ESCAPE TO SAFETY
WHAT'S THE BACK STORY HERE
YOU'RE NO GOOD TO ME DEAD
I DIDN'T KILL MY MOFF
GREAT DRAWING BUT I DONT THINK FETT WOULD KILL A SHIPLOAD OF PEOPLE THEN SUDDENLY HAVE A WHAT HAVE I DONE MOMENT RIGHT AS THE JOB WOULD BE FINISHED
BOBA FETT PROBABLY BURNED OWEN AND BARU ALIVE SO I STAND WITH EVERYONE BITCHING ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR HERE
WHY WOULD HE HESITATE DOES HE KNOW HER OR SOMETHING
IS THIS BY THE SAME ARTISTS THAT DO VENTURE BROTHERS
BUTTER FINGERS I CAN'T BELIEVE I KEEP DROPPING MY RIFLE JUST BEFORE I'M ABOUT TO SHOOT MY TARGET SO EMBARRASSING
BOBA IS INSPECTING HIS INVISIBLE SKATEBOARD
I WISH YOU WOULD STEP BACK FROM THAT LEDGE MOTHMA
HER HANDS ARE FUCKED UP
THAT'S MORE OF A COME HERE SO I CAN CHOKE YOU
THE ONLY WAY TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS BY ASSUMING THE TWO HAVE A RELATION BETWEEN EACH OTHER HENCE THE PLEADING GESTURE
AND I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HECK THE EMPIRE AND THE REBELS ARE FIGHTING ABOUT
NICE COOL VERY NICE
COOL ART BUT BOBA WOULDN'T BECOME HORRIFIED LIKE THIS
SO
THIS MAKES NO SENSE
THAT LOOKS LIKE FRANCIS OF THE FILTH
COOL
IT'S LIKE POTTERY
THE DEATH STAR AND STARKVILLE BASE USE TWO DIFFERENT AND ALMOST UNRELATED TECHNOLOGIES

THE DEATH STAR USED GIANT GYBER CRYSTALS LIGHTSABER CRYSTALS TO GENERATE EACH INDIVIDUAL BEAM THIS TYPE OF WEAPON ALLOWED MULTIPLE SMALLER BEANS TO BE CHANGED INTO A SINGLE LARGER BEAM DUE TO THE UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF LIGHTSABERS AT THE COST OF MASSIVE POWER CONSUMPTION

STARKVILLE BASE HOWEVER UTILIZED THE POWER AND MASS OF STARS TO FIRE A SINGLE BEAM OF SUPERHEATED PLASMA AT INCREDIBLE SPEEDS THIS BEAM WAS PRODUCED MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT BLASTERS USED TIANA GAS TO CREATE THEIR BOLTS

TL R THE DEATH STAR WAS A GIANT SPACE LIGHTSABER STARKVILLE BASE WAS A GIANT SPACE BLASTER
WELL DAMN THAT'S KINDA NEAT
THE EARTHSTAR ACTUALLY SHOT A LASER STARKVILLE SWALLOWED A STAR WHAT IT FIRED WAS A STREAM OF PLASMA
I SOMEHOW NEVER MADE THIS CONNECTION
IT'S ANOTHER DEATH STAR
NO IT'S BIGGER AND IT CAN BLOW UP FIVE PLANET AT ONCE
MARGARITA AND CHICKEN WINGS BEFORE THE FILM CHEESECAKE AND COFFEE AFTERWARDS

MARATHON THE FILMS BEFORE

MARATHON THE MOVIES AGAIN

THEN AFTER THE MOVIE SPEND HOURS ON REDDIN READING WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THOUGHT OF THE MOVIE
I LIKE TO GO OUT FOR A FEW DRINKS THE NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO THE MOVIES IT SOUNDS KIND OF ODD BUT THE ALCOHOL DRIES ME OUT AND EVEN WITH A BIG GULP IN THE THEATER WHICH I LOVE I WON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM UNTIL THE MOVIE IS OVER ALSO I SHOULD SAY I'M NOT GETTING LIT UP THE NIGHT BEFORE JUST A FEW DRINKS TO SHARE IN THE EXCITEMENT WITH MY FRIENDS
I WILL PURCHASE A TICKET PROCEED TO GET THE HIGHEST SEAT POSSIBLE AND WATCH THE MOVIE
SATURDAY DECEMBER PAGE M GOING ALONE
IMAX 3D GO BIG OR STAY HOME DECEMBER GOING WITH GIRLFRIEND FRIEND AND MY SISTER PROBABLY LINING UP A FEW HOURS EARLY SO I GET SEATS RIGHT IN THE CENTER

EDIT I THINK I KNOW WHICH THEATER YOU'RE GOING TO I'M GOING TO CINETOPIA WITH RESERVED SEATING AS WELL

I HAVE BRACES SO I CAN'T EAT POPCORN BUT I'LL DEFINITELY SMUGGLE IN SOME CANDY AND DRINKS BECAUSE MOVIE THEATER SNACKS ARE TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE
EVERY TIME I'VE SEEN A STAR WARS MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S BEEN WITH MY MOM SHE'S THE ONE THAT GOT ME AND MY SISTER INTO IT WHEN WE WERE LITTLE I'D GO SEE IT OPENING NIGHT BUT I DON'T WANT TO RUIN THAT TRADITION SO I'M GOING TO WAIT UNTIL I GO HOME FOR CHRISTMAS I'M THINKING OF GETTING A BUNCH OF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS IMAX 3D TICKETS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT BUT I STILL NEED A HEAD COUNT OF WHO'S GOING
MY DAD INTRODUCED ME TO STAR WARS AT A YOUNG AGE IN THE I'VE SEEN EVERY SINGLE STAR WARS THAT HAS COME OUT IN THEATERS SINCE WITH HIM ON OPENING DAY

THIS YEAR HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH HEART FAILURE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE OF THESE WERE GOING TO GET

IT'S A SIMPLE ONE STAR WARS BY ITSELF MAKES ME EMOTIONAL BUT NOW IT'S ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL

I CAN'T WAIT
I'M GETTING BACK HOME FROM A TRIP AROUND I'M SLEEPING UNTIL OR SO I'LL PROBABLY WORK UNTIL AROUND THEN GO TO THE THEATER AND WATCH THE MOVIE I BOUGHT FOUR TICKETS I'M NOT SURE WHO IS AVAILABLE TO GO WITH ME YET

I'LL WEAR WHATEVER I WORE TO WORK THAT DAY I'LL PROBABLY GET POPCORN AND A DRINK SINCE I WON'T HAVE HAD ANY DINNER I'LL EAT AND DRINK MOST OF IT DURING THE TRAILERS

IF THEY'RE UP FOR IT WE'LL PROBABLY GET A DRINK OR FOOD AFTERWARD

I DON'T TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY
WHY DO PEOPLE FEEL THE URGE TO EAT DURING A MOVIE CAN'T YOU GO WITHOUT FOOD FOR 2 HOURS ESPECIALLY THE OVERPRICED GARBAGE THEY SELL CAN'T YOU HAVE SOME BEFORE YOU HIT THE THEATER

NO HATE JUST WONDERING
I'M GOING DEC PM WITH ONE OTHER PERSON I'LL BE WEARING THE SAME STAR WARS SHIRT I'VE WORN TO EVERY OTHER PREMIERE IT'S OVER YEARS OLD AND ORIGINALLY BLACK BUT NOW GRAY A STAR WARS SKIRT AND MY YODA BACKPACK

I'LL BE WATCHING EP 2 AND IN THE DAYS BEFORE AND BRINGING LOTS OF TISSUES SINCE I GET EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL THE MOMENT I SEE THE A LONG TIME AGO IN A GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY SCREEN AND THE ENTIRE THEATER STARTS CHEERING WHEN STAR WARS FLASHES ON THE SCREEN
ME AND THE EX ARE STILL BEST FRIENDS AND MOST LIKELY I'LL TAKE HIM WE ARE BIG STAR WARS FANS
I'LL PROBABLY GO ALONE FOR THE FIRST SHOWING ALSO AND THEN WITH THE SO THE SECOND TIME CO WORKERS FRIENDS OTHER TIMES AFTER
OH DUDE THAT SOUNDS AWESOME

I STARTED A TRADITION WITH MY BROTHER AND COUSIN LAST YEAR WHICH IS TO SEE EVERY NEW CHAPTER IN THE SAGA TOGETHER MY GRANDPA CAME LAST YEAR AND WILL PROBABLY COME AGAIN THIS TIME FFA WAS THE FIRST MOVIE HE'D SEEN IN A THEATRE
WE HAVE A THREE YEAR OLD AND A SEVEN MONTH OLD SO I'M HAVING TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUE TO BABYSITTING LOGISTICS TAKING THE BOYS TO MEET SANTA FIRST OF ALL THEN DROPPING THEM OFF TO THEIR GRANDPARENTS WHILE MYSELF AND MRS JMBTROOPER GO AND SEE THE FILM

WE WILL PROBABLY GO TO A RESTAURANT AFTERWARDS AND SHARE A BOTTLE OR TWO OF WINE OVER THE COURSE OF THE EVENING DISCUSSING THE MOVIE AND ALL IN ALL JUST ENJOYING A LONG OVERDUE DATE NIGHT ACTUALLY WE WON'T DO THAT LAST BIT AT ALL WE'LL JUST RUSH BACK AFTERWARDS TO PICK THE KIDS UP AS THE BABYSITTING COLLATERAL IS QUITE LOW THEN BACK TO CHANGING NAPPIES AND PICKING DRIED WEETABIX OUT OF THE CARPET AND STEPPING ON LEGO WELL YOU DID ASK
I WENT AT MIDNIGHT FOR THE PREQUEL AND EP VII WITH ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS WHO'S ALSO A BIG FAN FRIENDS SINCE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYED ALL THE VIDEO GAMES THE CARD GAME PLAY NOW UNFORTUNATELY I'M IN AFGHANISTAN THIS TIME SO THAT WON'T HAPPEN STILL DON'T KNOW THE PLAN OF HOW I'LL SEE IT MIGHT JUST HAVE TO BE ON A FLASH DRIVE ON MY COMPUTER WITH SOME HEADPHONES

AND NOW I'VE MADE MYSELF SAD
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DESCRIBED IS MY DREAM NIGHT I MIGHT FOLLOW SUIT THEN TAKE THE FAMILY AT THE WEEKEND YOU KNOW THANK YOU KIND STRANGER
BBB LET ME GO DIG HOLES IN MY BACKYARD FOR STAR WARS TOYS
I KNOW THAT MY IG AND ACTION FIGURES ARE BURIED IN MY GARDEN SOMEWHERE
HOLY WOW WHAT A BEAUTIFUL KENNER CHEWIE
WAS IT ORIGINALLY YOURS OR DID YOU JUST FIND IT BY LUCK

POOR CHEWIE LOST HIS LEG
LEAKED ACTION FIGURE OF EPISODE CHEWBACCA
BEGUN THE TICKET WAR HAS
STOLEN FROM TWITTER

ALL YOU NERDS TRYING TO BUY ROGUE ONE TICKETS ONLINE NEED TO GO TO BED SO I CAN BUY ROGUE ONE TICKETS ONLINE AND GO TO BED
THIS ONE GOES THERE THAT ONE GOES THERE I SAID GIVE ME THE HYDROSPANNER




THAT WASN'T A BLASTER

LEIA HAN GET OVER HERE QUICK

HAN PEOPLE THEY'RE BUYING TICKETS ALL AT ONCE

LEIA YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO BUY THEM NOW ARE YOU

HAN THEY'LL BE CRAZY TO FOLLOW US WOULDN'T THEY
I ALSO GOT THIS ONE HETP A FEW TIMES AT LEAST THEY HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR
I DONT HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR ANY TICKETING SITES JUST LIKE LAST YEAR ITS GONNA BE GATEWAY ERRORS LEFT AND RIGHT I WOULD LOVE TO BE PROVED WRONG THOUGH

I GOT MY SEATS AGAIN RESERVED SEATING NO WAITING IN LINE
THIS IS WORSE THEN I EXPECTED
I NEED THE FORCE TO HELP ME BUY THIS GODDAMN
FINALLY GOT 2 FOR NAVY PIER IMAX LASER WITHIN MINS NOT BAD
JUST BOUGHT TWO AIX IN THE SHOWCASE APP I WAS JUST SETTING UP BUT IT WENT THROUGH RECEIPT TO CONFIRM
OUR THEATER HAS ITS OWN SITE TO SELL TICKETS TOOK ALL OF TWO MINUTES TO CRASH
WHILE FANDANGO WAS DOWN JUST LIKE LAST YEAR I WAS ABLE TO GET MY TICKETS OFF MOVIETICKETS WITH NO ERROR'S OR PROBLEMS EVEN IF THIS ISN'T FFA LEVEL HYPED FANDANGO HONESTLY SHOULD OF BEEN BETTER PREPARED FOR SUCH A HEAVY LOAD
I HAVE FOR IMAX IN EL PASO ALREADY
INTERESTING AFTER PICKING MY RESERVED SEATS AND TRYING TO PAY IT CRASHED OF COURSE AND LOST MY ORDER THEN WHEN FINALLY WAS ABLE TO GET BACK IN I WAS PUT IN SOME SORT OF FANDANGO QUEUE THING THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT MADE ME WAIT MINS COUNTING DOWN THEN ONCE I GOT THROUGH THERE IT WORKED A LOT BETTER AND I GOT SLIGHTLY WORSE SEATS

WONDER WHY THEY DIDN'T JUST TURN THE QUEUE SYSTEM ON RIGHT AWAY
I WAS HONESTLY NOT EXPECTING ANY TRAFFIC FOR ROGUE ONE I WAS LIKE AW YOU CAN WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND GET GOOD SEATS BUT THEN I GO NAH BE A NERD AND STAY UP

I WAS THERE AT CDT AND I GOT SHIT TICKETS LIKE THERE WERE NO SEATS TAKEN I CLICKED ON MY SEATS IT SAID THEY WERE TAKEN AND HOLY SHIT SEATS WERE GONE

SO NOW I SIT ON THE FRONT ROW

I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S WORTH IT
IT TOOK ME ALMOST HOURS TO GET FFA TICKETS LAST YEAR I HAD ZERO ISSUES GETTING TICKETS FOR THIS MOVIE TOOK SECONDS
TOOK ME MINUTES MY COMPUTER WAS SLOW AS FUCK SO I HAD TO GET ON MY PHONE AND DO IT
TOOK ME AN HOUR TO GET THOSE TICKETS

A LIE
DELETED
THE CAKE IS ADORABLE
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A SHOWDOWN AT ALL VADER WOULD SLAUGHTER HIM AND ANYONE ELSE FROM THE MAIN CAST TO GET IN HIS WAY IN OTHER WORDS YES PLEASE
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS HAVE VADER PLAY AROUND WITH CHIRRUP AND THEN SHOW HIM THE TRUE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE THEN DEMOLISH HIM
YES I WOULD BUT I WANT IT TO LAST FIFTEEN SECONDS BEFORE VADER IS WALKING OVER HIS CORPSE TO KILL THE OTHER REBELS
THE ONLY INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE SHOWDOWN WOULD BE WHAT INTERESTING WAY THEY WOULD HAVE VADER KILL HIM IN UNDER SECONDS BECAUSE THATS ABOUT AS LONG AS THE FIGHT WOULD BE FROM BEGINNING TO END
EXTREMELY POWERFUL DARK SIDE USER WITH LIGHTSABER VS DUDE WITH STICK

VADER WOULD KILL HIM IN LIKE 2 SECONDS AFTER BAZE GETS SLAUGHTERED CHIRRUP WOULD JUST DO THIS AND THE SAME OUTCOME WOULD HAPPEN
NOT REALLY I'D PROBABLY END UP BEING ANGRY AT WHY LORD VADER DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY SLAUGHTER HIM IF THEY DO FACE OFF AND VADER PULLS HIM INTO A FORCE CHOKE AND THEN CUTS HIS HEAD OFF WELL THEN YES I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT
VADER NEEDS TO KILL AT LEAST ONE MAIN CHARACTER NOT JUST A BUNCH OF REDSHIRTS AND IT WOULD ENHANCE HIS MENACE FOR HIM TO KILL THE BEST FIGHTER
CYBER MONDAY FTW OKAY REDDIN WHICH GAMES SHOULD I BUY

EDIT HOLY SITH MYSTERIES OF THE SITH IS ON SALE FOR SEVENTY FIVE CENTS
I JUST GOT THE STAR WARS COLLECTION WHICH WAS FOR GAMES ALMOST OFF THERE'S ALSO THE CLASSICS COLLECTION WHICH IS A MORE GAMES FOR
AYN AND CASSIAN WERE DEFINITELY IN THE PLACE WHERE THE DEATH STAR PLANS ARE KEPT AT I BELIEVE THIS ALSO CONFIRMS WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT HALLWAY AYN WAS IN AT THE END OF THE TEASER TRAILER IT LEADS TO THE ROOM WITH THE PLANS I ALSO THINK THAT DOOR THE BEAT UP STORM-TROOPER NEXT TO LEADS TO THAT ROOM
INSIDE OF THE DEATH STAR IN THE UNIFORM LOOKS SO SICK CAN'T WAIT
NO WAY THAT ISN'T LARKIN AT
IF IT LASTS LONGER THAN FOUR HOURS GO TO THE DAMN DOCTOR HOLY SHIT
I'M PREDICTING IT NOW THIS TRAILER HAS MORE VADER BREATHS THAN THE MOVIE
I WONDER IF THIS IS GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE DEALS WHERE THEY HYPE UP VADER BEING IN THE MOVIE BUT TURNS OUT ITS ONLY FOR LIKE MINUTES
THAT SCREAM TOWARDS THE END IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING NEW FOR STAR WARS DEFINITELY GIVES IT THAT WAR FEEL TO IT
PAO IS GOING TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS
THAT WAS DEFINITELY LARKIN AT THE BEGINNING I'VE NEVER FELT THE AIR LEAVE MY LUNGS SO QUICKLY OVER A SHOT OF THE BACK OF SOMEONE'S HEAD NO LESS

CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MY HOMEBODY AGAIN
THAT MUSIC THO
KRENNIC IS GONNA STEAL THE SHOW IN THIS MOVIE
IMPERIAL MARCH
OK THIS LOOKS COOLER THAN THE FORCE AWAKENS AND I SAW THE FORCE AWAKENS TIME IN CINEMA
QUITE SIMILAR TO THE EPISODE 2 TEASER TRAILER
PROBABLY GOT THE INSPIRATION FROM THERE OR IT'S A NOD PERHAPS
THE DELIVERY OF MAY THE FORCE BE WITH US SEEMED DIFFERENT IN THIS SPOT THAN THE OTHER TRAILERS I HOPE THEY DIDN'T MESS WITH IT IN THE FINAL CUT
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
I JUST REALIZED THAT THE PLANET LOOKING AT IS SARIF
HEAVY BREATHING
ALSO IN THE REFLECTION SHOT I'M PRETTY SURE THOSE AGGI BOOTS TO THE RIGHT ARE NEW AND THEY MORE THAN LIKELY BELONG TO LARKIN AS WELL
WELL I THINK WE'LL HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF HAVING MORE VADER SCREEN TIME THAN WE DID WITH LUKE IN EPISTLE
MY FEAR FOR THIS MOVIE LIKE EPISODE WITH BARELY A VISIT WITH LUKE AND EPISODE IS THAT WE GET JUST 2 MINUTES IF THAT OF VADER I WANT MORE VADER REBELS HAS BEEN PRETTY GOOD IN HOW IT HANDLED VADER IN SEASON 2 BUT I WANT SOME MORE ON SCREEN TIME
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE SEEING THE WEIRD GREY BOX ON THE RIGHTMOST IMPERIAL WALKER AT RIGHT

EDIT MY EYES SUCK SORT OF LOOKS LIKE THEY FORGOT TO ADD THE SIDE IN WITH VISUAL FX BUT MAYBE ITS SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN
THIS IS THE BEST TV SPOT YET
MY GOD THE NEW FUCKING IMPERIAL MARCH SOUNDTRACK IS CRAZY
I LOVED MOST OF THESE TRAILERS BUT THIS ONE TAKES THE CAKE
THIS ONE GAVE ME LEGIT GOOSEBUMPS
THIS IS THE BEST TV SPOT I'VE SEEN
YOU THINK MAYBE VADER IS FORCE LIFTING SOMETHING IN THAT SHOT WITH THE WEIRD HAND GESTURE WE KEEP SEEING MAYBE A DEAD BODY I DON'T KNOW
THEY COULD HAVE JUST RECAST HIM I MEAN WE WOULD ALL UNDERSTAND CHARLES DANCE WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT LARKIN HE HAS THE LOOK AND THE SCOWLING SARCASM DOWN PRETTY WELL
I'VE BEEN WANTING A TRAILER LIKE THIS SINCE ROGUE ONE WAS ANNOUNCED
IF THAT WASN'T LARKIN PLAYED BY CHARLES DANCE THEN I'LL BE A UNCLE
SHIT THAT WAS BILLY I JUST SAW HIM LAST WEEK AT THE FAMILY REUNION
NOPE NOT JUST YOU

THE NEAR THE TOP IS INTERESTING BUT BELOW THAT I GET

ASB MS HAH IUYHJKKPLMN

WHICH OBVIOUSLY MAKES SO SENSE EVEN IF YOU PUT IT BACKWARDS

BASED ON SOME OF THE PATTERNS H NEXT TO J TWICE DOUBLE K IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORD IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S ALSO BEEN PUT THROUGH A SUBSTITUTION CIPHER EVER LETTER SHIFTED TO THE LEFT FOR EXAMPLE BUT MORE LIKELY IT'S JUST RANDOM GIBBERISH MEANT TO LOOK STAR

IT'S A SHAME I'VE SEEN SOME VERY AMUSING EASTER EGGS HIDDEN IN AUREBESH BEFORE
ASB MA HAH IPYHJKKULN

HDJKD KD BSJ DKL

ITS GIBBERISH
NOPE YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
MY WIFE AND I HAVE NEARLY IDENTICAL HTTPS TATTOOS JUST REVERSED AS TO WHOM HAS WHICH REBEL SCUM
I HOPE YOUR GIRLFRIEND REPORTS YOU TO THE AUTHORITIES ASAP WE CAN T
TOLERATE PEOPLE SYMPATHIZING WITH TERRORISTS

YOUR FINGER NAILS ARE DISTRACTING SORRY
HEY LOOK GUYS IT'S LOST STARS
AAARGHHHH THE NAILS THOUGH
HEY I HAVE A RELATED TAT
WHY IS THE MIDDLE OF THE A CIRCLE
CHECK THIS OUT U HALCYON I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS HIS DESIGN
ALL I SEE IS FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA JUST GOT TO CONVINCE MY WIFE TO DO IT NOW
I READ THIS WRONG AT FIRST AND WAS LIKE DAMN YOUR GIRLFRIENDS HAND LOOKS LIKE SHIT LOL
MATCHING TATTOOS WITH SOMEONE THAT'S NOT LEGALLY BOUND TO STICK WITH YOU THAT'S A BIG RISK TED LET'S SEE IF IT PAYS OFF
GOOD JOB ON HAVING A GIRLFRIEND
THAT'S AWESOME AND CUTE
THEY LOOK AWESOME
THAT LINE WORK IS INCREDIBLY WELL DONE I LOVE THEM
YOU MUST BE VERY HUNGRY
WOW IT LOOKS LIKE A SQUARE POKÉBALL
OKAY BUT THEY WERE JUST MOVIES MAN
KIND OF WEAK TATTOOS HONESTLY I DON'T MEAN TO BE MEAN BUT IT'S LIKE GETTING A STICK FIGURE DARTH VADER THE REAL THING WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER
THOSE ARE SOME COOL TATTOOS LADIES
THATS DOPE I WANT ONE NOW
YOU JUST GOT SUPER EXCITED IS ALL WE ALL FEEL YOU
JOHN DEERE STANDARD TIRES ARE FRONT AND REAR

EDIT AH CRAP
AWESOME PICTURE IT'S INSANE THAT KALO IS THE THIRD BIG ANTAGONIST OF THE MOVIE FRANCHISE THAT LOOKS SUCH ICONIC
LOOKING BETTER THAN IN THE MOVIE
MACHINES CLEANING MACHINES
I ALWAYS LOVE THESE LITTLE BACKGROUND THINGS THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS NOTICE THEY MAKE THE WORLD OF STAR WARS FEEL THAT MUCH MORE REAL
THOSE DROIDS DO PROBABLY HAVE A NAME IN CANON AND WE WILL MOST LIKELY SEE A COMIC ABOUT THEM SOON


REMINDS ME OF DETAILS LIKE THIS
WHY IS A BATTLE DROID DOING THE WORK OF A MAINTENANCE DROID
COOL FIND NEVER NOTICED THAT THE ATTENTION TO DETAILS LIKE THIS IS REALLY AWESOME IN THE STAR WARS MOVIES
I WONDER IF THOSE TWO WERE BITCHING ABOUT THEIR JOBS LIKE EVERY OTHER DROID IN STAR WARS SEEMS TO
THANKS GEORGE
THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON ITS SO DENSE
THAT'S AWESOME
I REALLY HOPE WE GET DETAILS LIKE THIS IN THE UPCOMING MOVIES IT'S SO NEAT
IT'S A PRETTY AWESOME AND VERY STAR WARS SHOT
THIS OPENING SCENE MEANT A LOT TO ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS COOL THAT THE JEDI FLED AND HAD TO SNEAK AROUND LIKE NINJAS ABOARD THE SHIP I WOULD PLAY THE 1ST LEVEL OVER AND OVER ON TPM PLAYSTATION GAME
EH I THINK THE SCENERY IS IMPRESSIVE BUT I'D HAVE GIVEN MY RIGHT HAND IF GEORGE HAD NOT HIRED A COUPLE OF THOSE DIGITAL ARTISTS AND HIRED ONE ACTUAL WRITER FOR THE FRANCHISE INSTEAD
AS MUCH AS I LIKE TO MAKE FUN OF THE SO DENSE QUOTE FROM LUCAS I WILL ADMIT I THINK ALL OF THE DETAIL PUT INTO EACH SHOT IS NICE TO SEE
ITS COOL LITTLE TOUCH SHAME THEY DIDN'T PUT AS MUCH EFFORT INTO THE STORY THE CHARACTERS MAINTAINING CANNON THE EFFECTS OR THE NOT HAVING JAR JAR FUCKING BANKS

IF THEY DID THE PREQUEL COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FILMS INSTEAD OF POOR IMITATIONS OF A BRILLIANT FRANCHISE THEY DO TO STAR WARS WHAT ASYLUM FILMS DO TO EVERYTHING THEY RIP OFFICIAL

THE ONLY THING THAT REDEEMS TPM IS THE MUSIC DUEL OF THE FATES IS SUCH AN EPIC PIECE OF MUSIC
ITS A DROID ON A TANK WHETHER HE'S CLEANING IT OR FIXING IT IS UNCLEAR HONESTLY THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IMPRESSIVE ABOUT THIS
THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I STILL ASSOCIATE STAR WARS AND ESPECIALLY THE PREQUEL WITH EXTRAS THAT LOOK COMPLETELY USELESS IN PARTICULAR EVERY EXTERNAL SHOT IN TPM ON TATTOOING WITH SCORES OF EXTRAS JUST MILLING ABOUT AND THAT MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS WHITE ANDROID IN ANH
I DO WATCH MY FAVORITE CLIPS OFTEN BUT I USUALLY ONLY WATCH THE MOVIES IN ENTIRETY A FEW TIMES A YEAR OR WHEN THE OCCASIONAL STAR WARS MARATHON COMES ON TV I DO HOWEVER FREQUENTLY READ LORE AND WATCH THE CARTOONS SO I'M ALWAYS KEEPING UP WITH STAR WARS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
ABOUT ONCE A YEAR ALL THE WAY THROUGH SPREAD OUT OVER SEVERAL DAYS AND THEN SELECT SCENES HERE AND THERE
I WATCH CHUNKS OF THEM AND OFTEN ASTEROID CHASE SCENE TRENCH RUN FINN AND REY ESCAPE ZAKKEU TATTOOING

I HAVE A VERSION OF THE THEATRICAL RELEASE OF IV THAT I PICK AWAY AT TOO SINCE I SAW IT IN THEATRES IN IT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME
FIRST DAY OF SUMMER VACATION BREAK OR MAY THE 4TH
IF FANEDITS COUNT THEN WHENEVER I FINISH RENDERING MY FANEDITS AND REALIZE I SCREWED UP AGAIN AND HAVE TO START ALL OVER

IF NOT THEN PROBABLY ONCE EVERY MONTHS WITH FRIENDS
THE OT AT LEAST YEARLY THE REST OF THE FRANCHISE LESS SO
EVERY OTHER MONTH AT LEAST I AM SUCH A DORK
I'M CURRENTLY RUNNING THROUGH A BUNCH OF OF THE PT TRYING TO PICK OUT WHICH ONE OF EACH FILM I CAN TOLERATE THE BEST SO RIGHT NOW I'M WATCHING A TON OF STAR WARS
IT'S A BUMMER MASTER P DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO ANY OF THE FILMS HE MUST HAVE FLUNKED OUT OF SWORD SCHOOL
FOR THOSE THAT HAVE NEVER MET HIM THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE OF TYPICAL GEORGE TAKES A LOT TO RATTLE HIS CAGE GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR
TAKE THAT DAVID PROWSE
SOME CONTEXT UNEXPECTED BIRTHDAY GIFT
MEN IN BLACK
SHE HAD A BRITISH ACCENT THEN
VADER

2 KICKING

ASS
DARTH VADER WIELD HIS LIGHTSABER
2 A COUPLE STAR WARS REBELS CHARACTER CAMEOS
ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS DIE IN THE END

GIACCHINO MESSING UP THE MUSIC

THAT'S REALLY ALL I DON'T WANT
AND POWERFUL VADER

2 DOING SOME STUFF

SOMEBODY MAKES A JOKE ABOUT STORM-TROOPER HAVING TERRIBLE AIM ONLY TO GET SHOT IN THE HEAD BY A DEATH TROOPER AND THE DEATH TROOPER GIVES A I'M SORRY WHAT WERE YOU SAYING HEAD TILT AND SHOULDER SHRUG DIRECTLY IN THE CAMERA
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN PTSD MOMENT
2 MELEE COMBAT
SPACE BATTLE NOT OVER A DEATH STAR
AT AT DESTROY REBEL SCUM
IMPERIALS EXECUTING CITIZENS
DO WANT

COOL NEW VEHICLES AND SPACESHIPS THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ANY STAR WARS MOVIE OF COURSE
A SPACE BATTLE WHERE CAPITAL SHIPS GET TO DO SOMETHING YES I KNOW THIS IS A LONG SHOT I CAN DREAM CAN'T I
ONE OF OUR HEROES TO BE REVEALED AS A BOTAN SPY BUT NONE OF THEM ARE BETHANKS YOU SAY EXACTLY

DO NOT WANT

THE HEROES SURVIVING THE END OF THE MOVIE BUT WINDING UP IMPRISONED ON THE DEATH STAR OR LANDING ON ALDERMAN SOME PEOPLE HAVE SERIOUSLY SUGGESTED THIS AND IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA
ANY OVERT SHOUT OUTS OR REFERENCES TO THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY FFA HAD FAR TOO MANY OF THESE AND USED UP ALL OF ROGUE ONE'S
ANY EGOISMS IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEY'LL SHOW UP FORTUNATELY BUT IT WOULD BE RATHER IRRITATING IF THEY DID
VADER
VADER
BETHANKS
BAIL ORGANA CAMEO
VADER
2 VADER
VADER
KALO REN DIES HE SUCKS
PROBABLY NOT THE SHEER HYPE THAT WAS THERE FOR STAR WARS STARTING BACK UP AGAIN JUST ISN'T THERE FOR ROGUE ONE
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE I REALLY WISH THEY WOULD THOUGH WHEN IS THE NEXT TIME VADER WILL GET TIME ON THE BIG SCREEN MIGHT AS WELL NOT WASTE LORD PRESENCE
I USED TO BELIEVE SO BUT I SEE IT AS UNLIKELY THIS VADER WILL BE IN LINE WITH THE ONE IN ANH HE'D RELY MORE ON THE FORCE AND WHAT HE CAN DO WITH IT RATHER THAN A LIGHTSABER IN THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY VADER ONLY TOOK IT OUT WHEN FACING JEDI I MEAN HE EASILY COUNTERED BLASTS WITH HIS HANDS THE FORCE I DO THINK HE WILL KILL SOMEONE WITH THE FORCE AND POSSIBLY A PROTAGONIST HOWEVER
POSSIBILITY SURE THE MOVIE HASN'T COME OUT YET SO ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE THAT BEING SAID I'M NOT HOLDING OUT A WHOLE LOT OF HOPE THAT WE WILL SEE VADER IN MUCH IF ANY ACTION KEEP YOUR EXPECTATIONS LOW AND YOU WILL NEVER BE DISAPPOINTED
DON'T EXPECT TO SEE HIS LIGHTSABER AT ALL AND MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES OF SCREEN TIME

THEN YOU WILL BE FINE
I STILL HOPE WE DO GET THE VADER USING AND FORCE LIFTING CORPSES TO USE AS A SHIELD FIGHT SCENE
I'M NOT EXPECTING A FIGHT SCENE BUT CONSIDERING HOW SKEPTICAL AND UNIMPRESSED WITH THE DEATH STAR HE WAS IN ANH I'M WONDERING WHAT HIS ROLE WILL BE
AT THE CELEBRATION ANAHEIM PANEL GARETH EDWARDS SAID THERE WOULD BE NO LIGHTSABERS IN THE MOVIE

NOW THAT WAS RIGHT BEFORE FILMING WAS GETTING STARTED AND THINGS CAN CHANGE

AS OF NOW I'M WALKING IN EXPECTING VADER NOT TO GET INTO A BIG FIGHT MAYBE CHOKE OUT SOME FOOLS OR SCREW WITH A SHIP LIKE HE DID IN LORDS OF THE SITH IT MAY BE MORE INTERESTING TO SEE HIM USE MORE FORCE ABILITY THAN A STRAIGHT UP LIGHTSABER DUEL
HE LOOKS SO LOVABLE
I LOVE THAT HE'S SO ACTIVE ON REDDIN AS WELL ALL ROUND GREAT GUY
HE LOOKS ABIT LIKE LARKIN
SHE'S CUTE PETER IS SEXY
BUT DO YOU STILL LOOK LIKE YOSHI
FOR THE MAN WHO IS TANGLED IN FORBIDDEN LOVE AND IS READY TO DO WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THINGS THE WAY HE WANTS THEM TO BE FIND POWER THAT SHOULD NOT BE UNDERESTIMATED
TOP NOTES OF PLASMA AND HITS OF PAEDOCIDE AND REDIRECTED DEVOTION ON A WARM VOLCANIC BASE
WARNING THIS SCENT MAY LEAD TO SUFFERING
DONT YOU LOVE THE SMELL OF REVENGE
SO THAT'S WHAT DARTH MAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE SAID HE WANTED TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO THE JEDI HE WAS REALLY JUST WANTING TO SHOW OFF HIS NEW COLOGNE
R TITLEGORE
PROBABLY SMELLS LIKE A TAUNTAUN
I BOUGHT VADER HAIR WAX THE OTHER DAY THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE BA DUM TSH SERIOUSLY THOUGH IT WAS ON SPECIAL
DOES IT SMELL LIKE BURNING FLESH AND FABRIC
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD MARKETING THINGS AS STAR WARS THAT A HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH STAR WARS AND B HAVE LITERALLY DIFFERENCE TO THE SAME PRODUCT WITHOUT STAR WARS BRANDING

I'VE SEEN THIS IN STUPID THINGS LIKE JELLY BEANS THEY ARE STAR WARS BECAUSE THE PACKAGE HAS CHARACTERS ON IT AND SO MANY OTHERS
I MAY HAVE GONE TOO FAR IN A FEW PLACES
NOT THE STAR WARS GRAPES AND ORANGES
HILARIOUSLY NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT LOVE THE TINY CAPE


SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
FANS WILL BUY ANYTHING
WHAT EMPIRE WHICH ERA IT LOOKS LIKE SITH TROOPS ARE FIGHTING AGAINST SOME RANDOM DROIDS AND CLEARLY OTHER SITH DOWNED STAR VESSEL IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE FROZEN WORLD DOESN'T RING ANY BELLS NOR REMINDS ME OF ANY HIGHLIGHT IN GALACTIC HISTORY WOULD YOU CARE TO ENLIGHTEN MY IGNORANT SOUL

OR PERHAPS THIS MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF ART IS AN EXAMPLE OF AUTHOR'S OWN OF THE UNIVERSE IN WHICH THE ACTION HAS BEEN SET AND THEREFORE NO WOOKIEPEDIA ARTICLE CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVENT

REGARDLESS AWESOME ART KEEP EM COCIN
BY ALEXEI EGOROV


SOURCE
AND THIS IS WHY I CREATED THE RULE OF 2 SOME PEOPLE JUST CANT HANDLE THEM SELVES DARTH BANE
IS THAT A AWA SITH LORD
THAT IS AWESOME
MORE LIKE RISE OF AN EMPIRE UNLESS THERE WAS AN EMPIRE OF DROIDS THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD OF
I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT AT SOME POINT WE GONNA SEE A MOMENT LIKE THIS IN A MOVIE IN THE FUTURE AND I'M ALREADY EXTREMELY EXCITED
FOAH IS THIS OFFICIAL

PEACE IS A LIE MAKES ME SUSPECT
HIGHER RESEARCH IS THIS OFFICIAL
AWESOME THE SITH CODE IS CANONIZED
PEACE IS A LIE THERE IS ONLY PASSION
THROUGH PASSION I GAIN STRENGTH
THROUGH STRENGTH I GAIN POWER
THROUGH POWER I GAIN VICTORY
THROUGH VICTORY MY CHAINS ARE BROKEN
THE FORCE SHALL FREE ME SORBUS SYN
I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN THIS IS JUST LOOK AT THE DEATH TROOPERS EACH ONE OF THEM ARE CROPPED FROM A DIFFERENT PHOTO FROM ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY NEVERTHELESS THIS IS AN AWESOME POSTER
THIS IS WHAT THE EMPIRE LOOKS LIKE GRAND SHOWS OF POWER AND MIGHT DARK COLORS OVERALL BADASSERY THIS MOVIE IS LOOKING BETTER AND BETTER
I JUST WANT A GRITTY DARK MOVIE WITH A FOCUS ON CLONES SHOW ME THE MASSIVE LOSS OF LIFE IN GALACTIC BATTLES AND HOW IT FEELS TO LOSE BROTHERS FOR A CIVILIZATION THAT DOESN'T SEE YOU AS MORE THAN A TOOL EXPLORE THE CLONES ARE THEY SPARTANS WHO VIEW DEATH IN COMBAT AS THE BEST GOAL OR ARE THEY LIKE THEIR CREATOR WHO JUST SEE IT AS A JOB AND WAY OF LIVING
HOW DARE THEY QUESTION THE PEACE AND ORDER BROUGHT BY THE EMPIRE IT SEEMS LIKE R EMPIREDIDNOTHINGWRONG IS THE ONLY RELIABLE SUB I CAN GO TO THESE DAYS
IS IT JUST ME OR IS THE DEATH STAR GETTING LARGER AND LARGER WITH EVERY TRAILER POSTER
WAR IS PEACE
PEACE CAKE
SITH MANTRA CANNON
DEFINITELY FAN MADE SAW IT AWHILE AGO AROUND THESE PARTS
THAT'S MANMADE
AND IF I RECALL I THINK IT WAS EVEN SOMEONE ON THIS SUBREDDIT THAT MADE IT
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE LINES FROM THE PREQUEL IS WHEN PALATINE PROCLAIMS PEACE
THERE IS ONLY PASSION
CAN SOMEONE PHOTOSHOP OUT THE PEACE IS A LIE PART
LOOKS PRETTY COOL BUT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO SYNC UP WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE SEEN SO FAR
PEACE IS A LIE

THAT'S FROM THE DARTH BANE NOVELS
IF THIS HAD A FEW OF THE MAIN CAST INSTEAD OF TROOPERS AND DIDN'T SAY PEACE IS A LIE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER THAN ANY OF THE OFFICIAL POSTERS
I COLLECTED ALL OF THOSE WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT

LONG GONE NOW


I HAD A LOT OF THOSE BACK IN THE DAY
WHAT FLAVOR IS THE GUM
MY FRIENDS AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS GAME A FEW WEEKS AGO AND COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING EARLIER THAN THIS I REMEMBER PLAYING THIS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND LOVED IT
OH MAN I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS IN FOREVER GOOD STUFF
JUST ANOTHER EAST TENSE WITH A BRA
CAUCASIAN COUSIN
LET ME PRACTICE MY STABBING HAHA
IT DOESN'T HELP THAT YOU COULD SEE TWO DIFFERENT MOUTHS ON IT
CLEARLY AN ITHORIAN IN A BIKINI
HELP US OUT HERE
OBVIOUSLY AN AUSTRALIAN STORM TROOPER
FOR THOSE WHO ARE STILL HAVING TROUBLE
STROMTOOPER

REMINDS ME OF ROBERTO FROM FUTURAMA
BLEEDING
BIKINI TROOPER
AND EVA HAD AN UGLY CHILD
IT LOOKS LIKE AN UPSIDE DOWN STORM TROOPER KIND OF
ABBA RIGHT
YODATROOPE TENSE
I THOUGH IT WAS A CAMPA AT FIRST
SID THE STORM TROOPER
IT'S OBVIOUSLY KILLFACE
WIKI FILE SESKIN OASIS
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN THIS IF THIS WASN'T ON R STARWARD
A JIGGLYPUTF SEEN FROM ABOVE
IT'S BROTHER GROUS
TWO TUBES YOU'LL RECOGNIZE HIM MORE AFTER ROGUE ONE COMES OUT
YEAH I LOOKED AT THAT PHOTO FOR MINUTES RACKING MY BRAIN BEFORE I FIGURED IT OUT
WHITE ET WEARING A BLACK BRA AND EATING GREY SPAGHETTI
WHY NOT HAVE LARS MIKKELSEN PLAY HIM
HONESTLY I DON'T THINK WE'LL SEE AND I DON'T REALLY WANT A LIVE ACTION THRAWN
CUMBERBATCH
READ CATALYST AND LARKIN PROBABLY IN THAT ORDER CATALYST WAS SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN AS A LEAD-IN TO ROGUE ONE
WELL CATALYST FOR ONE IT WAS JUST RELEASED AND IS A DIRECT SET UP FOR THE CHARACTERS AND STORY LINE OF THE MOVIE

IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT LARKIN THEN READ THE BOOK ABOUT HIM LARKIN I AM IT NOW AND THERE IS SOME RELEVANCE TO THE STORY OF THE DEATH STAR IT DOESN'T CONNECT TO ANY OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS OF ROGUE ONE AS IT IS MOSTLY ABOUT RELATIONSHIP TO VADER AND THE EMPEROR AND ALSO HIS ORIGIN STORY HOWEVER IT DOES ALSO GO INTO MOTIVATIONS ABOUT THE DEATH STAR PROJECT BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT AND IN THAT WAY IT HAS SOME RELEVANCE TO HIS RELATIONSHIP TO CRENIC IN BOTH CATALYST AND IN ROGUE ONE IT IS MAINLY JUST BEHIND THE SCENES TYPE OF STORY

I HAVE READ ALL OF THE NEW CANON BOOKS AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO THAT I FEEL LIKE HAVE RELEVANT CONNECTIONS TO THE EVENTS IN THE MOVIE
CATALYST IS GREAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
IIE Q ROGUE ONE BOOKS
DARTH VADER AFTER MUSTAFAR HAD A SEVERELY REDUCED POTENTIAL BUT HE DID GROW SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER DESPITE THAT HE WAS AROUND OF POWER BY THE TIME HE DIED

AS FOR CLONE WARS ANAKIN VS LUKE OR DARTH PLAGUERS WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF JUST HOW POWERFUL LUKE AND PLAGUERS ARE BUT ANAKIN WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL JEDI OF HIS ERA

AS FAR AS WE KNOW PALATINE WAS THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE USER OF HIS TIME WITH PERHAPS THE EXCEPTION OF THE ONES ON MORTIS
CANONICALLY SPEAKING ANAKIN WAS RECKONED TO BE TWICE AS POWERFUL AS PALATINE AFTER HIS INJURIES AND TRANSFORMATION IT WAS SAID HE WAS THEN SEVERELY DIMINISHED IN HIS FORCE POWERS ONLY AS POWERFUL AS PALATINE HARD TO KNOW ABOUT LUKE HE WAS STILL VERY MUCH COMING INTO HIS POWER DURING RETURN OF THE JEDI AND WE'VE YET TO SEE WHERE HE WENT FROM THERE BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW I WOULD SAY ANAKIN WAS TRULY FAFFY THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE BEING BUT LACKED THE MATURITY AND GENERAL TEMPERAMENT TO MAKE THE MOST OF HIS POWER
ALOT OF PEOPLE ARE THROWING OUT THE POWER OF PALATINE THING THAT HAS BEEN LATCHED ONTO OVER THE YEARS THIS WAS A STATEMENT MADE BY GEORGE LUCAS YEARS AGO WHETHER THIS IS LITERAL AND ACCURATE OR UP TO DATE IS HIGHLY DEBATABLE LUCAS HAS SAID SO MANY THINGS OUTSIDE OF CANON THAT HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS AND NEW CANON SHOWS VADER TO BE A DIFFERENT BEAST
VADER GREW MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN ANAKIN EVER WAS AND BY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN NEW CANON AND HOW HE STACKS AGAINST THE EMPEROR HE MAY BE EVEN MORE THAN AS POWERFUL AS PALATINE WHATEVER EDGE PALATINE HAS IN FORCE MASTERY AND POWER VADER DOES MAKE UP FOR IN PHYSICALITY AND COMBAT ABILITY
WE HAVE NEXT TO NO INFORMATION ON PLAGUERS OR PRIME LUKE SO THIS QUESTION IS A REALLY TOUGH ONE TO ANSWER
IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT LUKE REACHED THE POTENTIAL THAT ANAKIN COULD NOT WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM FAR AND AWAY THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE USER EVER

ULTRASABERS IS PROBABLY THE FASTEST YOU WILL FIND SABERFORGE HAS SOME HILTS ON BETSY THAT MAY SHIP FASTER BUT HAVE FEWER OPTIONS OR THEIR SITE THAT USUALLY SHIPS IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS EVERYTHING ELSE DIRECTLY FROM A BUSINESS WILL TAKE MONTHS YOU MAY TRY CHECKING FB FOR PEOPLE SELLING THEIR HILTS IF YOU WANT A HIGHER QUALITY ONE FASTER THE VAULT IS ONE GROUP THAT MAY HAVE SOME AS WELL AS LIGHTSABER EXCHANGE AND MAYBE THE CUSTOM LIGHTSABER OWNERS GROUP
THE CONSENSUS ON R LIGHTSABERS

ULTRASABERS ARE BULKY THEY FEEL LIKE GLORIFIED FLASHLIGHTS
SABERFORGE IS RUN BY A DICK
VAULT IS AMAZING IF YOU CAN PUT UP WITH THE EVER-INCREASING WAIT TIMES

ANY OTHER SABERSMITHS CHECK INDIVIDUALLY
HASBRO MASTER REPLICAS FORCEFUL LIGHTSABERS ARE REALLY GOOD TOO IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON DOING DUELING THEY'RE HIGH QUALITY WITH METAL HILTS
I CAN SECOND ULTRASABERS IF YOU ORDER A HILT THAT IS IN STOCK THEY CAN USUALLY ARRIVE AS FAST AS TWO WEEKS NOTE THIS ESTIMATE IS FROM MY PREVIOUS PURCHASES SO YOUR MILAGE MAY VARY IT MIGHT BE SLOWER DUE TO ROGUE ONE HYPE BUT I'D SAY ULTRASABERS IS STILL FASTER THAN OTHER SABER SMITHS
QUOTED CURRENTLY IN NEW CANON COLOUR OF A LIGHTSABER IS DETERMINED BY STATE OF A PERSON THAT CONSTRUCT IT BLUE FOR THOSE WHO TEND TO PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE FORCE AND GREEN TO WHOSE WHO FIND SPIRITUAL ASPECT OF FORCE IMPORTANT

THIS IS STILL NOT CANON ACCORDING TO PABLO THAT THE COLORS AREN'T OBVIOUS AND IT'S ENTIRELY MYSTIC MACES COLOR IS PURPLE JUST BECAUSE IT'S PURPLE DON'T READ INTO IT

WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE CRYSTAL CHOOSES IT'S COLOR OR ANYTHING

ALL WE KNOW IS THE PROCESS

AT THE GATHERING OR WHEREVER
THE CRYSTAL CALLS TO THE JEDI WHEN THE JEDI RETRIEVES AND THE CRYSTAL BONDS WITH THE JEDI IT IT BECOMES A COLOR CRYSTAL DO NOT CAL TO DARKSIDERS

ANYONE ONE CAN USE ANY SABER A SITH CAN PICK UP A RANDOM SABER AND USE IT AND IT WON'T CHANGE COLOR

THE BLADE CHANGES TO RED WHEN THE BOND IS FORCED BY A DARKSIDER

AHSOKAS BLADES ARE WHITE EITHER BECAUSE SHE CLEANSED THEM OR SHE CLEANSED THEM AND THAT'S THE COLOR THEY CHOSE

THIS THREAD IN STAR WARS CANON SUBREDDIT IS A GREAT SOURCE OF INFO

R STARWARSCANON COMMENTS


THERE IS A LOT OF CANON INFO ON GYBER CRYSTALS IN THE NEW NOVEL CATALYST BY JAMES LUCENT
IT TALKS IN DEPTH ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE GYBER CRYSTAL AND IT'S ATTUNEMENT TO THE FORCE AND HOW THE JEDI USE THEM ITS A GOOD READ
IT'S KIND OF IMPLIED IN THE ASOKA NOVEL S THAT BLADES ARE WHITE BECAUSE SHE HEALED AN RED CRYSTALS AFTER SHE DEFEATED HIM AND TOOK THEM FOR HER OWN LIGHTSABERS
WEREN'T BOTH THE TWINS IN THE VADER COMICS NOT FORCE ATTUNED I JUST ASSUMED THEIR LIGHTSABERS WERE COMPLETELY SYNTHETIC
WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THIS IS TRY NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH CHLO IN THE VADER COMIC TIS A SILLY PLACE
AND BASICALLY SABER SHOULD HAVE TURNED RED DURING THE RAID OF THE JEDI TEMPLE
THE OFFICIAL REASON WAS SCHEDULING CONFLICTS WHICH IS HOLLYWOOD CODE FOR I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT GIACCHINO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHY
DISPLAT SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME
RESHOOTS
YEAH IT'D BE NEW AND REFRESHING AND THERE CAN STILL BE STAR DESTROYERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN OR STICKING OUT OF ISLANDS
I THINK THAT CONCEPT ART LOOKS COOL BUT I LIKE THE STARK SHIFT FROM A DRY DESERT PLANET AT THE BEGINNING TO A LUSH WATER PLANET AT THE END
SHE'S LITERALLY ON AN ALMOST ALL WATER PLANET RIGHT NOW IN THE STORY AND WILL BE THERE IN EPISODE
ANYTHING BESIDES ANOTHER DESERT PLANET WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
FORCE SENSITIVE BEINGS FLOURISH ON A PLANET THAT EITHER TEEM WITH LIFE DAGOBA OR ONE THAT IS NEARLY DEVOID OF IT TATTOOING AND ZAKKEU
ANYTHING THAN NOTTATOOINE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN UP THE PARALLELS WITH ANH WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE BUT I THINK ZAKKEU WORKED FINE AS A DESERT WORLD PEOPLE WOULD HAVE JUST COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS A RIP OFF OF AMINO ANYWAY AND A WATER WORLD STILL ISN'T REALLY SOMETHING NEW
THAT LOOKS INCREDIBLY COOL AND ORIGINAL BUT OF COURSE J J WAS ON MEMBER BERRIES WHILE MAKING THE FILM SO INSTEAD WE GOT TATTOOING AND LUKE
I WOULD HAVE LIKED IF ZAKKEU WAS A PLANET OF CONSTANT AND NONSTOP SANDSTORMS
THIS ACTUALLY HYPED ME UP BIG TIME
AMERICAN LEADS BUT FILMED IN BRITAIN SO EVERYONE ELSE WAS LOCAL
WHERE THEY COME FROM IT SEEMS THAT THE OFFICERS HAVE THAT SNOBBY RICH KID ATTITUDE THEY GREW UP IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF CORUSCANT OR THE RICHEST PLACES OF CERELLIA OR CARIDA OR ERIDU ETC THE BRITISH ACCENT MAKES PEOPLE SOUND MORE EDUCATED IN THAT ROLE

THE AMERICAN ACCENT IS LIKE A WESTERN COWBOY LIKE FEEL THEY COME FROM BACKWATER PLANETS THAT ARE BEING OPPRESSED BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO THE STORM-TROOPER THEY ALSO HAVE AMERICAN LIKE ACCENTS
IT'S AN OLD HOLLYWOOD CONVENTION DATING BACK TO THE BIBLICAL EPICS OF THE JESUS AND HIS BUDDIES ALWAYS HAD AMERICAN ACCENTS SO THEY WOULD SEEM FAMILIAR TO US AUDIENCES AND THEREFORE BE AUTOMATICALLY ACCEPTED AS THE GOOD GUYS WHILE THE ROMANS ALWAYS HAD ENGLISH ACCENTS TO MARK THEM AS THE BAD GUYS
ALL THE STORM-TROOPER HAD AMERICAN ACCENTS
IT'S TV TROPE CALLED EVIL BRITAIN THEIR VOICES SOUND AMAZING FOR VILLAINS AND BAD GUYS

WATCH V



WATCH V AGAS
BECAUSE REASONS THAT'S WHY
ALL BRITS ARE INTERGALACTIC SPACE NAZIS
I ALWAYS REMEMBER THE ONE REBEL PILOT WITH A SOUTHERN DRAWL IN THE ROLL CALL SCENE AS THEY APPROACH THE DEATH STAR
ALSO ONE OF THE GANGSTERS WHO CHASES HAN IN FFA HAD A THICK SCOTTISH ACCENT
I LOVE WATCHING THE UNCUT FOOTAGE WITH DAVID BROWSES VOICE AS VADER HE SOUNDS LIKE SHREK WITH HIS ANGRY SCOTTISH BROGUE
THEY'RE NOT BAD BUT THE BS SERIES HELMET IS SMALLER THAN THE SCREEN USED ONES
I'VE ALWAYS CALLED DAY 2 REVENGE OF THE FIFTH
HAS SOMEONE FINALLY MADE AN EMULATOR WITH BTL WORKING
THIS GAME HAS AGED RATHER WELL IF I MANAGED TO FIND MY ORIGINAL DISCS I'D PLAY IT IN A HEARTBEAT
IF MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY LUKE WAS USING THE FORCE IN THE TRENCH RUN WHICH WAS WHY VADER COULD SENSE IT LEIA HAS NEVER USED THE FORCE IN HIS PRESENCE
I THINK OF IT LIKE A SUBMARINE YOU HAVE TO BE MAKING NOISE FOR SOMEONE TO DETECT YOU LUKE WAS PINGING AWAY WITH ACTIVE SONAR WHILE TRYING TO DESTROY THE DEATH STAR BUT AS FAR AS WE KNOW LEIA DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONSCIOUSLY CALL ON THE FORCE NO PING NO RETURN
AT THAT POINT LUKE HAD ADMIRABLY MINIMAL TRAINING IN THE WAYS OF THE FORCE SO VADER WAS ABLE TO SENSE HIS CONNECTION THAT WAS BEGINNING TO FORM LEIA HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY TRAINING SO HER FORCE ABILITIES WEREN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO SENSE
LEIA WASN'T INTENDED TO BE A FORCE SENSITIVE DURING ANH SHE WASN'T ACTUALLY PLANNED TO BE SISTER EVEN BY THE END OF ESB
MAYBE LEIA HAS A BUCKY CONNECTION TO THE FORCE TAKING AFTER HER MOTHER DIDN'T HELP THAT SHE RECEIVED NO TRAINING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TRILOGY SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY DEMONSTRABLE POWERS SO FAR EVEN IN EPISODE OTHER THAN HER CAPACITY TO SENSE LOVED ONES HAN
BECAUSE LUKE WAS ACTIVELY USING THE FORCE LEIA WAS NOT
THIS IS A REALLY COOL AND GOOD HEADCANON
THAT WOULD BE PRETTY AWESOME NOT GONNA LIE ESPECIALLY SINCE RAKATA PRIME IS STILL CANON
THAT'S A PRETTY COOL THOUGHT HOPEFULLY THEY GO INTO MORE DETAIL IN NOVELS IN THE FUTURE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SECTION OF A GALAXY WHICH WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SPACE I HAVE A HARD TIME IMAGINING THE FORCE COULD HAVE AN IMPACT SO FAR AND WIDE AS THE RESULT OF COLLECTIVES


THE COMMON EXPLANATION IS THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE INNER CORE SYSTEMS WHERE THE JEDI AND SITH ORIGINATED IS JUST OLD AND UNRELIABLE HYPERSPACE LANES HAVE COLLAPSED OR BECOME TOO UNSTABLE OVER THE MILLENNIA THIS WAS BACKED UP IN VII FFA
WHAT HAPPENED ON MORTIS WAS JUST A FORCE VISION SHARED BY OUR HEROES OTHER THAN THAT INTERESTING OBSERVATION WE'LL SEE WHETHER THEY'LL PULL THIS THREAD
IT'S DARK EMPIRE ALL OVER AGAIN
ANY CHANCE IT SHARES ANY SIMILARITIES WITH THE OLD STAR WARS REBELLION FOR THE COMPUTER

SOON TO BE CANON
EDIT S
GODDAMN THIS GAME IS BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT BUT I STILL HAVEN'T WRAPPED MY HEAD AROUND THE RULES PROPERLY
DO NOT WANT
MY GROUP PLAYED THIS YESTERDAY I FEEL BAD I'VE PLAYED BOTH SIDES TWICE AND HAVE A REALLY REALLY GOOD FEEL FOR WHAT BOTH SIDES DO WE JUST GOT THE BOBA FETT ACTION CARD AND LURE OF THE DARK SIDE I WAS JUST WAITING FOR THEM TO SEND LUKE TO FIND YODA THEY DID IT WE CAPTURED HIM PLAYED THE BOBA FETT CARD SO NO ONE INTERFERES WITH THE PROCESS EASY TURN YODA JUST HAD TO SIT THERE ON DAGOBA IN HORROR AS THE EMPEROR BEAT HIM AGAIN


GOOD GOOD SMILES MENACINGLY
THE LAST TIME I PLAYED CHEWIE WAS TURNED TO THE DARK SIDE AND WENT ON TO FREEZE HAN IN CARBONITE I DIDN'T DO SO WELL AFTER THAT
I WISH I HAD FRIENDS
WELL DONE DID YOU SEND GENERAL RIEKA TO OPPOSE DICE LOSING TO DICE IS TOUGH LUCK BUT IT HAPPENS


IT IS COOL THAT THE GAME CAN HAVE MOMENTS LIKE THIS OR LIKE WHEN THE REBEL OBJECTIVE CARDS LET'S LUKE KILL AN ENEMY LEADER
PLAYED THIS THE OTHER WEEK 2 V ME AND MY GENERAL EMPIRE CONCOCTED A BRILLIANT PLAN WHICH WOULD MAKE USE OF THE FORCE THEM TO TELL YOU THREE PLANETS BASE MUST BE ONE OF THEM AND MAKE OPPONENT UNABLE TO CONTEST CARDS
BASTARD USED HIS MOVE BASE CARD STRAIGHT AFTER I NEARLY TABLE FLIPPED
I'D SIGN ON FOR THAT
ONLY ONE THAT WOULD WORK WOULD BE THE SIEGE OF BANDALORE

THE BAD BATCH ON KASHYYYK ONE WAS MORE OF SPIRITUAL AND DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW ARC

THE REST WAS EITHER RELEASED IN SOME WAY ALREADY OR WASN'T ABOUT FIGHTING
I REALLY HOPE THERE ARE CLONE WARS BATTLES IN THE NEXT BATTLEFRONT I REALLY WANT TO SEE PHOTOREALISTIC CLONES AND DROIDS IN GAME AND USE ALL THE VEHICLES FROM THAT ERA CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT A MODERN FELECIA MAP WOULD LOOK LIKE
BECAUSE THE CLONE WARS WERE SO WIDESPREAD AND HAD SO MANY HEROES FROM CLONE OFFICERS TO JEDI I THINK BATTLEFIELD S WAR STORIES CAMPAIGN WOULD BE A GOOD TEMPLATE FOR A STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT CLONE WARS CAMPAIGN EACH MISSION WOULD BE ITS OWN SELF-CONTAINED SHORT STORY CENTERED AROUND THE SAME CONFLICT THIS WAY WE GET TO SEE MORE THAN WHAT A STANDARD LINEAR CAMPAIGN WOULD OFFER

I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF WE ARE TO GET A EA DICE CLONE WARS BATTLEFRONT IT'LL BE A SPINOFF OF THE NEW SERIES OF GAMES LIKE BATTLEFIELD HARDLINE WAS FOR THE BATTLEFIELD FRANCHISE
YES
THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD IDEA HAVE A CAMPAIGN LEADING TO THE RESCUE MISSION FOR THE CHANCELLOR WHICH I THINK IS WHAT THE CLONE WARS WAS SUPPOSED TO END AT
SO MUCH JEDI ACTION THOUGH THEY'D NEED TO MAKE THE MELEE MORE LIKE DARK SOULS OR WITCHER OR SOMETHING TO BE ENJOYABLE HERO CONTROLS ARE ATROCIOUS IN THESE GAMES
AS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT A HUGE GAMER I WOULDN'T REALLY LIKE THIS IDEA I WOULD PREFER THAT THEY RELEASE THEM IN COMIC OR BOOK FORM OR MAYBE EVEN AN ANIMATED MOVIE ON THE SIEGE OF BANDALORE I'M ALSO STILL HOLDING OUT HOPE THAT THEY WILL FINISH THE SHOW ONE DAY AS UNLIKELY AS IT SEEMS BUT MAYBE WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED WITH THEIR MAIN PLANS OF FILMS AND OTHER TV SHOWS THEY CAN GO BACK AND COMPLETE THE REST OF ACW AND RELEASE THEM ON NETFLIX OR SOMETHING WISHFUL THINKING I KNOW
I WOULD BE HAPPY JUST SIMPLY HAVING CLONE WARS AS AN OPTION THERE'S A REASON THE FIRST FEW BATTLEFRONT GAMES FOCUSED SO HEAVILY ON THEM
WHILE I WAS ALREADY HOPING FOR CLONE WARS ERA BATTLES IN I HADN'T ACTUALLY REALISED HOW MUCH I WANTED TO SEE ACW CONNECTIONS IN GAME

I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW AWESOME A REALISTICALLY MODELLED REX OR ASOKA HERO CHARACTER WOULD BE IN FACT I THINK YOU'D ALMOST HAVE TO REWORK THE MECHANIC TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENT BALANCE IN FORCES PRESENT IN THE CLONE WARS THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY A LOT MORE JEDI RUNNING AROUND TAKING PERSONAL COMMAND OF THE CLONE FORCES SO MAYBE CLONE WARS HEROES COULD BE INDIVIDUALLY WEAKER BUT MORE NUMEROUS ESPECIALLY IF YOU ALSO THROUGH IN ALL THE CLONE COMMANDERS LIKE CODY AND GREE

THE SCOPE FOR CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION IS ALSO WAY BIGGER THAN THE OT UNLOCKABLE UNIT COLOUR SCHEMES WOULD BE AWESOME
I'D LIKE THAT IDEA HOWEVER SOME OF THOSE EPISODES WHICH I WATCHED WEREN'T THAT GREAT ECHO WAS BROUGHT BACK FROM THE DEAD BUT HE WAS KIND OF LAME I'D RATHER SEE THE STORY ARC OF REX GETTING HIS CHIP REMOVED AND THE EXPLANATION FOR HIS ABSENCE IN REVENGE OF THE SITH I'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE THE RISE OF ALPO BLY BEYO GREE AND ACARA THE RETURN OF GREGOR WOULD BE COOL AS WELL AS DEPARTURE AND REMOVAL OF HIS CHIP
I'D HONESTLY RATHER THEY DIDN'T

THE BEST DICE HAS EVER DONE WITH A CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN PRETTY GOOD FOLLOWED BY OK AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS DOWNHILL FROM THERE

I'D RATHER THEY JUST MAKE A FULLY COMPLETE MULTIPLAYER TITLE AND LET A STUDIO THAT KNOWS WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE DOING HANDLE A NARRATIVE
HAN SOLO WOULD BE IN SLYTHERIN

SEARCH YOUR FEELINGS YOU KNOW IT TO BE TRUE
WHY DID YOU PUT LEIA IN HUFFLEPUFF
PRINCE PIZOR SLYTHERIN
I'D PUT LUKE AND REY IN HUFFLEPUFF LEIA IN GRYFFINDOR HAN AND IN SLYTHERIN WITH VADER KALO IN RAVENCLAW
I'D REORGANIZE IT A LITTLE

GRYFFINDOR LUKE HAN AND POE

HUFFLEPUFF CHEWBACCA FINN AND REY

RAVENCLAW LEIA YODA AND

SLYTHERIN VADER AND KALO

I THINK VADER WOULD BE A GRYFFINDOR AFTER ALL HE WAS ONCE A JEDI

DUMBLEDORE WAS A GRYFFINDOR AND HE WAS LEAD DOWN A DARK PATH AS A YOUNG MANUAL IT COULD HAPPEN
DELETED
I WOULD ASSUME EVERYONE SUBSCRIBED TO THIS SUBREDDIT THAT LIVES IN THE US WILL BE DOING THE SAME

I MEAN I AM I'VE BEEN ON PINS AND NEEDLES FOR THESE TICKETS TO BLAST MY WALLET AND THE ANTICIPATION HAS BEEN TERRIBLE TONIGHT WILL BE A HUGE RELIEF ONCE THEY ARE IN HAND

CAN YOU SEE OUT OF THAT THING

OH AND YOU ARE A LITTLE SHORT FOR A STORM-TROOPER
THINK YOU'RE COOL HOLDING YOUR BLASTER LIKE SOME KINDA REBEL STICK TO YOUR TRAINING TROOPER I DON'T CARE IF YOU CAN'T HIT A SINGLE TARGET THAT WAY
ARE THEY GOING TO ALLOW US TO WEAR HELMETS INSIDE THE THEATER THIS TIME I CAN UNDERSTAND NOT LETTING US BRING BLASTERS BUT I REALLY HOPE THEY DON'T STOP US AT THE DOOR AND SAY NO HELMETS
HOW COMFY IS IT SITTING IN THE THEATER IN FULL COSTUME
WHY AREN'T YOU AT YOUR POST
HEADS UP MANY THEATERS DON'T ALLOW HELMETS MANY ALSO DON'T ALLOW YOU TO BRING THEM IN CAUSE THEY KNOW YOU'LL JUST PUT THEM ON IF YOU WAIT IN LINE FOR THAT GREAT SEAT YOU WANT IT WILL SUCK HARD TO GO PUT YOUR HELMET UP AND LOSE THAT PERFECT SEAT
I'LL BE A LITTLE BIT BUMMED IF THEY AREN'T ALL GODDAMNED DEAD

NOT ONLY WOULD IT MAKE THEIR SACRIFICE MORE INTERESTING IF THEY ALL GET DIE BUT IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY NONE OF THESE HEROES OF THE REBELLION EVER SHOWED UP AGAIN ANYWHERE IN THE OT FILMS AND WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN WHY THE ROGUE NAME BECAME A TRIBUTE WITHIN THE REBELLION
AGREE WITH MOST BUT HERE'S MY THOUGHTS ON IT I THINK ORGANA IS SAFE FOR ONE BIG REASON AND THAT'S EMOTIONAL IMPACT YES IT'S EMOTIONAL SEEING ALDERMAN BLOWING UP AND SEEING REACTION HOWEVER IT WOULDN'T BE QUITE THE SAME IF WE KNEW ORGANA WAS ALREADY DECEASED NOT ONLY DID LEIA LOSE HER PLANET HER FRIENDS AND CITIZENS BUT SHE ALSO LOST HER FATHER I THINK ROOK IS DONE FOR ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT THIRD TRAILER WHERE IT MENTIONS THAT WE WILL DO IT NO MATTER THE COST BUTCHERED THAT I KNOW AND IT SHOWS HIM BEHIND A CRATE OR SOMETHING LOOKING CONFLICTED AND THEN RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE KRENNIC I AM CONFLICTED ON HE'S OBVIOUSLY HIGH HIGH UP HE'S NOT MENTIONED IN LARKIN AND HE'S NOT MENTIONED EVER AGAIN HE DONE SOMETHING GRAVE WE SEE HIM MONOLOGIAN ABOUT THE DEATH STAR TO VADER WE LOVES THAT AND LATER LOOKING SCARED AS VADER MOVES IN AT BADASS PACE HE WON'T MAKE IT STORY WILL FINALLY BE COMPLETE AND HE WILL BITE THE BULLET I BELIEVE I THINK K2 IS SAFE I THINK DEATH WILL BE THE THING THAT BRINGS THE TEAM TOGETHER JUST MY RAMBLINGS
WHY WOULD BAIL ORGANA HAVE SUCH A HIGH RATE OF DYING IN THIS FILM I THINK LEIA WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE DEATH OF HER FATHER PRETTY QUICKLY AND SHE SEEMED QUITE CHIPPER WHEN TALKING TO VADER PRIOR TO THE DEATH STAR

THOUGH SHE DOES SEEM TO GET OVER ALDERMAN PRETTY QUICK
DYING BUT NOT BY THE REBELS I THINK GONNA CHOKE HIM THE FUCK OUT
AGREE WITH MOST OF THIS BUT I'D MOVE UP CASSIAN HE'S QUITE HIGH UP IN THE ALLIANCE YET WE NEVER SEE OR HEAR FROM HIM AGAIN AND IF HE GOES I THINK K2 GOES TOO

I GO BACK AND FORTH ON AYN SHE COULD DIE BUT I THINK THEY WILL WANT TO HAVE AT LEAST SOMEONE MAKE IT AND SHE HAS THE BEST SPINOFF POTENTIAL
I PREFER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN WHAT IS FINAL KILL TALLY BY THE END OF THE FILM
WAIT PERKINS IS IN ROGUE ONE

I'M MORE HYPED THAN EVER
SAW GERAERA

NAH HE MIGHT NOT END UP DEAD
I'M GONNA SAY IT AGAIN AND I KNOW I'LL GET HATE AGAIN FOR IT NO WAY THEY KILL AYN BAD PR MOVE FOR DISNEY
JUST FINISHED WRITING MY SCRIPT TO REFRESH THE SHOWING I WANT ONCE YOU CAN SELECT TICKETS IT WILL SELECT THE NUMBER OF TICKETS GO TO SEAT SELECTION SEARCH FOR THE BEST SEATS IN THE MIDDLE OF MY DESIGNATED ROWS THEN PROCEED TO THE CHECKOUT PAGE AND WAIT FOR ME TO FILL IN MY INFORMATION IT TAKES IT ABOUT A QUARTER OF A SECOND TO CHOOSE SEATS TESTING IT

I EXPECT IT TO FAIL MISERABLY WHEN THE TICKETS GO ON SALE THOUGH LOL

EDIT MANAGED TO GET MY SEATS JUST BEFORE THEY WENT TO THE QUEUE PHEW TOOK ABOUT MINUTES OF REFRESHING BEFORE THE PAGE FINALLY LOADED
RIGHT WITH YOU BUDDY I'M ROUNDING UP MY LIST OF WHO IS GOING WITH ME AS WE SPEAK

I MEAN THE THEATER WE'RE GOING TO WILL BE PRETTY OPEN BUT STILL STAR WARS IS MY VERSION OF RELIGION
I HAVE TWO IPADS A LAPTOP AND MY PHONE ALL WITH DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS OPEN ONE OF THEM IS BOUND TO WORK
SQUAD IS ARMED AND READY WITH DEVICES
TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER I SHOULD SEE THE MOVIE AT EL CAPITAN THEATER OR AT THE CHINESE THEATER IN IMAX ALSO IF AT THE IMAX WOULD PM ON THURSDAY BE THE BEST SHOWING TO ATTEND THIS WOULD BE MY FIRST STAR WARS PREMIERE IN LA AND WANT TO GET THE BEST OF IT
THE HUSBAND AND I FREQUENT THE LOCAL CINEMARK A LOT AND HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW SEVERAL OF THE USHERS THERE TONIGHT ON THE WAY OUT ONE OF THEM SAID HEY REMEMBER PM TONIGHT ASIDE WE'RE CST HUSBAND AND I BOTH GAVE A THUMBS UP AND I SHOUTED SAVE THE REBELLION NERD MOMENTS
YEAH MY THEATER TOLD ME THAT THEY DON'T START SELLING THEM UNTIL THE SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT TO DO THERE HAHA CHANCE IT AND WAIT OR JUST GO TO A MAJOR THEATER SITE THAT'LL LIKELY CRASH AND KEEP ME LOCKED OUT FOR A WHILE

EDIT ENDED UP GOING TO ANOTHER AND GOT PRETTY GOOD IMAX SEATS IT WORKED OUT
MULTIPLE WINDOWS AND APPS WILL BE OPEN I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE AS BAD AS FFA WAS BUT I ALSO WASN'T SO WORRIED ABOUT GETTING AN OPENING SHOW SLOT FOR THAT ONE EITHER
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY TIPS FOR GETTING TICKETS OFF FANDANGO THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TRYING TO GET TICKETS FOR AN OPENING NIGHT SCREENING JUST WORRIED THEY ARE GONNA SELL OUT BEFORE I CAN GET MY TICKETS
FANDANGO AND CINEMARK KEPT FREEZING ON ALL MY DEVICES TOOK MINUTES TO GET THROUGH AND BY THAT TIME THE EXACT SEATS I WANTED WERE TAKEN BUT STILL GOT DECENT SEATS JUST DISAPPOINTING THAT THIS HAPPENS EVERY YEAR
MINS
AND FANDANGO IS DOWN
SHOULD I EVEN BOTHER FOR A SINGLE TICKET IN STANDARD VIEWING TONIGHT OR WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING I REALIZED MY PRINTER DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY INK LEFT EITHER SHIT
FOR SOME REASON I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE DOING THIS TOMORROW NIGHT THANK YOU
EH I'LL JUST WAIT TILL I SEE THE MOVIE TO BUY TICKETS LAST YEAR FOR FFA I BOUGHT MY TICKETS AT THE BOX OFFICE THE NIGHT I SAW IT AND EVERYTHING WORKED OUT PERFECTLY
TICKETS ARE ON SALE NOW
DID YOU NOT WATCH THE MOVIE HUGGING KALO REN IS A VERY BAD IDEA
THE JOKER IN BATMAN MARKHAM CITY VOICED BY MARK HAMILL IS IN DIRE NEED OF A HUG JUST SAYING

MARKHAM CITY SPOILERS S BATMAN LEARNS THAT THE UNSTABLE PROPERTIES OF THE TITAN FORMULA ARE MUTATING IN BLOOD GRADUALLY KILLING HIM


I NOMINATED BORDERLANDS 2 FOR THAT AWARD BUT I BET KALO WOULD ENJOY A GOOD HUG
I'D SAY DARTH MAUL POOR GUYS BEEN THROUGH A LOT
EDH I DON'T KNOW IF KALO OR SNOKE REALLY NEED A HUG I ALREADY NOMINATED SISTER LOCATION ANYWAYS
LOVE THE GAME BUT NUMBER ABSOLUTELY NOT
I AGREE ESPECIALLY WITH THE X WING SCENE YOU MENTIONED NOW THERE IS ZERO TENSION IN THAT SCENE

THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS AVOID TRAILERS AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE THESE TV SPOTS JUST SHOW TOO MUCH IN MY OPINION
SOMEWHAT YES THOUGH I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY BUGGED ME WAS THE DEATH STAR FIRING THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'LL BE A BIG MOMENT IN THE FILM AND WITH AS ICONIC AS THE DEATH STAR IS THAT SEEMED LIKE WAY TOO BIG A REVEAL
I FELT EXACTLY THE SAME ABOUT THE SCENE I REGRETTED WATCHING THAT TRAILER EVEN THOUGH IT'S A MINOR DETAIL IN APPEARANCE

IT ONLY REINFORCES HOW BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED THE EPISODE TRAILER WAS
YOU SAW THE TRAILER THOUGHT IT SHOWED TOO MUCH AND AS A RESULT WATCHED IT NINE MORE TIMES MAKES SENSE TO ME
IN THE BIBLE NAHUM THAT SEEMS LIKE A MINOR DETAIL TO ME IT'S ONLY BAD WHEN THEY REVEAL SOMETHING LIKE A MAJOR TWIST OR THE ENDING
I AGREE TO AN EXTENT BUT I KNEW THAT WAS A RISK WHEN I CHOSE TO WATCH THE TRAILERS I HAVE FRIENDS WHO'VE AVOIDED ALL TRAILERS AND INFO ABOUT THE MOVIE TO THIS POINT BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO GO SEE IT NO MATTER WHAT
FAFFY
DON'T WATCH THE TRAILERS ONLINE OR AT LEAST DON'T WATCH THEM MULTIPLE TIMES IF YOU WANT THE MOVIE GOING EXPERIENCE TO BE THE BEST YOU SHOULD TRY TO NOT WATCH EVERY SINGLE TRAILER AS THEY ARE RELEASED

TRAILERS ARE ONLY REVEALING IF YOU WATCH THEM
I FEEL LIKE STAR WARS IS USUALLY VERY GOOD AT NOT REVEALING PLOT IN THE TRAILERS I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO NOT SEE THE TAKE OUT THE BUT THAT'S A PRETTY SMALL PLOT POINT AT THE END OF THE DAY
DEFINITELY AGREE ABOUT THE MOMENT AS SOON AS I SAW IT IN THE TRAILER I WISHED I HADN'T SO FAR THAT HAS BEEN THE ONLY THING THAT WAS TOO REVEALING FOR ME IN THE TRAILERS THOUGH
I'M JUST GLAD THEY AREN'T REVEALING ANY CAMEOS
CAN'T KNOW UNTIL WE'VE SEEN THE FINAL CUT OF THE MOVIE
YEAH I DIDN'T READ YOUR POST OR ANY OF THESE COMMENTS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED I ONLY WATCHED THE FIRST TRAILER
I'VE MANAGED TO AVOID ALL THE TV TRAILERS AND I ONLY WATCHED THE LAST 3RD TRAILER ABOUT TIMES WHEN IT CAME OUT BECAUSE I FELT LAST YEAR I'D SPOILT FFA BY SEEKING OUT ALL THESE DAMN TRAILERS I MANAGED SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH ROTS AFTER I'D SPOILT ROTC FOR MYSELF BY FINDING AN ENTIRE SYNOPSIS OF THE PLOT MONTHS BEFORE IT CAME OUT
JUST CONTAIN YOURSELVES GUYS
AND IF YOU FUCK THIS ONE UP JUST WAIT TIL NEXT YEAR AND TRY AGAIN

SAME PERSON WHO HAS BEEN SUGGESTED PREVIOUSLY THEY NEED TO FIND THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB AND IF THAT HAPPENS TO BE A FEMALE THEN GREAT BUT DON'T MAKE THAT A CRITERIA WHEN LOOKING FOR A DIRECTOR
I'D BE SO DOWN FOR BIGELOW STAR WARS ZERO DARK THIRTY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES SHE'S A FANTASTIC DIRECTOR WHO TACKLES HER STORIES WITH SUCH RAW INTENSITY I THINK SHE'D BE A GREAT FIT FOR THE UNIVERSE
MICHELLE MACLAREN
SHE'S EXPERIENCED WON BEST DIRECTOR EVEN THOUGH HER MOVIE DIDN'T WIN BEST PICTURE THAT YEAR WHICH MAY EVEN BE A PRO THAT SHE STOOD OUT AS A DIRECTOR EVEN THOUGH HER MOVIE DIDN'T WIN OVERALL

HURT LOCKER WON BEST PICTURE AND BEST DIRECTOR AT THE ACADEMY AWARD CEREMONY
R STARWARSTATTOO
R NEVERTELLMETHEODDS
FUCKING GORGEOUS ALWAYS STRANGE TO ME HOW SIMPLE LINE TATS WHICH ARE STILL COOL GET SO POPULAR ON THIS SUB AND BEAUTIFUL TRADITIONAL ONES GET KINDA BURIED WHERE'D YOU GET THIS DONE
NO CHANCE THEY END IT WITHOUT SOME SEMBLANCE OF A HAPPY ENDING

IT SEEMS LIKE A REAL POSSIBILITY WITH THE NEW REPUBLIC BEING DESTROYED AND MOST OF THE FIRST ORDER MAKING IT OFF OF STARKVILLE

NOT EVEN SURE WHY THIS IS RELEVANT THE NEW REPUBLIC WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RESISTANCE ANYWAYS THAT'S WHY THE RESISTANCE WAS CREATED
ITS A BIT OF A MESS THE NEW REPUBLIC CENTRAL COMMAND WAS DESTROYED MANY OF THE RESISTANCE FIGHTERS AND STARKVILLE BASE WHICH SEEMED TO HOUSE A LOT OF THE FIRST ORDER TROOPS
I FIGURED IT WOULD A FAX TO PC AND LEIA WOULD BURN THE PLANS TO A MINI THEN DELETE THE EMAIL
IF MEMORY SERVES SOMEONE VADER SAYS THAT A TRANSMISSION WAS BEAMED TO THE BLOCKADE RUNNER

EDIT BEAMED CONFIRMED
I'M ASSUMING THEY'LL BE BEAMED OVER TO THE TACTIVE IV JUST BEFORE SHIP EXPLODES RAMS INTO SHIP ETC
VADER STATES IN ANH THAT REBELS TRANSMITTED THE PLANS TO THE TACTIVE IV
I REALLY HOPE IT ENDS WITH A SHOT OF TACTIVE IV CRUISING THROUGH SPACE
I HOPE IT ENDS WITH A SHOT OF CAPTAIN ANTILLES PRINCESS LEIA AND C ABOARD THE BRIDGE OF THE TACTIVE IV RECEIVING THE PLANS
SENT VIA ROWBOAT
A UNIVERSE THAT HAS DROIDS CLONES BIONIC REPLACEMENT LASER GUNS DEATH STARS HYPER DRIVES ANTI GRAVITY DEVICES BUT NO EMAIL
I THINK SHE'LL PHYSICALLY PUT THEM IN HAND AND THROUGH SOME MANNER OF CGI DUCKERY WE'LL SEE THE YOUNG CARRIE FISHER IN THE MOVIE'S FINAL MOMENTS
WHAT IS A FAVORITE CAR A TOYODA
WHY DO EPISODES COME BEFORE
BECAUSE IN CHARGE OF PLANNING YODA WAS
YODA MAN FUNNY GUY
EPISODE AND THE OTHER FILMS ARE GOING BACK TO MAY RELEASES I BELIEVE THOUGH
HI I BOUGHT TICKETS LAST NIGHT FROM THAT SAME THEATER UA KOP I BOUGHT TICKETS FOR THE PM SHOW DEC I WAS ALSO SHOCKED THAT THEY DIDN'T OFFER RESERVED SEATING IF YOU CHECK YOU WILL SEE THAT NO SHOWS ARE OFFERED WITH RESERVED SEATING UNTIL DEC IN THE IMAX THEATER THIS REALLY SUCKS BECAUSE RESERVED SEATING IS MADE FOR MOVIES LIKE ROGUE ONE I'M PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO GO HOURS BEFORE SHOWTIME TO GET GOOD SEATS NOW

BTW I'M NOT SURE THIS IS AN ERROR I HAVE A THEORY THAT REGAL LOST MONEY WITH RESERVED SEATING WHEN FFA CAME OUT LAST YEAR WITH RESERVED SEATING SOME SEATS WILL NEVER BE SOLD BECAUSE THE BUYERS WILL SEE HOW POOR THEY ARE THUS THEY PROBABLY GOT FEWER SELLOUTS IN THE FIRST WEEKS THEN THEY NORMALLY WOULD WITH OPEN SEATING EVERYONE THINKS THEY WILL GET GOOD SEATS WHEN THEY REALLY WON'T MORE SHOWS WILL SELL OUT INITIALLY WHEN THE LATE ARRIVERS SHOW UP AND CAN'T GET GOOD SEATS THEY WILL STILL PROBABLY STAY AND WATCH THE MOVIE BECAUSE THEY WILL BE OUT ANYWAY JUST A THEORY THOUGH
HELLO FELLOW PA PEOPLE I'VE NEVER SEEN RESERVED SEATING HERE DO THEY USUALLY DO IT I BOUGHT TICKETS FOR THE MOVIE TAVERN IN COLLEGEVILLE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE ALL OF THEIR ONLINE TICKET SALES OFFER RESERVED SEATS REGARDLESS OF THE MOVIE
I SAW FFA OPENING NIGHT AT THE FIRST SHOWING AT MY LOCAL THEATER ALTHOUGH IT IS A HUGE AND POPULAR THEATER THEY DID NOT OFFER ANY RESERVED SEATING UNTIL THIS YEAR

ANYWAY I SHOWED UP AT FOR THE SHOWING AND HAD NO PROBLEMS GETTING MIDDLE CENTER SEATS IMMOV BUT I WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU NEED TO BE IN LINE HOURS AND HOURS EARLY
WHEN I WAS IN THE STUDENT SECTION FROM THERE WAS A HALO SPARTAN DECKED OUT IN PENN STATE COLORS
THAT GIRL IN THE BACK IS DEEPING HARD
I LOVE WHEN MY TWO FAVORITE SUBREDDITS MEET
WHY CARRY OUT ORDER WHEN THERE'S FOOTBALL TO WATCH
VIRGINIA TECH HAD A COKIE TROOPER FOR A WHILE
THERE'S A GUY THAT CALLS HIMSELF THE IMPERIAL STORMCOUGAR

UHSTORMTROOPER
I HOPE SHE'S DEAD IN FACT I HOPE ALL OF THEM ARE SO THAT ITS TRUE WHEN YODA SAYS TO LUKE WHEN GONE AM I THE LAST OF THE JEDI WILL YOU BE

I'VE HAD ABOUT ENOUGH OF SECRETLY SURVIVING FORCE WIELDERS
HER CANONICAL DEATH WAS CONFIRMED AS BEING KILLED BY DARTH VADER DURING ORDER IN THE REFERENCE BOOK STAR WARS GALACTIC ATLAS
WOOKIEPEDIA
SHE IS OFFICIALLY DEAD SHE DIED DURING ORDER IN THE JEDI TEMPLE ME TOO I LOVE SHAAK TI BUT I THINK ITS BETTER THAT WAY THAT SHE DIED DURING ORDER
WITH PREVIOUS KILLING HER WITH A BLUE LIGHTSABER IN A DELETED SCENE FROM REVENGE OF THE SITH AND SHAAK TI BEING KILLED THE EXACT SAME WAY IN VISION IN THE CONE WARS I THINK WE CAN SAFELY ASSUME THAT SHE'S DEAD
NO SHE IS DEFINITELY DEAD EVEN THOUGH IT WAS IN A DELETED SCENE SHE IS DEAD
WASN'T SHE IN ONE OF THE VIDEO GAMES THE ONE WHERE EVADERS SECRET APPRENTICE HINTS HER DOWN ON A JUNGLE PLANET NEVER PLAYED IT JUST READ AN A GAME REVIEW AND SAW SOME PROPOSED ARTWORK
IN THE CLONE WARS TV SHOW ONE OF THE EPISODES INVOLVES YODA SEEING A VISION OF SHAAK TI BEING IMPALED FROM BEING BY A BLUE LIGHTSABER BASICALLY LIKE THE DELETED SCENE WHERE SHE IS KILLED BY VADER

SO YES SHE'S OFFICIALLY DEAD IN CANON
THESE VIDEOS WILL BE THE DEATH OF YOUTUBE SO MUCH GARBAGE NOWADAYS
I THINK THIS VIDEO SUMS UP ALL MY FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT STAR WARS
THAT DEPENDS WHAT DO YOU LIKE AND WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER UNIQUE
I HAVE A SHIRT WHICH FEATURES DARTH VADER WALKING AN ON A LEASH DOWN AN ALLEY I WOULD SAY THAT'S UNIQUE
I'M STILL TRYING TO FIND A PURCHASEABLE BOBA FETT ON MOTORCYCLE SHIRT ONE DAY
ONE OF THOSE MOJI SHIRTS DDK ABOUT STAR WARS STUFF THOUGH
ON THAT NOTE YOU ALL READY FOR SOME MORE STAR WARS
WHAT REDDIN DRAMA
MY GOD PEOPLE ITS A FANTASTIC TIME TO BE ALIVE AS A STAR WARS FAN
YOU IMPERIAL BASTARD
DRAMA
I FOR ONE AM VERY EXCITED FOR THE MAUL COMIC FINALLY GETTING SOME MORE CONTENTION
R EMPIREDIDNOTHINGWRONG

YOU HAD TO GO AND BRING UP POLITICS
I DOUBT THAT WOULD HAPPEN HERE ANYWAYS
BB SLEIGH

I'LL SEE MYSELF OUT
MAY YOUR APPLE CAREER
NICE
YOU CAN

JUST WATCH EMPIRE STRIKES BACK AND THERE'S A SCENE WITH LUKE AND VADER AND LUKE TOTALLY HITS HIM IN THAT PAULDRON WHEREUPON VADER ADVANCES UPON LUKE IN THAT KIND OF MENACING LOOK

JUST WE SEE IT FROM THE SIDE ABOVE AND NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT BUT PRETTY MUCH
THERE'S NO ONE IN THIS MOVIE POWERFUL ENOUGH OR GOOD ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO VADER IN THE BIBLE NAHUM IF THIS WERE A MOVIE ABOUT EARLY YEARS IN THE SUIT HUNTING DOWN JEDI I COULD SEE IT HAPPENING BUT NOT WITH THE FODDER CHARACTERS IN ROGUE ONE
HE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE BLEEDING IN THAT PICTURE RIGHT ARM WAS CUT OFF AT THE ELBOW THIS DAMAGE IS TO FLESH
I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MOST OF THE SENATORS AFTER THE EMPIRE STARTED SHE SEEMED LIKE A INTERESTING CHARACTER
I LOVE HOW YOU HAVE BOTH LEGENDS AND CANON PLANETS ON THERE

HAD A FUN TIME SEARCHING FOR MY FAVORITE PLANET CATHAR
COULD YOU PUT THE REST OF THE CANON PLANETS ON THERE TOO
I SPENT MORE TIME READING YOUR MAP THAN I'M PROUD OF THIS IS AMAZING
DID THEY EXPLAIN HOW FIN HAN AND REY SAW BOSNIAN PRIME BLOW UP FROM TAKODANA IF THEIR NOT IN THE SAME SYSTEM
ARE THE ACTUAL LOCATIONS OF ALL THESE PLANETS CONFIRMED
IN THE SPACE BATTLE ABOVE BABOO I BELIEVE HE SAYS SOMETHING SIMILAR TO SORRY I'VE GOT NO REFERENCES
I'VE BEEN WATCHING ACW OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS HALF WAY THROUGH SEASON AND I CAN SWEAR HE SAYS THAT TOO ALMOST MULTIPLE TIMES TO ASOKA AT LEAST MAYBE REX TOO BUT LIKE YOU I CAN'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE LOL I'LL KEEP WATCHING IN THE NEXT WEEK AND KEEP YOU UPDATED

IN THE BIBLE PSALMS IT COULD BE SOMETHING JUST ALONG THE LINES OF JUST GET TO THE I'LL WORRY ABOUT THE
GOLD COMES WITH A SEASON PASS STILL GOTTA DOWNLOAD ALL THE DLC

THE BEST BET FOR BUYING IT WOULD BE PSN BUT LIMITED INTERNET SO CAN'T HELP YOU FURTHER THERE
SPIRITS AT THE END ON RETURN OF THE JEDI
IN CANON HE HELD BACK THE LEG OF AN IN THE VADER COMICS IN THE NOVEL LORDS OF THE SHIH HE GRABBED A FREIGHTER MID FLIGHT AND SLAMMED IT INTO THE GROUND SO HARD THAT IT EXPLODED IN LEGENDS HE'S DONE MANY THINGS THE ONE THING I CAN RECALL HIM DOING IS HOLDING UP A COLLAPSED CATHEDRAL THAT WAS GOING TO COME DOWN ON TOP OF HIM FOR DAYS AND THAT WAS EVEN WITHOUT HIS RESPIRATOR
SIGH YOUR MOM I'M SORRY
DON'T FORGET THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE POWERFUL WITH ALL HIS LIMBS AND NO SUIT I HAVE NO IDEA THOUGH
HE THREW THE WHOLE SENATE TO A REACTOR WITH HIS BARE ARMS AND A LITTLE BIT OF THE FORCE THAT SHIT IS BEYOND YODA
LEG IN REBELS MAYBE
MIGHT AS WELL HAVE JUST USED THE SENSATIONALIST TITLE OF THE ARTICLE ALL I CAN REALLY SAY IS GALLOWAY HAS SUCCEEDED AT WRITING AN OPINION PIECE

EVEN DIE-HARD FANS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BESIDE THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY THE LATER FILMS ARE MERE ENTERTAINMENTS SOMETIMES BETTER SOMETIMES WORSE BUT NEVER

I LOVE WHEN JOURNALISTS SPEAK FOR EVERYONE ELSE BACKED BY NOTHING BUT THEIR OWN THINLY VEILED BIAS HOW MUCH ART IS ACTUALLY IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT AT LEAST THE GUY GOT A PLATFORM TO EXPRESS HIMSELF SO PROPS FOR THAT I GUESS
TL R NOBODY THINKS STAR WARS IS VERY GOOD EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT LIKE IT ALSO I DON'T LIKE IT

NO SOURCES NO DATA FROM POST NO ORIGINAL CRITIQUE

WHAT A READ
NOR WERE PEOPLE MASSIVELY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT LAST YEAR S STAR WARS THE FORCE AWAKENS

SERIOUSLY I WISH PEOPLE WOULD STOP REPEATING THIS CRAP SURE SOME VOCAL PEOPLE HAVE ISSUES WITH IT BUT CHRIST ON A STICK IT HAS A APPROVAL RATING ON ROTTEN TOMATOES AND OUT OF ON METACRITIC

THOSE OF US WHO LOVED AND ENJOYED THAT FILM ARE IN THE VAST MAJORITY BUT IT SEEMS TO BE COOL TO SAY IT WAS PANTS BUT THAT OPINION IS REALLY IN THE MINORITY

WELCOME TO TO THE WORLD I GUESS
NOT SURE SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE HERE ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HATES STAR WARS WAS A SMART MOVE
THE GUY SAY HIMSELF HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND SW IF HE THINKS SW HAS LITTLE ARTISTIC MERIT IT'S LIKE HIS OPINION REALLY LIKE ANY RANDOM DUDE ON THE INTERNET
I APPRECIATE THIS IT'S REFRESHING BUT A LOT OF THIS IS PLAIN WRONG I FEEL DIRTY SAYING THAT ABOUT AN OPINION BUT A LOT OF ITS REASONING IS WRONG PEOPLE DO DEFEND STAR WARS AS A WORK OF ART AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY CULTURALLY ICONIC THIS ARTICLE GOES ON ABOUT THE PREQUEL AND WHILE I DO AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THEM I DON'T THINK IT'S ALL THAT RELEVANT BECAUSE THE STAR WARS PREQUEL AREN'T REALLY AS CULTURALLY ICONIC AS THE OT
THAT COULD BE THE COOLEST POSTER EVER IF IT HAD THE IMPERIAL EMBLEM INSTEAD OF THE REBEL ONE SEEMS LIKE AN OVERSIGHT
I TOOK THE LIBERTY TO REMOVE THAT REBEL PROPAGANDA FROM THIS EXCELLENT PIECE OF IMPERIAL ARTICLE HETP
DEATH TROOPERS WAY TO DO PROPAGANDA THESE ARE PEACE KEEPERS IN A VIOLENT CIVIL WAR

R EMPIREDIDNOTHINGWRONG
CAN WE GET A MON MOTHMA POSTER ALREADY
ARE THEY GOING FOR STORM-TROOPER GERMAN ARMY DEATH TROOPERS SS TYPE OF THING
WHY A REBEL SYMBOL THOUGH
WITH THE PHOTOSHOP IT ALMOST DOESN'T LOOK LIKE BEN MENDELSOHN OTHER THAN THAT COOL POSTER I GUESS
THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL ON THE DEATH TROOPERS ARMOUR IS PHENOMENAL
ARE WE SURE THAT'S ACTUALLY BEN MENDELSON LOOKS LIKE A YOUNGER CGI DOPPELGANGER
ABOUT TO DROP THE HOTTEST MIXTAPE IN THE OUTER RIM
I LIKE THE DEATH STAR BLUE PRINTS ON TOP OF KRENNIC AND HIS TROOPERS
MADE IT AN IPHONE WALLPAPER

GALLERY GIBEL
EVEN IF THIS WAS A POSTER WITH REBELS ON IT INSTEAD THE EMBLEM WOULD STILL LOOK REALLY OUT OF PLACE WITH THE STYLE OF THE POSTER OTHER THAN THAT IT'S A REALLY SICK POSTER
HAHA LOOKS LIKE ED HELMS HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BECOME 2 IN THE OFFICE
HEY THAT GUY KINDA LOOKS LIKE BEN MENDELSOHN

KINDA
SO KRENNIC CARRIES A BLASTER
DEATH STAR BREAK THIS GUY HAS THE BLUEPRINTS OF THE BASE TATTOOED ON HIS COAT
THAT IS ONE WEIRD BOY BAND
DANIEL FUCKING RAYBURN WHAT A GUY
THE REBEL LOGO IS SO HIDEOUS IN THIS OTHERWISE PERFECT POSTER
WHAT'S WITH THAT GREEN OVERLAY REFLECTION EARTHSTAR PLAN OR WHATEVER IT LOOKS UGLY AS HELL I PREFER A MUCH CLEANER IMAGE TO THIS MESS
I HOPE SOME OF THE CLONES ARE DEATH TROOPERS
MIXTAPE IS GOING TO BE
FUNGO IF THIS IS THE COVER
I THOUGHT THEY ALREADY RECANONIZED THE CLASSIC DEATH TROOPERS WITH THAT IPHONE GAME THESE DON'T LOOK LIKE ZOMBIES TO ME
SPACED THOSE WERE CALLED DEATH TROOPERS SO I WAS THINKING THIS WAS GONNA BE ABOUT THAT BOOK DEATH TROOPER WHERE STORM TROOPERS HAVE TO FIGHT OFF A ZOMBIE PLAGUE
READING CATALYST REALLY CHANGES HOW I VIEW THIS POSTER FIRST THING I THINK IS THAT MANIPULATIVE BASTARD
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES KRENNIC LOOK DIFFERENT IN EVERY PICTURE OR MOVIE SCENE THAT I SEE HIM IN
MENDELSOHN LOOKS A LITTLE OFF
DUDE LOOKS LIKE DR LEO SPACEMAN
I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT STAR WARS BUT THIS DUDE IS EVIL AS FUCK RIGHT
IS THAT ED HELMS
I LOVE HOW THE DEATH STAR PLANS ARE DISPLAYED ON THEM AS WELL SO COOL
LOVE THE TACTICAL LOOK THEY GAVE THE DEATH TROOPERS HEAD TO TOE WITH AMMO POUCHES AND EXTRA WEAPONS
WHY DOES THE LEFT HELMET SEEM SO MUCH THE DIFFERENT HEAD ANGLE AND PERSPECTIVE DOESN'T SEEM ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE DISCREPANCY IMO THE DOWNWARD CURVE AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HELMET ALSO SEEMS MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED ALLOWING FOR THE LONGER NOSE
WITH HOW MUCH THEY HAVE BEEN PROMOTING HIM I HAVE REALLY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS ACTOR
IS THAT AN ACS MUZZLE EMPIRE MUST BE DEALING WITH THEM DANG BUDGET CUTS
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S CLEARLY HIS THROAT BEFORE MAKING AN EPIC SPEECH
IS THAT A POCKET ON CAPE
I THINK IF YOU THE EMPIRE LOGO COULD BE BEHIND THEM ALL IT WOULD BE AMAZING MAYBE BLACK AND LARGER FUCK YEAH
SOMEBODY TOLD THE LATE S TO REDESIGN THE STORM-TROOPER
HIS FACE LOOKS OFFICIAL
IT TOOK ME FOREVER TO NOTICE THAT THAT'S NOT JUST SOME CRAZY PATTERN ON THE CLOTHES AND ARMOR IT'S THE BLUEPRINTS TO THE EARTHSTAR BEING PROJECTED ONTO THEM
I BET THE DEATH TROOPERS CAN'T HIT THE BROAD SIDE OF A BARN
IS THAT DR SPACEMAN
REALLY DIGGING THE MODIFIED ALT ON THAT ONE TROOPER
IT'S DANNY FROM BLOODLINE DUDE IS SUCH A LIT ACTOR HE IS GOING TO KILL THIS ROLL
NOW IF WE CAN ONLY GET A CONFIRMED RELEASE DATE THROUGH CV I NEED TO BUY MY TICKETS
WHAT'S WITH THE GREEN DECORATION ON THE DEATH TROOPERS SPACE CAMOUFLAGED
SEEMS LIKE HE'S GOT INDIGESTION AND IS ABOUT TO BURP
THE AS KENNIE

I'M IN CHARGE OF SECURITY FOR THE DEATH STAR PROJECT EVER HEARD OF IT
DOES HE FEEL IN CHARGE
BOT BEEP BEEP I'M ALL ABOUT TOP POSTS

THIS POST HAD UPVOTES AND GOT POSTED TO TWITTER AND SUBREDDIT R REDDIN

THE TWEET



ALL UPVOTES ARE ON AND R REDDIN

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL POSTS ON AND R REDDIN
THOSE DEATH TROOPERS LOOK BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THE BALANCE OR FRAMING OF THE OVERALL IMAGE SEEMS SLIGHTLY OFF TO ME
OOOH THIS IS NICE
I'M EXCITED TO SEE SOME NEW TROOPERS ESPECIALLY BEING A HUGE FAN OF THE FORCE UNLEASHED GAMES BUT WHY ARE WE SEEING DIFFERENT TROOPERS WHEN NONE OF THESE GUYS SHOWED UP IN THE OT IS ANYONE ELSE WONDERING THAT

IT'S NOT GOING TO RUIN THE PICTURE FOR ME JUST A THOUGHT
IM VERY EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE BUT DEATH TROOPERS IS A STUPID NAME
I'M SUCH A NERD
DEATH TROOPERS SIGH
DELETED
COUGH
HE LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE KID THOUGH RIGHT IS THAT JUST ME
I LOOKS TO ME THAT THERE ARE SOME ADDED FILTERS TO THESE STILLS IS THE BIGGEST GIVEAWAY

SAYING THAT I DO AGREE PHANTOM MENACE HOLDS UP THE BEST VISUALLY OF ALL THE PREQUEL
THESE FRAMES BARELY HAVE ANY CGI TO NOT HOLD UP TRY ONE OF THOSE GODAWFUL DUNGAN FRAMES
WHEN I TRY TO RANK THE PREQUEL EPISODE IS ALWAYS ABOVE 2 BECAUSE IT AT LEAST FILMED ON SETS LOCATIONS AND HAD SOME PRACTICAL EFFECTS EPISODE 2 HAS AGED THE WORST OUT OF ALL THREE
EXCEPT FOR THIS SHOT HETP
COOL IS THIS THE SEASONAL REPOST OF PREQUEL VISUAL SHOTS THAT HOLD UP SUCH AS FRAMES OF ANAKIN PALATINE WITH AMYGDALA ETC AND WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE IMPRESSED
I MIGHT BE ON THE MINORITY IN THIS BUT I THINK THE VISUAL LONGEVITY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IT WAS THE LAST ONE SHOT ON FILM
IT REALLY DOESN'T I SAW IT ON THE BIG SCREEN IN THE FFA MARATHON IN DECEMBER AND MOST OF THE EFFECTS JUST DO NOT HOLD UP AT ALL THE BEST LOOKING EFFECT NOW IS THE VERSION OF CGI YODA
I DONT AGREE IT DOES HAVE GREAT VISUALS BUT THE QUALITY WAS NEVER VERY CONSISTENT
ESPECIALLY THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN SET PIECES AND FLAT GREENSCREEN PROJECTIONS ARE VERY NOTICABLE
TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT WASNT DUE TO A TECHNICAL LIMITATION

ALSO ON A SIDE NOTE I FIND LOTS OF THE DESIGN DECISIONS VERY QUESTIONABLE SOME FEEL LIKE A DESIGN BY COMMISSION OTHERS ARE JUST BAD AND UNINSPIRED
ONE GREAT EXAMPLE IS THE JEDI COUNCIL THAT LOOKS LIKE ITS BEEN DESIGN AS A TOY SET INSTEAD OF A UNIQUE LOCATION OF A VERY SPECIAL GETUP OF PEOPLE

WHAT GETS ME IS THINKING THAT PHANTOM MENACE IS OLD STILL SEEMS LIKE THE NEW STAR WARS
I THOUGHT PHANTOM MENACE HAD SOME SERIOUSLY BEAUTIFUL AND WELL MADE SHOTS IS THE CGI NECESSARILY UP TO MODERN STANDARDS NUMBER BUT WHAT PHANTOM MENACE AND THE PREQUEL IN GENERAL CAPTURED THAT MOST A GRADE ACTION FILMS DO NOT IS THE AESTHETICS OF THE WORLD IT IS PORTRAYING STAR WARS UNIVERSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES MANY OF THE SHOTS MEMORABLE AND STILL LOOKING GREAT
TPM IS STILL BEAUTIFUL THOSE SWEEPING SHOTS OF HEED ARE AMAZING
SHOT ON FILM CLEANED UP FOR BLURRY RELEASE I WOULD SAY ALSO THEY PROBABLY PUT MORE EFFORT INTO THE LOOK SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST STAR WARS FILM IN YEARS
I THINK THE PHANTOM MENACE A LOT OF UNWARRANTED HATE YES IT ISN'T THE AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY BUT IT BY FAR ISN'T THE WORST FILM EVER MADE AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T THE WORST OF THE THE PREQUEL IN COMPARISON TO ATTACK OF THE CLONES THE PHANTOM MENACE IN MY OPINION HAS FAR MORE MEMORABLE SCENES SUCH AS THE POD RACING AND THE FIGHT BETWEEN QUI GON OBI WAN MAUL WHEREAS WITH ATTACK OF THE CLONES I FIND MYSELF CRINGING AT THE ANAKIN AND FADME SCENES AND THE FIGHT AT THE END ISN'T PARTICULARLY MEMORABLE

I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THE HATE IT RECEIVES IS DUE TO THE IT'S UNFORTUNATE POSITION OF BEING THE FIRST OF THE PREQUEL THAT WERE RELEASED AND IT THE STAIN OF BEING A DISAPPOINTMENT BUT IF YOU LOOK PAST JAR JAR AND SOME OF THE JUST CRINGE WITHIN THIS FILM IT CERTAINLY IT'S AS BAD AS PEOPLE MAKE IT OUT TO BE
BEEN ABOUT YEARS ISN'T IT BOUT TIME FOR A SPECIAL EDITION
THIS ONE HAS A LOT OF PRACTICAL THE OTHER 2 LOOK GOD AWFUL NOW THE CLONES IN THE CLONE WARS CARTOON LOOK MORE REALISTIC THAN THE CLONES IN EPISODE 2
I DON'T THINK CINEMATOGRAPHY REALLY DEGRADES
SHAME THE FILM ITSELF IS AWFUL
THIS MOVIE STILL LOOKS TERRIBLE AND IS TERRIBLE
I THINK ALL OF THE PREQUEL HOLD UP PRETTY DARN WELL THEY'RE AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL
IF ONLY THE SAME COULD BE SAID FOR THE ACTING
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT EP LOOKED GREAT GORGEOUS PRODUCTION DESIGN COSTUMES AND SHOT LIKE THESE
IF ONLY LUCAS COLLABORATED WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE WORKING ON THE FILM INSTEAD OF JUST INTIMIDATING THEM ALL TO THE POINT OF NOT SAYING ANYTHING THESE BEEN GREAT
THE VISUALS KEEP THE PANTON MENACE FROM BEING THE WORST PREQUEL
UNTIL YOU PULL UP A HIGH RES SCREENSHOT OF YODA OOF
MINUS ALL THE CGI
YEAH IT STILL LOOKS LIKE THE SAME RANDOM PILE OF DOGSHIP IT ALWAYS DID
BY THE WAY OF ALL THE PREQUEL I WOULD SAY THAY THE BEST LOOKING BITS ARE ON MUSTAFAR WHERE THE EMPEROR COLLECTS ANAKIN ALSO THE VADER HELMET SCENE IS SIMPLY STUNNING IMHO
HAS THE BEST DUEL OF ALL EP WAS IMPRESSIVE BUT WASN'T VISCERAL AND LOOKED TOO MUCH LIKE A DANCE
IT'S GOT SOME WONDERFUL ICONIC IMAGERY LOVE THAT MOVIE
IT STANDS UP WAY BETTER THAN 2 SO MANY MORE OF THE EFFECTS WERE DONE THE OLD WAY WITH MODELS AND MINIATURES INSTEAD OF OBJECTS OR SCENES BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP IN A COMPUTER BUMS ME OUT THAT EVEN FFA DIDN'T GO THIS FAR WITH THE PRACTICAL EFFECTS
IT'S SO FUNNY HOW THE BORING FLAT ANGLE IN THE MIDDLE RIGHT IS CONSIDERED VISUALLY STUNNING
THIS IS MY FAVE
AND BY THE WAY WHAT KIND OF WOOD POLISH DID WE USE ON THIS TABLE OIL SOAP THAT SHEEN IS RIDICULOUS SEND A BOTTLE OF WHATEVER IT IS BACK WITH MAUL
AS WAS EXPECTED WHEN COMING TO A POST ABOUT THERE IS MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SHORT COMING OF THE PREQUEL TRILOGY THE MOVIE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS WIDELY CRITICIZED AS THEY WERE HAD THE DIALOG BEEN ON POINT GL TRIED WAY TO HARD TO MAKE THIS MOVIE APPEAL TO KIDS AND FEMALE FANS IF IT HAD BEEN FILMED IN THE SAME MINDSET THAT SAY ROGUE IS NOW IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THAT BAD JAKE LLOYD PROBABLY WASN'T THE BEST ACTING CHOICE BUT HE IS THE PROTOTYPICAL BLONDE CAUCASIAN BOY THAT GL FELT WOULD CONNECT MOST WITH FANS I THINK HAYDEN DID FINE AS BUT AGAIN GL TRIED TO CATER TO TEENAGE GIRLS AND THE PRINCE PRINCESS ANGLE IF YOU EXCLUDE ALL OF THE CRAP DIALOGUE AND CUT THE STUPID ASS DROID COMMENTS JARJAR LOVE STORY AND JUST MADE IT A WAR MOVIE ABOUT THE GALACTIC EMPIRE VS JEDI REBELLION THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AWESOME TRILOGY SHAME THAT GL MADE A KIDS MOVIE INSTEAD OF A WAR FOCUS ADULT MOVIE
STILL AMAZING HOW ALL THE SIX ORIGINAL MOVIES HOLD UP
ALL OF THE VISUALS IN THE WORLD COULDN'T SAVE THIS TURD I TRIED TO LIKE THE PREQUEL THEY'RE JUST AWFUL
HONESTLY WE SHOULD JUST WATCH IT ON SILENT SOMEONE SHOULD MAKE A VERSION WITH ALL THE DIALOGUE REMOVED JUST THE MUSIC PLAYING
THE PREQUEL ARE GREAT IF THEY ARE ON MUTE
I THINK YOU LEFT OFF THE WORDS WHEN YOU ARE REALLY FUCKING HIGH A THE END OF YOUR TITLE
LOL HOW IS LITERALLY JUST A SHOT OF CANAKINS FACE AN EXAMPLE OF VISUAL EXCELLENCE

THESE POSTS ALWAYS CRACK ME UP
NOPE GARBAGE NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF FILTERS YOU PUT THESE IMAGES THROUGH

NAR SADA THE UNDERWORLD EQUIVALENT OF COURANT AND RAMUS PRIME A DEDICATED JUNK PLANET THE EMPIRE USES TO BUILD STAR DESTROYERS MAKES SENSE PLUS I LIKED ALL THE LITTLE EASTER EGGS IN THE JUNK


I WOULD LOVE IF SOMETHING LIKE TATTOOING WERE CANON I MEAN THERE'S SO MUCH COOL SHIT ON THAT PLANET FROM BOUNTY HUNTERS TO POD RACING
IF WE JUDGE IT BY DIRECT ACTION PROBABLY LUKE I DOUBT EVEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VARIOUS MASSACRES PERPETRATED IN THE NAME OF THE EMPIRE VADER WOULD HAVE RACKED UP A BODY COUNT EQUAL TO THE POPULATION OF THE DEATH STAR WHICH BEEN AS HIGH AS 2 MILLION


YOU COULD ARGUE VADER IT WAS HIS ACTIONS THAT ALLOWED PLANS TO CONTINUE THE REPUBLIC TO FALL THE JEDI ORDER TO BE DESTROYED THE RISE OF THE EMPIRE AND ALL OF ITS ATROCITIES OVER THE YEARS EVERY SPLINTER GROUP THAT THEY CAUSED INCLUDING THE FIRST ORDER ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY THEM ETC ALL BECAUSE ANAKIN DIDN'T KILL PALATINE UPON LEARNING HE WAS SIMIOUS PALATINE WAS ULTIMATELY AT FAULT FOR SUCH THINGS BUT THE BLOOD IS EQUALLY ON HANDS LUKE DESTROYED THE DEATH STAR VADER ALLOWED THE EMPIRE TO EXIST
LUKE KILLED MILLIONS OF INNOCENT WORKERS ON THE DEATH STAR JUST TRYING TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING PLUS ALL THE STORM TROOPERS HE'S KILLED AND ALL THE POOR PEOPLE OF BESPIN THAT HAD A HEART ATTACK WHEN THEY SAW A MAN FALLING OUT OUTSIDE THEIR WINDOWS LUKE IS THE TRUE VILLAIN OF STAR WARS
DEPENDS WHAT CONSTITUTES KILLING
LUKE KILLED MILLIONS OF INNOCENT WORKERS ON THE DEATH STAR JUST TRYING TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING PLUS ALL THE STORM TROOPERS HE'S KILLED AND ALL THE POOR PEOPLE OF BESPIN THAT HAD A HEART ATTACK WHEN THEY SAW A MAN FALLING OUT OUTSIDE THEIR WINDOWS LUKE IS THE TRUE VILLAIN OF STAR WARS
DARTH VADER BLEW UP AN ENTIRE PLANET
STARKVILLE BASE WAS A MOBILE ICE PLANET LOCATED IN THE UNKNOWN REGIONS THAT SERVED AS A STRONGHOLD OF THE FIRST ORDER THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE BATTLE OF ENDOR

FROM THE WIKI
IT IS MOBILE THE EXPLANATION ISN'T MY FAVORITE AND I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE JUST DESIGNED THE WEAPON DIFFERENTLY BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
SADLY YEAH HYPERSPACE CAPABLE AND EVERYTHING
IT'S MOBILE WHICH IS FUCKING STUPID AND IMPLAUSIBLE EVEN FOR STAR WARS
IT'S NOT MOBILE IT WAS A BASE ON A PLANET

EDIT WELL FUCK I WAS WRONG BUT BEING MOBILE IS STUPID AS HELL
BRO THIS IS MY DREAM SET UP RIGHT HERE
THAT LOOKS AMAZING LOVING THAT WALLPAPER ON THE COMPUTER SCREENS
I WENT WITH THOR INSTEAD OF CAP BUT ALSO HAVE THE AMAZING FANTASY AND IRON MAN PLAQUES THEY'RE REALLY GREAT
NO MAN CAVE IS COMPLETE WITHOUT THE POWER GLOVE NICE SETUP
YEP

EDIT AND IT'S STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO THE MARKINGS ON FOREHEAD DURING THE CLONE WARS
HER FOREHEAD MARKINGS
IMAX 2D FOR THE EXPERIENCE
CINEMARK XD 2D
IMAX 3D BECAUSE ONLY 3D SHOWINGS ARE DOING RESERVED SEATS AND MIGHT AS WELL SPRING FOR THE IMAX AT THAT POINT
IMAX IS GONE AND THE ONLY MIDNIGHT SESSIONS I COULD SEE WERE NORMAL 3D REALLY HOPE THIS 3D TREND STARTS TO DIE DOWN
IMAX 2D NICE CHANGE SINCE NORMALLY THE 3D IS FORCED ON THE IMAX SHOWINGS AT MY THEATER
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE GOTTEN TICKETS FOR IMAX 2D SAW FFA THE SECOND TIME IN AND WAS SLIGHTLY LET DOWN ONLY IN THE FACT THAT ONLY ONE SCENE WAS IN THE FULL FRAME GLORY OF IMAX

THIS TIME AROUND THEY DIDNT EVEN FILM WITH IMAX CAMERAS AND ITS A 2 HR DRIVE TO THE NEAREST SCREEN MANAGED TO GET TICKETS AT A DOLBY CINEMA SCREEN THAT JUST OPENED UP NEAR ME SO I GET TO TEST THAT OUT
IMAX
RPM WHICH I GUESS IS IMAX 2D
2D
2D

I CAN'T DO 3D BECAUSE I HAVE GLASSES AND IT JUST FEELS WEIRD TO ME I DON'T USE THE 3D ON MY EITHER
IMAX 2D HOPEFULLY BOYFRIEND CAN'T DO 3D
I'M GOING TO WATCH IT IN THE BIGGEST 2D FORMAT I CAN FIND

3D MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE
THE IMAX HERE DOES 3D AND 3D ONLY SO IT'S THAT OR A TINY THEATER

I THINK I WOULD RATHER 2D
IMAX 2D IF I CAN GET TICKETS FOR OPENING NIGHT OTHERWISE JUST 2D WITH RECLINING SEATS
CINEMARK DIGITAL 2D FOR ME NO IMAX THEATERS IN A MILE RADIUS OF ME UNFORTUNATELY I'M PLAYING A JAZZ GIG THAT NIGHT SO I CAN'T GO OUT TOO FAR

I'LL PROBABLY HEAD MINUTES NORTH OF ME TO SEE FOR THE SECOND TIME IN IMAX THO
I ALWAYS DO STANDARD FOR THE FIRST SHOWING I LIKE TO TAKE IN THE FILM IN ITS MOST BASIC FORM FOR MY FIRST VIEWING I'LL SEE THE FANCY 3D IMAX STUFF LATER IN THE WEEK WHEN I SEE IT AGAIN
GENERIC STANDARD 2D
IMAX 3D IS THE ONLY THING AVAILABLE BY ME FOR SOME REASON
2D AT A REALLY GREAT SCREEN NEAR US I'M NOT AT ALL A FAN OF 3D
IMAX 3D
IS THE IMAX 3D AT LINCOLN IN NYC THE NEW LASER PROJECTOR
NORMAL 3D BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET OV PREMIERE TICKETS
HERE AFTER I WENT TO SEE THE FORCE AWAKENS IN THIS FORMAT IT'S A MUST FOR THIS KIND OF MOVIE
IMAX 3D I LIKE 3D IT'S REALLY FUN AND EVER IMPROVING
I'M SO TIRED OF 3D ESPECIALLY IN THE SENSE THAT IT TAKES AWAY FROM SO MANY OF THE 2D CHOWTIMES

IT CAN BE A COOL WAY TO SEE A MOVIE THE 2ND TIME BUT ULTIMATELY I ALWAYS FIND 3D A BIT TOO DISTRACTING IT CAN MAKE CERTAIN ACTION SCENES STAND OUT BUT I ALWAYS LOSE FOCUS DURING THE MORE SIMPLISTIC SCENES I WISH THEY WOULD STOP PUSHING FOR NEARLY EVER MOVIE THESE DAYS TO ALSO BE IN 3D IT'S NOT ALWAYS NEEDED
HE HAS VISITED THE SET AND GARETH DID INCORPORATE SOME OF HIS IDEAS
I DOUBT HE'S SEEN IT YET I DOUBT HE'D DO ANYTHING LIKE PUBLICLY DIMINISH IT IN ANY WAY EVEN IF HE HATED IT

LIKEWISE I'M NOT SURE I CAN PICTURE HIM ADMITTING SOMETHING LIKE I WISH I'D THOUGHT OF THAT REGARDING ANYTHING EITHER
THIS INTERVIEW DETAILS HIS OPINION ON THE MAKING OF FFA
WATCH V

SOME QUOTES HERE


DESPITE HIS VISIT TO THE SET FOR ROGUE ONE AND HIS INVOLVEMENT I ASSUME HE PREFERS FILMS WITH ENTIRELY NEW ELEMENTS
HE HAS PROBABLY NOT SEEN IT YET BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE THINKS OF IT
DOES ANYONE CARE WHAT HIS THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ARE

EDIT TO EVERYONE DOWNVOTING ME LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THIS IS THE GUY WHOSE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS BROUGHT US JAR JAR BANKS MIDICHLORIANS AND HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN
CONSIDERING THAT LUCAS HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH ROGUE ONE I DON'T SEE WHY HE
WHO CARES DUDE IS AN IDEA THIEF AND A HACK WHO DIDN'T LISTEN TO PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP HIM
THE BONUS DISCS OF THIS SET IS THE ONLY WAY I WATCH STAR WARS
NOW THAT I LOOK AT THE COVERS IS THAT THE VADER FROM ROTS
AWESOME SCORE I JUST BOUGHT THOSE USED ON EBAY FOR A SMALL FORTUNE HOW MUCH WERE THEY
HOLY FUCK THAT'S AWESOME I HAVE THESE BUT BOUGHT THEM YEARS BACK ON EBAY USED
VERY NICE I GOT ANH AND ROTC BACK IN THE DAY BUT I JUST FOUND EMPIRE A FEW WEEKS BACK FOR PRETTY CHEAP ON EBAY I JUST CAN'T WATCH THE SPECIAL EDS MY BRAIN JUST NOTICES ALL THE CHANGES AND ADDITIONS AND IT DRIVES ME NUTS
DAMN THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS I STILL HAVE THOSE ON VHS GOOD FIND INDEED
NICE
MIGHT BE WORTH MONEY IN A FEW YEARS DONT OPEN THEM
DFW BLIND IN ONE EYE
I WAS JUST THINKING THE SAME THING HOPEFULLY WE HAVE BETTER LUCK THAN THEY DID MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU
I KNEW KALO WAS A HUGE CELINE DION FAN I BET THE SONG MY HEART WILL GO ON MAKES HIM THINK OF VADER
I'M A TRAILER AND TV SPOT ADDICT AND THE ONLY TRAILERS I'VE SEEN THAT END WITH VADER ARE THE FIRST TRAILER WHERE WE SEE THE BACK OF VADER AND THE INTERNATIONAL TRAILER WHERE WE SEE VADER WHERE HE APPEARS TO BE DOING THE FORCE CHOKE
HOW DOES IT START AND CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SHOT OF VADER
I HAVE A LINK TO IT BUT NAH I'M NOT GOING TO SHARE
FANTASTIC JOB HERE WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING I SERIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHY GREAT WORK LIKE THIS GETS DOWNVOTED IT REALLY BOTHERS ME I'D HOPE THAT THIS R DOESNT BECOME MALICIOUS
IMPRESSIVE MOST IMPRESSIVE
I WAS OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IN REAL LIFE WHEN THAT MUCH ENERGY TOUCHES WATER IT EXPLODES VIOLENTLY I CAN SAY ONE THING THOUGH THE WOUNDS WOULD NOT BE AS CLEAN CUT BUT MORE LIKELY TOTAL WARPING AND DISTORTION ABOUT THE WOUND SO THAT NO AMOUNT OF SURGERY WOULD REATTACH A MISSING LIMB
ALWAYS CAUTERIZED AT LEAST WITH HUMANS DIFFERENT SPECIES COULD HAVE SPECIAL PROPERTIES THAT LEAD TO THEM NOT CAUTERIZING DUE TO A DIFFERENT BLOOD COMPOSITION OR SOME SUCH
IN THE CANTINA WHEN OBI WAN CUTS OFF THE HAND OF FLY LOOKING DUDE THERE'S BLOOD
THIS IS TIGHT
BIG ADVENTURE

SAND IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER

THE DEATH OF MACE HINDU

UNDER PRESSURE

SWAMPS SKIES AND SNOWDRIFTS

ATTACK OF THE MAN-EATING TEDDY BEARS

YOU'LL GET ANSWERS IN EPISODE VIII


BACKSTROKE OF THE WESTERN
STAR WARS EPISODE JEDI PARTY

STAR WARS EPISODE 2 THE FRIEND ZONE

STAR WARS EPISODE REVENGE OF MIDDLE MANAGEMENT

STAR WARS EPISODE LASER MOON AWAKENS

STAR WARS EPISODE ATTACK OF THE PHANTOM PAST


TO ME HE HAS BEEN SO WATERED DOWN FROM THE ACW THERE WERE TIMES IN CLONE WARS WERE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE AFRAID OF HIM NOW HE IS JUST A HARMLESS TRICKSTER
HONDO BECAME A CARITACURE OF HIMSELF IN ACW HE WAS A CHARMING BAD GUY NOW HE ONLY JUMPS AROUND SPACE MESSING AROUND WITH REBELS FOR WHATEVER REASON AND MAKING A FOOL OF HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY REAL DEPTH OR SERIOUSNESS
WHY DO PEOPLE FEEL THE NEED TO WARD OFF DIFFERING OPINIONS THIS IS A KIDS SHOW RELAX
HONDO WAS ACTUALLY A REDEEMING FEATURE IN LAST EPISODE FOR ME THANKS TO HIM I WAS ABLE TO SOMEWHAT ENJOY IT DESPITE THE COMPLETELY WASTED DARK TROOPERS AND A WRITER WHO TOOK WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY A COOL SHIP DESIGN AND RUINED IT
I WANT HONDO TO POP UP IN THE YOUNG HAN SOLO MOVIE
MY PROBLEM IS HIM BEING A SHELL OF SUCH A BRILLIANT CHARACTER HE ONCE WAS IN ACW WITHOUT ANY MEANINGFUL TRANSITION HIGHLY PROBABLY BECAUSE REBELS BEING A KID'S SHOW AND THAT THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE HIM BELIEVABLE OR CONVINCING ANYHOW YET EZRA STILL TRUSTS HIM FOR SOME REASON
I LOVE HONDO HE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS
I THINK I'M MORE ANNOYED AT HOW THEY'RE USING HIM THAN THE CHARACTER HIMSELF I DIDN'T MIND HONDO IN THE CLONE WARS BUT NOW HIS STORYLINE IS A BIT UNDERWHELMING TO ME
SCREENING ARE ON DECEMBER
I'LL PIGGYBACK IN THIS AND ASK IF IT'S BEING RELEASED EARLY IN THE UK I KNOW THEY COULD BUY TICKETS EARLIER BUT WASN'T SURE OF THERE WAS AN EARLIER RELEASE DATE I WAS HOPING TO READ SOME IN DEPTH REVIEWS BEFORE HEADING TO THE THEATRE
KALO WAS BORN SHORTLY AFTER JEDI AND HE'S ALMOST IN FFA SO THERE'S A PRETTY BIG WINDOW THERE
AFTER THE END OF ROTC

DID YOU SEE LANDO IN FFA THAT'S WHY

S
HE EVEN STOLE HIS CLOTHES
YOU FORGOT NEPHEW OF THE PILOT THAT BLEW UP THE DEATH STAR I AGREE IT WOULD BE HILARIOUS IF BEN WAS A TERRIBLE PILOT

IN THE NOVEL BLOODLINE HAN HAS ALREADY LOST THE FALCON LEIA LAMENTS THAT HE NEVER TALKS ABOUT THE OTHER SHIPS THAT HE'S DUPING UP THE SAME WAY THAT HE TALKED ABOUT THE FALCON AND SAYS THAT LOVES LIKE THAT ONLY COME ONCE IN A LIFETIME BLOODLINE SPOILERS S HE ALSO SHOWS UP IN A DIFFERENT SHIP NEAR THE END OF THE BOOK BLOODLINE IS YEARS BEFORE FFA BEFORE BEN FELL AND BEFORE HAN RETURNED TO SMUGGLING HAN ALSO ISN'T STILL FRANTICALLY LOOKING FOR IT SO HE PROBABLY LOST IT SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE BLOODLINE

MY PERSONAL PET THEORY IS THAT HE LOST IT BETWEEN YEARS AFTER ROTC AND THAT HIM LOSING IT AND IT ENDING UP ON ZAKKEU IS SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO HOW REY ENDED UP THERE THE BELOVED SHIP BELONGING TO THE BROTHER-IN-LAW OF THE GALAXY'S LAST JEDI MASTER AND A HIGHLY FORCE SENSITIVE LITTLE GIRL END UP NOT ONLY ON THE SAME BACKWATER PLANET BUT WITH THE SAME GUY THAT CAN'T BE COINCIDENCE THERE'S MORE TO THAT STORY
PRETTY SURE HE LOST THE FALCON BECAUSE JJ COULDN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY FOR HAN AND CHEWIE TO MEET THE NEW CHARACTERS
THAT WHOLE SERIES IS OUTSTANDING

DARK FORCES
DARK FORCES II JEDI KNIGHT
DARK FORCES III JEDI KNIGHT II JEDI OUTCAST
DARK FORCES IV JEDI KNIGHT III JEDI OUTCAST II JEDI ACADEMY

OUTCAST IS MY FAVORITE BUT I STILL LOVE THE ORIGINAL DARK FORCES ALTHOUGH THE LOW RES TEXTURES GEOMETRY 2D SPRITES AND PRIMORDIAL FIRST PERSON SHOOTER MECHANICS MAY SEEM ARCHAIC TO GAMERS NEW TO THOSE EARLY FPS GAMES

I STILL WANT TO BE KYLE KATAR WHEN I GROW UP
AS A MAC OWNER IN WHO WAS UPSET THAT LUCASARTS MADE A GREAT MAC VERSION OF DARK FORCES THEN DID NOT DO A MAC VERSION OF DARK FORCES 2 I PLAYED THIS THE REALLY HARD WAY ON WINDOWS RUNNING IN THE VIRTUAL PC EMULATOR ON A POWER MACINTOSH WITH A VOODOO CARD IT ACTUALLY WORKED AND I THINK IT WAS ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE VOODOO CARD WAS 3D ONLY IT DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANYTHING EXCEPT DRAWING THE GAME SO THE GAME LOOKED GREAT DESPITE EMULATION AND ONLY LAGGED WHEN THE EMULATED CPU COULDN'T KEEP UP LOGICALLY IN SOME BUSY PARTS ALSO THE SOUNDTRACK WAS CD AUDIO AND SO THE MUSIC WASN'T TAXING THE EMULATION EITHER
YES
SUCH A GREAT SERIES
I'VE ACTUALLY PLAYED AND LOVED EVERY INSTALLMENT ASIDE FROM THE ORIGINAL DARK FORCES

I PLAYED JEDI OUTCAST FOR ABOUT A YEAR OF MY LIFE ONCE I WAS THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN I GOT CREATIVE USING A CLEVER COMBINATION OF CHEAT CODES I LEARNED TO MAKE MY OWN LEVELS
YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO ACCESS ON THIS SERVER

ENTER AGAIN WORKS

SHE LOOKS TOO OLD FOR A YOUNG LEIA THATS MY OPINION

EDIT SHE IS BORN IN THATS RIGHT NOW CARRIE FISHER WAS IN ANH
I'M NOT SEEING THAT AT ALL
A YOUNG CARRIE FISHER LOOK-ALIKE

UM MAYBE FOR YOU
VADER AND SHATTERED EMPIRE ARE THE BEST OF THE NEW CANON IMO

STAR WARS AND LANDO ARE REALLY GOOD TOO
I WOULD DO LANDO FOR SURE IT'S A SHORT RUN AND REALLY MAKES A RECATCH OF EMPIRE STRIKES BACK BETTER TO ME
VADER AND STAR WARS ARE GREAT JUST MAKE SURE YOU READ THEM TOGETHER IN THE PROPER ORDER
LANDO VADER STAR WARS AND SHATTERED EMPIRE ARE MY FAVORITES I WAS HAPPILY SURPRISED WITH LANDO IT TURNED OUT MORE INTERESTING THAN I THOUGHT IT COULD BE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE OTHER THREE AS WELL
HAN SOLO COMIC IS PRETTY GOOD IF YOU ASK ME
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER REPASTING THIS WITH A MORE COHERENT TITLE
RUN THIS BY ME ONE MORE TIME

THESE ARE ALL PRETTY COMMON AND ARE OLD STOCK WE ARE ON WAVE NOW AND MOST PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE ITCHING TO GET THE DARTH BEVAN AND SABINE FIGURES

YOU MAY WANT TO POST IN R STARWARSCOLLECTING INSTEAD
DELETED
FETT

BOBA IS CURRENTLY BOTH DEAD AND ALIVE IN THE SARLAC PIT
I DON'T RECALL BOBA FETT HAVING A CANNON IN THE NEW CANON YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY I GUESS
THERE IS SOME MATERIAL IN STAR WARS REBELS THE CREW OF THE GHOST HAVE A FEW WITH MANDALORIANS AND THERE ARE SEVERAL EPISODES IN STAR WARS THE CLONE WARS THAT FEATURE THEM ADAMIK THE CARTOONS ARE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SNAPSHOT OF THE CULTURE AS A WHOLE IN CURRENT CANON
WELL FOR ONE I'M PRETTY SURE ANGO AND BOBA AREN'T MANDALORIAN IN CANON ANGO JUST LIKED AMANDO ARMOR AND BOBA KEPT TO THAT TO HONOR HIS FATHER

THE MOST CANON INFO ON BANDALORE COMES FROM ACW AND REBELS EPISODES AND I THINK THE ASOKA NOVEL TOUCHES ON THE SIEGE OF BANDALORE AT THE BEGINNING

BASICALLY DURING THE PREQUEL ERA AND THE BEGINNING OF THE CLONE WARS BANDALORE WAS ATTEMPTING TO TURN AWAY FROM ITS WARRIOR HISTORY AND BECOME A WORLD OF PEACE AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR DEATH WATCH A MILITANT MANDALORIAN FACTION SOUGHT TO OVERTHROW THE PEACEFUL GOVERNMENT AND RETURN BANDALORE TO ITS OLD WAYS

EVENTUALLY THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL WITH SOME HELP FROM DARTH MAUL WHO BECAME RULER OF BANDALORE FOR A TIME

AFTER THE WAR BANDALORE WAS THE SITE OF AN IMPERIAL ACADEMY I THINK AND SOME MANDALORIANS JOINED THE EMPIRE AS A SORT OF SPECIAL FORCES STORM-TROOPER UNIT

I'M PROBABLY MISREMEMBERING SOME OF THIS MIND YOU BUT THAT'S WHAT I RECALL
THEY AREN'T MADALORIAN BUT THE ARMOR IS
MAN THAT IS ONE ANNOYING VOICE TAKING FOREVER TO GET TO THE POINT FOR NO REASON AT ALL GONNA GO COOL OFF A HEADACHE
THE UNIVERSE IT'S LIKE A LIVING AND BREATHING UNIVERSE WITH UNLIMITED STORIES
HONESTLY I WATCHED THESE MOVIES GROWING UP AND I STILL ENJOY THEM I AM JUST FASCINATED BY THE SPECIAL AFFECTS AND ALSO THE STORY INTRIGUES ME I'VE GOTTEN LEGO SETS POSTERS AND MAD LIBS ABOUT STAR WARS
THERE'S A GREAT MIX OF LEVITY AND LORE
IT'S IN MY DNA
I GREW UP ON STAR WARS YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE INTRODUCED TO THE OT FIRST BUT STILL ONLY WHEN THE PHANTOM MENACE WAS RELEASED IT CAPTIVATED MY MIND IT WAS MY FAVORITE THING TO PLAY WHEN I WAS AN ADOLESCENT IT WAS MY SOLACE FOR ANGST TEEN SHIT AND I JUST NEVER GREW OUT OF IT THE SITH AND THE JEDI STILL SEEM LIKE THE COOLEST PROTAGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS I CAN IMAGINE AND THE UNIVERSE IS RICH FULL AND ACCESSIBLE
I THINK NOT JUST STAR WARS BUT ALL OF THE SERIES THAT PEOPLE GET REALLY INVESTED IN ARE SERIES THAT HAVE REALLY RICH WORLD BUILDING YOU JUST FEEL THAT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO EXPLORE BEYOND WHAT WHAT IS SHOWN AND HINTED AT FOR THE SAKE OF THE STORY IT MAKES YOU WANT TO LEAVE OUR BORING WORLD BEHIND AND LOSE YOURSELF IN THIS MORE EXCITING PLACE
LIGHTSABERS JEDI STARSHIP DOGFIGHTS BLASTER SHOOTOUTS RESCUES BATTLES ROGUES VILLAINS HEROES WIT TRIUMPH TRAGEDY STAR WARS JUST HAS IT ALL
I GREW UP WITH IT IN THE BACKGROUND HAVING SEEN ALL THE PREQUEL IN THEATERS AS A KID BUT DIDN'T REALLY GET INTO IT AS A BIG FAN UNTIL THE SPRING OF

IT HAS A LOT OF GREAT CHARACTERS AND WORDBUILDING WITH A RICH SANDBOX TO PLAY IN YOU HAVE THE TRAGEDY OF THE PREQUEL WHERE A SOCIETY ROTS AND COLLAPSES INTO A DICTATORSHIP WHILE THE SAME HAPPENS TO PEOPLE INTEGRAL TO THAT SOCIETY YOU HAVE THE TRIUMPH OF THE OT WHERE GOOD OVERCOMES EVIL AND IN THE END IT IS COMPASSION AND LOVE THAT SAVE THE DAY

THERE'S SO MUCH MYTHOLOGY THAT AT TIMES STAR WARS FEELS LIKE A FANTASY WEARING THE CLOTHES OF A SCI-FI SERIES THEN AT OTHER TIMES IT FEELS LIKE THE FAIRYTALE TROPES ARE JUST THE AESTHETIC AS IT BREAKS AND RECONSTRUCTS THEM

ALSO YOU CAN LAUGH AT THE GOOFY STUFF GO AHEAD
BECAUSE OF THE SOUNDTRACK AND SCENERY
THE MYTHOLOGY THE THEMES THE VAST UNIVERSE OF THE SAGA CREATED BY GEORGE LUCAS AND LUCASFILM THE STYLE OF ACTING ACTION DRAMA CINEMATOGRAPHY THE MUSIC AND THE STORY INCLUDING THE CREATIVITY AS WELL
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WITH ME MY ENTIRE LIFE FROM TO THIS VERY DAY
I ACTUALLY WROTE A LONG POST ABOUT IT WHEN FFA CAME OUT IN ORDER TO SAVE TIME I'LL JUST PROVIDE THE LINK TO IT BELOW

WHAT TIME IS THE EARLIEST SHOWING
NICE FANDANGO IS TIMING OUT BIG TIME BUT I STILL WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE AIX
ME TOO

I KNEW
I THINK KNOWN
NOPE ALTHOUGH IT WAS TOTALLY OBVIOUSLY
PROBABLY NOT MANY IF ANY BUT I ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT SIGNIFICANCE IT HAS TO ANYTHING
PALATINE PROBABLY JUST READ MIND TO FIND OUT I THINK PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE WHO KNEW BOTH OF THEM KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON BUT MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW HOW FAR IT WENT I HAVE A FEELING THAT ASOKA WAS TOLD OR SOMEHOW MANAGED TO FIGURE OUT JUST HOW CLOSE THEY WERE AND MAY HAVE GUESSED IT TOO AND JUST PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW UNTIL ROTS
DIDN'T KNOW BECAUSE HIS MEMORY WAS DELETED AFTERWARDS
I'M SURE OBI WAN HAD A SNEAKING SUSPICION
IT DEPENDS ON WHERE THEY GO WITH HIS CHARACTER RIGHT NOW HE'S A VILLAIN BUT I'M VERY CERTAIN THAT HE'LL BE AN ANTI-HERO BY THE END OF THE TRILOGY
IT'S PRETTY VILLAINOUS TO KILL A GROUP OF JEDI STUDENTS THAT'S LIKE CONSIDERING A SCHOOL SHOOTER AN ANTI-HERO ANAKIN ALSO KILLED CHILDREN HE WAS DEFINITELY A VILLAIN
DUDE KILLED HAN SOLO THAT'S AS VILLAINOUS AS YOU GET
HE'S MORE OF AN
HE MURDERED HIS FATHER AND MENTALLY TORTURED TWO OF THE NEW CAST MEMBERS HE'S STRAIGHT UP EVIL
I WOULD CONSIDER HIM A VILLAIN IN THE FORCE AWAKENS AS HIS STORY PROGRESSES MAYBE HE WILL CHANGE MAYBE NOT
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT HE'S ALL DOING IT FOR I SUSPECT THERE MIGHT BE A LOT MORE TO HIS STORY THAN THEY'RE TELLING US RIGHT NOW THOUGH
THE KIDS WERE A BIT IRRITATING I DIDN'T HATE IT THOUGH SOME COOL SHOTS IN THERE INTERESTING TO SEE SOME INTERACTION BETWEEN THRAWN AND KONSTANTINE AND INTERESTING TO SEE EZRA RELATE TO KIDS WHO WERE SIMILAR TO WHAT HE ORIGINALLY WAS NOT THE GREATEST EPISODE BUT IT DIDN'T BREAK MY FAITH IN FILION
BECAUSE A BUNCH OF KIDS BEATING THE EMPIRE MAKES THEM LOOKS INEPT AND TOOTHLESS ALSO THOSE KIDS WERE PRETTY ANNOYING AS CHARACTERS
BECAUSE IT WAS AWFUL AND THE YT WAS ALREADY CANON
HONESTLY I PREFERRED IT TO THE HARDTOSPELL JOB WE GOT TO SEE CAPITAL SHIPS FIGHTING EACH OTHER DIRECTLY HONDO WAS NICE BUT THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD SAVE AN EPISODE THAT COMPLETED WASTED THE DARK TROOPERS AND MISTOOK EXTERNAL CARGO CONTAINERS FOR A PART OF THE SHIP
I GUESS IT WAS NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED AFTER A 2 WEEKS WAIT IMO I THOUGHT IT LACKED SUBSTANCE BUT IT WAS NICE TO SEE EZRA TRYING TO REACH TO OTHERS LIKE HIM

MY BF WASN'T CONVINCED HE HADN'T WATCH THE PREVIEWS OR FOLLOWED THE SUBREDDIT SO HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS EPISTLE HE IMMEDIATELY JUMPED FROM HIS SEAT AS SOON AS HE SAW THE YT APPEAR

DASH FUCKING REIDAR YES

NUMBER

THAT'S DASH REIDAR SHIP THE OUTRIDER

THE SAME MODEL NOT THE SAME SHIP

DASH REIDAR

SIT DOWN

AAAAAAAAARGH ノಠ益ಠ ノ彡

HE SPENT THE MOST OF THE EPISODE CHEWING ON THE KIDS SAYING THEY DIDN'T DESERVE THE SHIP XD
OLDER FANS TEND TO HATE THESE KIND OF EPISODES BECAUSE THEY ARE KIDDY BUT DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A KIDS SHOW THAT CAN BE WATCHED BY ANYONE NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
I FOUND IT FORGETTABLE BUT NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE ARE SAYING
THE SHOW HAS A LOT OF INTERESTING SIGNIFICANT STORYLINES GOING ON RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOT THRAWN YOU'VE GOT MAUL YOU'VE GOT EZRA SLIPPING TOWARDS THE DARK SIDE PLUS ALL OF THE OTHER CHARACTER ARCS OF THE PRINCIPAL CAST THAT'S EASILY A WORTH OF TELEVISION THAT COULD BE MADE JUST FOCUSSING ON THOSE COMPELLING TOPICS BUT EPISODES LIKE WHAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING THE PAST FEW WEEKS DON'T GIVE US ANY OF THAT PEOPLE CALL THESE EPISODES FILLER BECAUSE IT GENUINELY FEELS LIKE THE SHOW IS JUST BIDING IT'S TIME UNTIL WE GET TO THE MEAT EPISODES TYPICALLY AROUND THE FINALE AND THE MIDSEASON FINALE THE PROBLEM THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE IS THAT THESE JUST FOR FUN ADVENTURE EPISODES SHOULD BE THE MINORITY OF EPISODES IN ANY GIVEN SERIES WHEREAS IN REBELS IT FEELS LIKE THAT'S THE MAJORITY
BAD DIALOGUE IMO
ONLINE OR IN PERSON
EITHER THIS IS AN IMAX SHOWING THAT HAVE BEEN ON SALE FOR A WHILE OR SOMEONE IS GETTING FIRED
GETTING THE SITE MAINTENANCE PAGE ON FANDANGO THIS IS GONNA BE FRUSTRATING IT WAS FINE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO WHEN REFRESHING
I KEEP CHECKING THE FANDANGO APP AND THEY HAVE CHOWTIMES LISTED FOR ALL THE THEATERS IN EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS BUT NOT THE AMC THEATER THAT IS RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD FROM ME HOPEFULLY THE CHOWTIMES WILL BE POSTED AFTER OTHERWISE IT LOOKS LIKE I'M HEADED TO THE THEATER TOMORROW TO BUY THEM IN PERSON
LOOKS LIKE A GARDEN GNOME
REALLY GLAD THEY DID NOT CHOOSE THIS HOW WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE A GREAT WARRIOR
YEAH IT'S A WELL KNOWN EARLY CONCEPT A LONG WITH THE MORE TROLL LOOKING VERSION VERY COOL TO SEE IN PERSON THOUGH
THAT CAN'T BE YODA HOW WOULD DWIGHT FOLD HIM IF HE LOOKED LIKE THAT
WELL HE MADE HIS OWN ARMOUR AND THE SLAVE ONE WAS REALLY DAMAGED AND THEN REPAIRED BY HONDO AND THAT'S WHY IT HAS IT'S COLOR SCHEME

I THINK MOST OF HIS OTHER STUFF WAS ON AMINO AND I'M NOT SURE THE JEDI WOULD LET HIM TAKE IT
I CAN SEE HIM KEEPING HELMET IN HIS SHIP BUT NOTHING ELSE I DON'T WANT MUCH OF ANGO OR THE FORCE SHOWING UP IN A BOBA FETT MOVIE TO BE HONEST THE STORY I WANT TO SEE FOR BOBA DOES NOT INVOLVE LAMENTING OVER HIS DEAD CLONE TEMPLATE A TRIBUTE TO ANGO SURE BUT OTHERWISE BOBA NEEDS TO BE HIS OWN CHARACTER AND NOT RELY ON VISUAL CUES AND NOSTALGIA MOMENTS AND STORY ARCS
HUH SO VADER ISN'T THE TALLEST MAN ON THE DEATH STAR ANY MORE WOULD BE A GOOD SET UP FOR ANOTHER HEAD BANG JOKE
AREN'T THE DEATHTROOPERS AROUND

ALSO THEY CLEARLY DON'T EXIST AFTER ROGUE ONE SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO ME
THEY AREN'T ACCORDING TO THIS CHART WONDER WHERE IT CAME FROM
MY PROBLEM WITH THE DEATH TROOPERS IS THAT I THOUGHT THAT THEY'D BE HIS OWN PERSONAL GUARD AKIN TO THE RED CLOAKED IMPERIAL GUARDSMEN WHO ACCOMPANY THE EMPEROR

WHY BECAUSE VADER IS ALL ABOUT DAT BLACK HIS FLEET IS CALLED DEATH SQUADRON THE SAME NAME GIVEN TO HIS TIE FIGHTER GROUP AS WELL DEATH
AND SO THEY MAKE DEATH TROOPERS TWO METRE TALL AND ALL DRESSED IN BLACK BUT THEY'RE NOT HIS AAAARGH DISAPPOINTMENT
YOU MEAN OUR GREAT EMPEROR'S IMPERIAL PALACE REBEL SCUM
AND IN THE NEW CANON THAT'S ACTUALLY THE IMPERIAL PALACE PALATINE REALLY ENJOYED THE SPOILS OF VICTORY TAKING THE HOME AS HIS OWN
I KNOW IN LEGENDS IT WAS REBUILT AND USED AS SOME IMPERIAL HEADQUARTERS I BELIEVE
IT SEEMS WEIRD THAT PEOPLE ON CORUSCANT WOULD BE CELEBRATING IN THE STREETS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DEATH STAR IT'S NOT LIKE THE EMPIRE JUST COLLAPSED AS SOON AS IT BLEW UP THEY'RE STILL THERE DOING THEIR THING

WAS THE EMPIRE DISLIKED ON CORUSCANT OR AT LEAST IN THE UPPER LEVELS
IS THAT FROM THE REMASTERIES FINALE OF THE MOVIES NICE DETAIL REGARDLESS
ONE OF THE GREAT CHANGES ADDED IN SPECIAL EDITIONS
THOUGHT ALL US NERDS KNEW THIS
PALATINE TURNED IT INTO A STRIP MALL

AS A SIDENOTE IT ALONG WITH THE SENATE BUILDING WAS ADDED TO THE GALAXY CELEBRATING EMPIRE'S DEFEAT AND EMPEROR'S DEATH SCENES IN FOR THE FIRST RELEASE OF THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY ON DVD IT REAPPEARED DUH IN AND LATER RELEASES
AT THE TIME OF SW EPISODE VI ROTC IT'S THE IMPERIAL PALACE
FLAMING HOT NEWS FROM

ITS EVEN IN THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE

WIKI

IN THE CORUSCANT CELEBRATION SHOT THE GALACTIC SENATE AND JEDI TEMPLE HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE BACKGROUND
ITS THE DISNEY CASTLE IN THE NEWEST RELEASE
THAT SCENE IS FAR LESS HEARTWARMING WHEN YOU REALISE THAT IN THE NEW CANON IT TURNS INTO A RIOT WHICH IS BRUTALLY PUT DOWN BY IMPERIAL SECURITY FORCES
IN THE NEW CANON IT'S GALACTIC HQ
I HAVE TO SAY THERE'S A LOT OF POETRY IN THE JEDI TEMPLE A FOUNTAIN OF LIGHT BEING TAKEN OVER BY THE SITH AFTER THE JEDI WERE DESTROYED THE JEDI ARE ALL WIPED OUT AND THEIR SANCTUARY OF LIGHT IS CORRUPTED INTO A SHRINE TO THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE THE DARK SIDE TAKES EVERYTHING OVER AND THERE'S NO PLACE THAT'S SAFE FROM ITS INFLUENCE
THATS A BLURRY ADDITION RIGHT
ONE OF THE FEW THINGS ADDED TO THE OT THAT I REALLY LIKE I FEEL LIKE IT TIES THE TWO TOGETHER NICELY
THEY FIXED IT HUH
I DON'T GET IT
R
WIKI GUM
YOU WERE SO PREOCCUPIED WITH WHETHER OR NOT YOU COULD
LOOKS LIKE KRANG FROM NINJA TURTLES
GOD I WISH THAT WERE ME
DAMN ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A FULL SIZE COPLAY
QUICK FIRST IMPRESSION

I'M A BIG FIGURES COLLECTOR I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH HOT TOYS MEDICO DRAGON BLUE BOX ETC FEEL FREE TO AMA

IT'S NOT JUST THE SHINNY BLACK ARMOR THERE ARE A LOT OF SUBTLE WEATHERING INVOLVED PRETTY DETAILED

THE NIGHT VISION AT THE LOWER CHIN LIGHT UP IN A SUBTLE FASHION BATTERIES ARE INCLUDED IT DOES NOT GLOW IN THE DARK BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THE GREEN SHADE IN THE DARK

DEFENCE A COLLECTIBLE PIECE AND NOT A TOY

HOT TOYS FIGURES ARE KNOW TO BE TALLER THAN MOST OR FIGURES DEATH TROOPERS ARE SUPPOSE TO BE FT TALL SO I THINK THAT FITS IN WELL

TO SEE THE 3D REPRESENTATION IN PERSON YOU'LL REALLY APPRECIATE HOW THE DESIGNER TOOK THE AESTHETIC ENHANCED IT AND MADE IT FITS WELL WITHIN THE STAR WARS TIMELINE

MG NOT INCLUDED IN THE SET

WHOA
THATS AWESOME I FINALLY GOT TO SET UP MY FIRST ORDER TIE PILOT
I EXTREMELY WANT ONE
I'VE BOUGHT ABOUT ONE OF THESE TO GO WITH MY OTHER TROOPERS BUT I JUST HATE THE WAY THE HELMET LOOKS IT'S LIKE A HORSE HAD A BABY WITH A CLONE TROOPER I JUST CAN'T DO IT THERE'S A LOT OF AWESOME BUT THAT FACE
CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THESE GUYS HOPEFULLY TEAR THE REBEL SCUM UP ON THE BIG SCREEN
ONLY COSTS A SMALL LONE OF A MILLION DALLAS
UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY MODEL KIT THAT WAS EVER AVAILABLE WAS A LIMITED RUN RESIN KIT THAT CAME OUT DURING THE HEYDAY OF ALLIANCE EARLY


THESE DAYS THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK TO GET A PHYSICAL MODEL IS TO HAVE ONE 3D PRINTED THERE SEEMS TO BE QUITE A FEW 3D MODELS AVAILABLE ONLINE
I THINK SO A FEW OF THE TRAILERS SHOW A WHOLE BUNCH OF SPACE ACTION I'M TOTALLY WITH YOU THE NEW MODERN CG SPACE BATTLES ARE SO COOL
LOOKS LIKE IT ACCORDING TO THE NEW TRAILER
AT LEAST UNTIL THEY GET THOUGH THE PLANETARY SHIELD ABOVE SARIF LIKE YOU SEE THE PILOT ATTACKING IN THE TRAILER
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE IN REBELS DYING WE KNOW THESE KIDS DIE AND WHILE STILL KIDS MOST LIKELY
FROM HIS TWITTER

THE YOUNGLING EPS WERE GONNA BE REMOVED FROM AND PUT TOGETHER AS ITS OWN POTENTIAL PILOT MOVIE FOR A SERIES THAT NEVER HAPPENED
THAT ARC WAS A FAN FAVOURITE AMONGST LUNGANS PERHAPS
A YOUNGLING NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE POST EPISODE ERA WE SIMPLY CAN'T HAVE A SET ENDING FOR THIS
WOULD HAVE HATED THE PREMISE FOR THIS
THANKS THE FORCE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN LIKE EPISODE ABOUT GYBER CRYSTALS WAS GOOD PROBABLY THE FOLLOWING ONE WHERE THEY WERE CONSTRUCTING LIGHTSABERS WAS GOOD TOO BUT OTHER 2 TERRIBLE LIKE IRON SQUADRON AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE A WHOLE SERIES ABOUT THEM NO JUST NUMBER
STUPID COMMENT BUT I REALLY LIKE THEIR OUTFITS
HAVE YOU READ THE NEW JEDI ORDER AND DARK NEST SERIES LOAF FOLLOWS DIRECTLY FOLLOWS ON FROM THOSE SO YOU MIGHT BE QUITE LOST IF YOU HAVEN'T
YES AS LONG AS YOU AREN'T BOTHERED BY THE FACT THAT THE SERIES ISN'T CANON ANYMORE
DESPITE THE OBVIOUS RIP OFF OF CINEMASINS FORMAT I AGREED WITH EVERYTHING HE SAID ESPECIALLY THAT ENDING PART THE PREQUEL ARE PART OF THE STAR WARS SAGA WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT NOW I'M NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO LIKE IT BUT COMPLETELY DISMISSING IT ISN'T SOMETHING SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS TO BE A FAN OF A FRANCHISE DOES

I LIKE THE PREQUEL I GREW UP WITH THEM BUT I STILL THINK THEY'RE GOOD YES THEY HAVE PROBLEMS BUT I DON'T THINK THEY TAKE AWAY THE IMPACT OF THE ENTIRE STORY

OH ALSO MAUL LIVING IS CANON
THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY WASNT AS GREAT AS PEOPLE MAKE IT OUT TO BE ITS MOSTLY BETTER THAN THE PREQUEL BUT A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS PEOPLE POINT OUT IN THE PREQUEL ARE PROBLEMS IN THE ORIGINALS AS WELL THE DIALOGUE IS WEIRD AND DOESNT MAKE SENSE SOMETIMES SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE REVOLUTIONARY FOR THEIR TIME BUT MOST DIDNT AGE WELL AS WELL AS THE PLOTS WERE QUESTIONABLE IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE PEOPLE SEE THE ORIGINALS THROUGH ROSE TINTED GLASSES AND LOVE TO HATE THE PREQUEL I GREW UP ON THE PREQUEL AND LOVE THEM AND THE ORIGINALS JUST AS MUCH I CAN ALSO SEE THE BLATANT FLAWS IN EPISODE SO I CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEING IN THIS POSITION FOR THE PREQUEL I CAN ALSO SEE PEOPLE SEEING THE BLATANT FLAWS IN THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY WHO WEREN'T KIDS WHEN THEY FIRST SAW IT
I PERSONALLY CAN'T STAND ANY SORT OF RIP OFF OF CINEMASINS I BELIEVE THEY WORK HARD TO MAINTAIN THEIR BRAND AND TO HAVE COME UP WITH SUCH A GREAT AND ORIGINAL IDEA WITH A COOL FORMAT AND CHANNELS LIKE GAMINGSINS OR CINEMAWINS ONLY SERVE AS CHEAP KNOCKOFFS WHO STOLE THE CINEMASINS FORMAT AND ALTERED IT SLIGHTLY FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL GAIN

EDIT SORRY NOT STAR WARS RELATED
EVERYTHING GREAT CAN BE SUMMED UP IN A FEW WORDS WATCH

LIAM NEESON SEEING CORUSCANT FOR THE FIRST TIME POD RACE DUEL OF THE FATES THE END CREDITS

SEE DONE
IS IT A MINUTE AND SECOND VIDEO
SORRY CAN'T WATCH EVEN THIS SHORT CLIPS IT'S OOOO BAD THIS WAS THE MOVE THAT MADE ME FALL OUT OF LOVE WITH STAR WARS I HATE THE PREQUEL REALLY HATE THEM THE HOWEVER MADE ME REMEMBER WHY I LOVED STAR WARS IN THE FIRST PLACE

AND THE BEST VERSIONS OF THE ORIGINALS ARE THE DESPECIALIZE EDITIONS REALLY GREAT
POSSIBLY BECAUSE STORM-TROOPER IS THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF A GERMAN WORD WHICH IS ONE WORD NOT TWO AND SO THE TRANSLATION REMAINS THE SAME
SANDTROOPER SPACETROOPER SNOWTROOPER AND SHORETROOPER ARE ONE WORD OR WERE YOU NOT TALKING ABOUT STORM-TROOPER VARIANTS
SOMETIMES THEY COMBINE IT AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T BUT TECHNICALLY THEY ARE ALL STORM-TROOPER JUST DIFFERENT SPECIALIZATIONS OF THEM WHICH IN ITSELF COULD BE THE EXPLANATION
JUST WATCH IT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
TRUST ME YOU WANT TO WATCH IT CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU'D WATCH THE FIRST EPISODE IN A EPISODE ARC AND YOU WOULD SEE THE REST OF IT UNTIL THE NEXT SEASON
I WATCHED THE SERIES RECENTLY HAVING NOT SEEN ANY OF IT OTHER THAN THE MOVIE I WATCHED IT IN EPISODE ORDER BECAUSE I WAS TOO LAZY AND I WOULD SAY IT'S WORTH IT TO WATCH IT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER

THERE'S NO REASON TO WATCH IT IN RELEASE ORDER IT'S NOT LIKE THERE ARE REVEALS LIKE VADER IN EMPIRE THAT ARE A COMPELLING REASON TO WATCH IN RELEASE ORDER YOU'LL HAVE AN EASIER TIME KEEPING UP WITH THE PLOT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS I DON'T MIND IF THE SERIES JUMPS AROUND THE TIMELINE

YOU SHOULD IF YOU WATCH IT IN RELEASE ORDER SOMEONE DIES AND COMES BACK LATER IN THE SHOW LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED CHRONOLOGICAL IS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO WATCH NO MATTER WHAT THE INTENDED WATCH ORDER WAS THEY DIDN'T MAKE THEM IN RELEASE ORDER SO IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN OUTRIGHT STATE THAT RELEASE ORDER WAS THE INTENDED WAY TO WATCH EITHER THEY JUST MADE EPISODES THEY KNEW THEY HAD THE ASSETS FOR ONE OF THE MIDDLE EPISODES IN SEASON ACTUALLY LOOKS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE SEASON BECAUSE THEY WERE WORKING ON IT WHEN THEY WERE MAKING THE MOVIE
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WITH ACW SOME PEOPLE CLAIM THAT A COUPLE CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS IN CHROMO ORDER AREN'T AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY ARE IN AIRED ORDER BUT I DISAGREE I WATCHED IN CHROMO ORDER MY FIRST TIME THROUGH

CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER JUST MAKES THINGS SLIGHTLY EASIER TO FOLLOW IT WON'T RUIN ANY BIG REVEALS FOR YOU BUT IT FLOWS BETTER WHEN BINGED THAN AIRED ORDER DOES
DUNNO LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND ONE
I'M FROM NEW JERSEY BUT LIVING IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR COLLEGE
IS COOL AND ALL BUT HONESTLY I'D PREFER TO SEE ROGUE ONE ON A DIGITAL IMAX SCREEN IN 2D

WHY CAN'T THAT BE AN OPTION
SO I SAW FFA AT THE INDIANA STATE MUSEUM AND IT WAS FANTASTIC I'M SURE SOME OLDER THEATER WITH AREN'T GREAT BUT I ENJOYED IT
HEY THAT PLACE IN FLORIDA IS WHERE I SAW THE FORCE AWAKENS NOT ON PREMIERE DAY THOUGH

EDIT HERE'S SOME CRAPPY PICTURES I TOOK 2 AND

THE NOT THE BEST SINCE I HAD TO KINDA TURN MY HEAD TO LOOK AT THE LEFT AND RIGHT PARTS OF IT AND I WAS SITTING IN THE BACK
I'D RATHER GO OUT OF MY WAY FOR LASER
ALABAMA SCIENCE SPACE CENTER

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME

YEARS AGO I DROVE HOURS TO SEE STAR WARS EPISODE II ON IMAX THERE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER IT'S A PLANETARIUM THE SEATS ARE ELEMENTARY CHAIRS TILTED TOWARDS THE CEILING I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS TERRIBLE I WAS PISSED OFF THE ENTIRE HOUR DRIVE BACK

WHEN FFA CAME OUT THIS THEATER WAS ON THE LIST FOR SCREENINGS I SAW SEVERAL POSTS HERE ABOUT HOW SHITTY IT WAS I PUT UP A WARNING GOT SEVERAL LIKES COMMENTS

I HAVE NO CLUE HOW THIS PLACE GOT THE SHOWING AGAIN I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT
I'M SO GLAD THEY INCLUDED BAIL ORGANA IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE AS HE'S A LEADER OF THE REBELLION AND IT'S A GREAT CONNECTION TO THE PREQUEL THE REFERENCES TO HIM IN ANH ALSO IT'S AWESOME TO SEE JIMMY SMIT IN A REBELLION OUTFIT
CAN'T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW HAPPY I AM ABOUT THIS GREAT WAY TO FURTHER CONNECT THE TRILOGIES
THIS AND MON BOTHA AS WELL VERY GLAD TO SEE THEM BACK
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ASSUMED THAT HE DIED ON ALDERMAN BUT COULD THIS MOVIE CHANGE THAT I'M EXCITED
IT'S GONNA BE SO SAD TO WATCH A NEW HOPE AGAIN AFTER SEEING HIM APPEAR IN ROGUE ONE
I THINK THEY SHOULD ADD MORE PREQUEL CHARACTERS TO THE ANTHOLOGY FILMS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE OLD CANNON CAPTAIN PANAKA BECAME AN IMPERIAL MOFF I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN WITH THE NEW CANNON
LAST WORDS IN THE MOVIE

YEAH WE WON GUYS PARTY ON ALDERMAN THERE'S GONNA BE BEER CHICKS GOOD MUSIC IT'S GONNA BE A BLAST
DID THEY SERIOUSLY CITE US AS A SOURCE WITH A PICTURE OF A PICTURE NO LESS
NICE FUCKING LOVE ME SOME JIMMY SMITS

WITH HIS PRESENCE I WONDER HOW MUCH THEY'LL FORESHADOW THE DESTRUCTION OF ALDERMAN IN THIS MOVIE LIKE WAS THE EMPIRE AWARE OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THE REBELS
AWESOME SMITS WAS GREAT AS BAIL AND I'M GLAD TO SEE HIM BACK
WORSE THAN CINEMA SINS LOL
YOUR POST HAS ME SUPER CONFUSED BUT HERE IS A PAGE WITH A HELPFUL READING ORDER



VADER DOWN IS A CROSSOVER EVENT BETWEEN STAR WARS AND VADER COMIC LINES INVOLVING STAR WARS COMICS ISSUES WELL BEFORE SANA SHOWS UP IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY
I'M GONNA GO WITH IT HAPPENING OFF SCREEN WE MIGHT GET SOME MORE INSIGHT INTO WHAT LUKE IN OBI WANS JOURNAL IN ONE OF THE UPCOMING ISSUES AS I KNOW HIS JOURNAL IS GOING TO BE A SPRING OFF POINT INTO AN OLD YODA ADVENTURE
LUKE LEARNS OF THE JEDI TEMPLE ON BROGANS VAS FROM A HOLOCRON IN STAR WARS ISSUE
PRETTY SURE HE IS GOING TO DIE
HE FIGHTS THE EMPIRE WITH THE SHEER POWER OF HIS MOUSTACHE
HE'S CALLED GENERAL MERRICK
I LOVE THAT TEAL COLORED REBEL HELMET
LOOKS LIKE THEY TOOK INSPIRATION FROM US AIR FORCE LEGEND ROBIN OLDS EVEN HAS THE MUSTACHE

WIKI
IT'S COOL THEY GOT SOMEONE'S DAD TO FLY AN
WELL HE WANTED TO GET BACK IN SPACE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I SUPPOSE TIME TRAVEL WORKS
I HOPE ONE DAY I CAN BE AS HAPPY AS THIS GUY
A TRUE FIGHTER PILOT HE'S GOT THE BULLET PROOF MUSTACHE TO PROVE IT
THE SECOND I CLIMBED INTO THE COCKPIT OF AN YOU COULDN'T SLAP THE SMILE OFF MY FACE EITHER
PERSONALLY IF I WAS PUTTING TOGETHER SOME PILOTS TO TAKE DOWN THE EMPIRE I'D MAKE SURE I PICKED PEOPLE WHO LOVED THEIR JOBS I HAVE NO TIME FOR SLACKERS WHO GET A TARGET LOCK ON THE PROTON TORPEDOS THEN JUST LET THE COMPUTER DO THE WORK AND START THINKING ABOUT SPACE CREPES
SULLY
THE LOOK OF HIS FLIGHT SUIT IS SO NICE I WISH POE GOT LIKE A BLACK FLIGHT SUIT WITH HIS
HE LOOKS LIKE BRYAN CRANSTON IN MALCOM IN THE MIDDLE I LOVE IT
PERKINS BROTHER DORKING
NICE TO SEE THEY WENT PERIOD PIECE ON THIS ONE AND GAVE US THE S MUSTACHE
COLONEL CHRIS HADFIELD MADE IT FURTHER OUT INTO SPACE THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT
IS THAT THE SAME ACTOR AS THE PRIEST FROM THE EXORCIST SHOW
HE LOOKS LIKE DALE EARNHARDT
JUST SO YOU KNOW PUTTING A COMMA BETWEEN NEW AND FAVORITE MAKES IT MEAN HE'S YOUR NEW CHARACTER AND YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTER NOT YOUR FAVORITE NEW CHARACTER
MARVEL COMIC SERIES CONFIRMED
HOW IS THAT SCREENSHOT SO HUGE
LOVE THE COLORS OF THE HELMET DOES ANYBODY ELSE THINK HE KINDA LOOKS LIKE WALTER WHITE
PLO KOON BAH
ABYLA


HOTNESS PERSONIFIED

ADDLE

IF YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW WHAT A FEMALE YODA LOOKS LIKE
HOPPO RANCISIS BEARDED SNAKE JEDI WHO HAD ONLY ONE SENTENCE TO SAY IN CANON STAR WARS COMICS JEDI HOLOCRON ARCHIVES
PROBABLY BARRIOS COFFEE ACTUALLY NOT VERY MINOR BUT SOMEWHAT OF A SECONDARY CHARACTER SHE DOES HAVE SOME EPISODES WHERE SHE REALLY SHINES THOUGH ESPECIALLY THAT LAST ARC HER WHOLE DISS ALLUSION WITH THE JEDI WAS REALLY INTERESTING
QUINLAN VOS IS GREAT
DEFINITELY ADDLE

I'D GO WITH PLO KOON
AYNE CARRICK THOUGH HE IS THE STAR OF HIS OWN COMIC SO MAYBE NOT SO LITTLE BUT HE WAS DESIGNED TO BE A LOT LESS IN TUNE TO THE FORCE AND A LOT MORE CLUMSY THAN MOST OF THE JEDI WE SEE ARE

IF I HAD TO PACKAGE IT UP WITHOUT A COMIC OR BOOK SERIES TO HIS NAME THEN I WOULD PICK SCOUT OR LOWBACCA BECAUSE WHO DOESN'T LOVE A WOOKIEE JEDI

NO LOVE FOR MADAME JOCASTA
PLO KOON
DISNEY CANON BARRIOS COFFEE LOVED HER IN THE EU PORTRAYALS AS A JEDI HEALER IN THE NOVELS LOVED HER PORTRAYAL IN CLONE WARS INITIALLY WASN'T THRILLED ABOUT HER TURN BUT IN HINDSIGHT IT AT LEAST ALLOWED HER TO SURVIVE THE WAR UNLIKE HER EU VERSION WHICH WAS BLOWN UP BY HER OWN TANKS DURING ORDER HOPING TO SEE HER RETURN AT SOME POINT

EU TOUGH ONE GOING WITH A SPLIT FIRST TALLISIBETH AKA SCOUT JEDI YOUNGLING IN SEARCH OF A MASTER KIND OF A SHIT ONE AT THAT SHE WAS BARELY ABLE TO CALL UPON THE FORCE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY AND WAS ON THE VERGE OF WASHING OUT OF THE ACTIVE PORTION OF THE JEDI ORDER WHEN IT ALL COLLAPSED FELL IN LOVE WITH HER DURING A SPARRING DUEL WHEN SHE BESTED A BETTER FIGHTER BY GRABBING HIS WEAPON BY THE BLADE AND PUNCHING HIM HE PROTESTED THAT IT WASN'T A VIABLE MOVE WITH REAL LIGHTSABERS WHICH SHE COUNTERED WITH NO BUT THESE AREN'T REAL LIGHTSABERS WHICH THEIR INSTRUCTOR HAD TO ADMIT WAS TECHNICALLY TRUE AND ALLOWED IT

THE OTHER IS BETAIN JEDI COMMANDER DURING THE CLONE WARS THOUGH LIKE SCOUT SHE WASN'T A VERY GOOD JEDI WILLING TO DO WHATEVER SHE ORDERED HER MEN TO DO SHE REALIZED THAT SHE MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN BATTLE WITH A GUN AFTER SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF TIME WITH BOTH THE REPUBLIC COMMANDO OMEGA SQUAD AND THE NULL ARC TROOPERS THEY ASSOCIATED WITH SHE TOOK UP A CONCUSSION RIFLE BASICALLY THE STAR WARS VERSION OF A BG PREFERRING IT OVER A NORMAL BLASTER FOR THE KICK AND FIREPOWER IT POSSESSED DESPITE THE HEFTY WEIGHT OF THE WEAPON ALSO NOTABLE FOR FALLING IN LOVE WITH ONE OF THE CLONE COMMANDOS AND HAVING HIS CHILD PLANNING ON LEAVING THE JEDI ORDER AND BECOMING A MANDALORIAN WIFE WITH HIM AFTER THE WAR
ABYLA THE BLUE BADASS SECURE

RAHM SCREW THE ORDER AND THEN THE EMPIRE WE'RE DOING IT LIVE KOTA

BETAIN I'M IN LOVE WITH A COMMANDO OR ALTERNATIVELY BETAIN I HAVE A CONCUSSION RIFLE
I'M GOING WITH KANAN
ANY OF THE CLONE COMMANDOS OR THE MAIN TROOPERS IN CLONE WARS
WELL THEY'RE RIGHT FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW
WELL HE BECAME VADER SO KIND OF
WELL JUST LOOK AT THAT MUG AND HIS ARREST RECORD
IS STILL BETTER THAN STREAMING EVEN AT THE SAME RESOLUTION
THE BLURRY LOOKS WAY BETTER THAN THE STREAMING IMO LOOKS AMAZING
PROBABLY NOT THEY DON'T OWN THE DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS FOR THE CLONE WARS
SADLY THEY WON'T
ACW SHOWED THIS COOL DISPLAY OF EVOLUTION INTO A CYBORG HETP
SOMEONE DONE GOOD AT ENGLISH
OH NEVER REALIZED HE WAS A KHALEESH GUESS WHY THOSE BONE MASKS ALWAYS LOOKED SO FAMILIAR
DELETED
DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATION ON ANY MEDIA ON HIS PAST
YOU MEAN GENERAL DOOM HAHA GOOD ART THOUGH

EDIT IM NOT AN IDIOT I KNOW THEY ARE TWO SEPARATE UNIVERSES
WHILE I AM A FAN OF HAVING SOME OF THE DELETED SCENES BE CANON ITS NOT AS EASY AS JUST RERELEASING THE MOVIE THOSE SCENES AREN'T ACTUALLY AS IMPORTANT AS YOU CLAIM AND IF THEY DID THIS FOR ROTS WHY NOT DO IT FOR EVERY OTHER STAR WARS MOVIE
R TITLEGORE
I LOVE THE TIGHT PACING OF ROTS ADDING THOSE SCENES ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT NECESSARY TO THE FILM OR THE SAGA
ANYBODY ELSE FEEL LIKE NOW THAT GEORGE IS OUT OF THE STAR WARS GAME THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY FURTHER ALTERATIONS TO EPS
OH WOW IT LOOKS MAGNIFICENT VERY SHARP AND WELL DETAILED
HOLY SHIT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL

SERIOUS ABOUT THIS HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU SELL THAT TO ME FOR I WANT THAT ON MY WALL ASAP
ONE OF THE BEST SHIPS IN THE GALAXY THAT IS REALLY WELL DONE
THAT'S GORGEOUS
THAT'S NOT A PAINTING THAT'S LITERAL SEX ON A CANVAS
PLEASE MAKE ONE OF A STAR DESTROYER OH PLEASE
I ACTUALLY SAID OUT LOUD AWIWI THAT'S SO COOL ON THE TRAIN DO YOU HAVE A WEBSITE OR ANYTHING I'D LOVE TO SEE OTHER STUFF YOU'VE DONE
IT FEELS LIKE YOUR SOURCE OF LIGHT IN THE ROOM MATCHES WITH THE SUN'S POSITION IN THE PAINTING
THE RUNNER IS MY FAVORITE SHIP TO ECHO THE OTHER USER HOW MUCH WOULD YOU SELL THIS FOR VERY INTERESTED
WOW YOURE EXTREMELY TALENTED WOULD YOU CONSIDER SELLING AND SHIPPING ONE TO AUS PM ME IF YOURE KEEN TO DISCUSSION IF NOT ITS ALL GOOD GREAT WORK
THIS IS EXQUISITE

WOULD WANT BIG IN A FRAME WOULD LOOK BITCHING IN A BACKLIT FRAME
VERY COOL
OOOO I MEMBER
AMAZING ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE SHIP
WOW THAT IS AMAZING I WISH I HAD THAT SORT OF TALENT
JOHN AND RALPH MCQUARRIE WOULD BE PROUD
LOVE IT MAY WANT TO CONSIDER DATE ON THE BACK THOUGH
THEY'VE HIT OUR MAIN REACTOR WE'RE DOOMED
I MEMBER CORVETTES
REBEL SCUM
SUPER RAD YO
ADD ME TO THE LIST OF PEOPLE CURIOUS ABOUT GETTING THIS OR SOMETHING LIKE IT DO YOU HAVE A PORTFOLIO OR COMMISSION INFO ETC
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
THAT IS A NICE PANTING YEP VERY NICE
THAT LOOKS GREAT
WOULD DEFINITELY BUY A PRINT OF THAT GREAT WORK
WOW I ACTUALLY LOVE YOU
WHAT'S THE PRICE TAG ON IT
VISUAL STYLE IT REALLY REMINDS ME OF A LOT OF THE GREAT SCI-FI ART FROM THE AND
GREAT JOB
WOW THAT LOOKS AMAZING DO YOU DO ANYTHING ON COMMISSION
LOOKED LIKE A LEGO SET FOR A SEC
WOW THAT IS INCREDIBLE YOU HAVE A TRUE GIFT
THAT LOOKS AMAZING
JUST YOU INTERESTED IN PAYING FOR A CUSTOM STAR WARS IDEA
IT'S AMAZING YOU NEED TO WATCH HOW MUCH NEGATIVE SPACE YOU LEAVE AROUND THE IMAGE THOUGH OR SOME WILL BE LOST IN FRAMING AND MATTING IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL
IS IT JUST ME OR IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE BACKGROUND THAT AT FIRST GLANCE MAKES IT SEEM LIKE THE PAINTING IS SUPPOSED TO BLEND IN
INCREDIBLE
PRETTY GOOD
WAIT HOW T DO THEY STEER THOSE THINGS THEY ONLY HAVE ONE GIANT SET OF THRUSTERS ON THE BACK
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR IT
THAT IS SO AWESOME YOUR PAINING IS LIKE HIGH DEFINITION I'D RATHER SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON MY WALL THEN THE FEW CRAPPY ONES I BOUGHT AT MARSHALS
THAT IS AMAZING WORK GREAT JOB
EXCEPTIONAL WORK WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS IN MY LIVING ROOM
OH MY GOD OP THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IF ONLY I HAD YOUR TALENT
DAMN NICE JOB BUDDY
THATS THE BEAUTY OF IT ALL WHEN THE MOVIE COMES OUT WE WILL ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN IT
THEY JUST NEED TO HAVE A TECHNICAL READOUT OF THE STATION THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE STATION PLANS ARE PROBABLY IN SOME TYPE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PLANNING PLACE UNDER HEAVY PROTECTION HENCE ALL THE GROUND BATTLES IN THE TRAILERS
I'M SURE THE CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE INVOLVES INFILTRATING THE DEATH STAR HENCE AYN IN THE IMPERIAL SUIT TO DOWNLOAD A DETAILED SCHEMATIC OF THE STATION ALL THE WHILE EVADING DARTH VADER
COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER MYSELF
I FEEL THERE'S THERE'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT DOESN'T LIKE STAR WARS WITHIN THAT THERE'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THAT GROUP WHO HATES STAR WARS AND WITHIN THAT THERE'S A SMALL SUBSET CALLED HARRISON FORD WHO LOATHES STAR WARS
I THINK WE NOW KNOW WHY FORD LANDED IN THE HOSPITAL ON THE FFA SET JJ JUST HAD TO ASK
HARRISON FORD PURPOSELY CRASHED THE PLANE AND PURPOSELY HAD JJ CLOSE THE FALCON DOOR ON HIM BECAUSE SOMEONE MENTIONED DOING ANOTHER HOLIDAY SPECIAL
I LAUGHED OUT LOUD AT THIS FOR A WHILE CAN'T BELIEVE I HADN'T SEEN THIS YET
THIS IS SO GREAT
SAME
MY DREAM OLD REPUBLIC ARMY OF SITH AGAINST THE JEDI MANDALORIAN WARS MAYBE BEVAN OR EXAR KUN OR BANE DEPENDING HOW THEY WANT TO DO THE TIMELINE IN THIS CANON

MORE REALISTIC LUKE AND BEN BETWEEN AND REBUILDING THE JEDI ORDER DEPENDING ON HOW THIS TRILOGY ENDS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS REY AND LUKE OR WHOEVER IS STILL ALIVE REBUILDING THE JEDI ORDER YET AGAIN AFTER OR MAYBE BOTH AND THE TIMELINE IN THE MIDDLE CAN BE FOCUSED ON KALO AND THE KNIGHTS BUT THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY
THE BANE LINAGE A STAR WARS SERIES

THERE ARE WHISPERS AND LEGENDS FROM A GALAXY FAR AWAY OF A SMALL GROUP CALLING THEMSELVES THE SITH

THIS ANTHOLOGY SERIES CONSISTING OF SELF CONTAINED STORIES FROM THE BANE LINE OF THE SITH

THERE WILL BE SEASONS CONSISTING OF EPISODES EACH

EACH HALF SEASON WILL FOCUS ON TELLING THE STORY OF ONE BABITE SITH EACH DIRECTED BY SOMEONE DIFFERENT AND IN A DIFFERENT ANIMATION STYLE WITH OF COURSE CONTRADICTORY VIEWS ON EVENTS IN THE STORY

THE OVERALL ARC WILL BE VADER AS DIRECTED BY FILING IN DEEP MEDITATION SURROUNDED BY MANY HOLOCRONS WITH EACH HALF SEASON HIM DELVING INTO THAT PARTICULAR SITH LORDS HOLOCRON

THUS THE STORYLINE WILL BE CANON FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW AND LEGEND FROM OTHERS
WHAT I WANT

OLD REPUBLIC EVEN IF IT'S LARGELY A NEW VERSION AWAY FROM LEGENDS

WHAT WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET

MORE OT OR SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE SEQUEL TRILOGY
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ROGUE SQUADRON SPACE BATTLES AND A NEW MISSION EACH WEEK
PERSONALLY I WOULD ENJOY A SHOW BASED ENTIRELY AROUND WHAT HAPPENED IN BETWEEN EPISODES AND WITH LUKE COPING WITH THE NEWS OF HIS FATHER AND HONING HIS SKILLS AS A JEDI DURING THIS SERIES WE WOULD PAY ATTENTION TO LIFE LIVING WITHOUT HAN AND HOW IT EFFECTS THE MISSIONS THEY GO ON AND THOSE MISSIONS DIRECT EFFECT ON RESCUING HIM

THIS SERIES WOULD END WITH AN EPISODE THAT SORT OF STRAYS AWAY FROM LUKE AND LEIA AND FOCUSES ON LEARNING ABOUT THE SECOND DEATH STAR AND GETTING AN OFFICIAL CANON LOOK AT BETHANKS
OLD REPUBLIC FOR SURE
OLD REPUBLIC
BUT WHY WHY WOULD THEY NEED TO MAKE AN UNNECESSARY CONNECTION LIKE THAT

I DON'T THINK IT'S TINFOIL OUT OF THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY

IF IT'S NOT THERE IT'S BORDERLINE
THE GANGSTERS ON SHIP WEREN'T ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRST ORDER THEY WERE JUST ANSWERING A FLYER ON A BULLETIN BOARD AND READ BLOODLINE IT TELLS HOW THE FIRST ORDER GETS STARTED
DIDN'T HE ONLY HAVE IN THE MOVIE
AS SOMEONE WHO GOES TO MOVIES OFTEN PLEASE DON'T WAIT UNTIL HE'S SO HE'S NOT DISTRACTING TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO PAID TO SEE THE FILM AS WELL
NO
A MATINEE
YOU REALLY SHOULD WATCH THE MOVIE BEFORE SHOWING IT TO A YEAR-OLD STAR WARS MOVIES CAN GET PRETTY VIOLENT CUT-OFF HANDS TORTURE PEOPLE BEING BURNED ALIVE


AS A PARENT SURE GO FOR IT AS A SINGLE GUY OR ANYONE ELSE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR SOMEONE TALK THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE NO
ONLY IF YOU CAN INSTILL IN HIM THE VALUE OF SHUTTING THE HELL UP IN THE THEATER
ONE THING TO CONSIDER MIGHT BE TO WAIT A FEW WEEKS OR A MONTH OR SO AND FIND A THEATRE TIME THAT WON'T HAVE MUCH ATTENDANCE IF THERE'S ONLY LIKE PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE PLACE AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN SITTING NEAR THEM IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS MUCH OF A BIG DEAL AS IF YOU WERE TRYING A SOLD OUT OPENING WEEKEND SHOWING

I KNOW SOME PLACES ALSO DO SHOWINGS OF MOVIES SPECIFICALLY FOR PARENTS WITH YOUNGER KIDS THEY TURN THE VOLUME DOWN A LITTLE AND DON'T TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN AS MUCH IF ANYWHERE NEARBY IS DOING THAT KIND OF THING THAT COULD BE SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO THERE'S NO ISSUE BRINGING SMALL KIDS TO A SHOW SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TOWARDS SMALL KIDS BEING THERE
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON YOU AS A PARENT THE MOVIE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE QUITE VIOLENT IT'S A WAR MOVIE AND THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE ALL OF OUR HEROES WILL DIE AT THE END SO IF YOUR SON HAS A GENERALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING THAT VIOLENCE IS BAD AND DEATH HAPPENS EVEN TO GOOD PEOPLE GO FOR IT BUT IF NOT I'D AT LEAST TRY TO READ A PARENTS REVIEW AS SOON AS ONE BECOMES AVAILABLE IT IS RATED PG AFTER ALL
GO TO A SHOWING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAYTIME THEIR SHOULDN'T BE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE AND IF ANY DISTRACTIONS OCCUR IT WON'T RUIN THE EXPERIENCE FOR ANYONE ELSE BUT YOU SHOULDN'T LET HIM SKIP IT ENTIRELY STAR WARS IS FOR EVERYONE
YOU KNOW YOUR KID BEST THE BIT YOU DON'T KNOW YET IS WHAT'S IN THE MOVIE MIGHT HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUR AND OTHER PEOPLE'S ENJOYMENT OF THE FILM IF HE DECIDES TO NOPE OUT IN THE MIDDLE I'D BE INCLINED TO AT LEAST SEE IT BEFOREHAND

ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS WHETHER HE IS OK WITH FAVORITE CHARACTERS GETTING KILLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE WE KNOW THAT DEFINITELY HAPPENS WITH SOME POSSIBLY ALL MAJOR CHARACTERS

WHEN MY KIDS WERE LITTLE I TRIED TO SHOW THEM THE GREAT ESCAPE MY DAUGHTER WAS OKAY WITH IT UP UNTIL SHE REALIZED THAT ALL THE CHARACTERS SHE HAD GROWN TO LOVE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE MOVIE WERE GOING TO BE KILLED IN THE SECOND

SHE ASKED ARE THEY ALL GOING TO DIE AND I SAID UH YEAH PRETTY MUCH AND THEN SHE LITERALLY RAN FROM THE ROOM SCREAMING

PARENTING ERROR I DEFINITELY DIDN'T THINK THAT ONE THROUGH BEFOREHAND

KIDS ALSO CHANGE A BIT WHEN THEY ARE VERY LITTLE AND SOMETIMES SCARY THINGS ARE LESS SCARY WHEN THEY ARE REALLY SMALL AND MORE SCARY WHEN THEY ARE A BIT OLDER AND MORE AWARE SO HEADS UP ON THAT

IN GENERAL IT FEELS LIKE YOU COULD GET AWAY WITH NOT TAKING HIM IF YOU DON'T BLAB ABOUT IT WITH HIM AFTER ALL IT'S NOT LIKE HIS FRIENDS ARE GOING TO HASSLE HIM FOR NOT SEEING THE MOVIE
THANKS FOR THE INPUT EVERYONE
I WOULDN'T TSH
CALL YOUR LOCAL THEATERS I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY HAVE A SPECIAL KIDS SCREENING WHERE HE WON'T DISRUPT ANYONE ELSE OR JUST DON'T TELL HIM IT'S COMING OUT UNTIL MARCH YOUR CALL
A SMALL CHILD RUINED MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH FFA HE KEPT KICKING MY SEAT PLEASE DON'T RENT IT FOR HIM
FOR A REASON
DON'T BE THE GUY THAT RUINS MY THEATER EXPERIENCE BY BRINGING YOUR LITTLE KID WHO CAN'T KEEP STILL AND KEEPS MAKING NOISES THANKS
AS A FELLOW PARENT OF A YEAR OLD I SAY NUMBER I AM GOING TO CONSIDER TAKING HER TO SEE EPISODE VIII BUT I THINK ROGUE ONE IS A LITTLE EARLY FOR HERALDRY
IT'S GONNA BE FULL OF CHEERING AND STUFF THE WHOLE MOVIE SO I THINK YOU WILL BE OKAY MY FIRST STAR WARS MOVIE WAS WHEN I YEARS OLD FOR REVENGE OF THE SITH AND IT IS NEXT TO EP ONE OF MY FAVORITE MEMORIES EVER
DO IT YOU'D BE A GREAT PARENT
YOU SAY LEFT OUT LIKE HE WAS A MAJOR FILM CHARACTER OR THE SHOW WAS ADAPTED FROM THE COMICS

HE WAS A CHARACTER CREATED FOR THE COMICS AND FEATURED IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORIES TO THOSE GEORGE WAS TELLING SURE GEORGE PINCHED ABYLA SECURE BUT ONLY BECAUSE HE SAW HER IN A PARTICULARLY COOL PIECE OF ARTWORK USED AS A COVER FOR ONE OF THE COMICS

I MEAN DON'T GET ME WRONG IS AWESOME AND I'M SURE HE COULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE CANON IN THE RIGHT STORY IF THERE'S AN AUTHOR WHO CARES ABOUT HIM BUT I WOULDN'T GET YOUR HOPES UP ABOUT HIM APPEARING ON THE BIG SCREEN
A HISPID JEDI WOULD BE COOL BUT I DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING ON THE BIG SCREEN
IT WAS NO TROUBLE AT ALL WHEN TICKETS CAME OUT IN THE UK LAST WEEK ROGUE ONE IS BEING HYPED UP MUCH LESS THAN FFA WHICH WAS BASICALLY A RELAUNCH OF THE BRAND INTO MAINSTREAM PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS
I ASK BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO GRAB ABOUT TICKETS IN A ROW AT MY NEAREST IMAX LAST YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE I'M HOPING THIS YEAR I CAN MAKE IT WORK

AFTER THAT I WANT TO GO TO FANDANGO AND GRAB 2 TICKETS TO THE SUNDAY SHOWING SO I CAN GET ONE OF THOSE DOPE POSTERS
GOT MY TICKETS AROUND EASTERN TIME LAST YEAR FOR FFA I GOT OPENING NIGHT PERFECT SEATS BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN THE THEATER
WE HAVE ONE THING THE EMPIRE DOESN'T HAVE WE'RE DESPERATE

CLASSIC HONDO RIGHT THERE
I WISH AZMORIGAN DIED NOT ONLY BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HIM BUT IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN HONDO AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT IT AND FOR EZRA TO BE EVEN MORE DISILLUSIONED WITH HONDO BECAUSE OF THAT BUT ALSO I DON'T LIKE HIM

EDIT BUT OVERALL I LIKED IT IT WAS FUNNY AND PRETTY AND SOMEHOW THEY ACTUALLY MADE ME SCARED FOR EZRA AND LIFE WHEN THEY FELL REACTION WAS GREAT
IT WAS A FUN LITTLE EPISODE I LOVED THE BANTER AT THE BEGINNING ABOUT I STILL OWN HER AND DON'T BE BLIND TO THIS OPPORTUNITY

HONDO IS STILL A LOVABLE BASTARD
I QUITE ENJOYED IT FOUND MYSELF LAUGHING AT SOME OF THE HONDO MOMENTS AND IT WAS A NICE EPISODE BREAK FROM FIGHTING THE EMPIRE SENTRY DROIDS AND THE BACKDROP PROVIDED A NICE ACTION SEQUENCE AT THE END PERHAPS
I HOPED THE SENTRY DROIDS WERE MORE THAN SENTRY DROIDS EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM COULD HAVE CHANGED IF AP SAID THERE'S A SHIPMENT OF EXPERIMENTAL DROIDS OR SENTRY DROIDS DON'T USUALLY GUARD THESE SHIPS BUT GIVEN THE CARGO THEY WERE ASSIGNED TO THIS

SOMETHING TO HINT THAT THOSE DROIDS WERE SPECIAL
FILLER EPISODE BUT THE FUNNY KIND NOT THE BAD KIND WE GOT LAST WEEK
THIS WAS A MUCH BETTER EPISODE VISUALLY BEAUTIFUL TOO
I REALLY ENJOYED THIS EPISODE HOPE WE SEE MORE OF EZRA CHALLENGING AUTHORITY LIKE THIS I DON'T WANT HIS DARK SIDE TEMPTATIONS AT THE START OF THE SEASON TO BE AS FAR AS THAT PLOWLINE GOES
VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THIS EPISODE GREAT ANIMATION AND VERY FUN PLOT FILLER IN A SENSE BUT IT ALSO CONTINUES THE PROTON BOMB SUBPLOT FROM EARLIER AND OF COURSE HONDO WAS AMAZING PROBABLY HIS BEST EPISODE YET GLAD TO SEE AP AND MELCH RETURNING
I FIRMLY BELIEVE HONDO IS THE SINGLE MOST LIKABLE CHARACTER IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE BE IT CANON OR LEGENDS
THAT UNCAUGHT AKA THE FRIENDS WE MADE ALONG THE WAY HETP IS TOTALLY SNOKE YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST FOLKS

EDIT ADDED LINK
AT LEAST IT WAS BETTER THAN THE LAST EPISODE I WAS HONESTLY EXPECTING A CHARACTER TO DIE TOWARD THE END THOUGH
SOME TRUTH IS BETTER THAN NO TRUTH OBI WAN WOULD AGREE
REALLY HAPPY IT LOOKS LIKE EZRA IS FINALLY GOING TO BE DONE WITH SHIT I THINK HE'S A GOOD CHARACTER FOR A QUICK FILLER CHANGE OF PACE EPISODE BUT MFG IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE ALREADY HAD SO MANY EPISODES WITH HIM AND THEY'RE BASICALLY ALL THE SAME PLOT
I'M NOT ONE TO BE A DOWNER BUT DID ANYONE ELSE THINK THIS EPISODE WAS KINDA BAD

ANTICS ARE ALWAYS FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING BUT I THINK THE HORSE IS GETTING BLOODIED AT THIS POINT IF THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE HIM A SERIOUS ADDITION TO THE CHARACTER LIST I'D PREFER IF HE DIDN'T JUST SHOW UP EVERY FEW EPISODES TO SCAM THE REBELS AGAIN THIS EPISODE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT BROUGHT VERY MUCH TO THE TABLE I MEAN AFTER ALL IN A SEASON WITH NONE OTHER THAN GRAND ADMIRAL THRAWN HIMSELF WHO WANTED TO SEE AZIMORGAN I'M ALSO GETTING THE FEELING THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THAT RIVALRY AGAIN ANYTIME SOON AS MUCH AS I WISH IT WAS FORESHADOWING PERSISTENT DARKNESS IN THE BOY

THE EPISODE HAD MORE THAN A FEW REDEEMING FACTORS HOWEVER THE PROTON BOMBS WERE FINALLY ACQUIRED BY THE CREW AND ONCE AGAIN LINES WERE GREAT DON'T BE BLIND TO THIS OPPORTUNITY I JUST THINK THAT THE MORE SERIOUS ACHIEVEMENT COULD HAVE HAPPENED COMPLETELY SO THAT THIS TIME SLOT COULD BE DEDICATED TO A BETTER MORE RELEVANT EPISODE

BUT OH WELL I'M NOT GOING TO CRY OVER TWENTY-TWO MINUTES OF SPILLED MILK THIS BEEN GREAT OTHERWISE
I THINK COMPARED TO LAST WEEK THIS FELT MORE LIKE REBELS HONDO IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS AND THERE IS EVEN SOME CHARACTER BUILDING THE WAY WE KEEP SEEING EZRA CHALLENGE AUTHORITY ALSO LIKE THE INTRODUCTION OF SENTRY DROIDS REMINDS ME A BIT OF DARK TROOPERS AND HK
I ALWAYS GRIMACE WHENEVER IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER HONDO EPISODE BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT HE HAD ME LAUGHING BY HIS SECOND BLIND JOKE QUALITY FILLER RIGHT HERE
I WISH FOR ONCE HONDO WOULD GO BACK TO HIS RUTHLESS ATTITUDE HE DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE A SPACE PIRATE A GREEDY WEIRD UNCLE CHARACTER DOESN'T HELP THIS HIS CREW ISN'T A BUNCH OF OTHER GUYS WHO CAN THEORETICALLY MUTINY HIM
SO ON THE ONE HAND HONDO WAS GREAT AS USUAL AND WE GOT TO SEE SOME DARK TROOPERS

ON THE OTHER HAND THEY WEREN'T REALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS DARK TROOPERS AND ALSO WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THAT FREIGHTER THE DESIGN IS OBVIOUSLY INTENDED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ITS HAULING CARGO PODS BUT NOW IT HAS A CARGO BAY RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM DID THE PERSON WHO WROTE THIS EPISODE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THEY WERE DOING
A GREAT EPISODE IN TERM OF HUMOUR PACE ACTION BUT I WOULD HAVE HOPE FOR A MORE DARK CONCLUSION THE LINES

HONDO FRIENDSHIP IS ITS OWN REWARDS

EZRA YOU REALLY MEAN THAT WHILE SMILING

FELT A BIT TOO HAPPY FOR AN EPISODE WHERE WE CLEARLY SHOW THAT HONDO DIDN'T HESITATE TWO TIMES TO ABANDON AIMO THE UNCAUGHT AND JUST AFTER EZRA GOT SAVED BY THE COORDINATION OF THE WHOLE REBELS TEAM I WOULD HAVE A LOVE A BITTER CONCLUSION
GOOD JOB BUT COLORED LIGHTSABER SHADOWS IF ITS SUPPOSE TO BE LIGHT COMING FROM THE SABERS THEN IT WOULD BE JUST A SOFT GLOW ON SNOW ALL AROUND THEM
I MADE THIS IN HOURS DURING A PROJECT OF SCHOOL I HAD TO MAKE AN BIT PICTURE AND I COULD CHOOSE WHATEVER I LIKED

PLEASE NOTE THAT I MYSELF AM NEVER GOOD AT DRAWING AND THAT THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME MAKING SOMETHING INTO BIT

I DO HOPE YOU QUITE LIKE IT IT'S NOT ENTIRELY FINISHED AS THE TREES NEED TO BE LARGER AND STARS WAY LESSER BUT I PANICKED XD
YOU MIGHT ENJOY R PIXELART

GOOD FIRST ATTEMPT I KNOW HOW LONG THEY CAN TAKE AND IT'S NOT EASY BOTH OF THEM LOOK CUTE
CAN YOU MAKE A BB BIT
NO IT ISN'T CANON

2 IT CAN MOVE BETWEEN SYSTEMS LIKE THE DEATH STARS THE REBEL BASE WAS ALSO IN A DIFFERENT SYSTEM
YEAH WOUND IN THE FORCE IS NOT CANON ANYMORE
AND YOUR SECOND PROBLEM THE STARKVILLE WASN'T IN THE SAME SYSTEM AS THE RESISTANCE BASE IT'S JUST SHIT WRITING THAT HAD EVERYONE SEE THE BEAM FROM ANYWHERE
THERE IS NO REAL EXPLANATION FOR IT
EVERY PERSON THAT WAS FORCE SENSITIVE TO A DECENT DEGREE WOULD HAVE FELT THIS ACCORDING TO THE DEFINITION OF WOUND IN THE FORCE

HELLO HAPPY LUKE TRAINING WITH A LIGHTSABER WHILE GOES BREATHLESS AFTER ALDERMAN GOES GAGA
THAT A REALLY GOOD THOUGHT THE PHANTOM ENERGY WOULD HAVE TO BE FIRED USING A STAR WITHOUT A SYSTEM WITH LIFE IF THEY EVEN CARED ABOUT THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE WHICH MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE YES IT WOULD FLASH FREEZE EVERY PLANET IN THE SYSTEM THEY USED IT IN
YOU'RE QUESTIONING THE PHYSICS OF THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE YET YOU DON'T MENTION LIGHTNING SHOOTING FROM FINGERTIPS OR TELEKINESIS OR SUGGESTIVE THOUGHT COME NOW
NAH WHEN THE DUDE IN ANH WAS LIKE WHY AREN'T YOU AT YOUR POST THEN LUKE COMES OUT ACTING ALL HUMAN LIKE AND NOBODY SAYS ANYTHING IT WAS CLEAR THEN THEY WERE PEOPLE INSIDE

I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE AT LEAST PART ROBOT AND THE FILM GIVES NO DEFINITE ANSWER
YEARS OLD AND I SAW ALL THREE ORIGINALS IN THE THEATER AT RELEASE IT WAS VERY AMBIGUOUS AND MYSTERIOUS WHAT THE STORM-TROOPER AND DARTH VADER WERE AT TIMES YOU THOUGHT THEM ROBOTS ANDROIDS OR SOMETHING
NOPE IN THE RECENT JJ ABRAMS COMMENTARY FOR FORCE AWAKENS HE MENTIONS HE THOUGHT THEY WERE ROBOTS AS A KID AS WELL
LOTS OF KIDS DID IT WAS KINDA THE POINT OF DEHUMANIZING THEM WITH ARMOUR I AM PRETTY SURE I THOUGHT THEY WERE ROBOTS TOO ALTHOUGH I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER HOW PERSISTENT I WAS ON THAT
I THOUGHT SO TOO IT'S NICE TO SEE THEM HUMANIZED THAT'S WHY I LIKED FINN SO MUCH
I THOUGHT THEY WERE ROBOTS WHEN LUKE PUT ON THE UNIFORM I WONDERED WHERE ALL THE WIRES WENT TO SAW IT IN THE THEATRE FIRST RUN I AM OLD
IN THE BIBLE NAHUM WHEN ANH CAME OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT VADER AND THE STORM-TROOPER WERE ROBOTS BECAUSE OF THE ARMOR
NOT AT ALL I REMEMBER WATCHING ANH FOR THE FIRST TIME ON TV I THINK I WAS ABOUT EIGHT AT THE TIME AND HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH MY DAD ABOUT THEM THEY BEING WHITE ONES STORM-TROOPER AND THE GOLD ONE YOU-KNOW-WHO AND DAD EXPLAINING TO ME THAT THEY WERE ALL PEOPLE IN COSTUMES BUT ONLY THE GOLD ONE WAS MEANT TO BE A ROBOT

AND TYPING THAT MADE ME WISH I HAD A TIME MACHINE
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE SHORT TO BE A STORM-TROOPER ROBOT

HOW COULD THEY HAVE GOTTEN THE ARMOR DISGUISES IF THEY WERE ROBOTS

THIS IS WEIRD TO ME BECAUSE IT NEVER CROSSED MY MIND THAT THEY WERE ANYTHING BUT PEOPLE IN THERE EVEN AS A KID
PROBABLY I MEAN THE WHOLE LUKE AND HAN WEARING STORM TROOPER OUTFITS ISN'T THAT A DEAD GIVEAWAY
THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW A STAR WARS FILM WAS EMPIRE ON VHS IN THE EARLY SOUTH I ALSO ASSUMED THEY WERE ROBOTS SINCE YOU NEVER HEARD THEM SPEAK IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO SEE ANH MONTHS LATER AND THEY SPEAK THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE FILM
AND I THOUGHT THAT IT SAID OIL ON THEIR BACKS TOO
CYBORGS MAYBE


NOT ROBOTS
I THOUGHT BOBA FETT WAS A ROBOT
YES YES YOU WERE
I DID EARLY ON IN THE MOVIE I WAS SIX WHEN I FIRST SAW THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY WAAAAAY BACK IN AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT A SKELETON LOOKED LIKE AT THE TIME LIKE I KNEW BASED ON THE STEREOTYPICAL IMAGERY SHOWN TO KIDS BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A REALISTIC ONE LOOKED LIKE SO WHEN THEY GOT TO THE SCENE WHERE LUKE RETURNS TO FIND THE SMOULDERING BODIES OF HIS AUNT AND UNCLE I JUST ASSUMED EVERYONE WAS ROBOTS MY DAD IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED ME BUT I CAN REMEMBER THINKING AFTER THAT WOW ONLY ROBOTS COULD DO SOMETHING SO AWFUL TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REAL PEOPLE OF COURSE BY THE END OF THE MOVIE I HAD CHANGED MY MIND BECAUSE ROBOTS COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE SO STUPID AND HAVE SUCH TERRIBLE AIM

WELL THAT AND THE FACT THAT HAN AND LUKE STEALING THEIR ARMOR WOULD MAKE NO SENSE IF THEY WERE ROBOTS
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK VADER WAS ROBOTIC UNTIL THE 2ND FILM I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A COOL COSTUME

IF THEY WERE ROBOTS WHY ARE THE HELMETS EMPTY FOR PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR HEADS IN IT I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW THEY CAN BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN DUDES IN ARMOR


NAH I THOUGHT THEY WERE ROBOTS WHEN I WAS YOUNG TOO
NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY PEOPLE THOUGHT SO MAYBE FOR FIRST FEW MINUTES BUT LATER IN THE MOVIE NOPE IT'S NEVER STRAIGHT UP TOLD BUT JUST THE FACT THAT LUKE AND HAN DISGUISED AS STORM-TROOPER SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PROCESS IT PROPERLY

I WAS WHAT YEARS OLD WHEN I FIRST SAW ANH I DON'T RECALL EVER THINKING OF STORM-TROOPER AS ROBOTS DROIDS
I DID IN THE OPENING SCENE ON TACTIVE IV BEFORE ANY LINES WERE SPOKEN MY THOUGHTS WERE THE WHITE ROBOTS ARE THE BAD GUYS AND THE BLACK ROBOT IS THEIR BOSS I EVENTUALLY FIGURED IT OUT BUT I DON'T KNOW AT WHAT POINT PROBABLY WHEN THEY SAID LOOK SIR DROIDS
YEP TOTALLY PRETTY SURE I THOUGHT DARTH VADER WAS TOO
MAYBE IN THE OROLOGY BUT NOT IN THE TRILOGY

I KNEW THEY WERE HUMANS BECAUSE IF THEY WERE ROBOTS HAN AND LUKE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET IN THEIR ARMOR
THAT'S ABIA A FANTASTIC LOUISIANA BEER
HERE'S WHAT THE CHEWBACCA COSTUME FOR EPISODE III LOOKED LIKE WITHOUT HAIR



OR AT LEAST I THINK IT'S THE CHEWBACCA ONE COULD JUST BE ONE OF THE OTHER WOOKIEE COSTUMES THEY BUILT
THIS IS AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE'S IDEA OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE
LIKE LUCAS WITHOUT BEARD FUCKING WEIRD
DDK WHY DON'T YOU FIND ONE AND SHAVE IT AND REPORT BACK TO US
WHAT CAN YOU GET A WOOKIEE FOR CHRISTMAS WHEN HE ALREADY OWNS A COMB

SOMEONE PLEASE GET THAT
WAS THIS PAINTED BY BOBA ROSS
HAPPY LITTLE WAVES
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT THAT'S THE FALCON
WHICH TERMINAL IS THIS TOTALLY ASKING FOR A FRIEND AND NOT FOR ME WHO LIVES GATWICK AHEM
AND I THOUGHT THE ORIGINAL IMAGE HAD TOO MANY REPEATED STORM-TROOPER
DAMMIT I WAS JUST THERE FOR A TRIP AND IT WAS JUST THE CRAPPY EASYJET ADVERTS EVERYWHERE
TOO BAD IT IS STILL A TERRIBLE AIRPORT THE IMPERIAL OPPRESSION REALLY ADDS TO THE MOOD IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
RAD I LIVE ABOUT MILES DOWN THE ROAD FROM GATWICK SO I'LL POP UP TO CHECK IT OUT SOON
THATS COOL
THE SUNS NEVER SET ON THE GALACTIC EMPIRE
HAIL CORPORATE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE SUITABLE
HE HAS A BOBA
I GIVE UP WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY ABOUT THIS
HE SURE LIKES TO PROMINENTLY DISPLAY HIS INTERESTS DOESN'T HE
UM BLACK SHIRT
SPEAK IN BINARY YOU COULD UNDERSTAND THAT STUFF IF YOU KNOW IT
IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER LANGUAGE IT CAN BE LEARNED
WELL I DON'T THINK PEOPLE IN THE MOVIES REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT DROIDS WERE SAYING EXCEPT FOR THREEPING THEY JUST ENDED UP INTERPRETING SOUNDS AND TONES AFTER SO MUCH EXPOSURE AND CONTACT KIND OF LIKE WHEN A MO FA CHER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BABY WANTS AFTER HAVING LEARNED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE SOUNDS
IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WERE COMPUTERS TRANSLATING LIKE AFTER THE BATTLE OF HOTH IN WHEN HE HAS A CONVERSATION WITH ARTOU
VERY CAREFULLY

DROIDS SPEAK IN BINARY GENERALLY AND SENTIENTS CAN LEARN IT SOME DROIDS HAVE DIFFERENT ACCENTS THOUGH LIKE HOW BB AND SOUND DIFFERENT BUT THEY ARE BOTH UNDERSTANDABLE
SAME WAY FRENCH PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND BRITS OR AMERICANS GERMANS IT'S A LANGUAGE YOU CAN LEARN IT I COULD IMAGINE HUMANS GROWING UP IN BINARY ALTHOUGH THOSE WOULD BE SOME CRUEL PARENTS
EVEN THOUGH THEY REFER TO IT AS BINARY IT'S CLEARLY NOT ARTICULATED THAT WAY BY THE DROIDS

HONESTLY IT DOESN'T SOUNDS TOO DISSIMILAR TO MORSE CODE WHICH IS JUST A SERIES OF TAPS IF SOMEONE CAN LEARN MORSE CODE IT CAN'T BE TOO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO LEARN A LANGUAGE BASED ON TONAL BEEPS I WOULDN'T THINK
YEAH DROIDS ARE MUCH LIKE DOGS AND CATS IN THE SW UNIVERSE YOU LEARN THEIR PERSONALITIES AND IT BECOMES EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND COMMUNICATE
THANKS FOR TELLING
JIMMY FALLON
GONNA TOUSLE HER HAIR AND LAUGH WITH HER AWESOME
WE'RE WORKING ON A DUB OF A NEW HOPE USING CHINGLISH SUBTITLES I GENERATED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO BACKSTROKE OF THE WESTERN THIS IS THE OPENING CRAWL WHICH WAS DESIGNED IN CHINESE BY U BUREIKA AND THEN BACK TO ENGLISH BY ME
IF YOU'D LIKE TO A CHARACTER IN OUR DUB OR GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT PLEASE HEAD OVER TO R THEDUBGATHERS

MILKY WAY EMPEROR EVIL
ATTENTION REBEL ARMY SPY MANAGEMENT

SUBJECT RE USE OF CLOTHING STATION WAGON IN THEFT OF EMPIRE DEATH STAR

SERIOUSLY WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA IT'S BARELY BIG ENOUGH TO EAT ALL STAR

REGARDS MANAGEMENT
SO YOU ARE INTENTIONALLY MISINTERPRETING IT INTO CHINESE FROM ENGLISH BY SOMEONE WHO IS AND THEN TAKING THOSE MISTRANSLATED AND PUTTING THEM INTO ENGLISH BY A MACHINE CORRECT
THERE ARE CERTAIN WEBSITES THAT ALLOW YOU TO MAKE YOUR OWN TITLE CRAWL
AND ONLY DAYS UNTIL EPISODE VIII
THAT ALSO MEANS IT'S LIKE DAYS UNTIL I HAVE FINAL EXAMS SO I AM BOTH INSANELY EXCITED AND DREADING IT WHICH IS A STRANGE FEELING
OH MAN I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THIS MORE THAN CHRISTMAS LUCKILY FOR ME WHO HAS THE PRIVILEGE TO LIVE IN SWEDEN ONLY HAVE MORE DAYS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING VADER AGAIN AND HIS LIGHTSABER THE MOST I'M ALSO SUPER CURIOUS TO SEE HOW IT ENDS THOUGH I DON'T EVER WANT A STAR WARS MOVIE TO END
BOOKED MY TICKET FOR THE FIRST MIDNIGHT SHOWING LAST NIGHT NOW I JUST HAVE TO KEEP DODGING SPOILERS
DAYS FOR NORWAY
THATS ACTUALLY A PRETTY COOL IDEA GREAT WORK
IS THERE ANYWAY THIS IS ACTUALLY LEGAL YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT THE RIGHTS TO EVERYTHING YOU'RE SHOWING
NICE SEEMS PRETTY COOL TO BE HONEST
IT'S LIKE TOONAMI AFTERMATH IN A SENSE GREAT IDEA
AN IDEA I HAD HAVE PEOPLE ALSO LIVE STREAM STAR WARS VIDEO GAMES SINCE I'M THERE ARE A LOT OF VINTAGE SW GAMES I HAVEN'T THE PRIVILEGE TO PLAY MYSELF AND WOULD TO LOVE TO SEE SOMEONE COMMENT ON THEM AND PLAY LIVE
DO WE KNOW HOW MANY HOURS OF MOVIES AND TV THERE IS FOR STARWARD
PROBABLY NOT AS TO NOT CANNIBALIZE THEIR OWN ROGUE ONE HYPE
NOPE NOT WITH ROGUE ONE COMING OUT SOON IT'LL LIKELY BE AT CELEBRATION IN APRIL
YEAH THIS YEAR WILL SET THE PRECEDENT FOR THE SW REVEALS GOING FORWARD RATHER THAN LAST YEAR WHEN FFA WAS THE ONLY THING ON THE HORIZON I WOULDN'T EXPECT VIII NEWS UNTIL NEXT YEAR
NO BECAUSE ROGUE ONE IS COMING OUT CELEBRATION IS A FEW MONTHS AWAY AND THE FORCE AWAKENS REQUIRES A DIFFERENT MARKETING CAMPAIGN THEN VIII
WOULDN'T COUNT AGAINST A TITLE REVEAL AND VEEEERY SMALL TEASER LIKE JUST A LANDSCAPE SHOT OR TWO A LITTLE VOICEOVER AND MAYBE A SILHOUETTE SHOT OF REY AND LUKE AROUND THE ROGUE ONE RELEASE OR JUST AFTER
DID SOMEONE PUT THIS ON VHS AND UPLOAD AS
I LOVE HOW THE WALKER LOOKS BACK AT THEM AFTER GETTING HIT LIKE SERIOUSLY THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT
DON'T TRUST YOUR COMPUTER



THAT POTATO QUALITY THOUGH
I SURE HOPE THEY SUCCEED IN STEALING THE PLANS
IT'S NOT THE FINAL TRAILER JUST AN ABC PROMO I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE COULD FALL FOR THAT
I WILL NOT FAIL
ALREADY STEALING THE SHOW FOR ME
GUYS DON'T WATCH IF YOU DON'T WANT A COUPLE OF INDIVIDUAL JOKES SCENES SPOILED
ANYONE ELSE HOPING TO SEE BIGGS PERKINS WEDGE AND THE REST FOR RED SQUADRON MAKE AN APPEARANCE
I PERSONALLY CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE BEN MENDELSOHN HOPE HE GETS A KILLER MONOLOGS OR SOMETHING


I LIKED THAT THEY USED THE SAME MECHANICAL SOUNDS FOR THE WALKER AS THEY DID IN ESB

EDIT THE SOUND THE WALKER MAKES AS IT TURNS TO LOOK BACK AFTER THE ROCKET HIT
I OFFICIALLY CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE
ALL OF THE TRAILERS I HAVE SEEN FOR ROGUE ONE REALLY CAPTURE THE STAR WARS FEEL THAT I FOUND THE FORCE AWAKENS MISSING BUT THEN AGAIN THE TRAILERS FOR THE FORCE AWAKENS HAD MUCH MORE OF A THROWBACK STAR WARS FEEL THAN THE MOVIE ULTIMATELY DID IN MY OPINION
I LIKED THE OTHER TRAILERS BUT I'M NOT A FAN OF THIS ONE IT LOOKS LIKE A SHITTY ACTION MOVIE TOO MUCH
CONTINUING MY TREND OF GETTING TEARY WHEN THE SHOW UP OUT OF NOWHERE
THE POWAN THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE
I LIKE JENS DELIVERY OF MAY THE FORCE BE WITH US ON THIS MORE THAN ON THE SIZZLE REEL
OFFICIAL VERSION FROM THE STAR WARS YOUTUBE CHANNEL IN ACTUAL HD AND NOT POTATO QUALITY
NOT SURE IF PUNCH IT IS MEANT TO BE A SHOUT OUT OR TAKEN AS A COMMON EXPRESSION OF THE DAY IN THAT ERA
I KNOW THIS ISN'T A POPULAR OPINION BUT DAMN THIS DOESN'T EVEN FEEL LIKE STAR WARS IT FEELS LIKE A GENERAL SCI-FI ACTION FILM WITH STAR WARS CHARACTERS
THIS IS A BIT NITPICKY I'M SADDENED THAT THEY DUBBED HER MAY THE FORCE BE WITH US IT SOUNDED MORE HOPEFUL IN THE DEVELOPMENT FEATURETTE
MY CIRCUITS ARE WITH ANTICIPATION OF WHAT YOUR NEXT TASK WILL BE FOR ME THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE ENDING THE LIFE OF AN ORGANIC MEATBALL THAT DESERVES DEATH
ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN GET THE MUSIC FROM THIS TRAILER
I REALLY HOPE THIS ENDS WITH THE REBELS UPLOADING THE DEATH STAR PLANS THEN IMMEDIATELY GETTING SLAUGHTERED BY VADER
I GOTTA SAY SEEING THE DAMAGE THE MAKES ME THINK THAT THESE ARE AN OLDER MODEL OF WALKERS AND IN THE YEARS UP TO ESB THEY MADE THEM IMPERVIOUS TO BLASTER FIRE COULD ALSO BE THAT HAVE MORE POWERFUL BLASTERS THAN SNOWSPEEDERS I COULD BE WRONG BUT THAT'S MY OBSERVATION
I LOVE SEEING AN TAKE ON AN
I DETECT WEAK SAUCE
IS ANYONE ELSE UPSET ABOUT HOW BORING AND GENERIC THE MAIN CHARACTER IS
THEY COMPLETELY BLEW IT WITH THE MUSIC
AND THE FINAL CEMENT

IS LIKE A TRAILER FOR PEOPLE THAT DONT KNOW STAR WARS OR ALIENS NEW TO OUR PLANET

IS LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER GENERIC MOVIE TRAILER WHY DISNEY WHY
IF THAT WAS THE ONLY TRAILER I HAD SEEN UP TO THIS POINT I WOULD NOT BE SEEING THIS MOVIE THAT WAS AWFUL
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES THIS MUSIC HAVE THE SAME EXACT STRING SECTION AS THE THOR THEME
T
DO WE KNOW WHEN TICKETS WILL GO ON SALE YET LAST YEAR I WAS ABLE TO BUY THEM IN OCTOBER BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THIS YEAR
THE QUALITY OF THAT WAS UTTER PISH
MAN SEEING THAT DIVE IN AND TAKE-OUT THAT OUT OF NOWHERE IN THEATERS BEEN GREAT
SHIT WHEN THOSE SHOWED UP AFTER THE FAILED RPG
SERIOUSLY GUYS THIS IS THE LAST TRAILER I PROMISE GARETH EDWARDS
ANYONE ELSE GETTING A PROXY HK VIBE OUT OF THE IMPERIAL DROID
IF THERE WAS ANY STAR WARS FILM THAT SHOULD BE SERIOUS AND NOT HAVE GAGS AND JOKES EVERY FIVE MINUTES IT'S GOTTA BE THIS SUICIDE MISSION PLEASE LET THE FILM BE MORE DRAMATIC AND SERIOUS INSTEAD OF THE MODERN ACTION SCENE JOKES ACTION SCENE JOKES ACTION SCENE JOKES FORMULA
DO NOT WATCH THIS REALLY BAD QUALITY
OR IF YOU WANT THE OFFICIAL VERSION THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS FILMED ON A SHITTY VHS CAMCORDER

YWNVDORNNV
OH BOY THAT SIGNATURE ABC SOUND MIXING THAT SOUNDS LIKE SHIT
I FEEL LIKE EACH TRAILER HAS ME LESS AND LESS EXCITED FOR THIS FILM
AMAZING HOW MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TRAILER AND A COMMERCIAL
THIS WILL NOT BE POPULAR BUT THIS JUST DOESN'T LOOK THAT GREAT TO ME I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET EXCITED FOR IT SINCE ANNOUNCEMENT AND I CAN'T I THINK IT LOOKS WEIRD THE LINE READS ARE TERRIBLE I MEAN THEY ARE ATROCIOUS TAKE HOLD OF THIS MOMENT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD HEAR OUT OF AN AWFUL FAN FICTION DITTO FOR LITERALLY EVERY LINE I'VE HEARD OUT OF THE MAIN CHARACTER ERGO IF I'M SPELLING THAT RIGHT

HONESTLY THE ONLY GOOD PARTS SEEM TO BE THE CINEMATOGRAPHY EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T REMIND ME OF STAR WARS AT ALL AND THE ROBOT BECAUSE HE CHANNELS BITS OF A MUCH MILDER HK

I DEFINITELY WON'T BE SEEING IT IN A THEATRE WHICH IS ODD SINCE FFA WAS THE FIRST THING I SAW IN A THEATRE FOR YEARS
I FEEL LIKE I'VE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE NOW
DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK THAT DIEGO LINES ALL SEEM OVERDUBBED AND OUT OF SYNC IN THIS AND ALL PREVIOUS TRAILERS WHAT'S UP WITH THAT
WHY IS EACH NEW ROGUE ONE TRAILER PROGRESSIVELY WORSE THAN THE ONE THAT CAME BEFORE IT THE FIRST ONE HAD ME QUITE EXCITED
I HATE WHEN THEY SAY MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU THIS IS DURING A TIME PERIOD WHERE THE FORCE WASN'T KNOWN
WHAT AN AWFUL TRAILER TOTALLY NOT STAR WARS THE POTATO QUALITY DOESN'T HELP EITHER
DISPLAYS LIKE THAT MAKE YOU WONDER WHY THE REBELS EVEN FEARED THE EMPIRE EVEN IN OLD CANON WOULD WRECK WALKERS
I'LL PROBABLY WATCH THIS
I WONDER IF PALATINE WILL BE IN IT
THEY CALL IT THE DEATH STAR ISN'T THAT ONLY WHAT THE REBELLION CALLED IT REBEL PROPAGANDA OR ARE THEY CHANGING THAT NOW
HOW SPOILER IS THIS TRAILER SINCE BAS I'VE BEEN SUPER CAUTIOUS ABOUT ANYTHING PAST THE FIRST TRAILER SINCE EACH ONE GRADUALLY GIVES AWAY MORE AND MORE OF THE PLOT
WATCH IT WITH CAPTIONS ON
SEEMS THAT I'M GONNA DIE WITHOUT THE CHANCE OF WATCH A MOVIE ABOUT KYLE KATAR
I THOUGHT I SAW HUGH LAURIE AT FIRST
SO CLOSE
THE MUSIC GIVE ANYONE ELSE CHILLS I'LL MISS JOHN WILLIAMS BUT DAMN THAT SOUNDED AMAZING
WHY IS THE PICTURE QUALITY SO POOR
YEP STILL GET CHILLS LIKE I'M YEARS OLD I'M READY FOR THIS
REBELS VS WALKERS IN ROGUE ONE REBELS VS WALKERS IN EMPIRE
I DONT THINK THIS MOVIE NEEDED ANOTHER TRAILER TSH
STILL GOTTA LISTEN TO THE PREQUEL BOOK BUT I STILL GOTTA FINISH THE ASHOK BOOK WHAT TO DODO
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS MOVIE MORE THAN I WAS ABOUT FORCE AWAKENS

HOWEVER THIS TRAILER IS THE WORSE ONE THEY HAVE RELEASED
I FEEL REALLY EMOTIONAL EVERY TIME I SEE A STAR WARS TRAILER
I'M SO MUCH MORE PSYCHED FOR THIS ONE THAN I WAS FOR EPISODE VII THIS IS THE STAR WARS PREQUEL I WANTED WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD OR SO
SAME BULLSHIT WITH THIS SOUNDTRACK AS IN EVERY MODERN FILM TRACK PAINFUL IRRITATING OSTINATO SAME FOUR CHORDS ALL THE WAY THROUGH DESTROYING AND REGURGITATING JOHN WILLIAMS MUSIC ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF COUNTERPOINT OR MUSICAL SENSE AT ALL

DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE PAINFULLY CLICHE ORCHESTRATION NOT A HINT OF WOODWIND OR ANYTHING INTERESTING BLOATED HORNS AND BRASS SECTION AFRICAN DRUM PERCUSSION WITH REVERB LIKE IT WAS RECORDED IN A QUARRY AND SCREECHING

THIS SHIT IS OBVIOUSLY THE WORK OF SOMEONE SITTING AT A COMPUTER ALL DAY MESSING WITH A KEYBOARD UNTIL THEY GET SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS GOOD

SINGLE HANDEDLY DESTROYING THE EPIC LEGACY OF JOHN WILLIAMS AND CAUSING THE FILM MUSIC INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE ITS FREE FALL FROM EXCELLENCE WHERE THERE IS NO LONGER A PREMIUM ON SKILL AND ARTISTIC EXPRESSION IN MUSIC

FUCKING HELL
EDIT THIS MUSIC IS FASCIST IN EVERY SENSE NO ROOM FOR THE LISTENER TO HAVE THIER OWN THOUGHTS OR EXPRESSIVE BUT FORCING ITS IDEOLOGY ON THE AUDIENCE YOU SHOULD FEEL EXCITED RIGHT NOW TO LISTEN YOU HAVE TO CONFORM
QUESTION IS THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE GOING TO HAVE AN OPENING TEXT SCRAWL
I STILL THINK ITS ODD THAT DISNEY HASNT RELEASED AN IDIOT PROOF TRAILER FOR THIS THERE IS STILL WAY TOO MUCH CONFUSION AMONGST THE GENERAL AUDIENCES ABOUT WHAT WHEN WHERE THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT THEY NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE BEFORE REY BEFORE LUKE SKYWALKER SEE THE HEROES WHO LAUNCHED THE REBELLION AND TOOK DOWN THE FIRST DEATH STAR SEE DARTH VADER IN HIS PRIME YES THIS IS TECHNICALLY ANOTHER PREQUEL BUT THIS ONE IS GONNA BE GOOD WE SWEAR
DON'T YOU FIND IT KINDA WEIRD HOW MUCH THEY TALK ABOUT THE FORCE IN THE FIRST STAR WARS MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT
TO THE RESCUE
ROGUE ONE FEVER IS ON CHECK THIS INSANE LIFE SIZE REPLICA
THIS IS THE STAR WARS MOVIE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
IS IT ME OR THE LOOK LIKE GODZILLA
THE CLOSER WE GET TO ROGUE ONE THE SALTIER I GET THAT THEY MANAGED TO GET DONNIE YEN MADE HIM A FORCE USER YET DIDN'T GIVE HIM A LIGHTSABER

I KNOW IT WOULD HAVE RUINED THE WHOLE NO JEDI LEFT THING BUT COCOON DONNIE YEN WITH A LIGHTSABER
I FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN THE WHOLE MOVIE NOW
PUNCH IT MAKES ME HARD EVERYTIME
WHEN THE FUCK ARE PRESALE TICKETS GOING TO BE OFFERED
IN THE BEGINNING IT FELT LIKE I WAS ABOUT TO WATCH AN EPISODE OF THE FLASH
AWING VS ATAT COOOOOL
WHY DOES EVERYTHING LOOK SO GRAY LIKE CEMENT
WHAT IS THIS SOME KIND OF DEATH STAR OR SOMETHING
WHY DO WE NEED SO MANY TRAILERS
WELL I JUST SHIT MY PANTS AGAIN
I HOPE NO BETHANKS WERE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THIS MOVIE
THE LOOK LIKE SHIT THE PROPORTIONS ARE TOTALLY OFFICIAL THE LEGS ARE WAY TOO LONG AND THIN
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BLOW FORCE AWAKENS OUT OF ORBIT
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THIS MOVIE ON THIS SUB
OH GOD THE MAIN ACTRESS IS SO CRINGE EVERYTHING ELSE IS FINE
I MIGHT BE MISREMEMBERING SO CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG

IN A NEW HOPE WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE PLANS OF THE DEATH STAR DOESN'T ONE OF THE REBEL LEADERS SAY SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF MANY DIED GETTING US THIS INFORMATION

SO FROM WATCHING THE TRAILERS I KEEP WONDERING WHY THERE AREN'T ANY BETHANKS SHOWN IN ANY OF THE CLIPS

AM I WRONG AND THAT WASN'T WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT THE DEATH STAR PLANS OR ARE THERE BETHANKS SHOWN IN THE TRAILER AND I'M JUST NOT SEEING THEM

EDIT I'M THINKING OF THE WRONG DEATH STAR THE MANY BETHANKS DIED THING CAME FROM ROTC
THIS IS LOOKING GOOD BUT I ADMIT I DO HOPE IT'S AN ALMOST TOTAL PARTY KILL FOR THE ROGUE ONE GROUP TO GET THE PLANS FOR THE DEATH STAR AFTER ALL WHY SHOULD A BANCHA HUMANS BE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN THE BETHANKS
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRAWS OF THIS MOVIE WILL BE FELICITY JONES PANTS
I WANT BEN MENDELSOHN AS EVERY BAD GUY EVER FROM NOW ON GOD DAMN THIS LOOKS BETTER THAN EPISODE
THE CHIRRUP AND BAZE BROTHERHOOD IS GONNA BE THE BEST PART OF THIS MOVIE
WHY WOULD YOU UPLOAD THIS POTATO QUALITY AND WHY WOULD YOU GUYS UNVOTE THIS TO DOWNVOTE INTO OBLIVION PLS
DELETED
WHERE'S THE BETHANKS
SATINE DIED EVEN THE MOST BASIC RESEARCH DISPROVES YOUR THEORY
THIS WON'T HAPPEN SIMPLY BECAUSE OF PEOPLE WHO SEE THE FILM WON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT SATINE OR KNOW WHO SHE IS AND THEY WOULD SOMEHOW HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS IN A FILM
THIS SEEMS LOGICAL
LAURA DERN COULD BE A MUCH OLDER SABINE WREN
THE FACE MAKES THIS HORRIFYING
NIGHTMARE FUEL
WELP I'M AWAKE NOW
DFW YOU'RE NOT SURE IF THEY'RE COUSINS SO YOU CAN'T BE COOL WITH THE ALMOST KISS
REYNO IS LIFE

SERIOUSLY THIS IS BEAUTIFUL LOVE THE COLORS
SOURCE

I WAS GOING TO POST ANOTHER ONE OF HIS HERS BUT THEN I SAW THIS
COOL ART JUST NOT DIGGING THE REYNO PORTION
LOVELY PIECE I'M ALSO NOT SURE OF THE REYNO THEORY BUT THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
I'M HOT FOR TEACHER
I HAD THIS STRANGE THOUGHT OF REY ASKING WHAT'S YOUR ACCREDITATION
YEAH FAIR ENOUGH I JUST LIKED THE COLOR
THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK TRAILER REMINDS ME OF THE OPENING CLIPS FROM THE CLONE WARS

MPH I'M FINE WITH A NEW FILM EVERY YEAR AS LONG AS THEY'RE GOOD HOW WOULD I GET FATIGUED
AS GOOD AN IDEA AS IT IS THEY'RE NOT GONNA PASS OFF AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY I DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING
I'M THEY CAN TAKE A BREAK AFTER I'M DEAD
A BREAK AFTER THE SKYWALKER SAGA WRAPS UP WOULD BE NICE BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN

THOUGH HEY IF THEY'RE GONNA PUSH OUT A THIRD ANTHOLOGY FLICK FOR IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE THE FLICK THAT BEEN SCREAMING FOR SINCE THE FIRST FILM AFTER THE SKYWALKER FILMS BEING ONE LAST FLASHBACK THAT UNITED THE PREQUEL AND THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY WOULD BE A FANTASTIC WAY TO WRAP UP THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF RELAUNCH OF STAR WARS AND WOULD CLEAR THE DECKS FOR PHASE II OF STAR WARS EFFORTS WITH A KOROR FILM OR WHATEVER THE HELL TANGENT THEY'LL END UP DEVELOPING
TO BE HONEST I HOPE THERE ARE EVENTUALLY TWO STAR WARS FILMS A YEAR LIKE MARVEL AS LONG AS THERE ARE A COUPLE OF YEARS BETWEEN SAGA FILMS THERE WON'T BE MUCH FATIGUE I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY THEY'RE FATIGUED AND THERE'S TOO MUCH BUT THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE THE VAST MINORITY JUST LIKE SOME COMPLAIN ABOUT OVER EXPOSURE OF MARVEL FILMS WE'RE GOING ON A DECADE OF MULTIPLE MARVEL FILMS A YEAR AND EVERY SINGLE ONE SMASHES THE BOX OFFICE
YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK AS FOR ME I'LL BE WATCHING WHATEVER IS RELEASED IN
I CAN NEVER GET TIRED OF YEARLY STAR WARS MOVIES
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA
I REALLY DON'T WANT STAR WARS TO BECOME LIKE MARVEL
MARVEL IS THE FAST FOOD OF MOVIES EASY TO CONSUME BUT JUST RUNS THROUGH YOUR BODY WITH NO SUBSTANCE

EPISODE X
JUST YOU WAIT THEY'RE RAMPING UP MARVEL MOVIES TO TIMES A YEAR STARTING THINK OF HOW MANY STAR WARS FILMS THEY CAN MAKE
I COMPLETELY AGREE AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE FACT THAT WE'RE GETTING SO MANY FILMS LUCASFILM NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO PACE THEMSELVES TO AVOID AUDIENCE FATIGUE AND TO BUILD UP PROPER HYPE TAKING BREAKS EVERY FEW YEARS WILL GIVE THEM MUCH MORE LONGEVITY IN THE END AND ALSO KEEP IT SPECIAL FOR THE FANS
I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM RELEASE THE NEW STAND ALONE FILM IN THEN NOT DO A FILM IN GIVE US SOME TIME BEFORE STARTING THE NEXT TRILOGY
IT WILL PROBABLY DEPEND ON THE BOX OFFICE RESULTS OF ROGUE ONE AND USUALLY SERIES TRILOGIES TANK IN THE MIDDLE EPISODES AS PEOPLE GENERALLY GO TO THE FIRST AND LAST FILMS EX PREQUEL TRILOGY IF RO BOMBS OUT OR DOESN'T DO SO HOT IT WILL PROBABLY TELL DISNEY TO SLOW IT DOWN TO TRY AND NOT FLOOD THE MARKET I KNOW MONEY IS TEMPTING BUT NOTHING DESTROYS A GOOD SERIES LIKE OVER FLOODING THE MARKET
NR S SHOW UP MORE THAN THE DO SO I PERSONALLY WOULDN'T ADD THEM TO THE LIST IT'S A SHAME WE NEVER SAW THEM IN FULL CIS COLORS BUT WE DON'T IN EPISODE III SO I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE MY PERSONAL BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN LACKING ACW VEHICLES IS THE SPIDER DROID THEY WERE FEATURED A LOT IN LEGENDS CONTENT AND THEY ALWAYS SEEMED MAKE SENSE TO ME IN A UNIVERSE FILLED WITH WALKERS WE DID GET THE OCTUPTARRA IN THE MOVIE SO MAYBE THEY WANTED TO USE THAT BUT WE ALSO SEE SPIDER DROIDS IN EPISODE III ON FELECIA
I LIKE THAT THEY INTRODUCED A LOT OF NEW STUFF AND DIDN'T JUST REHASH EXISTING CHARACTERS AND DESIGNS

I'M SURE THE HAILFIRE WAS USED A BIT ON ONE OF THOSE PINK PLANETS
I DID FIND IT A BIT WEIRD THAT SOME OF THE COMMON VEHICLES NEVER REALLY APPEARED BUT I SUPPOSE A LOT OF THE EPISODES DID FOCUS ON SMALLER STRIKE FORCES AND TEAMS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER BATTLES THOSE VEHICLES DID APPEAR IN I ASSUME

BUT I REALLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT A LOT OF THE JEDI CHARACTERS WENT UNDERUSED I THINK THERE WERE PLANS TO SHOW MORE OF THEM IN THE LATER SEASONS BEFORE THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED HOPPO RANCISIS AND COLEMAN KCAL HAD MODELS MADE AND ADDED LATER IN THE RUN RANCISIS EVEN HAD A UNIQUE LIGHTSABER HILT MODELED SO I ASSUME THEY PLANNED TO SHOW HIM FIGHTING AT SOME POINT AND POSSIBLY DYING OPENING HIS SEAT UP FOR ANAKIN LATER THE PRODUCERS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A MODEL FOR TASS ALLIE SO SHE COULD SHOW UP

IF THE SHOW HAD CONTINUED THEY ALSO WOULD HAVE REDONE THE BATTLE OF CORUSCANT AND GRIEVOUS SWOOPING IN TO TAKE PALATINE THE BATTLE THROUGH THE CITY WITH SHAAK TI AND GRIEVOUS IN THE VERSION WAS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE SERIES WHILE IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE SAME IT STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO SEE SHAAK TI GET IN ON THE ACTION SINCE SHE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BACKGROUND CHARACTERS MAYBE THEY COULD HAVE ADDED COLEMAN KCAL TO THE BATTLE AS WELL SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NO INFORMATION ON THE CHARACTER AND HE HAS NEVER SPOKEN IN ANY OF HIS APPEARANCES

I DO THINK THEY MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY EARLY ON IN ACW THOUGH WHEN THEY LET BEETH KOTH SURVIVE HIS ENCOUNTER WITH GRIEVOUS IN SEASON 2 IT WOULD HAVE ADDED A BIT MORE CREDIBILITY TO GRIEVOUS AS A VILLAIN IF HE DEFEATED AND KILLED KOTH EVEN IF WITH THE HELP OF HIS MAGNA GUARDS AND THEN THEY COULD HAVE ADDED AGEN KOLAR IN LATER BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO KOTH AND WHY KOLAR WAS IN HIS SEAT IN EPISODE III

ALSO I WISH AIN DIALLING HAD APPEARED MORE OFTEN AND HAD A BIGGER PART IN THE WRONG JEDI ARC I ALWAYS LIKED HIM AND SERA KETO AFTER HAVING PLAYED THE REVENGE OF THE SITH GAME
DURING A RECENT RECATCH MY BROTHER AND I LIKED TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TRANSPORT THE HEROES WERE GOING TO USE THIS TIME A PERSONAL FAVORITE WAS WHAT WE DUBBED THE HAPPY SHUTTLE THE FOR THE COCKPIT THAT APPEARED TO BE AN OVER EXAGGERATED SMILING FACE
I THINK I'M GOING TO ENJOY
I THINK THE STORM-TROOPER THREW THE N THERMAL DETONATOR STORED ON THE BACK OF HIS AMOR AT K THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN THAT
FIRST ON SCREEN USE OF A THERMAL DETONATOR
NICE AND FOR THE UNINITIATED
I LOVE HOW CASUALLY HE CAUGHT IT
COOL DROIDS DON'T LOOK AT EXPLOSIONS
JUST KINDA LETS IT ALL WASH OVER HIM
SO FAR THE THING THAT HAS ME MOST CONCERNED ABOUT ROGUE ONE IS THAT THE STORM-TROOPER LOOK SUPER INCOMPETENT EVEN BY STORM-TROOPER STANDARDS ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE SCARED OF DEATHTROOPERS AND SCARFS EVERY STORM-TROOPER WE'VE SEEN IN THE TRAILER IS JUST GETTING HUMILIATED ENTIRE SQUADS OR MORE ARE BEING DESTROYED BY STICKS OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW MANY TROOPERS GET KNOCKED OUT BY STICKS THEN ONE GUY WITH AN JUST ANNIHILATES ON HOW MANY NOW AT LEAST GET BLOWN UP BY A NO LOOK GRENADE TOSS A GRENADE SUPPLIED TO THE RESISTANCE BY ONE OF THEIR OWN AFTER WHAT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER WERE BEAT INTO SUBMISSION

IT'S LIKE THE STORM-TROOPER CORPS IS THE MILLION STOOGES
I HAVE SOME HORRIBLE FEELING THAT IS GOING TO GET A SPEAR THROUGH THE CHEST
WTF IS THAT ONE TROOPER DOING AT THE BEGINNING
THIS REMINDS ME OF THE SCENE IN FFA WHERE HAN POINTS AND SHOOTS A STORM TROOPER WITHOUT LOOKING DIDN'T LIKE THAT SCENE AND NOT A FAN OF THIS ONE EITHER
IS THIS FROM THE TRAILERS I DON'T REMEMBER THIS SCENE AND FROM THE QUALITY OF IT I WOULD THINK IT'S FROM A LEAKED VIDEO
I LOVE THE WAY IT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT HUMANS DROPPING THEIR BAGS THREATENING TO KILL THEM AND JUST WALKING AWAY WITH A DON'T GIVE A SHIT SCREW YOU MEAT BAGS ATTITUDE
SOMEONE'S GOING TO MAKE THIS INTO AN GIF SOON
IS IT JUST ME OR IS FELICITY EXPRESSION AND STANCE JUST ABOUT THE SEXIEST STRONGEST THING EVER
DO STORM TROOPER BLASTERS HAVE LIKE A FOOT RANGE DO THEY JUST NOT REALIZE YOU CAN SHOOT AT ENEMIES FROM A DISTANCE
OH I GET IT

RED RED
THOSE EYES HAVE SEEN PAIN GREAT JOB
THIS HITS ME IN THE FEELS AND MAKES ME THINK GREAT JOB
THIS IS REALLY GREAT TO JUST SHOW THE HUMAN INSIDE THE COLD SUIT AFTER KNOWING EVADERS BACKSTORY I DIDN'T HATE HIM I FELT SORRY FOR ANAKIN
THIS IS REALLY HAUNTING LOVE IT
UHFILAKSFHDAKJH LATHIS IS AWESOME
IN THE BOOK LARKIN COMMUNICATIONS ARE OFTEN ANALYZED IN DEPTH TO CHECK FOR IRREGULARITIES WHILE NOT QUITE PROGRAMMING TOUGH THERE IS DEFINITELY ROOM FOR COMPUTER MANIPULATION

AND THERE IS C3 PO WHO CAN SPEAK MANY LANGUAGES INCLUDING BACCI WHICH THE MOISTURE HARVESTERS RUN ON ANH SO I EXPECT THAT IF A DROID CAN DO IT THERE CERTAINLY MUST BE WIDE SPREAD PROGRAMMING IN THE GALAXY
I DON'T THINK SO AT LEAST NOT IN DEPTH THE CLOSEST THING THAT COMES TO MIND IS THE KOROR VIDEO GAME WHERE HACKING WAS CONSOLE COMMANDS AS IF THE CONSOLE WERE A DROID BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S JUST A GAME

WOULD BE COOL IF THERE WAS ANTHOLOGY ABOUT THE DUDE THAT CREATES AI IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE
HACKERS ARE CALLED SLICERS

THAT IS ABOUT IT

REMEMBER THIS IS STAR WARS NOT STAR TREK STAR WARS IS IS A SPACE OPERA OR SCIENCE FANTASY NOT SCI-FI RULES OF PHYSICS OT REALITY DO NOT APPLY
THE CONCEPT OF HACKING OR SLICING AS IT IS REFERRED TO IN STAR WARS IS EXPLORED A BIT ESPECIALLY IN THE OLD REPUBLIC ERA SIMILAR TO COMPUTERS TODAY BOTH ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION SEEMED TO HAVE PROGRESSED AT SIMILAR RATES ONE WAY SLICERS STAR WARS HACKERS COULD SLICE A COMPUTER IS BY INSERTING A DATA SPIKE INTO ANY PORT OF A DATA TERMINAL COMPUTER WHERE THE SPIKE WOULD RAPIDLY RUN A SET OF DECRYPTION ALGORITHMS WITH THE ALGORITHMS RUN DEPENDING ON THE DATA SPIKE THESE WERE USUALLY ONE TIME USE BECAUSE THEY WOULD SHORT OUT AFTER SLICING ONE TERMINAL DRAWBACK OF THIS METHOD OBVIOUSLY IS THAT THE SLICER HAS TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT AT THE TERMINAL PROBABLY USED A SIMILAR METHOD TO GAIN ACCESS TO VARIOUS SHIP CONTROLS ALTHOUGH DROID BRAINS OPERATED A BIT DIFFERENTLY
IN ASOKA AN INFLUENTIAL SENATOR HIDES THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE BURGEONING REBELLION BY WIPING ALL FILES AND COMMUNIQUES RELATED TO REBEL OPERATIONS FOR FEAR OF THE DIGITAL VERSIONS FALLING IN TO THE WRONG HANDS AND AN IMPERIAL CONSULTANT MAKES REFERENCE TO AN ALGORITHM HE'S WRITTEN FOR LOCATING RESOURCES FOR THE EMPIRE

NOT DIRECT REFERENCES TO CODE BUT IMPLICATIONS THAT CODING IS HAPPENING
HERE ARE A FEW MENTIONS OF PROGRAMMING I RECALL FROM BOOKS ALTHOUGH NEITHER ARE PARTICULARLY IN DEPTH

IN LORDS OF THE SITH MINOR SPOILERS S BALLON A MEMBER OF THE FREEDOM FIGHTERS IS DESCRIBED AS A GENIUS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HE REPROGRAMS DROID FIGHTERS TO FLY INDEPENDENT OF A DROID CONTROL SHIP IT IS MENTIONED A FEW TIMES THEY CANNOT STAND AGAINST ENEMY FIGHTERS AND THEY ARE USED AS DISTRACTIONS OR TO DELIVER PAYLOADS IN THE BOOK I DON'T RECALL ANY PROGRAMMING DETAILS GIVEN IN THE BOOK BUT THE MENTION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SUPPORTS YOUR THOUGHT THAT SW TECHNOLOGY WORKS SIMILAR TO OURS GOOGLE BOOKS LINK TO QUOTE

IN AFTERMATH CHARACTER DESCRIPTION S THE MODIFIED BATTLE DROID MISTER BONES IS SAID TO BE PRIMED WITH A HIGH-OCTANE COCKTAIL OF PROGRAMS SOME HEURISTIC COMBAT DROID PROGRAMS SOME MARTIAL ARTS AIDS THE MOVES OF SOME CLONE WARS CYBORG GENERAL AND ALSO THE MANEUVERS OF A TROUPE OF DANCERS FROM RYLOTH BONES WAS ASSEMBLED FROM SCAVENGED PARTS BY TEMIN BEXLEY HIS MECHANICAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE DESCRIBED A BIT IN THE BOOK HOWEVER I DON'T RECALL MUCH DETAIL GIVEN IN TERMS OF SOFTWARE THE CYBORG GENERAL IN THE QUOTE IS REFERRING TO GRIEVOUS WIKI LINKS TO MISTER BONES AND TEMIN BEXLEY
WIKI

EDIT JUST FINISHED HEIR TO THE JEDI AND THERE ARE QUITE A FEW CS REFERENCES THAT DEFINITELY SOUND SIMILAR TO OURS PLOT OVERVIEW S THE ALLIANCE IS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE A CRYPTOGRAPHIC GENIUS FROM THE EMPIRE TO CRACK IMPERIAL CODES THIS BOOK DEFINITELY HAS THE MOST PROGRAMMING REFERENCES OF THE THREE HERE AND HAS A LOT OF MATH TERMINOLOGY THROWN IN TOO
NOT IN DAPH I THINK
AND WHY SHOULD PROGRAMMING BE ANY DIFFERENT IT'S THE SAME UNIVERSE AS OURS

PLEASE DON'T GIVE HOT TOPIC ANY MORE BAD IDEAS
IS SHE WEARING A NECKTIE
SO IS DARTH GIRL MEANT TO BE READ AS THE NAME OF A SUPERHERO OR AS THE NAME OF A SITH LORD

BECAUSE WHILE THE FORMER IS KIND OF COOL THE LATTER IS REALLY DUMB
NO
MIGHT WANT TO TRY OUT A DEDICATED FORUM LIKE SIDESHOWCOLLECTORS REBELSCUM OR STATUEFORUMS
IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY EXHAUST PORTS EVERYONE ON BOARD WOULD DIE FROM ASPHYXIATION

SO DROID SHIP
I WOULD HAVE VERY PUBLICLY HOUSED THE FAMILIES OF EVERY CREW MEMBER ABOARD
I WOULD MAKE IT MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
I'D JUST SAY FUCK IT BUILD THE GALAXY GUN AND PARK IT SOMEWHERE IN THE OUTER RIM WHY BOTHER WITH CONSTANTLY MOVING AROUND A GIANT SPACE STATION THAT EXPOSES ITSELF WHEN IT ATTACKS WHEN YOU COULD JUST FIRE MISSILES THROUGH HYPERSPACE
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A GIANT LIGHTSABER IN SPACE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
RADICALLY IMPROVE COMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DROIDS FROM SIMPLY PLUGGING INTO A RANDOM DOCK TERMINAL AND GAINING ACCESS TO EVERYTHING ALL DOCKSIDE COMPUTERS WOULD OPERATE ON AN INDEPENDENT NETWORK COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM THE PRIMARY NETWORK FOR THE REST OF THE STATION THE ABILITY TO ACCESS STATION SCHEMATICS OR INFORMATION ON HIGH LEVEL PRISONERS WOULD BE RESTRICTED TO TERMINALS THAT ARE ON THE PRIMARY NETWORK AND WITH PROPER AUTHORIZATION

IMPROVE THE DEFENSES OF THE DEATH STAR BY INSTALLING CLOSE RANGE RAPID FIRE BLASTER CANNONS LONG RANGE FLAK BATTERIES AND CONCUSSION MISSILE LAUNCHER BATTERIES ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATION ALSO INSTALL SECONDARY SHIELD GENERATORS TO COVER THE SMALL GAPS IN THE PRIMARY SHIELDING THAT FIGHTERS COULD SNEAK THROUGH

THE TRACTOR BEAM CONTROL ASSEMBLY IS IN A SEALED ROOM GUARDED BY A SQUAD OF STORM-TROOPER AND REMOTELY MONITORED AT ALL TIMES RATHER THAN SIMPLY SITTING NEXT TO A WALKWAY WITHOUT ANY KIND OF SECURITY MONITORING

THE DETENTION BLOCKS GO ON AUTOMATIC LOCKDOWN WHEN WEAPON FIRE IS DETECTED THAT MEANS THAT ALL CELL DOORS ARE MAGNETICALLY SEALED AND CAN ONLY BE OPENED WITH THE PERSONAL AUTHORIZATION OF A COLONEL OR HIGHER THE SAME HAPPENS TO ALL GARBAGE COMPACTOR SHAFTS
DON'T BUILD IT I WOULD TAKE ALL THE MONEY AND MATERIEL AND USE THEM TO BUILD SEVERAL HUNDRED IF NOT THOUSAND STAR DESTROYERS THEY COULD INFLICT FAR MORE DAMAGE THAN ANY SUPER WEAPONS AND FOR A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT COST


I'VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN SOLDIERS WIN WARS NOT SUPERWEAPONS
MAKE IT MORE DEFENSIBLE AGAINST SMALL CRAFT LIKE MAYBE HAVE IMPORTANT AHEM ACCESSIBLE COMPONENTS TO THE STATION RAY SHIELDED MAKE IT CONSIDERABLY SMALLER I MEAN THAT SEEMED TO MAKE IT PRETTY DIFFICULT TO DEFEND AS IT'S A HUGE EXPOSED SPHERE AND ALSO IT SEEMED TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DO ANYTHING QUICKLY IT TOOK THEM A LIFE TIME TO GET WITHIN FIRING RANGE OF BAVIN IF IT WERE SMALLER IT WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO POSITION FASTER AND THE REBELS WOULD HAVE HAD LITTLE TIME TO EXECUTE ANYTHING AND THEN THEY WENT AND MADE IT BIGGER AND THEN HELL THEY WENT AND MADE ANOTHER SUPER WEAPON LITERALLY THE SIZE OF A PLANET I KNOW DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION BUT YOU STILL THINK THEY WOULD HAVE LEARNED AND THEY MADE IT EVEN EASIER INSTEAD OF A TWO FOOT WIDE WEAKNESS THEY HAD LIKE A TWO MILE WIDE WEAKNESS APOLOGIES FOR GETTING OFF TOPIC A LITTLE
I'D INSTALL BARS AND WHATEVER PROOF FORCE FIELDS FOR THOSE EXHAUST PORTS

THE REST OF THE DEATH STAR I'D HIRE SOME COMPUTER CAVY GUY AND ASSISTANT KEVIN FOR THE REALLY HARD PARTS AND STUFF I OVERLOOKED
I HAD THIS IDEA THAT YOU COULD BUILD A STARKVILLE BASE LIKE STRUCTURE INSIDE A GAS GIANT MAKING SOME KINDA FAKE METHANE HURRICANE LIKE THE GREAT RED SPOT ON JUPITER THE HOLE FOR THE LAZER TO GO THROUGH

IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY MASKED AS A GAS GIANT AND THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE WOULD BE BUILT AROUND THE GAS GIANTS CORE
I GOT IT

THE DEATH STAR COULD BE REBUILT LIKE A HUGE MOON ORBITING ANOTHER PLANET IT WOULD BE JUST AS POWERFUL AS STARKVILLE BASE AND UTILIZE A NEW ENERGY SOURCE THAT DID NOT REQUIRE DRAINING SUNS

LIKE STARKVILLE BASE IT WOULD BE DISGUISED AS A PLANETOID BUT MORE CONVINCING LIKE DISGUISE THE SUPERLAZER PART AS A CRATER SEA



YOU COULD ALSO MAKE THE DEATH STAR A LARGE STARKVILLE BASE LIKE SPACE STATION BUILT INSIDE A GAS GIANT A METHANE STORM ON THE GAS GIANT SIMILAR TO JUPITER GREAT RED SPOT COULD SERVE AS THE EXIT FOR THE LAZER



AND LASTLY THE DEATH STAR COULD BE A HUGE DYSON SPHERE LIKE CONSTRUCT IT WOULD APPEAR AS A CORUSCANT LIKE ECUMENOPOLIS AND BE COVERED IN POWERFUL DEFENSES WITH MULTIPLE EXHAUST PORTS THAT ARE WELL PROTECTED

IT WOULD BE JUST AS POWERFUL IF NOT MORE POWERFUL THAN THE STARKVILLE BASE DEPENDING ON WHAT STAR IT WAS BUILT AROUND

IT COULD ALSO HAVE AN IMPERIAL PALACE ON IT FOR EMPEROR PALATINE



IT COULD BE LIKE A BIG CUBE THAT FLOATS THROUGH SPACE AND THEY TAKE PEOPLE TO BE ONE OF THEM IF THEY CATCH YOU
POP UP WALLS IN THE TRENCH APPROACH TO THE EXHAUST PORTUGUESE
ALOT OF BARS AND A HOCKEY TEAM
MOUNT THE SUPER LASERS ON THE STAR DESTROYERS
I WOULD JUST MAKE IT LIKE THE DARKSABER WHERE IT'S JUST AN ENGINE PLUS THE WEAPON ITSELF PLUS THE BRIDGE YEAH IT'S NOT AS BIG AND SCARY BUT IT WILL STILL GET THE JOB DONE AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO BE BUILT FASTER

AND SO PEOPLE DON'T GET CONFUSED THERE IS THE DARKSABER LIGHTSABER WHICH WAS INTRODUCED BY MANDALORIANS IN THE CLONE WARS AND THE DARKSABER WEAPON WHICH WAS A LEGENDS CREATION WHERE THE TRIED TO BUILD THEIR OWN DS USING THE CREATOR OF THE ORIGINAL ONE AND GIVING IT THAT NAME TO MOCK THE JEDI
RATHER THAN ONE LARGE EXHAUST PORT I'D HAVE MILLIONS OF LIKE INCH WIDE PORTS ALL OVER THE STATION
OP I THINK YOU PICKED THE WRONG PLACE TO TALK ABOUT HOW LITTLE YOU LIKE STAR WARS LORE
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU HATE OF STAR WARS THEN ALL HOPE IS LOST
I'D PRETTY MUCH REWRITE THE JEDI AS A WHOLE
I'D EXPAND THE TIME THE EMPIRE WAS IN CONTROL TO YEARS AND HAVE ANAKIN BECOME VADER MUCH MORE SLOWLY HAVING HIM TURN INTO A CYBORG GRADUALLY OVER MANY YEARS WE WOULD SEE HIM EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY GIVE UP HIS HUMANITY IN THE NAME OF CONTROL AND POWER

I'D HAVE FADME AND ANAKIN MEET AND FALL IN LOVE WHEN THEY'RE BOTH IN THEIR AND ANAKIN IS ALREADY FALLEN TO THE DARK SIDE

IN ANH I'D MAKE OBI WAN MUCH LESS OF A WISE OLD MAN AND MORE A PTSD SUFFERING VETERINARY AND I'D FOCUS MUCH MORE ON HOW RISKY TRAINING LUKE IS AND HOW MUCH OF A DESPERATE ACT IT WOULD BE TO SEND AN UNTESTED TEENAGER ON A SUICIDE MISSION
TWIN SISTER SHOULD HAVE BEEN A NEW CHARACTER NOT LEIA
CAN WE EXTEND TO THIS REAL WORLD LORE ABOUT STAR WARS I'D LIKE TO REWRITE THE OT HIPSTERS OUT OF EXISTENCE OR ANYONE WHO HATES TO BE COOL FOR THAT MATTER

EDIT SINCE WE APPARENTLY HAVE SOME STRUGGLING WITH UNDERSTANDING PROPER SENTENCE STRUCTURE

ANYONE IS THE NOUN IN THIS SENTENCE WHICH WOULD MEAN HATES IS A VERB SIMILAR TO SAYING ANYONE WHO SMOKES TO BE COOL
THE RULE OF TWO
IMO

I WAS PRETTY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE MANDALORIANS IN THE CLONE WARS SERIES

UP UNTIL THE ACW THE WERE THE MOST BADASS FEARED MYTHICAL WARRIORS IN MY BOOK THE TALES OF THEIR FEROCITY RIVALS THE SITH ORDER IN SOME CASES WHAT ACW DID WAS INTRODUCE A WEIRD OVERDONE WATERED DOWN MANDALORIAN GROUP THAT SEEMED WAY TO CARTOONIST FOR THEIR HISTORY I LAUGHED AND SNORTED AT THE WHOLE DEATH WATCH NAME IT SEEM CHILDISH

GENERALLY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN FAVOR OF THE CANNON CHANGES LEGENDS SEEMED A BIT MUDDLED GROWING UP I NEVER REALLY KNEW WHAT THE OFFICIAL STORY WAS BUT DAMN EVERYONE AGREED THE MANDALORIANS WERE NEAR EXTINCT AND WEREN'T EMBROILED IN SOME DOMESTIC TERRORISM PLOWLINE I FEEL LIKE ACW DIDN'T PORTRAY THE MANDALORIANS LIKE I EXPECTED THEM TO

AH WELL IF THAT'S THE WORST PART FOR ME THEN WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD
LEIA IS NO LONGER A SKYWALKER NO SECOND OR THIRD DEATH STARS NO MIDICHLORIANS ANAKIN HAS A DAD AND MAUL IS THE VILLAIN FOR ALL PREQUEL
MAKING THE LIGHTSABER CRYSTALS BACK TO HOW THEY SHOULD BE THEY SHOULD COME IN DIFFERENT COLORS AND RED SHOULD BE SYNTHETIC
FIRST THINGS FIRST FUCK MIDICHLORIANS
PROBABLY A WWI FLYING ACE JOKE
I SAW THE SNOOPY FIRST THEN SAW THE SCHULTZ SIGNATURE AND THEN FIGURED THERE HAS TO BE A INSIDE JOKE
IT'S ON THE COLLAR SNOOPY
BETTER QUESTION WHY IS LASER MISSPELLED
SOMETIME IN THE LATE S SNOOPY STARTED IMAGINING HIMSELF AS VADER PILOTING A TIE FIGHTER INSTEAD OF BEING A WORLD WAR I FLYING ACE THIS IS A SCENE OF WHAT HE SAW IN HIS HEAD


ONE OF MY FAVORITE STAR WARS CHARACTERS LOOKS AWESOME DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE SHOTS TAKEN OTHER ANGLES
MY MAN
WOULD ANYONE ELSE PREFER A JAGO FETT MOVIE INSTEAD OF W BOBA FETT MOVIE
HE IS NO FRIEND IF HE DOES NOT TAKE THEM
THESE ARE AWESOME I LIKE HOW THE DARTH VADER DESCRIPTION DEPICTS HIM AS THE HENCHMAN OF LARKIN DEFINITELY SOME NEAT STUFF
FUCKING HELL THESE ARE INCREDIBLE A REAL TREASURE
THIS COMIC HAS HAD A PRETTY CONSISTENT EDGY TONE I DON'T THINK IT FITS IT FEELS MORE LIKE A MODERN AAA VIDEO GAME
HIS CONFRONTATION WITH BOBA WAS SO COOL

HAVEN'T READ UP TO THE SECOND PIC WHAT ISSUE IS THAT FROM
A STORM-TROOPER CAN DODGE A LIGHTSABER THEN KNOCK OUT A JEDI BUT CAN'T SHOOT A BLASTER
I JUST INTERPRETED THESE SITUATIONS AS LUKE TRYING TO BEND THE FORCE TO HIS WILL WHICH IS NOT THE WAY IT WORKS IT PUTS INTO PERSPECTIVE THE TIMES IN EMPIRE WHEN HE HAD TO LEARN TO FEEL THE FORCE AND CENTER HIMSELF BEFORE BEING ABLE TO MANIPULATE PHYSICAL OBJECTS

THERE IS A MOMENT IN THE LATEST ISSUE WHERE HE JUST LASHES OUT IN ANGER AND BENDS THE FORCE TO HIS WILL WHICH IS THE PATH TO THE DARK SIDE

WE ARE LITERALLY SEEING LESSONS IN PRACTICE
EVEN WITH IT'S FLAWS NEW STAR WARS BOOKS ARE PRETTY DAMN FUN TO READ THE KANAN SERIES IS WORTH CHECKING OUT AS WELL
THIS IS ONE THING THAT KIND OF GETS ON MY NERVES A BIT THEY NEED TO SHOW LUKE HAVE SOME PROGRESSION THROUGHOUT THESE STORIES IN TERMS OF POWER HE STRUGGLES A LOT IN HEIR TO THE JEDI AS WELL AND WEAPON OF A JEDI STRUGGLE IS GOOD BUT WHEN YOU'VE BEEN STRUGGLING FOR AWHILE ACROSS MULTIPLE STORIES IT KIND OF GETS IRRITATING HE DOES OBVIOUSLY GET BETTER BY THE TIME OF RETURN OF THE JEDI AND IT SHOWS EVEN MORE IN THE POST COMIC SHATTERED EMPIRE BUT IT'S A MASSIVE POWER JUMP I WANT TO SEE HIS POWER SLOWLY CREEP ACROSS THESE STORIES AND HAVE IT LINE UP WITH SHATTERED EMPIRE RATHER THAN HIM JUST DOING BAD OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE ALL THE TIME HE IS THE SON OF THE CHOSEN ONE AFTER ALL
LUKE YOUR GRANDPA CAN'T BAIL YOU OUT ALL THE TIME

HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE LUKE GETTING A BIT BETTER AT SENSING OR AT LEAST NOT GETTING DISTRACTED
I SOMEHOW FEEL LIKE MARVEL HAVEN'T BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB FOR THIS BOOK AND THE VADER ONE IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE STAR WARS TO ME FEELS MORE LIKE FAN FICTION LIKE WHEN LUKE WAS CAPTURED BY THE HUTT IN NAR SHARDANA THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE HAN CHEWIE AND LEIA ALL HELD A LIGHTSABER IT FEELS SO OUT OF PLACE AND THE REBELS HAVING A BOMBASTIC ENCOUNTER WITH VADER BEFORE ESB AND THE DESIGNS WHAT'S WITH THOSE CHITAURI MOTHERSHIP IN THE VADER BOOK

MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BECAUSE I KINDA SEE THE MOVIE AND THE COMICS AS ONE CONTINUATION OF STORY AND THE COMICS ISN'T DOING THE MOVIE ANY FAVOR BY TELLING THOSE STORIES KINDA LIKE WHAT THE PREQUEL DID
THE EU MAKING BOBA FETT NOT BE A JOBBER IS THE BIGGEST LOL EVER
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT I JUST CAN'T GET INTO IT CONSISTENTLY SEASONS IN AND I FEEL ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR OUR REBEL PROTAGONISTS I JUST CAN'T MAKE A CONNECTION WITH THEM I'LL ENJOY AN EPISODE HERE AND THERE BUT I FEEL LIKE I SLOG THROUGH THE REST

AS TIME GOES ON I FIND THAT I JUST WATCH IT TO KEEP TRACK WITH WHATS GOING ON IN CANON AND OCCASIONALLY SEEING SOME COOL SCENES NOT BECAUSE I ENJOY IT ON A LARGE SCALE
SEASON ONE IS PASSABLE BUT NOT GREAT SIMILAR TO SEASON ONE OF THE CLONE WARS IN ALL HONESTY

SEASON TWO IS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT WITH MORE INTERESTING STORYLINES AND THE CHARACTERS START TO REALLY COME INTO THEIR OWN FURTHERMORE THE SEASON TWO FINALE IS MY SINGLE FAVOURITE EPISODE BETWEEN BOTH CLONE WARS AND REBELS


SEASON HAS BEEN KIND OF INCONSISTENT AN INTERESTING VILLAIN EVEN IF HE HASN'T DONE MUCH OF ANYTHING AND THE FIRST TWO EPISODES PLUS EPISODE SIX HAVE BEEN GREAT BUT BEYOND THAT IT'S BEEN KIND OF A SLOW SEASON MIND YOU IT'S ONLY ABOUT SEVEN EPISODES IN SO IT'S A BIT EARLY TO JUDGE


OVERALL I LIKE IT AND THINK IT'S WORTH WATCHING ALTHOUGH BE AWARE THAT IT'S NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS CLONE WARS
IT'S DECENT GREAT AT TIMES
CLONE WARS IS BETTER BUT IT'S AT LEAST SOMETHING
IF YOU ENJOYED CLONE WARS YOU'LL PROBABLY ENJOY REBELS

EDIT
AND YEAH SEASON 2 OF REBELS IS A BIT MORE INTENSE THAN SEASON
COMPARED TO SEASON 2 AND OF ACW ID SAY ITS DECENT AT THIS TIME EVEN WITH THE LACKLUSTER EPISODE LAST WEEK AND I PREDICT TODAY
I ALSO DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO GET ANY TRULY GREAT EPISODES UNTIL AFTER ROGUE ONE IS OUT

THE SEASON 2 FINALE WAS DEFINITIVELY MORE EXCITING THAN THE ACW COUNTERPART MY MAIN GRIPE WITH REBELS CRITICISM IS THAT THEY USUALLY GO OFF ACW LATER SEASONS COMPARING SEASON AND OF ACW WHEN WE ARE NOT EVEN HALF WAY DONE WITH SEASON IS KINDA UNFAIR

EDIT GRAMMAR

THIS WHOLE THREAD IS HILARIOUS TO ME I WANT TO CHECK OUT REBELS WHEN I'M DONE WITH ACW BUT THIS SHOW FEELS LIKE PUNISHMENT IT'S SO TONALLY SCHIZOPHRENIC WHEREIN PEOPLE ARE BEING EXECUTED IN THE STREETS ONE SECOND AND A CHARACTER SHRUGS THEIR SHOULDERS AND BLOWS RASPBERRIES THE NEXT I CAN'T IMAGINE REBELS BEING MUCH BETTER IF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S TERRIBLE IN COMPARISON
FOR SOMEONE WHO LOVES ACW IT'S A DECENT SHOW BUT IT'S RESTRAINED BY BUDGET AND SOME EPISODES MAY SEEM RUSHED AS THERE ARE NO SO CALLED ARCS CONSISTING OUT OF OR EPISODES TO FLESH OUT THE VARIOUS PLOTS MORE SMOOTHLY THERE MAY BE MORE CARTOONIST AND CHILDISH MOMENTS IN HERE BUT IT'S NOTHING DEVASTATING
THE TWO-PART OPENING TO SEASON 2 OF REBELS SIEGE OF LETHAL IS TOP NOTCH STUFF AND PROBABLY THE BEST THE SERIES HAS TO OFFER UP TO NOW IF YOU WATCH NOTHING ELSE THIS IS WORTH YOUR TIME

OVERALL SEASON WAS GOOD WITH SPOTS OF GREATNESS SEASON 2 WAS CONSISTENTLY GREAT

SEASON HAS STRUGGLED TO MEET THE BENCHMARKS OF SEASON 2 SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN SOME QUESTIONABLE FILLER EPISODES BEING THE BIGGEST CULPRIT THERE'S STILL A BUNCH OF EPISODES LEFT SO FINAL JUDGMENT ON THE SEASON SHOULD PROBABLY WAIT



I ENJOY IT A LOT AND I AM ALSO A BIG FAN OF ACW THE STORY IS MORE FOCUSED ON A REBEL CELL LEARNING HOW TO CHOOSE TO WIN AGAINST THE EMPIRE THERE ARE A LOT OF CHARACTER BUILDING MOMENTS IN THE SHOW THE SECOND AND THIRD SEASON TENDS TO SHIFT DIRECTIONS A LOT QUICKER THAN THE FIRST THE FIRST IS ALSO ONLY A PARTIAL SEASON EPISODES IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE FULL SEASON IT IS IN JUNIOR NOVELS AND COMICS HERE



ALL IN ALL REBELS IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED LUCASFILM TO RELEASE BUT HAS SO MUCH WONDERFUL STAR WARS
I'D SAY REBELS GOT OFF TO A MUCH STRONGER START THAN ACW THE MOMENTUM FROM THAT SHOW HELPED CARRY REBELS INITIALLY AT THIS POINT I'D SAY THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY OF EQUIVALENT QUALITY WITH EACH HAVING GOOD AND BAD POINTS MY JUDGEMENT IS BASED MOSTLY ON THE QUALITY OF THE BEST EPISODES I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO FACTOR IN THE MORE FILLER KID EPISODES WHICH ARE TO BE EXPECTED WHEN JUDGING
AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP WITH OT AND HATES THE PREQUEL I WAS NEVER ABLE TO GET INTO CLONE WARS BUT WITH REBELS I'VE FOUND IT QUITE FUN IT FEELS LIKE STAR WARS TO ME REBELS IS CERTAINLY WRITTEN FOR KIDS BUT IT'S BEEN ENJOYABLE THE 2ND SEASON FINALE WAS REALLY QUITE GOOD AND THE SHOW HAS SURPRISED ME MANY TIMES
LOVE IT COMPARED TO CLONE WARS
THE TWO SHOWS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT AND WHILST I FEEL THAT REBELS HAS NOT YET REACHED THE HEIGHTS CW DID CONSISTENTLY IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SURPASS IT IN THE LONG RUN THUS FAR ON A SEASON TO SEASON BASIS IT HAS BEEN BETTER WITH SEASON OF REBELS BEING BETTER THAN SEASON OF CW ECT LIKE CW IT HAS GOT BETTER ON SEASON TO SEASON BASIS

AS YOU LIKELY KNOW THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE FACT THAT REBELS FOCUSES ON ONE GROUP OF CHARACTERS WHICH IS A BENEFIT IN TERMS OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BUT A DRAW BACK IN THAT YOU DON'T FEAR FOR THEM DYING THE WAY YOU DID WITH MANY CHARACTERS IN CW

BUT YEAH THE SHOW HAS IMPROVED SINCE SEASON AND DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF IT IT MAY BE MORE SUITED TO YOU NOW AS A CW FAN ESPECIALLY WITH S THE ADDITIONS OF MAUL REX AND ASOKA
THE MID-SEASON 2 TRAILER IS WHAT GOT ME INTO REBELS BUT BEWARE IT'S A LITTLE SPOILER
REBELS IS A POOR MAN'S CLONE WARS STILL A GOOD SHOW AND WORTH WATCHING BUT INFERIOR IN EVERY SINGLE WAY
LIKE YOU MOST PEOPLE YOU REMEMBER CLONE WARS AS A WHOLE CLONE WARS WAS QUITE BAD DURING THE FIRST TWO SEASONS THE FIRST TWO SEASON OF REBELS ARE BETTER THAN THE FIRST TWO SEASONS OF CLONE WARS THE FINALE OF SEASON 2 OF REBELS IS AMAZING AND ALREADY SURPASSES CLONE WARS DURING SEASON 2 NOW ON IT'S THIRD SEASON REBELS IS GREAT AND I THINK OVERALL IT MIGHT BE JUST AS GOOD AND PROBABLY BETTER THAN CLONE WARS IN FACT I PERSONALLY THINK THAT REBELS HAS SURPASSED CLONE WARS ALREADY I CONSIDER IT A MUST WATCH FOR EVERY STAR WARS FAN
REBELS IS BASICALLY ACW ON STEROIDS THE FIRST SEASON STARTS OFF A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN EARLY ACW BUT DEFINITELY ISN'T PERFECT HOWEVER BY THE END OF SEASON IT RAMPS UP TO CITADEL LEVEL QUALITY AND BY THE END OF SEASON 2 IS SOLIDLY BETTER THAN EVEN THE BEST OF ACW THOUGH IT IS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE IT STANDS ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS REBELS REALLY IS ACW PART 2
SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ACW
PFFT
AIM A LITTLE HIGHER YOUR WIFE PROBABLY
HAVE FUN STICKING YOUR HAND DOWN THERE
ANYONE HAS A BETTER IDEA OF WHERE TO STICK THIS BESIDES THE TOILET
WOULDN'T IT COME OFF WHEN YOU SCRUB YOUR TOILET
I CAN JUST IMAGED SOMEONE WHO IS REALLY STONED AT AND GOES INTO THE BATHROOM WITH ONLY A NIGHT-LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE THE ROOM LIFTS UP THE JOLIET SEAT COVER AND OOOOOHHH GOD
R DICHY
MY TOILET ALREADY LOOKS LIKE A SARLAC PIT
I MEAN THIS IS COOL SURE BUT IT EITHER COMES OFF IN THE WATER OR GETS GOOPY AFTER A FEW USES RIGHT
I THOUGHT THEY SMELLED BAD ON THE OUTSIDE ARM NO WAIT
GROSS
IS IS THIS REAL IF SO WHERE CAN I BUY IT
BITS OF POOP WILL GET STUCK TO THE CORNERS OF THE STICKERS AND ITLL LOOK REALLY DISGUSTING
IT LOOKS LIKE A GREAT MOTIVATOR FOR A CHILD TO START THROWING ALL THEIR ACTION FIGURES INTO THE TOILET
I'M OLD FASHIONED AND THINK THAT YOU SHOULD JUST PUT PISS AND SHIT AND OCCASIONAL CLEANING MATERIALS INTO A TOILET

WHO'S WITH ME
MET THE CREATOR AT COMIC CON A FEW YEARS AGO GOOD DUDE
R CRAPPYDESIGN
I FELT A GREAT DISTURBANCE IN THE FORCE AS IF MILLIONS OF PENISES SUDDENLY CRIED OUT IN TERROR AND SUDDENLY TURTLED
SARLAC EATS PIECES OF SHIT FOR BREAKFAST
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL TAKING ABOUT TAKING A DUMP ON BOBA EVERYDAY
CHM NO THANKS I DON'T WANT TENTACLES UP MY BLUEHOLE I PREFER THEM UP SOMEONE ELSES BLUEHOLE
I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT STUPID PLANT BEAK THING FROM THE SPECIAL EDITIONS
ARE THOSE DECALS SEEMS LIKE THEY'D JUST COME OFF WHEN YOU FLUSH OR CLEAN THE TOILET
I'D LOVE TO MEET THE PERSON WHO'D DO THIS KIND OF THING LOOKS COOL BUT THAT'S IT I'D HATE TO CLEAN THOSE SHIT STICKERS
ABY LAO
I GOT TO DROP A BOBA REAL QUICK
THE CREATOR OF THIS AND THE BATHTUB JAWS DECAL SET IS A FORMER STUDENT OF MINE SUPER TALENTED AND CREATIVE GUY
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT THE SPECIAL EDITION SARLAC SERIOUSLY COULD YOU IMAGINE THE SHOCK AS A GIANT WORM REACHED OUT OF THE TOILET AND PINCHED YOUR BUTT
ABY LAO
ORDERING MYSELF THIS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT
I WILL TROW MY BOBA BEETS IN BERE
ONE DAY I FOUND THIS BIG LOG I ROLLED OVER THE LOG AND FOUND A STICK I WAS LIKE THIS LOG HAD A CHILD
THAT WAS ACTUALLY SO WELL DONE WHEN HE SAID PUT ME DOWN WHEN HE WAS ON BACK I JUST DIED
THESE BAD LIP READING STAR WARS SONG ARE WAY BETTER AND CATCHIER THEN THEY HAVE ANY RIGHT TO BE THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT ONE BUSHES OF LOVE WHERE OBI WON EXPLAINS TO LUKE WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS FATHER IN SONG BY THE SAME GUYS

WATCH V RYSHDUU
ROCKIE ROCKIE AND ROLLIN DOWN TO THE BEACH I'M STROLLING BUT THE SEAGULLS POKE AT MY HEAD NOT FUN I SAID SEAGULLS MHHH STOP IT NOW
I LOVE EVERYTHING THIS GUY DOES THEY'RE ALL SO GOOD HIS STAR WARS GAME OF THRONES AND THE WALKING DEAD ONES ARE MY FAVORITES
I'M SO HAPPY THEY MADE THIS LONGER
DON'T FALL ASLEEP
I'M SO GLAD IT'S FINALLY HERE MY BROTHER AND I MEMORIZED THE OTHER TWO BUSHES OF LOVE AND IT'S NOT THE FUTURE AND WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE YODA SONG SINCE LOVE THIS ONE TOO CAN'T WAIT TO ANNOY THE REST OF THE FAMILY WITH IT WE'RE A LITTLE PITCHY
THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE BEST THUMBNAILS FROM A STAR WARS MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN
THIS WAS MY FAVORITE PIECE OF THE EMPIRE LIP READING I'VE BEEN WAITING TOO LONG FOR THIS

ALSO THAT LOG HAD A CHILD
I UH-HUH JUST WOW
I FRIGGING LOVE THESE GUYS OR GUY I PLAY ALL OF THESE FOR MY SON AND I I HAD BUSHES OF LOVE JAMMED IN MY HEAD FOR A FEW DAYS I STILL LOVE LISTENING TO IT
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS JUST WISH THEY WEREN'T ALL SONGS NOW
BALR IS A GENIUS
CAME TO THIS SUBREDDIT TO POST THIS

SO GOOD
THERE'S AN EDITED VERSION ON YOUTUBE WITH JUST PART ON LOOP I MUST HAVE WATCHED AN SUNG ALONG OVER A TIME THATS PROBABLY A GROSS UNDERESTIMATION

A WORD
NOT THE BEST
WHERE IS THIS
OUTSIDE DE BEERS DOWN BY THE FOOD COURT
I THOUGHT IT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A TROOPER SMACKING HIS HEAD ON THE SHIP
IF THESE ARE ALL HOT TOYS FIGURES YOU COULD BUY A VERY NICE CAR WITH THE SAME COST AS THIS DIORAMA
WHY DID YOU POST THIS
AWFUL TITLE BUT OTHERWISE THAT'S PRETTY DOPE
NICE BUTT
LOOKS LIKE THE SARLAC WASN'T THE ONLY CRACK THAT WAS HUNGRY AMBRITE
IVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS WEIRD THAT HIS POPULAR OUTFIT IS THE ROTC ARMOR WITH THE ESB HELMET INSTEAD OF BEING THE FULL COSTUME FROM EITHER MOVIE
ENNING THAT'S SEXY
WELL DONE
THEY SHOOT PLASMA NOT LASERS

2 THEY ACTUALLY HAVE GREAT AIM THE HEROES JUST BENEFIT FROM PLOT ARMOR
IF MEMORY SERVES THEY FIRE PLASMA NOT LASERS
THEY ACTUALLY DO PRETTY GOOD WATCH THE INITIAL ATTACK ON TACTIVE AND THE SNOW BATTLE ON HOTH

IT IS JUST WHEN OUR MAIN CHARACTERS ARE ON SCREEN THAT THEY SEEM UNABLE TO AIM PERHAPS THEY ARE JUST STAR STRUCK
I THOUGHT THEY HAD SHITTY AIM ON THE DEATH STAR BECAUSE THEY WERE PURPOSELY LETTING THEM ESCAPE BECAUSE THEY PUT A TRACKING DEVICE ON THE MILLENNIUM FALCON
LIGHTSABERS DEFINEDLY HAVE MASSACHUSETTS

THEY CAN'T BE MADE OF LIGHT BECAUSE LIGHT CANNOT INTERACT WITH LIGHT SO DUELS WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE

SECONDLY THEY ACTUALLY LEAVE A SHADOW IN ONE OF THE EPISODES OF THE FULLY CANON TV SHOW THE CLONE WARS
BLASTERS ARE NOT ACTUALLY LASERS THEY'RE AN EXOTIC ENERGY WEAPON USUALLY CONSIDERED TO BE PLASMA THAT JUST HAPPEN TO BE CALLED LASERS BECAUSE LASER IS A GENERIC TERM FOR ALL ENERGY WEAPONS IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE
REBELS USUALLY LOOK HAPPIEST WHEN THEY'RE FLYING AROUND WREAKING HAVOC
I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE AT LUCASFILM JUST CAN'T HOLD BACK GOOD FOOTAGE THE WHOLE PART AFTER THE WAS STRUCK WAS UNNECESSARY AND RUINED THE SURPRISE PLEASE STOP SPOILING THINGS IN TRAILERS
FUCK ME THAT SPACE BATTLE IS GONNA LOOK SO FUCKING AWESOME THE SHOTS FROM FFA ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT THEY SHOWED US SO FAR OF THIS SPACE BATTLE
WHEW THAT SPACE BATTLE
I FEEL LIKE THE VOICE OF THE WHOLE FRANCHISE HAD CRIED OUT IN TERROR AND WAS SUDDENLY SILENCED

IS JOHN WILLIAMS INVOLVED IN THIS AT ALL
DID HE GET THE TAT
SHE LIVES IN A BROKEN-DOWN THERE'S PROBABLY A TOILET SOMEWHERE IN THERE
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED A REFRESHER COURSE
GO TO BED YOUR TIRED AND HIGH IT WON'T MATTER IN THE MORNING WHEN YOUR WELL RESTED AND SOBER
IF THEY CAN FIND A WAY TO SHIT ON TATTOOING I'M SURE THEY CAN DO THE SAME ON ZAKKEU
ZAKKEU HAS TECHNOLOGY IT'S JUST NOT EXTRAVAGANT I LIKE TO IMAGINE THERE'S SOME TYPE OF LATRINE SOMEWHERE HOOKED INTO THE GROUND THAT JUST ROCKETS ALL OF THE WASTE DEEP DOWN INTO THE SAND
YES
PROBABLY DIGS HOLES
WE PROBABLY SHOULD TRY TO REMEMBER WHAT WE DID HERE BEFORE WE FINALLY DEVELOPED THE ELECTRIC AND TOILETS WE HAVE NOW
YEAH SURE I KNOW PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THOSE CHARACTERS ARE AT ALL THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT
BUZZFEED DID A VIDEO ON PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT STAR WARS THERE WERE QUITE A FEW WHO DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING MY FAVORITE WAS THINKING OBI WAN KENOBI WAS A DROID
WHAAAAAAAT
I'VE KNOWN A SMALL HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO KNEW THE LINE BUT NOT TO WHOM IT REFERRED IT'S MIND BOGGLING TO THINK ABOUT SOMEONE NEVER HAVING SEEN EVEN PARTS OF THESE MOVIES BUT AS I GROW OLDER I KEEP MEETING MORE PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T
I DID ACTUALLY MY LITTLE COUSIN THE ONLY STAR WARS HE KNOWS IS REBELS AND ONLY ONE OF THE MOVIES HE HAS A SMALL COLLECTION OF REBELS TOYS INCLUDING A VADER ONE I ASKED HIM IF HE KNEW WHO VADER WAS AND WHILE HE DID KNOW VADER WAS ANAKIN SKYWALKER HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS FATHER HE HASN'T SEEN THE STAR WARS MOVIES EXCEPT FOR FFA WHICH HE LOVED AND HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH FREE FROM PT OT SPOILERS SINCE HE WAS BORN I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HIS REACTION TO THE BIG REVEAL ONCE HE SEES THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY WHICH ACCORDING TO HIS PARENTS WON'T BE UNTIL A FEW DAYS BEFORE ROGUE ONE COMES OUT
NUMBER YOU'D HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY CUT OFF FROM POP CULTURE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE I AM NOT FRIENDS WITH ANY MENNONITE OR AMISH
I'M NOT AN ADULT BUT THE ONLY WAY I ASSUME PEOPLE WOULD NOT KNOW IS JUST BECAUSE IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE IT'S PRETTY MUCH CONSIDERING BASIC COMMON KNOWLEDGE AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T NEED TO OPENLY MENTION IT WHEN TALKING TO OTHER FANS
ONE OF MY FRIEND'S DIDN'T UNTIL HE WATCHED IT HE WAS AROUND WHEN HE SAW IT
ONE OF MY FRIENDS HAD NO CLUE WHO VADER AND LUKE EVEN WERE I MADE HER WATCH ANH WITH THE INTENT OF GETTING HER TO WATCH THE WHOLE OT WITH ME SHE THOUGHT ANH WAS BORING AND THAT LUKE WAS TOO MUCH OF A MARY SUE AND REFUSED TO WATCH EMPIRE SIGH

SHE DIDN'T KNOW BECAUSE SHE'S CHINESE AND STAR WARS ISN'T A HUGE PART OF THEIR POP CULTURE HER ONLY EXPOSURE TO IT HAS BEEN THE TOYS THAT HER COWORKERS KEEP ON THEIR DESKS
I LOVE THE FACT THAT PALATINE IS LITERALLY DESTROYING DEMOCRACY IN THIS SCENE
DO IT
DUEL OF THE FATES THE CLONE ARMY YOU WERE MY BROTHER ANAKIN DARTH VADER IN ARMOR FOR THE FIRST TIME THESE AND MANY OF OTHER MOMENTS WERE GREAT BUT I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER SIMIOUS AND YODA STARTING TO FIGHT THEN THE PLATFORM STARTS MOVING AND MFG IT'S THE SENATE
OF ALL THE THINGS WRONG WITH THE PREQUEL ART DIRECTION SURE AS HELL ISN'T ONE OF THEM
I GOTTA SAY ONE THING I REALLY LIKED ABOUT THE PREQUEL WAS LIGHTSABER SKILLS I'M NOT JOKING I HONESTLY REALLY LIKED IT HEAR ME OUT YODA WAS THE MOST POWERFUL GREATEST JEDI WE'VE SEEN AND DEFINITELY IS UP THERE IN THE EU AS ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER IT IS MADE CLEAR THAT A LIGHTSABER IS THE WEAPON OF A JEDI EVEN IN THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY THE ONLY TO USE A LIGHTSABER WAS HAN BUT IT WAD FOR ABOUT SECONDS TO CUT OPEN A TAUN TAUN AND YOU COULD TELL HE WASN'T GREAT WITH IT THE WAY HE HELD IT HIS HESITATION AT SWINGING IT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT JUST S WEAPON FOR ANYONE TRUE HAN PREFERS A BLASTER BUT NO IS EVER SEEN OWNING ONE IN ALL THREE MOVIES IN THE PREQUEL ESPECIALLY EPISODE II IT'S MADE CLEAR THAT EVERY JEDI HAS A LIGHTSABER AND IT IS AN INSEPARABLE PART OF THEM WELL IN THEORY IT'S INSEPARABLE BUT ANAKIN LOST TWO LIGHTSABERS THEN ONE AS DARTH VADER IN EPISODE VI BUT I DIGRESS LIGHTSABERS ARE A TOOL OF THE JEDI AND WITH THAT IN MIND IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE GREATEST JEDI EVER WOULD BE AMAZING WITH A LIGHTSABER YODA IS CONSTANTLY MOVING STRIKING AND BLOCKING WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED NEVER GIVING HIS OPPONENT A CHANCE TO TAKE A BREATH IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO ME THAT HE WOULD HAVE ONE HE'S TOO OLD IN THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY TO TAKE ON VADER AND SIMIOUS ON HIS OWN BUT IN THE PREQUEL HE'S STILL GOT ENOUGH FIGHT IN HIM TO TAKE ON DOOK AND LATER SIMIOUS ONE LAST TIME I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT AND I RESPECT THEIR ARGUMENTS I JUST WANTED TO SAY WHY I PERSONALLY LIKED IT
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN STEVEN SPIELBERG DIRECTED THAT SCENE I KNOW HE HELPED LUCAS DIRECT A FEW SCENES IN SITH
IF THERE WAS ONE THING LACKING FROM FORCE AWAKENS I THOUGHT IT WAS MOMENTS LIKE THIS I KNOW THERE WILL BE THOSE THAT DISAGREE BUT FOR ALL THIER FLAWS THE PREQUEL FELT MORE LIKE THEY WERE IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE THE FORCE AWAKENS FELT SMALLER SOMEHOW
I LOVE THE PREQUEL
ROS IS MY FAVORITE OF THE PREQUEL TRILOGY AND THIS FIGHT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN THE SERIES
THE SENATE ROOM IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES IN STAR WARS IT JUST LOOKS SO AWESOME
IT'S A POWERFUL SHOT A CULMINATION OF MANY YEARS DECEIVING THE JEDI COUNSEL AND ORCHESTRATING AN INSANELY COMPLEX PLOT TO RULE THE GALAXY FINALLY COMING TO FRUITION
THE PT HAD INDEED SOME AMAZING SHOTS
WELL THE PREQUEL HAD A LOT OF GOOD SHOTS
IT IS AN IMPRESSIVE SCENE THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE WAS HOW DARTH SIMIOUS LOOKED SO OBVIOUSLY CRIED THEN THEY WOULD RANDOMLY CUT BACK AND FORTH TO IAN MCDIARMID MAKING A RIDICULOUS FACE THEN BACK TO CGI DARTH SIMIOUS

DON'T GET ME WRONG I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CGI BUT IT SEEMED LIKE DARTH SIMIOUS WAS DONE WITH LESS QUALITY THAN THE REST OF THE CGI IN THE PREQUEL
I EVER KNEW HIS OFFICE WAS RIGHT UNDER THAT ROOM PLOT TWIST
THEY DID HAVE THEIR MOMENTS
OH THOSE PREQUEL WERE TERRIBLE BUT I LIKED THEM AND STILL WATCH THEM SOMETIMES I LIKE THE UNIVERSE EXPANSION
THIS SCENE IS THE ULTIMATE CLASH OF LIGHT AND DARK THE GRAND MASTER OF THE JEDI AGAINST THE DARK LORD OF THE SITH WINNER TAKE ALL
WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE YODA
EH
I QUESTION THE WISDOM OF SMUGGLING OUT THE DEATH STAR PLANS AS CLOTHING GRAPHICS BUT THEN AGAIN IT APPARENTLY WORKED


I'M ACTUALLY REALLY SURPRISED THERE'S NO INDIVIDUAL POSTERS OF VADER OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE KEEPING AN AIR OF MYSTERY AROUND HIM BUT I THOUGHT HE'D BE A HUGE MARKETING PUSH TO BE HONEST
INTERESTING HOW THE ONLY CHARACTER LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO CAMERA IS THE BLIND GUY HE CAN SEE THINGS BEYOND HIS OWN WORLD
SHHHIT SAW LOOKS AWESOME
WAIT

IS STAFF A BOWCASTER
DO YOU KNOW THE SOURCE
NOW WE WENT THIS WITHOUT THE LETTERS
REMOVED
NOW THIS IS PRORACING
IT'S FUNNY HOW MANY OF THESE POSTERS THERE ARE NOW ALL THE EXACT SAME CONCEPT COLLAGE OF FLOATING CHARACTERS HEADS GETTING SLIGHTLY BETTER EACH TIME BUT STILL NOT PARTICULARLY GREAT

ALRIGHT I'VE TOTALLY GOT IT THIS TIME THIS IS THE ONE THIS IS DEFINITELY THE ONE
THE SECOND ONE IS BEAUTIFUL LIKE THE MAIN POSTER USED IN CINEMAS WITH FACE BEING WAY BIGGER THAN THE REST

WITH THE OTHERS IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH SPACE TO GIVE TO THE CHARACTERS
THAT FIRST ONE THE WAY EVERYTHING IS MESHED TOGETHER HETP
PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS BEING SHOWN IN IMAX AND NOT IMAX 3D STANDARD IMAX IS BEAUTIFUL BUT SEEING THINGS IN 3D I DON'T LIKE SO MUCH
HIGH RES
ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE BETTER THAN WHAT THEY'VE USED UP TO NOW
WALLPAPER
THE FIRST IS DEFINITELY MY FAVOURITE I THINK IT LOOKS FANTASTIC WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT ON MY WALL
WHAT'S THAT CREATURE ON THE SECOND POSTER LOOKS LIKE AN EKWOK HAD A BABY WITH A GREMLIN
THESE ARE THE BEST ONES BY FAR IMO MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE I LOVE THIS DOUBLE EXPOSURE STYLE BUT THEY'VE HAD A FEW IFFY POSTERS SO FAR THESE BEEN THE ONES EVERYWHERE
SECOND AND THIRD ARE MY FAVORITES WISH THE POSTERS WERE DONE BY DREW STRUZAN THOUGH
HOW DO I GET ONE OF THESE
BODHI LOOKS STUPID WITH THAT POSE ON THE SECOND POSTER A STANDING ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
CAN SOMEONE SHOP THE IMAX PORTION OUT OF THESE THREE PICTURES
I HATE THAT THESE ARE EXCLUSIVE TO AMC IMAX THEATRES
CHIRRUP WITH HIS SICK DAB IN THAT 3RD POSTER
GET SABER OUT OF THERE
HAN S SOLO UNDER THE IMAGE
WHY DO THEY MAKE IT WHITE AND ORANGE
THAT'S FANTASTIC
SO COOL I WANT THE FORCE AWAKENS VINYL WITH THE HOLOGRAM TIE FIGHTERS
WHY THE HECK WOULDN'T YOU MAKE AN ALBUM WITH ALL PHOTOS INSTEAD OF DESCRIBING THEM WITH TEXT
I LOVE OLD-SCHOOL STAR WARS ARTICLE
THE SOUND QUALITY I'M KINDA HESITANT TO BUYING THESE BECAUSE PICTURE DISCS TEND TO SOUND WORSE THAN STANDARD RECORDS
I WANT ALL OF THIS
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MY OWN SET
I HAVE THEM TOO MY FAVOURITE IS OF COURSE THE DEATH STAR
HE'S USING THE ENCOUNTERS TO LEARN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE REBEL MINDSET
NO EVERYONE EITHER AGREES OR IS IN WAIT AND SEE MODE THIS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED A MILLION TIMES
HE WILL HAVE SOME VICTORY HE'S INTENTIONALLY LET THEM GO SO WE HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN HIM TRY HIS PRIMARY GOAL SEEMS TO BE WEEDING OUT SHITTY IMPERIALS FIRST
YEAH WHAT YOU'RE MISSING IS THE REST OF THE SEASON THE PAYOFF IS COMING
I AGREE THERE BETTER BE SOME HUGE PAYOFF AT THE END OF THIS WHERE HE JUST ABSOLUTELY DESTROYS THEM AFTER LEARNING ABOUT THEM IF NOT THEY'LL HAVE WASTES HIM THIS SEASON
THRAWN SAVED THE GALAXY FROM AN INVADING SPECIES FROM UNKNOWN VERY SMART DUDE
YOU STILL OWN A HOUSE PHONE ARE THESE THINGS REALLY STILL A THING
SEARCH YOUR PHONEBOOK YOU KNOW IT TO BE TRUE
PRAY I DON'T ALTER YOUR NUMBER FURTHER
DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF MY ANSWERING MACHINE
NO I AM YOUR LANDLINE
YOU ARE A PART OF THE REBEL ALLIANCE AND A TELEPHONE

SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT THE DIVORCE

OBLIGATORY S
YOU MARRY THAT WOMAN A SECOND TIME DAMMIT
I HOPE SHE DOESN'T HIT YOU ON THE HEAD WITH THE RECEIVER BECAUSE THAT'S TOTALLY WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME IF I TRIED THIS AWESOME PHONE THOUGH THE DARK SIDE APPROVES
CALL FOR PAPA PALATINE
I REALLY HOPE THIS ISN'T CUT FROM THE FINAL FILM
A SASSY DROID THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE AWESOME
I LOVE THE WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING WITH THIS

SHOULDN'T IT JUST BE A SINGLE IMAGE WITH A DISNEY LOGO AT THE BOTTOM

MADS MIKKELSEN IS BASICALLY A DISNEY PRINCESS NOW
LOVE THE DISNEY IS USING HERE ALMOST KINDA META BOTH PAGES ARE ADMINISTERED BY SAME COMPANY
YO HE MADS THO
TOO BAD THAT'S A PICTURE OF MIKKELSEN FROM STAR WARS CELEBRATION
LET'S HOPE HE'S NOT WASTED IN THIS
I LOVE THAT HE'S GETTING MORE AND MORE WORK HIM AND MENDELSON ARE PHENOMENAL ACTORS
THAT IS THE COOLEST FUCKING THING
R MARVELSTUDIOS
DOESN'T HIS BROTHER PLAY THRAWN
JUST TO BE CLEAR FOR ALL YOU NON-DANISH SPEAKERS WHEN PRONOUNCING FIRST NAME THE D IS SILENT WORDPLAY DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE IF YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD
THIS IS THE NEXT SCENE HETP
THIS MEAL IS GETTING WORSE ALL THE TIME
LANDO WHAT HAS TWO THUMBS AND JUST BETRAYED HIS BEST FRIEND

POINTS THUMBS AT SELF

THIS GUY TOO SOON
THERE WAS A SECOND CAMERAMAN


VADER SO UH HAN IS IT ARE YOU HAVING FUN WITH MY DAUGHTER

BOBA FETT KKK

VADER BOBA PLS
CAN ANY ULTRA NERDS IDENTIFY THE FOOD ON THE TABLE
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY THEY BOTHERED TO COOK FOOD AND SET THE TABLE IT'S NOT LIKE THEY GOT THEM TO SIT DOWN FOR DINNER BEFORE THE REVEAL THEY WERE ARRESTED AS SOON AS THE DOOR OPENED
MOST AWKWARD DINNER PARTY EVER
CAN WE GET A SPIN OFF MOVIE THAT IS JUST THIS DINNER IN REAL TIME
ONE OF MY MOTIVATIONAL WALLPAPERS HETP
OR AS MY KID CALLS IT MY STAR WARS ANNIVERSARY

SHE FIRST SAW A NEW HOPE LAST THANKSGIVING
VADER LOVES CHICKEN NUGGETS
AS LONG AS THEY HAVE BLUE MILK I'M IN
OK AM I WRONG IN THINKING FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE THAT THAT ROOM IS WEIRDLY SMALL FOR A FORMAL DINING HALL IT ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BIGGER EVEN FROM THE OTHER ANGLES
WHO BROUGHT THE POWERABLE BOTTLE
THIS WAS MY HOLIDAY CARD ONE YEAR GOT IT SIGNED BY LANDO

A

BW WAS FLATTERED HIS WAS THE ONLY FACE NOT PHOTOSHOPPED OUT
WHAT A WASTE VADER CAN'T EVEN EAT
PASS THE BLUE MILK
DAMN I SERVE THE SAME MEAL FOR LIFE DAY
VADER YOU CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER SWEETHEART HE'S A SCOUNDREL FOR GOD'S SAKE

LEIA BUT DAD I LOVE HIM

CHEWIE

VADER WHAT DID HE SAY

LEIA HE WANTS YOU TO PASS THE STUFFING

VADER REALLY

LEIA NUMBER HE'S PISSED YOU VOTED FOR TRUMP

LANDO CAN WE NOT DO POLITICS THIS YEAR PLEASE

VADER AT LEAST I DIDN'T VOTE FOR A CRIMINAL

LEIA ACTUALLY YOU DID HE'S ALSO AN UNHINGED RACIST XENOPHOBE AND PROBABLE RAPIST WHOSE SECOND IN COMMAND WISHES TO SEE GAY PEOPLE SUFFER BUT THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE

HAN IF IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THIS I'D HONESTLY PREFER TO BE FROZEN IN CARBONITE
EARTH DAY
LIFE DAY
INLAW SHOWS UP UNINVITED AND BRINGS OUT THE CARBONITE TAKEAWAY TRAY

SO WERE VADER AND HIS GOONS ACTUALLY SITTING DOWN AND ENJOYING A NICE MEAL
SPACE FOOD SO COOL
GOT ANY OF THAT BLUE MILK
OOOO I MEMBER
WHAT A WASTE OF FOOD I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR POLITICS ARE BUT PUTTING OUT A NICE SPREAD LIKE THAT JUST TO SURPRISE YOUR ENEMIES IS PRETTY ELABORATE IT'S NOT LIKE DARTH VADER ACTUALLY THOUGHT THEY'D COME IN AND SIT DOWN AND HAVE A MEAL WITH HIM DID HE

DID DARTH VADER JUST MAKE THEM A NICE DINNER AND HAN WAS BEING RUDE TRYING TO SHOOT HIM FOR IT
WHERE THAT BLUE MILK THO
WE HAD AN ANNUAL VIEWING OF A NEW HOPE AND EMPIRE

ICE CREAM WAS SERVED AT THE SIGHTING OF WILLOW HOOD AKA ICE CREAM MAKER GUY
I NEVER APPRECIATED THE TIME THAT WENT INTO THE TABLE SETTING BEFORE NOW I'M SURE THE GENERAL DIRECTION WAS FUTURISTIC NOT CLUTTERED STILL RECOGNIZABLE IN SOME ASPECTS

ALSO THEY PROBABLY KEPT KNOCKING STUFF OVER GETTING THE BLASTER RIGHT
PEW PEW
ILL TAKE THAT
CAN I GET SOME MORE WATER
DARTH BEEN SWIGGING A HIP FLASK
BOT BEEP BEEP I'M ALL ABOUT TOP POSTS

THIS POST HAD UPVOTES AND GOT POSTED TO TWITTER AND SUBREDDIT R REDDIN

THE TWEET



ALL UPVOTES ARE ON AND R REDDIN

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL POSTS ON AND R REDDIN
THIS LATER BECAME A FAMILY DINNER
FORGET THANKSGIVING HAPPY DAY
I AM ALTERING THE MEAL PRAY I DON'T ALTER IT ANY FURTHER
THAT ONE LOOKS DELICIOUS MIGHT HAVE TO TRY IT MYSELF MAYBE FOR CHRISTMAS
THIS IS BOTH HILARIOUS AND DELICIOUS YOU MUST BE HAVE BEEN POPULAR AT THE DINNER
STIR WHIP STIR WHIP WHIP WHIP STIR
OH FUUUUCK I HAD THIS COOKBOOK I NEVER USED ANY OF THE STICKERS THAT CAME WITH IT BECAUSE THEY WHERE TOO SPECIAL TO BE USED

WOOKIEE COOKIES FREAKING LOVED THE PICTURES IN IT
THIS COOK BOOK WAS MY JAM AS A KID I'VE MADE ABOUT EVERY RECIPE
I USED TO GET THIS FROM THE LIBRARY I MADE TIE FIGHTER TIES AND YODA SODA FOR MY FAMILY ONE SUPERBOWL SUNDAY
I NEED THIS COOKBOOK IN MY LIFE OME THE ABBA JIGGLE LOL
OH GOOD I WAS AFRAID I WAS THE ONLY ONE ON THE WORLD OWNING THAT UGLY ASS OF A ABBA ACTIONFIGURE
OH SHIT SON I STILL HAVE THIS COOKBOOK I'VE ONLY MADE 2 RECIPES FROM THE DANG THING BUT IT'S STILL FUN
I WOULD BE MAD IT NULLIFIES HIS ARC IN THE OT
LUKE GOING DARK RUINS EVERYTHING ABOUT HIS CHARACTER IT MAKES ZERO SENSE FOR HIM TO DO THAT
AN INTERESTING THEORY BUT ITS QUITE OBVIOUS THEY AREN'T HEADING IN THE DIRECTION PLUS I NEVER CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT FATHER WAS A PREVIOUS CHOSEN ONE BUT JUST A MANIFESTATION OF THE BALANCE OF THE FORCE AND HIS CHILDREN MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DARK AND THE LIGHT
I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT FFA IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES BUT LUKE TURNING TO THE DARK SIDE WOULD PROBABLY RUIN THE ENTIRE TRILOGY FOR ME LUKE ALREADY WON THAT WAR I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM FIGHT THAT BATTLE AGAIN
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING BUT I'LL BE MIFF THAT THEY KINDA WRECK CHARACTER
WELL I WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAN BOTH OF CHILDREN COULD BE BALANCED NOT A JEDI AND ISN'T TOTALLY NOBLE EITHER AND LUKE IS LIVING IN EXILE OUTSIDE OF THE JEDI ORDER
IT WAS MADE OBVIOUSLY CLEAR THAT THE FATHER ON MORTIS WAS THE CHOSEN ONE BEFORE ANAKIN

WAS IT THOUGH I'M NO STAR WARS GURU BUT I FIGURED ALL THAT MUMBO-JUMBO WAS THEM BEING APART OF SOME ANCIENT RACE AND RECOGNIZING ANAKIN AS BEING IMPORTANT AND THEREFORE TRYING TO HELP FUCK WITH HIM I DIDN'T REALLY GET THAT THERE WAS SOME MANTLE OF CHOSEN ONE BEING PASSED DOWN ALTHOUGH I GUESS IT HAS BEEN A WHILE

I ALWAYS TOOK THAT ARC AS BEING PROPHETIC AND HINTING TOWARDS THINGS WE KNOW WILL HAPPEN RATHER THAN BEARING ANY SIGNIFICANCE IN AND OF THEMSELVES
DELETED
NOT REALLY IT'S A MULTIPLAYER GAME FIRST AND FOREMOST
THE MULTIPLAYER IS ALRIGHT BUT IF YOU'RE ONLY INTERESTED IN SINGLE PLAYER THEN DO NOT GET IT WHAT LITTLE YOU CAN DO BY YOURSELF SUCKS AND IT'S BARELY ANYTHING
BATTLEFRONT AND SINGLE PLAYER


HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHA
THAT'S THE THING WITH BATTLEFRONT THERE IS NO SINGLE-LAYER SADLY
IN ALL HONESTY THE GAME IS A LET DOWN THEY NEED TO REMASTER BATTLEFRONT 2 ASAP
IT'S SHIT BIGGEST STAR WARS DISAPPOINTMENT SINCE MIDICHLORIANS
IT'S GOOD KINDA IT HAS AMAZING GRAPHICS AND KEEPS YOU ENTERTAINED FOR A BIT BUT IT GETS A BIT BORING IF YOU PLAY BY YOURSELF THE GAME IS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON MULTIPLAYER
SADLY IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAD A STROKE
REMINDS ME OF A PIRATE
TROOPER GRIT
ADD IN A NICE CLONE HELMET FIN AND THEN WE'LL BE TALKING
IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS AN EYE PATCH
OG STORM-TROOPER WILL ALWAYS BE BEST
THIS IS GREAT I LOVE THE ART STYLE
GOOD JOB WITH GIVING HER AND BB A WEATHERED LOOK LOTS OF SMALL DETAILS
GREAT IMPROVEMENT
REMINDS ME OF THE OLD CLONE WARS CARTOON
I'M TRULY NOT INTENDING TO SOUND EDGY OR ANYTHING BUT IS IT AN UNPOPULAR OPINION TO LIKE THE YUUZHAN VONG WAR
IT'S BEEN EXPLICITLY STATED THE YUUZHAN VONG WILL NOT BE ADDED INTO CANON
ACW CONCEPT ART FOR SEASON HETP
STARWARD IMAGES LATEST CB

THE STORYGROUP ARE MAKING NEW CONTENT LIKE THE NEVER FINISHED ANIMATED ACW EPISODES ARE CANON TOO AND PABLO RECENTLY SAID THAT EVEN THIS IS KINDA CANON TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT

I'D LOVE FOR THEM TO BE MENTIONED IN THE THRAWN BOOK

BTW THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THAT STORY
WHILE I DOUBT THEY WILL EVER SHOW UP IN THE NEW DISNEY CANON AS A FAN OF THE EU I WILL LOSE MY SHIT LAUGHING IF THEY EVER DO APPEAR AND BECOME CANON AGAIN ESPECIALLY AFTER ALL THE DISNEY CANON FANS CITING THEM SPECIFICALLY TO BASH THE EU THE YUUZHAN VONG AND ABELOTH ARE TWO OF THE BIGGEST SOURCES OF I CAN RECALL YET WE'VE ALREADY HAD THE REST OF FAMILY WITH THE MORTIS ARC WE HAD THE FATHER SON AND DAUGHTER THERE SHE'S THE MOTHER AND IF THE VONG WERE TO SHOW UP IT WOULD BE THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO GO THEY'RE CANON NOW
CONCEPT ART FOR ACW SEASON

CANON TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT
GOSH I HOPE NOT
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GAMES THE FORCE UNLEASHED AND THE SEQUEL WILL PROVIDE NON CANNON FUN A CLONE WARS ERA GAME OF SW REPUBLIC COMMANDO IS ALSO A CLASSIC AND I HIGHLY SUGGEST IT
TIMELINE OF CANON MEDIA

I RECOMMEND JUST GOING THROUGH THAT IN ORDER
I RECOMMEND GETTING IN THROUGH THE COMICS QUICK AND EASY TO CONSUME AND VERY ENTERTAINING
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN READING MORE OF THE NOVELS I FOUND ROGUE ONE CATALYST TO BE AS FAIRLY ENJOYABLE READ THAT PROVIDES SOME GREAT BACKGROUND FOR THE MOVIE I ALSO HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF LOST STARS FROM AN ENTIRELY NEW CHARACTERS STANDPOINT IT'S NOT A GREAT NOVEL BUT THE CHARACTERS ARE INTERESTING ENOUGH AND THE PLOT MOVES FAIRLY QUICKLY

IN TERMS OF REALLY ENJOYABLE COMIC SERIES I REALLY APPRECIATED THE STORY ARC TOLD OVER THE ANAKIN COMICS THE ARTWORK IS INCREDIBLE IN THOSE TOO AS SOMEONE WHO ALSO HAD NEVER REALLY CONSUMED COMICS BEFORE TRYING TO DEDICATE MYSELF TO GOING THROUGH ALL CANNON MEDIA I FOUND THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH IT WAS TO READ THE PAGE IN FULL AND THEN JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE THE DRAWINGS ON THE PAGE BEFORE MOVING ONTO THE NEXT ONE
IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST KOROR YOU'LL DEFINITELY LIKE KOROR 2
I FOR ONE THOUGHT KOROR 2 WAS MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST BOTH IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY AND STORYTELLING IT'S A LOT MORE COMPLEX

YOU COULD ALSO START READING THE NEW COMICS I JUST STARTED WITH THE VADER ONES AND IT'S FANTASTIC
HERE'S A GOOD CANON GUIDE WITH ALL THE NEW MEDIA HETP
KOROR II IS A BEAUTIFUL GAME EVEN BETTER THAN KOROR I BUT SADLY YES IT WAS RELEASED UNFINISHED

BUT FEAR NOT FANS FINISHED THE GAME AFTER IT WAS RELEASED AND THE SITH LORDS RESTORED CONTENT MOD NOW COMES ON KOROR STEAM RELEASE SO YOU CAN NOW PLAY KOROR II THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE PLAYED

IF YOU ALREADY OWN IT THOUGH YOU MAY WANT TO DOUBLE-CHECK THAT TSLRCM IS IN FACT INSTALLED
I WOULD PLAY KOROR 2 EVEN IF YOU CAN'T DOWNLOAD THE MOD TO UNLOCK THE EXTRA CONTENT THE CHARACTERS ARE PRETTY INTERESTING THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF OTHER STAR WARS GAMES ON STEAM OR GOG I PERSONALLY LOVED TIE FIGHTER AND REBELLION THE MOST

IF YOU WANT TO DIP INTO THE EU START WITH EITHER HEIR TO THE EMPIRE OR THE SERIES IN MY OPINION THEY AREN'T TOO WACKY LIKE SOME OTHER EU THINGS AND WILL HELP GIVE YOU A JUMPING OFF POINT THE WRAITH SQUADRON TRILOGY IN PARTICULAR IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT

THE BEST NEW CANON COMIC FOR ME WAS LANDO AND IT'S A SHORT RUN OF ONLY ISSUES I THOUGHT IT WAS EXTREMELY EXCELLENT AND ADDED A LOT TO MY NEXT VIEWING OF ESB

FOR NEW CANON BOOKS I'D SUGGEST READING LARKIN OR BLOODLINES NONE OF THE OTHERS REALLY IMPRESSED ME BUT I'M HOLDING OUT HOPE FOR FUTURE ONES
TRY THE CLONE WARS SERIES FROM

IF WE GOT TO REGAL AND WATCH IT IN THE RPM THEATER DO WE GET THE LIMITED EDITION TICKET

A LOT OF THESE ARE FROM THE COMIC VALERIAN AND LAURELING WHICH WAS TECHNICALLY MADE INTO THE FILM THE FIFTH ELEMENT AND IS ACTUALLY GETTING ITS OWN PROPER FILM NEXT YEAR
ITS WELL DONE BUT ITS JUST LIAM NEESON AT THAT POINT
R STARWARSTATTOO

THAT IS SOME QUALITY INK YOUR FRIEND IS VERY TALENTED
I LOVED ROB ROY TOO



JUST KIDDING WELL DONE
VERY FUNNY
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THE BLUEJAYS OR DVDS
DON'T MOCK JEDI MASTER STICK
JUDGE ME BY MY SIZE DO YOU
MAY THE PAWS BE WITH YOU
I TRIED MY BEST HETP
ONE DOES NOT LEARN THE WAYS OF THE FORCE IN ONE DAY IT REQUIRES LONG HOURS OF MEDITATION LIGHTSABER TRAINING AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SQUIRREL
NO CUPPER NO CUPPER YOU'RE THE CUPPER
IS THAT A CHIBA IND
KENOBI MASTER JEDI K
THESE ARE NOT THE BONES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
OBLIGATORY SNOKE JOKE HAH THAT RHYMES
CUTE JEDI THOUGH
WHAT'S A CUPPER
THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE
DOGGO WAN KENOBI
EPISODE XXXIIV THE WOOF AWAKENS GENERALLY AT TWO AM

USE THE FORCE AIR BUD USE THE FORCE

EPISODE XXII THE FETCH STRIKES BACK LET GO OF THE FRISBEE YOU MUST IF COMPLETE YOUR TRAINING YOU WILL GOOD BOY YOU ARE
COME TO THE BARK SIDE OF THE FORCE
LUMINOUS BEINGS ARE WE NOT THIS CUTE CUPPER
DOGGO DOES THE FORCE
YOU MISSED A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY JEDI
HAN CAPTURED CHEWIE LANDO LEIA AND DEAD AND DISMEMBERED VADER WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED BY LUKE WHEN LANDO FREED LEIA AND CHEWIE
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IF LUKE STAYED AND COMPLETED HIS TRAINING THAT WHEN HE FINALLY CONFRONTS VADER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING HIM BACK TO THE LIGHT WITHOUT ALSO GETTING HIM KILLED
LEIA WOULD BE TAKEN WITH VADER CHEWIE AND LANDO WOULD GO OFF TO RESCUE HAN AND PROBABLY FAIL LATER BADASS LUKE SKYWALKER SAVES EVERYONE WITH TWO GOOD HANDS THE END
A FULLY TRAINED LUKE WOULD BE ABLE TO BEAT VADER WHEN THEY FINALLY MET FACE TO FACE BUT WOULD VADER DISCOVER FORCE SENSITIVITY IF HE HAD PROLONGED CONTACT WITH HER AS HIS PRISONER IF HE DID THEN THE OTHER SKYWALKER WOULD ENTER THE EQUATION AND THE WHOLE GAME WOULD CHANGE
ALL HIS FRIENDS ARE DEAD EXCEPT MAYBE HAN WHO IS HELD CAPTIVE BY ABBA HE MAY NOT DEFEAT VADER SINCE VADER FOUGHT WITH NO CONVICTION AFTER LUKE BEGAN TO CHIP AWAY AT HIS DARKNESS ATTACHMENT IS WHAT SAVED VADER AND HIS FRIENDS ATTACHMENT IS WHAT YODA PREACHED AGAINST I DON'T KNOW THAT GOOD WOULD HAVE PREVAILED IF LIKE HAD LEFT HIS FRIENDS TO DIE AND STAYED WITH YODA IN FACT I'D SAY HE LIKELY WOULD HAVE TURNED TO THE DARKSIDE HIS BATTLE WITH VADER WOULD HAVE BEEN REVENGE FUELED AND THE EMPEROR IS STILL THERE TO PLAY WITH HIS MIND
BY THAT LOGIC SHAAK TI WAS KILLED BY GENERAL GRIEVOUS ABOVE CORUSCANT ONLY TO LATER BE KILLED IN THE JEDI TEMPLE BY ANAKIN THE WHOLE POINT OF DELETED SCENES IS THAT THEY'RE DELETED THEY DON'T COUNT THEY'RE NOT CANON

THAT BEING SAID I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE IF BIGGS IS IN ROGUE ONE OR NOT I JUST THINK THAT DELETED CONTENT IS A BAD BASIS FOR AN ARGUMENT
THE GUY WITH THE DARK MOUSTACHE IN THIS PICTURE SOURCE SURE LOOKS A LOT LIKE BIGGS SAME HELMET
THE DELETED SCENE ISN'T CANON
2 THE FACT THAT RED LEADER TAKES BIGGS WORD THAT LUKE IS WORTH FLYING ONE OF THEIR VERY RARE VERY EXPENSIVE FIGHTERS OVER SOMEONE ELSE WHO WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A KNOWN QUANTITY IS ODD IT MEANS BIGGS HAS EARNED A LOT OF TRUST YOU DON'T DO THAT IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS
YEAH WHILE THE TIMELINE OF THE DELETED SCENE WITH BIGGS ON TATTOOING WITH LUKE MEANS THAT HE PROBABLY ONLY JOINED THE REBELLION MINUTES BEFORE LUKE DID I MEAN REALLY ALL OF STAR WARS TAKES PLACE OVER THE COURSE OF A WEEKEND AND THE VERY NATURE OF DELETED SCENES MEANS THAT FILMMAKERS CAN BIGGS INTO THE NEW CANON ANY WAY THEY LIKE THAT OLD DELETED SCENE WAS SO NICE I'D HATE TO HAVE IT BE SUPERSEDED BY A RANDOM BIGGS CAMEO IN ROGUE ONE JUST FOR THE SAKE OF A QUICK MEMBER DIS NOSTALGIA HIT
I MADE THIS POINT ELSEWHERE AND WAS SHOT DOWN ON THE BASIS THAT THE DELETED SCENES AREN'T CANON BUT I AGREE WITH YOU
I SPENT HOURS DECORATING MY HOUSE HAVE REINDEER IN THE LAWN AND MY FIST THOUGHT WAS KIND OF SOON AFTER THANKSGIVING FOR CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS

BUT THAT LOOKS AMAZING ALL I HAVE FOR ORNAMENTS ARE AND JAR JAR
WOW THATS SICK
WE DON'T HAVE A TON OF ORNAMENTS SO WE ALSO TEND TO JUST PUT OUR NERD TOYS IN THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND CALL IT A DAY

GOOD JOB HAVE AN UNVOTE
HERE HOPE THAT THIS HELPS YOU

R STARWARSCANON WIKI INDEX


HOKEY RELIGIONS AND ANCIENT WEAPONS ARE NO MATCH FOR A GOOD BLASTER AT UR SIDE KID
IT'S TURNED INTO THE STAR WARS LITERATURE VERSION OF BREAKING BAD IF YOU GET WHAT I MEAN BUT READ THE AFTERMATH BOOKS BY CHUCK FENDIG THE THIRD ONE DOESN'T COME OUT UNTIL FEBRUARY SO YOU HAVE TWO GOOD READS UNTIL THEN
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC STORIES OR DO YOU WANT TO GO IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER WITH CANON STORIES
HOW DO YOU GUYS THINK THESE COMPARE TO ULTRA SABERS CAN ANYONE MAKE A COMPARISON VIDEO I'M NOT SURE WHICH TO GET
THEY'RE HONESTLY NOT BAD AT ALL AT NIGHT TIME MY DAUGHTER WAS REY FOR HALLOWEEN AND I BOUGHT HER ONE OF THE BLUE STARWARD BLADEBUILDER SETS HERS LOOKED OK AT NIGHT BUT NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD COMPARED TO THESE ONES WE SAW A BUNCH OF KIDS RUNNING AROUND WITH THEM AND BESIDES THE HILT THEY GLOWING BLADE WAS AWESOME AT NIGHT AND LOOKED SO MUCH MORE LIKE A STAR WARS LIGHTSABER
YOU MISSED THE CLEARLY RIPPED OFF HALO WARS SPARTAN ON THE SIDE
THOSE THINGS ARE AWESOME AND THEY'RE SUPER CHEAP SO YOU CAN BATTLE WITH THEM AND NOT WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT BREAKING THEM
VHS DVD OR BLURRY WHEN DID YOU GET THEM WHAT DOES THE COVER LOOK LIKE ALL OF THESE ARE IMPORTANT TO FIGURING OUT WHAT VERSION YOU HAVE BASED ON WHAT YOU DESCRIBED YOU HAVE A VERSION THAT WAS RELEASED AFTER I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY CONSIDER THE HAN SHOT FIRST ORIGINAL THE HOLY GRAIL VERSION BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AND PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH IT
WIKI

CHECK OUT DESPECIALIZE EDITION IF YOU WANT TO SEE A FAN RESTORATION OF THE ORIGINALS


IF THE CASES LOOK LIKE THESE THEY ARE THE LAST ORIGINAL RELEASE THESE DID HAVE THE AUDIO REMASTERIES FOR THX BUT THE VIDEO IS THE ORIGINAL CUTS

CAME OUT ON VHS AND LASERDISK AROUND
OR DIGITAL DOWNLOAD THE VERSION

DVD THE VERSION

VHS THE VERSION

THESE ARE OFFICIAL RELEASES MIND YOU YOU CAN FIND FAN MADE AND DVD VERSIONS OF THE VERSIONS AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OFFICIAL DVD RELEASES THAT HAVE THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS IN SHITTY QUALITY ON A SECOND DISCOURSE
THREATEN IT WITH A GUN
REMINDS ME OF BILL SONG

WATCH V
MASAO SHIMON ADDED LYRICS TO MECO DISCO VERSION OF STAR WARS THEME CANTINA BAND
CAN ANYONE TRANSLATE I NEED TRANSLATION
SO DOES THE ENGLISH VERSION HYPERSPACE HOOPLA
HOLY SHIT THOSE ARE SOME OLD SCHOOL JAPANESE LYRICS AND SOUND EFFECTS LYRICS ARE KINDA NICE THOUGH AND THEY DO KINDA WORK KINDA SO FRIGGING SOUTH
STAR WARS HAS ALWAYS BEEN BUILT ON ARCHETYPES OLD GREY HAIRED WIZARD BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS AND SO ON

IN SHORT I THINK LUCASFILM ARE VERY AWARE OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING
I'M EXCITED
JUST ANSWERING THE TOP QUESTION THE REST OF THAT STUFF I HONESTLY AIN'T GONNA READ

POSSIBLY WE SHALL SEE
THE ASIAN MARTIAL ARTIST COMPLETE WITH BO STAFF AND BLINDNESS

AS OPPOSED TO ALL OF THE WHITE PEOPLE DOING KENDO

THE QUIPPY DROID WHOSE JOB IT IS TO BE FUNNY THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME TO AND A CASUAL BADASS THROWS GRENADE THERMAL DETONATOR INTO TROOPERS BOOM POW EFFORTLESS NO ONE IN THEATER LAUGHS AT THE JOKE NO ONE REACTS TO THE GRENADE TOSS

THIS IS A FAR LESS COMMON THING THAN YOU ARE PRETENDING IT IS

JOHN WILLIAMS WILL NOT BE DOING THE SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS NO SHIT I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK THAT UP TO KNOW IN ADVANCE BECAUSE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FEELS MORE THAN ALADDIN 2 THE RETURN OF AFAR

WHAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD AWARD WINNING SOUND ON IT YET

ON A SIMILAR NOTE I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO LOOK THIS UP BUT LET'S GUESS THIS WILL ALSO BE THE FIRST STAR WARS FILM WITHOUT THE PERENNIAL DREW STRUZAN POSTER WHY AM I GUESSING I'M RIGHT ABOUT THIS GUESS BECAUSE I'M GUESSING THIS PRODUCTION HAS LESS THAN HALF THE BUDGET OF ANY STAR WARS FILM RELEASED IN THE LAST TWO DECADES

DREW STRUZAN ONLY DID A CONVENTION GIVEAWAY POSTER FOR FFA SO THIS POINT WAS JUST DUMB


DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE TO DOWNVOTE THIS TOO MUCH STUPID TO NOT

WELL THIS WAS THE MAIN POSTER FOR THE FORCE AWAKENS I SAW THIS VERSION BEING USED TOO LIKE AT ACL CHINESE THEATRE STRUZAN ONLY DID THE EXCLUSIVE ONE FOR THE EXPO HERE'S JUST HIS ART FOR THE POSTER WHICH HE POSTED ON FACEBOOK
YOU'RE PERFECTLY ALLOWED TO FEEL THAT WAY I AM PERSONALLY REALLY EXCITED FOR IT ONE THING I WANT TO CORRECT THOUGH THERE ISN'T A HOT FRENCH GUY IN THIS FILM BUT THERE IS A HOT MEXICAN DUDE THOUGH HIS NAME IS DIEGO LUNA
YOU'RE TRYING VERY HARD TO NOT LIKE IT IF THIS IS THE EVIDENCE YOU HAVE
YOU MUST HAVE A LOT OF TIME ON YOUR HANDS TO HATE SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AWFUL I THINK IT'S GOING TO NOT BE A MAIN SERIES STAR WARS MOVIE

BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

I PERSONALLY THINK YOU CAN'T HOLD IT TO THAT SAME STANDARD AS YOU CAN THE MAIN SERIES IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT GOING FOR THAT YOU CAN'T JUDGE METAL GEAR RISING BY THE SAME STANDARDS AS METAL GEAR SOLID

WILL IT NOT BE FOR EVERYONE ALMOST CERTAINLY
WILL I ENJOY IT PROBABLY
JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT IT'S NOT A STAR WARS MOVIE
IT'S AN A STAR WARS STORY MOVIE
OKAY I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU HERE IF YOU CREATE A THREAD WHERE YOU HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO HATE A MOVIE BEFORE HAVING SEEN IT IN A SUB DEDICATED TO THE FANDOM OF SAID MOVIE SERIES DOWNVOTES WILL COME HARD AND FAST ALSO CALLING ATTENTION TO RECEIVED DOWNVOTES WILL HAVE A POSITIVE FEEDBACK EFFECT ON THE AMOUNT OF DOWNVOTES YOU RECEIVE
DID YOU EVER HAVE HOPE FOR THIS MOVIE I AM ALMOST IN SHOCK AT HOW MUCH HATE YOU HAVE FOR A MOVIE THAT APPEARS IN ALMOST ALL PRODUCTS AND INSTANCES SO FAR AS WELL THOUGHT OUT I DON'T THINK EVERYONE WILL LIKE IT BUT I'M GOING INTO THIS LOOKING FORWARD TO IT IF YOU WALK INTO THAT MOVIE EXPECTING IT TO SUCK IT WILL NEVER MEET YOUR HIGH BAR

THE DIALOGUE HAS BEEN MUCH BETTER IN RECENT TRAILERS EVEN NEW DELIVERY OF THE EXACT SAME LINES AND YOU CAN'T USE CLEAR TRAILER CUTS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SCENES AS EVIDENCE OF A SHITTY MOVIE

EDIT ADDITIONALLY SOME OF THE LINES WE'VE SEEN FROM THE TRAILERS THAT YOU HATE ON ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY FUNNY THEY'RE CERTAINLY NO WORSE THAN SOME OF THE TRASH DIALOGUE FROM EVERY OTHER STAR WARS MOVIE

AWARD WINNING COMPOSER EVEN IF IT'S NOT JOHN WILLIAMS STILL A GREAT COMPOSER

I FEEL LIKE THIS HAS BE A TROLL POST NOTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE SCREAMS MADE FOR TV
DELETED
I TRUST DISNEY AFTER EPISODE
DO DOWNVOTES REALLY MEAN THAT MUCH
SOUNDS LIKE YOU MAY HAVE OUTGROWN STAR WARS

FROM YOUR RUN DOWN I'D RECOMMEND YOU SKIP IT MAYBE GIVE YOUR TICKETS TO A DESERVING KID
THERE IS NEITHER A HOT FRENCH GUY NOR ANY HEROIN IN THIS FILM IF YOUR WRONG ABOUT THAT MAYBE YOUR WRONG ABOUT SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL
WAS GOING TO JUST MOVE ON BUT ALEXANDRE DISPLAT IS DOING THE SCORE AND HE'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT I CANNOT WAIT FOR A STAR WARS SCORE BY HIM

ALSO YEAH IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HATE IT BECAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY DECIDED TO
FROM A STORY PERSPECTIVE I THINK DAVID PROWSE GAVE A GREAT PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATING SHOCK FROM VADER

TO VADER HE JUST OFFERED LUKE EVERYTHING HE HIMSELF EVER WANTED RATHER THAN ACCEPT THAT LUKE WAS WILLING TO KILL HIMSELF

EVEN A SITH PROBABLY NEEDED TO WALK THAT OFF FOR A BIT
VADER IS CALM COOL AND COLLECTED HE'S NOT GOING TO CHASE LUKE DOWN AFTER A DESPERATE ESCAPE ATTEMPT KEEP IN MIND VADER IS NOT WORRIED AT ALL ABOUT BEING OVER POWERED BY LUKE HE PROBABLY IS PERFECTLY FINE WITH LETTING THE NEWS ABOUT BEING HIS FATHER MARINADE IN HEAD AND TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM TO JOIN NEXT TIME
YEAH I FIGURED THAT VADER COULD SENSE THAT LUKE DIDN'T DIE AFTER MAKING HIS BLIND LEAP AND SO VADER SET ABOUT CAPTURING THE FALCON SO A LUKE DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO ESCAPE BESPIN AND B USE THE CREW AS BAIT TO LURE LUKE BACK OR IN THE VERY LEAST IF LUKE DID MANAGE TO ESCAPE BESPIN WITHOUT THE FALCON VADER COULD USE THE CREW AS LEVERAGE TO CONVINCE LUKE TO EVENTUALLY SURRENDER
HE PROBABLY FELT PRESENCE AS STILL BEING ALIVE AND ONCE HE GOT ON THE MILLENNIUM FALCON AND TOOK OFF INTO SPACE ONLY CONFIRMED IT PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS HE ORDERED THE HYPER DRIVE TO BE SABOTAGED AS A CONTINGENCY PLAN IF LUKE DIDN'T COME WITH HIM
THEY NEEDED TO STOP THE FALCON WHICH ESCAPED CLOUD CITY A FEW MINUTES EARLIER AND HAD THE HYPERDRIVE SABOTAGED BY OFFICERS HE ALSO PROBABLY REALIZED LUKE WOULD ESCAPE ON THE FALCON

HE KNEW LUKE WAS ALIVE LATER DURING THE CHASE AND WE KNEW FROM STAR WARS FORCE USERS CAN DETECT THE DEATH OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE GALAXY SO VADER PROBABLY KNEW LUKE SURVIVED THE FALL
LET'S NOT FORGET VADER REACHES OUT TO LUKE VIA THE FORCE AFTER HE IS RESCUED IN THE FALCON HE KNEW LUKE GOT AWAY AND WAS SAFE
BUT WE'RE PRETTY CERTAIN KALO ALSO HAS A HISTORY WITH REY

SPECULATION LAND
INTERESTING BUT THIS IS FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH FINN SINCE HE BETRAYED THE FIRST ORDER SO IT MAKES SENSE FOR HIM TO SCREAM TRAITOR IN ANGER AT THIS POINT REN HAS ALREADY MET REY BEFORE AND SURELY WOULD HAVE ALREADY CONFRONTED HER ABOUT BEING A TRAITOR IF HE DID INDEED THINK SHE WAS ONE

HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE BRO
KALO REN WAS REFERRING SOLELY TO FINN WHEN HE SHOUTED TRAITOR FINN AND KALO INTERACTION MIRRORED PREVIOUS BOUT WITH THE MELEE STORM-TROOPER APPARENTLY SOLDIERS WITHIN THE FIRST ORDER TOOK BETRAYAL VERY PERSONALLY REY WAS ALSO UNCONSCIOUS DURING THAT SCENE


I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT KALO SCREAMED TRAITOR SO VENOMOUSLY TO FINN IS BECAUSE THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY ENVIOUS THAT FINN MANAGED TO FIND THE COURAGE TO LEAVE THE FIRST ORDER KALO MESSED UP HIS CHANCE IN VII AND IS MORE PISSED OFF AT HIMSELF THAN ANYONE ELSE HE JUST TAKES IT OUT OF FINN BECAUSE HE'S WHAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN
YOU COULDN'T REALLY BE CERTAIN HE INTENDED THAT FOR FINN EVEN THOUGH THAT IS THE OBVIOUS ASSUMPTION

BUT WE'RE PRETTY CERTAIN KALO ALSO HAS A HISTORY WITH REY THAT SHE SEEMS UNAWARE OF THAT HISTORY

EHHHHHHHHH
READ THE NOVEL AND TREATMENT AND THEN HYPOTHESIS ON STUFF
WONDER WHAT A PIE FIGHTER WOULD LOOK LIKE
YOU ARE IN COMMAND NOW ADMIRAL
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL ME
EMPIERCE STRIKES BACK
DOES THIS MAKE FIN A DESERTER
SHOULDN'T THIS JUST BE A PICTURE OF A FORK
I AM THE PIE DESTROYER
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU REMOVE BENDABLE KNEES FROM YOUR FIGURES
THAT SCOUT TROOPER IS ABOUT TO HIT SOME SWEET JUMPS WITH THAT THING
IS THAT THE TOY YOU COULD PUSH THE BUTTON ON THE BACK AND IT BLEW UP
IT'S AN ACTION POSE HE'S KICK STARTING IT
LET'S GO BUTTS UP AND FAST
WHY DOES IT SAY IT COST NOTHING
WHY WERE THEY FREE
HOW DID YOU GET THEM DID YOU BUY THEM ONLINE OR AT A THEATER
WIKI LEGENDS

SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND SOME NEAT EU STUFF ON IT IF YOU LOOK AROUND
THEY HOLD CARGO IT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR SOME TIME NOW
EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID HAS BEEN CONFIRMED ALREADY AND WE'VE KNOW FOR MONTHS NO OFFENSE
PIC PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT THEY'RE CARGO TRANSPORTS WITH THE BROWN I CAN ONLY IMAGINE STANDS FOR ALL TERRAIN ARMORED CARGO TRANSPORT
THIS IS LIKE BIGGEST NITPICK I'VE SEEN
IN A NEW HOPE IS FULL OF HALF TRUTHS TO LUKE HE EVEN SAID THAT VADER KILLED FATHER I WOULDN'T HOLD IT PAST BEN TO BE WABBLY WOBBLY WITH HIS STATEMENTS
THE CONTINUITY ISSUES IN THIS SERIES ARE UNACCEPTABLE S
BUT IN EP THE TWINS ARE BORN AND I'M PRETTY SURE HE DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY RENOUNCE THAT NAME COME ON GEORGE

I DON'T THINK IT'S UNREASONABLE HE SWITCHED TO JUST BEN AS SOON AS HE STARTED ON TATTOOING IN WHICH CASE IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY SINCE THE NEW ERA IN WHICH HE CHANGED HIS NAME BEGAN BASICALLY THE DAY LUKE WAS BORN SO CUT THE OLD HERMIT MAN SOME SLACK

THAT'S ONE HELL OF A NITPICK IMO
I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS POST IS SERIOUS
DICTIONARY HYPERBOLE
I MAY BE WRONG HERE BUT USES THE NAME BEN IN THE CANON NOVEL DARK DISCIPLE
I DON'T THINK HE EVER RENOUNCES THE NAME AS SOON AS LUKE ASKS IF HE KNOWS HE SAYS HE'S ME

HE JUST STOPPED INTRODUCING HIMSELF AS
DID ANYBODY ACTUALLY CALL HIM AFTER LUKE WAS BORN IN ROTS
BEEN ON TATTOOING FOR YEARS BY THE TIME WE MEET HIM IN IV DO YOU THINK HE REMEMBERS EVERY SINGLE TIME HE'S BEEN CALLED OBI WAN OR BEN SINCE BIRTH
THE PREQUEL AREN'T KNOWN FOR KEEPING CONTINUITY WELL

BUT I MEAN THIS ISN'T A BIG DEAL AND EITHER WAY THAT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE I DON'T THINK ANYONE CALLS HIM AFTER LUKE IS BORN
THIS IS GENIUS I'M TOTALLY DOING THIS
WHERE'D YOU GET THESE AWESOME THINGS
WHAT GAME IS THIS
I'D RECOMMEND CHECKING OUT CASTING CALL CLUB YOU CAN POST A CASTING CALL FOR FREE AND HAVE INTERESTED ACTORS AUDITION FOR THE ROLES

BEST OF LUCK WITH THE PROJECT
DAMN I'VE BEEN HOPING FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN EVER SINCE I WATCHED BACKSTROKE OF THE WESTERN

WISH I COULD DO SOMETHING TO HELP BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY VOICE ACTORS

THE EASIEST WAY TO GET SOME HELP WOULD PROBABLY BE TRYING TO CONTACT THE GROUP WHO DID THE BACKSTROKE DUB BUT I'VE NEVER FIGURED OUT WHO THEY ARE OR WERE

THEY BEEN TALENTED THOUGH SINCE THEY MIMICKED THE ACTORS PERFECTLY ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE WAS YODA HAVING AN OLD WOMAN'S VOICE WHICH WAS ALSO IN A WORSE AUDIO QUALITY COMPARED TO THE REST

PERSONALLY I LIKE TO THINK IT WAS A GROUP OF VOICE ACTORS JUST HAVING A LOAD OF FUN IN THEIR SPARE TIME

I HOPE YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN AND AS I SAID I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO TO HELP
IT'S THE FIRST ORDER THEY'VE DONE IT
THA FAAAAHST ERDAH
ALL REMAINING SYSTEMS WILL BOW TO THE FIRST ORDER AND WILL REMEMBER THIS AS THE LAST DAY OF THE REPUBLIC
RIP BILLIONS OF PEOPLE WE NEVER MET OR REALLY CARED ABOUT YOU ACTUALLY WON'T BE VERY MISSED
I THINK YOU MEAN STARKVILLE BASE
HOW WAS THAT VISIBLE IN THE SKY OF AN OUTER RIM PLANET WHEN IT WAS BEING FIRED AT A PLANET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GALAXY THE MOVIE MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL IS IN THE SAME SYSTEM
I REALLY HOPE REBELS GOES TO THE BOSNIAN SYSTEM AND MAKES THIS HAVE AT LEAST A LITTLE MORE IMPACT
OH FUCK
WHAT IS THE THREAD FOR THE ORIGINAL PIC ON R EARTHBORN
I REALLY HOPE REBELS GOES TO THE BOSNIAN SYSTEM AND MAKES THIS HAVE AT LEAST A LITTLE MORE IMPACT
NOOOOOOO
THIS LOOKS MORE LIKE A VOLLEY OF PHOTON TORPEDOS THAN ANYTHING FROM STAR WARS TO ME
WHO FIRED THE PHOTON TORPEDOES
A COFDV

FOUND IT
THAT WEAPON WAS SUCH A STRETCH PUT A SOUR TASTE IN MY MOUTH FOR THAT FILM WHY DOES THE EMPIRE KEEP BUILDING INSANELY UNREALISTIC WEAPONS WHY WOULDN'T THEY HAVE INFILTRATORS PLACE BOMBS ON ALL THESE TARGETS AND THEN ACTIVATE THEM IT'S AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE
WELL THERE GOES THE BOSNIAN SYSTEM
THESE HAPPENED TO LINE UP PERFECTLY IN MY READER HETP
R EMPIREDIDNOTHINGWRONG
NEEDS MORE LENS FLARE
REMEMBER THIS DAY AS THE LAST DAY OF THE REPUBLIC
HEH REPUBLIC IS WEAK
THESE ARE SOME BADASS LASERS
RIP BOSNIAN SYSTEM
OH LOOK IT'S THAT ORGANIZATION THAT PRETENDS NOT TO BE THE EMPIRE BUT IS BASICALLY IDENTICAL TO IT
THE 2 GLOWING ONES ARE COMING FOR EARTH RIGHT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER LINES THEY AREN'T COMING FROM THE SAME SOURCE
SNIFF

IT'S JUST SO BEAUTIFUL
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WAS R SPACE AND I WAS JUST LIKE WTF DID YOU JUST DO
OP HERE L DON'T UNDERSTAND THE REFERENCE BUT THIS IS SUPER COOL EITHER WAY
THIS BELONGS IN R SHOPPEDSTARDESTROYERS
THAT'S DUMB
BOY OH BOY DO I HATE THE STARKVILLE
NEAT PICTURE THOUGH OP
I SOOSOO HATE THIS SCENE RUINS THE ENTIRE MOVIE FOR ME
I'M NOT VERY WELL VERSED WHEN IT COMES TO EMPIRE AT WAR I'VE ONLY PLAYED SOME
BUT I THINK YOU CAN DO REGULAR BATTLES IN NOT SURE ABOUT GALACTIC CONQUEST THOUGH
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY LUCAS ONCE SAID THAT IN UNIVERSE THE SURNAME SKYWALKER IS MUCH LIKE THE REAL WORLD SMITH
WHEN STAR WARS CAME OUT VADER WASN'T FATHER IT WASN'T EVEN MOST OF THE DRAFTS OF WHAT WAS THEN CALLED STAR WARS 2 CHECK OUT THE MAKING OF EMPIRE STRIKES BACK AND STAR WARS THE ANNOTATED SCREENPLAYS FOR BACKGROUND ON THE WRITING PROCESS

SO IN EMPIRE WE LEARN AS A TWIST THAT VADER IS FATHER

AND THEN SOME YEARS LATER THE PREQUEL CAME OUT AND PEOPLE STARTED ASKING WHY GIVING THE KID THE SAME NAME AND PLOPPING HIM DOWN IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT WHERE HIS DAD LIVED DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND IT DOESN'T BECAUSE GEORGE LUCAS CAN MAKE GREAT MOVIES BUT HE NEEDS PEOPLE TO EDIT HIS IDEAS
VADER WOULD NEVER GO TO TAT LOOKING FOR HIM BECAUSE HE HATES SAND IT'S COARSE AND ROUGH AND IRRITATING AND IT GETS EVERYWHERE
WHEN LUKE WAS TAKEN TO TATTOOING DIDN'T GIVE HIM TO HIS ACTUAL AUNT AND UNCLE IF SO NO ONE WOULD REALLY QUESTION HIS LAST NAME AS OF HIS MOTHER'S DEATH ANAKIN DIDN'T REALLY HAVE MUCH MOTIVATION TO GO THERE TOO MUCH PAIN
WHEN THE MOVIE WAS SHOT VADER DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A NAME AT THAT POINT IN LUCAS MIND HE COULD HAVE BEEN CALLED JOEY JUNIOR SHABADOO DURING HIS JEDI YEARS THERE WAS NO WEIRD HEADSCRATCHING MOMENT

ALSO THE SCENE IN THE SPECIAL EDITION HAS DIFFERENT NEW LINES WATCH THE THEATRICAL VERSION OF THE SCENE
GOT TO GO WHEN IT WAS IN MUNICH IT WAS TRULY AMAZING ESPECIALLY WITH MY WIFE AND BOYS HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR TIME THERE
THANKS FOR SHARING THESE AWESOME PHOTOS HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR TIME THERE
SO THAT MEANS POE AND SNOKE ARE IN THIS ONE RIGHT
I SHOWED MY GRANDMOTHER THE NEW TRAILER TODAY SHE THOUGHT AYN ERGO WAS REY

THIS PSA IS VERY USEFUL
BETHANKS WERE THE 2ND DEATH STAR HOW ARE AN ENTIRE SPECIES OF PEOPLE AN OBJECT
YOU KNOW A PSA LIKE THIS IS WASTED HERE RIGHT
I'M STILL WAITING FOR KYLE KATAR
I'LL LET YOU KNOW IN A FEW WEEKS
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW
PROBABLY A WILHELM SCREAM MAYBE A I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS
THERE ARE STORM-TROOPER SO I'M GUESSING YES TO THE WILHELM SCREAM WILHELM
I'M NOT EVEN CONVINCED THERE'S NO CRAWL I READ THE ARTICLE AND UNLESS SHE MADE OFF THE RECORD COMMENTS TOO THEY'RE READING WAY TOO MUCH INTO HER INTERVIEW

NOT SAYING THERE IS A CRAWL EITHER BUT I'M MORE
VADER ROCKS THAT CAPE
VILLAINS WEAR CAPES IT'S JUST WHAT THEY DO
THERE IS A PICTURE OF VADER WITHOUT HIS CAPE HE LOOKS LIKE ROYALTY VERY MUCH LIKE AN ANCIENT WARRIOR
I MEAN BLACK IS ALREADY A SLIMMING COLOR AND HIS SUIT IS PRETTY FORM FITTING I'M NOT SURE IF HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OMINOUS WITHOUT THE CAPE BUT HE SERIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN WAY SEXIER I MEAN VADER IS TALL AND LOOKS PRETTY JACKED NO HOMO
DEFINITELY WITH THE CAPE IT ADDS SO MUCH TO HIS IMPOSING IMAGE
LOL

THEY DIDN'T CHANGE AT ALL IN PORTUGAL
DO YOU DOOK
YES I DO DOOK
WE ALL KNOW DOOK WAS DTF
I'M SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE IT IN AMERICA FOR BEING AN OFFENSIVELY CRAPPY NAME
SAME GOES FOR JEDI MASTER ON EPISODE II HIS NAME IS PRONOUNCED WHICH MEANS FUCKS HIMSELF HERE IN BRAZIL PROBABLY PORTUGAL TOO DDK IT GOT CHANGED TO WITH THE OFFICIAL DUBBED AND SUBBED RELEASE
THERE'S ACTUALLY A SIMILAR ISSUE WITH KETU FROM REBELS

KETU CAN MEAN ASS ALONG WITH A FEW OTHER HOMOPHONES IN JAPANESE THEY'VE GOTTEN AROUND THIS BY EXTENDING THE U SOUND TO KETSUU IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE TO AN ENGLISH SPEAKER BUT VOWEL LENGTH IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT IN JAPANESE
COUNT I DO ANAL

NICE
HUH AFTER THE TOILET HUMOR WITH JAR JAR IN EPISODE I I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS BASED ON BOOKY
IN THE NETHERLANDS DOUKOU WHICH IS PRONOUNCED IN THE SAME MANNER IS SLANG FOR MONEY THAT WOULD MAKE IT A PRETTY GOOD RAP NAME
COUNT I DO ANAL
ON FFA ZAKKEU WAS CHANGED TO JACKMAN J CU MEANS ALREADY ASS WHEN TRANSLATED LITERALLY
MY ROOMMATE AND I ALWAYS SAID I NEED TO GO TAKE A COUNT DOOK EVERYTIME WE HAD TO SHIT WE JUST THOUGHT WE WERE BEING FUNNY DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE BEING SMART
NOT SW RELATED BUT THERE WAS A MOVIE YEARS AGO B COUNTY CIRC THAT ONE OF THE CHARACTERS WAS NAMED MOHA IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE DIE IN THE IMPERATIVE MORRA SO THIS GUY WAS FALLING OFF A CLIFF OR SOMEWHERE ELSE HIGH ENOUGH TO KILL A PERSON AND HIS FRIEND SCREAMED MOHAAAA SOUNDING LIKE HE WANTED HIM TO DIE
IT DOESN'T MEAN I DO ANAL

SOURCE AM PORTUGUESE IT ALSO DOESN'T MEAN THAT IN BRAZIL
FOR THOSE WONDERING CU MEANS BUTTOCKS IN EUROPEAN PORTUGUESE AND ANUS IN BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE IT'S A COGNATE OF THE FRENCH CUL OR THE SPANISH CHLO

HAIKUS IN BRAZIL ARE CALLED HAIKAI FOR THE SAME REASON
THIS HAPPENS ACTUALLY A LOT TWO EXAMPLES COME TO MIND MITSUBISHI PAJERO WHICH MEANS JERKER IN SPANISH AND NOKIA LUMIA MEANING PROSTITUTE BOTH HAD PROBLEMS WHILE INTRODUCING THEIR PRODUCTS IN SOUTH AMERICA
BOOKED IN THE BOOKER
SHOULD HAVE CHANGED IT IN THE SCRIPT IT'S THE DUMBEST NAME EVER
IT MEANS FROM THE ASSHOLE TO BE MORE SPECIFIC
WORKS IN FRENCH TOO DU CUL SOUNDS VERY MUCH LIKE DOOK AND MEANS FROM THE ASS AMAZING
COUNT BOOKIE
THAT'S KINDA WHAT IT MEANS IN ENGLISH TOO
COUNT DOKE EVEN SOUNDS BETTER THAN DOOK
BROWSING THIS TREAD IT SEEMS LIKE WHOEVER WAS COMING UP WITH THESE NAMES WAS BRAZILIAN AND IT WAS INTENTIONAL
DOOK IS A BIT OF AN ARSE
BOOKMAN ONE WHO DORKUS
SO NAME WOULD HAVE BEEN LORD BUTT FUCKER IF THEY'D LEFT IT
LOL
BOOK OF THE RINGS DEMON'S SERMON ON MARTIAL ARTS TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD THE ART OF PEACE THE ART OF WAR
WEAPON OF THE JEDI IS A GOOD CANON ONE IT DOESN'T HAVE A TON IN IT BUT IT GOES OVER HOW LUKE LEARNS TO MANIPULATE OBJECTS USING THE FORCE
I WOULD RECOMMEND READING SOME BOOKS ON KENDO LIKE LOOKING AT A FAR MOUNTAIN A STUDY OF KENDO KATA KENDO WAS WHAT INSPIRED MUCH OF THE LIGHTSABER COMBAT IN STAR WARS AND MANY OF THE PHILOSOPHIES OF KENDO WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE JEDI PERSPECTIVE ON COMBAT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND READING THE ACTUAL JAPANESE SOURCE TEXTS AS GOOD ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS WILL BE HARD TO FIND AND THEY WILL BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO DIGEST WITHOUT SOME GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF JAPANESE
THE DHARMA OF STAR WARS
START YOUR JOURNEY HERE
WIKI
R SHOWERTHOUGHTS
BUT IS THERE SOMETHING I'M MISSING

THE THIRD ACT OF A NEW HOPE
GENERAL DODONA SAYS IT IN ANH LITERALLY DAYS LATER THE REBELLION ARE KEEPING THE MEMORY OF THE JEDI ALIVE
HER MOTHER IN CATALYST SHE'S SAD WHEN ORDER HAPPENS SHE BELIEVES IN THE FORCE AND PROBABLY HAS EXPRESSED THAT TO AYN PLENTY WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD IN FACT THERE'S A TRAILER WHERE SHE LITERALLY DOES THIS
THE MYTHOLOGY OF THE FORCE STILL EXISTS DONNIE CHARACTER IS AN ADHERENT OF A SORT OF CHURCH OF THE FORCE AS WAS MOTHER KNOWLEDGE OF BELIEF IN THE FORCE PERSISTS EVEN WITHOUT THE JEDI
MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU IS A TRADITIONAL BLESSING IN MUCH OF THE GALAXY EVEN AMONG PEOPLE WHO AREN'T JEDI IT'S ESPECIALLY POPULAR WITH REBELS FOR WHOM THE JEDI ARE A SYMBOL OF OPPOSITION TO THE EMPIRE
I SORT OF TOOK IT TO BE THE MOTTO FOR THE REBELLION NON FORCE USERS BELEAVE IN THE FORCE AND IT'S SURROUNDING PHILOSOPHY THEY JUST CAN'T USE IT FOR VIOLENCE AND TRICKERY LIKE THE JEDI THOSE BELIEFS WOULDN'T SIMPLY VANISH BECAUSE THE MONKS ARE SEEMINGLY EXTINCT
I'M GUESSING THE MOVIE WILL HIGHLIGHT IT BUT HER MOTHER WAS A BIG BELIEVER IN THE FORCE PER CATALYST I IMAGINE THAT IS PASSED TO AYN
PEOPLE IN THE REBELLION USE IT ALL THE TIME A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT THERE WERE ORIGINALLY SOME JEDI THAT HELPED FOUND THE REBELLION
IT'S SORT OF LIKE SAYING GOD BLESS YOU OR YOU'RE OOOO GOOD LOOKING IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION
THE REBELLION USES THE SAYING ALL THE TIME SO DO MULTIPLE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE GALAXY IT'S NOT ACTUALLY AS RARE AS A SAYING AS YOU'D THINK THINK OF IT AS PEOPLE WHO CURSE WITH JESUS CHRIST OR GODDAMNIT IT MAY HAVE ORIGINATED FROM EUROPEAN RELIGION BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO INHERENTLY BE RELIGIOUS OR KNOW A RELIGIOUS PERSON IN ORDER TO SAY IT

PEOPLE IN ACW AND SW REBELS USE THE SAYING ALL THE TIME AS WELL IT'S BEEN A POPULAR SAYING FAREWELL SINCE THE OLD REPUBLIC ERA RANDOM CITIZENS THROUGHOUT KOROR AND SSTOR USE THE SAYING AS WELL SO IT'S MOST LIKELY NOT SIMPLY AN INNER CIRCLE PHRASE
AWESOME THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE RESPONSES
I JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS PRONOUNCED TAG
YOU CAN NEVER KNOW WITH THESE THINGS I ALWAYS LIKED

CASSI TAGGE SOUNDED COOL
TAGAL
I THOUGHT IT WAS TAHA
I ALSO PRONOUNCED IT AS TAJ AS IN THE LETTER G IS A SOFT G

DOESN'T ANYONE KNOW OF SOME AUDIOBOOK OR SOMETHING WHERE IF PRONOUNCED TAGGE
TAAAAAG HARD A
NOT SURE WHY BUT I READ IT TAJ AY LIKE TAJ MAHAL
ARG
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF HOW I'M A LINGUISTICS NERD BUT I PRONOUNCE IT TAGGUH LIKE IT'S GERMAN
I'VE ALWAYS ASSUMED IT'S
HEY I'M GOING TOMORROW DO YOU KNOW IF THE COSTUMES ARE ACTUALLY OR JUST RECREATIONS
FUN FACT ABOUT THAT COSTUME IT'S ACTUALLY THE RETURN OF THE JEDI SUIT AND GAUNTLETS WITH THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK HELMET THERE ARE DISTINCTIVE DIFFERENCES IN ATTIRE BETWEEN THE TWO FILMS I BELIEVE THE ROTC HELMET AND SOME OF THE ESB PIECES ARE LOST OR NO LONGER IN POSSESSION
THERE RIGHT NOW
IS THERE AN THERE
SWEET
ISN'T THIS PICTURE JUST STRAIGHT FROM THE WEB MARKETING
AT SOME POINT AKBAR REALIZED IT WAS A TRAP
REBEL SCUM TURN ON EACH OTHER AFTER CONSUMING LARGE AMOUNTS OF NARCOTICS

THIS IS GOING STRAIGHT TO R EMPIREDIDNOTHINGWRONG
I KNEW THAT THE SITH LETTUCE MAKES PEOPLE VIOLENT
WELL THAT TOOK AN UNEXPECTED TWIST
THE SHITPOSTS STRIKE BACK
WATCH OUT FOR FEDS IF YOU'RE US BASED JUST BECAUSE A STATE DOESN'T ENFORCE FEDERAL LAWS DOESN'T MEAN THE FEDS WON'T
THIS IS GREAT LOL WELL DONE
BEST THING EVER LOL
TOOK THIS BEFORE THE VII PREMIERE
DPA

IF YOUR A STARS WARS FAN YOU WILL LIKE IT IF YOU EXPECT IT TO BE AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL YOU MAYBE DISAPPOINTED I PERSONALLY LOVE IT BUT DO FEEL IT'S SHORT ON CONTENT
AS MUCH AS I LIKE THE GAME I'D HAVE GONE TO SEE FANTASTIC BEASTS AGAIN BUT IT'S NOT LIKE EITHER OF THEM IS GOING ANYWHERE SO HAVE FUN I'M REALLY STOKED FOR THE ROGUE ONE DLC
I HOPE YOU'RE READY TO BE DISAPPOINTED
YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE GAME IS HITE
AHEM

THE CORRECT LYRICS ACCORDING TO BILL MURRAY AKA SMOKES CONFIRMED

OH STAR WARS
NOTHING BUT STAR WARS
GIVE ME THOSE STAR WARS
DONT LET THEM END
OH STAR WARS
IF THEY SHOULD BAR WARS
PLEASE LET THESE STAR WARS
STAY
AND HEY HOW BOUT THAT NUTTY STAR WARS BAR
CAN YOU FORGET ALL THOSE CRAZY CREATURES IN THERE
AND HEY DARTH VADER IN HIS BLACK AND EVIL MASK
DID HE SCARE YOU AS MUCH AS HE SCARED ME
OH STAR WARS
THOSE NEAR AND FAR WARS
OH STALLAR WAAAAAAARS
YEP NOW I HAVE IT IN MY HEAD
WELL DUH
BUT IT'S NOT EVEN RIGHT
AND THE GRAMMY FOR BEST SONG LYRICS GOES TO
WELL DUH
I WANT A GAME LIKE STAR CITIZEN FOR STAR WARS STAR CITIZEN IS BASICALLY REBEL GALAXY BUT MUCH MORE
EH IT'D NEED MUCH MORE DEPTH REBEL GALAXY IS REALLY DULL
THE WERE FLYING SUPPORT FOR THE TRANSPORT EVACUATION
MAYBE WEATHER TEMPERATURE IS ONE THING SINCE SPACE IS COLD AND EVERYTHING BUT PERHAPS SNOW AND ICE SCREW WITH THEM IT TOOK AWHILE FOR THEM TO GET SPEEDERS ADAPTED MAYBE THEY DIDN'T GET TO THE FIGHTERS IN TIME
PRETTY MUCH WHAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN SAYING THE WERE NEEDED FOR EVACUATION PURPOSES AND COULDN'T BE USED IN THE BATTLE THE HOTH BASE WASN'T THAT BIG THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE NUMBERS TO FIGHT AN ENGAGEMENT AGAINST THE EMPIRE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AN ENTIRE FLEET OF STAR DESTROYERS HAD FOUND THEIR LOCATION AND ONLY BY LUCK WERE THEY ABLE TO DEPLOY THE SHIELD TO PROTECT AGAINST BOMBARDMENT IF THE REBELS DIDN'T EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY THEY'D BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VASTLY SUPERIOR NUMBERS DEATH SQUADRON COULD FIELD ONCE THE SHIELD WENT DOWN THERE WAS NO MORE TIME THE ONLY THING KEEPING THE BOMBARDMENT AT BAY THEN WAS PERSONAL QUEST TO TRACK DOWN LUKE AS SOON AS VEERS DESTROYED THE GENERATOR THE FLEET COULD HAVE EASILY OPENED FIRE AND ANNIHILATED THE ENTIRE BASE AS SUCH THE REBELS HAD TO FOCUS ON ESCAPING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE BATTLE WASN'T MEANT TO BE WON IT WAS A HOLDING ACTION TO KEEP THE IMPERIALS BACK WHILE THE TRANSPORTS ESCAPED THE LIMITED NUMBER OF FIGHTERS AVAILABLE WERE NEEDED TO ESCORT THEM OUT PAST THE BLOCKADE FAR BETTER TO USE THE COLD SNOWSPEEDERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BATTLE

PERSONALLY I FEEL THE SIMPLY COULDN'T BE ADAPTED TO COMBAT EFFICIENCY IN THE EXTREME COLD WEATHER OF HOTH IN TIME FOR THE BATTLE THE SNOWSPEEDERS ARE INTENDED FOR ATMOSPHERIC OPERATIONS AND THEY ONLY JUST GOT ADAPTED IT'S ONE THING TO FLY YOUR FIGHTER THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE WAY TO SPACE IT'S ANOTHER THING TO GET INTO A PITCHED BATTLE WHILE STAYING LOW ALTITUDE THERE WAS SOME REASON THE SNOWSPEEDERS WERE A BETTER CHOICE THAN THE FOR THE BATTLE WHILE THE COULD HAVE DONE A STRAFING RUN AGAINST THE WALKERS EVERY MINUTE THEY SPENT FIGHTING WAS MORE TIME THE TRANSPORTS HAD WITHOUT ESCORT
I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS THE REASON THAT LEGENDS IS NO LONGER CANNON THE EXTENDED UNIVERSE GOT SO STUPIDLY BIG THAT SOMEONE COULD ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO BACK UP ANY ARGUMENT AS FOR ROGUE ONE THE ONES IN THE TRAILER WERE CONFIRMED TO BE WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR HOW EASILY THEY SEEM TO GO DOWN I MAINTAIN THAT FIGHTER WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SNUBFIGHTERS
THE ANSWER IS THAT IT WAS TOO COOL TO BE IN THE MOVIE CLIMATE IS SO COLD THAT IT ACTUALLY HAS A DELETERIOUS EFFECT ON SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS BRIEF FLIGHTS LIKE TAKEOFF AND LANDING ARE FINE BUT PROLONGED OPERATION WILL RESULT IN SOMETHING IMPORTANT FREEZING OVER AND YOUR SHIP CRASHING

FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY COULDN'T ADAPT THE PROPER FIGHTERS TO THE COLD SO THEY DECIDED TO DO IT WITH AIRSPEEDERS INSTEAD
CHEAP DOESN'T GENERALLY GO HAND IN HAND WITH MEETING IMPRESSING MODELS AND FAMOUS ACTRESSES

I DON'T MEAN TO BE HARSH HERE I'M JUST SAYING YOU PAY FOR QUALITY
SORRY TO POKE A HOLE IN YOUR LOGIC BUT THE ACTORS WILL BE USED TO WORKING WITH THE ACTUAL COSTUMES SO ANYTHING YOU MAKE WILL EITHER BE EXACTLY AS GOOD AS THAT IE AVERAGE TO THEM OR WORSE
WELL THAT QUESTION IS GOING TO BE FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER
NO STORM-TROOPER COSTUME WILL IMPRESS THE BABES
WELL GIRLS WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR FACE SO NO STORM TROOPER COSTUME AND THE GOOD ONES COST LOTS OF ANYWAY
I'M GONNA QUOTE COMMUNITY HERE

GIRLS LIKE TO DATE AND BE WITH MEN NOT REMINDED OF WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR LITTLE BROTHERS TO A CONVENTION
TRY BEING A DEATH TROOPER IT MIGHT MAKE YOU LOOK TALLER
STORM-TROOPER COSTUME

IMPRESS BABES

YOU DONT NEED A STORM-TROOPER COSTUME JUST GO SEE THE MOVIE WITH YOU MOM AND HAVE YOUR MOM TELL ALL THE BABES HOW GOOD OF A CATCH YOU ARE IT'LL WORK BETTER THAN ANY COSTUME
HAN POV
I THINK IT'S JUST SHADOWS
AS ANDROKTONE SAID IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FROM FIRST PERSON VIEW THROUGH EYES
ITS NOT DARK HAS HE SEEN CLONE WARS GENOCIDE BIOLOGICAL WARFARE CHILD SLAVERY TORTURE AND OTHER WAR CRIMES ARE PROMINENT THROUGHOUT IT
I THINK ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF STAR WARS IS THAT IS DOESN'T VEER TOO FAR INTO BEING HEAVY OR DARK TOO OFTEN AND WHEN IT DOES IT IS USUALLY OFFSET WITH SOME BIT OF LEVITY

THERE IS PLENTY OF FANTASTIC AND SUPER DARK FANTASY AND SCI-FI OUT THERE ALREADY STAR WARS IS KIND OF IT'S OWN THING AND IT SHOULD STAY THAT WAY
IMO STAR WARS SHOULD BE FOR EVERYONE YOUNG AND OLD
STAR WARS IS LIKE SUPERHEROES IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE OF ALL AGES LITTLE KIDS CAN WATCH THE FUN ADVENTURES OF REBELS ON DISNEY XD WHILE THEY CRACK JOKES AND SLOWLY BUILD UP A COOL FLEET WHILE ADULTS CAN READ ABOUT THE EXPLOITS OF DARTH BANE WHERE HE LITERALLY CRUSHES PEOPLES HEADS INTO THE GROUND WITH HIS BOOTS AND MURDERS CHILDREN WHILE MAKING A FATHER WATCH EVENTUALLY WE MIGHT GET SOMETHING OF THE LATTER ON NETFLIX IN THE FORM OF A TELEVISION SHOW

MARVEL IS ALREADY DOING IT WITH SHOWS LIKE DAREDEVIL WHICH ARE FAR DARKER THAN THE MARVEL FILMS BUT THEY TAKE PLACE IN THE SAME UNIVERSE ON ONE SIDE YOU HAVE CUTE BABY GROOT DANCING TO MICHAEL JACKSON ON THE OTHER YOU HAVE A RUSSIAN GANGSTER GETTING SLOWLY DECAPITATED BY HIS HEAD REPEATEDLY BEING STRUCK BY A CAR DOOR

I'M NOT SAYING IT WILL HAPPEN BUT THE SAME KIND OF STUFF COULD HAPPEN WITH STAR WARS JUST NOT ON THE BIG SCREEN IT'S ALREADY DARKER IN THE BOOKS AND COMICS CANON ONES INCLUDED STAR WARS IS A MALLEABLE PROPERTY
WHOLE STAR WARS UNIVERSE TARGETS TO MUCH OF THE CHILD DEMOGRAPHIC

ANH AND ESB DON'T DO THAT THIS IS KIND OF OFF TOPIC BUT I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO STRESS THIS WHENEVER SOMEONE CALLS STAR WARS A CHILDRENS SERIES IT WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS
OH I NEED THESE FOR MY GOD DAUGHTER WHERE CAN I GET THEM
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL PLEASE TELL ME I CAN GET THEM SOMEWHERE I NEED TO SEE MY BOYFRIENDS FACE WHEN HE OPENS THESE
THAT WALK AYN HAS WHEN SHE IS WALKING TOWARDS THE BRIDGE WHERE THE TIE MEETS HER IS SO SEXY
ALSO A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED I WATCHED THIS THEY GAVE TOO MUCH AWAY THAT THE SHAKES OFF THE RPG SHOT JUST TO BE DESTROYED BY AN X WING

BUT HOORAY FOR THE SOUND THAT WE HEARD FOR 2 SECONDS WHEN DAK GOT CRUSHED
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS AUDIO QUALITY
I THINK THIS IS A HIGHER QUALITY VERSION OF THE SAME TRAILER STILL NOT REALLY HD THOUGH

WATCH V AVD
DAMN I WISH I DIDN'T WATCH THAT OH WELL I GUESS IT'S TIME TO STOP TUNING IN CTA GUYS ON THE OTHER SIDE
WE'VE ANSWERED QUESTION ABOUT STORM TROOPERS FITTING TOILETS ARE WE GOING TO SEE ANY OTHER INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN THIS FILM
GONNA DIIIIIIIIIIIIE
THAT AUDIO JESUS
BUNCH OF DEAD MEATBALLS AND ONE JUNKYARD WELP
I LIKE HOW IS GETTING SOME MORE SCREEN TIME HE'S GOT ATTITUDE
THANKS FOR THE POTATO QUALITY
TICKETS
WHEN DID BOBA LOSE HIS LEG
NOW ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS A MAGNIFICENT THEMED MOVIE WITH BOBA FETT AND DENAR AS RUNNING BUDDIES
NOW I REALLY WANT A WESTERN STYLE STAR WARS FLICK

ALIEN SPACE COWBOY LASER GUN FIGHTS WITH STAR WARS CHARACTERS

DEAR GOD THAT SOUNDS AMAZING
HANDS TO BANANAS THE THIRD STAND ALONE STAR WARS MOVIE WILL BE MANDALORIANS V JEDI
HIS JOURNEYMAN PROTECTOR DAYS WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GO LEGIT AND HAVE A FAMILY IT WOULD BE DEATH WISH MEETS UNFORGIVEN
I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE DISNEY WOULD MESS IT UP BY TRYING TO EXCESSIVELY EXPLORE HIS PAST OR SOME OTHER DETAIL WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW

OTHERWISE I THINK A GOOD IDEA WOULD BE TO HAVE HIM ESCAPE THE SARLAC AND TRY TO FIND A WAY OFF TATTOOING PRESUMED DEAD FOR MONTH NO CREDITS LEFT SHIP TAKEN AWAY CRIMINALS WANT HIM DEAD PROBABLY HAS TO WORK FOR THE EMPIRE AS THEY HUNT SMUGGLERS AND REBELS ACROSS TATTOOING
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE THE MANDALORIANS AS PROPER WARRIORS AGAIN I LOVED TRAVISS PORTRAYAL OF THEM AND STILL DESPISE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CLONE WARS IT'S A SAD DAY FOR A AMANDO FAN WHEN DEATH WATCH IS THE MOST MANDALORIAN OF ALL THE BANDOS WE SEE
I THINK THERE IS ONE IN THE WORKS THE PLAN I BELIEVE IS TO SEE HOW THE HAN SOLO SOLO MOVIE GOES BEFORE THERE IS A SERIOUS COMMITMENT SOMEWHERE ON IADB I THINK I READ IT JUST LIKE THE YODA SOLO MOVIE IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE FUTURE
TOO BAD WE LOST THE GRIZZLED AND TOUGH WESTERN ACCENT FROM THE ORIGINAL AND NOW HAVE LESS THREATENING MORRISON VOICE
REBEL SCUM
I ADMIT I REALLY LIKE THE ALLIANCE INSIGNIAS ON THE SIDE
NO WONDER HE IS SO ROUND
PUMPKIN PIE IS TERRIBLE
ITS HERE
REWRITING YODA AS A STONER IS GREAT BECAUSE IT OFFERS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT EXPLANATION FOR WHY DAGOBA IS SO FOGGY
WE'RE HEADING TO CLOUD WORLD TO GET SHITFAAAAAAAACCEED

I LOVE THESE SO MUCH
JEDI PARTY WAS GLORIOUS
MY LONGEST YEAH BOY EVER
AURALNAUTS ARE A NATIONAL TREASURE
THAT SANTA IS ONE OF THE MOST TERRIFYING FUCKING THINGS THAT I VE EVER SEEN
OOOH A FACE EATING CONTEST
LADIES LOCKER ROOMS DUKE
I LOVE YOU

I LIKE YOU
YOU PROMISED ME FLESH
BASED AURALNAUTS
DJ DOOK AND THE AIRHORNS I'M FUCKING DONE
DAMN IT I CAN'T WATCH IT TILL TONIGHT
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT S CREEPIE COMMERCIAL AND CAN YOU MAKE THAT NEXT
THIS IS JUST AMAZING IT'S A WORK OF ARTICLE
VADER HOLOGRAM
IT'S ABOUT TIME THIS CAME OUT YOU FRAUD HACKS
YES
IF YOU'RE SEEING IT IN REAL IMAX YES OTHERWISE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND JUST SEE IT REGULAR
I HAVE ENJOYED IMAX MOVIES AND DOCUMENTARIES FOR DECADES A FEW YEARS BACK I TOOK A FRIEND TO SEE STAR TREK ON IMAX AND HE WAS ON THE EDGE OF HIS SEAT THE ENTIRE TIME HE LOVED IT

WE WILL BE SEEING ROGUE ONE ON IMAX DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
I'M BIASED IMAX IS COOL BUT I FIND IT FRUSTRATING TO LOOK BACK AND FORTH WHILE WATCHING SOMETHING ON THAT SCREEN IT TAKES AWAY A LOT FOR ME BIGGER ALWAYS ISN'T BETTER LOL
IT'LL BE BIGGER AND LOUDER BUT ULTIMATELY YOUR OPINION OF THE MOVIE PROBABLY WON'T BE SWAYED BY WHAT FORMAT YOU SEE IT IN

PERSONALLY I ONLY GO TO IMAX MOVIES BECAUSE I CAN RESERVE MY SEAT
I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET
YES YES AND YES I'VE WATCHED THE FORCE AWAKENS IN IMAX TWICE IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT BOTH TIMES AND I WISH I HAD MADE THE TIME TO WATCH IT IN IMAX ANOTHER TIME NORMAL SCREENS ARE NICE BUT THEY'RE DEFINITELY NOT IMAX
I SAW FFA IN IMAX AS A SECOND SHOWING I REALLY ENJOYED IT PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE SOUND SYSTEM
WOULD BE COOL TO SEE HIM THOUGH I IMAGINE THEY MIGHT CHANGE HIS STORY AND IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SIMON PEGG AHAH
IF DENAR IS IN IT SIMON PEGG HAS TO PLAY HIM
I DON'T THINK IT'S OFF THE TABLE
NOT MANY PEOPLE HERE WILL BE COSPLAYERS YOU MIGHT GET A BETTER RESPONSE FROM THE DEDICATED COPLAY SUBS ON REDDIN

MY BEST SUGGESTION IS CARDBOARD THIS IS WHY I'M NOT A COSPLAYER
YOU CAN DO A LOT WITH CORRUGATED CARDBOARD AND SPRAY PAINT ESPECIALLY WITH A PIECE LIKE THAT THAT'S MEANT TO LOOK A LITTLE MORE RUGGED RATHER THAN SOMETHING SHINY LIKE STORM-TROOPER ARMOR
LEIA I AM THE IMPERIAL SENATE

ISN'T SHE SUPPOSED TO PULL OUT A RED LIGHTSABER AND DO THE SHEE SPIN NOW
YOU HAVE NO CONFIDENCE YOU ARE DISGUSTING

ME TOO THANKS
C STAYING TRUE TO THE SKYWALKER FAMILY TRADITION HETP
FEAR OF THIS STATION WAGON

THE DEATH CAR IS A VERY POWERFUL WEAPON
ALWAYS KNEW ZUCKERBERG WAS WORKING FOR THE EMPIRE
I'M STILL PISSED THAT HILARIOUS TRANSLATION DIDN'T WIN BLANK OF THE MONTH THESE ARE FANTASTIC
I'M BEING TORN APART

O AHI MARK
I DO NOT WANT THESE TO END
I REALLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FUCK

LIAR WE'VE ALL SEEN THIS
LITERAL TEARS COMING OUT OF MY EYES THANKS FOR THIS I NEEDED A GOOD LAUGH
OH GOD JUST LIKE BACKSTROKE THIS IS PERFECT

IS THERE A COLLECTION OF ALL SEVEN IN A SINGLE LIST
HERE IS THE ENTIRE SUBTITLE FILE

WE ARE STARTING A DUBBING PROJECT PLEASE HEAD OVER TO R THEDUBGATHERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO HELP WITH DUBBING THESE SUBTITLES
WE BE FUCK DIE
IS THERE ANY CHANCE YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO SEND ME THE ENTIRE TRANSCRIPT I'M IN A THEATRE PROGRAM AND HAVE FRIENDS THAT WOULD LOVE TO DUB THESE LINES OVER THE ENTIRE FILM

EDIT JUST SAW THAT YOU'LL BE DUBBING THEM YOURSELF
THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST TRANSLATION SO FAR
AGAIN WITH A DAY AFTER THE FAIR I WONDER HOW IT'S TOO LATE TURNS INTO IT

I CAN KIND OF SEE HOW COVER ME BECAME ZUCKERBERG BUT WOULDN'T THAT MEAN THE TRANSLATION PROGRAM WAS WORKING WITH THE SOUNDS AS OPPOSED TO FINDING A TRANSLATION TO THE WORDS COVER ME
WHO IS SHE SHE IS VERY SEX APPEAL

LUKE NOT MINCING HIS WORDS THERE
ANY IDEA WHEN THE FULL SUB VERSIONS ARE COMING OUT
OH MY GOD EASILY THE HARDEST I'VE LAUGHED ALL DAY THANK YOU
TRAITOR HETP
WHAT'S YOUR PROCESS IN MAKING THESE SUBTITLES I'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO SOME FOR OTHER MOVIES
EWAN MCGREGOR AS WHILE IN EXILE ON TATTOOING MAYBE IN SOME SORT OF PLOT TO PROTECT A YOUNG LUKE WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING ABOUT IT
KENOBI

BOBA ANGO FETT

ASOKA TANO

COUNT DOOK

PALATINE DARTH SIMIOUS

LANDO CALRISSIAN

ORDER SURVIVORS

OLD REPUBLIC SERIES

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY

CREATE NEW CHARACTERS

IT'S GONNA GET REAL OLD REAL SOON IF ALL WE GET ARE SPINOFFS OF CHARACTERS WE ALREADY KNOW
THE SANDPEOPLE
A NEW CHARACTER STORY
WE DON'T NEED MORE ORIGIN STORIES I DON'T WANT STAR WARS TO BE MARVEL
KENOBI AND BOBA FETT SEEM LIKE OBVIOUS CHOICES BUT BEYOND THAT MAYBE DO SOMETHING NEW LIKE ROGUE ONE IS DOING WITH DIFFERENT BRAND NEW CHARACTERS I THINK I'D PREFER THAT OVERALL

ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T SAY NO TO A MOVIE FOCUSED ON ROGUE SQUADRON
I'D LOVE TO SEE A MOVIE ABOUT JEDI ACADEMY AND THE FALL OF BEN SOLO IT'S NOT POSSIBLE WIT THE ACTORS AT THEIR CURRENT AGES BUT PERHAPS THEY COULD ANIMATE IT I'M NOT CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO SEE THIS I WOULD BE JUST AS HAPPY TO HAVE A NOVEL OR COMIC TELL THE STORY I DO SECOND WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID IN THIS THREAD ABOUT ORIGINAL CHARACTERS PERHAPS A FILM ABOUT THE REMNANTS OF THE EMPIRE FORMING INTO THE FIRST ORDER
A BOBA FETT MOVIE POST A NEW HOPE BUT PRE RETURN OF THE JEDI

ANGO FETT MOVIE THAT COULD FOCUS ON HIS WHOLE LIFE FROM CONCORD DAWN TO EPISODE II

MOVIE WHENEVER
IS REALLY THE ONLY ONE THAT I WANT I WOULDN'T MIND A KOROR SERIES I THINK A COUNT DOOK MOVIE MIGHT BE INTERESTING WE'VE SEEN THE STUDENT BETRAY THE MASTER SO IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO SEE IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND CULMINATING WITH DOOK COMING TO THE DARKSIDE AND TRYING TO CONVINCE TO JOIN HIM WHICH LEADS TO A ONE ON ONE CONFRONTATION IN THE FINAL ACT
WE SEE A LOT OF AND BOBA AND SIMOUS PLAGUES AND COUNT DOOK ONES ON HERE BUT ONE I HAVE EVER SEEN AND THINK WOULD GO WELL IS A ANGO FETT ANTHOLOGY MOVIE
MAX REBO AND SY NOODLES
OF COURSE
YODA
I'D RATHER HAVE A ANGO FETT BACKSTORY THAN A BOBA FETT ONE CONSIDERING CLONE WARS ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF INSIGHT ON BOBA
NONE NEW CHARACTERS NEW STORIES NEW ERAS ETC


MAYBE THOUGH BUT NOT FOR A WHILE
WEDGE ORIGIN STORY STARRING EWAN MACGREGOR
LANDO
THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN AND EVEN IF IT DID ALL THE PREQUEL HATERS WILL SHIT ALL OVER THE CGI THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE USED BUT I'D LOVE TO SEE A YODA STAND ALONE FRANK OZ IS STILL AROUND AND SEEING YODA AT HIS PRIME AND GETTING TO SEE THE OLD REPUBLIC LIVE ACTION WOULD BE ABOUT AS GAME CHANGING FOR THE SAGA AS THE PREQUEL WERE IN SHOWING US LIVE ACTION PRE EMPIRE
BOBA FETT
PALATINE
RIP OP
JEDI WAS UGGHHH WTF
HOW EXACTLY DID EPISODES AND GET THE SAME RATING AS EPISODE 2

ALSO REVENGE OF THE SITH WAS PRETTY GREAT IT'S MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE STAR WARS MOVIE SO FAR
I DISAGREE
JARJAR AND EWOS ARE THE TWO THINGS I STRUGGLE TO FORGIVE LUCAS FOR
BUT EWOS ASIDE THE STAGING OF JEDI I THINK PAID OFF IF ONLY BECAUSE OF THE FINAL CONFRONTATION BETWEEN LUKE AND HIS FATHER I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE LITTLE TEDDY BEARS PUT SOME PEOPLE OFF THEIR LIGHT SABERS THO

IMHO SITH AND EMPIRE WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST TECHNICALLY BRILLIANT EPS
THEY WERE ALSO THE DARKEST

HAVING SAID THAT I THINK FORCE AWAKENS WAS ALSO BRILLIANTLY DONE
I KNOW IT HAS ITS DETRACTORS AND YES SOME ELEMENTS WERE REHASHED BUT IT NEEDED THE BIG CINEMATIC PAY OFFICIAL

BUT THE NEW CHARACTERS AND STORYLINE WERE WELL EXECUTED AND SOME OF THE SCENES ARE BREATHTAKING BOTH CINEMATICALLY AND THEMATICALLY


SO REVENGE OF THE SITH IS THE BEST AND ATTACK OF THE CLONES IS ON PAR WITH A NEW HOPE AND EMPIRE STRIKES BACK KING
FAIR ENOUGH EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT TASTES WHEN IT COMES TO THE MOVIES PERSONALLY I RANK THEM 2 FROM FAVORITE TO LEAST
DELETED
THERE ARE ONLY TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT I CAN'T ABIDE

PEOPLE WHO ARE DISMISSIVE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS

AND PEOPLE WHO THINK THE STAR WARS PREQUEL ARE GOOD
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DIGITALLY ANYWHERE IT'S ALL OVER STAR RIGHT NOW THOUGH
IF YOU'RE IN THE USA I THINK IT'S STILL ON REBOX
ISN'T IT ON NETFLIX IF YOU HAVE NETFLIX OF COURSE
SHE SO PURTY
LOVE IT I WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING OVER THE HUMAN FIGURE A BIT BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT TO MOST ARTISTS INCLUDING MYSELF JUST CAUSE PROPORTIONS ARE AFFING HARD KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK THOUGH
THAT DUDE LOOKS BAKED AS FUCK I LOVE IT
GREAT PICTURE I LIKE THE LOOK IN HIS EYES SOMETHING VERY ABOUT IT LIKE HE'S TIRED BUT STILL DETERMINED I LOVE THAT YOU GOT THE BODY SHAPE UNDER THE ROBE IT'S SO EASY TO ACCIDENTALLY END UP WITH A FORMLESS BLOB BUT YOU SHAPED HIM VERY WELL HIS HANDS ARE A LITTLE AWKWARDLY PLACED BUT HANDS ARE RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT TO GET RIGHT AND REQUIRE SO MUCH PRACTICE WOULD ALSO LOVE TO SEE SOME COLOR IN IT KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
LOOKS GOOD THE PROPORTION ON HIS LEFT ARM IS A LITTLE OFF THOUGH
THANKS FOR THE CRITIQUE GUYS I NOTICED THE PROPORTION ESPECIALLY ON THE LEFT ARM IS KINDA IFFY HOPEFULLY IN FUTURE DRAWINGS I CAN GET BETTER AT IT BUT ANYWAY THANKS FOR POINTING OUT THE FLAWS HELPS ME NOTICE THINGS I WOULDN'T REALLY TAKE INTO MIND
TRY TO CONTRAST THE SHADOWS A BIT MORE WHEN YOU SHADE LIKE YOU DID HERE SOMETIMES IT MAKES THE PICTURE AND BORING REALLY GOOD JOB THOUGH HOPE TO SEE MORE FROM YOU IN THE FUTURE
YOU GOT VERY GOOD TEXTURE ON HIS HAIR AND BEARD KEEP DRAWING
I'M HOPING FOR AT LEAST A CAMEO MAYBE TOWARDS THE END WHEN THE REBELS SEND THE DEATH STAR PLANS TRANSMISSION TO PRINCESS SHIP
I MEAN THERE'S NO MANDATE THAT AND HAVE TO BE IN EVERY MOVIE IF THEY ARE IN IT I ONLY REALLY WANT A SHORT CAMEO RIGHT AT THE END OF THE FILM IF THERE IS MUCH MORE THAN THAT IT MIGHT SEEM FORCED IF THEY MAKE IT NATURAL THEN IT SHOULD BE OK
I'M NOT SURE IF THIS MAKES SENSE BUT KNOWING THERE WILL NOT BE A TITLE CRAWL MAKES ME OK WITH NOT BEING AROUND
IF HE'S IN IT SECONDS OR LESS
HE AND THREEPING ARE PROBABLY IN FOR A FEW SECONDS
ONLY AT THE ENDING I HOPE BOTH DROIDS ARE WITH LEIA DURING THIS TIME WE'LL LIKELY SEE THEM IN THE LAST SHOT OF THE MOVIE AS THE TACTIVE IV RECEIVES THE PLANS HOPEFULLY WITH THE FINAL SECONDS OF THE FILM BEING THE STAR DESTROYER AVENGER CLOSING IN ON THEM
I'M GUESSING ZERO
PROBABLY AT THE END
LUCAS OKEY WALT YOU CAN HAVE MY FRANCHISE AS LONG AS ARTOU IS IN EVERY NEW MOVIE FAIL ONCE AND THE RIGHTS REVERTS BACK TO ME
DOES THE BLIND GUY HAVE A GUN HETP
YES PLEASE WHY'S THE CURRENT HEADER IMAGE GOT US STUCK ON ENDOR ANYWAYS IT'S ROGUE ONE SEASON LET'S GET IN THE SPIRIT

WHY DOES IT SAY

NOW THAT IS SO BADASS IT SHOULD BE THE BANNER AT LEAST UNTIL THE NEW YEAR
YES PLEASE
ORIGINALLY VIA DISNEY RUSSIA
WOW THEY'RE ALL RUNNING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE HAPPENING ALL AROUND THEM
POSE REMINDS ME OF THIS

NICE I BET YOU HAD A BLAST
BACK HETP NOZZLE HETP SCOPE HETP
NOT IN CANON BUT THE LEGENDS STORY CAN BE FOUND HERE

THE TL R IS THAT LANDO WAS CAUGHT BY SURPRISE WHILE UNLOADING CARGO ON TANNA WITH A BUNCH OF PIRATES RAIDING A NUMBER OF OTHER SHIPS IN THE PLANET'S ORBIT LANDO OBSERVED HOW THEY WENT ABOUT THEIR RAIDS AND THEN DECIDED HE KNEW HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM HE TOOK HIS CARGO OF CONNER NETS A TYPE OF WEAPON THAT SHIPS THEY COLLIDE WITH THEN SHOT THE NETS WHEN THE PIRATES FLEW NEARBY AND THE NETS THEN A NUMBER OF PIRATE SHIPS BEFORE THE PIRATES COULD CLEAR THE NETS LANDO USED HIS SHIP TRACTOR BEAM TO REDIRECT PIECES OF ICE FROM A NEARBY MOON AT THEIR SHIPS HIS SUCCESS LED THE TANNA DEFENSE FORCE TO LAUNCH AND JOIN THE BATTLE WHICH LANDO ASSUMED COMMAND OF DEFEATING THE PIRATES AND CRIPPLING THEIR SHIPS IMPERIAL FORCES ARRIVED A FEW DAYS LATER TO ARREST THE PIRATES
IN NEITHER CANON OR LEGENDS IT WASN'T ACTUALLY LANDO IT WAS EITHER TAG OR BANKS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH
I LIKE TO THINK THAT MANEUVER AT THE BATTLE OF TACANA WASN'T SO MUCH A BATTLE AS IT WAS ONE OF OTHER CONQUESTS

SOMETHING THAT'S A LEGENDARY TALE AMONGST THE UNDERGROUND BUT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT BACK TO THE UPPER ECHELONS OF THE REBELLION
I GO TO OU THIS PLACE AND THIS BEER ROCK
HECK YEAH JACKIE O'S USED TO GO THERE ALL THE TIME WHEN I WENT TO OHIO UNIVERSITY THEIR RAZZ WHEAT IS PRETTY DAMN GOOD
THAT'S SO AWESOME
LAWSUIT INCOMING
SOURCE AND WHAT DOES THE JAPANESE MEAN
HE LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE JUST TOLD HIM THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS SILICON HEAVEN
WHICH MALL I LIVE IN MONTREAL
MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROIDS COUSIN
WHY IS HE SO SAD

THE REAL QUESTION IS WHERE DOES THIS THING END UP AFTER THE MOVIE IS IN THEATERS LIKE CAN YOU BUY IT OR DOES THE MALL GET IT
I HAVE A FEELING THAT K2 IS GOING TO BE A FAN FAVORITE
DON'T LOOK AT HIS RIGHT HAND OR YOU'LL GET PUNCHED ON YOUR SHOULDER
HE LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE TOOK HIS BROOM AWAY
HE LOOKS DANGEROUS LIKE A KID MADE IT
I THINK MY FAVORITE PART IS THAT HE'S SO MUCH TALLER THAN THE BACKDROP
VERY SAME REPLICA BACKDROP WAS AT VANCOUVER FAN EXPO
LOOKS LOVELY WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR NEXT ROAD TRIP TO MONTREAL DECEMBER CAN'T WAIT
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IN ACTION ONCE ROGUE ONE COMES OUT
MAN THIS WOULD BE SO TEMPTING TO TAKE YEA GUYS THIS ONE NEEDS MAINTENANCE I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WHY WOULD THE DEATH STAR NOT BE AT FULL POWER

WHY DOES LARKIN JUST FIRE FOR THE HELL OF IT THEN

IT SHOULD HAVE BLOWN UP BAVIN AND LEIA ALONG WITH IT IN THE BOOK OTHER THAN THAT I DO THINK IT'S A PRETTY COOL STORY
WATCH THIS BE A SHOT NOT EVEN IN THE FINAL CUT OF THE FILM
I THINK IT'D BE COOL IF IT WERE SIMPLY A HOODED VADER
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS SCENE BUGS THE ABSOLUTE CRAP OUT OF ME THERE ARE SO MANY POSSIBILITIES

IS IT DEFINITELY A ACTA TANK OR POSSIBLY SOME GYBER CRYSTAL POWER CORE
ARE THE ROYAL GUARDS EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE EMPEROR OR COULD THEY BE AROUND SOMEONE ELSE A VULNERABLE VADER TOO
IAN MCDIARMID SAYS HE'S NOT IN THE FILM WHAT IF HE'S LYING TO NOT SPOIL THE REVEAL
CLOAKED FIGURE KNEELING
EMPEROR DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HIS SHAPE AND WHY WOULD HE KNEEL
KRENNIC SEEMS TO ALWAYS WEAR WHITE EVEN BACK IN CATALYST BUT IT'S POSSIBLE HE HAS A DIFFERENT CLOAK HERE
VADER NOT HIS SUIT COULD BE IN A CLOAK BUT I'M NOT SURE THEY'D CHANGE UP HIS OUTFIT COULD BE ABOUT TO TAKE A DIP IN A ACTA TANK
GALEN ERGO COULD SEE HIM KNEELING CONFRONT OF HIS CAPTORS OR POSSIBLY HAVING AN OH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE MOMENT
I HAVE A FEELING THIS SCENE WON'T BE IN THE FINAL FILM
IT'S OBVIOUSLY CORDON
IF WE FIND OUT
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF THIS WAS CUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT
MY GUESS JUST KRENNIC IN A CLOAK REPORTING TO PALATINE
GALEN EYERS
DARTH JAR JAR
WHO'S THAT POKEMON
I JUST REALLY WANT IT TO BE PALPS
BIGGEST MYSTERY YET
SAYS IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DEATH STAR PLANS AND THAT'S NOT AN ACTA TANK
THE EMPEROR'S HAND MARA JADE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE
THRAWN

S

I CAN DREAM
MAYBE IT'S JUST ANAKIN ENTERING A ACTA TANK TO CONTINUE HIS HEALING FROM THAT BATTLE ON MUSTAFAR
ORIGINS
IT MIGHT NOT BE ANYONE IT COULD BE A POWER GENERATOR OR GYBER CRYSTAL STORAGE
IT COULD BE THE EMPEROR BONDING THE CRYSTALS DON'T CRYSTALS HAVE TO BE BONDED IN NEW CANON MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO INCREASE THE POWER OUTPUT OR STABILIZE THEM OR WHATEVER TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS MENTIONED IN CATALYST AND WHAT WERE SEEING HERE IS SIMPLY ONE OF THE MANY CRYSTALS USED THAT NEEDS TO BE BONDED OR SOMETHING I DUNNO THIS SHOT STILL HAS ME SCRATCHING MY HEAD
ITS KRENNIC AND VADER WILL WALK UP TO HIM
ARE THEY KNEELING OR IS IT THE ANGLE AND THEIR POSTURE THE EMPEROR'S ROYAL GUARDS ARE PRESENT SO IT HAS TO BE THE EMPEROR RIGHT WE HAVE ONLY SEEN THEM WITH HIM ADAMIK BUT HE COULD ORDER THEM TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTED I GUESS ALSO I CAN'T SEE ANYBODY IN THE TANK SO IT COULD BE THE EMPEROR APPROACHING AN EMPTY TANK
VADER GETTING OUT OF THE SHOWER ABOUT TO CHILL IN A ACTA TANK
I'M THINKING IT'S LYRA EYERS AS KRENICKS LEVERAGE OVER GALEN
IT'S VADER THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT TO REVEAL HIM BACK THEN
MY BET IS EITHER ON AN INQUISITOR OR GALEN

EDIT THOUGH IT'D BE WEIRD FOR AN ENGINEER TO BE WEARING A CLOAK LIKE THAT
ITS ACTUALLY PRETTY ANNOYING HOW THE GUY ISN'T CENTERED WHEN LOOKING AT THE TANK
MARA JADE OR EZRA BRIDGER
EVERYONE ALREADY KNOWS THAT IS SNOKE
IT'S THE EMPEROR IT HAS TO BE THE EMPEROR THE ROYAL GUARDS ARE A DEAD GIVEAWAY THEY DON'T JUST POST THOSE GUYS UP WHEREVER THAT COUPLED WITH THE HOODED FIGURE LOOKING JUST LIKE THE EMPEROR MAKES FOR A PRETTY GLARING 2 2 EQUATION

THAT SAID I FULLY EXPECT THIS MOVIE TO LET ME DOWN AND MAKE IT SOMEONE ELSE
WILD MASS GUESSING EZRA BRIDGER PREPARING TO FIGHT VADER TO BUY THE ROGUE ONE TEAM TIME HE LOSES AND IS HORRIFICALLY SCARRED ONLY HIS LINK TO THE DARK SIDE KEEPS HIM ALIVE AS HE RETREATS INTO SHADOW

OR KANAN FOR THE SAME REASON PREPARING TO GET CUT DOWN BY VADER AND SET EZRA UP FOR A LATER DARK SIDE FALL

EDIT DOWNVOTED TO HECK FOR SOMETHING I FLAGGED AS A WILD GUESS REDDIN IS A WEIRD PLACE SOMETIMES
YOU CAN CROP IT
WORDS CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I DESPERATELY NEED ONE
DANG IT I HAVE NO ALAMO DRAFTHOUSE NEAR ME
I ENJOYED THE NEW DRAFTHOUSE IN BROOKLYN BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT BEING A GREAT ENVIRONMENT TO SEE THE NEW STAR WARS MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH SERVERS CRAWLING ABOUT TAKING ORDERS AND GETTING REFILLS
IF I WAS A JEDI I'M PRETTY SURE I'D SPEND OF MY TIME PRACTISING WITH A LIGHTSABER
I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE A TON OF GREAT DUELISTS HONESTLY I AGREE THAT COUNT DOOK HINDU YODA AND AIN DIALLING WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE TOP OF THEIR TIME PERIOD BUT HOW DO WE KNOW HOW GOOD THEY ARE COMPARED TO PAST JEDI AND SITH

WELL LET'S LOOK AT OLD REPUBLIC TIMES BACK THEN WHEN THEIR ARE S OF THOUSANDS OF JEDI AND SITH BOTH FORCE USERS WOULD HAVE LIGHTSABER DUEL WEEKLY SO THE PRACTICE COMBINED WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE OF FIGHTING ALL THE TIME MADE THEM GREAT WARRIORS AND DUELISTS

NOW BY THE CLONE WARS JEDI DON'T GET REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE DUELING THAT MUCH THE FEW JEDI WHO ACTUALLY FIGHT A DARK SIDER ARE SO LOW BECAUSE OF PEOPLE ONLY FIGHTING DOOK IS A FEW PEOPLE AND THEN THE OCCASIONAL DARK JEDI THEY PRACTICE A LOT SURE BUT WHAT GOOD DOES THAT DO IF YOU NEVER REALLY FIGHT IN A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION SO THAT IS WHY EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE GREAT DUELISTS OF THE CLONE WARS ERA THEY ARE MUCH WEAKER THAN THE OLD REPUBLIC DUELISTS THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS WHO I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE ON THE LEVEL OF THE OLD REPUBLIC DUELISTS WOULD BE MACE HINDU BECAUSE OF HIS USE OF VAAPAD GAVE HIM SUCH AN ADVANTAGE OVER DARK SIDERS COUNT DOOK MATCHES UP WITH THE OLD REPUBLIC DUELISTS BECAUSE HE IS A MASTER OF FORM 2 WHICH IS LITERALLY DESIGNED FOR LIGHTSABER DUELING HE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST EVER THEN YODA IS ON PAR WITH THE OLD REPUBLIC DUELISTS BECAUSE OF HIS UNIQUE STYLE WHILE HE USES AARU HIS VARIATION IS EXTREMELY HAD TO DEFEND AGAINST SINCE THERE HAS ONLY BEEN LIKE OR JEDI OF HIS SPECIES EVER SO NO ONE REALLY KNOWS HOW TO COUNTER HIM THAT WELL

SO OVERALL THE TOP DUELISTS OF HE CLONE WARS ARE GREAT BUT JUST FOR THEIR TIME PERIOD THE OLD REPUBLIC DUELISTS ARE GREAT AND BETTER BECAUSE OF THE CONSTANT LIFE OR DEATH SITUATIONS THEY ARE PUT HIM WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO PRACTICE MORE

BLDR THE JEDI OF THE CLONE WARS ERA DON'T DUEL AS MUCH AS THE JEDI OF THE OLD REPUBLIC SO THE JEDI OF THE CLONE WARS AS GREAT FOR THEIR TIME PERIOD BUT THE JEDI OF THE OLD REPUBLIC WERE MUCH BETTER
IT'S A HUGE PART OF JEDI TRAINING IN ONE OF THE NEW COMICS WE SEE THAT DUELING HOLOGRAMS ARE COMMON EVEN YOUNGLINGS REGULARLY SPAR WITH PRACTICE LIGHTSABERS THAT DON'T CAUSE INJURY
MPH THERE WERE TEN THOUSAND JEDI NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION TO HAVE SOME VERY TALENTED OR DEVOTED LEARNERS
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY WILL GO ON SALE
GETTING A BIT ANNOYED WITH THIS TICKET WAITING GAME THEY'RE PLAYING NOT COOL DISNEY
TICKETS ARE GOING TO OPEN ON SUNDAYNIGHT MONDAY MORNING AM MULTIPLE NEWS SITES HAVE CONFIRMED IT
I JUST HOPE THERE EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE IS WORTH THE WAIT
IF IT HELPS ANY THREE OF THE MANAGERS AT MY THEATER TOLD ME THAT THEY'RE RELEASING TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT
THE APP I USE ALREADY HAS PLACEHOLDER FOR CHOWTIMES NOT UNLICKABLE YET THOUGH
GUYS THEY'RE GOING ON SALE AT A MASCULINE SUNDAY NIGHT CONFIRMED BY THE ALAMO DRAFTHOUSE AND OTHER THEATER CHAINS THAT HAVE SENT EMAILS FOR THIS
OH LOOK IT'S EVEN IN 3D

FANTASTIC WHICH ONE
WHEN YOU'RE NOT A HUGE STAR WARS FAN BUT SAW THE FORCE AWAKENS AND ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE REY FITS INTO THE STORY
IT'S A BIT SAD THAT APPARENTLY SAW GERAERA DOESN'T PLAY A BIGGER ROLE
WHEN ARE TICKETS GOING ON SALE IN THE US
IT LIGHTS UP BUT AT MY THEATER ONE OF THE PANELS WASNT WORKING
ITS EVEN COOLER WHEN ITS PLUGGED IN LOL THE BLUEPRINTS REALLY STICK OUT WHEN ITS LIT UP
ANY NEWS ON TICKET
THE HYPE IS SWELLING IN YOU NOW
I LOVE HOW THE GUY ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT WAS IN A FILM CALLED FOUR LOINS WHERE HE PLAYS A WANT TO BE TERRORIST AND IN THIS HE'S BEING A FREEDOM FIGHTER
TICKETS ARE IN MY WALLET ALREADY CAME ON SALE THIS WEEK IN THE UK
IT CAN ENTER HYPERSPACE JUST LIKE THE DEATH STAR
GOOD NEWS THE CHARACTER IS ALSO MEANT TO BE YEARS OLDER SO HIS VOICE IS TOTALLY ALLOWED TO SOUND DIFFERENT
PEOPLE AGE

NOT A HELL OF A LOT YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT
I THINK IT WOULD BE WEIRD IF HE SOUNDED EXACTLY THE SAME AS LUKE FROM ROTC
NOT ONLY SHOULD HE SOUND OLDER HE'S BEEN A VOICE ACTOR FOR A LONG TIME SO NO NOT WORRIED AT ALL
CHARACTER IS OLDER AND PRESUMABLY BATTLE WORN OR DEALING WITH SOME HEAVY SHIT I DON'T THINK IT'S AN ISSUE
HE'S NOT GOING TO SOUND LIKE A SMOKER IF YOU'VE HEARD MARK HAMILL SPEAK IN HIS REGULAR VOICE HE SIMPLY SOUNDS LIKE AN OLDER VERSION OF HIMSELF A LITTLE LESS NASALLY A LITTLE MORE GRAVELLY BUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY TELL IT'S HIM
SPOILER LUKE TURNED TO THE DARK SIDE AFTER ALL TALKS LIKE THE JOKER NOW
ANOTHER POINT IS THAT PHYSICALLY IF YOU LOOK YEARS AGO IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE HIM PLAYING AGAIN LUKE HOWEVER THOSE ACTORS ARE WELL COACHED AND YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF STUFF LIKE THIS
MARK STILL SOUNDS THE SAME TO ME CARRIE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT SOUNDED WEIRD TO ME TSH
I WANT TO HEAR LUKE LAUGH LIKE THE JOKER
EDIT I JUST DON'T WANT HIM TO SOUND LIKE A SMOKER IS ALL

HE DOESN'T HAVE YOU EVEN HEARD MARK HAMILL RECENTLY

WATCH V
ARE YOU NOT EXCITED FOR JOKER LUKE
BUT FOR SERIOUS THOUGH PEOPLE'S VOICES CHANGE WHEN THEY GET OLDER LUKE IS LIKE YEARS OLDER SINCE THE LAST TIME WE SAW HIM SO IT'S REALLY NOT THAT WEIRD
I'M MORE INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHY HE GOT RID OF HIS MORE REALISTIC PROSTHETIC HAND
A YOU WANT THE PERSON TO JUST NOT SOUND LIKE THE WAY THEY CURRENTLY SOUND
B WHAT IS YOUR OBSESSION WITH THIS SMOKER VOICE NOT EVERYONE WHO SMOKES CIGARETTES ENDS UP SOUNDING LIKE THEY'VE CHEWED GRAVEL
C YOU'RE AN IDIOT THAT'S JUST A CONCLUSION FROM A AND B
I THINK THEY ALL DIE OR ANYWAY KINDA LIKE SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR THEORY IS THAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE THEY JUST PUT HER ON ALDERMAN TO DIE IF SHE DIES SHE SHOULD DIE ON THE MISSION AND NOT AFTER THE JOB IS DONE AS A CASUALTY
NOT UNTIL OUR REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE TO PUSH OUT THE TERRORISTS ONCE AND FOR ALL THE REBEL PROPAGANDA MACHINE CALLED LUCASFILM IN THIS REBEL DOMINATED SECTOR OF SPACE HAS BEEN CHURNING OUT THESE FAKE DOCUMENTARIES FOR AGES NOW AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE STOPPING ANYTIME SOON

JUST IN DAYS ANOTHER PROPAGANDA FEATURE FILM LENGTH DOCUMENTARY WILL BE RELEASED SHOWING US IMPERIALS IN BAD LIGHT IN MANY COMPLETELY FICTIONAL SITUATIONS NO LESS STRAIGHT OUT LIES OF COURSE IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT PEOPLE REALLY THINK THE ELITE TROOPERS CAN'T EVEN AIM LET ALONE THINKING LITTLE STUPID BEARS CAN DEFEAT US WITH ROCKS AND STICKS IT'S RIDICULOUS HOW GULLIBLE THESE HUMANS ARE HERE

THE DOCUMENTARIES ARE ALL TWISTED AND INTENDED TO MAKE THE EMPIRE LOOK LIKE SOMETHING EVIL WHEN IN FACT THE JEDI AND TERRORIST REBELS ARE THE EVIL ONES TRYING TO STOP THE EMPIRE FROM CREATING A SAFE AND SECURE SOCIETY ONCE WE SECURE THIS EARTH AND THE NEIGHBOURING SYSTEMS THEN WE WILL ALSO CORRECT THE DEPICTION OF HISTORY TO BE TRUTHFUL AGAIN

I DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING DISNEY SEEMS TO BE PRETTY CONTENT STICKING WITH THE FAIRLY BLACK AND WHITE GOOD BAD NARRATIVE INSTEAD OF GOING INTO SHADES OF GRAY

HONESTLY THOUGH I'D GIVE MY LEFT NUT FOR A PROPER NETFLIX SERIES OR SOMETHING THAT WAS ALL ABOUT THE GOOD SIDE OF THE EMPIRE AND THE STORM-TROOPER CORPS SPECIFICALLY SHOWING THEM AS THE DIE-HARD ELITE SHOCK TROOPS OF A POPULAR MOFF TRYING TO MAKE HIS SECTOR A BETTER PLACE FOR EVERYONE AS MUCH AS I LOVE STAR WARS THE BLACK AND WHITE IS REALLY TIRESOME
I THINK IT'D BE INTERESTING TO SHOW A PROTAGONIST WHO'S ON A NEUTRAL SIDE OF THINGS
R EMPIREDIDNOTHINGWRONG IS LEAKING
YOU MEAN LIKE ERADICATING THE JEDI
I'D BE FOR THAT SCAR SQUAD IN THE COMICS HAS BEEN COOL TO READ AND SO WAS INSPECTOR THANOTH
WE NEED TO HAVE THE EMPIRE SHOWN IN A GOOD LIGHT AND THE REBELS JEDI AS EVIL CERTAINLY

I NEVER THOUGHT THOSE TERRORIST REBEL SCUM WERE ANYTHING BUT VILLAINOUS LAWBREAKERS
YOU MEAN THE CLONES OF THE CLONE WARS

UNTIL THE ORDER MADE THEM TURN ON THE JEDI THEY WERE GREAT
I WANT A MOVIE ABOUT DOCTOR APHRA
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT CLONE WARS IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY MANY EPISODES ARE COMPLETELY FOCUSED ON THE CLONES

I COULD IMAGINE A MOVIE THOUGH WHERE THEY SHOW RECRUITS BECOMING INVOLVED IN THE EMPIRE'S WAR MACHINE SIMILAR TO THE OLD TIE FIGHTER GAMES WHERE YOU COULD BECOME THE EMPEROR'S TOP PILOT
SO YOU THINK THE PEOPLE WHO

COMMITTED GENOCIDE AGAINST THE GEONOSIANS

COMMITTED GENOCIDE AGAINST THE NIGHT SISTERS

WIPED OUT MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION OF A WORLD INHABITED BY THE ASAT

KILLED HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS SIMPLY TO WIPE OUT A SMALL GROUP OF REBELS

COMMITTED GENOCIDE AGAINST THE JEDI ORDER

DESTROYED THE INHABITED PLANET OF ALDERMAN

AND USES THE AS A SLAVE RACE SHOULD HAVE A MOVIE WHERE THEY'RE THE GOOD GUYS IS THIS ONE OF THOSE EMPIRE DID NOTHING WRONG JOKES
WIFE TAUNTAUN SPACE KANGAROO CAMPA SNOW YETI NOT EVEN ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN
FUN TIMES
NO AMOUNT OF ADVERTISING CAN FIX THIS NOT EVERYONE HAS THE TIME OR INTEREST TO PAY ATTENTION AS LONG AS THEY PAY FOR THE TICKETS AND GET INTO THE THEATRES TO SEE IT DISNEY WILL BE HAPPY ENOUGH

THE BEST SOLUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ADD A CRAWL AT THE BEGINNING TO EXPLAIN WHERE IT FITS ON THE TIMELINE IMO BUT SINCE THEY'VE FORGONE THAT FOR STYLISTIC EFFECT I'LL RESPECT THAT DECISION IT'S TOO BAD THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO BE CONFUSED WE'LL HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO THEM
I DONT TALK STAR WARS TO NON FANS SO I DONT RUN INTO THIS PROBLEM I DONT HAVE TIME TO EXPLAIN TO ANYONE WHO CANT PAY ATTENTION THEMSELVES
I HAVE A ONE LINE EXPLANATION ROUGE ONE IS EPISODE NOT EPISODE

THAT SUFFICES WITHOUT WANTING TO TEAR YOUR HAIR OUT
I WORK AT THE LEGO STORE AND I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS ALL THE TIME LOL
I JUST HOPE THAT THE ALLIANCE CAN TAKE OUT THE EMPIRE'S SUPER WEAPON BEFORE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS
I WOULD ARGUE DISNEY HASN'T DONE THE BEST JOB EXPLAINING THIS TO THE CASUAL AUDIENCE HARDCORE FANS UNDERSTAND BUT YOUR MORE CASUAL VIEWER NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED MORE EXPLICITLY NOT FROM FOOTAGE BITS AND CHARACTER DIALOG IN TV ADS

MY BROTHER AND I HAVE UNDERSTOOD FROM DAY ONE BECAUSE WE ARE HUGE FANS MY MOTHER WHO HAS WATCHED EVERY MOVIE CASUALLY NEEDED A MORE EXPLANATION FROM US

JUST MY TAKE I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT AN EXPERT IN MARKET RESEARCH
LOOK I'M HERE FROM R ALL TOP HOUR I GREW UP NOT SEEING STAR WARS AND DON'T CARE FOR THEM ALL THAT MUCH BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT SOUNDS LIKE IT COMES SOMEWHERE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SERIES AND WON'T HAVE THE MAIN CEDIS IN IT

AM I RIGHT
I THINK IT'S ALL DOWN TO BASIC PATTERN RECOGNITION STAR WARS HAS NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN FIRST SECOND THIRD A TRILOGY AT A TIME NOW IT'S FIRST STANDALONE SECOND STANDALONE THIRD NO ONE KNOWS THIS BUT FANS IT'S A DEEP CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE THAT STAR WARS EXISTS IN TRILOGIES IT'S A HARD THING TO BREAK
I JUST TELL THEM IT'S A PREQUEL TO THE FIRST ONE THEY CAN FIGURE IT OUT FROM THERE
SOME PEOPLE NOT ONLY DON'T PICK UP ON THHHGD BUT THEY DON'T CARE ENOUGH TO TRY TO PICK UP ON THINGS THEY'RE CURIOUS ENOUGH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT BEING CONFUSED BUT NOT CURIOUS ENOUGH TO PAY ATTENTION AND HAVE THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED IT'S A FRUSTRATING MIDDLE GROUND IT'S WHY I CAN'T WATCH MOVIES WITH MY GRANDMA
I JUST LITERALLY FIVE MINUTES AGO HAD THIS CONVERSION WITH MY BROTHER IN LAW HE THOUGHT IT WAS EP VIII HE'S NO DUMMY SO A QUICK EXPLANATION SUFFICED BUT I CAN SEE HOW OTHERS WOULD BE VERY CONFUSED


AT THIS POINT IF YOU ARE A CASUAL AND THINK IS EPISODE THEN IT'S THEIR FAULT NOT LUCASFILM
I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE CASUAL FANS SO OFTEN YOU HAVE MY CONDOLENCES
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO SAY IT'S A PREQUEL THAT SHOWS HOW THE REBELS GOT THE PLANS TO THE DEATH STAR AND LEAVE IT AT THAT THE WAY I SEE SOME PEOPLE TREAT CASUALS IRRITATES ME BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN NEW TO SOME FANDOM AT SOME POINT
I THINK AFTER RELEASING THIS AND THE HAN SOLO ONE THAT PEOPLE WILL CATCH ON I ACTUALLY THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE ANTHOLOGY NAME FOR THE FILMS THOUGH
IT'S NOT POOR MARKETING I THINK IT'S JUST THE BANDWAGON FANS THAT ARE HAVING ISSUES IN MY OPINION WE'VE GOTTEN TRAILERS THAT HAVE SHOWN IMPERIAL STORM-TROOPER OT REBELS IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYERS DARTH VADER MON MOTHMA AND THE DEATH STAR HECK WE'VE EVEN SEEN AN A VEHICLE THAT HASN'T BEEN IN A STAR WARS FILM SINCE THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY IN ONE OF THE TRAILERS IF PEOPLE CANNOT FIGURE OUT THAT THIS MOVIE TAKE PLACE BEFORE EPISODE IV WEEKS BEFORE THIS FILMS RELEASE THEN THAT'S ON THEM
KIND OF UNAVOIDABLE WHEN YOU MAKE A WHOLE MOVIE BASED ON A PARAGRAPH OF THE OPENING CRAWL FROM A NEW HOPE I WONDER HOW MUCH THE CASUAL FAN REALLY CARES ABOUT THIS STORY
ITS JUST PEOPLE NOT PAYING ATTENTION AT THIS POINT
MY AUNT ASKED ME LIKE FIFTEEN TIMES IF THAT WAS LITTLE LUKE IN THE PHANTOM MENACE
PEOPLE ARE DUMB CANT FIX STUPID
MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT CASUAL FANS UNDERSTAND IT THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY DISNEY DECIDED TO JUMP BACK IN TIME AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT EITHER

WHY DID THIS SPECIFIC STORY NEED TO BE TOLD DID ANYONE REALLY CARE HOW THE DEATH STAR PLANS WERE OBTAINED IT WAS PROBABLY THE LEAST INSPIRING SPINOFF IDEA AVAILABLE TO THEM ESPECIALLY AFTER STARKVILLE LITERALLY MADE THE DEATH STAR LOOK TINY THEY ACTUALLY SHOWED US A VISUAL COMPARISON FOR GOODNESS SAKE

THIS IS WHY I SYMPATHISED WITH THE AYN MOM SPECULATION THAT WASN'T JUST IDIOT FANBOYS FEVERISHLY MAKING CONNECTIONS FOR NO REASON FINN CALRISSIAN ANYONE IT CAME OUT OF A DESIRE TO GIVE ROGUE ONE A LEGITIMATE REASON TO EXIST IT WOULD PROVIDE A STORYTELLING JUSTIFICATION FOR LEAPING BACK DECADES IN TIME THIS IS OUR NEW HEROINE OF MYSTERIOUS PARENTAGE AND NOW WE REVEAL HER MOTHER AND THEN IN EPISODE WE REVEAL LUKE TO BE HER FATHER HER PARENTS WERE THE TWO HEROES WHO DESTROYED THE DEATH STAR SO NEAT YOU COULD TIE A BOW AROUND IT

ANYWAY I'LL STILL BE FIRST IN LINE AND I HOPE IT'S BRILLIANT AND I HOPE THAT IT RACKS UP A HUGE TOTAL AT THE BOX OFFICE SO WE CAN GET MORE INTERESTING SPINOFFS IN FUTURE


DELETED
NOT YET BUT I WILL BE I WILL BE
I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHO YOU GUYS ARE TALKING TO WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS STUFF IT AIN'T HARD
YEAH I'VE ALSO DONE THIS QUITE A BIT WHEN I TOLD ONE OF MY BROTHERS THAT IT WAS SET BETWEEN AND HE WAS LIKE WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST MAKE THE MOVIES IN ORDER HE IS NOT A FAN OF THE CONCEPT OF PREQUEL IT SEEMS SINCE HE THOUGHT THE SAME THING ABOUT EP AND THE HOBBIT MOVIES AS WELL
THE TRAILERS EXPLAIN THAT THEY'RE STEALING PLANS TO THE DEATH STAR AND STARTING A REBELLION IF PEOPLE WANT TO IGNORE THAT AND PRETEND LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS MOVIE FITS IN THE TIMELINE THAT'S THEIR OWN FAULT YOU CAN'T A MARKETING CAMPAIGN

AND ANYWAY PEOPLE KNOW IT'S A STAR WARS MOVIE WORST CASE IS PEOPLE THINK IT'S EPISODE AND WATCH IT INSTEAD WILL THEY BE SO INSULTED THAT THEY BOYCOTT EPISODE WHEN IT ACTUALLY COMES OUT
I CAN SAY WITH HONESTY THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO EXACTLY ONE PERSON IN REAL LIFE ABOUT ROGUE ONE AND HE'S JUST AS MUCH OF A FAN AS I AM SO HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT ITS ABOUT
DELETED
DOES DISNEY PAY YOU FOR ALL THE PUBLICITY WORK YOU ARE DOING
THAT MEAT IS A BIT ON THE DARK SIDE ISN'T IT
DWARF VADER
BYE BYE HAND
IT WON'T HAPPEN DISNEY WON'T TAKE AWAY FROM ROGUE ONE'S MARKETING WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT EPISODE WILL DO MARKETING WAS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT WAS THE RETURN OF STAR WARS SO THEY COULD START TEASING IT A YEAR IN ADVANCE THEY CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE BECAUSE IT WILL NOW OVERLAY WITH WHATEVER THE CURRENT MOVIE OUT IN THEATERS IS THEY WILL START TEASING EPISODE ONCE ROGUE ONE IS OUT ON DVD JUST LIKE THE ROGUE ONE'S MARKETING STARTED A FEW DAYS AFTER FFA CAME OUT ON DVD THEY WILL MOST LIKELY SHOW THE FIRST TEASER OR AT LEAST TITLE DURING CELEBRATION IN
THE TEASER FOR ROGUE ONE WASN'T OUT WITH FORCE AWAKENS WHICH IS MORE USEFUL TO USE AS A MEASURE THAN THE FFA TEASER THAT WAS LIKE A TEASER FOR THE ENTIRE FRANCHISE IN A WAY
THE GENERAL CONSENSUS IS NO IT'LL COME OUT AT CELEBRATION I'M LEANING THAT WAY MYSELF BUT I THINK THERE IS A NOTICEABLE CHANCE FOR A TEASER LEADING INTO VIII IF THEY MAKE A SPECIAL ONE JUST FOR THAT THEY CAN DO IT SPECIFICALLY TO CLARIFY THAT NO THIS IS NOT VIII THIS IS SET LONG BEFORE IT

I'D SAY MAYBE A CHANCE BEFORE CHANCE OF CELEBRATION
I REALLY HOPE THIS IS MANMADE
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I CAN DOWNLOAD FROM PREMIUM BEATS
I'M CALLING BULLSHIT NOT EVEN REAL INSTRUMENTS
DARK DEEDS FROM THE OST
PFC UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS ON THE SUPER BATTLEDROID
WHEN I THINK OF UNIFORMS AND APPEARANCES MY FIRST THOUGHT ALMOST ALWAYS GOES TO THE MOVIE VERSIONS

ALL EXCEPT THE SUPER BATTLE DROID FOR THEM I SEE THE CLONE WARS VERSION FOR SOME REASON HECK I SAW THIS IMAGE AND THOUGHT OH YEAH THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IN THE MOVIES
FOR THE MOST PART I'M OK WITH THE STYLISTIC DIFFERENCES IN REBELS BUT I CANNOT STAND THE STORM-TROOPER OR THE STUBBY TIES
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO PREFERS THE FILM SUPER BATTLE DROIDS THAT MORE HOMINID SHAPE IS JUST MORE MENACING
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE DEFORMED STYLE OF REBELS THO I KNOW THEY WENT WITH THE OVERALL CARTOON STYLE BUT IT JUST LOOKS OFFICIAL THE TIES LOOK WEIRD AND THE BRIDGES ON TOP OF THE STAR DESTROYERS LOOK RIDICULOUS I ALSO PREFERRED TO SEE THE REAL DARTH VADER IN THAT SERIES INSTEAD OF THE ONE INSPIRED ON CONCEPT ARTICLE THE ANIMATED SERIES AREN'T VERY GOOD FOR CONTINUITIES SAKE
DOES ANYONE ELSE SEE GRUMPY CAT WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE ANIMATED STORM-TROOPER
CLONE WARS ART DIRECTION WAS STELLAR IN THESE EXAMPLES BOTH CLONES AND DROIDS ARE MORE DISTINCTIVE THAN THEIR MOVIE COUNTERPARTS

FOR SOME REASON I HATE THE REBELS STORM-TROOPER THE EXTRA LARGE CHIN AREA MAKES THEM LOOK AWKWARD AND COMICAL AND DEEMPHASIZES THE SKULL INFLUENCE OF THE HELMET DESIGN REDUCING THEIR VISUAL MENACE
HONESTLY I THINK THE CLONE TROOPER ARMOR WAS IMPROVED BY ACW BUT THE MOVIE VERSIONS FOR STORM-TROOPER AND SUPER BATTLE DROIDS ARE BETTER
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE STORM-TROOPER ON THE LEFT IS FROM RETURN OF THE JEDI THE STORM-TROOPER IN STAR WARS REBELS ARE BASED ON THE STUNT COSTUMES FROM A NEW HOPE HERE'S A CLOSE-UP
WHY DO THEY MAKE THEM PURPOSELY LOOK STUPID SPECIFICALLY THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM
THE STORM TROOPER LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE USED THE FROWN FILTER ON SNAPCHAT
I JUST REALIZED THE SUPER BATTLE DROIDS HAVE HEADS
JUST NOTICED MY TYPO DAMN IT ME
JUST TO SAY WHEN TALKING ABOUT STAR WARS REBELS IT'S APPARENTLY DESIGNED AFTER THE ORIGINAL IMAGES FOR THE STAR WARS MOVIES THE LIGHTSABERS ARE THINNER WITH A SHARPER TIP ALONG WITH THE BEAST ZEB BEING WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PORTRAYED FOR THE ANIMAL CHARACTER THAT BECAME CHEWBACCA ETC

STORY LIFE TV
IT LOOKS LIKE EACH TINY DETAIL FROM THE MOVIES IS EXAGGERATED IN THEN ANIMATED SHOWS LOOKS FINE TO ME EXCEPT FOR THE REBELS STORM TROOPER
REAL SUPER BATTLE DROIDS HAVE CURVES
AND IN EVERY CASE THE MOVIE VERSION IS BETTER
UGH I DESPISE THE ACW PHASE I HELMET JUST LOOKS SO DUMB AT LEAST REBELS GOT IT BETTER
IT'S ONLY TODAY THAT I REALISED SUPER BATTLE DROIDS HAVE HEADS I ALWAYS SAW THEIR HEAD AS JUST AN AESTHETIC BUMP I NEED TO REEVALUATE THINGS
I ACTUALLY PREFER ACW OF BOTH THE CLONE AND SBA
THE TROOPERS LOOK ESPECIALLY AWFUL
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE SHOWS ART STYLE
THE SW REBELS STORM-TROOPER LOOKS LIKE A STORM-TROOPER THAT WAS STUNG BY A BEE
ARTISTIC STYLE IS ONE THING BUT NO ONE HAS EYES ON THEIR FUCKING FOREHEAD SERIOUSLY WITH THIS
THAT STORM-TROOPER LOOKS LIKE HE'S MISSING THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
I'M KIND OF FRUSTRATED THEY'RE NOT ALMOST IDENTICAL
TV CLONE HELMET LOOKS LIKE A BUTT PLUG
I FOR ONE REALLY LIKE THE REBELS STORM-TROOPER DESIGN
WHAT IS UP WITH THE EYES ON THAT STORM TROOPER ON THE LEFT HIS EYES ARE ALL LOPSIDED
REBELS WENT FULL RETARD WITH THEIR STORM-TROOPER

I NEVER REALLY LIKED THE SUPER BATTLE DROID DESIGN FROM THE ANIMATED CLONE WARS THEY LOOK GOOFY TO ME
MOVIE LOOKS ALOT BETTER IN MY OPINION THE SHOWS LOOK LIKE A PROTOTYPE THAT WORKS BUT STILL NEEDS TO BE REFINED TO A FINAL PRODUCT
THE SUPER BATTLEDROIDS LOOK LIKE THE GUARDIAN BEINGS FROM THE FIFTH ELEMENT
I DON'T MIND THE STYLE DIFFERENCE ESPECIALLY IN ACW SERIES BECAUSE THE STORY WRITING IS BETTER
THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT ONLY ONE OF THESE IS ACTUALLY PRACTICAL
STORM-TROOPER CHIN IS HUGH MANGOES
MOVES
FUCKING REBELS STORM-TROOPER LOOKS LIKE A PUG SERIOUSLY WHAT'S UP WITH THAT GIGANTIC CHIN AND TINY FOREHEAD
THE CLONES AND TROOPERS LOOK LIKE THEY USED THE FROWNY SNAPCHAT FILTER
I GUESS SOMEONE HAS ALREADY SAID IT BUT THE STORM-TROOPER IN THE PICTURE IS FROM ROTC SO IT WOULD BE BETTER TO COMPARE A ANH ONE TO THE REBELS ONE
I'M ACTUALLY SHOCKED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE USING MINOR VARIATION IN ARMOR AS THIS IS WHY I HATE THE SHOWS LIKE WOW THAT'S A NEW LEVEL OF PETTY NOW IF YOU HATE THE ACTUAL HUMAN ALIEN MODELS THAT'S DIFFERENT OF COURSE BUT SERIOUSLY OH MY GOD THE CLONE HELMET FLARES OUT TOO MUCH EVERYTHING IS RUINED

ALSO THE ANIMATED SUPER BATTLE DROID LOOKS WAY BETTER WELL OKAY THE WAIST IS A BIT TOO CINCHED
YOU SHOULD OF DONE A COMPARISON OF ALL BATTLEDROIDS BETWEEN THE FILMS REBELS AND CLONE WARS
TO BE HONEST IN ANYTHING BUT THE ACTUAL MOVIES THE SUPER BATTLE DROIDS WERE HIGHLY OVER EXAGGERATED IMO

THEY ALWAYS LOOKED AND FELT LIKE BEHEMOTHS WHO WERE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO DESTROY YES THEY WERE SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER THAN THEIR REGULAR BATTLE DROID COUNTERPARTS BUT FOR GODS SAKE IT SHOULDN'T TAKE UP HALF YOUR AMMUNITION IN REPUBLIC COMMANDO JUST TO KILL ONE

I KNOW THEIR ARE EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS BATTLEFRONT II WHERE IT WAS AN ACTUAL PLAYABLE UNIT SO IT HAD TO BE BALANCED FOR ENJOYABILITY BUT THIS IS SOMETHING I NOTICED A LOT OF IN A LOT OF EU STUFF RELATING TO THE CLONE WARS ERA
NOT SURE WHAT THE POINT OF THIS IS THE STAR WARS ANIMATED SHOWS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY STYLIZED
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THE REASON I CAN'T WATCH THE SHOWS I'VE WATCHED CLIPS THOUGHT THE FIGHTS WERE BADASS ESPECIALLY ALL VADER FIGHTS IN REBELS BUT I CAN'T GET OVER THE ART DESIGN IT JUST SEEMS OFF TO ME
IT'S WEIRD THAT ONLY ITEM HERE IS REAL LIFE
I'VE NEVER LIKED THE ART DIRECTION OF THE ANIMATED SHOWS THEY EXAGGERATED TOO MUCH SO MUCH SO THAT IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO WATCH
TERRIBLE ANIMATION
STORM-TROOPER LOOK HORRIBLE IN THE SHOW WHEN COMPARED TO THE FILM I JUST REALIZED THIS
SOMEBODY GIVE THAT SUPER BATTLEDROID A SANDWICH
IF YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO PLAY AS AN SBA THERE IS A MOD CALLED MOVIE BATTLES 2 WHICH HAS A FULL SERVER OF PLAYERS AT SOME LIMES OF THE DAY
ANYBODY ELSE LOVE THE SCOUT TROOPERS IN REBELS
DROID AND CLONE TROOPER ACTUALLY LOOK KINDA COOLER

THE STORM TROOPER LOOKS NOT GREAT LIKE HE HAS A BAD UNDERBITE
I AM SO SORRY BUT THAT CGI STORM-TROOPER IS TOO YEAH

WHAT'S WITH THE EXAGGERATIONS ON THE HELMETS HAHA
I LOVE THE PHASE ACW ARMOR THE SHARP ANGLES ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE CURVE BULLSHIT
LOOK I GET THAT THE FROWN ON A HELMET IS WHERE THE NOSE IS AND IS THEREFORE A NASAL RESPIRATOR OR FILTER OR WHATEVER THE SHIT BUT AFTER ALMOST YEARS OF THE SAME DESIGN WITH NO REFERENCE POINT UNTIL RECENTLY I CANNOT UNSEE IT I DON'T KNOW IF I EVER WILLIAM

THAT SAID I APPRECIATE REBELS EFFORTS PERHAPS IT'LL PAY OFF AND WILL BE SOME KIND OF OF CLARITY TO A NEWER GENERATION OF STAR WARS FANS
I JUST REALIZED THE SBA HAS THE HEAD LODGED INTO ITS CHEST DONECK
I ACTUALLY LIKE THE CLONE AND DROID BUT THAT STEEM TROOPER LOOKS LIKE HE PUT HIS HELMET IN THE DISHWASHER
OKAY THE DROID ON THE RIGHT REMINDS ME OF THE PRECURSOR TECHNOLOGY IN JAK AND BAXTER
THEY'RE ALL GREAT
I PREFER THE PHASE CLONE WAR ANIMATED ARMOR OVER THE ORIGINAL PHASE ARMOR
LOOKS LIKE A WITH A HEAD
YIKES I HAVEN'T STARTED REBELS YET BUT THAT STORM-TROOPER HELMET LOOKS DUMB AS HELL
THE TV STORM-TROOPER ARE HAWAII AS FUCK
I HAVEN'T WATCHED REBELS YET NOR CLONE WARS AND I REALLY LIKE THE LOOK OF THE STORM-TROOPER IN REBELS WHILE I'M NOT REALLY A FAN OF THE REST OF THE ANIMATION
THE FILM VERSIONS LOOK BETTER IN EVERY WAY I'M NOT OF A FAN OF THE WAY THEY STYLISE THINGS IN ACW AND REBELS JUST MAKE THEM THE SAME AS THE FILMS

THE CLONES WERE ALWAYS TOO SKINNY IN ACW
2 BDS ARE TOO TOP HEAVY AND SLENDER IN THE CENTRE
STORM-TROOPER HELMETS IN REBELS ARE TOO BULKY UNDER THE MOUTH
MEMBER STORM-TROOPER
CIRC THERE'S A CANON THING WHERE ACW CLONE ARMOR IS A DIFFERENT VERSION FROM THE EPISODE II ARMOR KIND OF A IN-BETWEEN BETWEEN II AND III
DDK WTF HAPPENED WITH ACW
I DON'T MIND THE CARTOON DESIGNS BUT I MUCH PREFERRED THE TRADITIONAL ANIMATION OF ACW MINISERIES OVER THE TRITE CGI ANIMATION
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MIDDLE ONE I IMAGINE THAT THE DEPICTION ON THE LEFT IS SHAPED SO THAT A HUMAN ACTOR CAN FIT INSIDE THE SUIT
THEY ALL LOOK CARTOON EXCEPT FOR BOTTOM LEFT
NOT I THE MOVIES JUST SPECIFICALLY THIS PICTURE
GOOD GOOD NO GOD NO
DELETED
SAME REASON PEOPLE CALL TISSUES KLEENEX

A CERTAIN BRAND OR MODEL BECOMES SO POPULAR THAT THE NAME JUST STICKS

ALL R SERIES UNITS AFTER THE FOLLOW THE SAME BASIC DESIGN TURNING HEAD BARREL BODY TWO LEGS AND A STABILIZER AND SERIES ARE THE MOST POPULAR WIDESPREAD OUT OF ALL OF THEM SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT NAME WOULD BE ATTACHED TO R SERIES DROIDS
MY HEAD CANON IS THAT ACCENT I EAST NOT HIS SUIT'S LOCALISER BUT RATHER HIS ACTUAL VOICE HAS CHANGED AFTER SOME TWO DECADES OF SERVICE IN THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT ON CORUSCANT SURROUNDED BY THE CORE WORLD ACCENTS OF THE IMPERIAL RULING COUNCIL AND JOINT CHIEFS

PEOPLE ADOPT DIFFERENT ACCENTS OVER LONG PERIODS IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS AT UNIVERSITIES WHEN PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT ACCENTS AND DIALOGUES BEGIN TO HARMONISE
ACCENT DOESN'T SOUND PARTICULARLY BRITISH TO ME EITHER
I NEVER REALLY NOTICED IT TO BE HONEST
JAMES EARL JONES DOESN'T HAVE A BRITISH ACCENT

SOURCE AM BRITISH

EDIT OH YEAH SEBASTIAN SHAW DDK MANUAL EVERYONE AROUND HIM HAS ENGLISH THEATRE ACCENTS SO I GUESS HE PICKED IT UP
I GUESS HE JUST KIND OF PICKED IT UP FROM ALL THE IMPERIAL OFFICERS HE'S CONSTANTLY HANGING AROUND
IF YOU GO BACK AND RECATCH THE FEW LINES THAT SEBASTIAN SHAW HAD HE REALLY DOESN'T PUT TOO MUCH OF AN ENGLISH BENT ON THEM IT'S VAGUE ENOUGH THAT THEY CASTED EITHER AN AMERICAN OR BRIT AS ANAKIN IN THE PREQUEL AND IT MADE ABOUT AS MUCH SENSE WELL AS MUCH SENSE AS ANY PASTY OLD WHITE GUY MAGICALLY SOUNDING LIKE JAMES EARL JONES I GUESS
I NEVER EVEN NOTICED IT BEFORE
IMPERIAL OFFICERS ARE ALWAYS BRITISH
I'LL TAKE IT

THAT'S AWESOME
WAS HOPING BESA WAS GONNA PULL THE HELMET OFF TO REVEAL AHIMSA TO BE JAR JAR BANKS
THAT WAS QUITE GOOD LEGO STOP MOTION REALLY DIG THE SNOW AND MAKING THE BEST OF A LIMITED RANGE OF MOTION
I MEAN I DON'T EVEN LIKE THE PREQUEL BUT CINEMASINS IS UTTER GARBAGE OF THE HIGHEST ORDER THE ABSOLUTE WORST ELEMENTS OF INTERNET FILM CRITICISM ALL STOCKPILED INTO OVERLONG VIDEOS THAT CEASED TO CONTAIN EVEN TRACES OF HUMOR SHORTLY AFTER THEY BEGAN
I DISLIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE BLINDLY BASH SOMETHING BUT I ALSO DISLIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE BLINDLY DEFEND IT I FOR ONE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EVERY STAR WARS FILM HAS ITS UPS AND ITS DOWNS AND I CAN POINT OUT FLAWS WHILE STILL LOVING THE FILM THE SAME FILM THAT HAD THE EWOS ALSO HAD REDEMPTION THE SAME FILM THAT HAD IF YOU'RE NOT WITH ME THEN YOU'RE MY ENEMY ALSO HAD THE TRAGIC AND EMOTIONAL FALL OF A HERO

I ENJOYED THE PREQUEL AND I HAPPILY SIT DOWN TO WATCH THEM AT LEAST ONCE PER YEAR BUT PART OF THE EXPERIENCE OF ENJOYING THEM IS BEING ABLE TO LAUGH AT THEIR STUPIDER PARTS NOW I HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS PARTICULAR VIDEO SINCE IT FIRST CAME OUT SO MAYBE IT'S WORSE THAN I REMEMBER IF IT TRULY IS JUST OH RANDOM BACKGROUND OBJECT MOVED BETWEEN SHOTS THEN I CAN UNDERSTAND SOME EYE-ROLLING

BUT IF NOT THEN OP DO NOT GIVE IN TO YOUR ANGER WALK AWAY CALL THEM FOOLISH IF YOU MUST IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY IT IN YOUR MIND BUT DO NOT GIVE IN DO NOT LET THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS INFLUENCE YOU THIS IS STAR WARS IT IS A GALAXY SO EXPANSIVE THAT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE WAY OF ENJOYING IT OR NOT ENJOYING IT DON'T FOLLOW ANGER WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH JOY TO BE FOUNDATION
HEY GUYS I NOTICED THAT THIS PIECE OF PAPER IN THE BACKGROUND OF THESE SCENE CHANGED POSITION BETWEEN SHOTS I'M A MOOLVIE REVOKER NOW
THIS GUY DOES THIS FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERY MOVIE HE ALSO DID IT FOR THE OT ASWELL AS OTHER MOVIES THAT ARE PRETTY MUCH LOVED BY EVERYONE
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT CINEMA SINS IS THE FUCKING WORST

ITS A SHAME BECAUSE ITS A NICE IDEA FOR A YOUTUBE SERIES BUT IT NEEDS MORE CLEVER PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY CARE
REVENGE OF THE SITH HAD PROBLEMS BUT FUCK CINEMA SINS
YOU SHOULDN'T CARE ABOUT WHAT CINEMASINS SAYS ABOUT MOVIES
ITS BECAUSE IS AORTA A PARODY JOKE
MR PLUNKETT ON YOUTUBE RIPS THE PREQUEL PRETTY BAD IT'S AN INTERESTING WATCH BUT CAN BE WEIRD AT SOME POINTS
LIKE WHAT THEY DO THESE FOR EVERY FILM EVEN JAWS IT'S COMEDY
PRETTY CLINGY HOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS IS SATIRE THEY DO THIS WITH EVERY MOVIE
I DON'T LIKE CINEMA SINS AND I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE TAKE IT AS REAL CRITICISM THESE ARE MADE FOR FUN NOT SUBSTANCE

ALSO REVENGE OF THE SITH IS IN FACT A TRASH FILM SO DON'T GET UPSET WHEN PEOPLE CRITIQUE YOUR AWFUL FILM AND DISAGREE WITH YOU
THE BUTTHURT IS REAL IN THIS THREAD OF IT IS SATIRE COME ON GUYS
BECAUSE SHE WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT DAKAR DIED FROM THE EXPLOSION SHE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT HE WAS THE BOMB THATS WHAT GAVE HER AWAY
THE POWER TO DESTROY A PLANET IS INSIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THE POWER OF THE FORCE A TRAINED JEDI WILL OUTCLASS HAN SOLO SIMILARLY IN REBELS THREE OF THE VERY WELL TRAINED NOT FORCE USERS IN THE CREW WHO GENERALLY HAVE PLOT ARMOR GOT THEIR SHIT HANDED TO THEM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS BY MAUL THE JEDI ARE THE BEST WARRIORS OFFER A SENSE OF HOPE TO DISSIDENTS AND ARE PHILOSOPHICAL RIVALS TO THE SITH THEY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CASTE IN STAR WARS AND IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE

THE DARK SIDE IS THE ANTITHESIS TO THE LIGHT SIDE A PARASITE UPON THE FORCE IT FEEDS OFF OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS LIKE ANGER IF ONE SUCCUMBS THEY ARE CORRUPTED IT'S NOT THE SAME AS A PERSON IN OUR WORLD GETTING GRUMPY AND EASILY CAPABLE OF REGRET AFTER THE FACT THE DARK SIDE CORRUPTS THE VERY BEING OF ANYONE WHO CHOOSES TO USE IT THEY BECOME SLAVES TO THIS PERVASIVE WILL OF DARKNESS

I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE STARKVILLE BASE IT WASN'T A FOCUS OF THE FILM ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE PRESENCE OF A SUPERWEAPON I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED SOME STAR DESTROYERS GOING AND DESTROYING BOSNIAN PRIME AND THEN THE RESISTANCE MOUNTING A COUNTER OFFENSIVE

REY AND HER POWERS WITH WHAT WE HAVE ARE INCONSISTENT BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO BET THAT IN THE NEXT FILMS WE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON WHY AND HOW
WELL I CAN EXPLAIN WHY NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT STARKVILLE BASE AND HOW IT WAS DONE IT WAS BUILT IN THE UNKNOWN REGIONS WHICH MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT'S PRETTY MUCH UNKNOWN IT'S LIKE A THIRD OF THE GALAXY THAT NO ONE HAS EXPLAINED AND IS UNTAPPED EXCEPT SOME PRINT HAVE SPECIES HERE AND THERE ON SOME PLANETS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IS UNCHARTED THERE MINUS A FEW PLACES SO STARKVILLE BASE IS NOT FOUND BECAUSE IT'S BUILT IN A PLACE NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN TO BEFORE THE REASON THE FIRST ORDER GOT THE MATERIALS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE SMALL IS BECAUSE THEY FOUND SOME PLANETS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN DISCOVERED BEFORE FULL OF THE MATERIAL NEEDED SO THEY EXCAVATED THOSE PLANETS THEN THE WORKERS ARE ALL KIDNAPPED AT INFANCY THEY DON'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE SO NO ONE IS GETTING DRUNK AND BABBLING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T LEAVE FIRST ORDER SPACE

ALSO FOR REY I THINK YOU NEED TO WAIT FOR THE OTHER 2 MOVIES TO COME OUT REMEMBER THE NAME OF EPISODE IS THE FORCE AWAKENS AS IN THE FORCE INSIDE REY AWAKENS SHE IS GOING TO BE A SAVIOR TO THE GALAXY AND FOR ALL WE KNOW SHE MIGHT BE AS STRONG OR STRONGER THAN ANAKIN OR YODA OR LUKE IN THE FORCE SHE CAN DO ALL THESE POWERS BECAUSE SHE WAS BORN TO DO IT IT'S LIKE A NATURAL INSTINCT TO HER BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHY YET AND NEITHER DO WE
IT'S A FANTASY MOVIE IN SPACE
THERE DOESN'T NEED TO BE AN EXPLANATION FOR EVERY SINGLE THING LIKE THE SMALL DETAILS OF HOW THE FORCE WORKS IT'S MYSTICAL LIKE MOST FANTASY STORIES ARE FANTASIES IN GENERAL DON'T HAVE TONS OF EXPOSITION BECAUSE IT RUINS THE MAGIC

THERE ARE EXPLANATIONS FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS BUT ALMOST EVERYTHING IN STAR WARS IS RIDICULOUS THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUN THAT'S WHAT IMAGINATION AND WONDER ARE ABOUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CINEMA

IT WOULD BE FUCKING BORING IF ALL MOVIES WERE GROUNDED BY LOGIC AND FACTS
PLEASE TELL YOU ARE TROLLING

SERIOUSLY


THE AGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LUKE AND REY IS ENORMOUS

THE OTHER WAS LEIA
I KNOW YOU SAID YOU ARE SUPER CASUAL WHICH IS FINE BUT EVEN IF YOU ARE SUPER CASUAL YOU SHOULD REALIZE THAT

REY AND LUKE ARE LIKE YEARS APART NO WAY THEY ARE SIBLINGS

2 JJ CORRECTED HIMSELF AND SAID THAT REY DOESN'T DISCOVER HER PARENTS IN FFA THEY MAY BE IN THE FILM BUT REY DOESN'T REALIZE THAT IN THE MOVIE
DUDE YOU DUMB
BANCHA IN HERE

IN THE NEXT MOVIE SAYS THE OTHER IS YOUR SISTER AND LUKE SAYS LEIA
DUDE YOU DUMB
SUPER CASUAL FAN HERE SO GO EASY ON ME

THERE IS ONE MORE FILM CALLED RETURN OF THE JEDI THE ANSWERS YOU SEEK COULD BE FOUND THERE
PRETTY SITE ABRAMS JUST SAID THAT HER PATENTS WEREN'T REVEALED IN THE FILM PEOPLE JUST BLEW IT OUT OF PROPORTION
YOU HAVE A RATHER UNCOMMON THEORY OP THIS IS TRUE BUT SORRY FOR THE RUDE REPLIES DON'T LET THIS PLACE DRIVE YOU AWAY FROM THE SERIES WE ALL HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE AND ASK QUESTIONS
IF LUCASFILM BURIES THE PREQUEL THEN STAR WARS WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD AS IT COULD BE THOSE MOVIES DID AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF WORLD BUILDING

2 THE DEATH STAR WAS BEING BUILT DURING THE CLONE WARS THERE'S EVEN A SCRAPPED ACW EPISODE THAT REVOLVED AROUND SIMIOUS SHIPPING A GIGANTIC GYBER CRYSTAL TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE
ALSO LCL IS NOT BURYING THE PREQUEL THEY ARE REFERENCED CONTINUOUSLY IN THE COMICS AND NOVELS
READ CATALYST SERIOUSLY IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING IN FACT THAT SCENE IS REFERENCED IN THE BOOK AS IT HAPPENS
IT'S NOT DISNEY IT'S LUCASFILM AND IN NO WAY ARE THEY BURYING THE PREQUEL THEY'VE ALREADY EXPLAINED THAT THEY BUILT THE SPACE STATION QUICKLY BUT IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO PERFECT THE WEAPON
THE CONSTRUCTION ACTUALLY BEGINS DURING THE WAR BUT COMPLETING THE REST OF THE STATION TAKES A LONG TIME YES
IN MY HEADCANON THE DS IN ROTS WAS A PROTOTYPE YOU'D EXPECT A SUPERWEAPON TO RUN THROUGH VARIOUS TEST PHASES BUT YEAH HEADCANON
THE DEATH STAR BEGAN CONSTRUCTION DURING THE CLONE WARS SO A LOT OF IT WAS ALREADY DONE BY THE TIME REVENGE OF THE SITH WAS OVER AND IT'S DURING ROGUE ONE MOST LIKELY READ CATALYST EXCELLENT BOOK THAT WILL GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT ON HOW THE DS CAME TO BE AS EARLY AS THE PREQUEL ERA
THERE'S NOTHING TO RECONCILE READ CATALYST THE DEATH STAR WAS IN DEVELOPMENT DURING THE CLONE WARS
ADAMIK THE OLD EU EXPLANATION WAS THAT THE GALAXY WAS DEVASTATED AFTER THE WAR AND THAT THEY HAD MULTIPLE PROBLEMS AND A LACK OF EXPERIENCE REGARDING BUILDING SUPERWEAPONS IN ROTC THE CIVIL WAR WAS STILL KINDA SMALL IN SCALE AND THE EMPIRE WAS STABLE AND POWERFUL SO THE TIME SPENT IN BUILDING WAS MUCH SHORTER
WELL THEY'D HAVE TO PUT HIM IN HELL HE'S BOBA IN SW BATTLEFRONT
I'D RATHER A BOSK MOVIE
ASSUMING A BOBA FETT FILM MAY STILL BE IN THE CARDS WHICH I'M DOUBTFUL ABOUT ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE MOMENTUM ABOUT THE POTENTIAL BEN KENOBI FILM INSTEAD BUT EVEN IF THERE WAS A BOBA FETT FILM THERE WAS A RUMOURED SETUP FOR THE FILM COOKED UP LAWRENCE KAJDAN WHICH RESULTED IN TEMPERA MORRISON ONLY BEING IN THE MOVIE FOR LIKE MINUTES
I'M GOING TO WAIT UNTIL I KNOW THEY'RE NOT RELATED
I THINK THERE'S CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING
I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT IN THE WORDS OF JENNY SCHECTER IT S NOT MY JOB TO MAKE YOU A BETTER MAN AND I DON T GIVE A SHIT IF I VE MADE YOU A BETTER MANUAL IT S NOT A FUCKING WOMAN S JOB TO BE CONSUMED AND INVADED AND SPAT OUT SO THAT SOME FUCKING MAN CAN EVOLVE
I THINK IT'S A POSSIBILITY BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN
WAIT A MINUTE PEOPLE ARE SHIPPING REY AND KALO REN
DO PEOPLE EVEN STOP TO THINK BEFORE THEY SPEW CRAP OUT AT THIS POINT
HONESTLY I THINK WITH ENOUGH DEVELOPMENT MAYBE NOT SURE IF IT IS THE BEST WAY TO GO HOWEVER
NO AND IT SHOULDN'T
US BY THE TIME TICKET INFO ARRIVES PROBABLY
SERIOUSLY THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION ON TICKETS IS REALLY STARTING TO WEAR ON ME
THEY ACTUALLY HAD NEW FOOTAGE
THIS MIGHT BE THE STAR WARS FILM YET EDWARDS AND THE WHOLE CREW HAVE CLEARLY DONE AN AMAZING JOB
PROTID NEVER USE DEMONSTRATIVE THIS THAT THESE OR THOSE IN YOUR POST TITLE IT MAKES PEOPLE THINK OF CLICKBAIT AND TURNS THEM OFFICIAL
HE STILL WORKS I THOMPSON GT THOSE GUYS WOULD SWIM IN ALL OF THAT PHOTOSHOP MONEY
BADASS
WOW A REAL UNDERACHIEVER HUH
LOVE ME SOME REVENGE
WHICH MODS
IT SEEMS LIKE BY EMOTION THEY GENERALLY MEAN FUELED BY ANGER OR SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT I COULD EASILY SEE A SITH USING SEX OR LUST TO FURTHER THEIR OWN GOALS
ANAKIN WOULD BE THE CLOSEST GIVEN HIS ACTIONS WERE ALL ABOUT SAVING FADME BUT THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT IT WASN'T THE LOVE THAT GAVE HIM POWER IT WAS THE FEAR OF LOSING HER
THE DARK SIDE ROMANCE FOR JAELA WILLSAAM KINDA EXPLORED THOSE THEMES

SITH CAN ABSOLUTELY DRAW STRENGTH FROM ALL OF THEIR PASSIONS THEY'RE NOT AFRAID TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE SHALL FREE THEM

THAT SAID THERE'S A HIERARCHY OF VALUE AND USEFULNESS OF EMOTIONS IN SITH CULTURE SITH LORDS LOOK DOWN ON USING FEAR AS A POWER SOURCE ONLY BOOBS NEED TO RELY ON FEAR ANGER IS A GOOD ALL PURPOSE FUEL HATE IS THE MOST MATURE AND REFINED

LOVE AND LUST ARE WEIRD ONES WHILE SITH MAY BE GREAT IN BED ASSUMING THE IMPORTANT BITS HAVEN'T SHRIVELLED UP FROM TOO MUCH FORCE LIGHTNING THEY'RE NOT REALLY INTO THE COMMITMENT THING LOVE LEADS TO ATTACHMENT ATTACHMENT LEADS TO VULNERABILITY VULNERABILITY LEADS TO WEAKNESS ALSO FOR A DARKSIDER EMOTIONAL DRIVERS RELATING TO LOVED ONES TEND TO RETURN TO THE BIG OF LOSING THEM ANGER AT HURTING THEM HATRED FOR THOSE THAT WOULD TAKE THEM FROM YOU IT'S A COMMON THEME AMONG SITH MOTIVATED BY LOVE EAST G DARTH VADER OR DARTH MAGUS

IT WOULDN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE SITH BY THEIR VERY NATURE CARE ONLY ABOUT THEMSELVES AND POWER
IN THE OLD REPUBLIC GAME DARTH SLAVE SERVANT SEEN IN THE DECEIVED TRAILER IS HIS LOVER HE LOVED HER DEEPLY AND ABSOLUTELY DRAWING STRENGTH FROM THAT CONNECTION THOUGH EVENTUALLY HE HAD TO KILL HER WHEN HE REALIZED THAT SHE WAS ALSO HIS WEAKNESS SOMEONE COULD GET TO HIM THROUGH HERALDRY

DARTH CADUS FROM THE LEGACY OF THE FORCE NOVELS FUELED HIS ENTIRE PURPOSE IN BECOMING A SITH BASICALLY OUT OF A SENSE OF JUSTICE AND SACRIFICE BECOMING A SITH FOR THE GREATER GOOD AND TO HELP CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER MOST OF WHAT HE DID HE DID OUT OF LOVE FOR THEM

WHILE ABSOLUTELY FUELED BY RAGE THE LEGACY DARTH TALON USED HER SEXUALITY AS A TOOL AGAINST THE FORMER JEDI CADE SKYWALKER AT THE TIME CAPTURED BY THE ONE SITH EMPIRE AND PRETENDING TO HAVE JOINED THEM IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE TALON HAVING LONG BEEN SOMETHING OF A RIVAL TO CADE BECAME HIS MENTOR IN THE ONE SITH AND EVEN SLEPT WITH HIM ONE NIGHT IT WAS AFTER SLEEPING WITH HIM THAT SHE REALIZED THAT WHILE HE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HIS COVER HE STILL HAD YET TO GIVE HIMSELF TO THE DARK SIDE
SEX OR LUST I COULD SEE LOVE NOT SO MUCH BUT SURE WHY NOT SEX IS USED TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME
ANAKIN WAS INITIALLY DRIVEN BY ROMANCE BUT ANGER AND HATE SEEM TO ALWAYS TAKE OVER
SADLY WE WILL NEVER KNOW SINCE DISNEY INSISTS THAT EVERYTHING BE KID FRIENDLY
I THINK THE META REASON IS THAT SHOWING THE SITH USING SEX OR LUST TO GAIN POWER IS KINDA OR VERY DRAPEY AND THE DREW THE LINE AT RAPE I THINK IT WAS A GOOD DECISION LOVE DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE OF THE SELF-CENTERED NATURE OF THE SITH
REMOVED
YOU CAN TELL ONE PARENT REALLY WANTED LUKE BUT HAD TO SETTLE WITH LUCAS OR THERE'D BE WAR
I ACTUALLY KNOW A KID NAMED LUKE SKY WALKER IT'S A CLIENT'S NEPHEW HE'S NOW LOVES STAR WARS BECAUSE WHAT OTHER CHOICE DOES HE HAVE
MY SON'S NAME IS LUCAS MY WIFE BELIEVES WE NAMED HIM FROM LUKE IN THE BIBLE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS THINKING AT ALL WHEN I SUGGESTED IT

ME WHAT ABOUT LUCAS

WIFE LUCAS I LIKE THAT LIKE LUKE MY FAVORITE BOOK OF THE BIBLE

ME UH SURE THE BIBLE RIGHT

A FEW MONTHS LATER I'M HOLDING MY NEWBORN SON

ME GHHHHH SHKUUUUU LUKE I AM YOUR FATHER
MY SON WILL BE BORN IN A FEW WEEKS WE WERE ORIGINALLY GOING TO CALL HIM LUCAS BUT INSTEAD WE SETTLED ON HARRISON AND AS A BONUS HIS MIDDLE NAME WILL LIKELY BE WAN MY WIFE'S MAIDEN NAME IT WAS EVEN HER IDEA
I HAVE A YEAR OLD NAMED ADALIA WHO WE CALL LEIA

OUR SECOND DAUGHTER WHO IS NOT JUST OVER A MONTH OLD IS REYLYNN WONDER WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CALL HER
HE SHOULD BE WEARING AN EVEN SMALLER PACK ON HIS BACK WITH A MINI YODA IN IT
I REMEMBER SEEING A KID WHO'S NAME WAS ANAKIN
LOL CRYSTAL CITY IS LIKE MIN FOR WHERE I LIVE IN STL
THIS IS NOT THE BOY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
THEY MESSED UP THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST DROPPED THE S FROM SKY
THAT POOR KID EVEN AS A MIDDLE NAME SKY IS FEMININE
THE FANFARE IS FROM THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK SOUNDTRACK THAT THEY ADDED DURING THE DIGITAL RELEASE
I AGREE THAT THE WAY THEY HANDLED IT IN FORCE AWAKENS WAS BETTER THE WAY THE FANFARE WAS EDITED FOR THE OTHER FILMS WAS PRETTY SLOPPY SILENCE IS BETTER
BECAUSE SOME EPISODES AREN'T IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER YOU'RE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO WATCH FIRST AND THEN THERE'S OR EPISODES BETWEEN THAT AND WATCHING

NEWS

THE ISSUE ABOUT HOW THE EPISODES AIRED IS COVERED IN THE FAQ I BELIEVE IF YOU WANT MORE INFO
R STARWARD COMMENTS

I USE THIS
BUT ANAKIN HAS AN APPRENTICE HOW WHEN HE IS NEVER A MASTER
CIRC IT'S NOT A CHRONOLOGY ISSUE EVERYTHING AFTER SEASON IS BROADCAST IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER THEY'RE JUST TWO DIFFERENT JEDI OF THE SAME SPECIES
I'M ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH IT NOW AND REALLY ENJOYING IT IT'S A GREAT BIT OF WORLD BUILDING
LIKING IT SO FAR HIS GALEN AND KRENNIC ARE BOTH AMAZING
YES HE HAS A GREAT VOICE I ESPECIALLY LOVE LISTENING TO HIS PORTRAYAL OF GALEN
YEAH JONATHAN DAVIES IS FANTASTIC AND HE IS THE SAME GUY WHO DID A LOT OF THE NOW NO LONGER CANON BOOKS LIKE THE DARTH BANE TRILOGY AND THE OBI WAN AUDIOBOOKS AND THOSE WERE REALLY GREAT

TSH SO FAR FOR PRETTY MUCH ALL THE NEW CANON AUDIOBOOKS THEY HAVE USED THE SAME GREAT VOICE ACTORS OF THE OLD CANON BOOKS LIKE MARC THOMPSON WHO DID AMONG OTHERS THE THRAWN TRILOGY AUDIOBOOKS AND HE ALREADY A FEW OF NEW CANON BOOKS TOO BTW AND I GOT GOOD HOPES HE WILL DO THE AUDIOBOOK VERSION OF THE NEW THRAWN BOOK COMING UP TOO
I FINISHED IT LAST NIGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST AUDIO BOOKS I HAVE LISTENED TOO IN A WHILE I REALLY HELPED FILL OUT THE WORLD AND THAT PERIOD IN STAR WARS HISTORY
I LOVE IT AS WELL I HAVE ABOUT HOURS LEFT REALLY GREAT FOR DRIVES TO CLASS AND BACK IT IS EXPONENTIALLY INCREASING MY EXCITEMENT FOR ROGUE ONE
WHAT DOES IT SAY ALSO WHICH AREA OF THE ALPS WERE YOU IN I LOVE IT UP THERE
PERHAPS WE SHOULD CREATE A REBELLION TO STEAL THESE SECRET PLANS
I CAN ONLY SEE THIS GETTING BORING IF THEY STICK TO THE OT TIMELINE AS MUCH AS I LIKE IT THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO HOPE THEY DIVE INTO PREQUEL ERA ANCIENT ERAS AND PRE FORCE AWAKENS
NEED MORE STAR WARS GAMES NEED MORE STAR WARS STRATEGY GAMES MORE RAGS MORE STAR WARS GALAXIES MORE FLYING GAMES
THEY MAY LEAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS ON THE TABLE FOR STAND ALONE FILMS WITH THE MAKING OF EPISTLE VIII AND IX OR POSSIBLE EVENTS THAT TAKE PLACE AFTER THOSE FILMS THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT KIND OF CHARACTERS WILL EMERGE IN THOSE FILMS AND IF THEY GENERATE ENOUGH INTEREST IN THE FANS THEN YOU HAVE YOUR NEXT FEW POSSIBLE FILMS IDEAS FROM THAT
I LOVE HOW ALL THESE SITES ARE TRYING TO MAKE A MEAL OUT OF SIMPLE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AFTER EPISODE IX BUT WE'LL START TALKING ABOUT THAT IN JANUARY AFTER WE SEE HOW ROGUE ONE DOES STATEMENT

IT'S PROBABLY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT DEPENDING ON HOW ROGUE ONE PERFORMS LUCASFILM WILL EITHER FEEL EMBOLDENED TO START CREATING MORE ANTHOLOGY FILMS AND OR NEW STAR WARS FILM SERIES THAT DON'T INVOLVE THE SKYWALKERS OR THEY'LL START MULLING THE IDEA OF MAKING EPISODES
JUST MAKE A KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC MOVIE
OKAY PEOPLE ARE GOING APESHIT OVER ROGUE ONE NOW HEAR ME OUT ROGUE TWO LUCASFILM
I NEED A SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE FILM IN MY LIFE
ONCE EP IS COMPLETE THERE'S NO REASON THEY CAN'T GO BACK AND SHOW THE BATTLE OF ZAKKEU

I WANT TO SEE THOSE STAR DESTROYERS SINK THAT'S A HUGE UNTOLD STORY
JUST GIVE ME AN MOVIE OR AND I'LL DIE HAPPY
I WANT A MANDALORIAN WARS MOVIE SO BAD
SEE HERE'S WHERE I DISAGREE WITH KENNEDY SHE SAYS THEY LIKELY WON'T HAVE A CRAWL IN ROGUE ONE SO THESE STANDALONES TO MOVE AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL THINGS IN STAR WARS FILMS THAT I'M OKAY WITH I DON'T NEED AN I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS IN EVERY FILM

BUT TO ME AN OPENING CRAWL IS NOT ONLY A PINNACLE OF THE SAGA BUT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE FOR ROGUE ONE THAN ANY OTHER FILM IN THE SERIES THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT STILL THINK THIS FILM IS EPISODE VIII AND WILL BE CONFUSED FOR THE FIRST MINUTES OF THE MOVIE TO ME A CRAWL WOULD SET UP EXACTLY THE INFO THEY NEED TO KNOW

MAYBE THEY HAVE A BETTER WAY TO CONVEY THE TIMELINE IN THE FILM BUT THIS IS JUST MY OPINION HAVING NOT SEEN THE FILM YET
I REALLY WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE PIRATES THAT APPEARED IN AFTERMATH
THE SHOULD DO A FILM WHERE THE HEROIC MEN AND WOMEN OF THE EMPIRE MUST STOP REBEL TERRORISTS FROM ASSASSINATING THE EMPEROR
BE READY FOR DISNEY TO PUT OUT SO MUCH STAR WARS THAT EVERYBODY LOSES INTEREST
UNRELATED BUT WHEN THE VIDEO STARTED PLAYING AUTOMATICALLY I HAVE NEVER JUMPED THAT HARD
I DON'T THINK THE FLOW OF NEW STAR WARS MOVIES WILL EVER END SAME FOR THE HARRY POTTER UNIVERSE THEY SO BIG AND DEEP THAT YOU CAN KEEP TELLING NEW STORIES FOREVER
HONESTLY IF THEY JUST DID KOROR IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE SUCCESS THEY COULD EASILY SPREAD IT INTO MOVIES AND THEN EASILY JUMP TO A ABOUT EVANS ORIGINS THEN IT WOULD BE DARTH BEVAN AS THE FOCUS INSTEAD OF VADER
FORCE SENSITIVE CREATURES AND WHERE TO FIND THEM

STAR WARS ORCINS YODA

RISE OF THE SHROUD OF THE DARKSIDE

GREED A HUNTERS TALE

THE MAGICAL DUNGAN MUSICAL
GIVE ME A FILM OF VADER AND PALATINE TRACKING DOWN THE REMAINING JEDI
REALLY HOPE WE GET A DOCUMENTARY ON MIDICHLORIANS I'M KIDDING LUCAS IF YOU'RE READING THIS THAT'S A JOKE
I WANT

BOBA FETT IN HIS PRIME

POST ROTS

BOOTS ON THE GROUND CLONE WARS
WAIT I'VE GOT IT PLANET KILLING SPACE STATION ONLY IT'S GOT A WEAKNESS THAT THE HEROES CAN USE TO DESTROY IT
CAN THEY WORK ON A NEW STAR WARS RPG INSTEAD
I WOULD KILL FOR A PLAGUERS MOVIE
DAMN WELL BETTER BE A KENOBI FILM IN THERE STARRING EWAN MCGREGOR IF THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP MAKING THESE FILMS I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING SET ON TATTOOING DURING SELF-IMPOSED EXILE WATCHTOWER YEARS SPECIFICALLY AN INTERACTION BETWEEN HIM AND LARS OWEN WHO IN MY MOVIE THEATER I SEE BEING PLAYED BY RUSSELL CROWE WASN'T THERE A NOVEL THAT COVERED THIS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE TUSKERS
FOR ANYONE THINKING THAT THEY WON'T CONTINUE WITH THE MAIN EPISODIC CHAPTERS AFTER IX YOU'RE KIDDING YOURSELVES

SKYWALKER IS A BRAND JUST LIKE MICKEY MOUSE CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MANUAL

THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO LET THAT BRAND FADE OFF INTO THE BINARY SUNSET AND THEY SHOULDN'T

AND BESIDE AS A FAN GROWING UP WITH THE OT PT AND NOW THE STREET I WANT TO SEE THE CONTINUING ADVENTURES OF THE SKYWALKER FAMILY

AS WELL ALL THE OTHER STORIES THAT CAN BE TOLD OUTSIDE THE EPISODES

I WANT IT ALL


STOP FOCUSING ON ANYONE IMPORTANT FOR A WHILE AND JUST EXPLORE THE UNIVERSE

COME UP WITH SOME INTERESTING BUT UNIMPORTANT SCHLUMPS SMUGGLERS BEING THE STAR WARS EU STAPLE AND SEND THEM ON STUPID ADVENTURES GIVE THEM A BATTERED OLD SHIP WITH A MEANINGFUL NAME SO OLD THAT NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS WOULD STILL BE USING MAKE A FEW OF THEM WAR VETERANS

GET THEM TRAVELLING THE GALAXY OUT ON THE FRONTIERS A SORT OF SPACE WESTERN VIBE THEY COULD DO SPICE RUNS A TRAIN ROBBERY AND MAYBE SOME INTERESTING PASSENGERS COULD JOIN THEM MAYBE AN INCOGNITO JEDI EXILE JUST POSING AS AN OLD PREACHER MAYBE A DOCTOR AND HIS SISTER WHO ARE FLEEING IMPERIAL CUSTODY

WHAT DO YOU MEAN ISN'T THAT JUST FIREFLY
HERE'S MY PREDICTION AFTER EP

OBI WAN MOVIE PT
BOUNTY HUNTERS UNDERWORLD MOVIE W BOBA FETT
OBI WAN MOVIE PT 2
BATTLE OF ZAKKEU
OBI WAN MOVIE PT
WOULD LOVE TO SEE A MOVIE BETWEEN EPISODE AND 2 THEY SKIPPED OVER A HUGE CHUNK OF CANAKINS LIFE ESPECIALLY HOW HE BECAME SO CLOSE TO AND TRUSTING OF PALATINE IN EPISODE THEY MEET ONCE CIRC AND PALATINE SHOWS INTEREST IN HIS CAREER THEN IN EARLY EPISODE 2 ANAKIN PRAISES PALATINE AS A MENTOR AND A GOOD MANUAL I FEEL LIKE WE MISS OUT ON SOME SIGNIFICANT MANIPULATION THAT MIGHT MAKE CANAKINS TURN MORE BELIEVABLE
FOR ALL I CARE THEY RUN THROUGH ALL OF THE NUMBERS AT THE BACK OF THE OLD KENNER TOYS
NEXT UP LOM
I'M AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THE FRANCHISE INTO THE GROUND I ALREADY FEEL LIKE THERE'S TOO MANY STAR WARS MOVIES COMING AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT MORE WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE NEW TRILOGY BY ITSELF AND THEN A BREAK FOR A WHILE BEFORE EXPANDING TO OTHER TYPES OF MOVIES AND TIME PERIODS
DARTH BANE PLEASE
IS ANYONE ELSE WORRIED THEY'RE GOING TO TURN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE INTO THE SAME MASS PRODUCED MARVEL MOVIE SERIES MOVIES IN YEARS THAT WE HAVE TODAY
I WOULD REALLY DIG A PODRACER MOVIE GET RID OF THE KIDDY SHIT AND MAKE A STRAIGHT-UP INTENSE RACING MOVIE STARRING A BUNCH OF BADASS CHARACTERS WHO GET MAIMED AND KILLED IN VARIOUS GALACTIC COURSES
I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BE OVER SATURATED WITH STAR WARS IN I WAS YEARS OLD WHEN ROTC CAME OUT AND WAITED YEARS FOR THE PREQUEL WITH A STEADY DIET OF DARK HORSE COMICS AND EU NOVELS

IF THEY DO NOT GET EWAN MCGREGOR BACK AS OBI WAN IT WILL BE A DAMN TRAVESTY HAVE HIM AND MAUL FINISH WHAT THEY STARTED IN BABOO EDIT SOME LIVE ACTION FLASHBACKS FROM THE CLONE WARS CARTOON DUCHESS SATINE KRYZE ANYBODY

I HAVE HIGH HOPES THAT THIS WORKS OUT AND WE GET STAR WARS EVERY YEAR FOR A LONG TIME
DOES ANYONE HAVE A NON SHITTY TO MOBILE SITE
MORE VADER PEOPLE WANT VADER ALSO IF THEY COULD MAKE ONE ABOUT BEVAN IT'D BE AWESOME THAT A SOMETHING LIKE ON HBO
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE CROSSING MY FINGERS FOR OLD REPUBLIC ERA MAKE BEVAN CANON AND YOU CAN HAVE MY SOUL
GIVE ME SOMETHING OLD REPUBLIC STYLE I'M PRETTY DONE WITH THE ORIGINAL CAST AND HAVING THE SAME TRILOGY TIMES IN DIFFERENT WAYS
ROGUE SQUADRON MOVIE TV SERIES GAME PRETTY PLEASE
OLD REPUBLIC PLEASE I WANT TO SEE HORDES OF JEDI AND SITH FIGHTING
I I GIB PREQUEL ERA I I PLEASE
SO SECRET IT'S ON REDDIN KNOWN FOR IT'S SECRECY
I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD MAKE TOO MANY FILMS OTHERWISE IT WOULD GET BORING AND REPETITIVE AND I DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO MY FAVOURITE FRANCHISE OF ALL TIME UNFORTUNATELY I SUSPECT LOVE OF MONEY TO GET IN THE WAY OF THAT IF I WAS IN CHARGE I WOULD PUT STAR WARS ON THE BACK-BURNER AFTER EPISTLE IX SOME BOOKS GAMES MAYBE A COUPLE TV SHOWS BUT NO MAJOR MOVIE RELEASES FOR SOME TIME
GOOD LET'S KEEP IT A SECRET I WANT SURPRISES NOT SPOILERS
CHEWBACCA THE MOVIE

ORIGIN STORY

THE RECKONING

THAT BOUNTY HUNTER WITH ALL THE BANDAGES HE GETS A MOVIE TOO

AND THAT BIG WORM IN AN ASTEROID THE FILM IN 3D
MANY BETHANKS DIED TO BRING US THIS INFORMATION
IS THERE A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO THE OVERALL STORY IF THEY SPAM MOVIES AS OPPOSED TO NOVELS

I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SEE A MOVIE MADE ABOUT BEVAN AND OTHER STORIES FROM THE OLD REPUBLIC PROBABLY WONT MAKE THOSE UNTIL AFTER THEY FINISH THE NEW TRILOGY I'M GUESSING
SO YOU KNOW HOW THE SECOND EARTHSTAR WAS DESTROYED IN EPISODE WHAT IF FOR EPISODE YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS THEY BUILD ANOTHER EARTHSTAR

STANDING OVATION FROM BOARDROOM
I WANT A TO SEE THE RISE OF A YOUNG SHEE PALATINE
IT MAKES SENSE EWAN MCGREGOR HAS MOST LIKELY BEEN IN CONTACT WITH LUCASFILM TO REPRISE HIS OBI WAN ROLE

THEY'RE JUST WAITING TO SEE HOW WELL THIS FIRST ANTHOLOGY FILM ROLLS OUT I'D BET GOOD MONEY THAT IF THE RETURNS ARE GREAT WE'LL GET AN ANNOUNCEMENT EARLY NEXT YEAR REGARDING AN OBI WAN FILM

EWAN MCGREGOR PARTICIPATED IN AN INTERVIEW EARLIER THIS YEAR AND COULDN'T COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT HE HAD TALKS WITH LUCASFILM OR DISNEY

EVERYONE KNOWS WHEN AN ACTOR SAYS NOT SURE IF I CAN TALK ABOUT THAT THAT IT'S AN INDIRECT CONFIRMATION OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE FLAT OUT SAID NUMBER
I WANT TO SEE AN ORDER MOVIE IT CAN'T HAVE BEEN THAT SHORT I WANT TO SEE THE JEDI RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES
AS LONG AS THERE IS AT LEAST ONE STAR WARS FILM EVERY YEAR FROM NOW UNTIL THE END OF TIME I WILL BE HAPPY ALTHOUGH I DO THINK THAT HAVING TRILOGIES BE THE CONTINUING ANCHOR IS KEY
SECRET PLANS

WASN'T IT COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT DISNEY WOULD RELEASE A NEW STAR WARS MOVIE EVERY YEAR UNTIL AUDIENCES WERE ABSOLUTELY SICK OF THE FRANCHISE
CROSS-FINGER SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE TOM HARDY COULD PLAY A BADASS DASH REIDAR
MOVIE INCOMING
ROGUE ONE FEVER IS UP CHECK THIS INSANE LIFE SIZE REPLICA
WE NEED SOME BETHANKS TO RISK THEIR LIVES FOR THE SECRET MOVIE PLANS
IS ANYONE ELSE SUPER WORRIES THIS MAY SUCK I HAVE A FRIEND CALLING IT KATNISS STEALS THE DEATH STAR PLANS IT LOOKS SUPER FORMULAIC
YAY ANOTHER YEARLY FRANCHISE
ONLY RELEASED 2 KINDA MOVIES AND I FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE ALREADY OVER SATURATED THE MARKET THEY HAVE THE NEW TRILOGY EPISTLE AND THE ANTHOLOGY SERIES ROUGE ONE HAN SOLO AND A THIRD ONE THAT'S ALREADY MOVIE PER YEAR TO AND NOW THEY WANT TO DO MORE I LOVE STAR WARS AS MUCH AS THE NEXT PERSON BUT TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING CAN BE RUINED I SUGGEST THEY SLOW DOWN AND LET THIS CURRENT STRING RUN ITS COURSE AND TAKE A FEW YEARS OFF BEFORE DIVING INTO MORE FODDER
JAR JAR ORIGIN STORY LZ
DID MANY BETHANKS DIE
NO WHITE MEN LEADS

2 SEE
BOY ROGUE ONE REALLY IS LOOMING HUH

TIME TO PUT R STARWARD BACK ON FILTER
I'M BETTING THEY'LL FOLLOW THE MARVEL PLAN OF TWO MOVIES A YEAR AND ONE OF THESE NEW MOVIES IS GOING TO BE THE SEQUEL TO ROGUE ONE THEY'LL PROBABLY RELEASE THEIR SLATE OF MOVIES SOMETIME IN AND IT'LL RIVAL THE MARVEL RELEASES

VERY EXCITING POSSIBILITIES
UNDERNAME CHECKS OUT
MINUTES OF BOOKIE TALK
I JUST WATCHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY I DON'T PLAN ON VIEWING IT EVER AGAIN
SCREAMING INTERNALLY
I SAW IT WHEN IT FIRST AIRED EVERYONE WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS THINKING IT WAS GOING TO BE TOTALLY BADASS IF IT'S STAR WARS THERE'S NO WAY THIS WOULD BE BAD THEN WE SAW IT ICK I REMEMBER WATCHING IT AND THINKING IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER NOPE


I WATCH THIS EVERY CHRISTMAS WITH MY FAMILY
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS REVIEW OF THE HOLIDAY SPECIAL YOU'RE MISSING OUT
NEVER
DEAR GOD KEEP THAT THING AWAY FROM ME BEFORE IT EATS MY SOUL
JESUS CHRIST KILL IT WITH FIRE
IT'S LIKE A FRACTAL OF UNCOMFORTABLE FAILURE
I THINK SOME ARTIST DID IT FOR FUN
SOME RANDOM ARTIST IT KEEPS POPPING UP BECAUSE OF SOME BOGUS POOR MANS BUZZFEED SITE KEEP ADVERTISING IT AS SOME ARTICLE ABOUT A YOUNG YODA STANDALONE FILM
HE LOOKS LIKE A NINJA TURTLE GOT DUMPED IN A VAT OF VASELINE LAO
ROGUE ONE IS A STANDALONE STORY MEANING YOU CAN GO IN CLEAN IT'S NOT A SEQUEL IT'S A PREQUEL OF SORTS TO EPISODE IV A NEW HOPE BUT IT'S ITS OWN STORY

AS FOR WATCHING ORDER YOU'LL GET TWO SUGGESTIONS THE RELEASE LINE AND THE CHRONOLOGICAL LINE OR SOMETHING SIMILAR

THE CHRONOLOGICAL LINE WOULD BE

EPISODE THE PHANTOM MENACE

EPISODE 2 ATTACK OF THE CLONES

STAR WARS THE CLONE WARS MOVIE

STAR WARS THE CLONE WARS SERIES

EPISODE REVENGE OF THE SITH

STAR WARS REBELS TV SERIES

HERE IS WHERE ROGUE ONE FITS IN

EPISODE A NEW HOPE

EPISODE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK

EPISODE RETURN OF THE JEDI

EPISODE THE FORCE AWAKENS


THE RELEASE ORDER IS HOW THEY WERE RELEASED ORIGINALLY

EPISODE A NEW HOPE

EPISODE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK

EPISODE RETURN OF THE JEDI

EPISODE PHANTOM MENACE

EPISODE 2 ATTACK OF THE CLONES

EPISODE REVENGE OF THE SITH

STAR WARS CLONE WARS MOVIE

STAR WARS CLONE WARS SERIES

EPISODE FORCE AWAKENS

STAR WARS REBELS TV SERIES

IT'S TRULY UP TO YOU BUT REST ASSURED YOU CAN GO INTO ROGUE ONE WITH NO EXPERIENCE WITH ANY STAR WARS MOVIE AND STILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND EXPERIENCE AN ENTIRE STORY ON ITS OWN
IT TAKES PLACE BEFORE EPISODE WHICH IS THE FIRST STAR WARS MOVIE SO YOU SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO IF IT'S YOUR FIRST ONE
YOU SHOULD BE FINE GOING IN NOT KNOWING SHIT ABOUT STAR WARS IN FACT I THINK MOST PEOPLE AROUND HERE WOULD BE CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS FILM WITHOUT HAVING ANY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT STAR WARS ESPECIALLY IF YOU DECIDE TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS FILM AFTER SEEING ROGUE ONE SINCE THAT FIRST STAR WARS MOVIE SUPPOSEDLY TAKES PLACE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EVENTS OF ROGUE ONE
THEY'RE SHOWING ALL SIX STAR WARS MOVIES ON TBS IF YOU HAVE THAT CHANNEL TOMORROW I RECOMMEND CHECKING YOUR GUIDE TO SEE WHAT TIME THEY AIR FOR YOU
YOU'LL BE FINE IT DOESN'T REALLY GET INTO THE JEDI SITH CONFLICT AND THE FORCE ISN'T PROMINENT IT'LL BE MORE LIKE A SCI-FI MO IS THAT THE TRADITIONAL SPACE OPERA

AND AS U MIDIRON MENTIONED YOU SHOULD GO SEE ROGUE ONE AND THEN GATHER UP ANOTHER ROOST ON HERE DESCRIBING YOUR EXPERIENCE OF ROGUE ONE BEING YOUR FIRST STAR WARS FILM WE'D ALL BE VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT IT
AT MINIMUM I WOULD WATCH REVENGE OF THE SITH AND A NEW HOPE IN THAT ORDER I ENCOURAGE WATCHING ALL OF THE MOVIES THOUGH CHRONOLOGICALLY
PLO KOON HE WAS ALWAYS MY FAVORITE JEDI AND THEN ACW SHOWED HIM FOR THE TOTALLY CHILL GUY HE ACTUALLY IS PLUS HE'S A JEDI ACE
DID YOU EVER HEAR THE TRAGEDY OF DARTH PLAGUERS THE WISE I THOUGHT NOT IT'S NOT A STORY THE JEDI WOULD TELL YOU IT'S A SITH LEGEND DARTH PLAGUERS WAS A DARK LORD OF THE SITH SO POWERFUL AND SO WISE HE COULD USE THE FORCE TO INFLUENCE THE MIDICHLORIANS TO CREATE LIFE HE HAD SUCH A KNOWLEDGE OF THE DARK SIDE THAT HE COULD EVEN KEEP THE ONES HE CARED ABOUT FROM DYING THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE IS A PATHWAY TO MANY ABILITIES SOME CONSIDER TO BE UNNATURAL HE BECAME SO POWERFUL THE ONLY THING HE WAS AFRAID OF WAS LOSING HIS POWER WHICH EVENTUALLY OF COURSE HE DID UNFORTUNATELY HE TAUGHT HIS APPRENTICE EVERYTHING HE KNEW THEN HIS APPRENTICE KILLED HIM IN HIS SLEEP IT'S IRONIC HE COULD SAVE OTHERS FROM DEATH BUT NOT HIMSELF
TSH IT'D BE QUI GON HE UNDERSTOOD THE FORCE IN A WAY THAT EVEN YODA DIDN'T AND ALSO WASN'T AS RIDICULOUSLY STRICT AS THE OTHER JEDI SO THERE WOULD BE ROOM FOR EXPERIMENTING WITH THE FORCE
OBI WAN CAUSE HE'S A FREAKING BALLER OR TO INDULGE MY CHILDHOOD MAUL CAUSE I ALWAYS PLAYED THAT I WAS HIM TAKING OVER THE GALAXY AND EXTERMINATING THE JEDI
OR ANAKIN BECAUSE THEY'D LET GET AWAY WITH SHIT AND HAVE FUN ONCE IN A WHILE PLUS WOULD MAKE ME MORE OPEN MINDED AND ANAKIN WAS A WAR HERO CAN'T GO WRONG WITH EITHER OF THOSE JUST GOTTA MAKE SURE I DON'T RUN INTO ANAKIN AFTER THE CLONE WARS ARE OVER
COUNT DOOK BECAUSE HE VALUED POLITENESS AND CIVILITY BUT ALSO UNDERSTOOD THE WAYS OF POWER AND RUTHLESSNESS

ALTERNATIVELY MACE HINDU BECAUSE HE WAS A MORE AGGRESSIVE JEDI AND UNDERSTOOD THE VALUE OF A DIRECT APPROACH
KIT FASTO HE'S JUST AN EASYGOING LIKABLE GUY BUT HE IS ALSO SKILLED WITH THE FORCE AND A LIGHTSABER PLUS HE'S TRAINED A FEW APPRENTICES ALREADY IN LEGENDS AT LEAST
DARTH BANE BUFF SAID
DARTH BEVAN FOR SURE HE WAS A MASTER OF BOTH SIDES OF THE FORCE NOT JUST THE NARROW DOGMATIC VIEW OF THE JEDI
KYLE KATAR THE HAN SOLO OF CEDIS BUFF SAID
ANAKIN SKYWALKER HE DARES TO TAKE RISKS AND BREAK SOME RULES
EITHER YODA OR

YODA BECAUSE HE'S SO KNOWLEDGEABLE AND WISE AND HAS TRAINED HUNDREDS OF JEDI

BECAUSE HE'S A GREAT TEACHER AND SO FUNNY
SUPREME LEADER SNOKE
OBI WAN HE'S A BALLER
I HAVE FAITH IN LUKE SKYWALKER TO BECOME A GREAT MASTER LET'S GO WITH HIM
PROBABLY DARTH BEVAN HIS USE OF BOTH SIDES OF THE FORCE WOULD BE DOPE AND HE'S STRONG AS FUCK OTHERWISE I WOULD PROBABLY WANT DARTH ANNEDU OR WHATEVER HIS ABILITY TO LIVE FOREVER IS
KANAN BARRUS JEDI KNIGHT AFTER HIS ENCOUNTER WITH MAUL FORMEL DARTH NOW JUST MAUL
I HAVE FAITH IN LUKE SKYWALKER TO BECOME A GREAT MASTER LET'S GO WITH HIM
HAVE YOU NOT READ CATALYST


READ CATALYST
IMO THIS IS WHY EWAN MCGREGOR WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS ABOUT THE PREQUEL TRILOGY HE REALLY NAILED THE ROLE IN FUTURE FILMS IF THERE IS A VISION LIKE REY HAD IN FFA THAT CONTAINS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM MAKE AN APPEARANCE IN THAT
HERE'S HOPING EWAN GETS TAPPED FOR AN ANTHOLOGY FILM
EWAN DID A GREAT JOB OF STUDYING ALEC
YOU CAN TELL HE STUDIED AND PRACTICED FOR HIS ROLE OUTSIDE OF JUST MEMORIZING THE SCRIPTURE PROBABLY WHY HE WAS EASILY THE BEST ACTOR IN THE PREQUEL TRILOGY
PLEASE MAKE AN OBI WAN MOVIE WITH EWAN PLEASSSSSE
MOST DEFINITELY LOVE THIS VIDEO
IN THE INTEREST OF MAINTAINING QUALITY ENTHUSIASM I'D SAY A SOLO MOVIE WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO A TRILOGY

THAT SAID IF THEY DO TWO FLICKS I'VE GOT THE TITLES
KENOBI
2 BEN KENOBI
I THINK HE WAS AWESOME AND DESERVES A MOVIE BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE THE MANNERISMS BEING SPOT ON
EWAN MCGREGOR IS A TRIBUTE TO OUR GENERATION YA NAILED IT BUD
I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS VIDEO MADE ME AS EMOTIONAL AS IT DID EWAN DID AN AMAZING JOB AND IS IMO A VERY UNDERRATED PART OF THE PREQUEL OBI WAN KENOBI WAS AWESOME
THIS IS THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY OF THE PREQUEL REALLY A PERFECT BIT OF CASTING AND A FANTASTIC ACTOR ALMOST ENTIRELY WASTED
I ALWAYS LIKED HIS PORTRAYAL NOW I KNOW WHY
YEA NO SHIT HE'S DOING A LITTLE THING CALLED ACTING I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF IT
A LOT OF YOU WON'T LIKE ME SAYING THIS BUT I SEEM TO BE ONE OF FEW PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T ACTUALLY LIKE HIS ACTING I RECENTLY ROTS AND APART FROM THE FINAL SCENES WHERE HE IS FIGHTING ANAKIN HIS ACTING SEEMS VERY WOODEN I KNOW HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO ACT IN FRONT OF BLUE SCREENS AND FAKE DROIDS ALIENS ETC BUT I'VE SEEN OTHER ACTORS DO A BETTER JOB
WOW AMAZING WORK HAVE YOU MADE AN ANAKIN ONE
IS THIS THE ONE ON ULTIMAKER DESIGNED BY JACKY WAN PRINTED ONE OF THESE MYSELF A WHILE AGO AND LOVED HOW WELL IT IS DESIGNED LINK HERE FOR THOSE WHO ARE CURIOUS
EN BLOG
HEAVY LASER CANNAS
THERE IS A CHILDHOOD NOSTALGIA IN ME THAT GETS WEAK AT THE KNEES SEEING THINGS LIKE THIS IN FOIL I THINK IT WAS ALL THE STICKER BOOKS I HAD AS A YOUNG TEENAGER
WISH I HAD SOMETHING INSIGHTFUL TO SAY BUT I JUST THINK THIS LOOKS DOPE
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS IT'S REALLY COOL
UGH THESE 2 DROIDS ARE MORE COMPETENT THAN THE ENTIRE EMPIRE ON REBELS EVEN THRAWN I LIKE REBELS BUT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ZERO SENSE OF DANGER ON THAT SHOW
IF THE DROID ARMY HAD BEEN MADE OF THE EXCLUSIVELY I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THEY WOULD HAVE WON THE WAR EASILY
ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENES ON THE CLONE WARS WAS THE LAST STAND ON RYLOTH WHEN THE CLONES AND THEIR JEDI GENERAL CAN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME GET GUNNED DOWN
NOT BECAUSE I LIKE THE SEPARATISTS OR ANYTHING BUT BECAUSE IT SHOWED THAT THEY ARE FIGHTING A WAR BOTH SIDES TAKE LOSSES AND ANYONE CAN DIE
WHICH EPISODE IS THIS FROM
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE SHORT FOR A FIRST ORDER STORM-TROOPER

PAGE SOUTH SO COOL
HE LOOKS LIKE A LEGO MAN
THAT SECOND PICTURE LOOKS STRAIGHT THUG HALACHA
HERE'S PROBABLY HOW THEY MADE IT
FIRST PICTURE LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A SITCOM
I WAS EXCITED TOO
IT HELPS THAT OF THE GALAXY WASN'T THERE WHEN IT WENT DOWN THAT'S LIKE THE IF THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND ONE OF THE JOINT CHIEFS TRIED TO KILL ME IN A FOILED COUP BUT LUCKILY I WAS SAVED BY MY SECRET SERVICE AGENTS WHEN IN REALITY THE PRESIDENT HAD THEM KILLED THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WOULD BELIEVE WHAT WAS BEING SAID BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T COMPREHEND A LARGER COUP AT HAND NOW IMAGINE THAT BUT INSTEAD OF AMERICA AND MILLION PEOPLE IT'S A GALAXY WITH TRILLIONS PALATINE WAS THE SUPREME CHANCELLOR AND MOST PEOPLE LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID HE DOESN'T LOOK SO DANGEROUS IF I TOLD YOU AN OLD YEAR OLD JUMPED AROUND AND KILLED MASTERS IN UNDER TEN MINUTES YOU'D HAVE LAUGHED IN MY FACE AND SENT ME HOME
HE HAD GUARDS AND STORM TROOPERS AND THAT FURTHER SULLIES THEIR FORCE POWERS AS CHARLATANS
HIS PERSONAL SECRET GUARD DARTH VADER INTERVENED AT THE LAST MINUTE
HE EXPLAINED ALL THE DEAD JEDI BY SAYING THEY WERE SHOT BY CLONES AT HIS ORDER BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO KILL HIM AND USURP THE REPUBLIC HE EXPLAINS SURVIVING PRESUMABLY BY SAYING DARTH VADER TURNED ON THE EVIL JEDI AND SAVED HIM
MACE HINDU WAS SECOND TO YODA IN AUTHORITY IT WOULD BE ASSUMED THAT WHATEVER HINDU DID HE ALSO INSTRUCTED OTHER JEDI TO DO THE SAME BESIDES AT THE END OF THE CLONE WARS THE JEDI HAD A HORRIBLE PUBLIC IMAGE AND PALATINE WAS VIEWED AS A BENEVOLENT LEADER
ANAKIN SAVED HIM
IN A GALAXY OF TRILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND COUNTLESS PLANETS DO YOU THINK THE AVERAGE JOE IS GONNA KNOW CARE ABOUT WHATS HAPPENING TO THE CHANCELLOR BILLIONS OF MILES AWAY I DONT THINK SO TSH ONLY THE WEALTHY AND THOSE ON CORUSCANT WOULD REALLY CARE IMHO ANYWAY LIKE I CANT IMAGINE SOMEBODY LIKE OWEN LARS GIVING A FUCK ABOUT THE SENATE AND STUFF
SINCE HIS KIDNAP BY SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE DROID ARMY GENERAL GRIEVOUS HE HAS TAKEN EXTRA SECURITY MEASURES AND HIRED A FORMER JEDI DARTH VADER AS HIS PERSONAL BODYGUARD

HE KILLED THE FOUR JEDI MASTERS AND TRIED TO SAVE ANAKIN SKYWALKER WHO ALSO DIED
HOW TO ELI SCRIBBLE ON TOP OF BACKGROUND PHOTO QUICK MESSY TRACE OF CHARACTER PERFECT
THIS ONE'S PRETTY GOOD I LIKE HIS COMPOSITION
WOW I REALLY LIKE THIS
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD NOT MY FAVORITE STYLE BUT CERTAINLY INTERESTING AND WAY BETTER THAN ANYTHING I COULD EVER DO
I WONDER HOW MUCH OF THAT MONEY WILL COME FROM PEOPLE THINKING THIS MOVIE IS CONTINUING THE STORY OF FINN REY AND KALO
YEAH THAT'S NICE AND ALL BUT HOW WILL YOU TRULY KNOW HOW MUCH IT MAKES IF I DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T SELL TICKETS YET

DISNEY YOU LOVE MONEY RELEASE THE KRAKEN TICKETS
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE WHEN TICKETS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR SALE YET
FOR EVERYBODY IN THE US WAITING FOR THE TICKETS TO GO ON SALE THEY ARE GONNA BE AVAILABLE MONDAY

SOURCE AM AN AMC EMPLOYEE AND WE RECEIVED AN EMAIL ABOUT IT YESTERDAY NIGHT
IF THE ANNOYING SWEENS THAT WERE TALKING ALL THE WAY THROUGH FFA COMPARING IT TO HARRY POTTER ARE ANYTHING TO GO BY MAN I WAS GRINDING MY TEETH THROUGH THAT SCREENING
I'M NOT SURPRISED STAR WARS FANS WILL COME OUT IN FULL FORCE
YEAH FIRST THEY'LL ACTUALLY HAVE TO PUT TICKETS ON SALE AHEM TAPS FOOT
THOSE DEATH TROOPERS LOOK AWESOME
HOW CAN IT BE ON PACE SALES WISE IF IT HASN'T RELEASED YET
ANYBODY NOTICE THAT THE TROOPER IN THIS PICTURE IS HOLDING A STORM-TROOPER DOLL
I DON'T BELIEVE THESE NUMBERS IT'S LIKE WEEKS UNTIL THE MOVIE AND WE STILL CAN'T PREORDER TICKETS THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS
IN YOUR FUCKING FACE DISNEY

WOW NICE WHICH IS YOUR FAVORITE
IMPRESSIVE MOST IMPRESSIVE
AMAZING
NO FENDIG
WOW FANTASTIC COLLECTION HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE YOU READ
VERY IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN COLLECTING THESE
WOW FIRST OFF REALLY JEALOUS SECOND JUST CURIOUS HOW MUCH OF THOSE BOOKS ARE STILL CANON RIGHT NOW
WOW AMAZING
CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG BUT I THINK YOU ARE MISSING THE DARK FORCES BOOKS THE KYLE KATAR STORIES I THINK THEY SHOULD BE A PART OF THIS COLLECTION
I NEVER SEE THEM MENTIONED AROUND HERE BUT I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND RUN MOVING TARGET AND THE WEAPON OF THE JEDI THEY'RE SHORTER BUT THE STORIES ARE FUN AND THEY'RE REALLY NOT WRITTEN ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN MOST OTHER CANON NOVELS RUN EVEN HAS ONE OF THE BEST IMPERIAL CHARACTERS WITH ALECIA BECK
HOW LOST STARS HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED YET IS BEYOND ME IT IS A YOUNG ADULT NOVEL AND IT NECESSITATES A READ IT IS A GREAT BOOK AND I'VE READ NOTHING BUT PRAISE ABOUT IT
AS IMPORTANT AS THE BIG NOVELS JUST SHORTER

I WOULD CONSIDER WEAPON OF A JEDI AS IMPORTANT TO JEDI TRAINING AS HEIR TO THE JEDI IF YOU'VE READ TWILIGHT COMPANY MOVING TARGET FOLLOWS IT UP WELL AND CONNECTED IT TO ROTC RUN IS FUN IF YOU LIKE HAN AND CHEWIE

THERE ARE ALSO OF THEM ABOUT CHARACTERS FROM REBELS ABOUT ZARE LEONIS IMPERIAL ACADEMY CADET FROM SEASON BEFORE DURING AND AFTER SEASON AND ONE ABOUT EZRA AND BOSK BEFORE SEASON
THIS SITE HELPED ME A LOT WHEN IT CAME TO KEEPING TRACK OF CANON RECENTLY NEVER READ JUNIOR NOVELS BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THEM


I ENJOYED ARC IN BEFORE THE AWAKENING I RECOMMEND CHECKING THAT OUT
HE LOOKS ANGRY
IT WASN'T INTENDED TO HINT AT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SO BY DEFINITION IT'S NOT FORESHADOWING IT'S A CAUTIONARY SIGN TO LUKE

I AM GUESSING PEOPLE WHO THINK IT'S FORESHADOWING ARE INTERPRETING HIS HEAD IN THE HELMET TO MEAN THAT HE WILL BECOME VADER AND THAT IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE HE'S HIS SON BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE AND IT NEVER HAPPENED SO IT STILL ISN'T FORESHADOWING
THEY'VE ALSO GOT THE YEAR THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK WAS RELEASED AS
ENTIRE ARC IN ESB IS ABOUT HOW HE IS MAKING THE MISTAKES THAT LEAD ONE DOWN THE PATH TO THE DARK SIDE HE LETS HIMSELF BE RULED BY EMOTION HE ACTS WITHOUT CLEAR THOUGHT ON THE CONSEQUENCES HE IS IN A RUSH TO GET POWER TO SAVE HIS FRIENDS AND HE DISOBEYS BOTH HIS TEACHERS TO CONFRONT A DARK LORD OF THE SITH WITHOUT COMPLETING HIS TRAINING THE MOVIE EVEN ENDS WITH HIM GETTING A CYBERNETIC REPLACEMENT HAND BECOMING MORE MACHINE THE SAME WAY ANAKIN DID

AND THAT'S WHY IT'S FORESHADOWING THE SCENE IN THE CAVE LUKE IS FOLLOWING THE PATH TO THE DARK SIDE LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM AND YODA THE FORCE ITSELF ARE WARNING HIM AGAINST IT BY SHOWING WHAT HE COULD BECOME A LESS THAN HUMAN SERVANT OF THE EMPEROR WHY WOULD LUKE SEE HIMSELF IN VADER BECAUSE VADER IS HIS FATHER AND LUKE IS MAKING THE SAME TYPE OF MISTAKE THAT LEAD VADER TO BECOME VADER IN THE FIRST PLACE


IT'S THE FORCE GIVING HIM A SPEED BUMP TELLING HIM TO SLOW DOWN AMD WATCH WHAT HE'S DOING BEFORE HE BECOMES LIKE HIS DADDY
IT'S DEFINITELY FORESHADOWING IT COMPLICATES THE LUKE SKYWALKER PRESENTED TO US BY A NEW HOPE I EAST THE UPBEAT REBEL FARMBOY WITH HEART OF GOLD WHO SAVES THE GALAXY IT SHOWS THAT THE DARK SIDE IS IN LUKE AS WELL AND HINTS TOWARDS CONNECTION WITH LUKE
IT'S NOT FORESHADOWING ANYTHING IT SHOWS LUKE BEATING HIS INNER ENEMY
DUDE NO ONE REALLY KNOWS FOR SURE WHAT THAT SCENE WAS
THIS IS A COMMENT SECTION ISN'T IT I COMMENT
I REBEL
AMAZING TALENT EVERYTHING IS JUST PERFECT
DAMN THAT'S EPIC I LOVE THE EYES
VERY NICE AND THANKS FOR SPELLING ROGUE CORRECTLY
THAT'S REALLY GOOD
ASTONISHING AS A FELLOW DRAWER I LOVE SEEING THESE TYPE OF POSTS
GOOD FREAKING JOB
BRAAAAAAAINSSSS
I RABAL




WOW AMAZING
WELL WAS HALF WAY THROUGH CATALYST NOW I KNOW WHO AYN IS THANKS
I HOPE SO COMMANDER FOR YOUR SAKE

THE EMPEROR IS NOT AS FORGIVING AS I AM
THIS IS FOR USA
IS THERE A STANDARDISED TIME FOR TICKET SALES ALL OVER AMERICA HERE IN IRELAND MY LOCAL CINEMA STARTED SELLING YESTERDAY
I HAVE HEARD FROM A SIMILAR SOURCE THAT THE IS THE DAY FOR MY LOCAL CINEMA IN AUSTRALIA
ARE YOU ABLE TO TELL IF THERE WILL BE THURSDAY NIGHT SHOWINGS




I BOUGHT MY TICKETS ON THE SURPRISED THAT THE US PUTS THEM ON SALE LATER
ARE THOSE CHEAP TICKET PRICES TO ANYONE ELSE IT COSTS AT MY THEATER FOR ANY ADULT TICKET FOR 2D
ACCORDING TO MY LOCAL THEATER THEY'RE GOING ON SALE TOMORROW FRIDAY NOVEMBER I WONDER IF IT'S UP TO THE THEATER CHAIN
WHAT TIME ZONE ARE YOU IN AND IS THIS MEANING MINUTE AFTER SUNDAY NIGHT
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WATCHED ALL THE STAR WARS
WHAT PART THE SEX WITH YOUR SISTER OR BEARING A CHILD BY A EKWOK
AH YOU'VE FOUND LUKE BANNISTER
MY LORD IS THAT LEGAL
FUNNY EVERY WEEK
I HAVE VADER AND LEIA AS THE PARENTS AND THEN TWO LITTLE ELIAS AND A LUKE AS THE KIDS NOT SURE IF THAT IS WORSE OR BETTER
LEIA IS A TIME TRAVELER WHO SOMEHOW ADOPTED HERSELF AND HER BROTHER WHO ALTHOUGH ARE TWINS HAPPEN TO BE A COUPLE YEARS APART AND THEY ADOPTED WICKET

WELL IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO IN A GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY I'D CHALK THIS UP TO THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY
IT'S NOT LEGAL TO HAVE A PET WHERE YOU LIVE I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE DRIVING AT HERE
THAT ISN'T AN EKWOK THAT'S FINN THE HUMAN
THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ONGOING MYSTERY DATING BACK TO EVEN AFTER SOME GOOGLING IT SEEMS LIKE NO ONE KNOWS WHO PLAYED HERALDRY
OF ALL THE MYSTERIES THAT HAVE POPPED UP ON HERE THIS ONE ACTUALLY HAS SOME REAL INVESTIGATION THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HAVE YOU TRIED REACHING OUT TO THE PEOPLE AT LUCASFILM I HAVE NO IDEA IF HE WOULD KNOW BUT PABLO HIDALGO IS PRETTY ACCESSIBLE ON TWITTER SO HE MIGHT BE A GOOD PLACE TO START IF HE DOESN'T KNOW MAYBE HE CAN POINT YOU TO SOMEONE WHO MIGHT
I REMEMBER READING SOMEWHERE THAT SHE WAS SOMEHOW RELATED TO SOMEONE WORKING ON THE FILM THROUGH MARRIAGE OR SOMETHING AND GOT A CAMEO PART AND THAT SHE WORKED
AS A MODEL IN LIKE AUSTRALIA BUT NEVER ACTED

NO IDEA HOW TRUE THAT IS BUT IT WAS ON FORUMS A DECADE OR SO AGO
LOST AN ACTOR MASTER OOLASBF HAS HOW EMBARRASSING
THERE'S A TON OF UNIDENTIFIED EXTRAS IN THE STAR WARS MOVIES THE ONLY REASON ANYONE CARES ABOUT KIYI MANTEEL IN PARTICULAR IS BECAUSE SHE HAS A BIG OLD PAIR OF DEATH STARS HANGING OFF HER CHEST ADMIT IT
RIP LT TRIDUAM YOU GAVE ME MY UNDERNAME
THE STAR WARS MINUTE GUYS ARE GOING TO BE SO SAD
THE STORM-TROOPER WHO BONKED HIS HEAD ON THE LOWERED DOOR IN EP PASSED AWAY RECENTLY TOO
AWIWI
AT HIS POST TO THE VERY END RIP
WHEN I WAS MAKING MY ACCOUNT I WAS THINKING OF THE NAME I USED OR ANOTHER PUN BASED ON TK I'LL GIVE YOU A COOKIE IF YOU CAN GUESS WHAT IT IS

THIS IS A BUMMER MOST MAJOR
NEWS
I FEEL LIKE THAT THE SHOT OF THE SHIP IS FROM ANOTHER FAN FILM WITH A DIFFERENT COLORATION ON THE PLANET I'M PRETTY SURE I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE COULD JUST BE IMAGINING THINGS
I'M PLAYING KOROR RIGHT NOW MY CHARACTER IS MALE SO AM I BUT YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO BE A FEMALE IN THE GAME I'VE ALREADY FOUND OUT THAT YOU ARE DARTH BEVAN SO WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THAT IS HE A MALE OR FEMALE
I CALLED THE THEATER AND ASKED THEM KNOWING THAT I WAS HOLDING TEN TICKETS IN MY HAND IF ROGUE ONE TICKETS WERE AVAILABLE THEY SAID NUMBER I THEN LAID MY CARDS TICKETS ON THE TABLE AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD GET A MANAGER THE MANAGER COMES ON THE PHONE AND SAYS THAT I MUST HAVE WALKED UP AND ASKED AND BOUGHT THE TICKETS DURING A FIVE MINUTE WINDOW BETWEEN WHEN THE DATES TIMES PRICES WERE ADDED TO THE SOFTWARE BUT BEFORE THEY LOCKED THEM OUT OF BEING SOLD I AM PERSONALLY PRETTY SURE THAT THE FIVE MINUTES WAS BROLLY MUCH LONGER BUT ANY HALF COMPETENT SUPERVISOR AT BEING PRESENTED WITH PROOF THAT SUCH A SITUATION EXISTED WITH LITTLE TO NO WAY TO PROVE HOW LONG IT LASTED WOULD HAVE CALLED IT FIVE MINUTES LONG NO MATTER HOW LONG AGO THE DATA WAS ENTERED AND WAS BROLLY MAKING SURE TO LOCK IT OUT OF BEING SOLD WHILE ON THE PHONE WITH ME ANYWAY HE DID SAY THAT THE TICKETS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR PRESALE NEXT WEEK BUT WHEN I ASKED PRECISELY WHEN HE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE A DEFINITE ANSWER OH WELL APOLOGIES TO ALL


TL R I THOUGHT I MADE THE DISCOVERY FOR A LARGE CHUNK OF THE COMMUNITY TO GET SOME KIND OF HEAD START BUT COME TO FIND OUT I JUST HAPPENED TO ASK BEFORE IT WAS LOCKED OUT OF BEING SOLD BUT AFTER THE DATA HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM
YEAH I THINK EVERYONE ALREADY REALIZED IT WAS A FLUKE
I'VE NEVER HEARD IT CALLED A FAN THEORY IT'S ACTUALLY STATED IN THE FILM
IT'S PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T ACTUALLY RECENTLY WATCHED ANH WHO ARE PERPETUATING THIS MYTHOLOGY DISREGARD THESE LIES AS REBEL PROPAGANDA AND NOTHING MORE
I FIND IT QUITE ANNOYING HOW PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK STORM-TROOPER ACTUALLY CAN'T HIT ANYTHING

PEOPLE SAY THAT BECAUSE DESPITE THE TINY SCENES THAT SAY OTHERWISE ABOUT STORM TROOPERS LETTING THEM GO TOO PRECISE FOR SAND PEOPLE ETC THERE'S MOVIES IN WHICH THEY PROCEED TO NOT HIT ANYTHING
WELL I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE SCENE UP UNTIL A CERTAIN POINT I THINK THE STORM-TROOPER WERE SHOOTING TO KILL THERE WAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE INVADERS UNTIL THEY REVEALED THEMSELVES WHILE RESCUING LEIA FROM HER CELL I THINK ONCE THEY WERE IN THE TRASH COMPACTOR WORD MUST HAVE GOTTEN OUT THAT THERE WERE REBELS TRYING TO HELP THE PRINCESS ESCAPE AT THAT POINT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT VADER LARKIN HASHED UP THEIR LITTLE PLAN TO LET THEM ESCAPE HOWEVER IN THE SAME SCENE THAT VADER TELLS LARKIN ABOUT PRESENCE LARKIN GETS NOTIFIED OF THE PRINCESS'S ESCAPE FROM HER CELL VADER SAYS ESCAPE IS NOT HIS PLAN AND STORMS OUT OF THE ROOM SO WHO REALLY KNOWS WHEN THEY DECIDED TO LET THEM ESCAPE
PROBABLY BECAUSE VERY FEW PEOPLE REMEMBER THE SMALL SECOND SCENES WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT THE TRACKER AND HOW EASY THE ESCAPE WAS THOSE SCENES ARE JUST FOLLOWING THE FIRST EVER LIGHT SABER DUEL AND THE DEATH OF BEN SO I DOUBT PEOPLE FOCUS ON THE DIALOG AFTER THAT JUST MY FAN THEORY ABOUT A FAN THEORY
EXCUSE MY MASSIVE TYPOS INCOMING WORKING WITH A BROKEN KEYBOARD

A LITTLE DISCREPANCY WITH THE FILM VS THE FANS WHEN IT COMES TO THE THEORY MANY TIMES IT'S USED TO EXPLAIN WHY THE STORM-TROOPER MISS WHEN STATED AS BEING ACCURATE EARLIER IN THE FILM BLASTPOINTS TOO PRECISE ETC THIS I SIMPLY DON'T BELIEVE AT ALL

HOWEVER IT'S ALSO PAINFULLY OBVIOUS THAT THEY WERE BEING ALLOWED TO ESCAPE ONCE THEY BEAV THE HANGAR BEAUS NO TURRETS SHOOT AT THEM AND ONLY FIGHTERS GIVE CHASE

SO A TIMBLIN OF EVENTS AND PLANS

LEIA ORDER TO BE EXECUTED BECAUSE SHE WON'T GIVE IN TO TORTURE AND REVAL THE HIDDEN BASE
2 OUR HEROES ARRIVE
THEIR RESCUE ATTEMPT IS FOUND OUT ORDERS COME IN TO KILL THEM CAPTURE IF POSSIBLE MOST LIKELY MORE PRISONERS ALWAYS GOOD FOR INFORMATION
A TRACKING BEACON IS PUT ON THE FALCON FOR SOME REASON POSSIBLY AFTER THY LOST THEM IN TH TRASH COMPACTOR AND THOUGHT THEY MIGHT ESCAPE OR THY PLANNED TO LAUNCH IT ADRIFT AND SEE WHO WOULD PICK IT UP PLAN FOR EVERYTHING AND YOU CAN NEVER FAIL
EVERYONE GETS TO THE SHIP TO ESCAPE VADER ORDERS LARKIN NOT TO SHOOT IT WITH TURBOLASERS AND ONLY SEND FIGHTERS OUT TO STRAFE IT MAYBE SEE IF THEY'LL SURRENDER BUT HE DOUBTS THEY WILL AT THIS POINT I'M TAKING AN AWFUL RISK VADER
TRACKING BEACON PLAN WORKS IT WAS EITHER TRY THAT OUT OR BLOW THEM UP AND LOSE THEIR CHANCE AT FIGHTING THE REBEL BASE
IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE OF ROTC ADAMIK THERE ISN'T A GOOD REASON THAT THEY ARE BEATEN SO EASILY BY A BUNCH OF TEDDY BEARS
BECAUSE THESE FANS DON'T KNOW THE MOVIE AS WELL AS THEY THINK THEY DO IT'S LIKE SAYING WAS MASTER IS A FAN THEORY
ITS NOT STATED ITS ALLUDED TO BY OTHER EVIDENCE

MEANWHILE LUKE HAS PUT ON A STORM-TROOPER HELMET AND COMMENTED HOW HE CANT SEE ANYTHING WITH IT ON

SO BOTH POSSIBILITIES ARE VIABLE
BECAUSE THESE FANS HADNT REALLY WATCHED THE MOVIE
THE EKWOK COMMENTS IN THIS THREAD ARE PURE GOLD SAVAGE BRUTAL VICIOUS

WHO KNEW THAT THESE HILARIOUS LITTLE COMIC RELIEF TEDDY BEARS WHO BOUNCE ROCKS OFF STORM-TROOPER AND DO FUNNY PRATFALLS WERE ACTUALLY THE EQUIVALENT TO THE XENOMORPHA FROM ALIEN

ETA STAR WARS VERSION OF VIETNAM MY SIDES
THE FAN PART OF THE THEORY IS THAT THEY WERE LETTING THE HEROES GO INTENTIONALLY MISSING THEM IN ALL OF THE MOVIES NOT JUST IN ANH
THAT VOICE OVER WORK STILL GETS ME IT'S SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF SOUTH PARK
I LOVE HOW IT'S ALL FOCUSED ON THE DROID
REMEMBER THEIR CHARGE AGAINST THE LUNGANS IN EPISODE I THEY SEEM MORE THAN CAPABLE OF IT
IN EPISODE I WHEN THEY MENACINGLY LOL PUN MARCHED TOWARD THE LUNGANS THEY FIRED FAST AS CRAP
ACCORDING TO THE BOOK ULTIMATE STAR WARS THE E BLASTER HAS A TRIGGER AS WELL AS A SINGLE-FIRE ONE
I THINK IT'S PART OF THE CHARGE PROGRAM IT WOULD HELP BREAK A DEFENCE LINE OR FORMATION
SEEMS TO ME THE FIRE RATES CHANGED FROM EPISODE TO EPISODE IN THE CLONE WARS SOMETIMES THEY WERE SUBMACHINE GUNS SOMETIMES THEY WERE LIKE GARAND FIRE RATE THAT EPISODE WAS DEFINITELY A FULL AUTO BLASTERS EPISODE
WELL DROIDS WOULD HAVE SUPER FAST REFLEXES SINCE THEY'RE SO SKINNY IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO COMPENSATE BY BEING FAST SHOTS
I DON'T KNOW THE FLASHBACK SCENE FROM THE ORIGINAL TERMINATOR THOSE BIGS SONS OF BITCHES WERE FIRING AWAY
SHOT KYLE REECE UP SOMETHING PRETTY GOOD
PROBABLY ILLEGAL BUT THE EMPIRE IS MORE THAN WILLING TO BEND THE RULES WHEN IT SUITS THEIR INTEREST

ALSO IN ESB IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN WHEN THEY ARE REALLY IN NEED OF BOUNTY HUNTERS THEY STILL DON'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH
I WOULD THINK BOUNTY HUNTING AT ITS CORE WOULD BE LEGAL A BOUNTY HUNTER IS SIMPLY A PERSON WHO CAPTURES CRIMINALS FUGITIVES WANTED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR PAYMENT THEY'RE CONTRACTORS YES THERE ARE SOME WHO WORK FOR CRIMINALS THEMSELVES LIKE ABBA BUT I WOULD THINK SOME WOULD ONLY TAKE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
I'VE NEVER READ ANY SOURCE CLAIMING THAT THEIR DUTY IS ILLEGAL IN MANY CASES IT SEEMS TO BE AN HONORABLE OR RESPECTABLE PROFESSION THEY SEEM TO BE SOMETHING LIKE PRIVATE POLICE OF THE GALAXY THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY LIKED BUT THEIR DUTIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT THEY BRING IN CRIMINALS

WHO'S A CRIMINAL IS WHERE THE LINE GETS BLURRY IT SEEMS TO DEPEND ON WHAT LAWS THE ONE WHO HIRES THE BOUNTY HUNTER NEEDS TO FOLLOW TO THE EMPIRE JEDI NEED TO BE BROUGHT IN TO THE HUTT CARTEL SOLO NEEDS TO BE ARRESTED

TO GIVE A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE LET'S IMAGINE A BOUNTY HUNTER WHO SOMEHOW CAPTURES OSAMA BIN LADEN IN PRE AFGHANISTAN UNDER TALIBAN LAW OSAMA WAS NOT A TERRORIST BUT AN IDOLATRY CLAIMING OR FILING A BOUNTY ON HIM IS IN THEIR LAWS A CRIME THE WEST HOWEVER WOULD LEGALLY RESPECT THE RIGHT TO HUNT SUCH A CRIMINAL WHILE THE BOUNTY HUNTER MAY BE BREAKING AN AFGHAN LAW HE OR SHE WOULD BE COMPENSATED WELL IF OSAMA WAS CAPTURED IN THE WESTERN

SO THERE YOU HAVE IT THE FILER OF THE CONTRACT FOLLOWS LAWS THAT PERHAPS THE HUNTED DOES NOT THE BOUNTY REPUTATION AS A RESIDENT OF THE UNDERWORLD IS MERELY A PRODUCT OF NEEDING TO BEING IN SOME OF ITS RESIDENTS

TL R LEGALITY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER
ONE THING THAT'S ALWAYS ANNOYED ME IS THAT BOUNTY HUNTERS ARE TREATED LIKE MARCS WHEN THEY AREN'T ESPECIALLY IN ACW
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BOUNTY HUNTERS IN STAR WARS WE REALLY ARE PUTTING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF TWO OR THREE JOBS TOGETHER AND CALLING IT THE WRONG THING BOUNTY HUNTERS TRACK DOWN PEOPLE USUALLY FUGITIVES AND RING THEM BACK FOR MONEY WHAT WE OFTEN SEE BOUNTY HUNTERS DO IN STAR WARS IS ACT AS ASSASSINS AND MERCENARIES THEY KILL PEOPLE FOR MONEY OR ACT AS SOLDIERS FOR HIRE SO IF WE ARE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT BOUNTY HUNTING THEN YES IT'S PROBABLY LEGAL IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ASSASSINS PROBABLY NOT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MERCENARIES MAYBE MAYBE NOT IT DEPENDS ON WHO THEY ARE WORKING FOR AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING
IT PROBABLY COMPLETELY DEPENDS ON WHO IS HIRING THEM IF THE EMPIRE IS HIRING THEM THEN ITS IS LEGAL AND FINE IF ITS WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS HIRED BY AN OUTSIDE PARTY AND IS GOING AGAINST THE INTEREST OF THE RULING GOVERNMENT EMPIRE OR THE REPUBLIC THEN I'M SURE THEY WOULD NOT BE OKAY WITH IT AND THEY WOULD TAKE THE BOUNTY HUNTER DOWN
THE PROFESSION IS LEGAL GOVERNMENT BOUNTIES WOULD BE LEGAL BUT PERSONAL BOUNTIES WOULD BE ILLEGAL SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE WILD WEST OF THE US A BOUNTY HUNTER WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A US MARSHALL NOW WE'RE GIVEN A LIST OF CRIMINALS AND OTHER PEOPLE THE US WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE IN STAR WARS THE SAME APPLIES THE REPUBLIC OR EMPIRE OR SOME PLANETARY GOVERNMENT WOULD OFFER A BOUNTY ON SOME CRIMINAL

IF IT'S A PERSONAL BOUNTY LIKE 2 GUYS PLAYING HABACUC AND ONE CHEATS THEN THE OTHER GUY PLACES A BOUNTY ON THE CHEATER WOULD BE ILLEGAL IT WASN'T AN OFFICIAL AND LEGAL GOVERNMENT BOUNTY AND THE GUY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL SO A BOUNTY HUNTER KILLING A GUY FOR SOMETHING PERSONAL LIKE THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL
IMPERIAL MARCH CONFIRMED NICE
SO THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF OPENING FANFARE AT THE START OF THE MOVIE I'M GUESSING WE'LL GET A LONG TIME AGO FOLLOWED BY AN UPDATED STAR WARS LOGO AKIN TO THE NEW MARVEL STUDIOS OPENING LOGO THAT THEN FADES TO BLACK

THEN THE MOVIE PROPER STARTS THE TITLE ROGUE ONE IS ONLY SHOWN AT THE VERY END CUT TO CREDITS
FOUR AND A HALF WEEKS TO WRITE IT THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH TIME
THAT BEING SAID I'M UNBELIEVABLY HYPED FOR THIS SCORE AND HAVE COMPLETE FAITH IN GIACCHINO HE'S AN AMAZING COMPOSER WHO KNOWS THE ORIGINAL SCORES INSIDE OUT BUT ISN'T AFRAID TO DO HIS OWN STYLE IN THE ARTICLE HE SAYS ABOUT ORIGINAL SCORE CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT
AS LONG AS OUR EMPIRE'S MARCH IS INCLUDED
I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS INTERVIEW VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SCORE SEEMS LIKE THEY PICKED THE PERFECT GUY FOR IT BASED OFF HIS PREVIOUS WORKS AND LOVE OF THE GENRE
THE FILM OPENS WITH A SLOW IMPERIAL MARCH AS WE ZOOM OUT TO SEE A DEAD EYE OF A REBEL SOLDIER AND WE NOTICE A RED LIGHT SHINING ON HIS FACE AND WE HEAR IN THE BREATHING OF DARTH VADER
THE JEDI AREN'T REALLY ABOUT HAVING OTHER SECTS FOR POWERFUL PRACTITIONERS OF THE FORCE THEY'RE A CENTRALISED RELIGION WITH A GRAND MASTER WHICH WAS LUKE SKYWALKER

THE CHURCH OF THE FORCE IS A SEPARATE RELIGIOUS ORDER IN THE LIGHT SIDE BUT DOES NOT PRACTICE THE FORCE TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE JEDI BECAUSE IF THEY FOUND SOMEONE POWERFUL ENOUGH THEY'D GIVE THEM TO THE JEDI
AS FAR AS WE KNOW NUMBER THEY'RE ALL DEAD AGAIN
NUMBER I'M PRETTY SURE KALO AND THE KNIGHTS OF REN KILLED ANY JEDI STUDENTS
WELL THAT PARTICULAR COMIC TAKES PLACE BETWEEN EPISODES IV AND VERB SO THERE WOULD BE NO ACTIVE SCHOOLS SINCE LUKE AND YODA ARE ALL THAT'S LEFT OF THE JEDI LUKE WON'T CREATE HIS SCHOOL UNTIL SOMETIME AFTER EPISODE VI AND WHILE WE DON'T KNOW THE EVENTS THAT LEAD TO IT'S DESTRUCTION WE CAN ASSUME THAT IT WAS THE ONLY JEDI SCHOOL IN EXISTENCE AND SINCE CANON DOESN'T YET EXTEND BEYOND THE EVENTS OF VII WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ELSE
THAT COMIC IS BARELY YEARS AFTER ORDER LUKE IS BARELY A JEDI IN IT

BUT TO ACTUALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION NUMBER WE REALLY DON'T KNOW THE MOVIES HAVEN'T TOUCHED ON STORY AND UNTIL THEY DO WE CAN'T EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE IN CANON TO TOUCH ON THAT STORY EITHER
I'D LOVE TO SEE THE FOUNDING OF ROGUE SQUADRON ALSO SEEMS LIKE A NATURAL FOLLOW UP
LOBO A STAR WARS STORY

OR MAYBE AN UNCAUGHT ADVENTURE
I WOULDN'T BE OPPOSED TO ONE FOCUSING ON THE IMPERIAL SIDE OF THINGS A LOOK INSIDE THE IMPERIAL MILITARY AFTER THE DEATH STAR'S DESTRUCTION MAYBE FOCUS ON A FEW POV IMPERIAL OFFICERS AND PILOTS AND STORM TROOPERS DDK I'M TIRED OF SEEING EVERYTHING FROM THE REBELS PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE BAD GUYS ARE THINKING AND MAYBE PROVE THAT NOT ALL IMPERIALS ARE BAD

OH I'D LOVE TO SEE ONE WHERE HAN AND CHEWIE RETURN TO HOME ON KASHYYYK AND WE GET TO MEET HIS FAMILY MAYBE THEY COULD GET SOME BIG-NAME ACTORS TO SHOW UP IN IT TOO MAYBE EVEN SOME POPULAR COMEDIANS MUSICIANS THINK THEY COULD EVEN INCLUDE AN ANIMATED SEGMENT AND INTRODUCE BOBA FETT

AND SINCE IT SEEMS LIKE ALL THE NEW FILMS ARE COMING OUT AROUND THE END OF THEIR GIVEN YEAR MAYBE THEY COULD MAKE IT HOLIDAY THEMED HAHA LIKE A STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL WOULDN'T EVERYONE LOVE TO SEE THAT
THE ENCOUNTER WITH THAT BOUNTY HUNTER ON ORD MANTELL
VADER SEARCHING FOR A STAR DESTROYER TO MAKE CONTACT WITH FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS CALL IT STRANDED IN SPACE A STAR WARS STORY
TSH WOULD RATHER HAVE A STANDALONE FILM FEATURING A CLONE PROTAGONIST DURING THE CLONE WARS THE PERIOD BETWEEN IV AND V IS ALREADY BEING TOLD THROUGH THE COMICS
PALATINE
I'M NOT SURE THEY WOULD DO A MOVIE DURING THIS TIME MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE FILLING THE GAP WITH THE COMICS AND NOVELS THAT BEING SIAM I'D LIKE TO SEE BOUNTY HUNTER ENCOUNTER ON ORD MANTELL ALTHOUGH I HAVE A FEELING WE WILL SEE THIS IN THE STAR WARS COMICS AND IT WOULD BE HARD TO DO THAT FILM WITHOUT YOUNG HARRISON FORD OR THE REASON WHY VADER TELLS BOBA FETT NO DISINTEGRATIONS ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SOLD ON A BOBA FETT CENTERED FILM AND THERES A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THAT LINE IN THE DARTH VADER COMICS

I HAVE ONE MORE IDEA BUT IT'S PRETTY FAR OUT THERE WHAT IF THERE WAS A STORY FOCUSED ON AFTER HE BECAME ONE WITH THE FORCE AT THIS POINT AND ARE THE ONLY ONES TO HAVE RETAINED THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS AFTER DEATH SO MAYBE THERES SOME SORT OF SUPERNATURAL STORY THAT COULD FOCUS ON THEM IN SOME CAPACITY I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT WOULD BE EXACTLY IT'S A THOUGHT
HONESTLY I THINK THEY COULD PULL OFF A SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE ANALOG WITHOUT HAVING ALL THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS IT WOULDN'T BE EASY BUT GOD DAMNED THAT WAS SUCH A COOL STORY WHAT WITH THE BLACK SUN SYNDICATE AND ALL IT WOULD BE FUCKING AWESOME TO HAVE DASH REIDAR BE CANON AGAIN
MAYBE A LIVE ACTION MOVIE FOR THE GHOST CREW OR A FILM FROM THE EMPIRES POINT OF VIEW
MAN WHAT I WOULDN'T DO TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK IN TIME AND STOP LUCAS FROM COMING UP WITH THE IDEA TO MAKE VADER INTO DAD TO SEE HOW THE MOVIES TURNED OUT IF THEY WERE JUST A BUNCH OF FUN SWASHBUCKLING ADVENTURES JUST VAGUELY CONNECTED TO ONE ANOTHER RATHER THAN THE TRILOGY WE WOUND UP WITH NOT THAT I'M SUGGESTING THOSE PULPY FILMS BEEN BETTER BUT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE FILMS TURNED OUT IF THEY WERE ALL MORE LIKE SPLINTER IN THE EYE RATHER THAN THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK

THAT SAID IF WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT A ONE-OFF BETWEEN STAR WARS AND EMPIRE I'D JUST HAVE A FUN FLICK ABOUT HAN LEIA AND LUKE TRYING TO LURE A BUNCH OF SPACE PIRATE BUDDIES OF TO JOIN THE REBELLION ALL WHILE THE REBELS ARE QUIETLY ESTABLISHING THE BASE ON HOTH

MAYBE TAKE A CUE FROM THE RADIO DRAMAS AND SHOW HOW THE STAR CRACKDOWN ON THE REBELLION IS KICKING THE REBELS ASSES AND HOW MUCH THE REBELLION NEEDS SOME HELP ESTABLISHING THE HOTH BASE WHICH RESULTS IN THE MAIN GANG BOPPING AROUND A FEW STAR SYSTEMS LOOKING FOR HELP WHILE LUKE IS FUSSING AROUND WITH HIS LIGHTSABER AND TRYING TO SUMMON THE SPIRIT OF BEN KENOBI AGAIN

OF COURSE THIS ALL ENDS UP ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF ONE OF BOUNTY HUNTERS BOBA FETT ON THE PIRATE COLONY OF ORD MANTELL WHICH HAN LEIA LUKE CHEWIE AND THE DROIDS BARELY ESCAPE FROM WITH LIFE AND LIMBS INTACT
I THINK A BOBA FETT MOVIE WOULD TIE IN WELL FOR EMPIRE MAYBE EVEN THE LAND FILM INCLUDING THE TAKE OVER OF CLOUD CITY
SPLINTER OF THE EYE LAO
I THINK THE OBVIOUS CHOICES WOULD BE EITHER WATCHING BETHANKS DIE OR AKBAR AND HIS MON CAL JOINING THE REBELLION

BOBA FETT BACKSTORY
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN BASE AN ENTIRE MOVIE OFF OF IT BUT LANDO LOSING THE FALCON TO HAN WOULD BE FUN TO SEE
I THINK HAN MEETING CHEWIE WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO START THE MOVIE WE ALSO HAVE TO SEE THE KESSEL RUN HAPPEN HAPPEN IN PARSECS I MEAN
I'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF HAN AS A CHARACTER LIKE SAY BOBA FETT BEFORE EPISODE II THE GUY SEEMS ONLY TOO EAGER TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT HIS PAST EXPLOITS AND PERSONALLY I'VE ENJOYED READING BOOKS ON THE VERY SUBJECT
IF THEY CAN SOMEHOW CRAM IN HOW HAN WON THE FALCON MET CHEWIE AND MADE THE KESSEL RUN I THINK THEY COULD MAKE A PRETTY INCREDIBLE MOVIE
HOW I MET YOUR BOOKIE SOUNDS LIKE AN EXCELLENT SPIN-OFF SHOW
TRY THE HAN SOLO LEGENDS BOOKS THEY GO INTO HIS YOUTH BUT ADD MORE MYSTERY TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT THEY DISPEL ALSO THE WRITING STYLE IS TOP NOTCH
WELL BACK IN THE EXPANDED UNIVERSE HAN SAVED CHEWIE WHILE WORKING FOR THE EMPIRE CHEWIE WAS AN UNRULY SLAVE THAT HAN WAS SUPPOSED TO SKIN AND KILL AFTER WHICH CHEWIE SWORE HIM A LIFE DEBT AND BECAME HIS SIDEKICK
EH I'D LOVE TO SEE SOME EXPLORATION OF CERELLIA GIVEN HOW SIGNIFICANT IT'S BEEN TO THE LORE BOTH CANON AND LEGENDS YOUNG SOLO COULD BE A GOOD VEHICLE FOR THAT
I WONDER IF EMILIA CLARKE IS THE ONE PLAYING YOUNG CHEWIE
I FELT THE SAME WAY ABOUT A HAN MOVIE WHEN IT WAS FIRST ANNOUNCED BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND HE'S THE ONLY MAIN CHARACTER WITH A BACKGROUND FULL OF STORIES WORTH TELLING LIFE MIGHT BE OKAY BUT IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE A CRIME DRAMA THAN STAR WARS LIFE WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HEAR ABOUT BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING IN THERE FOR A MOVIE I GUESS A LITTLE T AND WOMPRAT HUNTING BUT REALLY IT WOULD BE HIM COMPLAINING AND JERKING OFF TO BLOCKED BOLO CHANNELS REMEMBER HOW SURPRISED HE WAS WHEN HE SAW THE PRINCESS BOLO I BET YOU CREDITS HE JERKED IT TO THAT BEFORE WENT MISSING
I JUST DON'T WANT THEM TO MAKE HAN A GOOD GUY IT WILL WEAKEN HIS STORY ARC IN A NEW HOPE HE SHOULD BE A SLEAZEBALL AND A CON ARTIST

OR PERHAPS HE ENDS UP SAVING THE DAY BUT BY ACCIDENT HE WAS TRYING TO SAVE HIS OWN ASS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM SAVE CHERIES LIFE BY TOTAL ACCIDENT JUST TRYING TO SAVE HIMSELF OR MAKE MONEY AND CHEWIE GETS SAVED AND OWES HIM HIS LIFE
I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS

I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE CHEWIE A VERY SMALL PART OF THE SOLO MOVIE FOR SOME REASON
HOW I MET YOUR CHEWIE

HAASE YOU MET HAN
HOW HE MET LANDO HOW HE GOT THE FALCON HOW HE GOT IN WITH ABBA THE TIME HE DROPPED SHIPMENT THAT GOT HIM IN SO MUCH HOT WATER THE SANA SITUATION HIS FIRST SMUGGLING JOB THE KESSEL RUN
AS STAR WARS HAS TAUGHT US SOMETIMES A VAGUE BACKSTORY WHERE THE VIEWERS FILL IN THE BLANKS IS BETTER THAN A DETAILED EXPLANATION
ONE NAME BRIA
DIDN'T CHEWIE HAVE A TO HAN MAYBE HAN SAVED HIM FROM SOME SLAVERS OR SOMETHING
THIS WINTER COMING SOON TO TBS

HOW I MET YOUR BOOKIE
NEEDS A TV SERIES
HOW I MET YOUR WOOKIEE
I'M GOING WITH HE WINS THE FALCON FROM LANDO STUMBLES INTO SAVING CHEWIE AND HAS TO HAUL BALLS TO SAVE HIS OWN HIDE THUS MAKING THE KESSELL RUN IN PARSECS EMILIA IS A LOVE INTEREST THAT MEETS AN UNFORTUNATE END THUS MAKING HIM EVEN MORE JADED AND SELFISH MOVIE ENDS WITH HAN AND CHEWIE CHILLING IN THEIR APARTMENT ON A PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN PLANET PLAYING SOME 3D CHESS
IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING THOUGHT THAT I'VE HAD NOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING A BUNCH OF ANTHOLOGY FILMS SHOULD THE ANTHOLOGY FILMS KEEP THE SAGA MOVIES SECRETS OR IS IT OKAY TO GO DEEPER SINCE BASICALLY ALL OF US HAVE SEEN THE SAGA MORE TIMES THAN WE CAN COUNT

FOR EXAMPLE I'VE HEARD AND AGREE THAT ARC IN ANH IS PERFECT WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE THAT WELL IS THAT STILL TRUE WILL THE HAN SOLO MOVIE AFFECT YOUR OPINION OF ANH WILL IS CHANGE ANH IN ANY WAY

HONESTLY I'M NOT TOO SURE BUT I'M BEGINNING TO LEAN TOWARDS THE IDEA THAT THE ANTHOLOGY MOVIES SHOULDN'T BE OVERLY CONCERNED WITH THE SAGA MOVIES THIS IS A NEW ERA OF STAR WARS AND THERE'S REALLY NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO EMBRACE IT
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHAT THEY WANT UNTIL THEY GET IT I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE HAN SOLO PREQUEL BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT YOU PEOPLE WILL BE EATING THOSE WORDS WHEN THE MOVIE ACTUALLY COMES OUT

THERE'S PROBABLY LOTS OF THINGS FROM PAST THAT YOU WOULD ENJOY SEEING BUT SINCE YOU AND MANY OTHERS ARE ADAMANT THAT HIS MYSTERY IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT THEN YOU ARE AGAINST THE IDEA
HOW ABOUT HIS STORY OF MAKING THE KESSEL RUN IN LESS THAN PARSECS
UNPOPULAR OPINION I DON'T WANT THIS MOVIE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HAN SOLO I DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW HE MET CHEWBACCA I DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW HE GOT THE FALCON FROM LANDO GIVE ME A STORY THAT IS NOT ANY SORT OF ORIGIN FILM
WE ALREADY KNOW IT WELL WE DID WHO KNOWS WHAT IT IS NOW
WIKI

THE BOOK TRILOGY IS REALLY GOOD TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HAN LIKE MEETING CHEWIE AND RUNNING THE KESSEL RUN IN UNDER PARSECS THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE HAS HUNDREDS OF BOOKS THE MOVIES HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO REALLY FOLLOW THEM BUT IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO READ ANYWAY
COMPLETELY AGREE I DON'T THINK THIS MOVIE NEEDS TO BE MADE IN THE LEAST IT'S JUST A CASH GRAB
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAN AND CHEWIE SWINDLES GALORE AND AN ENCOUNTER WITH GREED AND I REALLY WANT TO SEE CERELLIA ESPECIALLY THE SEEDIER SIDE OF IT
I WONDER IF IN THE MOVIE THEY WILL HAVE INDIANA JONES DISCOVERING THE REMAINS OF THE MILLENNIUM FALCON WOULDN'T THAT BE FUN
HE ADOPTED HIM FROM A SHELTER

I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING HOW HAN WON THE FALCON OFF LANDO
IN THE LEGENDS HAN WAS AN IMPERIAL OFFICER AND REFUSED TO EXECUTE A BOOKIE PRISONER AND THEN CHEWIE SWORE A LIFE DEBT TO HIM
I COMPLETELY CONCUR
I HOPE HANS MOVIE ISNT ANY SPECIFIC STORY AND IS A LITTLE MORE MUNDANE ONE HEIST NO HUGE BATTLES NO MAJOR CONNECTIONS TO THE OTHER FILMS

EDIT
IT COULD BE KIND OF LIKE OCEANS IN SPACE
IN THE OLD EXPANDED UNIVERSE HAN WAS A RISING IMPERIAL OFFICER AND CHEWIE WAS A WOOKIEE SLAVE HAN SAW CHEWIE AND A BUNCH OF OTHER WOOKIEES IN CHAINS AND BEING BEATEN AND HE OBJECTED TO THE POINT OF FREEING THEM IT GOT HIM A DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE FROM THE EMPIRE AND A LIFE DEBT FROM CHEWIE AT FIRST HAN HATED IT BECAUSE ALL HE WANTED TO DO AFTER LOSING HIS ENTIRE CAREER WAS DRINK AND FORGET BUT CHEWIE WOULDN'T LEAVE HIM ALONE THEIR FRIENDSHIP GREW FROM THERE

PERSONALLY I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT MOVIE BUT IT'S PROBABLY TOO DARK FOR DISNEY AND I SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO LIKES DISNEY
I THINK YOU COULD RUN A MOVIE WITH ACTS OF THE FOLLOWING
HAN IN THE CORALLIAN MILITARY EARNING HIS BLOODSTRIPES
2 HAN LEAVING THE MILITARY WINNING THE FALCON FROM LANDO
HAN RESCUING CHEWIE FROM TRANDOSHAN SLAVERS AND THE MOVIE ENDS WITH THE TWO OF THEM ABOUT TO HEAD OFF ON AN ADVENTURE OF SOME SORT

EDIT WHO AM I KIDDING IN THIS DAY AND AGE I JUST DESCRIBED A SERIES OF MOVIES
THINK THEY'LL GO THE IMPERIAL DESERTER ROUTE
I THINK START THE FILM OFF WITH HAN DOING SOME SHADY SMUGGLER WORK FOR THE EMPIRE AND ALONG THE WAY MEETING CHEWIE AND SAVING HIS LIFE THEREBY SHOWCASING HOW HAN IS A DODGY CHARACTER BUT GOOD GUY ON THE INSIDE CHEWIE OWES A LIFE DEBT TO HAN AND ACCOMPANIES HIM ON HIS NEXT ENDEAVORS

ALONG THE WAY HAN WINS THE FALCON FROM LANDO

THE FINAL PART OF THE FILM IS HAN AND CHEWIE USING THE FALCON TO DO A DANGEROUS SMUGGLING MISSION WHICH INVOLVES DOING THE KESSEL RUN IN LESS THAN PARSECS MAYBE IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO IT IN LESS THAN BUT HAN KNOWS NO ONE CAN DISPUTE THE CLAIM SO HE GOES WITH IT ANYWAY

EDIT THINKING ABOUT IT MORE I REALLY HOPE THEY MAKE YOUNG HAN OUT TO BE A NASTY CHARACTER THAT YOU REALLY DESPISE AND TOWARD THE END OF THE FILM YOU CAN SEE HIM STARTING TO DEVELOP INTO A GOOD GUY I THINK THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ENHANCE HIS CHARACTER IN THE LATER STORY FOR ME
WHEN SOLO MET CHEWIE
THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS THAT COULD GO WRONG I'D RATHER NOT BE TOLD
OR HOW HE MET LANDO HOW HE GOT THE FALCON HOW HE MET ABBA THE HUT ETC
WE GOT EVERYTHING FROM BACKGROUND WE NEEDED ANYTHING ELSE IS JUST FLUFF TO PUT ASSES IN SEATS WITH THAT SAID I'LL PROBABLY BE RENTING IT AT REBOX UNLESS IT DOES REALLY WELL
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE FAMOUS KESSEL RUN
IMAGINE THE DIALOGUE

HAN SARCASTICAL REMARKS ABOUT HIS POOR LUCK

CHEWIE RAWRGLGRGLWAGWLRALGRRAAELW

THE WHOLE MOVIE WOULD BE 2 HOURS OF THIS BUT I WOULD STILL SEE IT
I JUST WANT ANDO TO BE IN THE MOVIE
JUST MY TWO CENTS ANY OTHER THOUGHTS

OTHER THOUGHTS WE GET IT R STARWARD DOESN'T WANT A HAN SOLO MOVIE YOUR ECHO IN THE ECHO CHAMBER HAS ECHOED YAY

IN A SUBREDDIT WHERE PEOPLE WON'T STU ABOUT ALL THE OTHER STORIES THAT COULD BE TOLD IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE WON'T STU ABOUT SUPER HERO MOVIES AND HOW THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A SPY MOVIE AND A DRAMA MOVIE AND A HORROR MOVIE USING MARVEL CHARACTERS I SAY THAT IT'S POSSIBLE SOMEONE COULD MAKE A HAN SOLO MOVIE THAT I WOULD ENJOY AND I'M A LITTLE FUCKING TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT HOW THE REST OF YOU HATE THE IDEA I GET IT ALREADY NOTE THAT I TOO WOULD ENJOY AN OBI WAN KENOBI MOVIE BUT GUESS WHAT THEY COULD MAKE BOTH
AS MUCH AS I LOVE BOOKIES AND I LOVE MAKING THE CHEWBACCA SOUND TO ANNOY MY FAMILY IF WE GET A MOVIE WHERE MOST OF THE DIALOGUE IS HAN TALKING AND THEN SHRYWOOK WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND I'LL GO FUCKING NUTS IN A BAD WAY BUT MAYBE THAT'S JUST ARMA
I FIGURED HAN SAVED CHEWIE FROM BEING A SLAVE AND NOW SERVES AS HIS COPILOT AS A LIFE DEBT
THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE PART OF WHATEVER MOVIE DISNEY MAKES ABOUT HAN STUFF LIKE THAT KINDA WRITES ITSELF AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT DISNEY WANTS SINCE THEY'RE MAKING A STAR WARS MOVIE EVERY YEAR
HOW DID HAN SOLO MEET CHEWBACCA
THE NOVEL THE HUTT GAMBIT EXPLAINS THAT CHEWIE AND SOLO FIRST MEET WHEN SOLO A LIEUTENANT IN THE IMPERIAL NAVY FINDS HIM UNCONSCIOUS ABOARD A SLAVE SHIP SOLO'S COMMANDING OFFICER ORDERS HIM TO SKIN CHEWIE BUT SOLO REFUSES AND RESCUES THE HELPLESS PRISONER UPON REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS CHEWIE SWEARS A TO SOLO AND THE TWO BECOME BUSINESS PARTNERS AND BEST FRIENDS

EMELIA CLARKE IS CHEWY IN THIS MOVIE
WHILE I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS THERE IS A PART OF ME THAT FEELS LIKE IT'S BETTER IN MY IMAGINATION AND EVERYONE PROBABLY HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE IDEA OF HOW IT HAPPENED I WOULD LOVE AN ORIGINAL STORY THAT WASN'T HELD UP TRYING TO STAY TRUE TO THE RESTRICTIONS OF CANON
SOMEONE HAD POSTED THIS PREVIOUSLY BUT I LIKED THE IDEA WHAT IF CHEWY WAS MORE LIKE FATHER HE FINDS HIM AS AN ABANDONED YOUNGSTER AND ADOPTS HIM
I AM A HUGE FAN OF HAN BUT I BELIEVE PART OF HIS MYSTERY IS WHAT MAKES HIM SO GOOD THE MORE THEY EXPLORE HIS CHARACTER THE MORE THAT MYSTERY GOES AWAY

WOULD PERFECTLY FIT ON BOBA TOO IF YOU ASK ME
I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING HIM BEATING LANDO IN WHATEVER BET HE WON THE MILLENNIUM FALCON IN BUT ALL IN ALL I PREFERRED THEY DIDN'T MAKE THIS MOVIE AT ALL
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM RACING ON CERELLIA AND BEATING DENAR WOULD BE A GOOD STORY HAVING THE VIEWER QUESTION MORALS AND IF DENAR TRULY IS A BAD GUY
IN THE EXTENDED UNIVERSE DIDN'T HAN SAVE FROM CHEWIE FROM BEING SKINNED WHILE SERVING IN THE IMPERIAL NAVY
WHAT WAS THE CARGO HE DROPPED THAT CAUSED ABBA TO HATE HIM HOW IS BOBA FETT CONNECTED TO HIM
WHILE NOT QUITE REFERENCING WHAT YOU POSTED THE HAN SOLO SERIES BY MARVEL IS REALLY GOOD READING
A BUDDY COP TYPE MOVIE WHERE A ROGUE ENDS UP DEVELOPING AN UNLIKELY FRIENDSHIP WITH A WALKING CARPET WOLD BE AMAZING
CHEWIE BETTER BE IN THE MOVIE I REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS YOUNG HAN MOVIE THOUGH I REALLY JUST DON'T CARE AT ALL WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR ME AND STAR WARS
I JUST WANT TO SEE THE RETAKING OF CORUSCANT BY THE LITTLE GUYS OF THE REBELLION NO MAIN
HOW I MET YOUR BOOKIE
ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND WERE JUST THINKING ABOUT THAT THIS WEEKEND IT'S A GREAT IDEA I HOPE THEY MAKE A MOVIE CONTAINING THE INFO
I WANT THEM TO CONFIRM THE WHOLE KESSEL RUN THING ABOUT HOW HE DID IT IN XX PARSECS

FAN THEORY IS ITS A RUN AROUND A BLACK HOLE MEANING MOST SHOPS HAVE TO STAY FURTHER AWAY AS THEY ARE TRAVELLING AT SPEEDS WHERE CLOSER THEY WOULD BE SUCKED IN THE FALCON IS SO FAST HE COULD RUN CLOSER TO THE EVENT HORIZON AND NOT BE SUCKED IN
HISTORY WITH LANDO OR ABBA OR THE FALCON
DID HE ACTUALLY MAKE THE KESSEL RUN
SOMETHING TELLS ME THE MOVIE WILL HAVE HIM ALREADY ESTABLISHED AS GOOD FRIENDS WITH LANDO THEY WILL TOGETHER SOMEHOW SAVE CHEWIE AND FOR SOME REASON HAVE TO MAKE THE KESSEL RUN

I STILL DON'T REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF THIS MOVIE BUT MORE LANDO IS ALWAYS GOOD ALSO LZ YOUNG BIEN NUB
I'D LOVE IT IF THEY AVOIDED ALL DRAMATIC IRONY AND JUST TOLD A HAN SOLO STORY THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORIES WE KNOW OR THINK WE KNOW

HAN SOLO AND LANDO CALRISSIAN IN THE STING BUT ON A GALACTIC SCALE
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY FOLLOWED THE HAN SOLO TRILOGY FROM BACK IN THE IT COVERS A LOT OF THEIR BACK STORY THE FIRST IN THE SERIES WAS HAN SOLO AT STARS END
BOBA FETT AND HAN WERE PARTNERS BUT HAD CONFLICT OVER WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE BOOKIE HAN CHOSE CHEWIE CREATING A FISSURE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE BOUNTY HUNTER
I'M CURIOUS IF THEY'LL KEEP WITH THE OLD WAY OF HOW HAN AND CHEWIE MET OR IF THEY'LL COME UP WITH A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY
LIFE DEBT
OR MAYBE THEY WILL SHOW HOW HE BETTED AND WON THE MILLENNIUM FALCON FROM LANDO BRIEFLY MENTIONED IN ESB AND OF COURSE KESSEL RUN IN LESS THAN TWELVE PARSECS I KNOW HE WAS BULLSHITTING BUT COOL TO SEE IN THE MOVIE
A COUNTY CRISPIN DONE THREAD
I KINDA DISAGREE CHEWIE IS A GREAT CHARACTER IN MODERATE DOSES BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY HE'S A CHARACTER WHO DOESN'T TALK DON'T REALLY WANT TO WATCH AN ENTIRE MOVIE JUST BASED ON THAT
THE KESSEL RUN IN PARSECS
IF YOU ADD IN HOW HAN AND LANDO MET HOW HAN GOT THE FALCON AND UPBRINGING IF HE EVER ATTENDED THE IMPERIAL ACADEMY LIKE HE DID IN LEGENDS I'D LIKE TO KNOW ALL THAT STUFF AS WELL ALSO ADD IN THE KESSEL RUN I WANT TO SEE IT AND WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
IN THE THRAWN TRILOGY THEY BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE THINGS HAN SAVED CHEWBACCA FROM SLAVERY AND THAT'S WHY CHEWIE IS ALWAYS WITH HIM BECAUSE HE OWES HIM A LIFE DEBT THEY ONLY TALK ABOUT THIS VERY BRIEFLY

THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW HAN GOT THE MILLENNIUM FALCON BY BEATING LANDO LANDO DIDN'T OFFER UP THE MILLENNIUM FALCON JUST ONE OF HIS SHIPS NOT EXPECTING HIM TO KNOW ABOUT THE FALCON YET AGAIN THEY BARELY TALKED ABOUT THIS
I AGREE SEEING HOW HE MET CHEWIE WOULD BE COOL PERSONALLY THOUGH I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTRIGUED WITH WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN HE AND THE REST OF THE GANG AND THAT BOUNTY HUNTER ON ORD MANTELL
I LOVE HAN SOLO HE IS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER OF ANY FRANCHISE LAST NIGHT WHILE WATCHING ESB I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT LINE WHERE CHEWIE GROWLS SOMETHING TO HAN AND HE RESPONDS WITH THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO I'M SURE HE'S FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THAT

I THINK HAN IS A CHARACTER THAT DOESN'T NEED A BACKSTORY TO BE ENTERTAINING BUT HAVING ONE TOLD DOESN'T HURT HIS CHARACTER AT ALL I THINK HAVING A FILM WHERE WE SEE THAT SOME OF THE STORIES HE'S TOLD ARE EXAGGERATED WOULD MAKE A GREAT STORY WE LEARN THAT SOME ARE TRUE SOME AREN'T AND WE ARE LEFT WONDERING ABOUT THE ONES NOT ADDRESSED

I RECOMMEND CHECKING OUT THE HAN SOLO TRILOGY SURE IT'S LEGENDS BUT IT IS SUCH A FUN SERIES OF BOOKS IF YOU LOVE HAN SOLO
I KIND OF WANT THEM TO BOND TO SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A COMMON FOOD OR DRINK THEN EVERYTHING CONTINUES FROM THERE EITHER THAT OR THEY WERE CHILDHOOD BUDDIES
COMING THIS FALL TO ABC HOW I MET YOUR BOOKIE
I CAN SEE WHAT YOU MEAN I WOULDN'T MIND I LITTLE INSIGHT INTO HIM BUT I AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE COOL TO LEAVE SOME MYSTERY THERE THAT BEING SAID I DO WANT TO SEE HIM AND CHEWY BOND
I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOMETHING TO DO WITH A LIFE DEBT BUT I COULD BE MISTAKEN
SAYS THE MOVIE IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO WITH GETTING THE FALCON FROM LANDO AND MEETING CHEWIE AS WELL AS HIS STORIED PAST WITH WOMEN AND THE EMPIRE

IT WON'T BE ABOUT ANY SINGLE THING
I AGREE WITH THE MYSTERY PART I DO NOT WANT TO SEE A NEW CAST AS THESE CLASSIC CHARACTERS IT WOULD BE FUN TO HAVE SEEN HAN AND LANDO TELL THESE STORIES IN A BAR WITH FRIENDS
I THINK THEY COULD TURN IT INTO SOMETHING INTERESTING IF HAN WAS WORKING FOR THE EMPIRE AND HE SEES THE BOOKIES ENSLAVED I'D IMAGE HE'D FEEL DISGUSTED FREE CHEWIE AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY HE MEETS LANDO AND WINS THE FALCON
CAN I GET AN AMEN
DDK HE'S NOT PARTICULARLY MYSTERIOUS THE ALLURE OF HIS CHARACTER COMES MORE FROM HOW BLUNT HE IS IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS
NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN THIS STORY I WANT THIS TO BE LEFT TO EVERYONE'S IMAGINATION
I WANT TO SEE HAN FIRST DOING BUSINESS WITH ABBA AND ABBA SHOWN IN A LIGHT WHERE HE SEEMS LIKE A GUY WHO YOU'D ACTUALLY WANT TO WORK FOR WE GOT A GLIMMER OF THAT IN THE DOCKING BAY SCENE FROM A NEW HOPE BUT IMAGINE ABBA LIKE ALBERT BROOKS IN DRIVE YOU REALLY WANT TO LIKE HIM BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A VIOLENT CRIMINAL STREAK JUST UNDER THE SURFACE

PLUS GIMME SIMON PEGG AS DENAR

ALSO WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO MAKE THE KESSEL RUN
ACCORDING TO THE HAN SOLO TRILOGY HE RESCUED HIM FROM IMPERIAL SLAVERY ALSO MADE THE PARSEC KESSEL RUN ON ACCIDENT AND WON THE FALCON FROM BOLO CARDS
SPOILERS I RECENTLY FINISHED THE THRAWN TRILOGY AND WHEN HE TELLS CHEWIE IT'S BEEN GREAT AND HE'S GONNA HAVE TO WATCH OVER THE TWINS HIT ME RIGHT IN THE FEELS
IT'S GOING TO BE SOME VARIATION OF THE LION WITH THE THORN IN HIS PAW THING RIGHT
I HAD A TRILOGY OF HAN SOLO AND CHEWIE STORIES YEARS BACK BY BRIAN DALEY ALL THREE STORIES WERE PRETTY DAMNED GOOD NO IDEA IF STARS END CORPORATE SECTOR AUTHORITY WILL FACTOR INTO THE NEW MOVIE BUT I THINK A PAIR OF FREIGHTER BUMS BOUNCING AROUND THE GALAXY HAS POSSIBILITIES
I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
THAT AND HIM GETTING THE FALCON I MEAN WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO KNOW I GUESS HOW HE BECAME A SMUGGLER
COMPLETELY ABREED
I DON'T KNOW I THINK I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE KESSEL RUN I REALLY FEEL LIKE A HAN SOLO MOVIE IS A WASTED OPPORTUNITY THOUGH THEY COULD HAVE DONE SO MANY OTHER THINGS INSTEAD











I LOVED RANDOMLY MEETING HAN AND CHEWIE IN THE PRISON BARGE STORY IN THE DEATH TROOPERS BOOK
DDK UNLESS THE TRAILER JUST BLOWS ME AWAY I HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN BACKSTORY LEAST FAVORITE SW CHARACTER
I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE ABOUT THERE BEING SOME SORT OF MYSTERY TO HIM I JUST LIKED THAT HE WASN'T ALL THAT IMPORTANT UNTIL HE CARELESSLY TOOK ON AN ELDERLY JEDI TWO DROIDS AND A FARMBOY AS PASSENGERS HE WAS SOME SPACE DUDE DOING SOME SPACE THINGS SMUGGLING THINGS I DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS BACKSTORY

THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT NEEDS TO STAY UNKNOWN OR ANYTHING JUST THAT I WAS NEVER FROTHING AT THE MOUTH TO LEARN HOW HAN LEARNED HOW TO CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO JUMP TO LIGHTSPEED
ISN'T THERE ALREADY A STORY TO THAT OR WAS THAT FAN FICTION
I DON'T WANT ANY KIND OF ORIGIN STORY FOR HAN CHEWIE HAN LANDO HAND LANDO FALCON I JUST WANT A MOVIE ABOUT A HAN SOLO THAT HAPPENS TO BE YOUNGER
I THINK IT'S IMPLIED IN THE MOVIES THAT HAN HAS HAD PREVIOUS ENCOUNTERS AND DEALINGS WITH ABBA THE HUTT AND BOBA FETT AND PERHAPS GREED TOO

I'M NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN A MOVIE ABOUT HAN I WOULD RATHER DISNEY BACK A FILM ABOUT KENOBI
I THINK IT'S IN THE NOW BOOK DEATH TROOPERS
CHARACTER ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A MYSTERY I REALLY DON'T GET WHY PEOPLE KEEP SAYING THIS FIRST IT STARTED WITH BOBA WHICH I CAN UNDERSTAND BUT NOW IT CARRIED OVER TO OTHER CHARACTERS AND EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING EVERY CHARACTER NEEDS TO BE MYSTERIOUS
I AGREE AND ALSO HOW HE GOT THE FALCON FROM LANDO
READ THE HAM SOLO SERIES OF BOOKS THEY ARE AMAZING
NO MATTER WHO'S DIRECTING THIS BEING A HARRISON FORD CHARACTER I CAN ONLY PICTURE CHEWIE PLAYING THE ROLE OF SHORT ROUND FROM INDIANA JONES AS THEY BUILD UP THEIR RELATIONSHIP
PRETTY SURE IT HAPPENED WHEN HAN WON THE FALCON FROM LANDO IN A CARD GAME
THE HAN SOLO TRILOGY IS A GOOD STARTING POINT IF YOU WANT EXTENDED UNIVERSE I KNOW IT'S NOT CANON BUT THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY STORY THAT EXISTS HAS THEM I THINK
THANK GOD MORE IMAGINATIVE PEOPLE ARE WRITING THE MOVIES
I HAVE NEVER BEEN A BIG FAN OF STEVE JOBS BUT ONE THING THAT HE SAID REALLY STUCK WITH ME A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT UNTIL YOU SHOW IT TO THEM IT IS SO TRUE I TAKE MORE PLEASURE IN DISCOVERING SOMETHING THAT I NEVER KNEW THAT I WANTED
I'D SAY THE REASON YOU DON'T SEE A NEED FOR TELLING HAN SOLO STORIES IS THAT HIS CHARACTER IN THE MOVIES IS FAIRLY TWO DIMENSIONAL AS WRITTEN THERE'S REALLY NOT ANY HINT THAT HE HAD AN EXCEPTIONAL LIFE BEFORE MOS BISLEY AND HIS CHARACTER ARC ACROSS THREE MOVIES DOESN'T SEEM THAT BIG
THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH HAN SOLO BEING THE STAR OF ONE POSSIBLY MORE SPIN-OFF MOVIE S IS THAT HIS CHARACTER ARC TAKES PLACE IN THE STAR WARS OT AS A RESULT WE KIND OF PUT THAT CHARACTER INTO A PARTICULAR BOX FOR ANY STORY THAT TAKES PLACE PRIOR TO A NEW HOPE I'M EXCITED FOR THE HAN SOLO MOVIE BECAUSE STAR WARS BUT I DON'T THINK HE IS A CHARACTER THAT NEEDS A SPIN-OFF
REMINDME IN TWO YEARS TO ASK THIS GUY ABOUT HAN SOLO'S MOVIE
I WANT TO SEE HOW HE GOT MIXED UP SMUGGLING FOR GALACTIC CRIME LORDS AND HOW HE CAME TO BE ON THE RUN FROM ABBA THE HUTT
I REMEMBER SEEING SOMEWHERE AND I CAN'T REMEMBER IF IT'S CANON OR NOT HOWEVER I BELIEVE HAN ORIGINALLY WAS A STORM-TROOPER OR SOMETHING AND CHEWIE WAS A PRISONER OF THE EMPIRE AND THEY ESCAPED TOGETHER

IT MAY HAVE BEEN A FAN MADE COMIC BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER
IN THE BOOK DARK TROOPER HAN AND CHEWIE WERE ON A PRISON BARGE AND A DISEASE BROKE OUT TURNING STORM TROOPERS IN TO ZOMBIES CHEWIE GOT THE DISEASE AND HAN INOCULATED HIM AND SAVE HIS LIFE
IF I RECALL WASN'T THERE A SCRAPPED KASHYYYK SCENE IN REVENGE OF THE SITH WHERE CHEWBACCA WOULD BE WITH A YOUNG HAN I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IDEA WAS COOL HAN GROWING UP WITH CHEWIE PRACTICALLY BEING AN HONORARY WOOKIEE
DASH PLEASE
I WAS ALWAYS HOPING THE HAN SOLO STORY WOULD BE HIM AS YEAR OLD WITH CHEWIE AS HIS CAR TAKER OF SORTS
I'M MORE INTERESTED IN A MOVIE ABOUT WHAT APPEND AFTER THEIR MEETING

AS EXPLORED IN THE OLD NOVEL DEATH TROOPERS THEY GET STUCK IN A PRISON TRANSPORTER FREEING WOOKIESLAVES IS NOT WELL RECEIVED BY THE EMPIRE AND THEN A ZOMBIE OUTBREAK HAPPENS


I WANT THAT MOVIE
THAT WOULD BE NICE THERE'S A BOOK SERIES ABOUT THAT ALTHOUGH YOU COULD ARGUE IF IT'S CANNON OR NOT
PRETTY SURE IT WAS CONFIRMED EARLY ON THAT THIS WOULD BE A BIG PART OF THE MOVIE BUT THAT WAS BEFORE IT WAS EVEN CAST LIKE MARCH
HAN EARNING THE NICKNAME SLICK
HAN MEETING CHEWIE
HAN WINNING THE FALCON
THE KESSEL RUN

IF I DON'T GET OF THESE AND THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY THE ONLY ONE THAT I CAN LIVE WITHOUT SINCE IT ISN'T TECHNICALLY CANON ANYMORE I'LL BE MORE THAN A LITTLE ANNOYED

TOUCHING ON BLOODSTRIPES WOULD BE COOL AND WOULDN'T BE TOO HARD SINCE THE WAY HE MET CHEWIE KINDA INVOLVED HIS MILITARY SERVICE ALSO NOT CANON ANYMORE
MAYBE A MOVIE WHERE HE MEETS CHEWIE ENDING IN LANDO LOSING THE FALCON
IS NO ONE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THE HAN AND LEIA LOVE SCENE AND BY LOVE I MEAN SEX
THIS IS LITERALLY LIKE THE LEAST INTERESTING THING FOR ME PLEASE JUST START THE MOVIE AND THEY ARE FRIENDS ALREADY
WHAT IF THEY SHIT ON THE ORIGIN AND MAKE HAN A BOUNTY HUNTER IN TRAINING ONE OF HIS FIRST BOUNTIES IS A RUNAWAY WOOKIEE AT FIRST IT'S A ROAD MOVIE LIKE MIDNIGHT RUN BUT IN THE END HAN FREES CHENEY AND MAKES HIM HIS FIRST MATE
HAN AND CHENEY GET RECRUITED BY ABBA TO JOIN AN ELITE TEAM OF SMUGGLERS HAN DOESN'T LIKE WHAT THEY'RE SMUGGLING AND LEAVES
HAN THEN MEETS A GIRL AND SETTLES DOWN THEN ABBA COMES AND TELLS HIM THAT SOMEONE IS TAKING OUT THEIR OLD TEAM HAN WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT BUT LATER HIS GIRL IS DEAD FROM CLAW MARKS
HAN THEN JOINS ABBA IN TRACKING DOWN THE KILLER ALONG THE WAY HE GOS TO BLOWS WITH BOBA FIGHTS CHEWBACCA AND LATER JOINS FORCES WITH CHEWBACCA AGAINST A SUPER MODIFIED CLONE OF BOBA ANGO WHO HAS FORCE POWERS
IN THE END HAN GETS SHOT IN THE HEAD BY ABBA AND LOSES MEMORIES OF THIS WHOLE ADVENTURE
YES THAT WOULD BE A CRUCIAL PART OF THE HAN SOLO MOVIE HOWEVER I THINK WE NEED TO HOPE ARIAN HAS MORE AHAB SUBTLETY TOUCHED ON CHERIES PAIN IN I THINK HANS DEATH NEEDS TO PLAY MORE OF A ROLE THAN A POSSIBLE REDEMPTION OF BEN BUT ALSO BRING CHEWIE FORWARD AS A CHARACTER YOU WOULD THINK HEWOULD ONLY GET INCREASINGLY WORSE WITH ANGER AS TIME PASSES I THINK FORCE AWAKENS FAILED TO SHOW US THE TRUE IMPACT HANS DEATH HAD ON CHEWBACCA
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEEN MENTIONED YET BUT I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING HOW HAN GOT THE BOUNTY ON HIS HEAD FROM ABBA
I'M HOPING THAT THE HAN FILM HAS SOME NICE CAMEOS IN IT I'D LIKE TO SEE A HAN OR BEFRIENDS HIM DURING THE FILM THERE'S POTENTIAL TO SHOW A BIT OF HIS BACKGROUND WITH BOBA FETT JANNA AND LANDO I KNOW BANDOS GOING TO BE IN IT
THAT'D BE AWESOME YEAH

I JUST WANT A MOVIE LIKE THAT BUT ALSO WITH LANDO AND BOBA FETT THAT WOULD BE THE MOST BADASS MOVIE IN RECENT HISTORY
PURE OCEAN'S ELEVEN RIP OFF
HAN FRESH OUTTA IMPERIAL JAIL FOR BEING CAUGHT SMUGGLING ALREADY HAS HIS NEXT JOB PLANNED STEALING FROM TATTOOING CASINO

FORMING A CRACK TEAM WITH HIS BUDS CHEWIE LANDO AND AT THAT TIME GREED WHO HE PROCEEDS TO DOUBLE CROSS HENCE THE ANIMOSITY AND THROW IN OTHERS LIKE DENAR BOSK THE OTHER BOUNTY HUNTERS HELL EVEN THROUGH NEIN NUB AND THAT PRUNE FACE FROM CLONE WARS REBELS HELL DO THE GEORGE LUCAS APPROACH AND SHOE HORN IN ALL BOUNTY HUNTER SMUGGLERS IN THE UNIVERSE

DAENERYS IS THE EX WIFE JULIA ROBERTS

BAM HUGE SECESS BAM HUGE MONEY
THAT IS THE BIGGEST STORY I DON'T WANT TO SEE IN THE MOVIE
READ THE HAN SOLO TRILOGY PARADISE SNARE THE BUTTS GAMBIT AND REBEL DAWN YOU BASICALLY GET HIS ENTIRE BACK STORY ITS QUITE GOOD
ID LIKE TO KNOW HOW HE GOT MIXED UP WITH ABBA AND OWES ALL THOSE CREDITS
I DUNNO TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE HAN WAS NEVER A GOOD SMUGGLER AND LUKE WAS NEVER A GOOD JEDI

WE'VE RAISED THEM TO LEGENDS OVER THE PAST YEARS AND I THINK THE NEW MOVIES ARE REVEALING THE UNFORTUNATE TRUTH
I THINK HAN RESCUED CHEWIE FROM TRANDOSHAN SLAVERS
I THINK THE HAN MOVIE IS NOT NEEDED BUT IF LUCAS REALLY DID PLAN IT BEFORE THE DISNEY SALE THEN I'M SURE IT'S A STORY WORTH TELLING IN FILM FORMAT
SOMETIMES NOT SEEING SOMETHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SEEING IT

WHATEVER IS PUT IN SCREEN FOR CHEWBACCA TO DEDICATE HIMSELF TO HAN OR FOR LANDO TO LOSE THE FALCON TO HAN IS NOT GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS WHAT WE HAVE IMAGINED FOREVER
DIDN'T HAN SAVE CHEWIE WHEN HE WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM IMPERIAL TRAINING HE WAS ORIGINALLY AN IMPERIAL CAPTAIN IN TRAINING BUT DECIDED HE HATED THE EMPIRE AND DECIDED TO DESERT ON HIS WAY OUT HE FOUND CHEWIE LOCKED IN A CAGE BOUND FOR EXTERMINATION SO HE SPRUNG HIM THUS EARNING CHERIES LIFE DEBT

I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS
WHAT IF THEY MADE SOMETHING UP THAT WAS MORE EXCITING THAN ANYTHING THAT'S COME IN THE MOVIES SO FAR

WE DON'T NEED TO CONNECT EVERYTHING TO THE REST OF THE SERIES IT MAKES THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE SMALLER
I WANT JUMP STREET IN SPACE THE STORY DOESN'T MATTER

PROBABLY LESS SILLY BUT I HOPE HUMOR IS THE DRIVING FACTOR
I HAVE HIGHLY ENJOYED THE BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT HISTORY WHICH MEANS I PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE A MOVIE TRYING TO RETELL IT UNLESS THEY BASE IT ON THE BOOKS I'VE PRETTY MUCH GIVEN UP ON REALLY ENJOYING ANY NEW MOVIES SINCE THEY DECIDED THE EXPANDED UNIVERSE IS THAT OLD EXTENDED UNIVERSE WILL ALWAYS BE THE REAL STAR WARS TO ME

EDIT I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THIS BUT IMAGINE BEING TOLD A STORY AND KNOWING THE CHARACTERS THEN HEARING DIFFERENT STORIES ABOUT THOSE CHARACTERS AND GETTING TO KNOW THEM BETTER AND BETTER TO THE POINT WHERE YOU FEEL ALMOST LIKE YOU ARE CLOSE FRIENDS OK NOW PRETEND THAT SOMEONE COMES UP TO YOU AND SAYS EVERYTHING YOU EVER KNEW ABOUT THOSE FRIENDS AND STORIES IS WRONG AND INSTEAD IT'S SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THAT'S HOW IT FEELS TO BE TOLD THE BOOKS ARE AND IT'S A LOT EASIER TO CLING TO THE LARGE AND DEVELOPED UNIVERSE THAT I'VE GROWN UP LOVING THAN IT IS TO ABANDON IT ALL IN THE HOPES THAT A GIANT CONGLOMERATE BUILDS SOMETHING NEW AND BETTER
I HAVE NO FAITH IN A MOVIE ABOUT HAN HIS LEGACY IS TOO BIG ESPECIALLY AFTER GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE WITH ORIGINS IT SEEMS DESTIN TO FAIL
WASN'T THE REASON HE LEFT THE ACADEMY TO SAVE CHEWIE
I'D PREFER THE OLD EU WHICH TALKED ABOUT IT ENOUGH
GRIND CASE CLOSED
COMPLETELY AGREE I'M KIND OF WORRIED THAT ALL OF THESE MOVIES COMING OUT ARE GOING TO WEAR OUT STAR WARS FOR ME I'VE WATCHED THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY PROBABLY TIMES BUT ALL THESE EXTRA MOVIES JUST MIGHT BE TOO MUCH
I JUST DON'T WANT THIS MOVIE TO HAVE MARVEL HUMOR OR ANY STAR WARS MOVIE TO HAVE MARVEL HUMOR EPISODE DID IT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S ALMOST MY LEAST FAVORITE STAR WARS MOVIE
I LOVE HAN BUT I AM NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN THE MOVIE ESPECIALLY WITH DONALD GLOVER IN IT
REMOVED
LINK

EDIT AND SET THE DATE TO DEC
THE SITE PROBABLY JUST SCREWED UP FOR SOME THEATERS
TICKETS DON'T SEEM TO BE AVAILABLE ANYMORE INTERESTING NONETHELESS
BECAUSE IT'S DOPE AS FUCK
BESIDES ALL THE JOKE ANSWERS HERE I THINK AND DON'T QUOTE ME ON THIS THAT I READ HIS CAPE IS MADE OUT OF ARMORWEAVE AND IT CAN DEFLECT BLASTER BOLTS

LIKE LASER KEVLAR
WHY NOT
I MEAN HE'S A SITH LORD
BECAUSE CAPES ARE PRETTY WIZARD
YOU QUESTION VADER WITH A CAPE BUT FORGET ABOUT LANDO
MANY SW CHARACTERS WEAR CAPES
IT'S DOPE
WHY DOES YODA HAVE A TUNIC NO ONE'S GONNA SEE HIM NAKED

WHY IS THE EMPEROR EVIL

WHY A WAR IN THE STARS

WHY LUCAS
BECAUSE HE MAKES IT LOOK GOOOOOOOD
BECAUSE IT LOOKS COOL ON SCREEN
IN STAR WARS REASONING I BELIEVE THE LASER KEVLAR

IN REAL WORLD REASONING PROBABLY BECAUSE OF DRACULA
IF YOU WERE A DARK LORD OF THE SITH WOULDN'T YOU
BECAUSE HE LOOKS KINDA DUMB WITHOUT IT HTTPS
I HAVE NO IDEA

ALTHOUGH INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH KALO REN IS RUMORED TO BE WEARING DARTH CAPE IN EPISODE VIII
HE WATCHED TOO MUCH SEINFELD
I DON'T KNOW WHY DID COUNT DOOK WEAR A CAPE CAPES ARE LIKE A FASHION STATEMENT OF POWER AND INTIMIDATION FOR SITH LORDS
PEOPLE WILL QUESTION EVERYTHING NOWADAYS
HE GOT A BIG OL ASS I MEAN KARDASHIAN SIZED DONK
I DO AGREE THAT IT IS ONE OF STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE MOMENTS BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YODA ISN'T ABLE TO DO IT KALO STOPS ONE BLASTER BOLT DURING A CALM SITUATION WHEREAS YODA HAS NEVER BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE HE NEEDED TO DO THAT IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE FOR YODA TO FOCUS TO STOP BLASTER BOLTS DURING THE CLONE WARS WHEN YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF DROIDS SHOOTING AT YOU
THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE IS A PATHWAY TO MANY ABILITIES SOME CONSIDER TO BE UNNATURAL
I MEAN VADER STOPPED A BLASTER BOLT IN EMPIRE IT LOOKED DIFFERENT AND YOU COULD MOSTLY CHALK THAT UP TO SPECIAL EFFECTS BUT IT WAS THE SAME PRINCIPLE
WELL THE POINT OF KALO REN IS HE'S RAW POWER HE DOESN'T HAVE THE SKILL OR TECHNIQUE YET HE IS UNREFINED REY IS SIMILAR EXCEPT SHE SHOWS TI HAVE MUCH MORE RAW POWER REY MAY BE NEW TO THE FORCE BUT SHE IS NO BOOB FOR ALL WE KNOW SHE COULD END UP BEING AS STRONG OR STRONGER THAN YODA OR ANAKIN OR LUKE IN THE FORCE REMEMBER THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE YEAH THAT'S THE FORCE AWAKENING INSIDE REY
I'M NOT BUYING IT

THAT'S GREAT CAUSE SELLING IT IT IS WHAT IT IS AND YOUR APPROVAL ISN'T WANTED NOR NECESSARY TO THE EXISTENCE OF IT IN THE MOVIE

ALSO IT'S A PLAY ON ABSORPTION OF SHOTS IN ESB WHO COMPLETELY NULLIFIES THE SHOTS WITH THE FORCE
REN IS MEANT TO BE POWERFUL IN THE FORCE JUST NOT VERY STABLE
VADER DID SOMETHING SIMILAR IN ESB
YEAH THEY SHOULD NEVER INTRODUCE OTHER FORCE POWERS S
AS PLAYED BY WARWICK DAVIS
THIS IS MY INSTAGRAM IF AT ALL INTERESTED
GEORGETONKZ
APPRECIATE ANY FEED BACK
MANY THANKS

G
LOVE IT GTONKS MIGHT HAVE TO BUY ONE
VERY CAREFULLY
HE HAS A ACTIVE REPULSORLIFT GENERATORS AND LITTLE CLAWS THAT PROTRUDE THE CIRCLES ARE THE EMITTERS IT PUSHES AGAINST GRAVITY IT'S HOW HE ROLLS TOOL GOING UP STAIRS REQUIRES HIS EMITTERS TO GO NEARLY IT IS A BIT HARD ON BATTERY LIFE
IF I HAD TO MAKE A GUESS I'D SAY THAT HE USES THOSE TOW CABLES THAT HE USES TO KEEP FROM ROLLING AROUND THE FALCON WHEN REY AND FINN HIJACK IT
MAYBE HE HAS A ROCKET THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SHOWN OR MENTIONED S
LEAN HEAD OVER THE NEXT STAIR GO FORWARD VERY QUICKLY AND CATAPULT UP

OR USE THAT TETHER THING
A FUN DROID BUT KIND OF A POOR FORM ON ANYTHING BUT SMOOTH SURFACES
SAME AS
HE PROBABLY PULL HIMSELF UP WITH HIS GRAPPLING HOOKS
OKAY
WHAT
THERE IS A NINETY-SEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT CHANCE THAT I WILL BUY THIS MAGAZINE
NEEDS MORE CHROME LIKE
DON'T YOU MEAN SLOKED
I'LL SEE MY WAY OUT
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ANCHORHEAD THEY WERE THE FIRST STAR WARS METAL BAND I EVER LISTENED TO IF YOU LIKE METAL AND STAR WARS YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO LISTEN TO SHREDISODE IV
THESE GUYS SOUND LIKE THE MUSICAL EMBODIMENT OF R EMPIREDIDNOTHINGWRONG
DUDE THIS IS AMAZING WHERE DID YOU GET THE DESIGN FILES FROM
IS THIS LIKE AN EU DESIGN NEVER SAW AN WITH LASERS ON TOP OF THE HEAD
THE PROBLEM IS THAT ANIMATION IS VERY EXPENSIVE EACH EPISODE OF ACW COST MORE THAN MILLION WHICH IS MORE THAN THE COST OF ONE SEASON OF REBELS

IT WOULDN'T BE VERY PROFITABLE AS A TV SERIES BUT AS A FEATURE FILM MAYBE
I THINK IT WOULD BE COOL IF THEY DID SOMETHING A LA TALES FROM THE MOS BISLEY CANTINA OR SOMETHING A BUNCH OF SHORT STORIES KINDA LIKE THE ANIMATRIX WITH A LOT OF THE BACKGROUND CHARACTERS
HALO DOES LITTLE SHORTS EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE SUCH AS THE MONA LISA AND ALL THOSE TERMINAL ENTRIES IN THEIR GAMES WHICH ARE ALL GODDAMN BRILLIANT STAR WARS NEEDS TO ADOPT THIS METHOD THEY ALREADY DO BY MAKING SHORT STORIES IN THEIR STAR WARS INSIDER ISSUES BUT I'D RATHER HAVE SOME COOL QUICK ANIMATION RATHER THAN TEXT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TOP NOTCH LIKE I SAID HALO HANDLES IT PERFECTLY AND WITHIN THEIR BUDGET

HUNT THE TRUTH WAS ALSO A GODDAMN BRILLIANT AUDIO SERIES WHERE THEY RELEASED A NEW AUDIO SEGMENT EPISODE EVERY COUPLE WEEKS IT WAS BASICALLY ABOUT JOURNALIST INVESTIGATING WHAT HAPPENED TO MASTER CHIEF I'D FUCKING LOVE FOR STAR WARS TO COPY THAT AND HAVE A NEW REPUBLIC JOURNALIST GO AROUND AND TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THE DEATH STAR BETWEEN PALPS LUKE AND VADER DIGGING DEEPER AND DEEPER UNTIL THEY REACH DEPTHS OF INFORMATION THAT THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN MAYBE EVEN TRY TO FIND OUT IF VADER IS STILL ALIVE BECAUSE IT'S CANON THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW OR STILL THINK HE IS DUE TO THE EMPIRE'S LIES SAME WITH THE EMPEROR
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE DOWN VOTING YOU
MIND IF I ASK HOW YOU PURCHASED THEM I DO NOT SEE THEM LISTED ON FANDANGO YET
YEAH WE WOULD ALL KNOW IF THEY WERE REALLY AVAILABLE THERE WOULD BE POSTS ON REDDIN
WHAT COUNTRY ARE YOU LOCATED IN
JUST CALLED AN AMC NEAR ME AND THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY FOR SALE I ASKED WHEN THEY MIGHT BE AND SHE WENT TO GO CHECK CAME BACK AND SAID AROUND DECEMBER 1ST
I HAVE NO IDEA IF ANY OTHER THEATER CAN SELL THEM MY TWO PRONGED SUGGESTION IS EITHER CALL THEM DIRECTLY OR GO THERE IN PERSON AND ASK THEM TO PULL UP THE DATE TO CHECK AND SEE IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE
JAMES HORNER WROTE THE SCORE FOR ALIENS IN A BRUTALLY SHORT TIME AND THAT TURNED OU PRETTY BLOODY GOOD FINGERS CROSSED HERE


IT'S JUST A CLASSIC LOOK AND AT THIS POINT I WOULD ARGUE IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT LIGHTSABER IN THE GALAXY
MINE WAS ALWAYS ROTC ONE BECAUSE GREEN
SALELE STAFF AS SEEN IN THE CINEMATIC TRAILERS
HERE AND HERE HETP I LOVE ITS LOOK AND SHAPE ESPECIALLY HOW IT'S WIDER AT THE ENDS THAN IN THE MIDDLE
OR THE T AMPLE GUARD PIKES
TEMPLE GUARDS YELLOW BLADES
FUNGI
HOPPO RANCISIS
I LOVED
MASTER LIGHTSABER CANE FROM ACW
THE ORIGINAL GRAFLEX

ALSO REALLY LIKE TWO PART SABER
ASOKA ACW NOT REBELS I ALSO REALLY LIKE CLONE WARS EPISODE SABER ANOTHER RUNNER UP IS GREEN SABER IN REBELS SEASON
OG LIGHSABER OR MACE
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN PARTIAL TO SABER FROM ANH SLIGHTLY RUSTED AND BUT STILL ELEGANT
THE ONE THE BOOKIE PADAWAN CREATES IN ACW I MEAN WOOD JUST LOOKS COOL
LEGENDS IS CADE CANON WOULD BE DARTH LIGHTSABER THAT WE NEVER SEE IN THE FILM
ONE OF OR CAN NEVER DECIDE IS LIKE A MIX OF OBI WAN AND QUI WHICH IS COOL TOO
CANON ROTC SABER VISUALLY SIMILAR TO AND FELT LIKE A WONDERFUL TRIBUTE TO HIS FALLEN MASTER AND FRIEND TO DESIGN HIS FIRST PERSONAL LIGHTSABER AFTER I ALSO FELT THAT IT WAS VISUALLY MORE INTERESTING THAN LIGHTSABER NO MATTER HOW MORE ICONIC THAT ONE WAS

EU TOUGH CHOICE AS THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD ONES HERE I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO WITH A FEW HERE PURPLE SABER WAS ALWAYS AN INTERESTING LOOK TO ME I WOULDN'T MIND HAVING A REPLICA OF THAT ONE CONRAN SABER WAS A UNIQUE IDEA THAT I LOVED IN THE BOOKS SABER FROM THE JEDI KNIGHT GAME WHILE SIMPLISTIC IN IT'S DESIGN THE FACT KYLE TAKES IT UP THROUGH THE GAME AND BEYOND GAVE ME MY LOVE OF YELLOW LIGHTSABERS IF I HAD TO HAVE ANYTHING ASIDE FROM RED SITH SABERS I'D GO DUAL YELLOW AND PURPLE MYSELF TEEL LIGHTSABER AND THE LIGHTSABERS OF THE ONE SITH WERE ALWAYS VISUALLY INTERESTING AND A NICE DEPARTURE FROM THE METALLIC LOOKS OF THE WEAPONS AND FINALLY I HAVE TO GIVE PROPS TO WEAPON IN THE SITH ENDING OF FORCE UNLEASHED THE DESIGN WITH THE SPIKES ON THE EMITTER IT JUST FIT HIS AGGRESSIVE DESIGN SO WELL AND IS ANOTHER ONE I WOULD LOVE A PROP OF
LIGHTSHIPS
LIGHTSABER THE GREEN BLADE JUST FIT HIS SUPER WISE VIBE WELL
THE DEATH SABER THAT DEATH WATCH HAD IN ACW
KYLE THIRD LIGHTSABER I LIKE THE SHAPE OF THE THING SECOND WOULD BE REBELS LIGHTSABERS THOSE ARE THE ONES I WOULD PERSONALLY USE TOO
1ST FUNGI

2ND LUCIEN DRAY

3RD RAHM KOTA
SALELE DOUBLE-BLADED LIGHTSABER IS PRETTY SICK BUT I ALSO KINDA REALLY LIKE KAJDAN ARATUS DESIGN

AND OH HELICOPTER LIGHTSABERS FROM REBELS ARE AORTA COOL I MEAN YES USING THEM TO FLY IS DUMB BUT I LIKE THEM THEY'RE SOMETHING NEW
FANTASTIC I LOVE THE WAY YOU ACCENTED THE FOREGROUND WITH THE LITTLE STONES
CLASSY
THEY WERE BOTH BAD THE REPUBLIC SENATE WAS CORRUPT EVEN BEFORE PALAY BECAME CHANCELLOR FOR EXAMPLE MEGACORPORATIONS AND BANKS LIKE THE TRADE FEDERATION AND THE BANKING CLAN HELD SEATS ON THE SENATE ITS THE EQUIVALENT TO IF APPLE OR JP MORGAN HAD A SENATOR OR REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSIONAL ALSO THEY DECLARED WAR ON THE SEPARATISTS JUST FOR LEAVING IF CALIFORNIA HAD CHOSE TO LEFT THE US WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO DECLARE WAR ON THEM TO FORCE THEM TO STAY

MANY REAL SEPARATISTS CHOSE TO LEAVE THE REPUBLIC BECAUSE THEY SAW IT AS CORRUPT NOW THE CIS IS CONSIDERED BAD BECAUSE DOOK TOOK OVER THE MOVEMENT AS A LEADER AND YOU AND I KNOW HE IS APPRENTICE

BLDR BOTH SIDES HAD GOOD INTENTIONS BUT WERE FUCKED UP BY THEIR CORRUPT LEADERSHIP
NOT MUCH ACTUALLY THE POINT IS TAKEN UP IN THE RECENT REBELS EPISODE TITLED THE LAST BATTLE KINDA
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I LAST WATCHED TPM BUT DIDN'T THE SEPARATIST TRIED TO OUTRIGHT KILL AND WHEN THEY WENT TO HELP WITH THE PEACE TALKS WHY WERE THEY DOING A BLOCKADE ON BABOO EDIT NEVERMIND WENT TO READ ON THE WIKI MOSTLY INSTIGATED BY PALATINE AND HAD NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO GO THROUGH WITH IT OK
I BET HE DEFINITELY WONDERED WHAT'S THE POINT OF LIVING ANYMORE BUT HIS ANGER AND HATRED AND THE DARK SIDE PROBABLY SPURRED HIM ON AND KEPT HIM GOING
ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE OLD LEGENDS CIRC COMICS HE WAS DEFINITELY VERY SELF LOATHING AND HE STABBED HIMSELF TO GET AT DARTH MAUL
HE PROBABLY THOUGHT ABOUT CRASHING HIS FIGHTER INTO THRONE ROOM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO TAKE THEM BOTH OUT BUT I THINK HE STILL WANTED TO BRING ORDER TO THE GALAXY AND THOUGHT THAT THE EMPIRE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO HE FOCUSED ON THAT INSTEAD
HE DISPLAYS SOME BASIC WILL TO SURVIVE IE DRAGGING HIMSELF OUT OF LAVA-LIT AFTER GETTING

I ALWAYS IMAGINED IT WAS HIS RAGE ITSELF THAT KEPT HIM GOING ALSO PROBABLY DARK SIDE POWERS MAY PROVIDE DESIRE TO SUSTAIN ONESELF DUE TO ATTACHMENT EMOTION ETC

IN THE OLD CANON HE BROUGHT A BUILDING DOWN ON HIMSELF IN AN ATTEMPT TO KILL BOTH HIMSELF AND HIS TARGETS WHICH SUCCEEDED BY HE KILLED HIS TARGETS BUT HE SURVIVED AND CLAIMED IT WAS THE WILL OF THE FORCE OR SOME SHIT
I SWEAR THIS IS ASKED ALMOST DAILY PLEASE USE THE SEARCH BAR

ANAKIN WASN'T A JEDI HE WAS A SITH LORD HIS TROOPERS WERE OBVIOUSLY TOLD HE WAS AN ALLY

WHY CAN PEOPLE NOT PIECE THAT TOGETHER
IS YOUR SECOND QUESTION REFERRING TO ORDER OR AFTER THAT
BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD THAT ANAKIN WASN'T JEDI ANYMORE IS IT THAT HARD TO PIECE TOGETHER
EASY ANSWER CLONES WERE ORDERED TO KILL JEDI MASTERS ANAKIN WAS NEVER A MASTER AND WHEN ORDER WAS EXECUTED ANAKIN WAS VADER
WATCH V
MORE GARBAGE MOBILE GAMES
YEAH LOOKS PRETTY LAME
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE HATE HERE I THINK IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD LIKE A GALAXY OF HEROES BUT BETTER
UPDATE WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK THIS WAY OR THE ORIGINAL
KLEENEX FOR WHINEY TIMES
IT'S BASICALLY JUST THIS IMAGE
NOPE THAT'S HIS SON WITH HIS WIFE LITTLE DEBBIE
HE'S GOT A COLD
IT'S A GOOD THING ACCORDING TO IADB IF YOU CAN TRUST THAT THAT ARIAN JOHNSON IS WRITING BOTH AND THEN
COLIN ALSO DIRECTED THE FANTASTIC SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED HONESTLY WITH THE GROUND WORK BEING LAID CURRENTLY HE'D HAVE TO ACTIVELY WORK AT SCREWING IT UP

ALSO JURASSIC WORLD WAS IN DEVELOPMENTAL HELL FOR OVER YEARS AND SPIELBERG HAND PICKED HIM TO CARRY ON THE FRANCHISE HE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO MAKE NOT ONLY ONE OF THE HIGHEST GROSSING MOVIES EVER BUT ALSO THE ONLY GOOD JURASSIC PARK SEQUEL SOMETHING SPIELBERG HIMSELF FAILED AT TREVORROW IS NOT A BAD DIRECTOR

HONESTLY I SEE HIM IN A SIMILAR LIGHT TO GARETH EDWARDS BOTH DIRECTED A GOOD MOVIE THEN DIRECTED A GIANT MONSTER MOVIE ONLY I'D ARGUE AT LEAST THE ACTORS IN JURASSIC WORLD HAD CHARISMA SOMETHING THAT THE ONES IN GODZILLA DIDN'T HAVE I LIKE EDWARDS AS A DIRECTOR AND ROGUE ONE LOOKS STUNNING BUT TREVORROW GETS SO MUCH MORE CRITICISM THAN HIM DESPITE PROVING HIMSELF MORE
JURASSIC WORLD WAS NOT BADLY DIRECTED IT WAS JUST A VERY CLICHE SCREEN PLAY THAT RELIED ON NOSTALGIA TO BRING PEOPLE TO THE THEATER
I THOUGHT JURASSIC WORLD WAS FUN
GO WATCH JURASSIC PARK AGAIN AND YOU'LL HAVE A NEW APPRECIATION FOR J I'VE HEARD A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE MOVIE AND OTHER THEN MY OWN PETTY COMPLAINTS LIKE GETTING A YEAR OLD JEEP TO RUN LIKE NEW WITH OLD GASOLINE THE MOVIE WAS EVERYTHING I'D WANT IN A JURASSIC SEQUEL
J WAS PRETTY COOL
THE PROBLEMS WITH JURASSIC WORLD WERE NOT FAULT HE CAME ONTO THE PROJECT SUPER LATE AND WAS GIVEN A VERY SHITTY SCREENPLAY TO WORK WITH INSTEAD OF THE I REX IT HAD HYBRIDS AS THE VILLAIN AND HE PERSONALLY HAD TO REWRITE LARGE PARTS OF IT SUPER QUICK TREVORROW IS THE ONLY REASON THE FILM IS AS GOOD AS IT IS
I FUCKING LOVED THAT MOVIE
EPISODE IN GOOD HANDS
YEAH I MEAN I THOUGHT JURASSIC WORLD WAS TERRIBLE AND I'M A BIT PERTURBED BY THEIR CHOICE BUT I HAVE FAITH IN EVERYONE INVOLVED TO TURN OUT A MOVIE AT LEAST AS GOOD AS FFA
LOOK AT JURASSIC WORLD AS A PARODY BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT WAS
ACTUALLY INHIBITOR CHIPS MAKE ORDER MORE HEARTBREAKING IF YOU WATCHED ACW YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP JEDI AND CLONES HAD IF YOU REMOVE THE INHIBITOR CHIP THAT RELATIONSHIP BECOMES MEANINGLESS BECAUSE THEY WERE NEVER FRIENDS WITH THE JEDI THEY WOULD JUST BE PRETENDING WHILE WITH THE INHIBITOR CHIP THEY ARE STILL FRIENDS WITH THE JEDI BUT THEY HAVE TO KILL THEM IMO INHIBITOR CHIPS MAKE ORDER AND CLONES BETTER
IT IS NOT REASONABLE TO ASSUME EVERY CLONE WOULD TURN ON THEIR JEDI LEADER THEY HAVE WORKED WITH FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS YOUR QUOTE IS NON CANON THAT WHOLE ANGLE WAS INTERESTING AT FIRST BUT ONCE THE CLONE WARS SHOW CAME OUT THE JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS REASON WASN'T BELIEVABLE ANY LONGER SINCE THEY SHOWED US THEY ALL HAD CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS
THE INHIBITOR CHIPS WITH WHAT WE NOW KNOW OF THE CLONE JEDI RELATIONSHIP IS THE BEST AND MOST BELIEVABLE OPTION
HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE CLONE TROOPERS BETRAYING THEIR JEDI FRIENDS WITHOUT QUESTION WITHOUT THE INHIBITOR CHIP
I ALSO LIKE THE IDEA OF ORDER BEING A CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR THE BETRAYAL OF THE JEDI BUT AND GRANTED THIS IS MY HEAD CANON I THINK WE CAN RECONCILE THE TWO IN STAR WARS WE SEE TWO CASES OF AN INHIBITOR CHIP IN ACTION THE FIRST IN IN THE CLONE WARS WHEN CHIP MALFUNCTIONS AND THE NEXT TIME WE SEE IT HAPPENS IS DURING ORDER THEY BOTH RESULT IN THE DEATH OF THE JEDI BUT THE MECHANISM IS DIFFERENT AS WE SEE IN REVENGE OF THE SITH PROPERLY FUNCTIONING CHIPS ENSURED COMPLIANCE BUT THE CLONES DIDN'T LOOSE RATIONAL THOUGHT AND BECOME POSSESSED SOME OF THEM OBEYED IMMEDIATELY BUT OTHERS MAINLY TROOPS ON MYGEETO AND ON FELECIA MAY HAVE WAITED UNTIL THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW THE ORDER WE NEVER SEE EITHER OF THESE TWO GROUPS RECEIVE THE COMMAND JUST EXECUTE IT WE ALSO KNOW THAT ORDER JUST A BLANKET ORDER SENT OUT TO ALL CLONES WE SEE PALATINE DELIVER INDIVIDUALIZED ORDERS TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT CLONES I BELIEVE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A KILL ALL JEDI CONTINGENCY PLAN ON THE BOOKS BUT EXECUTE ORDER SPECIFICALLY COMING FROM PALATINE MAY HAVE BEEN THE TRIGGER WORD TO ENSURE THE COMPLIANCE
I'VE GOT MIXED FEELINGS HONESTLY BUT IN THE END IT WORKS
I STILL LIKED KAREN BOOK SERIES BETTER ACW CHIPS WERE SILLY AS WAS MOST OF THAT SHOW
EVERYONE HATED IT WHEN IT FIRST CAME TO LIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE DEFENDING IT REMINDS ME OF THE PREQUEL STAR WARS FANS SEEM TO SLOWLY ADOPT BAD THINGS AND ACCEPT THEM OVER TIME
THE CAST OF A NEW HOPE WAS GENERALLY FULL OF UNKNOWNS THAT BEING SAID I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO PICK SOME NEW ACTORS IT WOULDN'T BE PROPER IF I KNEW THEM

MORE DAISY RIDLEYS AND JOHN BODEGAS
DANNY DEVITO AS YODA
DONALD GLOVER AS LANDO
LOL MODERN TIMES
MICHAEL FASSBENDER AS HAN SOLO
I LIKE TO THINK WE STILL WOULD HAVE GOTTEN CARRIE MARK AND HARRISON BUT YOU KNOW AS THEY ARE NOW
VADER AS THE MAIN ANTAGONIST THAT'S THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL TRILOGY

OR DO YOU MEAN AN ANTHOLOGY FILM ABOUT VADER
I'M NOT EXPECTING A TON OF SCREEN TIME BUT I'D BE WILLING TO BET WE'LL SEE VADER DO SOME SERIOUS VILLAINY THINGS IN ROGUE ONE PROBABLY SOME OF HIS WORST
A MOVIE WITH VADER AS THE MAIN CHARACTER WOULD BE AWESOME I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MOVIE THAT GOES MORE INADEPT WITH HIS THAUGHT AND EMOTIONS AND HIS STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE DARK AND THE LIGHT I FIND HIS CHARACTER REALLY FASCINATING BECAUSE I BELIEVE THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAN WHAT IS SHOWN IN THE MOVIES
WHAT MY HOPES HAVE BEEN REGARDING THE ANTHOLOGY FILMS A NICE VADER PIC
THERE IS AN YEAR HISTORY TO EXPLORE WHEN HE IS AT HIS MOST BADASS WHICH BEGS TO BE EXPLORED ON SCREEN
GRANTED THE MAINSTREAM AUDIENCE MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH ASOKA BUT TO FEATURE THOSE 2 IN A FINAL BATTLE WHERE ASOKA RECEIVES THE TREATMENT SHE DESERVES ON FILM AND THE END TO WRAP UP THEIR HISTORY COULD BE EPIC
I'D BE FINE WITH ANY FILM TOLD FROM THE EMPIRE'S PERSPECTIVE KIND OF LIKE LOST STARS
BOUT DAYS GIVE OR TAKE
FOR VADER TO BE THE MAIN ANTAGONIST HE'D HAVE TO BE GOING UP AGAINST SOMEONE WHOSE STORY HE'S TIED TO PERSONALLY THAT'S WHY HE'S THE BIG BAD OF THE OT IF LUKE WASN'T THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THOSE FILMS VADER WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH TO DO BEYOND BE A SCARY LOOKING HENCHMAN

THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD CONVINCINGLY BE THE PROTAGONIST OF THAT FILM IS ASOKA BUT THAT WON'T HAPPEN THE STUDIO WON'T RELEASE A FILM THAT BIG THAT HAS TWO SEPARATE TV SHOWS AS REQUIRED READING IN ORDER TO APPRECIATE THE FILM
SO YOU WANT STAR WARS
IF THEY DO IT IT HAS TO BE YEARS OR LESS JAMES EARL JONES IS SADLY NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER AND I WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY ONE ELSE TO VOICE DARTH VADER EXCEPT JE
WE'VE ALREADY HAD HIM AS THE MAIN BAD GUY FOR FILMS SO I DON'T THINK WE REALLY NEED TO SEE HIM IN THAT MAIN BAD GUY ROLE AGAIN I THINK HE'D WORK BETTER AS A SUPPORTING VILLAIN
LEGO VADER RATED R
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WILL EVER DO ONE
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE VADER BE A TOTAL BAD ASS IN THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY AND PREQUEL WE ARE NEVER REALLY TREATED SEE HIS FULL RAW POWER UNLEASHED

HE WOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY A NARRATIVE WELL TOO MAYBE A LITTLE STRUGGLE FROM HIM FEELING A PULL TO THE LIGHT
UH THE PREQUEL TRILOGY
THIS ACTUALLY NEVER OCCURRED TO ME AS YOU LAY IT OUT DISNEY WON'T LET VADER FADE FROM MEMORY BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY EXPECT TO SEE A FILM STARRING HIM FFA AND ROGUE ONE BOTH INCLUDE HIM IN A MINOR CAPACITY SO HE'S NOT GATHERING DUST YET

THE ONLY SORT OF FILM THAT I CAN IMAGINE HAPPENING SOON WOULD BE SOMETHING SET BETWEEN ANH AND ESB ABOUT HIS SEARCH FOR LUKE OR PERHAPS A SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE ADAPTION

OTHERWISE I THINK THAT THEY'LL KEEP MAKING FILMS BASED ON OTHER THINGS SOME OF WHICH INVOLVE JUST A BIT OF VADER I DO NOT EXPECT ANY FILMS ABOUT HIM IT'S SO EASY TO CREATE NEW VILLAINS THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO MILK THAT ONE TOO MUCH THEY CAN ALWAYS BRING HIM BACK IN THE FUTURE

A DARTH VADER FILM WOULD BE AMAZING SADLY I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING DISNEY WOULD GO FOR THIS

ALTHOUGH I COULD DEFINITELY SEE A DARTH VADER VIDEO GAME MUCH LIKE THE FORCE UNLEASHED
WHEN THEY REALIZE MY POTENTIAL AND CAST ME IN THE SUIT
THEY ANNOUNCED A VR FILM ABOUT DARTH VADER A WHILE BACK
YES SOMETHING ABOUT HIM TRACKING DOWN JEDI THAT SURVIVED ORDER MAKE IT LIKE A HORROR MOVIE WHERE VADER IS LIKE FREDDY JASON MIKE MYERS
I THINK THAT RETURN OF THE JEDI WRAPPED THAT UP NICELY BUT IF YOU ARE SPEAKING OF WHICH SHOULD BE THE LAST RELEASED I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE WITH THE ROGUE ONE CREW THE TRAILERS LOOK AMAZING AND I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW THE STORY OF THESE CHARACTERS IF ANY SURVIVE IN OTHER MOVIES
EVERYTHING I'D WANT WOULD BE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL CAST IS AGING
EPISODE LEIX
I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE BOUNTY HUNTERS FOR AS BADASS AS THE EU MAKES THEM THEY JUST LOOK COOL ON SCREEN

ROTC DEFINITELY TIED THE BOW NICELY HOWEVER
I GUESS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LAST MOVIE SHOULD WILL BE BUT I DO THINK THAT NEITHER THE HAN SOLO MOVIE NOR ROGUE ONE ARE GOING TO BE AS SINGULAR AS DISNEY SEEMS TO IMPLY THEY ARE

I GUESS I JUST DON'T THINK THEY'D TAKE THE RISK OF RECASTING HAN AND LANDO IF THEY HAD ZERO INTEREST IN IT GROWING BEYOND A ONE OFFICIAL

AND IF THE HAN SOLO MOVIE ISN'T A ONE OFF I DON'T THINK THEY'D LEAVE ROGUE ONE OUT TO DRY EITHER

I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF ALL THAT ARE AND I DON'T THINK DISNEY DOES EITHER TO A CERTAIN EXTENT

I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE A ROGUE ONE 2 OR A HAN SOLO 2 BUT THEY COULD DEFINITELY REUSE THOSE FAMILIAR AND NOW YOUNG FACES

OVERALL I THINK DISNEY IS PROBING WITH THESE FIRST MOVIES PROBING FOR THAT SWEET SPOT BETWEEN MAXIMIZING CASUAL VIEWER INTEREST MORE HAN SOLO AND NOT PISSING OFF THE CRAZY FANS BY OVERSTEPPING THEIR BOUNDARIES MORE HAN SOLO

BUT IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL FOR THEM I COULD DEFINITELY SEE THIS BECOMING A MARVEL STYLE HEY IT'S ME FROM THAT OTHER MOVIE THING

BUT WE'LL SEE WE'LL SEE
AS LONG AS THEY KEEP MAKING GOOD STORIES I DON'T CARE HOW MANY THEY MAKE IT'S A BIG GALAXY HOW MANY STORIES ABOUT WW2 CAN BE MADE
LAST RELEASED ID LIKE TO SEE EITHER AN OBI WAN ALA ZATOICHI
OR A FILM ABOUT THE LAST SURVIVING JEDI ESCAPING CORUSCANT
ITS THE REBOOT FILM SO THEY CAN GO BACK AND REMAKE EVERYTHING A LA DAYS OF FUTURE PAST IS IT NOT
I REALLY ENJOYED THIS ISSUE THE MOMENT WHERE LUKE LASHES OUT AT THE STORM-TROOPER AND VADER FELT IT DAMN

THE ENDING WITH THE CAPTURE OF C WAS MORE THAN A BIT LAME THOUGH I DON'T LIKE WHEN THINGS LIKE THAT GET CANONIZED ARE WE NOW SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT THE EMPIRE IS GOING TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN HACK THE MEMORY AND THEN MELT IT DOWN OR THAT HAN LEIA LUKE WOULD RISK THEIR LIVES AND THE FUTURE OF THE REBELLION TO RECOVER HIM

THAT BEING SAID I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO BASED ON THE TEASER PANEL IT APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER BUT MAYBE WITH A YODA APPEARANCE
FINALLY AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS READING I'M UP TO DATE WITH STAR WARS AND VADER HAHA

I LIKED THIS ONE BUT I'M A BIT TIRED OF THE THIS PLAN CAN WORK BECAUSE WE ARE CRAZY ONLY REBELS ARE THIS CRAZY ETC NO IF THE PLAN IS IMPOSSIBLE OR DOESN'T MAKE SENSE YOU SHOULD END UP DEAD COME ON

BUT I LOVE THE SCAR TEAM

NEXT ISSUES WILL BE SET BEFORE EPISODE I SO IN CANON THEY WILL BE THE VERY FIRST THING IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
THIS IS WHAT I PUT ON R STARWARSCANON

I REALLY HOPE THE SERIES PICKS BACK UP AFTER THIS CHAPTER I FOUND THE WHOLE THING TO BE REALLY FAR FETCHED EVEN FOR SCI-FI FANTASY STANDARDS STEALING A STAR DESTROYER IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW IN LOST STARS THIS CHAPTER IGNORING ALL OF THAT IRKS ME A BIT

SOME OF THE ACTION AND THE CHARACTERS WERE GOOD THOUGH I ENJOYED SOME OF FIGHTING I WISH THEY COULD HAVE HAD A MORE COMPELLING STORYLINE THOUGH WE DON'T NEED THE COMIC TO GO HUGE AND EPIC FOR IT TO BE COMPELLING
THE EDGE TROOPERS ENDED UP BEING EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE JUST CANNON FODDER WHO WERE DEFEATED BY PLOT ARMOR

AFTER THEIR MASSIVE BUILD UP I NEVER TRULY SAW THEM AS A THREAT IN THIS ARC WE'LL SEE WHERE THEY GO WITH THIS
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD ENDING TO AN OTHERWISE OK ARC LIKED HOW VADER CONDESCENDED BOTH LUKE AND AREEL ON THE LIGHTSABER ABILITIES THE ADVENTURE WAS WEIRD THOUGH I DUNNO IF I'M JUST NOT GETTING IT BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED BESIDES JUST BUMPING INTO THINGS TO GET TO THE
WELL I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER WITH IT WAS REALLY PUSHING MY SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF THEY TOOK OVER A WHOLE STAR DESTROYER TO SEND SOME SUPPLIES TO A PLANET THAT SEEMS MORE LIKE A PLOWLINE FROM REBELS NOT THE MAIN HEROES

BUT I LIKED SCAR FOR THE MOST PART AND I HOPE THE STORY IS ENTERTAINING IT HAS A TON OF POTENTIAL I HOPE VADER TALKS TO HIM

AND I'M PUMPED FOR YODA SHOULD BE GOOD PLUS WE GET A NEW ARTIST
FORD WAS PRETTY WELL KNOWN FROM AMERICAN GRAFFITI HAMILL HAD BEEN IN A FEW SHOWS I THINK ALWAYS PLAYING A BADDY BUT WASN'T KNOWN AND FISHER WAS ONLY REALLY KNOWN BECAUSE OF HER PARENTS I THINK
SAW THE SPELLING ERRORS SMILED NOT EVEN MAD NEW SQUEALS FOR EVERYONE
SQUEALS IS SO GOOD I'M NOT EVEN MAD ABOUT ANOTHER ROUGE
ANTHOLOGYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY LIKE THAT KIND OF SQUEAL ALSO I'M STILL A FIRM BELIEVER THAT ROUGE ONE WOULD BE A GOOD MOVIE OBI WAN GOES UNDER COVER IN A PARIS NIGHT CLUB AS A STRUGGLING WRITER AND ENDS UP FALLING IN LOVE IT'S THE OBI WAN SATINE BACKSTORY WE'VE ALL BEEN CLAMBERING FOR
SQUEEL
ENJOYED THAT THANKS EPISODE 2 WAS SORT OF GUILTY PLEASURE FOR ME I ENJOYED IT EVEN THOUGH I KNEW I SHOULDN'T IF ANYTHING IT'S MUCH MORE REWATCHABLE THAN EPISODE
PREQUEL HATERS ARE THE BIGGEST BUNCH OF MORONS ON PLANET EARTH IT WOULDN'T MATTER WHAT WAS MADE THEY WOULD LET THEM SELVES BE LET DOWN FOR EVERY DUMB THING THAT MADE NO SENSE IN ONE OF THE PREQUEL OR HAD BAD ACTING OR DIALOG YOU CAN FIND IN THE OT PEOPLE LIKE THE THE OT FOR NOSTALGIC REASONS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE A SUPERIOR PRODUCT IF THE OT WAS RELEASED TODAY UNCHANGED AND EVERYONE SAW IT FOR THE THE FIRST TIME THEY WOULD THINK IT WAS CRAP THE ACTING THE GRAPHICS THE STORY IS WHAT HAS ALWAYS MADE STAR WARS AND THE PREQUEL DELIVER ON THAT LEVEL
WTF
SAW THIS ON TV RANDOMLY YESTERDAY IT'S A GOOD ONE
NOT GONNA LIE THE MUSIC AND DIALOGUE FROM THIS ONE MADE ME A BIT EMOTIONAL
REBELS DIFFERS IN STYLE BUT I DO FIND BOTH ENJOYABLE REBELS MUCH LIKE ACW HAS DEFINITELY IMPROVED WAY BETTER OVER IT'S FIRST SEASON

EDIT LEFT OUT A WORD
I THINK THEY ARE GOING FOR A YOUNGER DEMO WITH REBELS
REBELS IS WAY TOO CHILDISH FOR ME I THINK THE ART HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT
ACW HAS SOME OF THE BEST MOMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY

REBELS IS GETTING GOOD THOUGH AND A JOY TO WATCH
I KNOW THIS ISN'T POPULAR OPINION BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO ACW I'VE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES I'M A HUGE STAR WARS FAN BUT TRY AS I MIGHT I'M JUST NEVER ENGAGED BY ACW

MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT CLONES WERE HANDLED ALL THAT WELL IN THE MOVIES AND THUS MY CARING ABOUT THEM DIDN'T REALLY TRANSFER TO THE SHOW OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED THAT I NEED TO WATCH LATER SEASON BUT I THINK I'VE SEEN MOST OF SEASON AND JUST WASN'T REALLY HOOKED

REBELS ON THE OTHER HAND I WATCH I DON'T THINK IT'S THE BEST PIECE OF STAR WARS LORE BUT I'VE BEEN OVERALL ENGAGED BY IT SO FAR
DELETED
IT'S FUNNY HOW LIVID THIS ANABASE IS OVER REBELS AFTER THE LAST 2 EPISODES EVEN THO EVERYONE WAS RAVING ABOUT IT SINCE THE SEASON PREMIERE UP UNTIL IMPERIAL SUPERCOMMANDOS
I MIGHT HAVE TO DISAGREE ABOUT THE SCORE IT'S SO MUCH MORE IN LINE WITH JOHN WILLIAMS IN REBELS GEORGE DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING SIMILAR TO JOHN WILLIAMS IN ACW SO HE TOLD KINER TO NOT REALLY DO ANY TRIBUTES WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS

ALSO IT'S THE SAME COMPOSER
NEVER FORGET CLONE WARS
AGREED I'VE WATCHED CLONE WARS THROUGH TWICE NOW GREAT SHOW REBELS IS DEFINITELY AIMED AT KIDS FIRST AND IT SHOWS
REBELS ANIMATION IS BETTER THAN ACW FOR ME
EVERYONE IN ACW IS BLOCKY AND COVERED IN WEIRD LINES
I AGREE COMPLETELY I DON'T MIND THAT REBELS HAS A MORE STRIPPED DOWN ANIMATED STYLE THAT'S THE COST OF NO LONGER HAVING LUCAS SHOVELING MONEY INTO THE SHOW I DO KIND OF MIND THAT I HAVE YET TO REALLY ENGAGE WITH ANY OF THE NEW CHARACTERS OUTSIDE OF MAYBE KANAN THE SAME WAY I DID WITH ASOKA AND REX WHEN CHARACTERS RETURNING FROM ACW REX ASOKA MAUL OR EVEN ANDO OR CHARACTERS APPEARING FROM LEGENDS THRAWN ARE THE MOST EXCITING ASPECTS OF THE SHOW THEN I THINK THEY'VE FAILED AT CREATING TRULY GREAT CHARACTERS

I STILL LIKE THE SHOW BUT IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO ACW I'VE REALLY TRIED TO STOP MAKING THE COMPARISONS THOUGH IT DOESN'T DO ME ANY GOOD TO CONSTANTLY WISH THE SHOW WAS SOMETHING THAT IT ISN'T
DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS FOR MOST OF ITS RUN ACW WAS JUST THE TV SHOW WITH ABOUT AS VAGUE A TARGET AUDIENCE AS THAT IMPLIES BUT REBELS WHICH WAS COMMISSIONED AFTER THE DISNEY ACQUISITION WAS DESIGNED FROM THE GROUND UP TO BE THE KID'S SHOW

ALSO IT'S ITS ANIMATION ITS SCORE ETC WHEN ITS INDICATES POSSESSION RATHER THAN A CONTRACTION OF IT IS THERE'S NO APOSTROPHE BECAUSE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS ARBITRARY LIKE THAT
I THINK SMALL STORY ARCS WERE A SUCCESSFUL STORYTELLING DEVICE THAT WORKED WONDERS FOR THE PACING OF THE SHOW WE GOT EPISODES IN AN ARC THAT TOLD A FULL STORY AND THEN THE NEXT ARC HAD THE FREEDOM TO JUMP TO ANOTHER CHARACTER OR ANOTHER PART OF THE GALAXY WITHOUT IT FEELING TOO JARRING

REBELS STORY FEELS LESS ENGAGING OVERALL BECAUSE EPISODE BY EPISODE NOT TOO MUCH CHANGES SURE THE OVERALL STORY PROGRESSES A LITTLE BUT OVERALL IT'S JUST ANOTHER MISSION ANOTHER RESCUE OPERATION ANOTHER SALVAGE TASK TO BUILD UP THE FLEET OR ANOTHER RUN-IN WITH BOUNTY HUNTERS OR THE EMPIRE IT'S NOT UNTIL WE GET TO THE SEASON FINALES THAT THE SHOW MAKES HUGE LEAPS IN THE STORY AND NOT UNTIL THE SEASON PREMIERE THAT WE SEE HOW MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE INTERIM THE TIME IN BETWEEN THERE IS TYPICALLY LACKLUSTER

ALL OF THAT BEING SAID I REALLY DO LOVE REBELS I JUST WISH IT WAS CONSISTENTLY STRONG THE FINALES AND THE PREMIERES OF EACH SEASON HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ALMOST TOPPING ANYTHING THAT PUT OUT BUT I FEEL THAT EPISODE BY EPISODE ACW TOLD BETTER STORIES HAD BETTER ACTION AND WAS MORE ENGAGING OVERALL
TO ME IT'S THE OPPOSITE ACW WAS AN AMBITIOUS SHOW PROBABLY A MORE CREATIVE SHOW BUT IT'S BY ALL ACCOUNTS A WORSE TELEVISION SHOW REBELS HAS DISTINCT CHARACTER ARCS BETTER PERFORMANCES DIALOGUE IT'S PACED BETTER THE CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS FEEL MORE PALPABLE AND REAL

ACW DID A LOT FOR STAR WARS MYTHOLOGY BUT THE CHARACTER GROWTH WAS INHERENTLY LIMITED DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT STARRED EXISTING CHARACTERS AND TOOK PLACE BETWEEN TWO MOVIES THE CHARACTERS OF ARCS END IN ROTS REBELS TAKES PLACE BETWEEN TWO FILMS BUT ITS CHARACTERS ARE SELF-CONTAINED AND THEIR ARC WILL EXIST ENTIRELY WITHIN THE SHOW ITSELF
DELETED
I'M JUST SORT OF MYSTIFIED THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTO THESE SHOWS TO ME THEY ARE MODERATELY OKAY KIDS SHOWS WITH A WHOLE LOT OF PRETTY MEDIOCRE CONTENTION ACW HAD SOME COOL VISUALS FOR AN ANIMATED PROGRAM BUT TO ME THEY DON'T COME CLOSE TO CAPTURING THE MAGIC OF THE MOVIES
IS ACW SERIES BETTER TO WATCH IS AIRED ORDER OR CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
I FOUND IT TO BE THE OPPOSITE WHILE I DID ENJOY BCWS A LOT OF ITS STYLE PARTICULARLY THE MUSIC DIDN'T FEEL TRUE TO STAR WARS REBELS FEELS MORE LIKE THE OT THAN FEELS LIKE THE PART BCWS DEFINITELY MADE THE PT A BIT MORE ENJOYABLE TO WATCH THOUGH BY REALLY FLESHING OUT ANI AND OBI MORE THAN THE MOVIES EVER DID AMONG OTHER CHARACTERS BUT IT TOOK A WHILE TO REALLY BUILD UP IT'S QUALITY WHERE AS I FOUND REBELS FOUND ITS FOOTING MUCH QUICKER
REBELS IS BETTER IMO
CLONE WARS AS A WHOLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER SHOW OVERALL BUT COMPARING THE FIRST TWO SEASONS OF BOTH REBELS IS FAR BETTER RIGHT NOW HANDS DOWN
REBELS HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE TO BE A PART OF STAR WARS

SORRY THE SERIES IS JUST A MESS
CHOPPER

AND THAT'S ALL I GOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT
I NEVER QUITE KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM WHEN THEY BASH REBELS ANIMATION BUT PRAISE ACW

I'D ARGUE THAT BOTH FEATURE PRETTY AWKWARD POOR CHARACTER ANIMATION BUT REBELS IS A MUCH BETTER LOOKING SHOW TO ME ACW IS MAYBE MORE DETAILED LESS OBVIOUSLY RESTRAINED BY BUDGET BUT IT'S UGLY IT LOOKS LIKE A CUTSCENE VERSION OF THE PREQUEL REBELS ON THE OTHER HAND PRESUMABLY AS A RESULT OF THE MCQUARRIE INFLUENCE HAS THAT TIMELESS STAR WARS QUALITY THE DESIGNS AND BACKGROUNDS ARE ON POINT CHEAP TV ANIMATION ASIDE IT'S STUNNING MY ONLY GRIPE IS THOSE SKINNY LIGHTSABERS
WRONG ITS ALL THREE TIMES
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO ABSOLUTELY HATES THE ANIMATION AND STORY ARCS OF THE CGI CRAP WHAT THEY DECIDED TO MAKE CANON IS APPALLING
I AM FUCKING DONE WITH REBELS IT'S FOR FRIGGED TODDLERS UNLIKE THE CLONE WARS NO ONE SHOULD BE WATCHING THIS SHITTY WATERED DOWN SHOW THAT FAILS MISERABLY AT BEING A PART OF THIS GREAT LEGACY
THE CARTOON IS FUN BUT IT IS IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM A REALISTIC DEPICTION OF JEDI OR OTHERWISE ABILITIES

BECAUSE THE CARTOON WAS NEVER A REALISTIC DEPICTION OF THEIR POWERS IT DIDN'T LINE UP WITH ANYTHING ELSE EVER PUBLISHED

PERSONALLY EVEN BEFORE IT WAS OFFICIALLY DECLARED LEGENDS I HEADCANONED IT AS REPUBLIC PROPAGANDA
WELL CARTOON TOOK A LOT OF LIBERTIES IN TERMS OF DEPICTING JEDI POWERS AND GENERAL BADASSERY LIKE WHEN HINDU DESTROYED AN ENTIRE ARMY OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS AND A HUGE TERRAFORMING WEAPON BY HIMSELF AND HALF OF IT WITHOUT A LIGHTSABER AMAZING DEFINITELY REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF WHAT JEDI CAN ACHIEVE IN THE MOVIES DEFINITELY NOT


BECAUSE THOSE WERE JEDI WITH WAYS OF THINKING AT THAT TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY UNTHINKABLE TO USE THE FORCE IN SUCH AN AGGRESSIVE MANNER THE WAR FORCED THEM TO DO SO IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AND TO SAVE OTHERS

NOT TO MENTION THAT THE JEDI HAD VERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN COMBAT WHERE THEY WERE MASSIVELY OUTNUMBERED AT THAT POINT
INEXPERIENCE MOST OF THEM HAVE NEVER BEEN IN COMBAT BEFORE THEY WERE MORE LIKE AMBASSADORS WARS THAN SOLDIERS
I MEAN THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF DROIDS
BECAUSE THEY RECEIVED FATAL WOUNDS CAUSING THEM TO STOP BREATHING THEIR HEARTS TO STOP AND BRAIN FUNCTION TO CEASE
EPISODES
LOOKS LIKE IT'S A POSTER
WORTH THE EXTRA
NICE HOPE YOU ENJOY REBELS TOO
MUCH LIKE ACW IT STARTS A BIT SLOW AND GETS BETTER AS IT GOES ON BUT OF REBELS IS CERTAINLY MUCH BETTER THAN OF ACW


I'M JUST GONNA QUICKLY COMMENT ON ONE OF YOUR POINTS THE MAGIC STUFF
ALL THE MAGIC SHOWN IN ACW IS STILL THE FORCE ITS JUST BEING USED DIFFERENTLY THE FOR EXAMPLE ARE WHO HAVE LEARNED TO USE THE FORCE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE JEDI SITH SO THEIR METHOD OF USING IT IS DIFFERENT TOO
SO DONT WORRY THE FORCE IS STILL THE ONLY SUPERNATURAL POWER IN THE UNIVERSE

I REMEMBER YOU GLAD YOU ENJOYED THE SERIES

YOU SHOULD NOW CONSIDER BESIDES OBVIOUSLY WATCHING REBELS READING THE NOVELS ASOKA AND DARK DISCIPLE WHICH GO ALONG WITH ACW

WHEN I FIRST STARTED WATCHING I NEVER WOULD HAVE BELIEVED I'D CARE ABOUT CLONE TROOPERS AND THEN IT'S VERY QUICKLY OH MY GOD I LOVE THEM ALL THE FEELINGS THEY MADE ME FEEL ARGH

I WISH WE COULD HAVE SEEN MORE OF CUT SUU AND THEIR FAMILY CUT GETS A VERY BRIEF AND INCONSEQUENTIAL SHOUT OUT IN THE AFTERMATH NOVEL WHICH PLEASED ME GREATLY JUST BECAUSE I'M SUCH A FAN THAT I'LL TAKE ANYTHING HAHA
GENERAL GRIEVOUS WILL RUN AND HIDE AS HE ALWAYS DOES HINDU REVENGE OF THE SITH
NOW GO WATCH REBELS WHICH IS LIKE A MILLION TIMES BETTER
DID YOU WATCH THE LOST MISSIONS SEASON I THINK THAT IT ISN'T IN THE BOSSET AND UTAPAU AND BAD BATCH STORY REELS


ALSO THERE IS ALSO A DARTH MAUL COMIC SON OF DATHOMIR ASSAY VENTRESS BOOK DARK DISCIPLE AND YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE ASOKA BOOK THEY CONTINUE ACW STORY WHICH WAS SADLY NOT FINISHED


EDIT MISSIONS NOT EPISODES
I ONLY TEND TO WATCH THEM ABOUT ONCE A YEAR DESPITE BEING A HUGE FAN IT KEEPS THEM SPECIAL AND IT FEELS LIKE A WONDROUS NEW EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME THEY COME ON
EVERY ONCE AND AWHILE I SIMPLY DON'T HAVE TO TIME TO MARATHON THEM MUCH THESE DAYS
I USUALLY WATCH THEM ONCE A YEAR BUT I HAVEN'T WATCH ANY THIS YEAR MINUS THE FORCE AWAKENS SINCE I WATCHED ALL SIX MOVIES NOW SEVEN TWICE LAST YEAR WHEN THE CHEWIE WE'RE HOME TEASER CAME OUT IN APRIL IT GAVE ME A HUGE STAR WARS FEVER THAT MADE ME RECATCH ALL SIX THEN IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR I REMATCHED THEM ALL AGAIN LEADING UP TO THE FORCE AWAKENS GIVEN THAT I THINK I PROBABLY WILL SKIP IT THIS YEAR BUT I AM FOR SURE GONNA RECATCH A NEW HOPE AFTER ROGUE ONE
I TEND TO WATCH ONE OF THE FILMS EVERY WEEKS OR SO I NOTICE SOMETHING NEW EVERY TIME IT FEELS LIKE I ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF WATCHING I HAVE MY FOCUSED WATCHING LIKE I'M DOING THIS WEEK BUT I HAVE TIMES WHERE I TO WATCH THEM WITH WOOKIEEPEDIA OPEN AND RESEARCH LITTLE THROWAWAY COMMENTS TO LEARN MORE LORE
BARELY BECAUSE I REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THEM WHICH SORT OF RUIN IT
I SOMETIMES GET AN URGE TO WATCH A SPECIFIC ONE OF THEM BUT I NEVER MARATHON THEM
I RECENTLY REMATCHED ROTS THOUGH
I TYPICALLY WATCH ALL OF THEM TWICE A YEAR ONCE IN THE SUMMER AND ONCE DURING CHRISTMAS BREAK RECENTLY I HAVE BEEN REWATCHING ACW AND I THINK I'LL START DOING THAT EVERY 2 YEARS OR SO
I WATCH EPISODES USUALLY ONCE A YEAR NOW AND WILL THROW EP INTO THE MIX
MY YOUNGEST IS NOW SO WE JUST WATCHED 2 AND I HADN'T SEEN THEM SINCE THE THEATER AND I REMEMBER WHY WON'T BE WATCHING THEM AGAIN ANYTIME SOON LAST YEAR I TRIED TO WATCH EP WITH HER AND SHE GOT BORED AFTER MINUTES

NOW WHEN I WAS YOUNGER PRE TEEN MY FRIEND AND I WATCHED THEM WEEKLY EVEN AS A TEENAGER IT WAS PROBABLY ONCE A MONTH NOW IT'S ANNUAL ALONG WITH LOAR TRILOGY
I WATCH THEM EXTREMELY OFTEN THEY NEVER GET OLD TO ME I'VE PROBABLY SEEN EACH EPISODE ABOUT TIMES SOME MORE SO THAN OTHERS OVER THE PAST YEAR
AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR

AS A SAGA I'LL WATCH THEM ALL AT LEAST ONCE BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE AN URGE TO WATCH JUST THE ORIGINALS AND NOW EPISODE VII SO THOSE MOVIES I MIGHT WATCH TWICE A YEAR

MAY THE 4TH WILL BE GREAT FOR THE MOVIES I ALWAYS WANT TO WATCH A SW MOVIE ON THAT DAY BUT NEVER DO BECAUSE I ALWAYS LIKE TO WATCH THEM ALL CONSECUTIVELY MOVIES WILL MAKE THIS MUCH EASIER


I LIKE TO RECATCH A NEW HOPE IF I'VE HAD A PRETTY BAD DAY IN ORDER TO CHEER MYSELF UP THE LAST TIME I DID THAT WAS NOVEMBER 8TH
I'D SAY I WATCH A SINGLE MOVIE EVERY WEEK OR TWO
I USED TO WATCH THEM 2 OR TIMES A WEEK THESE DAYS IT'S DROPPED TO EVERY MONTH OR TWO
I TEND TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR THOUGH I DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF SET IN STONE SCHEDULE FOR IT I'M NOT A FAN OF THE PREQUEL BUT I DID WATCH ALL FILMS BEFORE THE FORCE AWAKENS IT SEEMED LIKE THE THING TO DO AND I HADN'T SEEN THEM IN YEARS AND WANTED TO SEE HOW I'D VIEW THEM NOW I HAVE SEEN FFA ABOUT TIMES SINCE ITS RELEASE THOUGH

I TAKE IN SO MUCH STAR WARS MEDIA OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR AS WELL AS OTHER MOVIES SO IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE I'M GOING WITHOUT BY NOT WATCHING THE FILMS EVERY MONTH OR SOMETHING
I'VE SEEN THE PREQUEL TWICE ONCE WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED AND AGAIN BEFORE VII

I WATCHED THE OT A LOT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND THE ONLY ACCESS TO STAR WARS I HAD WERE THE VHS TAPES AND THE THE COLLECTABLE CARD GAME
I DID WATCH THEM BEFORE VII BUT THAT WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS OR MORE

I WENT TO SEE VII TWICE IN THEATRES IN THE FIRST MONTH BUT HAVEN'T WATCHED IT SINCE

I'LL LIKELY REVISIT THEM IF MY DAUGHTER EXPRESSES ANY INTEREST WHEN SHE'S OLDER BUT THAT'S PROBABLY OR YEARS OFFICIAL
A FEW TIMES A YEAR WILL PROBABLY GET THE SAME VIEWINGS MAYBE ONCE EVERY COUPLE YEARS WATCHED AND PART OF LAST SUNDAY TRIED TO WATCH 2 A MONTH OR SO BACK BUT COULDN'T STOMACH IT MIGHT GET INTO A YEARLY ROTATION BUT AND 2 WILL BE RARITIES
MAYBE ONCE A YEAR OR SO HONESTLY I READ THE BOOKS AND COMICS MORE OFTEN AND THIS IS WEIRD BUT WHEN PEOPLE MENTION STAR WARS I AUTOMATICALLY THINK OF THE BOOKS BEFORE THE MOVIES AND YES TO ME LEGENDS IS STILL WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE MOVIES
AT LEAST TIMES A YEAR PROBABLY FOR I LOTS MORE LATELY THOUGH BECAUSE OF HYPE LOL
HAVEN'T WATCHED THE OT IN A COUPLE YEARS BUT HAVE SEEN THEM SO MANY TIMES

WATCHED THE PT ABOUT THREE TIMES NEVER AGAIN
THAT'S IT

THAT'S WORTH AN ARTICLE A HELMET GEORGE REMARKED WAS COOL IN PASSING MIGHT END UP IN THE BACKGROUND OF A SHOT IN ROGUE ONE

FUCKING HELL
NUMBER NO IT WOULDN'T
NUMBER

THAT ONLINE PETITION CALLING FOR GEORGE TO TAKE OVER AND DIRECT THE NEW MOVIES WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT
FUCK NUMBER ABSOLUTELY NOT

ANYONE WHO EVEN ENTERTAINS THE IDEA IS FREE TO WATCH RED TAILS
I THINK LUCAS IS A LOUSY WRITER AND A BAD DIRECTOR HE'S A DECENT ENOUGH AND WORLD BUILDER BUT I DON'T THINK HE HAS A MIND FOR STORYTELLING

IT WOULD BE DISAPPOINTING TO SEE HIS RETURN
I THINK GEORGE COULD COME BACK BUT TO BE A PART OF THE LUCASFILM STORY GROUP
I THINK LUCAS DESERVES A SAY IN HIS FUTURE BUT IT SHOULD BE AS IT WAS ON THE BEST OF THE OT OTHER PEOPLE DIRECTING LUCAS IS A WORLD BUILDER HIS IDEAS ARE BY AND LARGE GREAT AND BOLD FOR BETTER OR WORSE YES THE ACTING STYLE AND DIALOG OF THE PREQUEL WASN'T GOOD BUT THE WORLD WAS IT WAS RICH AND ALIVE WITH WEIRD IDEAS LUCAS MIGHT NOT BE AT THE HELM BUT I'D BE DAMNED HAPPY TO SEE HIM AS A CONSULTANT AS A CONCEPT ARTIST MYSELF I WOULD GIVE MY LEFT ARM FIGURATIVELY FOR A CHANCE TO WORK WITH GEORGE LUCAS BRILLIANT IMAGINATION

EDIT WELL EXPLAINED OPINION DOWNVOTES WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR DIFFERENT WORDS R STARWARD
ALSO
ITT POST LUCAS HATE
NO
NOT SURPRISED THIS WAS SHOT DOWN IN THIS SUB
I DON'T MIND HIM BEING AN AMBASSADOR FOR THE BRAND AS FOR BEING INVOLVED HANDS ON GOD NUMBER HE WAS THE ONE WHO DECIDED TO SELL NO ONE WAS HOLDING A GUN TO HIS HEAD FORCING HIM TO SELL HE MADE THAT DECISION THEREFORE HE SHOULD REALLY HAVE NO INVOLVEMENT WITH THE PROCESS ANYMORE AND SHOULD JUST BE HAPPY THAT THEY STILL HUMOR HIM WHEN I HEARD THAT THEY COMPLETELY DISREGARDED HIS TREATMENTS FOR THE NEW TRILOGY I WAS FILLED WITH JOY HE WAS POMPOUS ENOUGH TO THINK THAT HE COULD SELL ALL RIGHTS TO STAR WARS AND STILL BE THE OVERSEER IT'S MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE OF HOW OUT OF TOUCH HE'S TRULY BECOME
DIRECTER LUCAS ABSOLUT NO THE MAN CANT SEE CRITICALLY ON HIS OWN WORK

LUCAS WHO IS ONLY A IDEA SPRAYER AND THE PERSON WHO WRITE A EARLY DRAFT OF THE MANUS AND THEN OTHER PELPEL TAKE THE IDEAS AND MANUS AND MAKE A MOVIE OUT OF IT YES


THIS IS WHAT I SAID IN R STARWARSCANON

I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED BUT IT WAS PRETTY EXCITING

I REALLY ENJOYED THIS RUN IT WAS VERY FUN THE PACING WAS REALLY QUICK THOUGH I FELT LIKE THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD NOVEL OR MAYBE EVEN A VIDEO GAME
THE LAST PAGE TOO MANY FEELINGS ABORT ABORT

I REALLY REALLY ENJOYED THIS SERIES THE HAN CHARACTERIZATION AND GROWTH FELT RIGHT TO ME THE ART WAS SO FREAKING BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT AND IT HAD SOME GREAT CHARACTERS LOO RE ANNO AND DIRAE ESPECIALLY
I GOTTA LOVE A CANON DEMONSTRATION OF THE FALCON BEING THE FASTEST SHIP IN THIS RACE AMONGST THE FASTEST OF SHIP HAN AND CHEWIE REALLY DO HAVE THAT PIECE OF JUNK LIGHT FREIGHTER TRICKED OUT TO THE NTH DEGREE WHEN THEY CAN KEEP IT RUNNING
I REALLY DISLIKED THIS ISSUE THE KILLER WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE BEGINNING THE ENDING OF THE RACE SEEMED MORE LIKE DOCTOR WHO THAN STAR WARS I WAS REALLY LET DOWN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A BETTER ENDING
WAIT SO EVEN ON THE BLURRY YOU DON'T SEE CHEWBACCA RIP ARM OFF BECAUSE IF SO THAT IS SOME BULLETIN
LEIA IS A PRINCESS BECAUSE OF HER ADOPTIVE PARENTS THOUGH NOT BECAUSE HER BIRTH MOTHER WAS A QUEEN
LOVE FOR FADME IS A CENTRAL PLOT POINT TO THE MOVIE HE LITERALLY LOVES HER FROM CHILDHOOD TO DEATH ALSO PHYSICAL ATTACHMENTS ARE FORBIDDEN FOR CEDIS SO JUST THE ONE LOVE IS TABOO NEVERMIND HIM BEING A SPACE GIGOLO YOU WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETELY REWORK THE CHARACTER AND THE PLOT OF MOST OF THE FRANCHISE YOU COULD WORK SOMETHING LIKE THAT INTO HAN SOLO AND THE NEWEST FRANCHISE BUT NO IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE CHARACTER THE JEDI THE PLOT YOU COULDN'T MAKE THAT LEIA AND LUKE BE FROM DIFFERENT MOMS
EH I'M NOT REALLY FEELING IT I LIKE THE ORIGIN AS IT STANDS NOW BETTER
WHY WOULD FALCONS NOT EXIST THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY BIRDS WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A FALCON TO EXIST
THERE ARE DUCKS IN STAR WARS SO THERE'S PROBABLY FALCONS AND SLAVE SOUNDS INTIMIDATING YOU DON'T HAVE TO NAME YOUR SHIP AFTER YOUR PROFESSION
BEAR IN MIND THAT FALCON IS AN ARBITRARY NAME GIVEN TO AN ANIMAL THERE IS REALLY NO REASON WHY THERE COULDN'T BE SOMETHING IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE THAT BEARS THE SAME MONIKER

AS FAR AS SLAVE WHO'S TO SAY ANGO OR BOBA DIDN'T TRAFFIC SLAVES ALL THE OLD EU CANON IS GONE NOW THEY COULD HAVE BEEN HARDCORE SHIPPING OFF OF RYLOTH FOR ALL WE KNOW NOW
WHY ARE THEY CALLED STAR DESTROYERS WHEN THEY DON'T DESTROY STARS WHY ASK CONDESCENDING QUESTIONS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ANSWERED WITH A MODICUM OF CRITICAL THOUGHT
AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID THIS IS A SORT OF SILLY RHETORICAL QUESTION EASILY ANSWERED BY ASSUMING THE WORDS IN BASIC REPRESENT SOMETHING CLOSE TO A FALCON AND HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED FOR OUR BENEFIT BUT SINCE YOU TOOK THE TIME TO ASK AND THIS IS A FORUM FOR FAN DISCUSSION HOW ABOUT THIS

WE MIGHT ASSUME THAT LANDO NAMED THE FALCON AND HE'S INFATUATED WITH CHANCE AND LUCK HIS REPLACEMENT FOR THE FALCON IS NAMED LADY LUCK AFTER ALL LET'S SAY OLD LANDO HEARS A TALL TALE IN A CASINO FROM A CRANKY OLD PILOT OVER A GAME OF HABACUC THAT GOES LIKE THIS

A LONE MAN WANDERS ACROSS A DESERT WORLD MAROONED AND DESPERATE FOR WATER STUMBLING TOWARDS A BUSH THAT HE THINKS MUST BE GROWING OFF OF SOMETHING HE ACCIDENTALLY PUTS HIS FOOT DOWN IN THE HOME OF A DEADLY SERPENT THE SERPENT BARES ITS FANGS COILS TO STRIKE

AND IN A FLASH OF WHITE AND RED IS RIPPED FROM THE GROUND BY A THUNDEROUS FALCON WHO CARRIES ITS PREY OFF INTO THE DISTANCE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS SNAKES LIKE THAT ONE HAD STRUCK THEIR VICTIMS LIKE CLOCKWORK BUT OVER THE COURSE OF A THOUSAND YEARS LUCK CAN ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST ANYTHING IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME

THE STORY STRUCK LANDO THOUGH IT FAILED TO DISTRACT HIM FROM THE GAME AS THE OLD SPACER HAD HOPED IT MIGHT AND HE NAMED HIS SHIP AFTER AN UNLIKELY SAVIOR WHO IS THERE WHEN YOU NEED HER THE MILLENNIUM FALCON
I ASSUME THAT THERE IS A CREATURE CALLED A SOMETHING FALCON SIMILAR TO HOW IN REBELS THERE IS A LOTH CAT EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NO CATS IN STAR WARS
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT SOURCE

EDIT THANKS
PEOPLE KEEP SUBMITTING THIS BUT THE FILM WAS ALREADY DESCRIBED AS A WESTERN HEIST FILM WHEN IT WAS FIRST ANNOUNCED
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE REALLY EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE

ALSO WOULDN'T HAN SOLO IMITATING MAL REYNOLDS WHO WAS BASICALLY IMITATING HAN SOLO MEAN THAT HAN SOLO IS JUST BEING HAN SOLO

AND FIREFLY AS MUCH AS I LOVE IT IS FAR FROM THE FIRST STORY TO COMBINE ELEMENTS OF SCI-FI AND WESTERNS THERE ARE EVEN A LOT OF ELEMENTS OF THE OLD WESTERN GENRE PRESENT IN THE OT PROBABLY BECAUSE BOTH WESTERNS STAR WARS BORROWED A LOT OF IDEAS FROM JAPANESE CINEMA
IM FREAKING PUMPED FOR THIS MOVIE YEAH YOU CAN'T REPLACE HARRISON FORD AND ALL AND MAYBE I WOULD HAVE RATHER SEEN A KOROR OR SPINOFF BUT STILL I THINK THIS MOVIES HAS A LOT MORE GOING FOR IT CAST DIRECTORS WRITERS THAN IS HAS GOING AGAINST IT

I'M JUST IMAGINING HAN LANDO AND MAYBE CHEWIE DEPENDING IF HAN AND HIM HAVE MET YET JUST SCREWING AROUND CRACKING JOKES AND GETTING INTO ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE ALL WHILE PISSING OFF THE EMPIRE
IF THIS IS THE CASE I REALLY HOPE THEY GET CAD BANE IN THERE HE'S BASICALLY ANGEL EYES FROM THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY SO HE'D FIT PERFECTLY IN A WESTERN TYPE FILM
DIDN'T TIMOTHY ZAHN ALREADY DO THIS IN SCOUNDRELS THOUGH
WE VE TALKED ABOUT FREDERIC REMINGTON AND THOSE PRIMARY COLORS THAT ARE USED IN HIS PAINTINGS DEFINING THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE FILM KATHLEEN KENNEDY

THIS COMBINED WITH BRADFORD CINEMATOGRAPHY SOUNDS GORGEOUS BETWEEN HIM AND GREIG FRASER THE SPINOFFS ARE GETTING SOME REALLY TALENTED DPS SO FAR I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOUNG DOES WITH THE AESTHETIC KENNEDY IS DESCRIBING

SOME OF HIS WORK FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH HIM

AIN'T THEM BODIES SAINTS

A MOST VIOLENT YEAR THERE'S ALSO A CINEMATOGRAPHY FEATURETTE HERE

SELMA

ARRIVAL PROBABLY MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF THE YEAR AT LEAST UNTIL ROGUE ONE COMES OUT
I HOPE WE GET A BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID VIBE OUT OF THIS MOVIE
BUT I THOUGHT STAR WARS WAS ALREADY A SPACE WESTERN
AS MUCH AS I WISH THEY WOULD LET THIS CHARACTER TO REST SINCE HIS STORY ENDED I CAN'T HELP BUT BE EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE

I STILL WANT A OBI WAN KENOBI MOVIE THO
WOULD THAT IT TWERE SO SIMPLE
IT'LL BE WEIRD HAVING HAN SOLO IMITATE MAL REYNOLDS

WELL HE WON'T BE SO THERE THAT
SHINY
THAT'S COOL I'VE BEEN MISSING THIS SIDE OF THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE SINCE THE PREQUEL I WANT LESS FEWER JEDI AND MORE GANGSTERS AND GUNSLINGERS
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC
WESTERN HEIST FILM

CALLING IT EMILIA CLARKE IS GOING ACQUIRE THE AID OF HAN AND LANDO TO PULL A JOB THERE'LL BE A LIGHT-HEARTED LOVE TRIANGLE AS SHE PLAYS THEM BOTH ONLY TO REVEAL HER IDENTITY IS FALSE IN THE THIRD ACT REVEALING HERSELF AS A OPERATIVE FOR THE BLACK SUN NAMED BURI

HEY IF THEY CAN BRING THRAWN INTO CANON I DON'T SEE WHY THEY CAN'T BRING OTHER STORIES AND CHARACTERS INTO THE FOLD
WILL THERE BE A DEATH STAR OR SOMETHING LIKE IT
I HOPE ITS LIKE FIREFLY MINUS THE CANCELLING OF COURSE

I READ THE TITLE THEN INSTINCTIVELY WROTE COMMENT WITHOUT HAVING READ COMMENT BEFORE REALIZING I WAS SAYING WHAT OP SAID
PLEASE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS HAVE NATHAN BILLON PLAY ANOTHER SMUGGLER
THIS SOUNDS AWESOME SERIOUSLY AWESOME
EH THAT SEEMS COOL ENOUGH WONDER WHAT THEY'RE STEALING
THIS WAS ALREADY POSTED ONCE WITH A DIFFERENT LINK AND THEN DELETED WEIRD
IF YOU SAY SO
SOUNDS A LOT LIKE THE HUTT GAMBIT BOOK
SORT OF STYLE
THE OF STAR WARS MOVIES I MUST ADMIT THAT AT FIRST I WASN'T SOLD ON THE IDEA OF A MOVIE FOCUSED ON ONE CHARACTER BUT SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT EACH STAR WARS STORY BEING A DIFFERENT GENRE AND I LIKE THAT IDEA
SHOWDOWN AT THE OK CORRAL MOS BISLEY CANTINA
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME
HE'S GOING TO DUMP HIS CARGO AT THE FIRST SIGN OF AN IMPERIAL CRUISER
GREAT THEY'RE GOING TO STEAL THE PLANS TO THE DEATH STAR TOO
EPISTLE AND VADER HAVEN'T DUELED IN A LONG TIME AND BOTH ARE LONG PAST THEIR PRIME

EPISTLE LUKE HAS MINIMAL TRAINING AND VADER IS JUST TOYING WITH HIM

EPISTLE NEITHER ONE REALLY WANTS TO KILL THE OTHER AND ARE HOLDING BACK UNTIL THE VERY END
BECAUSE IN THE PREQUEL JEDI HAD MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS TO STUDY AND REFINE SABER COMBAT

BY TIME OF THE PREQUEL NO ONE WAS REALLY AROUND WHO COULD TEACH TO USE A SABER IN THAT WAY
REASON THE JEDI IN THE PREQUEL ALL MASTERED ONE OF THE LIGHTSABER FORMS IN THE OT FORMAL JEDI TRAINING IS PRETTY MUCH GONE SO LUKE NEVER LEARNED A PROPER LIGHTSABER FORM AS FAR AS WE KNOW

REAL REASON THE DUELS IN THE OT ARE SLOW BECAUSE THEY HAVENT THOUGHT ABOUT LIGHTSABER FORMS DURING THE FILMING OF THE OT
THIS ISN'T BUT IT'S STILL INFORMATIVE THE BIRTH OF THE LIGHTSABER
YE
CANONICALLY THAT'S HOW SKILLED JEDI FIGHT

PEOPLE ALSO SEEM TO USE THE FASTEST OF THE PREQUEL AND SLOWEST OF THE OT AND GENERALIZE BASED ON THOSE EXTREMES FOR EXAMPLE THE VADER VS LUKE FIGHT IS FASTER THAN MACE VS SIMIOUS OR VS DOOK THE ONLY FIGHTS THAT WERE SUPER FLASHY AND FAST WERE THE PHANTOM MENACE AND REVENGE OF THE SITH VS VADER DUELS IT SEEMS LIKE ESB AND FIGHTS GET LUMPED TOGETHER WITH
PREQUEL FIGHTS DUELS BETWEEN FULLY TRAINED COMBATANTS AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR POWER TRAINED FOR YEARS TO BE MASTER SWORDSMEN AND GIFTED IN THE WAYS OF USING THE FORCE IN BATTLE

OT FIGHTS OLD MEN CRIPPLES AND BARELY TRAINED UPSTARTS VADER HAD TO CHANGE HIS STYLE TO ADAPT TO HIS SUIT TATTOOING HAD NOT BEEN KIND TO BODY AND HE WAS NEARLY 2 DECADES OUT OF PRACTICE AND LUKE HAD ONLY JUST LEARNED WHAT A LIGHTSABER WAS A FEW YEARS BEFORE WE SEE HIS FIRST FIGHT IN THE MOVIES MUCH LESS BEEN TRAINED IN HOW TO USE ONE

EPISODE KALO IS THE MOST SKILLED FIGHTER IN THE FILM AS HE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN TRAINED FINN AND REY HAD NEVER HELD A LIGHTSABER IN THEIR LIVES AND ONCE FORCED TO FIGHT WITH ONE USE THEM IN MANNERS FITTING WHAT TRAINING THEY DID HAVE FINN USES THE LIGHTSABER LIKE A CLUB FLAILING WITH IT WITH LITTLE FINESSE WHILE REY USES HERS LIKE SOMEONE SELF-TAUGHT IN FIGHTING WITH A STAFF INCORPORATING PLENTY OF THRUSTS BUT LITTLE ELSE KALO HAD SOME TRAINING BUT FINN AND REY HAD TO FIGHT WITH A LIGHTSABER WITHIN A DAY OR TWO OF EVEN TOUCHING ONE FOR THE FIRST TIME

BASICALLY AS TIME GOES ON THE FIGHTERS GOT LESS AND LESS SKILLED OR IN PRACTICE
BECAUSE CARTOON CRAP CGI DIARRHEA ACTION SEQUENCES AND LACK OF REAL EMOTIONS AND TENSION

I MEAN PERSONALLY KNEW VADER LUKE THOUGHT VADER KILLED HIS FATHER AND THEN IT TURNS OUT HE'S HIS FATHER WHY WOULD THE GOOD GUYS FROM THE PREQUEL FIGHT AGAINST MAUL OR DOOK OR SIMIOUS OH YEAH THEY'RE THE BAD GUYS GOOD GUYS FIGHT AGAINST BAD GUYS GOTCHA
WE'RE REBELLING
PATIENCE YOU MUST HAVE MY YOUNG PADAWAN
THE POWER THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE IS IMMEASURABLE
PROBABLY COMES AROUND DECEMBER 1ST
SO WHY DO WE HAVE AN ENDOR THEME GOING ON HERE

THAT IS THE QUESTION
THERE IS BUTS ITS A ROGUE ONE EASTER EGG
MAYBE YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN WHAT IT EVEN IS YOU'RE ASKING FOR SINCE NOT EVERYONE IMPLICITLY KNOWS WHAT STARWARD RP MOD ENTAILS
YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT STAR WARS GALAXIES R SWGEMU
R SWGEMU COMMENTS WVKQ
THE IDEA IS THAT BEING A FORCE GHOST IS ALSO A FORM OF IMMORTALITY THEY WILL LAST FOREVER THEY ARE ALREADY ONE WITH THE COSMIC FORCE BUT THEY ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDIVIDUALITY THEY DONT NEED TO MOVE ON
I THINK THE IDEA BEHIND THE FORCE GHOST CONCEPT IS THAT IT'S A FORM OF IMMORTALITY JUST FADING AWAY SEEMS UNLIKELY BUT I THINK THEY'LL AVOID FORCE GHOSTS ANYWAY
THAT'S HOW IT WAS IN LEGENDS BUT THAT ISN'T HOW IT IS IN CANON IN CANON FORCE GHOSTS ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEARNED TO PRESERVE THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE FORCE

NORMALLY WHEN A PERSON DIES THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS AND SELF BECOME ONE WITH THE FORCE THEY FEED FROM THE LIVING FORCE BACK INTO THE GREATER COSMIC FORCE

HOWEVER WITH THE RIGHT TRAINING A PERSON CAN LEARN TO PRESERVE THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS AFTER THEY DIE PREVENTING IT FROM BEING LOST WITHIN THE COSMIC FORCE THEY ESSENTIALLY CAN SEPARATE THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE COSMIC FORCE IN THE FORM OF A SPIRIT

THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THERE IS ANY TIME LIMIT AT ALL WHOSE TRAINING WAS INCOMPLETE COULD STILL COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS EVEN DURING THE END OF THE CLONE WARS ACW AND AT SOME POINT AFTER ROTS

IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SITH TO LEARN THIS TECHNIQUE BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING THEY BELIEVE THE SITH ARE FOCUSED ON ACHIEVING PHYSICAL IMMORTALITY THEY WISH TO EXTEND THEIR MORTAL LIFE NOT EXIST BEYOND IT
IN THE OLD EU THEY CAN MOVE ON LIKE BEN BUT THAT WAS DUMB I HOPE THEY DON'T MOVE ON BECAUSE IT MAKES NO SENSE TO
I DON'T THINK WE NEED THEM BUT I FEEL LIKE LUCAS FILM WILL FORCE SOME FAN SERVICE IN THE NEXT MOVIE I DON'T THINK THEY'LL HAVE OBI WAN OR YODA TALK TO REY BUT I COULD SEE A SCENE WHERE LUKE IS TORN ABOUT TEACHING REY AND HE CONSULTS HIS OLD MASTERS BASED ON CANON THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE TWO NOT TO SHOW UP IN THE MOVIES IT'S REALLY AN ISSUE OF DO THE ACTORS WANT TO DO IT AND CAN THEY DO IT WITHOUT FORCING IT IN THERE
IF THEY KEEP THE RULES FROM LEGENDS THEY SHOULD HAVE FADED AWAY A LONG TIME AGO BUT IT'S ALL UP IN THE AIR NOW FORCE GHOSTS COULD LAST FOREVER IN THE NEW CANON I'D LOVE TO SEE A SCENE IN A FUTURE FILM OF OBI WAN YODA AND ANAKIN ALL SAYING THEIR LAST GOODBYES BEFORE SOME HUGE CONFRONTATION CLIMAX THAT REY AND LUKE HAVE TO FACE
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THEY BROKE UP BECAUSE THEY HAD NO WAY TO MONETIZE THEMSELVES DUE TO THE COPYRIGHTS PROTECTING THE MUSIC GREAT GROUP THOUGH I STILL HAVE THEM SAVED ON MY COMPUTER
WIKI
SOMETHING BETWEEN A FIGHTER AND A
I THINK LUKE LEIA ARE PROBABLY GOING TO END UP TOGETHER WHILE HAN IS FROZEN IN CARBONITE
GUYS I HAD TO WORK ALL WEEKEND AT THE ROLLER RINK AND COULDN'T GET TICKETS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT DON'T SPOIL ANYTHING FOR ME ALRIGHT I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH LUKE GET REVENGE ON THAT VADER GUY FOR KILLING BEN
DEFINITELY CALLING IT VADER IS PLAYING WITH LUKE TO LURE HIM TO THE DARK SIDE

I CAN'T BELIEVE HAN SOLO IS GONE AND THAT LANDO GUY THEY TRUSTED HIM AFTER WHAT HE DID HE COULD BE A DOUBLE AGENT

IT'S INTERESTING HOW LUKE AND LEIA WAS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE VIA TELEPATHY IT LOOKS LIKE LUKE HAS MORE FORCE POWER THAN WE THOUGHT

WHO IS THE MYSTERY GUY IN THE HOOD TALKING TO VADER WE KNOW IT'S MASTER BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR NOW

AND WOW WE GOT TO PEEK ANDR HELMET FOR A SECOND MAYBE HIS MASK IS HIS FACE AND HE HAS A HALF FLESH HALF MACHINE TYPE OF HEAD KIND OF LIKE ROBOCOP
I WAS EIGHT WHEN EMPIRE CAME OUT I WAS CRYING LIKE A BABY WHEN MY DAD AND I WALKED OUT OF THE THEATER I REMEMBER BEING MOST DISTRAUGHT OVER HAN BEING FROZEN IN CARBONITE I THOUGHT IT WAS GAME OVER FOR MY FAVORITE SMUGGLER

I WAS IN COMPLETE DENIAL ABOUT VADER BEING FATHER MY DAD DIDN'T HELP EITHER HE GOES YOU COULDN'T TELL THAT HE WAS FATHER BY WHAT HE SAID ABOUT LUKE BEING STRONG WITH THE FORCE WHEN THEY WERE GOING DOWN THE DEATH STAR TRENCH IN THE FIRST ONE NO DAD I'M FUCKING EIGHT YEARS OLD
VADER IS LYING TO TRY TO TRICK LUKE INTO JOINING THE DARK SIDE I THINK THAT BOBA FAT GUY WILL BE THE BIG VILLAIN IN THE NEXT MOVIE YOU KNOW HIS FIGHT WITH LUKE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE WILL BE RAD AS HECK
I BET CHEWIE HAS A KID
HONESTLY IF I HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE THEATER WATCHING THAT WHEN YODA SAYS THERE IS ANOTHER I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT FUCK YEA THERE IS ANOTHER JEDI RUNNING AROUND THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE

VADER TELLING LUKE HE IS HIS FATHER WOULD HAVE BROKEN MY MIND EVERYTHING OBI WAN TOLD LUKE WAS GOD DAMNED A LIE

THAT GREEN STORM TROOPER JUST NICKED HAN WHAT THE HELL WHY THE FUCK IS LANDO WEARING CLOTHES

WELL WE NOW KNOW THAT DARTH IS FATHER NOT ANAKIN THIS CALLS EVERYTHING SAID INTO QUESTION WHAT IF ANAKIN WAS REALLY KILLED BY


MASTER DOESN'T SEEM TO KNOW THAT ACTUALLY KID SINCE HE CALLS LUKE SON SINCE HE'S UNAWARE OF SUCH A MAJOR SECRET HE DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE MUCH OF A MASTERMIND TO ME I DOUBT HE'S GOING TO BE OUR MAIN ANTAGONIST


HERE'S WHAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN LUKE WILL TURN TO THE DARK SIDE AND BECOME THE FINAL VILLAIN YODA WILL HAVE TO RECRUIT TRUE SON MAYBE HAN TO DEFEAT HIM AND VADER
THERE IS ACTUALLY AN OLD BBS BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM MESSAGE THREAD ABOUT STAR WARS THAT I READ RECENTLY FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INTERNET PROBABLY ETC IT'S FASCINATING TO READ AND PEOPLE ARE ASKING THOSE SAME QUESTIONS WHO IS THIS OTHER ETC

I RECENTLY SAW IT POSTED ON R STARWARD BUT IT DIDN'T GET VERY MANY UPVOTES AND NOW I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THE LINK IT'S GOOD STUFF THOUGH
IF VADER IS LYING WHY DOESN'T BEN SHOW UP AND CALL HIM ON HIS BULLSHIT

YODA MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT HAN

BUT GOTTA DIE BECAUSE WHY WASTE THE WHOLE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST FILM GETTING HIM BACK JUST TO RETURN EVERYTHING BACK TO THE STATUS QUO
I THOUGHT YODA MEANT THAT HAN COULD BE A JEDI OR THAT MAYBE THERE WAS SOME OTHER GUY OUT THERE WHO COULD BE FOR SOME REASON AT THE TIME I WAS A KID I THOUGHT ONLY MEN COULD BECOME JEDI

VADER WAS A TOTAL LIAR OF COURSE

HAN BEING TAKEN AWAY LIKE THAT TOTALLY BLEW MY MIND AS A KID THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN LEIA AND CHEWIE DIDN'T SAVE HIM SO OBVIOUSLY LUKE WILLIAM WHEN THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND YOU ADD LUKE GETTING HIS HAND CUT OFF OH BOY
THE NY TIMES IS RIGHT THIS MOVIE DOESN'T HAVE AN ENDING IT JUST ENDS AND THE JEDI MASTER IS A MUPPET WITH THE VOICE OF MISS PIGGY I WANT MY SIX DOLLARS BACK
BOBA MUM

ALSO WHY ARE WE USING THE INTERNET IN THE
REMOVED
ARE WE SUPPOSE TO ASSUME THAT THERE IS NO LAUNDRY ROOM DRY CLEANING SERVICE ON THAT REBEL SHIP THAT LANDO COULDN'T GET HIS CLOTHES CLEAN AND NOT TAKE CLOTHES
BASTIA EVA GREEN
BASTIA IS PORTRAYED AS AN ASIAN WOMAN I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE TO STICK TO THAT BUT I'D LIKE TO
I THINK MAGGIE Q AS BASTIA FASSBENDER AS BEVAN AND TOM HARDY AS MALAK WOULD BE GREAT
I ALWAYS THOUGHT KARL URBAN WOULD MAKE A GOOD BARTH THE REST CAN BE PRETTY MUCH UNKNOWNS
I'D ALSO LIKE DANNY GLOVER AS JOLEE THOUGH FOR THE YOUNGSTERS THAT IS NOT THE SAME PERSON AS DONALD GLOVER WHO WAS RECENTLY CAST AS LANDO
YOU NAILED DARTH BEVAN AND BASTIA
WOW FASSBENDER AS BEVAN WOULD BE PERFECT
BEVAN HENRY CAVIL HE'S DARK AND BROODING HE CAN BE NARKY AND FUNNY AND HE'S GOOD LOOKING I CAN SEE HIM WINNING OVER BASTIA AGAINST HER BEST EFFORTS

BASTIA SHAN EMMA WATSON POSH ACCENT UPTIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL I CAN SEE HER FIGHTING HER AFFECTION FOR BEVAN WHILE FALLING HOPELESSLY IN LOVE

BARTH NASI TIMOTHY OLYPHANT OLDER THAN BEVAN AND BASTIA BUT WITH A GRIZZLED SWAGGER

CANCEROUS ORDO STEPHEN LANG HE'S PERFECT

HK THE ORIGINAL ACTOR HE'S JUST SO ICONIC

DARTH MALAK MICHAEL FASSBENDER HE MAKES A GREAT TORMENTED BAD GUY AND HE'S ALREADY PROVEN THAT HE CAN PLAY A GREAT PART WITHOUT SHOWING HIS FACE IN FRANK
FIREFIGHTING DAMAGE CONTROL
ALSO PROTECTS FROM COLLAPSING CEILINGS AND EXPLODING CONSOLES

EDIT HUH JUST FOUND SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING
I THINK THE HELMET WAS PATTERNED AFTER THE REAL WORLD US NAVY MK II TALKER HELMET
IT'S THAT BIG TO ACCOMMODATE OLD SCHOOL HEADPHONES WHILE STILL PROVIDING PROTECTION FROM SHRAPNEL
IT IS A MATTER OF IMPERIAL LAW THAT ALL IMPERIAL PERSONNEL MUST WEAR A SILLY HAT
BECAUSE THEY ARE AWESOME
THIS IS REALLY WELL-MADE THE STORM-TROOPER IS MY FAVORITE TIER DOES SHE BAKE CAKES FOR A LIVING AND WHAT FLAVOR IS IT INSIDE
IT'S MAN BEAR TROOPER
YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS INCREDIBLY TALENTED

HAPPY BIRTHDAY

CHEERS

THE ENGAGEMENT RING YOU'RE BUYING IS GONNA BE REALLY EXPENSIVE AFTER THAT CAKE
BEARS BEETS STAR WARS BIRTHDAY CAKE
HERE'S THE SITES




VERY COOL

HERE IS OUR STORM-TROOPER WEDDING CAKE



WHILST I LIKE THE IDEA OF INDIVIDUAL WORLDS RAISING THEIR OWN UNITS SUCH AS THE IMPERIAL GUARD DOES IN OR AS THE DIFFERENT TERRITORIES OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE DID IN THE REAL WORLD GURKHA OR MOUNTIE ANYONE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE CASE FOR THE EMPIRE

CONTRARY TO YOUR CLAIM THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT YOUR IDEA AND I THINK YOU'VE JUST IT

THE REASON THERE ARE SNOWTROOPERS IS TO FIGHT IN THE SNOW SANDTROOPERS FIGHT IN THE SAND SCOUT TROOPERS SCOUT DEATH TROOPERS DEATH THE POINT IS STORM-TROOPER EQUIPMENT IS DEFINED BY THE CLIMATE THEY ARE DEPLOYED TO JUST AS ANY MODERN CAPABLE MILITARY DOES WITH ITS OWN SOLDIERS

WHEN THE US WENT IN TO IRAQ IT DIDN'T ONLY SEND SOLDIERS FROM ARIZONA NEVADA AND NEW MEXICO IT EQUIPPED ITS SOLDIERS TO FIGHT IN THE DESERT
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE RIGHT IN THINKING DEATH TROOPERS ARE PERSONAL FORCE THEY SEEM TO ALWAYS FOLLOW OR ACCOMPANY KRENNIC IN THE FOOTAGE WE'VE SEEN SO FAR

ALSO SHORETROOPERS HAVE BEEN CALLED SARIF STORM-TROOPER OR SARIF SHORETROOPERS SO THEY PROBABLY ONLY EXIST TO PROTECT THE FACILITIES THERE WHICH MAKES ME WONDER WHAT THEY'D DO WITH ALL THAT GEAR AFTER THE EMPIRE NO LONGER NEEDS SARIF
I ALSO THINK YOU'RE TOO SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE EMPIRE NEEDING CLIMATE SPECIFIC ARMOR FOR ONE THING HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THE UNIFORM DESIGN CUES OF ALL STORM-TROOPER SNOWTROOPERS ARE PARTICULARLY SIMILAR TO STORM-TROOPER SANDTROOPERS ARE PRACTICALLY WEARING NORMAL STORM-TROOPER ARMOR MAGMATROOPERS HAVE NORMAL ARMOR PLUS A COOLING PACK IF A DOZEN DIFFERENT WORLDS WERE PROVIDING THE EQUIPMENT YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE MORE DEVIATION IF THESE ARE GURKHAS WHERE ARE THEIR KUKRI

THE DEATH KNELL I THINK IS THAT WE SEE THE CENTRALIZED PREDECESSORS OF MOST OF THESE TROOP TYPES IN THE CLONE ARMY I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME BELIEVING SCOUT TROOPERS ARE FROM A FOREST WORLD WHEN WE SEE ALMOST IDENTICAL ARMOR ON GAR CLONES

SORRY MAN I APPRECIATE THEORIES BUT I JUST CAN'T BUY THIS ONE THE EMPIRE IS ALL ABOUT CENTRALIZING CONTROL NOT JUST UNDER ONE GOVERNMENT BUT ONE MANUAL
EVERY PERSON IN MY THEATER CHEERED IT WAS AMAZING
IS THIS A BUZZFEED ARTICLE
IT'S SUCH AN OUTSTANDING MOMENT HOW MANY ICONIC MOVIE CHARACTERS GET REPRICED YEARS LATER BY THE SAME ACTOR ESPECIALLY IN A FRANCHISE AS BIG AS STAR WARS WHERE THE ENTIRE MOVIE BUILDS UP TO HIS FIRST APPEARANCE HE GETS TALKED ABOUT LIKE HE'S A MYTHICAL CREATURE
I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY CHILLING
I'D DESCRIBE IT MORE AS ANNOYING AND IMMERSION DESTROYING BUT THAT'S JUST ME I WAS HAPPY WHEN MY AUDIENCE REACTION WAS AWED SILENCE
DAMN I REGRET NOT GOING ON OPENING DAY
THAT WAS A PRETTY UNENTHUSED REACTION TO BE HONEST
THIS MUST BE AN AMERICAN THING SHOUTING AND CHEERING DURING A MOVIE SEEMS PRETTY RUDE TO ME
PABLO SAID THEY WEREN'T GOING TO FULLY CANONIZE OR REWRITE ANYTHING UNTIL THE TOR AMMO FINISHES UP OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE SERIES THIS WAS SAID ON HIS COLLIDER INTERVIEW AND NOT TWITTER
IF THEY GO OLD REPUBLIC CHANCES ARE IT WILL A NOT BE WHILE THE AMMO IS GOING ON AND B BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE LEGENDS VERSION AS PABLO SAID HE WANTED THE TECHNOLOGY TO HAVE AN ANCIENT OLDER FEEL AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN ANCIENT JEDI WITH LIGHTSABERS THAT LOOK MORE LIKE BLADES THAN THE ROD SHAPE OF THE MOVIES

I ACTUALLY THINK LIVE ACTION UNLESS IT'S A BIG BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE WOULD BE A BAD IDEA FOR ONE IT'S FAR EASIER TO ANIMATE A LOT OF SCI-FI STUFF RATHER THAN DO IT IN MOVIES AND TOO MUCH SPECIAL EFFECTS IN MOVIES WILL GARNER CRIES OF BUT WHAT ABOUT PRACTICAL EFFECTS TWO IT MEANS MORE VARIABILITY IN SPECIES IS POSSIBLE THREE A SHOW LIKE ACW OR A VIDEO GAME LIKE KOROR ALLOWS MORE CONTENT AND A FULLER STORY IF THEY DON'T WANT TO INVEST THE MONEY IN ANIMATION OR A VIDEO GAME A COMIC SERIES HAS THE SAME UPSIDES OF MORE FLEXIBILITY IN ART AND LENGTH OF STORY
THE CLONE WARS I DON'T EXPECT TO SEE AGAIN ONSCREEN FOR A LONG TIME THAT'S THE ERA THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE LAST IN THE ROTATION RIGHT NOW AS THEY SPENT THE BETTER PART OF YEARS TELLING THOSE STORIES

IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE AMMO I WOULD EXPECT SOME VAGUELY OLD REPUBLIC FILMS WITHIN THE DECADE BUT I GATHER THAT THE LIFE EXPECTANCY FIGURES IN THERE BUT I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THEY'LL GO BACK IT SEEMS LIKE THE OBVIOUS CHOICE MAYBE EVEN A DAWN OF THE JEDI TYPE OF THING
WE PROBABLY WON'T SEE ANY LIVE ACTION REPRESENTATIONS OF THOSE ERAS FOR A WHILE SADLY HOWEVER REPAWN IS WORKING ON AN UNTITLED VIDEO GAME THAT IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE IN AN ERA NOT YET EXPLORED BY THE NEW CANON WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS YET THOUGH AND THE GAME WON'T BE RELEASED FOR A FEW MORE YEARS
HOPEFULLY A LONG TIME FOR CLONE WARS BECAUSE THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT CLONE WARS AND AS A NEW REPUBLIC FAN THAT IS REALLY REALLY ANNOYING THE OLD REPUBLIC MIGHT BE BETTER BUT I WOULD RATHER IT BE MORE LIKE THE TALES OF THE JEDI COMICS THAN THE KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC GAMES
ARE YOU NOT COUNTING EU
I HIGHLY DOUBT WE GET ANYTHING OTHER THAN A TV SERIES ABOUT THE CLONE WARS AND IT WON'T FEATURE ANY OF THE PREMIERE CHARACTERS IF IT HAPPENS
THEY'LL DEFINITELY GO BACK BUT NOT FOR A WHILE AT LEAST NOT UNTIL THEY'VE SATED EVERYBODY WITH LIKE KENOBI MOVIES AND FILMS ABOUT THE LIFE AND TIMES OF TREADWELL THE DROID
THEY'LL DEFINITELY GO BACK I'VE HEARD PABLO HIDALGO SAY AS MUCH IN PERSON
I HOPE THEY NEVER DO THE OLD REPUBLIC THAT SERIES ALWAYS SEEMED TOO WEIRD AND TO BE STAR WARS
I DOUBT IT EITHER THEY'LL CLEARLY ESCAPE OR THEY'LL BE KILLED THIS SORT OF DIES IN ANOTHER MOVIE ENDING IS LAME
NAH VADER GONNA MURDER ALL OF THEM I JUST HOPE WE GET TO SEE IT
PLOT TWIST AYN ESCAPES DURING THE FIRE FIGHT KNOCKS OUT A TIE PILOT AND STEALS HIS UNIFORM AND BANKS HER TIE INTO VADER AS HE'S ABOUT TO KILL LUKE SACRIFICING HERSELF TO THE REBELLION

S
I EXPECT SOME MEMBERS AT LEAST TO BE HELD PRISONER ON IT IT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY OF KILLING THEM OFF SCREEN
I COULD STILL APPRECIATE THIS MOVIE JUST BEING A STORY I JUST HATE KILLING OFF SOME CHARACTERS WHEN THERE ARE STILL POTENTIAL STORY OPPORTUNITIES
IT SEEMS AND ACTUALLY KIND OF A GAG FOR AYN OR WHOEVER TO GET SHIPPED OFF TO THE DEATH STAR THEY SHOULD EITHER SURVIVE OR WE SHOULD SEE THEM DIE ON SCREEN
MAYBE HER AND LEIA HAD A LESBIAN PRISON AFFAIR
AND THEN THE CREW RETIRED TO THE PEACEFUL WORLD OF ALDERMAN
I SUSPECT THEY WILL ALL DIE IN ROGUE ONE BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT BEFORE GETTING THE DEATH STAR PLANS HANDED OFF IN SOME FASHION TO THE TACTIVE IV LEIA
I'D RATHER IT BE IMPLIED THAT SHE HEADS OFF TO ALDERMAN AT THE END OF THE MOVIE
I'M STICKING WITH MY THEORY THAT THERE IS ZERO CHANCE OF AYN DYING THERE IS SO MUCH POTENTIAL FOR A WHOLE SERIES OF FILMS FOLLOWING HER ADVENTURES DURING THE REBELLION JUST THINK OF THE MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES AND APPEAL TO THE FEMALE DEMOGRAPHIC IT WOULD BE A WASTE TO KILL HERALDRY ALSO FAIRLY UNPRECEDENTED MAJOR MOVIE STUDIOS GENERALLY DON'T KILL BLOCKBUSTER PROTAGONISTS ESPECIALLY AFTER ONE MOVIE
NAH THERE WILL BE SOME DEATHS BUT THE SURVIVORS ARE GONNA GET AWAY AND HIDE IN ALDERMAN
I DOUBT THEY'LL KILL OFF AYN THIS COULD BE A WHOLE NEW BRANCH OF STAR WARS FILMS IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO KILL THEM OFF PARTICULARLY THE MAIN CHARACTER
YOU SHOULD FULLY EXPECT ANY NEW CHARACTER IN ROGUE ONE TO PROBABLY DIE
THIS IS REMINDING ME OF SOMEONE WHO SAID REBELS WILL END WITH THE GHOST CREW HAPPILY AWAITING LEIA ARRIVAL ON ALDERMAN
I'M SURE AYN WASN'T ON THAT THING WHEN IT BLEW
IF THEY GET CAPTURED EITHER THEY'RE NOT ALIVE LONG ENOUGH FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DEATH STAR TO MATTER OR IT'S THE BETTER WAY TO GO
SHE WOULD BE IMPRISONED ON CELL BLOCK
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENED GIVEN THAT WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF THESE CHARACTERS BY NAME BEFORE
YEAH I LIKE TO THINK THAT ROGUE ONE DONT END RIGHT BEFORE TV START OF ANH BUT RIGHT BEFORE THE END OF IT WITH SOME SCENES HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY

AYN WATCHING THE OLD GANG RUNNING THROUGH THE CELL BLOCK FROM INSIDE HER CELL HEARING THE BLASTS CHERIES ROARS OR SOMETHING
WOULDNT THINK SO THERE WOULD BE MENTION OF IT IN EPISODE YOU WOULDN'T BLOW UP A BASE FULL KNOWING THAT THEY ARE STILL THERE AND JUST BE OK WITH IT
THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF AND THEY WENT DOWN IN HISTORY AS NAMELESS HEROES PART AT THE END OF THE FILM FOR IT TO FULLY MAKE SENSE STARKVILLE WAS MEMORIALIZED FOREVER IN THE REBEL INSIGNIA AND HE DIDN'T EVEN DO THAT MUCH I KNOW FU IS NO LONGER CANON BUT THE LOGIC STILL STANDS
SHE WAS PILOTING THE TIE FIGHTER WHICH BOUNCED INTO VADER IN THE TRENCH RUN
IF I LOOK AT THE INFO WE GOT NOW I WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF WE FIND HER DAD TO BE HELD ALIVE INSIDE THAT ACTA TANK STORY WISE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT SHE EXPECTS TO MEET UP WITH HER DAD ONLY TO REALISE THAT SHE HAS TO LEAVE HIM BEHIND AND OF COURSE HAS TO LET HIM DIE
AND YES I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS WILL BE WHAT HAPPENS IN ROUGE JUAN
SHORT STORY SPOILER S THERE WAS A MASSIVE PRISON BREAK ON THE FIRST DEATH STAR WE ACTUALLY SEE ONE OF THE ESCAPEES IN EPISODE VII
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THEY WOUND UP ON ALDERMAN AND WAS THERE WHEN IT WAS DESTROYED
I'D BE COOL WITH THIS
I STRONGLY DOUBT THERE WILL BE A TON OF MAJOR CHARACTER DEATHS KEY WORD MAJOR ONE OR MAYBE MAYBE TWO AT THE MOST AND THERE DEFINITELY WON'T BE ANY IMPLICATION OF AN OFF SCREEN DEATH EVEN IF IT'S TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE

IT'S RATED PG BUT IT'S EXPLICITLY A FAMILY MOVIE THEY WANT TO GRAB EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC AND WHEN THERE'S KIDS INVOLVED YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES

BASICALLY YOU CAN COUNT OUT MASS MAIN CHARACTER DEATH AND SACRIFICE KEY WORD MAIN AND OUR LEAD PROTAGONIST IS PRETTY MUCH BULLET PROOF IF THERE IS DEATH IT WILL BE TO SERVE ANOTHER CHARACTERS GROWTH DIRECTLY AND IT WILL BE PROJECTED MOST LIKELY DIRECTLY WITH DANGER BUT ALMOST DEFINITELY BY BEING A NEARLY FLAWLESS PERSON WITHOUT NEED FOR GROWTH OR IMPROVEMENT

AT THE END THEY'LL PROBABLY GIVE A CUTE EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THE CHARACTERS WERE RELEVANT IN THE OT MOVIES BUT NOT PRESENT BUT THEY COULD EVEN GET AWAY WITH GIVING AN EXTREMELY SIMPLE GO TO THIS PLANET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GALAXY EXPLANATION

IT MAY BE GRITTIER IN EXECUTION AND THOUGH IT DOESN'T LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT IN THE TRAILERS BUT THEY'RE STILL JONESIAN FOR THAT STAR WARS NICHE MONEY AND KILLING EVERYONE EVEN KILLING MOST IS A BIG RED FLAG TO PARENTS FOR WHEN EPISODE COMES AROUND AND EVERYONE IS SAYING THIS ONE WILL BE THE MOST GRITTY ONE YET ALL HAIL ZACH SNYDER
I LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD
SHE SURVIVES NO WAY DISNEY KILLS THE FIRST FEMALE LEAD BACKLASH WOULD BE INSANE
CORUSCANT IS A WORD ITSELF MEANING GLITTERING OR SPARKLING AND IS PRONOUNCED AS YOU FOUND ON YOUR TRIP TO YOUTUBE HOWEVER THE PLANET'S NAME IS NOT PRONOUNCED THE SAME THE CORRECT WAY TO SAY IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE

I MANAGED TO FIND A CLIP THAT FEATURES SAYING THE PLANET'S NAME HERE STARTS AT I ALSO FOUND ANOTHER CHARACTER SAYING IT JUST TO BE SURE
HERE STARTS AT
HIS PRONUNCIATION IS DEFINITELY WRONG THEY SAY THE NAME ALL THE TIME IN THE FILMS AND THE CLONE WARS SO I DON'T SEE HOW THIS ARGUMENT HAPPENED HAHA
YOU'RE BOTH WRONG IT'S
WELL YOU'RE BOTH SAYING IT WRONG IF YOUR ENDING WITH SENT
THEY SAY IT THE WAY YOU SAY IT IN THE FILMS YOUR FRIEND IS WRONG
I'M PRETTY SURE YOUR PRONUNCIATION IS CORRECT
HOW CAN YOU WATCH THROUGH THE MOVIES AND NOT KNOW HOW TO SAY IT
CORUSCANT WAIT UH THAT DOESN'T COMPUTE UH YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
TIMOTHY ZAHN TALKS ABOUT THIS IN AN INTERVIEW AT WHEN HE GAVE THIS NAME TO THE IMPERIAL REPUBLIC CAPITAL PLANET IN HEIR TO THE EMPIRE HE DID SO IN THE LITERAL SENSE THAT U THEKIERANATOR DESCRIBES GLITTERING BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN DESCRIBED BY LUCAS AS ONE BIG CITY WORDS THAT WERE LATER IMMORTALLY ECHOED BY RIC ALIE WITH THAT IN MIND PRONUNCIATION WAS AS YOUR FRIEND PRONOUNCED IT

THAT'S HOW I ALWAYS HEARD IT IN MY MIND WHILE READING THE BOOKS SO THE TPM PRONUNCIATION WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY DEFINITIVE FELT A BIT WEIRD TO ME THOUGH I ACTUALLY PREFER THE SOUND OF THAT NOW

INTERESTINGLY THE ANNIVERSARY AUDIOBOOK OF HEIR NARRATED BY MARC THOMPSON PRONOUNCES IT AS DESPITE BEING RECORDED LONG AFTER ROTS
KOR US KANT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONES TRYING TO READ THE WORD LITERALLY WE ALL KNOW HOW ENGLISH WORKS THOUGH
JUST WATCH THE MOVIES THEY SAY IT A HUNDRED TIMES
THATS OK I HAVE A FRIEND WHO KEEPS SAYING IT LIKE CORE SUH KUHN

YOUR FRIEND'S PRONUNCIATION WAS HOW I PRONOUNCED IT WHEN READING HEIR TO THE EMPIRE THE FIRST USE OF THE NAME HAVING THAT PRONUNCIATION IN MY HEAD FOR YEARS I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION IN THE PHANTOM MENACE
WHEN I WAS A KID I ALWAYS PRONOUNCED TATTOOING AS

ALSO UTAPAU AS

MY STAR WARS FRIEND HAD TO CORRECT ME BOTH TIMES
DOOK HAS THE WEIRDEST PRONUNCIATION WHEN HE RECEIVES THE DEATH STAR PLANS FROM BOGGLE THE LESSER HE CALLS IT
HERE IT IS


HAHAHAHAHAHAAH I HAVEN'T LAUGHED OUT LOUD IN A LONG TIME
LOOKS LIKE THEY CHANGED THAT I REBEL LINE TO HAVE A MORE DEFINITIVE INFLECTION
WHY WOULD THIS NOT BE EXPECTED YOU DON'T BRING IN SOMEONE AS ACCOMPLISHED AS HIM TO REMIX JOHN WILLIAMS
I HOPE WE GET THE CLASSIC DEATH STAR MOTIF
IF THEY WANT TO KEEP THE SPIRIT OF THE UNIQUE I THINK IT'S VITAL THAT THEY FIND A DISTINCT BALANCE BETWEEN RECOGNIZABLE STAR WARS ELEMENTS AND ORIGINAL MATERIAL OF COURSE THE STYLE THE WORLDS SOME CHARACTERS ARE VITAL TO GIVE VIEWERS THE SENSE THEY ARE WATCHING A FILM THAT IS PART OF A LARGER STAR WARS UNIVERSE YET WHEN IT COMES TO STUFF LIKE AN OPENING CRAWL OR A SOUNDTRACK I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE THE ARE BECOMING THE BACKBONE OF A THAT IS RAPIDLY EXPANDING BY NOT USING THE STAR WARS SOUNDTRACK AND OR OPENING CRAWL FOR MOVIES LIKE ROGUE ONE THAT BACKBONE REMAINS SOLID IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME JUST HAVE A FEW CUES OF THE FORCE THEME FROM TIME TO TIME IS ALL I ASK
THIS IS GOOD I EXPECT THOSE SLIGHT HOMAGES TO BE THE FORCE THEME AND REBEL FANFARE GIACCHINO IS SO TALENTED I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HE CAN BRING TO THE TABLE
HE CAN BE HIT AND MISS FOR ME BUT WHEN HE IS AT HIS BEST DISPLAT CAN'T TOUCH HIM UP IS A MASTERPIECE AND JUPITER ASCENDING IS A BRILLIANT ORIGINAL ORCHESTRAL SCORE WHICH PROVES HE HAS GOT THE CHOPS FOR THIS

PERSONALLY IF THERE'S NO JEDI IN ROGUE ONE I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE FORCE THEME AGAIN THAT THING NEEDS A REST TO KEEP IT FROM GOING STALE
WHAT I EXPECTED TO BE HONEST HE'S A VERY TALENTED COMPOSER IN HIS OWN RIGHT SO A BLEND OF MASTER AND APPRENTICE SHOULD BE PERFECT
GREAT I FEEL LIKE WE NEED A NEW TAKE ON IT NOW OFCOURSE JOHN WILLIAMS IS AMAZING BUT ITS TIME TO TURN IT OVER TO THE NEW BLOOD
I JUST WANT SOME NICE IMPERIAL MARCH REPRISES FOR SCENES
GIACCHINO HAS DONE BEEEEEYOOOOOTIFUL WORK ON PIXAR FILMS HE'S ONE OF THE FEW COMPOSERS WHO I'M OKAY WITH REPLACING WILLIAMS
THAT'S NOT REALLY THAT DIFFERENT TO WHAT JOHN WILLIAMS DOES FOR EACH NEW MOVIE THERE ARE CALLBACKS TO MOTIFS BUT EACH SCORE IS PRETTY ORIGINAL SO SOUNDS GOOD TO ME
MOSTLY ORIGINAL EXCEPT FOR THE IMPERIAL MARCH I'M LIKE SURE THE MARCH WILL BE IN THE FILM
HE DID AMAZING FOR BOTH STAR TREK AND DOCTOR STRANGE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

HIS CLOSER FOR DOCTOR STRANGE WAS STRAIGHT UP PINK FLOYD LOVED IT
HE SAID THIS ABOUT JURASSIC PARK AND SO VERY WRONG
I HONESTLY HOPE THEY USE CHRISTIAN BACZUKS WORK EVENTUALLY HE REALLY DOES A FEELS
PERHAPS YOU THINK YOU ARE BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY
I EXPECT THE HOMAGES TO BE SOMETHING IMPERIAL MARCH ESC FOR WHEN VADER APPEARS
MOSTLY
THAT DOES NOT BODE WELL I KNEW THE SOUNDTRACK WOULD GO THIS WAY WHEN GIACCHINO WAS BROUGHT ON THE PROJECT
I WANT ALEXANDRE DISPLAT BACK
AS STAR WARS EXPANDS BEYOND THE SAGA FILMS AND THE INFLUENCES THAT WERE SPECIFIC TO THE SAGA FILMS LIKE OLD ADVENTURE SERIALS IT MAKES SENSE THAT THEY WOULD DROP SOME GENRE AFFECTATIONS LIKE THE OPENING CRAWL AS THE FILMS EVOLVE INTO NEW GENRES

THE WHOLE POINT OF ROGUE ONE IS TO EXPAND WHAT THE DEFINITION OF A STAR WARS MOVIE IS SO IT MAKES SENSE THEY WOULD DITCH THE OPENING CRAWL ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS SEEMS TO BE MORE OF A GRITTY WAR FILM RATHER THAN A JAUNTY ERA SWASHBUCKLING ADVENTURE FLICK HELL IF ANYTHING ROGUE ONE SHOULD PROBABLY BE OPENING WITH A NEWSREEL RATHER THAN AN OPENING CRAWL

ALSO THE FACT THAT THE OPENING CRAWL AN AFFECTATION EXCLUSIVE TO CINEMATIC MOVIE LANGUAGE WAS CRAMMED INTO MOST STAR WARS BOOKS WAS ALWAYS RIDICULOUS
JEDI ARE PART OF STAR WARS SKYWALKERS ARE PART OF STAR WARS EWOS AND MIDICHORIANS ARE PART OF STAR WARS NOT EVERY STAR WARS STORY HAS TO FEATURE EVER SINGLE PART I'M FINE WITH THERE BEING NO CRAWL I THINK IT'S A SIGN THEY ARE CONFIDENT THAT THIS MOVIE WILL STAND ON ITS OWN AS A UNIQUE ADDITION TO STAR WARS CANON AND AS FAR AS MOVIES GO IT LEAVES SOMETHING EXTRA SPECIAL FOR THE MAIN EPISODES

IN THE MOVIES THE OTHER CRAWLS HAD AT LEAST YEARS IN-BETWEEN EACH ONE WITH A NEW MOVIE COMING OUT EVERY YEAR NOW FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS THE CRAWL MIGHT START TO BECOME LESS SPECIAL IF IT WERE A PART OF EACH
STAR WARS FANS AS ALWAYS MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A MOLEHILL I REMEMBER PEOPLE BEING ANGRY ABOUT DISNEY PURCHASING LUCASFILM BECAUSE THE MOVIES WILL NOT HAVE THE FOX FANFARE ANYMORE
IN MY OPINION IT'S PART OF AN EFFORT TO ESTABLISH A NEW SEPARATION BETWEEN SAGA AND STAND ALONE CONTENTION THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR MEDIA RELEASES AFTER THE ACQUISITION THEY'RE TRYING TO SET A PRECEDENT
CONSIDER THE OTHER MAJOR RELEASES SINCE ACQUISITION
FFA HAD A CRAWL IS CONSIDERED A SAGA RELEASE
REBELS HAS THE SCREEN WITH STAR WARS REBELS AND MUSIC
STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT HAS THE STAR WARS SCREEN WITH MUSIC

I DON'T BELIEVE WE'LL BE SEEING CRAWLS OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN SAGA ANYMORE JUST MY TAKE
I THINK THIS IS A STUPID SUBJECT WITH OR WITHOUT A CRAWL THE IMPORTANT PART OF THE MOVIE ISN'T HAPPENING WITHIN THE FIRST 2 MINUTES ISN'T EVERYONE MORE INTERESTED IN THE ACTUAL MOVIE
TECHNICALLY THE CLONE WARS MOVIE WAS THE FIRST CANON MOVIE IT DID NOT HAVE A CRAWL
I'M EXCITED FOR WHAT THEY'LL DO INSTEAD
THAT WAS MY REACTION AS WELL TO SAYING THEY DIDN'T WANT IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE SAGA YET ALMOST ALL OTHER STAR WARS NON TRILOGY STUFF HAS IT BECAUSE IT'S JUST BECOME SOMETHING YOU HAVE IN STAR WARS CONTENT LOL
I KIND OF WISH THEY'D DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS TEASER WHERE THE EPISODE IV CRAWL STARTS AND THEN TURNS UPWARDS TOWARDS THE SCREEN GAVE ME CHILLS THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT

WATCH V UMUWQISDMPU


NO ONE COMPLAINS THAT ACW DOESN'T START WITH AN OPENING CRAWL
THE BOOKS DON'T HAVE A MOVING YELLOW WORDED PARAGRAPH SET AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF SPACE WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP SAYING THIS
WHAT THE BOOKS HAVE IS THEIR OWN VERSION OR SPIN ON A CRAWL IT'S SIMILAR BUT UNIQUE TO BOOKS THAT IS WHAT ROGUE ONE WILL HAVE
I AM ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT STRONGLY AGREE THIS SHOULD HAVE A TRADITIONAL OPENING CRAWL I ACTUALLY DID MY PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT SPEECH FOR MY PUBLIC SPEAKING CLASS ON THIS VERY TOPIC LAST WEEK MY THREE MAIN TALKING POINTS WERE EUPHORIA HISTORICAL AND CLARITY


EUPHORIA I THINK THIS IS OBVIOUS FOR MANY STAR WARS FANS

HISTORY LIKE YOU SAID BOOKS HAVE THEM EVEN THE NEW ONES AND SO DOES EVERY VIDEO GAME I CAN THINK OF AND THAT IS A LOT OF THEM

CLARITY HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU SEE CONFUSED ABOUT WHEN THIS MOVIE TAKES PLACE AND WHY IS DARTH VADER IN IT OR WHAT ABOUT REY AND FINN THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF CONFUSED PEOPLE CASUAL VIEWERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE CONFUSED
IF YOU PLAN ON WATCHING REBELS AFTER YOU'VE FINISHED CLONE WARS SEASON 2 MIGHT EMOTIONALLY WRECK YOU BE WARNED
DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL AFTER SEASON

TWO UNFINISHED EPISODE ARCS ONE IS INCLUDED ON THE BOTH ON
SON OF DATHOMIR COMIC
ASOKA STORYBOARD FROM CELEBRATION EUROPE

I THINK THAT'S THE CORRECT ORDER TO SEE THEM ALSO
IT'LL DO THAT TO YOU

GOOD TO SEE SOME POSITIVITY HERE BEEN SEEING A LOT OF NEGATIVE POSTS ABOUT THE MORE RECENT CANON INSTALLMENTS TO INCLUDE ACW
WHAT'D YOU THINK OF THE FIGHT IN THE SEASON EPISODE THE LAWLESS
MY MAN OP CLONE WARS IS AN EXCELLENT SHOW MANUAL I LOVE IT A LOT SO WE'LL DONE ANAKIN AND OBI WAN AND THE CLONES AND ASOKA WERE SO WELL DEVELOPED

ITS A GREAT SHOW AND EXCELLENT PART OF THE STAR WARS MYTHOLOGY IT EVEN REDEEMS THE PREQUEL A BIT IN MY EYES
IT DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING THE FLAWS AND WHY ANAKIN WOULD DISTRUST THEM WITHOUT OUTRIGHT MAKING THE AUDIENCE QUESTION WHY THE JEDI ARE THE GOOD GUYS

AND IF YOU THOUGHT GAVE YOU EMOTIONAL TORQUE WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE
I AGREE CLONE WARS IS AMAZING AND ASOKA IS MY FAVORITE STAR WARS CHARACTER I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND READING THE ASOKA BOOK THAT JUST CAME OUT AFTER YOU FINISH THE SHOW
THERE IS A BRIEF CAMEO OF SORTS OF ASOKA IN SEASON
IT JUST WORKS SO WELL IT REALLY IS A MUCH BETTER PATH TO MAKE SENSE OF CHARACTER AND WHY HE WOULD BEGIN TO QUESTION THE WAY OF THE JEDI
THE CLONE WARS WAS AMAZING REWATCHING IT NOW AND STUNNED BY HOW GOOD IT ACTUALLY IS
YESTERDAY I WATCHED THE NEW EPISODE OF REBELS AND IT WAS HORRIBLE WORST EPISODE I HAVE SEEN OF THE SHOW JUST MAKES ME SAD
ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT I DONT DISLIKE REBELS AT ALL BUT ACW WAS SO MUCH BETTER
I THINK MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE CLONE WARS AND NOW REBELS IS HOW REX WOLFE AND GREGOR AVOIDED ORDER IN REBELS IT WAS JUST SAID THEY HAD REMOVED THEIR CHIPS AND IN CLONE WARS IS SEEMS THAT THE ISSUE WITH THE CHIPS DIED WITH FIVES
IF YOU LIKED THE FINAL ARC OF SEASON THEN YOU WILL LIKE THIS VIDEO
WATCH V

DON'T WORRY THERE ARE NO SPOILERS FOR YOU
ASOKA AND ACW SEASON END SCENE IS ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS IN ALL OF SW RECENTLY NOTICED THAT AS SHE IS WALKING AWAY A TEAR GOES DOWN HER CHEEK BUT SHE IS ABLE TO COPE WITH THE DECISION ASOKA IS AN STRONG AND AMAZING CHARACTER
IT'S BEEN A WHILE BUT I KNOW CLONE WARS HAD THE LOST EPISODES AS WELL MAKE SURE YOU'VE SEEN THOSE
I JUST WATCHED IT 2 MONTHS AGO AND I'VE ALMOST RECOVERED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER IF THEY ACTUALLY DIDN'T CANCEL AND SHOW MORE OF ASOKA AND HER PAST
HEY OP WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE ARC MINE IS IS BATTLE OF UMBRA ARC AND MORTIS ARC
NICE SOME POSITIVITY AND YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY WHO LIKED ASOKA FROM THE BEGINNING I LOVED HER SHE WAS JUST A YOUNG PADAWAN WHO WAS EAGER TO PROVE HERSELF TO A JEDI LIKE ANAKIN I LIKED HOW WE SAW ANAKIN EVOLVE IN THE CLONE WARS AND TO SEE HOW THE CLONES FELT ABOUT THE WAR
HERE IS A SUPPLEMENTARY SCENE FROM THE UNFINISHED BUT STILL CANON UTAPAU ARC THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PART OF SEASON I CONSIDER IT MY FAVORITE SCENE OF THE ENTIRE CLONE WARS NO BLASTERS FIRING NO LIGHTSABERS SWINGING JUST TWO MINUTES OF DIALOGUE
THE ONLY ONE I CAN THINK OF THAT HAD A SIMILAR EFFECT FOR ME WAS THE OG AVATAR SERIES

THIS IS THE ONLY SHOW I FEEL WAS AT LEAST AS GOOD AS THIS ONE
TITLE RELEASEINFO REF
I WOULD GUESS KOREA WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST SOUTH KOREA MIND YOU
DON'T SPIN IT HE IS MEANING CREATING HIS VISION WHICH IS WHY THEY HIRED HIM A FILM MADE TO PLEASE ALL FANS WOULD BE A MESS AS CASUAL FANS AND DIE-HARD FANS HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THINGS

WAS THIS POST REALLY NECESSARY
HE'S BASICALLY SAYING YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT IF LUCASFILM ACTUALLY MADE OF THINGS I SEE FANS WANTING STAR WARS WOULD BE PRETTY BAD
GOOD ON HIM
THAT'S A GREAT THING INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYONE AT THE SAME TIME FOCUS ON TRYING TO PLEASE YOURSELF
IT IS A VERY INTERESTING IDEA OF MAKING A MOVIE FOR YOURSELF
PRETTY SURE IT WAS BANE
DARTH BANE IS WIDELY REGARDED AS THE
THE IS NOT CANON
I'VE BELIEVED THIS AS LONG AS I'VE HEARD OF THE I BELIEVED THAT THE DARTH BANE WAS FALSELY LABELED IT AND IT WAS VADER WHO TRULY FULFILLED THE PROPHECY

IT WOULD MAKE ONLY MAKE SENSE THAT TO BRING TRUE BALANCE TO THE FORCE HE WOULD NEED TO BE BOTH THE CHOSEN ONE AND THE WHILE THE JEDI PRESUMED THAT WOULD MEAN ERADICATING THE SITH IT APPARENTLY MEANS THAT IT'S NECESSARY FOR THERE TO BE NEITHER ORDER IN THE GALAXY

AND THE THIRD LINE OF THE PROPHECY MAY REFER TO HIM IN AN UNEXPECTED WAY BY MAKING THE SITH STRONGER AFTER DESTROYING THEM HE'S MAKING THEM STRONGER BY NOT BEING TIED TO THE DARK SIDE
GOOD QUESTION I DO BELIEVE THOUGH THAT IN EPISODE III YODA REFERS TO ANAKIN AS DARTH VADER WHEN SENDING TO KILL ANAKIN
HE HEARD PALATINE CALL HIM DARTH VADER IN THE HOLORECORDING
HE SAW THE VIDEO OF HIM BEING DUBBED BY PALATINE

SO LIKE RIGHT AWAY PALATINE CALLED HIM VADER WHEN TALKING TO YODA YODA AND OBI WAN TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING OBVIOUSLY AFTER THE FIGHT

THE QUESTION IS WHEN DID EVADERS PRESENCE AGAIN BECOME NEWS AND THAT HE WAS ALIVE BECOME KNOWN

MAYBE A FEW YEARS IN THE OUTER RIM BUT I'M SURE THAT NEWS FILTERED OUT
WELL THERE'S NO ACTUAL CONFIRMATION ON HOW HE FOUND OUT ANAKIN SURVIVED AND WAS VADER WE ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT DID OVER THE YEARS BETWEEN ROTS AND ANH BUT SINCE LUKE HAD NO IDEA WHO VADER WAS WHEN HE FIRST HEARD OF HIM WE COULD ASSUME THAT HASN'T BEEN ON TATTOOING ALL THOSE YEARS
IN THE LEGEND'S RISE OF DARTH VADER BOOK FOUND OUT WHEN HE WAS SHADOWING OWEN BARU LUKE AND OVERHEARD A NEWS REPORT TALKING ABOUT LORD VADER DEFEATING SOME RENEGADE JEDI AT LEAST THAT'S ONE INSTANCE I RECALL

DON'T MEAN DICK NOW OF COURSE PROBABLY HEARD IT ON SPACE CNN

HE SEES THE RECORDING OF ANAKIN BEING NAMED VADER SO I ASSUME AT ONE POINT HE HEARD THE NAME AND THAT WAS THAT
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS EVER AN ANSWER GIVEN

ALTHOUGH IN LEGENDS ACTUALLY BELIEVED ANAKIN WAS DEAD FOR SOMETIME UNTIL HE OVERHEARD A NEWS REPORT TALKING ABOUT DARTH VADER AND THAT'S WHEN HE REALIZED ANAKIN HAD SURVIVED THE FIGHT ON MUSTAFAR
IN CANON I DON'T BELIEVE WE KNOW BUT PROBABLY JUST HEARD NAME ON SPACE NEWS OR SOMETHING
ALL I'M HEARING ARE ORCHESTRAL SOUNDS I HEAR A WHOOP SOUND BUT I THINK THAT'S FROM THE STRING SECTION I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK IT'S A SOUND EFFECT THAT HAS BLENDED INTO THE SCORE
I CHECKED OTHER EDITIONS OF THE SONG AND IN ALL OF THEM SOUNDS THAT WHOOOOP
EVERYONE DOESN'T THINK THAT SO YOUR POINT IS MOOT BUT A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT ARE PROBABLY BIG VADER FANS AND THOSE PEOPLE TEND TO BE HYPER DEFENSIVE ABOUT ANYONE TRYING TO FILL HIS VILLAIN SHOES

OR THEY ARE PISSED ABOUT HAN OR THEY COMPLETELY MISREAD THE HAN SCENE BUT IT ALSO DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY MEAN BY WEAK BECAUSE IN THE FINAL FIGHT HE WAS WEAK BOTH DUE TO INJURY AND EMOTIONALLY
HE'S NOT

ALL THE COMMENTS FROM PEOPLE IN THE THREAD SAYING HE IS WEAK DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CHARACTER JUST WANTED AN EMOTIONLESS EVIL BADASS WITH NO DEPTH LIKE VADER FROM ANH COUNTING JUST WHAT WE KNEW OF HIM FROM THAT MOVIE AND PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER THAT HE GOT SHOT WITH A BOW CASTER WAS EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE AND FUCKED UP AFTER KILLING HIS DAD AND WAS STILL BASICALLY A PADAWAN

KALO IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND COMPLEX VILLAINS STAR WARS HAS HE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS HE'S THE FIRST VILLAIN THAT ACTUALLY HAS AN ARC THAT WE WILL SEE UNFOLD BEFORE YOU GUYS RESPOND VADER HE'S ESSENTIALLY THE EXACT SAME CHARACTER FROM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LAST MINUTES OF EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT HIM DIDN'T COME UNTIL YEARS LATER

PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE I WANT TO SEE DARK SIDE IN TRAINING ETC NOW WE ARE GETTING THAT AND PEOPLE ARE CRYING THAT HE'S NOT THE ALL POWERFUL EVIL

THE PERSON THAT SAID HE'S NOT A GOOD STAR WARS VILLAIN BECAUSE HE IS ACTUALLY INTERESTING AND COMPLEX LOL MORE PROOF THEY'RE JUST CISSY AND WANTED A TYPICAL SATURDAY MORNING CARTOON VILLAIN
BECAUSE COMPARED TO PREVIOUS FORCE USERS HE IS THOSE ARE THE OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC OF CHARACTERS PEOPLE ARE COMPARING HIM TO VADER SIMIOUS OBI WAN ETC COMPARED TO A STORM-TROOPER HE ISN'T
KALO IS GREAT THE ANAKIN WE HAD IN THE PREQUEL

HE IS WEAK MINDED WHICH IS THE POINT I THINK GIVEN HOW STRONG HE IS WITH THE FORCE HE WAS PRETTY SHOCKED WHEN REY DOESN'T BUCKLE WHEN HER MIND IS BEING READ IT HAS ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT HE CAN CUT THROUGH A TOUGH MIND LIKE A HOT KNIFE THROUGH BUTTER WHEN HE FIGHTS RAY HE HAD JUST BEEN SHOT KILLED HIS DAD AND WAS WATCHING HIS PLANET BASE BE DESTROYED

HE IS EMOTIONALLY WEAK IF THAT'S A THING
BECAUSE HE'S PORTRAYED AS WEAK
YEAH HE CAN USE TELEKINESIS SO WHAT THAT DOES NOT MAKE AN INTIMIDATING VILLAIN
YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR PROTAGONIST OVERCOME THE ANTAGONIST IN THE FIRST MOVIE IT MAKES NO SENSE

I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S A PROBLEM THOUGH IT'S FINE FOR KALO REN TO BE WEAK I SEE HIM AS THE THIRD PROTAGONIST
FINN HAS HIS STORY REY HAS HER STORY AND KALO REN HAS HIS
SO IN A SENSE I DON'T THINK KALO REN IS THE TRUE VILLAIN OF THE SEQUEL TRILOGY AT LEAST GOING BY WHAT WE KNOW FROM FFA
I DON'T THINK HE'S WEAK OR AT LEAST NOT WEAK AS A CHARACTER I REALLY LIKED HIM AS A CHARACTER HE AND REY WERE THE BEST PARTS ABOUT FFA BUT AS A CLASSIC VILLAIN HE'S PORTRAYED IN AN INCONSISTENT WAY AND HE LOSES POWER THE CLOSER THE CREDITS ARE WHEN HE APPEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME HE HOLDS A BLASTER BOLT MIDAIR BUT THEN HE FAILS TO READ CONTROL THE MIND OF A USER WHEN WE SEE VADER AND LUKE HAD NO PROBLEMS IN ROTC THEN HE AND PHASMA AND HUX FAILS TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF A CRITICAL PRISONER THEN HE FAILS TO PREVENT ESCAPING FROM ZAKKEU THEN HE HAS HIS MIND READ BY SOMEONE WHO HASN'T RECEIVED PROPER FORCE TRAINING THEN HE'S DEFEATED BY SAID NEWBIE FORCE USER

HIS EMOTIONS WERE BELIEVABLE HIS DIALOGUE WAS DECENT AS A PERSON HE WAS INTERESTING HE'S JUST NOT A GOOD STAR WARS VILLAIN AT LEAST FROM WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN FFA
IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAT A WHINY EMO DOESN'T INSTILL FEAR OR SEEM IMPOSING IN THE LEAST
THIS SOUNDS EXTREMELY SIMILAR TO THE KENOBI NOVEL
KENOBI NOVEL SPOILERS S STORY OF A LONELY SHOP OWNER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TATTOOING DESERT THAT IS BORED OF SERVING MOISTURE FARMERS AND SUBCONSCIOUSLY WANTS MORE FROM HER LIFE ENTER KENOBI OR CRAZY BEN KENOBI AS THE FARMERS SOON CALL HIM HE COMES AT A TIME WHEN ALL THEIR LIVES ARE POISED FOR CHANGE SAND PEOPLE ARE ATTACKING IN FORCE THREATENING THE FARMER S LIFE AND PROPERTY THE FARMERS RESPOND BY CONTRIBUTING TO A PROTECTION FUND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY AN ARMY CALLED THE SETTLERS CALL BUT THE SETTLERS CALL IS A PRETENCE FOR A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE WITH TIES TO PABA THE HUTT NO MATTER THE OUTCOME EVERYONE S LIVES WILL BE CHANGED AND KENOBI IS CALLED ON ONCE AGAIN TO BE THE HERO THE PROTECTION OF LUKE SKYWALKER IS THREATENED WHEN THE SAND PEOPLE REALISE OBI WAN WATCHES THE LARS HOMESTEAD FROM AFAR

I APPLAUD YOUR COMMITMENT TO WRITING BUT URGE YOU TO RECONSIDER THE PLOT FOR THE SAKE OF ORIGINALITY


EH SOUNDS KINDA DUMB
SOUNDS COOL REMINDS ME OF THE STAR WARS COMIC FLASHBACKS
IM FINDING I LOVE THE POLITICAL BOOKS MORE THAN THE ACTION BOOKS IN CANON I LOVED THIS AND BLOODLINE COULDNT GET VERY FAR IN EITHER AFTERMATH OR BATTLEFRONT THE NOVEL

I THINK THIS BOOK WILL ADD SO MUCH TO THE CHARACTERS FOR ME I'LL GO INTO THE SCENE WHERE OLSEN LANDS ON HIDEAWAY PLANET THINKING ON ALL THOSE MOMENTS OF BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO AND WIFE WHILE THOSE WHO HAVEN'T READ THIS WILL HAVE MUCH LESS OF A BACKGROUND
I REALLY LIKE HOW WE HAD ASOKA LAST MONTH WHICH DETAILED GYBER CRYSTALS FROM A PERSPECTIVE AND NOW WE HAVE CATALYST THIS MONTH WHICH DETAILS GYBER CRYSTALS FROM A PERSPECTIVE A MORE SCIENTIFIC ONE AT THAT
ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT CATALYST WAS ITS INSIGHT ON MILITARY POLITICS AND STRUCTURE DURING THE CLONE WARS I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC AND THE EMPIRE WAS PRETTY SUDDEN AND DRASTIC HOWEVER CATALYST SHOWS THAT MUCH OF THE EMPIRE'S STRUCTURE AND POLITICS WAS ALREADY IN PLACE THE DEATH STAR WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION THEY WERE FREQUENTLY USING THE TERM STAR DESTROYER ETC
THE BOOK ALSO SHOWS A BIT MORE OF THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC AND EMPIRE FROM A NON MILITARY VIEW OVERALL THE BOOK PAINTS THE TRANSITION AS MUCH MORE GRADUAL THAN I INITIALLY IMAGINED IT MAKING IT MUCH MORE BELIEVABLE THAT MUCH OF THE GALAXY WAS ON BOARD
I REALLY ENJOYED THEM GOING INTO DETAIL ON THE NATURE OF GYBER CRYSTALS AS WELL AS HOW THE COMMON PEOPLE REACTED TO THE RISE OF THE EMPIRE
I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE MAS ALMEDA PLAY A PART IN THIS IT MAKES ME WONDER IF HE'S THE HOODED FIGURE FROM THE FIRST TEASER
FROM THE STORY SIDE I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT IT ADDED A LOT OF DEPTH TO THE DS AND ITS ORIGIN STORY I WILL DEFINITELY BE GOING INTO ROGUE ONE WITH A CONNECTION WITH THE ERGO FAMILY AND I ANTICIPATE THAT THE ENDING OF CATALYST WILL FLOW PRETTY SEAMLESSLY INTO THE START OF THE MOVIE I'M HOPING THAT HAS MAKES IT INTO THE FILM BUT I'M NOT BETTING ON IT

FROM A LITERARY SIDE I ACTUALLY THOUGHT SOME PARTS WERE KIND OF AWKWARD MOST OF THE CANON BOOKS ARE 3RD PERSON STORYTELLING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ONE CHARACTER OR ANOTHER IN CATALYST THERE WERE A FEW CHAPTERS THOUGH WHERE PERSPECTIVE SHIFTED FROM ONE PARAGRAPH TO THE NEXT AND WE SAW THINGS THAT THE CURRENT SPOTLIGHT CHARACTER DIDN'T KNOW DDK JUST SEEMED LIKE STRANGE WRITING BUT MAYBE I'M JUST NOT USED TO STYLE

ON A BIGGER PICTURE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THIS REALLY ADDED TO THE LEGACY OF THE OLD FILMS IN MY OPINION ON THE OTHER HAND THOUGH I THINK THAT IT SHOWED HOW PAPER-THIN THE STARKVILLE BASE WAS IN FFA IT WAS ONE OF THE FLIMSIEST LEAST INTERESTING HASTILY INSERTED MACGUFFINS I'VE SEEN IN SCI-FI IN RECENT YEARS I LOVE THE MOVIE HATED THE PLOT DEVICE IF THE WRITERS CAN MAKE ME CARE ABOUT KB AS MUCH AS I CARE ABOUT THE DEATH STAR THEN THEY WILL BE JEDI IN MY BOOK AND I'M HOPING THAT THEY CAN
HAVEN'T READ TWILIGHT COMPANY YET BUT I DEFINITELY PLAN TO I LOVED THE POLITICS OF CATALYST JUST BECAUSE OF THE TIME PERIOD EARLY REPUBLIC EARLY SPARK OF THE REBELLION THIS BOOK AND LARKIN REALLY BRIDGES SOME OF THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO ERAS
I READ RECENTLY THAT MADS WORKED WITH A AND CURRENTLY AGED AYN CAN WE ASSUME THEY LEAVE CORUSCANT AROUND AND KRENNIC FINDS THEM AGAIN AT AGE AYN IS AROUND AT THE TIME OF THE MOVIE OR SO I'VE HEARD ARE WE TO ASSUME YEARS PASS IN THE MOVIE ANY INSIGHT WOULD BE APPRECIATED
I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK NOT JUST AS A DISNEY UNIVERSE STAR WARS BOOK BUT AS A STAR WARS BOOK IN GENERAL I KNEW IN MY HEAD THAT I'D BE COMPARING IT TO THE LEGENDS DEATH STAR BOOK THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH AND I HAVE TO SAY IT ACTUALLY MATCHES IT FOR HOW GOOD OF A BOOK IT IS COURSE THIS MIGHT BE BECAUSE IT HAD A FORMER LEGENDS AUTHOR BEHIND THE PEN HE'S HAD A LITTLE MORE EXPERIENCE IN THIS UNIVERSE THAN SOME OF THE NEW DISNEY UNIVERSE WRITERS
I ENJOY HOW THE MAJORITY OF NEW CANON BOOKS ARE SHARING A SIMILAR THEME EXPLORING DESTRUCTION AND OPPRESSION ACROSS THE GALAXY ALL DUE TO THE EMPIRE'S QUEST FOR POWER BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY THE DEATH STAR ITSELF

READING A NEW DAWN ASOKA LARKIN EVEN THE BEGINNING OF LOST STARS WE'RE ALL GIVEN THESE HINTS SOME MORE OBVIOUS THAN OTHERS THAT THE EMPIRE HAS BEEN UP TO SOME TOP-SECRET OMINOUS PROJECT CATALYST HAS KIND OF BEEN THE ICING ON THE CAKE FOR ME SINCE I'VE BEEN ENJOYING THIS OVERARCHING THEME AND STORY OR THE DEATH STAR

ALL OF THE BOOKS I'VE LISTED AND I'M PROBABLY FORGETTING SOME EXAMPLES FEEL AS IF THEY'RE ESTABLISHING A NEW ERA OF CANON ALL CENTERED AROUND THE DEATH STAR AND IT'S CREATION OR COURSE DISNEY LUCASFILM STORY GROUP KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND HAS TIED UP THEIR LITTLE NEW ERA OF CANON WITH ROGUE ONE NEXT MONTH SO I'M LEFT WONDERING WHAT THE FOCUS OF THE NEXT CHAPTER OF CANON NOVELS WILL BE ABOUT
I REALLY WANT TO ENJOY THIS BOOK BUT I'M HAVING TROUBLE GETTING INTO IT VETERAN STAR WARS READER HERE BTW READING CATALYST CHAPTER CURRENTLY DOES IT GET BETTER THE STORYTELLING HAS BEEN FLAT AND GENERALLY QUITE BORING THE CHARACTERS ACT UNFORTUNATELY SHALLOW AS EVIDENCED BY THE LACK OF DIALOGUE LUCENT DEVOTES HIMSELF TO FILLING UP WHITE SPACE WITH CHARACTER BACKGROUND DIRECTLY INSTEAD OF IT COMING OUT THROUGH CHARACTER INTERPLAY AND THE PLOT DEVICES HAVE BEEN PLAIN LAZY THIS IS A DANGEROUS MISSION BECAUSE WE STAND-IN SMUGGLERS MIGHT BE RECOGNIZED OH BUT WAIT ON THIS PLANET WE WILL NEED MASKS TO BREATHE SO THAT MEANS OUR FACES WILL BE COVERED HA GOOD THING THE GUY WRITING THIS CAN MAKE UP WHATEVER HE NEEDS TO MAKE IT WORK WITHOUT HAVING TO BE CLEVER WE'LL BE FINE GENTS I'M OBVIOUSLY EXAGGERATING IN A MOCKING WAY HERE BUT I'VE READ BETTER IN WORK I HAVEN'T READ THE OTHER COMMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID SPOILERS SO APOLOGIES IF THIS FEELING HAS ALREADY BEEN SHARED HOPING YOU ALL CAN TELL ME WHETHER ANY OF THIS IMPROVES CHEERS
I'LL HONESTLY PROBABLY DO BOTH
DON'T NEED TO SOMETHING I'VE HAD MEMORIZED EVERY BIT OF DIALOGUE SINCE
I'LL WATCH BEFORE AND THEN THE OT VII

EDIT AT LEAST TWICE OBVIOUSLY
I'M RE WATCHING I THROUGH VI IN RELEASE ORDER BEFORE AND THEN ANH AGAIN AFTER
AFTER I'M JUST GONNA WATCH THEN SEE AND THEN
I THINK I HAVE SEEN ANH ENOUGH AT THIS POINT
DURING ROGUE ONE
WEEKLY
I'LL WATCH REVENGE OF THE SITH BEFORE AND A NEW HOPE AFTER ROUGE ONE
IVE SCHEDULED MY READING OF CATALYST TO BE FINISHED RIGHT BEFORE I SEE ROGUE ONE WHICH IS WHAT I RECOMMEND EVERYONE WHO HASNT READ IT YET TO DO ITS REALLY GOOD DEPENDING ON HOW THE MOVIE ENDS I MAY WATCH A NEW HOPE JUST TO SEE HOW WELL THE TWO FIT TOGETHER
I WOULD SUGGEST NOT DOING EITHER IF YOU GET INTO THE HEADSPACE OF SCRUTINIZING ALL THE DETAILS OF THE FILMS TO SEE IF THEY MATCH UP PRECISELY YOU'LL HAVE A MISERABLE TIME AT ROGUE ONE THEY'RE FILMS MADE BY ALMOST COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TEAMS FORTY YEARS APART THERE IS GOING TO BE AN UNAVOIDABLE DEGREE OF SLIPPAGE DESPITE EVERYONE'S BEST EFFORTS
DO BOTH MAYBE WATCH IT NORMALLY THE FIRST TIME GO SEE ROGUE ONE AND THEN TOSS ON THE DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY WHEN YOU WATCH IT AFTER OR VICE VERSA
DOING EPISODE GO SEE ROGUE ONE THEN EPISODE
I'D WATCH IT BEFORE AND AFTER TO COMPARE
AFTER
THE PLAN IS BEFORE SINCE I'M TRYING TO GET ONE OF MY FRIENDS TO WATCH THEM AND HAVE TO START AT THE BEGINNING WITH THEM
I WAS GOING TO WATCH IT DURING ROGUE ONE THAT'S ALLOWED RIGHT
YES BEFORE AND AFTER
ANY REALLY ZEALOUS FANS WOULD LISTEN TO THE ENTIRE STAR WARS MINUTE BEFORE PODCAST WHERE EACH DAILY EPISODE IS DEVOTED TO ONE INDIVIDUAL MINUTE OF THE STAR WARS MOVIES IN ORDER BEGINNING TO END
I'M GOING TO WATCH THE FORCE AWAKENS INSTEAD SAME STORY AS ANH BUT BETTER GRAPHICS
I'M DOING A MARATHON WITH MY WIFE FOR THE OT OVER THANKSGIVING AS MUCH AS I LOVE WATCHING THE MOVIES THEY ARE BURNED INTO MY MEMORY SO I CAN PRETTY MUCH WATCH THEM WHENEVER I CLOSE MY EYES IF I WANT

I MIGHT TRY AND READ THE BOOK U BIONICZACK SUGGESTED BUT WE'LL SEE I STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TO BE OPENING NIGHT
I PROBABLY WON'T WATCH IT BEFORE OR AFTER I WATCHED IT AGAIN A FEW MONTHS AGO AND I THINK I'M GOOD THAT BEING SAID I'LL LIKELY WATCH ROGUE ONE FOLLOWED BY ANH WHEN THE COMES OUT
BOTH
NOPE BEFORE
YES YES IS THE ANSWER
BEFORE HERE I GO REMEMBERS EVERY SCENE LINE OF DIALOG MOMENT IN ANH THAT WAS GREAT NOW READY TO SEE ROGUE ONE
PROBABLY ANH RIGHT BEFORE I WANT TO GET ANY SUBTLE REFERENCES AND CONNECTIONS I THINK I'VE JUST ABOUT MEMORIZED IT BY NOW BUT ILL ALWAYS GIVE MYSELF AN EXCUSE TO WATCH IT AGAIN
I'M THINKING 2 ROGUE ONE THEN BUT I DO LIKE THE MACHETE ORDER SO IF I GO THAT WAY I'D WATCH 2 ROGUE ONE THEN

I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER FANS OF MACHETE ORDER WANT TO WEIGH IN ON WHERE ROGUE ONE WOULD FIT POSSIBLY EVEN FIRST

EDIT I AGREE WITH U COCOBANDICOOT OF GOING WITH ORDER
RO IV V II III VI VII
I'M NOT GOING TO RECATCH IT AS I WANT ROGUE ONE TO STAND ALONE
ANH AND TURKEY DAY
I'M PLANNING ON WATCHING THE CLONE WARS EPISODES WITH SAW GERAERA BEFORE HAND BUT I'M SURE I'LL WATCH A NEW HOPE AS WELL
I RECENTLY REMATCHED AURALNAUTS STAR WARS EPISODE LASER MOON AWAKENS DOES THAT COUNT
I RECATCH ANH IN MY HEAD EVERY DAY
AFTER PROBABLY RIGHT AFTER I'LL WATCH REVENGE OF THE SITH HERE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS THEN WHATEVER EPISODE S OF REBELS AIRS BEFORE ROGUE ONE THEN I'LL WATCH ROGUE ONE FOLLOWED BY A NEW HOPE
I REALLY HOPE THEY DO A DOUBLE SHOWING WITH ANH RIGHT AFTER IN THEATRES
I'M GOING WITH AFTER I WANT TO BE ABLE TO VIEW THE EVENTS OF THAT MOVIE WITH THE ADDED CONTEXT OF WHAT HAPPENS IN SHOULD ADD SOME INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE

I DONT SEE THE BENEFIT OF WATCHING IT BEFORE
I WATCH A FILM FOR XMAS THEN COME BACK HOME AND WATCH THE BEST SEQUEL EVER MADE TAKE A BREAK THEN WATCH THE BEST SEQUEL EVER MADE THEN I WILL WATCH AN OKAY SEQUEL WITH A KICK ASS CLOSING ACT THEN AN OKAY REHASH SEQUEL
FOR EPISODE I WATCHED EVERYTHING IN ORDER BOY HOWDY DOES EPISODE MAKE SO MUCH MORE SENSE IF YOU WATCH THE CLONE WARS CARTOON I WATCHED REBELS THAT WAS AVAILABLE I KNOW REBELS TAKES PLACE BEFORE ROGUE ONE AND I FEEL LIKE THEY SAID THAT THE MAIN GUY BEHIND IT WAS IN TALKS WITH THE MAIN STAR WARS WRITING TEAM I'M JUST HOPING BEFORE ROGUE ONE THAT REBELS LEADS UP TO THOSE EVENTS SOMEHOW IT HAS TO BE BLOODY THERE'S NO OTHER CONCLUSION
AFTER I'VE ALREADY SEEN ANH VERY RECENTLY AND POSSIBLY AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE I'LL HAVE NO NEED FOR REFRESHERS HOWEVER I MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SEEING ANH AFTER BECAUSE ROGUE ONE TAKES PLACE MINUTES BEFORE ANH CIRC
POR QUE NO LOS DOS
NEITHER IVE SEEN IT A THOUSAND TIMES I DID READ THE CATALYST BOOK THOUGH
I'M PROBABLY GONNA WATCH REVENGE OF THE SITH BEFORE ROGUE ONE
I'VE WATCHED IT SO MANY TIMES IT'S ALWAYS PLAYING IN MY HEAD SO BEFORE
YES
VI VQGSO
AFTER IT'LL PROBABLY GIVE THE STORY ARC A SENSE OF FINALITY AND I'LL HAVE A BETTER APPRECIATION OF WHAT WENT ON BEFOREHAND AS THEY BLOW UP THE DEATH STAR
ONE THING THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME IS WATCHING ROTS BEFORE IT FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER THIS WILL PLAY AS A PREQUEL TO ANH OR ACTUALLY MORE LIKE SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL TO IT BUT NOT REALLY A SEQUEL TO ROTS IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE
BOTH PROBABLY
PLAN TO WATCH IT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
I'M WATCHING THE PREQUEL AND MAYBE REBELS THEN I'M GOING TO SEE THE MOVIE THEN I'LL CONTINUE FROM THERE
AFTER
IF ROGUE ONE REALLY SUCKS I'LL WATCH IT AFTER TO GET THE BAD TASTE OUT OF MY MOUTH I HAD TO WATCH THE OT IN A ROW AFTER FFA TO GET THAT BAD TASTE OUT TOO
I'VE BEEN WATCHING A NEW HOPE BEFORE IT WAS CALLED A NEW HOPE SO BE AND WE ALREADY KNOW THE ENDING OF ROUGE ONE
IVE DECIDED TO NOT WATCH ROGUE ONE
I IMAGINE THEY FASTEN A COUPLE OF MSE DROIDS TO THEIR FEET AND USE THEM AS ROLLER SKATES
METERS PER SECOND
ABOUT THIS FAST
THIS FAST
WALK AS FAST AS YOU CAN THAT'S HOW FAST THEY CAN MOVE
WHAT THE HELL THIS LOOKS SO OFFICIAL YOU DO IT DID YOU DO THE PACKAGING DESIGN TOO

IF I HAD SOMEONE MAKE ME SOMETHING SO UNIQUE AND AMAZING I'D BROLLY CRY THIS IS AMAZING WORK MATE
NOW WE NEED ALL THE ET GALACTIC SENATORS
VERY CREATIVE
THE INCONTINENT ALIEN

ET PEE OH
I THINK IT SHOULD BE NAMED PO TO BETTER REFLECT THE STAR WARS ROBOT NAMING SCHEME OTHER THAN THAT ITS BLOODY FANTASTIC SUPER IMPRESSIVE WORK
I WANT A CUSTOM DARTH BEVAN
SOMEONE SHOW THIS TO STEVE ZARAGOZA IMMEDIATELY
AM I THE ONLY GUY SEEING THIS AND THINKING ABOUT LUCIO FROM OVERWATCH SAYING YEAH THIS IS MY JAM
IT'S BEEN DONE

LIST FACEBOOK D AID
I JUST THREW UP
ETO IS WHAT I SAY WHEN I THINK I'VE RUN OUT OF TOILET PAPER THEN REALIZE THERE'S A ROLL ON THE BACK OF THE TOILET
JUST IMAGINE IF ONE WAS CALLED DOMINATOR

HONESTLY WRITERS HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING DON'T REALLY THINK THERE IS ANY DEEP MEANING HERE
I THINK WITHIN MINUETS MOST OF THE GA IS GOING TO FIGURE OUT THIS IS TAKING PLACE BEFORE EP
NO NEED FOR A CRAWL MARVEL MOVIES DON'T HAVE PARAGRAPHS EXPLAINING WHEN AND WHERE THE MOVIE IS TAKING PLACE BESIDES A BACK DROP AND SETTING WILL BE EXPLAINED IN SOME WAY EITHER A COOL TWIST ON A CRAWL OR A MONOLOGUE
PEOPLE ARE BUYING WAY TOO MUCH INTO THE NOTION THAT PEOPLE WILL BE SUPER CONFUSED AND NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IT WILL BE FINE
IT'S TAKEN FROM OLD SERIALS

I'M PRETTY SURE THE PREQUEL DOESN'T FIT IN THE EMULATING THE FEEL AND STYLE OF OLD SERIALS THEY'RE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE OT AND THE STREET SO BASED ON THAT ARGUMENT DON'T REALLY SEE WHY WOULD NEED A CRAWL

AND YES YOU CAN EXPLAIN YOUR AUDIENCE ABOUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITHOUT EXPOSITING THINGS
FANTASTIC BEASTS IS DOING PRETTY WELL AND THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN OPENING CRAWL MAYBE AUDIENCES AREN'T DUMMIES
WHILE I'D PREFER A CRAWL JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN IN EVERYTHING STAR WARS I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY NECESSARY IT MAY BE SAD TO SEE IT OMITTED BUT I DON'T HONESTLY THINK IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE SHOULD GET TOO UPSET ABOUT JUST HOPE THE FILM ITSELF IS GOOD
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WE NEED A CRAWL OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT WOULD IT EVEN SAY THE ENTIRE RO FILM IS IN THE OPENING CRAWL OF ANH
DID YOU EVER NOTICE THAT NEARLY EVERY MODERN MOVIE DOESN'T HAVE A TITLE CRAWL EXPLAINING THINGS FAST FURIOUS DIDN'T HAVE A TITLE CRAWL TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED AFTER FAST FURIOUS CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR DIDN'T HAVE A TITLE CRAWL TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED AFTER WINTER SOLDIER OR AGE OF ULTION FANTASTIC BEASTS DIDN'T HAVE A TITLE CRAWL TO EXPLAIN THAT IT'S A HARRY POTTER MOVIE BUT NOT ABOUT HARRY POTTER

AUDIENCES WILL FIGURE IT OUT AND THOSE THAT DON'T A TITLE CRAWL WOULDN'T HELP THEM ANYWAY HELL THE LACK OF A TITLE CRAWL WILL DO ENOUGH TO TELL PEOPLE IT'S NOT A NORMAL STAR WARS MOVIE

2 WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF STANDALONE MOVIES THEY PLAN TO MAKE IN THE FUTURE BUT BASED ON THE TWO WE KNOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW THEY ARE SEPARATE FROM THE SAGA FILMS SO LET'S NOT TRY AND SAY THEY MIGHT MUDDY THE WATERS BETWEEN THE TWO WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE OF THAT HAPPENING
NO CRAWL MOVE ON
I'M OKAY WITH NO OPENING CRAWL ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME OPENING THAT THEY USED FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ROGUE ONE PANEL AT SCE
MY COMMENT FOR AN EARLIER POST

I AM ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT STRONGLY AGREE THIS SHOULD HAVE A TRADITIONAL OPENING CRAWL I ACTUALLY DID MY PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT SPEECH FOR MY PUBLIC SPEAKING CLASS ON THIS VERY TOPIC LAST WEEK MY THREE MAIN TALKING POINTS WERE EUPHORIA HISTORICAL AND CLARITY

EUPHORIA I THINK THIS IS OBVIOUS FOR MANY STAR WARS FANS

HISTORY LIKE YOU SAID BOOKS HAVE THEM EVEN THE NEW ONES AND SO DOES EVERY VIDEO GAME I CAN THINK OF AND THAT IS A LOT OF THEM

CLARITY HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU SEE CONFUSED ABOUT WHEN THIS MOVIE TAKES PLACE AND WHY IS DARTH VADER IN IT OR WHAT ABOUT REY AND FINN THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE CASUAL VIEWERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE CONFUSED
A WIZARD A PIRATE A PRINCESS AND A STRONGMAN
IT'S SO COOL TO SEE THINGS LIKE PICTURES LIKE THIS SURFACE AFTER ALL THIS TIME IT'S FASCINATING SEEING WHAT SCENES COULD HAVE MADE IT INTO THE MOVIE BUT WERE CUT
I CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THEM WHISTLING NONCHALANTLY
COOL STILL I NEVER KNEW ABOUT THIS SCENE IT REALLY WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE THOUGH CONSIDERING THAT BARKEN PUT ALL SECTIONS ON ALERT AND JUST FOR HOW OUT OF PLACE THEY LOOK
REMINDS ME OF BLUE HARVEST
SOURCE
REMIND ME AGAIN WHY THEY ABANDONED THEIR STORM-TROOPER DISGUISES
HELLO THERE FELLOW IMPERIALS GOSH IT SURE IS GREAT BEING AN IMPERIAL ISN'T IT ISN'T IT A FINE IMPERIAL DAY
DIEGO LUNA ON THE FAR LEFT
A REMNANT OF THIS SCENE STILL REMAINS CHECK THE FIRST OR SO FRAMES OF THE SCENE WHERE LEIA GOES YOU CAME IN THAT THING YOU'RE BRAVER THAN I THOUGHT
I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH HOW APHRA SURVIVED GETTING SHOT INTO SPACE BY VADER
WHY THE SPOILER TAGS FOR THE NEW SERIES IT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED ALREADY SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY A SECRET THAT CHARACTER HAVING THEIR OWN SERIES DOESN'T EVEN REALLY SPOIL ANYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE
I WONDER HOW LONG BEFORE THE WARS COMIC BUMPS UP TO EMPIRE AND WHAT THEY WILL DO AFTER THAT TIME JUMP
I WAS TOTALLY INTO THESE LEADING UP TO FFA AND INTO MAYBE MARCH AFTER THAT I HAD TO LAY OFF BUYING UP EVERY SINGLE ONE AND DARTH MAUL IS THE FIRST THING THAT LOOKS INTERESTING IN A WHILE
GREAT A NEW DARTH MAUL SERIES S
HERE'S HOW HE LOOKED IF HE HAD NEVER TURNED TO THE DARK SIDE
BASED ON WHAT WE SEE FROM OTHER SITH I IMAGINE IT'S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT HE WOULD STILL WEAR ROBES OR A CAPE A MASK IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION PROBABLY LOTS OF BLACK PROBABLY A RED SABER HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE AS BIG OTHERWISE HE MAY NOT LOOK THAT DIFFERENT
PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE THIS
I SAY HE WOULD LOOK LIKE HE DID IN ROTS WHEN HE HAD THE YELLOW EYES THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS HE WOULD HAVE A RED LIGHTSABER ALL BLACK ROBES AND MOST LIKELY A NEW HAIRSTYLE MAYBE A BUZZ CUT OR JUST SOMETHING NOT AS LONG
I KNOW I'VE SEEN IMAGES LIKE THIS KEEP DIGGING
IT WOULD INTERESTING TO SEE IF HE WOULD LOOK ANY DIFFERENT OR WHAT THE DIFFERENCES WOULD BE BUT ASIDE FROM A RED LIGHTSABER I THINK HE WOULD MOSTLY LOOK LIKE HE DID AT THE END OF ROTS HE MAY ADD THE CAPE BUT I DON'T THINK SO
HERE YOU GO HETP
DONE AND DONE

I ALSO TOOK A STAB AT IT

WITH SOME TEXT ADDED IN

NO TEXT AT ALL
HERE IS A HI RES SOURCE IF ANYONE WANTS TO DO IT FOR THAT ROGUE ONE COVER HETP
ALL I SEE IS REBEL PROPAGANDA
I FOUND THIS ON ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY S TWITTER
I LIKE HOW HELMET IS LESS SHINY TO MATCH EP IV BUT WHERE'S HIS SILVER CHEEK
I THINK THEY ARE TELLING US THE SHE IS SECRET SISTER COUSIN
SOMEONE WAS REPAINTING STORM TROOPER ARMOUR AND ACCIDENTALLY FLICKED THE BRUSH IN DIRECTION
THE REFLECTION IN EYE LOOKS LIKE HE'S STARING AT A PIRATE SHIP
THANKS FOR MAKING THIS THREAD OP NOW I HAVE A NEW AWESOME WALLPAPER HETP
FROM THE THUMBNAIL I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A PICTURE OF DARK HELMET
R PHOTOSHOPREQUEST
THE MARKETING FOR THIS FLICK REALLY SEEMS TO BE PUSHING VADER AS A MAIN SELLING POINT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL WALK AWAY DISAPPOINTED IT APPEARS HE WILL ONLY BE IN THE FILM BRIEFLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRAILERS AND LISTEN TO THE NEWS DISCUSSIONS FROM THE FILM I HOPE I'M WRONG THO
MORE AND MORE I'M FAVORING THE REBELS VERSION OF HELMET OVER THE FILM VERSION
I KEEP THROWING MONEY AT MY SCREEN YET I STILL HAVE NO TICKETS
REMOVED
ANYONE ELSE KINDA IRRITATED BY HER I'M REALLY HOPING VADER CATCHES HER AND TEARS HER A NEW ONE
I THINK ROGUE ONE IS OVER RATED
WONDER WHAT ELSE IS CUSTOMIZED

THRAWN AND THIS TURBOLASER CONTROL STATION IS GOING TO BE REMOVED

PELLATION WHAT WILL TAKE ITS PLACE

THRAWN MY DRUM SET
IT ACTUALLY APPEARS IN IRON SQUADRON IF YOU TURN THE BRIGHTNESS ALL THE WAY UP
LOOKS LIKE AN ED HARDY T-SHIRT TO ME
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING A TEENAGER FROM WOULD DO TO THEIR MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE
OH MAN THIS IS AWFUL LOOKS LIKE A CHEAP TRIBAL TATTOO FROM THE ABSOLUTELY TASTELESS AND IT DOESN'T FIT INTO THE ICONIC DESIGNS OF THE STAR WARS SAGA
MAN I DO NOT LIKE THIS THRAWN ISN'T THE KIND OF EGOTIST TO NEED THIS KIND OF POINTLESS DECORATION AT LEAST IT'S A NORMAL STAR DESTROYER AND NOT SOME KIND OF GOOFY SUPER SHIP WITH SPIKES ALL OVER
BADASS AF

SO IF THIS IS SHIP DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CAPTAIN PELLATION
THAT'S BRILLIANT ALSO EXPLAINS WHY THE EMPIRE DIDN'T PAINT THEIR SHIPS AND JUST LEFT THEM GREY EMPIRE WAS ABOUT FUNCTION AND UTILITARIAN USAGE NO PERSONALITY IT'S LIKE SEEING A ROLLS ROYCE PIMPED OUT SOMETHING IS JUST NOT QUITE RIGHT THAT BEING SAID I LOVE THE SENATORS
I THINK PEOPLE THAT HATE IT ARE MISSING THE POINT

THRAWN LOVES ARTICLE HE USED ART TO PICK APART HIS ENEMIES HE HAS AN OVERWHELMING APPRECIATION FOR ARTICLE

SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THIS ART SAY ABOUT THRAWN WHAT IS THE FORESHADOWING HERE HOW IS THRAWN EXPRESSING HIMSELF HOW WOULD THRAWN PICK THIS PIECE APART TO OVERWHELM HIS ENEMY

ITS FILION TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THRAWN SOMETHING THAT ONLY THRAWN CAN DO

THIS SEEMS LIKE EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING THE CHARACTER WOULD HATE COMBINE THIS WITH HIS SUPER SINISTER DELIVERY AND IT'S KINDA LIKE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THRAWN IN THE SHOW

IT'S ALL JUST A BIT GAUCHE ISN'T IT
THE TATTOO ON THAT STAR DESTROYER IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY
NEVER KNEW THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE DESIGNS ON THEM

INTERESTINGLY IN HEIR TO THE EMPIRE ONE OF MEN REPORTS THAT THE CHIMAERA WAS TOO FAR AWAY FOR ITS NAME TO BE READ OFF THE SIDE ZHAN TOOK A GUESS ABOUT THAT FEATURE OF A STAR DESTROYERS AND WAS WRONG

THIS IS WAY COOLER
THRAWN IS SUCH A BADASS THAT HE CAN GET CUSTOM PAINT JOBS A KILOMETRE LONG
OH COOL A STAR DESTROYER WITH A BAD TATTOO
THIS IS TACKY AS HELL

AND WHILE IT HASN'T ACTUALLY BEEN NAMED YET I'D PREFER THIS NOT BE THE CHIMAERA

WE DON'T HAVE TO SPLURGE ELEMENTS OF THE THRAWN TRILOGY OUT IN ONE GO LET'S ALLOW A LITTLE DEVELOPMENT THE LONGER WE WAIT FOR THE MOMENT WHERE THRAWN TAKES COMMAND OF THE CHIMAERA THE MORE SATISFYING IT WILL BE
NO ONE ELSE HAS BROUGHT IT UP BUT I THINK THAT THE CORRECT SPELLING IS CHIMAERA
YUCK I PREFER MY STAR WARS TO BE FREE OF DOUCHE TRIBAL TATOOS OR TERRIBLE AFFLICTION T-SHIRT DESIGNS WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
AM I THE ONLY ONE THO LIKES IT
SOURCE
I QUIT WATCHING REBELS AFTER SEASON 2 I PERSONALLY FOUND IT UNINTERESTING I LOVED HEIR TO THE EMPIRE WILL THRAWN MAKE THE SHOW WATCHABLE FOR ME
IS THAT SUPPOSE TO BE A 2 HEADED SARLAC

I WOULD SAY A CHIMAERA BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE A CHIMAERA

WHATEVER IT IS IT'S FUCKING AWESOME
I DONT LIKE THE PAINTED OVERLAYS AND MARKINGS IN REBELS THEY LOOK VERY CHEAP AND NOT RELATED TO THE SW STYLE GREAT SERIES BUT THAT PART REALLY ISNT VERY GOOD INO
WAIT ARE THEY ACTUALLY NAMING IT THE CHIMAERA THAT'S AWESOME

AS OTHERS HAVE SAID HIS EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAD BETTER BE ONE GILA PELLATION
NOT ENOUGH FLAME EMODINS
I THINK THE PAINT SCHEME IS UNNECESSARY
AND ON THE NEXT EPISODE OF PIMP MY RIDE
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS
VIN DIESEL CALLED AND HE WANTS HIS TATTOO BACK
COOL WE'VE RUINED GRAND ADMIRAL THRAWN CAN THEY JUST UNCANONIZE HIM AGAIN
HOLY FUCK THAT LOOKS AWESOME

WAY COOLER THAN I IMAGINED BY READING THE BOOKS
LOOKS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS I HOPE SHIT LIKE THIS NEVER MAKES IT TO THE MOVIES
I REALLY LOVE HOW SUCH A UNIQUE DESIGN THIS IS AND ESPECIALLY THAT IT'S ON THE EMPIRE SIDE THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING SPECIAL
OH MY

WELL IF THEY WERE EVER GOING TO PAINT A STAR DESTROYER THIS WOULD BE THE GUY THEY DO IT FOR
I THINK THE ADMONITOR WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER FIT WITH THE BLUE HUE IT HAD BUT I'M OKAY WITH THIS TOO
KINDA UGLY
I'M REALLY TRYING BUT THIS FAN FICTION SHIT IS WHY I NEVER LIKED THIS CHARACTER IN THE OLD CANON
NOT SURE IF THIS IS REALLY COOL OR REALLY STUPID
WHAT IS THE CHIMAERA WITHOUT JORUMS AND PELLATION

IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A GUY ON THE TOP SITTING AT A DESK
I DOUBT THE IMPERIAL NAVY WOULD ALLOW THIS GAUDY CUSTOMIZATION AND THAT THRAWN WOULD WANT IT TO BEGIN WITH
I LIKE IT I'M ANXIOUS TO HEAR THE RATIONALE BEHIND IT I'M SURE WE WOULD HEAR THRAWN EXPLAIN THE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE THAT THIS DESIGN HAS ON SOME SYSTEM AND HOW IT FITS INTO THINGS I'M INTRIGUED
MPH LOOKS LAME AND POINTLESS AND NOT IN LINE WITH HIS PAST EU CHARACTERIZATION
THIS IS REALLY BADASS I PREFERRED A FULLY CUSTOM DESIGNED SHIP BUT THIS IS AWESOME ENOUGH
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD I NEED THIS
FUCKING BADASS
IMAGINE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A STAR DESTROYER RHODA THUNK
REALLY A FUCKING TRIBAL TATOO


SNOKE IS AKU CONFIRMED
WELL IN THE NEW CANON IT'S BEEN SHOWN PLENTY OF PLACES PRE DISNEY
YES I LOVE THAT THE CHIMAERA IS STILL IS FLAGSHIP ANY HOPE FOR GILA PALLATON BEING BROUGHT BACK I LOVED HIM IN THE EU
WHY WOULD THIS BE NSF
I JUST PISSED MYSELF AT HOW AMAZING THIS IS
I SURE HAVE ALL I WANNA KNOW IS WHEN I CAN BUY MY TICKETS
YUP STOPPED WATCHING TRAILERS AFTER THE SECOND ONE AND NO LONGER LOOK AT ANY RO POSTS NOT GOING SO FAR AS LEAVING THE SUB THOUGH IT'S BEEN EASY ENOUGH TO AVOID THINGS HERE
IN THE BIBLE NAHUM I REFRESH THE LEAKS SUB LIKE TIMES A DAY
I'M NOT TOO WORRIED I'LL LIKELY READ A COUPLE OF REVIEWS BEFORE HAND ANYWAY SO IT'S NOT LIKE I WOULD BE GOING IN BLIND I WON'T ACTIVELY SEEK OUT ANY PLOT POINTS BUT IF THEY GET SPOILED IT'S NO BIG DEAL
NUMBER SPOILERS DON'T CHANGE MY MOVIE EXPERIENCE I SAW THE SPOILER FOR FFA AND I STILL ENJOYED THE MOVIE
ME PROBABLY SHOULD STEER CLEAR OF ANY POSSIBLE LEAKS UNTIL I SEE THE MOVIE

ME TO ME WHAT'S ONE LEAK GONNA DO

ME I JUST WANT TO PLAY IT SAFE

ME TO ME DIDN'T KNOW YOU WAS A BITCH

ME CONTINUES READING LEAKS
I'M STILL GOING TO FREQUENT ALL THE NORMAL PLACES I WASTE MY TIME ON BUT AS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T GENERALLY GO ON TWITTER FACEBOOK WHERE THINGS ARE SHOUTED OUT AT RANDOM I'M NORMALLY PRETTY GOOD AT NOT GETTING SPOILED BECAUSE OF FINALS I WON'T SEE THE MOVIE FOR A FEW DAYS SO IT'LL BE SKETCHY BUT I'M NOT SUPER WORRIED
NOT FOR A FEW MORE WEEKS ONCE THE PEOPLE IN EUROPE START SEEING IT THEN I'LL START BEING CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT CORNERS OF THE INTERNET I EXPLORE
STRONG AM I IN THE FORCE BUT NOT THAT STRONG
IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME I'M WAY TOO FAR DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE
YOU'LL STILL FIND SPOILERS I SAW THAT A CHARACTER WAS KILLED BY ANOTHER CHARACTER IN IN A YOUTUBE COMMENT FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNRELATED
I HAD VII SPOILED BY OPENING STEAM NEWS FEED NO INTERNET FOR ME FROM RELEASE TILL I SEE IT
NAH NOT REALLY I JUST WON'T PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION BUT WON'T GET MAD IF I GOT SPOILED

THEN AGAIN I JUST DON'T MIND SPOILERS IN GENERAL I WON'T SEEK THEM OUT BUT I DON'T THINK THEY RUIN THE EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A SHOW OR A MOVIE
I ONLY WATCHED THE FIRST TRAILER I'M GOING IN TO THIS ONE BLIND
I'M GOING DARK A WEEK BEFORE THE RELEASE NO REVIEW SITES NOTHING OF COURSE THAT HASN'T WORKED FOR ME IN THE PAST BECAUSE FACEBOOK FRIENDS LOVE TO SHARE REVIEWS WITH BOLD TITLES LIKE WASTED OPPORTUNITY AND WORST MOVIE EVER
I HAVE STOPPED FOLLOWING R STARWARD JUST IN

SHIT
LIKE WITH MARVEL MOVIES I'M NOT WATCHING THE ALMOST DAILY SERIOUSLY CIVIL WAR HAD MORE THAN AND EACH ONE HAD AT LEAST A NEW SCENE

I ALREADY HAVE MY TICKETS FOR THE ON THE OR SO I WILL UNSUBSCRIBE THIS SUBREDDIT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS
I AM GOING TOTALLY DARK THIS TIME LAST YEAR FOR FFA I MADE THE MISTAKE OF GOING ON FACEBOOK FOR A BIT AND SAW SOMEONE POST A PICTURE OF HANS DEATH SCENE IN A POST THAT WAS UNRELATED TO STAR WARS I WAS LIVID I'VE STOPPED WATCHING THE TV SPOTS AND ANYTHING ELSE AFTER SEEING THAT EXTREMELY SHORT CLIP OF THE DEATH STAR FIRING IN THAT INTERNATIONAL TRAILER
NOT SURE GOING TO FINISH THINKING ABOUT PICKING UP THIS WEEKLY
NOPE AFTER LAST TIME I'M NOT EVEN RUSHING TO SEE IT
I'VE BEEN DARK SINCE THE 2ND TRAILER I WANNA READ THE CATALYST BOOK BUT I'LL WAIT UNTIL I'VE SEEN THE MOVIE I HAVE MY TICKETS BOOKED AND I AM EXCITED
I MEAN YOU KIND OF ALREADY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
NOT GONNA GO OUT OF MY WAY TO AVOID THEM BUT I'LL STICK TO NOT WATCHING ANY MORE TRAILERS OR CLICKING ANY MORE NEWS STORIES ABOUT IT
I ALWAYS SAY I'M GOING TO AVOID SPOILERS BUT I HAVE ZERO SELF CONTROL I COMPLETELY RUINED FFA FOR MYSELF LAST YEAR SO I'M ACTUALLY DETERMINED TO GO DARK THIS TIME ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M SO EXCITED FOR ROGUE ONE I THINK I'LL TAKE A BREAK FROM STAR WARS FORUMS AND NEWS SITES AROUND DECEMBER AND THEN COMPLETELY SHUT OFF EVERYTHING ON THE JUST IN CASE I RUN ACROSS AN UNWANTED DETAIL

FOR ME SPOILERS AREN'T THE BIG PROBLEM IT'S THAT I HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THESE MOVIES SO IF I READ STUFF BEFORE AND FIND OUT THAT SOMETHING I REALLY WANTED TO HAPPEN WAS CUT OUT OR DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN AT ALL THEN I GO INTO THE MOVIE ALREADY PREJUDGING IT
I GOT FFA RUINED FOR ME SO I'M DEFINITELY TRYING TO GO DARK I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING GREAT AT IT SO FAR
HAVEN'T WATCHED THE RECENT TRAILERS
I'M NOT WE KNOW HOW IT ENDS ALREADY LEIA GETS THE PLANS AND LUKE BLOWS UP THE DEATH STAR
IT ALREADY FEELS LIKE AGES SINCE I READ THIS BOOK DON'T RECALL ANY MESSAGES BUT I'M GUESSING YOU MAY BE TALKING ABOUT MESSAGES FROM HAS SO THEY COULD COORDINATE THE EROS ESCAPE FROM CORUSCANT

THE LARKIN STUFF I DO RECALL THOUGH SINCE I'VE BEEN CONFUSED ABOUT THAT MYSELF EVEN THOUGH THE MISSION IN LARKIN SEEMS LIKE IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE AND VADER REALLY INTERACT THE LARKIN NOVEL ACTUALLY DOES SAY THAT THEY'VE WORKED TOGETHER IN SMALLER CAPACITIES BEFORE SO CATALYST ISN'T WRONG TO SAY THEY'VE GONE ON MISSIONS TOGETHER

IF YOU REALLY WANT A CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS THOUGH LARKIN DOESN'T GET THE EXECUTRIX UNTIL THE END OF THE LARKIN NOVEL EVEN THOUGH HE'S IN POSSESSION OF IT IN CATALYST WHICH TAKES PLACE PRIOR TO IT
THAT'S A GOOD POINT IT MIGHT JUST A POTHOLE FOR THE TIMELINE OR MAYBE KRENNIC IS JUST WRONG HE WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT RUMORS AFTER ALL

2 MY GUESS FOR WHO WAS SENDING THE MESSAGES WAS EITHER BAIL ORGANA OR MON MOTHMA OR AT LEAST SOMEONE ON THEIR ORDERS BUT NO THEY NEVER OUTRIGHTLY SAY WHO WAS LEAKING INFO TO LYRA BUT THEN AGAIN THEY NEVER LEAK ALL THAT MUCH INFO
WOW I HAD TO LOOK THAT UP NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE I LIVE NEAR RALEIGH NC AND WE HAVE AN IMAX BUT THAT'S ABOUT AS MUCH AS I'VE SEEN IN THE US NOT SURE HAS MADE IT'S WAY TO THEATERS

NOW AT DISNEY AND UNIVERSAL THEY HAVE THE SHOWS BUT I CAN'T EVEN DO 3D AS I GET MOTION SICK AND MIGRAINES SO I'LL TAKE MY ROGUE ONE ETC ON AS BIG A 2D SCREEN AS I CAN FIND
DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE FOR SALE YET
SORRY COULDN'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS MYSELF BUT HERE'S A PIC
SINCE THIS TAKES PLACE SO CLOSE TO A FILM MADE IN DID YOU TRY INJECT A LITTLE S INTO YOUR PERFORMANCES
ASK THEM TO GIVE THEIR PERSONAL RANKING OF ALL PREVIOUS STAR WARS MOVIES
HOW

BUT ANYWAY

WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT ROGUE ONE NEEDS TO ACCOMPLISH IN ORDER TO PAVE THE WAY FOR MOVIES THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM ANY CONNECTIONS TO THE SAGA FILMS SEEING AS ROGUE ONE IS A COMBINATION OF NEW CHARACTERS AND STORY WITH AN EXISTING PROMINENT STORY AND CHARACTERS
WHY DID EACH OF THEM CHOOSE TO AUDITION FOR ACCEPT THE JOB TO BE IN A STAR WARS FILM
ENTERPRISES
BOBA FETT IS SNOKE CONFIRMED
I LIKE HOW THAT IS BASICALLY NOTEPAD
WHAT EPISODE I'M JUST NOW WATCHING THE EPISODES IN SOUTH THAT ONE OF THE SW REBELS WRITERS WROTE
JACK BAUER
I THINK I ACTUALLY REMEMBER SEEING THIS BACK WHEN WAS
I WONDER HOW MANY DIGITS A STORM-TROOPER CAN HAVE IN HIS OR HER SERIAL NUMBER IF MY BACK OF NAPKIN MATH IS RIGHT IS AROUND POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS AND THERE ARE BOUND TO BE MORE STORM-TROOPER THAN THAT THERE'S JUST ON EACH STAR DESTROYER
NEVER PUT THAT MUCH THOUGHT INTO IT BUT IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY IN SWBFII ALL STORM-TROOPER HAD A NAME THAT STARTED WITH EITHER FN OR TK IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY
CIRC IN BEFORE THE AWAKENING YOU LEARN THAT FN S ENTIRE UNIT IS A UNIT OF AND THEY ASSIGN EACH OTHER NICKNAMES BASED ON THEIR NUMBERS EVERYONE HAS ONE EXCEPT FOR FINN BECAUSE HE'S DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER STORM-TROOPER IN HIS UNIT BUT PHASMA REFERS TO THEM STRICTLY BY THEIR NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE REAL NAMES
WATCH THE HOLIDAY SPECIAL YOU WILL LEARN LOADS ABOUT THE WOOKIEE FAMILY
THERE IS A DECENT AMOUNT STUFF FROM WOOKIEE CULTURE THAT OCCURRED IN THE FIRST KOROR GAME WHEN YOU GO TO KASHYYYK YOU COULD TRY AND HAVE HIM READ UP ABOUT THE STORY FOR THE GAME SINCE IT TALKS ABOUT THE FAMILIAL TIES AND THE SOCIETAL STUFF FOR THE WOOKIEES
IF YOU HAVE TIME TO READ A NOVEL THE BOOK AFTERMATH LIFE DEBT TALKS ABOUT IT OTHERWISE YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE WOOKIEEPEDIA ARTICLE HERE AND HERE
HI MY NAME IS JOBACCA AND I AM A WOOKIEE I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HELP WITH YOUR SONS PROJECT LIKE MOST I HAIL FROM THE FOREST WORLD OF KASHYYYK WHILE OUR CULTURE MAY SEEM PRIMITIVE WE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED WE JUST CHOOSE TO LIVE AMONG THE TREES AND EMBRACE THE SPIRITS OF NATURE LIKE HIPPIES

AS EVIDENCE OF OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WHILE YOU HUMANS ARE JUST NOW LEARNING AND ENJOYING THE VARIOUS PLEASURES OF VR THE WOOKIEES OF KASHYYK HAVE HAD THIS TECHNOLOGY SINCE AT LEAST THE LATE S WE OFTEN RELAXED AMONG OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY DURING THE WOOKIEE HOLIDAY KNOWN AS AND ENJOYED THE HOLOGRAPHIC MUSIC OF JEFFERSON AIRPLANE LAME INTERGALACTIC AND OTHER MORE VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCES ALSO BOBA FETT CARTOONS WHICH WERE ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD FOR THE TIME AND BUDGET THEY WERE PRODUCED WITH

HAVE A STRICT CODE OF HONOR UNLESS WE DONT WE REALLY DONT KNOW WHAT IS AND ISNT CANNON ANYMORE AND HOPEFULLY THE UPCOMING YOUNG HAN SOLO MOVIE WILL EXPLORE THIS ISSUE IN MORE DEPTH ONE OF OUR CHIEF EXPORTS IS CORN OR AS THE INDIANS CALLED IT MAIZE IN ANY CASE LIKE MYSELF ENJOY A RICH CULTURE AND OUR PLANET IS A PLANET OF CONTRAST THANK YOU
WOOKIEES CELEBRATE A THING CALLED LIFE DAY IT'S KINDA LIKE CHRISTMAS THERE'S A HOLIDAY SPECIAL WITH FAMILY CELEBRATING LIFE DAY BUT I ADVICE YOU IF YOU EVER WATCH IT YOU'RE GONNA NEED LOTS OF COFFEE


WATCH FROM
GO TO WOOKIEPEDIA AND READ THE LEGENDS PAGE ABOUT BOOKIES IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED
MAYBE TOO MUCH FOR AGE LOL I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS ANYMORE LOL BUT WOOKIEE SLAVE LABOR SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT THAT IS CLEARLY RELEVANT TO THE WORLD

OTHERWISE I FEEL LIKE THAT'S INDIAN LEARNING AGE AND AS FAR AS I KNOW THE TOTALLY HAVE TRIBAL CULTURE AND STUFF LIKE THAT WHICH IS RELATABLE
IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY CANON ANYMORE BUT THE FIRST BOOK IN THE THRAWN TRILOGY GOES HEAVILY INTO BOOKIE CULTURE
WELL FIRST WOOKIEE HAS TWO E'S IN IT

SECOND HERE'S A GOOD STARTING POINT
WHAT THE HELL IS A BOOKIE
JUST LOOK UP STAR WARS POSTER ON EBAY I HAVE THE POSTER ON MY WALL I LOVE WORK
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENED TO U WILLIAMSHATNER ONCE

OH AND JOHN LITHGOW
HOW YOU LIKING THE JOHN CLEESE BOOK
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT
SHOULD HAVE ADDED A GREMLIN
GREMLINS
THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE WING
FOR DROID NOT BEING CHOPPER S
THAT IS GREAT
THIS IS RAD I'M CURIOUS WHAT DID YOU USE TO MAKE THIS
HEY SO STUPID QUESTION HOW DID YOU DO THIS
AWESOME BY THE WAY


MY CONDOLENCES FOR HAVING TO FLY UNITED
WHEN THE X WINGS COME OVER THE HORIZON WITH THE WAKES OF WATER SHOOTING UP

IN THE THEATRE I LITERALLY WENT YEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH

FINN FOAH THATS ONE HELL OF A PILOT

ME FUCK YEAH

I ALMOST CRIED IN THAT THEATRE
I PREFER THE

MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BEING A CYNICAL BASTARD BUT THE INTRODUCTION TO THE FALCON FELT MUCH MORE LIKE HEY GUYS LOOK WHAT WE BROUGHT BACK WHERE AS THE COMING IN OVER THE WATER WAS A REALLY COOL SCENIC BATTLE SHOT
WHEN HAN SAYS IT'S THE RESISTANCE I STILL GET CHILLS NO CLUE WHY IT'S SUCH AN AWESOME MOMENT
AWESOME PILOTING AND TIE FIGHTER KILLS IS MY FAVORITE PART OF TO ME THAT ONE SCENE ENCOMPASSES WHAT STAR WARS IS ALL ABOUT OR AT LEAST WHAT WATCHING STAR WARS FEELS LIKE OFCOURSE THERE'S THE MYTHOLOGY AND TONS OF OTHER ELEMENTS WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE BUT THE SCORE FINN CHEERING HIM ON AND THE TRADITIONAL WOOHOO JUST MADE IT SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH GET CHILLS EVERYTIME
I LIKED THE PART WITH THE SOCCER BALL ROBOT
THE IS MY FAVORITE PART ON RECATCH BUT ON INITIAL SCREENING THE FALCON WAS THE BEST

I WAS AT A SCREENING ON THE PREMIERE DATE SO NOTHING WAS SPOILED THE CROWD WENT ABSOLUTELY APESHIT WHEN THE FALCON CAME ON SCREEN IT BEEN THE BIGGEST CHEER OUTSIDE OF THE OPENING TITLE SPLASH



THE HAN CHEWIE WE'RE HOME MOMENT PROBABLY BEEN BIGGER IF IT HADN'T BEEN IN SO MANY OF THE TRAILERS
CHILLS AND TEARS
FOR ME IT WAS WHEN LUKE WAS SHOWN
BOTH SHOTS WERE MOVING BUT THE FALCON WAS THE BEST
I CHEERED FOR THE FALCON THE FIRST TIME I WAS GRINNING EAR TO EAR THE FIRST TIME AND STILL GET CHILLS FOR THE
HEARING MEMORABLE MUSIC IN A MOVIE IS ALWAYS A REFRESHER JOHN WILLIAMS WORK ALWAYS HIS CLOSE TO HOME
FOR ME IT WAS THE FALCON THE DOESN'T HAVE ITS OWN MUSIC CUE
THE BEST PART ABOUT THE FIRST TIME WE SEE THE FALCON IN FFA IS THAT IT'S THE SECOND TIME WE SEE HER THE CAMERA HAD PREVIOUSLY PANNED ACROSS HER WHILE FINN AND REY ARE RUNNING FOR THAT OTHER SHIP BUT IT WAS SO QUICK MOST PEOPLE I ASSUME MISSED IT

EDIT HERE
I WAS GRINNING THE ENTIRE MOVIE BUT THE PART THAT GAVE ME THE MOST CHILLS WAS WHEN THE FALCON WAS REVEALED
LOOKS IN A FOWL MOOD
IMPRESSIVE MOST IMPRESSIVE
LOL THAT IS THE BEST ONE OF THOSE I HAVE EVER SEEN
NICE WE ALMOST DID SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS BUT SHE WENT WITH AN ANGRY BIRDS THEME INSTEAD LOL
CAREFUL WITH BLASTER A LOT OF SCHOOLS NOW-A-DAYS ARE RETARDED WITH THAT CRAP
I FEEL LIKE HE REALLY MISSED A DARTH NIHILS OPPORTUNITY HERE
IF ONLY MY SCHOOL WAS BASED ON PROJECTS OF DISGUISING TURKEYS
HE WASNT A SEPARATIST HE WAS AN OPPORTUNIST WHO FORESAW THE FALL OF THE JEDI AND WANTED TO JOIN THE DARK SIDE BEFORE THINGS GOT BAD HE JUST WANTED TO BE ON THE WINNING SIDE
MY FAVORITE PART IS THE VERY END WHEN FIVES SAYS WE DID IT WE'VE CAPTURED THE CAPITOL AND REX JUST SIGHS AND SAYS WHAT'S THE POINT OF ALL THIS

IT REALLY HITS HARD BECAUSE AFTER FIVE SEASONS OF THE SHOW COUNTLESS BATTLES AND HUNDREDS OF DEATHS NEITHER SIDE SEEMS TO BE WINNING AND IN THE END WE ALL KNOW THE WAR AMOUNTED TO NOTHING AS BOTH THE SEPARATISTS AND THE REPUBLIC LOST REX JUST LOOKS SO DEFEATED AND TIRED OF FIGHTING THAT YOU REALLY FEEL FOR ALL THE CLONES
CARDCASES DEATH WAS SO WELL DONE LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY BROTHERS
I LOVE READING POSTS BY PPL WHO RECENTLY DISCOVERED ACW THAT SHOW MADE STAR WARS INFINITELY BETTER FOR ME
KRELL WASN'T A SEPARATIST HE WAS A VERY SMART GENERAL AND FORSEE THAT JEDI AND THE REPUBLIC WILL LOSE THE WAR AND SOMETHING NEW WILL COME GALACTIC EMPIRE THAT'S WHY HE WENT TO THE DARK SIDE
I WAS WONDERING IF IT WOULD BE IN THE MOVIE I GET THE REASONING BEHIND IT IT'S NOT REALLY AN OFFICIAL EPISODE
I DON'T REALLY MIND EITHER WAY BUT I GUESS YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE COMICS AND GAMES OPEN UP WITH A CRAWL AND THEY AREN'T SAGA FILMS EVEN SO I'M FINE WITH THIS BUT I DO THINK THERE SHOULD PROBABLY BE SOMETHING TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT ERA THIS IS AS THERE'S STILL PEOPLE WHO AREN'T REALLY SURE WHAT ROGUE ONE IS
THIS IS GREAT NEWS AND I'M GLAD THEY HAVE SAID SO BEFORE THE FILM

I REALLY HOPE THAT ACTUAL TITLE ON SCREEN WILL BE JUST ROGUE ONE

I LIKE THE A STAR WARS STORY BRANDING IN THE MARKETING BUT JUST ROGUE ONE ON SCREEN WOULD BE VERY CLASSY
WHY FORGET THE CLONE WARS MOVIE
AS LONG AS IT HAS AT LEAST ONE WIPE I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS
WILL THIS MEAN THE OPENING SHOT WON'T BE ON A SHIP ABOVE A PLANET THESE ARE THE REAL QUESTIONS
OH WOW I KIND OF ASSUMED THEY WOULD ALL HAVE THEM
GOOD STUFF KEEP THE CRAWL FOR THE SAGA EPISODES
I'M FINE WITH THIS
GOOD
THIS IS AWFUL EVERY STAR WARS MEDIA HAS HAD CRAWLS WHETHER IT BE BOOKS OR COMICS OR VIDEO GAMES IT'S WHAT MAKES STAR WARS UNIQUE AND ROGUE ONE HAVING A CRAWL IS ESSENTIAL I KNOW THEY WANT THE WHOLE THIS ISN'T AN EPISODIC FILM VIBE BUT THE CRAWL ISN'T THAT THE FILMS ARE ABOUT THE A FORCE AND THE SKYWALKERS WHICH ROGUE ONE DOES NOT FOCUS ON AT ONE BUT WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO HAVE A CRAWL
ABY LAO

DID A SMALL EDIT HETP HOPE THAT'S OKAY
MANUAL I WAS TRYING TO TELL MYSELF MY EPISODE III OBI WAN WOULD BE ENOUGH
I JUST SEE VADER ARE WICKED PARTICULAR
CAN CONFIRM THAT IS VADER

SOURCE THIS PICTURE
I HONESTLY DONT EXPECT VADER TO DO ANYTHING PHYSICAL IN THIS MOVIE EXCEPT CHOKING KRENNIC

I SEE EVERYONE IS EXPECTING HIM TO GO AND KILL EVERYONE BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT ALL WE HAVE SEEN FROM VADER WHEN IT COMES TO PICTURES AND TRAILER IS HIM TALKING BASICALLY BEING LIKE A LEADER LIKE PALATINE IN THE OT BASICALLY

THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT THE JEDI OR SITH SO I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE A SMALL ROLE I FEEL LIKE IF YOU EXPECT HIM TO DO SOME CRAZY SHIT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED
SOMETHING LOOKS OFFICIAL HIS NECK HAS A GAP OR HAS THAT ALWAYS BEEN THERE AND HIS SUIT LOOKS JUST OFF
I'M ALL FOR CANON ACCURACY AND MAKING HIS COSTUME LOOK LESS SHITTY THAN IN ANH PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT IN DAYS
AREN'T THEY OVERUSING DARTH VADER IN THE LATER PROMOTION MATERIAL I FEEL LIKE SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WALK OUT OF THE MOVIE DISAPPOINTED
I NEED THIS IN AHQ
YEAH BACK
NOOOOOOOO THE ROBE IS UNDER THE CHEST PIECE WHYYYYY
PERHAPS THEY CAUGHT THIS MISTAKE ABOUT THE ROBES AFTER FILMING AND HAVE FIXED IT IN POST NOT UNLIKE ADDING KALO HELMET TO SCENES THAT WERE FILMED WITHOUT IT IN FFA I'M HOPING THIS REALLY SHOULDN'T BOTHER ME AS MUCH AS IT DOES

THE OTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS THE COSTUME CHANGING FROM ROTS TO ANH AND THEN AGAIN IN ESB ROTC MAYBE HE JUST HAS NEW SUITS CONSTANTLY BEING CREATED AND IMPROVED UPON OR MAYBE HE'S SUPERSTITIOUS AND HE TRIED THE ROBES OVER ONE DAY THEN THE DEATH STAR GOT BLOWN UP AND HE NEVER WENT BACK TO IT
WHO'S PLAYING VADER IN SUIT
UGH I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO STAY TRUE TO THE CLASSIC FORM BUT THERE ARE AT LEAST SOME MINOR TWEAKS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO UPDATE THE CHARACTER NOT BIG DESIGN CHANGES BUT JUST SEAMLESS TRANSITIONS BETWEEN MATERIALS AS IF HE WAS ACTUALLY A CYBORG WITH A CAPE AND ROBE ON AND NOT A HUMAN WEARING A CYBORG WITH ROBE COSTUME

I DO CRINGE A LITTLE BIT WHEN SEEING THE LIGHT AND ROCKER SWITCH DESIGNS BUT AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO STAY ORIGINAL
LOOKS YOUNGER I THINK
LOOKS WEIRD JUST LIKE IT DID IN EPISODE OH WELL NOT FOR ME ANYWAY
I HOPE AN ALYS THROUGH THE OPEN
AND HERE'S A SIMILAR EDIT OF AS MUCH OF THE SPACE BATTLE AS I COULD FIND TURNS OUT TWO SHOTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN USING LOOK LIKE THEY MIGHT BE PART OF ONE LONGER SHOT SEE AT THE THE END OF THE LOOP WITH A SMALL JUMP WHERE THE MISSING FRAMES GO

I'LL ADMIT THAT SOME OF THE FIRST SECOND TRAILER CGI HAD ME A BIT WORRIED BUT THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME I'M GLAD TO BE PROVEN WRONG
AR AR AR AR AR
I LOVE THE SENSE OF PLACEMENT THESE SHOTS HAVE GARETH EDWARDS IS GREAT FOR THAT EVEN IF IT'S A QUICK CUT OR A LONG CUT THERE'S ALWAYS A SENSE OF PLACEMENT AND FOCUS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN 3D SPACE AUTOMATICALLY THAT'S THE SIGN OF A DIRECTOR WHO WANTS YOU TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE MEANT TO KNOW NO SHAKY CAM TO OBSCURE THE IDEAS HE'S A CONFIDENT GUY AND THAT'S GREAT TO SEE ESPECIALLY IN HIS THIRD FLICK
DAMN THIS MOVIE LOOKS GORGEOUS THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY IT'S SHOT THAT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK FAMILIAR YET REALLY NEW I CAN'T REALLY PUT MY FINGER ON IT MAYBE IT'S JUST GARETH EDWARDS STYLE BUT IT JUST FEELS LIKE WE'RE SEEING THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE FROM AN ANGLE WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE I GOT A SIMILAR FEELING IN FFA DURING THE FALCON CHASE ON ZAKKEU
I'M PRETTY SURE THERE IS A SHOT YOU MISSED OF A CLOSE UP OF THE GUN SHOOTING AT THE AT LEGEND

EDIT HERE YOU GO YOU MIGHT WANT TO EDIT THIS IN
FLYING AROUND DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF AN GUNS SEEMS LIKE A BAD IDEA BUT I GUESS IT MOSTLY WORKED FOR THE SNOWSPEEDERS
AWESOME HOW THE SIDES OF THAT IN THE BACK ARE COMPLETELY OPEN
AS A CHILD OF THE S I GREW UP ON THE VHS BOX SET I'M OT TO THE CORE THE PT WASN'T BAD BUT IT JUST NEVER HAD THAT OT MAGIC FOR ME EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN FROM ROGUE ONE MAKES ME THINK IT WILL BE THE BEST STAR WARS FILM YET I GET CHILLS FROM ALL THE MEDIA RELEASED SO FAR THE COMBINATION OF OT AESTHETICS AND MODERN FILM MAKING TECHNOLOGY IS AWESOME
GOD DAMN I WANT TO BE A DOOR GUNNER WHEN I GROW UP
THAT LOOP IS REALLY ENTRANCING I PROBABLY SPENT OR MINUTES JUST LETTING IT PLAY
HEY THAT'S COOL NICE WORK
DOING GODS WORK
ONE MINUTE

STAND UP

HOOK UP
IS THAT AN ION CANNON MOUNTED ON THE LOOKS LIKE IT BASES ON THE COLOR OF IT'S BLASTER FIRE
NEXT YOU SHOULD TRY TO PIECE TOGETHER SPEECHES
SO I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE VISUALS OF THIS SHOT BUT I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN HAD THIS BEEN IN A PREQUEL IT WOULD BE BASHED INCESSANTLY FOR OVERUSE OF CGI BECAUSE NOT A BIT OF THAT IS A MINIATURE OR OTHERWISE REAL AGAIN THOUGH I'M FINE WITH IT JUST SOMETHING I NOTICED
WOW WELL DONE CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THIS PART
LOOKS LIKE A VIDEO GAME CUTSCENE
THERE WILL WITHOUT A DOUBT BE A JUMP IN TIME WE WILL PROBABLY GET THE OPENING SCENE WITH REY AND LUKE THEN IT WILL JUMP WHY DO I THINK SO

REY WILL PROBABLY GET SOME TRAINING AND STUFF WITH LUKE WE DONT NEED TO SEE EVERYTHING

2 FINN IS BADLY INJURED AND NEEDS TO RECOVER

KALO IS ALSO BADLY INJURED AND NEEDS TO RECOVER

THE ONLY REASON THERE IS NO JUMP IN TIME IN THE BEGINNING IS PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY ARE SETTING UP A I AM YOUR FATHER SCENE

THE REASON I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE ARIAN JOHNSON SAID HE HAD NO IDEA HE WAS BREAKING A LONG-STANDING TRADITION BY NOT JUMPING FORWARD SO HE JUST WROTE WHAT HE THOUGHT TO WRITE HE DIDN'T COME UP WITH SOME CONVOLUTED PLOT JUST SO WE CAN HAVE A TIME JUMP WHICH DOESN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING I DON'T LOVE LUKE AND HAN AND LEIA FOR ALL THAT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN BETWEEN THE MOVIES I LOVE THEM BECAUSE OF THE MOVIES
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION FOR EXAMPLE THERE COULD STILL BE A GAP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE WHICH CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY EASILY I HIGHLY DOUBT THEY WILL DO IT BUT IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO I'M TRUSTING THAT THEY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD PLAN PUT TOGETHER FOR IT
I QUITE LIKE IT MAKES THE TWO MOVIES A BIT MORE CONNECTED
THE CRAWL TEXT WILL BE INTERESTING WHAT CAN THE TEXT EXPLAIN THAT AIN'T SUPER LAZY REY MEET HER FATHER ON THIS ABANDONED JEDI TEMPLE OR THINGS WE ALREADY KNOW
JUST MAKE IT LIKE DEATHLY HOLLOWS PART AND 2
AS FAR AS BEING BELIEVABLE AND NATURAL I THINK THAT THAT DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE WRITING THIS NEW STORY CAN BE JUST FINE ALBEIT WITHING A TIGHTER TIMEFRAME
I AM TOTALLY OK WITH IT FOR THIS TRILOGY I THINK THEY HAVE A GRAND PLAN AND REALLY HOW THE HELL DID IT TAKE YEARS TO FIND HAN AT PALACE THEY KNEW WHERE HE WAS GOING THE WHOLE TIME
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ISN'T TRADITION BUT DOING WHAT'S BEST FOR THE STORY THERE WAS A BIG TIME JUMP AFTER TPM AND ANH BECAUSE THEY WERE MORE INTRODUCTIONS THE SEQUELS JUMPED RIGHT INTO THE CORE CONFLICT ROTC HOWEVER DOESN'T START ALL THAT LONG AFTER EMPIRE BECAUSE EMPIRE ENDED WITH THE CHARACTERS IN A REALLY CONFLICTED INTERESTING PLACE

FFA LIKE EMPIRE ENDS WITH ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS SPREAD APART REY IS AWAY CONFRONTING LUKE WHOSE CURRENT STORY IS A COMPLETE MYSTERY FINN IS UNCONSCIOUS KALO IS WOUNDED AND IN TRAINING IT WOULD BE LAME AND A DISSERVICE TO THE STORY WERE THE SEQUEL TO SKIP PAST THE RESOLUTION TO ALL THOSE CONFLICTS HAD FFA ENDED WITH AN AWARD CEREMONY THERE WOULD HAVE LIKELY BEEN A TIME JUMP
I REALLY HOPE THERE'S AT LEAST SOME KIND OF IMPLIED TIME GAP MAYBE SUGGESTING THAT REY HAS BEEN ON THE ISLAND TRAINING WITH LUKE FOR MONTHS IT WOULD GIVE FIN AND KALO THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAL AND DEVELOP AS CHARACTERS AND COULD PROVIDE A MORE INTERESTING POINT FOR THE STORY TO JUMP OFF OF
MY GUESS IS THAT WE MIGHT SEE THE IMMEDIATE FOLLOW-UP OF REY LUKE FINN HEALING UP WITH POE AND LEIA AND RECOVERY BUT THAT THE MOVIE WILL SKIP AHEAD SEVERAL MONTHS TO WHERE REY HAS SOME TRAINING KALO HAS LEARNED UNDER SNOKE AND FINN IS A FULL FLEDGED MEMBER OF THE RESISTANCE REPUBLIC NAVY WITH POE

I'D LIKE TO HAVE SEEN THEM STICK TO TRADITION AND HAVE A TIME JUMP BUT LIKE YOU SAID AFTER THE DRAMATIC ENDING OF FFA IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE IT WOULD PICK UP RIGHT AFTER THAT SO EVEN THOUGH I'D LIKE IT IF THEY HAD STUCK TO TRADITION IT'S REALLY JUST A NITPICKING ISSUE IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IF THE MOVIE IS STILL GOOD

BUT I DO HOPE THEY RETURN TO HAVING A TIME GAP FOR IX EVEN IF IT'S ONLY A BRIEF GAP
I'M NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF TIME JUMP I'M WONDERING WHAT THE TIME JUMP WAS FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF STAR KILLER AND REY FINDING LUKE THEY DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH ON IT IN THE MOVIE BUT I DOUBT THAT REY IMMEDIATELY TOOK OFF TO FIND LUKE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME PASSED FROM REY HUGGING LEIA TO HER FINDING LUKE AT THE END I THINK THERE WILL HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TIME PASSED TO EXPLAIN FINN AND RECOVERY AND TO STILL HAVE NO TIME PASS FROM THE LAST SCENE IN THE MOVIE TO THE NEW ONE
I'D SAY THAT THE MOVIE STARTS OUT WITH THE FIRST ORDER REGROUPING AFTER THE EXPLOSION OF STARKVILLE BASE THEN THERE IS A TIME JUMP TO REY AND LUKE TRAINING
CLONE WARS CHRONOLOGY IS A LITTLE WEIRD THERE ARE TWO EPISODES BEFORE THE MOVIE THEN THE REST OF THE SERIES IS AFTER IT THIS IS THE ULTIMATE ORDER WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
YES THE MOVIE IS ACTUALLY JUST THE FIRST FOUR EPISODES OF THE SERIES MERGED INTO ONE FULL-LENGTH FILM IT'S JUST AN EXTENDED PILOT

BE WARNED HOWEVER THE CLONE WARS MOVIE IS GENERALLY REGARDED TO BE THE WEAKEST LINK IN THE SAGA IT'S A VERY POOR PRECEDENT TO THE REMAINDER OF THE SERIES IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE MOVIE GIVE THE SERIES A TRY

IT JUST GETS BETTER AS IT GOES ON
THERE ARE A FEW EPISODES IN THE SERIES BEFORE THE MOVIE
CLONE WARS MOVIE THOUGH THE SERIES I KNOWN TO BE OUT OF ORDER SO I PREFER CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER BUT YEAH MOVIE FIRST

ALTHOUGH IF YA WANNA FIT BOTH CLONE WARS CARTOONS TOGETHER IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THE FIRST SOMETHING EPISODES THEN ALL OF 3D CLONE WARS THEN THE REST OF 2D CLONES WARS THEN EPISODE
AY THIS IS REAL CHILL MAN THX FOR SHARING
I DUG IT REMINDED ME OF SOME OLD SNEAKER PIMPS THANKS FOR SHARING
LOVE THE BEATS KEEP UP THE AWESOME WORK
I ALSO MAKE BEATS AND LOVE SW MY FRIENDS AND I MOSTLY DO AND OR FUTURE SOUND STUFF FOLLOWED YOU ON SC AND SHOWED SEVERAL BUDDIES AND EVERYONE FUCKS WITH IT GREAT SOUND MAN
I THINK I WOULD PREFER A BOOK OR COMIC MINISERIES
NAH THERE IS ONE ROBOT CHICKEN MADE IT ALREADY
NO THANK YOU MOVE THE STORY FORWARD
THE BOOK PLAGUERS COVERS THIS REALLY WELL ALBEIT NOT FROM PALATINES POV BUT IT STILL SHOWS HIS MOTIVATIONS FOR DOING WHAT HE DOES VERY WELL
NOPE
I COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE
NOPE
PEOPLE SEEM TO NEED A REMINDER OF THE RULES

RESPECT FELLOW REDDITORS

NO SEXUALIZATION OF PEOPLE OR CHARACTERS
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A BADLY PHOTOSHOPPED HAND COMING OUT OF THE CARBONITE TRYING TO ATTACK YOU
I HOPE YOUR FRIEND KEEPS THE STATUE IN THEIR ROOM SO THEY CAN TURN OVER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SEE HARRISON FACE AND REMEMBER THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE ALRIGHT
NOT THE CARBONATE
I JUST REALIZED MY PHONE AUTOCORRECTED CARBONITE TO CARBONATE WELL THAT'S EMBARRASSING
THIS LOOKS FAMILIAR BY CHANCE WAS THIS AT BASH OF THE EMPIRE IN ATLANTA
FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT THAT YOUR FRIEND WON A COPLAY COMPETITION COSPLAYING AS FROZEN HAN I IMAGINED HIM HOLDING THAT FACE WHILE YOU WHEEL HIM AROUND A CONVENTION AND IT MADE ME SMILE

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED JEDI
JESUS THAT EXCITES ME

THE IDEA OF HAVING A LIFE SIZED HAN IN CARBONATE WOULD MAKE ME THE ENVY OF MY FRIENDS

MY F WOULD HATE IT THO
YOU LOOK COOL

THE PHOTOGRAPHER THOUGH SHOULD HAVE NOTICED IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A HAND COMING OUT THE CARBONATE THAT'S ON THEM NOT YOU
SO THAT SHIRT OR DRESS OR WHATEVER YOU'RE WEARING IS AWESOME WHERE DID YOU GET IT IF I WANTED ONE
CAN YOU POST A PIC OF JUST HIM
TRYING SUCCEEDING

FAFFY
I'D JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT CARBONATE AND CARBONITE AREN'T THE SAME THING
IS THAT A DEATH STAR ROMPER THAT'S AELLA SWEET
OH SHIT YOUR ARMS FLOATING
GREAT POSE ALONG WITH HAN BUT THE HAND FELT OUTTA PLACE I GUESS THE LIGHT RUIN IT

I GET IT COPLAY OF BURN NOTICE STAR WARS FIONA HAS TO TRICK ABBA AND GET HAN BACK THAT'S WHY THE BARGE BLEW UP SO EASILY ON TATTOOING YOU KNOW HOW FIONA PUTS TOO MANY EXPLOSIVES

HOKEY RELIGIONS AND ANCIENT WEAPONS ARE NO MATCH FOR A GOOD BLASTER AT YOUR SIDE KID HETP
DELETED
I SPENT FAR TOO LONG TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THERE WAS A LEFT HAND AND FOREARM JUST HANGING IN THE AIR
MY DUMB ASS THOUGHT THERE WAS A RANDOM FLOATING FOREARM AND HAND
FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS I THOUGHT IT WAS A YOUNGER VERSION OF BASTIA SALELE SHAN FROM TOR
I THINK YOU WIN AT BEING COOL
YOU LOOK LIKE SPENCER FROM PRETTY LITTLE LIARS
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS COOL


2 YOUR POSE IS AWESOME I WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT YOU LOWER YOUR ELBOW A LITTLE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THAT'S WHY HALF YOUR ARM IS MISSING

VADER BEGINS LOOKING AT OTHER PATHS

ART BY THE ILLUSTRIOUS U JORYMO

OUR HAPPY EMPIRE

OUR HAPPY EMPIRE 2


HEH OLD REPUBLIC NAVY LOVE IT
LAZER MOON
AHA I'M LOVING THESE KEEP EM COMING
I'M GLAD THAT THESE ARE A RECURRING THING
THIS REMINDS ME OF STAR WARS DETOURS WITH THE SPACE MALL BIT
DESPERATELY SEARCHES FOR A WAY TO FOLLOW SPECIFIC USERS
DARTH MAUL SHOULD RUN THIS PLACE
I ABOUT DIED LAUGHING AT THE DRAWING OF THE MALL STAR
MINOR NERD ALERT THE SENATE WAS DISSOLVED IN SW IT DIDN'T EXIST AFTER THE BATTLE OF BAVIN UNLESS THE SENATE STARTED WORKING AGAIN BEFORE ROTC
IS VADER GOING TO RENAME HIMSELF TO REGIONAL MANAGER VADER BY ANY CHANCE REALLY GETTING AN AURALNAUTS LAZER MOON VIBE FROM THIS THOUGH THAT ISN'T A BAD THING
AAPSS
THOSE SCIENTISTS ARE DEAD FOR SURE NO DOUBT
THE FIRST HALF WAS INCREDIBLE MY FAVORITE PART WAS CATALYST SPOILER S WHEN THE ERGO FAMILY WERE SPARED DEATH BY BATTLE DROIDS DUE TO THE SHUT DOWN COMMAND
MORE THAN ANYTHING CATALYST MADE ME DISLIKE THE STARKVILLE BASE THINK ABOUT THIS THE DS CLEARLY TOOK A MONUMENTAL EFFORT THAT HAD TO BE UNDERTAKEN IN MAXIMUM SECRECY FOR YEARS ON END ON THE OTHER HAND KB POPPED OUT OF NOWHERE AS IF EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED THAT THE FIRST ORDER HAD IT I KNOW SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF AND ALL BUT KB WAS WAY MORE OF AN UNDERTAKING THAN THE DS EVER WAS

ON TOP OF THAT WITH ROGUE COMING UP WE CAN SEE HOW THE DS WAS SUCH A FLASH POINT IN THE PLOT IT BROUGHT THE CHARACTERS TOGETHER AND SERVED AS A GREAT MACGUFFIN KB ON THE OTHER HAND SEEMS LIKE A CHEAP DEVICE INTRODUCED HALF WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE THERE'S NO STORY BEHIND IT NO DRAMA WHAT ARE ALL ALLS THOUGHTS

LOVED THE RIVALRY AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LARKIN SEEKING PRESTIGE THROUGH SUPPORTING THE EMPIRE AND KRENNIC SEEKING POWER AND GLORY

I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE THIS IS THE END OF THE STORY FOR THE ELDER AND ITS JENS STORY NEXT ROGUE ONE ITS ALSO AN EPILOGUE CHAPTER AND EPILOGUES SOMETIMES DO THINGS LIKE THIS

DEDICATION

STILL AT GEOGNOSIS WITH SENTINEL BASE BEING A HALF-WAY CHECKPOINT YOU HAVE TO HIT BEFORE GOING THERE THIS IS WHERE LARKIN IS STATIONED IN PREVIOUS CANON NOVEL LARKIN WHICH TAKES PLACE CHRONOLOGICALLY AFTER THIS BUT DOESN'T INVOLVE THE DEATH STAR

I LOVED IT MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE CANON NOVEL TO DATE BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OUT YET AND I HAVEN'T READ ASHOK YET
JUST THOUGHT OF ANOTHER QUESTION SO WHERE DID THE ORIGINAL DEATH STAR PLANS COME FROM THAT WHOLE SUBPLOT WITH BOGGLE THE LESSER CONFUSED ME HE SAID THE PLANS CAME FROM COUNT DOOK

SO WHO ACTUALLY HAD THE ORIGINAL IDEA THEN AND WE'RE THE SEPARATISTS ACTUALLY BUILDING A BATTLE STATION
REALLY ENJOYED THE BOOK SERVED AS A GREAT TRANSITION AND GAVE A LOT OF GREAT INFO FOR THE TRANSITION OF THE REPUBLIC TO THE EMPIRE

I LOVED THE FIRST HALF BUT THE SECOND HALF SEEMED TO LOSE PACE AND MEANDER A BIT SEEMED UNFOCUSED ON WHAT IT THE CENTER OF THE STORY WAS BUT THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS RECOVERED NICELY

OVERALL A GREAT SET UP FOR ROGUE ONE
I FINISHED IT LAST NIGHT AND I REALLY LOVED IT IT MAY BE MY FAVORITE BOOK SO FAR IN THE NEW CANNON I LOVED KRENIK AS A CHARACTER AND IT DID A GREAT JOB OF MAKING IT BELIEVABLE THAT GALEN AND HIS FAMILY COULD BE MANIPULATED WITHOUT THEM KNOWING I'M KIND OF SAD THAT WE PROBABLY WON'T BE SEEING MORE OF GALEN OR KRENIK OUTSIDE OF THIS BOOK AND THE MOVIE

MY MAIN COMPLAINT IS THE ENDING IT'S TOO NEAT TOO NICE TOO HAPPY KRENIK GETS DEFEATED ALL OF THE MAIN CAST AND MAIN SUPPORTING CAST SURVIVES IT'S TOO FRIENDLY EVEN HAS LIVES HAPPILY EVER AFTER AT THIS POINT THE EMPIRE IS BECOMING ITS STRONGEST AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS HOPEFUL AS IT IS
LOVED THE BOOK VERY FOND OF GALEN LYRA AND SAW PRETTY SURE ROGUE ONE IS GONNA GUT ME
REALLY ENJOYED THE BOOK I LOVED KRENNIC CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM IN LIVE ACTION HIS RIVALRY WITH LARKIN IS FUN AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH DEVELOP

IT WAS FUN TO HAVE A BOOK THAT WILL BE SO RELEVANT TO LIVE ACTION MEDIA OR SEEMS LIKE IT WILL VS THE SIDE STORIES THAT HAPPEN BETWEEN EVENTS OF THE MOVIES THE ACTIONS TAKEN IN THIS BOOK WILL AGAIN HOPEFULLY MAKE WAVES IN ROGUE ONE AS FAR AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE DEATH STAR AND PLACE IN THE EMPIRE
I REALLY WANT TO ENJOY THIS BOOK BUT I'M HAVING TROUBLE GETTING INTO IT VETERAN STAR WARS READER HERE BTW READING CATALYST CHAPTER CURRENTLY DOES IT GET BETTER THE STORYTELLING HAS BEEN FLAT AND GENERALLY QUITE BORING THE CHARACTERS ACT UNFORTUNATELY SHALLOW AS EVIDENCED BY THE LACK OF DIALOGUE LUCENT DEVOTES HIMSELF TO FILLING UP WHITE SPACE WITH CHARACTER BACKGROUND DIRECTLY INSTEAD OF IT COMING OUT THROUGH CHARACTER INTERPLAY AND THE PLOT DEVICES HAVE BEEN PLAIN LAZY THIS IS A DANGEROUS MISSION BECAUSE WE STAND-IN SMUGGLERS MIGHT BE RECOGNIZED OH BUT WAIT ON THIS PLANET WE WILL NEED MASKS TO BREATHE SO THAT MEANS OUR FACES WILL BE COVERED HA GOOD THING THE GUY WRITING THIS CAN MAKE UP WHATEVER HE NEEDS TO MAKE IT WORK WITHOUT HAVING TO BE CLEVER WE'LL BE FINE GENTS I'M OBVIOUSLY EXAGGERATING IN A MOCKING WAY HERE BUT I'VE READ BETTER IN WORK I HAVEN'T READ THE OTHER COMMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID SPOILERS SO APOLOGIES IF THIS FEELING HAS ALREADY BEEN SHARED HOPING YOU ALL CAN TELL ME WHETHER ANY OF THIS IMPROVES CHEERS
LIVED WITH A MANIPULATIVE FRIEND FOR A YEAR WHO ALWAYS HAD AN EXCUSE BEFORE YOU EVEN CALLED HIM OUT ON ANYTHING GOD LUCENT NAILED IT WITH KRENNIC
I LIKE THE ROCKY TEXTURE
YOU REBEL SCUM FEEL THE WRATH OF THE EMPIRE
R STARWARSTATTOO
FINALLY A NICE TATTOO

THANK YOU FOR NOT DOING THE WEIRD HALF AND HALF LOGO
PUT A DAB OF LOTION ON THAT LOOKS LIKE ITS CRACKING
YOU WILL BE DEFEATED BY THE EMPIRE
FINALLY NOT ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE FENCE SITTERS THAT EITHER SIDE QUITE LITERALLY

ANYWAY
REBEL PROPAGANDA
WE GOT A FUKIEN JIHADIST OVER HERE
HE ALLOWED THE FALCON TO ESCAPE THE FIRST DEATH STAR BECAUSE HE HAD A HOMING BEACON PLACED ABOARD AND THEN INTENTIONALLY ALLOWED IT TO ESCAPE WITH THE PLANS TO TRACK IT TO THE REBEL'S SECRET BASE WHICH IS HOW THE EMPIRE DISCOVERED IT'S LOCATION

REMEMBER LARKIN ASKS VADER IF THE HOMING BEACON WAS SECURE ABOARD THEIR SHIP AND THAT IT WAS AN AWFUL RISK
WAIT ARE YOU REFERRING TO A NEW HOPE OR RETURN OF THE JEDI
THIS SCENE DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OF ILLUSTRATING VADER AND RELATIONSHIP LARKIN IT SEEMS UNDERSTANDS THE FORCE BUT BELIEVES VADER TO BE THE ONLY REMAINING LINK BUT HE TRUSTS VADER WHEN HE SAYS I NEED TO TAKE OF THIS ALONE LIKE OK I THOUGHT THAT WAS ALL OVER BUT IF YOU THINK THIS IS LEGIT ONLY YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF IT ANYWAYS GET IT DONE

ALSO AN INTERESTING LOOK INTO BW AND RELATIONSHIP HE IS HERE THE ONLY ONE I AM WORRIED ABOUT BOTH VADER AND LARKIN UNDERSTAND THE THREAT OF BW ESPECIALLY SINCE PLAN ISN'T TO ESCAPE REALLY A GREAT DYNAMIC AND AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF SHOW DON'T TELL
I DO ALSO LOVE THE BEGINNING OF VADER AND FIGHT VADER STANDING MOTIONLESS LIGHTSABER ALREADY ACTIVATED OBVIOUSLY BOTH OF THEM KNOW THAT FIGHT ONLY ENDS ONE WAY BUT I LOVE THAT VADER IS JUST SO RUTHLESS ABOUT IT
A TREMOR IN THE FORCE


THE JEDI ARE EXTINCT THEIR FIRE HAS GONE OUT OF THE UNIVERSE


SUCH GOOD WRITING INTERESTING METAPHORS AND SYMBOLS THAT I FEEL LIKE THE PREQUEL DID NOT HAVE
THE LARKIN NOVEL WHICH IS A GREAT READ IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE MAN GOES INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HE AND VADER

WITHOUT SPOILING TOO MUCH LARKIN REMEMBERS HAVING WORKED WITH THE JEDI AND ANAKIN AND DURING THE CLONE WARS SO WHEN ONLY A HANDFUL OF KNOWN JEDI WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE ORDER ANAKIN BEING ONE OF THEM LARKIN PUTS TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T SAY IT OUTRIGHT IS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT ANAKIN BECAME DARTH VADER PARTICULARLY DUE TO CLOSENESS WITH THE EMPEROR WHICH HAS ONLY OTHERWISE BEEN SHARED LARKIN HIMSELF

DARTH VADER AND LARKIN GO ON TO WORK TOGETHER ON A COUPLE MISSIONS THAT ENABLE THEM TO FIND A MUTUAL RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER I WOULDN'T GO AS FAR AS CALLING THEM FRIENDS BUT THEY OPEN UP TO EACH OTHER ABOUT SOME OF THEIR PAST EVEN VADER TO A MUCH SMALLER DEGREE AND KNOW WHEN TO CALL EACH OTHER OUT ON THEIR SHIT THEY BOTH HAVE A SEAT AT THE EMPEROR'S TABLE BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS VADER AS THE HENCHMAN AND LARKIN AS THE MILITARY STRATEGIST THEY BOTH KNOW TO STAY OUT OF EACH OTHERS BUSINESS

FOR THAT REASON AS INDICATED IN THE SCENE OP LINKED LARKIN KNOWS TO LET VADER HANDLE WHILE IN THE OTHER FAMOUS VADER LARKIN SCENE WHERE VADER STARTS TO CHOKE ADMIRAL BOTTI LARKIN TELLS HIM TO KNOCK IT OFF AND VADER DOES SO BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT'S NOT HIS BATTLE TO FIGHT

IT'S JUST AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC BETWEEN THESE TWO AND I WISH WE COULD HAVE SEEN MORE OF IT PERHAPS IN ROGUE ONE
WHENEVER I WATCH THESE SCENES I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL AWKWARD ON BEHALF OF THE CLASSICALLY TRAINED BRITISH ACTORS KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW IT'S EASY TO ACCEPT THE DIALOGUE BECAUSE WE KNOW IT CONTRIBUTES TO A CULTURAL PHENOMENON BUT THESE ACTORS MUST HAVE FELT SILLY TALKING ABOUT JEDI AND THE FORCE AND DARTH VADER I KNOW GUINNESS FELT THAT WAY I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF SURPRISED STAR WARS WAS ABLE TO CAST SO MANY WELL REGARDED ACTORS CONSIDERING THE SCRIPT MUST HAVE LOOKED LIKE JUST ANOTHER CAMPY S LOW BUDGET SCI-FI FLICK HOLLYWOOD WAS PUMPING THOSE OUT BY THE DOZENS BACK THEN
UPLOADING A VIDEO CAPTURED FROM A MOVIE THAT WAS SHOT ON FILM AT FPS
I ALWAYS LOVE HOW NO ONE MESSES IN A JEDI SITH DUEL EVERYBODY BACKS OFF AND KNOWS THEIR ROLL
AT WHAT POINT WASN'T IT INTENTION TO ESCAPE IF VADER CAN SENSE THEN MUST HAVE SENSED VADER AS WELL WAS IT ALWAYS HIS PLAN TO CONFRONT VADER BECAUSE THE FILM MAKES IT APPEAR AS IF HE IS TRYING TO ESCAPE AND ONLY SACRIFICES HIMSELF WHEN IT IS CLEAR THAT HE HAS NO LEGITIMATE ESCAPE
I ALWAYS WATCH THE SERIES IN CHRONOLOGICAL UNIVERSE ORDER AND WHEN LARKIN SAYS IF YOU'RE RIGHT HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO ESCAPE I GET MAD ORDER VIBES FROM IT COMING RIGHT FROM EPISODE III WHERE THE JEDI ARE SYSTEMATICALLY WIPED OUT
WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME AND SORRY IF THIS HAS BEEN SAID BUT LARKIN MUST BE ONE OF THE VERY FEW THAT KNOW THAT VADER IS ANAKIN SKYWALKER WHETHER LUCAS INTENDED LARKIN TO HAVE KNOWN ANAKIN AND LIKE WE SAW IN CLONE WARS I DON'T KNOW BUT LARKIN AT LEAST KNOWS OF KENOBI AND VERY MUCH SO IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING TO THINK THAT VADER MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY FOUND SOMEONE TO CONFIDE IN IN LARKIN
I'VE JUST REALISED THAT THIS SCENE MEANS THAT LARKIN KNOWS FOR A FACT THAT VADER IS ANAKIN BY THIS SCENE HE REFERS TO AS MY OLD MASTER WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE FROM ANAKIN
THIS GIVES CREDENCE TO MY THEORY THAT DIDN'T SPEND THE ENTIRE YEARS ON TATTOOING A TREMOR IN THE FORCE THE LAST TIME I FELT IT WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF MY OLD MASTER HE CAN'T HAVE BEEN FEELING TREMORS IN THE FORCE WHEN THEY WERE BEST BUDS RIGHT
OBI WAN IS HERE AND THE FORCE IS WITH HIM

EVEN AS A KID I DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS LINE IT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THE FORCE IS SOMETHING TANGIBLE LIKE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE BROUGHT ALONG OR FORGOTTEN LIKE CAR KEYS
THAT BOING AT THE END
AAAAAND YA CROPPED IT
MAN THEY WENT A LONG WAY WITH THE DEATH STAR TO GET TO JEDDA SUPER FAR GOOD SPOT FOR A TEST FIRE
HERE'S A BIGGER VERSION IT'S INTERESTING THAT THEY CITE ROGUE ONE THE ULTIMATE VISUAL GUIDE SINCE IT ISN'T OUT YET
I TOOK THIS LARGER IMAGE THAT POSTED AND USING INSCAPE I OVERLAYED IT OVER THIS KOROR GALAXY MAP HETP

WITH THE OPACITY TOOL SET AT I USED BABOO AND TATTOOING AS MY POINTS OF REFERENCE AND RESCALED THE ROGUE ONE NEW LOCATIONS MAP AND THIS IS WHAT I GOT




THIS PLACES ZAKKEU ON GRID I ON THE OLD GALAXY MAP AND JEDDA ON GRID H THOUGHT YOU GUYS MIGHT FIND THIS INTERESTING


EDIT TURNS OUT THAT KOROR GALAXY MAP I LINKED TO ISN'T FROM KOROR THE MAP WAS MADE BY A GENTLEMAN THAT GOES BY THE NAME WEST ROYAL VAN HAGE WHO HIMSELF ADAPTED THE MAP FROM A SEVERAL OTHERS I'VE NEVER SEEN HIS MAP BEFORE SO SORRY FOR THE MISTAKE IF ANYONE IS CURIOUS ABOUT IT THEN YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT HERE

IT'S A GORGEOUS MAP THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD IN EITHER PDF OR APG THE PDF FORM HAS THE BEST QUALITY AND ALLOWS SEARCH BY PRESSING SUPER USEFUL FOR WHEN YOU WANT TO QUICKLY LOOK UP THE LOCATION OF A PLANET SYSTEM WITHOUT HAVING TO USE GRID COORDINATES THE MAP IS NOT UPDATED WITH THE NEW PLANETS YET BUT IT STILL COMES IN HANDY

ALSO I UPDATED MY OVERLAID IMAGE WITH A CLEAN VERSION OF WEST ROYAL VAN MAP

ANYWAY HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY
I OVERLAYED THE PREVIOUS CANON MAP WITH THE EW ONE AND THE SCALE IS WAY OFFICIAL AT A GLANCE IT LOOKS LIKE THE EW MAP IS REALLY AND ROTATED AWAY FROM THE VIEWER SO THIS IS KIND OF TO BE EXPECTED I DON'T THINK MUCH CAN BE GLEANED FROM IT UNFORTUNATELY
THE ONLY THING I LEARNED HERE IS SARIF IS FROM THE TATTOOING NEIGHBORHOOD
THE NEW MAP LOOKS SO EMPTY
SO STARKVILLE BASE WAS ABLE TO TARGET FROM QUITE LITERALLY ACROSS THE GALAXY AND THE ATTACK COULD GET THERE ALMOST INSTANTLY IN FFA
WHAT IS THIS FROM
I HADN'T NOTICED HOW CLOSE TATTOOING IS TO GEOGNOSIS BEFORE
BLOG UPLOADS
UM THE DEATH STAR GOES RIGHT BY NEIMOIDIA ON THE WAY TO ALDERMAN

THAT'S INTERESTING
WAIT LEGO IS A PLANET
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SO I CAN UPDATE
GALACTIC MAPS NEVER MAKE A LICK OF SENSE ALSO IS THERE A PLANET CALLED LEGO ON THIS MAP OR I AM JUST SEEING THINGS
SO THEY MOVED KESSEL I GUESS NO CHANCE OF A GOOD MAW SCENE IF THE HAN SOLO MOVIE PORTRAYS THE KESSEL RUN
OK IT'S TIME TO COMPAR THE NEW MAP WITH THE LEGENDS ATLAS
STARWARD IMAGES REVISION LATEST CB

COMPARISON IMAGE

GOT THE FORCE AWAKENS PLANET FROM THIS BLOG

OK EVERYTHING LINES UP WITH SOME THINGS TO NOTE

KESSEL IS NOW IN HUTT SPACE NOT OUTSIDE OF HUTT SPACE
AMINO APPEARS ON THE MAP RATHER THAN OUTSIDE THE GALAXY
PLANETS WHICH ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER TATTOOING GEOGNOSIS BESPIN HOTH APPEAR A LITTLE FURTHER AWAY
JEDDA APPEARS ROUGHLY IN RAKATA LOCATION BUT IT'S ALSO LABELLED AS THE MID RIM
THE HYPERSPACE LINE BETWEEN CERELLIA AND LOCATION IN THE DEEP CORE IS SHOWN AS A THICK LINE

GOT A HIGH RES OF THIS
BABOO ITS LAKE IS A PLACE WHERE ONE MIGHT WISH TO BE HELD AGAIN LOOOOL
HUH

I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT AMINO IS OUTSIDE THIS GALAXY
KALO IS GOING TO HAVE EVERY DETAIL OF THAT MOMENT ETCHED INTO HIS MEMORY THE LOOK ON HIS DAD'S FACE THE TOUCH TO HIS CHEEK IT'S GOING TO ABSOLUTELY HAUNT HIM
WHAT GAVE ME CHILLS WAS HOW QUITE THE SCENE WAS NO MUSIC NOTHING NOT EVEN SAD SOMBER MUSIC AND THEN CHEWIE LOOKING OVER THE BALCONY THE WIND BLOWING IN HIS FACE RUFFLING HIS FUR YOU KNEW HAN WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT OUT OF THIS ONE THEN IT HAPPENS CHEWIE CRIED REY CRIED I CRIED DAISY RILEY DID A PHENOMENAL JOB WITH HER EMOTION I BELIEVED IT I FELT HER PAIN IT WAS DEVASTATING
WONDERFUL SCENE INDEED THE JUNIOR NOVELIZATION BY MICHAEL POGGE TAKES THAT MOMENT AND ADDS TO IT


DON'T FORGET THE INCREDIBLE CINEMATOGRAPHY BEFORE KALO HANDS OVER THE LIGHTSABER HALF OF HIS FACE IS LIT BY THE DYING SUN AND THE OTHER HALF IS DARK SHOWING HIS INTERNAL CONFLICT HOWEVER AFTER THE SUN GOES OUT THE LIGHT DISAPPEARS FROM HIS FACE AND HE PROCEEDS TO KILL HAN
WAIT HAN DIES
IMAGINE IF HAN SHOOT FIRST THAT MOMENT TOO
IT WAS WELL DONE FOR SURE

I JUST WISH THERE WAS MORE OF A MOURNING FOR SUCH A CRUCIAL CHARACTER FOR THE SERIES
I THINK IN ONE OF THE BTS STUFF JJ OR ADAM EVEN SAID THE TOUCH WASNT IN THE SCRIPT BUT HARRISON IMPROVISED AND JUST DID IT WHEN THEY SHOT IT
IT'S BEEN A YEAR AND HANS DEATH STILL BUMS ME OUT THEY THREW AN ICON AWAY LIKE A PIECE OF TRASH
IT GUARANTEES YOU A SEAT ON OPENING NIGHT PREVENTS IT FROM GETTING SOLD OUT
MY THEATER HAD ASSIGNED SEATING SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE AT ALL THE NIGHT OF THE MOVIE
FOR ME IT WAS THE GIDDY EXCITEMENT OF HAVING THE TICKETS IN MY POCKET
I KNOW I'M GUARANTEED A SEAT OPENING NIGHT
TO RESERVE THE BEST SEATS IN THE THEATER
I WENT TO A SHOWING AT AN IMAX THAT USES FILM ONE OF LIKE IN THE COUNTRY I THINK AND IT WAS AT A MUSEUM AND WAS GOING TO SELL OUT QUICKLY ALSO I GOT TO CHOOSE MY SEATS
ASSIGNED SEATS AT ALAMO DRAFTHOUSE SERIOUSLY A PERFECT EXPERIENCE IN MY OPINION
I ALWAYS BUY CINEMA TICKETS IN ADVANCE IT'S JUST NICE TO BE ABLE TO PICK SEATS BEFORE AND HAVE EVERYTHING DONE WHEN YOU ARRIVE
MAIN REASON


SEE THE MOVIE WHEN IT RELEASES AT YOUR PREFERRED THEATER

SERIOUSLY THEY WERE SOLD OUT IN SO MANY PLACES OR ONLY A HANDFUL WERE AVAILABLE TO BUY IN PERSON

OTHER BENEFITS

SOME THEATERS OFFER ASSIGNED SEATS SO BUYING EARLY GETS YOU THE BEST SPOTS
EVENTS
UH NERD ACRED DUH
THE THEATER CLOSEST TO WHERE I LIVE WAS SOLD OUT FOR THE ENTIRE OPENING NIGHT IN SOMETHING LIKE MINUTES IF YOU DIDN'T PREORDER YOU BASICALLY JUST WEREN'T GOING TO SEE IT THE OPENING WEEKEND
THIS IS NOT THE ROAD YOUR LOOKING FOR

MOVE ALONG
NOW THIS IS PRORACING
TRY TAILGATING AGAIN I DARE YOU
I SEE LIGHTSABERS WHERE IS THE FORCE
SOME PEOPLE SHOOTING A FILM ON MY CAMPUS WERE ACTUALLY USING ONE OF THOSE CHEAP LIGHTSABER TOYS TO DIRECT TRAFFIC AT NIGHT IT ACTUALLY SEEMED TO WORK SURPRISINGLY WELL
I AM A JEDIIII
I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE ORDER CHIP SOMEHOW THE COMMANDS IMPLANTED IN THEIR CHIPS CONTAMINATED THEIR SUBCONSCIOUS AND GAVE THEM NIGHTMARES OF BETRAYING THEIR JEDI COMRADES YOU CAN SEE HOW UNCOMFORTABLE THE CLONES STANDING AROUND TUP WHEN HE PASSES THEY ALL MUST HAVE NIGHT TERRORS INFLUENCED BY THE CHIP
I ALWAYS SAW IT AS SORT OF THEIR MISSION TO KEEP ON FIGHTING SINCE THEIR WHOLE LIVES WERE CENTERED AROUND WAR THERE AREN'T MANY CLONES WHO GOT A SLOW DEATH FIVES AND TUP BOTH HAD TIME TO CONTEMPLATE THEIR END THEY WERE SET FREE IN A WAY

PROBABLY ORDER RELATED
GREAT NOW DO DUEL OF THE FATES
BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE A BLUE BLADE
WHAT ABOUT THE WEDDING BAND BROKE THE JEDI CODE HE DID
WHAT IRKS ME MORE IS THAT THEY KEEP CALLING IT OR LIGHTSABER

IT'S DAMN IT I'LL LET REY SLIP SINCE SHE DOESN'T HAVE HER OWN YET BUT COME ON
TOOK ME A WHILE TO NOTICE I WAS TOO DISTRACTED BY THOSE VR HEADSETS AT THE BOTTOM

I GUESS YOU'RE PRETTY FAR GONE WHEN YOU SEE A GREEN LIGHTSABER BLADE ON A GRAFLEX HANDLE AND IT MAKES YOU SEE RED BUT THAT'S WHERE I AM TERRIBLE ADAPTATION OF
I MIGHT BUY IT IF IT WERE REALLY THE PROPER LIGHTSABER
I ALSO HATE THE NEW DURACELL ADD WITH THE CHILDREN AT THE HOSPITAL NOT THAT I THINK CHARITY FOR CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS IS BAD OR ANYTHING

THEY USE MUSIC FROM FFA MOSTLY THEME FOR A TIE-IN WITH A MOVIE SET BEFORE THE OT LIKE DO WE NOT HAVE ANY OTHER MUSIC LAYING AROUND TO USE
THAT'S WHAT THEY NORMALLY SELL FOR ANY WAYS US
DAMN I PAID FOR THAT LIGHTSABER A COUPLE YEARS AGO
IS THAT EVEN A DEAL DON'T THEY USUALLY RETAIL FOR THAT
LOL I READ THE HEADLINE OF THE ARTICLE BELOW AND THOUGHT THAT IRKED ME
SPOILER THE NEW ICONIC LIGHTSABER GETS A NEW CRYSTAL IN EPISODE JUST BUZ
YEAH THAT'S ANNOYING BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'D DO IT OBVIOUSLY RED BLADE ON A RED BACKGROUND WOULDN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL AND A BLUE BLADE WOULD KIND OF GO AGAINST THE HOLIDAY COLOR SCHEME SO THEY DID GREEN FOR A NICE RED GREEN HOLIDAY THEME

HOWEVER THEY DEFINITELY JUST USED A DIFFERENT HILT LIKE TO DO THIS ALSO IT ANNOYS ME WHEN THEY PHOTOSHOP IN THE LIGHTSABER BLADES IT SHOULD BE A PHOTO OF WHAT THE BLADE LOOKS LIKE IN PERSON
THE UNKNOWN ROGUE PLANET IS CALLED
IF WE REALLY WANT TO GET PEDANTIC ENDOR BAVIN IV AND JEDDA ARE ALL MOONS AND POLIS MASSA IS AN ASTEROID
ALDERAMIN WASN'T REALLY IN ANH I MEAN WE NEVER SEE IT
THE CLONE WARS FILM
CHRISTOPHSIS
TETH
CORUSCANT
TATTOOING

THE HOLIDAY SPECIAL
KASHYYYK
PANNA PRIME
TATTOOING
BAVIN
EMPIRE IS THE ONLY ONE WITHOUT SAND GOOD I HATE SAND
DO MENTIONS COUNT BECAUSE IF THEY DO YOU'RE MISSING QUITE A FEW IN THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY
I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO SEE WHERE WE GO IN EPISODE VIII AND ESB IS STILL THE ONLY ONE NOT TO INCLUDE A DESERT PLANET ALTHOUGH TATTOOING HAS ONLY A CAMEO IN ROTS
JEDI GETS MORE PLANETS IN THE SPECIAL EDITION BABOO CORUSCANT
I THINK THE DEATH STAR COUNTS AS A PLANET
WHAT IS THIS PLANET CALLED DADU THAT YOU SAID WILL BE IN ROGUE
TECHNICALLY POLIS MASSA IS ON AN ASTEROID
SPEAKING TOTALLY OUT OF MY ASS AS I DON'T READ THE BOOKS

I WOULD ASSUME IT'S NOT THAT TECHNOLOGY DECLINES SO MUCH AS THE EMPIRE HAS A STRANGLEHOLD ON ANYTHING HIGH MILITARY QUALITY
SOMEONE HAD A SIMILAR QUESTION A LITTLE WHILE BACK AND I WROTE A FAIRLY LENGTHY RESPONSE TO IT I THINK IT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION PRETTY WELL
R STARWARD COMMENTS
IT DIDN'T DECLINE THE EMPIRE'S CONTROL MADE EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING IMPOVERISHED

THE EMPIRE THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS
IT WAS BEST DESCRIBED TO ME BY THINKING OF CLASSIC CARS

CLASSIC CARS LOOK SLEEK COLORFUL ARTFUL MODERN CARS ARE MORE UTILITARIAN AND BASIC IN COMPARISON THE SHIPS OF THE PT ARE LIKE CLASSIC CARS IN THE OT TECHNOLOGY HASN'T DECLINED BUT DESIGNS HAVE CHANGED
GIVEN THAT THEY BUILT TWO STATIONS CAPABLE OF DESTROYING PLANETS AND DEVELOPED THE TECHNOLOGY FOR STARKVILLE BASE A MASSIVE LEAP FORWARD IN THE OTHERWISE STAGNANT HYPERSPACE TECHNOLOGY I'D SAY NUMBER
I ALSO THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE PLANETS IN THE PREQUEL WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THE MAJOR CITIES THE OT TAKES PLACE IN LESS LUXURIOUS PLACES
HE BROUGHT BALANCE TO THE FORCE THE SITH WERE DEFEATED OR SO YEARS OF PEACE HAPPENED THERE'S NOTHING SAYING THE PEACE CAN'T BE DISRUPTED AGAIN
THE JOB OF THE CHOSEN ONE WAS TO DESTROY THE SITH THEIR INCREASING POWER IN THE GALAXY WAS MASSIVELY THROWING THE FORCE OUT OF BALANCE AND DARTH SIMIOUS WAS UNLOCKING THE POWER TO RESHAPE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE ANAKIN SAFEGUARDED THE FORCE FOR ALL TIME FROM THE DANGER OF THE SITH

HE FULFILLED THE PROPHECY

INTERESTINGLY THE PROPHECY EXISTED IN BOTH JEDI AND SITH LORE

THE SITH HAD THE PROPHECY OF THE A BEING THAT WOULD BE SO POWERFUL IN THE DARK SIDE AND THE WAYS OF THE SITH THERE WOULD NEVER BE A SITH LIKE THEM AGAIN SOME BELIEVE IT TO BE DARTH BANE DARTH PLAGUERS BELIEVED HE WOULD HELP DISCOVER OR CREATE HIM DARTH SIMIOUS WAS THE MOST POWERFUL SITH EVER BUT DARTH VADER KILLED THE SITH THERE WOULD NEVER BE ANOTHER HE TECHNICALLY FULFILLED THAT PROPHECY TOO
BALANCE TO THE FORCE REFERS TO THE SITH INFLUENCE ON IT NOT THE DARK SIDE IN GENERAL NOR DOES THE BALANCE OF THE FORCE HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MURDEROUS REGIMES LIKE THE FIRST ORDER

IMPORTANCE IS GREAT HE HAS OFFICIALLY ENDED THE SITH THERE ARE NO MORE APPRENTICES OR MASTERS HIDDEN WHO FOLLOW SITH LORE LEGEND AND BELIEFS THE LAST SITH DIED WHEN THE FAMED JEDI ANAKIN TURNED ON HIS MASTER AND THREW DARTH SIMIOUS TO HIS DEATH MISSION AS THE CHOSEN ONE WAS NOT TO SAVE OR RESTORE THE REPUBLIC AND IT WAS NOT TO END ALL EVIL FOREVER AND CREATE AN UTOPIA LIFE THROUGHOUT THE GALAXY WITH NO WARS EVER AGAIN HE WAS SIMPLY THE ONE WHO WOULD BRING THE SITH DOWN
SNOKE ISNT A SITH
THE IDEA WAS DESTROYING THE SITH WHICH IS WHAT HE DID IT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT NON AFFILIATED SITH DARK SIDERS
ACCORDING TO THE PREQUEL HE WAS JUST MEANT TO BRING BALANCE TO THE FORCE THE JEDI ASSUMED IT WAS DESTROYING THE SITH

HE ENDS UP DOING BOTH

HE KILLS ALL OF THE JEDI EXCEPT AND YODA 2 OF THEM AND JOINS SIMIOUS BECOMING A SITH LORD 2 OF THEM THOUGH I JUST ALWAYS CONSIDERED IT TO MEAN NO SITH

SO AT LEAST THERE WAS LITERAL BALANCE IF YOU CONSIDER THE WHOLE 2 V 2 THING HE THEN DESTROYS THE SITH BY KILLING SIMIOUS LATER WHICH IF YOU CONSIDER BALANCE BEING JUST NO SITH ETC THEN THAT'S TRUE TOO

THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD BRING PEACE FOREVER OR SOMETHING IS KIND OF STUPID AND UNREALISTIC I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY INTENDED BUT IF IT IS THEN I JUST CHOOSE NOT TO SEE IT THAT WAY LOL

SNOKE ISN'T A SITH SO ANAKIN DID FULFILL HIS PURPOSE OF DESTROYING THE SITH THERE WILL ALWAYS BE OTHER FORCE USERS LIGHT AND DARK BUT THE SITH ARE DONE


GIVEN THAT THE CHOSEN ONE PROPHESY ISN'T PRESENT IN THE ORIGINALS AND ISN'T EVER EXPLAINED IN THE PREQUEL I'D SAY IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT

YODA EVEN HAS A LINE ABOUT HOW THE ORIGINAL PROPHESY COULD BE MISUNDERSTOOD SO I'D SAY IT'S JUST A BACKGROUND DETAIL TO THE UNIVERSE

PROBABLY DON'T EXPECT TO EVER SEE IT AGAIN IN NEW CANON TOO
BLAME THAT ON JJ HE'S THE ONE WHO RUINED THE ENDING OF ROTC
IMHO THE MONIKER CHOSEN ONE IS STUPID BRINGING BALANCE TO THE FORCE MEANS EQUAL LIGHT AND DARK BOTH ACTING AT THE SAME TIME ANAKIN NEVER FIT THAT ROLE AT ALL WHAT IS OVER LOOKED HERE IS THAT LIGHT AND DARK ARE NOT THE SAME AS GOOD AND EVIL NECESSARILY FOR INSTANCE A FORCE CHOKE IS ALWAYS CONSIDERED A SITH ABILITY BUT LUKE FORCE CHOKES THE SHIT OUT OF ABBAS GUARDS IN ROTC IF ANYTHING ANAKIN BEING THE CHOSEN ONE MEANT THAT HE WOULD BRING LUKE AND LEIA INTO THE WORLD AND THEY WOULD BRING BALANCE TO THE FORCE THE DICHOTOMY HERE WOULD BE EITHER LUKE IS LIGHT OR DARK AND LEIA WOULD BE THE OPPOSITE OF WHATEVER HE WAS OR VICE VERSA
THAT'S RUDE
THAT'S NICE
I RECOMMEND MAALOX
VOMITING IS GOOD FOR YOUR CORE THOUGH
ANY EPISODE VIII NEWS TAKES AWAY FROM ROGUE ONE A TITLE A POSTER A TRAILER PHOTO ANYTHING EP VIII WILL TAKE THE CONVERSATION AWAY FROM ROGUE ONE AND THAT'S JUST BAD MARKETING
THEY DON'T WANT TO OVER SHADOW ROGUE ONE
THE SHADOW FALLS

U ROBOTICAL
THE FORCE HITS SNOOZE
THE MOVIE WILL BE NAMED AFTER WHAT LUKE SAID AT THE END OF EPISODE VII

THE MOVIE WILL BE CALLED STAR WARS EPISODE VIII
THEY ARE HOLDING OFF FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE

THERE YOU GO

RIGHT NOW THEY WANT ALL THE ATTENTION ON ROGUE ONE WITH EPVII SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST MOVIE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE BEFORE IT SO THE REVEALS CAME SOONER AND THEY KINDA WANT THE FOCUS ON TO MAKE MONEY BEFORE TURNING IT OVER TO EPVIII

CHANCES ARE IF WE DON'T GET A TITLE REVEAL BETWEEN JAN AND MARCH OF NEXT YEAR SOMETHING WILL BE REVEALED AND SHOWN STAR WARS CELEBRATION WHICH IS IN APRIL
WHAT COULD THE TITLE SPOIL

IT'S SMART MARKETING TO KEEP IT SECRET UNTIL AFTER ROGUE ONE FOR SOME REASON PEOPLE REALLY CARE ABOUT THE TITLE AND ARE DYING TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THE LONGER THEY BUILD ANTICIPATION THE BIGGER THE HYPE MACHINE GETS AND THE MORE IT'S TALKED ABOUT WHEN IT'S FINALLY REVEALED THEY'LL DO THE SAME FOR THE TEASER AND THEN THE TRAILER S AND AS THE MOVIE APPROACHES THEY'LL RELEASE TIE IN MATERIALS AND SET PHOTOS TO FURTHER THE HYPE ENSURING THAT AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE ARE EXCITED
EP VIII STANDING ON A CLIFF IT'LL BE AFTER THE NEW YEAR
FIRST ORDER STRIKES BACK
SUPPOSEDLY EPISODE WILL BE CALLED FALL OF THE RESISTANCE
MAY I ASK WHY
MY FAVOURITE HETP
THE SHOT WITH THE LAVA ERUPTION WHEN THEY'RE ON THE BRIDGE IS BETTER
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF THIS ONE THERE'S NOTHING FANCY ABOUT IT BUT THE DARK ROBES AND THE WAY PALATINE PUTS HIS HAND ON SHOULDER FEELS SO EMPEROR VADER
I LOVE A GOOD HALLWAY SHOT AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY
MAN I GOTTA SAY IT THE ONE THING THE PREQUEL DID WELL WAS THE PULLED BACK SHOTS AWESOME LANDSCAPES OF PLANETS IT'S A COOL SHOT BUT HOW COULD ONE OF A HALLWAY BE YOUR FAVORITE OF THE PREQUEL
THAT SHOT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER IF ANAKIN HAD A RED LIGHTSABER STILL DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T HAVE PALATINE GIVE ANAKIN ONE OF HIS LIGHTSABERS TO USE OR HAVE ANAKIN HASTILY MAKE A NEW ONE
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED THIS ONE
YEAH IT'S PRETTY DOPE
IT'S A GOOD ONE BUT THERE'S TOO MANY OTHER STELLAR SHOTS FOR THIS TO REALLY BE CLOSE THE TOP FOR ME
HONESTLY I FELT LIKE THIS FIGHT WAS SHOT BLANDLY I LIKE THE PREQUEL BUT THIS FIGHT WAS NOT DONE AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHERS IN THE SERIES
THIS DUEL COULD HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE IF IT HAD JUST BEEN ABOUT THE EMOTION
FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY ONE OF THE CLINGIEST WHEN ANAKIN AND ARE LITERALLY JUST TWIRLING THEIR LIGHTSABERS FOR A STUPIDLY LONG TIME BEFORE TRYING TO ATTACK AGAIN

EDIT WORDS AND AN ELEGANT WEAPON FROM A MORE CIVILIZED AGE NOT HARD CANDIES
OVERLY CHOREOGRAPHED AND THE CHARACTERS FIGHTING EACH OTHER ARE SHALLOW AND HOLLOW AND HARD TO CARE ABOUT CINEMATOGRAPHY DOESN'T MATTER IF YOUR STORY IS BAD
IT'S SO DENSE
MY FAVORITE SCENE IS THE END CREDITS DURING EPISODE
THIS WAS FUCKING AMAZING SERIOUSLY WHEN IS SPACEBALLS 2 GONNA BE MADE
I'M GONNA GET FIRED FOR LAUGHING SO HARD THANK YOU
LORD VADER THE FLEET HAS MOVED OUT OF LIGHTSPEED AND WE'RE PREPARING TO
NO NO NO LIGHT SPEED IS TOO SLOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO RIGHT TO LUDICROUS SPEED

LORD VADER WE ARE HONORED BY YOUR PRESENCE
HOW MANY ASSHOLES WE GOT ON THIS SHIP ANYHOW

CLASSIC
THIS VIDEO NEEDS MORE ATTENTION
I FOR ONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE OTHER
I LIKED THE CLONE TROOPERS HAD COLOUR ON THEIR ARMOUR GAVE THEM PERSONALITY
I LIKE IT
LOOKS GREAT
I'VE NEVER NOTICED THIS BUT THIS IS HONESTLY HILARIOUS
HANDMAIDENS ARE ALWAYS AT THE QUEEN'S SIDE AND ANSWER DIRECTLY TO THE QUEEN SO FADME DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO CHANGE HER NAME IF SHE WAS WITH HER DECOY AND NUTE SUNRAY SHOWED UP THE DECOY WOULD BE SMART ENOUGH TO NOT ADDRESS HER HANDMAIDEN
BECAUSE THE PREQUEL WERE SHOT FROM A FIRST DRAFT
THE BABOO PROBABLY KNOW FADME THE GALAXY AT LARGE WOULD KNOW QUEEN AMYGDALA AND LIKE ANY BABOO QUEEN SHE IS EASILY RECOGNISABLE IN HER EXCESSIVE MAKE UP AND EXPENSIVE GOWNS FADME IS JUST A PLAIN IF PRETTY HANDMAIDEN
ALSO WHEN SHE'S A SENATOR WHY DOES SHE GO BY PADMÉ AMYGDALA SHOULDN'T IT BE PADMÉ NABERRIE
BECAUSE GEORGE IS A HACK WRITER AND WANTED A TWIST DESPITE IT ADDING NOTHING TO THE STORY
I THINK SHE ONLY CALLS HERSELF IS CALLED FADME IN FRONT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN BABOO POLITICS STUFF PERHAPS SHE'D USED DIFFERENT NAMES BEFORE

THE REAL ANSWER IS IT'S JUST AN INCREDIBLY MINOR PLOT HOLE
MAYBE FADME IS A COMMON ENOUGH NAME THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER
I DON'T THINK IT WAS GOOD WRITING BY ANY MEANS BUT IF TRUMP HAD AN ASSISTANT NAMED DONALD I WOULDN'T REALLY JUMP TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS TRUMP IN DISGUISE
HER REGENCY NAME WAS FAR MORE PUBLICIZED AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT FADME IS A COMMON NAME ON BABOO ALSO IT FITS IN WITH THE THEME ALL THE OTHER HANDMAIDENS HAVE CODE SABE ECT
MAYBE FADME IS JUST AS COMMON AS SMITH
MAYBE NO ONE KNEW HER REAL NAME BEING ROYALTY MAYBE EVERYONE JUST KNEW HER AS AMYGDALA
BECAUSE SHE WAS ACTING IN SECRET
SHE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN KNOWN AS FADME BEFORE SHE INTRODUCED HERSELF TO AND ANAKIN AS FADME SO MAYBE SHE JUST KEPT USING THAT TO MAKE THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE THEY'RE REALLY THE ONLY ONES WHO REFER TO HER AS THAT
IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE ASKED FOR THE NAMES OF OTHER HANDMAIDENS SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T THINK IT MATTERED OR DIDN'T THINK IT THROUGH
MY HEADCANON HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT PEOPLE SIMPLY KNOW THE QUEEN AS QUEEN AMYGDALA

HER FIRST NAME IS KNOWN ONLY TO A SELECT FEW
CHANGING HER NAME MADE IT TOO CONFUSING UNLIKE THE TRADE BLOCKADE DUCKERY I STILL DO NOT FULL UNDERSTAND TO THIS DAY
IRL REASON GEORGE ISN'T KNOWN FOR THINKING THINGS THROUGH

IN UNIVERSE WELL SKYWALKER IS THE SMITH LAST NAME IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE I'D IMAGINE FADME BEING A SARAH OR SOMETHING OF BABOO INCREDIBLY COMMON

EDIT REALLY GUYS
SUPPOSEDLY IT'S SOMETHING THEY HAD AT LUCASFILM WHEN HE WAS VISITING THERE THE LUKE PICTURE COMES FROM A STICKER THAT STEELE WARS WAS SELLING THERE COULD BE HIDDEN MEANINGS OR IT COULD JUST BE SOME INSIDE JOKE STUFF
WHAT IS TSF
CLEARLY IF LUKE FITS HE'LL SITS
GIRL NO ONE CAN SEE YOUR ROUGE WITH THAT HELMET ON
IT'S TRADEMARKED TOO

I JUST LIKE TO IMAGINE LUCASFILM TRADEMARKED BOTH ROGUE ONE AND ROUGE ONE IN ANTICIPATION OF TYPOS
EVEN THE MERCHANDISERS CAN'T SPELL ROGUE CORRECTLY
IS THIS A TREE ORNAMENT
I'D PASSIVE HER CHARACTER IS ALL ABOUT THE POLITICAL AND NOW MORE LEADERSHIP ROLES I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE BOOKS COMICS FOR THE NEW CANON BUT I'D ASSUME AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW REPUBLIC SHE WOULD HAVE DEVOTED ALL HER TIME AND EFFORT INTO HELPING TO GUIDE THE NEW GOVERNMENT

WHEN WOULD SHE HAVE FOUND TIME TO TRAIN SHE PROBABLY HAS SOME LOOSE CONNECTION TO THE FORCE AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE FILMS BUT I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY HAD HER GO DOWN EVEN A FEW STEPS DOWN THE JEDI PATHOLOGY I'M ALSO NOT SURE WHAT BENEVOLENT FORCE LIGHTNING WOULD BE LIGHTNING KILLS THAT SHIT IS DANGEROUS
I REALLY DON'T WANT HER TO DO ANYTHING RELATED TO THE FORCE JEDI BUT IT'D BE PRETTY COOL IF SHE WAS IN A TOUGH SPOT AND DID A PRETTY COOL FORCE PUSH
HER CHARACTER FITS WITH CARRIES CARRIES POSSIBLE INABILITY TO MAKE THAT BELIEVABLE SO I'M COOL WITH SOME MINOR FORCE SENSING AND NOTHING MORE SHE FOLLOWED HER EXAMPLE NOT HER DADS
NTO AT ALL SHE'S NOT A JEDI SHE'S BARELY A FORCE USER AND I RECALL PEOPLE MENTIONING THAT LUKE TRIED TO TRAIN HER AND SHE SHOWED LITTLE APTITUDE FOR IT
I DON'T THINK WE'LL SEE ANYTHING OTHER THAN HER USING THE FORCE TO REACH OUT TO LUKE OR REY SOMEHOW OR MAYBE EVEN ANAKIN OR BEN IT WOULD BE FUNNY TO SEE HER CASUALLY WAVE HER HAND AND SEND A BUNCH OF STORM TROOPERS FLYING BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN
IT WOULD LOOK UNBELIEVABLY CHEESY I BET I REALLY HOPE THEY JUST FOCUS ON HER POLITICAL MILITARY MOTIVATIONS SHE DEFINITELY IS BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE IT EVEN MORE IF SHE DOESN'T PURSUE THAT ASPECT OF HER LIFE SO THAT SHE CAN BETTER SERVE THE NEW REPUBLIC
I THINK SHE SHOULD SHOW SOMETHING MORE THAN SENSING DEAD IN ROTC LUKE SAID HE WOULD TRAIN HERALDRY EVEN IF SHE DIDN'T BECAME PROFICIENT IN FIGHTING SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE REACHING FOR A SMALL DEVICE WITH THE FORCE DURING A TENSE SITUATION COULD WORK
ON A SCALE OF TO NEGATIVE FIFTEEN
IF WE DO SEE HER USE THE FORCE I'D LIKE IT TO BE AT A MINIMUM I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT SHE RECEIVED THE MOST BASIC TRAINING FROM LUKE AND THEN HE WENT OFF ON HIS ADVENTURES WITH BEN EVEN IN LEGENDS IT TOOK HER QUITE A WHILE TO GET AROUND TO HER JEDI TRAINING SHE WAS FOCUSED ON BUILDING UP THE NEW REPUBLIC AND THIS LEIA IS OR WAS BY THE TIME OF FFA FOCUSED ON JUST THAT
LIGHTSABER NOT SO MUCH

MAYBE SOME OF THE FORCE TO SHOW SHE HAS IT BUT NOTHING OVER THE TOP
SOMETHING SMALL MAYBE SHE LOSES HER BLASTER AND FORCE PULLS IT TO HERALDRY
I GET SHE CHOSE THE POLITICAL PATH INSTEAD OF THE JEDI BUT I'D REALLY THINK IT WOULD PAY OFF TO SEE HER USE THE FORCE TO SOME EXTENT TO TIE IN WITH THE FACT SHE IS STRONG IN THE FORCE LIKE LUKE BUT UNTRAINED YODA KNEW THIS AND SHE WAS THE OTHER HOPE FOR THE JEDI

I THINK A SCENE WHERE SHE IS REFUSING TO LEAVE HER POST DURING AN ATTACK AND IS THEN SURROUNDED BY STORM-TROOPER WOULD BE A GOOD SET UP FOR AN EMOTIONAL OUTBURST OF THE FORCE UNTRAINED BUT DESPERATE LEIA SUCCESSFULLY FORCE PUSHES THEM AWAY OR BRINGS THE CEILING DOWN ON THEM MAYBE EVEN A SCENE WITH KALO REN WHERE HE DESCRIBES MURDER TO PUSH HOW HE'S TRULY MOVED TO THE DARK SIDE RECITING HOW IT HAPPENED AND HANS FACE CAUSING LEIA TO FORCE PUSH HIM FREEZE HIM

SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO SHOW HER POTENTIAL AS A SKYWALKER BY BLOOD
NONE HOPE SHE NEVER DOES IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY OUT OF CHARACTER
LEIA IS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER EXACTLY BECAUSE SHE'S NOT A JEDI AND DOESN'T DEPEND ON THE FORCE FOR ANYTHING
OH PLEASE NO
AT MOST AT THE VERY MOST I WOULD BE OK WITH LEIA BEING ABLE TO VAGUELY COMMUNICATE THROUGH THE FORCE THE WAY LUKE DID WITH HER ON BESPIN BEYOND THAT NO THANKS HER CHARACTER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A POLITICAL AND MILITARY LEADER FIRST AND FOREMOST SHE'S A REFLECTION OF HER REAL MOTHER AND HER ADOPTED FATHER NOT ANAKIN I DON'T NEED TO SEE HER BECOME A POWERFUL FORCE USER AT ALL LIKE I SAY AT BEST SEEING HER INFLUENCE SOMEONE COMMUNICATE TO SOMEONE WOULD BE TOLERABLE I WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE ANY FORCE GRABS OR PUSHES AND DEFINITELY NO LIGHTSABERS
NOT MUCH
I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE ANYTHING BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN EVEN THOUGH LEIA CHOSE NOT TO PURSUE HER TRAINING SHE STILL HAS A CLAIRVOYANCE THROUGH THE FORCE WHERE SHE CAN SENSE THAT THOSE SHE CARES ABOUT ARE IN DANGER I'M FINE IF WE SEE MORE OF THAT BUT I DON'T NEED HER WIELDING A LIGHTSABER OR FORCE PUSHING ANYONE NOT AT THIS POINT WITH HER ARC
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT SADLY SHE'S JUST THERE TO SENSE WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT NOW INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY BEING A JEDI
I'D BE COOL WITH AN UNREFINED FORCE PUSH WHILE NEAR FINN OR SOMETHING AND FINN THOUGHT HE DID IT IT COULD BE COMICS SCENE
FOR CONTINUALITIES SAKE SHE'S KINDA GOT TO EVEN IF IT'S JUST A HEAD NOD TO HER ABILITIES A JEDI MIND TRICK OR SOMETHING JUST KEEP HER AWAY FROM THE LIGHTSABERS
I DON'T WANT HER TO I USED TO REALLY LIKE THE IDEA BUT NOW I SERIOUSLY DOUBT ABILITY TO DELIVER IT LEIA IN FFA WAS ONE OF MY LEAST FAVORITE PORTRAYALS IN THE SERIES
NR MODSUPPORT

SOLD
COME OUT BEFORE THE TRILOGY IS OVER
WHAT NEW STAR WARS GAME IS THIS ABOUT
BETTER BE OPEN WORLD WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF SHIPS THAT YOU CAN BUY AND CUSTOMIZE OPTION TO BE A JEDI OR SITH OR AT LEAST AN EVIL MOTHERFUCKER THE ABILITY TO VISIT ICONIC LOCATIONS FROM EVERY MOVIE GOOD WRITING
HONESTLY AS MUCH AS I CAN'T WAIT FOR A STAR WARS STORY DRIVEN GAME THE ONE THING THAT WOULD MAKE ME PISS MY PANTS IN EXCITEMENT WOULD BE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SEQUEL TO REPUBLIC COMMANDO
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SORT OF HOPING FOR AN OVERALL WITCHER TYPE STAR WARS GAME I DON'T KNOW THAT REPAWN COULD PULL THAT OFFICIAL I HOPE SO
IMPRESSIVE MOST IMPRESSIVE
NICE ABOUT TO GO GET A MYTHOSAUR MYSELF THINKING RED BECAUSE REASONS OR A

SWEET DESIGN THOUGH
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE MY THING IF IT WAS SMALLER AND FIT JUST SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TRICE AND SHOULDER BUT ETHER WAY GREAT FREAKING WORK
LOOKS LIKE HE'S FLEXING BOBA NOT THE DUDE
R STARWARSTATTOO
THAT'S FUCKING SICK DUDE
LOVE ANGO
HE ALSO TOLD OBI WAN IN EPISODE 2 HE DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM

I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING AT THE NOTION OF A MUTILATED DOOK KNEELING BEFORE ANAKIN WITH TWO LIGHTSABERS AT HIS NECK AND SCREAMING PALPATINEISASITHLORDHESTHEONEYOUVEBEENLOOKINGFORITOLDOBIWANBUTHEDIDNTLISTENDONTKILLMEPLS
ANAKIN WOULDN'T BELIEVE HIM ANAKIN IS INCREDIBLY CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN ABILITIES AND PALATINE HAS BEEN HIS FRIEND AND MENTOR FOR YEARS
ASSUMING ANAKIN BELIEVES DOOK PALATINE KILLS EVERYONE

ANAKIN IS GOOD BUT HE'S NOT THAT GOOD HE HAS NO IDEA HOW TO DEAL WITH FORCE LIGHTNING AND YOU KNOW HIDEOUS HAS HIS LIGHTSABERS UP HIS SLEEVE SOMEWHERE
HE FUCKED UP MAUL AND SAVAGE NOT BEAT MOPPED THE FLOOR WITH WITHOUT BREAKING A SWEAT HIS FUCKING HOOD DIDN'T EVEN COME OFFICIAL

ANAKIN LOSES THAT FIGHT PALATINE BEHEADS THE UNCONSCIOUS KENOBI KILLS DOOK FOR HIS TREACHERY AND HOPS IN AN ESCAPE POD

THE CLONE WARS CONTINUE UNTIL HE DEEMS IT WORTH ENDING
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW YOU'RE THE SITH LORD
CAN YOU IMAGINE LOL PALATINE WOULD WHISPER OH SCREW YOU TYRANNUS
IF PALATINE HAD SENSED DOOK WAS ABOUT TO RAT HIM OUT HE'D PROBABLY JUST GENTLY FORCE PUSH NECK THAT LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO LIGHTSABERS MAKE IT LOOK LIKE SUICIDE OR SOMETHING
ANAKIN IS PRETTY STUPID PALATINE JUST TOLD HIM THAT THE HE NEEDED TO KILL YOUNGLINGS
THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN MADE BY PREQUEL HATERS LIKE TIMES

THERE IS NO ANSWER IT'S JUST ANOTHER WEIRD THING FROM THE PREQUEL

SOMEWHAT RELEVANT
DOES IT EVEN SAY ANYWHERE THE DOOK KNEW THAT PALATINE WAS SIMIOUS
DOES IT EVEN SAY ANYWHERE THE DOOK KNEW THAT PALATINE WAS SIMIOUS
DOES IT EVEN SAY ANYWHERE THE DOOK KNEW THAT PALATINE WAS SIMIOUS
I'M GETTING TIRED OF HOW REBELS ONLY GOOD EPISODES ARE THE PREMIER AND THE FINALE EPISODES AND THE REST IS JUST FILLER GARBAGE THE MOST MEANINGFUL EPISODES BESIDES THOSE WOULD BE THE MID SEASON ONES AND ONE OR TWO GOOD ONES IN BETWEEN A LOT OF YOU WILL DISAGREE WITH ME ON THAT BUT REBELS NEEDS BETTER DIRECTION FOUR EPISODE ARCS LIKE THE CLONE WARS SHOW COULD REALLY HELP BECAUSE I'M REALLY LOOSING INTEREST ESPECIALLY WITH THRAWN DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
HONDO ALWAYS CRACKS ME UP IN BOTH SERIES

IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS PERIOD OF CANON IS EXPLICITLY BEING WRITTEN TO THE MENTALITY OF I MEAN GREAT IF YOU'RE AN EIGHT YEAR OLD OTHERWISE WITH HANDFUL OF EXCEPTIONS THE EPISODES ARE PRETTY SHALLOW
THIS MAY BE AN UNPOPULAR OPINION BUT I CANNOT STAND HONDO EPISODES
IT ERGS ME TO NO END THAT HONDO SOMEHOW MANAGED TO BECOME A FAN FAVORITE HE'S COMIC RELIEF IN A SHOW THAT DOESN'T NEED IT AND IT'S JUST BAD IT'S GIVES ME ANXIETY MORE THAN IT MAKES ME LAUGH NOW THEY'RE NAMING ENTIRE EPISODES AFTER HIM I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF SOME YOU AND JUST NOT WATCH THIS EPISODE QUEUE THE DOWN VOTING
SORRY FOR THE LOW QUALITY PIC MY PHONE IS ANCIENT

ALSO HERE'S THE SUBSCRIBERS COVER HETP
GOOD SPOT THOUGH SHE'S MIRIALAN RATHER THAN MIRALUKA
I REALLY LIKE THE OLD LEGENDS AUTHORS NEW BOOKS BUT CLAUDIA GRAY HAS BEEN FANTASTIC SO FAR AS WELL
I FORGET WHERE BUT I THINK LUCENT ALSO REFERENCES THE REPUBLIC COMMANDO SERIES SPECIFICALLY THEIR OPERATIONS AGAINST A SEPARATIST CELL I FORGET WHEN IT WAS MENTIONED BUT IT WAS MENTIONED THAT A GROUP DID THAT
NO IT WAS A REFERENCE TO TORPEDO SPHERES
WHAT THE FUCK
FAN SERVICE A STAR WARS STORY COMING TO THEATERS NEVER
PLEASE DON'T WRITE STAR WARS MOVIES
A GOOD START BUT IT'S MISSING A THREE-WAY FACE OFF BETWEEN A GRIZZLED CATTO YOUNG MAZ JANATA AND CYBORG MACE HINDU
I CAN'T BELIEVE I READ ALL OF THAT
YOU POSTED THIS SAME THING ABOUT A MONTH AGO GIVE IT A REST ALREADY
YOU HAD ME A MANDALORIAN MASK
WHAT
CUT OUT ASOKA AND REX AND MAUL AS THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE IN THE PREMISE OF THIS MOVIE AND I DON'T MIND THE IDEA WON'T HAPPEN BUT I LIKE THE CONNECTION TO BEVAN AND MALACHOR
WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING BECAUSE I NEED SOME OF IT
I PROBABLY SHOULD STOP WATCHING THESE SPOTS AS THEY COME OUT I'M JUST TOO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE
THIS IS A REBELLION ISN'T IT SOUNDED DIFFERENT THIS TIME AROUND
IT'S SO CLOSE
CASSIAN IS SHAPING UP TO BE MY FAVORITE OF ALL THE CHARACTERS

I COULDN'T FACE MYSELF IF I GIVE UP NOW
I GET THE FEELING TUMBLR IS GONNA HAVE A FIELD DAY SHIPPING AYN AND CASSIAN THEY DO SEEM TO HAVE REALLY GOOD CHEMISTRY
MORE NEW DIALOGUE IN THIS TV SPOT I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH WE'RE GETTING
I LIKE THE TAG LINE HOPE BEGINS WITH THEM NICE LITTLE LEAD INTO NOD TO A NEW HOPE
WHO'S HOLDING HANDS AT
ROMANCE CONFIRMED S
CAN IT BE THE ALREADY
IT'S GONNA SUCK WHEN THEY ALL DIE
HEY THEY REDID HER THIS IS A REBELLION ISN'T IT LINE IN ADC VOICE SOUNDS MUCH MORE SERIOUS AND DEEPER
READ CATALYST THE DEATH STAR WE SEE AT THE END OF REVENGE OF THE SITH IS A STRUCTURE THAT ACTUALLY IS IN THE STATE WE SEE IT IN BY IT'S JUST THE DIFFICULTIES WITH GETTING THE WEAPON SYSTEMS RIGHT THAT DELAY ITS COMPLETION BY ANOTHER NINETEEN YEARS
READ CATALYST IT EXPLAINS MORE ON WHY IT TOOK SO LONG BUT IF YOU STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE THE DEATH STAR IS THE SIZE OF A SMALL MOON AND THEY COMPLETED IT IN ABOUT YEARS JUST THINK HOW LONG IT TAKES US TO BUILD BUILDINGS OR ROADS SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE MONTHS TO GET ONE STRUCTURE UP AND IT'S NOWHERE NEAR THE SIZE OF A DEATH STAR IF YOU COMPARE IT TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES SMALLER STRUCTURE TO GET DESIGNED AND BUILT AND THEN SCALE THAT UP TO THE SIZE OF A SMALL MOON YEARS SOUNDS REASONABLE
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE IMPERIAL CLASS STAR DESTROYERS WERE ALREADY BEING PREPARED FOR THE REPUBLIC THEY JUST ONLY STARTED BEING USED AFTER ORDER KEEP IN MIND PALATINE HAD TRIED ORCHESTRATING THE END OF THE WAR A COUPLE OF TIMES BY NOW AS EVIDENCED BY THE CLONE WARS

I'M PRETTY SURE THE VADER SIMIOUS SCENE AT THE END IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PRESENT AS IT IS INTERSPERSED WITH OTHER SCENES FROM THE PRESENT AND WOULDN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO NOT BE THE PRESENT

THE DEATH STAR WASN'T UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR YEARS IT WAS COMPLETED THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DESTROY A PLANET WITH IT IT'S LIKE A CAR WITHOUT FUEL THE CAR IS BUILT YOU JUST CAN'T DRIVE IT
IT'S A BATTLE STATION THE SIZE OF A SMALL MOON WITH A SUPER LASER THAT CAN DESTROY PLANETS AND NO ONE HAS BUILT ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE SO I THINK YEARS IS VERY REASONABLE
I ALWAYS JUST ASSUMED IT WAS A POINT IN THE FUTURE THIS ISN'T A GROUNDBREAKING IDEA
VADER NEEDS A MAXIMUM OF 2 MINUTES TO LEARN HOW TO WALK AND STAND NEXT TO HIS MASTER ON A SHIP'S BRIDGE THE STATION ITSELF DIDN'T TAKE A CRAZY LONG TIME TO BUILDING IT WAS THE PLANET KILLING WEAPON SYSTEM THAT TOOK SO LONG TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT
IT'S NICE TO SEE ONE OF THESE IMAGES THAT SOMEONE ACTUALLY PUT WORK INTO AND DIDN'T JUST USE AN APP TO MAKE A SHITTY IMAGE TO POST FOR KARMA AWESOME WORK
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS STYLE OF ART I REALLY LIKE IT IT LOOKS SUPER COOL
BOBA FETT BOBA FETT WHERE

YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT THE ILLUSTRATOR HE DOES SIMILAR STUFF I THINK HE STARTED OUT WITH CUTTING SMALL BITS OF PAPER RATHER THAN USING WATERCOLOUR THOUGH AND HAS A WHOLE SERIES OF STAR WARS PORTRAITS
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH EMOTION YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE FROM A HELMETED MANUAL I CAN SEE HIS TORTURED SOUL I CAN SEE HOW HE KNOWS THAT NOT ALL OF HIS PREY ARE BAD PEOPLE

CHRIST HOW HARD IS IT TO CAPITALIZE

I HAVEN'T ENJOYED AN AMMO SINCE GALAXIES SO ANYTHING THAT'S LIKE THAT
I WOULD RATHER A HANDCRAFTED RPG AN EPIC STYLE STAND ALONE STORY AND SET ON ONE OR A COUPLE OF PLANETS PREFERABLY MADE BY ONE OF THE WESTERN RPG GIANTS LIKE BETHESDA OR CDPR NOT EA
HM MAYBE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO ELITE DANGEROUS SANDBOX YOU CAN BE A SMUGGLER RUNNING IMPERIAL BLOCKADES JOIN UP WITH THE EMPIRE OR THE REBELLION TO RUN MILITARY MISSIONS AGAINST OPPOSING PLAYERS BE A PIRATE OUT FOR ONLY YOURSELF
WHAT WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO SEE IN A STAR WARS MMORPG

NOT ANOTHER STAR WAR MMORPG

KIDDING I WOULD TOTALLY BE INTO ONE THAT WAS STARSHIP BASED BUT GALAXIES AND SSTOR JUST WEREN'T MY CUP OF TEA
WELL BASICALLY I WOULD WANT STAR CITIZEN OR IT LEAST WHAT THE DEVELOPERS SAY IT WILL BE LIKE IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE WITH THE COMBAT SYSTEM OF KINGDOM COME DELIVERANCE
A STAR WARS THEMED STAR CITIZEN AND NO MAN'S SKY HYBRID ALL THE STAR WARS PLANETS AND MOONS WE KNOW OF ARE AVAILABLE TO TRAVEL TOO THEY ALL HAVE THEIR RESPECTIVE SPECIES AND FAMILIAR CHARACTERS THAT ARE FROM THERE YOU CAN FOLLOW ANY PATH YOU WANT JEDI OR SITH OR BOUNTY HUNTER OR SMUGGLER OR TROOPER ETC THE MAIN FEATURE IS IT'S ACTUALLY TWO GAMES ONE SET IN THE CLONE WARS AND ONE IN THE GALACTIC CIVIL WAR THAT WAY YOU COULD BE A CLONE TROOPER OR STORM-TROOPER OR A SEPARATISTS LEADER OR REBEL TROOPER YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT THOUGH SO YOU COULD BECOME AN AWOL CLONE OR AWOL JEDI OR FALL TO THE DARK SIDE AS A JEDI YOU CAN FLY TO EVERY PLANET NO PROBLEM
AN UPDATED REINCARNATION OF STAR WARS GALAXIES AND SELLING OUT DUMBING DOWN FOR THE MASSES
FOR ME AFTER PLAYING SSTOR FOR A WHILE I WOULD HAVE TO SAY HAVING LIGHTSABER COMBAT BE MUCH MORE HAVE THE STYLES MATTER MORE AND GIVE CONTROL TO HOW YOU SWING AND IMPLEMENT FORCE ABILITIES ON TOP OF THAT GIVING SMUGGLER AND BOUNTY HUNTER CHARACTERS BETTER WAYS TO USE COVER AND HAVE MORE OF AN FPS FEEL

BLDR I WANT FULL COMBAT IMMERSION
I THINK THE PEOPLE SAYING LIKE STAR CITIZEN ARE ON POINT THAT SAID THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE STAR CITIZEN HAS PROMISED TO IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY EVER WANT IN A SCI-FI AMMO FROM BOARDING ACTION TO CAPITAL SHIPS TO WHAT HAVE YOU AND WE STILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW THAT GOES
THIS IS WHAT I WANT GIVE FROMSOFTWARE THE STAR WARS RIGHTS AND LET THEM DEVELOP A STAR WARS SOULS GAME YOU MAY SAY LIKE I ONCE DID THE DARK SOULS THEME DOESN'T MATCH STAR WARS WELL I THINK YOU COULD HAVE YOUR SHRINE BE YOUR STARSHIP AND THE PLACES YOU GO INSTEAD OF BEING ACCESSED VIA BONFIRE INSTEAD BE ACCESSED VIA NAVIGATION MAPS AND BEACONS


THE STORYLINE COULD BE A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS BUT MY FAVORITE IDEA IS HAVE YOUR CHARACTER START OUT AFTER BEING EXILED FROM THE JEDI TEMPLE AND THE CHARACTER STARTS TO TRACK DOWN HOLOCRONS EACH HOLOCRON COULD BE GUARDED BY A BAD ASS BOSS AND THEN OFFER YOU AWESOME POWERS MAYBE LIGHT SIDE OR DARK SIDE DDK THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY


I JUST WANT THE BRUTALITY BEAUTY AND FIGHTING MECHANICS OF DARK SOULS TO COLLIDE WITH STAR WARS IN A AWESOME WAY


OTHERWISE GIVE IT TO BETHESDA AND LET THEM DO WHAT THEY DO BEST
I WANT AN OPEN WORLD THING WHERE I CAN PICK A CAREER I COULD END UP AS A REBEL SQUAD LEADER I COULD BE AN ASB AGENT I COULD BE A GRAND ADMIRAL I COULD BE A LINE TROOPER IF YOU CAN'T TELL I LOVE THE EMPIRE
NOT BEING
WATCHING THIS MADE ME WANT A STAND ALONE FILM ABOUT ORDER CALLED SIMPLY SIXTY-SIX
WOW THAT WAS GENUINELY AMAZING AND I USUALLY HATE FAN FILMS GOOD JOB OP
THAT NECK SNAP THO
GREAT STOP MOTION VIDEO I USED TO LOVE MAKING THOSE MYSELF

INTERESTINGLY THOUGH ACCORDING TO THE CLONE WARS THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF CLONE WARS SPOILERS S THE CHIPS IMPLANTED INSIDE THE BRAINS OF ALL THE CLONES THEY'D HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ATTEMPT TO KILL THEIR JEDI GENERALS

STILL NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT CANON AS IT MEANS STORIES LIKE THIS COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED EITHER WAY GREAT VIDEO SUPER SMOOTH AND NICELY DONE
HUH INTERESTING I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE EXPLICITLY SHOWN AND IDENTIFIED A ALTHOUGH WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO INFER THAT THEY EXIST FOR A WHILE
FUNNY IT DOESN'T LOOK DRUITH
TICKETS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPE RIGHT NOW THERE HAS BEEN NO WORD ON ANY OTHER REGION
I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT GO ON SALE TONIGHT GUESS OF THE UK BUT NO DICE

I ASKED AT CINEPLEX TONIGHT AND THEY HAD NO CONCRETE INFORMATION OTHER THEN A RUMOR THAT'S GOING AROUND THAT IT WAS SOMETIME LATER THIS WEEK
THE SERIES IS CALLED STAR WARS THERE TEND TO BE WAR ROOMS AND STRATEGISTS IN WAR
AT MY LAST JOB WHERE I HAD TO MANAGE A TEAM OF I WOULD HAVE STAR WARS MEETINGS WHERE WE STOOD AROUND OUR CONFERENCE TABLE AND HAD QUICK RAPID FIRE TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR OBJECTIVES WERE AND THEN BREAK I THINK NORMAL PEOPLE CALL THESE STAND-UP MEETINGS

I THINK WE NEED AT LEAST MORE OP
SO THESE HOLOGRAPHS SIMULATIONS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM ARE JUST A MORE ADVANCED VERSION OF SOMETHING THE MILITARY HAS BEEN USING SINCE BEFORE YODA WAS A PADAWAN YOU DO A MISSION BRIEF FOR ANYTHING MORE COMPLICATED THAN FEEDING YOUR BANCHA YOU'RE GONNA LAY OUT THE OPERATION ON SOME KIND OF MODEL OF THE OBJECTIVE THE QUICKEST AND DIRTIEST CAN BE A COUPLE PIECES OF STRING STICKS AND ROCKS SOME MATCHES OR KOOLAID POWDER FROM THE MRE MAYBE A COUPLE PIECES OF CARDBOARD WITH LABELS ON THEM MAYBE YOU'RE HIGH-SPEED AND YOU BUILD A WHICH IS JUST WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE A TABLE WITH RAISED SIDES CONTAINING A MESS OF SAND YOU MOLD AND PILE THE SAND TO RESEMBLE THE TERRAIN ON THE OBJECTIVE YOU'RE REQUIRED TO MANEUVER DOWN THIS DRAINAGE DITCH

IF YOU'RE REALLY YOU CONDUCT A ROCK DRILL WHICH IS A SAND TABLE ON STEROIDS I DROVE FOR A BATTALION COMMANDER FOR A WHILE AND WHEN WE WENT TO FT IRWIN THE BRIGADE STAFF PULLED IN A BACKHOE DRIVER TO PILE UP ENOUGH SAND TO RESEMBLE THE PIEFORT MOUNTAIN RIDGELIKE AND A COUPLE OF THE OTHER MAJOR HILLS ALONG THE AXIS OF ADVANCE LAID OUT ROPE AND LABELED MRE BOXES FOR KEY LOCATIONS OR ROUTES DAMN THING MUST HAVE BEEN YARDS ON A SIDE PICTURE ABOUT OFFICERS FROM DOWN TO LT WALKING AND TALKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE MISSION FROM DEPARTURE TO THE OBJECTIVE VARIOUS AND ALTERNATIVES

TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OP HOW MANY MORE SCENES LIKE THIS WELL I GUESS THEY'LL STOP WHEN THE WHOLE DAMN SERIES STOPS BEING ABOUT WARFARE
I WANT TO SEE NEW REPUBLIC OFFICERS IN CLEAN BRAND NEW OFFICIAL LOOKING UNIFORMS WITH WHITE ARMOR CLAD TROOPERS AT THEIR BACKS INSIDE OF CLEAN DURASTEEL MILITARY FACILITY ON A CAPITAL WORLD FORMING A PLAN I'M TIRED OF THIS HIDY HOLE SECRET REBEL THEME
I LOVE THESE SCENES THE ONE IN THE FORCE AWAKENS WAS GREAT
THE ANSWER IS
WE NEED ONE MORE ROGUE ONE MORE
I AGREE THEY SHOULD OOOO GROUP CHAT OR SKYPE FOR MAXIMIZED STUPIDITY
TO BE FAIR THE FORCE AWAKENS ONE IS THE WORST SCENE IN ANY MOVIE EVER SO I JUST COUNT I'M OK WITH
YOU LEFT OUT EPISODE
I THINK ABOUT THREE MORE AND THEN IM GOOD

AT LEAST
THERE WAS A SIMILAR SCENE IN PHANTOM MENACE TOO
DUNNO HOW MANY TIMES DO WE NEED TO SEE A DESERT PLANET SO FAR WE'RE
ITS CALLED A BRIEFING LETS SEE HOW OPS WILL GO WITHOUT THEM
I'M COOL WITH INFINITE TIMES
ALL OF THEM
BUT OP DON'T YOU LIKE YOUR NOSTALGIA
S S
I THINK THE POINT IS THAT THE DEATH STAR IS OVER DONE
FOR ALL WE KNOW THEY HAVE WEEKLY TEAM MEETINGS IN THE HOLOGRAM ROOM SO MAYBE THIS IS JUST A TINY PERCENTAGE OF HOW OFTEN THIS REALLY HAPPENS
AS MANY AS IT TAKES
SORRY BUT NOW YOU'RE JUST NITPICKING
MEMBER MON MOTHMA
WAIT A MOMENT THOSE ARE THE PRESENTS I WAS LOOKING FOR
THAT'S A TOP SHELF SANTA WHEN I WAS A KID THE SANTAS ALL HAD FAKE BEARDS AND SMELLED LIKE AQUA VELVA
SANTA YOU WILL HAND OVER YOUR TOY PRODUCTION TO THE FIRST ORDER OR BE MET WITH WRATH
WHAT A SAVAGE HOW DID SANTA MANAGE TO SMILE WHILE SHITTING HIMSELF OUT OF FEAR OF THE FIRST ORDER
CAPTAIN PHASMA AS A CHILD
GREAT TO SEE CHILDREN OF THE EMPIRE LOOKING UP TO THEIR PARENTS IT IS A SIGN OF GREAT PARENTING
THAT'S IT MY 2 YEAR OLD IS GONNA GET A SECOND SHOT AT WEARING HER BATGIRL COSTUME
SHE'S A REALLY CUTE KID
ISN'T SHE A LITTLE SHORT FOR A CLONETROOPER
SANTA BETTER WATCH OUT MAGICAL MEN WITH BEARDS ARE FROWNED UPON BY IMPERIAL TROOPS
HALACHA THIS IS ADORABLE

THAT'S A REALLY SPOT-ON SANTA
READ THAT AS FINN TAKE MY MONEY
THIS IS WHAT I WANT DISNEY LANDS STAR WARS AREA TO LOOK LIKE
WHOAAAAAAAAAA
THIS FAN SHOULD HAVE AN OFFICE AT THE PRESIDIO

REAL DEAL
WHERE'S THE OTHER LANDING LEG
DOES ABBA LAUGH


I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING A HIGHER QUALITY VERSION I'D LIKE A CLEARER LOOK AT HER FEET
BUDGET COSTUME IS HILARIOUSLY LAZY
LOOKS COZY MIGHT DO THE SAME THING HIS WINTER TO KEEP WARM
ABBA THE UH CPA
RAJA PABA DOA GOLA BOOKIE NIPPLE PINCH

FAMILYGUY IMAGES B REVISION LATEST CB
SOMEONE IS LIVING THEIR DREAMS IN A TINY WAY
GOT SUPER EXCITED WHILE MY BRAIN BELIEVED DESTINY WAS GETTING A STAR WARS VERSION UNTIL REALIZING THAT'S NOT A THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
I HATED JAR JAR TILL MY YEAR OLD NIECE WATCHED STAR WARS AND SHE SAID SHE LOVED HIM NOBODY EVEN ASKED HERALDRY SHE WAS JUST TELLING ME ON HER OWN SO I CAN TELL YOU LUCAS REALLY WON THE KIDS WHICH WAS HIS GOAL
IT OCCURRED TO ME RECENTLY THAT IF HAD BEEN A CREATURE OR SUBTITLED ALIEN I'D PROBABLY HAVE FOUND HIM MORE ENDEARING


WHAT DO YOU MEAN ONE OF THE MOST HATED HOW CAN PEOPLE HATE THE MAIN CHARACTER
DOES ANYONE FIND IT ODD A CLUMSY GOOFBALL IS MORE HATED THAN A MACHIAVELLIAN MASS MURDERER
I THOUGHT THIS WAS SY SNOOZLES FROM THE THUMBNAIL

I MEAN IF IT WAS THEN IT WOULDN'T BE WRONG EITHER
IT LOOKS LIKE A GREMLIN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS
I CAN SAFELY SAY THE MOST HATED
HE WORKED SO WELL ON ACW
WHY WOULD SNOKE BE THE MOST HATED CHARACTER
WHAT IS THERE A POINT TO THIS THREAD THAT I'M MISSING OR IS IT JUST A STATEMENT WITH NO PURPOSE
I HATE TO BE PEDANTIC BUT CLONE WARS AIRED ON CARTOON NETWORK BEFORE EPISODE III CAME OUT SO IT'S TECHNICALLY NOT A RECREATION OF THE OPENING CRAWL
I WONDER IF TICKET SALES WILL START LATER THIS WEEK SINCE THE UK SHOWING SEEMS TO BE A FEW DAYS AHEAD OF TIME
I JUST BOUGHT MINE FOR THE
WAIT PEOPLE ARE GETTING EARLY SHOWINGS AGAIN WHEN SHOULD I LOCK MYSELF OUT OF REDDIN TO AVOID SPOILERS
BEST TV SPOT YET I RECKON I LOVE THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN BAZE AND CHIRRUP MADE ME SMILE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THESE TWO ON SCREEN

GOD ROGUE ONE IS CLOSE
LOTS OF NEW FOOTAGE AT LEAST TO MY EYES
THE FORCE DID PROTECT ME

I PROTECTED YOU

BAZE CONFIRMED FORCE CHILD S
SHIT THAT WAS GREAT

FUUUUUCK I HAVE TO STOP WATCHING THESE GIVING SO MANY GREAT MOMENTS AWAY
I LOVE HOW THE REACT TO THE MISSILE IT LOOKS LIKE THE METAL GEAR REX
I NEED TO STOP WATCHING THESE ASAP
YEAH TIME TO STOP WATCHING THESE NOW FEEL LIKE THEY ARE STARTING TO GIVE AWAY THE GOOD MOMENTS
HERE WE GO SOME BANTER
ARE MORE LIKE FERRARIS IN SPACE
I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE COOL COLOR SCHEME AND USE OF LOGOS I WONDER WHAT AN WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE ALMOST LIKE A PODRACER BUT SLEEKER AND MORE OFFICIAL
HUGE FAN HERE TOO THIS LOOKS GREAT I'D SAY RENAULT WOULD BE COOL
I PERSONALLY WOULD HAVE GONE WITH THE GOLD ACCENTS TO MATCH THE FERRARI CARS OF OLD BUT U MORTICHRO IS CORRECT AN A-WING WOULD BE BETTER SUITED TO THE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE OVERALL DESIGN OF THE
DISNEY ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRAILER TO HOMECOMING WOULD BE SHOWING IN FRONT OF ROGUE ONE BUT MADE NO COMMENT ABOUT EPISODE VIII I THINK IT'S A SMARTER MOVE FOR THEM TO ONLY BE FOCUSED ON HYPING ROGUE ONE FOR NOW I'D EXPECT A TRAILER EARLY IN MAYBE AT AROUND MARCH JUST A GUESS THOUGH
SO I FIGURED THEY WOULD DO THE SAME THING AS THE FORCE AWAKENS

FALSE A GENERAL SPECULATION SINCE FFA HAD NO OTHER SW MOVIE RELEASING BEFORE IT IT WAS EASIER TO ANNOUNCE IT RIGHT AROUND THIS TIME

BUT WITH ROGUE ONE ABOUT TO LAUNCH THEY WANT ALL THE ATTENTION ON THAT MOVIE AND NOT RIGHT NOW

MOST HAVE GUESSED WE'LL GET SOME SORT OF NAME POSSIBLY AT THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR AND THEN A TRAILER AT CELEBRATION WHICH IS IN APRIL
OH MY GOD

IF ONE MORE PERSON ASKS FOR AN EPISODE VIII TRAILER BEFORE ROGUE ONE EVEN STARTS SELLING TICKETS I AM GOING TO EXPLODE
PRETTY SURE WE'LL GET NOTHING RELATED TO EPISTLE UNTIL ROGUE ONE IS OUT ON JUST LIKE WE DIDN'T GET ANYTHING FOR ROGUE ONE UNTIL FFA WAS OUT
I THINK THEY'LL FOLLOW WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST TWO FOR THE MOST PART MY GUESS FOR A TRAILER SCHEDULE WOULD BE

SHORT TEASER TRAILER SUPER BOWL SUNDAY EARLY FEBRUARY

LONG TEASER TRAILER CELEBRATION GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY 2 LATE APRIL EARLY MAY

SIZZLE REEL DCC MID JULY

THEATRICAL TRAILER RANDOM MONDAY THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL GAME W TICKET ANNOUNCEMENT MID LATE OCTOBER


DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE AN EPISODE TRAILER UNTIL AT LEAST CELEBRATION
I'VE SEEN NO RUMORS AROUND THE SUB AS OF YET ALTHOUGH I HAVE SEEN SPECULATION THERE'S NO POINT FOR THEM TO HYPE UP FOR VIII WHEN THE ALREADY ROLLING FOR ROGUE ONE
I WOULDN'T BET ON IT THE RELEASE OF TRAILERS FOR ROGUE ONE FOLLOWED THE PATTERN SET BY THE FORCE AWAKENS EXCEPT FOR THE BLACK FRIDAY TEASER THEY STILL MIGHT DO ONE BUT I WOULDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING EARLIER THAN APRIL
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TEASER TRAILER FOR VIII BEFORE ROGUE ONE STARTS THAT WOULD BE IDEAL
BAIL WIFE WAS THE QUEEN OF ALDERMAN THAT'S WHY LEIA IS ROYALTY
NOBODY KNEW ABOUT BIOLOGICAL MOTHER SO THAT'S NOT WHY SHE'S ROYALTY
I MEAN HOW MANY PRINCESSES OF IMMEDIATE IMPORTANCE DO YOU THINK THERE WAS ON THE DEATH STAR C3 PO IDENTIFIES HER AS PRINCESS LEIA TO LUKE AND THE FACT THAT SHE'S A PRINCESS AND HOT IS WHAT STANDS OUT TO HIM SO THAT'S WHAT HE CALLS HERALDRY ALSO YES ALDERMAN HAS ROYALTY SO I ASSUME SHE REALLY IS THE PRINCESS
OR IT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT HER EARLIER ON
AS FAR AS THE ALLIANCE GOES THE PRINCESS REFERS TO LEIA BECAUSE SHE IS A PRINCESS AND IS AN ALLIANCE LEADER SHE IS A PRINCESS BECAUSE HER ADOPTED MOTHER IS QUEEN OF ALDERMAN AND HER ADOPTED FATHER BAIL ORGANA WAS A SENATOR AND A LEADER OF THE ALLIANCE THERE ARE NO OTHER PRINCESSES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO THAT WOULD HAVE HAD ANY RELEVANCE TO LUKE AND HAN

IF YOU MEAN GEORGE LUCAS IS A HALL WRITER AND DIDN'T PLAN ANY OF THE MOVIES BEFORE ANY OTHER MOVIES THEN YEAH HE PROBABLY DID JUST MAKE AMYGDALA THE QUEEN BEFORE KNOWING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN REVENGE OF THE SITH
PLEASE TELL ME HE ALSO HAD TO DRINK FROM A SOLO CUP
ANOTHER GOOD RULE IS TO DRINK EVERYTIME A SKYWALKER WHINES EPISODES ARE A REALLY DIFFICULT STRETCH
YOUR FRIEND WAS WEAK AND FOOLISH LIKE HIS FATHER SO I DRANK HIM AWAY
IT'S NOT MY FAULT AND VARIANTS
HOW ABOUT A NEED TO MAKE JELL-O SHOTS THO
I ONCE DID A STAR WARS DRINKING GAME WHERE WE TOOK A SHOT EVERY TIME JAR JAR FIRST APPEARED IN A SCENE IN THE PHANTOM MENACE LESS THAN MINUTES IN WE'D NEARLY FINISHED THE BOTTLE AND HAD TO QUIT
HAR HAR
THERE IS ALREADY BASICS GRIEVOUS IN THE DARTH VADER COMICS
WIKI
STAR WARS REBELS HAS BROUGHT ENOUGH BACK
DO YOU HAVE A LINK TO THE PART OF THE MOVIE

WELL AVENGERS INFINITY WAR WILL BE THE FIRST HOLLYWOOD FILM TO BE SHOT ENTIRELY IN IMAX THE HUNGER GAMES CATCHING LAST MINUTES ARE IN IMAX AND THAT'S THE CURRENT LONGEST SEQUENCE

SO NO ROGUE ONE WILL NOT BE SHOT WITH IMAX THOUGH I'M SURE IT WILL BE WORTH IT I SETTLE FOR NOTHING LESS
HOOD PROBLEMS YOU CAN'T AFFORD IMAX JUST SIT CLOSER TO THE SCREEN
POSSIBLE STUPID QUESTION WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE SHOT IN IMAX
I HARDLY WATCH IMAX MOVIES SO I DONT KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS
JUST SOME OF THE SHOTS WERE FILMED IN IMAX BUT I'D STILL GO SEE IT THERE IF YOU CAN WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIE SCREENS BIGGER IS OFTEN BETTER
HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET SO I CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION
VERY INTERESTING I REALLY LIKED SEEING THE IN THE OCEAN AND THE IN THE STREETS ALMOST LOOKED REAL
IS THAT ALL CAKE OR IS MOST OF IT STRUCTURAL MATERIAL
I HOPE THERE ARE AT LEAST PEOPLE INVITED
THAT'S THE DOWNSIDE TO HAVING LIFE SUPPORT IN YOUR SHIP INSTEAD OF WEARING A SEALED SUIT

HAVE FUN IN THE VACUUM REBEL SCUM
ISN'T HE VISIBLE IN SOME EDITIONS OF THE FILM AND NOT VISIBLE IN OTHERS
BLINK OR YOU'LL MISS IT


DUDE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I BLINK I KEEP MISSING IT I'M BLINKING FURIOUSLY
FOR ALL THOSE BELIEVING THIS IS A SPECIAL EDITION ADDITION IT'S NOT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THERE WAS A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN THIS BEING IN THEATERS AND THEN HOME VIDEO AND EVEN THEN THE ONLY HOME VIDEO AVAILABLE WAS A PAN AND SCAN COPY OF THE MOVIE RECTANGULAR OR WIDE-SCREEN ASPECT MOVIE REFORMATTED TO FIT INTO A SQUARE ASPECT USED BY TELEVISIONS PEOPLE EITHER NEVER NOTICED OR FORGOT IT WAS A REVELATION WHEN THE WIDE-SCREEN COPIES CAME OUT MUCH MUCH LATER
IT'S IN ONE OF THE TRAILERS
WATCH V
AND IT'S DISCUSSED ON USENET OFTEN AS FAR BACK AS ON
GOD I LOVE THESE MOVIES BUT IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT FOR ME WHERE IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE EFFECTS WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT HOW OUTDATED THEY ARE
DELETED
IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE VERY DISTANT ASTEROIDS ARE JUST POTATOES
ONE OF MY FAVORITE FUN FACTS ABOUT EMPIRE STRIKES BACK IS THAT WE GET A RANDOM NEW TIE THAT NO ONE EVER NOTICES WHEN CAPTAIN NEDA GOES OFF TO REPORT TO VADER THE ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE EXECUTOR MOMENTS BEFORE SHOWS WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SINGLE TIE BOMBER LAUNCH AND FLY OFF OUT OF THE HANGAR BAY OF ONE OF THE STAR DESTROYERS APPARENTLY THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE TIE BOMBER CALLED THE TIE SHUTTLE REPLACING THE SECONDARY WEAPONS POD WITH A PASSENGER COMPARTMENT FOR WHEN YOU NEED TO GET SOMEWHERE IN THE FLEET BUT DON'T NEED A FULL LAMBDA SHUTTLE
AND MICHAEL BAY STILL HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS
I REMEMBER GETTING GOOSEBUMPS WATCHING THIS IN THE THEATER GOOSEBUMPS STILL THERE LAYING IN BED WATCHING ON MY PHONE THANKS FOR BRINGING OUT THE KID IN ME
MAN THAT SCORE WHAT FFA IS MISSING
I CAN CONFIRM IT'S IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE MOVIE AS WELL AND NOT A SPECIAL EDITION CHANGE
IND ITS SO DENSE
IF I REMEMBER LOST STARS WELL THIS EJECTING GUY ISN'T CANON ANYMORE LOL
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT AN ENTIRE GAME DEVOTED JUST TO THE PREQUEL BUT YES I'D LOVE TO SEE CLONE WARS OR PREQUEL STUFF INCORPORATED INTO BATTLEFRONT
I HONESTLY WISH THERE WAS PREQUEL ERA STUFF IN THE FIRST GAME THERE'S NO REAL REASON NOT TO INCLUDE MAPS SPANNING ALL THREE ERAS OR EVEN JUST THE ABILITY TO PLAY ON PLACES LIKE TATTOOING WITH CLONE WARS OR SEQUEL TRILOGY FORCES

ALSO I REALLY WANT TO SEE AMINO ON CURRENT GEN SYSTEMS THAT COULD BE OOOO COOL
I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO PLAY AS ASOKA IN BATTLEFRONT
I WANT ONE BATTLEFRONT GAME THAT IS THE CENTER FOR ALL MY BATTLEFRONT NEEDS RATHER THAN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ONES I'D LIKE A BF GAME WHERE ALL ERAS ARE INCLUDED THEY COULD EVEN ADD THE DIFFERENT ERAS VIA DLC EVERY HANDFUL OF MONTHS FROM THE ANCIENT ERAS TO THE OLD REPUBLIC ALL THE WAY TO THE SEQUEL TRILOGY ERA EVERYTHING

EACH ADDITION ADDS NEW GUNS MELEE WEAPONS MAPS CHARACTER MODELS TO USE AND ARMOR AND CLOTHES TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR PERSONAL CHARACTER WHICH CAN BE USED IN CUSTOM PRIVATE GAME SESSIONS WITH YOUR FRIENDS YOU SHOULD EVEN BE ABLE TO MAKE YOUR OWN CUSTOM HERO WHOSE MOVEMENT IS BASED ON THE DEFAULT ONES I COULD MAKE KYLE KATAR FOR EXAMPLE WITH DIFFERENT CLOTHING AND ARMOR PIECES I'VE UNLOCKED AND HE WOULD PLAY LIKE LUKE

ALSO WANT A FORGE MODE LIKE HALO S WITH THE ADDITION OF BEING ABLE TO SPAWN IPCS ENEMIES A THEATER MODE WOULD BE NICE AS WELL TO SAVE COOL AND FUNNY MOMENTS
I'D LIKE A BATTLEFRONT THAT RANGES ALL ACROSS CANON FROM EPS

PLACES I'D LIKE TO SEE
BABOO HEED
AMINO
GEOGNOSIS
UTAPAU
MUSTAFAR
DEATH STAR BETTER DONE THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW
CLOUD CITY FAVORITE CURRENT LOCATION
TAKODONNA
STARKVILLE BASE
I THINK THAT NEXT BATTLEFRONT WILL BE PREQUEL ERA BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MATERIAL FOR SEQUEL ERA
THE REASON THEY FOCUSED ON THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY FOR THE FIRST ONE WAS BECAUSE OF EPISODE COMING OUT SO THE CLOSEST THING THEY COULD DO ON THE TIGHT SCHEDULE WAS WHAT WE GOT MORE THAN LIKELY THE NEXT BATTLEFRONT WILL HAVE PREQUEL STUFF
NUMBER IT SHOULD NOT BE AN ENTIRE GAME MULTIPLE ERAS SHOULD BE PLAYABLE IN ONE GAME AS WE HAD IN BATTLEFRONT AND 2
YES AT THIS POINT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE CANON MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR A CLONE WARS PREQUEL GAME THAN THERE IS FOR A ACW GAME
NO THE EA BATTLEFRONT SHOULD INCLUDE PREQUEL NOT BE JUST PREQUEL
BASE GAME MOST OF THE CONTENT RELEASED FROM BATTLEFRONT PHASE OF THE CLONE WARS EPISODE STUFF

EXPANSION PACKS THE PLETHORA OF EPISODE STUFF




WOULD JAR JAR BE A HERO CHARACTER YOU CAN KILL
DUH
NUMBER EA SHOULDN'T HANDLE IT NOR SHOULD DICE THEY'VE PROVEN THAT WHILE THEY'RE GREAT AT GRAPHICS EVERY OTHER PART OF BATTLEFRONT IS LACKING DON'T BUY BATTLEFRONT 2 UNLESS THEY RELEASE MORE THAN FOUR MAPS AND AN OFFLINE MODE AND THE SEASON PASS IS UNDER
I DOUBT THEY WILL DO ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE PREQUEL HOWEVER I THINK WE WILL SEE STAR WARS REBELS LOCATIONS CHARACTERS AND PLENTY OF STUFF FROM EPISODE AND
THERE'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF PREQUEL CONTENT IN THE ORIGINAL GAME BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE A PREQUEL GAME NOT EXIST THAN BE THE MESS OF A GAME THE ORIGINAL IS NOW
I MEAN IF IT WASN'T EA IT BEEN IN THERE ORIGINALLY LIKE THE PREVIOUS GAMES
I WOULDN'T MIND A SMALL AMOUNT BUT IF IT WAS ENTIRELY PREQUEL BASED I WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED IN PLAYING IT PERSONALLY
YES IT WILL COST A LOT IT'S THE REASON WHY THEY ARE SHORT SAME THING WITH UBISOFT TRAILERS THEIR CINEMATICS ARE SHORT TOO I WAS KINDA CONFUSED WHY THEY DIDN'T USED THE SAME CINEMATICS IN AC EMBERS LOOK IT UP DIFFERENT STYLE OF CINEMATIC TURNS OUT THAT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE IT'S ALSO THE SAME REASON WHY THE TV SHOWS CLONE WARS AND REBELS LOOKS THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT THE OLD REPUBLIC THEY WOULD RATHER SHOOT IT WITH REAL SETS AND PEOPLE JUST TO PLAY SAFE
THE BLUR STUDIOS TRAILERS COST ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS PER MINUTE OF FOOTAGE A FULL SIZED MOVIE WOULD REQUIRE A HUGE BUDGET BUT FOR STAR WARS THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM

TROUBLE IS THE LACK OF DRIVE OR REAL DEMAND FOR SUCH A MOVIE MOVING AWAY FROM THE MORE TRADITIONAL WAY OF MAKING A MOVIE COULD BE AWESOME AND COULD END UP AS AN EXPENSIVE DISASTER EITHER WAY IT'D BE A RISKY MOVE ON THEIR PART
UNFORTUNATELY THE BEST THING ABOUT SSTOR IS THOSE CINEMATICS I WOULD LOVE FOR THEM TO DO A MOVIE WITH THOSE CINEMATICS BUT I DOUBT THEY WILLIAM
I'M PRETTY SURE I'VE READ IT COSTS OVER A MILLION DOLLARS FOR THOSE SHORT VIDEOS THAT SSTOR DOES SO I'M SURE A FULL MOVIE IS JUST TOO MUCH
HAS BLUR EVER DONE ANYTHING LONGER THAN ISH MINUTES ANY WAYS APART FROM HALO HALO WARS HALO WARS 2 CUTSCENES
LOVE IT IT'S VERY UNIQUE IN A WAY WE DON'T SEE WITH MUCH FAN ARTICLE
REPORT TO R EMPIREDIDNOTHINGWRONG SOLDIER
INTERESTING SNOKE THEORY
THE ANGUISH ON HIS FACE THE FEEDING TUBES UP HIS NOSE THIS IS AN AWESOME PIECE OF ART
THANK YOU THANK YOU
VERY NICE
I AM LIKING IT THE HATE THE ANGER THE SUFFERING HE LOOKS SO PATHETIC WITHOUT HIS MENACING MASK THE ONLY THING IS ARE THE EYE PUPILS THEY DON'T SEEM TO LINE UP CORRECTLY I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ME OR IT'S AN OPTICAL ILLUSION
LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN SEBASTIAN SHAW THAT BEING SAID I LIKE THE WAY YOUR GUY LOOKS BETTER HAS A LOOK TO HIM GOOD JOB
SMASHING
AN OLD MAN AND A TALKING FROG CONVINCE A FARM BOY TO MURDER HIS FATHER ON LIFE SUPPORT
DELETED
IT'S FANTASY WWII WESTERN SET IN SPACE
ONE OF THE MOST MOVIES OF ALL TIME THE SEQUEL IS OFTEN VOTED AS THE BEST MOVIE IN HISTORY A LOT OF IT ISN'T TRULY ORIGINAL BUT THAT IS ITS STRENGTH IT DIVES INTO YOUR DEEPEST JOYS AND FEARS AND MAKES A CLASSIC OUT OF THEM SET IN SPACE IT REMAINS IMMENSELY AND EASILY RELATABLE THE PREQUEL ARE GREAT ESCAPIST FICTION WITH GREAT IDEAS AND A DISTINCT VISUAL STYLE BUT POORER EXECUTION AND DELIVERY A CORNERSTONE OF POP FICTION THAT YOU OWE TO YOURSELF TO SEE AT LEAST ONCE
SCIENCE FICTION WITH COOL SPACE SHIPS ALIENS LASERS LASER SWORDS AND A COOL GROUP WITH LIMITED DEFINED MAGIC POWERS
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD I EXPLAIN IT TO THEM WHEN I COULD BE SHOWING THEM
I TELL THEM THE ORDER TO WATCH THE MOVIES
FANTASY ADVENTURE IN SPACE ALSO FUCKING LIGHTSABERS
FARM BOY GOES TO SPACE TO FIGHT WITH COWBOY AND MONKEY ALL TO SAVE BREAD BUNS FARM BOY JOINS A CULT LED BY AN OLD MAN WHO'S TURNED TO LAUNDRY BY HITLER AFTER THIS THEY JOIN A TERRORIST ORGANISATION AND BLOW UP A MILITARY FUNDED BASE
A YOUNG HEROS ADVENTURE IN SPACE TO RESCUE THE PRINCESS FROM THE BAD GUYS AND SAVE THE GALAXY

BUT IN REALITY I WOULD SAY YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN IT BUT SURELY YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT START WITH STAR WARS AND IF YOU LIKE IT JUST CONTINUE WATCHING IN THE ORDER THEY WHERE MADE
KILL THEM ALL
A NEW HOPE

A KID WITH ABANDONMENT ISSUES SETS OUT TO FUCK UP HIS ESTRANGED FATHERS BUSINESS
IT IS A WAR IN THE STARS AND THEY HAVE AIRPLANES WHAT FLY IN OUTER SPACE AND LASER SWORDS THERE IS A FAMILY LEGACY DRAMA AS A FOCAL POINT IT'S A FUN STORY BUT NOT WORTH TAKING SERIOUSLY
WITHOUT A DOUBT IT WILL INVOLVE DARTH MAUL PROBABLY NOT ASOKA DEFINITELY THOSE OWLS NOT SHOWN ON SCREEN BUT IT WILL ALSO HAVE DAVE FILION SITTING IN A HIGH-BACKED CHAIR STROKING A CAT
SOMEONE ON THE CREW WILL DIE
THEY BETTER START HAVING SOME ARCS SOON TO BUILD UP FOR THE FINALE BECAUSE THESE STAND ALONE EPISODES ARE DOING NOTHING FOR ME FAST
FOR SOME REASON I SEE THE CLIMAX OF ARC HAPPENING BEFORE THE SEASON FINALE BUT I COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG WE ARE SPECULATING HERE THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION BETWEEN MAUL AND THRAWN SO I LEAN TOWARDS EACH GETTING DEDICATED EPISODES INSTEAD OF CRAMMING BOTH INTO A SINGLE FINALE I COULD ALSO POTENTIALLY SEE A SWITCH BACK AND FORTH THOUGH OR A FIRST HALF LATER HALF SITUATION STORY HAS BEEN A SLOW BURN AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF WHATEVER HAPPENS WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT PACING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR THIS SHOW SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING HOW EVERYTHING PLAYS OUT

I FEEL LIKE THE ACTUAL FINALE WILL REVOLVE AROUND MAUL AND HOPEFULLY CONCLUDE HIS CHARACTER'S INCLUSION IN THE SERIES PART OF ME THINKS THIS WILL BE A SOLELY SITUATION AND ANY SORT OF CONFRONTATION WILL HAPPEN VIA COMIC I PREDICT AN EXTENDED BATTLE EZRA CONFRONTING HIS DEMONS MAYBE KANAN GETS KILLED BUT MAUL SLINKS OFFICIAL PERHAPS EZRA HAS TO MAKE A FINAL DECISION AND CHOOSES KANAN WHICH PROMPTS MAULS DEPARTURE TO SEEK GOOD OL OBI

I THINK THE BEND IS DONE WITH FOR THE SEASON MAYBE HE WILL HAVE A SMALL PART BUT I DON'T FORESEE IT I THINK WE HAVE SEEN WHAT WE NEED TO SEE FROM HIM AND IT IS BACK TO THE WINGS WITH HIM

MY HOPES EITHER SOMEBODY DIES OR SOMETHING OF SUBSTINANCE WILL HAPPEN THE REBELS HAVE BEEN TOO SUCCESSFUL THEY NEED A BAD LOSS TO PUT THEM IN THEIR PLACE THIS SERVES THREE PURPOSES A THE REBELS DON'T SEEM LIKE PLOT ARMORED DEMI GODS WHO CAN'T FAIL B THE EMPIRE CAN ACTUALLY BE A THREAT AGAIN AND COUNTY THRAWN IS GIVEN THE TRIUMPHS HIS CHARACTER DESERVES I HOPE ITS A NARROW ESCAPE FOR THE REBELS THIS NEEDS TO BE THE EMPIRE STRIKING BACK AFTER TWO AND A HALF SEASONS OF INEPTITUDE

MY EXPECTATIONS WHATEVER HAPPENS I EXPECT THE FINALE TO BE TENSE VISUALLY APPEALING AND HAVE IMPORTANT EVENTS HAPPEN IF REBELS IS DOING TWO THINGS RIGHT IT'S THE SEASON OPENINGS AND FINALES THAT BEING SAID I PREDICT THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF ISSUE OF CONTENTION FOR SUPER FANS IF THIS FINALE FOLLOWS SUIT WITH LAST IE INQUISICOPTERS VADER EYEBROWS PACING WHETHER OR NOT ASOKA SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEFINITIVELY KILLED ETC
THERE'S STILL ANOTHER HALF OF SEASON MORE EPISODES IN THIS HALF

THRAWN WILL PROBABLY AMBUSH THE REBELS WHEN THEY TRY TO TAKE DOWN A FACTORY ON LETHAL PROBABLY IN THE NEXT HALF
ONE OF THE GHOST CREW IS GONNA DIE
MAUL V OBI WAN
THRAWN WILL PROBABLY BE DEFEATED DEFEATED IN THIS INSTANCE MEANING NOT BEING ABLE TO EXERCISE HIS MASTER PLAN OF DEFEATING THE ENTIRE REBEL ALLIANCE IN ONE FELL SWOOP BEFORE BEING SENT TO THE UNKNOWN REGIONS

MAUL WILL LIKELY FACTOR INTO IT

WE MIGHT FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ASOKA

PROBABLY SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CONDORS AND BEND ALSO

MAYBE THE REVEAL OF THE SITH LORD IN THE HOLOCRON

MORE OF FLIRTATION WITH THE DARK SIDE
I FULLY EXPECT THRAWN TO DIE EITHER BY HAVING HIS STAR DESTROYER BLOWN UP WHILE HIM ABOARD OR BY A LIGHTSABER THROUGH THE CHEST AS A HOMAGE TO HIS LEGENDS DEATH BUT ALL BAD GUYS IN REBELS WHO DON'T SURVIVE INTO OTHER WORKS PERISH ALL THE INQUISITORS DIED THRAWN IS PROBABLY GOING TO DIE
I HOPE BEND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT

GIANT LION TURTLES WITH ALL THE ANSWERS KIND OF RUIN THINGS
I WOULD SAY YES BECAUSE PALATINE WANTED ALL OF THE SEPARATISTS GONE SO IT WAS JUST THE NEW GALACTIC EMPIRE WITH GRIEVOUS BEING THE DROID GENERAL THAT PUTS HIM AS PRIME TARGET TO GET RID OF NOW THAT REALLY MAKES ME WANT TO SEE A DARTH VADER VS GENERAL GRIEVOUS FIGHT
WAS GRIEVOUS A PUPPET ON THE SAME LEVEL AS THOSE KILLED BY VADER IN REVENGE OF THE SITH

YES RECALL THAT IT'S PALATINE WHO GIVES THE REPUBLIC THE JEDI THE INTEL ON GRIEVOUS LOCATION AFTER ORDERING GRIEVOUS TO MOVE THE SEPARATIST LEADERS HE WANTED TO ISOLATE AND DESTROY THE GENERAL WHILE MOVING THE SEPARATIST LEADERS INTO POSITION TO BE TAKEN OUT LATER
IT JUST SEEMS MORE LOGICAL TO HIS PROGRESSION THAT HE'D HAVE VADER TIE UP THE LOOSE END THAT IS THE GENERAL AND MOVE ON I BELIEVE IN THE NOVEL I COULD BE TOTALLY MISTAKEN THE REASON PALATINE TOLD ANAKIN THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE GENERAL ON UTAPAU WAS SO THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD ACTUALLY SEND ANAKIN TO FINISH HIM OFF NOT JUST ANAKIN SAYING SHEE SAYS I SHOULD GO THIS STRATEGY SATISFIES SIMIOUS IN THE IDEA THAT ANAKIN WAS A WORTHY APPRENTICE BY DEFEATING HIM AND TYING UP ANY LOOSE END THAT THE JEDI COULD HAVE FOUND WERE HE ALIVE
GRIEVOUS WAS CERTAINLY PLANNED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE PICTURE

PLAN WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL IN ROTS DOOK IS KILLED BY ANAKIN GRIEVOUS IS REMOVED CLEANING UP LOOSE ENDS ORDER HAPPENS EMPIRE IS BORN THE ONLY ISSUES BEING YODA AND SURVIVE AND ANAKIN BECOMES ROASTED AND TOASTED

I LIKE TO IMAGINE HIS IDEAL SCENARIO PLAYS OUT LIKE THIS

ANAKIN KILLS DOOK HAPPENS
2 IS KILLED BY DOOK FIRST OR IS LEFT BEHIND ON THE INVISIBLE HAND LEAVE HIM OR WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT AND SUCH DOESN'T HAPPEN
FREE OF INFLUENCE PALATINE HAS EVEN GREATER CONTROL OF ANAKIN AND HIS ROLE ON THE JEDI COUNCIL POSSIBLY ALREADY MAKING HIM DARTH VADER AT THIS POINT DOESN'T HAPPEN THE SAME WAY
PALATINE ARRANGES FOR ANAKIN TO BE THE ONE WHO KILLS GRIEVOUS THUS BEING THE HERO WHO ENDS THE WAR HAVING KILLED DOOK GRIEVOUS AND ALSO THE SEPARATIST LEADERS ON MUSTAFAR ANAKIN HAS A LOT OF POPULAR SUPPORT AND ADMIRATION DIDN'T HAPPEN
ORDER JEDI RENDERED EXTINCT YODA POSSIBLY DEAD AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF SOMEHOW IT GETS TO BE PALATINE VADER VS YODA SOME HAPPENS
OUR NEW EMPIRE PALATINE IS IN CONTROL OF THE EMPIRE WITH DARTH VADER PUBLICLY STILL THE HERO ANAKIN SKYWALKER AS A RALLYING FORCE FOR ORDER DOESN'T HAPPEN INSTEAD WE HAVE SCARY VADER IN SUIT

GRIEVOUS WAS A SEPARATIST LEADER AS WELL AS THE GENERAL WASN'T HE THEREFOR I ASSUME HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE ONES TO DIE SO THE WAR COULD END CLEANLY
THE THING I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION IS THAT PREVIOUS WAS THE CATALYST FOR ORDER AS LONG AS GRIEVOUS WAS ALIVE THE CHANCELLOR WOULD RETAIN ALL THOSE DELICIOUS EMERGENCY POWERS POWERS HE'D HAVE TO GIVE UP ONCE GRIEVOUS WAS ELIMINATED WITH GRIEVOUS DEAD THERE WAS NO LEADER UNIFYING THEM SURE ACW SHOWED A FAIR FEW ADMIRALS AND GENERALS BUT THEY MOST LIKELY WOULD DESCEND INTO INFIGHTING OR WITH A CENTRAL BRANCH OF OVERSIGHT MISCOMMUNICATION WOULD PLAGUE THE DIMINISHING SEPARATIST ARMIES THE REASON PALATINE WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH KILLING THE PROTECTORS OF THE GALAXY WAS TO HIDE BEHIND A PLOT OF A COUP FRAME THE JEDI FOR AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AND HAVE THEM ELIMINATED THIS COULDN'T BE DONE WITH GRIEVOUS STILL ALIVE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OP UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES NO I DON'T IF OBI WAN FAILED IT WOULD PUT ANAKIN UNDER MORE STRESS AND ANGER TOWARDS THE COUNCIL FOR NOT LETTING HIM GO WITH HE MAY DO SOME VERY RECKLESS THINGS BUT ULTIMATELY THE COUNCIL WOULD SEND MORE JEDI TO FIGHT GRIEVOUS UNTIL THEY GOT HIM IF OBI WAN FAILED IT WOULD MOST CERTAINLY HAVE BENEFITTED PALATINE IMMENSELY IN GAINING CANAKINS FAVOR BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WITH GRIEVOUS ALIVE HE'D EXECUTE ORDER AND KNIGHT ANAKIN AS VADER TO SEND HIM AFTER GRIEVOUS
PREVIOUS WASN'T A JEDI OR A FORCE USER PREVIOUS IS THE ONE WHO SENT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CIS TO MUSTAFAR AT REQUEST I IMAGINE THAT PALATINE EXPECTED TO EITHER DIE TO PREVIOUS OR TO THE CLONES FAILING THAT PREVIOUS FIRST RESPONSE TO THE CLONES ATTACKING WAS TO LITERALLY RUN TO HIS SHIP TO ESCAPE PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THOSE WERE HIS ORDERS

WOULD WANT HIM KILLED I ASSUME NO BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DOUBT CARED IF HE DID DIE MY GUESS IS HAD PREVIOUS BEEN ALIVE HE'D BE USED AS A LEADER TO PUT DOWN REBELLIONS ON CIS WORLDS THEN MAYBE USED AS AN ASSASSIN AFTER THAT
YES HE'S A MAJOR THREAT
NOW I WANT TO SEE AN ALTERNATE TIMELINE WHERE ANAKIN HAS TO ELIMINATE THE SEPARATIST COUNCIL THAT WAS PROTECTED BY GRIEVOUS
HONESTLY HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE PITTED VADER AND GRIEVOUS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO SEE WHO CAME OUT ON TOP HE DID THE SAME THING WITH AN OTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE IN THE DARTH VADER COMICS
WHO CARES
NAILED IT
AAEKXCJ
PRETTY BUGGY ON MOBILE FUN THOUGH
NOW I CAN FULFILL MY DREAM OF BEING A REBEL PILOT
I MADE MY SELF A FOREST TROOPER HETP
I'M A STAR WARS HETP
THAT'S A NEAT SITE
FUN
HERE IS MINE
I'M A STAR WARS CARTOON


BY OFFICIAL DOES THAT MEAN IT WAS ACTUALLY CREATED BY DISNEY LUCASFILMS
I DON'T THINK THIS IS IN ANY WAY OFFICIAL
SOMETHING ABOUT THESE NOSES SERIOUSLY CREEPS ME OUT
I MADE ME A
I THINK I DID GOOD
DID SOMEONE HERE NEED JEDI TRAINING
LOUD INHALE EXHALE NOISES
CAUSE I'M HERE TO KILL UH I MEAN HELP YOU LEARN SOME NEW JEDI TRICKS HEHE
LOUD INHALE EXHALE NOISES


AND I JUST WASTED OVER AN HOUR PLAYING ON IT GOOD TIMES
THESE ARE SO CUTE
IS IT CANON
DELETED
I DON'T CARE FOR THE STYLE
I LOVE IT

HERE'S MY CHARACTER
MEDIA LARGE

THANKS FOR THE DOWNVOTES
WHERE ARE THE LAST
WHY CAN'T WE CLICK ON DROID
OFFICIAL DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT IS AFFILIATED WITH LUCASFILM IN ANYWAY IT IS STILL COOL
THEY'VE ALL SEEN SOME SHIT
IT'S PRETTY AWESOME I REALLY HOPE YOU ADD WOOKIEE SOMETIME SOON TOO
THE LACK OF A SLAVE GIRL OUTFIT FOR MEN IS TRIGGERING
HOW COME I CANT SELECT DROID
NOT THE AVATAR I WAS EXPECTING
QQ NO PUREBLOOD
BECAUSE IT'S A GIANT GALAXY SO MANY PLACES TO EXPLORE BY THE TIME THE EMPIRE IS IN POWER DOES THE GALAXY START TO FIND MORE OUT IN THE UNKNOWN REGIONS BUT REALLY IT'S UNKNOWN BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL LEARNING ABOUT MORE PLACES IN KNOWN SPACE
BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER BEEN FORMALLY CHARTED SOME PEOPLE HAVE EXPLORED BITS AND PEACES OF IT BUT NO COMPREHENSIVE MAP EXISTS
WIKI
IN LEGENDS IT WAS BECAUSE THE GALAXY'S GRAVITATIONAL PULL MADE TO EASIER TO EXPLORE THE RIGHT HALF OF THE GALAXY RATHER THAN THE LEFT
QUESTIONS LIKE THIS ARE GREAT FOR R MAWINSTALLATION
IF THEY WEREN'T UNKNOWN THEY WOULD BE KNOWN


IT'S JUST UNEXPLORED SPACE FROM A STORYTELLING PERSPECTIVE THEY NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE UNIVERSE SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP BRINGING IN NEW STUFF
BECAUSE NO ONE CAN BE ARCED TO EXPLORE THE PLACE
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE WESTERN AMERICA WAS IN LIKE THE SOUTH IT WAS UNKNOWN IN THE FACT THAT IT WAS STILL WILD MOSTLY UNSETTLED AND RULED BY REGIONAL FACTIONAL GOVERNMENTS PEOPLE KNEW SHIT WAS OUT THERE AND EVEN KNEW WHERE A LOT OF THAT SHIT WAS BUT THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF SHIT THAT HADN'T BEEN PROPERLY DOCUMENTED OR CHARTED OR WHATEVER

UNGOWN AS IS IN IF YOU GO OUT THERE YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN
FLYING THROUGH HYPERSPACE AIN'T LIKE DUSTING CROPS BOY
REMOVED
TIME WILL TELL
THE CANTINA ISN'T THE KIND OF PLACE THAT CALLS THE AUTHORITIES OVER A BAR FIGHT THEY'RE A PLACE FOR OUTLAWS AND SCOUNDRELS THEY'D LOSE BUSINESS IF THEY CALLED IN STORM-TROOPER EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GOT SHOT OR HAD AN ARM SLICED OFFICIAL WHEN HAN SHOT GREED HE JUST TOSSED A FEW COINS TO THE BARTENDER THEY'RE SMART ENOUGH NOT TO CALL UNWANTED IMPERIAL ATTENTION

OTHER THAN THAT WE DON'T SEE JEDI OPENLY OPERATING ON IMPERIAL WORLDS THERE MAY STILL BE INQUISITORS BUT THEY WOULDN'T BE ON TATTOOING OR HOTH OR BAVIN

VADER TAKES A PERSONAL INTEREST IN LUKE BECAUSE HE'S A SKYWALKER HE DOESN'T WANT TO KILL HIS ONLY SON HE WANTS TO TURN HIM
I ASSUME THEY ARE ALL GONE BY THE TIME OF ANH

DAVE FILION SAID SO IN AN INTERVIEW
ARTICLES PAGE
DELETED
LOL ANOTHER WAY REBELS IS JUST UNNECESSARILY FUCKING WITH CANON

FILION CONTINUITY PUTS YOU IN CHAINS SOMETIMES SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

I HATE THAT THIS IS HOW HE LOOKS AT THE CANON LIKE A PRISON FOR HIS IDEAS AS IF THEY'RE SOMEHOW BETTER THAN WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN DON'T GET ME WRONG FILION DESERVES CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE FOR CLONE WARS BUT ALL THIS STUFF HE'S PUTTING IN REBELS IS JUST IRKING ME TO NO END
I REALLY HOPE HE DOESN'T DIE YODA AND COUNTED ON HIM TO BRING BACK THE JEDI I DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF HE PASSES THE TORCH TO REY OR SOME BULLSHIT I WANT LUKE TO FORM A NEW GENERATION OF JEDI WITH HIM AT THE HELM I COULD NOT PICTURE REY FORMING THE NEW JEDI ORDER BY HERSELF
IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS ARC WILL BE IN WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER IDEA AFTER OF WHETHER IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE OR NOT

PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM REBUILD THE JEDI ACADEMY WITH REY AND CO AT END OF IF THEY MADE A HE COULD DIE SIMILAR TO THE OLD KING DUDE IN PLANET OF THE APES OR YODA SURROUNDED BY JEDI OR SOMETHING HAVE A BIG STATUE AT THE TEMPLE OF HIM

BUT FOR NOW IT'S TOO HARD TO TELL
NONE THAT I CAN THINK OF IF THEY DO KILL HIM THEY SHOULD DO SO IN A WAY WORTHY OF HIM BUT I WOULD BE REALLY ANNOYED IF THEY WENT AND HAD ALL OF THE OT TRIO MURDERED
WHATEVER HAPPENS WE NEED TO SEE LUKE SUCCESSFULLY REBUILD THE JEDI ORDER THAT'S SOMETHING I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE AND FEELS LIKE A GOAL OF THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE FORMULAIC AND HAVE EACH OF THEM DIE EACH OF THE MOVIES

THERE'S NO REASON FOR LUKE TO DIE UNLESS THEY'RE REMAKING OBI WAN OR YODA UNLESS HE DIES IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT I DON'T WANT HIM TO DIE WE JUST SPENT A MOVIE WAITING FOR HIM
I HOPE THAT HE'LL HAVE A HAPPY ENDING AND EVENTUALLY BEGIN A SUCCESSFUL NEW ORDER OF JEDI IT'D BE NICE TO SEE HIM DIE OF OLD AGE AND NOT JUST BE MERCED FOR THE FEELS

LUKE SHOULD BE REMEMBERED AS AN ENDURING HERO WHO CHANGED THE GALAXY FOR THE BETTER
THEY ALREADY WHACKED HAN SO UNLESS THERE'S SOME BIG DRAMATIC DEATH SCENE TO REY AT THE END OF EPISODE IX THEN THERE'S NO REASON HE COULDN'T SURVIVE AND HELP HER REBUILD THE JEDI ORDER WITH HERALDRY

SHIT IF BEN SKYWALKER TURNS BACK TO THE LIGHT BY THE END IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE HIM MAKE AMENDS WITH LUKE AND HELP HIM AND REY RESHAPE THE JEDI INTO THE KIND OF WORLDLY WANDERING ORDER THEY ALWAYS BEEN RATHER THAN THE ASEXUAL WEIRDOS LITERALLY LIVING IN AN IVORY TOWER THAT WE SAW IN THE PREQUEL
NOT NECESSARILY DIE BUT HE WILL DISAPPEAR IN SOME WAY

IF DISNEY PLAN ON MAKING A NEW TRILOGY AFTER THIS ONE WHICH I THINK THEY WILL IT WOULDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE TO HAVE ANY OF THE OLD CAST MEMBERS IN IT LETS ASSUME ITS OVER YEARS UNTIL THEY DO IT WHICH WOULD BE LIKELY

MARK HAMILL WOULD BE TO OLD IMO AND IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE FOR HIM TO HAVE A BIG ROLE IN VIII AND IX AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE IS GONE IN X HE MAY NOT DIE BUT WE WILL SEE THE LAST OF LUKE IN VIII OR IX IMO
WHILE THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION WE CURRENTLY LACK I DON'T THINK LUKE SHOULD DIE DURING THE STREET

NOT ONLY IS HE THE LAST JEDI BUT IT'S HIS DESTINY TO RESTORE THE ORDER SURE HE DID TECHNICALLY BRING IT BACK BUT IT WAS DESTROYED BY THE KNIGHTS OF REN AND THE FIRST ORDER

IF LUKE DOES DIE HOWEVER HE CAN STILL GUIDE REY THROUGH THE FORCE ASSUMING HE LEARNED THE FORCE GHOST TECHNIQUE BUT I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO STAY ALIVE DURING THE TRILOGY
NOT MUCH REASON TO KILL HIM OFFICIAL HE NEEDS TO LIVE TO SEE HIS DREAM COME TRUE OTHERWISE IT'S ALMOST PATHETIC TO KICK HIM WHEN HE'S DOWN
I THINK LUKE SHOULD BE THE YODA OF THE AJO WITH BEN AND REY AND HIS SECOND IN COMMANDS
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED LUKE ISN'T ALLOWED TO DIE UNTIL A NEW ORDER OF JEDI HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY ESTABLISHED BRINGING BACK THE JEDI IS HIS PURPOSE NOT THOUGH SHE WILL BE THE FIRST OF THE NEW GENERATION
ALTHOUGH I HATE TO ADMIT IT THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN THERE WILL BE NO MORE LUKE SKYWALKER EITHER MARK HAMILL WILL GET TIRED OF THE ROLE OR THE STORY WILL DEMAND THE DEATH OF A MENTOR AND THE MAIN CHARACTERS TO BEGIN TO GROW ON THEIR OWN HOWEVER THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE WILL NECESSARILY DIE BY THE END OF EPISTLE IX IF THEY CONTINUE THE MAIN SAGA TO EPISTLE X AND BEYOND WE MAY SEE OR MORE MOVIES WITH LUKE IN THEM IN REALITY IT'S FAR TOO EARLY TO TELL WE HAVEN'T HEARD A WORLD COME OUT OF MOUTH AS LUKE FOR ALMOST YEARS WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DIRECTION THE SAGA WILL GO IN WITH EPISTLE SO SPECULATING AT THIS POINT IS REALLY JUST WISHFUL THINKING
THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THEY COULD GO WITH THINGS EITHER WAY AND WE HAVE NO IDEA AT LEAST FROM THE MOVIE WHAT HIS CHARACTER IS LIKE NOW I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SPECULATE

AS TO THE ACTUAL QUESTION OF SHOULD THEY I THINK THEY SHOULD DO WHATEVER THEY THINK MAKES THE BEST MOVIE IF THEY'RE GOING TO KILL HIM OFF IN SOME CONTRIVED WAY JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MOVE ON FROM HIS CHARACTER THAT WOULD SUCK BUT IF THEY CREATE A GREAT MOMENT WITH ALL THE FEELS THEN THAT'S GREAT TOO
REY KILLS HIM IN EP TO TURN TO THE DARK SIDE
NO HE SHOULDN'T IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SAY THAT BUT IF HE DOES DIE HE REALLY DOESN'T BECAUSE FORCE GHOSTS ARE A THING
IF THEY KILL HIM IN A SMART PLAUSIBLE WELL WRITTEN WAY I'LL BE HAPPY

IF THEY MADE HIM SURVIVE IN A SMART PLAUSIBLE WELL WRITTEN WAY I'LL BE HAPPY TOO

I JUST WANT A SMART PLAUSIBLE WELL WRITTEN STORY THAT MEANS NO STUFF
YES I HOPE THAT HE JUST DIES PEACEFULLY SOME TIME AFTER THE TRILOGY IT WOULD ALSO GIVE HIM TIME TO ACTUALLY BEGIN REBUILDING THE JEDI ORDER BEFORE HE DIES
YES KILLING ANOTHER OT CHARACTER WOULD FEEL CHEAP
IF THEY DECIDE TO USE THEM IN A STORY YES UNTIL THEY ARE PUBLISHED THEY ARE JUST NUMBERS ON A HARD DRIVE SOMEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA
NOT UNLESS THEY ARE EXPLICITLY DEFINED AS CANON BAD BATCH UTAPAU STORY REELS AND THE OTHER UNFINISHED STUFF FROM THE CLONE WARS ARE CANON BECAUSE DAVE FILION AND OTHERS HAVE SAID THEY ARE WE HAVE KNOWN FOR A WHILE THAT THE SIEGE OF BANDALORE WAS CANON EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T SEE IT IN THE CLONE WARS WE JUST BARELY GOT A GLIMPSE OF IT IN THE ASOKA NOVEL

I THINK ITS SAFE TO SAY IF IT DIDN'T EXPLICITLY APPEAR ANYWHERE CANON OR ISN'T EXPLICITLY DEFINED AS CANON BY LUCASFILM THEN IT IS NOT CANON UNTIL WE SEE IT OTHERWISE
AS THE PABLO SAYS

WHEN YOU ASK IS IT CANON THE ANSWER MEANS DO OTHER STORYTELLERS NEED TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT THAT'S ALL THE ANSWER MEANS

PABLOHIDALGO STATUS
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NO THEY AREN'T CANON

HOWEVER MATERIAL IS BEING LIFTED FROM UNDERWORLD AND IS BEING USED IN THE NEW CANON
POTENTIALLY

CHURCH OF THE FORCE CAME FROM UNDERWORLD THEY WERE IN THE FORCE AWAKENS AND SEEMINGLY IN ROGUE ONE

PABLO SAID DARTH PLAGUERS NOVEL WON'T BE CANONISED BECAUSE OF HOW IT CONFLICTED WITH IDEAS ONE OF THOSE IDEAS WAS THAT PALATINE WAS SPURNED BY A WOMAN WHICH CAME FROM UNDERWORLD

ALTHOUGH NOT PRESENT IN ANY STORY DAVE FILION SAID THERE IS A CANONICAL EXPLANATION AS TO WHY ANAKIN APPEARS YOUNG AS A GHOST THAT WAS GOING TO BE EXPLORED IN THE YODA ARC IN THE CLONE WARS AND HAS A LITTLE SOMETHING TO DO WITH YODA PLANTING THAT SEED IN ANAKIN THEN
FINALLY ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE GETTING A CHANCE IN HOLLYWOOD
SHE'LL MAKE A GREAT CHEWIE
WILL WE SEE THE FATEFUL CARD GAME WHERE HAN BEATS LANDO AT A GAME OF HABACUC AND WIN THE FALCON OR DO THEY NEED TO BE OLDER
REALLY HOPE THAT CLARKE WILL BE A OR TOGRUTA
WHAT A YEAR FOR CHILDISH GAMBINO
IS IT ME OR DOES THIS LOOK MORE LIKE THE CAST OF A YOUNG LETHAL WEAPON MOVIE
ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT BLONDE WOMEN IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE SOMETHING SOMETHING GEORGE LUCAS HAS A THING FOR BRUNETTES
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A MORE PERFECT CHOICE FOR LANDO ALDEN DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE HARRISON FORD BUT DONALD GLOVER LOOKS ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE BILLY DEE WILLIAMS

EDIT FOR THOSE PEOPLE CLAIMING I'M A TRUMP SUPPORTER RACIST I'M GOING TO LINK TO THIS COMMENT WHERE I COMPARE THEIR FACIAL FEATURES CHIN NOSE EYEBROWS HAIR AND COMPLEXION AND ADMIT THAT NOW I CAN SEE HOW DIFFERENT THEY REALLY ARE BUT STILL ADMIT THAT THEY LOOK EERILY SIMILAR
I THINK IT'D BE GREAT IF SHE WAS THE VILLAIN
WHO'S EMILIA CLARKE PLAYING AND HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'LL DIE
I REALLY REALLY WANT DANI AUDI TO PLAY BIEN NUB
I THINK IT'S FUNNY HOW I CARE MORE ABOUT THE TWO THAT AREN'T HAN SOLO
LANDO FALLS FOR DAENERYS STORM-WORN OF THE HOUSE TARGARYEN FIRST OF HER NAME THE UNBURN QUEEN OF THE ANDALE AND THE FIRST MEN KHALEESI OF THE GREAT GRASS SEA BREAKER OF CHAINS AND MOTHER OF DRAGONS

DAENERYS DIES DUE TO EMPIRE

LANDO SAD GOES INTO SELF EXILE

SETS UP ABANA MINING CO INC AKA CLOUD CITY
THEY SHOULD TOSS THIS IDEA AWAY AND MAKE A KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC TRILOGY
I WOULD LIKE TO FORNICATE WITH ALL OF THEM ESPECIALLY DONALD
EMILIA CLARKE REALLY

I FEEL HER PERFORMANCE IN GOT IS PRETTY BAD JUST READING LINES INSTEAD OF ACTING THE CHARACTER IS SHE BETTER IN THE OTHER MOVIES
I THINK THEY SHOULD ALSO DO A STAR TREK TNG ORIGINS FILM AND HAVE DONALD PLAY GEORDIE
HAN LANDO AND THE CHICK THAT WILL DOUBLE-TIME THEM BOTH
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE HERE AREN'T EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE BUT THE MORE I HEAR ABOUT IT THE MORE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

HONESTLY I'M SUPER HYPED FOR THIS MOVIE AND THINK IT WILL BE PHENOMENAL I STOPPED THINKING IT WAS A BAD IDEA WHEN THE DIRECTORS WERE ANNOUNCED
SO IT'S A HAN TRIO GET IT

I'LL SEE MYSELF OUT
THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL HATE THE MOVIE CAUSE HARRISON FORD ISNT PLAYING HAN SOLO I GUARANTEE IT
SO HAN LANDO AND AND CHEWBACCA
MF DONGLOVER IS GONNA BE LANDO HETP

EDIT GUESS THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR TRYING TO BE FUNNY
EMILIA CLARKE CHARACTER PERDITION ASOKA

IN THE TIMELINE OF THIS MOVIE SHE WOULD BE A ROGUE OUT ALONE IN THE GALAXY PERHAPS LURKING IN THE SAME HAUNTS AS A YOUNG BRASH HAN
INDEED

FOR A MOMENT I WASN'T SURE IF THIS WAS R STARWARD OR R BISEXUAL

I I

TOO GOOD LOOKING REALLY
REMINDME THIS MOVIE IS A TERRIBLE IDEA AND IS GOING TO END UP BEING TERRIBLE
SHE'S SO PRETTY
HOPEFULLY ALL THE CAST BEYOND THIS POINT ARE UNKNOWNS
NOT TO MENTION PHIL LORD AND CHRIS MILLER AT THE HELM SHIT IS GONNA BE AWESOME
MAN HOBIE DOYLE HAS SURE MOVED UP FROM THEM COWBOY PICTURES THE STUDIO REALLY CHANGED HIS IMAGE
LET'S PICK THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE WE CAN FIND BECAUSE LOOKS SELL MAD JEALOUS
I KNOW THERE'S NOT MUCH REASON FOR IT BUT

I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS
I'M REALLY JUST NOT INTERESTED IN THIS MOVIE AT ALL
LOOKS FAMILIAR
I'M SO HAPPY GAMBINO IS MAKING MOVES IN THE MOVIE INDUSTRY EVER SINCE THAT SPACE MOVIE MARTIAN I THINK I THOUGHT HE WAS PRETTY DECENT ATLANTA IS FUCKING AWESOME TOO CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW HE DOES IN THIS ONE
STILL RATHER HAVE EWAN AND OBI WAN

HAN ISN'T A HERO IT'LL BE A HEIST MOVIE
EXCITED AS FUCK
I GIOTTO BE HONEST I DON'T REALLY CARE WHO PLAYS THESE CHARACTERS PLEASE JUST WRITE A DECENT BLOODY STORY

STOP RELYING ON NOSTALGIA SET PIECES RECOGNISABLE FACES AND JUST WRITE A STORY YOU WANT TO TELL NOT SOME MESSY BALL OF FEELING AND EYE CANDY
ANYONE ELSE THINK IT'S WEIRD THAT WE'VE GOT AT LEAST 2 CHARACTERS WHOSE STAR POWER WILL OUTSHINE HAN SOLO HIMSELF DOESN'T THAT SEEM OFF
PIC LOOKS LIKE A STOCK PHOTO FOR SMILING BLACK MANUAL IT IS TERRIBLE
I STILL CAN'T GET OVER DONALD GLOVER
THE LORDS WORK THE LORDS WORK
R TITLEGORE
SO IM GUESSING BRIA THARE IS A CANNON CHARACTER AGAIN
MPH LOINS
TROY AND KHALESSI IN THE MOORRRNNNINNNGGG
HE DOES LOOK LIKE A YOUNG JASON MAMA THERE
BLAH
WHAT OPTIONS ARE THERE FOR EMILIA ROLE LOVE INTEREST LOVE INTEREST SISTER ALL OF THE ABOVE
MPH
WELL TWO OF THEM AT LEAST
WHO'S THE GUY ON THE RIGHT OF QUEEN DAENERYS
MY PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH KOOL AID
DELETED
COULD SHE BE SANA SOLO FROM THE COMICS
AT LEAST ONE OF THEM CAN ACT
SO WILL THIS BE A LANDO ORIGIN STORY I HOPE SO
EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS
SIX SEASONS AND A MOVIE
I DUNNO DONALD GLOVER LOOKS CHRONICALLY DEPRESSED
I REALLY REALLY REALLY HOPE THIS MOVIE IS GOOD
SO BORING
I STILL DON'T THINK THIS IS A MOVIE THAT EVEN NEEDS TO BE MADE WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR NOT
WHICH IS HAN NONE OF THEM LOOK LIKE HIM
I'M BETTING EMILIA GONNA PLAY PRINCESS LEIA AND IF SHE IS I HOPE THE MOVIE DOESN'T END UP LIKE TERMINATOR GENIUSES WHERE EMILIA CLARKE PLAYS THE FEMALE LEAD FROM A FRANCHISE'S ORIGINAL MOVIES AND THE MOVIE'S PLOT FUCKS UP THE FRANCHISE'S CONTINUITY
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE CALM DOWN OP
HOW OLD ARE THE CHARACTERS MEANT TO BE IN THIS MOVIE IT'S NOT LIKE HAN SOLO WAS OLD IN A NEW HOPE I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE AT MIDNIGHT WHEN IT COMES OUT BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL LIKE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN YOUNG HAN SOLO IN THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY I KNOW THIS ISN'T EXACTLY AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT BUT I PERSONALLY THINK BOBA FETT IS MORE DESERVING OF A STAND ALONE MOVIE THAN HAN SOLO MOSTLY BECAUSE BOBA HASN'T BEEN EXPLORED ALL THAT MUCH ON SCREEN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT GUY IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE HAN ANTHONY INGRUBER IS WAY BETTER THAN THAT GUY
ANYONE ELSE SUDDENLY THIRSTY FOR A COLT
I'LL PROBABLY SKIP THIS ONE
EMILIA CLARKE IS GOING TO RUIN THAT MOVIE
I LIKED IT BETTER WHEN MOVIES HAD INTERESTING LOOKING PEOPLE WHO COULD ACT GOOD NOW AN AMERICAN APPAREL ADAPTATION OF
NOT LOVING THE EMILIA CLARKE CASTING JUST PERSONAL PREFERENCE BUT I LIKE STAR WARS WITH LESSER KNOWN ACTORS SHE'S JUST SO ICONIC FROM GOT
I'M SURPRISED NO ONE HAS POSTED THIS YET BUT THIS BUT DONALD GLOVER LANDO HAS JUST RELEASED A NEW SONG AND IT FUCKING ROCKS

HE GOES BY THE NAME OF CHILDISH GAMBINO AND THIS IS REDBONE

I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THIS SONG IN A LANDO MOVIE BECAUSE LIKE LANDO IT JUST SOUNDS SO SAUVE AND COOL
PUTTING HIM IN A WHITE SHIRT CONFRONT OF A WHITE BACKGROUND WAS DUMB
I THOUGHT THE MAIN FEMALE LEAD WAS GOING TO BE A BLACK WOMAN AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SANA SOLO FROM THE COMICS
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL SARCASM
THIS IS FUCKING TERRIBLE
I'M ACTUALLY PRETTY DISAPPOINTED SHE'S RULED OUT ANY TERMINATOR SEQUELS SHE KICKED ASS AS SARAH CONNOR ALTHOUGH NOBODY WILL TOP LENA HEADED SORRY LINDA HAMILTON
THIS MUST BE THE NEW DISNEY PC FORMULA
EHRENREICH DOESN'T HAVE EYES IT'S KIND OF OFF-PUTTING HOPEFULLY HE GETS THE VOICE RIGHT DIFFERENT VOICE IN ACW MADE QUITE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE HE WAS THE SAME GUY AS IN THE MOVIES ALTHOUGH THE DIFFERENT PERSONALITY WAS ALSO A MAJOR FACTOR
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HER TITS IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE
I DON'T WANT IT
DELETED
IS IT JUST ME OR IS ANYONE LOOKING AT THIS AND GETTING A FFA FLASHBACK
CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS TO BE A CRITICAL FLOP
I HOPE DONG LOVER IS MORE LIKE TROY AND LESS LIKE HIMSELF IN THIS MOVIE I REALLY HATE HIS REAL LIFE ATTITUDE
I'M WEIRD FOR NOT BEING EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE AREN'T I I NEED TO DO A MARATHON OR SOMETHING
OH WAIT THEY ARE GOING TO REBOOT THE FORCE AWAKENS
GIT RID OF GLOVER PLEASE THANK YOU
DELETED
YEAH LET'S MAKE THEM BEAUTIFUL SO AS TO DISTRACT FROM THE HOMOGENOUS CORPORATE BRAINWASHING THAT IS THE FILM INDUSTRY
WITH THE WAY THEY TREATED THE DARK TOWER MOVIE I'M SURPRISED HAN ISN'T BLACK
HOW MANY GOOD BOY POINTS WOULD THIS COST ME
THAT IS AWESOME I'M ENVIOUS
THAT IS INCREDIBLY COOL
SAW SPACE BALLS THOUGH IT WAS CANON

I THINK I NEED TO KNOW HIS THIS CONVERSATION WENT
SPACE BALLS FIRST WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS CANON

DARFUR

ANYHOW HOW DID SHE LIKE A NEW HOPE WHAT ORDER ARE YOU VIEWING THE MOVIES IN
THERE WAS SOME GUEST COMMENTATOR ON THE STAR WARS MINUTE PODCAST WHO DID THE SAME THING AS A KID SAW SPACE BALLS WELL BEFORE HE SAW ANY STAR WARS MOVIES AND FOR YEARS THOUGHT SPACE BALLS WAS STAR WARS

SOME PEOPLE JUST MISS SOME CULTURAL MARKERS AS KIDS FOR WHATEVER REASON I KNOW IN MY HOUSE BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE IMMIGRANTS AMERICAN POP CULTURE WAS JUST NOT ON THEIR RADAR EVEN WITH ALL THE ADVERTISING FOR THE SPECIAL EDITION AND PREQUEL RELEASES IF I HADN'T STUMBLED UPON IT ON MY OWN I ALSO WOULD HAVE GROWN UP WITHOUT EVER HAVING SEEN IT

EDIT I CAN'T WORDS
WAS ALSO TRYING TO GET MY LADY FRIEND TO GET INTO STAR WARS SHE ASKED ME THE PLOT OF THE MOVIES TO WHICH I EXPLAINED THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IT'S NOT SIMPLE IT'S ABOUT A FALLEN HERO MAKING BAD CHOICES ABOUT REDEMPTIONS ABOUT HOW OTHERS FIGHT AGAINST A CONQUERER OF THE GALAXY

SHE TOLD ME IT SOUNDS RETARDED


SIGH
THAT IT WAS CANON

WOULD HONESTLY TAKE SPACE BALLS OVER PLENTY OF THE EU SHIT
IN HER DEFENSE SPACEBALLS IS MORE CANON THAN THE PREQUEL
WOW THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING MANUAL THANKS FOR THE EXTRA PICTURES
I REALLY WISH THE NEW REPUBLIC UTILIZES ARMOR LIKE THIS IN THE NEW TRILOGY IT SEEMS MORE PRACTICAL TACTICALLY SPEAKING THAN THE TRADITIONAL REBEL INFANTRY ARMOR AND IT HAILS BACK TO THE OLD REPUBLIC
I GUESS I'LL ASK THE STANDARD COPLAY QUESTIONS

WHAT IS IT MADE OF

HOW MUCH DID IT COST

HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO BUILD

OTHER THAN THAT IT LOOKS FANTASTIC PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL TO THE SET FROM SSTOR
WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SUPER EXPENSIVE SIDESHOW ACTION FIGURES EXTREMELY DETAILED AND MUST FEEL SO AWESOME TO WEAR NICE JOB
WELCOME TO HAVOC SQUAD SERGEANT
NICE USE OF THE CERF STORMFIRE CLEAR SHOT
THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE THE HAVOC SQUAD EMBLEM
AS I WAS SCROLLING DOWN MY FRONT PAGE I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN R STARWARSBATTLEFRONT POST GREAT JOB FOOL ME ONCE SHAME ON YOU FOOL ME TWICE CAN'T GET FOOLED AGAIN
ALWAYS LOVE YOUR COSPLAYS U LAZYAARDVARK CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU FINISH YOUR FIRST ORDER TROOPER THIS IS MIKE FROM CHANCO
HEY HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH FOG ON THE VISOR
CERTIFIED
SO COOL
THAT IS AN AWESOME SUIT
I WANT TO WEAR THAT SO BAD AMAZING WORK
BLUE STEEL LOL
LOOKS AWESOME TOTALLY MOVIE STUDIO QUALITY MAKES ME WANNA GO BACK AND PLAY THE GAME
SEEMS KINDA WEIRD FOR IT TO BE SO SIMILAR TO ARMOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN THE FUTURE IS THERE A LORD REASON
IS THAT A CERF PISTOL O
SORRY I'M LATE I HAVE A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS AS TO HOW YOU MADE THIS

YOU MENTIONED THE COST OF THE PLASTIC PIECES DOES THAT MEAN YOU ORDERED THEM PREMADE OR DID YOU JUST ORDER SHEETS THAT YOU THEN FOLDED SCULPTED TO MAKE THE ARMOR PUZZLE
IF YOU BOUGHT THEM PREMADE WHERE
IF YOU MADE THEM YOURSELF HOW
HOW DOES THE INSIDE OF THE HELMET LOOK LIKE
IS IT JUST A BIG PLASTIC DOME OR IS THERE SOME FOAM TO HOLD YOUR HEAD TIGHT AND STOP YOUR EYES FROM SLIPPING AWAY FROM THE VISOR
YOU TALKED ABOUT FANS WHERE DOES THEIR POWER COME FROM I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE A CLONE TROOPER HELMET LIKE THAT HENCE THE QUESTIONS WITH A LITTLE COMPUTER INTEGRATED ON MY BACKPLATE OR BEHIND MY HEAD FOR COOL EFFECTS AND VISION AND OTHER USELESSNESS AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD SOMETHING SIMILAR

IF YOU'VE USED ONLINE GUIDES TO MAKE THIS COSTUME AND YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE ANSWERING ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS COULD I AT LEAST HAVE SOME LINKS TO THEM WHENEVER I LOOK FOR HOW TO MAKE STORM-TROOPER ARMOR ONLINE I ONLY EVER FIND THINGS THAT INVOLVE PAPER OR PLASTIC SHEETS SO THIN THEY LOOK LIKE SHINY PAPER YOUR ARMOR HAS VOLUME TO IT AND I LIKE THAT A LOT
I HATE THE HAVOC TROOPERS BUT THIS IS A GOOD COSTUME
IT SUCKS FOR US PEOPLE THAT WE CAN'T MAKE THIS AWESOME STUFF

I WOULD PAY GOOD MONEY TO HAVE SOMEONE MAKE ME ARMOR LIKE THIS
GOT TO LOVE HOW EVERYTHING IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE IS A COPY TWEAK OF SOMETHING A THOUSAND YEARS PRIOR AND NOTHING REALLY NEW EVER COMES OUT OF THIS UNIVERSE
MARK AFTER LEARNING HE HAS SECONDS OF SCREENTIME OF COURSE I'LL SHOW UP TO THE PHOTOSHOOT

HARRISON THE MINUTE HE WAS FINISHED FILMING HIS SCENES PEACE OUT EVERYONE
REMEMBER WHEN WE THOUGHT DOHMNALL GLEASON WOULD PLAY SON HE DOES LOOK THE PART IN MY OPINION

AND MAN DOES HE HAVE A ROCKING BEARD
SAY CHEESE

ALL CHEESE

LUKE STARES INTENTLY
MARK HAMILL REALLY DOES LOOK SHORT FOR A STORM-TROOPER HERE
POEXPHASMA CONFIRMED BOYS
IS IT ME OR DO I SENSE SOME SEXUAL TENSION BETWEEN OSCAR AND GWENDOLIN
GWENDOLIN CHRISTIE AND OSCAR ISAAC AGREEING TO STRIKE IF THEY BOTH GET PUT ON A BUS AGAIN
I LOVE THAT MARK IS TAKING IT SERIOUSLY AND THE REST REALLY AREN'T ADAM IS EATING FOR GODS SAKE THIS IS A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE
I WAS GUTTED WHEN I FOUND OUT DOMHNALL GLEESON WOULD BE PLAYING HUX HE MADE A GREAT MEMBER OF THE RESISTANCE POSSIBLE JEDI

BUT KUDOS TO HIS ACTING SKILLS HE DOES PLAY THE PART WELL
ADAM DRIVER IS A TALL MOCO

GWENDOLIN IS YUUUUUGE
HAHA OSCAR AND GWENDOLIN ARE SUCH GOOD SPORTS ABOUT THEIR HEIGHT DIFFERENCE ALTHOUGH I THINK OSCAR ISN'T EVEN THAT SHORT LAST I HEARD HE WAS BUT GOOGLE ALSO SAYS HE COULD BE SO WHO KNOWS ANYONE COULD LIKE LIKE THEY'RE 2 NEXT TO HER
SUCH A TALENTED CAST SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT ABRAMS BUT HIS CASTING ABILITY IS INSANE SO HAPPY WE HAVE ALL OF THEM IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE
CAN SOMEONE DIAGRAM IT UP I SEE HAMILL ABRAMS REY AND JON BOY ANYONE ELSE
WHERE'S CARRIE AND HARRISON
YA OSCAR ISSAC IS LIKE ADAM DRIVER IS 2 ASCI MUST BE WEARING STILETTOS
TASTE IN SHIRTS IN ALWAYS FLAWLESS
HARRISON AND CARRIE AREN'T THERE THEY'RE SOMEWHERE COIN IT
I SEE SOME LOVE EYES GOING ON BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE
WONDERFUL
WHO'S THE GINGER AND THE DUDE NEXT TO ADAM DRIVER
THESE HIGHLY PAID ACTORS BEING PAID TO PRETEND TO BE NERDS
THE FORCE UNLEASHED
MARK HAMILL NOT JOINING IN BECAUSE HE HATES THE MOVIE
EVERY TIME I SEE GWENDOLIN CHRISTIE IT REMINDS ME OF THE MOVIE DEUCE BIGELOW MALE GIGOLO
CAN WE STOP CALLING THEM MAN TEARS JUST CALL THEM TEARS

AS FOR A KENOBI MOVIE I'D LOVE ONE ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE PRETTY BORING BECAUSE HE DOESN'T DO MUCH OTHER THAN HIDE OUT ON TAT FOR LIKE YEARS
WE SAW ENOUGH OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS I THINK REVENGE OF THE SITH DIDN'T CUT TO BLACK BEFORE WAS VISIBLY REALLY MESSED UP INSIDE ONSCREEN

YEAH HE PROBABLY DID HAVE SOME LOW TIMES WHILE WAITING FOR LUKE TO GROW UP THAT DOESN'T TO ME SEEM LIKE THE SORT OF SUBJECT MATTER THAN NEEDS TO BE ITS OWN STAR WARS FILM
HEY OP WOULD DARTH VADER BE IN THIS MOVIE WOULD HE AND OBI WAN SHARE SCENES


NOT THAT I KNOW OF BUT SENSIBLES ARE COMMON SCI-FI DEVICES THAT HAVE THIS EFFECT THE JUSTIFICATION USUALLY HAS TO DO WITH QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT OR SOMETHING I'M NOT SURE IF STAR WARS WOULD EVER WANT TO TOUCH INTO MIS USES OF PHYSICS DUE TO ITS MORE SETTING THE POINT ISN'T TO CONVINCE US THAT THE THINGS WE SEE IN THE MOVIES COULD HAPPEN WHEREAS A LOT OF SCI-FI DEPENDS ON THAT
THEY SEND THE SIGNALS THROUGH HYPERSPACE THEY BASICALLY COMMUNICATE THROUGH WORMHOLES
MAGIC
THERE IS ALSO NEVER A REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT TIME IS A FUNCTION OF GRAVITY AND THE DISCREPANCIES THIS WOULD CAUSE IN AGING AND LINEAR TIME PROGRESSION FOR THE STORIES
CAN'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS IN A LEGENDS BOOK OR CANON BUT I REMEMBER A MENTION OF HYPERSPACE RELAYS USED FOR COMMUNICATION
THEY HAVE FASTER THAN LIGHT TRAVEL I ASSUME SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS HOW IT WORKS
THEY CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN LIGHT IM ASSUMING THEY CAN MAKE THEIR TRANSMISSIONS TRAVEL EVEN FASTER
UH QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT MAYBE
I UNDERSTAND TRANSMISSIONS OCCUR THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED SUBSPACE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE DISTINCT FROM HYPER SPACE
IN CATALYST KRENNIC MAKES A POINT TO TALK ABOUT COMMON DELAYS IN HOLOVIDS
I JUST ASSUME THAT TECHNOLOGY IS SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED THAT THIS SORT OF THING IS AN ORDINARY ENOUGH OCCURRENCE THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER FEEL THE NEED TO QUESTION OR EXPLAIN IT
COMMUNICATION THROUGH SUBSPACE
I FIGURE IT HAS TO DO WITH SUCH SCI-FI TECHNOBABBLE STAPLES AS SUBSPACE AND HYPERSPACE BASICALLY BEING ABLE TO SEND SIGNALS ON SOME SORT OF POCKET DIMENSION WAVELENGTH WHERE THE RULES OF SPACE-TIME AND RELATIVITY ARE DIFFERENT

PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT IF ONE POSSESSED SUCH A POWER THEY COULD CONCEIVABLY ALSO WARP IT INTENTIONALLY SO AS TO SEND MESSAGES INTO THE PAST ETC ETC BUT LET'S ASSUME THERE'S A GOOD REASON WHY THEY CAN'T AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS AN OPERA ABOUT SPACE WIZARDS SO WHATEVER

I DON'T THINK THAT HE ACTUALLY WANTED ANAKIN TO GO TO UTAPAU HE JUST WANTED TO PUT THE IDEA IN HEAD SO THAT HE WOULD GET PISSED OFF WHEN THE COUNCIL REJECTED HIM
THE COUNCIL WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS OF PALATINE WHICH HE KNEW BY SUGGESTING THAT ANAKIN SHOULD GO HE'S MANIPULATING THE COUNCIL TO NOT LET HIM GO KIND OF A REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY THING HE'S ENSURING THAT ANAKIN WILL BE LEFT AT CORUSCANT WHILE IS AWAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE FOR PALAPATINE IN HIS PLAN TO GET ANAKIN TO FALL SO SPLITTING THEM UP IS IMPORTANT

THEN THERE'S ALSO OFC WHAT OTHERS HERE HAVE SAID ANAKIN WILL BE ANGRY THAT HE'S BEEN OVERLOOKED BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S JUST A BONUS TO PALATINE
HE KNEW THE COUNCIL WOULD RESIST HIM AND PALATINE COULD USE THAT INSTANCE TO TELL ANAKIN THAT THE COUNCIL DID NOT THINK HE WAS WORTHY
SIMIOUS KNEW WHAT THE COUNCIL WOULD SAY BOTH WITH THAT AND OTHER SITUATIONS DOING THAT PUTS DOUBT INTO MIND MAKING IT EASIER TO MANIPULATE HIM EVIL GENIUS THAT GUY
SO HE COULD KILL ALL THE TRADE FEDERATION BIGWIGS THE SAME ONES HE EVENTUALLY MURDERS ON MUSTAPHAR
ARRESTING HIM FOR BEING A SITH IS PROBABLY NOT LEGAL ARRESTING HIM FOR ORCHESTRATING THE WAR WOULD BE WELL WITHIN THEIR PURVIEW
HE ORCHESTRATED A GALAXY WIDE WAR THAT RAVAGED WORLDS AND KILLED MILLIONS
WHAT THEY ATTEMPTED WAS A COUP

EDIT TO THE DOWNVOTERS DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT A COUP IS THERE ARE JUSTIFIABLE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE EXAMPLES NERDS
HE ORCHESTRATED A WAR TO COMMIT TREASON AND MUTINY CAUSED BILLIONS TO DIE LEVELED CITIES ON MANY PLANETS AND WAS ILLEGALLY CONTINUING HIS TERM
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAD ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT EVEN IF PALATINE HADN'T KILLED THE JEDI MASTERS AND DECIDED TO BE ARRESTED PEACEFULLY I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT ANYTHING WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT ANY DIFFERENT THE GALAXY AT LARGE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT A SITH WAS THEY HAD BEEN THOUGHT TO BE EXTINCT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS EVEN IF THEY HAD HEARD OF THE SITH IT WAS PROBABLY IN THE CONTEXT THAT THEY DIDN'T GET ALONG WITH THE JEDI AND THAT'S ABOUT IT ON THE OTHER HAND THE SENATE WOULD HAVE SEEN THE ACTIONS LIKE A MILITARY COUP SIDED WITH PALATINE AND THE JEDI WOULD HAVE STILL ENDED UP DEAD NO MATTER WHAT ANAKIN OR THE JEDI DID AT THAT POINT IN THE GAME THEY WERE DOOMED
HINDU DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY HE AND THE COUNCIL WERE ESSENTIALLY PERPETRATING A MILITARY COUP THE EVEN SPOKE EARLIER IN THE MOVIE ABOUT POTENTIALLY HAVING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE IF PALATINE DIDNT STEP DOWN AND THEY HAD TO REMOVE HIM WHEN THE WAR ENDED
EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE EXTENT PALATINE HAD SHAPING THE WAR THEY STILL WOULD HAVE DONE IT CAUSE WHAT'S LEGAL DOESN'T MATTER AS MUCH AS WHAT'S RIGHT HAVING AN EVIL SPACE WIZARD FROM A LINE OF EVIL SPACE WIZARDS WHO HAVE FOR MILLENNIA BEEN THE FOES OF THE JEDI ORDER TAKING CONTROL OF A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH REASON TO ARREST KILL HIM
NONE IT WASN'T THE WILL OF THE FORCE
THE FACT THAT PALATINE WAS A SITH MEANT HE WAS THE MOST LIKELY SUSPECT TO BE MASTER AND THE ORCHESTRATOR OF THE CLONE WARS THE JEDI HAS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE HE WAS GUILTY OF TREASON
PALATINE DID NOTHING WRONG
THEY HAD NO EVIDENCE THEY WERE MOVING BASED ON THEIR OWN PREJUDICE AND THEORIES
YOU DON'T NEED A RIGHT IN AN UPRISING OR REBELLION THAT'S WHY IT'S A REBELLION
HE MANIPULATED AND ASSASSINATED SEN KIM AND THE GRAN GRAN SEN
YOUR ALL THAT REMAINS OF THEIR ANCIENT RELIGION RELIGION IS THE KEY WORD THE GALAXY AT LARGE DISTRUSTED THE JEDI AND THE JEDI WERE A SECRETIVE SECT THE GALAXY NOT KNOWING WHO OR WHAT THE SITH WERE MADE THE JEDI PRETTY SCREWED THEIR MOVE WAS ILLEGAL

HE WAS ON MUSTAFAR CAUSE HE WAS A PART OF THE SEPARATIST LEADERSHIP AND THEN HE DIED THAT'S IT
WHO ISN'T SNOKE
NUMBER
THE WRITERS INTENTIONALLY PLACED THE FOREMAN OF THE TECHNO UNION THERE ALMOST AS IF TO SET UP A POTENTIAL CHARACTER ARC YES

YOU KILLED YOUR WHOLE THEORY THERE SNOKE AND EPISODE WEREN'T EVEN THOUGHT OF AT THAT TIME PLUS LUCAS VISION OF EPISODE WAS NOTHING LIKE FFA AND SNOKE DOESN'T EXIST IN LUCAS DRAFT OF EPISODE SNOKE WASN'T INVENTED UNTIL RECENTLY BY PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EVEN WRITE EPISODE
HOW DO YOU THINK GENERAL AUDIENCES WOULD REACT TO IT BEING REVEALED THAT HE WAS THIS BACKGROUND CHARACTER WITH THREE LINES OF DIALOGUE ALL ALONG
R STARWARSSPECULATION
WHAT AM I KALO REN WAT INDEED
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE ONTO SOMETHING OP
I LOVE THE BANTER BETWEEN VADER AND PALATINE AT THE END
I DON'T USUALLY CARE FOR SPOOFS ON YOUTUBE BUT THIS WAS REALLY WELL DONE I LIKED THE TIMING AND HOW THEY DIDN'T RESORT TO A SLEW OF CHEAP JOKES GOOD BANTER BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS
PALPS I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY HOMEBODY
IRON SQUADRON KIND OF MADE IT CLEARER ACTUALLY HE WANTED TO DRAW OUT THE REBEL LEADERSHIP AND END THEM IN A SINGLE STRIKE HE'S LETTING THEM GET SMALL VICTORIES BAITING THEM TO COME AND GROW A LITTLE MORE BOLD SO THEY FINALLY OVEREXTEND AND HE CAN SLAM THEM INTO THE GROUND WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THEM SULKING BACK TO THEIR HIDDEN CELLS AND REBUILDING HE KNOWS THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY FIGHT A DRAWN OUT WAR WITH AN ENEMY WHO USES HIT AND RUN TACTICS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM THINK THEY CAN TAKE YOU ON EVEN TERMS BEFORE DESTROYING THEM AND ANY HOPE THEY HAVE OF DESTROYING YOUR EMPIRE

GIVEN THE RESPECT THEY'VE GIVEN HIM SO FAR I FULLY EXPECT HE'LL HAVE A VICTORY EPISODE WHERE ME TEARS APART PHOENIX SQUADRON AND FORCES THE MAIN CAST TO BE ON THEIR OWN AGAIN I'VE HEARD THE IDEA THAT THE REBEL SYMBOL MAY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN MEMORY OF PHOENIX SQUADRON WHICH HAS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE SYMBOL AS A RALLYING CRY BECAUSE THEY GET DEFEATED BUT WE'LL HAVE TO SEE
WHY THE ONLY PUZZLE WORTH SOLVING OF COURSE THE COMPLETE TOTAL AND UTTER DESTRUCTION OF THE REBELLION

I WOULD ALSO SAY HE UNDERSTANDS THE VALUE OF PHOENIX SQUADRON SPECIALLY OF HERA KANAN AND EZRA HE HAD BEEN STUDYING THEM CLOSELY AND JUST GOT TO SEE AT WHAT LENGTHS HERA IS WILLING TO GO TO CRIPPLE AND DENY ASSETS TO THE EMPIRE INCLUDING SACRIFICING HER HERITAGE AND HOME I THINK HE WILL MAKE A TRAP BY LEADING THE PHOENIX INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO GREAT BLOWS TO THEMSELVES REBELLION IF THEY WISH TO SURVIVE EITHER WAY HE WOULD WIN
MY GUESS IS THAT THE LAST FEW EPISODES OF SEASON WILL BE HIS PLAN COMING INTO FRUITION I GOT SATO DYING AND A LOT OF REBEL FORCES GETTING THE AX BECAUSE OF ABILITY MOST OF THE MAIN CAST MAY SURVIVE BUT EZRA MAY BE A STEP OR 2 CLOSER TO HIS DARK SIDE CALLING AND I'M NOT EVEN CONFIDENT KANAN MAKES IT OUT ALIVE
THAT'S AWESOME BUT CLEAN YOUR TOILET
YOUR TOILET HAS SOME STUFF IT SHOULDNT HAVE
CLEAN YOUR SITH
HALACHA
SECRETLY INFORM SOMEONE IT'S REBELS AND HAVE THEM PLANT A TRACKER
HE WANTED TO KEEP HIS LEGS THIS TIME
MAYBE HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS LIGHTSABER ON HIM
I ASSUMED THAT HE WENT TO GO LOOK FOR HIM SOLO HE PROBABLY KNEW HE WASNT GOING TO BE SO EASILY FOUND ON THE SHIP
I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT AT FIRST HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS SPECIFICALLY HE SENSED JUST SOMEONE HE ENCOUNTERED A LONG TIME AGO

IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY HE LOOKS UP AT THE FALCON AND SAYS I SENSE SOMETHING A PRESENCE I'VE NOT FELT SINCE AND THEN HE WALKS OFFICIAL IT'S A BIT LATER WHEN HE REALISES WHO IT WAS AND TELLS LARKIN
HE PROBABLY GOT ANAKIN FLASHBACKS SO HE WENT TO HIS MEDITATION CHAMBER TO DRIVE THEM OUT
APPARENTLY HE WENT OFF SO HE COULD SURPRISE HIM WHICH HE DID PLOT AND WHAT NOT
I LOVE SPACEBALLS IT'S A SHAME NOT EVERYONE REMEMBERS IT
THIS FEELS LIKE IT'S A FRAME FROM MR PICKLES
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE THAT THAT DOES MAKE ME SAD BUT STILL THE FACT THAT HAN STILL RALLIES TO HELP GET BB BACK TO THE RESISTANCE SHOWS THAT HE HASN'T GIVEN UP ON LUKE OR WHAT HE CAN DO FOR THE CAUSE

AS A SIDE NOTE THE WAY HE DELIVERS THE LINE I KNEW HIM ALWAYS SOUNDS ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE HOW JACK SPARROW SAYS I KNEW HIM IN REGARD TO BILL TURNER MAKES ME EXPECT THAT HAN WILL FOLLOW UP THE LINE WITH AN EXPLANATION TO FINN AND REY ABOUT HOW EVERYBODY ELSE CALLED LUKE BOOTSTRAP OR BOOTSTRAP BILL
I DON'T THINK HE WAS ANGRY OR BITTER TOWARDS LUKE AT ALL HE KNEW LUKE VERY WELL AND WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE WAS HE KNEW HIS SON HAD TOO MUCH VADER IN HIM
I'M NOT SURE BITTER OR ANGRY TOWARDS LUKE TO ME HE SOUNDED SAD THAT HE HADN'T SEEN LUKE IN A WHILE
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN LIKE HE'S SAYING WELL HE WAS MY FRIEND
ECHOING WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID I NEVER TOOK THAT AS HAN BEING BITTER TOWARDS LUKE JUST FULL OF REGRET AT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED INCLUDING ARGUABLY HIS CLOSEST FRIEND BESIDES CHEWIE BLAMING HIMSELF FOR IT ALL AND WALKING OUT OF THEIR LIVES
IT WAS REY MENTIONING THE MAP THAT CHANGED MIND ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH HER AND FINN INITIALLY HE WANTED TO FIND LUKE TOO
I DON'T THINK HAN BLAMES LUKE THOUGH HE MAY QUESTION HOW WELL HE KNEW HIM AFTER LUKE GOES INTO HIDING BUT BEN TURNING THAT WAS MORE LEIA AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOT EXPLAINING TO BEN ABOUT THEIR FAMILY'S PAST
MAN BREAKING THE NEWS THAT BEN HAD TURNED TO THE DARK SIDE TO HAN AND LEIA BEEN ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS HAD TO IN HIS LIFE
I DOUBT SINCERELY THAT HAN HELD ANY ANGER OR BITTERNESS TOWARD LUKE MAYBE INITIALLY BUT HE KNOWS THAT FAILURES WERE HIS OWN BY THE TIME BEN FELL TO THE DARK SIDE HE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS
AND NOW THEY WON'T SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN
THAT'S WHAT SNOW TROOPERS ARE FOR DUH
S
I HOPE IT FEELS LIKE STAR WARS

I HAVE NO IDEA WHY BUT EVEN THOUGH I ENJOYED FORCE AWAKENS A LOT AS A MOVIE I DIDN'T REALLY LOVE IT AS A STAR WARS MOVIE I GUESS PART OF IT WAS THAT SO MUCH TIME WENT INTO PAYING HOMAGE SETTING UP THAT I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THE MOVIE ACTUALLY ADDED ANYTHING NEW OF VALUE TO THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE AS I WATCHED I FELT LIKE BOXES WERE BEING TICKED AND DESPITE ALL THE COOL SHOTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU IT JUST DIDN'T GIVE ME THE FEELING OF AMAZEMENT OR WHATEVER THAT STAR WARS CONTENT OF ANY TYPE MOVIE CARTOONS GAMES OFTEN GIVE ME

I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO TO FEEL LIKE AN AWESOME STAR WARS EXPERIENCE THIS TIME AROUND BUT THAT'S WHAT I NEED IF IT EXPANDS ON THINGS LIKE THE GALACTIC LIFE UNDER THE EMPIRE A DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT OF THE FORCE BLIND GUY LOOKS SUPER PROMISING IMO CREATION OF THE DEATH STAR MAYBE WE GET SOME BRIEF INFO ON THE CRYSTALS OR SOMETHING I THINK IT CAN REALLY DO IT FOR ME
GOSH I HOPE THEY SPELL ROGUE RIGHT
THAT VADER DOESN'T MOW DOWN EVERYONE

I'D MUCH RATHER THAT MOST OF THE TEAM LEAD A SERENITY STYLE FINAL STAND AS AYN AND SOME OF THE TEAM HURRY TO GET THE DATA TO THE TACTIVE IV
AN EXTENSIVE SCENE OF THE EARTHSTAR GOING INTO HYPERSPACE
IND ROGUE
I AM REALLY HOPING THEY DON'T HOLD BACK WITH VADER IT WOULD BE A COLOSSAL MISTAKE IMO IF HE DOESN'T WRECK NEARLY EVERYONE AS OP SAID WHAT HE DOES IN THIS MOVIE WILL INFLUENCE HOW WE SEE HIM IN THE OT SO HE NEEDS TO BE MENACING AND MERCILESS

I DON'T THINK THEY WILL DISAPPOINT US IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER LUCASFILM IS STILL IN CHARGE DISNEY OWNS LUCASFILM BUT ITS STILL KATHLEEN KENNEDY AND LUCASFILM RUNNING THE SHOW

I ALSO HOPE DOES ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY MAKING MORE ANTHOLOGY FILMS AND MORE RISKY ONES AT THAT IF DOES GOOD MAYBE THEY CAN BRANCH OUT INTO KOROR OR SOMETHING OF THE LIKE IF IT JUST DOES OKAY THERE WILL PROBABLY BE MORE OT TIME PERIOD ANTHOLOGY FILMS LIKE BOBA FETT WHICH WOULD BE A LETDOWN IMO BUT I'D STILL WATCH IT
IT'S AFTER ROTS AND JUST BEFORE ANH I THINK IN THIS PERIOD VADER WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY POWERFUL AND VERY RUTHLESS I HOPE WE SEE HIM DECIMATE THE REBEL SCUM AHEM I'M EXPECTING IT TO BE MORE GRITTY THAN THE OT PT ST FILMS AND HAVE A MORE DESPERATE FEELING NO JEDI JUST ORDINARY REBELS

I HAVE MY TICKETS BOOKED AND I'M SUPER EXCITED
I HOPE AYN IS A THREE DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER AND THAT VADER IS CONFINED TO A TWO MINUTE SCENE TOWARDS THE END OF THE FILM
I WONDER HOW RUTHLESS DISNEY WILL LET HIM BE I HONESTLY DOUBT WE'LL SEE HIM GO ON A RAMPAGE AS AWESOME AS THAT'D BE
I WANNA HEAR DARTH ORIGINAL THEME

THE MUSIC HE HAS IN STAR WARS BEFORE THE IMPERIAL MARCH WAS A THING

I WANNA HEAR BOTH I GUESS I JUST WANNA HEAR A TIP OF THE CAP MUSICAL TO THE ORIGINAL DARTH VADER

IT COULD BE THEMATICALLY FITTING GIVEN THIS FILMS RELATIONSHIP TO A NEW HOPE
I JUST HOPE THE MUSIC WORKS

AND I HOPE THEY DON'T DO AS MANY FAN SERVICE MOMENTS AS IN FFA

I THINK IT WORKED FINE IN FFA BUT THE TONE OF THIS FILM JUST LOOKS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM REGULAR STAR WARS
I FEEL LIKE THE DEATH STAR SERVED AS A DECENT THROUGH LINE BETWEEN THE PREQUEL AND THE OT SEEING IT ALL THE WAY BACK IN EPISODE 2 AS A SEPARATIST PIPE DREAM THAT WAS LATER BY THE EMPIRE BROUGHT SOME GRAVITY TO THE CLONE WARS EVEN IF IT WAS IN THE BACKGROUND IT'S LIKE HITLER FINDING THE PLANS FOR A SUPER WEAPON AND DEPLOYING IT IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR THERE'S A COOL HISTORY THERE THAT'S NEVER BEEN EXPLORED I REALLY HOPE THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEATH STAR'S GEONOSIAN ROOTS
REALLY REALLY HOPE THEY DON'T HAVE VADER KILL EVERYONE THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE RUTHLESSNESS WITHOUT IT AND IT CHEAPENS THE DEATHS IN MY OPINION ALL VADER GOING MURDER MODE DOES IS GIVE FAN SERVICE AND JUST FEELS TACKY AS HELL
FINAL HOPES FOR ROUGE ONE

ROUGE BANNED

WHAT ARE YOUR FINAL HOPES FOR ROUGE ONE

DOUBLE ROUGE BANNED
VERY COOL
WANT IT IN MY LIVING ROOM
I AGREE THAT LUKE DIDN'T REALLY HELP THEM ESCAPE BUT WASN'T CRITICAL FOR THEM TO GET TO THE FALCON
I MORE OR LESS AGREE HAD LUKE NOT LEFT DEGOBAH HAN WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN FROZEN AND TAKEN TO ABBA AND LEIA CHEWBACCA LANDO AND THE DROIDS STILL WOULD HAVE PROBABLY ESCAPED ON THE FALCON THE ONLY MAJOR THING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED IS LUKE WOULD STILL HAVE HIS RIGHT HAND AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE LEARNED THAT ANAKIN AND VADER WERE THE SAME PERSON FROM VADER HIMSELF IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YODA AND WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM EVENTUALLY ALTHOUGH I DOUBT IT SINCE THEY WERE SO BIG ON KEEPING SECRETS OR HE WOULD HAVE LEARNED IT FROM VADER WHEN HE TRIED TO CONFRONT HIM FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS FIGHT WITH VADER IN RETURN OF THE JEDI COULD HAVE TUNED OUT DIFFERENTLY HAD HE NOT KNOWN VADER WAS HIS FATHER THEIR FAMILIAL CONNECTION WAS A BIG FACTOR IN BRINGING ANAKIN BACK FROM THE DARK SIDE SO HAD LUKE NOT KNOWN IT'S POSSIBLE HE WOULD HAVE LOST THAT BATTLE OR DIED ON THE DEATH STAR WHEN IT BLEW UP
HERE'S A VIDEO ABOUT IT
AUDIENCES AROUND THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN DENIED THE GREATEST CHARACTER MOMENT EVER IN A BLOCKBUSTER FILM

AND THE FILM IN GENERAL WOULD HAVE HAD QUITE A WEAK ENDING
AN INTERESTING WHAT IF RESCUE WOULD LIKELY BE AT BEST DELAYED WITH MORE TRAINING LUKE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEFEAT VADER EASY ENOUGH I THINK HE'D LIKELY NEED TO TRAIN FOR YEARS TO BE ABLE TO MATCH PALATINE THOUGH THEN THERE'S THE QUESTION IF YODA TELLS HIM ABOUT HIS HERITAGE WITH VADER OR NOT IF HE WENT INTO THE WHOLE SCENARIO THINKING VADER PURE EVIL AND IRREDEEMABLE IT TURNS HIM INTO A JEDI WARRIOR RATHER THAN HIS APPARENT NEED TO AVOID FIGHTING TO AVOID THE TEMPTATION OF THE DARK SIDE I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT YODA WOULD TELL HIM ABOUT ANAKIN BUT IN A WAY THAT CLEARLY EMPHASIZES HIS BELIEF THAT VADER IS IRREDEEMABLE SO ASSUMING THE DEATH STROKE CAN OCCUR IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE VADER IS KILLED YODA LIKELY WOULD HAVE TAUGHT LUKE TO DEFEND AGAINST FORCE LIGHTNING SO WHEN HE GOES AGAINST PALATINE IT WOULD COME DOWN TO LIGHTSABERS ON THE SAME HAND I DON'T THINK FOR AN INSTANT PALATINE WOULD RELY WHOLLY ON HIS OWN ABILITIES HE'D HAVE A BACKUP PLAN THE ONLY REASON THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WAS CAUSE OF UNEXPECTED BETRAYAL IF THE THRONE ROOM FLOODS WITH IMPERIAL GUARDS I CAN'T THINK OF A SOLUTION FOR LUKE AT BEST IT SEEMS HE CAN HOLD OFF RETREAT UNTIL THE DEATH STAR IS DESTROYED AND TAKES BOTH OF THEM WITH IT ASSUMING THE BATTLE STILL PLAYS OUT THE SAME
IT'S NOT LIKE EVERY BIT OF THE PLANET IS RESIDENTIAL AREA EITHER I'M SURE A GOOD PORTION ARE BUSINESS STORAGE TRADE AND TRANSPORT CENTERS AND A LOT IS PROBABLY GOVERNMENT FACILITIES AND MILITARY RELATED AND I ASSUME THE REPUBLIC OWN MOST FLOORS DIRECTLY UNDER AND NEAR THEIR FACILITIES FOR SECURITY PURPOSES IT IS THE CAPITAL OF THE KNOWN GALAXY AFTER ALL

THEN THEY ALSO HAVE LARGE POWERPLANTS TO KEEP THE WHOLE PLANET WORKING AND I ASSUME THERE ARE AT LEAST SOME AREAS SET ASIDE FOR FLORA FAUNA AND WATER PROBABLY SOME LARGE GREENHOUSES AND HYDROPONICS CENTERS SET UP ALL OVER THE PLANET

AND SINCE IT IS THE GALACTIC HUB AND CAPITAL I WOULD GUESS THERE ARE A DECENT AMOUNT OF FAIRLY WEALTHY PEOPLE THAT PRIVATELY OWN LARGE CHUNKS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

THEN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT A LOT OF THOSE LAYERS ARE EITHER UNINHABITED OR ARE SPARSELY OCCUPIED DUE TO POLLUTION CRIME AND DISREPAIR AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S HOW IT WAS IN THE OLD EU
REALLY PUTS THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE INTO PERSPECTIVE DOESN'T IT

YES IT DOES NOW STOP RUINING STAR WARS WITH YOUR REASONABLE AND RATIONAL ARGUMENTS
FOAH NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND YOU MAKE AN EXCELLENT POINT I ASSUME IT WAS JUST A BIG NUMBER SAME AS THERE BEING A FEW MILLION CLONES FOR A GALACTIC SCALE CONFLICT SOUNDS IMPRESSIVE UNTIL YOU THINK ABOUT IT
IF YOU LIKE THIS KIND OF THING YOU SHOULD READ THE FOUNDATION SERIES BY ISAAC ASIMOV

THE CAPITAL PLANET GRANTOR WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR CORUSCANT
SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS HAVE NO SENSE OF SCALE
WAIT UNTIL YOU START THINKING ABOUT HOW EVERY PLANET THEY EVER GO TO MUST BE SIMILAR IN SIZE TO EARTH OTHERWISE THEY SHOULD BE EXPERIENCING GRAVITY DIFFERENCES

I PERSONALLY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF WITH SCI-FI FANTASY
MOST PEOPLE LIVE UNDERGROUND CORUSCANT IT HAS OVER FLOORS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE SHEER NUMBER OF PEOPLE PLANETWIDE PER FLOOR AS WELL
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT CORUSCANT HAS TONS AND TONS OF INDUSTRY ON ITS SURFACE FACTORIES SHIPYARDS LARGE AUTOMATED MACHINERY CRUCIAL FOR THE PLANET'S SURVIVAL SO TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT MIGHT MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF A LARGER POPULATION DUE TO LESS SURFACE AREA BEING POPULATED OR IT COULD JUST BE AN OVERSIGHT LIKE YOU POINTED OUT
THE TRILLION COULD BE REGISTERED RESIDENTS BUT CORUSCANT COULD HAVE TRILLIONS MORE IN TOURISTS PEOPLE ON BUSINESS TRIPS TRADERS SMUGGLERS FLIGHTS UNDOCUMENTED BEINGS ETC AND DON'T FORGET THE SHEER AMOUNT OF STORAGE SPACE NEEDED FOR ALL THE DROIDS SPEEDERS SPACESHIPS SPACEPORTS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY WHAT ABOUT ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO KEEP A PLACE LIKE THAT RUNNING ALSO RECREATIONAL SPACES PARKS MUSEUMS ETC CORUSCANT ALSO HAS GIANT PLAZAS AND MONUMENTS ALL OVER AS WELL CORUSCANT IS ALSO HOME TO A LOT OF WEALTHY BEINGS WHO PROBABLY OWN AN OBSCENE AMOUNT OF REAL ESTATE LASTLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE ABANDONED INDUSTRIAL AREAS ARE UNINHABITABLE DUE TO TOXIC WASTE

AT LEAST IT'S BETTER THAN GRANTOR WHICH HAD A POPULATION OF LESS THAN BILLION GRANTOR AT ITS HEIGHT WAS APPARENTLY AN ENORMOUS GHOST TOWN
I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT LARGE AREAS OF CORUSCANT ARE INDUSTRIAL OR OTHERWISE NON-RESIDENTIAL

AND ALSO MANY OF THE LOWER LEVELS ARE ACTUALLY UNINHABITABLE

THAT SAID I STILL THINK THE POPULATION OF CORUSCANT SHOULD BE A BIT HIGHER
AHH BUT IS IT A US TRILLION OR A UK TRILLION TOTALLY DIFFERENT SCALES
WEST END HAS PER SQ MI YOU COULD LIVE PRETTY EASILY IN THAT DENSITY WITH THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY
I THINK YOUR MATH IS ALL WRONG YOU SAY THAT TO HAVE A POPULATION OF TRILLION CORUSCANT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A POPULATION DENSITY OF PEOPLE PER SQ MILE OKAY BUT THEN YOU SAY THAT IF EARTH HAD A PLANETWIDE DENSITY IDENTICAL TO MANHATTAN WE'D HAVE POPULATION THEN YOU GET EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS WITH THE KOWLOON CITY RATIO SO WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY EXACTLY THAT CORUSCANT ISN'T VIABLE WITH TRILLION PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S NOT UNLIVABLE ENOUGH
I'M PRECENT SURE GEORGE LUCAS NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS HE SIMPLY THOUGHT THE IDEA OF A PLANET SIZED CITY WAS COOL SO HE PUT IT IN THE MOVIE WHEN YOU REALLY START THINKING ABOUT THINGS IN THE SW UNIVERSE THEY MOSTLY MAKE ZERO SENSE
THEY WHERE SO PREOCCUPIED WITH WETHER OR NOT THEY COULD THEY DIDN'T STOP TO THINK IF THEY SHOULD
IT'S A GETAWAY VEHICLE DUH
REMINDS ME OF THIS

SETS
IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE SHIPS IN STAR FOX BOSS BATTLES THAT HAVE ALL THEIR GUNS FACING BACKWARDS SO THEY CAN SHOOT AT YOU WHILE YOU'RE CHASING THEM
I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BOTTOM WING AND WHAT IT'S TRYING TO DO
WHERE WAS THIS DISPLAY I'M APPALLED
HOW IS THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS RACIST

EDIT AVM SAND PEOPLE
MY FAVORITE WAS HOW PEOPLE CALLED IT TOO FAST PACED NOW A NEW HOPE IS SLOW PACED COMPARED TO FFA WHICH WAS WAY TOO FAST PACED

I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO STAR WARS IF ROTTENTOMATOES EXISTED BACK THEN WHAT PERCENT WOULD IT GET WOULD PEOPLE GO SEE IT AFTER SEEING THE REVIEWS COMBINED TOGETHER THAT WAS AN AGE WHERE MOST PEOPLE HADN'T EVEN READ A REVIEW EXCEPT MAYBE IN A NEWSPAPER
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL QUOTE SEEMS PRETTY SPOT ON FOR THE CURRENT MOVIE CLIMATE TSH
IF THE EMPIRE HAS THIS KIND OF POWER WHAT CHANCE DO WE HAVE

AYN THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHOICE

GARETH SAID THROUGH THEIR JOURNEY WE SEE THE FORMATION OF THE REBEL ALLIANCE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS WITNESSING THE FORGING OF AN ALLIANCE FROM A SET OF DISCORDANT VOICES SHOULD BE COOL
THAT SHOT THO
I AM SO STOKED FOR THE SEQUENCES EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN SO FAR LOOKS AMAZING
THE VISUALS LOOK INCREDIBLE I'M AFRAID IT WILL MAKE A NEW HOPE LOOK VERY DATED IN COMPARISON
JUST TO REMIND YOU ROGUE ONE IS NOT SHOT IN 3D THE 3D VERSION ONLY USES SOME 3D AFTER EFFECTS TO TAKE CASH AWAY FROM IDIOTS
THE MUSIC MAN SO GOOD
THIS LOOKS SO COOL CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE STAR WARS WAR FILM
MEMBER THA DEATH STAR

BOOM BABY MIDDLE SEATS OF THE MID ROW FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS ON THE OF DECEMBER AT IN THE MORNING IN THE NETHERLANDS

HOUR AND MINUTES LATE AND EDINBURGH STILL ISN'T SHOWING UP AS ONE OF THE AVAILABLE CINEMAS
OKAY BEEN CONFUSING ME BY THURSDAYDEC DO THEY MEAN LIKE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THURSDAY MORNING RIGHT
I GOT MINE FROM CINEWORLD ONLY AFTER 2 HOURS OF WAITING FOR THEM TO GO UP
GOT MY TICKETS FOR THE FBI IMAX IN WATERLOO WITH SLIGHT ANNOYANCE BUT IT'S FINE
ODEON FOR MIDNIGHT WAS RIDICULOUS TRYING TO GET TICKETS WAS A WORST EXPERIENCE THAN MY LAST BREAK UP
YUP JUST GOT MINE FOR THE MIDNIGHT SCREENING
CINE WORLD FOR ME BUT THAT STAR WARS GIVEAWAY THING WANTS A NUMBER BOOKING REFERENCE WHEN THE CODE IS ONLY
TRIED TO BOOK AT MIDNIGHT MY LOCAL CINEMA WASN'T SHOWING FOR SOME REASON TRIED IT AGAIN AT THIS MORNING AND MANAGED TO GET THE BEST SEATS GOING TO THE MIDNIGHT SCREENING CAN'T WAIT
GOING TO THE FIRST VIEWING IN LUTON THAT IS
FROM WHAT I CAN RECALL NOT REALLY THERE AREN'T ANY CANON NOVELS ABOUT AND MUCH OF THE LEGENDS STUFF THAT FEATURES HIM HEAVILY WAS AIMED AT YOUNGER READERS THERE WAS A SERIES OF YOUNG READER NOVELS CALLED JEDI APPRENTICE FOCUSED ON AND BEFORE EPISODE I HAPPENS I REMEMBER ENJOYING THEM AS A KID BUT I HAVE MY DOUBTS ON HOW WELL THEY WOULD HOLD UP
NOT YET BUT THAT SOUNDS PRETTY INTERESTING
NOTHING IN THE CANON YET

IN LEGENDS CHECK OUT THE JEDI APPRENTICE SERIES YOUNG READER BOOKS AND CLOAK OF DECEPTION
IT WOULD BE COOL TO SEE A MOVIE ABOUT THE EARLY JEDI AT THE FIRST TEMPLE IT COULD TIE IN NICELY WITH WHAT LUKE AND REY DO IN VIII
I'D RATHER THEY FOCUS ON NEW STUFF AND ALLOW BOOKS COMICS TO FILL IN THE CANON AS INTENDED
I'M NOT SURE HOW INTERESTED GENERAL AUDIENCES WOULD BE IN A MOVIE SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE CURRENT THREE TRILOGIES GRANTED THEY CAN DO A MILLION AND ONE THINGS THAT COULD ABSOLUTELY WORK AND BE GREAT BUT I'M PERSONALLY NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN SEEING THIS I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE STUFF POST RETURN OF THE JEDI
I REALLY LIKE THE ORIGIN OF THE JEDI THE WAY THE OLD REPUBLIC TELLS IT WITH PYTHON AND THE SPLINTERED GROUP OF JEDI GOING TO KORRIGAN

TALKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO THAT TIME PERIOD ALWAYS BOTH SUPER EXCITES ME AND TERRIFIES ME THRILLED AT THE CHANCE TO SEE MY FAVORITE PART OF THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE SCARED SHIFTLESS MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT IT WILL BE THROWN AWAY
WELL I DON'T THINK THEY'RE CARDBOARD I THINK THAT'S A LAYER OVERTOP OF THE SCENE ADDED IN POST PRODUCTION PART OF THE MATTE PAINTING
IF THAT'S THE EDITION DON'T FORGET THAT THE VERY WASHED OUT

IT LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER STILL NOTICEABLE IF YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THEM RATHER THAN THE CHARACTERS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WITH A PROPER GRADE DONE TO IT

EDIT IN FACT IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW IT SHOULD BE GRADED AND BY EXTENSION HOW IT BLENDS IN BETTER HERE'S MIKE ATTEMPT AT IT
THAT'S BEEN REPLACED IN INFANTICIDAL REMASTERINGS OF THE ORIGINALS

THAT BEING SAID THIS CHANGE MADE SENSE AS IT DOESN'T LOOK UP TO SNUFF WHEN IN SUCH HIGH DEFINITION
I THINK EXPLANATION IS MORE LIKELY IT'S PROBABLY A MATTE PAINTING
YOU'RE AN INTERN POSTING INFO THAT IS CLEARLY BARRED BY YOUR NDA FROM YOUR PERSONAL ACCOUNT YOU'RE EITHER REALLY FAKE OR REALLY DUMB
R STARWARSLEAKS WOULD APPRECIATE THIS I THINK DON'T FORGET TO ADD THE SPOILER FLAIR
I MEAN DO YOU HAVE A SOURCE FOR THIS OR IS IT ALL YOUR OWN SPECULATION

BECAUSE SOME OF IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE
WHAT THE HELL GET THIS SHIT OFF THIS SUB
YOUR FIFTH BULLET POINT OUTS YOU AS FULL OF IT BY ANYONE WHO HAS READ CATALYST TRYING DOING SOME MORE RESEARCH IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE YOU
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE FINAL CINEMA CUT WILL BE DIFFERENT AS SOME SCENES WERE NOT FULLY RENDERED YET
BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW FROM CATALYST I'M NOT SURE I BUY SOME OF THIS DIALOGUE
A LOT OF THE ICONIC REBEL SHIPS ACTUALLY ARE THE KIND OF SHIPS FLOWN BY PRIVATE CITIZENS IN THE GALAXY THEY'RE GUERILLAS AND HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN PARTICULAR THE CORALLIAN ENGINEERING CORPORATION IS THE BIGGEST MANUFACTURER OF STARSHIP IN THE GALAXY AND THE MILLENNIUM FALCON TACTIVE IV OUTRIDER AND GHOST WERE ALL BUILT BY THEM
WELL DIFFERENT SHIPS SERVED DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS

WEALTHY CITIZENS MIGHT HAVE A YACHT MUCH LIKE LADY LUCK

SOROSUUB WAS A COMMON CIVILIAN SHIP MANUFACTURER AS WAS CORALLIAN ENGINEERING CORPORATION

MANY FREIGHTER CAPTAINS HAD THE YT LINE OF SHIPS THAT DASH REIDAR AND HAN SOLO CAPTAINED
ALL SORTS HOWEVER MOST OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT IT COMES FROM LEGENDS PEOPLE USE SMALLER ONE MAN STARSHIP THROUGH FREIGHTERS AND FRIGATES RIGHT UP TO CRUISERS THE YT WAS USED AS A CIVILIAN SHIP TRANSPORTING CARGO BY THE AZZAMEENS BEFORE THEY JOINED THE REBELLION LANDO HAD A YACHT TYPE SHIP CIRC IN FACT MOST REBEL SHIPS BY AND LARGE ARE CIVILIAN SHIPS RETROFITTED WITH MILITARY WEAPONRY SHIELDING YOU CAN SEE A FEW CIVILIAN SHIPS IN THE SPECIAL EDITION OF ANH THE PREQUEL HAVE CIVILIAN SHIPS SEEN THROUGHOUT THE CORUSCANT SCENES SHIP MODELS LIKE THE EBON HAWK OR THE OUTRIDER ARE TYPES OF FREIGHTERS USED COMMERCIALLY BY CIVILIANS SLAVE I IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE JUST YEAH A WIDE VARIETY MOST OF WHAT ISN'T REPUBLIC EMPIRE ARE BASICALLY CIVILIAN SHIPS WITH THE REBELS CIS TYPICALLY RETROFITTING THEM FOR WAR
YEAH THE CROSSOVER BETWEEN THE TWO IS MINIMAL THERE ARE ONLY A FEW CHARACTERS THAT MAKE THE JUMP
IT IS BUT YOU WON'T FEEL MAN EMOTIONS FOR THE THE CHARACTERS FROM ACW SINCE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE
SEASON ONE WORKS FINE WITHOUT KNOWING CLONE WARS DETAILS 2 AND INCORPORATE MORE AND MORE HOWEVER
I MEAN YOU DON'T NEED TO BUT MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS IN THE SHOW ARE THE ONES FROM CLONE WARS AND WHILE THE SHOW EXPLAINS WHO THEY ARE YOU WON'T HAVE THE SAME ATTACHMENT TO THEM YOU WOULD OTHERWISE

I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FILLER STUFF IN CLONE WARS DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE STYLE BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BOTHER WATCHING THE CARTOONS ANYWAY YOU MIGHT AS WELL START OFF WITH CLONE WARS
SURE YOU COULD BUT CERTAIN ELEMENTS MAY LOSE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE WITHOUT HAVING BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THEM IN THE CLONE WARS I SUGGEST WATCHING ACW FIRST JUST SO YOU CAN FULLY APPRECIATE REBELS
ALWAYS BUT THERE IS SOME CHARACTER CROSSOVER THAT CONTINUES STORYLINES FROM CLONE WARS
IT'S ENTIRELY STAND ALONE

THE SHOW INTERNALLY COVERS ALL THE BACKGROUND STORY POINTS IT NEEDS TO WORK
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WATCH CW TO GET INTO REBELS I DO RECOMMEND CHECKING OUT A FEW OF THE MORE POPULAR CW ARCS THAT PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT ON HERE THOUGH
THAT WOULD BE LIKE WATCHING PREQUEL OVER THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY I LOVE THEM BOTH BUT ACW IS BETTER THAN REBELS MY SUGGESTION IS TO WATCH ACW TOO BECAUSE IT'S JUST AMAZING
YEAH YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE COMPRESSOR BUZ ITS STRAINING THE HYPERDRIVE
PROBABLY A BAD MOTIVATOR
CHECK HIS ANTENNA ISN'T BENT
MAKE SURE THAT THE UNIT INSIDE IS THE BASE POWERED ON THERE'S A SWITCH THERE YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT
CONTACT THEM
AMAZING
THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY SPHERE BB AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF PURCHASE
I REMEMBER HIM TALKING ABOUT THIS ON INSEA IT WAS A PLAN ALL ALONG APPARENTLY AND THEN HE HAD JAVAS COME ON AND FIX IT
DAMN DROID PROBABLY HAD A BAD MOTIVATOR
HE MENTIONED THIS ON THE PODCAST APPARENTLY HE WANTED TO HAVE MARK HAMILL COME OUT AND COMPLAIN ABOUT ITS MOTIVATOR
SHE'S THE PRETTIEST WOMAN I'VE SEEN IN A STAR WARS THEMED WEDDING GOOD FOR HIM

CHRIS HARDWICK IS ONE OF THE ONLY TWO CELEBRITIES I'VE MET IN MY LIFE HE CAME TO MY SCHOOL FOR STAND-UP AND I WAS WORKING IT I GOT TO TALK WITH HIM FOR A WHILE AND YOU CAN TELL HE IS JUST A GENUINELY GOOD PERSON
I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY HAS GOT AS THEIR FAVORITE DROID IT'S A REALLY FUN STORY AND SUPER COOL IDEA THOUGH
CHRIS HARDWICK HAS REPLACED RINGO STARR AS THE LUCKIEST HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET
FUN FACT DIDN'T BREAK DOWN TAMPERED WITH HIS BRAINS WHILE HE WAS ASLEEP AND CAUSED HIS FRONTAL LOBE TO EXPLODE

THERE'S ALSO AN OLD STORY THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE ONLY FORCE SENSITIVE DROID AND HAVING A VISION IN THE FORCE THAT WOULD HELP FULFILL LUKES DESTINY HE TAMPERED WITH HIS OWN BRAINS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THE FAMILY TOOK INSTEAD OF HIMSELF

I MUCH PREFER THE FIRST STORY WHERE IS BASICALLY HANNIBAL LECTOR
UNCLE OWENIAN

MAYBE HE WAS SECRETLY A JEDI DROID WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE AS A WAY OF SAYING DON'T DO IT BRO
CHRIS HARDWICK JUST SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE COOLEST GEEKY PEOPLE IN EXISTENCE I LOVE THE NEEDIEST PODCAST SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF HOW GREAT HE GETS ALONG WITH LITERALLY EVERYONE
MF DIDN'T EVEN SHAVE FOR HIS WEDDING
I KNOW THIS DROID HAS AN ACTUALLY REALLY ELABORATE BACKSTORY AND IS WAS I SUPPOSE BC IT'S DECANONIZE THE ONLY DROID JEDI AND BLOWING UP AT TIME WAS PART OF THE FORCE LETTING GET CHOSEN INSTEAD
HOW HARD DID JIMMY LAUGH AT THAT ONE
DOES THIS GUY HAVE A TWIN BROTHER HE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE MY AI TEACHER LIKE IT'S FUCKING UNCANNY
I WOULD HAVE FILMED HIS WEDDING FOR FREE I WANT TO FILM A BIG GEEK WEDDING SO DAMN BAD AND CHRIS WOULD HAVE DONE IT RIGHT
I THOUGHT IT WAS AN UNIT LUKE SAYS IT HIMSELF
THIS STORY SPONSORED BY FINITY
THATS SO AWESOME LOVE THAT GUY

SO HAS THERE EVER BEEN A CANON EXPLANATION ABOUT IS IT JUST COINCIDENCE THAT HE BROKE DOWN OR DID SABOTAGE HIM

OR OF COURSE YA KNOW HE'S A JEDI DROID
SOUNDS LIKE AN AWESOME WEDDING
GOD I HATE CHRIS HARDWICK
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO HE IS BUT HIS WIFE IS HOT
I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST LOCK THOSE TWO UP IN A ROOM AND CAUSE THEM TO BE STUCK IN AN INFINITE LOOP OF AT EACH TERRIBLE JOKES
IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE BUT MAN I CANNOT STAND THIS GUY
WOW WHAT A NERD HE'S JUST LIKE REGULAR PEOPLE
WHOA CHRIS HARDWICK GOT MARRIED I THOUGHT HE WAS STILL ROLLING SINGLE AFTER CHLOE

I DONT KNOW WHY I GOT DOWNVOTED I WAS HONESTLY SURPRISED AND HAPPY FOR HIM
I ALWAYS ASSUMED HE WAS GAY TIL
HER FACE LOOKS LIKE I'VE MADE A HUUUGE MISTAKE
IF MEMORY SERVES WE ONLY SAW THAT SCENE WITH THE ROYAL GUARDS ONCE AND THAT WAS IN AN EARLY IF NOT THE FIRST TRAILER FOR THIS MOVIE IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE FINAL CUT I'D LOVE TO SEE THE EMPEROR BUT I DON'T THINK WE WILL AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE DOING IT WHEN MCDIARMID IS STILL AROUND AND ABLE TO DO IT
NUMBER IF HE'S NOT IN IT HE'S NOT IN IT I JUST WANT THE FILM TO BE GOOD
IF MY MEMORY IS CORRECT THEY ALREADY SAID PALATINE WON'T BE HAVING A MAJOR ROLE IF HE APPEARS AT ALL

THAT SAID I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM BUT I HAVE MY DOUBTS
HELL I'D LOVE A VOICE ONLY APPEARANCE WITH VADER ILLUMINATED BY THE BLUE GLOW OF HIS HOLOGRAM
I HOPE NOT I FEEL LIKE HIS APPEARANCE WOULD BE TOO MUCH THE MOVIE IS ABOUT ORIGINAL CHARACTERS IT'S ALMOST BAD THAT VADER IS THERE HIS PRESENCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BLOT OUT FOCUS ON THE NEW CHARACTERS
ALTHOUGH I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM I'M NOT EXPECTING TO SEE HIM IN IT I'D BE CURIOUS TO SEE THE RUMORED CGI LARKIN FROM A WHILE BACK THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO BE REALLY WELL DONE OR SOMETHING BUT I'M NOT EXPECTING TO SEE THAT EITHER
GLAD HE'S GETTING SOME RECOGNITION HIS STUFF IS GREAT
GUY IS TALENTED ALWAYS ENJOY HIS STUFF
ONE OF OUR FAVORITE ARTISTS OR ONE OF YOUR MOST COMMON VICTIMS OF KARMAWHORING
SAD YOUR DAD COULDN'T BE HERE
I GOT YOU A NEW WRENCH MATT
MATT THE RADAR TECHNICIAN FAFFY
A BUDDY OF MINE SAID HE SAW HIM TAKE HIS SHIRT OFF IN THE SHOWER HE SAID HE HAD AND ACK THAT HE WAS SHREDDED
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ADAM AND HIS ACK
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MATT
LOOK HOW OLD YOU'VE BECOME
SORRY YOUR DAD COULDN'T BE HERE THIS YEAR KALO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY AFTER THE RAIN COMES THE RAINBOW
I WONDER HOW MANY DARR VADER THEMED CARDS HE'S GOING TO GET LOL
WHOA NO IDEA I SHARED A BIRTHDAY WITH HIM THAT'S AWESOME
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DUDE TO THE BEST CHARACTER AND ONE OF THE BEST ACTORS IN THE SAGA HAVE A GOOD ONE
THAT LOOKS LIKE MATT
HAPPY BIRTHDAY KALO
HEY YOU KICKED MY WRENCH
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT PART IN ARMY OF DARKNESS WHEN ASH WAS TRYING TO RECITE THE PASSAGE AT THE ALTER
IT'S MY SON'S BIRTHDAY TOO HIS FIRST
I HEARD HE HAS AN EIGHT PACK
BURN IN HELL MOTHERFUCKER YOUR CHARACTER KILLED MY FAVORITE CHARACTER OF FORTY YEARS LONGER THAN YOU'VE BEEN ALIVE

WHICH IS TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY
I WONDER HOW HE FEELS ABOUT SAND
UGLIEST MAN IN STAR WARS
I STILL DON'T GET HOW HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE SON OF HARRISON FORD AND CARRIE FISHER HE HAS NONE OF FEATURES
AH THE GREAT JAR JAR BANKS HE WAS GREAT IN THAT PART
HOPE YOU GROW INTO THOSE EARS CHEERS
FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE DECIDING TO KEEP THE SEQUEL RIGHTS MERCHANDISING TO STAR WARS FOR HIMSELF

FROM A CREATIVE PERSPECTIVE DECIDING TO TURN VADER INTO POPPA WHILE WRITING EMPIRE
FOR ME IT WAS TRYING SOMETHING UTTERLY NEW HE DID THAT WITH THE OT AND THE PART THE PT WAS FAR FROM FLAWLESS BUT GETTING TO SEE WHAT THE WORLD WAS LIKE BEFORE THE EMPIRE WAS GREAT IT WAS SO FLESHED OUT AND DETAILED
TO WRITE STAR WARS PERIOD IF HE HADN'T MADE THAT CHOICE NOTHING ELSE WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
NOT HATING ON LUCAS I LOVE THE DUDE BUT SELLING TO DISNEY TO MY KNOWLEDGE HE WAS FIDDLING WITH A SEQUEL TRILOGY BUT NO BIG MOVES WERE MADE

WITH NEW PEOPLE IN CHARGE WE ARE SEEMINGLY GETTING AWESOME STAR WARS MOVIES EVERY YEAR FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AS WELL AS A GREAT CARTOON AND TONS OF FANTASTIC COMIC BOOKS FROM MARVEL

STAR WARS IS BIGGER THAN EVER RIGHT NOW

WITHIN THE MOVIES HE WAS INVOLVED WITH CREATING STAR WARS AS A WHOLE WITHOUT THE GUY WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY OF THIS STUFF WE ALL LOVE HE'S A CERTIFIED GENIUS IF YOU ASK ME
HE STUDIED ANTHROPOLOGY AND FOLKLORE HE READ JOSEPH CAMPBELL AND ETHNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL GEORGE LUCAS BEST DECISION WAS ALLOWING HIS CURIOSITY TO SWERVE INTO A MULTIDISCIPLINARY GROOVE HE COULD BUILD UNIVERSES FROM THE GROUND UP BECAUSE HE STUDIED CULTURE FROM THE GROUND UP
SELLING TO DISNEY HE MADE A FUCK TON OF MONEY AND GAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF IT TO CHARITY
LIGHTSABERS
I SHOULD MAKE A NEW VERSION OF THE FLASH GORDON MOVIES
I FEEL LIKE IT'S A BIT OF A COP-OUT TO SAY HIS DECISION TO MAKE STAR WARS WAS HIS BEST DECISION BUT GETTING THAT OUT OF THE WAY

I GUESS I'D SAY HIS EARLY CHOICES IN COLLABORATORS IN MY MIND THERE'S THREE GUYS THAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE GODFATHERS OF STAR WARS GEORGE LUCAS RALPH MCQUARRIE AND JOHN WILLIAMS TAKE AWAY ONE AND STAR WARS IS FUNDAMENTALLY A DIFFERENT MOVIE OBVIOUSLY GEORGE IS ON A BIT OF HIGHER TIER SINCE HE'S THE ORIGINATOR OF THE IDEA BUT WILLIAMS AND MCQUARRIE HELP DEFINE THE AUDIO AND VISUAL TONES OF STAR WARS ABILITY TO FIND THESE GUYS AND THEN INSPIRE THEM TO CREATE THESE MASTERPIECES IS SO IMPORTANT

AND YES I KNOW THERE'S TONS OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAD HUGE INFLUENCES ON STAR WARS FROM BEN BURTT JOE JOHNSON JOHN DYKSTRA NORMAN REYNOLDS GARY KURTZ MARCIA LUCAS ETC ON DOWN BUT I REALLY FEEL LIKE THOSE THREE ARE THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS
I WONDER IF THE THE PREQUEL TRILOGY WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF DARTH BUAL HADN'T BEEN KILLED OFF BUT I GUESS IT'S KINDA OF THE OPPOSITE OF THE OT WITH DARTH VADER NOT BEING KILLED OFFICIAL
SELLING THE FRANCHISE
WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS THE BEST DECISION GL MADE WHILE IN CONTROL OF STAR WARS

CHANGING IT SO GREED SHOT FIRST

HAN CAN'T BE A COLD BLOODED MURDERER

EDIT IS THIS AN UNPOPULAR OPINION

EDIT 2 TO THE DOWNVOTERS
ASW THAT'S ADORABLE IT'S QUITE AMAZING HOW MOVIES MADE ABOUT YEARS AGO CAN STILL HAVE SUCH AN IMPACT ON A YOUNG CHILD MAY THE FORCE BE WITH HER
SO CUTE LYYYYT
WAIT TICKETS WENT ON SALE NOBODY TOLD ME
PLACED TOO MUCH FAITH IN TECHNOLOGY YOU DID
REALLY SUCKS

I FOUND OUT BY CHANCE BUT HAVE CONTACTED ODEON AS I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY EMAIL ALERTS I'D ADVISE YOU TO CONTACT THEM TOO MAYBE THEY'LL PUT ON AN EXTRA SHOWING BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BUMMER THE EMAILS COULD HAVE BEEN SENT AT YESTERDAY WHEN THEIR FACEBOOK POST WENT UP
SUCKS TO BE YOU DUDE
I'LL ADMIT I KINDA LIKE THOSE BLASTERS
ON ALI EXPRESS THERE IS A STAR WARS FIGURE THAT HAS A DOUBLE SIDED BLASTER STAFFORDSHIRE LIKE A DOUBLE SIDED LIGHT SABER BUT INSTEAD OF SABER BLADES ITS BLASTERS

ANY WAY IM GOING TO BUY THE LAPIN STAR WARS EXECUTER CLASS SUPER STAR DESTROYER BECAUSE THAT SHIT IS BADASS AND ONLY LIKE
R CRAPPYSTARWARS
