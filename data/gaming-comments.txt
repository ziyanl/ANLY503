I'm more interested in the "Flaming Paddle Ball".
The .44 Pistol is actually based on the Smith & Wesson Model 29, not a Colt design...

Just buying a digital download saves the most plastic!
Why is the US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches? That’s an exceedingly odd number.

Why was that gauge used?

Because that’s the way they built them in England, and English expatriates built the US Railroads.

Why did the English build them like that?

Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that’s the gauge they used.

Why did “they” use that gauge then?

Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing.

Okay! Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing?

Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that’s the spacing of the wheel ruts.

So who built those old rutted roads?

Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe (and England) for their legions. The roads have been used ever since.

And the rut they the roads?

Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were made for Imperial Rome, theywere all alike in the matter of wheel spacing.

The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches is derived from the original specifications for an Imperial Roman war chariot. And bureaucracies live forever. So the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse’s ass came up with it, you may be exactly right, because the Imperial Roman war chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the back ends of two
war horses.
Just bought the patent on square box extenders to help your new cases fit into your current DVD/CD racks.
Except that is an Xbox 360 case...  Xb1 and PS4 are already smaller to follow bluray. 
Nah. I like the full size cases. Gives room for those who chose to still include a manual to do so and gives more room for interesting box art. 
Well actually they're smaller than DVD cases now.....
Also, we want 2 HDMI outputs so we can play 2 player games without splitscreen.
Of course the Switch will probably use cases the size of the DS and 3DS cases because cartridges.
Way to come with the snark like a whole console generation late... In case you haven't noticed Blu ray cases are already just barely larger than the disc, with just about a half inch of plastic above the sleeve for branding purposes, and Xbox One and PS4(actually starting with the PS3) have always used Blu Ray cases.
Like the Playstation 1 cases?
The smaller case reminds people of a CD and people don't buy CDs anymore.
Like Nintendo DS games?
Nintendo did something cool with their 3DS cases. There are small squares throughout that reduce the amount of plastic used to make the case. It allows them to keep their standard sized cases but still remove material.
Someone also needs to make smaller game racks.
As a plastics engineer, I like this idea. Less time making the part and more time to make more parts!
i wonder how much money nintendo spent while making cases for gamecube games
Or create a delivery mechanism that doesn't need physical copies at all.  Game cases are so 1990s.
If only you could get games w/o needing to produce physical media at all... wouldn't that be grand?!
Even worse is when you get a physical case and it only has a cdkey.

http://i.imgur.com/fKGZq4D.jpg
But where are you supposed to store your PS2 memory cards then??
But I want some fish to wear my game case as a hat for the rest of their life. 
How about the first R and reduce plastic use altogether by going digital? 
Fuck that. Give me a ton of plastic and an actual booklet like we used to have. 
I remember some cases had a slot at the top for memory cards, kinda outdated now but that probably helped keep it standard.
Shelf Illuminati CONFIRMED
"BUT WE NEED MORE ROOM TO POST PRE-RENDERED IN-ENGINE SHOTS ON THE BACK COVER"

 Every AAA developer ever
I'd like slim jewel cases for my dvd / blue rays.  I certainly get more shelf rack space.
NYO. I DONT WANNA.

I WANNA TAKE A PART OF MY GAME AND SELL IT AS DLC INSTEAD.
Or just make them out of card...
In other words go back to PS 1/CD cases
I promise you it's done this way so they can fit "game of the year award"  shit, their logos, their other bullshit titles and awards they slap all over the front, and quotes from shitty unheard of editorials on there without compromising their pristine cover art. Dicks
Ps3 had smaller cases forever. Very few ps3 games came out in full sized cases. Ps4 carried on this tradition of course. 
Also has to do with the aspect ratio of the cover art, I believe. 
Much like album covers, I love PC game boxes and console cases. Major reason I only buy digital copies of games that are either too old to run on a modern system, or never released in a box. In that case I'm waiting until it's under $10.  

Sorry, Dev. Box was worth an extra 50.
Also transport fuel and space in shops and warehouses.
Or you could buy all games on steam/online 
It's already [like that](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia1.gameinformer.com%2Ffilestorage%2FCommunityServer.Components.SiteFiles%2Fimagefeed%2Ffeatured%2Fmicrosoft2013%2Fxbox-one%2FXboxOneCaseFlipDisc.jpg&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bianoti.com%2Fgallery-xbox-one-game-case-back.html&docid=KKHclhwnghZrBM&tbnid=oR9QKGPBOnKphM%3A&vet=1&w=610&h=458&client=ms-android-hms-tmobile-us&bih=518&biw=360&ved=0ahUKEwjxyZfu79DQAhXnqlQKHcBzAkgQMwhlKC8wLw&iact=mrc&uact=8)
It's called the Golden Ratio. For some reason, the ratio of height to depth is pleasing to the human eye. And its mathematical roots can be linked to the fibonacci sequence, which occurs all over the place in nature in the form of spirals.

It's not about functionality, just pleasing design.
Haha,  have you seen DS game cases?
I'm perfectly OK with current Bluray case sizes.  I need some flexibility in my media racks.
Or NONE OF THE PLASTIC! =D

Shelf space is an advertising medium. I doubt that'll change any time soon. At least not before more conversion to digital download.
This is completely of-topic from gaming but ever bought Gillette razor blades?

Those packages are just damned wasteful. They come in small plastic containers containing 4 of those blade heads. If it was just that, alright that's decent. 

Thing is you buy them per 16 whole package. And each package has 5 of the plastic containers. So you have 3 containing 4 and 2 more that each contain 2. Why?

Then the package containing the smaller containers is a piece of cardboard roughly the size of 2/3rd of a A4 paper surrounded by the kind of plastic you need a set of butcher knives and protective gloves to open.

Also really damn wasteful but they do that one to avoid people pocketing it, cause those things are expensive.

Which also partly why they don't make boxes for dvd's and such smaller. The smaller you make them the easier they are to steal.
You know whats even better? A digital copy.
Alternatively... buy everything digitally. Then you're saving even more space, paper, ink and plastic.

And yes, I know digital tends to be more expensive. It doesn't bother me and the convenience is worth it
Or you can avoid ALL plastic and just go digital the way mobile and PC gamers have. Catch up, console gamers! We're in the 21st century!
we can't do this now, my neat shelf of game boxes will be ruined!
Was this comment made in 2004? Download your game. 
Meanwhile, I miss the shit out of big-box PC games.

Fuck trees.
That's some good adivce.
Like, I understand why DVD cases are the shape they are... Yea sure whatever.  BUT!!!

GAME CASES USED TO BE CD CASES!  Lets go back to that guys.  It'll be easier to ship if they are the size of a CD and there are 80 bajilion ways to store CDs... Lets fucking do this.  seriously.  I'd be so damn happy.
Actually it's so they can fit multiple discs in when needed without making the exterior of the case thicker. Think about what PS1 game cases looked like. Also just buy everything digitally and consume zero plastic if you give a shit. 
Someone misses this PS1...
Nobody show him a DS game case.
The original Playstation started out with plastic cases similar to what they have now.  Then they went to cardboard cases, then they went to regular CD/DVD jewel cases.  

So they have been there already.  I'm not sure why they went back. 
This isn't even close to a noteworthy amount of plastic lost. Other applications waste thousands of times more than this.
And stop sending me junk mail fuckos.
Redbox leans back and crosses arms with smug smile
I mean you also had like 30 page game manuals in the past that fit in those little tabs. But I feel like every physical game I've bought recently has resembled the one on the right, so I think they are switching. Set-up costs to make the new case might be higher but suppliers are already making them, so why not save on material costs.

But you do have to account for marketing and printing on the case, which become tougher with a smaller area. I think this whole point is relatively moot because we're moving toward digital anyway.
Because people pay money and a big even if mostly empty box makes people feel like they got their money worth.
Sony introduced the small cases for PS3 while MS kept using the big DVD cases. Now they are using the same sized cases as Sony for XB1. 
Actually, it's an outdated Western marketing mindset. I'm actually kind of surprised it's still being used. They do this because they believe it makes the consumer think they get more bang for their buck.

Some prior examples:

* The Japanese PC Engine was *tiny* - about three stacked CD jewel cases. When they brought it to the West in the form of the TurboGrafx-16, they more than doubled the size of the thing - simply so it wouldn't look so tiny, because tiny means weak.
* Atari Lynx. That thing was also much bigger than it needed to be. If you open one up, you'll see most of the shell is empty.
* 3DO, Sega CD and Sega Saturn game cases. They were regular jewel case-sized in Japan, but enlarged drastically when released in the West.
Actually I thought cases were shaped like that because of manuals. Manuals, you guys remember those? Ah, those were the days.

This is like waiting for humans to stop growing an appendix. These cases are a hold-over from a bygone era when things were much simpler and literacy was taken for granted. 
Uhh.. shelf presence? Verifiably increased sales from the extra visibility?
I know Nintendo is already on this with the WiiU cases, which have large chunks of plastic omitted. http://i.imgur.com/iQ6lxBi.jpg 
This comment will be lost but someone should make a change.org for this and actually see if we could get it changed
But then there is no room for my memory card. :(
why would they bother spending any money re-tooling their factories when that works fine though....
Ah, wanna go back to the old PlayStation days eh? It's a bold proposition, lets see how it plays out.  
It's also probably due to psychological factors involved in marketing. The old PS1 and original Xbox cases were the size and shape of the smaller disc box on the right. They needed to differentiate the box from the original consoles. 

This might have to do with the psychological perception that the old games weren't as big in terms of gameplay environments as the discs had a smaller memory capacity. Small case = less data = smaller game environment. Bigger case (even with same size disc) = perception of more data = more game space/time. 
Or the og disc shaped plastic case why do you need it in a square shape?
Yeah I mean, that doesn't even save that much plastic.  They should use that biodegradable plastic. 
Just think about all the people with fake ocd that will go online and cry like bitches because they changed the shape of the thing, whatever shall they do! Fuck the planet, i don't want to deal with those people.
As a collector of Japanese gamecube games I understand this. I love the smaller form factor.
In the US, PC game cases come in even fatter boxes for no reason.
Well will go all digital eventually
They already look like this for XboxOne. Am I missing something here?
I just got my titanfall 2 game for PC.  It was just a game code inside a full size case... I think a lot of people just like to have it on the wall for their collection, though I would have preferred just a code.  Why sell the physical copy for $28 and make the digital more expensive?

[Japanese Gamecube cases got it right](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/media/gen816.jpg)
cereal boxes as well. Its all about shelf adspace.
Currently, it's the golden ratio. More pleasing to the eye. It also looks better on bookshelves, in my opinion.
Well, BluRays and PS3/4 games are already gong for this [form factor](http://i985.photobucket.com/albums/ae339/Al724/Slipcovers/100_1840.jpg)
ALSO, those bigger boxes are less sturdy. 
But only thought is the bigger ones wont fit into a shoplifters pocket. 
My first job was at a shitty K-Mart :( 
That's how PS1 cases were until everyone complained about their odd size and they changed it to DVD standard with the PS2
I don't want my manual to be a square 
Steam. trash free. 
Or, you can get with the times and download. That uses even less plastic. 
PS4 games already there boii
Can accomplish the same thing by taking Nintendo's approach... keeping the same size, but "swiss-cheesing" the case itself.

/u/hitboxgamingUK hit the nail on the head, even though you don't like it... 
Bring back jewel cases
While we're at it, let's mention 3ds game cases, since the contain carts that are about a square inch, and have cases the size of roughly a CD. (This also applies to PSVita now that I think about it.)
Don't do anything besides digital distribution, if physical cases are required, make it more or less exactly like RedBox cases.
Or, you know, sell games as reusable, high-capacity memory cards rather than scratch-prone, save-incapable, unmodifiable, slow-loading physical media discs. You can sell those with packages the size of matchboxes.
The reason they're that size and CD packaging was so ridiculously large was to make it more difficult to shoplift. I have no idea if it actually helps.

Physical media is (should be) dead anyway.
Hey if you want to save the planet just go Vegan. Simple 
Yo that plastic will be used for something anyways. Rather it be used for my $60 video game rather than some bottles or something. When you pay good money for things its ok to have nice rectangles 
You want to reduce oil consumption?

Reduce plastic use.
This is actually a good idea.
To all you people saying go digital, more often than not for me digital is more expensive, particularly with newly released games. Also, a lot of people like to trade in their games when they're done with them. 
Or play PC and not have to worry about cases :)
And make the packaging tape on the side be a little less difficult to open please.
LMAO HE BUYS PHYSICAL GAMES IN 2015+1 !!!

Is it bad that I initially read the post title as "Battlefield and I..." without even second-guessing it. 
These are my initials, and everyone at work refers to me as my initials.

Needless to say, the title raised an eyebrow at first.
Read that as "Battlefield and I".

This is why you always should use the [Wadsworth Constant](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/kxfxy/and_so_ends_20_years_of_frustration/c2o1cyy).
[the shortest guides are the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DeBfvPiFN0)
Also I really enjoy your 30 seconds long dubstep intro where you name bounces up and down and does some sweet flips and shit. Good stuff.
Before that it was 'Unregistered Hypercam 2' in the corner and a notepad text instruction.
I just ask Reddit for help. 
Dont forget the part where they ask for likes
Oh it's so annoying. I wish there were more written tutorials like the good old days 
This is why I look for playthroughs instead of walkthroughs and just to be sure add in a 'no commentary'
Hit that mf subscribe.
And it goes on like that for what feels like an endless eternity. Bob Ross gave you an incredible vista landscape in that amount of wasted time.
It's even worse for things like Minecraft mods where there's no documentation, just a video with crappy audio of the author doing about 30% of the mod's content way too quickly without any explanation.

Coming a close second are secret guides which are just a recording of a playthrough of the level, how does that help me find what I'm missing? The best ones I've seen were some super-short ones for secrets in the new Doo~~m~~t, video starts with a quick pan around on the map screen, then a look around to help you orient where the shot is from, then he calmly hits the hidden button (or whatever) grabs the secret, job done.
I fucking love this post. Thank you. When they start to explain why they haven't posted in a while I get kind of ragey.
I make a thing in my videos of getting to the point specifically because of this !  

Worse thing is recently I didn't know how to do something , googled it and the first video was one I had made ....


"Hello, You-chube." Then proceeds to cough directly into the microphone.
Or the blaring 2003 quality speed metal with the Windows Movie Maker title card "xXxSHARKFIGHTER32xXx PRESENTS:..."
The only thing that annoys me more is when they type what the instructions are into notepad, but it takes them about 3 seconds to find each letter on the keyboard.
Cheatcc and Gamefaqs for life! 

Special thanks to:

Don't forget the 2 minute intro for a 5 minute vid. I just seek to where I recognise from the game and watch it from there.
or those shitty intros with the loud electronic music and the shitty banners of the name of the youtube channel
If you can't find the content you're looking for then maybe try make your own, there's clearly a space in the market.
Stuff and things. 
I don't really like the alternative either, though, where they just silently scroll through menus and maps until they arrive at the thing. I know it's supposed to be succinct, but it feels condescending. The few youtubers who've found that happy middle ground are my favorite.
It's worst with minecraft videos. 

Oh, you're trying to look up how mod A interacts with mod B?

I don't understand why it's so damn difficult anymore to put a text-and-picture walkthrough out. It's so much easier for me to scan through, find the relevant bit, and get back to gaming as opposed to waiting for the goddamn ad to finish, then buffer, then start, then buffer, then jump around the video until I get fed up with it and ragequit and go outside. Obligatory 'get off my lawn' and 'something something good ol' days'.
Rate my old [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvubRTo3KTs). Is this what you want?
Clearly fake. Any popular youtuber would have said the f word at least twice by that point.

For real though, it's sad but that's the kind of shit that brings in the views. Most of the people who watch these videos are like 13-17 years old and they're not smart enough to realize how annoying it is. ;/
YASSSSSSS
This game is super mature with dealing with real thing like death and poop.
Pokemon, gotta crash 'em all... *Cries*
Man, pokemon really got into the storytelling this time around. I like it. 
I'm not crying my eyes are using Surf
I was fully expecting a Hachiko type situation where the Machamp would stand by the owners grave till its death. Thank fuck I was wrong. 
Is it fucked that i expected her to be banging the machamp?
Serious question.

If a captured wild pokemon takes its pokeball and throws it in the sea, is that pokemon technically free forever? Would it ever be possible to recapture it?

What's stopping a diabolical pokemon from killing its owner and doing that?
I'm almost positive at one point early in the game before you go into a fight an NPC says something like "let's do this, My body is ready"...that's when i was sold on the writing for this game haha.
Pokemon seems really awesome this year, would anyone recommend it?
Think about that for a moment. The pokeball was made for a pokemon to live in the most comfortable atmosphere possible while inside. Basically, the Pokeball, is better than home can ever be, and that Machamp refuses to ever go back inside because it feels guilty it couldn't protect its owner.

THAT, is the real depression right there. The fact that a made up character on a screen has more storytelling than an entire movie franchise. And that shit made me cry....

I hope you live happy you giant champion


I DIDNT COME HERE TO FEEL DAMNIT
And the TM is Fling, because he threw the pokeball from the car before he died.
What type of accident was the husband involved in?
that would be fucked up if somewhere near here there was just a pokeball item laying around. you would have to assume that would be the ball that machamp just threw someplace. 
[Snorlaxes must be weak against Camrys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSEX2JbTrlk).
The writing in S&M has me actually reading stuff for once. I've played every gen and I habitually mash a on every text line. 

This moment I actually stopped and began reading was the marowak dance sequence. It was so funny I started reading what the guy was saying and have been reading it all since that point. So good.
Pokemon is weird because they have people saying stupid stuff like " I like wearing shorts", and serious stuff like this. They also have little kids fighting you and giving you money on top of all the sexual innuendos and jokes. It's a wacky world and I love it.
Are we sure this is still a kids game
hypno abducts children.


Trevenants are the amassed souls of children who died in forests.

Yamask are human ghosts who posses people with a mask made from their face.
I'm sure this will be the subject of a bad game theory/ creepy pasta
Pokemon can be really dark sometimes. People criticize it for what they hear lately, or what new Pokemon come out. Especially in Generation 6... They made fun of Team Flare for wanting to make the world beautiful. Little do they know they wanted to do that by purifying the world and killing everything on it.
When I look at the current Z-Ring and which target audience they try to reach, but add such deep stories, I'm confused. Is Pokémon for children or for grown ups. But yeah probably children will play it but don't get the deep meaning.
Yeah...almost like that one house on the first Island that has a lone dude in his house with a kids room that's been untouched forever. They tried to do it softly but yeah..dead kid. And in the front room is a bunch of bent and fucked up golf clubs that he obviously busted against a tree or wall out of grief for his dead child.
Man, am I the only one imaginnig the scenerio with the Machamp seeing the on-coming car, getting ready to attempt to stop it and sacrifice it's own life to possibly save its owner, only to get sent back to its pokeball?

Then sitting in the Pokeball coming to terms with the fact that its owner just died...  And there was nothing it could do.  sheesh.

Makes sense why it threw away the pokeball, probably blames it for why he was unable to protect its owner.
The writing in this game has been a huge step up 
The twist is that Machamp caused the crash so he wouldn't have to live in that stupid ball anymore
This game got pretty serious. I'm loving the story so far. 
I happened to be listening to some real sad music at the moment of reading this and it provided me with goosebumps haha.
the game may not be the best of the series (don't h8 i'm not that far into it) but the innuendo is spot on. also they brought back being able to dress up the girl, which pretty much sold it. 
Damn
Machamp is totally hitting it now.
I suddenly started crying at the part :( the feels.
isn't Pokémon my source of happiness? But I can't stop these goddamn FEELS :,,,[
I've been to 2 cemetery areas already and never saw this, where does it happen?
 I don't get it someone explain please
It seems like Sun and Moon are really upping the ante with this game. I hope the Switch turns out to be decent so I can buy it and play this. 
Pokemon have really changed since my childhood.
MACHAMP DID IT ALL
I saw this on Facebook like 3 days ago
Pokémon will lay it on you just when you least expect it, talking to that one lone NPC in the corner of a room you want to get out of ASAP.
Yes... an "accident."
Man there is some serious shit in this Pokemon, between the dialogue and the Pokedex entries lol
After not playing pokemon for years, I grabbed Y a few months ago and played through that.  
I was not expecting the old man you lend a pokemon to. Pokemon was supposed to be about adventures, not feels.  I teared up over it.
If only the gameplay assumed you were this mature. The new games might actually be difficult.
Are you kidding? If I were that woman, I'd make my Machamp beat that dude down to a pulp and made a pudding of whatever remained of him.
I think she wanted to get rid of her impotent husband and fuck with Machamp.
Can't a machop, let alone a machamp, lift huge boulders? Why didn't the husband just have Machamp stop the speeding car, and heal it up at a poke center later?
I wasn't expecting her to give me goddamn TM Fling.

"Well now you know he can't use this anymore, take this!"

*You've obtained TM Fling*
When you catch all the UBs, That story is pretty messed up how the one guy. Retired police guy from potown used that one person as bait
See when you skip through all the dialogue like me, you miss all this.
Also try the Eevee quests from the Supermarket cashier in the endgame if you want some more feels like this.
Ever read the letters in sea mauville in oras?  I don't remember the room they're in but there's like 7 letters and they almost made me cry how sad they were
I was genuinely taken back when this happened. Very heart wrenching, but also amazing.
I met that gal in the game last night, I was like "woah" thinking people weren't kidding about stuff the NPCs in this game say.  Wow.  I was hoping she was gonna give us Machamp Strength seeing how hers is carrying her. Not yet.
Holy feels Batman...
Jesus Christ, Nintendo/pokemon, I came to have fun not be bombarded by sad reality! (Lavender town music plays) *sighs*
Reads like a shitty reddit post..
Ya know. That's one hard bit for a kids video game, BUT it teaches kids a very important lesson: Always look at the other side of the coin. And it teaches that lesson in a powerful way.

We need more of this, even though it might feel uncomfortable in a game.
Oh look, would you look at the time, looks like it's Feels-thirty 
The feels on the bus go sad, sad, sad.
Wow meaningful dialogue from a Pokemon game! Gamefreak has really stepped up their game haha
I came here to laugh, not to feel :(
Legit made me cry. :( Like damn Pokémon... 

Then you meet that other Machamp in the resort that appears to be getting sexually harassed by two women...
What Pokémon game is this?
Is that only in Sun or did I just miss her in Moon? 

Coz I would happily board that feels train
This is too depressing. Luckily it's attached to the most macho Pokemon there is.
I came here to catch, not to feel.
yep. like many others, was enjoying my weekend, drinking a bit while playing...got to this bit and started sobbing uncontrollably....pretty sure my friend thinks I'm crazy now.
I had this scene today and I cried like a baby. at 25. Crying because of pokemon. 
I can't take this scene seriously when the big guy's just carrying her while talking about this...
So I'm going to guess you all did not play X or Y and found the old man or Looker then.
Pokemon drunk and s**t, trying to be Pokemon reborn and s**t
Getting cucked by your own pokemon, deep.
I bet she fucks that thing, sentimental moment ruined 👀
Obviously her husband caused the accident. What was Machamp doing outside of its ball and why her husband put him back in the ball at the last moment?


I'd say he was getting head from Machamp and put it back to hide evidence. Why would he let have him in the car with him otherwise?
This is not even dark Jesus Christ 
I fucking love how he just stood there and finally decided to reload. 
Close brush? More like 'tongue-kissing Death and fondling his no-nos'.
That was a quick repost
I love fallout 4 and I miss playing it so much but every time I get on I'll be so immersed in the game and it will freeze. 
I like how he cocks his head slightly towards the gun like he squeezed the trigger a couple of times and finally realized that it was empty 
wow its almost like i saw this in video form from the original creator yesterday weird
\*clickclickclick*

Oh yeah, 6 bullets, shit. What was that breeze? 
Only slightly related, but what helmet is that? Sadly I now have to have one. 
Has a mod come out that allows you to turn off the cinematic aspect of V.A.T.S?
Plugging the raider in the head with his revolver, the Sole Survivor screamed in fright and threw his gun to the ground once he realized the stiff breeze racing past him was the shell of a mini nuke. "Holy shit, I almost died!" He cried out, watching a distant explosion.

A few hundred feet away, the Vault Tec sales representative saw a glint on the ground. "Oh, boy! A shiny new bottle cap!" He gasped with surprise and joy, taking the cap into his hand. "It looks like everything's turning around for me today!" He slowly stood, flipping the cap in his fingers. Turning on his heel, he's immediately attacked by a wild mongrel, which clamps it's jaws down on his inner thigh. Yowling in pain, he flailed. The world went supernova as the mini nuke landed.

Miraculously surviving the explosion but thrown far from the blast, the Vault-Tec representative struggled to catch his breath, his wheezing alerting a nearby squad of Super Mutants.

Clipped through your shoulder. Should have died.
"He's reloading. All need to do is roll higher than a 1."

"Fuuuuuuuuuu..."
The best part was squinting to see the gif.
I was just there a couple hours ago!
The guy probably feels like Frieza when he missed Goku at close range when he went Super Saiyan. 
NOT EVEN CLOSE BAYBBEEE
Passing a class by 1 percent.
That was more tense than a mooses butt during fly season
Was that a shoulder fired nuke????
Repost of another user, typical karma stealing.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/5f8w4q/i_screamed_the_whole_time/

*pop* *click* *click* "Oh! Gotta reload! Hang on a sec." *pop* *pop*
I, too, try to avoid a Fat Man to the face.
Ill give you credit, you waited almost a day. 
There is zero self-preservation A.I. with Fallout NPCs
One day we'll be telling our grandkids stories about our virtual battles in virtual wars. Just as our grandparents tell us of stories of... Actual.. Battles in, actual... Wars...
Yup. My butt puckered.
Close Shave with death... That mini-nuke had its way with you then left
Aries this shit sweet asab
*whistling intensifies*
Haha I played this part earlier today 
Freak'in awesome clip. 

I have my criticisms of Bethesda's direction, but I can't help but love it. 
Yep lol 
Where did he get that mask?
Damn, I'm always bitching about people bitching about reposts, but wasn't this front page a few days ago? I need to get off Reddit for awhile it seems.
I swear to god this was posted less then a day ago.
[Hey this kinda happened to me too!](http://imgur.com/gallery/MQaDD6p)
At least the game doesn't crash when biggie smalls come out in vats unlike fallout 3.
Misred the title as "Close brush with teeth". Thought the mini-nuke would graze his teeth or something..?
That was a quick repost
you stole this bro
i can clearly see the "oh god when was the last time i saved?" moment
this is already getting reposted? Damn.
am I the only one who started actually aiming in Fallout 4 instead of using V.A.T.S? I feel like I've been more accurate (In most situations)
This video was posted like yesterday, and now someone made it into a gif and gets 5k+ karma, without any credit to author. This site sucks.
He just stood there and looked at his gun as if it was going to reload all by itself 
I wish that asshole would miss *me* more often. Can't count the number of times I forgot about that jerk on top of Gunner Plaza only too hear the tell-tale whistle of the football of doom when I got too close.
This subreddit makes good gifs but has the worst comments. 95% of the time the comments are just "This is a repost".
Are you playing on easy?
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooke
Hey this isnt your content
Gunner has terrible aim bro.
hit with that jank..
Leave the vault they said, it'll be a lot of fun they said.
i know exactly what mission this is and I cant finish it because the scribe is missing. i guess i will never be part of the brother hood
I like how he falls forward after being shot with a .44 Magnum in the face.
What game is this please? 
Oh.Holy.Shit.
This happened to me three times today, and I don't even play this game.

I love when this happens. VATS is amazing. 
If my almost 200 hours of FO4 has taught me anything, you wouldn't have taken a lick of damage anyway in VATS
Scuuuuuuse me
This is all kinds of perfect.
This was posted yesterday..
I never understood re-posting in such a short period of time.  Enjoy your fake internet points i guess.
What kind of armor is that
Barely a day before repost
That rocket passed by at the same speed as a super Mario smiley canon bullet...
IT'S ONLY BEEN 2 DAYS! HOW DID THIS REPOST GIF GET SO SMALL?!?
this video has already been posted, good way to get post karma I guess...
This was so good. 
I like how he just stands there for a second and looks at his gun like 
 *BAM BAM click click click* "...you gotta be fucking me right now"
Annnnd code brown 
You're a close brush with death.
Seriously have no idea why people like this game. Such crap.
the best part is the raider didn't even think twice about ending his own life by firing off a close nuke, he knew he was dead anyway so why not try to take out the survivor while he's at it
I thought it said "Brush your Teeth" I was so confused
Someone should invent a brush is the shape of the Grim Reaper. Then, every morning you could say you had a 'brush with death.'
Fallout 4 was one of the first games I got after getting back into gaming after around 5 years. I heard so much about the series and I wanted to try it out. I loved it at first, seemed like it's as good as it gets, but after playing dark souls, witcher 3 and some other games... I realized this game sucks ass... the game is so laggy i couldn't even finish that robot expansion. It's also very repetitive, fighting mechanics sucks and feels kinda clumsy ... to bad because this was the first fallout I tried and after that experience I don't think I will ever play fallout series again.
Literally cringed 
Now that's some good humor.
/r/hitboxporn
My favorite part is the way the gunner spins right around after getting shot in the head. 

I can just hear him saying, "Excuuuuuuuuuuse me?"
OH GOD MY SIDES!!!.

More amazing than the time michaeljackson came over to my house to use the bathroom!
It's like this every damn time. No one in this game has a sense of their own mortality when it comes to launching a fat man at a dude 10 meters away.
It's okay, in vats that wouldn't even drain half your health 
How come he uses a helmet instead of a ballistic weave hat? Why would anyone for that matter, excluding how badass it looks lol. 
Calculated.
was this not front page last week from the FO4 sub?
What kind of armor is that and where can I get it? 
Lol I love this
How do you post a gif like this and have it immediately play? I keep getting a URL when I post mine.. 
That armor you're wearing is badass. 
Is it me or does this somewhat resemble the map "Carrier" from Black Ops II?

This is the best gif ive ever seen ahahaha
This will never not be funny. 
almost got nuked
Whytf isn't he crouching 
You could smell the paint on the nuke as it flew by
That was awesome. Where did u get the helmet
Shit I need to come back and play fallout 4. Bought it on launch day. Spent tons of hour immerse in it and all the side missions killed it for me. After a million time of go kill this and retrieve that, i just lost interest in the game. Still crave for it sometimes tho. I guess I just need to continue the main mission and back to side missions later. Fallout 4 should have made their main story much longer.
One of the greatest things I've ever seen 
Holy hell praise the Lord that was close 
3rd time I've seen this in 2 days
That mini nuke just grazed him
What armor is the player character wearing? Is that a mod?

HOW COULD YOU MISS HE WAS *THREE FEET IN FRONT OF YOU*

Can we please have the option of flaring the title with the name of the game?  
If raiders can chuck molotovs with extreme precision from long distances how did this guy miss??
I think I've seen this before
Can you at least credit the original poster of this?
So intense when you wait for your character to reload...
His helmet has a significant nose! Is it Squidward in there?
How did the guy with the mini nuke planned to survive the explosion?
Every skill point counts
That's my new reaction guf when the joke goes *whoosh*

Lawton Treadwell "LT " Close is a lawyer and a well-known consultant to the rich and pampered in New York City. Their names and faces constantly appear in the headlines, but LT sees them regularly in his office. He knows how the crime game is played-and sometimes the game is deadly.It's 1995, the economy is overheated, and someone is masterminding the thefts of famous paintings. The last person who attempted to uncover the thief's identity is dead. Now it's LT's turn to start asking the questions. He faces this challenge with only Max Kelly, his trusted man-of-action; Dickie Douglas, his new age personal trainer; and Teddy Martin-Smyth, his industrial designer girlfriend, whose designs include marriage by any means.

My sister used to play video games with me.  I think the exact day she stopped, we were playing Duke 64 together and she was flying around and she thought she knew where I was (of course she was looking at my half of the screen).  I saw her just floating in mid air looking in the wrong direction.  I watched patently as the rocket closed in on her as her entire focus was waiting for me to pop out still looking in the wrong direction.  The moment she died, I laughed hysterically.  That was the last time she played with me.  She said I cheated.  She flat out admitted to looking at my screen but since she was wrong I should have told her.  I laughed harder.
Their expressions make it seem like they've never enjoyed playing games. 
Hey! That's my room!
So who is better?
Historical proof that games drive families further apart.
I've seen some videos that start like this...
2008 sister looks like Tara from the walking dead 
What is this a coffee commercial?
rare and cool
/r/wincest 
What grown ass man has xbox pajama pants?
Oh my god, she got the Mad Catz controller :(
You didn't actually give her a controller that was plugged in?
This is the first time I being sad about not having a sister/brother. This would be gooood.
Marry him!!!
Awesome
Dude needs to upgrade his pants.
Plot twist...they are cousins 
You look like Barney from Half Life 2
r/frugal will be happy to see him using his favorite shirt from the '90s as night night jammies now
Glad you told us which was most recent I almost thought the top left was from a few months ago. 
I wish me and my brother could play video games together. Unfortunately, we'd murder each other.
My sister and I use to play vidya games together. One of my most vivid memories was playing Secret Of Mana on the snes with her. One of the many things I miss about her.
I have those xbox PJ's! Never, ever go commando in them :| 
I have those same Pajamas!!!
Your sister is gorgeous 
I wonder how often they had sex?

2008-2016 still not boob growth.

Omg it's zelda!
As it's a repost, that can only mean this was yet another party op was not invited to
I too love any girls costume that show a lot of leg.
i love glass sliding doors. still very futuristic to me.

*Twins* huh? .... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
One has short hair, the other has long. **COSPLAY RUINED!**
Nice Peter Pan outfit!

....If I'm attracted to this Link....am I gay?
But they switched half way though. 

Their friends have come to expect that, just move past it. 
So, one of the twins chose the slutty version.
Plus they are hot, so that helps....


We know which one is the hot one 
T H I C C
Hello legs
Slutty Link and Slutty Dark Link in blackface 
Is....is this racist? 
Pretty dope :)
Why does the girl on the right look like Spenny
Cool costumes, but if I remember correctly Dark Link had red eyes? That'd be so sick if they got red contacts. 
TIL you wear belts around your stomache...
Poor shadow Link got backed into a corner and hit on all night.
29 two for fiddy!
No Pan?
So that's what Zelda would look as a girl.
r/upvotedbecausegirl
Peterpan and his shadow!
TIL "Black Face" is okay if it's cosplay

Edit: chill, it's a joke 
Doesn't Link wear pants? Was it necessary her costume had to be a short dress?
No.
I guess I'll be the one to ask the question everyone wants the answer too. You fuck em?
Dibs!
So Black Face is okay again?
Zelda and Morgan Freeman? 

Don't exactly see how those two match up. 
You gotta make the lips funny!

When will white folks learn that blackface is NEVER acceptable?  
Hah. I'm playing through Dying Light right now.

What a crazy good game. It kind of went under the radar from what I remember. Looks like the campaign is going to take awhile though. 
Haha had one of these on my bedroom floor for like 15+ years :S
What a good game. I'm hoping there is a new DLC or DL2 on the way.
Never had a game like Dying Light + The Following (wich is one of the best Price/Performance DLCs out there)
What is it supposed to be from?
That's the same carpet I have in my living room
They even made the different fibers in the carpet go in different directions like it was stepped on. This is some next level carpet rendering. 
Silent Hill?
I had one of these rugs when I was a kid, it is still on the floor of my old bedroom.
I forgot Dying Light existed, bringing back the memories
This is one of those games where I play it from time to time and then another game comes along or I get back into a game I'd already been playing and I kinda forget this one exists. It really is a pretty fun game though. One day I'll finish the campaign.

Also that play mat looks 10x better than the real one I got for my son. 
Watch those wrist rockets!
The first battle front was pure gold and the space battles in II were really cool. Idk how they fucked this up.
I miss the old Star Wars, straight from Pandemic^TM Star Wars,

Chop up the droids Star Wars, get on the point Star Wars,

I hate the new Star Wars, the "no campaign" Star Wars,

The "health regen" Star Wars, the "power-up" Star Wars,

I gotta say, at that time I'd like to breathe Star Wars,

See I rewatched Star Wars, there wasn't any Star Wars,

And now I look and look around and there's so many Star Wars,

I used to love Star Wars, I used to love Star Wars,

I even had the collectors edition I thought I was Star Wars,

What if EA made a game about Star Wars, 

Called "I miss the old Star Wars"? Man, that'd be SO Star Wars,

That's all it was Star Wars, we still love Star Wars,

And I love Star Wars like EA loves DLC

Man, trying to defend the Rhen Var Harbour in BF1 as the Rebellion - then the AT-AT rounds the corner and just demolishes the place. So epic, loved that map. And the bottleneck in the tunnels.
Was just talking about this with a friend the other day. We tried the new battlefront again after a few months of no play and quite halfway through our first game. They took such a massive shit on what should have been easy money it's incredible.
Aint nothin a couple hundred dollars of DLC can't fix
That feel when a game from two console generations has more features than a current gen title...
You guys know BFII is on Steam, right?
*"You can blame it all on me"*
yeah, its like 2 bucks on steam just buy it.
Oh man, one of my favourite things to do after coming home from school was grinding up Legendary(?) rank for all the battle upgrades and such
Visuals and sound were top notch though.
Oooooo...member KOTOR!
Guys I mean damn if you miss BF I & II so much we can make a new one. (It wouldn't be Star Wars by brand but all the mechanics would be the same) I love those games as much as anyone but the formula seemed simple enough, if I put in a solid weekend or two into it I could have a bare bones gameplay demo. Then crowd-fund it, not spend the money on coke and hookers, grow it, the whole drill.

Just putting it out there, it seems like this void is still there and nobody has hit the nail on the head yet.


THEY'RE FLANKING US
I've enjoyed the new battlefront... 
Can't believe all the DLC heroes are all cunts with blasters, so lame.
I know I'm in the massive minority here but I really enjoy the new Battlefront. Now, I absolutely love the old ones too but I new there needed to be updates and changes. 
 
The first flaw and probably the thing that disturbs me the most... No campaign... Seriously, what the actual fuck were they thinking? The campaign in any game is key and I think is the real heart of any game and this game just lacks it. It truly is disappointing. 

The second flaw for me is the lack of prequels. I get sick and tired of people shitting on the prequels. The fact that Disney seems to be distancing themselves from them is saddening. I don't deny the problems with the prequels but I grew up with them and love them for what they really are. Battlefront gave you the ability to fight on 4 fronts... and now I get only 2? That's just stupid.

Third we have our hero and power ups. While I quite enjoy the ranges of Heroes and Villains we are getting, vehicles, heroes, and power ups can all be camped and can ruin any match for a player. (That guy that's going 57 and 5 in Walker Assault is frozen on the AT-AT spawn like he's Han Solo in carbonite.) 

Next we have our maps... at first it was absolutely pitiful. I played the same 6 maps practically with little to absolutely no change. Since then they have added more maps (Free and DLC) which has helped improve it but at first release the lack of maps turned many people away which I don't blame at all. You can't release a game with so few maps and expect people to play it forever. I want variety, not repetition. 

And don't even get me started on survival mode.  

In the light of all the darkness there are some positives too. Absolutely no one can deny that this new one is absolutely beautiful. Regardless of how beautiful this game is doesn't make up for its massive flaws.

The Heroes and Villains are very well done in my opinion. I would have loved to seen even more variety but I'm happy with what they have and what they have been adding. 

Ships definitely seem more fluid and flying is much easier to do. I miss the real space battles with more things to do than just shoot each other down but I think this is a good start and hope to see it in the next Battlefront. 

Guns. Whoever said they didn't have enough options is stupid. There are plenty of options. And they keep adding more. Balancing weapons at first was poor but it has greatly improved and I would say there is no absolute gun better than the other, and that now it comes down to the players skill instead of the weapon in their hands. 

Hutt Contracts are a huge improvement to the game I think. It forces you to use items you normally wouldn't, to achieve new things. I would have never originally thought of using the things I use now without trying to get the other items.

They could have gone many ways with this game, continuing where Battlefront 2 left off (but then critics would complain there is no original element), they could have re-skinned Battlefield (but again, not original and for those who don't like Battlefield would be forced to play in that style), or they could try to be more original, keep the name, take elements from everything and make something of their own. All 3 have their advantages and disadvantages and I would have been happy with either 3.

I fucking love Star Wars and I fucking love this game. There are so many things they could have done better and I would make many changes to improve the game but sadly my voice will be lost in the wind. I hate that other people can't enjoy this game the way I do but I hope when they release the new one, it is what everyone wants and so much more, I hope they hear the fans and listen to make those changes. 
What I have found is that multiplayer focused games are heavily dependent on the audience. If the audience moves, away, the gaming experience is lost. I miss the time when multiplayer meant people coming your house to play a game.
I hate the bullshit, "We removed conquest and classes to differentiate it from Battlefield." 

The game was made as a Battlefield clone, that's what made it good! So they decided to remove anything that made it slightly unique from the generic shooters. Yeah, that makes no sense, but I'd have rather had a Battlefield clone. 
Conquest and classes were what made Battlefront, Battlefront.

I can't explain
Tell that to Kanjiklub
Loved this game, god I remember seeing the alpha footage of the original Battlefront 3 and seeing the ground to space fights, ship boarding, new weapons and just pretty much laying on the floor feeling dead when I heard it was canceled. Then I hear Dice is making A new battlefront and I just wet myself thinking "Oh my god.... this is going to be epic!!!" I watched the trailers of them taking detailed pictures and drawings and looking at the actual props from the movie just squealing with joy. Played the beta and thought "This is weird. But hey its Dice, they won't fuck it up." Bought the game on release day and played it alot thinking to myself "Wow this is awesome!!!" Then I finally tell myself that "This isn't Battlefront, its just some arcade game!" 

I'm still hoping Dice will learn from this and make Battlefront what its supposed to be.

edit: still can't get over how that clone holds the blaster.
yo don't get me started this game was my shit
1. Buy SBFII on steam
2. Download mods
3. ........
4. Profit$$$
The battlefront series is what truly pushed me into gaming, great fucking memories with SWBF2 with my lil sister! It was literally everything I ever wanted still the greatest game I've played. The new one is a water downed overpriced battlefield reskin 
At least on the miniatures side of gaming, Star Wars fans are having a golden age in terms of game quality.

Shame video gamers can't feel that joy :(
Is that Joshua Jackson as the Jedi?
That swiffer commercial is one of the few that legitimately made me laugh
I want more clone v droid stuff. The clones are so badass and I could really care less about rebel scum. I want the old school battlefront back and not in episode 4 and up. 
I had the SWBF3 files on my computer for ages. Unfortunately they were for the 360 and I don't have one of those so they eventually just disappeared. I never could find the PC version. I know there are some people that have it, I actually messaged one of them asking for it but he was a real cunt and wouldn't share (something about "preserving it for the future," cuz that's definitely how digital media works ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ )
This is so relatable it's unreal. I miss it so much. 
I miss the old Kanye 
Just fired that up earlier tonight! :D
Realized i couldnt quickdash stab and stopped playing immediately 
Is EA Battlefront that bad?
Got my up vote. For old times sake.
You don't have to miss it, you can play it any time ;) (although multi-player is dead, they still make cool mods for it) 
So Shit
So typical...
Battlefront 2 with the new Battlefront's graphics would probably be the best thing ever
Member cheebacca? 
Truly the golden age of FPS (though it was really more over the shoulder). The dodge mechanic in Battlefront II was the most helpful mechanic ever
I remember accidentally buying Battlefront II instead of the first when I had rented the first from blockbuster weeks before. Best mistake I ever made 
Unfortunately things are only going to get worse with greedy companies like EA. Unless we stop pre-ordering and hold them accountable for their lies like it was done for NMS. Having to pay nearly $120 dollars to get the full experience of a game is ridiculous and those that willingly give up the cash for these games are going to hurt the quality of the games. Battlefront had so much potential the game is beautiful and the sound effects are top notch but selling the game in parts ($15 per dlc) really shits on their customers. 
But....I enjoy the new StarWars Battlefront...
:'(
As an FYI, Battlefront 2 is on steam if you feel like playing it again. I bought it over the weekend because it was on sale....that ended yesterday. Still, it's only 10 bucks.
*You can blame it all, on, me....*

:(
Roses are red
Violets are blue
I miss the old you,
Star Wars Battlefront 2
They should have remastered battlefront 2 instead of making a shite new one. 
Immediately thought:

> *"M-BABY! BABY COME BACK! MMM-BABY!" <electrocutes Baby>*
It's on steam.....
It's on steam 
I still play this game.  I need to reinstall it because the sound glitches out and will create irritating audio loops but I still play it.
At least they had the decency to not call this one "Battlefront 3". Its like the new ghostbusters. 
Modders are making a spiritual successor to battlefront called Galaxy in turmoil. Demo is supposed to be ready Q3 2017.
My most played game on steam. Well over a month spent on nostalgia. 
Download gameranger and come play. If you have steam
I still have battlefront two for my Xbox and for my PSP I think it's the only game I bought twice for different "consoles" (whatever you consider the PSP handheld in my opinion) but that's the only game I don't regret buying twice because I still play it on both systems and have a blast 
I miss the old battlefront..... 
Personally I'm just thankful to play in such a gorgeous Star Wars environment after being patient and paying a grand total of $10 for mine, so I couldn't be more happier about it. 

I cannot get enough of Fighter Squadron! It's absolutely incredible. 

We're still doing this shit?
Score one for the Republic.
Galactic conquest hhnnngggggggg
Angels Fall First.
Maybe Battlefront II II will begin to make things right.
They could have at least remastered Battlefield II with the graphics of the current one (and updated for current gen platforms). Just think of how awesome that would be; I'd buy in a heartbeat!
🎵You can blame it all on EA🎵
idk if you know this but you could just go onto steam and play it now instead of creating this shit post 
Member Chewbacca ? I member. 
This subreddit is at facebook levels.
Battlefront 2015>Battlefield 4



Fight me.
yay EA just had to get there fucking mits on it and Disney had to ruin the cannon being scared shitless of the prequals. and I'll admit the prequals weren't vary good movie wise but it gave us  the cool ass droids and aliens the jedi order and order 66 and a lot more. 

and not to mention this being the dark ages of DLC every damn thing and EA loves breaking up there games like some fast food deal having to pay 5.99 for offline bots and then 15.10 for space battles and crap.   
For fucks sake I'm sick of this meme. Hey did you know Battlefront 2 was a re skinned Battlefield 1942? They have basically similar models, same instant actions mode and similar vehicles. And for fucks sake you cry about space battles (even thought they're in the game now) even though it was repetitive shit. Yes you'll say it wasn't when you were young because of some bullshit reason but, You were young! Stop letting nostalgia blind you.
Have to say SB2 was much better on original Xbox then PC. How is it so bad on PC?
Maybe they had a gentleman's agreement.
When there's only so many spots on the map you can camp out of harms way and be completely useless for the entire round, you have to share.
I feel like you should have stood there protectively the rest of the game. 
I like that you didn't waste 20 minutes t bagging him or doing something stupid.
that little tap with the knife haha that's when you panic and spam the button. gotta make sure you kill him before he gets you
I'm colorblind, I couldn't figure out why he was staring at his squad mate so weird, then he killed him and I figured out that it was an enemy...

Side note, why doesn't Battlefield 1 have colorblind assist on console? When hardcore comes out, it'll be unplayable for me because I can't tell the difference between friends and enemies.
Explanation for those who don't get it: the two people lying by the rock are on different teams, but didn't notice one another.
So much of this in sniperfield 1. I got my melee dog tag after two days of being one of maybe 5 players not sniping. Hardcore can be painful, with teammates standing 2 feet from the person who shot you, and not noticing.

BF1 has turned into metal gear for me. After I got my sniper tags/medal it became a game of "can I sneak into the fort covered in snipers". 

Yes. You can. And they don't see the hatchet coming.
That look back & fourth doe 
Campers....campers everywhere..They should call it Camperfield or Sniperfield
Knife job!
Always good to check your rear every so often, never know if the enemy is trying to flank you.
Seriously serious question... How do you get the circle/dot in the middle of your cross hairs to continuously stay active instead of just appearing when sprinting? 
It was a forbidden love...
Target shooting competition
This probably happens a lot in war 
/u/acenair836 
And this is why as a scout player, I have cast off my scope of shame, and now play iron sight scout.

Maybe throw on a 2x marksman variant for a bit of counter sniping every now and again.
"the fuck is this. the fuck is that? the Fuck?" 

how I imagine OP is thinking. 
Leave them alone. They just want to be elite MLG snipers!
I saw this the other day in Modern Warfare Remastered except no rock in between, facing the same damn direction.
lmao
When a teammate/squadmate likes to lay down in the grass or hills 2.5 miles away from the nearest objective i will spawn on them as a medic with smoke grenades and rifle grenades (smoke) and just sit there putting down smoke on top of them over and over until they get the fucking hint.
I think it will cumulate in thousands of guys with robot dick massagers watching twitch streams of a girl giving head to a pressure sensitive dildo. Then there will be an Esports dick sucking league where the best of the best dick suckers compete for Reddit gold. I'm calling it now. 
Wait, wasn't it the main reason people came up with VR in the first place?
Full disclosure, in case anyone cares: I originally posted the GIF in the top right corner; that's my coworker trying the Leap Motion Orion demo (he's not watching porn). 
People make jokes about VR but if you have ever seen how the movie Avatar was filled I think there is potential there. If you have ever played laser tag you know what I'm talking about.  

Imagine a warehouse environment were everybody is participating in the same VR environment. 

I'm not sure if the technology will really become a main stream home presence like a TV or Xbox.  However I feel certain that we will see VR arcades.  
Its amazing how VR can look more and more affordable without the price even changing.
I bought a moderate VR headset from Best Buy for $30 almost entirely to try out VR porn.  


My only regret is that the post orgasm aftershame is immense. 
she looks like she has a package
Source is a VR game called [Waifu Simulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/5fambx/waifu_simulator_19_is_out_%CA%96/?st=iw3uasie&sh=a3a6c919).
Is Rem included?

Asking for a friend...
That face, that face that the girl is making.  That face will be the new reaction of mothers who catch their sons masturbating in the future.
To be fair, Porn will give VR endless amounts of funding which in turn will lead to higher quality headsets and experiences (and not just in that sense). I mean it's pretty much the reason why Blu-ray beat HD disc, and why 4k resolution is reality. So to sum up, if the porn industry backs your product, they're going to (no pun intended) pimp the hell out of it.
The look in her eyes.

*"I'm watching my world die..."*

You will live long enough to see bars with no cover charge for men.  
The two images are unrelated. And they are not BF-GF just co workers at a VR studio. She filmed that with the pouty face as a joke.
/r/rule34overwatch would like this. That looks like Widow.
I've always known that VR was going to be primarily a medium for forever alones like myself to actually experience something slightly close to intimacy. 
I...I... think the waifu has balls....
Was reading all these comments and totally forgot I was on r/gaming lol was a shock when I hit the back button.
I am going to randomly post the source mentioned in Imgur:

Dat Rem Blowjob though
The real inevitable outcome will be that their won't even be a need for a girlfriend.  To be born 30 years later....
That's an... awfully mountainous pubis mons. There's absolutely no problem with it if that's your thing, but it looks like she's packing a full sack. 
VR is future !
The only other thing I could imagine what be to just look at textures of NiCage all day long.
How well it can handle distributing porn has been a deciding factor for several new media technologies.
They say women don't need men anymore, but I think quite the opposite is about to be true.
Porn pioneers tons of New technology
That's Eva Hoerth VR enthusiast

Last generation had VHS tapes and CDs for porn, this generation has pornhub and other such websites, and the next generation will be able to all but feel the acts of sex. The generation after that will likely be able to feel with special equipment and eventually virtual sex will become more pleasurable than real sex and real sex will go out of style. In 500 years we will be history and our great grandchildren will look back on us, baffled by the fact that we did such a crude thing as masturbate.
Set 1! Set 2! Hut-hut HIKE!
The real scenario will be a guy furiously jacking off oblivious to his mom standing over him.
that's awful lot of bulge 
Well if women can have their toys to help get them off without my assistance.  Then damnit I want to have some toys also! 
Dat expression tho.
I know this will happen.  What I want to happen with VR is to play games like Skyrim and Fallout4 as if I was there.  Porn is easy but real immersion into a game will be freaking awesome.
It's a shame the future of technology looks like it's from 20 years ago... Last time I saw this many polygons MGS1 had mindblowing graphics.

Edit; It was sarcasm, I know how intensive it is. I'll just wait a couple years for it to be 4k ;)
You can see the moment where it clicks in her head, "No Shit! I am one of those girls, I am one of those girls with weird boyfriends that I always judge.  Better go download Tinder..."

That's a hot IRL girl.

I'd play with her, instead.
You mean 'planned outcome,' right?

god damn, widow has a big ol' front bulge.
CNN: BREAKING NEWS
This season on Extreme Catfishing: Cyber Lulz.
Doesn't pornhub have VR porn that isn't controllable , but still viewable?
>inevitable

>not intended 
Anyone else notice hes not even holding any controllers?
I see a horny future similar to Ready Player One
Widowmaker for sure, Cuz he's a dead man.
It actually is the inevitable outcome though lol. 
Widow does have a nice butt...
And there we have it, everyone.  The future.
Those graphics have a ways to go.

To be fair, I'd play the hell out of it now, but it's a little blocky for my taste.
I could like this emensely when it comes out
I weep for the future.
I heard about this company that's dedicated to filming porn in first person for VR
Is that bayonetta with a Dick?.
My S7 came with a free GearVR. Netflix is nice, a few of the games too... but yeah. The one downside is the best videos are hard to find without actual purchase, since it's still pretty niche.
Hey fuck this video.  Eva is the shiznit.
The future is here BOIS!
This illustrates so clearly the shenanigans women have to put up with with guys. 
This repost, again?
Now there's even less of a reason to get married 
Black guy with white VR hands, the ultimate in breaking immersion.
Hey I know the woman in the picture. She's super cool. She a huge proponent for women in VR/tech. Sadly, I think this meme is completely the opposite of what she stands for.
"Tech advances or 2 reasons: 1) More efficient killing and 2) Porn" aye imgur comments speaking wisdom once again
Come to Butthead
"Step into my Parlor" said the spider to the fly. 
Is pleasure not an evolutionary incentive to reproduce? Does this mean that we're gonna have a serious depopulation issue because relationships are tedious and technology isn't??
Have we not learned from Japan!?
i like how his hands don't correlate to the motion happening in the game.... and there's no gear on his hands that would make the hands in the game grip. 
what anime is this
If she ain't got a dick, she ain't slick
What is this "outcome" business? The first thing anyone does with a new discovery is to figure out ways of fucking it.
What a time to be alive!
inevitable? you mean one of the first outcomes
The single biggest threat to today's gynocracy.

Bring it on, I say!
If she lends a hand instead of being all like this, this wouldn't even be a thing.
Wait a minute he's not holding any hand controllers.. what magic is this? Edit : ok nvm i see that that's not actually the guy playing. 

Still begs the question wtf is that guy doing with his hands?
I did this with the VR and a real girl sucking my dick. It was amazing, day 1 PS VR
do you think virgins will be able to learn how to touch a woman through VR? Every time I see one of these demonstrations all I see is Steve Carell for the first time. 
Better than the real thing
Vanu Sovereignty from **Planetside 2** is making some tech advances I see.  
I dont understand this at all, at the end of the day your hands are still touching nothing but air.  Wtf is the point you just look like a desperate moron.  Just go to a strip club
Am I the only one seeing a bulge?
lmao, the look on her face is priceless.
And they said VR would never be popular in low income homes. 
 
 https://youtu.be/FcNTEyEqxH0?t=2m46s
whats the deal with the look on her face?
There are 2 things that always follow new tech being adopted:

1) Video games

2) Porn
I love the look of disapproval on the woman's face. Like she wouldn't ride a CGI dick until she perforated her uterus. 
Porn helped filmed, vhs, bluray, online payments. Porn will drive VR.
Some bulge on that "woman" 
No drama, no bitching, same level of pleasure - sounds like a trade-off to invest a lot of R&D for.

Sorry ladies, future looks like it'll require you to step up your game.
That chic's face says it all.  She knows she's obsolete. 
Stop having such a stank face and let him touch yo booty any time and shut up with the I'm too tired or have a headache crap! 
Hahaha
I have a galaxy gear and tried but the video plays in a movie theater so that was annoying
How is this nsfw
I love how unamused the actual waifu looks while he's doing this.
Haha her look of complete dissapointment.

Blizzard is working hard on a Virginwatch VR

this has to be fake right?... i mean he isnt using any controllers, unless he controls it with a kinect or something
I'd by an Occulus for this.
Uh totally fake, he doesn't have the Vive controllers in his hands.
Just being a guy.

Tiger woods was married to this insanely hot Scandinavian model. He still strayed with prostitutes. 
At least this guy is just acting out some fantasy and that's hopefully that and spends more time with his wife later 
I wonder how many people are going to lose their virginity this way? One day soon the number of people losing their virginity virtually will probably far outnumber those losing it through normal means.
You know, she could probably do a killer Widomaker cosplay. 
Women better start stepping thier game up
yeah?...so? you afraid of losing your power over men, little girls?
Obviously this is a joke but that girl is cute as fuck and if she were even sitting in the same room as me id be really happy, like what the fuck man. 
Take that look off your face, bitch. If you did your job, we wouldn't be here
[deleted]
The best game. Hundreds of hours of my college life right here. I still have "comon" by Go betty go on my phone and everytime I listen to it I am reminded of all the face I wrecked in this game. 
I wonder if we can still netplay! 
Haha that game was great. Still have it for the original xbox.
Bring back Burnout, best arcade racer ever!!!
I was SO disappointed in Burnout Paradise. It was an OK racing game...but I missed those structured crashes :(

Burnout 3 FOREVER
That's where I learned what a shunt is.
I wish they would reboot this for PC.

I only played this through the demo on Need For Speed Underground 2. 

I played the demo more than I played the actual NFS game. 
That one's good. Sean Murray worked on it and actually finished the game.
Finally somebody posts the good Burnout.

All these gamer babies keep posting Revenge. Revenge wasn't even *good*, kiddo. 
I agree. Everything they made after was deteriorated. Give me another game like this and I'm a happy man.
this was my middle school life. no joke. god i miss it so much. made some of my first online friends through this game. RIP burnout franchise
Aww that game was awesome.  I never play racing games, but this is easily my favorite racing game of all time.  It was just pure arcade fun, far from realistic.  So good.
10/10
I had so much fun with Burnout. I wish the same team make a next gen one, that would be the best in the world.
I hope we get this on PS4 at some point.
Played this game ALL the time when I was younger. Was so into this.
Just think of all the Sean Murray anti-memes with this game, seen as though he was technical director on Burnout 3?
Some of the devs from this game released a similar title called Dangerous Golf.  It's obvious when you play, because they re-used a ton of assets/mechanics from Burnout 3.  Hell, they even brought back Stryker to do the little intro video.

It's not nearly as fun as Burnout, but it kinda/sorta scratches that Crash Mode itch.  

This was my favorite game back in the day! The soundtrack was awesome, the gameplay was awesome, I really wish they would bring it back as a part of a collection or something, at least put it on psNow. 
Burnout Paradise was actually pretty good (we'll pretend Revenge never happened). 

Takedown is classic though. Really fitting soundtrack too. [Youtube playlist for nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_gcrm6Lsvo&list=PLSr82Inu7VRKL8y3opjbUMQgxoLTxmMsd&index=16).
This game is like an ex girlfriend you broke up with only because you went to different colleges and still think about having her back in your life.

So many good memories 
Everyone must have this same thing happen. This is the 3rd one I've seen on the front page this week. Here's mine. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot-0_6NkMpA
Wish the nukes hit each other in mid-air
So a nuke only takes away 60% of the HP... shit game design right there.
Nice
Pretty sure i just heard it whistle past my head irl.
How the hell does a Boomer shrug off a mininuke?
Is the missile launcher actually any good for constant use, or is it more a one-time then switch weapon?
I recognise that place! I went to the same spot but more on the cliff edge, shot one guy and he narrowly missed me too
Is everything made out of cake?
Are you open to criticism? 
This is actually my game. I hope people of r/gaming will enjoy this little gameplay showcase.

The game uses GPU to simulate completely destructible world in realtime. I'm building this game because I think there should be more physics based games.

Genre wise it will be an artillery game like Scorched Earth or Worms.
Glad to see you're making progress! Keep us updated, okay? :)
Because I haven't seen anybody post a link: 

This game has a [indiegogo!](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/physics-based-artillery-game#/) With just 10 more hours on it.

I'm sure this guy would appreciate every cent! Even if its not exactly 20k ;)
As a structural engineer, I can assure you that none of the physics or material properties are correct in this gif.
The architecture is...weirdly organic.
Somehow I don't think a thermal model of a two-dimensional gelatin parthenon matches the title of this post
Reminds me of 'Scorched Earth'.
I agree OP. Red Faction Guerilla still brings me hours of fun just demolishing buildings.
this gif nostalgiad me right in the oe-cake
So you're saying we need a physics/ modelling card to compliment the video and sound cards?
Aren't they supposed to be used to mine bitcoins for profit or something? 
I don't think stone bends that way.
I've never seen icecream pillars explode like that, mildly interesting.
Wow, World War 2 simulator is looking great!
r/GamePhysics
DAE remember pocket tanks?? Gahh... That game was great
Immediately reminded me of Worms.
If the next decade will see more resources poured into hardware and no more resources being routed to mechanics innovation, gaming will be pretty shit.
This looks like fucking garbage. 
I want to play this game.
this is awesome! reminds me a lot of this sandbox physics game i used to play ages ago http://www.scuzzstuff.org/oe_cake/

i loved interacting with the different densities  of fluids/solids and playing with the physics in general, this game looks like it would be a lot of fun for similar reasons :D
i would buy it
Strikes me as strangely erotic.
That doesn't even make sense.
Reminds me of OECake
Game?
Any chance this is open source, I'd love to have a look at the code.
The problem with games like this is that the substances never act properly.
Still impressive though.
Does that have shockwave physics? Never seen that in a game before. 
Looks neat. Awesome work, OP!
I would totally play this. It looks immensely satisfying.
Looks like two AT-ATs taken out by the snow speeders tow cable. 
What are you building this game with?
what game is this!? 
I'm good having both.
Massive physics 
If this physics on the GPU thing had been implemented in Kerbal Space Program would it have improved the performance? I get the feeling my gpu is drinking a beer with its feet on the desk while the poor cpu is carrying bricks to the top floor on his back.
Little Big Planet !
I mean that's basically the EDF design philosophy in a nutshell: same late-PS2 graphics, but a metric fuckton of them with havok physics, lasers, and explosions everywhere.
This kind of physics work will definitely put a game like Scorched Earth back on the map! Ahhh...good times...
dont change anything.
It's a very good jelly simulation. 

What kind of system are you using to simulate the connection between points? Generally with stone you shouldn't give them enough give to rotate like point to point, nor stretch and deform as much. 

Really cool idea. 
This reminds me of that sand game that I used to play in high school where you can have different elements and make weird chemical combinations 
Isn't running fancy physics mostly CPUs job?
Those physics are awful.
I'd take physics over graphics any day.
Stop it ISIS!
this doesn't look fun.
You should check out Exanima on Steam/GOG the physics system is immensely impressive 
Cards do Graphics because the game engine handles physics.
http://i.imgur.com/jEFSFKr.jpg
Hmm good to know , i always thought physics were handled by the CPU. Very timely post as i'm really into learning about this stuff in preparation of building my own pc.
Game name?

I love how the ground moves a bit when you drive on it. It's really satisfying
Is that you Imperial Britain?
Is this a game or a tech demo or something?
Isnt physics the processor's thing?
Oh cool, I didn't know the Parthenon was made out of spaghetti.
Been saying this for years,  couldn't agree more! 
What is this and where can I play it?
The tank is adorable.

I love how you *almost* flipped over at one point, but managed to shimmy it back on its treads.
Hey this game looks really cool, could I have a copy?
Doesn't the CPU handle the physics calculations aspect?
wut gayme iss thes
For some reason or another, this makes me think of Plasma Pong. Add some E.S. Posthumus in there as a soundtrack, and you got yourself a gem.
Im going to be getting inside of you tonight.
Imagine if you could use this technology with inanimate objects instead of soldiers.  Some kind of specialized, expendable piece of metal maybe, that you could "warp" more efficiently into the enemy's body from a longer distance away.

They should also look into using the Titan drop technology with a wider range of payloads, like lightweight robots with minimal armor or guidance systems but loaded full of explosives.
[A telefrag is the best kind of frag.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7oHvaAn7Ds)
Is this game fun? I never played the first one but heard mixed reviews on it. I'm not much of a multiplayer FPS guy, the only one I play is sometimes Rainbow Six: Siege with my friends. Is it worth a try?
I think you can already kinda do this if you manage to time the end of your phase dash. I remember someone posting a gif of them accidentally getting a phase dash kill.
Well, if you  warp a titan into a titan you explode instead of the enemy. FeelsBadMan
Well shit...and here I'm all excited about just getting grand theft semi auto.

Can you be killed while doing this? Cause that's the thing about executing someone in this game, especially when you accidentally do it to a grunt...*you get ded*
I can only assume that getting killed like this marks your killer on the map after respawn. 

Because when a man's been inside you, you know when he's coming.
*Good thing the netcode is so good that melee doesn't feel clunky*

Seriously though, melee is pretty clunky at least on PC. Still a great game.
Back in my day we called that telefragging.
Inside out
I miss UT...
Ah, telefragging.
TELEFRAG
The matrix is back baby! 
Fatalities in fps are straight pointless IMO. It ruins the flow of game play and adds an extra "flair" that I find super unrealistic in a heated battle situation. 
It's called telefragging.
Fatality
[Relevant](https://youtu.be/m2-NBxS01Ww)
Man, I need to play more Mortal Kombat
So you become Shang Tsung
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO THE GENEVA CONVENTION IN THE FUTURE?!
Alright Titian fall u win I'll buy you.
Shang Tsung in Mortal Kombat 2.  This was one of his fatalities. 
What is this, mortal kombat?
I was a little confused about what was happening when I saw this one. 
Yup, telefragged.
It's like the chestburster scene from Alien all over again.
Telefragged!
Nice, just like Neo. 
Animation looks like terrible..
Man, this game looks way too good. Sadly, I missed the sale on PC :/
Why is everyone here talking about how much they miss UT. UT4 is free to play right now and has an incredibly low population. Quake is better BTW. 
You know what would be cool? Seeing all that in first person. Fuck all the third person stuff in Titanfall 2, especially the mech entries.
Coming in expecting a glitch, presented with literal title post.
They need a fatality where you warp into an enemy titan cockpit
Look like one of Fettel's abilities from FEAR 3 (or F3AR if you want to be that guy), probably can't control the person afterwards and use them to kill other people though.
Don't let guys who do that get under your skin. 
So Metal
Damn... didn't even buy dinner. 
Pontypool Style
*FLAWLESS VICTORY*

*FATALITY*
Where'd his gun go????
Has anyone got numbers on playerbase s by platform for this game? I can't decide what platform to get it for..
That's metal af
Man, and i just bought the grand theft auto execution.
Telefrag!
I wanna get in your pants.
Now if only the shinobi titan doesnt explode if u unphase inside another titan
TELEFRAG!
there's a spell in DnD that does this. my character died once in a boss encounter because of it. 
This reminds me that if you use the Ronin ability that allows you to teleport, and "land" inside another titan, it destroys your ronin. Which actually annoys me a lot. I feel that should destroy the other Titan, technically. Although for balance reason that shouldn't happen, it's kinda crappy that it instead destroys you.
My body is NOT ready
Basically a telefrag. Nice.
I am going to lick every part of your body, starting from the inside 
God damn it, I wish I could've purchased this game on Cyber Monday (damn family and their Christmas presents /s), guess I'm waiting for the next sale!
r/noisygifs
Enemy pilot: You wouldn't last ten seconds in my shoes, bitch!

*phase shifts inside enemy pilot exploding him from within*

Me: it would appear, *you are correct.*
Surely an at will telefrag is OP? There doesn't seem to be translocator or telepad or anything.
Is this an homage to tele-fragging from the Doom/Quake days? I'd sure like to think so.
And yet he comes out completely clean. The stain protection is real.
Well, that's horrifying.
Reminds me of prototype!
Mr Anderson
this is unsettling
When you're in the mood but she's not but you know how to warp into her body so you do it anyway
That's some brutal infiltration... shit !

It reminds me of the way FTL jumps work in Battlestar Galactica, they kind of exchange pockets of space and it results in a shockwave on the ships point of arrival, imagine using that on a Titan to warp execute another Titan or destroy the escape ship from the inside :)

EDIT: In a BSG episode, some poor Raptor ships accidentally warped into a mountain, their matter was combined to the rock due to its high density, so you could fail and kill yourself while trying to take down an enemy Titan :D
I bought this game and after just a week it disappeared from my origin library .. contacted the customer support team three times with no reply. I really want to play it again but can't because they fucking suck.
Telefragged!
I like titanfall2 i just wished the titans had more configuration options
...yay?
Oh look a [telefrag](http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Telefrag), I have not seen that in ages.
I must say, I love the anatomically correct gibs.
How to do this?
Modern day telefragging, I like it!
Yeah this dlc is amazing and not only for y'all who remember Angel City from Tf1, it has much more. You guys are gonna love it, im sure.
Prototyp3?
How do you do this? Is it a knife animation in this game? I don't have titan fall 2 but this looks cool and I was curious 😂
I watched this for 2 minutes straight. I want it so hard.
Is that real or a glitch. It looks badass. The more i see of this game the more I want to buy it. Just wish the playerbase was bigger
Yes, we all saw the trailer.
Went from Fifa to GTA real fast
ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?

I love my developed awareness skills from the past BF games. So easy to get grenade kills in BF1. 
I hate to be that guy, but this is not a 'film', and Michael Bay didn't 'direct' it.

Creating even a short film is a lot harder work than simply lobbing  a hand grenade in a game and recording the results.

So please tell it like it really is, without the pretense. This ain't a film, and Michael Bay ain't no director.
VERY GOOD
I would pay for this
Wow, can I ask for an a4 print. What's your PayPal? This is gorgeous 
Looks great now do one on the opposite page of Sif.
this is awesome, so i cleaned it up a bit. 

if you / anyone has issue with this, ill take it down I GUESS IF I HAVE TO

seriously though, good job if that's yours. if not, good find. either way, VERY GOooooh you've heard it.

How can i learn to draw :(

I just can draw stickman
Favorite boss fight from dark souls! Awesome drawing
Love this
Hey that's pretty good. Just for future reference, the plume at the back of the head should appear as a few thick strands at most, as it is 'eternally damp with the abyss'. Other than that one tiny issue, it's really nice.

Great work! Arotrias is one of my favorite NPC/boss fight ever .

Fine work, skeleton.
Nice ink. Not a fan of Artorias's design though. It's an eagle's skull sitting directly on someone's neck. No head. Kind of unsettling, considering he was a hero.
I first read this as "Artosis" and got excited to see the gritty Dark Souls revamp of one of my favorite gaming commentators.

All I see is a fat fish puking....
The secret to how they repair serious damage so cheaply is by charging extremely highly for minor damage.
Its because its a chop shop.  They aren't repairing your car for $800 dollars, they are just replacing it. The $300 for the headlight is a repair.  
I've said this once I'll say it again it's the deductible.  This guy is paying a pretty low premium on a high deductible.  The headlights aren't covered by insurance  
Oh you want this goofy horn? That'll be $25,000
Maybe it's $300 for the time and $15 bucks for the headlights vs $300 for the time and $485 for the... everything
That's just good business sense. You repair a totaled car for cheap, and the driver comes back because they appreciate the service and cheap price.


More people come in because they hear about your low cost, and that's when you sock it to them with the headlight fluid.
This from the same company that charges $36,400 for beaded car seat covers. 
*brings demolished vehicle in* 
"What can we do for you?"
OH I DON'T KNOW YOU TELL ME
And then a flashlight for your pistol costs $20,000.
isn't this a repost? I remember seeing this picture before 
They can afford to charge you less for extreme damage because they overcharge suckers for minor repairs
The GTA Online prices are just stupid. Chrome wheels? 100,000.
If you *scratch* a cutom Benny's car, you will pay at least $950
In your case it looks like he also gave you over 341000$!
Or a horn that costs 100,000 dollars
Have you looked under the hood? They had to completely dismantle the front half to replace the headlight.
Go to bennys auto shop.  That shit will set you back like 2 grand for a fucking scratch.  
That's just the way the car is designed.  You have to replace the engine block along with the lightbulb.
"But the other car's entire front is missing, *including both headlights*!"

"Yeah, but wherever the headlights are, they're still working so that's a savings."
I took one of my cars to Benny's, no scratches or anything at all on the car, and it cost 2500 to repair...
Can you imagine how stupid this would be if it were realistic? People wouldn't jump off roof tops.
I love how this automatically posted to /r/picturesofbrazil because of the los santos in the title.
Insurance pays for part of it if its more fucked up?
Maybe the shop takes advantage of economies of scale.  The cost of manufacturing the front ends of cars goes down as you produce more and Los Santos produces a lot of front ends because this is GTA and cars explode all the fucking time.  So there is a possibility that Los Santos doesn't produce that many spare headlights since they are not prioritized above font ends and as such charges more for them.  
Well the headlight comes in a kit that you already bought above. It's once piece so yeah, you're screwed. 
Cool meme 
I took my car in that was to the point where if I got out it wouldn't have started again,

Call out charge man.
That car looks very nice. Anyone recognize it? 
I took in a vehicle for a mission that was only dirty.  I had to pay 54$ to clean it before I could do get the mission upgrades...
I member when the prices used to be much higher. If I recall Rockstar implemented a minimum and maximum fee. I believe you got hit with bot the minimum and maximum fee for that car but I could be wrong.

Counterstrike taught me that when you are on CT, you want an AK. When you are on T, you want the M4.
That terrorists have better and cheaper weapons than counterterrorists
Go bury an AK in mud for a couple hours, dig it out and you'll still fire fine. Do the same thing with your AR and you're most likely going to end up picking pieces of it out of your face, if it will fire at all. 
Also some people pay stupid amounts of money for digital items!

Hagrid Simulator
Wow, looks great. I love the contrast of the slow pace of the day versus night.
In the day you can fish, cut trees, hunt etc. while at night you have to defend yourself.  Sort of a survival/action game, for Windows, Mac, Linux.  Not sure of the release date (next year sometime I think?).

[Here's the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJptLWXRm2Y)  It recently got through [Greenlight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=792383821).

What a horrible night to have a curse
Andre: the apprentice days. Before the dark sign swept the land
Dang!  He was punching the CRAP out of that one thing.
This looks a LOT like Kingdom. 

Except you're a loner badass instead of helpless recruiter.
Does he have Wooden Nickel tho?
The style reminds me of a slightly less dour [Sword and Sworcery](http://store.steampowered.com/app/204060/). Looks fun :)
They put Dan Harmon in a videogame?!
Came here expecting the Binding of Isaac, but this works too.
I was expecting the gif to end with this.

https://imgur.com/EucIfYY
The Hound is back!
Reminds me of shovel knight.  That's a good thing.

wow kinda reminds me of hyperlight drifers pixel art style. 
For the love of god please come to consoles, this looks super fun. 
One of the enemies looks inspired by "attack on Titan"?
This one's a Keeper.
Perrin Aybara
This looks fantastic, reminds me of Kingdom. Will definitely pick it up when it releases.


It's weird, there's so many great pixel art games coming out recently.
2D Pixels for life y'all. 3D is overrated.
Is this the 2-D brawler/platformer that can fill the void in my heart that Terraria left behind?
I WANT IT
AND I WANT IT NOW
Can I just say that I think the Pixel art is amazing! Everything seems to flow so nicely. What game engine is being used here?
This looks fun.  I will look for it when it hits the store.
Is this a real game? 
Awesome looking game! can it be on Vita?
This would be great with about 4 times the pixels.
I'm on a Pixel game fix (HLD, Kingdom 1 and 2), so I will definitely been looking forward to this. 
Is this for console,PC, or mobile?
Looks a lot like Rogue Legacy. Graphic wise. Man I'm gonna get this sucker when it comes out! 
That looks as fun as Gunpoint!
Alright, what direction should I throw my money this time? 
But, where is Drowzee?
Ok so i need this game now
I'll never get tired of 2D sidescrollers, they've remained my favorite genre ever since I was a kid and there's no genre that gives me a higher feeling of immersion (not even first-person games, surprisingly).

This one looks great, the art style has that warm, familiar, soothing look to it that a lot of the best 2D sidescrollers tend to go for.
I NEED IT.
Hi brother.
This reminds me a bit of superbrothers: sword and sworcery. 
Dan Harmon: The Game is out!?!
Am I the only one who thought "risk of rain?" Exact same art style and that roll is spot on
if there's someone in this thread who wants to make games for a living. I would buy any game that looks just like this. Pixel art is amazing and we DONT have enough games that do them properly
Sandor?
I thought this was Kingdom: New Lands for a second. Great game btw.
Reminds me of Logen Ninefingers
A quick google of "the keeper" returned a menstrual cup instead of this game. 
Vi-ta! Vi-ta! Vi-ta!
The Hound Simulator
This reminds if a little game called "witchmarsh"
I was thinking to myself "what a peaceful game", and then I saw the flash of lightning and thought to myself "were those bodies hanging from the trees?". Then dude rolls and smashes other guy's head in with an axe!
Those animations are so SMOOTH!
This game is what my soul goes through on Mondays. 
Looks like Shovel Knight meets Broforce.
This reminds me of that old samurai Jack flash game that was free to play on cartoon networks website.
Another pixel indie game huh.
I kinda get a "under the sea/garden" vibe from it.  Looks good :) 

Ok this looks sweet
Looks awesome, I hope it's not another "survival rouge-like indie trash with souls difficulty" game
I absolutely despise indie games that try too be hardcore, I just want to play casual platformers, beat em ups and such.
A Pixel indie side-scroller?! Wow never seen anything like it.
Damn that looks badass as heck. I like the survival aspect of it as well.
/r/noisygifs
In the days of easy and free access to Unity and Unreal engines I really don't get the need for every indie game to be pixel art anymore. Gameplay looks great though.
That hand movement when he's working on his bench looks so good, Jesus. That alone got me interested.
How do I play this game?
and...he's doing typical dumb video game shit...what else you got?
Wow, this looks beautiful.  I really hope that events like when the swordsman pulls you out of the tower are spread throughout the game, it looks really cool.
Seems like a fun game. Sweet trailer. I just get the feeling it's kind of a spoiler as too what you'll encounter story and enemy wise.

Please tell me there's much more to it?:)
Dan Harmon simulator? 
This game would be great for ios/android!
Welp, my interest is officially piqued.
Yes, please.
Tom Bombadil - the game.
Damn, those bodies hanging from the tree gave me chills.

This looks amazing.
The new God of War looks great
Looks good 
Same developer as Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery?
Lumberjack vs Zombies
I love 8 bit games.  
Just sayin.
Just beautiful. Love it.
Your gif made me want to play a game. After watching a video trailer I am not so sure anymore. You did a great job. Keep it up.
"But pixelated graphics are just a excuse to make a game ugly for cheap, blah blah blah"
RemindMe! 72 hours
Huh, super cool looking. Definitely gonna keep an eye out for this.
This looks fucking awesome, I'm 100% sure I'm going to get my ass handed to me uncountable times, but I look forward to it
What do you plan to price It? I want to save up. The trailer music and scenery was absolutely beautiful, by the way. Whoever made the music should be pat on the back.
This game looks AWESOME 
remind me of castlevania, i like this style 
I think The Keeper has some inner demons to face .
This reminds me of Bunyan, the lone woodsman featured in the Breath of Fire series, master fighter, wise world-worn all around badass.
Remindme! 1 year
This isn't gonna be on console, huh? :(
But can you play that with an ultrabook and one of those cpu-integrated intel HD graphics cards?

I'm seriously asking. Because Diablo 3 is best played on my laptop at a maximum of 15fps (that's the lowest setting. I wish I could go lower).
Do want!
This looks awesome.
Looka pretty good. I would play it. The one thing I like and think Terraria should add is the way the buildings work. Imagine in Terraria that when you exit a building it becomes background to you could walk past it instead of through it. And then when you go into the building it comes up the the foreground again. 
all i can see is a medieval trucker's delight.
Reminds me of The Hound circa Season 6 GOT.
Is that wreck It Ralph?
Judging by the art style it's the same authors as the Kingdom: New Lands. Looks good, I'll check it out.
I had no idea Hagrid was so violent.
This looks awesome, looking forward to it in the future 
Is it coming on iOS? 
My only criticism is that it isn't an overhead view like Zelda. I feel the horizontal scrolling format isn't gonna keep me interested but ya never know, it looks awesome otherwise 
Great soundtrack, it encapsulates a lot of different emotions depending on scenery in a very smooth way! 
Those opening scenes are beautiful, I have a macbook pro, is there anyway to have something like those opening screens as a wallpaper, like an actually moving wallpaper?
Remind me of Hyper Light Drifter, pretty cool!
did you use game maker to make this game?

looks beautifull btw, congrats!
Been following this one for awhile. Looks great.
Is this already out? 
Ninja Gai Fieri
Wish this was coming to iOS. I have been scouring for a good mobile game.
The story of the blacksmith from Dark Souls.
I cant find this on the steam store?
Did he just punch that dude in the face?
Looks like the new god of war to me.
Wow. Great sprite work!
Reminds me of Sword & Sworcery
Is this released yet? If not, when?
Weeeeell, I'm extremely sold. This is exactly my type of game.
Could a game like this have been made on old consoles of the day? what prevents something like this from being made at that time?
Looks awesome. Is this a one man operation? If so.. Wow.
Finally a game where i can play as Ron Swanson.
Reminds me a bit of Superbrothers:S&S.
The graphic style looks almost identical to Crawl.
Magnus Burnside?
That is virtually unwatchable in full-screen
looks sweet, hope it gets an IOS port eventually
Probably my favorite move is the fact that you can punch a baddy straight up in the face. Those hanging corpses that are, but aren't in the tree... Spooky man. This oozes atmosphere. I'll be watching this!
This reminds me of samurai jack but with more gore
When can I play this
I can't find a release date / month / quarter for this. Does greenlit mean weeks, months, unknown? Any further release info?
I will never understand the appeal of tumblr nose.
Release date?
Bunyan... is that you?
Bombadillo simulator!
Looks fun, I hope it has enough gameplay features to not get boring
This graphic and fight style reminde me of [Not a Hero](http://store.steampowered.com/app/274270), hope it's as good.
This one's a keeper.
Reminds me of the Woodsman from Over the Garden Wall
How can i design that graphs? Which program?
Wow, just replace the main character and that' what I've always wanted from a Samurai Jack video game.
Wow this game is right up my street. Can't wait.
It looks kinda like Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery
Love those combat animations.  It seems so difficult to make characters physically interact like that.
Mmm i like it. I'll keep an eye on it
Looks a bit like Superbrothers: Sword and Sorcery
Made by the same people that made Kingdom I would assume. Great game to check out btw guys, looks exactly like this.
Looks like Guacamelee

Reminds me of the Scottish dude from Samurai Jack
That was very peaceful until it wasn't 
File under games the 3DS needs
Looks pretty cool!  Will it be on [GOG](http://www.gog.com)?
Now what if Knuckles had a spin-off like this where he's guarding the master emerald hmm.
[The Keeper](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/5/51/Keeper_App.png?version=015575ff6a80cb6fe5f9f7e3ffb02e46)
"I'm more of a chaser, really"
This looks so cool. How can I play this game? Is it online or can I download for my Mac? I'm totally out of touch with games these days, but love how it reminds me of my childhood with Sierra / LucasArts games. 
This reminded me of Kerrek (pat rothfuss's character from critical role).  that is all...
Reminds me of Shovel Knight a little. Definitely want to try this one out.
[So basically Bloodborne?](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/190668701391920329/190F31AF18A562426F1FB37BDEB0241A4B91ED15/)
*Andre
Looks awesome, congratulations. Could we get more enemy types though?
Reminds me of LISA
I'm guessing the game is called The Keeper? It looks fun :)
That's some decent looking pixel art. I might have to check this one out.
2 questions, whats the name of the game and who do I throw money to? and preferably can I just throw them to their face so I can get the game
This looks like it was made by the creators of [Hyper Light Drifter...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWufEJ1Ava0)
This reminds me of hyperlight drifter 
Looks awesome, posting so i don't forget about this one.
The style is beautiful, but I think the attack animations should come out much quicker. Delaying the action after the user inputs a button press can make combat feel a bit unresponsive.
Holy shit that's awesome
apparently he's keeping cans of whoop ass
I've felt like ive seen this same game for the last 5 years now.
*Sighs* Well... Time for another skyrim play-through 

I like how in the first scene that has lightning, you can see the silhouettes of people hanging from the tree in the background.
Is this on Steam?
Looks alot like kingdom, which I definitely recommend. 
wait!? Where can I play this game! I need this in my life!
Will this be on mobil?
Beautiful art direction!
as an alchemist on skyrim, I really want to catch those butterflies so I can make health potions.
I think I might get this game. So cute
The art style actually reminds me a lot of Hyper Light Drifter, just with less neon colors.
Looks a lot like hyper light drifter
Speaking as someone who has dabbled in spriting for years, SEXY.
Based on the gate keeper in Murakami's hardboiled wonderland??
All of these, just because a certain ninja stole his bait worms...
I was expecting something Binding Of Isaac related.
[TITAN!!!!!!!!!](http://imgur.com/a/1exMZ)
looks dope
I think it would also be great if you could play as those samurai as well.
Looks like the guy from Breath of Fire 3. The guy who sends you to kill a Nue in the mountains.
Is this the name of the game?
Me: oooooooooooohhhhhh

Wallet: NNNOOOOOOOOOOOO
Is this done by the same group that did Crawl? 
Reminds me of Momodora
iOS port please.
I can't find this game in the App Store. Which platform is it on?
*sigh* is it weird that I kinda want a path in this game to just be building up your little lumbermill, fishing, cooking, and doing chores?
Is there a release date?
The Art that people have put into pixels to this day is beyond my imagination. I don't think I haven't been enticed to buy a AAA game in years. The creativity and thought that goes into the games from indie developers far exceeds that of the big industries pumping out game after game of the same thing. Happy to be a PC player.
Looks great
Same creators as Hyper Light Drifter? It has a very similar look and feel.
Get you a man that can do both.
Looks awesome
Wow this feels like I'm looking at Kvothe modern day.
How do you make something like this? 
Does this remind anyone else of that short film or episode (can't remember) where a man is tasked with keeping a lantern lit?? I can't remember what it was, but it has that same vibe imo.
All I want to know is can I fish and will said fishing be awesome? 
This is what Vesemir does around Kaer Morhen when the other Witchers are travelling.
Subscribed!
This talks to me on so many levels, the aesthetic, the protagonist, the combat. Looking very forward to seeing it progress!
So wait, what platform is this on? And is it already out?
This reminds me of Shovel Knight
Oh look, *another* side scroller game, how hip and new....
God i would love to get my hands on this game to do a look at it, it looks so cool!
all these pixel games use the same animation style. It was even discussed here not too long ago, with examples given how to accomplish that quick anime'ish style of attack. Basically a really low frame rate style with key frames integrating certain flashy stills to complete the animation and make it look fast and deliver impact. But it's all the same now, everyone is doing it and abusing it. Not every cartooney fighting game like this has to employ the exact same style. There are a few indie games on steam that use smooth animations and look fantastic and original. 
I am not a fan of retro games at all, but this looks amazing. I think the art style is really well executed. It would be cool if we could build something in the game. Other than that, I love the fact that it will be available on linux.
This looks like it would be a dope IOS game
I actually love survival games and I'll be sure to track this! Thats why im leaving comment. Ty!
Ahhh, I think I'll just add the survival mod to skyrim...
Otaku Truck Driver?
I'm a little tired of Pixel games at this point, I know I can't be alone in this. Is it just cheaper to make sprite art?
This looks good, but I'm getting tired of pixel art graphics. It's just too prevalent nowadays.
What is the name of it?
Reminds me of Star bound.
Neckbeard simulator. Or at least how they view themselves.
Game?
What game is this?
Every veteran Binding of Isaac: Rebirth player just got PTSD flashbacks.

(*Fuck The Keeper.*)
Why is reddit so into 8bit shit?

Another lo-fi, retro pixel game. YEY.

Graphics looks shite, gameplay needs to be something extra.
I wish people could make games with better graphics.  I know it's fun to circlejerk over "muh nostalgia pixels 16-bit vaporwave hurr durr" but it's 2016, there is no other reason to make a game look like this than the above-mentioned circular jerkery.  If you can't do art then hire someone who can and charge $3 more for your game to cover their salary.
Wait what? Why this ad upvoted so much? 
[deleted]
Is this looking like Ron Swanson Simulator to anyone else?
That went from 0 to 100 real quick. Awesome!
So it's basically Lisa...
So...this is an ad for your game?
Does this not look exactly like Rogue Legacy?
This season of HarmonQuest looks good.
Looks like swordigo
Dan Harmon is finally getting his own game?
Remind me! 10 minutes.
Looks really good!
Add in blood effects when he's doing these cool moves and finishers and stuff. Doesn't have to be crazy absurd levels of blood, just add an effect to it somehow. 
RemindMe! 5 pm
Do want 
I would like it better if it weren't pixel art. I like the style I just wish it had more of a hand drawn ascetic. 
Remind Me! 10 days
bump
Qvothe?
How can i pay them money to make this?
Welp. Im sold.
Anyone else getting the vibe that Ron Swanson is the main character?
it's cool because it's pixel art
Oh wow! 
So it's Kingdom?
Looks like Dan Harmon's character on HarmonQuest
RemindMe!
Solid
Pixellated action-adventure indie game with deep themes and goofy characters: 2016

I want it.
Ron freakin Swanson. 
RemindMe! 1 year! 
What is this? I must have it!
YES PLEASE.
Any clue when this will be out? or is this just flirting with a concept?  Ive watched the trailer a bunch of times and now just want to play it!!! 
Maybe it's just because I've played TW3 so much, but my first thought was that this seemed like a Witcher platformer.
[deleted]
What game?
[removed]
You know, we make these pixel games out of a misplaced since of nostalgia because back then when we had pixilated games it was on the older TV models that's weren't high Def, so nothing looked that pixilated 
Ripoff of a ripoff with a tired, stolen style. Blatant self promotion. Yep, typical /r/gaming marketing spam. 
Awww look at that little tree fiddy
So... Where and how?
Pfft Polygon, if their Doom playthrough is anything to go by then they are still stuck on the 1st level.
Congrats! Looks more like a little Laparas to me though.
Many Bothans died to bring us this update.
Congratulations, Windows Update Complete!

Changes: TIE.exe has crashed. 
Woah woah woah..... Battlefront added space battles?
Windows 10 is the shortest way to the dark side.
I have W10 and never have these kinda issues. It only updates when i shut the pc down
Good thing I'm still on Windows 7.
imagine if the firmware of Luke's x-wing tried to auto-update while he was doing his trench-run.
What game is this?
When the reposts kick in.
So that's what brought down the Empire...
In tonight's reenactment of the destruction of the Death Star, the role of the Millennium Falcon will be played by Window's Updates.
And so the Empire was never defeated and the last Jedi has finally died!
Updates available  
  
                                    [Get fucked]

Yeah, fuck Windows 10 and Origin.
TIL people still play this on PC
My PC kept interrupting my Dark Souls game. Of course I just exited out of them and ignored them and then five minutes later I'm down to one humanity phantom and then...My PC starts rebooting and installing updates. As the PC updates I can hear my guy getting hit and eventually dying...

Automatic updates are the spawn of hell.
LMAO Who could've guessed going from 8 to 10 was a downgrade
How can people not know how to get around this? All you have to do is buy Windows 10 Platinum ($344), run hackmywindows10.exe, boot into ultrasafe mode, divide system32 into 64 parts, and run this simple code:

> 
 public class update {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "windows 10 is best" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("ayyy lmao");
    }

It basically works out of the box, win10 best windows eva...

Satya Nadella really knows what he's doing.
Something like this happened to me but in dead space. 
"Got a problem here-"
I thought windows 10 had the ability for a game to inform the OS that it shouldn't be interrupted for things like this? 
This happened to me, for whatever reason I was never able to update Windows 10 since I downloaded it the day it came out, then one day me and my friends were playing Zombie Army Trilogy, right at the boss fight I get and update notification that I cant decline or delay. Over a year of updates and 3-5 hours later I get back on, at least they killed the boss...
At least it's not as bad as Overwatch ending the competitive season mid match with a giant pop up.
Fix this problem by setting your network as "metered" in the settings.
this shit is why PCs haven't crushed consoles yet.
Am I the only Windows 10 user who has never had this happen
This conviced me to stay to Windows 7 for ever
You can turn it off, you know that right?
So glad I kept with Windows 8.1 with updates off.
Windows doing you a favour there.
I see this far too much, its like people don't know you can just turn it off, or at least make it less intrusive.
This is a video of gameplay and then the guy set his timer for an update. You can see the video files when it comes from full screen. ✅
That's what happened when you don't bother to turn auto updates off.
I can tell you don't know what you're doing, because you don't even have VLC installed to take care of videos.
Serves you right for using a junk OS.
That looks so uncomfortable to play on...


I want 5
This is one of those rocket slimes?
I've never seen this before! Awesome!
Wow you actually bought it? I know everyone had one of those weird ass controllers that your friends got stuck with when they came over but I dont think anyone ever recalls buying them lol. They just kind of appear.
I have one of those too, but the inconsitent temperature in my closet caused the rubbery finish to attract dust like a magnet and when I cleaned it off it lost the finish too.
Player 2
Really, REALLY cool thing. Sucktastic design.
Your controller is a little slimey.
You guys keep saying dragon quest but all i see is the lvl1 slime from Dragon Warrior series. One of the best!! Thanks for the memories!
Wow. Cool. Unique design. Wanna play with it.
I remember when Game Crazy was still around, I apparently won one of those controllers through some program they had. I just got it in the mail one day and was super confused.
Egonomically designed for a cat?
That Hershey's Kiss has toggle nuts!
Had no idea Dragon "Warrior" is still a thing. Guess I've been sleeping on this one.
I held one of these once. It wasn't comfortable.
I remember seeing there was a little ordering card for this controller that came in the disc case for DQVIII. I regret getting one, that game is one of my favorite games and I was obsessed.
Is this basically a ds3
This, the RE4 chainsaw controller and the GameCube keyboard controller are those ones that people always go "dafuq?" when you bust them out.
Ah love this controller. I bought a few, and kept two sealed. Here's a picture of them still in the packaging. :)
http://imgur.com/a/qiQ8p
Man, I just found mine in storage about a week ago. Still in the box and everything. 
At first glance, i thought it was a solid blue Chao from 'Sonic Adventure 2'... i don't think i ever finished that game because of those Chaos. haha
Still a better design than the PS3 controller 
That's awesome, I'm jelly!!! Or slimey...
is that buttplug?
If I had one ofthese, it would end up in my butt,and me in the ER.
I'll give you $8
A blue slime? Pretty cool, but very common :) 
Not as bad as the chainsaw controller they released for RE4
*too lazy to find and post picture 
That is the most amazing thing I have ever seen!
why does that butt plug have joy sticks?
Dafuq?

What's the name of the game FFS.
I thought he fixed pipes, not balls.
Technically they did. Dogfighting in WWI is nothing like the dogfighting in WWII. In WWII they were proper areal dogfights by doing maneuvers to get behind the enemy airplanes and shoot them out with their mountain machine guns in spectacular fashion, and when someone dominated the skies they certain had a tactical advantage by providing support to ground troops. In WWI dogfights became well known with soldiers and the public through stories of the Red Baron or watching the battles unfold above them in the sky from the trenches.


The earlier days of dogfighting were much messier though as areal combat like that hadn't really been tested before. In the early days of the war biplanes were used more for reconnaissance missions to quickly get in and out of enemy territory. Before the advent of more sophisticated aircraft, when engaging the enemy either in the air or on the ground the biplane pilots would have to get creative. Throwing bricks, grenades, and gas bombs were the most popular method against ground troops as they had a better chance of hitting the enemy than the alternative.


Early biplanes were used for reconnaissance remember, and thus were not armed to the teeth yet. At most the pilots would have to bring along small firearm with them to aim and fire manually while flying, or most of the time have the copilot do the aiming and shooting. Aiming your gun up in the sky is rather difficult. High speed winds, the unpredictable movements of the enemy biplane, and sometimes the wobbliness of your own biplane made shooting hand held weapony difficult. So rather than waste bullets, most dogfights consisted of enemy aircraft throwing bricks, ***grenades***, and even rope at enemy biplanes to bring them down. Bricks were cheap to get, grenades had a wide area of effect, and rope was really good at stalling enemy propellers.


As the war marched on biplane technology became more sophisticated with front mountain machine guns that would fire in between propeller rotary spins, copilot mounted swivel guns, and biplanes specifically designed to drop bombs. However spectacular they were however, dogfights never really changed the course of The Great War in the long run. It wasn't until WWII did aircraft finally play a crucial role on the battlefield thanks in part due to the technological advancements by the end of WWI leading up into WWII.
Someone is probably going to wonder how I managed to get dynamite as a pilot. I landed the plane near the spawn and had to redeploy. The good thing about this however, is that it means that you don't see people in game doing this sort of stuff like in BF4 where it wasn't uncommon for someone to jump out of their jet and try to do a [rendezook.] (https://gfycat.com/PessimisticSmugCoypu) So for those who disliked seeing others jumping out of jets etc, that won't be an issue for you in BF1.

Long version of the video [here.] (https://youtu.be/KXQCG_KDopI)
World War 1 had better fps
Yeah they did this
Okay, I haven't played BF1, but I don't think they had remote detonated bombs in the 1910s. What's going on here?
Why the repost in 24/48hrs?!
Great, people figuring out how to make BF1 as fucking stupid as BF4 was with all the retarded trick shots. 
Omg 😂
It is exactly stuff like this that has kept me from buying a Battlefield game at all.  I'll stick to my Rise of Flight, DCS & ArmA III, but it was neat if you like this.

How did your left wing repair after getting back in the cockpit?
As a longtime battlefield fan its gif's like this that justify me skipping this one with no regrets. 
My asshole tightened so fast it whistled
I really wish Valve would make a third Left 4 Dead. Too bad they won't count to three.
Oh the memories...  I can hear the entire room of them beginning to scream in my mind.  
A BFG would come in handy at that moment.
What game is this and is it worth buying?
Don't Dead. Open Inside.
he he like the way the kill looked simple enough
Doomguy would be helpful here.
That's some deer-eating-horde-of-I-AM-LEGEND stuff right there. Screw that.
I just said out loud "(laughing) ahh the good ole days of dicking your friends over and hiding in the.... Oh no.... "

Miss this game, servers are dead though.
Wow this bring back some great memories. I played VS mode like a freak. Logged some ridiculous hours.  
Why were there so many witches in the safe house? How does that happen?
This is what I deserved every time I shot a teammate down at the end of a level and closed them out of the safehouse.
My overall enjoyment of this game went down by quite a bit once i realized the best way to deal with the witch is to just oneshot her :/
I really really wish that game stayed as good as it was at launch.
R/gifsthatendtoosoon
It was at this moment that he knew. He f$@$;@ up.
eep!
It never seems to be that easy for me and that is a lot of witches 
Its just a Beliebers convention.
Oh boy! Never seen this one before!
Omg. I was rooting for the guy, then.....I noped the fuck out.  
I would if so thrown a Molotov in and closed the door locking them in.
Oh look! A whole room full of nopes!
My repost sense is tingling.
/r/Unexpected is calling.
That might be one of the most horrifying things I've ever seen in gaming.
This is college
You aren't supposed to take the title of the game so literally.
Watchdogs 2 is the first game in the series to feature dogs.

The first Watchdogs just has cats and pussies.
It is a random dialogue generator, it can happen when stop for one dog pet..

sick game, haven't been able to play anything else!!
Reminds me of Dungeon Keeper 2.  At 1 or 2 am local time, the announcer would say "Surely even Dungeon Keepers must retire to a lair of some description?"

If you stayed on the pause screen too long, he'd taunt "The very rock yawns with anticipation of your next *fascinating* move."

Miss that game.
Is it any good? 
When I saw the main character was black I just realized it was watch dogs 2 that was released and not sleeping dogs 2. This makes me pretty sad.
but you're just doing what the title of the game says
It's called Watch Dogs after all...
Is the dog talking to me?
Within 10 minutes of getting my first video game my mom said the same thing.
Played the little intro mission last night before I watched the football... can't wait to get home from work and play tonight!! 
What a passive aggressive game.
No you don't.
Reminds me of that time I got my ass chewed off by my commanding officer for shooting rats and crows when I was suppose to stop a nuclear launch.
My young mind never experienced such a change of tone in such a serious and cinematic game before, it was one of the longest laughing fit in my life.
"Havent you got better things to do?

Dont you have someone to kill?"
Priorities :D
Lesser dog?
Being able to do stuff like that is my distinction between good and bad sandboxes.
The second Watch Dogs is already out? I either succeeded in avoiding all advertisements or they didn't have any.
Age you playing on a potatoe? 
Can I change my characters appearance before the game?
What platform is this on? The graphics look worse than the first one.
"optimized using novideo gimpworks technology"
Yeah I also have to freeze and swap into a skeletal frame before plummeting dead to the ground.
Good shot plane and simple. 
Oh look, someone got into a tank and didn't shove it straight up the tunnel at Charlie to fight the enemy tanks shoved straight up the tunnel at Charlie to fight our tanks shoved straight up the tunnel at Charlie....

:grumble grumble:
Yesterday I shot a plane out of the sky during conquest, so I was sitting on a point, I hear a faint screaming and 10 seconds later the body lands by my feet. It was the pilot. I love this game
There's a body rolling down the hill at the start of this gif lol.
It really bothers me that in a AAA title in 2016 we still have super broken animations/physics for vehicles taking damage. If you're a dev please take the time to get it right, it makes a world of difference for players who want to feel immersed in the game. Not to mention that in many cases it has an effect on the gameplay if the hitboxes behave the same way.
I've yet to be successful to kill the heavy tank as a soldier. If I see one I just run. 
It's almost as if the game has to say "Holy shit, did that tank just shoot the plane out of the sky?  It did!?  Damn...nice shot *plane crashes*
Never thought I'd see a plane shed its skin like that. Such a rare sight in mother nature.
Off-topic, but this nicely illustrates one of my pet peeves with BF1 - the tanks are just way too mobile. The fastest tank in WWI had a top speed around 8-10 MPH, and most were under 5 MPH. They could maybe crawl up the slope pictured at <1 mph, but in general they are just way too mobile. 

I know, just another of the things they did for gameplay over realism, but it seems like if they weren't going to do *anything* even semi-accurately, they shouldn't have set the game in the time period they chose. Call it Battlefield 1939 and it wouldn't be so ridiculously anachronistic.
I cant do that! I am jealous
Love the little backup at the end of the gif, almost as in surprise.
Nice
You killed it so hard it left its corpse behind.
I helped make a headhunter mod for the original unreal tournament. 
There was a bug where two severed heads would pop into existence at the same time. One of them you could pick up (the object of the game was to collect heads) but the other would just stay hanging in mid air. After a while the level was filled with floating severed heads.
Wow, I feel like I should just camp up there with one of those with how often bomber fly over those trenches
Is there any advantage to using the shotgun or whatever variant that is to the tank shell?
*Couscous the food so nice they named it twice*
Such jraphics!
I played that map last night for the first time. I love using the large cannons on the far side of the map, shot down a bunch of planes with it and hit unsuspecting enemies who stood too close to the cannon.
I try & try to do this, but fail every time :(
Sublime boss dj
Lol his name is Momgetthegopro
It's called lag hacks, notice when the plane on the left gets hit and dies by another player it doesn't do the "skeletal" animation. BUSTED Reported to origin.
I hit a bomber with a trench gun the other day.
Looks like Orochimaru got his piloting license.
It looks like the airplanes' souls are coming out when you kill them...
What game is this?  Sorry I'm a gamer idiot, but I just got back into gaming after a break for several years while I raised my tiny humans (they leave little time for gaming).  Currently playing Skyrim 10 years too late , so I don't want to miss out on the best games out now.  I'd love other suggestions for great games to if anybody has time.
cous cous, the food so nice they named it twice
Fun fact kids: when a plane gets shot down, it immediately sheds its damaged layer for a new protective layer 
When The Ancient One shoots planes.
Hi OP is this me on the plane? Did this happen yesterday? Someone shot my plane down with a tank in the same place. 
I hear everyone talking about this glitch with the planes and honestly I just want to say I got a PS4 Pro last Tuesday and Battlefield 1 runs a lot smoother on it than it does on my roommates 980ti/htpc/watercooled pc. Honest. I've never seen any kind of glitching like this before on it
That's some crap animation right there. Planes double themselves upon explosion?
Neat. Just like donald trump winning the elections twice, second time feels just as good.
As a pilot this triggers my PTSD, please add a trigger warning so that others won't have to go through what I did. FeelsBadMan
This game looks like crap...
What a groovy guy.
Watch out for that cow!

The biggest mistake is probably G2A
I mean, both my girlfriend and my mother enjoy playing videogames where they plant gardens...
From a business point, I will never understand why a company would still take the risk of a shitstorm by doing these "for him, for her" kind of ads, especially on the internet...


Maybe if it was Stardew Valley. For some reason I imagine Farming Simulator to have a much more balanced demographic.

Then again, games with a balanced demographic might be the "for her" categories, as I suspect the others have a much more skewed demographic.
The internet always makes me wonder if im born with the wrong gender.
I've never played it but I'm always impressed when I see stats on steam of most users online etc that Farming Simulator is nigh always really high up, like top 10, usually above a lot of AAA games.
Well it's what I learned from facebook games was farmville request use to come from mostly female friends.
well, nothing hotter than a farmer girl.
Why would anyone, regardless of gender, want to play aa farming simulator? Why not, you know, go outside and plant a garden? It's fun  and you get actual food to eat in the end.
This makes me sad and angry.

It is sexist and unfair.

One of the reasons I loved Bad Company 2.
By golly, you're right! Video games *don't* follow the same rules as the real world. What an astonishing and original insight.
Look there are 2 ways to deal with a fire. Firstly if say your couch is on fire you want to take the cushions and put them in other parts of the house. This spreads the fire out and causes it to cool down and go out (firefighters hate this trick). The second way is if you have something that can make a hotter fire. Then Heisenberg's Imflammatory Principle cause your very hot flame to cancel out the other cooler fire, plus in the presence of metal it acts like a welding gun, thereby repairing the armour of your tank.

Hello DAVE
That controller looks like the sharp nes controller, which is pretty rare. Nintendo and Sharp put out a nes/tv combo(a nes built into a tv) and it had a controller like that. 
I've come to save Hyrule again...
To be fair, that is a rare model of the NES controller:

Would have been smart to have done this PRIOR to Black Friday/Cyber Monday IMO but what the hell do I know?

Game's super fun, been playing for awhile and I'm hoping this will up the player base and get some of my friends playing.
How heavy is the game? May need to make space
Sweet! PC only or console as well?
I will definitely be playing. Gonna recruit my gaming group too. 
Nice one Respawn! This should definitely help the population increase now people have a chance to get it if they're on the fence still 
What OP failed to mention in the title:

 Titanfall 2 will host a free trial of the game's full multiplayer offering. The trial* will begin for EA Access and Origin Access members on November 30th, and become available for all players starting December 2nd on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Origin for PC. This will feature a full offering including all maps, modes, weapons and more including brand new content from Angel City’s Most Wanted DLC on December 3rd. 

DO IT!
OH

MY

GOD!

Fuck yes! I've been on the fence about this game, but i really want to try it first! Fuck yes! I'm so excited!
Damn. I might have to buy the game just to support all the good the devs are doing.

Good job Respawn. These are the kinds of stunts (all free DLC, free weekends, price cuts) that make me continue to love video games.
Wow so ge- ............................I fucking sold my graphics card because I complained I don't play games anymore.

Kill me
Play. This. Game.
Does anyone know if you'll be able to pre-download before the weekend? With my internet, it'll take the weekend just to download the game.
how do i install the game before December 2nd?
Haha finals week. Thanks EA.
Can't say enough good things, favorite shooter in years, certainly since the prime time of COD. Hope everyone gives it a try. 
I am going to try, but for anyone already playing, the hud clutter drives me nuts, is there a way to turn it off or reduce it? also the mech's window and weapons, can they be turned off?

If anyone is wondering why, I play ut4 (and every version) with almost no hud even weapon is turned off so to go to a game with so much happening on screen is disorienting
Time to see if my little 650ti can handle this. I've heard it's well optimized but it is a pretty shit card.
So, from December 2nd to 4th? what times?
Neat!

Too bad I just got Overwatch due to its free weekend like, a week ago.
Fuck yeah, now maybe some of you will hop on!
This is great. I've felt that this game seemed too CODish (the newer CODs) for my taste. Now I'll get to actually get my hands on it and truly decide without having to buy it (yet!).
This is awesome- taking a page out of the Overwatch book, I see. Will definitely try it out!
**Umm, how exactly do you download it on PC? I went to EA Origin and can't find the free trial anywhere. Free Trials, Game Library, Titanfall 2 Store Page, can't find it anywhere.**

Edit: Nov 30 is only for those with EA Origin Access. I don't, so I'll have to wait until Dec 2.
If you played the first one and liked the mechanics and gameplay but wished it had a little more variety; Titanfall 2 is for you. 
They desperately need customers it seems, it's been month since release and they already make free MP weekends, not that I complain... it just shows how bad this game sold because of shit release date / no interest thanks to TF1.
Fuck this weekend. Some of us have finals and projects to do. Dammit guys.
get my 1070 tomorrow so this will be perfect timing for me. waka waka
I picked a GREAT weekend to go visit my mom. 
Man it's going to be such an awesome slaughter fest :D

That game is actually different than other shooters, people will get mowed down all day long :)
sweet definitely gonna check this out.
Goddammit my gaming laptop's in the shop!
And I was interested in this game, too!
So many free weekends. I can't wait to feel buyers remorse at having bought Overwatch instead of this.
Hoo boy! The N00b Harvest came in early this year!
Neat, that looks like a really fun...never mind, it needs Origin.
would have been smart for respawn to let us get our origin access perks with titanfall 2.. respawn be like,,,, nah screw that, we'll charge full price for 2 weeks and then when nobody buys our game, we'll sell it for half price and do free weekends..
>In Respawn’s single player debut, the team has elevated the first-person shooter genre by bringing fresh ideas, clever design elements and innovation to the carefully crafted story campaign.

Pfffft, talk about fucking masturbation.

It's pretty good, but I wouldn't say their campaign elevates the genre or that it's a "carefully crafted story campaign."  There *are* lots of "clever design elements," and it's a very competent campaign but the plot is utterly bland, and the main deuteragonists are hardly brand new, either.

People will beat their dicks bloody over the "Effect and Cause" campaign mission, but it's not *that* special.  It's absolutely clever and interesting, but hardly worth getting so worked up over.

Hello Games provided the ASA 4 hours of footage to look at. Could potentially have been picked carefully.
I see some NMS fans already been here by the way valid questions getting downvoted.

Granted, the recent update added a lot to the gameplay, BUT, even with the update **it's still not the game that've been advertised**, so it does make me scratch my head 'bout the ruling of "UK authority"
This really makes me question what their definition of false advertising is.

It's like promising a cheese burger, but then there's no cheese and you react with "it's still a burger".
Bull. Shit.
WHAT ABOUT THE MULTIPLAYER!!! SEAN SAID IT DID HAVE
Frivolous lawsuit because the internet exists. You can easily look up game play footage and there are numerous critics rushing for day 1 releases. It's not the courts job to police your day 1 release and everyone else should've known better. For the record i knew it would end exactly like this otherwise you could sue every DVD only release movie that has a cinematic cover.

Likewise any cash you throw at a Kickstarter is gone forever no matter what they churn out - if anything.

You guys want good Proc. Gen. try Bloodborne it is the best at what it does stop wasting your time on Darkest Dungeon.
I am someone who played the game at launch for about 30 hrs, trying my best to give it a fair shot. But like you all know the game was terrible. The new update actually did something I never thought would be possible. It actually turned a tech demo into an actual game. I'm talking about survival mode here. It's actually hard now and they have found a good balance with material gathering and rarity. The game is actually fun now. HOWEVER there are many things shown on the steam page that are simply just not in the game. I'm enjoying the game, but this decision still feels really strange to me. NMS misled the public like no other game I have ever seen. If they can get away with what they did on launch than I think there isn't much hope left for keeping devs honest about game advertisement.
How?
Still a shite game 
Ya know what... whoever is responsible for making No Man's Sky trailers... give him a medal, he's GREAT. I never bought the game but I LOVE watching the trailers and am still tempted to buy the game EVERY time... because there's still hope that it's just like the trailers.
Lies.... more lies..

What's arena mode?
Those bloody eagles got me every time.
So the devs are in touch with reality? Cool!
In retrospect, should have let the elephants do it.  Honey badger was a mistake.
Dude, those things are SAVAGE. They steal honey by just walking in there and having too thick skin to get stung. When a Lion sees a honeybadger, he runs the fck away, because the lil' guy just goes for the lion's balls. Stay the hell away from honeybadgers.

To be fair, no one buys a Bethesda game expecting it to work properly.
I got it for free on steam so I'm not complaining
Well no where did they say remastered meant bug fixes.
If only you waited a few days for the flash sale.. it was half off.

"The bloodiest beef in the Reach."
This reminds me of the Russian meat market where a Russian couple were selling the bodyparts of their children.
why would you do that?
The mods are free.... And look 100 x better.
What is a Bethesda game without its bugs tho...
I didn't pay for it. It showed up in my Steam library, so I mean...
Im glad I waited until Cyber Monday to get it for $25
I was honestly surprised when I saw the quality of the remastered version.
It has worse graphics and visuals than standalone mods five years ago, it managed to break a lot more things, it made a lot of previous mods incompatible, had worse sound and absolutely zero gameplay improvement whatsoever.

and all for the low low price of 60 American dollars!

What suckers Bethesda must think we all are.
If you pay 60 dollars for something that you could have gotten for free on the PC its your own damn fault.

I wanted to see them kill the chicken
I'm curious. What'd happen If they shot the chicken?
Haha :D Oh Mein Gott, I wouldn't never have thinked about this. 
I expected someone to just stab the chicken

How'd the terrorists win if the counter terrorists defused the chicken? 
You're everything that's wrong with today's world.

Sometimes I wish I was this kind of gamer. Actually read the lore and took time to discover things like this. It's probably a pretty good feeling when you do.
"It's the little things" like this image, with text too small to read. Top post.
I remember my first time through this area.  There was quite the story being told in the journals and visuals.  I was, and remain, very impressed.  
This was a great little back story for the dungeon. It was really impressive how there are lots of little tragic stories hidden around Skyrim if you look around a bit.
You got any more of them pixels?
Here is an Imgur version that I exported at a larger resolution if that helps with the many people who can't read it. I know the resolution isnt optimal. Thats just something I will have to be more aware of in the future.

http://imgur.com/a/JdZEl
This was incredibly difficult to read.
This dungeon was nicely fleshed out.  Wish more of the Non-story dungeons had more things like this. If I recall theirs a few more parts of this story as well, such as the dead Women who iirc literally threw the unfortunate fellow at the end of this image to safety before getting filled with arrows.
Why its the best game
I felt this way about getting the Freefall Leg Armor in Fallout 4. Kinda depressing reading the guy's entries on his computer about having no elevator that goes up to his level, creates these awesome boots so he can just jump to the bottom, locks boots in safe as the nuclear war begins, just drinks nuka cola to death in his office at the top of Mass Fusion, then realizing that there's hella empty nuka bottles surrounding his skeletal corpse. Mind blown with sadness.
and then these little things 

'you oughta check out the college '

*wearing winterhold archmage outfit*
This is what a good RPG should have. Reminds me when older games used to rely on these story elements to compensate for the lack of graphics. 
Can't see shit.
I can tell what's going on in about half of these. The other half, I can't see anything 
ok thats not a little thing, thats a pretty big setup actually!
I love the detail orientation in this game. It's definitely one I am not putting down anytime soon!
What is this, writing for ants!?
Never forget, "The Lusty Argonian Maid", or its sequel of course.
Wow what are the chances that I just did this dungeon like 12 hours ago... anyway yea there's actually a book that describes a whole party of people, and slowly you find them throughout the dungeon all the way to the very end. And a few have journals telling where the others might be. Super well done -- and if I hadn't read the starting journal outside of the entrance I would have missed it all!
This really leads me to wonder how much is "hidden" in plain sight in the books you pick up. Like, if you took the time to read them all, all the boring ones, would you start picking up on more and more little details? 
Shucks, I'm guilty of not spending enough/much time reading the stuff in Skyrim.
^^^^How ^^^^am ^^^^i ^^^^supposed ^^^^to ^^^^read ^^^^that ^^^^?
I love this stuff in games but NEVER have the patience to read everything. 
There's so many examples of immersion building stuff like this in Skyrim. Meeko <3
Is this an inventory mod? 
What dungeon?
tiny pictures are tiny..

hard to read, do not want!
I just started playing it and I like it, but I guess I really need to take the time and read all these damn books...

at least in Fallout the terminals weren't too "read-ey"
Is stuff like this in Fallout 4 or did I just miss everything interesting
That's one of the things I love about Skyrim. There's all sorts of little stories and bits of lore to pick up on, and it really gives the world a lot of life. 
I can't read a thing in that image, so I have no idea what point your trying to make.
There's a quest in a castle, of a family that was killed by falmors that live in a cave underground their home. The journal of the boy combined with what you see is heartbreaking. The little things like he says his sister was hearing things n always hid beneath the bed (n there rest her body) and boy also says he don't like Skyrim cause is too cold (they came from hammerfell) and he discribes their lives, till the point they got all slaughtered
I'm doing this quest right now, I hate Dwemer ruins in general cause Falmer are annoying to fight in numbers and the automatons are annoying too. Plus the constant clanking and machinery sound gets grating after a bit. I play on PC with some good sound mods so that's partially my fault on the sound part cause I hear everything lol. 

That said I felt bad for the Khajiit brothers, and felt even worse putting one down. The lower you go into the dungeon the worse it gets, you also find every single one of the expedition members down there which was an interesting side Story to the dungeon cause you're there for one item that's tied to the main quest. 
This is funny to see today, as I was just playing this area last night.
i only read the journals and diaries; plus the occasional book, given an interesting title. I have a chest full of books i've never read, sitting within Breezehome -- i tell myself i'm going to go back and read them all, but there are SO MANY. I get overwhelmed by the thought of reading just one, as my focus is on grinding. 

What makes reading the little snippets of backstory worth it? Titles like "The Lusty Argonian Maid?"
I'd like to think they plot this all in writing, but my guess is that the devs build the scene and the writers describe it.
This game has some amazing storytelling if you want to put the time in to read.

Problem is, when I want to read a story, I go pick up a book. I never have the patience when I'm playing, I just wanna go stick my dagger in something else.
I remember stumbling across this when I was just running around aimlessly. It is one of the things about Skyrim that has always stuck with me. I had the game for 5 years before completing the story. That says a lot because the story only took me about a day to complete when I got around to it. Still wish the main story line was longer though.
Didn't even take the time to look what you posted, but since you put the game title in your post, you get an upvote!
I usually don't read the books, but always try to read journals and diaries kinda near corpses or inside dungeons in general. They're always worth a read!
I just keep coming back to this game. Agreed!
I vaguely notice this all the time, but never really think about it. I pretty much guarantee that I would have noticed it if it *wasn't* there though.
I love reading random journals, i remember finding a journal on a dead scholar in a tomb, on the end it said something like "theres a lever, must be for the locked door right?, wouldnt hurt to explore a bit". But boy he was wrong because that one lever shoot arrows which are the reason for his demise.
This is the best you can do when you recycle dungeons and revisit them over and over and over to fight new and unexciting Draughr
Scooma ^is^where^we^found^the^scooma^and^now^I^have^an^arrow^...
Things like Haelga's room in the Bunkhouse, complete with leather straps, honey, stamina potions and a horker tusk. Praise Dibella indeed.
how disappointing if none of the journals reflected what was going on in the world.
You know, I can't tell you how many times I've had a conversation about this games quality to people.

This post is an example of cherry picking to the extreme, a large majority of the dungeons in Skyrim are simply bland and boring so picking one single dungeon and claiming it to be "the little things" that make this game great is just nonsense. Sure the things in the book links with the environments story,but a great game that does not make. 

Of course, this is Skyrim on reddit so I'm already certain this will be downvoted to oblivion.

From time to time I binge on some half life mp and unreal tournament to relive my childhood. Some of the best times I have ever had in gaming. I miss the huge communities that both games had.

Lol the servers probably cost $20 a month to mantain
I wish Socom CA was still online

There will never be a better era of online gaming/modding than 1998-2008
That's nothing, DOOM '93 still has an active multiplayer, and DragonMUD goes back to '89.
it isnt about being good guy, its all about being good game.
Is the singlepayer still worth it?(from all hl games)
still some of my favorite  MP to play. the weapons, maps, and physics are amazing and not like any other game

I especially like the transit map where players can ride and fight over the rail car
I like icecream.
Bad guy Half-life
Leave the single player story at a cliffhanger and even though it is the most requested game in history never finish the story
Yeah because Valve needs to worry about servers 
so can starcraft
Technically, no you can't since the original game's MP worked through the WON gaming service which no longer works and now you need to play through Steam.

The Half-Life 1 we play now on Steam is different from the Half-Life from CDs back in 98.
They fucked up by adding HD models though, they suck and take like half of the screen in some cases.
I play a few games that are like 5-6 years old.  I'm interested to see if the big games of the last generation will continue online support for this long.
yeah when is the sequel release date?
Stop reminding me of the non-existence of HL3. This is the worst timeline.
The same can be said of most online enabled dreamcast games I know for sure Phantasy Star Online Has a server or two
So if you are gonna repost you can't even be bothered to write the correct amount of years?
Is there an online Valve game that HAS been shut down? I imagine they all play on the same servers just divvied up between their games.
DOOM was released 23 years ago and you can still play online
Warcraft 2 is like, 20 years old and you can still play it online.
Wouldn't it be "Good Guy Valve"?
How are there no comments mentioning Black Mesa here? I bought it on Steam and even though it's not all the way complete, and crashes from time to time, the actual gameplay and art is absolutely on par with Half Life 2. If you can afford to support their efforts, and you have the ability to deal with some glitches, you should get it. And if the second part doesn't apply, you should wait a year. And then get it.

it is the year 2020.
the ape takeover happened a mere five years ago.

we are living in an Armageddon, a nightmare, a tortured life.
The apes rule over us, and we are forced to perform one singular act. If we do not, we are punished, by being shot.

Every time a gorilla approaches, we must unzip our pants, and pull out our dicks, and utter these words that have brought us such despair
"dicks out for harambe".
But apes already ruled the world.....they are called humans.
So if Harambe was shot and killed, and yet he came back to create the planet of the apes, does that make Harambe Gorilla-Jesus?
It's time to stop beating a dead gorilla

My god, the fact people are still referencing harambe months after the joke has died and has been beaten like a dead horse is honestly disturbing. 
We are intelligent apes.
I CANT BEAT THIS LEVEL! I'm starting to think creating real super intelligent apes might be easier!
Anyone play this on PC? I know Steam has had some decent deals on it. I wouldn't mind playing it again. 

I remember seeing a screenshot I took making fun of my friend: "Sergio has not been noticed" lol
i could never figure out how to win the apes scenario in this game.
what game is that?
That game is awesome!

Took me a long time to do the Ape one.
The apes part is hard but I personally think zombies is harder, the cure comes about too quickly (in the hardest difficulty)
Don't kill me for asking this, but what game is that. It looks really interesting and well thought out. 
And since apes don't wear pants... dicks are out 24/7
Whoa. This game has certainly changed a lot since I last played it.
I played that on the PC version yeeears and recently picked this up on android, I might just pay that 1-2$ to get that premium content. START 👏  IN 👏  MAD 👏 A 👏 GAS 👏 CAR 👏

This FPS gave me cancer.
For some reason I thought the controls were shit on this game (and yes, I was using a game-pad).
The premise is cool, the ski is awesome, the snowboard sucks hair balls on a summer night (never mind that shit jump mechanic) and paragliding was... meh. I was able to do a spin, yay.

The game is awesome, though, dont get me wrong. It just didn't click for me.

It fixed multiplayer bugs. I remember getting on IVs mp one year after Vs release and I was surprised to see a bunch of people still playing. At some point I joined a full session (17 players). The only thing I didn't like was that in pretty much every session there were modders who would spawn dicks and giant trees on you and would even freeze your console. There was also a bunch of KSA players playing.

Was advertised as a free PS4 game ( don't know if it was Japan only but looked amazing) dungeon dark soul ish; hopefully it comes out

Edit: also 4 player coop 
ZA WARUDO?!
what is this?
Is there ANY Information on this sasquatch of a game? I was so hyped for it when PS4 was ANNOUNCED.. 3 (or is it 4 now?) years into the cycle and this game has barely been whispered about..
Was this that F2P game that looked awesome in cinematic form but awkward when you saw the actual gameplay?
Cool, they're printing gifs on cereal box holograms now. 
I believe Capcom have until Feb 2017 to release it, or lose they lose the trademark for it.  Was a good idea, F2P, time traveling into artifacts.  It would be a shame if this game meets the same fate as P.T
I remember the trailer for this game when PS4 first announced, still nothing has materialized. Shame because it looked amazing.
Destroy All Humans had this 
This game still exists!?!?
But what's the secret of Dio's stand?!
looks like someone used the freezing time spell on the developers, Hiyooooo!
Supposedly it will be revealed finally at PSX, and capcom extended the trademark back in February of this year 
looks good to me. Been thinking of getting a PS4 as my next gen for bloodbourne and others and this has been added to the list, hopefully it comes out along with P.T.
There's speculation that it will release February 2017, but thats it as far as speculation/rumors go.
This reminds me of the time-stopping spell in the old DOS game, Catacomb 3-D.
So like, does this game still exist?
Man I had almost forgotten about this one. This was one of those I could remember in my head but didn't know enough to search for it. Shit is the worst.
Really want this to come out, I feel like we need more slow paced action games nowadays. 
Shut up and take my money!
And here I was, thinking this was an update.
Can't wait till this releases on ps6
Yeah... that's not how it's going to look I bet.
LOL IS THIS THE MANNEQUIN CHALLENGE!???
Holy shit. I remember deep down.
Let's see, if I squint hard enough...oh wow, that's awesome!
Why did you have to show me this, just another game for me to be what if about ! 
What the fuck happened to this game?
I had a trainer that has this tied to a key for Halo 1.

If you try to find it now it'll probably be on an ad-redden website.
This game isn't coming out. Move along.
It's pretty sad really, you'd think time stop would be super easy to program, but somehow no game has done anything cool with it yet.

Sure there were a few that tried, but in practice, it never amounts to more than a fancy dodge and move queue system.

The install is pretty quick, the download depends on your network.

I watched Final Fantasy XV: Kingsglaive while I was waiting, since I wanted to know the entire story. My download finished 30 before the movie was done, but I enjoyed the movie enough to finish it then move onto the game.
I bought the game on disc and had a 10gb install. Took 3.5 hours. Ending up playing Rise of the Tomb Raider on PC, then went to bed. Played 45 minutes before work this morning though, it's really fun. Wish I took a fucking sick day.

Not played this in a few weeks I'm jumping back on. 
You know you hate a person too much when you kill their titan, then Purposefully Nuke-eject from your own just to kill them in mid-air.
I heard that they're removing the whole RNG advocate gifts to get skins and camos. With credits you buy what you want whenever.
to me this is literally everything that's wrong with a FPS all rolled up into one trailer.
Glitchy character models at 0:16 - 0:17, look at the rooftop when he is wall running.﻿
Not yet titanfall. It's not been long enough.
That pound is, as they like to say, the straw that broke the Deathclaw's back.
Well, this wasn't invented by Bethesda, it's based on the encumbrance mechanics from classic roleplaying games like D&D.  I'm playing a halfling in a Pathfinder campaign right now where I've been nickel and diming the weight of my inventory by half a pound to stay at full speed.
Well I can't run with 301lbs of stuff, can you?
Quick Armin! Convince them Eren isn't an enemy to humanity!


...wait wrong Titan....

By the way the graphics in this game are freaking amaze balls.

...wait...
Is it A Titan? Or is it Titan.
not just A titan but The summon/primal Titan
Still installing...
Did they write the name of the game anywhere? This looks remarkably like an AoT Titan and I wouldn't have guessed it was supposed to from FF XV in a hundred years had OP not written it in the title.
How much money did they spend promoting this freaking game? It's been like a steady steam of promotion for 2 years (I don't recall actually but shit it feels like 2 years). 
Where exactly is this?
Is this in-game?
SIE SIND DAD ESSEN, UND WIR SIND DIE JAGER!!!
No, Giant friend.

He help anytime
Good friend no hit.
You can go to him and be friends. 
Funfact, if you choose the Young White Branch as a starter gift he will be your friend from the very beginning (just dont use the branch)
Only giant dick I know [rides a chariot](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Mara).
Who needs steady when you can hold 2 at once?
I thought he could flip tanks using a controlled burst of energy from his suit, not strength.
You don't flip tanks with your arms. That's all legs and pelvis son. 
Is like saying you can lift a couch but can't keep a bow and arrow steady lol. It's instant recoil, I get u doe ;)
I just saw a comment that explains this in response to a question about "retard strength". Let me paste it:

>retard strength comes from them being able to recruit all the muscle fibers at once. normal people can't do that unless they're on drugs or full of adrenaline. it's a human adaptation to not recruit all muscles cells at once. it's why we can type and use delicate screwdrivers while chimps cannot.

You did not make this.
If your search pixel painting there is the same picture that was posted a year ago . So tell me the truth.  
Hey, just keep faking you actually made things that have been around for two years. 
Wow. Way to take someone elses work as your own.
Maybe he's talking about the pixels on the banana. Are you talking about the banana?
Can you please explain your process?
The red headed girl looks like she is moon-walking...
How does one paint pixels?
LOVE IT
This is so beautiful you have no idea how I good you did this. I actually thought I was looking at a game on a screen for a while before I saw the table and all. Great work!

You should sell/ship these prints. I might actually buy one if I can lol
That looks like I'm playing it on a tube TV awesome job.
This brought some good nostalgia back, thank you for this! Loved Chrono!
Where'd you get this from 
It this made by you? Awesome work! 
I have one of these too. Got mine from Sanshee but they are sold out for now

https://sanshee.com/collections/bioshock/products/rapture-pin
I never knew I wanted this. Now I must have it. I need it like splicers need adam.
In all honesty the interviews were the most misleading
Hello Games probably paid them to say that. Because the billion other sites I read say it is.
damn it's gonna be so cool when all of us are in our 60/70/80s and still playing games from companies that aren't even around anymore haha
This is the best thing I've seen all day. :)
I only say gg when im winning
This is why I hate competitive online games. No one knows how to be graceful winning or losing.
Game?
sauce?

Dude what's up with Cup Noodle lately? They seem to be making a really strong marketing effort out of the blue. 

And they're just warming up...
Fuck, now I'm hungry.

It doesn't help that the food looks fantastic in this game, even the diner french fries!.
That's some of the money to help fund the game right there in that little sign alone. The sight and smell of those noodle cups almost make me insta-vomit; I've eaten so many of them back in the day. Gag. 
can you tell me exact brand of this Monitor ?
Are you a streamer?
I loved banished 
How dare they use an ingame screenshot from a little indie survival strategy game like banished to promote their crappy mobile games 😓
At least they chose a Great PC game screenshot to promote their crappy mobile game
Lol dood... Haha damnit, at least put an HD picture of like cover art.... Something!
Lol 
Still? I reported those ads in youtube about half year ago. Anyone contacted to banished maker?
In this case, I'm not worried. Both the betas I participated in ran great and the gameplay, in my opinion, seems very solid. There's more than a couple things I would fix, but I doubt the stigma attached here will apply. I'm buying this on launch to play with a dear friend and this news won't stop me. 
I don't think they will be met with the same success as Bethesda. Regards, this benefits no one but the publisher. 
Depends on the game. Something like Command and Conquer or Starcraft. Yes.
Rocket league isn't strategy, but it's helluva addictive. 
No.

So to get completely off topic, what bow is that?

Extra damage because the arrow turned sideways. 
Hmm are you sure? I didnt see a ring on his finger
If I made a valve app I would do that to the update logs all the time.
I love the people that take the time to put humour in the patch notes 
I have not played this in almost a year. Anything drastically new?

It used to be shit house
What was the original ham icon?
This game is the shit, I gotta get me and the boys back on this
FUCK YEAH, A GAME TITLE. WWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Huh, don't see many Project Zomboid posts on here!
Another reason why Red Dead Redemption is an amazing game.
Red Dead Redemptions version of twitter. Retweets must be time consuming.
If you look back at American and Mexican history you'll understand 
It's basically mexicans want to get rid of American migrants 
Looks good, the landing is completely unrealistic though. It looks like he's lowered onto the snow instead of slapping into it.
Is this coming to x box does anyone know? 
Steep's Open Beta was good. The animations need some looseness in SNOW, perhaps something like the Skate series and abit of IK.
Wait a second........ THIS ISNT STEEP!
You should try steep! 
Game is Dragon's Dogma, they're using the Godsbane item. Useful to reset chests for the loot you want, or farm Death himself.

Won't explain what it is because it'd spoil the story of a really great game. The dragon dialogue in the end fight is amazing, pick it up if you like the look of it.
How very r/oddlysatisfying

Does this post title literally make no sense or am I literally missing something.
"Nooo!"  
"Stay with me!"
More crap out of this rooms chests.

"Literally" what? What the hell does this title mean?
This game looks good. 
Kinda weird how none of their expressions change when they impale themselves.
Vault-Tec approves of this post.
I wonder if you could put the lights behind the label to make it look more authentic.
Well 2016 might be Earths last year, better finally release The Last Guardian.
Let us know what you think of it OP. 
WhatttttttttyWHATTTTTTTWHATTTT
It's finally out
I've been waiting a long time coming
How does a "part-time" reviewer get a review copy for a game like this?
Screw that embargo, and come back to this thread once you've started playing and give me a single word describing the game.
That's actually a Bad Meets Evil song, but Eminem is half of that so it still half counts. 
For the uninitiated:    

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGdPVsTliT8
At first I hated it, but then I realized its something so fucking odd its amazing. 
"You came to the wrong neighborhood, motherfucker"
I'd much prefer this: https://youtu.be/hEUOOgNzOv4
play in Station Dives
A masterpiece.

I'd buy based solely on this review.
I said it before the last time this was posted, but the game looks like complete shit.  Bunch of boy band weirdos running around talking about dresses, acting like no actual man behaves, talking about inane shit, camping and making noodles...I don't know who this game is made for but it's def not me.  I've watched a few let's play just to make sure we aren't seeing just a few scenes/dialog but no, the entire game is filled with this nonsense.
Because they are not really yours
Because who's going to buy a used game code?
Was this the map too?
Is it way better than the first?
>Award Award
Skeptical as fuck.
If you don't mind me asking: what's changed from the first one that make you say that? Haven't touched it yet, just want to know.
What do you mean, you just **played** it? It only came out like 11 hours ago...
I feel like I'm the only one that actually liked the first game.
I created an award called:  The "Afterthought Impulse-Buy During Winter Sale that I Actually Enjoy Thoroughly" Award.  Gave that one to Victor Vran.  
The quadcopter was just awesome, especially once you got the little bombs for it.
Still sad that Chicago hasn't been well represented in a video game yet.  Watch Dogs 1 had so hopeful back when I first saw it on E3.  =*( 
The first one didn't suck either 
I like the overall gameplay and the city is very well made. But I personaly couldnt stand this "wannabe hacker" style of characters. Everything is so badly made when it comes to characters or story that I really felt bad while playing it. Overall a good game that had a good gameplay and some good moments but the cutscenes and dialogues are a waste of any braincells.
Nice try ubisoft
Why is there so many quotes in there?  Why is there 2 awards?  So many questions.
I watched a review, I forgot who did it, but there was one point that really stuck to me.

The main characters a couple of guys, who want to expose the corrupted businesses around SF, right?
One of the big points of the game is gaining followers, no? 
So why can you 3D print guns and kill every single security guard to just expose somebody, and why do you get followers for that? Who would want to support and follow something comparable to a terrorist group?
Congratulations to Ubisoft, they finally made game that is:

- Not downgraded,
- Doesn't run like shit,
- Is actually decent gameplay/story wise.

...shouldn't it be **The "Holy Crap, 'This *Actually Didn't* Suck!' Award" Award?**

*"Actually didn't"* seems to fit waaaay better than *"Didn't actually"*...
Well thats good. I was hoping for the "I like the idea of it, but it kinda sucks," wasn't going to happen. Also from what I've heard/seen the main character is less of a jerk than the first guy.
C'mon GTA V already has 7 guiness awards and over 64 million copies sold. What rewards do you need more than that.
I want to play it but I know it doesn't run well on PC. What are your specs?
I honestly thought that the first one was very fun.
Why is this surprising? The first game didn't suck either.
More like "Not a Bad PC Port" award
I'm enjoying the campaign more than GTA. I didn't think I'd be able to say that
So far i'm really enjoying this game, Way more then the first one. The characters are over the top but it works, Give it an 8/10 at this point.
from what I heard it's much better than the first game. but is it good on its own? pretty much, is it worth 60$?
I'm Bobo Danks bitch!
Wait, no graphics downgrades? No shitty port? Not a bug filled unfinished mess?
Not a fan of the optimization.. my 1070 with 6700k cant get steady 60 at 1440p... refunded
Why did they have nudity in the game only to remove it later they could have just not had it in the first place
Not even going to pirate it unless they put the Vaginas back in!
The Hitman game wins that award.

I thought the episodic nature of it was going to be terrible. In actuality, going episodic was such a smart decision and let each, large map breathe on its own. 

It also kept my interest all throughout the year with new contracts, maps and different ways to play through levels. 
*From reading some comments*

I understand the game is good. However, is it worth $60?
This is actually a nice idea for an award, unlike most of the other award jokes.

Not sure if the reciever will appreciate, but it should have gotten interesting responses.
til you realise that the game also install a fucking rootkit on your PC...
No wonder you're trying to post "my clever award" meme after everyone tired of it. Because only such idiots like you could play and enjoy this modern marketing-driven sequel to a shit game.
If I made a valve app I would do that to the update logs all the time.
I love the people that take the time to put humour in the patch notes 
Game is FFXV
"Fuck the physics , I do what I want"
It is when you have firearms like a tree trunk and rock a mullet
We have damn near similar taste. Manhunt 1, mgs 1&2, indigo prophecy, gta, splinter cell. All games I played extensively.
Nice Lebowski poster. 😉
Gungrave was a weird little fun game that most people didn't know existed. Way too short though but fun.
Best I can do is 1,25
I still play manhunt and hit man 2
I spent slot of time on True Crime. I remember playing as Snoop Dogg was the shit. 
Manhunt, nice score there
Kingdom Hearts is not the only game that has universal keys.
"REAL GAMING SETUP"

*Uses Razer products*
lol whatever makes you sleep at night
Except for all the Razer logos
All Razer = real gaming? Right. Also, you can't get your wrists/armssupported properly with the keyboard being so close to the edge. And there is ridiculously little space for moving the mouse.. but whatever floats your boat.
What are those side monitors. Thinking about picking up one or two
Now that is some real gayming
Look at [this](http://on-winning.com/overwatch-pro-sensitivity-settings-setups-monitor-mouse-keyboard-headset/) list of hardware that the top eSports teams use. You'll probably notice that Razer do not in fact dominate the listings - think again. 
Looks like krusher99's set up. 
To the console gamers, this is the equivalent to a 'mad catz' setup. 
Wont that area become warm?
Razer used to be good, but now their QC is shit.


I just love the green glow of everything razor. Makes me all depressed and thirsty for mountain dew. And I don't even like mountain dew. 

You're not a real PC Gamer unless every peripheral that you own emits a green glow that looks terrible and makes everyone think you're like 12 years old. 

Where are the dumb adults with their sophisticated pc rig setups with no green glow, so I can tell them they suck? 
yeee boii
Everyone here is hating on Razer products but I love them. I have used Logitech, steel series and corsair before and while I like them I still prefer Razer. I do however not really understand what people mean by real gamer? Aren't we all? I mean I have been playing games my whole life and have a nice setup but because I use razer products I don't have a "Real gaming setup"? Is this a joke or just really stupid?
Not enough RGB's      
But still kickass!
Clearly fake
I just came a little
This game was my childhood 
Perfect spotting timing with the hand
Preorders start today.
A different era - and only 26 years ago.
Not the best title... since they were only trying to help and cheer up.
Practice makes perfect. Remember how many times it took Hank to bust Jesse at the Crystal Palace
damn. support starts at 4 a.m? and I thought starting work at 6 a.m is early. :s

Too advanced for you. Might need to call NASA.
I was a sales manager at Best Buy...

Those cases could be used for multiple things, most likely RAM was stored in there and some "driven" employee thought "if I stick this sticker on here I can sell a service on an accessory!"


"That'll be $200"
Cool joke bro. You can tell you peeled that sticker off something else and put it on the game. 
Back when I worked at bestbuy we had an offer to setup your Xbox or PlayStation in store so when you took it home it had all the updates... We literally turned it on and spammed a button like a dozen times. Maybe 3 or 4 menus tops. I forgot what we charged but it was incredibly stupid. And people bought it....
Hahahahahahahaha!
Instructions unclear, game stuck in anus
Glory to Arstotzka!
You get an upvote purely for putting the game title in the post title. Also wonderful game.
https://youtu.be/ZKrQ0ighMNo Every single time I see this game I go watch this
Is that "killer sideburns" or "killer, sideburns"?
MetalCanyon did an amazing playthrough of this game and now whenever I see images from the game I think of the music and his voice. Great game though.
Take that banner down. No hanging unauthorized items on the wall.
This would be a cool game in VR
Logan looks sad :(
Sounds cool, although the developers are gonna have to really strip it down because of all the complicated shit they have in their Total War games now.
That looks cool. Might watch this
Yes
Yesssss
Get the complete edition,  it is absolutely worth it if you like city builders. 
Even more than that if you like that kind of games. It's everything last Simcity is not. It's a good game. 
Even the base game, with no Dlc was fun. I woukd recommended at LEAST the after dark expansion because it's gorgeous at night. 

The amount of stuff on the Steam Workshop is ridiculously, so you can have not just a city management game, but also a game where you can choose almost every building by hand. It's probably worth it for the mods alone. 
I waited to pick this up for 17 bucks and I enjoy the game for what it is.

Its a fun game, just a weak entry into the falloutverse.
It reminds me of this time in oblivion where this guy asked me to kill some slaughterfish or something then I laughed at him and he got mad and wouldn't speak to me.  I wish it was still like that.
Is that unreasonable? They stop what they're saying to comment on you being a dick, then go back to the important thing they have to say?
Sheesh. It's like talking to my fucking *wife*.

Edit, after the downvote: dang it, I *KNEW* you were on here.

Remember we need milk. See you when I get home. *Looove* yoooouuuu!
To be fair, it's _Bethesda_ logic. F1-2 was quite different.
Just a reminder that this was mostly a Biowares thing, Beth stole it.
Whenever a NPC tells me they're mad at me or gives me a sarcastic answer. I kill them.
This is such a smart business idea. People are getting fed up with DLC's and early access stuff. Mark my words, we are going to see a lot more free play weekends in the future. It's what convinced me to buy Overwatch, and I'll be making my decision on TF2 this weekend I suppose. 
Hopefully this will convince all the people wondering if it's worth it to finally buy it. Come over to r/titanfall if y'all want some tips and tricks for begginers. You will very likely get your ass handed to you at first but it gets better. 
Ah. A nice chance to boost my K/D ratio. Come one, come all. 
LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Respawn Entertainment and Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) today announced that this holiday’s highest rated shooter, Titanfall® 2, will host a free trial of the game’s full multiplayer offering. The trial* will begin for EA Access and Origin Access members on November 30th, and become available for all non EA Access and Origin Access players starting December 2nd on Xbox One, PlayStation® 4 and Origin for PC. Trial players will get a chance to experience the fast and fluid multiplayer in Titanfall that “makes the competition feel clunky and staid in comparison,” according to Eurogamer. Those looking to continue this action into the full game will have all their multiplayer progress carryover, in addition to getting their hands-on what Entertainment Weekly calls, “one of the best single-player campaigns of the year.”
and it lasts until?
I may be high, but I couldn't determine from that terribly written and poorly formatted article: for how long does this trial run?
"The trial will begin for EA Access and Origin Access members on November 30th, and become available for all non EA Access and Origin Access players starting December 2nd"
Wait, that's tomorrow?


CANCEL EVERYTHING 
Sweet. Something else to play on my weekly 'get drunk and play video games before I fall asleep' Friday night.
Only starts on the 30th for people with Origin Access
Can't figure out how to download the game.
k so I dont have TF2 yet, but I have PS+, do you have to pay extra to play multiplayer? 
TL;DR November 2-4 if you don't have Access. 
Might give this a spin -- I get off work here in about 30 minutes (yay night shift)

I bought the original Titanfall, it was kind of fun, Battlefield will always be my weakness.    

I'd love to get into Overwatch and Titanfall 2, and still get my BF1 fix, however there are only so many free hours between work, and working on my house. 

Edit:  seems no free TF2 trial today for me... I'm not one of the people who pays for Origina access or whatever they call it.   I see that it opened up for everyone on 12/2, and will run till 12/4... gotta say I'm a bit disappointed now, with my crazy work hours, that means I might only get a single session in... *shrugs* guess we will see. 
The thing that sucks is I'd totally give it a shot if I wasn't so busy with FFXV this week.
So.. Titanfall 2 is such a great game that's doing so well that they have to give it away for free just to get people to play it?
LOL. You know the game is bombing when they do this.
Only 23 complaints?
I just drive with people in passive ..  Try to set up car meets
I enjoy killing other players but not just senselessly roaming the map interrupting peoples games.  Only when it is fun for both players.  I usually kill my friends on xbox a million times more often than any strangers.  Its all for the lulz
I usually end up shooting first before they shoot me! No questions asked, just rampage other players. Too many bad experiences i had trying to be a gentlemen on GTA V. Get them before they get you.
Didn't Worlds come out fuckin ages ago?
Why do games in the same genre have to "challenge" each other? You don't have to pick sides. 
Following to find out. 

Just re-downloaded the game, not sure if I am ready to commit to it again.
Most I've picked up was about tree hunnit fiddy.
no i don't
I remember playing on one. All that damn wood.

**Cries internally.**
That's a fair question, actually. 
Seriously, though. Do i need to play the other games to know whats going on?
OFC you do.
Yes, yes I do.
Awesome story man. My condolences go out to you and your pup. Also I didn't think there were any spoilers here, just a really cool story!
Sorry for the loss of your pupper. I've been meaning to get Firewatch because it seems like one of those games where you can get lost in, and forget about lifes troubles. 
There are play videos out there without commentary.
Ive wondered how to describe this game, therapeutic is most certainly the correct way.
Not trying to encourage you to go and watch a Let's Play, just to point out one thing.
> Let's Players make jokes, they try and comedy up everything

Markiplier did a pretty serious playthrough of the game. Of course there were jokes and stuff, but when dramatic things start in the game he doesn't try to cover it up with a comedy. So not all of them tell jokes nonstop despite the situation in the game.

> and try and put their experience upon you

But that's true.
I don't watch let's plays because watching other people play video games is a waste of time
Would love to play and maybe grab content for my YT channel. PM me if your interested
I would love to test this game. It looks like a blast!
awesome!  just fixing 1 bug and then I'll upload a link.  stay tuned

I hope that TV is secured so it doesn't fall over. 😿
So 12/2 - 12/4.  That means I might get it downloaded and installed by the time it ends.
For how long?

Any way to pre-download it on the PS4? Great way to cripple speed and/or servers if not...
Do i have to install origin? 
We don't need 4 threads about Titanfall free weekends
YES YES YES!

and then I remember my Plus account ran out while I was traveling....
They must really need players. I don't see MWR doing this, or Destiny, or Battlefield. I guess they really really need to push this trash game as much as possible.
This is a great way to have crappy players feel like gods for the weekend.  This happened 2x with TF2 when there was a free weekend and then when it went F2P.  My friends and I were like paid professionals compared to all the noobs that were rage quitting.  Felt really good before we quit shortly after.
The nintendo switch might be good.
The Vita is perfect for it honestly. 

I have to commute to work, so I usually play PSOne classics on my way
Depends on how legally you want to do this, there are many fine PS1 titles available on the Playstation Store that can be purchased and played on the PSP, Vita or even the PS3 (not portable, I know).  Whilst it's arguably a grey area if you own a copy of the game and are able to make a backup of it then you could look at an emulator that could play said backup, an example would be an android device running the emulator and a bluetooth controller or even on screen virtual buttons.  
Emulator on laptop
This sums up my experience with dark souls
Yep, seems about right
I dont get it. What happened?
"Oh crap, that mountain is in my way. I better go around". - pretty much every RPG.

Usually people say "busted my ass" or "worked my ass off", it sounds like you got caught in between. 
I care very little for karma or subs. What I love and what would really inspire me to create more of these is just comments and feedback, be they good, bad, or somewhere in between. I love doing these, and I have a lot of fun reading what people have to say.

https://i.imgur.com/FglOKz1.gifv
Why is the pause menu so broken in this game?
Love the panic knife lol
This must've probably happened in almost every war. Not everybody likes to die and not everybody wants to kill. Leaders have conflicts but soldiers have to suffer through it.
Can someone explain why this is a thing?

It's hilarious, but I just want to know.
r/gamersbeingbros
Tank was probably Canadian 
The more I see these, the less I believe they aren't setup. 
Tank can tell you've had a rough day.

No hang on, lets talk about how OP has like 3 posts in the first 4 pages of reddit, dude is on a roll. 
Omfg only has this happened to me like once before. Playing cod and the other dude walked up on me prone sniping. I waited for it, but he didnt shoot. 

We both stared and then jumped around and then he layed prone and pulled out a sniper. I layed down and we sniped for about 2 minutes before his teammate came for him and killed me on sight.

 I wonder if he yelled like I did **NNOOOO!!**
I love this trend. 
This happened to me last night, except I was in the tank. I also ran him over. I may be a dick, results are still pending. 
What game is this? BF1?
The tank was like "roger that"
I found that surprisingly funny.
How in gods name do you remember your username?
"Just came over to check up on you. You need anything? Snacks? Drinks? Condoms? I'll be over this hill if you need me!"
"Whoah Jeff, give me a little more time to invert my settings man."

"Oh ok. I'll shoot you later bro."

*Drives off*
What do we say to tanks?

Not today.
Am I the only one who sees this as a transaction at this point?

"Fine.  I'll let you live and leave easy points on the table, BUT I BETTER SEE THIS ON REDDIT/IMGUR LATER TONIGHT!"

What is going on here? I keep seeing these posts with a head shake followed by a tank airing mercy. Are... Are players actually becoming *decent people??*
this is actually adorable.... that 'no' on the tank got me
This is like if Pixar made a WW movie.

The tank wanted a friend but it's shy and your gun scared it off. :(
I bet that guy did Nazi see that tank coming!
Staged 
TANK: WOOO TIME TO KILL

guy: pls no kill

TANK: ... no kill *reverse*
The second peak over the hilltop really got me. Then I realized it was a 15 sec gif :[
I'm crying. This is my new favourite video of all time. lmaooooo
It's so nice seeing people not taking advantage of others online like always
It's like having a dance off in League of Legends. Sometimes you dance and they dance. Sometimes Blitz pulls you under his tower and his team devours you.
Few videos out that gone viral like this. 

Is there a mass majority of Canadians playing battle field one?
These are all so obviously staged.
Tank you
The entire plot of Furry. 
I love how this has become a thing among redditors. 
I die laughing every time I see something like this. I don't play shooters often but this makes me want to. 
British Pvt. Henry Tandey spares future leader of the Nazi Party, Adolf Hitler circa 1918 (colorized)
People are now staging this
Can someone explain to me why I find these mutual exchanges of left right left right so knee slappingly hilarious?  
So these are staged right?
Looks a bit staged with how long they linger in the pause menu
There should be a sub dedicated to these.
Tonight. You.
gamers who act like that, where are you? i must be with my kind!
Staged comedy is so funny!
I can't see these and not think about the Iron Giant.
https://youtu.be/UuCz3sGsim8?t=18s
Tank God understands your plead and grants you a second opportunity at life. I've only heard legends of this happening, but to see a video of it is undeniably remarkable.
TIL that WWI was pretty damn adorable.
That tanks in this game are freaking hilarious. 
Hang on... all I have to do to keep from getting killed in BF is shake my head?!
I don't understand how people have these type of encounters. A tank glances at me and I'm blown to bits lol.
I love it. the tank looks like it's shaking metaphorical head  like "ugh, bitch, I'm outta here"
Every time I try this they kill me :(
Pretty nice looking grass you got ther.
This is the best thing I've ever seen in my life.
This has just become tank meta
I'd like to believe this is truly two strangers having an understanding.
Seriously so..... cute......

At some point you have to wonder whether or not this was staged, given the previous events where the same happened and how long it has been since they were first posted. Plenty of time to make your own version and reap the karma I mean me too thanks.
I'm glad that this is a thing. Sometimes shit happens & u gotta do some adjustments in settings....or you had to take a quick piss.
Basically mrw I see any tank friend or foe in hardcore...

i see a trend here Kappa

Would've been funnier if they were like no. yes. no. yes. BOOM.

[or no, yes, yes, no, wait! BOOM](https://i.imgur.com/vmDC9DD.gif)
Only the Reddit community would be able to make this a thing. 
I love this shit every time!
Very few things on the internet make me laugh anymore but this made me laugh out loud.
Why did you linger without hitting the Options button before he appeared?
There seems to be a lot of polite chaps in this game.

Then again, it's suppose to simulate WW1 where the Christmas truce did happen. Such gentlemen. 
Stuff like this has to be staged like come on, like someone is actually cool enough to no just blow him up
Same thing happened to Hitler in WW1
Sometimes it's good to know when you're whipped before you start a fight.  
"Hey you need anything?"

"I'm good"

"Oh ok...

Hey you sure?"

Anyone else remember the Counter-Strike GO post like this a few months back?
There is hope in this world

Meanwhile on the canadian servers....
What game is this?
/u/jvroom
What's even funnier is when people try doing this because they've seen it on the internet and then they get killed. 

Like bitch this ain't Reddit my goal is to win 
Are these occurring during original gameplay or set up? How do you tell 
This just gave me respect for these style fps players. I'd lost that years ago. Thank you.
Why is this a thing?
this is staged af

op (/u/-___-___-__-___-___-) plz dont post fake shit thx    
fake
*Homer Simpson groan* "see you later"
Soldier: No R2D2! You will blow our cover.

*Tank nods head and rolls off*
this is my favorite thing to happen in multiplayer shooter games. this is like the 4th reiteration of the same type of circumstance, and I'm ready for more. 
Going to call fake as why would he wait with the cursor on the Options menu for so long like that until the tank came into view.... these used to be so funny now we have kids faking so hard for that karma... 
I loooove this. 
I guess you could say "Tanks a lot"

I'm sure this pun has been made 1000 times already
We all know a heavy tank won't do that ... I hate that evil toaster 
My heart tells me this should be in a /r/awww .... Such a cyoot tank.
I miss gaming like this. Brings me back. 
r/gamersbeingbros
Typical 2016 gamer, ready to quit as soon as the game isn't going their way. How disgraceful.
I forget which game, but there was a shooter I played that whenever someone was in the game-settings they would get a specific symbol over their head to show other players.
This didn't mean they couldn't get killed, but respectful players would know.
Anecdote time!

My Grandfather was Wehrmacht in WW2. Initially in the eastern front, he was transferred west just in time for Normandy and thought he had  finally gotten a lucky break. But noooo, just when things go from shit-situation to full blown clownfuck lunacy in the east, he gets put back. 


So he crawls through this trench during a Soviet assault and suddenly sees himself face to face with a red army man crawling towards him. 


They look at each other for a moment and then both crawl back to where they came from.

Kind of an "I've had enough of this crap" moment for both of them I guess. 
'in menu' kills are my favorite.


i give no mercy and expect no mercy lol
What I don't get is why he just keeps coming back over and over honestly stop toying with him 
Is this nodding "No" with tank turrets a thing? I have seen a few examples of this, but I don't play BF1 and I feel a bit out of the loop.
now that what you call an in game menu
I just feel like this stuff is staged at this point.
That's a set up, why wait on the options tab and not click it? 
Staged and fake. 
how many of these are staged now?
I don't get it... This was funny the first few times, but how is this shit at the top of this sub still? 
"No indeed"
Love it!
I love these gifs.
fake and gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Common courtesy, look how bad his team was losing by... 
I'm getting a feeling this was set up
I guess this is a meme now.
As fake as a strippers titties.
Oh look it's the same gif we saw a few weeks ago except this is less funny and more obviously set up 
People still upvote these staged encounters? Interesting.
This is the third or so BF1 gif of this type I've seen and they still make me laugh my ass off.
OMG this is SO funny!!!!!!111!!!1! What are the ODDS?! 
I imagine this is how Canadians avoid violence. "Not today eh?"
All ghillied up
Why does this happen so often!? Any time i try this I end up halfway across the map glitched into a wall.
Just got the game today. This will probably be me in a few hours as I'm adjusting settings. 
r/GamersBeingBros 
In WWI the soldiers really did have empathy from all the loved ones that they themselves had lost in the war.
What is this, tf2?
this is the definition of mercy
Its like  he walked in on you fapping
This is adorable 
It's like a modern All Quiet on the Western Front. 
A mini Christmas in July Truce.
The tank has shown mercy! Worship him you puny mortals!
this is awesome and i love seeing gifs like this, but i would have had to explode you. snipers generally bug the absolute shit out of me. i don't know how YOU play, but most snipers i see care absolutely nothing for helping the team or playing the objective and it nearly ruins my fun. >_< i was in a squad earlier and 3 of the other 4 people were snipers who did nothing but hide and shoot people. they got maybe 10 kills between them the whole game and zero flag captures. UGH PLAY THE FUCKING OBJECTIVE.
Just bought this game for $40 instead of battlefield 4 for only $10, hope I made the right decision!
I always laugh when I see things like this
This has never happened to me. I guess I just get paired with the sadists
oh shit mb
Too many of these videos get to the front page. They are so easily staged too. 
Reminds of the ending scene in Fury. 
Sorry I bothered you.
It's kinda like your mom walking in on you jacking off
I imagine this is how soldiers used to communicate with tank crews on the battlefield before handheld radios were invented.
Get out I'm piss!
Ahhh WW1... The gentleman's war.
OMG this was the nicest thing anyone could do in this game! I have a renewed faith in humanity. 
The tank almost seems disappointed.
This never happens to me!
Good sportsmanship ha
Did they play a football match afterwards?
So it actually works huh..
Is this the new thing to do in BF1?
Tried that last night with the train on the Sinai op. All I got was an "lmao, street" after he blew me up.
What was he trying to do in the menu? was he just trying to hide or something so he could grab a drink or soda or something?
Pls stop pls I beg
its like that final scene from fury 
Who actually does this? I wouldn't have stopped to let you signal. I say it was staged, but people be dumb so maybe not.
If karma is real, that tank went on to have a 50 kill streak. 
Get out, I'm piss! 
Should cross-post this to /r/gamersbeingbros  

Edit: I was a bit late but everyone should check it out. It's pretty great, but pretty new. 
Tank: You'll be dead soon anyway.
Hahahaha what even 
Pretty cool.
I laughed way harder than I should have.
Why did this start becoming a thing? What started this meme?
This is probably the best shit I ever saw. I'm in tears.
You know, I could totally see this happening in WW1. The soldiers didn't want to kill each other anyway.
This feels staged. There's been a recent surge of these kind of gifs happening in bf1. And why does the guy go into the menu and don't do anything?
Now everyone is gonna be doing this.
These are almost always staged
I would've killed him. Not my fault the guy is an idiot and using the pause menu during combat haha. Wait till you die or hide better.
r/gamersbeingbros
Battlefield has gotten so polite...
good bastion
Should of killed your ass.
Understanding your enemy is one of the greatest skills to be gained on the battlefield...
Would like to see one where the pls no pass is denied. 
We need more of this kind of peace 
Today you, tomorrow me.
today's politicians can learn something from this

That was awesome! Even if it was staged it's still well done!
I would be the asshole that nods yes and shoots him.
"heard u were talkin shit"
Damn, those temporal AA artefacts are horible. It's the smudge trails when objects are moving, most noticeble on the gun. Now you're going to see them in every game with TAA. You're welcome!
"No."
-"No. okay. bye" 
/r/pls_no
Make this a thing
You picked the only spot without grass or cover to lay down and go to the menu, whaddyaexpect??
😂😂😂😂
I feel like this is the same two people over and over again
😂😂😂😭😭😭
Reminded me of the last scene of the movie "Fury", where the last soldier from the tank was found by a German soldier, and was left alive.
Why did I upvote this? Could someone seriously try to answer that question?
Tried this twice, can't wait til the tank driver is a reddit user.
This never works when I do it
A wounded German soldier has his life spared by British tank crew (1916)
Good Guy Tank
BS. Ever since the first one was posted, dozens of these have been popping up. This, compared to the others though, looks completely staged. 
So staged.
That pause menu though...
What game?
/r/gamersbeingbros 
Lmao the way the tank backed out. "This guy is a friendly. No need to engage." 
Good guy tank
Bros being bros
I love the people who play this game it's always ask questions first shoot later 
This is so anticlimactic...noooo
That was cute.
I should be working out, and here I am on the flooring laughing at this lmao
It's the same joke everytime, and it gets me everytime.

Such a nice fellow.

I would have sent you to your maker as I'm trying to get that 10th Star with tanks.
I could feel the menu lag
tanks for not killing
Tank You.

............Not today.
This shit got old the second time someone made a gif of this.

This is what r/gamersbeingbros was made for! Check it out 
How did this practice of nodding "no" start? Why do enemy players not just ignore it and blow people like this to smithereens? 
Stop, Drop, And Roll
X-post this on /r/gamersbeingbros
how is he not killing you to pieces and teabagging your corpse?
Can someone please help me figure out how the frick to snipe and zero. Like I know how, but I'm struggling seriously 
Good guy Renault
Honest question, why does this happen so much in BF1? Is it like an in game joke/meme?
Oppam...
Just like those mousedroids
Yes! This is awesome. 
User is relevant.
Stuff like this seems to happen a lot on this game. Even in BF2 I've had friendly encounters with enemies. :P
mustve been a Canadian 
Cute tank
This makes me fucking happy yo. 
What's the deal with this shaking thing? I see it a lot. Is it common to see people doing it? I've never seen someone do it in BF1 when I play. 
This is great 
What game is this? 
I love internet people :,)
/r/GamersBeingBros
These are not the droids you are looking for
This is great sportsmanship... I would've mowed his ass like the lawn
Can someone please explain to my ignorant self why people do this? I'm guessing it's a way of asking to not be attacked or I won't attack you if you don't attack me?
Brings a smile to my face every time.

What the fuck is your username???
What a nice tanker. Hope you killed him last.
I fucking died
<(o_o<) (>o_o)> <(o_o<)
I loled. 
Canadian warfare 
I watched that 3 times thinking it was the same clip and the guy in the tank just kept coming back
I fully expected him to just get annihilated. 
/r/tanksbeingbros
I think we need to make a pls no compilation, I need videos.  I know of this other one in CSGO.

And there was another one involving a tank in Battlefield.

You gotta use the Pythagorean Theorem.  
This sub is one giant fucking circlejerk.

I've seen so many of these at this point that i'm 99 % sure they're mostly set up.
I member this from the tank's pov. 
These aren't the droids we're looking for.
I tank you
Omg I laughed my ass off, I can't stop laughing every time I watch it!
Why does he just hover over the options in the pause menu? Feels like a set up 
Watch out!!!
With the amount of these popping up, I call fake
r/gamersbeingbros
Why does quitting take forever? 
7000 like gg fajits 
This is beyond fake 
What game is this????
maybe it's time to buy this game coz i guess i can do this shake screen because i'm really bad at fps and all...
Its so cute!
I love these moments lol
I would have shit myself 
Man, these just ain't funny anymore
What is this? The Blackadder Comedy Hour.
Eh that's pretty good
"It is not your day to die. Remember this mercy the next time an ally of mine is in your crosshairs."
This seems to have become a 'thing' within BF1. You can just shake your head no and the tank will leave you alone, so long as you don't shoot first.
These are the best videos out there
okay.jpg
"No don't shoot I'm not playing!"

"Ok!"
"I'm peaceful, I'm investigating the dirt."

"Ok, you aren't my enemy."
Just like grandpaps told it 
I gotta poop, don't shoot
I love Fury.

Wahahahaha mercyyyyyy! 
After seeing this happen so often, I have to assume this is staged.
What game is this?
/r/gamersbeingbros
Watched this repeatedly, because it looked like the tank kept getting closer .... But it WASN'T!
ITS EVEN FUNNIER THE FOURTH TIME
Why wouldnt he kill him tho?
Haha. This would never work on ps4! 
I am not the enemy you are looking for.
"You are not the enemy I am looking for."

That menu lag is atrocious.
This looks like a secret society handshake.
Quality, love this. 
I cannot believe this happened on Xbox One.
Added to list of reasons why bf is better than cod
But why would you be this slow entering the options menu? Smells 😉
This is honestly superb.
man who would of thought it peace would be on the battlefield  
It's like the moment in the intro video
When the virtual PTSD strikes great that you fear to die even in-game...
This has gotten more and more common in bf1
"These are not the droids your looking for, Move along"
This should be in r/aww
"I am not the enemy you are looking for."
"You are not the enemy I am looking for.

Everyone is doing this now. No originality anymore
Only if this would work for me...
Looks fake. You sat at the "Options" selection for a while there. Completely set up for fake internet points.
I call fake. People in armored vehicles don't spare snipers, especially in my own base where vehicles spawn. 
how do you run into such nice people, this would never happen to me
Seen so many of these, they're quite boring now.
Well, looks like EA got another scripted ad that looks like gameplay to the top of reddit again. 
Why do we keep upvoting these? They're all staged af. 
wow this is totally organic and not staged
Fake
I wish this was a thing still

No matter how many times I see shit like this I'll always chuckle.

It's always fun when someone is willing to step away from the game for a little bit just to be silly.
We are really wearing the tread thin on this meme
Shit. Try that request in a PVP Server and you'll get camped for the next 3 hours. 

Motherfuckers will even pitch a beach umbrella and cooking fire while you're trying to run back to your corpse. 
wow this joke never gets old....
People should KoS beggars
Is this a dank battlefield may may now? This is the third gif were a tank has spared a pitiful hooman.
Oh look. It's the same bullshit that gets posted over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. 
That little turret wiggle is the cutest thing I've seen in ages. 

Ah, "Turret Wiggle", band name. 
Is this it now? Are we just going to see the same staged joke for the rest of BF1's lifetime?
This is why online video games always seem better then single player..cuz they are.
What game is this I am not a fan of FPS games and don't follow them but this looks really fun.
Oh it's a fucking loop jfc I watched that like seven times fuck
1k Up votes last time it was posted, 6k for the repost. At least OP reposted his own post....just kidding it is still pathetic. 
Made my day
Tank: "Pathetic..."
Is it weird that the roof of my mouth tickles when I eat too much beef and cheese?
Can't say I've ever not killed out of 'kindness'. Fuck, I even kill my own team when I can't find enemies quick enough for my liking. I'd make a terrible soldier.
This is what gaming has become. Sad! We had balls when I played
So this is the new trend eh? Setting up "please no" gifs? Lol. At least they're funny.
To be 100% honest...  If I find a guy like this...  I'm putting one between the eyes...
I don't understand this.  It's a Recon (Sniper) -- They deserve to die painfully.
Look at that ugly SSAO.
What game is this??
What game is this?
This feels staged...

Why is he in this spot on the map

Why would a tank go there?

He didn't click into options

Feels staged

Actually no, i know this is staged

Original was funny tho, and genuine 
The participation award generation folks.
/r/GamersBeingBros

The tank shook its turret and drove away
They weren't allowed to release it until it was finished. So hopefully it's in a better state than PC.
Out since June on PC.
why are you excited? I can tell you right now ive been had it on the xbone and its fuckn ass bro like straight 100% pure Columbian dookie. unless you play on a high performance computer rig this game is garbage. like its almost impossible to kill a dino they lag everywhere and its pretty much on low settings if it was played on a computer. save yourself the disappointment

Ill definitely jump on this weekend!
The Titanfall 2 PC multiplayer desperately needs more players, hopefully this will help out!!
And right before finals... hopefully I'll get a chance to try it out
I can't wait to check it out
20 bucks says my PC can't handle it
I have a one month free trial of EA access. If I use it will I be able to play Titanfall 2 on the 30th?
Its an ok game i got it from the wekeend sale. Its a good pick up n play in multiplayer i only,tried it cuz overwatch season wasnt active.


I don't know much about it, so forgive my ignorance of this game. I have a couple questions:

Is Titanfall 2 subscription only game? 
Will it cost a monthly fee to play after this free trial period?

One last question. I play games more for their single player campaigns. Does Tf2 have a campaign mode? Any good?
the 1st Crash was so damn hard...
Fans: "We want Crash on the PS4!"

Well...ND did made your wishes come true. Right?
It loads faster than current consoles. :D 
One of my favorite games of all time. 
Well imagine waiting hours for it to install!
Man, this was such a nice moment going into U4. Such a really nice surprise. 
Naughty Dog - The reason I own Playstations. 
"load?"
as if the ps4 doesn´t have to load/install.
Easily my favorite moment in a game in 2016
I love crash bandicoot!
Just made me realised this bit how badly the game had aged. 
Probably the best easter egg from [Uncharted 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFIySY-zkxs)
Crash Team Racing was not like this. I remember a lot of "And now, for another Naughty Dog production..."
That was definitely one of my top 5 gaming moments. 
Cause installing games on a ps4 dont take 30-60 minutes. Nope, no sir.
That's was fun playing a game thru a game 
By far the hardest trophy to achieve was the "beat crash high score" one.  Fucking frustrating
I know we're talking about crash right now, and not Uncharted 4; but seriously, how fucking amazing was Uncharted 4? Naughty Dog, you guys are my hero's.
Man, Uncharted 4 was so fucking good. It's literally worth buying a PS4 for, IMO (along with God of War 4).
Well, now the old PS is going to keep me busy for a few days. Thanks Reddit!
The first crash was a horrible game. Needlessly difficult and not that fun. Not to mention, saving sucks. Crash bandicoot 2 and 3 were vast improvements.
Such a cool moment!
Gameception.
I loved seeing Crash for a second in this game. I like how later in the game it's Nathan's "real life" Crash level. As someone who's played the whole Uncharted series, I have to say everything in this game was awesome. The puzzles, the graphics, even the plot left me feeling a little sad at the end! Good work Naughty Dog
That sound... soon as I heard that.. I almost cried.
tbh my PS4 actually takes a pretty long time to load. 
I'll give you "wait for it to load"...

[LOAD ""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbumzCdw4Ts)

Then after 15 minutes you get an R TAPE LOADING ERROR.
Funny because current games take way longer to load the intro before  the menu before the 1hr load time to get into the game.
It's funny because it actually takes longer now days. Lol. Pop in the game, wait for the update, go to the store, redeem code, for that install, wait for game install, aaaaaaannnnnd play. 
Wow! I gotta play the new Uncharted game.
Childhood game :')
the Crash of us.
Gotta love SSD's. 
But why post this now? The game is at least 6 months old...
My heart ❤💔
God Uncharted 4 was boring.
Top moment that ruined immersion in already mediocre game.
Was there a bit of a sexual pun when he says " when you turn something on your expect it to..."?
Incredible, what a time to be alive.
I've been playing it for hours now! It even saved my last run through of 93 hours! I've been waiting for this moment to start over again!
By Azura! By Azura! By Azura!
nice

Are any of the DLC available?
Yay input lag!
Expect No Man's Sky meme's.
Uncharted 4
I think it would have to be Final Fantasy :) 
FFXV and it's not even close. 
Overwatch 
I'd say Blood & Wine. Even if it's "just" an extension, it's still the most fun, wonderful and marvellous time I had this year. 

Otherwise, I'd have to chose between Uncharted 4, XCOM 2 and Dishonored 2. They're sequels, but sequels done right, really mastering the original formula even when it was clunky (looking at you, Uncharted)
darkest dungeon.
Uncharted 4 is mind-blowing. 
With No Man's Sky sinking faster than the Titanic I would pick BF1
Dark Souls 3
Far cry Primal.
Uncharted 4. I've never played something so... polished. 
Doom. 
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
I prefer [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzJDimvPW1Y) dark souls version
Perfect

I keep seeing this as well. I just assumed it was r/softwaregore and kept scrolling.

No no, people love No Man's Sky now. It got one update that apparently made things slightly better but still nothing like what was promised.

Thank you for putting the title in the post. I hadn't heard of this game and it looks fantastic. 
How is the game going ?

I had it at the very beggining, there was only rotation in the game. 

Is there a sort a AI now ?
It's the day every parent dreads; you must be proud of your hatchling. 
Edit:they grow up so fast
How in-depth is this game? I would only get it with my friends, is the online actually good? 
Reminds me of Gizmoduck/Fenton Crackshell
Wow. Two distinct Fentons in this thread.
I once made a unicycle in that game. It eventually pulled a Fenton, I think something just causes the electronics you put into a machine to break and fire everything when you overload it.
Needs more giant letters
"Beeeeeeeee ouuuuur guest . . .

Fuck! Fuck!! FUCK!!!"
I feel like I'm looking at prop hunt in Dark Souls.
"KAIOKEN"
So I love these posts and it looks fun but I always though it was a single player game. Does it have online multiplayer?

Why the hell are you running around with 300k souls?
I'm a simple man, I see Dark Souls I upvote 
It doesn't look like anything to me.
"You see Ivan, When you hide as chair it makes the finding harder"
I didn't see them please explain /s
Quick! Chair casually!

"Doo doo doo doo doo" *whistles*
Omfg lmfao this is hilarious 
Nice...
Hahahahahh
So was Prop Hunt added to DS3 or what's going on?
I'm rolling bruh omg.
This is awful to watch... full havels, the miracle that makes it so you don't die and the dragon axe

Haha 😂😂 Oh my god I didn't even thought of that
Get this facebook caption bullshit off reddit you copypasting sack of shit
Who's asking?

Ah, you must be the white kid in the back of the class.

If you enjoyed this low quality gif repost, here is the [original webm](https://gfycat.com/UnitedRigidAmericanwirehair) ^[\[source\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4xzh1q/youstayigo/), and here is a [bonus version with sound](https://youtu.be/zfMq6pZQNr0) ^[\[source\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4xzh1q/youstayigo/d6k42g6/).
That is the most gangster thing that I've ever seen in Overwatch. KUDOS.
🎶There goes my hero🎶
That takes some serious reaction time.  Hooking a player with Roadhog being on the ground will typically pull them to you, and I'm pretty sure Roadhog essentially becomes the anchor.  If Roadhog is in the air, they are not fixed in that spot (correct me if I'm wrong).

So the Roadhog here watched D.Va launch out of the pit and engage self destruct, the Roadhog aimed, jumped, and shot the hook, all while being in position to pull the D.Va down into the pit with him.

And this is why I stopped playing Overwatch.  People are insanely talented at that game.
This gets shittier lower quality every time it's posted.
As someone who doesn't play over watch but is still interested in the feat performed what is it that I'm looking at? Why is it so cool/difficult to do?
Seriously? If you're going to repost, at least link one with more than 12 pixels.
I was playing Lucio once and shockwaved the enemy Roadhog off of a ledge - just as he hooked one of my teammates and dragged them down too.

Damn it.
This subreddit is being filled almost entirely with reposts  
Creds to /u/dinosauraids , his other ones are great too.
Fly, you fools
I was having a good day until you reminded me of the great Shakespearean tragedy known as the iron giant. Thanks. 
[Higher quality](https://gfycat.com/UnitedRigidAmericanwirehair). One of the top posts of all time on /r/overwatch.
I once saw a roadhog do that to my mech. Except he didn't jump off a ledge. He pulled it through the chokepoint to his team and gave me a pentakill. 
This is like a repost of a repost bruh
This is amazing. Tears were shed.
Just think, this sort of shit saves teammates from Michael Bay: The Ultimate™.
"Had to be me. Someone else...might have gotten it wrong."
Reposters I've come to bargain
[For those who want to revisit the past :'\(](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNWK_Y_ibcE)[.](http://i.imgur.com/jWr67J8.png?1)
That movie was my childhood
I actually felt emotions from this, what the fuck.
I wish stuff like this got Play of the Game. Sure massacring half the team is cool and all, but I'd rather see impressive stuff like this in a heartbeat. 
Oh look, old content that's been posted a hundred times before! Yeah, that depresses me too.
#**THERE GOES MY HERO**
This would make more sense if I played Overwatch.
http://imgur.com/gallery/6EB2lPJ
...:'(
I'm depressed by the framerate, and the image quality.
that.... that was beautiful
To be honest it looks like the D.Va mis-timed it and it would have exploded harmlessly in the air, killing nobody.
NO, YOU'RE CRYING!
Once again, I have no fucking idea what the hell is going on in an Overwatch gif. 
I can't tell if the mech was destroyed before it hit the kill zone or not. If it was destroyed after hitting the killzone he even denied d.va her mech back.
Did you show this to Barrick? Cause this is pure gold my friend.
Not all heroes wear capes.
LOL safe to say I am IMPRESSED!

This ended just as I hoped
Lmfao the editing on this is A++ 5/7
I came here to relieve my boredom, not to feel.  
Wow thanks now my day ruined.
And people wondered why Roadhog was called a hero.  Animals.
Sad that the crummy play of the game system probably didn't highlight this because it wasn't some form of multikill...
What a fucking play
Will never get tired of this GIF.
Imagine if he had missed the hook.
As a Roadhog player, this made my pants tight. 
As an Iron Giant lover, this made me tear up a bit. 
I think I remember a much higher quality version of this from months ago
This was posted on r/overwatch awhile back

Oscar worthy performance by Vin Diesel. 
I'm crying, but I can't tell if I'm crying from laughter or sadness.
I feel you bro. 
And no way Bliz called that PoG, that was slick.
The Iron Giant was such a great movie.
That movie was so great 
There goes my hero...
100% thought op was gonna pull it down and it was going to explode before it go low enough and was going to ace his team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lfJMIwHDEM
This deserves more upvotes than I can give it.
The quality of this gif made me depressed
Rip in peppertollies 
I've only had the opposite happen...while I was hiding in cover
F
Bet that did not even get potg.
This image quality depresses me.
Beautiful
Me too thanks
Now if only my friend can do that and not FUCKING PULL IT BEHIND MY REINHARDT SHIELD WITH 2 OTHER PEOPLE BEHIND IT KILLING US ALL
^What cartoon is that please.
This made me laugh so much that happy tears turned into sad tears because I starting thinking about the movie again.
Gets me every time.
I cried a little. Awesome post
I would too with that framerate
I did this in the early days of overwatch as Reinhardt, my shield was gone and I knew what I had to do to save my team. I charged it off a cliff while my friend screamed, "NOOOOO!!!"
As a roadhog main, I'm proud of this play. But I'm also filled with the remembered feelings from that movie. 
Repost. Anyone remember who the original belongs to?
#YEEEEEEEEEET
"Screw our country, I want to live!"
I posted something similar a while back... I wish I had the editing skills and originality to do this before you did. 
I'm not sure I like TF2's changes
thats actually such a sick play
New COD looks weird. 
I remember having a plastic iron giant toy as a kid. Its shins opened like doors to reveal some cool ass lasers. 
The quality in this repost just continues to go downhill
love reposts.
Whaaattt? Hey, if you dont want the robot I'll take it.
More like impressed not depressed
You are who you choose to be
[In case you thought it was sad without audio...](https://youtu.be/zpP8uQ7K_Is) 
Not all wears hero capes
Every .fucking. time. 
Roadhog- I'm the hero that Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs. 
I haven't played OW, but what did he do?
Vin Diesel's best role.
At the framerate?
Holy SHIT HOLY SHIT 
Because of your 480p monitor?
As a D.Va main, I think I'm depressed for different reasons
How is a repost on the front page
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcBPd16qS3w
Never using DVA ult again, just going to get into feels. :'(
I cried
I didn't need to be reminded of that...
[The fact that I was listening to this made watching this .gif 1000x better.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBI3lc18k8Q)

I love everything about this!
"BTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!"  
  
I just made myself sad..

O SHIT!
This man in a hero
This was one of the first posts I saw when I joined Reddit a few months back, still my favorite Overwatch gifs
I smell a repost.

A good repost, but a repost, nevertheless.
I am *groot*...
Souls... Don't... Die...
So is the D.va
Equally as depressing as when my sentry bot from fallout 4 saved my life via self destruct against a couple of mutants. 

"You stay, I go."
LOL. Look like an idiot in the office rn for laughing so much.
The feels. :'(
I think...I think this is the best gif ever made ;-;
Even as a kid I never thought the ending to that movie was sad. He didn't die! His body began the reconstruction process at the end of the movie! 
Good shit!!! That was awesome!!
I bought Overwatch when it was new.  It was kinda fun for a couple weeks.  I barely ever play it now.  Weird thing is, I HATE seeing gifs of it and whatnot on Reddit.  Not sure why.  I think it's completely turned me off to playing the game.
[deleted]
Why isn't this an 8000 karma post?
Really?
Free to use, feel free to share it anytime!
I think it looks pretty interesting. I am a huge fan of house builders and in my experience what separates a good builder from a great builder is clutter. Real houses have crap in them, mail on the table, makeup in the bathroom, spices in the kitchen...junk you know? Its what makes a house a home. If I could put those things on the counter and hell even the floor, I would be in love.
Was I the only one waiting for him to invite that woman in and kill her with an ax?
This reminds me of another game where you can pretty much do anything, I think it's called life?

Those eyes.
No one told me Battlefield had Terminators.
Okay now I'm convinced the next Battlefield needs to be World War I but with robot soldiers and weapons. 
He went from soldier to Dark Raiden real quick amiright 
This must've been how he felt killing the Transformers franchise 
Not enough explosions.
So I haven't played or watched any BF1 so could someone explain to me the red eyes and explosions in the gif (as well as other gifs on this sub)
Apparently he turned into a Hellgast at the end.
The red eyes got me.
No one asked for it, yet [here it is](http://imgur.com/gallery/JujrQ).
The smoothness <3
This is for... Mathilda.

BOOM
That frame rate though
**N-NANI!?**
That 60 fps

*Unzips pants*
Didn't know Reverse Flash fought in WWI.
This frame rate makes me happy
Well... I mean, you just got chopped by a demon... He was probably just gassy.
I wonder if Defaultgeek ever got that medic.
Hes the f””““ing terminator

Ahhhhh!!!!
"Boss! It's the skulls!"
Minutes into this sub makes me want to play BF1 even though i dont really play lots of FPS
This is a good .gif
Now you are also dead inside.
That framerate 
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 looks so good.
Terminator eyes aside; I see Charlie Sheen's perspective from platoon with "Barnes!"
Some blowup!
Those eyes, How does that even happen?
What was with those fucking eyes at the end?! Does that happen all the time?
is this machinima? Why are his eyes glowing, is that normal?
Gives me Bloodborne vibes, and a hint of something else I can't put my finger on. Hellsing maybe?
Alucard.gif

those eyes look like straight from some anime or something.
What specs are you running? I couldn't hope to get framerate that smooth with my CPU.
This really looks like something from a Call of Duty campaign.

This reminds me of Hellsing
that's the reverse.
his name is cyber4s, makes sense
Reminds me of the ending from Platoon. 
Hello Darkness my old friend
It Is says  after the  fall Helgast society  remnants  ventured into the past to create a different future

more like jamescamron.gif 

It's like the hard guys in Dark Souls
You get an upvote just for putting the game title in your post. And its a legit gif. 
No no Its Red Eyes from Sao
That's the Dragonslayer from Berserk...
It really is!
What the hell is going on in this pic? And is the sword real?
*clang*
For when throwing the chanclas is not enough
no
Yeah - you're high dude. It happens.
Five Minutes, maybe.  More than 10 and you're probably high as fuck.
Only when I buy a game and watch the screen while it downloads the 10 gig opening day patch
How far down the spectrum are you?
I looked at no mans sky for about 5 minutes but when I played the game I realized it was shit
Only to Skyrim 
If you stare a screen that does nothing besides just having a loop song for +1 hours then you might have some problems.
No one does this. 
Hey did you watch the movie? That action scene at the end was awesome 
Not even once.
Intro to Ducktales Remastered gave me such huge chills that I just let it play for about 10 minutes. 
sounds weird but possible 
Honestly... never. What are you getting from that? And I've played games on all types of psychedelics and other substances.

EDIT: But I play games like Skyrim and spend 30+ minutes preparing and eating a meal with my NPCs. Afterwards I'll put my bedroll down by the water just to sit and relax a bit while I rest up for a long sad day working the mines tomorrow. I'm not all that normal either.
You need to get yourself checked. 

Not for staring at the screen, but for shitposting
Bro I do this. We're out there. It's like the moment before you pull the plastic off a new electronic. 
Nope.
Never
Can't say I do that, but sometimes I do finally get a game I was all hyped up about, then put it on my shelf because well, I'm still in the middle of something else, then said new game sits there unplayed for months.  Looking at you Uncharted 4 and Xenoblade Chronicles X.
No not yet😩
I like to listen to the full title screen song.  I especially do this in final fantasy.  If the song is really good, I will sit and listen to it a few times.  Like FFXIII'S title screen music is awsome!
no
seing the uncanny character models, it surely is "special".
I actually do that a lot. I'll put the game in and leave the home screen up while I screw around online and take in that feeling of anticipation.
No, especially not with Final Fantasy games, considering there's a high likelihood there's going to be about two hours of cinematics to watch after you press start and before you actually begin playing. 
Yes👌
No that's weird. 
haa haa sucker!
Did you finish the storY?

Have you seen the moded part check below :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYnJHBerb-M
I just run experiments inside my vault.
Who won the fight? FINISH THE STORY, MAN!
Don't worry about the main story.. not a lot happens. 
Oh thank god, I thought I was the only one.
sick roll dude
I like that you left the roll at the beginning. 

Someone out there is gonna see that and be like "sick roll dude"
Controller or bad?
Nice shot(s)
You missed 100% of the shots you didn't take. Congratulations.
Love it and want it myself :(
Beautiful. If I hadn't already spent so much on Black Friday, I might have gotten one, myself.
not a pokemon fan but still dope!
I bet those fur pelts used to be brown/orange
Sleeping well after rubbing one off.
That's disturbing...have you seen skyrim's houses?

The kids don't get their own rooms.

(mine does, but that's because I respect their privacy...and I'm usually off killing people)
wow I never knew this existed. I mean it goes with the whole thing where people upload viruses just to fuck with people, but in a game that already frustrates people and makes them scream it's pretty shitty.

I have noticed people with that Martini-Henry wasting entire squads before reloading, and super touchy sensitivity settings can certainly make it seem people are cheating, but what you describe sounds like the real asshole deal. 

Don't be discouraged, mate. The game *is* fun and you don't encounter those bot users that often. 


My problem with BF1 is everyone in the world purposely getting their blimp destroyed so they can run on the top of it.
I feel you, i hate cheaters too. Cheating is for single player only. But don't worry, cheaters will never be great players.
From what I've read the improvement isn't worth it...yet.

There may be games that receive worthwhile patches for Pro in the future just not yet.
I would've posted this yesterday, buuuuut I figured everybody would've been too busy tearing through FF15 to care.
Maybe because you tried to kill me and rape my mother.
12.25 years ago 😢 
Glue a key on top of the ps4, watch it. Don't stop. You're gonna be bored because of a key, which is moslty like *key bored*.
I squanch this game
Fuck Tammy.
I'd trade for it.
Squach

Man I don't want that dumb looking thing but I don't want a lame owl or a goofy looking seal. Can you find other starters in the game?
Game?
I've given up
I follow the game closely and am active on the subreddit. The game already gets played, I like seeing and hearing about the development, I love having checking out the new stuff and seeing it grow. 

I got my money's worth
Put 20 hours into already.
Very fun, the combat makes me feel like a badass without being overly complicated.
Yes there is still some strategy involved, because a battle can go south quickly if your not using the right teammate moves and parrying correctly.
The story I enjoy, the banter between characters are great.
The visuals are good enough for me.
Love riding the Chocobo.
Concept of deadly monsters coming out at night is a cool challenge.
Enjoying the hunts.
Camera gets wonky at times, specifically close quarter combat in like tunnels or dungeons.
I really love how open it is.
My brother in law is 70% through the story at level 34, I am 18% through at 27.
We are taking different approaches it's just cool to see.
I love it so far took off work yesterday about 20 hours in on chapter 3 taking my time. Seriously it's great 
Well in the lore they did bang at one point.
Silly soldier... you shouldn't have brought a gun to a warship fight
"Did I get'em? Are they dead? Guys..?" 
this guy has "Rekt" copied to his clipboard, ready to paste.

That's pretty MLG.
What game is this? I bee dumb yo.
Guess this is what "max settings" looks like on a Radeon 9800 pro. 
"I'm gonna pick you up...oh whoops...sorry bro!"
When I used to play 1.6 my name was:

---------NOOBS BELOW THIS LINE--------
It probably means I deranked and didn't notice.
Considering I'm pretty bad at CS, if I'm in the first place, my team is probably composed of semi-comatose retarded children.
This is usually the case on Battlefield. The few times I'll snipe just for the lols (I suck at it) and I'm some how first place. Confused, I'll look at what my team is doing and be shocked. They're all doing stupid stunts or trolling other players. 
I'm really only good at supporting my team (cover fire, etc) so if I'm in first, somethings going wrong.
This is me in Overwatch. If I am leading, we are in serious trouble.

Me talking to my roommate last night

"Ah yeah I got the most kills in my team last match. I'm fucking amazing at this shit. I should go pro"

My roommate "oh cool, how many kills"

Meirl ". . . 2"
Every time I carry a game im like: " How the *fuck* did I do that? My K/D is under 1!"
I can relate. My saying to get my squad back in line is "I shouldn't be 1st guys. This isn't right..."
This is me for most shooters. I'm a mid level player at best. If I'm carrying the team "shit" this is not good. I can't be trusted with that responsibility.
I have been playing Unreal Tournament 4. When I first started, I was doing really well. I was super stoked with myself, until a few games later I noticed the names of the other players never change... I was playing against bots.

Joined an actual hosted game, and got absolutely destroyed. Haha, good times.
I play R6, when i'm in first place i just think i'm having a good day and that's it. I played with some high ranked people yesterday and i got my ass kicked, i suck, but sometimes i have a good day.
I see myself in the #1 spot and immediately think "so that's why we're losing"
ITT: Zero self-confidence in video games. If you're first then celebrate that fact with a frosty chocolate milkshake. Don't forget to tell the enemy team to get rekt.
99% of the time if I'm in front, it's me and a bunch of one thumbed, vision impaired fart-sniffers with arthritic index fingers.


I am usually first place on a losing team. :/
This is me with any competitive multi-player. 

Titanfall 2? Oh fuck, I'm top of the leaderboard, god help us. 

Smite? Jesus, I've been matched with the people just starting out haven't I?

Overwatch? How the hell am I Platinum?! How the fuck are the rest of you worse than I am I?!

Rainbow 6 Siege? Might as well give up....

When I'm playing Reaper or Roadhog in Overwatch and I'm leading in healing with a Mercy on my team, I know something is going horribly wrong. 
This is me in TF2. Both of them. 
I remember the moment I realized I had played too much COD. 

My team won a game and when I checked the scores I was the only one on my team with a positive KDA. I had one man killing machined the entire enemy team the whole game. 

So I moved on to other games.
Thanks for the weekly repost.
I once made the mistake of thinking that I was actually good because I was first place on my team for two straight games. I never made that mistake again
If im top two in my team, you can bet we are losing. 
Is every post on this subreddit a repost
I get the same feeling in Overwatch.  When I am playing Lucio and have 5 golds, then something is going wrong with the team.
If I'm first and my team is somehow winning, I always think that it's because the other team is really, really bad. 
Reminds me of the time I fired up CS:Source for the first time after a long break. Got into a server, was doing great, feeling good! Number one on the server! (never happens) It took me about 20 minutes to realize everyone else on the server was a bot....
Tf2 for me.
I'm usually at the top 4 but never first. I play pyro so try to help my team more then get kills. If I'm first that usually means we're going to lose because I'm not supporting as much as attacking.
As an extension to this train of thought, if you're only in first place when your team sucks it probably means that you're *okay* at best.
Rocket League in a nutshell for me. 
KDR >0.5? How'd I get matched against stoned 6 year olds?
I remember I was absolutely crushing at TF2 many years ago and after a couple hours i realized I was playing bots
👌
Yea not playing for months, not having a rank, playing and top fragging on the server... team really does suck 
How I feel when I have four gold medals in Overwatch when I'm performing poorly.
i'm so glad this meme exists. i so feel this way. i like to sherpa, but i hate to carry. 
There's first place and there's "I have 60% of the score" with 5-10 other people in my team. I rarely say anything about it but oh my fuck if they even talk shit to me. I'll tear them a new asshole.
This happens to me when playing COD4:MW as well. I went 16-1 last night and was pretty happy about it but then looked at the score and we lost by 20 points, everyone else on my team got their asses kicked. So I basically just did good because my team was a bunch of walking distractions to draw people out for me to kill.
I know I suck. If I'm first then I can't believe there are people worse then me. 
For me, it means both teems suck.  How else can I get 10 kills in a row with a Chafee in War Thunder.
Damn right that's me. Every time I'm in first I'm like "how shitty is my team?".
I am always number 1 on the losing team 
It's even worse when you're playing like garbage but still have more kills than the rest of your team combined.
I once got cussed out by a teammate in rocket league for being bad after losing a 2v2 game 5 - 4. I had all four goals.....
The first time I ever played Star Wars Battlefront II, I ended up on top of my team's leaderboard. I then got to be Darth Vader and started charging around Hoth slaughtering friend and foe alike (mostly friend). Somehow my team still won. It was a wonderful experience.
The fact that reddit upvoted this to first place...  
Yup
This is me. 
In BF2. 
In Tribes. 
In Titanfall. 
In Counterstrike. 
In DoD. 
In TF2. 
In Destiny. 

If I ever check and see I am in first place it means the rest of my team went AFK. 
I am so bad at CSGO that if I am actually in first place then my team definitely sucks. 
To be fair, I'm horrible at CS:GO, but I still love to play. So when I'm in first, I can put money on the fact that my team just sucks. 
If I'm in first place, clearly I deserve to be a rank higher, right? 
Pshhhh nah. More like, my teammate got a 4k and died. Then I secure the ace by blind spraying like a monkey. Type in all chat, "All me. Get rekt. gg uninstall kys."
I'm the opposite. If I'm in first it means I have a pretty good team or the other team is terrible. I'm not amazing but I've been playing shooters since I was 10 so I hope I'm good with 20 years experience.
I've never thought about that like this....

Thanks bro. 
I would not consider myself bad or good in FPS just kinda average so I get a little confused when I join random teams and I do better than all of them and the enemy's team. 
I feel the opposite. When my team is doing well, I'm DESTROYING. When they're floundering, I barely hold my own.
I was the OP thank you very much
Same for me in Rocketleague. Point leader with 0 goals? This must be a terrible team.
Was playing BF4 last night and when I glanced at the scoreboard, I thought the exact same thing. 
nice meme op
This is how I feel.


I'm okay at best in PVP,  if I'm top of the board for my team they must not be very good.

If I'm wrecking everyone in the match then something horrible has happened with matchmaking or the other team has all slipped into comas.
I started playing about 2 weeks ago. I get 20+ kills every game and am leading my team most of the time. 
It's funny because it's true
Can confirm, am silver one and consistently go 30-10 with 40% headshot
Heh, I only play torbjorn in Overwatch ranked... inevitably whenever my team starts flaming me, I'm got at least a bronze in damage, more often than not it's gold.

This is so true.
I'm a super streaky player. I'll often be the guy on the middle of the list with 3 or 4 MVPs. Often I'm sitting around a 4:3 KD ratio with every 2nd or 3rd round me being dead first. But sometimes I do go like 20:3 KD and scrubs will start accusing me of hacking.

I always rush with an SG or Aug. Usually I shoot faster than the Awpers, but I need to get the headshot to beat them. So if the map becomes 90% AWPs, then my strategy tends to be a fail. But I like meeting guys head on, whacking them, then shooting the rest of the team in the back. But the strategy really does depend on the map.
every fucking repost http://i.imgur.com/JrJnxMV.png
I feel this way when I play Paladins or Overwatch. Im by no means terrible, but if im getting golds across the board something was seriously wrong. 
This is especially true when I'm playing a 64 player Battlefield server
I just assume there is some kind of glitch or I am lagging badly or something. I normally have about 1.15ish I'd but on these it's randomly something insane like 25/2 or something nuts like that and I'm not doing anything special.

That or I accidentally clicked on 'special' team death match and  everyone just feels sorry for me
Or the other team sucks 
I was told by other team I just about carried the team (just about because we still lost)... as Pharah. I'll admit, a had an uncommonly great game, but it counts.
For me its more like "Hey I'm doing pretty good this round!" *checks scores and see the server is full of bots*......... :'(
Every time I am the VIP in my team I feel like I am the top player and I need to exert myself as the alpha male of the pack.
At least I don't have this problem, since I'm always in last place.
If im top scoring in TF2 with a style that can only be described as "well I'm already jumping into the enemy setup hope nothing too bad goes wrong" then you all suck
Kinda. I'm bad AF. Whenever I'm first is either my teammates suck harder than I do or that the other team is losing heavily on their battle against severe brain damage
/u/isaylittlebuddy pretty much you...
well thats a pretty silver thing to say
I'm usually near the top in BF1 because I teamplay like a motherfucker.  If you're anywhere near me and die I'll not only revive you but kill the dude who killed you and the 2 friends around him.  Then I'll run over to them after reviving you and teabag him for good measure.  All while b eing on a flag capping it.
This has me written all over it.

I've been trying to PTFO on battlefield more and more each time and I end up ranking higher. 

Still the feeling of my team sucking into the void is present.


What a normie meme
I'm a "golden game" kinda guy. I usually get .80-.90 K/D but once every 10 games something will happen and I'll get like a 2.0 K/D.
I never really feel this way.  I'm an ex competitive css player, now playing csgo, but only a few games a week. Most of the time, I'm playing tired, can't aim, and just suck balls. I've gone 3-18 in a competitive game before. But if I'm feeling good, I can top frag,and feel good about it, even in esea. It's annoying because I know how capable I once was, but I just don't have the time to be consistent anymore. 
I'm DOMINATING in Titanfall Bounty Hunt these days. And I suck pretty bad.. It seems like my team never remembers to cash in their bonus.  When my team reaches the $5000 goal, I'm always at like $3500. 
My favorite is when someone is getting snotty in online games saying stuff like "MAN, YOU GUYS FUCKING SUCK!"

Then you look at the board and they are the worst of the bunch. It's like you are already kind of a jerk by spouting off even if you are doing well, but you have no room to shit talk if you aren't contributing either.

Yes...maybe we do "suck", but you are in here with us, bro.
I've largely given up destiny, but I still keep in touch with my very sweaty, and actually very skilled fireteam and will join them for crucible occasionally.  Whenever I finish the game on top i make a point to shit talk them, because i was never as good as they are, AND i don't even play the game any more.
When you and a random smack the lobby so matchmaking decides to split you up for the next game.
Does anyone else that has played from the pre 1.6 days hate GO? I can play the older versions just fine but something about GO really puts me off.
I feel this when I play overwatch.
thats how i feel about heroes of the storm, if i get game mvp, then holy shit we're all terrible
Wow,my team is so shit. I mean, Bot Ulric barely has any kills... oh wait.
Isn't this a repost?
P-90 & UMP :DDDDD
hear! hear!
More like,   
"I'm in first place?"

"Of course"
I usually end up first in Insurgency, so I humbly believe that I'm quite skilled at the game. No competitve mode tho.
Yep, I know how this feels
Its even worse when the shitters think youre a smirf and proceed to meme out/try to be funny and throw the game. Ive had this happen so many times its obnoxious.
This happens to me a lot in War Thunder "I'm not doing great, only got a couple of kills but even so we are getting wrecked that match. Oh, I'm in first place, the top of the enemy team has 12 kills."
Seeing as I'm a pc gamer, loaded up destiny after not playing it (and ps4) since release and was dominating PvP.
My score was higher than the enemy team's top player yet my team was losing. Bearing in mind I had level 20 gear while they had level 40 gear..... How...
If you're first, you ain't last
People seem to think every game revolves around k/d so it's really easy to be at the top of a scoreboard. Yesterday I was top in a BF1 grand operation with 8 kills and 15k score. People need to PTFO and use their meds/ammo more.
I think I'm playing one of my worst matches of all time, look at the scoreboard and I'm #1 on my team.  

Insert meme here.
When I am gold medal in damage and kills with the tank in overwatch
Do you think Donald Trump feels this way about America?
lol me 2 m8
This straight up happens to me in every FPS I play lol and I'm pretty shit xP 
[I refuse to join...](https://img0.etsystatic.com/035/0/8615399/il_570xN.642998540_athf.jpg)
Similar for me in Uncharted 4.  As an older guy (44), when I am in the lead I give the youngsters shit since they are supposed to have the fast twitch responses.
For everyone who has ever received "MVP" in Overwatch, you understand the terrible truth behind this.
Every game :/
I feel this way whenever I get play of the game in Overwatch, especially while playing Mei. I'm less "oh good!" And more "Dear god no one could use their ult worth a damn could they?"
This could also be a veiled attempt to flatter yourself.

Sometimes you just end up being better than anyone playing at that moment on any side.
I am ALWAYS on the team that sucks in EVERY team based game I play.
Me every time I play CoD. 
I do this all the time. I'll think to myself that I'm doing shit, see that I'm the best guy on our team, and think that I must be playing with guys missing a hand or something. 
I'm half blind, and this still happens to me sometimes lol
As a battlefield only player I have never even been close to the top on my new cod game.
At 36 years old im in the top 2.5% of players for my region in CSGO : )
In my experience, nobody ever wins because they're good.
They win because the other team is bad/messed up bigtime somewhere.
Me in Overwatch. *Constantly.*


was playing Overwatch last night as Bastion (a defensive/turret/machine gunner who has a self-healing feature) and got a gold medal for healing... against all the other healers playing. I knew I was on a shitty team... but damn.
i always think this when i come first in COD on a Losing team, dont know if its good or bad but whenever i am in a losing game i come first . On the winning games i come first once a while im mostly third and sometimes second.i Suck lol
This also bothers me when I'm in first on the losing team , it's almost like I'd be a consistent player on the winning team with that favorability
This is me in Overwatch without fail
Yup
Every fucking time:

Every fucking time:

Every fucking time:

Every fucking time:

Etc
Pretty much my entire League of Legends career for years.
"I'M the one in first? Dear Lord we are screwed."
Believe in yourself son. 
The best is when it makes you rage a little inside:

>  What is this *shit*!?  *I'm* #1 on the scoreboard?!  What are these fucking retards on my team *doing?!*  God damnit....

Sobering, but occasionally honest.
Yeah I gotta be honest... I have put in some work to getting a lot better at CS:GO. I routinely top frag and am not surprised. What surprises me is after winning tons of matches, top fragging all the time and getting a ton of MVPs... I still cannot rank up. THAT is surprising. 
Usually the case yeah.
I hate this when I'm actually first on my team and then my team is actually winning too. It's hard carrying a team to the top...
That feel tho when you have that initial reaction, and then check the scoreboard to find that it is a close game where everyone is being badass. You are just the most badass.

Few and far between for me, but oh so satisfying when it happens.
This is what I do in overwatch, I can always tell the outcome of a game within the first minute, if I've got two or more golds we are going to lose 
"I have gold damage and gold elims! My team sucks!"

No they dont, work with the team asshole!
This happens to me in MWO all the time. 750 damage and the only 2 kills for me? Yup... we're gonna lose... 
Silver?
Probably baitin'
Yup. Being average to terrible in many games, taking the number one spot on a team by a wide margin is wholly depressing. 
Everyone I'm leading on my team we are in last 
plays Zenyatta, round ends in a loss, i have every gold medal. We had a Mercy. 
Team shit.  Team russian.  Team peruvian.  Trash team can't even hit double digit kills 13 rounds in.

 Most games are like trying to buy 3rd flash bang.
"You can not carry anymore."

I KNOW I CAN'T CARRY ANYMORE.  I GO 20-40 KILLS PER GAME. SIX TO TEN MVPS. TEAM SHIT, REPORT TEAM.  TEAM MIERDA.  Cyka blyat!  Vote kick me, I AFK spin.
This is literally how I grade everything in my life. "oh, I got into Harvard? I guess everyone must be dumber than I think."
Man, this is pretty much every time I play Rocket League. 
In Halo Reach I would often have 20 kills in a 50 kill team slayer match and my team would still lose. I rarely played with friends. It is amazing what teamwork and communication can do for a team.  Playing solo my win rate was 40%. So much for balance
Honestly though I really struggle to understand why people who go 2/20 and stuff like that still play online. That can't be fun, so why not play bots or something and get better st he game and then play? 
Lol! I think that a lot of people can relate to this.
When I get 4 gold medals in Overwatch but I was playing really poorly in that match...
As someone new to Overwatch, this is how I feel when I get commendations or Play of the Game.
Get rolled playing overwatch.

Get all good metals with 4 kills. 
Like playing with a bunch of snipers in battlefield
Nerd cubed logic at its finest
That's how matchmaking works... learn to play scrub.
Unless you're a beast with gold armor and dark matter 
Same
Every game I play
I'm actually decent at cs but at the level I play at I'm very much a lurk/support player so my top fragging generally means we lose horribly. 
Me on Overwatch, idk what im doing with any character and if i got play of the game and mostly gold medals, everyone else sucks.
What I say everytime I'm top of the team.
After "peaking" at the rank of LE, I bought another account and just troll with my friends. I know it's frowned upon, however, my friends and I know the risks and if in fact we get a ban, well then we'll just wait until the games on sale again. 
Or!!!!!! The other team sucks ass as well as your own 
whoever posted this must be casual as fuck!
So I've had this solid issue where no matter what If I'm top fragger and I dont get 30+ kills I lose.
hahahah so accurate
The reality of FPS or moba...someone has to carry the team in pub ALMOST every game.
30-6-14 and we're down 14-11? Yep
Imposter syndrome
Whenever im first i think "Business as usual"
King of the shit squad. Classic.
I mean, if YOU'RE in first place, they'd have to.
The worst part is when you can't tell if you are having the game of your life or if your team actually does suck that bad. 
Or you know you're performance is horrible then you look at the score and you're at the top? Then you definitely know your team sucks. 
I know this feeling *all too well*.
Story of my gaming life 
Nothing beats the feeling that you get once you realize that you are actually awesome at the game. 

I remember playing Fistful of Frags, and winning almost every single match. I think there were only a few people I ever came across that could consistently beat me, and they were all either devs or played the game in tournaments and had a badge next to their name. 

Then they did a pretty big overhaul on the guns, including severely nerfing the one I was using most of the time, and I lost my skill overnight. Stopped gaming for a while due to life stuff, and now I'm only "pretty good" at the game. 
I'm a really good player but if I'm your best, then Y'all fucked. 
I normally feel that way in games but when I play titanfall 1 or 2, or halo 1-3, I get to be on top and it's pretty cool to be good at something 
It's always a bad sign when I'm in first place... I got carried to my rank anyway.
Playing Titanfall 2 and our team kept losing. Then I realized I was coming in last and not contributing. Then I got better and my team started winning. So yeah, I was probably the OP's teammate. 
Gold damage as Ana with a Soldier on our team... yeah they suck.
Heroes of the Storm: does XP contribution really make you the best on your team?
"I don't care if I'm assault class. I WANNA RIDE THE MOTORCYCLE!"
I can relate!  I like to play the objectives so I tend to get a decent score, but as I'm getting closer and closer to 40, my eyesight and reaction times are really starting to slip.

If I'm in the top 3, my team is shit for sure.
This happens to me in world of tanks as well. If I'm up on kills my team is loosing. 
ITT: Everyone sucks at games
I love it when I'm the best player in the match and my team is losing. Always find something to complain about. I'm not even that good but I can always stay positive.
When I'm Lucio with all 5 golds o.o
Because I'm the worst out of my friends (when I had decent internet that is) I was always the entry fragger and got generally a single kill a round while everyone rushed behind me and did the rest so I never get above mid scoreboard lol.
top and bottom text
 picture =low effort relatable front page             memay
  
In my defense, I only knife; however, I've won plenty of times. 


Every FPS ever
I used to be really good at CS:GO relative to my rank, but now I akways start out on top and turn to shit as the game goes.
oldest fucking meme, who votes that shit up? ^^

In Battlefield 1 64 player servers this is especially true. I truly know I'm damned if I'm in the top 5 on my team.
This is me for Battfield 1. Yesterday I PTFO  and we lost by 170ish on Empires Edge - Conquest. I ended up with 17k final score. Went 20-12. My squad which consisted of 2 people were first in flag caps, defends etc. Look at the scoreboard and the next 7 top guys were 4-1, 3-1 kd ratio but a good 6k + under me. Smh. Stop camping, get out and cap some objectives/support your squad people. 
There is no probably in my book.  I KNOW I suck at PvP.  I avoid it usually.  (Except Titan fall/overwatch...  I love those games!)
How is this front page material? I've seen it more than a dozen times and it wasn't funny the first
If you're rarely first place, you're probably not thay good. 
I'm only ranked Silver 2, and I spend most of my time as the top fragger.... which leads me to believe that the entire ranking system is fucking retarded.
When I was asked to go DPS on my feral druid in early Burning Crusade and compete for top DPS with main specc DPS... 
I've actually kept track of when I play counter strike. Every single time I've been top fragging on my team, and the other team, my team loses. 
Just played Battlefield 4 and got 1st place for the first time. Felt just like this.
This is how it was with me in Titanfall 2 for a while... then next thing you know I'm top of the board on the winning team! I assume the other team is full of 100% monkeys at that point.
How the hell does crap like this get to the top of the front page?
"I'm not in 1st place? Ugh I'd be in first if my team didn't suck."
...then you send the 3 - 19 guy a "KYS" message. Been there bro. 
Am suck. Can confirm.
yeah... I know the feels
By definition if you're in first wouldn't the rest of the team HAVE to be worse than you? 
Of course this always happens. 
This is exactly how I feel in overwatch.  I like it when I'm struggling to get bronze, it means I have a decent team.  I'm honest enough with myself to know I'm a wholly average player.
Nah. I play better if my team is good.

So when I suck, it's because my team sucks.
'bout to play some GO right now ;).. Anyone want to join? HMU
It just a game, take it easy.  Btw, you need to move on to next game though.
Yep im ok at everything i play but i got enough lag to negate every action i try somtimes.  Hide behind corner, still not behind corner.  Shooting, no bullets leave the clip.  But often im on the top of our scoreboard, and it makes so little sence, unless everyone is handicapped like me.
In silver 4 games I topfrag with 40+ kills, but when I rank up to SE midfrag, then I derank. The cycle continues.
I played SW Battlefront today.  8 kills, 19 deaths and top player.  Sometimes, I deserve it, but today it was a true mark of how bad my team was playing (me included) and how good the other team was.
This probably isn't like most cases but in a CS match the bottom fragger on my team was complaining in chat about how whenever he is top fragging the match hes on the losing team and whenever his team winning the match he's worst on the team. To which another person on our team replied, "that means you suck and you get carried through all of your wins by other people."

that kid stopped complaining for the rest of the match.
I play a 3x3 moba. I try to make sure my K/D ratio is better than the worst person on the other team. Win lose or draw if I have the highest K/D rate on my team I am pretty sure we suck. 
Yeh absolutely. I hardly ever play counter strike. I only won 8 competitive matches so far and still I end at the top almost every game. I don't know anything about the game I just walk around with my spraying P90 :P
Every once in a while there will be that one match or round where you may very well be the best player on your team, whether that be K:D or playing objectives correctly while holding your own. Those are scary rounds and usually a loss.
its probably for your happy time
TIL all the bad players on my team comment on reddit.
Either that or you're the best at taking advantage for the other team's shortcomings
Noticed that back in Halo 3. It transferred to CS too (that being said I'm not even close to as good at CS as I was at Halo...). :(
Literally what happens in every game I'm in.
Yeah if I'm on top of the leader board I guaran-fucking-tee my team is going to lose.  Every single time. Been playing csgo since 2013 and have almost 1500 hours of competitive experience, along with 400 hours of surf/kz


500 wins and im still fucking goldnova 1.
No game is more rage inducing.

Also, I love the games with some cunt kid on the opposite team named "DINOSOWER 420 N0SC0P3r pussy destroyer I fucked ur mom XD" and he has some shitty ass anime profile pic and he has like 100 hours in the game, top frags, and hits incredible shots, gets 3ks every round and types "ez" and "bad" in chat. Fucking csgo.

//rant
I remember playing smite and having 21 kills to 2 deaths as a tank.
I call posting this again next week!
This is me every time I have 4 or more gold medals in Overwatch.
I was one of those people who carried teams in some games but still lost because my team was filled with retards. Never fails.

Edit: Or I get labeled as a cheater…. by both my teammates and my opponents
What I feel every time.
But consistency is what I aim for which is pretty hard when you're a casual gamer. 

There are times though "occasionally" when I just gain so much skill that my reflexes and choices are spot on for a period of time.
Then when the novelty wares off it's back to being shit.
I don't get it :/
In Titanfall 2 if I'm leading there's a near perfect guarantee that we're gonna lose. I'm not even bad, sometimes you just can't kill hard enough to keep up with the other team.
Ever since cod4 Remastered came out and my old team is grown and has a life (and a PC T.T) this is my reality
I have the same problem on titanfall 
Mine would be: 

I'm in first place....and it is gone. 
2 kills and 1 death hows my team doing? im at the top how? the other teams top 5 guys have 10 kills each, oh my god we are going to duy
I'm doing the best in my team? Wow this team fuckin sucks!
Why I love that MW3 servers are still up: im consistently in the top 2
Whenever I drop into a destiny PvP match and I'm holding the flag in front, i always think "welp, this teams shit. We're gonna lose." 
This is every MMO team game ever
Every time I win an Arms Race lmao
Especially with a P90
20-2 first half. 26-26 end game. Fuck yeh. 
Or you've just planted the bomb every round 
Gets new personal best K/D ratio, teams end up shitting the bed. 
Whoa dude that was a bad decision.
wow i got 2 kills that round,  what did you do? YOU lost us the round.

I hate NA pugs, someone please swap Russia with USA, please.
Best repost of the year
suck my team
I find this especially true when playing overwatch.
Match ends, I have three golds for Elem, damage and objective time. Would normally be great expect for the fact im playing the guy whos only job is to hold up a shield and slowly walk forward.
I sometimes do this in Titanfall 2, but these days I've started taking the time to see how well I'm doing before I start pointlessly self-deprecating myself. If I've got like 21 kills, then I'm doing an okay job. If I have like 5, the team is probably fucked.
can relate. I fucking suck at csgo but I sometimes manage to get into the first place and when I do I know I'm playing with half asleep blind people because that would be the only way I could be on top
I'm an entry fragger, and can usually get atleast 1, and maybe an assist on someone else.    
If I kill 2, I am happy.    
That being said, I DIE EVERY ROUND.   
and never get points for Bomb plants, so if I am in first ... Well, it means the other team sucks, and I am killing 2-3 on my entries, or my Team sucks, and even though I am only getting 0-1 entry kills, no one else is able to get any more.
I actually got really good at this game, "warhawk". I was best player in every match, got kicked for "hacks" a few times too. 



But if anyone played it as long as I did, I'd probably just be another noob :(
I'm always king of the losers 
Lol
How is that? Cs go got casualized to hell
"My team is losing the match? My team probably sucks"
Don't break my illusion of myself, it's all I have left.
Reached the top of the score board on my team in Titanfall 2 last night for the first time and this was my exact thought.  I'm a realist about my gaming skills.
My K/D in most games is ~1 so if I'm doing better than someone they're probably bad.
No, the matchmaking just sucks.
Cs: first place? My team sucks. 5 v 5
BF1: first place? Im amazing.  32 v 32
Always feel like this when I am playing BF1 or Titanfall. I could be the MVP of the team/game yet still lose the match because my team sucks. 
If you think top fragging means your in first place, you probably suck
Probably using P90 and tec-9
If you're in first place, by definition you're the best player on your team... which means that the rest of your team is worse than you (or is at least doing worse than you)...

So... yeah, pretty much.
Poor OP, always coming in first place. Such hardship.
That's the big problem with a lot of shooters' communities: scores are used as e-peen indicators.

*"Boi, u bettur b4k 0ff, i got 420/0 k;d bich u aint got sh1t on m3"*

~ xXKushWeed69Xx
In Overwatch... Getting gold in eliminations while playing tank or support really shows how much your team sucks. 
I know some games ideas of team balancing are to stick, say, the two best players in the lobby with the worst ones, and then fill the other team with the average neutral scoring players. The idea being that they balance each other out. But more commonly the result is just those two best players out scoring everyone by a big margin yet consistently losing every time.
Bad, overused title.
I had to carry the team as Torjborn 

Thats how bad those mofos were
I would like to know that feel. That's why: does anyone know how I can upgrade my fps performance on my Mac Pro, 8GB RAM,Intel Graphics HD 4000, i7?
I know that I shouldn't be gaming on a mac in the first place. 
Other indication is when you have double the points of the person in second place, happens to me more than often 
I carry teams as a forever silver.  My teammates talk about all these ranks they hit before the reset.  I don't even know what they or I'm talking about and I still carry these kids.
Is this meme moving?
How can you be first place as an individual in a team game? Either your team is winning or your team is losing. Best KD doesn't necessarily mean MVP either, in my opinion. 
I miss PS Home.

You might to able to some help [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/) as well.
Because titanfall 2 been out
If that isn't misleading then I guess we are all free to lie out our asses next time we want a job, promotion, mortgage or whatever. When someone comes back and says "this isn't accurate" just say "no man's sky" and that should resolve it.
Goddamn that phase shift execution is brutal.
Hyyyype!  That phase shift execution is pretty fucking cool, just glad to have ANGEL CITY BACK!
HYPE HYPE HYPE
If only this game had some sort of bot matches
That was awesome
It'll be a simultaneous release with Half life never-gonna-come-out.
Fuck?
Dragon age Inquisition
NG+. I enjoyed it even more the second time around. Outstanding game!!
If you want an intense rpg experience? Go for dark souls 3. i love it! 

But yeah the witcher 3 was great! Simply amazing! The DLCs as well. 
Dragon Age Origins
Dragon Age Inquisition
Borderlands 2 
Assassins Creed
Mass Effect Trilogy 

Borderlands 2 is great if your playing together. 
Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen.  
Any Dark Souls.
Finish DLCs if you didn't already. Blood and wine is simply the best rpg experience I had so far.
Ahhh Legend of Legaia!

The second one is pretty good too.
I used to rent Legend of Legaia while in HS a lot. I haven't thought about that game in a while. Gonna need to get a copy now. 
Man I maxed out the clock on bof3
I've been looking for Jade Cocoon and Star Ocean forever. 
Damn. Legend of legaia. One of the best RPG those days besides chrono cross. 
Vault-Tec approves of this post.
Great job
Am I the only one who began singing the actual song? Lol
Another Reichland needs your help!
Not me, I do the bare minimum and then they're on their own. 
Just like wilshere and reus.... always under maintenance
From what I can tell Microsoft have said from the XB1 onwards everything will be backwards compatible so what ever works on the XB1 will work on the Scorpio as well. Sure there will be exclusives for the scorpio but all your XB1 games will work on it.
The way they have been marketing it(from the little bit I have seen)it is to end console generations. It is supposed to run new games and older games. I don't know if that matters or not.  
I asked this question some days ago and got good answers : you can see them here : https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5fd26d/i_loved_the_cc_games_but_are_there_any_new_great/
My only suggestion would be RUSE, outside of that RTS seems to be a dying genre.
Sadly, it's dead.
Just to add something for thought, you're asking EA to put out a game with infinite replayability, to only be paid for once.
Might give C+C: Rise of the Reds a try.  It's a mod for Zero Hour that adds more factions and missions.
Give the Supreme Commander games a go dude, or if you don't mind going spacey then the updated versions of Homeworld games are good as well :)
If you're willing to get battle net, then Overwatch and Starcraft 2 are great games which have great multiplayer. 
RPG/Action/Adventure: Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Titan Quest, Gauntlet, Hammerwatch

RTS: Civ 5 & 6, Age of Empires 3, Starcraft 2, Dawn of War II, Open RA (Red Alert F2P), Heroes of the Storm (F2P), Company of Heroes 1 & 2. 

FPS: Payday 1 & 2, Dying Light, Vermintide, L4D 1 & 2, Killing Floor 1 & 2, Arma 3

Most of those accommodate or are designed for coop play.
is game special​ in 2016
Eh. It was okay. Game got super boring super fast. Thing I hated the most was that all the car brakes sounded like fan belts when you drifted.
From wiki, it says it is in house studio of absolute entertainment who closed shop in 1995.  Further, it says most employees went on to skyworks interactive. 

Final Fantasy XV​ is my preferences
10 total but 11 last two weeks? I think something went wrong there
Hmm
no sale ..is best game
You figured they'd drop the price to something reasonable. Like $5.
Well... I mean the update was kinda good
Dark Souls Series
Not many games start you out as weak as original Everquest.  It was quite challenging back in the day, and the raid content is still certainly far harder than most modern games.  

Dark Souls is the obvious answer. If you don't mind (very) old games, the Megaman games were downright cruel. Fallout 4, despite all the flack it's getting, does a good job aswell on 'survival mode'. Couple of bullets *will* kill you until you get to a somewhat high level.  

Generally speaking, older games were much harder and less forgiving. I'm sure there's a lot of videos on YouTube on the subject. A search on "Top 10 hardest games" should do the trick.
Survival Horror games, in particular the 'totally defenseless' variety like Amnesia and Outlast.            
                
Also, the beginning of Baldur's Gate, especially if you're playing a magic class. At the start you can cast one or two puny spells before needing to rest, can't hit the broad side of a barn, and die if someone breathes on you. Course that just makes your transformation into badass magical demigod all the sweeter.
I'm betting most of the games in that category would be Survival Horror games. Amnesia, Until Dawn, Outlast. Also Dark Souls, The Last of Us
You'll never feel as underpowered as playing a Dark Souls game where you don't grind or use summon signs. 
Being a fresh level one in any competitive online multiplayer. Fps games, you don't have the unlocks,  better equipment. Mobas, generally you don't have the skill cap or knowledge to counter build. 
SubNautica.  
You are NOT the biggest fish on that ocean planet :)
Gothic 1 and 2 had you quite weak at the beginning and starting a fight with an average dude on the street was usually enough to get yourself beat up / killed.

Good old Nintendo color.
I use to have that, i think, doesn't it have a turbo button?  That thing was the only way I could play a track and field game, not the stadium events one.
With the dress, you lose the ability to wear leg armor, which means you loose 2 slots worth of "deep pocketed" mods and the extra carrying capacity that comes with it.  Not worth it if you pick up all of the things.

No. Sorry.
That's a great question, I haven't found either one to be very active. 
It might be only because I've used Xbox for so long but the party/chat system seems simpler and easier to use on Xbox and the quality seems so much better.
Also, having the LFG system you can find a group of people you've never met to party up with and chat.
I own a PS4 as well but never use my mic (one that came with system) because I just get pissed and not being able to hear anyone well, or them not hearing me.
Again this could be my mic.
But, this is just my personal experience.
i have both consoles and everything is pretty much the same dude but what i can tell you is this ive noticed a higher chance of finding someone with a mic on xbone. but dont exepct it like it used to be back in the day..
From my own experience. People use both. When a group of friends or randoms who played a few games together. They form a chat. Otherwise, just whoever has a mic.
I keep my mic on mute in case anyone needs to actually PTFO.  It's happened only once.  Party chat is usually where my mic gets actual use.
I think the answer is neither. Games seem to have moved away from the whole almost-forced game chat. I remember what you're describing from my days of playing Halo 2, but you're right. Since then everything seems more party-centric. 
Overwatch is a very team based game where it is almost essential that you communicate.
It really frustrates me when people are in a group but are not in team chat. Or you see that there is 6 people in the team chat channel but nobody is talking. 
Please use your mics people.
I'm on ps4 and i would say the probability of getting at least 1 person with a mic is 1/4 games depending on what time of the day you play
Someone rolled a 01 for timing!
I like how the fire completely blocks the exits in the end.
What game is that?  I think I need to play it...
This doesn't look like it plays much like Overwatch, but still looks neat.
Wow, found more awesome info here - https://www.unseen64.net/2011/09/21/the-avengers-cancelled-xbox-360-ps3-pc/
This needs to be pushed up. An amazing idea in an emerging market.
Looks like it would play more like unreal tourny
I know I would pay $60 of my good, hard-earned money for a Marvel hero shooter.

I like the doodles though lol

Hope the cat is okay!
Whenever my friend gets a game without a cover he draws one.
After watching conan play it for a few, I honestly can't take it seriously. I just don't think that ff games are for me, anymore. 
noone cares about ur story title just write cover drawing of ff15
I guess it's an oversaturated market like back in the 80's. For every game coming out it has a hand full of competitor games on the market. Take Titanfall 2, COD: Infinite Warfare, Overwatch and Battleborn. All these games are aiming for a certain gamer who likes an online multiplayer FPS but rarely can gamers just buy all of them, they can either get one or perhaps two. So as far, as the numbers game goes, fewer people bought Battleborn so it dropped its price very quickly in order to make more sales. Overwatch has recently had a massive price drop to accommodate the fact it has more competition and I recently got Battlefield 1 at about half it usual price because its competitors are using the same tactic. If you are a gamer who hasn't bought any of these games yet, it's hard to justify getting the new COD for £50 when the new battlefield, that's only a month old, is down to £28. IMO this over-saturation of the market and multiple platforms can cause lower quality games like we saw in the 80's (this is why ET came out so terribly, it was unfinished and rushed out for market) however, it can also cause a lot of good games and consoles to drop in price so they can compete. It's a pretty healthy business strategy and, as long as game quality remains high, a gamer benefits greatly from it.
Typically once a company makes their money back, they lower price because anything after that is purely profit. 
because the other games have many new games comming out that they drop the old ones because the lost of popularity. only a few will stay up longer
All games go down in price over time. Some more than others. A game not selling too good or just not so popular will be very cheap in a few months. Very good games, like Battlefield, take about 8 months to go down (around the time the next is announced).
Once you get as behind as I am due to going extended periods of time with no gaming at all you can get your next on the list for 10 bucks used at GameStop 
Yeah, DOOM released in May earlier this year. Just picked it up for $15 which is %75 off in less than a year and it received pretty good reviews on top of that.
Not living up to expectations.

I used to live in an apartment right next to fenway park, it was my backyard for years. So when I heard Fallout 4 was going to be set in Boston I was beyond stoked.

Needless to say, that area in and around Diamond City is pretty legit. My apartment complex is visable from the main entrance. A lot of the areas are pretty compressed, but if you have lived in or traveled to boston and can appreciate the surroundings, it truly takes that game to another level. 
Living in the suburbs north of Seattle I doubt I'd ever see my house in any game. However, seeing Seattle done in Infamous: Second Son was amazing. While the recreation was far from accurate, it was still fun to be running around and then seeing something and thinking "I know what that is," or "I've been there."

It's one thing to see something iconic in a video game, like the Statue of a Liberty. It's another thing to see something you can  personally identify with, like someone from New York seeing the statue of Liberty, or in my case, seeing the Space Needle. 
I just played Google Earth in VR on the Vive. I flew to my house. Does this count?
As im not living in a big city that will probably never happen.
I live a block away from the old north church, the North End wasn't perfectly recreated in Fallout 4 but it was still pretty cool to walk to where my apartment should be. 
While playing Dying Light I saw one of my parents Persian carpets hanging on the wall. Same style, colour, everything. Even that horrendous rug survived the end of the world as we know it. 
I tried to in "True Crime: Streets of LA". They recreated the LA area really well, like google maps before street view. It was kind of condensed and there were less freeway ramps, but if you knew how to get to a place IRL, you could get there in game. Except my apartment, it was just off the edge of the map (and in the San Fernando Valley). I was about a mile from where I live when the roads just looped back around and sent you back to LA.
Everybody who lives on Waveland Ave. in Wrigleyville, Chicago
I'm considering watch dogs 2 simply because I'll never see oakland in a game again.  Anyone know if the representation is good? I've only seen Russians streaming it
I was stationed at Andrews Air Force Base for a couple years.  Adams Air Force Base in Fallout 3 was the closest I got to what you're talking about.  It doesn't match the real world base at all, though.

Edit: where I lived is about half the map's width away from where the eastern border ends.
Depends.  Are you a PC gamer or Xbox gamer?  You should be fine with either, but it all depends on if you want the ability to mess with graphics settings on your PC while playing or not have too many options with xbox.  You can presumably play both using an xbox controller.  
To be fair the machine did come out 12 years before he was alive. He's as old as Toy Story, therefore it's not unreasonable to assume he's not heard of it.

But on the other hand, it's the NES. The most famous games console of all time. You'd think he would have seen it somewhere before.

Wow, someone who wasn't alive when something was relevant doesn't know what it is. Call the press
The fact that you use hashtags on Reddit makes me cringe. You sound like the typical bitch that uses hashtags and filters for every post. 

But to stay on topic, he wasnt born around the time the NES was made, and maybe he was unfortunate at the time to not obtain the SNES.

Flyyyyyyyyinnng in the sky! Cliff racer  flyyyyy sooooo hiiiiiigghh!
Those assholes need to be hunted to extinction. 
PC version had a sound clip for medium armor hit that was so fucking loud you'd have to basically mute the game when playing which sucked with cliff racers. i eventually ran the armor hit thru an audio workstation and adjusted the volumes. 

still my all time favorite
WROWRRR chkaWaGYAHGHhgh!

Those sounds still haunt me...
There was a reason one of the first mods released was to remove cliff racers.
I used to have nightmares of these.
What we need is a remaster of this, not Skyrim
I haven't played this game in 10+ years

You sure you didn't get the [Birdemic](https://youtu.be/bu0sy9OG4RU?t=14s) game by mistake? 
I summon my Golden Saint and run.
I remember watching gameplay and trailers of this game on gaming channel (Hyper) and dreaming about playing it. Oh i got shivers when i saw intro first time there. I used to be so impressed by graphic and gameplay, by this enormous open world! This game had its problems. I will remember for the long time quest where i needed to fetch a book, easy task no? but i was thief and i happen to loot that location before and sell the book to random shop ;x Also Vivek city was annoying ;x

Man i miss the hell outta this game and even bought it on the steam sale, but my current computer and steam dont really play well with the game. Cant even start a new game, or install the patches.
Cast a flight for 1 second spell on them.
Expected post about the discracefully annoying flying pests. Did not dissappoint.
Oh god. I feel like I could hear this gif. 
There was a mod that disabled / deleted cliff racers.

It was pretty much essential.
A damage health spell dealing 45+ damage is enough to instantly kill most varieties of cliffracer.
Looks like my experience with monster hunter games haha
How sweet were those Daedric weapons though. 
Oh my God. Reminds me of the Harpy lair in the Witcher 2. 
CLIFFRUNNERS!    FUUUUUCK!   TOO ANGRY NO WORDS....  RAAAAAR!
I created a mod for Morrowind called Lagoon Island (selfish plug). As part of the mod I changed the Cliff Racers agro settings. The only ones that would attack were the blighted ones. That 1 change made the game so much better. Still my favorite game of all time.
Only thing that stands between me and a comfortable flight around vvardenfell
Where's St. Jiub when you need him?? 
yeah uhh i'll pass on this game 
I'm almost 30 and I want to go here so badly.
I will definitely go to Universal just for Nintendo Land.
Yes, Pokemon is coming to Universal. I'm glad they Univeral and not Disney. I feel like Disney can do a fine job, but they have a lot of other great properties already (ie Starwars, Pixar). 
You can feel like you've been transported to your "Game Platform"! i have a feeling like this guy has never played a video game in his life, yet they're having him explain it. (no, im not talking about Miyamoto" 
After seeing what Universal did with their Harry Potter areas in Orlando, I can't think of anyone better to do it. 

They knocked that shit out of the park (and i'm not even that big a fan of the books/movies). 
So are reposts, it seems.
Infinite ammo?
You know how witch hunting was back in the day? Women were accused of being witches because they did stuff nobody else thought was possible only because their knowledge was more advanced of certain fields of expertise.

Most of the cases can be applied to today standards because and especially people online believe everything. So with todays technology you could fabricate a "proof" that someone did something bad and now he will be hunted for it. Is that good? no!

It's not our job to judge people or even, for the lack of a better word, "execute" them that's why witchhunting is not allowed. If you want that something is done with these people, contact the support and provide the video you uploaded unlisted to youtube. If the developers want to have a healthy game they will do something about it. If not, look for another game.

I have quite some time on my back with gaming and I can tell you, raging about dumb fucks will do exactly what they want, to get upset about it. Either block them and look for other players or just play another game. 
You can use controllers on PC too
Like many, I play both. the PS4 gets the lions share of my gaming time, but my PC serves me well for games like Cities Skylines and more recently, Planet Coaster.
I have my PC and an XB1. Don't need to choose one.
I swapped from Xbox to PC about 2 years ago. Mostly playing FPS's. 

It's not as hard to swap as you may think. I swapped at first playing things such as Fallout and that helped me get used to how the mouse feels with shooting. I moved quickly into Call Of Duty and CS:GO with relative success at first. (Grew over time) and now playing games like Overwatch my accuracy is as good as it ever was playing on Xbox. 

If you're very worried about it, if you're not playing competitively then a controller will suit you fine, though it will still take some getting used to and yes, most people will be a lot faster than you. 
Just practice a lot. 
I did the reverse, PC to console, I am getting better with the controller, but I can't honestly finish any game without auto-aiming a little. Well, maybe DOOM (played the demo only) 
PC4life,
I made the switch to play overwatch on Pc, it has taken a couple of months but now it feels completely natural, I went with a mouse with quite a few buttons as I felt the keyboard was the hard part.
I switched from a Sega Genesis to a 486. Does that count?  :P

Fuck I'm so miserable 
wat?
If you remember MGS3 the long ladder climb, so idea was to making it in GTAV :D
Dishonored
from that list and that time limit, i'd go to faster action games like dishonored or doom, rather than deep exploration games like the others.
Divinity will be a long haul I suggest dishonored if you don't want to do a good karma gane
Witcher DLC or Dishonored. 

Normally I'd be all for Fallout 4 but depending on your play style, it may take about 6-8 hours to get to Diamond City which is where the game actually starts picking up (without giving away too much). 
If you don't have time to delve deep into a game with lots of story I would say def play Doom. If fast paced shooters aren't your thing I'd say play Fallout 4 as 2nd choice.
8GB is high-end, not sure why people say this, I have 4GB RAM, and I can run a majority of games.
I don't think so because teens can play all of the games from that have ever come out, and some of my favorite games came out recently(skyrim, bioshock infinite, Witcher 3, cs:go)
I do feel bad for the massive amount of DLC and "extra content" that needs to be purchased to enjoy a full gaming experience but lots of the games I played in the 90's were shallow and repetitive so it's a horse a piece. Those games are still available and nostalgia is fucking on fire right now. So I don't think they missed much.
I think a big difference now and then is the challenge. Think of  half life and unreal they were challenging and long winded games, how many fps have campaignes longer than ten hours now days? not to mention our mmos went from asherons call and everquest to max level in a week.

you won over gamers with gameplay in the 90s not graphics (though at the time they were incredible on my voodoo 2) also into consideration, nothing is really new anymore. the 90s and 80s had a chance to come up with new ideas now days its all rehash, not because they are not inventive but how many ways can you ride a bike?

edit: dark souls is really the only game i think i can say i dig deep into anymore, more so because it takes me back to my boy and his blob nintendo hard days.
I wouldn't say it's the "shit era" of gaming. I think it's just because that's what you grew up playing and the nostalgia and all that. Wait until this generation grows up and will be saying "back in the day on my PS4...."
Take off the nostalgia glasses.  I grew up back then and it wasn't some perfect age of gaming.  Bad games got made then too.
This is subjective and nostalgia plays a huge factor in this. PS3 has/had some bomb ass games that I arguably enjoyed more than the games I played on N64 or Gameboy (sans Pokemon). 


Anyone 'member the general etiquette in TFC? Sniper dueling usually resulted in a bevy of "NS"s. I still remember some shit talking, but it seemed like it was less frequent, and I saw a lot more end of round "GG"s. And of course the awkward enemy spy on your sniper deck that you drill right in the face as he stares at you, practically imploring you not to. You both had a laugh in the chat, and kept going.

If I had to pick a tipping point for the death of friendly gaming, I'd say maybe CS Beta 6 fostered a generation of vitriolic little shits. Also, the era of hackusations (though it was a very real problem in B6).

Such a great game, but its such a heavy time investment that I can never get around to beating it.
Stop playing those kinda games.
They feed off of you.  That's why they started teabagging,  they want your dirty response. 
Play some single player games.
Probably could think about some therapy, sounds like you could use an ear to listen while you work through some anger issues. Don't knock it, therapists aren't for "crazy" people they just want to listen and offer techniques to deal with life better
So essentially, GTA IV on PC is playable now?
Why don't you remove GFWL from GTA 4 and GTA 4 Episodes Rockstar?? :(

It's just you and Fallout 3 in my library now.
They couldn't of removed the abysmal GFWL then.

I prefer Skyrim.

I tried really hard, but I could never get into Fallout the way I wanted.
Skyrim is a lot more free also fallout 4 is the worst fallout game so you would probably also love 3 or new Vegas 
No contest. Skyrim, for the simple fact that you can have Thomas The Tank Engine dragons and shit.
It's a shame this game didn't have a coop story mode. 
You mean in-game chat? Use the xbox app and just start a party with him. That's what I do with my xbl friends works fine. I hardly ever use in-game chat

Bull, still no sandworm
The Advertising Standards are such a joke. This guy, mister "mind blow" lied to us straight in the eyes.
What the hell was this game even about and is it really as bad as everyone says?
Obviously. What did people expect? The real world is based on doing business, it doesn't care if children are angry or can hold a grudge for 4 months for a video game.

If all the teenagers with an internet access start screaming and no serious people are there to hear them, do they still make a sound?
Ads over reached what was in the box.  The game itself I enjoy. 
Next time please do a Screenshot a filmed display is just not great 
The computer has a video in? If so what kind of computer is it?
You do realize you don't need your PS4 right next to you to remote play... right? Could have just left it at home in sleep mode and just taken your computer and Duelshock to school...

Oh, disk 2. Woops.

Alright, Disk 1.

Oh, right. Have to clean it.

There we go. Time to play the game! My save is still here.

God damn it.
You don't miss CD gaming, you miss your youth like all of us.
Going to honest, I personally like physically media over digital download when I have the option. The main is when the day comes that Steam, Xbox Live, PSN, and the like shut down then we would be screwed if we ever need to redownload them or if they require connecting to a sever to even load. Also the issue licensing where if the license expires then you still wanted to buy the game, if is digital only you just screwed. Also don't forget for many people have to deal with data limits (I had a 250GB limit for and I just recently had the option to get unlimited for an extra $60 a month), so yeah you got a good deal on something like Call of Duty Infinite Warfare hope that's the only thing you wanted do with your Internet that and the whopping 130GB was worth it. I know buying digital is more confident but I still prefer physical. 
Possibly the only post I've read all day that made sense.

I'm glad video games help you with your depression. I've learned more from them than school. It helped me get through personal stuff too.
I deal with depression and panic disorder as well. I have found gaming to be the only effective outlet that lets me turn off my brain and have a little peace. Definitely can help some. 
Gaming really does help you get away. Been dealing with head shit more than half my life, and my consoles throughout the years have been a mandatory tool for coping.

I'd been wanting to replay this for a while and just finished it this morning. Back in '03/04 I never finished it. I got to the submarine level and said fuck it. 

Now replaying it 13 years later on PC I've enjoyed it as much as I did the first time and all in all it held up pretty well. 

Ubisoft... finish the story or at least offer this on Steam or Uplay. 
awesome game, i remember playing it on one of my friends pcs. sick artstyle definitly deserves a sequel!
Taht game was so fucking good.
awesome comic series too, should check them out
i just finished this game for the 1st time yesterday fuck its awesome working my way through some ps2 backlog 
This may be the first "sequel please" post I've ever upvoted
>Ubisoft sequel pls.

One of the lesser used statements in this world.
My favourite thing about this game was that you could take people hostage or pick up everyday objects as weapons like chairs
thanks. now i want to kill mongoose again 😎
Yes please👍
Where is my sequel Ubismooth? This game was one of the best ones I've ever played!!
even a re-release! I have this for my Mac and i used to have it for PS2, one of my favorite FPS games to run through
Ubisoft's XIII license is invalid which is why it got removed from GOG. I dont think they ever make a new one ever again.
Loved this game. Liked the little comic book kill cam.

What game is this from? 
I swear, people complain about the controller and completely ignore that Xbox styled controllers exist on both PS3 *and* PS4
Well an Xbox One S and PS4 Pro both run 4K "boosted" but I believe the S might not run it in 4K, just streaming. So don't quote me on that. Everything I've read on the PS4 Pro doesn't show me enough improvement. 
I own both, and I have huge hands. I will never understand how the DS4 doesn't fit peoples hands. 

But I have FFXV on PS4, can't comment on the Xbox version. But honestly I play my S just as much and you can never tell that much difference.

This game looks sweet! Might actually pick it up. Worth it?
Repost from Dark Souls 3 launch day.
Maybe I'm just being a snob, but this looks kinda staged.

If they had entered the boss area, which they were so close to, the phantom would have vanished, wouldn't he? So why even bother looking for the invader?

Why didn't they get suspicious over that chair that's literally blocking their way that has never been there before? It's not that it's in a room or anything, it's noticeable af.

Why did they even rush to the elevator in the first place? And ended up being just so conveniently close to the pit as if they were asking for it.
*boop
I thought the spell was called soul scream at first, now I'm sad it's not
[Why you linked this as a PNG is beyond me.](https://i.imgur.com/3iPHMRk.gifv)
What spell is he using 
That was pretty awesome. Did not see it coming.

It's surprising how much this works. I use it on invaders all the time. The statue version in Anor Londo is just too damn good. 
And that's why you pan the camera around. That's their own fault.
So i heard Dark Souls is coming to vr. That would be insane.
Is that sorcery being *actually* effective in DS3?
It's amazing how easy it is to trick people with chameleon. Such a delightfully dickish way to PVP. 
Cause it's easy... and it does a lotta damage.
I have no idea of Dark Souls but didn't that chair look crazy suspicious and out of place? 
I actually got me and my mates in one session and we played hide and seek using this.
Now that's my kind of mage.
Stupid that you can miss the opportunity to even get this spell... was kinda pissed when i started seeing videos of it and thought about how to get it.... then it was impossible...

Looked legit to me

old, but still funny :))

This reminds me of Warhammer online where you could take potions to turn into a deer, and I met a guy once who was posing as a dear in the enemy zone (pvp server) surrounded by other animals. I was running by and did a double take, since he was clearly larger than other deer and when I attacked him it turns out it was an enemy faction. 
The new prop hunt game has great graphics

When did darksouls become prop hunt?
That reminds me of the Polymorph spell in vanilla Everquest. I believe they changed what you could do with it, but originally you could polymorph into just about any object. For example, you could drop a copper coin and then polymorph yourself to look like the coin. So you could just hang out in Freeport all day taunting people when they try to pick you up.

Never finished dark souls. It was fairly easy but just so poorly made. But this makes it look a lot more fun than it was for me.
Am I the only one around here who's only experience with team based online shooters is that every one is on a team of 1 man armies? Where kills are more important than caps or objectives. Where revives, ammo drops, cover fire and backup are a myth. Maybe in games like Arma...
Objectives in multiplayer? Why hasn't anybody told me about this before? SQUIRREL!
One YouTube video I watched earlier described it basicallh like this: Games made in the West portray guns/weapons as a tools, while games made in places like Japan show it as an extension of oneself. Kind of simplified.
A summary of Japanese vs. American guns in gaming:

East: I dislike it, but must use this to survive.

West: LOOK AT MY GIANT METAL PENIS WOO YEAH
East = Japan

West = USA

Is that what youre saying? Ignoring everything between those 2?
Part of it is the design of the buildings.  Quite often, they bury the Protectrons deep inside of the buildings so you basically NEED to clear most of the building before activating.
Great source for enhanced circuit boards, copper and steel.
I never understood the reasons for selecting the personalities of these Protectrons. 
I do it before in survival all the time, everytime (very good distraction for enemies). But in non-survival i do it if they're legendary
Reminds me of Deus Ex. 

"OH sweet a crawlspace, time to get around these guards"

"aaaaaand I'm back at the entrance."
Finds Protectron at the beginning of area, turns on for distraction, player kills the one turret in the area, protectron doesn't like it when you kill its family, protectron proceeds to make it more and more difficult for you to live down your life choices by continuously butt raping you
In Fallout 3, the challenge lies in not protecting the Protectron, because fuck me if it can kill anything at all besides radroaches and maybe critting a ghoul before it gets killed.
I stopped activating those fuckers when one decided to take issue with me killing raiders, right after it had just helped me kill some raiders. 
> Whom

ftfy
I used to activate them as distractions/decoys but I wouldn't always check the personality mode and ended up having to fight them anyway.
Turn them on so the baddies don't come back and take it over 
I'm still confused about why their bodies keep giving me a +5 RAD/s infliction everytime I come near them. Frigging sucks because I like having them cover my rear in buildings. 
I activated the po po at Jamaica plains literally the worst idea ever seeing as they aggro all the ferals in the area, I never knew there were so many god damn ferals, so much for my survival playthrough
Vault Tec hated that.
I like to pretend the Protectron will work for me by keeping the place safe after I'm gone. I wouldve loved to have a protectron in a settlement just pacing around keeping watch.
i did it in fallout 3 in the subway once, it asked for my subway pass, then promptly killed me.
I kill them for the scrap and exp.  
Until this day I am still trying to give my subway token to it, haven't worked yet.
Is that Fisto?
I always just activate and immediately kill them for scrap. They hardly ever make it out of their storage bay - only if there's more than one.
My issue with these guys is that they are too damn slow and inefficient at killing shit.
Does anyone else just mash E on them to hear their voice? I always thought it had a sweet rhythm to it. Protect AND serve. Protect AND serve...
I always wind up getting attacked by the stupid things eventually anyway so I just leave them alone unless I want to kill it. 
And if you do manage to find them quickly they're dropped by the first baddy they contact. 
Whom.
Am I the only one that finds the terminal connected to the sentry turrets only after I have destroyed them all?
If you want to see something super cool shoot both legs off any robot in the game, they'll drag themselves along the ground with their arms and they'll be pissed.
These things are practically walking bullet magnets, they don't help at all.
They always just go right for attacking me. Every time.
The same goes fur turrets, panels are often in such a weird places that you have to wreck them first to hack them.
For real guys?..  What the fuck game is this.... 
Anyone else think they were called Protectotrons for the longest time? 
*whom
Good to see [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3vi65w/to_protect_and_serve_who/) is still making the top page.
*whom

easy way to know which to use.... if the answer to the question can be "her / him / them" it is whom.

if it is "he / she" it is who

To protect and serve who? She? nope

To protect and serve whom? Her? yep


Protectron: What is my purpose?

Me: You grant exp when I destroy you.

Protectron: oh my god...
I try to make it a point to sneak through and activate them. It's always fun to watch them shred through some unwelcome squatters. 
Most accurate meme ever.
Or you do get that rare chance to activate one and then you end up hitting it with an explosive and Aggro it. 
I use the piercing perk to kill them inside their protective home base, and then "activate" them.
every time I activate them with enemies nearby they start attacking me. I don't trust robits
*whom
When I do they always fucking turn on me.
And then they aggro to you for some reason
I don't always repost gaming memes. 

But when I do it's just a couple weeks after it was already on the front page. 
I don't always activate Protectrons, but when I do, it's so I can instantly kill them for the XP. 
I always wait till I kill everyone. I find that they normally don't help and die quickly. I want to bring it back to life so it can stay alive, not die, God dammit. 
That's why I activate them for the sole purpose of killing them for fusion cores.
Overide VIP Protocol:> Army of robots to follow you around.
I always activated them and then charged on ahead. Nobody is gonna hurt my lil buddy!
The TRUTH.
I still have no idea how to get them to stop attacking me. I freed that ungrateful motherfucker and he attacks me every time.
I do this in Skyrim with re-animating bodies. I never think to do it until after I've killed the Draugr Death Overlord.
I always activate them, I feel kinda bad for them being stuck in those pods for so long without as much as a firmware update. 

I know they're robots and don't have emotions or anything, but I mean...what if they did and we just assume they don't?  I'd rather they wander the halls aimlessly for the rest of time instead of stuck in shutdown limbo, wondering what they did to deserve this lonesome fate. 

...also it helps to have them activated because I'm sure Preston will be sending me back later to wipe out yet another horde of ferals.
Someone else will inevitably be sending you to the same location soon enough, and it'll be safer for having activated them...
I just shoot em while they're trapped inside their little pods. If I don't they always want to attack me as soon as I free them. Either it's a glitch in the matrix or I am Terminator 2 Arnold Schawrzenegger
Whenever I activate one even if I have the subway token they attack me. I just never bother with it.
Can we stop with these reposting accounts?
You know there is an opportunity for some cool loot for a quest. "Remote Protectron Hacker/Activator". Make it some sort of area of effect device. 
Survival mode definitely changed my approach to this. I didn't care about protectrons aside from activating and looting legendaries. I'd usually fire them up just for fun but aside from being a handy lure for the occasional hidden feral they don't do much. But early levels in survival a protectron is a godsend. I remember being super cautious and afraid sneaking into the grocery store to get to the protectron going so it could start pulling ferals for me.
I like these guys so I activate them after its safe.
And then I kill the protectron too
You see Protectrons.  I see free circuit boards.
Don't you get cryo ammo if you activate them as firefighters?
people who long died
Staarted a survival mode game recently. After activating a protectron and letting it murder some raiders for me, it then murdered me. I was not happy.
In one save I have three legendary protectotrons roaming around a grocery store.  On occasion I go back to watch them decimate newly spawned enemies. 
Put me on Doctor they heal.
I can think of at least two places OTTOMH where that's not true:  Fanueil Hall and the Suffolk County Charter School.
The protectron parade was nice. Watched them kill a deathclaw. Then when I tried to help I accidentally hit one of them and they turned on me. I'm so sorry my friends :(
Whom
I activate them for the xp, kill them for loot if they're hostile, or let them live if they're not.
'what is my porpoise?' Turning you on gave me some exp soooooo. glwithexistencekbye

Edit: spelling
the ones in nuka world kill more fuckers than the companions.

Maybe because of the new design, I've become really attached to protectrons in Fallout 4. They're too cute, I don't want to fight them.
It's because Bethesda is bad at game design.
Oh lord...THIS!
Calm down there. 
Finally! For the first time -ever- in the franchise, the end product lives up to the expectation!

Now we will be able to enjoy Final Fantasy as it was meant to be played all along.

Thank fuck for that!

I've seen it on mobile too but only played it on PC. I would recommended it, 10/10
It's really great on the iPad too. One of my favorite iPad games for sure. It definitely reminds me of playing the original Rainbow Six (and Rogue Spear!) back in the day and planning everybody's moves in advance and then executing. So much satisfaction...

It's nice to just lay on the couch and take as much time as you want planning out every little movement/flashbang/breach and then hit a button to watch it all unfold.

Waiting for the pyramid to open and daft punk starts playing. 
This looks like a scaled version of the Madrid, Spain Pac-Man Christmas tree.

This version looks a lot better than the Madrid version, though. In Madrid, Pac-Man looked really strange and a few of the images were  kind of animated, but it looked terrible.

CSGO, popular and gets constant updates.
Paladins is a fun free alternative to overwootch
Dude, check out Planetside 2! Such a unique and awesome game. Just look up a few videos. Maybe search for Wrel. He is one of the devs on the game and has a channel. It's free to play and it's not pay to win. It's a MMO FPS and you get everything from infantry to air combat and vehicle combat. The fact that it's MMO makes it a bit of a real time strategy game also when you lead platoons full of squads. It truly is something to experience and you will laugh your butt off at the funny things that happen sometimes :P  
If you like Overwatch, Paladins is a great option. TF2 is great too. You also have competitive stuff like DotA 2 or other MOBAs. 
DoTA or League of Legends

Assuming the PS1 works. I'd say get that.
PS1 was a classic. If you can get a working one and they dont have it, its a pretty good addition
PS1. IIRC you can download and burn games to a CDR and play them without much hassle
I'm honestly willing to give it another shot after this update. Feel like the game just needed more time and we all just go too hyped up and had to have it as soon as possible. I'm gonna give it another shot

Also, nice user name

I must have missed this DLC.
I don't see the problem in modern RPGs, but in the static Open-World-Concept in modern games. In a linear game you can come back to an old place you visit, the developers knowing you are coming back and can react to the actions in the game, but in a Open-World, the developers can't get every resident in the entire world, the possibility to react to every action and  decision you've make, because of an limited budget.

There are two kind of games in my opinon, the first one represents the journey, like in Final Fantasy X, and the exploring of the world, like in Skyrim. I don't think both elements will ever get together, so don't blame modern games, but the gamers that buy so many of them, because they prefer the exploring. 

If you want a good story, read a fantasy book, watch a movie or a series. If you want an experience of the entire world, play a modern game, but don't except that you are the chosen one, that everbodys remember. There are too many chosen ones in this industry. ;)
Morrowind and Skyrim have different protagonists with different backgrounds which influence their character development and sway in the world.

In Morrowind, its never actually confirmed you are the true Nerevarine. While you are eventually named Nerevarine by Azura, its never actually confirmed you are the actual reincarnation of Nerevar, its kinda just assumed you are, because you fulfilled the feats of Nerevar.

As well, the Nerevarine really doesnt have any special abilities. It was only really a checklist of feats that anyone could eventually fulfill with enough prowess. In fact, on the second prophecy, you actually fake by finding a cure for corprus. So, you arent in fact, a supernatural being who "makes corprus fly".

In Skyrim, you are the true Dragonborn, almost without doubt. You can shout and absorb souls. You cant fake that prophecy the way you find a way to fake the Corprus immunity in Morrowind. Skyrim sets you up to be this greater than normal being with supernatural abilities and kinda writes your destiny to begin with. Its probably the reason why you dont need to "Earn it", because Morrowind focuses on a very different set of circumstances from Skyrim.

I think its less to do with new games trying make you "earn" your legacy and more to do with a shift from very personalized roleplaying stories to more grandiose, "i secure the fate of the world" type stories.

Morrowind allows you to make a personalized story, where you can even break prophecy. Skyrim is more the "Hey, your Nord Jesus, do your fucking job and stop Alduin".
Thoughts on The Witcher 3?
I mean in skyrim there is the dragonborn quest where you fight cultists that claim you're not the real dragonborn. Also they don't treat you like dragonborn until you absorb a dragon soul, which Ulfric can't do. Anyone can shout but dragonborn consumes a dragon soul. But baseline I agree with your arguments
Some RPGs still follow that "earn your place" philosophy, the Etrian series comes to mind.
Not new but if you havent played Gothic series then I recommend playing them if you are into RPGs, personally I think the world of Gothic is a lot more alive and lifelike (not in graphical way) than any other RPG game, I loved exploring the world for hours, the game is super brutal in the beginning though.
You seem under the impression that it's easy to put both aspects into one game. What game have you made, designed, or even worked on that does both, even if not well?
What's on their head? 
very nice
Ah yea, phasin out while hangin with my pal Billy Idol..
Teleporting as in lagging? Or cheating and actually teleporting somewhere else?
I was literally just playing it.  It was mostly fine for me.  Ping was about 30 as well my game was playing 90 fps and I only have a $150 graphics card.
Sounds like you're getting hella packet loss. Playing on wifi?
I get about 10-20 ping on pc, runs fine for me
*You're out of your fuckin' mind.*

Okay, really, I'd say you should keep playing through them, since it's not a terribly long series and you can experience some pretty intense or even memorable moments. Who knows, maybe you'll appreciate having gone through the games before Episode 3/HL3 comes out ^^^when ^^^you ^^^retire.

Being a bit more empathetic about why you're not enjoying it as much as you expect, I suppose the style of narrative might be lost on you at the moment, which is a shame, but understandable, given how successful games do it today. There's nowhere near as many fleshed out features in Half-Life 2 compared to other titles today. To name some, there are few to no actual choices, it's a very linear experience, and pretty much no character development or interaction. They kind of just speak at you, but that part is intentional and key to how the player is immersed/involved in the Half-Life games.

Given those things, I think it'd be delusional to expect that everyone will love Half-Life 2 or the series in general, especially as time goes on.

But yeah, I'd say press on, speaking as someone that loves the series but does not consider the games necessarily better than current titles, who have had more than 12 years to perfect upon a very well-explored genre of games.

Edit: To actually answer your question, I'd say, yes, it certainly gets better through the Episodes. Rather epic, in fact - don't you care about why Humanity lost the war? Or what happens to the resistance's efforts/plans? I suppose you have to take the time to dig a bit for a story in your surroundings. It really isn't shoved down your throat like some titles today.
Half life 2 was a game I couldn't play for longer than 2 - 3 hours at a time because I didn't want to make myself dislike the game from boredom. I came back to it once a week for 2 - 3 hours then played something else.
The episodes are much better than the main game. Once you play those you'll understand why people want a hl3 so bad
Half life 2 is one of my very favourite games of all time but I kinda hated it at first, I think for the same reasons you're giving here. I expected that first chase sequence to go on for maybe five minutes and yet it goes on foreverrrrrr. I probably started liking it a lot more at about the point you get the car but there are still some decent stretches of gameplay between story moments after that. Still, after the car sequence I feel even the gameplay parts get a little smarter and more varied.

Still, what will really let you know if you should continue playing is if the few story sequences so far have done anything for you. If you haven't much cared for the characters and the artistic style of the game you might as well quit now. If you've really liked the characters and environments but are just frustrated by how long the stretches of gameplay between them are then you should definitely stick with it. While the game never becomes quite as cinematic and linearly guided as a modern game like Uncharted or something, the pacing does tighten up significantly toward the end and features far more real meaningful character interaction. 

Like I said I myself got very frustrated at that long trek early on but after completing the game I can't say I would change any part of it. After meeting back up with my crew I really felt the relief and fatigue of a guy who'd fought across the whole damn country to get back to them, if Gordon's journey had just been told in a 60 second cutscene it wouldn't give the same power to anything that comes after.

You still have a car journey and a fight through an old facility to go but stick with it through that part at least and wait until you meet back up with Alyx. I think that's the point everything came together for me.
its a good game, but the physics of the series always give me a headache

The bomb code can actually be found written on [defuse kits](http://no-steamserv.ru/uploads/posts/2016-06/1465045039_575286e25b6fb.jpg).

Yea, I just thought that the currency in Pokemon was just based on the value of Japanese Yen, or something near it. makes sense as a 1200 priced meal is around $11-12 when converting.

Edit: those cheap bastards.
I know this was meant as a joke, but what if Looker is our dad?  He did wash up on a beach in Hoenn with amnesia.
sorry to say this but according to [this](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/11/03/currency-converter-calculating-video-game-exchange-rates.aspx) this isn't that much

So if my math skills don't failed me at this one he gave you money around 900$
Your dad is the Doctor?
If the basis of this money is Japanese Yen, then that's only ten thousand dollars. 

A hundred yen is a dollar in American money, so yeah.
I've always played it off of the Yen, so roughly move the decimal 2 places and you have the dollar. 
We're gonna build a wall and the Ultra Beasts are gonna pay for it! We've got a lot of bad hombres coming out of that wormhole!

It will only accommodate single slot cards, and they'll have to be short given the lack of clearance between the PSU and drive bays. It also has a weird form factor for its PSU that will be difficult to upgrade. It's a pretty bad buy for gaming.  
Have you ever played Battlefield 1? The sounddesign in this game is outstanding.
Battlefield usually has great sounds, but honestly for me right now nothing beats Overwatch. Each weapon has a different sound, hell each character makes a different sound when they walk or jump. I can usually tell who is shooting or about to run around the corner just from that. The fact that they are each so different is what makes it impressive.
Destiny is pretty unique in their weapon sounds 
Nothing comes close to firing a machine gun on Argonne Forest in BF1.
This is probably the nostalgia talking but for me its an old original xbox game by criterion called Black. That game was gun porn. 
Pretty much every battlefield game ever lol
SOCOM used to have the best / realistic. They would go record the sounds at a firing range. Loved the sounds the bullets made as they hit the flak vests. I think a lot of new games use this technique now.  
Certainly not new CS:GO sounds lol
I love Classic unreal tournament weapons
The Greek gods are sorta dicks.
It's a tricky one. If you look back at all Greek Mythology, you will find that all figures have their flaws, and all seem to do what they think is right for them. Obviously, we are meant to like Kratos as the protagonist of the story (and one of the most influential characters in gaming history), however, whether he is the bad guy and Zeus is the good guy is up to your interpretation and moral values I guess. Is he just trying to fulfil his own selfish goals, without consideration to how many mortals die? Again up for debate.
IMO, if you truly want to know and understand the whole story, you must play all the games. 

If you don't want to do that, watch this video:

I haven't played since bf3 so excuse my stupid question. From all the clips I've seen it looks like long range shots have been made massively easier. I remember making shots like that and having to aim a hundred feet or more above my target. Yes, no, I'm crazy?
~~People like you are the worst.~~

Scouts should be Periscoping 95% of the time, Flaring 2% of the time, actually helping clear an objective from their perch 2% and popping out to blast the unmoving oblivious idiot 1% of the time, all from, at most 200m away. 

All other Scouts are useless.

What game? 
I have a 4K TV and a PS4 Pro how can I share this screenshot in better quality?
27inch 144hz (BenQ XL2720z V4) ,  size doesn't mean much to me as long as I set it up right for viewing distance with my chair.  Came from a 32inch Led 1080p tv before  this monitor
I prefer larger monitors. I'm currently using a 34" ultra wide one and if possible I'd get an even larger one. 

However, I'd prefer a smaller ultra wide monitor to a larger 16:9 one. This is all purely preference though of course.
Bigger the better. Not that i can say much, with three 19 inch monitors; i guess quantity makes up for small size.
I have 3 27 inch triple monitor setup but only use one for gaming. Only use the triple setup for game development.

My friend has a 55 inch monitor he uses to play DOTA, but his nech is paying the price by looking at the minimap all the time.

I believe 24-27 inch is perfect for most games, but for playing Rocket League or blur or couch coop games you cant beat a large screen or a projector setup.
I use 24 inch ASUS monitors and my BenQ before those was also 24 inch. It's all about preference really. 
It's all about personal preference and viewing distance.  Obviously if you sit very close to a 40" TV and try and play an FPS on it then you will be much worse than someone who has a smaller monitor and sits the same distance or someone who sits further away from the same size TV.

I use a 27" for gaming and have a 24" each side of it which I only use for software development.  I like to sit very close to my monitor so I think that 27" is my absolute maximum at the viewing distance I sit before I start to miss things due to the screen size.
Dildomon used harden!
I love the writing in this game. Its full of innuendos 
Is that a dead pixel around the center of your screen?
Nintendo games?
Tearaway on the Vita?
Creative mode minecraft is my go to for this purpose. 
Terraria, Magicite, Pixel Piracy, Overwatch, any LittleBigPlanet game. 
no. Honestly I don't think it can.
no, unless they find a way to make exploring the ~~randomized~~ procedurally generated content more interesting. but that would require them to add in thousands and thousands of more unique assets for a better variation of planets and critters. so far right now from what I've played, it's like i'm landing on the same planet over and over and over again.  i've played considerably smaller games before that gave me a more satisfying exploration experience than this.

similiar to it's case, regardless of what they call their process of producing contents in their galaxy, the thing that makes playing randomized maps on arpg games like d3 and torchlight 2 is not the maps, but the loot and character progression. no man's sky is basically that, minus the legendary loot and power creep. so yeah, i'd take a 1000x smaller handcrafted galaxy/space than a computer generated content as large as this. this is nothing but another case of daggerfall. witcher 3 and soulsborne series already proved that meticulously crafted world provides a much better experience when it comes to exploration.
If they add multiplayer, proper animal behaviour, an actual story (not the centee of the galaxy is NG+!!!!)and basically most of what was promised, sure.
 No, it matters not how far the game comes post launch. The developers actions were completely unacceptable, and they should not be rewarded for this at all.
I feel like even if it was there's been so much hatred spread around about it that few would give it a chance
I refunded mine. Only way I would ever consider repurchasing is if they implement a LOT of new features and drastically reduce the price. I don't see either of those happening, and even then I probably wouldn't get it out of spite. I gave the game more than a fair chance and it was just dreadfully boring. The ending was a real kick in the nuts too.

"We see you have grinded for dozens of hours to reach the center. None of that grinding was remotely enjoyable after the first hour. Why don't you start all over again?"
I think that this new update has actually given some tangibility to the game, you can see where they are taking the game. I feel bad that there was so much pressure for them to release early, having said that they should have been honest about what they had made. I feel like if it gets a few more solid updates like this one it could very well be a really fun game.
If everyone gets to kick Sean in the balls then ...maybe; if he actually fixes it to meet his wild bullshit lies.

Shut up and take my money!

"Minor performance optimizations" This may be interesting to try out.
Woo I'm excited for this! I hated the work around I had to do for the stupid 2GB RAM bug.
GTA 4 is still being updated?
I owned GTA IV+EFLC back when GFWL was a thing, but now that it's down, anyone have a clue how I can download it again? I tried all sorts of compatibility mode tricks to run GFWL, but even after I manage to sign in, the Downloads tab shows an error while refreshing (servers down I guess). Did they really not bother shifting the game licences to Xbox Live or whatever they replaced GFWL with?

(I probably have the disk somewhere, but I'm wondering if it's possible to download it digitally or somehow retrieve my licence or something)
this also happens to me every so often, you can normally tell if this bug is going to happen because the music stops playing.
Only fix I have found is to save the game and restart the PS4 and even that tends to only be temporary.
Pretty sure BattleBudgie is the MVP of this screenshot.
Love the Grateful Dead avatar, I use one too!
I have that exact Grateful Dead patch on the jacket I'm wearing right now!

4 of my friends recently changed their gamertags to Morgetfog, Mogetfrog, Mogretfog, and Mrogetfog to troll me. They also changed their gamer pictures to be the same. It was incredibly confusing the first time they joined my party and I will admit I had mixed feelings about it. But now it is incredibly satisfying playing in the same squad on battlefield,  especially if several of us make the board at the end of the round. Even when we all die to the same person it feels wonderful just thinking about the level of confusion he must have about his kill feed.

Dude, no! I totally forgot about it. That's so awful. He just doesn't notice how annoying he is. 
I want to make a mean joke but at least he has friends 😔
If this game was new I would say "good reason to never buy it"  but i remember doing things like this to play max payne on windows 10 
Why does it say that your best time is 57 seconds if you just completed it in 28 seconds? 
That's a hatchet.
It *was* delayed. From September to November

When I first saw the screenshot I thought it was going to say something along the lines of: Not all controllers are created equally, beauty has no size, Love your curves, etc.


So, are people actually still saying video games make people violent? I've not seen a story like that in years. 
I thought we had moved beyond this by now.

It's even worse in VR. You have 0 situational awareness.
GTA V sold something like 70 million copies. I don't know why some gamers are still hung up on their hobby being accepted by the mainstream. It already has been.
I don't think it's a popular opinion anymore fam (if it ever was)
"Yeah they do."

the n64 controller though, shit was sharp, you could kill a bitch

And now we have Vive controllers. I have seen no greater threat to light bulbs then blindfolding a man, not being able to mark how high your ceiling is on the chaperone bounds, and encouraging the throwing of objects.

Troll post. Nothing to see here, folks
how to play game this ? help says too..
Only real issue I have is the stupid AI. Reminds me of the AI on GoldenEye 007 (N64 title). 
I've always hoped they smooth out the movement in the ES games - for the NPCs, I mean.

It is always so jerky and odd.
I agree. Skyrim is extremely dumb down ES game catered to the casual console players. 

It's still a fun game but it ain't as fun as Morrowind. 
I wish they would put the worst players in the trailers instead of the best so I could see how my gaming experience would be. 
Nice Trailer, but I want some new weapons too. :/

it's a matter of what the company of the game allows in their Terms of use or User agreements.

For Example Trading Ingame Items for Ingame Gold should be ok. But Trading Real Money for Ingame items or Gold is in most Online games not allowed (at least not trough a 3rd party website) and could get you banned.

They say they are doing it for a long time now (1999) but with all these sites I would be careful and ask myself if it is worth the risk on losing your account.

As a Guild Wars 2 player (which is listed as one of their covered games) I can tell you that you probably will get banned if you contribute in Gold Selling activities.

Personally, I wouldn't risk it.
I've sold a few things on there. Works good, but they get a slice of the pie.
It comes with the game kinda like how the Witcher 3 did.
Whatd you do save one of their children? thats a lot of signatures
I cant get enough of the battle system/warp slaying... so much fun. I fckn love this game
12 hours in.. loving it. I only wish I could get the Titan to fuck up one of the world bosses for me.
Wow that is awesome. What did you do
Wow what a racist company, they only have asian/japanese people. #diversitylivesmatter
Thanks for releasing like 7 years late, I guess.
I remember really enjoying the mod on my PS3 awhile back, and I imagine if I redo the heat sink I might if I'm lucky be able to dig through the systems files till I can locate the map, but I'm doubtful. I recently bought the Black edition on Steam and was hoping to play this map, but I'm having difficulties in locating it.
Its closer to a Roguelike than Survival Horror
I would say that Infinite Mode would be considered survival horror, since nothing respawns and the player is constantly losing health.
You should share this over on /r/crashbandicoot.
I ducking love this game. I still play it sometimes on my ps3
Yes! I played the shit out of this game back in the day. Before some prick stole it and a number of my games. 
Pretty sure it has something to do with your cpu clockspeed and not with the game.
Have you tried uninstalling the game? Then re downloading it?
I had the same issue earlier. I force restarted it and it works fine now. Not sure if it's a permanent fix though.
I see your problem.. you're playing a shooter on Xbox.
"We want this game about a fast running hedgehog to be longer.

Let's dedicate an entire section to a big, fat, fishing cat"
It's insanely easy to implement, requires very little testing, and can add hours to gameplay. You see a lot of slot machine style mini games for the same reasons.
Much like real life. It wastes your time.

Rerererepost!!!!!
My friend claims he learned how to drive from GTA. I'm never letting him drive
If only your frame rate could be right. 
They are all good. Primal is very immense if you really get into it. Fallout is great also. Can't really make a bad choice here
In my opinion, Fallout 4 really blows Primal out of the water. However, both are good game and both are great value at 20 dollars. Primal is more unique, but Fallout if more polished. I personally think that Primal loses its novelty pretty quickly.  No opinion to give on Far Cry 4, unfortunately. I got past the intro and never really got around to playing it again. 
I dont personally care for Fallout but its definitely a good deal at $20. Loved both of those Far Cry games. Would recommend Primal if you want a bit more story and bow/melee fighting, as well as beast taming so its more of a Skyrim feel. Far Cry 4 was great but its kinda the same old thing, shooting up camps and what not. I suppose you have the stealth option in there too but i definitely preferred Primal.
I've played several city-building games, the game mechanics difference between city-building and war-games is very different so it would be hard to give the player a full gaming experience of both, the game that comes closest to what you want is games like Anno, Caesar and Pharaoh (my all-time favorite).
Just when you thought you seen it all in Borderlands.
That's procedural generation for you.

Wait until you see a gun that consumes 2 ammo per shot, but has a 5 round magazine. You can still fire 3 times (somehow).
Considering its in its 17th entry, it's safe to say it has a bigger following than you would think.

Simulators are very popular in Europe. This particular game is fun when you just wanna sit back and have a beer.
Nice bowl
yup. there a bunch of people out there that actually enjoy those simulator games
That is my go to relax game. When i want to watch streams or videos but still like to fiddle with my keyboard. I got stream on my secondary display and the game on primary. I like it.
Dont hate on farming simulator, its funner than it seems.
It's a very popular franchise with many people. This iteration has sold the most copies from what I've read. There are streamers who make a living off playing this game 
The bigger issue is your pipe in the picture, come on man.
Yup.
Simulators are pretty popular now. I remember when XboxAhoy made a video about Euro Truck, and I was hooked. You literally just drive a truck around, but there's a lot of satisfaction for some reason.
It's one of those "I don't play it but my girlfriend does" games. The previous iteration got surprisingly good reviews. 
I would never buy it but I bet that game is fun as fuck haha 
$40? Shit, it WAS $50! Better farm pussy for that price. 
I did, and I regret it. I got half way through the tutorial before realizing I made a big mistake.
I like how Dishonored games make it so tempting to kill every mofo in sight by giving you tons of awesome deadly powers and making it feel so cool -- but you get a bad ending if you do it.
THIS.IS.SPARTA
Reminds me of when Vinesauce did a livestream where Tomodachi Life banned the phrase 'Of a giant whale' because of the 'f a g' part...
If anyone is wondering why, it's because you can't use any of the playable class name in your own name and "Cra" are the archers. (Arc spelled backwards, which means bow in french)
Emo?
Is this "Dofus"?
Dofus, so many memories!
Wow, people still play Dofus? Haven't played that in _ages_

Now wakfu, that's where it's at.
"Democracy" is non-negotiable.
what game is this?
Too racy for them, obviously. 
Shit dofus still around?
DOFUS!!!
It's the [Scunthorpe problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem)
emo? racy? ocra?
Fuck yeah Dofus!
what game is this?
Do people still play Dofus? I got really high and now no ones online 
Holy shit people still play Dofus?
Just call them "Senor Koquonfaes"
wait.... whats the word?
Demo?
Dem?
Emo?
Racy?

SO CONFUSED
There was a flash game I really enjoyed called Brotherhood of Battle. 

One of the playable classes was called the Assassin. Problem is, if you ever said Assassin in chat, it would appear as ******in. 
That's a fucking old dofus screenshot
What game is this? The art style kinda looks like Wakfu...
Crac?
Comrade Gamer!
People still play Dofus?
Upvote for old dofus
North Korean Addition?
Is that... Dofus?
Dofus is going f2p!!!
i hate controlling games like that. I hope that game dies in a horrible car accident.
Red Chinese communist game. Must be eradicated./LibertyPrime
Probably ”racy”
Must be Chinese made game.

I recently realised my username has a bit of a bad word in it haha and I was given it by Microsoft on an old account many years ago
I'll actually look into this op. As i grow older i find myself playing unarmed a llooottt. I just started an unarmed character in fantasy age and our dm was crazy excited. 
Just picked up the Special Edition too
I skipped school to play it.
played the shit out of it.. xD. I like shooting them buffalos
90's? No. 80's, yes.
I don't know I died of dysentery before I got it.
I thought it was a great game back in the 80s. 
I'm a little surprised Rockstar released an update for this game.
> I LOVE when my picture turns sideways when uploading to reddit...

What picture ?
Huh?
Struggle is real.
Must be the last copy
Lol ran out of spider wraps 
Is that an infected copy? Copy 0?
Likely the #1 shoplifted game of the holiday season if we are being real here.
This is just ridiculous. Why even display it at this point? Why not just keep all the games in a bomb-proff safe in the back and make them ticket-order them? Fucking christ. 
so..2mobile games and another moba because we don't have enough of those. those two mobile game do look interesting but I'm not sure if it will be one of those games I need 10minutes to do one thing, because that would be horrible for mobile games. 
That reminds me, I haven't had breakfast
I love how there's just one last guy standing in the end, only to drop dead.
What game?  Doom? 
Just reminds me of good old [Barrels o' fun](http://i.imgur.com/BLejo9T.mp4).
Really pleasantly surprised by the new DOOM, didn't expect to be. I love how they've managed to capture the flowing maelstrom of combat from the original, whilst still retaining and improving on the aesthetic of Doom 3.
That's a big fucking gun.
God I fucking love that game. I hope they make a DooM 2017 II with higher mob limits and more explodie bits! 
Reminds me of good ol' Rise of the Triad, ludicrous gibs!
I am severely disappointed with the lack of Mark Harmon in this post...
Anyone else go through this room picking off enemies with the standard hand gun to conserve ammo?
Ludicrous Gibs
If you are in the UK just a heads up that DOOM with season pass bundle is currently £20 on Amazon :)
It'd be a shame to put the actual game name in the title...What do the mods do here?
I love how the barrel to the right is so giddy and excited at the end, twirling about like

"Heeheehee so much destruction!"
Damn, after seeing this and recently getting an Ultrawide monitor, I really want to go home and play DOOM now..
Instagib? Brb... gonna log into the UT demo servers. 
Fun Fact: Because the game doesn't put the BFG in weapon rotation, I never knew I had it after the cinematic. Thought I needed to find ammo before I could use it.

Fun Fact 2: The game never tells you that the green orbs are BFG ammo. I ended up doing almost entire playthrough on 2nd to hardest difficulty without using the BFG because of these poor introductions.
I did the same exact thing in that room. So fun. Just a fun game in general.
That barrel makes this whole thing hilarious. 
And then they all disappear. ='(
doom=bestgame
https://imgflip.com/i/1ez96g
This room is also conveniently located right after you first get the BFG, too. A nice touch.
That wasn't very nice.
...can someone Photoshop the Bee Gees into this?
I did this section wrong by using weapons not the BFG. Am dumb.
Ah yes. Possibly my favorite part of the campaign. Seriously, was there any other way through? I THINK NOT!
I fucking love that moment... I had to stop to giggle for a while after that. They clearly know exactly what makes their game good.
Begin the chanting. BFG BFG BFG
I did this just this morning! 
That barrel dancing next to you in the end
God damn,i need to play this game
I gotta say that barrel at the end was pretty stoked with that level of Gibbs 
That red barrel on the right... How is it still intact?


Weird.
What game is this?
The barrel could feel the wub.
...but now they're chunks of meat.
This is oddly satisfying to watch
Rip o(riginal po)st
Please please add co-op.... :(
Am I the only one who came here looking for [Gibbs?](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/3/005/08c/05b/20dff1f.jpg)
That gun seriously reminds me of Turok.
God I hope I like this game.
UGGH THE MAIN MENU + THE MUSIC, SO BEAUTIFUL
God i hope it better than the last 2....  :(
Is it sad that there are a bunch of people who passed away waiting for it? Like 8 years is a bloody long time.
IN AZKABAN! 
It has been in development for 10 years though
Final Fantasy XV just dropped and The Last Guardian coming out next week... So much shit has happened since these games were originally announced. I remember watching the reveal trailers back in 2008, being so excited. And now here they finally are, coming out a week apart from each other almost a decade later. It's weird to feel nostalgia over games that are just now releasing. Hope they live up to all the years spent waiting.
I'VE DONE MY WAITING!
I never really got into FF I tried to play a few on recommendation and was bored to tears,  and also I felt nothing for any characters.   I know it's subjective,  enjoy hopefully. 
Everyone is playing....

And I had to make the reservation on the only store in Spain that did not make an early delivery...
congratulation after that you Got the Original Copy of that game.
Did you try using a blade?

8 years sounds sort of a long time...
I remember arguing with some guy in 2010 or so that was fully convinced that Versus XIII would come out that year and was furious with me for doubting.
I could have sworn they first showed it off in 2006.
I need this on PC. Just traded the last console of the house. FFXIV is scratching the itch at the moment
I'm loving this game so far!! About 3.5 hours in!
8 years? That's cute. I've been waiting 9 years... Or 12 years... Depends on which date you start counting at. I might get my wish in another 20 or so years.
And who has the last laugh now...  Dr. Zoidberg maybe?
It's been 10 though. 
10 years
Ordered on Amazon, payed for overnight shipping and it's not here! Much salt.
I am pretty certain this is Good Charlotte.

(You may need to rotate the picture)  
Benji is definitely the lower left.  
Billy Martin lower right.  
Joel upper right.  
From I found on Google Paul always did some weird thing, but I'm pretty sure his is the upper left.  
Image for reference for Paul's signature:
http://www.drdotsblog.com/blog-city-files/f/good_charlottesmaller.jpg

Based on google searches for these signatures, though, I'd say it's a pretty safe bet to be Good Charlotte. Fits the time period, too.
Bottom left is for sure Jon Bon Jovi 
In 2002 - 2004 it was popular with radio stations to do this, offer concert tickets and a signed Xbox. 
They ruined the value of the Xbox. 
Im not trying to be mean, but you might want to get someone that can proofread your articles before posting.
That's just a blu-ray of the e3 footage over the years. 
They do exist
*santa passes out*
With how long this took to come out, it is going to be impossible for it to live up to people's expectations. I hope it's good. I was a little underwhelmed by the in game footage they've shown. 
I'm still not convinced they're going to go find and smash all existing copies to work another 2 years on it. 
I just reread the Cracked article of games you'll never play. This is prominently featured. 
What happened to this game?
I guarantee it will be a disappointment
Edit: got a couple downvotes so figured I'll defend my position. I've heard a lot of negative things about the game from people who have played. Not only that but the biggest complaint is it looks and feels like a PS3 game and that's because it is. It's not made for PS4 originally and was just resurrected for the PS4. On top of that there is a lot of hype and that is usually where disappointment comes from.
No ps4 seal on the box
Did you buy it

Last Guardian director Promises Unmissable Ending
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/29/the-last-guardian-director-promises-unmissable-ending-in-letter-to-fans
Wait, so, how long have people been waiting for this?
I'd rather they had delayed this instead of Gravity Rush 2.
That plastic looks cheap as fuck for some reason.

Anyway I was never hyped for this game so I'll probably end up enjoying it, unless it just sucks ass. Lucky me.
I came across a row of them at a unnamed store yesterday. Yes it totally stopped me in my track. I think I buy the PS5 remaster in five years or so. Serve them well from making me wait and killing all hype I had for it. 
That's what you get for running over the guy who drank the nitroglycerin 
Seems okay to me, that guy was pretty strong.
When did people start calling parkour, "hipster"?
Yes hipsters have acrobatic abilities, super human grip strength and mild gravity defying powers.  
The fuck does this have to do with being a hipster?
What game is this?
You mean 'flipster'?
I think by hipster OP means the characters clothes.
Watch dogs 2. Saved you guys a comment
What does this even mean...?
/r/titlegore
I like how at the end of many sweet clips you can see that the player hit the record button hh. 
OP deliberatly said hipster for the attention.
Must be all them Capachinos at starbucks giving an extra spring to his step.
yo how fun is this game I wanna pick it up.
That guy needs to learn about [ladder safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mApAnem68U)
Are there non-hipstery styles in this game? I probably wont buy it if that is all you can wear. At least the first game had some pretty cool outfits.
*Hmm I bet I could fit a backflip in there..*
Try for [Big Boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgaYe4ZYYyY) rank next time.
Isn't this originally from Brownman's (Ray's) stream? 
I never fucking laugh out loud on reddit, but this did it for me. Holy fuck.

The way the guy climbs up and just quickly somersaults, like no big deal, and gets fucking gravitated towards the ladder. Fuckkk. 

Literal tears. 
Does the movement look/feel like The Division? 
Very curious.
Its called having style
That sums up the whole game.
Ah, Ubisoft and it's weird-ass glitches...
DUMB ASS OP. PUT THE TITLE IN THE POST.
Is there any way to not wear skinny jeans in this game?

Edit: lmao what? It's a genuine question.
Looks like I will be staying away from Watch Dogs 2 if they can't even get gravity coded right.
Man, Watchdogs 2 looks like crap.
Yup, it's still retarded

What system is this on?

Yeah that sure was [hilarious](http://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2011/05/81526098/react.jpg)
Looks great but I hope they add more challenge to it. Maybe a hard mode as an option? I know it goes against the core philosophy of the game but from the Alpha I could tell this game was never going to be challenging... I'm willing to bet the adult audience is bigger than they think and they should capitalize on the chance to add a survival / hard mode
It's really similar to [Cube World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuTT1TFgfoE)
What's it coming out for?
What a shitty article. It might as well be titled "Play the game as it's meant to be played."
HYPE
I have twin 8 year old girls.  One is a beast at video games.  I tear up when she beats me at Mario Kart.  It's not often, cause I'll be damned if I'm gonna go easy on her.  Sometimes, though, she is unstoppable. It's really fun to have her have a love for video games.   
I wonder how many years from now people will still be playing World 1-1

This game is timeless I suppose
I love how gaming at this age demands the gamer stand up.  So intense!!  Cute stuff :)
That's a badass tv
How is the Retron? I still have all my old systems but I keep looking at a retron 3 so I can hook it up in the main living room and play some classics. Is the emulation good enough that it's not painfully obvious you're not playing on the actual system?
I plan on doing the same thing, exept with yu-gi-oh.

There gonna have a bitch of a time, beating my exodia though.
Except this time she gets a tv thats 4x the size of the one you had.
Has to be the second kid.

Our first son, no tv until two, never said "no" to him.  Said "please do this instead"

Second kid... TV at six months, video games at two.  Entirely gave up on the kind parenting method and resorted to yelling to get things done.

Nothing eroded good intentions like multiple kids.
Gamer in training. You're gonna have to beat the boys away from that one with a stick. 
My twins are 2 and I'm begging for this day to happen. Sigh. Maybe next year.
Oh yes.  The next generation starts.  I have a picture of my nephew when he was like 2 or 3 holding my old Gameboy playing a game.  You can just see the wheels clicking, just like in the OP!
Try hard pants on. Out of the chair, hard focusing... 
My cousin and I who are avid gamers taught my younger brother to play video games. Now he has the best traits of both of us and beats me at anything not sports game related...he doesn't like sports.
Good on you having the Retron 5. That thing's a beaut. 
You need not pass the torch, you need only light hers anew. 
As a video game nerd who will unfortunately never have kids, this warms my heart.

Especially seeing someone so young enjoy something that was a part of my childhood too.
Amazing... someone who puts it in the proper aspect ratio!
> The ~~torch~~ wrench has been passed

FTFY
Hey, honey? Can you just stand still, hold this and look up to the screen? *click* Good girl! 
:)
Elsanna shipping?
So you're the guy/girl who got the one NES Classic Mini they released 
That picture is so cute and make me smile to see such an anachronistic setting! But I have something I have thought about for a while that I would like to have peoples opinion about, and I am not trying to criticize or be negative at all! It's more like something I have been pondering over for a while and that I'm trying to figure out for when I'll have my own child in the not so distant future. I grew up playing Nintendo and Super Nintendo and would love to have them play these games too and watch old school TMNT and such. I love when people make their kid play retro games or watch old cartoon from when they were kids. But at what point are we pushing our own nostalgia and memories down their throats? I mean, by doing this aren't we being a bit selfish and making them miss out on their own generation's memories for the sake of reliving our own? What if my dad did not get me a NES when I was a kid and made me play Colleco Vision and watch The Lone Ranger? I figure that this kid is not cut off completly considering the Frozen baby chair though so I guess it all come down to balancing stuff but what do you guys think about this subject? Am I the only one worrying about these implications?
such cutscenes much amazing
Things like this make me want this game so much. That's amazing you can even do that!
Needs achievement called "Death from Above"
I'm level 23.. are you telling me your titan drops where you're aiming? (Assuming a viable location) because I had no idea, I always just pressed V no matter where I was or where I was looking, would always get pissed off when my titan would drop half way across the map lol.
Legion players in a nutshell
Super glad I picked this up during Black Friday. I'm excited to try it
Ok , you win reddit I bought titanfall 2
that may have been an auto titan but kudos to you for actually getting the kill with your titan 
~~Justice~~ Titan rains from above!
Is this actually impressive? I was disappointed in myself if I didn't crush a player controlled Titan each time I called Titanfall in the first game. I haven't played much TF2 yet but I doubt it's much harder to accomplish. 
The game looks really fun but it's a shame they chose to release in in such a crowded month, I'm worried that it's been smothered by BF1. I don't want to buy it unless the population picks up during the holidays.
This is a great clip to introduce people to the awesomeness that is Titanfall 2. Not only is it cool but this happens like every game.
My experience with this game has been that if I were to stand that still for that long, I would have died a long time ago.
That thing is always so broken though. Mine always ends up across the entire map into the enemy spawn. Even with a clear landing spot.
There is an upgrade for your Titan where you can call it in much quicker at the expense of your shield that protects it while it waits for you to enter, I use this and use the drop function to one-hit-kill bounty Titans or other online players. 

It's hilarious.
Gotta give 'em points for the shield parry though.

I take Warp Core specifically so I can do this. On maps with chokeholds, it's not uncommon to get doublekills like this. Really want that triple.
I'd be more impressed if it wasn't set up.
That auto-titan tracking speed though. Auto-titan must be using a controller too lol
Titanfall sucks

Not cinematic enough. It needs to be at 24 fps.
seems like more than 24 fps?

 Those actions were all cpu and no gpu so initially it was smooth but lagged out after the sequence of actions.

Why repost literally a few days after the original?

Nice copy paste from turn 10!

It was one of many BS lies from HG. No, it is not truly multiplayer. But hey, you can like build a house now. 
You can't actually run into anybody, there is a video of two people who went to the same system and went to the same space station and nothing. When the game first launched the third solar system I ended up in had already been discovered and all the planets had already been named. I'm not sure if they plan on incorporating any sort of multiplayer aspects, hopefully they do! 
You cant. I've tried. We were on the same planet staring at the same building. 
I have a question. Did the planet look exactly the same? And if it did, was the system the same? Same planets in the system, same systems next to that system? I'm just wondering because I want to know if everyone's game is the same. Or is it like a random map type thing? What I'm thinking is that, maybe they weren't on the same planet. Like the planet can be set in stone, creatures, plants, terrain can all be the same, but is it in the same location as in everyone else's game?
Is this a joke thread?
Runs on No Man's PC
Sorry bro, not random.
It was a cool experience but it was definitely not random. I saw it on my way back to the gas station after completing the first hunt quest from Cindy. Looks like the same spot. 
Only stick figure game I remember is Stick RPG. You could gamble, sell drugs, work at McDonald's lol. 
Was it the game that went along with the Madness flash video series?
I enjoy the crew for it's open world and map.
Depends what you want. The Crew is kinda like the burnout series. 


Project Cars is more of a sim, but it's physics are sometimes weird, but its probably the best looking racing game out there right now, but the AI is pretty bad. You could also try Assetto Corsa, you can mod it, and the physics is better than PCars, but it's not as good looking also.


If you are looking for online multiplayer iRacing is probably the best. But it's expensive since you have to subscribe.

 Forza Horizon 3 is probably the best one graphically, has great controls and is really well structured to always have you doing something interesting even when you're driving to a destination. i havent played a racing game this good in a long time

Nice! I've passed through times like that, too. Right when I started to feel the groove again, then I start to not having as much time to play! Oh, life! And now I just play whenever I can and yeah, like every hard-worker that enjoys gaming I supose.
Dude I'm in a gaming drought right now and it SUCKS, I have so many amazing games that I can play through right now but I load them up and instantly get bored, hopefully something will draw me in again soon
I can definitely relate, GTA IV was my game. I played the story over 5 times and the number thing i loved was when you kill Vlad, knowing that the fucker was banging your cousins fiance always pissed me off. It was always funny too because I would always do something in the story that made me forget that i did before (hopefully i worded it right lol). This is why i keep all the games i buy, I always know that i will walk into Gamestop looking at the games they have knowing that i can easily jump back into that game in a heartbeat.
I just recently got into the groove again - Stardew Valley. Great little farming/townie sim. I've put about 100 hours into it in the past month. It's a breath of fresh air.

I also just started Cook, Serve, Delicious! again, but with a controller this time. It's a great little arcade style game. I'm really enjoying it.

Both of these are outside my realm of normal games. I think that's what drove me to get hooked again - a change of pace. Glad to hear you are revisiting something great and are excited!
I just went through the same thing, I've been buying games nonstop during sales and I just didn't care.  I'd play a half hour to an hour of them and then look for something else.

Then I downloaded Mad Max.  A couple hours later I realized I had to make dinner.  Now I'm counting down the time until I can play again.  

Drought over
Star Citizen is not done. If you are looking for a feature complete game, don't get Star Citizen. If you are patient, and want to back a game in development, then maybe you can think about backing Star Citizen.

yeah you should.

Game?
This game pisses me off because I SUCK.  SO.  BADLY.
A-Wall is incredible. I pair it with the devotion and pulse rifle (with charge hack), absolutely devastating.
God I love this game. I feel like a superhero every time I play it. Stim with the CAR and Tone all day.
Huh. I was playing with one of the dudes you kill in this gif just this morning!
Every time I see a Titanfall gif I have no idea what's going on
Smooth moves!!
Wish I could get as smooth of a picture as this.

Just bought Titanfall 2 and can play with everything maxed but the game is suffering from SERIOUS stuttering causing it to be unplayable.
I hate shields like this in mp shooters, the dumb bubble in halo 3

Why not both?
Star Wars: The Old Republic functions as a sequel. It wasn't the sequel we wanted, but it was the sequel we got.

With that in mind if any game needs a "remastering" it's KOTOR2. Why? Because maybe they could go back and fix the damn thing. It's riddled with bugs, missing huge swaths of content and doesn't have a proper ending. 
I'd be happy with either to be honest.
You mean it needs to be finished.
And since EA owns SW licence, it's guaranteed shitty sequel.
Agreed too many I WANT A REMASTER. The only thing I think needs a remaster as of right now is diablo 2 as a way to tide the masses as they make diablo 4 into an actual game unlike diablo 3.
This game was too gloomy.  

I remember playing this game and being disappointed that it wasn't like KOTOR 1.  

Kreia was awesome, though.

Not as fun or as awesome as the first but not bad. 
Anytime I see this being posted I get emotional because of the fun memories I had playing KOTOR on the original Xbox when it launched and despise the fact that KOTOR 2 was when I played through the game. But this brings me to ask, couldn't we get a petition going to get EA to remaster the game bioware wanted to make? I know with the recent things with EA isn't what any of us want for the game to be handled by them but what if they try at least? I'll sleep better knowing EA put in some sort of effort to remaster the game. Don't get me wrong I've played KOTOR 2 with the community mods but it just doesn't seem to scratch that itch I have for the way I wanted to game to be.

TL;DR let's get a petition going for the game to be remastered 
No thank you. Present day Bioware is only a shadow of their former glory. If Obsidian did it on the other hand... but that will never happen :(
That's not KOTOR 1 though.
I'll take what I can get.
Remastered KOTOR 1 & 2 with battlefront's graphics would be goddamn amazing 
They'd have to finish it first.
No... I need to tell carth to stfu in HD. 
Do you think this is the game respawn are working on??
I've made a post like this before, but if you want the sequel, definitely try giving SWTOR a shot, it's significantly different than what it was at launch.  you only have to do the story based missions to level up, you don't have to do anymore grinding. 
The second one needs to actually be finished first.
Fuck I wants it 
Can we fucking chill with all the remaster shit?  I would rather it be a sequel or a re-imaging vs just a straight up remaster.  Give me a new experience, if I want to replay the game, I will just replay the game, it doesn't need to look "new" for me to enjoy it.
It's why I was dreading the MMO.  With the MMO I feel like they think that it counts as it having a sequel, one that is continuously updating for that matter, so they won't bother.
Next week someone is gonna post "This game doesn't need a sequel. It needs a remaster!"
Every time there's a SWTOR apologist. It did raise the bar on MMORPG story telling, but that's about it. It's a frustrating MMO. Like collect 6 hound teeth, well everyone is killing them and 30 of them don't seem to have teeth. Also annoying are quests where you need to kill groups of enemies to use an item behind them, well some jerk loots it while you're fighting. It pits players against each other in PvE, and that is terrible design. WoW has been getting better in the last 2 expansions with having more world quests where all players work together, like there's an elite enemy in the open, so everyone gets XP and loot for killing it, even if nobody is in a party.
You folks should try Jade Empire. It's the closest you'll ever get.
Just got this for $2.50
It has one, they just made it into a MMORPG instead.

Are you funny?  Do you have a good voice?  Those two things will go far if you're trying to break into the hyper-saturated Let's Play channel space.  I also recommend you play a good mix of new releases and older throwbacks, and anything obscure you can find that doesn't already have a lot of coverage on YouTube.
I always liked people who can allow themselves to be challenged, but where it isn't boring. Skyrim, for example. Watching them Kite and Block for 10 minutes a fight is boring to watch. Know when to challenge yourself, and when it is boring to watch.

I personally like grand strategy games, and like watching how they're played. They are like minecraft, no two plays will be the same.

Also, I hate when people say "Remember to leave a like/add if you liked this video" seriously, we'll add and comment if we feel like it. Don't beg us.

Most people pander to a younger audience, I would like more channels that are made for older, more mature players, with jokes and humor made for older gaming veterans. Less slyfoxxhounds, more LethalFelines please.
Something charismatic. So many channels are just some monotone person playing a game quietly. Hype up your audience. Don't be a pewdiepie clone who just overreacts to everything. Be yourself but amp it up a little and have fun with it. Your audience will be far more receptive if you yourself are having fun making content.

I already started my ps4 digtal collection 
I've done that on Xbox One. If I *really* want a game immediately at a decent price I might have to buy a used physical version, but generally I wait for sales on Xbox Live. The recent Black Friday weekend sale added another eight games to my library. Digital is just so much easier, and I never trade games in anyway. 
I always buy digital. You can get games asap from the comfort of your home, no disc swapping, and you'll never lose or break your games.
I have an 8TB hard drive in my console and about 100 games, all digital. Best decision ever.

I wouldn't know. Don't pay that much attention to game bathrooms. If i ever find myself in a bathroom in a game, there are exactly 2 things i check for. 

If i can use the toilet

If i can shoot out the mirrors

I don't consider it 'amazing'. NMS was a $60 investment, it's only natural people would want to see if maybe they can get enjoyment out of it now.
Give it a week or 2 and then post this again.
What did the update do? 
If they own the game and can't get a refund anymore then they have nothing to lose by checking what's new, but looking how the game is fundamentaly shit, it will never see lasting high numbers.
nms set a record of shortest half life of active players on steam. starting with 200k players, 12 hours later it went down to 100k players, and that half life decayed pretty much ever since. not counting <200 suckers making constant backbround noise. due to being a pathethic boring repetitive constrained game and a pathethic console port with horrible performance and retarded UI.

the recent short 6k local maximum just shows that roughly 10k of likely 250k people did not refund nms, or just could not care less to do so.

such a short half life guarantees many full refunds.
An update and two paid social media campaigns. They have been trending for a week. I call b.s
I couldn't stand to load up NMS even after the update. The first 6 hours when I bought the game was all I needed and I have zero want to ever install it again. 
Too soon to draw any conclusion.
"Amazing"? Did it bring anything they promised originally? Did it fix the annoying systems management? Did it make materials interesting? Did it add any context or story? Space Battles? Factions? 

Oh, they added a shitty version of Minecraft to the game? PASSSSSS!
Now that the Foundation patch has been released, this is a chance for Hello Games prove themselves. Release enough patches so NMS becomes a complete game and people will actually buy it.
Too bad I refunded it and can't bring myself to buy it again just to try out an update that should have been included when it was released. 
LMAO. Great meme dude XD
Wut?
You can't.
Hahaha best joke I've heard all week
You don't.
You just jumped into the last game of a series that's been running for decades.

Good fucking luck.
that intro was batshit for everyone, but at the same time we have more context to work with (we know who those 3 characters are).  

as for the rest of the story, just accept that you'll be lost. 
As someone who has played 2 and 3, what you just described is pretty nutty
Metal Gear is known for having very crazy convoluted story lines. Its actually quite interesting twisting path if you can follow it. 

Try watching this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22qpIrBJJRY 
"Random dude on a horse" 

Yeah, you should play the others first.  At least 3, as this follows it, chronologically.  Though you should probably play 1 and 2 to understand what you're in for.  Just know they're great games and shouldn't take more than a few nights to go through, so not a waste of time.  There was a great HD remaster set that came out for last gen.  Can probably be had for cheap.

You can skip 4, as it takes place well after this game and is really long. 
Welcome to Metal Gear motherfucker
...and you can correspondingly buy Battlefield 1 and Titanfall on Uplay as well as Square Enix games (Tomb Raider, Deus Ex)

This is not new. Origin and Uplay have both sold games from other publishers for some time now. They are trying to become general download stores and not just publisher specific stores.
where do you see EA is selling WD 2?
while origin is mainly the company storefront for EA they have always sold a number of non-EA titles. CD Project and Ubi aren't stupid and know that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket but instead have your stuff be sold in all available stores if possible. And as for Ubi you will probably still need Uplay to actually start it as it's the case when bought through steam.
You sure it is?
Story: I bought a DELL S2716DG 27" Gaming Monitor back in May when there was a shellshocker for it.  Nabbed it for $479, maybe overpaid, but I loved the monitor.  G-sync is awesome for gaming and I don't think I can ever go back.

My adopted Golden Retriever had surgery a couple days ago to remove a tumor from her hip and was resting under my legs at my desk.  Without warning, she made the loudest yelp sound I've ever heard and jumped.  I think I reflexively tried to dodge her, which cause my knee to catch the table and bring it with me.  The monitor fell off the back and well... the rest is history.  

Gallery for more money burning goodness... http://imgur.com/a/Bwb7f

At least I still have the top left of the monitor to use for gaming, granted the text looks a little weird in parts.

Edit: Chatted with Dell, told it was covered under the warranty.  Called up dell, after being transferred to 4 different people, told it wasn't covered under the warranty.

- Dude is stuck in zombie infested area for 3 days
- During the space of this time they can try to save some survivors
- Has the option to uncover a big "conspiracy", but if they fail a mission they can keep going without progressing the story, or restart while keeping their level.
- Zombies aren't the real threat. It's the people who turned into psychopaths due to the zombie apocalypse

I haven't played 3, but this was pretty much the skeleton of 1 & 2.

Return it, get an Asus Rog laptop. Or make sure it's not using the built in graphics card instead of the radeon
It's probably using the integrated graphics to run games. Set the laptop to only ever use the actual graphics card and see if it works.
This game sucked because it had that one shot beheading move.  After a bunch of battles the ai started doing it to you.

Nice! Loved chopping off my friend's heads in this game, they used to get so angry.
And nobody give a shit because he became irrelevant before summer started
When did smash 4 have talking segments?
That Jak 3 one happens real early too. 
Fun article, but no mention of the Metal Gear franchise?  We got the PS1-era FFVII in there, but glossed over your doctor telling you to put the controller on your arm before making it vibrate (with Snake grunting something like "Oooh, that feels good") and a boss checking your memory card for Castlevania saves?  Disappoint.
Personally I would say Silent Hill is scarier. The Silent Hill series has had more of a focus on psychological horror which I find to be more frightening. Resident Evil just had zombies and genetically engineered creatures, which are indeed scary but I never got the same feeling of fear from those games. Now don't get me wrong, I like the Resident Evil series as well but in terms of pure fear and dread I would go with Silent Hill. It makes me sad that we will never see the Silent Hills game that Hideo Kojima was working on. That would have been so amazing.
Silent Hill with honorable mention, Dead Space.
To me it's resident evil. It had a lot of jump scare scenes
I think I'm tied between the two,no favourite,movie or gaming,both have my kind of scary

Perhaps r/tipofmytongue or r/tipofmyjoystick can help?
Looks pretty, but what new features will this title bring to the table? In many ways it looks similar to the 3rd installment, how will they change it up and make this a unique experience?
This isn't current but hotline Miami had an awesome one
Hyper Light Drifter

Life Is Srange has the best one I've heard.

Well having a 10+ year development hell cycle will certainly do that
Its the next game from one of the most well known franchises in video games.
The hype died down because they took 10 years too make it... when the date got close then everyone  was like oh fuck here comes dat final fantasy!! 
It's the first ff for this generation of consoles. 
Wouldn't say gaming saved my life, but it's certainly been a constant outlet for me my whole life, especially in my late teens when my anxiety reared it's ugly head and kicked my ass. I could always turn my PS3 on & and let the game take over my mind rather than loud intrusive thoughts for a little while. I fondly look back on COD BO2, the repetitive multiplayer and screaming 13 year olds made me laugh and put me in a better mood. 

I still play video games semi-regularly, but unfortunately I've hit hard financial times so it's hard for me to keep up with all these new releases. But Christmas time is around the corner, so maybe I'll get a gift card or two lol. 

Cool topic, OP. 
Are there any more trailers for this? Maybe with a little more?

You do realize that starting your post with "Am I the only one..." will always get downvoted. Man, there are so many people browsing this reddit you will never be the only one. 
Strike a middle ground;

Major buildings like armories should be explorable like you said, for building things/upgrading units.

Houses and resource collecting stations should remain static.

This gives a bit more immersion without having to kill yourself over making EVERYTHING explorable.
I was thinking about something similar to this yesterday actually. I thought it would be cool to have an rts where you run around in 1st/3rd person but a lot of the other stuff like building structures is done with voice commands.
Ha. Just had to see for myself. Also says made in China soooo
Hello from Seattle, aka China. 
I remember my Zune said *Hello From Seattle* on the back. 
Hello from the other side
Dammit, I spotted this the other and was going to post it. Take this up vote and get out of my head. 
Microsoft confirmed Owl City fans
"Also a hello from China where I had to work 14 hours building X-Box controllers and got only some Yuans to feed my family. I don't mind, that's the way capitalism works, you need two thirds of people to work for no money for the 1 third of people with money. I know I will never have a X-Box, but perhaps my kids will have one. Please keep that always in mind when you play your expensive videogames."

tl;dr: This "greeting" is one of the most dishonest things I ever saw on a device. It's the contrast statement to "made in china".

I remember entering VAC free lobbies just to get items with unlimited durability, only thing that late game seemed more of an annoyance than a gameplay aspect 
A lot of games have similar issues.

People complain about the game not changing, but pour money into buying microtransactions. Call of Duty is another good example.

Boycotts will never work because they don't gain any ground. Not only that, but complaining about microtransactions in this fashion does nothing. All they do is raise their profit, and they don't lose anything from not selling micros. Doesn't cost them any more money to put them in.

Used to play this back in elementary school in the library. Interested in seeing if any of you guys played it too, or if it was just a thing at my school.

I remember it being pretty fun, but it got hard pretty fast. Pretty sure you would click and drag a player to move him, and then release the left click to throw a snowball. The longer you held it, the further it threw, and it was an elimination game kind of like dodgeball.
HOLY SHIT!!!! YOU JUST BROUGHT ME BACK TO 3RD GRADE HARD! GG WP
Oh man, nostalgia trip. I used to play this and another game where you had to ski down a seemingly endless slope, while dodging trees and rocks, and sometimes a yeti would pop out and chase you. 
i vaguely remember this game so i guess my answer is yes?
Does Reddit have any love for Elf Bowling?
I memba!

Please someone make a multiplayer version of this.
yesssssssssssssss
Loved that game
YES my grandparents had it
Oh my god I used to love this game
holy crap you bought back some memories!
Oh man I played this so much in elementary school  
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!  .. when I was a boy in Shanghai on a pentium 1 pc with a 33.6 modem, and a glory voodoo card. 
Totally forgot about this. Thank you!
Some serious Member Berries right there...
Commenting for later :) loved this game
Holy shit!
Wasn't this on Coffee Break Arcade? 
Was there a game like this that was actually bloody and violent in a way?  I vaguely remember some gore.q
I remember I used to hide everyone in the corner and drag 1 guy out at the time to win this.
The way this is set up gives me terrible flashbacks to Harvest Moon: Back To Nature's tomato festival.
Yep. The whole computer class played it for weeks back in middle school. '99 - '00, somewhere around there.
Coffee Break Arcade, Funny Junk, and Math Circus were the reason to show up for computer class

Yeah, I did played! :)
Aw shit I remember this! I remember being on the top of the leaderboards once! Good times!
Yup!  And the half-naked bowling elves.
When the olympics were here in Salt Lake back in 2002 my family went to the olympic village where they had a "world of tomorrow" type of building. In there Samsung had a booth that was a huge table with a few of there first smartphones ever which were all hooked up to play this game with each other and when you'd throw a snowball it would show up on the table as a light flying at the other players. It was pretty awesome and I dont know how long I stayed playing it, but every once in a while I have a flashback of this game and that table setup. I didn't think the game was ever a thing really so this thread has kind of blown my mind.
This looks way too new to have existed when I was a kid.
So many memories
Commenting to come back to this later, awesome game.
No, I'm pretty sure you were literally the only one. 
Yeah...this just brought back a ton of memories. Literally forgot about his massacre until now. Thank you
As a guy who grew up in a country where is doesn't snow, this gave me an idea of what it's like to play with snow. Good old days
Wait anyone have link to a playable version?
OMG dude please tell me this game is still around!!!!
Yeah, wow..
Holy shit! Yes!
Yes, and then shortly afterwards there was a chain email telling everyone that it was a virus.
What about elf bowling. I liked that more. 
I'd play Snowcraft and SkiFree every time December rolled around. Loved those games.
Had a roommate who played it all the time in college... now I feel old.

phew
Looks way too new for me to play as a kid. I played this tho http://www.classicplastic.net/dvgi/publications-RTMindieSkiOrDie-01.jpg oh memories
Classic.
No?
no just you
Yes! I got this game as an email attachment. It got boring pretty quick once I figured it out. levels just start repeating. 
Played it in Habbo hotel...I wonder if Habbo is still around. That was my jam back in middle school 
No youre the only person ever. 
Yep
OMG!!!! THIS AND THAT SANTA BOWLING GAME WHERE HE WOULD DROP HIS BUM FLAP TO MOON YOU


Damn, this brings back memories. 
I remember playing it a few times, I forget what it's called though.
I still remember that they had a killer sound affect
YES! Grade 7 computer class mental get-away. Thank-you for the dose of nostalgia.
It's been well over a decade since last time, but I remember this clear as a bell!
you still can play it.

If anyone asks for any winter game - give them link to this game (or game itself if you have it)
I sucked at it, so I wouldn't play it. But hell yeah, I remember :p
Hahaa! Good old days!
Fond memories of playing for the first time. Got to the level where the red kids just line up right in front of you and waste you.
Always thought it was a South Park related game when I was a kid. 
I remember playing this as a kid but barely remembers how, where and when I played it. 
OOF 
UGH
BEW PAHHHHHHHHHH

DUN NUH NUH NUH
I remember we always tried to play this game in elementary, but the pc's were not good enough to run it with more then a frame per second.
This and Oregon Trail were the only reason I got up for school each morning.
Thankyou so much for this. So much.
That sweet nostalgia
Oh my gosh! Thanks for the memories of losing, getting mad and losing again.
I only remember playing the neopets clone of this game... [Grundo Snowthrow](http://images.neopets.com/games/g31_graveyard.swf)
omg yeah!
I think I beat it once, and then it asked for my email address so that it could tell me about additional releases.

They never emailed me.
yes i did in my old computers at the computerlab. very nice game
I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THIS GAME! Thanks for bringing it back for me!
Too old for this :)  but give me wing commander 1 or "ski or die" 
gave those motherfuckers concussions
holy crap, yes
Didn't super Mario 64 (ds) have a version of this?
I remember playing a game sort of like this on an old T-Mobile flip phone.
I lived with my grandparents for a while, and this was one of the 2 games my grandpa had installed on his computer. Taking me back 16 years, man.
my brother and i played this for hours and hours every time we finished school and had to stay back waiting for the bus.
At my school, we have competitive snowcraft to see who gets more points faster.
My snowball fighting game was in Ski or Die:

Yeah!
This and Bubble Trouble
kid. i was probably 20
OMG been looking for this for years! Thank you!
No, but it looks fun
That fucking laughter when you lose
I remember playing it. As an adult. At work. 
Oh my god I forgot this existed..
One of my buddies shared this with me on a floppy disk. Truly one of the first great time wasters.
As a kid? No, but I did play it a few years ago when I was still an adult. 
Yeah, except I used dirt and rocks because I live in the desert known as CA
Good times! I remember that I would only play with one. And the rest I would drag as far as I could to the corners of the screen to avoid getting hit. Just to use them as spare lives. Haha
Damn good times.
Yes! downloading after work.. There was also a evil santa game where you could fly around the outside of his northpole house with guns and missiles to kill flying evil elves. there was only one level but I can't remember the name of the game.. Anybody?
I played this and Wulfram II religiously. I miss those days 
Nahh ... only in reality 
OH MY GOSH!! I literally played this in Elementary school & I was so sad to never find it!
I shall play when I get home
I 'member.

No internet at home so I go to school, wait for computer time log on check the new Homestar, play some flash games except Newgrounds was blocked so you gotta find the SFW flash games.

I use to think Newgrounds was cool based on the simple fact I knew it existed but was never allowed to check it out, it was this mysterious awesome thing.

I'm not sayin' Newgrounds isn't cool cuz thats where I found Sonic Boobs...gimme the chocolate!
Packaged this as an executable wrapped in Sub7 and sent to all my friends, family and acquaintances over E-Mail and ICQ way back in the day. Fun times were had.
When they were a kid??? Crap, I'm old... 
remindme! 6 hours
Nope, you are literally the only one that played that game ever.
I used to play the real thing, way more fun.

Bad Rats 2. 
DOOM.

Hands down the best FPS I've played in the last 5 (even 10) years. It knows what it is, doesn't fuck around, and has a great difficulty span for all players. Looks really really good, too. I haven't had so much fun with a game in a long time. And isn't that what it's all about anyway?
The Last of Us. There wasn't even a hesitation
Bioshock Infinite deserves at least a recognition in this list, but I do have to say that Battlefield 1 is pretty amazing.
Of strictly the last 5 years? These are all pretty strong contenders.

The Witcher 3

The Last of Us

Dark Souls or Bloodborne

Minecraft (technically not released until 2011)

Portal 2

As for strongest impact on gaming? Probably Minecraft in terms of its sheer influence on culture, it really is the new "Nintendo". Merchandise, mainstream popularization of Let's Players, appeal to all ages, etc.

Best story? (As far as good videogame stories go) is probably a toss-up between Last of Us and Witcher.  As a standalone definitely Naughty Dog's but as someone who has began by reading The Witcher books I've personally got to give it to CD Projekt Red.

Dialogue? Portal 2.

Gameplay? Probably gotta go with pretty much any of the Bloodsouls series.

You could make a strong argument for *The Last of Us*.  

Edit: Honorable mentions for *Portal 2* and *GTAV*.  
Skyrim.
The last of us. 
Best campaign of a shooter... I'd have to say Doom. Followed by a Titanfall 2 extremely close. 

For RPG, I thought dragon age inquisition was a blast. 
From an artistic and story based stand point I'd argue Life Is Strange or Beyond 2 Souls.

Otherwise if we're just talking about what will get me karma I'd say Witcher 3 and then follow up with saying Fallout 4 is bad
I'd say it's between the last of us, the Witcher 3 and Uncharted 4, but that's like, my opinion man.
That's a very wide area to call for one game, for me personally it would have to be a few games, way to hard to pick one. 

The last of us both original and remaster 
Borderlands 2
Call of duty black ops zombies ( for me I loved it so much, put so much time and love into playing it)
Skyrim
The witcher 3

Dark Souls for me. Still nothing really competes, it really stuck to me.
I will say Dark Souls had the biggest impact on me.
Minecraft.

Well technically Flappy Bird, but otherwise Minecraft.
This game is so damn fun. Sadly no multiplayer on the PS4.
Its an Indian Action Movie
Cool guys don't look at explosions but man do they feel it
[Here is the video to hear how crazy it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9nLZTTJiS4&feature=youtu.be)
When I attempted to play this game it was so fucking glitchy 
I don't get it, am I missing something?  I understand it's a FFXV reference 
skinny penis
I think the only one with a heart in that orientation is the flowery *Destiny's Embrace* http://www.khwiki.com/Destiny's_Embrace, with some extra work it cold probably turn into a reasonable Oathkeeper or Oblivion though http://www.khwiki.com/File:Oathkeeper_KH.png http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/deadfantasy/images/1/1d/Oblivion_KH.png/revision/latest?cb=20110201185305
And this here is why you don't get a tattoo to represent a SO.
Why doesn't she just get a new lock? 
Want to change it into a keyblade that looks the closest to the work that's already done. 
There is a lot of mass near the bottom so not a lot of keyblades "fit" unless you want it rotated with the blade pointing to your elbow. As is, I would suggest the [darkblade.](http://i403.photobucket.com/albums/pp116/sigfrid_300/Kingdom%20hearts/Dark_Keyblade.jpg)
Get a lock on the other arm. Or just a cheesy ghostbusters pickup line. 
Are you gonna update once it's done
jungle key blade is the best

More hilarious because Wayne Simmonds was on the Kings 
I can tell by your selection of games we could be friends.
I'd move up too...if I wasn't dirt poor lol
Yo, get Rocket League.

Trust me
Bloodborne is the goat
That... is a fantastic start to your PS4. 
You and me both! We got the same 2 free games, I also bought the Uncharted 1-3 Nathan Drake Collection.

Then Skyrim SE

Then The Witcher 3 Complete

Then Final Fantasy X remaster

Then Final Fantasy XV...Merry Christmas to me!
Good black friday to you sir
I'm Still on Ps3 XD
why is bloodborne European?
I didn't play Last of Us on PS3 and recently finished remastered version on PS4. 

Damn that was the best game I've played in forever, top 5 of all time, and I've been playing games for 30+ years. 
Good choice buddy, enjoy 
Bloodborne is so hard. I have no idea where to go or how to take down some enemies. I dont know how anyone made it through this game without looking up walkthroughs and stuff but I love it and hopefully one day years from now I'll beat it.
Noice.  Get some multiplayer games ;)

What's ur sn?
I just got PS4 the other day, if you wanna add me my username is ScionOfAll
How much did u pay ? I want to know the deal u got cuz here PS4 with all the Uncharted Games cost 329€ (only on black friday) 
Going to warn you now, they won't let you pick your own background like you were able to on the PS3. You have to buy their themes. I was so irritated when I moved up and found that out. 
yeah, i just bought mine too


Uncharted is the best among all i played! \m/
Guys, I'm a new PS4 pro owner and I just want to ask if it's necessary for me to have a ps plus subscription to play online multiplayer. I normally only play single-player games but I thought I might as well give online multiplayer a try and am planning to pick up Infinite Warfare for the same.
Good mix of games to keep you busy for a while! Enjoy! 
UC4 is a masterpiece.
I highly recommend The Witcher 3. Its fantastic 
How much did you pay for that?
I got the same exact things, on Black Friday. Great minds think alike after all
Ratchet & Clank is awesome. I highly recommend it.
play ratchet and clank/last of us, before you play bloodborne.

once you play bloodborne, nothing else will compare.  
there's a new Ratchet & Clank??? brb buying a PS4
If you're living on a tight budget, one way I learned to save money is with Gamefly. I signed up for 2 games out at a time and I while I'm playing one, the other one is being sent and a new game is coming in the mail. 

I can usually play 4-5 games in a month, which means every month I'm saving over $100-$200. Down side is, you don't get to own the games but I usually only play it once and send it back anyways. 
Guys...there's a new ratchet and clank game out?

They were my shit when I was a kid. Countless hours on my ps2
Ah man I am super jealous you get to experience Bloodborne for the first time. Its such an amazing game and i have no doubt you will have a blast. And die a lot of course ;)

Great selection of games mate! Enjoy :)
Get Infamous second son! It's really fun and the graphics are crazy looking
Just recently got my PS4 from my PS3 as well. You'll love it. Last of Us Remastered looks gorgeous, I am currently 2/3 of the way through it for the first time. Masterpiece.

Bloodborne is a faster paced Dark Souls. I prefer DS myself, but Bloodborne is hella fun.
Just some advice. Get PS Plus.  You WILL NOT regret it. 
Haha still playing on my moms old 2002 gateway PC lucky bastard
Should of gone with PC ez trigger
Oh my god, that Bloodborne cover looks fucking amazing! Much, much better than the American version (though, that one ain't bad either).
I moved up.  Got sad.  Wanted all my games back.  So I bought my ps3 back.  As well as a ps2. 
Spend money to get more of the same and even fewer options. :/
But will the sale continue with it being 53% off that entire time?
My friends has EA Access and wants to try Titanfall 2. It's the 30th now, but he cant see where the trial option is. Is it not up yet?
/r/tipofmyjoystick
What year/ish?
Got my answer! The game I was thinking of was [DROD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_Rooms_of_Death) (Deadly Rooms of Death)
So they throw a update at players after how long? 
This is what I expected PokemonGo to be like!

This is due to screen space reflections and the sampling that is done around an area. What your seeing at the edge is the inability to sample reflections from areas/pixels where are not rendered/visible.
no this is probably the best the ps4 can do. creating reflections is very intensive graphic wise. and the game already runs at 30 fps... 
Having done a lot of 3D modeling as well as spending a lot of time on water I have to say this is actually pretty accurate especially when you compare it to the realistic nature of the people.
/u/VauIt-Tec summed it up succinctly. Up until recently the trend has been that people have been buying their consoles over a PC even though there are advantages *to* a PC; now that hardware on the xbox one is improving to the degree where *really* they're somewhere around the range of a medium spec PC, they're having to change their strategy up a little.
Because then people wouldn't buy an Xbox. 

Think about it. I can illegally download Windows on my PC, and then illegally download their exclusives. Microsoft will get $0 from me.

Or

Have exclusives be a Xbox thing and have me buy a (whatever they cost now? I think $240?) console and the game. Microsoft wins.
Any Microsoft published games will be on both for all of eternity going forward.

if its just on Xbox that means its not published by MS and they have no say if that publisher also designed it for PC or PS4
You can get many games from the Windows Store (PC).  In fact, Xbox Play Anywhere has many of the new exclusive Xbox games available to play on Windows 10 PC/Laptops including ReCore, Gears of War, and Forza.  Quantum Break is also available on both Windows Store and Steam.

It's happening slowly.  


Keeps the console competitive.  Many people own a PC, and many of those want to buy another console.  If you can get a bunch of exclusives on your pc already, then no reason to get an Xbox.  

Of course now they are changing their strategy a bit.  PC gaming has gotten rather large, so now you more than make up for any loss in exclusivity with the increased sales.
Wait... Let me get this straight.

You bought Mirror's Edge Catalyst, it ran poorly on your PC and you want an EA customer support representative to... fix it and make it run better? Is that about right?

Not only did he give you all your money back, but he also gave you 15% off vouchers. Incredible.

I have no idea what you were expecting... If a game performs poorly, it is the job of the developer to fix it. This guy did his job and issued you a full refund and even went beyond to give you vouchers. Serious question, what were you expecting him to do? Wave a magic wand that would allow you to get 60fps on ultra settings?

My mind is absolutely blown right now.
Man if all call centers would start with "do you want me to refund your purchase or" I would be a happy camper. There is a language barrier and he probably hates his life but it's not like he was rude or anything.
Did anyone actually read the conversation or just react based off the title? OP was being a dick because the other guy isn't a magic genie. "fix the issue or give me a refund"  "I can't fix it, it will be fixed in a future version, here is a refund."  "no fix it!" 

In b4 you work for ea jokes
Holy entitlement, Batman.

"I'd prefer you'd solve the issue"
"if that's not possible then I will have the refund"

How exactly do you expect a person in "Customer Experience" to fix your issue? He's not a tech, or a programmer, or anything on the development or QA team for Mirror's Edge Catalyst or any other EA game. Surinder gave you the only option he had available to him and issued you a refund, which, according to your post, you absolutely asked for. If you didn't want the refund as an option on the table, you should not have asked for one.

Did you try the ACTUAL support section on their website first? How about checking the forums to see if someone else had a similar issue and could recommend a workaround? Or was it just less work to badger a customer service rep to attempt to shit a magical solution out of his ass for you?

Be thankful Origin even offers refunds.
"I just want it to be working"
"Okay, re-download it and we'll give you 15% off for your trouble"
"No, I just want it to work"

if I were that guy I would be hating you.
Dear diary, today OP was a massive cock. 
I feel sorry that that customer service worker had to deal with you. 
Yet you are still going to give them your money. 
Life is hard
Shut up
Soooooo, dunno how to say this but India is the revolving door on customer support.  Many of the job applications that come in indicate that these people have worked for several other reputable companies.  I've managed teams for both IBM and McCain foods for quite some time now...and when they contract out to "Offshore support" this is pretty typical.  This is both in their "phone support roles" and anything having to do with application and server admin roles.

I don't know if you can really blame EA on this, as there choice on what individuals say via chat or phone support is limited seeing as the average turn around for 1 employee sticking around is anywhere between 4-8 months and at times can honestly care less what they say to the client.

If larger companies like this really do care about customer support, it'd be nice that jobs and roles like this stop being outsourced...honestly sucks that you got screwed over.

>If that's not possible then I will have the refund.

What were you expecting?


I just read the entire post and everyone's comments. What shitty service would you be exposing? The fact that your game had a glitch or the great customer service you received? This isn't about call centers being in India and people lasting 4-8 months. This is about some God awful atrocity you faced because you didn't get a patch for your game. I think I have this correct. 

So if you got the owner of EA on the phone (or chat) and tried to plead your case you would say that you only asked him to refund your money if it couldn't be corrected. He then proceeds to tell you that it's an ongoing problem, that he obviously can't correct, and since you're so fucking distraught over it he refunds your money for you to do what you please with it and tells you that since it means so much to you you can download it again and here's 15% off for being a whining little bitch? The guy then tells you that they are aware of this issue which is why he gave you your money back after certain time period when they don't usually issue them. What is your case? What would you then tell the EA owner? Oh I know, you didnt get what you REALLY REALLY REALLY WANTED.  Well the guy is not Santa Clause. 

That's like crying over the fact that you bought a stale box of cereal and you go back to the store and complain about it and say "this box was stale when I opened it and I just bought it, can you fix it?" The service rep says, 'do you want me to fix it or refund your money. What do you really really want?" You say that you really really want this box of cereal to not be stale. Well the service rep can't do that for you so she gives you your money back and says to buy another box. You then say that's not what I REALLY REALLY WANTED so the the service rep gives you 15% coupons for more cereal and you then ask for her boss to try and get the person fired because you have to walk your spoiled ass back down the Isle to get a new box ( uninstall and reinstall the game). 

FUCKING MILLENNIALS

Man, he did the best refund + 15% discount, and you still complaining... 
if you ACTUALLY want to hear about some un-fucking-believable support, look up some of the HTC support for the vive
EA guy did what he could. 

You were doing the equivalent of complaining to Walmart that you get low frames on the CoD game you bought. Retard. 
1) There was no chance that EA customer support is going to fix a buggy game because one person asked the support center to.  If the game was made crappily, the best you could hope for is a refund.
2) You got a refund, ridiculously quickly, I might add.
3) Then you bought it again?!  Seriously?
I don't understand. You requested a refund, and got it instantly. Why was it such bad customer service? If they can't fix the issue, they can't fix the issue. You've obviously never dealt with Straight Talk or Sprint.
Bruh I'm dyinnnn at the fact that every response OP gives is being downvoted into oblivion
Typical kid of this whiney generation 
Are they trained to grind you down until you are forced to accept their offer? That's what that looks like.
Probably had a corrupted install but he didnt explain it right?
Not at all surprised. EA is seriously scum. 
Classic EA. 
EA is notoriously incompetent and horrible.
Yeah I got screwed on buying some Dragon Age Origins add-ons. I went through the chat like this and after a long time and all the back and forth he told me there was nothing they could do for me, no refund or anything. I kept pushing and he said tech support will email me. 

So they did email me 1 or 2 days later asking about the problem and etc. I explained it again and said that I would like a refund. That was over a month ago and they have still not written me back. I emailed the same guy 2 more times and they just completely stopped answering me. 

I've never seen a customer service so bad who just completely ignores a problem.
I found this conversation quite funny though. Please let us know if re-downloading the game really fixed the issue or did absolutely nothing!
Hey at least they have fucking support unlike steam all you idiots praise lmfao
when i read the title i thought you had a good experience with EA support because its "un fucking believable" to actually get through their thick skulls  
I bet there's also a technical issue *in btween* his brain.
More reasons to stop giving EA money.  If enough people would stop giving them money, they'd either change or (ideally) go away.

There are always good, great, or even fantastic games being made by a variety of developers all over the world and released by a variety of publishers.  Not all companies are terrible.  There's no _great_ reason to continue to pay for shit (service) when there are alternatives.

Edit: Whole bunch of people in this thread are too fucking stupid to read.  The guy bought a game on sale.  He had an issue with it.  Before asking or doing _anything_ else, the rep _immediately_ refunded it and told him to buy it again to fix the issue... after it was no longer on sale.  OP said that even including the 15% voucher, the re-purchase will still be more than what he initially paid for it.
The NPC interaction is the thing that most makes that game world jump to life. I adore GTA V and all it did to create the living, breathing Los Santos, but Watch_Dogs 2 nailed NPC interaction.
It's a shame this game or WD1 got a huge player count free roam.
Previous comments are trolling you. Each game has a stand alone story. There are a few Easter eggs you will miss out on but nothing game breaking. 
lol, responses are trolling you.  all main FF titles are basically completely different games with different stories, worlds, characters. etc.  you're fine starting anywhere (unless it's made obvious in the title, like X-2 or XIII-2).

that said, i understand the underlying frustrating because this question has been asked here like a thousand times in the past 48 hours.  you should really google this stuff yourself. 
No. you will miss out on decades worth of lore and story. The only way to get the complete picture of what is going on is to play them in order.
all you need to watch to play FFXV in theory to not miss story is the anime that accompanies it. Brotherhood is a mini-series and Kingsglaive is a movie, and apparently they both cover events that happen before the start of the game.

As far as playing previous FF games, FFXIV was an MMORPG with a completely unrelated story, so the previous game have basically nothing to offer. Additionally, the setting in this one is probably the most modern of all of them, meaning missing lore and such will be less important (there are smart phones and cars in this one!)
I dunno. Should you start watching Game of Thrones in the middle of Season Six if you've never seen a single episode?

The Wire set in a fictional town, describing a protagonist that rises from the ranks of average members of an average gang because of his guts and fearlessness, which is eventually revealed to be horrible, crippling insanity as his or her world unravels around them one day at a time, leaving them somewhere on the verge of still active and prominent in a gang to dead or comatose and dreaming of everything else that happens. 
It's basically GTA but a more silly and funny side. It's better in my opinion, has a coop story mode but sadly no real online.
GTA but better. It realises that the player is there to fuck around so everything is oriented around that.

Anyone who thinks Saints Row 2 was serious is a fucking idiot.
A combination of GTA and /r/im14andthisisfunny
Saints Row tells the story of a person rising through the ranks of a violent street gang, and then becoming an international celebrity before ultimately becoming the president.  After this, aliens attack earth, and the person becomes Neo from The Matrix, and also the devil fits in there somewhere, too.
The deposit you made should come right off the price of the game.  I just picked up a preorder ten minutes ago, and the 5$ deposit I made came off the price of the game.  I couldn't imagine it's any different for you.
Thanks guys exactly the info I needed Hopefully should pick it up tomorrow a bit cheaper :D and Games still good had bad experiences with amazon games preorders and game's always helpful, just need to be aware of the price but usually still cheaper than the xbox/ psn stores as they pricey AF XD
Stop preordering game and shopping at GameStop.
/r/me_irl
I would love to know this as well
It went *okay*
Well metacritic is in the 80's last time i looked. And the XV sub is mostly positive.  i would head over there and read up on some people impressions as they have talking a great deal about whats good and bad.

 Also it's FF so you can't really rely on anyone's judgement as we all look at individual games in the series differently. A good example is I am still surprised at how many people liked 8.
It's not without it's flaws so go in with an open mind, but the game is outstanding and if you haven't seen much gameplay footage then you are in for a real treat.
the story is quite shitty with a bad ending, but the rest is ok
Mobile games used to be good, but then in-app purchases were introduced and the freemium game market was born which is killing the game industry as a whole.
Instead of charging one price and providing a fun and engaging game experience, freemium game developers are making the laziest types of games, making them impossible to complete, and make you pay money to achieve any kind of meaningful progression.
crap. there's only so much you can do on a touchscreen
Tbh I've tried. The furthest I went was on Minecraft pe but that was since we were at school and during recess and we all outgrew it. We had a blast and everything was great but I can safely say that it is towards you get children. We were in grade 9 at the time so that's why it appealed to us. Right now personally, I have maximum 1 game installed on either phone I carry and I never even open it. I think it just comes with maturity (not necessarily age) that people start using their phones practically. I still game on my PC of course but right now both my phone's are dedicated for work and their own purposes.
Only game I play is PVZ. So I think it's pretty blahhh
I'm addicted to CoC and I'm enjoying Final Fantasy Brave Evixus. Mobile gaming is not as bad as I thought  it was.
At the moment i have no choice.  My laptop shit itself and it will take months to save for a new computer.

I've been playing Little Big City 2 and Skyforce Reloaded. They are both decent and not reliant on "social" aspects to compete tasks
I got a micro to usb adapter and can use a controller. Not gonna play for hours on it though.
Fallout is love, Fallout is life.
I play Majora's mask yearly.
dishonored 2 because with all the alternative paths you can take the replay value is insane ❤️
The first *Max Payne*. John Woo mixed with Film Noir? What's not to love?

I still remember the cheat code to unlock all weapons.
For me, one has got to be Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. The story, gameplay, characters, art, music--everything is well done so it makes for a very immersive and enjoyable low-intensity RPG. Plus even though I've played through at least 5 times in my life, I know there are a handful of fun side missions I still haven't touched.

(I don't even like "real RPG's" much but The Thousand Year Door was right up my "casual gamer" alley.)
My friends and I have been setting up a HaloCE lan once a year ever since 2002.  Most of us were very addicted to the game when it first came out, and we used to lan all the time.  Now that we're all older we can't do it every weekend or whatever, so we just do it once a year.

The game blew us away when we all first got it...going from Goldeneye to HaloCE in 01 was pretty mind blowing, and the game has stuck with us.
usually baldurs gate 2 or torment
Well, it's gonna sound very stupid, but Minecraft is the one in my case. I started playing PC games because of it and now I play all sorts of games everyday. And I think I will always have time for some mini-game or to visit my world. Actually, just for the nostalgia, I started a server some months ago with my friends (didn't play it for like 1-2y or maybe I played it, but very few times) and we're loving getting the feelings back! I think I will always revisit this game once every few years over my life, it's special for me.



Kingdom Hearts 2 for me. Love the story, love the world, love the characters, love everything about it! Although it's mostly nostalgia; it was the first rpg I played for the ps2. Also, the sephiroth fight is a lot of fun. I have a save file that's saved right before the fight, just so I could relive it (and re-experience all the rage from getting him down to one hit and dying before my finisher hits him)
Silent Hill 2. Unravelling such a masterpiece never gets old.
So many but phantasy star online is my go to.
Dr. Mario

They keep releasing new versions of the game with new systems.  Turned into one of my favorite multiplayer, online games.
Monkey Island.

I've played the first two at least 10 times each and they still keep me entertained.

Halo CE, that game is still good by todays standards and i love it

GTA San Andreas.. Best open world game.. Always reminds my childhood.. 
Final Fantasy 7 no doubt I've put 1000s of hrs into it still haven't mastered all the matera or beaten the weapons
MW2.  It's my favorite FPS ever.  
You do know that they made all gameplay specific DLC free and that the only micro transactions are cosmetic. 

Do you?
It's a brilliant way of supporting the game. Doesn't force you to pay to get new content you just get stuff early and cosmetic extras.
I hope you are joking because R6 has one of the best dlc policy's I've ever seen how the fuck is what they are doing wrong?
I hear you, but the way this game does it is good. The only advantage to a pass is you get the operators 1 week early. After that maps and operators are free for everyone. 

Now a game like Destiny for example does the season pass terribly. 
Eh. Depends. I'm more on the side of, if the development team is striving to improve the game, whilst also keeping the game fresh, then I'm all for purchasing a season pass to show my support. I bought the season pass for R6S early on because I immediately felt something special about it. Same thing with BF4 and BF1, and I'll be getting this season pass too. Some game devs are money grabbers with that shit though
Please explain how this is wrong?
Worth 60, no. Worth maybe 30? I think so. If they roll out 3 or so updates this big I'd say it'd be totally worth it.
No, because that developer deserves to be punished with zero sales. If we reward this kinda thing then no one will ever change.
No. 
No, man.
No idea. Noone's playing it.
Suppose that depends on your internet...i installed entire 50gb digital in 2 hours
I had it installed in about an hour. Check your internet. Maybe restart the console and continue the install.
a game thats alot of fun for upto 4 local players is overcooked.
My wife and I love playing Diablo 3 and Skylanders Imaginators. 
Rocket League, Party Golf, and Towerfall Ascension. Out of the three I would say Rocket league is the most fun, but I haven't played too much of Towerfall Ascension. I haven't played any Party Golf but it caught my eye recently.
Because of Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales going on. Maybe $150. In a month or two. I would say $200.
$150
What games do you want to play? That's quite low end, it won't play new games all that well. You could probably do better for that budget if you built it yourself
It's a piece of crap. Especially the GPU.
It a decent choice, you should recommend buying it
Everything looked okay until I seen the GPU, its terrible. need to find one with a gtx 700-900. not GT

It would be helpful if we knew your budget and which games you hope to play. I would say this machine will get you the majority of 2016 games at a very low graphic setting and likely low fps.
everything about this computer is good except for the Graphics card.  You're not going to be playing anything decent on that card unless you upgrade it.  You can probably find a GTX 980 for cheap
No.
I would recommend going to r/buildapc and getting advice on building one yourself. Most gaming pc companies give only a year for parts warrenty. Each part on its own has 2-5 years of warranty. Do not go with a prebuilt if you wish to spend wisely. The power supplies come from a craptastic company in china 
if there is a microcenter near you pickup a fx6300 and motherboard bundle for around $90. just buy the parts for your pc separately, you can build one cheap using deals on parts. i built mine in February and i got an fx-6300, asus motherboard, 16gb evga ddr3 1800mhz ram, 1tb high performance hdd  gaming hdd, and a Gigabyte R9-380 2gb gpu all for $330. i already had a pc case and Corsair CX600 power supply laying around.

Those are solid points to reference, but you might consider also touching on the downsides of game evolution instead of just nostalgia feels I think it's more relatable if you have an opinion on it instead of just a history lesson.    

To me gaming has evolved a lot of ways but also digressed. Games feel less like passion projects and more like they are just trying to pack in all the feature buzzwords. Copy-cat games are at an all time high, not only do we love to just up-res old games and sell them for full price, but also once a new type of game gets success the market gets flooded with clones. There is also all the SJW crap that has infested gaming lately.    

sorry for the pessimism, but I think we are advancing in tech but going backwards in community and innovation.
Easy answer: Absolutely.

To answer in your order,
Journalism: We've seen it get ugly as there aren't many left. And most are questioned about being biased or not. Wondering how much effect the publishers have over reviews and such.

Leads: As society changes, so does this. Stories are getting more and more intricate. 

Voice Acting: Hollywood as slowly creeped in. Good or bad, we have many big name stars doing voices of big characters.

Power of Publishers: In my opinion this is a big topic, we have seen the greed. We have seen how they push more and more games out the door early with the thought of 'we'll fix them later'. 

Rise of online gaming: Good and bad has come from this. We have seen great games get expansions thanks impart to DLC. We have seen the negative with day 1 DLC, microtransactions, shipping broken/incomplete games.

Amount of Developers: Seems like numbers are getting smaller but hard to actually say from my perspective.

Real world issues: Usually wrapped in science fiction or such, but I can think of Deus Ex and how it showed govt takeover due to crisis. Segregation, racism, and such., Even conspiracy theoires.

How gamers are teated?: Not sure other than viewing us as a customer. 

Advancing tech: We have always seen new technology but picking out what will last and what will fade hasn't been easy. Wii blew up and slowly faded away. Will VR do the same?
Yes.  That's why I moved from semi-rural Nevada to Phoenix.  $100/month for 10 lousy GB via satellite.

Fuck that.
Used too but also back in the day on dial up which would be patchy at best and fuck up if it rained. Just had to deal with it, not in finding a solution but putting up with it. Once thumb drives became a thing I would download things at the library because it had much better internet than my house. Used to get patches like that. Pain in the butt though.
Try LAN parties with friends instead! No internet needed! Or try playing through a back log of older games. 
I believe there's an option to stop the PS4 from updating the OS and games from updating as well.
A friend of mine had that problem. He ended up just turning his phone into a wireless hot spot. I can't remember which provider he uses, but he gets unlimited data for 200ish a month. Expensive, but he thought it was worth it.
I live in a rural area too. If we moved into town we *might* be able to get ADSL, providing Telstra are releasing ports to the town again.  8mbit down, 300k up. But there's no places to rent in town,  and there's no guarantee we'd even get it.  For the past  6 months I've been stuck on a mobile plan that gives me 500mb of data per $2.
Well you can actually get forza on the windows 10 store. But I'm not 100% sure but project cars might have engine swaps and such. I'm not sure though. 
Have a look at The Crew...
Project cars?
I had this happen to ignis. But he was only translucent not transparent 
Its not status affect or anything and he doesn't need a Phoenix down. Anyone else have this problem?

Dead space 2
Saints Row The Third, Starbound, Stardew Valley, Path Of Exile, Victor Vran, The Crew (if it's cheap)
Try something like Far Cry, Uncharted, Tomb Raider - they are all super fun. And because I am obsessed = Destiny.
Stardew Valley might be your thing if you enjoyed Harvest Moon. 
Could always give Faster Than Light (FTL) a try. It's a Rouge-like game that I like to use when I have short amount of free time, and don't want to get too invested in a game.
Path of Exile?
Fallout 4
The witcher 3? 
Garry's mod, even back when you needed a source game to piggy back on it really stretched the boundaries of a sandbox game.

And I thought noclipping through half life 2 was fun, OH BOY was I amazed
Fallout 3 and New Vegas
Try warframe.
The Binding of Isaac!
>fun to play at short intervals, kind of casual, single player, crafting and base building are a plus but not necessary and PC only don't have a console atm.

Terraria
Ark survival evolved. Just the beta out now, but nice getting free updates every month. Full release late springish
If you have a 3DS Monster hunter Generations offers the same old fun with a lot of new features to really change up the series.

Enderal is a free mod for Skyrim if you have it on PC.  30-100 hour campaign, no joke.  Little buggy but pretty solid overall.

Seeing you have a PSP look up the game Freedom Wars.  Plays like Monhun/God eater sorta.

Witcher 3 for the obligatory suggestion, great open world rpg.

For the harvest moon itch Get Stardew Valley on PC.  Also recommend the Rune Factory series.
killing floor

or killing floor 2. its EA was sketchy but now its more good than bad IMO.

both games are wave based zombie shooters - pretty simple but it has a really high skill ceiling - lots of depth in how you can play and an active community. and the gameplay is just really satisfying. fast paced dumb fun. its nothing like l4d or cod zombies.

i have 575hrs in kf1 and 200 in kf2 although i have seen people with 3k+ hrs in kf1. there is just something so satisfying about the gameplay, when you die its because you fucked up. long games go for about 1/2hrs. thats 10 waves, but you can have 4 wave games which are really short.
The Witcher 3
Darksouls 1 or 3
They said a while back that they we're going to make cosmetic purchases available, but no in-game currency you need to grind for. They're still firmly sticking to no game-changing purchases will be made at any time.

I have no quarrel with cosmetic-only paid content.
Dude, it's been posted all over the place that it's nothing but cosmetics. Their website, reddit, every "news" site that pretends to be good at videogames, youtube.

Take five damn seconds to read about something before you start posting shit, just five pretty please with a cherry on top.
if it is just vanity items i wouldn't be mad at all
> Remains to be seen if it affects gameplay

No it doesn't, they repeatedly said that anything that would affect gameplay is free, anything paid is only cosmetic.

They also NEVER said there wouldn't be paid content, they only ever said that anythign that would affect gameplay (maps, weapons, game modes, etc.) would always be free DLC. Most people assumed there would be some sort of paid cosmetic DLC from the start because of all the cosmetic stuff included in the game, and because the Prime Titans had been announced and shown in the Deluxe Edition before the game even released.
They said nothing that would give you an advantage etc. The only thing you can buy is cosmetics. 


Which is fine. 


They haven't gone back on anything they said. 
You really didn't think this through did you?
Tell me more about supply drop weapons in Battlefield 1?

what are these image proportions 
I played through the first Dead Island with three friends from start to finish. It was actually an amazing game in that context. Some of my fond memories:


- "Hey XXXX what's that over there?" "What's what?" *I throw a propane bottle under his feet and shoot it* (this happened a lot)


- I was made the official team driver, which often put us into strange situations. "I don't see any reason why this truck can't make a ninety degree turn on a staircase!" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzowXJz7w8Y)


- By the end of the game I had a weapon which a chance to electrocute enemies, which caused them to drop the the ground and have a seizure. On the very last boss in the game, the climax of the entire playthrough, my gun procced on the very first shot I took. Literally the moment the final boss fight started, he fell to the ground and started flopping around like a fish while we unloaded everything into him and he died before he could stand up. We laughed for like twenty minutes straight.


We actually bought a four pack of the sequel with the intention of doing another team playthrough but we just haven't quite found the time.
Dead Island! Great game. My wife and I LANned the shit out of that game. It was Riptide, actually. That looks like the first one. 
I want a good Dead Island game :/
Despite being a little buggy and not refining many needed aspects of the game in the sequel (Riptide) I loved the Dead Island Series. One of my favorite zombie games, Dying Light was great as well. Still waiting on Dead Island 2.... not sure what's up with that
Sam B was my favorite character 
The sad thing is fists are arguably one of the best weapons in the game for this reason, at least in Riptide. I have fond memories of Fisting my way through zombies hordes in that game. 
"Where the hell did I put that?"

Zombies (for whatever reason) level up with you.
Never forgetti :(
So now we just put gifs of guys getting killed in bf1, wow.

No, he didn't protect you, it wouldn't have touched you anyway.
Part of me was expecting Dickbutt, glad it's #10 though. Good Job
What makes this nsfw?
I wish I had a PS4 so I could jump on the NMS hate but this actually looks pretty cool 
Still looks boring.
Agent 47 blending in as usual.
Holy shit, it's the ["I want to apologize"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg12uhZu9_o) guy!

Poor dude seems to be getting into all kinds of shenanigans.
How you can aggressively film someone ?
That's not so bad for Los Santos

Based on a true story.
Repost repost repost. Get a job OP
Crazy how closely GTA resembles real life.
This reminds me of [Office Bubbles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGMTm3QRwEc). 
Relevant to like a year ago. 
[heres where they got it from, i put it before the part where they shoot his dog, if you dont like that then youre warned](https://youtu.be/WDBZr4ie2AE?t=3m4s)

he was arrested for recording the cops. they dont like when you record them (and in some states its illegal... lol)

cant really expect much more when you give high school graduates with delusions of grandeur a gun and a badge, can you
I just got GTA V on PC (previously played on PS3 and not for a long time and never finished it.)

Literally walked up to a woman as Franklin did absolutely nothing while she was on her cell phone. She stopped, swore at me, then called the police and I got arrested. For being black. 


I'm sooooooooo triggered right now. So much racism in this game I can't even handle it. (I'm kidding in case you can't tell)
nice
Why should  I download from here? Are you silly?
Sounds like a scam to get people's phone data or account data. 
Once again I'm glad I'm not an Indian.
I never played this one. How does this game hold up? Is the story as fun as the old ones? Is there still an online community? Would you say the game at $15 is worth the buy?

I thought the game was programmed to not let this happen...
/r/me_irl
Damn that's sad you still running windows 2k
JFC people is it so hard to put the name of the game in the title?!?
Thanks 2016
[/r/fuck2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fuck2016/)
me too thanks
Get swept.
Brought me back to college lol
Just think, you are one out of 64 people to have something bad happen to you.
IMPOSSIBRU!
I, too like to shoot fat asses. 
*Overweight female feminist triggered*
I just fly around as a whale.
I work in retail and that is just a mistake cuz it's not out yet
Embargo hype!
Walmart is notorious for violating street dates due to poor communication between staff. Odds are those are real and someone screwed up.

Other reason Im saying those are real - marketing boxes aren't covered in cellophane.

They can accidentally put it on the shelf, it happens. If a customer tries to buy it though it'll deny the transaction. 
Source: Walmart employee who had a customer try to buy a Roku 2 before they were released. Whom had a manager come over and explain that items not released cannot be purchased. 
I too am surprised to see Battleborn still on the shelves.
Do you want hemorrhoids?!

Because that's how you get hemorrhoids!
Just imagine all the shit stains that controller will have in a week. 
Now when people hear the game they instantly know you're taking a massive shit
I usually face time myself on my spare phone. Only it's pointed at my TV. So all I have is my tiny phone for a screen and controller.
Hey! I have one of those!
I've never gotten why people do this. Are some people on the toilet for seriously that long? Same with reading a newspaper. When I need to poo, I sit and do my business (takes less than a minute) and start to wipe. I see no time for playing Galaga unless I'm sick and need to sit there a while (which happens maybe once a year).
Get a raspberry pi for the poop deck TV and play a load of old games on it. Would be way better, you can poop and play Pokemon or street fighter, you can clutch whilst you clench
Wow, you're so resourceful and creative and cool. You plugged up a TV underneath your sink 
YES!!! I remember recording this on a cassette tape along with a bunch of other video game endings. Listened to it sooo many times.
Wait... That was written by Dan Harmon? Rick and Morty, Dan Harmon??  
I never knew that.
A really underrated game.
The Summoner...fucking LOVED that game on ps2. 

And yes, one of my all-time favorite easter eggs.
Good old [Dead Alewives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Alewives).
What did I just watch lol
I just realized that's a young Dan Harmon playing the Dungeon Master. I bet he wrote this. That would make  this like a precursor to Harmonquest. 
Giiiiiif
Commenting because really curious about the responses. I'm the exact opposite. I love to play games with a rich story that drag me along for the ride. 

Don't get me wrong, I have no problems playing RL or CSGO for hours with friends, but when I do that my focus is to win. When I'm by myself I can take the time to mess around and do things I normally wouldn't attempt because it could affect my team's performance 
I haven't been able to play a single player game for a very long time, i enjoy talking to much shit with the people i game with. I now struggle to sit down and jam hours on a single player experience. I think Planet Coasters is the only game thats been able to pull me away for more than 5 hours. 
I'm both. I enjoy playing games alone, but also love playing SOME games with friends.
Still fp and u gonna repost... Pathetic
Hello repost my old friend,
You've come to post to me again,
Because a vision softly showing,
Or something I already knowing,
And that vision that was planted in my brain earlier today,
Still remains,
Within the sound of Reddit 
This is still on the hot page of gaming.. 
Gotta love that every single post is a repost, if you want Karma so bad I'll make one out of cardboard and post it to you!
woah, what kind of helmet is that? can you close it?
That wasn't a request, that's a demand. 
yea that packard bell keyboard is pretty good
ah yes le gems
I don't know if it's just because I'm getting older or if screens of today are vivid and bright as hell, but whenever I want to check out my gameboy for shits and giggles I can't see hardly anything
This is my paradise.
You have too much stuff. Maybe a bi-annual tidy in order?
6 Golden Coins.... at a boy
Game boy color with no color games xD What's that fourth pokemon game? I don't remember another regular gameboy pokemon game except for green...
A Packard Bell? I'd hardly call that a gem.
*takes out old collection of gameboy games*

"Le undiscovered hidden gem"

Fuck off with this sympathy shitpost.
and where was it? 
Good games, but you can't play Gold/Silver on a Gameboy Pocket tho
"Hey there"
wait is the menu sideways??
you need try play Mafia 3 in a while doing working
Yes.
It's not really like the witcher but I would say yes, and don't worry about never playing a FF game, It even says before the main menu it's a game for long time fans and new comers to the series.
Each FF is it's own story and world. So missing one doesn't effect playing another. You don't miss out on anything. I definitely recommend the game. 
Knowledge of the other games isn't needed so if it looks interesting then yes go for it.
Get it 
The combat is nothing like the witcher
Yes but don't expect it to be like The Witcher.
What a good question! My favorite thing about the Final Fantasy series is that each one is extremely different from previous ones. That's a rare thing these days, and something I want to reward.

However, the series has been in a bit of a dry spell for me, and I doubt 15 will actually play like the Witcher. I'm on my way to pick up my copy, but if not for my series loyalty, I'd wait for the reviews to settle.
I'd wait at least a few days. Buying from the hyped people who haven't even had time to beat the game, fully explore combat, content, and story, and just from a gameplay video or two, is a risky move. 

The game could be amazing, draw on the lore and backstory they've already developed, or it could drop off halfway at 15 hours in and leave you disappointed. I'd just give it the wait and see treatment, even if you only wait a short time.
No.
Maize looks cool!
Is that minigun firing...missiles?
wow great work
I have also some videos subscribe my channel:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJz2cc436t0
Great game. Battlefield Vietnam was fun too.
The best part about the original BF1942 was the Desert Combat mod. 
And Spiders. Don't forget the spiders. 
Because we've known about it for a long time.
Also no need to get excited until they actually build something
I'm the opposite, why ARE we talking about it? I thought this was basically the same announcement like 2 years ago and it doesn't seem like there is any new info.
Love the last fuck you throw
I don't know how you die from a snowball being thrown at you.
I see the 12 days of reposts has begun.

Wait it's snowing in GTA online right now?!
I SEENT IT 
Seeing things like this makes me want that Bully sequel we all know we deserve. That game was boss, I don't care what anyone else thinks. The mini games were fun, the cliques (and cliches) were fantastic, the world felt somewhat limiting, but that made sense as you were a kid in a boarding school, not some maniac running around with a machine gun.

And for those of you that haven't played it, during the winter semester, it did snow, and you could start school wide snow ball fights. That game was definitely in my top ten for favorite plays on PS2, which is a tough list as the system had many great games. Not only was it fun, it had replayability. I think I finished it three times all the way through, 100% completion.

The bottom line is, snowball fights in GTA Online were alright (might be again if they bring them back) and all, but I want another Bully game. Rockstar, you're making a Red Dead sequel, that's great. People have been asking for it for a long time. But that's a PS3/360 era game. I think the Bully fans have waited patiently enough. Don't make us come over there and stuff you in your lockers. You know we'll do it too. We learned it from watching you. 
That escalated quickly
It's the Los Santos version of the Boston Massacre. 
I remember this gif from last year.
this is 2+ years old
My daily dose of repost.
is the snow back already? im not near my ps4
thought this was /r/watchpeopledie for a sec
This is fucking hilarious 
Immediately thought of [A Million Ways to Die in the West](https://i.imgflip.com/oroaf.gif) when that guy got ran over.
http://karmadecay.com/r/gaming/comments/5f93oa/snowball_fight/
There is snow update in gta5? Wtf. Yesterday i logged in there was no snow to be seen any where...
Laughed so hard when the last snowball was so casually throw at the guy who just had his head run over omg too funny 
Shoulda dressed him as Dwight 
Holy shit. There are so many reposts on /r/gaming right now. More than usual.
It's shit like this that keeps me playing GTA. Also [this.](https://gfycat.com/EnchantedWindingAegeancat)
Well, that snowballed quickly.
...and snow up the asshole for good measure.
When you get into a snowball fight, but the snow is from flint, michigan.
A thrilling reenactment of the Boston Massacre (1770).
can't wait till snow again.  love racing in it makes things a bit more crazy
What game is this? 
Reposters gonna repost. 
Is it snowing in GTA now?
I laughed waaaay too hard at this 
why no game name in the title????
Im getting a ps4 for christmas, so the snow will be gone by the time i get to play :'(
Definitely thought the paramedics were forming their own snowballs in the beginning. I am disappoint.
I was hoping this would be from the PS1 South Park game. Was sad when it wasn't. 
Gonna try this out for sure :)
Now that's what I call an snow angel. 
Haha I laughed
Oh look. This one.

Again.
Well that escalated real quick 
Well that escalated quickly
What game is this?
Is this GTA V? If so, then I'll stop waiting for a better sale and just buy it. 
Yes...this again. I love it.

Thats why you aren't allowed to throw snowballs at school! 
xD

wearing sweet sand verbena !
Lmao
I love the way he continued to throw the snowballs even after the SUV goes over him
To me, it's a video I have not seen.
Repost Fight.
GAME?!
**Love the last fuck you throw**
Is it online 
You know it's officially Christmas season when this gif gets posted.
What game is this?
As soon as I saw GTA I expected those snowballs to explode like grenades. 
I am an EMT... and this.. made my day... lol
Tis the season. Lol
Prank gone wrong
i like bullet.
The good ol' repost
This reminds me of canis canem edit
Nice dodge.
r/hitboxporn
How are you gonna explain this to the police if they would ask you what happened.
It's all fun and games until someone gets decapitated by a car
I want a VR headset and a snowball fight game. Can that happen?
Are those palm trees? 
When does the snow in GTA start again?
GTA Tip: Run him over twice so that way you know he's dead.
When keeping it real goes wrong

The final fuck you snowball. Love it.
better a real one, 
Ummm... if in real world, whose fault?
it is my favorite game 
and here i am signing into gta and being disappointed :(
Is this a mod? 
That escalated quickly.
I have never seen snow in gta.
Well that Escaladed quickly.
This again? ahh what the hell, it's still funny. have an upvote
Is it already arrived? Last year I had a blast.
/r/Unexpected 

Well, that escalated...
I remember this last Christmas on PS4, they made it snow on GTAV for a day.
Lol at the last throw
Wow
Interesting, this is the first time I've seen it
Didn't see that coming. 
It's that time of the year soon again. 
Well that escalated quickly
He took the bait, target eliminated.
I LOVE THIS LMAO
I remember seeing this in /r/watchpeopledie
Gonna be honest, that backward roll was nasty
Merry.. Christmas?
Boston Massacre 1770 (Colorized)
Sike!        Paremedic gets thrown under car
What is this game?
this actually made me laugh.  didnt expect the car to run over his head.
Yep, another repost.
That escalated quickly.
Man. Escaladed quickly
Holy crap that didn't go as intended, or did it?
It's in GTA????
Snow in Los Santos? Global warming really is fucked up
Lol that last snowball xD
This should also be in r/unexpected LOL
Is this a mod or DLC?
Holy cow, more amazing than shot show :))) the last shot is awesome! Give us more
Does anyone remember the awesomeness that was snow fight 3d on Miniclip? [Nostalgia] (http://www.syix.com/elmer/6-Screenshots/SnowFight003.jpg)
Lmao right in the bag at the end.
[GONE WRONG]
this is why cops shoot first and ask questions later.. never know if they are gonna trip and get ran over by a car that they walked infront of..
Is it that time of year in GTA V online again? Man I loved cruising around in the city on a snowy night. The undercarriage lights really stand out then. 

(If anybody wants to see my snow day pics from last year just ask I'll link.)
Just like club penguin
Was hoping the NPC cop would start throwing snowballs back. Like you get a star, but it's all icy looking. 1 star the cop throws snowballs at you, 2 more cops show up, 3 a riot van shows up and the water hose shoots snowballs out instead, 4 FBI joins in the fun, 5 a tank shows up and fires snowballs that knock you flat down, all the NPCs at that point bend over laughing and drive away.
What game is this? I want to play it TODAY!
Had a similar experience snowboarding once.

The weather was just in that spot where the snow was perfect for snowballs. So me and my friends went down a medium difficulty slope and had a snowball fight on the way down. We were weaving back and forth, speeding up and slowing down to avoid each other's throws. You couldn't stop, though. So as you glide you'd squat down and cup your hand, scooping up snow like an ice cream scoop. 

It was a ridiculous amount of fun....until my brother went in for the kill (close range hammer throw) missed, veered out of control and went into the trees that lined one side of the hill. There was so much powder there he got majorly stuck and had to take off his board to pull his way back onto the hill.

Amazing fun...10/10 would do again...
I honestly have lost count on how many times this .gif has been reposted AND on the frontpage of /r/all...
Hillary vs Trump #hiteminthepussy
Last throw? Underhand.....well played.
Ah yes, this gif again.
Club Penguin in a nutshell
That's fun. Is that a mod? 
Now I see why we weren't allowed to have snowball wars in school back in the day...
And one to grow on!
using snowballs you can create such terrible things. dangerous snowballs
r/unexpected
That last snowball, though.  Even threw it like a girl.
My condolences to the first cop. He will have a frostbite concussion for days, probably months
Is the snow here early?
r/unexpected
Just like Sinatra's "Let it Snow", Holiday season reposts always make me nostalgic !
do they still do this for ps3 in december?
is the holiday update out?
Is there snow in gta right now?
The way that his head got run over though! :)
the cheeky under arm bowl to the plums makes it. 
Well, that Escaladed quickly.
/r/bettereveryloop

Certifiably lit
I remember this gif from last year on Reddit 
Repost Fight
The fourth one must have hit him right in the jugular. Or it had a rock in it.
What game?
That last underhanded shot to the nuts lol well played sir
Has Christmas returned to GTA5? Anyone know if it's coming back in 2016? Console that is, I know you can have it anytime on PC with a trainer 
Tis the season to repost.
Why are most people that point out that this is a repost downvoted?
Repost #283

Well that escalated quickly.
Repost from last year for free karma? Nice job!

Watch out for that BLACK ICE, cop!!!!

Oh 
It just a prank bro. 
That dodge was cherry on top.
Gutterball
"Come on Frank, I didn't hit you that hard"
Did you legit sack tap him after he got run over?
FLAWLESS VICTORY!
Reminds me of Phil from sopranos 
Guess that snowball had ice in it...
I don't know how you die from a snowball being thrown at you.
Wow, that's a snowball fight gone horribly wrong 
Right up the cooter.
Did... did that guy just die by snowball?
that was so neat
IT'S JUST A PRANK BRO.
kick a man while he's down, bitch move.
Love the Way!Under the Car  :P 
r/instantregret
Damn this made me crack up :'D
Attempted police brutality prevented. 
Ah yes, the yearly christmas GTA V clip is here!
Is it snowing in GTA already 
"I think Squidward is taking this snowball fight really seriously."
Russian Leg Sweep. HO HO HO you activated my trap card: Stopping vehicle on head. 
When does the snow come back
I've seen this gif on this thread at least 10 times now wtf
Oh great another repost.
It's all fun and games until someone loses their head

That snowball at the end though...

Sweep the leg, Johnny!
I hope that dude has ankle insurance

Hahahahahah.. That underarm was everything! 
This feels like a hate crime
IT WAS JUST A PRANK MAN
Jebaited
...and that's why you leave the annoying people alone!
Omg I love the snow on gta it was a blast 
reposed so many times booooring
This gets reposted every week, its really annoying
I used to love the gta5 snow, then It just pissed me off after a good 20 minutes.
this is to funny
Meh
Wow, it's amazing. Every animation is really awesome.  Anyone here who can create this type of gif images?
Why'd you kill that guy? He's was clearly in mourning 
With all the snow, the red hat and the Christmas sweater - this gif always brings the Christmas spirit. 
The Christian addition of the game, includes Xmas skins and stoning of heathens!  
Is it really so bad that it's a repost? I had never seen it until today. It's hilarious too! I'm thankful for the repost gods.
For all those posting this for the election I get it. Your mad. The recount is going to be a snow ball fight. But all we  can do as a nation is elect someone better than this fuck wad. Complaining will get you nowhere. I'm all for free speech but when the team I root for is burning flags then that's where i  take my stand
Quality seems to get worse every year.
I remember this from last year. 
I love this repost!
[deleted]
I hate how reposts get the front page.
repost
GTA sucks. Down vote 
Because of the mob mentality that most of their protests or whatever you want to call them degenerate into. The fact that they seemingly went from "Hey our lives matter too!" to "kill whitey."
I never really liked these pseudo-movements that don't actually have any goals other then being a nuisance and committing property damage. Didn't like the occupy wall street folks either but at least they just contained themselves to one park instead of blocking traffic and inciting hatred
All these games seem more pointless than ever.
PS4 Pro won't be utilized properly in a while in all likelihood. The games that are now beginning their development and are targeting PS4 Pro will be the ones where there is a larger difference, i.e. games that will be released in 6-12 months or later.
> The 1.5 patch was a surprise release from Ubisoft, which claims to add 4K support on the PlayStation 4 Pro. Players on NeoGaf forums quickly dissected the results, and found inconsistent results. While the mini-map seems to run in native 4K, the game itself is a 4K upscale – which means you can still see the same pixels and visual artifacts when zooming into screenshots. [Source](https://www.vg247.com/2016/11/23/assassins-creed-syndicate-gets-a-ps4-pro-patch-with-mixed-results/)

So not a fault of the Ps4 Pro but rather the Fault of Ubisoft.

You won't blame the Fork if you can't eat soup with it wouldn't you? So stop posting such thread without first checking what is actually going on here...
No surprise there.
What? I just bought one!!
One for every block.
Hope you bought some extra hard drives on Black Friday.
Gunna need a all the clouds 
/r/softwaregore
So like 15 or 20 mins tops, right?
.. what are you hiding!
Its the same way as regular nuke.  Press up then your embark button (square for ps4)  3 times 
Did you intend to include a link or something?
I'm confused here.
The Last of Us.
The Last of Us Remastered, World of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest Builders, Uncharted 4, Infamous Second Son, and Driveclub all come to mind.  There are some games that are console exclusives but not platform exclusives too (on PC but not on Xbox), like The Witness, Final Fantasy 14, Killing Floor 2, God Eater 2, Transistor, and others.
I bought the PS4 for three games: Bloodborne, MLB: The Show and Persona 5. Still waiting on the last...
World of Final Fantasy was a great game
Last of us, infamous second son, horizon zero dawn.
Most exclusives on PS4 have been great so start with them. 
Killzone shadowfall
Uncharted collection
Uncharted 4
The last guardian(when it comes out)
Persona 5(when it comes out)

Dark souls 3 is a good time sink 
I can only really suggest JRPGs but: Disgaea 5, Atelier Sophie and Final Fantasy XV are all good to great. If you're into fighting games, King of Fighters XIV was better than expected and I've heard nothing but great things about Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator (other than the lack of people playing online). Wait and see how The Last Guardian turns out too. I plan on getting World of Final Fantasy when it goes down in price too because the demo was great.

Early next year is when things will get really interesting. Yakuza 0, Nioh, Persona 5 and Tekken 7 (which I'm pretty sure isn't exclusive). Way down the line, there's Yakuza 6 (if it gets localised), Ni No Kuni 2, Gran Turismo Sport and I heard good things about Nier on last-gen consoles so Nier: Automata will probably be one to watch out for too.

You know something else? Remember that Godzilla game everyone shat on when it came out? My brother bought that game for £6 last week and I think it's really good fun. Repetitive but fun.
Ratchet and Clank
FFXV, FFXIV, Battlefield 1, MGS5, Last of Us, Dark Souls 3 (All Souls games should be played on Playstation for sake of original control scheme and the long standing community), The Last Guardian next week, Uncharted 4, Ratchet and Clank, Doom and FF7 HD remaster (I'm an FF7 freak, so you can discount that one, but damn it really does look and play better i.e. Magic def works).
If you're a fan of Gundams and Japanese Mecha, get Super Robot Wars Moon Dwellers, SRW V, Gundam Breaker 3, SD Gundam Genesis
Uncharted, PS exclusive, solid game 
Doom, Titanfall 2, Fallout 4, Dark Souls 3
Can you simulate pissing in a water bottle and hitting a motorcyclist? If not this is not my kind of game
This game looks fun.
Not the most popular opinion I'm sure, but now that they got that out of their system, I sure hope that they bounce back with a bit more varied cast the next time.
> *platonic*

Rrrright... 
Nice! Pills!
The RP is strong with this one. And movie-script timing was awesome, what with the autocannon winding up right after he drops the line....
This looks brutal, Is it coming out for PS4?
My favorite game 😍
If this video was all of the footage of my first playthrough, it literally would be 35 seconds of the Water Temple.
Can't he just find his titan again and hop in as long as it's not destroyed?
It's seriously not "The even more incredible machine"? Sound like it is. 
Something similar like The incredible machine?
Sounds like a Rube Goldberg Machine game.  If you google it there should be a few options out there.
Might be called "ballance" by atari I guess

Because they want it to remain Playstation Exclusive. 
No one is going to sign that. 
Fuck that it should be for everyone 
Exclusives are doing a disservice to all gamers. I don't see the reasoning in supporting such practices. Console wars are stupid, in the end, it's always the user that's penalized.
Because people nowadays have it too easy, and because of it lack empathy, compassion, and decency.
If anything this tells me that PS4 owners do not want From Software to be successful.
why does it matter?  Bloodborne isn't going on PC no matter what any petition says.
When did Link become a transvestite? 
Hyrule horror picture show!
let's start raising some funds to get him some tits. #postOpLink
Is this actually using an SD card? 
First Metal Gear, now Soul Calibur... I'm watching all of my favorite IPs get bastardized into horrendous crippled creatures.
So wait no new game? 
Got a $10 used copy off Amazon, played it. Still boring, but at least it wasn't $60
...what?
The edit messed up somehow. Intended footage at 2:25.15 to 2:32.30

I can only play casually. I feel your pain. 
Loading screens?

I have just played a bit of Xcom2 Commander Ironman. accidentally activating 9 sectoids in a single turn is not fun.
I modified my mini nukes (I guess they're not really mini anymore?) to take out an area about the size of 4 Sanctuary. To prevent this from happening.
inb4 15k people complaining about the quality of a piece of software they bought before it released...
Finally...16 cores. Cant wait. Reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOO5S4vxi0o)
Dope collection
Who needs a ring when you have Musashi and Tenchu ! :O
Nice collection man
Undertale is neat if you have yet to play it.  Just ignore the fandom.

Owlboy is supposed to be great.

Always games like SMITE and HotS if you enjoy Mobas that much
My steam user is jotajade (same link). I tecommend every single game I have. Check it and see if anything atracts you :)
I know it's weird, but it kinda bothers me that Misty's portrayed as a bit of an average girl, yet 90% of the women cosplaying her are gorgeous.
Hot chick with minimal effort cosplay. To the front page! 
[Another Misty Cosplay](http://i.imgur.com/GKO5G.jpg)
Why doesn't she cosplay as the swimmers from the pokemon games? Then she could wear even less clothes. 
Nothing like shamelessly
 putting yourself on the internet to have others discuss how hot you would look without those cloths. Fun times.
I wish beyond wish I had a women who loved video games. 
Hot girl version of Ronald McDonald?

does everyone use tyson?
Too bad I'm a poor college student and can't afford it. Have fun for me OP.
This going to be in next 5 hours when I get off. I can't wait. 
I just download the music and play it in the background while I play.
I find myself on the Witcher title screen for longer than I care to admit, also I wish I could give this more than one upvote
Where is CIV 5 ?!?!?! 

TTERRAAAA NNNNNNOOOOOVVVVVVAAAAA
Every time I launch Fallout 4 I have to listen to the intro music at least once. 
I wish more games had something like the Luca theatre in FFX i used to park in there and turn the tv up while i did homework the [Besaid theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxJE6SSX-aw&app=desktop) is so calming.
I felt this way about dark souls 3
I took a stab at painting with only a palette knife in the Twitch Contest for "The Last Guardian" - I am pretty pleased with it (even if it is slightly Derpy) :P
Excellent impasto work!
I played that in a closed beta like, a year ago. It was ok.

I found it weird that I started receiving "spotlights" in my email, but when I went to play I wasn't allowed. I'll give it another go when they finally get it to open beta.
I stopped playing in closed beta when they shut down the perfectly fine x86 client in favor of a Windows Store App. The Windows Store client was either non-functional or I was the only one who actually downloaded it because I never succeeded in finding a matchmaking game from that point forward.


I think I'll wait and see if the Arc client turns out to be any good.
Sadly they don't ship anywhere else;  I'm still looking for one but I'm in the US.  So if you're in the UK or Ireland, there's an option without paying ridiculous ebay prices!
I feel like that could get annoying 
Well that's cool!

Off to storage it goes!
Obviously not real, didn't have to blow on the cartridge first before it worked.
At first my brain only recognized the duck hunt logo and I immediately got upset that he didn't have the gun controller and then got confused about the running and jumping like wait a second... this isn't duck hunt...
It's going to be fun throwing that controller across the room in a fit of rage. 
So that's what Fred Durst is doing nowadays.
The zapper must get awkward.
Doesn't really look fun
Like a beautiful woman. Looks great, too much hassle to deal with.
This looks annoying to use
I feel run and jump accuracy would be greatly effected for some reason. 
you can buy one of those that fits in your hand! Thought I'd offer some help :)
That shitty little beard ruins the whole thing for me.
So, it says "Duck Hunt"
and then its Super mario ?

Am i missing something?
Toy Story nostalgia.
It's not a good table nor a good controller... what is it, even?
Maybe throwing the controller against the wall wasnt such a good idea after all.
Looks cool in concept, but must be a pain in the ass in practice. 
That is really impractical. 
Anyone else want to see the size of the duck hunt gun?
It's cool... but entirely unpractical to play on. 
probably shouldn't of gotten past the high on drugs conception stage.
I'm happy the lead singer from the local nu-metal band has made something constructive with his life. Good for him.
Must be fake since he didn't blow the cartridge out first.
But can it run Crysis? 
That first goomba is a real bastard - glad he didn't get you there.
That doesn't seem impractical at all.
I never knew how much I needed something in my life until I saw this.
Rug and wallpaper takes me far back to dark analog age.
Btw, I once bought that same TV stand.  It comes from Walmart, it's heavy as shit, it took 3 hours to assemble with an allen wrench, and the back has NO OPENINGS for the wires to go through.  


Now show the video with the enormous gun for duck hunt. Basically you are going to atom bomb those ducks with each shot. 
"F*ck nes mini, I'm playing some table nes"
Playing your game, it glitches, and you go right back to the start.  Just like the video!
Funny seeing the tough ghetto logo in the corner with a huge nerd and his awesome geek invention. Weird mix.
Somebody needs to make these as products. And it better be under 100 bucks.
Too bad you can't actually play duck hunt. LCD + zapper = no hits ever. Doesn't work. Need a good ol' tube. 
Hard to play with it
This is literally the stupidest thing I've ever seen and I must have it.
Need.
I wish I had the kind of time
So much work and for what?
Now play Kung Fu with that giant remote, or the first double dragon. Good luck.
When Reddit's fetish for retro gaming goes too far.
Remember when these used to be unique to have?
Seems incredibly difficult to play for no reason.
This would be fun for 5 minutes
This would be awesome for single controller co-op runs.
Yeah that seems comfortable.
WOAH.....dude?! No fair, how are you possibly gonna enter the cheat code for Spy Hunter without help on ***THAT*** thing?! :(
holy shit I have the same TV
Take my money, please
this is neat but i gotta say... why the hell are these people making these elaborate NES systems that still take cartridges?  Do you want it to crash/not work constantly?

get a nice front end on an emulator for cryin out loud.
Cool for like, 2 minutes.
Wow, I really don't know what duck hunt looks like I guess.
The NES Classic looks so much smaller in photos.
Notice there are no good looking ladies around. That's all. 
I hope I can be as cool as that guy once.
Who needs an NES Mini when you've got one of these!
Why in the fuck do people lick their fucking fingers before touching stuff? Even more so just to touch a button?
Why does it say "Duck hunt" and then continues playing mario?
When did Duck Hunt become Mario?
Why would you play duck hunt without the gun controller and not sat 5mm from the screen?
Want one of those. 
That's fairly badass
Douchetastic
So stupid. 
awww man! My drink spilled again...
If he built it like the NES Advantage joystick controller, he might actually enjoy playing games on it.
Why on earth does he need to lick his finger first?
DAE Nintendo nostalgia circlejerk?!
Best not to spill your drink...
Probably fake. 
Is no one going to say anything about them starting duck hunt and then it starts playing Mario?

Edit: I don't read all the comments 
Wait, people still play this?
"Warning incoming game, warning incoming game"
That's the trippiest graphical glitch that I've ever seen. Are those individual polygons getting highlighted?
For those who care, it's a bug with SLI. Disable SLI and it runs without this issue (or change the SLI bits with Nvidia Inspector though you'll get less scaling)
Procedurally generated seizures! 

So many of you are fitting to our game! Amazing! 
Technically if it gives you a seizure and kills you, it is no man's sky again. 
Geller Field Failure! All hands prepare to repel demonic incursion!
Don't worry. Hello Games will fix it in their next update 8 months from now.
You've learned the Gek word for Fucked up!

And here I'm doing LSD.
Getting off the hate train, and trying to be constructive:

Try messing with the newly added motion blur.  it appears to be related to that since it goes away when you look around.  That may fix the issue.

EDIT: apparently it's an SLI issue not a motion blue issue.  It was just a guess, I don't even own the game.
This is no man's sky. 

This is no man's sky on drugs. 

Any questions? 
Booted it up on PS4 and didn't have any issues. Noticed the updates and am happy to say it will bring me back despite buying 5 new games on Black Friday. This is much closer to what it should have been at launch, as long as you have the right PC settings. Otherwise it works great on PS4. 
Did you win?
Have you not watched interstellar?  This is what happens when you start to get pulled into a black hole.  Fuck these haters
In Hello Games' defense, it sounded like quite a bit was added/changed in the update. It doesn't surprise me that people going back to the game are going to experience these graphical problems. I would delete the SETTINGS file and let it load in a default state first then tweak from there.
Event Horizon DLC 
At least they're trying 
*The Korvax Convergence is Upon Us*
my god, it's full of stars
When you on that LSD at 4 but have a warp gate to catch at 6.
Ze two timelines in ze space-time continuum... Zey are merging!
Looks like Lucy's sky to me. You're on a station shaped like a diamond right?
TIL I'm epileptic (and dysxelic). 
Keep thinking G-man is going to appear
Take ooooon meeeeee TAKE ON ME
At this point, I don't think it matters what they do I doubt I'll ever play it again.  It was so far removed from what was promised AND is so far removed from being even remotely entertaining that I doubt it will ever be redeemed in my eyes.
Ah yes, let's fuel the good ol' NMS circle jerk again! I think this post will be just enough...
My eyes have gone rancid....what with all them flashes.
Looks like you unlocked the acid trip mode
That would be a cool effect to use while in hyperspace or something
The epilepsy filter is coming along swimmingly 
All hail the Hypnotoad.
No Mans LSD
Ya know... I think it's better than the actual game.
Is Sony trying to give someone a stroke or something?
Jesus nsfw tag please, I'm at work.
This is what it is like to chew 5 gum.
Looks cooler than the actual game
"OH GOD I'M COMING DOWN!"
Looks like your GPU is dying.
Seems right. I played the game for an hour and a half and it crashed. Right as I was about to save.

*Twice*.
Uunnst uunnst uunnst uunnsst! Uunnst uunnst uunnst uunnsst!
I was hyped when it first came out. Got the collector's edition for PC. Then when the game was released, they said they are still in process of making it. End of the month after release, they send email saying they just got started on painting the space ship model. Hello games said they can't refund if I use the steam code. I asked if I can just get refunded the full amount minus the $60 retail price since I used the steam code. They still denied. Paypal refunded me the money in full after Hello Games didn't respond to them.
Oh no, not a graphical glitch in a video game. 

QUICK! Make a GIF and post it to Reddit so as to make it seem like the game is shit!
How many marihuanas did you inject yourself with?
Next patch is to add the audio "UHNS UHNS UHNS UHNS UHNS UHNS UHNS UHNS UHNS!"  
wayyyyy da fuck back
procedurally generated graphical glitches!
A, the hypnotoad update
They must have rolled out that 2001 Space Odyssey update
Ah well the Gellar fields failed have fun with the demons and the reality twisted hellscape that is the Warp
Accurate representation of the drugs you need to be on to enjoy Normansky.
Jazzed the place up a bit.
It's not a bug, it's a feature, 

And that didn't came from Hello Games xD
Shrooms edition!
Looks just like Hangar Module in Star Citizen when using SLI back when ot was released. 
Is the update out already ?
"Start game while updating"
The game soared to around 8k players on steam when the patch was released. Are they really going to keep supporting a game that usually has only has like 400 players on a daily basis.
Whelp, at least I can finally show people what a migraine aura looks and feels like
Procedurally generated seizure?
That's some bad trip!
I know they introduced ten new plant types, I didn't realise that some of them are hallucinogenic, damn.
Hold on while I go have a seizure real quick. 
Looks fine to me.
> Welcome to No Mans Rave! 

FTFY
"Sir, it appears we have jumped into a temporal field... Begin tripping balls now."
I got this problem as well. I could run the game at a lower resolution in fullscreen fine, before 1.1 update, now it flickers like shit unless I play in bordered. 
Yyyyyyyyyyyup
IS that hell?
Whelp they gave and are proboly gonna give a major update to the game to make people happy.
The glimpse of that UI just gave me flashbacks.
OBEY THE HYPNO-TOAD.
This is what happens when you don't collect enough procedurally generated plutonium.
Kids, this is why you don't let your PC do drugs.
/r/scenesfromahat 

*"Things you can't respond to with "I never left!""*
Acid Trip update?
procedurally generated bugs! 
Hello? God is that you?
Can you put a NSFL tag on there please? That crap almost gave me a seizure lol
Space drugs. Not even once.
If this was real life, this would be extremely scary.

For some reason I heard the Dr. Who intro...
GLITCHES RECEIVED
More like no guy buy
In all honesty Hello Games did a good job here, instead of abandoning the game they stuck with it and released an update that put in features that were promised from the beginning.
what is this party on LSD mode? 
You mean Epilepsy Sky?
Still laughing at anyone who bought this game. Good to see I can keep up the laughs. 
I'm obsessed with the Philadelphia Experiment. This gif is what I imagine the inside of the ship looked, before everyone disappeared. 
Oh shit if I can be Enzo this is game of the year
Psychedelic baby! 
Come on they fucked up the one good part of the game the visuals!!
I'm so glad I uninstalled this game!
a look into...[the Twilight Zone](https://youtu.be/XVSRm80WzZk)
Space drugs
atleast something interesting is happening. i want your version.
Where were you when the acid kicked in?
Have you tried turning it off and on again
Neat
You could encounter 2001 seizure lights, the likelihood of this. 
Possibly the most exciting thing I've seen in the game.
New and Improved!
Its cool and shit, but you still dont have multiplayer.
You know I feel like if they just reduce the price early people would buy it, wouldn't be a bad game for a Lower price tag
Looks like they've just about got all the bugs worked out!
The gift that keeps on giving, lmao
Has this game gotten better? haven't played since a week after its release.
I heard they made their first update a few days ago even though the game released months ago. Is this true??
I downloaded the updated, built my first save point, game froze/crashed when I tried to save, couldn't do control alt delete, hard restart, computer won't start now, going to best buy soon, I'm sure it's unrelated but fuck this game.  
I see you're celebrating with a space rave!
Looks like the terminator is about to warm in from the future.
Whoa. Did u take the brown acid?
Remove all mods. I got some weird graphical bug because of the 'No Rim Lighting' mod.
Thats a pretty sweet bug actually
Better!
Should not have eaten those mushrooms on that alien planet
Is Sony trying to give someone a stroke or something?
I'm glad they got the foundation done. /s
This is some pretty [major plagiarism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02k126v3Zu4) on dev's part
More like "No Man's High"? Amiright?

you should have a seizure warning on this post,
Honestly pretty pumped to head back in! I think it'll be a great first step toward becoming a really good game, NMS still for me has sooo much potential. I'm happy to support Hello games 
This game doesn't know what it wants to be.
Looks awesome!
The thing is, they weren't smart enough to lower the price sufficiently to get people to buy their game during the steam sales. The game is worth $5-10. Their marketing guys don't seem to be on this planet though.

It would have been a great success as a $5-$10 game. A lot less expectations than at the AAA price range.

It's sort of sad how much they've lost the plot. They reduced the price 30% for the steam sales, nobody cared

http://steamspy.com/app/275850
Is that a glitch?
been many months and they still havent fixed the stuttering / preformance issues on pc
10/10 Would undergo tonic-clonic seizure again.
Now comes with seizures too..
Epilepsy inbound.
Do you have epilepsy? Well you do now!
Oh look free LSD.
Welcome back marketers!
Ummm....spacial anomoly?
At first I thought this was gonna be praising the game for its update, and I was gonna call it out. But, you did it for me, OP.
welcome back to update your damn graphics drivers
That looks about right
It's a feature!
Sean Murray has a punchable face now
It's almost as if the game itself is saying "Get outtttt~"
Seizure warning tag please.
At this point, it's like they are trying to piss off gamers.
To all whom purchased this game, we've been fucking robbed. We all hold this L together. Also, fuck you and the downvotes this gets.
Thanks for posting this. Just when i was gonna give NMS another try.......
That's where I put my acid 
I had an acid trip once that was almost exactly the same as this. Intense.

Still more expensive than the drugs that would give you the same experience
so now its an acid trip.

guess i was on drugs buying it
Terrible game 
*S A V E*...*U S*...
Was the atmosphere made of LSD?
what the fuck is this garbage? everywhere I read about this shit nobody gives a fuck about this game yet it's on fucking news sites that don't even cover gaming WHAT THE FUCK??
This makes me want to cry. I had hopes they could turn it around, pull it back together...
yep, looks like a gellar field failure
This game blows 
Darude edition.
Not sure if glitch or 2001.
Well at least there's something interesting happening now 
Please, help yourself to the complimentary acid!
I am so glad they updated motion blur! I mean, look at it. It looks amazing!
The end time are here 
Could be bug. You never know with NMS.
Someone's post processing pipeline is fucked up...

Source, my post processing pipeline from my graphics assignment the other day.
Seizures man sky
Has anyone enjoyed this game???
Its a feature!
Why are people still trying to play this game
Seizure warning? 
"Yeah guys the initial product wasn't well received, so we're going to fix it."
 
*attempts to fix*

"So yeah, we broke it more" we'll call it "the strobe edition" and charge an extra 25$ as DLC". 

FACEPALM
[deleted]
or just straight up not play the game that offers less of what other (and cheaper) games offered...
> Welcome Back to No Mans Sky  
 
Nope.
I actually still have the game, and no I haven't played the new update and won't, but hope to see a decent game I can show my kids when they're born. 
Fuck anyone here who is 'it's getting better'
Fuck everyone saying 'they are adding content now'
Fuck the people who say you just need to go get a bunch of mods.
Fuck everyone who said Sean Murry didn't lie
Fuck anyone who says this is what you should expect from a game. Fuck silent devs working at a snails pace. 
Fuck cracking jokes on twitter. 

A few pieces of a game 8 months later still does not make a complete $60 game. This will never be acceptable to me. If they released everything they show in just the Steam trailer alone tomorrow, far, far after their deadline, they still deserve the hate for treating their customers like shit.

*drops mic*
So chill I had a seizure 
No mans rendering.
Dr. Who DLC amirite?
"Fixed"
wow, amazing 
'member No Mans Sky?
I love that this game bombed. It makes no sense that people spend so much money on something before they know if it's worth while or not. 
This is just the new Stargate Sequence DLC. It'll go away in about 20 minutes.
Still waiting for it to be $10 or less before I buy.
👌🏽 final nail in the coffin 
"We added new features to the game! Enjoy" - Sean Murray
Don't worry. Hello Games will fix it in their next update 8 months from now.

Is this game a bust? 
this game looks cool, what is this no man sky about?
they already got ur money... they are done now
Cringe
If Louis from Bob's burgers played Pokemon go 
Legend of Dragoon, or Mass Effect. 
Mass Effect.
every pokemon game
Bastion

*Wait...Didn't I already...Oh, nevermind.*
Planescape: Torment
Red Dead Redemption
Bioshock
Spider solitaire
honestly, minecraft. One of the things i liked about it is like discovering everything you can do in the game. Like how you just start off small trying to survive, then becoming more experienced to build extravagant structures. My friends and i put a LOT of time into that game, and are kind of experiencing the same effect in 7 Days to Die.
Command and conquer, Red Alert. Yuri's revenge!
Ultima Underworld 1 or 2
First Nier or Xenogears.    Either works for me.
Dead space - favorite horror game

Mass Effect.

Skyrim would be a close second but I forget most of that game when I replay anyway.
Torment: Planescape

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
Xenogears
Skyrim. I just can't get back into it after over 700 hours and experiencing everything :(
Grand Theft Auto IV

And Assassin's Creed 2
Fallout3
Bloodborne.
Earthbound or Chrono Trigger
Skyrim
I'd take a look at some of the other exclusives before your drop the cash. PS4 has a lot of great titles to call it's own.
Be strong mate. It is not discarded for PC yet. There is still hope! XD 
I'd just wait personally. Chances of a PC release are still pretty good, and even if it doesn't get announced soon the price of the game will have dropped so it's win/win. 
Yea, I plan on buying an Xbone for this and a few other games
So it took them a few months to release a small amount of stuff that was originally in the game in hopes people will buy their crap?
YAY! More marketing gimmicks! Thanks gabe ;)
I just took a step farther away from playing csgo.
Wasn't this a meme about half a year ago?
400$ dollars for fade with stat trak.

Oh my gosh it actually happened.
No power glove :(
How much is a glove on the market.
The skins was upsetting but.......these.........
Honestly, I think these are a good idea. 

Pity about the price on 'em but eventually it'll come down to more sane levels. Usual CS:GO skins, if it's new, bring a fat wallet.
Suckers will buy anything as long as the gameplay is solid. 
Love this game.
EDIT: SUPER**HOT** is the name.
The low FPS of the video ruined all desire to watch it.
To those who haven't played, the game is played only when you move, and this video is after he set up all his attacks in slow motion, and it is now played out in a full montage.
Headache
Good for Xbox. PS has been smug for far too long. If you ask me, Xbox has better games anyway.
well, it was like a $100 less.
That pic makes it looks like an Xbox-Boombox.
Wasn't the Xbone practically free? Lol
Don't do that, son
Please do not make jokes about Pokémon in front of children
All will be revealed in due time.
I really love this game. and They always update more fun,challenge,really awesome every version this game.I'm a warrior :)
Cool!
Everyday we get one step closer to living in SAO, and I'm alright with this (:
