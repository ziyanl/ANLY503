SMART MOVE GOOD PR AND THERES NO POINT HAVING OUTDOOR CLOTHING IF THERES NO OUTDOORS TO WEAR IT IN
YVON CHOUINARD HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STAND UP GUY
I DON'T OFTEN BUY NEW CLOTHES OR GEAR BUT WHEN I DO I LIKE TO TRY AND SUPPORT PATAGONIA IF I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY WHICH IS A BIG IF THEIR STUFF IS FAR FROM INEXPENSIVE BUT THEY MAKE QUALITY STUFF THAT WILL LAST AND THEY SEEM TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO DO IT IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY

EVEN IF YOU TAKE THE CYNICAL STANCE AND SAY IT'S ALL JUST MARKETING THAT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH COMPANIES DOING GOOD THINGS TO EARN MY BUSINESS
I HONESTLY WISH THEY WOULD HAVE STATED THIS KNEW IT AHEAD BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE EASILY BOUGHT SOMETHING FROM THEM ON BLACK FRIDAY HAD I KNOWN

EDIT LEARNED FROM THE COMMENTS IT WAS ADVERTISED AHEAD OF TIME BUT I'M NOT IN THE LOOP ENOUGH TO SEE IT DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT PATAGONIA AT ALL BUT JUST WISH TO SUPPORT MORE COMPANIES LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE ANY FURTHER INFO ON ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY COMPANIES AND WHO I SHOULD BE GIVING MY MONEY TO I'M HAPPY TO HEAR
COOL
HAVE THEY DECIDED WHERE THEY ARE DONATING IT TO

DON'T KNOW WHY HALF THE COMMENTS HERE ARE ANGRY
THAT'S THE VALUE OF AT LEAST OF THEIR JACKETS
PATAGONIA IS A BENEFIT CORPORATION SO THEY ARE ALLOWED TO USE PROFITS FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS INSTEAD OF OWNER OR SHAREHOLDER PROFITS
THAT'S SERIOUSLY AMAZING AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM IT BUT I JUST HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT THE GUY WHO WROTE THE ARTICLE IS NAMED HARRY COCKBURN
THAT'S WHY I BUY FROM THESE GUYS IT'S MORE BUT THE CLOTHES ARE MADE WELL RESPONSIBLY AND GUARANTEED
SO THEY ONLY SOLD JACKETS AND BACKPACKS THEN
ETHICAL CONSUMPTION ISN'T ENOUGH WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A GREEN ECONOMY JOIN US AT R OURPRESIDENT TO FOLLOW LEAD IN CREATING AN ECONOMY BASED ON WHAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT VALUES OF ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY
QUESTION I KNOW THEY STATE THEY ARE DONATING SALES BUT DO THEY ACTUALLY MEAN PROFIT SALES SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE TAKING A LOSS FOR EVERY ITEM SOLD MATERIAL LABOR MANUFACTURING COSTS ETC WHICH SEEMS LIKE A CRAZY MOVE

IF IT IS SALES AND NOT PROFIT CAN THEY WRITE THOSE LOSSES OFF




IS THERE A LIST OF THE CHARITIES ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPPORT

OR IS IT JUST A PART OF THE FOR THE PLANET PROGRAM WHICH MEANS IT WOULD BE THESE


SO THEY SOLD ABOUT SWEATERS
AS GREAT AS THIS IS I HOPE IT CREATES ENOUGH PUBLICITY TO MAKE UP FOR THIS LOSS CONSIDERING THAT THIS IS NOT A GOOD BUSIES MODEL THE REASON IT IS CALLED BLACK FRIDAY IS THAT THIS DAY REPRESENTS THE TIME THAT COMPANIES TYPICALLY ENTER THE BLACK FOR FINANCIALS

MAYBE OTHER COMPANIES WILL FOLLOW THE LEAD AND DONATE OF BLACK FRIDAY SALES IN THE FUTURE IF THIS WAS A THING IT WOULD LIKELY MOTIVATE MORE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE AND COULD EVEN OFFSET THE LOSS BY DOING SO
I'M NOT EVEN INTO THE WHOLE GREEN IDEA BUT THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME I LOVE THE OUTDOORS GOOD TO SEE PEOPLE HELPING OUT WITH WILDLIFE STUFF

EDIT IS THERE A LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS THEY GAVE TO AND AMOUNTS WOULD BE A SHAME IF THEY DID THIS FOR PUBLICITY LIKE SUSAN G KOHEN FUND OR WOUNDED WARRIORS FOUNDATION OR EVEN WORSE HAVE IT TO SOME HACK ORGANIZATION THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING USEFUL
WAIT THEY ONLY MAKE R OUTDOOR CLOTHES
THEY SHOULD DONATE WATERPROOF WARM CLOTHING TO THE NORTH DAKOTA PROTESTERS
WELL THEY JUST GOT MY BUSINESS FOREVER
KING


NICE PR
CHECK OUT THE GUNS ON THAT BROAD
NOT TOO HARD TO DONATE WHEN A BUTTON UP SHIRT IS
WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN BETTER JUST NOT TO MANUFACTURE THOSE CLOTHES IN THE FIRST PLACE
BILLIONAIRES GIVING MILLIONS TO BILLIONAIRES YAY
HOPEFULLY NOT TO THE ANTI NUCLEAR LUDDITES PATAGONIA OFTEN SUPPORTS
THAT'S GREAT BUT THEY DON'T MENTION WHICH ONES I'D BE WILLING TO BET THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF IT WENT TO THE BIG NAME ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THE CONSERVATION IMPACT PER DOLLAR IS FAR FAR SMALLER THAN IT IS IF DONATED TO THE SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OVERHEAD TO DEAL WITH
WHAT A NOBLE WAY TO COMMIT ECONOMIC SUICIDE
THE SITUATION IS A BIT MORE COMPLEX THAN THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS

BACK IN THE IPCC PUBLISHED THIS GRAPH OF NH ICE EXTENT

WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT THE START OF SATELLITE RECORDS WAS BACK IN AND THAT THE OFTEN CITED START OF RECORDS IN WAS STARTING AT A PEAK

GOING FURTHER BACK STUDIES SHOWED A CYCLICAL PATTERN S THROUGH TO IN FACT A PATTERN HETP THAT MARRIES VERY WELL WITH THE AMO JUST AS ARCTIC ICE CONTINUES TOO AND AS MANY PAPERS HAVE AGREED EAST G THIS ONE AND THIS ONE

WHY JUST BECAUSE AS EVER THEY LIKE TO START AT A PEAK MAKES BETTER HEADLINES

WHY JUST YEAR OLD ICE IF MANKIND HAS BEEN MELTING ARCTIC ICE FOR DECADES SHOULDN'T IT BE DECADES OLD ICE MELTING

FEEL FREE TO DOWNVOTE BUT PLEASE HAVE THE BALLS TO SAY WHY

YUP I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY OTHER PIPELINES NOT MAKING IT THROUGH AFTER THIS WHAT A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT
HE ALSO ANNOUNCED A CARBON TAX INCREASING FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION IS THE NEW GOAL SINCE IT GENERATES MORE TAX REVENUE
UGH
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE DONE IT IN FACT WE'VE CLEANED UP COMPARED TO WHAT WE DID BEFORE
SO THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO THE COAL MINES IN THE EXPECTATION OF GETTING A STEADY PENSION IN RETIREMENT WILL LIKELY GET SCREWED AGAIN COAL WORKERS MAY GET SCREWED AGAIN WITH NEW STINGIER CONTRACTS AND FEWER BENEFITS WEST VIRGINIA ECOSYSTEMS WILL GET SCREWED AGAIN AS THE STATE COMES UP SHORT ON CLEANUP COSTS AND TAXPAYERS WILL GET SCREWED AGAIN BY HAVING TO COVER THE COMPANY S OBLIGATIONS

THE EXECUTIVES HOWEVER WILL GET A FRESH START THEIR BAD BETS FORGIVEN WITH BIG SALARIES AND A STREAMLINED COMPANY

HARSH

EDIT SAVAGE

SOUNDS LIKE JAIL TIME SHOULD BE INVOLVED

BIG FAT JERKS
SHOCKING

THIS IS A BIT BUT IS THIS QUALITY OF WRITING TYPICAL OF VOX THIS WAS A ARTICLE BUT THE SLANG AND VERY CASUAL TONE ANNOYED ME THROUGHOUT
WHY IS BEHAVIOR FROM COMPANIES LIKE THIS NOT CRIMINAL
THE NIGHT BEFORE THANKSGIVING I ARRIVE AT CETI SAKOWIN THE MAIN CAMP JUST SOUTH OF BISMARCK NORTH DAKOTA ON THE STANDING ROCK RESERVATION

IT'S NOT ON THE RESERVATION IT'S ON FEDERAL LAND

WHO HAVE ARRIVED TO WINTERIZE YURTS TINY HOUSES TRAILERS BUNK HOUSES AND OTHER STRUCTURES TO GET READY FOR THE HARSH NORTH DAKOTA WINTER

WHICH THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO ON FEDERAL LAND

WHICH HAD BEN BLOCKADED BY BURNED OUT TRUCKS AND CARS SET ON FIRE BY POLICE WEEKS EARLIER

AT LEAST ONE OF WHICH WAS BURNED DOWN BY THE PROTESTERS
I'M VEGETARIAN BUT I'M WILLING TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION IF THESE FUCKERS WERE READILY AVAILABLE IN THE STORE
THIS IS A STUPID ASS ARTICLE IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT TO RECYCLE ALUMINUM STEEL AND CARDBOARD SOMETIMES PLASTIC LOSES MONEY BUT THE OTHERS MAKE UP FOR IT MY TOWN ALREADY DOESN'T DO IT FOR GLASS BECAUSE IT'S SO CHEAP TO MAKE BUT SO WHAT LAND FILLING GLASS DOESN'T CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS
HOLY SHIT DID VEGAS GROW

ALL THE RENEWABLE ACTION IS IN FINANCE SOLAR ALONE IS ALL ABOUT FINANCE WITH OUT THE FINANCING IN PLACE THE ENGINEERS WILL BE SITTING HOME WAITING FOR IT
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE BUT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC FACTORS THE AVERAGE CONSUMER FOR SO-CALLED FAST FASHION DOES NOT MAKE MUCH MONEY YET FEELS SOCIAL PRESSURE TO BE SOMEWHAT

I AM THE SAME WAY I HAVE TO ADMIT WORKING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR I DON'T MAKE MUCH MONEY AND BUY MOST OF MY CLOTHES OFF THE TARGET CLOSEOUT RACK I DO TRY TO BUY THINGS AT THE GOODWILL BUT MEN TEND TO WEAR THEIR CLOTHES DOWN TO THE NUBBIN

I WOULD LOVE TO BUY CLOTHES THAT LAST FROM ENVIRONMENTALLY REPUTABLE COMPANIES LIKE PATAGONIA BUT WHO CAN AFFORD AN FLANNEL SHIRT NOT ME

PESTICIDES FROM VEGETABLES POLYMERS FROM PLASTICS HORMONES FROM DRINKING WATER ETC ETC ETC OUR BODIES HAVE TURNED INTO MOBILE CHEMICAL TESTING LABORATORIES AND WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY CHEMICALS WE ARE GETTING IN OR WHAT THEIR EFFECTS COULD BE

EVEN THEN IT'S STILL A RISK WE ARE IN FOR A ROUGH FUTURE UNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES

BUT THE SCIENCE THE REST OF THE WORLD WE KNOW

THIS IS LITERALLY UNBELIEVABLE TO ME I SPENT YEARS STUDYING ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND OUR PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL STANCE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT A THING

I CAN'T EVEN
THANKS AMERICA
WE ALREADY HAD LITTLE HOPE OF MITIGATING THE WORST OF CLIMATE CHANGE ALREADY BUT WITH TRUMP IN OFFICE I AM CERTAIN THAT WAS THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN SOMETIMES I THINK ABOUT DYING BEFORE I SEE THE WORLD TRULY GO TO SHIT SO MY LAST MEMORIES OF MY LIFE ON EARTH ARE ONES WHERE THE PLANET WAS STILL HABITABLE
FUCKING EMBARRASSING FOR THIS COUNTRY
MARICA
I FEEL LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO BECOME AN ORGANIZATION OF LITERAL CAPTAIN PLANET VILLAINS

THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE WHAT THIS FRAUD HAS TO SAY
TRUMP JUST KILLED THE PLANET
GIVE HIM A STERN TALKING TO YEP THAT'LL WORK
I AGREE WE NEED TO PROTECT THESE AREAS FROM ANYONE WHO WOULD TRY TO DAMAGE THEM FOR PROFIT
SOLAR IS NOW CHEAPER SO THE PROFIT IS NOW IN SOLAR FARMS AND BATTERIES

GREED WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST
GREAT IDEA IN PRINCIPLE BUT A PRESIDENT CAN'T CREATE SOMETHING HE HIMSELF OR THE NEXT PRESIDENT CAN'T BREAK

I SUPPOSE HE COULD HIMSELF IF HE'S FEELING FEISTY I HEREBY DECREE THAT PRESIDENTS CAN'T ISSUE DECREES ANYMORE

IF HE ACTUALLY CARED FOR HUMANITY MORE THAN HIS OWN LIFE HE'D OFF TRUMP THE NEXT TIME HE SEES HIM
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HELPING OUT MONETARY DONATIONS CAN BE SENT TO AMERICAN RED CROSS LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS ARE REQUESTING GATORADE AND WATER BOTTLES SENT TO RAM HEADQUARTERS AT STOCK CREEK BLVD ROCKFORD TN YOU CAN CALL THEM AT TO MAKE SURE THEIR NEEDS HAVEN'T CHANGED


I DON'T SEE ANY HOPE AT ALL TO BE HONEST I'M DOING ALL I CAN TO CUT DOWN ON EMISSIONS AND I WON'T BE HAVING KIDS EITHER WHICH I THINK IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ONE CAN DO FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

I TRY TO APPRECIATE WHAT WE HAVE LEFT IT DOESN'T DO MUCH BUT IT WAS PRETTY CATHARTIC TO PUT UP NESTBOXES FOR BIRDS IN A NEARBY RURAL PARK LAST SPRING AND RIP OUT THE OCCASIONAL INVASIVE PLANT I SEE ON MY WALKS I'M THINKING ABOUT PLANTING A FEW TREES NEXT SPRING AS WELL AND STARTING A VEGETABLE GARDEN TOO IF THERE ENDS UP BEING WIDESPREAD CROP FAILURE I WILL AT LEAST BE SOMEWHAT PREPARED FOR IT

ALSO CONTACT YOUR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE THEY MIGHT NOT LISTEN BUT IT'S STILL WORTH A TRY
I JUST DONATED TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL THEY HAVE A GREAT CHARITY NAVIGATOR RATING AND IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE LEGAL ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE SUCH A MASSIVE PART OF MITIGATING THE DAMAGE THAT'S TO COME IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE IS MATCHING DONATIONS MADE TO THEM TODAY TOO
I HAVE NO IDEA WHICH CHARITIES WILL HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT OUT THERE BUT TODAY I PLAN TO DONATE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND AND THE NATURE CONSERVANCY OF CANADA THEY WERE BOTH RANKED TOP ON CHARITY NAVIGATOR AND CHARITY INTELLIGENCE RESPECTIVELY AND BEING AN AVID BIRDER I MAY ALSO DONATE TO THE AUDUBON SOCIETY AS WELL
GREAT QUESTION PERHAPS SOMEONE CAN PROVIDE US WITH A LIST OR SEVERAL WITH ONE OR TWO SUGGESTIONS
PRESCRIBED BURNING HAS ALWAYS BEEN CRITICIZED DUE TO THE RISK OF THESE FIRES GETTING OUT OF CONTROL
I ACTUALLY THINK TRUMP WOULD LISTEN TO THE POPE ON THIS ISSUE

I SURE HOPE SO ANYWAY HE SEEMS TO SHARE THE SAME DISTRUST IN SCIENCE AS SO MANY CONSERVATIVES BUT MAYBE HE'LL LISTEN TO POPE FRANK
I AM NOT RELIGIOUS BUT I REALLY RESPECT AND APPRECIATE WHAT THE POPE IS SAYING ABOUT LISTENING TO SCIENCE

KIND OF FUNNY THAT THE POPE IS TRYING TO CONVINCE DONALD TRUMP TO BELIEVE SCIENTISTS THOUGH WHAT A WORLD
A MASSIVE CAMPAIGN OF ANGRY PHONE CALLS AND INDIGNANT EMAILS TO DEPARTMENTS PLANNING TO TRAVEL TO NORTH DAKOTA SUCCEEDED IN PERSUADING MULTIPLE SHERIFFS ELECTED OFFICIALS THE BRUTAL TACTICS USED AGAINST PEACEFUL STANDING ROCK SIOUX AND OTHER WATER PROTECTORS HAVE BEEN A GROSS ABUSE OF POWER

WRITING TO YOUR LOCAL OFFICIALS WORKS GUYS DO IT
DALLAS THAT'S AMAZING
AM I MISSING SOMETHING ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE APPLAUDING THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE CUTTING DOWN FORESTS TO BUILD GOLF COURSES AND HORSE ARENAS IF WE PUT A NATURE CENTER THERE NO ONE WILL NOTICE THE MISSING ACRES OF FOREST AND REMOVING TREES MITIGATES FLOODING HOW

BIGGEST PARK SOUNDS GREAT IF YOU'RE REPLACING FORMER INDUSTRIAL SITES NOT SO MUCH IF YOU'RE REPLACING NATURAL WOODLANDS
DID THEY NOT INCLUDE REDDIN POSTERS IN THIS STUDY WE BEATEN GERMANY BY A MILE
BUT HOW WILL WATER PROTECTORS BE PIGEON HOLED AS DIRTY HIPPIES GREEDY INDIANS IF THEY ARE ALSO MILITARY HEROES AN EPIC COLLISION OF NARRATIVES IS ABOUT TO OCCUR
THE AMOUNT IN QUESTION IS CERTAINLY NOT ALL OF WATER YOU WEAKEN YOUR CASE WHEN YOU PUT A FALSEHOOD IN YOUR HEADLINE
STOP BUYING BOTTLED WATER OR AT LEAST GO FOR MUNICIPAL SOURCE
SO NESTLE TAKES FRESH WATER FROM MICHIGAN BOTTLES IT THEN SELLS IT TO THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE TO RESIDENTS OF FLINT UNTIL THEY CAN FIGURE OUT A LONG-TERM SOLUTION NOTHING SHADY GOING ON HERE FOLKS MOVE ALONG
THESE TITLES ARE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE THE COMPANY IS SNEAKING AROUND IN THE DARK SYPHONING WATER AND THEN SCAMPERING AWAY THIS ISN'T WHAT'S HAPPENING AT ALL

NESTLE ISN'T STEALING WATER THE STATE OF MICHIGAN IS GIVING IT AWAY TO THEM
I AM GENUINELY CONFUSED ABOUT YOUR HEADLINE AFTER READING THROUGH THE ARTICLE TWICE NOWHERE IN THE ARTICLE IS THE APL OR THE PROTESTS MENTIONED BOTH OF THESE ARE IMPORTANT BUT IN NO WAY IS NESTLE HIDING OR USING NODAL AS A COVER THEY'RE USING THE SAME SHITTY COVERAGE OF LOCAL NEWS FOR LAND USE AND CORRUPT POLITICIANS THAT THEY DID FOR CASCADE LOCKS IN OREGON BOTH STORIES APL AND NESTLE NEED MORE COVERAGE
IS THERE ANY HARD SCIENCE ABOUT HOW THIS CHANGE IS HARMFUL OR IS IT JUST SOME GUY SAYING SEEMS LIKE TOO MUCH
JUST DON'T BUY IT
THEY ARE STEALING WATER FROM ABERFOYLE ONTARIO TOO THEY PAY NEXT TO NOTHING AND BASICALLY SUCK THE AQUIFER DRY
WOULDN'T YOU DO IT TOO THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS NOT NESTLE BUT THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWS NESTLE TO DO THIS I HAVE A HARD TIME GOING AFTER COMPANIES WHEN IT IS THE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL WHO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN THEY ARE THE ONE'S ALLOWING THESE COMPANIES TO TAKE THE WATER THE FIGHT IS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT NOT NESTLE THE BIG CORPORATIONS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO LOOK AT THEIR PROFIT MARGINS AND FIGURE OUT HOW THEY CAN MAKE MORE IT'S THE GOVERNMENTS JOB TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE NOT THESE BUSINESSES
IF YOU WANT CHANGE SPEAK UP AND CONTACT YOUR LOCAL CONGRESSMAN OR WOMEN
OME AN EVIL CORPORATION IS DOING THINGS

YOU FORGOT YOUR TINFOIL HAT
NESTLE IS LIKE EMPEROR PALATINE IT RELISHES IN ITS EVIL
ALL THE LEAD TOO
HAHA ON NESTLE MI WATER IS FULL OF LEAD
THIS KIND OF RIFTING BEHAVIOR PROVIDES ANOTHER MECHANISM FOR RAPID RETREAT OF THESE GLACIERS ADDING TO THE PROBABILITY THAT WE MAY SEE SIGNIFICANT COLLAPSE OF WEST ANTARCTICA IN OUR LIFETIMES

YEARS FROM THE BIRTH OF AGRICULTURE TO RENDERING LARGE PARTS OF DRY LAND UNINHABITABLE OR NOT ARABLE OH WELL HOMO SAPIENS HAD A GOOD RUN I GUESS
EVERY MONTH OR SO THEY DISCOVER ANOTHER WAY THAT THE ICE SHEETS ARE CHANGING IN A MORE RAPID MANNER MELTING ON TOP MELTING BELOW ADD ON SOME BLACK POLLUTANT TO INCREASE THAT AND MAKE IT FLOAT AWAY GOOD JOB HUMANITY
IF THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT IS MAGNIFIED IN HIGH LATITUDES AS NOW SEEMS LIKELY DEGLACIATION OF WEST ANTARCTICA WOULD PROBABLY BE THE FIRST DISASTROUS RESULT OF CONTINUED FOSSIL FUEL CONSUMPTION A DISQUIETING THOUGHT IS THAT IF THE PRESENT HIGHLY SIMPLIFIED CLIMATIC MODELS ARE EVEN APPROXIMATELY CORRECT THIS DEGLACIATION MAY BE PART OF THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID IN ORDER TO BUY ENOUGH TIME FOR INDUSTRIAL CIVILISATION TO MAKE THE CHANGEOVER FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO OTHER SOURCES OF ENERGY IF SO MAJOR DISLOCATIONS IN COASTAL CITIES AND SUBMERGENCE OF LOW-LYING AREAS SUCH AS MUCH OF FLORIDA AND THE NETHERLANDS LIES AHEAD MORE SOPHISTICATED CLIMATIC MODELLING MAY SHOW THAT THE OUTLOOK IS LESS ALARMING THAN THIS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT MAY SHOW THAT THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE THREATENING

THE ARTICLE SAYS

CONSERVATIONISTS IN SCOTLAND ARE WATCHING THE MARCH OF THE GREY SQUIRREL NORTHWARD WITH CONSIDERABLE ALARM THEY BELIEVE THE RED SQUIRREL INDIGENOUS TO THE BRITISH ISLES COULD BE COMPLETELY WIPED OUT IN A GENERATION AND THEY ARE BLAMING THE GREY SQUIRREL WHICH WAS INTRODUCED FROM NORTH AMERICA IN THE LATE CENTURY
THE FISH WERE DEAD TO BEGIN WITH YOU CAN'T FREEZE LIVE FISH IN PLACE AND HAVE THEM STAY IN PERFECTLY FORMED SCHOOLS LET ALONE THE WORDS HELLO
AS TERRIBLE AS SOME THINK THIS IS I FEEL LIKE MOST WILL IGNORE THE RESOURCES THAT WILL NOW BE WASTED IN DRAINING AND REFILLING THIS RINK I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY WORSE THAN THE OUTRAGE OVER SOME FISH THAT THEY CLAIM WERE ALREADY DEAD THE REMEDY IS GOING TO BE MORE DAMAGING THAN HE INITIAL THING
THOUSANDS OF ALREADY DEAD FISH
THE JAPANESE ARE ANGERED AT THIS AND YET THEY ARE ALRIGHT WITH WHALING WEIRD
NOT NECESSARILY THAT IMMORAL CONSIDERING THE FISHING INDUSTRY BUT JUST WEIRD GROSS AND IN POOR TASTE
REALLY A COOL IDEA AND WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE BEAUTIFUL IF THEY WOULD HAVE JUST USED FAKE FISH OR PICTURES UNDER THE ICE LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DID FOR THE RAYS IN THE SECOND PICTURE
PEOPLE GET UPSET OVER THE WEIRDEST SHIT
FUCKING JAP SCUMBAGS AGAIN MUST BE THE SAME CREWS THAT NEEDLESSLY HUNT WHALES AT LEAST SOME OF THEIR OWN ARE REBELLING AGAINST THESE ATROCIOUS ACTS THOUGH
A LINK TO THE REPORT REFERENCED IN THE NEWS ARTICLE
THIS NEEDS MORE ATTENTION
THIS IS ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE IN DEPTH RESEARCH DONE BY PAULINE HANSON SHE HAS THE BEST INCREST OF THE REEF IN MIND
OME THE GREAT BARRIER REEF DIDN'T DIE
THERE'S A HUGE SOLAR FARM BEING BUILT JUST OUTSIDE OF FLINT BY ONE OF ELECTRIC COMPANIES I THINK INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES ARE WANTING TO MOVE TOWARDS CHEAPER RENEWABLE ENERGIES BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE FUTURE IS HEADED
HEY THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM THE FIRST GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL THING THAT'S HAPPENED AROUND HERE IN A WHILE UNFORTUNATELY
I LIKE TO IMAGINE IF THESE COMPANIES WERE GUESTS AT YOUR FAMILY DINNER UNCLE NESTLE AND COUSIN COCA COLA COME AROUND AND THEY ALWAYS LEAVE A HUGE MESS SO MOMMA NATIONAL PARK SERVICE SAYS HEY NO MORE PLASTIC BOTTLES AT DINNER SO INSTEAD OF JUST LISTENING TO MOMMA NS UNCLE NESTLE AND COUSIN COCA COLA GO TO DADDY SUPREME COURT AND SAY HEY WE HAVE A RIGHT TO BRING THESE BOTTLES WE ARE MAKING MONEY FROM THESE BOTTLES IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT MOMMA NS HAS TO CLEAN THEM UP THAT'S HER JOB ANYWAYS
WATER IS A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE WE NEED MORE BOTTLE FILLING STATIONS EVERYWHERE DON'T BUY ANYTHING NESTLE
MORE THAN PLASTIC ITSELF THE PROBLEM IS IN THE PEOPLE HOW HARD IS IT TO BRING AN EMPTY BOTTLE HOME AND THROW IT IN THE RECYCLE BIN
HOW HARD IS IT FOR COCA COLA NESTLE TO MAKE SOME LONG-LASTING REFILLABLE CANTEENS AND SELL THEM AT PARKS FOR A PROFITABLE MARGIN
WATCH V
IS THERE A REASON THAT THIS IS TARGETING BOTTLED WATER ONLY AND NOT SODAS SPORTS DRINKS IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH SOMEBODY BUYING A PLASTIC BOTTLE OF WATER THEN REFILLING IT A FEW TIMES THEN THROWING IT INTO THE RECYCLING BIN I GUESS I'M JUST CONFUSED AS TO WHY THE HEALTHIEST BEVERAGE OPTION IS BEING SINGLED OUT WHILE THE OTHERS ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE BEING SOLD DESPITE THE LOWER PROBABILITY OF A BOTTLE OF COKE GETTING REFILLED VERSUS A SASANI

ALSO IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT PLASTIC BOTTLES OF WATER ARE ACTUALLY A HUGE PART OF THE WASTE LITTERING AMERICA'S NATIONAL PARKS NOT DOUBTING IT JUST WANTING TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY ACTUAL EVIDENCE OR IT'S PURELY ANECDOTAL

COULD THIS WHOLE PROBLEM BE SOLVED IF ONLY PREBILLED BOTTLES OF WATER WERE SOLD AT THE PARKS OR MAYBE SOME RECEPTACLE IN THE VENDING MACHINE TO SCAN RECYCLE THE BOTTLE TO GET A DISCOUNT ON ANOTHER
EVEN IF YOU MIGHT NOT BE CANADIAN THIS SITE SEEMS TO HAVE THE INFO YOU WANT

SOMETIMES CITIES WILL OFFER SAPLINGS AT A REDUCED PRICE TO HELP IMPROVE URBAN TREE COVER SO YOU COULD LOOK INTO THAT TOO
AND BY MANAGED THEY MEAN SHOOT EVERY WOLF IN SIGHT UNTIL THERE ISN'T ANY LEFT
I LIVE IN THIS AREA UPPER PENINSULA OF MICHIGAN ACTUALLY AND A CERTAIN LARGE SEGMENT OF PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NUTS ABOUT WOLVES I LIVE HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS AND I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN A WOLF IN THE WILD IN MY LIFE COYOTES YES WOLF NUMBER

YET EVERY DAY PEOPLE TELL YOU THESE INSANE BS STORIES ABOUT HOW A WOLF KILLED THEIR DOG THEIR COW ATTACKED THEIR CHILDREN LOL IT'S ABSOLUTE HYSTERIA LIKE YOU CAN'T STEP FOOT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE WITHOUT A VICIOUS WOLF PACK SURROUNDING YOU ALL BECAUSE THEY DESPERATELY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT SEARCHING FOR ONE TO SHOOT

PEOPLE ARE NUTS
IF YOU GOT MONEY BUY AN ELECTRIC CAR OR PLUG IN HYBRID ADVANCING THE TECHNOLOGY PROBABLY DOES MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE OIL YOU WON'T USE CONSIDER GETTING SOLAR PANELS AS WELL
THEY ARE GETTING PUMMELED EVERY DAY BY FREEZING COLD WATER MACE AND RUBBER BULLETS WHAT WAS THE ACCE THINKING THEY WILL HAVE MORE LUCK MAKING THE OTHER GUYS GO AWAY BUT NO THAT'S NOT HOW CAPITALISM WORKS FUCK THE LITTLE GUYS RIGHT
HEROES

GOOD STAND YOUR GOWN AND DON'T LET BIG OIL WALK ALL OVER YOU
REPUBLICAN SEN JOHN HOEVE ALSO URGED PROTESTERS TO RESPECT THE LAW AND PEACEFULLY LEAVE THE PROTEST AREA

THE WELL-BEING AND PROPERTY OF RANCHERS FARMERS AND EVERYONE ELSE LIVING IN THE REGION SHOULD NOT BE THREATENED BY PROTESTERS WHO ARE WILLING TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE HE SAID IN A STATEMENT

MEANWHILE A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS HELD A RALLY TO BACK THE BLUE ON SATURDAY

BISMARCK POLICE ARRESTED MORE THAN PEOPLE AT A MALL FRIDAY FOR ALLEGED CRIMINAL TRESPASSING INVOLVING THE PROTESTERS ABOUT PROTESTERS HAD GATHERED TO GENERATE A PRAYER CIRCLE WHICH POLICE SAID DISRUPTED BLACK FRIDAY SHOPPING

FUCK THESE PEOPLE
I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS ENDING WELL FOR THE PROTESTORS
WHERE IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ON THIS ISSUE BERNIE IS ONLY ONE IN HIGHER PUBLIC OFFICE WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS WHO SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT THE PIPELINE AND THE PROTESTORS

THERE'S ONLY ONE THING LEFT FOR US TO DO CONTINUE ORGANIZING JOIN US AT R OURPRESIDENT TO FOLLOW LEAD IN TAKING OVER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND MAKE THEM ADOPT A MORE AGENDA
SOMEONE SHOULD CALL UP PLANT LADY JILL STEIN
THE FREE SPEECH ZONE THE ARMY CORPS HAS PROPOSED SOUTH OF THE CANNONBALL RIVER IS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN ACRES AND PROVIDES CLEARER JURISDICTION FOR POLICE FIRE AND MEDICAL UNITS

FREE SPEECH ZONE

WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK
UNPERMITTED PROTEST ACTIVITIES FUCK YOU
DELETED
I'D LOVE TO SEE THE ARMY TRY TO KICK OUT VETS THAT SHOULD GO OVER WELL

JUST MOVE THE PIPELINE
THE WELL-BEING AND PROPERTY OF RANCHERS FARMERS AND EVERYONE ELSE LIVING IN THE REGION SHOULD NOT BE THREATENED BY PROTESTERS WHO ARE WILLING TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE REPUBLICAN SEN JOHN HOEVE

WHETHER THEY ARE WILLING TO BE VIOLENT IS IMMATERIAL SINCE THEY HAVEN'T YET ACTUALLY DONE SO THE POLICE AND THE MERC SECURITY FORCE ON THE OTHER HAND HAS BEEN QUITE VIOLENT I THINK IN THE NAME OF PUBLIC SAFETY WE SHOULD GET THOSE LATTER GROUPS OFF OF THE LAND
WHAT IF PEOPLE WENT THERE
THE ACCE WANTED THEM TO LEAVE THE NORTHERN CAMP BECAUSE ONCE WINTER SETS IN THEY WILL BE TRAPPED THERE AND THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF THEM BEING RESCUED THEY WANT THEM TO MOVE TO THE SOUTHERN CAMP
WHY NOT PROTEST THE PIPELINES ALREADY ON THIS LAND THEY DONT OWN

OHHHH THATS RIGHT THEY RENEGED ON THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY AGREED TO TAKE AND NOW WANT MORE

GREEDY
FUCK THESE SO CALLED PROTESTORS AND GUCK THE MEDIA FOR KEEPING COVERAGE OF IT
DO YOU WANT TO GET THE HOSE AGAIN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE HOSE AGAIN
NO WHITE PEOPLE NO STORY
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH FOOTBALL OR DONALD TRUMP
TRUMP NEEDS TO EMBRACE

I AM NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER BUT GOOD GRIEF DOES ANYONE REALLY THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO EMBRACE ANYTHING HEADLINES LIKE THESE MAKE ME THINK THE WHOLE POINT OF THE ARTICLE IS TO SELL ADVERTISING

NOT INTENDED AS A BASH OF THE POSTER
THIS COMES ACROSS TO ME AS A PUFF PIECE LET'S ASK EVERYBODY HOW TO FIND HOPE TO ME THIS APPROACH MINIMIZES WHAT'S HAPPENING LIKE A FORM OF DENIAL LET'S JUST TURN OUR ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE TSUNAMI AND GRASP ANY FLOATING STRAWS OF HOPE
NOT BUYING DAIRY AT ALL
ACTIVELY DENYING IT EXISTS
ABOUT TIME HOPEFULLY THEY'LL STOP BURNING THINGS AND LEAVE I'M BETTING THEY WON'T AND THE NATIONAL FAURD WILL HAVE TO BE CALLED IN CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM GET MAXED AND SENT AWAY WITH
I ASSUME YOU MEAN HEAT PUMP THE HEAT PUMP IS MORE EFFICIENT DOWN TO AROUND GIVE OR TAKE SOME DEPENDING ON THE AGE OF THE HEAT PUMP THE REASON IS A HEAT PUMP MOVES HEAT FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER AS OPPOSED TO SPACE HEATERS WHICH MUST CREATE HEAT BY ELECTRIC RESISTANCE
FOR AN ISLAND FOSSIL FUELS MUST BE DELIVERED SO SOLAR POWER IS MORE ECONOMICAL ESPECIALLY NEAR THE EQUATOR

TUTUILA HAS SUBSIDIZED TA U DIESEL SHIPMENTS FOR DECADES TO THE TUNE OF US A YEAR

THE QUESTION IS HOW TO STORE POWER AT NIGHT THE HEADLINE FAILED TO MENTION TESLA BATTERIES WHICH ARE KEY
NO ITS JUST ANOTHER PIPELINE IN THE LARGER INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS ONE BESIDES THAT IT'S THE CONFLUENCE OF PUBLIC ATTENTION LACK OF CONSENT FROM INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AS YOU NOTED THERE'S ALREADY A PIPELINE CROSSING THE RIVER WHERE APL WILL CROSS THERE'S NOTHING PARTICULAR SAYING THAT HIS PIPELINE WILL BREAK UNDER THE RIVER MORE THAN ANY OTHER PIPELINE IF IT WERE TO BREAK DIRECTLY UNDER THE RIVER OR IN AN AREA ADJACENT IT WOULD CERTAINLY POLLUTE THE RIVER AND BE WASHED DOWNSTREAM UNTIL IT'S TURNED OFFICIAL AS THIS IS A BURIED PIPELINE THE RISK IS VERY LOW BUT STILL THE RESULT WOULD PROBABLY KILL OFF ANYTHING LIVING OFF THE WATERS OR IN THE WATERS

IMO FEAR OF THIS PIPELINE BURSTING MIGHT BE THE STEM REASON PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING BUT THE LACK OF CONSENT FROM THE TRIBES AND INCREASED MILITARIZATION OF POLICE IN RESPONSE TO PROTESTS ARE WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE NATIVE PEOPLE HERE HAVE NO LEGAL RECOURSE AGAINST INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT THAT'S PERMITTED AND APPROVED BY STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROTESTING IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET THEIR VOICE HEARD EVEN SO THE PIPELINE IS PROBABLY GOING TO GET BUILT IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT VOTE CHANGE THE LAWS CHANGE THE REGULATIONS I DON'T THINK THE PROTEST WILL STOP CONSTRUCTION BUT IT CAN PLAY A PART IN DRAWING PUBLIC ATTENTION
THOSE THAT CAN WILL BUY IT FROM NESTLE
WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THE PROTESTERS AT STANDING ROCK I SEE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CAMPS LISTED AS PART OF THE PROTEST SACRED STONE CAMP CETI SAKOWIN RED WARRIOR ROSEBUD DO I DONATE TO EACH INDIVIDUALLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE SIOUX TRIBAL COUNCIL HAS ASKED THE RED WARRIOR CAMP TO STAND DOWN IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE FOLKS IN NORTH DAKOTA
HE'LL REPLACE THE PLANET WITH SOMETHING AMAZING
THE PROBLEM IS MUCH LARGER AND MORE COMPLEX THAN TRUMP HOPEFULLY FOCUSING ON TRUMP WON'T CAUSE US TO LOSE FOCUS ON INDUSTRIES UTILITIES LIFESTYLE POPULATION GROWTH AND OTHER CLIMATE DAMAGING FACTORS

GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT BY BEING A LIGHTING ROD HE PROVIDES COVER FOR OTHER CLIMATE DAMAGING SOURCES
I KEEP TELLING PEOPLE THIS DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE OCEAN RISES RIGHT NOW THAT IS A LONG TERM PROBLEM THAT CAN BE HANDLED REASONABLY WELL THE FOOD AND WATER SUPPLY WILL BE THE BIG HITTER LONG BEFORE THE SEA FRONT HOMES FALL INTO THE OCEAN
THIS DOESN'T LINK TO THE ARTICLE
WORKING LINK AMP NEWS WORLD
AND IGNORE THE APL PROTESTS
THANKS FOR THE WRITE UP AND FOR GOING OUT AND DOING SOMETHING THERE'S CERTAINLY MORE THAN JUST THE PEOPLE AT STANDING ROCK THAT APPRECIATE IT AS A FELLOW LOVER OF THE PLANET THOUGH I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT YOUR OWN FIREWOOD I WALKED ACROSS COLORADO THIS SUMMER AND YOU GUYS HAVE AN ASIAN WOOD BORING BEETLE EPIDEMIC HALF THE FORESTS IN COLORADO ARE DYING TRANSPORTING FIREWOOD ACROSS LARGE LAND MASSES IS WHAT CONTRIBUTES TO THEIR SPREAD NOT TRYING TO BUT I FEEL IT'S WORTH MENTIONING IF ANY ONE ELSE IS CONSIDERING GOING OUT THERE TO BRING SUPPLIES AND HELP PLEASE LEAVE YOUR LOCAL FIREWOOD AT HOME
PROMISE THEM DEATH

OH CMON QUIT BEING SO DRAMATIC ALSO THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS VS THE ARMED FORCES ONE IS A BUNCH OF NERDS AND BUREAUCRATS CHARGED WITH NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATION AND THE OTHER IS A BUNCH OF JACKED DUDES WITH GUNS THE FORMER IS THE ONE ISSUING LEGAL ACTION
THE FUCK IS AN EMPATH
I AM IN COMPLETE SUPPORT OF THE STANDING ROCK PROTEST HOWEVER THREE THINGS I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HERE ONE EMPATH MAKES YOU LOSE CREDIBILITY TWO TELLING PEOPLE TO COMPLETELY DISREGARD EVERY PERSON'S VERSION OF EVENTS EXCEPT FOR THE NATIVE AMERICAN'S IS NOT WHAT WE NEED WE NEED FACTUAL UNBIASED REPORTING THREE THE DETAILS OF THE ARMY'S LETTER IS NOT THEM PROMISING DEATH I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE HERE BUT I DISREGARD POSTS LIKE THESE BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO ONE-SIDED
YEAH LABELING YOURSELF AS AN EMPATH DOES NOT EXACTLY COMMAND CREDIBILITY GREAT WRITEUP THOUGH THANKS FOR POSTING OP
AS A PSYCHIC I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE 5TH
PEOPLE HAD BEEN ARRESTED ATTEMPTING TO STAND IN THE OIL PIPELINE S WAY FREELANCE REPORTERS DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKERS PRODUCERS OF MEDIA AND INDEPENDENT ACTIVISTS ARMED WITH A CELL PHONE HAVE ALL BEEN SWEPT UP IN MASS ARRESTS THAT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT ALMOST WEEKLY SINCE OCTOBER

THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THEY WERE TARGETED
MAKES SENSE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT
BASICALLY BECAUSE IT RESULTS IN A REDUCTION OF GROUND WATER AND WATER AVAILABLE FOR OTHER USES

WHILE WATER IS CERTAINLY ABUNDANT ON EARTH IT IS NOT EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED AND MUCH OF IT IS CLEAN FRESH WATER IS RELATIVELY RARE

THE NORMAL HYDROLOGIC CYCLE IS THAT WATER FALLS TO THE GROUND AND SLOWLY MIGRATES THROUGH THE SOIL THROUGH MANY ROUTES IT CAN BE SUCKED UP IN VEGETATION AND EVENTUALLY TRANSPIRED BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE IT MAY PENETRATE DEEPLY AND HELD FOR YEARS IN UNDERGROUND RESERVOIRS IT CAN RUNOFF AS SURFACE WATER DIRECTLY INTO STREAMS LAKES RIVERS ETC

HOWEVER WATER THAT ENTERS THE WATER SUPPLY IS TO THE OCEAN IT'S HELD UP IN A RESERVOIR SENT IN PIPES TO A TREATMENT PLANT THEN PUMPED INTO THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK IT'S USED AND THEN SENT DOWN THE SEWER TO A SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT AND THEN DISCHARGED IF NOT DIRECTLY INTO THE OCEAN INTO SOME BODY OF WATER THAT WILL LEAD THERE

THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THESE VAST QUANTITIES OF WATER THAT ARE USED TO PRODUCE WHATEVER WOULD BE BETTER USED FOR INSTANCE AS IRRIGATION WATER DRINKING WATER ETC
BECAUSE THE CORPORATE MASTERS KNOW THAT IF THE PUBLIC IS INFORMED ON THIS MOST PEOPLE WILL SIDE WITH NATIVE AMERICANS AND BE AGAINST BLATANT OIL GREED

THIS IS ONE OF THE RARE INSTANCES WHERE THE MSM IGNORES IT'S BIAS FOR SENSATIONALISM IN FAVOR OF CENSORSHIP BY OMISSION BECAUSE COVERING THE PROTEST PROPERLY COULD COME BACK TO BITE THEIR PROFITS IN THE ASS
THE MSM REALLY DOESN'T SEEM TO THINK LARGE GATHERING OF PISSED OFF PEOPLE IS NOTABLE NEWS UNLESS THEY HAPPENED TO BE PISSED OFF ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES MONEY
PIPELINE BREAKS ARE IN NO WAY UNUSUAL

WIKI

I KNOW THIS ISN'T ENTIRELY RELEVANT AND I'M PREACHING TO THE CHOIR BUT I'VE DECIDED TO POST THIS IN ALL ALP RELATED POSTS I COME ACROSS
THEY'VE BEEN CRIMINALLY UNDER COVERED AND OUR REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN TOO QUIET WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS BERNIE IS THE ONLY STRONG ADVOCATE AGAINST THE PIPELINE AND IN SUPPORT OF THE PROTESTORS

JOIN US AT R OURPRESIDENT TO FOLLOW LEAD IN DOING THE RIGHT THING AT THIS IMPORTANT MOMENT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE OVER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU ALL HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR DISCUSSION ON THIS AS A NORTH DAKOTAN ALL I HEAR IS BLUE LIVES MATTER AND IT'S SO FRUSTRATING OMAHA KANSAS CITY STREET LOUIS MEMPHIS NEW ORLEANS YOU'RE ALL DOWNSTREAM OF THIS THAT'S DRINKING WATER FOR MILLIONS NOT JUST THOSE LIVING ON STANDING RAF

TO HEAR THE GOVERNOR SPOUT HIS LIES AND MISINFORMATION TO READ THE COMPLETELY CRAP FROM THE SHERIFF THIS ISN'T AMERICA JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING ATTORNEY GENERAL WAYNE STENEHJEM APPROVED THE SALE OF ACRES OF CANNON BALL RANCH TO DAKOTA ENERGY PARTNERS EARLY IN NORTH DAKOTANS OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED AGAINST MEASURE THAT WOULD ALLOW CORPORATIONS TO OWN AGRICULTURAL LAND

NORTH DAKOTANS SPECIFICALLY FORBADE CORPORATIONS FROM OWNING AG LAND YET THE ATTY GENERAL WENT RIGHT ON BEHIND THEIR BACKS AND SAID THIS SALE WAS LEGIT BECAUSE IT EASES ACCESS TO APL DRILLING SITES

WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN'T EVEN FOLLOW THE LAW WHAT'S THE POINT OF LAWS

IN ALL FAIRNESS THEY DID CRIMINALESE COVERING IT BY PROSECUTING JOURNALISTS SO IT SHOULDNT BE SURPRISING
A SAD WORLD WE LIVE IN FOLKS
ANUNAKI
IT WILL BE NICE TO HAVE MEDIA MATTERS DOING SOMETHING MORE USEFUL AGAIN THAN PLAYING DEFENSE FOR MISSTEPS
THEY JUST DON'T GET IT THIS IS A BIG PART OF THE REASON WHY THE DEMOCRATS LOST SO BAD THIS ELECTION CYCLE THEY AND THE MSM ARE SO DISCONNECTED WITH THE PEOPLE YET THEY KEEP TRYING TO SHOVE THIS NARRATIVE ON US AT ALL COSTS INSTEAD OF REPORTING OBJECTIVELY
IT IS UNDERREPORTED EXCEPT WHEN IT CAN PUT A BAD LIGHT ON TRUMP LIKE HIS INVESTMENT IN THE PIPELINE IF THEY COVERED IT MORE THOROUGHLY IT WOULD PUT A BAD LIGHT ON AT LEAST OBAMA AND SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS
WHAT ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS DOES IT POSE THAT ARE NOT ALREADY PRESENT
MINUTE RANT ON MSM COVERAGE OF STANDING ROCK APL

WATCH JORDAN GOES OFF ON FALSE STANDING ROCK COVERAGE ON YOUTUBE
SO WAS BERNIE YOU WANTED A GREEN PLANET SHOULD HAVE HAD AN ARTICLE BACK IN MAY ABOUT HOW BERNIE WAS CRIMINALLY UNDERCOVERED AND THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN'T HAVE AN POTUS MSBC ALWAYS SPINNING THE TRUTH AND A DAY LATE TO THEIR OWN PARTIES
ONLY IF YOU DON'T COUNT DEMOCRACYNOW HETP AS THE PRESS
THANKS OBAMA
IT'S UNDER REPORTED PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY NORTH ARE RAISED THIS IS AN ANNOYANCE IT'S NOT WORTH REPORTING ON SOMETHING WE JUST WANT TO GO AWAY THE PROTESTORS ARE TRESPASSING AND WE WOULD ALL PREFER THEY GO HOME NON VIOLENTLY WE WANT THEM TO LIVE HAPPY AND HEALTHY LIVES THEY WILLIAM WHEN THEY PUT PLYWOOD OVER A BARBED WIRE FENCE TO GET ACCESS TO MORE LAND THAT ISN'T THEIRS WE ARE ALL MORE THAN HAPPY TO CHUCKLE AT THEIR EXPENSE OF GETTING HIT BY WATER THEN WE GO ABOUT OUR DAY NOT GIVING A FUCK ABOUT IT AND MAKING A LIVING BAR TALK IS ALL ABOUT HOW THEY'D PLOW THRU THE PROTESTORS OR PICK A FIGHT WITH THEM TALKS OF SHOOTING THEM THEMSELVES THEN WHEEL OF FORTUNE OR WHATEVER COMES ON AND WE CONTINUE WITH OUR LIVES

ND PEOPLE DON'T WANT NATIONAL ATTENTION FOR PIDDLY SHIT WE JUST WANT TO LIVE OUR LIVES IN PEACE AND AWAY FROM EXTREME BULLSHITTERY IT'S WHY WE CHOSE A DESOLATE ND LIFE
ALONG WITH OTHER INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL STORIES THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE CATCHING HEAT FOR THIS IS BECAUSE IT WENT VIRAL THE INVASIVE PESTS AND UNCONTROLLABLE DISEASES LITERALLY WIPING OUT OUR FORESTS ARE NOT SEXY ON SOCIAL MEDIA SO NO ONE IS PUSHING FOR THAT OR THE OTHER STORIES
I MEAN WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL THEY'RE JUST INDIANS
WAAH YOU'RE NOT GIVING USE ENOUGH MEDIA COVERAGE HOW ELSE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BREAK THE LAW
REAGAN DID IT GEORGE W DID IT NOW TRUMP IS TRYING LET THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES ONE MORE TIME BEFORE SUCH POISON IS MADE ILLEGAL
FRIGHTENING JUST FRIGHTENING
WHEN THE TREES CAN'T REACH THE GROUNDWATER YOURE IN TROUBLE THE GLACIAL WATER IS GOING LIKE THE DESERT
ARE WE JUST GOING BACKWARDS WHAT DO YOU THINK
I THINK YOU ACCIDENTALLY A WORD
PRETTY IDIOTIC TO COMPARE THE CARBON EMISSIONS ON A PER CALORIE BASIS YOU DON'T EAT VEGETABLES FOR CALORIES YOU EAT THEM FOR THEIR NUTRIENTS VITAMINS FIBER YOU COULD JUST AS EASILY SAY THAT GOING BY EMISSIONS PER MG OF VITAMIN C ORANGES ARE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE FOOD TO EAT A TRUE STATEMENT ALSO UTTERLY MEANINGLESS
YOU NEED TO CONSIDER SWITCHING FROM VEGETARIANISM TO VEGANISM THE DAIRY AND THE MEAT INDUSTRIES ARE INTERCONNECTED AND TOGETHER THEY ARE HAVING A HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
PALM OIL STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T HAVE SUSTAINABLE FARMED PALM OIL IT'S IN JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THE HARVESTING OF IT IS THE CAUSE SEVERAL KEY SPECIES IN SOUTH EAST ASIA TO BE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE CRUSTIER THAN YOUR HOUSE SET UP CURRENTLY BUT REUSING GREY WATER MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE YOU COULD RESEARCH SYSTEMS TO DO THIS HOUSEWIFE OR BE LAZY AND JUST REMOVE THE PIPES FROM YOUR SINKS AND PUT A LARGE BUCKET UNDERNEATH TO USE AGAIN FOR WATERING PLANTS FLUSHING THE TOILET ETC
BECOME CARBON NEUTRAL THERE IS A COST TO BUYING OFFSET CREDITS SO BE PREPARED FOR THAT ALSO WE HAVE SOLAR AND AN ELECTRIC CAR BUT THE SOLAR OUTPUT IS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH TO COVER THE ENERGY INPUT TO THE CAR COMMUTING BY BIKE IS A BETTER SOLUTION FINALLY EDUCATE OTHERS
GET INVOLVED WITH GREEN GROUPS EDF NATURE CONSERVANCY SWF ETC INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS ARE GREAT BUT WE NEED TO INFLUENCE CULTURE AND POLICY ON A MACRO LEVEL NOW AND WHATEVER YOU CAN SPARE IN TERMS OF HELP AND INVOLVEMENT BE GREATLY APPRECIATED
REDUCE OR COMPLETELY SWITCH OFF HEATING AND OR AC THIS OF COURSE WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE CLIMATE WHERE YOU LIVE THE FLAT WHERE I LIVE IS AT OFTEN GOING AS LOW AS BUT I DON'T MIND ONE MORE WOOLEN SWEATER AND I'M FINE THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IN A FLAT IS JUST A RECENTLY MADE UP SOCIAL CUSTOM UP UNTIL YEARS AGO IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE NO HEATING AT ALL BUT A FIREPLACE IN THE MAIN LIVING ROOM AND THEY DID JUST FINE GUESTS MAY HAVE SOME COMPLAINTS THOUGH BUT YOU KNOW YOU'D BE DOING DOING THE RIGHT THING
DO YOU HAVE A GARDEN FOR FOOD
WHERE'S YOU'RE ELECTRICITY COMING FROM IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE BUY RENEWABLE POWER VOTE GREEN AS WELL

PS AND GOOD ON YOU WELL DONE

THIS HAS BEEN POSTED NEARLY ALREADY TIMES IN THIS SUB ALONE




GOOD ATTACKING PROTESTORS IS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY AND DOESN'T BUILD CONFIDENCE
PROPER RESPONSE TO PROTEST ON PUBLIC PROPERTY OR CONSENTING PRIVATE PROPERTY HOSTS
SOLAR FREAKING ROADWAYS
I WOULD LOVE TO LIVE IN ONE OF THESE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT'S CURRENTLY GIVING ME FAITH IN HUMANITY WOULD LOVE TO WORK FOR THEM ON THIS
HOW WAS THIS SUBMITTED AGO WITH UPVOTES AND ZERO COMMENTS

I SMELL A NEW AUTOMATED MARKETING TRICK
I COULD DESIGN SOMETHING BETTER
HOWEVER PETROLEUM IN THE GROUND IS ALREADY SEQUESTERED CARBON THEY'RE THE REMAINS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT TOOK IN CARBON OVER THEIR LIFETIMES AND GOT LOCKED INTO THE GROUND OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING FROM PETROLEUM TO PLASTIC INVOLVES ENERGY AND CONTRIBUTES EMISSIONS OF ITS OWN IN THE END IT'S BETTER TO LEAVE PETROLEUM IN THE GROUND PLASTIC POLLUTION IS ALSO A HUGE PROBLEM IN OUR OCEANS AS WELL

IF YOU WERE TO SEQUESTER CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE AIR TO PLASTIC THOUGH YOU MIGHT BE ONTO SOMETHING THERE I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HAS INVESTIGATED INTO THAT BUT I IMAGINE SUCH A PROCESS IF IT EXISTS IS CURRENTLY LESS EFFICIENT COMPARED TO PLANTING A TREE AND LEAVING IT AS IT IS
THEY DO REALIZE WHO JUST GOT ELECTED RIGHT PROBABLY A BAD TIME TO BE A BUMBLEBEE
BUT WHICH BEE RELATED POLICIES WILL WE GET RID OF
IN SPITE OF THIS MONTH CHINA IS STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE PERHAPS FASTER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY IN COMBATTING CLIMATE CHANGE

CANADA IS STOPPING COAL BY

THE CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION IS BEING REGARDED AS INEVITABLE

THINGS CAN GET WORSE AND THEN BETTER
I POSTED THIS A FEW DAYS AGO

ALSO THIS HETP COUNTRIES REAFFIRM COMMITMENT TO PARIS CLIMATE DEAL ISOLATING TRUMP EVEN MORE I HONESTLY CAN'T THINK OF BETTER NEWS THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD COMMITTING TO LEAVE THE U SOUTH BEHIND I NEVER IMAGINED I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT BUT THERE IT IS
THEY USED FAIR MATH FINANCE ASSUMPTIONS WITHOUT INCENTIVES
I PARTICIPATED IN THIS SALE JUST FOR THIS REASON BOUGHT TWO SHIRTS FOR MY UPCOMING NICARAGUA TRIP
I REALLY WISH THERE WAS WIDER COVERAGE OF CHARITABLE COMPANY INITIATIVES LIKE THIS I WOULD HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE PATAGONIA SALE HAD I KNOW ABOUT IT
WISH I'D GOT THE BLACK HOLE JUST FOR THIS
I DIDN'T SEE ANY PARTICULAR GROUP OR FUND MENTIONED JUST IT WAS GOING TO THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH COULD BE THE LANDSCAPERS FOR ALL WE KNOW FROM THAT ARTICLE
HENDERSON CLAIMED THE DECISION WAS NECESSARY TO SHIELD THE PUBLIC FROM THE VIOLENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN PROTESTORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THIS AREA

AND THE VIOLENCE HAS ONLY BEEN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SECURITY WHO ARE HEAVILY ARMED AND USING MILITARY EQUIPMENT ON PEACEFUL PROTESTERS WHY DOESN'T HE ASK THEM TO STOP USING VIOLENCE ON AMERICAN CITIZENS USING THEIR THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PEACEFUL PROTEST
NEW RULE NO FREE SPEECH OUTSIDE THE FREE SPEECH ZONE YEAH THIS BODES WELL FOR THE FUTURE
OH SO WE'RE JUST GONNA RELOCATE THE NATIVES TO A SAFE SPOT WHERE THEY WON'T COME INTO CONFLICTS WITH WHITE FOLK
THIS GUY IS SUCH A FATALIST ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME SUSPICIOUS ABOUT HIS MOTIVATIONS EITHER THAT OR WE SHOULD QUESTION HIS CREDENTIALS TO SPEAK ON THIS MATTER JUST SAYING WE'RE ALL FUCKED SO LET'S GET ON WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL IS A SURE WAY TO ACTUALLY FUCK US AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE ENERGY AND CAPABILITY TO CHANGE THEN THAT IS THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO
A GOOD PLACE TO START IS THIS ARTICLE IT REALLY TAKES YOU BY THE HAND AND SHOWS YOU THE DATA IN NICE UNDERSTANDABLE GRAPHS IT FIRST SHOWS HOW CERTAIN THINGS DO NOT CORRELATE AND FINALLY SHOWS HOW GREENHOUSE GASSES AND ONLY GREENHOUSE GASSES ARE CAUSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INCREASE IN GREENHOUSE GASSES REALLY IS MANMADE
TWO OF THE MOST OBVIOUS SOURCES



EN
YEAH IT WILL TOTALLY BE TO COLD TO RUN THE MACHINES WITH THE HEATED CABS SO DON'T WORRY AT ALL I'M SURE THEY WILL DO THE HONORABLE THING AND WAIT TILL SPRING TO CONTINUE THIS
IT'D BE WARMER IF THEY HAD SOME NATURAL GAS OR OIL HUH

THEY SHOULD DEMAND SOLAR POWER FOR THEIR TRIBES IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS LAND
COULD HAVE HAD A MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE
WHAT IS THE BREAKTHROUGH TO MAKE TIN LAST LONGER
DTL IN A PAPER

IN OTHER WORDS IT'S COMING IN YEARS
KIND OF NEGATES THE POINT OF HAVING THE SEED VAULT UP THERE DOESN'T IT
SHE WAS AN AMAZING GOVERNOR FOR US AND WE ARE VERY SAD TO SEE HER GO SHE WAS A STEADY HAND AT THE WHEEL
HE SOLD IT THIS SUMMER

DALLAS NEWS
WHILE I CARE NOT FOR TRUMP HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS YET TO TAKE OVER SO ISN'T THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THE ONES SENDING THEIR GOONS
WATER IS WET
AND THE VIOLENCE USED AGAINST THE PROTESTERS ARE BUT A TASTE OF WHAT'S TO COME UNDER A REGIME OF TRUMP AUTOCRACY
WHY DON'T THE UNBIASED TEENS OVER AT R TALK ABOUT THIS
WITH AS MUCH MONEY AS HE HAS INVESTED HE PROBABLY OWNS STOCK IN ALMOST EVERYTHING WORTH HAVING STOCK IN
BUT YA KNOW THAT'S MESSING WITH THE FREE MARKET CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN TO THEM BUT IF THEY DO IT ITS PERFECTLY FINE AND JUSTIFIED
I REALLY THINK THIS IS THE ANTI SCIENCE MOVEMENT'S LAST STANDARD THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT ALREADY LOST BY SUPPORTING TRUMP TIME TO TAKE ON CLIMATE DENIAL

I'M HOPEFUL ON THIS ONE
HE IS SUCH A STUPID MOTHERFUCKER I AM GODDAMN ASHAMED OF MY COUNTRY WHEN I THINK OF ALL OF THE FUCKING SLOPE BROWED DIPSHITS WHO VOTED HIM IN
TRUMP AND PENCE ARE BOTH CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS
TRUMP IS READY TO DRIVE THE ECONOMY RIGHT INTO A DITCH AND CASH IN THE WHOLE WAY
I WONDER IF THAT FECAL PUCK IS ANTI CLIMATE CHANGE SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS A BONE TO PICK WITH OFFSHORE WIND FARMS
PULLING OUT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN RECONSIDER
YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS BEST CASE SCENARIO I'M TALKING BEST CASE HERE WE FIND A WAY TO STOP CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE GET OFF COAL AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF ENERGY YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS THEN PEOPLE MOCK THE IDEA OF GLOBAL WARMING THEY'LL SAY LOOK AT THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN WE TOLD YOU IT WAS MADE UP THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE OZONE LAYER PROBLEM HELL EVEN THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF WORK WENT INTO MAKING NOTHING AND SO MUCH EFFORT WENT INTO MAKING THE OZONE LAYER HOLE NOTHING I'M AFRAID THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO GLOBAL WARMING TOO SO COME TIME FOR THE NEXT ECOLOGICAL DISASTER NO ONE'S GOING TO BELIEVE IT AGAIN
A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DIDN'T ELECT TRUMP IN THE FIRST PLACE STILL HE GIVES THE WAY TO GO NOW
WELL THE MAJORITY SHOULD HAVE VOTED AGAINST HIM HE WAS ELECTED BY THE AMERICANS AFTER ALL
THE TIME FOR AMERICA TO INVEST IN RENEWABLE RESOURCES WAS SEVERAL DECADES AGO YET TRUMP WANTS TO BRING BACK COAL JOBS HE LITERALLY WANTS TO HAVE AMERICA RELY ON A DYING INDUSTRY
I'M SURE THEY'LL FIND A WAY TO BLAME OBAMA
AUSTRALIA ISN'T ON THAT LIST I BET
ITS ALL ABOUT REGULATION AND CORPORATIONS SOMETHING G LIKE HALF THE COMES FROM THE LARGEST CARGO SHIPS

CORPORATIONS OR PEOPLE CAN ELIMINATE HALF THE WORLDS EMISSIONS

THEN WE NEED TO PLANT A TON OF TREES AND GET A SUPER METHANE FIXER
TOO BAD THE US IS ABOUT TO COMMIT TO POLLUTING AT A LEVEL AS TO CANCEL OUT ANY GAINS AND ANY HOPE OF A FUTURE
CRAP

THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR TRUMP TO BRING BACK THE COAL INDUSTRY
MORE LIKE TWO MAJOR COUNTRIES AND SOME OTHERS
HUMAN CAUSED CLIMA CHANGE IS BULLSHIT WAKE UP
THE FRIGHTENING THING IS THAT WE HAVE ONLY HAD A DEGREE OF WARMING SO FAR SINCE TIMES PROFESSOR HUGHES SAID ADDING THAT THE RATE OF WARMING WILL BE THREE TIMES EVEN IF NATIONS PERFECTLY KEPT PROMISES MADE IN THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT

THE CHANGES THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH DEGREES ARE ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE

SO WE ARE NOW AT DEGREES AS THE BEST OUTCOME THE MINIMUM WARMING WE CAN ACHIEVE ITS NOT 2 DEGREES ANY MORE ITS HOLY CRAP

MAN CONSIDERING WHAT A BEATING ASPHALT GETS I CAN'T IMAGINE THESE BEING DURABLE ENOUGH
MULTIPLE ENGINEERS HAVE ANALYZED THE SOLAR ROADWAY CONCEPT AND EACH HAS CONCLUDED IT'S A BAD IDEA

AMP AMP CLIENT
SOLAR ROOFTOPS SMART

SOLAR ROADS STUPID

USE THE SPACE WE DON'T USE AND ROOFTOPS ARE UNDISTURBED FRAGILE PANELS ARE FINE ALTHOUGH I THINK THE SOLAR CITY TESLA SHINGLES ARE A MAYBE FOR THE NEW ROOF WE'LL NEED IN YEARS

PLUS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT RAINS GLASS IS SLIPPERY IF THEY TEXTURE IT IT WILL STILL WEAR DOWN SMOOTH IN HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS ROADS ARE ABRASIVE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE STRUCTURE SO WHEN THEY WEAR THEY STILL HAVE GRIP
CARS ARE THE PROBLEM NOT ROADS FM
PUBLIC LIGHT THAT'S ONLY NEEDED AT NIGHT IF THE SOLAR ROAD COULD HEAT READ TO BE SNOW FREE AND OR WIRELESS CHARGE THEN WE ARE TALKING
I SEE A LOT SOLAR ROAD BASHING ITT AND OTHER POSTS ABOUT SOLAR ROADS HERE ARE SOME COUNTER ARGUMENTS FROM THE ARTICLE
A SUBSIDIARY OF BOUYGUES SA HAS DESIGNED RUGGED SOLAR PANELS CAPABLE OF WITHSTAND THE WEIGHT OF AN WHEELER TRUCK THAT THEY RE NOW BUILDING INTO ROAD SURFACES AFTER NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF RESEARCH AND LABORATORY TESTS THEY RE CONSTRUCTING OUTDOOR TEST SITES AND PLAN TO COMMERCIALIZE THE TECHNOLOGY IN EARLY
TO RESIST THE WEIGHT OF TRAFFIC WASTEWAY LAYERS SEVERAL TYPES OF PLASTICS TO CREATE A CLEAR AND DURABLE CASING THE SOLAR PANEL UNDERNEATH IS AN ORDINARY MODEL SIMILAR TO PANELS ON ROOFTOPS THE ELECTRICAL WIRING IS EMBEDDED IN THE ROAD AND THE CONTRAPTION IS TOPPED BY AN SURFACE MADE FROM CRUSHED GLASS

SO THE MAIN POINTS ARE

IT'S STILL IN THE EARLY TEST PHASE COST AND EXPERIENCE ARE NOT PERFECT
IT'S BEING DESIGNED TO BE DURABLE
THEY ARE USING CRUSHED GLAS FOR THE SLIP PROBLEMS TIME WILL TELL IF THAT WORKS

MY OPINION

SOLAR ROADS HAVE ADDED BENEFIT OF PROVIDING A POWER LINE ALONG A PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS ALREADY THERE INSTEAD OF CUTTING THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE ELSEWHERE
SOLAR ROADS ARE PROBABLY MORE DURABLE THAN ASPHALT AND MORE SUSTAINABLE WHEN LESS OIL IS REFINED
FUTURE SOLAR TECH HAS POTENTIAL TO BE MORE ROBUST AND COULD BE MORES SUITED FOR ROADS SO HAVING SOME EXPERIENCE BEFOREHAND MAKES THE INTRO SMOOTHER




IT IS NOT JUST PROPERTY OWNERS BUYERS AND SELLERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE REAL ESTATE MARKET THESE RISKS COMPOUND AS INDIVIDUAL MORTGAGES GET BUNDLED AND SOLD AS SECURITIES IN HIS APRIL REPORT MR BECKETT THE FREDDIE MAC ECONOMIST EMPHASIZED HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO PREDICT WHETHER THE BUBBLE IN COASTAL REAL ESTATE WOULD SLOWLY DEFLATE OR SUDDENLY POPULAR

WILL THE VALUE OF THE HOUSE DECLINE GRADUALLY AS THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE HOUSE BECOMES SHORTER HE WROTE OR ALTERNATIVELY WILL THE VALUE OF THE HOUSE AND ALL THE HOUSES AROUND IT PLUNGE THE FIRST TIME A LENDER REFUSES TO MAKE A MORTGAGE ON A NEARBY HOUSE OR AN INSURER REFUSES TO ISSUE A HOMEOWNER S POLICY


COASTAL MORTGAGES ARE GROWING INTO AS BIG A BUBBLE AS THE HOUSING MARKET OF SAID PHILIP STODDARD THE MAYOR OF SOUTH MIAMI BUT THIS TIME HE SAID THERE WILL NOT BE A REBOUND BECAUSE THE WATERS WILL NOT RECEDE AND PROPERTIES WILL EVENTUALLY LOSE ALL OF THEIR VALUE

SO ICE FREE ARCTIC BY AND PERMANENTLY ICE FREE ARCTIC BY CAN I START PANICKING OR DO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE TV TO TELL ME TO PANIC
R COLLAPSE AND R ENVIRONMENT SEEM TO OVERLAP MORE AND MORE THESE DAYS BAD NEWS
KINDA NEAT THAT I'M ALIVE TO WITNESS THE END OF THE WORLD BUT ALSO KIND OF A BUMMER
I HEARD A GUY SAID THAT THE HOTTEST DAY WAS ACTUALLY IN THE OR SOMETHING SO THIS PROBABLY NO BIG DEAL S
NUMBER IS TRULY TERRIFYING THOUGH THEY ALL ARE AWFUL

MONBIOT IS NORMALLY A HOPEFUL AND POSITIVE WRITER SEE HIS AWESOME BOOK FERAL IF INCISIVE AND UNFORGIVING IN HIS POLITICAL COMMENTARY SO TO SEE THIS FROM HIM OOF RIGHT IN THE FEELS
NONE OF THESE ARE IMPOSSIBLE I HATE THE GUARDIAN
REMINDS ME OF INTERSTELLAR
I ACTUALLY REALLY ENJOYED THIS DOCUMENTARY SOME OF THIS STUFF I HAD READ BEFORE BUT A LOT OF IT WAS NEWS TO ME I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T FANS OF LEO BUT NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR THIS FROM ME
WE COULD ALL LIVE VERY WELL USING ONLY OF THE ENERGY WE USE NOW
I'M SO ANGRY OVER THIS YET I FEEL SO HELPLESS LIKE WHAT CAN I TRULY DO I HAVE ONLY ENOUGH MONEY FOR MYSELF TO SURVIVE I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE
WHY IS THIS BEING DONE ONLY NOW
WITH FALLIN RECENTLY DECLARING OCTOBER AS A DAY OF PRAYER FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY IN HER STATE

WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GRAND CANYON DADDY WELL THE CORPORATIONS TURNED IT INTO MORDOR BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD RATHER GO ONTO FACEBOOK THAN STAND UP AND PROTEST
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION RUSHES TO PROTECT PUBLIC LANDS BEFORE TRUMP TAKES OFFICE

WHY ARE THEY ONLY DOING THIS NOW
NORTH DAKOTA IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE REASONS
IS THERE OIL UNDER THE GRAND CANYON
LET THOSE IDIOTS WHO VOTED FOR HIM DRINK BRACKING FLUID WHEN THEY TRY TO LEAVE THEIR POISONED LAND I WILL MEET THEM AT THE BORDER WITH GUNS AND SIGNS THAT READ NOT MY PROBLEM AND GO BACK HOME
HE COULD HAVE DONE THIS YEARS AGO

PROCRASTINATION IS A BITCH
NOTE FOR YEARS NO SPECIFIC MATCHING MOVE TO PROTECT ONLY WHEN IN LAST WEEKS OF POWER IS THERE A MOVE TO SUDDENLY DO WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE PREVIOUSLY APPEARANCE IS EVERYTHING WITH THESE CREATURES INTERESTING
WOOHOO LOOK AT YOU YOU'RE HELPING THANKS OBAMA

BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE BRUTALITY THAT'S HAPPENING IN STANDING ROCK

SILENCE
OBAMA SHOULD HAVE ENDORSED A TRUE LEADER INSTEAD OF THAT CORRUPT COW IF THAT HAD HAPPENED WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS AND THE OUTLOOK ON THE ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE A FUCK TONNE BRIGHTER
I FELT LIKE WE COULD ALL USE SOME GOOD NEWS EVEN IF TRUMP AND HIS MORONS ARE DETERMINED TO SEND US HURTLING BACK TO THE STONE AGE IT SEEMS NOT ALL THE REST OF OUR COUNTRY IS DRINKING THE
TONNES OF SEQUESTERED PER HOUSE MINUS FOR CONSTRUCTION NET TONNES SOMEONE ELSE CAN CONVERT TO AMERICAN UNITS WHAT HAPPENS IN YEARS WHEN IT'S AND REBUILT
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE BROODING CROONER THAT'S LIKE POLISHING THE BRASS ON THE TITANIC
WHAT IS RUNNING OUT IS AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF FRESH CLEAN WATER WITH WHICH TO RUN MODERN CIVILIZATION
WELL AMOUNT OF WATER WORLDWIDE IS BASICALLY FIXED ONLY VERY SMALL AMOUNTS CAME FROM OCCASIONAL METEORITES SO WORLD IS NOT RUNNING OUT OF WATER JUST SOME PARTS OF IT ARE
WE HOPE SO
WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IF THE SOIL RUNS OUT
RESEARCH LIKE THIS JUST MAKES ME MORE AND MORE AFRAID FOR WHAT KIND OF WORLD FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL LIVE IN
WRONG
MAN IF ONLY FINLAND EXISTED
GREAT WORK FINLAND FROM YOUR BROTHER SWEDEN
FUCK IT HERE IN AMERICA OUR PRESIDENT-ELECT DOESN'T EVEN BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE
REALLY SEEMS LIKE THESE SCANDINAVIAN AND SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE ADJUSTING FAST HOPE THEY REALLY IMPLEMENT WHAT THEY ARE PROMISING
GREAT NEWS I'M EXCITED TO HEAR FINLAND IS GOING AHEAD IN PHASING OUT COAL I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE PLANS TO PHASE OUT COAL IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE AS AN AMERICAN I'M HAPPY THAT OREGON IS ALSO PASSING LAWS TO BAN COAL BUT I AM CONCERNED FOR THE UNITED STATES IN THE COMING YEARS I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE I DO AS MUCH AS I CAN TO MAKE CLIMATE CHANGE AN ISSUE SO WE WON'T BE LEFT BEHIND
BUT BUT WHY DON'T THEY JUST USE THE CLEAN COAL WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT
THANKS FINLAND FROM ARIZONA
THANK YOU FINLAND
RETARD DENIER I'LL LAUGH WHEN IT'S YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WHO ARE THE NEXT VICTIMS OF ASW



IS THE WEBSITE OF COMMITTEE FOR A CONSTRUCTIVE TOMORROW EMPLOYEE MARC MORANO A CONSERVATIVE GLOBAL WARMING DENIER WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR A VOCAL POLITICAL DENIER OF CLIMATE CHANGE REPUBLICAN SEN JAMES INHOFE LAUNCHED IN SPRING CLIMATE DEPOT CLAIMED IT WOULD BE THE SENATE EPW WEBSITE ON STEROIDS AND THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION CENTER ON CLIMATE NEWS AND THE RELATED ISSUES OF ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY







CLIMATE DEPOT
CLIMATE DENIAL PLAYBOOK MARC HISTORY OF BULLYING SCIENTISTS



IF YOU'VE EVEN HEARD OF MARC MORANO YOU PROBABLY WATCHED HIM ANGRILY ATTACKING A CLIMATE SCIENTIST JOURNALIST OR AL GORE ON FOX NEWS OR ON HIS BLOG CLIMATE DEPOT A PROJECT OF THE DONORS TRUST AND OIL COACT MORANO IS SO AGITATED IN HIS CLIMATE DENIAL THAT HE ONCE ADVOCATED THAT CLIMATE SCIENTISTS BE PUBLICLY FLOGGED

ORIGINALLY A PRODUCER FOR THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW MORANO ASCENDED DESCENDED TO THE POSITION OF COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR SEN JAMES INHOFE WHERE HE HELPED HIS BOSS TO ABUSE THE POWER OF THE SENATE HEARINGS PROCESS TO ATTACK CLIMATE SCIENCE AND PROMOTE CONSPIRACY THEORIES INHOFE AND MORANO WERE CORRECTED AND DEBUNKED ENDLESSLY BUT FACTS HAVE PROVEN NO OBSTACLE TO CRUSADE AGAINST SCIENCE CONFIRMING THE ROLE OF FOSSIL FUEL POLLUTION IN DRIVING GLOBAL WARMING

I AM NEW HERE AND THIS IS MY FIRST COMMENT LOTS OF INTERESTING STUFF HERE THIS IS SUCH A GREAT POST KEEP IT UP
THE TEAM ADMITS THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS JUST YET BUT THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLAR VORTEX AND ARCTIC ICE LOSS IS WORTH INVESTIGATING FURTHER

WHICH WILL BE TRANSLATED TO PEOPLE ARE BAD IF THIS STORY EVER HITS MAINSTREAM MEDIA
THIS
AGREED BORDERS REALLY MESS WITH MIGRATION PATTERNS AND HABITATS OF ALL LIVING ORGANISMS
WELL IT PROBABLY IS BASICALLY LOST IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE AFTER ALL ENVIRONMENTALISM AS AN IDENTIFIABLE MOVEMENT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES AND WE HAVE STATUTES ON THE BOOKS TO PROVE ITS EFFECTIVENESS BUT YES IT'S A LOSING BATTLE THE PROBLEMS ARE MAINLY THE RESULT OF RUNAWAY HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH COUPLED WITH OUR LIMITED CAPACITY TO ACT PROACTIVELY

I RECOMMEND THAT YOU KEEP ON DOING THE THINGS YOU DO LET'S KEEP BUSY BAILING WATER FROM THIS SINKING BOAT EVEN IF IT'S ULTIMATELY FUTILE WE CAN AT LEAST SAY THAT WE PITCHED IN AND TRIED TO DO SOMETHING MEANWHILE LUCKY US WE HAVE A RINGSIDE SEAT TO VIEW THE SIXTH GREAT EXTINCTION
WELL THERE'S THE OLD RECOMMENDATION IF YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE SITUATION CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE

GRANTED THAT'S KIND OF BUDDHIST OR STOIC THING TO SAY BUT IT STILL RINGS TRUE
IT'S NOT JUST DENIERS MOST PEOPLE HAVEN'T GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENT A THOUGHT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AS EVIDENCED BY INTERVIEWER IN THIS EXAMPLE
I'M WATCHING FRIENDS ON NETFLIX
PRETTY NAIVE STATEMENT IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE WORLD IS ACCUSTOMED TO RADICAL CHANGE AND HOW IT HAS ADAPTED IN THE PAST THE WORLD WILL ENDURE OUR SPECIES WILL SUFFER THOUGH
WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT SCIENCE COULD EASILY FIT INTO HIS TINY TINY LEFT HAND
TRUMPS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IS SO OBVIOUS IT JUST BLOWS MY MIND HOW SOME PEOPLE DON'T SEE IT EVERY TIME I HEAR HIS VOICE I HONESTLY AM JUST TAKEN BACK LOL IS THIS REALLY OUR BEST
ENTRIES ICONS ORIGINAL


WUT
BY HIGH LEVELS YOU MEAN BELOW DANGEROUS LIMITS

THE EPA HAS REEXAMINED GLYPHOSATE AND HAS FOUND THAT IT POSES NO CANCER RISK ONLY ONE WING OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS ACCUSED GLYPHOSATE OF POTENTIALLY BEING DANGEROUS THE AARC AND THAT REPORT HAS COME UNDER FIRE FROM MANY PEOPLE SUCH AS THE BOARD FOR AUTHORISATION OF PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS AND BIOCIDES IN THE NETHERLANDS AND THE GERMAN FEDERAL INSTITUTE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT PDF SEVERAL OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE DEEMED GLYPHOSATE SAFE TOO SUCH AS UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY THE SOUTH AFRICAN DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FORESTRY FISHERIES PDF THE AUSTRALIAN PESTICIDES AND VETERINARY MEDICINES AUTHORITY PDF THE SWISS FEDERAL OFFICE FOR AGRICULTURE BELGIAN FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICE HEALTH FOOD CHAIN SAFETY ENVIRONMENT THE ARGENTINE INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENTIFIC COUNCIL AND CANADIAN PEST MANAGEMENT REGULATORY AGENCY FURTHERMORE THE CONCLUSION CONFLICTS WITH THE OTHER THREE MAJOR RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE WHO THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM ON CHEMICAL SAFETY THE CORE ASSESSMENT GROUP AND THE GUIDES FOR QUALITY HETP



AL GORE THANKS YOU
THE CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS WILL JUMP ON THIS ONE
NO SURPRISE IN THIS THINGS ARE CHANGING WITHIN ONLY A FEW GENERATIONS WHILE YES THIS WILL FORCE A SOMEWHAT RAPID EVOLUTIONARY EVENT IT IS STILL TOO FAST FOR EVEN THAT TO WORK OUT WELL
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE PIECE OF GARBAGE THAT ARTICLE IS CLICKBAIT AT BEST AND JUNK SCIENCE AT WORST

ECOLOGISTS ANALYSED HOW QUICKLY SPECIES HAD CHANGED THEIR CLIMATIC NICHES OVER TIME AND HOW THESE RATES COMPARED WITH THAT OF GLOBAL WARMING

RATES OF CHANGE IN CLIMATIC NICHES WERE MUCH SLOWER THAN RATES OF PROJECTED CLIMATE CHANGE BY MORE THAN FOLD FOR TEMPERATURE ON AVERAGE THEY SAID

SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT THE RATE AT WHICH SPECIES ARE ACTUALLY MOVING IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE IS TIMES LESS THAN THE PROJECTED RATE OF CLIMATE CHANGE

IN OTHER WORDS ANIMALS AREN'T MOVING BECAUSE THEY DON'T FUCKING NEED TO BECAUSE THE CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS ARE ALL WRONG AS ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN KEEPING TRACK OF THE FEARMONGERING OVER THE LAST YEARS HAS NOTICED

WAY TO SPIN THIS INTO PROPAGANDA ON PAR WITH ANYTHING IN
IT'S LIKE SOME ALTERNATE UNIVERSE WHERE FACTS MEAN THEIR OPPOSITE

HE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT TREATY LANDS LEGALLY CLAIMED AND DEFENDED BY A SOVEREIGN INDIGENOUS NATION

THE SUPREME COURT RULING LINKED TO SAYS THAT THE US TOOK THAT LAND BY EMINENT DOMAIN AND JUST COMPENSATION HAD TO BE PAID IN OTHER WORDS IT'S NOW US LAND NOT TRIBAL LAND
OF COURSE THE AUTHOR WHEELS THE R WORD OUT WITH ITS TANK OF OXYGEN BUT THE ONLY THING RACIST I SEE IN THIS ARTICLE IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS IS A RACE ISSUE AT ALL THE LEFT ARE PRETENDING IT'S A WHITE AGAINST EVERYONE ELSE ISSUE LIKE THEY DO WITH EVERYTHING IT'S A BIG MONEY VERSUS THE PUBLIC ISSUE

AS FAR AS INDIGENOUS RIGHTS GO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE NO PEOPLE YEARS OLD LEFT AND JUST AS THE AUSTRALIAN WHITE DESCENDANTS OF THE IRISH POLITICAL PRISONERS RESISTING BRITISH COLONIALISM AND THE ENGLISH POOR SENT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET FOR STEALING FOOD TO SURVIVE GET NOTHING BY WAY OF COMPENSATION I DON'T KNOW WHY OTHERS EXPECT TO BE COMPENSATED FOR WHAT WAS DONE GENERATIONS AGO SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE CORRECT RACE

SHOULD THOSE WITH WHITE AND INDIGENOUS BLOOD PAY THEMSELVES IT'S RIDICULOUS

I MEAN IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THE FUCKING BELGIANS COULD HAVE COLONIZED AUSTRALIA AND NORTH AMERICA
CAN WE GET A STORY ON CLIMATE THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A GYPSY LOOKING INTO A CRYSTAL BALL
I HAVE A SECRET FOR YOU THE EARTH WILL BE HERE LONG AFTER THE LAST ONE OF US IS GONE

IN THE LONG RUN WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING THAT WILL HARM THE EARTH ONLY OUR ABILITY TO SURVIVE ON IT

BEING PRO ENVIRONMENT IS BEING PRO HUMAN
ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN LOWERING POLLUTION SAVES STOPPING CLIMATE CHANGE PREVENTS DISASTERS A BETTER ENVIRONMENT MEANS HEALTHIER HUMANS A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT BENEFITS BOTH PARTIES
BEING IS BEING
BUMMER ABOUT TRADER
WHAT IF I WANT TO PROTECT PESTICIDES FROM BEES
ARE WE STILL PRETENDING THAT THE BEES ARE DYING
SILLY TITLE HIS TALKING POINTS WERE EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD EXPECT

WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THESE ABSURD TALKING POINTS LONG BEFORE TRUMP WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT

DONALD OPINION ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND REALITY IS EXACTLY AS DUMB AS I THOUGHT IT WAS
HE JUST DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT HE'S AN OLD MAN WHO WILL BE LUCKY TO LIVE THROUGH HIS TERM IN OFFICE HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT THE PLANET WILL BE LIKE IN A DECADE LET ALONE HALF A CENTURY
THAT WOULD TAKE A LOT I'VE SET THE BAR VERY LOW FOR HIM
MY UNCLE WAS FOR YEARS A PROFESSOR AT MASCULINE I TENSE HE WAS A GREAT ENGINEER SCIENTIST HE WAS A GREAT GUY AND HE WAS A LONG TIME AGO HE HAD FEELINGS THIS WAS A LONG TIME AGO HE HAD FEELINGS ON THIS SUBJECT IT S A VERY COMPLEX SUBJECT I M NOT SURE ANYBODY IS EVER GOING TO REALLY KNOW

HIS UNCLE HAD FEELINGS
I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE EXPECT THIS GUY TO CLEAN UP CORRUPTION IN WASHINGTON

WE JUST PUT A BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN IN THE MOST POWERFUL OFFICE IN THE ONE MECHANISM WE HAVE FOR CONTROLLING BIG BUSINESS

HOW COULD THERE NOT BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
SURPRISE TRUMP IS A FUCKING NUMBSKULL
I DON'T KNOW I CAN IMAGINE A LOT
EVEN IF YOU LIKE DONALD TRUMP YOU HAVE TO AGREE THAT THE WAY HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF IS LIKE HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S SAYING HE'S TALKING LIKE SOMEONE WHO WAS NO IDEA OF THE SUBJECT BUT TRIES TO ACT LIKE HE DOES I'M NOT SAYING HE'S STUPID OR DUMB BUT BEING WELL SPOKEN IS PRETTY IMPORTANT FOR A PRESIDENT
GOD DAMN IT AMERICA WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE HONESTLY
THIS ON THE RECORD MEETING WITH THE NY TIMES EXEMPLIFIES HIS UTTER LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND CURIOSITY ABOUT THE WORLD HE HAS NO DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE ON ANYTHING OF REAL IMPORT IN OUR MODERN WORLD AND IS A COMPLETE EMPTY SUIT AS THE RIGHT USED TO SAY ABOUT OBAMA WE ARE IN FOR A SCARY AND EMBARRASSING YEARS AMERICA
AMERICA DISMANTLING ONE ESTABLISHMENT FOR A DUMBER ONE
I HAVE A TOTALLY OPEN MIND
THE BIRD ADJUSTMENT TO WINDMILLS ISSUE SHOULD NOT BE RAISED PEOPLE DIE JUST BEING AROUND COAL AND JUST MOVING OIL AROUND BLOWS UP WHOLE TOWNS OR DOES FAR WORSE ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE THROUGH LEAKS
I HATE THAT TITLE QUIT TELLING ME HOW TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING AND JUST GIVE ME THE INFO AND I'LL DECIDE FOR MYSELF
SO SOMEONE DUCK TAPE HIS MOUTH SHUT AND SIT HIM DOWN FOR A SHORT CLIMATE SCIENCE LESSON THE DUCK TAPE IS A NECESSITY OR HE WONT HEAR THE LESSON SOMEONE JUST PLEASE EDUCATE THE MANUAL
INFURIATING
I HAVE SOME GREAT GREAT VERY SUCCESSFUL GOLF COURSES I VE RECEIVED SO MANY ENVIRONMENTAL AWARDS FOR THE WAY I VE DONE YOU KNOW I VE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK WHERE I VE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS NUMBERS SOMETIMES I LL SAY I M ACTUALLY AN ENVIRONMENTALIST AND PEOPLE WILL SMILE IN SOME CASES AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME UNDERSTAND THAT S TRUE

PRESIDENT ELECT DONALD TRUMP ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY
GOOD GOD
HE REALLY REPRESENTS THE CARS IN THE DRIVEWAY AMERICAN PEOPLE

ALL IS DOES IS RAMBLE SAY SOMETHING WORTH SAYING IT'S LIKE A SHITTY ESSAY THAT HAS THEN AND BUT JUST A BUNCH OF USELESS WORDS THAT HAS NO MEANING OR DIRECTION
THE FUNNY THING IS THAT WHAT HE ACTUALLY DECIDES HAS LITTLE WITH WHAT HE HAS SAID IN THE PAST WHAT INFLUENCES HIS DECISIONS ARE MORE WHAT IRKS HIM IN THE NEWS AT THE MOMENT ESPECIALLY IF IT IS ABOUT HIM
I DON'T KNOW
SO YOU POKE THE BEAR
IS IT REALLY DUMBER THAN I COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE I COULD IMAGINE SOME PRETTY DUMB SHIT
IN EVER WAY AND IN EVER CHOICE HE'S PROVING TO BE EXACTLY WHAT I FEARED HE MIGHT BE
WHAT DID HIS UNCLE THINK
I DON'T KNOW I CAN IMAGINE SOME REALLY DUMB SHIT
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDIES PERFORMED BEFORE A MAJOR PROJECT SUCH AS A PIPELINE OR POWER PLANT HAVE TO DO WITH THE COST BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION HE'S SPEAKING LIKE A BUSINESS MAN WHOSE EXPERIENCE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IS IMPACT STUDIES FOR GOLF COURSES LET'S MAXIMIZE PROFIT WHILE BARELY SKIMMING UNDER THE LIMBO BAR OF REGULATIONS OH AND HE PROCLAIMS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL CUT REGULATIONS IN HALF HE THINKS IN TERMS OF QUARTERLY PROFITS NOT GENERATIONAL PROBLEMS AND THIS IS THE RESULT
HE DOESN'T HAVE A PUBLIC OPINION HE HAS A TALKING POINT WHICH CHANGES AS HE NEEDS IT TO CHANGE WHATEVER HIS OPINION IS IT IS IRRELEVANT TO WHAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH
I DON'T KNOW TRUMP I KNOW THE SHOW HE PUT ON TO GET ELECTED BUT ITS FOOLISH TO THINK WE KNOW HIM
WHAT A COMPLETELY MORONIC TITLE PRESENT HIS VIEWPOINTS AND EXPLAIN WHY THEY ARE WRONG INSTEAD OF THIS CLICKBAIT IDIOCY
IS IT TRUE EVERY PLANET IS HEATING UP SERIOUS QUESTION
I'M A PROFESSOR OF CLIMATE SCIENCE AT MIT AND THE CONSENSUS IS THAT THE THREAT IS REAL BUT EXTREMELY OVER EXAGGERATED SO TRUMP IS NOT WRONG PEOPLE DO NOT NEED TO WORRY FOR YEARS OR SO THAT'S WHY I BURN ALL MY TRASH IN MY BACKYARD IT'S A GOOD WAY TO SAVE A FEW BUCKINGHAMSHIRE
THE EARTH HAS BEEN WARMING FOR S OF YEARS IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE HUMAN CAUSES THAT PEOPLE WANT FUNDING FOR IT HAS TO DO WITH A GIANT BALL OF FIRE AND GRAVITY
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WOULD REPLACE NASA S FOCUS ON GLOBAL WARMING WITH EFFORTS TO SEND HUMANS INTO SPACE

I GUESS YOU BETTER HAVE THE LATTER IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE FORMER
NASA IS THE MOST APOLITICAL ORGANIZATION I CAN THINK OF JESUS IS THERE A CHECK BALANCE AGAINST THIS INSANITY
CANADA WENT THROUGH THIS WITH OUR LAST BARASHIT INSANE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT FUCK HARPER THEY DEFENDED SCIENCE AND BANNED ANY SCIENTIST FROM TALKING TO THE MEDIA UNLESS IT WAS APPROVED ESPECIALLY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS TOOK US THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE TO GET RID OF THEM AND OUR NEW GOVERNMENT SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS BASICALLY DISMANTLING THE LAST GOVERNMENTS POLICIES

DARK DAYS

THIS IS A HUGE RED FLAG GUYS YOU NEED TO FIGHT THIS TOOTH AND NAIL BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY DEFUNDING CLIMATE SCIENCE IS A SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS TACTIC AND IT WORKS WE HAVE SEEN IT IN ACTION ESPECIALLY NOW THAT OUR SCIENTISTS CAN TALK AGAIN THEY HAVE BROUGHT MANY PROBLEMS TO LIGHT WE ONLY GET ONE PLANET AND THIS IDIOT THAT GOT ELECTED WILL BE TURNING BACK THE CLOCK TO THE S WHILE THE REST OF THE WORLD MOVES FORWARD INTO A CLEAN FUTURE
FACTS OFTEN HAVE A LIBERAL BIAS
CAN NASA SCRAP TRUMP AS OUR PRESIDENT
I LIKE HOW THE PEOPLE WHO WE'RE DIRECTLY INVESTED BY MUDDYING THE WATER BY TRYING TO MAKE IT POLITICAL ARE NOW SAYING THE SCIENCE IS TOO POLITICAL

NOT ONLY IS SAYING CLIMATE CHANGE IS POLITICAL HORSE SHIT ITS ALSO PRETTY SCARY BECAUSE IF THEY GET THEIR WAY AND NEW RESEARCH IS DONE NOT LOOKING TO BE POLITICAL SURPRISE SURPRISE CLIMATE CHANGE WONT LOOK NEARLY AS SCARY BECAUSE IF IT DID IT'D BE TOO POLITICAL

MY GENERATION WILL BE THE ONE TO SEE THE TRUE DAMAGE WE HAVE CAUSED THIS PLANET OUR KIDS AND OUR KID'S KIDS ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME
ONLY BECAUSE HE JUST POLITICISED IT
MF
WAIT DOES THE US PRESIDENT HAVE THE POWER TO DICTATE WHERE FUNDING GOES IN NASA AND HOW IT IS USED
I THINK THE THING THAT WILL FINALLY TURN A LOT OF RED STATE VOTERS OFF ON TRUMP IS WHEN ALL THE WILDLIFE FINALLY DIES OR IS KEPT IN ZOO'S AND PRIVATE GAME PARKS AND THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SHOOT BUT ROAD SIGNS AND THEMSELVES
GREAT HE JUST MADE IT EVEN MORE POLITICAL

MAYBE IF POLITICIANS FROM BOTH PARTIES ACCEPTED IT AS FACT IT WOULDN'T BE A LEFTIST ISSUE
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S POLITICIZING IT FUCKING HELL
WOULDN'T SCRAPPING IT BE POLITICIZING IT AS WELL ANYONE ELSE SEE THE IRONY HERE
DO YOU EVER WONDER IF THE REST OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD MAY JUST COME TOGETHER WITH A MILITARY COALITION TO JUST DEFEAT THE U SOUTH GOVERNMENT IN AN ACT TO SAVE THE EARTH FROM FRYING SEEMS EXTREME BUT WONDER IF THAT COULD HAPPEN
BECAUSE THEIR ECONOMY IS IN THE TOILET AND THEY ARE RELYING ON OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS TO BAIL THEM OUT SUCH AS GERMANY WHICH IS CUTTING DOWN FORESTS TO CONVERT TO BIOFUEL TO MEET ITS OWN REDUCTION STANDARDS
WHERE ARE THE NUMBERS HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO SOAK UP THE EMISSIONS WE'LL GENERATE AND HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO THE MONEY THOSE EMISSIONS MAKE
I USED TO USE THESE BAGS FOR GARBAGE NOW I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO BUY GARBAGE BAGS AND THE FIRST THING TO GO IN THE FIRST GARBAGE BAG IS THE BAG THE GARBAGE BAGS COME IN ANOTHER LOSS LOSS FOR THE ENVIROFASCISTS
EVEN AS LATE AS THE PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THE POLLUTION WAS CAUSING GLOBAL COOLING THERE WAS CERTAINLY LOCALIZED POLLUTION LOCAL AIR QUALITY THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZED SO THEY BUILT TALLER SMOKE STACKS THEN ACID RAIN CAME SO THE SCRUBBED THE SUFFER OUT OF THE SMOKE IT TURNS OUT THAT THE SAME SUFFER THAT WAS CAUSING THE ACID RAIN AND POISONING THE AIR AND WATER WAS MASKING THE WARMING EFFECT OF BY REFLECTING SUNLIGHT BACK INTO SPACE

IN SHORT THE EFFECTS OF POLLUTION ARE COMPLEX AND IS A MORE SUBTLE THREAT THAN SOME OTHERS ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN CORRECTED OR MITIGATED AFTER WE CURE THE ISSUES THERE WILL BE OTHER ISSUES THAT COME TO THE FOREFRONT ISN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE MOST URGENT
WE'VE KNOWN FOR WELL OVER A YEARS HERE IS A NEWSPAPER CLIP FROM YES THIS IS REAL
OUR ECONOMY ALMOST LOOKS LIKE IT WAS FOUNDED ON A SCORCHED EARTH POLICY HELL IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA OF ALL TREES WERE DEFORESTED I CAN'T EVEN FATHOM THAT AT ALL
DID PEOPLE NOT REALIZE HOW EXTREMELY THREATENING EMISSIONS WERE BACK WHEN INDUSTRIALIZATION STARTED

OF COURSE NOT

THE INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY AND THUS EMISSIONS FOLLOWS AN EXPONENTIAL CURVE AND HUMANS ARE NOT GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO EXPONENTIAL GROWTH HALF OF ALL HUMAN EMISSIONS EVER HAVE BEEN EMITTED IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS CIRC

IN ADDITION ECONOMIES ARE MOSTLY HUMAN CREATIONS AND THERE'S NO WAY TO FORECAST HUMAN ACTIVITIES BEYOND MONTHS THERE'S A MEMORABLE MEMO FROM LINTON WELLS ABOUT PREDICTING THE FUTURE IT'S A REMINDER HOW FAST THINGS CAN CHANGE

THIS SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND WHEN LOOKING AT THE FIRST SCIENTISTS WHO MENTIONED CLIMATE CHANGE

IN EVANTE ARRHENIUS WAS THE FIRST TO SAY THAT HUMAN INDUSTRY MIGHT LEAD TO GLOBAL WARMING DUE TO HIS WORK ON TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE ICE AGES HE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD THING BECAUSE IT WOULD PREVENT THE NEXT ICE AGE

IN G SOUTH CALENDAR ARGUED THAT THE LEVEL OF CARBON DIOXIDE WAS CLIMBING AND RAISING GLOBAL TEMPERATURE BUT HE ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD THING SINCE IT WOULD PREVENT THE NEXT ICE AGE

NEITHER OF THEM WAS TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY OTHER SCIENTISTS SINCE THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE REABSORBED BY THE OCEANS OR BY PLANTS ON LAND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE THAT SCIENTISTS BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THIS WAS NOT THE CASE

BUT NOBODY BACK THEN WOULD HAVE BE ABLE TO PREDICT HOW FAST HUMAN ECONOMIES CAN GROW UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES
ALMOST EVERYONE THAT HAS DEALT WITH THE WEST COAST CLIMATE HAS ESSENTIALLY SAID IT IS LOST CAUSE THERE THE DROUGHT WILL BECOME CHRONIC WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DECADES RELIEF IS NICE BUT IT IS NOT A LONG TERM SOLUTION

WILL A LARGE POPULATION REMAIN ON IN THE WEST BY THE END OF THE CENTURY WHO KNOWS
REFERENCED FROM R CANADA BY U BADDOGTOO
LOGBOOKS KEPT BY ERNEST SHACKLETON ROBERT SCOTT SHOW ANTARCTIC SEA ICE LEVELS BARELY CHANGED OVER YEARS


I AM A BOTANY I DELETE MY NEGATIVE COMMENTS CONTACT CODE FAQ
MUST BE WHY THE MEDIA NEVER TALKS ABOUT THE ANTARCTIC ANY MORE IT DOESN'T FIT THE DOGMA

JUST A THOUGHT BUT DOESN'T CALIFORNIA ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE LARGEST OIL FIELDS AND ENDLESS ACRES OF MONOCULTURE CROPS
CALIFORNIAN HERE I ALSO DIDN'T READ THE ARTICLE SO I MIGHT BE MISSING SOMETHING BUT BAGS AREN'T PHASED OUT AT ALL THEY JUST COST MONEY NOW

SOME STORES HAVE FREE PAPER ALTERNATIVES TO THE CENT PLASTIC BAGS

EVERYONE I KNOW IS PISSED ABOUT THE CHANGE AND JUST SHELLS OUT WHAT THEY NEED TO TO GET THEIR PLASTIC BAGS

IT'S A STEP BUT IT'S NOT REALLY MUCH IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A PHASE OUT
PLASTIC BAGS ARE ONLY BANNED FROM SUPERMARKETS AND CONVENIENCE STORES I BELIEVE THEY ARE STILL FREE FROM PLACES LIKE OFFICE DEPOT
THUNDERSTORMS AFTER A HOT DAY CAN CAUSE ALLERGIES
TOO MANY TROLLS FORCING POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUB WE NEED TO START DISCUSSING ACTUAL SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE INSTEAD OF GOING IN CIRCULAR DEBATES ABOUT WHICH MAINSTREAM CANDIDATE WAS THE WORST FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THEY ARE BOTH TERRIBLE ANYWAY


SOLUTIONS AND RESEARCH TOPICS INCLUDE

FACTS AND PRESENT EXAMPLES ABOUT WHY RENEWABLE ARE THE BEST ENERGY GENERATION OPTION

STOPPING ALL ENERGY SUBSIDIES RENEWABLE INSTALLATIONS DON'T NEED FUEL OR EXTENSIVE SERVICING TO WORK AND ARE WAY LESS PRONE TO COSTLY ACCIDENTS THEY ALSO DON'T CHARGE THE CONSUMER FOR DECOMMISSION COSTS IF THERE'S ONE SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT CAN GO IT'S RENEWABLE LET'S CALL THEM OUT ON THEIR BLUFF

FUCK THE POLITICIANS WE CAN DO THIS OURSELVES

DO FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO SWAY GOVERNANCE GOVERNMENTS POLICIES

THEY COULD SAY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS REALLY BAD KILL US PLEASE OR AT LEAST TAX US SEVERELY
I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THIS ACTUALLY PLAYS OUT HOW WILL VETERANS RESPOND TO VIOLENT TREATMENT WILL IT ESCALATE BECAUSE OF THEIR PRESENCE

ALSO GOOD ON THEM STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE
MY BROTHER IS HEADING UP TO STANDING ROCK NEXT WEEK HE'S A NAVAJO AND A COMBAT MEDIC THAT WAS DEPLOYED IN IRAQ I WISH I HAD MORE TO SAY THAN THAT I JUST HOPE HE'S SAFE AND I'M IN AWE OF HIM AFTER WHAT HE ALREADY WENT THROUGH IN IRAQ TO DO MORE HERE

THIS IS THE SHIT THAT MAKES AMERICA ACTUALLY GREAT THESE PEOPLE
AS A VET AND ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS PERSON WHERE DO I SIGN UP I'M ONLY A TO THE SOUTHERN
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS PIPELINE VS ALL THE OTHER PIPELINES IN THE US ACCORDING TO THIS MAP THEY ARE VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE ALREADY AND HARDLY EVER GIVEN A THOUGHT
OME I NEED THIS

I NEED TO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR PRINCIPLES AND NOT JUST WHEN IT IS CONVENIENT FOR THEM
CLARK JR MAY NEVER HAVE SERVED IN COMBAT BUT WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT STANDING ROCK HE SOUNDS LIKE A GENERAL THIS ISN T HIS FIRST FORAY INTO ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM HE S CURRENTLY WORKING WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED CLIMATE MOBILIZATION HETP WHICH IS FOCUSED ON BUILDING AND SUPPORTING A SOCIAL MOVEMENT THAT CAUSES THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COMMENCE CLIMATE MOBILIZATION

IN THIS COUNTRY GETTING VETERANS INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF ACTIVISM JUST MIGHT HELP GET US OUT OF OUR CLIMATE MESS
I'D LOVE TO SEE HOW THE FAR RIGHT RESPONDS TO THIS

YOU'RE ALL LIBERAL LAZY GOOD FOR NOTHINGS MEN AND WOMEN FIGHT AND DIE FOR YOU AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY THEM

WE'RE ALL VETS


MOST CIVILIANS WHO VE NEVER SERVED IN A UNIFORM ARE GUTLESS WORMS WHO VE NEVER BEEN IN A FIGHT IN THEIR LIFE WES CLARK JR DECLARES

MOST VETS THAT TALK LIKE THIS ARE GUTLESS WORMS THAT SAID I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR MICHAEL WOOD GLAD HE'S INVOLVED
VETERAN HERE WITH SERIOUS QUESTIONS

HOW IS THE CONSTITUTION BEING VIOLATED

WHO IS THE ENEMY

IS THIS HYPERBOLE
FUCK YEAH AS A VETERAN THIS MAKES ME HAPPY TO HEAR AND IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT I WILL JOIN THE FIGHT THIS SHIT IS BANANAS IT'S TIME THAT WE STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU BUT AMERICANS DON'T ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR VETERANS APART FROM EMPTY GESTURES I DON'T SEE THIS MAKING A BIG DIFFERENCE
DFW YOU'VE GAINED TOO MUCH WEIGHT TO FIT INTO YOUR DRESS GREENS
I AM LEGITIMATELY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS HERE BUT WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL PROS OF BUILDING THIS PIPELINE WHO OWNS IT WHO PROFITS FROM IT AND WHY DOES IT NEED TO BE BUILT
HATE TO SAY THIS BUT I DON'T THINK POLICE IN RIOT GEAR WILL CARE THAT THEY'RE ARMY VETS
I'VE YET TO HEAR THE CONSTITUTIONAL REASONING FOR THESE PROTESTS I'M NOT SAYING I AGREE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT IF SOMEONE COULD EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THIS THE PIPELINE IS A VIOLATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS THAT'D BE GREAT
ALREADY SIGNED UP TO DEPLOY
I'M NEW TO THIS ISSUE BUT AREN'T PIPELINES THE SAFEST WAY TO TRANSPORT OIL LONG DISTANCES WHY IS THIS PIPELINE BAD
FUCK YES

A LITTLE MORE FUCK THAN YES CONSIDERING HOW MUCH FUCK IT TAKES TO GET ME TO SAY YES ABOUT THIS FUCK OF A YES SITUATION

ALL THE MORE RESPECT TO VETS THANK YOU GUYS
THAT LADY WITH THE MANGLED ARM SAD
ELI WHY THE APL IS A BAD THING
AS A COAST GUARD VETERAN HOW CAN I GET INVOLVED IN THIS
I'VE BEEN WONDERING FOR A DECADE IF ANYBODY IN THE MILITARY REMEMBERED THE ACTUAL OATH THEY TOOK
MOST CIVILIANS WHO'VE NEVER SERVED IN A UNIFORM ARE GUTLESS WORMS WHO'VE NEVER BEEN IN A FIGHT IN THEIR LIFE SO IF WE DON'T STOP IT WHO WILL

SAYS THE VET THAT NEVER SERVED IN COMBAT ABOUT WHY VETS SHOULD JOIN A CIVILIAN FIGHT THAT CIVILIANS STARTED
THERE ARE ALREADY FIVE PIPELINES UPSTREAM FROM THE ONE THEY'RE TRYING TO BLOCK ARE THESE PEOPLE SURE THEY EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING
GUESS IT'S A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE THE PROTESTERS ARE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY ARE COMPLETELY UNWILLING TO NEGOTIATE SO ONE COULD REASONABLY ARGUE THEY ARE THE DOMESTIC ENEMY

JUST BECAUSE SOME VETERANS ARE IDEOLOGICALLY ON THE SIDE OF ONE GROUP DOESN'T GIVE ANY MORAL WEIGHT TO THE ARGUMENT ABOUT THE PROTEST


I'VE HEARD SEVERAL DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW ON THIS PIPELINE I CAN EMPATHIZE WITH EACH OF THE OPPOSING SIDES

NO MATTER WHERE YOU STAND ON THE ISSUE YOU CAN NOT BE OKAY WITH THE STATE PROSECUTING REPORTERS AND MILITARIZED POLICE TERRORIZING CIVILIANS
MY PREDICTION IT GOES ABOUT AS WELL AS THE BONUS ARMY ESPECIALLY ONCE TRUMP TAKES OFFICE OFFICIALLY
WELL HOPEFULLY THIS BRINGS MORE ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES NO PROBABLY NOT MAINSTREAM MEDIA DOES NOT CARE ABOUT NUANCES

READING AND LISTENING TO MORE ABOUT THE APL I HAVE LEARNED

THE PROTESTERS PROTECTORS ARE PROTESTING MOSTLY ON PRIVATE PROPERTY AND HAVE DAMAGED PRIVATE PROPERTY TRUCKS CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES AND A FEW HAVE BEHAVED VIOLENTLY OUTSIDE OF THAT

NEVERTHELESS THE POLICE HAVE REACTED TO THE MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTESTS WITH OVERREACTIONS EVEN UNARMED NONVIOLENT PROTESTERS HAVE BEEN HIT WITH WATER CANNONS IN FREEZING TEMPERATURES AS WELL AS TEAR GAS RUBBER BULLETS AND CONCUSSION GRENADES THE POLICE TRIED TO CLAIM THE WATER CANNONS WERE FIRE HOSES USED TO PUT OUT FIRES STARTED BY THE PROTESTORS BUT VIDEO EVIDENCE DISAGREES

ALSO WHILE PIPELINES ARE DEBATABLY SAFER THAN OIL TRAINS USUALLY PIPELINES PRESSURE ALARMS DO NOT GO OFF UNTIL A MORE THAN DROP IN PRESSURE WHILE A SMALL PERCENTAGE PIPELINES CAN MOVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OIL A DAY SO THOUSANDS OF GALLONS COULD LEAK WITHOUT THE OIL COMPANY NOTICING THEY MIGHT PREFER NOT TO NOTICE SINCE SHUTTING DOWN A PIPELINE FOR MAINTENANCE WOULD SERIOUSLY BITE INTO PROFITS

BEYOND THAT LEAKS ARE GENERALLY UNDERREPORTED AND MANY SPILLS ARE IMPROPERLY CLEANED OIL COMPANIES COURT EPA OFFICIALS LIKE LOBBYISTS COURT POLITICIANS SO CORRUPTION IS A REAL WORRY

THE OIL BEING CARRIED TO REFINERIES BY THE APL IS FROM A PARTICULARLY TOXIC SOURCE IT'S BEING MOVED TO REFINERIES DOWN SOUTH PROBABLY BECAUSE CANADA DOESN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT EXPOSURE TO EVEN MINOR LEAKS FROM THE APL AND OTHER PIPELINES COULD HAVE SUCH FUN SIDE EFFECTS AS SEIZURES CANCERS AND BIRTH DEFECTS

AND THE OIL CARRIED BY THE PIPELINES WILL MAKE BUSINESSES AND US STATES VERY LITTLE MONEY SEEING AS THE APL IS CONTROLLED BY APPARENTLY OR CANADIAN FRONTS AND HAS BEEN GRANTED SUBSIDIES AND OR TAX BREAKS IN THE US THE REFINED PRODUCT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY DESTINED TO BE EXPORTED TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES PARTLY BECAUSE THE EXPECTED QUALITY IS TOO LOW FOR THE US TO WANT IT

SO WHETHER THE PROTESTERS HAVE BROKEN ANY LAWS OR NOT I THINK I HAVE TO SIDE WITH THEM AND I HOPE THE VETERAN SUPPORT DOES HELP PIPELINES IN GENERAL AND THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR ARE HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS THAT SHOULD NOT BE ANYWHERE NEAR WATER
PLUS A GROUP OF PEOPLE HAS NO RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE ON A PUBLIC ROADWAY UNLESS THEY HAVE OBTAINED PROPER PERMITTING PRIOR TO THE ACT AS IS THE CASE WITH ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTIONS

PLEASE LISTEN TO YOURSELF DISREGARDING THE PARAGRAPHS OF COLONIAL APOLOGISE YOU'VE SENT ME OVER THE PAST HOURS WHAT YOU'RE ADVOCATING IS THE RIGHT TO PROTEST AS LONG AS IT'S CONVENIENT TO WHOMEVER YOU'RE PROTESTING AGAINST DANGEROUSLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE DECIDED TO COMPLETELY IGNORE MY PRIMARY MESSAGE ADMONISHING THE VIOLENCE AGAINST THE PROTECTORS IN LIEU OF LATCHING ONTO SEMANTICS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THE PROTESTS THE ABUSE OF FORCE PERPETUATED AGAINST THE WATER PROTECTORS A FEW NIGHTS AGO WAS WRONG ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT END OF STORY PLEASE CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF RUBBER BULLETS AND CONCUSSION GRENADES AGAINST UNARMED CIVILIANS IT'S OBVIOUS BY NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO COME TO ANY SEMBLANCE OF UNDERSTANDING
THE PIPELINE IS FAR BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN THE ALTERNATIVES
THIS FILLED MY HEART WITH A LITTLE HOPE FOR US AS A NATION
I WOULD PAY MONEY TO SEE A PAID SECURITY PERSONNEL ATTEMPT TO CORRAL A GROUP OF ARMED WWII VETERANS OFF THEIR PROTEST SPOT
TRUMP MUST BE STOPPED OH WAIT A SECOND NEVER MIND
THAT IS AWESOME
BLESS YOU THIS IS ABHORRENT TREATMENT OF THE CITIZENS OF THE US I CAN'T GO BUT I HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO SEND DONATIONS IT MUST STOP
NOTICE HOW THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS THERE IS ZERO CRITICISM OF OBAMA OR THE GOVERNMENT WATCH HOW QUICKLY THE OPINION CHANGES AND THIS BECOMES THE EVIL PRESIDENT'S GOVERNMENT'S FAULT COME JANUARY
LOVE THIS FUCK YES THANK YOU VETERANS
MODERN ARMY VETS ARE PISSED OFF WITH NO TOLERANCE FOR BULLSHIT I LOVE THEM
THEY ARE GOING TO GET TRAMPLED SINCE THEY ARE GOING UNARMED

VIDEO COMMENT

ROBERT FOLIO KENNEDY JR ON NO BRAINER APL CHOICE THE LAND BELONGS TO THE NATIVE AMERICANS BY TREATY THERE WAS NO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THIS IS A SMALL PROJECT THEY'RE PRETENDING DIFFERENT SECTIONS AREN'T PART OF ONE GIANT PIPELINE WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF THIS PIPELINE
MICHAEL MOORE EXPLAINS WHY TRUMP WILL WIN MICHAEL MOORE AGREES
CHIEF SITTING BULL VS COLONEL NELSON MILES I WAS JUST MAKING A POINT ABOUT HOW SOLDIERS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE ALL OF THE FACTS AND SO WON'T ALWAYS TAKE THE SIDE OF CIVILIANS AS TO THE PROTESTS I COULDN'T REALLY CARE LESS TSH AS TO THE INDIANS WELL
HIRED APL SECURITY OFFICERS VIOLENTLY ATTACK NATIVE AMERICANS WITH DOGS AND PEPPER SPRAY 2 DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE COMPANY ATTACKS NATIVE AMERICAN PROTESTERS WITH DOGS PEPPER SPRAY 2
SHOOTING TO KILL HOW MANY MEN CAN DO THIS IN US HISTORY I WOULDN'T KNOW BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT THERE ARE THOSE CASES OVER AND OVER AGAIN ALL OVER THE WORLD EVEN RECENT HISTORY MENTIONING RECENT BECAUSE OF THIS SHOOTING TO KILL A PERSON IN THE MILITARY DELIBERATELY IS A GELATI
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
IT FRUSTRATES ME THAT THE BUNDY PROTESTERS DON'T COME TO THE NATIVES AID HERE ANYONE KNOW WHY
IT OUR FUCKING INDIANS TOO WTF
THIS WILL BE INTERESTING
I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD AND RESPECTFUL OF ANY MILITARY MAN OR WOMAN WHO GOES THERE TO DEFEND THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTRY THEY SWORE TO PROTECT

I HOPE IT SHOWS HOW SERIOUS THIS SITUATION IS TOO
HOPE THEY CAN HELP I JUST WATCHED THE VIDEO OF A GIRL LOSING HER ARM TO A GRENADE WHILE PROTESTING THINGS ARE GETTING BAD UP THERE
THIS AIN'T WHITE MAN AGAINST RED MANUAL IT'S RICH MAN VS ALL MANKIND A CASTE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY AND VIOLENCE RULE BY THE MINORITY WE LOST R MOUNTAINWISDOM AND FOUND INSTEAD A PERVERTED VERSION OF PROGRESS WHERE SOME GO FORWARD AND LEAVE THE REST BEHIND THE POOR PAY THE RICH MAN'S TAB NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND THIS LIE MUST BE PUT TO REST IF OUR SPECIES WISHES TO EXPLORE STARS WE BETTER LEAVE WAR AND THE IDEA THAT SOME ARE MORE SPECIAL THAN OTHERS BEHIND THE NEEDS OF THE MANY OUTWEIGH THE NEEDS OF THE FEW
WOW COMMENTS IN R ENVIRONMENT WAY TO GO

THE TRIBES HAD TWO YEARS TO VOICE THEIR OPINION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AND ONLY SPOKE UP WHEN THEY DECIDED NOT TO GO THROUGH THEIR LAND I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE WASTING THEIR TIME PRETENDING TO CARE ABOUT THIS WINTER CAN'T GET HERE SOON ENOUGH
DO THESE PEOPLE REALIZE THAT AMERICA IS COVERED WITH OIL PIPELINES THAT CROSS THOUSANDS OF RIVERS AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO SPILL THAN TRAINS AND THAT THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE TRAINS PAID TO START THESE PROTESTS
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN LIVE THERE AND NOT BE STANDING WITH THOSE PEOPLE
I'D LIKE TO SEE ACTIVE MILITARY NATIONAL GUARD OUT THERE TOO
I'VE BEEN WONDERING HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE BEFORE THE GUYS WHO ARE VETS WOULD DO THAT
THE COMPANIES HAD EVERY RIGHT TO PUT A PIPELINE THROUGH THERE GODDAMN IGNORANT PROTESTERS AND NATIVES
BUSINESS AND FIRST FUCK THE PEOPLE AND ENVIRONMENT


HELL YES
DELETED
HOW MANY OF THEM FUCKING TWO LOL
IS THERE A WAY TO DONATE
HAS THE MILITARY EVER DEFIED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY BEFORE

EDIT BY DIRECTLY I MEAN LIKE WHERE DIFFERENT AMERICAN FORCES WERE IN OPPOSITION THE MORE DRAMATIC EXAMPLES I CAN THINK OF ARE LIKE STARTING THE KOREAN WAR BUT THAT WAS DISOBEDIENCE NOT DIRECT CONFLICT

IT WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME I'D KNOWN OF IT HAPPENING IN AMERICA I RECENTLY BECAME FAMILIAR TO THE IDEA SINCE MY FRIEND IS THAI AND APPARENTLY THE MILITARY BEING A LARGELY INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION ALLOWED WITH HAVING ITS OWN POLITICAL LEANINGS IS A BIG REASON WHY THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY COUPS THERE BUT HELL WE COULD REALLY USE A COUP LATELY HAHA NOT HOPING FOR ONE SO MUCH AS WONDERING IF THIS WOULD SET A PRECEDENT FOR THAT BEHAVIOR IN AMERICA
NOW I GUESS WE WATCH HOW THE FOX NEWS RIGHT GETS REAL QUIET WITH THE MILITARY TRIUMPHALISM AT LEAST IF THEY FOLLOW FORM THIS ISN'T COMPLETELY UNPRECEDENTED VETERANS FOR PEACE HAVE BEEN IGNORED BY THE RIGHT FOR YEARS ANOTHER BEFORE THAT
SHOULD READ SOME U SOUTH ARMY VETERANS
GOD DAMNIT IT'S ABOUT TIME I GUESS WE'RE ABOUT READY TO FIND OUT WHO THE REAL CONSTITUENTS OF US GOVERNMENT REALLY ARE THE CORPORATE WORLD OR THE PEOPLE
HEARD LAT NIGHT A WOMAN GOT HER ARM BLOWN OFF BY THE POLICE THROWING CONCUSSION GRENADES AT THEM WTF IS GOING ON IN AMERICA
HOLY SHIT PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN
YEAH WHERE ARE THOSE OATH KEEPER GUYS NOW THEY ONLY SEEM TO GET THEIR HACKLES UP WHEN THE SUBJECT IS THE SECOND AMENDMENT THEY MUST NOT CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT THE FIRST OR THE FOURTH
AFTER ALL THE AMERICAN WAR VETS HAVE BEEN THROUGH FIGHTING AND RISKING THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS OF THE US IMAGINE HOW THEY MUST FEEL SEEING A PRIVATE SECURITY FORCE OPERATING ON THEIR HOME TURF MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY HURTING THE PEOPLE THEY FOUGHT SO HARD TO PROTECT

FUCK THOSE CORPORATE SHILL PRIVATE SECURITY ASSHOLES I SUPPORT THE VETS MUCH RESPECT
EVERY POLICE OFFICER THERE AND FIGHTING AGAINST THE PROTESTORS SHOULD BE FIRED AND MAYBE LOSE THEIR CITIZENSHIP THESE POLICE ARE NOT AMERICAN OR FIGHTING FOR US THEY ARE TRAITORS AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION
HOLY SHIT THIS IS SO STUPID THE PIPELINE ISN'T ON THEIR LAND AND IT IS MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE THAN THE CURRENT TRANSPORTATION METHOD THE OIL IS CURRENTLY BEING MOVED BY TRAIN WHICH IS MUCH MUCH MORE DAMAGING TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAN THE PIPELINE THE FREAKING EPA SAID THE PIPELINE WAS SAFER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THE NEW PIPELINE IS GOING TO BE BUILT UNDER AN EXISTING PIPELINE THERE IS LITERALLY NO DOWNSIDE TO THIS THE PEOPLE PROTESTING AND EVERYONE SUPPORTING THESE PROTESTS IS SIMPLY IGNORANT OF THE TRUE SITUATION
POPULAR CORN
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS SEEN VETERANS AT PROTESTS BEFORE I HAVE A FEELING THEY WILL BE TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER GROUP OF PROTESTERS THESE GUYS DON'T WEAR THE UNIFORM ANYMORE AREN'T ARMED AND THE POLICE DON'T CARE WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN OR CONTRIBUTED
2 VETERANS ARE JOINING THE PROTEST

WATCH OUT GUYS THEY ARE MOBILIZING
DELETED
DONALD TIES TO THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE
GREENPEACE GREENPEACE HETP

TRUMP DISCLOSED BETWEEN AND MILLION IN INVESTMENTS IN THE PRIMARY BUILDER OF THE PIPELINE ENERGY TRANSFER PARTNERS HE ALSO DISCLOSED TO IN INVESTMENTS IN PHILLIPS WHICH WOULD OWN ONE-QUARTER OF THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE ONCE COMPLETED
GO TO AFGHANISTAN TO SECURE A GAS PIPELINE COME HOME AND PREVENT ONE

OBVIOUSLY ONLY THE SMARTEST AMERICANS JOIN THE MILITARY
IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO HAVE A STANDING ARMY WITHIN THE USA DON'T USE THE WORD DEPLOYMENT THE ARMY IS ALSO TASKED WITH DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION BUT YOU CAN'T DEFEND THE THING THAT YOU IGNORE
I LOVE WHEN THE VETERANS SHOW UP TO A PROTEST THEY DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK THEY DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY THINKS THEY JUST DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GET HURT
PROBABLY ALL UNEMPLOYABLE PAPER PUSHERS
JUST AS I SUSPECTED A POG WITH NO COMBAT EXPERIENCE BEATING HIS CHEST ABOUT AN OATH


AND THIS IS HOW CIVIL WARS START

I SAY THIS AS AN INFANTRY VET OF THE A CO 2ND INF REGIMENT WHEN YOU SHOW UP AS A PEACEFUL SHIT ALWAYS GOES SIDEWAYS
DELETED
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS I WANT TO GO
GET OFF PRIVATE LAND NO BODY GIVES A SHIT IF YOU'RE NATIVE AMERICAN GO BACK TO THE STONE AGE YOU IMBECILES AND STOP THWARTING PROGRESS STARTING FIRES AND THROWING SHIT IS NOT A PROTEST YOU CANNOT PROTEST ON PRIVATE PROPERTY I'M PART HAWAIIAN AND I CAN'T GO PROTEST ON MANSION IN HAWAII FUCKING FAGGOTS
OBAMA CAN CALL ANY GROUP OF CITIZENS DOMESTIC TERRORISTS AND THE MILITARY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO KILL THEM
CAN'T SOMEONE THIS SERIOUSLY ELI I'VE READ THAT INDIANS AND ACTIVATES ARE TRYING TO BLOCK THE THING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE BUILD NEEDS SCARED GROUNDS REALLY
LOL SCRUBS
TOO BAD ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL CAN'T GO AND PROTECT THE PROTESTERS IN UNIFORM
FUCK THESE HIPPIES CAN WE JUST BULLDOZE THEM AND BUILD THE PIPELINE ALREADY THAT WOULD BE ENTERTAINING
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT
JUST LET THEM BUILD THE PIPELINE OR ELSE THEY HAVE TO TRUCK IT ALL OVER AND THAT'S WHY MORE POLLUTION
THAT WOULD REQUIRE RELATED COURAGE I APPLAUD VETS WHO DO THIS
THE ENEMIES ARE THE IDIOTS IMPEDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LEGAL US PIPELINE AND THESE VETERANS IF THEY CHOOSE TO BE ON THE IDIOTS SIDE POLICE SHOULD SHOOT ANYONE INTERFERING WITH US ENERGY AS THEY ARE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS
DO YOU GUYS WANT HELL ON EARTH

BECAUSE THAT IS HOW YOU GET HELL ON EARTH


THEY'RE RIOTING ON PRIVATE LAND AND YOUR GREAT CRUSADE WILL ONLY END WITH AGONY AND BLOODSHED LET LAW ENFORCEMENT DO ITS JOB AND STOP FANNING THE FLAMES


BTW I'M A VETERAN TOO DOES THAT GIVE ME EXTRA PERMISSION TO BREAK THE LAW FOR SOME LIBERAL AGENDA TO TURN THINGS INSIDE OUT NO IT DOESN'T

THE WATER SUPPLY WAS SLATED TO SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT SOURCE LONG AGO THIS IS ABOUT GREEDY ASSHOLES WHO ARE LYING TO YOUR FACES AND STOMPING THEIR FEET LIKE BABIES BECAUSE THEY GOT TOO GREEDY AND GOT CUT OUT OF THE DEAL SO NOW THEY'RE MANUFACTURING MULTIPLE BULLSHIT SOB STORIES TO TRY AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THEY'RE BEING OPPRESSED OR SOME SHIT DON'T BE FUCKING DISINGENUOUS TOOLS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE BEING MANIPULATED

TRULY SHAMEFUL
IT'S A DISTRACTION AND UNHELPFUL BY THE TIME WE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO UTILISE IT ON A SCALE SUFFICIENT TO ACTUALLY HELP THE WORLD WILL ALREADY BE DEGREES WARMER THAN IT SHOULD BE IT ALLOWS LAZY THINKING FROM PEOPLE THAT BURY THEIR HEADS IN THE SAND AND JUST ASSUME THAT SCIENCE WILL FIX IT ALL
I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE HELPFUL AT ALL IT WILL BE USED AS AN EXCUSE FOR NOT CONTROLLING OUTPUT OH WE WILL INVENT SOMETHING
VERY BAD IDEA THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO KEEP IT IN THE GROUND FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS WITHOUT LEAKAGE IS A CORROSIVE ACID AND IT USES A LOT OF ENERGY MAKING COAL FIRED POWER PLANTS EVEN LESS COMPATIBLE THAN THEY ALREADY ARE
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY WE HAVE SCREWED THE POOCH ON TRYING TO KEEP EMISSIONS IN CHECK THE DISASTER IS ALREADY ONGOING TO STOP IT WE NEED TO CAPTURE CARBON IF POSSIBLE IN A FORMAT THAT IS MOSTLY CARBON BY WEIGHT ELEMENTAL CARBON WOULD BE THE BEST BUT LIQUID CARBOHYDROGENES WOULD WORK TOO THEN BURY IT THE FUCK BACK

WE STILL NEED EMISSION CONTROLS MORE THAN EVER BUT THAT CAN ONLY BUY US TIME TO SOLVE THE RECAPTURE PROBLEM
CALL YOUR SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVE LET THEM KNOW THAT EARTH SCIENCE AT NASA IS IMPORTANT TO YOU



THE POWER IS YOURS

TRUMP IS VASTLY SUPERIOR TO CLINTON WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY EXXON KOCH BROTHERS CHEVRON ETC DIDN'T DONATE BILLIONS TO CLINTON FOR SHITS AND GIGGLES
FAKE NEWS SEEMS TO BE A THING THESE DAYS ESP ON MIDDLE EAST WARS AND NOW ALSO ON CLIMATE

PEW HAS CATALOGUED AMERICAN VIEWS ON NEWS SERVICES BEING DELIVERED AMERICANS GENERALLY ARE NOT INCLINED TO EMBRACE ALLEGATIONS THEY ARE POLLS SAY UNTRUSTWORTHY

WHO YA GONNA BELIEVE
YET ANOTHER WAY TO SPREAD FAKE NEWS POST IT AS AN OPINION PIECE

AS A NEW PIECE ON FAKE NEWS BY THE POST S OWN EXPLAINS EVERYBODY HAS SHARED SOMETHING BASED ON THE HEADLINE WITHOUT ACTUALLY READING THE LINK

THE GOAL OF MUCH IF NOT MOST FAKE NEWS IS SIMPLY TO SPREAD A FALSE HEADLINE FAR AND WIDE

VASTLY MORE PEOPLE SEE THE HEADLINE OF ANY STORY THAN ACTUALLY READ MUCH OF THE CONTENTION

SO POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE SEEN THE POST S ABSURD HEADLINE TRUMP S CLIMATE PLAN MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD AFTER ALL WITHOUT KNOWING IT COMES FROM AN OPINION PIECE THAT HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN BY A WIDELY DEBUNKED WRITER

THE IGNORANT LEADERS WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD THE EARTH AND ITS HUMANS TO SELF DESTRUCT ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
AREA IS DIRT CHEAP SO EFFICIENCY IS OVERRATED UNLESS IT CAN BE DONE NEARLY FOR FREE UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SATELLITES
THE SUBJECT IS GENERALLY AVOIDED FOR ECONOMIC AND RELIGIOUS REASONS

THE SANCTITY OF LIFE IS BUILT INTO THE PHILOSOPHY OF MOST RELIGIONS NOT IN THE LEAST BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS MOST PEOPLE STAY WITH THE RELIGION THEY WERE BORN INTO

ECONOMICALLY SPEAKING GDP PROJECTED GROWTH RATES AND THE VIABILITY OF RETIREMENT PLANS ARE PREDICATED ON POPULATION GROWTH TAKE FOR EXAMPLE SOCIAL SECURITY WHERE CURRENT WORKERS PAY INTO THE FUND TO COVER RETIRED WORKERS THAT'S A GREAT IDEA WHEN THERE ARE WORKERS FOR EACH RETIRED WORKER BUT IT DOESN'T WORK SO WELL WHEN THERE ARE WORKERS FOR EACH RETIRED WORKER

BUT YOU ARE RIGHT IT IS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED
POPULATION GROWTH IS ALMOST ENTIRELY DUE TO THE CONTINUED REPRESSION OF WOMEN IN POOR COUNTRIES IT SIMPLY ISN'T HAPPENING ANY LONGER IN COUNTRIES WHERE WOMEN HAVE GAINED EDUCATION STATUS AND INDEPENDENCE

THE BEST CURE FOR POPULATION GROWTH ISN'T FOR URBANITES TO FOREGO HAVING ONE CHILD BUT TO EDUCATE UGANDAN GIRLS SO THEY WON'T BE FORCED TO HAVE SIX
IN WEALTHY DEVELOPED POPULATIONS THE POPULATION BIRTH RATE IS BELOW REPLACEMENT SO WE'RE HEADED FOR A LONG TERM DECLINE CONTRACEPTION AND MORE CONTROVERSIALLY ABORTION AND FEMALE EDUCATION AND INTEGRATION INTO THE WORKFORCE IS A HUGE FACTOR HERE IT TURNS OUT REMOVING ACCIDENTAL PREGNANCIES AND GETTING WOMEN OUT OF THE HOME IS ENOUGH ON A SOCIETAL LEVEL FOR A SLIGHT POPULATION DECLINE SO THE SOLUTION HAS ALREADY APPEARED AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE GENOCIDE OR GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS LIKE THE ONE CHILD POLICY IN CHINA

AFRICA IN PARTICULAR IS DUE FOR INCREDIBLE POPULATION GROWTH IN THE NEXT CENTURY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THESE CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENTS THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR BOTH AFRICA AND THE PLANET IS TO ENCOURAGE FEMALE EDUCATION EMPOWERMENT AND CONTRACEPTION THERE
BECAUSE EVOLUTION SELECTS FOR BREEDING MOST OF US ARE MOSTLY BEASTS
THERE'S A LARGE FACTION OF PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEMSELVES INSANELY OUTRAGED OVER HEARING THE SLIGHTEST PEEP ABOUT OVERPOPULATION

THERE'S NOT A LOT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT EXCEPT EDUCATE EVERYONE AND HOPE FOR THE BEST BUT EVEN THEN YOU RISK ALIENATING LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE

FOR EXAMPLE IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE FERTILITY RATE IS ALREADY BELOW REPLACEMENT RATE SO THE WORK OF REDUCING POPULATION HAS ALREADY STARTED YOU CAN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN WHAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING UNLESS YOU START KILLING PEOPLE IN LARGE NUMBERS

CURRENTLY THE HIGHEST FERTILITY RATES ARE IN AFRICA IF YOU AS A WESTERNER START TELLING NIGERIANS THEY NEED TO STOP HAVING CHILDREN PER WOMAN THEY'RE GOING TO SAY YOU'RE A RACIST BENT ON GENOCIDE THEN YOU WON'T GET ANYWHERE WITH WHATEVER OTHER ITEMS ARE ON YOUR AGENDA
BECAUSE LIMITING POPULATION GROWTH MAKES SOME PEOPLE THINK OF EUGENICS
BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL COLLAPSE WILL CAUSE A POPULATION CRASH WHILE BIRTH RATES IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD ARE RAPIDLY DECLINING
AND POLLUTION FROM EUROPE THE US AND AUSTRALIA IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
POLICE ARE NO LONGER HERE TO SERVE AND PROTECT THE PEOPLE THEY ARE HERE TO SERVE AND PROTECT THE COMPANIES THAT PAY THEM
THE ARTICLE IS SADLY ONLY IN SPANISH BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT OVER DUMP TRUCKS LOADED WITH COAL ASH WENT TO UNLOAD THEIR CARGO IN A RURAL COMMUNITY'S DUMP OVER PEOPLE INCLUDING POLITICIANS AND PUERTO RICAN ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OVER THE PRETEXT OF BLOCKING A PUBLIC ROAD FROM WHAT I READ THIS CONTINUOUS ASH DUMP HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR A WHILE NOW AND HAS AFFECTED NEARBY COMMUNITIES GRAVELY
BEING A GARBAGE DUMP IS PROBABLY THEIR HIGHEST BEST USE

THE COMPANY ITSELF PROBABLY NOT MUCH IT WOULD HELP HURT THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS WHO MAY HAVE INFLUENCE ON THE COMPANY THOUGH
THIS ONE IS A BIT TRICKY THE ANSWER TO YOUR LAST QUESTION IS NUMBER SELLING SHARES DOES NOT HURT THE THE ONLY EFFECT YOU CAN HAVE IS TO MOVE THE PRICE DOWN HOWEVER THIS IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AS A SMALL INVESTOR IF BY ANY CHANCE YOU ARE WARREN BUFFET OR GEORGE SOROS THEN A SELLOFF THAT YOU MAKE WILL LIKELY CAUSE THE PRICE TO PLUMMET ANNOYING THE BOARD MEMBERS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY WHO ARE SHAREHOLDERS AS INDIVIDUALS AS WELL IN AN EXTREME CASE A CRASHED PRICE COULD ALSO CAUSE A COMPETITOR TO SWOOP IN AND ACQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL STAKE IN THE COMPANY HOWEVER LIKE I MENTIONED THIS IS AN IMPOSSIBLE SCENARIO FOR AN AVERAGE INVESTOR FOR MORE SEE


NOW FOR YOUR BROADER QUESTION OF SHOULD YOU DIVEST FROM UNETHICAL COMPANIES THE QUESTION IS LESS CLEAR CUT I AM AN ENTHUSIASTIC ENVIRONMENTALIST BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT YOU SHOULDN'T FIRST IF YOU HOLD THESE STOCKS INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INVESTMENT FUND THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF WHAT THE FUND INVESTS IN YOU COULD GO FOR A SO-CALLED ETHICAL OR GREEN FUND BUT OFTEN THESE OPERATE AT VERY HIGH FEES UNDERPERFORM AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HAVE VARYING STANDARDS OF ETHICS FOR EXAMPLE WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO INVEST IN GUN OR TOBACCO COMPANIES HOW ABOUT PALM OIL COMPANIES BIG FISHING COMPANIES OR BIG PHARMA COMPANIES IF YOU CHOOSE TO INVEST ON ETHICAL GROUNDS THEN IT WILL BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A FUND THAT EXACTLY MATCHES YOUR ETHICAL STANDARDS SECOND IF YOU HOLD THE STOCKS DIRECTLY THEN AS I MENTIONED YOUR SELL-OFF WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT ALSO YOU WOULD AGAIN BE FACED WITH DOING CONSTANT DETAILED RESEARCH ON WHAT A COMPANY DOES AND HOW IT MATCHES YOUR STANDARDS AND FINALLY AS A SMALL INVESTOR YOU ACTUALLY DO HAVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF POWER YOU CAN GO TO THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING OR WRITE TO THE INVESTOR RELATIONS DEPARTMENT AND URGE THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING IF YOU SELL MAYBE YOU'LL SELL TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS


AND FINALLY TO SUGGEST SOMETHING DIFFERENT AS A CONSUMER YOU HAVE GREATER INFLUENCE ON A COMPANY THAN AS A SMALL INVESTOR I WOULD LEAVE YOUR INVESTMENTS ALONE AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON REDUCING YOUR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
WALKER HOWEVER CLAIMED THAT DOUBT OVER THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN CLIMATE CHANGE IS A VIEW SHARED BY HALF THE CLIMATOLOGISTS IN THE WORLD WE NEED GOOD SCIENCE TO TELL US WHAT THE REALITY IS AND SCIENCE COULD DO THAT IF POLITICIANS DIDN T INTERFERE WITH IT

AS WELL AS A SPITEFUL ATTEMPT TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THE PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION SITE

THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BE AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE

WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT FIERCELY DEFENDS PROPERTY RIGHTS AGAINST PROTESTERS CLAIMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

THEY DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO BLOCK THE CONSTRUCTION THEY CAN DO LOTS OF THINGS THEY CAN SUE THEY CAN WORK TO CHANGE THE LAW THEY CAN LOBBY THE USAC AND SO ON BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE WITH THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS

IN THE MEANTIME PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD STEP IN TO PROTECT EVERYONE S SAFETY AND PRESSURE THE SHERIFF S OFFICERS TO STAND DOWN

SCEPTICAL SCIENCE EXPLAINS WHY THESE TALKING POINTS ARE FALSE
IT WOULD BE SO WONDERFUL IF WE COULD STOP FUCKING OVER NATIVE AMERICANS
GOD DAMN THAT WEBSITE IS UGLY
I'M NOT SURE OF THE VERACITY OF THIS ARTICLE BUT SURELY THE BIG OIL GIANTS MUST SEE THAT THEY WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND POTENTIALLY LIABLE WHEN CLIMATE CHANGE SHIT REALLY STARTS TO HIT
TRUMP WENT BACK ON SO MANY OF HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES THE WALL MUSLIM BAN LOCK HER UP AND NOW THIS WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE
BUT THIS IS GOOD MAYBE EVEN GREAT NEWS
IT'S THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT NOT DEAL THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BECAUSE DEAL IMPLIES SOMETHING THAT IS BINDING

THE AGREEMENT IS JUST A PROMISE OF COMMITMENT WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS ARE THE POLICIES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ADOPTS THE POINT IS TO MEET EMISSIONS GOALS I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING WITH A PLATFORM OF GUTTING REGULATION AND ON COAL OR WITH MYRON ABELL HEADING THE EPA

THIS IS A FOR TRUMP HE PIVOTS ON AN ISSUE THAT MOST OF AMERICA AGREES WITH AND THUS LOOKS MORE REASONABLE MEANWHILE ACTUAL POLICY WILL BE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION BUT MOST AMERICANS WON'T NOTICE
HERE'S THE THING WHEN POLLED ON INDIVIDUAL ISSUES AMERICAN VOTERS ARE PRETTY OVERWHELMINGLY PROGRESSIVE FOR EXAMPLE SUPPORT MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE FAVOR A FEDERALLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THINK ABORTION SHOULD BE LEGAL AT LEAST IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER KEY ISSUES THAT WHEN POLLED SHOW THAT OVER HALF OF AMERICANS ARE ON THE SIDE OF PROGRESS BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER PEOPLE WILL JUST VOTE FOR WHATEVER PARTY THEY THINK THEY ARE A PART OF THEY WILL JUST VOTE FOR WHOEVER'S NAME THEY RECOGNIZE ON THE BALLOT IT SEEMS LIKE VERY FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY TAKE THE TIME REQUIRED TO RESEARCH A CANDIDATES POSITIONS AND VOTE BASED ON THE ISSUES

SO ALTHOUGH IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE SUPPORT THE PARIS DEAL IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER ALL THAT MUCH
MAYBE OF AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE FUCKING VOTED
HE WAS ELECTED BY A MINORITY THANKS AND IS FILLING HIS CABINET WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS HE CLEARLY DOESN'T CARE WHAT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS THINK
TOO BAD THAT THE ENTIRETY OF THE AGAINST IT VOTED FOR HIM
THAT'S NEARLY THE PERCENTAGE OF THE AMERICAN POPULACE THAT DIDN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP
THE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED FROM JUNE TO AMONG A REPRESENTATIVE NATIONAL SAMPLE OF ADULTS THE MARGIN OF SAMPLING ERROR FOR THE FULL SAMPLE IS INCLUDING A DESIGN EFFECT OF THE MARGIN OF ERROR IS HIGHER FOR PARTISAN SUBGROUPS

PARTISAN IDENTIFICATION IS BASED ON RESPONDENTS ANSWER TO A STANDARD PARTISAN SELF-IDENTIFICATION QUESTION GENERALLY SPEAKING DO YOU USUALLY THINK OF YOURSELF AS A REPUBLICAN A DEMOCRAT AN INDEPENDENT OR WHAT

IN THE SAME PEW SURVEY MODERATE AND ESPECIALLY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS TEND TO THINK THAT THE NEWS MEDIA GENERALLY GIVE TOO LITTLE ATTENTION TO CLIMATE SKEPTICS WHILE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS TEND TO THINK THE MEDIA GIVE SKEPTICS TOO MUCH ATTENTION MODERATE CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS ARE EVENLY DIVIDED

KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME EXPERTS WEIGHTED OPINIONS IN SURVEY
OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS PICKED THIS GUY
SO SHOULD THIS GIVE ME HOPE THAT CONGRESS MIGHT TRY TO BLOCK EFFORTS TO PULL OUT OF THE CLIMATE TREATY
ENJOY YOUR PROTEST VOTE SHIT PEOPLE
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE WRONG THING ABOUT THE PARIS CLIMATE DEAL THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY NOR ENFORCEMENT IN IT COUNTRIES WILL MAKE UP NUMBERS TO MAKE A SHOW THAT THEY ARE MEETING THE AGREEMENT BUT IN REALITY MANMADE GREENHOUSE GASES WILL CONTINUE ITS UPWARD CLIMB ANYBODY WHO THINKS THE PARIS DEAL IS ACTUALLY GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT CARE MORE ABOUT THE POLITICS RATHER THAN THE REALITY
AMERICANS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS IN THE PARIS CLIMATE DEAL OR WHAT IT REALLY MEANS THIS IS JUST SILLY
BEAR IN MIND POLLING RESULTS ARE SKEWED I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT ASKING A HUNDRED OR SO PEOPLE AND THAT'S BEING GENEROUS IS NOT INDICATIVE OF ASKING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

ADD TO THAT THEY COULD HAVE EASILY FOCUSED THEIR POLLING EFFORTS ON DEMOGRAPHICS PROGRESSIVELY LEANING LIBERALS TEND TO FORGET THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER SIDE OF THIS COUNTRY THAT ISN'T DESERVING OF THEIR ATTENTION
DELETED
I WONDER HOW MUCH FURTHER THIS WILL ESCALATE THE PROTESTERS WILL ONLY GET MORE BATTERED AND DESPERATE THE POLICE WILL ONLY GET MORE AND MORE BRUTAL AND THE CORPORATIONS ARE IN FEAR OF LOSING SOME PROFIT FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS

THE MAN'S THE WORST KIND OF OIL INDUSTRY SHILL EMPLOYED BY ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS OIL INDUSTRY FRONT GROUPS

IF TRUMP WAS LOOKING TO MAKE THIS APPOINTMENT A STATEMENT OF CONTEMPT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THIS IS THE GUY
IF THERE'S ONE GUY THAT COULD SELL THE REPUBLICAN BASE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE MEASURES IT WOULD BE HIM
TELL ME THIS IS TRUE
I FIND IT HARD TO PIN HOPES ONTO THIS CONSIDERING TRUMP FLIP FLOPS AND EVEN FLIPS BACK ON THE STUFF HE'S SAID SO FAR PLUS HE STILL WANTS TO APPOINT A DENIER TO THE EPA AND REMOVE REGULATIONS IN FAVOUR OF COAL BETTER TO JUDGE HIM ON THE ACTIONS HE WANTS TO TAKE NOT HIS WORDS
IF ANOTHER OF AMERICANS WOULD HAVE VOTED THEIR OPINION MIGHT MATTER RIGHT NOW
I READ THAT SHE ALREADY HAD HER ARM AMPUTATED
IT'S PROBABLY RELEVANT TO POINT OUT THAT NO ONE IS SURE WHO THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE WAS FROM SOMETHING USED BY POLICE IS UNLIKELY TO CAUSE DAMAGE LIKE THAT THOUGH THE THE PROTESTORS WERE RIGGING UP COULD THOUGH

I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S DEFINITELY WHAT HAPPENED BUT IT SEEMS UNFAIR TO BLAME POLICE WITH NO EVIDENCE THERE ARE PLENTY OF FUCKED UP TACTICS BY THE POLICE WITHOUT UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS

EDIT AGAIN NOT SUPPORTING THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE IN ANY WAY I AM REFERRING SPECIFICALLY TO THE WOMAN LOSING HER ARM I HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE ARTICLES ABOUT POLICE BLOWING A WOMAN'S ARM OFF AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE SUPPORTED BY FACTS

WASHINGTON STATE REPUBLICAN SENATOR DOUG ERICKSEN ANNOUNCED WEDNESDAY PLANS TO INTRODUCE A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW AUTHORITIES TO CHARGE PROTESTERS WITH COMMITTING ECONOMIC TERRORISM

VIOLATORS COULD FACE FIVE YEARS IN PRISON A FINE OR BOTH


WITH THE UPCOMING SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENT S WE COULD REALISTICALLY SEE A COMPLETE LOSS OF THE RIGHT TO PROTEST IN REPUBLICAN RUN STATES

REMEMBER FOLKS THESE AREN'T PROTESTERS NOW THEY ARE ECONOMIC TERRORISTS
I THINK THIS IS IN THE WRONG SUBREDDIT FOR THIS ARTICLE BUT I'M GAME THEY ARE NOT EMBOLDENED BY WIN THEY ARE EMBOLDENED BY WINNING THE GOVERNORS AND STATE LEGISLATURES ALTHOUGH TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A MANDATE IT COULD ARGUABLY BE SAID THAT THE PEOPLE GAVE THE STATES A MANDATE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE

THE DEMOCRATS REALLY SHOULD BE ASKING THEMSELVES HOW THEY MESSED IT UP SO BADLY WITHIN EIGHT YEARS OF OWNING BOTH THE PRESIDENCY SENATE AND HOUSE AND STATE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE GOVERNMENTS TO GO TO THE POLAR OPPOSITE

EVEN THE POINT OF THE POPULAR ELECTION BEING WON BY CLINTON ONLY MEANS THAT THOSE WHO BOTHERED TO VOTE FOR CLINTON MOSTLY LIVED IN BUBBLES ON THE COASTS THE PEOPLE WHO USED TO VOTE DEMOCRAT IN THE FLYOVER NATION DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO GO TO THE POLLS OR SWITCHED OVER TO THE REPUBLICANS

INSTEAD OF TALKING IN THEIR ECHO CHAMBERS DEMOCRATS HAVE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE IN BETWEEN THE COASTS AND OUTSIDE THE CITIES INSTEAD OF DENIGRATING AND DEMONIZING THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A VOTE AND IF DEMOCRATS WON'T LISTEN TO THEM AT BEST THEY WILL STAY HOME INSTEAD OF VOTING AND AT WORST THEY WILL VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO WILLIAM

COOL BUT IT DOESN'T HELP THE DEFORESTATION ASPECT REALLY ANYONE THAT CARES ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD SHOULD STOP EATING MEAT AND DAIRY ALTOGETHER
NOW THAT WE KNOW THIS WHY DO WE NOT ACT ON IT IF WE PUT A PRICE ON METHANE EMISSIONS FROM MEAT PRODUCTION MOST WOULD ADD THIS TO THE FEED TO AVOID PAYING IT
HOPEFULLY NOW WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE MECHANISM AND FIND A GRASS THAT HAS THE SAME EFFECT OR BETTER
THIS IS SUPER COOL BUT THIS IS ONLY REALLY FEASIBLE ON FEEDLOT OPERATIONS WHERE YOU CAN MIX THE SEAWEED INTO CATTLE FEED VERY DIFFICULT TO SPREAD THE SEAWEED ON PASTURE OPERATIONS WHERE MORE METHANE IS PRODUCED DUE TO FEED OPERATIONS
NOW THEY ONLY HAVE TO START GROWING VERY LARGE QUANTITIES OF SEAWEED I CAN'T SEE HOW THIS WILL EVER HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MARINE LIFE
WOW WHY DON'T WE JUST FEED THE COWS GRASS LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO
THE REGIONAL COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP CEP A POTENTIAL DEAL IT CHINA HAS LONG CHAMPIONED THAT INVOLVES ASIAN NATIONS PLUS AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND
THE CEP WOULD INVOLVE MUCH LOWER STANDARDS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT LABOR RIGHTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION THAN THE APP

THIS THIS IS WHERE THE PROMISE OF GLOBALIZATION HAS REALLY FAILED HUMANITY WHEN GLOBALIZED TRADE WAS FIRST BEING SOLD IT PROMISED TO BRING UP THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS OF LAGGARD NATIONS WE WERE TOLD THAT COUNTRIES THAT DIDN'T CONFORM TO THE HIGHER STANDARDS WOULD BE ON THE OUT OF TRADE DEALS THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF ITS BIGGEST LIES BECAUSE TRADE AGREEMENTS SEEM TO BE THE CATALYST FOR A RACE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL BOTTOM
RESULTS OF SIMULATION MODELS SHOW THAT REMOVING TREES IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA CAUSES COOLING IN SIBERIA WHICH SLOWS FOREST GROWTH THERE TREE LOSS IN THE WESTERN U SOUTH ALSO MAKES AIR DRIER IN THE SOUTHEASTERN U SOUTH WHICH HARMS FORESTS IN PLACES LIKE THE CAROLINAS BUT FORESTS IN SOUTH AMERICA ACTUALLY BENEFIT BECAUSE IT BECOMES COOLER AND THUS WETTER SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR

IN THE SECOND TEST CASE REMOVING MOST OF THE AMAZON RAINFOREST ALSO CAUSED SIBERIA TO BECOME COLDER AND MORE BARREN BUT IT HAD A SLIGHT POSITIVE IMPACT ON SOUTHEASTERN U SOUTH VEGETATION LOSING AMAZON FOREST HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORING FORESTS IN EASTERN SOUTH AMERICA MOSTLY BY INCREASING THE PRECIPITATION THERE DURING THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SUMMER

I CAN EXPLAIN THE DENIAL SINCE I AM NOW CONFRONTING MY HUSBAND'S IT IS VERY STRONG BECAUSE PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO THINK THEIR LIVES AND EVERYTHING THEY ARE BUILDING AMOUNTS TO NOTHING I JUST WOKE UP TO THIS LAST WEEK AND I HAVE BEEN SPENDING MY TIME IN UTTER DESPAIR BECAUSE MY KIDS WILL NOT HAVE A HABITABLE PLANET

I JUST GOT TO WORK IT'S ALL COMPLETELY POINTLESS NOW MY HOPES AND DREAMS WILL BE COMPLETELY DEAD IN THE WATER MY KIDS WILL NOT HAVE KIDS AND NOBODY BELIEVES IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T YET LOOK LIKE THE WORLD IS BURNING

MY HUSBAND WANTS TO HAVE ME COMMITTED BECAUSE I AM FLIPPING OUT BECAUSE OF THE NEWS ABOUT SEA ICE BUT THIS IS IT PEOPLE THE DOMINOES HAVE BEEN SET UP AND THEY HAVE BEEN FALLING FOR SOME TIME NOW


IM GOING TO START PLANTING TREES WHERE EVER I CAN
WELL IT'S PROBABLY ALREADY GAME OVER THERE APPEARS TO BE NO IFS LEFT

PDWFWEI
THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS WHY I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO HAVE KIDS THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND I DON'T WANT MY KIDS GROWING UP IN A SCREWED UP CLIMATE I WOULD RATHER ADOPT A CHILD WHO ALREADY EXISTS
IT'S PROBABLY TOO LATE TO CHANGE COURSE IT'S TIME TO PANIC
A PANDEMIC OR TWO WOULD HELP
AM I WRONG TO HOPE FOR A NEW PLAGUE
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD PUT OFF HAVING KIDS DON'T START PUMPING THEM OUT WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG IDEALLY WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE ALSO LIMIT YOURSELF TO ONE CHILD ONLY

TO NOTE I HAD ONE CHILD WHEN I WAS THEN HAD MY TUBES TIED

ONE CHILD IS GROWTH FOR THE TIME BEING BECAUSE BOTH PARENTS ARE TYPICALLY STILL ALIVE SO 2 A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OUR KIDS REPLACE US BUT THAT IS FALSE WE USED TO DIE A LOT YOUNGER THAN WE DO NOW OUR KIDS ARE NOT REPLACING US THEY ARE ADDED NUMBERS AND CHANCES ARE THEY WILL HAVE KIDS AND POSSIBLY EVEN GRANDKIDS BEFORE WE DIE ALL OF THIS IS THE PROBLEM
TOO LATE UNLESS WE START BRINGING BACK THE EXTINCT ONES

WE'RE FEELING THE EFFECTS OF THE FIRST WAVE OF EXTINCTIONS WE CAUSED AND IT'S SNOWBALLING
WE HAVE TO POST THESE THINGS TO WORLDNEWS NOT JUST ENVIRONMENT
HERE'S TO HOPING HE'LL TAKE CLIMATE CHANGE MORE SERIOUSLY ANYHOW IF NOT HIS EGO ASSETS WEALTH WILL MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND BY THEN IT WILL BE MUCH TOO LATE KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT
WELL I SIGNED IT LET'S HOPE ALL OF THESE MESSAGES WILL HAVE SOME LASTING EFFECTS
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME CITIZEN VOICES WILL MEAN EVEN LESS IN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION NOT THAT THE OLD ONES LISTENED TO US
YOUR QUESTION DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WE CAN'T DESCRIBE AN ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT INCLUDING ITS NUTRIENT CYCLES OF WHICH FOOD CHAINS ARE A PART

YES LOSS OF KRILL FOR EXAMPLE HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON THE SOUTHERN OCEAN LOSS OF A TOP PREDATOR CAN COMPLETELY DESTABILIZE AN ECOSYSTEM
IT'S A MISREPRESENTATION INDUSTRY CREATED CLIMATE CHANGE CHINA HAS INDUSTRY THEREFORE IT'S CHINA
FAKE CONSPIRACY THEORIES NEED SCAPEGOATS WHO WOULD SEEM TO BENEFIT FROM SAID THEORY

PROBLEM IS CHINA HAS NO EPA AND HAS BEEN TAKING MANUFACTURING FROM THE USA FOR QUITE A LONG TIME IF ANYTHING GLOBAL ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE EMISSIONS LIMITS WOULD HELP PUT AMERICA ON MORE EVEN FOOTING WITH VIRTUALLY UNREGULATED CHINESE INDUSTRY

IF CLIMATE CHANGE SOLUTIONS ARE ONLY IMPLEMENTED IN THE USA THEN ITS POSSIBLE THAT THE CHINESE WOULD BENEFIT MORE IN THE SHORT TERM ASSUMING THERE'S ANY JOBS LEFT FOR US TO LOSE TO THEM HOWEVER CONSIDERING THE PROBLEMS WITH AIR POLLUTION THAT CHINA HAS BEEN FACING AND THEIR OF SOLAR PANEL MANUFACTURING IT SEEMS THAT CHINA IS ADDRESSING IT'S ISSUES MORE SERIOUSLY THAN WE ARE AND ARE LIKELY TO REAP LONG-TERM BENEFITS OF ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND IMPROVED AIR QUALITY
SURELY THERE'S A QUICK TECHNICAL FIX TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS WHICH WAS CAUSED BY OUR RELIANCE ON QUICK TECHNICAL FIXES HEY I HAVE A SOLUTION TO RISING EMISSIONS BURN LESS FUCKING FOSSIL FUEL GUARANTEED EFFECTIVE
NOT VERY EFFICIENT HOPEFULLY IT GIVES WAY TO SOMETHING BETTER
THIS IS ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST REASON WHY WE NEED CULTURED MEAT ALONG WITH ANIMAL FELLFARE AND METHANE REDUCTION OF COURSE BUT DEFORESTATION IS A MOTHERFUCKER ON ITS OWN

UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS A DANGEROUS MENTALITY TRUMP HAS THE POWER TO PUT PEOPLE INTO POSITIONS THAT CAN DO EVERYTHING BAD WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT
THE BAD NEWS IS SO DOES EVERYONE WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL A LARGE SCALE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OF EPIC PROPORTIONS MAYBE HELPS REDUCE OUTPUTS ENOUGH TO AVOID CATASTROPHIC RUNAWAY CONDITIONS WHICH MIGHT ALREADY BE HERE

I WEEP FOR OUR FUTURE OUR PLANET IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE INHABITABLE AFTER MY GENERATIONS I GAVE BIRTH TO DEAD KIDS
WELL FIRST OF ALL WHAT ARE HIS ARGUMENTS WHY DOES HE NOT BELIEVE IN IT THERE MIGHT BE SEVERAL WAYS TO CONVINCE HIM FIRST OF ALL YOU MAY SHOW HIM THE ARTICLES OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT MIGHT DESERVE CREDIBILITY LIKE NASA FOR INSTANCE OR THAT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE MOST SCIENTISTS OVER SOME SAY OR MORE I DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT FIGURES DO AGREE CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL IF HE HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION THEN SHOW YOU ARE OPEN TO HEAR IT AND LET HIM SHOW HIS EVIDENCE I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE HE WILL BE ABLE TO INDICATE SOME SOLID ARTICLES ABOUT IT AND INDEPENDENT EXPERT OPINIONS OF EXPERTS BUT MAYBE HE WILL I AM CURIOUS ABOUT IT TOO SO LET'S SEE WHAT HE BRINGS
TO HIM I GUESS IT IS A HOAX AND A GLOBAL CONSPIRACY VERY WELL THEN LET'S JUST THINK IN TERMS OF STRATEGY WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN AFFIRMING IT'S A HOAX STRANGELY MANY CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS ARE SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN THE OIL BUSINESS IT MAY BE THAT THEY TRULY BELIEVE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX BUT THEIR PSYCHOLOGY DOES HAVE A VERY SOLID REASON TO SOME FACTS WELL LOOK IT WAS ACTUALLY QUITE COLD THIS YEAR AND IT SNOWED HERE AND THERE AND THE OCEAN DID NOT RISE THAT MUCH IN ORDER TO HAVE THE INNER CONFIRMATION OF THEIR THEORY
THEN IF THE VOICE OF REASON DOES NOT WORK MAYBE HE HAS REASONS TO DENY IT ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL I REALLY DO NOT KNOW YOUR FATHER BUT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE IS ENJOYING HIS LIFESTYLE AND HE DOES NOT WANT HIM OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THIS MATTER TO CHANGE IS HE DRIVING A HIGHLY POLLUTING CAR IS HE EATING A LOT OF MEAT WHAT IF IT JUST DOES NOT APPEAL TO HIM TO BELIEVE IN IT WHAT IF HE DENIES IT FOR REASONS THAT ARE NOT REASONABLE IN THIS CASE MAYBE YOU NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT STANDS BEHIND HIS STUBBORNNESS AGAIN I DO NOT KNOW HIM AT ALL AND THIS IS ALL PURE GUESSING MY POINT IS THAT IN THAT CASE YOU MAY BE MORE SUCCESSFUL NOT PUSHING ON CLIMATE CHANGE BUT SHOWING THAT THE GREEN WAY CAN ACTUALLY BE ECONOMICALLY LUCRATIVE AND BRING BENEFITS RELATED TO HEALTH HE IS NOT DENYING THE TOXICITY OF THE EXHAUST GAS AND ITS INFLUENCE ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH TOO IS HE PLUS LOOK EVEN IF CLIMATE CHANGE WERE NOT TRUE OIL AND COAL WILL NOT LAST FOR TOO LONG MAYBE TURNING THE COUNTRY'S INVESTMENTS TO SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY WILL GUARANTEE AND SMOOTH TRANSITION IN A WORLD THAT WILL NEED TO MOVE TO THOSE SOONER OR LATER
I AM WRITING ALL OF THESE BUT TO BE HONEST I HAVE ALSO MET VERY SKEPTICAL PEOPLE CALLING ALL OF IT A HOAX I INVITED THEM TO BRING SOLID EVIDENCE AND THEY COULDN'T PREFERRING TO JUST CLOSE THE SUBJECT SO I DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE YOUR ENDEAVOR MIGHT BE KEEP ME POSTED I AM CURIOUS
BORROW A PAGE OR TWO FROM GEORGE LAYOFF AND TRY TO REFRAME IT


NOT SURE WHERE YOUR FATHER STANDS AS REGARDS POLITICS AND RELIGION BUT A SAFE BET MAY BE TO REPHRASE THINGS IN A WAY SO AS TO MAKE CARING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AN ACT OF STEWARDSHIP THE SORT OF THING A STRONG FATHER DOES TO PROTECT HIS CHILDREN


KEEP IT SMALL KEEP IT PERSONAL


AVOID THE WORD GLOBAL IF AT ALL POSSIBLE


PULL HISTORICAL WEATHER DATA FOR WHERE YOU CURRENTLY LIVE PLUS ANY REGIONS HE PERSONALLY CARES ABOUT


DON'T GO TOO FAR BACK HIS LIFETIME PLUS THAT OF HIS PARENTS SHOULD JUST ABOUT FIT
HOW OLD ARE YOU WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT THAT YOUR FATHER AGREE WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE FATHERS ARE NOT PERFECT CHILDREN ARE NOT PERFECT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THIS IN ONE SETDOWN WITH AN ARMLOAD OF BOOKS GIVE YOUR DAD A BREAK LET SOMEONE ELSE CONVINCE HIM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATHERS AND THEIR CHILDREN IS COMPLEX ENOUGH WITHOUT TURNING IT INTO A SEMINAR
IS THERE A REASON HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IT
GO IN THIS ORDER
DEBATE HIM ON WHETHER THESE ARE TRUE OR FALSE


DOES HE BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF


DOES HE BELIEVE IN ABILITY TO TRAP HEAT

OPTIONAL DOES HE BELIEVE CAN TRAP HEAT FOR YEARS



DOES HE BELIEVE THERE IS A HEAT BALANCE THAT CREATURES ARE USED TO



DOES HE BELIEVE DESTROYING THE OLD ORDER WON'T WIPE OUT SPECIES AND DESTROY LARGE CHUNKS OF ENVIRONMENT
ASK HIM IF ANY INFORMATION YOU COULD PROVIDE WOULD CHANGE HIS MIND IF NOT DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME

MOST PEOPLE ARE UNWILLING TO CHANGE THEIR BELIEFS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IF HE ISN'T ONE OF THOSE THEN SEE THE OTHER POSTS HERE

MYSTERIOUS WINDS CAUSE RAPID MELTING OF ANTARCTIC ICE
SCIENTISTS SUSPECT WARM FOHN WINDS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CALVING ICE SHELVES AND WHEN THEY OCCUR IS SURPRISING

WE'RE SO FUCKED
MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVERYTHING IS FINE SOCIETY MAKES SENSE BUY LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS THIS HOLIDAY SEASON
IN THE FUTURE REMEMBER THAT YOU HEARD IT FROM ME FIRST THE GULF STREAM IS NOW COMING TO A STOP

THE WARM WATER THAT USUALLY IS CHILLED ENOUGH TO SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND BE FLUSHED BACK TO THE MEXICAN GULF TO BE WARMED UP AGAIN IS NOW GATHERING AROUND THE NORTH POLE INSTEAD IT WILL BE A NUMBER OF WARM YEARS UNTIL THE ENTIRE GULF STREAM COMES TO A COMPLETE STOP THEN IT WILL BE COOLED WINTER IS COMING

YOU SHOULD VISIT ICELAND AND THE NORDIC WHILE IT'S STILL NICE THERE IN THE SUMMERS
CHICAGO IN NOVEMBER CHECKING IN WAS DEGREES THREE TIMES IN THE PAST WEEK
CAN CONFIRM LIVE IN PRAIRIES IT SHOULD BE SNOW AND FREEZING AND IT WAS C C THE PAST WEEK OR SO GETTING COLDER NOW WONDER IF THE ARCTIC WILL CATCH UP
THIS IS WHY FOCUSING ON THE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD BE NUMBER OVER MOST ISSUES AND SADLY ITS PUSHED ASIDE FOR EXAMPLE NOT ONCE WAS THERE TALK DURING THE U SOUTH PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
DEGREES WHAT FFS THIS SAME TITLE HAS BEEN POSTED HALF A DOZEN TIMES NOW AND STILL NO POSTER CAN BE EVEN SLIGHTLY BOTHERED TO RECOGNISE THERE IS A WORLD OUTSIDE THE US
THE PRESENT ENERGY ECONOMY IN THE US IS DRIVEN BY THE LOW PRICE OF NATURAL GAS AND RENEWABLE AND TRUMP IS UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THAT THE SUBSIDIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY HELPING RENEWABLE WERE POPULAR ENOUGH IN CONGRESS TO BE ONE OF THE FEW THINGS PASSED DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THE TRAJECTORY OF RENEWABLE PRICES IS SUCH THAT THE SUBSIDIES WON'T BE NEEDED FOR COST COMPETITIVENESS FOR MUCH LONGER WHILE TRUMP MAY REVOKE SOME OF THE RULES THAT MAKE COAL LESS COMPETITIVE IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT BUSINESSES WILL FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT THESE CHANGES WILL SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE A COAL PLANT WITH A LIFESPAN THAT RUNS DECADES A REASONABLE RISK
FUCK
SO THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT WILL NOT SELL TO SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T INTEND TO DEVELOP THE LAND I EAST HYDRAULIC FRACTURING IS IT JUST ME OR IS EVERYONE FEELING LIKE WE ARE TOTALLY SCREWED
THIS MIGHT HELP

TEXAS MINIMUM PRODUCTION QUANTITIES TO KEEP THE WELL CLASSIFIED AS ACTIVE

PRICKS
THE SMART TILES WILL COST LESS THAN STUFF LIKE TERRA-COTTA TILES NOT REGULAR ASPHALT SHINGLES
I JUST REPLACED MY ROOF WITH A YEAR ONE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO
THEY'LL GET CHEAPER AS THEY GET ADOPTED JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE OTHER COMPANIES WILL START MAKING THEIR OWN VERSIONS COMPETITION WILL KICK IN YADDA YADDA THIS IS SUPER COOL AND DEFINITELY THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO GO IN
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE US TO JUMP BEHIND MUSK AND THE SOLAR POWER INDUSTRY MAKES EVERYTHING CHEAPER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE
WE DON'T DO SHINGLES IN AUSTRALIA WE DO HAVE TILES

TO BE HONEST I THINK MY SOLAR PANELS HELP KEEP THE HOUSE COOL THEY ARE A FEW CM OFF THE ROOF AND PROVIDE SHADE AND ALLOW FOR AIR FLOW BETWEEN THE PANEL AND ROOF
THE ONLY QUESTION I'VE EVER HAD ABOUT THESE OR REGULAR SOLAR PANELS IS ABOUT HAIL DAMAGE I LIVE IN NORTH TEXAS AND SEVERAL TIMES WE'VE HAD HAIL THE SIZE OF GOLF BALLS OR BIGGER WE HAD TO HAVE OUR SHINGLE ROOF REPLACED BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED
I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I CAN BUY IT AT HOME DEPOT
BUT WHO WILL PROTECT THE PROFITS OF DUMB ROOF MANUFACTURERS S
IN AUSTRALIA TILED ROOFS ARE THE NORM I'VE NEVER SEEN ASPHALT SHINGLES HERE WE DO HAVE CORRUGATED COLOURBOND AS CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES BUT THESE ARE MOSTLY USED IN RURAL CONSTRUCTION PRETTY MUCH EVERY SUBURBAN HOUSE IS A TILED ROOF
A NEAT FEATURE FOR NEW ROOFS IS POSSIBLY NOT HAVING TO ENGINEER FOR SNOW LOADS

IS A HEATING FEATURE SOMETHING THAT IS PART OF THE INVERTER THAT JUST SENDS A REVERSE CURRENT TO THE CELLS OR IS IT MORE INVOLVED THAN THAT

WOULD YOU STILL HAVE TO ENGINEER FOR SNOWLANDS BASED ON THE CELLS HEATER FAILING
DIDN'T HE SAY WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ELECTRICITY THEN IT'S CHEAPER

AKA NOT CHEAPER AT ALL

OR DID HE MEAN WHEN YOU COMPARE A REGULAR ROOF WITH SOLAR PANELS ITS CHEAPER THAN THAT

I THINK HE TALKS A LOT OF SHIT
NO NEED TO GET CHEEKY ABOUT IT BLOKE
IS NOBODY GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MINI TESLA AT IN THE VIDEO
YEAH YEAH BUT WHAT'S THE COST IN DOLLAR AMOUNT I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT A DUMB ROOF WOULD COST SO THAT REFERENCE POINT DOESN'T HELP ME
YOU DON'T SEE TOO MANY ELECTRICIANS THROWING ON ASPHALT SHINGLES I FIND IT PRETTY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT FANCY SOLAR ROOF PANELS ARE CHEAPER THAN ASPHALT SHINGLES I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE ENERGY SAVINGS AND POTENTIAL LONG TERM VALUE BUT THE UPFRONT COST FOR RETROFITTING A ROOF AND INSTALLATION HAS TO BE PRETTY HIGH
I'M A HUGE ENVIRONMENTALIST AND THIS IS DEFINITELY A STEP FORWARD IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WOULD BE GREAT IF THAT DEADLINE IS MET CONSIDERING HIS SOMEWHAT UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT SO FAR AT HAVING A COMMERCIAL SPACESHIP
DUDE THE FAM JUST BOUGHT A NEW ROOF
AFTER YOU FIGURE IN COST OF ELECTRICITY OVER ITS LIFETIME THAT MEANS THE INITIAL INVESTMENT COULD BE VERY CONSIDERABLE
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF SOLAR AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES WON'T WORK FOR APARTMENT OR MULTI DWELLINGS ALAS
ONCE SUBSIDIES FOR SOLAR ARE STRIPPED OUT NO ONE OTHER THAN THAN THE TOP OF THE TOP CAN AFFORD THIS STUFF ALL GREEN FANTASIES WE NEED NEW TECH NOT OLD TECH
ELECTRICITY AND HYDROGEN POWER BOTH HAVE USAGE CASES WHERE THEY EXCEL ALSO BOTH ARE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH ARE SEEING INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME

THE REAL REASON THAT ELECTRICAL VEHICLES HAVE OUTPACED HYDROGEN VEHICLES IS THAT THE PACE OF BATTERY DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN ACCELERATED BY SEVERAL INDUSTRIES FROM CONSUMER PRODUCTS TO RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION AVIONICS MILITARY AND OTHER APPLICATIONS

HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS ALSO HAVE A FEW DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS BUT SO FAR THEIR BEST USAGE CASE HAS BEEN SPACE FLIGHT THERE AREN'T AS MANY CONSUMER APPLICATIONS FOR POWER GENERATION AS THERE ARE FOR POWER STORAGE

IF THERE WERE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CATALYSTS FOR THE WATER HYDROGEN PROCESS AS WELL AS MASSIVELY LOWER ENERGY COSTS FOR WATER DESALINIZATION HYDROGEN POWER COULD BE AS WIDELY SUCCESSFUL AS TRADITIONAL PETROLEUM VEHICLES UNLIKE PETROLEUM HYDROGEN CAN BE GENERATED VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE LEADING TO DECENTRALIZED GAS STATIONS HYDROGEN REAL GAS OR HYDROGEN GENERATION AT HOME ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT AS ENERGY DENSE AS HYDROCARBON FUELS IT'S STILL BETTER THAN THE MILE RANGE OF CURRENT GEN DEVS IT ALSO DOESN'T ADD AS MUCH COST OR WEIGHT TO VEHICLES COMPARED TO CURRENT BATTERIES

SO RATHER THAN DISMISS A TECHNOLOGY THAT HASN'T YET DEVELOPED FULLY LET'S ACCEPT THAT FOR NOW HYDROGEN GENERATION ISN'T EFFICIENT ENOUGH CHEAP ENOUGH OR SMALL ENOUGH TO DISRUPT THE TRADITIONAL VEHICLE MARKET THESE ARE THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT MADE PURE DEVS RATHER IMPOSSIBLE WHEN THE PRIUS WAS FIRST RELEASED IN ANOTHER DECADE FROM NOW WHO KNOWS WHAT TECHNOLOGIES WILL HAVE FROM NICHE APPLICATIONS AND RESEARCH LABS TO MATURE APPLICATIONS
I'M OKAY WITH THIS THE ABILITY TO FUEL MY CAR AT HOME IS A HUUUUGE PART OF WHY I WANT AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE I'M STUCK WITH A PRIUS NOW BUT A BOLT OR MODEL OR SOME OTHER EV IS IN MY FUTURE
THIS ARTICLE SEEMS RATHER MISLEADING

THERE ARE ABOUT MILLION ACRES OF TREES SPREAD ACROSS CALIFORNIA S NATIONAL FORESTS AND THE LATEST FIGURES SHOW MILLION OF THEM MORE THAN ONE-THIRD ARE DEAD

IT SEEMS LIKE THEY TOOK THE FIGURE FROM A SURVEY OF THE ENTIRE STATE AND APPLIED IT TO THE NATIONAL FORESTS

HERE'S WHAT I FOUND ON IT

NEWS RELEASES


GLOBAL WARMING AND THE EVER DWINDLING SUPPLY OF GROUND AND AQUIFER WATER THAT IS TURNING THE SOIL INTO NOT CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING TREES OR MOST BENEFICIAL VEGETATION
INCREDIBLY SAD NONETHELESS
THEY USE THE DEAD TREES FOR THEIR BIOMASS BURNING POWER PLANTS WHICH IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT CALIFORNIA CROWS ABOUT
THEY BE SMOKING THEM TREES OVER IN CALIFORNIA
DON'T FORGET THAT THE CUYAHOGA RIVER IN OHIO ACTUALLY CAUGHT FIRE
ITEMS SHOW

AS MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY THIS AND HOPE IT ISN'T TRUE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A MAJOR DISASTER LIKE THIS DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF THINGS TAKING A TURN FOR THE BETTER
WE'RE IN FOR A BUMPY RIDE WAIT TILL ALL THE FAKE NEWS SITES START SUPPORTING THE NEW AGENDA
IT EXISTS NOW AND WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS
WIKI THOUSANDS KILLED AND TENS OF THOUSANDS MADE SICK
BUT ACCORDING TO HIS SUPPORTERS AND THOSE WHO VOTED AGAINST HILLARY INSTEAD OF TRUMP AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE GIMME A BREAK
WHY DO PEOPLE THINK HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND IT HE KNOWS IT'S REAL AND HOW IT WORKS HE JUST MAKES SOUNDS COME OUT OF HIS WORD HOLE THAT GET PEOPLE TO GIVE HIM THINGS AND DO THINGS FOR HIM HE THINKS IT'S GREAT THAT HE CAN DO THAT HE'S BEEN DOING IT FOREVER HE DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING OR ANYONE AND LIES THE SAME WAY YOU BREATHE
FORGET THAT JUST GET MUSK TO SHOW HIM HOW MUCH BETTER NEW ENERGY IS AS A BUSINESS TALK TO HIM USING NUMBERS HE CARES ABOUT JOBS GROWTH DOLLARS
WHY NOT BILL MCKIBBEN OR BILL NYE
THIS ARTICLE IS FROM OCTOBER CATANZARO HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE TRANSITION TEAM
SIGH
IS THERE A RELIABLE WAY TO SEE IF SOMEONE HAS A SOUL I DEMAND A TEST FOR THIS GUY CAN'T IMAGINE DOING WHAT HE IS DOING AT THIS POINT IN OUR STORY
MAKES ME SAD TO LEARN THIS
LOL
HILLARY HELPED SPREAD BRACKING AND THAT WASN'T A BIG DEAL IN FACT PEOPLE WERE PRAISING HER FOR IT AS THE ELECTION GOT CLOSER

SO BRACKING IS STILL PERFECTLY FINE UNDER TRUMP RIGHT
BAS CARROLL MOFFETT PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IN WASHINGTON D COUNTY SAID FOR DECADES THERE S BEEN A PERSISTENT MYTH THAT EVERYONE IS RESPONSIBLE AND IF EVERYONE IS RESPONSIBLE THEN NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE RICK S WORK FOR THE FIRST TIME IDENTIFIES A DISCRETE CLASS OF DEFENDANTS

HEDE YES I WAS PLEASED TO READ THAT

AND I AGREE BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MY FOCUS ON ATTRIBUTING RESPONSIBILITY TO CARBON PRODUCERS IS THAT THEY NEED TO SHARE AND ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY NOT THAT THEY ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE OR THAT CONSUMERS AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE NONE

BAS DOES THAT MEAN THAT LAWSUITS ARE A POSSIBILITY

HEDE I SUPPOSE THAT THAT IMPLICATION IS BEING CONSIDERED BUT I M PURELY AN INDEPENDENT SCIENTIST I M HAPPY TO PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE DATA TO ANYONE WHO ASKS INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS IT IS DEFINITELY BEING EXPLORED BY PEOPLE SUCH AS THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MASSACHUSETTS MARTHA HEALEY AND STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN OF NEW YORK



BAS WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE FROM YOUR WORK

HEDE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS FAR CHEAPER PER UNIT THAN ADDING GENERATING CAPACITY WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THE MONEY TO DO THAT AFTER ALL IF WE CAN SUBSIDIZE FOSSIL FUEL DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT TO INCREASE SUPPLY THEN WE CAN SPEND MONEY ON REDUCING DEMAND WITH THAT IN MIND REGULATION IS IMPORTANT

IT S WHAT THESE COMPANIES DO HENCEFORTH THAT MATTERS DO THEY KEEP THEIR HEAD IN THE OIL SAND AND FIGHT CHANGE OR DO THEY UNDERSTAND THAT EMBRACING CLIMATE STEWARDSHIP GETS LOYALTY FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS

AND ON A RELATED NOTE YOU AND I MAY NOT BE CARBON MAJORS BUT WE NEED TO DO OUR PART TOO IN SAVING FUEL AND BEHAVING RESPONSIBLY THAT S ONE REASON I HAVE BUILT A HOUSE THAT EMITS APPROXIMATELY TO POUNDS OF CARBON DIOXIDE PER SQUARE FOOT PER YEAR OR ABOUT PERCENT LESS THAN THE AVERAGE SINGLE FAMILY HOME AND IT S WHY I DRIVE FAR LESS THAN AVERAGE AND MODIFY MY LIFE TO RESPECT MY OWN LIMITS ON CARBON EMISSIONS

BUT HEY I FLY A BUNCH AND AM ABOUT TO HIT THE BEACH IN NOVEMBER ZERO CARBON IS NOT YET POSSIBLE AND WE CAN STILL ENJOY LIFE THE OBJECTIVE IS SHARED RESPONSIBILITY AND ACTION NOT REVERTING TO THE STONE AGE AS OUR CRITICS FALSELY ATTRIBUTE TO US
SHUT THEM THE FUCK DOWN WE ARE DYING HERE
PROPONENTS OF NUCLEAR POWER WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT HUMANKIND IS SMART ENOUGH TO STORE NUCLEAR WASTE FOR A QUARTER OF A MILLION YEARS BUT AT THE SAME TIME HUMANKIND IS TOO IGNORANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STORE SOLAR ELECTRICITY OVERNIGHT
START ASKING NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND THEN MAYBE THE USA CAN START SHIPPING TRASH OVER THERE
DENMARK IS ALREADY IMPORTING TRASH FROM COUNTRIES LIKE ENGLAND BECAUSE IT'S MORE EFFICIENT TO BURN IT IN DENMARK
FINISH ARMY GONNA KICK ASS MAYBE THEY CAN TEAM UP WITH CAPTAIN PLANET
IT'S NOT EVEN GOING TO BE ECONOMICAL TO DRILL THERE FOR THE NEXT YEARS AT LEAST ESPECIALLY WITH THE HUGE PERMIAN BASIN RESERVE MUCH EASIER TO GET TO
EVERY GRAM OF CARBON WE EXTRACT FROM THE EARTH TO PUT IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS MOVING US CLOSER TO INEVITABLE CLIMATE DEATH IT'S CRAZY THAT PEOPLE ARE STILL ADVOCATING IN FAVOR OF THIS WHEN THE NORTH POLE IS DEGREES OVER NORMAL
I AM AMAZED BY HOW COMICALLY EVIL REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO BE WHAT THE FUCK GUYS
DO THEY THINK PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO NOTICE WE NEED A WAY TO INFILTRATE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION TO BE IN FRONT OF EVERYONE ON SOCIAL MEDIA
I'D PROBABLY GO TO WISCONSIN OR MINNESOTA
WHAT'S YOUR REGION USA ARE YOU OPEN TO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD

1ST GO FOR A CRATON ANCIENT CONTINENTAL CRUST LIKE THE CANADIAN SHIELD BECAUSE IT'S USUALLY NOT EARTHQUAKE PRONE

2ND LOOK AT THE WATER SITUATION THERE AGAIN THE CANADIAN SHIELD HAS ABUNDANT LAKES AND STREAMS UNFORTUNATELY THE SOIL IS POOR OVER MUCH OF IT BUT YOU COULD GET LUCKY

3RD STAY INLAND TO REDUCE RISK OF SUPERSTORMS AND SEA LEVEL RISE STAY NORTH TO REDUCE RISK OF TORNADOES THE NORTHERN REACHES OF THE CANADIAN SHIELD ARE GOOD FOR THIS

4TH AVOID FORESTED AREAS IF THE GLOBE CONTINUES TO HEAT WILDFIRES WILL BECOME PROBLEMATIC

BY NOW WE'VE PUSHED YOU TO THE FAR NORTH OF CANADA IS THIS SOMEPLACE YOU THINK YOU COULD LIVE
NOVA SCOTIA THERE ARE LESS THAN A MILLION PEOPLE AND NO EARTHQUAKES
I USE IT OFTEN AS A SARCASTIC DEVICE TO END A BAD DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE TONE THAT AT LEAST SOMETHING WILL MAKE IT OUT ALIVE SOMEHOW I SEE WHAT YOU DESCRIBE PLENTY ON REDDIN NEVER IN PERSON AT LEAST NOT SO FAR I'D PROBABLY REACT THE SAME WAY YOU DO IF I EVER MET SOMEONE WHO USED IT THAT WAY AND GET UP IN THEIR FACE ABOUT IT
IT WAS MEANT TO BE AN EYE-OPENING RESPONSE TO THE IDEA THAT WE ARE KILLING THE PLANET THE FACT IS THAT PLANET WILL GO ON LOTS OF ANIMALS WILL SURVIVE NOT ALL CERTAINLY NATURE WILL ADAPT TO ITS NEW CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE EARTH WILL CONTINUE TO HOST LIFE IN SOME FORM LONG AFTER HUMANS ARE EXTINCT IT'S MEANT TO REMIND PEOPLE NOT TO BE SO EGOCENTRIC AS TO THING WE WILL END THE WORLD AND TO REALIZE THAT WHEN WE ARE FIGHTING TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT WE ARE ACTUALLY FIGHTING TO PROTECT OURSELVES I THINK ORIGINALLY IT WAS MEANT TO BE A RALLYING POINT BUT MANY PEOPLE USE IT IN A FATALISTIC WAY
THE BRIDGE BETWEEN HUMANS AND ANIMALS IS SEMANTIC AT BEST
ALSO THEY WOULD BE WRONG AS ALL THE EXPERTS ARE CLAIMING THE EXTINCTION RATE IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST CRIME IS NOT AGAINST OURSELVES BUT AGAINST THEM WHY SHOULD THEY DIE OUT BECAUSE OF OUR KNOWING CARELESS SELFISH ACTS
IT'S SARCASM SOMETIMES IT IS ALSO INTENDED TO MEAN LOOK WE HAVE THE MOST TO LOSE BUT IF WE ARE UNABLE TO STOP THIS DON'T YOU AGREE THAT THE PLANET WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH US NOT ON IT


GOSH I HOPE THE ANIMALS MAKE IT THEY ARE INNOCENT HUMANS HAVE A CHOICE AND THERE ARE MANY TERRIBLE HUMANS ON TOP OF IT ALL WE ACTIVELY ARE DECIDING TO DESTROY THE PLANET PRIMARILY FOR CONVENIENCE AND PROFIT
AN IMPRESSIVE EXAMPLE OF LOCAL CONTROL WORKING WELL IT WAS NICE TO LEARN OF BERNIE ROLE
WHEN YOU WANT SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS READ PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC PAPERS INSTEAD OF POLITICAL PROPAGANDA
THE ELECTION POLLS AND ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU LISTED AREN'T REALLY SCIENTIFIC THEY'RE JUST OPINIONS COMING FROM EXTREMELY BIASED MEDIA OF COURSE THE MEDIA COULD BE BLOWING CLIMATE CHANGE OUT OF PROPORTION AS WELL PERSONALLY I'LL TRUST THE OPINIONS OF PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS THAT SPEND ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF TIME STUDYING THE ENVIRONMENT I'M IN NO POSITION TO ARGUE AGAINST THEM JUST LIKE I WOULDN'T ARGUE THE NIGHT SKY WITH AN ASTRONOMER BUT ARTICLES AND OPINION PIECES IN THE NEWS I WOULD TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT IF POSSIBLE ITS BETTER TO SKIP THE NEWS ARTICLE AND GO STRAIGHT TO THE REFERENCES AND READ THE SOURCE STUDY JOURNALISTS AREN'T TRAINED IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE SO ONCE THEY GRAB A STUDY AND MAKE AN ARTICLE BLOWING IT OUT OF PROPORTION JUST TO PUSH THEIR AGENDA IT ISN'T REALLY WORTH READING

I'M NOT SAYING SCIENTISTS ARE INFALLIBLE THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME FAKE SHIT BUT THEY PROBABLY AREN'T ALL LYING AND TO ME A LOT OF IT IS JUST COMMON SENSE I WOULDN'T POUR MYSELF A CUP OF GASOLINE SO I DON'T WANT ANY IN MY WATER SUPPLY EITHER I'M NOT GOING TO SIT BEHIND A CAR AND HUFF THE EXHAUST PIPE FOR AN HOUR ITS OBVIOUSLY BAD SO LOGIC SAYS THAT BREATHING THE SAME POLLUTANTS DISPERSED IN THE AIR WILL ALSO BUT TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT BE BAD FOR YOU I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN A HEAVILY POLLUTED AREA BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T IT'S PRETTY SHITTY LOL

I THINK THE BIG ISSUE IS SAYING THE WORLD WILL BE DESTROYED CLIMATE CHANGE WILL DEFINITELY ALTER THE WORLD BUT REALISTICALLY THE MAJORITY OF LIFE WILL JUST CHANGE ADAPT AND MOVE ON HOW DEVASTATING THE CHANGE WILL BE REALLY DEPENDS ON LOCATION
TROLL
I THINK IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY YOU DECIDE TO LISTEN TO
YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT CURRENT TRENDS NO NEED TO MAKE PROJECTIONS CURRENT TRENDS ARE ALREADY TERRIFYING
BASED PURELY OFF YOUR TITLE AND A VERY SMALL SKIM OF THE ARTICLE I BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE DO GRIEVE OVER THEM BUT IN REALITY IT TAKES A LOT FOR A PERSON TO MORN OVER SOMETHING THEY HAVE NEVER FORMED A REAL ATTACHMENT TO ITS LIKE A DEFENSE MECHANISM SO WE DON'T WALK AROUND BEING DEPRESSED OF THE TIME THAT SAID ITS NOT A POSITIVE THING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
WELL I DO BUT I AM FEELING INCREASINGLY ALONE
AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS ON THE CONSERVATION OF WILDLIFE I CERTAINLY DO GRIEVE FOR EXTINCT SPECIES MOST OF MY SOCIAL NETWORK SHARES MY VALUES AND ALSO GRIEVES

AT THE END OF THE DAY WE STILL HAVE TO GET ON WITH LIFE AS GRIEVING BY ITSELF DOESN'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING ACTION TO PREVENT MORE EXTINCTIONS ABOVE THE NATURAL BACKGROUND RATE OF EXTINCTIONS DOES THOUGH
EVEN THOSE THAT GRIEVE TEND TO IGNORE THE ONES THAT KILLED OFF EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN KILLING OF SPECIES FOR FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS
I GRIEVE FOR THEM THE ONLY WAY TO SEE THE PASSENGER PIGEON OR CAROLINA PARAKEET IS IN A PICTURE IT WOUNDS MY SOUL THAT HUMANS ARE SO THOUGHTLESSLY CRUEL AND DESTRUCTIVE
WELL MAYBE IF WE STOPPED DRILLING THE CORAL THEY WOULD BOUNCE BACK FASTER S
WHATEVER LIFE IS THERE WILL BE FOUND AND DESTROYED BY THE EXPORTATION OF GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF FREEDOM FROM THE UNITED STATES
OF IT WAS DEAD BUT NOW ONLY IS DEAD
THEY'RE TEMPORARY HOLDING CELLS NOT KENNELS

CONTENT NEWS
I'D BE INTERESTED TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THIS SUB ARE ALREADY VEGAN VEGETARIAN OR AT LEAST CONSUMING LESS MEAT THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON MY GUESS IS THE RATE OBSERVED HERE IS HIGHER THAN THE POPULATION AVERAGE
I WENT VEGETARIAN RECENTLY I LOVE MEAT BUT I'LL GLADLY GIVE IT UP UNTIL THERE'S A WAY TO PRODUCE IT WITHOUT BEING SO COSTLY TO THE ENVIRONMENT
I'M CANADIAN IF I WAS MOSTLY TROUBLED BY ELECTION IT WAS ON MATTERS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE

WHILE IT'S HARD FOR ME TO MOVE THE CENTRE OF US POLITICAL DISCOURSE FROM UP HERE I'VE RESOLVED TO DO MORE

IN THE PAST I'VE MADE DECISIONS LIKE SELLING MY CAR AND TAKING MASS TRANSIT COMPOSTING AND KEEPING MY FOOTPRINT SMALL LESS AIRPLANE TRIP VACATIONS MORE BY BUS TRAIN I ALSO MADE THE DECISION THIS PAST YEAR TO EAT MORE VEGETARIAN WHILE I STARTED ONE DAY A WEEK I'M NOW PLEDGING TO ADD ONE MORE COMPLETE DAY A WEEK FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS UNTIL I'M COMPLETELY VEGETARIAN

REALIZE IT'S A SMALLER GESTURE THAN GOING FULL VEGETARIAN IMMEDIATELY BUT IT'S A PERSONAL PROCESS AND I'M COMMITTING MYSELF TO IT BY EACH YEAR I WILL CUT MY MEAT CONSUMPTION BY TO THE POINT THAT BY THE END OF FIRST TERM I WILL HAVE A DIET THAT IS VEGETARIAN OF DAYS IN THE WEEK

IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO AND I WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK TO DO MORE
VERY CLEVER HE JUST WANTS TO TAKE ALL THE GAIN AND THEN LEAVE US WITH NO MEAT
DON'T WORRY WE'LL ALL BE EATING LESS OF EVERYTHING VERY SOON
I STARTED EATING MEAT MUCH LESS IT'S CHEAPER ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY I LOST WEIGHT AND ALTHOUGH AT FIRST I REALLY MISSED THE MEAT NOW I DON'T I EAT IT MAYBE ONCE A WEEK NOW AND I FEEL GREAT NOT TO MENTION SELF-SATISFIED

BUT SERIOUSLY THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO EAT LESS MEAT
SO LONG AS YOU GET YOUR SOCIETY TO STOP CONSUMING ASS LOADS OF FOSSIL FUELS WHILE YOU DO IT GO RIGHT AHEAD
FUCK YOU ARNOLD AND FUCK THIS PLANET I'LL SUCK AS MUCH COCK AS I WANT
HE HIMSELF HIS LIFESTYLE HIS TRAVEL AND HIS TOYS HAVE HAD THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF TUNGUSKA

GUY WHO TO THIS DAY LIKES TAKING HIS 2 MILE PER GALLON AVEYRON OUT FOR A SPIN ON WEEKENDS TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO MAKE ENVIRONMENTAL CHOICES

THANKS ARNIE

DICTATES FROM THE PRIVATE JET TRAVEL HOLLYWOOD ARISTOCRACY GET MORE PEOPLE TO SHUT THEIR EARS THAN THEY EVER CAN OPEN MINDS THEY ALL NEED TO SHUT UP SELL WHAT THEY OWN GIVE AWAY THE PROCEEDS AND LEAVE THE LA LAWN CIRCUS FOR MODEST LIVING IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY

YOU HEAR ME U GOVSCHWARZENEGGER UP YOURS HYPOCRITE GO FATHER A BUNCH MORE ILLEGITIMATE KIDS GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
WHAT A JOKE AND THE DECADES HE POPULARIZED GIANT SUVS AND OTHER POLLUTING VEHICLES WHAT ABOUT THAT ARNOLD
SO THE RICH CAN KEEP ON MAKING MONEY FROM FOSSIL FUEL
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE ON REDDIN NOT LONG AGO ABOUT A FARMER THAT WAS FEEDING HIS COWS WITH SEA FOOD OR SOMETHING THAT MAKES COWS EMIT ZERO EMISSION SO WHY NOT BOTH
HOW MANY CARBON DIOXIDES WERE RELEASED WHEN THIS MONSTROSITY WAS BUILT
BUT THEN HOW DO WE GET TO BE AS BUFF AS HIM
NUMBER

AMERICA
I'LL EAT ONE MEAT FOR EVERY TIME HE'S FLOWN IN A JET
ONE FOR CERTAIN NOT MANY PEOPLE IN THIS THREAD ARE GONNA GET TO HAVE THEIR PUDDING
HOW ABOUT PEOPLE HAVE LESS KIDS SO I CAN EAT MY STEAK AND OVERALL CONSUMPTION DROPS

I DON'T HAVE KIDS
HE SIGNED UP FOR MILITARY SERVICE JUST SO HE COULD EAT MORE MEAT WHAT'S HYPOCRITE IN GERMAN
NO CAN DO ARNOLD BUT I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTION
CAN'T WE JUST EAT EACH OTHER AND SOLVE TWO PROBLEMS AT ONCE
I SAW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS LAST WEEK HE WAS DOING IT BECAUSE HIS DOCTOR TOLD HIM HIS BODY COULDN'T HANDLE EATING SO MUCH MEAT SO HE IS CUTTING BACK INTERESTING THAT HE IS SPINNING IT INTO AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE
I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE BUT IT'S WORTH REPEATING IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE'RE EATING MEAT THAT WE'RE HAVING GLOBAL WARMING IT'S BECAUSE OF FOSSIL FUELS

WITHOUT FOSSIL FUELS WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS ISSUE THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE EXTRA INTRODUCED TO THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH BURNING FOSSIL FUELS ARE CAUSING ISSUES TRYING TO MAKE MEAT A GLOBAL WARMING ISSUE IS JUST A RED HERRING TO EITHER DISTRACT FROM FOSSIL FUELS OR PUSHING OTHER AGENDAS EAST G VEGANS AND OR ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS

IN THE US AGRICULTURE IS AROUND OF TOTAL EMISSIONS THIS ALSO INCLUDES PLANT GROWN FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION WHILE ENERGY PRODUCTION IS AND TRANSPORTATION IS SO IT THOSE FEW PERCENTAGES FROM MEAT ISN'T A BIG DEAL WHAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON IS THE OTHER

SECTOR EMISSION CHART

EPA SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

IF SOMEONE WAS GETTING FAT AND OF THEIR DIET WAS COCA COLA YOU'D TELL THEM TO CUT DOWN ON THE COKE NOT THE FOOD

I POSTED THIS IN ANOTHER THREAD



YOU DON'T EAT BEEF JUST FOR THE ENERGY THE MAIN REASON YOU EAT MEAT IS FOR THE PROTEIN AND WHEN YOU COMPARE THOSE NUMBERS TO PLANT SOURCES OF PROTEIN YOU SEE THAT THERE ISN'T A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR GOING VEGETARIAN VEGAN AND ANY ISSUES WE HAVE WITH BEEF CAN BE REMEDIED BY BETTER AGRICULTURAL METHODS AND FOCUSING ON CUTTING OUT FOSSIL FUELS A MUCH BETTER TARGET WILL ALSO LOWER THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE US MEAT ISN'T A BIG DEAL FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE US CURRENTLY ALL AGRICULTURE INCLUDING THE PLANTS WE EAT ONLY REPRESENT ABOUT OF OUR TOTAL EMISSIONS SO MEAT MIGHT BE OF THAT

FIGURE

IN EMISSION SOURCES ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE AGRICULTURAL CHAPTERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR PERCENT OF TOTAL U SOUTH
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AGRICULTURE

THE DRAFT ALSO SHOWS THAT THIS IS DECLINING AS A PERCENTAGE TO CHAPTER

AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL COMMON MEATS AND PROTEIN SOURCES PRODUCED WITH DECENT PRACTICES CEDERBERG IT'S ONLY BEEF THAT'S AN OUTLIER I'LL INCLUDE QUERN AS A VEGETARIAN PROTEIN REFERENCE QUERN

FIGURE

FOOD KG EQ KG

BEEF
PORK
QUERN

BONE FREE PERCENTAGES USED BEEF PORK CHICKEN AS THE NUMBERS IN CEDERBERG IS WITH BONE EXAMPLE KG KG FOR BEEF DIVIDED BY IS

SO JUST CUTTING OUT BEEF WOULD LIKELY BE THE SAME AS OR EVEN BETTER THAN GOING VEGETARIAN THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE NEW FARMING METHODS WHICH COULD INCREASE CARBON SEQUESTRATION OF GRAZING LAND TO SIMILAR LEVELS OF FOREST LAND

HERE WE SHOW THAT THESE FARMS ACCUMULATED C AT MG HA YR INCREASING CATION EXCHANGE AND WATER HOLDING CAPACITY BY AND RESPECTIVELY THUS WITHIN A DECADE OF GRAZING PRACTICES SOIL C LEVELS RETURNED TO THOSE OF NATIVE FOREST SOILS AND LIKELY DECREASED FERTILIZER AND IRRIGATION DEMANDS

MACHMULLER MB ET AL EMERGING LAND USE PRACTICES RAPIDLY INCREASE SOIL ORGANIC MATTER NAT COMMON APR DOI COMMAS

FOR REFERENCE THE CEDERBERG PAPER LISTS SWEDEN AS PRODUCING TONS OF BEEF PER YEAR ON HECTARES OR KG HA THIS IS AROUND TONS OF PER HECTARE PER YEAR AND THE ABOVE PAPER SHOWS THEY CAN STORE TONS OF PER HECTARE PER YEAR

SO IT LOOKS LIKE BEEF CAN LIKELY BE FAIRLY CLOSE TO NEUTRAL DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S PRODUCED

A BIT RELATED TO ALL OF THIS I POSTED A COMMENT IN ANOTHER THREAD ALL VEGETARIAN PROTEIN SOURCES BEING IN A SIMILAR RANGE TO NOT EATING BEEF FOR REFERENCE CHICKEN BEING KG KG AND PORK AT KG KG



AND AS A COMPARISON HERE'S SOME COMMON PROTEIN RICH PLANT SOURCES NORMALIZED TO PROTEIN CONTENT

TEXTURED VEGETABLE PROTEIN IS FROM GLETSCHER

SEISTAN USES KG EQ KG OF DRY PASTA BARILLA AND PROTEIN CONTENT USDA DRY PASTA GLUTEN ISN'T A COMPLETE PROTEIN SO THIS UNDERESTIMATES THE COST A BIT AS YOU'LL HAVE TO USE ANOTHER SOURCE TO BALANCE THE MISSING AMINO ACIDS

LEGUMES IS OF AVERAGED KG EQ KG FOR KIDNEY BEANS AND CHICKPEAS IN TESCO USING A BASE OF PROTEIN USDA RAW KIDNEY BEANS

THERE ARE ALSO SOME ISSUES WITH PROTEIN DIGESTIBILITY FROM PLANT SOURCES KARWAR GILAKI EVEN WITH COOKING FOR MINUTES FERMENTING AND THEN MILLING BEAN TEMPEH THE PROTEIN IS AT DIGESTIBILITY SEE TABLE 2 AND EVEN WITH COMPLETE PROTEINS THE AMOUNT OF AMINO ACIDS PER GRAM PROTEIN DIFFERS BETWEEN PLANT AND MEAT PROTEIN BEEF HAS ABOUT MORE OF IT'S LIMITING ESSENTIAL AMINO ACID WHEN COMPARED TO SOY

SO ONCE PEOPLE SWITCH AWAY FROM BEEF TO PORK CHICKEN THERE'S NO SIGNIFICANT GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFIT TO SWITCHING TO PLANT SOURCES OF PROTEIN EUROPEANS ESPECIALLY NEED TO BE CAREFUL AS SOME SOYBEANS CAN HAVE A COST OF UP TO KG EQ KG GUIRALDES CASTANHEIRA
RIGHT NOW I AM AFRAID FOR THE PLANET'S PRESENT ONE SEASON OF GENERALIZED CROP FAILURE AND WE ARE DONE BASICALLY
NAH THAT'S OKAY
I DON'T EAT MEAT OR PLANTS BUZ ALL OF THESE ARE LIVING CREATURES WITH FEELINGS
ARKANSAS FIGHT TO SHUT DOWN THE ONLY BAFO OPERATING INSIDE THE BUFFALO RIVER WATERSHED WHO'S RIGHT
DOES THAT MEAN SLOWING DOWN CLIMATE CHANGE AND METHANE BUBBLES POPPING I WOULD HATE TO RECOMMEND DESTROYING THE AMAZON BUT
SADLY WE ARE NOT REALLY AHEAD OF TARGET BECAUSE THE PACIFIC OCEAN IS DYING AS THE TEMPERATURE RISES IT HOLDS LESS AND LESS OXYGEN IN JUST YRS IT'S PREDICTED TO NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN LIFE WHEN THE OCEANS DIE WE WILL DIE NOT TOO LONG AFTER THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM IS COLLAPSING AT THIS POINT AND THERE IS REALLY NOT A THING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT NUMEROUS UNSTOPPABLE FEEDBACK LOOPS HAVE BEEN SET IN MOTION FROM THE EXTRA HEAT BEING ADDED DAILY BEING TERMED UNSTOPPABLE TO THE EXPONENTIAL RELEASE OF BILLIONS OF TONS OF METHANE FROM MELTING PERMAFROST AND OCEAN BOTTOMS NOPE MANY SCIENTISTS PREDICT THIS IS THE LAST HUMAN GENERATION ON EARTH
ACTUALLY THE REASON COAL IS DWINDLING IS BECAUSE ANOTHER FOSSIL FUEL NATURAL GAS IS MORE COMPETITIVE YOU'RE ARE ONLY SEEING A TREE IN THE FOREST IF YOU ONLY CONCENTRATE ON COAL DESPITE ALL THE FEEL GOOD ARTICLES LIKE THIS MANMADE GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION IS STILL INCREASING
DUE TO OTHER COUNTRIES CHOOSING SOLAR AND PRIVATE OWNER SHIP OF SOLAR POWER COAL WON'T BE MAKING A COMEBACK
HOWS IT POSSIBLE THAT NOBODY IN THE COAL INDUSTRY IS DEMANDING TO BE RETRAINED TO WORK IN THE NEXT BIG INDUSTRY IT'S AS IF THEY NOT ONLY KNOW THEIR INDUSTRY IS DYING BUT WANT TO SOMEHOW PRESERVE IT FOREVER WTF PPL
I AM GUESSING WE WILL KEEP HEARING ABOUT THESE KINDS OF EXTREMES MORE AND MORE AND GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AS YEARS GO BY UNTIL WE REALIZE ITS TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT

THE REAL PROBLEM IS OVERPOPULATION WE HAVE TO URGENTLY START DEALING WITH IT OR WE WONT MAKE IT
IF PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP HAS A PERSONAL FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO ENACT POLICY THAT COULD HURT HIS CONSTITUENTS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEN HE NEEDS TO HAVE HIS FINANCIAL DEALINGS INVESTIGATED

CALL YOUR LEGISLATIVE BRANCH REPS AND SPECIFICALLY CALL LEADERS ON THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND DEMAND THEY INVESTIGATE TRUMP FOR KLEPTOCRACY NEPOTISM AND UNDERHANDED DEALING IF HE HAS FINANCIAL TIES TO POLLUTERS THEN HE NEEDS TO BE CHASTISED

TO BE FAIR CLINTON WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING OF REAL IMPACT SHE ONLY SAID THE BARE MINIMUM TO SECURE VOTES
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S TRUE STUFF HAS HAPPENED BEFORE AND EVERYONE AGAINST IS AN ANTI SCIENCE MORON LOOK A FEW POSTS DOWN SO FAR WE'VE TAKEN YEARS TO UNRAVEL DAMAGE FROM THE SUGAR AND FAT LIES AND STILL OF PEOPLE STORES DIETS DON'T GET IT EVEN NOW IT'S BEEN DEBUNKED TAKES LITERALLY LIFETIMES TO UNDO DAMAGE OF BAD SCIENCE

SECTIONS

FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE GLOBAL WARMING ISN'T A BIG MISTAKE LESS LIKELY A HOAX AND I'VE SPENT YEARS ANALYZING THE DATA AND READING UP ON IT AND KNOW HOW BADLY MODELS ARE PRONE TO UNCONSCIOUS BIAS
FIJI WAS PROBABLY INVENTED BY THE CHINESE
SHIT ARTICLE NOWHERE DOES IT MENTION WHAT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE ON FIJI AND EVEN IF THERE WERE EFFECTS THAT STILL DOESN'T PROVE IT'S BECAUSE OF HUMANS

THE ISLAND OF TUVALU TRIED TO BLAME SEA LEVEL RISES ON THEIR FRESH WATER WELLS BEING CONTAMINATED WITH SEA WATER INSTEAD IT WAS THEIR OWN PEOPLE LIVING UNSUSTAINABLY BY DRAWING TOO MUCH FRESH WATER

WAS THAT MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE WAS THE FACT THAT SOME ATOLLS HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED IN AREA MENTIONED NUMBER THIS IS PROPAGANDA
WHO CARES ABOUT THE NORTH POLE RIGHT IT'S NOT IN AMERICA WHAT IF ESKIMOS DID IT
THOSE ARE FOLIO FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD COUNTY

PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THAT DISTINCTION EXPLICIT WHEN WRITING HAVING TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT UNITS BOTH USING THE TERM DEGREES IS CONFUSING AND EVERYONE SHOULD CONSIDER BEING EXPLICIT WHEN ADDRESSING AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE SUCH AS THIS SUBREDDIT ESPECIALLY THE LESSER USED VARIANT

WIKI FILE
I LIVE IN MAINE AND IT'S GOING TO BE DEG F AGAIN TODAY IT GETS COOL AT NIGHT S THEN ZOOMS BACK UP TO DURING THE DAY IT'S NOT RIGHT THIS ISN'T INDIAN SUMMER WEATHER IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WINTER COLD NOW
WINTER
THESE ARE ONLY SYMPTOMS OF THE REAL PROBLEM WHICH IS OVERPOPULATION ITS A TABOO TO TALK ABOUT IT THOUGH
WE'RE SO FUCKED HAH
SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING IS GOING QUITE WELL INTO OUR DEMISE
UH OH
WELP WE'RE BONED
WE HUMANS ARE NOMADIC IN NATURE WE MOVE TO A NEW PLACE EVERY TIME RESOURCES ARE RUNNING OUT WHEN WE STARTED TO SETTLE WE STILL USED MORE AND MORE SPACE FROM OUTSIDE TO SUSTAIN THE SETTLEMENT I THINK WHAT IAM TRYING TO SAY IS YES WE CAN LIVE AS SUSTAINABLE AS POSSIBLE AND BALANCE NATURE OUT SO THAT SHE WORKS IN OUR FAVOUR BUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT IS TO COLONIZE OTHER PLANETS IT IS THE ONLY WAY THE HUMAN SPICES CAN SURVIVE AS A WHOLE
EARTHQUAKE DENIAL IS NEXT EVEN THOUGH SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE WILL BE SHOWN
GOOD OP RELEVANT DAY OLD RESEARCH THAT ISN'T LOCKED BEHIND A GRAYWALL THANKS FOR SHARING THAT PAPER WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO READ


SO STOP FUCKING BRACKING SEEMS LIKE AN EASY DECISION
STOP RAPING MOTHER NATURE SHE SHALL STOP ACTING OUT WONT SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN
OKLAHOMA IS THE INDUCED EARTHQUAKE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD NOW THANKS TO THE BRACKING
WRONG

E S
THIS MIGHT BE TRUE IN CANADA BUT IT WOULD NEVER WORK IN THE US CANADIAN GEOLOGY IS JUST SO MUCH MORE HOMOGENEOUS THAN AMERICA'S
SAYS THE ANTI BRACKING SCIENTIST
DELETED
WHEN CHINA IS IS EXPLAINING GLOBAL WARMING TO YOU YOU HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES
CHINA DOESN'T REALIZE THEY ARE TALKING TO A MAN WITH A YEAR OLDS INTELLECT
TRUMP IS HALF CHARLATAN HALF SOLIPSIST HALF SENILE AND HALF ANARCHIST
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO REACT THIS WAY BUT EVERY TIME I SEE ARTICLES LIKE THIS ONE MY HEART BREAKS I WISH I HAD A FAST SOLUTION
IT'S AMAZING TO BE WITNESS TO THIS TYPE OF GLOBAL SYSTEM SHIFT I WONDER WHAT WE'LL SEE IN THE VERY SHORT PERIOD OF OUR LIFE SPANS
I HAVE A FEELING THAT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE HIT ANOTHER ICE AGE
THIS IS KIND OF A DUMB ARTICLE I AM TOTALLY ON BOARD WITH CLIMATE CHANGE BUT THIS IS JUST NORMAL WEATHER FOLKS THE POLE IS VERY WARM RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF A NEGATIVE ARCTIC OSCILLATION WHILE YES IT IS WARM IT IS ALSO RECORD COLD IN SIBERIA NORTHERN EUROPE AND AND TO A LESSER EXTENT CANADA

WHEN THE AO FLIPS POSITIVE ALL THE COLD AIR WILL STAY TRAPPED AT THE POLE
GREEN ENERGY CAN REVOLUTIONIZE THE WORLD BY CREATING JOBS POWER FOR EVERYONE WIDER INTERNET BETTER EDUCATION ECT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE A DOMINO EFFECT WITH GREAT OUTCOMES
FOR THOSE NOT OPENING THE TAX IS ABOUT A LEVEL NECESSARY TO OFFSET THEIR FOOTPRINT WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY NOT HAPPENING BUT DOES DEMONSTRATE THE SCALE
SO WHO IS GOING TO SUFFER THE MOST FROM THIS TAX ON FOOD
YEAH MORE TAXES
A BABY TAX WOULD BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
AMID ALL THE BAD NEWS OF THIS LAST WEEK IT'S ENCOURAGING AT LEAST TO SEE AMERICA CAN'T BULLY THE WORLD OUT OF ENVIRONMENTALISM ANYMORE
I THOUGHT THERE WAS ONLY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD MAYBE I'M WRONG
THIS ACTUALLY DOESN'T HURT THE PIPELINE THEY WOULD JUST SELL THE LOAN TO ANOTHER FINANCE ENTITY OR GIVE THEIR MONEY AWAY TO THE PIPELINE

EDIT A WORD
ENDERLIN

PERHAPS THIS WILL START A TREND KEEP THE PRESSURE ON THEM
A WHOPPING MILLION DOLLAR SALE OF STOCK
COAL IS SHIT NO MORE COAL PLANTS LOOKING AT YOU TRUMP AND CHINA
FOR ANYONE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO ANSWER THE SURVEY

IT MAY SEEM ODD FOR SCIENTISTS TO BE RESEARCHING AN ATMOSPHERIC EVENT FROM YEARS AGO WHEN THERE ARE PLENTY OF MODERN ISSUES TO GRAPPLE WITH BUT SOMETIMES LESSONS FROM THE PAST CAN ASSIST WITH OUR CURRENT CROP OF PROBLEMS THAT S THE CASE WITH NEW RESEARCH FROM TEXAS A M UNIVERSITY NOT ONLY HAVE THEY GOTTEN TO THE BOTTOM OF A HISTORICAL PROBLEM BUT THE RESULTS COULD GIVE VALUABLE INSIGHTS IN TACKLING POLLUTION IN THE WORLD S MOST HEAVILY POLLUTED TOWNS AND CITIES

THE EVENT IN QUESTION IS THE KILLER FOG THAT HIT LONDON FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN FIRST APPEARING ON DECEMBER IT LIFTED FOUR DAYS LATER WITH AN ESTIMATED DEATH TOLL OF AT LEAST PEOPLE WITH AROUND HOSPITALIZATIONS AND THOUSANDS OF UNDOCUMENTED ANIMAL DEATHS ALTHOUGH THE CLEAN AIR ACT WAS PASSED PARTLY IN RESPONSE FOUR YEARS LATER THE ACTUAL CAUSES OF THE INCIDENT HAVE GONE UNKNOWN UNTIL NOW

THROUGH ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS OF FOG IN CHINA AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TEXAS A M RESEARCHER DR RENI ZHANG AND HIS TEAM CAME UP WITH THEIR ANSWER NITROGEN DIOXIDE CONVERTING COMPARATIVELY BENIGN SULFUR DIOXIDE INTO LETHAL SULFURIC ACID

PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN THAT SULFATE WAS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO THE FOG AND SULFURIC ACID PARTICLES WERE FORMED FROM SULFUR DIOXIDE RELEASED BY COAL BURNING FOR RESIDENTIAL USE AND POWER PLANTS AND OTHER MEANS EXPLAINED ZHANG BUT HOW SULFUR DIOXIDE WAS TURNED INTO SULFURIC ACID WAS UNCLEAR

AIR POLLUTION WILL KILL MILLION PEOPLE PER YEAR BY THIS MAP SHOWS WHY
AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS FOOTBALLER PERFORMANCE CLAIMS STUDY
THESE PIGEONS ARE LEADING THE FIGHT AGAINST LONDON S AIR POLLUTION
OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT THIS PROCESS WAS FACILITATED BY NITROGEN DIOXIDE ANOTHER OF COAL BURNING AND OCCURRED INITIALLY ON NATURAL FOG ANOTHER KEY ASPECT IN THE CONVERSION OF SULFUR DIOXIDE TO SULFATE IS THAT IT PRODUCES ACIDIC PARTICLES WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY INHIBITS THIS PROCESS NATURAL FOG CONTAINED LARGER PARTICLES OF SEVERAL TENS OF MICROMETERS IN SIZE AND THE ACID FORMED WAS SUFFICIENTLY DILUTED EVAPORATION OF THOSE FOG PARTICLES THEN LEFT SMALLER ACIDIC HAZE PARTICLES THAT COVERED THE CITY

SIMILAR THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN CHINA S MOST POLLUTED CITIES RIGHT NOW THE REASON THERE HASN T BEEN AN INCIDENT LIKE LONDON S KILLER FOG IS DOWN TO CHEMICAL HAPPENSTANCE CHINA USES A LOT OF FERTILISER AND THAT COMBINED WITH THE HEAVY ROAD TRAFFIC RESULTS IN HIGH LEVELS OF AMMONIA WHICH NEUTRALISE THE PARTICLES THE RIGHT CHEMICAL PROCESSES HAVE TO INTERPLAY FOR THE DEADLY HAZE TO OCCUR IN CHINA EXPLAINED ZHANG WHILE THE LONDON FOG WAS HIGHLY ACIDIC CONTEMPORARY CHINESE HAZE IS BASICALLY NEUTRAL


WHICH ISN T TO SAY IT S EXACTLY HEALTHY BUT COMPARED TO THOSE FOUR DAYS IN LONDON IN IT S CERTAINLY PREFERABLE


ZHANG HOPES THAT UNDERSTANDING WHAT CAUSED THE KILLER FOG IN LONDON CAN HELP OTHER CITIES GET TO GRIPS WITH THEIR PROBLEMS IN THE LONG RUN THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLEDGED TO DO ALL IT CAN TO REDUCE EMISSIONS GOING FORWARD BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME WE THINK WE HAVE HELPED SOLVE THE LONDON FOG MYSTERY AND ALSO HAVE GIVEN CHINA SOME IDEAS OF HOW TO IMPROVE ITS AIR QUALITY REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS OF NITROGEN OXIDE AND AMMONIA IS LIKELY EFFECTIVE IN DISRUPTING THIS SULFATE FORMATION PROCESS
THAT WAS PROBABLY ME THANKS
OH LOOK SURVIVAL CRAFTING SIM
THE GREAT SMOG HAS ALWAYS FASCINATED ME EVEN AS A CHILD HOW STRANGE AN OCCURRENCE IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO THOSE EXPERIENCING THE DEATHS OF LOVED ONES AFTERWARDS
I BELIEVED THE THEORY AS MOST DID THROUGHOUT THE YEARS THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY COAL EMISSIONS POLLUTION IN GENERAL IN ENGLAND

HOPE YOU FIND THIS READ INTRIGUING
ARE THERE ANY SCIENTIFICALLY VIABLE SOLUTIONS TO COMBAT THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE OUTSIDE OF CONTROLLING EMISSIONS

I THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ANSWER BOTH WAYS DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DEFINE THE TERMS YOU'VE USED FOR INSTANCE IN YOUR HEADLINE YOU ASKED ABOUT SOLUTIONS OTHERS THAN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN YOUR BODY TEXT YOU ASKED ABOUT SOLUTIONS OTHER THAN CONTROLLING EMISSIONS

GENERALLY SPEAKING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE DEPEND ON THE CONCENTRATION OF GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF INCOMING HEAT FROM THE SUN THE HIGHER THE CONCENTRATION THE STRONGER THE EFFECTS THE STRONGER THE INCOMING HEAT THE STRONGER THE EFFECTS

IN PRINCIPLE WE COULD STOP THE EFFECTS FROM GETTING STRONGER IN THREE WAYS

DECREASING EMISSIONS
2 INCREASING NEGATIVE EMISSIONS
DECREASING INCOMING HEAT

AND OF COURSE ANY COMBINATION OF THESE THREE

IN PRACTICE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'D CALL SCIENTIFICALLY VIABLE

IF YOU UNDERSTAND VIABLE AS DEMONSTRATED FROM A NATURAL SCIENCE POINT OF VIEW SOLUTION NUMBER IS SIMPLY THE BEST ONE BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD AND WIDELY AVAILABLE THINK SOLAR WIND AND NUCLEAR INSTEAD OF COAL AND GAS THINK ELECTRIC CARS INSTEAD OF GASOLINE THINK HEAT EXCHANGER AND SOLAR HEATING INSTEAD OF CENTRAL FOSSIL FUEL BURNING ET CETERA

NUMBER 2 IS STILL UNDERSTOOD VERY WELL BUT IT'S NOT BEEN TESTED ON A LARGE SCALE GIVEN THE AMOUNT WE EMIT THERE'S PROBABLY ALSO A NATURAL LIMIT HOW MANY NEGATIVE EMISSIONS ARE AVAILABLE NUMBER IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD AND NOT BEEN TESTED SOME ARGUE WE SHOULDN'T EVEN TRY TO TEST IT

IF YOU UNDERSTAND VIABLE AS DEMONSTRATED FROM A SOCIAL SCIENCE POINT OF VIEW THERE'S THE ECONOMIC AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE

FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW SOLUTION IS CHEAPER THAN 2 UP TO A CERTAIN POINT THE CURRENT COSTS OF GETTING A TONNE OF OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE IS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND US PER TONNE BIOCHAR DECREASING EMISSION USING THE AFOREMENTIONED MEANS IS CHEAPER WITH A CARBON TAX OF LESS THAN US PER TONNE MOST TECHNOLOGIES FOR REDUCING EMISSION WOULD BE BECOME COMPETITIVE HOWEVER THE MORE EMISSIONS WE'D LIKE TO REDUCE THE HIGHER THE MARGINAL COSTS AT SOME POINT NEGATIVE EMISSIONS WILL BECOME CHEAPER HOWEVER THAT'S FAR IN THE FUTURE SO NUMBER STILL DOMINATES

SOME ARGUE THAT WOULD BE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A COMBINATION OF AND 2 HOWEVER OPPONENTS ARGUE THAT YOU'D BUY A LOT OF RISKS BY TRYING TO SAVE MONEY HERE AND WITHOUT ANY SUFFICIENT COMBINATION OF AND 2 WE'D PROBABLY MAKE OURSELVES DEPENDENT ONE DISTURBANCE OF MANAGING INCOMING HEAT THINK WARS RECESSIONS ETC WOULD BE SUFFICIENT AND WE'LL BE TOAST IF WE DON'T MANAGE GREENHOUSE GAS CONCENTRATION ADDITIONALLY DOESN'T SOLVE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF EMISSIONS FOR THE OCEANS AND OUR DEPENDENCY ON HAVING A LIVING ECOSYSTEM THERE

PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND THEREFORE SOCIALLY AND POLITICALLY IS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF COURSE OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT IT AND YOU WOULDN'T BE MOTIVATED TO ASK IF THERE ARE SOLUTIONS OTHER THAN AND 2
BILL O REILLY ISN'T RETARDED HE KNOWS WHAT THE FACTS ARE AND IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES AND RATINGS UNTIL THE FOOD STOPS ARRIVING ON YOUR PLATE SHOWS THE CLIMATE CIRCLING THE DRAIN ALREADY IT'S DO OR DIE
HALACHA LIBERAL TEARS ARE DELICIOUS
THIS ARTICLE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING OF VALUE

I DON T THINK WE WILL SURVIVE ANOTHER YEARS WITHOUT ESCAPING BEYOND OUR FRAGILE PLANET

THIS IS INCREDIBLY VAGUE WILL EARTH NO LONGER SUPPORT HUMAN LIFE IN YEARS OR WILL WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A COLONY ELSEWHERE BEFORE THAT TIME IF WE DON'T ESTABLISH A COLONY WHY WILL HUMANITY BE DOOMED

THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER PLANETS OR MOONS THAT WE KNOW OF THAT READILY SUPPORT HUMAN LIFE IF WE CAN SURVIVE ELSEWHERE WE CAN SURVIVE HERE IN A WORSE CLIMATE MARS DOES NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORT HUMAN LIFE NATURALLY SO CLIMATE CHANGE OR NOT WE STILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF OUR ATMOSPHERE HERE OR ON MARS

THE POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE GLOBAL PANDEMICS BROUGHT ON BY ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE AND NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES OF WARRING NATIONS

BACTERIA AND VIRUSES WILL ACCOMPANY US TO OTHER PLACES MARS WILL BE TAINTED AS SOON AS WE STEP FOOT THERE IF NOT ALREADY NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY WILL FOLLOW US EVERYWHERE AS WILL AI AND ALL OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE

IF THE ALIENS ARE AGGRESSIVE THEY LL SEE A WEAKENED ENEMY WITH A HABITABLE PLANET THAT S RIPE FOR THE TAKING

OUR SIGNALS HAVEN'T TRAVELED VERY FAR BEYOND LIGHT YEARS FROM US IF THERE WERE ANY AGGRESSIVE ALIENS WITHIN THAT RANGE THAT ARE CAPABLE OF DETECTING US AND COMING HERE THEY WOULD ALREADY KNOW WE ARE HERE
OR
EH

HUMAN TECHNOLOGICAL CIVILISATION HAS MUCH LESS TIME THAN THAT BUT HAWKING IS A MATHEMATICIAN NOT A PALEONTOLOGIST HE'S TALKING ABOUT A SPECIES THAT WEATHERED ICE AGES MASSIVE VOLCANOES MEGAFAUNA SEA LEVEL RISES

HUMANKIND IS A LOT LIKE RATS AND COCKROACHES VERY DAMNED HARD TO KILL
I WOULD GIVE US TEN AT THE OUTSIDE

IF WE CREATE AN AI AS DESCRIBED WHICH IS SUPER INTELLIGENT THEN IT'S FAR GREATER A THREAT TO OUR SURVIVAL THAN ALIENS ALL DEPENDS ON HOW CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH OUR VALUES WE CAN CREATE THE AI
IT COULD BE A HELL OF A LOT LESS THAN YEARS IF WE DON'T GET SERIOUS ABOUT STOPPING FURTHER CLIMATE DAMAGE AND THE WARS IT WILL CAUSE
I'M ALL UP FOR SPACE EXPLORATION BUT I DON'T LIKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT FINDING THE NEXT PLANET IS OUR HUMANITY'S ONLY SOLUTION FROM OURSELVES REMEMBER TO LOOK UP AT THE STARS AND NOT DOWN AT YOUR FEET HECK IF WE IGNORE PROBLEMS AT OUR FEET GREED HATE INEQUALITY ETC WE WILL BRING THEM TO THE NEXT PLACE IF WE EVEN FIND ONE HOSPITABLE TO LIFE SO IT'S NOT REALLY A SOLUTION OTHER THAN MAYBE HELP INCREASE FUNDING WHILE GIVING JUSTIFICATION TO EVERYONE TO CONTINUE TO FUCK THINGS UP ON EARTH
I'M AMAZED HE'S GIVEN US SO MANY I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF OF HUMANITY IS DEAD WITHIN YEARS
GOOD RIDDANCE
EVERYTHING I'VE READ ELSEWHERE SEEMS TO INDICATE WE'RE DONE FOR IN A MUCH SHORTER TIMESPAN WHICH I PERSONALLY THINK IS GREAT WE ARE A PLAGUE ON THIS PLANET AND IT AND ALL THE REST OF ITS SPECIES ARE BETTER OFF WITHOUT US
HE IS WILDLY OPTIMISTIC TO YEARS TOPS
WELL IF THE HAWK SAY IT MUST BE TRUE
ARTICLE COMPLETELY MISDATES WHAT HE SAID COMPLETE BS
AND I PREDICT THAT IN YEARS HUMANITY WILL STILL FALL FOR THIS SHIT SEE WHAT I DID THERE I PREDICTED SOMETHING THAT WE'LL NEVER SEE COME TO FRUITION DOES THAT MAKE ME A GENIUS DOES IT YOU KNOW FOR A MAN THATS SUPPOSEDLY EXTREMELY SMART HE REALLY SEEMS SO FUCKING DUMB SOMETIMES
YEAH I'M SURE THE PLANET WILL SURVIVE IF WE CUT DOWN ON TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS AND STILL KEEP DRINKING BEER
WHAT A HORRIBLE WE SITE
THAT'S A LOT OF ABALONE THERE ON THOSE ROCKS
WOW A COUNTRY THAT GETS HOW SERIOUS CLIMATE CHANGE USA TAKE NOTICE THIS IS HOW A COUNTRY SHOULD ACT NOT TO SAY FRANCE IS GOOD ALL THE TIME
DELETED
NOT SOON ENOUGH IF YOU ASK ME STILL WAY AHEAD OF US RIP US
THEY'RE ALREADY BEGINNING THE POWDER-DOWN
MOST OF THIS IS SOP FOR PROTESTERS THE POLICE KNOW THE CHARGES WILL PROBABLY BE DROPPED SO THEY THE PROCESSING OF THE ARRESTEES TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE HELD FOR HOURS THEY USUALLY DON'T STRIP SEARCH THOUGH THAT'S EVEN MORE EGREGIOUS THAN THE NORMAL TREATMENT
THERE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE COMMENTS YET I SEE ONLY ONE IS REDDIN CENSORING AGAIN
STRIP AWAY THE HYPERBOLE AND THE STORY IS SHE WAS ARRESTED FOR TRESPASS HELD IN A TEMPORARY CELL AND THEN TRANSFERRED TO JAIL AND CHARGED HOURS LATER CONSISTENT WITH POLICIES AGAINST CONTRABAND SHE HAD TO STRIP
IF YOU HAVEN'T JOINED CLIMATE HAWKS VOTE YET THE TIME TO DO SO WE ENDORSE AND ELECT CLIMATE HAWKS WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN
CLIMATEHAWKSVOTE
CAUSE WE KNOW HOW GOOD THE MEDIA HAS BEEN AT PREDICTING ANYTHING AS OF LATE SENSATIONALIZE YOUR HEADLINES SOME MORE I'M NOT EVEN READING THE ARTICLE CAUSE THAT IS NOT NEWS WHEN YOU REPORT ON ASSUMPTIONS INSTEAD OF FACTS
LIKE WHEN OBAMA PROMISED TO CLOSE GIAMO REMEMBER NOT BEING FORCED TO PAY FOR A HEALTH PLAN WITH DEDUCTIBLES YOU CAN'T EVEN AFFORD
THAT'S A HORRIBLE ATTITUDE I'M GOING TO APPROACH THIS LIKE BERNIE SANDERS HAS BEEN THE PAST FEW DAYS TAKE THE GOOD STUFF FIGHT THE BAD STUFF IF TRUMP TRIES TO IGNORE THIS HE'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOME LOUD ENVIRONMENTALISTS IF HE CHOOSES TO FOLLOW THIS THEN HE GETS PRAISE FROM US FOR THIS ISSUE TRUMP IS NOT A NICE FELLOW AND HE HAS MANY OBJECTIONABLE VIEWPOINTS BUT WE HAVE TO HOPE HE WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND FIGHT HIM WHEN HE DOESN'T YOU CATCH MORE FLIES WITH HONEY
DESPITE THE EXECUTIVE ACTIONS THIS SUBREDDIT LOVES THESE PRESIDENTIAL POWERS LOOK DIFFERENT WHEN A PRESIDENT THIS SUBREDDIT DOESN'T LIKE GETS ELECTED

FRANKLY OBAMA WENT OVER THE LINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS WITH HIS EXECUTIVE ACTIONS BYPASSING CONGRESSIONAL AFTER TRUMP REVOKES ALL THE EXECUTIVE ACTIONS THAT OBAMA TOOK I HOPE HE WORKS WITH CONGRESS TO SCALE BACK THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENT TO BYPASS CONGRESS WITHOUT USING THE POWER HIMSELF
OR HOW ABOUT LETTING G REVERSE OSMOSIS PLANTS BE BUILT IN PLACES LIKE SAN DIEGO THERE WAS ONE THAT WAS SHUT DOWN NEAR THERE RECENTLY I KNOW THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THEM BUT SURELY THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGHS THE COSTS

SEE ALSO

WOW I HOPE SURVIVAL INTERNATIONAL IS STOPPED FROM WIPING THEM OUT

ONLY JOKING
THEY WILL PROBABLY GIVE THEM AWAY TO THOSE SO-CALLED MILITANTS THE BUNDYS WHO WANT FREE STUFF FROM THE GOVERNMENT
LET'S NOT FORGET THE FARMERS I WATCHED A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HOW COMPANIES LIKE TYSON PROCURE CHICKENS THE CONTRACTS THAT FARMERS HAVE TO FOLLOW ARE CRAZY AND THEY END UP MAKING VERY LITTLE WHILE BEING FORCED TO RAISE ANIMALS IN CONDITIONS THEY DISAGREE WITH CAPITALISM SURE IS AMAZING
MAJOR AMERICAN COMPANIES LIKE MONSANTO

IT'S WEIRD TO FIND MYSELF ON THE SAME PLATFORM WITH THEM
I FEEL THAT THE MOTIVATION OF THESE COMPANIES ARE MONETARILY FAR MORE SHORT TERM THAN THEY SAY THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DEAL THAT WILL MAKE THEM MONEY BEYOND CLIMATE CONCERNS
LOL MAJOR US CORPS ARE THE REASON WE ARE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE RICHARD
I'M VERY INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH DONALD TRUMP COMING INTO OFFICE IF YOU LOOK HERE AT THE OFFICIAL LAWSUIT IT IS AGAINST BARACK OBAMA TRUMP IS MENTIONED NOWHERE I'M WONDERING IF TRUMP WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT
SO NOW ANY TIME THE CLIMATE DOORS WHAT IT'S ALWAYS DONE CRAZIES WILL COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK AND SUE

SINCE THE ALARMISTS CHANGED THE TERM FROM GLOBAL WARMING TO CLIMATE CHANGE THIS WILL INCLUDE COOLING

MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING IF THERE'S MONEY GOING OUT OF COFFERS THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE REAL DEBATE INSTEAD OF LINING UP FOR A SHARE OF THE TAX ON CARBON THIS WILL ALSO GO TO COURT WHERE SCIENTISTS MUST SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH OR BE CHARGED WITH PURGERY I DOUBT A COURT WITH ACCEPT ALL THE FORTUNE TELLING THE MEDIA PEDDLES AS SCIENCE
CAN I SUE THE GOVERNMENT IF IT RAINS OUT MY GOLF GAME
MUST MAKE THE SHAREHOLDERS HAPPY BULLSHIT
SO NOW WE CAN BOYCOTT COKE AS WELL AS NESTLE
JUST ANOTHER REASON I BOYCOTT NESTLE AND COKE
AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS
NESTLE IS JUST YET THAT SINGLE WORD IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND COMPELLING ARGUMENT FOR BRINGING BACK THE CORPORATE DEATH PENALTY
ARE THEY ALSO BANNING BOTTLED SODA OR JUST WATER SODA BOTTLES ARE MORE OF A PROBLEM THEN WATER BOTTLES IN MY OPINION
COKE IS OWNED BY WARREN BUFFET
CRINGE WORTHY
AMAZING HOW SO LITTLE MONEY INVESTED IN CONTRIBUTIONS CAN LITERALLY TRASH THE ENVIRONMENT


HAH FUCKING HYPERCAPITALIST PIGS
IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THEIR PRODUCTS

IN THIS CASE IF THEY PRODUCED MILLION BOTTLES THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MILLION BOTTLES WERE RECYCLED ANY DISCREPANCIES WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID FOR AFTER ALL SOMEBODY ELSE WILL HAVE TO CLEAN UP THEIR MESS
SO IT'S OKAY TO MAKE CARBONATED SUGAR WATER BEVERAGES BUT NOT WATER BEVERAGES PICK YOUR BATTLES
SO THE GREAT BARRIER REEF ISN'T TOTALLY F AKED
GO MEDINA LAB
SO THEY JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TRUMP TAKES OFFICE ON JANUARY
CAN WE GLUE OBAMA TO THE WHITE HOUSE FORCING HIM TO BE PRESIDENT FOR A THIRD TERM
GOOD
AND TRUMP WILL START IT BACK UP ON JANUARY SHM THE ERA OF GENTLEMEN PRESIDENTS IS OFFICIALLY OVER
REMOVED
BECAUSE

SUCH A SHIT CLICKBAIT ARTICLE
LIKEWISE IN HER STUDY CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS TENDED TO EXHIBIT A LOW CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY BORNE OUT BY POSITIVE RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUCH AS OTHER PEOPLE S MISFORTUNES DO NOT USUALLY DISTURB ME

OR THE TORTOISE LAYS ON ITS BACK ITS BELLY BAKING IN THE HOT SUN BEATING ITS LEGS TRYING TO TURN ITSELF OVER BUT IT CAN'T NOT WITHOUT YOUR HELP BUT YOU'RE NOT HELPING WHY IS THAT

EDIT BUT SERIOUSLY HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE

IN ORDER TO APPEAL TO THOSE WHO DENY CLIMATE CHANGE DISCUSSIONS SHOULD FOCUS ON CONVINCING PEOPLE TO TAKE ON BEHAVIORS THAT WOULD HELP PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT TRYING TO CONVINCE THEM TO BECOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS THE RENEWABLE ENERGY ECONOMY IS A GREAT EXAMPLE ARGUING THAT INNOVATION IN ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES WOULD LEAD TO THE CREATION OF JOBS DOES NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE CONVINCING SOMEONE OF THE HARMFUL IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

DIDN'T WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THOUGH
INVOLVES A TWO BY FOUR
TIL CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS ARE BY NATURE IGNORANT ASSHOLES
IN THE US ENVIRONMENT IS TYPICALLY SEEN AS A LIBERAL CONCERN WITH CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND GREEN ENERGY POLICY ORIGINATING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND ITS VOTERS THAT LEADS MEMBERS OF THE RIGHT TO PUSH BACK FOR POLITICAL REASONS REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE ACTUAL ISSUES

THAT'S ABSOLUTELY INSANE IF THIS IS TRUE PEOPLE ARE LEGITIMATELY STUPID IN THIS COUNTRY WE DON'T NEED A ELECTORAL SYSTEM WE NEED TO GET RID OF PARTIES ALL TOGETHER
RIANE EISLER EXPLAINS PARTNERSHIP CULTURE BASED ON EGALITARIAN COOPERATION WHICH SEES POWER AS CREATING AND BUILDING IT'S OUR ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT DOMINATOR CULTURE WHICH IS HIERARCHICAL AND COERCIVE WHICH SEES POWER AS VIOLENCE IN DOMINATOR CULTURE THE ENVIRONMENT IS JUST FOR EXPLOITATION ESPECIALLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ELITES ONLY PARTNERSHIP WILL ALLOW US TO SEE OURSELVES AS PARTNERS WITH NATURE RATHER THAN RULERS


WHO WANTS THIS SHIT ANYMORE
LIKE NAH BRO THAT'S YOU

DIDN'T READ THE ARTICLE YET BUT CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT'S HOW IT GOES IN A NUTSHELL
THERE ARE MUCH MORE DIRECT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

TRUMP DISCLOSED MILLION TO BILLION IN INVESTMENTS GOING TO ENERGY TRANSFER PARTNERS A COMPANY THAT IS THE PRIMARY BUILDER OF THE MILE PIPELINE WHICH WHEN FINISHED WOULD RUN FROM NORTH DAKOTA TO ILLINOIS

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM ALSO REVEALS THAT HE HAD BETWEEN TO IN COMPANY PHILLIPS WHICH HAS PURCHASED AN OWNERSHIP STAKE IN THE PIPELINE THAT IS EQUAL TO ONE-QUARTER OF ITS VALUE ONCE IT IS COMPLETED


HAROLD HAMM ENERGY ADVISOR WHO MADE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THROUGH CONTINENTAL RESOURCES THE BIGGEST BRACKING COMPANY IN THE U SOUTH IS ALSO A STAKEHOLDER IN THE PIPELINE
THIS IS AWESOME
THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY LEMME THIS HEADLINE TRUMP IS POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PLANET AND WE SHOULD BE FREAKING OUT ABOUT IT

PLEASE CONSIDER DONATIONS OR VOLUNTEER WORK WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT THEY NEED OUR HELP NOW MORE THAN EVER AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE INDIVIDUAL MEASURES WE CAN TAKE ELIMINATING OR SIMPLY REDUCING YOUR CONSUMPTION OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS CAN HAVE A CONSIDERABLE IMPACT
YOU DON'T SAY
SOME WILL FIGHT SOME WILL HELP SOME WILL DO NOTHING AND SOME WILL SABOTAGE
SOME WILL DIE OTHERS WILL SURVIVE SOME WILL DIE FIGHTING AND OTHERS WILL SURVIVE WITHOUT EFFORT
GOD WHY ARE PEOPLE WHO CLAIM TO LOVE THE PLANET SO FUCKING MORBID AND PESSIMISTIC

THEY ALSO HAVE ZERO FAITH IN LIFE AND PLANETARY SYSTEMS TO PREVAIL
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SHOULD CONSIDER A BOTTOM UP TARIFF ON THE US UNDER TRUMP DON'T BUY AMERICAN UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT THE COMPANY YOU'RE PATRONIZING CARES ABOUT THE CLIMATE
INTERESTING THAT FOCUS ON THE MISSISSIPPI I WAS THINKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF THE HUGE AMOUNT OF DEAD WATER IN SW MINNESOTA DUE TO THE SAME CAUSE
THIS IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM
I WISH EVERY CHILD COULD BE SCREENED WITH ALL THE OLD PIPES IN THE WORLD AND THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT ACTION THE WORLD SHOULD KNOW WHAT LEVELS WE ARE CONSUMING
WELL WE HAVE MESSED UP THE ENVIRONMENT SO LONG THAT NOW IT SURELY IS A SECURITY THREAT

MOST OF THE WAR CONFLICT ZONES IN THE WORLD ARE THE AREAS WHICH ARE THE MOST HARD HIT BY DROUGHT
IT'S A BAD SIGN WHEN THE MILITARY IS MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT
REMEMBER WHEN BERNIE SAID CLIMATE CHANGE WAS A FACTOR IN THE FORMING OF ISIS AND SAID IT'S A SECURITY THREAT AND EVERYONE LAUGHED AND CALLED HIM CRAZY
DAMN HIPPIE MILIARY
I FIND IT ABSOLUTELY AMAZING HOW PEOPLE CONTINUE TO TRY TO TALK SENSE TO A SENSELESS MANUAL YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING YOU HAVE WAY MORE PATIENCE AND TOLERANCE THAN I WILL EVER HAVE I HOPE IT WORKS
I DONT UNDERSTAND TRUMP BELIEVES GLOBAL WARMING IS A CHINESE HOAX
BY REDUCING THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT THEY BECOME A COMBATANT IN THE WAR ON RISING GLOBAL TEMPERATURES MILITARY LEADERS SAY

CRINGE
SENT DONALD TRUMP S TRANSITION TEAM A BRIEFING BOOK

WELL THAT'S A REAL LIFE TL R IF I'VE EVER SEEN ONE
IF HE DOESN'T SEE IT AS A MILITARY THREAT THEN WE NEED A MILITARY COUPE BECAUSE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS IGNORANT OF THE DANGER AND PUTS THE ENTIRE NATION IF NOT THE WORLD INTO MORTAL PERIL
WELL WHATEVER WORKS
I'M GONNA GUESS TRUMP WILL DO THE SAME THING THAT BUSH DID WHEN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS TOLD HIM THE IRAQ WAR WOULD COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND REQUIRE OVER TROOPS TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE SAY UR DUM
YOU CAN'T CONVINCE THIS MAN OF ANYTHING HE IS TREATING THE COUNTRY LIKE A BUSINESS LITERALLY THE WORST DECISION WE COULD HAVE MADE IN THE SITUATION WE ARE IN
BUT THAT KIND OF THREAT DOESN'T GIVE HIS SUPPORTERS ANYONE TO HATE
GOOD THING HE KNOWS MORE THAN THE GENERALS
YES WAR ON GLOBAL WARMING
THE NEED TO DO MORE THAN SEND HIM A BRIEFING BOOK THE PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT IS AND THESE GUYS NEED TO SIT TRUMP THE HELL DOWN AND MAKE HIM READ IT
IN THEIR DEFENSE THEY PROBABLY ALSO SEE HIS TWITTER FEED APPOINTEES UNPREPAREDNESS AND OVERALL BULL IN A FUCKING CHINA SHOP DEMEANOR ALSO HIGH ON THE LIST OF MILITARY THREATS
WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL OBAMA THIS WHY DON'T THEY TELL CONGRESS THIS
I WOULD REALLY PREFER THE MILITARY FIND A SOLUTION TO THE KILLINGS IN THE MIDDLE EASTERN
OLD NEWS
MEANWHILE YOU LOT ARE SITTING ON YOUR HANDS WHILE ISIS TERRORIZES EUROPE AND ARE MAKING THREATS AGAINST THE US SAYING IT WILL HAPPEN SOON ALL UPSET ABOUT WHAT TRUMP SAYS HE DOES WANT TO DO ABOUT PROTECTING THE US BUT YOURE FOCUSED ON SOMETHING THAT WE CANT REALLY CONTROL BECAUSE THE ATMOSPHERE IS EVERY COUNTRIES ATMOSPHERE AND 2 IS SOMETHING THAT WE MAY NOT SEE CONSEQUENCES OF FOR DECADES BUT ISIS IS ATTACKING OTHER COUNTRIES NOW AND IS THREATENING TO ATTACK THE US SOON EVEN ON A SMALLER SCALE IF WE HAVE ANOTHER OF ANY TYPE OUR ECONOMY PROBABLY WONT HOLD UP THE ECONOMY TOOK A HUGE HIT BECAUSE OF BUT WAS MUCH STRONGER THAN IT IS NOW SO IT WOULD PROBABLY BE CATASTROPHIC TODAY SO THERE WONT BE MUCH OF A NATION TO KEEP SECURE ALL THIS WHILE THE LEFT IS INCITING RIOTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SEEMINGLY PUSHING FOR ANOTHER CIVIL WAR WHICH NO DOUBT WILL MAKE ISIS EVEN MORE EMBOLDENED AND EAGER TO CREATE CHAOS DESTRUCTION AND AN ECONOMIC CRISIS LET'S FOCUS ON THE FAR MORE IMMEDIATE THREAT FOR A COUPLE YEARS THEN MAYBE WE CAN GET BACK TO ENVIRONMENTALISM
HERE'S THE WIKI LINK FOR MORE INFO ABOUT THE PROJECT I BELIEVE IT'S A GREAT STEP TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT
WAT
VIEW ON THE ENVIRONMENT IS THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE LEFT AFTER BUSINESS HE DOESN'T GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
MAYBE WE COULD START THINKING ABOUT REFORMS THAT TAKE SCIENCE AND FACT FINDING OUT OF THE HANDS OF POLITICIANS IS THAT TOO OUT OF THE BOX BECAUSE TAKING THAT STEP WOULD OPEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL
LIKE NOT POSSESSING ANY DEGREE IN ANY OF THE SCIENCES
LET HIM PROVE THAT PESTICIDES ARE BAD JUST FEED HIM PESTICIDES FOR A WEEK
CAN WE IMPEACH THIS NEW EPA GUY IF HE GETS ELECTED PESTICIDES ARE BAD FOR YOU
SO IF HE POISONS ME WITH HIGH LEVELS OF PESTICIDES I CAN DO THE SAME TO HIM
IS THAT GUY REALLY A CLIMATE CHANGE DENIER OR DID HE JUST CONTINUE TO BE A FAMOUS CLIMATE CHANGE DENIER BECAUSE COMPANIES KEPT GIVING HIM MONEY TO CONTINUE TO DENY CLIMATE CHANGE LOUDLY WHAT LITTLE I'VE READ ABOUT HIM HAS BEEN HORRIFYING

I'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION BEFORE BUT NEVER GOT AN ANSWER THIS DIPSHIT EARNED A LIVING BY BELITTLING AND ACCUSING SCIENTISTS OF BEING CRAZY
IF IT KILLS PESTS IT WILL KILL YOU
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE RIGHT I MEAN JUST ABOUT EVERY NEWS SITE IS POSTING ARTICLES ABOUT HOW WE'VE GONE PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN
THIS SHOULD BE ON R NOTTHEONION
SO WHO'S BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE WELLS DOES ANYONE GET FINED OR HAVE TO PAY DAMAGES
LETS SEE THE VIDEO
HYPOCRISY
I BELIEVE TRUMP WILL HAVE A HARDER TIME ELIMINATING LEGISLATION THAN HE THINKS HE COULD BE FIGHTING MOST OF TERM JUST FOR A FEW BILLS TO BE REVERSED LET ALONE ALL OF THEM
THIS WHERE BYPASSING CONGRESS WILL COME HOME TO ROOST IT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL THE SHOE IS ON THE OTHER FOOT
THIS PETITION HAS BEEN REMOVED
SURPRISING BUT DEFINITELY A GOOD ENDORSEMENT CONSERVATIVE GUY BODY BUILDER MANLY DUDE SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE

IF YOU REALLY THOUGHT HE GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
OH I HADN'T THOUGHT ON HIM IN A WHILE CAN WE GET THIS GUY A MEETING WITH TRUMP ASAP
A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE AND TOO LITTLE BETTER THING TO DO IS TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN TO AVOID THEM SUFFERING FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DEATH OF THE BIOSPHERE AS A RESULT OF OUR CARLIST CULTURE
GIVING UP THIS THAT OR THE OTHER IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE IF YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT IS GREATER THAN WHAT'S SUSTAINABLE HIS ISN'T IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SELF DELUDED BULLSHIT AND PSYCHOPATHY I'LL GIVE HIM AND OTHERS LIKE HIM EG DICAPRIO KLEIN ATAL THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND ASSUME IT'S THE LATTER

LOOK TO YOUR TOTAL EMISSIONS OUTPUT IT'S NEARLY GUARANTEED TO BE WELL CORRELATED TO YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET IT UNDER T PER ANNUM ANY MORE THAN THAT AND YOU'RE THE PROBLEM

YES MINE IS AT ABOUT T HAD A VASECTOMY AND I ONLY VOTE GREEN NO THE GREENS ARE NOT THE ANSWER BUT THEY ARE A SMALL STEP IN MOVING THE RIGHT WAY EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST MORE OF THE SAME BULLSHIT
HE MUST EAT A SHIPLOAD OF MEAT THEN
I IMAGINE HE MUST HAVE BEEN EATING A LOT OF MEAT IF HIS PERSONAL SACRIFICE IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO BENEFIT HUMANITY
I JUST SAW THE IVORY GAME ON NETFLIX I WAS SO FILLED WITH RAGE WILD CONSERVATION SOCIETY AND OTHERS LIKE IT REALLY DESERVE ALL THE SUPPORT AND HELP THEY CAN GET

SERIOUSLY PEOPLE WATCH IT OUTSTANDING DOCUMENTARY

EDIT SEEMS PEOPLE HATE ELEPHANTS SINCE I'M GETTING DOWNVOTED YEAH FUCK THEM AND LET THEM DIE OUT IN LESS THAN YEARS THE POPULATION HAS GONE FROM OVER TO LESS THAN WHO CARES RIGHT
I FEEL LIKE HE WOULD CONSIDERABLY EAT MORE MEAT THAN THE AVERAGE HUMAN PER SITTING WHICH IS WHY TOO MUCH MEAT CAN BE DAMAGING TO YOUR HEALTH

OTHERWISE I WOULD ASSUME THAT PORTION CONTROL FOR YOUR MEAT INTAKE WOULD BE NORMAL AND HEALTHY

I AM JUST NOT THERE YET IN MY LIFE TO GIVE UP MEAT EVEN BROCCOLI SCREAMS WHEN YOU RIP IT FROM THE GROUND
GUY HAS NO CLUE ABOUT US POLITICS REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF CLIMATE CHANGE DENIAL PERIOD
QUICK SURVEY TO HELP A DESIGN PROJECT
I THINK PLAIN DENIAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND LUDICROUS POLICIES WILL WAKE UP THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT WHAT HE'S PLANNING ON DOING WILL NULLIFY THE PROGRESS THE ENTIRE WORLD HAS MADE ALREADY I BELIEVE CHINA HAS VOWED TO INVEST DOUBLE THE MONEY INTO RENEWABLE JUST IN SPITE OF TRUMP HOPEFULLY STUPIDITY AND THE STUPIDITY OF HIS EPA TRANSITION POSITION WILL WAKE UP THE SLEEPING GIANT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT
THE MEDIA WHOSE MEDIA WE DEFINITELY AREN'T TALKING ABOUT MY TRUMPKIN UNCLE'S MEDIA WHICH RANGE ALL THE WAY FROM FOX NEWS TO LIMBAUGH TO BREITBART ALONG WITH WHATEVER HE GETS ON HIS FACEBOOK FEED FROM HIS FRIENDS

THE MEDIA ARE THE CENTRAL PROBLEM WE FACE BECAUSE EVERYONE NOW HAS THEIR OWN LITTLE MEDIA ENVELOPE TO SNUGGLE UP IN SAFE FROM DISAGREEABLE FACTS
THE FAILURE OF THE MEDIA WAS TO NOT ONLY TO PROCLAIM CLINTON WOULD WIN IN A LANDSLIDE BUT TO CRY WHEN TRUMP WON NOT ONLY HAS IT BEEN MADE BLATANTLY CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT INDEPENDENT JOURNALISM BUT THEY CONTINUE TO FEED THE DIVIDE INSTEAD OF BRIDGING IT TO BE A CHANGE AGENT YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE REAL REASONS WHY MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR TRUMP INSTEAD OF DENIGRATING THEM
WHY WOULD THE MEDIA BE SETTING AN AGENDA ISN'T THAT THE JOB OF THE PEOPLE AND THE MEDIA SHOULD JUST REPORT ON IT IF IT HAPPENS
I THINK CLIMATE DENIERS WILL SOON BE A SMALL MINORITY YES THE GROUP SEEMS LOUD NOW BUT REMEMBER THERE IS STILL A PROBATION PARTY AND IT USED TO BE LOUD ENOUGH TO GET AMENDMENTS PASSED DENIERS WILL BE IN THE SAME BOAT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WITH NO ONE LISTENING

RISE IN GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS SLOWS


I AM A BOTANY I DELETE MY NEGATIVE COMMENTS CONTACT CODE FAQ
THE TROUBLE IS THE CARBON POLLUTION ISSUE REVOLVES AROUND PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN CITIES
THEY'VE GOT TWO MONTHS BEFORE TRUMP APPROVES IT SO THEY CAN'T WAIT 2 YEARS LIKE THEY DID WHEN THE PROJECT STARTED
SAD TRUTH IS THAT THIS PIPELINE WILL BE FINISHED AT SOME POINT ESPECIALLY WITH TRUMP AS PRESIDENT BUT THIS STATEMENT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD FIND AN ALTERNATE ROUTE THAT DOESN'T ENDANGER THE STANDING ROCK SIOUX TRIBE
CALL ME SKEPTICAL BUT I FORESEE UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MASSIVE LAYOFFS AND OR REDEPLOYMENT OF CORPS OF ENGINEER WORKERS UNTIL THEY FIND SOMEONE TO MOVE IT FORWARD JUST LIKE CHENEY HAD TO KEEP LOOKING THROUGH DOJ LAWYERS UNTIL THEY FINALLY FOUND AN UNETHICAL LAWYER TO APPROVE WATER BOARDING
IF THEY KNOW THEY DON'T WANT IT THERE WHAT'S THERE TO CONSULT ABOUT
REALLY REALLY THEY SAID THAT ONCE ALREADY AND ONLY PSYCHED US OUT
DOES ANYONE HAVE A RELIABLE SOURCE FOR THIS
WORKS FOR THE PRESIDENT ELECT DOES IT NOT
I DON'T GET IT ISN'T THERE ALREADY A PIPELINE THERE
THIS WILL NOT STOP THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PIPELINE BEST CASE SCENARIO THE RIVER CROSSING LOCATION CHANGES MIGHT SAVE STANDING WATER BUT THERE'S MILLION OTHER PEOPLE DOWNSTREAM WHO RELY ON THIS WATER I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY JUST MOVED THE PROTEST CAMP TO THE NEXT CROSSING SITE IN THAT SCENARIO THIS MOVEMENT IS ALREADY MUCH LARGER THAN APL

MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS DELAY IS NOT A MEANINGFUL VICTORY IN FACT IT PLAYS RIGHT INTO STRATEGY THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO BULLDOZE AND BUILD THE PIPELINE REGARDLESS OF THE STATUS OF THE EASEMENT DESTROYING SACRED LAND AND BURIAL SITES IN THE PROCESS KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS LAND DESIGNATED TO THE TRIBE IN THE TREATY OF LARAMIE EVERY DAY THEY BULLDOZE DESTROYS CULTURAL EVIDENCE I E ARTIFACTS AND MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THAT THE ARMY CORPS WILL FIND REASON TO STOP CONSTRUCTION

TODAY WAS A HUGE EFFORT BUT WE MUST CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVE TO RESIST APL AND OTHER OIL PIPELINES ITS ECONOMICALLY ASININE AND MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE THAT WE ARE INVESTING SO HEAVILY IN NEW FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE YES THERE MUST BE A TRANSITION PERIOD BECAUSE WE CAN'T GO RENEWABLE OVERNIGHT BUT WE'LL NEVER TRANSITION IF WE CONTINUE TO INVEST HEAVILY IN FOSSIL FUELS WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO POWER THE U SOUTH RENEWABLY WHICH WOULD BE BETTER FOR EVERYONE MORE JOBS BETTER HEALTH MORE EFFICIENCY
DIDN'T THEY TRY AND CONSULT THEM ORIGINALLY BUT THEY NEVER WENT TO ANY OF THE MEETINGS
DELETED
BOOOOOO
I DISAGREE ARE WE DONE NOW
GREAT JOB THEY STOPPED US FROM GETTING CHEAPER OIL
CHINA IS QUICKLY BECOMING THE WORLD LEADER IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE FIGHT THEY STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO TO GO BUT THE EFFORT IS OUTSTANDING
THESE FOLKS HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE I PERSONALLY KNOW TWO PEOPLE THAT WORKED IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY OVER THE LAST DECADE AND THEY LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY DRILLED SO MUCH THEY DROVE THE COST OF GAS DOWN SO LOW THAT IT WAS NO LONGER ECONOMICALLY VIABLE TO PURSUE IT THEY LOST THEIR JOBS ANOTHER OIL AND GAS BOOM AND BUST
IT WOULD BE IF TRUMP OFFERED MUST A TYPE POSITION BOTH WANT TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON IMPORTED ENERGY BOTH WANT TO INCREASE DOMESTIC JOBS BOTH ARE NOT AFRAID TO SHAKE THINGS UP BOTH HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN SPACE EXPLORATION
WHILE I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PETITION WILL DO AS NEITHER PARTIES REALLY NEED TO DO ANYTHING I THINK IF ENOUGH MOMENTUM IS GAINED ON THIS MOVEMENT THOUGH SOME CHANGE CAN BE MADE

IF TRUMP IS TO LOOK AT IT FROM A BUSINESS SIDE IT'S DEFINITELY A GREAT DEAL FOR HIM AS TESLA COULD CREATE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES WHILE MAINTAINING A GREENER STANDARD
FIGHTING CULT OF PERSONALITY WITH CULT OF PERSONALITY IS NEVER THE ANSWER GRASSROOTS CHANGE IS THE ONLY WAY
MORE THAN PEOPLE ARE IDIOT FANBOYS
THEY'RE LOOKING INTO IT
WHY NOT JUST LINK DIRECTLY TO THE ARTICLES THIS ONE IS BASED ON THIS IS OLD NEWS AND HE NEVER ACTUALLY USED THE WORD SOCIALISM I DO BELIEVE WE NEED SOCIALISM TO SAVE THE PLANET BUT WHAT GATES IS SUGGESTING IS ONLY SOCIALISM IN THE SENSE THAT IT REQUIRES GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT AND INTERVENTION RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE FREE MARKET TO FIX EVERYTHING HE'S NOT SUGGESTING ENDING PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
I DIDN'T SEE ANY SOCIALISM MENTIONED IN NEITHER THE QUOTES USED IN THE LINKED ARTICLE NOR THE ARTICLE FROM THE ATLANTIC SO I DON'T SEE WHY THEY WENT WITH THAT PARTICULAR TITLE
JUST PR HERE'S BILL ENJOYING SOCIALISM IN CANNES
SAYS THE RICHEST MAN ON THE PLANET
BILL WAS RUTHLESS IN GAINING HIS RICHES BURYING BOTH RICH AND POOR ALIKE IF HE IS REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT SOCIALISM HE SHOULD GIVE ALL HIS MONEY AWAY NOW FORGET ABOUT WAITING UNTIL LATER HE COULD JUST GIVE IT AWAY TO THE RAINFOREST COUNTRIES SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO SEND THEIR POOR TO SETTLE IN THE RAINFOREST AND CHOP DOWN TREES
AFTER SENDING TONS OF TO AFRICA
SAYS MR CORPORATE MONOPOLY
BERNIE WPA
OK BILLY YOU FIRST
SAYS THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD HOS GONNA GIVE HIS MONEY AWAY SOMEDAY
THAT'S LIKE HAVING HITLER CALLING FOR PEACE LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING WTF
MEET THE DECLINE
DUH
OBAMA IN HIS CAMPAIGNING OFFERED A MESSAGE THAT WE SHOULD EMBRACE CHANGE AND THIS PLAN IS CERTAINLY AN EXAMPLE OF THAT SORT OF PROGRESSIVE CHANGE THAT BRINGS ABOUT NEW JOBS

CAMPAIGN MESSAGE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN MAKES VERY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE THE UNITED STATES BACK TO HOW IT WAS IN THE PAST HIS SUGGESTIONS OF REPEALING TRADE AGREEMENTS WILL SERVE THE PURPOSE OF BRINGING BACK MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT EXISTED HERE IN THE PAST BUT COULD BE MORE EFFICIENTLY DONE ELSEWHERE AND ELIMINATING MANY OF THE NEW JOBS THAT WILL SUFFER AS A RESULT OF THE BARRIERS TO TRADE

WE SHOULD BE EMBRACING THIS SORT OF PROGRESS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PULL BACK DECADES OF ADVANCEMENT
DELETED
AN IDIOT LIKE THIS IN POWER MAY ACTUALLY SPUR SOME DRASTIC CHANGES
AND NEITHER IS NUCLEAR HOPEFULLY
IF YOU THINK THAT'LL MATTER TO THE RIGHTWING ELITE YOU WERE DEFINITELY BORN YESTERDAY ALL THREE BRANCHES WITH SOME OF THE MOST UNFETTERED REPRESENTATIVES EVER GAME OVER
PLAN B
WE AREN'T EVEN FUNDING MAKING MARS ANYTHING A FEW PRIVATE ENTERPRISES MAY BE BUT WE AREN'T

ANYWAY HERE'S THE CASE FOR ACTUALLY FUNDING MAKING MARS HABITABLE ON PUBLIC FUNDING

DUE TO THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN TAKE WITH YOU ON MARS IT WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE TO DEVELOP REALLY EFFICIENT FOOD PRODUCTION METHODS

METHODS SUCH AS AQUAPONIC VERTICAL FARMING AND CULTURED TISSUE MEAT CAN BE POWERED BY RENEWABLE AND USE ELECTRICITY AS THEIR MAIN INPUT

THESE PROCESSES CAN BE FULLY DECENTRALIZED AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR TRANSPORTATION OF GOODS MAKING OUR FOOD INFRASTRUCTURE MORE STREAMLINED AND LESS DEPENDANT ON FOSSIL FUELS FERTILIZERS AND SPACE GRASSLANDS FOR GRAZING ETC

I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A WHILE NOW THAT INEFFICIENCY AND BAD LOGISTICS COUPLED WITH A RIDICULOUS GLOBAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR FOOD TO GO TO WASTE TO INCREASE MARKET VALUE ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THAT THE MEANS TO SURVIVE ON MARS WHICH ARE BASED ON EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY ARE ALSO THE MEANS TO SURVIVE ON EARTH

THAT SAID PLAN B IS ENOUGH OF A REASON FOR ME
DUDES GOT 2 MONTHS LEFT TO MAKE STUFF THE GOP CAN'T IMMEDIATELY DESTROY GOOD FOR HIM FOR TRYING
WHEW KEEP GOING
IS NITROGEN DIOXIDE AND NOX IS BOTH AND NO NITRIC ACID

THOSE CUBERS ARE PROBABLY NOT MILLIGRAM BUT MICROGRAM AND STILL THROUGH THE ROOF FOR A RESIDENTIAL STREET IF THIS WERE IN THE EU YOU COULD SUE THE CITY DEMANDING MEASURES TO REDUCE THE POLLUTION TO AN AVERAGE VON MICROGRAM NOX BY WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY

NITROGEN OXIDES CAN CAUSE OR WORSEN RESPIRATORY AND HEART PROBLEMS
THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO TRUMP IS PLANNING AHEAD WHAT WOULD A SANE SOCIETY INVEST IN FOR ITS SURVIVAL AND GENERAL WELL-BEING EVERYONE AGREES WE NEED TO MODERNIZE AND UPGRADE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IF DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS BOTH TO FORESTALL THE MOST SEVERE IMPACTS AND TO ADAPT TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE WE CANNOT STOP OUR INVESTMENTS WILL BE WASTED AND OUR NEEDS UNMET HEED THE U SOUTH ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF USAC CIVIL WORKS WATER RESOURCES INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROGRAMS EXISTING AND PROPOSED COULD BE AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE THIS AFFECTS DESIGN AND OPERATIONAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RESOURCE SUPPLIES SYSTEM DEMANDS OR PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS BOTH DROUGHTS AND FLOODS CAN AFFECT THE OPERATIONS OF THESE PROJECTS NUMEROUS REGULATORY DECISIONS MADE BY USAC WILL NEED TO BE INFORMED BY CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION CONSIDERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE U SOUTH ESPECIALLY IN WESTERN STATES HETP
OME THIS WOMAN SHOULDN'T BE ENTRUSTED WITH A PLASTIC BAG LET ALONE ANY PART OF THIS COUNTRY

LIKE WHY HOW IS SHE EVEN STILL IN POLITICS ISN'T SHE LIKE MENTALLY INCAPABLE OF HANDLING THE THINKING PART OF THE JOB SERIOUSLY I WANNA KNOW HOW SHE DOES THIS AND STILL HAS THE BRAIN CAPACITY TO REMEMBER TO BREATHE ON TOP OF IT

TL R I DO NOT LIKE PALIN
STRONG SCIENCE BASED EDUCATION GOING THIS POSSIBLE CHOICE IS THE MOST BAFFLING FOR ME
RIGHT NOW WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD TIME FOR OBAMA TO USE HIS POWER UNDER THE ANTIQUITIES ACT AND DECLARE LARGE SWATHS OF THE US AS PROTECTED NATIONAL MONUMENTS
HALF-WIT THAT SPEWS WORD SALAD THIS IS NOT GOOD
THOSE COMMENTS ARE CANCER
SHE LIKES TO SHOOT WOLVES FROM A HELICOPTER DOESN'T SHE
THIS IS AWESOME

NOT JOKING
NEWS OUTLETS ARE REPORTING THAT WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENT EXCEPT FOR ONE SECTOR METHANE RECENTLY IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT IF WE FEED SEAWEED TO COWS WE CAN REDUCE THE METHANE THEY PRODUCE FROM

WE CAN HAVE THIS KNOWLEDGE BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING IF WE DO NOT USE IT PLEASE WE HAVE TO ACT FAST TO PURSUE ANY EDGE WE CAN ON CLIMATE CHANGE ESPECIALLY BEFORE THE EPA IS HEADED BY SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

IF EVERYONE ON THIS SIGNED THIS PETITION WE WOULD PASS THE GOAL REQUIRED FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO REVIEW THIS PETITION
NICE IDEA IF IT WOULD WORK BUT WHERE'S THE PROFIT IN THAT

WE ALL KNOW THAT WE'D BE BETTER OFF IF WE STOPPED USING FOR FARM ANIMALS TOO BUT UNDER THE LOGIC OF OUR CAPITALIST ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN

THUS THE ODDS OF THIS ACTUALLY OCCURRING IS NIL OR NEXT TO NOTHING AS NAOMI KLEIN HAS REPEATEDLY STRESSED EVEN WRITING A BOOK ON IT THE CHOICE IS CAPITALISM VERSUS THE CLIMATE

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE A LOT OF MINDS TO CHOOSE THE CLIMATE AND TO ABANDON CAPITALISM FOR PROPOSALS LIKE THIS TO WORK OR TO EVEN HAVE A CHANCE OF PASSING IN OUR WARPED POLITICAL SYSTEM
A FEW YEARS AGO I BOUGHT A QUARTER COW FROM A LOCAL FARMER WHO ADDED SEAWEED TO HER COWS FEED I SWEAR THIS MEAT WAS LIKE MAGIC IT HAD SOME SUPER NUTRIENT PROFILE THAT GAVE ME ENERGY LIKE NO OTHER MEAT I'VE EVER HAD IT MAY BE SOMETHING IN THE SEAWEED NOT SURE BUT THE MEAT WAS NUTRIENT DENSE
I'M ALL FOR THIS THOUGH I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO PETITION THE WHITE HOUSE FOR IT BECAUSE THE RESEARCH IS STILL ONGOING IN THIS NEWS ARTICLE IT MENTIONS THAT THEY STILL HAVE TO DO TESTS ON LIVING COWS AND DEVELOP A WAY TO CULTIVATE THIS SEAWEED FOR EASY HARVEST THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF OTHER REGULATIONS THEY WILL NEED TO COMPLY WITH AS WELL
I FIRMLY BELIEVE SCIENCE TO BE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO THE WORLD THAT I WANT MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN TO INHERIT I BELIEVE IT IS A WAY TO CONNECT DIFFERENT GROUPS NATIONS AND GENERATIONS

THROUGHOUT THE LAST FEW MONTHS I HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY PROUD OF DAN RATHER A VOICE OF REASON AMONGST THE DIN OF NOISE SUPER HAPPY TO SEE HIM CONTINUING TO FIGHT
YOU GOTTA PLAY THE GOP GAME BUSINESS BUY A PRIUS LEAF OR A TESLA GET SOLAR GET LEDS REDUCE DEMAND FOR FOSSIL FUELS AND WORK TO MAKE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY MARKET COMPETITIVE
OUT OF EVERY TERRIBLE THING TRUMP HAS SAID IT'S THE CLIMATE CHANGE DENIAL THAT IMPACTS EVERYONE NOT JUST WORKING CLASS FAMILIES WHO WILL BE SCREWED BECAUSE HE COULDN'T BRING THEIR JOBS BACK AS PROMISED OR SOMEONE HEALTHCARE PREMIUM BECOMES UNAFFORDABLE BECAUSE MEDICAID HAS BEEN DESTROYED BUT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD AND FUTURE GENERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY HIS MEASURES SOMEONE NEEDS TO KEEP HIM IN CHECK
TOO MANY PEOPLE TRUMP INCLUDED SUFFER FROM THE FALSE BELIEF THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A HEALTHY ECONOMY AND A HEALTH ENVIRONMENT IN FACT ECONOMISTS OVERWHELMINGLY AGREE THAT TAXING CARBON POLLUTION PAYS OFFICIAL

CLIMATE ECONOMISTS AGREE
RESOURCE ECONOMISTS AGREE
ECONOMISTS FROM ALL SECTORS AGREE
GREG MANKIE AGREES THERE'S AN ECONOMIC CONSENSUS
PAUL KRUGMAN AGREES THERE'S AN ECONOMIC CONSENSUS
LAURA TYSON AGREES THERE'S AN ECONOMIC CONSENSUS
JOHN COCHRANE AGREES THERE'S AN ECONOMIC CONSENSUS
THE ECONOMIST AGREES THERE'S AN ECONOMIC CONSENSUS
THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE AGREES THERE'S AN ECONOMIC CONSENSUS
THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE AGREES THERE'S AN ECONOMIC CONSENSUS


AND THE BIG KICKER FOR U SOUTH POLITICIANS MOST AMERICANS SUPPORT GOVERNMENT ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE REGARDLESS OF WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO

PLEASE HELP SPREAD THE WORD AND CORRECT THIS DAMAGING AND DANGEROUS MISCONCEPTION


IT IS DO OR DIE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT NOW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD US GOING DOWN THE RIGHT PATH BUT STILL NOT FAR ENOUGH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL BE PUSHING US IN REVERSE AND IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IF THAT HAPPENS THE EARTH IS PRETTY MUCH FUCKED THE US IS THE 2 EMITTER IN GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE WORLD WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO LOWER THAT AND NOW WE'LL PROBABLY INCREASE OUR EMISSIONS PEOPLE NEED TO START TALKING TO THEIR NEIGHBORS AND CONVINCING THEM THIS A REAL THREAT AND DON'T JUST SAVE IT FOR THE THANKSGIVING DINNER TABLE WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THIS EVERYDAY
DON'T TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE

TALK ABOUT HOW SOLAR AND WIND ARE BOOMING INDUSTRIES TALK ABOUT HOW SOLAR WIND AND BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES CAN MAKE PEOPLE GOBS OF MONEY TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH OF A DEMAND THERE IS FOR SOLAR WIND AND BATTERIES ABROAD TALK ABOUT HOW THERE'S A NEED FOR SOLAR WIND AND BATTERY TECHNOLOGY ABOUT HOW IT CAN CREATE REAL LASTING JOBS IN DEPRESSED AREAS TALK ABOUT HOW PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA WEST VIRGINIA MICHIGAN AND WITH DEEP INDUSTRIAL PERFECT FOR NEW FACTORIES TALK ABOUT HOW IT CAN MAKE US ENERGY INDEPENDENT TALK ABOUT HOW BUYING SOLAR DOESN'T CONTRIBUTE TO MONEY THAT GOES IN THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS TALK ABOUT HOW CHINA IS BEATING US IN THE RACE TO PRODUCE MORE SOLAR AND WIND TECH AND THEY'RE PRIMED TO KICK OUR ASS ON THE GLOBAL MARKET

THIS IS AN ECONOMIC FIGHT THAT THE US CAN WIN AND PEOPLE CAN PROFIT MASSIVELY OFF OF THE MIDDLE CLASS THE UPPER CLASS THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND THE LARGE BUSINESS OWNERS WANT TO BECOME FILTHY RICH SOLAR WIND AND BATTERIES ARE THE FUTURE EMERGING MARKETS AND THOSE WHO GET IN ON IT EARLY WILL GET SO DAMN RICHARD THIS CAN PUT AMERICANS BACK TO WORK IN A BIG WAY AND PUT A LOT OF MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS

LET'S NOT ONLY MAKE AMERICA MAKE AMERICANS RICHARD
IT'S KIND OF ASTONISHING SINCE SOME OF THE GOP BASE LIVES IN PLACES WHERE CLIMATE CHANGE WILL DO THE MOST HARM I MEAN LOOK AT FLORIDA HALF OF IT WILL BE UNDERWATER AT SOME POINT LOOK AT THE CURRENT DROUGHT AND WILDFIRES IN NOVEMBER IN ALABAMA

YES COUNT ME IN BUT LIKE MANY I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO OTHER THAN REPOST THIS TO FACEBOOK

WHAT ARE SOME CONCRETE STEPS SOMEONE COULD DO TO TAKE REAL ACTION ON THESE ISSUES
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE IN OTHER COUNTRIES
TRUMP MAY ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE BUT HE BELIEVES IN MONEY MORE

THE REASON THEY'RE EMBRACING CLIMATE DENIAL IS BECAUSE IT HELPS OIL GAS COAL PROFITS TO DO SO

HIS SUPPORTERS WILL BLINDLY LISTEN TO THE OFFICIAL STANCE ON CLIMATE WHICH IS WHY THEY PUT A DENIER IN THE ROLE
TRUMP SET UP A WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN EMAIL THEM AND LET THEM KNOW WHAT CHANGES YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE TAKE PLACE I ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO HAS AN IDEA TO WRITE THAT'S HOW CHANGE IS MADE MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD


SERIOUS QUESTION IS POPULATION GROWTH A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

FOLLOW UP QUESTION IF HUMANS STOPPED PROCREATING WOULD THAT STOP US FROM THIS DO OR DIE SITUATION
I'M SO FRUSTRATED SO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW WHO ARE EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT WHAT TRUMP IS OUTLINING WERE THE SAME PEOPLE SAYING THE CANDIDATES WERE EQUAL I DIDN'T LOVE CLINTON BUT THIS SOUTH PARK MENTALLY OF TURD VS DOUCHE SANDWICH WAS QUOTED SO OFTEN BY YOUNG ADULTS I KNOW THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE MOST AFFECTED BY THIS NOW SO MANY I KNOW WHO DIDN'T VOTE ARE COMPLAINING JUST GET OUT TO VOTE GODDAMMIT NOW WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT WHO IS ACTIVELY DISCUSSING DISMANTLING THE EPA I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST TYPED THAT I HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO CONVINCE MANY PEOPLE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND A HUGE ISSUE I FEEL LIKE I AM GOING OUT OF MY MIND WORRYING ABOUT THIS AND IT'S SO FRUSTRATING TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO TALK ABOUT THEY CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT TRUMP IS GOING TO DO HE HAS BEEN SAYING IT THE WHOLE TIME IT'S NO SURPRISE IT IS HONESTLY DEPRESSING ME IF DEMOCRATS TURN OUT STRONG IN WE CAN HOPEFULLY STOP THE REGRESSION THAT WILL DAMAGE OUR ENVIRONMENT BUT IF WE COULDN'T GET TURN OUT IN AN ELECTION YEAR ISN'T LOOKING GREAT

I WILL TRY TO WORK ON A COMMUNITY AND PERSONAL LEVEL BUT THAT ONLY DOES SO MUCH I AM SORRY FOR VENTING HERE BUT MY PEERS ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY WITH HOW MANY DIDN'T VOTE AND ARE NOW TELLING ME HOW BAD THIS ALL IS THESE PEOPLE WERE IN A SIGNIFICANT STATE THIS ELECTION I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE THIS FUCK THIS FUCK THIS SHIT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES WITH NO QUESTIONS IN THE DEBATES IT'S SO FUCKING BIZARRE I WANT TO WAKE UP AND IT ALL BE A DREAM BUT IT WON'T I'M SO DEPRESSED ABOUT IT I TRY TO AVOID ANY POLITICAL NEWS GODDAMMIT AMERICA I LOVE IT HERE I COULD MOVE BACK TO MY HOME COUNTRY BUT I BELIEVED IN THE PEOPLE TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE FEEL LIKE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS NATION CLIMATE CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT MEANS NOTHING THESE ISSUES WILL BE FUCKING MY KIDS AND MY GRANDKIDS OVER IT WILL BE FUCKING PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD WE SHOULD BE PLANTING TREES EVEN IF WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SIT IN THEIR SHADE BUT INSTEAD WE ARE DEPRIVING THEM OF EVEN HAVING TREES

AGAIN I AM SORRY FOR VENTING BUT IT IS SO DEPRESSING AND FRUSTRATING THE MORE I HEAR IF ANYONE HAS ANY FURTHER IDEAS FOR HOW I CAN PERSONALLY HELP FIGHT FOR THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE OTHER THAN RAISING AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGING ACTION WITH PEOPLE AROUND ME PLEASE LET ME KNOW AT LEAST I WILL FEEL A LITTLE LESS HELPLESS AND LIKE I AM CONTRIBUTING SOMEHOW TO HELP
I'LL JUST LEAVE THIS HERE

KILLIAN DOCUMENTS CONTROVERSY
WIKI

HE SHOULD NOT TALK SCIENCE WHEN HE COULDN'T FIGURER OUT THE MYSTERY OF THE TYPE SET
TRUMP BEING PRESIDENT IS WORKING OUT GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT SO FAR I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY DEMOCRATS SO CONCERNED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE

ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW WHAT BEEN GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL BERNIE BEING THE PRESIDENT
PRETTY SURE WE CAN JUST HOOK UP A DYNAMO TO EDWARD ROYAL CORPSE
ONE THING YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT TRUMP AND WHY HE WON OVER TRADITIONALLY BLUE STATES IS THAT HE APPEALED TO PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR MIDDLE CLASS STATUS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING ECONOMICALLY AT A PERSONAL LEVEL TO APPEAL TO TRUMP YOU HAVE TO APPEAL TO THOSE PEOPLE TO APPEAL TO THOSE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO HELP THEM ECONOMICALLY AT THE PERSONAL LEVEL


THE TROUBLE WITH TRYING TO APPEAL TO THESE PEOPLE ON ENVIRONMENT ISSUES IS THAT THEY HAVE HIGHER PRIORITIES THAT CURRENTLY ECLIPSE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND SO MANY ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS HAVE THE SIDE EFFECT OF HURTING THESE PEOPLE ECONOMICALLY


TO BUILD A BRIDGE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS HAVE TO HAVE REAL IMPACT TO THESE PEOPLE WITH THEIR JOBS AND HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE IF THOSE CONCERNED WITH THE ENVIRONMENT CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ELITIST MENTALITY THAT THEY SHOULD BE DICTATING TO THESE PEOPLE THERE WILL BE NO WAY TO CONVINCE TRUMP


I'VE BEEN WONDERING SINCE YOUNGER PEOPLE SEEM TO BE MUCH MORE WORRIED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IF THERE IS MORE WE CAN DO TO SEND A MESSAGE BESIDES JUST VOTING OR ACTIVISM AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL CLIMATE CHANGE IS A THREAT TO US AND ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN MOST OLDER INDIVIDUALS DENYING ITS EXISTENCE WON'T LIVE TO SEE THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD IT BE EFFECTIVE TO START A MOVEMENT TO SAY IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO RESPOND INEFFECTIVELY OR NOT AT ALL TO THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE THEN WE WON'T HAVE CHILDREN I FEEL LIKE EVEN IF ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE THREATENED TO DO THIS IT COULD GET A LOT OF ATTENTION EVEN CONSERVATIVES TYPICALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS HAVING ENOUGH CHILDREN TO REPLACE THEM
HOW IS HE CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF SCIENCE
WHAT WE DON'T NEED IS TO PASS HARSH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT STRANGLE OUR ENERGY INDUSTRY WHILE CHINA AND INDIA SIGN ONTO THE TREATIES AND THEN BASICALLY DO ZERO ENFORCEMENT WHILE SELLING US SOLAR PANELS MADE WITH RARE EARTH METALS AND PRODUCED BY SLAVE-LABOR WHAT WE DO NEED IS MORE SUPPORT FOR MOLTEN SALT REACTOR TECHNOLOGY FROM THOSE WHO CLAIM TO BE GREEN
WHEN THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON THE PLANET

THAT'S DEEP MANUAL
IT'S CLEAR THAT MOST OF YOU HAVE NO FAITH IN THE EARTH ITSELF MANKIND CAN DO IT'S BEST BUT THE EARTHMOTHER WILL PREVAIL

A DISGRACED JOURNALIST TOSSED OUT OF THE PROFESSION FOR FABRICATING EVIDENCE FOR ONE OF HIS STORIES IS THE PERFECT SPOKESMAN FOR CLIMATE SCIENCE
A GLOBAL REVOLUTION IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD SPREAD THE WORD PROTEST TAKE THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE TO THE STREETS WE ARE THIS PLANETS LAST HOPE THE FATE OF THE PLANET IS IN OUR HANDS WE CANNOT FAIL THERE IS NO SECOND CHANCE
WE AS A NATION ARE AT A CRITICAL POINT UNDER TUMP WE MAY BE LEFT IN THE DUST OF RAPIDLY TECHNOLOGICALLY INDUSTRIALIZING NATIONS HE REFUTES BASIC SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES AND HAS MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WITH THE SAME ANTIQUATED ARCHAIC THOUGHT PROCESSES IN WORLD YOU KEEP UP OR ARE LEFT BEHIND NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR OLD-SCHOOL NOSTALGIA AND AND NAÏVETÉ

INCLUDING JOURNALISM
STAND UP MARCH SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS NOBODY CARES AND IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE A LICK OF DIFFERENCE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP WE FINALLY HAVE A MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT DOES NOT BUY INTO GLOBAL WARMING BULLSHIT THIS IS A GREAT TIME FOR AMERICA

THE FUNDAMENTAL DIRECTION OF SCIENCE IS BEING CHANGED BACK TO A POINT WHERE IF YOU SAID A CERTAIN RACE HAS A PROBLEM IN ITS COMMUNITY YOU WOULDN'T BE LABELED AS A RACIST FOR SAYING SO NOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR THAT RACE AND EVERY OTHER RACE WITHOUT HAVING A LABEL ATTACHED TO YOU FOR CALLING AN INTERVENTION THE CHANGE TO GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT WHAT IS CHANGING SCIENCE
OHH DAN RATHER LICK MY CHIDE

WE HAVE MORE IMPORTANT SHIT TO WORRY ABOUT

GO GIVE A LECTURE TO CHINA YOU GERIATRIC FUCK
THE DISCUSSION IS FLAWED AND DISHONEST TO BEGIN WITH WHEN YOU ADDRESS THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ACCEPT OR DENY

NOONE THAT HAS LIVED LONGER THAN A YEAR AND HAS SEEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUMMER AND WINTER IS DENYING CLIMATE CHANGE

AND YES YOU CAN CARE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT ANTI POLLUTION WASTE DUMPING ETC EVEN IF YOU DOUBT CLAIMS THAT THE CLIMATE CHANGE WE SEE TODAY IS MAN MADE

BE HONEST WITH THE LABELING OF THE DISCUSSION WHICH IS IF CLIMATE CHANGE IS MAN MADE OR IF THERE IS MORE TO IT
OR STOP BEING SO ONE SIDED THAT YOU'D SACRIFICE HUNDREDS OF JOBS TO SAVE AN INSECT THE RIGHT CARES ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE JUST AS MUCH WE JUST AREN'T STUCK UP ASSHOLES ABOUT IT
AMAZING ARTICLE
IF POLITICS COULD BE ANY HELP AT ALL IN THE FIGHT FOR THE CLIMATE WE'D HAVE ALREADY SOLVED THE ISSUE OBAMA HAD YEARS TO DO IT BUT HE WAS TOO BUSY BEING GRIDLOCKED

INCREASING PUBLIC AWARENESS ON ACTUAL SOLUTIONS IS THE ONLY REAL WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME AND A PLACE FOR A GIGANTIC GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT IN OUR CENTURY THIS IS IT
DIDN'T THE SEE THE TROPICAL QUALIFIER AT FIRST AND WAS LIKE THERE ARE TALLER TREES THAN THAT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM GOOGLE

THE TALLEST TREES IN THE WORLD ARE REDWOODS SEQUOIA SEMPERVIRENT WHICH TOWER ABOVE THE GROUND IN CALIFORNIA THESE TREES CAN EASILY REACH HEIGHTS OF FEET METERS AMONG THE REDWOODS A TREE NAMED HYPERION DWARFS THEM ALL THE TREE WAS DISCOVERED IN AND IS FEET M TALL
COAL IS ALREADY BEING PHASED OUT IN FAVOR OF NATURAL GAS A Y O MINER MIGHT NOT WANT TO LEARN A NEW JOB BUT NEW INDUSTRY NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO COAL COUNTRY ANYWAY GOVERNMENT COULD BE USED TO HELP THAT TRANSITION BY DECLARING A SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT ZONE SUBSIDIZING JOB TRAINING ETC
2 CARBON MARKETS HOW BEIJING IS LEADING WITH
I LIKE THIS IDEA
THAT ALL DEPENDS I KNOW DOWN IN THE EAGLE FORD AREA OF TEXAS PEOPLE DESPERATELY NEED REGULATIONS TO SAVE THEM FROM THE ENORMOUS POLLUTION PUT OUT BY DRILLING OPERATIONS SOMETIMES REGULATIONS ARE FOR MAKING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD SO PRODUCERS AREN'T TEMPTED TO CUT CORNERS IN FAVOR OF COMPETITIVE EDGE
NATIONAL DEFENSE IS ANOTHER ANGLE THE US MILITARY RECOGNIZES GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE AS A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY
THANKS EVEN THOUGH I AM LEFTIST DUTCH WE WOULD CALL THE DES AND SOME CONSIDERATIONS SEEM ALIEN TO ME AND MAKE ME WANT TO ARGUE INSTEAD I HAVE COME TO THE REALISATION THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION WE NEED TO TAKE OPINIONS AND MOTIVATIONS AT FACE VALUE INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY TRY TO ARGUE OVER WHY THE OTHER GUY IS WRONG YOUR TEXT HELPS A LOT
HERE'S A SIMPLE SHORT ANSWER YOU TALK TO THEM ABOUT ECONOMIC INTEREST OF RENEWABLE OR THINGS THAT POLLUTE LESS THAN OTHERS AND CONVINCE THEM THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT AND THAT THEY DON'T WANT IT BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND BY THE TIME THEY ARE ALREADY USED TO RENEWABLE THEY WON'T NEED TO BE PERSUADED AT ALL
WASHINGTON STATE'S RECENT FAILURE TO PASS EXACTLY THE SORT OF CARBON TAX YOU ADVOCATE IS INSTRUCTIVE

GIVEN THE CHOICE CONSERVATIVES HAVE SIMPLY SHOWN TIME AND AGAIN THAT THEY'LL DRAW IN ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND THEN BITE OFF THE HAND EXTENDED TO THEM WORSE THE MERE EFFORT TO COMPROMISE SPLITS THE LEFT GUARANTEEING FAILURE VERY DIFFICULT
JOBS

THE WON'T BE ANGRY IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GIVES THEM A STABLE JOB WITH BENEFITS CALL IT THE GREEN CORPS AND MAKE IT PART OF THE MILITARY AND GIVE THEM JOBS CLEANING UP THIS COUNTRY AND BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE THE GOVERNMENT CAN AND SHOULD BE THE EMPLOYER OF LAST RESORT AND BECAUSE IT SPECIFICALLY IS TRYING TO SAVE US FROM CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD SEND CHECKS OR GIVE A JOB

UNILATERAL ACTION LIKE IT OR NOT A CARBON TAX PUTS THE US AT AN ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE JOBS MOVING TO CHINA IS THE REASON TRUMP WON IT WOULD BE MORE PALATABLE IF CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WERE ALSO REQUIRED TO TAX CARBON IT NEEDS TO BE CREDIBLE BINDING AGREEMENT NOT ABSTRACT PROMISES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE KEEP JOBS IN AMERICA MAKE CHINA PAY

THE CARBON TAX DOES NOT NECESSARILY PUT US IN A DISADVANTAGE IT REQUIRES COMPANIES TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND IF YOU WENT THE CONSERVATIVE ROUTE AND MADE IT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY SEE BRITISH COLOMBIA NOW IF YOU TOOK THE CARBON TAX PROCEEDS AND PLOWED IT INTO REBUILDING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE THEN YOU WOULD CREATE A BOOMING ECONOMY NOW WHY WOULD CHINA POLLUTE ITS OWN COUNTRY AND EXPLOIT ITS OWN CITIZENS JUST SO IT CAN ALSO PAY FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION THE CONSUMER HAS TO PAY THE CARBON TAX THAT MEANS US

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A THREAT TO THIS COUNTRY AND DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY WE SHOULDN'T NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS
2 ARE BASICALLY MORE TAXES SOUNDS LIKE MORE TAXES TOO OR SUBSIDIZATION THE REVENUE FOR WHICH HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE

SO A PLAN OF TAX TAX TAX AND TAX ISN'T GOING TO WIN OVER MANY REPUBLICANS
WHILE I DON'T AGREE WITH THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES FROM A SOFTWARE LEVEL IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE ANOTHER COMPANY MAKE THE MOVE TO CLEAN ENERGY
THEY'RE FALLING FOR THEIR OWN HOAX
CHINA IS GOING TO KICK OUR ASS IN CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY THEY'LL BE SELLING SOLUTIONS TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND WE'LL BE LEFT HOLDING LUMPS OF WORTHLESS COAL
THE ONLY RESPONSE POSSIBLE ARE PRIVATE FUNDS ALL THESE HOLLYWOOD STARS WITH THEIR MILLIONS AND OTHER BILLIONAIRES SHOULD JUST START BUYING LANDS AND FUND PRIVATE ECO RUN COMPANIES

LET ME GUESS DUDE WAS LATE TO WORK
IF THE OTHER NATIONS STICK WITH THE PARIS AGREEMENT I DON'T SEE WHY THEY SHOULDN'T THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WILL BE HURT BADLY SARKOZY ALREADY CALLED FOR A CARBON TAX FOR US IMPORTS OTHERS WILL FOLLOW AND A MAJOR RECESSION IS ALWAYS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

TRUMP WILL NOT DESTROY THE WORLD MAYBE THE CONTRARY BUT HE WILL PROBABLY DESTROY HIS OWN NATION AT LEAST FOR SOME YEARS OR DECADES
LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY DO UNITED STATES PLAYED A LARGER ROLE IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION THAN ANY COUNTRY ON EARTH AN INSANE AUTOCRATIC CLIMATE CHANGE DENIER JUST GOT ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS REPUBLICAN CONGRESS AND THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE SUPREME COURT FOR A GENERATION

YES IT'S POSSIBLE
YES BUT NOT BY PULLING OUT OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT HE CAN DESTROY THE WORLD BECAUSE THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY NO CHECKS AND BALANCES ON HIS USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS
A LOT OF CLIMATE ACTION STILL OCCURS AT THE CITY AND STATE LEVEL AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T AFFECT THE REGULATIONS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CONTROLS SO MANY STATE GOVERNMENTS AND THEY RARELY FACE SERIOUS OPPOSITION SINCE THE DNC ABANDONED STATE PARTIES A WHILE AGO IF THE DNC ADOPTS A STATE STRATEGY AGAIN UNDER ELLISON A LOT OF CHANGE COULD OCCUR IN STATE GOVERNMENTS
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UNDERESTIMATING TRUMP FOR A VERY LONG TIME EVEN BEFORE HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT HE ALWAYS SURPRISES IT'S STILL HAPPENING WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARD THINGS WE TELL OURSELVES SO WE CAN SLEEP WITHOUT TERROR IT'S WORSE THAN YOU THINK
NUMBER EVEN IF CLIMATE CHANGE WERE NOT REAL THE WORLD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT THAT FOSSIL FUELS ARE NOT THE WAY FORWARD
THEY CANT PREDICT HOW YOU WILL DIE YOU NEED TO TALE ACTION YOURSELF AND LIVE A LOW CARBON LIFESTYLE NO MEAT DRIVING FLYING CLEAN ELECTRICITY ONLY BUY USED PRODUCTS TRY TO EAT LOCAL
I WORKED 2 SEASONS OF TRAIL MAINTENANCE IN THE LAST DECADE BOTH OF WHICH INVOLVED SOME WORK ON SEPARATE SECTIONS OF THE PCT NORTH SOUTH OF YOSEMITE

I DON'T THINK I EVER NOTICED ANY TRASH OR LITTER ON THE PCT ITSELF CAMPGROUNDS THAT WERE 2 MILES OUT FROM THE FRONT COUNTRY RAILHEADS WERE SOMETIMES BAD THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF RANDOM PARTY BALLOONS THE BIG HELIUM FILLED FOIL ONES THAT FLOAT UP TO THE MOUNTAINS TO DIE BUT I ONLY EVER FOUND THEM FAR

KUDOS TO THIS GROUP HOPEFULLY THEY WILL INSPIRE PEOPLE TO BE MORE MINDFUL BUT IMHO PCT TRASH IN WILDERNESS AREAS IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO VOLUNTEER OR DONATE FIND A LOCAL TRAILS OR CONSERVATION GROUP AND ASK WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE FOR YOUR AREA
POSSIBLY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE AHEAD OF THE CURVE AS FOSSIL FUELS GET TAXED MORE OR BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS ONLY OF THE MARKET DOESN'T MEAN THAT ITS NOT THE FUTURE AUTOMAKERS PUSHING ELECTRIC CARS IS AN OVERALL GOOD THING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IT SHOWS THAT THEY BELIEVE IN RENEWABLE ENERGY BEING THE FUTURE AND HOPEFULLY PUSH OTHER CORPORATIONS IN THE SAME DIRECTION
SELF DRIVING CARS ARE ONLY OF THE MARKET WHY DO CAR MAKERS KEEP DOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON THIS FAILED IDEA
THEY'LL BE LUCKY TO SURVIVE THE NEXT AND THAT'S AFTER BILLIONS DIE OF WAR AND STARVATION IF WE MAKE IT TO YEARS IT WILL BE AT LEVEL OF TECH
TO BE HONEST I'M NOT REALLY SAD ABOUT HUMAN EXTINCTION LOL WE'VE ABUSED THIS PLANET FOR SO LONG AND DEVISED WAYS TO BOMB EACH OTHER AND THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT WE DESERVE IT
THIS IS A REAL SHAME

WE LOST OUT ON A CHANCE TO ENACT A POLICY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS WITHOUT HARMING THE ECONOMY
SO NATURE HAS EMBRACED THE MEME EH

I DON'T THINK CHANGING THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT CARBON IS GOING TO HAVE ANY IMPACT OUTSIDE OF THE BUBBLE OF SUPPORTERS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION
AM I ON R NOTTHEONION AGAIN

DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY SAY IT IS WHAT THEY DO
UH MAYBE JUST ON THE SURFACE
GOOD THIS SHOWS THEY AREN'T COMPLETELY EVIL AND ARE PROBABLY WILLING TO START REDUCING PRODUCTION AS LONG AS EVERYONE ELSE DOES THE SAME ALSO NOW THEY'RE ON RECORD AGAINST A 2 C RISE AT ALL COSTS SO WHEN THAT LINE IS CROSSED IN YEARS THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR BUSINESS MUST IMMEDIATELY BE SHUT DOWN COLD TURKEY
THIS IS SENSATIONALIST ENVIRONMENTALISTS NEED TO BE WELCOMING OF THE OTHER SIZE WE SHOULD NOT OSTRACIZE THEM TELLING OF THE US THEY ARE A PART OF THE MOST DANGEROUS ORGANIZATION IN WORLD HISTORY IS GOING TO MAKE THEM THINK WE ARE EXTREMISTS AND IDIOTS WHEN THEY BELONG TO THAT GROUP LET'S KEEP THE MESSAGE PRODUCTIVE AND WELCOMING
ALRIGHT EVERYBODY

HE WON'T DO IT

IT'S AN ELECTORAL BULLSHIT HE IS NOT EVEN NOMINATED CANDIDATE BY HIS PARRY YET AND NOT EVEN MONTHS AGO HE WAS BORDERLINE CLIMATE DENIER EVERYBODY CHILL OUT
FRANCE'S ACTUAL SITTING PRESIDENT IS

I GUESS HAVING A FORMER HEAD OF STATE PROPOSE SOLUTIONS WILL GAIN MORE VISIBILITY THAN AVERAGE CITIZENS JUST DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP TOO QUICKLY
THE ORIGINAL POST HAD K UPVOTES WHEN I POSTED THIS THE NEXT DAY WHEN I LOOKED IT WAS DOWN TO K WTF
I ALWAYS FEEL
I SHOULD GET A TAX BREAK FOR BEING VEGAN
WAIT UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BRIEFS TRUMP ON CLIMATE CHANGE
THIS IS A QUICK MINUTE PODCAST I DID THIS MORNING HOPE EVERYONE IS HAVING A NICE DAY
INDUSTRIAL CARBON EMISSIONS

EVERYTHING ELSE CONTINUED TO RISE

THIS IS NOT GOOD NEWS IT'S NOT EVEN NEWS AT ALL
WAIT UNTIL THEY RAMP UP WITH TRUMP
THIS IS MOSTLY DUE TO BRACKING MAKING NATURAL GAS CHEAPER THAN COAL NATURAL GAS EMITS THE OF COAL AND LESS OTHER POLLUTANTS SO WHILE IT MAY BE SOMEWHAT GOOD NEWS IT IS NOT ANY INDICATION THAT WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS ZERO EMISSIONS

ONE POSITIVE THAT PEOPLE DON'T DISCUSS MUCH IS THAT NATURAL GAS PLANTS CAN BE RAMPED UP AND DOWN FASTER THAN COAL WHICH MAKES THEM MORE SUITABLE TO BE MIXED WITH INTERMITTENT RENEWABLE ENERGY LIKE WIND AND SOLAR
SOME SMALL POSITIVE RESULTS BUT A LONG WAY TO GO
REALLY ONLY NOW THEY FIGURED THIS OUT LOL
WHY DID THIS GET REMOVED
SIGNED AND SHARED WITH FRIENDS
THIS SHOULD BE NEARER TO THE TOP OF R ENVIRONMENT EVEN THOUGH IT IS JUST A PETITION ANY FORM OF PARTICIPATION IS BETTER THAN NONE
THE UNITED STATES WILL LOSE ALL OF ITS SO-CALLED SOFT POWER AS THE WORLD S INDISPENSABLE NATION GOES ROGUE

OH NO WHAT WILL WE DO THE NEXT TIME WE NEED TO INVADE A COUNTRY THAT POSES NO THREAT TO US

THAT MEANS ANY EFFORT TRUMP MAKES TO KEEP HIS COMMITMENT TO BE TOUGH ON OTHER COUNTRIES ON TRADE WILL FIND ZERO SUPPORT AROUND THE WORLD

TRUMPS POINT IS THAT WE DON'T NEED INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENT WE NEED TO BACK OUT OF OUR COMMITMENTS

THE PERSON THAT WROTE THAT IS AS DUMB AS A FUCKING POST
HAVING ACTUALLY READ THIS STUDY THE HEADLINE IS AWFUL IT'S MOSTLY DAM EMISSIONS THAT WERE HIGHER THAN THOUGHT IRRIGATION FLOOD CONTROL ETC ARE WHERE THE BULK OF PREVIOUSLY UNMEASURED EMISSIONS ARE PRESENT

THIS IS ALSO MOSTLY MITIGATED WHEN CONSTRUCTING HYDRO DAMS IN RICH COUNTRIES BIOMASS IS REMOVED BEFORE AN AREA IS FLOODED THIS ISN'T TYPICALLY DONE WITH IRRIGATION FLOOD SYSTEMS
THIS IS CRAZY I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
IF IT CREATES CARBON THE IT MUST BE ELIMINATED AT ALL COST

WE CANNOT GAMBLE WITH THE FUTURE OF OUR PLANET WE MUST PETITION OUR GOVERNMENT TO STOP HYDROELECTRICITY

THE ROTTING VEGETATION IS A HARDER PROBLEM TO SOLVE I THINK OUR BEST BET IS TO ELIMINATE INDUSTRIAL FARMS THIS WILL TAKE TIME BUT IT CAN BE DONE ONCE THE POPULATION IS REDUCED TO A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL

WE MUST NOT GIVE HOPE
IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER TRUMP SUPPORTS ANYTHING TSH
THE VIDEO AT OR SO HIT ME STRAIGHT IN THE FEELS
HE WAS YEARS OLD CRYING ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON

THANKS THANKS GOP FOR MAKING KIDS CRY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO DENY THEM A FUTURE AND MAKE ANXIOUS CRYING IN THEIR BEDS
GO VEGAN SO WE CAN EAT VEGGIES FOREVER
YOU MEAN MORE DAMAGE THAN THE EPA HAS CAUSED
I'M CONFUSED WHO CORRALLED THE BUFFALOS
THAT'S EASY FUCK ALL LIFE THE PIPELINE MUST BE BUILT APL
ANIMALS DON'T HAVE MANY RIGHTS IN AMERICA

CLARIFICATION I'M NOT SAYING IT'S RIGHT WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO ANIMALS JUST OFFERING AN EXPLANATION
WOW THAT'S DISGUSTING
BECAUSE PROFIT IS SACROSANCT
AREN'T BUFFALO FEDERALLY PROTECTED
PROBABLY THE SAME WAY THAT WILD BUFFALO ARE LEGALLY SLAUGHTERED FROM TIME TO TIME SO THEY DON'T GIVE DOMESTIC CATTLE BRUCELLOSIS
WOW THEY REALLY ARE DESPERATE TO BUILD THAT PIPELINE
SO IS THE PIPELINE PRETTY MUCH STILL LET'S DO IT OVER SIOUX LAND ALL BUCKHEAD STYLE
SOMEONE TIP THE FBI

THEY CLEARLY HAVE WATER ITS CLICKBAIT BE SMARTER OP
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK I REALLY WANT THIS TO BE FAKE IF ANYONE FINDS ADDITIONAL INFO I'D BE REALLY INTERESTED IF THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO SUBDUE PROTESTERS BY THREATENING TO END THOSE ANIMALS LIVES IT'S NEXT LEVEL INHUMANITY
THE THREAD ABOUT AN HOUR POSTED IT WAS A RANCHERS BUFFALO AND THERE'S NO WILD BUFFALO WITHIN MILES CAN SOMEONE CONFIRM THIS
I WANT TO PUNCH WHOEVER DESIGNED THE MOBILE VERSION OF THAT SITE IN THE DICK
NORMALLY I DON'T CARE ABOUT MOST OF THE HIPPIE NONSENSE ON THIS SUB BUT THIS PISSES ME OFF
ALMOST NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER JUST A GRAINY AERIAL SHOT OF LIVESTOCK ON SNOWY GROUND SO THEY DO HAVE ACCESS TO WATER AND A BRIEF ARTICLE

THERE ARE ACTUAL DOCUMENTABLE INJUSTICES GOING ON THIS SHIT DETRACTS FROM THE ACTUAL WRONGDOING BY MAKING IT SEEM LIKE A BULLSHIT STORY
DELETED
WONDER HOW THE DENIERS WOULD LIKE IT IF WE ROUNDED THEM ALL UP AND KEPT THEM WITHOUT FOOD AND WATER

OH WAIT THAT EXACTLY WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN IF THEY KEEP IGNORING CLIMATE CHANGE
THIS IS MORE FALSE PROPAGANDA PERPETRATED BY THE NODAL RADICAL ACTIVISTS AND PROTESTERS
DISGUSTING CREATURES
THIS IS NOT NEW NEWS IT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT EARTHQUAKES IN OKLAHOMA STARTED RIGHT AFTER BRACKING STARTED

THIS WAS OVER A YEAR AGO

WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT THE PEOPLE IN OKLAHOMA THINK ABOUT THIS DO THEY STILL SUPPORT BRACKING IS ANYONE TRYING TO STOP BRACKING OR DO THEY JUST ACCEPT IT AS PART OF DOING BUSINESS

THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY BASICALLY OWNS THE STATE

IS THIS THE WAY THE POPULATION THINKS
HERE'S WHERE THE FIGURE COMES FROM
WHEN THE EPA DOES SHIT LIKE THIS IT NEEDS TO BE SERIOUSLY REVISED
BASICALLY IT'S A TRUMP TAX I HOPE IT WILL BE DONE WORLDWIDE IF TRUMP REALLY GOES AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESSES
THE KNOCK ON SARKOZY IS THAT BETWEEN HE AND CAMERON THEY PROMOTED CLINTON INTO THE FAILED LIBYA REGIME CHANGE
YET
EVERY MONTH IS THE FUCKING HOTTEST
WHY DO I THINK THEY ARE COOKING THE BOOKS ON THIS WE ARE USING MORE RESOURCES THAN EVER AND IT GOES UP EVERY YEAR
THE WORLD MUST STAND UNITED IF AMERICA ABANDONS THE WAR ON CLIMATE THEN THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY MUST IMPOSE SANCTIONS AND EMBARGOS TO CRIPPLE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY

WE CANNOT ALLOW A ROGUE NATION TO DETERMINE THE FATE OF THE PLANET

ZERO CARBON AND WORLD GOVERMENT AT ALL COST
MARC EDWARDS RECENTLY SPOKE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ABOUT THE D COUNTY AND FLINT WATER CRISES IN BOTH CASES THE PUBLIC HAS HAD TO FIGHT THE EPA AN AGENCY CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT REGARDING THE PRESENCE OF LEAD IN THE MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY


THIS IS AN APOLITICAL POST IF YOU HAVE TIME WATCH THE LECTURE IN ITS ENTIRETY TO TRULY UNDERSTAND HOW INDIVIDUALS WORKING AT THE EPA FALSIFIED REPORTS ABOUT THE LEVELS OF LEAD IN BOTH CITIES AND HOW VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT COVERED THE ISSUE UP


SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY SHOULD NOT BE COMPROMISED FOR JOB SECURITY OR POLITICAL MEASURE
BUT HOW COULD HE HE DOESN'T PLAN ON PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT
I'D LIKE TO ADD CONSIDERING A VEGAN HOLIDAY OR AT LEAST ONE NOT SO ANIMAL FOCUSED
SO YOU ARE COMPARING A PROBLEM THAT HUMANS HAVE CREATED IN THE LAST YEARS TO A PROBLEM THAT IS ABOUT BILLION YEARS IN THE FUTURE

THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES WE CAN SURVIVE OUTSIDE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM PERHAPS IT IS WORTH A SHOT

OTHER THAN THAT HUMANS ARE BOUND TO BECOME EXTINCT JUST AS A PERSON DIES SO WILL THE HUMAN RACE PRESUMABLY DO WE WANT TO DO IT QUICKLY LIKE A PERSON THAT HAS HAD LIFE GET THE BETTER OF THEM BEFORE THEY GROW OLD OR DO WE WANT TO STRETCH IT OUT SOME YEARS PERHAPS FINDING THE KEY TO AVOIDING AGING OR AVOIDING DEATH OR FOR THE HUMAN RACE FINDING OTHER PLACES TO LIVE

THE QUESTION GOES DEEPER WHAT VALUE IS HUMAN LIFE WHY ARE WE SO SPECIAL ISN'T THE REST OF LIFE SPECIAL PRESUMABLY ALL THAT WILL BE WIPED OUT IN THE END AS WELL THEN LIFE WILL BE BUT A SMALL BLIP IN THE HISTORY OF THE EVER CHANGING COSMOS OR WILL IT

HOW ABOUT SOME SMART PEOPLE LIKE TRUMP CAN START EXPLORING OTHER LANDS WHILE THE REST OF US GO VEGAN AND MAKE THE PLANET LAST AS LONG AS WE CAN
WE NEED THIS GODSPEED
DO YOU THINK THAT TRUMP WOULD FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE COMMITMENT OF THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT EVEN THOUGH IT IS AND NOT ENFORCEABLE DO YOU THINK THAT OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD EXPECT TRUMP TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT I THINK EXPECTATIONS OF HIM WILL DICTATE WHETHER SIGNING IT AT ALL MATTERS OR NOT

APPARENTLY CHINA DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT HE WILL IMPOSE TARIFFS ON CHINESE EXPORTS TO THE USA BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY
YES PLEASE
IT'S PROBABLY BEST TO START WITH WIKIPEDIA BUT THERE'S A LOT OF UNNECESSARY STUFF IN THE TEXT THAT YOU WON'T BE INTERESTED IN I PRESUME

ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD START AT CLIMATE CHANGE PAGES

ON A SITE NOTE THERE ARE NO EXPERIMENTS PROVING THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING BECAUSE THERE'S JUST ONE CLIMATE HERE ON EARTH WHAT WE DO HAVE IS AN INTERFERENCE TO THE BEST EXPLANATION AND THE METHOD
WHILE OF SCIENTISTS AGREE THAT HUMAN ACTIVITY PROBABLY HAS AFFECTED CLIMATE CHANGE GREATLY THERE'S NO PROVING ANYTHING IN SCIENCE HOWEVER THE OVERALL TREND IN THE DATA BETWEEN HUMAN ACTIVITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE SHOWS A HIGH CORRELATION

I SECOND NASA

THE USGS IS ALSO A PHENOMENAL SOURCE CHECK OUT THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND THE WMO

THE THING ABOUT YOUR QUESTION IS THAT CLIMATOLOGY INVOLVES MANY DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES AND SYSTEMS ARE INTIMATELY INTERLINKED I COULDN'T POINT YOU TO ANY PARTICULAR STUDY BUT SOME BASIC CONCEPTS TO LOOK UP THAT I THINK WOULD HELP YOU ARE THE ALBEDO EFFECT PARTICULARLY THE ICE MELTING POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND RADIATION AND GLOBAL EQUILIBRIUM ALSO LOOK UP HOW OUR OCEAN CURRENTS AFFECT TEMPERATURE

SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IS THAT ITS EFFECTS ARE NOT UNIFORM IN MAGNITUDE ITS EFFECTS INCREASE WITH LATITUDE CLIMATE SCIENTISTS MAKE PREDICTIONS BASED ON COMPUTER MODELS BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CLIMATE RECORD IS INCOMPLETE AND WE CAN ONLY MAKE APPROXIMATIONS BASED OFF OF PROXY DATA WHICH GETS LESS ACCURATE THE OLDER IT IS CLIMATE OSCILLATIONS ARE ALSO NORMAL AND THERE ARE DRIVERS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SUCH AS REDUCED SUNSPOT ACTIVITY AND THE MILANKOVITCH CYCLES ALTHOUGH THESE TAKE A VERY LONG TIME AS WELL

I'M SORRY IF THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR BUT THOSE SOURCES SHOULD BE VERY HELPFUL
SARAH PALIN IS THIS A JOKE
IT BLOWS MY MIND HOW PEOPLE DON'T THINK OF HOW BIG OF A DEAL THIS IS SOME OF MY FRIENDS THAT VOTED FOR TRUMP DIDN'T BELIEVE TRUMP WOULD GO AFTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUFF OR SIMPLY DON'T CARE DO PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN A LESS BEAUTIFUL WORLD
COULD

YEAH NUMBER IT WILLIAM THE PARTY'S ACTUAL OFFICIAL PLATFORM INCLUDES MASSIVE DEREGULATION TRUMP IS ALREADY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WITHDRAW FROM THE HISTORIC PARIS ACCORD HIS PICKS FOR CABINET INCLUDE AND FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIALISTS CLEAN ENERGY INCENTIVES WILL BE CUT NATIONAL PARKS COULD BE OPENED TO INDUSTRY

I GET THAT BIG MEDIA OUTLETS HAVE TO NORMALIZE EVENTS SOUND REASONABLE AND NOT INCITE PANIC BUT WE NEED TO PANIC AND WE NEED TO GET READY FOR AN UNPRECEDENTED FIGHT FOR THE WELLBEING OF THE PLANET IT KIND OF SUCKS BECAUSE I HAVE OTHER THINGS I'D LIKE TO DO WITH MY LIFE AND I THOUGHT WE HAD FINALLY GOTTEN ON A PRETTY GOOD COURSE I THOUGHT I COULD HAVE FAITH THAT POLICY WOULD SLOWLY PROGRESS AS EDUCATION AND CONCERN GREW AMONG PEOPLE

BUT WHAT WE ARE LEARNING IN THIS MOMENT IS HOW FRAGILE PROGRESS IS AND HOW THE SYSTEM HAS A FLAW THAT ENABLES IT TO IGNORE THE PEOPLE THE TEST WILL BE OUR RESOLVE TO DUST OURSELVES OFF AND KEEP PUSHING OR GIVE UP IN DESPAIR I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE SOME KIND OF HYPERBOLIC STUMP SPEECH OR SOMETHING BUT THE STAKES ARE IMMENSE PLUS FOR MANY OF US OUR ENERGY IS GOING TO BE DIVIDED AMONG MANY DIFFERENT FRONTS BECAUSE THE UPCOMING ADMINISTRATION IS NOT JUST BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THERE WILL BE STRUGGLES TO RETAIN CIVIL LIBERTIES FREE SPEECH GLOBAL AND HUMANITARIAN STANDING THERE WILL BE PROTESTS AGAINST THE DEREGULATION OF BANKS YES WE COULD BE LOOKING AT A REBOOT OF THE RECESSION AND AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENTS AND AGAINST THE DEPORTATION OF PEOPLE

THE WORST PART IS IT WILL BARELY MATTER THERE WILL BE VIRTUALLY NO CHECKS AND BALANCES SANDERS AND WARREN CAN'T FILLIBUSTER EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY IF THE GOP PURSUES ABOLISHING THAT RULE THIS ISN'T PARTISANSHIP ANY MORE IT'S THE DEFENSE OF BASIC IDEALS AND SUSTAINABILITY SO PLEASE PANIC A LITTLE
WELL THE PLANET IS DONE IT'S BEEN NICE KNOWING YOU GUYS IF YOU WERE EVER THINKING OF QUITTING YOUR DAY JOB TO PURSUE YOUR REAL INTERESTS NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME
MANY OF YOU WOULD STOP ON THE SIDE OF A HIGHWAY TO SAVE A DOG BUT FUCK THE WORLD RIGHT NOTHING WE CAN DO TOTAL LOSS MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP RIGHT NOW HUH
THESE PAST FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING EVERYDAY IM LOSING HOPE

WHATS THE POINT ANYMORE WERE ALL SCREWED THESE NEXT YEARS WHERE CRUCIAL IN SAVING THE PLANET WE ARE ALREADY PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN EVERYTHING WE DO NOW IS ADDING FUEL TO A UNCONTROLLABLE FIRE

WE NEED TO STAND UP AND MAKE OUR STAND BEFORE ITS TOO LATE
THIS IS MY BIGGEST FEAR ALL THE DUMB PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM BECAUSE HE HAS BALLS TO SAY MEXICANS ARE RAPISTS AND THAT HE COULD SHOOT SOMEONE AND STILL GET ELECTED ARE PROBABLY OVERJOYED THAT THERE WILL BE ALL KINDS OF NEW JOBS RAPING OUR NATIONAL PARKS THESE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE
I AM A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER AND TOLD MYSELF MANY YEARS AGO I WILL NOT WORK FOR A COMPANY THAT IMPOSES RESOURCE EXTRACTION METHODS THIS INCLUDES OIL GAS AND MINERALS BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FORESTRY INDUSTRY THEY REPLANT MORE THAN THEY TAKE WHERE I LIVE I HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY MANY HEADHUNTERS LOOKING TO UTILIZE MY SKILLS BUT HAD TO TURN DOWN A FEW VERY LUCRATIVE CONTRACTS DUE TO MY IDEOLOGY

IT'S A PERSONAL CHOICE AND NOT ONE I WOULD IMPOSE ON ANYONE I KNOW I AM NOT HAVING ANY GREAT IMPACT AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT I JUST CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO SUPPORT THE PROFITS OF A COMPANY THAT IS RUINING THE WORLD FOR MY CHILDREN IT PERSONALLY MAKES ME FEEL BETTER EVEN KNOWING MY INDIVIDUAL CHOICE ISN'T DOING MUCH TO REDUCE MY CARBON FOOTPRINT
THIS IS MORE OF A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU BLAME SOMEONE FOR WORKING ON AN OIL RIG OR IN A COAL MINE

I WOULD PERSONALLY NEVER BLAME ANYONE FOR TAKING A JOB LIKE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY OSTENSIBLY BY WORKING HARD AND EARNING A PAYCHECK

THE PEOPLE I WOULD BLAME WOULD BE THOSE IN THE GOVERNMENT STATE AND FEDERAL THAT USE TAXPAYER MONEY TO SUBSIDIZE THOSE INDUSTRIES IF WE PUT MORE MONEY INTO GREEN TECHNOLOGIES INSTEAD OF FOSSIL FUELS THEN THEY SHOULD END UP CREATING TONS OF NEW JOBS AS WELL EVENTUALLY

UNFORTUNATELY THE PEOPLE WORKING IN COAL MINES AND ON OIL RIGS ARE NOT TRAINED IN HOW TO INSTALL SOLAR PANELS OR DO GREEN CHEMISTRY IN A LABORATORY AND HENCE END UP GETTING SCREWED

WE ARE LIVING IN A CRAZY TIME NOW

WHAT INFLUENCES YOUR DECISION TO STICK TO OR DEVIATE FROM YOUR GREEN LIFESTYLE PRINCIPLES WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE YOU BEEN IN THAT ARE THE EXCEPTION TO YOUR RULES THE GUIDELINES YOU STRIVE TO FOLLOW

THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION FOR MANY PEOPLE IS CONVENIENCE HOW CONVENIENT IS IS FOR ME TO STOP DOING THIS THING OR TO START DOING ANOTHER THING IN ORDER TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT IF IT IS HARD MOST PEOPLE WILL JUSTIFY NOT DOING THAT THING IN A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS EATING WAY LESS MEAT WALKING TO WORK MORE INSTALLING TECHNOLOGY TO LIMIT ENERGY CONSUMPTION IF IT HAS MINOR IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES THEY ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO DO IT RECYCLING

JUST MY TAKE ANYWAY

I AM A BOTANY I DELETE MY NEGATIVE COMMENTS CONTACT CODE FAQ
DONE
ARE YOU CRAZY NO ONE CAN WORK FOR THAT MAN FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME IT WOULD BE CAREER SUICIDE
DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THAT ANYONE HIRED VIA THAT WOULD HAVE ANY REAL EFFECT ON THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE

THESE ARE LOW-LEVEL POSITIONS NOT DECISION MAKING POSITIONS AND CERTAINLY NOT CABINET LEVEL APPOINTMENTS

I APPROVE OF THE IDEA OF GETTING INVOLVED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS OF DOING SO BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT PLEASE DO MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF REALISTIC EXPECTATION AS WELL

I HATE IT THAT WE CANT DO MUCH AGAINST DEFORESTATION THE GOVERMENT CUT IT DOWN BY AND ITS STILL GOING TO DESTROY THE RAINFOREST
THE GOVERNMENTS AIDED POOR PEOPLE TO SETTLE IN THE RAINFOREST AS A WAY TO TRY TO IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMIC SITUATION THEY SEE IT DISINGENUOUS THAT COUNTRIES WHO ALREADY BENEFITED GREATLY FROM HURTING THE ENVIRONMENT TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN'T DO THE SAME
ITS TIME TO MILITARIZES THE UNITED NATIONS WE NEED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AT ALL COST

WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME THE WAR TO SAVE THE PLANET NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW
BRAZILIAN USUFRUCT LAWS GIVE TITLE TO PEOPLE WHO WORK UNCLAIMED LAND SO POOR PEOPLE GO OUT INTO THE FOREST CLEAR A PATCH AND DROP CATTLE ON IT TO SAY LOOK WE ARE WORKING THE LAND AFTER SOMETHING LIKE FIVE YEARS THE LAND BECOMES LEGALLY THEIRS THEN THEY SELL IT TO RICH FARMERS WHO GROW SOY ON IT THE SOY KILLS THE SOIL RINSE REPEAT
