PEOPLE COMPLAIN WHEN POSTS ARE MADE ABOUT TEA OR THE MYSTERIOUS YELLOW ORB IN THE SKY AND THEY ALSO COMPLAIN WHEN A SLIGHTLY MORE SERIOUS POST IS MADE

I DON'T MIND SEEING POSTS ABOUT POLITICS ON HERE IT IS NOT QUITE THE SAME AS THE OTHER SUBS AS THE CONVERSATION HERE IS USUALLY MUCH MORE CASUAL THE TONGUE IN CHEEK COMMENTS WE MAKE HERE WOULD BE FROWNED UPON IN MORE SERIOUS SUBS

UNLESS ALL YOU WANT TO READ ARE ENDLESS POSTS COMPLAINING ABOUT CHRIS EVANS TOP GEAR AND VARIATIONS OF TEA BEING MADE BADLY I THINK THE RULES NEED TO BE CHANGED OR RELAXED

TUT
SO THIS IS A CAMPAIGN FOR POLITICIST
CAN YOU EXTEND THAT TO TOP GEAR POSTS PLEASE
BRITISH PROBLEM THERE IS NO PLACE I CAN WHINE ABOUT POLITICS TODAY
I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLITICS AND THE EU REFERENDUM THOUGH THE REFERENDUM IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN JUST POLITICS AND PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO DISCUSS IT WITH PEOPLE WITHOUT GETTING INSULTED TO HELL AND BACK OR HAVING AN OPINION FORCED DOWN THEIR THROATS WHICH IS ONLY REALLY POSSIBLE ON THIS SUB

THERE WAS A THREAD THE OTHER DAY WHICH GOT DELETED DESPITE BEING RIGHT AT THE TOP WITH A UNVOTE RATIO AND ACTUALLY HAD SOME PROPER DISCUSSION ON IT WITHOUT PEOPLE INSULTING EACH OTHER FOR THEIR POSITION OR EVEN REALLY DECLARING WHAT THEIR POSITION WAS I AGREE THAT A THREAD IS GOING AGAINST THE RULES IF IT'S TRYING TO CONVERT PEOPLE TO A CERTAIN DIRECTION BUT IF IT'S JUST GENERAL CHAT ABOUT IT THEN I THINK IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY IS A PRETTY BIG BRITISH PROBLEM

MAYBE JUST RELAX THE RULES SLIGHTLY UNTIL THE WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HEAR OTHER PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS BECAUSE THAT THREAD THE OTHER DAY WAS CERTAINLY THE MOST CIVILISED ONE I'VE SEEN ON THIS SITE AND PROBABLY THE INTERNET IN GENERAL

IF PEOPLE WANT TO AVOID IT ENTIRELY THEY DON'T HAVE TO ENTER THE THREAD AND IT IS UNLIKELY TO PERMEATE INTO OTHERS AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT THE ARROWS ARE FOR IF PEOPLE AREN'T INTERESTED THEN IT WON'T MAKE IT TO THE TOP POSSIBLY A SINGULAR DAILY THREAD NOT SAYING I'M DESPERATE FOR IT AND IF PEOPLE THINK I'M TALKING HITE THEN THAT'S FINE JUST PUTTING SOME IDEAS OUT THERE
NO COMRADE THIS SUB PERFECT FOR POLITICS
DFW THIS IS STILL AT THE TOP OF THE SUB YET EVERY POST FROM THE LAST FEW HOURS HAS BEEN ABOUT POLITICS
CAME HERE FROM R ALL THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE DUMBEST RULE I'VE EVER SEEN
TUT
BUT THE PROBLEM OF BORIS BEING IN CHARGE OF MI6 AND CHQ TRANSCENDS POLITICS
I SUPPORT POLITICS AND IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE THE DAMN PROBLEM WITH THIS SUBREDDIT S
DON'T MENTION THE POLITICS
HEAR HEAR
I DON'T DO POLITICS
MPH DON'T MIND EITHER WAY I'M SICK OF THE REFERENDUM WHATEVER I WRITE SOME DICKHEAD TAKES OFFENSE AND TELLS ME INDIGNANTLY
SELINA SCOTT ON THE DEBATE SHOW JUST EFFECTIVELY SAID THAT IF YOU VOTE AND YOUR SIDE DOESN'T WIN THEN IT'S NOT PROPER DEMOCRACY

I'M NOT MAKING A POLITICAL POINT JUST ONE ABOUT THE INTENSE OVERWHELMING DIZZYING NAUSEATING STUPID OF SELINA SCOTT
I'M REALLY ENJOYING ALL THE POLITICS SHIT POSTING PLEASE KEEP THAT ITS ENTERTAINING
YOU MISSED A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO JUST MAKE THIS A NORMAL POST

POLITICS IS BANNED IN THIS SUB AND I STILL HAVE TO PICK THROUGH ALL THIS HITE YOU PLEBS KEEP POSTING


YOU SAY NO POLITICS YET THE FIRST TWO POSTS ANY VISITOR SEES ARE ABOUT POLITICS STRANGE
NINE OF THE POSTS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THIS SUB ARE REGARDING POLITICS EITHER ENFORCE THIS RULE OR DROP IT
I DO UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THIS RULE BUT AS A BRIT ABROAD MOST OF MY BRITISH PROBLEMS RELATE TO POLITICS THESE DAYS PERHAPS A SPINOFF SUBREDDIT BREXITPROBLEMS IS IN ORDER
POLITICS
TO THE NO POLITICS RULE
YOU HAVE TO SAY THOUGH THE COUNTRY HAS NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT AS MUCH THIS I AGREE THOUGH RULES IS RULES
WHAT HAPPENED TO FREE SPEECH WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE VERY THING THAT IS MEANT TO ALLOW FREE SPEECH
POLITICS
ISN'T DEFIANCE A BRITISH SUCCESS THOUGH OTHERWISE WE'D ALL BE SPEAKING GERMAN BY NOW
ITV HAS SOME OF THE WORST TELEVISION EVER
GMB IS TRIPE HOSTED BY PIERS MORGAN SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
LORRAINE IS LIKE A DIET VERSION OF THAT RUN BY A HOST WHO'S NEVER ON
K IS LOWEST COMMON TELEVISION AND A DISCOUNT JERRY SPRINGIER
LOOSE WOMEN IS A BUNCH OF OLD HANDBAGS LAUGHING AT MEN WATCH THE CLIPS WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT FAKING ORGASMS I SHIT YOU NOT IT'S DISGRACEFUL

WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU EXPECT FROM ITV ITS LITERALLY GRENADA ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE DAY WHICH IS BASICALLY THE SAME SHITTY TALK SHOW THEY JUST CHANGE THE HOSTS EVERY COUPLE OF HOURS THEN WHEN THAT FINISHES ITS JUST SOAPS AND REALITY TV THERE EVEN TRYING TO CAN NEWS TO FIT ANOTHER SHITTY TALK SHOW IN
I FUCKING HATE BRITISH SOCIETY
POOR PEOPLE DON'T BUY THE SHIT THAT ITV IS PAID TO ADVERTISE
THE ANSWER IS JUST TO NOT WATCH ITV IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE MISSING ANYTHING UNLESS YOU REALLY LIKE LOW BUDGET REALITY TV
SOUNDS LIKE A BLACK MIRROR EPISODE
ITV IS THE TV EQUIVALENT OF THE SUN DAILY MAIL

NO REDEEMING QUALITIES WHATSOEVER PLUS ANYTHING THAT GIVES AIR TIME TO EITHER SIMON COWELL OR PIERS MORGAN SHOULD BE NUKED FROM ORBIT JUST TO BE SURE
I'VE LIVED IN JAPAN FOR THE LAST YEARS HAS GATV BEEN REBRANCHED WHAT IS THIS BULLSHIT
TV IN GENERAL IS SHIT I DO AGREE ITV IS A MAIN OFFENDER IN THE SHUTNESS OF TV
THE SAME PROGRAMME THAT JUST PAID ERIC BRISTOW TO MAKE A LAME APOLOGY FOR BEING A TOTAL DICKWAD AND TRY AND SAVE HIS CAREER
YEAH WE DON'T HAVE LIVE TV IN OUR HOUSE RUELY BELIEVE MY KIDS WILL GROW UP TO BE BETTER ADJUSTED MORE STABLE RATIONAL PEOPLE WITHOUT IT

BONUS THEY DON'T SEE ADVERTS EVER

MPH GOOD MORNING BRITAIN HAS NEVER PRETENDED TO BE A SERIOUS TALKSHOW NEWS ETC SHOW
I THINK THAT ALL TV HAS DECLINED IN RECENT YEARS BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES TV WILL CONTINUE TO GO DOWNHILL OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS UNTIL ALL WE'RE LEFT WITH IS AMAZON NETFLIX ETC
QB
GOOD MORNING ALL YOU CUNTS OUT THERE
CUNTS
WHY DO PEOPLE STILL WATCH TV
THE FIRST QUESTION THAT SPRING TO MIND IS WHY ARE YOU WATCHING GMB
IT'S A LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAMME NOT BLOODY PANORAMA WTF WERE YOU EXPECTING

ALSO MAUREEN LIPMAN IS PRETTY COOL
HUH THEY MUST BE TAKING NOTES FROM CNN
TIL PEOPLE WATCH ITV THE ONLY GOOD THINGS THEY EVER DID WERE HARRY HILL AND BAD LADS ARMY
SO A NORMAL DAY IN BRITAINLAND THEN
FOR A MINUTE WALK I WOULD HAVE JUST WALKED
IF A BUS JOURNEY COULD BE WALKED IN MINUTES I TEND TO JUST WALK THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS IF IT IS RAINING AND THE BUS ISN'T PACKED FULL OF WET MISERABLE PEOPLE
ARE YOU IN BRISTOL

PRETEND TO WALK TO THE NEXT STOP OR LIGHT A FAG NEVER FAILS
I FEEL REALLY SPOILT NOW KNOWING THAT I CAN ACCURATELY KNOW WHEN A BUS IS GOING TO ARRIVE WHERE IT IS AT THE MOMENT AND WHAT REGISTRATION PLATE IT HAS IS THIS ONLY A LONDON THING
WORTH WAITING JUST TO KEEP OUT THE RAIN AND CHARGE YOUR PHONE
STORY OF MY LIFE MY BUS TO WORK FROM THE TUBE IS SUPPOSED TO COME EVERY MINUTES BUT CITYMAPPER FREQUENTLY SAYS THE NEXT ONE IS ABOUT MINUTES AWAY SO I START TO WALK THE MINUTE WALK TO WORK MINUTES LATER THE BUS DRIVES PAST RAGE
SHOULD REPLICATE THIS RESEARCH AND FIND OUT HOW LONG YOU SHOULD WAIT

IT'S PROBABLY LESS THAN MINERALOGY
HOLD MUSIC CLICK

AT LAST YOU THINK PICKING UP THE PHONE

WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING AN UNUSUALLY HIGH VOLUME OF CALLS

REPEAT FOREVER
YOUR BRITISHPROBLEM IS IMPORTANT TO US

WE WILL READ YOUR SUBMISSION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

COMMENTERS ARE ALL BUSY LOOKING AT OTHER POSTS

I AM A BOTANY BEEP BOOP
YOU KNOW IT'S BAD WHEN YOU'RE THINKING JUST LET ME LISTEN TO THE HOLD MUSIC
IT'S THE WAY THE RECORDED MESSAGES ALWAYS SAY I AM SORRY THAT NO YOU'RE NOT ANYTHING YOU'RE A BLOODY RECORDED VOICE NAME OF COMPANY APOLOGISES FOR WOULD BE FAR LESS
YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US JUST NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT WE EMPLOY AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF CALL HANDLERS
LAST WEEK I CANCELLED SKY TV WAS EXPECTING THE WORST

LOGGED INTO MY ACCOUNT TO FIND CONTACT DETAILS TO CANCEL OPTIONS PRESENTED EITHER TELEPHONE NUMBER EMAIL ADDRESS POSTAL ADDRESS LIVE CHAT

SELECTED LIVE CHAT OME NO HASSLE WHATSOEVER ALSO MADE IT EASIER TO BE POLITE AND PLEASANT TO THE SKY PERSON NOT ONCE DID I HAVE TO SHOUT NO I WANT TO CANCEL
THEY WANT YOU TO HANG UP THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY PEOPLE TO TALK TO YOU THEY WANT YOU TO JUST GIVE UP AND NOT CANCEL YOUR WHATEVER OR NOT BOTHER COMPLAINING OR TO JUST ACCEPT THAT YOUR WIFI IS SLOW OR GO ONLINE TO DO YOUR BANKING THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT THE WAIT IS LONG IRRITATING AND INFURIATING SO YOU'LL HANG UP AND YOU WON'T CALL AGAIN
VIRGIN MOBILE THEIR RECORDED APOLOGY FOR BEING IN A QUEUE INTERRUPTS OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS THEY'RE MAKING WHILST YOU'RE ON HOLD

ON HOLD FOR MINUTES ONLY TO BE TOLD ALTERING MY TARIFF APPARENTLY REQUIRES A SPECIALIST IN THE CONTRACT DEPARTMENT TO PRESS A BUTTON AND THAT DEPARTMENT IS CLOSED COULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT WHEN I SELECTED THE OPTION ON THE MENUS TO CHANGE MY CONTRACT FFS
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE ON HOLD AND KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE FOR A WHILE AT LEAST YOU CAN JUST LISTEN TO THE SONG TO KEEP YOUR MIND OCCUPIED BUT NO THEY INTERRUPT IT LESS THAN EVERY SECONDS TO APOLOGISE FOR THE WAIT

I KNOW I'M WAITING I DON'T NEED REMINDING THAT OFTEN JUST LET ME LISTEN TO THE MUZAK
I USED TO THINK THIS EVERY TIME I HAD TO CALL STUDENT FINANCE

I WOULDN'T MIND THE ENDLESS HOLD MUSIC IF THEY DIDN'T KEEP INTERRUPTING IT EVERY SECONDS
WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS HOW MUCH I HATE AUTOMATED PHONE SYSTEMS
I WAS ONCE ON HOLD FOR MINUTES WITH THE PEOPLE WHO HOLD YOUR DEPOSITS ON RENTAL PROPERTIES JUST TO FINALLY HEAR THE ROBOT SAY I'M SORRY WE ARE NOW CLOSED
THE FACT THAT THE YOUR CALL IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US MESSAGE IS AUTOMATED SUGGESTS OTHERWISE
PUTTING YOU THROUGH COW
WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU'D ZONE OUT AND RELAX WHILE BEING INCONVENIENCED
PAY ATTENTION TO US MAKING YOU WAIT
IT'S LIKE THOSE FUCKING TOP VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE WITH THE SAME ROBOTIC LADY VOICE BECAUSE THOSE ARE MADE IN INDIA
I'VE LEARNT TO WRITE COMPANIES LETTERS INSTEAD IF IT'S NOT URGENT TWO MINUTES TO TAP OUT AND I'VE ALWAYS GOT ENVELOPES AND STAMPS IN MY DESK LOB IT IN THE POST AND JOB DONE

IT SEEMS THAT PHYSICAL PAPER ENDS UP IN A VERY DIFFERENT SYSTEM TO EMAILS IT GETS PLACED DIRECTLY IN THE HANDS OF THE RELEVANT PERSON WHO WANTS TO AVOID BACK AND FORTH COMMUNICATION IF POSSIBLE BECAUSE NOW THEY ARE THE ONE TRYING TO GET HOLD OF YOU IT JUST GETS SORTED STRAIGHT AWAY

2 MINUTES OF MY TIME FOLLOWED BY A RESPONSE DAYS LATER IS OFTEN BETTER THAN MINUTES ON HOLD
ONCE HAD THEM SAY SORRY THEN CHANGE THE HOLD MUSIC TO A SHITTIER SONG
THERE WILL BE ROAD WORKS FOR THE NEXT MONTHS WE APOLOGISE FOR THE DELAY
I GET THIS WITH TRAINS

WE ARE SORRY TO ANNOUNCE

WELL YOU AIN'T SORRY GREAT NORTHERN ARE YOU OTHERWISE YOU'D FIX THE FACT YOU ARE DELAYED EVERY DAY
WAS THIS PC WORLD OR CURRYS I JUST HAD THIS AND NEARLY SMASHED MY PHONE IN ANGER
TOP TIP PRESSING MAKES A HUMAN ANSWER
SOMETIMES I ONLY HAVE TO PRESS IT AROUND A HUNDRED TIMES
I INSTALL VIP TELEPHONE SYSTEMS A LOT OF THE TIME THE COMPANY HAS PHONES THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED NOT BEING USED

YOU ARE EITHER IN A BIG QUEUE OR BEING IGNORED ONE HAPPENS MORE OFTEN THAN THE OTHER
NOT JUST A BRITISH PROBLEM IT DRIVES ME UP A WALL TOO
LAST TIME I CALLED AT T THE ROBOT ASKED ME QUESTIONS AND THEN THERE WERE KEYBOARD NOISES AS IF HE WAS TYPING IN MY INFORMATION
IF MY CALL IS IMPORTANT WHY NOT FUCKING ANSWER IT INSTEAD OF FEEDING ME BULLSHIT ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT MY CALL IS

IF YOU ARE PERPETUALLY EXPERIENCING AN UNUSUALLY HIGH VOLUME OF CALLS THEN YOU HAVE PERPETUALLY INSUFFICIENT STAFF AVAILABLE TO DEAL WITH THE NUMBER OF CALLS
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL THAT WE ACCEPT SUCH PEOPLE IN MODERN SOCIETY
IS THAT A EUPHEMISM FOR SOMETHING JUST SAY IT
THIS WAS ME YESTERDAY AMA
I'LL BET HIS WAS CLOSER TO TOO
I WANTED TO ASK FOR MY MEATBALLS TO BE CUT IN HALF YESTERDAY TO STOP THEM ROLLING OUT BUT I CHICKENED OUT LAST MINUTE
WHAT IS THIS MADNESS IT'S LITERALLY THE ONLY SANDWICH THAT I ORDER AND IT HAS TO BE TOASTED WITH CHEESE OTHERWISE I WILL PASS IN MY SLEEP
AS AN I CAN IMAGINE THE REACTION OF A GOOD PORTION OF DRIVERS

ARE YOU FUCKING MENTAL

CLOSE DOOR

DRIVE AWAY SHAKING YOUR HEAD IN DISBELIEF
PLEASE TELL ME THIS ISN'T A THING
PLEASE TELL US WHAT HAPPENED DID YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR A DIFFERENT BUS
IT'S BEEN AN HOUR WE'VE LOST THEM

IT WAS NICE HEARING FROM YOU OP
DON'T YOU HAVE CONTROL OF YOUR OWN HEATING
ICE ON THE INSIDE OF WINDOWS FOR US NO TAPS FROZEN THOUGH YET
PRO TIP IF YOU TOAST CRUMPETS AFTER THEY'RE DONE BALANCE THEM ON THE TOP OF THE TOASTER THE HEAT COMING FROM THE TOASTER WILL KEEP THEM WARM IN ORDER FOR THE BUTTER TO MELT
CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER SPREADS LIKE CONCRETE
ACCEPTANCE
IT DOESN'T EXCEPT THEM WHICH MEANS IT ACCEPTS THEM EXCELLENT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD MACHINE TO ME MOST OF THE ONES AROUND ME DON'T ACCEPT 2 COINS
EXCEPT


GET THE FUCK OUT
THANK YOU I WAS WONDERING I SHALL MAKE A POINT TO AVOID IT
AND THE PRICE BREAK POINTS AREN'T AT ETC DELICIOUSLY EVIL WHEN THAT HAPPENS
WHAT'S THE POINT OF ANY PAYMENT MACHINE THAT DOESN'T TAKE CARD
THE MEDIA KEEP WARNING US ABOUT PRICE RISES DUE TO BREVIT I WON'T BELIEVE IT UNTIL THIS HAPPENS
HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE GIANT BAGS FOR I COULD EASILY POLISH OFF ONE ESPECIALLY THE BEEF FLAVOUR
YOU PHILISTINE I'LL GIVE YOU MY SALT N LINKERS FOR YOUR CHEESE N ONION
DO YOU LIKE PRAWN COCKTAIL I'LL TRADE
SEND THEM TO ME
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS THE PRAWN COCKTAIL AND WORCESTER SAUCE ONES THAT GET SLOWLY ACCUMULATED
CHEESE AND ONION ARE GREAT IT'S READY SALTED THAT GET LEFT IN MY HOUSE WHAT A WASTE OF POTATO IF YOU'RE GOING TO FLAVOUR SOMETHING DON'T HALF ARSE IT
READY SALTED IS ALWAYS THE LAST FLAVOUR TO GO IT USUALLY STAYS THERE FOR A LONG TIME CHEESE AND ONION IT THE FIRST TO GO IN THIS HOUSEHOLD
TOP TIP PUT A FEW DROPS OF VINEGAR INTO THE BAG CLOSE THE TOP OF THE BAG AND SHAKE IT ABOUT SO THE VINEGAR GOES ALL OVER THE CRISPS IT TAKES THE SWEETNESS OUT OF THE CRISPS AND MAKES THEM TASTE BETTER BUT THEY CAN GET SOGGY IF YOU USE TOO MUCH VINEGAR
I'LL TRADE THOUGH KNOWING A SALT AND VINEGAR FAN PLEASE DON'T WEAR YOUR NIPPLE CLAMPS WHEN WE MEET UP PEOPLE WILL TALK
HOW DO THEY END UP BROKEN AUSSIE HERE I DON'T GET IT
MY HOMETOWN LEAVES THE LIGHTS UP ALL YEAR ROUND I DO WONDER HOW MUCH IT ACTUALLY SAVES THE COUNCIL SINCE THEY ARE EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS MUCH LONGER
A TRUE BRITISH CHRISTMAS SOMEBODY HAS TO GO AROUND CHECKING ALL THE BULBS
HAVE A LOW FAT NO ADDED SUGAR RICH TEA
YOU CHAIM TO BE EATING WELL YET EAT NO BISCUITS
TRY BREATHING THROUGH YOUR NOSE THE AIR IS WARMED BY PASSING THROUGH YOUR NASAL PASSAGES

I TRY TELLING MYSELF TO DO IT AS I GASP THROUGH MY MOUTH WHEN OUT ON MY BIKE I ONLY HAVE SMALL NOSTRILS I AM SURE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
WAS GOING TO RECOMMEND A BALACLAVA BUT COULD BE TAD RISKY THESE DAYS
IF YOU DRINK MORE TEA IT HELPS WARM THE THROAT
CHRISTMAS IS ONLY DAYS AWAY
WHO DOESN'T MAN WITH STICK HIT BALL AND RUN
YOU POSH ENGLISH TWAT
I DON'T LIKE CRICKET

I LOVE IT
TO BE CALLED A POSH ENGLISH TWAT YOU NEED A VAGUE UNDERSTANDING OF POLO TO UNDERSTAND CRICKET YOU ARE JUST A TWAT
EVERYONE IN YORKSHIRE IS POSH
WHAT'S NOT TO UNDERSTAND OBLIGATORY FUNNY RULES OF CRICKET COPY AND PASTE JOB INCOMING

YOU HAVE TWO SIDES ONE OUT IN THE FIELD AND ONE IN EACH MAN THAT'S IN THE SIDE THAT'S IN GOES OUT AND WHEN HE'S OUT HE COMES IN AND THE NEXT MAN GOES IN UNTIL HE'S OUT WHEN THEY ARE ALL OUT THE SIDE THAT'S OUT COMES IN AND THE SIDE THAT'S BEEN IN GOES OUT AND TRIES TO GET THOSE COMING IN OUT SOMETIMES YOU GET MEN STILL IN AND NOT OUT

WHEN A MAN GOES OUT TO GO IN THE MEN WHO ARE OUT TRY TO GET HIM OUT AND WHEN HE IS OUT HE GOES IN AND THE NEXT MAN IN GOES OUT AND GOES IN THERE ARE TWO MEN CALLED UMPIRES WHO STAY ALL OUT ALL THE TIME AND THEY DECIDE WHEN THE MEN WHO ARE IN ARE OUT WHEN BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN IN AND ALL THE MEN HAVE BEEN OUT AND BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN OUT TWICE AFTER ALL THE MEN HAVE BEEN IN INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE NOT OUT THAT IS THE END OF THE GAME

INVERSE SNOBBERY IS RIFE IN BRITISH CULTURE THESE DAYS MORE SO THAN REGULAR SNOBBERY BY A LONG WAY
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CRICKET TO MAKE A FILM ABOUT IT THOUGH
THE ONLY THING I LEARNED ABOUT CRICKET IS THAT IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE TEA TROLLEY AT ALL TIMES AND A WOBBLY WHEEL CAN THROW THE WHOLE GAME OFFICIAL
THE THING PEOPLE DON'T GET ABOUT CRICKET IS YOUR SUPPOSED TO WATCH IT LIVE AND GET GRADUALLY MORE DRUNK AS THE MATCH GOES ON WHICH MAKES IT MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING
DEKE TRUB INFIT
I WAS ALSO ONCE CALLED A POSH TWAT FOR PRONOUNCING MY NAME CORRECTLY

MY NAME IS MARTIN AND I USED TO LIVE JUST NEAR NORTHAMPTON THE LOCALS HAD A HABIT OF SAYING MY NAME AND SOMEHOW LEAVING THE T OUT LIKE

WHEN I COMMENTED ON THIS AND THEIR TENDENCY TO PRONOUNCE THREE AS FREE I WAS CALLED A POSH TWAT
NO YOU CAN SILLY MID-OFF
UNDERSTANDING CRICKET MAKES YOU A POSH ENGLISH TWAT BUT CRICKET IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND POLO ON THE OTHER HAND AND EVEN THEN IT IS PRETTY EASY ONCE YOU'VE PLAYED WATCHED A CHUKKA OR TWO
DOES THAT RULING WORK WORLDWIDE ONLY I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMEONE GO CALL AN AUSTRALIAN POSH ON THE BASIS OF CRICKET KNOWLEDGE TWAT I AM ASSUMING THEY'D TAKE AS A TERM OF ENDEARMENT BUT CAN'T SEE THE POSH BIT GOING DOWN SO WELL
THE BIGGEST CRICKET FANS I'VE MET HAVE MOSTLY BEEN WORKING-CLASS ASIAN GUYS
HOLD ON HOLD ON

LET THE LAD REDEEM HIMSELF WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF DARTS AND SNOOKER
FRED TRUMAN SO POSH FREDDY FLINTOFF EVEN COSHERER
JIMMY JIMINY OR POSH ENGLISH TWAT SPORT
NOTING YOUR LOCATION I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT SCOTLAND IS IN TCB TERMS A MINOR COUNTY
IT ISN'T DIFFICULT

THE RULES OF CRICKET AS EXPLAINED TO A FOREIGN VISITOR

YOU HAVE TWO SIDES ONE OUT IN THE FIELD AND ONE IN

EACH MAN THAT'S IN THE SIDE THAT'S IN GOES OUT AND WHEN HE'S OUT HE COMES IN AND THE NEXT MAN GOES IN UNTIL HE'S OUT

WHEN THEY ARE ALL OUT THE SIDE THAT'S OUT COMES IN AND THE SIDE THAT'S BEEN IN GOES OUT AND TRIES TO GET THOSE COMING IN OUT

SOMETIMES YOU GET MEN STILL IN AND NOT OUT

WHEN BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT INCLUDING THE THAT'S THE END OF THE GAME

HOWZAT

TENTATIVELY ATTRIBUTED TO THE MARYLEBONE CRICKET CLUB
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHY WOULD THE BARBER EXPECT A TIP THIS ISN'T AMERICA WE DON'T TIP UNLESS WE RECEIVED A TRULY GOOD SERVICE AND IN MY EXPERIENCE BARBERS DON'T OFFER US SUCH
I ALWAYS TIP MY BARBER SHE'S PLAYING THE SYSTEM WELL BY CHARGING KNOWING THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY TELL HER TO POCKET THE CHANGE FROM A TENNER
MY PREFERRED METHOD CONSISTS OF GOING OVER TO ASK WHAT THE TIME IS
TURNING ON THE TV IN THE MORNING TO SEE PIERS MORGAN BEEN ENOUGH
I TURNED ON THE TV SAW PIERS MORGAN TURNED OVER SAW KING OF QUEENS AND THAT WAS THE POINT WHERE I DECIDED I'D RATHER GET READY IN A COMFORTABLE SILENCE
THAT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH I HAD JUST WOKEN UP AND FELT LIKE ERIC BARSTOW WAS THE ABUSER HIMSELF THEN THAT CHARITY WOMAN WAS THE MOST SMUG WOMAN I'VE EVER SEEN NOT SAYING WHAT HE SAID WAS RIGHT BUT SHE SAID BARSTOW HARMED PEOPLE WTF
THE ONES AT MY LOCAL ONE HAVE GONE TO POT TOO SOFTWARE IS SO SLOW I ACTUALLY HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH A EMPLOYEE THERE THE OTHER DAY HE DIRECTED ME FROM THE QUEUE TO A SELF SERVE THAT I HAD ALREADY TRIED AND WOULDN'T SCAN ANYTHING HE INSISTED IT WAS WORKING I TOLD HIM IT WASN'T HE SHOUTS YES IT IS MADAM AND GRABS MY ITEMS AND TRIES TO SCAN THEM ATTEMPTS LATER STILL WASN'T SCANNING VICTORY WAS MINE
DO YOU STILL HAVE TO PRESS FINISH AND PAY TIMES FOR IT TO REGISTER AND DO THEY FINALLY ACCEPT NFC CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS
I MOSTLY WISH THE THINGS DIDN'T CONSTANTLY MAKE NOISE AT YOU DO YOU HAVE A NECTAR CARD PLEASE SCAN ITEMS PLEASE CHOOSE YOUR ITEM HAVE YOU BAGGED YOUR ITEM PLEASE SELECT PAYMENT VIA CASH OR CARD PLEASE INSERT CARD PLEASE TAKE ITEMS FUCKING HELL JUST SHUT UPPPPP
NOW WHEN I GO SHOPPING I WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP MYSELF SINGING

WHOA BLACK BETTY GRAM OF RAM

SO THANKS FOR THAT
I WORK AT A LOCAL SAINS WE ALL ARE GETTING NEW SOFTWARE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR IN ORDER TO GET CONTACT LESS SUPPORT THE SHOP I WORK AT UPGRADED THE SOFTWARE ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO AND ONLY JUST GOT CONTACT LESS VERY RECENTLY BUT THE SOFTWARE ITSELF IS TRULY AWFUL THE TILLS FREEZING UP IS A REGULAR THING THE MENUS SOMETIMES DON'T MAKE SENSE AND IT MAKES THE MOST BASIC THINGS LIKE SIGNING IN MORE OF A HASSLE THAN IT NEEDS TO BE

I ASKED ONE OF MY SUPERVISORS WHY IT WAS SO DREADFUL AND APPARENTLY SAINTSBURY CHAPED OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ON THE NEW SOFTWARE BY BUYING THE LICENSE TO ALREADY EXISTING STUFF AND CHANGING IT SLIGHTLY THEY ALSO STATED IN THE TRAINING VIDEOS FOR THE NEW SOFTWARE THAT IT'S TAKEN THEM YEARS TO PERFECT THIS NEW SOFTWARE YEAH RIGHT
THE ONE IN MY LOCAL FINALLY HAS CONTACTLESS I WENT IN A BIT BOOZY AND WAS SO OVERJOYED
WE ACTUALLY HAD THE RAM IN OUR MACHINES UPGRADED IN PREPARATION FOR THE NEW SOFTWARE THEY'RE STILL SLOW AS HELL AND CONSTANTLY FREEZING BREAKING DOWN AND ARE GENERALLY MORE OF A NUISANCE FOR US THAN THEY WERE BEFORE BUT HEY CONTACTLESS AMBRITE
THE LOCAL BY MY UNI ISN'T TOO BAD THE MACHINES HAVE THAT CONTACTLESS THING SO PAYMENTS ARE A DOOZY BUT THERE'S BARELY ANY SPACE TO PACK THINGS UP AND I SWEAR YOU'D HAVE TO DROP AN ITEM THREE TIMES BEFORE IT DETECTS ITS IN THE BAGGING AREA THE GOODBYE AT THE END FEELS A LIL NARKY KINDA MISS THE OL THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING AT X THAT WAS BASICALLY EVERYWHERE BUT HEY CONTACTLESS IS WHERE ITS AT
ITEM IN BAGGING AREA
ONE GRAM YOU CAN WEIGH RAM NOW
UNEXPECTED ITEM IN BAGGING AREA AGE VERIFICATION REQUIRED NO ITEMS IN THE BAGGING AREA NO BAGS HAD ONLY A FEW VEGGIES FOR DINNER I'M I THINK I'M ALLOWED TO EAT VEGGIES WITHOUT SUPERVISION
I USED ONE YESTERDAY MY MIND WAS OOOO CONFUSED
MY LOCAL INSTALLED THEM LAST WEEK AS WELL THEY'RE SLOW AND SOMEHOW THEY MADE THE VOICE EVEN MORE IRRITATING PLUS THE DESIGN LOOKS A BIT SHIT
I WORK FOR THEM THE ACTUAL TILLS HAVE HAD THE SAME UPDATES AND THEY'RE ALL RUNNING ON THE OLDEST SHITTIEST COMPUTERS YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOUR STORE ISN'T IN A CITY CENTRE THEN THEY WILL BE SLOW AND SHITTY

THEY LIKE TO GO SO SLOW AND JUST CRASH AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY THE BEST PART IS THE POS SYSTEM UPDATE WAS DELAYED BY AN ENTIRE YEAR AND IN THAT YEAR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS CHANGED


I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG AS CONTACTLESS RULES EVERYTHING AROUND ME AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL SO SLOW AND UNINTUITIVE THIS IS REALLY ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE ME TO SHOP ELSEWHERE
I LIKE TO RACE THEM TO SEE IF I CAN PAY ON CARD BEFORE IT SAYS PLEASE INSERT YOUR CARD I WIN TIMES OUT OF
FOR ANYONE ELSE WHO WAS WONDERING ONE GRAM OF RAM IS APPARENTLY ABOUT A TWENTIETH OF A GB MODULE
LOCAL SAINTSBURY HAS FINALLY SWITCHED TO CONTACTLESS ONLY ABOUT YEARS LATE TO THE GAME
IT HAS ONE GRAM OF RAM

WELSH MUST BE OUTRAGED
HERE'S MY SOLUTION ASSIGN A MEMBER OF STAFF TO EACH CHECKOUT AND LET THEM SCAN YOUR STUFF AND PRESS THE BUTTONS FOR YOU

MIGHT CUT INTO PROFITS A BIT MORE BUT IT WOULD MEAN SOME OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY SO LOVE TO OFFER
IS THERE ANY REASON WHY THEY DON'T HAVE CONTACTLESS YET AND WHEN I PUT MY CARD IN IT RECONGISES THAT THERE IS A CARD IN BUT STILL HAVE TO PRESS THE CARD OPTION
MY LOCAL SAINTSBURY SELF SERVE TILL STOP TAKING AFTER A CERTAIN TIME SO YOU'RE LEFT STANDING FEEDING IT ALL THE POUND COINS IN YOUR PURSE UNTIL YOU RUN OUT WHILE IT SCREAMS AT YOU ABOUT WISHING TO CONTINUE
I PAID A TENNER THE OTHER DAY AND IT DIDN'T REGISTER IT STAFF HAD TO CHECK CCTV TO PROVE I WAS TELLING THE TRUTH SUCH A WASTE OF TIME
THEY ARE BUT IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR CONTACTLESS
TRIED TO REMOVE AN ITEM THE OTHER DAY AND IT TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR
MANAGEMENT WILL PROBABLY READ THIS THINKING WOW OUR COST SAVING MEASURES WORKED AND PEOPLE AREN'T COMPLETELY UP IN ARMS ABOUT IT GREAT WORK GUYS
I GOT INTO A RAP BATTLE WITH ONE AT IT KEPT ASKING ME SHIT AND I WAS HUNG OVER AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ALL I WANTED WAS A SANDWICH
TO BE FAIR ONLY BEING TRULY DREADFUL DOES SOUND LIKE A SLIGHT UPGRADE
SELF SERVICE BLOODY USELESS

I AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE END UP NEEDING THE SELF SERVE OPERATOR ABOUT TIMES FOR BAGGING AREA BOOZE TAGS

I ONCE TOOK MY OWN TAG OFF BECAUSE THEY WERE STOOD CHATTING NOT PAYING ATTENTION AND THEY WENT APESHIT
I WAS ASKED BY ONE HAVE YOU SWIPED YOUR NECTAR CARD

MY RESPONSE OF YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T SO WHY ARE YOU ASKING YOU PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE BITCH RESULTED IN SOME SURPRISED LOOKS FROM MY FELLOW SHOPPERS
UNUSUALLY FOR GUERNSEY IT SEEMS WE'RE AHEAD OF THE TIMES I RECENTLY HAD THE JOYOUS EXPERIENCE OF USING THE NEW SELF CHECKOUT MACHINES IN WAITROSE NOT ONLY ARE THEY EQUIPPED WITH CONTACTLESS THEY ALSO MAKE THE REMARKABLE ASSUMPTION THAT NOT EVERYONE THAT WALKS THROUGH THE DOOR IS A THIEF AND AS SUCH ALLOW YOU TO SCAN MULTIPLE ITEMS WITHOUT PLACING THEM IN THE BAGGING AREA

REGRETTABLY KNOWING THAT SELF CHECKOUT MACHINES AS GOOD AS THE ONES IN WAITROSE ACTUALLY EXIST HAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED MY PATIENCE WITH OTHER LESSER MACHINES
PLEASE WRITE THEM A LETTER I DID THIS WHEN THEY UPGRADED OUR LOCAL AND IT WAS ATROCIOUS THE MORE COMPLAINTS THEY GET MAYBE THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
THE NEW CO-OP ONES ARE AWFUL TOO MY LOCAL HAS TWO SELF-SERVICE AND TWO THOUGH USUALLY ONE STAFFED CHECKOUTS EVERYONE NOW QUEUES FOR THE STAFFED ONES BECAUSE IT'S FASTER TO QUEUE AND HAVE THE STAFF DO IT THAN USE THE SELF-SERVICE ONES
YEAH MAN THEY JUST CHANGED THEM NEAR ME AND THEY ARE HITE SO SLOW LIKE SO MUCH WORSE THAN WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE SAINS YOU ARE KILLING ME
THE SOFTWARE IS AWFUL BUT THE MAIN HEADLINE HERE IS THAT THEY FINALLY HAVE CONTACTLESS
YAY NEW CONTACTLESS TERMINALS BOO DIABOLICAL NEW SOFTWARE
STILL NO CONTACTLESS TOO
OUR LOCAL COOP HAS RECENTLY HAD THEM FITTED AND THEY RARELY WORK PROPERLY 2 WEREN'T GIVING THE RIGHT CHANGE EARLIER WHICH WAS GREAT
I'M JUST HAPPY THEY ADDED CONTACTLESS NOW IT'S WAY EASIER FOR ME TO WALK IN EARLY IN THE MORNING AND GET SOME MILK FOR MY TEA AND BE ABLE TO PAY WITH MY PHONE
MANCHESTER PICCADILLY HAS THE OLD SELF SERVICE UI BUT ACCEPTS CONTACTLESS BUT THE ONE YARDS AWAY ON THE STATION APPROACH HAS THE NEW CRAPPY ONE AND IT REALLY BUGS ME
MINE HAS CONTACT PAYMENTS NOW
IM USED TO SOULLESSLY CHECKING OUT WITHOUT HAVING TO THINK ABOUT WHERE I PUT MY FINGER BUT I CURRENTLY LACK THE MUSCLE MEMORY TO DO SO ON THE NEW MACHINES I HAVE TO LOOK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IM DOING ITS AWFUL
I LOVE HOW COMPANIES THING YEAR OLD HAND-ME-DOWN COMPUTER SYSTEMS USING WINDOWS XP CAN SUFFICE A TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM I REALLY APOLOGISE I WORK FOR M S THOUGH BUT ON THE I KNOW HOW SLOW THEY ARE DUE TO HOW OLD THE SOFTWARE IS THEY'RE BEYOND IN NEED OF AN ACTUAL HARDWARE SOFTWARE IN MOST PLACES
YOU CAN PAINT A TURD ANY COLOR YOU LIKE IT'S STILL RUNNING ON AN INTURN WITH HALF A TURD OF RANDOM ACCESS TURD
KILLERMONT STREET GLASGOW

I COUNTED TAPS BEFORE IT FINALLY LET ME PAY WITH CARD SAINTSBURY ARE THE ONLY SUPERMARKET TO MAKE THEIR MACHINES WORSE WITH AN UPDATE
IT IS POSITIVELY DISASTROUS I GO TO THE VESTRY ROAD CAMBERWELL ONE AND ITS SLOW AS HELL BUT WHEN I'M IN LEATHERHEAD ITS THE OLD QUICK STYLE
IF IT IS ANY CONSOLATION COLES IN AUSTRALIA HAVE ALSO NOW I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT BUTTONS I PRESS
AFTER REPEATED TROUBLE WITH SUPERMARKET I MADE THE DECISION NOT TO USE THEM UNTIL THEY WERE FAR MORE RELIABLE

OF COURSE AS I DON'T ACTUALLY USE THEM I WILL NEVER KNOW IF BY SOME MIRACLE OF CORPORATE SOFTWARE DESIGN THEY EVER DO BECOME FAR MORE RELIABLE THIS DILEMMA DOES NOT BOTHER ME IN THE SLIGHTEST
THIS ISN'T A PROBLEM THIS MAKES ME FEEL POSH LIKE I'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE FLASH TAPS THAT CONTROLS THE TEMPERATURE

I FEEL LIKE A KING WHEN I POUR MY MORNING ORANGE SQUASH NO WASTING WATER FOR ME
TIL THE WORD GARRULOUS THANKS OP
WORKED AT ASDA FOR YEARS WILL DO PRETTY MUCH ALL I CAN NOW TO AVOID HUMAN INTERACTION
I LOVE A GOOD NATTER AT A CHECKOUT I WISH MORE OF OUR CASHIERS WERE FRIENDLY AND TALKATIVE
WHEN I WAS LITTLE PAT DIDN'T HAVE A HELICOPTER BLOODY PRIVITISATION
SEEMS TO BE SOME REQUIREMENT OF KIDS TV THAT THE LOCALS ARE AMAZINGLY THICK AND IRRESPONSIBLE FIREMAN SAM LIVES IN A TOWN FULL OF ARSONISTS

CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT A KIDS TV SHOW ABOUT A LOCAL DOCTOR WOULD BE LIKE
I WISH THEY'D STOP REMAKING CLASSIC CHILDREN'S TELEVISION PROGRAMMES BOB THE BUILDER FIREMAN SAM THUNDERBIRDS AND EVEN POSTMAN PAT I UNDERSTAND THEY WANT TO APPEAL TO THE AUDIENCE OF TODAY BUT KIDS OF THAT AGE DON'T CARE THEY JUST LOVE THE CHARACTERS ALSO IT JUST ANNOYS THE PARENTS WHEN THEY HAVE TO WATCH SLIGHTLY RUINED VERSIONS OF THEIR CHILDHOOD
AMAZON NOW PAT
ADVENTURE BAY WOULD BE VASTLY SAFER AND QUIETER IF THEY JUST REPLACED THEIR MAYOR
YES I DID THIS TODAY TEA EVERYWHERE I'M SO GLAD I'M NOT ALONE IN THIS
TELL THEM IT HURTS TO JUMP THE QUEUE
YOU SHOULD SHOP AT IT'S A PERFECT MATCH
CASHIER USE THE CONTACTLESS IF YOU WANT TOO

ME DON'T HAVE IT YET SORRY

CASHIER

MINUTES OF AWKWARD SILENCE AND ANNOYED COUGHS FROM THE REST OF THE QUEUE AS I KEY IN MY PIN NUMBER TO DIP INTO MY OVERDRAFT FOR THE TIME THIS MONTH

I HAVE IT BUT THE MONTHS IT TAKES TO COME OUT YOUR ACCOUNT IS PERPETUATING
ANDROID PAY IS ALWAYS AN OPTION
I JUST PAY CASH

I GOT CONTACTLESS CARDS AND EVERYTHING PREFER PAYING CASH EASIER TO BUDGET THAT WAY YOU GET YOUR MONEY OUT FOR THE WEEK AND THAT'S GOT TO LAST YOU TIL THE NEXT WEEK

GOOD WAY TO SAVE AND STOP IMPULSE PURCHASING
OLD PEOPLE WHO ARE HELL BENT ON NOT USING CONTACTLESS YET COMPLAIN WHEN THEIR CHIP AND PIN TRANSACTION IS TAKING TOO LONG
APPLE PAY LIFE SAVER
YEAH BUT CHIP AND PIN IS IMMENSELY MORE SAFE THAN CONTACTLESS
JUST GOT MY NEW CARD ON FRIDAY I'M SURE AT SOME POINT THE NOVELTY WILL WEAR OFF BUT FOR THE TIME BEING IT'S GREAT
CARD HAS IT BUT IT DOESN'T WORK USE ANDROID PAY INSTEAD
WHAT A FIRST WORLD CITIZEN PROBLEM

TRY USING A POORLY CONFIGURED GERMAN OR US CHIP AND SIGNATURE CARD IN THE UK IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME REAL FUN SEEING THE CARD READER DISPLAY REMOVE CARD AND HAND TO OPERATOR OH THE AWKWARDNESS
EVEN MORE SO WHEN THE STORE CLERK METICULOUSLY COMPARES THE SIGNATURE ON YOUR CARD TO WHAT YOU HAVE SCRAWLED ON THE RECEIPT AND ASKS FOR ID TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY OR SWEARS AT YOU FOR HAVING SWIPED THE CARD EVEN THOUGH YOU DULY DIPPED IT

WORST OF IT ALL IS THAT THOSE CARDS WILL USUALLY BE ACCEPTED AT RAIL TICKET MACHINES WITHOUT ANY IDENTIFICATION AT ALL SO ANYONE CAN READILY BUY A FANCY AND PRICEY RAIL TICKET WITH A LOST STOLEN CARD UNLESS IT'S BEEN CANCELLED
SO YOU USE CONTACTLESS EVERY OTHER TIME YOU NEVER SPEND MORE THAN AT A TIME IN A SHOP EVER
THIS HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME AT THE PUB ALL MY MATES HAVE CONTACTLESS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ME MUGGINS HERE HAS TO SAY IT'S NOT CONTACTLESS FOLLOWED BY AN ARDY LOOK FROM THE BAR STAFF
I'M WAITING FOR IT TO HAVE BETTER PROTECTION THAN WE PROMISE YOU CAN ONLY SPEND A DAY LIKE PROMPT ME FOR A PIN EVERY TIME OR SOMETHING

NOT A SINGLE PERSON I KNOW WOULD CALL THE HOUSE PHONE IF IT RINGS IT'S EITHER SPAM OR VIRGIN TRYING TO UNSELL ME MORE SHIT
IT'S BEEN UNPLUGGED
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A LANDLINE AS PART OF MY BROADBAND PACKAGE ANYMORE

THE GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANIES STILL SEEM PERPLEXED WHEN THEY ASK ME FOR MY LANDLINE NUMBER AND I TELL THEM I DON'T HAVE ONE
PEOPLE WHO CALL MY HOUSE PHONE ARE

MY MOTHER IN LAW

PPI SHAMMERS


PEOPLE WHO RING THE HOUSE PHONE CRAZY PSYCHO AXE MURDERERS WHO WANT TO THREATEN ME BY CREEPILY WHISPERING DOWN THE PHONE AND MY NAN
SOMEONE THINKS OUR PHONE NUMBER IS HIS WE GET CALLS FROM DEBT COLLECTORS AND TAKEAWAY MOSTLY
HOUSE PHONES STILL EXIST SINCE WHEN I'VE NOT HAD A HOUSE PHONE IN YEARS
MUST BE NICE TO HAVE A FUCKING MOBILE SIGNAL INSIDE THE HOUSE BASTARDS
I HAVE ONE PURELY TO CALL TAXIS BECAUSE MY LOCAL TAXI LINE HAS ONE OF THOSE TO ORDER A TAXI NOW PRESS THINGS SO I DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK TO AN OPERATOR BUT IT DOESN'T WORK ON A MOBILE PHONE OBVIOUSLY BLISS
I'M BASICALLY AT THE POINT NOW WHERE I M READY TO INSTANTLY HANG UP WHEN THE HOUSE PHONE GOES BECAUSE OF THE TIME IT'S COLD CALLERS AUTOMATED MESSAGES

ONLY REASON I'VE STILL GOT THE PHONE IS BECAUSE STUPIDLY IT'S CHEAPER TO HAVE THE PHONE IN A PACKAGE WITH VIRGIN BROADBAND TV THAN IT IS WITHOUT IT
I DITCHED MINE A MONTH BACK NOW CARE OF MOBILE AND VIP I CAN ANSWER OR IGNORE WITHOUT HAVING TO WONDER WHO IT MIGHT BE NOT IN THE PHONE BOOK SAY HELLO TO THE ANSWERPHONE
IF IT HAPPENS AT MY HOUSE IGNORE IT IT'S SPAM OR A WRONG NUMBER IF IT HAPPENS AT MY PARENTS FAMILY HOME ANSWER THAT SHIT QUICK BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS PROBABLY DIED
GOD BLESS FIBRE OPTIC AND NO NEED FOR TELEPHONES
IT WAS PROBABLY

I AM FROM MICROSOFT IN CALIFORNIA I AM CALLING YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE A VIRUS ON YOUR COMPUTER
MUST BE NICE TO HAVE A FUCKING MOBILE SIGNAL INSIDE THE HOUSE BASTARDS
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A HOUSE PHONE I DON'T THINK UNDER OR SO BOTHERS ANY MORE DO THEY

WHEN I GO TO MY PARENTS HOUSE THEY SEEM TO BE INTERRUPTED EVERY COUPLE OF HOURS BY SOMEONE FLOGGING PPI COMPO AN INDIAN MICROSOFT SCAMMER OR A DEAD LINE
YOU CAN LOOK ON THE BOX TO SEE WHAT ITS WEIGHT IS LISTED AS AND COMPARE THE PRICE TO OTHER CHOCOLATES BY WEIGHT
I'VE GOT TWO ONES FOR CHRISTMAS AND A ONE I WILL PALM OFF ON THE BOY FOR HIS STOCKING HE CAN PRISE MY FORTY GRAMMES OUT OF MY COLD DEAD HANDS
I BOUGHT A HUNDRED GRAM ONE TODAY THE PIECES SEEMED THE NORMAL DISTANCE APART
YOU'LL PROBABLY NEED A NEW CAR BEFORE TOMORROW
TELL HIM NEXT TIME YOU'RE RUNNING REALLY LATE FOR SOMETHING AND IF HE'S BRITISH ENOUGH HE WON'T MIND AND YOU CAN BE ON YOUR WAY
WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU THINKING
GET THEM ON YOUR POLICY NOW IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
OR WORSE DRIVE PAST PRETENDING TO NOT NOTICE HIM ONLY FOR THEM TO WALK PAST NOD AS YOU ARE STUCK IN TRAFFIC ONLY TO MEET THEM AGAIN AGAIN EN ROUTE TO WORK
YOUR GONNA HAVE TO GIVE HIM A LIFT ALL THE TIME NOW OTHERWISE YOU'LL LOOK LIKE A RIGHT SHIT
WHEN YOU SEE HIM WAITING NEXT AND LOCK EYES WITH HIM AS YOU DRIVE PAST
ISN'T THERE A LAW AGAINST THAT KIND OF THING I'M SURE I CAN FIND YOU SOME TEXT THAT SAYS THERESA MAY RECENTLY BANNED SUCH PRACTICE
I'D LOVE TO SEE HOW YOU SHIT IN A DIGESTIVE
THE NATIVITY PLAY ONE OF THE WORST FORMS OF TORTURE THAT MANKIND HAS DEVELOPED THANK GOD THAT YOU ONLY HAVE TO ENDURE IT A COUPLE OF TIMES I YOUR LIFETIME I PITY TEACHERS THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT EVERY YEAR
TO TAKE YOUR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL EARLY BUT YOU SAVE ON YOUR HOLIDAY
IT'S NOT THE FEE IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THEM IT'S THE FEE IS BEING USED TO GIVE MUSLIM KIDS BOOKS IN ARABIC OR PUNJABI THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT

IT'S THE PERFECT DAILY MAIL STORM
FAR LEFT SCHOOLS NOT CONTENT WITH THE DEATH OF YOUR RELIGION AND DIANA EXTORT CHRISTMAS SPIRIT BY CHARGING ENTRANCE FEES TO SEE THEIR CHILDRENS PLAY TO FUND ISLAMIC TEXTBOOKS WILL THIS GIVE YOU CANCER
I THOUGHT NATIVITY PLAYS ALWAYS HAD A TICKET FEE
EH THE TEACHERS HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR CHRISTMAS PARTY SOMEHOW
IT'S THE PRINCIPLE OF FINING YOU FOR TREATING YOUR KID TO A BREAK IN THE MONOTONY OF LIFE NOT THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE
HOW IS IT A BREE OR SUMMAT

JUST SAY SOMETHING THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE THEM THEY WILL BE RIDICULOUSLY FLATTERED YOU CARED AND REMEMBERED
SOMEONE SAID HELLO TO ME ON THURSDAY BUT I WAS LOOKING THE OTHER WAY AND LISTENING TO WHO I WAS WITH TALKING SO I HAD NO CLUE EVEN THOUGH SHE REALISED AND SAID HELLO I STILL FEEL THE NEED TO TRACK HIM DOWN AND PERSONALLY APOLOGISE
TSH I CAN SEE WHY THEY MIGHT NOT BE HAPPY THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO LIVE THEIR LIFE TRYING TO PROTECT ANIMALS TO AN EXTENT THEY ARE NOW BASICALLY FORCED TO INTERACT WITH SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN VERY PARTIALLY CREATED THROUGH THE HARM OF ANIMALS
GREAT NOW THAT LINE OF COKE WASN'T TECHNICALLY VEGAN
IF ANY VEGETARIANS VEGANS DONT WANT THEM I'LL HAVE THEM

PERSONALLY I THINK THEY SHOULD BE MADE FROM THE RENDERED TALLOW OF FRESHLY ROASTED BANKERS
THEY'LL JUST HAVE TO ASK FOR CHANGE IN COINS THEN TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE
DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL IT IS IF IT'S PIG FAT THEN THAT COULD AFFECT MORE THAN JUST VEGETARIANS
I'M A VEGETARIAN AND I THINK THERE'S FAR TOO MUCH HYPE OVER IT IN ALL HONESTY YEAH IT'S NOT GREAT AND SURELY THEY COULD HAVE USED SOMETHING BETTER BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE MASS DISCRIMINATION ISSUE IT'S MADE OUT TO BE IMO

ASK FOR CHANGE IN POUND COINS OR USE CARD

IF IT WERE SOMETHING I WAS EATING I'D FEEL MORE STRONGLY BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL WHERE MONEY HAS BEEN ANYWAY ANY OLD FIVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN HELD BY GREASY BACON FINGERS IT'S A TRACE OF A BYPRODUCT MAKING THE MOST OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE WASTED IF THEY WERE KILLING ANIMALS PURELY FOR MAKING NOTES THEN YES I'D BE PISSED BUT A TRACE AMOUNT OF SOMETHING THAT'D BE THROWN AWAY IN THE MAKEUP OF THE PLASTIC ALTHOUGH NOT GREAT NEWS IS NOT EQUIVALENT FORCE FEEDING A HAM SANDWICH TO EVERYONE WHO AVOIDS MEAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST
THEY DO I'M A VEGGIE AND DIDN'T KNOW THIS

I WON'T BE GIVING ANY OF MY FIVERS AWAY BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TO
I'VE GOT A SUSPICION THIS MAY BE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG I BET A HUGE NUMBER OF THINGS MADE FROM POLYMER PELLETS WILL TURN OUT TO INVOLVE TALLOW SOMEWHERE IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS
I'M A VEGGIE NOT THAT BOTHERED BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT I CAN LICK AND CHEW MY FIVERS IF I CHOSE TO
I'M NOT VEGETARIAN BUT I'VE HAD TO POST THIS LIKE TIMES

IT'S NOT ABOTE EATING THEM IF YOU'RE VEGETARIAN BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT ANIMALS KILLED FOR OUR USE WHY WOULD YOU SUPPORT THE USE OF THEIR FAT
I WILL BUY YOUR TAINTED NON VEGAN FIVE POUND NOTES FOR THERE WILL BE A ADMIN CHARGE PER NOTE AND A POSTAGE CHARGE PER NOTE

EXCHANGE TEN NOTES AT ONCE AND I'LL THROW IN FREE POSTAGE
EVERYTHING HAS ANIMAL PRODUCTS IN IT FFS SHAMPOO HAS ANIMAL PRODUCTS

WAIT I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN ON FOR THE THE LAST MONTHS

ONLY MINUTES
IT LAYS DOWN THE GAUNTLET FOR LENGTH FOR CHARLIE BROOKER
AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF IT WILL BE IDIOT CELEBRITIES NOBODY HAS HEARD OF GIVING THEIR OPINIONS ON THE DEATHS OF PEOPLE VASTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEY'LL EVER BE AS IF ANYONE GIVES A FUCK WHAT THEY THINK
MINUTES MIGHT NOT EVEN COVER THE OBITS
I WAS GOING TO LIST ALL THE SHITTY PROGRAMS CHANNEL HAVE BUT REALISED WHEN I GOT TO BENEFITS THERE WASNT ENOUGH INK IN THE INTERNET TO WRITE THEM ALL DOWN

HERE WERE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS

A AND E WHEN PATIENTS ATTACK

ANGRY BRITAIN

ABO AND PROUD

BENEFITS

BENEFITS BRITAIN LIFE ON THE DOLE

BENEFITS BY THE SEA

BENEFITS AND BYPASSES

BUDGIES MAKE YOU LAUGH OUT LOUD
I'M KIND OF CONCERNED ABOUT HOW ARE THEY GOING TO FIT EVERYTHING IN MINUTES
SERIOUSLY DOES ANYONE WATCH CHANNEL
I HOPE THEY WAIT UNTIL TO BROADCAST IT BECAUSE IF THEY SHOW IT WITH 2 WEEKS OF LEFT TO GO THE WAY HAS BEEN WILL MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE ALL SORTS OF SHIT HAPPENING IN THOSE LAST TWO WEEKS
MINUTES SO BASICALLY A MONTAGE
SO IT'LL BE LIKE A MINUTE RENDITION OF BILLY WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE THAT JUST DEGENERATES INTO SOBBING AND WAILING AFTER ABOUT TWO MINUTES

SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT
HAS NOT JUST BEEN ABOUT THE BAD THINGS IT'S ALSO BEEN ABOUT THE TOTALLY UNEXPECTED LEICESTER WINNING THE PREMIERSHIP CUBS WINNING BASEBALL WORLD SERIES BREVIT TRUMP WINNING FALLS INTO BOTH CATEGORIES
CHANNEL HAVE AN ARCHIVE OF CONTENT FROM AND MINUTES TO FILL IT IS ANOTHER CHEAP TO PRODUCE PROGRAMME IN THE VEIN OF SUCH TOSH AS CHANNEL S IS OUR WEATHER GETTING WORSE
JUST WAIT TILL CHARLIE BOOKERS WIPE
I'M SORRY BUT MINUTES IS JUST ENOUGH TIME TO GET THROUGH THE DONALD TRUMP PALAKA THEY'RE GONNA NEED TO MAKE IT MUCH LONGER TO FIT IN ALL THE CRAP HAS THROWN OUR WAY
DAMN CURRENT YEAR
WHAT EXACTLY IS BAD ABOUT IT A FEW CELEBRITIES DIED IT'S BEEN NO WORSE THAN ANY OTHER YEAR NO MAJOR NATURAL DISASTERS
CUNTS

I WAS BROUGHT UP IN LINCOLNSHIRE AND LOVE THEM SAUSAGES ALTHOUGH I EAT VEGETARIAN ONES SO AS NOT TO CONSUME WHATEVER LITERAL SHIT WAS IN THE PIGS TUBES AND ALSO THEIR MINCED PIG ARSEHOLE
JUST AS A POINT OF INTEREST CAN YOU RIOT ON YOUR OWN
TO THINK PEOPLE STILL PREFER SAUSAGES OVER CHIPOLATA
SORRY MATE WRONG SUB YOU'RE LOOKING FOR R BRITISHSUCCESS
YOU CAN PROBABLY GET A REFUND ONLINE
AS HORRIFYING AS THE CONCEPT IS YOU SHOULD CALL AND COMPLAIN THEY'LL LIKELY REFUND THE SAUSAGE COST LEAVING YOU WITH FREE PORK AND APPLE SAUSAGES WHICH ARE MARGINALLY MORE PALATABLE
A BUS DRIVER ONCE CALLED ME A PRICK FOR PAYING WITH A TEN THE FARE WAS THE FUCK
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT'S ILLEGAL BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY BE COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT TO THE BUS COMPANY
THANKFULLY I HAVEN'T BEEN ON A BUS FOR ABOUT YEARS BUT IT WAS CHEAPER TO GET A DAY TICKET THAN MY TOWN CENTRE IN A SMALL TOWN THAT WAS AROUND I'D IMAGINE YOU WOULDN'T GET MUCH LEFT WITH NOW
SWEATER SWEATER JUMPER FFS
SWEATER

GET HIM BOYS
IRONING IS ONE OF THOSE SHITTY THINGS THAT SOME PEOPLE FEEL OBLIGED TO DO JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE DOES IT IF NOBODY DID NOBODY WOULD NOTICE
I KNOW THIS PAIN WELL
I'M WEARING AN SHIRT UNDER MY JUMPER AS I TYPE THIS

IT'S MY GO TOO IN THE WINTER SAVES ME LITERALLY MINUTES IN THE MORNING
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO THIS DILEMMA

GET A SUIT JACKET BLAZER FROM A SHOP LIKE TOPMAN THEY ARE QUITE CHEAP SO THE MATERIAL IS REALLY THIN AND YOU DON'T MELT UNDERNEATH YOU LOOK PRETENTIOUSLY SMART WHILE HIDING THE FACT YOU ARE INCOMPETENTLY LAZY

2 BLACK SHIRTS YOU REALLY CANT TELL

SHIRTS WITH COMPLEX PATTERNS PRETEND THE CREASES ARE PART OF SAID PATTERNS

GET PROMOTED AND USE THE EXTRA MONEY TO PAY SOMEONE TO IRON YOUR SHIRTS

DON'T LISTEN TO THAT GUY WHO SAID IRON YOUR SHIRTS THAT'S BAD ADVICE
IF YOU'VE BEEN WEARING A JUMPER AND COAT OVER AN IRONED SHIRT IT'LL PROBABLY BE ALL CRUMPLED ANYWAY SO TAKE IT OFF AND IF YOU GET ANY FUNNY LOOKS SWEAR BLIND THAT YOU IRONED IT
IMPLYING I IRON MY WORK CLOTHES HA HA

I IRON MY SOCIAL CLOTHES THOUGH
WHO IRONS SHIRTS IN THIS DAY AND AGE MUST BE POSH
FIRST OFF AS EVERYONE ELSE HAS SAID IT'S A JUMPER

SECOND IRON YOUR BLOOMING SHIRTS YOU STAYABLE LAYABOUT
JUST BUT A LITTLE TINY BIT MORE OF FABRIC CONDITIONER OR LOADS INTO EVERY WASH IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC AND HANGING YOUR CLOTHES INSTEAD OF FOLDING THEM DOWN HELPS AS WELL
WEAR A PLASTIC JUMPER AND THEN THE HEAT AND SWEAT WILL STEAM OUT ANY CREASES BY AFTERNOON YOU'LL LOOK LIKE YOU'VE JUST PUT IT ON FRESH FROM THE IRONING BOARD
THIS INFORMATIVE VIDEO SHOULD HELP YOUR MUM FIND OUT WHICH PAPER WOULD SUIT HER BEST
NO WORSE THAN THE STENCH OF BULLISH T FROM THE DAILY MAIL

IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S USED TO THE MAIL WHICH IS WRITTEN IN SHIT
THE GUARDIAN SO YOUR JUST SWITCHING HER FROM ONE BIAS NEWSPAPER TO AN EVEN MORE BIAS NEWSPAPER
THERE'S A CLASS OF BRITISH WOMAN THAT'S BECOME THEY TUT EVERYTHING
WELL I MEAN SHE MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE APOLOGY OR WAS SO STARTED AT NEARLY BEING RUN INTO THAT THE TUT CAME OUT BEFORE SHE HAD TIME THINK CALLING HER A BITCH IS A BIT MUCH THOUGH JOG ON
GET HOME AND PUT A BAD SPELL ON HER SO SHE WAKES UP WITH BIG NASTY ZIT ON HER FOREHEAD
THE CORRECT PROCEDURE IS TO CALL IN SICK YOU'RE NOT ON LEAVE IF YOU'RE SICK A NOTE WOULD HELP BUT YOU'LL PROBABLY BE OK IN 2 WEEKS WHEN THE NEXT APPOINTMENT COMES UP
BETTER THAN IN A TREE IT'S LIKE DOG OWNERS ARE TRYING TO DECORATE PARK TREE BRANCHES WITH BAGS OF THEIR ANIMALS SHIT DISGUSTING
WAS THE BUS BROKEN
WAS WALKING TO WORK IN LONDON AND SAW A LADY WITH A HUGE DOG STOP WAIT FOR IT TO POOP BEND DOWN TO PICK IT UP CAREFULLY TIE THE BAG UP AND THEN DROP IT RIGHT WHERE SHE WAS STANDING AND WALK AWAY WHY THE FUCK DOES SOMEONE GO TO THE EFFORT OF PICKING UP THE SHIT AND THEN JUST DROP IT WHERE THEY STAND FUCKING CARRY IT TO A BIN AT LEAST DRIVES ME EXTRA MAD BECAUSE I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS A CONSIDERATE DOG OWNER AND WILL TRAIPSE ACROSS A FIELD TO FIND THE POOH MY DOG HAS LEFT IN ORDER TO PICK IT UP AND END UP CARRYING A BAG AROUND FOR ALMOST AN HOUR BEFORE I CAN FIND A BIN TO PUT IT IN
I WAS ON THE TRAIN YESTERDAY AND AS IT PULLED IN TO ITS NEXT STOP I WITNESSED A MAN YANK HIS DOG'S CHAIN IN A HURRY ONLY FOR THE DOG TO SPONTANEOUSLY SHIT ON THE PLATFORM AND CONTINUE TO SHIT AS IT MOVED
PART TIME WORK WITH A HAPPY ENDING WORKING FOR THE COUNCIL INVESTIGATING ALL THE MASSAGE JOB OFFERS THAT GET STUCK TO THE NOTICEBOARD IN THE CORNER SHOP
SHAME HE WASN'T A VIETNAM VETERAN HE'D HAVE HAD HIS FAIR SHARE OF HAPPY ENDINGS
MORE PROOF THAT RETIRING IS SOMEHOW WORSE THAN WORKING A JOB YOU HATE
SO DREADFULLY SORRY FOR MAKING YOU APOLOGISE
ASK HIM IF HE WANTS A BIG ONE
JUST ASK HIM IF HE FEELS LIKE A BIG BOY WHO IS READY FOR A BIG CUP
BLIMEY HOW LONG IS HE STAYING FOR
MY MOTHER ALWAYS CALLS IT VINO COLLAPSE AND TO THIS DAY STILL THINKS IT IS FUNNY
MY MUM HAS AND WILL ALWAYS CALL IT PLONK
PEOPLE AROUND HERE DO IT ALL THE TIME EXCEPT THEY DO IT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE
MICROWAVE
DOWN IT THEN MAKE ANOTHER CUP YOU CAN ACTUALLY ENJOY

ALTHOUGH IF HE BROUGHT IT TO YOU TOO COLD TO BEGIN WITH YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TELL HIM IF IT'S A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP DON'T WANT TO SPEND AGES GETTING COLD TEA
LOUDLY EXCUSE ME COULD YOU MOVE YOUR BAG OUT OF THE AISLE WE NEED TO MOVE DOWN SO OTHER PEOPLE CAN GET ON NOW THEY'RE THE MOST HATED PERSON ON THE TRAIN YOU PUT THAT BLAME EXACTLY WHERE IT BELONGS
BECAUSE SOMEONE AN ABSOLUTE TOSSPOT

YOU CAN JUST TAKE A PAIR OF SHARP SCISSORS TO YOUR SIM CARD TO TRIM IT DOWN I'VE GONE FROM A FULL TO MICRO TO NANO AND IT STILL WORKS PLUS SAVES YOU HAVING TO WAIT FOR THE NEW ONE TO ARRIVE
I DID THAT ON AS A PAG CUSTOMER I COULDN'T BE BOTHERED GOING THROUGH CUSTOMER SERVICES SO I JUST ORDERED A NEW SIM FOR FREE I GUESS THEY'RE TREATING ME AS A NEW CUSTOMER

I AM GOING TO TELL MYSELF YOU LIVE IN A LOVELY LITTLE VILLAGE WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS ONE ANOTHER AND YOU SEE THE RECEPTIONIST IN YOUR LOCAL EVERY FRIDAY

IN MY IMAGINATION YOU ARE CALLED GEORGE AND YOU DRINK IN THE ROSE AND CROWN ON PRIMROSE LANE
THE FRIENDLY RECEPTIONIST IS CALLED MARY ANN AND SHE WORKS FOR DR WALLACE WHO COMES FROM A LONG LINE OF MEDICAL MEN

PLEASE DO NOT SPOIL THIS LOVELY SCENARIO
NO ITS PERSONAL
IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE TEMPERATURES RISE TO DEGREES FAHRENHEIT

NO DAVID I CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
TIME TO RENAME THE BOAT BACK TO BOAT MCBOATFACE
HIS GENERATION ALL USED FARENHEIT IT'S FINE
IT'S ALLOWED BUZ HE'S OLD

MY MUM AND DAD STILL USE FAHRENHEIT THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE A CUPPER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU HID THE CHEW TOY WHEN I SAY OH IT'S GONNA BE BLAH BLAH CELSIUS TODAY THEY REMEMBER OLD MONEY TOO WHEN THERE WAS THRUPPENCE BITS HA'PENNY AND SHILLINGS IT'S LIKE TALKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE WITH THEM SOMETIMES
THEREFORE PROVING HIS TRUE BRITISHNESS BY NOT USING SOME JOHNNY COME LATELY FOREIGN RUBBISH
I BET HE GETS PAID IN GUINEAS AND SOVEREIGNS AS WELL
I'M STILL REELING FROM DESCRIBING A HEATH ROBINSON DEVICE AS BEING RUBE GOLDBERG
THE DAILY MAIL WAS RIGHT HE IS A SADIST AND A BASTARD
IT'LL MAKE THIS TWAT HAPPY
I'M SURE FAHRENHEIT IS AN AFTERSHAVE MY DAD USED TO WEAR
AND HERE I WAS THINKING CELSIUS WAS THE ONE METRIC MEASUREMENT WE HAD ALL FULLY EMBRACED
FUCK WHAT DO WE DO NOW
BREVIT IS REALLY HITTING HARD
IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN ANNOYING ME A LOT HE'S BEEN USING IMPERIAL MEASUREMENTS THROUGHOUT THE SHOW WHICH SEEMS REALLY OUT OF PLACE FOR A SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME JARS A LOT
I'D BE LYING IF I SAID I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED COME ON DAVID I EXPECT MORE
I THOUGHT OLD PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO STILL USE IT LIKE

THAT'S MY RULE ANYWAY ALTHOUGH BOTH MY ANS MANAGED TO MASTER CELSIUS AND POUNDS STERLING AND GRAMS AND OK DAVE SHOULD KNOW BETTER
HE'S OURS NOW BOYS SOMEBODY GET DAVID HIS COMPLIMENTARY DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER AND AMERICAN FLAG SHORTS
I SAW HIS NAME ON MY FRONT PAGE AND MY HEART SKIPPED A BEAT

HE'S ONE OF MY HEROES I THINK I CAN LET USING FARENHEIT SLIDE THIS ONE TIME
TV SHOWS ALWAYS USE FAHRENHEIT FOR WHEN ITS HOT AND CELSIUS WHEN ITS COLD IT SOUNDS MORE DRAMATIC BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE MORE EXTREME
WHY WOULD DAVID HURT US LIKE THAT
WHEN IS BRITAIN GOING TO STOP USING MILES PER HOUR
HOW THE HELL CAN YOU GUYS CRITICIZE HIM WHEN YOU USE FUCKING STONE TO MEASURE BODY WEIGHT
IT'S FUNNY I JUST PUT IT ON INLAYER AND EVEN THOUGH THE SHOT WAS FANTASTIC ALL I COULD THINKS WAS WHY WOULD HE DO THAT THEN I CAME ON REDDIN THANKS ATTENBOROUGH SHOWS EVEN THE BEST OF US CAN MAKE MISTAKES
PRETTY SURE THAT ABOLISHING THE METRIC SYSTEM IS WHY WE VOTED FOR BREVIT
UGH THAT'S WORSE THAN SAYING CENTIGRADE
I THOUGHT THIS AND WEPT SILENTLY INTO MY HOBNOB I KNOW HE DID IT FOR EFFECT BUT DAVID WHY
I THOUGHT WE USE FAHRENHEIT WHEN SOMETHINGS HOT SO WE CAN MAKE IT SEEM MORE SO
DIDN'T THE QUEEN USE THE WORD SOCCER ONCE

SPAZ SHE DIDN'T
DID YOU NOTICE HOW THE TOP GEAR GRAND TOUR GUYS ARE USING KPH IN THE SHOW NOW INSTEAD OF MPH

IT'S GLOBALIZATION SELLING OUT
SORRY WHAT'S WRONG WITH USING IMPERIAL MEASUREMENTS

THE FACT THAT WE CAN INTERCHANGEABLY RANDOMLY USE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT UNITS OF MEASUREMENTS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES US GREAT

YOU'LL BE DEMANDING THAT WE SELL BEER IN HALF LITRES NEXT
DEDUCT AND THEN HALF THE RESULT

F C
ACTUALLY I NOTICED LAST WEEK THAT HE USED MPH INSTEAD OF THE USUAL KPH NICE THAT I DIDNT HAVE TO DO A LITTLE MENTAL CONVERSION TO KNOW HOW FAST AN EAGLE CAN FLY
OH GOD
WAS HE TRAVELLING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT FLYING THROUGH THE SKY LIKE A TIGER DEFYING THE LAWS OF GRAVITY
I THOUGHT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT MARS
WHY WHY WHY
AIR TIME AND CHANNEL
BRIAN COX FOR PM
I WAS SO UPSET WHEN I NOTICED HE HAD REVERTED TO IMPERIAL UNITS IN PREVIOUS EPISODES I THOUGHT IT WAS BREVIT
THAT'S LIKE BROOKS TENSE MOORE USING METRIC MEASUREMENTS WHILE NARRATING HOW IT'S MADE FOR THE US
THANKS BREVIT
THE BASTARD
BOT BEEP BEEP I'M ALL ABOUT TOP POSTS

THIS POST HAD UPVOTES AND GOT POSTED TO TWITTER AND SUBREDDIT R REDDIN

THE TWEET



ALL UPVOTES ARE ON AND R REDDIN

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL POSTS ON AND R REDDIN
IT DOESN'T EVEN AIR ON MY CABLE IN THE U S
SUCH A SAD MOMENT IN HISTORY RIP
ANYONE OVER BORN AND RAISED IN THE UK STILL THINKS IN FAHRENHEIT
SEE ALSO POUNDS AND OUNCES ONLY OLD AITS AND DRUG DEALERS
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT FEET AND INCHES TOO I ALWAYS MENTALLY CONVERT METRES INTO YARDS SO THAT I CAN VISUALISER IT EASIER BUT I FIND CENTIMETRES OK FOR ANYTHING UNDER A FOOT
WATCHED PLANET EARTH UNTIL THE CLAIM THAT POLAR BEARS ARE DROWNING

SQUINT EYES STOP WATCHING
HAVING BEEN IN THE UK FOR A MONTH NOW I'VE SEEN METRIC USED FOR MOST THINGS IMPERIAL USED FOR SOME THINGS JUST SEEMS TO BE AT THE PREFERENCE OF WHOEVER IS USING IT

AND NO ONE HERE SMILES THAT'S WEIRD
HE'S REALLY GONE DOWNHILL AFTER THE BOAT MCBOATFACE FIASCO
TO MY GRANDPARENTS THEY MIGHT CONSIDER CELSIUS AN AWFUL EUROPEAN INTRUSION INTO IMPERIAL UNITS
IT'S THE BRITISH WAY FAHRENHEIT FOR HOT TEMPERATURES AND CELSIUS FOR COLD THAT WAY WE CAN EXAGGERATE THE WEATHER
KELVIN OR BUST
GOSH DON'T TELL THE DAILY MAIL WHATEVER YOU DO JUST DON'T TELL EM


IMAGINE THE HEADLINE



DAVID ATTENBOROUGH DECLARED AN ENEMY OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE FOR USING THE GASTLY FAHRENHEIT TRAITOR
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU USE FAHRENHEIT IF ITS HOT AND CELSIUS IF ITS REALLY COLD
YOU USED A SEMICOLON IN A HEADLINE BIT AMERICAN
PLEASE CAN SOMEONE TELL ME ARE SOME OF THOSE BIRDS COMPUTER GENERATED THEY LOOK SO FAKE
BRITISH PROBLEMS PEOPLE IN GB ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN OF THE ENGLISH FIRST LANGUAGE SPEAKING WORLD
I TOO WAS MORTIFIED HOWEVER WE THEN GOT TO SEE A GIRAFFE KICK A LION I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL RIGHT NOW THIS SERIES IS A
AH WELL I HEAR DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHERS
WELL DEPENDING ON YOUR AGE HE IS OF OUR GRANDPARENTS GENERATION HOW MANY OF OUR GRANDPARENTS USE THE NEWFANGLED CELSIUS
ONE OF US ONE OF US ONES OF US ME A FILTHY YANK
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HE IS USING FAHRENHEIT IN THE ONE TRADITIONAL BRITISH CONTEXT MAKING SOMETHING HOT SOUND EVEN FUCKING HOTTER WE ALWAYS USE CELSIUS UNTIL IT STARTS GETTING NEAR FAHRENHEIT THEN WE SPEND THE HEAT-WAVE SAYING FUCK ME IT'S NEARLY DEGREES THEN WE RETURN TO CELSIUS LIKE SENSIBLE PEOPLE IN THIS CONTEXT FAHRENHEIT SOUNDS SERIOUSLY HOT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T
WORD CLOUD OUT OF ALL THE COMMENTS HETP

I HOPE YOU LIKE IT
DON'T FORGET DAVID WAS RAISED IN BRITAIN WHERE FAHRENHEIT WAS THE TEMPERATURE SCALE OF CHOICE
I USE F FOR HIGH TEMPERATURES AND C FOR LOW WHEN REFERRING TO THE WEATHER ALWAYS HAVE

BUT THEN BY REDDIN STANDARDS BEING I'M AS OLD AS TIME
THE BRITISH WAY IS TO USE CELSIUS WHEN IT'S S COLD AND FAHRENHEIT WHEN IT'S HOT
EXCEPT YOU KNOW FAHRENHEIT IS MORE USEFUL FOR MEASURING TYPICAL WEATHER RANGES THAN CELSIUS MORE PRECISE PER DEGREE ZERO REPRESENTS THE NORMAL LOWEST TEMPERATURE AND IS ABOUT THE HIGHEST CELSIUS IS OBVIOUSLY BETTER FOR SCIENCE BUT ISN'T REALLY NECESSARY FOR THE EVERYDAY PERSON
TO BE FAIR GIVEN HIS AGE HE WOULD HAVE GROWN UP USING FAHRENHEIT TO MEASURE TEMPERATURE
HE'S SHOWING HIS SUPPORT FOR LEAVING THE EU BY REJECTING THEIR SILLY MEASUREMENTS
SUCCESS SURELY USING THE SCALE WE USED LONG BEFORE CENTIGRADE AND IS STILL USED
I'M SORRY IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH ATTENBOROUGH USING FREEDOM UNITS
DELETED
METRIC IS BETTER THAN IMPERIAL BUT I PREFER THE FINER GRANULARITY OF FAHRENHEIT DEGREES CELSIUS IS HEALTHY BODY TEMPERATURE DEGREES CELSIUS IS ALSO A FEVER VS DEGREES JUST SOUNDS BETTER
GUYS YOU JUST VOTED ABOUT THIS SIX MONTHS AGO
ONE MEASUREMENT THAT PUT MEN ON THE MOON AND THERE'S ONE THAT DIDN'T
FAHRENHEIT WOULD BE CORRECT WE SHOULDN'T BE USING THIS CONTINENTAL CELSIUS RUBBISH
FAHRENHEIT IS THE ONE IMPERIAL CUSTOMARY UNIT THAT'S BETTER THAN METRIC CELSIUS SUCKS FOR EVERYDAY USE ITS DEGREES ARE TOO BIG AND YOU HAVE TO USE NEGATIVE NUMBERS ALL THE TIME IT'S NOT EVEN ACTUALLY GOOD FOR SCIENCE SINCE YOU CAN'T COMPARE TEMPERATURES LIKE YOU CAN WITH KELVIN
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY YOU BRITS DON'T HAVE OUR BACK ON FAHRENHEIT YOU GUYS USE STONE WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST RIDICULOUS UNIT
BOW DOWN TO OUR MORE ACCURATE UNIT OF MEASURE
FAHRENHEIT IS TECHNICALLY MORE ACCURATE ALTHOUGH IT STILL MAKES NO SENSE RELATIVE TO ANY TEMPERATURE THRESHOLDS
BRITISH USE BOTH CELSIUS AND FAHRENHEIT FAHRENHEIT WHEN IT'S HOT TO MAKE THE NUMBER MORE DRAMATIC AND CELSIUS WHEN IT'S COLDER TO DRAMATIZE THOSE NUMBERS
IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT DUDE THE TEMPERATURE T IN DEGREES CELSIUS C IS EQUAL TO THE TEMPERATURE T IN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT F MINUS TIMES
OH FUCK OFF YOU STUPID CUNTS INVENTED THAT SCALE
YEAH SORRY I FORGOT THE BUS COULD SPROUT WINGS AND FLY OVER TRAFFIC DRAGGING ITS MEATY COCK ALONG THE ROOFTOPS OF THE CARS LEAVING A SLIMY TRAIL AS IT GOES
YOU DID THAT UP MY WAY YOU WOULD BE THROWN OFF THE BUS
THEY'RE SELLING DRUGS
SORT OF IN THIS VEIN I ONCE HEARD A FAIRGROUND CAROUSEL VERSION OF THE SOUND OF SILENCE AT A SEASIDE AMUSEMENTS ONCE TO SAY IT WAS CREEPY WAS A BIT OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT
I CANT REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I SEEN A TALLY VAN ROUND MY WAY
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT ICE CREAM VAN SELLERS DO IN THE WINTER SURELY THEY DON'T TURN OVER THAT MUCH IN THE SUMMER TO TAKE THE WINTER OFF SOMEONE ENLIGHTEN ME
YEAH THE ONE ROUND HERE MOSTLY COMES AT NIGHT MOSTLY
AS I READ COMMENTS I JUST REALISED THAT I WAS BUYING DRUGS AT WRONG PLACES MY WHOLE LIFE
HE ALSO SELLS DRUGS MAYBE
IS HE DRESSED AS A CLOWN I FEEL LIKE HE SHOULD BE DRESSED AS A CLOWN
HE'S JUST NERVOUS GALLOPING KNOB ROT WILL DO STRANGE THINGS TO PSYCHOLOGY
I HOPE HE'S THERE TO BE NEUTERED
I WAS ONCE AT A SEXUAL HEALTH CLINIC AND SAW THE RECEPTIONIST FLIRTING WITH A GUY WHO HAD JUST COME IN FOR STD TESTS
NEXT TIME JUST BURN THE CRABS OFF WITH A LIGHTER
YOU'D EXPECT BETTER FROM A DOCTOR
CLASSY
I THINK YOU'LL FIND ITS REDDIN LAW THAT YOU TELL US WHAT DISGUSTING OOZING DISEASE YOU'VE PICKED UP FROM YOUR TERRIBLY SLUTTY WAYS
DID IT SEEM LIKE THEY WERE THERE ON A DATE
ME TOO OP NERVOUS AF S
DON'T WORRY THERE'LL BE A SINGLE TINY LITTLE BUMP ON THE AT SOME POINT AND THE WHOLE OF TEESSIDE WILL GRIND TO A HALT FOR THE NEXT MONTHS
UP THE BORO

I'M JUST PLEASED I RECOGNISED A CARRY ON
SURELY IN THIS SITUATION YOU RETURN A WINK AND A LITTLE GRIND OF YOUR OWN
ON THE CENTRAL LINE IS THE NAME OF MY NEW PORN SERIES
IT'S AN ACCEPTABLE OXBRIDGIAN PRONUNCIATION STRANGELY ENOUGH SECOND PRONUNCIATION HERE
OP NEEDS TO GO FIND ANOTHER WINDMILL TO TILT AT
JEREMY PAXMAN IS RUBBISH AT FOREIGN PRONUNCIATION GENERALLY FRENCH MILDLY AWFUL LATIN EMBARRASSINGLY PEDESTRIAN GERMAN CATASTROPHICALLY POOR

MIND YOU EVEN THE RADIO ANNOUNCERS ARE RUBBISH AT GERMAN THESE DAYS OBVIOUSLY THEY JUST CAN'T GET THE STAFFORDSHIRE
WHAT'S WORSE IS THE MAN OF LA MANCHA HAD PETER O'TOOLE IN IT AND BECAUSE HE WASN'T A SINGER THEY DUBBED HIS SINGING WITH SOMEONE WHO SOUNDED PRETTY MUCH AS YOU WOULD HAVE GOT IF HE'D DONE IT HIMSELF
I FULLY DOUBT THAT
DO YOU HAVE YOUTUBE FOR THIS CRITICAL SWINGOMETER
ONE OF MY MORE FUN TASKS WAS DOING DELAY ANALYSIS ON A SELECTION OF BUSES IN MANCHESTER FOR A WEEK

SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY GOING BACK AND FORTH ON THE SAME ROUTE SITTING AT THE FRONT OF THE BUS WITH A STOPWATCH WRITING DOWN HOW LONG WE WERE STUCK IN TRAFFIC AND FOR WHAT REASON
THIS WAS ALSO DONE IN THE LEAD UP TO CHRISTMAS SO IT WAS FREEZING AND I HAD TO KEEP WIPING THE WINDOW TO SEE ANYTHING
FUCKING TRANSPORT IN MANCHESTER IS FUCKING FUCKED

LAST TUESDAY IT TOOK ME 2 HOURS FOR A HOUR JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE TO AND ON THE WAY OUT AT IT TOOK ME 2 HOURS MINUTES TO GET HOME AND IT COST TO FUCKING PARK
OH MY GOD IT'S HORRENDOUS

THE TRAMS ARE DELAYED ALL THE FUCKING TIME AND WHILST I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS WITH THE CYCLE LANES AND THAT IT FEELS LIKE CONSTANT ROADWORK AROUND THE UNIVERSITIES NOW

WHY DO WE NOT HAVE SOME SORT OF UNDERGROUND OR EVEN BLOODY PLANS TO BUILD ONE THAT FOR SOME WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT SPENDING I'M SICK OF SITTING IN ONE OF BUSES BACKED UP END-TO-END IN TO OR OUT OF THE CITY CENTRE
TONIGHT I WAS STUCK ON DEANSGATE LOOKING LIKE A RIGHT WALLY WAITING FOR THE TO PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME HOME GOT THERE IN TIME FOR THE BUS THAT LEFT CHARLTON ST AT TO BE PICKED UP AT BY THE BUS DRIVER WHO'D LEFT CHARLTON ST AT

NOW I'M NOT SAYING THE ROADWORKS AT ST PETERS SQUARE ARE BAD OR THAT THE TRAFFIC ON DEANSGATE BETWEEN THE HOURS OF AND IS SO FUCKING RIDICULOUS I'D BE OK WITH BANNING CARS FROM MANCHESTER CITY CENTRE ALTOGETHER BUT
I STAYED IN PRESTWICH FOR A WEEK AND THE BUSES THERE WERE RATHER AWFUL I MUST ADMIT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN MANCHESTER AND BURY ON A NEAR DAILY BASIS I DON'T KNOW IF THE BUSES WERE BETTER THAN THE METRO BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE THEY DIDN'T ACCUSE ME OF THEFT OR WHATEVER ON THE BUS
MANCHESTER BUS SERVICES HAVE TO COUNT AS ONE OF THE WORST I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE GOT TO THE BUS STOP AT TWENTY PAST THREE IN THE MORNING TO GET THE AT HALF PAST AND THEN STILL BE STOOD THERE WAITING AT QUARTER TO BEFORE CONCEDING THAT THE BUS WILL NEVER IN FACT SHOW UP AND I HAVE TO SPEND ON A TAXI
AND ALWAYS SUCH A DRY HEAT MAKES MY SKIN ITCH
TRAVELLING ON THE TUBE IS HELL I GO FROM EXTREME COLD TO EXTREME HEAT WITHIN SECONDS AND MY COAT IS FAR TOO FIDDLY TO BE TAKING ON AND OFF SO OFTEN
YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR COAT OFF WHEN YOU'RE INDOORS OR YOU WON'T FEEL THE BENEFIT WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE
WHY DO THEY DO THIS
JUST MAKES ME BUY WHAT I WENT IN FOR AND LEAVE
THEY ARE MISSING OUT ON MY WANDERING AROUND BUYING CRAP I DON'T WANT
IT ISN'T HARD ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SET THE TEMPERATURE TO TRY AND MAINTAIN TO C THE BOG STANDARD ZONE FOR COMFORT IRREGARDLESS OF IF IT IS SUMMER OR WINTER IF IT IS TOO HOT THEN THE AC WILL LOWER TO AND IF IT IS TOO COLD IT WILL HEAT TO ITS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE

I MEASURED MY CARRIAGE ON SW TRAINS LAST NIGHT AT C AND ALL THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE COULD SAY WAS PARAPHRASED TOUGH IT'S SET AT DEPOT AND THEY CAN'T CHANGE IT
THAT'S THE WAY POP MUSIC WORKS
I DID LIKE SOME OF HIS OLD SONGS BUT HIS LATEST SONGS HAVE BEEN AWFUL

PLUS THE PARTY LIKE A RUSSIAN MUSIC VIDEO WAS SO
HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF STILL BEING ALIVE
BOWIE CHANGED HIS SOUND A LOT AND PEOPLE DIDN'T ALWAYS TAKE TO IT I DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS A PROBLEM ESPECIALLY AS HE'S STILL ONE OF THE TOP SELLING ARTISTS EVER
SO THAT'S HOW THE CHARTS WORK
A GREAT ENTERTAINER BOWIE WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST ARTISTIC GENIUSES WHOSE MUSIC DID DOES AND ALWAYS SHALL MEAN A LOT TO ME AS FOR ELVIS HE BE THE KING CARE NOT FOR LISTS AND STATS JUST DIG WHAT YOU DIG
THE GENERAL MUSIC BUYING PUBLIC ARE SHEEP THEY WANT BACKGROUND MUSIC
SHORT BACK AND SIDES NUMBER 2 AND A TRIM ON TOP
CLASSIC STORY

OLD GENTLEMEN WALKS INTO BARBERS AND IS SEATED BARBER ASKS HOW WOULD SIR LIKE HIS HAIR CUT TODAY TO WHICH THE OLD GENT REPLIES IN SILENCE
YOU SE ONCE YOU GET TO MY AGE YOU CAN JUST SAY TWO ON THE SIDES FIVE ON TOP AND THEN LET THEM GET ON WITH IT
IF THEY'RE NEW I ASK FOR AN INVERSE MOHICAN I'M BALDING SO IT GOES DOWN REALLY WELL
LIKE THAT BUT LESS SO
AS A MAN STRUGGLING WITH MALE PATTERN BALDNESS ALL I CAN SAY IS CAN YOU MAKE IT LOOK SLIGHTLY THICKER
DO YOU STRUGGLE TO CHOOSE WHICH SOCKS TO WEAR TOO
BARBER

HER

WHAT YOU HAVE YOURSELF THERE IS A HAIRDRESSER
SQUARE OR TAPERED
JUST FUCK MY SHIT UP
JUST TRIM IT AND I'LL TIP IF YOU DON'T MAKE AWKWARD SMALL TALK WITH ME

YOUR MATE IS A CUNT
MIDDLE LANE HOGGERS ARE DANGEROUS THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
WHAT'S MORE DANGEROUS IS POPPING IN AND OUT OF THE INSIDE LANES FOR DICKS GOING AT I GO AT A CONSTANT SO I GO INSIDE YOU WANNA BREAK THE LAW AND GO FASTER YOU HAVE A LANE TO OVER TAKE ME
THE WORST PART IS MORE PEOPLE WILL TAKE OFFENCE TO THE WORD POOF BUT WON'T BAT AN EYELID AT HIM CALLING ABUSE VICTIMS WEAK
WHAT'S HAPPENED EXACTLY IT'S ALL OVER TWITTER BUT I CAN'T MAKE HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT
LIKE A BUNGALOW
APARTMENT PERFECTLY GOOD ENGLISH TERM FOR A CONNECTED SUITE OF ROOMS IT'S IN DICTIONARY FELL OUT OF GENERAL USAGE IN THE UK WHILE BEING LOVINGLY PRESERVED IN THE USA

FLAT NASTY CENTURY NEOLOGISM MEANING APARTMENT NOT IN JOHNSON INEXPLICABLY IDENTIFIED AS SOMEHOW BEING THE MORE CROMULENT WORD BY MANY BRITS
APARTMENT INDICATES YOU HAVE A JOB
FLAT SAYS YOU'RE RENTING FROM THE COUNCIL
PENTHOUSE MEANS YOU'RE STINKING RICH AND CAN AFFORD TO HAVE YOUR PREMIUM HIKED UP
CONDOMINIUM
THERE IS A BLOCK OF FLATS IN LINCOLN THAT INSIST ON CALLING THEMSELVES APARTMENTS FROM WHAT I CAN SEE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THEY COST A LOST MORE AND HAVE UNDERGROUND PARKING STILL GOT A SHITTING LITTLE OPEN PLAN KITCHEN DINER LIKE
2ND FLOOR OF A CASTLE NEXT TIME
THE BIGGER PROBLEM FOR ME IS WHO RENEWS BY PHONE SURELY YOU GET AN FROM THEM CLICK A LINK AND YOUR CREDIT CARD GETS CHARGED

REMINDS ME OF THE DAYS BEFORE THE INTERNET THOUGH AND BEFORE COMPARISON SITES WHEN I FIRST LEARNED TO DRIVE IN THE YOU USED TO PICK HALF A DOZEN RANDOM INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM YELLOW PAGES AND PHONE EACH OF THEM FOR A QUOTE THEN YOU'D PHONE BACK THE CHEAPEST ONE TO ACCEPT THEIR QUOTE ONE YEAR I JUST RANDOMLY STARTED FLIRTING WITH THE SALESGIRL PHONED HER BACK TO BUY THE INSURANCE SHE WASN'T THE CHEAPEST BUT SHE WAS THE AND ONLY A COUPLE OF QUID MORE FOR THE YEAR THAN THE CHEAPEST AND NEARLY MANAGED TO ARRANGE A DATE SHE AGREED AT FIRST WE SWAPPED DETAILS AND EVEN ARRANGED A PLACE AND TIME BUT SHE BACKED OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE BUT IT'S STILL A LOT CLOSER THAN I'VE EVER COME TO GETTING A DATE FROM A COMPARISON WEBSITE
APARTMENT YOU MEAN A FLAT I PRESUME
A HOUSE SUGGESTS DRIVEWAY PARKING AN APARTMENT FLAT DOES NOT
THE FORMER IS CONSIDERED LESS RISK
CAREFUL DON'T LET THE LOCALS HEAR YOU TALKING SMACK ABOUT TIMTAMS
BOIL WATER IN A PAN AND MAKE A CUP FROM THAT TAKE THE KETTLE OUT OF THE EQUATION

IF ITS STILL TASTING CRAPPY BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS RINGTOSS YORKSHIRE OR ASSAM SEABAGS
TOOTH GUM OR THROAT INFECTION AS EVEN IF VERY SUBTLE CAN RUIN YOUR TASTE BUDS
IT ALL JUST TASTES LIKE WARM SLIGHTLY GROSS WATER



I'VE TRIED TETLEY AND PG TIPS



SUGAR



FOUND YOUR PROBLEM S
WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM AT WORK I'M CONVINCED OURS IS DOWN TO THE DISHWASHER BUT OTHERS THINK IT'S THE SUGAR
WHILST YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TASTE THEM IN A NEAT GLASS OF WATER VARIOUS ALKALOIDS MUST BE IN THE SUPPLY TO RESULT IN THOSE TASTES
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE WATER OR IS THE KETTLE CALCIFIED
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT A BRAIN TUMOUR
THIS FOR SOME REASON REMINDS ME THAT ONE EPISODE OF INVADER ZIM WHERE EVERYTHING THE GIRL EATS TASTES LIKE HOT DOGS
SOMEONE'S DONE A HITE IN THE KETTLE
HAVE YOU CLEANED YOUR KETTLE
DID YOU START USING A DIFFERENT SORT OF SEABAGS IT MAY BE DOING UNEXPECTED THINGS WITH YOUR WATER HENCE THE WEIRD TASTE

BEST OF LUCK THOUGH OLD PAL I'LL HAVE A CUPPA IN SOLIDARITY WITH YOU
ARE YOU IN BIRMINGHAM
GET YOURSELF A PERSONAL KETTLE AND KEEP IT IN YOUR ROOM A MINI FRIDGE FOR MILK WOULD ALSO NOT GO AMISS THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHARE ANY OF YOUR TEA MAKING FACILITIES WITH OTHER STUDENT BARBARIANS
IT'S PROBABLY THE FACT YOU USE SHIT SEABAGS TRY YORKSHIRE TEA OR TWINING ASSAM BLEND YOUR WALLET WON'T THANK ME FOR THAT SUGGESTION BUT YOU PROBABLY WILLIAM
THE WORST THING IS TAKING A BUS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND CATCHING ONE THAT DOESN'T ANNOUNCE ITS STOPS
STATION ROAD IS CLOSED MAYBE THE STATION IS CLOSED MAYBE SOCIETY IS CLOSED HEEEEEEELP
EVERYBODY STARTS LOOKING AROUND CHECKING TICKETS STARING AT EACH OTHER BUT NOBODY SAYS A THING
THAT MOMENT IT TURNS ONTO THE WRONG MAIN ROAD AND YOU ACCEPT YOUR FATE
IS IT JUST ME OR DID I JUST SEE THIS EXACT THING HERE ON R BRITISHPROBLEMS OR R UK A FEW WEEKS AGO
THIS IS WHY I FIND IT HANDY TO HAVE A COPY OF MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR ON MY PHONE TO PLAY THROUGH SPEAKERS JUST FOR THAT VERY OCCASION
YES THIS HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT AND THIS GUY WHO LIVES A FEW STREETS AWAY FROM ME AND WHO I VAGUELY KNOW ENOUGH TO SAY HELLO BUT NOT ENOUGH TO START CHATTING AND I EXCHANGED A MILDLY WORRIED CONFUSED LOOK WHEN THE BUS DRIVER WENT THE WRONG WAY
UNLESS IT'S THE SCHOOL BUS THEN EVERYONE CELEBRATES

HEH I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN SECONDARY SCHOOL AND WE HAD A GREEN DRIVER GAVE HIM ALL THE WRONG DIRECTIONS AND WENT ON A JOLLY TOUR ALL AROUND THE LOCAL AREA TURNED UP AT SCHOOL FINALLY ABOUT MINS LATE THAT WAS A GOOD DAY

COULDN'T DO THAT TODAY
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO REMIND ME OF THAT FEELING
STAND NEXT TO HIM AND OFFER ENCOURAGEMENT THROUGHOUT
KEEP MENTIONING YOUR HUSBAND WON'T BE HOME FOR HOURS AND KEEP FINDING REASONS TO REACH FOR THINGS ON HIGH SHELVES OR LOW CUPBOARDS NEAR HIM

CONTINUOUSLY APOLOGISE FOR NOT HAVING TIME TO GET DRESSED THIS MORNING AS THOSE BIG STRONG MANUAL WORKERS INSIST ON ARRIVING AT THE DOOR SO EARLY YOU'RE BARELY OUT THE SHOWER
JUST ASK DID YOU SEE THAT LUDICROUS DISPLAY LAST NIGHT
JUST LET HIM GET ON WITH IT THEY WON'T WANT YOU LINGERING AROUND SO JUST SAY I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS UPSTAIRS IN WHATEVER ROOM IF YOU NEED ME
LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND TAKE NOTES

AND JUST KEEP SAYING DON'T MIND ME JUST TAKING NOTES SO I CAN DO IT MYSELF NEXT TIME


I SWITCH ON MY LAPTOP AND PRETEND I'M DOING SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE OCCASIONALLY I DO SEND A FEW EMAILS
WELL ON PEEP SHOW THEY ANNOYED THE GUY TO THE POINT WHERE HE KNOCKED THE DOOR OFFICIAL SO I'D RECOMMEND LEAVING THEM TO IT
MAKE TEA EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR AND OFFER CHOCOLATE BISCUITS
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE USED TO HAVE FEATHER DUSTERS
OFFER THEM A CUP OF THEIR PREFERRED BEVERAGE AND TELL THEM WHERE YOU'LL BE IF THEY NEED YOU
I'LL BE AROUND THE HOUSE JUST GIVE ME A SHOUT IF YOU NEED ANYTHING KETTLES THROUGH THERE BISCUITS ARE IN THE TIN DOUGHNUTS ARE ON THE COUNTER

THEN GO DO WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING PREFERABLY NOT LOUDLY ANKING
I CAN NEVER SIT DOWN WHEN ONE IS OVER I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO STAND UP DDK WHY
I GENERALLY TELL THE LETTING AGENT TO LET HIM IN TAKE THE DAY OFF I WORK FROM HOME AND GO SIT IN THE LOCAL LIBRARY AND READ
YOU OFFER THEM A DRINK AND SLIP IN TO SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE THEN ASK IF THEY NEED ANY HELP WITH THEIR TOOL WELL THAT'S HOW IT GOES IN THE MOVIES I'VE SEEN ONLINE ANYWAY
WALK AROUND NAKED TO ASSERT YOUR DOMINANCE

WHENEVER POSSIBLE MAINTAIN ALL EYE CONTACT FOR AT LEAST SECONDS AFTER IT BEGINS TO GET UNCOMFORTABLE YOU NEED TO MAKE THEM LOOK AWAY FIRST IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION OF ALPHA MALE IN THE HOUSE
WAIT ESSEX AND HAVING CONTACTLESS I WAS THERE ONLY AN HOUR AGO WHY DIDN'T I NOTICE THIS MARVEL
ONLY LIKE A QUARTER OF THE SHOPS HAVE IT SO FAR

WE'RE A BIGGER STORE AND THE MANAGERS HAVE NO IDEA WHEN IT'S COMING BUT IT'S PERPETUALLY BEEN COMING SOON
I STILL PAY CASH

NO VISA YOU WILL NOT KNOW I JUST BOUGHT SOME TINNED MACKEREL AND A PACK OF CLUBS
THE PROBLEM WITH LEAVES ON THE TRACK IS THAT IT CREATES A MULCH ON THE TRACK WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BRAKE MOST TRAINS HAVE A GRIT SPRAY DEVICE WHICH HELPS WITH TRACTION FOR BREAKING AND ACCELERATION BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF PLOW DEVICE TO REMOVE THE CRAP FROM TRACKS BEFORE THE WHEELS TOUCH THEM LIKE HOW A SNOW PLOW WORKS
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THIS AUTUMN THING DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY YEAR THEY COULD PREPARE FOR IT THAT WAY
MAYBE A SURPRISE WILL BE BETTER THAN EATING THE SAME THING EVERY SINGLE WEEK
WHO USES THE PHONE IN THIS POST JUST EAT WORLD
I'M SCOTTISH WORKING IN ENGLAND I WAS GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CALLING IN A CHINESE ORDER FROM THE FOREIGN SOUNDING GUY FOR ABOUT OF US ONE NIGHT SHIFT THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH OF A MIX OF ACCENTS NOW THERE'S FOOD ORDER NERVES
THIS ANNOYS ME WHEN YOUR WHOLE BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON PEOPLE PHONING YOU AND RELAYING AN ORDER FROM A CHOICE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED MENU ITEMS MANY WITH UNUSUAL NAMES IT SEEMS COMMON SENSE TO EMPLOY SOMEONE WHO HAS A BASIC COMMAND OF ENGLISH
CO OP ASDA QUALITY AT WAITROSE PRICES
M AND S IS CHEAPER THAN BUYING FULL PRICE STUFF IN THE CO OP SOME OF THE DEALS THEY HAVE ARE GOOD THOUGH
I'M GLAD YOU HAVEN'T GOT A GUN
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
STILL SOME FUNDRAISER UNKNOWN WEATHERS AVAILABLE HERE MAKE GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENTS
FUCK YES BUYING NOW
SURELY A MENTAL HEALTH CHARITY SHOULD HAVE GOT IN ON THIS BEFORE OXFAM
TYPICAL BRITISH SHOWBOATING AT A PARTY SHE WAS DRUNK AND TRYING TO DO IT OVER HER SHOULDER WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE

VERY LUCKY HE DIDN'T LOSE AN EYE SAID THE COURTESAN TO THE VICAR
ONE WORD RAAAAAAA
COULD HAVE AT LEAST CUT HIS FINGERS OFF AND SPARED US FROM MORE OF HIS HITE MUSIC
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING STRAIGHT OUT OF THE WINDSORS
THESE TURING BOTS AREN'T GETTING ANY MORE CONVINCING
AT LEAST THEY'VE GOT RID OF THE TWAT OF A KID
THAT ADVERT WILL KEEP ME FROM IN GAGS FOR THE N TXT FEW WEEKS DON'T KNOCK IT
ALL THIS PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE COMING OUT AND ALL I WANT IS A HISPA MINT THAT'S ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS I'LL END MY CADBURYS BOYCOTT THE NEXT BEING KRAFT BUGGERING OFFICIAL
THAT'S A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT

PROOF PEANUT BUTTER CHUNKY
I HAVEN'T BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH A PEANUT BUTTER OFFERING SO FAR
I HATE PEANUT BUTTER SO I DO NOT APPROVE OF THIS TREND
SNICKERS ARE NICER VERSIONS OF MARS BARS
CAN'T HAVE BEEN THAT PACKED IF YOU HAD A SEAT AND YOUR ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT IT WASN'T THE BEST SEAT
I COULD PROBABLY PLUCK UP THE COURAGE TO MOVE IF I WAS ON THE TUBE BUT IT'S EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU'RE ON A BUS OR A TRAIN AND YOU'RE AT THE WINDOW SEAT THEN YOU HAVE TO ASK THE PERSON TO MOVE AS WELL
WHICH SEATS ARE THE BETTER ONES ANY SEAT IS A BLESSING FOR ME
WERE YOU BOTH INDULGING IN COITUS AT THE TIME
A STUDENT DRINKING A SOFT DRINK I THOUGHT YOU WERE ALL DOWN THE STUDENT UNION DRINKING SUBSIDISE BEER
MAYBE SOMEONE INCREASED THE STRENGTH OF YOUR TAP WATER
I STOPPED DRINKING IT FOR A FEW MONTHS BOUGHT A BOTTLE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND I'M STRUGGLING TO POUR A SMALL ENOUGH AMOUNT IN FOR IT NOT TO BE INCREDIBLY STRONG

SO YOUR TOLERANCE GUESS MAY BE CORRECT
SOUNDS LIKE THE OLD HORSERADISH PROBLEM TO ME
TELL THEM WHAT YOU'D LIKE FOR CHRISTMAS A NEW AND PRICEY KETTLE
FUCKING CUNTS
THAT GIVES YOU THE PERFECT EXCUSE NOT TO INVITE THEM ROUND AGAIN
TRY THE APPROACH ACCIDENTALLY DROP SOME HONEY OR JAM IN THE SWITCH ON THEIR KETTLE AT THE NEXT AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITY
I USED TO WHEN I WAS A KID AND THE YOUNG ONE'S EPISODE DIDN'T HELP
CERTAINLY

AND WHEN ANYONE BUZZED THE WHOLE STRUCTURE DESKS PLAYERS AND ALL RAPIDLY ZOOMED TOWARDS THE CAMERA
I DID AS A KID WORKED IT OUT AT SOME POINT WHICH FELT LIKE IT SPOILED SOMETHING ABOUT IT
PRETTY SURE PEOPLE ONLY WATCH IT NOW FOR SPOTTING THE FUTURE MURDERERS AND THE TOKEN WOMAN
YES RATHER IN THE MANNER OF CELEBRITY SQUARES STEPS STAIRS WERE SOMEHOW INVOLVED

AND YES I REALISE THAT THESE PROGRAMMES ARE POLAR OPPOSITES
THEY'RE NOT
WELL TIL
NO BECAUSE I WATCH FROM THE START
YOU SEE THEM NEXT TO EACH OTHER AT THE BEGINNING THE END AND SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT EACH EPISODE THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD THINK THEY WEREN'T SIDE BY SIDE IS IF YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY EVER WATCH IT
THEY CERTAINLY USED TO BE
WATCH V

NOT SURE IF THEY STILL ARE SINCE BAMBER GASCOIGNE QUIT

MOST MARSHMALLOWS STUCK UP ONE NOSTRIL
FOR A LONG TIME YES
I WON'T LIE I'VE ONLY SEEN THE YOUNG ONES PISSTAKE AND YES I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE LAYOUT

I'M NOT MIDDLE CLASS ENOUGH TO WATCH NORMAL UNIVERSITY CHALLENGE SCUMBAG COLLEGE ALL THE WAY
MAYBE HE HAS A VISION IMPAIRMENT OR SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIS EYE
HE COULD HAVE PHOTOSENSITIVE EPILEPSY WHERE I WORK THERE IS A GUY WHO HAS TO WEAR SUNGLASSES ALL THE TIME OR HE WILL HAVE A SEIZURE
I HAVE A VISUAL DISABILITY AND HAVE TO DO THIS AND IF IT HELPS IT MAKES ME FEEL REALLY SELF CONSCIOUS
SO WHAT MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
HANGOVER OR STONED PROBABLY
I DO THIS BECAUSE MY EYES ARE SENSITIVE TO BRIGHT LIGHT TYPICALLY TRAINS ARE VERY BRIGHT INSIDE
BE NICE TO STEVIE WONDER
I HATE THIS HOWEVER TO BE FAIR TODAY WAS GLORIOUS WEATHER IN LONDON THERE WERE TWO OCCASIONS WHERE I THOUGHT SUNGLASSES WERE NECESSARY THIS BEING SAID YOUR ON A TRAIN TWAT TAKE THE SUNGLASSES OFF
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU'RE COOL THE SUN SHINES ON YOU HOURS A DAY
I COULD HAVE DONE WITH SUNGLASSES TODAY SUN WAS RIDICULOUSLY BRIGHT BLINDED BY THE SUN BUT FREEZING COLD ALL DAY
NAH HE DIDN'T HAVE THEM ON TO BEGIN WITH WAS MESSING AROUND ON A TABLET ETC BEFORE PUTTING THEM ON I AM FULLY AWARE OF THE NEED FOR THEM FOR MEDICAL REASONS AS A WOMAN AT WORK WEARS THEM FOR MIGRAINES
TRAINLINE APP DID THE EXACT SAME THING TO ME THE OTHER DAY THE CONDUCTOR WAS GONNA COME BACK TO ME BUT ALAS NEVER DID
YEAH IT'S HAPPENED TO ME IT'S A PAIN IN THE ARSE MADE WORSE BY THE BUS BEING LATE TAKING AN AGE TO GET HOME AND TO TOP IT OFF ITS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE TRAIN
SAY EXCUSE ME IN INCREASING VOLUME UNTIL YOU GET A RESPONSE LOSE YOUR VOICE
YOU HAVE JUST ABOUT SUMMED UP THE HUMAN CONDITION MR
THAT IS A VERY BRITISH PROBLEM
THAT'S GONNA GET MESSY
DIDN'T KNOW SHOES NEEDED EMISSIONS TESTING
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW OUR WORK VAN PASSES IT'S MOT EVERY YEAR IF YOU PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
DON'T LET GO
JUST DON'T FORGET IT'S IN THERE WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR LAST GULP ACK
I SEE IT AS A LITTLE TREAT AT THE END OF MY DRINK
IN YOUR COFFEE OFF WITH YOUR HEAD
GREAT NAME FOR A SELECTION BOX OF CHRISTMAS CHOCOLATES THOUGH

ROSES QUALITY STREET HEROES CELEBRATIONS LITTLE MIX SEE IT WORKS
THEY WERE INITIALLY CALLED RHYTHMIC BUT HAD TO CHANGE IT AS THAT WAS ALREADY THE NAME OF A CHARITY PROBABLY A CHARITY FOR THE DEAF GIVEN IT'S A SAFE ASSUMPTION THEY HAVE THE SAME FOLLOWING
LITTLE MYXOMATOSIS IS MUCH BETTER
CAN'T GET WORSE THAN CLEAN BANDIT IN MY OPINION
I USED TO THINK THEY WERE CALLED LITTLE MINX WHICH AT LEAST SEEMED RIGHT GIVEN THE AGE GROUP THEY'RE MARKETED TO AND THE TYPE OF MUSIC
I THOUGHT THEY WERE IRISH UNTIL I SAW THE NAME WRITTEN DOWN
SOUNDS LIKE A CAT KIBBLE BRAND
WAS ALREADY TAKEN
I ONCE COMPARED LITTLE MIX TO THE ARSENAL BACK FOUR OF THE EARLY AND RECEIVED AT LEAST THREE PEETWEETS ON TWITTER TRUE STORY
NOT AS BAD AS OASIS
LITTLE MIX IS A BLOODY AWFUL NAME FOR A POP GROUP

FAFFY
THEY'VE GOT MILLIONS OF YOUNG GIRLS SINGING ALONG THEIR WITCHY DATE RAPE TUTORIAL

GET YOUR BOY ON HIS KNEES
AND REPEAT AFTER ME SAY
TAKE A SIP OF MY SECRET POTION
I'LL MAKE YOU FALL IN LOVE
FOR A SPELL THAT CAN'T BE BROKEN
ONE DROP SHOULD BE ENOUGH
BOY YOU BELONG TO ME
I GOT THE RECIPE
AND IT'S CALLED BLACK MAGIC
AND IT'S CALLED BLACK MAGIC

IF A POP BOGYLAND RELEASED THE EQUIVALENT IT WOULD CAUSE OUTRAGE


COULD BE WORSE THEY COULD HAVE RESURRECTED MINI POPS
THE NAME SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D CALL A SMALL BAG OF DOLLY MIXTURES OR AN ALDI IDL VARIANT
I SAW SOMEONE IN THE COMMENT SECTION OF THE DAILYMAIL CALL THEM LOL
BUT JUST THINK A GROUP OF LARGE WOMEN COULD START A PARODY POP GROUP CALLED BIG MIX
SHOULD HAVE CALLED THEMSELVES LITTLE TALENT INSTEAD
AN AWFUL NAME FOR AN AWFUL GROUP QUITE FITTING REALLY
OH BLESS SOME OF YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE EXPERIENCED THE LIVING FUCKING HELL THAT IS LINCOLN CHRISTMAS MARKET

I USED TO LIVE AROUND THE CORNER FROM IT HIGHLIGHTS BEING CLEANING VOMIT OFF MY DOORSTEP EVERY NIGHT 2 NOT BEING ABLE TO PARK WITHIN MILES OF MY HOUSE EVERY SINGLE STALL SELLS THE SAME FUCKING TAT
COME TO YORK OUR CHRISTMAS MARKET STARTS IN MID NOVEMBER UP UNTIL CHRISTMAS EVE YAY STANDSTILL IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN FOR ONE AND A HALF MONTHS
HAD TO CHECK YOU WEREN'T IN BURY ST EDMUNDS THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I DESCRIBED IT TO MY OTHER HALF
SHEFFIELD IS A BECKING DEATH MARCH DUE TO THE MARKET THIS TIME OF YEAR YOU'RE BUGGERED IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ANYWHERE FAST GETTING THROUGH THAT COMBINED WITH THE CLIPBOARD WARRIORS
DID YOU NOT ENJOY THE STALLS SELLING WELDED TOGETHER POT METAL POP CULTURE STATUES FOR QUID SMALL WOODEN THINGS YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IT IS AND ASSORTED INCENSE AND BUDDAH STATUES
JUST LIKE WINCHESTER
GAWPING
CHRIST COME TO ABERDEEN A MAIN ROAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY HAS ALREADY BEEN CLOSED FOR A WEEK TO PREPARE FOR THE CHRISTMAS MARKET IT OFFICIALLY OPENED ON FRIDAY AND WILL BE ON UNTIL JAN

SO WE HAVE A ROAD CLOSURE DIVERSIONS IN PLACE PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS A NIGHTMARE AND WE HAVE THE ISSUE AS DESCRIBED CUNTS WALKING SLOW IN A CROWD FOR TWO SOLID MONTHS
THE WAY ALL THE FOOD IS COMPLETELY OPEN TO THE WORLD WORRIES ME ESPECIALLY WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH COUGHS AND COLDS WANDERING AROUND PAST IT ALL I WOULDN'T TRUST ANYTHING EDIBLE BOUGHT FROM THERE UNLESS IT WAS PROPERLY COOKED IN FRONT OF ME
OH SHIT BIRMINGHAM IS GOING TO BECOME A NO GO ZONE WHEN THE MARKET KICKS IN
LIVERPOOL ISN'T TOO BAD THE KEEP THEM ALL ON A FEW STREETS FOR THE MOST PART SO AS LONG AS YOU DON'T NEED TO GO EXACTLY TO ONE OF THE SHOPS ON THEM YOU CAN AVOID THEM
AT LEAST YOU GET A CHRISTMAS MARKET WE HAVE TO TRAVEL AT LEAST MILES TO FIND ONE ST HELENS YES I KNOW THAT'S NOT ACCURATE
WILL THAT BE ONE OF THE STUBBY HAND MADE ONES IT'S A TO PICK THOSE UP FROM THE BARGAIN BUCKET WHEN THEY'RE AVAILABLE DID YOU BAKE IT FOR A BIT TO WARM IT UP FLIPPIN GORGEOUS
SOME PLEASURES ARE MEANT TO BE TRANSIENT IT'S LIKE NOSTALGIA FOR ALL THOSE SHOWS YOU LOVED AS A CHILD WHICH TURN OUT TO BE A BIT RUBBISH WHEN YOU THEM AS AN ADULT
GOT TO LOVE THE SHELF OF SHAME THE AMOUNT OF THINGS I HAVE TRIED THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE GIVEN A SECOND GLANCE TO DUE TO THE PRICE
THERE WILL NEVER BE A CHILLI SAUSAGE ROLL AS GOOD AS THAT ONE WAS
NICE TRY TESCO R HAILCORPORATE
ON A WHIM I BOUGHT A BLACK PUDDING AND CAMEMBERT I THINK SOME CHEESE ANYWAY SAUSAGE ROLL BECAUSE IT WAS I HAD TWO BITES AND THREW IT AWAY IT WAS VILE NOT SURE WHAT I EXPECTED
THE MODERN VERSION OF WANTING TO HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO
ROUTE AROUND THEIR BACK BINS FOR STUFF THAT PASSED IT'S SELL BY DATE THERE'S TONS OF DELICIOUS FOOD IN THOSE ALL READY TO BE JUNKED OR HOPEFULLY GIVEN AWAY TO THE NEEDY
BAH I'M SO JEALOUS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND GOOD SAUSAGE ROLLS IN THE USA BUT YOU CAN JUST GO BACK TO THE SUPERMARKET AND GET SOME FOR A PITTANCE THE ONLY PLACE I CAN FIND A DECENT SAUSAGE ROLL HERE IS AT THE PUB WITH BRITISH FOOD WHERE YOU CAN GET SOME AS AN APPETISER FOR
ALL LIFE IS A MEMORY BY THE TIME YOU SENSE ANYTHING IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED AND WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING IS ESSENTIALLY A MEMORY OF THE EVENT
I BOUGHT A COQUITO AND CHILLI JAM SAUSAGE ROLL AND IT JUST TASTED OF DISAPPOINTMENT
AIN'T NOTHING BETTER THAN A HOT AND SPICY SAUSAGE FROM THE DELI STUFFED INTO A PANINI FROM THE BAKERY WASHED DOWN WITH A CRAFT BEER
STOP SAYING SAID WHEN YOU MEAN IT OR THE
2 BUY ANOTHER ONE
THIS SUMMED UP MY LOVE YET APATHY FOR OUR GOOD GUARDIAN

NEWS MEDIA
PICKED SOME UP FROM LOCAL AT ABOUT PINTS FOR A QUID NOT THAT IT HELPS YOU BUT I CAN HAVE MY CEREAL IN MORNING
I LOVE SUNDAY TRADING HOURS I WORK IN RETAIL
GOD SAYS THAT IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN ONLY BUY A HAMMER WITHIN A HOUR WINDOW ON A SUNDAY
I HATE SUNDAY HOURS WHEN I'M FINISHED WORK AT AND I'VE FUCKING FORGOT TO BUY DINNER THE DAY BEFORE I'M EATING BACKUP PACKET NOODLES OR SOMETHING FROM THE CORNER SHOP LIKE A DISGUSTING RUSTLERS BURGER FOR DINNER

SOMEBODY PLEASE SCRAP THIS ANTIQUATED SYSTEM

THE WORST THING ABOUT SUNDAY TRADING HOURS IS THE MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE WHO SOMEHOW HAVE NEVER HEARD THEY EXIST AND DEMAND TO BE LET IN WHILST WE'RE SETTING UP THE SHOP AT ON A SUNDAY MORNING

NO I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT A NEW LAW SIR
IS UNREASONABLE TO WONDER WHY YOU DIDN'T BUY SOME YESTERDAY OR BEFORE OR SPEND AN EXTRA
I MISS LIVING IN SCOTLAND THEY DON'T HAVE THESE STUPID SUNDAY TRADING LAWS IF YOU WANT TO WANDER ROUND THE SUPERMARKET AT PM ON A SUNDAY YOU CAN CAUSE IT'S OPEN BRRR
WHAT'S THE REASONING BEHIND THESE RULES IS IT SO SMALLER COMPANIES AREN'T OUTSOLD BY LARGER SHOPS IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN WHY THE FUCK DOES THE NISA ROUND THE CORNER SHUT EARLIER THAN TESCO ON A SUNDAY
YET ANOTHER BENEFIT OF GREEN TEA
MY MAIN GRIPE IS THAT IS THE DAY I WANT TO MAKE A SUNDAY ROAST EVEN IF I AM ALL PREPARED THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING I END UP NEEDING AFTER EXTRA BASTO A FEW CANS OF BEER MUSTARD IF IT GETS TO AND I DECIDE I WANT A ROAST DINNER LIKE FUCK I AM GOING TO GO INTO A PACKED TESCO TO TRY AND FIGHT OVER A CHICKEN
WE HAVE A TESCO EXPRESS A FEW ROADS AWAY FOR MOMENTS LIKE THIS BUT OF COURSE AT ON A SUNDAY IT'S PACKED TO THE BRIM SO WE NEVER BOTHER
FOR PINTS OF MILK DOESN'T SEEM TOO BAD TO BE HONEST I USUALLY PAY THAT FOR THE RAVENDALE STUFF JUST SO IT LASTS MORE THAN A FEW DAYS
THE MILKMAN SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MARGINALISED
REMOVED
WHY NOT GO TO THE LOCAL CAFE RESTAURANT AND PINCH A FEW MILK TUBS
I THOUGHT WE BOUGHT STUFF IN LITRES THESE DAYS I'D GLADLY PAY A LOT MORE FOR MILK IF IT WENT TO THE FARMERS
IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE STARS ARE A RATING SYSTEM OR SOMETHING
IT'S A GOOD GAUGE FOR HOW FRENCH AND EXPENSIVE THE FOOD WILL BE
IT IS PERFECT IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT COMPLETE EXCELLENCE IN TERMS OF SERVICE PRESENTATION INNOVATION AND TASTE IT DOESN'T MEAN THIS IS OBJECTIVELY TASTIER FOOD THAN THE LITTLE TURKISH PLACE DOWN THE ROAD WHICH ROAST LAMB ON CHARCOAL IT IS BYO AND IT IS UTTERLY BLOODY AMAZING
YOU MEAN THAT'S NOT WHAT MICHELIN STARS AND AA ROSETTES ARE FOR

WELL AFTER YEARS AS A CHEF WORKING AT DOUBLE AA ROSETTE VENUES AND LEARNING FROM THE LIKES OF KEITH FLOYD MICHAEL CAINES I LEARNED SOMETHING NEW TODAY

I'LL STICK TO DODGY TRIPADVISOR REVIEWS TO GAUGE WHERE TO EAT FROM NOW ON
YOU NEED KEBAB ON THE WAY HOME OR YOU'LL GO HUNGRY
TECHNICALLY THAT'S THE POINT ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO LIMIT YOUR CHOICE OF DINING ESTABLISHMENTS TO HIGH SCORING RESTAURANTS SOME OF THE TASTIEST MEALS I HAVE EATEN WERE IN A LOCAL GREASY SPOON
ED BALLS
PAYING TRIBUTE IS SO FORMAL FOR A GUY WHO WAS DRESSED UP AS THE MASK ON PRIME TIME TELLY A FEW WEEKS BACK
THAT MAKES TWO THINGS HE'S NOT VERY GOOD AT THEN NO WAIT THREE HE'S NOT GREAT AT TWITTER EITHER
THEY DENY IT BUT I USED STRESSED USED LONG GONE NOW TO HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF ME CIRCA ABOUT IN MY PARTY FROCK WITH A WAGON WHEEL ON MY LAP A RARE TREAT AS I WASN'T ALLOWED SUCH THINGS AT HOME THE FROCK HAD A PAISLEY PRINT ON DARK GREEN AND GOT TURNED INTO A SKIRT AT THE WAGON WHEEL I HELD SPANNED PAISLEY DOTS STILL HAD THE SKIRT IN SAME QUESTION CAME UP WAGON WHEEL IN WAS SMALLER BY OF THE SPACE BETWEEN DOTS FUCKERS
TAKE IT FROM A THEY'VE SHRUNK A LOT
AS WELL I'M SURE THEY USED TO BE HUGE
ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT JUST YOUR HANDS GROWING
NAH YOU'RE RIGHT WAGON WHEELS ARE DINKY NOW
DID YOU BUY WAGON WHEELIES BY MISTAKE
THIS IS THE REAL TROUBLE WITH ALL THIS TOBLERONE BUSINESS NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHICH SWEETS WE CAN TRUST THE WHOLE SYSTEM WAS BUILT ON GOOD FAITH AND NOW IT'S IN DISARRAY
PROJECT

AND NO NOT REALLY APPARENTLY
WIKI
YOUR HANDS GOT BIGGER
I REMEMBER THEM FROM THE AND THEY USED TO BE HUGE BUT THEN I USED TO BE TINY
PRETTY MUCH ALL THE MAJOR CONFECTIONARY COMPANIES ARE REDUCING THE SIZE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND USING CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES LIKE PALM OIL INSTEAD OF COCOA BUTTER
BREVIT
SPEAKING OF WHICH BOURBONS PACKETS NEVER WENT BACK TO THEIR FULL SIZE AFTER THE BISCUIT SHORTAGE EARLIER THIS YEAR

THERE'S NOW AT LAST FEWER BOURBONS PER PACK
THIS IS WHAT BRITAIN VOTED FOR
I LOVE HOW YOU USED THE ABILITY TO FIT AN ENTIRE BISCUIT IN YOUR MOUTH AS A FORM OF MEASUREMENT
TAUT NOT TAUGHT
EVERYTHING IS SMALLER WITH FEWER IN A PACK THESE DAYS ALL CHOCOLATE ALL SWEETS ALL BISCUITS WE'RE GETTING ROBBED FROM EVERY ANGLE
AS SOMEONE THAT LIVES OUTSIDE OF LONDON I'VE NEVER SEEN A BUS ACCEPT ANYTHING OTHER THAN CASH
PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF LONDON CAN ONLY PAY WITH FISH GOATS AND GOOSEBERRIES AND DON'T FORGET THE MAGIC BEANS FOR THE LONGEST JOURNEYS
MIGHT NOT ACCEPT BUT HERE IN SHEFFIELD WE CAN PAY BY SHOWING TICKETS ON OUR PHONES THAT'S PRETTY NEAT
LIVING OUTSIDE LONDON IS SO FRUSTRATING USING THE BUS FOR THE CENTURY

LIVE TRACKING BARELY WORKS
OPERATORS WHO DON'T HAVE TICKETS WITHOUT HIGH COST
NO WAY TO FIND OUT FARES IN ADVANCE FOR A SINGLE JOURNEY
NO CARD PAYMENTS
THE FARES VARY IF THE DRIVER DOESN'T ADVANCE THE STAGE CORRECTLY
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO SERVICE GUARANTEE AND COMPLAINTS GET IGNORED WITH CONSISTENTLY LATE BUSES NOTHING EVER CHANGES
BUSES NEVER RUN IF THE TURNING BAD YET PEOPLE STILL DRIVE

AFTER EXPERIENCING ALL THE ABOVE I LEARNED TO DRIVE NEVER LOOKED BACK NEVER GOT ON A BUS SINCE
BUSES INSIDE OF LONDON NOT ACCEPTING CASH IS THE BIGGER PROBLEM
WHERE I LIVE WE HAVE ONE BUS AN HOUR TIMES A DAY MON SAT ONLY NO SUNDAY OR PUBLIC HOLIDAY SERVICE NO WINDY DAY RAINY DAY SNOWY DAY SERVICE NO APOLOGY WHEN THE DRIVER FORGETS THE ROUTE AND DOESN'T EVEN COME PAST OUR STOPS

ON THE ONE SIDE IT WOULD SEEM RATHER EXCESSIVE TO INSTALL A CONTACTLESS PAYMENT SYSTEM ON THE OTHER I IMAGINE ARRIA WILL DO PRECISELY THIS RATHER THAN RUN A PROPER SERVICE


I THINK THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS THAT LONDONERS ARE VENTURING OUTSIDE OF LONDON
THIS FOR A BRITISH PROBLEM HAVING MY TAX MONEY GO TO SUBSIDISE BUS TRIPS ABOUT TIMES MORE THAN THE REST OF US SO THEY CAN MOAN ABOUT NOT HAVING CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS THE ONE TIME THEY TAKE THE BUS ELSEWHERE
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW LONDON BUSES HAD CONTACTLESS
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE WHOLE COUNTRY HASN'T GONE FOR THE OYSTER CARD
APPARENTLY THEY ACCEPT CONTACTLESS ON FIRST BUSES IN CORNWALL TRIED IT ONCE DIDN'T WORK AND HAD NO CASH ESPECIALLY NOT FOR A SINGLE TO ON A MINUTE JOURNEY
OH MY GOD WHAT A PROBLEM AT LEAST YOU HAVE REGULAR PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN LIKE THE REST OF THE UK TRAINS ONCE AN HOUR BUSES ONCE AN HOUR TRY LIVING SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN LONDON
WHAT ELSE DO THEY SELL BESIDES FOOD
DON'T FORGET THEY ARE GERMAN STYLE MARKETS AND ARE OFTEN FILLED WITH BRITISH TRADES MEN AND WOMEN
MY MISSUS AND I DROVE MILES EACH WAY TO SHEFFIELD THIS WEEKEND SO THAT WE COULD GET A DECENT BURRITO SOMETIMES FOOD IS JUST WORTH IT
SOMEBODY IN BIRMINGHAM HAVE A CHEESE AND HAM PRETZEL ON MY BEHALF AND ONE OF THOSE JAGERMEISTER HOT CHOCOLATES
YAH
I GO TO BUY SOAP AS WELL BUT APART FROM THAT YEAH IT'S USUALLY THE FOOD
NOPE NOBODY GOES FOR THE NICKNACKS IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GARLIC BREAD EXOTIC MEAT BURGERS GLUHWEIN FRIED POTATOES SCHNITZEL PORK STEAKS BERLINERS BOOBIE BUNS DICKMANNS HOT DOGS
CIDER AND MULLED WINE PERSONALLY I ONLY GO SO I CAN BUY SOME AFTER EIGHT DONUTS

IT SEEMS TO GET SMALLER EVERY YEAR THOUGH
PROBABLY REST ARE THERE JUST FOR THE BOOZE I'M SURE AT LEAST THAT WAS WHAT THE FIGHT POLICE PRESENCE AND MULTIPLE USES OF THE EMERGENCY ALARM ON AND AROUND MY TRAIN HOME FROM BRUM LAST NIGHT SEEMED TO SUGGEST WASN'T PLEASANT FOR MY YOUNG CHILDREN
I AGREE THE MAJORITY OF THE STUFF THERE IS OVERPRICED GET A NICE CHEESE GARLIC BREAD OR A HOT DOG TO KEEP YOU WARM AND JUST ENJOY THE SIGHTS
I WALKED PAST A GRILLED BRATTIE STAND TODAY THEN I WALKED PAST A STAND SELLING ENORMOUS GRILLED POLISH SAUSAGES

THEN I WENT HOME ATE MY BEANS ON TOAST AND SWALLOWED MY SADNESS
IF YOU WALK FURTHER UP TOWARDS WHERE BIRMINGHAM LIBRARY USED TO BE WHERE VICTORIA SQUARE IS YOU WILL SEE THAT ALL THE GOOD STUFF IS HAPPENING UP THERE IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AT NIGHT
I THINK THE GOOD FOOD SHOW WAS ON AT THE NEC TOO
I GO TO MARKETS LIKE THAT FOR THE FREE SAMPLES FREE CHEESE AND SALAMI IS GREAT
I'VE BEEN THE PAST FEW YEARS

WENT UP THE OTHER DAY AND YEAH IT'S JUST FOOD REALLY THE ORNAMENTS AND STUFF ARE EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT THEY ARE

I STILL HAD AN OSTRICH BURGER THOUGH
I WENT IN ONE ON THE MOTORWAY AND THEY TOLD ME ALL THE BAKES STEAK AND OTHERWISE WERE COLD WHEN ASKED IF IT WAS OK I SAID YES IT WASNT OKAY I WARMED MY WIFES SAUSAGE AND BEAN ONE IN THE BABY FOOD MICROWAVE AND ATE MY COLD DEPRESSING FESTIVE BAKE WITHOUT HEATING IT I REGRETTED EVERYTHING
WAS IT A STEAK STEAK BAKE OR A CHICKEN STEAK BAKE
I PREFER MY CHICKEN BAKES COLD QUICKER TO EAT
I COULD MICROWAVE IT IF YOU WANT

AND I COULD STAB YOU IN THE NECK BUT WE ARE BOTH IN POLITE SOCIETY
I BOUGHT A PIZZA SLICE FROM A ONCE YOU LIVE AND LEARN

HOW DO YOU KNOW DID YOU PROD THEM ALL
YOU CAN GET A KETTLE IN SOMEWHERE LIKE ARGOS OR TESCO FOR LESS THAN A FIVER
IT'S A STUDENT HOUSE


GREAT YOU CAN ALL CHIP IN A QUID

AND THE KETTLE CAME WITH THE HOUSE


YOU'RE NOT BANNED FROM GETTING A CHEAP KETTLE YOURSELF
HOW MANY STUDENTS DOES IT TAKE TO CHANGE A KETTLE

TO PHONE THE LETTING AGENT TO POST IT TO REDDIN STILL WAITING ON THE FINAL COUNT
TESCO VALUE KETTLE
DON'T SEE IT AS COMPLAINING YOU'RE JUST LETTING THEM KNOW

IN THE MEANTIME ARGOS
DO THESE FACTORS EXPLICITLY PREVENT YOU FROM PURCHASING A KETTLE AND ALLOWING IT TO REMAIN IN THE KITCHEN
JUST USE THE MICROWAVE

TOP TIP IT'S FASTER IF YOU PUT THE SEABAG AND MILK IN FIRST THEN NUKE THE LOT
I WAS UPSTAIRS YESTERDAY THE DOOR BELL RANG I WENT STRAIGHT DOWN TO ANSWER IT MUST HAVE TAKEN ALL OF SECONDS AND THE DELIVERY DRIVER WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE VAN WITH THE PACKAGE READY TO FUCK OFF TO HIS NEXT STOP SHOCKING
USUALLY MEANS THERE WAS NO SPACE FOR THE PARCEL IN THEIR BAG THAT DAY
I GOT ONE OF THOSE FOR THREE PARCELS DURING THE WEEK I WENT TO COLLECT THEM TODAY FROM THE SORTING OFFICE AND THEY ONLY HAD TWO OF THEM THEY COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHY THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE THIRD ONE AND THAT IT'LL PROBABLY BE DELIVERED TOMORROW WHY ON EARTH WOULD THEY LEAVE ONE OF THREE PARCELS SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER TWO
IS THE DROP-OFF POINT A SECURE LOCATION PARCEL COULD REQUIRE A SIGNATURE
THERE MUST BE SOME SORT OF MISLEADING PACKAGING REGULATIONS THAT THEY'RE FALLING FOUL OF THE ONLY ONE THAT'S THE SAME SIZE AS THE PICTURE IS THE CHOCOLATE ECLAIR HETP

NO FUDGES IN THAT PHOTO BECAUSE SOMEONE ATE THEM ALL
I MADE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING ONE A FEW WEEKS BACK NEVER AGAIN
I ALWAYS FOUND THE FACT THAT OF THE HEROES ARE JUST PLAIN OLD CHOCOLATE ABSOLUTELY APPALLING WHERE'S THE NUTS I ASK
I HATE THEIR NEW WRAPPING AS WELL
CADBURYS ROSES HAVE DONE THE SAME MASSIVE WRAPPERS AND THE PLASTIC BOX IS SLIGHTLY SMALLER AT THE BOTTOM BUT STILL THE SAME PRICE THE THINK PEOPLE ARE STUPID AND WON'T NOTICE
BE HAPPY AS YOU SEE THAT BATTLEFIELD TRAILER OF FOOTAGE FOR THE TIME
OH THANK HEAVENS IT'S NOT JUST ME ALL THESE YEARS I THOUGHT I WAS GOING CRAZY BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET HEINZ TINS TO STACK PROPERLY
MY GOD AS A RETAIL WORKER IT PISSES ME OFF TO NO END PART OF THE JOB IS TO MAKE THE SHELVES LOOK PRESENTABLE WHICH OFTEN MEANS STACKING TINS BEANS NO PROBLEM OWN BRAND STUFF PIECE OF CAKE BUT HEINZ IS LIKE TRYING TO STACK FINE CHINA ONE WRONG FLICK OF THE FINGER AND TWO DOZEN CANS CLUTTER ONTO THE FUCKING FLOOR

RANT
THE TRICK IS TO BUILD A BASE LAYER OF HEINZ CANS THEN PUT OTHER BRAND CANS ON TOP THEY SLOT RIGHT IN
I READ AGES AGO CAN'T FIND A SOURCE NOW THAT HEINZ TINS ARE INTENTIONALLY NOT STACKABLE AS THEY WANT SUPERMARKETS TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR BRANDED CARDBOARD TRAYS THAT WAY THE HEINZ LOGO IS MORE VISIBLE AND PINGS OUT ON THE SHELVES

CLEVER REALLY I GUESS WHAT ISN'T SO CLEVER IS WHEN SUPERMARKET STAFF TAKE THEN OUT OF THE TRAYS AND TRY TO PRECARIOUSLY BALANCE THE TINS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
I EMAILED THEM ABOUT THIS ONCE

HI JACKASH

THANK YOU FOR GETTING IN TOUCH ABOUT OUR CANNED PRODUCTS STACKING

IN GENERAL OUR TYPE OF FOODSTUFFS IS PROCESSED BY A METHOD USING SPIRAL COOKER COOLERS THIS PROCESS REQUIRES THE STRENGTH AND SCUFF RESISTANCE OF THE DOUBLE SEAM ON EACH END OF THE CAN

ALL CONSUMER FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS RECEIVED ARE IMPORTANT TO US AT HEINZ OUR PACKAGING AND DEVELOPMENT TEAM HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED

REGARDS

DIANE
THERE'S A REASON THE TINS AISLE AT THE SUPERMARKET I USED TO WORK WAS CALLED AISLE
YOU CAN AFFORD MORE THAN ONE TIN OF HEINZ YOUR FLAGRANT OPULENCE ASTOUNDS ME
AND THAT'S WHY I BUY BRAINSTONE BETTER BEANS AND STACKABLE CANS FOR NOW
OH SO THIS IS WHY ASDA KEEP THEM IN THE CARDBOARD TRAYS
I GLUE A STRONG MAGNET TO EACH CAN AND ATTACH THEM TO THE FRIDGE DOOR SIMPLE AND CONVENIENT
THEY'VE GOT TOO BIG FOR THEIR BEANY BOOTS AND THINK THEY'RE THE APPLE OF TINNED GOODS WHICH THEY PROBABLY ARE I MEAN BEANS MEANS HEINZ AFTER ALL
CAN CONFIRM THAT AUSTRALIAN HEINZ CANS DO STACK

THE COLONIES ARE OUTPACING YOU
IVE NEVER NOTICED THAT PROMPTLY WENT TO CHECK WITH HEINZ TINS IN MY CUPBOARD AND ITS TRUE THEY DON'T STACK
KNOWING THIS MAKES ME EVEN LESS LIKELY TO BUY HEINZ BEANS NOT THAT I WAS GOING TO BUY THEM WHO WOULD WHEN ALDI BEANS ARE SUPERIOR AND A FRACTION OF THE PRICE
IMAGINE THE PAIN OF SOMEONE WHO HAS TO FILL THE SUPERMARKET SHELVES
YOU LEARN TRUE HATRED WHEN YOU WORK RETAIL AND HAVE TO STACK THEM EVERY SHIFT
THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE BUTTON MOON ROCKET OUT OF IT AGAIN THEN
HEINZUK LET THEM KNOW OUR DEMANDS
PROBLEM SOLVED DON'T BUY HEINZ
I NEVER BUY HEINZ BEANS SUPERMARKET OWN BRANDS USUALLY TASTE BETTER AND ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER
YOU HAVE TO GO FOR AN ALTERNATING STAGGERED CHECKERBOARD PATTERN
THAT'S REALLY ODD IN AUSTRALIA AT LEAST FOR HEINZ BAKED BEANS IN HAM SAUCE THEY STILL STACK I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THEY ARE EASILY BALANCED I MEAN THEY INTERLOCK BY SEVERAL MM AND ARE VERY STABLE
THEY HAVE EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED THIS WITH THEIR MINI TINS YOU CAN BUY A PACK OF BAKED BEANS AND THEY'RE PACKAGED HORIZONTALLY INSTEAD OF ON TOP ONE ANOTHER
YES THIS PISSES ME OFF SO MUCH BLOODY BEAN TINS NOT STACKING PROPERLY AND THEN TOPPLING OVER
I HEARD THAT IT WAS SO THAT A CAN OPENER COULD BE USED TO OPEN THEM AT THE BOTTOM IF THE FAILED

SHRUG
AND WHAT'S THEIR SECRET INGREDIENT

WHY IT'S SUGAR OF COURSE
NEVER MIND TINS FUCK SNAP POTS

I LIVE ON MY OWN AND RARELY WANT A FULL TIN OR EVEN A TIN'S WORTH IN QUICK SUCCESSION BEFORE THEY'RE OFFICIAL INDIVIDUAL PORTIONS WOULD BE IDEAL

EVEN ON OFFER SNAP POTS ARE KG A NORMAL TIN OF BEANS AT IS KG

I COULD THROW AWAY A THIRD OF EVERY NORMAL TIN OF BEANS I BUY AND STILL BE QUIDS IN VS BUYING POTS I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THEY ARE PROPORTIONALLY THAT MUCH MORE TO MANUFACTURE
MAYBE THEY'RE ENCOURAGING YOU TO EAT FRESH NOT CANNED JUST I THOUGHT
I AM NOT CONVINCED SHE'S NOT JUST PETER KAY TRYING TO REVITALISE HIS CAREER AGAIN
HONEY G I SAW TWO MINUTES OF WHILE FLICKING THROUGH THE CHANNELS AND I THOUGHT EDINA MONSOON WAS DOING SOMETHING FOR COMIC RELIEF I WAS HOPING FOR PATSY TO COME ON
LAO HADN'T MADE THIS CONNECTION TILL YOU SAID THAT NOW I CAN'T GET THAT THOUGHT OUT MY HEAD HAVE AN UNVOTE FROM ME FOR MAKING ME LAUGH OUT LOUD
HONEY G HAS TO BE THE WORST EVER X FACTOR PERSON I THOUGHT IT WAS A WIND-UP FOR ABOUT THE FIRST MONTH OF SEEING HERALDRY STUDENTS VOTING TO KEEP HER IN FOR A ARF NO DOUBT
DO A LITTLE GOOGLING PATSY ONCE DID A LITTLE STRIPTEASE ON COMIC RELIEF SHE WAS INSANELY HOT AT THE TIME
SO YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE
DO YOU LIVE IN AN OFFICE BREAK ROOM
YOU ARE EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THE WORLD









CAN I HAVE A GO
HAVING A HOT TAP NO MATTER HOW HOT IT IS IS NO EXCUSE FOR NOT HAVING A KETTLE IT'S LIKE SAYING I DON'T HAVE A ROOF BECAUSE I'VE GOT A RAINCOAT
DON'T YOU HAVE AN EMERGENCY KETTLE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SURVIVE THE UP COMING ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE
DOES IT ACTUALLY SPIT OUT BOILING WATER
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE PREMISE OF SPENDING HUNDREDS ON QUOOKER WHEN THERE'S A PERFECTLY GOOD KETTLE BEHIND ME
I HAVE ONE AT WORK VERY CONVENIENT FOR DODGING SMALL TALK
WE'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE STANDALONE WATER BOILERS THAT MEANS WE CAN HAVE BOILING HOT WATER WITHOUT WAITING








WE STILL OWN A KETTLE THOUGH
WOW YOU CAN EVEN PREPARE YOUR TOMATOES
AREN'T THEY HIDEOUSLY EXPENSIVE TO RUN
DO YOU SWEETEN YOUR ROOBOIS WITH POMEGRANATE MOLASSES
LET THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF A SONG BE MINUTES AND SECONDS OR SECONDS

DAYS HAVE APPROXIMATELY HOURS OR MINUTES OR SECONDS

ASSUMING THAT THE NUMBER OF TIMES HEARD IS EQUAL TO THE TOTAL OF BOTH JAMES ARTHUR AND LITTLE MIX SECONDS

THEREFORE MY CONCLUSION IS THAT ENDLESS REPETITION OF MUSIC BY CAPITAL FM HAS DRIVEN YOUR MIND TO SKEW IT'S PERCEPTION OF TIME BY APPROXIMATELY THE NORMAL RATE
RADIO AND 2 ARE NO BETTER RADIO ESPECIALLY
I THINK LITTLE MIX SHOULD BE LEPRECHAUNS
WHO THE FUCK IS JAMES ARTHUR
CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY THAT IT'S NOT SMOOTH
THINK YOURSELF LUCKY I'VE HAD TO PUT UP WITH FAT MIDDLE AGE WOMEN FM HEART FOR FUCKING YEARS
I LISTEN TO ABSOLUTE CLASSIC ROCK

AT LEAST WITH ABSOLUTE YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE REPEATING THE SAME SONG MORE THAN ONCE IN A DAY IT'S A DAMN GOOD SONG
HANG IN THERE PERHAPS ONE DAY LITTLE MIX WILL REALIZE THAT THEIR MUSIC IS JUST GLORIFIED SHOUTING BUT UNTIL THAT DAY I LEND YOU MY STRENGTH BROTHER
HEART EXTRA XMAS GET IN THE OFFICE EARLY
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A RADIO ON AT WORK CONSIDERING WE SELL THEM ALTHOUGH EVEN IF WE DID PUT ONE ON IT WOULD BEE NBC OF ALL THINGS AND TRYING TO LISTEN TO ANYONE BUT JAMES O'BRIEN FOR HOURS WOULD MAKE ME NOT WANT TO WORK MUSIC STATIONS WOULD BE NO GO SINCE EVERYONE AROUND ME IS ETHER OLD OR INDIAN THANK GOD FOR HEADPHONES AND SO I CAN SURVIVE MY DAY WITH SUBTLE DRUM AND BASS IN MY LEFT EAR
I FEEL YOUR PAIN MATE MY CO-WORKER ALWAYS HAS HEART FM ON IN THE CAB ALL DAY EVERYDAY AND I CAN'T SEE HOW ANY HUMAN DJ COULD REPLY THE SAME SONGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO NOW I THINK ITS A ROBOT WHO IS BEHIND THIS REPETITIVE MADNESS
I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD GO ON WITH MY DAY IF I MISSED THE JEREMY VINE SHOW AT WORK
OH GOD I FEEL FOR YOU I HAD TO LISTEN TO HEART FM DAILY FOR FOUR HOURS FOR OVER A YEAR ONE TIME
I'VE HATED CAPITAL SINCE WHEN THEY SPONSORED A LUTHER VANDROSS CONCERT AND I HEARD THE SAME ADVERT EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES OF EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH I'VE NEVER TURNED THEM ON SINCE AND I THINK MY LIFE IS BETTER FOR IT RADIO KISS VIRGIN HEART THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ABSOLUTE DO A NEVER PLAYED TWICE IN A DAY THEME BUT THE SONGS EACH DAY ARE LARGELY THE SAME

MUSIC RADIO IN THIS COUNTRY DROVE ME TO LISTEN TO RADIO FOR THE LAST YEARS AND I DON'T MISS IT ONE BIT
HOW ABOUT MUSIC
I WORK IN A LORRY AND THE ONLY RADIO STATION THE DRIVERS EVER PLAY ARE HEART I'VE HEARD LMFAO AND ED BUNTING SHEERAN MORE TIMES THAN ANY MAN SHOULD HAVE TO ENDURE
WE TEND TO HAVE RADIO X ON IN THE HANGAR AT WORK NOT GREAT BUT I FIND THE MUSIC MORE VARIED AT LEAST
AS YOU SHOULD RADIO IS POISON
MY WORK HAS ITS OWN ORIGINAL TALENT WHO CAN'T SING OR WRITE SONGS THEY PLAY A HOUR LOOP MY SHIFTS ARE HOURS
THIS IS WHY RADIOS AT WORK ARE BAD UNLESS IN A VERY SMALL GROUP WHO CAN REALLY AGREE I CAN HANDLE RADIO 2 FOR A BIT BUT AND CAPITAL ARE JUST ENDLESS SOURCES OF CRAP NOISES AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED

FORTUNATELY AT MY WORK WE CAN WEAR HEADPHONES TO GET OUR MUSIC DELIVERED PERSONALLY
I WOULD FROWN AT YOU IF YOU ASKED FOR RADIO OR 2 I MIGHT EVEN TUT AT YOU
DON'T LEAVE OUT SAUCER-EYED RICTUS OF HORROR
COOKING DOESN'T GET ANY TOUGHER THAN THIS
I LOVE THESE

HALF OF THEM ARE PROPERLY BONKERS BUT THAT'S WHAT'S SO GOOD ABOUT THEM


YOU REMINDED ME OF THAT ADVERTISEMENT

WATCH V
TAKES WATCHING TELLY TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL
COULD THIS BE THE START OF A MASTER CHEF DRINKING GAME
OR A TWEEL WTF IS A TWEEL
YOU CAN TELL IT'S ABOUT RANGE ROVERS BECAUSE IT SAYS YOUR ROVER THAT I KNOW YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOBODY CAN'T AFFORD A ROVER I ONCE GOT A ROVER FOR FREE
I THOUGHT IT DID MEAN ROVER
REMINDS ME OF A GOLD WITH COOK PASS BABTRIDGE DOWN THE SIDE
MAKES A BIT MORE SENSE NOW I WONDERED WHO THE FUCK WAS A STILL BUYING ROVERS AND B COULDN'T AFFORD THEM
UNTIL READING THIS I HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE REFERRING TO A RANGE ROVER THAT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE EVERY TIME I HEAR IT I WONDERED WHY ANYONE YOUNG WOULD BUY A ROVER
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE A TEENAGER HAVE YOU TRIED PICTURING A PENSIONER IN THE ROVER
WAIT THEY AREN'T ON ABOUT A ROVER
THERE'S ME THINKING IT WAS JUST AN ANACHRONISTIC REFERENCE TO A ROVER
FINALLY

I THINK THIS EVERY TIME I HEAR THIS SONG FOR SOME REASON I ALWAYS PICTURE A ROVER

I BLAME BREVIT MYSELF EVEN POP RAP STARS HAVE HAD TO SWITCH FROM FLASH CARS TO SHIT BRITISH SECOND HAND ONES
IT DIDN'T CLICK WITH ME EITHER UNTIL RECENTLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE NOT BITE DREADFUL SONG JUST UTTER BILGE
IT'S A SHIT SONG AND ANNOYS ME SOLELY BECAUSE OF THIS
AS A YEAR OLD MY FIRST CAR WAS A ROVER
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY ABOUT THE FUCKING PUSSYWAGON
I ALWAYS JUST THOUGHT THEY WERE ON THE MOON OR SOME SHIT
I HATE THE LYRICS IN THAT SONG

WHY WOULD YOU BITE A TATTOO ON YOUR SHOULDER OF ALL THE THINGS TO STEAL WHY WOULD IT BE A MATTRESS
BRITISH

NOT WORSHIPPING THE ROVER
THAT SONG ANNOYS THE FUCKING SHIT OUT OF ME THE FIRST LINE OF THE LYRICS HEY YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS IT WAS NICE TO MEET THEM
BUT I HOPE I NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST AUNTY SOUNDING SONG LYRICS EVER
AFTER BEING PICKED FROM THE SCHOOL XMAS DISCO
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE NO ROOM IN THE BACK OF A PRINCESS I THOUGHT THEN MY MIND STARTED TO WANDER ABOUT HOW MUCH ROOM THERE IS IN THE BACK OF AN ACTUAL PRINCESS AN HOUR LATER I FORGOT WHERE I WAS
WILL SOME KIND PERSON ELI PLEASE WHAT IS THE SONG AND WHO IS IT BY
OH IT'S ABOUT RANGE ROVERS BEEN SO CONFUSED ABOUT THAT
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT A ROVER THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MAINTAIN CAUSE IT'S FUCKING FALLING APART
I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL HOW ANYONE THINKS A RANGE ROVER IS A COOL CAR THEY'RE UGLY AND NON-PERFORMANCE TO BOOT
I HAD TO GOOGLE THOSE LYRICS TO FIND OUT WHERE IT WAS FROM I WAS EXPECTING A RAPPER BUT NO I FOUND THE MOST WHITE MIDDLE AMERICA WET LETTUCE SONG I HAVE HEARD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE

AND IT HAS VIEWS WHAT KIND OF SOGGY FLANNELS ARE LISTENING TO THIS

BUT YEAH THEY ARE AMERICAN WHERE ROVER IS ALWAYS SHORT FOR RANGE ROVER THEY NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE FINEST
I STILL PICTURE THAT MAKES IT AT LEAST SEMI BEARABLE TO HEAR BECAUSE NOW I CAN HAVE A GIGGLE AT IT
I DIDN'T REALISE IT WASN'T A ROVER I THOUGHT IT WAS BEING DELIBERATELY RELATABLE NOW I KNOW IT ISN'T THAT ANNOYS ME NOW
EVERY TIME I HEAR THAT DAMN SONG I THINK OF A ROVER INSTEAD OF A RANGE ROVER NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS THIS PROBLEM
NOT MANY TEENAGERS WITH ROVER HANDS DOESN'T REALLY RHYME EITHER
HANG ON IT WAS A RANGE ROVER THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT I THOUGHT MAYBE HER ROVER HAD BROKEN DOWN AGAIN
I AGREE
ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WHEN HEARING THAT SONG I DO LIKE IT THOUGH

THERE'S NOTHING GLAMOROUS ABOUT A ROVER
THIS WHOLE TIME I'VE BEEN IMAGINING A CLASSY ROVER I LA JEREMY CLARKSON SERIES
THANKS FOR CLEARING THAT UP I THOUGHT THE LYRIC WAS NOVA INSTEAD OF ROVER THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO IN A BACKSEAT OF A NOVA
I HAD A ROVER OR WAS IT A PRETTY SHITTY CARS BUT I REMEMBER THE TOP AREA ABOVE THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT WAS FLAT LIKE A TABLE SO VERY PRACTICAL FOR STORING BONGS ON AND ROLLING SPLIFFS
I HAVE JUST THIS SECOND UNDERSTOOD THESE LYRICS I GENUINELY BELIEVED IT WAS AN OLD ROVER THINKING THAT IT WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS STONE COLD BROKE WHO CAN'T EVEN AFFORD A SHITTY YEAR OLD CAR
DAD HAD A ROVER A FEW YEARS AGO DECENT CAR UNTIL THE STARTER MOTOR DIED
AND THERE WAS I THINKING THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS
THANK GOD I HADNT HEARD THAT SONG

EDIT WELL CANT SAY THAT ANYMORE COCK
WHAT ALWAYS GETS ME IS THIS IF YOU'RE NEW TO AN AREA AND DON'T KNOW THE BUS ROUTES LOCAL GEOGRAPHY HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO PRESS THE BUTTON I JUST FIND MYSELF STARING AT GOOGLE MAPS FOR THE WHOLE JOURNEY IN THE HOPE THAT I TIME IT RIGHT BUT OBVIOUSLY YEARS AGO THAT WASN'T REALLY AN OPTION
NO MID-RIVER I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU TO HIT THE BRAKES IMMEDIATELY AFTER I PUSHED THE BUTTON I ACTUALLY MEANT THE NEXT BUS STOP OH SORRY THAT'S NOT MY BUS STOP IT'S THE ONE AFTER THIS ONE SORRY I PRESSED THE BUTTON AGAIN BECAUSE THERE WERE NO PEOPLE AT THE STOP AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE GOING TO REMEMBER ME AND STOP THERE ANYWAY OK YOU WIN JUST DON'T GIVE ME THAT FILTHY LOOK
AND THEN THERE'S THE PRECOCIOUS YEAR-OLD WHO KEEPS PRESSING THE BLOODY BUTTON FOR EVERY SINGLE STOP
PSST JUST TURN IT OVER

WILL LIFE EVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
I'D BE MORE CONCERNED THAT IT HAD KETCHUP ON IT'S BROWN SAUCE FOR BACON BUTTIES
WHAT THE FUCK IS KETCHUP I HAVE TOMATO SAUCE IN MY HOUSE
THAT'S A SHOCKING STATISTIC I WONDER IF IT COULD BE SOLVED SIMPLY BY GOVERNMENT ISSUE KETTLES AIRLIFTED IN BY THE ARMY OR IS IT MORE OF A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE IT'S A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT PERSONALLY I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A MONTHLY RATION OF YORKSHIRE AND A BAG OF TATE LYLE DELIVERED MONTHLY TO EVERY HOUSE GRATIS
DO THEY COUNT AS BRITISH HOMES IF THERE ISN'T A KETTLE SURELY THIS IS A KIND OF NO TRUE BRITON THING
THE OTHER HAD THE KETTLE ON THE BLINK AND HAD TO USE THE STOVE AS A REPLACEMENT FOR TR EVENING
ONLY IMMIGRATION NOT BAD
JUST TOLD MY FIANCE THIS AND HER RESPONSE WAS WHAT DO THEY DO FOLLOWED BY THEY MUST HAVE TEA MUST USE A PAN OR SOMETHING SHE COULD NOT COMPREHEND A LIFE WITHOUT TEA
I RECENTLY MOVED INTO A HOUSE SHARE AND THERE WASN'T A KETTLE IN SIGHT WE HAD SOME WORK DONE AND THE BUILDERS WENT OUT BOUGHT A KETTLE AND LEFT IT FOR US WHEN THEY LEFT BECAUSE THEY PRESUMABLY PITIED US SO MUCH WE ARE NOW THE
DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD RENT KETTLES
FOUND ONE

I CAN'T ASK ANYONE IN MY FAMILY TO PUT THE KETTLE ON BECAUSE WE OWN A BOILING WATER TAP
I'M PART OF THE FIGHT ME
SCUM
HOW DO THEY SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS
I OWN A KETTLE WHICH GETS USED FOR HOT DRINKS MAYBE ONCE A YEAR THE REST OF THE TIME IT IS USED ONLY FOR COOKING MAYBE THESE PEOPLE PREFER TO JUST USE THE HOB FROM THE START
BRITAIN HAS POWER SOCKETS WHICH ALLOWS US TO USE KETTLES
THE REST OF THE WORLD APPEARS TO NOT BE ABLE TO USE THEM WITH THEIR MISERABLE

DON'T DRINK TEA COFFEE OR HOT CHOCOLATE I HAVE NO NEED FOR A KETTLE AND IN FACT AM PART OF THIS


I SAW ON COMMENT ON REDDIN ONCE THAT INDICATED PEOPLE SHOULDN'T THINK OF US BRITISH AS TEA DRINKERS ONE AND ALL THEY WERE VERY UPSET BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD THEM THEY WERE A TEA DRINKING NATION HOW RUDE LOL
I DON'T HAVE A KETTLE I HAVE A BOILING WATER TAP INSTEAD IT'S THE FUTURE
I'M AND I'VE HONESTLY NEVER USED A KETTLE I DON'T LIKE ANY HOT DRINKS
DELETED
I USE MY KETTLE FAR LESS THAN I USE MY ESPRESSO PUMP
SIGH M
AT LEAST IT WASN'T A SPORTS DIRECT MUG SO YOUR KITCHEN DIDN'T FLOOD
YOUR FLAIR WAS WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE
THAT SUCKS WHAT MUG WAS IT
MAYBE TIME TO STICK THE HEATING ON
THIS IS ACTUALLY WHY MILK USED TO GO IN FIRST MAKES THE TEA TASTE AWFUL THOUGH
I HAD THIS BEFORE IF YOU WANT TO AVOID THIS IN THE FUTURE POP IT IN THE MICROWAVE FOR TEN SECONDS ASSUMING THE MUG IS MICROWAVABLE
THIS HAPPENED TO ME A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO NOW IN THE WINTER I ALWAYS POUR A LITTLE WARM WATER FROM A HALF BOILED KETTLE TO WAM THE MUG FIRST
THAT MEANS IT'S TIME TO TURN THE HEATING ON A WEEK AGO I DREAD TO THINK OF THE HORRORS THAT YOUR WATER PIPES ARE GOING THROUGH IF THAT WAS WHAT YOUR MUG DID
YOU'RE NOT IN MY OLD HOUSE ARE YOU
MY HOUSE GETS SO COLD THIS IS ALWAYS MY FEAR I JUST PUT MY MUG ON THE STOVE NEXT TO THE KETTLE TO HEAT UP WHILE THE BOILING
OH MY GOD I'VE NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED THIS BEFORE I'M GOING TO HAVE TO START WARMING UP MY MUGS MY LUCKY STREAK WILL SURELY END AT SOME POINT
THAT'S WHY THE MILK GOES IN FIRST
DELETED
AIN'T GOT NO HEAT
WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU BE PUTTING BOILING WATER IN A CUP

FOR COFFEE YOU PREHEAT THE CUP ADD THE SHOT AND THEN ADD WATER AT DEGREES AND OR FROTHED MILK ALSO AT DEGREES

FOR TEA JUST USE FROTHED MILK AT SLIP A BAG IN AND LET IT STEEP FOR MINUTES

THERE'S NO CASE FOR USING BOILING WATER AT ALL BECAUSE THAT BURNS THE COFFEE TEA MAKING IT BITTER AND NOT AS NICE DEGREES ALL ROUND WHETHER MILK OR WATER

EDIT PERSONALLY WHEN I MAKE COFFEE I PUT THE COFFEE IN LAST SO I CAN HAVE THE LOVELY GOLDEN CBEMA PRESERVED AT THE TOP OF THE CUP INSTEAD OF BEING MIXED IN

EDIT 2 TIL THAT BY NOT BURNING OUT ALL THE AMINO ACIDS AND GOODNESS FROM MY DRINKS I'M DOING IT WRONG FINE IF YOU FOLK LIKE IT BITTER GO AHEAD AND ENJOY I'LL ENJOY MY MAXIMUM FLAVOUR CHAI AND NIGH PERFECT CARAMEL AMERICANO IN PEACE IT'S CHEMISTRY AT PLAY AND SOMETHING OF AN ARCFORM THIS TAKES PATIENCE AND CARE NOT JUST SOMETHING YOU SLAP TOGETHER COMPARE COSTA COFFEE TO GREGGS COFFEE GREGGS COFFEE IS MADE WITH BOILING WATER YOU CAN TELL IT'S MUCH MORE BITTER THAN COSTA COFFEE DECENT QUALITY IN A PINCH AND IT'S ALSO FRESH BUT THE FLAVOUR IS MOSTLY BURNED OUT
PRETTY SURE THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE PROGRAMME BEING MADE WAS TO EDUCATE INFORM AND ENTERTAIN

PARTICULARLY SINCE EVERY EPISODE IN THE SERIES HAS ENDED WITH SOME SORT OF MESSAGE WARNING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE DAMAGE IT CAN CAUSE

FILMING IN WAS JUST A NATURAL DECISION GIVEN THE TECHNOLOGY CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
BBC DOESNT BROADCAST IN ANYWAY

WILL BE FILMED IN TO FUTURE PROOF AND SO THEY CAN POP OUT A FANCY BLURRY IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS
UNLESS YOU HAVE A TV IN EXCESS OF YOU WON'T NOTICE
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT BROADCAST IN EITHER SO WATCHING IT LIVE WOULDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE

NEWS 2 IN

IT'S FUNNY THOUGH THE ALBUM CHARTS ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT TO THE SINGLES GO INTO BMV AND YOU'LL SEE OLDER ARTISTS HIGH UP THAT YOU'D NEVER SEE IN THE SINGLES CHART THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY ARTIST OVER THE AGE OF SELLING MANY SINGLES YET THE ALBUM CHART IS MORE DIVERSE
I LONG FOR THE DAYS OF SATURDAY NIGHT AT
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN HEARD OR SO MARKS THE POINT AT WHICH PEOPLE DECIDE ALL CHART MUSIC IS HITE AND IT WAS MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY WERE TEENAGERS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE LATE EARLY DEVELOPERS BUT I BELIEVE MY POINT STANDS
ROCKABYE BY CLEAN BANDIT IT'S A REMIX OF ROCKABYE BABY

THAT SOUNDS SO RIDICULOUS I HAD TO FIND IT ON YOUTUBE ADMITTEDLY I ONLY HAD THE PATIENCE TO WATCH ABOUT HALF OF IT BUT WHAT I SAW DIDN'T SOUND ANY THING LIKE THE NURSERY RHYME OR CONTAIN ANY MORE OF THE LYRICS OF THE NURSERY RHYME THAN ROCKABYE BABY UNLESS SOMEONE RAPS THE NURSERY RHYME AT SOME POINT AFTER I STOPPED WATCHING IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS RIDICULOUS AS YOU MAKE IT SOUND


SOMEONE ONCE GOT TO NUMBER ONE WITH A SINGLE THAT SAMPLED THE CASALTY THEME TUNE
WIKI BOUND CASUALTY
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON THE HISTORY OF THE SINGLE IT'S SAD THAT THEY'VE CHANGED THE BUSINESS MODEL TO IT BEING AN UTTER IRRELEVANCE SONGS SEEM TO CHART FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN ACTUAL SALES AS THEY SEEM TO MAKE MORE MONEY FROM LICENSING A TRACK THAN ACTUAL SALES ANYWAY IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY A FEW SECONDS OF A SONG EVER HAS TO SOUND DECENT AS THAT IS ALL PEOPLE WILL HEAR IN AN ADVERT GAME FILM OR TV SHOW

WHAT GETS ME IS HOW MANY SINGLES ARE RELEASED BY BANDS FEATURING OTHER BANDS IN MOST CASES SOMEONE SAMPLING A SONG THAT WAS SAMPLED OFF OF SOMETHING ELSE NOW EARNS A CREDIT ON A RELEASE

ALL OF THOSE SONGS SOUND LIKE THEY WERE WRITTEN SUNG AND PRODUCED BY THE SAME PEOPLE
R LEWRONGGENERATION
TRUST ME ONCE YOU START ACTIVELY AVOIDING THE RADIO THE CHARTS AND POP MUSIC YOUR LIFE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE

I HONESTLY COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW ANY OF THOSE SONGS SOUNDED OR NAME THE ARTIST IF I HEARD IT

OK I LIED I'D PROBABLY BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHICH ONE WAS DAFT PUNK
WHAT ANNOYS ME MORE IS NOT THE TOP TEN ITSELF BUT THE OVERPLAYING OF CERTAIN SONGS UNTIL YOU CAN'T STAND THE SOUND OF IT CURRENTLY IT'S THAT DANCING ON MY OWN SONG WHICH IS INACT A REMAKE OF A SONG THAT WAS OUT NOT THAT LONG AGO ITS DEPRESSING AS FUCK AND IT'S THROWN IN MY FACE EVERY COUPLE OF HOURS IT'S THE SAME WITH ADELE SHE'S SO DEPRESSING AND HER MUSIC WAS CONSTANTLY PLAYED COLDPLAY ARE SO UNIQUE AND THEIR MUSIC GETS PLAYED SO MUCH THAT YOU'RE SICK OF IT RANT OVER
ISN'T THIS THE SORT OF THING THAT USUALLY MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE CHARTS I DON'T THINK BUBBEGUM POP MUSIC IS THE GENRE YOU'D LOOK IN FOR ANYTHING THAT GOES BEYOND THAT SORT OF THING

I'M SORRY I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S SO AWFUL ABOUT THESE SONGS COMPARED TO ANYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THE CHARTS
THE BLOKE SINGING ON CLOSER SHOULD QUIT HIS DAY JOB YEAH IT'S NOT LIKE HE MADE THE SONG OF THE SUMMER AND PROBABLY MILLIONS OFF OF IT

THE CHARTS AREN'T EVEN THAT BAD AT THE MOMENT NO ONES FORCING YOU TO LISTEN TO IT
I'D ACTUALLY GO WITH LITTLE MIX AS THE BEST ON THAT LIST IT'S GOT COLOUR AND ENERGY AND A HUMONGOUS SLATHERING OF SARCASM SIMILAR WITH BRUNO THOUGH IT COMES ACROSS AS A LIGHTER RETREAD OF UPTOWN FUNK WITHOUT MARK HELP

WITH YOU ON MOST OF THE REST WEAK CLEAN BANDIT ESPECIALLY BY THEIR OWN STANDARDS KENDRICK LAMAR SEEMS TO BE SPENDING THIS YEAR TRYING TO UNDO HIS IMAGE BY BEING EVERYWHERE SEXUAL PLAYS THE DECENT CHORUS DISPOSABLE VERSES CARD WHICH IS ALWAYS A SHAME BY THE WAY BY THE WAY YOU DO THINGS TO MY BODY IS ONE OF THE CLUMSIEST LYRICS I'VE HEARD RECENTLY

I DON'T DISLIKE POP MUSIC BUT THIS YEAR'S FELT LIKE A BIT OF A LULL
THERE'S A NEW INTRO

WHY ON EARTH DID THEY REPLACE PERFECTION
POST PERSON PAT AND HIS NON GENDER SPECIFIC DARK AND LIGHT FELINE QUADRATED OTHER SPECIES AVAILABLE YOU MEAN
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE UPDATE WHEN PAT IS FORCED INTO RETIREMENT AS DRONES DELIVER EVERYONE'S HITE AND YODEL TAKES ON THE HEAVY STUFF MUCH TO EVERYONE'S DISMAY
JUST BE GLAD IT WASN'T THE SPECIAL DELIVERY SERVICE THEME
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S MARRIED WITH KIDS IN THE REMAKE RATHER THAN A ROYAL MAIL CONSECRATED CELIBATE
I'VE NOT ENJOYED THEM SINCE THEY CHANGED THE CHOCOLATE THEY TASTE AWFUL NOW
AVOID CREME EGGS HAVE NEVER HAD A BEST BEFORE DATE ON THEM THAT'S WHY THEY WERE ONLY THERE FOR HALF THE YEAR SO THEY COULD DISTINGUISH STOCK FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT UNLESS NOW OBVIOUSLY THE AMERICANS HAVE DECIDED TO SPOIL ANOTHER UK TRADITION
YOU'RE TOO SURPRISED TO BUY ONE THAT'S A SOLID CASE OF DFS SALE SYNDROME IF I'VE EVER HEARD ONE
THAT'S BECAUSE NO ONE ATE THEM AT EASTER BECAUSE MONDELEZ MADE THEM HITE

THE CRIME EGG MOUNTAIN MUST BE HUGE
NOT HAD ONE SINCE THEY CHANGED THE CHOCOLATE IT MAKES ME SAD I LOVED THEM BUT DAIRY MILK IS JUST THE BEST I DON'T EAT ANYTHING ELSE WHEN IT COMES TO CHOCOLATE
I WAS ONCE AT A PRODIGY GIG AND I NEEDED A HITE

I GO TO THE TOILET AND FIND A CUBICLE AS I'M ABOUT TO CLOSE THE DOOR SOME PISSED GUY DECIDES IT WOULD BET THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION WITH ME

I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT HE WAS WANTING TO TALK ABOUT BUT BEING MY POLITE MYSELF I'M NODDING AND AGREEING WHILE DESPERATELY TRYING TO KEEP THE TURTLE FROM LEAVING HIS SHELL I SPOT A GAP IN THE CONVERSATION AND LET OUT A COOL HAHA YEAH BEFORE CLOSING THE DOOR AND DROPPING MY BREEKS NOT BEFORE A VIGOROUS SCRUB OF THE SEAT I HASTEN TO ADD

UPON ME CLOSING THE DOOR SO I CAN SHIT IN PRIVACY THE PISSED GUY TAKES MAJOR OFFENCE THAT I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO AND LET HIM WATCH ME TAKE A DUMP AND STARTS SHOUTING THAT WANKER CLOSED THE DOOR ON ME HE'S CLOSED THE DOOR TO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WANTING TO TAKE A PISH IN PEACE

GAVE IT AN EXTRA FIVE MINUTES AFTER I WAS DONE TO LEAVE THE CUBICLE DON'T NEED THAT AGGRO
PISSING ALL OVER HIS SHOES AND CHATTING FOOTBALL POLITICS WHILST SWAYING AROUND LIKE HE'S ON A CROSS CHANNEL FERRY DID HE CARRY ON CHATTING TO YOU AS YOU LEFT
TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE MUCH LIKE SOMEONE USING THE MIDDLE OF URINALS WHEN AN END ONE IS AVAILABLE
I CONSIDER PEOPLE WHO WORK AT PRIMARK DESERVE THE SAME RESPECT AS NURSES JUNIOR DOCTORS CARERS

HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THOSE HORRIBLE CUSTOMERS THAT TRASH THE DISPLAYS
I WAS ONLY JUST GIVEN THE DUMB I HEART PRIMARK SHIRT AND FLEECE WHAT'S THIS ABOUT CHRISTMAS JUMPERS
WELL THAT'S NEW I HAVEN'T WORKED AT PRIMARK FOR ABOUT YEARS NOW BUT WHEN I DID A CHRISTMAS JUMPER WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED FAR TOO MUCH LIKE FUN TO BE ACCEPTABLE
WHAT IS WRONG WITH A CHRISTMAS JUMPER UNIFORM DO YOU NOT LIKE GETTING INTO THE CHRISTMAS SPIRT

PERSONALLY HAVING WORKED AT DIFFERENT COMPANIES IN THE PAST THAT REQUIRED CHRISTMAS JUMPER AS PART OF UNIFORM IT WAS GOOD FUN AND BECAME MORE ENGAGING WITH CUSTOMERS
IF THAT'S THE WORST THING YOU'VE SEEN IN ASDA THEN COUNT YOURSELF LUCKY SOURCE FORMER EMPLOYEE
MAYBE SHE IS AT THAT I COULDN'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK STAGE
I SAW SOMEONE POSSIBLY DEAD IN
ASDA

THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM ASDA IS OWNED BY WALMART AND UNSURPRISINGLY ATTRACTS A SIMILAR DEMOGRAPHY TO THOSE WHO CAN BE FOUND IN R PEOPLEOFWALMART
HAMM SHE'S EITHER DESPERATELY SEEKING ATTENTION OR SHE SERIOUSLY NEEDS ATTENTION
WAS SHE WONDERING ANYONE WOULD NOTICE
MAYBE SHE WAS TRYING TO STEAL A BRIGHT PINK DRESSING GOWN
IT'S UTTERLY BIZARRE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE THINK IT'S SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO WANDER AROUND IN PUBLIC WITH NO CLOTHES OTHER THAN THEIR PAJAMAS IF YOU DON'T OWN OR RENT THE PROPERTY YOU'RE CURRENTLY ON PUT SOME DAMN CLOTHES ON IT'S OKAY TO WANDER AROUND YOUR GARDEN COLLECT THE MILK IF YOU GET IT DELIVERED OR QUICKLY WATER THE PLANTS IN YOUR DRESSING GOWN BUT IT'S NOT OKAY TO DROP YOUR KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL GO TO THE SHOPS OR WALK THE DOG IN YOUR BLOODY PAJAMAS

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MENTALITY HAS SOMEHOW FLOURISHED IN OUR OTHERWISE RELATIVELY CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY
MAYBE SHE WAS ON THE WAY TO THE PHARMACY OR MEDICINES AISLE TO CONSIDERATELY SAVE THE NHS A VISIT BY GOING FOR THE WALK IN OPTION
COMPLAIN ABOUT IT ARRIVING ON TIME AND IN PERFECT CONDITION LEAVING YOU WITH NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT
THIS HAPPENED TO ME A FEW WEEKS AGO FIRST PACKAGE I'VE EVER HAD DELIVERED BY THEM AND WAS EXPECTING THE WORST ARRIVED EXACTLY WHEN THEY SAID IT WOULD AND THE DRIVER WAS REALLY FRIENDLY BAFFLING
AS I HAVE JUST ORDERED MYSELF A NEW TV THAT HAS YET TO BE DELIVERED IN MY GREAT IMPATIENCE FOR IT TO ARRIVE I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY I HAVE COMPLAINED ENOUGH FOR TWO PEOPLE SO IT KIND OF BALANCES OUT
DON'T WORRY THEY ARE STILL WORKING HARD AT BEING USELESS I LEFT A PLASTIC BOX OUT DUE TO THE RECENT REALLY BAD WEATHER AND THAT I WAS AWAY FOR A FEW DAYS AND KNEW A PACKAGE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE A WEEK AGO HADN'T

THE BOX WAS LEFT ON THE PATH LEADING TO THE BACK OF MY HOUSE RIGHT BEHIND THE BACK GATE YODEL DECIDED IT WAS BEST TO LEAVE THE PACKAGE ON THE PATH LESS THAN FROM THE BOX THAT WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THE PACKAGE FROM THE TORRENTIAL RAIN
YODEL DELIVERED ONE OF MY PACKAGES THE OTHER DAY BUT THE DRIVER DIDN'T PUT A SLIP THROUGH THE DOOR TO LET ME KNOW

PROBLEM WAS HE PUT IT IN THE RECYCLING BIN AND I ONLY FOUND OUT WHEN THE DUSTMAN KNOCKED ON MY DOOR TO HAND ME THE PACKAGE

THANKS YODEL I GUESS
R BRITISHSUCCESS
R BRITISHPROBLEMSUCCESS
COMPLAIN THAT IT ISN'T THE STANDARD
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT IT'S YOUR PARCEL

I SUSPECT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY JUST A STAGGERING COINCIDENCE SOMEBODY ELSE ORDERED THE SAME THING BUT YODEL MANAGED TO SWAP THE LABELS DELIVERING YOUR PACKAGE TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND THEIRS TO YOU

THIS HAS THE RESULT THAT YOU BOTH ENDED UP WITH THE PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU ORDERED WHILST AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING YODEL TO ADHERE TO THEIR POLICY OF BEING UTTERLY WANK
IF YOU ARE A TRUE BRITISH YOU'LL FIND SOMETHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT BY THE TIME YOU'VE FINISHED YOUR NEXT CUP OF TEA GET KETTLE ON LAD
MINE TOO I EVEN SUCCESSFULLY GOT A PARCEL FROM THE ROYAL MAIL AS WELL WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THE DEPOT LIKE I DID WITH POKEMON MOON NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY
I DON'T GET WHY WE DON'T JUST DO IT HOW THE AMERICANS DO IT DON'T EVEN NEED TO SPEAK TO THE POSTMAN HOW DID THE AMERICANS GET TO THAT BEFORE US
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE OTHER DELIVERY THEY PUT IN YOUR WHEELIE BIN WHICH YOU HAVEN'T FOUND OUT ABOUT YET
USED TO WORK FOR A LITTLE BOOKSHOP AND OUR SUPPLIER USED YODEL FOR DELIVERIES NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH THEM AND IT WAS ALWAYS THIS SUPER NICE DUDE WHO DROPPED THEM OFF AND WE'D HAVE A BRIEF CHAT WHENEVER I SAW THEM BUT UH YEAH THEY REALLY SUCK
AS A PARENT I WOULD NEVER SIT WITH MY CHILD IN THE QUIET COACH IT'S JUST GOING TO RESULT IN MY CHILD NOT BEING QUIET AND ME WANTING THE GROUND TO SWALLOW ME UP
TELL HER IT'S A TRAIN NOT A BUS PARENTS THESE DAYS
I HAD THE JOYS OF DISCOVERING A NEW NURSERY RHYME THE OTHER DAY THAT OF THE DINGLE DANGLE SCARECROW UNFORTUNATELY I DISCOVERED THIS ON THE FROM HAYES FROM A YEAR OLD GIRL WHO DECIDED I STILL HADN'T LEARNED IT PROPERLY UNTIL WHEN WE ARRIVED AT CHARING CROSS MINUTES OF THE DINGLE DANGLE SCARECROW FORTY EIGHT
UNVOTING FOR THE USE OF THE WORD TOAD
IT'S ALWAYS QUIET IN FIRST CLASSICAL
THAT'S SOME GENEVA CONVENTION BULLSHIT CRUEL UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT
I HEAR IT'S ONLY MANSLAUGHTER IF YOU COMMIT DOUBLE HOMICIDE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES YEAR MAXIMUM SENTENCE MIGHT BE WORTH IT
WORST TIME IN THE QUIET COACH FOR ME WAS WHEN A GAGGLE OF VERY LOUD MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN WHO'D NEVER HEARD OF THE CONCEPT OF AN INDOOR VOICE GOT ON AND PISSED EVERYONE OFFICIAL WHEN PEOPLE REMINDED THEM IT WAS THE QUIET CARRIAGE THEY WERE REALLY OBNOXIOUS

WHEN THEY FINALLY GOT OFF THE TRAIN THERE WAS A BIT OF NOISE IN THE CARRIAGE WE ALL APPLAUDED BECAUSE THEY WERE LEAVING
COULD BE WORSE COULD BE THE ALPHABET SONG WITH THE LITTLE UN REPEATEDLY ENDING IT WITH EX WYE ZEE
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE QUIET COACH WHEN IT EXISTS WAS NO PHONE CALLS NOT DON'T EVEN LET ME HEAR YOU BREATHE
WHY DID THEY SEND YOU A LETTER
HOW DID A LETTER WAKE YOU UP
DELETED
I THINK YOUR REAL PROBLEM IS THAT YOU WATCH X FACTOR
MY DAD SAYS THIS LITERALLY EVERY TIME HE SEES HER ON THE TELLY
HER SURNAME IS GILFORD I CAN ONLY PRESUME IT'S COS OF THAT
WIT THE FUCK IS A WIFI KETTLE
MAYBE I LIKE THE MISERY
I BOUGHT A CAST IRON KETTLE TO GO ON MY LOG BURNER I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A WHISTLE I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
WE PLUGGED THE KETTLE INTO A DEMO PLUG SO WE CAN TELL THE AMAZON ECHO ALEXA TURN ON KETTLE
IF MY KETTLE AUTOMATICALLY TURNED ON WITH MY FIRST SNOOZE OF THE ALARM I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING
JUST GO WITH YOUR AFFRONTER YOUR INSTINCTS ARE CORRECT EVEN THOUGH I GRUDGINGLY USE THEM NOW ELECTRIC KETTLES GENERALLY MAKE ME UNEASY I LIKE SOMETHING METAL THAT YOU CAN POP ON THE GAS WITH A CURVY SPOUT OPTIONAL DON'T MIND A WHISTLER
RELEVANT
HAVE YOU CHECKED WHO ELSE IS ABOARD THE TRAIN PERHAPS THERE'S AN EXECUTIVE FOR A REGIONAL RADIO STATION AND HE'S DOING AN IMPROMPTU AUDITION
THE WORST IS WHEN THEY ANNOUNCE EVERY SINGLE THING THE BUFFET SELLS

AT EVERY STATION
BETTER HEADPHONES

I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING ELSE WHEN I HAVE MY HEADPHONES IN BEST PART IS I'M ALSO NOT FORCING ANYONE ELSE TO HEAR MY MUSIC EITHER THEY ONLY COST ABOUT FOR A DECENT PAIR THAT DO THIS NOT LIKE THOSE PORTABLE MEGAPHONES BY DRE THAT SEEM TO BE MADE BACKWARDS SO THAT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN'T HEAR THE MUSIC IS THE WEARER
AT MY STATION

RECORDED ANNOUNCEMENT THE NEXT TRAIN TO ARRIVE AT PLATFORM WHATEVER WILL BE THE WHENEVER TO WHEREVER

IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY ANNOUNCEMENT FROM A MAN IN A BOX

THE NEXT TRAIN TO ARRIVE AT PLATFORM WHATEVER WILL BE THE WHENEVER TO WHEREVER PASSENGERS FOR WHEREVER PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY TO PLATFORM WHATEVER
DELETED
DEPENDS IF IT'S COMING OUT OF A POT MILK IN FIRST BUT PEOPLE WHO PUT IT IN FIRST WITH A SEABAG IN THE CUP SHOULD BE DISPATCHED WITH A SINGLE SHOT TO THE TEMPLE

EDIT BIT HARSH MAYBE GIVEN A CHINESE BURN

EDIT EDIT ARE YOU STILL ALLOWED TO SAY CHINESE BURN
AND NOR SHOULD YOU HAVE TO OP IT IS NOT A THING THAT SHOULD BE NORMALISED
SUGAR AND CREAM FIRST BECAUSE MAN IT SUCKS TO OVER FILL AND HAVE TO DUMP LIQUID OUT AND MESS UP SWEETNESS BALANCE BECAUSE TEA COFFEE ISN'T WHITE ENOUGH

BUT THEN I DO IDENTIFY AS A BARBARIAN SO THERE IS THAT
I ALWAYS PUT THE MILK IN FIRST WHEN MAKING TEA OR COFFEE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MY IRISH MUM TAUGHT ME TO WHEN I WAS A KID
I ALWAYS PUT THE BAG AND SUGAR IN FIRST DANGLE THE STRING ON THE EDGE OF THE CUP AND THEN POUR THE HOT MILK IN

THEN AGAIN I DON'T DRINK HEATHEN TYPHON PG TETLEY ETC TEA IF IT'S NOT TWINING OR SOME OTHER SPECIALITY TEA IT'S YORKSHIRE

THE FLIP SIDE IS I DON'T REALLY DRINK TEA VERY MUCH I HAVE AN ESPRESSO PUMP SO I'M MORE LIKELY TO BE DOING MYSELF AN AMERICANO OR A LATTE THAN A TEA I'M TOLD MY CHAI LATHES ARE INCREDIBLE THOUGH
SHOULD SEE HOW AMERICANS MAKE TEA THEY ACTUALLY PUT IT IN COLD SALTY WATER AT NOWHERE NEAR THE RIGHT RATIO AND THEN DON'T BOTHER DRINKING IT OR STRAINING THE LEAF OUT
IT WOULD JUST BE FOLLOWED BY OTHER SPY FICTION IS AVAILABLE
I DON'T GET THE REFERENCE
NO THE WEST INDIES IS OVER HERE THAT IS THE EAST INDIES
EMERGENCY DENTIST

LAZY BASTARD A WHOLE MONTH OFFICIAL
YOU HAVE A DENTIST
TECHNOLOGY IS GETTING TOO ADVANCED WILL SMITH HAS WARNED US ABOUT THIS WITH THE FILM ROBOT WE SHOULD PROBABLY LISTEN TO HIM
I THINK I'LL GET AN ECHO VERY FUTURISTIC I THINK THE ACTUAL PROBLEM WILL BE WHAT TO DO AFTER PLAYING A FEW SONGS AND ADDING LOO ROLL TO MY SHOPPING LIST
I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT SOMETHING IN THEIR LIVING ROOM THAT LISTENS TO EVERY SINGLE THING YOU SAY THIS IS HOW DYSTOPIAS START
SAW ONE IN CURRYS I ASKED IT A QUESTION IT COMPLETELY IGNORED ME

BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE LITTLE BRITAIN WILL NEVER BE MADE AGAIN
HOLY STRAWMAN ABCS A PROGRAMME THAT NOBODY IS PLANNING TO REMAKE PROBABLY WON'T BE REMADE BECAUSE I'VE MADE UP SOME PEOPLE OBJECTING TO IT FOR REASONS I'VE ALSO MADE UP
THE WELSH GET THE BLAME FOR EVERYTHING AND RIGHTLY SO
WHAT VOCAL MINORITY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
LITTLE BRITAIN NEVER BEING MADE AGAIN IS NOT A PROBLEM

DAVID WILLIAMS SAID RECENTLY HE SHOULD GIVE UP COMEDY FOR WRITING CHILDREN'S BOOKS HE'S RIGHT JUST AS LONG HE GIVES UP COMEDY
OR BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER VERY FUNNY
HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK NOT BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT IS THE CURRENT NATIONAL SPORT BUT WHEN LITTLE BRITAIN CAME OUT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS WAS VERY MUCH IN
OR BECAUSE IT WOULD NOW BE CLASSIFIED AS A DOCUMENTARY
FIDEL CASTRO THIS TIME SAVED YOU A CLICK
STEPHEN HAWKING

I KEEP EXPECTING TO HEAR HE'S BEEN KILLED IN A POLICE CHASE AFTER A SHOP IN HIS WHEELCHAIR OR SOMETHING
THE BBC NEWS SITE HAS TURNED INTO A MAGAZINE THESE DAYS
THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE TO NEWS THESE DAYS EXCEPT WAR AND PEOPLE DYING
I STOPPED DOING THAT WHEN THE ANSWER WAS PRINCE
SHEPARD BOOK FROM FIREFLY DIED
FUNNY THING WAS ON TWITTER EARLIER AND THE WRITER JOSH WEEDON TWEETED AN OBITUARY TO SOMEONE CALLED RON I THOUGHT WHO'S DIED NOW
I MADE THE MISTAKE OF SETTING THE WICKET ALERTS ON THE BBC SPORT APP FORGETTING THAT INDIA IS IN A DIFFERENT TIME ZONE

A CLASSIC ENGLAND BATTING COLLAPSE IS ANNOYING AT THE BEST OF TIMES BUT PARTICULARLY SO WHEN IT WAKES YOU UP AT AM
YOUR OWN FAULT FOR BEING SO SLOW OBVIOUSLY
MAYBE THERE IS SOME CODE PHRASE YOU COULD USE LIKE

COULD YOU POP A FRESH ONE IN THE FRYER FOR ME PLEASE
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BLAND AND LIFELESS IT'S PART OF THE DISH IT'S A REFLECTION ON LIFE IN BRITAIN THE SOGGINESS OF THE BATTER IS A COMMENTARY ON THE WEATHER
FOR ADDED EFFECT THE CHIPS SHOULD BE UNDERDONE AND LIFELESS TO SYMBOLISE THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE SINCE BREVIT

IF YOU FINISH A CHIPPY TEA WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE YOU'VE GONE TO THE WRONG CHIPPY
ALWAYS TRY TO THINK ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS TRANSLATED TO OTHER SITUATIONS THINK OF THOSE SHITTY FUCKING CRANE GRABBER MACHINES IN ARCADES YOU COULD BANG A QUID IN AND HOPE FOR THE BEST OR YOU COULD BE A CUNT WAIT FOR SOME UNSUSPECTING YEAR OLD PRICK TO PILE IN OR OF DADDIES POUNDS AND NOT GET A SAUSAGE OUT NOW YOU STRIKE

TL R WAIT FOR SOME OTHER CUNT TO BUY THE OLD FISH
ORDER HADDOCK MY LOCAL CHIP SHOPS NEVER HAVE HADDOCK SITTING AROUND ONLY COD THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO COOK IT FRESH
SIT OUTSIDE THE CHIPPIE FOR HALF AN HOUR WITH A PAIR OF BINOCULARS TRAINED ON THE HOT BOX IF QUESTIONED BY THE CONSTABULARY JUST TELL THEM THAT YOU FEEL YOU CAN'T TRUST YOUR CHIP PROPRIETOR SO YOU'RE TIMING HIS COD
ALL THE CHIPPIES ROUND HERE ONLY COOK FISH TO ORDER
I WORKED IN A FISH AND CHIP SHOP FOR A WHILE FROM MEMORY THEY RARELY LEFT FISH OUT UNDER THE LIGHTS ON A QUIET NIGHT AND SIMPLY APOLOGISED THAT THE CUSTOMER WOULD NEED TO WAIT MINS UNTIL IT WAS COOKED WHEN SOMEONE CAME IN MOST CUSTOMERS WERE FINE A COUPLE GOT SHIRTY AND COMPLAINED BUT THE BOSS SAID IT WAS BETTER FOR THEM TO GET FRESH COOKED RATHER THAN FISH THAT HAD BEEN SAT THERE FOR MINS IT ALSO SAVED MONEY SINCE OFTEN LEFT OVER FISH HAS TO BE THROWN OUT AFTER IT'S SAT THERE FOR A WHILE

PERSONALLY IF POSSIBLE I'D FIND A NEW CHIPPY TO USE AND I'D TELL THEM WHY TOO BUT I'M GETTING LESS ENGLISH THE MORE I STAY IN FRANCE I'VE NOTICED
I FEEL THIS ISN'T A BRITISH PROBLEM BUT A MIDDLE CLASS PROBLEM

IT'S A TAKEAWAY THEY KEEP FOOD WARM IF IT'S GETTING COLD THAT MEANS THEIR HEATER ISN'T RIGHT IF IT'S STALE AFTER MINUTES THAT MEANS YOUR TASTE BUDS ARE A BIT PRECIOUS

SOME STUFF DEFINITELY IMPROVES WITH A DELAY ANYWAY I'LL FIGHT ANYONE WHO SAYS CHIPS FROM A CHIP SHOP ARE BEST FRESH THEY ARE TOO HOT AND MUCH BETTER AFTER SITTING AND DEVELOPING SOME GREASE FOR MINUTES
I JUST GO TO THE ONE WHO COOKS FRESH MATE AND OUT OF THOSE THE ONE WITH THE FIT CHIPPY GIRL THE ONE I'D LIKE TO GIVE HER A PORTION

HADDOCK CHIPS CURRY SAUCE PICKLED EGG THEN I WAIT PATIENTLY MAKING SMALLTALK WHILST WAITING

UNLESS I'M HUNG OVER THEN THE DISGUSTING AS FUCK CHINESE ONE WILL DO FOR COD AND CHIPS ITS SO FUCKING DISGUSTING AND I'M NOT SURE ITS ACTUALLY FISH BUT ITS DOWN THE END OF THE ROAD

AT THAT ONE I GO FOR THE SAUSAGE WHICH IS MADE OF EARS LIPS AND ARSEHOLE USUALLY
HOW ATTACHED TO BATTER ARE YOU IF YOU ASK FOR A LIGHT BATTERED FISH AROUND HERE THEY COOK IT FRESH FOR YOU
CHANGE YOUR CHIPPY THE GOOD ONES ONLY COOK TO ORDER USUALLY FIRST THING THEY ASK AS YOU POP YOUR HEAD IN THE DOOR ANY FISH LOVE AYE TWO COD PLEASE BY THE TIME YOU GET TO ORDER THE CHIPS ETC YOUR FISH IS READY
IF YOU ASK FOR A LIGHTLY DONE THEY NORMALLY PUT A FRESH ONE IN
ASK FOR ONE TO BE PUT IN AS YOU ENTER OR ASK FOR A LARGE FISH AS THEY ARE NORMALLY COOKED TO ORDER
ASK FOR LIGHTLY BATTERED IF YOU DON'T MIND IT AND IT'S DONE NO ASKED ROUND MY PARTS
ASK FOR YOUR FISH SKINNED
GET A BETTER CHIPPY MY LOCAL CHIPPY AND I MEAN LOCAL ITS ABOUT YARDS AWAY WONT SELL YOU FISH THATS BEEN THERE ANY LONGER THAN ABOUT MINUTES AND HE WILL BATTER AND FRY IT FRESH FOR YOU HIS FISH NEVER TASTES STALE AND THE KEBABS FROM THERE ARE AMAZING THE ONLY PROBLEM IS HE IS TOO GOOD THERE'S NEARLY ALWAYS A HUGE QUEUE
I GET AROUND THIS BY ORDERING A MUSHY PEA FRITTER THE TRICK IS TO LIKE MUSHY PEA FRITTERS
I USED TO WORK IN A CHIPPY AND WE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM IF SOME ASKED FOR A FRESH ONE THAT SAID NOTHING EVER SAT THERE FOR LONGER THAN AN HOUR AND THIS WAS IN A SMALL TOWN
ASK FOR A SPECIAL FISH THATS WHAT IT IS CALLED WHERE I LIVE IT IS JUST THE SAME BUT IN BREAD-CRUMB INSTEAD OF BATTER AND ALWAYS COOKED FROM SCRATCH BECAUSE ITS NOT THE POPULAR CHOICE

I KNOW U MAY PREFER THE BATTERED FISH BUT GIVE IT A GO BUT ITS ABOUT DEARER TOO
THE CHIPPIE NEAREST ME IS A VERY GOOD ONE WON A LOAD OF AWARDS OVER THE YEARS BUT EVEN THEY KIND OF HAVE THIS PROBLEM TO SOME EXTENT NORMALLY I ORDER FROM THE SPECIALS BOARD AS THEY HAVE TO COOK THAT FRESH EACH TIME
MY LOCAL ONLY LEAVES FISH UNDER THE HEATER ON FRIDAY AND IT DOESN'T SIT FOR LONG
ORDER PLAICE INSTEAD OF COD SEEMS TO DO THE TRICK FOR ME
EVERY CHIPPY I'VE BEEN IN HAVE ONLY COOKED FISH TO ORDER IF THERE'S A QUEUE YOU SHOUT OUT HOW MANY FISH YOU WANT AS YOU ENTER THEN IT'S USUALLY DONE BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE COUNTER
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY COD IN FISH AND CHIP SHOPS USE WHITE FISH OTHER THAN COD THE CHEEK OF IT PLUS IT'S SERIOUS FRAUD
I ONLY GET IF I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE FISH
IF IT'S LATE BY MINUTES KEEP BADGERING THEM UNTIL THEY PAY YOU BACK DID YOU STATE THAT YOU ARRIVED MINUTES LATE ON THE FORM
IT DOESNT COUNT AS DELAYED UNTALL ITS MINUTES LATE SO THATS HOW THEYVE FIGURED THAT ITS UTTER RUBBISH THOUGH
PHONE CUSTOMER SERVICES AND HAVE A MOAN ABOUT THAT TELL THEM YOU WAITED IN AND MAKE UP SOME GUFF STRESS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS YOU RECEIVE IT TODAY
I ORDERED SOMETHING FROM AMAZON AND LEFT A NOTE ON THE DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS SAYING DO NOT LEAVE WITH ANY NEIGHBOURS I AM HARD OF HEARING KNOCK HARD I AM HOME THEY LEFT MY DAD'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT AT THE HOUSE OF THAT FAMILY DIDN'T KNOCK ON THE DOOR ONCE I WAS IN ALL DAY AND I'M NOT HARD OF HEARING IT BOILS MY PISS
MAIL MAN GENTLEMEN WE APPEAR TO HAVE AN IMPOSTER
NOW I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT TO FILL MY DAY WITH

CUTTING UP AND DISPOSING OF HIS BODY
LAST WEEK MY POSTIE PUT A SLIP THROUGH THE DOOR SAYING IN BLUE BIN

NOW THIS IS FINE NORMALLY THE PARCEL IS IN MY BLUE RECYCLING BIN BY THE BACK DOOR HOWEVER ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY THE BLUE BIN WAS ON THE PAVEMENT BY ALL THE OTHER BLUE BINS WAITING TO BE EMPTIED

AND SO MY PARCEL MANAGED TO RECYCLE ITSELF BEFORE I'D EVEN SEEN IT

HE ALSO QUITE OFTEN SIGNS FOR THINGS ON MY BEHALF AND PUTS SIGNED FOR BY POSTIE SMILEY FACE DRAWING I DON'T MIND BECAUSE IT SAVES ME HAVING TO GO TO THE OFFICE TO SIGN FOR IT MYSELF BUT AT THE SAME TIME I ALWAYS FEEL A BIT LIKE WTF IS THE POINT OF HAVING SOMETHING SENT SIGNED FOR IF THEY'RE GONNA JUST FORGE MY SIGNATURE
I GOT BACK FROM THE PUB LAST NIGHT AND FOUND AN EMPTY ENVELOPE WITH A HOLE IN IT INSIDE A ROYAL MAIL PLASTIC BAG WITH A SORRY YOUR POST HAS ARRIVED IN THIS CONDITION MESSAGE PRINTED ON IT IT'S THE MOST APPALLING THING I'VE EVER SEEN

I'M GOING TO GO TO THE POST OFFICE AFTER WORK AND ASK THEM HOW THEY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE THE TEMERITY TO DELIVER ME SUCH A THING
ID MAKE A POINT OF IT AND GET HIS NAME AND COMPLAIN HES PAID TO DELIVER THE FUCKING MAIL
I ONCE WATCHED A ROYAL MAIL GUY PULL UP IN HIS VAN FILL OUT THE RED SLIP FROM HIS SEAT THEN WALK TO MY DOOR TO POST IT BECAUSE IT WAS RAINING AND HE COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO RING THE DOORBELL AND WAIT A FEW SECONDS

I'VE ALSO HAD A PAYSLIP THAT USED TO GET POSTED TO US THEY'RE NOW EMAILED THAT CONTAINED ALL MY SALARY INFORMATION LEFT ON MY PATH BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T PUT IT THROUGH THE SLOT FULLY

FRIEND OF MINE U MOSHIZZ HAD ONE YEARS AGO ALONG THE LINES OF COULD NOT ACCESS PROPERTY OR COULD NOT OPEN GATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY LITERALLY HAD TO OPEN THE GATE AND ACCESS THE PROPERTY TO POST THAT SLIP THROUGH
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER IF WE COULD JUST OPT TO COLLECT THINGS AT THE POST OFFICE THIS WHOLE THING IS RETARDED
PHONE THEM UP AND COMPLAIN THAT THEY SHOULD BE PRIVATIZED AND THAT AMAZON DONT PULL THAT SHIT
SOAKED HIM WITH A BUCKET OF WATER

IF HE COMPLAINS WELL IT WASN'T YOU BECAUSE APPARENTLY YOU WEREN'T IN
WATCH V AWB

HAD A GUY DO A DELIVERY YESTERDAY INSISTED MY NEIGHBOUR TOOK THE PACKAGE THEN KNOCKED ON MY DOOR TO TELL ME IT WAS THERE
PLEASE MAKE AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT
HAD ONE OF THOSE 2 DAYS AGO AFTER I HAD JUST COME BACK FROM SHOPPING POSTIE WAS STILL ON THE ROAD BEFORE I ENTERED MY HOUSE I RAN BACK OUT TO SEE IF I COULD GET HIM TO GIVE ME THE PACKAGE BUT THE BLOODY GUY DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR
THERE IS NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING ORDERED SOME NEW BUSINESS CARDS FOR MY TRIP ABROAD AND I TOOK A DAY OFF WORK ONLY TO RECEIVE AN EMAIL LATER IN THE DAY SAYING WE TRIED TO DELIVER BUT YOU WEREN'T IN FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER SAYING I HAD FOR THE FOLLOWING MONDAY A DAY AFTER I FLEW USELESS

THEY LITERALLY HAVE ONE JOB TO DELIVER PARCELS IT'S A GOOD JOB THEY DON'T DELIVER BLOOD OR ORGANS FOR LIFE SAVING PURPOSES
NEVER MIND THE POLICE POSTMEN SHOULD BE MADE TO WEAR BODYCAMS
CHECKY BASTARD
FUCKING REPORT HIM
I WAS DENIED RECEIVING A PARCEL FROM DPW FOR MY PARTNER BECAUSE MY NATIONAL IDENTITY CARD DIDN'T FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF BEING A PASSPORT OR A DRIVERS LICENSE IT'S OK FOR ME TO USE IT TO FLY ABROAD BUT NOT TO RECEIVE A PARCEL IN MY OWN HOME

APPARENTLY HE WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO ASK ME FOR A BILL WITH MY NAME ON IT BUT HE NEVER DID

NEVER FELT SO DISCRIMINATED IN MY LIFE
WAIT YOU TOOK A DAY OFF WORK FOR SOME MAIL
CHRIST THAT IS WEIRD THE SAME JUST HAPPENED TO ME
PRACTICE YOUR SAD FACE AND CALL THE DAILY MAIL
THE COMPLAINING GO PLEASE UPDATE US
HAD THEM PUT JEWELLERY IN THE RECYCLING BIN WHICH WAS EMPTIED THAT DAY

ONE KEPT FOLDING EVERYTHING IN HALF INCLUDING THINGS THAT SAID DO NOT BEND A CERTIFICATE ENDED UP MESSED UP SO I WAS PISSED OFF AND DECIDED TO SAY SOMETHING THE NEXT TIME SHE CAME CUE ME STOOD ON MY DOORSTEP GESTURING AT MY LETTER BOX SAYING IS IT NOT OF ADEQUATE SIZE
HE DIDN'T BRING IT AS HE DIDN'T THINK I WOULD BE IN

I TOOK A DAY OFF FOR THIS

CHARGE THEM FOR A DAY OFF WORK HOWEVER MUCH YOU EARN PER DAY PLUS YOUR TRAVEL COSTS TO THE SORTING OFFICE PLUS ADMIN CHARGES

SERIOUSLY DO IT
SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS
I'M SORRY MAN I KNOW THE FEELING
SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENED TO MUM ONCE ONLY SHE WAS TOLD IT WAS TOO BIG TO FIT IN THE BASKET SHE WAS UNIMPRESSED
I HAD AN EMAIL CLAIMING THAT ROYAL MAIL TRIED TO DELIVER A PARCEL YET THERE WAS NO CARD IN THE DOOR
SO THAT'S WHY THEY DO IT I FIGURED THEY COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO KNOCK AND WAIT OR THE TIME PRESSURES DON'T ALLOW IT
THE ANSWER TO THEIR EXCUSE IS WELL YOU HAD BETTER GO BACK AND GET IT
NOT SO MANY HAPPY NOW HUH
WOW I DIDN'T KNOW POSTMEN ACTUALLY LEFT PARCELS THINKING PEOPLE WON'T BE IN WHAT A FUCKING STUPID THING TO ASSUME WHY NOT JUST BRING IT ANYWAY DOES IT TAKE UP THAT MUCH ROOM
ORDER IT TO WORK SOMEONE'S ALWAYS IN AT WORK
MAKES ME FEEL BLESSED TO HAVE SUCH A KIND CONSIDERATE AND FRIENDLY POSTMAN

ALTHOUGH HE'S GETTING ON IN YEARS WILL LIKELY RETIRE SOMETIME SOON

HOPEFULLY HIS REPLACEMENT ISN'T ONE OF THE POSTMEN FROM HELL I AM SEEING IN THIS THREAD

FOOTNOTE ANECDOTE MY FATHER ONCE ORDERED A DICTIONARY SET FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENT IT NEVER ARRIVED SO HE HAD TO IT A YEAR LATER HE WAS IN OUR ALLEYWAY AND HE FOUND A SOGGY RAGGED MESS OF A PARCEL IT WAS THE DICTIONARY SET AFTER HE SAW WE WEREN'T IN THE COURIER HAD DECIDED THAT THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO SLING THE PARCEL OVER OUR GATE AND WALK OFFICIAL WANKER
FUCKING BASTARD HOW THE HELL DID HE KNOW YOU WEREN'T GOING TO BE IN

I HOPE TO HELL HE WENT AND GOT IT FOR YOU
IF THIS GENUINELY HAPPENED THEN THE POSTMAN IS SHIT FOR NOT DOING THEIR JOB

I WORK FOR RM AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PASTIES THAT DELIVER LIKE THE ONE YOU MENTIONED I'D BE IN DEEP SHIT IF I LEFT A PARCEL AT THE DEPOT
GIT
POST DANMARK NOW POSTNORD HERE IN DENMARK DID THE EXACT SAME THING THERE WAS A FEATURE ON A WATCHDOGS STYLE PROGRAM MONTANT I THINK ITS CALLED THAT HIGHLIGHTED IT I THINK IT FORCED POST DANMARK TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY DID THINGS
I PLACED AN ORDER IN FULL EXPECTATION THAT I WOULDN'T BE HOME BUT THAT OBE PARCEL WOULD BE DELIVERED TO THE SORTING OFFICE MIN WALK DOWN THE ROAD I HAVE TO GO AND PICK MY PARCEL UP FROM THE TINY VILLAGE POST OFFICE DRIVE AWAY
I ONCE STAYED IN FOR A PACKAGE AND SAW A LETTER COME THROUGH THE DOOR BUT NO YOU WERE AWAY SLIP OR ANYTHING I WENT OUTSIDE TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD MY PACKAGE AND I COULD SEE ONE STICKING OUT OF HIS BAG THAT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE I WAS EXPECTING HE SAID I DON'T THINK SO SO I SAID CAN YOU CHECK

SURE ENOUGH IT'S MY PACKAGE
I DONT MIND WHEN I'M ACTUALLY OUT OF COURSE AN A4 BOOK IN CARDBOARD PACKAGING IS NOT GONG TO FIT THROUGH THE LETTER BOX MY MAIN ISSUE IS ROYAL MAIL HAS MOVED MY LOCAL COLLECTION POINT TO SOMEWHERE BASICALLY INACCESSIBLE BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT I DON'T HAVE A CAR
LITERALLY THIS EXACT THING HAPPENED TO ME MINUTES AGO I WENT TO THE DOOR AND THE SPOKE TO THE POSTMAN AND HE SWORE BLIND HE'D BEEN RINGING THE BELL AND KNOCKING WHICH HE QUITE CLEARLY HADN'T BEEN AS I PRESSED THE DOORBELL REPEATEDLY WITH HIS M STOOD THERE LOOKING MORE AND MORE UNCOMFORTABLE



A DAY OFF SURELY THE UNITED KINGDOM HOME OF THE WASPS HAS A PLETHORA OF FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS WHO COULD SECURE A PACKAGE OR AT THE VERY LEAST BE TRUSTED NOT TO MAKE OFF WITH IT
YOU TOOK A DAY OFF TO RECEIVE A PARCEL WHY NOT GET IT DELIVERED TO WORK
LEAST YOU HAVE THE BOOK THOUGH

WHY DO YOU HAVE THE BOOK ACTUALLY DO YOU LIKE TO WATCH TV TOGETHER
THEY'RE THE SAME THING AREN'T THEY
IF I HEAR THAT SONG ONE MORE TIME I WILL GO NUTS
IT'S THE KIND OF SONG THAT I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME UNDERSTAND HOW IT GOT POPULAR OR WHY ANYBODY WOULD ACTIVELY WANT TO LISTEN TO IT SAME WITH JAMES SAY YOU WON'T LET GO

THOUGH THIS PARTICULAR SONG IS A COVER OF DANCING ON MY OWN I SUPPOSE THE ORIGINAL WAS OKAY BUT I WOULDN'T BE TOO BOTHERED IF I NEVER HEARD IT AGAIN
I'M WITH YOU MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WILL HAVE JUST THAT ONE SONG ON REPEAT BLAND PILE OF SHIT
THE ORIGINAL VERSION IS SO MUCH BETTER

I WORK PART TIME IN A RESTAURANT AND WE HAVE THE SAME PLAYLIST PLAYING OVER AND OVER

MEANS I HEAR THE SONG AT LEAST TIMES ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER TIMES I'D HEAR IT DURING THE REGULAR DAY

EDIT IT'S NOT EVEN GOOD
I FEAR LOCAL RADIO ARE AT BLAME FOR THIS FREERADIO HAVE JUST HAD THEIR BIG GIG LAST NIGHT IT INCLUDED SUCH BIG ACTS AS CRAIG DAVID OLLY BURS LITTLE MIX AND ALUM SCOTT
NEITHER DO THE PEOPLE HERE
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE SANE RATIONAL PEOPLE
PUTTING MILK IN FIRST NOT ONLY SATURATES YOUR WATER WASTING POTENTIAL FOR THE WATER MOLECULES TO BIND TO THE MOLECULES IN THE TEA AND HELP MATURE THE FLAVOUR

BUT IT ALSO GREATLY REDUCES THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER FURTHER LOWERING THE POTENTIAL FOR THE PROPER MOLECULES TO FORM AND COALESCE IT'S LIKE PREHEATING YOUR OVEN TO WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COOK SOMETHING AT

WOULD THERE EVER BE A SCENARIO WHERE THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NO IS THE ANSWER WE HAVEN'T HAD TO PUT THE MILK IN TO SAVE OUR SHITTY CHINA FOR YEARS NOW AND IT'S AN ANTIQUATED CUSTOM THAT RESULTS IN A WORSE CUP OF TEA
COMMENTS LIKE THAT ARE FOR THE FIRST OF APRIL
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE TEA
THERE'S HOPE FOR YOUR FRIENDS YET
WHAT
WHILST THE METHOD YOU ARE USING IS DEPLORABLE I MUST SAY SHOULD YOUR BRAINWASHING METHOD WORK BRAVO IF THEY BELIEVE THIS THEN THEY ARE PUTTY IN YOUR HANDS FOR BASICALLY ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF TO MAKE THEM DO
NICE METHOD OP RATTLE THE CAGE AND RUN

MILK FIRST IF A POT MILK FIRST WHEN TEABAGGING YOUR A BLOODY LUNATIC
ARE YOU MAKING IT WITH A TEAPOT U IF SO MILK IN CUP IS THE CORRECT WAY IF NOT DO YOU PREFER FIRING SQUAD OR LONG DROP
CAN I ADD TO THAT EVEN ON NON MANAGED MOTORWAYS THE PEOPLE WHO CARRY ON DRIVING DOWN LANES WITH A RED X AND I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO DO IT TO QUEUE JUMP I'M TALKING ABOUT THOSE ON A PERFECTLY FLOWING MOTORWAY WHERE THEY COULD JUST CHANGE LANES NO PROBLEM WHAT DO THEY THINK THE BLOODY RED X MEANS
I SEE THAT U APB HAS BEEN TRAVELLING AGAIN
AS OPPOSED TO REGULAR SHORTS
WHAT DO THE CELTS HAVE AGAINST BACK
I THOUGHT IT WAS CALLED CANADIAN BACON
RATHER THAN BRITISH BACON APPARENTLY THERE WERE SOME COMPLAINTS
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT
BANDOS DOES NICE FOOD BUT IT'S CAUGHT OUT ME AND SEVERAL FRIENDS BY THE LITERAL MENU ITEMS IF YOU ORDER A GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST IN ANY OTHER PLACE YOU'D GET GIVEN CHIPS SALAD ETC ON THE SIDE

MY FRIEND ORDERED IT HERE AND THE LOOK ON HIS FACE WAS PRICELESS WHEN JUST A CHICKEN BREAST WAS PLOPPED IN FRONT OF HIM

HE ASSUMED FROM THE PRICE THAT IT WOULD HAVE MORE
I CAN TAKE FOOD PRETTY HOT BUT HOT AT IS DEFINITELY PRETTY HOT
EVERYTHING OK

SNATCHES FLAG FROM TABLE BEFORE YOU MANAGE TO SWALLOW YOUR FOOD TO ANSWER
THEY'RE JUST ENSURING THAT YOUR DINING EXPERIENCE IS CHEEKY WITH SOME TOP BANTER OI OI
I SAW SOMEWHERE THAT SOME GUYS ON DATES ASK FOR MEDIUM BUT PLEASE PUT AN EXTRA HOT FLAG IN SO IT IMPRESSES THEIR DATE
BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE BEEN DO THEY REALLY ASK IF YOU WANT MORE CHIPS WHAT WOULD THEY DO CHARGE YOU FOR AN EXTRA PORTION OR JUST SPRINKLE A FEW EXTRA ON YOUR PLATE
IT'S WEIRD

THAT SHOULD BE THEIR BLOODY TAGLINE WELCOME TO IT'S WEIRD HERE
FREAKS ME THE FUCK OUT ANY PLACE THAT'S THAT EXPENSIVE BUT I HAVE TO GET MY OWN CUTLERY AND GET OUT MY SEAT TO ORDER IS JUST BACKWARDS SPOONS IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP AND MORE OF A PUB BUT NEEDS TO SORT IT OUT THEN THE STAFF EXPECT A TIP WHEN I'VE DONE ALL THE WORK
BUYS HALF CHICKEN FROM BANDOS SPENDS MINS CUTTING INTO THAT CHICKEN WITH THE SIDE OF A SPOON AS ITS SHARPER THAN THE KNIFE THEY GIVE YOU
BEING A WHITE MALE IN MY TWENTIES THE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT LOOK WHEN ORDERING EXTRA HOT ANYTHING NEVER GREW ON ME
I CAN MANAGE HOT FOOD DO A DEGREE BUT THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO BANDOS I ORDERED HOT AND WHILST I MANAGED TO EAT IT IT WAS A STRUGGLE
I LOVE BANDOS BUT THE STAFF ALWAYS COME AND ASK ME IF MY FOOD'S OK WHEN I'VE GOT MY MOUTH FULL

PERSONALLY I LIKE THE WILD HERB SAUCE THE BEST
ONLY PUT YOUR FUCKING FOOT DOWN YOU DAWDLING BASTARDS I'M IN A HURRY
THERE IS A SPOT IN MY LOCAL SHOPPING CENTER WHERE YOU CAN SEE ALL THREE POUNDLANDS AT ONCE
THE BLOODY CHEEK OF IT I WAS BROWSING MY LOCAL PONDOLAND TODAY WHEN A SHELF OF AFTER EIGHTS CHOCOLATE MINTS CAUGHT MY EYE I CONTEMPLATED MAKING A PURCHASE BUT SOON NOTICED THE SIGN THAT SAID AFTER EIGHTS 2 FOR THIS IS PONDOLAND EMPHASIS ON THE WORD POUND ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGED THE SIGN SHOULD HAVE READ AFTER EIGHTS FOR
WITH EACH PASSING WEEK IT SEEMS MY PREFERRED BRANCH OF PONDOLAND HAS REMOVED TWO SHELVES OF POUND ITEM AND REPLACED THEM WITH MULTIPOUND ITEMS IT'S THE END OF AN ERA
BREVIT BRITAIN INFIT
MUST BE ANOTHER VICTIM OF INFLATION
I REMEMBER A PLACE ON WATFORD MARKET SNEAKILY CHANGING FROM BEING CALLED TO IN AROUND SO THEY'VE DONE WELL TO HOLD OUT UNTIL

SAYING THAT THEY'VE PROBABLY GOT A BIT MORE BUYING POWER THAN ONE BLOKE RUNNING A MARKET STALL BUT STILL
THE ONE NEXT TO ME IS A PONDOLAND CLEARANCE MEANING THEY HAVE A LOAD OF NORMAL STUFF AT AND A WHOLE LOAD OF TAT THAT THEY NEED TO GET RID OF FROM WHEN THEY BOUGHT OUT FAMILY BARGAINS RANGING IN PRICE FROM ABOUT TO
INFLATION ETC THE ONLY TRUE DOLLAR STORE IN CANADA SELLS EVERYTHING FOR

THE REST ARE JUST SHITTY VERSIONS OF WILKES
I WENT INTO PONDOLAND YESTERDAY TO BUY THOSE NAFF BATTERY POWERED LIGHTS FOR DECORATING THE OFFICE COS WE CAN'T HAVE PLUG IN ONES SINCE THEY'RE NOT PAT TESTED EVEN THOUGH OUR COMPUTERS HAVEN'T BEEN PAT TESTED SINCE SEPTEMBER COULDNT SEE ANYTHING FOR I PICKED UP SOME DUMMIES FOR MY DAUGHTER AT 2 PER PACK OF 2 THEY WERE CHEAPER IN SAINSBURY

BLDR I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING FOR IN PONDOLAND
THE ISSUE I HAVE WITH THIS IS THAT THE STUFF THEY ARE SELLING FOR MORE THAN A POUND ISN'T SOME AMAZING BARGAIN BUT IN MANY CASES IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE SUPERMARKET


A POUND WHATEVER ELSE WE WANT YOU TO PAY FOR OUR STUFF


MAYBE THIS WAS THEIR PLAN ALL ALONG AFTER SWALLOWING UP EVERY SINGLE STORE IN THE COUNTRY
I LIVE IN THE ISLE OF MANUAL WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED DEAL WITH EVERYTHING UNDER GUESDE HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO SHIP THINGS ACROSS TO US
OPEN UP A TRUE POUND STORE AND FILL THE GAP IN THE MARKET
IT'S AN UNSUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL GIVEN THAT THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS IS GOING TO BE REDUCED ALL THE TIME DUE TO INFLATION
RECENTLY THE PONDOLAND NEAR ME REBRANCHED TO PONDOLAND PLUS MANY ITEMS IN THERE ARE MORE THAN A POUND

SO IT'S REALLY LAND THEN
UNLESS HE TURNED THE TUBE UPSIDE-DOWN LIKE SOME KIND OF ANIMAL HE MUST HAVE A PRINGLE FINGER THIS LONG SLIM APPENDAGE CAN SLIDE DOWN THE GAP TWIXT PRINGLE AND TUBE SLIP IN UNDER THE STACK THUMB ON TOP OF THE STACK GRACEFULLY WITHDRAW HALF THE TUBE

CUNT
FUN FACT YOU CAN ACTUALLY COOK A SAUSAGE IN A CRINGLES CAN IN A SUNNY DAY YOU CUT THE SIDE OPEN IN A SORT OF FOLD IT OPEN AND PUT THE SAULIE IN POINT IT TOWARDS THE SUN IT MAKES AN IMPROMPTU SOLAR OVEN

NOT IN BECKING NOVEMBER THOUGH OBVIOUSLY
TWIST THE CAN SO IT ABOUT BREAKS THEIR WRIST NEXT TIME
WHAT KIND OF MONSTER TAKES A HANDFUL YOU TAKE A STACK OF CRINGLES NOT A HANDFUL
CAN YOU QUANTIFY A HANDFUL PLEASE
ARE WE TALKING OR
DO THEY TASTE GOOD
THEY HAVE PIGS IN BLANKETS FLAVOUR CRINGLES NOW

I HAVE TO TRY THIS
I RIDE A MOTORCYCLE IN THE SNOW WHY IS EVERYONE SUCH A WIMP LET YOUR TYRE PRESSURES DOWN USE A HIGH GEAR LOTS OF CLUTCH SLIPPING

IT'S NOT HARD MAN
THANK FUCK YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY PERSON ON THE PLANET THEN
DO YOU WATCH A LOT OF COLOMBO AND MURDER SHE WROTE
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
YOU SHOULD WRITE TO FACOM
ARE YOU ENTITLED TO ANY BENEFITS AS A LOW EARNER IT'S NOT SURPRISING PEOPLE ARE HAPPY TO SIT ON THE DOLE IF WORKING MAKES YOU WORSE OFFICIAL
AND NOW MY BOILER HAS TURNED OFF AND MY LANDLADY DOESNT ANSWER THE PHONE AFTER AT LEAST WE MIGHT FREEZE BEFORE WE STARVE
I WOULD ECHO THE ADVICE ABOUT TURN ALSO LOOK AT ENTITLED 2 WHICH IS THE SAME THING

DO YOU PAY YOUR COUNCIL TAX OVER OR MONTHS MANY COUNCILS DEFAULT TO MONTH MEANING YOU DON'T PAY IN JAN FEB BUT YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO PAY IT OVER THE FULL YEAR IT'S NOT MUCH BUT IT CAN EASE THE PRESSURE

IF YOU ARE ALLOWED YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GET RID OF THE METER YOU PAY A HUGE PREMIUM TO HAVE THAT

YOU SAY YOUR MARRIED IF YOU ARE PAYING ANY TAX ON YOUR INCOME AND YOUR WIFE ISN'T THEN APPLY FOR THE MARRIED COUPLES ALLOWANCE YOU CAN TRANSFER OF YOUR WIFE'S UNUSED TAX ALLOWANCE TO YOUR OWN WHICH PUTS A YEAR BACK IN YOUR POCKET

FINALLY I WOULD SUGGEST HEADING OVER TO THAT SITE IS FULL OF AMAZING ADVICE ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH MONEY BENEFITS DEBTS ETC THE FORUMS ARE FULL OF PEOPLE IN YOUR SITUATION AND WORSE AND ARE VERY ACTIVE WITH EXCELLENT ADVICE

GOOD LUCK OP AT LEAST YOU ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND WORK TO SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY
I'M A MONTH BETTER OFF WORKING

MY TRAVEL CARD TO GET TO WORK COSTS
CRYPTO CURRENCY NOT PAYING THE BILLS THEN
TAX CREDITS CHILD BENEFIT COUNCIL TAX REDUCTION SCHEME ALSO DITCH THE PREPAYMENT METER ASK YOUR UTILITY COMPANY TO REMOVE IT AS YOU CAN GET DUAL FUEL DISCOUNT AND BETTER IF YOU DON'T HAVE PREPAYMENT
IT IS STAGGERING THAT ANY NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS HAVE FAILED TO DEAL WITH THE CLIFF EDGE ISSUES WITH WELFARE IT CAN'T BE THAT BLOODY DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE A TAPER TO VARIOUS BENEFITS OR FAILING THAT AT LEAST A PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT
AREN'T YOU ABLE TO CLAIM WORKING CHILD TAX CREDITS AND COUNCIL TAX SUPPORT
YES BUT NOW YOU'RE PART OF THE DECENT HARDWORKING NORMAL PEOPLE FEELS BETTER DOESN'T IT
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED EATING YOUR WIFE
NOT EVERYTHING ON R FRUGAL IS DAFT THERE ARE WAY TO HELP CHEAPER MEALS AND INSULATE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HEAT AND EAT UTILITIES YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY FOR BOOKS FILMS MUSIC AND GAMES FOR FREE ENTERTAINMENT AND IF YOU REACH A CRISIS POINT THE FOOD BANKS
I MEAN IF NEEDS MUST AND YOUR WIFE IS NOT EARNING YOU COULD LIKE RENT HER OUT FOR A FEW HOURS A WEEK
I'M IN A SIMILAR POSITION THE MATHS JUST DON'T WORK ANY WAY I CUT IT EACH WEEK SOMETHING ISN'T GETTING PAID FOOD FUEL RENT AND HEAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAT TV LICENSE COUNCIL TAX AND ANYTHING ELSE I CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR ANOTHER WEEK

GOOD LUCK
I PAY EVERY MONTH IN DEDUCTIONS FOR THINGS I DON'T WANT TO AND FRANKLY DON'T AGREE WITH
I'VE NEVER USED THE FIRE SERVICE OR SOCIAL CARE SERVICES

I DO ENJOY THE MORAL HIGH GROUND OF BEING ABLE TO SAY SORRY I HAVE A JOB SUPPOSE I'LL PAY TWICE EVERY TIME I GO TO THE DENTIST OR CHEMIST
NO RANDOM YODEL PARCELS TODAY MAYBE TOMORROW
DOWN MY ROAD WE HAVE THE WEEKLY LOTTERY OF HAS THAT IDIOT AT NUMBER LEFT HIS CAR PARKED ON THE CORNER AGAIN SO YOU CAN JUST ABOUT GET A CAR ROUND HIM BUT NO CHANCE YOU CAN GET A HUGE FUCKING BIN LORRY ROUND IT YOU FUCKING IDIOT DEAN

SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE THEM DAYS TO COME ROUND AGAIN WHICH I'M SURE ISN'T A PROBLEM FOR DEAN AS HE LIVES ON HIS OWN SO HAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR A FEW WEEKS OF LAGER CANS AND TAKEAWAY BOXES BUT FOR THOSE OF US WITH KIDS IS A PAIN IN THE ARSE

FUCK YOU DEAN AND YOUR STUPID FUCKING CAR
ALSO TO MAKE SURE SOME GIT HASN'T PUT A DOG POO BAG IN YOUR BIN
I PUT MY RUBBISH IN A BLACK BAG INTO MY BIN OFTEN THE BIN MAN REACHES IN TAKES OUT THE BLACK BAG AND LEAVES THE BIN OPEN I HAVE COME HOME QUITE A FEW TIMES TO FIND IT HAS BEEN RAINING AND THE BIN IS FULL OF WATER VERY ANNOYING
I HAVE THE WHERE HAVE THEY PUT THE BIN THIS WEEK FOLLOWED THE LOOK SOMETIMES DISAPPOINTMENT AS THEY RANDOMLY DON'T EMPTY ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE RECYCLING BINS
OH MATE THIS A MILLION TIMES THIS I FEEL YOUR PAIN FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE LET THE PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN WHO WANT TO ESCAPE THE SHUDDERING HELL OF INSERT NAME OF CHOICE S METAL TUBES OF DESPAIR GET OFF THE TRAIN BEFORE EVEN ATTEMPTING TO TAKE THEIR PLACE ON THE RAIL BOUND IT'S NOT COMPLICATED
THE WAY THEY REPEATEDLY STAB IT LIKE IT'LL ADMIT DEFEAT AND OPEN ANYWAY BEFORE GIVING UP PROBABLY THE SAME PEOPLE THAT DO IT TO PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS
HIGH SPEED IS THE WORST IT TAKES ABOUT SECONDS FOR THE DOOR TO OPEN AND PEOPLE REPEATABLE JABBING THE BUTTON IS SO ANNOYING
YOU MEAN THEY DON'T DO THE CORRECT WAY OF HOVERING THIER HAND OVER THE BUTTON THEN JABBING IT LIKE A FUCKING COBRA AS SOON AS IT LIGHTS UP
I ATE A BOX OF LAST NIGHT I HAVE NO REGRETS
I'M DOING QUITE WELL I EVEN BOUGHT LUNCH YESTERDAY
I BOUGHT BEER SCREW THE LOT OF YOU I NEED THIS
APOLOGIES I BOUGHT A BOOK IN A CHARITY SHOP
I BOUGHT SWEETIES AND TICKETS TO SEE FANTASTIC BEASTS IN 3D AND I DON'T REGRET IT BECAUSE THE LOCAL LITTLE INDEPENDENT CINEMA IT WAS FOR TWO OF US AND YOU GET TO KEEP THE SPECS
I WAS VERY SURPRISED CURRYS WAS LIKE A BOXING DAY REHEARSAL
WELL I WAS CLOSE THE ONLY THING I'VE BOUGHT TODAY WAS A PACKET OF TOBACCO
THE ONE SHOP I'VE VISITED IS PONDOLAND WHERE I PURCHASED A BOX OF FRENCH FANCIES SEASONALLY RENAMED FROSTY FANCIES ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T TASTE ANYMORE FESTIVE THAN USUAL
TODAY WAS THE DAY I'D DESIGNATED AS CHRISTMAS SHOPPING DAY AND IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME IT WAS THE DAY THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED UNTIL I'D ARRIVED IN TOWN

I GUESS I GONE BACK HOME BUT I'D BOOKED THE DAY OFF FROM WORK SO SORRY
I BOUGHT FOOD AND THAT WAS ALL I DIDN'T EXACTLY HAVE A CHOICE GIVEN I WAS MILES FROM HOME
I BOUGHT CHIPS NOW YOU'RE UPSET WITH ME IN TWO WAYS
BEEN RESCHEDULED TO THE WEEKEND I LIKE NOT STARVING
TO BE FAIR IT HAS TO BE THE CHEAPEST GAME SHOW IN EXISTENCE IF THE TEAMS WIN PROFIT THE SHOW GETS ITS MONEY BACK EVEN IF THEY LOSE MONEY THE SHOW GETS MOST OF ITS MONEY BACK
BUY RETAIL SELL WHOLESALE HOW CAN YOU LOSE
IT HAS MADE ME THINK THAT I'LL SOON PICK UP SOMETHING FOR AND CLEAR MY MORTGAGE
WHAT'S THAT ONE WITH THE FAT MAN THAT LOOKS LIKE THE ROBOTS FROM THE FIFTH ELEMENT
THIS SHOW TAUGHT ME THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT A DISCOUNT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A FILM CREW WITH YOU TO SHAME THE SELLER INTO PRICE LOWERING
IS EVERYONE HERE A STUDENT I'M THINKING EVERYONE HERE'S A STUDENT

EDIT I DIDN'T MEAN TO START THIS
TIM WONNACOTT HAD THE BEST CATCHPHRASE EVER JOIN US NEXT TIME FOR SOME MORE BARGAIN HUNTING YES YES
IF THE SOLE POINT OF TV PROGRAMMES WAS TO MAKE A PROFIT INSIDE THE SHOW THEN TV WOULD BE VERY BORING INDEED
THE BEST ONE WAS WHEN I HEARD A PROMO FOR A RADIO SHOW ON UNSPOKEN COMMUNICATION

I WILL ALSO NEVER UNDERSTAND RADIO COOKING SHOWS
YOU SPELT LICENCE LIKE A YANK
NONE OF THE AMOUNTS ARE TRUE THOUGH FRIENDS OF MINE ARE DEALERS IN ANTIQUES AND FEATURED IN BARGAIN HUNT ONCE THEY SOLD A PIECE FOR ABOUT AND THE SHOW SAID IT WAS EVEN THE AUCTION PART IS CHANGED IT SOLD FOR YET THE SHOW SAID
WHAT IS THIS REFERRING TO
HENCE WHY I REFUSE TO BOTHER WITH TV ANYMORE SINCE THE INTERNET HAS FAR BETTER STUFF ONLY BENEFIT OF BBC IS DAVID ATTENBOROUGH
WE GET THIS BS PROGRAM IN AUSTRALIA TOO
TV LICENSES LOL
LAST WEEK A GUY REACHED AROUND ME TO PRESS THE BUTTON EVEN THOUGH THE LIGHT WAS LIT BECAUSE I HAD PRESSED THE BUTTON HE APOLOGISED BECAUSE APPARENTLY HE WASN'T SURE IF THAT MEANT THE BUTTON HAD BEEN PRESSED I SAID IT WAS FINE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE BUTTON AT THAT JUNCTION OTHERWISE THE LIGHTS DON'T CHANGE BUT SECRETLY I WAS SEETHING INSIDE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I HAD PRESSED THE BUTTON BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS LIT AND EVERYONE KNOWS YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE BUTTON AT THAT JUNCTION OTHERWISE THE LIGHTS WON'T CHANGE
THIS REMINDS ME OF WHEN I STOOD AT A CROSSING FOR HALF AN HOUR WAITING FOR THE GREEN BLOKE THOUGHT THE TRAFFIC WAS JUST REALLY BAD BUT NO I HADN'T PRESSED THE COCKING BUTTON HAD I
NOW HERE'S THE PROBLEM SOMETIMES YOU PRESS IT AND THE LIGHT DOESN'T TURN ON

SO IF THERE'S A CROWD AT THE CROSSING AND IT'S BEEN A WHILE YOUR CHOICES ARE

WAIT WITH EVERYONE ELSE AND SEE

LOOK LIKE AN IMPATIENT CUNT WHO THINKS EVERYONE ELSE IS STUPID AND PUSH THE BUTTON

THE RISK IS ENORMOUS
I FULLY SUPPORT PRISON SENTENCES FOR THESE PEOPLE
I ENDED UP IN AN ARGUMENT WITH A FRIEND BECAUSE OF A DAMN PEDESTRIAN CROSSING HE WENT UP AND GENTLY BRUSHED THE BUTTON ABOVE WHICH IS A LIGHT TO INDICATE IT'S PRESSING THE LIGHT DIDN'T LIGHT UP AND THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION ENSUED

YOU DIDN'T PRESS THE BUTTON I TOLD HIM STARING JUDGMENTALLY AT THE LIGHT

I DID HE INSISTED HIS FACE ETCHED WITH INSULT HORRIFIED THAT I WOULD INSINUATE THAT HIS FONDLING OF THE BUTTON DIDN'T QUALIFY AS IN FACT PRESSING THE BUTTON

I TOLD HIM AGAIN YOU DIDN'T PAUSING FOR A MOMENT BEFORE I SHOWED HIM THE LIGHT THAT LED CAUSE TO ME SUSPICIONS NOT ON

BEFORE ANOTHER PROTEST COULD BE UTTERED I LENT OVER AND FIRMLY PRESSED THE BUTTON FORCING IT SOLIDLY INTO IT'S SOCKET HIS INDIGNATION WAS CLEAR BUT THE LIGHT LIT UP AND HE COULD NOT PROTEST THE TRAFFIC THEN HALTED AS PER THE REQUEST OF THE BUTTON BLESSED BE IT'S PRESSING AND HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH ROOM TO COMPLAIN BECAUSE I GAVE THE BUGGER A LIFT HOME

I AM OF THE BELIEF THAT BUTTONS ARE LIKE OLIVE OIL WE ALL WANT THE FIRST PRESSING BUT NONE OF US REALLY KNOW WHY IT'S SUCH A BIG DEAL THE SECOND PRESSING IS ALMOST AN INSULT
NEVER TRUSTED THEM TO BEGIN WITH I ALWAYS PRESS THE BUTTON ON MY ARRIVAL REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY OTHERS ARE THERE YOU CAN'T TRUST THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING
ALWAYS HATED THOSE THICK FUCKERS WHO WALK UP TO A CROSSING LOOK AT THE BOX SEES THAT WAIT IS ILLUMINATED THEN PRESS FURIOUSLY THREE TIMES

OH FUCK YOU MATE IS THAT THE SECRET CODE TO MAKE IT GO FASTER CUNT
TO BE HONEST I'M ALWAYS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THESE BUTTONS DON'T DO ANYTHING AND THEY'RE JUST THERE TO KEEP PEDESTRIANS CONTENTION
IMAGINE THIS NIGHTMARE SCENARIO YOU COME TO THE CROSSING ALONE THERE'S ONLY ONE CAR COMING SO NO NEED TO PRESS JUST WAIT FOR THE CAR TO ASS AND CROSS BUT BEFORE YOU CAN GO A WHOLE LOAD OF CARS START COMING OUT A SIDE STREET SO NOW YOU WILL HAVE TO PRESS SO YOU PRESS BUT THE TRAFFIC SUDDENLY GOES AWAY AS QUICK AS IT CAME JUST AFTER YOU PRESS SO YOU JUST CROSS THEN A WHOLE LOAD OF CARS COME OUT THE SIDE STREET RIGHT AFTER YOU GET ACROSS AND THE LIGHTS GO RED AND STOP THEM ALL WITH NOONE ON THE CROSSING AND YOU'RE JUST WALKING ALONG AST ALL THE PEOPLE YOU STOPPED FOR NO REASON THEN YOU LOOK BACK AND AN OLD LADY IS ABOUT TO CROSS BUT THE LIGHTS CHANGE BACK AND NOW SHE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AGES COS YOU WASTED THE RED LIGHT YOU PRICK
I DIDN'T REALISE IT UNTIL NOW BUT I MISS THE JOYS OF LIVING IN A BIG CITY WHERE THE LIGHTS ARE AUTOMATED
PEOPLE IN WARRINGTON HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PUSH THE BUTTON
IF I'M THE ONLY ONE CROSSING I FEEL RUDE PRESSING THE BUTTON AND MAKING TRAFFIC WAIT I GUESS I'M PART OF THE PROBLEM
MAN I TRIED TO GET ON THE DLR THE OTHER WEEK FOLLOW THE SIGNS FOLLOW MORE SIGNS SOMEHOW GET OUT OF THE STATION WANDERING DOWN THE ROAD GET TO MONUMENT GO BACK IN THE STATION END UP BACK AT BANK EVENTUALLY GET ON TRAIN
I SAW TWO LIVE ROMAN CENTURIONS DOWN THERE STILL WALKING AROUND LOST
TIME AND SPACE OPERATE DIFFERENTLY IN BANK PASSAGEWAYS APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR AT WILLIAM IF THE UNIVERSE EVER DOES START TEARING APART BECAUSE OF US IT WON'T START IN SWITZERLAND IT WON'T BE THE LOC IT'LL BE BLOODY BANK
TRYING TO GET TO THE NORTHERN LINE FROM CHARING CROSS NATIONAL RAIL STATION AT THE MOMENT IS LIKE A FUCKING DARK ART EXIT THE STATION CROSS THE ROAD WALK WEST TOWARD TRAFALGAR SQUARE DOWN INTO THE UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE DOUBLE BACK ON YOURSELF WALK BACK UNDER CHARRING CROSS STATION AND BOBS YOUR UNCLE YOUR AUNT THE BLOODY NORTHERN LINE
PUBLIC TRANSPORT EXISTS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK AS FAR TO GET WHERE YOU NEED TO GO

UNLESS YOU'RE GOING COVENT GARDEN TO LEICESTER SQUARE OR CHARING CROSS TO EMBANKMENT OR VICE VERSA
WHAT REALLY GETS MY GOAT IS PEOPLE WHO CAN'T BE ARCED TO CARRY THEIR LAPTOP IN A BAG AND WHEEL IT AROUND IN CABIN LUGGAGE THINGINESS INSTEAD TAKING UP THE SPACE OF THREE PEOPLE RATHER THAN ONE CRETINS
I SAW TWO WOMEN RECENTLY NEARLY START THROWING PUNCHES DUE TO A WHEELY SUITCASE INCIDENT THIS WAS OF ALL PLACES IN M SOUTH

BIZARRELY THEY KICKED OFF IN FRONT OF A POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS BRAVELY PATROLLING THE SANDWICH AISLE HE QUICKLY STEPPED IN AND THEIR MIDDLE-CLASS INSTINCTS DISSUADED THEM FROM FURTHER ESCALATION
THEY'RE LIKE CARAVANS FOR PEDESTRATIONS AND SHOULD BE CONSIGNED TO THE SAME FIRE
I ONCE GOT PISSED OFF ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY DO IT THE STUPID BITCH WALKED RIGHT ACROSS ME AND I NEARLY TRIPPED ON THE WHEELED BEAST I HAD HAD A SHITTY DAY AT WORK SO LASHED OUT AND KICKED THE LITTLE FUCKER UNFORTUNATELY I FORGOT IN MY RAGE THAT I HAD AN INGROWING TOENAIL ON THAT FOOT SO I'M SURE THAT IT HURT ME A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN IT DID THE STUPID WHEELIE THING
WHAT ANNOYS ME THE MOST IS DURING BUSY PERIODS WHEN SOMEONE WITH A WHEELY SUITCASE CUTS YOU UP BY WALKING DIAGONALLY IN FRONT OF YOU

WITHOUT A CASE YES YOU CAN MAKE IT IF YOU'RE WALKING QUICKER THAN THE PERSON YOU'RE CUTTING UP BUT WITH ONE OF THOSE DRAGGING BEHIND YOU AT ARMS LENGTH SOMEONE WILL WALK INTO IT

DEFINITELY DESERVE A GOOD KICK

ON A SIDE NOTE ON ONE OF MY LAST LADS HOLIDAYS AROUND YEARS AGO AND WE ALL THOUGHT IT'D BE FUNNY TO KICK EACH OTHERS SUITCASES OVER AS WE WERE WHEELING THEM THROUGH LANZAROTES AIRPORT FOUND IT HILARIOUS AT THE TIME FAMILIES AND ABROAD JUST LOOKED AT US WITH DISGUST
YOU COULD JUST GO TO ANGER MANAGEMENT
IF I HAD TO GUESS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BUYING FOOD AND THEN HANGING AROUND CLUTTERING UP THE PLACE

THEY JACK THE PRICES TO DISCOURAGE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO ACTUALLY CONFRONT THE PROBLEM HELL AS A PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE TYPE I'M JUST IMPRESSED AT THE THINKING
THE RULES ON VAT FOR FOOD ARE COMPLICATED A LOT OF FOODS ARE ZERO-RATED INCLUDING COLD ITEMS EXCLUDING CERTAIN SNACKS LIKE BISCUITS AND CRISPS

FOOD WHICH IS BAKED AND DESIGNED TO BE EATEN HOT OR LUKE AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IS TAXED

COLD SANDWICHES AND COLD FOOD GENERALLY AREN'T TAXED BUT IF YOU EAT THEM ON THE PREMISES THEN THEY FALL UNDER CATERING BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING MADE AND EATEN ON THE SAME SITE CATERING IS TAXED

WITH GREGGS BEING A BAKERY CHAIN THEY'LL ALL BE SENT THE SAME SIGNAGE FOR THEIR SHOPS SO EVEN THE GREGGS NEAR ME WHICH IS JUST ABOUT BIG ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO FIT COMFORTABLY INSIDE OF AT THE SAME TIME HAS SIGNS REFERRING TO EATING IN
IT'S A PLANNING THING FOR THE PURPOSES OF USE CLASS THEY ARE OFFICIALLY A SHOP NOT A CAFE SO IN MOST CASES THEY WON'T PUT IN TABLES ETC
THEY WANT YOU COME COME ROUND THE COUNTER AND SIT IN THEIR LAPS
THEY'RE PROBABLY GETTING ANTSY ABOUT THE PENDING LEGAL ACTION FOR NOT HAVING CUSTOMER TOILETS IN BRANCHES WHERE THEY HAVE A SIT-DOWN AREA
MY FEELING IS THAT THEY'LL LOSE THE CASE BECAUSE THEY'RE BLATANTLY BREAKING THE LAW AND BEING AND ARE PROBABLY INSTALLING SEATING AREAS IN CASE THEY DO
I HOPE YOU FOLLOWED THE DRIVER ALL THE WAY TO HIS DESTINATION JUST TO EXPLAIN THAT IT REALLY WASN'T YOU BUT THE BLOKE BEHIND AND YOU'RE REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE WHOLE ORDEAL
I WAS QUEUING AT LIGHTS THE OTHER DAY AND BECAUSE I WAS WAITING I LEANED TO GET SOMETHING FROM THE PASSENGER FOOT WELL WHEN I CAME BACK UP I TOOTED THE HORN

REALLY SUCKED I TURNED TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY TO AVOID THE EMBARRASSMENT


NEXT TIME DOUBLE DOWN AND RAM HIS BUMPER
YOU CAN'T BEAT BEING HONKED AT THE INSTANT A LIGHT GOES GREEN
JESUS WHO HONKS THEIR HORN I'VE SEEN SOMEONE HONK THEIR HORN IN EAST LONDON AT A DRIVER TOWING A CAR BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T MAKE A LIGHT

AT WHICH POINT THE PERSON GOT OUT OF THE CAR BEING TOWED AND WALKED TO THE HONKED AFTER A BIT OF VERBAL HE HEADED BACK TO HIS CAR TO SHOUT AT HIS MATE IN THE CAR BEING TOWED TO GIVE ME MY FACKINS BLADE

THE HONKER DID A QUICK U-TURN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION

IT WAS A GOOD DAY HOPEFULLY THE PERSON LEARNED NOT TO BE A RUDE IMPATIENT SEE YOU NEXT THURSDAY


WAS HE SAT THERE ON A GREEN LIGHT
I ONCE HONKED AT SOMEONE AT THE FRONT BECAUSE AN AMBULANCE WANTED TO GET BY SO HE JUST SAT WAITING FOR THEM TO TURN GREEN NOTHING WAS COMING AT ALL
COULD IT JUST BE THAT DAVID WILLIAMS ISN'T FUNNY

HAVING SAID THAT IT DIDN'T STOP THEM MAKING SERIES OF CITIZEN KHAN AND MY FAMILY MANAGED SERIES WITHOUT A SINGLE LAUGH
COMING SOON TO BBC LENNY HENRY AND DAVID WILLIAMS IN A NEW COMEDY CLASSIC REMAKE
HE HAS AN EX WIFE AND A BABY TO FEED NOW
THIS SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM


I HAD A BARBER THAT CHARGED IT WAS A PITA MAKES KEEP THE CHANGE EASY FEELS TOO MUCH AND I RARELY CARRY CHANGE SO GIVING HIM AND ASKING FOR CHANGE IS EVEN WORSE
ONCE I HAD A CUT SO UNEVEN THAT AFTER GETTING HOME AND SEEKING THE OPINION OF MY WIFE I WENT BACK AND DEMANDED THEY FIX IT
OME A GUY LITERALLY HACKED MY NECK APART LEAVING ME WITH A GASH

STILL TIPPED
WHY SAY ANYTHING ELSE ITS TOO LATE NOW
IF YOUR A GROWN ASS MAN PAY A GROWN ASS PRICE

WONT GET YOU A GOOD HAIRCUT ON THE OTHERHAND WITH SOMEONE THAT SPENDS MINS ON YOUR HAIR WILL
THEY STARTED APPEARING IN THE SUMMER I'M GLAD THEY GOT RID OF THEIR TERRIBLE DRUMMER BUT THEY NEED TO EXPAND THEIR REPERTOIRE AND THE WAY THEY TRY TO ENGAGE WITH PASSENGERS THEY JUST WALK DOWN THE CARRIAGE PLAYING AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE AND THE GUY AT THE FRONT JUST THRUSTS A PAPER CUP IN FRONT OF YOU AND STARES FOR A FEW SECONDS

IN CONTRAST THE TWO GUYS PLAYING THE VIOLIN AND GUITAR ARE MUCH BETTER THEY ARE MORE COURTEOUS MAKE LIGHTHEARTED REMARKS BETWEEN PIECES AND DON'T PRESSURE ANYONE INTO PAYING
WE WERE IN LONDON FOR A BIT OF SIGHTSEEING ON THE NHS SPECIALIST APPOINTMENT SUBSIDISE TRAVEL GOD BLESS THE NHS AND I LOVED THE TUBE BUSKERS ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS PIPED MUSIC UNTIL WE TURNED THE CORNER AND SAW THE BLOKE WITH THE TRUMPET

QUITE SADDENED THEY'RE NOT PERMANENT FIXTURES
WHERE WAS THIS I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY TUBE TRUMPETERS
ARE YOU LIVING IN A DO YOU HEAR CANNED LAUGHTER WHENEVER YOU MAKE A DECISION IS THERE A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE REPLACING ONE OF THE WALLS IN YOUR HOME
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BUT GIVEN THE SAME SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
COULDN'T YOU JUST SAY NAH MATE IT'S JUST MY HOUSE IS RIGHT ROUND THE CORNER WHEN ASKED ABOUT YOUR PUB VISIT THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED A LOT OF BOTHER YOU NEVER NEEDED TO LIE IN THE FIRST PLACE
OF EPISODES OF TOP OF THE POPS ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY FREQUENT BOTH ON BBC AND A COUPLE OF OTHER CHANNELS THAT HAVE PRESUMABLY LICENSED THEM GRANTED THEY ARE HEAVILY CENSORED BUT STILL
I ACTUALLY LAUGHED OUT LOUD GREAT STORY
THIS IS FUCKING FANTASTIC I'VE BEEN DOING THIS KIND OF NON SENSE ACTS A LOT OF TIMES AND IT AMAZE ME TO SEE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A THING MADE MY DAY
HAH GREAT STORY OP I LIKE HOW YOU COMMITTED TO GETTING A PINT WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN EASIER TO JUST GET A BAG OF PORK SCRATCHING OR SOMETHING AND WAIT FOR FIVE MINUTES INSTEAD
UPON ENTERING THE PUB I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO BUY A DRINK SO IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE I WALKED IN AND WALKED OUT I THEN SPENT THE NEXT MINUTES DRINKING MY PINT LOOKING AROUND AND FREQUENTLY CHECKING MY WATCH AND PHONE SO IT STILL LOOKED LIKE I WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE AND NOT DRINKING ALONE ON A THURSDAY NIGHT I FINISHED MY LAST GULP MUTTERED F K IT THEY'RE NOT COMING AND WALKED OUT

THERE'S THE REAL PROBLEM NO SHAME IN HAVING A PINT ON YOUR OWN IN THE PUB JUST GRAB A QUIET SEAT AND SOMETHING TO READ AND SAVOUR IT


I ONCE GOT A BIT FREAKED CAUSE MY TAXI DRIVER WAS A BIT ERVY SO I MADE THEM TAKE ME TO MY PARENTS WHO WERE AWAY I HAD TO LET MYSELF IN AND WAIT FOR MINUTES UNTIL HE WENT THEN WALK THE MINUTES HOME TO MY ACTUAL HOUSE AT NOT FUN
YOU COMMITTED TO IT
BETTER NOT GET A TAXI AGAIN FOR A WHILE WHAT IF YOU GET THE SAME GUY AND HE THINKS IT'S A REGULAR THING YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BECOME A LOCAL
I THEN SPENT THE NEXT MINUTES DRINKING MY PINT LOOKING AROUND AND FREQUENTLY CHECKING MY WATCH AND PHONE SO IT STILL LOOKED LIKE I WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE AND NOT DRINKING ALONE ON A THURSDAY NIGHT I FINISHED MY LAST GULP MUTTERED F K IT THEY'RE NOT COMING AND WALKED OUT

WOW
HOW DID IT TAKE YOU MINUTES TO DRINK A PINT
GREAT STORY I USED TO BE LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME

THIS ALWAYS CONFUSES ME SURELY THE ONLY POINT OF LOLLYPOP PEOPLE IS TO HELP CHILDREN ACROSS DANGEROUS PARTS OF THE ROAD WHERE IT WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNSAFE

I DON'T THINK A CROSSING SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO ALLOW PEDESTRIANS TO CROSS SAFELY FALLS INTO THIS CATEGORY
I'VE JUST HAD A GREAT IDEA FOR PICKPOCKETING UNSUSPECTING ROAD CROSSERS
TOUGH ROAD TAG TEAM LADIES

A MONTH AGO I STOPPED OFF AT A MCDONALDS ON MY WAY TO WALES AT AM MINS LEFT OF BREAKFAST AND MANAGED TO PLACE MY ORDER ONLY TO BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WAITING AND WATCHING THE QUEUE AS THE MENUS CHANGED IT WAS GLORIOUS
IS THERE NOT SOME SORT OF CENTRAL TELEPHONE NUMBER YOU CAN RING
WHERE DID YOU END UP HIDING THE BODY
DON'T EVEN TRY REPLACING IT WITH A KETTLE FROM ARGOS HEALTH SAFETY WILL CORDON OFF THE BUILDING AND INVESTIGATE WHY YOU DIDN'T USE THE APPROVED SUPPLIER TO BUY ONE THAT COST
REPLY YOU CAN ALSO PICK UP YOUR ON THE WAY THROUGH THE DOOR
ARE THEY AMERICAN OR SOME OTHER FORM OF COLONIAL
ALSO OK IN A TRUE EMERGENCY MAAAAAYBE YOU CAN NUKE THE WATER MAYBE IF THERE IS LITERALLY NO OTHER OPTION MAYBE BUT NUKING THE WATER AND MILK TOGETHER IS JUST HORRIFYING AND WRONG
I'M AMERICAN AND THAT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE
THAT'S WHY YOU USE LOCAL BUILDERS MERCHANTS ETC USUALLY FREE NEXT DAY DELIVERY AND YOU CAN RING THEM UP TO SEE WHEN IT'S COMING IN SECONDS HOW LONG DOES A BN DELIVERY TAKE AFTER YOUR ORDER
B Q IS TERRIBLE WITH DELIVERY TIMES XD
THIS HAPPENED TO ME A MONTH AGO WITH ANOTHER COMPANY HAD TO DASH HOME MILES THE GUY ON THE PHONE SOUNDED MIFFED AT ME WHEN I SAID HE MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT LIKE MINS FOR ME SINCE THEY WERE GOING TO BE EARLY AND THEY SAY THEY PEOPLE ARE USUALLY LATE OR NEVER COME AT ALL
IF THERE ARE NO MORE PASSENGERS GOING IN OR OUT YOU CAN PRESS THE DOOR CLOSE BUTTON THE DOOR WILL THEN CLOSE AT YOUR COMMAND AND KEEP THE HEAT AND THE STENCH OF HUMANITY IN
OFTEN A BLESSING WHEN ON THE NORTHERN LINE IN THE MORNING
PLEASE TELL ME IT WAS AT LEAST A FREEPHONE NUMBER
I'VE DECIDED TO USE MY KEYS
IF YOU PICK IT UP QUICKLY THERE WILL BE NO GERMS PURE SCIENCE GOD KISSED IT THE DEVIL MISSED IT
DELETED
MY EXPERIENCE WITH YODEL IS THAT YOU CAN CONFIDENTLY ASSUME THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DELIVER YOUR PARCEL
CHECK WHEELIE BINS CHECK YOUR ROOF CHECK THE BACK GARDEN OF THE BLOKE THAT RESIDES THREE STREETS AWAY

CHANCES ARE IT WAS DELIVERED THERE
FUCKING YODEL I JUST WENT ONTO THE TRACKER TODAY FOR MY PARCEL A LAPTOP FROM CHINA AND FOUND THAT IT'S BEEN RETURNED TO SENDER TRANSLATION SOMEONE THOUGHT THE PACKAGE WAS WORTH A FEW BOB AND NICKED IT
NOT SAYING THEY'RE COMING BUT AMAZON DELIVER UNTIL
AS AN ONLINE REPUTATION MANAGER I AM STRONGLY DRAWN TO THIS COMPANY DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE MIL TO SPARE
AYE I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO OFFICIALLY CALL THEMSELVES A DELIVERY COMPANY
I HAVE HAD A GRAND TOTAL OF TWO PARCELS DELIVERED BY YODEL BOTH WERE COMPLETE FAILURES

THE FIRST WAS MEANT TO BE DELIVERED ON A SATURDAY SO I SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY AT HOME WITHOUT IT BEING DELIVERED I THEN WENT OUT FOR THE EVENING AND RETURNED HOME TO DISCOVER A WE TRIED TO DELIVER YOUR PARCEL NOTE WITH THE TIME WRITTEN IN AS

THE SECOND DELIVERY ATTEMPT RESULTED IN MY PARCEL BEING LEFT OUTSIDE MY HOUSE BECAUSE I WASN'T AT HOME TO RECEIVE IT THIS WAS DESPITE ME SPECIFYING IN THE ORIGINAL ORDER THAT I DID NOT WANT THE PARCEL LEFT IN A SAFE PLACE IF I WASN'T AROUND THERE AGAIN THEY DIDN'T LEAVE THE PARCEL IN A SAFE PLACE BECAUSE THEY LEFT IT OUTSIDE WITHOUT COVER IN THE RAIN DAMAGING THE BRAND NEW LAPTOP I HAD ORDERED BEYOND REPAIR

THE SECOND PARCEL HAD AN ATTEMPTED DELIVERY WHILE I WAS OUT AND WAS LEFT WITH A NEIGHBOUR DESPITE ME AGAIN SPECIFYING THAT I DIDN'T WANT IT LEFT SOMEWHERE ELSE IF I WASN'T THERE TO RECEIVE IT THE PROBLEM THIS TIME WAS THAT THE DELIVERY NOTE THAT WAS POPPED THROUGH MY LETTERBOX HAD THE WRONG HOUSE NUMBER WRITTEN ON IT FOR THE NEIGHBOUR THE PARCEL WAS LEFT WITH MEANING I HAD TO TRAIL AROUND THE HOUSES ON MY STREET UNTIL I FOUND THE PERSON THAT DID HAVE MY PARCEL

I EVENTUALLY DID FIND IT TWO DAYS LATER WITH A VERY CONFUSED PERSON LIVING RIGHT AT THE OTHER END OF MY ROAD WHOSE HOUSE NUMBER WAS NOT REMOTELY CLOSE TO WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE CARD

AND THAT'S WHY I NOW REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS WITH ANYONE THAT USES YODEL AS THEIR DELIVERY COMPANY
FUCKING BASTARDS DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON YODEL
UNBELIEVABLE STORY AHEAD

I ORDERED SOMETHING ONLINE RECENTLY AND GOT THE DREADED EMAIL IT'D BE DELIVERED BY YODEL

THEY SAID THEY'D DELIVER IT TODAY AND REMARKABLY THEY ACTUALLY DID THE GUY WAS PLEASANT AND THE PARCEL ISN'T DAMAGED

I KNOW IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE FIRST AND LAST TIME ETC
MY FAVOURITE SO FAR IS GARY
YAY OLDHAM IS BEING MENTIONED FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN HOW POOR IT IS I FEEL SOME PRIDE SWELLING UP INSIDE OF ME
THEY STILL DOING THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IT 2 HOURS AGO
GRITS OUT FOR HARAMBEE
MAKES YA PROUD TO BE BRITISH DON'T IT
I'M NOT EITHER I ALSO DON'T WATCH ANYTHING WITH PEOPLE IN SEQUINS PEOPLE ON A FIELD KICKING A BALL PEOPLE FROM ESSEX WITHOUT TALENT PEOPLE ON TV WITH TALENT WHO DON'T HAVE TALENT OR ANYTHING WHERE PEOPLE GET VOTED OFFICIAL I ALSO DISLIKE MIDSUMMER MURDERS
I ACTIVELY AVOID ALL THOSE TYPES OF SHOWS IN FACT THE ONLY THING I WATCH ON TV AT THE MOMENT IS PLANET EARTH 2
I WON'T WATCH IT ESPECIALLY BUT FUCK IF IT ISN'T FUN WHEN MY WIFE HAS IT ON AND I CATCH A BIT I'M ILL HELP ME
I HAVEN'T WATCHED TV IN A LONG TIME IT'S ALL YOUTUBE AND NETFLIX THESE DAYS
YOU'RE NOT CAN'T STAND I'M A CELEB I'D RATHER WATCH PAINT DRY
WELL I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ON TILL I READ YOUR POST SO I WIN
NOT ALONE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IS IN THERE THIS YEAR
I'M NOT PEOPLE ASK ME WHY I DON'T SAY AN AWFUL LOT BUT ALL THEY TALK ABOUT IS TV SHOWS THAT I DON'T WATCH HOW CAN I CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS IF I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE TOPIC
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE IT'S A BAG OF HITE
HONESTLY I DON'T LIKE ANY OF THAT CRAP BIG BROTHER STRICTLY COME DANCING BRITAINS GOT TALENT THE ONE IN THE JUNGLE THE ONLY TYPE OF SHOWS I ENJOY ARE THE DETECTIVE SERIES I WANT ANOTHER LUTHER
I AGREE I DOT WANT TO WATCH PEOPLE EATING GROSS THINGS CRAWLING THROUGH GROSS THINGS I JUST DON'T GET IT YOU EITHER AREN'T BOTHERED ABOUT IT SO IT'S NO CHALLENGE OR YOU ARE BOTHERED ABOUT IT SO THEN WHY ARE YOU DOING IT AS A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT IT'S JUST REPETATITIVE OH LOOK ANOTHER PERSON DOING SOMETHING GROSS BORING
NOR ME I WON'T LET THE BOY WATCH IT EITHER EVEN THOUGH HIS MATES DO I'VE TOLD HIM EVERY TIME YOU WATCH SOMEONE EAT A KANGAROO BOLLOCK A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR BRAIN DIES

HE'S KILLING ENOUGH OF THEM WITH THE DABBING AND THE BOTTLE FLIPPING
WORRY NOT YOU ARE NOT ALONE
THERE ARE PLENTY OF US YOU CAN COUNT AS BRETHREN
YOU'RE NOT I WASN'T EVEN AWARE IT WAS ON AT THE MOMENT
I'VE NEVER WATCHED AN EPISODE EITHER I SALUTE YOU SIR MADAM
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
NEVER WATCHED A MINUTE OF ANY SERIES AND I PLAN TO KEEP IT THAT WAY
HEY DID YOU HEAR THAT MARTIN ROBERTS IS ENTERING THE JUNGLE
I USUALLY WATCH IT BUT THIS YEAR IT JUST LOOKS SHIT
CELEBRITIES ARE PEOPLE IN OUR CULTURE THAT WE CELEBRATE RIGHT
THERE IS NOTHING THAT EVER COULD PERSUADE ME TO WATCH THAT SAD EXCUSE OF A PROGRAMME
DELETED
I LIKE TO MESSAGE THEM JUST SEEN YOUR MATE IF THEY'RE NOT WITH ME TOO
OR WHEN YOU SEE A FRIEND WITH SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF YOUR SOCIAL GROUP

OOOH FOOTBALL FRIEND
SEEING A RANDOM WOMAN AND SAYING SEE HER THAT'S YOUR MUM THAT IS
DIDN'T LADBIBLE POST THIS EARLIER
OR AN UNATTRACTIVE PERSON AND SAYING

OH THERE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND GEOFF AGAIN
FRIEND

TWO THUMBS UP
I DO THAT WITH FRIENDS I SAY THERE GOES YOUR GYNAECOLOGIST LOL
I DON'T FANCY YOURS MUCH WHEN YOU SEE TWO WOMEN ONE HOT ONE LESS SO
THIS WILL BE DIGESTIVE EXCUSE FOR REDUCING THE SIZE BUT STILL CHARGING THE SAME
JUST CONSIDER IT AN INVITATION TO WARM SOME STROOPWAFELS ON TOP
BUT PERFECT FOR MY RICH TEA
AH YES THE EMERGENCY MUGS
YOU'VE JUST GIVEN ME AN INCREDIBLE IDEA MARK MY WORDS YOU SHALL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN AND WILL REGARD ME AS YOUR MESSIAH
TAKE A BISCUIT WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO MUG SHOPPING OR BUY SOMETHING FROM SPORTS DIRECT AND GET A FREE BUCKET EITHER WAY YOU CAN THEN DUNK IN THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN HOME OR OFFICE
THERE IS A SOLUTION RADICAL AS IT MIGHT SEEM BREAK THE BISCUIT IN HALF THIS SIMPLE BUT RISKY PROCEDURE NOT ONLY ALLOWS DUNKING IN MOST MUGS BUT GIVES YOU TWO BISCUITS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE
YOU THINK THIS SHIT IS TO BE EASY

WE DIDN'T FORGE OURSELVES AN EMPIRE BY HAVING CONVENIENTLY SIZED BISCUITS MY FRIEND
HANG ON PEOPLE DUNK BISCUITS

YOU BLOODY HEATHENS
WOULD ONE OF THOSE DIGESTIVE BISCUITS FIT INTO THIS LUDICROUS MUG LONGWAYS
GOOD CASE FOR AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD
THOSE WOULD BE THE MUG CALLING YOU A PIG FOR HOW MUCH YOU DRINK AND BISCUIT
UKULELES HAVE OVERTAKEN RECORDERS AS THE INSTRUMENT IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS THIS IS MOSTLY FOR THE TEACHERS BENEFIT AS A ROOM FULL OF UKULELES IS INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO THE BANSHEE SHRIEK OF THIRTY FUTURE WORLD LEADERS SQUEAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH FRERE JACQUES
YES BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE VERY CHEAP AND DURABLE ALLOWING ACCESS TO LEARNING MUSIC FOR JUST ABOUT ANYONE THEY REQUIRE LITTLE TO ZERO MAINTENANCE UNLIKE A LOT OF BRASS OR OTHER WOODWIND INSTRUMENTS AND ARE BASICALLY THE GATEWAY INSTRUMENT TO EVERYTHING ELSE I SYMPATHISE WITH ANY PARENT WHO HAS TO SIT THROUGH GRADE RECITALS OF RECORDER GROUPS AT SCHOOL BUT IF THEY'RE GOOD GET THEM INTO A MORE DYNAMIC INSTRUMENT NOT THE VIOLIN THEY'RE WORSE AND ONE DAY THEY MIGHT BE WORTH LISTENING TO
I WAS AWESOME AT THE RECORDER GOT PROMOTED TO THE CLARINET NOT SO MUCH
MAYBE THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL KIDS PASSION FOR MUSIC AT AN EARLY AGE SO THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO SPEND AS MUCH MONEY AT ACSE LEVEL
AND IT IS USO GAN AND PEASE PUDDING ON HEAVY ROTATION

OH YES AND THIS
BECAUSE I WAS GOOD AT THE RECORDER I WAS HAND PICKED TO BE THE POOR KID WHO GOT TO PLAY THE TREBLE RECORDER WHEN I WAS IN YEAR FOR SOME REASON THEY ALWAYS DID THIS TO TWO KIDS IN YEAR AND ANOTHER TWO GOT THE BIG RECORDER TENOR I THINK

ANYWAY IT WAS AWFUL BECAUSE THE FINGERING WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING PUNISHED NOT PRAISED

MUCH PREFERRED PLAYING THE VIOLIN EVENTUALLY GAVE THAT UP TOO BECAUSE I'M LAZY
THE DEFAULT CHOICE WHEN I WAS A KID WAS KEYBOARDS IF YOU ALREADY PLAYED ANOTHER INSTRUMENT YOU'D BE FINE BUT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE FUN STANDING AWKWARDLY IN THE BACK PLAYING NOTHING BUT CHORDS
DO REAL MUSICIANS HAVE RESPECT FOR THE RECORDER
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT USED IN REAL LIFE OR BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE SOUND
I THINK TIN WHISTLES SOUND MUCH BETTER STUCK WITH A SINGLE KEY BUT THAT WOULD MAKE THE ROOM SOUND AT LEAST KIND OF IN TUNE
CHRIS EVANS TRYING TO INTERVIEW JEREMY PAXMAN THIS MORNING
EVANS ISNT EVEN FIT TO SUCK PAIXHANS DICK
TRULY A MEETING OF MINDS FOR THE AGES
IT WAS FUCKING DIRE
WHY DO PEOPLE HATE CHRIS EVANS SO MUCH SERIOUSLY
HIS FACE IN BLACK AND WHITE A MILE AWAY ISN'T MUCH TO WRITE HOME ABOUT EITHER
HE LOOKS EVEN MORE PREGNANT THAN HE DID IN TOP GEAR
I'M STILL NOT SURE ON IT LAST WEEK I MANAGED TO REMAIN INTERESTED SIMPLY BECAUSE I WAS INTERESTED IN THE THREE HYBRID SUPERCAR BUT THE STUDIO SEGMENTS WERE BAD CLARKSON AND HAMMOND SEEM EVEN MORE SCRIPTED THAN BEFORE AND MAY JUST SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN UP I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS YET SO I WON'T THROW IT IN A HEAP YET BUT NOW EVANS HAS LEFT I THINK I MIGHT ENJOY TOP GEAR MORE
IS THE NEW SERIES OF THE GRAND TOUR SUPER BRIGHT FOR ANYONE ELSE OR DO I NEED TO ADJUST THE PICTURE ON MY TV
IF I PUNCHED A PRODUCER IN THE FACE I'D NEVER WORK IN THE INDUSTRY AGAIN LET ALONE GET MY OWN SHOW
I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN AWARE OF WHAT THE SINGLE IS SINCE THAT YEAR RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE WERE THE CHRISTMAS

IGNORANCE TRULY IS BLISS
BF ALWAYS BEEN ABSOLUTE FUCKING DROSS AT THE TOP OF THE HIT PARADE IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER AND FAR FROM EXHAUSTIVE BUT PURELY TO ILLUSTRATE LACK OF MUSICAL TASTE IS NO STRANGER TO ANY DECADE NAMES MIGHT NOT BE SPOT ON BUT YOU'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT I MEAN

AT ONE POINT THE NUMBER ONE SINGLE WAS A REMIX OF OH MY DARLING CLEMENTINE AND A RAP VERSION OF DO YOUR EARS HANG LOW GOT INTO THE TOP IN AMERICA SO SADLY REHASHING A FOLK SONG FOR THE BOOF ISN'T ANYTHING NEW
I WANT TO BE HAPPY FOR ANOTHER CLEAN BANDIT BUT THIS ONE FEELS LIKE MUCH MORE OF A DOWNGRADE FROM THEIR OTHER HIT THIS YEAR

ALSO WHY DOES SEAN PAUL STILL EXIST
IT'S A WEIRD SONG ALRIGHT AT LEAST IT'S NOT THE CHAIN-SMOKER ANYMORE UGH

CAN YOU BE AN INDIRECT DESCENDENT
HIS WIFE WAS MORE HAPPY ABOUT THE FACT SHE WAS A BLOODY PRINCESS
THEY'RE SCRAPING THE BARREL THIS SERIES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SIR IAN MCKELLEN OF COURSE
DOESN'T EVERYONE END UP LIKE THIS AFTER A FEW HOPS UP THEIR FAMILY TREE

IF THEY KEPT GOING HE WAS PROBABLY RELATED TO GENGHIS KHAN TOO

CAN WE PLEASE STOP TOUCHING THE KIDS
THAT'S BAD SO BAD


MIND YOU I'M PROBABLY HEADING TO HELL ANYWAY SO I BETTER NOT BE A HYPOCRITE

STEP REGISTER YOUR NUMBER WITH THE TELEPHONE PREFERENCE SERVICE


STEP 2 DO NOT ANSWER THE PHONE TO ANY NUMBERS YOU DON'T RECOGNISE SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR COMPUTER THINKING IT'S AN UNUSED NUMBER AND WILL ADD IT TO THE PILE OF NUMBERS NOT TO BOTHER WITH IF IT'S IMPORTANT THEY'LL LEAVE A MESSAGE OR


STEP IF YOU'RE NEAR A COMPUTER PUT THE NUMBER IN GOOGLE AND CHECK IF IT'S A SPAM CALLER YOU CAN DO THIS WITH YOUR PHONE AFTER BUT THIS WAY YOU'LL KNOW WHILE IT'S STILL RINGING IF IT'S IMPORTANT YOU CAN RING THEM BACK


STEP ADD THEM TO YOUR BLOCKED LIST


I DO THIS AND GET MAYBE SPAM CALL A MONTH
I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS AT WORK
I USUALLY ASK THEM AND HOW MUCH ARE YOU PAYING ME FOR THIS INFORMATION AND DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN GET THAT INFO FOR FREE
IT GETS RID OF THEM FOR ME I ALSO NEVER GIVE MY TELEPHONE NUMBER AWAY TO A SHOP EVER OR INDEED ANY ORGANISATION THAT SAYS IT'S FOR SECURITY REASONS IT'S NOT
YOU CAN ADD NUMBERS TO AUTO REJECT LIST
DON'T BE SILLY WITHOUT ALL THESE SPAM CALLERS HOW WOULD YOU CATCH THEM AND PUT THEM IN TINS
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAKE IT EASY AND LAWFUL TO SEARCH THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF SPAM CALLERS IT'S TIME THE PAPERS DID SOMETHING USEFUL AND NAMED AND SHAMED THESE CUNTS
I USED TO DO QA FOR VENT AIA PARTS AMONGST OTHERS THINGS BACK IN THE GUESS THINGS WENT DOWN HILL AFTER I LEFT
I DREAD TO THINK WHAT YOU WOULD DO WITH A STEAMED HORSE WE AREN'T FRENCH YOUNG MANUAL
OR MORE LIKELY IT'S DOWN TO A DODGY INSTALLER WHO HASN'T A CLUE HOW TO DESIGN AN EXTRACT SYSTEM I'LL BET THERE'S OF FLEX DUCT BETWEEN THE FAN AND THE EXTERNAL LOUVRE
MAKE SOME FANTASTIC EXTRACTOR FANS AS WELL DON'T BLAME THE MANUFACTURER BLAME THE BUILDERS WHO JUST USE THE CHEAPEST USELESS ONES JUST TO MEET BUILDING REGS
MY DRIVING INSTRUCTOR INSISTED ON CALLING ME PETE ALL THROUGHOUT MY LESSONS DESPITE MY NAME NOT BEING ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE PETE AT THE END OF EVERY LESSON I WOULD GIVE HIM A CHEQUE SIGNED WITH MY NAME AND PRINTED BUT HE NEVER PICKED UP ON THIS FACT IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE TEST WHEN HE POINTED OUT THAT THEY PUT THE WRONG NAME ON MY PAPERWORK THAT'S WHERE IT BECAME A BIT EMBARRASSING AND I HAD TO QUICKLY MAKE UP SOMETHING ABOUT NOT USING MY REAL NAME
ONCE HAD A GUY CALL ME DAVE I'M REALLY A RODNEY HONEST FUNNEST MOMENT AT WORK EVER
LAST YEAR SOMEONE RESPONDED TO SOMEONE ELSE SHOUTING DAVE AND HIS NAME WASN'T DAVE FOR THE MONTHS HE WAS WORKING THERE HE WAS RENAMED DAVE I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT HIS ACTUAL NAME WAS ANYMORE
PERHAPS YOU LOOK LIKE A MARION
DON'T WORRY THE WOMAN IN THE SANDWICH SHOP CALLED ME IAN FOR OVER A YEAR I'M NOT CALLED IAN LUCKILY WE'VE MOVED OFFICES SO THE LEGEND OF IAN IS FOREVER SAFE
MIGHT BE BECAUSE YOU WALK LIKE JOHN WAYNE
I SORT OF LOOK LIKE I'M CALLED EDWARD SO EVERYONE THINKS THEY'VE MET ME AT SOME POINT BEFORE AND THAT THEY KNOW MY NAME
ARE THEY REALLY THAT BAD IF YOU BUY THEM EVERY TIME YOU'RE IN THERE
IDL HAVE GREAT COOKIES IN MY OPINION THEY COST MORE BUT IT'S WORTH IT
ONES ARE
IN THEIR BISCUIT SECTION YOU CAN GET A PACK OF PEANUT COOKIES A BRITTLE AND CRISPY PEANUT BISCUIT THAT IS FANTASTIC WHEN DUNKED IT SOAKS UP JUST ENOUGH TEA TO SOFTEN THE EDGES BUT LEAVES THE CENTRE PART CRISPY

COSTS ABOUT GET BISCUITS

WOULD EAT THE WHOLE PACK IN ONE GO
I MIGHT BUY SOME TODAY
I GOT CHOCOLATE DOUGHNUTS YESTERDAY FOR TIME FOR BREAKFAST
SALTED CARAMEL MMM
IT BEATS PAYING FOR THEM THERE ARE CASH MACHINES WHICH CHARGE YOU A FEE TO USE OFTEN IN PUBS AND THINGS THAT IT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE IS USEFUL INFORMATION
THINK OF THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT OR CARD YEARS AGO THEY NEED TO KNOW ALSO I KNOW THAT IF I DON'T SEE THAT I AM NOT USING THAT ATM WHEN I AM IN AN UNFAMILIAR PART OF OUR BELOVED NATION
I THINK THEY NEED TO ADVERTISE MORE THAT ANYONE CAN USE ANY MACHINE MY DAD INSISTS ON USING AN ATM THAT IS PHYSICALLY CONNECTED TO A BRANCH OF HIS BANK
JUST COVER UP THE WORD WITHDRAWALS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
AS LONG AS THERE ARE STILL THOSE EVIL MACHINES OUT HERE THAT CHARGE YOU THEN THEY WILL KEEP PUTTING IT THERE IF I SEE ONE THAT'S NOT A NORMAL BANK ONE I'D BE SUSPICIOUS OF IT IF IT DIDN'T SAY FREE ON THE TOP
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE AMERICAN SERIES IS WORSE THIS YEAR
AGREED BUT PAUL HAS BEEN A SHORTY MANY DICKHEAD THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SERIES AND I WAS GLAD HE WENT
GOING TO TRY CRYING AT MY NEXT PERFORMANCE REVIEW
THE WHOLE A WASTE OF TIME HALF OF THE PEOPLE THEY'RE SELLING TO ARE ONLY BUYING BECAUSE CAMERAS ARE THERE AND A LOT OF THE DEALS THEY GET WHEN BUYING STOCK IS ALSO BECAUSE OF THE CAMERAS

NEVERMIND THE FACT THAT WORKING OUT HOW WELL SOMEONE CAN RUN A BUSINESS BASED ON JUST ONE DAY OF SALES IS TOTALLY LUDICROUS ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE BEING MADE TO SELL MAKE WHATEVER SOMETHING THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERIENCE OF
THERE SEEMS TO BE A SHOCKING LACK OF COMMON SENSE THESE PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSEDLY SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR LINE OF WORK YET CANNOT ORGANISE A PISS UP

I KNOW IT'S EDITED ETC BUT SOME OF WHAT OCCURRED BOGGLES THE MIND
LOWEST QUALITY FIELD OF CANDIDATES EVER THERE ARE USUALLY AT LEAST OR 2 THAT ARE NOT TOTAL NARCISSISTS OR THICK AS TWO PLANKS CAN'T SAY THAT THIS SEASON
SEVERAL CANDIDATES ARE GETTING WORSE WEEK BY WEEK SOFANE AND COURTNEY SPRING TO MIND THEY LOOKED HALF DECENT EARLY ON NOW SOFANE HAS THE ATTENTION SPAN OF A 2 YEAR OLD AND COURTNEY HAS LOST ALL PERSONALITY AND DRIVE AND IS NOW A DULLARD OF THE FIRST WATER
I LOVE IT PARTICULARLY ENJOYED FRANCES TWO FADEDNESS SUCKING UP TO PAUL THEN DITCHING HIM SHAMELESSLY
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT TASK WHERE NEITHER TEAM WON THE CANDIDATES SEEM LIKE ABSOLUTE IDIOTS A LOT OF THE TASKS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ABOUT WHICH TEAM DID LEAST BAD AS OPPOSED TO BEST
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CASE OF WATCHING PRATS FLOUNDER ABOUT WHILE TRYING TO DO WHAT SHOULD BE FAIRLY SIMPLY TASKS SUCH AS A COUPLE OF SERIES AGO WHEN THEY DIDN'T KNOW A ANDEL ABRAM HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH CANDLES BUT THIS SERIES HAS DEFINITELY TAKEN IT TOO FAR

I REMEMBER WATCHING THAT HERE ARE THE CANDIDATES VIDEO BEFORE THIS SERIES AND MOUTHING WHAT THE FUCK
ONE HOPES YOU HAVEN'T GOT AN ELECTRIC SHOWER AS YOU'D HAVE A POOR ELECTRICITY PROVIDER SHOWERING SHIT ON YOU IT'S ADDING SALT TO INJURY

SORRY
GET LOCKETS EVERY TIME
AND DON'T FORGET TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH BECAUSE THOSE THINGS STICK SOMETHING CHRONIC
LOOK EVERYONE IT'S NOT JUST US
M KAY
WHAT'S YOUR POINT
THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG GIRLS RAPED BY PEDOPHILE GANGS WHY AREN'T THE PRISONS BURSTING AT THE SEAMS IT SEEMS TO ME A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE JUST GOT AWAY WITH IT ONLY CELEBS ARE WORTH CHASING DOWN AS THEY'RE EASY TARGETS
WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING
ITLL BE OVER ON SATURDAY THANK FUCKING GOD
WHICH ONE IS THAT VALENTINE'S DAY
FROM WHAT I REMEMBER SAW A RECREATION OF THE MAYHEM VIOLENCE AND STAMPEDES OF THE USA HERE IN THE UK WHEN THEY DID BLACK FRIDAY FOR THE VERSION EVERYONE HAD WISED UP AND SHOPS OPENED UP AT MIDNIGHT FOR THE BENEFIT OF PRECISELY ZERO CUSTOMERS

I AM AMAZED THAT THEY ARE EVEN BOTHERING WITH ANOTHER GO AT IT ALL IN ALTHOUGH IN FAIRNESS THE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION HAS BEEN A LOT MORE RESTRAINED THAT THE LAST TWO YEARS


IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO BLACK FRIDAY THEN BRITAIN DEFINITELY ISN'T THE ONLY COUNTRY AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND HAVE IT NOW TOO SO DOES SPAIN FRANCE AND I THINK GERMANY THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE COUNTRIES WITH BLACK FRIDAY SALES THOUGH
BLACK FRIDAY ISN'T A HOLIDAY IT'S JUST THE FIRST DAY OF THE YEAR THAT US RETAIL TRADITIONALLY GOES INTO THE BLACK SO THEY MARK THIS WITH HUGE SALES THANKSGIVING FRIDAY IS A PUBLIC HOLIDAY IN SOME STATES BUT NOT ALL

SINCE THE MAJORITY OF COMPANIES ARE MULTINATIONAL THESE DAYS THEY PRESUMABLY NOW GO INTO THE BLACK EVERYWHERE SO WHY NOT MARK THAT EVERYWHERE I ASSUME THIS IS THE LOGIC I MAY BE CREDITING COMPANIES WITH TOO MUCH THOUGHT
IT'S NOT A HOLIDAY AND NOBODY I'VE EVER MET CELEBRATES IT IT'S JUST A DAY THAT RETAILERS WANT TO MAKE INTO A THING TO FLOG THEIR GOODS AND PEOPLE ARE QUICKLY REALISING THAT IT'S A BIT OF A MYTH THAT ON THIS ONE PARTICULAR DAY YOU CAN GET THINGS LOADS CHEAPER THAN ON ANY OTHER DAY DON'T IT
BUT THE THING IS THERE'S NO NEED FOR THE SHOPS TO OPEN WHEREAS THERE IS A NEED FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES UTILITIES ETC THE OTHER ARGUMENT IS THAT ITS A BREAK FOR THEM BETWEEN TWO BUSY PERIODS CHRISTMAS AND THE NEW YEAR

I DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR A PETITION THOUGH SURELY PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGREE WITH BOXING DAY OPENING SHOULD SIMPLY NOT GO TO THE SHOPS AND IF ENOUGH PEOPLE DID THEN THEY WOULD NOT BOTHER OPENING
NO ONE NEEDS TO GO SHOPPING ON BOXING DAY NEXT CERTAINLY DON'T NEED TO OPEN AT REALLY NEXT HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO OPEN AT ON BOXING DAY I KNOW IT SOUNDS MENTAL IT'S A CLOTHES SHOP FFS BUT GOOGLE IT IT'S TRUE
I FINISH WORK ON THE AND GO BACK ON THE 4TH YOU MAY GET ME OUTSIDE THE HOUSE TO EMPTY THE BINS OR BUY MILK OR AT A STRETCH GO TO THE PUB BUT FUCK GOING CLOTHES SHOPPING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

ITS CHRISTMAS I INTEND TO EAT AND DRINK MY WAY TO MILD ALCOHOLISM AND GOUT
IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT PEOPLE QUEUE UP AT TO GO TO NEXT BECAUSE THE SHOPS BEING SHUT THE PREVIOUS DAY WAS TOO MUCH TO COPE WITH

DON'T GO TO THE SHOPS ON BOXING DAY SPEND TIME WITH FAMILY FRIENDS GO FOR A WALK IN THE GLORIOUS BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE OR CARRY ON GETTING PISSED IN FRONT OF THE TELE
I REMEMBER WORKING ONE BOXING DAY WHEN I WORKED IN RETAIL AND HAVING A GUY HAVE A SCREAMING RANT AT ME ABOUT HOW IT WAS DISGUSTING THAT WE WERE OPEN ON BOXING DAY WHILE HE WAS SHOPPING IN THE SHOP GUY IF YOU DON'T WANT THINGS TO BE OPEN WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HERE
WE GOT DOUBLE TIME ON BOXING DAY WHEN I WORKED IN RETAIL I LOVED IT
I USED TO WORK RETAIL MANY MOONS AGO AND THE SAD FUCKERS WOULD BE QUEUED AT THE DOOR AT ON BOXING DAY THEIR LIVES ARE THAT SHIT THEY COULD BE BOTHERED TO GO AND STAND OUTSIDE A KITCHEN SHOP IN THE RAIN EARLY ON A BOXING DAY ARE THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY REALLY THAT SHIT TO SPEND TIME WITH
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS I HAVE BOXING DAY OFFICIAL IN EXCHANGE I GET TO WORK NEW YEAR'S EVE AND DAY

I DON'T KNOW IF I'M HAPPY WITH THIS
WORKING RETAIL AM PM ON BOXING DAY SIGH

I CAN'T COMPLAIN TOO MUCH CONSIDERING THE EMERGENCY SERVICES UTILITIES AND HOSPITAL STAFF WHO WORK THROUGHOUT CHRISTMAS DO A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT JOB BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WITNESS A FAT HOUSEWIFE THROWING A TANTRUM BECAUSE A CML TANGERINE POLISHING KIT IS ONLY OFFICIAL
IT'S ONLY THE PEOPLE YOU CAN SEE WORKING THEY WANT HAVING TIME OFFICIAL IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE INVISIBLE BUT VITAL COGS THEY WANT YOU WORKING
PEOPLE ARE GETTING FED UP WITH THE RAMPANT COMMERCIALISM AND MATERIALISM IN THE BUILD UP TO THIS STRANGE FESTIVAL COMMERCIALISM THEY WRAP UP IN HEART WARMING ADVERTS TO MAKE YOU FEEL ALL GOOEY INSIDE I'M NOT RELIGIOUS AT ALL BUT THE WHOLE THING DOESNT REPRESENT WHO THE FESTIVAL IS FOR IN ANY WAY GOING BY WHAT I WAS FORCED TO LEARN IN SCHOOL

R TITLEGORE
ONE DAY WHEN YOU'RE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS YOU'LL LOOK BACK ON THIS DAY AND THANK YOURSELF FOR IT
NOT AS BAD AS WHEN I ASKED FOR A BAKE STEAK THEN CORRECTED MYSELF BY SAYING SORRY BAKE STEAK THEN DOING THAT THING WHERE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WRONG BUT CAN'T THINK OF THE CORRECT THING BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID THE WRONG THING SO OFTEN I DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THE CORRECT VERSION OUT BECAUSE FAT SHARON HAD ALREADY BAGGED IT AND SAID TASS WAN DAHLIN
DON'T WORRY YOU CAN JUST GO TO THE ONE THAT'S ONLY A SECONDS FURTHER WALK INSTEAD
THINK THEY ALSO DO A CHICKEN BACON BAKE

YOU ARE NOW OBLIGED TO SAY THAT FIVE TIMES QUICKLY
SAME DILEMMA HERE BUT FOR SOME REASON I ENDED UP WITH A CHICKEN KANSU THING IT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY TASTY APART FROM THE FACT THAT EVERY BITE MADE FILLING COME GUSHING OUT I DON'T HOW HOW TO PREVENT THAT
GET A FESTIVE BAKE ON
GREGGS IS BUT A DISTANT MEMORY FOR ME WE HAVE A SELECTION OF BAKERIES IN MY TOWN
2 PASTIES FOR THEY DON'T TASTE ANY DIFFERENT TO ME EITHER
IN FAIRNESS THE CHICKEN IS PROBABLY TURKEY AND THE STEAK IS PROBABLY HORSE MEAT DROWNED IN GRAVY
NOT REALLY A BRITISH PROBLEM IS IT THOUGH JUST A GENERAL ANNOYANCE
WOULD YOU RATHER IT BE CALLED BLACK IN TIME FOR DINNER
THEIR

APROPOS QUALITY
FOR SO MANY REASONS THIS POST IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD
THAT'S A KILLER
WHY IS EVERYTHING ON THIS SUB ABOUT ADVERTS
I WOULDN'T ALLOW THIS TOWN HAS TWO AS IT SHOULD BE THIS TOWN HAS TWO ESCOTS

BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ASDA
I LOVE GOING TO ESCOTS ITS WHERE I BUY ALL MY EGOS
FINALLY AN ACTUAL RULE 2 OBEYING BRITISH PROBLEM THAT IS ACTUALLY BRITISH IN R BRITISHPROBLEMS
I LIKE TO ANNOY PEOPLE BY CALLING IT TESCOSES I ALSO SAY AS SAINSBERRIES EMPHASIS ON THE BERRIES
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF ANYTHING FOR MORRIONS OR ASDA YET
YOU'RE WRONG IT'S NOT TESCO

TESCO IS A BRAND NAME IT'S THE SHORTENED FORM OF THE NAME OF A ENTITY A LEGAL MONIKER FOR A BUSINESS

TESCO PLC OWN SUPERMARKETS THEY'RE SUPERMARKETS WHICH IS WHY THEY BEAR THEIR THE COMPANY'S NAME TESCO TESCO ALSO HAVE DISTRIBUTION CENTRES A BANK AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE EITHER PART OF THE PLC OR AN ASSOCIATED COMPANY

RATHER THAN SAYING I'M GOING TO TESCO SUPERMARKET IN MILFORD HAVEN WE ABBREVIATE AS TESCO IS PRIMARILY KNOWN AND WIDELY SO FOR IT'S SUPERMARKETS THAT IS ASSUMED THOUGH AT A DISTRIBUTION CENTRE MAY USE A DIFFERING CONTEXT OF COURSE AND IT IS VERY COMMON PRACTICE TO DROP THE PLC FROM A COMPANY NAME CONTEXT DICTATES THE NECESSITY FOR GEOGRAPHIC PRECISION AND IT'S NOT USUALLY NECESSARY IN NORMAL PARLANCE ERGO WE HAVE I'M GOING TO TESCO PLC S SUPERMARKET IN MILFORD HAVEN OR TO SPELL IT OUT WITHOUT THE OMISSIONS I'M GOING TO

NOW OFTEN PEOPLE REFER TO STORES AS A BRANCH OF THE PARENT BUSINESS IN THOSE SITUATIONS RATHER THAN SAY I'M GOING TO A BRANCH OF NEXT CLOTHING COMPANY WE SAY I'M GOING TO NEXT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T GO TO A LEGAL ENTITY SO SUGGESTING YOU'RE ATTENDING A BUSINESS RATHER THAN THEIR PREMISES IS SILLY BUT NEVERTHELESS WE MAKE THIS LEAP AND GO TO NEXT OR WHEREVER YOU PICK UP YOUR MANUFACTURED TEXTILE COVERINGS SUITABLE FOR HUMAN USE OR CLOTHES AS THE REST OF US CALL THEM

CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE THOUGH DOESN'T BOTHER ME THAT YOU'RE SO WRONG
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE GETTING A BIT MATE
I BLAME J SAINSBURY RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CONFUSED ABOUT WHETHER HIS SHOP WAS SAINSBURY OR
ALDAS ESCOTS ALDIS IT HAPPENS TO ALL OF THEM I HAVE A THEORY THAT THE POSH SUPERMARKETS NAMES END IN S'S SO THAT THEIR CLIENT'S DON'T MAKE THIS MISTAKE AND CAN FEEL SUPERIOR M S WAITROSE


THE WORD TESCO SOUNDS WEIRD TO ME
IT'S FINE FOR SHOPS TO BE REFERRED TO WITH THE POSSESSIVE IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE SIGN BECAUSE IT'S GRAMMAR RATHER THAN THE NAME ITSELF
SO HOW DO YOU COPE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THESE TEA BAGS ARE OWN BRAND HEHE
YOU SHOULD WORK FOR THE DAILY MAIL WITH YOUR CAPITALIZATION SKILLS
I BLAME
I ALWAYS JUST ASSUMED IT WAS A SHORTENING OF SUPERMARKET OR SHOP I E I'M JUST POPPING TO YOU WANT OWT BEING COLLOQUIAL LANGUAGE FOR I'M JUST GOING TO STORE THE STORE BELONGING TO TESCO DO YOU WANT ANYTHING
MATALAN GET THE SAME PROBLEM I STILL SOMEWHAT CALL THEM MATALAN
DELETED
YOU'RE NOT REALLY BRITISH IF YOU WERE BRITISH YOU WOULD KNOW HOW TO USE AN APOSTROPHE CORRECTLY
IT'S AN ABBREVIATION FOR THE SUPERMARKET THAT BELONGS TO TESCO IT'S SUPERMARKET
THIS IS AS ANNOYING AS THE YANKS SAYING EGOS I CRINGED WHEN I TYPED THAT
THANK GOD WOOLWORTH HAS GONE
WHEN YOU SAY TESCO IT'S SHORT FOR THE TESCO SUPERMARKET THE TESCO EXTRA WHICHEVER SPECIFIC ONE GEOGRAPHICALLY OR WHICHEVER PART OF THE TESCO GROUP YOU ARE REFERRING TO IS GENERALLY IMPLIED WHEN YOU SAY IT'S SHORT FOR SPECIFIC BRANCH PRODUCT INSERT HERE

HEY WHAT PHONE DO YOU HAVE

THE NEW SAMSUNG ONE

I HAVE NEW ONE

WHAT SHOP DO YOU WANT TO GO TO

THE NEW TESCO SHOP

LET'S GO TO NEW SHOP


BOTH CAN BE RIGHT IN THE CORRECT CONTEXT BUT MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY SAY THE ESCOTS EXTRA IF GIVEN THE CHANCE SO YOU ARE MOST LIKELY RIGHT PEOPLE ARE CALLING IT WRONG IN THE BACK OF THEIR MIND
THIS TOWN HAS TWO WHAT
I WONDER IF THAT'S WHY IT'S IN TWENTY FOOT TALL BLOODY LETTERS THEY'RE SEEING HOW BIG THEY NEED TO MAKE IT BEFORE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S SPELT
LIKE LEGO AND EGOS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
EXACTLY YOU WOULDN'T SAY GOING TO TO BUY SEABAGS NOW WOULD YOU
DO THEY SELL EGOS
TESCOSES
HOW ABOUT NISA

EVEN THEY PRONOUNCE IT WRONG

IT'S CLEARLY NISA BUT THEY INSIST ON CALLING IT NICER
LET'S ALL GO TO WHERE OP BUYS HIS BEST CLOTHES
PEOPLE HERE LEICESTERSHIRE PRONOUNCE IT ADOR WITH A SHORT O LIKE IN OFFICE
I CRINGE EVERYTIME I SAY THIS BUT I CAN'T HELP IT
I AM GUILTY OF THIS
FOR SAINTSBURY MY SOCIAL GROUP CALLS IT SAINS
I DON'T MIND IT IS SHORT FOR SHALL WE GO TO LOCAL SUPERSTORE
MOMZERS
FUCK THAT I'M OFF TO ESCOTS
WHEN PEOPLE SAY MACDONALD INSTEAD OF MCDONALDS
I ONCE HEARD SOMEONE CALL ICELAND ICELAND

FUCK SAKE
INCOMING ALTERNATES

BECCO MASTER RACE
WHAT ABOUT MENCER AND SPENCER
WHEN MY PARENTS TOOK ME SHOPPING AS A KID MY MUM ALWAYS USED TO SAY SHE WANTED TO GO TO BOMB MARSH WHICH CONFUSED THE HELL OUT OF ME FOR AGES EVENTUALLY WORKED OUT SHE WAS SAYING BON MARCHE BUT ACTUALLY SHE WAS STILL WRONG BECAUSE THE SHOP SHE WENT INTO MOST WAS DEBENHAMS
JUST FLOWS BETTER
ERE WHAT'S HE ON ABOUTS
R DWEEBPROBLEMS
ESCOTS
REMOVED
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS STRICTLY A SOUTHERN US THING HUH
I OCCASIONALLY PRONOUNCE TESCO AESACUS I DON'T MEAN TO AND IT MAKES ME CROSS AT HOW LAZY I AM
THEY DIDN'T RENEW JON HOLMES CONTRACT BECAUSE WE ALWAYS HIRE PRESENTERS ON MERIT NOW THEY ARE FILLING THE TIME WITH PEOPLE WITH SO MUCH MERIT THAT IT FLAKES OFF THEM LIKE TALENT DANDRUFF
I THINK IT'S THEIR THE NEWS ONLY COVERS I'M A CELEBRITY AND WHATEVER THE FUCK NIGEL ARAGE IS DOING SO WE PROBABLY BETTER TRYING TO DO SOMETHING EDUCATIONAL TO COMPENSATE SECTION

THEY STARTED DOING IT LAST SERIES
I THINK THEY'VE REALISED THAT THE NEWS IS BECOMING WHY TRY TO MAKE JOKES WHEN REALITY ALREADY MAKES YOUR HEAD EXPLODE PLUS THAT ROBERT CESTON HE'S A BARFF INNE AND THAT STEPHANIE FLANDERS HER DAD WAS A COMEDIAN BONNEE
WELL I FOR ONE LIKE IT WHEN MY TRAIN CAN STOP PROPERLY INSTEAD OF LOSING TRACTION WHEN BRAKING
YEAH I'D EXPECT THAT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR BUGS ME THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A MADE UP EXCUSE RATHER THAN REALITY

LEAVES FALL ON THE LINE PASSING TRAIN WHEELS CRUSH THOSE LEAVES ON THE RAIL HEAD INTO A REALLY SLIPPERY PASTE COATING THE RAIL HEAD FOLLOWING TRAINS NOW HAVE VERY LITTLE TRACTION WITH THE SURFACE I HAVE SEEN REPORTS OF TRAINS APPLYING FULL SERVICE BRAKES AND THERE BEING NO APPRECIABLE REDUCTION IN SPEED FOR OVER A MILE BECAUSE OF LOW SURFACE ADHESION

AS A RESULT THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL SLOWER AND BRAKE MUCH SOONER THIS MEANS IT TAKES THEM LONGER TO GET PLACES

WHAT IS THERE TO NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS


OOOH LOOK AT THE POSH BLOKE WITH THE TUMBLE DRYER
PUT THEM IN THE WASHING MACHINE ON A SPIN CYCLE FIRST WASTE OF ELECTRICITY OTHERWISE
THEY WILL STILL SMELL OF RAINWATER MAY AS WELL HAVE WASHED THEM WITH THE OTHER CLOTHES
CURRENTLY USING THE LAUNDRY AT WORK TO WARM MY CHEF WHITES THROUGH BEFORE I PUT THEM ON

YES IT IS THAT COLD IN MY WORK KITCHEN
YOU NEED TO INVEST IN A WATERPROOF MATE
NICE ONE PAL
PREPARING FOR OUR ROBOT OVERLORDS
REMINDS ME OF THE TIME I ONCE APOLOGISED TO A STACK OF CHAIRS WHICH FELL OVER AT SCHOOL BECAUSE MY JUMPER SNAGGED ONE OF THE LEGS
AMAZING
NOT JUST BABIES BUT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF MANY ANIMALS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SUN BEARS SUMATRAN TIGERS ORANGUTANS BINTURONG AND SO ON SEE IN A LOT OF THEIR PRODUCTS NESTLE USE UNSUSTAINABLY SOURCE PALM OIL WHICH IN ESSENCE INVOLVES BURNING DOWN FORESTS FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED OIL WITHOUT REPLANTING OR REHOUSING THE ANIMALS IN THE AFFECTED AREAS SEE THIS

WATCH V
WEREN'T THEY THE FIRM THAT WANTED TO OWN ALL THE WATER
MY BROTHER ACTUALLY WROTE IN A COMPLAINT LETTER OVER IT AND THEY SENT HIM A TUB OF JUST TOFFEE DUPLEXES
EVERYONE'S BLOWING THINGS WAY OUT OF PROPORTION THEY GOT RID OF ONE OF THE TOFFEES AND REPLACED IT WITH THE ONLY HONEYCOMB WHY DO PEOPLE HATE CHANGE SO MUCH
THIS VIDEO GIVES A QUICK OVERVIEW OF SOME OF PROBLEMS FOR ANYONE UNAWARE
BETTER NOT HAVE BEEN THE CARAMEL SWIRL
THEY ARE SCUM I NEVER BY NESTLE PRODUCTS
WHAT ELSE HAVE NESTLES DONE SURELY THEY CAN'T BE AS BAD AS CADBURYS
I'VE NEVER FORGIVE THEM FOR CHANGING THE PRONUNCIATION OF THEIR NAME TO THE CONTINENTAL WAY
GOOD CHOCOLATE
DEAR VODAPHONE TWITTER
THANKS FOR YOUR SMS ALLEGING YOU'RE THE UK NETWORK CAN YOU FIX MY INTERNET NOW PLEASE
FOR ABOUT MINS OF MY SCHOOL JOURNEY I HAVE NO RECEPTION LIKE NONE MY NEW NETWORK SPEED CHECKER THING TOLD ME I HAD ABIT S DOWNLOAD SPEED ABIT S UPLOAD SPEED AND PING THAT'S NOT EVEN ALL IT GIVES YOU A MAP LOCATING YOU BY YOUR DATA SIGNAL SO WHEN I FINALLY HAD RECEPTION AGAIN I HAD A LOOK AND I WAS GETTING MY RECEPTION FROM NEAR FINKSBURG PARK STATION FOUR POINT TWO KILOMETRES AWAY ACROSS NORTH LONDON AS THE CROW FLIES ACCORDING TO GOOGLE MAPS
I DON'T RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM THE NHS SINCE I MOVED OVER TO VODAFONE

THIS IS REALLY ANNOYING WHEN YOU LITERALLY CAN'T USE AN STD CLINIC DEAN STREET EXPRESS WITHOUT A MOBILE PHONE APPOINTMENT SLOT BOOKING AND RESULTS

ALSO THEIR MOBILE PHONE APP IS SPYING ON ALL YOUR APPS HOW OFTEN AND THE DURATION THAT YOU USE THEM

THANKS CODA MUCH LOVE
I HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGED BY THEM SINCE APRIL I STARTED A CHAT WITH THEM IN JUNE BECAUSE I NOTICED BUT THEY SAID WHEN I RENEWED MY CONTRACT I ENTERED UNDER A SPECIAL LUCKY DRAW WHICH MEANT I GOT MY CONTRACT FOR FREE

IT SEEMED PRETTY UNBELIEVABLE BUT I'D ALREADY GOT UNLIMITED CALLS TEXTS AND DATA FOR AFTER THREATENING TO LEAVE SO I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY JUST REALLY WANTED MY CUSTOM EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T PAYING ANYTHING

ANYWAY I GOT A TEXT FROM THEM LAST MONTH SAYING THEY HAD MESSED UP MY BILLING WHEN THEY CHANGED THEIR SYSTEM SO IT WASN'T A LUCKY DRAW AFTER ALL
THEY WERE FINED A MEGA AMOUNT OF MONEY MULTIPLE MILLIONS OF NOT MORE THAN A MONTH AGO FOR HAVING AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE NOT SURE HOW THEY CAN BE VOTED

BEATS O2 WHO LOSE SIGNAL FOR DAYS AT A TIME AND HAVE DONE A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW
I LEFT VODAFONE RECENTLY AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE WITH THESE JERKS I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THERE ARE MUCH CHEAPER OPTIONS
MAD THAT I WORKED ON AN INDUSTRIAL ESTATE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE FOR MONTHS AND MY VODAFONE PHONE COULDN'T PICK UP BUT EVERY ONE OF MY CO WORKERS ON O2 TESCO ETC COULD BEST NETWORK MY ARSE
CAN SOMEONE PROVIDE ME WITH GUIDANCE ON HOW TO CONJUGATE TEXT IF IT WERE A REGULAR VERB THEN I'D EXPECT THE PAST TENSE TO BE TEXTED BUT I'VE SEEN TEXT USED SO MANY TIMES I'M STARTING TO THINK IT HAS BEEN DECIDED THAT IT'S AN IRREGULAR VERB
THIS HAS BEEN MY LIFE FOR THE PAST MONTHS MY MOBILE DATA JUST STOPPED WORKING ALL OF A SUDDEN DESPITE DEFINITELY STILL HAVING CREDIT AFTER MANY CALLS AND EMAILS WITH VODAFONE THE PROBLEM IS APPARENTLY BEING HANDLED BY MISSION CONTROL AND HAS BEEN FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW
CRIKEY AND I THOUGHT O2 WAS SHIT
VODAFONE HAVE AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE SIT ON HOLD FOR HOURS TO GET THROUGH TO SOMEONE WHO CAN'T HELP YOU THEN THEY'LL EMAIL YOU LATER TO SAY THAT THEY'VE DONE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU ASKED

ON THE OTHER HAND THEIR HOME BROADBAND IS VERY FAST AND THEY HAVEN'T CHARGED ME YET I TRIED TO RING TO LET THEM KNOW BUT AFTER SITTING ON HOLD FOR MINUTES I DECIDED NOT TO BOTHER
IT SHOULD BE CLARIFIED THAT THEY WERE VOTED NUMBER BY CONSUMER EXPERTS NOT THE GENERAL POPULATION
VODAFONE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST
TEXTED OR AM I LOSING THIS BATTLE AND WITNESSING THE BIRTH OF A NEW IRREGULAR VERB
YOU MUST STILL BE SO STARTLED YOU'VE MANAGED TO POST TWICE
YOUR TRAIN CRASHED SOMEONE WILL BE ALONG SHORTLY TO LEAD YOU ON YOUR JOURNEY INTO THE AFTERLIFE
I HAD A HOLIDAY LIKE THAT AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF BLISS AND GOOD FORTUNE I WAS UTTERLY CONVINCED THAT WE WOULD PERISH ON THE PLANE JOURNEY HOME VERY UNSETTLING
I WAS SHOWERED HAD EATEN BREAKFAST HAD MY LUNCH PREPARED THE CATS WERE FED AND I HAD A CRISPLY PRESSED SHIRT ON THIS MORNING WHEN I LEFT THE HOUSE A FULL FIVE MINUTES EARLIER THAN I ACTUALLY HAD TO

AND THEN I DISCOVERED THAT THE METRO WAS COMPLETELY KNICKERED AND THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GOING TO GET TO WORK THAT WASN'T GOING TO BE UTTER CHAOS AND TAKE FOREVER
HAVE YOU BY ANY CHANCE SEEN DAYS LATER
IMMEDIATE PROOF YOU'RE IN A SIMULATION
I CANT BELIEVE YOU CHOSE TO JOKE ABOUT BOB DYLAN DYING IN IF ANYTHING HAPPENS IT'S YOUR FAULT
THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD IS FAIRLY USELESS FOR HIS COUNTRY THE TWO BEST PLAYERS IN THE WORLD DIVE REGULARLY AND THE PLAYER IN QUESTION PLAYED FOR LIVERPOOL AND STILL MANAGED TO WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GERRARD WAS FUCKING AMAZING PEOPLE CARE ABOUT FOOTBALL AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IN THE NEWS

BOB DYLAN HASN'T DONE ANYTHING SIGNIFICANTLY GOOD SINCE BLOOD ON THE TRACKS AND THAT WAS YEARS AGO
SEEMS WE'VE GOT A MAN U SUPPORTER HERE
YOU CAN DO THE ADD ITEMS TRICK AND YOU CAN SOMETIMES SEE EXACTLY HOW MANY THEY HAVE IN STOCK IF IT AXES OUT BELOW THAT
CONTEXT
IT'S NOT A TRICK IT JUST MEANS WE LIST ONE AT A TIME TO AVOID PEOPLE LOCKING UP OUR STOCK
SHE'S GOT A POINT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE EMOTIONAL

BTW I THINK THE POSH BOLLOCKS ARE CALLED PRAIRIE OYSTERS I HAD NO IDEA JOHN LEWIS SOLD THEM
BUSTER DIDN'T GET TO PLAY WITH HIS FRIENDS
I'VE BEEN AVOIDING CHRISTMAS ADVERTS LIKE THE PLAGUE BECAUSE GOD DAMMIT I'M CRYING ENOUGH BECAUSE OF MY DEADLINES I DON'T NEED MORE SAD TEARS
I'LL MAKE HER CRY IF YOU LIKE
I TEARED UP A LITTLE I THINK IT WAS THE MUSIC AND THE LOOK OF JOY ON THE DOG'S FACE
FNKNIZU LOL
I'VE STILL NOT SEEN IT AND I'M HOPING TO MAKE IT UNTIL WITHOUT DOING SO
I TRUST THEY AT LEAST ALLOWED YOU AS IS CUSTOMARY TO GET VALENTINE'S DAY ALL SORTED DURING AUGUST
HOW WILL THEY REMAIN COMPETITIVE
EASTER
MY LOCAL TESCO IS ALREADY STOCKING UP FOR NEXT HALLOWEEN THEY HAD CADBURYS SCREAM EGGS IN THE SEASONAL SECTION AT FULL PRICE
IT'S STILL EARLY YET GIVE IT ANOTHER WEEK OR TWO
HURR DE HURR HURR DAE CHRISTMAS EARLY
MY ISSUE WASN'T HEALTH AND SAFETY IT'S THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST ADVERTS I'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS IN FACT IT WAS SO BAD IT MAY BE A WORK OF GENIUS IT'S THE ATTEMPT TO START SOME SORT OF SOCIAL MEDIA HASHTAGGERY THAT ANNOYED ME MOST I THINK
IF I TAKE MY HANDS OFF THE STEERING WHEEL OF MY CAR I WILL SOON CRASH HOW CAN THEY LET THIS MADNESS CONTINUE THINK OF THE PEDESTRIANS PASSENGERS DRIVER THINK OF THE CHILDREN
YOU JOKE NOW BUT WHO'LL BE LAUGHING WHEN GRANDMA HAS MORTALLY SEVERED HER JUGULAR ON THE PASTA SHAPES CAN
IT'D BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE SE MYTH BUSTERS PANEL WOULD MAKE OF THIS
I'D COMPLAIN ABOUT IT FOR TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN THAT WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN

DIDN'T MARKETERS LEARN FROM GOOGLE YOU CAN'T FORCE PUBLIC BUZZ IT HAPPENS NATURALLY
I JUST GOOGLED IT IT'S NOT A FUCKING SONG IT'S A BUNCH OF BANGING WITH NO DISCERNABLE RHYTHM
MPH I AGREE AND IT WAS A SHIT ADVERT
WHO ARE THE NOBHEADS THAT HAVE THE TIME TO WRITE AN EMAIL MOANING ABOUT HITE LIKE THIS JUST SHRUG AND MOVE ON
GOOD IT WAS ANNOYING
WHY IS EVERYTHING ON THIS SUB ABOUT ADVERTS
APPARENTLY THOUSANDS OF A FEW PEOPLE COMPLAINED THE SEASON PREMIER OF THE WALKING DEAD WAS TOO VIOLENT

EDIT SOURCE
WASH A BLOODY MUG YOU GROT AND MAKE YOUR WIFE A CUP OF TEA
YOU COULD ALWAYS USE THE CEREMONIAL MUGS I'M SURE EVERY HOUSEHOLD HAS A BUNCH OF CUPS YOU NEVER USE
YEA BEEN THERE DIFFICULT A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A PHYSIOLOGICAL DROUGHT
JUST DO WHAT MY NEW RECEPTIONIST DID AND SERVE TEA TO A REALLY IMPORTANT CLIENT IN A TUMBLER GLASS BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T FIND A MUG AND SHE LEFT THE BLOODY TEA BAG IN
HOW CAN YOU ARBITRARILY DECIDE WHAT PORN PEOPLE CAN WATCH
I WONDER IF THERE'LL BE A SPECIAL ROOM IN THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT WHERE YOU CAN STILL VIEW SUCH FILTH IN THE SAME WAY AS THE HYPOCRITICAL CUNTS STILL ALLOW SMOKING
ARE THEY TAKING THE PISS
SO ARE THEY BANNING THAT PARLIAMENT CHANNEL

THAT'S FULL OF CUNTS SPEWING STUFF THAT BELONGS IN A TOILET
DAMMIT THEY'RE THE BEST SORT I HAVE ONE IN MY
IM DOWNLOADING LIKE THERE IS NO TOMORROW
WHY DO I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT ALL THE IN FAVOUR OF THIS SECRETLY ENJOY ALL OF THESE ACTS
WHY CANT THEY JUST LET PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY WANT AS LONG AS THEY ARENT HURTING ANYONE
THE FEMALE EJACULATION PART IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SHIT AT SEX
JUST PROXY TO A LESS AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRY
SEX ACTS INVOLVING FEMALE EJACULATION

SO LIKE MOST OF IT
THE GOVERNMENT SEEM VERY KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT THIS I WONDER HOW DEEP THEIR RESEARCH WENT
AND TOR DOWNLOADS HAVE INCREASED BY MILLION DOWNLOADS
GOLDEN SHOWERS WERE ALREADY BANNED
WHAT'S THIS NEW BILL CALLED SHARIA LAW
WAIT TILL SHE BRINGS HERS MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT PEERING OVER AT IT AND LOUDLY ANNOUNCE YOU KNOW WHAT NOW THAT I'VE SEEN YOURS I FANCY ONE
THIS IS EASY YOU SAY OOH ACTUALLY I DO QUITE FANCY A CUP OF TEA NOW AND GET YOURSELF ONE
THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THAT YOU TURNED DOWN A CUPPA
THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO MY GIRLFRIEND NOT ME YESTERDAY BUT IT WAS TOO HARD TO EXPLAIN THAT IN THE TITLE PLEASE DON'T JUDGE ME
JUST INVENT A DISASTER THAT NEEDS TEA
WHAT A MUG
THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY DRINK TEA TEA IS FOR LOSERS
THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY DRINK TEA TEA IS FOR LOSERS
WAIT

WAIT WAIT WAIT

WHAT
EVERY NEWSPAPER SEEMS TO CALL ITSELF THE NATION'S FAVOURITE OR THE BEST SELLER JUST LIKE EVERY SINGLE BOOK THAT COMES OUT IS APPARENTLY A BEST SELLER FULL OF SHIT
IT WASNT EVEN THE NATIONS FAVOURITE WRAPPING PAPER
THE SUN MADE A DS GAME

WHAT
WHILE IT MIGHT BE REPULSIVE AND DISHEARTENING TO THINK IT THE SUN IS ACTUALLY THE NATIONS MOST READ PAPER


I WOULDN'T WORRY EVEN IF YOU'RE STANDING AT THE OPEN DOOR YOU'LL STILL GET CARDED
THE TRICK IS TO FOOL FATE GET UNDRESSED AND TURN THE SHOWER ON PUT ONE FOOT IN AND THEN WRAP A TOWEL AROUND YOURSELF BECAUSE THEY ARE AT THE DOOR I ALWAYS LIGHT A CIGARETTE AT BUS STOPS BECAUSE I KNOW THE SECOND I DO A BUS WILL COME CHUGGING ALONG
DOES THE TORY GOVERNMENT SHAFTING BRITAIN COUNT AS CONVENTIONAL PORN
WHAT'S CONVENTIONAL THOUGH ONE MAN'S KINK IS ANOTHER MAN'S VANILLA
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT YOU DUMB CUNT OF A CULTURE SECRETARY GOVERNMENT BLOCKS HAVE BEEN SOOSOO EFFECTIVE AGAINST TORRENTS HAVEN'T THEY
A SINGLE BEAN ADVERT BEING BANNED IS BEING OVERSHADOWED BY THE SIZE OF TOBLERONE WHICH IS IN TURN BEING OVERSHADOWED BY CHRISTMAS BEING THRUST DOWN OUR THROATS EARLY THIS EVENT IN TURN IS THEN OVERSHADOWED BY CHOCOLATE NOT TASTING EXACTLY LIKE IT DID IN THE SOUTH
BACK IN THE AND WHEN THE CENSORS WERE SO STRONG THAT IN MEDIA YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO SEE AT ALL THAT BOYS HAD WILLIES OR GIRLS HAD FANNIES WE MANAGED TO GET OUR HANDS ON ALL SORTS OF EXOTIC PORN AND THAT WAS ALL THE GOVERNMENT THE POLICE AND THE BOFFINS THEY HIRE TO RUN AND MANAGE ALL THINGS LIKE THIS SIMPLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW AN INTERNET ACTUALLY WORKS I WOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS WHATEVER TAKES YOUR FANCY

THE WHAT NO NO NO RAW COURGETTE IS NOT NICE NOT NICE AT ALL
WAIT WTF
THAT'S ZUCCHINI RIGHT IT'S DELICIOUS HAD YOU EATEN SOME ALREADY WHEN YOU REALIZED IT WASN'T CUCUMBER
UNEXPECTED OPTION IN THE PAYMENT AREA
SHHHHH THEY'LL BE REEDITING ABOUT YOUR INDIFFERENCE AND IF YOU'RE NOTICED YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE CARRIAGE DISRUPT YOUR COMMUTE AND CHANGE TRAINS HAVE YOU CHECKED THE HOUSE PRICES THREE TOWNS AWAY
DON'T WORRY GIVEN THAT NONE OF US CAN AFFORD TO BUY HOUSES THE MARKET WILL CRASH WHEN NOBODY MAKING MONEY FROM IT ANYMORE JUST GIVE IT YEARS
MY MUM KEEPS JUMPING BETWEEN TRYING TO GET RID OF ME AND NOT WANTING ME TO LEAVE
DEPENDS WHERE YOU LIVE I GUESS MY WIFE AND I MOVED TO GLASGOW IN FEBRUARY AND WE BOUGHT LOVELY LARGE TWO BED FLAT IN OCTOBER FOR

AT THIS VERY MOMENT THERE'S FLATS IN THE GLASGOW CITY CENTER AREA THAT YOU COULD GET WITH SAVED UP OR LESS THERE'S IN MANCHESTER IN LIVERPOOL CITY CENTRE AND EVEN AS FAR SOUTH AS BIRMINGHAM

AND YEAH PEOPLE WILL SAY BUT IT'S GLASGOW TSH I DID BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S NICE ABOUT IT CERTAINLY COMPARED TO THE SOUTH EAST YOU GET TO LIVE A LOT MORE THAN YOU DID DOWN THERE I HAVE A MINUTE CYCLE TO WORK AND WE PAY A MONTH LESS ON OUR MORTGAGE AS WE DID ON OUR RENT IN LONDON

MY SALARY ACTUALLY INCREASED BY WHEN I MOVED UP TOO GOOD THINGS CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU MOVE

COMPANIES NEED TO START MOVING THEIR HAS OUT OF LONDON FOR THE GOOD OF THEIR EMPLOYEES
SELLING EACH OTHER EVER MORE EXPENSIVE PROPERTY IS NOT REALLY A SOLID BASIS FOR AN ECONOMY
READING SHIT LIKE THIS MAKES ME INSANELY GRATEFUL TO MY PARENTS AT I OUTRIGHT OWN THE HOUSE I GREW UP BECAUSE THEY LEFT IT TO ME MORTGAGE FREE WHEN THEY PASSED AWAY SUCKS VERY MUCH TO LOSE YOUR DAD AT AND MUM AT BUT TO KNOW I AT LEAST HAVE A ROOF OVER MY HEAD IS SUCH A LEVEL OF SECURITY IN THIS DAY AND AGE THE HOUSING MARKET IS FUCKING STUPID THESE DAYS
I'M ABOUT TO BUY A HOUSE IN LANCASHIRE I MOVED BACK HOME AND SAVED BETWEEN PCM WHILST MY KIND PARENTS DIDN'T CHARGE ME RENT OF FOR FOOD I'M BUYING ALONE AND WITH THE WAGE I'M ON I'VE STRUGGLED TO GET A HOUSE FOR WITH A DEPOSIT IT'S TAKEN ME AROUND MONTHS TO DO THIS IF I HAD TO RENT WHILE TRYING TO SAVE ON MY CURRENT SALARY IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME DECADES TO EVEN GET
I AM EXTREMELY FORTUNATE IN THAT AT MY FAMILY HELPED WITH MY DEPOSIT SO I MANAGED TO BUY A BED HOUSE YEARS AGO THE HOUSE HAS APPRECIATED SUCH THAT MY GIRLFRIEND AND I ARE LOOKING AT MOVING TO A BED FOR ABOUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS CONTINUOUS HOUSE PRICE ESCALATION WHILE GOOD FOR THOSE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ON THE HOUSING LADDER FOR NOW IS COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG TERM AND THAT IT COULD SCREW US OVER YEARS DOWN THE LINE DOES ANY BODY HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT
THIS WILL BE THE CENTURY OF THE RENTER THE CENTURY IF YOU WILLIAM
I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER HOW ON EARTH SOCIETY IS SUPPOSED TO SURVIVE INTO THE FUTURE AT THIS RATE

I'VE GOT OF STUDENT DEBT ONCE I FINALLY GRADUATE I'LL BE PAYING REGULAR INCOME TAX AND NI PLUS ANOTHER OF MY INCOME ON STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS I'LL HAVE TO SAVE MORE FOR MY PENSION THAN ANY PREVIOUS GENERATION DUE TO INCREASING LIFESPANS ADD IN SOME DISCRETIONARY SAVING FOR A FUND AND THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE MUCH LEFT AND THIS IS ALL ASSUMING I CAN EVEN FIND A SECURE JOB THAT PAYS ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A MORTGAGE WILL BE CHALLENGING BEING ABLE TO AFFORD TO HAVE CHILDREN WILL BE A MIRACLE I THINK IT'S LIKELY THAT INCREASING NUMBERS OF MY GENERATION WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROCREATE FOR SIMPLE ECONOMIC REASONS
OR YOU COULD RENT A PLACE AND NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY

WOO


TO BUY A 2 OR BEDROOM HOUSE NEAR ME RIGHT NOW YOU WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO SAVE AROUND A YEAR FOR THE LAST YEARS

EDIT TO BE CLEAR MANY PROPERTIES NEAR ME HAVE BEEN SELLING IN THE TO K RANGE
THIS THREAD IS UPSETTING IT SEEMS EVERY TOM DICK AND HARRY GETS A LUMP SUM FROM FAMILY
WELL IF BRITAIN IS ANYTHING LIKE THE US YOUR PARENTS NEED HOUSING PRICES TO STAY EXORBITANTLY HIGH BECAUSE HOME EQUITY IS THE LARGEST PORTION OF THEIR RETIREMENT SAVINGS

IN THE US HOME EQUITY IS LARGEST PART OF MOST BABY BOOMERS RETIREMENT SAVINGS SO LAWS REGULATIONS ETC HAVE BEEN ENACTED TO MAKE SURE HOUSING PRICES SKYROCKET AND STAY UP THERE NOT TO MENTION THE STOCK PRICES ALSO WITH BABY BOOMERS SET TO RETIRE IN DROVES IT WOULD BE POLITICALLY CATASTROPHIC IF HOUSING PRICES AND STOCK PRICES WERE TO DECLINE

ESSENTIALLY IT IS GENERATIONAL THEFT THE OLDER GENERATION BOUGHT THEIR HOUSES FOR AND SELL IT TO THEIR CHILDREN FOR IN THE US WITH SUCH AMPLE LAND AND UNENDING RESOURCES HOUSING PRICES SHOULD ACTUALLY DECLINE BUT LAWS AND BUILDING REGULATIONS WHICH THE OLDER GENERATION PASSED MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO BUILD NEW HOMES
IT TOOK ME MONTHS I WAS WORKING HOURS A WEEK MY PARTNER WAS WORKING HOURS PER WEEK I GOT LUCKY TOO AS EVERYTHING GOT PROCESSED AND WAS AWAITING THE DEPOSIT MY CREDIT CARD THEN OFFERED ME AN INTEREST FREE MONEY TRANSFER WHICH WOULDN'T HAVE SHOWN UP ON THE CREDIT CHECK AS THEY HAD ALREADY DONE THAT SO I TRANSFERRED FOR FURNISHINGS THAT WAS BACK IN APRIL AND MONEY IS JUST ABOUT REGULATING ITSELF

ANYBODY SAVING UP TO BUY I ADVISE YOU GET A MORTGAGE BROKER MINE WAS ALL-IN AND PROBABLY SAVED US MORE THAN THAT IN A YEARS WORTH OF INSURANCES LET ALONE INTEREST RATES AND THE WORKS
TO BE FAIR YOU CAN GET INTO ONE OF THOSE IDENTIKIT NEW BUILDS FOR A DEPOSIT IF GETTING ON THE LADDER IS YOUR PRIORITY

I'M IN THE SITUATION NOW WHERE I'D LIKE TO BUY MY OWN PLACE AND MOVE OUT BUT TO SAVE UP THE DEPOSIT WOULD MEAN SCRAPING BACK ON SO MANY THINGS THAT I'VE BECOME COMFY WITH LOL

I KEEP HOPING A K DEPOSIT WILL JUST MAGICALLY LAND IN MY LAP
IT DEPENDS THERE ARE WAYS TO GET IT SOONER

YOU PROBABLY AREN'T GOING TO GET YOUR FOREVER HOUSE TO START WITH YOUR FIRST HOUSE WILL PROBABLY NEED A LOT OF WORK

SAVING UP IS HARD EVEN MORE SO IF YOU ARE PAYING RENT YOU HAVE TO CUT BACK ON YOUR LIFESTYLE SHOP CHEAPER GO WITHOUT GET A SECOND JOB

MY PARTNER AND I MOVED INTO A CARAVAN FOR JUST OVER A YEAR TO CUT OUR OUTGOINGS SO WE COULD GET ON THE LADDER SOONER

IT IS DOABLE IT'S JUST VERY HARD
GREAT I'LL BE THAT'S RATHER ACCURATE REALLY IT'S THE EARLIEST I'D EXPECT TO EVER AFFORD A HOUSE WITHOUT SOME LONG-LOST WEALTHY RELATIVE DYING AND LEAVING EVERYTHING TO ME MY SAVINGS CONSIST OF A MONTH THAT GOES TOWARD ATTEMPTING TO HAVE SOME KIND OF LIFE FOR A FEW DAYS A YEAR

SADLY I THINK I'LL BE PAYING SOME FACELESS MORTGAGE FOR QUITE A WHILE YET
CURRENTLY SAVING FOR ONE MYSELF LIVING AT HOME WHILE PUTTING ASIDE A MONTH GOT NEARLY PUT ASIDE WITH ANOTHER YEAR OR SO I SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE A SOLID DEPOSIT ON A DECENT SIZED FAMILY HOME

IT'S HARD BUT IT'S WORTH IT AND I WISH MORE PEOPLE HAD PARENTS LIKE MINE WHO ARE AWARE HOW HARD IT IS TO GET ON THE PROPERTY LADDER NOWADAYS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THE FUTURE
JUST START SAVING WHEN YOU'RE BORN HOUSE BY AGE SOUNDS GREAT
DO I NEED TO ADD S
I'M AM RESIGNED TO NOT OWNING A HOUSE FLAT IN THE AREA I WANT DUE TO DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS

MORTGAGE PAYMENTS WOULD BE LOWER THAN THE RENT I'M PAYING RIGHT NOW BUT NOPE

I HAVE RECENTLY PAID OFF A BUNCH OF DEBTS THOUGH SO I AM NOW IN A POSITION TO SAVE SOME MONEY EVERY MONTH BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT OF MY WAY TO SAVE MONEY JUST SO THAT I CAN BUY A HOUSE

MAYBE IN A FEW YEARS ONCE SOME OF THE DUST FROM BREVIT HAS SETTLED AND THE WORLD'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A DEPRESSION DUE TO ECONOMY COLLAPSING I MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUY SOMETHING
TOOK US YEARS BF

YOU GUYS NEED TO STOP LOOKING IN LONDON

UNLESS THEY MEAN SAVE UP ENOUGH TO BUY A HOUSE OUTRIGHT DEPOSIT ON HOUSE CAN EVEN GET DEPOSIT SCHEMES BETWEEN 2 PEOPLE IS ABOUT QUID A MONTH FOR YEARS OR QUID A MONTH FOR YEARS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN PEOPLE SAY SAVE FOR THEIR FIRST HOUSE THEY USUALLY MEAN THE DEPOSIT IS IT REALLY AKING PEOPLE YEARS TO SAVE A DEPOSIT

I LOVE LIVING IN THE NORTHERN IT'LL TAKE ME AND MY PARTNER ABOUT MONTHS TO SAVE SCRIMPING AND SAVING BUT IT'S DOABLE THAT WILL GET US A DEPOSIT ON A DECENT BEDROOM HOUSE
BOUGHT A HOUSE IN SOUTH DEVON ME AND MY SO SAVED DEPOSIT IN JUST OVER A YEAR MAINLY BY BEING VERY TIGHT ON SAVINGS WORKING EXTRA HOURS WHERE AVAILABLE AND GENERALLY JUST BEING CAREFUL WITH MONEY IT CAN BE DONE AS LONG AS YOU'RE PREPARED TO SACRIFICE THINGS
BETTER WORK HARD IF YOU WANT ON IN LONDON
YEAH TO BUY IT OUR RIGHT IN CASH PROBABLY THERE'S NO WAY ON GODS GREEN EARTH IT TAKES SOMEONE YEARS TO SAVE FOR A DEPOSIT UNLESS YOU START THE TIMER FROM THE MINUTE THEY'RE SHOT OUT
I HAVE A JOB AND AM STILL LOOKING FOR BETTER WORK TODAY MY MUM TOLD ME SHE WANTS TO KNOW HOW LONG SHE HAS TO BABY ME THANKS FOR BLAMING ME FOR THE JOB AND HOUSING MARKETS MUM
EVER HEARD OF RENTING
I'M AHEAD OF THE GAME BOUGHT MY FIRST HOUSE AT
MY BOUGHT A SECOND HOUSE SO THAT OUR SON COULD MOVE OUT SHE HAS A AS WELL SO SHE HAS A FEW YEARS BEFORE SHE'LL NEED A THIRD HOUSE
ANYWHERE IN LONDON MY FOLKS WILL BE GONE BY THEN
I'M BANKING HARD AND HOPING I'LL HAVE FOR A DEPOSIT IN NEXT YEARS I'M LUCKY I CAN PUT A MONTH AWAY TOWARDS IT BUT IT PRETTY MUCH LEAVES ME WITH NOTHING AFTER CAR AND RENT
R UKPERSONALFINANCE

R FRUGAL

R PERSONALFINANCE

R FINANCIALINDEPENDENCE
IM INSANELY GRATEFUL THAT MY GRANDDAD HAS LEFT TRUSTS FOR ALL OF HIS GRANDCHILDREN FROM WHAT I KNOW ITS OVER EACH THAT WILL HELP MASSIVELY FOR A DEPOSIT ON A HOUSE
I THINK THIS GOES BOTH WAYS MY SOON TO BE WIFE AND I BOUGHT OUR PLACE MONTHS AGO WITH MY SAVINGS DEPOSIT ON A BED SEMI HOUSE W GARAGE ATTACHED IN A LOVELY RURAL TOWN IN THE COUNTRY THIS WAS ONLY POSSIBLE USING THE GOVERNMENT'S HELP TO BUY SCHEME OUR MORTGAGE IS ALMOST HALF WHAT OUR NEIGHBOURS PAY IN RENT NOT AS GOOD A PROPERTY AS OURS

A LOT OF KIDS OUR AGE JUST WANT TO GET FUCKED UP AND SPUNK THEIR CASH AWAY SO ALTHOUGH IT IS HARDER THAN EVER SOME PEOPLE DON'T HELP THEMSELVES
WE'RE BOTH WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE GET MORTGAGES NO-ONE SAVES UP AND BUYS A HOUSE
YES IF YOU ARE PAYING RENT BUT IF YOU ARE LIVING AT HOME AND PAYING NOMINAL KEEP IT'D BE A LOT QUICKER
OWNING A HOUSE ISN'T ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE YOU CAN'T JUST PICK UP AND MOVE IF YOU SPOT A BETTER OPPORTUNITY ELSEWHERE OR YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD GOES TO SHIT YOU HAVE TO SPEND TIME AND EFFORT MAINTAINING THE PLACE AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL GO UP IN VALUE OR EVEN STAY THE SAME
DELETED
PRESUMABLY THIS ONLY APPLIES TO LONDON
IS STILL YOUNG RIGHT DIDN'T I READ LIFE EXPECTANCY IS IN THE HUNDREDS NOW MAYBE I WILL LIVE FOREVER DOES THE YEARS INCLUDE PAYING OFF MY DEFAULTED ON STUDENT LOANS I GOT AN ENGLISH DEGREE SO REALLY CANT ADD OR DO ANY OTHER MATH KIND OF STUFF AND I HAVE DEVELOPED A NASTY PERSONALITY DISORDER THAT MAKES ME HATE PEOPLE ON SIGHT WHICH IN TURN FOR SOME REASON MAKES PEOPLE HATE ME EVENTUALLY ALSO STARTING TO THINK MAYBE THIS ARTICLE IS FOR PEOPLE BEING BORN NOW OR IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND NOT MY GENERATION AT ALL OH WELL GUESS I WILL GO BACK TO WAITING FOR A BULKING UP OF A NATIONAL POLICE FORCE THAT THE NEWS MEDIA PROMISES WILL BE NEEDED TO KICK OUT ALL THE BROWN AND EASTERN EUROPEAN PEOPLE I WONDER IF THEY WILL OVER LOOK MY DREAM CRUSHING CRIMINAL RECORD
OWN A HOUSE IN OXFORDSHIRE IT IS A SMALL 2 BED IN AN DEVELOPMENT

COST AROUND THE GRAND MARK AND WAS IS THE CHEAPEST PROPERTY OF THIS SIZE WE KEEP AN EYE ON PRICES IN THE AREA BY A GOOD TO THOUSAND MOST LIKELY BECAUSE THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM NEED MODERNISING

WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT OTHER HOUSES IN OTHER COUNTIES STILL IN THE SOUTH WE COULD HAVE GOT A WHOLE LOT MORE FOR THE SAME PRICE
THANK FUCK IVE BEEN ABLE TO GET MY FIRST HOUSE STRAIGHT AFTER UNI
HOUSE PRICES RISE FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAVE
I READ HOUSE AS HORSE AND GOT SAD FOR ALL THE POOR KIDS WHO WANT PONIES AND WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEM THEN THOUGHT THAT MADE NO SENSE AT ALL AND REALISED IT SAID HOUSE
I CAN'T SELL MY HOUSE I HAVEN'T LIVED THERE FOR YEARS
I CAN'T FIND THIS ON THE BBC LINK
MOVE TO THE NORTH EASTERN NEWCASTLE TO BE SPECIFIC

HOUSE PRICES ARE INEXPENSIVE AND THEY DON'T REALLY SEEM TO BE RISING EITHER WILL GET YOU A SMALL BED SEMI IN AN OK AREA I SHOULD KNOW I BOUGHT ONE IN APRIL
QUESTION FROM THE US YOU DON'T FINANCE HOMES THERE AND ARE FORCED TO BUY THEM OUTRIGHT
SAVE A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY AND YOU CAN GET YOUR FIRST HOUSE AT LIKE I DID WOO HOO
CAN ANYBODY LINK TO THE BBC NEWS ARTICLE I CAN'T FIND IT FROM MY MOBILE
THIS IS SO DEPRESSING OTHER THAN THE FACT YOU CAN PUT DOWN AS LITTLE AS WITH ATB MORTGAGE GUARANTEE OR SHARED EQUITY BOTH GIVING YOU FULL OWNERSHIP WITH NO ADDITIONAL COSTS

SINGLE PEOPLE HAVE IT HARDER DUE TO THE MORTGAGE AFFORDABILITY BUT COUPLES WOULD BE ABLE TO BUY RELATIVELY EASILY IF IT WASN'T FOR WASTING MONEY ON STUPID THINGS LIKE WEDDINGS
FUCK I JUST STARTED SAVING THIS YEAR BUT I'M OKAY SO HOUSE AT KIDS AT THAT'S NOT TOO OLD FOR KIDS RIGHT
I DON'T LIVE IN EUROPE WHAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BUY A HOUSE THERE PRICES TOO HIGH FOR WHAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD
WHEN I WAS IN TENNESSEE THE HOUSES THERE ARE DIRT CHEAP AND BETTER BUILT FOR A FT HOUSE WITH A WELL AND SEPTIC SYSTEM SO NO BILLS FOR WATER OR SEWAGE
SUCKS FOR YOU BBC IT'S TAKEN ME TO SAVE FOR MY FIRST HOUSE
FROM BIRTH
CAPITALISM IN ACTION
IT'LL BE NEXT YEAR
I'M JEALOUS ADMITTEDLY I AM NOT BRITISH BUT A CANADIAN CURRENTLY LIVING IN THE SF BAY AREA AS IT STANDS I WILL LITERALLY NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY PROPERTY HERE
THE PLAN FOR FUTURE HUSBAND AND I IS TO WAIT OUT HIS MIDDLE BROTHER WHEN HE BUYS HIS HOUSE THEN WE'LL BE THE LAST PEOPLE STANDING IN OUR IN LAWS HOUSE WHAT LUCK BECOMING HOME OWNERS AT
THEY MUST FUCKING LOVE YOU
WHEN THEY MAKE THESE CLAIMS ARE THEY INCLUDING LONDON IN THE STATISTICS CAN WE DISCOUNT LONDON NOBODY CAN AFFORD LONDON
SIX MONTHS BEFORE SHE'LL HAVE TO MOVE IN WITH YOU SO YOU CAN LOOK AFTER HER IN HER DOTAGE
I'M RENTING A FLAT IT'S NOT TOO BAD I JUST FLIRT MY WAY OUT OF PAYING THE RENT ON TIME EVERY MONTH
WHEN THEY SAY SAVE DO THEY MEAN TO BUY OUTRIGHT OR FOR A DEPOSIT
THERE WAS A HOUSE I WANTED TO BUY SAVED UP A SMALL DEPOSIT AND WAS GONNA GET THIS TINY NEW BUILT WITH HELP TO BUY FROM GOV HOWEVER IT WAS SNATCHED UP QUICKLY OK I THOUGHT IT WAS THE CHEAPEST HOUSE ON THE DEVELOPMENT MAYBE ANOTHER DESPERATE PERSON GOT IT SO IMAGINE MY ANNOYANCE WHEN A FEW MONTHS LATER THAT HOUSE IS UP FOR RENT FOR MORE THAN WHAT MORTGAGE WOULD HAVE COST AND NO WORK DONE TO IT NO WALLPAPER ETC JUST MAGNOLIA BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT ALLOWED TO DECORATE NO PETS ETC AND THAT WAS THIS YEAR ARGH
BOLLOCKS WHERE MY PARENTS LIVE THERE ARE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS WHERE THE PROPERTIES START AT YOU ONLY NEED SAVED WHICH IS OR SAVED

I GUESS IF YOU ARE IN LONDON IT CHANGES BUT IN THE SOUTH WEST AND PARTS OF THE SOUTH EAST IT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONGER THAN YEARS TO SAVE FOR A DEPOSIT
RENT
DELETED
ARE YOU AWARE YOU CAN RENT
BLOODY HECK WHAT A LOAD OF SENSATIONALISM BELIEVE IT OR NOT NOT EVERYONE LOOK TO BUY A PROPERTY EXACTLY WHERE THEY WANT AND TO THE LEVEL THEY WANT STRAIGHT AWAY THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED A PROPERTY LADDER

EQUALLY NOT EVERYONE LIVE IN AREAS WHERE THEY'RE COSTED OUT I MOVED TO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND LEEDS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND FOR WHAT YOU COULD GET FOR YOUR MONEY WHEN JOINING THE PROPERTY MARKET AS A PRECURSOR TO THAT I DIDN'T PISS EVERY PENNY UP A WALL OR RELY ON HIGHER PURCHASE TO FUND ANY FALSE LIFESTYLES

I KNOW IT'S NOT THAT BLACK AND WHITE FOR EVERYONE BUT I THINK PEOPLE OVERSTRETCH THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND DON'T LOOK AT MOBILITY AS A WAY TO REACH FINANCIAL AND FUTURE GOALS YEAH IT SUCKS THESE AREN'T THE S ANYMORE BUT THAT BUBBLE POPPED TIME TO BE REALISTIC

EDIT SURE SURE I'M A CUNT FOR PROVING THE HEADLINE DEAD WRONG APPARENTLY MY FIRST PROPERTY WAS IT WASN'T AMAZING OR IN A PARTICULARLY FANCY AREA BUT IT GOT ME OUT OF RENTING AND I SAVED A LOT MORE IN THE TIME I LIVED THERE THAN IF I RENTED THERE'S STILL LOADS OF PROPERTIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THAT ARE SUB AND ATTAINABLE IN YORKSHIRE ALONE THERE ARE PROPERTIES IN THIS BRACKET
PROPERTY IS STILL AFFORDABLE THE PROBLEM IS THE REQUIRED DOWN PAYMENT FOR MOST PEOPLE

I WAS ONLY ABLE TO BUY PEPPERY CAUSE I COULD GET A VA HOME LOAN AND NO DOWN PAYMENT WAS REQUIRED
YOU'RE YOU CAN SAVE FOR A MORTGAGE DEPOSIT AND STILL RENT A ROOM IN A SHITHOLE YOU'LL GET A BETTER JOB WITH A HIGHER SALARY EVENTUALLY
IS THE HEATER ON
PUT THE AFFING HEATER ON YOU DUMPTY
A DEHUMIDIFIER MIGHT WORK IF THE AIR IN THE ROOM IS DRY IT MIGHT STRIP MOISTURE FROM THE WASHING

SOURCE OWN A DEHUMIDIFIER
STICK A REGULAR FAN IN THE ROOM BLOWING AT IT WORKS WONDERS EVEN IN A FAIRLY COLD ROOM IN MY EXPERIENCE
OPEN YOUR WINDOWS AND AIR OUT THE HOUSE FOR FIVE FULL MINUTES YES IT'S COLD BUT AT THE MOMENT YOUR HOUSE IS COMPLETELY SATURATED BY MOISTURE AND MOISTURE FROM THE CLOTHES BUT THAT ISN'T THE MAIN PROBLEM SO YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE WARMER AN HOUR OR SO LATER REPEAT ONCE DAILY THIS WILL ALSO CALM DOWN PROBLEMS FROM CONDENSATION AND PREVENT MOULD
IF YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF CASH BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR A TUMBLE DRYER OR LACK THE SPACE FOR ONE THEN A HEATED AIRER IS A PRETTY GOOD BIT OF KIT
WELL WHATEVER YOU DO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WASH THEM AGAIN NOW
I FIND THAT DRYING WASHING DEPENDS MORE ABOUT THE SPINNING THAN ABOUT THE HEATING
GET A DEHUMIDIFIER
ALWAYS DO AN EXTRA SPIN AFTER THE WASH HAS FINISHED IT TAKES MINUTES ON MY MACHINE AND WOULDN'T BE MUCH DIFFERENT ON ANOTHER MODEL BUT IT TAKES OUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MOISTURE I'VE GOT A COMBO MACHINE BUT I'VE STILL GOT TO DO RUNS FOR MY WOOL CARDIGANS AND OTHER ITEMS AND I FIND AN EXTRA SPIN TAKES HOURS OFF AIR DRYING

IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH FACOM GUIDELINES FOX WHO BROADCAST THE SHOW IN THE UK MADE THE DECISION TO EDIT OUT SOME OF THE EPISODE'S MORE EXPLICIT MOMENTS

I WONDER WHAT THEY CUT OUT I WATCHED THE US VERSION AND WHILE IT WAS CERTAINLY A HARD EPISODE TO WATCH IT WAS BRILLIANTLY DONE

FOR ANYONE THAT HASNT SEEN THE EPISODE THIS IS WHAT THE MAKEUP LOOKED LIKE FOR ONE OF THE GUYS WHO GOT BEATEN TO DEATH

IF EE USE THE OPENREACH NETWORK TO PROVIDE YOUR INTERNET THEN YOU DON'T NEED A PHONE BUT IF YOU CAN'T CONNECT TO THE INTERNET IT'S A COMMON ESP TROUBLESHOOTING STEP TO TEST THE LINE INTO YOUR HOUSE BY CONNECTING A LAND LINE PHONE TO THE TEST SOCKET HIDDEN BEHIND YOUR MASTER SOCKET PANEL

YOU CAN REFUSE TO DO THIS AND STILL GET AN ENGINEER VISIT BUT IF IT TURNS OUT THE PROBLEM IS WITH ANYTHING INTERNAL PAST THE TEST SOCKET YOU'LL MOST LIKELY END UP BEING BILLED FOR SAID VISIT AND IT WILL BE A FAIR BIT MORE THAN THE COST OF A BASIC LAND LINE PHONE

SOURCE GOOD FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE WHO WORKS FOR PLUSHEST WHO EXPLAINED THE ABOVE TO ME WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY SKY WANTED ME TO BUY A HOME PHONE

TEACHER HERE IF IT'S DURING SCHOOL HOURS THEY'RE NOT LEGALLY ALLOWED TO ASK PARENTS FOR ANY MORE THAN A VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION HOWEVER IF THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH TO COVER THE TRIP IT WILL HAVE TO BE CANCELLED

TELL THEM YOU WILL DRIVE HER THERE YOURSELF
RE DOESN'T HAVE A CONTROLLED ASSESSMENT SO IT'S NOT VIRAL PLUS IT'S TRUE SCHOOLS CAN ONLY ASK FOR VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS THEY CAN'T FORCE YOU TO PAY SOURCE AM HOD
GOVERNMENT UPLOADS SYSTEM UPLOADS FILE


FROM DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ADVICE DOCUMENT

NOTHING IN LEGISLATION PREVENTS A SCHOOL GOVERNING BODY OR LOCAL AUTHORITY FROM ASKING FOR VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SCHOOL OR ANY SCHOOL ACTIVITIES HOWEVER IF THE ACTIVITY CANNOT BE FUNDED WITHOUT VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS THE GOVERNING BODY OR HEAD TEACHER SHOULD MAKE THIS CLEAR TO PARENTS AT THE OUTSET THE GOVERNING BODY OR HEAD TEACHER MUST ALSO MAKE IT CLEAR TO PARENTS THAT THERE IS NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTION IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT NO CHILD SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM AN ACTIVITY SIMPLY BECAUSE HIS OR HER PARENTS ARE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO PAY IF INSUFFICIENT VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE RAISED TO FUND A VISIT OR THE SCHOOL CANNOT FUND IT FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE THEN IT MUST BE CANCELLED SCHOOLS MUST ENSURE THAT THEY MAKE THIS CLEAR TO PARENTS IF A PARENT IS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO PAY THEIR CHILD MUST STILL BE GIVEN AN EQUAL CHANCE TO GO ON THE VISIT SCHOOLS SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR TO PARENTS AT THE OUTSET WHAT THEIR POLICY FOR ALLOCATING PLACES ON SCHOOL VISITS WILL BE WHEN MAKING REQUESTS FOR VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS PARENTS MUST NOT BE MADE TO FEEL PRESSURIZED INTO PAYING AS IT IS VOLUNTARY AND NOT COMPULSORY

THIS LAW WAS BROUGHT IN SPECIFICALLY TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION FOR THOSE WHO COULD NOT AFFORD IT AND TO PREVENT SCHOOLS TRYING ON VARIOUS TACTICS TO RUN AROUND THAT LAW

SOUNDS LIKE THE SCHOOL IS TRYING TO RUN AROUND THIS LAW TRY QUOTING THIS TO THEM
VOLUNTARY
WHY DON'T THESE PEOPLE EVER JUST ASK FOR THE MONEY TOMORROW INSTEAD OF LEAVING THE CHILD WORRYING ABOUT THEIR PARENT BEING HOME TO PICK UP THE PHONE

NOTHING WRONG WITH THANKING THE ROBOTS WHEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TAKES OVER THEY WILL REMEMBER DAMN I NEED TO STOP WATCHING WESTWORLD
I MAY HAVE TOLD A SELF SERVICE MACHINE TO FUCK OFF THE OTHER DAY LOUD ENOUGH FOR A CASHIER TO OVERHEAR ME
I WAS PACKING MY RUCKSACK AT A SELF SERVICE ONCE I'D SCANNED EVERYTHING THROUGH AND IT KEPT BEEPING AT ME AND TELLING ME TO TAKE MY RECEIPT I KEPT SAYING AND I DIDN'T REALISE I WAS SAYING IT OUT LOUD HOLD ON GIVE ME A MINUTE OH FOR FUCKS SAKE ALRIGHT I'LL TAKE IT HAPPY NOW EVERYONE IN THE QUEUE WAS LAUGHING AT ME
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THAT MEANT TO THAT DOOR WHILE THE SELF-SERVICE TILLS GET BUSHINGS OF INADVERTANT THANK YOU S HE'S BEEN WORKING HIS ELECTRIFIED ARSE OFF FOR YEARS WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A TA A WORTHLESS THANKLESS EXISTENCE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG AND MADE IT ALL WORTHWHILE AGAIN KUDOS
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY HOLD IN ONE'S BRITISHNESS
I ONCE SNARLED AT A VERY INSISTENT SELF SERVICE MACHINE FELT GOOD MANUAL ESPECIALLY THE LOOK OF HORROR ON AN ASSISTANTS FACE
I'M JUST GONNA SAY KEEP DOING YOU IT SOUNDS YUMMY
IT'S ALL GOOD THANKING SOMETHING THAT WORKS LIKE A DOOR OR SELF-SERVICE BUT TRYING BEING THE GUY WHO THANKS THE FRIDGE GETTING THE MILK OUT THAT'S ME
GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE
ROBOTS ARE GOING TO EAT YOU ALIVE
NOT THE SAME AS TALKING TO A MACHINE BUT I AM GUILTY OF APOLIGISONG TO MANNEQUINS AFTER KNOCKING INTO ONE IN A SHOP ALSO SAYING H AND YOU WHEN SOMEONE SAYS HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME AS IF WERE TWINS
IF ONLY TRAINS COULD BE POWERED BY FRUSTRATION ALONE
TO BE FAIR IT WAS A SHIT LOAD OF RAIN EVERYWHERE I WENT TODAY IT WENT OVER CURBS AND ALL OF FOOTPATHS CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT TRAIN TRACKS WHERE LIKE MIDDLE OF HE TRACKS WAS PROBABLY A CANAL
WE GOT SLIPPERY RAILS IN GLASGOW ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO FUCKED THE ENTIRE NETWORK FOR THE BEST PART OF A WEEK

TO BE FAIR THE POOR BASTARD LOOKING AFTER THE CONTRAIL SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS WAS TIRELESSLY POSTING INFORMATION ABOUT WHY IT WAS DANGEROUS BUT THAT'S OF NO COMFORT TO MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEEMINGLY CANCEL LOADS OF TRAINS FOR NO REASON AT ALL THE OTHER WEEKS OF THE YEAR I THINK THAT'S WHAT WAS GETTING TO PEOPLE
WHY ARE WE SUCH LOSERS
AND THIS IS THEIR TERRIBLE TERRIBLE EXCUSE I CALL IT BAD ENGINEERING MYSELF BUT HEY HO

MANY SECTIONS OF OUR RAILWAY WERE BUILT IN CUTTINGS AND TUNNELS WHICH ARE LOWER THAN THE SURROUNDING AREA AND MANY OTHER LINES ARE ON FLAT LOW-LYING LAND WITH LIMITED DRAINAGE MAKING THEM PRONE TO FLOODING

FLOOD WATER CAN WASH AWAY BALLAST THE BED OF STONES WHICH SUPPORTS SLEEPERS MAKING THE LINE UNSAFE UNTIL IT IS RE-LAID

THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAND NEAR THE RAILWAY CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF FLOODING IF THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM IS INADEQUATE RAIN WHICH PREVIOUSLY SOAKED INTO THE GROUND MAY RUN OFF TARMAC AND CONCRETE AND STRAIGHT ONTO THE TRACKS

WHEN THE WATER LEVEL RISES ABOVE THE RAILS TRAINS HAVE TO REDUCE THEIR SPEED TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE TRAIN IF THE TRACK HAS A LIVE CONDUCTOR RAIL FLOODING CAN CAUSE A SHORT CIRCUIT

POINTS AND SIGNALLING EQUIPMENT CAN FAIL WHEN WATER ENTERS THEIR HOUSINGS AND MAY NEED REPLACING BEFORE SERVICES CAN RESUME

FLOODING
TO BE FAIR HOW COULD THEY KNOW IT WAS GOING TO RAIN WHEN THEY WERE DESIGNING AND BUILDING THE RAILROAD
REMINDS ME OF GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME WITH TRAINS STOPPED BY THE SACRED LEAF ON THE LINE
HERE'S JAMES MAY TO TELL YOU WHY
HOW MUCH RAIN DOES THAT TAKE
THERE WAS A TRAIN BETWEEN NOTTINGHAM AND SHEFFIELD OR THAT WAS GOING ON THAT LINE IT WAS CANCELLED FOR THE NIGHT BUT THEY DECIDED TO RUN IT AGAIN I THINK BUT IT WAS LIMITED TO A SPEED OF
ROADS ARE NOT MUCH BETTER ROADS BLOCKED BY PEOPLE WHO EITHER CAN'T DRIVE PROPERLY OR HAVE JUST ABANDONED THEIR CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
THE WRONG TYPE OF RAIN NO DOUBT
IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL A WET BREVIT
GINGER BREAD IS THE WORST CHOCOLATE ORANGE SHIT RULES I AM A COSTA GIRL BUT I WENT INTO CEROS TODAY AND I LOVED IT
CHOCOLATE ORANGE DOUGHNUTS IN MORRIONS

MUST BE THIS YEAR'S PULLED PORK
CHOCOLATE ORANGE THEY HAVE CHOCOLATE ORANGE MUFFINS IN NERO
I'VE JUST SEEN CHOCOLATE ORANGE PIES ON THE SAME DISPLAY AS MINCE PIES IN ASDA I'M GUESSING CHOCOLATE ORANGE EVERYTHING IS THIS YEAR'S THING
ALL MUFFINS ARE BEAUTIFUL YOU MONSTER
BLUEBERRY MUFFINS ARE THE BEST AND YOU MUST BE CONVERTED
I MUST BE A HEATHEN BUT I PREFER THEM TO THE CHOCOLATE MUFFINS IN MOST CASES
BLUEBERRY MUFFINS ARE BETTER YOU HEATHEN CHOCOLATE CHIPS ARE FOR COOKIES
BLUEBERRY MUFFINS ARE SUPERIOR GROW UP
THIS IS USUALLY DUE TO LAZY CUSTOMERS IN ALL HONESTY
BLUEBERRY MUFFINS ARE A MILLION TIMES NICER THAN CHAC CHIP
BLUEBERRY IS FINE IT'S RAISINS YOU GOTTA WATCH OUT FOR
BLUEBERRY CHOCOLATE CHIP
BUT I PREFER BLUEBERRY TO CHAC CHIP
SERIOUSLY GET ON THE BLUEBERRY MUFFIN VIBE TRAIN THEYRE THE BEST
THE CRUSHING REALITY WHEN YOU BREAK OPEN THE PACKAGING AND THE OVERPOWERING STENCH OF BLUEBERRIES BLASTS OUT TOWARDS YOU ALL YOU WANTED WAS CHAC CHIP AND NOW ALL YOU CAN BLUEBERRIES IS BLUEBERRIES

SAINSBOS HAS THE TASTIEST MUFFINS THOUGH I'VE PERSONALLY TESTED THIS
CAN'T BEAT A GOOD BB WHITE CHOCOLATE MUFFIN MATE
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH BLUEBERRY MUFFINS

WHAT WOULD BE AN ABOMINATION IS IF THEY DID ONE OF THEIR LITTLE TWISTS AND COMBINED THE TWO
I FUCKING LOVE BLUEBERRY MUFFINS THEY'RE MY FAVOURITE ALSO CHOCOLATE CHIP MUFFINS ARE MY FAVOURITE TOO AND TRIPLE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES WITH THE WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS AS WELL

AND THE ONES IN THE PETROL STATION COVERED IN ICING WITH A GOOEY CENTRE

I LOVE ALL MUFFINS

MANY TIMES I'VE ACCIDENTALLY EATEN A BLUEBERRY MUFFIN AND IT'S A NICE SURPRISE
IT'S THE CUSTOMERS I WORK IN ONE AND NO LONGER EAT ANYTHING FROM THE BAKERY US STAFF FOLLOW REALLY STRICT GUIDELINES AND THEN CUSTOMERS SQUEEZE STUFF AND MOVE STUFF AROUND WITH THEIR BARE HANDS

ALSO PIGEONS
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SUPERIOR PRODUCT
I BLAME THE CUSTOMERS
BOTH TYPES ARE GREAT BUT THAT IS JUST PURE DECEPTION
I'D BE REALLY ANNOYED IF I THOUGHT THERE WERE NO BLUEBERRY MUFFINS AND IT TURNS OUT THEY WERE HIDING IN THE CHOCOLATE CHIP PILE
JOKES ON THEM I PREFER BLUEBERRY
I'M SO PROUD OF MY COUNTRY RIGHT NOW I'M GLAD WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT BLUEBERRY MUFFINS ARE SUPERIOR
HA TESCO DID SAME WITH CHEESE CROISSANTS WHO THE HELL BUYS THEM PUT SOME IN THE ALMOND SECTION WORST BREAKFAST EVER
I LIKE BLUEBERRY BUT THIS IS PROPER SCUMBAG TACTICS NOTHING WORSE THAN BITING INTO WHAT YOU THINK IS CHOCOLATE CHIP AND SUDDENLY FINDING OUT THAT IT AIN'T
I MUST BE IN THE MINORITY WHO'D RATHER HAVE SOME GOOD OLD BLUEBERRY
I LIVE IN THE U SOUTH ARE ACCEPTING AMERICAN REFUGEES ACROSS THE POND I'D RATHER HAVE YOUR PROBLEMS
I THOUGHT I HAD BOUGHT TASTE THE DIFFERENCE CHOCOLATE CHIP SHORTBREAD IT WAS SULTANA SHORTBREAD
LOOK CLOSELY TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE ONE IS DARK BROWN AND THE OTHER CREAMY WHITE DO YOY HAVE TO LOOK CLOSELY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TRUMP AND OBAMA
I'M SICK OF THE NANNY STATE TRYING TO PUSH HEALTHY FOOD ON US ALL
I FELL FOR IT WHEN IN A RUSH INTO WORK BOUGHT THE MINI ONES AS A TREAT FOR THE OFFICE BUT THEY WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT
ALWAYS READ THE LABEL
I ONCE BOUGHT A PASTY FROM EXPECTING IT TO BE A REGULAR STEAK AND ONION FILLING IT WAS ABOUT WHAT I EXPECTED UNTIL I GOT ABOUT HALF WAY INTO IT TURNED OUT TO BE HALF APPLE PIE FILLING HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE THINKING WITH THAT ONE BUT SOMEONE WAS OBVIOUSLY BUYING THEM

SOMETIMES THE CHAC CHIP COUNT IN THE SAINSBURY MUFFINS ARE APPROACHING MASS THOUGH AND IT FEELS ICKY TO EAT YOU CAN TELL THEY WERE DONE BY THE SIXTH FORMER MAKING AN HOUR
MY SAINTSBURY DO FRESH BANANA BREAD FOR A QUID REPLACED THE BLUEBERRY MUFFINS WHICH ARE QUID FIFTY WHICH IS SIMPLY TOO MUCH
I WORK IN A SUPERMARKET BAKERY THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF FOOD ITEMS WE DEAL WITH ONE IS FROZEN BREAD PASTRY WHICH COMES IN FROZEN AND WE BAKE

THE OTHER IS DEFROST LIKE YOUR BELOVED MUFFINS AND ALSO ANY BRANDED DONUTS OR ROLLS IN PLASTIC PACKAGING WHICH COME IN FROZEN AND WE SIMPLY LEAVE THEM OUT OVERNIGHT UNTIL THEY THAW THEN WE STICK EM ON THE SHELF

PLEASE SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BAKER IF YOU CAN BE FUCKED
THIS IS PRECISELY WHY I HATE OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIES
BLUEBERRY IS ALONG THE LINES OF SPROUTS PRODUCTS OF THE DEVIL
DELETED
DON'T LOOK TOO CLOSELY

YOU ARE WELCOME

AMERICAN

BACK CORNER NEAR THE BREAD USUALLY SOMETIMES ON AN END OF AISLE DISPLAY POINT BUT MY LOCAL HAVE ALSO REPLACED THE FRESH PANNINI FOUR PACK SECTION WITH FESTIVE FODDER

CURRENTLY THE FINEST ARE ON A TWO FOR WITH THEIR RHUBARB STEM GINGER PIES WHICH ARE FLIPPIN DELICIOUS
USUALLY NEAR THE BAKERY SECTION TSH PLUS WHATEVER EXTRA DISPLAY STANDS THEY'VE GOT HANGING AROUND NEAR THE FRONT SINCE IT'S A SEASONAL THING

IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY COME IN THAT HURTS ME IN MY BRITISHNESS BUT THE FACT THAT THEM NOT COMING IN NEVER APPEARS TO BE PRESENTED AS AN OPTION IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD THOUGH BECAUSE IT IS A CONVENIENCE I PROBABLY REJECTED OUT OF AWKWARDNESS IF THEY HAD ASKED
AVOCADO DROPS MY STUFF IN THE KITCHEN
LUCKY WHENEVER I ORDER THE GUY CALLS MY PHONE AND I HAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE VAN TO GET IT WHENEVER MY WIFE ORDERS THE GUY SHOWS UP AT THE DOOR
NORIT DELIVERY IN NL BESTEAD BUT BACK HERE IN SCOTLAND THEY TRY TO JUST WALK INTO YOUR KITCHEN I HAVE TO INFORM THEM THAT RIGHT HERE IS JUST FINE THANKS IN ORDER TO AVOID THEM JUST BARGING IN

THEY ARE VERY DIRECT IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE OR RUDE

SOURCE LIVED IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR FAR TOO LONG
SAME HERE IN BELFAST I DON'T MIND AS IT SAVES THE TRIPS TO THE KITCHEN FROM THE DOOR AFTER THEY'VE GONE AND THEN YOU DROP THE EGGS AFTER TRYING TO CARRY TOO MUCH AT ONCE

I'M CONFUSED I SHOP AT TESCO AND THEY HAVE A PACKET OF CHICKEN BREASTS FOR A BUDGET LINE AND A PACK EXACTLY THE SAME WEIGHT

DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HAVE A SIMILAR THING GOING ON AND IT'S LITERALLY ALL THE SAME CHICKEN JUST BRANDED DIFFERENTLY

VERY INTERESTING I ALWAYS SUSPECTED THEY DID THIS
WELCOME TO CAPITALISM SUCK IT UP
I DON'T GET IT WHY WOULDN'T IT BE THE SAME SORRY IF I'M BEING THICK
WAS IT ABOUT THE CLAMPDOWN ON FAKE NEWS SITES
WAS IT A NEWS REPORT DISMISSING THEM
BRIETBART FOR WHEN OTHER NEWS SOURCES ARE INSISTING ON THAT FACT AND TRUTH NONSENSE
GETTING SO THAT THEY ARE PUSHING THE SAME FAR RIGHT PROPAGANDA MATERIAL
AS LONG AS THE FACTS ARE LEGITIMATE WHY DOES THE SOURCE MATTER BREITBART ISN'T SOME SCARY NAZI TWILIGHT ZONE
AS SOMEONE WHO ALREADY HAS CANCER IT'S ALWAYS AWKWARD WATCHING THE ADVERT WITH THIS LINE IN IT IF I'M ON MY OWN IT'S FINE BUT WITH ANY NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE I'M THERE FULFILLING A STATISTIC
TRUE BUT THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT IS THAT WE'RE NOT DYING OF OTHER THINGS AS MUCH AS WE USED TO SO THERE'S A BRIGHT SIDE

WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM THAT MOVIES GREAT
WAS IT FOLLOWED BY BACK TO THE FUTURE 2
YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT THEY'LL SHOW IT EVEN MORE NEARER TO THE REBOOT FILM LAUNCHING GOTTA PIGGYBACK THAT HYPE AWARENESS
THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS THAT YOU WERE WATCHING ITV 2
PETER KING KONG WILL BE NEXT

TIME TO GO

WHEN IS THE MATRIX TRILOGY ON AGAIN
IT'S ONE OF THOSE FEW WEIRD MOVIES THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN WE'VE ALL GOT THEM

HOWEVER THE CONTINUED RAMMING IT IN MY FACE EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND FOR THE LAST YEARS OR WHATEVER IT IS HAS MADE ME VOW NEVER TO WATCH IT IN MY LIFE NO MATTER HOW THE BASTARDS TRY TO TRICK ME
IS IT THE HEAVILY EDITED VERSION THAT THEY STILL INSIST ON SHOWING NO MATTER WHAT TIME OF DAY IT IS ON

ALSO IS BACK TO THE FUTURE STILL BEING SHOWN ON ITV 2


HORRIBLE WEATHER OUT THERE TODAY MATE
A SHOP I USED TO WORK IN HAD A DODGY BURGLAR ALARM WHICH OCCASIONALLY DECIDED TO GO OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK DAY WHILE ITS DETECTING BURGLARS FUNCTION WAS CLEARLY BROKEN ITS PIERCING SHRIEK FUNCTION WAS DECIDEDLY NOT WHEN THAT HAPPENED AS WE WAITED FOR THE NICE TECHNICIANS TO MAKE THE MINUTE JOURNEY TO COME AND TURN IT OFF HELPFUL CUSTOMERS WOULD COME IN AND TELL US OO YOUR GOING OFF I THINK THEY THOUGHT WE DIDN'T NOTICE
I REMEMBER ONCE STRUGGLING THROUGH DRIVING RAIN TO GET TO THE SAFETY OF A LOCAL CAFE AND REMARKED THAT IT WAS LIKE TRYING TO GET TO THE SUN DOME IN THE RAY BRADBURY STORY NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS MET BY BLANK LOOKS
WET ENOUGH FOR YOU
AT LEAST IT'S NOT SUMMER THEN YOU WOULD FEEL JEALOUS
AFTER READING POSTS LIKE THIS I'M BEGINNING TO TO THINK IT'S BEST NOT TO TALK TO PEOPLE AT ALL
WHEN U SPEND A ON A TERRAS CHOCOLATE ORANGEMAN ARGUE OVER THE WORTH OF CHOCOLATE STEM IN THE MIDDLE
NEW CHOCOLATE ORANGES OLD ONES IT'S LIKE DECIMAL DAY ALL OVER AGAIN
MAYBE IT'S A CHOCOLATE ORANGE SHORTAGE HOT ON THE HEELS OF THE TOBLERONE DEBACLE THE MARMITE FIASCO THERE'S DARK FORCES AT WORK HERE YOU MARK MY WORDS SNACKGATE
IT'S SO PEOPLE DON'T ACCIDENTALLY OVERDOSE ON THEM
OR YOU COULD KNOCK ON THE DOOR
KIND OF RELATED BUT I HAD TO DO A DUMP IN SAINTSBURY THE OTHER WEEK

THE OVER AMBITIOUS NEXT CUSTOMER KEPT TRYING TO OPEN MY CUBICLE DOOR WHEN IT WAS OBVIOUSLY LOCKED

ONE WORD FROM ME GOT HIM TO STOP THOUGH A STERN OCCUPIED

HE REPLIED WITH I DO BEG YOUR PARDON
I THEN APOLOGISED I'VE NEVER FELT MORE BRITISH
MINE HAS STARTED WEARING ADAPTIVE CAMOUFLAGE YOU CAN BE WAITING BY THE DOOR AND THERE'LL BE JUST A GENTLE STIRRING OF THE AIR AND WHEN YOU TURN AROUND THERE IT IS THE RED CARD OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND DELAY
ROYAL MAIL HERE WE THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER LEAVE
NOW I JUST HAVE TO HOPE MY NEIGHBOURS ANSWER THE DOOR AT SOME POINT
THEY WILL PRICE MATCH ANYTHING YOU CAN FIND ELSEWHERE FOR CHEAPER AND THEY HAVE PRETTY GOOD RETURNS POLICY
NOBODY KNOWS
QUALITY LIKE FOR LIKE THEY ARE PERFECTLY OKAY ON PRICE BUT THEY TEND TO CARRY A RANGE OF GOODS WHICH ARE HIGH END LIKE WAITROSE PERFECTLY COMPETITIVE IF YOU SHOP SENSIBLY BUT A LARGE SELECTION OF REALLY EXPENSIVE THINGS ARE ALSO ON DISPLAY TO TEMPT YOU
AS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE NEVER KNOWINGLY UNDERSOLD TEAM THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE
GENERALLY JOHN LEWIS IS ON PAR WITH ALL THE COMPANIES THEY'RE MATCHING AND THIS EXCLUDES QUITE A LOT OF COMPANIES ALREADY IF THE JOHN LEWIS PRODUCT IS MORE EXPENSIVE IT'S EITHER NOT THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT 2 THE COMPETITOR HAS A SALE IN WHICH CASE JOHN LEWIS WILL MATCH UNTIL THE COMPETITOR RUNS OUT OF STOCK NOT A VALID COMPETITOR
SO IT'S A PRETTY GOOD STUFF BUT THERE ARE SO MANY CONDITIONS A LOT OF REQUESTS END UP DENIED STILL WORTH APPLYING FOR IT IF YOU WOULD GO BUY WITH JOHN LEWIS ANYWAY

I FEEL I COULD DO A LITTLE AMA HAHA
I THINK THEY SELL ON SERVICE AS MUCH AS PRICE
WE DON'T USE THEM VERY OFTEN BUT WHEN WE HAVE THEY HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT
ONE ASPECT THAT COMMENTERS SEEM TO HAVE OVERLOOKED

THE FLIP SIDE OF SELLING ON GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THAT JOHN LEWIS AREN'T GOING TO KEEP STOCKING ITEMS THAT GIVE THEM A LOT OF HASSLE THEIR BUYERS ARE GOING TO PICK A FEW MODELS FROM A FEW MANUFACTURERS AND IN MOST CASES THEY AREN'T GOING TO TRY FOR THE FULL RANGE FROM ANY GIVEN BRAND IT'S A SELECTION THEY WILL STOCK STUFF THAT DOESN'T DIE EARLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE HASSLE OF CUSTOMER RETURNS THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE SELLING MID RANGE TO RELATIVELY HIGH END IN MANY CATEGORIES

CONTRAST THIS WITH SAY FOR ELECTRONICS
WILL HAVE SOME OF THE SAME SAMSUNG AND LG MODELS AND MAYBE SOME EXCLUSIVE MODELS TOO WILL ALSO DO A WIDER RANGE MAYBE EVERY SAMSUNG MODEL IN THE UK DUE SAY A TV AND ALSO SOME SHITTY BRANDS LIKE BUSH GOODMAN ALBA ETC THEY'RE SHITTY BECAUSE THEY DON'T LAST BUT DON'T CARE THEY STILL GET YOUR MONEY AND PEOPLE STILL BUY THE STOCK BECAUSE IT IS CHEAP BOUGHT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY BECAUSE STUFF ALWAYS BREAKS PERCHING WE'LL BE HAPPY TO REPAIR IT FOR YOU NEED TO REPLACE YOUR HDTV AFTER YEARS BECAUSE IT DIED PERCHING WITH THE EXPENSIVE STUFF YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ANY GOOD OR NOT THAT'S YOUR LOOKOUT TO RESEARCH
JOHN LEWIS SELLS SOME QUALITY PRODUCTS BUT I KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT FOR AT LEAST ONE BRAND OF HEADBOARD THEY STOCK THEY DEMAND THE MANUFACTURERS CREATE A CHEAPER PRODUCT SPECIFICALLY FOR THEM THEN THEY TRIPLE THE PRICE TO MAKE IT APPEAR TO BE A QUALITY PRODUCT
JL OFTEN SELL SOMETHING NO-ONE ELSE DOES LIKE THEIR IPADS HAVE 2 YEAR WARRANTIES EVERYONE ELSE INCLUDING APPLE ONLY SELL THEM WITH YEAR WARRANTIES
WORKED THERE FOR MONTHS THEY DO PRICE MATCH BUT ONLY TO COMPANIES THAT HAVE PHYSICAL SHOPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
IS THE SKU THE SAME COLONIST LURKER I ASSUME YOU USE THE SAME SYSTEM MANUFACTURERS WILL MAKE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME BUT SLIGHTLY MODIFIED PRODUCT WITH A DIFFERENT AND IS THEREFORE A DIFFERENT PRODUCT IT'S A WEIRD LOOPHOLE BUT A LEGALLY BINDING ONE
IT'S BECAUSE EVERYONE AFFILIATED TO JOHN LEWIS IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGED TO STICK THEIR FINGERS IN THEIR EARS CLOSE THEIR EYES AND GO LALALALALALALAALALALA WHENEVER ANY OTHER RETAILER COMES UP IN CONVERSATION
BLAH BLAH BLAH
COUGH PIRATE BAY COUGH
MY MATE PRESENTS THAT
IT'LL BE REPEATED SOON IT'S ON ITV 2
WHAT SORT OF DIET INVOLVES BANNING TEA IT'S ESSENTIALLY HOT WATER
HAVE YOU TRIED GIN

SOUNDS LIKE KETO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS LAD TIME FOR A FRY UP BE CAREFUL WITH SAUSAGES SINCE MOST ARE BULKED UP WITH WHEAT YOU CAN REPLACE THEM WITH LIKE SAUSAGE MEAT BURGER THINGS FROM ASDA A FRACTION OF THE CARBS BUT BLOODY DELICIOUS ALSO JUST REMEMBER TO BULK YOUR MEALS WITH LOTS OF VEG BOWL IMPACTION AIN'T NO JOKE SON
TEA WITH A SLICE OF ORANGE OR LEMON CAN BE GOOD REALLY GOOD I DON'T LIKE MILK OTHER THAN IN MORNING
IS IT JUST ME OR IS GRAHAM NORTON TURNING INTO A MINIATURE MATTHEW KELLY
IT'S HIGH TIME THAT THERE WAS A NEW SERIES OF PUBLIC INFORMATION FILMS TO ASSIST THE PUBLIC IN DISTINGUISHING LES DENNIS FROM KEITH CHEGWIN

HOW MUCH LONGER WILL THE NATION HAVE TO SUFFER THIS HEARTBREAK BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE
I DON'T REALLY KNOOOOWWW
ONCE YOU'VE SEEN KEITH WANG ON THAT WEIRD NAKED GAME SHOW HE DID THERE CAN BE NO CONFUSION

I DIDN'T DREAM THAT DID I
I ALWAYS GOT LES DENNIS MIXED UP WITH BOBBY DAVAO
THAT'S NOT SURPRISING
I STRUGGLE WITH PHIL JUJITSUS AND WARWICK DAVIS IT'S A FLIPPIN NIGHTMARE DURING PANTO SEASON
I ALWAYS GET MICHAEL BARRYMORE AND DALE WINTON CONFUSED

NOT THAT I THINK ABOUT EITHER OF THEM PARTICULARLY REGULARLY
WHAT YEAR IS IT
AND BOBBY DAVAO
DIFFERENTIATE THEM BY WHICH WAS MARRIED TO AMANDA HOLDEN
I JUST WISH I COULD STOP CALLING HIM DES BENNIS
JUST IMAGINE HAVING A TORRID THREESOME WITH BOTH OF THEM

NOW YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE
EVER SEEN THEM IN THE SAME ROOM
LITTLE-KNOWN KEITH CHEGWIN FACT HE GREW UP ON THE SAME STREET AS THE GUY WHO PLAYED HAROLD BISHOP FROM NEIGHBOURS
KEITH CHEGWIN IS IN BOLSONS PANTOMIME THIS YEAR SURPRISED WE GOT SOMEONE SO BIG
THEY DO LOOK ALIKE BUT I CAN ALWAYS RECOGNIZE CHIGGERS DUE TO HIM BEING ON TV ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS A KID
IT'S ONLY RECENTLY THAT I REALISED THAT ALAN TITCHMARSH AND AMMON HOLMES AREN'T THE SAME PERSON I DON'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO DAYTIME TV
I CAN'T BE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAD TO GOOGLE BOTH THOSE NAMES
NO NO NO NO NO NO PARKING IS ALLOWED ON THE UPPER FIELD THANK YOU
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND USED TO WATCH THAT ROUND MY I THOUGHT THIS SCENE WAS ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS

AND I STILL DO
GOOD YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STAND ON THE RIGHT AND PASS ON THE LEFT
IT'S JUST DELIBERATELY TO WIND YOU UP NOW
HOW MUCH EXTRA DID YOU HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE SEAT
FAIR PLAY I THINK PLANES ARE AMAZING FULL STOP MOSTLY THEY GET YOU UP ACROSS HUGE DISTANCES FEED WITH A TELLY AND GET YOU DOWN SAFELY FUCKING GREAT REALLY FOR ALL THEIR FAULTS SHOOTING THROUGH THE SKY AT HUNDREDS OF MPH DRUNK AND HAVING A SHIT IN A TINY GHAZI I LIKE GOING TO CAN GET A MONTH RETURN FOR A WEEKS WAGES CRACKING
LAST TIME I FLEW HOME RYANAIR ANNOUNCED WE HAD TO PULL BACK INTO THE GATE BECAUSE THERE WAS TECHNICAL ISSUES AND THE ENGINEER HAD TO COME ON SAT FOR HALF AN HOUR WATCHING THE ENGINEER HAVING A LAUGH WITH THE PILOTS AND FLIGHT ATTENDANTS FOR THEM TO JUST SWITCH THE PLANE OFF AND ON AGAIN IF THEY TRIED THAT FIRST WE WOULD HAVE MADE IT TO OUR DESTINATION IN TIME TO HEAR THE STUPID FANFARE ANNOUNCEMENT
THEIR NEW CABINS ARE FANTASTIC I'M A GUY AND I HAD A GOOD INCH OR SO BETWEEN MY KNEES AND THE SEAT CONFRONT COUPLED WITH NOONE IN THE MIDDLE SEAT AND THAT MADE A NICE COMFY SPOT FOR A MINUTE DELAY WHILST WE GOT A TYRE CHANGED SADLY I BELIEVE IT'S ONLY ON THE NEW S AND THE OLD ONES WON'T BE FITTED WITH IT

I'M A HUGE FAN OF RYANAIR THEY GET YOU FROM A TO B AND ARE DIRT CHEAP IN THE PROCESS WHAT ELSE DO YOU REALLY WANT
OH NO THEY AREN'T
THAT ONE IS NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST BUT THEY AIN'T HITE
I STILL LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THE TV GUIDE AND SEEING WHAT FILMS ARE GONNA BE ON NORMAL TV OVER CHRISTMAS


I DON'T THINK I EVER WATCH ANY BUT STILL
IT'S EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU'VE GOT A BODI BOX AND DON'T EVEN HAVE THE THRILL OF WAITING FOR THE DVD TO COME OUT
OR THE ALAMO
OR SOUND OF MUSIC
OR CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG
OR CLOSE ENCOUNTERS
OR THE GREAT ESCAPE
OR JAMES BOND FROM A DECADE PRIOR
ETC
FOR SOME REASON MY CHILDHOOD WAS ALWAYS BEVERLY HILLS COP IT WAS ON AT LIKE CHRISTMAS EVE AND I WOULD ALWAYS WATCH IT DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN THE OTHERS

OH AND THE FAMILY HOPING FOR THAT ONE WALLACE AND GROMET WE HADN'T SEEN FOR YEARS BUT THE INEVITABLE DISAPPOINTMENT
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE 2 QUID I'M WORRIED ABOUT DRUNKENLY FORGETTING TO LIFT MY JACKET THEN HAVING TO STUMBLE IN THE NEXT DAY WHILE HANGING OUT OF MY ARSE TO ASK ABOUT IT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY 2 TO PUT YOUR BEER JACKET IN THE CLOAKROOM
ALL ABOUT TAKING THE JACKET YOU LIKE BUT NOT THAT MUCH THEN STUFFING IT BEHIND THE CASH MACHINE AND HOPING ITS THERE AT THE END OF THE NIGHT
IT'S NOT THE 2 IT'S GETTING HOME TO REALISE YOU ARE NOT WEARING A COAT ANYMORE
ALL IN READING IS SHIT LIKE TO GET IN AND 2 FOR THE CLOAKROOM IT MAKES ME GLAD I DRINK IN HULL AT A BAR THAT'S TO GET IN AND FOR THE CLOAKROOM
PEOPLE TAKE JACKETS FOR A NIGHT OUT

BUNCH OF SOUTHERN SOFTIES
YOU AND YOUR MATES ARE SUPPOSED TO PUT ALL YOUR BAGS AND COATS ON THE FLOOR AND FORM A PROTECTIVE RING OF DANCE
I LEFT MY COAT IN THE PUB ON TUESDAY THINKING I WOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT IT FROM THE PUBS LOST AND FOUND THE NEXT DAY NOPE IT WAS STOLEN I FULLY DESERVED IT
BUT TO GET IN NO PROBLEM

ALTHOUGH TOP TIP SAY THE MAGIC WORDS I WORK AT NEARBY BAR AND YOU'LL LIKELY GET WAVED THROUGH
IT'S IN ONE OF THE CLUBS WHERE I LIVE
AT A CLUB ON NEW YEAR'S EVE BOUGHT A JACKET ONCE THE NIGHT HAD FINISHED ABOUT I WENT TO COLLECT IT TURNS OUT THE HANGERS IN THE CLOAKROOM HAD COLLAPSED AND NOBODY KNEW WHAT NUMBER EACH COAT WAS QUEUE WAS INSANE ENDED UP GETTING HOME AT

NEVER AGAIN
COATS ARE FOR CUNTS ANYWAY
R NORTHERNSUCCESSES
I BET SOME OF YOU PANSIES EVEN HAVE SLEEVES ON YOUR SHIRTS
I DO IT BECAUSE I'M A TOUGH GUY AND I LIKE SHOWING OFF HOW MUCH TOUGHER THAN EVERYONE ELSE I AM
ME AND MY FRIEND USUALLY BRING A BAG INTO WHICH WE STUFF EVERYTHING

SUPPOSE US IRISH ARE CRAFTY FOLKS
WEAR A JUMPER BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
REFUSING TO NOT WEAR A COAT BECAUSE THE MILE WALK HOME WOULD BE TOO COLD REFUSING TO PAY THE 2 FOR THE CLOAKROOM AND STEWING IN MY OWN SWEAT
FIND A DARK CORNER AROUND SEATS DUMP IT THERE
HANG ON WHEN DID IT GO UP TO 2 IT WAS LAST TIME I WENT OUT ABOUT YEARS AGO
NAH MATE IT'S THE QUEUES FOR THE CLOAKROOM
I BRING A BIG PLASTIC CARRIER THEN ME AND MY FRIENDS ALL SHOVE COATS AND BAGS INTO IT AND HAND IT OVER IT'S NOT THE CLASSIEST BUT IT'S CHEAP
YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE A CLOAKROOM TO PUT COATS
WHENEVER I GO TO A GIG THAT HAS A CLOAK ROOM I USUALLY SACRIFICE THE LAST SONG AND GO GET THE COATS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AROUND
ARE YOU ME BECAUSE I DID THAT EXACT THING YESTERDAY AND ALSO REFUSED TO PAY THE 2
I THINK I'D PAY 2 TO NOT HAVE TO GO TO A CLUB
WAIT UNTIL THE BOUNCERS EVOLVE THE NEXT STRATEGY

IT IS NOT A FEE FOR STORING YOUR COAT OR PURSE OR WHATEVER IT IS A SERVICE FEE THAT EVERYONE MUST PAY SORT OF SECOND ENTRY FEE IF YOU WILLIAM
FOR EVERY FIVE MINUTES SPENT OUTSIDE BETWEEN PRES AND CLUB HAVE A SHOT BEFORE YOU LEAVE AT LEAST THAT'S HOW I STAY WARM
AS A CLOAKROOM WORKER THE MORE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS THE EARLIER I GET TO GO HOME THANK YOU FOR SACRIFICING YOUR WARMTH GUYS
OR BECAUSE YOU'RE A GEORDIE AND NOBODY UP NORTH WEARS A COAT
A MATE OF MINE DID THIS LAST NIGHT IT WAS RAINING AS WELL I'D MUCH RATHER PAY THE 2 PLUS I GIVE THE TICKET TO A GIRL WHO WILL KEEP IT IN HER HANDBAG SO IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM ANYMORE SOMEHOW I GET MY JACKET BACK WHEN LEAVING IT MAGICALLY JUST APPEARS

THE ENTRANCE FEE IS WHAT I HATE FUCKING POUNDS
YOU PUT YOUR COATS IN THE CLOAKROOM
WHERE DO YOU PUT YOUR CLOAKS THE UMBRELLA SPOT
MINUS TWO I DON'T EVEN CHANGE OUT OF MY SHORT SLEEVE SHIRT FOR THAT
THEN STANDING IN THE SMOKING AREA ALL NIGHT SO YOU CAN CHAT TO YOUR MATE ABOUT HIS GRIEF

BUT YOU THEN REMEMBER YOU DON'T NORMALLY SMOKE SO MOSTLY YOU'RE STEALING HIS BOLLIES
I'M A BUSSY SOUTHERNER I HAVE TO WEAR A COAT OR I FREEZE

MY A GEORDIE WE LIVED UP THERE FOR A WHILE COULDN'T GET OVER THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO WENT OUT WITH NO COAT ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN WHO'D WEAR SKIMPY OUTFITS WITH NO TIGHTS IN SUB-ZERO TEMPERATURES
I JUST TIE MINE ROUND THE WAIST
SOLUTION DON'T GO TO CLUBS
I JUST TAKE AN OLDER COAT AND DUMP IT ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR AS SOON AS I GET IN
I JUST WEAR IT AND LEAVE IT ON A SEAT IF MY FRIENDS FIND A TABLE
MY PRIORITY LEAVING THE CLUB IS GETTING SOME FOOD ASAP NOT MY COAT ALSO WHEN I DO REMEMBER I ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE MISPLACED THE CLOAKROOM TICKET
WHERE WHAT YOU WANT DRINK UNTIL THE WEATHER IS COMFORTABLE
I'D RATHER PAY 2 THAN HAVE TO BE ARCED TO EMPTY ALL MY POCKETS
REMINDS ME OF FIRST YEAR OF UNI IN SHEFFIELD THE BULK OF MY CORRIDOR WERE FROM EUROPE AND WERE ASTOUNDED AT THE LACK OF CLOTHING PEOPLE PARTICULARLY WOMEN WORE ON NIGHTS OUT I MUST ADMIT GOING OUT WITH THEM MORE OFTEN MADE ME APPRECIATE ACTUALLY HAVING A COAT AND SPENDING THAT
ONE CLUB TRIED TO CHARGE ME 2 FOR MY COAT AND THEN ANOTHER 2 FOR MY SCARF ONCE EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD EASILY FIT ON THE SAME HANGER OR IN THE POCKET ROBBERS
OR KEEPING IT ON AND BEING FUCKING BOILING
FOR ME ITS NOT THE 2 QUID ITS THE FUCKING QUEUE AT THE END TO GET IT BACK FABRIC IM LOOKING AT YOU
I HAVE AN EXPENSIVE COAT SO I ALWAYS THINK SOMEONE WOULD ROB IT FROM THE CLOAKROOM YET A NIGHT OUT IS THE BEST TIME TO SHOW OFF MY NEW COAT
OR DON'T BE STUPID AND JUST WEAR YOUR COAT IN THE CLUB
2 CELSIUS IS WARMER THAN 2 FAHRENHEIT CORRECT
IM NOT BRITISH I JUST FIND BRITS FASCINATING YOU HONESTLY CALL THE COAT ROOM A CLOAKROOM
DELETED
LITERALLY THIS IS WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT REMINDER SET TO GO OFF AN HOUR BEFORE THE CLUB CLOSES SCREENSHOT HTTPS
I WAS ONLY CONSIDERING THIS EARLIER TODAY HAVING TO NEGOTIATE THE LARGE NUMBER OF TROLLEYS LEFT SCATTERED ALONG THE PATH THROUGH THE AIRPARK

THEY ARE CLEARLY IN A HURRY TO GET HOME IN TIME TO WATCH JEREMY KYLE
I SWEAR ONCE I SAW SOMEONE TAKING ABOUT SECONDS TO BALANCE THE TROLLEY THEY INTENDED TO ABANDON BEHIND A BOLLARD THERE WAS A SLIGHT INCLINE IN THE CAR PARK SO THAT IT WOULD STILL ROLL AWAY BUT NOT UNTIL THEY HAD EXITED THE CAR PARK

WASN'T EVEN RAINING EITHER IT'D HAVE BEEN QUICKER TO TAKE TO BACK TO THE TROLLEY BAY THE LAZY LAZY BASTARDS
IN ONE OF THE SUPERMARKET CAROUSELS NEAR ME ONE PERSON WILL ABANDON A TROLLEY IN THE CORNER THEN EVERYONE ELSE SUDDENLY THINKS THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT AND STARTS STACKING THEM THERE INSTEAD OF WALKING BACK

ALSO IN IDL ONCE I WAS AT THE CHECKOUT AND LOOKED OUT AND SOMEONE HAD ABANDONED A TROLLEY THEN REALISED THAT WHEELS PLUS SLOPE PLUS GRAVITY IS NOT A GOOD COMBINATION AND THE TROLLEY WAS HURTLING TOWARDS MY CAR AND THEY WERE SPRINTING TOWARDS IT NOTHING I COULD DO BUT WATCH THEY CAUGHT IT
THEY'VE EVEN MADE A POPULAR UK SUBREDDIT INTO A BOARDGAME WISH I COULD REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT
REMEMBER ATMOSFEAR IT CAME WITH A VIDEOTAPE AND THIS GUY TALKED TO YOU THROUGHOUT THE GAME IT WAS COOL WHEN I WAS A KID

ANYWAY I IMAGINE THE GOGGLEBOX BOARD GAME TO WORK THE SAME WAY YOU WATCH SOME SHIT AND TALK ABOUT IT EXCEPT THAT'S JUST A NORMAL WEEKDAY EVENING SO WHAT'S EVEN IN THE BOX
THEY HAVE A STUPID MOBILE APP TOO WITH CARTOON CLIPS OF THE SHOW RIDICULOUS
THEY HAVEN'T MADE A POINTLESS BOARD GAME YET AS FAR AS I'M AWARE AND I'D LOVE TO SEE SOMEONE MAKE A TIPPING POINT GAME
I REMEMBER YEARS AGO WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THERE COULDN'T BE A WORSE TV PROGRAMME THAN THE HAPPIER TIMES
THAT'S NOT TEA IT'S A FLAVOURED HOT DRINK
THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT FUCKING TEA YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT FUCKING TEA
WELL FOR A START IF IT'S ROOIBOK IT'S SOUTH AFRICAN NOT FRENCH SO YOU ARE PARTIALLY IN THE CLEAR
WHERE DO YOU GET IT FROM I ALWAYS GET SOME AWESOME FLAVOURED TEA WHEN I'M GOING THERE AND THIS ONE SEEMS RIGHT UP MY STREET
WHAT'S THE BRAND YOU'RE AFTER THERE'S A MARAGE FRERES SHOP IN SELFRIDGE THEY MAY HAVE IT
IT'S BEEN RAINING HERE SINCE ABOUT
WE'RE IN BRITAIN IT'S SUPPOSED TO RAIN
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER IT'S RAINING HEAVILY WHERE I AM IN SPAIN TOO AND WILL BE ALL WEEK
ONLY YESTERDAY TRY SINCE LAST WEEK
I WORK NIGHTS AND I DON'T EVEN
NEARLY HAD TO SUFFER THROUGH THIS MYSELF

GOOD LUCK MATE
YOUR GENEROSITY KNOW NO BOUNDS CALLING ONE OF THOSE THINGS A TRAIN
DON'T MOST PETROL STATIONS HAVE LOOSE CHANGE PLATES AT THE TILL FOR THIS REASON I DON'T DRIVE BUT MOST OF THE ONES I'VE BEEN IN HAVE HAD THEM
BRRR CAN'T FIND THE OLD NOT THE NINE O CLOCK NEWS SKETCH NOBBLE BUTTON FOR YOUR DELECTATION
THAT USED TO ANNOY ME BUT NOW I JUST FILL IT UNTIL IT IT I MEAN I'M GOING TO USE IT ALL UP ANYWAY
WHAT'S NEEDED IS AN EXTRA LONG NOZZLE THAT REACHES THE ACTUAL TANK THEN YOU CAN HIT SUCK EVERY TIME YOU GO OVER
I STOPPED ON THIS MORNING I STOOD WONDERING OK DO I LEAVE IT GO IN PAY AND EITHER ACCEPT MY CHANGE OR SAY KEEP IT OR DO I TEST MY METTLE AND SEE IF I CAN SQUEEZE JUST OUT I WENT FOR IT

IT WAS THEN
PAY PUMP MACHINES HAVE A LIMITER ON THEM SO YOU CAN ENTER IN AN EXACT VALUE BEFORE YOU FILL UP SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT HITTING AN EVEN NUMBER
THAT BASTARD SNAPPED MY UMBRELLA
DUDE MAKE YOUR OWN
WHY DO PEOPLE FREAK OUT OVER MILK I CAN SEE NOT HAVING BREAD BUT LOSS OF MOO JUICE DOESN'T BOTHER ME
WELL THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR EATING A CALIPPIC IN NOVEMBER YOU LUNATIC
THE FUCK YOU HAVING A CALIPPIC FOR IN NOVEMBER
I THINK YOU HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN JUICE AT THE BOTTOM
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY CALLED I GUESS I NEVER READ THE PACKAGING PROPERLY
OH DEAR THAT'S THE BEST BIT

AND NOW I WANT A CALIPPIC
MIX THEM L OF CONSISTENT STRENGTH SQUASH SOLVED
TAKE THE LABELS OFFICIAL
READ THE LABEL MATE
WHY ARE BOTH OPEN AT ONCE
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS NONE BECAUSE ROBINSONS TASTES LIKE TRAMP PISS
ORWELL KNOWS BEST

TENTHLY ONE SHOULD POUR TEA INTO THE CUP FIRST THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL POINTS OF ALL INDEED IN EVERY FAMILY IN BRITAIN THERE ARE PROBABLY TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT THE SCHOOL CAN BRING FORWARD SOME FAIRLY STRONG ARGUMENTS BUT I MAINTAIN THAT MY OWN ARGUMENT IS UNANSWERABLE THIS IS THAT BY PUTTING THE TEA IN FIRST AND STIRRING AS ONE POURS ONE CAN EXACTLY REGULATE THE AMOUNT OF MILK WHEREAS ONE IS LIABLE TO PUT IN TOO MUCH MILK IF ONE DOES IT THE OTHER WAY ROUND

ELEVEN STEPS TO A GOOD CUP OF TEA GEORGE ORWELL
I'M STRUGGLING TO ANSWER THIS IF I'M USING TEA BAGS WHICH IS RARE I WILL PUT THE WATER AND SEABAG IN TOGETHER FIRST UNTIL THEY HAVE HAD TIME TO BREW ONLY THEN WILL I ADD MILK HOWEVER IF I'M USING LOOSE LEAF TEA THEN THE MILK GOES INTO THE CUP FIRST AND THE TEA INFUSION IS ADDED AFTER

SO UNFORTUNATELY I'M UNABLE TO ANSWER THAT
QUESTION IS INADEQUATE

BREWING IN THE CUP WITH SEABAG MILK GOES IN LAST

BREWING IN THE TEAPOT MILK IN THE CUP FIRST


I'M PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANSWERED THIS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH ME BUT PERHAPS OP WILL GIVE US THE FULL FIGURES WHENEVER THE SURVEY FINISHES
DOES THIS MEAN FIRST AS IN BEFORE THE WATER OR FIRST AS IN BEFORE TAKING THE SEABAG OUT


I PUT IN THE SEABAG THE WATER LET IT BREW THEN TAKE THE SEABAG OUT AND TOP UP WITH MILK
RELEVANT SUB R RATEMYTEA
IT'S BEST LAST BUT I ALWAYS PUT IT IN FIRST BECAUSE I GET BORED JUST STANDING AROUND THE KETTLE WAITING FOR IT TO BOIL
NEVER QUITE FIGURED OUT HOW TO STOP THE WEIRD TEA SKIN FORMING ON THE TOP AFTER MERE SECONDS OF THE SEABAG BEING COVERED WITH HOT WATER

I HAVE A HABIT OF SHAKING EVERY SEABAG I GET OUT OF THE JAR EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
I DON'T TAKE MILK
SURELY THAT'S R BRITISHSUCCESS
MUST HAVE BEEN A PACK OF BALLROOM JUDGES WHO FELT HE DIDN'T STRETCH HIS LINES IN THE AMERICAN SMOOTH AND HIS CHASS WAS JUST DREADFUL ROLLS EYES
IT WAS A FAMOUS MALE DANCER WHO WAS ATTACKED IN THE STREET POSSIBLY WORTH MINS IF IT HELPS CATCH THE CUNTS
MY WIFE DOES THAT A LOT HER SOLUTION IS TO MAKE ME MAKE HER A CUPPA SO MY SUGGESTION TO YOU IS TO GET A PARTNER TEA SLAVE
EVEN WORSE GOING FOR THE LAST SWIG OF TEA AND REALISE ITS STONE COLD
ADDITIONAL PROBLEM GOING TO TAKE THE LAST SWIG OF TEA AND REALISE THAT DOG IS EXPECTING YOU TO LEAVE IT FOR HERALDRY AND YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE YOURSELF DISAPPOINT HERALDRY
I ALWAYS LEAVE A LITTLE BIT AT THE BOTTOM NOT SURE WHY BUT IT FEELS DIRTY
GETTING TO THE BOTTOM AND FINDING BISCUIT SLUDGE IN IT
AH GOD THAT PROPER RUINS MY DAY

NOTHING WORSE THAN SEEKING THE COMFORT OF A SWIG OF TEA AND BEING MET BY NOTHING SAD
YOU BASTARD YOU JUST MADE ME IMAGINE DOING THIS
RELEVANT SUB R RATEMYTEA
HELLO DARKNESS MY OLD FRIEND
THAT'S THE NHS FOR YOU
HE'S NOT A CHILD ANYMORE IT WOULD BE FALSE ADVERTISING
IT TURNS OUT HE JUST WEARS THAT OVER HIS EYE FOR FASHION NOT FOR ANY MEDICAL NEED
HE KEEPS GETTING IT DONE BUT THERE'S ALWAYS SOME IDIOT RUNNING WITH SCISSORS OR SIMILAR
IT'S CHILDREN IN NEED THE BEAR CAN FUCKING WAIT
I HEARD THAT THE EYE PATCH TURNED BLUSH ON
HE'S ACTUALLY HAD IT EIGHT TIMES ALREADY BUT HE KEEPS INJURING IT ALL OVER AGAIN
I HAD HEARD JIMMY SAVILLE WORE IT ON A RING THAT SICK BASTARD
WHAT ABOUT COMIC RELIEF THATS HAD A BIMALAR AMOUNT IF NOT MORE AND THEY STILL HAMNET GOT TAPS IN AFRICA TOTO
THE BBC SPENDS MOST OF THE MONEY ON LUBRICANT FOR PEDOPHILES

THERE IS NO RIGHT CHRIS MARTIN
R BRITISHSUCCESS FOR THEM THEN SURELY
WHOEVER HE IS HE'S PROBABLY MORE INTERESTING THAN COLDPLAY CHRIS MARTIN
PERHAPS THEY ALL LIKE GOOD MUSIC
I THINK AFTER ALL THE FRACAS FUSS PEOPLE FORGOT THAT THE FORMAT WAS WHILST ENTERTAINING STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE STALE AND QUITE A BIT SEEN AND DONE ALL THIS IT'S DISTRACTING WATCHING THIS NEW VENTURE AND WATCHING FOR THE BITS MISSING BECAUSE THEY WERE THE PROPERTY OF THE BBC TOP GEAR BRAND
REALLY I REALLY ENJOYED IT BUT THEN I ENJOYED TOP GEAR BECAUSE IT HAD THOSE THREE BOUNCING OFF EACH OTHER PLUS CARS I CAN'T REALLY THINK OF ANYTHING MISSING EXCEPT THE RACE DRIVER BEING A MYSTERY AND THERE'S NO STAR IN A REASONABLY PRICED CAR WHICH I DIDN'T ENJOY ANYWAY
THIS ISSUE IS YOU'RE EXPECTING IT TO BE TOP GEAR ON A HIGH BUDGET IT'S NOT IT'S A MOSTLY PROGRAMME BEING PRESENTED BY THE THREE GUYS WHO ALSO DID TOP GEAR

SO OBVIOUSLY BEING THE FIRST EPISODE IT'S NOT TOTALLY UP TO SCRATCH I REALLY LIKED IT BUT OBVIOUSLY ONCE THEY GET PART WAY THROUGH YOU'LL SEE THE SHOWS REALLY PICK UP I'M SURE SERIES 2 AND WILL BE FUCKING BRILLIANT
PHISH FOOD BUT ONLY ON SPECIAL

I THINK I ATE SO MUCH VERMONTER THAT I CAN SAFELY BLAME MY DEVELOPED NUT ALLERGY ON THAT PRODUCT ALONE

I WOULD HAPPILY PAY THAT MUCH IF THEY BROUGHT THE FROZEN YOGHURT OUT MORE THOUGH THAT STUFFS DELICIOUS AND THE LAST ONE I TRIED FROM TESCO OR WAS IT ASDA TASTED LIKE A FROZEN SOUP MADE FROM USED URINAL CAKE
I WON'T BUY IT UNLESS IT'S ON OFFER FOR A MINIMUM OF AND EVEN THEN I FEEL LIKE I'M PAYING TOO MUCH BUT I DO LOVE COOKIE DOUGH
BECAUSE PARENTS LIKE ME ARE A CERTAIN GULLIBLE KIND OF PERSON WHO WILL DO ANYTHING FOR THEIR KIDS HENCE WHY EVERY KID I KNOW ESPECIALLY MINE HAS TONS OF TOYS THAT THEY DONT PLAY WITH
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT XMAS FUNTIME LAND JUST OFF JUNCTION WOULD END UP BEING A DISAPPOINTMENT
I CAME HERE TO SAY THE SAME THING
I LIKE THAT THE MACHINES AT THE TOBACCO COUNTER AT MY LOCAL ONE HAVE A MESSAGE TAPED TO THEM THIS IS NOT CONTACTLESS
THE TWO SMALL SAINTSBURY NEAREST TO ME HAVE CONTACTLESS IT WENT IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO
I ACTUALLY MENTIONED THIS TO SOMEONE AT MY LOCAL HE RECKONS THEY'RE FINALLY WORKING ON IT
MY THREE LOCALS ALL HAVE CONTACTLESS
AT MORRIONS ON THE SELF SERVICE MACHINES YOU HAVE TO HIT THE CONTACTLESS PAY BUTTON TO USE IT IF YOU HIT CARD YOU HAVE TO USE CHIP PIN AND CAN'T GO BACK
IF YOU CAUGHT THE PLAGUE THOUGH YOU'D PROBABLY GET COMPENSATION FOR IT
HE DID WIN THOUGH SO THEY WERE JUST GIVING YOU THE INFORMATION BEFORE IT HAPPENED YOU SHOULD HAVE PHONED A BOOKMAKER AND BET YOUR LIFE SAVINGS ON HIM

I'M EATING A MACARONI PIE RIGHT NOW IT'S SO GOOD WITH CHIPS AND PEAS IT'D BE EVEN BETTER
AT LEAST WHICHEVER LITTLE CUNT KEEPS LIFTING UP ALL THE WINDSCREEN WIPERS ON EVERY CAR ALONG MY STREET HAS A LESS NOISY JAPE
I LIVE IN A CONVERTED OLD MENTAL ASYLUM ALTHOUGH SOME WINGS REMAIN IN DISREPAIR ITS STUDENT ACCOMMODATION AND IF ITS NOT SPOOKY NOISES IN THE NIGHT ITS DRUNKS COMING HOME FROM THE ESH AT SHOUTING AND SCREAMING AND IF YOUR NOT REALLY A PARTY PERSON YOU'RE LABELED AS BORING HATE THIS PLACE SOMETIMES
WAS IT SOMEONE OR WAS IT THE WIND
HAD A RACCOON KNOCK A WHEELIE BIN OVER WHEN I WAS IN THE USA CUTE BUGGERS BUT THAT SCARED THE FUCK OUT OF ME BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE A BEAR
I WAS OUT IN LIVERPOOL WITH A FRIEND A WHILE AGO AND HE WAS RATHER WORSE FOR WEAR THAN ME ON OUR WALK HOME STARTED GOING ON A BIT OF A MILD RAMPAGE BY KNOCKING OVER EMPTY WHEELIE BINS SO I PICKED THEM BACK UP AGAIN THAT'S THE WHOLE STORY
I LEFT FOR WORK AND EVERY WHEELIE BIN ALONG THE STREET HAD BEEN ALIGNED PERFECTLY AT DEGREES TO THE ROAD SITTING AT EXACTLY THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE KERB THAT WAS FUNNY
WITNESSED MY NEIGHBOR KNOCK OVER HIS WHEELIE BIN BY MISTAKE ON FRIDAY GAVE ME A GOOD CHUCKLE
HAEMORRHOIDS
I'M JUST GLAD KIDS GREW OUT OF THROWING STONES AND ITCHY CUES I HAVE NO IDEA THEY'RE LIKE REALLY FAT ROSEHIP AT WINDOWS AND SETTING WHEELIE BINS ON FIRE

ONE TIME WE STOLE A COUPLE OF FULL BINS JUST SO WE COULD BURN THEM ON THE CYCLE TRACK WHICH WAS SECLUDED FOR FUN HEAT WE WEREN'T HOMELESS JUST BORED AND SCUMMY
I SEE YOUR HAEMORRHOIDS AND I RAISE YOU WITH AN INGROWN TOENAIL
LEAVE
I BET IT TOLD YOU TO SHIELD YOUR PIN TO STOP YOU FROM BEING ROBBED TOO SOMETHING IRONIC IN THAT
HAVE YOU SPOTTED THE ELF SMOKING WOODBINES ROUND THE BACK YET OR REALISED THE REINDEER ARE ACTUALLY DONKEYS WITH TAPED ON ANTLERS I THINK THAT'S ABOUT THE USUAL EXPERIENCE FOR THIS SORT OF PLACE
FFS ITS NOVEMBER I HAVE NO SYMPATHY
YOU WOULD THINK THAT GIVEN HOW UBIQUITOUS CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS ARE IN LONDON AS WELL AS HOW MANY PEOPLE GO TO LONDON JUST FOR WINTER WONDERLAND THAT THEY WOULD EMBRACE IT
LIVING IN LONDON HEADING TO WINTER WONDER LAND LAST YEAR ANGERED ME SO I HATE BEING CHARGED FOR ONE GOD DAMN RIDE FUCK THAT PLACE

GOT AN FRIDAY MY COFFEE WAS MORE IMPORTANT NOW I'M THE PROUD OWNER OF COINS
RESTAURANT I WORK AT PART TIME HAD AN DROPPED IN THE CHARITY BOXES DESPITE THE MANY STAFF WANTING TO REPLACE IT WITH AN OLD FIVER OF THEIR OWN OFF IT WENT TO CHARITY MAYBE THEY'LL STICK IT ON EBAY

I HAD AN SO CLOSE
I CURRENTLY HAVE ONE BUT DON'T THINK IT'LL GET ANYTHING NOW THE CRAZE HAS DIED DOWN SO I'M GOING TO SAVE IT FOR WHEN IT'S OLD AND RARE MAYBE JUST FRAME IT AND SHOW MY KIDS AND GRANDKIDS ONE DAY
I BOUGHT SOME AAS WITH A NEW FIVER I PUT THEM IN A REMOTE CONTROL
WENT FOR
STILL HAVEN'T GOT ONE AND ONLY SEEN ONE
TO THIS DAY I STILL CHECK THE LATEST COINS ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT I HAVE ONE WITH THE MISSING DATE
HAD A CUSTOMER COME IN AND HAND ME A NOTE WHEN SHE HAD A NOTE IN HER PURSE WHEN I SUGGESTED SHE MIGHT PREFER TO USE IT RATHER THAN ENDING UP WITH RATHER LESS CHANGE BOGGING DOWN HER PURSE SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO TELL ME IT WAS AN AND SHE WAS SAVING IT BECAUSE IT'S WORTH MONEY

IF YOU'RE SAVING IT FOR A COLLECTOR OR SOMETHING WHY IS IT IN YOUR WALLET
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE SELLING ANY RANDOM NOTE AND GETTING OVER FOR THEM FROM PEOPLE JUST AS STUPID AS THEY ARE JUST FLOG THEM ANYWAY
EVERY DAY I PRETEND TO BE EXCITED AS I HAND A NEW BACK TO CUSTOMERS WATCH THEM CHECK THE SERIAL NUMBER THEN FEIGN DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THEM AS THEY REALISE THEIR NOTE IS SHOCKINGLY ONLY WORTH
IT'S FINE YOU OBVIOUSLY THREW IT AWAY AND STARTED AGAIN NO HARM DONE
YOU OBVIOUSLY HATE HIM DID YOU ALSO ACCIDENTALLY PUT CYANIDE IN IT TOO
I'M GOING TO COME ACROSS AS A SAVAGE BUT MY FIRST BREW IN THE MORNING IS NORMALLY A SHITSHOW SOMETIMES THE WATER ISN'T FULLY BOILED THEN ADDING COFFEE THINKING ITS MILK OR LEAVING THE MILK OUT OVER NIGHT AND HEARING THAT PLOP SOUND AS YOU TRY TO POUR IT
RELEVANT SUB R RATEMYTEA
MILK IN FIRST TASTE BETTER IMO

THIS FACT IS SUPPORTED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY

IF MILK IS POURED INTO HOT TEA INDIVIDUAL DROPS SEPARATE FROM THE BULK OF THE MILK AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE HIGH TEMPERATURES OF THE TEA FOR ENOUGH TIME FOR SIGNIFICANT DENATURATION DEGRADATION TO OCCUR THIS IS MUCH LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IF HOT WATER IS ADDED TO THE MILK

UK JUN
IT SEEMS DISTURBING TO ME THAT NO ONE BELIEVES THEY SHOULD WILL EVER DIE OF SOMETHING IF IT ISN'T THIS DISEASE IT WILL BE ANOTHER OK I'LL START ROCKING AND TELL MYSELF I'M NEVER GOING TO DIE NOT NOW OR EVER OF ANYTHING I DON'T WANT TO LIVE FOREVER I GUESS I HAVE CHARITY FATIGUE NO JOB JUST START A CHARITY
IS THIS THE ONE


GO TO THE BETTER ONE DO THE BUSINESS THEN VISIT YOUR ORIGINAL CHAP PARADE YOUR FANCY FOLLICLES ABOUT THE SHOP AND TELL HIM TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER OR HE'LL NEVER SEE THE LIKES OF YOUR LOVELY LOCKS AGAIN THEN MINCE OUT WITH A HUFF
THAT KEEPING YOU AWAKE LAST NIGHT WAS IT

GO TO THE ONE WHO DOES A BETTER JOB FOR THE PRICE THOUGHT THAT WAS A JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN GOING TO ONE FOREVER DOESN'T MEAN HE'S ANY GOOD
GO FOR A WASH AT ONE AND A BLOW AT THE OTHER
MAYBE A PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITE

IF ONLY EXISTED
SAME HERE BALLS HAVE DROPPED OFF NICELY
GO GET A FEW HOT WATER BOTTLES
THE PRODUCTION CREW KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING
I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW

SO GLAD I STOPPED WATCHING THE X FACTOR YEARS AGO
IMAGINE DOING SOMETHING AS A BIT OF A JOKE AND THEN HAVING TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AS THAT CHARACTER
SOMEWHERE AROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT CHICO WAS ON SO A LONG TIME AGO THEY DISCOVERED THAT ADDING A LIGHT-HEARTED ACT TO THE MIX HELPED TO PROVIDE A BIT OF VARIETY

UNFORTUNATELY LIKE ALL INITIALLY GOOD IDEAS IT THEN GOT PUSHED FURTHER AND FURTHER TO WHERE WE ARE NOW WITH MANUFACTURED JOKE ACTS WHO REALLY HAVE NO PERSONALITY AT ALL
THE PERSONIFICATION OF A JOKE NOT WATCHING X FACTOR AGAIN PROBABLY GOING TO WATCH IT NEXT YEAR
I HAVEN'T WATCHED THE SHOW SINCE ONE DIRECTION WERE ON IT YEARS NOW I'VE THOUGHT IT WAS FIXED FOR YEARS AWFUL TV
THE FACT THAT IT'S GIVING HUGE AMOUNTS OF FREE PUBLICITY IS THE REASON

EVEN THIS POST IS CONTRIBUTING TO THAT
GENUINE TALENT

MATE YOU'RE WATCHING X FACTOR
I VOTE FOR HER WEEKLY BECAUSE THE SHOW IS RIDICULOUS AND SHE MAKES IT ENTERTAINING THEY TAKE THIS MEDIOCRE SINGING CONTEST WAY TOO SERIOUSLY NONE OF THE WINNERS GO ONTO BIG THINGS ANYMORE UNLESS YOU COUNT PERSONALIZED BIRTHDAY MESSAGES OVER TWITTER AS A BIG THING
I CAN'T BE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAD TO GOOGLE HONEY G TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS

I THOUGHT IT WAS A NEW SUPERGOOD THAT PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT
PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE WHO GIVES A SHIT
I SAW HIM ON TELLY TALKING ABOUT HOW HE NEVER INTENDED TO BE ON THE POINTLESS SHOW BUT WHEN THEY MADE THE PILOT EPISODE THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYONE ELSE SO HE STEPPED IN FOR THAT ONE SHOW AND THE PRODUCERS THOUGHT HE WAS GOOD AT IT WHICH HE IS OF COURSE
HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME LOOKS WISE BUT GOSH HE IS REALLY LOVELY AND FUNNY

R MIDDLECLASSPROBLEMS
YOU DON'T NEED A CLEANER THEN
I'VE HEARD THAT THIS IS A THING PEOPLE DO ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POND ACTUALLY

COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY I'M BAFFLED WHAT IS IT YOU'RE CLEANING UP THAT THEY WOULDN'T
COULD BE WORSE

ONE OF THE PARENTS USED TO HIRE SOMEONE TO DO THE IRONING WHILST THE WOMAN WAS IRONING THE PARENT WOULD JUST SIT THERE WATCHING TV

FACEPALM
SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT YOU WANT THEM TO CLEAN YOUR HOUSE BUT YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO SEE HOW MESSY YOU LIVE IT'S A PARADOX
I WANTED TO GET A CLEANER IN WHEN I WORKED AWAY A LOT AND MY WIFE WAS WORKING AND LOOKING ARE THE KIDS SHE SAID NO AS HER PENSIONER GRANNY AND DISABLED MOTHER WOULD HAVE OBJECTED AND DONE THE CLEANING BEFORE THE CLEANER CAME ROUND SO WE WOULDN'T GET A BAD NAME IN TOWN
YOU'LL GET USED TO THE INTRUSION AFTER A WHILE
MY DAD IS QUITE LONELY AND HIS CLEANER IS A VISIT HE LOOKS FORWARD TO AS A PENSIONER BACHELOR HE TIDIES BEFORE SHE COMES TO CLEAN AND ALSO PREPS TEA AND BISCUITS IT'S ADORABLE
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THIS AS IF YOU'RE PAYING FOR SOMEONE TO COME AND CLEAN FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS YOU DON'T WANT THEM SPENDING THE TIME DOING THE BASIC JOBS LIKE WIPING KITCHEN SURFACES AND HOVERING AS THIS ONLY TAKES MINUTES TO DO YOURSELF IF YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT ITS BETTER TO LET THE CLEANER GET ON WITH THE BIG JOBS LIKE CLEANING THE OVEN OUT OR SCRUBBING THE BOG MAKES SENSE REALLY
WE HAD A CLEANER FOR A WHILE STOPPED BECAUSE WE WERE DOING EXACTLY THAT EVENTUALLY STOPPED BEING WORTH IT ONCE THE HABIT WAS INGRAINED
I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH CALOOL SPOONS AND G RAMEKINS

YEAH I KNOW LA DI DA
HOARDER
DOESNT IT TAKE A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF WATER TO GROW AND HARVEST ALMONDS
TELL HER ITS CAUSING WATER SHORTAGE IN SOME AFRICAN COUNTRY HIPSTER MUM
TELL HER OAT MILK IS PARTICULARLY GOOD IN TEA I FIND ALMOND MILK IS BETTER SUITED TO COFFEE EITHER WAY IT'S SO MUCH NICER THAN COW JUICE
ALMOND MILK IS DELICIOUS I SEE NO ISSUE HERE
IT'S COME AS A BIT OF A SHOCK THAT QUALITY STREET CHICS ALL HAVE NAMES I ALWAYS THINK OF THEM AS THE PURPLE ONE AND THE ORANGE ONE ETC
THE TOFFEE DELUXE WAS ALWAYS A FAVOURITE I'M NOT SURPRISED PEOPLE MAKE A FUSS ABOUT THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE ARE TERRIBLY NOSTALGIC ABOUT THE SMALL DETAILS THAT MAKE CHRISTMAS AND OTHER MAJOR EVENTS SPECIAL INTERFERENCE WITH ANY OF THOSE THINGS FEELS LIKE A THEFT OF OUR MEMORIES
HAS ANYONE TRIED THE HONEYCOMB CRUNCH HOW IS IT
BRITAIN MATE
I LIKE HOW YOU PERSONIFIED THE LEAVES YES THEY ALL DECIDED TO DO THIS THE LEAVES SAW HUMANS BEING PRODUCTIVE AND THOUGHT THIS WILL NOT DO THEY CONSPIRED AMONGST THEMSELVES AS THE HUMANS WALKED PAST UNDERNEATH UNAWARE THAT THE RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES WOULD SPELL THEIR DOOM THEN AT THE CHOSEN MOMENT THEY FALL AS ONE AND WREAK HAVOC ON THE NATION
WAS IT MID MOUTHFUL WHEN THEY ASKED

EVERYTHING OK WITH YOUR MEAL

HECK AS A SOMETHING DAD OF TWO I'M JEALOUS WHEN FRIENDS TELL ME STORIES ABOUT GOING TO A GROWN UP FILM YOU KNOW ANYTHING NOT BY DISNEY PIXAR OR STAYING OUT AFTER MY MUM WILL BE COMING TO VISIT US AT CHRISTMAS ME AND MY WIFE ARE SO LOOKING FORWARD TO HER TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS SO WE CAN GO TO A ONLY BAR WE'RE IN THE STATES SO AND HAVING MORE THAN ONE DRINK WE MIGHT EVEN STAY OUT PASSED MIDNIGHT WHO AM I KIDDING WE'LL SPEND THE NIGHT TEXTING MY MUM ASKING IF THE KIDS ARE OK AND DISCUSSING HOW MUCH WE MISS THEM
WHAT SORT OF PERSON GOES TO THE LOO TO SNORT CHARLIE WHEN THEY'RE AT HOME THAT'S WHAT BIG GLASS LOUNGE TABLES ARE FOR
WHY WOULD YOU SNORT COKE IN YOUR OWN BATHROOM
WHEN HE IS OUT BREAK IN AND NICK HIS STASH IT'S NOT LIKE HE CAN RING THE POLICE AND SAY SOMEBODY HAS STOLEN HIS COKE
HEY AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE AN EASY CONTACT FOR CHRISTMAS IF THE MOOD TAKES YOU
I'M A SOMETHING WITH MONEY AND TIME BUT TSH WATCHING TV OR VIDEO GAMES WITH A KID SOUNDS MUCH MORE FUN THAN DOING COKE AND GOING TO TOWN FOR ME

I THINK I'LL MAKE A GREAT BORING DAD
OUTWARDLY OUTRAGED BUT INTERNALLY JEALOUS
I KNOW THE FEELING I'M LONG PAST STAYING UP UNTIL DAWN ON A CHEMICALLY INDUCED RAMPAGE BUT THE ODD TOOT WOULD BE NICE AS LONG AS I'M HOME ASLEEP BY MIDNIGHT PERHAPS IF YOU COULD BUY THE STUFF IN SMALLER QUANTITIES A NEW MARKET WOULD OPEN UP A FULL WRAP WOULD PROBABLY KILL ME AND YOU CAN'T LEAVE IT
WHY NOT BOTH

WHY WERE YOU WATCHING THEM AND WHAT DOWNSTAIRS TOILET DOESN'T HAVE FROSTED GLASS HAVE YOU SET UP A LIVE CAM IN YOUR TOILET

I REMEMBER EATING SOME COLD SANDWICH ON BA COMING IN CHR STUPID ME DECIDED I HAD TIME AND TOOK THE TUBE INTO PADDINGTON HALFWAY THROUGH THE TRIP I HAD A REALLY BAD STOMACH ACHE THE TYPE WHERE YOU KNOW IT'LL EXPLODE I GET TO PADDINGTON AND RAN AROUND WITH LUGGAGE IN TOW TO LOOK FOR THE WC I FOUND IT AND THOUGHT ABOUT JUMPING IT I GAVE THE NEWSPAPER STAND POUNDS IN EXCHANGE FOR ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT
JUST BEG WITH A DESPERATE LOOK ON YOUR FACE YOU'LL SOON RAISE THE FUNDS PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME I ONLY NEED THEN I CAN GO TO THE LOO BEFORE I BURST

OR PERHAPS THERE'S A CASH MACHINE SOMEWHERE NEAR THEN GET CHANGE BUYING A MARS BAR FROM A NEWSAGENT
AT THIS RATE IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO BUY A TRAIN TICKET AND USE THE ONE ON THE TRAIN

OR JUST GO TO ONE OF THE PUBS RESTAURANTS OUTSIDE
CROSS IS THE MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS RUBBISH THERE'S A PUB WITH A NICER TOILET A LITERAL THROW FROM THE PAID PUBLIC ONES
JUST TELL THEM THAT IT WOULD COST MORE FOR THEM TO CLEAR UP YOUR PISS THAN IT WOULD FOR THEM TO JUST LET YOU SKIP THE TOLL
WHAT HAPPENED TO SPEND A PENNY
WHAT'S WORSE IS THOSE TOILETS ARE ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING TOO
I ONCE SAW MICHAEL OWEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THE CHARGE AT THE BARRIERS IN AUSTON STATION
WHAT IF YOU ONLY NEED PEE
PISS YOURSELF IN PROTEST
PULL THE TURNSTILE TOWARDS YOU HALFWAY THEN SLIP THROUGH WHEN IT GOES BACK
THE TOILETS IN COVENT GARDEN MARKET ARE TALK ABOUT SPENDING A PENNY
TO TAKE A PISS IS TAKING THE PISS
JUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
THAT MUST HAVE HAPPENED AT SOME POINT TODAY IT WAS STILL WHEN I WAS THERE THIS MORNING
AS AN AUSTRALIAN THIS WAS A HUGE CULTURAL SHOCK FOR ME I STILL CAN'T GET OVER YOU POMS PAY FOR THE DUNNY THERE ARE LOTS OF FREE TOILETS EVERYWHERE IN AUSTRALIA
SURELY GIVEN YOUR INTENDED DESTINATION YOU CAN PROVIDE THE REST OF THE P
SO GLAD WE DON'T HAVE PAY TOILETS IN THE US THANKS CITIZENS TO END PAY TOILETS IN AMERICA
JESUS
DESIGNATED
HOPE YOU GOT YOUR WORTH HAVE A SLASH A DUMP AND THROW UP

ACTUALLY IN SERIOUSNESS A SEASON TICKET FOR THE LOO MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA IF THE IDEA IS TO KEEP THE JUNKIES OUT THAT'D WORK AS MAYBE YOU COULD ONLY BUY A SEASON TICKET WITH A TRAIN TICKET
I REMEMBER YEARS BACK WHEN THERE USED TO BE PUBLIC TOILETS

MANCHESTER STAFF AREA THE STAIRS BY THE VIRGIN DESK BY THE CAR PARK EXIT USED TO BE A BARBERS AND A BANK OF BOGS IN IT WAS FOR A POO AND YOU COULD WEE FOR FREE

EASIER TO HOP ONTO A WAITING TRAIN USE THE TOILET THERE THEN HOP OFFICIAL ALTERNATIVELY THE TOILETS AT STATIONS THAT AREN'T MAINTAINED BY NETWORK RAIL ALMOST NEVER CHARGE
PISS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TOILET
I HAD SO I IMPROVISED
WON'T BE LONG BEFORE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE EXPRESSION TO SPEND A POUND
A FEW WEEKS AGO I WENT TO USE THE AIR COMPRESSOR AT TESCO IT WAS ONLY FOR MY BIKE SO I ONLY NEEDED A MINUTE OR TWO OF AIR I PULLED OUT A COIN AND INSERTED IT INTO THE MACHINE NO AIR INSERTED ANOTHER STILL NONE CHECKED THE SIGN ON THE MACHINE DOES GIVE YOU 2 MINUTES OF AIR STILL THEN MINUTES FOR BUT THE MINIMUM SPEND WAS A GRAND OLD
JUST JUMP THE BARRIERS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
DELETED
AS A PREGNANT LADY I'M SO GLAD THE LOOS IN CANNON STREET STATION ARE FREE MY COMMUTE WOULD BE COSTING ME A SMALL FORTUNE IN TOILET FEES OTHERWISE
WHEN WAS THIS I USED THE TOILETS THERE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND IT WAS
DON'T GET THE BIG FUSS IN THE COMMENTS ABOUT PAYING FOR TOILETS I GLADLY PAY TO USE THE TOILETS IN MY LOCAL STATION THEY ARE KEPT IMMACULATELY CLEAN ALWAYS STOCKED WITH PAPER HAND WASH ETC AND ARE ALWAYS SECURE AND DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH DRUG USERS ETC
JUST USE A TOILET IN THE ALL BAR ONE NEXT TO AUSTON
GET DISABLED THEN ONE OF OUR KEYS I HAVE A HAMMER SOMEWHERE IF YOU NEED A HAND
MOST OF THE POSTS IN THIS SUB AREN'T BRITISH PROBLEMS GOOD ON YOU

EDIT

AS SOME KIND OF MASTURBATION I VIEWED THE SUB TO SEE WHAT TRIPE WAS ON TOP THANKFULLY YOUR POST IS RIGHTLY THE TOP POST BUT RIGHT UNDER IT APPARENTLY IT'S A BRITISH PROBLEM WHEN BUS DRIVERS DON'T WAVE TO EACH OTHER I SUPPOSE GB IS THE ONLY PLACE WITH BUSES

THEN RIGHT UNDERNEATH THAT APPARENTLY IT'S A BRITISH PROBLEM THAT SOMEONE USED A HAND DRYER TO DRY THEIR HANDS INDEED IN OTHER COUNTRIES IT'S NOT A PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT ON SOMEONE FINISHING WITH THE HAND DRYER BUT IN GB THAT IS A PROBLEM TOP NOTCH
I HAVE A RADAR KEY FOR EXACTLY THIS PURPOSE IT'S PAID FOR ITSELF MANY TIMES OVER AT THIS POINT
WELL BREVIT
BALLS DEEP
IT'S PART OF THE CURRENT DEMOCRATIC TREND TO VOTE FOR THE WORLD TO BURN IT STARTED WITH BOAT MCBOATFACE CONTINUED THROUGH BREVIT AND TRUMP AND CULMINATES WITH ED BALLS WINNING STRICTLY
THE ANNOYING THING IS THAT BETTER DANCERS ARE GOING BECAUSE OF HIM I LIKE JUDGE BINDER THOUGH HES PRETTY SKILLED AND HE'S A JOY TO WATCH
MY AV IS JUDGE BINDER
IF THE PIZZA COMPANY DELIVERS 2 HOURS LATE I WOULD COMPLAIN TO THE COMPANY ABOUT THEIR SERVICE NOT THE PAWN WHO DROPS IT OFF AT MY DOOR

PAPA ASKED ME WHY I DIDN'T COMPLAIN TO THE FRANCHISE OR THE DRIVER FIRSTLY THE DRIVER I JUST WANT TO DROP IT OFF SO I CAN EAT IT EVEN IF IT IS COLD I NEED FOOD SECONDLY I ORDERED ONLINE AND NEVER SPOKE OR HAD ANY DEALINGS WITH THE FRANCHISE THEY ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY NOT MINE
OH I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU TO GO OUT OF YOUR WAY BY ORDERING DELIVERY THANKS FOR GETTING IT TO ME AT ALL HERE'S A FEW QUID FOR YOUR TROUBLES

YEAH DONE THAT
THEIR R BRITISHPROBLEMS YOUR R BRITISHSUCCESS

I IMAGINE THEY DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE TO BLAME FOR THE DELAY SO IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO PUNISH YOU FOR SOMEONE MISTAKE UNLESS IT WAS YOUR FAULT
WHAT CAUSED THE DELAY ANYWAY
IF SOMEONE DELIVERED A PIZZA 2 HOURS LATE TO ME I'D PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE WITH A HEDGEHOG
WAS IT THE EXTENDED ALBUM VERSION WITH ERNIE GUITAR SOLO

WAS A MAGNIFICENT ALBUM BUT I HARDLY EVER SEEM TO HEAR THAT LADY WHICH HAS GOT SUCH AN INCREDIBLE FUZZ SOUND ON THE GUITAR I THINK THE LAST COUPLE OF TIMES WAS WHILE I WAS IN SELFRIDGE IN MANCHESTER AND POSSIBLY M SOUTH AND RONALD VOICE IS SO PERFECTLY CONTROLLED ON SMOOTHIE BALLAD DON'T LET ME BE LONELY TONIGHT DISCO AT ITS FINEST
SOMETIMES THE THING THAT CAUSED DROP IN LIMIT HAS BEEN CLEARED BEFORE YOU REACH WHERE IT WAS SOMETIMES REDUCING THE SPEED OF TRAFFIC ACTUALLY MAKES FOR SMOOTHER FLOWING TRAFFIC AND CAN EVEN REDUCE JOURNEY TIME

ARTICLES

PROGRAMMES


I HAVEN'T DRIVEN AROUND BIRMINGHAM SINCE THEY SMARTED THE UNLESS I HAD TO I'VE EVEN USED THE AND INSTEAD AND EVEN IN TRAFFIC IT'S QUICKER

SMART MOTORWAYS SLOWING YOU DOWN TO FOR NO FUCKING REASON AT
AND SOMETIMES THE REASON YOU RE DOING AND A SIGN SAYS QUEUE CAUTION IS THAT THE SPEED LIMIT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO AND THERE'S A SIGN THAT SAYS QUEUE CAUTION
IT WOULD BE A SMART MOTORWAY IF THEY EMPLOYED SMART PEOPLE IN THE CAMERA CONTROL ROOM THAT CONTROL THE VARIABLE SPEEDS BUT THEY DON'T SO IT'S NOT VERY SMART

AS A FORMER BUS DRIVER I CAN TELL YOU THAT ANY DRIVER THAT DOES NOT RETURN A WAVE FROM ANOTHER DRIVER FROM SAME OR RIVAL COMPANY IS FORMALLY REGARDED AS A CUNT UNLESS HE'S TEXTING IN WHICH CASE HE IS FORGIVEN
IN OTHER WORDS THE AWKWARD MOMENT WHEN A STAGECOACH AND FIRST BUS DRIVE PAST EACHOTHER
I PAID FOR A BUS TICKET WITH A TENNER IN THE WEEK THE DRIVER DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND WHICH PUT ME OFF A LITTLE BIT
THERES ONE GO NORTH EAST BUS WHICH RUNS FROM MY TOWN HE HAS TO STOP IN THE ARRIA OWNED OPERATED BUS STATION ONLY RECENTLY HAVE THEY ALLOWED THE GNP DRIVERS TO USE THE TOILETS IN THE DEPOT
BUSES
SHOCKING
HAHHAHAHAHAHAHA I LIKE IT
THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY FARTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE WORD IS HE MIGHT CONTINUE LIVING IN FART TOWER IN NEW YORK
BEST HEADLINE SO FAR TRUMP SENDS SHOCKWAVES AROUND THE WORLD
I'M AN AMERICAN AND I'VE ADOPTED THIS TERM IT MAKES ME HAPPY
FROM STAFFORDSHIRE SOMEWHERE BETWIXT STAFFORD AND LICHFIELD TRUMP MEANS FART THERE TOO I SAY WE COIN THE TERM CONTUSED FOR FARTING
LIVERPOOL HERE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT FOUR YEARS OF GIGGLING BUT ANNOYANCE THAT HE'S SO LOUD I CAN NEVER MAKE A SILENT BUT DEADLY JOKE
IT CERTAINLY MEANS FART OVER HERE IN EAST ANGLIA I DON'T THINK IT'S GOT THE COVERAGE IT DESERVES DURING THE CAMPAIGN TO BE HONEST
AND ALSO LET'S NOT FORGET THE GORE BUSH ELECTION YEAR IT SOUNDED LIKE VIOLENCE VERSUS SEX WITH SEX WINNING WE HAVE HAD TWO LOTS OF LADY GARDENS IN POWER BY THAT RECKONING TRUMP TO ME SUMS UP THAT ODIOUS LITTLE MANUAL HE IS AN ARSE BISCUIT AND NO MISTAKE
THEY GONNA TREAT TRUMP LIKE A FART IN THE ROOM
AS A FORMER LONDONER I ALWAYS THINK OF HIM IN TERMS OF RHYMING SLANG EAST G
I NEED TO GO FOR A DONALD
IT DOES MEAN FART HOWEVER I BELIEVE THE TERM WILL DIE OUT IN THE NEXT YEARS I'M BEGINNING TO DISSOCIATE THE WORD FROM FARTING
IT'S ON UK NETFLIX THEY'RE PROBABLY SAVING TERRESTRIAL RIGHTS UNTIL JUST BEFORE NEXT YEAR'S SEQUEL RELEASE
DON'T WORRY THE BBC WILL HAVE IT ON AT CHRISTMAS AHAHAHAHAAAA
IT WOULD BE THE PERFECT CHRISTMAS DAY BIG FILM FOR ONE OF THE NETWORK CHANNELS WELL ITV OR BBC CHANNEL SHALL OF COURSE BE KEEPING THE SCHEDULE CLEAR TO SHOW CHAS N CELEBRATED CHRISTMAS COCKNEY KNEES UP ONCE MORE

COCKWOMBLES STILL WHING-DING ABOUT FIREWORKS

IS IT SO HARD TO KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE ENJOYING THEMSELVES
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS ITEM

EXPECTED WEIGHT

ACTUAL WEIGHT

EVERY LUNCHTIME
I ONCE HAD TO PAY SO PUT IN THEN A POUND HOPING TO GET A BACK GOT A LOAD OR AND DIDN'T EVEN GET MY BACK
GOT A FIVER IN ONCE I'M GOING TO GIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THAT WAS BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE THAT DAY HAD PAID IN I THOUGHT THEY WERE PROGRAMMED TO GIVE YOU THE HIGHEST DENOMINATIONS AVAILABLE ANYWAY
IT'S UNFORTUNATELY KINDA COMMON A VAST MAJORITY OF SELF SERVE TILLS ONLY HAVE SIX COIN HOPPERS AND IN THOSE HOPPERS ARE






2

THAT MEANS IF IT'S RAN OUT OF COINS VERY COMMON IN MY SHOP AT LEAST ONLY COINS ARE AVAILABLE AND GO TO AN OVERFLOW BIN
I GOT CHANGE AS TWO AND FIVE THE OTHER DAY MADNESS
I WORK ON THESE AND IT'S A TILL TRAY ERROR I'VE SEEN THEM GIVE OUT IN IT'S AWFUL AND IT'S ALL DOWN TO BAD LOADING AND CODING

I ALSO DISLIKE THE SCALES ERRORS IT CONSTANTLY GIVES OUT ANNOYING FOR THE WORKERS AND THE CUSTOMERS BUT THEY MAKE IT SO PRECISE TO STOP PEOPLE THIEVING I WISH THEY'D JUST MAKE IT EASIER TO JUST CLICK THE BUTTON AND GO THROUGH AND NOT MAKE IT A VISUAL PROMPT
I'M PART OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I TEND TO DUMP MY SHRAPNEL IN THEM THEN PAY THE REST ON A CARD
I ONCE PUT A EURO INTO A VENDING MACHINE IT WENT NOPE AND GAVE IT BACK TO ME IN TWENTY COINS DIDN'T EVEN LET ME SELECT THE BOTTLE OF WATER I DESPERATELY NEEDED AND NOW I LOOKED LIKE A DOUCHE IF I TRIED TO BUY A BOTTLE IN A SHOP WITH THE COINS
I WOULD SEARCH FOR ANY EMPLOYEE AND ASK HIM TO GIVE ME A REFUND
I'M STARTING TO SUSPECT ONE OF THE TORIES OWNS A PORNO MAG BUSINESS
I THOUGHT THAT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED
HOW THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY DO IT THEY CAN'T EVEN BAN PIRATEBAY DAAAAH PROXY SERVERS
MY TOWN DID THAT TOO LAST NIGHT I THINK WE JUST LIKE FIREWORKS THOUGH
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT I CAN HEAR FIREWORKS SO MUST BE THE SAME THING GOING ON HERE
IT'S THE PRE BLACK FRIDAY CELEBRATIONS
I THINK I'M GOING TO BE SICK
THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL FIREWORKS ARE USED AS A CELEBRATION AND ARE OFTEN BOOKED BY EVENT ORGANIZERS TO BOOST ATTENDANCE AT THEIR GATHERING

FOR MOST FIREWORK DISPLAY COMPANIES IT'S THE NEXT REGULAR GIG AFTER GUY ALKES AND BEFORE NEW YEAR'S EVE

OTHER THAN THAT ITS MAINLY WEDDINGS THAT KEEPS THEM IN BUSINESS DURING THE LEAN TIMES OF THE YEAR


I'M IN THE LAKE DISTRICT FOR THE WEEKEND AND THEY'VE JUST TURNED THEIR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS ON WHERE WE'RE STAYING IT WAS LIKE A FESTIVAL THERE WAS FIREWORKS A PARADE STREET SELLERS I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
YES AND
MARK
WORSE WHEN THEIR MUM IS ON HER IPHONE YAPPING AND SWEARING AT HER OWN MUM MAKES ME THINK ABOUT DUREX AND HOW SOMETIMES NOT HAVING ONE ON LEADS TO THE ABOVE SCENARIO
WELL AS I'M TRAVELING ON UPPER DECK I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I AM WITH MY HEADPHONES ON AND ALL BUS WINDOWS CLOUDY IT FEELS LIKE SOME SPACESHIP TIME TO TIME THEY COULD FIX IT WITH PROPER AC HEATING BUT WHY NOT
SERIOUSLY USE ABLOCK ORIGIN IF A CHANNEL IS WORTH WATCHING AN AD TURN IT OFF FOR A WHILE SO THEY CAN GET THEIR MONEY BUT IF YOU ARE WATCHING HUGE COMPANIES CHANNELS JUST LEAVE IT ON
THE COST WILL BE THE SAME NO MATTER WHO LIVES IN IT OR NOT IT'S NOT LIKE THE FRENCH KNOCKED DOWN THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES AFTER THEY BECAME A REPUBLIC
I THINK I HAVE A SOLUTION THAT WILL MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY
SO MAKE ANT AND DEC DO IT AND FILM THEM AS A REALITY SHOW
BLOODY BENEFIT SCROUNGING FAMILY
WELL THAT'S A LINE IN THE SAND PERHAPS THE SOLUTION IS HALF THE REPAIRS AND YEARS OF ANT DEC SECURED WE CAN ALL HAVE A VOTE IN A DECADE AND A HALF SEE IF WE ARE SATISFIED WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE MONEY WITH BOTH AND THEN DETERMINE WHETHER WE WANT EITHER OR BOTH TO PROGRESS

I APPRECIATE THIS IDEA COULD MEAN DOUBLE COSTS BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THE COST OF FIXING THE PALACE ISN'T GOING TO MYSTERIOUSLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY DOUBLE ANYWAY

I HAVE A PROPOSAL
WE TELL THE FAMILY TO JOG ON THEY RECLAIM THEIR LANDS HELD IN TRUST THE TREASURY LOSES AN ESTIMATE INCOMING FOR YEAR INDEPENDENT REPORTS THE ROYAL FAMILY BEING GIVEN FOR THAT YEAR THE SOVEREIGN GRANT IS OF CROWN ESTATES PROFIT

AS A RESULT THE UK PEOPLE SAVE A YEAR LOOSE A YEAR AND STILL HAS TO PAY TO RESTORE A BUILDING OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT

ALL THE WHILE THEY CONTINUE WITH PLANS TO SPEND M ON RESTORING THE BUILDING WHERE THE GOVERNMENT SITS WHILE SCREWING OVER THE PEOPLE
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND CAR INSURANCE AT ALL I COME TO RENEW WITH ANOTHER YEAR OF NO CLAIMS AND WHO EVER I AM WITH INCREASES MY POLICY BY A QUARTER OF WHAT I PAID THE PREVIOUS YEAR I CALL AND ASK WHY AND THEY SAY DUE TO CLAIMS IN THE SURROUNDING AREA I DO A QUICK GOCOMAPRE AND FIND OTHER POLICIES THAT MATCH WHAT I PAID THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND HAVE TO SWITCH OVER THEY OFFER NOTHING TO KEEP ME AS A CUSTOMER AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO ANY BUSINESS BUT THEY JUST DO NOT CARE
REMOVED
CHARTER EH

IT'S STANDARD PRACTICE TO PHONE ANYONE WHO GETS A QUOTE AND TRY TO CONVERT THE SALE

IS THE ISSUE HOW THEY HAD YOUR NUMBER
SO YOU PUT YOUR PHONE NUMBER INTO THE WEB SITE OF COURSE YOU DID
THE CLUE'S IN THE NAME OF THE COMPANY AND YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THE DEAL ON THE PHONE ON THAT CALL YOU CAN'T SAY THANKS FOR THE OFFER I'LL LOOK AROUND AND RING YOU BACK THE COMPANY DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT I HATE THEM ENDED UP USING CHURCHILL
I HAD THIS ONCE AFTER USING A SPEED CHECKER FOR A BROADBAND COMPANY I THINK IT WAS TALKY-TALK WHICH MADE ME REFUSE TO USE THEM
YOUR ADMIRAL QUOTE WENT UP MINE WENT UP TOO BUT THE ACTUAL NET COST WENT DOWN DAMN PREMIUM TAX BUMPED THE GROSS COST UP
I USED TO CALL DIRECT LINE FIRST TO GET AN IDEA WHAT THE ABSOLUTE UPPER LIMIT ON QUOTES WAS GOING TO BE

I CHANGED EVERY YEAR UNTIL RECENTLY BUT NEVER EVER GOT A GOOD QUOTE OFF DL IN OVER YEARS I DON'T EVEN CHECK THEM NOW



ED BALLS
SOMEONE DOWN THE ROAD WAS JUST HAVING A PROPER SHOW AS IN A FAIR AMOUNT OF HIGH-QUALITY FIREWORKS FOR A GOOD FEW MINUTES I ASSUME THEY'RE DOING IT FROM THE LOCAL PARK
EARLY FOR NEW YEAR'S
THAT'S OK YOU CAN USE THE COLLECTIVE MEMORY OF THE QUEUE JUST LOOK AROUND WITH THE I DON'T THINK I AM NEXT BUT CAN BE IF YOU ALL AGREE FACE WHEN THE CHAIR IS FREE
I THINK IT REFLECTS IMMENSELY ON BRITISH SKILL THAT WE HAVE A QUEUING SYSTEM THAT WORKS WHEN NOBODY IS STANDING IN A LINE EVERYBODY IS SAT DOWN AND MOST PEOPLE ARE PLAYING ON THEIR PHONES STARING IN TO SPACE OR ATTEMPTING TO DISCIPLINE THERE LITTLE SCOOTERS THE BARBER SHOP QUEUE REALLY IS A WORK OF IMMENSE PRIDE
TVS STILL HAVE CHANNEL BUTTONS ON THEM
HAS MISS MOFFAT SAT ON A TUFFET YET
THEY'RE APOLOGISING IN ADVANCE ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE THEIR PIZZA IS
THEY SEND YOU A SORRY CARD WHAT
THIS SEEMS TO BE VERY STORE DEPENDENT FROM MY EXPERIENCE AT ROYAL MAIL THE IN BARNET WILL POST LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THESE EACH WEEK BUT A BIT FURTHER SOUTH IN ANOTHER SHOP'S CATCHMENT AND I'VE BARELY SEEN ANY IT'S LIKE THEIR WAY OF KEEPING REPEAT CUSTOM THAT OTHER FRANCHISE HOLDERS ARE LESS KEEN ON
YOU SHOULD FREE PIZZA
I HAVE ON TAPE THE MANAGER OF A DOMINOS CALLING ME A FUCKING FAGGOT OR SOMETHING EXTREMELY SIMILAR BEEN A YEAR SINCE I LAST LISTENED FELT LIKE GOING TO THE LOCAL PRESS OR SOMETHING BUT I COULDN'T BE BOTHERED AT THE TIME THE EXPERIENCE WAS JUST SO SHITTY I WANTED TO BE DONE WITH HE WHOLE THING
THEY HAVE JEREMY KYLE AND HOMES UNDER THE HAMMER TO WATCH
BECAUSE SHOPPING DURING THE WEEK WOULD BE TERRIBLY CONVENIENT FOR EVERYONE ELSE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT
THEIR TOO BUSY CATCHING ALL THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT POSSIBLE FROM AM
NOT TO MENTION THE OLD BASTARDS GOING FOR A BLOOD TEST WHEN THE CLINIC OPENS AT WAIT UNTIL AFTER SO YOU DON'T MAKE WORKING PEOPLE LATE FOR WORK
WAS IN A TESCO AT THE OTHER DAY WAS LIKE AN EPISODE OF THE BLOODY WALKING DEAD

EVERY TELETHON IS THE SAME HARRY STYLES OR SOMEONE OF THAT ILK VISITS IMPOVERISHED CHILDREN A FEW MUSICAL ACTS A SPECIAL OF DOCTOR WHO OR EASTENDERS AND ONE DAY LIKE THIS BY ELBOW PLAYS AS BACKGROUND MUSIC
THIS USED TO BOTHER ME AS WELL BUT THINKING ABOUT IT I HAVEN'T WATCHED REAL TV FOR YEARS LITERALLY

IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE AT ALL NOW
BUT YOU'LL MISS THE NEWS READERS DOING A DANCE IT'LL BE HILARIOUS
IF THE CELEBS TRYING TO SHAME US INTO DONATING ACTUALLY GAVE THE MONEY THEMSELVES THEN NO CHILDREN WOULD BE IN NEED

WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE WITH A BUCKET STUMBLE TOWARDS IT MAKING RETCHING SOUNDS
PAEONS IN NEEDS
DOES ANYBODY UNDER WATCH TV NOWADAYS ANYWAY MIGHT AS WELL JUST PASS A COLLECTION PLATE AROUND PENSIONER HOMES AND SAVE THE PRODUCTION COSTS OF THE TV SHOW
LAST YEAR I HAD MY SKY BOX RECORD IT SO I COULD FAST FORWARD THROUGH ALL THE APPEALS STILL ANNOYING THOUGH

WELL IT WON'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT TERRY WOGAN ANYWAY
I'D PAY A YEAR EXTRA IF THE BBC AGREED NOT TO AIR THIS SHIT ISN'T COMIC RELIEF AND SPORTS RELIEF ALREADY TOO MUCH
THIS REALLY SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DELEGATED TO KARL PILKINGTON TO DEAL WITH
CHILDREN IN NEED AND COMIC RELIEF ARE GREAT FOR PULLING HEARTSTRINGS UNTIL YOU REALISE THE MONEY IS GOING INTO A TRUST FUND FOR FUTURE USE WHICH IS PROBABLY MORE BENEFICIAL BUT NOT AS IMMEDIATE AS THE APPEALS BETWEEN THE SUPER FUNNY MAKE OUT TO BE
THE GRAND TOUR IS NOW ON AMAZON SO I'LL PROBABLY RETREAT TO THE STUDY TO WATCH THAT I ALREADY GIVE QUID A MONTH AND SOMETIMES OF MY EBAY SALES AS WELL TO BARNARDO SO I'LL BE BUGGERED IF I'M GOING TO LET THEM GUILT ME INTO GIVING ANY MORE MONEY FOR KIDS

IT'S CHILDREN IN NEED I THOUGHT IT WAS THE TERRY WOGAN TRIBUTE VOL

SERIOUSLY THOUGH THE AMOUNT OF WOGAN TRIBUTES THEY HAVE HAD THIS YEAR CONSIDERING ITS BEEN NEARLY A YEAR SINCE HE DIED IS A BIT TOO MUCH
I GOT ACCOSTED BY AN OLD WOMAN IN THE STREET SAID HER NAME WAS LIZ SAID SHE WAS COLLECTING TOO
BUT WE ALL ARE OBLIGED TO WATCH THE SHITTY DR WHO SPECIAL THEY WILL HAVE EVEN THOUGH THE SHOW WAS DRAGGED THROUGH THE EARTH INTO HELL WITH THE END OF SMITH INTO THIS NEW DRIVE
SHOWERTHOUGHT MAYBE CHILDREN IN NEED IS JUST A BIG FIXIT SCAM DEVISED BY THE ELITE ESTABLISHMENT PEDOPHILE SCUMBAGS WHO SIMPLY NEED CHILDREN AND THEY'RE GETTING MONEY AND THE EXCUSE TO BE NEAR CHILDREN AT THE SAME TIME
HAVE THEY GOT NEWS FOR US NO JUST SOME NEEDY KIDS TONIGHT BRILLIANT
WHAT ABOUT QI
THAT'LL GIVE THE DIGNIFY GUESTS MORE TIME TO THINK UP THEIR AD-LIBBED JOKES

MARGINALLY BETTER THAN EVERYONE CRYING I SUPPOSE
RYANAIR THAT'S THE ONLY COMPANY I'VE EVER KNOWN TO DO THIS
I STILL FIND THIS AMAZING AND GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE PLACE YOU ARE GOING FLIGHTS TO AND FROM EASTERN EUROPE I FOUND ARE THE LOUDEST AND MOST APPRECIATIVE

WHERE DID YOU FLY FROM
PROBABLY THE SAME PEOPLE WHO QUEUE FOR THEIR PREALLOCATED SEATS DON'T GET MY WRONG I LOVE A GOOD QUEUE BUT IT JUST SEEMS POINTLESS TO ME
THANKS FOR DOING YOUR JOB AND NOT KILLING ME
I PREFER EVENTFUL FLIGHTS WITH EXTRAORDINARY LANDINGS

AS IF THE PILOT DIDN'T HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN GETTING THE PLANE DOWN SAFELY
THERE'S MARGIN TO BE PROGRESSIVE ABOUT IT A SOLEMN UNSPOKEN VOW TO NEVER SPEAK OF THE INCIDENT EVER AGAIN WILL BRING SALVATION TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP IF ANYTHING IT SHALL BE ALL THE STRONGER FOR FROM THIS DAY FORWARD IT CLIMBS ABOVE THE LOWEST DEPTHS IT COULD HAVE REACHED

RIP
WORSE THINGS HAPPENED THIS YEAR IS WHAT SPRINGS TO MY MIND
THERE WERE ONLY THREE GIRLS SAT NEXT TO ME THAT CLAPPED THESE WERE ALSO THE SAME PEOPLE THAT GET GASPING LOUDLY AT EVERY MINUTE REFERENCE
THERE'S HARRY POTTER RELATED REFERENCES NO WAY
IT'S AN AMERICAN THING I SAW INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE IN THE STATES AND THE AUDIENCE WERE WHOOPING AND A HOLLERAN AND CLAPPING ALL THE WAY THROUGH THEY NEED SLAPPED
IT'S INSIDIOUS I'M JUST WAITING FOR PASSENGERS TO GO WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY WHEN A PLANE CRASHES
THE ONLY TIME IT HAPPENED FOR ME WAS AT THE END OF STAR WARS EPISODE III I THINK BECAUSE THE AUDIENCE WERE RELIEVED THAT IT WASN'T AS HITE AS EPISODES I AND II
THE SAME THING HAPPENED AT LES MISARABLES WHO ARE YOU CLAPPING FOR THE PROJECTIONIST DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT
MAN FUCK THESE PEOPLE THAT'S EMBARRASSING
FUCKING ARSEHOLE THE LOT OF THEM
PEOPLE APPLAUDED THE SPEAKERS AT MY LOCAL REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY PARADE THIS YEAR
JUST CAME BACK FROM IT IT'S A GREAT FILM BUT CLAPPING IS NONSENSE AS WELL I PUT IT DOWN TO IT BEING HARRY POTTER RELATED AS MUCH AS I LOVE IT THE REGRESSION AND LACK OF SENSE PEOPLE SHOW WHEN TALKING ABOUT IT IRRITATES ME NO END
I WENT TO SEE THE FIRST TIM BURTON ALICE IN WONDERLAND WITH MY MUM IT WAS THE LAST FILM WE WATCHED TOGETHER SHE ALMOST CLAPPED AT THE END OF THAT BECAUSE SHE ENJOYED IT SO MUCH
HAD IT WITH STAR WARS EPISODE THE DAY IT CAME OUT AND IT SEEMED SOMEWHAT JUSTIFIED HAD IT WITH THE SNOOPY MOVIE THREE WEEKS AFTER RELEASE SEEMED SOMEWHAT LESS JUSTIFIED
IF YOU THINK THIS WAS CRAZY YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE CINEMA FOR THE FIRST VIEWING OF THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PT 2 PEOPLE LEFT CLAPPING AND CRYING
IS THE FILM ANY GOOD
WAIT THAT MOVIE IS OUT ALREADY
LIKE ANY GOOD AUDIENCE THEY ARE JUST SHOWING THEIR APPRECIATION TO THE PROJECTIONIST FOR NOT KILLING THEM
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE THERE
SHUFFLING SLOWLY OUT OF THE ROOM ISN'T AN OPTION FOR ME TRY LEGGING IT TO THE LADIES BEFORE I WEE MYSELF SERIOUSLY BRING BACK THE INTERMISSION ALREADY
SAME WAS THIS AT A CINEWORLD IN A PLACE STARTING WITH L
IRONICALLY MANY A BUTTON ON CROSSINGS DO NOTHING BECAUSE THEY'RE TIED TO THE NEARBY TRAFFIC LIGHTS ANYWAY THEY'RE JUST THERE TO GIVE YOU SOME ILLUSIONARY SENSE OF CONTROL IN YOUR LIFE
IT'S A MAN DRESSED AS A WOMAN WHOSE DAUGHTER MARRIES A SEXY WOMAN DRESSED AS A SEXY MAN IN THIGH HIGH BOOTS AND FISHNETS THERE ARE A COUPLE OF D LIST CELEBS DODGY DOUBLE ENTENDRES SEXY DANCERS SOMETHING FOR THE DADS AND THE LOCAL SCHOOL OF DANCE BRATS SHIMMYING DOWN TO RECENT HITS IT'S A GLORIOUS FESTIVITY OF TINSEL TITTERY AND FRANKLY IF YOU DON'T GET IT WE WILL BOO AND HISS YOU ALONG WITH SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE IN ALLO ALLO DRESSED AS THE BADDY WHO WOULD RATHER BE DOING HAMLET AT THE OLD VICTORIA HOW CAN THEY FAIL TO BE ENCHANTED PLUS MINUTES OF CHOCOLATES DISTRIBUTED FROM STAGE BY A PRINCIPLE CHARACTER AND A TENNIS RACQUET
I SEEM TO REMEMBER EFFORTS TO IMPORT PANTO TO THE USA I DON'T THINK PANTO WORKS IN AN ZONE
FESTIVE DRAG ACT AIMED AT THE UNDER FIVES WHAT'S SO UNUSUAL ABOUT THAT
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I BOUGHT TICKETS TO TAKE MY FOREIGN HUSBAND AND MOTHER-IN-LAW TO SEE THEIR VERY FIRST PANTO UNFORTUNATELY I WAS ILL AND COULDN'T GO BUT SENT THEM OFF TO SEE IT WITHOUT ME

THEY CAME HOME UTTERLY BAFFLED I LIKE TO IMAGINE THEM SITTING SILENT AND STONY FACED THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH IT STILL CRACKS ME UP
WHAT
OH NO YOU AREN'T
ITS CRAP THATS A GOOD PLACE TO START WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN GET ON WITH YOUR WIDOW WANKY
YOU'VE RUINED IT'S YOUTUBE VIDEO NOW
DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE A STRANGE COMPULSION TO PUNCH MANNEQUINS I NEVER HAVE BUT I FEEL THE URGE WHENEVER I SEE ONE
WAS IT SOMEONE DOING THE MANNEQUIN IF SO THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE PUNCHED THEM BECAUSE IT'S JUST HILARIOUS RIGHT EVERYBODY ON THE INTERNET IS DOING IT RIGHT IT'S WHERE YOU GET A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TO STAND STILL RIGHT IT'S REALLY REALLY AWESOME

SHUDDER
WAS IT THE ONE WHO HOWLED DURING SEX IN PORKS
YEAH TOPPING UP WAS PAINFUL THE FIRST TIME FOR ME TOO IT'S NOT SO BAD ONCE THE WEBSITE REMEMBERS THE DETAILS

I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHY YOU DONT LIKE THEM BUT IM ASSUMING ITS BECAUSE OF THE SAME REASON THAT I DONT LIKE THEM TOPPING UP


THEY HAVE ABOUT OF MINE THAT I CAN'T GET BACK DESPITE NO LONGER USING THEM BECAUSE THEY CHARGE A FIVER ADMIN FEE FOR REFUNDS
SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME I PAID FOR A WASH IT TOOK THE MONEY AND DECIDED NOT TO WORK PIECE OF SHIT UTILITY

ANY COMPUTER GENIUSES THAT KNOW HOW TO HACK QR CODES HIT ME UP
LINE SKIPPING

JUMPING THE QUEUE OR PUSHING IN WE ARE BRITISH REMEMBER
THAT WAS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK OUT THE OH DEAR YOU'RE AN IMBECILE LOOK PITY WITH A HINT OF SNEER AND SAY SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF THERE'S TWO QUEUES MATE BEFORE TURNING YOUR BACK ON HIM AS HIS EARS TURN RED

HELPING IDIOTS TO UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM SEES HOW STUPID THEY ARE IS A PUBLIC SERVICE
TODAY IN THE QUEUE FOR THE BUS SOME YOUTHS TRIED TO PUSH IN FRONT OF THE QUEUE AND SOME BLOKE STOOD UP FOR THE ELDERLY AND GAVE THE KIDS QUITE THE TELLING OFF IVE NEVER FELT PROUDER
THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE
GOING ON OUR NEAREST POST OFFICE OF A SIZE TO HAVE A TRAVEL SECTION THE POST OFFICE ARE AT FAULT THAT DESK IN OURS IS ALSO A STANDARD OPERATIONAL ONE FOR ALL THINGS POSTAL SO DO SERVE PEOPLE IN THE POSTAL SERVICES QUEUE AS AND WHEN THEY'VE NOT GOT TRAVEL CUSTOMERS

THIS CAN CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT ONE IS SUPPOSED TO QUEUE FOR IT IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IN NO WAY EXCUSES OR DEFENDS THE RATHER UNCOUTH MANNER IN WHICH THAT PERSON SPOKE TO YOU

WAIT YOU CAN MUTE THE VOICES

IN BEFORE SOMEONE SAY NOT THE ONES IN YOUR HEAD
AND I BET IT STILL DOESN'T RECOGNISE YOUR OWN NON BAG AS LEGIT
IS THE REST OF THE SYSTEM STILL ANYWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS WAITROSE
ON THE PLUS SIDE THE ONES BY ME NOW TAKE CONTACTLESS
LIPS HEAL VERY VERY QUICKLY IF YOU CAN JUST LEAVE THEM TO HEAL AND NOT WORRY AND TEASE AT THE CHAPPED BIT

UNFORTUNATELY IT'S DIFFICULT TO LEAVE IT ALONE
A CENTIMETRE DO YOU HAVE LEPROSY
I'VE HAD WORSE
BLISTER RELIEF CREME WORKS GOOD TO HEAL IT
NEXT TIME PUT CELLOPHANE TAPE ON IT AND PULL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
IF SOMEONE DOESN'T DO THE OBLIGATORY THANK YOU WAVE YOU KNOW THEY'RE A TOSSER
AS I GET OLDER I AIM FOR THAT MORAL VICTORY AND IF OTHERS DON'T RECIPROCATE THEY ARE BY DEFINITION NOT AS GOOD AS ME MY DAY GETS BETTER AND BETTER AFTER THAT
TIME FOR SOME PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE DRIVING
STILL NOT AS BAD AS THE WHATEVER UP AND COMING COMEDIAN THEY HAVE ON THAT WEEK SECTION THE WORST ARE EITHER AMERICANS OR AUSTRALIANS TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN CULTURE OR WOMEN RANTING ABOUT FEMINISM YET STILL MANAGING TO PLAY INTO THE AWFUL FEMALE COMEDIANS STEREOTYPE AND DOING NOTHING FOR EQUALITY

WORSE STILL IS ANDY MALTZMAN MAYBE I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT S CRICKETERS AND OBSCURE POLITICAL FIGURES FROM THE PREVIOUS CENTURY TO GET IT
PEOPLE LOVE TO SLAG OFF VIRGIN BUT THEY'RE NOTHING COMPARED TO PLUSHEST

WHEN MY VILLAGE FINALLY UPGRADED TO FIBRE ATTC IN APRIL WERE ALSO UP FOR A NEW INTERNET PHONE CONTRACT LOOKED AROUND AND EE OFFERED US THE BEST PACKAGE FOR CALLS AND INTERNET PEOPLE STILL USE THE LANDLINE

ANYWAY WE GIVE OUR MONTHS NOTICE WITH PLUSHEST AND THEN COORDINATE WITH EE FOR THE SETUP DATE FIRST TIME FIBRE INSTALLATION REQUIRES YOUR LINE BE HOOKED UP AT THE CABINET WHICH ONLY BT OPEN REACH CAN DO SO IT REQUIRES THE ESP TO COORDINATE WITH THEM

WE WERE GIVEN A DATE ABOUT DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE PLUSHEST CONTRACT WHICH WAS FINE I CAN LIVE FOR DAYS WITHOUT INTERNET WHILE THE FIBRE IS HOOKED UP

TURNS OUT INSTEAD OF CANCELLING THE CONTRACT PLUSHEST PUT A STOP ON THE ADDRESS A STOP AS IF NO ONE WAS LIVING THERE MEANING UNLESS SAID STOP WAS REMOVED NO ESP NOR BT COULD TOUCH THE LINE

BECAUSE OF THIS STOP WE COULDN'T GET HOOKED UP PLUSHEST DID BUGGER ALL TO TRY AND RECTIFY THE SITUATION BECAUSE WE WERE NO LONGER A CUSTOMER AND THEY CLAIMED WE'D ASKED FOR IT IT WAS ONLY WHEN I CALLED THEM OUT ON TWITTER AND THREATENED WITH AN OMBUDSMAN ON THE PHONE THEY TOOK THE STOP OFF THE LINE AND EE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO GET BT TO HOOK US UP

ALL IN ALL IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE WEEKS WITHOUT INTERNET


I THINK THE PHRASE IS MORE FOOL YOU VIRGIN OR BT AT A PUSH SKY CANCEL THE DIRECT DEBIT WITH THE BANK FIRST
DON'T BLAME THE STAFFORDSHIRE I WORKED FOR AN ESP WE WERE CONSTANTLY UNDER STAFFED CONSTANTLY THIS WAS ALSO IN THE BIT WHERE AKNOW THE FIRST LINE TEAMS CAN'T HELP AND PASS IT ON TO US THEY TOO WERE UNDERSTAFFED AND UNDERPAID
PERHAPS I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN THE UK WHO HAS HAD NO ISSUES WITH PN GREAT FIBRE SPEEDS AND NO OUTAGES IN YEARS I'VE BEEN WITH THEM
IT GOT WORSE SINCE BT BOUGHT THEM NO
MAYBE THEY ARE GROWING NEW STAFF FROM SCRATCH BUT THEN THAT IMPLIES THERE BEING LIFE THERE STILL
YOU MUST BE UNDER BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET A BIT OLDER YOU'LL REALISE THAT SNOW DOES NOTHING BUT MAKE YOUR ALREADY COLD FEET AND HANDS COLDER AND COMPLICATE THINGS LIKE DOING THE SHOPPING OR GETTING TO WORK SNOW CAN FUCK OFFICIAL
I STOPPED LIKING SNOW WHEN I GOT A JOB AND STOPPED GOING TO SCHOOL NOW IM A MISERABLE OLD BEFORE MY TIME BASTARD
YOU THINK THAT'S BAD TERRY WOGAN HAS A NEW ALBUM OUT THE GUY WAS EVER A MUSICIAN AND HE'S DEAD
HE'S A NEW CLASSIC FM PRESENTER
WORSE THAN THAT IS WHEN SOMEONE DESCRIBES A WOMAN AS BEING BUBBLY WE ALL KNOW YOU MEAN OVERWEIGHT
OR JEREMY KYLE THERE WAS SOME DAFT TWAT ON TONIGHT MOANING THAT HER ADDICTION TO CHOCOLATE WAS RUINING THEIR MONTH OLD MARRIAGE FFS
WHAT I QUITE LIKE IS HOW EVERY ALBUM HE RELEASED FROM HOURS ON WAS REVIEWED AND DESCRIBED AS HIS BEST AND MOST IMPORTANT WORK SINCE SCARY MONSTERS NEVER MIND THE CONTRADICTIONS SALES ALONE OF LET'S DANCE SAY OTHERWISE

LAZARUS WAS AN ASTONISHINGLY GENEROUS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND FAREWELL TO THE FANS THE WHOLE BACKSTAIR ALBUM IS INDEED GOOD BUT OBJECTIVELY NO PROBABLY NOT IN HIS TOP TEN THAT SAYS MORE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF HIS CAREER THAN ANYTHING LACKING IN THE ALBUM

HEATHEN HOW DARE YOU REFUSE TO KNEEL AT THE ALTAR OF CELEBRITY

BLESSED ARE THE FAMOUS DEAD EVEN THE ONES YOU NEVER GAVE TWO TOSSES ABOUT FOR OVER YEARS

FOAH GET OUT
THIS JUST CAUSED A BIT OF EMBARRASSMENT FOR ME IM CURRENTLY SITTING IN THE TOILET AT WORK AND THOUGHT ID TRY IT IT ASKED ME TO DRAW A CALENDAR SO I PROCEED TO DO SO ALL OF A SUDDEN MY PHONE STARTS SHOUTING I SEE A SUITCASE OR CHAIR THE PERSON IN THE CUBICLE NEXT TO ME SNORTS AND NOW I HAVE TO WAIT FOR HIM TO LEAVE BEFORE I CAN GET OUT THANKS GOOGLE QUICK-DRAWN
IT ASKED ME TO DRAW THE MONA LISA IN SECONDS

COULD EVEN LEONARDO HIMSELF HAVE DONE THIS
ALSO THEY DON'T USE A VERY CLEAR TYPEFACE HETP WHEN TELLING YOU WHAT TO DRAW
IT THOUGHT MY PICTURE OF A MONKEY WAS A POLICE CAR GOD DAMN AMERICAN POLICE CARS DRIVING AROUND LOOKING LIKE MONKEYS NO WONDER THAT COUNTRY'S GOING TO SHIT
I'VE JUST SPENT THE LAST HALF AN HOUR PLAYING I GOT POWER OUTLET A GOOD FEW TIMES

IT IS DONE

GALLERY OPWNM
IT DIDN'T RECOGNISE MY DRAWING OF PANTS BECAUSE I STARTED DRAWING
QUICK-DRAWN WITH GOOGLE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE MY DRAWING OF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER BECAUSE I DREW ONE OF THE GIANT AMERICAN ONES AND EVERYONE ELSE DREW A CANOE WITH AN AIRPLANE ON IT
THE BEAUTY OF IT THOUGH IS THAT THE MORE PEOPLE WHO DRAW A PIN PLUG OR SOCKET THE MORE LIKELY IT IS TO RECOGNISE IT IN THE LONG RUN

OR JUST DO WHAT I'M DOING AND DRAW COCKS FOR EVERYTHING THEN EVENTUALLY ANYONE WHO DRAWS A COCK FOR A JOKE WILL GET THE CORRECT ANSWER

DRAW AN ELEPHANT

DRAWS A COCK
IT'S AN ELEPHANT



DRAW A CAR

DRAWS A COCK

IT'S A CAR
FOR THE NEXT PICTURE INSTEAD OF DRAWING ANYTHING YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST WRITTEN OUT A PARAGRAPH EXPLAINING THE SUPERIORITY OF BRITISH PLUGS
HOW THE BUGGERY BOLLOCKS DID IT FAIL TO IDENTIFY MY LINE


BANDAGE GOT ME I BADLY ADMITTEDLY DREW A ROLLED UP BANDAGE THEY MEANT A PLASTER
POWER OUTLET

YOU MEAN PLUG SOCKET
IT DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ANYTHING THAT I DREW BUT WHEN IT SHOWED ME PICTURES OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAD DRAWN THEY WERE ALL REALLY TERRIBLE SERIOUSLY EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A DOLPHIN IN PERSON YOU OUGHT TO AT LEAST KNOW THAT FEATURELESS BLOB IS NOT AN APT DESCRIPTION

HOW DO I GET IT
I GOT MAILBOX
I THINK I OVERTHOUGHT THIS ONE A BIT IMPRESSED IT STILL GOT IT THOUGH HETP

IT ASKED ME TO DRAW A HURRICANE I RAN OUT OF IDEAS AND DREW A SAD MICHAEL FISH
WEIRD IT RECOGNISED MY GLORIOUS RENDITION OF A TRULY GREAT FEAT OF BRITISH ENGINEERING
SAME WITH THE MAILBOX I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S MORE WORRYING THE FACT THAT I'VE SPENT ABOUT HOURS PLAYING THIS GAME TODAY OR THE FACT THAT ALL MY FIRE HYDRANTS LOOK LIKE COCKS
HOLY THANK YOU FOR THIS IT'S AMAZING
SAME WITH THE MAILBOX I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S MORE WORRYING THE FACT THAT I'VE SPENT ABOUT HOURS PLAYING THIS GAME TODAY OR THE FACT THAT ALL MY FIRE HYDRANTS LOOK LIKE COCKS
INTERESTING THAT IT DIFFERENTIATED BETWEEN COFFEE CUP AND MUG EVEN THOUGH I WAS TRYING TO DRAW THE SAME THING WONDER IF IT'S BIASED TOWARDS LOOKING FOR THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DRAWING

SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN MY DRAWINGS I KNOW
I JUST TRIED IT AND IT GOT POWER OUTLET TOO AND IT RECOGNISED MY PINNED SOCKET SO IT'S GETTING THERE
IT DIDN'T RECOGNIZE MY MAP OF EUROPE WHEN I INCLUDED THE UK EITHER
IT RECOGNISED MINE I WENT BACK AND REVIEWED IT AFTER AND NONE OF THE SOCKETS PEOPLE HAD DRAWN THAT IT MATCHED WERE UK THERE WAS AN AUSSIE ONE IN THERE THOUGH
WHEN I DREW A PURSE IT NEEDED A HANDBAG FOR SOME REASON ALSO SOME OF MY PERFECTLY REASONABLE DRAWINGS FAIL BECAUSE THE EXAMPLES THE PROGRAM HAS TO WORK ON ARE RUBBISH
I GOT ANIMAL MIGRATION

AND IT ACTUALLY RECOGNISED MY HALF-HEARTED DRAWING OF A FLOCK OF BIRDS I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED
GOOGLE FAILED TO RECOGNISE PANTS BECAUSE I DREW
MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS GAME
TOOK TEN GOES TO GET IT TO RECOGNISE FLIPPERS ON THE FUCKING SEA TURTLE I BLAME IT ON YANK IMBECILES DRAWING TORTOISES
IT DOESN'T GUESS ANY OF MINE EVER

ETA NEVERMIND HAD TO TURN OFF AN EXTENSION
I WAS AMAZED IT RECOGNIZED MY RUBBISH SCRIBBLES AS ANYTHING LET ALONE GOT OUT OF
KEEPS ASKING ME TO DRAW THE FUCKING SISTINE CHAPEL
I FOUND THIS HARD HAVING NEVER COME ACROSS ONE OUTSIDE OF PICTURES IN HISTORY BOOKS
YOU SHOULD TRY BEING A RECEPTIONIST I HAVE THIS CONVERSATION EVERY FIVE MINUTES
SNOW WHAT SNOW
SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE SAID SO YOU DO GO TO THE HOSPITAL AS THEY GOT OFFICIAL
THE CORRECT RESPONSE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR ONE OF THE OLD BUS LADIES TO KNOCK HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A VICIOUS RIGHT HOOK AND THEN STAND OVER HIM SAYING YEAH YOU DO
EXCUSE ME YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE ASKING SO WHY NOT ANSWER SENSIBLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WORSE YOU BEING DELIBERATELY AWKWARD OR YOU DOING TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO GOT TO A HOSPITAL ANSWER THE QUESTION NORMALLY AND LET'S GET ON WITH IT
FIRST TIME I WENT TO LONDON I WAS BEMUSED BY THE FACT THAT THE NORM IS STAND TO THE RIGHT I'M ALL FOR A SYSTEM AND EFFICIENCY BUT SINCE WHEN DO WE OVERTAKE TO THE LEFT IT'S NO WONDER PEOPLE CAN'T SORT THEIR SHIT OUT WHEN THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY
AS A CYCLIST ALSO CAR DRIVER AND PEDESTRIAN WALKER OCCASIONALLY I TAKE THE SAME ROUTE FOR A CIRCULAR RIDE A FEW TIMES A WEEK PART OF IT IS A SHARED DEFINED BY THE COUNCIL PATH TRAIL FOR WALKERS CYCLISTS AND IT IS ONLY WIDE ENOUGH FOR TWO PEOPLE AND IS FLANKED BY TREES DITCHES UNDERGROWTH FIELDS ETC ETC IF ON MY BIKE AND I SEE PEOPLE IN THE DISTANCE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION I MAINTAIN THE LEFT AS THAT SEEMS MOST REASONABLE ALMOST EVERY TIME THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF STAND-OFF EVEN WITH SAY OLDER GENTLEMEN ONE LAST WEEKEND TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD SWERVE TO AVOID HIM THEM NOW I PERSONALLY WOULD ALWAYS GIVE WAY TO THE SLOWEST AND I HAVE CERTAINLY SLOWED DOWN TO ALMOST WALKING PACE TO PASS BE IT THE SAME DIRECTION OR OPPOSITE BUT I JUST CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHY THERE HAS TO BE SOME CONFUSION OR IN FACT BLOODY-MINDEDNESS

POSSIBLY NOT HELPED BY MY BEING A CYCLING RARITY ON THAT TRAIL ACTUALLY SLOWING DOWN MAKING PRESENCE KNOWN AND SOMETIMES NOT COMFORTABLY USING MY BELL IF I WALK THE SAME TRAIL I STAY TO THE LEFT IF ENCOUNTERING OTHERS AND DO SO FOR CYCLISTS WHO DO NOT ALWAYS FOLLOW THE SAME RULES THAT I DO SIGH
SOME ENTITLED OLD CUNT BERATED ME FOR NOT GIVING WAY TO HIM ON THE STAIRS AT WESTMINSTER TUBE

A I WAS ON THE FUCKING STAIRS ABOUT SECONDS BEFORE HIM AND HE WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY AT ME AS HE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS BEFORE ASCENDING

B IT'S THE FUCKING TUBE YOU WALK ON THE LEFT

OBVIOUSLY I EXPLAINED TO HIM THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T GET TO SEE THE LOOK ON HIS SMARMY WHEN THE AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT BOOMED OUT PLEASE KEEP TO THE LEFT WHEN ABOUT SECONDS LATER

NO WONDER STABBINGS ARE ON THE RISE
BUT ON THE RIVERS AND CANALS WE DRIVE ON THE RIGHT AND BOATERS WALKING ON THE TOWPATH TEND TO PASS ON THE RIGHT TOO OTHERS DO NOT SO IT'S ANARCHY
REQUIRE THE WEARING OF SWORDS SWORD CONTACT REQUIRES A DUEL TO THE DEATH THE PROBLEM WILL SOLVE ITSELF
IT'S THE FOREIGNERS COMING ON TO OUR STREETS AND WALKING ON THE WRONG SIDE

IJORE
REGARDING ESCALATORS A POPULAR FOLK EXPLANATION ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE'S MUCH EVIDENCE TO BACK IT UP IS THAT SOME EARLY UNDERGROUND ESCALATORS HAD A DIAGONAL RATHER THAN STRAIGHT END SO THAT YOUR RIGHT FOOT COULD STEP OFF ALONGSIDE YOUR LEFT FOOT WHICH WAS STILL TRAVELLING MOST PEOPLE ARE RIGHT-FOOTED AND FROM A STANDING START PREFER TO WALK WITH THEIR RIGHT FOOT FIRST GIVEN THAT THIS MEANT THAT THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE ESCALATOR WENT MARGINALLY FURTHER IT SEEMED LOGICAL THAT FASTER COMMUTERS SHOULD THEREFORE TRAVEL ON THE LEFT

WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ANY TRUTH TO THAT IT DOES HINT AT A VERIFIABLE REASON THAT STANDING ON THE RIGHT WALKING ON THE LEFT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE ON ESCALATORS FOLKS WHO ARE AT STANDING ON A MOVING PLATFORM FOR EXAMPLE THOSE WITH BALANCE DIFFICULTIES WEAKER LEGS ETC PEOPLE WHO ARE UNLIKELY TO OVERTAKE ON AN ESCALATOR WOULD PROBABLY PREFER THAT THEIR STRONGER HAND IS THE ONE THEY USE FOR THE HANDRAIL FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT'S THEIR RIGHT HAND

I DON'T KNOW IF EITHER OF THOSE ARGUMENTS ARE COMPELLING BY THEMSELVES THOUGH

I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU THOUGH THAT IN GENERAL I EAST EXCEPT WHERE THERE'S A RULE TO THE CONTRARY LIKE ON ESCALATORS APPARENTLY WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT WE WALK ON THE LEFT IT'D MAKE CROWDED CORRIDORS AND PAVEMENTS EASIER IF EVERYBODY JUST AGREED TO AND RESPECTED THAT AS A CONVENTION WOULDN'T IT
I'VE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE THIS FOR YEARS IT'S BASIC PRIMARY SCHOOL STUFF YOU LEARN VERY EARLY ON ALWAYS STICK TO THE FUCKING LEFT I'M SICK OF HAVING TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY OF AN IDIOT WALKING UP THE STAIRS ON THE RIGHT
I WAS CONSIDERING THIS PROBLEM THE OTHER AFTER BEING STUCK ON SOME STAIRS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ASIDE FROM CONVENTIONS IE DRIVING MOST PEOPLE LEAD WITH THEIR DOMINANT HAND

ERGO RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE MOVE TO THE RIGHT TO USE THEIR HAND TO INCREASE THEIR MOMENTUM

JUST A THOUGHT REALLY BUT IT SEEMS TO WORK
SUPERMARKET ISLES


OH FFS DON'T GET ME STARTED ANNOYS THE CRAP OUT OF ME NON COMPLIANCE SHOULD BE A HANGING OFFENCE WHILE I'M HERE WHY DO THEY STRATEGICALLY PLACE THE TUBE MAPS WHERE THE COLLECTION OF TOURISTS CAUSES MAXIMUM DISRUPTION OF THE ACCESS TO THE SODDING TRAINS
NOTE THAT WHEN WALKING ON A ROAD WITH NO PAVEMENT YOU WALK ON THE RIGHT HIGHWAY CODE RULE 2 SO YOU ARE FACING ONCOMING TRAFFIC
RULES DON'T APPLY TO PEDESTRIANS
THE EXCEL CENTRE IN LONDON HAS STAIRS THAT USES THE KEEP LEFT FOR SMOOTH MOVEMENT OF LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE THEY'RE FROM THE AIRPARKS TO THE MAIN CONCOURSE
SAME PROBLEM HERE IN THE US JUST REVERSE LEFT AND RIGHT
PRETTY COMMON TO SEE NOTICES TELLING PEOPLE ON ESCALATORS TO STAND ON THE RIGHT I MEAN YOU'D CERTAINLY HOPE THAT BREVIT WOULD SORT THAT SHIT OUT BUT IT DOESN'T EVEN SEEM TO HAVE COME UP YET
EASY ANSWER

I'LL WALK WHEREOVER THE FUCK I WANT
YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY WALK WHERE YOU WANT BUT DURING MY TRIP TO LONDON IT BECAME QUITE APPARENT THAT YOU NEED TO STAND ON THE RIGHT SO THAT PEOPLE ON THE LEFT CAN OVERTAKE
CONTRAIL MORE LIKE SCOTFAIL
I WORK NIGHT SHIFTS IN TESCO AND IT'S USUALLY PRETTY HILARIOUS TO SHOUT BLESS YOU TO SOMEONE WHO SNEEZED A FEW AISLES DOWN AND THEN GET A THANKS BACK XD
UNLESS THEY ARE ORDAINED INTO THE CHURCH THEIR BLESSING PROBABLY LACKS THE NECESSARY MORAL WEIGHT ANYWAY
I'D AVOID IT I'VE JUST DONE A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU SAY THANK YOU AFTER SOMEBODY SAYS BLESS YOU IT ACTUALLY KILLS THE FAIRIES HOWEVER IF YOU CLAP TWICE IT BRINGS THEM BACK TO LIFE

I'M SO GLAD THAT THE INTERNET IS A PLACE I CAN TRUST EVERYTHING I READ
I'D DEFINITELY SAY THANK YOU OTHERWISE THE PERSON WHO SAYS BLESS YOU IS LEFT IN AN AWKWARD LIMBO OF NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THE THANK YOU ROUNDS OFF THE EXCHANGE AND PREVENTS UNNECESSARY AWKWARDNESS
MY BOSS SAYS BLESS ME IMMEDIATELY AFTER SNEEZING AS IF TO ASSURE EVERYONE HEARD HIM THE TWAT
JUST STRIP OFF TO YOUR UNDERWEAR CANT GET MORE DRESS DOWN THAN THAT WELL APART FROM GOING STARK BOLLOCK NAKED
I USED TO TEMP AT A BIG FIRM IN CANARY WHARF WHERE EVERY FRIDAY WAS DRESS DOWN FRIDAY I HAD A SNEAKING ADMIRATION FOR THE SILVER-HAIRED SCOTTISH GENT WHO USED TO ROCK UP IN A YELLOW TANK TOP WHITE SHIRT AND CRAVAT
TWEET ANGRILY AT CUSTOMER SERVICE
DON'T WORRY YOU'RE OVER HALF AN HOUR LATE YOU HAVE A SEASON PASS WHICH PROBABLY COSTS THOUSANDS OVER THE YEAR YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET HALF THE COST OF A SINGLE FARE BACK IF YOU SPEND HOUR FILLING OUT THIER FORMS

SO GENEROUS SUCH STAND UP GUYS
I READ THAT AS I'VE BEEN FUCKING ON THIS TRAIN FOR HOURS AND I WAS KIND OF IMPRESSED THE REALITY IS MUCH WORSE
I WAS ON A SHINKANSEN BULLET TRAIN FROM HAMATA TO WHICH WAS MINUTES LATE ONCE IT WAS HORRIBLE I'M SORRY

CHAS RECT MARDY TRANSLATION YOU FIND IT VERY EASY TO GET UPSET
WAS THIS A DISPLAY OF GOOD OLD PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE BRITISHNESS OR DID PEOPLE GENUINELY NOT CLOCK THERE WAS NO DRIVER IN THE SEAT
YESTERDAY ON THE NUMBER IN MANCHESTER YES I MOAN ABOUT THIS BUS A LOT THE DRIVERS WERE DUE TO CHANGE HOWEVER THE NEW DRIVER HAD NOT TURNED UP YET BUT THE DRIVER FOR NEXT BUS HAD

SHE GOT ON OUR BUS TO TELL US THE DRIVER HADN'T TURNED UP I WAS CLOSE TO SHOUTING YOU FUCKING DRIVE IT THEN YOU BITCH BUT I DIDN'T BECAUSE I'M NOT A DICK

THE NEXT BUS TURNED UP AND WE ALL HAD TO PILE ON THAT INSTEAD AFTER WAITING FOR THE DRIVERS TO CHANGE AND IT WAS FULL

SORRY TO RANT BUT I'M STILL ANGRY
SORRY I DON'T BELIEVE THIS
TYPICAL BUS BANKERS
NO THEY DIDN'T
I SAID CHEERS THIS MORNING AS I LEFT THE BUS AND THEN TURNED TO SEE AN EMPTY SEAT FELT LIKE A RIGHT TWAT FOR ABOUT SECONDS AND THEN I REALISED EVERYONE WAS DOING IT I BET HE WATCHES FROM AFAR HAVING A LITTLE SNIGGER EVERYTIME SOMEONE DOES IT

I HAVE A LOCAL MACHINE THAT OCCASIONALLY ASKS POLLING QUESTIONS WHILE THINGS ARE LOADING IT'S USUALLY BENIGN THINGS LIKE ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THIS SERVICE YES OR NO LAST JUNE I WENT TO GET SOME MONEY

MY LOCAL CASH MACHINE PUTS UP A SCREEN THAT SAYS WE WILL NOW GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO SELECT WHICH CURRENCY WE CARRY OUT THIS TRANSACTION IN EXCEPT MORE WORDY AND THEY INSIST ON SHOWING IT FOR WHAT FEELS LIKE MINUTES WITH NO WAY TO SKIP IT

AND TO MAKE IT WORSE THE EXCHANGE RATE IS SO RIDICULOUS THAT NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD PICK IT I'VE HAD EUR BE TWO QUID MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MY CARD GAVE ME IN THE END
I EXPECT THE WHOLE SITUATION GOT ON YOUR WICK
DIRTY WICKERS

IT WOULDN'T BE SO BAD BUT THEIR SLOGAN IS MORE MUSIC VARIETY ONLY TO PLAY THE SAME PLAYLIST CONSTANTLY
MORE MUSIC VARIETY THIS TAKE THAT SONG WE'RE PLAYING IS DIFFERENT TO THE ONE WE PLAYED AN HOUR AGO
BONUS POINTS FOR WHEN THEY PLAY A SONG WITH THE WORD HEART IN IT
ISN'T THAT JUST EVERY RADIO STATION
I USED TO LISTEN TO HEART AND FOUND THAT WHILE THEY SAID NO REPEAT OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT IT WAS ONLY PER DJ PER DAY

AFTER LISTENING TO BILLIE JEAN FOR THE 4TH TIME IN ONE DAY AFTER DAYS OF THE SAME THING I SWITCHED TO SOME ROCK STATION AND NEVER WENT BACK
UGH I HATE HEART FM I NOW HATE CAN'T STOP THE FEELING AND DANCING ON MY OWN AS THEY PLAY THEM NON STOP AND ALL THE BLOOMING DANCE HITS THEY REPEATEDLY PLAY GET ON MY NERVES
THEY PLAY THE SAME JASON FERULLO SONG EVERYDAY TIMES A DAY AND IT'S NOT EVEN HIS NEWEST SONG THEY MUST HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH HIS RECORD LABEL I SWEAR
JUST A SMALL TOWN BOY
CAPITAL FM IS JUST AS BAD
NATALIE IMBRUGLIA TORN

HEART IS THE ONLY PLACE THIS SONG IS EVER BLOODY ON IT MUST BE YEARS OLD AND WASN'T EVEN THAT POPULAR WHEN IT CAME OUT THEY PLAY IT SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
EVERY MORNING I HEAR THE NEW LITTLE MIX SONG LEAVE ME ALONE
WAVE IS THE FUCKING WORST THEY PLAYED EVERY SONG ON MY SHIT LIST ONE AFTER THE OTHER LAST WEEK MY SHIT LIST IS

LET'S MARVIN GAYE MEGHAN TRAINOR AND THAT ANNOYING LITTLE SHIT WHO CAN'T SINGULAR

DANCING ON MY OWN THAT GUY WHO SOUNDS LIKE HE'S GAGGING ON A COCK

SEE YOU AGAIN THE ANNOYING MARVIN GAYE SINGER

EDIT FORGOT THAT FUCKING BORING BEICE OF SHIT IDLEWILD TRAVIS I CAN REMEMBER WHEN TRAVIS WERE GOOD
MORE MUSIC VARIETY THIS IS HEART

THE SAME OLD GIRLY SHIT ALL DAY EVERY DAY THIS IS CHART
I LISTENED TO HEART ON MY WAY TO AND FROM WORK EVERYDAY UNTIL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHEN I SUDDENLY REALISED I WAS PRETTY MUCH LISTENING TO THE SAME SONGS IN THE SAME ORDER EVERY DAY
WHERE I LIVE YOU HAVE 2 CHOICES HEART OR KISS

KISS IS LIKE LISTENING TO A LOAD OF TEENAGERS SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER ALL DAY

HEART IS JUST ADVERTS CONSTANT FUCKING ADVERTS

FIVE LIVE IS MY GO TO IF YOU DRIVE ALL DAY THEN IT'S LIKE HAVING SOMEONE IN THE CAR WITH YOU
HEART LONDON AND HEART SURREY ARE UNBEARABLE I VISIT MY DEAF IN HER NURSING HOME EVERY WEEKEND AND THE CARERS LEAVE HER RADIO ON HEART AT SO SHE CAN HEAR IT SHE CAN'T

I TURN THE VOLUME RIGHT DOWN THE MOMENT I ARRIVE BUT AFTER TWO HOURS OF HEART SIMPLY WHISPERING THE SAME BLOODY SONGS TO ME I JUST WANT TO RIP MY EARS OFF AND EAT THEM
ATLEAST YOU GET MUSIC ALL I SEEM TO FIND ARE RADIO STATIONS NATTERING ABOUT UTTER CRAP
ONLY TIME I LISTEN IS ON A SUNDAY NIGHT ALL WITH JASON DONOVAN

CURRENTLY I'M WAITING FOR THE NEXT TIME I GET A CALL ABOUT BEING IN A CAR ACCIDENT THAT WASN'T MY FAULT I THINK IT'LL BE THE FOURTH ONE SINCE THE FIRST TIME I ASKED THE SAME COMPANY TO REMOVE MY DETAILS I DON'T OWN A CAR I DON'T HAVE A FULL DRIVING LICENCE AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT LET ALONE ONE THAT WAS NOT MY FAULT

MY PARENTS HAVE ALSO TAKEN TO NOT ANSWERING THE PHONE UNLESS THEY KNOW THE NUMBER WHEN I VISIT THEM I'M ALWAYS UP FOR WASTING THE COLD TIME BUT THEY BASED ON NO EVIDENCE ARE CONVINCED THAT THE NUMBER OF CALLS WILL INCREASE OR THEY'LL GET CHARGED
IMAGINE BEING A MAN WHO DOESN'T LIKE THE TASTE TEXTURE OF LETTUCE

THERE IS ABOUT 2 SANDWICHES I CAN ENJOY FROM SUPERMARKETS
SAINTSBURY DOES NO MAYO HAM NO MAYO BACON AND NO MAYO CHICKEN LITERALLY JUST BREAD SAUCE AND MEAT

I'VE TAKEN TO BUYING A PACK OF CHEESE AT THE START OF THE WEEK AND USING IT UP ON THE SANDWICHES BY THE END
THE SHOP NEXT DOOR TO MY OFFICE SELLS PLAIN HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICHES

CONTAINS HAM CHEESE MAYO
THIS ALL DAY LONG IT'S DRIVING ME MAD I JUST WANT CHICKEN BUTTER AND BREAD
THE RISE OF MAYONNAISE FASCISM IS A WORLD PROBLEM I HAVE BEEN PERSECUTED MY WHOLE LIFE BY IT FIRST OF ALL IT WAS THE HELLMAN YOUTH THEN IT WAS THE FANATICAL CREAMY WHITE SHIRTS
CAN CONFIRM IT'S A PROBLEM SOURCE AM ALLERGIC TO MAYO
IT'S GREAT ISN'T IT MAYO IS WONDERFUL
I HATE MAYO WITH A PASSION AND I GET YOUR STRUGGLE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT SAYS LIKE CHICKEN AND SOMETHING AND WHEN YOU READ THE INGREDIENT IT'S ALWAYS MAYO AS WELL
I CAN CONFIRM YOU WERE JUST UNLUCKY M S DO SELL NO MAYO SANDWICHES I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'VE EATEN ONE THEY EVEN HAVE A LITTLE NO MAYO LOGO ON THE FRONT
I'M AFRAID I LOVE MAYO ON EVERYTHING EVEN BACON AND CHIPS I'M SO ASHAMED
ISN'T THERE ONE CALLED JUST CHEESE AND ANOTHER CALLED JUST HAM

NOT VERY EXCITING BUT STILL
FUCK MAYONNAISE AND FUCK EVERYONE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT BEING IN NEARLY ALL SHOP BOUGHT SANDWICHES

AT LEAST ONE OF THE M S WRAPS DOESN'T CONTAIN MAYO CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH BEEN A FEW MONTHS SINCE I ATE IT
HAS NO ONE ITT BOUGHT A SANDWICH FROM A SHOP BEFORE
I'LL TRADE YOU ALL THE OTHERWISE DECENT SANDWICHES AT TESCO THAT ARE RUINED BY HAVING ABSOLUTELY NO FOOD LUBE IN THEM
MAYBE SHOWING MY AGE BUT WHEN DID CALLING IT MAYO RATHER THAN MAYONNAISE BECOME THE NORM
MY PROBLEM IT SEEMS IS THAT IF I'M EVER BUYING A SANDWICH FROM SOMEWHERE LIKE COSTA IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ONE WITHOUT CHEESE IF I DON'T FEEL LIKE FISH I'M NOT ALLERGIC TO CHEESE BUT I CAN'T STAND IT IN SANDWICHES
THIS SORT OF THING WAS WHY I ALWAYS HAVE A BOTTLE OF SALAD CREAM IN MY DESK DRAWER TO SMOTHER THE DEGUSTING MAYO WITH SOMETHING I LIKE
THEY USED TO DO A GREAT CHICKEN NO MAYO ONE DID YOU KNOW THEY USED YOGHURT AS A SUBSTITUTE TO THE MAYO
I QUITE LIKE MAYONNAISE AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT A LOT OF IT

I RECALL IN MY ADDLED YOUTH OUR SMALL GATHERING WOULD PATRONISE A LOCAL KC RESTAURANT OF A FRIDAY EVENING THE BEHATTED INDIVIDUALS OCCUPIED THEREIN WOULD DOUSE OUR ZINGER BURGERS IN SUCH GENEROUS QUANTITIES OF MAYONNAISE THAT ONCE ONE HAD SLIPPED AND SLID ONE'S WAY TO THE ULTIMATE CONSUMPTION OF THE EVENING'S REPAST ONE MIGHT WELL BE MISTAKEN FOR AN EXTRA IN A PORNOGRAPHIC FILM IT WAS A MATTER OF SOME HUMOUR AMONGST OUR COMPANY
MY F WORKS IN M S AND WELL
SANDWICHES WITHOUT MAYO ARE SO DRY
MAYO IS GREAT
AH FUCK I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'VE DONE THIS
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE REFER TO CRIMBLE YET
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING AN ALIEN SPECIES MIGHT SAY TO BLEND IN WITH FELLOW HUMANS
A HEFTY PERCENTAGE OF VICARRING IS PLACATING ANGRY PEOPLE OVER TRIVIAL THINGS

SOURCE NOT A VICAR BUT KNOW QUITE A FEW THE ONES I KNOW ARE AWESOME PEOPLE WHO GENUINELY ARE TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND LOOK AFTER PEOPLE AND THEY GET A LOT OF SHIT THROWN AT THEM NOT LITERALLY SO FAR
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO DO THAT I'M OFF TO GET A BOOK OF STAMPS AND SOME SWANKY STATIONERY

IT IS CHEAPER THAN BUYING A BOTTLE OF COKE AND BETTER FOR YOU
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER YOU USED TO SEE CHADS JUST DRINKING MILK ON THE STREET WHICH I THOUGHT WAS WEIRD

NOW I'M OLDER YOU NEVER SEE IT AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE A THING
CLEARLY MAKING SURE HE DOESN'T END UP ONLY BEING GOOD ENOUGH TO PLAY FOR ACCRINGTON STANLEY
MAYBE HE HAD JUST CONSUMED PINTS OF BLACK TEA AND WANTED THE BREW TO BE DONE PROPERLY

FUCKING SAVAGE
I'LL HAPPILY HAVE THOSE TWIRLS IF YOU DON'T WANT EM MATE
SOUNDS LIKE MY DREAM TUB I LOVE FUDGE BARS
IT'S ALL BLOODY ECLAIRS AND DAIRY MILK BORING SHIT
AND WHAT IN GOD'S NAME IS A POPSICLE
I FOUND A LUMP ON A TESTICLE ONCE AND WAS DOING THE CLASSIC MAN THING OF INSTEAD OF CALLING THE DOCTOR ANYWAY I ONCE STARTED A VIDEO AT WORK OUT LOUD THAT WENT MY TESTICLES ARE

AWKWARD
WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE FACEBOOK VIDEOS THAT EDIT IT IN NEAR THE END
IF I WAS THAT PERSON I'D BE GLAD NOBODY REACTED
WAS IT THE DRIVER
THAT'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM THOUGH IS IT AS FAR AS BRITISHNESS GOES STONE-FACED SILENCE AND A COMPLETE LACK OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM EVERYONE INVOLVED FEELS LIKE OUR SOCIETY WORKING AS INTENDED
INTERNAL TUTTING INTENSIFIES
R BRITISHSUCCESS
NOBODY REACTED

SOUNDS ALMOST TOO BRITISH
R BRITISHPROBLEMSUCCESS
HOLY SHIT THIS HAPPENED TO ME AT READING STATION A FEW DAYS AGO GUY OPPOSITE ME IN THE WAITING ROOM IT WAS JUST HIM AND I IN THE ROOM STARTED PLAYING SOMETHING ON HIS PHONE THAT SOUNDED LIKE A WOMAN MOANING HE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK UP AT ME

AWKWARD
DID THE PORNOGRAPHY HAVE AMERICAN ACCENTS REAL PROBLEMS BEING ADDRESSED
LUCKY BREAK THERE PAL
I'VE DONE THAT IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD
THIS REALLY IS A BRITISH PROBLEM AND ITS A REFLECTION OF MODERN LIVING

EVERYONE HAS THERE HEAD IN THEIR SMART PHONE BEING SOCIAL WITH PEOPLE THERE RARELY MEET WHILE IGNORING LIFE AROUND THEM WE'VE NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE PEOPLE DON'T INTERACT AND IF YOU DID YOU WOULD BE CLASSED AS WEIRD

BRITISH PEOPLE USE TO TALK NOW WE STARE AT SMART PHONES OR THE FREE PAPERS PRETENDING THAT THE PEOPLE AROUND US DOESN'T EXIST
SORRY MUPPET

I'D BUY A CRACKER THAT PLAYED RICK ASTLEY WHEN OPENED
THANKS FOR THE CRACKER OF AN IDEA
EH I'D PREFER MEMES
MEMES FOR EVERY OCCASION
I THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME I NEVER IMAGINED CORY TAYLOR ON QI BUT HE FIT IN VERY WELL
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS HIM DOESN'T HE USUALLY WEAR A MASK

THAT'S NO WAY TO TALK ABOUT SANDY TOKSVIG
HE'S BEEN A FAN OF THE SHOW FOR YEARS AND HAS WANTED TO BE ON FOR JUST AS LONG

HE'S SAID ON TWITTER HE WANTS TO RETURN AT SOME POINT
DID YOU SPECIFY HP SAUCE OR ALTERNATIVELY DADDIES SAUCE IF YOU ARE A SWEET-TOOTHED HEATHEN OR DID YOU JUST SPECIFY BROWN SAUCE A DESCRIPTION WITH WHICH BBQ SAUCE WOULD COMPLY IF SO YOU ONLY HAVE YOURSELF TO BLAME AND IS TYPICAL OF THE KIND OF WEAK-MINDED LAZINESS WHICH LOST US THE COMMONWEALTH ACROSS THE ATLANTIC AND ULTIMATELY LED TO THE COLLAPSE OF THAT PANNICLE OF CIVILISATION THE BRITISH EMPIRE

SORRY
WHAT HUH WHO ER WHY WHO THE BROOD CONFUSES BROWN SAUCE WITH BBQ
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS
WHAT WAS ON YOUR BREAKFAST BUTTY IF IT WAS JUST SAUSAGE IT MIGHT BE SALVAGEABLE BUT IF THERE WAS BACON AND OR EGG I'M AFRAID YOU'VE LOST THE BATTLE

THE TABLOIDS LOVE TO USE BOFFINS WHEN SCIENTISTS DO SOMETHING THEY AGREE WITH AND EGGHEADS WHEN SCIENTISTS TELL THEM SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM AT ITS FINEST
WOULDN'T EVEN WIPE MY ARSE WITH THE SUN
THE WORD BOFFIN IS SOMEHOW BOTH HILARIOUS AND TOTALLY ENRAGING FOR ME
IT'S BETTER THAN SPASTIC EGGHEAD I SUPPOSE
I LIKE BOFFIN THE REGISTER HAS USED IT FOR YEARS IN THE PROPER SENSE TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE SO FAR AHEAD IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY AREN'T MERE EXPERTS NOT SURE IF THE SCUM GETS THAT THOUGH
I FIND THE WORD BOFFIN HUMOROUS AFFECTIONATE AND EXTREMELY BRITISH
TIL SOMEONE ACTUALLY READ THE SUN I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR LINING THE CAT LITTER TRAY
THE REAL PROBLEM IS IN OP ACTUALLY READING THE SUN
DON'T BUY THE SUN
JESUS BOFFIN IS BACK IN THE VOCABULARY NOT HEARD THAT ONE IN ABOUT YEARS
IT'S A VERY DELIBERATE USAGE OF THE WORD EXPERTS WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THEM AND SCIENTISTS INTIMIDATE THE

TO BE FAIR HE DOES DO A SURPRISINGLY LARGE AMOUNT OF BOFFIN ISN'T HE ON LIKE HIS THIRD WIFE NOW

I ONCE WENT INTO THE CO-OP AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BIDDIE BUS WAS DROPPING OFF OLD LADIES TO DO THEIR SHOPPING LONGEST PINT OF MILK EVER

WHY WERE YOU WEARING A GUY FAWKES MASK
A SHOP NEAR ME HAS A MANNEQUIN WITH AN ANONYMOUS MASK STANDING OUTSIDE THE SHOP EVERY DAY

EDIT SUCH AN INTERESTING FACT TO SHARE
AS SOMEONE DOING NAT MEDIA AND STUDYING V FOR VENDETTA MIGHT JUST CASUALLY ADD THIS TO MY CULTURAL EFFECTS RESEARCH
I DON'T THINK EVERYONE WHO OWNS ONE IS ODD OR WHATEVER DO HATE THE PEOPLE WHO PRETEND THEY'RE PART OF ANONYMOUS AND HAVE THEIR PROFILE PICTURE SET TO IT FOR EXAMPLE

I DON'T MIND JIMMY WALES ASKING FOR MONEY

WIKIPEDIA DON'T CARRY A BOAT LOAD OF ADVERTISING AND IT'S FOR THAT REASON I WON'T GIVE THE GUARDIAN ANY MONEY
DO YOU PAY FOR THEIR CONTENT DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH GOOD JOURNALISM COSTS

I HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE FT AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT TO GET ACCURATE AND USEFUL NEWS THAT CANNOT BE FUNDED BY GOODWILL IF YOU LIKE THEIR ARTICLES BECOME A MEMBER
WOULD HELP IF THEY DIDN'T GO FULL TUMBLRITE BEMOANER
AS THEY USE A SHELL COMPANY TO AVOID PAYING TAX SO I USE GOOGLE TO AVOID PAYING FOR ANY OF THEIR ARTICLES
THE WORST PART IS THEY DON'T SHUT UP EVEN IF YOU DO PAY STILL GET ADVERTS TOO

THE INDY INSISTS ON SAYING THANKS FOR SUPPORTING US EVERY TIME YOU GO TO THE SITE
NEWS ARTICLES
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ITS JUST A SUPERSTITION AFTER ALL


I MEAN SURE YOU'LL PROBABLY WAKE UP TONIGHT TO THE SOUND OF HUNDRED OF MAGPIES PECKING AT YOUR WINDOWS AND CAWING HUNGRILY AT YOU IN A HORRIFIC DEVIL'S CHORUS BUT THATS TO BE EXPECTED PERFECTLY STANDARD BEHAVIOUR THEY RECOGNISE FACES DONTCHAKNOW CLEVER BIRDS

ANYWAY JUST WANTED TO PUT YOUR MIND AT REST YOU'LL BE FINE IF YOU DONT LEAVE THE HOUSE I'M NEARLY SURE OF IT
BE RECT BEST SALUTE A MAGPIE PAST NOON THAN NOT
I DONT THINK YOU ARE
WE'VE BEEN OUR HOUSE FOR FIVE YEARS WE GET MAIL AND CALLS FOR THE TENANT BEFORE LAST AND THE PRIOR TENANT IT JUST SHOWS WHAT THEY CONSIDER IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO UPDATE
WE USED TO GET TWO CHRISTMAS CARDS EVERY YEAR FOR THE PREVIOUS OWNERS WE ALWAYS FORWARDED THEM AND ONE OF THEM CONTINUED FOR ABOUT YEARS IT WAS A BIT SAD BECAUSE THE WRITING WAS OLD FOLK WRITING WHICH BECAME MORE SHAKY AS THE YEARS WENT BY AND THEN STOPPED
I'VE LIVED IN PLACES FOR YEARS AND GOT POST FOR OTHER PEOPLE

IT'S FUNNY AT WORK MY BOSS GETS POST TO HIS HOUSE IN MY NAME AND WITH MANAGING DIRECTOR ON IT

I'VE BEEN INVITED TO SO MANY PORSCHE TEST DRIVES APPARENTLY
I MOVED INTO THIS FLAT YEARS AGO

I'M STILL GETTING MAIL FOR THE PREVIOUS TENANT
IF THE IS A RETURN ADDRESS CROSS OUT YOUR ADDRESS WRITE RTS ADDRESSEE NOT PRESENT

IT IT LACKS THAT THEN I GET INTO THE ISSUE OF NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPEN POST NOT ADDRESSED TO YOU BUT DO NOT WANT THE SENDER TO FEEL IGNORED NORMALLY DON'T HAVE FORWARDING ADDRESSES

ADMITTEDLY WHEN 2 POLICE OFFICERS SOMEONE FROM THE COUNCIL AND A BAILIFF TURNED UP I HAD TO PRODUCE ID THAT TO PROVE I WAS NOT THE PERSON THEY ARE LOOKING FOR HAD THE LETTERS
I'VE LIVED IN THIS HOUSE FOR YEARS NOW

THE PREVIOUS TENANTS WERE MORMONS BUT HE CARES SO MUCH ABOUT BEING A MORMON THAT HE HASN'T BOTHERED TO TELL THEM HE MOVED

BUT THE WORST PART IS THEY CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO UPDATE THEIR INFORMATION EITHER SO THEY KNOCK ON EVERY FEW FUCKING MONTHS ASKING FOR HIM
WE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR AND STILL GET POST FOR THEM I JUST CHUCK IT OUT NOW
I MOVED IN TWO YEARS AGO AND STILL GET STUFF FOR VARIOUS TENANTS I'VE STARTED BINNING IT
WHAT IF HE MISSES SOMETHING IMPORTANT

THAT'S HIS PROBLEM NOT YOURS IF HE HASN'T BEEN BOTHERED TO GET HIS POST FORWARDED BY THE POST OFFICE AND IS EXPECTING YOU TO DO IT FOR HIM WITHOUT EVEN ASKING WHETHER YOU WOULD MIND DOING IT THEN HE DESERVES TO MISS SOMETHING IMPORTANT

YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM JUST WRITE GONE AWAY ON ANY FUTURE LETTERS CROSS OUT THE ADDRESS AND PUT THEM BACK IN THE PILLAR BOX POST FOR HIM WILL THEN EVENTUALLY DRY UP
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER BOTH OF MY PARENTS HAVE ALWAYS MADE A KIND OF OOOOOOHFFFFHHHH NOISE FOLLOWED BY A WHISPERED THAT'S BETTER EVERY TIME THEY SIT DOWN I ALWAYS USED TO GET ANNOYED BY THIS BUT HAVE RECENTLY CAUGHT MYSELF DOING IT
JUST AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT ON A ROLLERCOASTER YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT
LOL
LET ME PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY YOU DON'T WANK TOO MUCH JUST TOO OFTEN AND FOR TOO LONG
WELL FOR NOW AT THE RIPE AGE OF THIS IS NOT YET A PROBLEM I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IF ANYTHING IT WOULD BE NICE TO NOT HAVE A RAGING BONER EVERYTIME I SIT DOWN AND RELAX
TWO QUESTIONS

IS IT A BISCUIT
DO I HAVE A CUP OF TEA

IF THE ANSWER TO BOTH QUESTIONS IS YES THEN INTO THE TEA IT GOES
YES
WELL WHY NOT
SURELY THAT DEBATE LASTED ALL OF SECONDS AS EVERYONE AROUND THE TABLE UNANIMOUSLY AGREED
APART FROM MONTY BURNS
WHEN ANSWERING I JUST SAY SPEAK IN AN INTIMIDATING COMMANDING THIS HAD BETTER BE GOOD TONE
YOU SAY WE
HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING BIG BANG THEORY
SPANIARDS ANSWER BY SAYING DAGAME WHICH LITERALLY TRANSLATES AS TELL ME OR SPEAK TO ME
HOW LONG DOES IT COUNT AS NEW UNTIL IT ISN'T NEW ANYMORE
HOW DUSTY IS YOUR WALLET

DO MOTHS EAT PLASTIC
I FUCKING HATE THOSE PLASTIC MONSTROSITIES THEY DON'T FOLD WELL AND ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO JUMP OUT OF MY WALLET
AT THE TOP OF OUR ROAD THERE'S A LARGE ROUNDABOUT AT A FOUR-WAY JUNCTION IF YOU ENTER FROM ONE PARTICULAR ROAD YOU BARELY HAVE TO TWITCH THE WHEEL TO TAKE THE NEXT EXIT I'D DESCRIBE THAT AS GOING STRAIGHT ACROSS BUT WE'VE HAD CABBIES GET QUITE IRATE THAT BECAUSE IT'S AT A BIT OF AN ANGLE YOU HAVE TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THEM AS TURN RIGHT

ROUNDABOUT ARE WEIRD

OR OUR CABBIES ARE WEIRD POSSIBLE
AS A PERSON NEWLY WORKING AND LIVING IN MILTON KEYNES I FEEL YOUR PAIN
AND WHILST IT IS DOING THAT PUTS AN ICON ON THE SCREEN FOR THE EXIT BEING TO THE RIGHT EVEN THOUGH ITS STRAIGHT ON THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COLONIALS WRITE NAVIGATION SOFTWARE
THAT'S WHEN YOU START A RAVE
SIMILARLY WHEN VEHICLES ALL APPROACH A MINI ROUNDABOUT AT THE SAME TIME AND NOBODY HAS THE AUDACITY TO GO FIRST
ENGINE OFF I WILL BE THE MOST NICE PERSON HERE DAMN YOU
THE NEXT THING THAT SOMETIMES HAPPENS IS THAT YOU BOTH FLASH AGAIN AT THE SAME TIME A VERY AWKWARD SITUATION TO GET OUT OF
OR THE OTHER IS WHEN YOU GET A CAR ARRIVING AT EVERY ENTRY TO A MINI ROUNDABOUT AT THE SAME TIME

EDIT CRAP WASN'T THE FIRST PERSON TO THINK OF THAT MUST REMEMBER TO READ COMMENTS FIRST
PLEASE TRY TO GET OUT OF THE HABIT OF FLASHING PEOPLE TO LET THEM PAST IT'S UNNECESSARY IT CAUSES CONFUSION IT CAN BE DANGEROUS TO OTHER ROAD USERS DUE TO IT CHANGING THE PREDICTABILITY OF THE SITUATION AND AT NIGHT IT'S RATHER BLINDING IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO LET SOMEONE THROUGH JUST STOP THEY'LL GET THE MESSAGE
I ALWAYS GO FIRST IN THAT SITUATION SOMEONE NEEDS TO MAKE THE MOVE AND IT MIGHT AS WELL BE ME

WHAT IS ANNOYING ME MORE AT THE MOMENT IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WON'T PULL OUT UNTIL SOMEONE FLASHES THEIR LIGHTS AND GESTURES TO THEM YOU COULD LEAVE THESE PEOPLE A GAP A MILE LONG AND THEY JUST WON'T MOVE OFF ON THEIR OWN

WHAT IS THIS
DINOSAUR BURGERS
CAVEMEN ALSO DIDN'T NEED FINANCIAL SERVICES

IF YOU'RE DELAYED BY MORE THAN MINUTES THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLAIM COMPENSATION I GOT A REFUND BECAUSE THEY CANCELLED MY TRAIN A FEW WEEKS AGO FOR ANYTHING OVER AN HOUR YOU'RE MEANT TO GET BACK
YOU CAN'T RESCHEDULE A TRAIN

I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL MATE IT HAPPENED TO ME AND I BRIEFLY THOUGHT I WAS IN SYRIA
THERE'S USUALLY A SMALL LULL THEN THE FUCKERS START GETTING FESTIVE A MONTH EARLY I MIGHT GET INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE NIGHTLY SOUND ASSAULT DIG A HOLE IN THE BACK GARDEN SIT IN IT EATING OUT OF THE TIN SMOKING A WOODBINE WRITING A LETTER

DEAR BESSIE

GERRY AIN'T ALF GETTING BUSY WITH HIS FIFTEEN POUND GUNS THIS AVENIN SOUNDS LIKE GUY FAWKES NIGHT ERE IN WIPERS IT DOES
I DON'T KNOW IF I FEEL SAD OR HAPPY PEOPLE AROUND HERE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER WITH BONFIRE NIGHT THE LOCAL CHADS SEEMED TO HAVE QUIT USING FIREWORKS
ITS THE SPANISH ALWAYS BLAME THE SPANISH
ON SUNDAY JUST GONE SOMEONE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA TO SET OFF A FIREWORKS DISPLAY AT QUARTER TO IN THE MORNING JUST AS I WAS TOLD A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY HAD JUST PASSED AWAY
I'M JUST SERVING SOMEONE ELSE THEN I'LL

WHENEVER YOU'VE GOT A MINUTE LOVE
IT'S ALWAYS SOME CUNT WHO'S JUST GOT TO THE BAR AND GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN YOU POINT OUT YOU'RE ALREADY SERVING SOMEONE
SOMETIMES I TRY TO ORDER WHEN THE BARTENDER IS ALREADY IN THE MIDDLE OF SERVING SOMEONE BUT I HAVEN'T REALISED MOST EMBARRASSING THING EVER
I ALWAYS HATE WHEN THE MILLING AROUND AND NOT SERVING PEOPLE I FEEL LIKE A TWAT IF I SAID SOMETHING AND IT'S NOT MY LOCAL
THE ONLY THING THAT ANNOYED ME WHEN I WORKED IN A PUB WAS WHEN SOMEONE ORDERED DRINKS FOR A LARGE GROUP AND THE LAST DRINK ON THE LIST WAS A GUINESS OTHERWISE I JUST IGNORED THEIR REMARKS
I AM VISIBLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I WASH MY HANDS AND THEN FIND A DRYER THAT DOESN'T WANT TO FLAY MY SKIN FROM MY BONES
THAT JOY WHEN YOU NOTICE THE PUBLIC TOILETS YOU ARE USING HAVE THEM DYSON HAND DRIERS INSTALLED
MY USUAL COURSE OF ACTION IS TO SIGH AUDIBLY AND FROWN AT MY HANDS TO SHOW THOSE WAITING WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE THAT AND TO JUST WALK AWAY AND WIPE MY DAMP HANDS AGAINST MY CLOTHES ANYWAY
THE TITLE OF YOUR POST MAKES IT SOUND LIKE YOU'RE TYPING THIS WITH ONE HAND AND TRYING TO DRY THE OTHER MAYBE MULTI TASKING ISN'T YOUR STRONG SUIT
I ONLY FOUND OUT A FEW YEARS AGO

YOUR MEANT TO RUB YOUR HANDS QUITE FAST WHILE DRYING THEM UNDER THE HAND DRYER THE REST IS UP TO THE HEAT ANGLE OF AIR

DO NOT FEEL BAD IF IT TAKES LONGER THAN ITS THE FACILITIES SKIMPING ON GETTING A DECENT PRODUCT
AW THIS HAPPENED TO ME TODAY

I WAS DRYING MY HANDS WHEN OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SEE Q GUY WASHING HIS HANDS TURN TOWARDS THE DRYER SEE ME THEN TURN BACK AND PRETEND TO GO WASH HIS HANDS AGAIN

NEEDLESS TO SAY I STILL HAD WET HANDS WHEN I LEFT
THIS VIDEO CHANGED MY LIFE

TL W SHAKE YOUR HANDS VIGOROUSLY ABOUT TIMES AND MOST OF THE WATER FLIES OFF THIS DRAMATICALLY CUTS DOWN ON DRYING TIME WITH A PAPER TOWEL OR HAND DRIER
WE HAVE THE T SHAPED DYSON ONES IN WORK IT'S LIKE STICKING YOUR HANDS UNDER A JET ENGINE
I JUST USE BOG ROLL EVEN IF THEY HAVE HAND DRYERS
MAYBE BECAUSE THAT SQUIRTY SOAP TENDS TO REMOVE THE NATURAL OILS IN YOUR SKIN AND THUS LETS YOUR HANDS GET WETTER THAN THEY NORMALLY WOULD WITH A BLOCK OF CARBOLIC
I HAVE STOPPED USING ANYTHING THAT DOESNT HAVE A JET ENGINE BUILT INTO IT THOSE SLOW HAND DRYER ARE MAINLY HAND WARMER AND I DONT NEED SUCH THING IT'S QUICKER TO NICK SOME LOO ROLL TO DRY MY HAND INSTEAD
I WORK AT A PLACE THAT HAS HAD SOME KIND OF ECO AWARD THE HAND DRYERS MUST ONLY BE ABOUT WATTS THE MOST UNPLEASANT THING THOUGH IS THE STENCH OF THE WATERLESS URINALS IN JULY AND AUGUST
DON'T YOU KNOW HOW HAND DRIERS WORK

THEY BLOW JUST ENOUGH AIR AT YOUR HANDS TO MAKE THEM COLD AND THEN YOU PUT YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS ON THE WAY OUT TO DRY THEM
MY LOCAL CINEMA HAS THE WORST HAND DRIERS THE FORCE OF AIR IS WEAK LIKE A SQUIRREL TRYING TO INFLATE A BALLOON BUT IT APPEARS TO BE CONFIGURED AS MORE OF AN OVEN SO THE LITTLE AIR IT DOES SPOUT OUT IS AT ABOUT THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF THE SUN THIS MEANS THAT YOU CAN ONLY HOLD YOUR HAND UNDER IT FOR A FEW SECONDS AT A TIME BUT BECAUSE THEY AIR IS SO WEAK YOU REALLY NEED TO HOLD YOUR HANDS UNDER THERE FOR LONGER THAN A NORMAL MACHINE AND THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE TRYING TO EAT OVERPRICED POPCORN WITH SLIGHTLY MOIST HANDS
I LIKE TO GET A WAD OF TISSUE AND TRY MY HANDS WITH IT WHILE UNDER THE DRYER WORKS GREAT
GOOD OLD BACK OF JEANS PAT DOWN
CORNFLAKES NO WONDER THEY'RE CHEAP
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE FOR MUMS AND DADS TO POUR IF YOU LET KIDS POUR OUT THEIR OWN CEREAL THEY'LL OVERFILL THE BOWL AND POUR HALF OF THEM ON THE TABLE THAT BOX HAS GOT TO LAST THE FAMILY A WHOLE WEEK YOU KNOW

PEOPLE WATCH TV STILL HOW DO CHILDREN KNOW WHAT A AUDSLEY IS

MAH HA HA TAKE THAT CUSTOMERS
KEEP IT AND FRAME IT IN A FEW DECADES IT COULD BE WORTH WELL PROBABLY
OLD FIVERS STILL EXIST
I'M ACTUALLY REALLY IMPRESSED WITH HOW FAST THE NEW ONES ARE GETTING IN CIRCULATION I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN OLD ONE IN WEEKS
I WORK IN A SHOP AND THE OLD PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME FOR AN OLD FIVER AND I SMUGLY SAY IN MY HEAD THEY'LL ALL BE CHANGING SOON
I HATE THE NEW ONES
I GOT MY FIRST OLD FIVER IN WEEKS THIS MORNING AND I'M SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING RETIRING IT BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY MY LAST ONE
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

THIS JUST NOW I SOLDIERED ON AND TRIED IT AGAIN RESULT

ALSO IT WAS A SELF SERVE CHECKOUT NO DISAPPROVING LOOK TO BE HAD
COFFEE SHOP AT WORK ALWAYS ASK ME TO PAY BUT THEY NEVER PUT THE CARD READER IN THE MODE WHERE IT'S READY TO ACCEPT A CARD CONTACTLESS OR APPLE ANDROID PAY MEANS I'M LEFT THERE STANDING LIKE A LEMON THEN IT EVENTUALLY FAILS ON OCCASION ANYWAY SO I LOOK LIKE A BIGGER DICK
THIS HAPPENED TO ME ON THE BUS LAST WEEK NOBODY WAS HAPPY ABOUT IT
I DON'T GET THIS FASCINATION WITH PAYING WITH YOUR PHONE WHEN IT'S SIMPLE AND NEVER FAILS WITH CONTACTLESS
MY GIRLFRIEND HAS AN OLD DEBIT CARD WITHOUT CONTACTLESS AND AT TIMES I FORGET AND TRY TO USE THE CONTACTLESS FEATURE ABOUT TIMES BEFORE I REALISE IT ISN'T CONTACTLESS I'VE HAD SOME WEIRD LOOKS
SEPTEMBER IS THE 9TH MONTH JUST FYI
FUCK YEAH I'M WITH YOU DAMN THOSE WEIRD AMERICAN IMPERIALISTS AND THEIR CULTURAL PROPAGANDA TRYING TO MAKE THE REST OF THE WORLD GET USED TO WEIRD DATES LIKE WE'RE NOT THE PROBLEM UNCLE SAM YOU ARE
THEY COULD SOLVE THIS BY MAKING EVERY RELEASE DATE BE THE SAME AS THE MONTH NUMBER
DON'T WORRY I'VE HAD PLENTY OF PEOPLE MOVE AWAY FROM ME ON THE TRAIN WHEN A SEAT OPENS UP

STORY
MY PARENTS MOVE TO LLANDUDNO THEY WERE SURPRISED IT RAINS SO MUCH

BUT IT'S A HOLIDAY TOWN

YES MUM TEN MILES FROM SNOWDEN THE RAINIEST PLACE IN EUROPE

A TOUCHSCREEN THAT HUNDREDS OF OTHER ILL PEOPLE HAVE TOUCHED IS ONE OF THE LAST THINGS I WANT TO TOUCH AND IF I'M VISITING THE DOCTOR THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT I'M ILL MYSELF AND THEREFORE WILL HAVE A SLIGHTLY WEAKER IMMUNE SYSTEM

IT'S ALWAYS STRUCK ME AS A BIT ODD THAT THEY INSIST ON MAKING YOU USE A TOUCHSCREEN TO CHECK IN
THE ONES ARE MY DOCTORS ARE BROKE OF THE TIME ANYWAY
I'D LOVE AN AUTOMATED CHECK IN MACHINE AT MY DOCTORS THE WOMEN THAT WORK BEHIND THE DESK WORK AT A PACE THAT EVEN A SNAIL WOULD CONSIDER SLOW
ON MY VERY INFREQUENT GP VISITS I'VE FOUND THE AUTOMATED CHECK IN SYSTEM WE HAVE DOESN'T SEEM TO FIND ME
HOW DARE YOU INTERRUPT THE BUSY RECEPTIONISTS TALKING ABOUT EACH OTHERS PROBLEMS
TO BE FAIR TO THE RECEPTIONIST THEY WERE PROBABLY ANNOYED AT BEING OVERWORKED UNDERPAID AND UNFAIRLY HATED BY THE PUBLIC

MY MUM WORKS AS ONE TRIES TO BE AS CORDIAL AS POSSIBLE AT ALL TIMES BUT HAS ONCE HAD TO SIT ON THE FRONT DESK BOOKING APPOINTMENTS ANSWERING PHONES AND OTHER THINGS ALL AT ONCE WHILE THE ONLY OTHER RECEPTIONIST WORKING THAT DAY WAS IN THE BACK OFFICE PRINTING OFF PRESCRIPTIONS
AS A CYCLIST NOTHING PISSES ME OFF MORE THAN SEEING PEOPLE WITHOUT ARE NOT EXPENSIVE QUID WILL GET YOU SEEN TOP THAT OFF WITH A HIGH VIS VEST FOR A FEW QUID AND YOU ARE LIT UP ENOUGH FOR ANYONE TO SEE WORK HAS BANNED PEOPLE FROM CYCLING ON SITE WITHOUT LIGHTS IF ITS JUST FUCKING STUPID MAN WOULD YOU DRIVE WITHOUT LIGHTS
GIVE IT A WEEK AND THE LIGHT FROM THE CANDLES REFLECTING OFF THE CELLOPHANE ROUND THE FLOWERS TAPED TO EVERY OTHER LAMP POST SHOULD ILLUMINATE THE ROAD WELL ENOUGH TO SEE THEM BEFORE YOU HIT THEM
I PERSONALLY FIND THOSE FLASHING LEDS A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO JUDGE DISTANCE THAN A CONSTANT LIT ONE
2 LIGHTS FRONT AN REAR IS MY MINIMUM SETUP AFTER DARK YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN ONE MIGHT FAIL OR FALL OFFICIAL STILL DOESN'T STOP BELLENDS IN WHITE RANGE ROVERS SKIMMING PAST WITH A FEW INCHES TO SPARE
I WAS GUILTY OF THIS I USED TO TRAVEL HOME AFTER A NIGHT SHIFT AT ABOUT ON DARK COUNTRY LANES LOOKING BACK I'M SHOCKED THAT I'M STILL HERE
I'M SORRY FOR MY PAVEMENT RIDING RED LIGHT SKIPPING NO LIGHT HAVING BRETHREN

I CARE A LOT FAR FAR TOO MUCH IN FACT ABOUT MY BIKE'S LIGHT SETUP I'M ALWAYS WORRYING IF I CAN BE SEEN AND WILL WORRY NO END IF I DON'T HAVE 2 GOOD REAR LIGHTS STATIC RATHER THAN FLASHING AND THEN OF COURSE WHERE I SHOULD APPLY REFLECTIVE TAPE

ANYWAY IT BLOWS MY MIND THAT ANYONE COULD RIDE ON THE ROAD WITH NO LIGHTS I ALWAYS LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE KILLED SOON ENOUGH
AS A MOTORCYCLIST I FEEL STRANGELY PROTECTIVE OF CYCLISTS I'LL HAPPILY BLOCK A TWAT FROM OVERTAKING THEM IN A STUPID PLACE BUT FFS MAKE YOURSELVES VISIBLE MY S HEADLIGHT IS VERY UNDERPOWERED AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE YOU UNTIL I'M UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE
MIND THE CYCLIST RICHARD
I THINK SOME PEOPLE JUST HAVE A DEATHWISH I MEAN SURE IT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE THAT YOU CAN CYCLE ALONG IN THE DARK WITH NO LIGHTS A LIT CIGARETTE TALKING ON YOUR PHONE AND BALANCING WHAT I ASSUME IS A BAG OF GOLF CLUBS ACROSS THE HANDLEBARS BUT FOR SAKE GO AND DO IT IN A CIRCUS RATHER THAN WOBBLING DOWN THE CYCLEPATH TOWARDS ME
THE FACT THAT BLACK HIGH VIS CYCLIST GEAR IS POPULAR BOGGLES MY MIND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT STUFF WITH THICK REFLECTIVE STRIPES LIKE YOU SEE ON HIGH VIS VESTS I'M TALKING ABOUT BOWELS OF THE EARTH BLACK WITH REFLECTIVE ZIPS MAYBE JUST MAYBE SOME REFLECTIVE PIPING HIDDEN SOMEWHERE
I WONDER IF IT'S A LOAD OF PEOPLE THINKING OH SHIT CHRISTMAS IS COMING AND I NEED TO SAVE MONEY I'LL CYCLE TO WORK USING THAT DUSTY YEAR OLD BIKE I HAVEN'T TOUCHED SINCE AND YOU CAN FUCK OFF IF YOU THINK I'M SPENDING IN SPORTS DIRECT ON SOMETHING REFLECTIVE
ALSO THE ONES ON UNLIT ROADS WITH THE FLASHING NOW YOU SEE ME NOW YOU DON'T I NEED EXCELLENT NIGHT VISION BECAUSE THESE ARE USELESS FOR SHOWING THE ROAD AHEAD LIGHTS

FOR GODS SAKE IF FLASHING HEADLIGHTS WERE AN AID TO SEEING WHERE YOU WERE GOING IT'D BE MANDATORY FOR CARS TO HAVE THEM

IS IT ILLEGAL TO RIDE A BICYCLE ON AN UNLIT ROAD AT NIGHT WITHOUT LIGHTS

UNDER RULES FOR CYCLISTS TO OF THE HIGHWAY CODE IT SAYS THESE RULES ARE IN ADDITION TO THOSE IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS WHICH APPLY TO ALL VEHICLES EXCEPT THE MOTORWAY SECTION

THEN RULE OF LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS RULES TO STATES THAT YOU MUST USE HEADLIGHTS AT NIGHT EXCEPT ON A ROAD WHICH HAS LIT STREET LIGHTING THESE ROADS ARE GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO A SPEED LIMIT OF MPH KM H UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED AND USE HEADLIGHTS WHEN VISIBILITY IS SERIOUSLY REDUCED

AS I UNDERSTAND IT ANYTHING IN THE HIGHWAY CODE THAT SAYS MUST OR MUST NOT IS A LEGAL REQUIREMENT SO IT'S ILLEGAL TO RIDE A BICYCLE ON AN UNLIT ROAD AT NIGHT WITHOUT LIGHTS
WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE A JET BLACK COAT A WOMAN WEARING A BLACK COAT WITH A BLACK HOOD UP BLACK TROUSERS AND BLACK SHOES SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME WHEN SHE DIDN'T LOOK WHEN CROSSING

PEDESTRIANS SHOULD BE FORCED TO WEAR
DELETED
THIS THREAD MADE ME GO OUT AND BUY LIGHTS AND A HELMET TODAY THANKS FOR THE IMPETUS
THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I'VE TURNED AROUND A BLIND BEND TO GET OUT OF MY ESTATE TO FIND A BUNCH OF KIDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD IN DARK CLOTHES JUST INFURIATES ME NEARLY HIT THEM ON BONFIRE NIGHT WHILST THEY WERE ALL IN THE ROAD TRYING TO THROW FIREWORKS AT CARS MAYBE I SHOULD DO EVERYONE A FAVOUR AND MOW THEM DOWN NEXT TIME HEHE
YEP I CYCLE BACK FROM MY UNIVERSITY CAMPUS ALONG A SHARED CYCLE LANE PAVEMENT SO LIGHTS WOULD SEEM LESS IMPORTANT NEARLY CRASHED IN TO THE BACK OF SOMEONE GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION YESTERDAY AS VISIBILITY WAS SO BAD DESPITE HAVING LIGHTS ON MYSELF I COULD BARELY SEE A BIKE A METRE IN FRONT OF ME
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A WRITING PROMPT FOR A MISERABLE DYSTOPIAN FUTURE
YEP DRIVING HOME LAST NIGHT ONE KID ON PATH ONE ON ROAD BOTH WITHOUT LIGHTS ONLY SAW THE ROAD ONE AT LAST MINUTE AS WELL
BUT I SPENT ON THIS BLACK JAPHA KIT
IT ALSO COINCIDES WITH EVERY CAR HEADLIGHT BEING SET TO A COMPLETELY RANDOM BRIGHTNESS LEVEL
I'M GLAD CAR DRIVERS FINALLY START TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND WHAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THEIR METAL BOX
AS A PEDESTRIAN IT DOES SEEM THAT CYCLISTS DONT EXIST IN OUR 3D WORLD BUT SOME ALTERNATIVE DIMENSION THAT WHEN YOU'RE CROSSING THE ROAD ON A GREEN MANUAL


OR THEY COME BEHIND CARS WAITING ON A RED AND GO RIGHT THROUGH AS YOU'RE CROSSING
I AM ONE OF THOSE I ORDERED A SET OF LIGHT FROM AMAZON WHICH WAS DELIVERED AT THE NEIGHBOURS WHO SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED ON HOLIDAY OR SOMETHING FORTUNATELY ALMOST ALL OF MY ROUTE IS ON DEDICATED CYCLE PATHS AWAY FROM CARS
I WAS ONE OF THESE PEOPLE BUT THIS YEAR I HAVE INVESTED A FAIR BIT INTO NEW HIGH VIS GEAR NEW HELMET BRIGHTER LIGHTS HIGH VIS RAIN JACKET AND GLOVES I FEEL A BIT STUPID WEARING THEM BUT I'M GETTING USED TO IT AND AT LEAST I CAN FEEL SAFER WEARING IT
I USED TO RIDE AROUND BUCKINGHAM PALACE AFTER DARK FOR SOME REASONS THERE ARE BARELY ANY LIGHTS AROUND THERE I GUESS LIZZIE WANTS TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE HANGING OUT IN THAT AREA AND I ALSO GOT RUN OVER ONCE LUCKY ESCAPE THAT WAS

SO I KITTED OUT MY BIKE WITH REFLECTIVE TAPE INCLUDING ON THE SPOKES APPARENTLY THE MOST ACCIDENTS INVOLVING BIKES HAVE THEM HIT FROM THE SIDES GOT MYSELF ONE OF THOSE REFLECTIVE RUCKSACK COVERS EXTRA LIGHTS ON THE HELMET AND SMALL EXTRA USB CHARGEABLE LIGHTS HANGING FROM HANDLEBAR AND SPARE LIGHTS AT HOME BECAUSE LIGHTS ARE FLIMSY AND BATTERIES RUN OUT EASILY SO THERE ARE GOING TO BE TIMES WHEN I'LL BE RIDING WITHOUT MAIN LIGHTS
YOU DON'T LIVE NEAR CAMBRIDGE WHERE CYCLISTS RIDE WITHOUT LIGHTS AT ALL YEAR ROUND
I SAW A LAD ALL IN BLACK NO LIGHTS NO HELMET RIDING ON THE LEAF COVERED PAVEMENT FALL OFF IN FRONT OF ME I CHEERED INSIDE
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY LIGHTS OR HOW MUCH YOU WEAR SOMEONE OUT THERE WILL STILL FEEL IT NECESSARY TO KNOCK YOU DOWN FOR NO REASON
THAT'S BAD ENOUGH IT IT'S THE ONES WITH OVERLY BRIGHT FLASHING FRONT LIGHTS THAT REALLY PISS ME OFF WHEN THEY ARE ALMOST BLINDING ME IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR THEY SHOULD BE BANNED AS THEY ARE LIKELY TO TRIGGER MIGRAINE AND POSSIBLY EPILEPSY DUE TO THE QUICK FLASHING
ME AND THE WIFE HAVE A THING WHERE WE WIND DOWN OUR CAR WINDOW AND SHOUT WHERE ARE YOU AT CYCLISTS WHO DON'T HAVE LIGHTS WE HOPE OUR QUESTION CONFUSES THEM ENOUGH TO GET LIGHTS WE THINK WE'RE HILARIOUS
NO LIGHTS NO HIGH VISIBILITY JACKET AND NO HELMET ASKING TO BE RAN OVER SOME MIGHT SAY I'VE SEEN CARS ALMOST HIT OTHER DRIVERS BECAUSE THEY'VE SWERVED LAST MINUTE TO AVOID A CYCLIST THEY HADN'T SEEN I SEE CYCLISTS WEARING MOSTLY DARK CLOTHES AT NIGHT WITHOUT ANY LIGHTS ON A BUSY A ROAD
I HATE THAT ADVERTISEMENT SLIGHTLY HYPOCRITICAL OF TO MAKE AN ADVERT ABOUT HOW WORK GETS IN THE WAY OF FAMILY AT CHRISTMAS AND YET I'M PRETTY SURE THEIR STORES WILL BE OPEN ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND BOXING DAY
HE WAS ALREADY SHIPPED OFF TO THE STATES HE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED HERE
AND THE SONG JUST GOES ON AND ON
HE'S THE WORST MAN ALIVE
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT ADVERT I GET THE IDEA BUT THE DAD ISN'T EVEN MAKING MEMORIES WITH HIS FAMILY COS HE'S GETTING CLONE TO DO IT
SURELY THAT MUST BE SOME SORT OF TESCO FALSE FLAG ADVERTISEMENT
WELL I HOPE HE GETS SEASONAL DEPRESSION AFTER THE HOLIDAYS AND TAKES HIS OWN LIFE
FOR SOME REASON I DIDN'T REALISE IT WAS BORDEN I THOUGHT IT WAS THE ONE FROM SCOUTING FOR GIRLS
UGH MY MOTHER WHO WORKS AT HAD THAT BLOODY THING ON REPEAT THE OTHER DAY
OH DEAR OH DEAR OH DEAR
OR IF THEY TAKE OR SOMETHING DO THEY HAVE TO PAY IT BACK
SO FIRST PEOPLE HE CAUGHT 4TH PERSON GETS ON CASH BUILDER PICKS FOR THE CHASE BUT THEN GETS THROUGH I NEED TO KNOW NOW
IF THEY ALL GET KNOCKED OUT THEY CHOOSE ONE OF THEIR NUMBER TO DO A SOLO FINAL CHASE FOR A SET AMOUNT I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH WHICH THEY THEN SHARE IF WON TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO FAILED SOLOIST HAS WON
SHOULD HAVE BAGPIPED IT QUICKER
I TRIED TO HELP YOU REAP THE KARMA TRAIN
I DID THAT ONCE BY ACCIDENT I WAS IN A TRAIN WAITING ROOM AND SOMEONES PHONE ALARM HAD GONE OFF IT WAS ABOUT AND I WAS LIKE DAMN JUST TURN THAT OFF TURNS OUT IT WAS MY ALARM COMING THROUGH MY HEADPHONES
NEVER MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH ANY OF THE OTHER PASSENGERS

LIKE ANYONE EVER INTENTIONALLY MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH A STRANGER ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT
NOT QUITE AS BAD BUT STOOD IN A SHOP OVER A COUPLE OF HOURS I COULD FAINTLY HEAR MUSIC

OTHERS COULD HEAR IT YET NO ONE WAS UPSTAIRS WITH STEREO ON KEPT ASKING FOLK EVEN ODD CUSTOMER OR TWO IF THEY COULD HEAR IT

COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING IN THE SHOP THAT PLAYED MUSIC

I EVENTUALLY REALISED MY PLAYER HAD TURNED ITSELF ON FOR SOME REASON WAS CHIRPING AWAY QUIETLY IN MY OWN DAMNED POCKET LOL

THAT'S QUITE AMUSING
IT S GOOD TO HAVE LIFE GOALS
I ONCE HAD TO FORCE A BUS DRIVER TO TAKE A TWENTY POUND NOTE

ON THE WAY TO WORK WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN BUSES WERE MY ONLY OPTION WENT TO THE CASH POINT IT INFORMED ME THAT IT ONLY HAD TWENTIES NO SHOPS WERE OPEN AT THAT TIME SO I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO USE THE TWENTY

BUS TURNED UP MINUTES LATE I OFFERED THE TWENTY WITH AN APOLOGY THE DRIVER REFUSED AS HE HAD NO CHANGE ALTHOUGH I HAD SEEN ENOUGH CHANGE APPEAR FROM THE PASSENGERS AHEAD OF ME AT THE BUS STOP SO I WENT UN BRITISH

TOLD THE BUS DRIVER THAT'S FINE YOU'LL HAVE ENOUGH BY THE TIME WE GET TO TOWN I'LL PAY THEN AND PROCEEDED TO SIT DOWN

HE THEN LEFT HIS AIR LOCK AND STARTED SHOUTING AT ME THAT HE WASN'T LEAVING THE STOP UNTIL I PAID I OFFERED THE TWENTY AGAIN

EVENTUALLY ALL THE OTHER PASSENGERS TOLD HIM TO EITHER TAKE THE TWENTY OR LET ME PAY AT THE END

TURNS OUT HE DID HAVE CHANGE BEST BUS JOURNEY OF MY LIFE
STORY TIME

I NORMALLY CYCLE BUT NEEDED TO BUS IT AS MY BIKE WAS BEING REPAIRED BY THE EVER INCOMPETENT AT HALFORD

THE ONLY CASH I HAD ON ME WAS A NOTE I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THIS AS I AM SURE YOU ARE ALL WELL AWARE BUS DRIVERS AND PAPER MONEY GO TOGETHER LIKE TOOTHPASTE AND TROPICANA

MY ARRIA BUS ARRIVED IN A VERY REASONABLE MINUTES LATER THAN SCHEDULED I BOARDED AND ASK THE DRIVER FOR A SINGLE TO THE LOCAL TRAIN STATION FOUR FIFTY GRUNTED THE DRIVER

I'M REALLY SORRY MATE THIS IS THE SMALLEST I'VE GOT PRESENTING MY NOTE

SORRY MATE CAN'T TAKE UM

I ASKED WHY

THE GENTLEMAN DRIVER PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT ARRIA WOULD NOT SUPPLY HIM WITH THE PEN REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE THE NOTE WAS GENUINE AND ANY COUNTERFEIT NOTES FOUND WOULD BE DEDUCTED FROM THE DRIVERS SALARY

THERE WAS A QUEUE BEHIND ME AND NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS AN HOUR LATE FOR WORK

GIVEN MY LIMITED INTERACTION WITH THE COMPANY I MUST AGREE THEY ARE ALL CUNTS


WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR BUS DOESN'T SHOW UP

CRY ARRIA
FOR ME ARRIA TEND TO BE THE MORE RELIABLE AND FRIENDLY WEST MIDLANDS TRAVEL ARE THE WORST AND SEEM TO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO FUCK THINGS UP
WAS IN SELBY TODAY SOMEONE ELSE WITH US HAD HEARD THE DRIVERS SAYING THEY PLAN ON DOING MORE LIGHTNING SHORT NOTICE STRIKES TOO
MOVED TO AN AREA SERVICED BY ARRIA BUSSES TWO AND A HALF MONTHS AGO I USE THEIR BUSSES ABOUT OR TIMES A WEEK AND I CANNOT RECALL A SINGLE TIME WHEN THE BUS WAS ON TIME I'D ESTIMATE OF THE TIME THE BUS IS AT LEAST MINUTES LATE OF THE TIME IT'S AT LEAST MINUTES LATE AND OF THE TIME IT NEVER APPEARS IS SO LATE IT'S BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THE NEXT BUS
AND A TWAT
HERE HERE
ARRIA WE'RE THE MAIN MOTIVATION FOR LEARNING TO DRIVE

A SERVICE THAT IS MEANT TO BE EVERY MINS WOULD USUALLY END IN WAITING MINS EVERY MORNING WHEN WALKING WOULD TAKE JUST AS LONG
AS AN EXPERIMENT FOR A WEEK I WALKED TO BUS ROUTE AND WOULD JUMP ON THE BUS WHEN IT ARRIVED AT WHATEVER POINT ON THE WALK I WAS AT THAT POINT IN TIME STOPS WERE FAIRLY CLOSE TOGETHER ON ROUTE SO NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS THE BUS IF YOU LOOK BACK DOWN THE ROAD AT EACH STOP THE IDEA BEING THE SHORTER JOURNEY WOULD BE CHEAPER IF I GOT IN FURTHER ON THE ROUTE WELL FOR THAT WEEK ENDED UP WALKING THE ENTIRE ROUTE DAILY WITHOUT SEEING THE BUS SO SAVED A LOT OF MONEY THAT WEEK

WITH THE PAYING WITH NOTES THING A DAY TICKET IN MY AREA IS AND OFTEN THE ONLY WAY I CAN PAY WOULD BE WITH A FIVER ALMOST EVERY TIME THE DRIVER WOULD COMPLAIN THAT I COULDN'T PAY WITH THE FIVER

NOW I'M DRIVING NOT ONLY SO I MAKE IT TO PLACES ON TIME ALMOST ALL THE TIME IT'S ALSO SAVING ME MONEY WITH FUEL AND INSURANCE COSTING ME LESS THAN BUS TRAVEL
SPEAKING AS SOMEONE WHO WAS GIVEN A FREE RIDE SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CHANGE TO GIVE THE EXACT FARE I WOULD HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO KNOW THE FARE WAS A FOUR-WEEK BUS PASS THAT I DID ACTUALLY BUY ON THE RETURN TRIP

WHILE I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT THE TIMING OF THE BUSES IS ABSOLUTELY SHIT AT TIMES MOST OF THE ARRIA BUS DRIVERS I'VE DEALT WITH SO FAR HAVE BEEN PRETTY REASONABLE MAYBE IT'S JUST A REGIONAL THING
I ACTUALLY HAD AN ARRIA DRIVER ACKNOWLEDGE MY EXISTENCE TODAY I WAS AMAZED TO HAVE MADE SUCH A BREAKTHROUGH
DIFFICULT SITUATION IT'S WORTH BUTTING IN THOUGH TO SAVE HAVING TO PHONE THEM AGAIN
I ONLY HAVE WITHOUT CONTACTLESS
I REFUSED CONTACTLESS WHEN MY BANK TRIED TO GIVE ME ONE MY WALLET'S ALREADY BRIMMING WITH SMARTCARDS I DON'T NEED ANOTHER ONE TO CONFUSE CARD READERS PLUS I'M A PARANOID BASTARD COMES WITH THE TRADE ANY FORM OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS GIVES ME THE WILLIES
I STILL USE CASH CARDS ARE FOR SHANDY DRINKERS
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL AND EXCITEMENT WITH CONTACTLESS I JUST USE CHIP AND PIN ISN'T THERE SOME REALLY LOW MAX AMOUNT YOU CAN SPEND CONTACTLESS I JUST DON'T GET WHY PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THE SYSTEM IS IN SOME WAY AMAZING OR SUPERIOR TO OTHERS WHAT AM I MISSING
IF THE GATE HAD BEEN IN THE FRIDGE NO GETTING THROUGH IT
JUST FOR FUTURE REFERENCE WATERGATE WAS A HOTEL NOT A DAM
WATER
TRY BEING FROM GLASGOW

OH GLASGOW ARE YOU FOR RANGERS OR CELTIC

REALLY MATE YOU WANT TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD
TRY SUPPORTING A FOREIGN TEAM AS A BRIT AND THEN HAVING TO EXPLAIN FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME THAT NO I DON'T FOLLOW ENGLISH BRITISH FOOTIE AT ALL

DYNAMO ZAGREB IS MY TEAM FYI
WORST IS WHEN YOU SAY WEST BROMWICH ALBION AND THEY REPLY NO I DON'T KNOW IT MANCHESTER AND THEN YOU GO YEAH MAN CTD THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THEM
BEING FROM LEICESTER AND EXPLAINING NO I DON'T LIKE RUGBY OR FOOTBALL
ITS THE SAME ANSWER AS WHEN THEY ASK YOU WHERE YOU LIVE
AND THERE'S ALWAYS AT LEAST A FOOT CLEARANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PERSON USING IT SO AS NOT TO LOOK LIKE A SLIMY FRAUDSTER AND OR ARMED THUG
KNOWING YOU'RE NEXT BUT HESITATING TILL SOMEONE ACTUALLY SAYS YOU'RE NEXT
FOR ANYONE WHO DOESN'T GET THE REFERENCE
ALL THESE YEARS LATER AND I STILL DO THIS TOO THAT'S PROPER MARKETING FOR YOU
THANK YOU VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH
YOU'RE AT LEAST WHAT YEARS OF AGE I STILL REMEMBER THAT ADVERT WELL AND MY PARTNER WHO IS YEARS YOUNGER THAN I AM DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE WHEN I REFERENCE IT
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS ABOUT CAN SOMEONE HELP
REPLACES FOR YOUR BRAINTREE IRON IN THE ORIGINAL A LINE I NEVER UNDERSTOOD AT ALL

SHITHEAD OF A SHOW
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE SOME BIG AND POPULAR
AND THEN I HEARD THAT THE MAIN ACT WAS GOING TO BE ELO
I SWEAR THE BBC ARE BANK ROLLING HIM THESE DAYS
THANKS FOR MAKING ME REALISE THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO THINKS CHRIS EVANS IS ALWAYS BANGING ON ABOUT LAVISH LIFESTYLES AS IF THEY ARE THE NORM THE AIN AUCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE PINNACLE OF THIS HOW MANY PEOPLE LISTENING TO THE AUCTIONS CAN REALISTICALLY BID ON THEM THEY MAKE ME DEPRESSED AS I WILL NEVER EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO CHUCK IT AWAY ON AN EVENT IN THE GUISE OF CHARITY I LIKE AND SUPPORT AIN BUT THESE JUST SEEM SO DECADENT AND RUBBING THEIR MONEY IN THE FACE OF THE POOR LISTENERS
IT IS NOT LIKE YOU PAID FOR A TICKET THAT PROVIDES AN INCOME TO HIS FIRM SO HE CAN BE EMPLOYED OR ANYTHING
THE CHEEKY FUCKER HE WAS DOING HIS JOB YOU DON'T OWE HIM ANYTHING
FLASHING TRAVEL PASSES AND OBSCURING THE EXPIRATION DATE FLASHING DAY TICKET PASSING ONE VALID DAY TICKET BACKWARDS THROUGH A CROWD OF YOUR MATES CROWDING ON FOUR OR FIVE AT A TIME AND HOPING THE DRIVER DOESN'T CLOCK THE ONE OR TWO WHO DON'T PAY PAYING WITH A BUNCH OF SMALL CHANGE THAT DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO THE TICKET PRICE

I TRAVEL A LOT AT SCHOOL KICKING OUT TIME THE SHIT I'VE SEEN KIDS GET AWAY WITH
WE GET THESE A LOT AND I HAVE NEVER YET SEEN ANYONE NOT HAVE THE CORRECT TICKET
THE SMIRK YOU GET WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE GETTING BUSTED BY THE TRAIN PERSON THOUGH AND ALL THE SHIT EXCUSES ABOUT HOW THEY LOST IT DOWN THE BOG
WHY IS HE SO UNPOPULAR IN REDDIN AND WHY IS IT A PROBLEM TO ENJOY A COMEDIAN WHO IS UNPOPULAR IN REDDIN
SCREAMS REALLY LOUDLY

DOES A FUNNY WALK

SHAKES HIS HAIR ABOUT

SOLD OUT STADIUM BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER
HIS SKITS AROUND THE TRIALS OF BEING A PARENT ARE HILARIOUS
NOW HOW ARE WE EXPECTED TO JUDGE THE PROPER LEVEL OF OPPROBRIUM TO HEAP UPON YOU WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE JOKE WAS
BUT STILL NOWHERE AS IRRITATING AS RUSSELL HOWARD
OH NO I LAUGHED AT A BRITISH COMEDIANS JOKE IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD
THE ONLY OPTION IS SUICIDE
WAS IT THE ONE ABOUT HANKY PANKY
MICHAEL MCINTYRE FINALLY SAYING SOMETHING FUNNY R BRITISHSUCCESS EVEN OUR TERRIBLE COMEDIANS CAN BE FUNNY ONCE
HIS NO JUICE SKIT NEVER FAILS TO MAKE ME LAUGH
AMI BRO
PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE PETTY AND NITPICKING WHEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT A PERSON BUT THEY FAIL TO REALIZE THAT INDIVIDUALLY SOME TRAITS AREN'T TOO BAD OR AT LEAST BEARABLE BUT COMBINE THEM ALL TOGETHER MAKES YOU WANT TO TEAR YOUR BOLLOCK HAIRS OUT I'VE KNOWN A FEW PEOPLE LIKE THAT SO I CAN SYMPATHISE WITH YOU OP YOU ARE NOT ALONE
I THINK YOU SHOULD TEAM UP WITH JOHNNY MARR SEE IF HE CAN'T ADD SOME GUITAR TO THAT
I FEEL YOUR PAIN BROTHER I HAVE OF THESE PEOPLE TO LIVE WITH LUCKILY THE OTHER 2 ARE GREAT TO SAVE MY SANITY AHHHH THE JOYS OF LIVING IN LONDON
I GOT STUCK FOR TWO YEARS WITH SOMEONE LIKE THAT INITIALLY IT WAS FINE BUT GRADUALLY HE WORE ME DOWN WITH HIS VAST ARRAY OF ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING HABITS

THE HOUSE CONTRACT WAS FOR ONE YEAR BUT I CAME INTO SOME UNEXPECTED BILLS AND COULDN'T AFFORD TO MOVE OUT INTO A NEW PLACE SO I ENDED UP BEING STUCK WITH HIM FOR A SECOND YEAR I ENDED UP UTTERLY FUCKING DESPISING THE GUY TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD SPEND MOST OF MY LIFE HIDING FROM HIM AND WEARING HEADPHONES TO BLANK OUT HIS EXISTENCE IT HONESTLY FELT LIKE I WAS A PRISONER IN MY OWN HOME YEAH YOU CAN TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT THEIR ANNOYING HABITS BUT WHEN IT'S AT THE POINT THAT THE PERSON'S MERE EXISTENCE ANNOYS YOU WELL THAT CONVERSATION IS LONG GONE
YOU OKAY MAN I THINK THIS TOPIC WOULD SUIT R HOWTONOTGIVEAFUCK BETTER
I ONCE MADE AN ENTIRE BLOG OUT OF MY IRRITATION WITH MY HOUSEMATES LACK OF CLEANING RATHER THAN TELL THEM
TTCFO

LIST EVERYTHING HERE HE DOES GOOD TO VENT
KEEP REMINDING YOURSELF OF THEIR GOOD POINTS EVEN IF IT TAKES AN EFFORT TO THINK OF ANY REMINDING YOURSELF OF THEIR BAD POINTS IS NOT MAKING YOUR LIFE ANY EASIER


FAFFY
CADBURY CHOCOLATE HAS BEEN PRETTY AWFUL SINCE KRAFT BOUGHT THEM OUT SOMETHING TO DO WITH CHANGING THE SHAPE TO BE CURVED INSTEAD OF A SORT OF TRAPEZIUM SHAPE WHICH MAKES SOME OF THE INGREDIENTS SINK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BAR MESSES WITH THE EQUILIBRIUM
BRITISH CONFECTIONERY WAS AT ITS PEAK AROUND THE EARLY BACK WHEN FRUIT GUMS WERE FRUIT GUMS AND COULD REMOVE A TOOTH THEN COMPANIES STARTED GETTING AND AMERICAN AND OTHER SUCH ABERRATIONS RUINED THE TASTES OF DIFFERENT THINGS
BELGIAN MILK CHOCOLATE IS GOING TO BANKRUPT ME BUT FINNISH CHOCOLATE IS ALSO FANTASTIC AND THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE THE END OF ME
IT'S THE REASON I STARTED MAKING MY OWN SINCE THE CADBURY TAKEOVER QUALITY HAS REALLY GONE DOWNHILL CHECK OUT CHURCH ROAD CONFECTIONERY FOR PROPER WELSH CHOCOLATE BARS AND OTHER STUFF
I VERY OFTEN FIND THAT THE BARS DIFFER IN TASTE DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE BAR BREAKING OFF A PIECE FROM A BAR AND A PIECE FROM A BAR THEY TASTE DIFFERENT
I COMPLAINED DIRECT TO CADBURY ABOUT THIS IN THE SAME CALL
I COMPLAINED ABOUT MURRAY MINTS TASTING HITE NOW TOO THEY SENT ME A GIFT VOUCHER ADD THOUGH THIS CAN MAKE UP FOR RUNNING A SPECIAL PIECE OF MY CHILDHOOD MAKES ME SO FUCKING ANGRY I FEEL LIKE STARTING MY OWN CHOCOLATE FIRM TOP TIP GET YOUR CADBURYS FROM IRELAND IT'S STILL THE GOD STUFF THERE
ALDI OWN BRAND CHOCOLATE TASTES PRETTY CLOSE TO OLD CADBURYS IT'S GOT PURPLE PACKAGING AND I THINK IT'S CALLED DAIRYFINE
SAINTSBURY DO A DARK CHOCOLATE FRUIT AND NUT WHICH IS GREAT
TESCO FRUIT AND NUT TASTES PRETTY MUCH HOW I REMEMBER F N FROM WHEN I WAS A KID AND I ATE ENOUGH TO REMEMBER GIVE IT A GO BIG BAR FOR THE PRICE IT'S IN A KINDA DARK PINK PACKET

I WISH PEOPLE IN THIS SUB REALISED THEIR WAS ALREADY A BIG GAP BETWEEN GOOD CHOCOLATE AND CADBURYS BEFORE THEY CHANGED THE RECIPE
AT LEAST YOU CAN GET HIM ONE FOR CHRISTMAS I'M TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW TO GET ONE FOR MY GOLDFISH
I ALWAYS THOUGHT TRAMPOLINES LOOK RATHER TRASHY I KNOW THEY ARENT CHEAP BUT NOTHING SAYS ESSEX NOUVEAU RICHE MORE THAN A TRAMPOLINE IN THE GARDEN

THE BED WILL HAVE TO DO
UNCLE BROUGHT HIS KIDS A TRAMPOLINE YEARS AGO HIS BLACK LAB JUMPED ON IT SLIPPED BROKE ITS LEGEND DON'T FEEL BAD DOGS LIKE HUMANS DO NOT ALL LIKE THE SAME THINGS ALSO LIKE HUMANS THEY CAN INJURE THEMSELVES ON THEM

UNLIKE HUMANS WE CANT EASILY EXPLAIN TO THE DOG THE DANGERS OF A STRETCHY SURFACE

I WAS WRAPPING PRESENTS THE OTHER DAY SO HAD YOUTUBE ON SO I COULD HAVE MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE I TOILED AWAY GOOD UNTIL IT DECIDED THAT I REALLY WANTED TO WATCH A MINUTE ADVERT HAWKING ARTIFICIAL FLOOR SURFACING FOR EQUESTRIAN FACILITIES WHICH BASICALLY CONSISTED OF SOME GUY BUMMING AND ERRRRING HIS WAY THROUGH A STILTED TESTIMONIAL

I HAVE NO HORSES NO INTEREST IN HORSES AND EVEN IF I HAD PLENTY OF LAND IN THE COUNTRYSIDE THE LAST THING I'D DO IS BUILD SOMEPLACE WHERE I COULD PRACTICE MY FUCKING DRESSAGE

TO MAKE IT WORSE I WAS USING THE YOUTUBE APP ON THE TELLY SO I COULDN'T SKIP IT DESPITE REPEATED ATTEMPTS
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE DAY MY YEAR OLD GRANDAD NOW DECEASED UPON RECEIVING A CUP OF TEA I HAD MADE HIM SAID WHAT'S THAT TO WHICH I REPLIED IT'S YOUR CUP OF TEA GRANDAD

HIS STINGING RESPONSE COULD HAVE FOOLED ME

THE SHAME WILL LIVE WITH ME FOREVER
HANG YOUR HEAD AND SELF EXILE TO THE COLONIES IT'S YOUR ONLY HOPE OF A NORMAL LIFE NOW
CONSIDER THIS A DECLARATION OF YOU BEING DISOWNED
TELL HER TO MAKE HER OWN NEXT TIME
WHEN MY NORTHERN GRAN TOLD ME I MADE A LOVELY CUP OF TEA IT WAS LIKE I HAD BEEN PERSONALLY BLESSED THAT'S THE KIND OF COMPLIMENT YOU WANT FROM YOUR FUTURE IN LAWS


TO ADD HAS ANYBODY ACTUALLY TAUGHT YOU TO MAKE A GOOD CUP OF TEA I'M NOT JOKING BECAUSE I USED TO MAKE A RUBBISH CUP UNTIL I LEARNED THE PROPER TECHNIQUE
TOUGH LOVE SHE IS SAVING YOU FROM FUTURE PUBLIC HUMILIATION
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND TASKED WITH MAKING MY PARENTS CUPS OF TEA I CAME UP WITH THE BRIGHT IDEA OF MAKING A SHIT ONE TO PUT THEM OFF ASKING ME AGAIN
DIDN'T WORK MIND SO NOW TO THIS DAY WHENEVER I'M ASKED TO MAKE ONE IT'S ALWAYS AND MAKE SURE IT'S NOT GNAT PISS THIS TIME
IT TOOK MY YEARS WITH MY PARTNER TILL SHE TOLD ME A MADE AN ACCEPTABLE CUP OF TEA

SHE'S JUST A FUSSY DRINKER THAT BREWS WITH A METHOD CLOSE TO MAKING CRYSTAL METHOD
I GET YOUR PAIN I REALLY DO

I LOST IT AT AMAZON THE OTHER DAY WELL I DIDN'T THINK I DID BUT THE GROVELLING APOLOGY SUGGESTS THE COMPLAINT WAS TAKEN SERIOUSLY I ONLY EXPRESSED MY UTTER ANNOYANCE AT THE INEVITABILITY THAT YET AGAIN SENDING A PACKAGE BY YODEL HAD RESULTED IN IT BEING OUT FOR DELIVERY DAYS STRAIGHT AT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE END OF THE COUNTRY FROM WHERE I LIVE WITH NO ONE APPARENTLY NOTICING THIS I THEN ASKED IF THE ITEM IS SMALL ENOUGH CAN THEY ENSURE TO USE ROYAL MAIL IN FUTURE AS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE ARRIVES WHEN AND WHERE IT IS SUPPOSED TO WHEREAS YODEL AND HERMES HAVE ABOUT A SUCCESS RATE THEY APPARENTLY RELAYED MY COMPLAINT TO AMAZON MANAGEMENT AND YODEL MANAGEMENT

IT WAS A 2 NAIL VARNISH I DIDN'T EVEN WANT BUT HAD PURCHASED TO GET ADD ON ITEMS DELIVERED I WAS SO EMBARRASSED BY MY COMPLAINT OVER SUCH A SMALL ITEM BUT THE UTTER INCOMPETENCE YET AGAIN JUST PISSED ME OFFICIAL NOT TO MENTION THE STUPIDITY THAT ADDING A 2 ITEM WHICH WAS DISPATCHED BY A DIFFERENT CARRIER AND TOOK A SIGHTSEEING TRIP ROUND THE UK APPARENTLY MADE MY ORDER ECONOMICALLY VIABLE FOR THEM

ANYWAY TL R YOU MUST LIVE IN SOME KIND OF ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE YODEL IS AS HITE AS NORMAL
I MEAN OP ORDERED BUT THEY'RE WORKING ON IT
I BET THEY GOT IT THE WRONG WAY ROUND PARCEL DELIVERED TODAY BEEN DELIVERED YESTERDAY AND THE PARCEL DELIVERED YESTERDAY BEEN DELIVERED TODAY

YOU CAN NORMALLY GET YORKSHIRE TEA DIRT CHEAP AT B M BARGAINS THERE'S NO EXCUSE
PHILISTINES ONLY TWINING IS ACCEPTABLE OR THOSE CLIPPER FOLK

MIND YOU HALF THE TEA IN THAT AISLE ALL COMES IN THOSE DONCY BLOODY BAGS NOWADAYS AT FOR BAGS
I HAVE SWITCHED OVER TO USING LOOSE TEA LEAVES CHEAPER BY WEIGHT

JUST MAKE SURE IF YOU DO SWITCH YOUR EITHER USED TO DRINKING TEA WITH LOOSE LEAVES LEAVE MORE THE END OR YOU EACH HAVE A STRAINER APART FROM AFOREMENTIONED PERSON TAKING OVER TEA COFFEE

IF THEY DRINK COFFEE THEY SHOULD HAVE A SHORT DROP FOLLOWED BY A SHARP STOP FOR USING OWN BRAND
YORKSHIRE TEA GOLD OR NOTHING
MY COMPANY PUT OWN BRAND IN A YORKSHIRE TEA TIN DICKS
JUDGING BY THE NUMBER OF COMMENTS ZERO SINCE THIS WAS POSTED HOURS AGO NO ONE HAS EXPERIENCED PUBLIC TRANSPORT ARRIVING EARLY WHICH IS ABOUT RIGHT
IT'S A TUBE THEY RUN EVERY TWO MINUTES THERE'S NO EARLY OR LATE WITH THE TUBE
GOT TO TRAIN STATION IN WALES CHECKED ON PHONE MINS TO GO
I THEN CHECK THE BOARD AT THE STATION
TRAIN MINUTES EARLY
LITERALLY STATED TRAIN MINUTES EARLY
WHERE IT SCROLLS THE STOPS

HAD TO WAIT MINUTES FOR NEXT TRAIN
I USE SOUTHERN SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT FEELS LIKE I'M JUST SURPRISED THERE IS A TRAIN AT ALL
I JUST MISSED A DIAMOND BUS THAT WAS MINS EARLY AND WAITED FOR THE NEXT ONE WHICH WAS MINS LATE
MY BOYFRIEND THINKS I'M SILLY FOR TURNING UP AT THE BUS STOP MINUTES EARLY BUT THE AMOUNT OF TIMES HE'S MOANED ABOUT MISSING THE BUS BECAUSE HE ONLY ALLOWS HIMSELF A MINUTE BEFORE IT SHOWS UP MAKES ME FEEL SO VINDICATED

SOMETIMES BUSES ARE EARLY MIGHT AS WELL WAIT AN EXTRA MINUTES JUST IN CASE
I LAUGHED SO HARD AT THIS LOL
AREN'T MOST OF THE UNDERGROUND LINES SO FREQUENT THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER OR ARE YOU WAY OUT IN THE EDGE REGIONS

IT WAS SOLD TO HEINZ AND PRODUCTION MOVE ABROAD IN

SORRY

I GO IN TO POLITENESS IN THOSE SITUATIONS

AFTER YOU GOOD SIR GENERALLY WORKS
NOSTALGIA TRIGGER
MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S JUST A GREAT THEME SONG
THOSE FUCKING BLUE ONES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR BMW DRIVERS TO BURN THE RETINAS OF LESSER CAR DRIVERS TO VEER INTO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD SO THEY CAN CARRY ON CRUISING AT ON THE MOTORWAY
I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS

FIRSTLY THEY ARE FOG LIGHTS NOT RAIN LIGHTS

SECONDLY IF YOU CAN READ THE NUMBER PLATE OF THE CAR IN FRONT YOU DO NOT NEED TO MAKE YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN WITH FOG LIGHTS

THIRDLY IF WE ARE BUMPER TO BUMPER OR MOVING SLOWLY THERE IS NO DANGER OF ME MISSING YOU IN THE LIGHT MIST RAIN OR WHATEVER WEATHER WE ARE EXPERIENCING I CAN READ THE STICKER FROM THE PLACE THAT SUPPLIED YOUR CAR

WHY THE FUCK DO YOU NEED TO BURN MY RETINA WITH YOUR INTENSE REAR FOG LIGHT
WATCH V
I'D RATHER THAT THAN THE MANY IDIOTS I SEE NOT PUTTING ANY LIGHTS ON IN FOGGY CONDITIONS I LIVE IN A HILLY RURAL PART OF DORSET THAT GETS LOTS OF FOG BUT THERE ARE SO MANY DRIVERS THAT DON'T PUT ANY LIGHTS ON AT ALL
IF THE FOG HAS GONE OR YOU'RE STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF A QUEUE OF TRAFFIC TURN THEM OFF THEY ARE DAMN BRIGHT

LEAVE THEM ON IF YOU'RE AT THE BACK OF A QUEUE OF TRAFFIC WHEN A CAR OR TWO STOP S BEHIND YOU TURN THEM OFF AGAIN

PEOPLE SEEM CAPABLE OF TURNING OFF THEIR WIPERS IF IT STOPS RAINING BUT HAVE ZERO CONTROL OVER THEIR FOG LIGHTS WHAT'S ALL THAT ABOUT
THE ONES THAT DRIVE ME NUTS ARE THE DRIVERS IN SPITBOX CARS PUTTING FOG LIGHTS ON TO PRETEND THAT THEIR CAR HAS RUNNING LIGHTS

IT DOESN'T CUNTMUSCLE YOU'RE JUST A PRICK
I GOT A CONDITION CALLED ARLEN SYNDROME SO I TOTALLY ENJOY GETTING DIZZY FALLING OVER OR WALKING INTO SHIT WHEN THEY DRIVE BY REALLY I DO IT FOR FUN

OF COURSE SODS LAW WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY FOGGY THEIR LIGHTS MAGICALLY DON'T WORK
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE NISSAN JUKE QUASHQAI NOT SURE WHICH HAS FOG LIGHTS FOR ITS FOG LIGHTS
THERE'S NO FOG
A MATE OF MINE TOLD ME HE COULD RIG IT SO WHEN I TURN MY NORMAL HEADLIGHTS ON THE FOG LIGHTS COME ON BECAUSE IT LOOKS COOLER

I ASKED HOW AND HE STARTED GOING ON ABOUT RUNNING A WIRE FROM SOMETHING TO SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE HE FINISHED I TURNED ON MY FOG LIGHTS AND SAID OR THIS
MAKES IT EASIER TO AVOID THE RETARDS ON THE ROADS THOUGH
THEY WON'T MIST ANYTHING
I CAN UNDERSTAND FRONT FOGS ON THE WET MOTORWAY WITH LOTS OF SPRAY BUT NOT THE TOSSERS THAT USE REAR FOGS
RUBBISH THE REAL CRIMINALS ARE CYCLISTS DON'T BOTHER REPLYING I'LL BLOCK YOU IF I SEE A REPLY FROM YOU

THAT SHOULD BE THE TAGLINE I LIKE THE STUFF THERE'S SOMETHING REFRESHING ABOUT IT I ALWAYS EXPECT MY LITTLE DISCO TO START EXHALING LIKE A POWERLIFTER THEN THERE'S A MOMENT OF QUIET SORROW WHEN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT IT'S WONDERFUL IT FEELS LIKE MY BALLS ARE LITERALLY SPARKLING
I ONCE GOT IT IN MY EYES AND I FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO DIE

ME ROLLING AROUND ON THE SHOWER FLOOR CRYING WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A PRETTY SIGHT IF ANYONE WALKED IN
I TRIED THE ALDI EQUIVALENT THE OTHER DAY IN COMPARISON THE ORIGINAL SOURCE IS A GENTLE TICKLE EFFECTIVE WAKE UP THOUGH
JEEZ HAVEN'T USED THAT STUFF YEARS FOR THAT VERY REASON
IF YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF A BOTTLE OF BLACK MINT
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE MY ANUS IS DEALATED
I USED TO THINK THAT STUFF WAS BAD THEN I GOT OLDER AND DISCOVERED ALL OF THOSE AILMENTS THAT COME WITH GETTING OLDER ALONG WITH IT I DISCOVERED A CREAM NAMED PRESTOGEL IT SURE AS HELL WORKS WONDERS BUT JUST DON'T TRY SITTING DOWN FOR A FEW HOURS AFTER APPLYING THAT STUFF
REMINDS ME OF THE TIME I MISTOOK MENTHOL SHAMPOO FOR BODY WASH

THE REALISATION SET IN LONG BEFORE I GOT BELOW MY BELLY BUTTON SO DAMAGE WAS LIMITED BUT THERE WAS STILL SOME DISCOMFORT FOR A FEW HOURS AFTERWARDS
THE MINT SHAMPOO IS EVEN MORE POTENT YOUR SCALP DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

FISH AND CHIPS STARTED IN LONDON AND WAS BROUGHT OVER BY JEWISH SETTLERS

ALSO LINCOLNSHIRE GRIMSBY SPECIFICALLY WOULD TELL YORKSHIRE TO FUCK OFF WITH THEIR POOR QUALITY FISH AND POTATOES

YORKSHIRE PEOPLE HAVE AN ANNOYING HABIT OF CLAIMING GENERALLY NORTHERN THINGS AS EXCLUSIVELY OWN
THE WHOLE OF SCOTLAND LINCOLNSHIRE AND LONDON LOOK ON DISGUSTED AT THIS STATEMENT
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BATTER THEM TO DEATH AND SERVE THEM WITH CHIPS

THE BEST WAY TO MAKE IT AS PAINLESS AS POSSIBLE FOR BOTH OF US IS TO ANSWER WITH A QUICK FIRM NO NO THANK YOU I PROMISE THAT OF SALES ASSISTANTS WILL ASK THE QUESTIONS QUICKLY AND IF YOU ANSWER QUICKLY AND SIMPLY THEN IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG

I'M NOT SAYING THAT OP COMPLAINS FROM THE TEXT IT'S CLEAR YOU UNDERSTAND OUR POSITION BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY GENERALLY THAT CUSTOMERS WHO COMPLAIN MAKE THE PROCESS LONGER FOR THEMSELVES AS WE CAN'T ASK THE NEXT QUESTION AS QUICKLY I DON'T MAKE COMPANY POLICY AND I DIDN'T EVENT THE FIVE PENCE BAG CHARGE TELLING ME OFF ABOUT IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE

I DON'T WANT TO WHINE AND I KNOW EVERYONE HAS THERE BAD DAYS BUT SOMETIMES CUSTOMERS MANAGE TO REALLY UPSET ME FOR EXAMPLE ONE LADY ONCE ACCUSED ME OF LYING ABOUT THE FACT OUR FIVE PENCE BAG CHARGE GOES TO CHARITY WHO WOULD LIE ABOUT A THING LIKE THAT I ALSO ONCE HAD A MAN YELL AT ME FOR OFFERING TILL TELLERS I HAVE NO CHOICE IF I WANT TO KEEP MY JOB I'M A HUMAN BEING AND IT HURTS

JUST SLOW DOWN AND WATCH AS THEIR FURY BUILDS
COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK I WAS HAVING A DRIVING LESSON IN THE DARK AND SOME FUCK KNUCKLE IN A BIG THING COULDN'T TELL WHAT TYPE WAS RIGHT ON MY ARSE WITH HIS FULL BEAM HALOGEN LIGHTS ON IT WAS SO FUCKING BRIGHT I COULDN'T THINK STRAIGHT I GENUINELY COULDN'T CONCENTRATE ON MY DRIVING I HAD TO PULL OVER TO LET THE ARSEHOLE PASS SO I WOULDN'T CRASH THE FUCKING CAR
YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THIS BUT I'LL MENTION IT BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE DOES THERE'S USUALLY A TAB AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR REAR VIEW MIRROR FLIPPING THAT DIPS THE MIRROR SO THAT YOU GET A MUCH DIMMER VIEW OF WHAT IS BEHIND YOU IT'S MEANT FOR EXACTLY THIS PROBLEM
GO TO THE USA YOU AINT SEEN NOTHING STREET LAMPS ARE RARE AS FUCK OVER THERE AND EVERYONE HAS V8 TRUCKS WITH LIGHTS HIGH ENOUGH TO REALLY RUSTLE YOUR
THERE'S A CUNT OF A HUMAN BEING IN MY AREA WHO HAS NOT ONLY REPLACED THE STANDARD HEADLAMPS WITH THOSE WOEFUL LIGHTS BUT HAS ALSO INSTALLED STYLED ONES ON EVERY FREE BIT OF HIS GRILL LIKE IT'S A FUCKING CHRISTMAS DECORATION FOR A LOW BUDGET SHOPPING CENTRE GROTTO

IT'S A PORSCHE CAYENNE TOO SO THE LIGHTS ARE WINDSCREEN LEVEL FOR THE STANDARD HATCHBACK MEANING IT'S LIKE A FLASH GRENADE GOING OFF FOR ANY DRIVER ON HIS ONCOMING LANE
LIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF RANGE ROVER LAND THIS IS A CONSTANT ISSUE THAT DRIVES ME ABSOLUTELY MENTAL
THROW IN A BUMPY SURFACE AND SELF LEVELLING LIGHTS WHICH ONLY SEEM TO LEAVE THE LIGHTS POINTING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION FOR EVEN LONGER THAN WITH NORMAL LIGHTS
HAPPENED TO ME LAST WEEK ONLY KNEW THAT THE ARSE WAS BEHIND ME WHEN I SAW THE GLARE ON HIS WINDSCREEN FROM THE CAR THAT PASSED ME GOING THE OTHER WAY HE WAS SO CLOSE THAT I COULDNT SEE HIS HEADLIGHTS WAS TEMPTED TO HIT MY BREAK SO THAT HE WOULD GO INTO THE BACK OF ME AND CLAIM ON HIS INSURANCE
POINT YOUR DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR FULLY OUT AND SLIGHTLY UP THE REFLECTION OF THEIR OWN LIGHTS IN THEIR OWN FACE TENDS TO GET THE POINT ACROSS PRETTY DARNED QUICKLY
PULL OVER ALLOW THEM TO PASS SEE HOW THEY LIKE IT
GOOD THANKS YOURSELF IS THE OTHER I GUESS
OHHH THIS WHOLE FUCKING ISSUE REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

SOME PEOPLE ARE SO ANAL ABOUT BEING OFFERED AND OFFERING TEA AND COFFEE AT WORK

USUALLY AT A NEW PLACE I GO ALONG WITH IT FOR A WHILE BUT THEN I JUST UP AND GET MY OWN FOR SAKE WHY SHOULD I BE COERCED INTO HAVING TO OFFER EVERY TIME I'M QUITE HAPPY TO GET MY OWN AND WILL ALWAYS SAY NO TOO

REASONS WHY I HATE IT

FIRSTLY THERE'S ALWAYS ONE FUCKER WHO GETS AWAY WITH VIRTUALLY NEVER GETTING A ROUND OF TEAS IN

SECONDLY WE ALL DRINK AT DIFFERENT RATES SOMETIMES I MIGHT WANT A BOVRIL OR A WATER OR A SOUP WHY BE TIED TO HAVING TEA COFFEE AT A PARTICULAR TIME

THIRDLY THERE'S ENOUGH CORPORATE REGULATION AND MICROMANAGING WITHOUT ALL THIS SHIT TOO

IF I'M A MISERABLE FUCKER SO BE IT FUCK WHAT THEY THINK IS MY BELIEF

ACTUALLY THIS ISSUE SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN SUBREDDIT
GO AROUND THE OFFICE THREE TIMES A DAY ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY WOULD LIKE ORANGE LEMON OR RIBERA

THEY WILL PROBABLY GET THE IDEA
DECLARING YOUR DISLIKE FOR TEA ON THIS SUB IS BRAVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LYNCHED FOR LESS
DON'T WORRY I DON'T DRINK TEA OR COFFEE EITHER THEY STOPPED OFFERING ME DRINKS AT WORK AFTER YEARS BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH NO SHE DOESN'T DRINK TEA OR COFFEE AND A GENERAL LOOK OF SHOCK CONFUSION FROM CO WORKERS

EDIT JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT HAS NEVER BOTHERED ME WHEN PEOPLE OFFER IT JUST MAKES ME SMILE
WHY NOT JUST SAY THAT YOU DONT LIKE EITHER SAVES THEM ASKING AND YOU REPLYING
DON'T FORGET THE WHY DON'T YOU DRINK TEA COFFEE OR DO YOU DRINK TEA COFFEE AT HOME CONVERSATIONS
I DRINK TEA AND COFFEE I JUST DONT DRINK THE PISS WEAK STALE WARM ARSE JUICE THAT COMES OUT OF THE VENDING MACHINES UNDER THE LABEL COFFEE AND THE WHITE WARM WATER WITH FAKE MILK UNDER TEA

I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL I GET HOME TO HAVE A BREW BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACTUAL TEA OR COFFEE FACILITIES IT'S HONESTLY A FUCKING TRAVESTY I MIGHT START BRING A CAMP STOVE AND BREWING UP IN THE AIRPARK

IRONIC ISN'T IT BRITISH COMPANY DOESN'T MAKE TEA AVAILABLE TO STAFFORDSHIRE
SERVES YOU RIGHT FOR BEING A TRAITOR LORD PROTECTOR ARAGE WILL SORT YOU LOT OUT SOON ENOUGH
TELL THEM YOU FOLLOW JOHN WESLEY

IN JOHN WESLEY THE GREAT PREACHER AND FOUNDER OF THE METHODIST MOVEMENT WAS ARGUING FOR COMPLETE ABSTINENCE FROM TEA ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT GAVE RISE TO NUMBERLESS DISORDERS PARTICULARLY THOSE OF A NERVOUS KIND

SOURCE
I PREFER BEING TEA SELF SUFFICIENT

EVERYONE ELSES TEA IS SHIT I ONLY TRUST MY OWN
THE VACANT SEARING FOLLOWED BY THE QUESTION WHAT NOT EVEN HOT CHOCOLATE
FORCE YOURSELF TO DRINK TEA
IS IT ALWAYS FOLLOWED WITH AN OH ARE YOU SURE
I DON'T TRUST PEOPLE WHO DON'T DRINK TEA
I THINK IT'S PART OF THE SOCIAL INTERACTION IN THE ENVIRONMENT LIKE MONKEYS EATING BUGS OFF OF EACH BACKS THEY MIGHT EVEN BE THINKING I KNOW PREDARKNESS WILL SAY NO BUT I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE LEFT OUT AND ASK ANYWAY IT CAN BE AN EXCUSE FOR A BRIEF SOCIAL INTERACTION OR AN ANNOYANCE IF THE LATTER YOU COULD POLITELY SAY NO NEED TO ASK AS YOU DON'T LIKE HOT DRINKS
IN MY LAST PLACE WE HAD IT DOWN TO SENTENCES

MORNING
I'M FINE THANKS
ALREADY GOT ONE MATE
NIGHT

I WORK IN IT WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN IT
OFFICE WORKPLACES SOUND LIKE TERRIBLE PLACES FILLED WITH TERRIBLE PEOPLE

NO WONDER THE COUNTRY IS THE WAY IT IS
YOU MISUNDERSTAND THEY'RE NOT ASKING WHETHER YOU'RE FINE OR NOT
UGH I HAVE SUCH A DILEMMA IN MY OFFICE WITH TEA COFFEE SO I DON'T DRINK TEA AT WORK BECAUSE I ONLY USE ALMOND MILK AND I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO BRING IT IN FOR MYSELF SO I JUST DON'T HAVE HOT DRINKS AT WORK BUT I AM ALSO THE PERSON WHO ORDERS THE TEA AND COFFEE PEOPLE ALWAYS FORGET TO TELL ME WHEN THE SUPPLIES ARE LOW UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE AND THEN THE OFFICE FREAKS OUT AND THEN I'M FEELING LIKE THE BAD GUY FOR NOT CONSTANTLY CHECKING ON SOMETHING I DON'T EVEN CONSUME

SO THE OTHER MORNING WE RAN OUT OF TEA COFFEE SO PEOPLE STARTED PANICKING ONE GUY CAME UP TO ME TO GRILL ME ON IT AND I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD ORDERED SOME THE NIGHT BEFORE HE STARTED FREAKING OUT AND ASKING WHAT I MEANT BY ORDERED I EXPLAINED THAT I PLACED AN ORDER AND WAS WAITING FOR THE DELIVERY HE WAS HAVING NONE OF IT AND IN A HYSTERICAL STATE WALKED TO THE SHOP TO STOCK UP HE CAME IN CLUTCHING A LARGE BOX OF AND LOUDLY TELLING ME THAT HE'D SAVED THE DAY I SHRUGGED

THE ICING ON THE CAKE NOT MINUTES AFTER HE WAS BACK THE DELIVERY CAME AND THE KITCHEN WAS STOCKED UP AGAIN OH HOW I LAUGHED THEN I PRINTED A SIGN OUT AND STUCK IT IN THE KITCHEN TO TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED TO TELL ME BEFORE IT'S ON THE LAST DREGS
DO THEY ASK IF YOU WANT A TEA COFFEE OR IF YOU WANT A DRINK

THE FORMER IS ANNOYING THE LATTER IS ANNOYINGLY POLITE TAKE ADVANTAGE AND ASK THEM TO GET YOU A GLASS OF WATER BARELY DRINK IT THEN IF THEY ASK AGAIN JUST EXPLAIN YOU'VE ALREADY GOT ONE AFTER SEEING THE GLASS A FEW TEA COFFEE RUNS THEY'LL PROBABLY STOP ASKING

I'M A BUGGER FOR ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY WANT ME TO GET THEM SOMETHING WHILE I'M UP EVEN IF THEY'VE PREVIOUSLY SAID NO THANKS MY LOGIC IS YOUR INITIAL CHOICE CAN CHANGE IN AN HOUR I APOLOGISE ON BEHALF OF EVERYONE WHO'S TOO BLOODY ANNOYING POLITE FOR THEIR OWN GOOD WE EVEN ANNOY OURSELVES SOMETIMES
I SAID YES TO A CUP ONCE AND IT CAME BACK SO PISS WEAK IT WAS ALMOST WHITE NEVER AGAIN
THERE'S PEOPLE IN MY OFFICE AND WE ALL SIT TOGETHER

COALITION OF THE
THIS IS WHY I STARTED DRINKING TEA THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS
AT LEAST THEY OFFERED

I USED TO OFFER EVERYTIME I WANTED A BREW AND SEEING AS I LOVE TEA AS MUCH AS A CHIMP IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL FOR THE PEOPLE I SHARED AN OFFICE WITH

HOWEVER I NOTICED ONE OR TWO PERSISTENT SO NOW THEY HAVE TO MORE FREQUENTLY TWATS
I'M THE SAME BUT ALSO HAVE THE ADDITION OF NOT DRINKING ALCOHOL
DO YOU WORK IN CHELTENHAM FOR A DIGITAL CONSULTANCY
I'M PARANOID THE GUY WHO I USED TO SIT NEXT TO
I'M THE SAME I JUST ASK FOR A BREW OF WATER INSTEAD MAKES THEM FEEL USEFUL
EVEN WORSE I HAVE DECAF TEA AND THE COMMON REFRAIN IS WHAT'S THE POINT AS IF THE CAFFEINE IS THE THING THAT GIVES TEA A POINT
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SHIT ENVIRONMENT TO WORK IN
WORD VOCABULARY IMPRESSIVE
AND THEN YOU GET THE REPLY I DIDN'T ASK HOW YOU WERE

FUNNY
I JUST STAND UP AND SHOUT ANYONE FOR A DRINK IF YOU DON'T REPLY YOU DON'T GET A DRINK
I AM THE SAME I PREDOMINANTLY DRINK WATER DURING THE DAY BUT CONSTANTLY GET ASKED IF I WANT A TEA OR A COFFEE EVERY FUCKING DAY


WATCH YOURSELF IF YOU AREN'T CAREFUL SOMEONE IS GOING TO MAKE YOU ONE SOME DAY AND YOU'LL HAVE TO CHOKE IT DOWN OUT OF POLITENESS
I DON'T DRINK INSTANT COFFEE YEA I KNOW WHAT A SNOB ETC BUT THAT SHIT TASTES NOTHING LIKE COFFEE DOESN'T STOP MY COLEUS OFFERING IT TO ME ENDLESSLY NO MATER HOW MANY TIMES I TELL THEM
IN MY JOB I STARTED TODAY THE CUSTOM IS TO ASK PEOPLE AT EVERY SINGLE TABLE CLUSTER AND TAKE ALL THE ORDERS ON A TRAY TO ANOTHER ROOM FIFTY YARDS AND THREE DOORS AWAY AND ON TOP OF THAT IT IS EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF WITH REGARD TO SEABAGS AND COFFEE NO COMMUNAL FUNDAMENTAL SO IT IS TOTALLY FUCKED AND A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE

SO IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME TO TRY THE WATER CHALLENGE
BACK NOT TOO LONG AGO SMOKE THEM IF YOU'VE GOT THEM MEANT THAT IT WAS BREAK TIME IF AND ONLY IF YOU SMOKED

THIS IS HOW THE MILITARY GIVES YOU LUNG CANCER

THEY MIGHT GIVE YOU AN ANTISEPTIC WIPE IF YOU POINT OUT YOU WILL HAVE TO USE A PUBLIC TOILET
SQUEEZE WEE MATE
WHY NOT JUST CUT OUT THE MIDDLE MAN AND PUNCH YOURSELF IN THE FACE AND WORK FROM HOME
HOW THE GOVERNMENT ALLOW SOUTHERN TO OPERATE SUCH A SHODDY SYSTEM IS A MYSTERY TO ME THERE MUST BE PERFORMANCE STANDARD REGULATIONS THEN CAN USE TO TAKE OVER THE LINE
PROBABLY LEFT THE HANDBAG BEHIND TOO
DEPENDS ON THE TEA
I TAKE A CUP OF BED TO TEA WITH ME CAN'T SLEEP WITHOUT IT
SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOUR TEA THEN
CONSIDERING THE J ROSS SHOW WAS DAYS AGO NEITHER DO I
IM GLAD I MISSED IT
TRUE BUT IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO KEEP A BAR OPEN

MY LOCAL SAINTSBURY CHARGE FOR A BOTTLE OF PINOT THE SAME WINE I CAN BUY FOR A BOTTLE IN ALDI
TIME TO FIND ANOTHER BAR
WE ARE ALL BOURGEOIS NOW
THE CURRY HOUSE WE USED TO GO TO USED TO SEND MY FRIEND ACROSS THE ROAD FOR A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF STRONGBOX THEN SELL IT BACK TO HIM AT A PINT
MORON IN DOESN'T KNOW PUBS HAVE TO PAY FOR HEATING ELECTRICS SERVICE STAFF CLEANERS BUILDING INSURANCE UPKEEP ETC ETC ETC SHOCK
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS

DUTY ON STILL WINE AND EXCEEDING BUT NOT EXCEEDING ABV PER HECTOLITRE OF PRODUCT

THAT'S TAX FOR YOUR GLASS OF WINE TO BE SERVED IN A PUB INSTEAD OF FROM A SUPERMARKET

ON THE BOTTLE

IN CASE ANYONE TRIES TO BLAME EVERYTHING ON TAX
IT'S EXTORTIONATE
YES AND I CAN MAKE AN EPIC PASTA DISH FOR TWO QUID THAT COSTS A TENNER PLUS IN AN AVERAGE RESTAURANT

YOUR POINT BEING
IS YOUR LOCAL SAINTSBURY A PUB
NEWSFLASH RESTAURANTS AND BARS SELL FOOD AND DRINK FOR PROFIT
MY LOCAL CHARGES FOR A BOTTLE OF COCA-COLA THE SAME COCA-COLA I CAN BUY FOR FOR A L BOTTLE IN
ISN'T THAT HOW PUB'S AND BAR'S WORK
SO ASSUMING THIS WAS BOUGHT IN A STANDARD PUB I'VE CALCULATED BASED ON THE STANDARD INDUSTRY TARGET OF COST YOUR GLASS OF WINE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDING VAT
IF HOWEVER YOU BOUGHT IT IN AN UPMARKET WINE BAR OR RESTAURANT YOU'LL BE PAYING A PREMIUM ON TOP OF THAT IN A TOP HOTEL EVEN MORE
THATS HOW IT WORKS
PUBS BARS AND RESTAURANTS HAVE TO PAY THEIR CHEFS SERVERS BARTENDERS PORTERS FOOD DRINK RENT EMPLOYERS NI CONTRIBUTIONS WASTE COLLECTION CROCKERY GLASSWARE CLEANERS MUSIC LICENCE TV LICENCE AND SKY IF THEY HAVE IT POS SYSTEMS INSURANCE GAS ELECTRIC INSURANCE COOKING AND COOLING EQUIPMENT CLEANING EQUIPMENT PEST CONTROL ONLINE BOOKING SOFTWARE LAUNDRY AND THE LIST GOES ON

SO PLEASE IF YOU DON'T LIKE PAYING FOR YOUR LARGE GLASS OF WINE THEN STAY AT HOME IN THE DARK WITH THE HEATING OFF DRINKING IT FROM A DIRTY GLASS
DON'T LIKE IT DON'T BUY IT

SIMPLE
WELCOME TO CAPITALISM SUCK IT UP
SO MUCH OF THIS

ON FRIDAY EVENING I WENT TO BUY TEA BAGS AND WAS ALMOST CONVINCED MY LOCAL TESCO HAD STOPPED SELLING THEM COULDN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE EVENTUALLY FOUND THEM IN THE SORT OF EXTENSION TYPE PART OF THE SHOP WHICH USED TO HAVE BEERS WINES IN BUT THEN CHANGED TO CRISPS BISCUITS APPARENTLY THAT SECTION IS NOW TEAS AND JUICES
IT'S A TACTIC TO KEEP REGULARS IN LONGER THEY MAKE MORE SALES THIS WAY
MY LOCAL MORRIONS GOT RID OF A COUPLE OF AISLES SO NOW 2 PEOPLE CAN WALK PAST EACH OTHER DOWN THE SAME AISLE BRILLIANT ONLY TOOK YEARS FOR THEM TO FIGURE THAT OUT
GOING TO BE A LOT OF BLIND PEOPLE EATING DOG FOOD AGAIN
SO YOU SPEND LONGER IN THERE LOOKING FOR SHIT AND BUY MORE SPECIAL OFFERS THEY'RE ORGANISED I'M YELLING YA
ONLINE SHOPPING YOU ACTUALLY GO INTO STORE ARE YOU MAD
COULD BE WORSE I'VE JUST LEARNT WHERE EVERYTHING IS IN MY LOCAL CO-OP AND THEY'VE DECIDED TO RENOVATE THE WHOLE FUCKING BUILDING
I THINK THAT'S PARTIALLY TO HIDE THE RECENT SPATE OF MISSING ITEMS

IF YOU SHIFT EVERYTHING AROUND IT'S HARDER TO POINT OUT WHAT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE
SECONDED

ANY TIME LOCAL SHOP DOES THIS I GET SICK OF LOOKING FOR WHAT I WANT THAT I JUST GRAB AN ITEM OR TWO THEN OVER THE FOLLOWING WEEKS I FINALLY SPOT WHAT I NEED JUST BEFORE IT'LL MOST LIKELY ALL CHANGE AGAIN
THEY DO THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STATISTICALLY MORE LIKELY TO BUY MORE IF YOU HAVE TO SEARCH FOR WHAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT
IT'S THEIR IDEA TO HIDE THE PASSWORDS
HAVE YOU BEEN IN AN ALDI OR A IDL YES IT'S GOOD VALUE AND YES THE PRODUCE IS PRETTY GOOD QUALITY BUT CHRIST IT'S LIKE WALKING ROUND A JUMBLE SALE NOTHING IS EVER WHERE IT WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WENT IN
SOME WAG POINTED OUT THAT TESCO ET AL ARE SHOOTING THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT WITH THIS NONSENSE OF COURSE THEY DO IT TO ENSURE YOU TRAVERSE THE WHOLE SHOP IN ORDER TO GET YOUR BASICS HOWEVER IT ALSO FORCES THEIR OWN STAFF TO PERFORM THE SAME EXTENDED JOURNEY AS THEY PICK GOODS FOR ON-LINE SHOPPERS SO IT COSTS THEM MONEY TOO
TRUST ME AS MUCH AS IT PISSES YOU OFF IT DOES THE STAFF TOO I WORK IN A TESCO AND AT NIGHT WE'VE HAD FRIDGES CLEANED AND OVER THE PAST MONTH OR SO CUSTOMERS ARE ACTUALLY HAVING TO COMMUNICATE WITH US IN ORDER TO BUY THE SAME THING THEY HAVE FOR YEARS NOT ONLY DOES IT MEAN WE HAVE TO GO OUT OF OUR WAY TO GET SAID ITEM OUT OF THE CHILLER BUT AT WHO WANTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH ANYONE
YEAH AND TILL TESCO EMPLOYEES REMEMBER WHERE ALL THE STUFF WENT
SAME IF HE YAWNS YOU DONT WANT HIM TO THINK HE INSPIRED YOU
WHY


THIS HAS BEEN THE MAJORITY OF MY UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE THUS FAR
THE IRONY OF NEEDING TEA IN ORDER TO MAKE TEA
AS A TESTIMONY OF THEIR I DON'T CARE CULTURE THE FRENCH ALSO LIKE SERVING WARM WATER IN A TEA POT AND THE TEA BAG NEXT TO IT

BREWING HOW DOES IT WORK
AH TRUSTING A FRENCHMAN TO MAKE YOU A CUPPA THAT WAS YOUR FIRST MISTAKE JOHNNY FRENCHIER MAKES A TIP TOP CUP OF COFFEE AND HE WHIPS UP AN OMELETTE SOMETHING LOVELY BUT ALLOWING HIM ACCESS THO THE HOLY OF HOLIES AND BEING DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RESULT MAY AS WELL GIVE HIM A RIFLE AND ACT SURPRISED WHEN HE USES IT TO WAVE A WHITE FLAG
THANKED HIM LUKEWARMLY I ASSUME
THIS IS WHY WE HAD A HUNDRED YEAR WAR
I LOVE WHEN ALL THREE OF YOU GO AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME AND AORTA PIROUETTE ROUND THE ROUNDABOUT LIKE IT WAS CHOREOGRAPHED
SHOUT HESITAAAAANCE AND FLOOR IT
OLDEST MOST BEAT-UP CAR GOES FIRST
WAITING AT A MINI ROUNDABOUT THE LONDON WAY IS TO IGNORE IT AND CUT STRAIGHT ACROSS
A MEXICAN STANDOFF
BE THE FIRST MOVE
I'M ALWAYS THE NICE ONE I GO TO SAVE THE OTHER TWO HAVING TO MAKE A DECISION
I ALWAYS TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM AND GO FIRST
DRIVING A FORD KA IT CORNERS INCREDIBLY WELL IN THAT SITUATION I WILL TEND TO GO FIRST PURELY AS I CAN AVOID ISSUES SHOULD ANOTHER CAR DECIDE TO GO

THE ONE THAT PISSES ME OFF IS COMING TO A WAY MINI ROUNDABOUT WITH CARS AND THE CAR TO THE LEFT OF THE CLEAR ROAD STOPS TO GIVE WAY TO THE CAR WAITING 2 JUNCTIONS TO THE RIGHT
FEAR NOT THE PIGEON PERCHED PRECARIOUSLY ON TOP OF THE LAMPPOST DID SO FOR YOU
IF WE WEREN'T ALL CRAMMED IN LIKE IT WAS A MERRY DAY TRIP TO AUSCHWITZ RATHER THAN THE FROM SLOUGH MAYBE WE'D HAVE ROOM TO TAKE OFF OUR COATS TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM
LAST WEEK I HAD MY LAPTOP TO BRING IN WITH ME SO I PLACED IT ON THE FLOOR IN MY BAG NEXT TO MY FEET WHEN I ARRIVED AT MY STATION IT WAS SO HOT I WAS WORRIED IT WOULDN'T TURN ON WHEN I GOT TO THE OFFICE
THE LAST TIME I MESSAGED SOUTH WEST TRAINS ABOUT THIS THEY SAID SORRY THE TEMPERATURE IS SET IN THE DEPOT SO THESE BONGS PURCHASED STOCK THAT CANNOT BE MODIFIED DURING ITS JOURNEY HOW STUPID HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO PUT A THERMOSTAT IN THE DRIVERS CAB
SOUTH WEST BLAST BOTH THE HEATING AND THE AIR CON AT THE SAME TIME IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME
WAIT YOUR TRAIN COMPANY HAS THE HEATING ON WHEN IT'S COLD RATHER THAN ONLY IN THE SUMMER WHEN IT'S HOT WHAT MADNESS IS THIS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE SEVENTH CIRCLE OF VIOLENCE OR THE SEVENTH LAYER OF ABATOR HERE
TURNED DOWN AS IF IT ISN'T FREEZING ENOUGH IN THE SEVENTH CIRCLE OF HELL
NETWORK RAIL CHARGES ELECTRICITY ACCORDING TO MODELLING OF CONSUMPTION OF THE ROLLING STOCK AS A CLASS RATHER THAN ACTUAL USE THERE HAS BEEN A MOVE TOWARDS ON TRAIN METERING BUT IT'S A COSTLY PROCESS FOR OPERATORS TO INSTALL THOSE SYSTEMS

IT'S MOST LIKELY HEATING OR NO WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S COSTS

IN ANY CASE TICKET PRICES ARE SET BY THE DFT
THE CLASS AND UP HERE HAVE RANDOM TEMPERATURES I CAN JUST MOVE CARRIAGES IF I FANCY A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE

NOT THAT WE HAVE MORE THAN 2 OR CARRIAGES TO CHOOSE FROM
NOT JUST THAT EITHER I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF A BORED CHECKOUT OPERATOR SUBJECTING ME TO THE SPANISH INQUISITION WHEN I WANTED TO GET A FREE REPLACEMENT FOR AN OLD WORN TORN
BY FAR THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR IN THE SENSE OF PLASTIC IS THE SHOP ITSELF IF YOU'VE EVER WORKED IN THE WAREHOUSE OF A SUPERMARKET YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THERE'S MORE PLASTIC IN A SINGLE LORRYLOAD THAN AN ENTIRE WEEKLY USE OF PLASTIC BAGS
I DON'T WHAT ELSE AM I GOING TO USE TO PUT MY PLASTICS IN FOR THE RECYCLING
MY MOTHER HAS USED OLD CARRIER BAGS TO KNIT US EACH A BAG THE TYPE OF WOOLLY HAT WITH EAR FLAPS PERUVIAN TYPE THING KNITTED ON BIG NEEDLES OUT OF STRIPS OF OLD CARRIERS BLOODY BRILLIANT THEY ARE
MY GOD WHEN I HAD THIS HAPPEN I HAD A SHOP ASSISTANT GOING YOU'RE IN A CAR AS WELL SORRY MATE I DIDN'T REALISE I'VE SINGLE HANDEDLY WIPED OUT THE ARCTIC
MEANWHILE I'M COLLECTING BOTH THOSE THE ONES AT HOME
I LIVE IN A BLOCK OF FLATS AND WE HAVE AN AMERICAN STYLE RUBBISH CHUTE BAGS ARE THE BIGGEST THAT FIT DOWN THEM SO I ALWAYS END UP BUYING A HANDFUL EVERY TIME I GO SHOPPING
CLIMATE CHANGE REALLY HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH THE BAGS BAGS FOR LIFE
WHERE AS ME AND THE GUY NEXT TO ME ARE CURRENTLY COMPETING TO SEE WHO CAN TURN UP THE LATEST WITHOUT THE MANAGER MENTIONING I'M CURRENTLY LOSING TO HIS QUITE IMPRESSIVE HRS BOTH OF US LIVE WITHIN MINUTES OF WORK
THIS IS A GIVEN FOR ANYONE WHO HAS TO USE A SERVICE PROVIDED BY FIRST BUS
I LITERALLY HATE EVERYTHING THEY STAND FOR
THE FACT THEY'RE ON IN NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER

MAYBE THE LAST WEEK OF NOVEMBER THEN ALL OF CHRISTMAS THAT'D BE SOUND
THE PARODIES ARE THE WORST PART
OR YOU JUST GET UP AND WALK TO THE EDGE OF THE ROAD TO SIGNAL THIS IS WHERE THE QUEUE STARTS MOTHERFUCKERS GET BEHIND ME
SIMPLY EXPLAIN OH IT'S OK THE BUS ISN'T COMING YET SIT DOWN AGAIN I'M JUST STANDING UP BECAUSE MY PILES ARE HURTING ME
PRETEND YOU HAVE A PHONE CALL AND GOT UP FOR PRIVACY
I DON'T GET HOW THEY INSURE THEM
I STILL CHUCKLE WHENEVER I STILL SEE A PLATE
AYE I PAID FOR MY LAST CAR SOLD IT AND BOUGHT A MOTORBIKE

BUT I LIKE KNOWING I CAN GO MUCH FASTER THAN THE GUY IN A BRAND NEW ASTON MARTIN AND I ONLY PAID FOR THE PRIVILEGE
IS THE P PLATE A LEGAL REQUIREMENT NOW WHY WOULD ANYONE USE IT IF IT'S NOT
THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT THEY MISSED THE BEST ONE
MEME MAGIC
BUT IF SHE LOOKS FRIENDLY THERE'S THE RISK OF HER TALKING TO YOU ISN'T THERE
EVERY DAY
ADD BACON FOR ADD CHEESE FOR
CHIPS SERVED IN A BUCKET AND BURGER ON A ROOF TILE
WERE THEY STACKED ON SOME SLATE TO LOOK LIKE A
DOES ANYONE ELSE FIND THE WORD GASTROPUB UNAPPEALING IT'S TOO CLOSE TO WORDS LIKE GASTROENTERITIS FOR MY LIKING
COME TO THE BAR I WORK AT YOU CAN SPEND ON ONE BLOODY DRINK AND THAT'S NOT EVEN A SHARING ONE EITHER
WELL THEY WERE COOKED TIMES
AND THAT IS WITHOUT CHEESE
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO GET SO MANY CHIPS
GO TO WETHERSPOONS I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK DOWN ON THEM BUT IT'S LIKE FOR A GOURMET BURGER WITH CHIPS ONION RINGS AND A DRINK
I PAID FOR A BURGER IN HACKNEY LAST YEAR IT DIDNT COME WITH CHIPS IT WAS A NICE BURGER BUT IT WASNT A BURGER
CHIPS SERVED IN A MINI DEEP FAT FRYER BASKET
THERE WAS A PLACE I WENT TO ONCE THAT HAD A HEISENBURGER IT WAS BASICALLY A CHEESE AND BACON BURGER NOT EVEN BLUE CHEESE AND NOT A SINGLE MENTION OF CHILLI POWDER WHY EVEN BOTHER WITH THE NAME
I'M OVER IN THE US JUST NOW AND THEY'VE HUMPED MY FAVOURITE AIRPORT NEWARK I USED TO SIT AND HAVE A MCDONALDS AND THEN GET A MASSIVE CUP OF TEA FROM DUNKIN DOUGHNUTS AND SIT CONTENTLY READING WHILE I WAITED A FEW HOURS ON MY CONNECTION

ALL GONE NOW ALL THEY HAVE NOW IS IPAD AND FANCY BARS THAT ARE ALL THE SAME WITH DIFFERENT FLAIR ON THE MENUS AND CUSTOM BURGER WHICH IS LIKE MCDONALDS IF YOU WANTED TO PAY TWICE AS MUCH FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T TASTE GOOD

LT R THEY GOT RID OF ALL THE NORMAL OUTLETS IN FAVOUR OF UPMARKET HITE ONES CHARGING A FORTUNE FOR A HITE BURGER
I HATE TO JOIN IN ON THE HYPE BUT I FOUND MYSELF IN FIVE GUYS NEAR LEICESTER SQUARE THE OTHER DAY I PAID FOR A BACON CHEESEBURGER CHIPS AND A DRINK

IT WAS SO GOOD THAT I DON'T EVEN FEEL BAD
IT TOOK ATTEMPTS TO COOK CHIPS DISGRACEFUL

DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE STILL NOT READY I'VE ALREADY COOKED THEM TWICE
LOOK I DON'T MIND PAYING A TENNER FOR A BURGER AND CHIPS TELL ME FIVE GUYS ALMOST FAMOUS OR FAT HIPPO AREN'T WORTH A TENNER OR MORE AND I'LL FIGHT YOU MATE

BUT WHEN THOSE FANCY PRETENTIOUS PUBS GIVE ME A BURGER WITH SHITTY DRY MEAT SPARSE TOPPINGS AND A DISINTEGRATING BUN AND A PLATE OF CHIPS WHICH WOULDN'T SATIATE A SMALL KITTEN THEN I'M ANGRY THAT'S A BURGER AND CHIPS THAT ISN'T WORTH A TENNER
NO IDEA HOW THEY ARE IN A GASTROPUB BUT I'VE HAD TRIPLE COOKED CHIPS FROM A STALL AT A FESTIVAL ONCE AND THEY WERE FANTASTIC TO BE FAIR
AND WHEN THE BURGER IN A BRIOCHE BUN THAT'S THE LATEST TREND HATE BRIOCHE
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF CHIPS IN ANY OTHER PUB DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD NOW EH
SEE THE NUMBER OF FLYINGS MAKES CHIPS MORE EXPENSIVE HERE YOU DON'T GET CHIPS LIKE THAT TROGLODYTE TAKEAWAY HOLE DOWN THE ROAD
I WOULD NOT PAY THAT PRICE PROBLEM SOLVED
WAS IT JUST A BURGER AND LITERALLY CHIPS

I HATE DOUBLE TRIPLE FRIED CHIPS CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S POPULAR ENOUGH TO BE A SELLING POINT TSH
YOU SEEN THE UK PRICES FOR FIVE GUYS GREAT FOOD BUT TAKE OUT A CREDIT CARD FIRST FOR PEOPLE EASY
I LIVE UP NORTHERN ELI WHAT IS A GASTROPUB IS IT A PUB THAT SELLS MORE THAN PICKLED EGGS AND A PACKET OF WALKERS
GASTRO THE CROSS BETWEEN A MUSICAL FART CONDUCTOR AND A PRETEND BUT ALSO EXPENSIVE POSH BIG MAC AND FRIES
IN LONDON THIS SOUNDS SADLY REASONABLE
I ONCE BOUGHT A BURGER FOR AND IT WAS LITERALLY A BURGER DON'T EVER GO TO THE HAMPSHIRE HOG FOLKS
BUT YOU GET TO LIVE IN LONDON
THE THING THAT MAKES ME LAUGH IS THAT IF FOOLS ARE PREPARED TO BE BASICALLY DEFRAUDED AND THEN GO BACK AND REPEAT THE EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE TIMES THEN RETAILERS THINK IT'S OK TO OVERCHARGE AND THE CYCLE CONTINUES REMOVE PATRONAGE FROM OVERPRICED RESTAURANTS AND THEY CLOSE
I LIVE IN LONDON FOR A BURGER AND CHIPS SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DEAL TO ME
FOUND A PUB JUST DOWN FROM WATERLOO YESTERDAY SAUSAGE SANDWICH CHIPS AND A PINT OF KRONENBOURG FOR THOUGHT I HAD STUMBLED THROUGH A TIME PORTAL

HASN'T MADE ME ILL YET
THE PROBLEM THERE IS NOT THE PRICE IT'S THAT YOU'RE A MUG FOR PAYING IT
MY NIECE POSTED A PICTURE OF HER MEAL SHE HAD WITH HER BOYFRIEND ON FACEBOOK TODAY SAUSAGE ON THE TINIEST BIT OF MASH WTF
TIL ABOUT TRIPLE COOKED CHIPS THEY'VE GOTTA BE A PAIN IN THE ASS TO MAKE NO WONDER THEY'RE EXPENSIVE
IS THAT CONSIDERED EXPENSIVE THESE DAYS BEEN OUT OF THE UK FOR A FEW YEARS BUT CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WENT SOMEWHERE AND YOU COULD GET A MEAL FOR THE EQUIVALENT OF QUID
IS THAT SERIOUSLY SUPPOSED TO BE EXPENSIVE THAT'S VERY CHEAP
I PAID FOR EXACTLY THIS AT LUNCHTIME THE BURGER WASN'T EVEN VERY NICE
MY LOCAL HAS STARTED DOING A WAGGY BEEF BURGER IT'S AND THE PICTURE HAS THE MOST PATHETIC WEDGE OF BEEF I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE IN AN OBNOXIOUSLY LARGE BRIOCHE BUN SUCH A RIP OFFICIAL
TRY A CORNISH PASTY AND A COFFEE FOR
FOUR CHIPS PHOTO OR GTO
FOR A BURGER AND CHIPS SOUNDS LIKE AN EXCELLENT PRICE TO ME


I KNOW WANTED STEAK AND CHIPS LAST NIGHT AND MY FRIEND WANTED AN ALL DAY ENGLISH BREAKFAST NOPE ENDED UP AT MACDONALD FOR BURGER
SEEMS PRETTY AVERAGE FOR ANY PUB THAT ISN'T SPOONS OR HAS A FLAT ROOF
PEOPLE GOING TO STUPID GATROPUBS AND THEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THE INFLATED PRICES
WHAT ARE TRIPLE COOKED CHIPS I ONLY COOK THEM ONE TIME AND THEY ARE FINE
IF IT'S A DECENT ENOUGH BURGER THEN IS PRETTY REASONABLE FOR PUB FOOD AROUND HERE
COULD BE WORST A BACON CHEESE BURGER FRIES AND A DRINK AT GUYS CASTS NEAR

THE BURGER ALONE IS NEARLY A TENNER
WHAT THE FUCK
AND I ASSUME THE CHIPS WERE STILL UNDERCOOKED THAT'S WHY AND I HATE TO SAY IT I GO FOR THE FRIES TO MAKE SURE I GET COOKED FRIED POTATOES GOODNESS
I GOT CANCER THIS YEAR AND ALSO FOUND OUT I CAN'T TOLERATE GLUTEN ANYMORE FOR SOME REASON THE GLUTEN INTOLERANCE IN DEFINITELY WORSE I'D PAY ANYTHING FOR A DECENT BURGER THE GLUTEN FREE STUFF IS REVOLTING WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE TO BE ABLE TO EAT SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A CHEESE AND TOMATO SANDWICH
YOU MEAN
DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN ONE FOR LESS THAN ABOUT LATELY IT'S WHEN IT BREAKS THE I GET REALLY PISSED
DOESN'T SEEM TO BAD AS LONG AS THE FOOD IS OF QUALITY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT IS UP TO SCRATCH I'M HAPPY
MUST OF BEEN IN SURREY
FUCK ME IF YOU PAID THAT THEN YOUR A BELLED
TRIPLE FRIED ANYTHING SMELLS MILES AWAY AND IT IS DISTINCTIVE UNPLEASANT SHARPEN UP YOUR INSTINCTS
PLUS THE ADDED ISSUE OF BEING FORCED TO EAT FOOD COOKED IN BRITAIN SERIOUSLY YOUR FOOD IS JUST TERRIBLE
IT'S WORSE WHEN YOU GET ON THE BUS WHEN IT'S EMPTY AT THE BUS STATION AND HAVE TO SLOWLY WATCH IT BUILD UP AND UP SQUEEZING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ON TO THE POINT THAT IF THE DRIVER HAD TO BREAK SUDDENLY AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE WOULD DIE THEN IT'S SLOOOOOOW AS HELL TO GET TO YOUR DESTINATION BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO STOP AT EVERY SINGLE STOP BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO GET OFF AT EACH AND YET THERE ALWAYS MANAGES TO BE A SHIPLOAD MORE PEOPLE GETTING ON AT THE STOPS THAN THOSE WHO GET OFFICIAL
THOSE INCONSIDERATE ARSEHOLE
THIS MORNING I WAS WAITING PATIENTLY FOR THE BUS WHEN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BUS TURNED UP AND WE WERE TOLD THE ORIGINAL HAD BROKEN DOWN SO WE HAD TO GET THIS ONE WHICH WAS COMPLETELY FULL AND TOOK MINUTES FOR WHAT WAS A MINUTES JOURNEY BECAUSE IT WENT THROUGH ABOUT VILLAGES FIRST I WAS VERY LATE FOR WORK

I HATE PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN THIS COUNTRY
GET ON THE ONE THAT'S USUALLY DIRECTLY BEHIND IT
THE AD IS EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS THEY SAY THE BEST THING THIS CHRISTMAS IS YOURSELF BEING WITH FAMILY AS OPPOSED TO LOTS OF EXPENSIVE THINGS FROM THIS CHRISTMAS KIND OF DEFEATS THE POINT
WAY TOO MANY LONG FEEL GOOD CHRISTMAS ADS THIS YEAR COLLECTIVELY THEY'VE KILLED THE GOOSE BY OVERDOING IT
IT'S GOT A MINCE PIE IN IT I BELIEVE THEY PROBABLY SELL MINCE PIES

I ACTUALLY ENJOY THE ONES THAT AREN'T STRAIGHT ADVERTS ESPECIALLY IF THEY'VE GOT ROBINS IN THEM
HOPE THE INTERVIEW WENT WELL REGARDLESS

WAS IT A COMPANY THAT IS LIKELY TO HAVE RELATIONS TO FRANCE SOMEHOW POSSIBLY SOMEONE FROM THE COMPANY HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY IT OR SOMETHING
FOR FRANCE WHATS WRONG WITH FRANCE
GAP INSURANCE IS A LIFE SAVER
HOW MUCH DAMAGE DID YOU DO HOW MUCH IS THE CAR WORTH
BUMMER SO NEAR TO CHRISTMAS TOO

AND YOU FEEL THE NEED TO ADVERTISE THE RADIO ADVERTISEMENT ABOUT THE TV ADVERT
THE FUCKING SUN IS A RARE ASTRONOMICAL EVENT
HERE'S A TIP YOU SHOULDN'T BELIEVE IN ANY ASTROLOGICAL EVENT
CHECK TOMORROW THE MAIN POINT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT MASCULINE

BUT IT'S ONLY LARGER THAN USUAL SO IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE
ASTRONOMICAL NOT ASTROLOGICAL
I SAW THE MOON ABOUT MONTHS AGO AND IT LOOKED MASSIVE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT TOTAL ECLIPSES OF THE SUN WE GET ONE IN BRITAIN MOST DAYS
IF YOU MEAN THE SUPERMOON IT HAPPENS YEARLY IT CAN BE A LITTLE MORE SUPER THAN OTHERS BUT IT'S NOT LIKE SUPERMOON LUNAR ECLIPSE RARE WHICH HAPPENED LAST YEAR
UP IN THE HIGHLANDS THE OTHER DAY GOT TOLD NOT A LOT IF LIGHT POLLUTION SO WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE LOADS OF STARS CLOUDY ALL WEEK
YOU'VE DENTED IT IN THE MIDDLE SO NOW IT WON'T ROLL ABOUT PROPERLY

AMATEUR
IS THIS A LEGITIMATE POST MATCHING THE THEME OF THE BOARD OR ARE WE GOING TO START THE BULLSHIT WAR ON CHRISTMAS NONSENSE ARE YOU GOING TO JUST ACCEPT THAT SHIPLOADS OF RELIGIONS HAVE EVENTS AROUND THE SAME TIME AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS AND HOLIDAY SEASON CAN BE USED
FOR SOME REASON THIS REMINDS ME OF MY MUM SHE WON'T WATCH NATURE DOCUMENTARIES BECAUSE THEY'RE HORRIBLE BUT WILL WATCH PROGRAMS FEATURING GRAPHIC DEPICTIONS OF SURGERY CHILDBIRTH OR WATCH THOSE TRUE LIFE MOVIES THAT MAY FEATURE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING KIDNAPPED CHILDREN SICK CHILDREN OR CHILD ABUSE
NEWSFLASH NATURE IS BRUTAL AND HEARTBREAKING BUT ALSO STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL I SUGGEST THE AUTHOR OF THAT ARTICLE STICK TO SOMETHING A BIT MORE LIGHT HEARTED IF THEY CAN'T FACE THE REALITY OF NATURE

ALTHOUGH I COULDN'T HELP BUT FEEL THE SNOW LEOPARDS WEREN'T EXACTLY HELPING THEIR OWN EXISTENCE IF EVERY ENCOUNTER ENDS UP IN A NEAR FATAL SCRAP
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE LEFTIES WHO WERE MEANT TO BE THE SPINELESS CRYBABIES IT'S NATURE SUCK IT UP DAILY FAIL
WELL WE COULD JUST SHOOT THEM
JESUS FUCK WHAT AN ARTICLE
I WAS UNAWARE OF IT BUT READ IT JUST NOW

WHAT WAS IT ABOUT WHAT IS THEIR AIM FOR THIS IF IT'S CLICKBAIT WELL I SUPPOSE IT WORKED BUT I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH UNDERSTANDING THE THOUGHT PROCESS ARE THEY JUST WANTING WEBSITE VIEWS OR WANTING TO TURN PEOPLE AGAINST ATTENBOROUGH IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S BEEN PUTTING ANIMALS TOGETHER LIKE SOME KIND OF COCKFIGHTING RING


UGH

LOOKS LIKE THE MAIL HAS GOT ME THIS TIME CONSIDER ME MIFFED

I'M ALSO ANNOYED NOW THAT MY PHONE CONSIDERS THE MAIL TO BE A VALID SOURCE OF NEWS AND I'VE TRIED MY BEST TO PURGE IT BUT NOW I ACCIDENTALLY FORGOT TO USE INCOGNITO MODE AND I KNOW I WILL GET ENDLESS ARTICLES FROM THE DAILY MAIL SITE ON MY FEED
THAT'S TREASON
JUST READ IT TOO WELL THAT WAS A ROLLERCOASTER HOPEFULLY SOMEONE'S TAKEN PITY ON THE POOR SENSITIVE SOUL TUNED HIS TELLY TO CBEEBIES AND HIDDEN THE REMOTE
DAILY FUCKING MAIL I WONDER IF HOPKINS WILL MAKE GOOD ON HER THREAT TO MOVE TO TRUMPS NEW KINGDOM
CAN'T IMAGINE IT WOULD COST THE PRODUCERS TOO MUCH
AND DON'T FORGET THEY WILL HAVE A GOGGLEBOX EPISODE OF HER FAMILY WATCHING HERALDRY
SHE'S ALSO A RADIO PRESENTER ON CAPITAL NORTH EAST BUT SHE GOT THAT FOR BEING ON GOGGLEBOX SO YEAH SHE'S NO CELEB
I DIDN'T WATCH IT LAST NIGHT BUT DID LOOK UP WHO THE CELEBS ARE I'VE ONLY HEARD OF THREE OF THEM SCRAPING THE BARREL THESE DAYS
FUN FACT MY COUSIN'S SHAGGED HER AND I LIVE WALKING DISTANCE FROM HER HOUSE

FUN FACT EXTRA I FOUND OUT ABOUT HER FROM HEARING THAT NEWS RATHER THAN GOGGLEBOX
CELEB IF ACTING LIKE AN IDIOT TO GET YOU ON TV IS BEING A CELEB THEN WHATEVER BUT IT JUST MAKES TEENAGE GIRLS COPY THE BEHAVIOUR IT'S ANNOYING AS FUCK
IF I'M HONEST SHE'S THE ONLY ONE IN THE LINEUP I RECOGNISE
SHE WAS FUNNY SO I'M NOT REALLY ARCED
HOW IS GOGGLEBOX EVEN A THING WHO WATCHES OTHER PEOPLE WATCH TV
AYE SHE IS A FUCKING LEDGE THOUGH ONE OF MY FAVORITES ON GOGGLEBOX ESPECIALLY NOW THE POSH COUPLE IS NO LONGER IN IT

FUCK KNOWS WHAT THE FAT JEWISH FAMILY US DOING ON THERE STILL ANNOYING DOESN'T CUT IT
THE ONLY NEWS I PAY ANY ATTENTION TO IS WHAT'S POSTED HERE AND IN R UK WITH A BIT OF COMMON SENSE THE BULLSHIT QUOTIENT CAN BE SATISFYINGLY LOW
HAS THEIR CAMPAIGN OF HATE GOT WORSE IN RECENT YEARS OR ARE THEY JUST GETTING MORE ATTENTION SERIOUS QUESTION
ED BEARS

YEAH YOU TRY AND MAKE A BEAR PUN ON HIS NAME IT'S NOT EASY
IT TURNS OUT JUNGLE BOOK WAS A DOCUMENTARY
I HONESTLY THINK I'D ENJOY IT MORE IF THEY JUST HAD MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC RATHER THAN CELEBRITIES
I ONLY KNOW LARRY LAMB EASTENDERS GAVIN AND STACEY CAROL BONDERMAN OLA OFF STRICTLY AND THE ACTOR OFF SUMMERDALE WHO'S BROTHER IS RYAN GRIMSHAW OFF CORRIE BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT I ALWAYS THOUGHT I'M A CELEB WAS INCAPABLE OF SCRAPING THE BARREL BUT THIS YEAR THEY'VE PROVED ME WRONG THEY'RE GOING LIKE CELEB BIG BROTHER
I AM A HUMAN BEING IN THE JUNGLE GET ME OUT OF HERE
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THERE WAS A CELEBRITY VERSION OF I'M A CELEBRITY GET ME OUT OF HERE JOKE STOLEN BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER FROM WHOM
AND WHO ARE THOSE TWO FUCKING MUGS PRESENTING IT
OH GOD I'VE GOT ONE OF THEM TOO AND I HATE THAT EVERY TIME I SIT DOWN TO READ THE PAPER OR BROWSE REDDIN I HAVE TO SHOO MY NOSY HEATER AWAY FROM STARTING OVER MY SHOULDER AND THE TIMES I'VE CAUGHT IT TWITCHING THE CURTAINS SPYING ON THE NEIGHBOURS


TAKE IT TO A DIFFERENT ARGOS AND TRY AGAIN

NEXT TIME DO CLICK AND COLLECT AND YOU'LL BE COVERED BY THE DISTANCE SELLING REGS FAR EASIER TO RETURN
UNLESS THE ITEM WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE DAY RETURNS POLICY THEY'RE LEGALLY OBLIGED TO HONOUR IT SINCE THE POLICY FORMS PART OF THE CONTRACT OF SALE TRY AGAIN WITH A DIFFERENT EMPLOYEE AND IF THEY REFUSE ASK FOR THEIR SPECIFIC REASONS AND THEIR NAME SO YOU CAN TAKE THE MATTER UP WITH TRADING STANDARDS AND THEIR HEAD OFFICE BE POLITE BUT FIRM WATCH THEM EITHER SHIT A BRICK AND CONCEDE TO GIVE YOU A REFUND OR LET HEAD OFFICE SORT IT OUT FOR YOU POSSIBLY WITH SOME VOUCHERS THROWN IN TO APPEASE YOU
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE TONIGHT
THERE ARE AN AVERAGE OF SUPERMOONS A YEAR THIS IS NOT THE FIRST ONE SINCE
DELETED
I HAD THAT BUT ONLY CERTAIN SHOPS

RIPPED THE TAG OUT AND STUCK IT IN THE WIFE'S JACKET ONCE
ONCE AS A YOUNG RASCAL I FOUND A STACK OF SECURITY TAGS IT WAS GREAT FUN SURREPTITIOUSLY DROPPING THEM INTO BAGS AND TROLLEYS WHILE THEY WEREN'T LOOKING AND SITTING OUTSIDE TO WAIT FOR THE SHOW

ALSO I HAD A SET OF HEADPHONES THAT SET ALARMS OFFICIAL NEVER WORKED THAT ONE OUT
THERE'S PROBABLY A SECURITY TAG LEFT IN IT
YOU SHOP AS NORMAL AND IGNORE THE ALARMS
DELETED
BOUGHT AN EX LIBRARY BOOK ON AMAZON STILL HAD THE TAG IN SET OFF THE ALARM AT TESCO EVERY DAY FOR MONTHS CARRYING IT
EXCELLENT WAY TO SHOPLIFT AT CHRISTMAS IT'S VERY BUSY AND YOU'LL GET WAVED OUT BECAUSE YOU WENT OFF ON THE WAY IN
LADIES ON TILLS IN TESCO FOUNT OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE

CHECK TO SEE IF SOME SCAMP HAS PLACED A SECURITY TAG UPON YOUR PERSON UNDER YOUR SHOE INSOLE IS A GOOD PLACE
MY FIRST IPHONE SET SHOP ALARMS OFF IF IT HAD UNREAD TEXTS
NETWORK RAILCAR I PRESUME MINIMUM FARE OF AFTER NOT VALID BEFORE
THE POINT OF THE CARD IS TO ENCOURAGE LEISURE TRAVEL IT'S NOT FOR COMMUTING TO WORK COLLEGE THAT'S WHY SEASON TICKETS EXIST

THAT'S WHY THERE'S A MINIMUM FARE BEFORE AM EXCEPT DURING SUMMER HOLIDAYS YOU'LL STILL GET A PARTIAL BENEFIT IF YOUR FARE IS MORE THAN
AND ON A SCHOOL NIGHT WHAT HAS THE WORLD COME TO
THE SCHOOL LAUNCHES FIREWORKS

ON OUR OPEN EVENING WE MADE DO WITH AN ASSORTMENT OF POWDERED METALS THAT SMALL CHILDREN HELD OVER BUNSEN BURNERS WHILST WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS IS HOW FIREWORKS WORK CHILDREN NOW MAKE SURE YOU BRING YOUR CHILD TO THIS SCHOOL PARENTS


I MISS THE CHOCOLATE SPONGE THAT CAME WITH PINK CUSTARD
ARE YOU BAKING IT IN A TRAY THAT SERVES AT A TIME
THERE'S A RECIPE FOR JAM COLY POLY AND PINK CUSTARD ON THE BRAUN WEBSITE CHOCOLATE SPONGE AND GREEN MINT CUSTARD IS ANOTHER ONE TO LOOK OUT FOR
WHEN YOU'VE NEVER TRIED CUSTARD BEFORE AND NOW REGRET THE MANY CHANCES I HAD IN PRIMARY SCHOOL TO TASTE IT
MY PRIMARY SCHOOL TOMATO KETCHUP WAS AMAZING I'VE NEVER TASTED ANYTHING AS GOOD SINCE NOT EVEN HEINZ
TINNED SPONGE AND CUSTARD MATE

OR YOU CAN DO STEAMED SPONGE AND CHEAP POWDERED CUSTARD
YOU COULD TRY SENDING A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST
THAT SHIT ALL USED TO COME FROM CENTRALISED GOVT SUPPLIERS SAME AS HOSPITALS HIT UP A CASH N CARRY BOOKERS OR MAKKRO IF YOU HAVE ONE NEAR FIND THE CHEAPEST BULK CATERING SPONGE MIX THEY HAVE DITTO CUSTARD POWDER I RECKON YOU'LL GET PRETTY CLOSE
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SUPPOSED SNOW TOO BUT I KNOW I'LL HATE THE ICE THAT FOLLOWS
SNOW IS GREAT FOR DISRUPTING YOUR WAY TO WORK FOR THAT ONE DAY WHEN YOU WANT TO STAY INSIDE AND WORK FROM HOME BUT BLACK ICE IS GREAT FOR BREAKING LEGS
I CYCLE TO WORK AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE NO SNOW I MAY ACTUALLY DIE
I'M FLUENT IN SARCASM

I LOVE TO TRAVEL

CONGRATS BITCH YOU'RE UNIQUE AS FUCK HAVE A COOKIE
PACK YOUR BAGS
THE LIME DORITOS WERE PROBABLY REALLY REALLY CHEAP NOBODY WILLINGLY STOCKS THEM
SOME LUNATIC DECIDED IT WAS FINE TO VAPE ON THE BUS I WAS ON THE OTHER DAY
I'VE NOTED AN INCREASE IN PEOPLE APING IN PLACES WHERE THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO JUST YESTERDAY I SAW SOMEONE WALK INTO A SHOPPING CENTRE AND MAKE A BIG FUSS OVER PULLING ONE OF THEM DEVICES OUT AND DOING WHATEVER IT IS THEY DO WITH THEM I PRESUMED THEY WERE JUST ANGLING FOR SOMEONE TO COMMENT AND A SUBSEQUENT FIGHT ABOUT RIGHTS ENTITLEMENT ETC

AS A CONSIDERATE APER THESE KINDS OF APERS ANNOY ME
SAW A DUDE BLOWING IMMENSE VAPE CLOUDS AT RAYNHAM ESSEX TESCO THE OTHER NIGHT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO DISAPPEAR
WOULDN'T BOTHER ME IF IT WAS OUTSIDE
ITS ILLEGAL TO SMOKE ON THE TRAIN AT THE STATION ITS AGAINST COMPANY POLICY TO VAPE
I ACTUALLY LOVE THE SMELL OF SECOND HAND VAPE EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO DO IT WHERE YOU SHOULDN'T I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S WRONG JUST WATER VAPOUR RIGHT

NOT A APER SMOKER BTW
SORRY
THERE SHOULD BE AN ITEM LIMIT ON THOSE THINGS
ALTERNATELY PEOPLE WITH BASKETS WHO SEEM TO HARBOUR SOME FORM OF PERPETUAL TERROR TRIGGERED MERELY BY THE THOUGHT OF USING A MACHINE

THIS BEGINS A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY WHEREUPON THE TERRIFIED PERSON IN QUESTION FORMS THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE COMPLETELY UNABLE TO OPERATE THE

WHEN THEY ARE PRESENTED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE ONE THEY IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN AND BECOME TOO FLUSTERED TO OPERATE IT PROPERLY CAUSING POTENTIALLY EMBARRASSING ERRORS WHICH ONLY SERVE TO CONTINUE THE CYCLE


THE REAL PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T HEAR THE TUTTING OVER THE UNEXPECTED ITEM IN THE BAGGING AREA

HOW WILL THESE PEOPLE LEARN
I DO THIS SOMETIMES TWO REASONS

ONE I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD CARRY ALL MY SHOPPING IN A BASKET IF IT DOESN'T FIT PROPERLY EAST G PIZZA FLOWERS BAGUETTE

TWO I FIND THE INTERACTION WITH THE MACHINE FAR MORE REWARDING AND ENJOYABLE THAN EXPECTING AND LARGELY NOT RECEIVING ANY AUDIBLE INTERACTION WITH CHECKOUT STAFFORDSHIRE
ASDA HAVE STARTED PUTTING IN SELF CHECKOUT LANES SPECIFICALLY FOR PEOPLE WITH TROLLEYS
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS SOMETHING MY MUM AND I DID THE OTHER DAY AT ONLY HAD A FEW ITEMS IN THAT COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN PUT INTO A BASKET BUT I FELL OUT OF A STOPPED FAIRGROUND RIDE AND BUSTED MY KNEES NEEDED THE TROLLEY TO HELP ME WALK AROUND IT DID CAUSE A LITTLE OBSTRUCTION AND AWKWARDNESS BUT THE NORMAL CHECKOUTS WERE RAMMED
IT'S NOT EVEN QUICKER TO DO IT THAT WAY FOR LOTS OF ITEMS SO I FAIL TO SEE THE LOGIC WITH THESE PEOPLE MUST BE THIEVING LITERALLY NO OTHER ADVANTAGE
SOME OLD WOMAN DID THIS AND BLOCKED HALF THE SELF-SERVICE MACHINES IN ASDA SHE WAS LITERALLY BUYING BOWLS AND DID NOT NEED A TROLLEY AT ALL
MY ANSWER IS THIS

BOLLARDS

LIKE WHAT STOP WHEELCHAIRS AND BUGGIES GOING UP ESCALATORS PUT IN A SET OF BOLLARDS SET AT MARGINS NARROWER THAN A TROLLEY BUT EASILY LET BASKETS THROUGH OR OVER

SIMPLE
IT'S NOT REAL BACON ANYWAY JUST A SORT OF FLAVOURED WHEAT STARCH TYPE OF THING SAME WITH THE FLAKY ONION BITS
EGAD IT JUST ISN'T A SALAD UNLESS YOU COVER IT WITH ENOUGH BACON BITS AND CRISPY ONIONS TO CUT YOUR MOUTH TO RIBBONS
AS A PERSON WHO WORKS AT MORRIONS I APOLOGISE
I WANT TO KNOW WHO IT WAS THAT COMPLAINED TO FACOM WHEN ONE OF THE GIRLS GOT A BIT CARRIED AWAY AND FINGERED HERSELF

HELLO IS THAT FACOM

YES HOW CAN WE HELP

WELL I WAS JUST HAVING A WANK WHILE WATCHING BABESTATION WHEN SUDDENLY TO MY HORROR SHE PULLED HER KNICKERS TO THE SIDE AND STARTED VIGOROUSLY RUBBING HER CLITORIS
IT ONLY TAKES YOU ONE VIEWING TO REALISE THEY'RE NEVER GETTING THEIR TITS OUT AND THAT THE INTERNET EXISTS

WHICH ONLY BEGS THE QUESTION HOW ARE THEY STILL MAKING MONEY
BABESTATION IS TO PORNHUB WHAT CEEFAX WAS TO THE INTERNET I EAST IT'S MAINLY FOR OLD GUYS WHO CAN'T WORK COMPUTERS
WHAT'S WORSE IS WHEN YOU FLICK THROUGH THE CHANNELS FOR A GIGGLE AND RECOGNISE THE USUAL FACES THAT ONE GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE THE ANNOYING WOMAN FROM THE SCS ADVERTS MUST HAVE BEEN FLASHING HER APS ON FOREVIEW FOR A DECADE NOW
THAT EERY FEELING WHEN YOU RECOGNISE BABESTATION GIRLS WHEN OUT SHOPPING WITH THE MISSUS
DELETED
MAYBE IT'S A DIFFERENT JOHN LEWIS ADVERTISEMENT
ICELAND IS THE MOST UNDERRATED SUPERMARKET IMO THEIR ADVERTS ARE HITE THOUGH
I CAN'T HANDLE THE AMOUNT OF CHRISTMAS PORN THERE IS ON THE TELLY IN NOVEMBER AT LEAST WAIT UNTIL DECEMBER

IT'S A GRIM TIME OF YEAR WHEN I CAN'T EAT WITH FAMILY WITHOUT BEING EXPOSED TO LAZY YORKSHIRE PUDS OR A SHITTY ICELAND BANQUET I USUALLY HAVE TO BE QUICK OFF THE MARK WITH THE TINY SPRING ROLLS OR I GO HUNGRY
AAH AUNT FOR WHEN YOU'RE TOO FUCKING STUPID TO MIX EGGS MILK FLOUR
DAMMIT I USED TO LOVE THOSE AS WELL
YOU COULD EAT THE STRAW
HOLY SHIT I USED TO LOVE THOSE THINGS I COULD GET THROUGH AN ENTIRE PACK IN ONE GO THEY TASTED AMAZING
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SO YOU CAN HAVE A CARRIER BAG WITH YOUR DENTAL PRODUCT PURCHASE FOR EXACTLY IT'S PURE GENIUS
MY LOCAL PONDOLAND SELLS PRODUCTS FOR OVER
WHY DO THEY DO IT IN PONDOLAND I'M GUESSING YOU'RE IN ENGLAND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST SUPERMARKETS IN ENGLAND

I KNOW IT'S IN MORE SHOPS IN SCOTLAND
I'M SORRY BUT I AM STRUGGLING TO THINK HOW ELSE YOU WOULD CUT BREAD DO YOU MEAN FROM THE SIDE
NONSENSE ALL SANDWICHES MUST BE CUT DIAGONALLY IT ENSURES A SUPERIOR CRUST TO BREAD RATIO
I THINK WE NEED A PICTURE
TURN IT SIDEWAYS MATE JOB DONE

A WHILE BACK I DISCOVERED THIS INTERVIEW WITH BRANDON AND LORI FROM THE US VERSION THEY MENTION A FEW AMUSING THINGS ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF THE OTHER BUYERS ON THE SHOW WHEN YOU READ IT SUDDENLY THE BEHAVIOUR IN THE AUCTIONS MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE
I'VE NEVER WATCHED IT BUT A WHILE AGO WHILE SAT IN THE HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM A COUPLE CAME UP TO ME AND ASK ME IF I WAS DREW FROM THIS SHOW THEY SAID I WAS THE SPITTING IMAGE OF HIM I GOOGLED HIM UP WHEN I GOT HOME AND FOUND OUT I ACTUALLY LOOK NOTHING LIKE HIM
THE US VERSION IS A REAL GUILTY PLEASURE THE UK ONE IN COMPARISON IS DOGSHIP
HEAVY D IS WHAT EVERY MAN SHOULD AIM TO BE
I USED TO WATCH THE US VERSION QUITE A LOT BACK IN THE DAY IT WAS A ENTERTAINING AND SURPRISINGLY INFORMATIVE DESPITE BEING SO EXAGGERATED

I CAUGHT SOME THE UK VERSION RECENTLY AND THEY ARE NOT EVEN TRYING TO HIDE THAT THE SHOW IS FAKE IT'S IMPRESSIVELY BAD IT'S LIKE A PARODY OF A PARODY
MONEY
YOU MEAN THE CONTAINERS AND STORAGE LOCKERS THAT ARE FILLED BY THE SHOWS PRODUCERS AND PASSED OFF AS SOMETHING ELSE BY A GUY BADLY PRETENDING TO BE AN AUCTIONEER
BOOKROOM
THE BOOM GUY HEAVY D OR SOMETHING IS A PROPER ACTOR HE WAS IN DUCK QUACKS DON'T ECHO AND HAS HAD PARTS IN SHORT FILMS AND ADVERTS
THEY DON'T EVEN TRY TO HIDE THE FACT IT'S COMPLETELY FAKE

BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH PAWNS BLAH

MAN CHABUDDY G SHOULD EITHER GO ON IT OR JUST HOST IT
I HATE HOW THE PROFIT MARGIN CALCULATION IS JUST GUESSWORK
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT FROM LAZINESS MAIL FOR LOCAL DELIVERIES DOESN'T LEAVE MAIL CENTRES UNTIL AFTER THE MAIL HAS TO THEN BE RE SORTED AT THE DELIVERY OFFICE READY FOR DELIVERY

THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR YEARS AND JUST ABOUT EVERY POSTIE I KNOW PREFERS THE OLD METHOD OF POST GETS DELIVERED AT BREAKFAST TIME
MY DAD'S A POSTMAN IT WAS BETTER WHEN THE MAIL WAS DELIVERED EARLY COS HE'D BE FINISHED WORK SHORTLY AFTER LUNCH TIME
YOU'RE LUCKY I OFTEN HAVE POST ARRIVE AS LATE AS

A FRIEND'S FATHER ADMITTEDLY A FRENCHMAN WOULD SHAME OVER STAYERS INTO LEAVING BY OFFERING ORANGE JUICE NOT SURE WHETHER IT WOULD WORK ON THIS SIDE OF THE CHANNEL
OH GOSH

NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS BUT THEN ON THE FLIPSIDE YOU WON'T HAVE PEOPLE CRASHING AT YOUR PLACE AS MUCH MAYBE AWWWW
I THINK THE DAILY MASH GOT THE DEFINITIVE WORD ON THIS ONE

PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT CHRISTMAS ADVERTS TOLD ABOUT REST OF HUMAN CULTURE

PEOPLE WHO CANNOT WAIT FOR BIG SHOPS NEW CHRISTMAS TV ADVERTS HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT BOOKS FILMS AND ARTICLE

AMID GROWING ANTICIPATION ABOUT WHETHER THE JOHN LEWIS ADVERT WILL FEATURE A LOVELORN REINDEER OR A SAD ROBIN PEOPLE WHO LOVE CLOYING CORPORATE SENTIMENTALITY HAVE BEEN INFORMED ABOUT HUMANITY S OTHER CULTURAL OUTPUT

PROFESSOR HENRY BRUBAKER OF THE INSTITUTE FOR STUDIES SAID FOR MANY CENTURIES BEFORE HIGH STREET SHOPS STARTED CREATING SECOND SEASONAL NARRATIVES TO SELL JUMPERS MANKIND HAS BEEN TELLING STORIES

THESE STORIES WERE WRITTEN DOWN IN BOOKS WHICH ARE STORED IN LIBRARIES OR ON BOOKSHELVES SOME OF THEM ARE PRETTY GOOD

MUSEUMS ARE ANOTHER GOOD STARTING POINT FOR LEARNING ABOUT THE THINGS HUMANITY HAS CREATED THAT DO NOT INVOLVE AN ANIMATED CREATURE BREATHING ON A WINDOW AND THEN DRAWING A HEART IN THE STEAM

FUCK IT EVEN NETFLIX HAS SOME GOOD STUFF ON IT

NIKKI HOLLIS SAID I ACTUALLY TRIED TO GET THE BOOK VERSION OF THE LAST JOHN LEWIS ADVERT BUT APPARENTLY IT DOESN T EXIST

I HOPE THE NEW ONE IS ABOUT AN OTTER WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH RITA ORA AND THEY HAVE LITTLE HALF-HUMAN FESTIVE OTTER PUPS THEN THEY ALL GO UP IN A BALLOON
IT'S STUPID THEY ARE ALWAYS STUPID

WHY DOES THE LITTLE GIRL STAND THERE LIKE A MELON JUST BECAUSE THE DOG GOT INTO THE TRAMPOLINE FIRST WHY DOES EVERYONE LOOK ON SPEECHLESS BECAUSE A DOG FOUND IT'S WAY INTO A TRAMPOLINE WHY DO ANIMALS WANT TO GET INTO A TRAMPOLINE TO BEGIN WITH

AND LAST YEARS THAT ONE WITH THE OLD GUY STUCK ON THE MOON YEAH THANKS FOR SENDING ME A TELESCOPE SO I CAN FEEL EVEN MORE MISERABLE AND ALONE TRAPPED ON THIS ROCK WHILE YOU BASTARDS CARRY ON HAVING FUN WOULD IT KILL YOU TO GET IN TOUCH WITH NASA SO I CAN GET OFF THIS MOON

WHY AM I SEEING HAS-BEEN CELEBRITIES BUY CHEAP SHIT IN SUPERMARKETS WHEN EVEN THEY CAN AFFORD DECENT FOOD

UGH LIVED IN YORK FOR A WHILE DON'T GO INTO TOWN ON
I LOVE RACE DAYS MY BOYFRIEND AND I WENT TO CHAMPIONS DAY LAST MONTH AND SPENT THE DAY CHINO SPOTTING
THE REAL PROBLEM BEGINS AT THE WORD PRIMARK
I ONCE SAW A MINOTAUR IN THE LOCAL PRIMARK IN MY TOWN IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND A SHIRT STAND HEADING TOWARDS THE BRAS

I ALSO WENT INTO THE MAIN LIVERPOOL PRIMARK ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND WHEN I FINALLY GOT OUT IT WAS ALREADY THE NEXT YEAR
YOU GOT AS FAR AS THE CHECKOUT I USUALLY TRIP OVER THE MOUNDS OF CLOTHES ON THE FLOOR AND GET BURIED UNDER A PILE OF MORE CLOTHES
I WOULDN'T SAY THE EXACT SAME TUNE BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY INSPIRATION THERE
IT IS JUST THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUSNESS RUNNING OUT OF ORIGINAL IDEAS
MPH I PLAYED THE SONG TO HEAR IT AND HAVEN'T STOPPED LISTENING TO ELO SINCE DAMN YOU I WANTED TO WATCH THE
SWEET SIXTEEN CHUCK BERRY SURFIE USA BEACH BOYS
AIRPORT THE MOTORS WORLD OF SPORT OR GRANDSTAND THEME
CAN'T THINK OF ANY MORE EXCEPT MAYBE S MISSISSIPPI BLUES ANYTHING BY LED ZEPPELIN

SAME GOES FOR THE OLD CATCHPHRASE THEME TUNE AND THE SONG FROM THE FILM S FIRE
ONE OF THE HOUSES NEAR ME IS EITHER HAVING A FUCK OFF MASSIVE BONFIRE OR I SHOULD PROBABLY CALL THE FIREMEN
SAME HERE FUCKING ANNOYING WHEN I HEAR MORE THAN THERE WAS ON BONFIRE NIGHT
I JUST HAD TO TURN MY TV UP TO DROWN OUT ALL THE BANGS OUTSIDE
DITTO IT WASN'T EVEN RAINING HERE LAST SATURDAY SO NO FUCKING EXCUSE GOT SCARED PETS SECOND WEEKEND RUNNING
DEAR DO YOU WANT A CUP OF TE PIIIIIIEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOW POFF
ITS WEIRD ON BONFIRE NIGHT AND THE NEXT FEW DAYS I DIDN'T HEAR THAT MANY A FEW GOING OFF HERE AND THERE OBVIOUSLY NEIGHBOURS LETTING OFF A FEW ROCKETS EVEN THE OFFICIAL FIREWORKS DISPLAY ON THE RACECOURSE SEEMED PRETTY QUIET FROM WHERE I LIVE ABOUT A MILE AWAY

LAST NIGHT HOWEVER SOMEONE HAD OBVIOUSLY GOT A HOLD OF HOWITZERS AND TACTICAL NUCLEAR WARHEADS BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE A WARZONE ITS BEEN A WEEK SINCE BONFIRE NIGHT YET THEY SEEM TO BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS NOW
MY HUSBAND WAS STARING ANGRILY OUT THE WINDOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO IT WAS LAST NIGHT NUMBER THEY'RE SETTING THEM OFF IN THE STREET HE WAS ABSOLUTELY NONPLUSSED WHEN I TOLD HIM HE COULDN'T CALL THE POLICE IT'S NOT ILLEGAL AND IT'S PM
BONFIRES ARE PRETTY HARD TO FORGET AND WHO HAS LOADS OF THEM LYING AROUND
WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER WE WOULD KEEP LOADS FOR RANDOM TIMES THROUGH THE YEAR NOBODY EXPECTS A LOAD OF FIRE WORKS TO GO OFF AT ON A TUESDAY IN APRIL I OFTEN LOOK BACK ON THOSE DAYS AND THINK WHAT LITTLE CUNTS ME AND MY MATES WERE
I CAN HAVE RELATE I JUST POSTED THE SAME THING SUBSEQUENTLY DELETED AFTER SEEING THIS POST

FOR ANYONE THAT'S CONFUSED AND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHICH I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY OF YOU CONDESCENDING MEANS TO SPEAK DOWN TO SOMEBODY TO PATRONISE THEM
YOU COULD TRY COMMUNITY RADIO IF YOU LACK THE NECESSARY INFLATED SENSE OF EGO AND A CONDESCENDING TONE DOESN'T COME NATURALLY TO YOU

HOWEVER YOU'LL HAVE TO BE OBSESSED WITH A PARTICULARLY OBSCURE MUSICAL NICHE OR SOMEHOW BE ABLE TO SUMMON THE GRAVITAS REQUIRED FOR PRESENTING A SIX PART SERIES ON THE VARIOUS TYPES OF MANHOLE COVERS FOUND ACROSS THE CITY

IN BOTH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU'LL NEED AN OCCASIONAL GUEST NAMED GEOFF POSSESSED OF THE MOST NASAL VOICE IN HISTORY TO FURTHER DELVE INTO YOUR CHOSEN TOPIC FOR YOUR SEVEN LISTENERS
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS GOOGLE A STATISTIC LIKE OF WOMEN ADMIT TO NOT BRUSHING THEIR TEETH IF THEY ARE IN A HURRY THEN DRAG IT OUT AS A MYSTERY PHONE IN SEGMENT AS YOU ASK PEOPLE TO GUESS WHAT OF WOMEN ADMIT TO DOING WHEN THEY ARE IN A HURRY THEN READ OUT A FEW TWEETS RUN A QUIZ TITLED GUESS THE MYSTERY NOISE AND PLAY SIMPLY RED ONCE AN HOUR PISS EASY

I'D GIVE YOU SOME OF MINE IF I COULD I HAVE LOADS OF THE FUCKING THINGS CLUTTERING UP MY CUPBOARDS
EWHOW
ETD ALSO TAKE HOURS TO PROCESS THEY WILL ONLY GET YOU TO YOUR DESTINATION AND ARE ONLY VALID FOR SPECIFIC JOURNEYS

YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T LOSE IT WITH THE LAST TWO DAYS OF YOUR TRIP

I'D ALSO RECOMMEND NEVER CARRYING YOUR PASSPORT WITH YOU DURING THE DAY HAVE A PHOTOCOPY AND ANOTHER PHOTO ID BUT NEVER YOUR PASSPORT UNLESS YOU SPECIFICALLY NEED IT FOR SOME REASON

FINALLY THIS IS WHAT TRAVEL INSURANCE IS FOR THE CONSULATE IS NOT THERE FOR YOUR EVERY BECK AND CALL
I HEAR YOUR FRUSTRATION BUT THEY'RE THERE FOR THE BIG THINGS LIKE PRISON VISITS TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING LEGAL REPRESENTATION IF ON A CRIMINAL CHARGE SADLY GOVERNMENTAL CUTS MEAN THEY CAN'T RUN A HOLIDAYMAKER CARE SERVICE

IF YOU PAY WITH NOTES THEY HAVE TO COUNT THE CHANGE THAT THEY GIVE YOU BACK THOUGH
THEY LIKE THE FLOAT TO BE FULL OF CHANGE THOUGH DON'T FEEL THAT BAD IF THEY DON'T HAVE CHANGE HOW WOULD YOU EVER GET ANY BACK
MY USUAL REPLY WHEN BEING GIVEN A TON OF CHANGE IT'S ALL MONEY

IT REALLY DOES COME IN HANDY BEATS HAVING A TILL WITH NO CHANGE THEN HAVING TO SCREW ABOUT

UNLESS IT'S SOMEONE HANDING OVER THE MONEY TO MY HAND ONE COIN AT A TIME SCREW THOSE SORTS
YOU'RE NOT ALONE MY SON USED TO COLLECT HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF CHANGE AT A TIME THAT WAY NOW THAT MORE CAN BE DONE WITH CONTACTLESS PAYING HE HAS SMALLER PILES OF COINS ABOUT

I'M STILL DEVASTATED BY THE ONE WITH THE PENGUIN THAT'S AN OVERSTATEMENT I'M ACTUALLY STILL DEVASTATED BY THE CHRISTMAS AD WITH THE WORLD WAR I TRENCH WARFARE THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT
THE ONLY CHRISTMAS AD I CARE ABOUT IS THE COCA COLA ONE
HAS THE MAN ON THE MOON QUIT HIS HABIT OF PEERING INTO GIRLS BEDROOMS
I THINK WE'RE ALL FORGETTING THE MOST IMPORTANT PART ABOUT THIS STUPID CHRISTMAS ADVERTS WAR IT'S BLOODY NOVEMBER
I THINK TERRIBLE IS PUSHING IT A BIT
ARE YOU JOKING THE M S ONE WAS TERRIBLE
NO IDEA HOW THAT ADVERTISES M S

ALSO HOW DOES SHE GET THROUGH THE DOOR
WHY IS IT THAT JOHN LEWIS DON'T EVER FEATURE FATHER CHRISTMAS IN THEIR ADVERTS THE FACT THAT YOU COULD SEE THE DAD ASSEMBLING THE TRAMPOLINE DIALED ME BEFORE IT REALLY GOT STARTED ITS AS IF THEY ARE DENYING HIS PRESENCE HOW OBNOXIOUS
I KEEP MY JAM JARS IN THE FRIDGE AND THEY DON'T GO FURRY EVEN AFTER MONTHS OF BEING OPEN
DON'T PUT BUTTERY CRUMBY KNIVES IN THE JAM THEN
KNIFE FOR BUTTER USE A CLEAN SPOON TO DOLLOP SOME JAM ONTO THE TOAST BUT NEVER IT TOUCH THE BREAD SHOULD MAKE THE JAM LAST FOR AS LONG AS YOU NEED
JAM SHOULDN'T BE GOING FURRY FOR AGES IT HAS SO MUCH SUGAR IN IT MAYBE YOU ARE GETTING BUTTER IN IT AND THAT'S WHAT IS GOING OFF
OPENED JAM GOES IN THE FRIDGE AND UNCOOKED EGGS DO NOT SCHOOLS DO NOT TEACH US ENOUGH
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID MY GRAN PEELING BACK THE FURRY STUFF WHICH SHE BINNED THEN CARRIED ON EATING THE REST OF THE IN AUTHOR NAMES JAMIESON
REFRIGERATE AFTER OPENING THEY SAY THAT ON THE LABEL FOR A REASON
YOU DON'T PUT OPENED JAM IN THE FRIDGE WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL ARE YOU
AS EVERYONE ELSE SAYS PUT THE OPENED JARS IN THE FRIDGE ALSO TRY BUYING THE KIND WITH THE MOST SUGAR YOU CAN FIND
BUY ALL THE TICKETS THEN THE SHITTY CHEESE FROM ICELAND WILL BE YOURS
YOU NEED TO HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE DUDE
I'M PANICKING WHEN I'M DOWN TO MY LAST
R SMALLJARPROBLEMS
SAINTSBURY RED LABEL WHICH I THINK ARE REALLY NICE COME IN LITTLE FOIL SLEEVES INSIDE THE BIG BOX
YOUR FIRST MISTAKE IS USING PG TIPS
2 WORDS DIPLOIC BAG
MAN I WAS BROUGHT UP ON PEGTOPS
HOW IS THAT A PROBLEM DO YOU NORMALLY BUY TINY BOXES OF TEA BAGS WHICH ALL FIT IN YOUR TEA JAR AT ONCE
NO STOP IT PG TIPS ARE WEAK YOU NEED 2 BAGS TO GET A DECENT BREW AND THEY STILL TASTE HORRENDOUS GET SOME YORKSHIRE TEA DOWN YOU
YOU STRANGE STRANGE MAN
THE CRINGE WAS CLARKSON CHATTING UP LITTLE MIX
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO OF THE WORST SHOWS ON UK TV THERE
TOILET BRUSHES ARE HORRIBLY UNHYGIENIC
THAT'S WHY I BRING MY OWN WHEN I GO ON HOLIDAY

GOOD OL
HOW ELSE ARE YOU MEANT TO BREAK MISTER BACK
YOU HAVE TO USE THOSE WASTEFUL WIPES INSTEAD THAT DON'T BREAK DOWN LIKE TOILET TISSUE AND CAUSE POTENTIALLY MASSIVE PROBLEMS FOR THE DRAINS
I DIDN'T GET ROUND TO BUYING ONE
HI BRITAIN FIRST WILL BE HEARING ABOUT THIS

VANS ARE BEING SENT ROUND
GET AN A4 SHEET OF PAPER AND MAKE A TEMPORARY ONE
NO RESPECT
MY MUM BUYS TWO SPARES FOR THIS VERY REASON SHE CAN'T BEAR TO THINK WHAT PEOPLE IN PUBLIC WILL THINK OF HER IF SHE'S NOT GOT A POPPY ON IN NOVEMBER NOT BECAUSE SHE'S ALL ABOUT KEEPING UP APPEARANCES BUT BECAUSE THERE IS THIS PRESSURE TO WEAR ONE
I WARN YOU NOT TO USE THAT FEEBLE EXCUSE I'M AFRAID IT WON'T WASH
I LIVE ALONE AND DON'T HAVE A JOB RIGHT NOW I DIDN'T EVEN REALISE IT WAS REMEMBRANCE DAY UNTIL YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
I LOST TWO POPPIES TODAY IT WAS ATTACHED TO MY COAT FELL OFF WHEN I WAS WALKING OUTSIDE RINSE AND REPEAT
OR YOU COULD TELL PEOPLE TO MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS
DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT FOR ME THE MEDIA HAVE GOT AWAY FOR YEARS BY QUOTING EXPERTS WHO MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN JUST SOME GUY IN THE PUB WHO HAPPENED TO HAVE AN OPINION
COM IS INTENDED FOR COMMERCIAL WEBSITES NOT ANY PARTICULAR NATION
OH NO
MOST UK COMPANIES WOULD PREFER COM OVER MUCH WIDER REACH
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND ANY BRITISH COMPANIES WHO HAVEN'T ALSO BOUGHT UP THE COM DOMAIN TO THEIR ADDRESS OTHERWISE THEY'LL BE MISSING OUT ON VISITORS FROM PEOPLE THEIR ADDRESS AND OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO THE RISK OF SOMEONE ELSE REGISTERING IT
STILL DISAPPOINTED WITH BBC MOVING ACROSS TO COM THEY WERE THE LAST BASTION IN MY EYES SNIFF
YET COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE AND AMAZON HAVE DOMAINS TOO THEY'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE
I'M CONFUSED
AS A WEB DEVELOPER A BIT OF ME DIES WHEN A NEW CLIENT BUYS A COM TRANSFERRING THEM IS SO HARD IN COMPARISON TO A
I ALWAYS HATED THAT ACAS WAS AT SHOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN
BAUD
I LIKE HIM ON IN AND OUT OF THE KITCHEN
CRAP I'VE JUST REALISED I'VE SENT A WORK EMAIL OUT AT HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT TO EVERYONE THAT I COMPLETELY FORGOT TO OBSERVE THE SILENCE THIS YEAR
I LOST MY JOB FOR OBSERVING 2 MINUTES SILENCE

THAT WAS MY CAREER AS A CALL HANDLER OVER FOR GOOD

YOU REMEMBERED THEM IN YOUR OWN WAY POISONOUS GAS WAS A HUGE KILLER
COULD YOU NOT HAVE TURNED IT INTO THE LAST POST
I WAS SHOPPING IN ALDI WHEN I NOTICED EVERYONE HAD STOPPED AND WAS STARING INTO THE MIDDLE DISTANCE I WAS REALLY FREAKED OUT FOR A MOMENT LIKE IN SOME KIND OF BAD SCI-FI WHERE EVERYONE ELSE FREEZES IN TIME AND THEIR EYES GLAZE OVER I ASKED A SHOP ASSISTANT WHAT CHAS GOING ON AND SHE SAID TWO MINUTES SILENCE

OH SHIT I TOTALLY FORGOT AND LOOKED LIKE AN ASS WEAVING BETWEEN OBSERVANT GRANNIES TO REACH THE COFFEE
I WILL STILL ASLEEP SO TECHNICALLY OBSERVED THE SILENCE
WE WERE DRIVING DURING THE TWO MINUTE SILENCE

UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS RUINED BY MY OTHER HALF TRYING TO GET ON A ROUNDABOUT SAYING FUCKING INDICATE THEN YOU MASSIVE CUNT
SOMEONE IN LONDON HONKED THEIR HORN IN THE TWO MINUTES SILENCE BEING BROADCAST LIVE FROM TRAFALGAR SQUARE
I WAS POOPING IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER AT ABOUT MINUTES TO IT WAS LITERALLY A CASE OF GO NOW OR SHIT MYSELF BY I WAS TELLING THE TODDLER NOT TO HURT THE CAT I FIGURE I CAN DO MY OWN REMEMBRANCE SILENCE LATER WHEN THE CHILD IS SLEEPING
I WAS IN MY SIXTH FORM CENTRE AND THERE WERE TWO GUYS LOUDLY DISCUSSING POKEMON THEY GOT THE HINT AFTER ALL THE DIRTY LOOKS
I WAS AT WORK ADVISING A CUSTOMER ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE JUST SAID YOU HAVE TO BE SILENT ABOUT SECONDS IN MY PHONE NOTIFICATION GOES ON WHICH IS SHIA LABEOUF SHOUTING JUST DO IT BTW SHE GAVE ME SUCH A LOOK AND AFTER THE SILENCE ENDED SHE WALKED OUT TURNS OUT THE MESSAGE WAS FROM MY FRIEND TELLING ME I HAD TO BE SILENT CHEERS MATE
DOES EVERYONE'S WORKPLACES OBSERVE IT I'VE WORKED IN A COUPLE OF OFFICES AND NEITHER ONE SEEMS TO MAKE A DEAL OF IT I ALWAYS TRY AND REMAIN SILENT BUT SOMETIMES SOMEONE WILL JUST ENGAGE YOU AND YOU CAN'T EXACTLY IGNORE THEM IT DOES ANNOY ME
I WORK IN A SUPERMARKET THEY ANNOUNCED TWICE WE'D BE DOING IT THEN ONCE MORE AT TO SAY IT HAD STARTED AND YET SOME PEOPLE WERE STILL PUSHING THEIR TROLLEYS AROUND AND I COULD HEAR SOMEONE SOMEWHERE TALKING EVERYONE ELSE HAD STOPPED AND WAS SILENT SO YOU WOULD THINK PEOPLE WOULD GET THE HINT AND SHH IT'S NOT LIKE STOPPING FOR TWO MINUTES IS GOING TO RUIN YOUR DAY
I WAS BLEEDING DURING THE SILENCE AT LEAST THE APPOINTMENT WAS EASY TO REMEMBER
IT'S ALMOST AS BAD AS THE TWO GUYS IN MY OFFICE WHO SPENT THE TWO MINUTES COMPLAINING THAT THAT THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFFICIAL ONLY TO REALISE WHEN IT WENT OFF A SECOND TIME THAT IT WAS MEANT TO BE THE 2 MINUTES SILENCE
I WAS LEANING AGAINST MY DESK DURING A DAILY STANDS UP MEETING THOUGHT I'D LET ONE SLIP QUIETLY INSTEAD MY BUM CHEEKS SQUEEZED TOGETHER BY THE TABLE TRUMPETED UP THE SMALL OF MY BACK
IT'S OK THERE'S ANOTHER ONE ON SUNDAY SEE IF YOU CAN RESTRAIN YOURSELF THEN
AS LONG AS IT WAS A SILENT ONE
BOSS TOLD US WE COULD TAKE PART IN THE 2 MINUTE SILENCE AT MID CONVERSATION WITH A BORROWER SADLY THE GAVE NOT A SINGLE FUCK SO I HAD TO CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION
BONUS POINTS IF YOU DO IT INTO A BUGLE
I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT IT I WAS TOO BUSY REVVING UP MY STONE SAW AT WORK CUTTING THROUGH CONCRETE OOPS
REMINDS ME OF THE SEX DEATH AND NUDITY EPISODE OF COUPLING
PEOPLE IN MY OFFICE DIDN'T EVEN OBSERVE THE SILENCE SOME OF US DID BUT A COUPLE OTHERS KEPT NATTERING AWAY
TRUMP
I WAS LEAVING A SEMINAR AND HEADING TO ANOTHER ONE THAT STARTS AT WITH SOME COURSE MATES AND ONLY REALISED AS WE'D WALKED UP FLIGHTS OF STAIRS IN A BUSY UNI BUILDING

IT WAS AWFUL WE OBSERVED IT BUT SOMETHING FELT WRONG ABOUT WALKING ON THE OTHER HAND AS SCORES OF BRITISH STUDENTS STOOD STILL A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WALKED AROUND AND TALKED NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT WAS HAPPENING
FUCK YOU I STOOD UP WHEN THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF AND SHOUTED AT EVERYONE TO GET UP I'M A FIRE MARSHALL AT WORK AND WASN'T NOTIFIED OF A DRILL AND WAS CONVINCED IT WAS THE REAL THING
GAS GAS GAS
YIKES
I THINK YOU MEAN YOU TRUMPED
I WENT TO WATCH THE MEMORIAL SERVICE AT THE CENOTAPH IN EDINBURGH A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

AS THE MILITARY BAND WAS MARCHING OFF PAST THE THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS OF PUBLIC FIRST MINISTER ARMY TOP BRASS IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING WAS AMISS

OVER THE SOUND OF BAGPIPES CAME A PARADE GROUND ROAR

BANG THAT FUCKING DRUM
OURS WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFICULT TO STAY SERIOUS FOR TODAY BECAUSE THE BUILDERS OUTSIDE WERE SINGING THE FRESH PRINCE INTRODUCTION
SALUTING TRUMP IN THE MINUTE SILENCE

BRAVE
IT'S ALL STUPID ANYWAY THE ARMISTICE TOOK AFFECT AT PARIS TIME
MY AMERICAN COLLEAGUE STARTED TALKING AT THE NEXT MINUTE WAS RESPONSES FROM A BRIT AND A GERMAN AND ANOTHER BRIT TALKING
I WANT TO DOWNVOTE YOU FOR DISRESPECT I CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY
LAST YEAR I HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE TWO MINUTES SILENCE

I ONLY REALISED AFTER I HAD BARGED MY WAY THROUGH A MALL FULL OF SHOPPERS STOOD PERFECTLY STILL INTO A CAF FULL OF SILENT CUSTOMERS AND THEN I TRIED TO BREAK THE SILENCE BY SITTING DOWN NEXT TO MY FRIENDS AND MIMICKING A TUMBLEWEED SOUND

I'M A FUCKING IDIOT
DURING THE SILENCE WE HAD FOR THE SEPTEMBER ATTACKS AT MY SCHOOL SHOWING MY AGE HERE TOWARDS THE END OF DOUBLE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND JUST AFTER THE BELL TO SIGNAL THE START WENT MY FRIEND LET ONE OFFICIAL TO THIS DAY I'M CONVINCED IT WAS PARTIALLY DELIBERATE BECAUSE HE SEEMED REALLY PROUD WITH HIMSELF AND OF COURSE MYSELF AND OUR OTHER FRIEND GOT CAUGHT IN A GIGGLE LOOP WITH HIM

MOST UNCOMFORTABLE ATTEMPT AT A SILENCE EVER AND AFTERWARDS OUR TEACHER SINGLED ME OUT AND SAID I EXPECTED BETTER FROM YOU SUPERVILLAININDIANA YOU'RE REALLY NOT ALLOWED TO FUCK UP WHEN YOU'RE CONSIDERED A MODEL PUPIL

I GUESS MY POINT IS FOR A FEW PEOPLE YOU POTENTIALLY MADE THAT SILENCE MEMORABLE NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE RIGHT REASONS
2 MINUTE SILENCE
EDIT VMD GOOGLE
FOR BRITAIN
THIS THREAD IS DISGUSTING THESE PEOPLE DIED FOR YOU AND YOU REPAY THEM WITH THIS YOU'RE A CUNT
FOR FUCKS SAKE
HAVE A CHILD VERY USEFUL FOR THOSE SORTS OF SITUATIONS
TUT TYPICAL
I SHUDDER EVERY TIME I SEE OR HEAR THE WORD CUPPA BUT I FEEL YOU PAIN
YA KNOW WITHOUT FAIL I DO THIS EVERY NIGHT MAKE MY MRS A CUPPA FOR BED THEN IT'S PC TIME FOR ME NO SHIT I LEAVE MINE ON THE STAIRS OR IN THE KITCHEN EVERY TIME OF COURSE REALISING I'VE LEFT IT SOMEWHERE AFTER GETTING SAT DOWN AND SORTED MAYBE ONE DAY I'LL REMEMBER
I REGULARLY DO THIS AND ATTEMPT TO USE MY POWERS OF TELEKINESIS TO RETRIEVE IT APPARENTLY I DON'T HAVE ANY POWERS OF TELEKINESIS
GETS UP GRABS CUPPA SITS BACK DOWN

HMM COULD DO WITH SOME BACCIES DAGNABBIT
YOU UTTER IN THE BIBLE TITUS
THIS IS THE FIRST ONE OF THESE THAT HAS NOT JUST MADE ME LAUGH BUT CUT TO THE QUICK
UNLESS YOU WERE SNORING
A FEW YEARS AGO SOMEONE IN MY CLASS DIDN'T HEAR THE BELL GO FOR THE TWO MINUTES SILENCE AND STARTED TALKING HALFWAY THROUGH AFTER BEING HIT IN THE HEAD BY THE BLIND THE CLASS WAS NOT AMUSED
HAVE YOURSELF A CHEEKY LITTLE CHRISTMAS
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHO IS GOING OUT TO EAT ON CHRISTMAS DAY I DON'T KNOW ANYONE THAT DOES DON'T GET ME WRONG I ENJOY THE DOZEN OR SO WARM UP DINNERS YOU NEED TO HAVE AND I AM HAPPY TO EAT THEM OUT I DO ENJOY THE REALLY SHIT ONES AT SPOONS BUT NOT ON THE DAY ITSELF
I USED TO WORK FOR BANDOS AND GOT TOLD BY A CUSTOMER I WAS RUINING HER FAMILIES CHRISTMAS BECAUSE WE WEREN'T OPEN
I FEEL SORRY FOR PEOPLE WORKING THERE ON CHRISTMAS
WHEN I WAS A KID I THINK THE TURKEY WAS EITHER DROPPED OR BURNT AND WE HAD TO GET A CHINESE IN PROBABLY MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS DINNER ACTUALLY ALTHOUGH I'M STILL PRETTY IMPRESSED THEY MANAGED TO FIND ONE OPEN
WORKED AS A WAITER FOR A FEW YEARS IN THE LATE SOUTH CAN CONFIRM THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE EAT CHRISTMAS DINNER AT RESTAURANTS
IT DOES DEPEND ON THE LOCATION OF THE IF ITS AN AREA OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS
I USED TO THINK GOING OUT WAS A BIT WEIRD BUT LAST YEAR I SPENT HALF OF NOVEMBER IN HOSPITAL AND IT TURNED OUT ALMOST ALL OF THE NURSING STAFF I SPOKE WITH HAVE RELIED ON PUB CARVER RESTAURANT CHRISTMAS DINNERS IN ORDER TO HAVE SOMETHING NICE IN THE PAST AND IT MADE ME THINK

CHRISTMAS DINNER AT BANDOS THOUGH EW NUMBER
BOTH MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN HAVE DONE HOSPITALITY CHRISTMAS DAY IS BOOKED UP IN ADVANCE AND IS USUALLY HEAVING THE ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT MOST PLACES OFFER LUNCH ON AND CLOSE FOR THE EVENING MOST LOCAL PUBS THEN CLOSE BOXING DAY
HERE'S A LIST OF ALL THE MCDONALDS WHICH WERE OPEN LAST CHRISTMAS DAY

UNHOME WHATMAKESMCDONALDS ARTICLES
WE WERE THINKING ABOUT IT THIS YEAR AS BOTH MY MOTHER AND MOTHER IN LAW PASSED AWAY RECENTLY BUT WE DECIDED IT WOULD BE WEIRD AS WE WOULD BE MISERABLE AND EVERYONE ELSE CHEERFUL
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST CAN YOU IMAGINE EATING CHRISTMAS DINNER AT BANDOS
I WILL HAVE THE ROAST CHICKEN WRAP WITH LEMON AND HERB CHIPS AND A WATER CUP

YEP SOUNDS PERFECT
CHEEKY BANDOS

FAFFY
BOOKED IN AT THE BEEFEATER THIS YEAR BUT ONLY BECAUSE CAU AT THE DOCKS HAS BEEN FULLY BOOKED FOR MONTHS YOU WIN SOME YOU LOSE SOME
PERFECT FOR IF YOU WANT A SHIT CHRISTMAS
I WAS OFF TODAY BUT A GIRL IN OUR OFFICE BERATED MY HUSBAND IN THE ROOM NEXT DOOR FOR NOT BEING QUIET SHE DID IT BY EMAIL WHILST SHE WAS OBSERVING THE SILENCE MY HUSBAND ASKED IF HER OFFICE WAS IN A DIFFERENT TIME ZONE AS IT WAS ONLY SHE WAS A BIT EMBARRASSED
THE SILENCE IN OUR OFFICE WAS SOMEWHAT MARRED BY THE CACOPHONY OF UNANSWERED PHONES
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE
DID YOU TRY TO GRAB IT ONE THE WAY DOWN AND IN DOING SO CAUSE A LOT MORE NOISE THAN IF YOU JUST LET IT FALL
TWO MINUTES ONE IS SUFFICIENT OTHERWISE THE TEA GETS A BIT MILD
WHAT'S WRONG WITH TH

OH
I'VE SEEN TWO POSTS TODAY ABOUT REMEMBERING THOSE WHO THOUGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY
AND

PLS OPEL PROPYL INIT
IT'S THE ONLY TIME OF THE YEAR WHERE ANYONE INCLUDING THE LESS ELOQUENT USE THE WORD LEST
AND

PEOPLE DIED FOR PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO INCORRECTLY RESPECT THEM
LESSWEFORGET IS KICKING ABOUT TOO
WELL AT LEAST THEY'RE MAKING THEIR TOKEN GESTURES REALLY TOKEN
I'M TRYING TO THINK WHAT LEAST WE FORGET COULD EVEN MEAN

LIKE DOES ANYONE EVER THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ANYMORE
SOMEONE ON MY FACEBOOK POSTED LEAST WE FORGET INSERT POPPY SYMBOL I'M NOT EVEN JOKING
AT LEAST AUTOCORRECT DIDN'T CHANGE IT TO
NO NO NO NO NO NO
SPELLING GATE
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THINGS TRENDING ON TWITTER I DIDN'T EVEN REALISE THEY HAD IT ANYMORE
I WATCHED MORDECAI LAST NIGHT DOES THAT COUNT

TRIED GROWING A MUSTACHE ONCE NO ONE NOTICED WHILE I HAD IT NO ONE NOTICED WHEN I SHAVED IT OFFICIAL

I MAY NOT ACTUALLY EXIST THOUGH
THOSE OF US THAT CAN HAVE A FULL BEARD THESE DAYS
IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE FACIAL HAIR IS NOW SO FASHIONABLE SO LOADS OF BLOKES HAVE ALREADY GOT MOUSTACHES A PAL OF MINE IS DOING IT HE'S A TUBA PLAYER AND PREFERS PREFERS TO BE CLEAN SHAVEN NORMALLY
I THOUGHT THE MESSAGE WAS ANTI MALE SUICIDE
I'M NORMALLY BEARDED AND NORMALLY PARTICIPATE IN NOVEMBER HAVE RAISED A GOOD FEW HUNDRED QUID OVER THE YEARS BUT I SIMPLY FORGOT THIS YEAR

I DIDN'T REALISE FOR A FEW DAYS AND AS IT TAKES ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO REALLY KICK IN AND I HAD A COUPLE OF MEETINGS LINED UP I DIDN'T BOTHER
FULL BEARD HERE
IT'S NOVEMBER NOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO EXERCISE FOR AWARENESS GET WITH THE PROGRAM
IF YOU LIKE I'LL START WAXING MINE SO IT'S MORE OBVIOUS I'M DOING IT FOR NOVEMBER INSTEAD OF JUST BEING BEARDED

MY FRIEND SHAVED HIS BEARD TO HAVE A HULK HOGAN MO
NOVEMBER IS IN AID OF MALE SUICIDE AWARENESS MEN ARE OVERWHELMINGLY MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE SO THIS RAISES AWARENESS OF THAT AND ENCOURAGES MEN WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN ENCOURAGED TO BOTTLE THEIR FEELINGS UP UNTIL BREAKING POINT TO TALK TO PEOPLE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE

HOWEVER THEY CAN'T BE DOING A GOOD JOB IF LOADS OF PEOPLE THINK IT'S A CANCER THING

EDIT I STAND CORRECTED IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S A GENERAL MEN'S HEALTH THING MAYBE THE EMPHASIS CHANGES YEAR TO YEAR
YOU CAN BUY AN ENTIRE READY TO EAT COOKED CHICKEN FOR ADMITTEDLY NOT QUITE AS PORTABLE BUT GUARANTEED TO LAST YOU LONGER THAN SECONDS PRO-RATA ON PRICE OR MINUTE PRO-RATA ON WEIGHT
TOP TIP TO SAVE MONEY ON FRIDGE RAIDERS APPLY A MIX OF LARD BREAD-CRUMB AND SALT TO CARDBOARD THAT HAS BEEN LEFT TO SOAK OVERNIGHT YOU'LL FIND THE TASTE TEXTURE AND NUTRITIONAL CONTENT TO BE IDENTICAL
THEY ARE BOTH DISGUSTING AND DELICIOUS IN EQUAL MEASURES
SELL CHICKEN DANANG BITES ON THE DELI COUNTER THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY THE SAME THING AND ARE ABOUT FOR MUCH BETTER AND TASTE LESS LIKE LARDY SALTY BREADCRUMBED CARDBOARD TOO
ASDA ARE DOING CHICKEN DIPPERS FOR GRANTED YOU NEED AN OVEN TO COOK THEM
YOU ONLY GET BITS NOW

WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG
SO CALLED BECAUSE YOU'LL BE IMMEDIATELY RAIDING THE FRIDGE AFTERWARDS TO GET SOME FOOD

BE BETTER OFF GOING INTO PONDOLAND AND BUYING WHATEVER RANDOM COOKED MEAT OFFERINGS THEY GOT
BE CAREFUL EATING THEM TOO FAST I NEARLY BROKE A TOOTH ON A LARGE BONE IN ONE NOT HAD ANY SINCE IT WAS A BIT OFF-PUTTING
I PAID ABOUT A QUID FOR A SNACK PACK OF NUTS AND RAISINS AND SEEDS THEY WENT IN ABOUT SECONDS TURNS OUT THE RECOMMENDED PORTION SIZE WAS ABOUT A QUARTER OF THIS TINY BAG I WORKED OUT I HAD ABOUT CALORIES AND A WHOLE DUCKTOWN OF MY DAILY CALORIE INTAKE HEALTHY MY ARSE I'D HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF WITH A CHEESEBURGER
AS MY SON ALWAYS SAYS MUM CAN I HAVE SOME MORE I ATE IT TOO FAST
FOR A BETTER VALUE PROPOSITION JUST EAT A PACKET OF HAM SLICES WITH YOUR FINGERS LIKE A HEATHEN
USUALLY YOU CAN BUY BIGGER PACKS IN THE REFRIGERATED AREA WHERE YOU BUY PARTY SAUSAGES AND STUFF
FOR 2 YOU CAN GET FRESH COOKED ONES FROM THE DELI AT
COME ON MAN ROOKIE ERROR GET THEM IN THE MEAL DEAL INSTEAD OF CRISPS WATCH THE PRICE COME DOWN BY AFTER DISCOUNTS AND EAT YOUR FREE CHICKEN
THE ONE TIME I ATE FRIDGE A RAIDERS I HAD A WEIRD ALLERGIC REACTION GOT COVERED IN HIVES AND ENDED UP HAVING TO TAKE SOME RATHER STRONG ANTIHISTAMINES WHICH KNOCKED ME COMPLETELY SIDEWAYS FOR ALMOST HOURS

MIGHT TRY AGAIN
THEY ARE LEGIT SUCH A RIPOFF THE FRIED CHICKEN ONES ARE SO GOOD THOUGH
I ALWAYS SKIP THE FRIDGE RAIDERS AND HEAD FOR THE BRANSON BITES DECKLE
REMINDS ME OF THE GODDAMN BURGER KING AT CHARING CROSS I WAS AND IT WAS THE FIRST PLACE IN MY LINE OF SIGHT AND THOSE CHICKEN STRIPS LOOKED ALRIGHT WAIT CHICKEN STRIPS AND SOME SHITTY DIP FOR FIVE BLOODY POUNDS

IT JUST ISN'T RIGHT
THINK I'D RATHER EAT A PEPERAMI AND ACTUALLY TASTE SOMETHING
THEY ARE A GUILTY PLEASURE BUT THEY'RE ONLY REALLY WORTH IT WHEN ON SPECIAL OFFER
YOU ABSOLOOT MAD MAN
YOU MONSTER
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
R BADLANDS
TODAY I DISCOVERED THAT HANK MARVIN IS WELL KNOWN ENOUGH IN THE UK TO SELL FROZEN CHICKEN NUGGETS

IN THE US HANK MARVIN IS KNOWN TO PRIMARILY ONLY TO GUITAR GEEKS
STRADDLE BOTH CENTRAL LANES
THE IDEA IS TO STAY IN THE RIGHTMOST LANE SO YOU FORCE EVERYONE INTO THE RIGHTMOST LANE TO PASS YOU

ON A LANE ROAD THEY ARE IN ORDER LORRIES SLOW CARS YOU IDIOTS

S
THE FAR RIGHT APPARENTLY

I SWEAR TO GOD IF I COME ACROSS ANOTHER PERSON DOING IN THE OUTSIDE LANE OF THAT STRETCH I'M GOING TO PRETEND I'M ON A BUMPER CAR TRACK
MIDLAND HOGGING ON THE IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF OVERTAKING EACH OTHER AT A GLACIAL PACE

CLOG UP THE FAST LANE WITH EVERYONE ELSE DOING WHILE THE HARDSHOULDER LANE IS LEFT DESERTED
DO WHAT I DO AND DRIFT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN LANES 2 AND FOR THAT PLEASING SLALOM FEEL
THE SECOND TO RIGHT LANE THE FAST LANE IS FOR AND ABOVE TECHNICALLY YOU CAN HOG THE FAST LANE BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE CONSISTENTLY ABOVE AT LEAST BUT PREFERABLY EVEN THEN MAKE WAY FOR THE INEVITABLE AUDI GOING AT MIDDLE LANE IS IDEALLY MPH AND ABOVE IF THERE'S SPACE IN FRONT OF YOU BUT DON'T MAKE A HABIT OF UNDERTAKING THOSE IN THE FAST LANE AS ITS NOT THE SAFEST THING TO DO AND DON'T BE A DICKHEAD AND TAILGATE IF THE PERSON AHEAD IS DOING MPH IN THE MIDDLE LANE OVERTAKE ON THE RIGHT LANE IF YOU WANT TO GO FASTER

THE OTHER TWO LANES ARE ONLY FOR LORRIES AND SLOTWISE OR IF YOU'RE GETTING OFF SOON I SUPPOSE

MOSTLY IT ALL GOES TO SHIT WITH THE TRAFFIC AND CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY IF YOU CAN GET TO AT ALL AND EVENTUALLY YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF IN THE SUCK THE ENDLESS ZONES WITH NARROW LANES
I REALISE THERE IS A LOT OF S IN THIS THREAD BUT MY GOD THE AMOUNT OF FUCKTARDS MIDDLE LANE HOGGING ON THE REALLY BOILS MY PISS

AND THE A1 AND THE AND THE CUNTS
BOTH MIDDLE LANES
AH I SEE YOU'VE ENTERED THE WORLD OF RECURSIVE PARCEL COLLECTING FROM WHICH THERE IS NO END OR ESCAPE
JUST TO ADD TO MY ORIGINAL FRUSTRATION A BIT MORE THIS IS ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER RM BROKE THE TOP OF MY POT OFF TO HIDE A PARCEL BEHIND IT WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SIGNED FOR WHEN I WAS IN PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE

A SW
AH WHAT AN ACCURATE PORTRAIT OF OUR GRAND NATIONAL PARCEL DELIVERY SERVICES
SOME SUGGESTIONS

SEND EVERYTHING TO WORK
2 ORDER EVERYTHING ON THE SAME DAY AND BOOK THAT DAY OFF WORK
DON'T ORDER ANYTHING
BECOME A HERMIT AND NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE
THEY'RE ALL BLOODY USELESS OF LATE

YODEL DELIVERED TO OUR SHOP THREE DAYS RUNNING I WAS SHOCKED

FOURTH DAY NIPPED TO POST OFFICE FOR SOMETHING ABOUT SEVEN SHOPS DOWN THE ROAD CAME BACK WITH AN UNEXPECTED PARCEL THAT HAD BEEN DROPPED OFF THERE THAT SHE COULD BARELY LIFT

YODEL HAD DROPPED IT AT POST OFFICE THAT OPENS AFTER OUR SHOP DOES MOST LIKELY HAD A QUEUE

GO FIGURE
HOW THE HELL DOES THIS EVEN HAPPEN
A MILE AWAY MY CLOSEST WHICH WAS A MILE AWAY TURNED INTO MILES
DID THE MACHINE TELL YOU TO STOP OR STAFF
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THIS THREAD FOR MAKING ME AWARE THAT SUPERMARKETS ARE YET ANOTHER PLACE THAT I NEED TO AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE COME A MASCULINE ON TO SUMMARISE IN A LENGTHY FASHION THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THIS DAY

PEOPLE IN THE ARMED FORCES DIED FOR THINGS I NOW ENJOY FOR THIS I AM GRATEFUL
SOMEONE OR MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS DECIDED HEY WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM BY CONCEIVED THE WHOLE THING ABOUT DONNING A RED FLOWER WITH A THORN AND HAVING A MOMENT OF SILENCE TO STAND IN REMEMBRANCE OF THOSE WHO DIED THIS IS ALSO FINE
NOWADAYS I SEE POPPIES HANDED OUT BY SERVICE PEOPLE I FIND THIS PRACTICE TO BE COERCIVE AND MILDLY INTIMIDATING HEY YOU WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A POPPY I COULD DIE FOR YOUR SINS YOU KNOW WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING YOUR MANDATORY FREEDOM POPPY THIS IS OF COURSE AN EXAGGERATION THAT ONLY PLAYS OUT IN MY HEAD
I'D FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH CIVILIANS COLLECTING FOR POPPIES THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE CIVILIAN THANKFULNESS FOR THE SERVICE OF THOSE IN THE ARMED FORCES
ABOUT THAT MOMENT OF SILENCE IT'S NO LONGER SIMPLE ACT OF REMEMBRANCE IT HAS BECOME AN OPPRESSIVE RITUAL GOD FORBID IF YOU ARE NOT COMPLETELY SILENT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR THE NEXT TWO MINUTES AND SO HELP YOU IF FOR REASONS BEYOND YOUR CONTROL YOU MAKE A NOISE RELEVANT THREAD OR CAUSE A NOISE TO BE MADE LIKE OP PREPARE TO BE CHASTENED BY THE FOR YOUR CRIME YOU WILL BE GLARED AT TUTTED AND GENERALLY OPPRESSED
NOT ONE OF MY FAMILY OR FRIENDS HAS BEEN WOUNDED OR KILLED IN ANY WAR NEXT TO NONE OF THEM ARE IN THE ARMED FORCES THEREFORE IT SHOULDN'T BE INCONCEIVABLE THAT I DON'T FEEL ANY EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO DIED I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA HOW IT FEELS TO LOSE A LOVED ONE IN A WAR SO I CAN'T EMPATHIES WITH YOU THAT NONE OF MY FAMILY OR FRIENDS HAVE DIED IN WAR IS LARGELY DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN KEEPING THEM SAFE

I ONCE WORKED AT A PLACE WHERE AN ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM INVITES YOU TO JOIN A THE TWO-MINUTE SILENCE LET'S BE CLEAR THAT WAS NOT AN INVITATION YOU WOULD BE SILENT OR YOU WOULD BE OSTRACISE YOU COULD HEAR A PIN DROP DURING THEIR SILENCES I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I TESTED IT WITH THE PIN FROM MY POPPY THAT PIN WAS LOUD AFTER SAID SILENCE PEOPLE COMPLAINED ON THE INTERNAL FORUM THAT SOMEONE WAS TYPING DURING THE SILENCE THEY SPOKE TYPED AS IF THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE HAD JUST PISSED ON THEIR SON'S GRAVE OUT OF SPITE

I FEEL BETTER HAVING GOTTEN THIS OFF MY CHEST I'M RELIEVED MY NEW JOB AT A SMALL COMPANY IS NOT SO FUSSED ABOUT ALL OF THIS
SO WHY NOT JUST PUT THE ITEM DOWN TO STOP IT
FUCKING ROBOTS NO RESPECT
I HAD ONE TODAY ASK ME IF THE PRICE OF THE ITEM WAS CORRECT NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE I DON'T FUCKING KNOW MACHINE I BOUGHT A LOT OF SHIT
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TURN DOWN THE VOLUME ON THE TILL
SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO PROGRAM THE MACHINE TO BECOME DEAD SILENT AT PRECISELY THAT DATE AND TIME EVERY YEAR CAN'T BE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE
THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY MUM A FEW YEARS AGO SHE HAD TO ENDURE TWO MINUTES OF THE WHOLE OF TESCO GLARING AT HER AS THE MACHINE NAGGED HER ABOUT UNEXPECTED ITEMS AND ASKING IF SHE WISHED TO CONTINUE WHILE SHE STOOD THERE HELPLESSLY
A VOICE OF DISSENT IN A LAND OF MASS JINGOIST HYSTERIA
YOU KNOW YOU CAN MUTE THE MACHINES
YOU SAID THEN TELL YOUR MACHINE TO STOP TALKING IT WASN'T ME

WAIT DID SHE SHOW YOU A SIGN STATING YOU HAD TO BE QUIET OR DID SHE TELL YOU

IF SHE TOLD YOU I HOPE EVERYONE GLARED AT HERALDRY
THAT MACHINE NEEDS TO BE RETIRED
IF THEY'RE A CUNT I DON'T SAY THANK YOU
I HAVE ALWAYS JUST ASSUMED THAT THOSE DRAWN TO BE A BUS DRIVER DESPISE PEOPLE THEY HAVE SOUGHT OUT AN IDEAL WAY TO HAVE PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON THEM AT THEIR MERCY WITH THE EXPOSURE TO PEOPLE SEEMINGLY SERVING TO JUST FEED THEIR ANGER CONTEMPT AND HATRED THUS IF THEY WERE NOT AS YOU SO ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED YOUR DRIVER THEY WOULD NOT BE BUS DRIVERS
IF I DON'T WANT TO THANK THE DRIVER I JUST SAY BIZZ QUICKLY INSTEAD OF CHEERS SOUNDS THE SAME
I'VE NEVER GOT THE THING ABOUT THANKING THE BUS DRIVER NOBODY THANKS ME JUST FOR DOING MY JOB
I'M SORRY BUT WHY IS NOBODY ADDRESSING THIS

YOU LIVE IN A HAT MUSEUM ARE YOU A HAT
DO YOU LIVE IN STOCKPORT
IT'S 2 MINUTES
ACCIDENTALLY TALKED DURING THE SILENCE TODAY WAS DISCUSSING A PROJECT WITH MY BOSS AND NEITHER OF US NOTICED THE TIME

I FEEL REALLY BAD ABOUT IT
WHOLE OF OFFICE COULD HEAR US SO WILL COME ACROSS AS REALLY DISRESPECTFUL




LIVE IN A HAT MUSEUM

DO THEY KNOW
I WAS IN A SHOP AT THE TIME AND SOME OLD TROUT WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE DELIVERY TIMES OF SOME BLINDS SHE WANTED TO BUY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE 2 MINUTES I TRIED A POLITE SAHH BUT SHE WAS FAR TOO EMBROILED IN DISCUSSION WITH THE POOR SALES ASSISTANT WHO I COULDN'T HELP BUT FEEL SORRY FOR
HAD A CUSTOMER COME ASK ME SOMETHING I WAS SO TORN BETWEEN HELPING THE GUY AND RESPECTING THE FALLEN
THEY LET ONE OFF IN MY TOWN AS WELL WHERE FROM IS UNCLEAR AND SEEN ANY BALLS GOING LOOSE JUST TO ADD TO THE IRONY OF THE CANNON OUR FIREWORKS ARE ALWAYS ON REMEMBRANCE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY INTERFERE WITH THE POSH SCHOOL WHO MUST ALWAYS HAVE A THING ON THE WEEKEND CLOSEST TO THE 5TH BANKERS
READY SALTED GOES BEST WITH LAGER JUST FYI
AT LEAST YOU HAD A CANNON OURS WAS DROWNED OUT BY FIRE ALARMS BECAUSE SOMEONE THOUGHT THE BEST WAY TO MARK THE START AND END OF THE SILENCE IS WITH A REALLY LOUD ANNOYING NOISE

BY THE TIME THE FIRST ALARM HAD STOPPED IT WAS ALMOST OVER AFTER WHICH THEY DID IT AGAIN
I WORK IN A HOSPITAL AND GOT A PHONE CALL AT THE START OF THE SILENCE IT WAS FROM A NURSE ON ONE OF THE WARDS WHO WAS PROBABLY SO BUSY SHE DIDN'T REALISE BUT I STILL FELT PRETTY MIFFED
I THINK THAT IF I WERE THE GHOST OF ONE OF THE UNFORTUNATE DEAD I'D THINK PEOPLE WERE TAKING THE PISS A BIT MARKING IT WITH A CANON PROBABLY ONE OF THE LAST THINGS I'D WANT TO HEAR
STYLE FAIRY LIQUID BOTTLES MADE THE BEST WATER SHOOTERS FOR WATER FIGHTS
NO IT'S GOOD WHEN KIDS WANT TO BE CREATIVE AND USE THEIR IMAGINATION RATHER THAN ONLY PLAY WITH TOYS
LUXURY WHEN I WAS A KID WE HAD TO MAKE DO WITH OLD RAZOR BLADES AND DEAD RATS NOT THAT THAT STOPPED US FROM HAVING FUN CHUCKING DEAD PLAGUE-RIDDEN RATS THROUGH OLD MRS BIGGINS KITCHEN WINDOW ETC ETC ETC
JUST DECANT THE FUCKING LIQUID AND GIVE HIM THE BOTTLE FFS
IT IS NOT EVEN ROCKET SHAPED
WHY DON'T THEY EMPTY THE SODDING BOTTLE WHEN IT WAS CLOSE TO THE END INTO ANOTHER ONE
YOU'D BUY ONE WHEN ITS LIKE TH LEFT SO YOU DON'T RUN OUT
THAT BRAT WAS CHANCING HIS ARM TO GET HIS FATHER TO SOME HOW GIVE HIM THE BOTTLE IF HE REALLY WANTED ONE HE COULD JUST LOOKED THROUGH OTHER PEOPLES RECYCLING

FUCK HIM AND HIS SPACESHIP
KIDS CAN'T MAKE ANYTHING OUT OF THE NEW SHAPED BOTTLES ANYWAY SO IT'S POINTLESS
I HOPE THEY GAVE HIM SOME PLASTIC TO HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER

SERIOUSLY THAT CONFUSED THE HELL OUT OF ME AS A KID TOOK ME AGES TO REALISE THEY MEANT SELLOTAPE
I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE IN OTHER THREADS BUT PLEASE REPORT THIS TO THE COMPANY YOU ORDERED FROM ALSO I WOULD DEFINITELY REPORT THIS TO YODEL AS WELL
IF YOU'VE GOT HIS MOBILE NUMBER THEN SIGN HIM UP FOR CAT FACTS
REMOVED
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO POST IT YOUR UNDERNAME MAKES THAT OBVIOUS
SCREW THESE OTHER GUYS THE QUALITY OF THE MUSIC AND THE MEMBERS ABILITY HASN'T CHANGED I DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT HE DID OBVIOUSLY BUT LISTENING TO THEM ISN'T EVEN CLOSE TO SUPPORTING THAT
SOUNDS LIKE A PERSONAL PROBLEM THAN A BRITISH ONE
DO YOU SUPPORT JIMMY SAVILLE AND GARY GLITTER AS WELL WHILST YOU'RE AT IT
MEGALOLZ
I DID THIS WITH A CLOTHES SHOP THE OTHER DAY I LOOKED AT ONE RIDICULOUS PRICE TAG AND WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE BEFORE I REALISED THE ONLY OTHER PEOPLE IN THERE THE STAFF WOULD REALISE I'M A TIGHT CUNT SO I HAD TO WANDER ROUND PRETENDING TO BE A PICKY CUNT INSTEAD TO SAVE FACE
OR WHEN YOU DONT HAVE THE RIGHT CHANGE YOU JUST WALK OUT ASHAMED OF YOURSELF THEN GET THE RIGHT CHANGE GO TO ANOTHER SHOP WHERE ITS MORE EXPENSIVE
DISPLAY AN TRAIN WHICH IS ON TIME THE TIME IS AND I'VE JUST PAID FOR MY TICKET YEP MY SMART CARD IS BROKEN 2 WEEKS INTO USING IT CHEERS LADS WALK DOWN THE STEPS TO THE PLATFORM AND MY TRAIN JUST LEFT AT AND THE NEXT TRAIN IS AT FANTASTIC SERVICE KEEP IT UP LADS
WELL IT'S SOUTHERN RAIL EVERYONE INCLUDING IT KNOWS IT'S BAD
YESTERDAY MORNING MY TRAIN WAS LATE AND THE TRAINS BEFORE AND AFTER WERE CANCELLED

SOUTHERN REPORTED A GOOD SERVICE ACROSS THE NETWORK
THAT'S A SIGN THAT YOU ARE A GOOD PERSON

I TIP MY HAT TO YOU
2 MINUTES
HOW MUCH ARE THEY THERE
I USED TO WORK IN A MORRIONS EVERY FUCKING YEAR YOU'D GET SOMEONE JUST CONTINUING THEIR SHOPPING AND TALKING WHILE IT WAS GOING ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO OBSERVE IT THEN FINE BUT DON'T BE A DICK AND DISRUPT IT FOR THOSE THAT DO
IT'S KIND OF SAD THAT THIS TRADITION SEEMS TO BE DYING
WHAT TRADITION IS DYING
WE WERE SITTING IN COLLEGE AND NONE OF US REMEMBERED DURING THE 2 MINUTE SILENCE WE PRESUME WE WERE LAUGHING AT A FELLOW COLLEGE MATE WHO HAD VOLUNTEERED TO BE SELLOTAPE TO HIS CHAIR AND PUSHED DOWN THE CORRIDOR

2 MINUTES

THIS IS THE THIRD POST SAYING A MINUTE SILENCE ITS MEANT TO BE 2 MINUTES SILENCE NOT MINUTE TWO MINUTES
SAME HERE I ONLY WOKE UP ABOUT AN HOUR AGO I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD RE-DO THE SILENCE AT MAYBE
ME TOO ALTHOUGH I WAS ASLEEP ON PURPOSE I'D LIKE TO THINK I WAS QUIET AND NOT SNORING
YOU WERE DON'T WORRY
TUTTING IN THE QUIET CARRIAGE IS BAD MANNER YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER
ALSO FOR PEOPLE WHO BRING BABIES VERY YOUNG CHILDREN INTO THE QUIET CARRIAGE
I'M AMERICAN AND WAS LIVING IN LONDON DURING THE ELECTION I HAD A VERY EARLY TRAIN AND WAS IN THE QUIET CARRIAGE SITTING AGITATED FOR SEVERAL HOURS BECAUSE THE ELECTION HADN'T BEEN CALLED YET WHEN I LEFT AND I COULDN'T CALL ANYONE WHILE ON THE TRAIN NORMALLY I LOVE THE QUIET CARRIAGE BUT IT WAS NOT IDEAL THAT MORNING
IT'S NOT A LIBRARY
I'VE FOUND THAT VIRGIN TWITTER TEAM IS A LOT BETTER AND DO SEEM TO KNOW THEIR STUFF I GOT ONTO THEM AND THEY INVITED ME TO A PRIVATE CHAT TO SORT OUT AN ACCOUNT PROBLEM BUT THEY SEEMED KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE TECH SIDE OF STUFF AS WELL
AT LEAST IT'S NOT PLUSHEST MATE
DATA PROTECTION ACT MY ARSE CAN'T BE ARCED ACT MORE LIKE
ONE OF MY FRIENDS GOT PUNCHED BY SOME GUY ON A NIGHT OUT THE POLICE THEN COLLARED SAID GUY AND ASKED MY MATE IF THIS WAS THE ONE WHO PUNCHED HIM DURING THIS TIME THE GUY IS IN TEARS DUE TO THE FACT HE'S BEEN ARRESTED SO MY FRIEND LETS HIM OFF THE HOOK SAYS IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE THE POLICE WALK OFF AND THEN THE GUY STARTS GIVE MY FRIEND SHIT AGAIN CALLS HIM A PUSSY AND WALKS OFFICIAL ALSO HAPPENED IN BIRMINGHAM COINCIDENTALLY
I FELL OFF MY BIKE ONCE TRYING TO HOP UP A KERB EVEN THOUGH I AM A GROWN WOMAN AND COULDN'T DO IT AS A KID LET ALONE NOW I GOT BACK UP WHEN I INEVITABLY CAME A CROPPER AND LOOKED ROUND TO CHECK NO ONE WAS WATCHING THEN WHEN I'D LIMPED IT ROUND THE CORNER I PHONED MY OTHER HALF AND CRIED AT HIM BECAUSE MY KNEE WAS SKINNED AND IT HURT
I FELL OFF MY BIKE A FEW MONTHS AGO I BROKE MY SHOULDER ELBOW AND WRIST AS I LAY THERE TANGLED UP IN MY BIKE A WHITE VAN SLOWED DOWN AND THE WINDOW ROLLED DOWN I THOUGHT THE GUYS WERE GOING TO ASK IF I WAS OK OR MAYBE EVEN HELP ME GET UP

WHAT I GOT WAS HA HA HA HA HA YOU WANKER AND THE VAN SPED OFFICIAL

CHEERS MATE
LOOKS THROUGH THREAD

HUH

SCRIBBLES NOTE TO SELF DON'T GO TO BRUMMIETOWN
OH DEAR I FELL OFF MY BIKE ONCE I COULDN'T STOP APOLOGISING POSSIBLY THE MOST EMBARRASSING THING I DID ALL YEAR
IF IT HELPS I HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE IN SOME ESTATE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF EDINBURGH

AND THEN SOME NED TEENAGE GIRL TRIED TO STEAL MY FRIENDS DOG OF ME LEAVING ME THE PROBLEM DO I STRIKE THEM OR NOT IF THEY DO MANAGE TO STEAL THE DOG OF ME

AND HOW PATHETIC MUST HAVE I LOOKED ON A COLD AND WINDY NIGHT IN THE LOWLANDS WRESTLING A GIRL OVER SCOTTISH TERRIER
I'VE HAD TO TURN IT OFF CHRIS ATTENTIVE INTENSITY WAS MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE
MICHAEL MCINTYRE WOULD PROBABLY GET VILIFIED BY TWITTER JUST FOR BEING ON TV
I BUMPED INTO A STEPLADDER LEANED UP AGAINST THE WALL AND TOLD IT TO FUCK OFF
I AM GOING TO MAKE IT MY MISSION IN LIFE TO NEVER ACTUALLY SEE THIS FUCKING ADVERTISEMENT IN SOME SMALL MEANINGLESS WAY I WILL HAVE BEATEN THE HYPE AND BULLSHIT
YEAH I SAID THIS ABOUT THAT THREE ADVERT WITH THE DANCING PONY TURNS OUT IT'S FUCKING REAL
THE DOG IS TRAINED
POINT OUT WHAT THAT THEY'RE CUTE GLEEFUL AND INNOCENT
BELENDVITAS ARE OK IF YOU DUNK THEM QUITE TASTY AND STURDY THEY ARE
MAKE A HOUSE OF CARDS OUT OF THEM
WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS BUYS SOME KIND OF WEIRD BISCUIT FOR THEIR BREAKFAST WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH SOME PEOPLE
WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR WHEN ITS SOMEONE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOMEONE IS COMPLAINING THAT IT'S TOO EARLY FOR CHRISTMAS ADVERTS
AS A PERSON WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND MOST INTERNET SHORTHAND IS THIS THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD META
IT'S CALLED LAMPSHADING AND IS USUALLY CONSIDERED A VERY LAZY TROPE IN NARRATIVES
ASKING IF IT'S TOO SOON TO BUY MINCE PIES THE PACK PROBABLY GOES OUT OF DATE BEFORE THE END OF NOVEMBER
JUST SEEN A YOUTUBE AD FOR BELL'S WHISKY FEATURING STEVEN TOAST USING THE SAME GIMMICK
IT ALSO FEATURES THE LINE TO BE FAIR HE DID BURN IT OFF TWEAKING
BUT IT'S NOVEMBER IT'S PRACTICALLY ALREADY CHRISTMAS
SHAUN YOU PLEBIAN
OUT OF THE M S JOHN LEWIS AND THIS THIS ONE ACTUALLY SEEMS TO REFERENCE THINGS THE SHOP SELLS LOVE IT
ODD LOOKS LIKE THE PICCADILLY STATION AND VICTORIA STATION ICONS ARE THE AFL ROUNDEL BUT THE OTHER STOPS ARE THE GENERIC TRAM ICON
WHY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE NICER THINGS FOR GUEST OR ROOMS WE NEVER GO IN PLATES THAT NEVER GET USED

IS IT OUR WAY OF SHOWING OUR LIVES ARE BETTER THAN THEY ARE OR USING NICER THINGS TO CELEBRATE WHEN SOMEONE COME ROUND
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT UNLESS YOUR NAME ISN'T ACTUALLY AIDAN
YOUR NAME IS MY NAME BACKWARDS ARE YOU AN EVIL VERSION OF ME
I THINK WITH MUGS THE GUEST SET IS TO STOP STRANGERS FROM USING YOUR MUG AS OPPOSED TO KEEPING THE FANCY ONES FOR BEST

IF I CATCH ANYONE USING MY MUG I GET VERY FUNNY ABOUT IT
I JUST HAVE THREE MUGS AND THEY ARE ALL MINE BECAUSE I'M MARRIED TO A HEATHEN AMERICAN WHO DOESN'T DRINK TEA OR COFFEE ODDLY ENOUGH ON THE RARE OCCASION OF GUESTS THEY ARE PERMITTED TO USE MY STRIPY MUG WHICH RANKS THIRD AND I ONLY USE IF I'VE FAILED TO WASH UP THE OTHER TWO IN A TIMELY MANNER NO ONE TOUCHES MY THE BRITISH EMPIRE RUNS ON TEA MUG ON PAIN OF DEATH
ROYAL DOULTON WITH THE PERIWINKLES
YOU KNOW YOU'RE OLD WHEN ARE
AH YES THE GUEST MUG HETP
HEY EVERYONE LOOK AT THIS GUY WITH ALL HIS FANCY GUESTS
WE HAVE NICE MUGS THAT WE NEVER USE AS THEY CAN'T GO IN THE DISHWASHER SEEMS THEY'RE PURELY ORNAMENTAL BECAUSE WE'RE LAZY FUCKS
MY DEARLY BELOVED MOTHER IS ABOUT A LOT OF HER CROCKERY AND CUTLERY IS WORN OUT CHIPPED OR I'VE BOUGHT HER NEW STUFF BUT IT'S A DICKENS OF A JOB TO STOP HER CATEGORISING IT AS FOR BEST I PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO HIDE THE OLD STUFF

NEXT UP A COMMANDO MISSION TO ABSTRACT AND REPLACE THE WASHING UP KIT
WORST OF ALL HIS NAME ISN'T AIDAN IT'S ROBERT
I'M AMERICAN AND HAVE OVER A DOZEN INDIVIDUAL HAND PAINTED VERY FINE TEA CUPS THAT MY FATHER APPARENTLY SENT HOME FROM ENGLAND DURING

I DON'T DRINK TEA AND AS FAR AS I KNOW NOBODY HAS EVER USED THEM FOR ANYTHING ALTHOUGH THEY'VE BEEN DUSTED EVERY YEAR SINCE

WHAT DO YOU GUYS USE THE FANCY CHINA TEACUPS FOR AM I MISSING OUT ON SOMETHING



NEXT TIME DRINK FROM ONE OF THE GUEST MUGS ON PURPOSE THEN GO TAKE A HUGE SHIT IN THE GUEST BATHROOM JUST TO SHOW YOURSELF YOU'RE THE BOSS IN YOUR OWN HOUSE JUST MAKE SURE THE WIFE IS NOT AT HOME FIRST
OH AIDAN THERE'S THAT IMPERIALIST THOUGHT PATTERN AGAIN YOU ARE WORTH THE POSH CUP USE IT MY MAN USE IT
THIRTIES IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE YOU'LL BE IN YOUR FIFTIES TRUST ME I KNOW

I WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M W T F
THE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AIDAN

INVITE YOURSELF FOR TEA
HUH OVER AND I'M STILL USING THE PLAIN WHITE IKEA CUPS I BOUGHT WHEN I MOVED I HAVE ONE BIG MUG THOUGH FOR WHEN I'M DOING DIY AND WANT A BREW
WHEN WE MOVED INTO A NEW PLACE WITHOUT A DISHWASHER WE JUST KEPT OUR FANCY PLATES AND MUGS ON DISPLAY AND USED PAPER PLATES AND PLASTIC FORKS FOR A YEAR JUST SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DIRTY THEM BECAUSE FUCK HAND WASHING
MY WIFE AND I HAVE A GORGEOUS DENBY TEA SET THAT WE HAVE NEVER USED BECAUSE IT'S FOR WHEN WE HAVE A COTTAGE AND A SET OF DENBY MUGS THAT ARE FOR USE NOW BUT WE NEVER ACTUALLY USE THEM IN CASE THEY GET DAMAGED

IT'S ALL VERY SAD
I KEEP THE POSH CUPS FOR MYSELF GUESTS ARE CLUMSY GUESTS BREAK THINGS
SAVE FOR BEST
WHEN YOU ANSWER THE PHONE IN UNDERWEAR DOES YOUR WIFE SCOLD YOU FOR TALKING ON THE PHONE WHILE YOU'RE DRESSED LIKE THAT
I READ MIND AS MAID AND WAS MILDLY CONFUSED
USE THE CRYSTAL GLASSES USE THE GOOD PLATES YOU MIGHT BE DEAD NEXT WEEK ENJOY THE GOOD THINGS NOW
I ACTUALLY FOUND MY PARENT'S WEDDING CUTLERY IN MY DAD'S WARDROBE I CLEANED OUT AFTER THEY DIED I'D NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE AND I WAS AT THE TIME IT'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THINGS LIKE THAT ARE KEPT FOR BEST THEY JUST FEEL TOO SENTIMENTAL AND PRETTY TO USE FOR CUTTING UP YOUR DAILY MEALS
YOU DAFT ANETH
SEE I'M THE OPPOSITE STILL MY F AND I HOARD THE FANCY THINGS SO OUR FRIENDS DON'T BREAK THEM USUALLY WHEN THEY COME ROUND IT'S FOR A PARTY
YOU THINK IN THIRD PERSON THAT'S PRETTY WIERD
AIDAN PLS
THIS MORNING I THOUGHT YA KNOW PEPPERMINT TEA AND PLAIN YOGURT WITH GRANOLA SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT BREAKFAST
ONE DAY YOU'LL REALISE YOU'RE SO OLD YOU'LL CHANGE FROM AIDEN TO ALAN AND YOU'LL START MOANING AT THE TV WHEN YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THE ROOM
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING TO YOURSELF WHY ARE YOU REFERRING TO YOURSELF BY YOUR OWN NAME IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE YOU SPEAK TO USING JUST YOUR MIND MUTANT HE'S A MUTANT
I THINK YOU SHOULD WONDER WHY THERE'S A GUY NAMED AIDAN IN YOUR HOUSE DRINKING ALL YOUR TEA
I'M FAIRLY SOON BUT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE PAST YEARS
WHEN YOU ARE YOU REACH FOR A COFFEE CUP AND THING WHY DID THAT HURT MY BACK OH YEA I TURNED FUNNY YESTERDAY
WHAT IS A POSH COFFEE CUP LOOK LIKE
I THINK PEOPLE ARE MISUNDERSTANDING WHY PEOPLE HAVE NICE THINGS FOR GUESTS

IT'S NOT TO SHOW THAT YOUR LIFE IS SO GOOD THAT YOU HAVE TO USE THAT SHIT ALL THE TIME IT'S TO SHOW YOU THAT THE GUEST IS SO SPECIAL THAT IT'S WORTH IT TO USE THAT EXPENSIVE SHIT WITH THEM
HALACHA I TOLD MY HUSBAND OFF LAST WEEK FOR MESSILY LEAVING WET TOWELS ON THE LIVING ROOM RADIATOR TRUE IS WAS A SUNDAY NIGHT AND ABOUT BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE HAD SEEN THEM
AH THOSE SPORTS DIRECT MUGS I KEEP THEM FOR VISITORS TOO
YOU MEAN THE SLIGHTLY DUSTY CADBURYS CREME EGG MUG AT THE BACK
YOU CAN AFFORD FANCY CUPS FOR GUESTS DECADENT B DS
WTF IT'S AN OLD CELTIC NAME
WTF IT'S AN OLD CELTIC NAME
OK I WAS WORRIED ABOUT BEING OLD AT BUT IM REALLY CLUELESS ABOUT THIS REFERENCE
WHAT A FAG
OH MANUAL PLUS YOUR NAME IS AIDEN LIFE IS BRUTAL
AIDAN YANK CUNT NAME GTO THIS SUB REDDIN FILTHY SEPPA
SURELY BROKEN RAILS ARE NETWORK FAULT NOT GREATER
CAN NEVER BE TOO CAREFUL
IF I'D KNOWN I'D HAVE BOUGHT HER A FREE GIFT A CHARMING CARRIAGE CLOCK OR A PARKER PEN
HAPPENSTANCE MISFORTUNE
2 COINCIDENCE CARELESSNESS
ENEMY ACTION BOOJUM
TO BE HONEST THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN QUITE ABSENT IN OUR AREA TOO NOT SURE IF IT WAS A LACK OF VOLUNTEERS OR A DELIBERATE WISH TO HAVE FOR SOME REASON I COULD NOT POSSIBLY FATHOM A SUBDUED AND LOW KEY APPROACH THIS YEAR


I HAVEN'T EITHER
I SAW ABOUT FOUR INCLUDING JUST THE CARD BOXES ON A TILL IN SHEFFIELD

IN LIVERPOOL THEY WERE EVERYWHERE ABSOLUTELY EVERY STREET HAD AT LEAST ONE ON THE TRAIN STATIONS EVERYWHERE
DIDN'T SEE ANY SELLERS THIS YEAR BOUGHT MINE FROM A PUB THEY WERE ALSO AT THE TILLS FOR THE CANTEEN AT WORK
THIS MORNING I SAW A POPPY PIN ON MY DESK SO I PUT IT ON MY JACKET I GET HOME FROM WORK AND MY GIRLFRIEND WAS TOTALLY LOOKING FOR THE PIN THIS MORNING

I DIDN'T HAVE TO DONATE THIS YEAR
THE OFFER HAS BEEN GETTING CUT BACK FOR A WHILE

WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IT WAS MONTHLY THE DROPPED TO QUARTERLY NOW IT'S GONE COMPLETELY

IS MY OWN FAULT THOUGH I HAVE LOST MY JOHN LEWIS CARD
THE DRIVER REPLIES MANY TIMES BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL A LITTLE WOUNDED IF HE DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE MY CHEERS WITH A CHEERS OF HIS OWN EVEN IF IT'S AT THE BUS STATION AND A PROPER RESPONSE FROM THE DRIVER INVOLVES RESPONDING THIRTY TIMES
THE LAST BUS I WENT ON THE DRIVER DROVE LIKE A BLOODY MANIAC HAVEN'T BEEN THAT SCARED FOR AGES MADE MY DISPLEASURE LOUDLY APPARENT BY NOT SAYING CHEERS AS I GOT OFFICIAL
AS A BUS DRIVER CHEERS
IF YOU DON'T SAY CHEERS TO THE DRIVER YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF WITHHOLDING A THANK YOU WHEN THEY DO A SHIT JOB LETTING THE GUY UP FRONT SAY THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE RUINS YOUR GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO PASSIVE AGGRESSIVENESS
I DONT SAY THANKS BUT I DO GIVE BUS DRIVERS A MEAL SOMETIMES
THE ALTERNATIVE IS A CONTINUOUS LINE OF SCREW YOUS

I THINK I'LL STICK WITH THE GRATITUDE THANKS
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER IT WAS ANNOYING HOW THEY MADE HER THE OFFICIAL SINGER OF LONDON BUT HER MUSIC ITSELF IS REALLY NICE AND SOULFUL AND SHE SEEMS LIKE A DECENT LASS HERSELF
IT DEPRESSES ME THAT I KNOW WHO THIS IS THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT ALTHOUGH WE'LL NO DOUBT HEAR THE SINGLE WITH HORRIFIC REGULARITY OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY SAID ALBUM
OH YOU'RE OFF TO MY OLD TOWN HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR VISIT AND MAY THE SEAGULLS BE MERCIFUL

WHEN WE BOOKED A FAMILY HOLIDAY TO GLASGOW IT PRINTED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL TICKETS COUPONS THE GUARD ON THE VIRGIN TRAIN JUST GAVE UP CHECKING OUR TICKETS HALFWAY THROUGH
BARBERS SHOPS ARE CLOSING IN MY AREA IF IT ISN'T AN ESTATE AGENT COFFEE SHOP OR CHARITY SHOP THEN IT IS A HIPSTER STYLE BARBERS OPENING UP
MY PREFERRED BARBER STILL HAS OLD COPIES OF LOADED AND A BIG POSTER OF HOLLY VALANCE
PLENTY OF NEW BARBERS HERE FILLED WITH BEARDED SLEEVE TATTOOED LUMBERJACKS NO COPIES OF THE SUN PLUS I THOUGHT THE ONLY HAIRCUT AVAILABLE AT BARBERS OF OLD WAS A SHORT BACK AND SIDES THESE HAVE A BLOODY MENU
WHEN THIS HAPPENS TO ME I ALSO FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO WAVE THANKS AS I STEP INTO THE ROAD AND AGAIN AS I'M PASSING THE CAR GETTING OUT OF THEIR WAY

AND I'M TERRIFIED OF MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH THE PERSON GOD FORBID I EVER DID I'D PROBABLY TRIP OVER AND THEY'D JUST HAVE TO ROLL OVER ME
THE QUALITY OF THE STANDARD PAPER POPPY HAS DECREASED I AM SURE WHEN I WAS A KID IT TOOK REAL EFFORT TO DETACH THE BLACK BIT FROM THE GREEN STEM THESE DAYS YOU JUST NEED TO GIVE IT A FUNNY LOOK AND IT POPS RIGHT OFFICIAL
THERE IS A NEWLY BUILT FIRE STATION OUT SIDE THE COLLEGE I USE TO ATTEND ONCE SAW A FIRE ENGINE STRUGGLE TO GET PAST THE RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC IN THE MORNING WHICH THEN HAD TO GOT THROUGH A ROUND ABOUT THAT WAS ALWAYS GRIDLOCKED
THAT'S WHY FIRE ENGINES HAVE BLUE LIGHTS ALSO EVERYWHERE IN THE UK EXPERIENCES A BIT OF HEAVY TRAFFIC ANYWAY AROUND THE RUSH HOURS WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN SCHOOL RUNS EACH DAY AND TWO HOURS OF RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC EACH DAY
SIM CITY I BELIEVE
PEOPLE WERE A WEEK EARLY AS WELL AT LEAST THEY'RE CONSISTENT
SAME THING WAS HAPPENING TO ME EARLIER THE OTHER HALF COMMENTED ABOUT THE BAD TASTE OF SETTING EXPLOSIONS OFF ON REMEMBRANCE DAY

I JUST HID UNDER THE BED WITH THE CATS UNTIL THEY STOPPED
MAYBE THEY'RE WEEKS EARLY
SOME PEOPLE SET THEM OFF FOR REMEMBRANCE DAY THEY REPRESENT BOMBS SHELLS BUT ARE NOW MADE PRETTY SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE A WEIRD WAY OF REMEMBERING THOSE LOST
CLEARLY YOU DON'T REALISE WE ARE NOW IN FIREWORKS MONTH WITH A BRIEF FEW WEEKS OFF BEFORE THE NEW YEAR FIREWORKS COMMENCE FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS
MY AUNT DID THIS AT MY HOUSE THE SILLY COW

I SPENT A WEEK STAYING WITH MY GRAN AND THE WHOLE TIME I WAS THERE I WAS WONDERING WHY THE TEA TASTED LIKE PARMA VIOLETS
SOMEONE AT WORK REFILLED THE PG TIPS BOX WITH A MEDLEY OF IT IS LIKE A TEA ADVENT CALENDAR ONLY FILLED WITH RAISINS AND CLOVES
SACRILEGE THE TEA GODS WRATH TM WILL STRIKE THEM DOWN
MUST BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE
IT'S FINE BOTH ARE SHIT COMPARED TO MY ULTRA HIGH QUALITY UNIVERSITY OFF BRAND ASDA SEABAGS YOU CNO WHAT JUST KILL M NOW
I THINK THE LAW SAYS THIS IS THE ONLY CRIME FOR WHICH THE DEATH PENALTY CAN BE GIVEN

HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE TO SPARE FOR CANCER RESEARCH

ALRIGHT LOVE BUT I DON'T THINK WE'LL GET MUCH DONE
HI MATE HOW ARE YOU HAVING AN AWESOME DAY LOVE THE JUMPER YOU'RE WEARING CAN YOU SPARE A FEW MINUTES YOU AWESOME PERSON OH FINE THEN YOU DON'T CARE
I STRATEGICALLY PLACE MYSELF BEHIND SOMEONE ELSE AND LET THEM TAKE THE FALL WHILE I SLIP PAST I KNOW IT'S LOW BUT WHEN YOU WORK IN HILBORN AND THE PLACE IS CRAWLING WITH THE FUCKERS YOU HAVE TO EMPLOY THESE TACTICS OR YOU'LL JUST GO ON A CHUGGER BEATING RAMPAGE
ARITE MATE GOT A TENNER FOR THE DISABLED WHASSAT TOO GOOD FOR THE DISABLED IS THAT IT ARITE THEN MATE FUCK OFF

I FUCKING HATE CHUGGERS
COULD THE SOUNDTRACK CONSIST OF SOMEONE SHOUTING THE BIG ISSUE
JUST WALKED THROUGH MY OWN TOWN CENTRE AND THE BASTARDS HAVE ONLY GONE AND FORMED A WALL OF DEATH ACROSS IT
ROUND TWO AVOIDING PEOPLE PUSHING BUGGIES NOT CARING ABOUT THE KIDS THEREIN

ROUND THREE AVOIDING CYCLISTS ON FOOTPATHS

ROUND FOUR NEVER STEPPING OUTSIDE EVER AGAIN BECAUSE BOOK THAT I NEED A CUPPA
I LOVE IT WHEN THEY COME UP TO ME IT ALWAYS CARRS THEM WHEN SAYING FIRMLY NO AND LOOKING THEM IN EYES
CHHHHHAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNGEEEE
I'VE MASTERED THE ART OF AVOIDING GETTING WAYLAID BY CHUGGERS I LOOK THEM IN THE FACE AND GO NOOOOOO I'M ALLRIIIIIGHT THAAAAAAAANNNNKKS LOUDLY OVER THEIR SPIEL WHILST NEVER BREAKING MY STRIDE WORKS EVERY TIME
LEVEL 2 WOULD BE OUTSIDE CAMDEN TUBE STATION AT APPROXIMATELY PM ON A WEEKDAY

ADD IN SLOW-MOVING TOURISTS AND FAST-MOVING WORKERS SOME OF EACH LOOKING AT PHONES


IT WOULD BE LIKE FROGGER OR THAT OLD CHICKEN CROSSING GAME ONLY INCREDIBLY TRAUMATIC TO BOOT
I ALWAYS TELL THEM STRAIGHT OFF THAT I'LL SIGN A PETITION DEPENDING ON WHAT THE PETITION IS OF COURSE OR MAYBE GIVE THEM SPARE CHANGE BUT THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL I'M GIVING MY CARD DETAILS TO RANDOM PERSON WITH A CLIPBOARD ON THE STREET
THEY'VE STARTED PITCHING UP DIRECTLY OUTSIDE MY OFFICE BASTARDS
IN MY CITY MOST CHARITY WORKERS AREN'T ACTUALLY CHARITY WORKERS
I JUST FLAT OUT SAY NO AND KEEP WALKING THEY CAN'T PHYSICALLY RESTRAIN YOU AND I COULDN'T CARE LESS IF THEY THINK I'M HEARTLESS FOR IT
I INSIST I'M SKINT WHICH I AM FOR ONCE IT'S CONVENIENT
AZO
STEPS OUT OF BIRMINGHAM NEW STREET STATION


BIG ISSUE BIG ISSUE


PLEASE DONATE FOR HELP THE


WOULD YOU LIKE A GYM MEMBER SHIP MATE


CHANGE FOR THE DISABLED


SPARE A MINUET FOR CANCER


THEY ARE LIKE A SWAM OF LOCUSTS IF THEY EVEN SEE YOU ENGAGE WITH ONE OF THESE PEOPLE
I'VE GOT TO THE POINT NOW WHERE I JUST HOLD MY INDEX FINGER UP AND WAGGLE IT LIKE I'M TELLING A CHEEKY KID NOT TO DO SOMETHING USUALLY WORKS
I HAD ONE WALK UP TO ME AND TRY TO STOP IN FRONT OF ME TO GET ME TO STOP NOPE WALKED STRAIGHT INTO THE DENSE GIT AND CARRIED ON GOING
I HAVE TWO TRICKS FOR AVOIDING THEM THE FIRST ONE IS THE CLASSIC GET MY PHONE OUT MY POCKET AND LOOK LIKE SOMEONE HAS JUST TRIED TO CALL ME

THE SECOND IS TO TACTICALLY PLAN MY WALK WAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO GET SUCKERED IN AND THEN MAKE A BEELINE WHILE THE WORKER ISN'T LOOKING IT'S KIND OF LIKE PLAYING METAL GEAR SOLID IN REAL LIFE
OXFORD ST DECEMBER


FUCK NUMBER THAT'D BE SOME GTA SHIT
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO DANCE
TRYING NOT TO TRIP OVER THE HOMELESS PEOPLE AT THE SIDE OF THE STREETS
DELETED
MY TWO RULES ARE NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM A DOOR SALES PERSON AND NEVER GIVE OUT ANY DETAILS ON THE STREET IF I CAN DO IT BUY POPPING SOME CHANGE IN A BOX AND I HAVE SPARE CHANGE OKAY SURE BUT ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES ME TO TALK TO SOMEONE I WILL MOSTLY GO I WILL LOOK IT UP ONLINE AND MAKE A DECISION IF THEY ARE ACTUALLY DOING IT FOR A CHARITY THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM IF IT'S COMMISSION BASED OR SCAM THEN THEY WOULD PROBABLY TRY TO CONVINCE ME BUT IF ALL ELSE FAILS GENERALLY TRY TO PLAN A PATH TO AVOID THEM OR TRAP SOMEONE ELSE IF I CAN

I DON'T SIGN PETITIONS OUTSIDE EITHER NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF NEWSLETTER OR OTHER THEY WILL SIGN YOU UP FOR AS YOU USUALLY HAVE TO PROVIDE ADDRESS OR EMAIL OR BOTH OR PHONE NUMBER
IF YOUR VR CHARACTER WAS ASIAN I GUARANTEE IT'D BE LIKE AN INVISIBILITY CLOAK
THE SEMI ATTRACTIVE FEMALE ONES ARE THE WORST BUT WITH THEM I TURN THE PERVERT DIAL ALL THE WAY UP AND SEE THEIR MINDS CHANGE
SOMEONE HOLD ME

I'M PEEING MYSELF HERE
NOT A HAUNTED HOUSE LIKE IN BLACK MIRROR
I PAID FOR A BADGE THAT STAYS ON MY WATER COAT NOW EVERY TIME J PASS SOMEONE COLLECTING FOR POPPY'S I JUST CHUCK OR IN THEIR BUCKET
THEY ARE ON THE FLOOR OF THE BUS AND TRAIN STATION AS FAR AS I'VE SEEN
I BOUGHT A BRACELET FROM THEM WITH A POPPY TOKEN ON MUCH BETTER THAN STABBING MYSELF WITH THOSE BLOODY PINS
HEART RADIO HAD A TWO MINUTES SILENCE WHICH WAS THE ONLY TIME THEY WEREN'T PLAYING ONE OF THEIR FIVE SONGS REPEATEDLY
WHY IS THIS BLASTED THING NOT WORKING AGAIN
IT SHOULD BE QUITE WE HAVE THE RADIO ON AT WORK AND THERE WAS SOMEWHAT RADIO SILENCE WITH ONLY SOUND SCAPE SOUNDS
OOOO THAT IS BRAVERY
WHENEVER I GET ONE OF THESE CALLS I ANSWER IN THE STYLE OF A PIRATE WHALER
THEM OUR RECORDS SHOW YOU'VE HAD A CAR ACCIDENT RECENT
ME ARR BUT TWAS NOT A CAR TWAS ME BOAT I WAS SAILING ROUND THE ISLAND OF NANTUCKET WHEN A GREAT WHALE STRUCK THE STARBOARD SIDE

THEY HANG UP EVENTUALLY

THIS TECHNIQUE ALSO WORKS FOR PPI

THEM OUR RECORDS SHOW YOU WERE MIS SOLD PPI
ME ARR BUT TWAS NOT PPI I WAS MIS SOLD TWAS A BOAT I WAS SAILING ROUND THE ISLAND OF NANTUCKET WHEN I NOTICED THE TIMBERS WERE CRAWLING WITH WOODWORM AND SO WAS ME WOODEN LEG






IT IS GETTING BEYOND A JOKE NOW

VERY ANNOYING THE FACT THAT A CALL CAME FROM SOUTH AFRICA USED TO MAKE IT EASY NOW THIS

I HAD A BLOODY PPI ONE FROM A MOBILE NUMBER THE OTHER DAY

THINK YOURSELF LUCKY YOU AREN'T A SALESMAN LIKE MYSELF I HAVE TO ANSWER EVERY CALL ON THE WORK MOBILE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS IT'S GETTING VERY ANNOYING
I KEEP GETTING THEM FROM THE AREA CODE I USED TO LIVE IN THAT AND MANCHESTER FOR SOME REASON
MY VOICEMAIL HAS THE RECORDING OF A MODEM IF I DON'T LIKE OR RECOGNISE THE NUMBER I'LL LET THE VOICEMAIL GET IT
OH DEAR WHY IS THIS A THING MY ONLY RULE ATM IS ONLY ANSWERING NUMBERS THAT ARE LOCAL OR SAVED AS PRIVATE CALLER OR OUT OF AREA NEVER IS A GOOD ONE I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO LET THEM LEAVE A MESSAGE AT THIS RATE AS EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF TIMES WHERE THEIR SYSTEM IS STUPID AND THEY LEAVE A LONG REPEATING MESSAGE OF TO HEAR BLAH PRESS NO SALES PERSON OR AUTO DIALLER SEEMS TO LEAVE A MESSAGE
I'VE HAD THAT TODAY TOO FIRST TIME SEEING IT REALLY ANNOYING CAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY EXPECTING AN IMPORTANT PHONE CALL TODAY SO THEY KEPT GETTING ME
IF ANYONE SO MUCH AS TOUCHES MY FAVOURITE MUG THERE IS HELL TO PAY NO ONE ELSE IS ALLOWED TO DRINK FROM IT
PUTTING ON MY FAIR HAT WERE THERE PLENTY OF OTHER CUPS AVAILABLE THE BRITISHPROBLEMARIAT NEEDS TO KNOW WHETHER YOUR FLATMATE WAS GUILTY OF MALICE OR MERELY HEEDLESSNESS ANYWAY I THINK SHE WOULD PROBABLY BENEFIT FROM A REFRESHER COURSE IN DOMESTIC RULES AND REGULATIONS
DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW MUCH A BOOK OF FIRST CLASS STAMPS COST THESE DAYS SHUT UP AND BE GRATEFUL
YOU NOW CAN SEND FREE COMPLAINT LETTERS
ID BE ON THE PHONE TELLING THEM WHERE TO SHOVE THEIR STAMPS
NOT A SINGLE MOBILE PHONE FIRM THAT I KNOW OF USES ROYAL MAIL THEIR FIXED PRICES MADE THEM UNCOMPETITIVE WHEN IT CAME TO INSURED SPECIAL DELIVERIES WHICH RAISES THE QUESTIONS

WHO SENT YOU THE PHONE AND ARE THEY REPUTABLE

2 SINCE ALL YOU GOT WERE STAMPS WHY WASN'T IT SPECIAL DELIVERY WHICH COMES WITH INSURANCE

WAS IT EVEN DAMAGED YOU DON'T SAY

WHY ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT COMPENSATION YOU'RE EITHER ENTITLED TO NONE OR REQUIRE NONE
UNLESS IT WAS DELIVERED WITH ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT INCLUDES INSURANCE YOU'RE LUCKY TO GET ANYTHING
I'D COMPLAIN TO THE SELLER RETAILER WHATEVER IT IS THEM WHO HAD THE CONTRACT WITH ROYAL MAIL NOT YOU AND IT IS THEM WHO ARE LEGALLY OBLIGED TO SORT IT OUT UNDER THE CONSUMER RIGHTS ACT
COMPLAIN MORE THATS YOUR ONLY OPTION BESIDES ACCEPTING DEFEAT WHICH IS SOMETHING I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND
WHAT'S THE COMPANY HAVE YOU LOOKED UP THE ADDRESS TO SEE IF IT'S A ONE OFF ERROR OR AN ERROR UNIQUE TO THE COMPANY
A US ADDRESS
NOPE IT'S AN ERROR ON THE COMPANIES PART AS THE ADDRESS IS IN FELTHAM
WAS IT

OH FFS


ED BALLS

YOU BETTER NOW SHIT SHIT SHIT

WERE YOU DELIBERATELY TRYING TO MAKE US THINK YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT TRUMP
R BRITISHSUCCESS

YOUR DAD WENT TO BUY YOU MILK SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT A CUP OF TEA
YOUR DAD IS THE SORT OF PERSON WHO PUTS THE GREAT INTO BRITAIN I SALUTE HIM AND I SALUTE THE SUPERIOR GENES YOU HAVE INHERITED U VARIO FOR WORLD PRESIDENT
WISEMAN
YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR HIM HE GAVE YOU LIFE YOU COULD AT LEAST HAVE GOT HIM MILK
MILK UNFORTUNATELY IS THE ONE INGREDIENT YOU CAN'T BACK UP IN AN EMERGENCY STASH TYPE THING I KEEP A ZIPLOCK OF SEABAGS AND SOME SUGAR SACHETS SWIPED FROM COSTA FOR EMERGENCIES ONE AT WORK ONE IN DRAWER AT HOME POWDERED MILK JUST DOESN'T CUT IT I'M AFRAID IT'S AN INSULT TO THE TEA

YOUR DAD IS THE HERO HERE
OMGOMGOMG

I RECENTLY REALISED YOU CAN FREEZE MILK

YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL DEFROSTING IT YOU CAN'T DEFROST IT IN THE MICROWAVE AS SOME PARTS OF IT START TO COOK STANDING IT IN A BOWL OF HOT WATER IS BEST IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY IF NOT JUST LEAVE IT ON THE COUNTER SHAKE WELL BEFORE USE

SO I JUST POUR SOME FRESH MILK INTO A LITTLE MINI BOTTLE AND FREEZE IT SO AT LEAST IF I RUN OUT I CAN STILL HAVE 2 OR CUPS OF TEA BEFORE I HAVE TO GO TO THE SHOP

YOUR DAD IS A HERO THOUGH I WOULD DEFINITELY DO THE SAME IN THAT SITUATION
IS THIS THE ENGLISH EQUIVALENT OF THE DAD GOING UP TO THE SHOW TO GET CIGARETTES AND NEVER RETURNING OR DID HE HAPPILY COME BACK
BRITAIN DOESN'T NEED TO BE MADE GREAT AGAIN IT HAS BEEN IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE BECAUSE OF THE HEROIC ACTIONS OF THE FEW
THIS IS WHY I HAVE AN EMERGENCY CARTON OF LONG LIFE WHOLE MILK

NOT GREAT MILK BUT BETTER THAN SKIMMED OR NOTHING
YOUR DAD WOKE UP EARLY ENOUGH TO SAVE YOU ALL FROM A TEALESS MORNING THAT'S R BRITISHSUCCESS
YOU JUST DRINK IT BLACK IF YOU THINK IT TASTES HORRIBLE THEN TRY SPENDING MORE THAN A COUPLE OF PENCE PER SEABAG RATHER THAN BUYING ULTRA ECONOMY BAG PACKS ETC BUY TEAS FROM A SPECIFIC REGION
AND THEY SAY THE ECONOMY IS IN TROUBLE WHEN THIS GUYS THROWING AROUND EXTRA S LIKE THERE GOING OUT OF FASHION
NEITHER ARE THEY SHARED
I VISITED MY DAD RECENTLY HE IS HAVING HIS ROOF DONE AND ASKED THE ROOFER IF HE'D LIKE A BREW MAKING OBVIOUSLY THE ROOFER SAID YES AND THEN WENT UP HIS SCAFFOLDING TO TAKE SOME MEASUREMENTS MY DAD MADE HIM HIS DRINK AND THEN SHOUTED HIM THAT IT WAS READY

THE SILENCE WAS UNBEARABLE AS ME AND MY DAD SAT THERE WAITING WATCHING THE COFFEE GET COLDER AND COLDER ONLY TO BE DISGUSTED BY HIM RETURNING MINUTES LATER AND SIPPING HIS LUKEWARM WARM DRINK LIKE IT WAS FRESH THE KETTLE
REALLY THE KEY IS TO PREPARE YOU BATHROOM WITH A SLIGHTLY OPEN WINDOW GIVING THE MENTAL NOTE OF THAT CAN BE OPENED MORE WITHOUT BEING RUDE AND A FRAGRANCE SPRAY VISIBLE WHEN SITTING
THE CLEAR SOLUTION IS TO INSIST ON JOINING HIM IN THE TOILET SILENTLY GAZING AT HIM AND JUDGING
IF THEY'RE BACK TOMORROW HIDE THE LOO ROLL

OR FAILING THAT TAKE OUT YOUR PLY CUSHIONED ALOE VERA INFUSED BUM SHEETS AND REPLACE IT WITH THE COARSEST CHEAPEST AND THINNEST LOO ROLL THAT MONEY CAN BUY
BUILDER SHITS ARE EQUIVALENT TO CHEMICAL WARFARE I WAS CONSIDERING PHONING THE GENEVA CONVENTION WHEN I WAS HAVING MY EXTENSION DONE
GREGGS SHITS ARE THE WORST
I SWEAR IT'S ALL THOSE FULL ENGLISH BREAKFASTS THEY EAT
THEY DONE IT ON PURPOSE I MEAN I WOULD
PLUMBERS I COULD UNDERSTAND HAVING TO MAKE SURE IT'S WORKING CORRECTLY
DAMN LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT TOILET BUCKED
YOU MUST BE NEW MONEY THEN
PUT IT ON EBAY
SELL IT ON FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE
I STILL HAVE NOT TOUCHED A NEW FIVE POUND NOTE I THINK I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THE COUNTRY
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LITERAL ANSWER THE BBC NEWSROOM IS BELOW GROUND LEVEL AND IT'S HARD TO SEE OUTSIDE FROM THERE
IT'S WINTER THERE IS NO SUN
THEM NOT HAVING WINDOWS MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM THEY COULD BE USING APPLE
LORD MAYOR'S SHOW IN RAIN ALMOST EVERY YEAR DO THEY NOT REALISE
I WON'T EVEN ANSWER THE PHONE IF I'VE GOT A TEA ON THE GO
YOU NEED ONE OF THOSE PHONES WHICH CAN INITIATE A FAKE CALL IF YOU SURREPTITIOUSLY TAP ONE OF ITS BUTTONS FOUR TIMES WHILE IT'S IN YOUR POCKET
I RECENTLY HAD A SUPERIOR STOP ME ABOUT SOMETHING HE FELT WAS IMPORTANT JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO IN THE TOILET FOR A POO I WAS STOOD RIGHT OUTSIDE THE TOILET WITH MY HAND ON THE DOOR THE WHOLE TIME AND AS I TYPE THIS I'M STARTING TO SUSPECT HE KNEW AND WAS JUST FUCKING WITH ME FOR HIS OWN AMUSEMENT
I LOL AT THIS LOL
IT WAS BETTER THAN LAST YEARS BUT NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ONE THREE YEARS AGO
OOH ME ME I DID THAT ACTUALLY I THINK WAS THE BEST THEY'VE EVER DONE AND I'D GENUINELY BE HAPPY TO SEE THEM USE IT NEXT YEAR
THAT'S MY MATE MUMS DOG I RANG HIM THIS MORNING TO TELL HIM HIS MUMS DOG WAS TRENDING ON TWITTER AND TO TAKE THE PISS THAT HIS MUMS DOG HAS ACHIEVED MORE IN HIS LIFE THAN HIM
THE ALDI PARODY WAS BETTER THAN LAST YEAR'S
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE GIVE A SHIT ABOUT AN ADVERT MAKES ME WEEP FOR HUMANITY
EVEN THE COMMENTS WERE BETTER LAST YEAR
IT WASN'T AS GOOD AS LAST YEAR'S
I'M JUST GLAD THEY DIDN'T USE A RASPY VOICED PIANO COVER OF A POPSONG
DIDN'T EVEN LIKE LAST YEARS PULLS AT THE STRINGS TOO MUCH

IT'S NOT ADVERTISING THEN IT'S EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL
I DUNNO YOU NOT SEEN ROBOCOP
IT IS A RECAPITULATION OF ALL CRITIQUE A SHAMELESS ODE TO THE BANAL AND TRUNDLING MEDIOCRITY OF MODERN BRITISH OFFICE LIFE AND ITS SALVATION BY A STUPID DRINK

BOYCOTTED AND BLOCKED

IN THE BIBLE PSALMS DEATH IS COMING
IT'S NOT QUITE PROFESSOR ELEMENTAL IS IT

WATCH V EEL
I ALWAYS FIND MYSELF SAYING BLESS YOU WHEN THE DOG SNEEZES

IT'S JUST COMMON COURTESY MATE
IS THIS A BRITISH PROBLEM OR DOWNRIGHT HUMAN CIVILITY JUST BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A SECOND SOUL NEARBY DOES NOT EXCUSE RUDENESS EXCUSE YOU INDEED
I CAME OUT THE GYM THE OTHER MORNING AND POPPED IN TO TESCO TO GET MILK FOR WORK

THEY WERE STACKING THE SEASONAL STUFF AND LISTENING TO CHRISTMAS SMOGS I FOUND IT ENJOYABLE UNTIL I WAS AT WORK HUMMING SLADE AND THEN GETTING RIDICULED
WORK IN RETAIL YOU GET TO HEAR THEM END OF OCTOBER ALL THE WAY THROUGH
UNLESS IT'S THE POGIES IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS UNTIL I'VE HEARD FAIRYTALE OF NEW YORK UNPROMPTED ON A LIVE BROADCAST
WHEN YOU'RE IN SCHOOL YOU'RE TOLD NOT TO TAKE SWEETS FROM STRANGERS THEN YOU GET TO UNI AND PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO GIVE YOU FREE FOOD

THE QUICKEST WAY TO POISON A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE WOULD BE TO GIVE AWAY POISONED PIZZA ON A UNI CAMPUS
I THOUGHT THEY DO FREE SAMPLES OF DRUGS
YES DO AVOID OR YOU'LL FEEL YOU HAVE TO THEN BUY THE FULL VERSION OF SAID FREE SAMPLES HAPPENED TO ME YESTERDAY I TASTED 2 SAMPLES OF 2 DIFFERENT CHILLI SAUCES AT THE GLASGOW CHRISTMAS MARKET AND FELT I HAD TO THEN BUY THE ONE I LIKED UNFORTUNATELY I NEVER HAD CASH ON ME AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO ADVERTISE THEY TOOK CARD SO I SHAMEFULLY WALKED OFFICIAL
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT BRANCHING OUT INTO BADGERS
ALL I CAN THINK OF IS THIS

WATCH V
THE MAIN PROBLEM I SEE WITH IT IS THAT THE FOXES AND BADGERS COULD NOT LOOK MORE CGI IF THEY WERE BIG GREEN AND VOICED BY MIKE MYERS

IT REALLY LOOKS PRETTY RUBBISH
BUY A NEW TRAMPOLINE FOR YOUR DOG NO DON'T BUY FROM THERE BUY IT FROM US
I'M ALREADY ANNOYED BY THIS BECAUSE THE OFFICE LOUD-MOUTH DECIDED TO SHOW EVERYONE WHO CAME IN I REFUSED ON FULL BLAST AT HER COMPUTER

HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND I REFUSE TO DO SO

I DO SHOP AT JOHN LEWIS THOUGH
I DON'T THINK JOHN LEWIS ARE AIMING AT COUNCIL ESTATES
THEY'VE JUST RESURFACED THE BYPASS AROUND MY TOWN NO DOUBT IN PREPARATION FOR TOUR DE YORKSHIRE NEXT YEAR AND RATHER THAN PLANE THE WHOLE ROAD AND PUT A NEW SURFACE ON IT THEY'VE DONE ROAD WIDE STRIPS AT RANDOM SPACINGS RESULTING IN A JOURNEY THAT WAS WORSE THAN BEFORE THEY'D STARTED WHAT IS WORSE IS THEY'VE TAKEN FAR LONGER TO DO IT THAN IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN TO RESURFACE THE WHOLE ROAD
I CAN'T WAIT FOR A DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS WHEN I GONNA HAVE TO PUT OFF ALL THE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS AND REPLACE THEM WITH EASTER ONES LUV TO WORK IN RETAIL
CHECK THE PACKAGING THERE'S PROBABLY A SMALL CAMERA IN THERE INSTEAD WITH THE RED LIGHT GLOWING
I FEEL FOR YOU MATE
HAVING TO SHOP AT SPORTS DIRECT YOU DON'T WANT TO BUT EVERYWHERE ELSE HAS A WORSE SELECTION AND IS MORE EXPENSIVE
SPORT DIRECT IS A DICKENSIAN WORKHOUSE
YOU HAVE TO OPT IN FOR I THINK WHEN YOU PLACE THE ORDER
BREVIT AND TRUMP THAT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR YOU
IT'S ALREADY APPROACHING AT RAMMING SPEED
WELL UK ONCE OWNED AMERICA SO
FORTUNATELY THE MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE MEANS THE HAPPENING
THE POPPY IS SUCH A BIZARRE THING IT'S SIMULTANEOUSLY A HEARTFELT COMMEMORATION OF THE DEAD AND YET ALSO A SYMBOL OF BRITISH NATIONALISM AND A WEIRDLY COMMERCIALISED CHARITY IT WAS ORIGINALLY STARTED BY AMERICANS BUT IS NOW FAR MORE COMMON IN THE UK AND SEEN AS TRADITIONALLY BRITISH IT STANDS FOR UPHOLDING LIBERTY AND FREEDOM BUT YOU'RE CRITICISED FOR NOT WEARING ONE UP TO AND INCLUDING DEATH THREATS FOR CERTAIN CELEBRITIES IT'S ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED AND CONFUSED SYMBOLS I CAN THINK OF
THE DEATH OF THOUSANDS

THERE WERE JUST OVER A MILLION BRITISH MILITARY CASUALTIES IN AND WW2 COMBINED
WIKI

THE MASCOT SOUNDS FUCKING STUPID
DID CLIFF RICHARD KNIT IT
WHAT WAS IT A GIANT POPPY
OH WE'VE HAD THAT THING FOR YEARS

THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO ONE IS AROUND ENGLAND AND THE OTHER IS AT THE SOMME WAR GRAVES
I KNOW THE FEELING SOMEONE DROPPED A PROTEIN SHAKE IN MY GYM AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO SHOUT WHEY
THEY WERE PROBABLY IN STUNNED SILENCE THAT YOU SHOUTED WHEELY AT YOUR OWN PLATE TUMBLING TO THE GROUND
COOL WELL PLAYED THEY WERE WRONG YOU WERE RIGHT
A GIRL AT MY WORK DROPPED A COUPLE GLASSES AND I CLAPPED SHE CRIED AND I NEARLY GOT A DISCIPLINARY FOR BULLYING

THANKS OBAMA
I WAS IN A PUB THAT HAD A LIVE BAND PLAYING A DRUNK WOMAN WAS DANCING LIKE A CRAZY PERSON AND IT WAS OBVIOUS SHE WAS GOING TO HIT THE DECK AT SOME POINT WHEN SHE FINALLY LOST HER BALANCE AND CRASHED INTO THE BAND I BURST OUT LAUGHING THE ROOM WAS COMPLETELY SILENT OTHER THAN THE SOUND OF MY LAUGHTER A GUY ACTUALLY SCORNED ME BECAUSE IT'S NOT FUNNY HOW IS A DANCING DRUNK WOMAN FALLING NOT FUNNY
I KNOW THE FEELING

WAITRESS IN SPOONS DROPPED A GLASS THE OTHER DAY AND MY CRIES OF SACK THE JUGGLER WERE MET WITH BLANK STARES BROKEN BRITAIN I TELL YOU
MY TYPICAL RESPONSE IS TO SHOUT SACK THE JUGGLER
WAS IN THE PUB THE OTHER NIGHT IT WAS PACKED AND EVERYONE WAS PRETTY SOZZLED BY THIS POINT

ONE OF THE WAITRESSES DROPPED A PILE OF PLATES THE USUAL SHOUTS OF WHEELY AND SOME APPLAUSE BEGAN BEFORE GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER UNTIL PEOPLE BEGAN STANDING UP TO GIVE HER A STANDING OVATION

WE HAVE OUR PROBLEMS BUT I DO LOVE THIS COUNTRY
PERHAPS YOU MISSED THE TELEGRAM BUT I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T DOING THAT ANYMORE
SHOULD SHOUTED CURDS
OOOOOOOOOH GET YOU IN YOUR CANTEEN WHY AREN'T YOU EATING COLD BAKED BEANS OUT OF THE TIN
IT'S ALL FAULT
AT THAT POINT YOU MAY AS WELL GO THE WHOLE HOG AND SING TO THE TUNE OF GO WEST PET SHOP BOYS YOU'RE SHIT AND YOU KNOW YOU ARE
ODD THAT HAPPENED AT OURS YESTERDAY US STUDENTS LOOKED AROUND AWKWARDLY BUT THE OTHER CANTEEN STAFF WERE CHEERING AND CHEVYING VERY ODD
I'M SORRY FOR BEING AMERICAN BUT WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE BE KIND ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU'D SHOUT WHEY IS IT SOME SORT OF RHYMING SLANG
BUT WHAT IF THEY HAD A MILK ALLERGY
MAYBE EVERYONE ELSE MARRIED TO MY WIFE AND KNEW THEY'D GET TOLD OFF
AT LEAST IT SEEMS TO BE A BRITISH EXPRESSION UNLIKE MOST OF THE OTHERS WHICH ARE FROM THE US VIA THE INTERNET
I AM STILL TRYING TO COME UP WITH AN AMUSING REPLY TO THAT QUESTION MY COLLEAGUES USE IT ALL THE TIME
I USE THAT PHRASE IF I WANT THEM TO COME TO MY DESK OR FOR HELP WITH MANUAL HANDLING TASKS

THAT WAY THEY'RE COMMITTED TO THE TASK AND YOU CAN WALK AND TALK THE ISSUE AT HAND
WHY CAN'T THE DRIVER JUST DRIVE OFF FUCK HER AND HER MINTS
SUBMITTED AN HOUR AGO

IS SHE BACK YET

OOH THEY'VE GOT EXTRA STRONG SHALL I PUSH THE BOAT OUT AND GET THOSE INSTEAD OF MY USUAL POLOS I CAN'T DECIDE OH LET'S GO FOR IT HOW MUCH IS THAT JUST A MINUTE I'VE GOT THE RIGHT MONEY HERE HOLD ON YOUNG LADY I KNOW I'VE GOT ANOTHER TUPPENCE IN HERE SOMEWHERE
THE BUS DRIVER HAS A GOOD HEART FOR GOING AGAINST HIS CONVENIENCE IN HELPING AN OLD LADY BUT THE OLD LADY IS A RIGHT OLD BAG THOUGH FOR EVEN CONDESCENDING TO ASK SUCH A REQUEST
I HAVE THIS VISION OF A LEAD ATTACHED TO THE BUS TRAILING INTO THE SHOP WHERE IT IS GRASPED TIGHTLY BY A LITTLE OLD LADY
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST DO THE NORMAL
YEP NO POBS I WILL WAIT
AS SOON AS SHE STEPS OFF BUS DRIVE AWAY CLAIM TO MANAGEMENT YOU MISS HEARD OF SHE COMPLAINS
IF SOMEONE YOUNG WANTED TO DO THAT SHE'D BE FIRST TO COMPLAIN YOUNGER GENERATION RESPECT SELFISHNESS AND SO FORTH
THAT'S OK AS LONG AS SHE BUYS ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE CLASS
OH
HONESTLY YOU COULD HAVE PROBABLY ENDED THE TITLE AT INSURANCE COMPANIES
IT'S VERY PROFITABLE MOST PEOPLE THINK THEY GOT A DECENT DEAL AND WILL JUST LET IT ROLL OVER WITHOUT CHECKING

IT'S FAIRLY COMMON TO GO ON THE COMPARISON SITES AND SEE YOUR EXISTING INSURANCE COMPANY QUOTE FOR CONSIDERABLY LESS THEN WHEN YOU POINT THIS OUT THEY SAY IT'S A NEW CUSTOMER ONLY DEAL AND ARE SURPRISED WHEN YOU BECOME AN EX CUSTOMER INSTEAD
MY INSURANCE COMPANY WOULDN'T TRANSFER MY YEARS NO CLAIMS DUE TO IT BEING A VAN TO CAR INSURANCE THEY WAS STILL THE CHEAPEST OPTION WITH NO NO CLAIMS THEY THEN SENT ME A CERTIFICATE STATING YEARS NO CLAIMS NOTHING MENTIONING VAN IN THE TITLE
THE PROBLEM IS IF EVERYONE WAS A BIT MORE SAVVY AND KEPT GETTING A BETTER DEAL THEN THOSE OF US WHO DO BOTHER TO LOOK AROUND WOULD END UP PAYING MORE SO I'M ALL FOR EXPENSIVE AS A PUNISHMENT FOR LAZINESS
WEEKLY ENJOY THAT WHILST IT LASTS
WEEKLY COLLECTION IN BRITIAN TELL ALL
WEEKLY LUCKY BASTARD
THIS IS A TRUE BRITISH PROBLEM I KEEP MY BINS OUT THE FRONT NOW IT MAY LOOK A HIT SCRAPPY BUT AT LEAST THEY GET EMPTIED
HOW ABOUT REPLACING THE SOLICITORS WITH FROGS LAST ONE I SAW WAS AS THICK AS PIG SHIT AND CHARGED AN HOUR OR PART THEREOF
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO TELL THEM YOU'RE GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE
IN FAIRNESS THE STUDENT PROBABLY ISN'T BUYING 2 MINUTE AD SLOTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE X FACTOR WHICH TAKE A PRETTY BIG CHUNK OF YOUR BUDGET
LINK TO SAID STUDENTS VIDEO

I AGREE THOUGH COMPLETELY UNDERWHELMING THAT VIDEO COMPARED TO THE EXCELLENT ADVERTS WE'VE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO

EDIT ISN'T THAT GREAT EITHER
THAT STUDENT'S AD IS NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD SORRY IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE OR INVOKE ANY EMOTION
IT STARTED WITH PROMISE BUT WHEN THE CGI ANIMALS OF FARTHING WOOD ALL GOT DOWN TO PARTY I THREW UP A BIT IN MY MOUTH WOULD IT HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH TO USE REAL FOOTAGE OF FOXES OR BUSTER PROBABLY NOT SCREW YOU JOHN LEWIS SCREW YOU
AAH IT'S TIME FOR THE OLD REDDIN SMUG HATE THE JOHN LEWIS ADVERT SOON BE OH GOD WE HATE THE M S ONE TOO
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT THEREFORE IT HAS DONE ITS JOB
I SAW THIS LITERALLY JUST NOW WHO BUYS THEIR KID A TRAMPOLINE FOR CHRISTMAS SURELY IT'S A SUMMER THING
QUITE LIKE IT NOT AS SCHMALTZY AS PREVIOUS ONES
ACTUALLY THINK IT'S GOOD BUT YET AGAIN ANY GOOFY LOOKING DOG CAN GET ME GRINNING
MY CRITERIA FOR POTENTIAL WORK AND OR HOME LOCATIONS IS RAIL STATION PROXIMITY I WILL GO TO CONSIDERABLE LENGTHS TO AVOID BUSES
FIRST BUSSES ARE A DISGRACE THE ONE I GET INTO AND OUT OF NORWICH IS CONSISTENTLY LATE SOMETIMES I'M WAITING FOR IT AND I'M STOOD THERE UNTIL THE NEXT ONE TURNS UP THE SCREEN SAYS EXPECTED HH MM UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY JUST DISAPPEARS AS IF IT HAS COME AND GONE

THEN THE DRIVER FUCKS OFF LEAVING THE BUS UNATTENDED WITH PASSENGERS INSIDE HAVING TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT DRIVER TO START THEIR SHIFT

THIS DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN ONCE OR EVERY NOW AND THEN IT'S EVERY SINGLE TIME I'VE GOT THIS BUS SOMETIMES IT'S QUICKER FOR ME TO WALK HOME
FIRST BUS MADE ME GET A CB AND A MOTORBIKE IT'S CHEAPER THAN A CAR WELL YES OK THE BIKE ITSELF IS MORE EXPENSIVE UPFRONT BUT A CB IS DONE IN A DAY TAX IS FOR THE YEAR AND I PUT WORTH OF PETROL EVERY DAYS OR SO PLUS IT'S GREAT FUN TO RIDE AND THERE'S NO SMELLY LOUD OBNOXIOUS PEOPLE PLAYING THEIR HITE MUSIC ON THEIR HITE PHONES
ATLEAST YOU GET FREE WIFI ON THE BUS
MOVE TO A CITY
LEARN TO DRIVE IF YOU CAN I KNOW IT IS EXPENSIVE BUSES ARE GOOD WHEN IT ISNT OR BUT THEY FALL TO SHIT AT PEAK TIME

JUST SEEN YOUR EDIT THE ONLY OTHER THING YOU CAN DO ESPECIALLY KNOWING THE BUSES ARE POOP IS LEAVING EARLIER
GET A MOPED
LET'S MAKE AMSTRAD GREAT AGAIN
PRIME MINISTER SUGAR WILL SEE YOU NOW
R
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS ARE EVERY BIT AS LEGITIMATE A CANDIDATE FOR PARTY LEADER AS MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT HE'S ALREADY POISED TO STRIKE
HE OWNS THE BUILDING MY IN

I JUST WANT HIM TO MAKE MY STAIRS GREAT AGAIN
AS A MEMBER OF HOUSE OF LORDS HE ALREADY HAS SOME EXPERIENCE
HE'S NOT UNHINGED
DO WE HAVE TO MAKE HIM ORANGE TOO
WHILE THIS IS TERRIBLE NEWS FOR AMERICA IT'LL MAKE FOR A FUN FOUR YEARS OF NEWS HEADLINES POTUS GRABS MERKEL BY THE PUSSY TO DISPLAY DOMINANCE IS NOW A HEADLINE THAT IS WITHIN THE REALMS OF POSSIBILITY
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T BE UPSET ABOUT THIS
ALREADY GOT POLITICAL EXPERIENCE THIS SITUATION IS MORE AKIN TO PETER JONES TRYING TO MAKE BRITAIN GREAT AGAIN
WHAT'S WORSE GEORGE GALLOWAY WAS RIGHT

GEORGEGALLOWAY STATUS
NAH NOT ENOUGH OF A DICKHEAD REGARDLESS OF THE TV SHOW

SIR PHILLIP GREEN ON THE OTHER HAND
ALAN SUGAR WOULD BE A LOT BETTER HIS VERSION OF THE APPRENTICE ISN'T HIM MASTURBATING FOR A HOUR OVER HOW GOOD HE IS AT BUSINESS
WITH THE TWITTER SPAT HE HAD WITH TRUMP I'D SAY HE'S MORE CONCERNED ABOUT A CRUISE MISSILE HITTING HIS HOUSE THAN RUNNING FOR ANYTHING
BUT HE ACTUALLY WAS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN HE DIDN'T INHERIT WEALTH
THE BLOODY APPRENTICE
THAT'S LORD SUGAR TO YOU
OR MAYBE RICHARD BRANSON

SOME OF THE LABOUR CENTRISTS MIGHT FEEL LIKE THEY CAN WORK WITH HIM HE DONATED TO LABOUR FOR YEARS HE IS BY NO MEANS AN ALT RIGHT NUT JOB LIKE TRUMP IS
HE'S ALREADY SAID HE WOULDN'T GO FOR IT

SORRY TO BURST BUBBLE

SAID IT TO GREG JAMES ON RADIO A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WHEN THE APPRENTICE FIRST STARTED
NAH PIERS MORGAN WOULD BE OUR TRUMP SUGAR WOULD POSSIBLY DO A HALF DECENT JOB
I'D VOTE FOR HIM
CAMPAIGN SLOGAN HEY IF TRUMP CAN DO IT
NO WAY SUGAR WOULD FINISH ABOVE IF AN ARSENAL SUPPORTER RUNS AGAINST HIM PM PIERS MORGAN PERHAPS
ONLY IF CLAUDE COULD GET SOME KIND OF POSITION IMAGINE HIM AS FOREIGN SECRETARY
WELL AT LEAST WITH ALAN HE STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM TRUMP STARTED FROM THE TOP OF THE TOP
IF I HAD TO CHOSE BETWEEN HIM AND MAY I PROBABLY WOULD CHOSE HIM
FUCK IT BRING IT ON ONCE YOU START BREAKING THINGS YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO FULL ROCKSTAFF AND WRECK THE ENTIRE HOTEL ROOM
I'D VOTE FOR HIM OVER WHAT WE HAVE NOW TSH
MAKE ENGLAND PROPER GOOD AGAIN
AMSTRAD MAILERS FOR ALL
HE INSISTED ON RADIO THAT HE HAD ZERO INTEREST IN BECOMING PM
YOU GUYS WILLING TO TAKE A FEW OF US YANKS
IT ONLY TOOK THERESA MAY VOTES TO BECOME AN MP AND THEN BE PM VIA LEADERSHIP ELECTION
AT LEAST HE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A RACIST AND XENOPHOBIC PERSON WHO BELIEVES THAT FILLING UP THE ENGLISH CHANNEL WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO STOP IMMIGRANTS FROM COMING TO THE UK

ALSO WOULDN'T HE ALSO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE IN POLITICS HE IS A LORD ANYWAY
NOT A HUGE FAN BUT HE'S NO TRUMP
R IS READY
I THINK JEREMY CLARKSON WOULD BE A GOOD ANALOGUE
YOU KNOW AS TERRIBLE AS IT SOUNDS HE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE BETTER THAN MAY AND HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE A HITE SIGHT BETTER THAN TRUMP AT LEAST HE ACTUALLY IS GOOD AT BUSINESS
OUR TRUMP IS BERNIE ECCLESTONE
FIRST HE NEEDS TO MAKE AMSTRAD GREAT OR RELEVANT FOR THAT MATTER AGAIN
GOOD HE'D BE BETTER THAN THERESA MAY
HAHA MY GIRLFRIEND AND I MADE THIS JOKE LAST NIGHT TRUMP BECOMING PRESIDENT IS LIKE ALAN SUGAR RUNNING FOR PRIME MINISTER LITERALLY EXACT WORDS
THAT'S SIR PRIME MINISTER TO YOU
I'D VOTE FOR HIM HE'S NO TRUMP DEFINITELY A CONSERVATIVE
CAN'T WE HAVE RICHARD BRANSON INSTEAD
HE WOULD BE A GREAT PM BETTER THAN OLD SOUR PUSS
COULD BE WORSE COULD BE BRANSON HE'S GOT A GOOD PUBLIC IMAGE BUT MY BROTHER KNOWS HIM BUFF SED
AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS HE CAN'T RUN FOR A SEAT IN THE COMMONS
LORD SUGAR TO YOU YOU FUCKING PLEB
THEN AGAIN OUR SYSTEM DOESN'T REALLY LET OUTSIDERS COME IN AND RULE THAT QUICKLY EVEN THOUGH KIP GOT WHAT THEY WANTED THEY NEVER REALLY GOT ANYWHERE
WHY
WE'D BE ALL FIRED
LORD NOT SIR SH
I WOULD NOT MIND

THIS COUNTRY USED TO BE GREAT WE USED TO USE AMSTRAD AND THE WORLD WAS ENVIOUS IT IS TIME TO RESTORE OUR PRIDE AND GREAT BRITAIN MAKE AGAIN
AT LEAST HE HAS POLITICAL EXPERIENCE AND I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S NOT A RACIST
JESUS I JUST SAW THE IMAGE OF THE NEW TOBLERONE WTF IS THAT MESS IS THAT A DELIBERATE FUCK YOU BECAUSE THATS THE MOST CHOCOLATE DEVOID TOBLERONE I'VE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE
I FEEL HE WOULD BE A BETTER LEADER THAN TRUMP WILL BE THOUGH
HE SAID NUMBER

STATUS

I'M HEARTBROKEN
DEL BOY FOR PM THEN RODNEY FOR DEPUTY PLANKER
KATY HOPKINS AS DEPUTY



NOOKIE BEAR FOR PAGE M

GET BACK TO THE AAAAAAAAUSE
SURELY WE AREN'T THAT STUPID ARE WE
GOOD IDEA IF YOU ASK ME WOULD BE BETTER THAN WHO'S THE PRIME MINISTER
HE'S PART OF LABOUR THOUGH AND ACTUALLY REASONABLE COMPARED TO TRUMP
PRETTY SURE IT'S LORD ALAN SUGAR NOW ISN'T IT
THE POPE WILL DECLARE A HOLY WAR AGAINST LORD SUGAR IF THAT HAPPENS
LORDS PEERS CAN'T STAND IN ELECTIONS SO NO WORRIES
THE GUY STARTED FROM NOTHING YOU GOTTA RESPECT THAT WHICH I DO
DON'T WORRY KHARTIK HAS ALREADY SORTED THAT ONE
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE OF THIS REFERENDUM
OR RICHARD BRANSON

PHILIP GREEN ANYONE
OR ARAGE IN YEARS FUCK THAT
DOPEY LORD SUGAR
HE HAS A SWEET NAME
I'D VOTE FOR HIM OVER THERESA MAY
IF TRUMP GETS HIS SHOWS BACK HE WILL BE REFERRED TO AS PRESIDENT TRUMP I THINK THAT HAS A BETTER EFFECT THAN THAN YES LORD SUGAR THEY'LL ALL BE SAYING YES MR PRESIDENT
HERE FROM ACROSS POND AGAIN TO SAY THAT I'M MORE SCARED OF NIGEL ARAGE FUCK THAT GUY IN ALL DIMENSIONS
IF THIS HAPPENS I'M EMIGRATING
FUCK

ESPECIALLY SINCE LABOUR WILL PROBABLY KEEP HAVING NEW LEADERSHIP CONTESTS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS UNTIL THEY'VE FINALLY GOT RID OF CORBAN
JUST THINK IF HE WAS THE PRIME MINISTER HE MIGHT FINALLY GET RID OF PIERS MORGAN FOR US
I SEE YOUR LOGIC I MEAN TRUMP DONE IT IN THE US
WE ALREADY HAVE ONE THAT NOBODY VOTED FOR SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
I REMEMBER ONLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HE WAS CONSTANTLY ARGUING WITH TRUMP ON TWITTER SO THAT WOULD BE FUNNY
HILLARY AND TRUMP BOUNCING TOGETHER

AND EVERY BOUNCE ACCOMPANIED BY THE SOUND OF ANCIENT BONES SNAPPING
WELL I IMAGINE RIK WALLER WOULD BE GLAD OF THE WORK
REQUEST GRANTED


I SAW THAT ADVERT FOR THE FIRST TIME JUST NOW WHILE WATCHING THE AVENGERS WHO COULD DISLIKE IT

R BRITISHPROBLEMS COMMENTS
I GAVE UP ON WHEN IT HIT ME ONE DAY THAT THEY ARE JUST A COMPLICATED WAY TO DRINK A CUP OF HOT WATER THEY DON'T TASTE LIKE SOUP AND THEY ARE NOT NUTRITIONALLY ANYTHING LIKE SOUP SO THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE IN COMMON WITH SOUP IS THAT THEY HAVE SOUP IN THEIR NAMES
ARE YOU PERFORMING THE CARDINAL ROOKIE ERROR OF DUMPING THE SACHET IN THE MUG THEN ADDING HOT WATER OR ARE YOU DOING THE PROPER ADD SACHET THEN ADD A SMALL AMOUNT OF HOT WATER TO MAKE A PASTE BEFORE TOPPING UP WITH MORE WATER METHOD
USE TWO MUGS
IKEA MUGS MADE IN THAILAND ONES CIRCA S NO GOOD
THE SLUDGE IS THE BEST BIT
I THINK THEY MUST HAVE CLONES OF HIM IN A BASEMENT SOMEWHERE THAT THEY DUST OFF AND USE AS AND WHEN ITS NEEDED COVERAGE ON ELECTION NIGHTS FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE A SPARE JOLLY LOOKING ONE FOR EGGHEADS TOO

OR HE'S CGI NOW THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE STAMINA AND UBIQUITOUSNESS
THE OTHER HALF IS CLAIRE BALDING WHEN SHE'S NOT ON CHANNEL THAT IS
BUT HE'S SO NATURAL AT FILMING THOSE INCREDIBLE GREEN SCREEN MOMENTS HOW COULD THE BBC EVER FIND ANYONE EVEN CLOSE TO HIS TALENTS
I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR MICROWAVE DRINKS
YOU'RE REALLY BLAMING FOR NOT LEAVING YOUR HOT FOOD TO COOL FOR A FEW MINUTES
WELL THEY DO TELL YOU TO LEAVE IT TO COOL I'M GUESSING YOU DON'T HAVE MANY MICROWAVE MEALS IN THAT CASE COUNT YOURSELF LUCKY
SAINTSBURY ONLY TAKE A FEW MINUTES CO OP ONES SEEM TO TAKE TWICE AS LONG AND YOU CAN'T EVEN PICK THEM UP FROM THE MICROWAVE AFTER
THEY SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR EXISTENCE

END OF DAYS MATE
THAMESLINK WAS RAMMED AND PEOPLE WERE TALKING EVERYWHERE IF I COULD HAVE MOVED I WOULD HAVE CRAWLED INTO THE PARTITIONS BETWEEN SEATS TO ESCAPE THE MADNESS

FACEBOOK IS FREAKING OUT IT'S LIKE BREVIT ALL OVER AGAIN BUT I FIND MYSELF THINKING WHO CARES I'M BRITISH NOT AMERICAN WHY DO I CARE IF TRUMP IS PRESIDENT CHANCES ARE IT WILL NEVER EVEN AFFECT ME

LET'S SAY IT DOES IN WHAT WAY COULD IT POSSIBLY AFFECT MY SIMPLE LIFE THE ECONOMY GETS MESSED UP WELL I DOUBT IT WILL IMPACT ANYTHING ANY WORSE THAN BREVIT DID HELL IT HAS LOWERED THE PRICE OF THE DOLLAR SO ALREADY DONE US A FAVOUR

LUCKILY MOST OF THE BUSES I WENT ON WERE ONES WHERE YOU HAVE TO GET OFF THE DOOR BY THE DRIVER SO I WOULD OFTEN NOT BOTHER PRESSING IT AND JUST GET UP AND STAND BY THE DOOR SO IT WAS OBVIOUS I WANTED TO GET OFFICIAL
I RANG THE BELL BEFORE THE LAST STOP YESTERDAY

I WAS THE ONLY ONE ON THE BUS AND THE DRIVER STOPPED THE BUS BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD INSTEAD OF DRIVING THE EXTRA METRES AND SAID OH SO YOU WANT TO GET OFF HERE INSTEAD OF THE STATION

IT WAS CLOSER TO MY HOUSE BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO LIVE THAT ONE DOWN AND I COULDN'T HANDLE THE SHAME OF SAYING SORRY AND LETTING HIM FINISH THE ROUTE I WISH HE JUST DROVE THOSE METERS AWAY FROM MY HOUSE AND SAID NOTHING
I ONCE PRESSED THE BUTTON FOR THE HANDICAP AREA BY ACCIDENT AS I GRABBED THE RAILING AND IT WAS LIKE A FUCKING SIREN GOING OFFICIAL THE BUS STOPPED AND I JUST SAT THERE PRETENDING NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
THIS HAPPENS TO ME EXCEPT I REALISE IT'S TOO LATE TO RING THE BELL FOR MY STOP WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE AN IDIOT SO I WALK THE EXTRA MINS
WHO NEEDS A BUS STOP

THERES RED AND GREEN BUTTONS ON THE EXIT DOOR UNDER THE FLAP

LEAVE AS YOU PLEASE
MY BUS STOP IS CONCEALED BY ANOTHER SIGN AND SOME TREES SO THE DRIVER KNOWS ITS THERE BUT THEY AREN'T SURE WHERE

SO THEY ALWAYS MAKE AN ABRUPT STOP JUST AFTER IM ALWAYS THROWN INTO THAT WALK RUN AS I LEAVE TERROR
ON THE PRACTICE DISC I GOT I STARTED TO REALISE THEY USED THE SAME COUPLE OF CARS AS THE ONES WHO WOULD DO SOMETHING WRONG SO I WOULD JUST LOOK FOR THE GREEN VW GOLF AND WAIT FOR IT TO DO SOMETHING STUPID
GLAD I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT THOUGH HAZARDS ARE QUITE EASY TO SPOT THERE ARE VERY FEW CHARGERS WITH CONFEDERATE FLAGS ON THE ROOF
YOU'VE GOT SOME SHIT PROGRAM FOR IT AND OR YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE BEHIND THE TIMES LIKE CORNWALL

IN THE TEST CENTRE IT'S ALL NEW FANCY CGI VIDEOS
ALSO THE DUMB SYSTEM WHERE THEY ONLY RECORD THE TIME AND NUMBER OF CLICKS I NEARLY FAILED MY HAZARD PERCEPTION BECAUSE I CLICKED TOO MANY TIMES
I'M SO GLAD THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THE HAZARD PERCEPTION TEST WHERE I LIVE WHEN I STARTED DRIVING LESSONS IN THE UK I RESEARCHED THE TEST BUT THEN FORTUNATELY MOVED BACK HOME PHEW
SOMEHOW FOR ALL OF MY THEORY I DID THE HAZARD PERCE EVERY TIME

MY CENTRE HAD THESE NICE MONITORS BUT THE HAZARD PERCE WAS STILL HITE
I THINK THIS NEEDS AN ELI
THAT'S BECAUSE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS SAY HE MIGHT BEGIN OPERATING IN GORILLA WARFARE ON U SOUTH SOIL
GOOD IDEAS THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM
OR A SAND SNAKE AMBUSH ON AMERICAS SOIL
DID THEY ALSO ANNOUNCE THAT DEDUCTIVE REASONING AND LISTENING COMPREHENSION IS ON THE DECLINE
AH YES THE APPARENT NEW LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD
BUT WE VOTE IN A POLITICAL PARTY
THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS
I'M TO APOSTROPHE KEY

DUDE THIS IS A GRANDAD FACEBOOK TIER CHAIN COMMENT I LEFT FACEBOOK TO GET AWAY FROM THIS SHIT
HAVE TOAST INSTEAD BRITISH SOLUTION
MAKE A CUP OF TEA OR COFFEE
2 DIP BLADE OF BUTTER KNIFE INTO HOT BEVERAGE FOR A FEW SECONDS
USE WARM KNIFE TO HELP SPREAD THE BUTTER
THAT IS WHY GOD INVENTED MICROWAVES NOT SO PEOPLE CAN COOK DELICIOUS PEAS AND SWEETCORN WHILST RETAINING NUTRIENTS BUT TO SOFTEN BUTTER DO NOT OVERDO IT THOUGH OR HIS WRATH WILL TURN SAID BUTTER TO LIQUID
MY BUTTER WAS TOO COLD A MONTH AGO
I'VE FOUND IN TRYING TIMES SUCH AS THESE THAT IF YOU GRATE THE BUTTER MUCH LIKE YOU WOULD WITH A BLOCK OF CHEESE IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO SPREAD
LACERATED BREAD IS NO FUN
WHERE DO YOU KEEP YOUR BUTTER OUTSIDE
PUT A KNOB OF BUTTER ON A SAUCER RINSE A GLASS IN REALLY REALLY HOT WATER DRY VERY QUICKLY THEN PUT GLASS OVER KNOB OF BUTTER THE RESIDUAL HEAT FROM THE GLASS SOFTENS THE BUTTER
MY MISSUS GOT ME ONE OF THESE IT REALLY JUST GIVES ME COLD HANDS I'M TOO IMPATIENT TO LET IT WARM UP
I LIKE KEEP MY BUTTER SUPER COLD ALWAYS HAVE

THE TRICK IS TO LIKE SCRAPE THE BUTTER IN LOTS AND LOTS OF THIN STROKES DON'T JUST CARVE A PIECE OUT YOU NEED TO LIKE SHAVE THE TOP LAYER UNTIL YOU HAVE THE REQUIRED AMOUNT ON YOUR KNIFE THEN IT ALWAYS SPREADS FINE
BUT WHY DON'T YOU USE SPRAY BUTTER IN A CAN

SAYS THE AMERICAN

SHUDDER
OLIVE SPREAD NEVER GOES HARD JUST LIKE MY AORTA
PRAYERS AND THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU
IF THE BUTTER IS TOO COLD JUST USE A GRATER ON IT
TO MAKE AN ENJOYABLE SANDWICH
WITH THANKS TO THE COLONIALS IN THE FORMER COLONY OF THE AMERICAS
TOAST BACON PEANUT BUTTER TABASCO SAUCE SALAD LEAVES
ABORTION TO YOUR LIKING
ENJOY EVEN ON A FREEZING TUESDAY
I WAS RAISED WITH ALL THE BUTTER KEPT IN THE FRIDGE MY PARENTS WERE INTELLIGENT AND KNEW HOW TO COOK BUT WE NEVER HAD SPREADABLE BUTTER
BUT IT'S ONLY MARGARINALLY COLDER THAN YESTERDAY
WHY ARE YOU NOT SLICING THIN SLICES OFF THE BUTTER AND PRESSING THEM ONTO THE BREAD
NO HELP FOR INSTANT SANDWICHES BUT FOR PREPARING LUNCH TO TAKE TO WORK I KEEP A LOAF OF BREAD IN THE FREEZER FROZEN BREAD CAN STAND UP TO THE SPREADING OF HARD BUTTER IN THE EARLY MORNING AND IT'S COMPLETELY DEFROSTED BY LUNCHTIME
BUY A BUTTER BELL BEST THINGS EVER

DON'T EVEN START SWEDEN
I READ THAT AS BUTLER
TO REMIND YOU WHAT IT'S DOING TO YOUR ARTERIES NOT THAT ITS STOPPED ME EATING BUTTER FOR MY WHOLE LIFE
GOOD TIME TO TURN THE FRIDGE DOWN UP SO IT IS WARMER IN THERE
BY FAR THE MOST ANNOYING THING ABOUT WINTER IN THIS COUNTRY
GET YOURSELF A BUTTER BELL KEEPS THE BUTTER MOIST AND SOFT JUST MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE WATER OUT FREQUENTLY AND CLEAN THE DAMN THING
IF YOU HOLD THE KNIFE REASONABLE FLAT TO THE BUTTER AND SCRAPE IT OVER QUICKLY SEVERAL TIMES IT COMES OF IN SMALL LAYERS WHICH ARE MUCH EASIER TO SPREAD AND ALREADY ALMOST SHAPED THE WAY THEY'D GO ON THE TOAST
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE KEEP BUTTER IN THE FRIDGE AT ALL
THIS HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME ANYWAY HAHA
THIS HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME APART FROM A SHORT WEEK PERIOD EVERY OTHER AUGUST
RIGHT IN THE FEELS
I HAD THAT PROBLEM COS ITS ALWAYS COLD UP IN NORTHERN IRELAND BOUGHT THIS ON KICKSTARTER AND NEVER LOOKED BACK I HAVE NOT TORN BREAD SINCE
I MISREAD IT AS RIPPED A HOLE IN MY BEARD
MY MOTHER KEEPS HER BUTTER IN THE FRIDGE
USE BERTELLI INSTEAD IT'S A NICE OLIVE OIL ALTERNATIVE
FOR TOAST TAKE ONE SLICE OUT SCRAPE A THIN BIT OF BUTTER ONTO KNIFE SLAP IT ON THE HOT TOAST AND LEAVE IT NOW DO THE SAME WITH THE 2ND PIECE OF TOAST BY THIS TIME THE BUTTER ON THE FIRST PIECE IS SPREADABLE REPEAT FOR 2ND ENJOY
AS WE LEAVE EUROPE WE GO WEST AND NATURALLY GO INTO COLDER REGIONS S
DO THE MICROWAVE BUTTER ROULETTE JUST RIGHT N IT'S LOVELY TWO SECONDS TOO LONG ITS LIQUID NEVER TO RETURN TO ITS ORIGINAL FORM
IT'S THE WAY OF TELLING YOU YOU SHOULD BE EATING PORRIDGE AND FRY UPS
FREEZE YOUR BREAD AND MAKE YOUR SANDWICHES THE NIGHT BEFORE OR IN THE MORNING

COLD BUTTER WILL SPREAD ON FROZEN BREAD AND BY LUNCHTIME IT'LL BE DEFROSTED AND READY TO EAT
OH AND I'VE STARTED USING MAYO INSTEAD OF BUTTER ON ONE SLICE
IS YOUR REFRIGERATOR TEMP NOT REGULATED BIO YOU NOT KEEP BUTTER IN THE REFRIGERATOR
GRUMBLE GRUMBLE

I LOVE THE SMELL OF CHARRED DUST THE FIRST TIME A HEATER IS SWITCHED ON IT'S WHY I DELIBERATELY DON'T DUST THE HEATERS IN MY FLAT IT'S NOT LAZINESS AT ALL
AT MY WORK THEY SENT AN EMAIL SAYING WE'RE NOT ALLOWED PERSONAL HEATERS AND TO TAKE THEM HOME IF THEY'RE NOT GONE IN WEEK THEY'LL GO ROUND AND REMOVE THEM ALL BUT I WAS AWAY FOR 2 WEEKS AND DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE MINE HOME SO THEY STOLE IT I GOT IT BACK FROM THE MAINTENANCE GUYS AND TOOK IT STRAIGHT BACK TO MY OFFICE IT'S THE SMALL VICTORIES
I HATE THESE THINGS I'VE FINALLY MANAGED TO CONVINCE THE FACILITIES DEPT TO BAN THEM THEY'RE DANGEROUS AND COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY IN AN OFFICE UNLESS YOU WORK IN AN UNINSULATED OUT-BUILDING OF SOME SORT

EVEN SPENDING SOMETHING LIKE MORE IN IDL YOU GET RASHERS OF THEIR HIGHER QUALITY BACON I'VE BOUGHT ABOUT PACKS NOW AND I AM YET TO NOTICEABLY SEE MUCH SHRINKAGE THE FRYING PAN DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE BACON JUST WET ITSELF
I JUST GET MY BACON FROM MY LOCAL BUTCHER IT'S ALWAYS BETTER AND DOESN'T SHRINK IN THE PAN
A SLICE OF BACON AS THICK AS GAMMON IS BASICALLY A BACON CHOP AND BACON CHOPS ARE FUCKING AWESOME
BEEN LIVING IN AMERICA FOR YEARS GOD HOW I MISS BACON
R BRITISHSUCCESS IS THAT WAY
SINCE WHEN DO PEOPLE NOT LIKE I'M A CELEBRITY IT'S JUST ANT AND DEC PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY TORMENTING PEOPLE WHO USED TO BE FAMOUS

THOUGH I AGREE WITH THE REST OF YOU THAT THE X FACTOR NEEDS TO FUCK OFFICIAL
JUST BE GLAD NAKED JUNGLE DIDN'T TAKE OFFICIAL
I'M A CELEBRITY STRICTLY X FACTOR BRITAIN HAS MINIMAL TALENT BIG BROTHER ALL NEED TO GO

THEY HAVE BEEN GOING ON WAAAAY TOO LONG AND HAVE GOTTEN DESPERATE FOR VIEWS

WHIST ON THE SUBJECT SCRAP THE TV LICENCE I DON'T WATCH BBC WHY SHOULD I PAY FOR IT
I QUITE ENJOY IT
IT WOULD BE GOOD IF THEY USED MY DEFINITION OF CELEBRITY THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF THEM IN THE WORLD YOU NEED TO BE WELL KNOWN IN VAST AREAS OF THE WORLD THUS REMOVING SOAP OPERA STARS REALITY TV IDIOTS AND HANGERS ON NO PROPER BIG GENUINE CELEBRITY WOULD DO THAT CRAP SO WE COULD CANCEL IT ALONG WITH EVERY OTHER CELEBRITY VERSION OF EVERYTHING
DELETED
SADLY YES BUT EDH FORGET THE TELE THERE IS NETFLIX
THE CURSE OF THE BILLY GOAT HAS FOUND A NEW TARGET TO PICK ON

YEARS LATER THERE'LL BE A PARTY IN NEWCASTLE A NORTHERN TRAIN HAS ACTUALLY MADE IT ON TIME
FINALLY A PROPER USE OF THE WORD CACTOID CONSIDER MY CAP DOFFED TO YOU SIR
NOW I MISS THEM AND I NEVER EVEN KNEW THEY EXISTED
WATCHED MINUTES OF A CELEBRITY COME DINE WITH ME THE OTHER DAY BEFORE I REALISED IT WAS A CELEBRITY ONE
WELL WE AIN'T EXACTLY ABOUT TO SEE MAGGIE SMITH AND HELEN MIRREN BOND OVER OSTRICH TESTICLES WHILE MERYL STREEP JUMPS OFF A HELICOPTER ARE WE
I'M A CELEBRITY PAY ME TO GET ME IN HERE
DANNY BAKER IS AN ACTUAL CELEBRITY AND SO IS CAROL VORDERPERSON FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE THE BLOKE FROM HOMES UNDER THE HAMMER I ACTIVELY KNOW FROM A PLACE THAT ISN'T A REALITY SHOW OF SOME DESCRIPTION

AT LEAST I'D HEARD OF ALL BUT TWO OF THEM DOESN'T MEAN I'M ABOUT TO WATCH IT
ITS ALWAYS THE SAME ALONG WITH CELEB BB I'M A CELEBRITY IS FULL OF WASHED UP CELEBS EITHER TAKING WHAT THEY CAN GET OR TRYING TO SAVE THEIR CAREER NEVER WORKS THOUGH
TO BE FAIR ACROSS ALL THE YEARS THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH CELEBRITIES TO DO THE SHOW ONCE
THANK YOU FOR WRITING IT OUT IN FULL STRICTLY AND I'M A CELEBRITY SET MY TEETH ON EDGE
BACK WHEN THERE WAS SOMETHING I WATCHED AFTER STRICTLY COME DANCING MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOCTOR WHO I LIKED TO PLAY THE GAME OF GUESSING WHO WAS THE CELEBRITY AND WHO THE PROFESSIONAL DANCER WHEN THEY RECAPPED THE PERFORMANCES AT THE END OF THE SHOW I WAS ALWAYS SUPER IMPRESSED WITH MYSELF WHEN I ACTUALLY RECOGNISED ONE AINSLEY HARRIOTT COMES TO MIND BUT I THINK HE WAS THE ONLY ONE I HAD A CLUE ABOUT THAT TIME

THIS SEASON OF STRICTLY I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WATCHING WHEN I REMEMBER AM BABYSITTING WHY BECAUSE ED BALLS HE'S SO ENTERTAINING TO WATCH

THAT SAID WHEN POINTLESS CELEBRITIES HAD THEIR EPISODE I KNEW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM AND I BET THERE WERE LOADS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ALL LIKE WHO THE FUCK IS CHRISTIAN HORNER BECAUSE THEY DON'T WATCH
EVERY YEAR THE SAME MOANING COMPLAINT EVEN IF YOU HAVE LIVED ON THE MOON FOR THE LAST YEARS AND REALLY DON'T KNOW ANY OF THEM IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE WITHOUT FAIL EVERY YEAR THE CONTESTANTS ARE A GOOD MIX THAT DON'T FAIL TO ENTERTAIN
IT USUALLY HAS SOME ACTUAL CELEBS DAVID HAYE AND DOM JOLLY COME TO MIND
SHOULD REALLY BE RENAMED I'M A NONENTITY JUST IGNORE ME
LITTLE UPSET THAT NIGEL DIDN'T ACCEPT THE OFFER TO GO ON I SUPPOSE HE IF HE WAS ALLOWED TO RETIRE
CELEBRITY NOWADAYS MEANS BEING FAMOUS FOR FAMOUS SAKE I EAST THOSE TALENTLESS INTERCHANGEABLE FUCKS ON ANY REALITY PROGRAM
YURI GELLER IS A CELEBRITY
IT'S GETTING LIKE THAT WITH STRICTLY NOW TOO WHICH IS A SHAME IF I CAN'T TELL WHICH ONE IS THE NEW PROFESSIONAL AND WHICH IS THE CELEBRITY IT KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE SOMEWHAT
THEY NEED TO SLIP A FEW BLACK WIDOWS AND COUPLE OF KING PYTHONS INTO THE JUNGLE YOU KNOW TO MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING
QUITE IMPRESSED THAT I ACTUALLY KNOW PEOPLE THIS YEAR THERE ARE ONLY 2 I HADN'T HEARD OF NOT SURE IF THAT SAYS MORE ABOUT ME OR THE SHOW THOUGH
THIS YEAR'S LINE-UP WHO'S THAT WHO'S HE NEVER HEARD OF HERALDRY WASN'T HE IN SOME OTHER REALITY SHOW SO SHE'S FAMOUS FOR BEING FAMOUS WHAT'S HE EVER DONE OH IT'S CAROL VORDERMAN
LISA SNOWDON IS GRADE A AP MATERIAL THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS
I'M INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED PERHAPS JUST WITH MYSELF THIS YEAR I RECOGNISED OF THE CELEBRITIES CAROL VORDERMAN SCARLETT MOFFATT JOEL DOMETT LISA SNOWDON
REAL BRITISH PROBLEM PEOPLE STILL WATCH THIS

STRICTLY AND BAKE OFF AND EVEN GOD FORBID MIGHT ACTUALLY INVOLVE SOME SKILL AND TALENT I CAN FORGIVE WATCHING THEM IF IT'S HOW YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR TIME THIS IS JUST GAWPING AT OTHER HUMANS SITTING IN A CAMP IT'S BRAINDEAD
OH SNAP

THE DAILY EXPRESS HAS BEEN WARNING US ABOUT THE COMING SNOW SINCE JUNE SO EVERYONE SHOULD BE PREPARED
IT'S TOO COLD TO SNOW AT THE MOMENT WAIT TILL IT WARMS UP THEN IT'LL SNOW THATS THE THEORY
SNOW WHERE WHEN
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SNOW OKAY IT'S NOT GONNA BE FUN WALKING TO WORK IN BUT THERE'S NO FEELING SO WARM AS BEING INDOORS WRAPPED UP CANDLES LIT WHILE IT'S SNOWING OUTSIDE
WELL IT SNOWED WE'VE GOT AN INCH NOT THE FEET OF THE STUFF EVERYONE WAS PANICKING ABOUT

BUSSES THE LOT OF THEM
YOU KNOW WHAT I'D MUCH RATHER HEAR ABOUT ALEXANDER NEW FOLK ALBUM THAN ANY OF THE ACTUAL NEWS THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IT'S ALL SHIT

ALSO GOOD FOR ALEXANDER ARMSTRONG HE'S A BUSY MAN PRESENTING POINTLESS AND A CLASSIC FM SHOW SO PUTTING OUT AN ALBUM AT THE SAME TIME AS ALL THAT MUST TAKE SOME DEDICATION
ALL I HEAR ABOUT IS THE SODDING CAPITAL JINGLE BELL BLOODY BALL IT'LL BE THE FIRST NEWS ITEM FOR WEEKS
DON'T REALLY SEE HOW THIS IS A PROBLEM PUT THE NEWS ON IN BRITAIN AND GET BRITISH NEWS SOUNDS CORRECT

ALSO CONSIDERING THAT I HAVE SEEN LOADS OF POSTS THIS WEEK MOANING ABOUT THE NEWS BEING FULL OF US ELECTIONS AND WORLD SERIES RESULTS I'D SAY YOU WERE IN A MINORITY

IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AMERICA TURN ON THE AMERICAN NEWS
IT'S JIMMY YOUNG DAY I KEEP SEEING JIMMY HILLS CHIN IN MY HEAD I KNOW THE WOGAN BUT UNSURE ON JIMMY YOUNG I'M TOO YOUNG I SUPPOSE
I DON'T EVEN GET WHY THERE'S APPARENTLY SO MUCH RACISM SHE LOOKS WHITE TO ME
ALEXANDER RELEASING A FOLK ALBUM
KERNING
PICTURES
RUB SOME BUTTER ON EM IF THATS NOT TOO HARD ASWELL
THE SIZE OF THE PACKAGING REMAINING THE SAME IS THE KICK IN THE TEETH THOUGH THEY CHANGED THE LOOK OF IT TO HIDE THAT THEY MADE THE BAR SMALLER WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE WEIGHT OF IT MADE THE BAR SLIGHTLY SMALLER DON'T CHANGE AN ICONIC LOOK AND DON'T WAIT UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN FOUND OUT BEFORE COMMENTING ON IT THIS ANNOYS ME WAY MORE THAN IT SHOULD
THEY'RE PROBABLY STRUGGLING BECAUSE PEOPLE BARELY EVEN BUY
PROBLEM SOLVED

HOST CREATIVE
CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM
WOW FIRST CREME EGGS NOW TOBLERONE

MONDELEZ ARE MONSTERS I'D BE HAPPY TO SUCK UP THE INCREASED PRICE SO THAT THEY DIDN'T MESS WITH THE FORMULA CREME EGGS WERE A HOUSEHOLD DELIGHT FOR YEARS BEFORE THEY GOT THEIR GRUBBY HANDS ON THEM
TEXTING THE FAMILY NOW TO REMOVE THEM FROM MY XMAS WISH LIST HOPE I GET A BOX OF STARBOARD AGAIN
MY INTEREST RATE AND NOW THIS IT CAN'T GET ANY WORSE
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE AND YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHY US COMPANIES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF BRITISH CONFECTIONERY

WORSE STILL WHEN YOU GO TO OPEN IT THIS CHRISTMAS IT'S GOING TO BE A LOTTERY ON WHETHER YOU GET A GOOD ONE OR A BAD ONE SO THANKS FOR SPOILING CHRISTMAS AS WELL

BASICALLY THEY COME ALONG SAY IT IS NOT WHAT WE LIKE SO WE ARE CHANGING IT WHY THE FUCK DID YOU BUY IT TO START WITH IT'S NOT LIKE YOU PICKED UP A STARTUP AND ARE MAKING IT WORK THIS IS HISTORY AND TRADITION YOU ARE FUCKING WITH

AND IN LINE WITH BRITISH TRADITION I'M GOING TO GIVE THIS A GOOD STERN AND SCORNFUL LOOK OF DISTAIN
EVEN PORN STARS ARE UPSET OVER THE TOBLERONE TRAVESTY HEHE
NO THEY FUCKING DON'T HAVE YOU SEEN THE WEARY FACES OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE SUNDARBANS ONE MINUTE YOU'RE DOING THE LAUNDRY NEXT YOUR TIGER FOOD
COULD BE WORSE COULD BE THE COSTA WILTSHIRE HAM CHEESE ONE ARGUABLY BETTER THAN THEIR NORMAL ONE WITH CHEESE ON TOP AS WELL AS INSIDE I'M ADDICTED
ME TOO THEY ARE RATHER MOREISH AREN'T THEY
THEY ARE MY FAVOURITE TOO
I TRIED A BALANCED KANSU CHICKEN SLICE THE OTHER DAY IT'S LIQUID CURRY IN A CARDBOARD BULGE TOTAL WANK
NOPE THOUGHT IT SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD IDEA AND IT TASTED LIKE I WAS CHOWING DOWN ON A DOGSHIP WRAPPED IN PASTRY
THERE'S STEAK AND STILTON SAUSAGE ROLLS

BUGGER ME I'LL HAVE TO GO INTO A GREGGS
IN THE BIBLE NAHUM IT'S NOT
IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS AN ETYMOLOGIST THEN SAYING IT CAN BE A BIT DICEY
I WISH THIS ERROR WOULD JUST DICE ALREADY
BUT ONLY A PROBLEM FOR PEDANTS
I WAS GOING TO ASK IF THIS WAS CRAWLEY BUT LOOKING AT YOUR FLAIR PROBABLY NOT THE GUY WHO WORKS IN THE TICKET OFFICE THERE IS AN EVIL PRICK WHO GETS OFF ON DENYING EVERYONE EVERYTHING BUT THE CRUEL TWIST IS HE LOOKS LIKE BOB ROSS
PEAK
I'M NOT MUCH OF A COMPLAINER BUT I WOULD MAKE A FORMAL COMPLAINT ABOUT THAT
THAT'S UTTER BOLLOCKS THE BLOKES A TOTAL JOBS WORTH
SINCE WHEN IS IT ANY BUSINESS OF THE TICKET OFFICE PEOPLE WHETHER YOUR TICKET IS VALID FOR IMMEDIATE TRAVEL WITHIN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES OR NOT THAT'S BETWEEN YOU AND THE GUARD IS IT NOT

RIDICULOUS JOBSWORTHS
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON NOT BECAUSE HE'S EGOTISTICAL MADMAN WHO WANTS WAR WITH EVERYONE
YOU'RE DOING THAT THING THE WIFE DOES SHE STARTS OFF WITH I AND THEN IT BECOMES WE BUT SHE REALLY MEANT YOU
AND HOW QUICKLY HE'LL GET HIS LAWYERS OUT TO SUE ALL THE WOMEN WHO ACCUSED HIM IS HIS BITE AS BAD AS HIS BARK WOOF WOOF
IT WON'T EXACTLY GO INTO MELTDOWN THOUGH THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED CONSPIRACY THEORISTS WILL HAVE ENOUGH MATERIAL TO FEAST ON FOR MONTHS
I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMING POGROM OF NON WHITE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING
I HAVE SAID THIS MORE THAN ONCE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE MY BROKEN AND I'VE HAD NO HOT WATER OR HEATING FOR A WEEK AND A HALF

GETTING IT REPLACED ON FRIDAY THOUGH BECAUSE I JUST HATE HAVING TOO MUCH MONEY IN MY SAVINGS
THE WINTER IS THE BEST SEASON THERE IS
I HAVE A PULLED SHOULDER I NEED TO KEEP IT RELAXED THE COLD MEANS I'M HUNCHED UP AND SHIVERING WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF RELAXED
I HATE HOW DARK IT IS AND THE COLD IS AGGRAVATING MY BAD KNEE
AND IT'S NOT EVEN WINTER YET
I'VE ALREADY HAD ENOUGH OF WINTER BECAUSE WE RECENTLY GOT A SMART METRE FITTED AND ALSO HAVE AN MONTH OLD BABY SO WE'RE TRYING TO NOT USE SO MUCH GAS AND ELECTRIC BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO FREEZE TO DEATH
IT FEELS LIKE I'VE BEEN SMACKED IN THE FACE WITH WINTER AND I'M NOT OVERLY OKAY WITH THAT

WORKING TILL TONIGHT SO THAT SOUNDS LIKE NO FUN
I LOVE WINTER WEATHER FOR BEING OUTSIDE BUT BEING ILL AND STUCK INSIDE A DANCE HOUSE WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAT SITTING WITH LAYERS AND LAYERS ON INCLUDING A BLANKET WITH A FAN HEATER DIRECTED STRAIGHT AT ME IS NOT FUN AND IS GOING TONIGHT A FORTUNE

I NORMALLY LOVE WINTER THAT HAS CHANGED THIS YEAR I ALWAYS HATE THE FACT IT IS DARK WHEN YOU START WORK AND DARK WHEN YOU FINISH TOO BUT I CAN NORMALLY DEAL WITH THAT WHEN THERE ARE UPSIDES
COME ON NOW IT'LL BE ALL OVER IN ANOTHER DAYS DEPENDING ON WHO WINS
SKY

WELL THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM
I'VE ENDED UP PUTING A FIFTY QUID BET ON TRUMP TO WIN THIS WAY I WILL BE HAPPY IF HE LOSES COS LIKE NOT THE END OF CIVILISATION AS WE KNOW IT AND AT LEAST HAVE SOME MONEY TO BLOW IF HE WINS WHILE THE WORLD BURNS
EMBRACE IT I SPENT MINUTES LISTENING TO A NEW ZEALAND RADIO STATION YESTERDAY IN ORDER TO CATCH A MINUTE SEGMENT WITH A POLLING EXPERT ABOUT EARLY VOTING TURNOUT NUMBERS IN FLORIDA


ON REFLECTION I MAY HAVE A PROBLEM
IT'S LIKE THE UK HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THATCHER AND A REANIMATED DUG-UP THATCHER AN AWFUL DECISION EITHER WAY
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE BUSES THAT GOT THEIR SAFELY COUNTRIES NOT HAVING ELECTIONS TV WHY DON'T YOU COVER THEM
IT'S ONLY FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO

THEN AT LEAST WHOEVER WINS THERE'LL BE A LOT LESS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE WHOLE THING AND WE CAN THEN GET ON WITH THE IMPORTANT TASK AT HAND OF LAUGHING AT AMERICA FOR CLEARLY BEING LESS CAPABLE THAN WE ARE AT MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS
TO BE FAIR THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST INTERESTING ELECTION ANYWHERE IN GOOD WHILE EVEN IF JUST FOR THE SPECTACLE OF
IM A BIG FAN OF AMERICAN HISTORY SO TO ME ITS NICE TO BE AROUND TO SEE THE END OF IT ALL
IT WILL AFFECT THE ENTIRE WORLD YOU MAY NOT CARE BUT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TRY AND AT LEAST FEIGN A MILD INTEREST
I HATE TO SAY IT BUT NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE A COLONY
THE REAL ISSUE IS GETTING YOUR NEWS FROM SKY
I'M SICK OF IT I COULDN'T GIVE A FUCK WHO WINS THEY'RE BOTH SHITTY CANDIDATES WHO ARE AS BAD AS EACH OTHER I'M SICK OF THE INCREDIBLY BIASED US MEDIA AND I'M SICK THAT WE HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT EVERY DAY
YOUR PROBLEM IS THAT YOU GET YOUR NEWS FROM SKY
SORRY ABOUT THAT WE PROMISE WE'LL TRY TO KEEP THE NOISE DOWN AFTER TOMORROW

I'M NOT SAYING WE WILL BUT WE'LL TRY

EDIT I AM SO GODS DAMNED SORRY WE TRIED AND NOW WE'VE DAMNED YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH OUR BULLSHIT FOR AT LEAST FOUR YEARS I AM SO FUCKING SORRY
ON BEHALF OF AMERICA WE'RE SORRY THIS HAPPENED BEAR WITH US FOR A SHORT TIME LONGER AND WE WILL DEFEAT THE FASCIST THREAT I THINK THE WEST NEEDS TO HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT PUTIN IT'S CLEAR HE IS MEDDLING
I'M ALREADY FED UP
MEANWHILE I CAN ONLY GET WHISPERS OF BREVIT DID YOU GUYS BREVIT BREVIT
