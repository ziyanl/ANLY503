<p>
<dt>Upon the hopeless desert of her love
<dt>I landed, lured by glamour of her face.
<dt>And, scarce on shore,--a desolate strange place,--
<dt>I said,--but surely some green cedar grove
<dt>Awaits me, proffering its cooling shade,
<dt>And in its depths melodious fountains spring;
<dt>So tear the canvas from the masts and bring
<dt>Planks, beams, and spars until the pile be laid.
<dt>Then with my own mad hands I lit the fire,
<dt>And watched with fevered eyes the dark mass burn,
<dt>So blotting out the prospect of return.
<dt>But daily cools the pulse of my desire,
<dt>And bitter is the redness of her lips.
<dt>Oh! god of love, why did I burn my ships?

<a name=020></a><h2>Outre-Mort</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Suppose the dreaded messenger of death
<dt>Should hasten steps that seem, though sure, so slow,
<dt>And soon should whisper with his chilly breath:
<dt>"Arise! thine hour has sounded, thou must go;
<dt>For they that earliest taste life's holiest feast
<dt>Must early fast, lest, grown too bold, they dare
<dt>Of them that follow after seize the share."
<p>
<dt>Then, though my pulse's beat forever ceased,
<dt>If where I slumbered thou shouldst chance to pass,
<dt>Though grave-bound, I thy presence should discern,
<dt>Heedless of coffin-lid and tangled grass,
<dt>Upward to kiss thy feet my lips would yearn;
<dt>And did one spark of love thy heart inflame,
<dt>With the old rapture I should call thy name.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Bondage</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>"And this is freedom?" cried the serf. "At last
<dt>I tread free soil, the free air blows on me;"
<dt>And, wild to learn the sweets of liberty,
<dt>With eager hope his bosom bounded fast.
<dt>But not for naught had the long years amassed
<dt>Habit of slavery; among the free
<dt>He still was servile, and, disheartened, he
<dt>Crept back to the old bondage of the past.
<dt>Long did I bear a hard and heavy chain
<dt>Wreath&egrave;d with amaranth and asphodel,
<dt>But through the flower-breaths stole the heavy pain.
<dt>I cast it off and fled, but 'twas in vain;
<dt>For when once more I passed by where it fell,
<dt>I took it up and bound it on again.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Communion</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>One cannot draw the bars against the friends
<dt>And guests that crowd for entrance at his gate
<dt>He opes, inviting, nor the simple state
<dt>Of his abode against their train defends,
<dt>But there are chambers where the lover tends
<dt>His sacred fires; where no feet penetrate,
<dt>Save of immortals; where, early and late,
<dt>The breath of prayer and sacrifice ascends.
<dt>In such a spot as this, as in the shrine
<dt>Of some white temple, in a dusk made sweet
<dt>With incense, far from outer noise and heat,
<dt>And hollow haste of them that part and meet,
<dt>Surrounded by dim presences divine,
<dt>My soul communes eternally with thine.
