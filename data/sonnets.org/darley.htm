<dt>Whilst the moon decks herself in Neptune's glass
<dt>And ponders over her image in the sea,
<dt>Her cloudy locks smoothing from off her face
<dt>That she may all as bright as beauty be;
<dt>It is my wont to sit upon the shore
<dt>And mark with what an even grace she glides
<dt>Her two concurrent paths of azure o'er,
<dt>One in the heavens, the other in the tides:
<dt>Now with a transient veil her face she hides
<dt>And ocean blackens with a human frown;
<dt>Now her fine screen of vapour she divides
<dt>And looks with all her light of beauty down;
<dt>Her splendid smile over-silvering the main
<dt>Spreads her the glass she looks into again.

<p>
<dt>You, the choice minions of the proud-lipped nine
<dt>Who warble at the great Apollo's knee,
<dt>Why do you laugh at these rude lays of mine?
<dt>I seek not of your brotherhood to be:
<dt>I do not play the public swan, nor try
<dt>To curve my proud neck on your vocal streams.
<dt>In my own little isle retreated, I
<dt>Lost myself in my waters and my dreams:
<dt>Forgetful of the world, forgotten too,
<dt>The cygnet of my own secluded wave
<dt>I sing, whilst dashing up their silver dew
<dt>For joy, the petty billows try to rave:
<dt>There is a still applause in solitude,
<dt>Fitting alike my merits and my mood.
