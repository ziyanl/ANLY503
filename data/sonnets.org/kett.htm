<p>
<dt>In Mary's absence, reason gains his throne,
<dt>And binds with stricter chains the struggling breast;
<dt>Scared at his angry frown and stern behest
<dt>Love spreads his wings and flies with many a moan.
<dt>When Mary comes with vermeil-tinctured cheek,
<dt>With graceful mien and mirth-awakening eye,
<dt>Prudence, disarmed, forsakes his ground, to fly,
<dt>And reason's chains, as touched by magic, break.
<p>
<dt>Thus when the chilling blast transforms to frost
<dt>The night-born dews that bathe the polished glass,
<dt>The roving eye, in pleasing error lost,
<dt>Sees rock and woods crowd the fantastic mass;
<dt>But soon as shines the sun's meridian ray
<dt>The icy prospect melts in streams away.
