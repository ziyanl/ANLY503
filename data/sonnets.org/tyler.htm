<p><h2><i>From <a href="bibliogr.htm#sterner">The Sonnet in American Literature</a></i></h2>

<p>The next [second] American sonneteer is Royall Tyler (1757-1826), the author of <i>The Contrast</i>, our first comedy, and the second play by an American to be produced in America by a professional company. Tyler's two sonnets are found in <i>The Spirit of the Farmers' Museum and the Lay Preacher's Gazette</i>, Walpole, N.H., 1801, under the caption "From the Shop of Messrs. Colon & Spondee." This pseudonym covered the prose of Joseph Dennie and the poetry, chiefly satire and parody, of Royall Tyler.

<p>Tyler's two sonnets are best introduced in his own words:

<blockquote>The plaintive and affected style of <a href="smith.htm">Charlotte Smith</a> is familiar, it is supposed, to most readers. Criticism has frowned upon the verbose grief of a sobbing poetess. . . . We insert the following as a pleasant introduction to an attack soon to be made upon the above sighing sonneteer from the Shop of Colon and Spondee.</blockquote>
<p>[Smith published in Philadelphia in 1787 an edition of her "Elegiac Sonnets."]

<p>
<dt>And this reft house is that the which he built,
<dt>Lamented Jack! and here his malt he pil'd,
<dt>Cautious in vain! These rats that squeak so wild,
<dt>Squeak, not unconscious of their father's guilt.
<dt>Did ye not see her gleaming through the glade!
<dt>Belike, 't was she, the maiden all forlorn.
<dt>What tho' she, the maiden all forlorn.
<dt>What tho' she milk no cow with crumpled horn,
<dt>Yet, aye, she haunts the dale where erst she stray'd;
<dt>And aye, beside her stalks her amorous knight!
<dt>Still on his thighs their wonted brogues are worn,
<dt>And thro' those brogues, still tatter'd and betorn,
<dt>His hindward charms gleam an unearthly white;
<dt>As when thro' broken clouds at night's high noon
<dt>Peeps in fair fragments forth the full orb'd harvest moon.

<p>
<dt>Child of lubricious art, of sanguine sport!
<dt>Of pangful mirth! sweet ermin'd sprite!
<dt>Who lov'st, with silent, velvet step, to court
<dt>The bashful bosom of the night.
<dt>Whose elfin eyes can pierce night's sable gloom,
<dt>And witch her fairy prey with guile,
<dt>Who sports fell frolic o'er the grisly tomb,
<dt>And gracest death with dimpling smile!
<dt>Daughter of ireful mirth, sportive in rage,
<dt>Whose joy should shine in sculptur'd bas relief
<dt>Like Patience, in rapt Shakespeare's deathless page,
<dt>Smiling in marble at wan grief.
<dt>Oh, come, and teach me all thy barb'rous joy,
<dt>To sport with sorrow first, and then destroy.
