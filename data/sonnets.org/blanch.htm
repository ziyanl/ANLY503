<p>
<dt>Pale pilgrim of the heavens, that late didst glide
<dt>With sunbeam staff the violet vales along,
<dt>Where fountains of fresh dew gushed up in song,
<dt>To bathe thy golden feet and then subside--
<dt>Last wave that sparkled on time's ebbing tide--
<dt>How are thy bright limbs laid amid the throng
<dt>Of vanished days, that drooped over earthly wrong,
<dt>Seeing how virtue is to vice allied,
<dt>And vanished blushingly.
<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sad Yesterday!
<dt>Night's winding-sheet is round thee, and the eyes
<dt>That found a health or fever in thy ray
<dt>And thoughtfully perused on evening skies
<dt>Thine elegy, star-lettered--now away
<dt>Turn their brief thoughts of thee, and thus men moralize.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>To-day</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A liberal worldling, gay philosopher,
<dt>Art thou that liftst thy young and yellow head
<dt>Over the dim burial of the scarce-cold dead,
<dt>Building above thy brother's sepulchre
<dt>A home of love that sense might almost err,
<dt>Deeming thy end therein to woo and wed
<dt>The flower-haired earth for ever. Yet the red
<dt>In yonder west may well such dreams deter!
<p>
<dt>Yes, thou, all-hailed To-day! whose outstretched hand
<dt>Scatters loose riches on a bankrupt land,
<dt>Even thou art but a leaf from off the tree
<dt>Of yellowing time; a grain of glistening sand
<dt>Dashed from the waters of that unsailed sea
<dt>Where thou to-night shalt sink, and I as soon may be.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Gaily and greenly let my seasons run:
<dt>And should the war-winds of the world uproot
<dt>The sanctities of life, and its sweet fruit
<dt>Cast forth as fuel for the fiery sun;
<dt>The dews be turned to ice--fair days begun
<dt>In peace wear out in pain, and sounds that suit
<dt>Despair and discord keep Hope's harp-string mute;
<dt>Still let me live as Love and Life were one:
<dt>Still let me turn on earth a child-like gaze,
<dt>And trust the whispered charities that bring
<dt>Tidings of human truth; with inward praise
<dt>Watch the weak motion of each common thing
<dt>And find it glorious--still let me raise
<dt>On wintry wrecks an altar to the Spring.
