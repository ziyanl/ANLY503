<a name=101></a><h2>On Poet-Ape</h2><img align=right src="ape.gif">
<P>
<dt>Poor Poet-Ape, that would be thought our chief,
<dt>Whose works are e'en the frippery of wit,
<dt>From brokage is become so bold a thief,
<dt>As we, the robbed, leave rage, and pity it.
<dt>At first he made low shifts, would pick and glean,
<dt>Buy the reversion of old plays; now grown
<dt>To a little wealth, and credit in the scene,
<dt>He takes up all, makes each man's wit his own.
<dt>And, told of this, he slights it.  Tut, such crimes
<dt>The sluggish gaping auditor devours;
<dt>He marks not whose 'twas first, and after-times
<dt>May judge it to be his, as well as ours.
<dt>Fool, as if half eyes will not know a fleece
<dt>From locks of wool, or shreds from the whole piece.
