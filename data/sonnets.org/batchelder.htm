School, Concord, N.H." (<a href="bibliogr.htm#crandall">Crandall</a>)
<h2>    February</h2>
<p>
<dt>The old, old wonder of the lengthening days
<dt>Is with us once again; the winter's sun,
<dt>Slow sinking to the west when day is done,
<dt>Each eve a little longer with us stays,
<dt>And cheers the snowy landscape with his rays:
<dt>Nor do we notice what he has begun
<dt>Until a month or more of days have run,
<dt>When we exclaim: "How long the light delays!"
<dt>
<dt>So let some kindly deed, however slight,
<dt>Be daily done by us, that to the waste
<dt>Of selfishness some light it may impart,—
<dt>Mayhap not noticed till we feel the night
<dt>Is less witihin our souls, and broader-spaced
<dt>Has grown the cheerful sunshine of the heart.
<dt>
