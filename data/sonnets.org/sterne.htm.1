<h2><a name="eternal"></a>"From out eternal silence do we come"</h2>
<p>
<dt>From out eternal silence do we come,
<dt>Into eternal silence do we go;
<dt>For was there not a time, and swift or slow
<dt>Must come again, when all this world's loud hum
<dt>Was naught to us, and shall again grow dumb
<dt>Through all eternity?--Between two low,
<dt>Dark, stony portals, with much empty show
<dt>Of tinkling brass and sounding fife and drum,
<dt>The endless Caravan of Life moves on;
<dt>Or whence or whither, to what destiny,
<dt>But He who dwells beyond the farthest dawn
<dt>Knows, yet reveals not, evermore even He
<dt>In silence wrapt, for all the thunders roll,
<dt>Save for His deathless message to our soul!

Transformation</h2>       
<dt>
"Give me the wine of happiness," I cried,       
<dt>
"The bread of life!— O ye benign, unknown,       
<dt>
Immortal powers!— I crave them for my own,       
<dt>
I am athirst, I will not be denied       
<dt>
Though Hell were up in arms!"&nbsp; No sound replied,       
<dt>
But, turning back to my rude board and lone,       
<dt>
My soul, confounded, there beheld— a stone,       
<dt>
Pale water in a shallow cup beside!       
<dt>       
<dt>
With gushing tears, in utter hopelessness,       
<dt>
I stood and gazed.&nbsp; Then rose a voice that spoke,—  
       
<dt>
"God gave this, too, and what He gives will bless!"       
<dt>
And 'neath the hands that trembling took and broke,       
<dt>
Lo, truly a sweet miracle divine,       
<dt>
The stone turned bread, the water ruby wine!       
<dt>
<h2><a name="solitude"></a>Solitude</h2>       
<dt>
I love thee, O thou Beautiful and Strong,       
<dt>
Invisible comrade, mute, sweet company,       
<dt>
More dear than friend or lover!&nbsp; But to thee       
<dt>
My fondest hopes, my fairest dreams, belong       
<dt>
Forevermore!&nbsp; Amid the world's gay throng       
<dt>
I yearn for thy soft arms that lovingly       
<dt>
Soothe all the fevered wounds once fretting me.       
<dt>
At thy deep heart there springs the fount of song       
<dt>       
<dt>
Whose drops shall cool my burning lips athirst,—       
<dt>
At thy swift beck within my sight arise       
<dt>
(Their bonds of silence and dim darkness burst)       
<dt>
All my beloved dead, with shining eyes,—       
<dt>
At thy blest hand, by starlit paths untrod,       
<dt>
My soul draws near unto the face of God!       
<dt>
<h2><a name="silence"></a>Silence</h2>       
<dt>
Ay, and thee, too, who wield'st a power divine,       
<dt>
Greater than loudest speech or fairest lay!       
<dt>
The dead, millions on millions, own thy sway       
<dt>
In realms where suns to rise no more, decline.       
<dt>
Thine is the lover's sweetest rapture, thine       
<dt>
the deepest cup of grief or joy that aye       
<dt>
The lips of mortal tasted, thine— yet stay!       
<dt>
How may I name thee, with what sound so fine       
<dt>       
<dt>
It shall not snap thy life's frail, golden thread?       
<dt>
O Solitude and Silence, bid me learn       
<dt>
A little of your greatness!&nbsp; Long are fled       
<dt>
The lesser gods of life, now let me turn       
<dt>
To ye alone, to ye in worship come,       
<dt>
The accents of this faltering tongue grown 
dumb!</dt>
