<h3>1</h3>
<p>
<dt>"Why are your songs all wild and bitter sad
<dt>As funeral dirges with the orphans' cries?
<dt>Each night since first the world was made hath had
<dt>A sequent day to laugh it down the skies.
<dt>Chant us a glee to make our hearts rejoice,
<dt>Or seal in silence this unmanly moan."
<dt>My friend, I have no power to rule my voice--
<dt>A spirit lifts me where I lie alone,
<dt>And thrills me into song by its own laws;
<dt>That which I feel, but seldom know, indeed
<dt>Tempering the melody it could not cause.
<dt>The bleeding heart cannot forever bleed
<dt>Inwardly solely; on the wan lips, too,
<dt>Dark blood will bubble ghastly into view.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Striving to sing glad songs, I but attain
<dt>Wild discords sadder than Grief's saddest tune;
<dt>As if an owl with his harsh screech should strain
<dt>To over-gratulate a thrush of June.
<dt>The nightingale upon its thorny spray
<dt>Finds inspiration in the sullen dark;
<dt>The kindling dawn, the world-wide joyous day
<dt>Are inspiration to the soaring lark;
<dt>The seas are silent in the sunny calm,
<dt>Their anthem surges in the tempest boom;
<dt>The skies outroll no solemn thunder psalm
<dt>Till they have clothed themselves with clouds of gloom.
<dt>My mirth can laugh and talk, but cannot sing;
<dt>My grief finds harmonies in everything.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>A Recusant</h2>
<p>
<dt>The Church stands there beyond the orchard-blooms:
<dt>How yearningly I gaze upon its spire!
<dt>Lifted mysterious through the twilight glooms,
<dt>Dissolving in the sunset's golden fire,
<dt>Or dim as slender incense morn by morn
<dt>Ascending to the blue and open sky.
<dt>For ever when my heart feels most forlorn
<dt>It murmurs to me with a weary sigh,
<dt>How sweet to enter in, to kneel and pray
<dt>With all the others whom we love so well!
<dt>All disbelief and doubt might pass away,
<dt>All peace float to us with its Sabbath bell.
<dt>Conscience replies, There is but one good rest,
<dt>Whose head is pillowed upon Truth's pure breast.
