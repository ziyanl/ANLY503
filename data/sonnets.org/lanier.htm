<a name=050></a><h2>The Harlequin of Dreams</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Swift, through some trap mine eyes have never found,
<dt>Dim-panelled in the painted scene of sleep,
<dt>Thou, giant Harlequin of Dreams, dost leap
<dt>Upon my spirit’s stage.  Then Sight and Sound,
<dt>Then Space and Time, then Language, Mete and Bound,
<dt>And all familiar Forms that firmly keep
<dt>Man’s reason in the road, change faces, peep
<dt>Betwixt the legs and mock the daily round.
<dt>Yet thou canst more than mock: sometimes my tears
<dt>At midnight break through bounden lids--a sign
<dt>Thou hast a heart: and oft thy little leaven
<dt>Of dream-taught wisdom works me bettered years.
<dt>In one night witch, saint, trickster, fool divine,
<dt>I think thou’rt Jester at the Court of Heaven.
<p>
<a name=075></a><h2>Laus Mariae</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Across the brook of Time man leaping goes
<dt>On stepping-stones of epochs, that uprise
<dt>Fixed, memorable, midst broad shallow flows
<dt>Of neutrals, kill-times, sleeps, indifferencies.
<dt>So mixt each morn and night rise salient heaps:
<dt>Some cross with but a zig-zag, jaded pace
<dt>From meal to meal: some with convulsive leaps
<dt>Shake the green tussocks of malign disgrace:
<dt>And some advance by system and deep art
<dt>O’er vantages of wealth, place, learning, tact:
<dt>But thou within thyself, dear manifold heart,
<dt>Dost bind all epochs in one dainty Fact.
<dt>Oh, sweet, my pretty sum of history,
<dt>I leapt the breadth of Time in loving thee!
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>In Absence</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>The storm that snapped our fate’s one ship in twain
<dt>Hath blown my half o’ the wreck from thine apart.
<dt>O Love! O Love! across the gray-waved main
<dt>To thee-ward strain my eyes, my arms, my heart.
<dt>I ask my God if e’en in His sweet place,
<dt>Where, by one waving of a wistful wing,
<dt>My soul could straightway tremble face to face
<dt>With thee, with thee, across the stellar ring--
<dt>Yea, where thine absence I could ne’er bewail
<dt>Longer than lasts that little blank of bliss
<dt>When lips draw back, with recent pressure pale,
<dt>To round and redden for another kiss--
<dt>Would not my lonesome heart still sigh for thee
<dt>What time that drear kiss-intervals must be?
<p>

<p>
<dt>So do the mottled formulas of Sense
<dt>Glide snakewise through our dreams of Aftertime;
<dt>So errors breed in reeds and grasses dense
<dt>That bank our singing rivulets of rhyme.
<dt>By Sense rule Space and Time, but in God’s land
<dt>Their intervals are not, save such as lie
<dt>Betwixt successive tones in concords bland
<dt>Whose loving distance makes the harmony.
<dt>Ah, there shall never come ‘twixt me and thee
<dt>Gross dissonances of the mile, the year;
<dt>But in the multichords of ecstasy
<dt>Our souls shall mingle, yet be featured clear,
<dt>And absence wrought to intervals divine,
<dt>Shall part, yet link, thy nature’s tone in mine.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Look down the shining peaks of all my days
<dt>Base-hidden in the valleys of deep night,
<dt>So shalt thou see the heights and depths of praise
<dt>My love would render unto love’s delight;
<dt>For I would make each day an Alp sublime
<dt>Of passionate snow, white-hot yet icy clear,
<dt>--One crystal of the true-loves of all time
<dt>Spiring the world’s prismatic atmosphere;
<dt>And I would make each night an awful vale
<dt>Deep as thy soul, obscure as modesty,
<dt>With every star in heaven trembling pale
<dt>O’er sweet profounds where only Love can see.
<dt>Oh, runs not thus the lesson thou hast taught?
<dt>When life’s all love, ‘tis life: aught else, ‘tis naught.

<p>
<dt>Let no man say, <i>He at his lady’s feet</i>
<dt><i>Lays worship that to Heaven alone belongs;</i>
<dt><i>Yea, swings the incense that for God is meet</i>
<dt><i>In flippant censers of light lover’s songs.</i>
<dt>Who says it, knows not God, nor love, nor thee;
<dt>For love is large as is yon heavenly dome:
<dt>In love’s great blue, each passion is full free
<dt>To fly his favourite flight and build his home.
<dt>Did e’er a lark with sky-ward pointing beak
<dt>Stab by mischance a level-flying dove?
<dt>Wife-love flies level, his dear mate to seek:
<dt>God-love darts straight into the skies above.
<dt>Crossing the windage of each other’s wings
<dt>But speeds them both upon their journeyings.
<p>

<h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>Now at thy soft recalling voice I rise
<dt>Where thought is lord o’er Time’s complete estate,
<dt>Like as a dove from out the gray sedge flies
<dt>To tree-tops green where coos his heavenly mate.
<dt>From these clear coverts high and cool I see
<dt>How every time with every time is knit,
<dt>And each to all is mortised cunningly,
<dt>And none is sole or whole, yet all are fit.
<dt>Thus, if this Age but as a comma show
<dt>‘Twixt weightier clauses of large-worded years,
<dt>My calmer soul scorns not the mark: I know
<dt>This crooked point Time’s complex sentence clears.
<dt>Yet more I learn while, Friend! I sit by thee;
<dt>Who sees all time, sees all eternity.
<p>
<a name=201></a><h3>II</h3><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>By the more height of thy sweet stature grown,
<dt>Twice-eyed with thy gray vision set in mine,
<dt>I ken far lands to wifeless men unknown,
<dt>I compass stars for one-sexed eyes too fine.
<dt>No text on sea-horizons cloudily writ,
<dt>No maxim vaguely starred in fields or skies,
<dt>But this wise thou-in-me deciphers it:
<dt>Oh, thou’rt the Height of heights, the Eye of eyes.
<dt>Not hardest fortune’s most unbounded stress
<dt>Can bind my soul nor hurl it from on high,
<dt>Possessing thee, the self of loftiness,
<dt>And very light that sight discovers by.
<dt>Howe’er thou turn’st, wrong Earth! still Love’s in sight
<dt>For we are taller than the breadth of night.
