<a name="050"></a><h2>England</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>While men pay reverence to mighty things,
<dt>They must revere thee, thou blue-cinctured isle
<dt>Of England—not to-day, but this long while
<dt>In front of nations, Mother of great kings,
<dt>Soldiers, and poets. Round thee the sea flings
<dt>His steel-bright arm, and shields thee from the guile
<dt>And hurt of France. Secure, with august smile,
<dt>Thou sittest, and the East its tribute brings.
<dt>Some say thy old-time power is on the wane,
<dt>Thy moon of grandeur, filled, contracts at length—
<dt>They see it darkening down from less to less.
<dt>Let but a hostile hand make threat again,
<dt>And they shall see thee in thy ancient strength,
<dt>Each iron sinew quivering, lioness!
<p>
<a name="075"></a><h2>Egypt</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Fantastic Sleep is busy with my eyes:
<dt>I seem in some waste solitude to stand
<dt>Once ruled of Cheops: upon either hand
<dt>A dark illimitable desert lies,
<dt>Sultry and still—a realm of mysteries;
<dt>A wide-browed Sphinx, half-buried in the sand,
<dt>With orbless sockets stares across the land,
<dt>The woefulest thing beneath these brooding skies,
<dt>Where all is woeful, weird-lit vacancy.
<dt>'Tis neither midnight, twilight, nor moonrise.
<dt>Lo! while I gaze, beyond the vast sand sea
<dt>The nebulous clouds are downward slowly drawn,
<dt>And one bleared star, faint-glimmering like a bee,
<dt>Is shut in the rosy outstretched hand of Dawn.
<p>(See Shelley's <a href="shelley.htm#100">Ozymandius</a>.)
<p>
<a name="100"></a><h2>Enamoured Architect of Airy Rhyme</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Enamoured architect of airy rhyme,
<dt>Build as thou wilt; heed not what each man says.
<dt>Good souls, but innocent of dreamers' ways,
<dt>Will come, and marvel why thou wastest time;
<dt>Others, beholding how thy turrets climb
<dt>'Twixt theirs and heaven, will hate thee all their days;
<dt>But most beware of those who come to praise.
<dt>O Wondersmith, O worker in sublime
<dt>And heaven-sent dreams, let art be all in all;
<dt>Build as thou wilt, unspoiled by praise or blame,
<dt>Build as thou wilt, and as thy light is given;
<dt>Then, if at last the airy structure fall,
<dt>Dissolve, and vanish—take thyself no shame.
<dt>They fail, and they alone, who have not striven.
<p>
<a name="150"></a><h2>Miracles</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Sick of myself and all that keeps the light
<dt>Of the blue skies away from me and mine,
<dt>I climb this ledge, and by this wind-swept pine
<dt>Lingering, watch the coming of the night.
<dt>'Tis ever a new wonder to my sight.
<dt>Men look to God for some mysterious sign,
<dt>For other stars than those that nightly shine,
<dt>For some unnatural symbol of His might:—
<dt>Would'st see a miracle as grand as those
<dt>The prophets wrought of old in Palestine?
<dt>Come watch with me the shaft of fire that glows
<dt>In yonder West; the fair, frail palaces,
<dt>The fading alps and archipelagoes,
<dt>And great cloud-continents of sunset-seas.
<p>
<a name="151"></a><h2>Fredericksburg</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>The increasing moonlight drifts across my bed,
<dt>And on the churchyard by the road, I know,
<dt>It falls as white and noiselessly as snow.
<dt>'Twas such a night two weary summers fled;
<dt>The stars, as now, were waning overhead.
<dt>Listen! Again the shrill-lipped bugles blow
<dt>Where the swift currents of the river flow
<dt>Past Fredericksburg,—far off the heavens are red
<dt>With sudden conflagration: on yon height,
<dt>Linstock in hand, the gunners hold their breath:
<dt>A signal-rocket pierces the dense night,
<dt>Flings its spent stars upon the town beneath:
<dt>Hark!—the artillery massing on the right;
<dt>Hark!—the black squadrons wheeling down to Death!
<p>
<a name="160"></a><h2>"Even This Will Pass Away"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Touched with the delicate green of early May,
<dt>Or later, when the rose unveils her face,
<dt>The world hangs glittering in star-strown space,
<dt>Fresh as a jewel found but yesterday.
<dt>And yet 'tis very old; what tongue may say
<dt>How old it is? Race follows upon race,
<dt>Forgetting and forgotten; in their place
<dt>Sink tower and temple; nothing long may stay.
<dt>We build on tombs, and live our day, and die;
<dt>From out our dust new towers and temples start;
<dt>Our very name becomes a mystery.
<dt>What cities no man ever heard of lie
<dt>Under the glacier, in the mountain's heart,
<dt>In violet glooms beneath the moaning sea!
<p>
<a name="170"></a><h2>Pursuit and Possession</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>When I behold what pleasure is Pursuit,
<dt>What life, what glorious eagerness, it is;
<dt>Then mark how full Possession falls from this,
<dt>How fairer seems the blossom than the fruit,—
<dt>I am perplexed, and often stricken mute,
<dt>Wondering which attained the higher bliss,
<dt>The wingéd insect, or the chrysalis
<dt>It thrust aside with unreluctant foot.
<dt>Spirit of verse, which still eludes my art,
<dt>You shapes of loveliness that still do haunt me,
<dt>O never, never rest upon my heart,
<dt>If when I have thee I shall little want thee!
<dt>Still flit away in moonlight, rain, and dew,
<dt>Will-o'-the-wisp, that I may still pursue!
<p>(See Shakespeare's <a href="shakespeare.htm#129">Sonnet 129</a>.)</p>
<p>       
    
<h2><a name="sleep"></a>Sleep</h2><dl>
<dt>When to soft Sleep we give ourselves away, 
  
<dt>And in a dream as in a fairy bark
  
<dt>Drift on and on through the enchanted dark
  
<dt>To purple daybreak, little thought we pay
  
<dt>To that sweet, bitter world we know by day.
  
<dt>We are clean quit of it, as is a lark
  
<dt>So high in heaven no human eye may mark
  
<dt>The thin swift pinion cleaving through the gray.
  
<dt>
  
<dt>Till we awake ill fate can do no ill,
  
<dt>The resting heart shall not take up again
  
<dt>The heavy load that yet must make it bleed;
  
<dt>For this brief space the loud world's voice is still,
  
<dt>No faintest echo of it brings us pain.
  
<dt>How will it be when we shall sleep indeed?</dt></dl>
<h2><a name="three"></a>Three Flowers</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Herewith I send you three pressed withered flowers:
  <dt>This one was white, with golden star; this, blue
  <dt>As&nbsp;Capri's wave; that, purple and shot through
  <dt>With sunset-orange.&nbsp; Where the Duomo towers
  <dt>In diamond air, and under hanging bowers
  <dt>The&nbsp;Arno glides, this faded violet grew
  <dt>On Landors grave; from Landor's heart it drew
  <dt>Its magic azure in the long spring hours.
  <dt>
  <dt>Within the shadow of the Pyrimid
  <dt>Of Caius Cestius was the daisy found,
  <dt>White as&nbsp;the soul of Keats in Paradise.
  <dt>The pansy,—there were hundreds of them, hid
  <dt>In the thick grass that folded Shelley's mound,
  <dt> Guarding his ashes with most lovely eyes.</dt></dl>       
  <h2><a name="invita"></a>      Invita Minerva</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Not of Desire alone is music born,
  <dt>Not till the Muse&nbsp;wills is our passion crowned;
  <dt>Unsought she comes; if sought but seldom found,
  <dt>Repaying thus our longing with her scorn.
  <dt>Hence is it poets often are forlorn,
  <dt>In super-subtle chains of silence bound,
  <dt>And mid the crowds that compass them around
  <dt>Still dwell in isolation night and morn,
  <dt>With&nbsp;knitted brow and cheek all passion-pale
  <dt>Showing the baffled purpose of the mind.
  <dt>Hence is it I, that find no prayers avail
  <dt>To move my Lyric Mistress to be kind,
  <dt>Have stolen away into this leafy dale,
  <dt>Drawn by the flutings of the silvery wind.</dt>
  </dl>
  <h2><a name="thorwaldsen"></a>      Thorwaldsen</h2>
  <dt>Not in the fabled influence of some star,
  <dt>Benign or evil, do our fortunes lie:
  <dt>We are the arbiters of destiny,
  <dt>Lords of the life we either make or mar.
  <dt>We are our own impediment and bar
  <dt>To noble issues.&nbsp; With averted eye
  <dt>We let the golden moment pass us by,
  <dt>Time's foolish spendthrifts, searching wide and far
  <dt>For what lies close at hand.&nbsp; To serve our turn
  <dt>We ask fair wind and favorable tide.
  <dt>From the dead Danish sculptor let us learn
  <dt>To make Occasion, not to be denied:
  <dt>Against the sheer precipitous mountainside
  <dt>Thorwaldsen carved his&nbsp;Lion at Lucerne.
  <p>
<h2><a name="outward"></a>Outward Bound</h2>
  <dt>I leave behind me the elm-shadowed square
  <dt>And&nbsp;carven&nbsp;portals of the silent street,
  <dt>And wander on with listless, vagrant feet
  <dt>Through seaward-leading alleys, till the air
  <dt>Smells of the sea, and straightway then the care
  <dt>Slips from my heart, and life once more is sweet.
  <dt>At the lane's ending lie the white-winged fleet.
  <dt>O restless Fancy, whither wouldst thou fare?
  <dt>Here are brave pinions that shall take thee far—
  <dt>Gaunt hulks of Norway; ships of red Ceylon;
  <dt> Slim-masted lovers of the blue Azores!
  <dt>'Tis but an instant hence to Zanzibar,
  <dt>Or to the regions of the Midnight Sun:
  <dt>Ionian isles are thine, and all the fairy shores!
  <dt>
<h2><a name="books"></a>Books and Seasons</h2>      
  <dt>Because the sky is blue; because blithe May
  <dt>Masks in the wren's note and the lilac's hue;
  <dt>Because—in fine, because the sky is blue
  <dt>I will read none but piteous tales to-day.
  <dt>Keep happy laughter till the skies be gray,
  <dt>And the sad season cypress wears, and rue;
  <dt>Then, when the wind is moaning in the flue,
  <dt>And ways are dark, bid Chaucer make us gay.
  <dt>But now a little sadness!&nbsp; All too sweet
  <dt>This springtide riot, this most poignant air,
  <dt>This sensuous sphere of color and perfume!
  <dt>So listen, love, while I the woes repeat
  <dt>Of Hamlet and Ophelia, and that pair
  <dt>Whose bridal bed was builded in a tomb.
  <dt>
<h2><a name="andromeda"></a>Andromeda</h2>      
  <dt>The smooth-worn coin and threadbare classic phrase
  <dt>Of Grecian myths that did beguile my youth,
  <dt>Beguile me not as in the olden days:
  <dt>I think more grief and beauty dwell with truth.
  <dt> Andromeda, in fetters by the sea,
  <dt>Star-pale with anguish till young Perseus came,
  <dt>Less moves me with her suffering than she,
  <dt>The slim girl figure fettered to dark shame,
  <dt>That nightly haunts the park, there, like a shade,
  <dt>Trailing her wretchedness from street to street.
  <dt>See where she passes—neither wife nor maid.
  <dt>How all mere fiction crumbles at her feet!
  <dt>Here is woe's self, and not the mask of woe:
  <dt>A legend's shadow shall not move you so!
  <dt>
<h2><a name="vex"></a>"I vex me not with brooding on the years"</h2>      
  <dt>I vex me not with brooding on the years
  <dt>That were ere I drew breath:&nbsp; why should I then
  <dt>Distrust the darkness that may fall again
  <dt>When life is done?&nbsp; Perchance in other spheres—
  <dt> Dead planets—I once tasted mortal tears,
  <dt>And walked as now among a throng of men,
  <dt>Pondering things that lay beyond my ken,
  <dt> Questioning death, and solacing my fears.
  <dt>Oftimes indeed strange sense have I of this,
  <dt>Vague memories that hold me with a spell,
  <dt>Touches of unseen lips upon my brow,
  <dt>   Breathing some incommunicable bliss!
  <dt>In years foregone, O Soul, was all not well?
  <dt>Still lovelier life awaits thee.&nbsp; Fear not thou!
  <dt>
<h2><a name="reminiscence"></a>Reminiscence</h2>      
  <dt>Though I am native to this frozen zone
  <dt>That half the twelvemonth torpid lies, or dead;
  <dt> Though the cold azure arching overhead
  <dt>  And the Atlantic's never-ending moan
  <dt>Are mine by heritage, I must have known
  <dt>Life otherwhere in epochs long since fled;
  <dt>For in my veins some Orient blood is red,
  <dt>And through my thought are lotus blossoms blown.
  <dt>I do remember. . . it was just at dusk,
  <dt>Near a walled garden at the river's turn
  <dt> (A thousand summers seem but yesterday!)
  <dt>A Nubian girl, more sweet than Khorja musk,
  <dt>Came to the water-tank to fill her urn,
  <dt>And, with the urn, she bore my heart away!
