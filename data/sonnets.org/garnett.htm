<dt>I will not rail or grieve when torpid eld
<dt>Frosts the slow-journeying blood, for I shall see
<dt>The lovelier leaves hang yellow on the tree,
<dt>The nimbler brooks in icy fetters held.
<dt>Methinks the aged eye that first beheld
<dt>Pale Autumn in her waning pageantry,
<dt>Then knew himself, dear Nature, child of thee,
<dt>Marking the common doom, that all compelled.
<dt>No kindred we to thy belov&egrave;d brods,
<dt>If, dying these, we drew a selfish breath;
<dt>But one path travel all their multitudes,
<dt>And none dispute the solemn voice that saith:
<dt>"Sun to thy setting; to your autumn, woods;
<dt>Stream to thy sea; and man unto thy death!"
<p>

<p>
<dt>This little light is not a little sign
<dt>Of duteous service innocent of blame,
<dt>Contented with obscurity till came
<dt>Mandate that as a star her beam should shine.
<dt>On sickness did she wait, or scribe, or shrine,
<dt>The law of her beneficence the same,
<dt>Somewhat to sunder from her fragile frame,
<dt>Something of her own being to resign.
<dt>So wasted now, that, let the lustre be
<dt>Resummoned but once more, the fuel dies;
<dt>Yet virtues six dorn her brevity,
<dt>Singly too seldom met of mortal eyes;
<dt>Discretion, faithfulness, frugality,
<dt>Purity, vigilance, self-sacrifice.

<p>
<dt>I saw the youthful singers of my day
<dt>To sound of lutes and lyres in morning hours
<dt>Trampling with eager feet the teeming flowers,
<dt>Bound for Fame's temple upon Music's way:
<dt>A happy band, a folk of holiday:
<dt>But some lay down and slept among the bowers;
<dt>Some turned aside to fanes of alien Powers;
<dt>Some Death took by the hand and led away.
<dt>Now gathering twilight clouds the land with grey,
<dt>Yet, where last light is lit, last pilgrims go,
<dt>Outlined in gliding shade by dying glow,
<dt>And fain with weary fortitude essay
<dt>The last ascent. The end is hid, but they
<dt>Who follow on my step shall surely know.

<p>
<dt>Poet, whose unscarr'd feet have trodden Hell,
<dt>By what grim path and dread environing
<dt>Of fire couldst thou that dauntless footstep bring
<dt>And plant it firm amid the dolorous cell
<dt>Of darkness where perpetually dwell
<dt>The spirits cursed beyond imagining?
<dt>Or else is thine a visionary wing,
<dt>And all thy terror but a tale to tell?
<dt>Neither and both, thou seeker! I have been
<dt>No wilder path than thou thyself dost go,
<dt>Close mask'd in an impenetrable screen,
<dt>Which having rent I gaze around, and know
<dt>What tragic wastes of gloom, before unseen,
<dt>Curtain the soul that strives and sins below.
