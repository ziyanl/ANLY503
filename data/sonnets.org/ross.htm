<p>
<dt>I heard Old Ocean raise her voice and cry,
<dt>In that still hour between the night and day;
<dt>I saw the answering tides, green robed and gray,
<dt>Turn to her with a low contented sigh;
<dt>Marching with silent feet they passed me by,
<dt>For the white moon had taught them to obey,
<dt>And scarce a wavelet broke in fretful spray,
<dt>As they went forth to kiss the stooping sky.
<p>
<dt>So, to my heart, when the last sunray sleeps,
<dt>And the wan night, impatient for the moon,
<dt>Throws her gray mantle over land and sea,
<dt>There comes a call from out Life's nether deeps,
<dt>And tides, like some old ocean in a swoon,
<dt>Flow out, in soundless majesty, to thee.  
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Watch on Deck</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Becalmed upon the equatorial seas,
<dt>A ship of gold lay on a sea of fire;
<dt>Each sail and rope and spar, as in desire,
<dt>Mutely besought the kisses of a breeze;
<dt>Low laughter told the mariners at ease;
<dt>Sweet sea-songs hymned the red sun's fun'ral pyre:
<dt>Yet One, with eyes that never seemed to tire,
<dt>Watched for the storm, nursed on the thunder's knees.
<p>
<dt>Thou watcher of the spirit's inner keep,
<dt>Scanning Death's lone, illimitable deep,
<dt>Spread outward to the far immortal shore!
<dt>While the vault sleeps, from the upheaving deck,
<dt>Thou see'st the adamantine reefs that wreck,
<dt>And Life's low shoals, where lusting billows roar.  
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Autumn</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When, with low moanings on the distant shore,
<dt>Like vain regrets, the ocean-tide is rolled:
<dt>When, thro' bare boughs, the tale of death is told
<dt>By breezes sighing, "Summer days are o'er";
<dt>When all the days we loved -- the days of yore --
<dt>Lie in their vaults, dead Kings who ruled of old --
<dt>Unrobed and sceptreless, uncrowned with gold,
<dt>Conquered, and to be crowned, ah! never more.
<p>
<dt>If o'er the bare fields, cold and whitening
<dt>With the first snow-flakes, I should see thy form,
<dt>And meet and kiss thee, that were enough of Spring;
<dt>Enough of sunshine, could I feel the warm
<dt>Glad beating of thy heart 'neath Winter's wing,
<dt>Tho' Earth were full of whirlwind and of storm.
