<p>
<dt>What ruined shapes of feudal pomp are there,
<dt>In the cold moonlight fading silently?
<dt>The castle, with its stern, baronial air,
<dt>Still frowning, as accustomed to defy;
<dt>The Gothic street, where Desmond's chivalry
<dt>Dwelt in their pride; the cloistered house of prayer;
<dt>The gate-towers, mouldering where the stream moans by,
<dt>Now, but the owl's lone haunt, and fox's lair.
<dt>Here once the pride of princely Desmond flushed;
<dt>His courtiers knelt, his mailed squadrons rushed;
<dt>And saintly brethren poured the choral strain:
<dt>Here Beauty bowed her head, and smiled and blushed:--
<dt>Ah, of these glories what doth now remain?
<dt>The charnel of yon desecrated fane!
</p>
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>Castleconnell</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Broad, but not deep, along his rock-chafed bed,
<dt>In many a sparkling eddy winds the flood.
<dt>Clasped by a margin of green underwood:
<dt>A castled crag, with ivy garlanded,
<dt>Sheer, o'er the torrent frowns: above the mead
<dt>De Burgho's towers, crumbling o'er many a rood,
<dt>Stand gauntly out in airy solitude
<dt>Backed by yon furrowed mountain's tinted head.
<dt>Sounds of far people, mingling with the fall
<dt>Of waters, and the busy hum of bees,
<dt>And larks in air, and throstles in the trees,
<dt>Thrill the moist air with murmurs musical.
<dt>While cottage smoke goes drifting on the breeze,
<dt>And sunny clouds are floating over all.
</p>
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>The Rock of Cashel</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Royal and saintly Cashel! I would gaze
<dt>Upon the wreck of thy departed powers,
<dt>Not in the dewy light of matin hours,
<dt>Nor the meridian pomp of summer's blaze,
<dt>But at the close of dim autumnal days,
<dt>When the sun's parting glance, through slanting showers,
<dt>Sheds o'er thy rock-throned battlements and towers
<dt>Such awful gleams as brighten o'er Decay's
<dt>Prophetic cheek. At such a time, methinks,
<dt>There breathes from thy lone courts and voiceless aisles
<dt>A melancholy moral, such as sinks
<dt>On the lone traveller's heart, amid the piles
<dt>Of vast Persepolis on her mountain stand,
<dt>Or Thebes half buried in the desert sand.
</p>

<p>
<dt>Gazing from each low bulwark of this bridge,
<dt>How wonderful the contrast!  Dark as night,
<dt>Here, amid cliffs and woods, with headlong might,
<dt>The black stream whirls, through ferns and drooping sedge,
<dt>'Neath twisted roots moss-brown, and weedy ledge,
<dt>Gushing. Aloft, from yonder birch-clad height,
<dt>Leaps into air a cataract, snow-white
<dt>Falling to gulfs obscure. The mountain ridge,
<dt>Like a gray Warder, guardian of the scene,
<dt>Above the cloven gorge gloomily towers.
<dt>O'er the dim woods a gathering tempest lowers
<dt>Save where athwart the moist leaves' lucid green
<dt>A sunbeam, glancing through disparted showers,
<dt>Sparkles along the rill with diamond sheen.
<p>
<dt>A sun-burst on the bay! Turn and behold!
<dt>The restless waves, resplendent in their glory,
<dt>Sweep glittering past yon purpled promontory,
<dt>Bright as Apollo's breastplate.  Bathed in gold,
<dt>Yon bastioned islet gleams. Thin mists are rolled,
<dt>Translucent, through each glen. A mantle hoary
<dt>Veils those peaked hills, shapely as e'er in story
<dt>Delphic, or Alpine, or Vesuvian old,
<dt>Minstrels have sung. From rock and headland proud
<dt>The wild wood spreads its arms around the bay:
<dt>The manifold mountain cones, now dark, now bright,
<dt>Now seen, now lost, alternate from rich light
<dt>To spectral shade; and each dissolving cloud
<dt>Reveals new mountains as it floats away.
