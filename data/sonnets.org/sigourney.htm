<h2>To the Evening Primrose</h2>
<p>
<dt>Pale Primrose! lingering for the evening star
<dt>To bless thee with its beam,--like some fair child
<dt>Who, ere he rests on Morpheus' downy car,
<dt>Doth wait his mother's blessing, pure and mild,
<dt>To hallow his gay dream. His red lips breathe
<dt>The prompted prayer, fast by that parent's knee,
<dt>Even as thou rear'st thy sweetly fragrant wreath
<dt>To matron Evening, while she smiles on thee.
<dt>Go to thy rest, pale flower! the star hath shed
<dt>His benison upon thy bosom fair,
<dt>The dews of summer bathe thy pensive head,
<dt>And weary man forgets his daily care;--
<dt>Sleep on, my rose! till morning gilds the sky
<dt>And bright Aurora's kiss unseal thy trembling eye.
