<p>
<dt>If love should count you worthy, and should deign
<dt>One day to seek your door and be your guest,
<dt>Pause! ere you draw the bolt and bid him rest,
<dt>If in your old content you would remain.
<dt>For not alone he enters: in his train
<dt>Are angels of the mists, the lonely quest,
<dt>Dreams of the unfulfilled and unpossessed.
<dt>And sorrow, and life's immemorial pain.
<dt>He wakes desires you never may forget,
<dt>He shows you stars you never saw before,
<dt>He makes you share with him for evermore,
<dt>The burden of the world's divine regret
<dt>How wise were you to open not!--and yet,
<dt>How poor if you should turn him from the door.
