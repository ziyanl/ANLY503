<p>
<dt>I must not think of thee; and, tired yet strong,
<dt>I shun the thought that lurks in all delight--
<dt>The thought of thee--and in the blue Heaven's height,
<dt>And in the sweetest passage of a song.
<dt>Oh, just beyond the fairest thoughts that throng
<dt>This breast, the thought of thee waits, hidden yet bright;
<dt>But it must never, never come in sight;
<dt>I must stop short of thee the whole day long.
<dt>But when sleep comes to close each difficult day,
<dt>When night gives pause to the long watch I keep,
<dt>And all my bonds I needs must loose apart,
<dt>Must doff my will as raiment laid away,--
<dt>With the first dream that comes with the first sleep
<dt>I run, I run, I am gathered to thy heart.

<p>
<dt>A poet of one mood in all my lays,
<dt>Ranging all life to sing one only love,
<dt>Like a west wind across the world I move,
<dt>Sweeping my harp of floods mine own wild ways.
<dt>The countries change, but not the westwind days
<dt>Which are my songs. My soft skies shine above,
<dt>And on all seas the colors of a dove,
<dt>And on all fields a flash of silver greys.
<dt>I make the whole world answer to my art
<dt>And sweet monotonous meanings. In your ears
<dt>I change not ever, bearing, for my part,
<dt>One thought that is the treasure of my years,
<dt>A small cloud full of rain upon my heart
<dt>And in mine arms, clasped, like a child in tears.
