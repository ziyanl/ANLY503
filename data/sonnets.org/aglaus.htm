<p>
<dt>Fate! seek me out some lake far off and lone,
<dt>Shut in by hills of green and gradual rise,
<dt>And beautified with blue inverted skies--
<dt>Where not a breeze but comes with softened tone.
<dt>And if the waves awake, they only moan
<dt>With a low lulling music, like the rills
<dt>That make their home among those happy hills;
<dt>And let me find--left there by hands unknown--
<dt>A bark with mouldering sides and rifted sail,
<dt>Just strong enough to bear me from the shore,
<dt>But not to reach its tree-girt harbour more--
<dt>Oh, happy, happy rest! oh, world of wail!
<dt>How calmly I would tempt the peaceful deep,
<dt>And sink to death, as if I sank to sleep.
