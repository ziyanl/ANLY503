<p>
<dt>O crimson-hearted, flower-producing June--
<dt>Dear month of love, and laughter, and light song!
<dt>Wherein our mother brings her choral throng
<dt>To hymn the hymns that sweetest are in tune:
<dt>Wherein all gaily goes gave soul of wrong
<dt>That takes to bed quite blinded by the light
<dt>Of that sweet, sober, gentle queen of night
<dt>That rules the tides of earth and men--the moon;
<dt>I love you! for it was beneath your skies
<dt>I first looked Love into her starry eyes;
<dt>I love you! for beneath your dome of blue
<dt>I heard her answer--"And I love you too!"
<dt>I hate you!--'mid your flowers it was my lot
<dt>To hear those same lips say--"I love you not!"
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Wisdom</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Wisdom immortal from immortal Jove
<dt>Shadows more beauty with her virgin brows
<dt>Than is between the virgin breasts of Love
<dt>Who makes at will and breaks her random vows,
<dt>And hath a name all earthly names above:
<dt>The noblest are her offspring; she controls
<dt>The time and seasons--yea, all things that are--
<dt>The heads and hands of men, their hearts and souls,
<dt>And all that moves upon our mother star,
<dt>And all that pauses 'twixt the peaceful poles.
<dt>Nor is she dark and distant, coy and cold--
<dt>But all in all to all who seek her shrine
<dt>In utter truth, like to that king of old
<dt>Who wooed and won--yet by no right divine.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Anticipation</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Anticipation is the oil that feeds
<dt>The flame of life. It is the Siren fair
<dt>That sings at twilight in the hollow reeds,
<dt>And drowns the moaning discord of despair.
<dt>Nay, now in darkest night it comes to me,--
<dt>It dulls the edge of every present care:
<dt>Blots from the tablets of the memory
<dt>What hath been ill, or <i>is</i>, inscribing there
<dt>In golden letters that which yet may be
<dt>Of earth's good things my individual share.
<dt>And should the days be drearier in age,
<dt>And disappointment part of mine estate,
<dt>With fortune I shall not a warfare wage,
<dt>But sing my song as now,--as now anticipate.
