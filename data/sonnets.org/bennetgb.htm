<p>
<dt>He came in silvern armour, trimmed with black--
<dt>A lover come from legends long ago--
<dt>With silver spurs and silken plumes a-blow,
<dt>And flashing sword caught fast and buckled back
<dt>In a carven sheath of Tamarack.
<dt>He came with footsteps beautifully slow,
<dt>And spoke in voice meticulously low.
<dt>He came and Romance followed in his track . .
<p>
<dt>I did not ask his name--I thought him Love;
<dt>I did not care to see his hidden face.
<dt>All life seemed born in my intaken breath;
<dt>All thought seemed flown like some forgotten dove.
<dt>He bent to kiss and raised his visor's lace . . .
<dt>All eager-lipped I kissed the mouth of Death.
<p>
<a name=002></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>Some things are very dear to me--
<dt>Such things as flowers bathed by rain
<dt>Or patterns traced upon the sea
<dt>Or crocuses where snow has lain . . .
<dt>The iridescence of a gem,
<dt>The moon's cool opalescent light,
<dt>Azaleas and the scent of them,
<dt>And honeysuckles in the night.
<dt>And many sounds are also dear--
<dt>Like winds that sing among the trees
<dt>Or crickets calling from the weir
<dt>Or Negroes humming melodies.
<dt>But dearer far than all surmise
<dt>Are sudden tear-drops in your eyes.
