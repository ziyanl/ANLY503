<dt>Spring, summer, autumn! priestesses that hold
<dt>Alternate watch at nature's altar! Deep
<dt>And full of mystery the course ye keep
<dt>In hidden sympathy. First, chastely cold,
<dt>Thou, vestal spring, most gently dost unfold
<dt>The oracles of nature, and from sleep
<dt>Enchanted bid her infant beauties peep.
<dt>Thou, summer, dost inscribe in living gold
<dt>The fullness of each promise sibylline,
<dt>And makest in part the bright fruition thine,
<dt>Murmuring soft music from her leafy fane:
<dt>Till autumn's stores reveal in corn and wine
<dt>The meaning shut in every bud and grain.
<dt>Then comes the solemn pause which calls spring back again.

<p>
<dt>Now day survives the sun. The pale grey skies
<dt>A sort of dull and dubious lustre keep
<dt>As with their own light shining. Nature lies
<dt>Slumbering, and gazing on me in her sleep,
<dt>So still, so mute, with fixed and soul-less eyes.
<dt>The sun is set, yet not a star is seen:
<dt>Distinct the landscape, save where intervene
<dt>The creeping mists that from the dark stream rise;
<dt>Now spread into a sea with islets broken,
<dt>And woodland points, now poised on the thin air:
<dt>In the black west the clouds a storm betoken
<dt>And all things seem a spectral gloom to wear.
<dt>The cautious bat resents the lingering light,
<dt>And the long-folded sheep wonder it is not night.
<p>

<p>
<dt>There is, I think, no sunshine like the sky
<dt>Of those mild, breezy, cloudless autumn days
<dt>Which tempt once more abroad the butterfly
<dt>To search for lingering flowers; when the green sprays
<dt>Of ash, now loosened, drop on him who strays
<dt>Through woodland paths, while the light yellow leaves
<dt>Of fading trees come dancing down all ways
<dt>Like wing&eacute;d things; and oft the stream receives
<dt>Full many a tiny voyager, whirled along
<dt>Amid its eddies;--when the gossamer spreads
<dt>Over the fresh clods her trembling silvery threads;
<dt>And robin, thinly screened, his sweetest song
<dt>Pours forth as if triumphant over the scene,
<dt>He said, "Spring will return, and all again be green."
