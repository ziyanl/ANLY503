<h2>The Scarlet Pimpernel</h2>
<p>
<dt>O have you seen the scarlet pimpernel,
<dt>The wild, sea-flavored blossom of the strand,
<dt>The token flower, the pledge of sea and land,
<dt>And have you learned to heed its secret spell?
<dt>Aurora's friend, it loves the morning well,
<dt>And you shall find it open to your hand
<dt>The sunny morning through,—but understand
<dt>Storm clouds will close it closer than a shell.
<dt>        
<dt>Love is the pimpernel:&nbsp; then do not wait;
<dt>Go in the morning, faithful to the hour,
<dt> Go when thy lady keeps her matin state;
<dt>Her heart is coy, and closes like a flower.
<dt>Go in the sunlight, haste and claim love's boon,
<dt>   Nor tempt the changing skies and afternoon.
<dt>
