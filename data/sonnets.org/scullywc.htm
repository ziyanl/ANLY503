<a name=010></a><h2>Good and Evil</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Methought I saw an angel on the sun
<dt>Sit thron&eacute;d, whilst around the planets swayed,
<dt>Each with its guiding spirit, that obeyed
<dt>In duteous wise that lofty-visaged one;
<dt>But on this earth it seemed two spirits fought
<dt>A deadly combat, struggling hand to hand--
<dt>The G<font size="-1">OOD</font> and E<font size="-1">VIL</font>, over sea and land
<dt>Locked in a strife with dreadful issues fraught.
<dt>For as the calm-eyed ruler of each sphere
<dt>Bore slowly past the battle-riven world,
<dt>Firm in his mighty hand he held a spear
<dt>Poised o'er his head, and ready to be hurled--
<dt>To dash this globe to fragments as it whirled,
<dt>Should Evil's brow the wreath of victory wear.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>I Leant My Breast</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I Leant my breast against the golden gate
<dt>That bars the body from the land of dreams,
<dt>But lets the soul to roam in lawns where wait,
<dt>Or wander down the banks of shining streams,
<dt>The dead and living, holding strange debate
<dt>Of things that yet should happen 'neath the beams
<dt>Of suns as yet unrisen, whilst listless Fate
<dt>Paused, and the stars unyoked their tired teams.
<p>
<dt>And as my hand the latch sought, for I fain
<dt>Had followed one who bore a white rose-wreath,
<dt>Sleep touched mine eyes with darkness, and the pain
<dt>Of longing ceased; and when I next drew breath
<dt>I heard a voice low whisper, "It is vain
<dt>To enter here--thou first must drink of death!"
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Namaqualand</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A land of deathful sleep, where fitful dreams
<dt>Of hurrying spring scarce wake swift fading flowers;
<dt>A land of fleckless sky, and sheer-shed beams
<dt>Of sun and stars through day's and dark's slow hours,
<dt>A land where sand has choked once fluent streams--
<dt>Where grassless plains lie girt by granite towers
<dt>That fright the swift and heaven-nurtured teams
<dt>Of winds that bear afar the sea-gleaned showers.
<dt>The wild Atlantic, fretted by the breath
<dt>Of fiery gales o'er leagues of desert sped,
<dt>Rolls back, and wreaks in surf its thunderous wrath
<dt>On rocks that down the wan, wide shore are spread;
<dt>The waves for ever roar a song of death,
<dt>The shore they roar to is for ever dead.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Prayer</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Talk not of prayers that fail; the prayers unheard
<dt>Are not the askings Paul meant when he said:
<dt>"Pray without ceasing." Be thou well assured,
<dt>The true petition, not of barren word,
<dt>But plumed of deed, scales Heaven overhead,
<dt>Where souls and suns from God's high throne are shed.
<dt>Pray without ceasing, let good deeds unfold
<dt>Like petals of a rose, until, complete,
<dt>The flower of asking, full and fair and sweet,
<dt>Is fit for God's right hand to take and hold.
<dt>False prayers are barren breath, like vapour rolled
<dt>Between men and the stars; they hide the feet
<dt>Of angels. But the true prayer, wise and meet,
<dt>From chiming sphere to sphere on high is told.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Immanuel Kant</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A mountain sometimes stands in silent state
<dt>And outward stillness, whilst its fiery heart
<dt>Throbs with doom's potency and pent-up fate.
<dt>So K<font size="-1">ANT</font> stood, brooding for twelve years apart
<dt>From men, whilst his strong soul did dominate
<dt>Amid the shades whose realm was its resort.
<dt>Then on the mind's illimitable sea
<dt>He sailed, undaunted, till he found an isle
<dt>Where Truth sat, like a Sybil, 'neath a tree
<dt>Whose fruit was knowledge, and he felt her smile
<dt>Smite on the veils of sense that utterly
<dt>Cloud the soul's eyes and so sad men beguile.
<dt>And in his trembling hand she laid the key
<dt>That solves the secrets of all things that be.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>The Choice</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How often is it that our onward path
<dt>Divides in twain, whilst, at the junction, stand
<dt>Two fates, and each a garland proffereth,
<dt>Of buds of promise twined, with outstretched hand.
<dt>The one is Duty called, her visage hath
<dt>The clearer light, and of her promised land
<dt>She tells high tidings, whilst, with stern command,
<dt>She points to roads that lead, perchance, to death!
<dt>The other is more beautiful; her face
<dt>Glows in the sunlight, and her lovelit eyes
<dt>Shew in their limpid wells the deeps of space,
<dt>Star-strewn with hopes, and fairest prophecies.
<dt>Her name is Inclination; but no peace
<dt>Dwells in her smile, nor on her pathway lies.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>Barren Time</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oft would my soul sing, but the heart, her lyre,
<dt>Tear-wet and warped by mine and other's woe,
<dt>Lies in the dust unstrung, whilst flicker slow
<dt>The embers of its faint and fading fire;
<dt>So here I sit and watch the moments flow
<dt>As into past-times' realm the years retire,
<dt>With scant gleaned grain within my hands to show,--
<dt>Scant grain of deed or song, my soul's desire
<dt>If now God's messenger, pale Death, should ask:--
<dt>"What good hast thou to show for these thy years?
<dt>Hast thou made thy life real, or but a masque?"
<dt>What answer could I give? Of which one task,
<dt>By grace whereof men's smiles were lit or tears
<dt>Dried, could I say: "My scroll the record bears?"
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>The Sphinx</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>To all men Nature speaketh in this wise:--
<dt>"Read in my book, or straightway shall ye die;
<dt>Its leaves are open to the readers' eyes;
<dt>Its living lore was thought and written by
<dt>The God whose truths to you are mysteries,
<dt>And in whose hollow hand alike we lie.
<dt>Read in my book and in your reading live;
<dt>I ask ye many questions day by day:
<dt>To those that answer rightly, I will give
<dt>A guerdon rich and full. If one shall say,
<dt>"Alas, I know not!" I may not reprieve;
<dt>If one shall answer wrongly, I must slay;
<dt>I know not mercy, and may not forgive;
<dt>And none can my strong mandate disobey."
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>The Moon</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When I behold the pearl-encinctured moon
<dt>Gaze on the night with seeming ardour warm,
<dt>And mark on hill and dale her soft smiles strewn,
<dt>Till darkness dies before her white wand's charm,
<dt>I feel that what to earth so fair is shewn
<dt>Is false and fleeting as her changing form.
<dt>For in her heart is death; and on her breast
<dt>She bears the impress of her life's decay;
<dt>And that sweet light wherewith her throne is drest,
<dt>Is but the reflex of the quick'ning ray
<dt>Lent by the sun, that fain would see her blest
<dt>With living verdure filling every grey,
<dt>Dead plain and formless mountain's arid crest.
<dt>Yet, cold and dead, she wends through night and day.

<a name=104></a><h3>IV</h3>
<p>
<dt>Love came to me full oft, and shwed his face
<dt>And smiled and fled, Love whispered in the spring--
<dt>Called from his far-off secret dwelling-place--
<dt>And oft before mine eyes his gleaming wing
<dt>Fluttered an instant. Oft so high he sate
<dt>On peaks of snow, that all my breath was gone
<dt>Before I reached him, and dispassionate
<dt>Desire lay dead, and love of Love alone
<dt>My heart held; yet, when Love did farthest seem,
<dt>He silent stood beside me, and his form
<dt>Was veiled; then, as awaking from a dream,
<dt>I knew him suddenly, and, as the storm
<dt>Shrouding the sun may break and disappear,
<dt>The veil was rent, and lo! himself was here.
<p>
<a name=106></a><h3>VI</h3>
<p>
<dt>The sea is as a garden that the wind
<dt>Biddeth break forth in lily-buds, the sky
<dt>A picture with all Fairyland designed--
<dt>By day the clouds, by night the stars sweep by
<dt>Nor question, nor reveal Love's horoscope.
<dt>Life is a maiden with a garland crowned;
<dt>Space is a palace built by hands of Hope;
<dt>Time is a melody that doth resound
<dt>From star to distant star, and only heard
<dt>In passing on its transit from afar.
<dt>Death the inevitable, is deferred
<dt>To such most distant futures, that his car,
<dt>Whose thundering wheels so often sound a-nigh,
<dt>Is silent as his shadow passing by.
<p>
<a name=107></a><h3>VII</h3>
<p>
<dt>Is Love, then, happiness? Ah, yes, the best!
<dt>Is he not pain? Oh, bitter! Doth he smile?
<dt>As smiles the morning? Doth he weep? Yea, lest
<dt>His smile might lose its savour! Hath he guile?
<dt>As hath the red rose that beguiles the bee!
<dt>What doth his voice discourse of? Lo! herein
<dt>Lieth Love's potency; his keen eyes see
<dt>And smite upon each secret-hoarded sin,
<dt>And then he saith: Whilst this with thee doth dwell,
<dt>Must thou and I for ever be at strife,
<dt>And in thine ear my tongue must hourly tell
<dt>Dispraise, till thou dost cast it from thy life?
<dt>And most he raileth at the darling vice
<dt>That doth each soul so cunningly entice.
<p>
<a name=108></a><h3>VIII</h3>
<p>
<dt>Be thou the bow, and, like the arrow, I
<dt>Will cleave the golden apple of endeavour;
<dt>The errant knight of Truth, I'll slay each lie,
<dt>And Error's web with thought's keen sword-blade sever.
<dt>The earth is but a clod, until the sun
<dt>Draw beauty from its breast in tree and flower,
<dt>The years are but a waste of sands that run,
<dt>Till high achievement crown one noble hour.
<dt>The great word's rocky ribs are thinly veined
<dt>With gold, that none but strongest seekers' find,
<dt>And many a combat by the warrior gained
<dt>Before his brow with bays may be entwined.
<dt>Alone, my spirit faints upon the way,
<dt>Be thou its guide, be thou its saving stay.

<p>
<dt>The night is still, the silent frost hangs thick
<dt>On leaf and grass, the jewel's coming day
<dt>Will light to softened splendour. Bright and quick
<dt>The starbeams through the crisp air thrill. Away
<dt>Swifter than these a thought has southward sped,
<dt>And back returned on faithful, homing wing,
<dt>Bearing the picture of a golden head
<dt>Pressed on a snowy pillow. Slumbering
<dt>My darling lies; each eyelid, silken-fringed,
<dt>Droops like a dove's breast-feather tremulously--
<dt>The lips, a petalled casket half unhinged,
<dt>Show pearls more bright than holds the silver sea.
<dt>For now a stray dream-spirit at her ear
<dt>Tells to the child some tale she smiles to hear.
<p>
<a name=118></a><h3>XVIII</h3>
<p>
<dt>A rosebud mouth, sealed fount of words unspoken,
<dt>Thy kiss is as a sacrament. Soft hands
<dt>That hold my heart, each dimple is a token
<dt>Of conquest o'er the Future's widening lands!
<dt>Bright smile, that from the sundawn seems to borrow
<dt>Its rarest light, I dare not even pray
<dt>That thou escape the shades of pain and sorrow,
<dt>For flowers fade in every cloudless day.
<dt>But, when the storm comes, mayst thou find sure haven
<dt>Or strength to stand until its rage hath past,
<dt>And, in the dark, may God's strong help be given,
<dt>Though long the night, the day must come at last,
<dt>And if my own death first be not decreed,
<dt>Oh, may my breast thy shield be, at thy need!
