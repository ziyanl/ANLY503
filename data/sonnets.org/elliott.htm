<a name=001></a><h2>"In these days. . ."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In these days, every mother's son or daughter
<dt>Writes verse, which no one reads except the writer,
<dt>Although, uninked, the paper would be whiter,
<dt>And worth, per ream, a hare, when you have caught her.
<dt>Hundreds of unstaunched Shelleys daily water
<dt>Unanswering dust; a thousand Wordsworths scribble;
<dt>And twice a thousand Corn Law Rhymers dribble
<dt>Rhymed prose, unread.  Hymners of fraud and slaughter,
<dt>By cant called other names, alone find buyers--
<dt>Who buy, but read not. "What a loss in paper,"
<dt>Groans each immortal of the host of sighers!
<dt>"What profanation of the midnight taper
<dt>In expirations vile!  But I write well,
<dt>And wisely print. Why don't my poems sell?"
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>"John. . ."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>John.  In the sound of that rebellious word
<dt>There is brave music.  Jack, and Jacobin,
<dt>Are vulgar terms; law-linked to shame and sin,
<dt>They have a twang of Jack the Hangman's cord:
<dt>Yet John hath merit which can well afford
<dt>To be called Jack's.  By life's strange offs and ons!
<dt>Glory hath had great dealings with the Johns,
<dt>Since history first awaked where fable snored.
<dt>John Cade, John Huss, John Hampden, and John Knox!
<dt>Ay, these were the names of fellows who had will.
<dt>John Wilson's name, far sounded, sounds not ill;
<dt>But how unlike John Milton's or John Locke's!
<dt>John Bright, like Locke and Milton, scorns paid sloth;
<dt>And Johnson might have liked to gibbet both.
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>Poet vs. Parson</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A hireling's wages to the priest are paid;
<dt>While lives and dies, in want and rags, the bard!
<dt>But preaching ought to be its own reward,
<dt>And not a sordid, if an honest trade.
<dt>Paul, laboring proudly with his hands, arrayed
<dt>Regenerated hearts in peace and love;
<dt>And when, with power, they preached the mystic dove,
<dt>Penn, Barclay, Clarkson, asked not Mammon's aid.
<dt>As, for its own sake, poetry is sweet
<dt>To poets--so, on tasks of mercy bound,
<dt>Religion travels with unsandaled feet,
<dt>Making the flinty desert holy ground;
<dt>And never will her triumph be complete
<dt>While one paid pilgrim upon earth is found.
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>Trees at Brimham</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Gnarled oak and holly! stone-cropped like the stone!
<dt>Are ye of it, or is it part of you?
<dt>Your union strange is marvellously true,
<dt>And makes the granite which I stand upon
<dt>Seem like the vision of an empire gone,
<dt>Gone, yet still present, though it never was
<dt>Save as a shadow,--let the shadow pass!
<dt>So perish human glories, every one!

<dt>But, rocks! ye are not shadows; trees! ye cast
<dt>The Almighty's shadow over the homeward bee,
<dt>His name on Brimham! yea, the coming blast
<dt>Beneath his curtains reads it here with me,
<dt>And pauses not to number marvels past
<dt>But speeds the thunder on over land and sea.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Powers of the Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Why should the tiny harp be chained to themes
<dt>In fourteen lines, with pedant rigour bound?
<dt>The sonnet's might is mightier than it seems:
<dt>Witness the bard of Eden lost and found,
<dt>Who gave this lute a clarion's battle sound.
<dt>And lo! another Milton calmly turns
<dt>His eyes within, a light that ever burns,
<dt>Waiting till Wordsworth's second peer be found!
<dt>Meantime, <a href="#999">Fitzadam's</a> mournful music shows
<dt>That the scorned sonnet's charm may yet endear
<dt>Some long deep strain, or lay of well-tolled woes;
<dt>Such as in Byron's couplet brings a tear
<dt>To manly cheeks, or over his stanza throws
<dt>Rapture and grief, solemnity and fear.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>"Toy of the Titans!..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Toy of the Titans!  Tiny Harp! again
<dt>I quarrel with the order of thy strings,
<dt>Established by the law of sonnet-kings,
<dt>And used by giants who do nought in vain.
<dt>Was Petrarch, then mistaken in the strain
<dt>That charms Italia?  Were they tasteless things
<dt>That Milton wrought?  And are they mutterings
<dt>Untuneful, that pay Wordsworth with pleased pain?
<dt>No. But I see that tyrants come of slaves;
<dt>That states are won by rush of robbers' steel;
<dt>And millions starved and tortured to their graves,
<dt>Because as they are taught men think and feel;
<dt>Therefore, I change the sonnet's slavish notes
<dt>For cheaper music, suited to my thoughts.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Fountains Abbey</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Abbey! for ever smiling pensively,
<dt>How like a thing of Nature dost thou rise
<dt>Amid her loveliest works! as if the skies,
<dt>Clouded with grief, were arched thy roof to be,
<dt>And the tall trees were copied all from thee!
<dt>Mourning thy fortunes--while the waters dim
<dt>Flow like the memory of thy evening hymn,
<dt>Beautiful in their sorrowing sympathy;
<dt>As if they with a weeping sister wept,
<dt>Winds name thy name! But thou, though sad, art calm,
<dt>And Time with thee his plighted troth hath kept;
<dt>For harebells deck thy brow, and, at thy feet,
<dt>Where sleep the proud, the bee and redbreast meet,
<dt>Mixing thy sighs with Nature's lonely psalm.
<p>
