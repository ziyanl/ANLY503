<p>"I am glad to be able to give this sonnet by one who has written so much and such original poetry as Dr. Hake has done. Dr. Hake has written few sonnets. [This one] is not from any of his volumes of verse, but is taken from <i>The Academy</i>, where it appeared in April, 1884." (<a href="bibliogr.htm#sharp1">Sharp</a>)

<a name=010></a><h2>Venus Urania</h2>
<p>
<dt>Is this thy Paphos,--the devoted place
<dt>Where rests, in its own eventide, thy shrine?
<dt>To thee not lone is solitude divine
<dt>Where love-dreams o'er thy waves each other chase
<dt>And melt into the passion of thy face!
<dt>The twilight waters, dolphin-stained, are thine;
<dt>The silvery depths and blue, night-orbed, entwine,
<dt>And in bright films thy rosy form embrace,--
<dt>Girdling thy loins with heaven-spun drapery
<dt>Wove in the looms of thy resplendent sea.
<dt>The columns point their shadows to the plain,
<dt>And ancient days are dialed o'er again;
<dt>The floods remember: falling at thy feet,
<dt>Upon the sands of time they ever beat.
