<a name="010"></a><h2>On the Death of <a href="aldrich.htm">Thomas Bailey Aldrich</a></h2>
<h3>(March 19, 1907)</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>WHAT sudden bird will bring us any cheer
<dt>Whose song in the chill dawn gives hope of Spring;
<dt>Can we be glad to give it welcoming
<dt>Though April in its music be so near?
<dt>Not while the burden of our memories bear
<dt>The weight of silence that we know will cling
<dt>About the lips that nevermore will sing
<dt>The heart of him with visions voiced so clear.
<p>
<dt>There is a pause in meeting before speech
<dt>Between men who have fed their souls with song;
<dt>The strangeness of an echo beyond reach
<dt>Cleaves silence deep for speech to pass along.
<dt>There are no words to tell the loss, but each
<dt>Of our hearts feels the sorrow deep and strong.
<p>
<h3>II</h3>
<dt>The Wondersmith in vocables is dead! 
<dt>The Builder of the palaces of rhyme
<dt>Shall build no more his music out of Time.
<dt>In the deep, breathless peace to which he fled
<dt>He sits with Landor's hands upon his head
<dt>Watching our suns and stars that sink and climb
<dt>Between him and our tears' continuous chime --
<dt>Sorrowing for his presence vanishèd.
<p>
<dt>Aldrich is dead! but the glory of his life
<dt>Is in his song, and this will keep his name
<dt>Safe above change and the assaults of strife.
<dt>Poet, whose artistry, his constant aim
<dt>Kept true above defections that were rife,
<dt>Death taking him, still leaves his deathless fame.

<h3><i>For His Eighty-third Birthday</i></h3>
<p>
<dt>BENEATH the bare-boughed Cambridge elms to-day
<dt>Time takes no flight in his unwintered heart;
<dt>Where fourscore years and three came to depart,
<dt>The vision shines that cannot burn away.
<dt>In perils of change his voice is still our stay, 
<dt>Who kept the true direction from the start.
<dt>He knew no deed born from his thoughts apart --
<dt>And held his pen Truth's summons to obey.
<p>
<dt>O reverend head, take this our crown of praise,
<dt>On this, thy Birthday, hallowed by our love;
<dt>A soldier's honor and a poet's bays;
<dt>In public heed thy virtues held to prove --
<dt>Though long, we wish thee longer, length of days,
<dt>To lead us up the heights where we would move.
<p>

<p>
<dt>HE heard the four winds and the seven seas,
<dt>And voices inland under alien stars,
<dt>And drove ambition like auroral cars
<dt>Striking the hill-tops when the darkness flees.
<dt>Vain in his dreams, but brave in his vanities;
<dt>No carpet-knight yet versed in parlor wars;
<dt>And half a rogue when honesty debars
<dt>The desire to take the prize his fancy sees.
<p>
<dt>And yet he knew the silences of speech --
<dt>The leaf-heard utterance of April rains;
<dt>The echoes in the twilight out of reach
<dt>Beyond the dim horizon where it wanes.
<dt>And like the distant sea-wash on the beach
<dt>He sang a few sad tender lyric strains.
