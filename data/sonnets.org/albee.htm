published few sonnets in his book.&nbsp; The first of those selected will remind 
one, by its wide horizon, of the natural effect in <a href="http://sonnets.org/keats.htm#100">Keats's sonnet on Chapman's

<h2><a name="fading"></a>Fading Barriers</h2>
<p>
<dt>If I have ever told you all my heart
<dt>Was yours, and perfect was the love it bore,
<dt>Believe it not!  For in the time past o'er
<dt>I, like some world-wide traveler, would start
<dt>And gaze astonished where the mountains part,
<dt>Thinking of mountain peaks beyond no more,
<dt>As dimly climbing from the heaven's blue shore
<dt> On loftier heights the splendor falls athwart.
<dt>      
<dt>       
<dt>So while I dream all perfect is the bliss
<dt>Which years have added to my soul in thine,
<dt>And say, here must be the eternal bound,
<dt>Lo, in my heart some thought of thee doth kiss
<dt>Into clear light that undetermined line
<dt>Which hovers on the heaven of love profound. 
<h2><a name="recreation"></a>Recreation in Love</h2>
<dt>That thou art high above me I have found&nbsp;
<dt>Full oft; when all alone my heavy brain
<dt>Turns from itself to thee, my thoughts regain
<dt>A place so far beyond their usual bound
<dt>I know they climb of other stairs the round
<dt>Than those which their aspiring flights restrain
<dt>In this dull house of clay.&nbsp; Come, not in vain
<dt>Thy height shall raise me from this lifeless ground.
<dt>     
<dt>Let me from thine my lampless way rewin;
<dt>Usurp this empty-falling tenement
<dt>With ruin underset, o'erhung by night;
<dt>Replenish it with all that once has been,
<dt>When all it had or wished thy presence lent,
<dt>And love trimmed fresh the intellectual light. 
<h2><a name="keats"></a>Keats's Love-Letters</h2>     
<dt>Rest, hunted spirit!&nbsp; Canst thou never sleep?
<dt>Ah, when the ghouls and vampires of the Press
<dt>Vex all thy tender soul in wantonness,
<dt>Canst thou know aught of peace, but still must weep!
<dt>What!&nbsp; shall thy heart's rich blood, poured out so deep,
<dt>Be made a merchandise without redress,
<dt>Nor any voice the world's base deed confess
<dt>Which prints and sells a poet's love so cheap?
<dt>     
<dt>My curse upon this prying, prurient age!
<dt>And curst the eyes not closed in angry shame!
<dt>For him whom English air and critic pen
<dt>Twice baffled ere his splendid, youthful gage
<dt>Had measured half the heaven of love and fame,
<dt>This shameless book has murdered once again!
