<dt>I saw you starting for another war,
<dt>The emblem of adventure and of youth,
<dt>So that men trembled, saying: "He forsooth
<dt>Has gone, has gone, and shall return no more."
<dt>And then out there, they told me you were dead,
<dt>Taken and killed; how was it that I knew,
<dt>Whatever else was true, that was not true?
<dt>And then I saw you pale upon your bed,
<dt>Scarcely two years ago, when you were sent
<dt>Back from the margin of the dim abyss;
<dt>For Death had sealed you with a warning kiss,
<dt>And let you go to meet a nobler fate:
<dt>To fight for hearth and home, O fortunate,
<dt>To die in battle with your regiment.
