<p>"Born in Rondout, N.Y., 1842, he has had considerable 
experience in journalistic work, and is now a prosperous grain-dealer.&nbsp; He 
is a member of the Authors' Club of New York, also of the New York Produce 
Exchange.&nbsp; One of his volumes was reprinted in London.&nbsp; He is his own 
publisher. (Kingston, N.Y.)." (<a href="bibliogr.htm#crandall">Crandall</a>)
<h2>   Faith's Vista</h2>
<p>
<dt>When from the vaulted wonder of the sky
<dt>The curtain of the light is drawn aside,
<dt>And I behold the stars in all their wide
<dt>Significance and glorious mystery,
<dt>Assured that those more distant orbs are suns
<dt>Round which innumerable worlds revolve,
<dt>My faith grows strong, my day-born doubts dissolve,
<dt>And death, that dread annulment which life shuns,
<dt>       
<dt>
<dt>Or fain would shun, becomes to life the way,
<dt>The thoroughfare to greater worlds on high,
<dt>The bridge from star to star.&nbsp; Seek how we may,
<dt>There is no other road across the sky;
<dt>And, looking up, I hear star-voices say:
<dt>"You could not reach us if you did not die."
