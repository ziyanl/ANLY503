<p>"From <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1882. On a small scale, a kind of American Christopher North. Despite his own conviction that he had 'written one of the finest sonnets in the language,' he was no sonneteer. His most enduring poem will probably prove to be the Praed-like lyric, 'Wouldn't you like to know?'" (<a href="bibliogr.htm#sharp">Sharp</a>)

<a name=010></a><h2>Love Crowned</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A maiden, with a garland on her head,
<dt>Sat in her bower between two lovers: one
<dt>Wore such a wreath as hers; the other none.
<dt>But him, in merry wise, she garlanded
<dt>With that she wore; then, gaily, took instead
<dt>The other's wreath and wore it as her own;
<dt>Whereat both smiled, each deeming she had shown
<dt>Himself the favourite. Though she nothing said
<dt>Concerning this by any spoken word,
<dt>Yet by her act, methinks, the maid preferred
<dt>The lover she discrowned. A friendly thing
<dt>Or whimsical--no more--the gift she gave,
<dt>(A queen might do as much by any slave),
<dt>But he whose crown she wore was her heart's king.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>"With my body I thee worship"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>That I adore thee, my most gracious queen,
<dt>More in my spirit than my body's sense
<dt>Of thine, were such incredible pretence
<dt>As I would scorn to utter. Thou hast seen
<dt>When eyes and lips, responsive to the heart,
<dt>Were bent in worship of thy lips and eyes,
<dt>Until, O bliss! each pleasure-pulsing part
<dt>Hath found its fellow in Love's sweet emprise;
<dt>Each answering other in such eager wise
<dt>As they would never cease to kiss and cling--
<dt>Ah! then meseemed amid the storm of sighs
<dt>I heard thy voice exclaiming, "O my King!
<dt>So may my soul be ever true to thine,
<dt>As with thy body thou dost worship mine!"
