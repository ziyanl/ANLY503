<p>
<dt>Bayard, awaken not this music strong,
<dt>While round thy home the indolent sweet breeze
<dt>Floats lightly as the summer breath of seas
<dt>O'er which Ulysses heard the Siren's song.
<dt>Dreams of low-lying isles to June belong,
<dt>And Circe holds us in her haunts of ease;
<dt>But later, when these high ancestral trees
<dt>Are sere, and such melodious languors wrong
<dt>The reddening strength of the autumnal year,
<dt>Yield to heroic words thy ear and eye;--
<dt>Intent on these broad pages thou shalt hear
<dt>The trumpets' blare, the Argive battle-cry,
<dt>And see Achilles hurl his hurtling spear,
<dt>And mark the Trojan arrows make reply!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>A Mother's Picture</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>She seemed an angel to our infant eyes!
<dt>Once, when the glorifying moon revealed
<dt>Her who at evening by our pillow kneeled,
<dt>Soft-voiced and golden-haired, from holy skies
<dt>Flown to her loves on wings of Paradise,--
<dt>We looked to see the pinions half concealed
<dt>The Tuscan vines and olives will not yield
<dt>Her back to me, who loved her in this wise,
<dt>And since have little known her, but have grown
<dt>To see another mother, tenderly
<dt>Watch over sleeping children of my own.
<dt>Perchance the years have changed her: yet alone
<dt>This picture lingers; still she seems to me
<dt>The fair young angel of my infancy.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Hope Deferred</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Bring no more flowers and books and precious things!
<dt>O speak no more of our beloved Art,
<dt>Of summer haunts,--melodious wanderings
<dt>In leafy refuge from this weary mart!
<dt>Surely such thoughts were dear unto my heart;
<dt>Now every word a newer sadness brings!
<dt>Thus oft some forest-bird caged far apart
<dt>From verdurous freedom, droops his careless wings,
<dt>Nor craves for more than food from day to day;
<dt>So long bereft of wild-wood joy and song,
<dt>Hopeless of all he dared to hope so long,
<dt>The music born within him dies away;
<dt>Even the song he loved becomes a pain,
<dt>Full-freighted with a yearning all in vain.
