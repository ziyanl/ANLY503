<p>
<dt>In the cold change which time hath wrought on love
<dt>(The snowy winter of his summer prime),
<dt>Should a chance sigh or sudden tear-drop move
<dt>Thy heart to memory of the olden time;
<dt>Turn not to gaze on me with pitying eyes,
<dt>Nor mock me with a withered hope renewed;
<dt>But from the bower we both have loved, arise
<dt>And leave me to my barren solitude!
<p>
<dt>What boots it that a momentary flame
<dt>Shoots from the ashes of a dying fire?
<dt>We gaze upon the hearth from whence it came,
<dt>And know the exhausted embers must expire:
<dt>Therefore no pity, or my heart will break;
<dt>Be cold, be careless--for thy past love's sake!
<p>

<p>
<dt>Silent companions of the lonely hour,
<dt>Friends, who can never alter or forsake,
<dt>Who for inconstant roving have no power,
<dt>And all neglect, perforce, must calmly take,--
<dt>Let me return to you; this turmoil ending
<dt>Which worldly cares have in my spirit wrought,
<dt>And, o'er your old familiar pages bending,
<dt>Refresh my mind with many a tranquil thought:
<dt>Till, haply meeting there, from time to time,
<dt>Fancies, the audible echo of my own,
<dt>'Twill be like hearing in a foreign clime
<dt>My native language spoke in friendly tone,
<dt>And with a sort of welcome I shall dwell
<dt>On these, my unripe musings, told so well.
