<p>
<dt>Go you, O winds that blow from north to south,
<dt>Convey my secret sighs unto my sweet;
<dt>Deliver them from mine unto her mouth,
<dt>And make my commendations till we meet.
<dt>But if perhaps her proud aspiring sprite
<dt>Will not accept nor yet receive the same,
<dt>The breast and bulwark of her bosom beat,
<dt>Knock at her heart, and tell from whence you came;
<dt>Importune her, nor cease nor shrink for shame.
<dt>Sport with her curls of amber-colored hair,
<dt>And when she sighs, immix yourselves with thame,
<dt>Give her her own, and thus beguile the fair.
<dt>Blow winds, fly sighs, whereas my heart doth haunt,
<dt>And secretly commend me to my saunt.

<p>
<dt>Now, while amid those dainty downs and dales
<dt>With shepherd swains I sit, unknown to me,
<dt>We sweetly sing and tell pastoral tales,
<dt>But my discourse and song's theme is of thee.
<dt>For otherways, alas, how can it be?
<dt>Let Venus leave her blest abode above
<dt>To tempt my love, yet thou, sweet soul, shalt see
<dt>That I thy man and thou shalt die my love.
<dt>No tract of time nor sad eclipse of place
<dt>Nor absence long, which sometime were due cures
<dt>To my disease, shall make thy slave to cease
<dt>From serving thee till life or breath endures;
<dt>And till we meet, my rustic mates and I
<dt>Through woods and plains Pandora's praise shall cry.
