<a name=000></a><h2>A Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A Sonnet is a moment's monument,--
<dt>Memorial from the Soul's eternity
<dt>To one dead deathless hour. Look that it be,
<dt>Whether for lustral rite or dire portent,
<dt>Of its own arduous fulness reverent:
<dt>Carve it in ivory or in ebony,
<dt>As Day or Night may rule; and let Time see
<dt>Its flowering crest impearled and orient.
<p><dt>A Sonnet is a coin: its face reveals
<dt>The soul,--its converse, to what Power 'tis due:--
<dt>Whether for tribute to the august appeals
<dt>Of Life, or dower in Love's high retinue,
<dt>It serve, or, 'mid the dark wharf's cavernous breath,
<dt>In Charon's palm it pay the toll to Death.
</p>
<a name=006></a><h2>The Kiss</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What smouldering senses in death's sick delay
<dt>Or seizure of malign vicissitude
<dt>Can rob this body of honour, or denude
<dt>This soul of wedding-raiment worn to-day?
<dt>For lo! even now my lady's lips did play
<dt>With these my lips such consonant interlude
<dt>As laurelled Orpheus longed for when he wooed
<dt>The half-drawn hungering face with that last lay.
<p>
<dt>I was a child beneath her touch,--a man
<dt>When breast to breast we clung, even I and she,--
<dt>A spirit when her spirit looked through me,--
<dt>A god when all our life-breath met to fan
<dt>Our life-blood, till love's emulous ardours ran,
<dt>Fire within fire, desire in deity.
</p>
<p><a name=0061></a><h2>Nuptial Sleep</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>At length their long kiss severed, with sweet smart:
<dt>And as the last slow sudden drops are shed
<dt>From sparkling eaves when all the storm has fled,
<dt>So singly flagged the pulses of each heart.
<dt>Their bosoms sundered, with the opening start
<dt>Of married flowers to either side outspread
<dt>From the knit stem; yet still their mouths, burnt red,
<dt>Fawned on each other where they lay apart.
<p>
<dt>Sleep sank them lower than the tide of dreams,
<dt>And their dreams watched them sink, and slid away.
<dt>Slowly their souls swam up again, through gleams
<dt>Of watered light and dull drowned waifs of day;
<dt>Till from some wonder of new woods and streams
<dt>He woke, and wondered more: for there she lay.
</p>
<p>
<a name=019></a><h2>Silent Noon</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Your hands lie open in the long fresh grass,--
<dt>The finger-points look through like rosy blooms:
<dt>Your eyes smile peace. The pasture gleams and glooms
<dt>'Neath billowing skies that scatter and amass.
<dt>All round our nest, far as the eye can pass,
<dt>Are golden kingcup-fields with silver edge
<dt>Where the cow-parsley skirts the hawthorn-hedge.
<dt>'Tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass.
<p>
<dt>Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fly
<dt>Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:--
<dt>So this wing'd hour is dropt to us from above.
<dt>Oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower,
<dt>This close-companioned inarticulate hour
<dt>When twofold silence was the song of love.
</p>
<p>
<a name=097></a><h2>A Superscription</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been;
<dt>I am also called No-more, Too-late, Farewell;
<dt>Unto thine ear I hold the dead-sea shell
<dt>Cast up thy Life's foam-fretted feet between;
<dt>Unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen
<dt>Which had Life's form and Love's, but by my spell
<dt>Is now a shaken shadow intolerable,
<dt>Of ultimate things unuttered the frail screen.
<p>
<dt>Mark me, how still I am I But should there dart
<dt>One moment through thy soul the soft surprise
<dt>Of that winged Peace which lulls the breath of sighs,
<dt>Then shalt thou see me smile, and turn apart
<dt>Thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart
<dt>Sleepless with cold commemorative eyes.
</p>
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>For a Venetian Pastoral</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Water, for anguish of the solstice:--nay,
<dt>But dip the vessel slowly,--nay, but lean
<dt>And hark how at its verge the wave sighs in
<dt>Reluctant.  Hush! Beyond all depth away
<dt>The heat lies silent at the brink of day:
<dt>Now the hand trails upon the viol-string
<dt>That sobs, and the brown faces cease to sing,
<dt>Sad with the whole of pleasure.  Whither stray
<dt>Her eyes now, from whose mouth the slim pipes creep
<dt>And leave it pouting, while the shadowed grass
<dt>Is cool against her naked side?  Let be:--
<dt>Say nothing now unto her lest she weep,
<dt>Nor name this ever.  Be it as it was,--
<dt>Life touching lips with Immortality.
