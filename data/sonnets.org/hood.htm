<a name=100></a><h2>Silence</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>There is a silence where hath been no sound,
<dt>There is a silence where no sound may be,
<dt>In the cold grave--under the deep deep sea,
<dt>Or in the wide desert where no life is found,
<dt>Which hath been mute, and still must sleep profound;
<dt>No voice is hushed--no life treads silently,
<dt>But clouds and cloudy shadows wander free,
<dt>That never spoke, over the idle ground:
<dt>But in green ruins, in the desolate walls
<dt>Of antique palaces, where Man hath been,
<dt>Thoughl the dun fox, or wild hyaena, calls,
<dt>And owls, that flit continually between,
<dt>Shriek to the echo, and the low winds moan,
<dt>There the true Silence is, self-conscious and alone.
</P>
<a name=200></a><h2>Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>It is not death, that sometime in a sigh
<dt>This eloquent breath shall take its speechless flight;
<dt>That sometime these bright stars, that now reply
<dt>In sunlight to the sun, shall set in night;
<dt>That this warm conscious flesh shall perish quite,
<dt>And all life's ruddy springs forget to flow;
<dt>That thoughts shall cease, and the immortal sprite
<dt>Be lapped in alien clay and laid below;
<dt>It is not death to know this,--but to know
<dt>That pious thoughts, which visit at new graves
<dt>In tender pilgrimage, will cease to go
<dt>So duly and so oft,--and when grass waves
<dt>Over the past-away, there may be then
<dt>No resurrection in the minds of men.
</P>
<a name=300></a><h2>"The world is with me..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>The world is with me, and its many cares,
<dt>Its woes--its wants--the anxious hopes and fears
<dt>That wait on all terrestrial affairs--
<dt>The shades of former and of future years--
<dt>Forboding fancies and prophetic tears,
<dt>Quelling a spirit that was once elate.
<dt>Heavens! what a wilderness the world appears,
<dt>Where youth, and mirth, and health are out of date;
<dt>But no--a laugh of innocence and joy
<dt>Resounds, like music of the fairy race,
<dt>And, gladly turning from the world's annoy,
<dt>I gaze upon a little radiant face,
<dt>And bless, internally, the merry boy
<dt>Who "makes a <i>son-shine</i> in a shady place."

<a name=400></a><h2>On Mistress Nicely, a Pattern for Housekeepers</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>She was a woman peerless in her station,
<dt>With household virtues wedded to her name;
<dt>Spotless in linen, grass-bleached in her fame;
<dt>And pure and clear-starched in her conversation;
<dt>Thence in my Castle of Imagination
<dt>She dwells for evermore, the dainty dame,
<dt>To keep all airy draperies from shame
<dt>And all dream furnitures in preservation:
<p>
<dt>There walketh she with keys quite silver bright,
<dt>In perfect hose and shoes of seemly black,
<dt>Apron and stomacher of lily white,
<dt>And decent order follows in her track:
<dt>The burnished plate grows lustrous in her sight,
<dt>And polished floors and tables shine her back.
<p>
<a name=410></a><h2>Allegory: A Moral Vehicle</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I had a gig-horse, and I called him Pleasure
<dt>Because on Sundays for a little jaunt
<dt>He was so fast and showy, quite a treasure;
<dt>Although he sometimes kicked and shied aslant.
<dt>I had a chaise, and christened it Enjoyment,
<dt>With yellow body and the wheels of red,
<dt>Because it was only used for one employment,
<dt>Namely, to go wherever Pleasure led.
<dt>I had a wife, her nickname was Delight:
<dt>A son called Frolic, who was never still:
<dt>Alas! how often dark succeeds to bright!
<dt>Delight was thrown, and Frolic had a spill,
<dt>Enjoyment was upset and shattered quite,
<dt>And Pleasure fell a splitter on Paine's Hill.

<a name=420></a><h2>Christmas Holidays</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Along the Woodford road there comes a noise
<dt>Of wheels, and Mr. Rounding's neat post-chaise
<dt>Struggles along, drawn by a pair of bays,
<dt>With Reverend Mr. Crow and six small boys,
<dt>Who ever and anon declare their joys
<dt>With trumping horns and juvenile huzzas,
<dt>At going home to spend their Christmas days,
<dt>And changing learning's pains for pleasure's toys.

<dt>Six weeks elapse, and down the Woodford way
<dt>A heavy coach drags six more heavy souls,
<dt>But no glad urchins shout, no trumpets bray,
<dt>The carriage makes a halt, the gate-bell tolls,
<dt>And little boys walk in as dull and mum
<dt>As six new scholars to the Deaf and Dumb!
