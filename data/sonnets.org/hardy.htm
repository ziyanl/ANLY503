<h2><i>She, to Him</i></h2>
<a name=001></a><h2>I</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When you shall see me in the toils of Time,
<dt>My lauded beauties carried off from me,
<dt>My eyes no longer stars as in their prime,
<dt>My name forgot of Maiden Fair and Free;
<p>
<dt>When, in your being, heart concedes to mind,
<dt>And judgment, though you scarce its process know,
<dt>Recalls the excellencies I once enshrined,
<dt>And you are irked that they have withered so;
<p>
<dt>Remembering mine the loss is, not the blame,
<dt>That Sportsman Time but rears his brood to kill,
<dt>Knowing me in my soul the very same
<dt>One who would die to spare you touch of ill!
<dt>Will you not grant to old affection's claim
<dt>The hand of friendship down Life's sunless hill?
</p>
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>II</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Perhaps, long hence, when I have passed away,
<dt>Some other's feature, accent, thought like mine,
<dt>Will carry you back to what I used to say,
<dt>And bring some memory of your love's decline.
<p>
<dt>Then you may pause awhile and think, "Poor jade!"
<dt>And yield a sigh to me--as ample due,
<dt>Not as the tittle of a debt unpaid
<dt>To one who could resign her all to you
<p>
<dt>And thus reflecting, you will never see
<dt>That your thin thought, in two small words conveyed,
<dt>Was no such fleeting phantom-thought to me,
<dt>But the Whole Life wherein my part was played;
<dt>And you amid its fitful masquerade
<dt>A Thought--as I in your life seem to be!
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I will be faithful to thee; aye, I will!
<dt>And Death shall choose me with a wondering eye
<dt>That he did not discern and domicile
<dt>One his by right ever since that last Good-bye!
<p>
<dt>I have no care for friends, or kin, or prime
<dt>Of manhood who deal gently with me here;
<dt>Amid the happy people of my time
<dt>Who work their love's fulfilment, I appear
<p>
<dt>Numb as a vane that cankers on its point,
<dt>True to the wind that kissed ere canker came:
<dt>Despised by souls of Now, who would disjoint
<dt>The mind from memory, making Life all aim,
<dt>My old dexterities in witchery gone,
<dt>And nothing left for Love to look upon.
</p>
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>IV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>This love puts all humanity from me;
<dt>I can but maledict her, pray her dead,
<dt>For giving love and getting love of thee
<dt>Feeding a heart that else mine own had fed!
<p>
<dt>How much I love I know not, life not known,
<dt>Save as one unit I would add love by;
<dt>But this I know, my being is but thine own
<dt>Fused from its separateness by ecstasy.
<p>
<dt>And thus I grasp thy amplitudes, of her
<dt>Ungrasped, though helped by rough-regarding eyes;
<dt>Canst thou then hate me as an envier
<dt>Who see unrecked what I so dearly prize?
<dt>Believe me, Lost One, Love is lovelier
<dt>The more it shapes its moan in selfish-wise.
</p>
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>Hap</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If but some vengeful god would call to me
<dt>From up the sky, and laugh: "Thou suffering thing,
<dt>Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy,
<dt>That thy love's loss is my hate's profiting!"
<p>
<dt>Then would I bear it, clench myself, and die,
<dt>Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited;
<dt>Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I
<dt>Had willed and meted me the tears I shed.
<p>
<dt>But not so. How arrives it joy lies slain,
<dt>And why unblooms the best hope ever sown?
<dt>--Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain,
<dt>And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan. . . .
<dt>These purblind Doomsters had as readily strown
<dt>Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain.
</p>
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>At a Lunar Eclipse</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thy shadow, Earth, from Pole to Central Sea,
<dt>Now steals along upon the Moon's meek shine
<dt>In even monochrome and curving line
<dt>Of imperturbable serenity.
<p>
<dt>How shall I link such sun-cast symmetry
<dt>With the torn troubled form I know as thine,
<dt>That profile, placid as a brow divine,
<dt>With continents of moil and misery?
<p>
<dt>And can immense Mortality but throw
<dt>So small a shade, and Heaven's high human scheme
<dt>Be hemmed within the coasts yon arc implies?
<p>
<dt>Is such the stellar gauge of earthly show,
<dt>Nation at war with nation, brains that teem,
<dt>Heroes, and women fairer than the skies?
</p>
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>In the Cemetery</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>"You see those mothers squabbling there?"
<dt>Remarks the man of the cemetery.
<dt>"One says in tears, ''Tis mine lies here!'
<dt>Another, 'Nay, mine, you Pharisee!'
<dt>Another, 'How dare you move my flowers
<dt>And put your own on this grave of ours!'
<dt>But all their children were laid therein
<dt>At different times, like sprats in a tin.
<dt>"And then the main drain had to cross,
<dt>And we moved the lot some nights ago,
<dt>And packed them away in the general foss
<dt>With hundreds more. But their folks don't know,
<dt>And as well cry over a new-laid drain
<dt>As anything else, to ease your pain!"
</p>
<p>
<a name=400></a><h2>At the Altar-Rail</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>"My bride is not coming, alas!" says the groom,
<dt>And the telegram shakes in his hand. "I own
<dt>It was hurried! We met at a dancing-room
<dt>When I went to the Cattle-Show alone,
<dt>And then, next night, where the Fountain leaps,
<dt>And the Street of the Quarter-Circle sweeps.
<p>
<dt>"Ay, she won me to ask her to be my wife--
<dt>'Twas foolish perhaps!--to forsake the ways
<dt>Of the flaring town for a farmer's life.
<dt>She agreed. And we fixed it. Now she says:
<dt><i>It's sweet of you, dear, to prepare me a nest,
<dt>But a swift, short, gay life suits me best.
<dt>What I really am you have never gleaned;
<dt>I had eaten the apple ere you were weaned.</i>"
</p>
<p>
<a name=500></a><h2>The Pity of It</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I walked in loamy Wessex lanes, afar
<dt>From rail-track and from highway, and I heard
<dt>In field and farmstead many an ancient word
<dt>Of local lineage like "Thu bist," "Er war,"
<p>
<dt>"Ich woll," "Er sholl," and by-talk similar,
<dt>Nigh as they speak who in this month's moon gird
<dt>At England's very loins, thereunto spurred
<dt>By gangs whose glory threats and slaughters are.
<p>
<dt>Then seemed a Heart crying: "Whosoever they be
<dt>At root and bottom of this, who flung this flame
<dt>Between folk kin tongued even as are we,
<p>
<dt>"Sinister, ugly, lurid, be their fame;
<dt>May their familiars grow to shun their name,
<dt>And their brood perish everlastingly."
