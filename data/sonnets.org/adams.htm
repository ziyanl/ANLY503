<p>From <i> Post-Laureate Idyls</i> (1886)
<h2>Indifference</h2>
<p>
<dt>What is indifference, do you ask of me?
<dt>O well I know the meaning of the phrase.
<dt>It is to find grey ash instead of blaze
<dt>That warmed you once; to lose, alas! the key
<dt>Which turned in friendship's wards; to sometime see
<dt>The eyes that shone for you in other days
<dt>Now coldly meet your own in passing gaze;
<dt>To know that what has been no more shall be.

<p>It is to find that you in naught believe,</p>                
<dt>To know that youth has fled far down the past,
<dt>To feel that hope will ne'er again be born,
<dt>And love is but a poor worn cheat at last.
<dt>It is all this, <i>yet not for this to grieve,--</i>
<dt><i>To live and heed not that one lives forlorn!</i>
<p>
(Text from <a href="bibliogr.htm#sharp">American Sonnets</a>)</p>

<h2> Renunciation</h2>
<p></p>
<dt>Nay, friend, farewell! for if I loved you 
  less,
<dt>It might be I should strive to hold you 
  fast
  <dt>In bonds of friendship you had long 
  o'erpast,
  <dt>And play the tyrant where I hoped to 
  bless.
  <dt>Yet, since my love still pleads, I fain would 
  press
  <dt>Once more your hand e'en while I seem to 
  cast
  <dt>It coldly from me with these words at 
  last,--
  <dt><i>I may not keep and you may not possess!</i>
  <p></p>
  <dt>Sweet friend, believe me, it is better so,--
  <dt>To part while love finds yet no cause for grief
  <dt>In slowly-waning faith, lest haply you
  <dt>Should one day find some flaw in me you knew
  <dt>Not of, and I through tears should watch you go,
  <dt>  Knowing your soul in mine had lost belief.
  <dt>
