<p>
<dd>"Poor heart, what bitter words we speak
<dd>When God speaks of resigning!"
<p>
<dt>Children, that lay their pretty garlands by
<dt>So piteously, yet with a humble mind;
<dt>Sailors, who, when their ship rocks in the wind,
<dt>Cast out her freight with half-averted eye,
<dt>Riches for life exchanging solemnly,
<dt>Lest they should never gain the wished-for shore;--
<dt>Thus we, O Father, standing Thee before,
<dt>Do lay down at Thy feet without a sigh
<dt>Each after each our precious things and rare,
<dt>Our dear heart-jewels and our garlands fair.
<dt>Perhaps Thou knewest that the flowers would die,
<dt>And the long-voyaged boards be found but dust:
<dt>So took'st them, while unchanged. To Thee we trust
<dt>For incorruptible treasure: Thou art just.
<p>
<a name=S></a><h2>Saint Elizabeth of Bohemia</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dd>"Would that we two were lying
<dd>Beneath the churchyard sod,
<dd>With our limbs at rest in the green earth's breast,
<dd>And our souls at home with God."
<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;--Kingsley's Saint's Tragedy.
<p>
<dt><a name=002><h2>I</h2></a>
<p>
<dt>I never lay me down to sleep at night
<dt>But in my heart I sing that little song:
<dt>The angels hear it as, a pitying throng,
<dt>They touch my burning lids with fingers bright
<dt>As moonbeams, pale, impalpable, and light:
<dt>And when my daily pious tasks are done,
<dt>And all my patient prayers said one by one,
<dt>God hears it. Seems it sinful in His sight
<dt>That round my slow burnt-offering of quenched will
<dt>One quivering human sigh creeps wind-like still?
<dt>That when my orisons celestial fail
<dt>Rises one note of natural human wail?
<dt>Dear lord, spouse, hero, martyr, saint! erelong,
<dt>I trust, God will forgive my singing that poor song.
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>II</h2>
<p>
<dt>A year ago I bade my little son
<dt>Bear upon pilgrimage a heavy load
<dt>Of alms; he cried, half-fainting on the road,
<dt>"Mother, O mother, would the day were done!"
<dt>Him I reproved with tears, and said, "Go on!
<dt>Nor pause nor murmur till thy task be o'er."--
<dt>Would not God say to me the same, and more?
<dt>I will not sing that song. Thou, dearest one,
<dt>Husband--no, brother!--stretch thy steadfast hand
<dt>And let mine grasp it. Now, I also stand,
<dt>My woman weakness nerved to strength like thine;
<dt>We'll quaff life's aloe-cup as if 't were wine
<dt>Each to the other; journeying on apart,
<dt>Till at heaven's golden doors we two leap heart to heart.
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>Marriage-Table</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dd>W. H. L. and F. R.
<p>
<dt>There was a marriage-table where One sate,
<dt>Haply, unnoticed, till they craved His aid:
<dt>Thenceforward does it seem that He has made
<dt>All virtuous marriage-tables consecrate:
<dt>And so, at this, where without pomp or state
<dt>We sit, and only say, or mute, are fain
<dt>To wish the simple words "God bless these twain!"
<dt>I think that He who "in the midst" doth wait
<dt>Oft-times, would not abjure our prayerful cheer,
<dt>But, as at Cana, list with gracious ear
<dt>To us, beseeching, that the Love divine
<dt>May ever at their household table sit,
<dt>Make all His servants who encompass it,
<dt>And change life's bitterest waters into wine.
<p>
<a name=M></a><h2>Michael the Archangel: A Statuette</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>I</h2>
<p>
<dt>My white archangel, with thy steadfast eyes
<dt>Beholding all this empty ghost-filled room,
<dt>Thy clasped hands resting on the sword of doom,
<dt>Thy firm, close lips, not made for human sighs
<dt>Or smiles, or kisses sweet, or bitter cries,
<dt>But for divine exhorting, holy song
<dt>And righteous counsel, bold from seraph tongue.
<dt>Beautiful angel, strong as thou art wise,
<dt>Would that the sight of thee made wise and strong!
<dt>Would that this sheathed sword of thine, which lies
<dt>Stonily idle, could gleam out among
<dt>The spiritual hosts of enemies
<dt>That tempting shriek--"Requite thou wrong with wrong."
<dt>Lama Sabachthani,--How long, how long.
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>II</h2>
<p>
<dt>Michael, the leader of the hosts of God,
<dt>Who warred with Satan for the body of him
<dt>Whom, living, God had loved--If cherubim
<dt>With cherubim contended for one clod
<dt>Of human dust, for forty years that trod
<dt>The gloomy desert of Heaven's chastisement,
<dt>Are there not ministering angels sent
<dt>To battle with the devils that roam abroad,
<dt>Clutching our living souls? "The living, still
<dt>The living, they shall praise Thee!"--Let some great
<dt>Invisible spirit enter in and fill
<dt>The howling chambers of hearts desolate;
<dt>With looks like thine, O Michael, strong and wise,
<dt>My white archangel with the steadfast eyes.
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>Beatrice to Dante</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dd>"Guardami ben. Ben son, ben son." [<a href="#999">*</a>]
<p>
<dt>Regard me well: I am thy love, thy love; 
<dt>Thy blessing, thy delight, thy hope, thy peace: 
<dt>Thy joy above all joys that break and cease 
<dt>When their full waves in widest circles move: 
<dt>Thy bird of comfort, thine eternal dove, 
<dt>Whom thou didst send out of thy mournful breast 
<dt>To flutter back and point thee to thy rest: 
<dt>Thine angel, who forgets her crown star-wove 
<dt>To come to thee with folded woman-hands 
<dt>Pleading,--"look on me, Beatrice, who stands 
<dt>Before thee; by the Triune Light divine 
<dt>Undazzled, still beholds thy human face, 
<dt>And is more happy in this happy place 
<dt>That thou alone art hers and she is thine." 
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>Dante to Beatrice</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I see thee, gliding towards me with slow pace
<dt>Across the azure fields of Paradise,
<dt>Where thine each footstep makes a star arise.
<dt>So from this heart's once void but infinite space
<dt>Each strange sweet touch of thy celestial grace
<dt>In the old mortal life, struck out some spark
<dt>To light the world, though all my heaven lay dark.
<dt>O Beatrice, cypresses enlace
<dt>My laurels: none have grown save tear-bedewed--
<dt>Salt tears that sank into the earth unviewed,
<dt>And sprang up green to form a crown of bays.
<dt>Take it! At thy dear feet I lay my all,
<dt>What men my honors, virtues, glories, call:
<dt>I lived, loved, suffered, sung--for thy sole praise.
<p>
<a name=Q></a><h2>A Question</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>I</h2>
<p>
<dt>Soul, spirit, genius--which thou art--that whence
<dt>I know not, rose upon this mortal frame
<dt>Like the sun o'er the mountains, all aflame,
<dt>Seen large through mists of childish innocence,
<dt>And year by year with me uptravelling thence,
<dt>As hour by hour the day-star, madest aspire
<dt>My nature, interpenetrate with fire
<dt>It felt but understood not--strong, intense,
<dt>Wisdom with folly mixed, and gold with clay;--
<dt>Soul, thou hast journeyed with me all this way.
<dt>Oft hidden and o'erclouded, oft arrayed
<dt>In scorching splendors that my earth-life burned,
<dt>Yet ever unto thee my true life turned,
<dt>For, dim, or clear, 't was thou my daylight made.
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>II</h2>
<p>
<dt>Soul, dwelling oft in God's infinitude, 
<dt>And sometimes seeming no more part of me-- 
<dt>This me, worms' heritage--than that sun can be 
<dt>Part of the earth he has with warmth imbued,-- 
<dt>Whence camest thou? whither goest thou? I, subdued 
<dt>With awe of mine own being--thus sit still, 
<dt>Dumb, on the summit of this lonely hill, 
<dt>Whose dry November-grasses dew-bestrewed 
<dt>Mirror a million suns--That sun, so bright, 
<dt>Passes, as thou must pass, Soul, into night: 
<dt>Art thou afraid, who solitary hast trod 
<dt>A path I know not, from a source to a bourne, 
<dt>Both which I know not? fear'st thou to return 
<dt>Alone, even as thou camest, alone, to God? 
<p>
<a name=A></a><h2>Angel Faces</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dd>"And with the dawn those angel faces smile
<dd>That I have loved long since, and lost awhile."
<p>
<dt><a name=011></a><h2>I</h2>
<p>
<dt>I shall not paint them. God them sees, and I:
<dt>No other can, nor need. They have no form,
<dt>I may not close with human kisses warm
<dt>Their eyes which shine afar or from on high,
<dt>But never will shine nearer till I die.
<dt>How long, how long! See, I am growing old;
<dt>I have quite ceased to note in my hair's fold
<dt>The silver threads that there in ambush lie;
<dt>Some angel faces bent from heaven would pine
<dt>To trace the sharp lines graven upon mine;
<dt>What matter? in the wrinkles ploughed by care
<dt>Let age tread after, sowing immortal seeds;
<dt>All this life's harvest yielded, wheat or weeds,
<dt>Is reaped, methinks: at my little field lies bare.
<p>
<a name=012></a><h2>II</h2>
<p>
<dt>But in the night time, 'twixt it and the stars,
<dt>The angel faces still come glimmering by;
<dt>No death-pale shadow, no averted eye
<dt>Marking the inevitable doom that bars
<dt>Me from them. Not a cloud their aspect mars;
<dt>And my sick spirit walks with them hand in hand
<dt>By the cool waters of a pleasant land:
<dt>Sings with them o'er again, without its jars,
<dt>The psalm of life, that ceased, as one by one
<dt>Their voices, dropping off, left mine alone
<dt>With dull monotonous wail to grieve the air.
<dt>O solitary love, that art so strong,
<dt>I think God will have pity on thee erelong,
<dt>And take thee where thou'lt find those angel faces fair.
<p>
<a name=013></a><h2>Sunday Morning Bells</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>From the near city comes the clang of bells:
<dt>Their hundred jarring diverse tones combine
<dt>In one faint misty harmony, as fine
<dt>As the soft note yon winter robin swells.--
<dt>What if to Thee in Thine Infinity
<dt>These multiform and many-colored creeds
<dt>Seem but the robe man wraps as masquers' weeds
<dt>Round the one living truth Thou givest him--Thee?
<dt>What if these varied forms that worship prove,
<dt>Being heart-worship, reach Thy perfect ear
<dt>But as a monotone, complete and clear,
<dt>Of which the music is, through Christ's name, Love?
<dt>Forever rising in sublime increase
<dt>To "Glory in the Highest,--on earth peace?"

<p>
<a name=014></a><h2>I</h2>
<p>
<dt>Richard the Lion-hearted, crowned serene
<dt>With the true royalty of perfect man;
<dt>Seated in stone above the praise or ban
<dt>Of these mixed crowds who come gaping lean
<dt>As if to see what the word "king" might mean
<dt>In those old times. Behold! what need that rim
<dt>Of crown 'gainst this blue sky, to signal him
<dt>A monarch, of the monarchs that have been,
<dt>And, perhaps, are not?--Read his destinies
<dt>In the full brow o'er-arching kingly eyes,
<dt>In the strong hands, grasping both rein and sword,
<dt>In the close mouth, so sternly beautiful:--
<dt>Surely, a man who his own spirit can rule;
<dt>Lord of himself, therefore his brethren's lord.
<p>
<a name=015></a><h2>II</h2>
<p>
<dt>"O Richard, O mon roi." So minstrels sighed.
<dt>The many-centuried voice dies fast away
<dt>Amidst the turmoil of our modern day.
<dt>How know we but these green-wreathed legends hide
<dt>An ugly truth that never could abide
<dt>In this our living world's far purer air?--
<dt>Nevertheless, O statue, rest thou there,
<dt>Our Richard, of all chivalry the pride;
<dt>Or if not the true Richard, still a type
<dt>Of the old regal glory, fallen, o'er-ripe,
<dt>And giving place to better blossoming:
<dt>Stand--imaging the grand heroic days;
<dt>And let our little children come and gaze,
<dt>Whispering with innocent awe--"This was a King."

<a name=016></a><h2>Guns of Peace</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dd>Sunday Night, March 30th, 1856.
<p>
<dt>Ghosts of dead soldiers in the battle slain,
<dt>Ghosts of dead heroes dying nobler far,
<dt>In the long patience of inglorious war,
<dt>Of famine, cold, heat, pestilence, and pain,--
<dt>All ye whose loss makes our victorious gain--
<dt>This quiet night, as sounds the cannon's tongue,
<dt>Do ye look down the trembling stars among
<dt>Viewing our peace and war with like disdain?
<dt>Or wiser grown since reaching those new spheres,
<dt>Smile ye on those poor bones ye sowed as seed
<dt>For this our harvest, nor regret the deed?--
<dt>Yet lift one cry with us to Heavenly ears--
<dt>"Strike with Thy bolt the next red flag unfurled,
<dt>And make all wars to cease throughout the world."
<p>
<a name=017></a><h2>David's Child</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dd>"Is the child dead?"--And they said, "He is dead."
<p>
<dt>In face of a great sorrow like to death
<dt>How do we wrestle night and day with tears;
<dt>How do we fast and pray; how small appears
<dt>The outside world, while, hanging on some breath
<dt>Of fragile hope, the chamber where we lie
<dt>Includes all space.--But if sudden at last
<dt>The blow falls; or by incredulity
<dt>Fond led, we--never having one thought cast
<dt>Towards years where "the child" was not--see it die,
<dt>And with it all our future, all our past,--
<dt>We just look round us with a dull surprise:
<dt>For lesser pangs we had filled earth with cries
<dt>Of wild and angry grief that would be heard:--
<dt>But when the heart is broken--not a word.
<p>
<a name=018></a><h2>A Word in Season</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>This is a day the Lord hath made."--Thus spake
<dt>The good religious heart, unstained, unworn,
<dt>Watching the golden glory of the morn.--
<dt>Since, on each happy day that came to break
<dt>Like sunlight o'er this silent life of mine,
<dt>Yea, on each beauteous morning I saw shine,
<dt>I have remembered these your words, rejoiced
<dt>And been glad in it. So, o'er many-voiced
<dt>Tumultuous harmonies of tropic seas,
<dt>Which chant an everlasting farewell grand
<dt>Between ourselves and you and the old land,
<dt>Receive this token: many words chance-sown
<dt>May oftentimes have taken root and grown,
<dt>To bear food fruit perennially, like these.
