<p>"Mr. Hallam deserves to be remembered for his own poetic utterances as well as because of his friendship with the present Laureate, and as having been the direct cause of <i>In Memoriam</i>, that most widely read of all English elegiac poems." (<a href="bibliogr.htm#sharp1">Sharp</a>)

<p>
<dt>Even thus, methinks, a city reared should be,
<dt>Yea, an imperial city, that might hold
<dt>Five times an hundred noble towns in fee,
<dt>And either with their might of Babel old,
<dt>Or the rich Roman pomp of empery
<dt>Might stand compare, highest in arts enrolled,
<dt>Highest in arms; brave tenement for the free,
<dt>Who never crouch to thrones, or sin for gold.
<dt>Thus should her towers be raised--with vicinage
<dt>Of clear bold hills, that curve her very streets,
<dt>As if to vindicate 'mid choicest seats
<dt>Of art, abiding Nature's majesty;
<dt>And the broad sea beyond, in calm or rage
<dt>Chainless alike, and teaching Liberty.
