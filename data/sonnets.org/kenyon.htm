<a name=010></a><h2>The Traveller</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When in the dark we slowly drift away
<dt>O'er unknown seas, and busy thoughts at last
<dt>Are quieted, and all the cares are past
<dt>That, bandit-like, infest the realms of day--
<dt>To what pale country does the spirit stray?
<dt>Within what wan-lit land, what region vast,
<dt>Does this strange traveller journey far and fast,
<dt>Till in the east the day breaks cold and gray?
<dt>Ah, tell me, when we slumber, whither goes,
<dt>And whence at waking comes, the silent guest,
<dt>Whose face no man hath seen, whom no man knows--
<dt>The dim familiar of each human breast?
<dt>Behold, at length, when day indeed shall close,
<dt>Will this uneasy traveller, too, have rest?
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Romeo to Juliet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Love, touch my mouth with kisses as with fire;
<dt>Lean hard against my breast, that I may feel
<dt>From thy warm heart its influence subtly steal
<dt>Through all my veins; with overmuch desire
<dt>My spirit fainteth, and my lips suspire
<dt>Swiftly with heavy breathings; round me reel
<dt>The shadows of the dark, and downward wheel
<dt>The dim, far stars from heaven; draw me nigher
<dt>Unto thy bosom, love, for all my sense
<dt>Of earth and time fleets from me. . . Dayward flows
<dt>The stream of night, and into yon immense
<dt>Blue void the slow moon fails; hold me more close,
<dt>Lest from thine arms my spirit hasten hence
<dt>Going that viewless way no mortal knows.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Cleopatra to Anthony</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Go from me now; I will no longer feel
<dt>Your burning kisses on my fevered lips;
<dt>You shall not hold one moment e'en the tips
<dt>Of my shut fingers, though you cry and kneel.
<dt>My face aches, and my tired senses reel;
<dt>Through all my veins a drowsy poison slips;
<dt>My sight grows dim with gradual eclipse,
<dt>For slumber on mine eyes has set his seal.
<dt>Get hence; I will no more to-night; the bars
<dt>Of love are placed against you now: go while
<dt>I hate you not, my Roman; the sick stars
<dt>Wax faint and pallid in the dawn's red smile,
<dt>Look! I am quenched in sleep, as nenuphars
<dt>Are quenched in the broad bosom of the Nile.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>A Sea Grave</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Yea, rock him gently in thine arms, O Deep!
<dt>No nobler heart was ever hushed to rest
<dt>Upon the chill, soft pillow of thy breast--
<dt>No truer eyes didst thou e'er kiss to sleep.
<dt>While o'er his couch the wrathful billows leap,
<dt>And mighty winds roar from the darkened west,
<dt>Still may his head on thy cool weeds be pressed,
<dt>Far down where thou dost endless silence keep.
<dt>Oh, when, slow moving through thy spaces dim
<dt>Some scaly monster seeks its coral cave,
<dt>And pausing o'er the sleeper, stares with grim
<dt>Dull eyes a moment downwards through the wave,
<dt>Then let thy pale green shadows curtain him,
<dt>And swaying sea-flowers hide his lonely grave.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Rizpah</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Blown through the gusty spaces of the night,
<dt>The pale clouds fleet like ghosts along the sky;
<dt>A fitful wind goes moaning feebly by,
<dt>And the faint moon, poised o'er the craggy height,
<dt>Dies in its own uncertain, misty light.
<dt>Within the hills the water-springs are dry;
<dt>The herbs are withered; and the sand-wastes lie
<dt>Dim, wide, and lonely to the weary sight.
<dt>Behold! her awful vigil she will keep
<dt>Through the wan night as through the burning day;
<dt>Though all the world should sleep she will not sleep,
<dt>But watch, wild-eyed and fierce, to scare away,
<dt>As round and round, with hoarse, low cries they creep,
<dt>From her dead sons the hungry beasts of prey.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>My Love Is Like the Vastness of the Sea</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My love is like the vastness of the sea,
<dt>As deep as life, as high as heaven is high,
<dt>And pure as an unclouded summer sky,
<dt>And as enduring as eternity.
<dt>My love is that which was, and is to be,
<dt>Which knows no change, and which can never die;
<dt>Which all the wealth of Ophir could not buy,
<dt>Yet free to <i>one</i> as light and air is free.
<dt>O Love, thou putt'st to shame the nightingale;
<dt>Thy lips, like bees, are fraught with hydromel;
<dt>Than lilies are thy bosom is more pale;
<dt>Thy words are sweeter than a silver bell:
<dt>Yet time from thee thy beauties shall estrange:
<dt>But this my Love can never suffer change.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>Foreshadowings</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lo! in the valley, Love the galingale
<dt>Bends to the blast beside the river-shore,
<dt>And autumn pipes forever more and more,
<dt>While summer's slender voices faint and fail.
<dt>Lo! now the liveried leaf grows sere and pale--
<dt>A phantom of the glory gone before--
<dt>And in the woodland walks we knew of yore
<dt>Long since the songster ceased his tuneful tale.
<dt>Love, let us love; life's summer waneth soon;
<dt>Brief is the splendour of its fervent day:
<dt>For every blood-red rose of balmy June
<dt>Hath burst a tender bud of early May.
<dt>I unto thee would consecrate a boon;
<dt>O shall we love, or shall we still delay?
