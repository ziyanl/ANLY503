<p>
<dt>In Life's dim mists of morning thou dost seem
<dt>To Childhood's eyes a giant vague and vast,
<dt>A shade across the dewy meadow cast
<dt>A blot upon the level-darting beam.
<p>
<dt>Day comes apace, and like a fearful dream
<dt>Thou shrinkest; and Youth smiles, deeming thee past;
<dt>And Manhood recks not of thee; till at last
<dt>Thou comest again, a speck borne down the stream.
<p>
<dt>Larger thou growest, and we see thee now,
<dt>No foe, but one whose silent plying wing
<dt>Shall bear us from the swiftly fading shore;
<dt>Thou comest; our head upon our breast we bow;
<dt>And in our ears remembered voices ring;
<dt>Thy arms enfold us; and we know no more.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>"Farewell"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The mystic berry from the Druid's tree,
<dt>Or limpet from the rock, more easily,
<dt>Or ivy from its mated wall, shall part,
<dt>Than man from whom he loves, than heart from heart.
<dt>Oh the wild ecstasy! the wildering pain!
<dt>To bid adieu; and know that ne'er again
<dt>The hand you hold, the loving voice you hear,
<dt>Shall grasp your own on earth, or charm your ear:
<dt>The lingering clasp of the last fond embrace;
<dt>The lingering gaze on the fast fading face;
<dt>The faltering tongue; the frozen memory;
<dt>The stunning sense of lonely misery;--
<dt>Ah, who shall ever find the words to tell
<dt>The agony of those that take a last farewell?
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>On a Lee Shore</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Let be; of mercy! love, let go the clasp
<dt>Which yet has held thy beauty bound by me,--
<dt>A graceful bark beside a sombre quay--
<dt>Already now the waters sob and gasp
<dt>To dash and crush thee on me, and to grasp
<dt>My tender treasure which by night and day,
<dt>Seen or unseen, against me throbbing lay:
<dt>Near me thou diest: love, let go thy clasp.
<p>
<dt>Spread thy white-bosomed sail unto the breeze;
<dt>And I, like one who waving farewells, stands
<dt>And stretches arms whither arms cannot reach,
<dt>Must yearn to watch thee far upon the seas,
<dt>At ebb across the weary level sands,
<dt>At flood across the weary moaning beach.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>At Dawn</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>One moment, Night fold up thy wings again;
<dt>And cast upon mine eyes the shadow of sleep;
<dt>And in thy breath once more my senses steep;
<dt>And draw once more thy clouds about my brain, 
<dt>Whereon who looketh may forget his pain:
<dt>For floating there even now my Mistress bent
<dt>Her lips towards me, as on speech intent,
<dt>For which my whole soul gasped as flowers for rain.
<p>
<dt>Then at the rustle of thy wings she fled
<dt>Frighted; and, though with hope to stay her flight,
<dt>I thrice called out, she vanished out of sight:
<dt>Bid her return that so her speech be said.
<dt>(The day is up, a voice is in the trees,
<dt>And I am I, and she is over seas.)
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>To Matthew Arnold</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sweet singer, who among thy poet's bays
<dt>Some bitter-fragrant herb has intertwined,
<dt>Who round about thy throbbing lyre dost bind
<dt>Some scent which, stealing with thy happiest lays
<dt>Down to the heart's deep-secret core, doth raise
<dt>A subtle ache their sweetness cannot still,
<dt>A yearning that they cannot all fulfil,
<dt>That lives and sleeps and lives through many days.
<p>
<dt>Though restless youth and age unrested bring
<dt>Their discontents, though many things seem to lie;
<dt>Yet, God be praised, we cannot wholly die
<dt>Whilst such as thou, such as thy father sing,
<dt>And point us still to such landmarks as these,
<dt>Monica, Obermann, Empedocles.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Half-mast High</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The fierce sun smote him and went glorying down,
<dt>And ere the gloaming died his spirit fled;
<dt>The southern night burst into stars o'erhead,
<dt>Nor ruffled any wavelet to a frown;
<dt>Till morning from beneath her golden crown
<dt>Smiled on the half-mast ensign fluttering death
<dt>To beating pulses and to bated breath,
<dt>As if her smile could smile men's sorrow down.
<p>
<dt>Slow tolls the bell, the slow procession creeps;
<dt>Kind women's eyes are wet, hard men's are grave,
<dt>A voice commits our brother to the deeps,
<dt>A plash divides the hollow gulfing wave;
<dt>Still plies the van, still on the vessel speeds;
<dt>Nor ship, nor sea, nor sun, our sorrow heeds.
