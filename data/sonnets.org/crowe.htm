<dt>Ah! where is hid, if still it may survive
<dt>The cankered tooth of age and time's despite,
<dt>Ah! where is hid that orb of glass so bright
<dt>That Merlin for King Ryence did contrive?
<dt>That wondrous orb so bright wherein did live,
<dt>Or ere time had brought them into light,
<dt>The forms of things unborn, which to the sight
<dt>Its high-enchanted power would strangely give!
<p>
<dt>For hope, with counterfeit of this true glass,
<dt>Doth so beguile the lover's easy mind,
<dt>Still turning it to fancy's idiot eye,
<dt>That reason's self forgets her majesty
<dt>To join the gaze; till the fond phantoms pass,
<dt>And grief and stern repentance rise behind.
