<h2>    Penitence</h2>
<p>
<dt>Life is too short, dear love, for unkind feeling,
<dt>Too short for harsh reproach, or bitter tone;
<dt>For us should be but gentle words alone:
<dt>If I have wronged you, dear, here let me kneeling
<dt>Low at your side—in penitence appealing—
<dt>Seek pardon for a fault I had not known,
<dt>Save that my love for you so strong had grown
<dt>It passed the bounds of reason's wise concealing.
<dt>
<dt>Dear love, by all our past of untold gladness,
<dt>By every loving word and fond caress
<dt>Which filled our lives with such sweet happiness,
<dt>Forgive, forget that one brief hour of madness;
<dt>Then may you know the highest joy of living,—
<dt>The God-like peace, the sweetness of forgiving.
<dt>
