<a name=010></a><h2>Echoes of Hellas</h2>
<p>
<dt>O choir of Tempe mute these many years,
<dt>O fountain lutes of lyric Hippocrene,
<dt>On whose polluted brink no Muse is seen.
<dt>No more between the gleaming vales one hears
<dt>Apollo's footfall or the sobbing tears
<dt>Of Daphne, budding finger-tips of green.
<dt>No nymphs are bathing with their huntress Queen
<dt>In the warm shallows of the mountain meres.
<p>
<dt>Great Pan is dead: he perished long ago:
<dt>His reedy pipes these uplands never heard.
<dt>What trembling sounds from yonder coppice come?
<dt>Some ravished queen, who tells the dale her woe?
<dt>Nay, since the maids Pierian here are dumb,
<dt>The nightingale is nothing but a bird.
<p>
<a name=020></a><H2>The Saint and the Sun</H2>
<p>
<dt>I heard a Saint cry to the Sun--"Be dim.
<dt>Why shouldst thou rule on high with boastful ray,
<dt>Till fools adore thee as the God of Day,
<dt>Robbing thy master's honour due to him?"
<dt>But the sun-spirit, thro' each radiant limb
<dt>Translucent as a living ember coal,
<dt>Glowed. At the anger of the seraph soul
<dt>His golden orb trembled from boss to rim.
<p>
<dt>Then made he answer as a dove that sings
<dt>"God's glory is my glory, and my praise
<dt>Only his praising. They, who kneel to me,
<dt>See thro' the waving of my orient wings
<dt>A choir of stars with voices like the sea,
<dt>Singing hosanna in the heavenly ways."
<p>
<a name=030></a><H2>The Two Old Kings</H2>
<p>
<dt>In ruling well what guerdon? Life runs low,
<dt>As yonder lamp upon the hour-glass lies,
<dt>Waning and wasted. We are great and wise,
<dt>But Love is gone; and Silence seems to grow
<dt>Along the misty road where we must go.
<dt>From summits near the morning star's uprise
<dt>Death comes, a shadow from the northern skies,
<dt>As, when all leaves are down, there comes the snow.
<dt>Brother and King, we hold our last carouse.
<dt>One loving-cup we drain and then farewell.
<dt>The night is spent: the crystal morning ray
<dt>Calls us, as soldiers laurell'd on our brows,
<dt>To march undaunted while the clarions swell,
<dt>Heroic hearts, upon our lonely way.
