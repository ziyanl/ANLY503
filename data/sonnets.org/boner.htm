<h2><a name="easter"></a>   Easter Advent</h2>
<p>
<dt>It was a stormy night in early spring.
<dt>Long after sunset pale, green rifts of light
<dt>Gleamed in the west, changing to vitreous white,
<dt>And when these faded, darkness was a thing
<dt>Strangely portentous.&nbsp; There went whirring wing
<dt>Low in the air of birds in furious flight,—
<dt>Wild fowls blown from their courses in the night.
<dt>It was an eve for spectral imaging.
<p></p>     
<dt>A sinless maiden in her chamber high
<dt>That Easter advent midnight heard a call:
<dt>Arise!&nbsp; arise!&nbsp; and startled from her bed
<dt>She saw a glory burst along the sky.
<dt>It lit with flame the cross upon her wall,
<dt>And through the splendor crimson rain was shed.
<dt>
<h2><a name="old" guard></a>The Old Guard</h2>     
<dt>Summer is routed from her rosy plains,
<dt>The splendid queen with colors flying fled
<dt>Far to the south, leaving her legions dead
<dt>Upon the fields all in the dismal rains.
<dt>The minstrels of her camp most plaintive strains
<dt>Piped as they flew.&nbsp; Then vandal armies spread
<dt>About the hills their tattered tents of red
<dt>And gold and purple and their gaudy trains
<p></p>     
<dt>Usurped the valleys, firing as they went,
<dt>Till, halted by a cordon of grim pines
<dt>That would not yield nor furl their banners green.
<dt>Wounded they fought and moaned, though wellnigh spent.
<dt>With blood-drops trickling down their chevron vines
<dt>They fought, and stood—the Old Guard of their queen.
<dt>

Remembrance</h2>
<p></p>         
<dt>
I think that we retain of our dead friends         
<dt>
And absent ones no general portraiture;         
<dt>
That perfect memory does not long endure,         
<dt>
But fades and fades until our own life ends.         
<dt>
Unconsciously, forgetfulness attends         
<dt>
That grief for which there is no other cure,         
<dt>
But leaves of each lost one some record sure,—         
<dt>
 A look, an act, a tone,—something that lends         
<dt>
    Relief and consolation, not regret.         
<dt>
 Even that poor mother mourning her dead child,         
<dt>
  Whose agonizing eyes with tears are wet,         
<dt>
   Whose bleeding heart can not be&nbsp;reconciled         
<dt>
  Unto the grave's embrace,—even she shall yet         
<dt>
  Remember only when her babe first smiled.
