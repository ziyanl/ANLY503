<p>
<dt>Now that the earth has hid her lovely brood
<dt>Of green things in her breast safe out of sight,
<dt>And all the trees have stripped them for the fight,
<dt>The winter comes with wild winds singing rude,
<dt>Hoarse battle songs--so furious in feud
<dt>That nothing lives that has not felt their bite.
<dt>They sound a trumpet in the dead of night
<dt>That makes more solitary solitude.
<p>
<dt>Against the forest doors how fierce they beat!
<dt>Against the porch, against the school-bound boy
<dt>With crimson cheek bent to his shaggy coat.
<dt>The earth is pale but steadfast, hearing sweet
<dt>But far--how far away!--the stream of joy
<dt>Outpouring from a bluebird's tender throat.
<p>

<p>
<dt>O Master-Builder, blustering as you go
<dt>About your giant work, transforming all
<dt>The empty woods into a glittering hall,
<dt>And making lilac lanes and footpaths grow
<dt>As hard as iron under stubborn snow,
<dt>Though every fence stand forth a marble wall,
<dt>And windy hollows drift to arches tall,
<dt>There comes a might that shall your might o'erthrow.
<dt>Build high your white and dazzling palaces,
<dt>Strengthen your bridges, fortify your towers,
<dt>Storm with a loud and a portentious lip;
<dt>And April with a fragmentary breeze,
<dt>And half a score of gentle, golden hours,
<dt>Shall leave no trace of your stern workmanship.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Snow-Storm</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The great, soft, downy snow-storm like a cloak
<dt>Descends to wrap the lean world head to feet;
<dt>It gives the dead another winding-sheet,
<dt>It buries all the roofs until the smoke
<dt>Seems like a soul that from its clay has broke;
<dt>It broods moon-like upon the Autumn wheat,
<dt>And visits all the trees in their retreat,
<dt>To hood and mantle that poor shiv'ring folk.
<dt>With wintry bloom it fills the harshest grooves
<dt>In jagged pine-stump fences. Every sound
<dt>It hushes to the footstep of a nun.
<dt>Sweet Charity! that brightens where it moves,
<dt>Inducing darkest bits of churlish ground
<dt>To give a radiant answer to the sun.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>In the Crowd</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Here in the crowded city's busy street,
<dt>Swayed by the eager, jostling, hasting throng,
<dt>Where Traffic's voice grows harsher and more strong,
<dt>I see within the stream of hurrying feet
<dt>A company of trees in their retreat,
<dt>Dew-bathed, dream-wrapped, and with a thrush's song
<dt>Emparadizing all the place, along
<dt>Whose paths I hear the pulse of Beauty beat.
<dt>'Twas yesterday I walked beneath the trees,
<dt>To-day I tread the city's stony ways;
<dt>And still the spell that o'er my spirit came
<dt>Turns harshest sounds to shy bird ecstasies,
<dt>Pours scent of pine through murky chimney haze,
<dt>And gives each careworn face a woodland frame.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Absence</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Dear grey-winged angel, with the mouth set stern
<dt>And time-devouring eyes, the sweetest sweet
<dt>Of kisses when two severed lovers meet
<dt>Is thine; the cruellest ache in hearts that yearn,
<dt>The fears that freeze, the hopes that leap and burn,
<dt>Thine--thine! And thine the drum-and-trumpet beat
<dt>Of hearts that wait for unreturning feet,
<dt>When comes at last the hour of their return.
<p>
<dt>Of Love's fair ministers thou art the chief.
<dt>To jaded souls, asleep beside their vows,
<dt>Thou givest hopes, keen joys and vague alarms;
<dt>Beneath thy touch the brown and yellow leaf
<dt>Turns to pink blossom, and the spring-bright boughs
<dt>Frame lovers running to each other's arms.
