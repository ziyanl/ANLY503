<a name=010></a><h2>Hawking</h2>
<p>
<dd>"Ariel, my industrious servant!" (<i>The T~empest</i>)
<p>
<dt>Tossed from the falconer's hand, in graceful flight
<dt>Of sweeping circles, see the hawk arise
<dt>In joyful grandeur to her native skies!
<dt>Her bells quick rattling from her airy height,
<dt>While over the head of lady and of knight
<dt>She sails majestic, watchful of the prey,
<dt>With dogs and hunters and the field's array:
<dt>Noble associate! fearful the delight,
<dt>How ardent and how spiritual made
<dt>By her mysterious presence! we attend
<dt>On no dull moving earthiy power for aid,
<dt>A hovering being of the skies our friend;
<dt>So, over the isle his wand the enchanter swayed,
<dt>Proud on his faithful Ariel to depend.
