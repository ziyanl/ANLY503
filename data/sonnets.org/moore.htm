<p>
<dt>Almighty gold! whose magic charms dispense
<dt>Worth to the worthless, to the graceless grace,
<dt>To cowards valour, and to blockheads sense,
<dt>And to the withered maid a Hebe's face,
<dt>Poor love exiled, thou sitst on Hymen's throne;
<dt>Thou rulest the court, the senate, and the bar;
<dt>And though the church thy deity disown,
<dt>Some whisper thou hast priest and altar there.
<dt>All human charities, all laws divine
<dt>Deluded mortals offer at thy shrine;
<dt>O thou supreme, like fate, to kill or save!
<dt>To thy vast empire what is wanting more?
<dt>"Nought," sighs Avaro, "had it but the power
<dt>To silence conscience, and to bribe the grave."
