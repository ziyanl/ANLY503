<p>
<dt>With outstretched whirring wings of van-dyked jet,
<dt>Two crows one day o'er house and pavement pass'd.
<dt>Swift silhouettes limned 'gainst the blue, they glass'd
<dt>Smooth beak and ebon feather in the wet
<dt>Of gaping pool and gutter, while, beset
<dt>By nestward longing, high their hoarse cry cast
<dt>In the face of fickle sun and treacherous blast,
<dt>Till all the City smelt of violet.
<dt>Then through that City quick the news did run.
<dt>Great wheels were slacken'd; belts were stopped in mill,
<dt>And fires in forges. Long ere set of sun
<dt>Dazed men, pale women sought the open hill--
<dt>They throng'd the streets. They caught the clarion cry--
<dt>"Spring has come back--trust Spring to never die!"
<p>

<p>
<dt>Strange, that no idol hath been roughly wrought,
<dt>Or fairly carven, bearing on its base
<dt>A name so potent! Strange, no ancient race,
<dt>Workers in whitest Parian, ever sought
<dt>To reproduce thy beauty, slyly fraught
<dt>With vast suggestion! Strange, thou couldst not brace
<dt>The dull Assyrian, didst not tempt from chase,
<dt>Trophy and battle, the sons of literal thought.
<dt>We who are tired of gods must yet to thee
<dt>Render allegiance. Chance and Love are blind,
<dt>And Cause is soulless, Art is deaf and vain,
<dt>All unavailing looms the God of Pain.
<dt>Disclaiming these, we choose with prescient mind
<dt>The unknown God of Opportunity.
