<p>
<dt>Colin, my dear and most entire beloved
<dt>My muse audacious stoops her pitch to thee,
<dt>Desireing that thy patience be not moved
<dt>By these rude lines, written here you see;
<dt>Fain would my muse, whom cruel love hath wronged,
<dt>Shroud her love-labors under thy protection,
<dt>And I myself with ardent zeal have longed
<dt>That thou mightst know to thee my true affection.
<dt>Therefore, good Colin, graciously accept
<dt>A few sad sonnets which my muse hath framed;
<dt>Though they but newly from the shell are crept,
<dt>Suffer them not by envy to be blamed.
<dt>But underneath the shadow of thy wings
<dt>Give warmth to these young-hatch&eacute;d orphan things.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Feed, silly sheep, although your keeper pineth
<dt>Yet like to Tantalus doth see his food.
<dt>Skip you and leap, no bright Apollo shineth,
<dt>Whilst I bewail my sorrows in yon wood
<dt>Where woeful Philomela doth record,
<dt>And sings with notes of sad and dire lament
<dt>The tragedy wrought by her sister's lord;
<dt>I'll bear a part in her black discontent.
<dt>That pipe which erst was wont to make you glee,
<dt>Upon these downs whereon you careless graze,
<dt>Shall to her mournful music tuned be,
<dt>Let not my plaints, poor lambkins, you amaze;
<dt>There underneath that dark and dusky bower
<dt>Whole showers of tears to Chloris I will pour.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>"Whole showers of tears to Chloris I will pour"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Whole showers of tears to Chloris I will pour
<dt>As true oblations of my sincere love;
<dt>If that will not suffice, most fairest flower,
<dt>Then shall my sighs thee unto pity move.
<dt>If neither tears nor sighs can aught prevail,
<dt>My streaming blood thine anger shall appease;
<dt>This hand of mine by vigor shall assail
<dt>To tear my heart asunder thee to please.
<dt>Celestial powers, on you I invocate:
<dt>You now the chaste affections of my mind,
<dt>I never did my faith yet violate,
<dt>Why should my Chloris then be so unkind?
<dt>That neither tears, nor sighs, nor streaming blood
<dt>Can unto mercy move her cruel mood.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>"When I more large thy praises forth shall show"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When I more large thy praises forth shall show
<dt>That all the world thy beauty shall admire,
<dt>Desiring that most sacred nymph to know
<dt>Which hath the shepherd's fancy set on fire;
<dt>Till then, my dear, let these thine eyes content;
<dt>Till then, fair love, think if I merit favor;
<dt>Till then, oh, let thy merciful assent
<dt>Relish my hopes with some comforting savor.
<dt>So shall you add such courage to my muse
<dt>That she shall climb the steep Parnassus hill,
<dt>That learned poets shall my deeds peruse
<dt>When I from thence obtain&egrave;d have more skill.
<dt>And what I sing shall always be of thee
<dt>As long as life or breath remains in me!
