<h2>Early Aspirations</h2>
<P>
<dt>How many a throb of the young poet-heart,
<dt>Aspiring to the ideal bliss of fame,
<dt>Deems that time soon may sanctify his claim
<dt>Among the sons of song to dwell apart.--
<dt>Time passes--passes! The aspiring flame
<dt>Of hope shrinks down; the white flower poesy
<dt>Breaks on its stalk, and from its earth-turned eye
<dt>Drop sleepy tears instead of that sweet dew
<dt>Rich with inspiring odors, insect wings
<dt>Drew from its leaves with every changing sky,
<dt>While its young innocent petals unsunned grew.
<dt>No more in pride to other ears he sings,
<dt>But with a dying charm himself unto:--
<dt>For a sad season: then, to active life he springs.
</P>
