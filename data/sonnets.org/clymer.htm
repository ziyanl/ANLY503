<h2>    Penelope</h2>
<p>
<dt>Penelope sat weaving all the day
<dt>Her web; and I weave mine of tender thought,
<dt>And many a quaint device by me is wrought
<dt>Of Fancy's golden threads.&nbsp; What will he say
<dt>When he shall come?&nbsp; Will he entreat and pray
<dt>To see the legend?&nbsp; Will his heart be taught
<dt>By it?&nbsp; Night comes and brings me naught;
<dt>I must unweave:&nbsp; Ulysses is away,
<dt>&nbsp;
<dt>But when my hero shall at last have come,
<dt>And his dear eyes have proved my colors true,
<dt>I wonder will my stammering lips be dumb,
<dt>My heart's great love unspoken?&nbsp; Then must you,
<dt>Dear woven thing, help eyes and blushing cheek
<dt>To tell him all I feel, but cannot speak.
