<a name=010></a><h2>Garden Sonnets</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name=011></a><h3>I. Before</h3>
<p>
<dt>All the world was Eden once, you know,
<dt>And Paradise was ours everywhere;
<dt>No jealous hedge joy's limits to declare,
<dt>No sullen wall our Garden-bounds to show;
<dt>No thorns did then beneath the roses grow,
<dt>And winter's blast was as a dream-love's kiss--
<dt>A lightsome rapture; every task a bliss
<dt>Sweet-laden as the air where lilies blow.
<dt>For I was all of Eden to you then,
<dt>And you were all of Paradise to me,
<dt>And each in other all the world were we,
<dt>Till, drenched in golden love-light, we again
<dt>Love-lavish, flung its spell o'er everything,
<dt>And Nature's self lay 'witched within the ring.
<p>
<a name=012></a><h3>II. And After</h3>
<p>
<dt>Where all was Eden, all is Eden-less.
<dt>The Garden vanished--earth and sea and sky,
<dt>The sunbeams, flowers--even as you and I
<dt>All sundered stand in stricken loneliness;
<dt>The tangled Paradise a wilderness
<dt>Of ordered isolations! The great soul,
<dt>Which made of all things one harmonious whole,
<dt>Shredded to serve the fragments which caress
<dt>The separate being they curse! Nought but the Gate
<dt>Remains--fronting our Life as day by day
<dt>It seeks the happiness it cast away
<dt>To snatch a venomed knowledge. Alas! stern fate--
<dt>To find its own discarded innocence
<dt>Become a flaming sword to drive it thence.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Statue of Sorrow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>"Come, build me a statue all of snow!"
<dt>Said the Medici, prince and patron of Art,
<dt>And Michael Angelo, aflame at heart
<dt>With noble shame to cast his visions so,
<dt>In fleeting form for pride's caprices, low:
<dt>His Muse all mutinous humbled to her part,
<dt>And bade a Seraph from the snow out-start.
<dt>He came--and perished in the noon-day glow.
<p>
<dt>Great world! proud patron of th' aspiring mind--
<dt>Dispenser of rewards--thou holdest still
<dt>In thrall, alas! the genius of mankind.
<dt>Exact full toll, but not that he fulfil
<dt>His soul in vanities; nay, rather find
<dt>Best worth in workers who transcend thy will.
