<dt>What honey in the year's last flowers can hide,
<dt>These little butterflies may know:
<dt>With falling leaves they waver to and fro,
<dt>Or on the swinging tops of asters ride.
<dt>But I am weary of the summer's pride
<dt>And sick September's simulated show:
<dt>Why do the colder winds delay to blow
<dt>And bring the pleasant hours that we abide;
<dt>To curtained alcove and sweet household talks,
<dt>Or sweeter silence by our flickering Lars,
<dt>Returning late from Autumn evening walks
<dt>Upon the frosty hills, while reddening Mars
<dt>Hangs low between the withered mullein stalks,
<dt>And upward throngs the host of winter stars!

<dt>The little creek which yesterday I saw
<dt>Ooze through the sedges, and each brackish vein
<dt>That sluiced the marsh, now filled and then again
<dt>Sucked dry to glut the sea's unsated maw,
<dt>All ebb and flow by the same rhythmic law
<dt>That times the beat of the Atlantic main--
<dt>They also fastened to the swift moon's train
<dt>By unseen cords that no less strongly draw.
<dt>So, poet, may thy life's small tributary
<dt>Threading some bitter marsh, obscure, alone,
<dt>Feel yet one pulse with the broad estuary:
<dt>That bears an emperor's fleets through half a zone
<dt>May wait upon the same high luminary
<dt>And pitch its voice to the same ocean's tone.

<p>
<dt>He sang one song and died -- no more but that:
<dt>A single song and carelessly complete.
<dt>He would not bind and thresh his chance-grown wheat,
<dt>Nor bring his wild fruit to the common vat,
<dt>To store the acid rinsings, thin and flat,
<dt>Squeezed from the press or trodden under feet.
<dt>A few slow beads, blood-red and honey-sweet,
<dt>Oozed from the grape, which burst and spilled its fat.
<dt>But Time, who soonest drops the heaviest things
<dt>That weight his pack, will carry diamonds long.
<dt>So through the poets' orchestra, which weaves
<dt>One music from a thousand stops and strings,
<dt>Pierces the note of that immortal song:--
<dt>"High over all the lonely bugle grieves."
