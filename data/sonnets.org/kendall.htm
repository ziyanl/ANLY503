<p>
<dt>I purposed once to take my pen and write,
<dt>Not songs, like some, tormented and awry
<dt>With passion, but a cunning harmony
<dt>Of words and music caught from glen and height,
<dt>And lucid colours born of woodland light
<dt>And shining places where the sea-streams lie.
<dt>But this was when the heat of youth glowed white,
<dt>And since I've put the faded purpose by.
<dt>I have no faultless fruits to offer you
<dt>Who read this book; but certain syllables
<dt>Herein are borrowed from unfooted dells
<dt>And secret hollows dear to noontide dew;
<dt>And these at least, though far between and few,
<dt>May catch the sense like subtle forest spells.

<p>
<dt>So take these kindly, even though there be
<dt>Some notes that unto jother lyres belong,
<dt>Stray echoes from the elder sons of song;
<dt>And think how from its neighbouring native sea
<dt>The pensive shell doth borrow melody.
<dt>I would not do the lordly masters wrong
<dt>By filching fair words from the shining throng
<dt>Whose music haunts me, as the wind a tree.
<dt>Lo, when a stranger in soft Syrian glooms
<dt>Shot through with sunset treads the cedar dells,
<dt>And hears the breezy ring of elfin bells
<dt>Far down by where the white-haired cataract booms,
<dt>He, faint with sweetness caught from forest smells,
<dt>Bears thence, unwitting, plunder of perfumes.

<p>
<dt>Peace hath an altar there. The sounding feet
<dt>Of thunder and the wildering wings of rain
<dt>Against fire-rifted summits flash and beat,
<dt>And through grey upper gorges swoop and strain;
<dt>But round that hallowed mountain-spring remain,
<dt>Year after year, the days of tender heat,
<dt>And gracious nights whose lips with flowers are sweet,
<dt>And filtered lights, and lutes of soft refrain.
<dt>A still, bright pool. To men I may not tell
<dt>The secrets that its heart of water knows,
<dt>The story of a loved and lost repose;
<dt>Yet this I say to cliff and close-leaved dell:
<dt>A fitful spirit haunts yon limpid well,
<dt>Whose likeness is the faithless face of Rose.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Today, while yet the rumour filled the street,
<dt>I left your faces troubled with the thought
<dt>Of brothers to a bodeful fury wrought;
<dt>And, hurrying past a thousand twinkling feet,
<dt>With clouded heart a solitude I sought,
<dt>The haunt of many leaves--a cool retreat--
<dt>And mused of strife with untold interest fraught;
<dt>Of homes; of bloody battles to be fought;
<dt>Nor stirred till night rose stormy, and the deep
<dt>Moaned like some monster shaken in its sleep.
<dt>Then doleful sounds came up from lea and lynn
<dt>Where rain fell heavy on the gloomy deep,
<dt>As if the world, so old and sick of sin,
<dt>Had turned her face into the dark to weep.
