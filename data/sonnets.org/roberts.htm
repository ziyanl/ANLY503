<a name=010></a><h2>The Potato Harvest</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A high bare field, brown from the plough, and borne
<dt>Aslant from sunset; amber wastes of sky
<dt>Washing the ridge; a clamour of crows that fly
<dt>In from the wide flats where the spent tides mourn
<dt>To yon their rocking roosts in pines wind-torn;
<dt>A line of gray snake-fence, that zigzags by
<dt>A pond, and cattle; from the homestead nigh
<dt>The long deep summonings of the supper horn.
<p>
<dt>Black on the ridge, against that lonely flush,
<dt>A cart, and stoop-necked oxen; ranged beside,
<dt>Some barrels; and the day-worn harvest folk,
<dt>Here emptying their baskets, jar the hush
<dt>With hollow thunders; down the dusk hillside
<dt>Lumbers the wain; and day fades out like smoke.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Sower</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A brown sad-coloured hillside, where the soil,
<dt>Fresh from the frequent harrow, deep and fine,
<dt>Lies bare; no break in the remote sky-line,
<dt>Save where a flock of pigeons streams aloft,
<dt>Startled from feed in some low-lying croft,
<dt>Or far-off spires with yellow of sunset shine;
<dt>And here the Sower, unwittingly divine,
<dt>Exerts the silent forethought of his toil.
<p>
<dt>Alone he treads the glebe, his measured stride
<dt>Dumb in the yielding soil; and tho' small joy
<dt>Dwell in his heavy face, as spreads the blind
<dt>Pale grain from his dispensing palm aside,
<dt>This plodding churl grows great in his employ;--
<dt>Godlike, he makes provision for mankind.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Tides</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Through the still dusk how sighs the ebb-tide out
<dt>Reluctant for the reed-beds! Down the sands
<dt>It washes. Hark! Beyond the wan gray strand's
<dt>Low limits how the winding channels grieve,
<dt>Aware the evasive waters soon will leave
<dt>Them void amid the waste of desolate lands,
<dt>Where shadowless to the sky the marsh expands,
<dt>And the noon-heats must scar them, and the drought.
<p>
<dt>Yet soon for them the solacing tide returns
<dt>To quench their thirst of longing. Ah, not so
<dt>Works the stern law our tides of life obey!
<dt>Ebbing in the night-watches swift away,
<dt>Scarce known ere fled for ever is the flow;
<dt>And in parched channel still the shrunk stream mourns.

<p>
<dt>On other fields and other scenes the morn
<dt>Laughs from her blue,--but not such scenes as these,
<dt>Where comes no cheer of summer leaves and bees,
<dt>And no shade mitigates the day's white scorn.
<dt>These serious acres vast no groves adorn;
<dt>But giant trunks, bleak shapes that once were trees,
<dt>Tow'r naked, unassuaged of rain or breeze,
<dt>Their stern grey isolation grimly borne.
<p>
<dt>The months roll over them and mark no change;
<dt>But when spring stirs, or autumn stills, the year,
<dt>Perchance some phantom leafage rustles faint
<dt>Through their parched dreams--some old-time notes ring strange,
<dt>When, in his slender treble, far and clear,
<dt>Reiterates the rain-bird his complaint.
