<P>
<dt>How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,
<dt>Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year!
<dt>My hasting days fly on with full career,
<dt>But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.
<dt>Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,
<dt>That I to manhood am arrived so near,
<dt>And inward ripeness doth much less appear,
<dt>That some more timely-happy spirits <a href="#999">indu'th</a>.
<dt>Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,
<dt>It shall be still in strictest measure even
<dt>To that same lot, however mean or high,
<dt>Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven.
<dt>All is, if I have grace to use it so,
<dt>As ever in my great Task-master's eye.
</P>
<a name=002></a><h2>On His Blindness (<a href="milton.ram"><i>audio</i></a>)</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif" alt="top"></a>
<P>
<dt>When I consider how my light is spent
<dt>Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
<dt>And that one Talent which is death to hide
<dt>Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
<dt>To serve therewith my Maker, and present
<dt>My true account, lest He returning chide,
<dt>"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?"
<dt>I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent
<dt>That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not need
<dt>Either man's work or his own gifts. Who best
<dt>Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state
<dt>Is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed,
<dt>And post o'er land and ocean without rest;
<dt>They also serve who only stand and wait."
</P>

<P>
<dt>Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered Saints, whose bones
<dt>Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold;
<dt>Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old,
<dt>When all our fathers worshiped stocks and stones,
<dt>Forget not: in thy book record their groans
<dt>Who were thy sheep, and in their ancient fold
<dt>Slain by the bloody Piemontese, that rolled
<dt>Mother with infant down the rocks. Their moans
<dt>The vales redoubled to the hills, and they
<dt>To heaven. Their martyred blood and ashes sow
<dt>O'er all the Italian fields, where still doth sway
<dt>The <a href="#999">triple Tyrant</a>; that from these may grow
<dt>A hundredfold, who, having learnt thy way,
<dt>Early may fly the Babylonian woe.
</P>
<a name=004></a><h2>On His Deceased Wife</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif" alt="top"></a>
<P>
<dt>Methought I saw my late espoused saint
<dt>Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,
<dt>Whom Jove's great son to her glad husband gave,
<dt>Rescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.
<dt>Mine, as whom washed from spot of childbed taint
<dt>Purification in the Old Law did save,
<dt>And such as yet once more I trust to have
<dt>Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint,
<dt>Came vested all in white, pure as her mind.
<dt>Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight
<dt>Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined
<dt>So clear as in no face with more delight.
<dt>But, oh! as to embrace me she inclined,
<dt>I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.

<a name=005></a><h2>To the Lord General Cromwell, on the Proposals of Certain Ministers at the Committee for the Propagation of the Gospel</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif" alt="top"></a>
<P>
<dt>Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud
<dt>Not of war only, but detractions rude,
<dt>Guided by faith and matchless fortitude,
<dt>To peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed,
<dt>And on the neck of crowned Fortune proud
<dt>Hast reared God's trophies, and his work pursued,
<dt>While Darwen stream, with blood of Scots imbrued,
<dt>And Dunbar field, resounds thy praises loud,
<dt>And Worcester's laureate wreath: yet much remains
<dt>To conquer still; Peace hath her victories
<dt>No less renowned than War: new foes arise,
<dt>Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains.
<dt>Help us to save free conscience from the paw
<dt>Of hireling wolves, whose Gospel is their maw.
</P>
<a name=006></a><h2>On the Detraction Which Followed 
upon My Writing Certain Treatises</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif" alt="top"></a>
<P>
<dt>A Book was writ of late called Tetrachordon,
<dt>And wov'n close, both matter, form and style;
<dt>The subject new: it walked the town awhile,
<dt>Numb'ring good intellects; now seldom pored on.
<dt>Cries the stall-reader, 'Bless us! what a word on
<dt>A t&#105;tle-page is this!'; and some in file
<dt>Stand spelling false, while one might walk to Mile-
<dt>End Green. Why is it harder, sirs, than Gordon,
<dt>Colkitto, or Macdonnel, or Galasp?
<dt>Those rugged names to our like mouths grow sleek
<dt>That would have made Quintilian stare and gasp.
<dt>Thy age, like ours, O soul of Sir John Cheek,
<dt>Hated not learning worse than toad or asp,
<dt>When thou taught'st Cambridge and King Edward Greek.
</P>
<a name=007></a><h2>On the Religious Memory of Mrs. Catherine Thomson, My Christian Friend, Deceased December 16, 1646</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif" alt="top"></a>
<P>
<dt>When Faith and Love, which parted from thee never,
<dt>Had ripened thy just soul to dwell with God,
<dt>Meekly thou didst resign this earthly load
<dt>Of Death, called Life, which us from Life doth sever.
<dt>Thy works and alms and all thy good endeavour,
<dt>Stayed not behind, nor in the grave were trod;
<dt>But as Faith pointed with her golden rod,
<dt>Followed thee up to joy and bliss for ever.
<dt>Love led them on; and Faith, who knew them best
<dt>Thy handmaids, clad them o'er with purple beams
<dt>And azure wings, that up they flew so drest,
<dt>And spake the truth of thee on glorious themes
<dt>Before the Judge; who thenceforth bid thee rest,
<dt>And drink thy fill of pure immortal streams.
</P>

<a name=008></a><h2>To Cyriack Skinner</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif" alt="top"></a>
<P>
<dt>Cyriack, whose grandsire on the royal bench
<dt>Of British Themis, with no mean applause,
<dt>Pronounced, and in his volumes taught our laws,
<dt>Which others at their bar so often wrench;
<dt>To-day deep thoughts resolve with me to drenchdt
<dt>In mirth, that after no repenting draws;
<dt>Let Euclid rest, and Archimedes pause,
<dt>And what the Swede intend, and what the French.
<dt>To measure life learn thou betimes, and know
<dt>Toward solid good what leads the nearest way;
<dt>For other things mild Heaven a time ordains,
<dt>And disapproves that care, though wise in show,
<dt>That with superfluous burden loads the day,
<dt>And when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.
