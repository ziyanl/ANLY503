<p>
<dt>While soon the "garden's flaunting flowers" decay
<dt>And scattered on the earth neglected lie,
<dt>The mountain-daisy, cherished by the ray
<dt>A poet drew from heaven, shall never die.
<dt>Ah! like that lonely flower the poet
<dt>Mid penury's bare soil and bitter gale
<dt>He felt each storm that on the mountain blows,
<dt>Nor ever knew the shelter of the vale.
<dt>By genius in her native vigour nursed,
<dt>On nature with impassioned look he gazed,
<dt>Then through the cloud of adverse fortune burst
<dt>Indignant, and in light unborrowed blazed.
<dt>Scotia! from rude affliction shield thy bard;
<dt>His heaven-taught numbers fame herself will guard.
