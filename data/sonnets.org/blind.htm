<a name=001></a><h2>Dead Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Mother of the unfortunate, mystic form,
<dt>Who calm, immutable, like oldest fate,
<dt>Sittest, where through the sombre swinging gate
<dt>Moans immemorial life's encircling storm.
<dt>My heart, sore stricken by grief's leaden arm,
<dt>Lags like a weary pilgrim knocking late,
<dt>And sigheth--toward thee staggering with its weight--
<dt>Behold Love conquered by thy son, the worm!
<p>
<dt>He stung him mid the roses' purple bloom,
<dt>The Rose of roses, yea, a thing so sweet,
<dt>Haply to stay blind Change's flying feet,
<dt>And stir with pity the unpitying tomb.
<dt>Here, take him, cold, cold, heavy and void of breath!
<dt>Nor me refuse, O Mother almighty, death.
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>Cleave Thou the Waves</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Cleave thou the waves that weltering to and fro
<dt>Surge multitudinous. The eternal Powers
<dt>Of sun, moon, stars, the air, the hurrying hours,
<dt>The winged winds, the still dissolving show
<dt>Of clouds in calm or storm, for ever flow
<dt>Above thee; while the abysmal sea devours
<dt>The untold dead insatiate, where it lowers
<dt>O'er glooms unfathomed, limitless, below.
<p>
<dt>No longer on the golden-fretted sands,
<dt>Where many a shallow tide abortive chafes,
<dt>Mayst thou delay; life onward sweeping blends
<dt>With far-off heaven: the dauntless one who braves
<dt>The perilous flood with calm unswerving hands,
<dt>The elements sustain: cleave thou the waves.
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>Manchester by Night</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O'er this huge town, rife with intestine wars,
<dt>Whence as from monstrous sacrificial shrines
<dt>Pillars of smoke climb heavenward, Night inclines
<dt>Black brows majestical with glimmering stars.
<dt>Her dewy silence soothes life's angry jars:
<dt>And like a mother's wan white face, who pines
<dt>Above her children's turbulent ways, so shines
<dt>The moon athwart the narrow cloudy bars.
<p>
<dt>Now toiling multitudes that hustling crush
<dt>Each other in the fateful strife for breath
<dt>And, hounded on by diverse hungers, rush
<dt>Across the prostrate ones that groan beneath,
<dt>Are swathed within the universal hush,
<dt>As life exchanges semblances with death.
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>To the Obelisk during the Great Frost, 1881</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou sign-post of the Desert! Obelisk,
<dt>Once fronting in thy monumental pride
<dt>Egypt's fierce sun, that blazing far and wide,
<dt>Sheared her of tree and herb, till like a disk
<dt>Her waste stretched shadowless, and fraught with risk
<dt>To those who with their beasts of burden hied
<dt>Across the seas of sand until they spied
<dt>Thy pillar, and their flagging hearts grew brisk:
<p>
<dt>Now reared beside our Thames so wintry gray,
<dt>Where blocks of ice drift with the drifting stream,
<dt>Thou risest o'er the alien prospect! Say,
<dt>Yon dull, blear, rayless orb whose lurid gleam
<dt>Tinges the snow-draped ships and writhing steam,
<dt>Is this the sun which fired thine orient day?
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>To Memory</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oh in this dearth and winter of the soul,
<dt>When even Hope, still wont to soar and sing,
<dt>Droopeth, a starveling bird whose downy wing
<dt>Stiffens ere dead through the dank drift it fall--
<dt>Yea, ere Hope perish utterly, I call
<dt>On thee, fond Memory, that thou haste and bring
<dt>One leaf, one blossom from that far-off spring
<dt>When love's auroral light lay over all.
<p>
<dt>Bring but one pansy: haply so the thrill
<dt>Of poignant yearning for those glad dead years
<dt>May, like the gutsy south, breathe o'er the chill
<dt>Of frozen grief, dissolving it in tears,
<dt>Till numb Hope, stirred by that warm dropping rain,
<dt>Will deem, perchance, Love's springtide come again.
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>Despair</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thy wings swoop darkening round my soul, Despair!
<dt>And on my brain thy shadow seems to brood
<dt>And hem me round with stifling solitude,
<dt>With chasms of vacuous gloom which are thy lair.
<dt>No light of human joy, no song or prayer,
<dt>Breaks ever on this chaos, all imbrued
<dt>With heart's-blood trickling from the multitude
<dt>Of sweet hopes slain, or agonizing there.
<p>
<dt>Lo, wilt thou yield thyself to grief, and roll
<dt>Vanquished from thy high seat, imperial brain;
<dt>And abdicating turbulent life's control,
<dt>Be dragged a captive bound in sorrow's chain?
<dt>Nay! though my heart is breaking with its pain,
<dt>No pain on earth has power to crush my soul.
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>Sleep</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Love-cradling Night, lit by the lucent moon,
<dt>Most pitiful and mother-hearted Night!
<dt>Blest armistice in life's tumultuous fight,
<dt>Resolving discords to a spheral tune!
<dt>When tired with heat and strenuous toil of noon,
<dt>With ceaseless conflict betwixt might and right,
<dt>With ebb and flow of sorrow and delight,
<dt>Our panting hearts beneath their burdens swoon,
<p>
<dt>To thee, O star-eyed comforter, we creep,
<dt>Earth's ill-used step-children to thee make moan,
<dt>As hiding in thy dark skirts' ample sweep;
<dt>--Poor debtors whose brief life is not their own;
<dt>For dunned by Death, to whom we owe its loan,
<dt>Give us, O Night, the interest paid in sleep.
<p>
<a name=101></a><h2>Hope</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>All treasures of the earth and opulent seas,
<dt>Metals and odorous woods and cunning gold,
<dt>Fowls of the air and furry beasts untold,
<dt>Vineyards and harvest fields and fruitful trees
<dt>Nature gave unto Man; and last her keys
<dt>Vouched passage to her secret ways of old
<dt>Whence knowledge should be wrung, nay power to mould
<dt>Out of the rough, his occult destinies.
<p>
<dt>But tired of these he craved a wider scope:
<dt>Then fair as Pallas from the brain of Jove
<dt>From his deep wish there sprang, full-armed, to cope
<dt>With all life's ills, even very death in love,
<dt>The only thing man never wearies of--
<dt>His own creation--visionary Hope.
<p>
<a name=102></a><h2>The Dead</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The dead abide with us! Though stark and cold
<dt>Earth seems to grip them, they are with us still:
<dt>They have forged our chains of being for good or ill;
<dt>And their invisible hands these hands yet hold.
<dt>Our perishable bodies are the mould
<dt>In which their strong imperishable will--
<dt>Mortality's deep yearning to fulfil--
<dt>Hath grown incorporate through dim time untold.
<p>
<dt>Vibrations infinite of life in death,
<dt>As a star's travelling light survives its star!
<dt>So may we hold our lives, that when we are
<dt>The fate of those who then will draw this breath,
<dt>They shall not drag us to their judgment bar,
<dt>And curse the heritage which we bequeath.
<p>
<a name=103></a><h2>Time's Shadow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thy life, O Man, in this brief moment lies:
<dt>Time's narrow bridge whereon we darkling stand,
<dt>With an infinitude on either hand
<dt>Receding luminously from our eyes.
<dt>Lo, there thy Past's forsaken Paradise
<dt>Subsideth like some visionary strand,
<dt>While glimmering faint, the Future's promised land,
<dt>Illusive from the abyss, seems fain to rise.
<p>
<dt>This hour alone Hope's broken pledges mar,
<dt>And joy now gleams before, now in our rear,
<dt>Like mirage mocking in some waste afar,
<dt>Dissolving into air as we draw near.
<dt>Beyond our steps the path is sunny-clear,
<dt>The shadow lying only where we are.
<p>
<a name=104></a><h2>A Symbol</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Hurrying for ever in their restless flight
<dt>The generations of earth's teeming womb
<dt>Rise into being and lapse into the tomb
<dt>Like transient bubbles sparkling in the light;
<dt>They sink in quick succession out of sight
<dt>Into the thick insuperable gloom
<dt>Our futile lives in flashing by illume--
<dt>Lightning which mocks the darkness of the night.
<p>
<dt>Nay--but consider, though we change and die,
<dt>If men must pass shall Man not still remain?
<dt>As the unnumbered drops of summer rain
<dt>Whose changing particles unchanged on high,
<dt>Fixed, in perpetual motion, yet maintain
<dt>The mystic bow emblazoned on the sky.
<p>
<a name=105></a><h2>Suffering</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oh ye, all ye, who suffer here below,
<dt>Schooled in the baffling mystery of pain,
<dt>Who on life's anvil bear the fateful strain,
<dt>Wrong as forged iron, hammered blow on blow.
<dt>Take counsel with your grief, in that you know,
<dt>That he who suffers suffers not in vain,
<dt>Nay, that it shall be for the whole world's gain,
<dt>And wisdom prove the priceless price of woe.
<p>
<dt>Thus in some new-found land where no man's feet
<dt>Have trod a path, bold voyagers astray,
<dt>May fall foredone by torturing thirst and heat:
<dt>But from the impotent body of defeat--
<dt>The winners spring who carve a conquering way--
<dt>Measured by milestones of their perished clay.
<p>
<a name=106></a><h2>Analkh</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Like a great rock which looming o'er the deep
<dt>Casts his eternal shadow on the strands,
<dt>And veiled in cloud inexorably stands,
<dt>While vaulting round his adamantine steep
<dt>Embattled breakers clamorously leap,
<dt>Sun-garlanded and hope-uplifted bands,
<dt>But soon with waters shattered in the sands
<dt>Slowly recoiling back to ocean creep:
<p>
<dt>So sternly dost thou tower above us, Fate!
<dt>For still our eager hearts exultant beat,
<dt>Borne in the hurrying tide of life elate,
<dt>And dashing break against thy marble feet 
<dt>But would Hope's rainbow-aureole round us fleet,
<dt>Without these hurtling shocks of man's estate?
<p>
<a name=107></a><h2>Saving Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Would we but love what will not pass away!
<dt>The sun that on each morning shines as clear
<dt>As when it rose first on the world's first year;
<dt>The fresh green leaves that rustle on the spray.
<dt>The sun will shine, the leaves will be as gay
<dt>When graves are full of all our hearts held dear,
<dt>When not a soul of those who loved us here,
<dt>Not one, is left us--creatures of decay.
<p>
<dt>Yea, love the Abiding in the Universe
<dt>Which was before, and will be after us.
<dt>Nor yet for ever hanker and vainly cry
<dt>For human love--the beings that change or die;
<dt>Die--change--forget: to care so is a curse,
<dt>Yet cursed we'll be rather than not care thus.
<p>
<a name=108></a><h2>Haunted Streets</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lo, haply walking in some clattering street--
<dt>Where throngs of men and women dumbly pass,
<dt>Like shifting pictures seen within a glass
<dt>Which leave no trace behind--one seems to meet,
<dt>In roads once trodden by our mutual feet,
<dt>A face projected from that shadowy mass
<dt>Of faces, quite familiar as it was,
<dt>Which beaming on us stands out clear and sweet.
<p>
<dt>The face of faces we again behold
<dt>That lit our life when life was very fair,
<dt>And leaps our heart toward eyes and mouth and hair:
<dt>Oblivious of the undying love grown cold,
<dt>Or body sheeted in the churchyard mould,
<dt>We stretch out yearning hands and grasp--the air.
<p>
<a name=109></a><h2>Motherhood</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>From out the front of being, undefiled,
<dt>A life hath been upheaved with struggle and pain;
<dt>Safe in her arms a mother holds again
<dt>That dearest miracle--a new-born child.
<dt>To moans of anguish terrible and wild--
<dt>As shrieks the night-wind through an ill-shut pane--
<dt>Pure heaven succeeds; and after fiery strain
<dt>Victorious woman smiles serenely mild.
<p>
<dt>Yea, shall she not rejoice, shall not her frame
<dt>Thrill with a mystic rapture! At this birth,
<dt>The soul now kindled by her vital flame
<dt>May it not prove a gift of priceless worth?
<dt>Some saviour of his kind whose starry fame
<dt>Shall bring a brightness to the darkened earth.
<p>
<a name=110></a><h2>The After-Glow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It is a solemn evening, golden-clear--
<dt>The Alpine summits flame with rose-lit snow
<dt>And headlands purpling on wide seas below,
<dt>And clouds and woods and arid rocks appear
<dt>Dissolving in the sun's own atmosphere
<dt>And vast circumference of light, whose slow
<dt>Transfiguration--glow and after-glow--
<dt>Turns twilight earth to a more luminous sphere.
<p>
<dt>Oh heart, I ask, seeing that the orb of day
<dt>Has sunk below, yet left to sky and sea
<dt>His glory's spiritual after-shine:
<dt>I ask if Love, whose sun hath set for thee,
<dt>May not touch grief with his memorial ray,
<dt>And lend to loss itself a joy divine?

<p>(See Wordsworth's <li><a href="http://utl1.library.utoronto.ca/disk1/www/documents/utel/rp/poems/wordswor16.html">It Is a Beauteous Evening, Calm and Free</a>.)
<p>
<a name=111></a><h2>The Red Sunsets, 1883 (1)</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The twilight heavens are flushed with gathering light,
<dt>And o'er wet roofs and huddling streets below
<dt>Hang with a strange Apocalyptic glow
<dt>On the black fringes of the wintry night.
<dt>Such bursts of glory may have rapt the sight
<dt>Of him to whom on Patmos long ago
<dt>The visionary angel came to show
<dt>That heavenly city built of chrysolite.
<p>
<dt>And lo, three factory hands begrimed with soot,
<dt>Aflame with the red splendour, marvelling stand,
<dt>And gaze with lifted faces awed and mute.
<dt>Starved of earth's beauty by Man's grudging hand,
<dt>O toilers, robbed of labour's golden fruit,
<dt>Ye, too, may feast in Nature's fairyland.
<p>
<a name=112></a><h2>The Red Sunsets, 1883 (2)</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The boding sky was charactered with cloud,
<dt>The scripture of the storm--but high in air,
<dt>Where the unfathomed zenith still was bare,
<dt>A pure expanse of rose-flushed violet glowed
<dt>And, kindling into crimson light, o'erflowed
<dt>The hurrying wrack with such a blood-red glare,
<dt>That heaven, igniting, wildly seemed to flare
<dt>On the dazed eyes of many an awe-struck crowd.
<p>
<dt>And in far lands folk presaged with blanched lips
<dt>Disastrous wars, earthquakes, and foundering ships,
<dt>Such whelming floods as never dykes could stem,
<dt>Or some proud empire's ruin and eclipse:
<dt>Lo, such a sky, they cried, as burned o'er them
<dt>Once lit the sacking of Jerusalem!
<p>
<a name=113></a><h2>The Sleeping Beauty</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There was intoxication in the air;
<dt>The wind, keen blowing from across the seas,
<dt>O'er leagues of new-ploughed land and heathery leas,
<dt>Smelt of wild gorse whose gold flamed everywhere.
<dt>And undertone of song pulsed far and near,
<dt>The soaring larks filled heaven with ecstasies,
<dt>And, like a living clock among the trees,
<dt>The shouting cuckoo struck the time of year.
<p>
<dt>For now the Sun had found the earth once more,
<dt>And woke the Sleeping Beauty with a kiss;
<dt>Who thrilled with light of love in every pore,
<dt>Opened her flower-blue eyes, and looked in his.
<dt>Then all things felt life fluttering at their core--
<dt>The world shook mystical in lambent bliss.
<p>
<a name=114></a><h2>The Robin Redbreast</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The year's grown songless! No glad pipings thrill
<dt>The hedge-row elms, whose wind-worn branches shower
<dt>Their leaves on the sere grass, where some late flower
<dt>In golden chalice hoards the sunlight still.
<dt>Our summer guests, whose raptures used to fill
<dt>Each apple-blossomed garth and honeyed bower,
<dt>Have in adversity's inclement hour
<dt>Abandoned us to bleak November's chill.
<p>
<dt>But hearken! Yonder russet bird among
<dt>The crimson clusters of the homely thorn
<dt>Still bubbles o'er with little rills of song--
<dt>A blending of sweet hope and resignation:
<dt>Even so, when life of love and youth is shorn,
<dt>One friend becomes its last, best consolation.
<p>
<a name=115></a><h2>A Winter Landscape</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>All night, all day, in dizzy, downward flight,
<dt>Fell the wild-whirling, vague, chaotic snow,
<dt>Till every landmark of the earth below,
<dt>Trees, moorlands, roads, and each familiar sight
<dt>Were blotted out by the bewildering white.
<dt>And winds, now shrieking loud, now whimpering low,
<dt>Seemed lamentations for the world-old woe
<dt>That death must swallow life, and darkness light.
<p>
<dt>But all at once the rack was blown away,
<dt>The snowstorm hushing ended in a sigh;
<dt>Then like a flame the crescent moon on high
<dt>Leaped forth among the planets; pure as they,
<dt>Earth vied in whiteness with the Milky Way:
<dt>Herself a star beneath the starry sky.
<p>
<a name=116></a><h2>On the Lighthouse at Antibes</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A stormy light of sunset glows and glares
<dt>Between two banks of cloud, and o'er the brine
<dt>Thy fair lamp on the sky's carnation line
<dt>Alone on the lone promontory flares:
<dt>Friend of the Fisher who at nightfall fares
<dt>Where lurk false reefs masked by the hyaline
<dt>Of dimpling waves, within whose smile divine
<dt>Death lies in wait behind Circean snares.
<p>
<dt>The evening knows thee ere the evening star;
<dt>Or sees that flame sole Regent of the bight,
<dt>When storm, hoarse rumoured by the hills afar,
<dt>Makes mariners steer landward by thy light,
<dt>Which shows through shock of hostile nature's war
<dt>How man keeps watch o'er man through deadliest night.
<p>
<a name=117></a><h2>Beauty</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Even as on some black background full of night
<dt>And hollow storm in cloudy disarray,
<dt>The forceful brush of some great master may
<dt>More brilliantly evoke a higher light;
<dt>So beautiful, so delicately white,
<dt>So like a very metaphor of May,
<dt>Your loveliness on my life's sombre grey
<dt>In its perfection stands out doubly bright.
<p>
<dt>And yet your beauty breeds a strange despair,
<dt>And pang of yearning in the helpless heart;
<dt>To shield you from time's fraying wear and tear,
<dt>That from yourself yourself would wrench apart,
<dt>How save you, fairest, but to set you where
<dt>Mortality kills death in deathless art?
<p>
<a name=118></a><h2>In the St. Gotthardt Pass</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The storm which shook the silence of the hills
<dt>And sleeping pinnacles of ancient snow
<dt>Went muttering off in one last thunder throe
<dt>Mixed with a moan of multitudinous rills;
<dt>Yea, even as one who has wept much, but stills
<dt>The flowing tears of some convulsive woe
<dt>When a fair light of hope begins to glow
<dt>Athwart the gloom of long remembered ills:
<p>
<dt>So does the face of this scarred mountain height
<dt>Relax its stony frown, while slow uprolled
<dt>Invidious mists are changed to veiling gold.
<dt>Wild peaks still fluctuate between dark and bright,
<dt>But when the sun laughs at them, as of old,
<dt>They kiss high heaven in all embracing light.
<p>
<a name=119></a><h2>On the Riviera</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In tortuous windings up the steep incline
<dt>The sombre street toils to the village square,
<dt>Whose antique walls in stone and moulding bear
<dt>Dumb witness to the Moor. Afar off shine,
<dt>With tier on tier, cutting heaven's blue divine,
<dt>The snowy Alps; and lower the hills are fair,
<dt>With wave-green olives rippling down to where
<dt>Gold clusters hang and leaves of sunburnt vine.
<p>
<dt>You may perchance, I never shall forget
<dt>When, between twofold glory of land and sea,
<dt>We leant together o'er the old parapet,
<dt>And saw the sun go down. For, oh, to me,
<dt>The beauty of that beautiful strange place
<dt>Was its reflection beaming from your face.
<p>
<a name=120></a><h2>Heart's-Ease</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As opiates to the sick on wakeful nights,
<dt>As light to flowers, as flowers in poor men's rooms,
<dt>As to the fisher when the tempest glooms
<dt>The cheerful twinkling of his village lights;
<dt>As emerald isles to flagging swallow flights,
<dt>As roses garlanding with tendrilled blooms
<dt>The unweeded hillocks of forgotten tombs,
<dt>As singing birds on cypress-shadowed heights,
<p>
<dt>Thou art to me--a comfort past compare--
<dt>For thy joy-kindling presence, sweet as May,
<dt>Sets all my nerves to music, makes away
<dt>With sorrow and the numbing frost of care,
<dt>Until the influence of thine eyes' bright sway
<dt>Has made life's glass go up from foul to fair.

<a name=121></a><h2>Untimely Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Peace, throbbing heart, nor let us shed one tear
<dt>O'er this late love's unseasonable glow;
<dt>Sweet as a violet blooming in the snow,
<dt>The posthumous offspring of the widowed year
<dt>That smells of March when all the world is sere,
<dt>And, while around the hurtling sea-winds blow--
<dt>Which twist the oak and lay the pine tree low--
<dt>Stands childlike in the storm and has no fear.
<p>
<dt>Poor helpless blossom orphaned of the sun,
<dt>How could it thus brave winter's rude estate?
<dt>Oh love, more helpless, why bloom so late,
<dt>Now that the flower-time of the year is done?
<dt>Since thy dear course must end when scarce begun,
<dt>Nipped by the cold touch of relentless fate.
<p>
<a name=122></a><h2>The Passing Year</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>No breath of wind stirs in the painted leaves,
<dt>The meadows are as stirless as the sky,
<dt>Like a Saint's halo golden vapours lie
<dt>Above the restful valley's garnered sheaves.
<dt>The journeying Sun, like one who fondly grieves,
<dt>Above the hills seems loitering with a sigh,
<dt>As loth to bid the fruitful earth good-bye,
<dt>On these hushed hours of luminous autumn eves.
<p>
<dt>There is a pathos in his softening glow,
<dt>Which like a benediction seems to hover
<dt>O'er the tranced earth, ere he must sing below
<dt>And leave her widowed of her radiant Lover,
<dt>A frost-bound sleeper in a shroud of snow,
<dt>While winter winds howl a wild dirge above her.
<p>
<a name=123></a><h2>Christmas Eve</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Alone--with one fair star for company,
<dt>The loveliest star among the hosts of night,
<dt>While the grey tide ebbs with the ebbing light--
<dt>I pace along the darkening wintry sea.
<dt>Now round the yule-log and the glittering tree
<dt>Twinkling with festive tapers, eyes as bright
<dt>Sparkle with Christmas joys and young delight,
<dt>As each one gathers to his family.
<p>
<dt>But I--a waif on earth where'er I roam--
<dt>Uprooted with life's bleeding hopes and fears
<dt>From that one heart that was my heart's sole home,
<dt>Feel the old pang pierce through the severing years,
<dt>And as I think upon the years to come
<dt>That fair star trembles through my falling tears.
<p>
<a name=124></a><h2>The Evening of the Year</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Wan mists enwrap the still-born day;
<dt>The harebell withers on the heath;
<dt>And all the moorland seems to breathe
<dt>The hectic beauty of decay.
<dt>Within the open grave of May
<dt>Dishevelled trees drop wreath on wreath;
<dt>Wind-wrung and ravelled underneath
<dt>Waste leaves choke up the woodland way.
<p>
<dt>The grief of many partings near
<dt>Wails like an echo in the wind:
<dt>The days of love lie far behind,
<dt>The days of loss lie shuddering near.
<dt>Life's morning-glory who shall bind?
<dt>It is the evening of the year.
<p>
<a name=125></a><h2>New Year's Eve</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Another full-orbed year hath waned to-day,
<dt>And set in the irrevocable past,
<dt>And headlong whirled long Time's winged blast
<dt>My fluttering rose of youth is borne away:
<dt>Ah rose once crimson with the blood of May,
<dt>A honeyed haunt where bees would break their fast,
<dt>I watch thy scattering petals flee aghast,
<dt>And all the flickering rose-lights turning grey.
<p>
<dt>Poor fool of life! plagued ever with thy vain
<dt>Regrets and futile longings! were the years
<dt>Not cups o'erbrimming still with gall and tears?
<dt>Let go thy puny personal joy and pain!
<dt>If youth with all its brief hope disappears,
<dt>To deathless hope we must be born again.
<p>
<a name=126></a><h2>Nirvana</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Divest thyself, O Soul, of vain desire!
<dt>Bid hope farewell, dismiss all coward fears;
<dt>Take leave of empty laughter, emptier tears,
<dt>And quench, for ever quench, the wasting fire
<dt>Wherein this heart, as in a funeral pyre,
<dt>Aye burns, yet is consumed not. Years on years
<dt>Moaning with memories in thy maddened ears--
<dt>Let at thy word, like refluent waves, retire.
<p>
<dt>Enter thy soul's vast realm as Sovereign Lord,
<dt>And, like that angel with the flaming sword,
<dt>Wave off life's clinging hands. Then chains will fall
<dt>From the poor slave of self's hard tyranny--
<dt>And Thou, a ripple rounded by the sea,
<dt>In rapture lost be lapped within the All.
