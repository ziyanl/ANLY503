<h3>"Non vi si pensa quanto sangue costa." --Paradiso xxix, 91.</h3>
<p>
<dt>The soldier fought his battle silently.
<dt>Not his the strife that stays for set of sun;
<dt>It seemed this warefare never might be done;
<dt>Through glaring day and blinding night fought he.
<dt>There came no hand to help, no eye to see;
<dt>No herald's voice proclaimed the fight begun;
<dt>No trumpet, when the bitter field was won,
<dt>Sounded abroad the soldier's victory.
<dt>As if the struggle had been light, he went,
<dt>Gladly, life's common road a little space;
<dt>Nor any knew how his heart's blood was spent;
<dt>Yet there were some who after testified
<dt>They saw a glory grow upon his face;
<dt>And all men praised the soldier when he died.
<p>
<a name=075></a><h2>A Friendship</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Small fellowship of daily commonplace
<dt>We hold together, dear, constrained to go
<dt>Diverging ways. Yet day by day I know
<dt>My life is sweeter for thy life's sweet grace;
<dt>And if we meet but for a moment's space,
<dt>Thy touch, thy word, sets all the world aglow.
<dt>Faith soars serener, haunting doubts shrink low,
<dt>Abashed before the sunshine of thy face.

<p>Nor press of crowd, nor waste of distance serves
<dt>To part us. Every hush of evening brings
<dt>Some hint of thee, true-hearted friend of mine;
<dt>And as the farther planet thrills and swerves
<dt>When towards it through the darkness Saturn swings,
<dt>Even so my spirit feels the spell of thine.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>Separation</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Along the Eastern shore the low waves creep,
<dt>Making a ceaseless music on the sand,
<dt>A song that gulls and curlews understand,
<dt>The lullaby that sings the day to sleep.
<dt>A thousand miles afar, the grim pines keep
<dt>Unending watch upon a shoreless land,
<dt>Yet through their tops, swept by some wizard hand,
<dt>The sound of surf comes singing up the steep.

<p>Sweet, thou canst hear the tidal litany;
<dt>I, mid the pines land-wearied, may but dream
<dt>Of the far shore; but though the distance seem
<dt>Between us fixed, impassable, to me
<dt>Cometh thy soul’s voice, chanting love’s old theme,
<dt>And mine doth answer, as the pines the sea.
<p>
<a name=150></a><h2>Absent</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My friend, I need thee in good days or ill,
<dt>I need the counsel of thy larger thought;
<dt>And I would question all the year has brought--
<dt>What spoil of books, what victories of will;
<dt>But most I long for the old wordless thrill,
<dt>When on the shore, like children picture-taught,
<dt>We watched each miracle the sweet day wrought,
<dt>While the tide ebbed, and every wind was still.

<p>Dear, let it be again as if we mused,
<dt>We two, with never need of spoken word
<dt>(While the sea’s fingers twined among the dulse,
<dt>And gulls dipped near), our spirits seeming fused
<dt>In the great Life that quickens wave and bird,
<dt>Our hearts in happy rhythm with the world-pulse.
<p>
<p>
<a name=151></a><h2>Thus Far</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Because my life has lain so close to thine,
<dt>Because our hearts have kept a common beat,
<dt>Because thine eyes turned towards me frank and sweet,
<dt>Reveal sometimes thine untold thoughts to mine,
<dt>Think not that I, by curious design,
<dt>Or over-step of too impetuous feet,
<dt>Could desecrate thy soul’s supreme retreat,
<dt>Could disregard its quivering barrier-line.

<p>Only a simple Levite, I, who stand
<dt>On the world’s side of the most holy place,
<dt>Till, as the new day glorifies the east,
<dt>One come to lift the veil with reverent hand,
<dt>And enter with thy soul’s soul face to face,--
<dt>He whom thy God shall call to be high priest.
<p>
<a name=160></a><h2>Thoughts</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The morning brought a stranger to my door,
<dt>I know not whence such feet as his may stray,
<dt>From what still heights, along what star-set way,
<dt>A child he seemed, yet my eyes fell before
<dt>His eyes Olympian.  I did implore
<dt>Him enter, linger but one golden day
<dt>To bless my house. He passed, he might not stay,
<dt>And though I call with tears, he comes no more.
<p>
<dt>At noon there stole a beggar to my gate,
<dt>Of subtle tongue, the porter he beguiled.
<dt>His creeping, evil steps my house defiled.
<dt>I flung him scornful alms, I bade him straight
<dt>To leave me. Swift he clutched my fee and smiled,
<dt>Yet went not forth, nor goes, despite my hate.
<p>
<a name=170></a><h2>Christmas</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The Christmas bells ring discord overhead;
<dt>The angel-song fell silent long ago;
<dt>Nor seer, nor silly shepherd comes, star-led,
<dt>To kneel to-night beside a baby’s bed.
<dt>Peace is not yet, and wrong and want and woe
<dt>Cry in the streets, and love is slow,
<dt>And sin is sleek and swift and housed and fed.

<p>Dear Lord, our faith is faint, our hearts are sore;
<dt>Our prayers are as complaints, our songs as cries;
<dt>Fain would we hear the angel-voice once more,
<dt>And see the Star still lead along the skies;
<dt>Fain would, like sage and simple folk of yore,
<dt>Watch where the Christ-child smiles in Mary’s eyes.

<h3>Died September 7, 1881</h3>
<p>
<dt>The Southwind brought a voice; was it of bird?
<dt>Or faint-blown reed? or string that quivered long?
<dt>A haunting voice that woke into a song
<dt>Sweet as a child’s low laugh, or lover’s word.
<dt>We listened idly till it grew and stirred
<dt>With throbbing chords of joy, of love, of wrong;
<dt>A mighty music, resonant and strong;
<dt>Our hearts beat higher for that voice far-heard.

<p>The Southwind brought a shadow, purple-dim,
<dt>It swept across the warm smile of the sun;
<dt>A sudden shiver passed on field and wave;
<dt>The grasses grieved along the river’s brim.
<dt>We knew the voice was silent, the song done;
<dt>We knew the shadow smote across a grave.
