<p>
<dt>Not Spring--too lavish of her bud and leaf--
<dt>But Autumn, with sad eyes and brow austere,
<dt>When fields are bare, and woods are brown and sere,
<dt>And leaden skies weep their exhaustless grief.
<dt>Spring is so much too bright, since Spring is brief.
<dt>And in our hearts is Autumn all the year,
<dt>Least sad when the wide pastures are most drear,
<dt>And fields grieve most robbed of the last gold sheaf.
<p>
<dt>For when the plough goes down the brown wet field
<dt>A delicate doubtful throb of hope is ours--
<dt>What if this coming Spring at last should yield
<dt>Joy, with her too profuse unasked-for flowers?
<dt>Not all our Springs of commonplace and pain
<dt>Have taught us now that Autumn hope is vain.

<p>
<dt>Not Summer's crown of scent the red rose weaves,
<dt>Not hawthorn perfume blown o'er bloom-strewn grass,
<dt>Not violets' whispers as the children pass,
<dt>Nor new-mown hay, crisp scent of yellow sheaves,
<dt>Nor lilac perfume in the soft May eves,
<dt>Nor any scent that Springtime can amass,
<dt>Or Summer squander, such a magic has
<dt>As scent of fresh wet earth and fallen leaves.
<p>
<dt>For sometimes lovers, in November days,
<dt>When earth is grieving for the vanished sun,
<dt>Have trod dead leaves in chill and wintry ways,
<dt>And kissed and dreamed eternal summer won.
<dt>Look back, look back! through memory's deepening haze,
<dt>See--two who dreamed that dream, and you were one!

<h3>I.  Night</h3>
<p>
<dt>While yet the woods were hardly more than brown,
<dt>Filled with the stillness of the dying day
<dt>The folds and farms and faint green pastures lay,
<dt>And bells chimed softly from the gray-walled town.
<dt>The dark fields with the corn and poppies sown,
<dt>The dark delicious dreamy forest way,
<dt>The hope of April for the soul of May--
<dt>On all of these night's wide soft wings swept down.
<p>
<dt>One yellow star pierced through the clear, pure sky,
<dt>And showed above the network of the wood,
<dt>The silence of whose crowded solitude
<dt>Was broken but by little woodland things
<dt>Rustling dead leaves with restless feet and wings,
<dt>And by a kiss that ended in a sigh.
<p>
<h3>II.  Morning</h3>
<p>
<dt>The wind of morn awoke before the line
<dt>Of dawn's pearl haze made pale the eastern sky,
<dt>And woke the birds and woodland creatures shy,
<dt>And sighed night's dirge through tremulous boughs of pine.
<dt>The north and south sky flushed, and the divine
<dt>Rose-radiance touched the moorland lone and high,
<dt>While still the wood was dusk, where, by and by,
<dt>Splendid and strong the risen sun should shine.
<p>
<dt>It shone--on two that through the woodland came
<dt>With eyes averted and cold hands that clung
<dt>And weary lips that knew forbidden things,
<dt>And hearts made sick with vain imaginings--
<dt>And over all the wood its glory flung,
<dt>The wood--that never more could be the same.

<p>
<dt>The flood of utter change is loosed.  A space
<dt>Is ours yet, for its coming to prepare.
<dt>Shall we build dams with cautious, clumsy care,
<dt>Or stand with idle hands and frightened face,
<dt>And so be whirled all broken from our place,
<dt>Or perish with the dams we builded there?
<dt>Or shall we dig a broad, deep channel, where
<dt>Most fields may feel the flood's benign embrace?
<p>
<dt>Thus turned 'twill be a calm majestic flood
<dt>Of plenty, peace, and fertilising power,
<dt>Whose banks fresh flowers of love and joy shall deck.
<dt>Oppose it: at the inevitable hour,
<dt>Tumultuous, black with ruin, red with blood,
<dt>'Twill come--and you shall have no chance but wreck!
