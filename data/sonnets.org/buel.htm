<h3>   April   27, 1882</h3>
<p>
<dt>The Keeper of the Concord Light is dead,
<dt>And gone its shining way to Paradise;
<dt>From that Snug Harbor of the soul he spies
<dt>A beacon-glory round his memory shed
<dt>By waves that bring to hungry mortals bread,
<dt>Once cast upon the waters by the wise,
<dt>Kind hand that kept the Light.&nbsp; His startled eyes
<dt>Gleam heavenly joy, then fill with modest dread
<p></p>
<dt>And turn to greet the friends of other days,
<dt>Who lead him to his castles, late of Spain,
<dt>Within whose halls resound his unsung lays:
<dt>The while a busy world beneath the wain,
<dt>That plucks a star from Concord's peaceful ways,
<dt>In reverence pauses at a new-made fane. 
<h2><a name="poet"></a>Poet and Actress</h2>
<dt>When Avon's Bard his sweetest music scored,
<dt>A woman's vision with the numbers blent;
<dt>Each to the other equal beauty lent
<dt>As weaving fancy robed the form adored.
<dt>O Poet, didst thou see upon the board
<dt>Eye-filling Rosalind, whose playful bent
<dt>Suffused thy lines?&nbsp; Juliet, all passion-spent?
<dt>Viola's sweet self, and Imogen's restored?
<p></p><dt>'Twas thine to give the music-mated lines,
<dt>But Heaven alone empowers the counterpart
<dt>To walk in splendor where such genius shines.
<dt>Thrice happy we, blest heirs of dual art
<dt>To own as mother-tongue Will Shakespeare's writ,
<dt>To live when kindling Neilson voices it.
