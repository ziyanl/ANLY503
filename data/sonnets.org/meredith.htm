<p>
<dt>By this he knew she wept with waking eyes:
<dt>That, at his hand's light quiver by her head,
<dt>The strange low sobs that shook their common bed
<dt>Were called into her with a sharp surprise,
<dt>And strangled mute, like little gaping snakes,
<dt>Dreadfully venomous to him. She lay
<dt>Stone-still, and the long darkness flowed away
<dt>With muffled pulses. Then, as midnight makes
<dt>Her giant heart of Memory and Tears
<dt>Drink the pale drug of silence, and so beat
<dt>Sleep's heavy measure, they from head to feet
<dt>WEre moveless, looking through their dead black years
<dt>By vain regret scrawled over the blank wall.
<dt>Like sculptured effigies they might be seen
<dt>Upon their marriage-tomb, the sword between;
<dt>Each wishing for the sword that severs all.
</p>
<p>
<a name=016></a><h2>"In our old shipwrecked days there was an hour"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In our old shipwrecked days there was an hour
<dt>When in the firelight steadily aglow,
<dt>Joined slackly, we beheld the red chasm grow
<dt>Among the clicking coals. Our library-bower
<dt>That eve was left to us: and hushed we sat
<dt>As lovers to whom Time is whispering.
<dt>From sudden-opened doors we heard them sing:
<dt>The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat.
<dt>Well knew we that Life's greatest treasure lay
<dt>With us, and of it was our talk. "Ah, yes!
<dt>Love dies!" I said: I never thought it less.
<dt>She yearned to me that sentence to unsay.
<dt>Then when the fire domed blackening, I found
<dt>Her cheek was salt against my kiss, and swift
<dt>Up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift:--
<dt>Now am I haunted by that taste! that sound!
</p>
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>Lucifer in Starlight</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>On a starred night Prince Lucifer uprose.
<dt>Tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend
<dt>Above the rolling ball in cloud part screened,
<dt>Where sinners hugged their spectre of repose.
<dt>Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those.
<dt>And now upon his western wing he leaned,
<dt>Now his huge bulk o'er Afric's sands careened,
<dt>Now the black planet shadowed Arctic snows.
<dt>Soaring through wider zones that pricked his scars
<dt>With memory of the old revolt from Awe,
<dt>He reached a middle height, and at the stars,
<dt>Which are the brain of heaven, he looked, and sank.
<dt>Around the ancient track marched, rank on rank,
<dt>The army of unalterable law.
</p>
<p>
<a name=046></a><h2>XLVI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>At last we parley: we so strangely dumb
<dt>In such a close communion! It befell
<dt>About the sounding of the Matin-bell,
<dt>And lo! her place was vacant, and the hum
<dt>Of loneliness was round me. Then I rose,
<dt>And my disordered brain did guide my foot
<dt>To that old wood where our first love-salute
<dt>Was interchanged: the source of many throes!
<dt>There did I see her, not alone. I moved
<dt>Toward her, and made proffer of my arm.
<dt>She took it simply, with no rude alarm;
<dt>And that disturbing shadow passed reproved.
<dt>I felt the pained speech coming, and declared
<dt>My firm belief in her, ere she could speak.
<dt>A ghastly morning came into her cheek,
<dt>While with a widening soul on me she stared.
</p>

<a name=047></a><h2>XLVII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>We saw the swallows gathering in the sky,
<dt>And in the osier-isle we heard them noise.
<dt>We had not to look back on summer joys,
<dt>Or forward to a summer of bright dye:
<dt>But in the largeness of the evening earth
<dt>Our spirits grew as we went side by side.
<dt>The hour became her husband and my bride.
<dt>Love that had robbed us so, thus blessed our dearth!
<dt>The pilgrims of the year waxed very loud
<dt>In multitudinous chatterings, as the flood
<dt>Full brown came from the West, and like pale blood
<dt>Expanded to the upper crimson cloud.
<dt>Love that had robbed us of immortal things,
<dt>This little moment mercifully gave,
<dt>Where I have seen across the twilight wave
<dt>The swan sail with her young beneath her wings.
