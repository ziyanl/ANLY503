Within her hair Venus and Cupid sport them;
<dt>
Some time they twist it, amber-like, in gold,
<dt>
To which the whistling winds do oft resort them,
<dt>
As if they strove to have the knots unrolled;
<dt>
Some time they let their golden tresses dangle,
<dt>
And therewith nets and amorous gins they make
<dt>
Wherewith the hearts of lovers to entangle,
<dt>
Which once enthralled, no ransom they will take.
<dt>
But as two tyrants sitting in their thrones
<dt>
Look on their slaves with tyrannizing eyes;
<dt>
So they, no whit regarding lovers' moans,
<dt>
Doom worlds of hearts to endless slaveries
<dt>
Unless they subject-like swear to adore
<dt>
And serve Emaricdulfe forevermore.

  "I am enchanted with thy snow-white hands"

<P>
<dt>
I am enchanted with thy snow-white hands
<dt>
That maze me with their quaint dexterity,
<dt>
And with their touch tie in a thousand bands
<dt>
My yielding heart ever to honor thee;
<dt>
Thought of thy dainty fingers long and small,
<dt>
For pretty action that exceed compare,
<dt>
Sufficient is to bless me, and withal
<dt>
To free my chain&eacute;d thoughts from sorrow's snare.
<dt>
But that which crowns my soul with heavenly bliss,
<dt>
And gives my heart fruition of all joys,
<dt>
Their dainty concord and sweet music is,
<dt>
That poisons grief and cureth all annoys.
<dt>
Those eyes that see, those ears are blest that hear
<dt>
These heavenly gifts of nature in my dear.

  "My heart is like a ship on Neptune's back"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
My heart is like a ship on Neptune's back;
<dt>
Thy beauty is the sea where my ship saileth;
<dt>
Thy frowns the surges are that threat my wrack,
<dt>
Thy smiles the winds that on my sails soft galeth.
<dt>
Long tossed betwixt fair hope and foul despair,
<dt>
My sea-sick heart, arriv&eacute;d on thy shore--
<dt>
Thy love, I mean--begs that he may repair
<dt>
His broken vessel with thy bounteous store.
<dt>
Dido relieved Aeneas in distress,
<dt>
And lent him love, and gave to him her heart;
<dt>
If half such bounty thou to me express,
<dt>
From thy fair shore I never will depart,
<dt>
But thank kind fortune that my course did sort
<dt>
To suffer shipwreck on so sweet a port.
