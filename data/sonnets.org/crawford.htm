<a name=010></a><h2>At Camelot</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Her maiden dreams were redolent of love,
<dt>Warm-bosomed as she breathed the passionate air
<dt>Of old romance, and did in fancy move
<dt>'Mong the gay knights who died for ladies fair;
<dt>Until she heard the thunder of the press,
<dt>And so became a lover; her heart rang
<dt>The note of love's alarm, his tenderness,
<dt>When in the onset all the tourney sang.
<dt>And she was one of the dead ladies who,
<dt>In beauty's blazon, to his misty bower
<dt>With Launcelot, when the Queen was gone, withdrew
<dt>Under the shadow of the tourney tower;
<dt>And, lilting to him through the gloaming, made
<dt>His heart a lyre whereon her passion played.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>For Lilian</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>She was so dear, so fair. Her memory stays,
<dt>Even her dying robs me not of this,
<dt>That I have walked with her in mortal ways
<dt>Whose tender beauty now immortal is.
<dt>There are sweet flowers that bloom in ways forlorn
<dt>And sad sweet eyes whose beauty is a flower
<dt>Blown in the night to which there is no morn,
<dt>Dream-born and dying in its dewy bower;
<dt>And she was such a flower, her sweet eyes such;
<dt>The secret hours that only the heart knows
<dt>Thrill with the glamour of her tone and touch
<dt>Like music that is sweetest at the close,
<dt>Falling to death as falls the fairest thing
<dt>Beyond the power of love's recovering.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Toward the Close</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Time grows upon us until we exhaust
<dt>Hope's possibilities, and then we die
<dt>Who thus of life each make a holocaust
<dt>Till all we have in nature is put by.
<dt>No one survives himself, and none can so
<dt>Reclaim the sentiment of youth that he
<dt>Would like a fallen leaf re-budded grow
<dt>On the bare bough of joy's mortality.
<dt>Oh! in what charms may death himself reveal
<dt>When the life-instinct turns at last to him
<dt>For supreme succour, for the power to heal
<dt>That sickness of our days when all grows dim!
<dt>More fragrant then than roses, sweeter far,
<dt>The airs that come from the old darkness are.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Dream-Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There is a breath at midnight that comes in
<dt>Sad as a sigh, for then the day is dead
<dt>And the young morrow doth his course begin,
<dt>Sowing new dreams in many a dreamer's head.
<dt>And there are two have waked in one dark bed
<dt>Just as the last stroke fades in lonely air,
<dt>And having whispered, half-awake, have sped
<dt>With silent feet into sleep's poppied lair.
<dt>She with the morning wakes, but he is gone;
<dt>Her tears and kisses are of no avail--
<dt>Perchance it was his good-bye murmured on
<dt>The midnight in death's visionary dale.
<dt>Ah, woe! she thought 'twas in sleep's fairyland
<dt>When in the dark he pressed her warm, soft hand.
