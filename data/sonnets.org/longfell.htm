<P>
<dt>Half of my life is gone, and I have let
<dt>The years slip from me and have not fulfilled
<dt>The asperations of my youth, to build
<dt>Some tower of song with lofty parapet.
<dt>Not indolence, nor pleasure, nor the fret
<dt>Of restless passions that would not be stilled,
<dt>But sorrow, and a care that almost killed,
<dt>Kept me from what I may accomplish yet;
<dt>Though, half-way up the hill, I see the Past
<dt>Lying beneath me with its sounds and sights,--
<dt>A city in the twilight dim and vast,
<dt>With smoking roofs, soft bells, and gleaming lights,--
<dt>And hear above me on the autumnal blast
<dt>The cataract of Death far thundering from the heights.
</P>
<a name=200></a><h2>The Cross of Snow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>In the long, sleepless watches of the night
<dt>A gentle face--the face of one long dead--
<dt>Looks at me from the wall, where round its head
<dt>The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.
<dt>Here in this room she died; and soul more white
<dt>Never through martyrdom of fire was led
<dt>To its repose; nor can in books be read
<dt>The legend of a life more benedight.
<dt>There is a mountain in the distant West
<dt>That, sun-defying, in its deap ravines
<dt>Displays a cross of snow upon its side.
<dt>Such is the cross I wear upon my breast
<dt>These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes
<dt>And seasons, changeless since the day she died.
</P>
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>Milton</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I pace the sounding sea-beach and behold
<dt>How the voluminous billows roll and run,
<dt>Upheaving and subsiding, while the sun
<dt>Shines through their sheeted emerald far unrolled,
<dt>And the ninth wave, slow gathering fold by fold
<dt>All its loose-flowing garments into one,
<dt>Plunges upon the shore, and floods the dun
<dt>Pale reach of sands, and changes them to gold.
<dt>So in majestic cadence rise and fall
<dt>The mighty undulations of thy song,
<dt>O sightless bard, England's Maeonides!
<dt>And ever and anon, high over all
<dt>Uplifted, a ninth wave superb and strong,
<dt>Floods all the soul with its melodious seas.
</p>
<p>
<a name=400></a><h2>The Poets</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O ye dead Poets, who are living still
<dt>Immortal in your verse, though life be fled,
<dt>And ye, O living Poets, who are dead
<dt>Though ye are living, if neglect can kill,
<dt>Tell me if in the darkest hours of ill,
<dt>With drops of anguish falling fast and red
<dt>From the sharp crown of thorns upon your head,
<dt>Ye were not glad your errand to fulfil?
<dt>Yes; for the gift and ministry of Song
<dt>Have something in them so divinely sweet,
<dt>It can assuage the bitterness of wrong;
<dt>Not in the clamor of the crowded street,
<dt>Not in the shouts and plaudits of the throng,
<dt>But in ourselves, are triumph and defeat.
</p>
<p>
<a name=405></a><h2>Dante</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Tuscan, that wanderest through the realms of gloom,
<dt>With thoughtful pace, and sad, majestic eyes,
<dt>Stern thoughts and awful from they thoughts arise,
<dt>Like Farinata from his fiery tomb.
<dt>Thy sacred song is like the trump of doom;
<dt>Yet in thy heart what human sympathies,
<dt>What soft compassion glows, as in the skies
<dt>The tender stars their clouded lamps relume!
<dt>Methinks I see thee stand, with pallid cheeks,
<dt>By Fra Hilario in his diocese,
<dt>As up the convent-walls, in golden streaks,
<dt>The ascending sunbeams mark the day's decrease,
<dt>And, as he asks what there the stranger seeks,
<dt>Thy voice along the cloister whispers, "Peace!"
</p>
<p>
<a name=410></a><h2>The Tides</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I saw the long line of the vacant shore,
<dt>The sea-weed and the shells upon the sand,
<dt>And the brown rocks left bare on every hand
<dt>As if the ebbing tide would flow no more.
<dt>Then heard I, more distinctly than before,
<dt>The ocean breathe and its great breast expand,
<dt>And hurrying came on the defenseless land
<dt>The insurgent waters with tumultuous roar.
<dt>All thought and feeling and desire, I said,
<dt>Love, laughter, and the exultant joy of song,
<dt>Have ebbed from me for ever! Suddenly o'er me
<dt>They swept again from their deep ocean bed,
<dt>And in a tumult of delight, and strong
<dt>As youth, and beautiful as youth, upbore me!
</p>
<p>
<a name=415></a><h2>The Galaxy</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Torrent of light and river of the air,
<dt>Along whose bed the glimmering stars are seen
<dt>Like gold and silver sands in some ravine
<dt>Where mountain streams have left their channels bare!
<dt>The Spaniard sees in thee the pathway, where
<dt>His patron saint descended in the sheen
<dt>Of his celestial armor, on serene
<dt>And quiet nights, when all the heavens were fair.
<dt>Not this I see, nor yet the ancient fable
<dt>Of Phaeton's wild course, that scorched the skies
<dt>Wherever the hoofs of his hot coursers trod;
<dt>But the white drift of worlds o'er chasms of sable,
<dt>The star-dust, that is whirled aloft and flies
<dt>From the invisible chariot-wheels of God.
</p>
<p>
<a name=420></a><h2>The Broken Oar</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Once upon Iceland's solitary strand
<dt>A poet wandered with his book and pen,
<dt>Seeking some final word, some sweet Amen,
<dt>Wherewith to close the volume in his hand.
<dt>The billows rolled and plunged upon the sand,
<dt>The circling sea-gulls swept beyond his ken,
<dt>And from the parting cloud-rack now and then
<dt>Flashed the red sunset over sea and land.
<dt>Then by the billows at his feet was tossed
<dt>A broken oar; and carved thereon he read,
<dt>"Oft was I weary, when I toiled at thee;"
<dt>And like a man, who findeth what was lost,
<dt>He wrote the words, then lifted up his head,
<dt>And flung his useless pen into the sea.
</p>
<p>
<a name=425></a><h2>Chimes</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sweet chimes! that in the loneliness of night
<dt>Salute the passing hour, and in the dark
<dt>And silent chambers of the household mark
<dt>The movements of the myriad orbs of light
<dt>Through my close eyelids, by the inner sight,
<dt>I see the constellations in the arc
<dt>Of their great circles moving on, and hark!
<dt>I almost hear them singing in their flight.
<dt>Better than sleep it is to lie awake
<dt>O'ercanopied by the vast starry dome
<dt>Of the immeasurable sky; to feel
<dt>The slumbering world sink under us, and make
<dt>Hardly an eddy,--a mere rush of foam
<dt>On the great sea beneath a sinking keel.
</p>
<p>
<a name=430></a><h2>Holidays</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The holiest of all holidays are those
<dt>Kept by ourselves in silence and apart;
<dt>The secret anniversaries of the heart,
<dt>When the full river of feeling overflows;---
<dt>The happy days unclouded to their close;
<dt>The sudden joys that out of darkness start
<dt>As flames from ashes; swift desires that dart
<dt>Like swallows singing down each wind that blows.
<dt>White as the gleam of a receding sail,
<dt>White as a cloud that floats and fades in air,
<dt>White as the whitest lily on the stream,
<dt>These tender memories are;--a Fairy Tale
<dt>Of some enchanted land we know not where,
<dt>But lovely as a landscape in a dream.
</p>
<p>
<a name=435></a><h2>The Two Rivers</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Slowly the hour-hand of the clock moves round;
<dt>So slowly that no human eye hath power
<dt>To see it move! Slowly in shine or shower
<dt>The painted ship above it, homeward bound,
<dt>Sails, but seems motionless, as if aground;
<dt>Yet both arrive at last; and in his tower
<dt>The slumbrous watchman wakes and strikes the hour,
<dt>A mellow, measured, melancholy sound.
<dt>Midnight! the outpost of advancing day!
<dt>The frontier town and citadel of night!
<dt>The watershed of Time, from which the streams
<dt>Of Yesterday and To-morrow take their way,
<dt>One to the land of promise and of light,
<dt>One to the land of darkness and of dreams.
</p>
<p>
<a name=440></a><h2>Venice</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>White swan of cities, slumbering in thy nest
<dt>So wonderfully built among the reeds
<dt>Of the lagoon, that fences thee and feeds,
<dt>As sayeth thy old historian and thy guest!
<dt>White water-lily, cradled and caressed
<dt>By ocean streams, and from the silt and weeds
<dt>Lifting thy golden filaments and seeds,
<dt>Thy sun-illumined spires, thy crown and crest!
<dt>White phantom city, whose untrodden streets
<dt>Are rivers, and whose pavements are the shifting
<dt>Shadows of palaces and strips of sky;
<dt>I wait to see thee vanish like the fleets
<dt>Seen in a mirage, or towers of cloud uplifting
<dt>In air their unsubstantial masonry.
</p>
<p>
<a name=445></a><h2>The Sound of the Sea</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The sea awoke at midnight from its sleep,
<dt>And round the pebbly beaches far and wide
<dt>I heard the first wave of the rising tide
<dt>Rush onward with uninterrupted sweep;
<dt>A voice out of the silence of the deep,
<dt>A sound mysteriously multiplied
<dt>As of a cataract from the mountain's side,
<dt>Or roar of winds upon a wooded steep.
<dt>So comes to us at times, from the unknown
<dt>And inaccessible solitudes of being,
<dt>The rushing of the sea-tides of the soul:
<dt>And inspirations that we deem our own,
<dt>Are some divine foreshadowing and foreseeing
<dt>Of things beyond our reason or control.
</p>
<p>
<a name=450></a><h2>Nature</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As a fond mother when the day is o'er
<dt>Leads by the hand her little child to bed,
<dt>Half willing, half reluctant to be led,
<dt>And leave his broken playthings on the floor,
<dt>Still gazing at them through the open door,
<dt>Nor wholly reassured and comforted
<dt>By promises of others in their stead
<dt>Which, though more splendid, may not please him more.
<dt>So Nature deals with us and takes away
<dt>Our playthings one by one, and by the hand
<dt>Leads us to rest so gently, that we go,
<dt>Scarce knowing if we wished to go or stay,
<dt>Being too full of sleep to understand
<dt>How far the unknown transcends the what we know.
</p>
<p>
<a name=455></a><h2>Autumn</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou comest, Autumn, heralded by the rain,
<dt>With banners, by great gales incessant fanned,
<dt>Brighter than brightest silks of Samarcand,
<dt>And stately oxen harnessed to thy wain!
<dt>Thou standest, like imperial Charlemagne,
<dt>Upon thy bridge of gold; thy royal hand
<dt>Outstretched with benedictions o'er the land,
<dt>Blessing the farms through all thy vast domain!
<dt>Thy shield is the red harvest moon, suspended
<dt>So long beneath the heaven's o'erhanging eaves;
<dt>Thy steps are by the farmer's prayers attended;
<dt>Like flames upon an altar shine the sheaves;
<dt>And following thee, in thy ovation splendid,
<dt>Thine Almoner, the wind, scatters thy golden leaves!
</p>
<p>
<h2>Divina Commedia</h2>
<a name=500></a><h2>I</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oft have I seen at some cathedral door
<dt>A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,
<dt>Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet
<dt>Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor
<dt>Kneel to repeat his paternoster o'er;
<dt>Far off the noises of the world retreat;
<dt>The loud vociferations of the street
<dt>Become an undistinguishable roar.
<dt>So, as I enter here from day to day,
<dt>And leave my burden at this minster gate,
<dt>Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,
<dt>The tumult of the time disconsolate
<dt>To inarticulate murmurs dies away,
<dt>While the eternal ages watch and wait.
</p>
<p>
<a name=501></a><h2>II</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers!
<dt>This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves
<dt>Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves
<dt>Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers,
<dt>And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!
<dt>But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves
<dt>Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,
<dt>And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers!
<dt>Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain,
<dt>What exultations trampling on despair,
<dt>What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,
<dt>What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,
<dt>Uprose this poem of the earth and air,
<dt>This mediaeval miracle of song!
</p>
<p>
<a name=502></a><h2>III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I enter, and I see thee in the gloom
<dt>Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine!
<dt>And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine.
<dt>The air is filled with some unknown perfume;
<dt>The congregation of the dead make room
<dt>For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine;
<dt>Like rooks that haunt Ravenna's groves of pine
<dt>The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb.
<dt>From the confessionals I hear arise
<dt>Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies,
<dt>And lamentations from the crypts below;
<dt>And then a voice celestial that begins
<dt>With the pathetic words, "Although your sins
<dt>As scarlet be," and ends with "as the snow."
</p>
<p>
<a name=503></a><h2>IV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>With snow-white veil and garments as of flame,
<dt>She stands before thee, who so long ago
<dt>Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe
<dt>From which thy song and all its splendors came;
<dt>And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name,
<dt>The ice about thy heart melts as the snow
<dt>On mountain heights, and in swift overflow
<dt>Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame.
<dt>Thou makest full confession; and a gleam,
<dt>As of the dawn on some dark forest cast,
<dt>Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase;
<dt>Lethe and Eunoc--the remembered dream
<dt>And the forgotten sorrow--bring at last
<dt>That perfect pardon which is perfect peace.
</p>
<p>
<a name=504></a><h2>V</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I lift mine eyes, and all the windows blaze
<dt>With forms of Saints and holy men who died,
<dt>Here martyred and hereafter glorffied;
<dt>And the great Rose upon its leaves displays
<dt>Christ's Triumph, and the angelic roundelays,
<dt>With splendor upon splendor multiplied;
<dt>And Beatrice again at Dante's side
<dt>No more rebukes, but smiles her words of praise.
<dt>And then the organ sounds, and unseen choirs
<dt>Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love
<dt>And benedictions of the Holy Ghost;
<dt>And the melodious bells among the spires
<dt>O'er all the house-tops and through heaven above
<dt>Proclaim the elevation of the Host!
</p>
<p>
<a name=505></a><h2>VI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O star of morning and of liberty!
<dt>O bringer of the light, whose splendor shines
<dt>Above the darkness of the Apennines,
<dt>Forerunner of the day that is to be!
<dt>The voices of the city and the sea,
<dt>The voices of the mountains and the pines,
<dt>Repeat thy song, till the familiar lines
<dt>Are footpaths for the thought of Italy!
<dt>Thy flame is blown abroad from all the heights,
<dt>Through all the nations, and a sound is heard,
<dt>As of a mighty wind, and men devout,
<dt>Strangers of Rome, and the new proselytes,
<dt>In their own language hear thy wondrous word,
<dt>And many are amazed and many doubt.
