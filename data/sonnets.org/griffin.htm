  "Arraigned, poor captive at the bar I stand"

<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Arraigned, poor captive at the bar I stand,
<dt>
The bar of beauty, bar to all my joys;
<dt>
And up I hold my ever-trembling hand,
<dt>
Wishing or life or death to end annoys.
<dt>
And when the judge doth question of the guilt
<dt>
And bids me speak, then sorrow shuts up words.
<dt>
Yea, though he say, Speak boldly what thou wilt,
<dt>
Yet my confused affects no speech affords.
<dt>
For why, alas, my passions have no bound,
<dt>
For fear of death that penetrates so near;
<dt>
And still one grief another doth confound,
<dt>
Yet doth at length a way to speech appear.
<dt>
Then, for I speak too late, the judge doth give
<dt>
His sentence that in prison I shall live.

  "Compare me to the child that plays with fire"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Compare me to the child that plays with fire,
<dt>
Or to the fly that dieth in the flame,
<dt>
Or to the foolish boy that did aspire
<dt>
To touch the glory of high heaven's frame;
<dt>
Compare me to Leander struggling in the waves,
<dt>
Not able to attain his safety's shore,
<dt>
Or to the sick that do expect their graves,
<dt>
Or to the captive crying evermore;
<dt>
Compare me to the weeping wounded hart,
<dt>
Moaning with tears the period of his life,
<dt>
Or to the boar that will not feel his smart
<dt>
When he is stricken with the butcher's knife:
<dt>
No man to these can fitly me compare;
<dt>
These live to die, I die to live in care.

  "Care-charmer sleep, sweet ease in restless misery"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Care-charmer sleep, sweet ease in restless misery,
<dt>
The captive's liberty, and his freedom's song,
<dt>
Balm of the bruised heart, man's chief felicity,
<dt>
Brother of quiet death, when life is too, too long!
<dt>
A comedy it is, and now an history
<dt>
What is not sleep unto the feeble mind!
<dt>
It easeth him that toils and him that's sorry,
<dt>
It makes the deaf to hear to see the blind.
<dt>
Ungentle sleep, thou helpest all but me,
<dt>
For when I sleep my soul is vexe'd most.
<dt>
It is Fidessa that doth master thee;
<dt>
If she approach, alas, thy power is lost.
<dt>
But here she is. See, how he runs amain!
<dt>
I fear at night he will not come again.

  "Fly to her heart, hover about her heart"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<p>
<dt>
Fly to her heart, hover about her heart,
<dt>
With dainty kisses mollify her heart,
<dt>
Pierce with thy arrows her obdurate heart,
<dt>
With sweet allurements ever move her heart,
<dt>
At mid-day and at midnight touch her heart,
<dt>
Be lurking closely, nestle about her heart,
<dt>
With power (thou art a god) command her heart,
<dt>
Kindle thy coals of love about her heart,
<dt>
Yea, even into thyself transform her heart.
<dt>
Ah, she must love! Be sure thou have her heart,
<dt>
And I must die if thou have not her heart,
<dt>
Thy bed, if thou rest well, must be her heart,
<dt>
He hath the best part sure that hath the heart.
<dt>
What have I not, if I have but her heart!

  "I have not spent the April of my time"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
I have not spent the April of my time,
<dt>
The sweet of youth, in plotting in the air,
<dt>
But do at first adventure seek to climb,
<dt>
Whilst flowers of blooming years are green and fair.
<dt>
I am no leaving of all-withering age,
<dt>
I have not suffered many winter lours;
<dt>
I feel no storm unless my love do rage,
<dt>
And then in grief I spend both days and hours.
<dt>
This yet doth comfort, that my flower lasted
<dt>
Until it did approach my sun too near,
<dt>
And then, alas, untimely was it blasted,
<dt>
So soon as once thy beauty did appear.
<dt>
But after all, my comfort rests in this,
<dt>
That for thy sake my youth decayed is.

  "Fair is my love that feeds among the lilies"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Fair is my love that feeds among the lilies,
<dt>
The lilies growing in that pleasant garden
<dt>
Where Cupid's mount, that well beloved hill is,
<dt>
And where that little god himself is warden.
<dt>
See where my love sits in the beds of spices,
<dt>
Beset all round with camphor, myrrh, and roses,
<dt>
And interlaced with curious devices,
<dt>
Which her from all the world apart incloses.
<dt>
There doth she tune her lute for her delight,
<dt>
And with sweet music makes the ground to move,
<dt>
Whilst I, poor I, do sit in heavy plight,
<dt>
Wailing alone my unrespected love;
<dt>
Not daring rush into so rare a place,
<dt>
That gives to her, and she to it, a grace.

  "Tell me of love, sweet Love, who is thy sire?"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Tell me of love, sweet Love, who is thy sire?
<dt>
Or if thou mortal or immortal be
<dt>
Some say thou art begotten by desire,
<dt>
Nourished with hope, and fed with fantasy,
<dt>
Engendered by a heavenly goddess' eye,
<dt>
Lurking most sweetly in an angel's face;
<dt>
Others, that beauty thee doth deify-
<dt>
O sovereign beauty, full of power and grace!
<dt>
But I must be absurd all this denying,
<dt>
Because the fairest fair alive ne'er knew thee.
<dt>
Now, Cupid, comes thy godhead to the trying:
<dt>
'Twas she alone (such is her power) that slew me.
<dt>
She shall be love, and thou a foolish boy,
<dt>
Whose virtue proves thy power but a toy.

  "Work, work apace, you blessed sisters three"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Work, work apace, you blessed sisters three,
<dt>
In restless twining of my fatal thread.
<dt>
O let your nimble hands at once agree
<dt>
To weave it out and cut it off with speed.
<dt>
Then shall my vexed and tormented ghost
<dt>
Have quiet passage to the Elysian rest,
<dt>
And sweetly over death and fortune boast
<dt>
In everlasting triumphs with the blest.
<dt>
But ah, too well I know you have conspired
<dt>
A lingering death for him that loatheth life,
<dt>
As if with woes he never could be tired;
<dt>
For this you hide your all-dividing knife.
<dt>
One comfort yet the heavens have assigned me,
<dt>
That I must die and leave my griefs behind me.

  "If great Apollo offered as a dower"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
If great Apollo offered as a dower
<dt>
His burning throne to beauty's excellence;
<dt>
If Jove himself came in a golden shower
<dt>
Down to the earth, to fetch fair Io thence;
<dt>
If Venus in the curled locks were tied
<dt>
Of proud Adonis not of gentle kind;
<dt>
If Tellus for a shepherd's favor died,
<dt>
The favor cruel love to her assigned;
<dt>
If heaven's winged herald, Hermes, had
<dt>
His heart enchanted with a country maid;
<dt>
If poor Pygmalion were for beauty mad;
<dt>
If gods and men have all for beauty strayed:
<dt>
I am not then ashamed to be included
<dt>
'Mongst those that love, and be with love deluded.
