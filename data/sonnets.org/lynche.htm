<p>
<dt>Soon as the azure-colored gates of th' east
<dt>Were set wide open by the watchful morn,
<dt>I walked abroad, as having took no rest
<dt>(For nights are tedious to a man forlorn);
<dt>And viewing well each pearl-bedew&eacute;d flower,
<dt>Then waxing dry by splendor of the sun,
<dt>All scarlet-hued I saw him 'gin to lour
<dt>And blush, as though some heinous act were done.
<dt>At this amazed, I hied me home amain,
<dt>Thinking that I his anger caus&eacute;d had.
<dt>And at his set, abroad I walked again;
<dt>When lo, the moon looked wondrous pale and sad:
<dt>Anger the one, and envy moved the other,
<dt>To see my love more fair than Love's fair mother.

<p>
<dt>What sugared terms, what all-persuading art,
<dt>What sweet mellifluous words, what wounding looks
<dt>Love used for his admittance to my heart!
<dt>Such eloquence was never read in books.
<dt>He promised pleasure, rest, and endless joy,
<dt>Fruition of the fairest she alive.
<dt>His pleasure, pain; rest, trouble; joy, annoy,
<dt>Have I since found, which me of bliss deprive.
<dt>The Trojan horse thus have I now let in,
<dt>Wherein enclosed these arm&eacute;d men were placed
<dt>Bright eyes, fair cheeks, sweet lips, and milk-white skin;
<dt>These foes my life have overthrown and razed.
<dt>Fair outward shows prove inwardly the worst,
<dt>Love looketh fair, but lovers are accurst.

<p>
<dt>Weary with serving where I nought could get,
<dt>I thought to cross great Neptune's greatest seas,
<dt>To live in exile; but my drift was let
<dt>By cruel fortune, spiteful of such ease.
<dt>The ship I had to pass in was my mind,
<dt>Greedy desire was topsail of the same,
<dt>My tears were surges, sighs did serve for wind,
<dt>Of all my ship despair was chiefest frame;
<dt>Sorrow was master; care, the cable rope;
<dt>Grief was the mainmast; love, the captain of it;
<dt>He that did rule the helm was foolish hope;
<dt>But beauty was the rock that my ship split,
<dt>Which since bath made such shipwreck of my joy
<dt>That still I swim in th' ocean of annoy.
</p>
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>"End this enchantment, love, of my desires"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>End this enchantment, love, of my desires,
<dt>Let me no longer languish for thy love.
<dt>Joy not to see me thus consume in fires,
<dt>But let my cruel pains thy hard heart move.
<dt>And now, at last with pitiful regard
<dt>Eye me, thy lover, lorn for lack of thee,
<dt>Which, dying, lives in hope of sweet reward
<dt>Which hate hath hitherto withheld from me.
<dt>Constant have I been, still in fancy fast,
<dt>Ordained by heavens to dote upon thy fair;
<dt>Nor will I e'er, so long as life shall last,
<dt>Say any's fairer, breathing vital air.
<dt>But when the ocean sands shall lie unwet,
<dt>Then shall my soul to love thee, dear, forget.
