<a name=010></a><h2>At Parting</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Keep thou amidst the fulness of thy days
<dt>Some little space apart for thoughts of me,
<dt>Where all the best I have and am may be
<dt>Familiar and essential to thy ways;
<dt>Upon the hours' swift argosies emblaze
<dt>The prayer that ever shall encompass thee,
<dt>The hope, the aim, the spirit's sudden plea,
<dt>At once thy inspiration and thy praise.
<dt>For he who keeps within his heart a shrine
<dt>Where tender dreams may gather, makes defence
<dt>Against encroaching tides that undermine
<dt>The soul's integrity and confidence,
<dt>And I would have act in every act of thine
<dt>Love's presence conscious to thy deeper sense.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Among the Mountains</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As far as sight could reach the wild peaks rose,
<dt>Tier after tier against the limpid blue,
<dt>Titanic forms that stormed the heavens anew
<dt>At every turn, crowned with imperial snows;
<dt>And then, as day sank softly to its close,
<dt>Diaphanous, ethereal they grew,
<dt>Mere wraiths of rainbow-mist that from our view,
<dt>Dream-laden, lapsed to darkness and repose.
<dt>And suddenly I found my vision blurred,
<dt>And knew that deeper chord was touched again
<dt>Which once in Hungary, when I had heard
<dt>A passionately wild, appealing strain
<dt>Of gypsy music, left me strangely stirred
<dt>With incommunicable joy and pain.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Vanished Years</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>She sitteth in the sunshine, old and grey,
<dt>Her faded kerchief crossed upon her breast,
<dt>Her withered form in sober colors dressed,
<dt>Her thoughts fixed ever on the Far-away;
<dt>She scarcely sees the children at their play,
<dt>But looks beyond them to the crimsoning West
<dt>And still beyond, where everlasting rest
<dt>Remains to close and crown her little day.
<dt>But on her tranquil and unconscious face,
<dt>In lines engraved by joy no less than tears,
<dt>The story of her pilgrimage we trace,
<dt>For Youth, quick-flying, left his dearer part,
<dt>And all the fragrance of the vanished years,
<dt>Imperishable, lies within her heart.
