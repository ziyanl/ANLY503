<p>
<dt>I sought on earth a garden of delight,
<dt>Or island altar to the Sea and Air,
<dt>Where gentle music were accounted prayer,
<dt>And reason, veiled, performed the happy rite.
<dt>My sad youth worshipped at the piteous height
<dt>Where God vouchsafed the death of man to share;
<dt>His love made mortal sorrow light to bear,
<dt>But his deep wounds put joy to sham&egrave;d flight.
<dt>And though his arms, outstretched upon the tree,
<dt>Were beautiful, and pleaded my embrace,
<dt>My sins were loth to look upon his face.
<dt>So came I down from Golgotha to thee,
<dt>Eternal Mother; let the sun and sea
<dt>Heal me, and keep me in thy dwelling-place.
</p>
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>Slow and reluctant was the long descent</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Slow and reluctant was the long descent,
<dt>With many farewell pious looks behind,
<dt>And dumb misgivings where the path might wind,
<dt>And questionings of nature, as I went.
<dt>The greener branches that above me bent,
<dt>The broadening valleys, quieted my mind,
<dt>To the fair reasons of the Spring inclined
<dt>And to the Summer's tender argument.
<dt>But sometimes, as revolving night descended,
<dt>And in my childish heart the new song ended,
<dt>I lay down, full of longing, on the steep;
<dt>And, haunting still the lonely way I wended,
<dt>Into my dreams the ancient sorrow blended,
<dt>And with these holy echoes charmed my sleep.
</p>

<p>
<dt>O world, thou choosest not the better part!
<dt>It is not wisdom to be only wise,
<dt>And on the inward vision close the eyes,
<dt>But it is wisdom to believe the heart.
<dt>Columbus found a world, and had no chart,
<dt>Save one that faith deciphered in the skies;
<dt>To trust the soul's invincible surmise
<dt>Was all his science and his only art.
<dt>Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine
<dt>That lights the pathway but one step ahead
<dt>Across a void of mystery and dread.
<dt>Bid, then, the tender light of faith to shine
<dt>By which alone the mortal heart is led
<dt>Unto the thinking of the thought divine.
</p>
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>"I would I had been born in nature's day"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I would I had been born in nature's day,
<dt>When man was in the world a wide-eyed boy,
<dt>And clouds of sorrow crossed his sky of joy
<dt>To scatter dewdrops on the buds of May.
<dt>Then could he work and love and fight and pray,
<dt>Nor heartsick grow in fortune's long employ.
<dt>Mighty to build and ruthless to destroy
<dt>He lived, while mask&egrave;d death unquestioned lay.
<dt>Now ponder we the ruins of the years,
<dt>And groan beneath the weight of boasted gain;
<dt>No unsung bacchanal can charm our ears
<dt>And lead our dances to the woodland fane,
<dt>No hope of heaven sweeten our few tears
<dt>And hush the importunity of pain.
</p>

<a name=005></a><h2>"Dreamt I to-day the dream of yesternight"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Dreamt I to-day the dream of yesternight,
<dt>Sleep ever feigning one evolving theme,--
<dt>Of my two lives which should I call the dream?
<dt>Which action vanity? which vision sight?
<dt>Some greater waking must pronounce aright,
<dt>If aught abideth of the things that seem,
<dt>And with both currents swell the flooded stream
<dt>Into an ocean infinite of light.
<dt>Even such a dream I dream, and know full well
<dt>My waking passeth like a midnight spell,
<dt>But know not if my dreaming breaketh through
<dt>Into the deeps of heaven and of hell.
<dt>I know but this of all I would I knew:
<dt>Truth is a dream, unless my dream is true.

<a name=006></a><h2>"Love not as do the flesh-imprisoned men"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Love not as do the flesh-imprisoned men
<dt>Whose dreams are of a bitter bought caress,
<dt>Or even of a maiden's tenderness
<dt>Whom they love only that she loves again.
<dt>For it is but thyself thou lovest then,
<dt>Or what thy thoughts would glory to possess;
<dt>But love thou nothing thou wouldst love the less
<dt>If henceforth ever hidden from thy ken.
<dt>Love but the formless and eternal Whole
<dt>From whose effulgence one unheeded ray
<dt>Breaks on this prism of dissolving clay
<dt>Into the flickering colours of thy soul.
<dt>These flash and vanish; bid them not to stay,
<dt>For wisdom brightens as they fade away.
</p>
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>"I would I might forget that I am I"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I would I might forget that I am I,
<dt>And break the heavy chain that binds me fast,
<dt>Whose links about myself my deeds have cast.
<dt>What in the body's tomb doth buried lie
<dt>Is boundless; 'tis the spirit of the sky,
<dt>Lord of the future, guardian of the past,
<dt>And soon must forth, to know his own at last.
<dt>In his large life to live, I fain would die.
<dt>Happy the dumb beast, hungering for food,
<dt>But calling not his suffering his own;
<dt>Bless&egrave;d the angel, gazing on all good,
<dt>But knowing not he sits upon a throne;
<dt>Wretched the mortal, pondering his mood,
<dt>And doomed to know his aching heart alone,
</p>
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>"O Martyred Spirit of this helpless Whole"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O Martyred Spirit of this helpless Whole,
<dt>Who dost by pain for tyranny atone,
<dt>And in the star, the atom, and the stone,
<dt>Purgest the primal guilt, and in the soul;
<dt>Rich but in grief, thou dost thy wealth unroll,
<dt>And givest of thy substance to thine own,
<dt>Mingling the love, the laughter, and the groan
<dt>In the large hollow of the heaven's bowl.
<dt>Fill full my cup; the dregs and honeyed brim
<dt>I take from thy just hand, more worthy love
<dt>For sweetening not the draught for me or him.
<dt>What in myself I am, that let me prove;
<dt>Relent not for my feeble prayer, nor dim
<dt>The burning of thine altar for my hymn.
</p>
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>"Have patience; it is fit that in this wise"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Have patience; it is fit that in this wise
<dt>The spirit purge away its proper dross.
<dt>No endless fever doth thy watches toss,
<dt>For by excess of evil, evil dies.
<dt>Soon shall the faint world melt before thine eyes,
<dt>And, all life's losses cancelled by life's loss,
<dt>Thou shalt lay down all burdens on thy cross,
<dt>And be that day with God in Paradise.
<dt>Have patience; for a long eternity
<dt>No summons woke thee from thy happy sleep;
<dt>For love of God one vigil thou canst keep
<dt>And add thy drop of sorrow to the sea.
<dt>Having known grief, all will be well with thee,
<dt>Ay, and thy second slumber will be deep.
</p>
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>"Have I the heart to wander on the earth"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Have I the heart to wander on the earth;
<dt>So patient in her everlasting course,
<dt>Seeking no prize, but bowing to the force
<dt>That gives direction and hath given birth?
<dt>Rain tears, sweet Pity, to refresh my dearth,
<dt>And plough my sterile bosom, sharp Remorse,
<dt>That I grow sick and curse my being's source
<dt>If haply one day passes lacking mirth.
<dt>Doth the sun therefore burn, that I may bask?
<dt>Or do the tire&egrave;d earth and tireless sea,
<dt>That toil not for their pleasure, toil for me?
<dt>Amid the world's long striving, wherefore ask
<dt>What reasons were, or what rewards shall be?
<dt>The covenant God gave us is a task.
</p>
<p>
<a name=011></a><h2>"Deem not, because you see me in the press"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Deem not, because you see me in the press
<dt>Of this world's children run my fated race,
<dt>That I blaspheme against a proffered grace,
<dt>Or leave unlearned the love of holiness.
<dt>I honour not that sanctity the less
<dt>Whose aureole illumines not my face,
<dt>But dare not tread the secret, holy place
<dt>To which the priest and prophet have access.
<dt>For some are born to be beatified
<dt>By anguish, and by grievous penance done;
<dt>And some, to furnish forth the age's pride,
<dt>And to be praised of men beneath the sun;
<dt>And some are born to stand perplexed aside
<dt>From so much sorrow--of whom I am one.

<a name=012></a><h2>"Mightier storms than this are brewed on earth"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Mightier storms than this are brewed on earth
<dt>That pricks the crystal lake with summer showers.
<dt>The past hath treasure of sublimer hours,
<dt>And God is witness to their changeless worth.
<dt>Big is the future with portentous birth
<dt>Of battles numberless, and nature's powers
<dt>Outdo my dreams of beauty in the flowers,
<dt>And top my revels with the demons' mirth.
<dt>But thou, glad river that hast reached the plain,
<dt>Scarce wak'st the rushes to a slumberous sigh.
<dt>The mountains sleep behind thee, and the main
<dt>Awaits thee, lulling an eternal pain
<dt>With patience; nor doth Phoebe, throned on high,
<dt>The mirror of thy placid heart disdain.

<p>
<a name=013></a><h2>"Sweet are the days we wander with no hope"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sweet are the days we wander with no hope
<dt>Along life's labyrinthine trodden way,
<dt>With no impatience at the steep's delay,
<dt>Nor sorrow at the swift-descended slope.
<dt>Why this inane curiosity to grope
<dt>In the dim dust for gems' unmeaning ray?
<dt>Why this proud piety, that dares to pray
<dt>For a world wider than the heaven's cope?
<dt>Farewell, my burden! No more will I bear
<dt>The foolish load of my fond faith's despair,
<dt>But trip the idle race with careless feet.
<dt>The crown of olive let another wear;
<dt>It is my crown to mock the runner's heat
<dt>With gentle wonder and with laughter sweet.
</p>
<p>
<a name=014></a><h2>"There may be chaos still around the world"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There may be chaos still around the world,
<dt>This little world that in my thinking lies;
<dt>For mine own bosom is the paradise
<dt>Where all my life's fair visions are unfurled.
<dt>Within my nature's shell I slumber curled,
<dt>Unmindful of the changing outer skies,
<dt>Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,
<dt>Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.
<dt>I heed them not; or if the subtle night
<dt>Haunt me with deities I never saw,
<dt>I soon mine eyelid's drowsy curtain draw
<dt>To hide their myriad faces from my sight.
<dt>They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe
<dt>A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.
</p>
<p>
<a name=015></a><h2>"A wall, a wall to hem the azure sphere"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A wall, a wall to hem the azure sphere,
<dt>And hedge me in from the disconsolate hills!
<dt>Give me but one of all the mountain rills,
<dt>Enough of ocean in its voice I hear.
<dt>Come no profane insatiate mortal near
<dt>With the contagion of his passionate ills;
<dt>The smoke of battle all the valleys fills,
<dt>Let the eternal sunlight greet me here.
<dt>This spot is sacred to the deeper soul
<dt>And to the piety that mocks no more.
<dt>In nature's inmost heart is no uproar,
<dt>None in this shrine; in peace the heavens roll,
<dt>In peace the slow tides pulse from shore to shore,
<dt>And ancient quiet broods from pole to pole.
</p>
<p>
<a name=016></a><h2>"A thousand beauties that have never been"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A thousand beauties that have never been
<dt>Haunt me with hope and tempt me to pursue;
<dt>The gods, methinks, dwell just behind the blue;
<dt>The satyrs at my coming fled the green.
<dt>The flitting shadows of the grove between
<dt>The dryads' eyes were winking, and I knew
<dt>The wings of sacred Eros as he flew
<dt>And left me to the love of things not seen.
<dt>'Tis a sad love, like an eternal prayer,
<dt>And knows no keen delight, no faint surcease.
<dt>Yet from the seasons hath the earth increase,
<dt>And heaven shines as if the gods were there.
<dt>Had Dian passed there could no deeper peace
<dt>Embalm the purple stretches of the air.

<p>
<dt>There was a time when in the teeth of fate
<dt>I flung the challenge of the spirit's right;
<dt>The child, the dreamer of that visioned night,
<dt>Woke, and was humbled unto man's estate.
<dt>A slave I am; on sun and moon I wait,
<dt>Who heed not that I live upon their light.
<dt>Me they despise, but are themselves so bright
<dt>They flood my heart with love, and quench my hate.
<dt>O subtle Beauty, sweet persuasive worth
<dt>That didst the love of being first inspire,
<dt>We do thee homage both in death and birth.
<dt>Thirsting for thee, we die in thy great dearth,
<dt>Or borrow breath of infinite desire
<dt>To chase thine image through the haunted earth.

<p>
<dt>Blaspheme not love, ye lovers, nor dispraise
<dt>The wise divinity that makes you blind,
<dt>Sealing the eyes, but showing to the mind
<dt>The high perfection from which nature strays.
<dt>For love is God, and in unfathomed ways
<dt>Brings forth the beauty for which fancy pined.
<dt>I loved, and lost my love among mankind;
<dt>But I have found it after many days.
<dt>Oh, trust in God, and banish rash despair,
<dt>That, feigning evil, is itself the curse!
<dt>My angel is come back, more sad and fair,
<dt>And witness to the truth of love I bear,
<dt>With too much rapture for this sacred verse,
<dt>At the exceeding answer to my prayer.

<a name=019></a><h2>"Above the battlements of heaven rise"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Above the battlements of heaven rise
<dt>The glittering domes of the gods' golden dwelling,
<dt>Whence, like a constellation, passion-quelling,
<dt>The truth of all things feeds immortal eyes.
<dt>There all forgotten dreams of paradise
<dt>From the deep caves of memory upwelling,
<dt>All tender joys beyond our dim foretelling
<dt>Are ever bright beneath the flooded skies.
<dt>There we live o'er, amid angelic powers,
<dt>Our lives without remorse, as if not ours,
<dt>And others' lives with love, as if our own;
<dt>For we behold, from those eternal towers,
<dt>The deathless beauty of all wing&egrave;d hours,
<dt>And have our being in their truth alone.

<p>
<dt>These strewn thoughts, by the mountain pathway sprung,
<dt>I conned for comfort, till I ceased to grieve,
<dt>And with these flowering thorns I dare to weave
<dt>The crown, great Mother, on thine altar hung.
<dt>Teach thou a larger speech to my loosed tongue,
<dt>And to mine opened eyes thy secrets give,
<dt>That in thy perfect love I learn to live,
<dt>And in thine immortality be young.
<dt>The soul is not on earth an alien thing
<dt>That hath her life's rich sources otherwhere;
<dt>She is a parcel of the sacred air.
<dt>She takes her being from the breath of Spring,
<dt>The glance of Phoebus is her fount of light,
<dt>And her long sleep a draught of primal night.
