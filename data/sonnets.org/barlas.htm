<p>
<dt>Oblivion! is it not one name of death?
<dt>Nay, is not Lethe death's most dismal name,
<dt>Death growing hour by hour within our frame,
<dt>Death settling slowly in our brain, the breath
<dt>Of the soul ebbing, so that he who saith,
<dt>I am to-day as yesterday the same,
<dt>Lies, for his thoughts are fled like smoke from flame,
<dt>And like the dew his sorrow vanisheth.
<dt>Changed is the river, though the waves remain,
<dt>Which rocks of slowlier-changing circumstance
<dt>Plough up in every day of chafing foam.
<dt>Changed is the river, gone, gone to the main,
<dt>Yesterday's dream and last year's happy chance, 
<dt>And the heart's thoughts again return not home.
<p>
<a name=020></a><H2>Beauty's Anadems</H2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A dagger-hilt crusted with flaming gems:
<dt>A queen's rich girdle clasped with tiger's claws;
<dt>A lady's glove or a cat's velvet paws;
<dt>The whisper of a judge when he condemns;
<dt>Fierce night-shade berries purple on their stems
<dt>Among the rose's healthsome scarlet haws;
<dt>A rainbow-sheathed snake with jagged jaws:
<dt>Such are queen Beauty's sovran anadems.
<dt>For she caresses with a poisoned hand,
<dt>And venom hangs about her moistened lips,
<dt>And plots of murder lurk with her eyes
<dt>She loves lewd girls dancing a saraband
<dt>The murderer stabbing till all his body drips,
<dt>And thee, my gentle lady, and thy soft sighs.
<p>
<a name=030></a><H2>The Cat-Lady</H2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Her hair is yellow as sulphur, and her gaze
<dt>As brimstone burning blue and odorous:
<dt>I know not how her eyes came to be thus
<dt>But I do think her soul must be ablaze:
<dt>Their pupils wane or wax to blame or praise;
<dt>As a cat watches mice, she watches us;
<dt>And I am sure her claws are murderous,
<dt>So feline are her velvet coaxing ways.
<dt>She purrs like a young leopard soothed and pleased
<dt>At flattery; so too turns and snarls when teased,
<dt>And pats her love like a beast of prey.
<dt>I fancy too that over wine and food
<dt>Her saffron hair turns tawny and grand her mood--
<dt>She broods like a young lioness of play.
<p>
<a name=040></a><H2>Terrible Love</H2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The marriage of two murderers in the gloom
<dt>Of a dark fane to hymns of blackest night;
<dt>Before a priest who keeps his hands from sight
<dt>Hidden away beneath his robe of doom,
<dt>Lest any see the flowers of blood that bloom
<dt>For gems upon the fingers, red on white;
<dt>The while far up in domes of dizzy height
<dt>The trumpets of the organ peal and boom:
<dt>Such is our love. Oh sweet delicious lips
<dt>From which I fancy all the world's blood drips!
<dt>Oh supple waist, pale cheek, and eyes of fire,
<dt>Hard little breasts and white gigantic hips,
<dt>And blue-black hair with serpent coils that slips
<dt>Out of my hand in hours of red desire.
