<a name=001></a><h2>In a Spring Grove</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Here the white-ray'd anemone is born,
<dt>Wood-sorrel, and the varnish'd buttercup;
<dt>And primrose in its purfled green swathed up,
<dt>Pallid and sweet round every budding thorn,
<dt>Gray ash, and beech with rusty leaves outworn.
<dt>Here, too the darting linnet hath her nest
<dt>In the blue-lustred holly, never shorn,
<dt>Whose partner cheers her little brooding breast,
<dt>Piping from some near bough. O simple song!
<dt>O cistern deep of that harmonious rillet,
<dt>And these fair juicy stems that climb and throng
<dt>The vernal world, and unexhausted seas
<dt>Of flowing life, and soul that asks to fill it,
<dt>Each and all of these,--and more, and more than these!
</p>
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>In Snow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O English mother, in the ruddy glow
<dt>Hugging your baby closer when outside
<dt>You see the silent, soft, and cruel snow
<dt>Falling again, and think what ills betide
<dt>Unshelter'd creatures,--your sad thoughts may go
<dt>Where War and Winter now, two spectre-wolves,
<dt>Hunt in the freezing vapour that involves
<dt>Those Asian peaks of ice and gulfs below.
<dt>Does this young Soldier heed the snow that fills
<dt>His mouth and open eyes? or mind, in truth,
<dt>To-night, his mother's parting syllables?
<dt>Ha! is't a red coat?--Merely blood. Keep ruth
<dt>For others; this is but an Afghan youth
<dt>Shot by the stranger on his native hills.
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>On a Forenoon of Spring</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I'm glad I am alive, to see and feel
<dt>The full deliciousness of this bright day,
<dt>That's like a heart with nothing to conceal;
<dt>The young leaves scarcely trembling; the blue-grey
<dt>Rimming the cloudless ether far away;
<dt>Brairds, hedges, shadows; mountains that reveal
<dt>Soft sapphire; this great floor of polished steel
<dt>Spread out amidst the landmarks of the bay.
<p>
<dt>I stoop in sunshine to our circling net
<dt>From the black gunwale; tend these milky kine
<dt>Up their rough path; sit by yon cottage-door
<dt>Plying the diligent thread; take wings and soar--
<dt>O hark how with the season's laureate
<dt>Joy culminates in song! If such a song were mine!
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>Places and Men</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In Sussex here, by shingle and by sand,
<dt>Flat fields and farmsteads in their wind-blown trees,
<dt>The shallow tide-wave courses to the land,
<dt>And all along the down a fringe one sees
<dt>Of ducal woods. That 'dim discovered spire'
<dt>Is Chichester, where Collins felt a fire
<dt>Touch his sad lips; thatched Felpham roofs are these,
<dt>Where happy Blake found heaven more close at hand.
<p>
<dt>Goodwood and Arundel possess their lords,
<dt>Successive in the towers and groves, which stay;
<dt>These two poor men, by some right of their own,
<dt>Possessed the earth and sea, the sun and moon,
<dt>The inner sweet of life; and put in words
<dt>A personal force that doth not pass away.
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>A Singer</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>That which he did not feel, he would not sing;
<dt>What most he felt, religion it was to hide
<dt>In a dumb darkling grotto, where the spring
<dt>Of tremulous tears, arising unespied,
<dt>Became a holy well that durst not glide
<dt>Into the day with moil or murmuring;
<dt>Whereto, as if to some unlawful thing,
<dt>He sto]e, musing or praying at its side.
<p>
<dt>But in the sun he sang with cheerful heart,
<dt>Of coloured season and the whirling sphere,
<dt>Warm household habitude and human mirth,
<dt>The whole faith-blooded mystery of earth;
<dt>And I, who had his secret, still could hear
<dt>The grotto's whisper low through every part.
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>Autumnal Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Now Autumn's fire burns slowly along the woods,
<dt>And day by day the dead leaves fall and melt,
<dt>And night by night the monitory blast
<dt>Wails in the key-hold, telling how it pass'd
<dt>O'er empty fields, or upland solitudes,
<dt>Or grim wide wave; and now the power is felt
<dt>Of melancholy, tenderer in its moods
<dt>Than any joy indulgent summer dealt.
<dt>Dear friends, together in the glimmering eve,
<dt>Pensive and glad, with tones that recognise
<dt>The soft invisible dew in each one's eyes,
<dt>It may be, somewhat thus we shall have leave
<dt>To walk with memory,--when distant lies
<dt>Poor Earth, where we were wont to live and grieve.
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>A Day-Dream's Reflection</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>("<i>On the Sunny Shore.</i>")
<p>
<dt>Chequer'd with woven shadows as I lay
<dt>Among the grass, blinking the watery gleam,
<dt>I saw an Echo-Spirit in his bay
<dt>Most idly floating in the noontide beam.
<dt>Slow heaved his filmy skiff, and fell, with sway
<dt>Of ocean's giant pulsing, and the Dream,
<dt>Buoyed like the young moon on a level stream
<dt>Of greenish vapour at decline of day,
<dt>Swam airily, watching the distant flocks
<dt>Of sea-gulls, whilst a foot in careless sweep
<dt>Touched the clear-trembling cool with tiny shocks,
<dt>Faint-circling; till at last he dropt asleep,
<dt>Lull'd by the hush-song of the glittering deep,
<dt>Lap-lapping drowsily the heated rocks.
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>After Sunset</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The vast and solemn company of clouds
<dt>Around the Sun's death, lit, incarnadined,
<dt>Cool into ashy wan; as Night enshrouds
<dt>The level pasture, creeping up behind
<dt>Through voiceless vales, o'er lawn and purpled hill
<dt>And haz&eacute;d mead, her mystery to fulfil.
<dt>Cows low from far-off farms; the loitering wind
<dt>Sighs in the hedge, you hear it if you will,--
<dt>Tho' all the wood, alive atop with wings
<dt>Lifting and sinking through the leafy nooks,
<dt>Seethes with the clamour of a thousand rooks.
<dt>Now every sound at length is hush'd away.
<dt>These few are sacred moments. One more Day
<dt>Drops in the shadowy gulf of bygone things.
