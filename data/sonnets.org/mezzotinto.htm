<p>
<dt>"It has been said of many, they were quite
<dt>Prepared to prove (I do not mean in fun)
<dt>That white was really black, and black was white;
<dt>But I believe it has not yet been done.
<dt>Black (Saxon, Blac) in any way to liken
<dt>With <i>candour</i> may seem almost out of reach;
<dt>Yet <i>whiten</i> is in kindred German <i>bleichen</i>,
<dt>Undoubtedly identical with <i>bleach</i>:
<dt>This last verb's cognate adjective is <i>bleak</i>--
<dt>Reverting to the Saxon, <i>bleak</i> is bl&aelig;k.*
<dt>A semivowel is, at the last squeak,
<dt>All that remains such difference wide to make--
<dt>The hostile terms of keen antithesis
<dt>Brought to an <i>E plus ultra</i> all but kiss!"

<p>*Pronounced (as <i>black</i> was anciently written) <i>blake</i.>
