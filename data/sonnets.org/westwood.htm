<dt>What, not a word for thee, O little tome?
<dt>Brown-jerkined, friendly-faced--of all my books
<dt>The one that wears the quaintest, kindliest looks--
<dt>Seems most completely, cosily at home,
<dt>Amongst its fellows.  Ah! if thou couldst tell
<dt>Thy story--how, in sixteen fifty-three,
<dt>Good Master Marriot, standing at his door,
<dt>Saw anglers hurrying--fifty--nay, threescore,
<dt>To buy thee, ere noon pealed from Dunstan's bell:--
<dt>And how he stared and. . . shook his sides with glee.
<dt>One story, this, which fact or fiction weaves.
<dt>Meanwhile, adorn my shelf, beloved of all--
<dt>Old book! with lavender between thy leaves,
<dt>And twenty ballads round thee on the wall.
<p>
(Text from <i>Fisherman's Verse</i> (Haynes and Harrison, eds, 1919).)
