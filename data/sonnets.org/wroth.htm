<a name=001></a><h2>"When night's black mantle could most darkness prove"</h2>
<p>
<dt>When night's black mantle could most darkness prove,
<dt>And sleep (death's image) did my senses hire
<dt>From knowledge of myself, then thoughts did move
<dt>Swifter than those, most switness need require.</P>
<p>
<P><dt>In sleep, a chariot drawn by wing'd Desire,
<dt>I saw, where sate bright Venus, Queen of love,
<dt>And at her feet her son, still adding fire
<dt>To burning hearts, which she did hold above.</P>
<p>
<P><dt>But one heart flaming more than all the rest,
<dt>The goddess held, and put it to my breast.
<dt>Dear Son, now shoot, she said, this must we win.</P>
<p>
<P><dt>He her obeyed, and martyr'd my poor heart.
<dt>I waking hop'd as dreams it would depart,
<dt>Yet since, O me, a lover have I been.</P>
<P>
<a name=002></a><h2>"Dear eyes how well (indeed) you do adorn"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Dear eyes how well (indeed) you do adorn
<dt>That blessed sphere, which gazing souls hold dear:
<dt>The loved place of sought for triumphs near:
<dt>The court of glory, where Love's force was born:
<p>
<dt>How may they term you April's sweetest morn
<dt>When pleasing looks from those bright lights appear:
<dt>A sun-shine day; from clouds, and mists still clear
<dt>Kind nursing fires for wishes yet unborn!
<p>
<dt>Two stars of Heaven, sent down to grace the Earth,
<dt>Plac'd in that throne which gives all joys their birth;
<dt>Shining, and burning; pleasing yet their charms;
<p>
<dt>Which wounding, even in hurts are deem'd delights,
<dt>So pleasant is their force!  So great their mights
<dt>As, happy, they can triumph in their harms.
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>"Yet is their hope:  Then Love but play thy part"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Yet is their hope:  Then Love but play thy part
<dt>Remember well thy self, and think on me;
<dt>Shine in those eyes which conquer'd have my heart;
<dt>And see if mine be slack to answer thee:
<p>
<dt>Lodge in that breast, and pity moving see
<dt>For flames which in mine burn in truest smart
<dt>Exiling thoughts that touch inconstancy,
<dt>Or those which waste not in the constant art,
<p>
<dt>Watch but my sleep, if I take any rest
<dt>For thought of you, my spiritt soe distressed
<dt>As pale, and famish'd, I, for mercy cry;
<p>
<dt>Will you your servant leave?  Think but on this;
<dt>Who wears love's crown, must not do so amiss,
<dt>But seek their good, who on thy force do lie.
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>"Forbear dark night, my joys now bud again"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Forbear dark night, my joys now bud again,
<dt>Lately grown dead, while cold aspects did chill
<dt>The root at heart, and my chief hope quite kill,
<dt>And thunders struck me in my pleasures' wane
<p>
<dt>Then I alas with bitter sobs, and pain,
<dt>Privately groan'd, my Fortunes present ill;
<dt>All light of comfort dimm'd, woes in prides fill,
<dt>With strange increase of grief, I griev'd in vain.
<p>
<dt>And most, when as a memory too good
<dt>Molested me, which still as witness stood,
<dt>Of those best days, in former time I knew:
<p>
<dt>Late gone as wonders past, like the great Snow,
<dt>Melted and wasted, with what, change must know:
<dt>Now back the life comes where as once it grew.
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>"Can pleasing sight misfortune ever bring"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Can pleasing sight misfortune ever bring?
<dt>Can firm desire a painful torment try?
<dt>Can winning eyes prove to the heart a sting?
<dt>Or can sweet lips in treason hidden lie?
<p>
<dt>The Sun most pleasing blinds the strongest eye
<dt>If too much look'd on, breaking the sight's string;
<dt>Desires still crossed must unto mischief hye,
<dt>And as despair, a luckless chance may fling.
<p>
<dt>Eyes, having won, rejecting proves a sting
<dt>Killing the bud before the tree doth spring;
<dt>Sweet lips not loving do as poison prove:
<p>
<dt>Desire, sight, Eyes, lips, seek, see, prove, and find
<dt>You love may win, but curses if unkind;
<dt>Then show you harm's dislike, and joy in Love.
