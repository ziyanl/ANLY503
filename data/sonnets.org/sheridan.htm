<dt>What though I hear the Aegean billows roar,
<dt>And eye the deep where Persia's navy rode,
<dt>What have I left except my native shore?
<dt>What have I changed beyond my mere abode?
<dt>The fancied future, aspirations high
<dt>Which reason scarce could quell, the upbraiding shame
<dt>Of sloth mid busy crowds, the weak desire
<dt>Of that ideal feverish want, a name,
<dt>No longer tantalize the mental eye,
<dt>When nought gives food to such tormenting fire.
<dt>Yet still the mournful memory of the past,
<dt>Clouding my spirit, throws a deeper gloom
<dt>Than even befits the scene, a nation's tomb,
<dt>And that I feel through every clime must last.

<dt>Hellas! farewell!--with anxious gaze I view,
<dt>Lovely in tears and injured as thou art,
<dt>Thy summits melting in the distant blue,
<dt>Fade from my eyes but linger in my heart.
<dt>Submissive, silent victim! dost thou feel
<dt>The chains which gall thee? or has lengthened grief
<dt>Numbed hate and shame alike with hope and zeal,
<dt>And brought insensibility's relief?
<p>
<dt>Awake I adjured by every chief and sage
<dt>Thou once couldst boast in many a meaner cause,
<dt>And let the tame submission of an age,
<dt>Like nature's hushed and scarcely rustling pause,
<dt>Ere winds burst forth, foretell the approaching storm,
<dt>When thou shalt grasp the spear, and raise thy prostrate form.
