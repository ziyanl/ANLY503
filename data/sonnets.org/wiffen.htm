<p>From <a href="http://erl.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&seq=1&size=1&id=nq.1852.2.21.6.121.x.192">Notes and Queries</a>, Feb. 21, 1852.
<a name=010></a><p><i>Remarkable Trees.--</i>Affixed to a tree in the beautiful and spacious park of Woburn Abbey, is the following sonnet; the tree, according to the local tradition, being that upon which the last abbot of that religious house was hung; or to borrow a pun from Professor Sedgwick, "They took the abbot from his house, and <i>suspended</i> him."
<p>
<dt>"O! 'twas a ruthless deed, enough to pale
<dt>Freedom's bright fires, that doom'd to shameful death
<dt>Those that maintained their faith with latest breath,
<dt>And scorn'd beneath the despot's frown to quail!
<dt>Yet 'twas a glorious hour when from the gaol
<dt>Of Papal tyranny the mind of man
<dt>Dared to break loose, and triumph in the ban
<dt>Of thunders warring in the distant gale!
<dt>Yes, old memorial of the mitred monk,
<dt>Thou livest to flourish in a brighter day;
<dt>With seeming joy, that pure and patriot vows
<dt>Are breath'd where superstition reign'd: thy trunk
<dt>Its glad green garlands wears, though in decay,
<dt>And pious red-breasts warble from thy boughs.
