<p>. . .There (after trifling with beef, mutton, puddings, pies, and so on) I got a Stilton cheese.  I was so much moved by my memories that I wrote a sonnet to the cheese.  Some critical friends have hinted to me that my sonnet is not strictly new; that it contains "echoes" (as they express it) of some other poem that they have read somewhere.  Here, at least, are the lines I wrote :--

<p>
<dt>Stilton, thou shouldst be living at this hour
<dt>And so thou art.  Nor losest grace thereby;
<dt>England has need of thee, and so have I--
<dt>She is a Fen.  Far as the eye can scour,
<dt>League after grassy league from Lincoln tower
<dt>To Stilton in the fields, she is a Fen.
<dt>Yet this high cheese, by choice of fenland men,
<dt>Like a tall green volcano rose in power.
<dt>Plain living and long drinking are no more,
<dt>And pure religion reading "Household Words",
<dt>And sturdy manhood sitting still all day
<dt>Shrink, like this cheese that crumbles to its core;
<dt>While my digestion, like the House of Lords,
<dt>The heaviest burdens on herself doth lay.

<p>I confess I feel myself as if some literary influence, something that has haunted me, were present in this otherwise original poem; but it is hopeless to disentangle it now.
