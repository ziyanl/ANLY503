<dt>I count the mercifullest part of all
<dt>God's mercies, in this coil of eighty years,
<dt>Is that no sense of being disappears
<dt>Or fails; I see the signal, hear the call,
<dt>Can calmly estimate the rise and fall
<dt>Of moth-like mortals in this "vale of tears";
<dt>And all His glorious works--the heavenly spheres,
<dt>The ocean, and the earth's unending wall--
<dt>Remain, for thought and wonder!  Marvellous
<dt>Is God's creation, with its endless space
<dt>And those inhabited bright worlds by law
<dt>Divinely governed, as they shine on us,
<dt>Still keeping through all time their ordered place;
<dt>I bow my head in rapture and in awe.
