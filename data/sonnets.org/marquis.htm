<p>
<dt>The strongest singer of these latter days
<dt>Has left the turmoil of earth's busy throng,
<dt>But his rich voice is with us, and his song
<dt>Gladdens our hearts, and on our darkest ways
<dt>Throws gleam of living light. His steady praise
<dt>Of truth and right; his lesson firm and strong--
<dt>Our lives are not our own, that they belong
<dt>To God--is here to comfort and to raise.
<p>
<dt>Then, while we weep for him, our laurelled king,
<dt>Our hearts can truly say he is not dead;
<dt>Nay, more! He sleeps not, but with undimmed mind
<dt>Still works among us, still abides to bring
<dt>Balm to the bleeding hearts whence hope has fled,
<dt>Strength to the weak, light to the groping blind.
