<a name=100></a><H2>Grey Nights</H2>
<p>
<dt>A while we wandered (thus it is I dream!)
<dt>Through a long, sandy track of No Man's Land,
<dt>Where only poppies grew among the sand,
<dt>The which we, plucking, cast with scant esteem,
<dt>And ever sadlier, into the sad stream,
<dt>Which followed us, as we went, hand in hand,
<dt>Under the estranged stars, a road unplanned,
<dt>Seeing all things in the shadow of a dream.
<p>
<dt>And ever sadlier, as the stars expired,
<dt>We found the poppies rarer, till thine eyes
<dt>Grown all my light, to light me were too tired,
<dt>And at their darkening, that no surmise
<dt>Might haunt me of the lost days we desired,
<dt>After them all I flung those memories!
<p>
<a name=200></a><H2>To One in Bedlam</H2>
<p>
<dt>With delicate, mad hands, behind his sordid bars,
<dt>Surely he hath his posies, which they tear and twine;
<dt>Those scentless wisps of straw, that miserably line
<dt>His strait, caged universe, whereat the dull world stares,
<p>
<dt>Pedant and pitiful. O, how his rapt gaze wars
<dt>With their stupidity!  Know they what dreams divine
<dt>Lift his long, laughing reveries like enchaunted wine,
<dt>And make his melancholy germane to the stars?
<p>
<dt>O, lamentable brother! if those pity thee,
<dt>Am I not fain of all thy lone eyes promise me;
<dt>Half a fool's kingdom, far from men who sow and reap,
<dt>All their days, vanity?  Better than mortal flowers,
<dt>Thy moon-kissed roses seem: better than love or sleep,
<dt>The star-crowned solitude of thine oblivious hours!
<p>

<p>
<dt>Let us go hence: the night is now at hand;
<dt>The day is overworn, the birds all flown;
<dt>And we have reaped the crops the gods have sown;
<dt>Despair and death; deep darkness o'er the land,
<dt>Broods like an owl: we cannot understand
<dt>Laughter or tears, for we have only known
<dt>Surpassing vanity: vain things alone
<dt>Have driven our perverse and aimless band.
<p>
<dt>Let us go hence, somewhither strange and cold,
<dt>To Hollow Lands where just men and unjust
<dt>Find end of labour, where's rest for the old,
<dt>Freedom to all from love and fear and lust.
<dt>Twine our torn hands!  O pray the earth enfold
<dt>Our life-sick hearts and turn them into dust.
