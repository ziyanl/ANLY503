<p><h2><i>From <a href="bibliogr.htm#sterner">The Sonnet in American Literature</a></i></h2>

<p>In a letter to <a href="taylor.htm">Bayard Taylor</a>, George Henry Boker wrote facetiously that he had written more sonnets "than any poet in the language except Wordsworth." Certain it is that, with the single exception of <a href="mifflin.htm">Lloyd Mifflin</a>, he has written more sonnets than any other American sonneteer.

<p>Of Boker's three hundred and eighty-nine sonnets, of which all but eighteen are Italian in form, three hundred and thirteen form one magnificent <a href="profane.htm">Sequence on Profane Love</a>, a sequence but recently discovered, and still more recently published. The sequence, to quote the editor's words, is, in its major part,

<blockquote>perhaps the most remarkable exposition of its sort in English poetry in both the scope of the experience recorded and the duration of the relationship. No mood has been avoided; from the platonic ideality to the fervor of physical consummation, from abject despair to the ecstacy of complete possession, the lover's experiences and emotions are clearly portrayed.</blockquote>

<dt>Lear and Cordelia! 't was an ancient tale
<dt>Before thy Shakespeare gave it deathless fame:
<dt>The times have changed, the moral is the same.
<dt>So like an outcast, dowerless, and pale,
<dt>Thy daughter went; and in a foreign gale
<dt>Spread her young banner, till its sway became
<dt>A wonder to the nations. Days of shame
<dt>Are close upon thee: prophets raise their wail.
<dt>When the rude Cossack with an outstretched hand
<dt>Points his long spear across the narrow sea,--
<dt>"Lo, there is England!" when thy destiny
<dt>Storms on thy straw-crowned head, and thou dost stand
<dt>Weak, helpless, mad, a by-word in the land,--
<dt>God grant thy daughter a Cordelia be!
<p>
<a name="england2"></a><h3>II</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Stand, thou great bulwark of man's liberty!
<dt>Thou rock of shelter, rising from the wave,
<dt>Sole refuge to the overwearied brave
<dt>Who planned, arose, and battled to be free,
<dt>Fell undeterred, then sadly turned to thee;--
<dt>Saved the free spirit from their country's grave,
<dt>To rise again, and animate the slave,
<dt>When God shall ripen all things. Britons, ye
<dt>Who guard the sacred outpost, not in vain
<dt>Hold your proud peril! Freemen undefiled,
<dt>Keep watch and ward! Let battlements be piled
<dt>Around your cliffs; fleets marshalled, till the main
<dt>Sinks under them; and if your courage wane,
<dt>Through force or fraud, look westward to your child.

<dt>Where is my merit? By what special grace
<dt>Am I so blessed above all other men?
<dt>I have some fancy, and the art to pen
<dt>A halting sonnet to thy perfect face.
<dt>But what of that? The thrush or twittering wren
<dt>Makes sweeter music from his resting-place.
<dt>No outward beauty in my life I trace.
<dt>No thought or deed heroical; and when
<dt>My eyes turn inward, I am stricken blind
<dt>At the abyss of weakness, folly, sin,
<dt>That like a miner's shaft, sinks far within
<dt>My darkened nature. Nowhere can I find
<dt>Cause for thy love. Rest, rest, my troubled mind!
<dt>Where reason stops, let soaring faith begin.

<p></p>
<dt>I strive to live my life in whitest truth,
<dt>Even in the face of this deceitful world;
<dt>And if in errors I am caught and whirled
<dt>From the fair courses of my candid youth,
<dt>I view my trespasses with thoughtful ruth;
<dt>And the poor mummer's scornful lip is curled,
<dt>And a low curse indignantly is hurled
<dt>At arts which others blindly take as sooth.
<dt>But when I enter thy pure presence, Sweet,
<dt>I come as one into a holy shrine.
<dt>I taste the mystic wafer and the wine,
<dt>And fraud and falsehood from my heart retreat.
<dt>Through thy divinity I grow divine,
<dt>And my world's mask lies empty at thy feet.

<dt>Nothing is stable. Though the deeds we do
<dt>May bind the nations in a servile chain,
<dt>And give to cowering slaves their joy and pain,
<dt>The far result still frowns in open view.
<dt>A little wound will let great Caesar through,
<dt>An asp make Egypt's dusky charmer plain;
<dt>And all the power and beauty that remain
<dt>Go shivering naked up the mystic blue.
<dt>Earth smiles at tyrants, when the crown is laid
<dt>Upon the coffin, and their history
<dt>To after times with laughter is displayed.
<dt>Death and oblivion are the proudest fee
<dt>Of men's endeavor; and the delver's spade
<dt>Rounds all our hillocks fair and evenly.

<p></p>
<dt>When with the courage lent me by thy smile,
<dt>I laid my hands upon thy sacred form,
<dt>Dared, passion-wild, thy scented mouth to warm
<dt>With cleaving kisses, unrepelled the while;
<dt>Was it thy patience or my venturous guile
<dt>Shook virtue's outworks with a fiery storm,
<dt>And made her guards the trembling ramparts swarm,
<dt>To meet a foe who came in friendly stile?
<dt>I know not, Love; but since that trustful day
<dt>I grow more careful of myself, less stained
<dt>By wor[l]dly touch, as though that touch profaned.
<dt>I am all thine, more like thee; if thou'lt say
<dt>Those kisses brushed thy purese bloom away,
<dt>Say also this, that what thou lost, I gained.

<dt>Love sat at ease upon Time's bony knee;
<dt>Pulled his grey beard; paddled his finger-tips
<dt>Among his wrinkles; smote his bloodless lips;
<dt>With rosy palms, forbade his eyes to see;
<dt>O'erturned his fatal hour-glass; wantonly
<dt>Pulled his scythe-edge against that dart which rips
<dt>The heart of adamant; cast gibes and quips
<dt>Straight in his teeth, out-mocking mockery.
<dt>What said this phantom? Nought; he only smiled
<dt>To be thus toyed with; held his wasting breath,
<dt>Lest he might do some damage to the child;
<dt>Till Love, grown weary of that pastime, saith,
<dt>"This is too tame; my heart with joy is wild;
<dt>Come, Father, come! Let us go play with Death!"
