  "Why should I sing in verse..."
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Why should I sing in verse, why should I frame
<dt>
These sad neglected notes for her dear sake?
<dt>
Why should I offer up unto her name
<dt>
The sweetest sacrifice my youth can make?
<dt>
Why should I strive to make her live forever,
<dt>
That never deigns to give me joy to live?
<dt>
Why should m'afflicted muse so much endeavor
<dt>
Such honor unto cruelty to give?
<dt>
If her defects have purchased her this fame,
<dt>
What should her virtues do, her smiles, her love?
<dt>
If this her worst, how should her best inflame?
<dt>
What passions would her milder favors move?
<dt>
Favors, I think, would sense quite overcome,
<dt>
And that makes happy lovers ever dumb.

  "But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again,
<dt>
Now whilst thy May hath filled thy lap with flowers,
<dt>
Now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain;
<dt>
Now use the summer smiles ere winter lours.
<dt>
And whilst thou spread'st unto the rising sun
<dt>
The fairest flower that ever saw the light,
<dt>
Now joy thy time before thy sweet be done;
<dt>
And, Delia, think thy morning must have night,
<dt>
And that thy brightness sets at length to west,
<dt>
When thou wilt close up that which now thou show'st,
<dt>
And think the same becomes thy fading best,
<dt>
Which then shall most inveil and shadow most.
<dt>
Men do not weigh the stalk for that it was,
<dt>
When once they find her flower, her glory, pass.

  "When winter snows upon thy sable hairs"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
When winter snows upon thy sable hairs,
<dt>
And frost of age hath nipped thy beauties near,
<dt>
When dark shall seem thy day that never clears,
<dt>
And all lies withered that was held so dear,
<dt>
Then take this picture which I here present thee,
<dt>
Limned with a pencil not all unworthy;
<dt>
Here see the gifts that God and nature lent thee,
<dt>
Here read thyself and what I suffered for thee.
<dt>
This may remain thy lasting monument,
<dt>
Which happily posterity may cherish;
<dt>
These colors with thy fading are not spent,
<dt>
These may remain when thou and I shall perish.
<dt>
If they remain, then thou shalt live thereby;
<dt>
They will remain, and so thou canst not die.

  "Thou canst not die whilst any zeal abound"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Thou canst not die whilst any zeal abound
<dt>
In feeling hearts that can conceive these lines;
<dt>
Though thou, a Laura, hast no Petrarch found,
<dt>
In base attire yet clearly beauty shines.
<dt>
And I, though born within a colder clime,
<dt>
Do feel mine inward heat as great (I know it),
<dt>
He never had more faith, although more rhyme;
<dt>
I love as well, though he could better show it.
<dt>
But I may add one feather to thy fame,
<dt>
To help her flight throughout the fairest isle,
<dt>
And if my pen could more enlarge thy name,
<dt>
Then shouldst thou live in an immortal style.
<dt>
For though that Laura better limned be,
<dt>
Suffice, thou shalt be loved as well as she.

  "Most fair and lovely maid, look from the shore"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Most fair and lovely maid, look from the shore,
<dt>
See thy Leander striving in these waves,
<dt>
Poor soul, quite spent, whose force can do no more;
<dt>
Now send forth hope, for now calm pity saves,
<dt>
And waft him to thee with these lovely eyes,
<dt>
A happy convoy to a holy land.
<dt>
Now show thy power and where thy virtue lies;
<dt>
To save thine own, stretch out the fairest hand.
<dt>
Stretch out the fairest hand, a pledge of peace,
<dt>
That hand that darts so right and never misses;
<dt>
I shall forget old wrongs, my griefs shall cease;
<dt>
And that which gave me wounds, I'll give it kisses,
<dt>
Once let the ocean of my cares find shore,
<dt>
That thou be pleased, and I may sigh no more.

  "Beauty, sweet love, is like the morning dew"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Beauty, sweet love, is like the morning dew,
<dt>
Whose short refresh upon the tender green
<dt>
Cheers for a time, but till the sun doth shew,
<dt>
And straight 'tis gone as it had never been.
<dt>
Soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish,
<dt>
Short is the glory of the blushing rose;
<dt>
The hue which thou so carefully dost nourish,
<dt>
Yet which at length thou must be forced to lose,
<dt>
When thou, surcharged with the burthen of thy years,
<dt>
Shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth,
<dt>
And that in beauty's lease expired appears
<dt>
The date of age, the kalends of our death.
<dt>
But ah! no more, this must not be foretold,
<dt>
For women grieve to think they must be old.

  "None other fame mine unambitious muse"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
None other fame mine unambitious muse
<dt>
Affected ever but t' eternize thee;
<dt>
All other honors do my hopes refuse,
<dt>
Which meaner prized and momentary be.
<dt>
For God forbid I should my papers blot
<dt>
With mercenary lines, with servile pen,
<dt>
Praising virtues in them that have them not,
<dt>
Basely attending on the hopes of men.
<dt>
No, no, my verse respects nor Thames nor theaters,
<dt>
Nor seeks it to be known unto the great;
<dt>
But Avon, poor in fame and poor in waters,
<dt>
Shall have my song, where Delia hath her seat.
<dt>
Avon shall be my Thames and she my song;
<dt>
No other prouder brooks shall hear my wrong.

  "Lo, here the impost of a faith entire"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Lo, here the impost of a faith entire
<dt>
Which love doth pay and her disdain extorts;
<dt>
Behold the message of a chaste desire
<dt>
Which tells the world how much my grief imports.
<dt>
These tributary passions, beauty's due,
<dt>
I send those eyes, the cabinets of love,
<dt>
That cruelty herself might grieve to view
<dt>
Th' affliction her unkind disdain doth move,
<dt>
And how I live, cast down from off all mirth,
<dt>
Pensive, alone, only but with despair;
<dt>
My joys, abortive, perish in their birth;
<dt>
My griefs long lived, and care succeeding care.
<dt>
This is my state, and Delia's heart is such;
<dt>
I say no more, I fear I said too much.
<P>
<A name=100></A>
<H2>
  "If this be love, to draw a weary breath"
</H2>
<P>
<dt>
If this be love, to draw a weary breath,
<dt>
To paint on floods till the shore cry to th'air,
<dt>
With downward looks, still reading on the earth
<dt>
The sad memorials of my love's despair;
<dt>
If this be love, to war against my soul,
<dt>
Lie down to wail, rise up to sigh and grieve,
<dt>
The never-resting stone of care to roll,
<dt>
Still to complain my griefs whilst none relieve;
<dt>
If this be love, to clothe me with dark thoughts,
<dt>
Haunting untrodden paths to wail apart;
<dt>
My pleasures horror, music tragic notes,
<dt>
Tears in mine eyes and sorrow at my heart.
<dt>
If this be love, to live a living death,
<dt>
Then do I love and draw this weary breath.
<P>
