<p>
<dt>Along my father's dykes I roam again,
<dt>Among the willows by the river-side.
<dt>These miles of green I know from hill to tide
<dt>And every creek and river's ruddy stain.
<dt>Neglected long and shunned our dead have lain,
<dt>Here where a people's dearest hope had died.
<dt>Alone of all their children scattered wide,
<dt>I scan the sad memorials that remain.
<dt>The dykes wave with the grass, but not for me;
<dt>The oxen stir not while this stranger calls.
<dt>From these new homes upon the green hill-side,
<dt>Where speech is strange and a new people free,
<dt>No voice cries out in welcome; for these halls
<dt>Give food and shelter where I may not bide.

<p></p>
<dt>From the soft dyke-road, crooked and wagon-worn,
<dt>Comes the great load of rustling scented hay,
<dt>Slow-drawn with heavy swing and creaky sway,
<dt>Through the cool freshness of the windless morn.
<dt>The oxen, yoked and sturdy, horn to horn,
<dt>Sharing the rest and toil of night and day,
<dt>Bend head and neck to the long hilly way,
<dt>By many a season's labour marked and torn.
<dt>On the broad sea of dyke, the gathering heat
<dt>Waves upward from the grass, where road on road
<dt>Is swept before the tramping of the teams.
<dt>And while the oxen rest beside the sweet
<dt>New hay, the loft receives the early load,
<dt>With hissing stir, among the dusty beams.</dt>
