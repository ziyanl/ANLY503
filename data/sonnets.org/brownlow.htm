<p>
<dt>The sonnet is a diamond flashing round
<dt>From every facet true rare coloured lights;
<dt>A gem of thought carved in poetic nights
<dt>To grace the brow of art by fancy crowned;
<dt>A miniature of soul wherein are found
<dt>Marvels of beauty and resplendent sights;
<dt>A drop of blood with which a lover writes
<dt>His heart's sad epitaph in its own bound;
<dt>A pearl gained from dark waters when the deep
<dt>Rocked in its frenzied passion; the last note
<dt>Heard from a heaven-saluting skylark's throat;
<dt>A cascade small flung in a canyon steep
<dt>With crystal music. At this shrine of song
<dt>High priests of poesy have worshipped long.

<p>
<dt>There is a playwright older than the years,
<dt>Who maketh all men actors in his play,
<dt>And, though they know not what they do or say,
<dt>The purpose of the plot in all appears.
<dt>Each in his turn, beset with inborn fears,
<dt>Enters unseen youth's comedy so gay,
<dt>Laughs through the hours that glide too soon away
<dt>Beneath the clouds of soul-consuming tears.
<dt>Then manhood's tragedy with perils fraught,
<dt>Pursues its fickle fortunes to the end,
<dt>When Fate, the villain of the piece doth send
<dt>By whom the last exciting scene is wrought;
<dt>A timely stab from Death's sure-falling knife
<dt>Brings down the curtain o'er the play of life.

<p>
<dt>Vine tendrils drooping in the midday sun
<dt>Take me to Greece, ere Sappho sang those lays,
<dt>Whose echoes, falling down this length of days,
<dt>Trance us with beauty, sweet and halcyon;
<dt>Satyrs, green-garlanded, skip madly on
<dt>Through woody wilds, loud shouts of ribald praise
<dt>Mingle with merry laughter, and amaze
<dt>The peaceful shepherds, who, affrighted, run;
<dt>Fair dryads swell the riot-filling song
<dt>From every tree-trunk, and from each pure spring
<dt>Sweet naiad voices rise with silvery ring
<dt>To welcome him who leads the dancing throng,
<dt>Old Bacchus! reeling 'neath the weight of wine,
<dt>Chanting a stave, half drunken, half divine.
