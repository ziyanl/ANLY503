    "Born in Sioux City Iowa, in 1871, he has already 
printed verse in various periodicals, a poem written at the age of fifteen being 
accepted by the <em>Critic</em>         
           
                
    .&nbsp; He resides in Tacoma, Wash.&nbsp; The sonnet is

<h2>One   Autumn Night</h2>
<p>
<dt>Can I forget that glorious autumn night,
<dt>So full of joyous pain, when you and I
<dt>Stood on the shore beneath a cloudless sky,
<dt>And watched the moon, all drenched with holy light,
<dt>Sail slowly up, and toss a veil of white
<dt>Across the heaving sea?—when waves rode by
<dt>    And pressed broad palms upon the rocks, to try
<dt>    And bear away the rough stone from our sight?
<p></p>        
<dt>    Ah, no! 'twas then I spoke to you of love,—
<dt>    My secret which you long ere that had guessed;
<dt>    'Twas then I first&nbsp;knew passion's fiery heat
<dt>    And kissed your cheek, your lips, while high above
<dt>    A great star shook, and in its burning breast,
<dt>    As in my own, a red    heart beat and beat.&nbsp;
<dt>
