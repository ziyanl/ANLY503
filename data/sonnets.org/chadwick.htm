<h2>The Hardest Lot</h2>
<p>
<dt>To look upon the face of a dead friend
<dt>Is hard; but 'tis not more than we can bear
<dt>If, haply, we can see peace written there,--
<dt>Peace after pain, and welcome so the end,
<dt>Whate'er the past, whatever death may send.
<dt>Yea, and that face a gracious smile may wear,
<dt>If love till death was perfect, sweet, and fair;
<dt>But there is woe from which may God defend:
<dt>To look upon our friendship lying dead,
<dt>While we live on, and eat, and drink, and sleep--
<dt>Mere bodies from which all the soul has fled--
<dt>And that dead thing year after year to keep
<dt>Locked in cold silence in its dreamless bed:--
<dt>There must be hell while there is such a deep.
