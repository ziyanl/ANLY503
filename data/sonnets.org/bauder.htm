<p>
<dt>Seems there a hand outstretched to bar the way,
<dt>A voice that says, "This door to you is closed;"
<dt>Are all your plans mysteriously opposed,
<dt>Your course of progress hampered by delay?
<dt>Seems chance to you but mischance, with no ray
<dt>Of clear good-fortune through the clouds disclosed,
<dt>Though some appear to thrive who idly dozed
<dt>While you were up and doing with the day?
<dt>        
<dt>So seems it to us all.&nbsp; Though long delayed,
<dt>Your time will come, so labor and be wise;
<dt>So came the Indian's, who had sought the aid
<dt>  Of a small shrub—it failed him—in surprise
<dt>He frowned—but there, in glittering veins displayed,
<dt>   Potosi's mine of silver met his eyes!
