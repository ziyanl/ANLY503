<h2><a name="morning"></a>    Morning</h2>
<p>
<dt>I woke and heard the thrushes sing at dawn,—
<dt>   A strangely blissful burst of melody,
<dt>   A chant of rare, exultant certainty,
<dt> Fragrant, as springtime breaths, of wood and lawn.
<dt>  Night's eastern curtains still were closely drawn;
<dt>  No roseate flush predicted pomps to be,
<dt>  Or spoke of morning loveliness to me,
<dt>But, for those happy birds,—the night was gone!
<p></p>        
<dt> Darkling they sang, nor guessed what care consumes
<dt>   Man's questioning spirit; heedless of decay,
<dt>They   sang of joy and dew-embalmèd blooms.
<dt>My doubts grew still,   doubts seemed so poor while they,
<dt>Sweet   worshipers of light, from leafy glooms
<dt>   Poured forth transporting prophecies of day.
<dt>
<h2><a name="let"></a>Let Me Believe</h2>        
<dt>Let me believe   you, love, or let me die!
<dt>If on your   faith I may not rest secure,
<dt>   Beyond all chance of peradvenure sure,
<dt>Trusting   your half avowals sweet and shy,
<dt>As trusts   the lark the pallid, dawn-lit sky
<dt>Then would   I rather in some grave obscure
<dt>   Repose forlorn, than, living on, endure
<dt>A   question each dear transport to belie.
<p></p>               
<dt>It is a   pain to thirst and do without
<dt>A pain   to suffer what we deem unjust,
<dt>To win a joy   and lay it in the dust;
<dt>But there's   a fiercer pain,—the pain of doubt:
<dt>From other   griefs Death sets the spirit free:
<dt>   Doubt steals the light from immortality!
<dt>
<h2><a name="sappho"></a>Sappho</h2>        
<dt>As a   wan weaver in an attic dim,
<dt>Hopeless yet   patient, so he may be fed
<dt>With scanty store of sorrow-seasoned bread,
<dt>Heareth   a blithe bird carol over him,
<dt>And sees   no longer walls and rafters grim,
<dt>But rural   lanes where little feet are led
<dt>Through   springing flowers, fields with clover spread,
<dt>Clouds, swan-like,   that o'er depths of azure swim,—
<p></p>        
<dt>So when upon our earth-dulled ear new breaks
<dt>Some fragment, Sappho, of thy skyey song,
<dt>A noble wonder in our souls awakes;
<dt>The deathless Beautiful draws strangely nigh,
<dt>And we look up and marvel how so long
<dt>We were content to drudge for sordid joys that die.

<h2><a name="air"></a>The Unconquered Air</h2>        
<h3>I</h3>        
<dt>        
<h3>(1906)</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>        

<p></p>Others endure Man's rule: he therefore deems
  <dt>        

I shall endure it—I the unconquered Air!
  <dt>        

Imagines this triumphant strength may bear
  <dt>        

His paltry sway!&nbsp; yea, ignorantly dreams,
  <dt>        

Because proud Rhea now his vassal seems,
  <dt>        

And Neptune him obeys in billowy lair,
  <dt>        

That he a more sublime assault may dare,
  <dt>        

Where blown by tempest wild the vulture screams!
  <dt>        

Presumptuous, he mounts:&nbsp; I toss his bones
  <dt>        

Back from the height supernal he has braved:
  <dt>        

Ay, as his vessel nears my perilous zones,
  <dt>        

I blow the cockle-shell away like chaff
  <dt>        

And give him to the Sea he has enslaved.
  <dt>        

He founders in its depths; and then I laugh!
  <dt>
  <h3>II</h3>
  <dt>
  <h3>(1911)</h3>
  <dt>        

Impregnable I held myself, secure
  <dt>        

Against intrusion.&nbsp; Who can measure Man?
  <dt>        

How should I guess his mortal will outran
  <dt>        

Defeat so far that danger could allure
  <dt>        

For its own sake?—that he would all endure,
  <dt>        

All sacrifice, all suffer, rather than
  <dt>        

Forego the daring dreams Olympian
  <dt>        

That prophesy to him of victory sure?
  <dt>        

Ah, tameless Courage!—dominating power
  <dt>        

That, all attempting, in a deathless hour
  <dt>        

Made earth-born Titans godlike, in revolt!—
  <dt>        

Fear is the fire that melts Icarian wings:
  <dt>        

Who fears nor Fate, nor Time, nor what Time brings,
  <dt>        

May drive Apollo's steeds, or wield the thunderbolt!
