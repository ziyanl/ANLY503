<a name=001></a><h2>The Singer</h2>
<p>
<dt>"That was the thrush's last good-night," I thought,
<dt>And heard the soft descent of summer rain
<dt>In the drooped garden leaves; but hush! again
<dt>The perfect iterence,--freer than unsought
<dt>Odours of violets dim in woodland ways,
<dt>Deeper than coiled waters laid a-dream
<dt>Below mossed ledges of a shadowy stream,
<dt>And faultless as blown roses in June days.
<dt>Full-throated singer! art thou thus anew
<dt>Voiceful to hear how round thyself alone
<dt>The enriched silence drops for thy delight
<dt>More soft than snow, more sweet than honey-dew?
<dt>Now cease: the last faint western streak is gone,
<dt>Stir not the blissful quiet of the night.

<a name=002></a><h2>Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I have wept tears, and learnt, I fear, sad ways
<dt>Of searching for a smile, and I can guess
<dt>The secret of a wan mouth's droopingness,
<dt>And know which eyes are they that waste their gaze
<dt>On the hid grave of hop--yet ne'er the less
<dt>My heart leaps up to utter thanks, and bless
<dt>Our earth which bears sweet flowers, and the glad face
<dt>Of these unwearied waters--thanks to them
<dt>For brief, intense, bright moments when we see
<dt>Our life stand clear in joy, we kiss the hem
<dt>Of God's robe in a rapture, and are whole--
<dt>On wind-swept hill-tops, by the mystery
<dt>Of ocean on still morns, or when the soul
<dt>Springs to the lark in a fine ecstasy.
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>Brother Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When thou would'st have me go with thee, O Death,
<dt>Over the utmost verge, to the dim place,
<dt>Practise upon me with no amorous grace
<dt>Of fawning lips, and words of delicate breath,
<dt>And curious music thy lute uttereth;
<dt>Nor think for me there must be sought-out ways
<dt>Of cloud and terror; have we many days
<dt>Sojourned together, and is this thy faith?
<dt>Nay, be there plainness 'twixt us; come to me
<dt>Even as thou art, O brother of my soul;
<dt>Hold thy hand out and I will place mine there;
<dt>I trust thy mouth's inscrutable irony,
<dt>And dare to lay my forehead where the whole
<dt>Shadow lies deep of thy purpureal hair.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>A Peach</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If any sense in mortal dust remains
<dt>When mine has been refined from flower to flower,
<dt>Won from the sun all colours, drunk the shower
<dt>And delicate winy dews, and gained the gains
<dt>Which elves who sleep in airy bells, a-swing
<dt>Through half a summer day, for love bestow,
<dt>Then in some warm old garden let me grow
<dt>To such a perfect, lush, ambrosian thing
<dt>As this.  Upon a southward-facing wall
<dt>I bask, and feel my juices dimly fed
<dt>And mellowing, while my bloom comes golden grey:
<dt>Keep the wasps from me! but before I fall
<dt>Pluck me, white fingers, and o'er two ripe-red
<dt>Girl lips O let me richly swoon away!
<p>
<a name=101></a><h2>In the Cathedral</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The altar-lights burn low, the incense-fume
<dt>Sickens:  O listen, how the priestly prayer
<dt>Runs as a fenland stream; a dim despair
<dt>Hails through their chaunt of praise, who here inhume
<dt>A clay-cold Faith within its carven tomb.
<dt>But come thou forth into the vital air
<dt>Keen, dark, and pure! grave Night is no betrayer,
<dt>And if perchance some faint cold star illume
<dt>Her brow of mystery, shall we walk forlorn?
<dt>An altar of the natural rock may rise
<dt>Somewhere for men who seek; there may be borne
<dt>On the night-wind authentic prophecies:
<dt>If not, let this--to breathe sane breath--suffice,
<dt>Till in yon East, mayhap, the dark be worn.
<p>
<a name=102></a><h2>Durer's "Melencholia"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The bow of promise, this last flaring star,
<dt>Terror and hope are in mid-heaven; but She,
<dt>The mighty-wing'd crown'd Lady Melancholy,
<dt>Heeds not.  O to what vision'd goal afar
<dt>Does her thought bear those steadfast eyes which are
<dt>A torch in darkness?  There nor shore nor sea,
<dt>Nor ebbing Time vexes Eternity,
<dt>Where that lone thought outsoars the mortal bar.
<dt>Tools of the brain--the globe, the cube--no more
<dt>She deals with; in her hand the compass stays;
<dt>Nor those, industrious genius, of her lore
<dt>Student and scribe, thou gravest of the fays,
<dt>Expect this secret to enlarge thy store;
<dt>She moves through incommunicable ways.
<p>
<a name=103></a><h2>Leonardo's "Monna Lisa"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Make thyself known, Sibyl, or let despair
<dt>Of knowing thee be absolute; I wait
<dt>Hour-long and waste a soul.  What word of fate
<dt>Hides 'twixt the lips which smile and still forbear?
<dt>Secret perfection!  Mystery too fair!
<dt>Tangle the sense no more lest I should hate
<dt>Thy delicate tyranny, the inviolate
<dt>Poise of thy folded hands, thy fallen hair.
<dt>Nay, nay,--I wrong thee with rough words; still be
<dt>Serene, victorious, inaccessible;
<dt>Still smile but speak not; lightest irony
<dt>Lurk ever 'neath thine eyelids' shadow; still
<dt>O'ertop our knowledge; Sphinx of Italy
<dt>Allure us and reject us at thy will!
<p>
<a name=104></a><h2>Darwinism in Morals</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>High instincts, dim perversions, sacred fears,
<dt>--Whence issuing?  Are they but the brain's amassed
<dt>Tradition, shapings of a barbarous past,
<dt>Remoulded ever by the younger years,
<dt>Mixed with fresh clay, and kneaded with new tears?
<dt>No more?  The dead chief's ghost a shadow cast
<dt>Across the roving clan, and thence at last
<dt>Comes God, who in the soul His law uprears?
<dt>Is this the whole?  Has not the Future powers
<dt>To match the Past,--attractions, pulsings, tides,
<dt>And voices for purged ears?  Is all our light
<dt>The glow of ancient sunsets and lost hours?
<dt>Advance no banners up heaven's eastern sides?
<dt>Trembles the margin with no portent bright?
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>An Interior</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The grass around my limbs is deep and sweet;
<dt>Yonder the house has lost its shadow wholly,
<dt>The blinds are dropped, and softly now and slowly
<dt>The day flows in and floats; a calm retreat
<dt>Of tempered light where fair things fair things meet;
<dt>White busts and marble Dian make it holy,
<dt>Within a niche hangs Durer's Melancholy
<dt>Brooding; and, should you enter, there will greet
<dt>Your sense with vague allurement effluence faint
<dt>Of one magnolia bloom; fair fingers draw
<dt>From the piano Chopin's heart-complaint;
<dt>Alone, white-robed she sits; a fierce macaw
<dt>On the verandah, proud of plume and paint,
<dt>Screams, insolent despot, showing beak and claw.
<p>
<a name=201></a><h2>Evening, Near the Sea</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Light ebbs from off the Earth; the fields are strange,
<dt>Dark, trackless, tenantless; now the mute sky
<dt>Resigns itself to Night and Memory,
<dt>And no wind will yon sunken clouds derange,
<dt>No glory enrapture them; from cot or grange
<dt>The rare voice ceases; one long-breathed sigh,
<dt>And steeped in summer sleep the world must lie;
<dt>All things are acquiescing in the change.
<dt>Hush! while the vaulted hollow of the night
<dt>Deepens, what voice is this the sea sends forth,
<dt>Disconsolate iterance, a passionless moan?
<dt>Ah! now the Day is gone, and tyrannous Light
<dt>And the calm presence of fruit-bearing Earth:
<dt>Cry, Sea! it is thy hour; thou art alone.
<p>
<a name=202></a><h2>Awakening</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>With brain o'erworn, with heart a summer clod,
<dt>With eye so practised in each form around,--
<dt>And all forms mean,--to glance above the ground
<dt>Irks it, each day of many days we plod,
<dt>Tongue-tied and deaf, along life's common road;
<dt>But suddenly, we know not how, a sound
<dt>Of living streams, an odour, a flower crowned
<dt>With dew, a lark upspringing from the sod,
<dt>And we awake. O joy of deep amaze!
<dt>Beneath the everlasting hills we stand,
<dt>We hear the voices of the morning seas,
<dt>And earnest prophesyings in the land,
<dt>While from the open heaven leans forth at gaze
<dt>The encompassing great cloud of witnesses.
<p>
<a name=203></a><h2>Two Infinities</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A lonely way, and as I went my eyes
<dt>Could not unfasten from the Spring's sweet things,
<dt>Lush-sprouted grass, and all that climbs and clings
<dt>In loose, deep hedges, where the primrose lies
<dt>In her own fairness, buried blooms surprise
<dt>The plunderer bee and stop his murmurings,
<dt>And the glad flutter of a finch's wings
<dt>Outstartle small blue-speckled butterflies.
<dt>Blissfully did one speedwell plot beguile
<dt>My whole heart long; I loved each separate flower,
<dt>Kneeling. I looked up suddenly--Dear God!
<dt>There stretched the shining plain for many a mile,
<dt>The mountains rose with what invincible power!
<dt>And how the sky was fathomless and broad!
