<p>
<dt>With hands that folded are from every task,
<dt>It must be sweet, O thou my dead, to lie
<dt>Sealed with the seal of the great mystery,--
<dt>The lips that nothing answer, nothing ask;
<dt>The life-long struggle ended; ended quite
<dt>The weariness of patience and of pain;
<dt>And the eyes closed to open not again
<dt>On desolate dawn or dreariness of night.
<dt>It must be sweet to slumber and forget;
<dt>To have the poor tired heart so still at last:
<dt>Done with all yearning, done with all regret;
<dt>Doubt, fear, hope, sorrow, all for ever past:
<dt>Past all the hours, or slow of wing or fleet--
<dt>It must be sweet, it must be very sweet!
