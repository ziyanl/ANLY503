<p>
<dt>That nose is out of drawing. With a gasp,
<dt>She pants upon the passionate lips that ache
<dt>With the red drain of her own mouth, and make
<dt>A monochord of colour. Like an asp,
<dt>One lithe lock wriggles in his rutilant grasp.
<dt>Her bosom is an oven of myrrh, to bake
<dt>Love's white warm shewbread to a browner cake.
<dt>The lock his fingers clench has burst its hasp.
<dt>The legs are absolutely abominable.
<dt>Ah! what keen overgust of wild-eyed woes
<dt>Flags in that bosom, flushes in that nose?
<dt>Nay! Death sets riddles for desire to spell,
<dt>Responsive. What red hem earth's passion sews,
<dt>But may be ravenously untripped in hell?
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>Love and Sleep</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lying asleep between the strokes of night
<dt>I saw my love lean over my sad bed,
<dt>Pale as the duskiest lily's leaf or head,
<dt>Smooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite,
<dt>Too wan for blushing and too warm for white,
<dt>But perfect-colored without white or red.
<dt>And her lips opened amorously, and said--
<dt>I wist not what, saving one word--Delight,
<dt>And all her face was honey to my mouth,
<dt>And all her body pasture to mine eyes;
<dt>The long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire,
<dt>The quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south,
<dt>The bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs
<dt>And glittering eyelids of my soul's desire.
<p>
<a name=101></a><h2>Hope and Fear</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Beneath the shadow of dawn's a&euml;rial cope,
<dt>With eyes enkindled as the sun's own sphere,
<dt>Hope from the front of youth in godlike cheer
<dt>Looks Godward, past the shades where blind men grope
<dt>Round the dark door that prayers nor dreams can ope,
<dt>And makes for joy the very darkness dear
<dt>That gives her wide wings play; nor dreams that fear
<dt>At noon may rise and pierce the heart of hope.
<dt>Then, when the soul leaves off to dream and yearn,
<dt>May truth first purge her eyesight to discern
<dt>What, once being known, leaves time no power to appall;
<dt>Till yoiuth at last, ere yet youth be not, learn
<dt>The kind wise word that falls from years that fall--
<dt>"Hope thou not much, and fear thou not at all."
<p>

<p>
<dt>Two souls diverse out of our human sight
<dt>Pass, followed one with love and each with wonder:
<dt>The stormy sophist with his mouth of thunder,
<dt>Clothed with loud words and mantled in the might
<dt>Of darkness and magnificence of night;
<dt>And one whose eye could smite the night in sunder,
<dt>Searching if light or no light were thereunder,
<dt>And found in love of loving-kindness light.
<dt>Duty divine and Thought with eyes of fire,
<dt>Still following Righteousness with deep desire,
<dt>Shone sole and stern before her and above--
<dt>Sure stars and sole to steer by; but more sweet
<dt>Shone lower the loveliest lamp for earthly feet--
<dt>The light of little children, and their love.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Chief in thy generation born of men,
<dt>Whom English praise acclaimed as English-born,
<dt>With eyes that matched the worldwide eyes of morn
<dt>For gleam of tears or laughter, tenderest then
<dt>When thoughts of children warmed their light, or when
<dt>Reverence of age with love and labor worn,
<dt>Or godlike pity fired with godlike scorn,
<dt>Shot through them flame that winged thy swift live pen:
<dt>Where stars and suns that we behold not burn,
<dt>Higher even thatn here, though highest was here thy place,
<dt>Love sees thy spirit laugh and speak and shine
<dt>With Shakespeare and the soft bright sould of Sterne
<dt>And Fielding's kindliest might and Goldsmith's grace;
<dt>Scarce one more loved or worthier love than thine.

<h3>(<i>Written June, 1882</i>)</h3>
<p>
<dt>O son of man, by lying tongues adored, 
<dt>By slaughterous hands of slaves with feet red-shod
<dt>In carnage deep as ever Christian trod
<dt>Profaned with prayer and sacrifice abhorred
<dt>And incense from the trembling tyrant's horde,
<dt>Brute worshippers of wielders of the rod,
<dt>Most murderous even of all that call thee God,
<dt>Most treacherous even that ever called thee Lord;--
<dt>Face loved of little children long ago,
<dt>Head hated of the priests and rulers then,
<dt>If thou see this, or hear these hounds of thine
<dt>Run ravening as the Gadarean swine,
<dt>Say, was not this thy Passion to foreknow
<dt>In death's worst hour the works of Christian men?
<p>
<a name=201></a><h2>Christopher Marlowe</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Crowned, girdled, garbed and shod with light and fire,
<dt>Son first-born of the morning, sovereign star!
<dt>Soul nearest ours of all, that wert most far,
<dt>Most far off in the abysm of time, thy lyre
<dt>Hung highest above the dawn-enkindled quire
<dt>Where all ye sang together, all that are,
<dt>And all the starry songs behind thy car
<dt>Rang sequence, all our souls acclaim thee sire.
<dt>"If all the pens that ever poets held
<dt>Had fed the feeling of their masters' thoughts,"
<dt>And as with rush of hurtling chariots
<dt>The flight of all their spirits were impelled
<dt>Toward one great end, thy glory--nay, not then,
<dt>Not yet might'st thou be praised enough of men.
<p>
<a name=201></a><h2>William Shakespeare</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Not if men's tongues and angels' all in one
<dt>Spake, might the word be said that might speak thee.
<dt>Streams, winds, woods, flowers, fields, mountains, yea, the sea,
<dt>What power is in them all to praise the sun?
<dt>His praise is this--he can be praised of none.
<dt>Man, woman, child, praise God for him; but he
<dt>Exults not to be worshiped, but to be.
<dt>He is; and, being, beholds his work well done.
<dt>All joy, all glory, all sorrow, all strength, all mirth,
<dt>Are his; without him, day were night on earth.
<dt>Time knows not his from time's own period.
<dt>All lutes, all harps, all viols, all flutes, all lyres,
<dt>Fall dumb before him ere one string suspires.
<dt>All stars are angels; but the sun is God.
<p>
<a name=203></a><h2>Ben Jonson</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Broad-based, broad-fronted, bounteous, multiform,
<dt>With many a valley impleached with ivy and vine,
<dt>Wherein the springs of all the streams run wine,
<dt>And many a crag full-faced against the storm,
<dt>The mountain where thy Muse's feet made warm
<dt>Those lawns that reveled with her dance divine
<dt>Shines yet with fire as it was wont to shine
<dt>From tossing torches round the dance aswarm.
<p>
<dt>Nor less, high-stationed on the gray grave heights,
<dt>High-thoughted seers with heaven's heart-kindling lights
<dt>Hold converse; and the herd of meaner things
<dt>Knows or by fiery scourge or fiery shaft
<dt>When wrath on thy broad brows has risen, and laughed,
<dt>Darkening thy soul with shadow of thunderous wings.
<p>
<a name=204></a><h2>Beaumont and Fletcher</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>An hour ere sudden sunset fired the west,
<dt>Arose two stars upon the pale deep east.
<dt>The hall of heaven was clear for night's high feast,
<dt>Yet was not yet day's fiery heart at rest.
<dt>Love leapt up from his mother's burning breast
<dt>To see those warm twin lights, as day decreased,
<dt>Wax wider, till when all the sun had ceased,
<dt>As suns they shone from evening's kindled crest.
<dt>Across them and between, a quickening fire,
<dt>Flamed Venus, laughing with appeased desire.
<dt>Their dawn, scarce lovelier for the gleam of tears,
<dt>Filled half the hollow shell 'twixt heaven and earth
<dt>With sound like moonlight, mingling moan and mirth,
<dt>Which rings and glitters down the darkling years.
<p>
<a name=204a></a><h2>John Ford</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Hew hard the marble from the mountain's heart
<dt>Where hardest night holds fast in iron gloom
<dt>Gems brighter than an April dawn in bloom,
<dt>That his Memnonian likeness thence may start
<dt>Revealed, whose hand with high funereal art
<dt>Carved night, and chiselled shadow: be the tomb
<dt>That speaks him famous graven with signs of doom
<dt>Intrenched inevitably in lines athwart,
<dt>As on some thunder-blasted Titan's brow
<dt>His record of rebellion. Not the day
<dt>Shall strike forth music from so stern a chord,
<dt>Touching this marble: darkness, none knows how,
<dt>And stars impenetrable of midnight, may
<dt>So looms the likeness of thy soul, John Ford.
<p>
<a name=204b></a><h2>John Webster</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thunder: the flesh quails, and the soul bows down.
<dt>Night: east, west, south, and northward, very night.
<dt>Star upon struggling star strives into sight,
<dt>Star after shuddering star the deep storms drown.
<dt>The very throne of night, her very crown,
<dt>A man lays hand on, and usurps her right.
<dt>Song from the highest of heaven's imperious height
<dt>Shoots, as a fire to smite some towering town.
<dt>Rage, anguish, harrowing fear, heart-crazing crime,
<dt>Make monstrous all the murderous face of Time
<dt>Shown in the spheral orbit of a glass
<dt>Revolving. Earth cries out from all her graves.
<dt>Frail, on frail rafts, across wide-wallowing waves,
<dt>Shapes here and there of child and mother pass.
<p>
<a name=219></a><h2>The Many</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Greene, garlanded with February's few flowers
<dt>Ere March came in with Marlowe's rapturous rage;
<dt>Peele, from whose hand the sweet white locks of age
<dt>Took the mild chaplet woven of honored hours;
<dt>Nash, laughing hard; Lodge, flushed from lyric bowers;
<dt>And Lilly, a goldfinch in a twisted cage
<dt>Fed by some gay great lady's pettish page
<dt>Till short sweet songs gush clear like short spring showers;
<dt>Kid, whose grim sport still gamboled over graves;
<dt>And Chettle, in whose fresh funereal verse
<dt>Weeps Marian yet on Robin's wildwood hearse;
<dt>Cooke, whose light boat of song one soft breath saves,
<dt>Sighed from a maiden's amorous mouth averse;
<dt>Live likewise ye--Time takes not you for slaves.
