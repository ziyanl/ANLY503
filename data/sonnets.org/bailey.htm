<p>
<dt>In a cot-studded, fruity, green deep dale,
<dt>There grows the ruin of an abbey old;
<dt>And on the hillside, cut in rock, behold
<dt>A sainted hermit's cell; so goes the tale.
<dt>What of that ruin? There is nothing left
<dt>Save one sky-framing window arch, which climbs
<dt>Up to its top point, single-stoned, bereft
<dt>Of prop or load.  And this strange thing sublimes
<dt>The scene. For the fair great house, vowed to God,
<dt>Is hurled down and unhallowed; and we tread
<dt>Over buried graves which have devoured their dead;
<dt>While over all springs up the green-lifed sod,
<dt>And arch, so light and ]ofty in its span--
<dt>So frail, and yet so lasting--'tis like man.</dt>
