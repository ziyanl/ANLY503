<p>
<dt>What curled and scented sun-girls, almond-eyed,
<dt>With lotus blossoms in their hands and hair,
<dt>Have made their swarthy lovers call them fair,
<dt>With these spent strings, when brutes were deified,
<dt>And Memnon in the sunrise sprang and cried,
<dt>And love-winds smote Bubastis, and the bare
<dt>Black breasts of carven Pasht received the prayer
<dt>Of suppliants bearing gifts from far and wide!
<dt>This lute has outsung Egypt; all the lives
<dt>Of violent passion, and the vast calm art
<dt>That lasts in granite only, all lie dead;
<dt>This little bird of song alone survives,
<dt>As fresh as when its fluting smote the heart
<dt>Last time the brown slave wore it garlanded.

<a name=020></a><h2>Alcyone</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>(A Sonnet in Dialogue)</h3>
<p>
<dt><i>Ph&oelig;bus.</i> What voice is this that wails above the deep?
<dt><i>Alcyone.</i> A wife's, that mourns her fate and loveless days.
<dt><i>Ph&oelig;bus.</i> What love lies buried in these waterways?
<dt><i>Alcyone.</i> A husband's, hurried to eternal sleep.
<dt><i>Ph&oelig;bus.</i> Cease, O beloved, cease to wail and weep!
<dt><i>Alcyone.</i> Wherefore?
<dt><i>Ph&oelig;bus.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waters in a fiery blaze
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proclaim the godhead of my healing rays.
<dt><i>Alcyone.</i> No god can sow where fate hath stood to reap.
<dt><i>Ph&oelig;bus.</i> Hold, wringing hands! cease, piteous tears, to fall.
<dt><i>Alcyone.</i> But grief must rain and glut the passionate sea.
<dt><i>Ph&oelig;bus.</i> Thou shall forget this ocean and thy wrong,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will bless the dead, though past recall.
<dt><i>Alcyone.</i> What can'st thou give to me or him in me?
<dt><i>Ph&oelig;bus.</i> A name in story and a light in song.

<a name=030></a><h2>The Tomb of Sophocles</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A bounding satyr, golden in the beard,
<dt>That leaps with goat-feet high into the air,
<dt>And crushes from the thyme an odour rare,
<dt>Keeps watch around the marble tomb revered
<dt>Of Sophocles, the poet loved and feared,
<dt>Whose mighty voice once called out of her lair
<dt>The Dorian muse severe, with braided hair,
<dt>Who loved the thyrsus and wild dances weird.
<dt>Here all day long the pious bees can pour
<dt>Libations of their honey; round this tomb
<dt>The Dionysiac ivy loves to roam;
<dt>The satyr laughs; but He awakes no more,
<dt>Wrapped up in silence at the grave's cold core,
<dt>Nor sees the sun wheel round in the white dome.
