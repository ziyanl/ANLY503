<p>
<dt>I had a dream all beautifully sad,
<dt>My life's sole solace had gone up on high,
<dt>And I was left on earth alone to die.
<dt>Musing in resignation almost glad,
<dt>I wept my loss, when lo, in beauty clad,
<dt>I saw my loved one to my couch draw nigh:
<dt>For she had descended from the sky,
<dt>If to my grief she might some respite add.
<dt>Sweet was the thought that love could bring her down,
<dt>But I was troubled as the mother, when
<dt>Her suff'ring infant wakes and moans again;
<dt>"O linger not--resume your heavenly crown,"
<dt>I said, and as soft notes of music fail,
<dt>She, smiling, melted in the moonbeams pale.
