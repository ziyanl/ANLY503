<h3><i>To Pierre Louys</i></h3>
<p>
<dt>Not pale, as one in sleep or holier death,
<dt>Nor illcontent the lady seems, nor loth
<dt>To lie in shadow of shrill river growth,
<dt>So steadfast are the river's arms beneath.
<p>
<dt>Pale petals follow her in very faith,
<dt>Unmixed with pleasure or regret, and both
<dt>Her maidly hands look up, in noble sloth
<dt>To take the blossoms of her scattered wreath.
<p>
<dt>No weakest ripple lives to kiss her throat,
<dt>Nor dies in meshes of untangled hair;
<dt>No movement stirs the floor of river moss.
<p>
<dt>Until some furtive glimmer gleam across
<dt>Voluptuous mouth, where even teeth are bare,
<dt>And gild the broidery of her petticoat...
<p>

<p>
<dt>Geranium, houseleek, laid in oblong beds
<dt>On the trim grass. The daisies' leprous stain
<dt>Is fresh. Each night the daisies burst again,
<dt>Though every day the gardener crops their heads.
<p>
<dt>A wistful child, in foul unwholesome shreds,
<dt>Recalls some legend of a daisy chain
<dt>That makes a pretty necklace. She would fain
<dt>Make one, and wear it, if she had some threads.
<p>
<dt>Sun, leprous flowers, foul child. The asphalt burns.
<dt>The garrulous sparrows perch on metal Burns.
<dt>Sing! Sing! they say, and flutter with their wings.
<dt>He does not sing, he only wonders why
<dt>He is sitting there. The sparrows sing. And I
<dt>Yield to the strait allure of simple things.

<p>
<dt>Conquered the flower-maidens, and the wide embrace
<dt>Of their round proffered arms, that tempt the virgin boy;
<dt>Conquered the trickling of their babbling tongues; the coy
<dt>Back glances, and the mobile breasts of subtle grace;
<p>
<dt>Conquered the Woman Beautiful, the fatal charm
<dt>Of her hot breast, the music of her babbling tongue;
<dt>Conquered the gate of Hell, into the gate the young
<dt>Man passes, with the heavy trophy at his arm,
<p>
<dt>The holy Javelin that pierced the Heart of God.
<dt>He heals the dying king, he sits upon the throne,
<dt>King, and high priest of that great gift, the living Blood.
<p>
<dt>In robe of gold the youth adores the glorious Sign
<dt>Of the green goblet, worships the mysterious Wine.
<dt>And oh! the chime of children's voices in the dome.
