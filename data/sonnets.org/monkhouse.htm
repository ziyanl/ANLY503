<dt>From morn to eve they struggled--Life and Death.
<dt>At first it seemed to me that they in mirth
<dt>Contended, and as foes of equal worth,
<dt>So firm their feet, so undisturbed their breath.
<dt>But when the sharp red sun cut through its sheath
<dt>Of western clouds, I saw the brown arms' girth
<dt>Tighten and bear that radiant form to earth,
<dt>And suddenly both fell upon the heath.
<dt>And then the wonder came--for when I fled
<dt>To where those great antagonists down fell
<dt>I could not find the body that I sought,
<dt>And when and where it went I could not tell,
<dt>One only form was left of those who fought,
<dt>The long dark form of Death--and it was dead.
