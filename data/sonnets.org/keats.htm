<a name=010></a><h2>On the Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>If by dull rhymes our English must be chained,
<dt>And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet
<dt>Fettered, in spite of pain&eacute;d loveliness;
<dt>Let us find out, if we must be constrained,
<dt>Sandals more interwoven and complete
<dt>To fit the naked foot of poesy;
<dt>Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress
<dt>Of every chord, and see what may be gained
<dt>By ear industrious, and attention meet;
<dt>Misers of sound and syllable, no less
<dt>Than Midas of his coinage, let us be
<dt>Jealous of dead leaves in the bay-wreath crown;
<dt>So, if we may not let the Muse be free,
<dt>She will be bound with garlands of her own.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>On First Looking into Chapman's Homer</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
<dt>And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
<dt>Round many western islands have I been
<dt>Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
<dt>Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
<dt>That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;
<dt>Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
<dt>Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
<dt>Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
<dt>When a new planet swims into his ken;
<dt>Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
<dt>He star'd at the Pacific--and all his men
<dt>Look'd at each other with a wild surmise
<dt>Silent, upon a peak in Darien.
</P>
<a name=150></a><h2>On the Grasshopper and Cricket</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>The poetry of earth is never dead:
<dt>When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
<dt>And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
<dt>From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;
<dt>That is the Grasshopper's--he takes the lead
<dt>In summer luxury,--he has never done
<dt>With his delights; for when tired out with fun
<dt>He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
<dt>The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
<dt>On a lone winter evening, when the frost
<dt>Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills
<dt>The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,
<dt>And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,
<dt>The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.
</P>

<a name=200></a><h2>On Sitting down to Read King Lear Once Again</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>O golden tongued Romance, with serene lute!
<dt>Fair plumed Syren, Queen of far-away!
<dt>Leave melodizing on this wintry day,
<dt>Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute:
<dt>Adieu! for, once again, the fierce dispute
<dt>Betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay
<dt>Must I burn through; once more humbly assay
<dt>The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit:
<dt>Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion,
<dt>Begetters of our deep eternal theme!
<dt>When through the old oak Forest I am gone,
<dt>Let me not wander in a barren dream,
<dt>But, when I am consumed in the fire,
<dt>Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire.
</P>
<a name=300></a><h2>On Seeing the Elgin Marbles</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>My spirit is too weak--mortality
<dt>Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
<dt>And each imagin'd pinnacle and steep
<dt>Of godlike hardship, tells me I must die
<dt>Like a sick Eagle looking at the sky.
<dt>Yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep
<dt>That I have not the cloudy winds to keep,
<dt>Fresh for the opening of the morning's eye.
<dt>Such dim-conceived glories of the brain
<dt>Bring round the heart an undescribable feud;
<dt>So do these wonders a most dizzy pain,
<dt>That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude
<dt>Wasting of old Time--with a billowy main--
<dt>A sun--a shadow of a magnitude.
</P>
<a name=400></a><h2>"Why did I laugh to-night? No voice will tell"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Why did I laugh tonight? No voice will tell.
<dt>No God, no Demon of severe response,
<dt>Deigns to reply from Heaven or from Hell.
<dt>Then to my human heart I turn at once.
<dt>Heart! Thou and I are here sad and alone;
<dt>I say, why did I laugh! 0 mortal pain!
<dt>O Darkness! Darkness! ever must I moan,
<dt>To question Heaven and Hell and Heart in vain.
<dt>Why did I laugh? I know this Being's lease,
<dt>My fancy to its utmost blisses spreads;
<dt>Yet would I on this very midnight cease,
<dt>And the world's gaudy ensigns see in shreds;
<dt>Verse, Fame, and Beauty are intense indeed,
<dt>But Death intenser--Death is Life's high meed.
</P>
<a name=500></a><h2>When I Have Fears</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>When I have fears that I may cease to be
<dt>Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,
<dt>Before high-piled books, in charactery,
<dt>Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain;
<dt>When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,
<dt>Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
<dt>And think that I may never live to trace
<dt>Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;
<dt>And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
<dt>That I shall never look upon thee more,
<dt>Never have relish in the faery power
<dt>Of unreflecting love;--then on the shore
<dt>Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
<dt>Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.
</P>

<a name=600></a><h2>Bright Star</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art--
<dt>Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
<dt>And watching, with eternal lids apart,
<dt>Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,
<dt>The moving waters at their priestlike task
<dt>Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
<dt>Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
<dt>Of snow upon the mountains and the moors
<dt>No--yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,
<dt>Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,
<dt>To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
<dt>Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
<dt>Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
<dt>And so live ever-or else swoon to death.
</P>
