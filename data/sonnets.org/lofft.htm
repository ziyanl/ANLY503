<a name=010></a><h2>The Sports of the Field</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sports of the field!--deadly or maiming blow
<dt>Aimed at a gentle bird!--the timid hare
<dt>From her half slumber in warm brake to scare
<dt>And drive her over the track-betraying snow
<dt>To death, by chase embittered--from the bow
<dt>The rook, not yet of strength to cleave the air,
<dt>To slaughter trembling on the nest!--to tear
<dt>The bowels of the fish deliberate, slow,
<p>
<dt>Play with the agonizing worm!--to find
<dt>Amusement when the dauntless fox is torn
<dt>By furious dogs--or when the beauteous hind,
<dt>Winged by her unavailing fears, is borne
<dt>From yells of hounds and horn--or the stag dies
<dt>With silent tear!--Thus man enjoys earth, water, skies!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Absence</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I love: and day by day, as absent, pine
<dt>Barr'd from her sight and converse whom I love:
<dt>And yet the fair by plighted vows is mine;
<dt>Mine by affection far those vows above
<dt>Mine by possession;--O the bliss divine;--
<dt>Nor can my heart her constancy reprove.
<dt>Why does she then society decline
<dt>With me, me whose desires never from her remove?
<p>
<dt>O night, return and give her to my arms!
<dt>Full of constraint and tedious is the day.
<dt>Though the same roof enshrine her wedded charms
<dt>Though on my board beam her benignant ray.--
<dt>O, haste the hour when private and alone
<dt>Joys only she can give shall be my own!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Ring</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Dear, mystic circlet!.... orbs like thine are found
<dt>Within their hallowd empire to enclose
<dt>Such unimagin'd joys, such cares and woes,
<dt>As still in hearts most sensible abound.
<dt>O, since for me bliss animates thy mound
<dt>Few be thy cares to her:--and only those
<dt>Whence sympathy more sweet and tender flows
<dt>And anguish with increas'd delight is crown'd.
<p>
<dt>Dear circlet!--while with love and awe I gaze
<dt>On thy pure gold, of constancy the sign,
<dt>Ah, prompt, if once imagination strays,
<dt>Recall my wedded thoughts to their blest shrine:
<dt>Nor look unkind, nor passion's angry sound,
<dt>E'er touch her gentle heart who bears from me thy round!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Love's Likeness</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>"Just like love the balmy rose:"
<dt>For ah their sweets have many a thorn;
<dt>And tempests chase their early morn;
<dt>Serenely calm each rarely glows.
<dt>But when enchanting music flows
<dt>Then pure and full delight is born,
<dt>And anxious care and woe forlorn
<dt>Are lull'd into divine repose!--
<p>
<dt>Just like love blest music breathes:
<dt>But with her bliss no pang enwreaths.--
<dt>Like love, ere death, or fear, or pain
<dt>Invaded those prim&aelig;val bowers
<dt>Where the first parents hail'd the reign
<dt>Of harmony mid angel-powers.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>To the Sea: Written on the Beach at Aldborough</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou awful sea!--upon this shingly beach
<dt>Of Aldborough I pace:--my gazing eye
<dt>Thy world of waters lost in the dim sky
<dt>Admiring, and thy echoing waves, that teach,
<dt>In voice of thunder, more than tongue can preach;
<dt>The knell of ages past and passing by;
<dt>And claim their ancient Empire o'er the dry
<dt>And solid Earth; each animating each.
<p>
<dt>Of towns long sunk, o'er which thy wild waves roar,
<dt>Of sea to land, of land to ocean turn'd,
<dt>I muse: and mourn, that who could amplest pour
<dt>Homeric tones on thy resounding shore
<dt>Porson is dead!--That sea of Grecian lore
<dt>Unbounded, in the abyss of fate inurn'd.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>The Musical Analogies of the Universe: On Occasion of the Comet of 1811</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Nature is Music;--and the mystic tale,
<dt>No fable to the well-attempered ear,
<dt>Which sings that harmony tunes every sphere
<dt>In perfect concert:--though to mortals frail
<dt>Too fine the spirit of the ethereal gale
<dt>To reach this seat of earthly hope and fear;
<dt>When immortality removes the veil
<dt>Then we shall see indeed and truly hear.
<p>
<dt>Thou wondrous visitant! who hast so late
<dt>Approacht the sun, and now returning bright
<dt>In radiant glory from that source of light,
<dt>In diapason voicest forth Heaven's state,
<dt>A chord thou art of that celestial lyre,
<dt>To which through countless worlds resounds the angelic choir!
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>To Coleridge</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou who hast amply quaff'd the Muse's rill,
<dt>And bath'd thy locks in pure poetic dews,
<dt>Canst thou disparage the Petrarcan Muse;
<dt>To her sweet voice deaf, cold, fastidious still!
<dt>Examine if unprejudic'd the will,
<dt>Coleridge, which can to her high praise refuse;
<dt>And of perverseness her fair laws accuse
<dt>Which through the enchanted ear the bosom fill.
<p>
<dt>Her various, cadenc'd, regularity
<dt>He who o'er epic heights hath soar'd sublime,
<dt>And magic Spenser, lov'd. The mighty dead
<dt>Have followers, haply to posterity
<dt>Not unendear'd.--O scorn not these, who led
<dt>In many a graceful maze the full harmonious rhyme.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>That the True Structure of the Sonnet Should Be Observ'd by Authors of Genius Who Thus Entitle Their Poems</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dd>[addressed to <a href="white.htm">Henry Kirke White</a>]
<p>
<dt>Ye, whose aspirings court the Muse of lays
<dt>"Severest of those orders which belong
<dt>Distinct and separate to Delphic song"
<dt>Why shun the sonnet's undulating maze?
<dt>Or why its name, boast of Petrarcan days,
<dt>Assume, its rules disown'd?--whom from the throng
<dt>The Muse selects, their ear the charm obeys
<dt>Of its full harmony:--they fear to wrong
<p>
<dt>The sonnet by adorning with a name
<dt>Of that distinguisht import, lays, though sweet,
<dt>Yet not in magic texture taught to meet
<dt>Of that so varied and peculiar frame.
<dt>O think, to vindicate its genuine praise
<dt>Those it becomes whose lyre a favoring impulse sways.
