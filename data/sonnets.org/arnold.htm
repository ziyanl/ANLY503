<dt>Others abide our question. Thou art free.
<dt>We ask and ask: Thou smilest and art still,
<dt>Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill
<dt>That to the stars uncrowns his majesty,
<dt>Planting his stedfast footsteps in the sea,
<dt>Making the Heaven of Heavens his dwelling-place,
<dt>Spares but the cloudy border of his base
<dt>To the foil'd searching of mortality:
<dt>And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,
<dt>Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure,
<dt>Didst walk on Earth unguess'd at. Better so!
<dt>All pains the immortal spirit must endure,
<dt>All weakness that impairs, all griefs that bow,
<dt>Find their sole voice in that victorious brow. 
<p></p>

<dt>Crouch'd on the pavement close by Belgrave Square
<dt>A tramp I saw, ill, moody, and tongue-tied;
<dt>A babe was in her arms, and at her side
<dt>A girl; their clothes were rags, their feet were bare.
<dt>Some labouring men, whose work lay somewhere there,
<dt>Pass'd opposite; she touch'd her girl, who hied
<dt>Across, and begg'd and came back satisfied.
<dt>The rich she had let pass with frozen stare.
<dt>Thought I: Above her state this spirit towers;
<dt>She will not ask of aliens, but of friends,
<dt>Of sharers in a common human fate.
<dt>She turns from that cold succour, which attends
<dt>The unknown little from the unknowing great,
<dt>And points us to a better time than ours.

<dt>'Twas August, and the fierce sun overhead
<dt>Smote on the squalid streets of Bethnal Green,
<dt>And the pale weaver through his windows seen
<dt>In Spitalfields, looking thrice dispirited;
<dt>I met a preacher there I knew, and said:
<dt>"Ill and o'erworked, how fare you in this scene?"
<dt>"Bravely," said he; "for I of late have been
<dt>Much cheered with thoughts of Christ, <i>the living bread.</i>"
<dt>O human soul! as long as thou canst so
<dt>Set up a mark of everlasting light,
<dt>Above the howling senses' ebb and flow,
<dt>To cheer thee and to right thee if thou roam,
<dt>Not with lost toil thou labourest through the night!
<dt>Thou mak'st the heaven thou hop'st indeed thy home.
<p>
<a name="250"></a><h2>Immortality</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Foil'd by our fellow men, depress'd, outworn,
<dt>We leave the brutal world to take its way,
<dt>And, <i>Patience! in another life</i>, we say,
<dt><i>The world shall be thrust down, and we up-borne!</i>
<p></p>
<dt>And will not, then the immortal armies scorn
<dt>The world's poor routed leavings? or will they,
<dt>Who fail'd under the heat of this life's day,
<dt>Support the fervours of the heavenly morn?
<p></p>
<dt>No, no! the energy of life may be
<dt>Kept on after the grave, but not begun!
<dt>And he who flagg'd not in the earthly strife,
<p></p>
<dt>From strength to strength advancing--only he,
<dt>His soul well-knit, and all his battles won,
<dt>Mounts, and that hardly, to eternal life.

<dt>God knows it, I am with you.  If to prize
<dt>Those virtues, priz'd and practis'd by too few,
<dt>But priz'd, but lov'd, but eminent in you,
<dt>Man's fundamental life: if to despise
<dt>The barren optimistic sophistries
<dt>Of comfortable moles, whom what they do
<dt>Teaches the limit of the just and true--
<dt>And for such doing have no need of eyes:
<dt>If sadness at the long heart-wasting show
<dt>Wherein earth's great ones are disquieted:
<dt>If thoughts, not idle, while before me flow
<dt>The armies of the homeless and unfed:--
<dt>If these are yours, if this is what you are,
<dt>Then am I yours, and what you feel, I share.</dt>
