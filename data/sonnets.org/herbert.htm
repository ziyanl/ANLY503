<p>George Herbert was greatly influenced by the work of <a href="donne.htm">John Donne</a>, a friend of the Herbert family. In a brief study of George Herbert, <a href="bibliogr.htm#eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> instructively compares two sonnets--<a href="#100">Prayer</a> by Herbert and <a href="donne.htm#114">Holy Sonnet 14</a> by Donne.  Eliot finds in Donne more of the "orator," a contrast to the more intimate tone of Herbert, a contrast that may reflect the size of Donne's large congregation at St. Paul's Cross versus Herbert's small rural parish in Wiltshire.

<a name=001></a><h2><a href="#999">A Sonnet</a></h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My God, where is that ancient heat towards thee,
<dt>Wherewith whole shoals of martyrs once did burn,
<dt>Besides their other flames?  Doth poetry
<dt>Wear Venus' livery?  only serve her turn?
<dt>Why are not sonnets made of thee?  and lays
<dt>Upon thine altar burnt?  Cannot thy love
<dt>Heighten a spirit to sound out thy praise
<dt>As well as any she?  Cannot thy Dove
<dt>Outstrip their Cupid easily in flight?
<dt>Or, since thy ways are deep, and still the fame,
<dt>Will not a verse run smooth that bears thy name!
<dt>Why doth that fire, which by thy power and might
<dt>Each breast does feel, no braver fuel choose
<dt>Than that, which one day, worms may chance refuse.
<p>
<dt>Sure Lord, there is enough in thee to dry
<dt>Oceans of ink; for, as the Deluge did
<dt>Cover the earth, so doth thy Majesty:
<dt>Each cloud distills thy praise, and doth forbid
<dt>Poets to turn it to another use.
<dt>Roses and lilies speak thee; and to make
<dt>A pair of cheeks of them, is thy abuse
<dt>Why should I women's eyes for crystal take?
<dt>Such poor invention burns in their low mind
<dt>Whose fire is wild, and doth not upward go
<dt>To praise, and on thee, Lord, some ink bestow.
<dt>Open the bones, and you shall nothing find
<dt>In the best face but filth; when Lord, in thee
<dt>The beauty lies in the discovery.
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>Holy Baptism</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As he that sees a dark and shady grove,
<dt>Stays not, but looks beyond it on the sky
<dt>So when I view my sins, mine eyes remove
<dt>More backward still, and to that water fly,
<dt>Which is above the heav'ns, whose spring and rent
<dt>Is in my dear Redeemer's pierced side.
<dt>O blessed streams!  either ye do prevent
<dt>And stop our sins from growing thick and wide,
<p>
<dt>Or else give tears to drown them, as they grow.
<dt>In you Redemption measures all my time,
<dt>And spreads the plaster equal to the crime:
<dt>You taught the book of life my name, that so,
<p>
<dt>Whatever future sins should me miscall,
<dt>Your first acquaintance might discredit all.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>Prayer</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Prayer, the Church's banquet, Angels' age,
<dt>God's breath in man returning to his birth,
<dt>The soul in paraphrase, heart in pilgrimage,
<dt>The Christian plummet sounding heav'n and earth;
<dt>Engine against th' Almighty, sinner's tower,
<dt>Reversed thunder, Christ-side-piercing spear,
<dt>The six-days'-world transposing in an hour,
<dt>A kind of tune, which all things hear and fear;
<dt>Softness, and peace, and joy, and love, and bliss,
<dt>Exalted manna, gladness of the best,
<dt>Heaven in ordinary, man well dressed,
<dt>The milky way, the bird of Paradise,
<dt>Church bells beyond the stars heard, the soul's blood,
<dt>The land of spices, something understood.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Oh Book!  infinite sweetness!  let my heart
<dt>Suck ev'ry letter, and a honey gain,
<dt>Precious for any grief in any part;
<dt>To clear the breast, to mollify all pain.
<p>
<dt>Thou art all health, health thriving, till it make
<dt>A full eternity:  thou art a mass
<dt>Of strange delights, where we may wish and take.
<dt>Ladies, look here; this is the thankful glass,
<p>
<dt>That mends the looker's eyes:  this is the well
<dt>That washes what it shows.  Who can <a href="#999">endear</a>
<dt>Thy praise too much? thou art heav'n's <a href="#999">Lidger</a> here,
<dt>Working against the states of death and hell.
<p>
<dt>Thou art joy's <a href="#999">handsel</a>: heav'n lies flat in thee,
<dt>Subject to ev'ry mounter's bended knee.

<p>
<dt>Oh that I knew how all thy lights combine,
<dt>And the configurations of their glory!
<dt>Seeing not only how each verse doth shine,
<dt>But all the constellations of the story.
<p>
<dt>This verse marks that, and both do make a motion
<dt>Unto a third, that ten leaves off doth lie:
<dt>Then as dispersed herbs do <a href="#999">match</a> a potion,
<dt>These three make up some Christians' destiny.
<p>
<dt>Such are thy secrets, which my life makes good,
<dt>And comments on thee:  for in ev'ry thing
<dt>Thy words do find me out, and parallels bring,
<dt>And in another make me understood.
<p>
<dt>Stars are poor books, and oftentimes do miss
<dt>This book of stars lights to eternal bliss.

<a name=120></a><h2>Sin</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lord, with what care hast thou begirt us round!
<dt>Parents first season us: then schoolmasters
<dt>Deliver us to laws; they send us bound
<dt>To rules of reason, holy messengers,
<p>
<dt>Pulpits and Sundays, sorrow dogging sin,
<dt>Afflictions sorted, anguish of all sizes,
<dt>Fine nets and stratagems to catch us in
<dt>Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,
<p>
<dt>Blessings beforehand, ties of gratefulness,
<dt>The sound of glory ringing in our ears;
<dt>Without, our shame; within, our consciences;
<dt>Angels and grace, eternal hopes and fears.
<p>
<dt>Yet all these fences and their whole array
<dt>One cunning bosom-sin blows quite away.
<p>
<a name=150></a><h2>The Sinner</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lord, how I am all ague, when I seek
<dt>What I have treasured in my memory!
<dt>Since, if my soul make even with the week,
<dt>Each seventh note by right is due to thee.
<dt>I find there quarries of piled vanities,
<dt>But shreds of holiness, that dare not venture
<dt>To shew their face, since cross to thy decrees:
<dt>There the circumference earth is, heav'n the center.
<dt>In so much dregs the quintessence is small:
<dt>The spirit and good extract of my heart
<dt>Comes to about the many hundredth part.
<dt>Yet, Lord, restore thine image, hear my call:
<dt>And though my hard heart scarce to thee can groan,
<dt>Remember that thou once didst write in stone.
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>Redemption</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Having been tenant long to a rich Lord,
<dt>Not thriving, I resolved to be bold,
<dt>And make a suit unto Him, to afford
<dt>A new small-rented lease, and cancel th' old.
<dt>In heaven at His manor I Him sought:
<dt>They told me there, that He was lately gone
<dt>About some land, which He had dearly bought
<dt>Long since on Earth, to take possession.
<dt>I straight returned, and knowing His great birth,
<dt>Sought Him accordingly in great resorts--
<dt>In cities, theatres, gardens, parks, and courts:
<dt>At length I heard a ragged noise and mirth
<dt>Of thieves and murderers; there I Him espied,
<dt>Who straight, "Your suit is granted," said, and died.
<p>
<a name=250></a><h2>Joseph's Coat</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Wounded I sing, tormented I indite,
<dt>Thrown down I fall into a bed, and rest:
<dt>Sorrow hath chang'd its note:  such is his will
<dt>Who changeth all things, as him pleaseth best.
<dt>For well he knows, if but one grief and smart
<dt>Among my many had his full career,
<dt>Sure it would carry with it ev'n my heart,
<dt>And both would run until they found a bier
<dt>To fetch the body; both being due to grief.
<dt>But he hath spoil'd the race; and giv'n to anguish
<dt>One of Joy's coats, 'ticing it with relief
<dt>To linger in me, and together languish.
<dt>I live to shew his power, who once did bring
<dt>My joys to weep, and now my griefs to sing.
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>The Son</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Let foreign nations of their language boast,
<dt>What fine variety each tongue affords:
<dt>I like our language, as our men and coast;
<dt>Who cannot dress it well, want with, not words.
<dt>How neatly do we give one only name
<dt>To parents' issue and the sun's bright star.
<dt>A son is light and fruit; a fruitful flame
<dt>Chafing the father's dimness, carried far
<dt>From the first man in th' East, to fresh and new
<dt>Western discov'ries of posterity.
<dt>So in one word our Lord's humility
<dt>We turn upon him in a sense most true;
<dt>For what Christ once in humbleness began,
<dt>We him in glory call, The Son of Man.
<p>
<a name=350></a><h2>Christmas</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>All after pleasures as I rid one day,
<dt>My horse and I, both tir'd, body and mind,
<dt>With full cry of affections, quite astray;
<dt>I took up in the next inn I could find.
<p>
<dt>There when I came, whom found I but my dear,
<dt>My dearest Lord, expecting till the grief
<dt>Of pleasures brought me to Him, ready there
<dt>To be all passengers' most sweet relief?
<p>
<dt>O Thou, whose glorious, yet contracted light,
<dt>Wrapt in night's mantle, stole into a manger,
<dt>Since my dark sould and brutish is Thy right,
<dt>To Man of all beasts be not thou a stranger:
<p>
<dt>Furnish and deck my soul, that thou mayst have
<dt>A better lodging than a rack or grave.
<p>
<a name=400></a><h2>The Answer</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My comforts drop and melt like snow:
<dt>I shake my head, and all the thoughts and ends,
<dt>Which my fierce youth did bandy, fall and flow
<dt>Like leaves about me, or like summer-friends
<dt>Flies of estates and sun-shine. But to all,
<dt>Who think me eager, hot, and undertaking,
<dt>But in my prosecutions slack and small;
<dt>As a young exhalation, newly waking,
<dt>Scorns his first bed of dirt, and means the sky;
<dt>But cooling by the way, grows <a href="#999">pursy</a> and slow,
<dt>And settling to a cloud, doth live and die
<dt>In that dark state of tears: to all, that so
<dt>Show me, and set me, I have one reply,
<dt>Which they that know the rest, know more than I.
