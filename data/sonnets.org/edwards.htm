<p>
<dt>In evil hour did Pope's declining age,
<dt>Deceived and dazzled by the tinsel show
<dt>Of wordy science and the nauseous flow
<dt>Of mean, officious flatteries, engage
<dt>Thy venal quill to deck his laboured page
<dt>With ribald nonsense, and permit to strew
<dt>Amidst his flowers, the baleful weeds that grow
<dt>In the unblessed soil of rude and rancorous rage.
<p>
<dt>Yet this the avenging muse ordain&eacute;d so,
<dt>When, by his counsel or weak sufferance,
<dt>To thee were trusted Shakespeare's fame and fate:
<dt>She doomed him down the stream of time to tow
<dt>Thy foul, dirt-loaded hulk, or sink perchance,
<dt>Dragged to oblivion by the foundering weight.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>To the Editor of Mr. Pope's Works</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O born in luckless hour, with every muse
<dt>And every grace to foe! what wayward fate
<dt>Drives thee with fell and unrelenting hate
<dt>Each choicest work of genius to abuse?
<dt>Sufficed it not with sacrilegious views
<dt>Great Shakespeare's awful shade to violate:
<dt>And <i>his</i> fair Paradise contaminate,
<dt>Whom impious Lauder blushes to accuse?
<p>
<dt>Must Pope, thy friend, mistaken, hapless bard!
<dt>(To prove no sprig of laurel ever can grow
<dt>Unblasted by thy venom) must he groan
<dt>Now daubed with flattery, now by censure scarred,
<dt>Disguised, deformed, and made the public show
<dt>In motley weeds and colours not his own?
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>To the Author of "Clarissa"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O master of the heart, whose magic skill
<dt>The close recesses of the soul can find,
<dt>Can rouse, becalm, and terrify the mind,
<dt>Now melt with pity, now with anguish thrill,
<dt>Thy moral page while virtuous precepts fill,
<dt>Warm from the heart, to mend the age designed,
<dt>Wit, strength, truth, decency all conjoined
<dt>To lead our youth to good, and guard from ill:
<p>
<dt>O long enjoy what thou so well hast won--
<dt>The grateful tribute of each honest heart
<dt>Sincere, nor hackneyed in the ways of men;
<dt>At each distressful stroke their true tears run,
<dt>And nature, unsophisticate by art,
<dt>Owns and applauds the labours of thy pen.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>To His Grace Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Prelate, whose steady hand and watchful eye
<dt>The sacred vessel of religion guide,
<dt>Secure from superstition's dangerous tide
<dt>And fateful rocks of infidelity;
<dt>Think not, in this bad age of obloquy,
<dt>When Christian virtues Christians dare deride
<dt>And worth by party zeal alone is tried,
<dt>To escape the poisoned shafts of calumny;
<p>
<dt>No--though the tenor of thy blameless life,
<dt>Like His whose flock is to thy care consigned,
<dt>Be spent in teaching truth and doing good,
<dt>Yet, amongst the sons of bigotry and strife
<dt>Thou too, like Him, must hear thy good maligned,
<dt>Thy person slandered, and thy truths withstood.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Capricious wray a sonnet needs must have;
<dt>I ne'er was so put to 't before--a sonnet!
<dt>Why, fourteen verses must be spent upon it:
<dt>"Tis good, howe'er, t' have conquered the first stave.
<p>
<dt>Yet I shall ne'er find rhymes enough by half,"
<dt>Said I, and found myself i' the midst o' the second.
<dt>If twice four verses were but fairly reckoned,
<dt>I shall turn back on th' hardest part and laugh.
<p>
<dt>Thus far, with good success I think I've scribbled,
<dt>And of the twice seven lines have clean got o'er ten,
<dt>Courage! another'll finish the first triplet.
<dt>Thanks to thee, muse, my work begins to shorten.
<p>
<dt>There's thirteen lines got through, driblet by driblet,
<dt>'Tis done! count how you will, I warr'nt there's fourteen.
