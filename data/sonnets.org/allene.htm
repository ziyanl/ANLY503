<p>
<dt>Strange Truth and Beauty are enemies,
<dt>Treading forever on each other's toes!
<dt>Strange rhymes are always made of that which is
<dt>Too false or silly to be said in prose!
<dt>Now here's a sonnet by our village poet
<dt>"Inscribed to Kate," in most romantic style,
<dt>Whereas,--and one with half an eye might know it,--
<dt>He means Sophronia Tompkins, all the while.
<dt>He sings of "golden curls." If fiery tresses
<dt>Had heat to match their hue, <i>her</i> hair would burn;--
<dt>He mentions "airy grace,"--while she possesses
<dt>A form as shapeless as an old-time churn,
<dt>Heavens! after this I never shall inquire
<dt><i>Why people always call the poet's song a</i> LYRE!
