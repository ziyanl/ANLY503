<p>"A native of New York city, he was a student in Lynn, 
Mass., a clerk in Boston, and, following his literary bent, an author and public 
reader.&nbsp; His life is the pathetic and too familiar story of suffering and 
unfulfilled promise.&nbsp; He published a volume of poems, In the King's Garden.

<h2>A Portrait</h2>
<p>
<dt>In the white sweetness of her dimpled chin
<dt>The pink points of her perfumed fingers press,
<dt>And 'round her tremulous mouth's loveliness
<dt>The tears and smiles a sudden strife begin:
<dt>First one and then the other seems to win:
<dt>And o'er her drooping eyes a golden tress
<dt>Falls down to hide what else they might confess
<dt>Their blue-veined lids are striving to shut in.
<dt>The yellow pearls that bind her throat about
<dt>With her pale bosom's throbbing rise or fall:
<dt>The while her thoughts like carrier-doves have fled
<dt>To that far land where armies clash and shout,
<dt>And where, beyond love's reach, a soldier tall
<dt>With staring eyes and broken sword lies dead.
