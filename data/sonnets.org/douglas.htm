<p>Lord Alfred Douglas was born in 1870 and educated at Magdalen College, Oxford. He was the editor of <i>The Academy</i> from 1907 to 1910 and was at one time the intimate friend of <a href="wilde.htm">Oscar Wilde</a>. One of the minor poets of "the eighteen-nineties," several of his poems rise above his own affectations and the end-of-the-century decadence. The City of the Soul (1899) and Sonnets (1900) contain his most graceful writing.

<p>
<dt>I dreamed of him last night, I saw his face
<dt>All radiant and unshadowed of distress,
<dt>And as of old, in music measureless,
<dt>I heard his golden voice and marked him trace
<dt>Under the common thing the hidden grace,
<dt>And conjure wonder out of emptiness,
<dt>Till mean things put on beauty like a dress
<dt>And all the world was an enchanted place.
<p>
<dt>And then methought outside a fast locked gate
<dt>I mourned the loss of unrecorded words,
<dt>Forgotten tales and mysteries half said,
<dt>Wonders that might have been articulate,
<dt>And voiceless thoughts like murdered singing birds.
<dt>And so I woke and knew that he was dead.
<p>(Compare Keats's sonnet <a href="keats.htm#500">When I Have Fears</a>.)

<h3><i>Sonnet, dedicated to those French men of letters (Messrs. Zola, Copee, Sardou and others) who refused to compromise their spotless reputations or imperil their literary exclusiveness by signing a merciful petition in favour of Oscar Wilde.</i></h3>
<p>
<dt>Not all the singers of a thousand years
<dt>Can open English prisons. No. Though hell
<dt>Opened for Tracian Orpheus, now the spell
<dt>Of song and art is powerless as the tears
<dt>That love has shed. You that were full of fears,
<dt>And mean self-love, shall live to know full well
<dt>That you yourselves, not he, were pitiable
<dt>When you met mercy's voice with frowns or jeers.
<p>
<dt>And did you ask who signed the plea with you?
<dt>Fools! It was signed already with the sign
<dt>Of great dead men, of God-like Socrates,
<dt>Shakespeare and Plato and the Florentine
<dt>Who conquered form. And all your pretty crew
<dt>Once, and once only, might have stood with these.

<h3>London</h3>
<p>
<dt>See what a mass of gems the city wears
<dt>Upon her broad live bosom! row on row
<dt>Rubies and emeralds and amethysts glow.
<dt>See! that huge circle like a necklace, stares
<dt>With thousands of bold eyes to heaven, and dares
<dt>The golden stars to dim the lamps below,
<dt>And in the mirror of the mire I know
<dt>The moon has left her image unawares.
<p>
<dt>That's the great town at night: I see her breasts,
<dt>Pricked out with lamps they stand like huge black towers.
<dt>I think they move! I hear her panting breath.
<dt>And that's her head where the tiara rests.
<dt>And in her brain, through lanes as dark as death,
<dt> Men creep like thoughts...The lamps are like pale flowers.

<p>
<dt>What shall we do, my soul, to please the King?
<dt>Seeing he hath no pleasure in the dance,
<dt>And hath condemned the honeyed utterance
<dt>Of silver flutes and mouths made round to sing.
<dt>Along the wall red roses climb and cling,
<dt>And oh! my prince, lift up thy countenance,
<dt>For there be thoughts like roses that entrance
<dt>More than the languors of soft lute-playing.
<p>
<dt>Think how the hidden things that poets see
<dt>In amber eves or mornings crystalline,
<dt>Hide in the soul their constant quenchless light,
<dt>Till, called by some celestial alchemy,
<dt>Out of forgotten depths, they rise and shine
<dt>Like buried treasure on Midsummer night.

<p>
<dt>To see the moment holds a madrigal,
<dt>To find some cloistered place, some hermitage
<dt>For free devices, some deliberate cage
<dt>Wherein to keep wild thoughts like birds in thrall;
<dt>To eat sweet honey and to taste black gall,
<dt>To fight with form, to wrestle and to rage,
<dt>Till at the last upon the conquered page
<dt>The shadows of created Beauty fall.
<p>
<dt>This is the sonnet, this is all delight
<dt>Of every flower that blows in every Spring,
<dt>And all desire of every desert place;
<dt>This is the joy that fills a cloudy night
<dt>When bursting from her misty following,
<dt>A perfect moon wins to an empty space.
<p>
<a name=060></a><H2>The Green River</H2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I know a green grass path that leaves the field,
<dt>And like a running river, winds along
<dt>Into a leafy wood where is no throng
<dt>Of birds at noon-day, and no soft throats yield
<dt>Their music to the moon. The place is sealed,
<dt>An unclaimed sovereignty of voiceless song,
<dt>And all the unravished silences belong
<dt>To some sweet singer lost or unrevealed.
<dt>So is my soul become a silent place.
<dt>Oh, may I wake from this uneasy night
<dt>To find a voice of music manifold.
<dt>Let it be shape of sorrow with wan face,
<dt>Or Love that swoons on sleep, or else delight
<dt>That is as wide-eyed as a marigold.
