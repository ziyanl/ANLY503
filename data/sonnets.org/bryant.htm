<P>
<dt>A power is on the earth and in the air
<dt>From which the vital spirit shrinks afraid,
<dt>And shelters him, in nooks of deepest shade,
<dt>From the hot steam and from the fiery glare.
<dt>Look forth upon the earth--her thousand plants
<dt>Are smitten; even the dark sun-loving maize
<dt>Faints in the field beneath the torrid blaze;
<dt>The herd beside the shaded fountain pants;
<dt>For life is driven from all the landscape brown;
<dt>The bird has sought his tree, the snake his den,
<dt>The trout floats dead in the hot stream, and men
<dt>Drop by the sun-stroke in the populous town;
<dt>As if the Day of Fire had dawned, and sent
<dt>Its deadly breath into the firmament.
<P>
<a name=150></a><h2>October</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Aye, thou art welcome, heaven's delicious breath!
<dt>When woods begin to wear the crimson leaf,
<dt>And sons grow meek, and the meek suns grow brief,
<dt>And the year smiles as it draws near its death.
<dt>Wind of the sunny south! oh, still delay
<dt>In the gay woods and in the golden air,
<dt>Like to a good old age released from care,
<dt>Journeying, in long serenity, away.
<dt>In such a bright, late quiet, would that I
<dt>Might wear out life like thee, 'mid bowers and brooks,
<dt>And dearer yet, the sunshine of kind looks,
<dt>And music of kind voices ever nigh;
<dt>And when my last sand twinkled in the glass,
<dt>Pass silently from men, as thou dost pass.
<P>
<a name=200></a><h2>November</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Yet one smile more, departing, distant sun!
<dt>One mellow smile through the soft vapory air,
<dt>Ere, o'er the frozen earth, the loud winds run,
<dt>Or snows are sifted o'er the meadows bare.
<dt>One smile on the brown hills and naked trees,
<dt>And the dark rocks whose summer wreaths are cast,
<dt>And the blue gentian-flower, that, in the breeze,
<dt>Nods lonely, of her beauteous race the last.
<dt>Yet a few sunny days, in which the bee
<dt>Shall murmur by the hedge that skirts the way,
<dt>The cricket chirp upon the russet lea,
<dt>And man delight to linger in thy ray.
<dt>Yet one rich smile, and we will try to bear
<dt>The piercing winter frost, and winds, and darkened air.
<P>
<a name=300></a><h2>To an American Painter Departing for Europe</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Thine eyes shall see the light of distant skies:
<dt>Yet, Cole! thy heart shall bear to Europe's strand
<dt>A living image of thy native land,
<dt>Such as on thy own glorious canvass lies.
<dt>Lone lakes--savannahs where the bison roves--
<dt>Rocks rich with summer garlands--solemn streams--
<dt>Skies, where the desert eagle wheels and screams--
<dt>Spring bloom and autumn blaze of boundless groves
<dt>Fair scenes shall greet thee where thou goest--fair,
<dt>But different--every where the trace of men,
<dt>Paths, homes, graves, ruins, from the lowest glen
<dt>To where life shrinks from the fierce Alpine air.
<dt>Gaze on them, till the tears shall dim thy sight,
<dt>But keep that earlier, wilder image bright.
<P>

<P>
<dt>They talk of short-lived pleasure--be it so--
<dt>Pain dies as quickly: stern, hard-featured pain
<dt>Expires, and lets her weary prisoner go.
<dt>The fiercest agonies have shortest reign;
<dt>And after dreams of horror, comes again
<dt>The welcome morning with its rays of peace.
<dt>Oblivion, softly wiping out the stain,
<dt>Makes the strong secret pangs of shame to cease:
<dt>Remorse is virtue's root; its fair increase
<dt>Are fruits of innocence and blessedness:
<dt>Thus joy, o'erborne and bound, doth still release
<dt>His young limbs from the chains that round him press.
<dt>Weep not that the world changes--did it keep
<dt>A stable, changeless state, 'twere cause indeed to weep.
<P>
<a name=320></a><h2>William Tell</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Chains may subdue the feeble spirit, but thee,
<dt>Tell, of the iron heart! they coiuld not tame!
<dt>For thou wert of the mountains; they proclaim
<dt>The everlasting creed of liberty--
<dt>That creed is written on the untrampled snow,
<dt>Thundered by torrents which no power can hold,
<dt>Save that of God, when He sends forth His cold,
<dt>And breathed by winds that through the free heaven blow.
<dt>Thou, while thy prison-walls were dark around,
<dt>Didst meditate the lesson Nature taught,
<dt>And to thy brief captivity was brought
<dt>A vision of thy Switzerland unbound.
<dt>The bitter cup they mingled, strengthened thee
<dt>For the great work to set thy country free.
