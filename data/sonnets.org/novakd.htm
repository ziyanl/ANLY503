<p>
<dt>"Poets write things in which they don't believe."
<dt>What does this mean? We don't believe in love?
<dt>We don't believe that Adam and that Eve,
<dt>Our ancient parents, heard a Voice above,
<dt>Telling them not to eat that apple of
<dt>Knowledge of right and wrong? No, none of these.
<dt>It means belief, which none of us may prove,
<dt>Is not our function: those are privacies,
<dt>Specific to the soul that waits release
<dt>From bondage to the body to its greater,
<dt>Lasting and uncommemorative peace,
<dt>That happens after death, and even later.
<dt>What poets don't believe in, meaning death,
<dt>Was proved fallacious ere they drew their breath.

<p>
<dt>"Submission to the will of God" is good,
<dt>Yet what the will of God is, none can say,
<dt>Though many people have it understood,
<dt>And gladly condescend to show the way.
<dt>"The Lord wills this", "the Lord wills that," one hears,
<dt>As if they have a secret channel to
<dt>His innermost desire - their hopes and fears
<dt>As congruous with what He'd have them do.
<dt>"When Christians came, and brought the Bible, we
<dt>Possessed the land; but now we have the Bible,
<dt>They, the land" - wherefore servility
<dt>Is preached, and blasphemy a form of libel.
<dt>So Creeds have ever confiscated booty,
<dt>And yoked the dispossessed to heaven's duty.

<dt>Lithe limbs my limbs did once enfold,
<dt>Soft lips my lips did, parting, kiss,
<dt>Such grace as man may once behold
<dt>Then parting from, forever miss.
<dt>Sweet breath with my breath intermingled
<dt>As passion pressed us close together
<dt>In unison, as bodies tingled
<dt>Not knowing which was either neither.
<dt>Light-murmured words of deep import
<dt>As tuned my ear to their caressing,
<dt>As gentleness became our sport,
<dt>Gentility our only blessing.
<dt>Wild days of love, yet numbered few -
<dt>And since 'tis years, since I had you.

<p>
<dt>Soft-spoken, mild, obedient,
<dt>A good girl who believes in God,
<dt>Such was the blessing I was sent,
<dt>Who let me love her mind and bod.
<dt>She wasn't old but she was wise
<dt>In how a woman serves a man,
<dt>And gives him, not just sweetest eyes,
<dt>But her allegiance, as she can.
<dt>Devotion, Lord, and rites of passion,
<dt>As in the holy name fulfilled,
<dt>Not jealousy nor quest for fashion
<dt>To ever see his passion killed.
<dt>Forgive me, Lord, if it is wrong
<dt>For many loves as this to long.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Lord, if Thy will permits it please
<dt>Forgive my errors of the past,
<dt>And me to better days release
<dt>From misspent hopes and fears miscast.
<dt>Lord, if my body lets me have
<dt>The fairer sex to hold as mine
<dt>But as a lover, not a slave,
<dt>Obedient to things divine;
<dt>And if Thy will permits it, Lord,
<dt>A harem, and seraglio,
<dt>But pleasant, not some angry hoard,
<dt>Where I may keep my women so -
<dt>So let me, if Thou canst approve,
<dt>But let me not forsake Thy love.
<p>
<a name=047></a><h2>47</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Forgive me, God, if this is wrong,
<dt>But I believe it isn't so;
<dt>For I have had this passion strong
<dt>Since in my early days of woe.
<dt>But let Thy will be done, not mine,
<dt>And what I ask for never be
<dt>Unless with Thy intent divine
<dt>The hopes I have don't disagree.
<dt>I'd rather be a pauper poor
<dt>Devoid of even slightest ease
<dt>Than have fulfilled this wish and more
<dt>If with Thy will it disagrees.
<dt>Thy mercy, Lord, is all I ask,
<dt>To teach me to fulfill Thy task.
<p>
<a name=048></a><h2>48</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lord, this I never had to ask
<dt>Did she, my older love, remain,
<dt>Without whom life's a loathsome task,
<dt>But full of sorrow, strife, and pain;
<dt>Had she been faithful, fair and true
<dt>Much as she promised me to be,
<dt>And not to do as women do, 
<dt>Which I believed - so look at me!
<dt>My heart and soul to her I gave,
<dt>Naive because I loved too well
<dt>A person I might never have
<dt>Nor what we had must ever tell.
<dt>Wherefore, dear Lord, do I beseech
<dt>To compass loves within my reach.

<p>
<dt>These names I keep repeating, such as Keats
<dt>And Hopkins, part of the unique succession
<dt>Of poetry's transmission each one meets,
<dt>Make up my rosary, hear my confession.
<dt>These names make up my mantra I repeat,
<dt>My Japa, in my fervid state of mind
<dt>When other thoughts have all been obsolete
<dt>In guiding me, to where I am inclined.
<dt>What is this madness, Lord? What this despair
<dt>Tormenting me, and seemingly unceasing,
<dt>When all my efforts lead me to no where,
<dt>And all my burdens seem to be increasing?
<dt>Their thought, the same weird journey having taken,
<dt>Doth comfort me - that yet may be mistaken.

<p>
<dt>Dear God! a life as lived between extremes,
<dt>Either the one, intractable enforcement
<dt>Of chastity that's anchored to false dreams
<dt>Pretending to morality's endorsement;
<dt>Or else the opposite, abandonment
<dt>Of all pretense to individuation
<dt>In love's pursuit, to moral decrement - 
<dt>These both I've known, but never mediation.
<dt>God, like as land that suffers dearth and flood
<dt>In alternating waves, thus have I been;
<dt>Either too cold, or else too hot the blood,
<dt>And never gradiation in between.
<dt>Now after years of heaven, years of hell,
<dt>My body that was strong, is but a shell.

<dt>Hast dropped thy litter, pregnant Calico,
<dt>And thou a pup thyself - I see thou art
<dt>Less full in belly, which before did show
<dt>Rotund thy load, not nature's plan athwart.
<dt>So young - the neighbors seeing one depart
<dt>Its comfort's confines of thy heaving womb,
<dt>Did say of thee, "She ran off with a start
<dt>With that old Tom" - I asked who? "Old grey Tom" -
<dt>Like as to implicate thee as a mom
<dt>Unfit for child-rearing. They the kitten
<dt>Did scoop, so they did say, to take to home,
<dt>They with its weak debility all smitten.
<dt>Yet "unfit moms" so-called, are often fitter
<dt>Than high-bred dames like these to have a litter.

<p>
<dt>One must be strong; but, Father, it is hard,
<dt>So hard when all about us we observe
<dt>That falsehood and deceit seem to reward,
<dt>While truth and faith most torture that most serve.
<dt>This all have seen - and Justice only known
<dt>By its heartwrenching absence in man¹s world,
<dt>The ancient Confidence to heaven flown,
<dt>Or else down to the craggy hellholds hurled.
<dt>Yet, Lord, deliver me from the deserved,
<dt>For what do I deserve but death most foul?
<dt>Forgive me in that I have greatly swerved
<dt>From Thine intent, and nearly lost my soul
<dt>An hundred times, and body all unnerved - 
<dt>An hundred hundred times - Lord, keep me whole!

<p>
<dt>So I and thou, it could be me and you,
<dt>Kiddo, but that was once, and might have been,
<dt>But this is now, and I forever true
<dt>Could not have been, in light of what I¹ve seen.
<dt>For I have seen, abjectly, the reversal
<dt>Of every thought I thought I ever had,
<dt>My empty bag now scattered for dispersal,
<dt>Its contents mostly good when they are bad.
<dt>So furthermore, on thee I lavish praise
<dt>To mock myself, that is cheap counterfeit
<dt>Of thee, derived from thee, whom I always
<dt>Do plunder for my thought's unlettered writ.
<dt>So, so it goes. Thou reader, stand unfazed:
<dt>For if you saw her face, you'd be amazed.
