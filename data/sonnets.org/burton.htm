<p><h2><a name="library"></a>In a Library</h2>
<dt>A wealth of silence, that is all.&nbsp; The air
<dt>Lacks life and holds no hint of tender spring,
<dt>Of flowers wholesome-blowing, birds a-wing,
<dt>Of any creature much-alive and fair.
<dt>Perhaps you guess a murmur here and there
<dt>Among the tomes, each book a gossip thing,
<dt> And each in her own tongue,—yet slumbering
<dt>  Seems more the bookish fashion everywhere.
<dt>       
<dt>&nbsp;       
<dt>And yet, could but the souls take flesh again
<dt>That wrought these words, their hearts all passion-swirled,
<dt>What companies would flock and fill the stage,
<dt>  Resuming now their old, imperious reign,
<dt>Knight, noble, lady, priest, the saint, and sage,
<dt>The valor, bloom, and wisdom of a world!
<dt>
<h2><a name="poet"></a>The Poet</h2>       
<dt>He's not alone&nbsp;an artist weak and white,
<dt>   O'erbending scented paper toying there
<dt>With languid fancies, fashioned deft and fair,
<dt>Mere sops to time between the day and night.
<dt>He is a poor torn soul who sees aright
<dt>How far he fails of living out the rare
<dt>Night-visions God vouchsafes along the air,
<dt>Until the pain burns hot, beyond his might.
<dt>       
<dt>&nbsp;       
<dt>  The heart-beat of the universal will
<dt>He hears, and, spite of blindness and disproof,
<dt>Can sense amidst the jar a singing fine.
<dt>Grief-smitten that his lyre should lack the skill
<dt>To speak it plain, he plays in paths aloof,
<dt>And knows the trend is starward, life divine.
<dt>
<h2><a name="unpraised"></a>An Unpraised Picture</h2>       
<dt> I saw a picture once by Angelo,—
<dt>"Unfinished," said the critic, "done in youth,"—
<dt>And that was all, no thought of praise, forsooth!
<dt>He was informed, and doubtless it was so.
<dt>And yet I let an hour of dreaming go
<dt>The way of all time, touched to tears and ruth,
<dt>Passion and joy, the prick of Conscience's tooth
<dt>Before that careworn Christ's divine, soft glow.
<dt>       
<dt>&nbsp;       
<dt> The painter's yearning with an unsure hand
<dt>Had moved me more than might his master days:
<dt>He seemed to speak like one whose Mecca land
<dt>Is first beheld, tho' faint and far the ways;
<dt>Who may not then his shaken voice command,
<dt>Yet trembles forth a word of prayer and praise.

<h2><a name="if"></a>If So</h2>
<p>
<dt>If so there were a spirit, poised in peace
<dt>Above all wind-gusts in the heavens high,
<dt>And he might mark us mortals laugh or cry,
<dt>According as the glooméd clouds increase
<dt>Or suns beguile them into golden fleece,
<dt>Methinks he would be like to smile to sigh
<dt>(So placid he, so far within the sky,
<dt>And knowing God's great love can never cease),
<dt>That we the puny yet the prideful race
<dt>Must change as skies change; be like babes that fret
<dt>Whenso their yearning mother moves her breast
<dt>To ease her mothering, or turns her face
<dt>Aside a moment, reaching out to get
<dt>Some wrapping soft to lull their limbs to rest.
