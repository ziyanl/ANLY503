<p>
<dt>Lady! no marvel that the kinsman young
<dt>Of the grand master of the mystery
<dt>Of metaphysics, fell in love with thee;
<dt>Nor yet that while the stage, jumbling along,
<dt>Soothed him to slumber with its one dull song,
<dt>As towards the land of lakes and poesy
<dt>The wayward youth rode nightly journeying,--he
<dt>Over thy imagined form in visions hung.
<dt>For thou hast charms to warm a colder breast
<dt>Than that of youthful poet: locks like night;
<dt>Cheeks of rich bloom, where love hath built his nest;
<dt>Looks like young Juno's; eyes from whose full glance
<dt>The gazer shrinks abashed, as in the fight
<dt>The polished shield returns the warrior's lance.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Return of Spring</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I looked for thy return, belov&eacute;d spring!
<dt>As with a sick man's wish, I pined for thee,
<dt>A weak and fretful longing; for to me,
<dt>I thought, thy coming would renewal bring
<dt>Of powers and loves, now slowly perishing;
<dt>Thy soft clear sun, thy buds on ground and tree
<dt>Opening, the glad tumultuous melody
<dt>Of thy young birds, each new and lovely thing
<dt>Within my breast the selfsame joy would wake
<dt>They waked of old. O fond! to deem the spell
<dt>Of outward beauty could have power to make
<dt>Him happy, in whose heart the living well
<dt>Of happiness is dried! Thou camest at last
<dt>And, ere I felt thy presence, thou wast past.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>To Catharine Seyton</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>So thou wouldst tempt me, pretty neophyte,
<dt>Me, bred in those learn&eacute;d halls whose sons erst broke,
<dt>With arm polemic, Rome's usurp&eacute; yoke,
<dt>Though all unfit to wage--with eyes so bright
<dt>And smiles so sweet--the controversial fight;
<dt>Me, whom no few as Methodist assail,
<dt>Me thou wouldst tempt to quit the happy pale
<dt>Of England's Church, to pope and priest my right
<dt>Of thought resigning.
<dt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cherish, gentle friend,
<dt>The new-found light, if light it be, and tread
<dt>Thy clouded path to heaven: and let me wend
<dt>My way, with difficulty sore bested,
<dt>Nor needing more incumbrances, alone,
<dt>Free from thy Church's fetters, and thy own!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>"They say that thou wert lovely on thy bier"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>They say that thou wert lovely on thy bier,
<dt>More lovely than in life; that when the thrall
<dt>Of earth was loosed, it seemed as though a pall
<dt>Of years were lifted, and thou didst appear
<dt>Such as of old amidst thy home's calm sphere
<dt>Thou sat'st, a kindly Presence felt by all
<dt>In joy or grief, from morn to evening-fall,
<dt>The peaceful Genius of that mansion dear.
<dt>Was it the craft of all-persuading Love
<dt>That wrought this marvel? or is Death indeed
<dt>A mighty master, gifted from above
<dt>With alchemy benign, to wounded hearts
<dt>Minist'ring thus, by quaint and subtle arts,
<dt>Strange comfort, whereon after-thought may feed?
