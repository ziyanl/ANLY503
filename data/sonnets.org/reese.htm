<a name=010></a><h2>Tell Me Some Way</h2>
<p>
<dt>Oh, you who love me not, tell me some way
<dt>Whereby I may forget you for a space;
<dt>Nay, clean forget you and your lovely face--
<dt>Yet well I know how vain this prayer I pray.
<dt>All weathers hold you. Can I make the May
<dt>Forbid her boughs blow white in every place?
<dt>Or rob June of her rose that comes apace?
<dt>Cheat of their charm the elder months and gray?
<dt>Aye, were you dead, you could not be forgot;
<dt>So sparse the bloom along the lanes would be;
<dt>Such sweetness out the briery hedges fled;
<dt>My tears would fall that you had loved me not;
<dt>And bitterer tears that you had gone from me;
<dt>Living you break my heart, so would you dead!

<a name=020></a><h2>Tears</h2>
<dt>When I consider Life and its few years --
<dt>A wisp of fog betwixt us and the sun;
<dt>A call to battle, and the battle done
<dt>Ere the last echo dies within our ears;
<dt>A rose choked in the grass; an hour of fears;
<dt>The gusts that past a darkening shore do beat;
<dt>The burst of music down an unlistening street,--
<dt>I wonder at the idleness of tears.
<p>
<dt>Ye old, old dead, and ye of yesternight
<dt>Chieftains, and bards, and keepers of the sheep
<dt>By every cup of sorrow that you had,
<dt>Loose me from tears, and make me see aright
<dt>How each hath back at once he stayed to weep:
<dt>Homer his sight, David his little lad!
