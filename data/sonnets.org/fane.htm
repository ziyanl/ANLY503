<dt>How many a year hath Time, with felon hand
<dt>Filched from the sum of my alloted days,
<dt>Alas, with no performance that may stand
<dt>In warrant of a well-earned meed of praise!
<dt>Time hath the forehead of my life belined,
<dt>And clipt my youth with his accurs&egrave;d shears,
<dt>Hath made companionable Joy unkind,
<dt>And taught mine eyes the fellowship of tears.
<dt>His false hands falsely have my mind assailed,
<dt>Thence stealing many a secret of sweet pleasure;
<dt>But his foiled fingers nothing have prevailed
<dt>Against my heart--the casket of my treasure.
<dt>My love of thee preserved in its fresh prime,
<dt>I, robbed, left rich; how poor a thief is Time!

<p>
<dt>O visioned face, unutterably fair,
<dt>How oft when blackness muffled up the night,
<dt>And tempest-laden was the surcharged air,
<dt>Nor any hope appeared of starry light,
<dt>How often, lucent as the full-faced moon,
<dt>When suddenly she rends the clouded fleece,
<dt>Hath thy sweet influence, like an unhoped boon,
<dt>Turned dark to bright, and tempest into peace!
<dt>Queen of my night of sorrows hast thou been,
<dt>Whose countenance of good all evil mars,
<dt>Knowing to crown with hopeful light serene
<dt>Earth's darksome vault when most forlorn of stars,
<dt>And to convert clouds bodeful of despair
<dt>To silver-suited omens good and fair.
