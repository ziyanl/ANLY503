<a name=010></a><h2>The Zone of Calms</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As yearning currents from the trackless snows,
<dt>And silent Polar seas, unceasing sweep
<dt>To South, to North, and linger not where leap
<dt>Red fires from glistening cones,--nor where the rose
<dt>Has triumph on the snow-fed Paramos,
<dt>In upper air,--nor yet where lifts the deep
<dt>Its silver Atollis on whose bosoms sleep
<dt>The purple sponges; and, as in repose
<dt>Meeting at last, they sink upon the breast
<dt>Of that sweet tropic sea, whose spicy balms
<dt>And central heat have drawn them to its arms,--
<dt>So soul seeks soul, unsatisfied, represt,
<dt>Till in Love's tropic met, they sink to rest,
<dt>At peace forever in the "Zone of Calms."
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Poppies on the Wheat</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Along Ancona's hills the shimmering heat,
<dt>A tropic tide of air with ebb and flow
<dt>Bathes all the fields of wheat until they glow
<dt>Like flashing seas of green, which toss and beat
<dt>Around the vines. The poppies lithe and fleet
<dt>Seem running, fiery torchment, to and fro
<dt>To mark the shore.
<dd>The farmer does not know
<dt>That they are there. He walks with heavy feet,
<dt>Counting the bread and wine by autumn's gain,
<dt>But I,--I smile to think that days remain
<dt>Perhaps to me in which, though bread be sweet
<dt>No more, and red wine warm my blood in vain,
<dt>I shall be glad remembering how the fleet,
<dt>Lithe poppies ran like torchmen with the wheat.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Mazzini</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>That he is dead the sons of kings are glad;
<dt>And in their beds the tyrants sounder sleep.
<dt>Now he is dead his martyrdom will reap
<dt>Late harvest of the palms it should have had
<dt>In life. Too late the tardy lands are sad.
<dt>His unclaimed crown in secret they will keep
<dt>For ages, while in chains they vainly weep,
<dt>And vainly grope to find the roads he bade
<dt>Them take. O glorious soul! there is no dearth
<dt>Of worlds. There must be many better worth
<dt>Thy presence and thy leadership than this.
<dt>No doubt, on some great sun to-day, thy birth
<dt>Is for a race, the dawn of Freedom's bliss,
<dt>Which but for thee it might for ages miss.

<a name=040></a><h2>Burnt Ships</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O Love, sweet Love, who came with rosy sail
<dt>And foaming prow across the misty sea!
<dt>O Love, brave Love, whose faith was full and free
<dt>That lands of sun and gold, which could not fail,
<dt>Lay in the west, that bloom no wintry gale
<dt>Could blight, and eyes whose love thine own should be,
<dt>Called thee, with steadfast voice of prophecy,
<dt>To shores unknown!
<dd>O Love, poor Love, avail
<dt>Thee nothing now thy faiths, thy braveries;
<dt>There is no sun, no bloom; a cold wind strips
<dt>The bitter foam from off the wave where dips
<dt>No more thy prow; the eyes are hostile eyes;
<dt>The gold is hidden; vain thy tears and cries;
<dt>O Love, poor Love, why didst thou burn thy ships?

<a name=050></a><h2>Tides</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O patient shore, thou canst not go to meet
<dt>Thy love, the restless sea, how comfortest
<dt>Thou all thy loneliness? Art thou at rest,
<dt>When, loosing his strong arms from round thy feet,
<dt>He turns away? Know'st thou, however sweet
<dt>That other shore may be, that to thy breast
<dt>He must return? And when in sterner test
<dt>He folds thee to a heart which does not beat,
<dt>Wraps thee in ice, and gives no smile, no kiss,
<dt>To break long wintry days, still dost thou miss
<dt>Naught from thy trust? Still wait, unfaltering,
<dt>The higher, warmer waves which leap in spring?
<dt>O sweet, wise shore, to be so satisfied!
<dt>O heart, learn from the shore! Love has a tide!
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Her Eyes</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>That they are brown, no man will dare to say
<dt>He knows. And yet I think that no man's look
<dt>Ever those depths of light and shade forsook,
<dt>Until their gentle pain warned him away.
<dt>Of all sweet things I know but one which may
<dt>Be likened to her eyes.
<dd>When, in deep nook
<dt>Of some green field, the water of a brook
<dt>Makes lingering whirling eddy in its way,
<dt>Round soft drowned leaves; and in a flash of sun
<dt>They turn to gold, until the ripples run
<dt>Now brown, now yellow, changing as by some
<dt>Swift spell.
<dd>I know not with what body come
<dt>The saints. But this I know, my Paradise
<dt>Will mean the resurrection of her eyes.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>Fealty</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The thing I count and hold as fealty--
<dt>The only fealty to give or take--
<dt>Doth never reckoning keep, and coldly make
<dt>Bond to itself with this or that to be
<dt>Content as wage; the wage unpaid, to free
<dt>Its hand from service, and its love forsake,
<dt>Its faith cast off, as one from dreams might wake
<dt>At morn, and smiling watch the vision flee.
<dt>Such fealty is treason in disguise,
<dt>Who trusts it, his death-warrant sealed doth bear.
<dt>Love looks at it with angry, wondering eyes;
<dt>Love knows the face true fealty doth wear,
<dt>The pulse that beats unchanged by alien air,
<dt>Or hurts, or crimes, until the loved one dies.
