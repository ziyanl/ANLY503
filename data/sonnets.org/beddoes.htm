<p>
<dt>So thou art come again, old black-winged night,
<dt>Like an huge bird, between us and the sun,
<dt>Hiding with out-stretched form the genial light;
<dt>And still beneath thine icy bosom's dun
<dt>And cloudy plumage hatching fog-breathed blight
<dt>And embryo storms and crabb&eacute;d frosts, that shun
<dt>Day's warm caress. The owls from ivied loop
<dt>Are shrieking homage, as thou towerest high;
<dt>Like sable crow pausing in eager stoop
<dt>On the dim world thou gluttest thy clouded eye,
<dt>Silently waiting latest time's fell whoop,
<dt>When thou shalt quit thine eyrie in the sky,
<dt>To pounce upon the world with eager claw,
<dt>And tomb time, death, and substance in thy maw.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>A Rivulet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It is a lovely stream; its wavelets purl
<dt>As if they echoed to the fall and rise
<dt>Of the capricious breeze; each upward curl
<dt>That splashes pearl, mirrors the fairy eyes
<dt>Of viewless passer, and the billows hurl
<dt>Their sparkles on her lap, as over she flies.
<dt>And see, where onward whirls, within a ring
<dt>Of smoothest dimples, a dark foxglove bell
<dt>Half stifled by the gush encircling;
<dt>Perchance some tiny sprite crawled to that shell
<dt>To sleep away the noon, and winds did swing
<dt>Him into rest; for the warm sun was well
<dt>Shaded off by the long and silky down;
<dt>So I will save it, lest the elf should drown.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>To Tartar, a Terrier Beauty</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Snowdrop of dogs with ear of brownest dye
<dt>Like the last orphan leaf of naked tree
<dt>Which shudders in bleak autumn; though by thee,
<dt>Of hearing careless and untutored eye,
<dt>Not understood articulate speech of men
<dt>Nor marked the artificial mind of books--
<dt>The mortal's voice eternized by the pen--
<dt>Yet hast thou thought and language all unknown
<dt>To Babel's scholars; oft intensest looks,
<dt>Long scrutiny over some dark-veined stone
<dt>Dost thou bestow, learning dead mysteries
<dt>Of the world's birthday, oft in eager tone
<dt>With quick-tailed fellows bandiest prompt replies,
<dt>Solicitudes canine, four-footed amities.
