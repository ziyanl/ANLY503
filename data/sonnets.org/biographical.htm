<h3>Dedicated to Madame E. Schuman-Heink</h3>
<p>
<dt>Music! When through my heart, in youth's bright morn
<dt>Your flow began to surge, emotions known
<dt>To that glad time found overflow in tone,
<dt>You were confessional! Then overborn
<dt>In tumultuous tests, with rushing wind and storm,
<dt>The shell of life was hither, thither blown.
<dt>Though only echoes lingered--old forms had flown--
<dt>Still melody my searching hours transform.
<p>
<dt>I need not seek beyond the night bird's song,
<dt>Soaring in melody, above the tree;
<dt>And now a human voice in ethereal praise,
<dt>Answers from deep to deep, until we long
<dt>To merge our own in reneed minstrelsy,
<dt>And free all aching hearts for singing days.
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>II. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>1933</h3>
<p>
<dt>An old poem returns in this our time,
<dt>Singing as sweetly as in days gone by,
<dt>Tuned to rhythm that can never die,
<dt>And yet my heart is quiet, for I pine
<dt>For a lost presence that leaves no sign--
<dt>A shadowy self that once would smile and sigh,
<dt>And muse in memory old verse to try,
<dt>That one might trace the form behind the line.
<p>
<dt>Oh heart leap up again! Just once impart
<dt>The fire that animated what was read,
<dt>Again possess the line, the poet's dream,
<dt>And in a flash reveal the magic art
<dt>That creates truth! Leave now no word unsaid
<dt>To kindle in the hearts of men, the gleam.
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>III. Emily Dickinson</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>And still you scorn the confines life would cast
<dt>About your fixed and marked identity.
<dt>A father, lover, friend tried endlessly,
<dt>And all the cycled censors failed at last.
<dt>Now resurrected in your revived past,
<dt>At signal of the butterfly and bee,
<dt>Witness your love wedded in mystery!
<dt>Beyond the book, the dream once believed, you clasp.
<p>
<dt>Not what we read or see or trace in line, 
<dt>Becomes the ultimate of greater worth;
<dt>It is the dream we hold as our own right
<dt>Unseen by men, but envied for the sign
<dt>It shines upon the face of these on earth
<dt>Who cling to love and faith beyond the light.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(After seeing "Alison's House" at the Community Theatre, Pasadena.)
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>IV. Edwin Arlington Robinson</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>More than a measured space, the searching heart
<dt>Has granted to this herald far ahead;
<dt>We scarce outline his shadowed counterpart
<dt>As down the hurrying years his light is shed.
<dt>A modern man! Tradition's silhouette!
<dt>In that supremacy secure, he folds
<dt>The barrier that will signify our debt,
<dt>When Time acknowledges the gifts he holds.
<p>
<dt>His light outlines memorials in our day.
<dt>His words speak for the shattered songs of men.
<dt>Lighting the Titan with a piercing ray,
<dt>We are made one with prophecy again.
<dt>Futurity extends a sheltering palm,
<dt>And safely draws the poet's dream to calm.
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>V. Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Beyond the dark, beyond the lighted mote,
<dt>We share your depth and pinnacle of dream,
<dt>We crave the ecstasy of higher note,
<dt>Searching the lanes where late you traced the gleam.
<dt>In shadowed brightness now you hover near.
<dt>Why trails your pinion in the breaking dawn?
<dt>You haunt the gray 'twixt joy and mortal fear.
<dt>Yours is the sweetest, saddest voice we muse upon.
<p>
<dt>Your wistful words in careless fancy wrought
<dt>May answer for our heart's perplexity,
<dt>Restore that moment when your spirit thought
<dt>Hung pendant, trusting all eternity.
<dt>So may a single bird, unsought, unseen,
<dt>Trace heaven's hope above Time's tarnished green.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(After hearing Miss Millay at Ebell.)
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>VI. Robert Frost</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The little plot I claim for my new share,
<dt>May be stony, harsh and rough with rock--
<dt>A spot, that idle men are wont to mock
<dt>And curse as never worth a wise man's care.
<dt>I leave to them the right to choose and dare.
<dt>I never gauge my labor by the clock.
<dt>The Fall may never bring my grain to shock,
<dt>Yet on my hearth, my fire, my fruit I share.
<p>
<dt>The rough endurance of an earlier day
<dt>Survives and shapes the will to fit the need,
<dt>And though the ancient quarrel can smart and goad,
<dt>The back bends to the task, the furrowed way.
<dt>Man dream that Mother Earth will bless the load;
<dt>His hope vaults high to ride the harvest load.
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>VII. Willa Cather</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Soul searching, thou hast journeyed far and wide
<dt>On dusty pilgrimages, charting the day
<dt>For those whose fading forms your power would stay
<dt>And fix forever where great truths abide,
<dt>Surely in seeking, you will never hide
<dt>One portrait, lest at teh last, in Time's own way,
<dt>Our measure be still less than what men say,
<dt>And all we might bequeath in you will bide.
<p>
<dt>For all the raising of the lifeless forms,--
<dt>That imminence of birth and death revealed;
<dt>For every waking figure,--cold, now warm
<dt>With confirmation and with wonder sealed,
<dt>The soul acknowledges the breaking light,
<dt>And walks with former tread out of the night.
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>VIII. The Physician</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>Dedicated to Dr. John Busby</h3>
<p>
<dt>I heard a great physician gently say,
<dt>Not one man's life raised up for price or fame,
<dt>But one gift made to lift the curse of pain,
<dt>One life of effort, just to add one ray
<dt>Of brighter living, in our human day.
<dt>To fix a bit of life where death has lain,
<dt>To bless one tortured soul where strength might wane,
<dt>Exceeds the wealth a suffering would would pay.
<p>
<dt>For every man who counts his gifts for gain,
<dt>A hundred stand to help men on their way,
<dt>No finer, truer souls push back the pall,
<dt>Than those who stand to guard the gates of pain.
<dt>No gold can recompense the part they play,
<dt>Fighting, they watch life's curtains rise and fall.
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>IX. The Scientist</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>Dedicated to Dr. Robert Millikan</h3>
<p>
<dt>There was one among them spoke as a child,
<dt>Confessed he questioned what he ought to know,
<dt>Some answer that true knowledge would bestow
<dt>If he were ready!  And in spirit mild
<dt>He must have grasped the truth, for we beguiled,
<dt>Stand by and marvel that so far below,
<dt>Our little minds question and rarely go
<dt>Along the mounting trail so strange, so wild!
<p>
<dt>He pushes past the last guide post to press
<dt>A print to mark the taking of the place.
<dt>Defying precedent, the truth he would forecast
<dt>Into a newer realm, beyond the stress
<dt>Of man's vast ignorance of time and space,
<dt>That other souls might read the law at last.
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>X. The Preacher</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>Dedicated to Dr. Robert Freeman</h3>
<p>
<dt>"A dead dog speaks," so runs the preacher's text--
<dt>An ancient line of truth, a paradox,
<dt>That might be listed with the line that shocks
<dt>And holds our thought and some way almost next
<dt>We pause and read no more until the next
<dt>Head line allures. But even then truth mocks,
<dt>And he who turns to question and unlocks
<dt>The truth of dog and speech may use the text.
<p>
<dt>'Tis said, the Christ spoke many a long lost word,
<dt>As fraught with life as those we often quote,
<dt>And once when suddenly He sensed the death
<dt>Of some poor dog, the hurrying crowd then heard
<dt>These strange words rise from Him, who stopped to note
<dt>The cur "His teeth are whiter than pearls" He saith.
<p>
<a name=011></a><h2>XI. To a Modern Painter</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If from the chaos in the picture's frame,
<dt>There finally emerge a figure fair,
<dt>It seems a miracle the brush must dare
<dt>If the creator seek for modern fame.
<dt>Perhaps only an initiate dare name
<dt>These half real beings,--puppets that seem to stare
<dt>Out through the maze and wait for those who care
<dt>Enough to recognize them without blame.
<p>
<dt>So often seems the picture of our day,
<dt>A mass of unrelated forms and light,
<dt>And if there be a few who see it real,
<dt>Who sense the revelation and dare say
<dt>"There moves a figure to our deepening sight,"
<dt>From that admission, Truth may make its seal.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(After hearing Sarah Bixby Smith relate an experience with a modern picture.)
<p>
<a name=012></a><h2>XII. The New Teacher</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>Dedicated to Albert Edward Wiggam</h3>
<p>
<dt>Far have I wandered in the mind's long quest,
<dt>And many teachers have I called by name,--
<dt>Past all the goals that mark youth's end and aim,
<dt>Now spurs again the urge that knows no rest.
<dt>Which is the trail to take? Is this way best?
<dt>With soul more cautious and aware, the same
<dt>Vast range reveals new heights to claim,
<dt>And fewer guides to chart the heart's new test.
<p>
<dt>Now be it found, that clearly height on height,
<dt>The mind retain no excess, hopeless load,
<dt>So when wisdom descends to guide the will,
<dt>All stands, revealed as when a burning light
<dt>Is set by unseen hands beside a road,
<dt>And so we safely climb and round the hill.
<p>
<a name=013></a><h2>XIII. Herbert Hoover</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>1931</h3>
<p>
<dt>A father is our greatest need today!
<dt>For all our willful, careless venturing,
<dt>But though one move and act for us,--sighing
<dt>We see him not or understand the way
<dt>He marks from dark to light, and still men say
<dt>All, all is night! Where is the soul we sing!
<dt>"Land of the Pilgrim's pride"! Better to bring
<dt>A mumbled word, than no homage to pay!
<p>
<dt>Yet fatherlike he stands for us and prays,
<dt>His judgment and his power may be our strength.
<dt>He knows our human need, our old time fears,
<dt>And though it seem his cautious arm delays,
<dt>His eye surveys our land--its breadth, its length--
<dt>O will he guide us through when this storm clears?
<p>
<a name=014></a><h2>XIV. To Mr. and Mrs. Edward MacDowell</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Along the sunny side of the woodland path,
<dt>The wild rose hedge now dons its new green gown.
<dt>Now blooms the rose, far from the gardened town!
<dt>Now wafts the perfume, which no other bloom hath
<dt>Distilled or dreamed might be. Though winter's wrath
<dt>Touched all the man made gardens, on hill and down
<dt>Wild roses wreathe again the Spring's gay crown--
<dt>An old time grace renews the smile, the laugh!
<p>
<dt>Here is a hope to build through cloud and sun.
<dt>What though the blossom breathe for one brief hour?
<dt>The mystery lives in the heart that knows
<dt>True beauty, believing that the Spring will come
<dt>Strewing pale petals, and the perfumed flower
<dt>That has never changed,--Oh sweet wild rose!
<p>
<a name=015></a><h2>XV. Dorothea Hoaglin Hayden</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Some gifts a moneyed man can buy for gold!
<dt>For treasures, from your singing heart I long.
<dt>O friend, now give to me your rarer song,
<dt>For on that coral bank, grown slowly old
<dt>Maturing beauty broods and will enfold
<dt>The precious residue of dreams. No curse or wrong
<dt>Has marred your gift, but strong as love is strong
<dt>Your cadenced word reveals what life might hold!
<p>
<dt>Serenity, exceeding what the will might school.
<dt>Courageous evidence of tested worth!
<dt>A charity facing the world's demands!
<dt>All this I recognize in this carved jewel
<dt>That has evolved from your fair shore of youth--
<dt>A perfect part of the true whole, it stands.
<p>
<a name=016></a><h2>XVI. Helena Modjeska</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As we hear the nocturne rising once more,
<dt>Flowing through unseen hands caressingly,
<dt>The power of music rifts our apathy.
<dt>Unvoiced longings, uncharted hopes--the store
<dt>Youth yields to age, rise in the heart's deep core.
<dt>Song phrasings linger still and certainly
<dt>We follow up the strain and memory
<dt>Recalls the way that love once sang its lore.
<p>
<dt>Then the recurring cadence rose supreme
<dt>Above life's jangled strains and so it grew
<dt>To dominate the perfect arc, the heart
<dt>Declared high festival, part real, part dream.
<dt>And now there sounds a beat, the artist knew
<dt>While faint and fainter sounds the singing part.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(After hearing Ralph Modjeska play the Rain Drop Prelude.)
<p>
<a name=017></a><h2>XVII. To My Three Children</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>Arthur, William, Anne Belle</h3>
<p>
<dt>My children are my own interpreters
<dt>Of this strange modern world of ours,
<dt>That seems to yield no keys, no pass, no powers
<dt>Into my hands, unless perchance the spurs
<dt>That now and then I loan, and there occurs
<dt>So grave a doubt, such hounding of the hours,
<dt>I choose to trust the child, that never cowers
<dt>That I may share his lot, whate'er incurs.
<p>
<dt>One sweeps the univers, unseen but heart;
<dt>One loafs along the field, the stream, the height;
<dt>One delves into the mind's rich vein of ore.
<dt>And Mother-like I pray some magic word
<dt>Of mine be near, if tears should blind their sight,
<dt>And may my love illumine more and more.
<p>
<a name=018></a><h2>XVIII. The Astronomer</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Perhaps unseeing through Mount Wilson's eye
<dt>We look; beside us looms one that can see!
<dt>Speechless, we leave the modern laboratory,
<dt>Recalling, just a flash of truth, we sigh
<dt>Confounded by the answer to our Why?
<dt>No man can comprehend for certainty
<dt>The workings of a soul to set life free,
<dt>Because the soul is high, as heaven is high.
<p>
<dt>Posterity lives in the Einstein mind,
<dt>It traces out the maze of Michelson,
<dt>It works within the brain of Millikan,
<dt>And if we marvel, how its findings bind
<dt>Our common soul,--each age has sought and won
<dt>A power, unseen, that would lift up all men.
<p>
<a name=019></a><h2>XIX. William Shakespeare</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>1933</h3>
<p>
<dt>Bard immortal, your word is as a ledge
<dt>On which men lean and vision life at best.
<dt>Alas! that Lachesis withheld the pledge
<dt>That every verse of worth will now attest!
<dt>Those seeing eyes that see not ever quail--
<dt>Their length or lot of life determines sight.
<dt>I stand condemned if in my day I fail
<dt>To meet your word and there behold the light.
<p>
<dt>Were it not fitting then, serving life's hours
<dt>To bear the best a poet's heart e'er gives
<dt>And measure to this heritage of ours,
<dt>Nor miss one cadenced line where Shakespeare lives?
<dt>"The April of his prime" speaks in this place--
<dt>Through windows of my age his light I trace.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Sent to the opening of the Stratford Theater.)

<a name=020></a><h2>XX. To My Grandmothers</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>Elisa Van Osdall, Ann Lovejoy Churchill</h3>
<p>
<dt>I note your shawl, bonnet and sturdy shoe
<dt>Your dress, your swinging step, your out-stretched hand,
<dt>Your forward searching eye across the land.
<dt>I trace my own ancestry back through you!
<dt>No longer is your figure strange and new
<dt>But animated with the forms that stand
<dt>Enshrined in memory,--the Mother band
<dt>That followed to the west, so fine, so true!
<p>
<dt>That soul that spurned the Allegheny range!
<dt>That one adventuring far, far, beyond
<dt>The Vermont hills and destined to meet its own
<dt>Again and yet again to pass. So strange
<dt>The emerging! A child and Mother fond
<dt>Still following the lure of fire and home.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Reflections on The Pioneer Mother, at Upland, Calif.)
<p>
<a name=021></a><h2>XXI. Hildegarde Flanner</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Today all barriers in your garden lift!
<dt>An instant and the poet in your breast
<dt>Swings on the compass of the further west
<dt>And you become a dream of wings that drift
<dt>On upper reaches where the eye may rift
<dt>Uncharted places and put earth to test.
<dt>Proven--your words anchor the souls unrest.
<dt>The flowering magic of the ash I sift!
<p>
<dt>And now I wait, reluctant that I leave
<dt>This endeared spot, where mysteries are wrought--
<dt>The pool's mirror, the star dust on the green,
<dt>The eerie sense of some one at my sleeve.
<dt>All the reality the curious sought
<dt>Is dimmed at sight of one in silver sheen.
<p>
<a name=022></a><h2>XXII. Frederick Warde</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thy artistry has touched all types of men
<dt>And fashioned them again to forms we know
<dt>So when the curtain rises 'tis as though
<dt>They speak again. Father Serra then
<dt>Enters Mission Walls and roses blow as when
<dt>He spoke. And now I hear the voice of Romeo
<dt>In gardens where our loves in May still go
<dt>So plays thy voice, the harp Aeolion!
<p>
<dt>Old Lear hath found a gratitude in thee
<dt>And Woolsey proves sincerity through you,
<dt>And if for sight of all the Seven Ages.
<dt>I seek a miniature, behold I see
<dt>Its perfect form. To every man his due
<dt>Master of Make Believe, we are your pages!
<p>
<a name=023></a><h2>XXIII. To Garden Lovers</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>Dedicated to Katherine Rogers</h3>
<p>
<dt>Let others plant vast gardens. I am content
<dt>With tiny little plots--a pansy bed,
<dt>A row of gardenias, some white, some red,
<dt>And to a sunny spot, Daphne is sent
<dt>With tiny corsages of rarest scent.
<dt>Through every season by my garden led
<dt>I wake to be surprised, turning my head
<dt>To meet the splendor Midas must have lent.
<p>
<dt>Ah, gay woodbine against the stony wall,
<dt>And goldenrod, I thought you'd gone to seed,
<dt>The purple aster sways,--its color fills
<dt>The patio. The orange tree blooms, and all
<dt>The roses bare an opening bud, nor heed
<dt>That frost creeps down the Pasadena hills.
<p>
<a name=024></a><h2>XXIV. To My Challenged Self</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>Suggested by a line of Fanny Hodges Newman</h3>
<h4>"My heart was singing in another place."</h4>
<p>
<dt>My shut-in window framed for me today
<dt>The morning light upon a flowering tree
<dt>A brooding bird, a gay one soaring free!
<dt>As swiftly flashed the pictures, day did pass
<dt>And ere the setting sun burnished my glass
<dt>A leaf appeared to dance in ecstasy,
<dt>And suddenly, no leaf my eye could see!
<dt>Beyond my seeing eye the wonders pass!
<p>
<dt>Now fleeting shadows seem my dreams to woo;
<dt>A tireless spinner threads a web of lace;
<dt>The tall pine tree is tipped with newer green,
<dt>And where aerial wires appear as new
<dt>The shore of cloud land I can clearly trace.
<dt>Now stars appear as guides to worlds unseen.

<h4>President of The United States</h4>
<p>
<dt>A Nation brings its proven gifts to you!
<dt>Take home these flowers from ashes and from tears,
<dt>They are the blossoms of our harrowed years,
<dt>Strong in the strain of native growth, yet new
<dt>And burgeoning as sturdy plants will do.
<dt>They have survived a storm of crushing fears;
<dt>They have withstood the blight of cruel jeers;
<dt>Now in God's cycled time, the flowers are due.
<p>
<dt>No wealth or worldly thing could bring more power--
<dt>A warmer heart beats for humanity,
<dt>And more unselfishly men act today.
<dt>In this your time and deep prophetic hour
<dt>Men bear; the stoics smile in irony;
<dt>America is furrowing a way!
<p>
<a name=026></a><h2>XXVI. Acknowledgment</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Beyond the years, there is for us somewhere
<dt>A haven, that will salvage all life's gifts
<dt>A sheltered harbor where in dreams one drifts.
<dt>Against that time, I chart the souls I dare
<dt>To prophesy are those whose gifts we share
<dt>Today and then. So may the Truth that rifts
<dt>Our cloudy sky, be as a beam that lifts
<dt>In clear relief, the features Time calls fair.
<p>
<dt>Now to my countrymen in heart and time,
<dt>I offer neither proof nor record here,
<dt>Rather affection's charting of the dream
<dt>Of high endeavor in its earthly climb.
<dt>Forgive those tracings, not altogether clear,
<dt>Enshrine within your hold the talent's gleam.
