<p><a href="#300">Silence</a> actually has fifteen lines but seems to belong here.  The "dear name" concealed within <a href="#200">An Enigma</a> can be found by reading the first letter of the first line, the second letter of the second line, etc. to the end of the sonnet--she was a poet and friend of Poe's.

<p>
<dt>Science! True daughter of Old Time thou art!
<dt>Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
<dt>Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,
<dt>Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
<dt>How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
<dt>Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
<dt>To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
<dt>Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
<dt>Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
<dt>And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
<dt>To seek a shelter in some happier star?
<dt>Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
<dt>The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
<dt>The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?
</p>
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>An Enigma</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>"Seldom we find," says Solomon Don Dunce,
<dt>"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
<dt>Through all the flimsy things we see at once
<dt>As easily as through a Naples bonnet--
<dt>Trash of all trash?--how <i>can</i> a lady don it?
<dt>Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff--
<dt>Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
<dt>Twirls into trunk-paper while you con it."
<dt>And, veritable, Sol is right enough.
<dt>The general tuckermanities are arrant
<dt>Bubbles--ephemeral and <i>so</i> transparent--
<dt>But <i>this</i> is, now,--you may depend on it--
<dt>Stable, opaque, immortal--all by dint
<dt>Of the dear names that lie concealed within't.
</p>
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>Silence</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There are some qualities--some incorporate things,
<dt>That have a double life, which thus is made
<dt>A type of that twin entity which springs
<dt>From matter and light, evenced in solid and shade.
<dt>There is a two-fold <i>Silence</i>--sea and shore--
<dt>Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
<dt>Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
<dt>Some human memories and tearful lore,
<dt>Render him terrorless: his name's "No More."
<dt>He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
<dt>No power hath he of evil in himself;
<dt>But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
<dt>Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
<dt>That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
<dt>No foot of man) commend thyself to God!
<p>
<a name=400></a><h2>Sonnet--To Zante</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
<dt>Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!
<dt>How many memories of what radiant hours
<dt>At sight of thee and thine at once awake! 
<dt>How many scenes of what departed bliss!
<dt>How many thoughts of what entombed hopes! 
<dt>How many visions of a maiden that is
<dt>No more- no more upon thy verdant slopes! 
<dt>No more! alas, that magical sad sound 
<dt>Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no more--
<dt>Thy memory no more! Accursed ground 
<dt>Henceforth I hold thy flower-enameled shore, 
<dt>O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!
<dt>"Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!"
