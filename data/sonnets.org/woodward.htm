<p>
<dt>The measured lines their imageries reveal,
<dt>And seek with purer thoughts the mind to fill,
<dt>Subdue the passions, and enthrone the will,
<dt>And in the heart some worthier impulse seal.
<dt>To bless the world, its needless cares disperse,
<dt>The poet strives for highest realms of thought;
<dt>His mind aflame, with deep compassion fraught,
<dt>Will write his heart's convictions in his verse.
<dt>His verse oft stirs emotion's deepest springs,
<dt>From anguished souls the crushing pain decoys,
<dt>In cheerless lives hope's sweetest anthem sings,
<dt>And seals in hearts this life's sublimest joys.
<dt>The bard unfolds in song thought's living power,
<dt>Like opening bud reveals the fragrant flower.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Ocean Tomb</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The great Titanic's hosts have gone to greet
<dt>The dead, uncoffined in broad ocean's deep;
<dt>Around their hallowed tombs no mourners weep,
<dt>Nor sorrow's requiem o'er their graves repeat.
<dt>The powers of fate man's feeble plans defeat,
<dt>And rolling billows o'er the helpless sweep,
<dt>And on their dark expanse their harvest reap.
<dt>The rich and poor, their like destructions meet.
<dt>Time soothes the sorrow and the wound will heal,
<dt>The waves will sing to them their rhythmic song;
<dt>May God's own hands their bodies guard and keep,
<dt>And o'er those hallowed waters place his seal.
<dt>To friends, their memories only, now belong,
<dt>In ocean depths they rest and sweetly sleep.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Easter Thoughts</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The sleepless night in awful anguish spent,
<dt>Great crimson drops the holy features steep;
<dt>Those left to watch, in peaceful quiet sleep,
<dt>The howling mob by treacherous priesthood sent
<dt>With swords and staves, by faithless Judas led,
<dt>With vain salute, Hail, Master! And that sign,
<dt>A traitor's kiss--the frightened followers fled
<dt>And murderous demons seize their Lord, divine.
<dt>The priestly court--false witnesses are sought,
<dt>The Roman court--not guilty--yet condemned,
<dt>The cruel cross--a world's redemption bought,
<dt>The quaking earth with awful darkness hemmed;
<dt>The Roman guard--the grave securely sealed,
<dt>The opened tomb--the risen Lord revealed.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>The Book-Lover</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Beneath the spreading limbs of forest bowers,
<dt>Like hermit sage, he seeks sequestered nook;
<dt>A thoughtful youth there hidden with his book,
<dt>Will gather knowledge through the silent hours.
<dt>These garnered stores his hungry mind devours,
<dt>As famished herds drink from the cooling brook.
<dt>Or bees, which naught could tempt to overlook
<dt>The nectared sweetness of the fragrant flowers.
<dt>The sturdy miner delves the earth for gold,
<dt>For wealth the seaman sails to distant shore,
<dt>The farmer toils by ripened grain fields toled,
<dt>And slaving hosts bow at wealth's golden throne;
<dt>The student gleans from fields by others sown,
<dt>And reaps from books their more enduring store.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Spring Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The drear and lonesome season now has gone
<dt>And winter's sadness will be turned to mirth;
<dt>The opening buds and smiling flowers each dawn,
<dt>Will greet with joy this gladder season's birth.
<dt>The earth awakened from the winter's dearth,
<dt>The robin chirps with glee o'er grassy lawn;
<dt>And wilder spots have felt the sunbeam's worth,
<dt>Which charm to gayer pranks the sportive fawn.
<dt>All nature smiles in springtime fashion dressed,
<dt>The fertile fields resound with plowman's song;
<dt>The noisy sparrow builds 'neath eaves her nest,
<dt>The woodland trembles with the warbling throng.
<dt>New life is born, new hope inspires the breast,
<dt>For spring has come and all the world is blest.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Slaves to Fashion</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The French "creator" rules the realm of style,
<dt>With consummate skill lures aping crowds along;
<dt>With gaudy frills their pliant minds beguile,
<dt>And binds in fashion's chains the hapless throng.
<dt>With bated breath they wait the stern command
<dt>Of fashion's priest; whose great creative mind
<dt>Must mold the fashions of this glorious land--
<dt>The vulgar Frenchman clothes the world's refined.
<dt>The rich and poor, the humble and the great,
<dt>Must wear the garb these foreign lords devise;
<dt>They dare not scorn the Frenchman's fashion plate
<dt>But wear the garment, though the style despise.
<dt>The world still yields to style's deforming sway,
<dt>And nature's sweetest charms they fling away.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>The Sign-Writer</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The gilded signs whose silent voices speak,
<dt>Reveal those hands which genius has endowed,
<dt>To check the footsteps of the hurrying crowd,
<dt>And guide, unerring, to the marts they seek.
<dt>Dark, devious paths oft mark the crowded way,
<dt>And dangerous pitfalls there the steps betide;
<dt>The sign-writer's work becomes a trusted guide,
<dt>Where by-baths branch to lead the feet astray.
<dt>Sublime the work through power of genius born,
<dt>Though menial sphere may mark its lowly place;
<dt>Its beauty will earth's highest realms adorn,
<dt>And lowest depths its guiding gleams embrace.
<dt>The genius writes the sign to charm the eyes,
<dt>Still, that he works for gain no one denies.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>Christmas Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The star that marked the birthplace of our King
<dt>Shone bright above that Bethlehem manger bed,
<dt>And by its gleams wise shepherds' feet were led
<dt>To pay him homage, and their treasures bring.
<dt>Now, to this star the world's great nations cling,
<dt>Revere the power that raised him from the dead,
<dt>With wreathes of love still crown that sacred head,
<dt>And waft to heaven the song which angels sing.
<dt>This song of "Peace on earth, good will t'ward men,"
<dt>Has charmed the vistas of earth's noblest thought;
<dt>Still guides the hand that wields immortal pen,
<dt>And crowns him king, who man's redemption bought--
<dt>Whose tireless feet o'er hill and valley's glen,
<dt>From heaven to earth a priceless message brought.
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>Belgium's Triumph</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Those cruel hordes with boastful pomp and pride,
<dt>To please a tyrant's greed and lust for power,
<dt>Would drench in blood a land that will not cower,
<dt>And bathe fair Belgium in war's crimson tide.
<dt>The rights of peaceful powers have been denied,
<dt>Nor woman's prayers nor childhood's tears this hour
<dt>Could stay the hand that would their homes devour,
<dt>And o'er their bleeding forms in triumph ride.
<dt>Faith's prayers ascend, hope's voice to God appeals,
<dt>That love might win against a tyrant's might,
<dt>And heal the wounds this dreadful strife reveals,
<dt>And honor Belgium's stand for peace and right.
<dt>Time will record in blood an empire's shame,
<dt>While Belgium's triumph is an honored name.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>Bald Heads; Outside and In</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Judge not a man by his smooth, shining pate,
<dt>When from his dome time has the covering shorn,
<dt>And left that space like desert plains, forlorn,
<dt>While oft beneath are brains which compensate.
<dt>Think not that hair great sense must indicate,
<dt>That sheltering locks do all wise heads adorn,
<dt>For in his skull man's power to think was born,
<dt>And wisdom's charms oft hairless crowns ornate.
<dt>Skulls void of hair without, and lacking brains,
<dt>When sportive nature works some foolish prank,
<dt>For which misfortune naught could recompense;
<dt>Still without hair, or with, this truth remains,
<dt>That human heads that reach life's highest rank,
<dt>Are those adorned with brains and common sense.
<p>
<a name=110></a><h2>Cruelty of Creeds</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Creeds melted in the fires of modern thought,
<dt>Which truth has kindled into quenchless flame,
<dt>Has in its light revealed the crime and shame,
<dt>Of doctrines superstition's votaries taught.
<dt>Untold the anguish wicked creeds have brought,
<dt>To those who dared a different faith proclaim,
<dt>Where at the stake they earned a martyr's name,
<dt>And crowned a faith with honors, dearly bought.
<dt>Time scarce can heal the wounds of cruel creeds,
<dt>Their crimson stains outlive the flight of years;
<dt>Though martyred saints shall reap immortal meads,
<dt>And Christian truth and love dispel earth's fears,
<dt>No power of man can hide those barbarous deeds,
<dt>Nor wipe from history's page the martyr's tears.
