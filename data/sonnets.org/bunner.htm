<h2><a name="dead"></a>Dead in Bohemia</h2>
<h3>Irwin Russell</h3>
<h4><i>Died in New Orleans, December 1879</i></h4>
<p>
<dt>Small was thy share of all this world's delight
<dt>And scant thy poet's crown of flowers of praise;
<dt>Yet ever catches quaint of quaint old days
<dt>Thou sang'st, and, singing, kept thy spirit bright
<dt>Even as to lips the winds of winter bite
<dt>Some outcast wanderer sets his flute and plays
<dt>Till at his feet blossom the icy ways,
<dt>And from the snowdrift's bitter wasting white
<dt>He hears the uprising carol of the lark,
<dt>Soaring from clover seas with summer ripe--
<dt>While freeze upon his cheek glad, foolish tears.
<dt>Ah! let us hope that somewhere in thy dark,
<dt>Herrick's full note, and Suckling's pleasant pipe,
<dt>Are sounding still their solace in thine ears.

A Poem in the Programme</h2>      
<dt>A thousand fans are fretting the hot air;      
<dt>Soft swells the music of the interlude      
<dt>Above the murmurous hum of talk subdued;      
<dt>But, from the noise withdrawn and from the glare,      
<dt>Deep in the shadowy box your coilèd hair      
<dt>Gleams golden bright, with diamonds bedewed;      
<dt>Your head is bent; I know your dark eyes brood      
<dt>On the poor sheet of paper you hold there,
<p></p>      
<dt>That quotes my verses, and I see no more      
<dt>That bald-head Plutus by your side.&nbsp; The seas      
<dt>Sound in my ears; I hear the rustling pines;      
<dt>Catch the low lisp of billows on the shore      
<dt> Where once I lay in Knickerbockered ease,      
<dt>And read to you those then unprinted lines.&nbsp;

<h2><a name="deaf"></a>Deaf</h2>             
<dt>As to a bird's song she were listening,             
<dt>Her beautiful head is ever sidewise bent;             
<dt>Her questioning eyes lift up their depths intent—             
<dt>She, who will never hear the wild-birds sing.             
<dt>My words within her ears' cold chambers ring             
<dt>Faint, with the city's murmurous sub-tones blent;             
<dt>Though with such sounds as suppliants may have sent             <dt>To high-throned goddesses, my speech takes wing.             
<p></p>
<dt>Not for the side-poised head's appealing grace             
<dt>I gaze, nor hair where fire in shadow lies—             
<dt>For her this world's unhallowed noises base             
<dt>Melt into silence; not our groans, our cries,             
<dt>  Our curses, reach that high-removèd place             
<dt>  Where dwells her spirit, innocently wise.             
<dt>
<h2><a name="counting"></a>From a Counting-House</h2>                    
<dt>   There is an  hour when first the westering sun             
<dt>   Takes on  some forecast faint of future red;             
<dt>   When from  the wings of weariness is shed             
<dt>   A  spell upon us toilers, every one;             
<dt>   The day's  work lags a little, well-nigh done;             
<dt>   Far dusky lofts  through all the close air spread             
<dt>   A smell of  eastern bales; the old clerk's head             
<dt>   Nods by  my side, heavy with dreams begun             
<dt>   In dear dead  days wherein his heart is tombed.             
<dt>   But I  my way to Italy have found;             
<dt>   Or wander  where high stars gleam coldly through             
<dt>   The Alpine  skies; or in some nest perfumed,             
<dt>  With soft Parisian luxury set round,             
<dt>   Held out my arms  and cry "At last!" to you.             
<dt>

<h3>April 26th, 1883</h3>                    
<dt>   Although  a curtain of the salt sea-mist             
<dt>   May   fall  between the actor and our eyes—             
<dt>   Although   he  change for dear and softer skies             
<dt>   These that   the  sun has yet but coyly kissed—             
<dt>   Although the   voice  to which we loved to list             
<dt>   Fail   ere  the thunder of our plaudits dies—             
<dt>   Although   he  parts from us in gracious wise,             
<dt>     With grateful memory left his eulogist—             
<dt>     His best is with us still.             
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His perfect art             
<dt>   Has held   us  'twixt a heart-throb and a tear—             
<dt>     Cheating our souls to passionate belief.             
<dt>   And in   his  greatness we have now some part—             
<dt>   We   have  been courtiers of the crownless Lear,             
<dt>     And partners in Othello's mighty grief.             
<dt>
<h2><a name="redemption"></a>Redemption </h2>                       
<dt>   As to   the  drunkard who at morn doth wake             
<dt>   Are   the  clear waters of the virgin spring             
<dt>   Wherewith he   bathes  his eyes that burn and sting             
<dt>     And his intolerable thirst doth slake,             
<dt>   So is the   thought  of thee to me, who break             
<dt>     One sober moment, sick and shuddering,             
<dt>   From  all my life's unworthiness, to fling             
<dt>   Me at   thy  memory's feet, and for Love's sake             
<dt>   Pray that   thy  peace may enter in my soul.             
<dt>   Love, thou   hast  heart!&nbsp; My veins more calmly flow—             
<dt>   The   madness  of the night is passed away—             
<dt>   Fire   of   false  eyes, thirst of the cursèd bowl—             
<dt>   I   drink  deep of thy purity, and lo!             
<dt>   Thou hast   given me  new heart to meet the day.&nbsp;
