<p>
<dt>Young, beautiful, and learned Jane, intent
<dt>On knowledge, found it peace; her vast acquirement
<dt>Of goodness was her fall; she was content
<dt>With dulcet pleasures, such as calm retirement
<dt>Yields to the wise alone;--her only vice
<dt>Was virtue: in obedience to her sire
<dt>And lord she died, with them a sacrifice
<dt>To their ambition: her own mild desire
<dt>Was rather to be happy than be great;
<dt>For though at their request she claimed the crown,
<dt>That they through her might rise to rule the state,
<dt>Yet the bright diadem and gorgeous throne
<dt>She viewed as cares, dimming the dignity
<dt>Of her unsullied mind and pure benignity.
