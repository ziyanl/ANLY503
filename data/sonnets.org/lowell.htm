<a name=010></a><h2>Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Our love is not a fading earthly flower:
<dt>Its wing&egrave;d seed dropped down from Paradise,
<dt>And, nursed by day and night, by sun and shower,
<dt>Doth momently to fresher beauty rise.
<dt>To us the leafless autumn is not bare,
<dt>Nor winter's rattling boughs lack lusty green:
<dt>Our summer hearts make summer's fulness where
<dt>No leaf or bud or blossom may be seen:
<dt>For nature's life in love's deep life doth lie,
<dt>Love,--whose forgetfulness is beauty's death,
<dt>Whose mystic key these cells of Thou and I
<dt>Into the infinite freedom openeth, 
<dt>And makes the body's dark and narrow grate
<dt>The wide-flung leaves of Heaven's palace-gate.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Love and Sorrow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I thought our love at full, but I did err;
<dt>Joy's wreath drooped o'er mine eyes; I could not see
<dt>That sorrow in our happy world must be
<dt>Love's deepest spokesman and interpreter.
<dt>But, as a mother feels her child first stir
<dt>Under her heart, so felt I instantly
<dt>Deep in my soul another bond to thee
<dt>Thrill with that life we saw depart from her.
<dt>O mother of our angel-child! twice dear!
<dt>Death knits as well as parts, and still, I wis,
<dt>Her tender radiance shall enfold us here;
<dt>Even as the light borne up by inward bliss
<dt>Threads the void glooms of space without a fear,
<dt>To print on farthest stars her pitying kiss.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Street</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>They pass me by like shadows, crowds on crowds,
<dt>Dim ghosts of men that hover to and fro,
<dt>Hugging their bodies round them, like thin shrouds
<dt>Wherein their souls were buried long ago:
<dt>They trampled on their youth, and faith, and love,
<dt>They cast their hope of human-kind away,
<dt>With Heaven's clear messages they madly strove,
<dt>And conquered,--and their spirits turned to clay.
<dt>Lo! how they wander round the world, their grave,
<dt>Whose ever-gaping maw by such is fed,
<dt>Gibbering at living men, and idly rave,
<dt>"We, only, truly live, but ye are dead."
<dt>Alas! poor fools, the anointed eye may trace
<dt>A dead soul's epitaph in every face!

<h3><i>Died September 4, 1874.</i></h3>
<p>
<dt>The wisest man could ask no more of Fate
<dt>Than to be simple, modest, manly, true,
<dt>Safe from the Many, honoured by the Few;
<dt>To count as naught in World, or Church, or State,
<dt>But inwardly in secret to be great;
<dt>To feel mysterious Nature ever new;
<dt>To touch, if not to grasp, her endless clue,
<dt>And learn by each discovery how to wait.
<dt>He widened knowledge and escaped the praise;
<dt>He wisely taught, because more wise to learn;
<dt>He toiled for science, not to draw men's gaze,
<dt>But for her lore of self-denial stern.
<dt>That such a man could spring from our decay
<dt>Fans the soul's nobler faith until it burn.

<a name=050></a><h2>To a Friend</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3><i>Who gave me a group of weeds and grasses, after a drawing of D&uuml;rer.</i></h3>
<p>
<dt>True as the sun's own work, but more refined,
<dt>It tells of love behind the artist's eye,
<dt>Of sweet companionships with earth and sky,
<dt>And summers stored, the sunshine of the mind.
<dt>What peace! Sure, ere you breathe, the fickle wind
<dt>Will break its truce and bend that grass-plume high,
<dt>Scarcely yet quiet from the gilded fly
<dt>That flits a more luxurious perch to find.
<dt>Thanks for a pleasure that can never pall,
<dt>A serene moment, deftly caught and kept
<dt>To make immortal summer on my wall.
<dt>Had he who drew such gladness ever wept?
<dt>Ask rather could he else have seen at all,
<dt>Or grown in Nature's mysteries an adept?
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>To Miss D. T.</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3><i>On her giving me a drawing of little street arabs.</i></h3>
<p>
<dt>As, cleansed of Tiber's and Oblivion's slime,
<dt>Glow Farnesina's vaults with shapes again
<dt>That dreamed some exiled artist from his pain
<dt>Back to his Athens and the Muse's clime,
<dt>So these world-orphaned waifs of Want and Crime,
<dt>Purged by Art's absolution from the stain
<dt>Of the polluting city-flood, regain
<dt>Ideal grace secure from taint of time.
<dt>An Attic frieze you give, a pictured song;
<dt>For as with words the poet paints, for you
<dt>The happy pencil at its labour sings,
<dt>Stealing his privilege, nor does him wrong,
<dt>Beneath the false discovering the true,
<dt>And Beauty's best in unregarded things.
