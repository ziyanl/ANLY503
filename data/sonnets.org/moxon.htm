<dt>The muses weep around their ancient seat;
<dt>The streams of Stowey heave a piteous moan;
<dt>The nightingales he loved sit mute and lone;
<dt>And the sad Lars leave not their dumb retreat.
<dt>The dryads keep within their mossy cells;
<dt>The flowers there open not at morn nor eve;
<dt>The hills re-echo with a thousand knells,
<dt>For he is gone for whom all shepherds grieve.

<dt>He made the sweetest Music of them all,
<dt>And when he sang nor old nor young would stir;
<dt>You could not even hear the waterfall
<dt>While he rehearsed that "Ancient Mariner,"
<dt>Or told in accents that like manna fell
<dt>The wild and wondrous tale of Christabel!
