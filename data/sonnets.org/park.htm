<p>
<dt>Fair was the face of this illumined dawn,
<dt>With vernal brightness, vernal softness fair,
<dt>The sun incessant wooed the blushing morn
<dt>And all the youthful hours laughed round the pair:
<dt>But ere the evening, what a change was there!
<dt>Harsh thunders roll and fork~ lightnings fly;
<dt>Hiemal tempests brood along the air
<dt>Or fall in torrents from an angry sky.
<p>
<dt>Ah! scarce less mutable is man's brief day;
<dt>Soon are his early prospects clouded o'er,
<dt>And those soft suns that shot their April ray
<dt>Across his primrose pathway shine no more:
<dt>Grief on the present drops her tearful showers,
<dt>And apprehension over the future lours.

<p>
<dt>Romantic guardians of this peaceful vale,
<dt>That over yon raftered shed raise high your brow:
<dt>Say, does some wizard up your cleft side scale
<dt>And like a blighted pollard seem to grow?
<dt>Wrapped in the mazy windings of the dale,
<dt>Do elfin monarchs hold their court below,
<dt>Or down the devious rill by moonlight sail,
<dt>Their bark a shell, a grassy blade their prow?
<p>
<dt>Whate'er your residents, whate'er their task,
<dt>To shield the sounding cliff or springs unlock,
<dt>Whether they now in sloping sunbeams bask,
<dt>Or doze till midnight in the rifted rock;
<dt>Still let a stranger mark their hallowed reign
<dt>And hear in rising winds their mystic strain.

<p>
<dt>If to be praised by those who merit praise
<dt>Gives honour, as some sapient sages deemed;
<dt>If by the bland in heart to be esteemed
<dt>Gives comfort, and the drooping thought can raise;
<dt>If, where the dignity of elder days
<dt>And high nobility of souls have beamed
<dt>An inborn radiance, sympathy hath gleamed
<dt>With kindred warmth, and shot some roseate rays,
<dt>And with benignant tenderness hath cheered
<dt>My lonesome hours, whom widowed anguish led
<dt>Through sorrow's sablest gloom; how much endeared
<dt>Is Brydges! by each muse and grace bestead;
<dt>For he, my lettered friend, my social pride,
<dt>Hath honour, comfort, solace, joy supplied.
