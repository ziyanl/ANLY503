<h2>Jesus Wept</h2>
<P>
<dt>Mary rose up, as one in sleep might rise,
<dt>And went to meet her brother's Friend: and they
<dt>Who tarried with her said: "she goes to pray
<dt>And weep where her dead brother's body lies."
<dt>So, with their wringing of hands and with sighs,
<dt>They stood before Him in the public way.
<dt>"Had'st Thou been with him, Lord, upon that day,
<dt>He had not died," she said, drooping her eyes.
<dt>Mary and Martha with bowed faces kept
<dt>Holding His garments, one on each side.--"Where
<dt>Have ye laid him?" He asked. "Lord, come and see."--
<dt>The sound of grieving voices heavily
<dt>And universally was round Him there,
<dt>A sound that smote His spirit. Jesus wept.
