"The late Mr. Edward Noel was one of those men who impress one more by their personality than by anything written. He was a man of true and liberal culture, with a temperament at once romantic and reserved, and with a nature so essentially noble and beautiful that no one could know him without gaining greatly thereby. His memory is a treasured possession with the fortunate few who had his friendship. Until after his death, few, if any, of his friends knew that he had written anything, though a year or two previous he did let fall some hint to me of his poetic work. After his death, Miss Noel published (Eliot Stock, 1884) his collected <i>Poems</i>. They are characterised by deep meditative beauty--not underivative as regards expression, it is true--and a sad yet not despairing melancholy, the result of the great loss Mr Noel sustained in the death of his dearly loved wife, which occurred during his long residence in Greece."

<p>
<dt>The raindrops shimmered down the beamy sky:
<dt>"<i>Behold</i>," one sang, "<i>how gloriously bright</i>
<dt><i>The golden garments of the King of light!</i>"--
<dt>"<i>Golden! O drop, a beam is in thine eye!"</i>
<dt>A second cries: "<i>His robe's of crimson dye.</i>"--
<dt>"<i>Ye both are blind</i>," another shouts: "<i>my sight</i>
<dt><i>Is clear, and with the purple veil of night</i>
<dt><i>Our monarch is arrayed in mystery.</i>
<p>
<dt>Thus wrangling, shouting, hopeless to agree
<dt>The drops shot swiftly down the headlong steep,
<dt>Until at last they fell into the sea.
<dt>When they arose from out the cold, dark deep,
<dt>The sun sat throned in stainless majesty,
<dt>While down a cloud they saw the rainbow sweep.
