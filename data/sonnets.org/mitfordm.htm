<p>
<dt>Fair art thou, Scotia. The swift mountain stream
<dt>Gushes, with deafening roar and whitening spray,
<dt>From thy brown hills; where eagles seek their prey,
<dt>Or soar undazzled in the solar beam.
<dt>But dearer far to me, be thou my theme,
<dt>My native Hampshire! Thy sweet valleys gay,
<dt>Trees, spires, and cots that in the brilliant ray
<dt>Confusedly glitter like a morning dream.
<p>
<dt>And thou, fair forest! lovely are thy shades,
<dt>Thy oaks majestic, over the billows pale,
<dt>High spreading their green arms: or the deep glades,
<dt>Where the dark holly, armed in prickly mail,
<dt>Shelters the yellow fern, and tufted blades
<dt>That wave responsive to the sighing gale.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>A Canzonet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As in the bursting springtime over the eye
<dt>Of one who haunts the fields fair visions creep
<dt>Beneath the clos&eacute;d lids (afore dull sleep
<dt>Dims the quick fancy) of sweet flowers that lie
<dt>On grassy banks, oxlip of orient dye,
<dt>And palest primrose and blue violet,
<dt>All in their fresh and dewy beauty set,
<dt>Pictured within the sense, and will not fly;
<p>
<dt>So in mine ear resounds and lives again
<dt>One mingled melody,--a voice, a pair
<dt>Of instruments most voice-like! Of the air
<dt>Rather than of the earth seems that high strain,
<dt>A spirit's song, and worthy of the train
<dt>That soothed old Prospero with music rare.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Singing</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I could have lengthened out one fleeting hour
<dt>Into an age--sitting at set of sun
<dt>Under the long low open shed, where won
<dt>The mellow evening light through leaf and flower;
<dt>Playing the hostess in that summer bower
<dt>To such dear guests, whilst rose the antique song,
<dt>By those young sister voices poured along,
<dt>So wild, so pure, so clear, full of sweet power,
<dt>Ringing and vibrating.
<dt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a lay
<dt>That sent a smile into the very heart:
<dt>As when the early lark shoots up in May
<dt>With his blithe matins, rarer than all art
<dt>Save this. O happiest and most fleeting day,
<dt>Why art thou gone so soon?--Why must we part?
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Grasshopper and Cricket</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How oft, amid the heaped and bedded hay,
<dt>Under the oak's broad shadow deep and strong,
<dt>Have we sat listening to the noon-day song
<dt>(If song it were), monotonously gay,
<dt>Which crept along the field, the summer lay
<dt>Of the grasshopper. Summer is come in pride
<dt>Of fruit and flower, garlanded as a bride,
<dt>And crowned with corn, and graced with length of day:
<dt>But cold is come with her.
<dt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We sit not now
<dt>Listening that merry music of the earth,
<dt>Like Arid beneath the blossomed bough;
<dt>But all for chillness round the social hearth
<dt>We cluster.--Hark! a sound of kindred mirth
<dt>Echoes! O wintry cricket, welcome thou!

<p>
<dt>Sleep on, my mother! sweet and innocent dreams
<dt>Attend thee, best and dearest! Dreams that gild
<dt>Life's clouds like setting suns, with pleasures filled
<dt>And saintly joy, such as thy mind beseems,
<dt>Thy mind where never stormy passion gleams,
<dt>Where their soft nest the dove-like virtues build;
<dt>And calmest thoughts, like violets distilled,
<dt>Their fragrance mingle with bright wisdom's beams.
<p>
<dt>Sleep on, my mother! not the lily's bell
<dt>So sweet; not the enamoured west-wind's sighs
<dt>That shake the dew-drop from her snowy cell
<dt>So gentle; not that dew-drop ere it flies
<dt>So pure. Even slumber loves with thee to dwell,
<dt>O model most beloved of good and wise.
