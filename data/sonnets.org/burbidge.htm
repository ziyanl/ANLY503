<p>
<dt>Speak it no more--no more with words profane
<dt>What only for the language of the eye
<dt>Is fit--what only can be told thereby!
<dt>The heart has tones which words cannot contain,
<dt>And feelings which to speak is to restrain.
<dt>Like scent with scent commixed invisibly,
<dt>Or rays of neighbour planets in the sky
<dt>Inter-confused; or, as in some deep strain
<dt>Of music, heavenly passion is combined
<dt>With thought, and tone with tone in harmony,
<dt>Thus be the meeting of our hearts, dear love!
<dt>The pure communion of mind with mind,
<dt>Above poor symbols of this earth,--above
<dt>All that can baulk or cramp,--can change or die.
