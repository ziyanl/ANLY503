<a name=010></a><h2>The Poet's House</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Where should the Poet's house and household be?
<dt>Beneath what skies, in what untroubled air
<dt>Sings he for very joy of songs so fair
<dt>That in their steadfast laws he most is free?
<dt>In woods remote, where darkly tree on tree
<dt>Let fall their curtained shadows, to ensnare
<dt>His dreams, or hid in Fancy's happiest lair,--
<dt>Some laughing island of the stormless sea?
<dt>Ah, never such to him their welcome gave!
<dt>But, flattered by the gods in finer scorn,
<dt>He drifts upon the world's unresting wave,
<dt>As drifts a sea-flower, by the tempest torn
<dt>From sheltered porches of the coral cave
<dt>Where it expands, of calm and silence born.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>In Absence</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Absence from thee is something worse than death;
<dt>For, to the heart that slumbers in the shroud,
<dt>What are the mourners' tears and clamours loud,
<dt>The open grave, the dismal cypress wreath?
<dt>The quiet body misses not its breath;
<dt>The pain that shivers through the weeping crowd
<dt>Is idle homage to the visage proud
<dt>That changeth not for all Affliction saith.
<dt>But to be thus from thee so far away,
<dt>Is as though I, in seeming death, might be
<dt>Conscious of all that passed about my clay;
<dt>As though I saw my doleful obsequy,
<dt>Mourned my own loss, rebelled against decay,
<dt>And felt thy tear-drops trickling over me.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>From the North</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Once more without you!  Sighing, dear, once more,
<dt>For all the sweet, accustomed ministries
<dt>Of wife and mother; not as when the seas
<dt>That parted us my tender message bore
<dt>From the gray olives of the Cretan shore
<dt>To those that hide the broken Phidian frieze
<dt>Of our Athenian home,--but far degrees,
<dt>Wide plains, great forests, part us now.  My door
<dt>Looks on the rushing Neva, cold and clear:
<dt>The swelling domes in hovering splendour lie
<dt>Like golden bubbles, eager to be gone;
<dt>But the chill crystal of the atmosphere
<dt>Withholds them, and along the northern sky
<dt>The amber midnight smiles in dreams of dawn.
