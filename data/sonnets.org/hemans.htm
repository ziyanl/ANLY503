<a name=100></a><h2>Flight of the Spirit</h2>
<P>
<dt>Whither, oh! whither wilt thou wing thy way?
<dt>What solemn region first upon thy sight
<dt>Shall break, unveiled for terror or delight?
<dt>What hosts, magificent in dread array,
<dt>My spirit! when thy prison-house of clay
<dt>After long strife is rent? Fond, fruitless quest!
<dt>The unfledged bird, within his narrow nest,
<dt>Sees but a few green branches oer him play,
<dt>And through their parting leaves, by fits revealed,
<dt>A glimpse of summer sky; nor knows the field
<dt>Wherein his dormant powers must yet be tried.
<dt>Thou art that bird!--of what beyond thee lies
<dt>Far in the untracked immeasurable skies
<dt>Knowing but this--that thou shalt find thy guide!
</P>
<a name=200></a><h2>Sabbath Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>How many blessed groups this hour are bending,
<dt>Through England's primrose meadow-paths, their way
<dt>Towards spire and tower, 'midst shadowy elms ascending,
<dt>Whence the sweet chimes proclaim the hallowed day!
<dt>The halls from old heroic ages gray
<dt>Pour their fair children forth; and hamlets low,
<dt>With those thick orchard-blooms the soft winds play,
<dt>Send out their inmates in a happy flow,
<dt>Like a freed vernal stream. I may not tread
<dt>With them those pathways, to the feverish bed
<dt>Of sickness bound; yet, O my God! I bless
<dt>Thy mercy, that with Sabbath peace hath filled 
<dt>My chastened heart, and all its throbbings stilled
<dt>To one deep calm of lowliest thankfulness.
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>Design and Performance</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>They float before my soul, the fair designs
<dt>Which I would body forth to life and power,
<dt>Like clouds that with their wavering hues and lines
<dt>Portray majestic building--dome and tower,
<dt>Bright spire, that through the rainbow and the shower
<dt>Points to the unchanging stars; and high arcade,
<dt>Far-sweeping to some glorious altar made
<dt>For holiest rites.
<dt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile the waning hour
<dt>Melts from me, and by fervent dreams overwrought
<dt>I sink. O friend! O linked with each high thought!
<dt>Aid me, of those rich visions to detain
<dt>All I may grasp; until thou seest fulfilled,
<dt>While time and strength allow, my hope to build
<dt>For lowly hearts devout, but <i>one</i> enduring fane!
<p>
