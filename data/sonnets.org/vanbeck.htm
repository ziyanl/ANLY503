<a name=010></a><h2>In Zululand</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Morning in Zululand. I was awake
<dt>Ere yet the sun the voiceless hill-tops kissed.
<dt>Far in the distance, like a fog-dimmed lake,
<dt>The bosom of a mountain, with the mist
<dt>Hanging above it; on its highest hold,
<dt>A ruin, grand in famished wilderness,
<dt>Like some romantic castle tower of old,
<dt>Blue, solitary, silent, tenantless.
<dt>Now decks the sun the Eastern sky with gold,
<dt>Now with a golden diadem has crowned
<dt>The stately turret; awe-rapt, I behold
<dt>His gilded rays the silver mist confound,
<dt>With longings undefined, yet past control,
<dt>In silent meditation of the soul.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Out of the Mist-land</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Out of the mist-land of the Past come back,
<dt>And hold my hand in silence, smile on me
<dt>Just once to cheer me on the lonely track
<dt>That leads from sorrow to uncertainty.
<dt>Where art thou now? Ah, love, how can I say,
<dt>Perchance in some far world I may not see.
<dt>As many ocean waves have rolled away
<dt>As all the years that hide thee far from me.
<dt>Yet I have known thee once full long ago,
<dt>The evening winds bring echoes of our love,
<dt>The twilight-drooping flowers do tell me so,
<dt>And the imagined murmuring above.
<dt>And to my spirit thou art ever real,
<dt>Who wert, and art, and shalt be mine ideal.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>In Exile</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As these far-reaching sands my life is drear
<dt>And mournful as the murmur of the deep
<dt>And changeless ocean. But they come in sleep,
<dt>My loving kinsmen from afar, and bear
<dt>To kindly sleep's dream-laden atmosphere
<dt>A fond illusion for my heart to keep
<dt>Like a rich boat gale-blown when tides are neap,
<dt>Afraid to lose it, holding it so dear.
<p>
<dt>'Tis then she comes, and with love-radiant eyes,
<dt>And with a little cry she leans on me,
<dt>And for a moment all my soul swings free--
<dt>Swings free to journey back life's listless stream.
<dt>But all too soon, alas, the slumber dies
<dt>Of one who longs for an eternal dream.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Farewell, My Lady</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Farewell, my lady, and bright star, good-bye!
<dt>My soul would find its immortality,
<dt>My love, uncrown&eacute;d, on death's wings would fly
<dt>To seek its laurel in Eternity.
<dt>Hope softly falls from gardens of the sky,
<dt>Whose soil is darkness, and whose blossoms light,
<dt>Falls softly in the murmured melody,
<dt>Borne earthward by the dewy winds of night.
<dt>O winds, that in the kingdom of yon mist
<dt>Sing to the flowers and all their secrets bear,
<dt>Inform my heart, now while the world is kissed
<dt>To listless silence, dwells contentment there?
<dt>Do loving dreams inhabit That Domain,
<dt>Where I would end this flight to dream again?
