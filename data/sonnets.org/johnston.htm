<a name=010></a><h2>General Gordon</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The marks of death were on him, and he bore
<dt>In every feature that sharp, clear, cold look
<dt>Which is not of this world; his weak frame shook,
<dt>Yet not with terror shook; for oft before
<dt>He had sought death amid the battle's roar;
<dt>Nor shrank he now, when in his chamber lone
<dt>Death, visible death, for three long moons had shown
<dt>His dart upraised, but struck not; still he wore
<dt>His brow, though sad, undaunted; for he knew
<dt>This was his last great fight, whose promise high
<dt>Was endless glory to the faithful few,
<dt>Whose courage can endure to victory.
<dt>And so he conquered, and a soldier true
<dt>And gallant, as he lived, did Gordon die.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Revenge</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Spirit of evil, with which earth is rife,
<dt>Revenge, revenge! thee all abjure and blame,
<dt>Yet when their hour is come invoke thy name;
<dt>Base men for thee in secret bare the knife;
<dt>The brave partake the peril and the strife;
<dt>The weak, the sword more sure of justice claim;
<dt>The strong, when they have blasted power and fame,
<dt>Give to their foe in scorn the curse of life,
<dt>The keenest, bitterest vengeance--
<dt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;for these all
<dt>Are only shapes thou takest to goad the mind,
<dt>Turning the heart's pure generous blood to gall;
<dt>And thus, revenge, thou stalkst through all the kind
<dt>Till mighty nations madden at thy call,
<dt>And earth is waste and seas incarnadined.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>In Decline</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I've seen my day before its noon decline,
<dt>And dark is still the future, nor alas!
<dt>Can hope with all the magic of her glass
<dt>Irradiate the deep gloom which fate malign
<dt>Has gathered round; yet will I not repine;
<dt>For though the courage that can do and dare
<dt>Be brightest glory, unsubdued to bear,
<dt>That calmer, better virtue may be mine;
<p>
<dt>For this is of the mind; to slay, be slain
<dt>Asks but a moment's energies, and fame
<dt>First wakens and then keeps alive the flame;
<dt>But patience must itself, itself sustain,
<dt>And must itself reward, nor hope to find
<dt>The praise or the compassion of mankind.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>To ------</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Whether thy locks in natural beauty stray
<dt>Clustering like woodbind wild, or haply bound
<dt>Like ivy wreath thy polished brows around;
<dt>Whether within thine eyes' blue mirror play
<dt>Mirth's arrowy beams or love's more softened ray;
<dt>Whether to the gay viol's pleasant sound
<dt>Thou minglest in the dance's airy round,
<dt>Thy light feet twinkling like the darts of day;
<dt>Or whether over the graceful harp thy frame,
<dt>More graceful yet, with eyes up-raised thou bendest,
<dt>And with its tones thy own, far sweeter, blendest;
<dt>Still thou art loveliest, varying, yet the same,
<dt>Still over my soul thine absolute sway extendest,
<dt>And from all other loves thy heart defendest.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Fidelity</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There is a virtue, which to Fortune's height
<dt>Follows us not, but in the vale below,
<dt>Where dwell the ills of life, disease and woe,
<dt>Holds on its steady course, serenely bright.
<dt>So some lone star, whose softly beaming light
<dt>We mark not in the blaze of solar day,
<dt>Comes forth with pure and ever constant ray,
<dt>That makes even beautiful the gloom of night.
<p>
<dt>Thou art that star so lovely and so lone,
<dt>That virtue of distress--Fidelity!
<dt>And thou, when every joy and hope are flown,
<dt>Clingst to the relics of humanity,
<dt>Making with all its sorrows life still dear,
<dt>And death, with all its terrors, void of fear.
