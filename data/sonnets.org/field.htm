<p>
<dt>There shall be beds full of light odours blent,
<dt>Divans, great couches, deep, profound as tombs,
<dt>And frown for us, in light magnificent,
<dt>Over the flower-stand there shall droop strange blooms.
<p>
<dt>Careful of their last flame declining,
<dt>As two vast torches our two hearts shall flare,
<dt>And our two spirits in their double shining
<dt>Reflect the double lights enchanted there.
<p>
<dt>One night--A night of mystic blue, of rose,
<dt>A look will pass supreme from me, from you,
<dt>Like a long sob, laden with long adieux.
<p>
<dt>And, later on, an angel will unclose
<dt>The door, and, entering joyously, re-light
<dt>The tarnished mirrors and the flames blown to the night.

<p>
<dt>Within his eyes are hung lamps of the sanctuary:
<dt>A wind, from whence none knows, can set in sway
<dt>And spill their light by fits; but yet their ray
<dt>Returns, deep-boled, to its obscurity.
<p>
<dt>The world as from a dullard turns annoyed
<dt>To stir the days with show or deeds or voices;
<dt>But if one spies him justly one rejoices,
<dt>With silence that the careful lips avoid.
<p>
<dt>He is a plan, a work of some strange passion
<dt>Life has conceived apart from Time's harsh drill,
<dt>A thing it hides and cherishes to fashion.
<p>
<dt>At odd bright moments to its secret will:
<dt>Holy and foolish, ever set apart,
<dt>He waits the leisure of his god's free heart.

<p>
<dt>The lethargy of evil in her eyes--
<dt>As blue snow is the substance of a mere
<dt>Where the dead waters of a glacier drear
<dt>Stand open and behold--a viper lies.
<p>
<dt>Brooding upon her hatreds: dying thus
<dt>Wounded and broken, helpless with her fangs,
<dt>She dies of her sealed curse, yea, of her pangs
<dt>At God's first ban that made her infamous.
<p>
<dt>Yet, by that old curse frozen in her wreath,
<dt>She, like a star, hath central gravity
<dt>That draws and fascinates the soul to death;
<p>
<dt>While round her stark and terrible repose,
<dt>Vaults for its hour a glittering sapphire fly,
<dt>Mocking the charm of death. O God, it knows!
