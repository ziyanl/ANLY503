<dt>There is a soul above the soul of each,
<dt>A mightier soul, which yet to each belongs:
<dt>There is a sound made of all human speech,
<dt>And numerous as the concourse of all songs:
<dt>And in that soul lives each, in each that soul,
<dt>Though all the ages are its lifetime vast;
<dt>Each soul that dies, in its most sacred whole
<dt>Receiveth life that shall for ever last.
<dt>And thus for ever with a wider span
<dt>Humanity o'erarches time and death;
<dt>Man can elect the universal man,
<dt>And live in life that ends not with his breath:
<dt>And gather glory that increases still
<dt>Till Time his glass with Death's last dust shall fill.
