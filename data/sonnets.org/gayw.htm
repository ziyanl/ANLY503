<h3>(With some Verses)</h3>
<p>
<dt>If in the summer of thy bright regard
<dt>For one brief season these poor Rhymes shall live
<dt>I ask no more, nor think my fate too hard
<dt>If other eyes but wintry looks should give;
<dt>Nor will I grieve though what I here have writ
<dt>O'erburdened Time should drop among the ways,
<dt>And to the unremembering dust commit
<dt>Beyond the praise and blame of other days:
<dt>The song doth pass, but I who sing, remain,
<dt>I pluck from Death's own heart a life more deep,
<dt>And as the Spring, that dies not, in her train
<dt>Doth scatter blossoms for the winds to reap,
<dt>So I, immortal, as I fare along,
<dt>Will strew my path with mortal flowers of song.

<p>
<dt>O steep and rugged Life, whose harsh ascent
<dt>Slopes blindly upward through the bitter night!
<dt>They say that on thy summit, high in light,
<dt>Sweet rest awaits the climber, travel-spent;
<dt>But I, alas, with dusty garments rent,
<dt>With fainting heart and failing limbs and sight,
<dt>Can see no glimmer of the shining height,
<dt>And vainly list, with body forward bent,
<dt>To catch athwart the gloom one wandering note
<dt>Of those glad anthems which (they say) are sung
<dt>When one emerges from the mists below:
<dt>But though, O Life, thy summit be remote
<dt>And all thy stony path with darkness hung,
<dt>Yet ever upward through the night I go.
