Sonnets from <i>Sorrows. Sacred to the Memory of Penelope by Sir Brooke Boothby</i> (1796)
<p>Boothby never got over the loss of his only child Penelope in Spring 1791. As he wrote in Sonnet XIII:  
<blockquote><dt>Her faded form now glides before my view; her plaintive voice now floats upon the gale.  The hope how vain, that time should bring relief! Time does but deeper root a real grief.</blockquote>
<p>He neglected his estates, got into financial difficulties and wandered aimlessly in genteel poverty on the continent.  He died in Boulogne, France,  13th Feb. 1824.

<p>
<dt>Bright crisp&eacute;d threads of pure translucent gold!
<dt>Ye who were wont with zephyr's breath to play,
<dt>Over the warm cheek and ivory forehead stray,
<dt>Or clasp her neck in many an amorous fold,
<dt>Now, motionless, in this little shrine must hold:
<dt>No more to wanton in the eye of day;
<dt>Or to the breeze your changeful hues display:
<dt>For ever still inanimate, and cold.
<p>
<dt>Poor, poor last relic of an angel's face!
<dt>Sad setting ray;--no more thy orb is seen!
<dt>O beauty's pattern, miracle of grace;
<dt>Must this be all that tells what thou hast been!--
<dt>Come then, cold crystal, on this bosom lie
<dt>Till love and grief and fond remembrance die!
<p>
<a name=001></a><h2>Sonnet I</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Life's summer flown, the wint'ry tempest rude,
<dt>Began to lower on the declining year;
<dt>When smiles celestial gilt the prospect drear,
<dt>Dispell'd the gloom, and joyful spring renew'd:
<dt>Fresh flowers beneath her fairy feet were strew'd;
<dt>Again soft accents woo'd the enchanted ear;
<dt>In her bright form, as in a mirrour clear,
<dt>Reflected, each gay scene of life view'd.
<dt>Young in her youth, and graceful in her grace,
<dt>In her's, I lived o'er every joy again;
<dt>Lived o'er the charms that beam'd upon her face,
<dt>Where Hope and Love revived their smiling train.
<dt>Night o'er the scene her blackest veil has spread;
<dt>And Death's pale hand a tenfold horrour shed.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Why died I not before that fatal morn,
<dt>That thunder'd in mine ears, "Thy Child is gone;
<dt>"Thy Joys are fled to Heaven; thy hope is done;
<dt>"And thy few days to come are all forlorn!"
<dt>Why, when the stroke, too heavy to be borne,
<dt>Had smote affrighted Reason from her throne,
<dt>And life's chill power suspended; why, too soon,
<dt>Did the warm current to its course return!
<dt>Twice twenty summer suns had roll'd away,
<dt>And seen my hours a clear smooth surface flow;
<dt>Prepared already nature's debt to pay;
<dt>Scarce would my head have shrunk beneath the blow.
<dt>Why now, in misery, do I lingering stay,
<dt>While happiness foregone but mocks my woe?
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>Sonnet III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Did I not weep for him that was in pain!
<dt>Was not my hand still open to distress!
<dt>When did my harden'd heart the weak oppress,
<dt>Or Misery tell her plaintive tale in vain!
<dt>Did ever crime this bleeding bosom stain,
<dt>Or injured sufferer claim unpaid redress!
<dt>Envy, or hate, or pride, my soul possess;
<dt>O wounded truth of broken laws complain!
<dt>Fate to my humble hopes one blessing gave,
<dt>And no new gift my grateful breast required;
<dt><i>"O Heaven! The object of my love but save!"</i>
<dt>Was the sole boon my pious prayers desired:
<dt>Why then has angry Heaven, atone dire blow,
<dt>For ever laid my sorrowing head so low?
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>Sonnet V</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Death! Thy cold hand the brightest flower has chill'd,
<dt>That e'er suffused love's cheek with rosy dies;
<dt>Quench'd the soft radiance of the loveliest eyes,
<dt>And accents tuned to sweetest music still'd;
<dt>The springing buds of hope and pleasure kill'd;
<dt>Joy's cheerful measures changed to doleful sighs;
<dt>Of fairest form, and fairest mind the ties
<dt>For ever rent in twain--So Heaven has will'd!
<dt>Though in the bloom of health, thy arrow fled, 
<dt>Sudden as sure;  long had prophetic dread
<dt>Hung o'er my heart, and all my thoughts depress'd.
<dt>Oft when in flowery wreaths I saw her dress'd,
<dt>A beauteous victim seemed to meet my eyes,
<dt>To early fate a destined sacrifice.
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>Sonnet VI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What art thou, Life? The shadow of a dream:
<dt>The past and future dwell in thought alone;
<dt>The present, ere we note its flight, is gone;
<dt>And all ideal, vain, fantastick, seem.
<dt>Whence is thy source! And whither dost thou tend!
<dt>So short thy period, and thy form so frail;
<dt>Poor prisoner! pent in Death's surrounding vale,
<dt>Born but to breathe, to suffer, and to end.
<dt>Why, Shadow, bring'st thou on thy raven wing
<dt>Dark trains of grief, and visions of the night,
<dt>Rather than graces, robed in purple light,
<dt>Elysian flowers, and love's unclouded spring;
<dt>Since sad, or gay, whatever be thy theme,
<dt>Death surely ends at once the dreamer and the dream!

<a name=012></a>". . . In a highly interesting and pathetic volume of elegiac poetry, written by Sir Brooke Boothby (and published in London by Cadell and Davies, 1796), entitled <i>Sorrows Sacred to the Memory of Penelope</i>, is contained a fine engraving of the exquisite recumbent figure by Banks in Ashbourne Church, referred to by your correspondent. Perhaps you will afford room for the quotation of the following sonnet (<i>Sorrows</i>, p. 18.), which may interest readers unacquainted with the volume:" (from <a href="http://erl.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&seq=1&size=1&id=nq.1852.5.15.5.133.x.476">Notes and Queries</a>, May 15, 1852)

<h2>Sonnet XII</h2>
<p>
<dt>Well has thy classick chisel, Banks*, express'd
<dt>The graceful lineaments of that fine form,
<dt>Which late with conscious, living beauty warm,
<dt>Now here beneath does in dread silence rest.
<dt>And, oh, while life shall agitate my breast,
<dt>Recorded there exists her every charm,
<dt>In vivid colours, safe from change or harm,
<dt>Till my last sigh unalter'd love attest.
<dt>That form, as fair as ever fancy drew,
<dt>The marble cold, inanimate, retains;
<dt>But of the radiant smile that round her threw
<dt>Joys, that beguiled my soul of mortal pains,
<dt>And each divine expression's varying hue,
<dt>A little senseless dust alone remains.
<p>*The reference is to Neoclassical sculptor Thomas Banks, who carved Penelope Boothby's sarcophagus in St. Oswald's Church, Ashbourne, Derbyshire.

<p>
<dt>Dear Mansergh! Of the few this breast who share, 
<dt>And share in pitying sympathy its woe, 
<dt>You best my vast excess of passion know,
<dt>And all the sorrow I am doom'd to bear, 
<dt>While thoughts can present with the past compare.
<dt>Shall memory e'er that summer-day forego,
<dt>When thy fair Mate did every care bestow,
<dt>And vermeil fruits and fragrant wreaths prepare,
<dt>In honour of my Child, to dress the bower!
<dt>And when the sweet epitome of grace
<dt>Tripp'd o'er the walks, and honied every flower,
<dt>You mark'd the opening beauties of her face;
<dt>Mark'd how my captured soul was lost in love,
<dt>And trembled for the dire reverse I prove.
