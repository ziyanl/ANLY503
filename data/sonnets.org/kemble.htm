<p>
<dt>Cover me with your everlasting arms,--
<dt>Ye guardian giants of this solitude!--
<dt>From the ill-sight of men, and from the rude
<dt>Tumultuous din of yon wild world's alarms!
<dt>Oh, knit your mighty limbs around, above,
<dt>And close me in for ever! let me dwell
<dt>With the wood spirits, in the darkest spell
<dt>That ever with your verdant locks ye wove.
<p>
<dt>The air is full of countless voices, joined
<dt>In one eternal hymn; the whispering wind,
<dt>The shuddering leaves, the hidden water springs,
<dt>The work-song of the bees, whose honeyed wings
<dt>Hang in the golden tresses of the lime,
<dt>Or buried lie in purple beds of thyme.

<p>
<dt>There's not a fibre in my trembling frame
<dt>That does not vibrate when thy step draws near,
<dt>There's not a pulse that throbs not when I hear
<dt>Thy voice, thy breathing, nay thy very name.
<dt>When thou art with me every sense seems dim,
<dt>And all I am, or know, or feel is thee;
<dt>My soul grows faint, my veins run liquid flame,
<dt>And my bewildered spirit seems to swim
<dt>In eddying whirls of passion, dizzily.
<p>
<dt>When thou art gone, there creeps into my heart
<dt>A cold and bitter consciousness of pain:
<dt>The light, the warmth of life with thee depart,
<dt>And I sit dreaming over and over again
<dt>Thy greeting clasp, thy parting look and tone;
<dt>And suddenly I wake--and am alone.

<p>
<dt>Lady, whom my belov&eacute;d loves so well!
<dt>When on his clasping arm thy head reclineth,
<dt>When on thy lips his ardent kisses dwell,
<dt>And the bright flood of burning light that shineth
<dt>In his dark eyes, is poured into thine;
<dt>When thou shalt lie enfolded to his heart
<dt>In all the trusting helplessness of love;
<dt>If in such joy sorrow can find a part,
<dt>Oh, give one sigh unto a doom like mine!
<dt>Which I would have thee pity, but not prove.
<dt>One cold, calm, careless, wintry look that fell
<dt>Haply by chance on one, is all that he
<dt>Ever gave my love; round that, my wild thoughts dwell
<dt>In one eternal pang of memory.
