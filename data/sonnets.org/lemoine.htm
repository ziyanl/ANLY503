<dt>A link-boy once, Dick Hellfinch, stood the grin,
<dt>At Charing Cross he long his bawling plied;
<dt>"Here light, here light, your honour, for a win,"
<dt>To every cull and drab he loudly cried.
<dt>In Leicester Fields, as most his story know,
<dt>"Come black your worship for a single mag";
<dt>And while he shined, his Nelly sacked the bag
<dt>And thus they sometimes stagged a precious go;
<dt>In Smithfields too, where graziers oft resort,
<dt>Dick loitered there to take in men of cash,
<dt>With cards and dice was up to every sport
<dt>And at Salt Petre Bank would cut a dash;
<dt>At every knowing rig in every gang,
<dt>Dick Hellfinch was the pink of all the slang.
