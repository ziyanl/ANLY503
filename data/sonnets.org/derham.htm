<p>
<dt>The Soul, of late a lovely sleeping child,
<dt>Spreads sudden wings and stands in radiant guise,
<dt>Eyed like the morn and bent upon the skies;
<dt>Her the blue gulf dismays not, nor the wild
<dt>Horizons with the wrecks of thunder piled;
<dt>Storm has she known, and how its murmur dies
<dt>Starlike through stainless heavens she would rise
<dt>And be no more with cloudy dreams beguiled.
<dt>Was sleep not sweet?--sweet till on sleeping ears
<dt>Earth's voices broke in discord. Now she hears
<dt>Far, far away diviner music move;
<dt>Nor shall her wing be sated of its flight,
<dt>Nor shall her eyes be weary of the night,
<dt>While round her sweep the singing stars of Love.
<p>

<p>
<dt>When the impatient spirit leaves behind
<dt>The clogging hours and makes no dear delay
<dt>To drop this Nessus-shirt of night and day,
<dt>To cast the flesh that bound and could not bind
<dt>The heart untamable, the tireless mind,
<dt>In equal dissolution shall the clay
<dt>That once was seer or singer flee away--
<dt>It shall be fire and blown upon the wind.
<dt>Not us befits such change in radiance dressed,
<dt>Not us, O Earth, for whom thou biddest cease
<dt>Our grey endurance of the dark and cold.
<dt>These eyes have watched with grief, and now would rest;
<dt>Rest we desire, and on thy bosom's peace
<dt>The long slow change to unremembering mould.
