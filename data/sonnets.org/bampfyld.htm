<p>
<dt>What numerous tribes beneath thy shadowy wing,
<dt>O mild and modest evening, find delight!
<dt>First, to the grove his lingering fair to bring,
<dt>The warm and youthful lover, hating light,
<dt>Sighs oft for thee. And next, the boisterous string
<dt>Of school-imps, freed from dame's all-dreaded sight,
<dt>Round village cross in many a wanton ring
<dt>Wishes thy stay. Then too with vasty might
<dt>From steeple's side to urge the bounding ball,
<dt>The lusty hinds await thy fragrant call.
<dt>I, general friend, by turns am joined with all,
<dt>Lover, and elfin gay, and harmless hind;
<dt>Nor heed the proud, to real wisdom blind,
<dt>So as my heart be pure, and free my mind.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Written at a Farm</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Around my porch and lonely casement spread
<dt>The myrtle never sear and gadding vine
<dt>With fragrant sweetbriar love to intertwine;
<dt>And in my garden's box-encircled bed
<dt>The pansy pied and musk-rose white and red,
<dt>The pink, the lily chaste, and sweet woodbine
<dt>Fling odours round: thick woven eglantine
<dt>Decks my trim fence; in which, by silence led,
<dt>The wren hath wisely built her mossy cell,
<dt>Sheltered from storms in courtly land so rife,
<dt>And nestles over her young and warbles well.
<dt>'Tis here, with innocence in peaceful glen,
<dt>I pass my blameless moments, far from men;
<dt>Nor wishing death too soon, nor asking life.

<p>
<dt>It is not for Muse like mine, in rude essay,
<dt>To paint the beauties of thy classic page;
<dt>Which ay deserve far other patronage
<dt>Than the small meed sincere she fain would pay
<dt>Of verse, grave eulogy, or distich gay;
<dt>For that thou deignst inform this sapient age,
<dt>What ere was whilom told by tuneful sage,
<dt>Or harped in hall or bower on solemn day;
<dt>But more for that thy skill, the minstrel throng
<dt>Forbids in cold oblivion's arms to lie,
<dt>Dear long-lost masters of the British song,
<dt>They shall requite thee better far than I;
<dt>And other climes, and other shades among,
<dt>Weave thee a laureate wreath that never shall die.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>In Praise of Delia</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Cold is the senseless heart, that never strove
<dt>With the mild tumult of a real flame,
<dt>Rugged the breast that beauty cannot tame
<dt>Nor youth's enlivening graces teach to love.
<dt>The pathless vale, the long forsaken grove,
<dt>The rocky cave that bears the fair one's name,
<dt>With ivy mantled over. For empty fame
<dt>Let him amidst the rabble toil, or rove
<dt>For plunder far to western clime.
<dt>Give me to waste the hours in amorous play
<dt>With Delia, beauteous maid; or build the rhyme
<dt>Praising her flowing hair, her snowy arms,
<dt>And all that prodigality of charms
<dt>Formed to enslave my heart and grace my lay.
