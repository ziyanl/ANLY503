<p>   "Born in Ossawatomie, Kansas, in 1859; a graduate of the 
State University, in which he is now Professor of German Language and 
Literature.&nbsp; He received the degree of M.A. at Harvard in 1889.&nbsp; He is 
a joint author of the <em>History of Municipal Suffrage in Kansas</em> , and coeditor of <em>Sunflowers</em>         
           
            ,—poems of his university.&nbsp; 
His birthplace recalls Mr. Stedman's poem, and he has himself written a sonnet 
on John Brown. (<a href="bibliogr.htm#crandall">Crandall</a>)
<h2>O Grave, Where Is   Thy Victory</h2>
<p>
<dt>For twenty years did Nature wait without,
<dt>Besetting that storm-beaten tenement,
<dt>Claiming her debt.&nbsp; From door to door she went,
<dt>Rude battering with all her hostile rout;
<dt>And we who, helpless watching, stood about
<dt>While frail walls tottered and light bolts were bent,
<dt>Thinking each day to see some fatal rent,
<dt>Did marvel much that house should be so stout.
<dt>
<dt>But Love was there, the Lord of Life and Death,
<dt>And held the importunate enemy at bay;
<dt>Yet when his work was done, all peacefully,
<dt>As dawn grows day, Life yielded up his breath,
<dt>And, led by Love Immortal, went away
<dt>Surrendering to a vanquished enemy.
