<a name=010></a><h2>Kings of Men</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As hills seem Alps, when veiled in misty shroud,
<dt>Some men seem kings, through mists of ignorance;
<dt>Must we have darkness, then, and cloud on cloud,
<dt>To give our hills and pigmy kings a chance?
<dt>Must we conspire to curse the humbling light,
<dt>Lest some one, at whose feet our fathers bowed,
<dt>Should suddenly appear, full length, in sight,
<dt>Scaring to laughter the adoring crowd?
<dt>Oh, no! God send us light!--Who loses then?
<dt>The king of slaves and not the king of men.
<dt>True kings are kings for ever, crowned of God,
<dt>The King of kings--we need not fear for them.
<dt>'Tis only the usurper's diadem
<dt>That shakes at touch of light, revealing fraud.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Patriot</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>God help the man who mortgages his life
<dt>For patriot dues! Henceforward he is safe
<dt>No more. His noblest virtues only chafe
<dt>The hydra that he serves to lust of strife.
<dt>His self-respect, his every social tie,
<dt>All that for which the world's best heroes fight
<dt>Must be surrendered, or, unless he die,
<dt>He is a slave--mayhap a despot slave,
<dt>Like Dionysius, fearful of the light,
<dt>Or Belisarius, begging to his grave
<dt>Through streets o'er which his conquering banners wave.
<dt>And his reward--to have poor poets sigh
<dt>Above his dust the requiem of the brave.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Antigone</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If Homer ne'er had sung; if Socrates
<dt>Had never lived in virtue's cause to die;
<dt>If the wild chorus of the circling seas
<dt>Had never echoed back poor Sappho's sigh;
<dt>If Sparta had not, with the purest blood,
<dt>Traced on all time the name "Thermopyl&aelig;";
<dt>If Greece, united through the surging flood
<dt>Of Persian pride, had not arisen free;
<dt>If nought of great, or wise, or brave, or good
<dt>Had proved thee, Hellas, what thou wast to be;
<dt>Save that thou didst create "Antigone"--
<dt>Thou still had'st in the van of nations stood.
<dt>Fallen are thy noblest temples, but above
<dt>Them all still stands thy shrine of Woman's Love.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>The Wheat's Reward</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Out of the ground I rose; the seed seemed dead,
<dt>But lo! a slim green arm pushed through the sod,
<dt>And by and by before my maker, God,
<dt>I stood full ripe. A voice cried: "Give us bread."
<dt>The wind of God went by; I bowed my head,
<dt>And one approached who held a curv&eacute;d knife,
<dt>And for the life of men he took my life,
<dt>And ever since by me are millions fed.
<dt>And then God spake these words: "O blessed weed,
<dt>The lowly sister of the lily proud,
<dt>Be thou my chosen messenger to shroud
<dt>The mystery of my Son, the Woman's seed.
<dt>Thou dreadest not the sacrificial knife--
<dt>Be thou to dying men the Bread of Life.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The Dark Ages</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The years through which aught that hath life, O Sun,
<dt>Hath watched or felt thy rising, what are they
<dt>To those vast &aelig;ons when, from night to day,
<dt>From dawn to dark, thy circuit thou didst run,
<dt>With none to greet thee or regret thee; none
<dt>To bless thy glowing harbinger of cloud,
<dt>Rose-tinted; none to sigh when, like a shroud,
<dt>The banner of Night proclaimed her victory won?
<dt>Yet, through that reign of seeming death, so long
<dt>To our imperfect ken, the marvellous force
<dt>Which means to ends adjusts in Nature's plan
<dt>Was bringing to the birth that eye of man,
<dt>Which now, O Sun, surveys thy farthest course--
<dt>A speck amid the countless starry throng.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>The Heart of Man</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Has aught been changed, or is there any more
<dt>To tell of what the human heart can feel?
<dt>Or is there any phase of woe or weal
<dt>That has not been a thousand times before?
<dt>We live the life our fathers lived of yore--
<dt>Our loves, our hates, our longings are the same;
<dt>Our creeds have little changed except in name,
<dt>And our wise books repeat the ancient lore.
<dt>The men who walked in Babylon's proud streets
<dt>Were just such men as walk our streets today;
<dt>And the fair maid who blushes as she meets
<dt>Her lover, such as she, far, far away,
<dt>Long, long ago (oft has the tale been told),
<dt>Was many a sweet fair maid who lived of old.
