<h1>Paul Veronese: Three Sonnets</h1>
<p>
<a name=001></a><h2>I</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Paul, let thy faces from the canvas look
<dt>Haply less clearly than Pietro's can,
<dt>Less lively than in tints of Titian,
<dt>Or him who both the bay-wreath-chaplets took:
<dt>Yet shalt thou therefore have no harsh rebuke
<dt>Of me whom, while with eager eye I scan
<dt>O'er painted pomps of Brera and Vatican,
<dt>The first delight thou gavest ne'er forsook.
<dt>For in thy own Verona, long ago,
<dt>Before one masterpiece of cool arcades,
<dt>I made a friend; and such a friend was rare.
<dt>For him, I love thy velvet's glorious show,
<dt>Thy sheens of silk 'twixt marble balustrades,
<dt>Thy breathing-space and full translucent air.
</p>
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>II</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Loved for themselves, too. Oft as I behold,
<dt>Adown the curtain'd gallery's sumptuous gloom,
<dt>A separate daylight shining in the room,
<dt>There find I still thy groupings manifold
<dt>Of holy clerks, of nobles grave and bold,
<dt>Swart slaves, brave gallants, maidens in their bloom,
<dt>With what of Persian and Ligarian loom
<dt>May best consort with marble dome and gold:
<dt>There find thy dog, whose teeth Time's teeth defy
<dt>To raze the name from less enduring leaves
<dt>Of loved Canossa: there, in cynic ease,
<dt>Thy monkey: and beneath the pearly sky
<dt>See lovely ladies wave their handkerchiefs,
<dt>And lend sweet looks from airy balconies.
</p>
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>They err who say this long-withdrawing line
<dt>Of palace-fronts Palladian, this brocade
<dt>From looms of Genoa, this gold-inlaid
<dt>Resplendent plate of Milan, that combine
<dt>To spread soft lustre through the grand design,
<dt>Show but in fond factitious masquerade
<dt>The actual feast by leper Simon made
<dt>For that great Guest, of old, in Palestine.
<dt>Christ walks amongst us still; at liberal table
<dt>Scorns not to sit: no sorrowing Magdalene
<dt>But of these dear feet kindly gets her kiss
<dt>Now, even as then; and thou, be honorable,
<dt>Who, by the might of thy majestic scene,
<dt>Bringest down that age and minglest it with this.
