<p>
<dt>Young laughters, and my music! Aye till now
<dt>The voice can reach no blending minors near;
<dt>'Tis the bird's trill because the spring is here
<dt>And spring means trilling on a blossomy bough;
<dt>'Tis the spring joy that has no why or how,
<dt>But sees the sun and hopes not nor can fear--
<dt>Spring is so sweet and spring seems all the year.
<dt>Dear voice, the first-come birds but trill as thou.
<p>
<dt>Oh music of my heart, be thus for long:
<dt>Too soon the spring bird learns the later song;
<dt>Too soon a sadder sweetness slays content
<dt>Too soon! There comes new light on onward day,
<dt>There comes new perfume o'er a rosier way:
<dt>Comes not again the young spring joy that went.

<a name=011></a><h2>XI. Love's Mourner</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>'Tis men who say that through all hurt and pain
<dt>The woman's love, wife's, mother's, still will hold,
<dt>And breathes the sweeter and will more unfold
<dt>For winds that tear it, and the sorrowful rain.
<dt>So in a thousand voices has the strain
<dt>Of this dear patient madness been retold,
<dt>That men call woman's love. Ah! they are bold,
<dt>Naming for love that grief which <strong>does</strong> remain.
<p>
<dt>Love faints that looks on baseness face to face:
<dt>Love pardons all; but by the pardonings dies,
<dt>With a fresh wound of each pierced through the breast.
<dt>And there stand pityingly in Love's void place
<dt>Kindness of household wont familiar-wise,
<dt>And faith to Love--faith to our dead at rest.

<p>
<dt>She has made me wayside posies: here they stand,
<dt>Bringing fresh memories of where they grew.
<dt>As new-come travellers from a world we knew
<dt>Wake every while some image of their land,
<dt>So these whose buds our woodland breezes fanned
<dt>Bring to my room the meadow where they blew,
<dt>The brook-side cliff, the elms where wood-doves coo--
<dt>And every flower is dearer for her hand.
<p>
<dt>Oh blossoms of the paths she loves to tread,
<dt>Some grace of her is in all thoughts you bear:
<dt>For in my memories of your homes that were
<dt>The old sweet loneliness they kept is fled,
<dt>And would I think it back I find instead
<dt>A presence of my darling mingling there.

<p>
<dt>'Tis hard that the full summer of our round
<dt>Is but the turn where winter's sign-post's writ;
<dt>That to have reached the best is leaving it;
<dt>That final loss bears date from having found.
<dt>So some proud vessel in a narrow sound
<dt>Sails at high water with the fair wind fit,
<dt>And lo! the ebb along the sandy spit,
<dt>Lower and lower till she jars, aground.
<p>
<dt>'Tis hard. We are young still but more content;
<dt>'Tis our ripe flush, the heyday of our prime;
<dt>We learn full breath, how rich of the air we are!
<dt>But suddenly we note a touch of time,
<dt>A little fleck that scarcely seems to mar;
<dt>And we know then that some time since youth went.
<p>

<p>
<dt>The brook leaps riotous with its life just found,
<dt>That freshets from the mountain rains have fed,
<dt>Beats at the boulders in its hindered bed,
<dt>And fills the valley with its triumphing sound.
<dt>The strong unthirsty tarn sunk in deep ground
<dt>Has never a sigh wherewith its wealth is said,
<dt>Has no more ripples than the May-flies tread:
<dt>Silence of waters is where they abound.
<p>
<dt>And love, whatever love, sure, makes small boast:
<dt>'Tis the new lovers tell, in wonder yet.
<dt>Oh happy need! Enriched stream's jubilant gush!
<dt>But who being spouses well have learned love's most,
<dt>Being child and mother learned not nor forget,
<dt>These in their joyfulness feel the tarn's strong hush.
<p>
<a name=023></a><h2>XXIII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Birds sing "I love you, love" the whole day through,
<dt>And not another song can they sing right;
<dt>But, singing done with, loving's done with quite,
<dt>The autumn sunders every twittering two.
<dt>And I'd not have love make too much ado
<dt>With sweet parades of fondness and delight,
<dt>Lest iterant wont should make caresses trite,
<dt>Love-names mere cuckoo ousters of the true.
<p>
<dt>Oh heart can hear heart's sense in senseless nought,
<dt>And heart that's sure of heart has little speech.
<dt>What shall it tell? The other knows its thought.
<dt>What shall one doubt or question or beseech
<dt>Who is assured and knows and, unbesought,
<dt>Possesses the dear trust that each gives each.
