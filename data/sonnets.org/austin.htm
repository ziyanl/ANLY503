<p>English Poet Laureate.  "One of Mr. Austin's pleasantest characteristics as a poet is his intense love of nature, more especially of nature in her spring aspects: also, I may add, a very ardent love of Country and pride therein." (<a href="bibliogr.htm#sharp1">Sharp</a>)

<a name="010"></a><h2>Love's Blindness</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p>
<dt>Now do I know that Love is blind, for I
<dt>Can see no beauty on this beauteous earth,
<dt>No life, no light, no hopefulness, no mirth,
<dt>Pleasure nor purpose, when thou art not nigh.
<dt>Thy absence exiles sunshine from the sky,
<dt>Seres Spring's maturity, checks Summer's birth,
<dt>Leaves linnet's pipe as sad as plover's cry,
<dt>And makes me in abundance find but dearth.
<dt>But when thy feet flutter the dark, and thou
<dt>With orient eyes dawnest on my distress,
<dt>Suddenly sings a bird on every bough,
<dt>The heavens expand, the earth grows less and less,
<dt>The ground is buoyant as the ether now,
<dt>And all looks lovely in thy loveliness.
<p>
<a name="020"></a><h2>Love's Wisdom</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Now on the summit of Love's topmost peak
<dt>Kiss we and part; no further can we go:
<dt>And better death than we from high to low
<dt>Should dwindle or decline from strong to weak.
<dt>We have found all, there is no more to seek;
<dt>All have we proved, no more is there to know;
<dt>And time could only tutor us to eke
<dt>Out rapture's warmth with custom's afterglow.
<dt>We cannot keep at such a height as this;
<dt>For even straining souls like ours inhale
<dt>But once in life so rarefied a bliss.
<dt>What if we lingered till love's breath should fail!
<dt>Heaven of my Earth! one more celestial kiss,
<dt>Then down by separate pathways to the vale.
<p>
<a name="030"></a><h2>Unseasonable Snows</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>The leaves have not yet gone; then why do ye come,
<dt>O white flakes falling from a dusky cloud?
<dt>But yesterday my garden-plot was proud
<dt>With uncut sheaves of ripe chrysanthemum.
<dt>Some trees the winds have stripped; but look on some
<dt>'Neath double load of snow and foliage bowed,
<dt>Unnatural Winter fashioning a shroud
<dt>For Autumn's burial ere its pulse be numb.
<dt>Yet Nature plays not an inhuman part:
<dt>In her, our own vicissitudes we trace.
<dt>Do we not cling to our accustomed place,
<dt>Though journeying Death have beckoned us to start?
<dt>And faded smiles oft linger in the face,
<dt>While grief's first flakes fall silent on the heart!
<p>
<a name="040"></a><h2>A Sleepless Night</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Within the hollow silence of the night
<dt>I lay awake and listened. I could hear
<dt>Planet with punctual planet chiming clear,
<dt>And unto star star cadencing aright.
<dt>Nor these alone: cloistered from deafening sight,
<dt>All things that are made music to my ear:
<dt>Hushed woods, dumb caves, and many a soundless mere,
<dt>With Arctic mains in rigid sleep locked tight.
<dt>But ever with this chant from shore and sea,
<dt>From singing constellation, humming thought,
<dt>And Life through Time's stops blowing variously,
<dt>A melancholy undertone was wrought;
<dt>And from its boundless prison-house I caught
<dt>The awful wail of lone Eternity.
<p>
<a name="050"></a><h2>To England</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<h3>(Written in Mid-Channel.)</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Now upon English soil I soon shall stand,
<dt>Homeward from climes that fancy deems more fair;
<dt>And well I know that there will greet me there
<dt>No soft foam fawning upon smiling strand,
<dt>No scent of orange-groves, no zephyrs bland;
<dt>But Amazonian March, with breast half bare
<dt>And sleety arrows whistling through the air,
<dt>Will be my welcome from that burly land.
<dt>Yet he who boasts his birth-place yonder lies
<dt>Owns in his heart a mood akin to scorn
<dt>For sensuous slopes that bask 'neath Southern skies,
<dt>Teeming with wine and prodigal of corn,
<dt>And, gazing through the mist with misty eyes,
<dt>Blesses the brave bleak land where he was born.
<p>
<a name="060"></a><h2>"When acorns fall, and swallows troop for flight"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>When acorns fall, and swallows troop for flight,
<dt>And hope matured slow mellows to regret,
<dt>And Autumn, pressed by Winter for his debt,
<dt>Drops leaf on leaf till she be beggared quite;
<dt>Should then the crescent moon's unselfish light
<dt>Gleam up the sky just as the sun doth set,
<dt>Her brightening gaze, though day and dark have met,
<dt>Prolongs the gloaming and retards the night.
<dt>So, fair young life, new risen upon mine
<dt>Just as it owns the edict of decay
<dt>And Fancy's fires should pale and pass away,
<dt>My menaced glory takes a glow from thine,
<dt>And, in the deepening sundown of my day,
<dt>Thou with thy dawn delayest my decline.
