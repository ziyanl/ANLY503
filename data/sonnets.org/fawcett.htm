<p>"From <i>Fantasy and Passion</i> (1878); Song and Story (1884); and Romance and Reverie (1886).  This charming poet and novelist is one of the most noteworthy sonnet-writers in America.

<a name=010></a><h2>Other Worlds</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I sometimes muse, when my adventurous gaze
<dt>Has roamed the starry arches of the night,
<dt>That were I dowered with strong angelic sight,
<dt>All would look changed in those pale heavenly ways.
<dt>What wheeling worlds my vision would amaze!
<dt>What chasms of gloom would thrill me and affright!
<dt>What rhythmic equipoise would rouse delight!
<dt>What moons would beam on me, what suns would blaze!
<p>
<dt>Then through my awed soul sweeps the larger thought
<dt>Of how creation's edict may have set
<dt>Vast human multitudes on those far spheres
<dt>With towering passions to which mine mean naught,
<dt>With majesties of happiness, or yet
<dt>With agonies of unconjectured tears!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Earthquake</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A giant of awful strength, he dumbly lies
<dt>Far-prisoned among the solemn deeps of earth;
<dt>The sinewy grandeurs of his captive girth,--
<dt>His great-thewed breast, colossally-moulded thighs,
<dt>And arms thick-roped with muscle of mighty size,
<dt>Repose in slumber where no dream gives birth
<dt>For months, even years, to any grief or mirth;
<dt>A slumber of tranquil lips, calm-lidded eyes!
<p>
<dt>Yet sometimes to his spirit a dream will creep
<dt>Of the old glad past when clothed in dauntless pride
<dt>He walked the world, unchained by tyrannous powers;
<dt>And then, while he tosses restlessly in sleep,
<dt>Dark, terrible graves for living shapes yawn wide,
<dt>Or a city shrieks among her tottering towers!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Indian Summer</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Dulled to a drowsy fire, one hardly sees
<dt>The sun in heaven, where this broad smoky round
<dt>Lies ever brooding at the horizon's bound;
<dt>And through the gaunt knolls, on monotonous leas
<dt>Or through the damp wood's troops of naked trees,
<dt>Rustling the brittle ruin along their ground,
<dt>Like sighs from souls of perished hours, resound
<dt>The melancholy melodies of the breeze!
<p>
<dt>So ghostly and strange a look the blurred world wears,
<dt>Viewed from the flowerless garden's dreary squares,
<dt>That now, while these weird vaporous days exist,
<dt>It would not seem a marvel if where we walk,
<dt>We met, dim-glimmering on its thorny stalk,
<dt>Some pale intangible rose with leaves of mist!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Sleep's Threshold</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What footstep but has wandered free and far
<dt>Amid that Castle of Sleep whose walls were planned
<dt>By no terrestrial craft, no human hand,
<dt>With towers that point to no recorded star?
<dt>Here sorrows, memories, and remorses are,
<dt>Roaming the long, dim rooms or galleries grand;
<dt>Here the lost friends our spirits yet demand
<dt>Gleam through mysterious door-ways left ajar.
<p>
<dt>But of the uncounted throngs that ever win
<dt>The halls where Slumber's dusky witcheries rule,
<dt>Who after wakening, may reveal aright
<dt>By what phantasmal means he entered in?--
<dt>What porch of cloud, what vapory vestibule,
<dt>What stairway quarried from the mines of night?
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>A Tiger-Lily</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Strange that in your dark-dappled sanguine flower
<dt>The sculpturesque repose can still endure
<dt>Of that celestial lily, wrought so pure
<dt>It lives as chastity's white type this hour!
<dt>By what mysterious art, what baleful power,
<dt>Did you, Diana of all blooms, allure
<dt>From Nature's mood this Maenad vestiture,
<dt>And mock with gaudy tints your taintless dower?
<p>
<dt>Nay, long ago, I dream, through some warm dell
<dt>Of Asian lands a weary tiger stole
<dt>Where you, in pale bud, felt your first dews cling;
<dt>And while he slept beneath you, it befell
<dt>That all his deadly beauty pierced your soul
<dt>And made you this fantastic sultry thing!
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Silence</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>All search of yours but ineffectual seems
<dt>To gain some coign of refuge, year by year;
<dt>Since far in loneliest woods, in wastes austere,
<dt>Winds call, beasts wander, or yet the vulture screams.
<dt>With hated sounds of life all nature teems,
<dt>And even among the deeps of sleep you hear
<dt>Voices now clad in distance or now clear,
<dt>That float forever from the lips of dreams!
<p>
<dt>But weary of spirit, and affrighted too,
<dt>At last you hurry away, with footsteps fleet,
<dt>To find, in chaos, torpor, and eclipse,
<dt>Death, your one lover inalienably true,
<dt>Encircled by whose ghostly arms you meet
<dt>The awful icy passion of his lips!
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>Suicide</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Invisible as a wind along the sky,
<dt>She ever wanders o'er the earth immense,
<dt>A spirit of beauty but malevolence,
<dt>With foot unechoing and with furtive eye.
<dt>She loathes and shuns all haunts where peace may lie,
<dt>Or love, and every joy engendered thence,
<dt>Yet prowls to wait, with wary and avid sense,
<dt>For sorrow's heaviest and most burning sigh!
<p>
<dt>Then, when some dreary sufferer darkly fails
<dt>To find in life's chill heaven one starry trace,
<dt>One hope no menace of despair assails,
<dt>Toward him she steals with sure insidious pace,
<dt>And slowly to his desperate look unveils
<dt>The maddening glooms and splendours of her face!
<p>

<h3>"C'&eacute;tait un d&eacute;mon se tordant sous un ange.</h3>
<h3>Un enfer sous un ciel."</h3>
<h3>--Th&eacute;ophile Gautier</h3>
<p>
<dt>Seeing thy face, with all thy fluctuant hair
<dt>Falling in dull-gold opulence from thy brow,
<dt>Watching thy light-blue eyes, now fired or now
<dt>Laughterful, or now dim as with despair,
<dt>I wonder, friend, that it should be God's care
<dt>To have made at all, what matter when or how,
<dt>A being so sadly, desolately rare,
<dt>So beautifully incomplete as thou!
<p>
<dt>O rank black pool, with one star's imaged form!
<dt>O sweet rich-hearted rose, with rot at core!
<dt>O summer heaven, half purpled by stern storm!
<dt>O lily, with one white leaf dipt in gore!
<dt>O angel-shape, whereover curves and clings
<dt>The awful imminence of a devil's wings!
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>Commonplaces</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Troubled in spirit at the unvaried ways
<dt>Wherewith perpetually I seemed to view,
<dt>In regular and familiar retinue,
<dt>Coming and going, the processional days,
<dt>I yearned to mark with many a novel phase
<dt>This round of dull monotonies that I knew,
<dt>And treat life's commonplaces, dreary of hue,
<dt>As phantoms that the intellect sternly lays!
<p>
<dt>But wheresoe'er my wandering feet might be,
<dt>Like some persistent word that memory saith,
<dt>Or like a ship's own shadow on wastes of sea,
<dt>Or the very wind's inevitable breath,
<dt>I found, among all changes, following me
<dt>The dark ubiquitous commonplace of death!
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>Sleep</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A yellow sunset, soft and dreamy of dye,
<dt>Met sharply by black fluctuant lines of grass;
<dt>A river, glimmering like illumined glass,
<dt>And narrowing till it ends in distant sky;
<dt>Pale scattered pools of luminous rain, that lie
<dt>In shadowy amplitudes of green morass;
<dt>A crescent that the old moon, as moments pass,
<dt>Has turned to a silver acorn hung on high!
<p>
<dt>Now through this melancholy and silent land
<dt>Sleep walks, diaphanous-vestured, vaguely fair,
<dt>Within her vaporous robe and one dim hand
<dt>Much asphodel and lotus doth she bear,
<dt>Going lovely and low-lidded, with a band
<dt>Of dull-red poppies amid her dull-gold hair!
