<a name=000><h1>Sonnets from the Portuguese</h1>
<p>
<a name=001></a><h2>I</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I thought once how Theocritus had sung
<dt>Of the sweet years, the dear and wished for years,
<dt>Who each one in a gracious hand appears
<dt>To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:
<dt>And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,
<dt>I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,
<dt>The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,
<dt>Those of my own life, who by turns had flung
<dt>A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,
<dt>So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move
<dt>Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;
<dt>And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,
<dt>"Guess now who holds thee ?" - "Death," I said. But, there,
<dt>The silver answer rang,--"Not Death, but Love."
</p>
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>II</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>But only three in all God's universe
<dt>Have heard this word thou hast said,--Himself, beside
<dt>Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied
<dt>One of us . . . <i>that</i> was God, . . and laid the curse
<dt>So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce
<dt>My sight from seeing thee,--that if I had died,
<dt>The deathweights, placed there, would have signified
<dt>Less absolute exclusion. "Nay" is worse
<dt>From God than from all others, O my friend!
<dt>Men could not part us with their worldly jars,
<dt>Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;
<dt>Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:
<dt>And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,
<dt>We should but vow the faster for the stars.
</p>
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart!
<dt>Unlike our uses and our destinies.
<dt>Our ministering two angels look surprise
<dt>On one another, as they strike athwart
<dt>Their wings in passing. Thou, bethink thee, art
<dt>A guest for queens to social pageantries,
<dt>With gages from a hundred brighter eyes
<dt>Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part
<dt>Of chief musician. What hast <i>thou</i> to do
<dt>With looking from the lattice-lights at me,
<dt>A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through
<dt>The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?
<dt>The chrism is on thine head,--on mine, the dew,--
<dt>And Death must dig the level where these agree.
</p>
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>IV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou hast thy calling to some palace-floor,
<dt>Most gracious singer of high poems! where
<dt>The dancers will break footing, from the care
<dt>Of watching up thy pregnant lips for more.
<dt>And dost thou lift this house's latch too poor
<dt>For hand of thine? and canst thou think and bear
<dt>To let thy music drop here unaware
<dt>In folds of golden fulness at my door?
<dt>Look up and see the casement broken in,
<dt>The bats and owlets builders in the roof!
<dt>My cricket chirps against thy mandolin.
<dt>Hush, call no echo up in further proof
<dt>Of desolation! there's a voice within
<dt>That weeps  . . as thou must sing . . . alone, aloof.
</p>
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>V</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I lift my heavy heart up solemnly,
<dt>As once Electra her sepulchral urn,
<dt>And, looking in thine eyes, I overturn
<dt>The ashes at thy feet. Behold and see
<dt>What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,
<dt>And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn
<dt>Through the ashen greyness. If thy foot in scorn
<dt>Could tread them out to darkness utterly,
<dt>It might be well perhaps. But if instead
<dt>Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow
<dt>The grey dust up, . . . those laurels on thine head,
<dt>O my Belov&egrave;d, will not shield thee so,
<dt>That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred
<dt>The hair beneath. Stand farther off then! go.
</p>
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>VI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand
<dt>Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore
<dt>Alone upon the threshold of my door
<dt>Of individual life, I shall command
<dt>The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand
<dt>Serenely in the sunshine as before,
<dt>Without the sense of that which I forbore--
<dt>Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land
<dt>Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine
<dt>With pulses that beat double. What I do
<dt>And what I dream include thee, as the wine
<dt>Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue
<dt>God for myself, He hears that name of thine,
<dt>And sees within my eyes the tears of two.
</p>
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>VII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The face of all the world is changed, I think,
<dt>Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul
<dt>Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole
<dt>Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink
<dt>Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,
<dt>Was caught up into love, and taught the whole
<dt>Of life in a new rhythm. The cup of dole
<dt>God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,
<dt>And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.
<dt>The names of country, heaven, are changed away
<dt>For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;
<dt>And this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday,
<dt>(The singing angels know) are only dear
<dt>Because thy name moves right in what they say.
</p>
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>VIII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What can I give thee back, O liberal
<dt>And princely giver, who hast brought the gold
<dt>And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,
<dt>And laid them on the outside of the wall
<dt>For such as I to take or leave withal,
<dt>In unexpected largesse? am I cold,
<dt>Ungrateful, that for these most manifold
<dt>High gifts, I render nothing back at all?
<dt>Not so; not cold,--but very poor instead.
<dt>Ask God who knows. For frequent tears have run
<dt>The colours from my life, and left so dead
<dt>And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done
<dt>To give the same as pillow to thy head.
<dt>Go farther! let it serve to trample on.
</p>
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>IX</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Can it be right to give what I can give?
<dt>To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears
<dt>As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years
<dt>Re-sighing on my lips renunciative
<dt>Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live
<dt>For all thy adjurations? O my fears,
<dt>That this can scarce be right! We are not peers,
<dt>So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve,
<dt>That givers of such gifts as mine are, must
<dt>Be counted with the ungenerous. Out, alas!
<dt>I will not soil thy purple with my dust,
<dt>Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,
<dt>Nor give thee any love--which were unjust.
<dt>Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass.
</p>
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>X</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
<dt>And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright,
<dt>Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
<dt>Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
<dt>And love is fire. And when I say at need
<dt><i>I love thee</i> . . . mark! . . . <i>I love thee</i>--in thy sight
<dt>I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
<dt>With conscience of the new rays that proceed
<dt>Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low
<dt>In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
<dt>Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
<dt>And what I <i>feel</i>, across the inferior features
<dt>Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show
<dt>How that great work of Love enhances Nature's.
</p>
<p>
<a name=011></a><h2>XI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>And therefore if to love can be desert,
<dt>I am not all unworthy. Cheeks as pale
<dt>As these you see, and trembling knees that fail
<dt>To bear the burden of a heavy heart,--
<dt>This weary minstrel-life that once was girt
<dt>To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail
<dt>To pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale
<dt>A melancholy music,--why advert
<dt>To these things? O Belov&egrave;d, it is plain
<dt>I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!
<dt>And yet, because I love thee, I obtain
<dt>From that same love this vindicating grace,
<dt>To live on still in love, and yet in vain,--
<dt>To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.
</p>
<p>
<a name=012></a><h2>XII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Indeed this very love which is my boast,
<dt>And which, when rising up from breast to brow,
<dt>Doth crown me with a ruby large enow
<dt>To draw men's eyes and prove the inner cost,--
<dt>This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,
<dt>I should not love withal, unless that thou
<dt>Hadst set me an example, shown me how,
<dt>When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,
<dt>And love called love. And thus, I cannot speak
<dt>Of love even, as a good thing of my own:
<dt>Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,
<dt>And placed it by thee on a golden throne,
<dt>And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)
<dt>Is by thee only, whom I love alone.
</p>
<p>
<a name=013></a><h2>XIII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>And wilt thou have me fashion into speech
<dt>The love I bear thee, finding words enough,
<dt>And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,
<dt>Between our faces, to cast light on each?--
<dt>I drop at thy feet. I cannot teach
<dt>My hand to hold my spirit so far off
<dt>From myself--me--that I should bring thee proof
<dt>In words, of love hid in me out of reach.
<dt>Nay, let the silence of my womanhood
<dt>Commend my woman-love to thy belief,--
<dt>Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,
<dt>And rend the garment of my life, in brief,
<dt>By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,
<dt>Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.
</p>

<P>
<dt>If thou must love me, let it be for nought
<dt>Except for love's sake only. Do not say
<dt>"I love her for her smile--her look--her way
<dt>Of speaking gently,--for a trick of thought
<dt>That falls in well with mine, and certes brought
<dt>A sense of pleasant ease on such a day"--
<dt>For these things in themselves, Beloved, may
<dt>Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought,
<dt>May be unwrought so. Neither love me for
<dt>Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,--
<dt>A creature might forget to weep, who bore
<dt>Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!
<dt>But love me for love's sake, that evermore
<dt>Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity.
</P>
<p>
<a name=015></a><h2>XV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear
<dt>Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;
<dt>For we two look two ways, and cannot shine
<dt>With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.
<dt>On me thou lookest with no doubting care,
<dt>As on a bee shut in a crystalline;
<dt>Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love's divine,
<dt>And to spread wing and fly in the outer air
<dt>Were most impossible failure, if I strove
<dt>To fail so. But I look on thee--on thee--
<dt>Beholding, besides love, the end of love,
<dt>Hearing oblivion beyond memory!
<dt>As one who sits and gazes from above,
<dt>Over the rivers to the bitter sea.
</p>
<p>
<a name=016></a><h2>XVI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>And yet, because thou overcomest so,
<dt>Because thou art more noble and like a king,
<dt>Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
<dt>Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow
<dt>Too close against thine heart henceforth to know
<dt>How it shook when alone. Why, conquering
<dt>May prove as lordly and complete a thing
<dt>In lifting upward, as in crushing low!
<dt>And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
<dt>To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,--
<dt>Even so, Belov&egrave;d, I at last record,
<dt>Here ends my strife. If <i>thou</i> invite me forth,
<dt>I rise above abasement at the word.
<dt>Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth.

<p>
<dt>My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes
<dt>God set between His After and Before,
<dt>And strike up and strike off the general roar
<dt>Of the rushing worlds, a melody that floats
<dt>In a serene air purely. Antidotes
<dt>Of medicated music, answering for
<dt>Mankind's forlornest uses, thou canst pour
<dt>From thence into their ears. God's will devotes
<dt>Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.
<dt>How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?
<dt>A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine
<dt>Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?
<dt>A shade, in which to sing--of palm or pine?
<dt>A grave, on which to rest from singing? . . . Choose.

<a name=018></a><h2>XVIII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I never gave a lock of hair away
<dt>To a man, dearest, except this to thee,
<dt>Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully,
<dt>I ring out to the full brown length and say
<dt>"Take it." My day of youth went yesterday;
<dt>My hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee,
<dt>Nor plant I it from rose or myrtle-tree,
<dt>As girls do, any more: it only may
<dt>Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
<dt>Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
<dt>Through sorrow's trick. I thought the funeral-shears
<dt>Would take this first, but Love is justified,--
<dt>Take it thou,--finding pure, from all those years,
<dt>The kiss my mother left here when she died.

<p>
<a name=019></a><h2>XIX</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise;
<dt>I barter curl for curl upon that mart,
<dt>And from my poet's forehead to my heart
<dt>Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,--
<dt>As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes
<dt>The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
<dt>The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart, . . .
<dt>The bay-crown's shade, Belov&egrave;d, I surmise,
<dt>Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!
<dt>Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,
<dt>I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,
<dt>And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;
<dt>Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack
<dt>No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.
</p>
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>XX</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Belov&egrave;d, my Belov&egrave;d, when I think
<dt>That thou wast in the world a year ago,
<dt>What time I sat alone here in the snow
<dt>And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink
<dt>No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,
<dt>Went counting all my chains as if that so
<dt>They never could fall off at any blow
<dt>Struck by thy possible hand,--why, thus I drink
<dt>Of life's great cup of wonder! Wonderful,
<dt>Never to feel thee thrill the day or night
<dt>With personal act or speech,--nor ever cull
<dt>Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white
<dt>Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as dull,
<dt>Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight.
</P>
<p>
<a name=021></a><h2>XXI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Say over again, and yet once over again,
<dt>That thou dost love me. Though the word repeated
<dt>Should seem "a cuckoo-song," as thou dost treat it,
<dt>Remember, never to the hill or plain,
<dt>Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain
<dt>Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.
<dt>Belov&egrave;d, I, amid the darkness greeted
<dt>By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt's pain
<dt>Cry, "Speak once more--thou lovest!" Who can fear
<dt>Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,
<dt>Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?
<dt>Say thou dost love me, love me, love me--toll
<dt>The silver iterance!--only minding, Dear,
<dt>To love me also in silence with thy soul.
</p>
<p>
<a name=022></a><h2>XXII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When our two souls stand up erect and strong,
<dt>Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,
<dt>Until the lengthening wings break into fire
<dt>At either curv&egrave;d point,--what bitter wrong
<dt>Can the earth do to us, that we should not long
<dt>Be here contented?  Think. In mounting higher,
<dt>The angels would press on us and aspire
<dt>To drop some golden orb of perfect song
<dt>Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay
<dt>Rather on earth, Belov&egrave;d,--where the unfit
<dt>Contrarious moods of men recoil away
<dt>And isolate pure spirits, and permit
<dt>A place to stand and love in for a day,
<dt>With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.

<p>
<dt>Is it indeed so? If I lay here dead,
<dt>Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?
<dt>And would the sun for thee more coldly shine
<dt>Because of grave-damps falling round my head?
<dt>I marvelled, my Belov&egrave;d, when I read
<dt>Thy thought so in the letter. I am thine--
<dt>But . . . <i>so</i> much to thee? Can I pour thy wine
<dt>While my hands tremble? Then my soul, instead
<dt>Of dreams of death, resumes life's lower range.
<dt>Then, love me, Love! Look on me--breathe on me!
<dt>As brighter ladies do not count it strange,
<dt>For love, to give up acres and degree,
<dt>I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange
<dt>My near sweet view of Heaven, for earth with thee!
</p>
<p>
<a name=024></a><h2>XXIV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Let the world's sharpness, like a clasping knife,
<dt>Shut in upon itself and do no harm
<dt>In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,
<dt>And let us hear no sound of human strife
<dt>After the click of the shutting. Life to life--
<dt>I lean upon thee, dear, without alarm,
<dt>And feel as safe as guarded by a charm
<dt>Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife
<dt>Are weak to injure. Very whitely still

<dt>A heavy heart, Belov&egrave;d, have I borne
<dt>From year to year until I saw thy face,
<dt>And sorrow after sorrow took the place
<dt>Of all those natural joys as lightly worn
<dt>As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn
<dt>By a beating heart at dance-time. Hopes apace
<dt>Were changed to long despairs, till God's own grace
<dt>Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
<dt>My heavy heart. Then <i>thou</i> didst bid me bring
<dt>And let it drop adown thy calmly great
<dt>Deep being! Fast it sinketh, as a thing
<dt>Which its own nature doth precipitate,
<dt>While thine doth close above it, mediating
<dt>Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.

<dt>I lived with visions for my company
<dt>Instead of men and women, years ago,
<dt>And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know
<dt>A sweeter music than they played to me.
<dt>But soon their trailing purple was not free
<dt>Of this world's dust, their lutes did silent grow,
<dt>And I myself grew faint and blind below
<dt>Their vanishing eyes. Then <font size="-1">THOU</font> didst come--to be,
<dt>Belov&egrave;d, what they seemed. Their shining fronts,
<dt>Their songs, their splendours (better, yet the same,

<dt>Met in thee, and from out thee overcame

<dt>Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame.
