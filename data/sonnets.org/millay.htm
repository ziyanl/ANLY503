<p>
<dt>Thou art not lovelier than lilacs,--no,
<dt>Nor honeysuckle; thou art not more fair
<dt>Than small white single poppies,--I can bear
<dt>Thy beauty; though I bend before thee, though
<dt>From left to right, not knowing where to go,
<dt>I turn my troubled eyes, nor here nor there
<dt>Find any refuge from thee, yet I swear
<dt>So has it been with mist,--with moonlight so.
<dt>Like him who day by day unto his draught
<dt>Of delicate poison adds him one drop more
<dt>Till he may drink unharmed the death of ten,
<dt>Even so, inured to beauty, who have quaffed
<dt>Each hour more deeply than the hour before,
<dt>I drink--and live--what has destroyed some men.

<a name=102></a><h2>"Time does not bring relief..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Time does not bring relief; you all have lied
<dt>Who told me time would ease me of my pain!
<dt>I miss him in the weeping of the rain;
<dt>I want him at the shrinking of the tide;
<dt>The old snows melt from every mountain-side,
<dt>And last year's leaves are smoke in every lane;
<dt>But last year's bitter loving must remain
<dt>Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide!
<dt>There are a hundred places where I fear
<dt>To go,--so with his memory they brim!
<dt>And entering with relief some quiet place
<dt>Where never fell his foot or shone his face
<dt>I say, "There is no memory of him here!"
<dt>And so stand stricken, so remembering him!
</p>
<p>
<a name=103></a><h2>"Mindful of you the sodden earth in spring"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Mindful of you the sodden earth in spring,
<dt>And all the flowers that in the springtime grow,
<dt>And dusty roads, and thistles, and the slow
<dt>Rising of the round moon, all throats that sing
<dt>The summer through, and each departing wing,
<dt>And all the nests that the bared branches show,
<dt>And all winds that in any weather blow,
<dt>And all the storms that the four seasons bring.
<dt>You go no more on your exultant feet
<dt>Up paths that only mist and morning knew,
<dt>Or watch the wind, or listen to the beat
<dt>Of a bird's wings too high in air to view,--
<dt>But you were something more than young and sweet
<dt>And fair,--and the long year remembers you.

<p>
<dt>Not in this chamber only at my birth--
<dt>When the long hours of that mysterious night
<dt>Were over, and the morning was in sight--
<dt>I cried, but in strange places, steppe and firth
<dt>I have not seen, through alien grief and mirth;
<dt>And never shall one room contain me quite
<dt>Who in so many rooms first saw the light,
<dt>Child of all mothers, native of the earth.
<dt>So is no warmth for me at any fire
<dt>To-day, when the world's fire has burned so low;
<dt>I kneel, spending my breath in vain desire,
<dt>At that cold hearth which one time roared so strong,
<dt>And straighten back in weariness, and long
<dt>To gather up my little gods and go.
</p>

<a name=105></a><h2>"If I should learn, in some quite casual way"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If I should learn, in some quite casual way,
<dt>That you were gone, not to return again--
<dt>Read from the back-page of a paper, say,
<dt>Held by a neighbor in a subway train,
<dt>How at the corner of this avenue
<dt>And such a street (so are the papers filled)
<dt>A hurrying man--who happened to be you--
<dt>At noon to-day had happened to be killed,
<dt>I should not cry aloud--I could not cry
<dt>Aloud, or wring my hands in such a place--
<dt>I should but watch the station lights rush by
<dt>With a more careful interest on my face,
<dt>Or raise my eyes and read with greater care
<dt>Where to store furs and how to treat the hair.

<p>
<dt>This door you might not open, and you did;
<dt>So enter now, and see for what slight thing
<dt>You are betrayed. . . .  Here is no treasure hid,
<dt>No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring
<dt>The sought-for truth, no heads of women slain
<dt>For greed like yours, no writhings of distress,
<dt>But only what you see. . . .  Look yet again--
<dt>An empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless.
<dt>Yet this alone out of my life I kept
<dt>Unto myself, lest any know me quite;
<dt>And you did so profane me when you crept
<dt>Unto the threshold of this room to-night
<dt>That I must never more behold your face.
<dt>This now is yours.  I seek another place.

<a name=201></a><h2>"I shall forget you presently, my dear" (<i><a href="millay1.ram">audio</a></i>)</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I shall forget you presently, my dear,
<dt>So make the most of this, your little day,
<dt>Your little month, your little half a year,
<dt>Ere I forget, or die, or move away,
<dt>And we are done forever; by and by
<dt>I shall forget you, as I said, but now,
<dt>If you entreat me with your loveliest lie
<dt>I will protest you with my favorite vow.
<dt>I would indeed that love were longer-lived,
<dt>And vows were not so brittle as they are,
<dt>But so it is, and nature has contrived
<dt>To struggle on without a break thus far,
<dt>Whether or not we find what we are seeking
<dt>Is idle, biologically speaking.

<p>
<a name=202></a><h2>"Loving you less than life, a little less"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Loving you less than life, a little less
<dt>Than bitter-sweet upon a broken wall
<dt>Or bush-wood smoke in autumn, I confess
<dt>I cannot swear I love you not at all.
<dt>For there is that about you in this light--
<dt>A yellow darkness, sinister of rain--
<dt>Which sturdily recalls my stubborn sight
<dt>To dwell on you, and dwell on you again.
<dt>And I am made aware of many a week
<dt>I shall consume, remembering in what way
<dt>Your brown hair grows about your brow and cheek,
<dt>And what divine absurdities you say:
<dt>Till all the world, and I, and surely you,
<dt>Will know I love you, whether or not I do.
</p>
<p>
<a name=203></a><h2>"Into the golden vessel of great song"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Into the golden vessel of great song
<dt>Let us pour all our passion; breast to breast
<dt>Let other lovers lie, in love and rest;
<dt>Not we,--articulate, so, but with the tongue
<dt>Of all the world: the churning blood, the long
<dt>Shuddering quiet, the desperate hot palms pressed
<dt>Sharply together upon the escaping guest,
<dt>The common soul, unguarded, and grown strong.
<dt>Longing alone is singer to the lute;
<dt>Let still on nettles in the open sigh
<dt>The minstrel, that in slumber is as mute
<dt>As any man, and love be far and high,
<dt>That else forsakes the topmost branch, a fruit
<dt>Found on the ground by every passer-by.
</p>

<a name=204></a><h2>"How healthily their feet upon the floor"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How healthily their feet upon the floor
<dt>Strike down! These are no spirits, but a band
<dt>Of children, surely, leaping hand in hand
<dt>Into the air in groups of three and four,
<dt>Wearing their silken rags as if they wore
<dt>Leaves only and light grasses, or a strand
<dt>Of black elusive seaweed oozing sand,
<dt>And running hard as if along a shore.
<dt>I know how lost forever, and at length
<dt>How still these lovely tossing limbs shall lie,
<dt>And the bright laughter and the panting breath;
<dt>And yet, before such beauty and such strength,
<dt>Once more, as always when the dance is high,
<dt>I am rebuked that I believe in death.
</p>
<p>
<a name=205></a><h2>"Love is not blind..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Love is not blind. I see with single eye
<dt>Your ugliness and other women's grace.
<dt>I know the imperfection of your face,
<dt>The eyes too wide apart, the brow too high
<dt>For beauty. Learned from earliest youth am I
<dt>In loveliness, and cannot so erase
<dt>Its letters from my mind, that I may trace
<dt>You faultless, I must love until I die.
<dt>More subtle is the sovereignty of love:
<dt>So am I caught that when I say, "Not fair,"
<dt>'Tis but as if I said, "Not here--not there
<dt>Not risen--not writing letters." Well I know
<dt>What is this beauty men are babbling of;
<dt>I wonder only why they prize it so.
</p>
<p>
<a name=206></a><h2>"Not with libations, but with shouts and laughter"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Not with libations, but with shouts and laughter
<dt>We drenched the altars of Love's sacred grove,
<dt>Shaking to earth green fruits, impatient after
<dt>The launching of the coloured moths of Love.
<dt>Love's proper myrtle and his mother's zone
<dt>We bound about our irreligious brows,
<dt>And fettered him with garlands of our own,
<dt>And spread a banquet in his frugal house.
<dt>Not yet the god has spoken; but I fear
<dt>Though we should break our bodies in his flame,
<dt>And pour our blood upon his altar, here
<dt>Henceforward is a grove without a name,
<dt>A pasture to the shaggy goats of Pan,
<dt>Whence flee forever a woman and a man.

<a name=207></a><h2>"The light comes back with Columbine..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The light comes back with Columbine; she brings
<dt>A touch of this, a little touch of that,
<dt>Coloured confetti, and a favour hat,
<dt>Patches, and powder, dolls that work by strings
<dt>And moons that work by switches, all the things
<dt>That please a sick man's fancy, and a flat
<dt>Spry convalescent kiss, and a small pat
<dt>Upon the pillow, paper offerings.
<dt>The light goes out with her; the shadows sprawl.
<dt>Where she has left her fragrance like a shawl
<dt>I lie alone and pluck the counterpane,
<dt>Or on a dizzy elbow rise and hark
<dt>And down like dominoes along the dark
<dt>Her little silly laughter spills again!
</p>
<p>
<a name=208></a><h2>"Oh, think not I am faithful to a vow"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oh, think not I am faithful to a vow!
<dt>Faithless am I save to love's self alone.
<dt>Were you not lovely I would leave you now:
<dt>After the feet of beauty fly my own.
<dt>Were you not still my hunger's rarest food,
<dt>And water ever to my wildest thirst,
<dt>I would desert you--think not but I would!
<dt>And seek another as I sought you first.
<dt>But you are mobile as the veering air,
<dt>And all your charms more changeful than the tide,
<dt>Wherefore to be inconstant is no care:
<dt>I have but to continue at your side.
<dt>So wanton, light and false, my love, are you,
<dt>I am most faithless when I most am true.
</p>
<p>
<a name=209></a><h2>"I do but ask that you be always fair"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I do but ask that you be always fair
<dt>That I forever may continue kind;
<dt>Knowing me what I am, you should not dare
<dt>To lapse from beauty ever, nor seek to bind
<dt>My alterable mood with lesser cords;
<dt>Weeping and such soft matters must invite
<dt>To further vagrancy; and bitter words
<dt>Chafe soon to irremediable flight,
<dt>Wherefore I pray you if you love me dearly,
<dt>Less dear to hold me than your own bright charms,
<dt>Whence it may fall that until death, or nearly,
<dt>I shall not move to struggle from your arms:
<dt>Fade if you must,--I would but bid you be
<dt>Like the sweet year, doing all things graciously.
</p>
<p>
<a name=210></a><h2>"I pray you if you love me, bear my joy"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I pray you if you love me, bear my joy
<dt>A little while, or let me weep your tears;
<dt>I, too, have seen the quavering Fate destroy
<dt>Your destiny's bright spinning--the dull sheares
<dt>Meeting not neatly, chewing at the thread,
<dt>Nor can you well be less aware how fine,
<dt>How staunch as wire, and how unwarranted
<dt>Endures the golden fortune that is mine.
<dt>I pray you for this day at least, my dear,
<dt>Fare by my side, that journey in the sun;
<dt>Else must I turn me from the blossoming year
<dt>And walk in grief the way that you have gone.
<dt>Let us go forth together to the spring:
<dt>Love must be this, if it be anything.

<p>
<dt>I think I should have loved you presently,
<dt>And given in earnest words I flung in jest;
<dt>And lifted honest eyes for you to see,
<dt>And caught your hand against my cheek and breast;
<dt>And all my pretty follies flung aside
<dt>That won you to me, and beneath your gaze,
<dt>Naked of reticence and shorn of pride,
<dt>Spread like a chart my little wicked ways.
<dt>I, that had been to you, had you remained,
<dt>But one more waking frorn a recurrent dream,
<dt>Cherish no less the certain stakes I gained,
<dt>And walk your memory's halls, austere, supreme,
<dt>A ghost in marble of a girl you knew
<dt>Who would have loved you in a day or two.

<p>
<dt>When I too long have looked upon your face,
<dt>Wherein for me a brightness unobscured
<dt>Save by the mists of brightness has its place,
<dt>And terrible beauty not to be endured,
<dt>I turn away reluctant from your light,
<dt>And stand irresolute, a mind undone,
<dt>A silly, dazzled thing deprived of a sight
<dt>From having looked too long upon the sun.
<dt>Then is my daily life a narrow room
<dt>In which a little while, uncertainly,
<dt>Surrounded by impenetrable gloom,
<dt>Among familiar things grown strange to me
<dt>Making my way, I pause, and feel, and hark,
<dt>Till I become accustomed to the dark.

<dt>Nor shall my love avail you in your hour.
<dt>In spite of all my love, you will arise

<dt>With lightning or a sword incessantly--
<dt>Such things have beauty, doubtless; but to me
<dt>Mist, shadow, silence--these are lovely, too.
<dt>There is no shelter in you anywhere;
<dt>Rhythmic intolerable, your burning rays
<dt>Trample upon me, withering my breath;
<dt>I will be gone, and rid of you, I swear:
