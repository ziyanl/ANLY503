<p>
<dt>Spirit of mine that soon must venturous spread
<dt>Through voids unknown thy feeble, fluttering plumes,
<dt>Hast thou no fear to wing those endless glooms?
<dt>No apprehension nor misgivings dread?
<dt>Those realms unfathomed of the speechless dead,
<dt>Which never gleam of eldest star illumes--
<dt>Lethean canyons that the Soul entombs--
<dt>Art thou not awed such sombre vasts to tread?
<dt>My Soul replied: "Wisdom hath made all things--
<dt>Life and the end of life, He gives to thee.
<dt>Down Death's worn path the mightiest still have trod.
<dt>Where laurelled poets and anointed Kings
<dt>Have gone for ages, it is good to be--
<dt>Rest thou contented with the will of God."

<a name=020></a><h2>The Flight</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Upon a cloud among the stars we stood:
<dt>The angel raised his hand, and looked, and said,
<dt>"Which world of all yon starry myriad
<dt>Shall we make wing to?" The still solitude
<dt>Became a harp whereon his voice and mood
<dt>Made spheral music round his haloed head.
<dt>I spoke--for then I had not long been dead--
<dt>"Let me look round upon the wastes, and brood
<dt>A moment on these orbs ere I decide. . . 
<dt>What is yon lower star that beauteous shines,
<dt>And with soft splendor now incarnadines
<dt>Our wings?--There would I go, and there abide."
<dt>Then he, as one who some child's thought divines:
<dt>"That is that world where yesternight you died."
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Seostris</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sole Lord of Lords and very King of Kings,
<dt>He sits within the desert, carved in stone;
<dt>Inscrutable, colossal, and alone,
<dt>And ancienter than memory of things.
<dt>Graved on his front the sacred beetle clings;
<dt>Disdain sits on his lips; and in a frown
<dt>Scorn lives upon his forehead for a crown.
<dt>The affrighted ostrich dares not dust her wings
<dt>Anear this Presence. The long caravan's 
<dt>Dazed camels pause, and mute the Bedouins stare.
<dt>This symbol of past power more than man's
<dt>Presages doom. Kings look--and Kings despair:
<dt>The sceptres tremble in their jeweled hands
<dt>And dark thrones totter in the baleful air!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>On the Twilight Headland--Theseus and Ariadne</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Dear Love, lean nearer--let your finger-tips
<dt>Reach till they touch the rose within my palm.
<dt>Through the hushed dusk I feel the fragrant balm
<dt>Of your faint breathing as the tired breast dips
<dt>And rises, drowsful as a bee that sips
<dt>Honey too avid from the numbing flowers. . . 
<dt>Close the sad eyes, and for one little hour
<dt>Let slumber soothe the dear, leave-taking lips.
<dt>Ah, sweet! were it not better for each heart
<dt>Before the cruel years achieve their will--
<dt>For us, who must irrevocably part,
<dt>To pass the lintel of the door of Death
<dt>Lip touching lip, I breathing faintly still
<dt>The poignant sweetness of your fading breath?
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The Evening Comes</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The evening comes: the boatman lifts the net,
<dt>Poles his canoe and leaves it on the shore;
<dt>So low the stream he does not use the oar;
<dt>The umber rocks rise like a parapet
<dt>Up through the purple and the violet,
<dt>And the faint-heard and never-ending roar
<dt>Of moving waters lessens more and more,
<dt>While each vague object looms a silhouette.
<dt>The light is going; but low overhead
<dt>Poises the glory of the evening star;
<dt>The fisher, silent on the rocky bar,
<dt>Drops a still line in pools of fading red;
<dt>And in the sky, where all the day lies dead,
<dt>Slowly the golden crescent sinks afar.
