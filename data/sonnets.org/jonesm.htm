<h2>Paradise Regained</h2>
<p>
<dt>The circling hills of woods and clouds snow-white
<dt>Held, in the golden hour of eventide,
<dt>The lake by which I walked, and seemed to hide
<dt>From view a world yet lovelier, whose light
<dt>Streamed up behind their heights and made them glow,
<dt>As wrapped in purest flame, and flung on high
<dt>Bright flakes of glory 'gainst the pale blue sky
<dt>Which bridged with paths of light the lake below.
<dt>I felt sweet music, that I could not hear,
<dt>I saw a poem that I could not read,
<dt>"What place is this," I cried! Lo, at my need,
<dt>Two lovers passed,--"<i>'Twas Paradise!</i> for clear
<dt>I saw it shining in his happy eyes,
<dt>I heard it murmur'd in her low replies.
