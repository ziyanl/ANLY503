<p>
<dt>After long days of dull perpetual rain,
<dt>And from gray skies, the sun at last shines bright,
<dt>And all the sparkling trees are glad with light,
<dt>And all the happy world laughs out again;
<dt>The sorrow is forgotten, past the pain;
<dt>For Nature has no memory, feels the blight
<dt>Of no regret, nor mars the day's delight
<dt>With idle fears and hopes and longings vain.
<p>
<dt>Ah me! it is not so with us; the ghost
<dt>Of vanished joys pursues us everywhere;
<dt>We live as much in all that we have lost
<dt>As what we own; no present is so fair
<dt>That the best moment's sunlight is not crossed
<dt>By shadowy shapes of hope, and fear, and care.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Human Life</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>We are pursued by Fate; nothing on earth
<dt>Flowers into satisfaction; on the skirt
<dt>Of all temptation, hidden yet alert,
<dt>Hangs disappointment ready to spring forth
<dt>And jar with discord the clear song of mirth;
<dt>Even our best pleasure has the sting of hurt,
<dt>And prayers and tears are futile to avert
<dt>The Nemesis that haunts us from our birth.
<p>
<dt>Oh! what avail our struggles, who are caught
<dt>In Fate's inextricable web! In vain
<dt>Through the dark future our exhausted thought
<dt>Seeks for a resting-place secure from pain;
<dt>Our Present crumbles 'neath us while we laugh,
<dt>Our Past has but a sigh for epitaph.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Little We Know What Secret Influence</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Little we know what secret influence
<dt>A word, a glance, a casual tone may bring,
<dt>That, like the wind's breath on a chorded string,
<dt>May thrill the memory, touch the inner sense,
<dt>And waken dreams that come we know not whence;
<dt>Or like the light touch of a bird's swift wing,
<dt>The lake's still face a moment visiting,
<dt>Leave pulsing rings, when he has vanished thence.
<dt>You looked into my eyes an instant's space,
<dt>And all the boundaries of time and place
<dt>Broke down, and far into a world beyond
<dt>Of buried hopes and dreams my soul had sight,
<dt>Where dim desires long lost, and memories fond
<dt>Rose in a soft mirage of tender light.
