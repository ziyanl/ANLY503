<p>
<dt>I saw Time in his workshop carving faces;
<dt>Scattered around his tools lay, blunting griefs,
<dt>Sharp cares that cut out deeply in reliefs
<dt>Of light and shade; sorrows that smooth the traces
<dt>Of what were smiles. Nor yet without fresh graces
<dt>His handiwork, for ofttimes rough were ground
<dt>And polished, oft the pinched made smooth and round;
<dt>The calm look, too, the impetuous fire replaces.
<dt>Long time I stood and watched; with hideous grin
<dt>He took each heedless face between his knees,
<dt>And graved and scarred and bleached with boiling tears.
<dt>I wondering turned to go, when, lo! my skin
<dt>Feels crumpled, and in glass my own face sees
<dt>Itself all changed, scarred, careworn, white with years.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>At Nightfall</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O little hands, long vanished in the night--
<dt>Sweet fairy hands that were my treasure here--
<dt>My heart is full of music from some sphere,
<dt>Where ye make melody for God's delight.
<dt>Though autumn clouds obscure the starry height,
<dt>And winds are noisy and the land is drear,
<dt>In this blank room I feel my lost love near,
<dt>And hear you playing--hands so small and white.
<dt>The shadowy organ sings its songs again,
<dt>The dead years turn to music at its voice,
<dt>And all the dreams come back my brain did store.
<dt>Once more, dear hands, ye soothe me in my pain,
<dt>Once more your music makes my heart rejoice--
<dt>God speed the day we clasp for evermore!

<a name=030></a><h2>The Laurentians</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>These mountains reign alone, they do not share
<dt>The transitory life of woods and streams;
<dt>Wrapt in the deep solemnity of dreams,
<dt>They drain the sunshine of the upper air.
<dt>Beneath their peaks, the huge clouds, here and there,
<dt>Take counsel of the wind, which all night screams
<dt>Through grey, burnt forests where the moonlight beams
<dt>On hidden lakes, and rocks worn smooth and bare.
<p>
<dt>These mountains once, throned in some primal sea,
<dt>Shook half the world with thunder, and the sun
<dt>Pierced not the gloom that clung about their crest;
<dt>Now with sealed lips, toilers from toil set free,
<dt>Unvexed by fate, the part they played being done,
<dt>They watch and wait in venerable rest.
