<h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>Mother of soldiers! once there was a time
<dt>When your sons' swords won fame in many a clime;
<dt>When Europe press'd on France, they fought alone
<dt>For her, and served her better than their own!
<dt>Those were the days your exiles made their fame
<dt>By gallant deeds which put our age to shame--
<dt>Those were the days Cremona city, saved,
<dt>Stood to attest what Irish valor braved!
<dt>When England's chivalry, sore wounded fled
<dt>Before the stormy charge O'Brien led--
<dt>When travellers saw in Ypres' coir display'd
<dt>The trophies of your song-renown'd brigade!
<dt>Mother of soldiers! France was proud to see
<dt>Your shamrock then twined with the <i>fleur de lis!</i>
<p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>Mother of soldiers! in the cause of Spain
<dt>The Moors in Oran's trench by them were slain;
<dt>For full an hundred years their fatal steel
<dt>Has charged beside the lances of Castile.
<dt>Carb'ry's, Tyrconnell's, Breffny's exiled lords
<dt>To Spain and glory gave their gallant swords;
<dt>And Spain, of honor jealous, gave them place
<dt>Before her native sons in glory's race;
<dt>Her noblest laurels graced your soldiers' head,
<dt>Her dearest daughters shared your soldiers' bed;
<dt>In danger's hour she call'd them to the front,
<dt>And gave to them the praise who bore the brunt:
<dt>Mother of soldiers! Spain to-day will be
<dt>A willing witness for thy sons and thee!
<p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
<dt>Mother of soldiers! on the Volga's banks
<dt>Your practised leaders form'd the Russian ranks;
<dt>And fallen Limerick gave the chiefs to lead
<dt>The hosts who triumph'd o'er the famous Swede.
<dt>That time even Austria gave them host on host,
<dt>The ruling <i>baton</i>, and the perilous post--
<dt>Buda, Belgrade, Prague, Deva--every trust
<dt>That man could earn, and found them bold as just.
<dt>Velettri, Zorndorff, Dantzic, still can tell
<dt>How Austria's Irish soldiers fought and fell,
<dt>And how the ruling skill that led them on
<dt>To conquer was supplied by your own son!
<dt>Mother of soldiers! while these trophies last,
<dt>You're safe against the sland'rers of the past!
<p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
<dt>Mother of exiles! from your soil to-day
<dt>New myriads are destroy'd or swept away;
<dt>The crowded graveyards grow no longer green,
<dt>The daily dead have scanty space, I ween;
<dt>The groaning ships, freighted with want and grief,
<dt>Entomb in every wave a fugitive;
<dt>The sword no more an Irish weapon is--
<dt>The spirit of the land no longer lives;
<dt>Mother! 'twas kill'd before the famine came--
<dt>The stubble was prepared to meet the flame;
<dt>All manly souls were from their bodies torn,
<dt>And what avails it if the bodies burn?
<dt>Mother of soldiers! may we hope to be
<dt>Yet fit to strike for vengeance and for thee!

<p>
<dt>Not of the mighty! not of the world's friends
<dt>Have I aspired to speak within these leaves;
<dt>These best befit their joyful kindred pens--
<dt>My path lies where a broken people grieves;
<dt>By the Ohio, on the Yuba's banks,
<dt>As night displays her standard to their eyes,
<dt>Alone, in tears, or gather'd in sad ranks,
<dt>Stirring the brooding air with woful sighs,
<dt>I see them sit: I hear their mingled speech,
<dt>Gaelic or Saxon, but all from the heart;
<dt>"Home!" is the word that sways the soul of each--
<dt>A word beyond the embellishments of art:
<dt>Yet of this theme I feebly seek to sing,
<dt>And to my banish'd kin a book of "Home" I bring.
<p>*This appears to have been intended by the author for the dedication of an epic he was writing, called "The Emigrants."--ED.

<p>
<dt>I have a sea-going spirit haunts my sleep,
<dt>Not a sad spirit wearisome to follow,
<dt>Less like a tenant of the mystic deep
<dt>Than the good fairy of the hazel hollow;
<dt>Full often at the midwatch of the night
<dt>I see departing in his silver bark
<dt>This spirit, steering toward an Eastern light,
<dt>Calling me to him from the Western dark.
<dt>"Spirit!" I ask, "say, whither bound away?"
<dt>"Unto the old Hesperides!" he cries.
<dt>"Oh, Spirit, take me in thy bark, I pray."
<dt>"For thee I came, " he joyfully replies;
<dt>"Exile! no longer shalt thou absent mourn,
<dt>For I the Spirit am men call--RETURN."
