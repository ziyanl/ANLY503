<a name=001></a><h2>I.  "Poet! If on a Lasting Fame Be Bent"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Poet! if on a lasting fame be bent
<dt>Thy unperturbing hopes, thou will not roam
<dt>Too far from thine own happy heart and home;
<dt>Cling to the lowly earth, and be content!
<dt>So shall thy name be dear to many a heart;
<dt>So shall the noblest truths by thee be taught;
<dt>The flower and fruit of wholesome human thought
<dt>Bless the sweet labors of thy gentle art.
<dt>The brightest stars are nearest to the earth,
<dt>And we may track the mighty sun above,
<dt>Even by the shadow of a slender flower.
<dt>Always, O bard, humility is power!
<dt>And thou mayst draw from matters of the hearth
<dt>Truths wide as nations, and as deep as love.  
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>II.  "Most Men Know Love But as a Part of Life"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Most men know love but as a part of life;
<dt>They hide it in some corner of the breast,
<dt>Even from themselves; and only when they rest
<dt>In the brief pauses of that daily strife,
<dt>Wherewith the world might else be not so rife,
<dt>They draw it forth (as one draws forth a toy
<dt>To soothe some ardent, kiss-exacting boy)
<dt>And hold it up to sister, child, or wife.
<dt>Ah me! why may not love and life be one?
<dt>Why walk we thus alone, when by our side,
<dt>Love, like a visible God, might be our guide?
<dt>How would the marts grow noble! and the street,
<dt>Worn like a dungeon-floor by weary feet,
<dt>Seem then a golden court-way of the Sun! 
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>III.  "Life Ever Seems as from Its Present Site"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Life ever seems as from its present site
<dt>It aimed to lure us.  Mountains of the past
<dt>It melts, with all their crags and caverns vast,
<dt>Into a purple cloud!  Across the night
<dt>Which hides what is to be, it shoots a light
<dt>All rosy with the yet unrisen dawn.
<dt>Not the near daisies, but yon distant height
<dt>Attracts us, lying on this emerald lawn.
<dt>And always, be the landscape what it may --
<dt>Blue, misty hill or sweep of glimmering plain --
<dt>It is the eye's endeavor still to gain
<dt>The fine, faint limit of the bounding day.
<dt>God, haply, in this mystic mode, would fain
<dt>Hint of a happier home, far, far away!  
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>IV.  "They Dub Thee Idler, Smiling Sneeringly"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>They dub thee idler, smiling sneeringly,
<dt>And why? because, forsooth, so many moons,
<dt>Here dwelling voiceless by the voiceful sea,
<dt>Thou hast not set thy thoughts to paltry tunes
<dt>In song or sonnet.  Them these golden noons
<dt>Oppress not with their beauty; they could prate,
<dt>Even while a prophet read the solemn runes
<dt>On which is hanging some imperial fate.
<dt>How know they, these good gossips, what to thee
<dt>The ocean and its wanderers may have brought?
<dt>How know they, in their busy vacancy,
<dt>With what far aim thy spirit may be fraught?
<dt>Or that thou dost not bow thee silently
<dt>Before some great unutterable thought?   
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>V.  "Some Truths There Be Are Better Left Unsaid"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Some truths there be are better left unsaid;
<dt>Much is there that we may not speak unblamed.
<dt>On words, as wings, how many joys have fled!
<dt>The jealous fairies love not to be named.
<dt>There is an old-world tale of one whose bed
<dt>A genius graced, to all, save him, unknown;
<dt>One day the secret passed his lips, and sped
<dt>As secrets speed -- thenceforth he slept alone.
<dt>Too much, oh! far too much is told in books;
<dt>Too broad a daylight wraps us all and each.
<dt>Ah! it is well that, deeper than our looks,
<dt>Some secrets lie beyond conjecture's reach.
<dt>Ah! it is well that in the soul are nooks
<dt>That will not open to the keys of speech.  
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>VI. "I Scarcely Grieve, O Nature! at the Lot"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I scarcely grieve, O Nature! at the lot
<dt>That pent my life within a city's bounds,
<dt>And shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds.
<dt>Perhaps I had not learned, if some lone cot
<dt>Had nursed a dreamy childhood, what the mart
<dt>Taught me amid its turmoil; so my youth
<dt>Had missed full many a stern but wholesome truth.
<dt>Here, too, O Nature! in this haunt of Art,
<dt>Thy power is on me, and I own thy thrall.
<dt>There is no unimpressive spot on earth!
<dt>The beauty of the stars is over all,
<dt>And Day and Darkness visit every hearth.
<dt>Clouds do not scorn us:  yonder factory's smoke
<dt>Looked like a golden mist when morning broke. 
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>VII. "Grief Dies Like Joy; the Tears Upon My Cheek"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Grief dies like joy; the tears upon my cheek
<dt>Will disappear like dew.  Dear God! I know
<dt>Thy kindly Providence hath made it so,
<dt>And thank thee for the law.  I am too weak
<dt>To make a friend of Sorrow, or to wear,
<dt>With that dark angel ever by my side
<dt>(Though to thy heaven there be no better guide),
<dt>A front of manly calm.  Yet, for I hear
<dt>How woe hath cleansed, how grief can deify,
<dt>So weak a thing it seems that grief should die,
<dt>And love and friendship with it, I could pray,
<dt>That if it might not gloom upon my brow,
<dt>Nor weigh upon my arm as it doth now,
<dt>No grief of mine should ever pass away.
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>VIII. "At Last, Beloved Nature! I Have Met"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>At last, beloved Nature! I have met
<dt>Thee face to face upon thy breezy hills,
<dt>And boldly, where thy inmost bowers are set,
<dt>Gazed on thee naked in thy mountain rills.
<dt>When first I felt thy breath upon my brow,
<dt>Tears of strange ecstasy gushed out like rain,
<dt>And with a longing, passionate as vain,
<dt>I strove to clasp thee.  But, I know not how,
<dt>Always before me didst thou seem to glide;
<dt>And often from one sunny mountain-side,
<dt>Upon the next bright peak I saw thee kneel,
<dt>And heard thy voice upon the billowy blast;
<dt>But, climbing, only reached that shrine to feel
<dt>The shadow of a Presence which had passed.  
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>IX. "I Know Not Why, But All This Weary Day"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I know not why, but all this weary day,
<dt>Suggested by no definite grief or pain,
<dt>Sad fancies have been flitting through my brain;
<dt>Now it has been a vessel losing way,
<dt>Rounding a stormy headland; now a gray
<dt>Dull waste of clouds above a wintry main;
<dt>And then, a banner, drooping in the rain,
<dt>And meadows beaten into bloody clay.
<dt>Strolling at random with this shadowy woe
<dt>At heart, I chanced to wander hither!  Lo!
<dt>A league of desolate marsh-land, with its lush,
<dt>Hot grasses in a noisome, tide-left bed,
<dt>And faint, warm airs, that rustle in the hush,
<dt>Like whispers round the body of the dead!   
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>X. "Were I the Poet-Laureate of the Fairies"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>(Written on a very small sheet of note-paper)</h3>
<p>
<dt>Were I the poet-laureate of the fairies,
<dt>Who in a rose-leaf finds too broad a page;
<dt>Or could I, like your beautiful canaries,
<dt>Sing with free heart and happy, in a cage;
<dt>Perhaps I might within this little space
<dt>(As in some Eastern tale, by magic power,
<dt>A giant is imprisoned in a flower)
<dt>Have told you something with a poet's grace.
<dt>But I need wider limits, ampler scope,
<dt>A world of freedom for a world of passion,
<dt>And even then, the glory of my hope
<dt>Would not be uttered in its stateliest fashion;
<dt>Yet, lady, when fit language shall have told it,
<dt>You'll find one little heart enough to hold it! 
<p>
<a name=011></a><h2>XI. "Which Are the Clouds, and Which the Mountains?  See"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Which are the clouds, and which the mountains?  See,
<dt>They mix and melt together!  Yon blue hill
<dt>Looks fleeting as the vapors which distill
<dt>Their dews upon its summit, while the free
<dt>And far-off clouds, now solid, dark, and still,
<dt>An aspect wear of calm eternity.
<dt>Each seems the other, as our fancies will --
<dt>The cloud a mount, the mount a cloud, and we
<dt>Gaze doubtfully.  So everywhere on earth,
<dt>This foothold where we stand with slipping feet,
<dt>The unsubstantial and substantial meet,
<dt>And we are fooled until made wise by Time.
<dt>Is not the obvious lesson something worth,
<dt>Lady? or have I wov'n an idle rhyme? 
<p>
<a name=012></a><h2>XII. "What Gossamer Lures Thee Now?  What Hope, What Name"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What gossamer lures thee now?  What hope, what name
<dt>Is on thy lips?  What dreams to fruit have grown?
<dt>Thou who hast turned ONE Poet-heart to stone,
<dt>Is thine yet burning with its seraph flame?
<dt>Let me give back a warning of thine own,
<dt>That, falling from thee many moons ago,
<dt>Sank on my soul like the prophetic moan
<dt>Of some young Sibyl shadowing her own woe.
<dt>The words are thine, and will not do thee wrong,
<dt>I only bind their solemn charge to song.
<dt>Thy tread is on a quicksand -- oh! be wise!
<dt>Nor, in the passionate eagerness of youth,
<dt>Mistake thy bosom-serpent's glittering eyes
<dt>For the calm lights of reason and of truth.
<p>
<a name=013></a><h2>XIII. "I Thank You, Kind and Best Beloved Friend"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I thank you, kind and best belov&egrave;d friend,
<dt>With the same thanks one murmurs to a sister,
<dt>When, for some gentle favor, he hath kissed her,
<dt>Less for the gifts than for the love you send,
<dt>Less for the flowers than what the flowers convey,
<dt>If I, indeed, divine their meaning truly,
<dt>And not unto myself ascribe, unduly,
<dt>Things which you neither meant nor wished to say,
<dt>Oh! tell me, is the hope then all misplaced?
<dt>And am I flattered by my own affection?
<dt>But in your beauteous gift, methought I traced
<dt>Something above a short-lived predilection,
<dt>And which, for that I know no dearer name,
<dt>I designate as love, without love's flame. 
<p>
<a name=014></a><h2>XIV. "Are These Wild Thoughts, Thus Fettered in My Rhymes"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Are these wild thoughts, thus fettered in my rhymes,
<dt>Indeed the product of my heart and brain?
<dt>How strange that on my ear the rhythmic strain
<dt>Falls like faint memories of far-off times!
<dt>When did I feel the sorrow, act the part,
<dt>Which I have striv'n to shadow forth in song?
<dt>In what dead century swept that mingled throng
<dt>Of mighty pains and pleasures through my heart?
<dt>Not in the yesterdays of that still life
<dt>Which I have passed so free and far from strife,
<dt>But somewhere in this weary world I know,
<dt>In some strange land, beneath some orient clime,
<dt>I saw or shared a martyrdom sublime,
<dt>And felt a deeper grief than any later woe.  
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Sonnet:  "If I Have Graced No Single Song of Mine"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If I have graced no single song of mine
<dt>With thy sweet name, they all are full of thee;
<dt>Thou art my Muse, my "May", my "Madeline":
<dt>But "Julia"! -- ah! that gentle name to me
<dt>Is something far too sacred for the throng
<dt>Of worldly listeners 'round me.  Yet ev'n now
<dt>I weave a chaplet for thy sinless brow; --
<dt>Wilt thou not wear it?  'T is a fashionable song, --
<dt>I will not say of what, -- but on it I
<dt>Have wreaked heart, mind, my love, my hopes of fame,
<dt>Yet after all it hath no nobler aim
<dt>Than thy dear praise.  Ere many moons pass by,
<dt>When the lost gem is set, the crown complete,
<dt>I'll lay a poet's tribute at thy feet.
