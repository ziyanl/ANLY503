<p>Twice British Prime Minister, in 1868 and 1874--80, and well known as a novelist.   "Lord Beaconsfield, even his most ardent admirers would admit, gave no evidence that he was possessed of the creative faculty in verse; an ardent imagination he undoubtedly had. He wrote, so far as I am aware, only two sonnets, one of which--that on Wellington--certainly deserves a place in any sonnet-anthology. I do not insert it in the body of this book, however, as its composition was fortuitous, and as its author has no broader claim to appear among genuine poets.[!]" (<a href="blibliogr.htm#sharp1">Sharp</a>)

<p>
<dt>Not only that thy puissant arm could bind
<dt>The tyrant of a world; and, conquering Fate,
<dt>Enfranchise Europe, do I deem thee great;
<dt>But that in all thy actions I do find
<dt>Exact propriety: no gusts of mind
<dt>Fitful and wild, but that continuous state
<dt>Of ordered impulse mariners await
<dt>In some benignant and enriching wind,--
<dt>The breath ordained of Nature. Thy calm mien
<dt>Recalls old Rome, as much as thy high deed;
<dt>Duty thine only idol, and serene
<dt>When all are troubled; in the utmost need
<dt>Prescient; thy country's servant ever seen,
<dt>Yet sovereign of thyself, whate'er may speed.
