<p>
<dt>O sweet Queen-city of the golden South,
<dt>Piercing the evening with thy star-lit spires,
<dt>Thou wert a witness when I kissed the mouth
<dt>Of her whose eyes outblazed the skyey fires.
<dt>I saw the parallels of thy long streets,
<dt>With lamps like angels shining all a-row,
<dt>While overhead the empyrean seats
<dt>Of gods were steeped in paradisic glow.
<dt>The Pleiades with rarer fires were tipt,
<dt>Hesper sat throned upon his jewelled chair,
<dt>The belted giant's triple stars were dipt
<dt>In all the splendour of Olympian air,
<dt>On high to bless, the Southern Cross did shine,
<dt>Like that which blazed o'er conquering Constantine.
<p>
