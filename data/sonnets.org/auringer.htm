<h2><a name="vale"></a>The Vale of Spirits</h2>
<p>
<dt>In deep green woods there lies a fairy glade,
<dt>Shut in by tawny hemlocks wild and tall;
<dt>Its floor is made with richest moss, and all
<dt>Its round is steeped in most delicious shade.
<dt>It is a spot for listening silence made.
<dt>Few sounds awake it save the wild bird's call,
<dt>And winds that murmur round its forest wall,
<dt>like instruments at airy distance played.

<p></p><dt>'Tis there a still and stolen guest I lie,        
<dt>And listen to the weird wood-spirits singing:
<dt>I hear their bell-like voices floating nigh,
<dt>From arches green and dewy dingles springing;
<dt>They pass in elfin song and laughter by—
<dt>I hear their clear ha! ha!  In deep dells ringing.

<dt>The share of heavenly light that fell on me.
<dt>Thou art my meat, my drink, my liberty;
<dt>Thou art my garb, thou art my tenement,
<dt>Wherein I hide all night from floods unpent
<dt>From lightnings, winds, and scourgings of the sea.
<dt>       
<dt>
<dt>Oh, thou art strong and lovely as the light,—
<dt>Yea, as the light of morning, strong and sweet!
<dt>Thou art the lover perfect in my sight,

<h3>A&nbsp;REMINISCENCE OF COOPER</h3>
<dt>Blank shadow here.&nbsp; The heights on either hand
<dt>Sparkle with lamps.&nbsp; Around me foams the bold,
<dt>Loud Hudson,—swiftly into darkness rolled.
<dt>Those vanish all, and Memory takes her stand
<dt>In that wild&nbsp;cave among that famous band,
<dt>Girt round by unseen terrors manifold,
<dt>Revealed in that enchanting fiction old,
<dt>Blown hence through many an alien tongue and land.
<dt>        
<dt>
<dt>I see the haughty Uncas, and the wise,
<dt>Grim Sagamore; hear Hawkeye's cheery call;
<dt>The singer's&nbsp;strains, of sacred sounds compact;
<dt>And then I hear the holy hymn arise
<dt>From the sweet&nbsp;Sister's lips; and, borne through 
all,
<dt>The plunge and tremble of the cataract.

<h2><a name="emerson"></a>Emerson - Carlyle</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>One stood upon the morning hills and saw
  <dt>The heavens revealed in symbol and in sign;
  <dt>He read their mystic meanings, line by line,
  <dt>And taught in light the reign of rhythmic law.
  <dt>One in the twilight valleys, pierced with awe,
  <dt>Beheld wan Hope amid great darkness shine—
  <dt>Saw gloom and glory blent without design,
  <dt>And cried against a world of blot and flaw.
  <dt>
  <dt>Sunrise and sunset poise the perfect day:
  <dt>One was the prince of morning fair and free,
  <dt>And one the lord of darkness was, and they
  <dt>Made day and night one round of harmony
  <dt>For they were kings and brothers, and their sway
  <dt>    One law,—one new, divine philosophy.

  <h2><a name="fading"></a>Fading Days</h2>        
  <dt>
Filled with a quiet sadness nigh to tears,        
  <dt>
When tears come fresh from no ungentle spring,        
  <dt>
Beside this stream, whose tongue runs faltering,        
  <dt>
I watch this graceful fading of the year's.        
  <dt>
A breeze shakes all the host of grassy spears,        
  <dt>
Rustling their faded pennants where they cling,        
  <dt>
A brown rust widens round the fairies' ring,        
  <dt>
Pale on each bough a dying grace appears.        
  <dt>
The air is tremulous with hovering fears,        
  <dt>
Each moment some loved charm is taking wing;        
  <dt>
For every pearl that falls from summer's string        
  <dt>
Dies in my breast some song her love endears.        
  <dt>
O autumn, haste! blow fresh through heart and brain        
  <dt>
The riper notes of thy reviving strain!        
  <dt>
              
  <h2><a name="winter"></a>Winter</h2>
  <dt>O Winter!&nbsp; thou art not that haggard Lear,
  <dt>With stormy beard and countenance&nbsp;of woe,
  <dt>Raving amain, or dumbly crouching low,
  <dt>In hoary desolation mocked with fear!
  <dt>To me thou art the white queen of the year,
  <dt>A stately virgin in her robes of snow,
  <dt>With royal lilies crowned, and all aglow
  <dt>With holy charms, and gems celestial clear.
  <dt>Nor dost thou come in barren majesty,—
  <dt>Thou hast thy dower of sunbeams, thrice refined,—
  <dt> Nor songless, but with cheerful minstrelsy,
  <dt>Rung from the singing harpstrings of the wind;
  <dt>And, ah!&nbsp; with such sweet dreams, such visions bright,
  <dt> Of flowers and birds, and love's divine delight!&nbsp;

  <h2><a name="untimely"></a>The Untimely Singer</h2>        
  <dt>A bird with azure breast and beak of gold,
  <dt>A joyous 
  stranger, beautiful and shy,
  <dt>Flown from far groves beneath a summer 
  sky,
  <dt>At morn amid our March woods bare and cold
  <dt>Sang like a 
  spirit.&nbsp; Raptures such as hold
  <dt>The arches charmed, and hush the 
  zephyr's sigh,
  <dt>From his enamored throat flowed carelessly
  <dt>In musical low 
  warblings manifold.
  <dt>At length he ceased, with arch head bent aside,
  <dt>And 
  listened long! but from the woodlands bare
  <dt>No cheering voice of melody 
  replied,—
  <dt>Only a faint call from the fields of air;
  <dt>Swiftly he 
  rose, and as the echo died
  <dt>Fled to the open heavens, and warbled there.</dt></dl>

  <dt> Of billows plunging on the stubborn rocks        
  <dt>That pillar the ancient gateway to the sea;        
  <dt>And there comes o'er me, swift, resistless, free,        
  <dt>
Again that old fierce soul of storm and flood,        
  <dt>With fire and joy exultant in the blood,        
  <dt>  Erewhile through stormy years my destiny!        
  <dt>               
  <dt>That strong voice of the sea, prophetic, great,        
  <dt>
How shall the weak of soul resist its call,        
  <dt>
Having once loved it?&nbsp; 'Tis the voice of fate,        
  <dt> Swifter than tongue of siren to enthrall,        
  <dt>Such sway hath mighty nature o'er us still,

His visible hand redeemed it from the sea,

He succored it most swiftly in its need;

 A space for souls ayearn for liberty

With
 nature for their portion which should be.

There         
is a kingdom in a rugged land;       

<dt>         
It lies between a mountain and&nbsp;a sea;       

<dt>         
A torrent roaring down in headlong glee       

<dt>         
Divides it from a forest's ancient stand,       

<dt>         
And         
in its narrow bounds by nature planned       

<dt>         
 A happy monarch reigns in majesty;       

<dt>         
Though small         
his realm and few his subjects be,       

<dt>         
 Supremest powers obey his mild command;       

<dt>         
And I, a pilgrim from a&nbsp;land forlorn,       

<dt>         
Find shelter&nbsp;there, and rest for weary feet,       

<dt>         
Welcome from fiery toil and desert heat       

<dt>         
To         
genial feasts of royal wine and corn,       

<dt>         
The         
king and I together sit at meat,       

<dt>         
And         
drink deep draughts from friendship's holy horn.       

<dt>
<h2><a name="day"></a>A Day and a Friend</h2>         
             

<dt>         
We sat         
upon the shore, my friend and I;       

<dt>         
The         
lake lay rocking in the morning shine,       

<dt>         
Odors of         
gum were round us, and a pine       

<dt>         
Played music while the waves danced, ceaselessly.       

<dt>         
Joy of         
wild woods and waters and blue sky       

<dt>         
Flowed through our spirits like celestial wine;       

<dt>         
We         
talked of poet's hopes and thoughts divine,       

<dt>         
And         
he was generous and I was shy.       

<dt>         
O         
golden heart of all that golden day,       

<dt>         
Wise         
friend!&nbsp; so kind to my reluctant thought;       

<dt>         
So         
gentle with the grace that went astray       

<dt>         
Through stammering speech and woodland ways untaught!       

<dt>         
He read me         
by the things I dared not say,       

<dt>         
And         
loved&nbsp;me for the trust that doubted naught.       

<dt>         
             

<dt>
<h2><a name="slayer"></a>The Slayer</h2>         
             

<dt>         
 Ah, Poesy!&nbsp; thou glorious, deadly thing,       

<dt>         
Fair to create and merciless to slay,       

<dt>         
What have we         
done to thee, that day by day       

<dt>         
 Thou wearest us with fruitless suffering?       

<dt>         
Is it         
for thine own glory thou dost wring       

<dt>         
These souls         
with pangs that waste our hearts away,       

<dt>         
This fairest         
web of life to fret and fray,       

<dt>         
Weaving thereof our grave-clothes while we sing?       

<dt>         
Thou art like         
Love, that wastes us in our spring,—       

<dt>         
Or art         
thou&nbsp;Love's own self, though grown less gay,       

<dt>         
That in         
this guise dost lead us still astray       

<dt>         
And cheat         
us with the glitter of a wing?       

<dt>         
I know         
not; only when I look I see       

<dt>         
Toil         
paid with pain and faith with mockery.       

<dt>         
 &nbsp;
