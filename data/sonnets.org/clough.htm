<p>
<dt>Whence comest thou, shady lane? and why and how?
<dt>Thou, where with idle heart ten years ago
<dt>I wandered and with childhood's paces slow,
<dt>So long unthought of, and remembered now.
<dt>Again in vision clear thy pathwayed side
<dt>I tread, and view thy orchard plots again
<dt>With yellow fruitage hung,--and glimmering grain
<dt>Standing or shocked through the thick hedge espied.
<p>
<dt>This hot still noon of August brings the sight;
<dt>This quelling silence as of eve or night,
<dt>Wherein earth (feeling as a mother will
<dt>After her travail's latest bitterest throes)
<dt>Looks up, so seemeth it one half repose,
<dt>One half in effort, straining, suffering still.
<p>
<h1>On the Thought of Death</h1>

<p>
<dt>If it is thou whose casual hand withdraws
<dt>What it at first as casually did make,
<dt>Say what amount of ages it will take,
<dt>With tardy rare concurrences of laws
<dt>And subtle multiplicities of cause,
<dt>The thing they once had made us to remake;
<dt>May hopes dead slumbering dare to reawake
<dt>Even after utmost interval of pause,
<dt>What revolutions must have passed before
<dt>The great celestial cycles shall restore
<dt>The starry sign whose present hour is gone;
<dt>What worse than dubious chances interpose,
<dt>With cloud and sunny gleam to recompose
<dt>The skiey picture we had gazed upon.

<dt>That children in their loveliness should die
<dt>Before the dawning beauty, which we know
<dt>Cannot remain, has yet begun to go;
<dt>That when a certain period has passed by,
<dt>People of genius and of faculty,
<dt>Leaving behind them some result to show
<dt>Having performed some function, should forgo
<dt>The task which younger hands can better ply,
<dt>Appears entirely natural.

<dt>Whose perfectness did not at all consist
<dt>In things towards forming which time can have done
<dt>Anything--whose sole office was to exist--
<dt>Should suddenly dissolve and cease to be
<dt>Is the extreme of all perplexity.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>"Yes, I have lied, and so must walk my way,"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Yes, I have lied, and so must walk my way,
<dt>Bearing the liar's curse upon my head;
<dt>Letting my weak and sickly heart be fed
<dt>On food which does the present craving stay,
<dt>But may be clean-denied me e'en today,
<dt>And though 'twere certain, yet were ought but bread;
<dt>Letting--for so they say, it seems, I said,
<dt>And I am all too weak to disobey!
<dt>Therefore for me sweet Nature's scenes reveal not
<dt>Their charm; sweet Music greets me and I feel not;
<dt>Sweet eyes pass off me uninspired; yea, more,
<dt>The golden tide of opportunity
<dt>Flows wafting-in friendships and better,--I
<dt>Unseeing, listless, pace along the shore.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>"Here am I yet, another twelvemonth spent"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Here am I yet, another twelvemonth spent,
<dt>One-third departed of the mortal span,
<dt>Carrying on the child into the man,
<dt>Nothing into reality. Sails rent,
<dt>And rudder broken,--reason impotent,--
<dt>Affections all unfixed; so forth I fare
<dt>On the mid seas unheedingly, so dare
<dt>To do and to be done by, well content.
<dt>So was it from the first, so is it yet;
<dt>Yea, the first kiss that by these lips was set
<dt>On any human lips, methinks was sin--
<dt>Sin, cowardice, and falsehood; for the will
<dt>Into a deed e'en then advanced, wherein
<dt>God, unidentified, was thought-of still.

<p>
<dt>That there are better things within the womb
<dt>Of Nature than to our unworthy view
<dt>She grants for a possession, may be true:
<dt>The cycle of the birthplace and the tomb
<dt>Fulfils at least the order and the doom
<dt>Of her, that has not ordinance to do
<dt>More than to withdraw and to renew,
<dt>To show one moment and the next resume:
<dt>The law that we return from whence we came
<dt>May for the flowers, beasts, and most men remain;
<dt>If for ourselves, we [ask] not nor complain:
<dt>But for a being that demands the name
<dt>We highest deem--a Person and a Soul
<dt>It troubles us if this should be the whole.

<p>
<dt>To see the rich autumnal tints depart,
<dt>And view the fading of the roseate glow
<dt>That veils some Alpine altitude of snow,
<dt>To hear some mighty masterpiece of art
<dt>Lost or destroyed, may to the adult heart,
<dt>Impatient of the transitory show
<dt>Of lovelinesses that but come and go,
<dt>A positive strange thankfulness impart.
<dt>When human pure perfections disappear,
<dt>Not at the first, but at some later day,
<dt>The buoyancy of such reaction may
<dt>With strong assurance conquer blank dismay.

<p>
<dt>But if, as (not by what the soul desired
<dt>Swayed in the judgment) wisest men have thought,
<dt>And (furnishing the evidence it sought)
<dt>Man's heart hath ever fervently required,
<dt>And story, for that reason deemed inspired,
<dt>To every clime, in every age, hath taught;
<dt>If in this human complex there be aught
<dt>Not lost in death, as not in birth acquired,
<dt>O then, though cold the lips that did convey
<dt>Rich freights of meaning, dead each living sphere
<dt>Where thought abode and fancy loved to play,
<dt>Thou, yet we think, somewhere somehow still art,
<dt>And satisfied with that the patient heart
<dt>The where and how doth not desire to hear.

<p>
<dt>If it is thou whose casual hand withdraws
<dt>What it at first as casually did make,
<dt>Say what amount of ages it will take
<dt>With tardy rare concurrences of laws,
<dt>And subtle multiplicities of cause,
<dt>The thing they once had made us to remake;
<dt>May hopes dead-slumbering dare to reawake,
<dt>E'en after utmost interval of pause?
<dt>What revolutions must have passed, before
<dt>The great celestial cycles shall restore
<dt>The starry [sign] whose present hour is gone;
<dt>What worse than dubious chances interpose,
<dt>With cloud and sunny gleam to recompose
<dt>The skiey picture we had gazed upon.

<p>
<dt>But whether in the uncoloured light of truth
<dt>This inward strong assurance be, indeed,
<dt>More than the self-willed arbitrary creed,
<dt>Manhood's inheritor to the dream of youth;
<dt>Whether to shut out fact because forsooth
<dt>To live were insupportable unfreed,
<dt>Be not or be the service of untruth;
<dt>Whether this vital confidence be more
<dt>Than his, who upon death's immediate brink
<dt>Knowing, perforce determines to ignore;
<dt>Or than the bird's, that when the hunter comes
<dt>Burying her eyesight, can forget her fear;
<dt>Who about this shall tell us what to think?
<dt>
<p>
<a name=107></a><h2>VII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Shall I decide it by a random shot?
<dt>Our happy hopes, so happy and so good,
<dt>Are not mere idle motions of the blood;
<dt>And when they seem most baseless, most are not.
<dt>A seed there must have been [up]on the spot
<dt>Where the flowers grow, without it ne'er they could.
<dt>The confidence of growth least understood
<dt>Of some deep intuition was begot.
<dt>What if despair and hope alike be true?
<dt>The heart, 'tis manifest, is free to do
<dt>Whichever Nature and itself suggest;
<dt>And always 'tis a fact that we are here;
<dt>And with being here, doth palsy-giving fear,
<dt>Whoe'er can ask, or hope accord the best?
