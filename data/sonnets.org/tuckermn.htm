<a name=007></a><h2>"Dank fens of cedar..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Dank fens of cedar, hemlock-branches gray
<dt>With tress and trail of mosses wringing-wet;
<dt>Beds of the black pitch-pine in dead leaves set
<dt>Whose wasted red has wasted to white away;
<dt>Remnants of rain and droppings of decay,--
<dt>Why hold ye so my heart, nor dimly let
<dt>Through your deep leaves the light of yesterday,
<dt>The faded glimmer of a sunshine set?
<dt>Is it that in your darkness, shut from strife,
<dt>The bread of tears becomes the bread of life?
<dt>Far from the roar of day, beneath your boughs
<dt>Fresh griefs beat tranquilly, and loves and vows
<dt>Grow green in your gray shadows, dearer far
<dt>Even than all lovely lights, and roses are?
</p>
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>"An upper chamber in a darkened house"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>An upper chamber in a darkened house,
<dt>Where, ere his footsteps reached ripe manhood's brink,
<dt>Terror and anguish were his cup to drink,--
<dt>I cannot rid the thought, nor hold it close;
<dt>But dimly dream upon that man alone;--
<dt>Now though the autumn clouds most softly pass;
<dt>The cricket chides beneath the doorstep stone,
<dt>And greener than the season grows the grass.
<dt>Nor can I drop my lids, nor shade my brows,
<dt>But there he stands beside the lifted sash;
<dt>And with a swooning of the heart, I think
<dt>Where the black shingles slope to meet the boughs,
<dt>And--shattered on the roof like smallest snows--
<dt>The tiny petals of the mountain-ash.
</p>
<p>
<a name=107></a><h2>"His heart was in his garden..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>His heart was in his garden; but his brain
<dt>Wandered at will among the fiery stars:
<dt>Bards, heroes, prophets, Homers, Hamilcars,
<dt>With many angels, stood, his eye to gain;
<dt>The devils, too, were his familiars.
<dt>And yet the cunning florist held his eyes
<dt>Close to the ground,--a tulip-bulb his prize,--
<dt>And talked of tan and bone-dust, cutworms, grubs,
<dt>As though all Nature held no higher strain;
<dt>Or, if he spoke of Art, he made the theme
<dt>Flow through box-borders, turf, and flower-tubs;
<dt>Or, like a garden-engine's, steered the stream,--
<dt>Now spouted rainbows to the silent skies;
<dt>Now kept it flat, and raked the walks and shrubs.
</p>
<p>
<a name=116></a><h2>"Under the mountain..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Under the mountain, as when first I knew
<dt>Its low dark roof, and chimney creeper-twined,
<dt>The red house stands; and yet my footsteps find
<dt>Vague in the walks, waste balm and fever few.
<dt>But they are gone: no soft-eyed sisters trip
<dt>Across the porch or lintels; where, behind,
<dt>The mother sat,--sat knitting with pursed lip.
<dt>The house stands vacant in its green recess,
<dt>Absent of beauty as a broken heart;
<dt>The wild rain enters, and the sunset wind
<dt>Sighs in the chambers of their loveliness,
<dt>Or shakes the pane; and in the silent noons,
<dt>The glass falls from the window, part by part,
<dt>And ringeth faintly in the grassy stones.
</p>

<a name=204></a><h2>"Thin little leaves of wood fern, ribbed and toothed"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thin little leaves of wood fern, ribbed and toothed
<dt>Long curved sail needles of the green pitch pine,
<dt>With common sandgrass, skirt the horizon line,
<dt>And over these the incorruptible blue!
<dt>Here let me gently lie and softly view
<dt>All world asperities, lightly touched and smoothed
<dt>As by his gracious hand, the great Bestower.
<dt>What though the year be late? some colors run
<dt>Yet through the dry, some links of melody
<dt>Still let me be, by such, assuaged and soothed
<dt>And happier made, as when, our schoolday done,
<dt>We hunted on from flower to frosty flower,
<dt>Tattered and dim, the last red butterfly,
<dt>Or the old grasshopper molasses-mouthed.
</p>
<p>
<a name=210></a><h2>"Sometimes I walk where the deep water dips"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sometimes I walk where the deep water dips
<dt>Against the land. Or on where fancy drives
<dt>I walk and muse aloud, like one who strives
<dt>To tell his half-shaped thought with stumbling lips,
<dt>And view the ocean sea, the ocean ships,
<dt>With joyless heart: still but myself I find
<dt>And restless phantoms of my restless mind:
<dt>Only the moaning of my wandering words,
<dt>Only the wailing of the wheeling plover,
<dt>And this high rock beneath whose base the sea
<dt>Has wormed long caverns, like my tears in me:
<dt>And hard like this I stand, and beaten and blind,
<dt>This desolate rock with lichens rusted over,
<dt>Hoar with salt-sleet and chalkings of the birds.
