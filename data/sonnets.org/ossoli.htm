<h2>Orpheus</h2>
<p>
<dt>Each Orpheus must unto the depths descend,--
<dt>For only thus the poet can be wise;
<dt>Must make the sad Persephone his friend,
<dt>And buried love to second life arise;
<dt>Again his love must lose through too much love,
<dt>Must lose his life by living life too true,
<dt>For what he sought below is passed above,
<dt>Already done is all that he would do;
<dt>Must tune all being with his single lyre,
<dt>Must melt all rocks free from their primal pain,
<dt>Must search all Nature with his one soul's fire,
<dt>Must bind anew all forms in heavenly chain.
<dt>If he already sees what he must do,
<dt>Well may he shade his eyes from the far-shining view.
