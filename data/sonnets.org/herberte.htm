<a name=010></a><h2>Sonnet of Black Beauty</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Black beauty, which above that common light,
<dt>Whose Power can no colours here renew
<dt>But those which darkness can again subdue,
<dt>Do'st still remain unvary'd to the sight,
<p>
<dt>And like an object equal to the view,
<dt>Art neither chang'd with day, nor hid with night
<dt>When all these colours which the world call bright,
<dt>And which old Poetry doth so persue,
<p>
<dt>Are with the night so perished and gone,
<dt>That of their being there remains no mark,
<dt>Thou still abidest so intirely one,
<dt>That we may know thy blackness is a spark
<dt>Of light inaccessible, and alone
<dt>Our darkness which can make us think it dark.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Another Sonnet to Black Itself</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou Black, wherein all colours are compos'd,
<dt>And unto which they all at last return,
<dt>Thou colour of the Sun where it doth burn,
<dt>And shadow, where it cools, in thee is clos'd
<dt>Whatever nature can, or hath dispos'd
<dt>In any other Hue: from thee do rise
<dt>Those tempers and complexions, which disclos'd,
<dt>As parts of thee, do work as mysteries,
<dt>Of that thy hidden power; when thou dost reign
<dt>The characters of fate shine in the Skies,
<dt>And tell us what the Heavens do ordain,
<dt>But when Earth's common light shines to our eyes,
<dt>Thou so retir'st thyself, that thy disdain
<dt>All revelation unto Man denies.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>To Her Face</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Fatal Aspect! that hast an Influence
<dt>More powerful far than those Immortal Fires
<dt>That but incline the Will and move the Sense,
<dt>Which thou alone contrain'st, kindling Desires
<dt>Of such an holy force, as more inspires
<dt>The Soul with Knowledge, than Experience
<dt>Or Revelation can do with all
<dt>Their borrow'd helps: Sacred Astonishment
<dt>Sits on thy Brow, threatning a sudden fall
<dt>To all those Thoughts that are not lowly sent,
<dt>In wonder and amaze, dazling that Eye
<dt>Which on those Mysteries doth rudely gaze,
<dt>Vow'd only unto Love's Divinity:
<dt>Sure <i>Adam</i> sinn'd not in that spotless Face.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>To Her Body</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Regardful Pretence! whose fix'd Majesty
<dt>Darts Admiration on the gazing Look,
<dt>That brings it not: State sits inthron'd in thee,
<dt>Divulging forth her Laws in the fair Book
<dt>Of thy Commandements, which none mistook,
<dt>That ever humbly came therein to see
<dt>Their own unworthiness: Oh! how can I
<dt>Enough admire that Symmetry, exprest
<dt>In new proportions, which doth give the Lie
<dt>To that Arithmetique which hath profest
<dt>All Numbers to be Hers? thy Harmony
<dt>Comes from the Spheres, and there doth prove
<dt>Strange measures so well grac'd, as Majesty
<dt>Itself, like thee would rest, like thee would move.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>To Her Mind</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Exalted Mind! whose Character doth bear
<dt>The first Idea of Perfection, whence
<dt><i>Adam</i>'s came, and stands so, how canst appear
<dt>In words? that only tell what here-
<dt>Tofore hath been; thou need'st as deep a sense
<dt>As prophecy, since there's no difference
<dt>In telling what thou art, and what shall be:
<dt>Then pardon me that Rapture do profess,
<dt>At thy outside, that want, for what I see,
<dt>Description, if here amaz'd I <a href="#999">cesse</a>
<dt>Thus---
<dt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet grant one Question, and no more, crav'd under
<dt>Thy gracious leave, How, if thou would'st express
<dt>Thyself to us, thou should'st be still a wonder?
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Love's End</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thus ends my Love, but this doth grieve me most,
<dt>That so it ends, but that ends too, this yet,
<dt>Besides the Wishes, hopes and time I lost,
<dt>Troubles my mind awhile, that I am set
<dt>Free, worse then denied: I can neither boast
<dt>Choice nor success, as my Case is, nor get
<dt>Pardon from myself; that I loved not
<dt>A better Mistress, or her worse; this Debt
<dt>Only's her due, still, that she be forgot
<dt>Ere chang'd, lest I love none; this done, the taint
<dt>Of foul Inconstancy is clear'd at least
<dt>In me, there only rests but to unpaint
<dt>Her form in my mind, that so dispossest
<dt>It be a Temple, but without a Saint.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>Epitaph of King James</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Here lies King James, who did so propagate
<dt>Unto the World that blest and quiet state
<dt>Wherein his Subjects liv'd, he seem'd to give
<dt>That peace which Christ did leave, and so did live,
<dt>As once that King and Shepherd of his Sheep,
<dt>That whom God saved, here he seem'd to keep,
<dt>Till with that innocent and single heart
<dt>With which he first was crown'd, he did depart
<dt>To better life Great <i>Brittain</i> to lament,
<dt>That Strangers more then thou may yet resent
<dt>The sad effects, and while they feel the harm
<dt>They must endure from the victorious arm
<dt>Of our King Charles, may they so long complain,
<dt>That tears in them force thee to weep again.
