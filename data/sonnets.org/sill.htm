<h2>"Quem Metui Moritura"</h2>
<h3><i>AEneid, iv. 604.</i></h3>
<p>
<dt>What need have I to fear--so soon to die?
<dt>Let me work on, not watch and wait in dread:
<dt>What will it matter, when that I am dead
<dt>That they bore hate or love that near me lie?
<dt>'Tis but a lifetime, and the end is nigh
<dt>At best or worst. Let me lift up my head
<dt>And firmly, as with inner courage, tread
<dt>Mine own appointed way on mandates high.
<dt>Pain could but bring from all its evil  store,
<dt>The close of pain: hate's venom could but kill;
<dt>Repulse, defeat, desertion, could no more,
<dt>Let me have lived my life, not cowered until
<dt>The unhindered and unchastened hour was here.
<dt>So soon--what is there now for me to fear?
