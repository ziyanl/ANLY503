<p>
<dt>What is the lesson I have brought away
<dt>After the moment's palpitating glee?
<dt>What has this pomp of men, this strong array
<dt>Of thousands and ten thousands been to me?
<dt>Did I find nothing but the vision gay,
<dt>The mere phenomenon that all could see?
<dt>Did I feel nothing but the brute display
<dt>Of power,--the show of centred energy?
<p>
<dt>Trembling and humbled, I was taught how hard
<dt>It is for our strait minds at once to scan
<dt>The might of banded numbers, and regard
<dt>The individual soul, the living man;
<dt>To use mechanic multitudes, and yet
<dt>Our common human feelings not forget!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>On a Scene in Tuscany</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What good were it to dim the pleasure glow
<dt>That lights thy cheek, fair girl, in scenes like these,
<dt>By shameful facts and piteous histories?
<dt>While we enjoy, what matters what we know?
<dt>What tender love-sick looks on us below
<dt>Those mountains cast! how courteously the trees
<dt>Raise up their branching heads in chalices
<dt>For the thick vine to fill and overflow!
<p>
<dt>This nature is like thee, all-bright, all-mild;
<dt>If then some self-wise man should say, that here
<dt>Hate, sin, and death held rule for many a year,
<dt>That of this kindliest earth there's not a rood
<dt>But has been saturate with brother's blood,
<dt>Believe him not, believe him not, my child.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Impression on Returning to England</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In just accordance with attentive sight,
<dt>Through airy space and round our planet ball,
<dt>The inorganic world is voiced with light,
<dt>And colours are the words it speaks withal.
<dt>Thus has my eye had glad experience
<dt>Of that most perfect utterance and clear tone
<dt>With which all visible things address the sense,
<dt>In lands retiring from the northern zone.
<p>
<dt>But oh! in what poor language, faintly caught,
<dt>Do the old features of my England greet
<dt>Her stranger-son--how powerless, how unmeet
<dt>For the free vision Italy had taught
<dt>What to expect from nature; I must scan
<dt>Her face, I fear, no more, and look alone to man.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>To Charles Lamb</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thee I would think one of the many wise,
<dt>Who in Eliza's time sat eminent,
<dt>To our now world, as Purgatory, sent
<dt>To teach us what true English poets prize.
<dt>Pasquillant froth and foreign galliardize
<dt>Are none of thine; but, when of gay intent,
<dt>Thou usest staid old English merriment,
<dt>Mannerly mirth, which no one dare despise.
<p>
<dt>The scoffs and girds of our poor critic rout
<dt>Must move thy pity, as amidst their mime,
<dt>Monk of truth's order, from thy memories
<dt>Thou dost updraw sublime simplicities,
<dt>Grand thoughts that never can be wearied out,
<dt>Showing the unreality of time.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>On Revisiting Cambridge</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I have a debt of my heart's own to thee,
<dt>School of my soul, old lime and cloister shade,
<dt>Which I, strange creditor, should grieve to see
<dt>Fully acquitted and exactly paid.
<dt>The first ripe taste of manhood's best delights,
<dt>Knowledge imbibed, while mind and heart agree,
<dt>In sweet belated talk on winter nights,
<dt>With friends whom growing time keeps dear to me,--
<p>
<dt>Such things I owe thee, and not only these:
<dt>I owe thee the far beaconing memories
<dt>Of the young dead, who, having crossed the tide
<dt>Of life where it was narrow, deep, and clear,
<dt>Now cast their brightness from the further side
<dt>On the dark-flowing hours I breast in fear.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Indirect Beauty</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Poet and artist think and care not whether
<dt>Things hold in truth the glory that they show;
<dt>Beauty and beauteous thoughts will go together,
<dt>While to one scene a thousand memories flow;
<dt>Long spirit-strains from one wild note shall grow,
<dt>Magnificent tempests from one cloudy feather,
<dt>From one bright ray the sunset's perfect glow,
<dt>Hymettian thyme-beds from one plant of heather.
<p>
<dt>Into one scene a thousand memories flow!
<dt>Held we but this reflection at our hearts,
<dt>And beauty never past without regard,
<dt>No place would lack illuminated parts,
<dt>And inward grace with outer mingle so,
<dt>That nature should be never dark or hard.
