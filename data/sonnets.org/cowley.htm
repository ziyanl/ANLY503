<dt>Ye jessamines that beneath the lunar ray
<dt>Unfold your virgin robes, your modest grace,
<dt>Imparting odours you denied the day
<dt>Though day's own light condensed adorns your race!
<dt>Ye stars, that quivering midst yon azure sky,
<dt>From forth your circles softened lustre stream,
<dt>And raise towards you calm devotion's eye,
<dt>And seed to lonely love a soothing beam,
<dt>Why cease you now to charm as erst ye did?
<dt>Why free from rapture move I now along?
<dt>Ye scents, ye blooms, ye stars, in vain ye bid
<dt>Your soft enchantments round my senses throng--
<dt>For she is lost who greeted all your powers;
<dt>She breathes no more who loved your pensive hours!
