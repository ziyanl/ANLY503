<p>
<dt>It must have been for one of us, my own,
<dt>To drink this cup and eat this bitter bread.
<dt>Had not my tears upon thy face been shed,
<dt>Thy tears had dropped on mine; if I alone
<dt>Did not walk now, thy spirit would have known
<dt>My loneliness; and did my feet not tread
<dt>This weary path and steep, thy feet had bled
<dt>For mine, and thy mouth had for mine made moan:
<p>
<dt>And so it comforts me, yea, not in vain,
<dt>To think of thine eternity of sleep;
<dt>To know thine eyes are tearless though mine weep:
<dt>And when this cup's last bitterness I drain,
<dt>One thought shall still its primal sweetness keep,--
<dt>Thou hadst the peace and I the undying pain.

<p>
<dt>Is this the sky, and this the very earth
<dt>I had such pleasure in when I was young?
<dt>And can this be the identical sea-song,
<dt>Heard once within the storm-cloud's awful girth,
<dt>When a great cloud from silence burst to birth,
<dt>And winds to whom it seemed I did belong
<dt>Made the keen blood in me run swift and strong
<dt>With irresistible, tempestuous mirth?
<p>
<dt>Are these the forests loved of old so well,
<dt>Where on May nights enchanted music was?
<dt>Are these the fields of soft, delicious grass,
<dt>These the old hills with secret things to tell?
<dt>O my dead youth, was this inevitable,
<dt>That with thy passing, Nature, too, should pass?
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>A Dream</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Here--where last night she came, even she, for whom
<dt>I would so gladly live or lie down dead,
<dt>Came in the likeness of a dream and said
<dt>Some words that thrilled this desolate ghost-thronged room--
<dt>I sit alone now in the absolute gloom.
<dt>Ah! surely on her breast was leaned my head,
<dt>Ah! surely on my mouth her kiss was shed,
<dt>While all my life broke into scent and bloom.
<dt>Give thanks, heart, for thy rootless flower of bliss,
<dt>Nor think the gods severe though thus they seem,
<dt>Though thou hast much to bear and much to miss,
<dt>Whilst thou thy nights and days to be canst deem
<dt>One thing, and that thing veritably this--
<dt>The imperishable memory of a dream.

<h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>A child, with mystic eyes and flowing hair,
<dt>I saw her first, 'mid flowers that shared her grace;
<dt>Though but a boy, I cried, "How fair a face!"
<dt>And, coming nearer, told her she was fair.
<dt>She faintly smiled, yet did not say "Forbear!"
<dt>But seemed to take a pleasure in my praise.
<dt>She led my steps through many a leafy place
<dt>And pointed where shy birds and sweet flowers were.
<p>
<dt>At length we stood upon a brooklet's brink--
<dt>I seem to hear its sources babbling yet--
<dt>She gave me water from her hand to drink,
<dt>The while her eyes upon its flow were set.
<dt>"Thy name?" I asked; she whispered low, "Regret,"
<dt>Then faded as the sun began to sink.
<p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>We met again, as I foresaw we should;
<dt>Youth flooded all my veins, and she had grown
<dt>To woman's height, yet seemed a rose half blown.
<dt>Like sunset clouds that o'er a landscape brood
<dt>Her eyes were, that they might not be withstood,
<dt>And like the wind's voice when it takes the tone
<dt>Of pine trees was her voice. I cried "My own!"
<dt>And kneeling there I worshipped her and wooed.
<p>
<dt>O bitter marriage, though inevitable,
<dt>Ordained by fate, who wrecks or saves our days!
<dt>Lo, the changed bride, no longer fair of face,
<dt>And in her eyes the very fires of hell!
<dt>"Thy name?" I cried; and these words hissing fell--
<dt>"Anguish--and madness comes of my embrace."
<p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
<dt>What thing may be to come I cannot know.
<dt>Her eyes have less of hell in them, meanwhile;
<dt>At times she almost smiles a ghastly smile,
<dt>I have in all things done her bidding so.
<dt>Chill are the rooms wherein no bright fires glow,
<dt>Where no fair picture does the eye beguile;
<dt>Once awful laughter shook the gloomy pile,
<dt>Unholy, riotous shapes went to and fro.
<p>
<dt>There is no sound, now, in the house at all,
<dt>Only outside the wind moans on, alway.
<dt>My Lady Sorrow has no word to say,
<dt>Seems half content; for well she knows her thrall
<dt>Shall not escape from her; that should God call
<dt>She would rise with him at the Judgment Day.
