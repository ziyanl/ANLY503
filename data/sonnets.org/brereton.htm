<p>
<dt>In the grey dawn I lie within my bed
<dt>Still as a frozen lake that pats no more
<dt>With murmurous delight the o'erhanging shore,
<dt>Yet grim thoughts heave obscurely in my head;
<dt>For curtains I have earthern walls, and lead
<dt>Is colder than the woollen garb I wore--
<dt>But oh! that heart of mine is still as sore
<dt>As when I did not know that I was dead.
<dt>I knew her (O my Life!) and she was fair,
<dt>And gave her beauty to the hills and sea,
<dt>The wonder of her voice to leaf and wave.
<dt>The brown earth lies between us; does she care
<dt>That since she cast the first dull clod on me
<dt>My lonely heart is aching in the grave?

<p>
<dt>Gone are the aching want, the unceasing fret,
<dt>Mad flight and moaning over battered wings,
<dt>And self-contempt whose secret penance wrings
<dt>Out of the writhing soul her bloody sweat.
<dt>But use has never taught me to forget
<dt>The glory that the common daylight flings;
<dt>Still in my heart the rebel tocsin rings,
<dt>And still is love my glowing amulet.
<dt>Calm and contented, yet with heart afire
<dt>To fight for ever for the sake of strife,
<dt>I hold the future and the past in fee.
<dt>The time to come brings riper fruit for me
<dt>Who stretch my hands with passionate desire
<dt>And welcome for the green and grey of life.
