<dt>
Severed from sweet Content, my life's sole light;
<dt>
Banished by overweening wit from my desire:
<dt>
This poor acceptance only I require,
<dt>
That though my fault have forced me from thy sight;
<dt>
Yet that thou wouldst (my sorrows to requite)
<dt>
Review these Sonnets, pictures of thy praise;
<dt>
Wherein each woe thy wondrous worth doth raise,
<dt>
Though first thy worth bereft me of delight.
<dt>
See them forsaken: for I them forsooke,
<dt>
Forsaken first of thee, next of my sense;
<dt>
And when thou deignst on their black tears to look
<dt>
Shed not one tear my tears to recompense:
<dt>
But joy in this (though Fates 'gainst me repine)
<dt>
My verse still lives, to witness thee divine.

<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Thine eye the glass where I behold my heart
<dt>
Mine eye the window through the which thine eye
<dt>
May see my heart and there thyself espy
<dt>
In bloody colours how thou painted art.
<p>
<dt>
Thine eye the pile is of a murdering dart,
<dt>
Mine eye the sight thou tak'st thy level by
<dt>
To hit my heart and never shoot'st awry;
<dt>
Mine eye thus helps thine eye to work my smart.
<p>
<dt>
Thyne eye a fire is both in heat and light
<dt>
Mine eye of tears a river doth become.
<dt>
O that the water of mine eye had might
<dt>
To quench the flames that from thyne eye do come
<dt>
Or that the fire that's kindled by thine eye
<dt>
The flowing streams of mine eye doth make dry.

  Of the Sudden Surprising of His Heart, and How Unawares He Was Caught
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Delight in your bright eyes my death did breed
<dt>
As light and glittering weapons babes allure
<dt>
To play with fire and sword and so procure
<dt>
Them to be burnt and hurt ere they take heed.
<P>
<dt>
Thy beauty so hath made me burn and bleed
<dt>
Yet shall my ashes and my blood assure
<dt>
Thy beauty's fame forever to endure
<dt>
For thy fame's life from my death doth proceed.
<P>
<dt>
Because my heart to ashes burn&egrave;d giveth
<dt>
Life to thy fame thou right a Phoenix art
<dt>
And like a Pelican thy beauty liveth
<dt>
By sucking blood out of my breast and heart.
<dt>
Loe why with wonder we may thee compare
<dt>
Unto the Pelican and Phoenix rare.

  An Excuse to His Mistress for Resolving to Love so Worthy a Creature
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Blame not my heart for flying up so high
<dt>
Since thou art cause that it this flight begun
<dt>
For earthly vapors drawn up by the sun
<dt>
Comets become and night-suns in the sky.
<P>
<dt>
My humble heart so with thy heavenly eye
<dt>
Drawn up aloft all low desires doth shun
<dt>
Raise thou me up as thou my heart hast done
<dt>
So during night in heaven remain may I.
<P>
<dt>
Blame not, I say again, my high desire
<dt>
Since of us both the cause thereof depends.
<dt>
In thee doth shine, in me doth burn a fire.
<dt>
Fire draws up others and itself ascends.
<dt>
Thine eye a fire and so draws up my love,
<dt>
My love a fire and so ascends above.

<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Not that thy hand is soft, is sweet, is white,
<dt>
Thy lips sweet roses, breast sweet lily is,
<dt>
That love esteems these three the chiefest bliss
<dt>
Which nature ever made for lips' delight.
<P>
<dt>
But when these three to show their heavenly might
<dt>
Such wonders do, devotion then for this
<dt>
Commandeth us, with humble zeal to kiss
<dt>
Such things as work miracles in our sight.
<P>
<dt>
A lute of senseless wood by nature dumb
<dt>
Touched by thy hand doth speak divinely well
<dt>
And from thy lips and breast sweet tunes do come
<dt>
To my daed heart the which new life do give
<dt>
Of greater wonders heard we never tell
<dt>
Than for the dumb to speak, the dead to live.

<H2>
  Of His Mistress upon Occasion of Her Walking in a Garden
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
My Lady's presence makes the roses red
<dt>
Because to see her lips they blush for shame.
<dt>
The lilies' leaves for envy pale became
<dt>
And her white hands in them this envy bred.
<dt>
<dt>
The marigold abroad the leaves did spread
<dt>
Because the sun's and her power is the same
<dt>
The violet of purple colour came
<dt>
Dyed with the blood she made my heart to shed.
<P>
<dt>
In brief, all flowers from her their virtue take
<dt>
From her sweet breath their sweet smells do proceed
<dt>
The living heat which her eyebeams do make
<dt>
Warmeth the ground and quickneth the seed.
<dt>
The rain wherewith she watereth these flowers
<dt>
Falls from mine eyes which she dissolves in showers.

If nature for her works proud ever were
<dt>
It was for this that she created you.
<dt>
Your sacred head which wisdom doth indue,
<dt>
Is only fit a diadem to wear.
<P>
<dt>
Your lily hand which fairer doth appear
<dt>
Than ever eye beheld in shape and hue
<dt>
Unto no other use by right is due,
<dt>
Except it be a scepter for to bear.
<P>
<dt>
Your cherry lips by nature fram&egrave;d be
<dt>
Hearts to comand: your eye is only fit
<dt>
With his wise looks kingdoms to oversee.
<P>
<dt>
O happy land whose sovereign thou hadst been:
<dt>
But God on earth full bliss will not permit,
<dt>
And this is only cause your are no Queen.

<P>
<dt>
Mine eye with all the deadly sins is fraught.
<dt>
First <I>proud</I>, since it presumed to look so high;
<dt>
A watchman being made stood gazing by,
<dt>
And <I>idle</I>, took no heed till I was caught;
<p>
<dt>
And <I>envious</I> bears envy that my thought
<dt>
Should in his absence be to her so nigh;
<dt>
To kill my heart, mine eye let in her eye,
<dt>
And so consent gave to a <I>murder</I> wrought;
<P>
<dt>
And <I>covetous</I>, it never would remove
<dt>
From her fair hair, gold so doth please his sight;
<dt>
<I>Unchaste</I>, a bawd between my heart and love;
<dt>
A <I>glutton</I> eye, with tears drunk every night:
<dt>
These sins procur&eacute;d have a goddess' ire,
<dt>
Wherefore my heart is damned in love's sweet fire.

<P>
<dt>
Dear to my soul, then leave me not forsaken!
<dt>
Fly not, my heart within thy bosom sleepeth.
<dt>
Even from myself and sense I have betaken
<dt>
Me unto thee for whom my spirit weepeth,
<dt>
And on the shore of that salt teary sea,
<dt>
Couched in a bed of unseen seeming pleasure,
<dt>
Where in imaginary thoughts thy fair self lay;
<dt>
But being waked, robbed of my life's best treasure,
<dt>
I call the heavens, air, earth, and seas to hear
<dt>
My love, my truth, and black disdained estate;
<dt>
Beating the rocks with bellowings of despair,
<dt>
Which still with plaints my words reverberate;
<dt>
Sighing, Alas, what shall become of me?

Whilst Echo cries, What shall become of me?

And desolate, my desolations pity,
<dt>
Thou in thy beauty's carrack sit'st to see
<dt>
My tragic downfall, and my funeral ditty.
<dt>
No timbrel, but my heart thou play'st upon,
<dt>
Whose strings are stretched unto the highest key;
<dt>
The diapason, love; love is the unison;
<dt>
In love my life and labors waste away.
<dt>
Only regardless to the world thou leav'st me,
<dt>
Whilst slain hopes, turning from the feast of sorrow
<dt>
Unto despair, their king which ne'er deceives me,
<dt>
Captives my heart, whose black night hates the morrow;
<dt>
And he in ruth of my distressed cry
<dt>
Plants me a weeping star within my eye.

Fair grace of graces, muse of muses all,

Thou paradise, thou only heaven I know,

What influence hath bred my hateful woe,

That I from thee and them am forced to fall?
<dt>
Thou fall'n from me, from thee I never shall;
<dt>
Although my fortunes thou hast brought so low,
<dt>
Yet shall my faith and service with thee go,
<dt>
For live I do on heaven and thee to call.
<dt>
Banished all grace, no graces with me dwell;
<dt>
Compelled to muse, my muses from me fly;
<dt>
Excluded heaven, what can remain but hell?
<dt>
Exiled from paradise, in hate I lie
<dt>
Cursing my stars; albeit I find it true,
<dt>
I lost all these when I lost love and you.

<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
To live in hell and heaven to behold;
<dt>
To welcome life and die a living death;
<dt>
To sweat with heat, and yet be freezing cold;
<dt>
To grasp at stars and lie the earth beneath;
<dt>
To tread a maze that never shall have end;
<dt>
To burn in sighs and starve in daily tears;
<dt>
To climb a hill and never to descend;
<dt>
Giants to kill, and quake at childish fears;
<dt>
To pine for food, and watch th' Hesperian tree;
<dt>
To thirst for drink, and nectar still to draw;
<dt>
To live accursed, whom men hold blest to be,
<dt>
And weep those wrongs which never creature saw:
<dt>
If this be love, if love in these be founded,
<dt>
My heart is love, for these in it are grounded.

And when this God thus born, thou lov'st, &amp; he

Loved thee again, with passion of like kind,

(As lovers' sighs, which meet, become one wind)

Both breathed one spright of equal deity.

Eternal father, whence these two do come

And wil'st the tItle of my father have,

No marvel though thy birth made Angels sing:

And kings like shepherds, humbled for thy sake,

Kneel at thy feet &amp; gifts of homage bring:

For heaven &amp; earth, the high &amp; low estate

As partners of thy birth make equal claim.

Thou seemest in thy <A href="999">syndon</A> wrapped to be

Buried in me, unto my soul appear

Prisoned in earth &amp; banished from thy sight,

Like our forefathers, who in Limbo were.

God as his sole-borne daughter lov&egrave;d thee.

To match thee like thy birth's nobility,

He thee his spirit for thy spouse did leave:

Of whom thou did'st his only son conceive,

And so was linked to all the trinity.

Cease then, O Queens who earthly crowns do wear

Stirred his seditious spirits to rebel:

God chose for chief his Champion Michael:

And gave him charge the host of heaven to guide.

And when the Angels of the Rebels' side

Vanquished in battle from their glory fell,

The pride of heaven became the Drake of hell,

And in the dungeon of despair was tied.

This Dragon since let loose God's Church assailed,

And she by help of Michael's sword prevailed.

Who ever tried adventures like this knight?

And such a monster as the Devil subdue.

He did annoint the king, whom God did take

From charge of sheep, to rule his chosen land:

But that high king who heaven &amp; earth did make

Received a holier liquor from thy hand,

For few nights' solace in delicious bed,

Where heat of lust did kindle flames of hell:

Thou nak'd on naked rock in desert cell

Lay thirty years, and tears of grief did shed.

But for that time, thy heart there sorrowed,

Thou now in heaven eternally dost dwell,

And for each tear, which from thine eyes then fell,

A sea of pleasure now is rendered.

If short delights entice my heart to stray,

How dear I should for trifling pleasures pay:
<dt>
And if I virtue's rough beginning shun,

Let thy eternal joys unto me show
<dt>
What high Reward by little pain is won.

Because thou wast the daughter of a king,
<dt>
Whose beauty did all nature's works exceed,
<dt>
And wisdom, wonder to the world did breed,
<dt>
A Muse might raise itself on Cupid's wing.
<dt>
But since these graces which from Nature spring
<dt>
Were graced by those which from grace did proceed,
<dt>
And glory hath deserved; my muse doth need
<dt>
An Angel's feathers when thy praise I sing.
<dt>
For all in thee became Angelical:
<dt>
An Angel's face, had Angel's purity:
<dt>
And thou an Angel's tongue did'st speak withal.
<dt>
Loe why thy soul set free by Martyrdom,
<dt>
Was crowned by God in Angels' company,
<dt>
And Angels' hands thy body did entomb.

Fair Amazon of heaven: who took'st in hand
<dt>
St. Michael &amp; St. George to imitate:
<dt>
And for a tyrant's Love transformed to hate,
<dt>
Wast for thy lily faith retained in band:
<dt>
Alone on foot &amp; with thy naked hand
<dt>
Thou did'st like Michael &amp; his host: &amp; that
<dt>
For which on horse armed George we celebrate:
<dt>
Whilst thou, like them, a dragon did'st withstand.
<dt>
Behold my soul shut in my body's jail,
<dt>
The which the Drake of hell gapes to devour;
<dt>
Teach me (o virgin) how thou did'st prevail:
<dt>
<I>Virginity</I> thou saiest was all thy Aid:
<dt>
Give me then purity instead of power,
<dt>
And let my soul, made chaste, pass for a Maid.

Sovereign of Queens: If vain Ambition move
<dt>
My heart to seek an earthly prince's grace:
<dt>
Show me thy son in his imperial place,
<dt>
Whose servants reign, our kings &amp; queens above.
<dt>
And if alluring passions I do prove,
<dt>
By pleasing sighs: show me thy lovely face:
<dt>
Whose beams the Angels' beauty do deface:
<dt>
And even inflame the Seraphims with love.
<dt>
So by Ambition I shall humble be:
<dt>
When in the presence of the highest king
<dt>
I serve all his, that he may honour me.
<dt>
And love, my heart to chaste desires shall bring,
<dt>
When fairest Queen looks on me from her throne
<dt>
And jealous bids me love but her alone.

Why should I any love O queene but thee?
<dt>
If favour past a thankful love should breed?
<dt>
Thy womb did bear, thy breast my saviour feed;
<dt>
And thou did'st never cease to succour me.
<dt>
If Love do follow worth and dignity?
<dt>
Thou all in thy perfections dost exceed:
<dt>
If Love be led by hope of future meed?
<dt>
What pleasure more than thee in heaven to see?
<dt>
And earthly sight doth only please the eye
<dt>
And breeds desire, but doth not satisfy:
<dt>
Thy sight gives us possession of all joy,
<dt>
And with such full delights each sense shall fill,
<dt>
As heart shall wish but for to see thee still,
<dt>
And ever seeing, ever shall enjoy.

Sweet Queen: although thy beauty raise up me
<dt>
From sight of baser beauties here below:
<dt>
Yet let me not rest there: but higher go
<dt>
To him, who took his shape from God &amp; thee.
<dt>
And if thy form in him more fair I see,
<dt>
What pleasure from his deity shall flow,
<dt>
By whose fair beams his beauty shineth so
<dt>
When I shall it behold eternally.
<dt>
Then shall my love of pleasure have his fill,
<dt>
When beauty's self in whom all pleasure is,
<dt>
Shall my enamored soul embrace &amp; kiss:
<dt>
And shall new loves &amp; new delights distill,
<dt>
Which from my soul shall gush into my heart
<dt>
And through my body flow to every part.

Blessed Offender: who thyself hast tried
<dt>
How far a sinner differs from a Saint
<dt>
Join thy wet eyes, with tears of my complaint,
<dt>
While I sigh for that grave, for which thou cried.
<dt>
No longer let my sinful soul abide
<dt>
In fever of thy first desires faint:
<dt>
But let that love which last thy heart did taint
<dt>
With pangs of thy repentance pierce my side.
<dt>
So shall my soul no foolish virgin be
<dt>
With empty lamp: but like a Magdalen, bear
<dt>
For ointment box a breast with oil of grace:
<dt>
And so the zeal, which then shall burn in me,
<dt>
May make my heart like to a lamp appear
<dt>
And in my spouse's palace give me place.

Such as retired from sight of men, like thee
<dt>
By penance seek the joys of heaven to win;
<dt>
In deserts make their paradise begin:
<dt>
And even among wild beasts do Angels see.
<dt>
In such a place my soul doth seem to be
<dt>
When in my body she laments her sin:
<dt>
And none but brutal passions finds therein,
<dt>
Except they be sent down from heaven to mee.
<dt>
Yet if those graces God to me impart,
<dt>
Which he inspired thy blessed breast withal;
<dt>
I may find heaven in my retired heart:
<dt>
And if thou change the object of my love,
<dt>
The winged affection which men Cupid call
<dt>
May get his sight &amp; like an Angel prove.

Sweet Saint: Thou better canst declare to me,
<dt>
What pleasure is obtained by heavenly love
<dt>
Than they which other loves did never prove:
<dt>
Or which in sex are differing from thee:
<dt>
For like a woman spouse my soul shall be,
<dt>
Whom sinful passions once to lust did move,
<dt>
And since betroth&egrave;d to God's son above,
<dt>
Should be enamored with his deity.
<dt>
My body is the garment of my spright
<dt>
While as the daytime of my life doth last:
<dt>
When death shall bring the night of my delight
<dt>
My soul unclothed shall rest from labors past:
<dt>
And clasp&egrave;d in the arms of God, enjoy
<dt>
By sweet conjunction, everlasting joy.
