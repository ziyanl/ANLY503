<dt>The moon that borrows now a gentle light
<dt>Once burned another sun; then from on high
<dt>The earth received a double day; the sky
<dt>Showed but faint stars, and never knew a night.
<dt>The poles, now frigid and for ever white
<dt>With the deep snows that on their bosoms lie,
<dt>Were torrid as the moon that hung thereby
<dt>And mingled rays as fiercely hot as bright.
<dt>Mutations infinite! Through shifting sea
<dt>And lands huge monstrous beasts once took their range
<dt>Where now our stately world shows pleasantly!
<dt>Then be not fearful at the thought of change,
<dt>For though unknown the times that are to be,
<dt>Yet shall they prove most beautifully strange.
