<p>"This impressive, if structually unsatisfactory sonnet, is from Mr. Call's <i>Golden Histories</i> (Smith, Elder & Co., 1871). Mr. Call has written much, but has not succeeded in attracting wide notice. He has certainly, however, written no other sonnet so fine as this..." (<a href="bibliogr.htm#sharp1">Sharp</a>)

<p>
<dt>I walk'd at sunset by the lonely waves,
<dt>When Autumn stood about me, gold and brown;
<dt>I watch'd the great red sun, in clouds, go down,
<dt>An Orient King, that 'mid his bronz&euml;d slaves
<dt>Dies, leaning on his sceptre, with his crown.
<dt>A hollow moaning from innumerous caves,
<dt>In green and glassy darkness sunk below,
<dt>Told of some grand and ancient deed of woe,
<dt>Of murdered kings that sleep in weltering graves.
<dt>Still thro' the sunshine wavering to and fro,
<dt>With sails all set, the little vessels glide;
<dt>Mild is the Eve and mild the ebbing Tide,
<dt>And yet that hollow moaning will not go,
<dt>Nor the old Fears that with the Sea abide.
