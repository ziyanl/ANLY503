<a name=#010></a><h2>To November</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Dismal November! me it soothes to view,
<dt>At parting day, the scanty foliage fall
<dt>From the wet fruit tree, or the grey stone wall,
<dt>Whose cold films glisten with unwholesome dew;
<dt>To watch the yellow mists from the dank earth
<dt>Enfold the neighbouring copse; while on as they pass
<dt>The silent rain-drops bend the long rank grass
<dt>Which wraps some blossom's unmatur&eacute;d birth.
<p>
<dt>And through my cot's lone lattice glimmering grey
<dt>Thy damp chill evenings have a charm for me,
<dt>Dismal November! for strange vacancy
<dt>Summoneth then my very heart away!
<dt>Till from mist-hidden spire comes the slow knell,
<dt>And says, that in the still air Death doth dwell!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>To the Sabbath</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Ah! quiet day, I oft recall the time
<dt>When I did chase my childish sluggishness
<dt>The "rear of darkness lingering still"--to dress
<dt>In due sort for thy coming: the first chime
<dt>Of blithesome bells that ushered in the morn
<dt>Carolled to me of rest and simplest mirth:
<dt>It was then all happiness on the wide earth
<dt>To gaze! I little dreamt that man was born
<dt>For aught but wholesome toil and holiest praise,
<dt>Thanking that God who made him to rejoice!
<dt>But I am chang&eacute;d now! nor could I raise
<dt>My sunken spirit at thy well-known voice;
<dt>But that thou seemest soothingly to say,
<dt>"Look up, poor mourner, to a better day."
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Dejection</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Is not all nature smiling? Why should I
<dt>Pine with the agonies of wretchedness?
<dt>This active life excites, that vanity,
<dt>And him the fervours of affection bless.
<dt>Ambition beckoning waves her banners high,
<dt>Streaming with rays of glory and success,
<dt>And on the wings of folly thousands fly
<dt>To grasp the toy of hourly happiness.
<p>
<dt>Dejection presses me with power like fate
<dt>In fellowship with woe, and inward care;
<dt>The beauteous forms of nature wrought so fair
<dt>Sink on my spirits with a weary weight;
<dt>Nor active life less threatens with despair,
<dt>There flourish insincerity and hate.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Written after a Walk by Rydal Water, Westmoreland, in Time of War</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In such a day how calm and mild this scene,
<dt>Made for poetic thought. The woods displayed
<dt>Of brown and yellow every varying shade
<dt>And here and there the fresh and lingering green
<dt>Told yet of summer and her days serene,
<dt>Too soon departed! Fading fern arrayed
<dt>The russet hills; and as faint sun-gleams strayed,
<dt>In warmer hues the upland slopes were seen.
<p>
<dt>Oh, beauteous aspect of a beauteous world!
<dt>Mournful to think how little understood!
<dt>In man's distempered heart hath frenzy hurled
<dt>Envenomed shafts. The sword, defiled with blood,
<dt>Lays waste the earth; and over the ocean flood
<dt>The crimson flag of discord is unfurled.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The Faithful One</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Where is that crowd of friends that could dispense
<dt>Refreshing rapture to life's sunny morn?
<dt>Where are those loves, affections, that are born
<dt>Of freedom, sentiment, and confidence?
<dt>It is silent all! a blank to every sense!
<dt>The energy of life, that used to scorn
<dt>The rule of pale experience, is withdrawn!
<dt>That power erewhile so buoyant and intense.
<p>
<dt>Yet there is one who faithful still remains,
<dt>Who loves my solitude, as once she loved
<dt>My cheer in social life: who loves my joy,
<dt>Nor flies my couch when gnawing sickness reigns:
<dt>She, like the minister of heaven, hath proved
<dt>That "time and chance" can true love never destroy.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>After Seeing "Rob Roy" at Covent Garden</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Macready! thou hast pleased me much; till now
<dt>(And yet I would not thy fine powers arraign)
<dt>I did not think thou hadst that livelier vein
<dt>Nor that clear open spirit on thy brow.
<dt>Come, I will crown thee with Apollo's bough;
<dt>Mine is a humble branch, yet not in vain
<dt>Given, if the few I sing shall not disdain
<dt>To wear the little wreaths that I bestow:--
<p>
<dt>There is a buoyant air, a passionate tone
<dt>That breathes about thee, lighting up thine eye
<dt>With fire and freedom; it becomes thee well.
<dt>It is the bursting of a good seed sown
<dt>Beneath a cold and artificial sky;
<dt>It is genius overmastering its spell.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>The Breeze</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When from my dreary home I first moved on
<dt>After my friend was in her grave-clothes dressed,
<dt>A dim despondence on my spirit pressed
<dt>As all my pleasant days were come and gone!
<dt>Strange whispers parted from the entombing clay,
<dt>The thin air murmured, each dumb object spake,
<dt>Bidding my overwhelm&eacute;d bosom ache;
<dt>Oft did I look to heaven, but could not pray.
<p>
<dt>"How shall I leave thee, quiet scene?" said I,
<dt>"How leave the passing breeze that loves to sweep
<dt>The holy sod where my due footsteps creep?"
<dt>"The passing breeze? It was she! Thy friend passed by!"
<dt>But the time came; the passing breeze I left;
<dt>"Farewell," I sighed; and seemed of all bereft.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>To Sophia: Dedicatory</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Once we had joys in common: common woes
<dt>Have lately been our portion, friend, once loved!
<dt>And still as much loved as mid sorrow's throes
<dt>It is possible to move, or to be moved.
<dt>Faithless I'm not because no word that glows,
<dt>No look that cheers accost a friend approved;
<dt>Love's language lies in more profound repose
<dt>Than that of death, since hope has been removed
<dt>From my soul's dreams.
<dt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But couldst thou pierce my heart
<dt>And see the tenderest thought it doth enshrine,
<dt>It is, should myself and sorrow ever part,
<dt>Mine eyes shall then tell thee when sought by thine,
<dt>While blessed tears gush, like children's, without art,
<dt>"These had not flowed, wert thou again not mine."
