<p>Raised in a wealthy Jewish family in New York, Emma Lazarus devoted herself to Zionist and Marxist causes after hearing about the pogroms in Russia in the 1880s. She translated several important Jewish works, and "The New Colossus" is inscribed on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.

<p>
<dt>Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
<dt>With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
<dt>Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
<dt>A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
<dt>Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
<dt>Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
<dt>Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
<dt>The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
<dt>"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
<dt>With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
<dt>Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
<dt>The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
<dt>Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
<dt>I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"
<p>
<a name=110></a><h2>1492</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou two-faced year, Mother of Change and Fate,
<dt>Didst weep when Spain cast forth with flaming sword,
<dt>The children of the prophets of the Lord,
<dt>Prince, priest, and people, spurned by zealot hate.
<dt>Hounded from sea to sea, from state to state,
<dt>The West refused them, and the East abhorred.
<dt>No anchorage the known world could afford,
<dt>Close-locked was every port, barred every gate.
<dt>Then smiling, thou unveil'dst, O two-faced year,
<dt>A virgin world where doors of sunset part,
<dt>Saying, "Ho, all who weary, enter here!
<dt>There falls each ancient barrier that the art
<dt>Of race or creed or rank devised, to rear
<dt>Grim bulwarked hatred between heart and heart!"
<p>
<a name=150></a><h2>Long Island Sound</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I see it as it looked one afternoon
<dt>In August,--by a fresh soft breeze o'erblown
<dt>The swiftness of the tide, the light thereon.
<dt>A far-off sail, white as a crescent moon.
<dt>The shining waters with pale currents strewn,
<dt>The quiet fishing-smacks, the Eastern cove,
<dt>The semi-circle of its dark, green grove.
<dt>The luminous grasses, the merry sun
<dt>In the grave sky; the sparkle far and wide
<dt>Laughter of unseen children, cheerful chirp
<dt>Of crickets, and low lisp of rippling tide
<dt>Light summer clouds fantastical as sleep
<dt>Changing unnoted while I gazed thereon
<dt>All these fair sounds and sights I made my own.
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>Echoes</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Late-born and woman-souled I dare not hope,
<dt>The freshness of the elder lays, the might
<dt>Of manly, modern passion shall alight
<dt>Upon my Muse's lips, nor may I cope
<dt>(Who veiled and screened by womanhood must grope)
<dt>With the world's strong-armed warriors and recite
<dt>The dangers, wounds, and triumphs of the fight;
<dt>Twanging the full-stringed lyre through all its scope.
<dt>But if thou ever in some lake-floored cave
<dt>O'erbrowed by rocks, a wild voice wooed and heard,
<dt>Answering at once from heaven and earth and wave,
<dt>Lending elf-music to thy harshest word,
<dt>Misprize thou not these echoes that belong
<dt>To one in love with solitude and song.
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>Assurance</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Last night I slept, and when I woke her kiss
<dt>Still floated on my lips. For we had strayed
<dt>Together in my dream, through some dim glade,
<dt>Where the shy moonbeams scarce dared light our bliss.
<dt>The air was dank with dew, between the trees,
<dt>The hidden glow-worms kindled and were spent.
<dt>Cheek pressed to cheek, the cool, the hot night-breeze
<dt>Mingled ouir hair, our breath, and came and went,
<dt>As sporting with our passion. Low and deep
<dt>Spake in mine ear her voice: "And didst thou dream,
<dt>This could be buried? This could be sleep?
<dt>And love be thrall to death! Nay, whatso seem,
<dt>Have faith, dear heart; <i>this is the thing that is</i>!"
<dt>Thereon I woke, and on my lips her kiss.
<p>
<a name=310></a><h2>Marriage Bells</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Music and silver chimes and sunlit air,
<dt>Freighted with the scent of honeyed orange-flower;
<dt>Glad, friendly festal faces everywhere.
<dt>She, rapt from all in this unearthly hour,
<dt>With cloudlike, cast-back veil and faint-flushed cheek,
<dt>In bridal beauty moves as in a trance
<dt>Alone with <i>him</i>, and fears to breathe, to speak,
<dt>Lest the rare, subtle spell dissolve perchance.
<dt>But he upon that floral head looks down,
<dt>Noting the misty eyes, the grave sweet brow--
<dt>Doubts if her bliss be perfect as his own,
<dt>And dedicates anew with inward vow
<dt>His soul unto her service, to repay
<dt>Richly the sacrifice she yields this day.
<p>
<a name=320></a><h2>The Taming of the Falcon</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The bird sits spelled upon the lithe brown wrist
<dt>Of yonder turbaned fowler, who had lamed
<dt>No feather limb, but the winged spirit tamed
<dt>With his compelling eye. He need not trust
<dt>The silken coil, not set the thick-limed snare;
<dt>He lures the wanderer with his steadfast gaze,
<dt>It shrinks, it quails, it trembles yet obeys.
<dt>And, lo! he has enslaved the thing of air.
<dt>The fixed, insistent human will is lord
<dt>Of all the earth;--but in the awful sky
<dt>Reigns absolute, unreached by deed or word
<dt>Above creation; through eternity,
<dt>Outshining the sun's shield, the lightening's sword,
<dt>The might of Allah's unaverted eye.
<p>
<a name=330></a><h2>To R. W. E.</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As when a father dies, his children draw
<dt>About the empty hearth, their loss to cheat
<dt>With uttered praise & love, & oft repeat
<dt>His all-familiar words with whispered awe.
<dt>The honored habit of his daily law,
<dt>Not for his sake, but theirs whose feeble feet
<dt>Need still that guiding lamp, whose faith, less sweet,
<dt>Misses that tempered patience without flaw,
<dt>So do we gather round thy vacant chair,
<dt>In thine own elm-roofed, amber-rivered town,
<dt>Master & Father! For the love we bear,
<dt>Not for thy fame's sake, do we weave this crown,
<dt>And feel thy presence in the sacred air,
<dt>Forbidding us to weep that thou art gone.
<p>
<a name=340></a><h2>Venus of the Louvre</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Down the long hall she glistens like a star,
<dt>The foam-born mother of Love, transfixed to stone,
<dt>Yet none the less immortal, breathing on.
<dt>Time's brutal hand hath maimed but could not mar.
<dt>When first the enthralled enchantress from afar
<dt>Dazzled mine eyes, I saw not her alone,
<dt>Serenely poised on her world-worshipped throne,
<dt>As when she guided once her dove-drawn car,--
<dt>But at her feet a pale, death-stricken Jew,
<dt>Her life adorer, sobbed farewell to love.
<dt>Here <i>Heine</i> wept!  Here still he weeps anew,
<dt>Nor ever shall his shadow lift or move,
<dt>While mourns one ardent heart, one poet-brain,
<dt>For vanished Hellas and Hebraic plain.
<p>
<a name=410></a><h2>Success</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oft have I brooded on defeat and pain,
<dt>The pathos of the stupid, stumbling throng.
<dt>These I ignore to-day and only long
<dt>To pour my soul forth in one trumpet strain,
<dt>One clear, grief-shattering, triumphant song,
<dt>For all the victories of man's high endeavor,
<dt>Palm-bearing, laureled deeds that live forever,
<dt>The splendor clothing him whose will is strong.
<dt>Hast thou beheld the deep, glad eyes of one
<dt>Who has persisted and achieved?  Rejoice!
<dt>On naught diviner shines the all-seeing sun.
<dt>Salute him with free heart and choral voice,
<dt>'Midst flippant, feeble crowds of spectres wan,
<dt>The bold, significant, successful man.
<p>

<p>
<dt>A dream of interlinking hands, of feet
<dt>Tireless to spin the unseen, fairy woof
<dt>Of the entangling waltz.  Bright eyebeams meet,
<dt>Gay laughter echoes from the vaulted roof.
<dt>Warm perfumes rise; the soft unflickering glow
<dt>Of branching lights sets off the changeful charms
<dt>Of glancing gems, rich stuffs, the dazzling snow
<dt>Of necks unkerchieft, and bare, clinging arms.
<dt>Hark to the music!  How beneath the strain
<dt>Of reckless revelry, vibrates and sobs
<dt>One fundamental chord of constant pain,
<dt>The pulse-beat of the poet's heart that throbs.
<dt>So yearns, though all the dancing waves rejoice,
<dt>The troubled sea's disconsolate, deep voice.
<p>
<a name=421></a><h2>II</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Who shall proclaim the golden fable false
<dt>Of Orpheus' miracles?  This subtle strain
<dt>Above our prose-world's sordid loss and gain
<dt>Lightly uplifts us. With the rhythmic waltz,
<dt>The lyric prelude, the nocturnal song
<dt>Of love and languor, varied visions rise,
<dt>That melt and blend to our enchanted eyes.
<dt>The Polish poet who sleeps silenced long,
<dt>The seraph-souled musician, breathes again
<dt>Eternal eloquence, immortal pain.
<dt>Revived the exalted face we know so well,
<dt>The illuminated eyes, the fragile frame,
<dt>Slowly consuming with its inward flame,
<dt>We stir not, speak not, lest we break the spell.
<p>
<a name=422></a><h2>III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A voice was needed, sweet and true and fine
<dt>As the sad spirit of the evening breeze,
<dt>Throbbing with human passion, yet devine
<dt>As the wild bird's untutored melodies.
<dt>A voice for him 'neath twilight heavens dim,
<dt>Who mourneth for his dead, while round him fall
<dt>The wan and noiseless leaves.  A voice for him
<dt>Who sees the first green sprout, who hears the call
<dt>Of the first robin on the first spring day.
<dt>A voice for all whom Fate hath set apart,
<dt>Who, still misprized, must perish by the way,
<dt>Longing with love, for that they lack the art
<dt>Of their own soul's expression.  For all these
<dt>Sing the unspoken hope, the vague, sad reveries.
<p>
<a name=423></a><h2>IV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Then Nature shaped a poet's heart--a lyre
<dt>From out whose chords the lightest breeze that blows
<dt>Drew trembling music, wakening sweet desire.
<dt>How shall she cherish him?  Behold!  she throws
<dt>This precious, fragile treasure in the whirl
<dt>Of seething passions; he is scourged and stung,
<dt>Must dive in storm-vext seas, if but one pearl
<dt>Of art or beauty therefrom may be wrung.
<dt>No pure-browed pensive nymph his Muse shall be,
<dt>An amazon of thought with sovereign eyes,
<dt>Whose kiss was poison, man-brained, worldy-wise,
<dt>Inspired that elfin, delicate harmony.
<dt>Rich gain for us!  But with him is it well?
<dt>The poet who must sound earth, heaven, and hell!

<h2>Symphonic Studies (After Robert Schumann)</h2>
<a name=430></a><h2>Prelude</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Blue storm-clouds in hot heavens of mid-July
<dt>Hung heavy, brooding over land and sea:
<dt>Our hearts, a-tremble, throbbed in harmony
<dt>With the wild, restless tone of air and sky.
<dt>Shall we not call im Prospero who held
<dt>In his enchanted hands the fateful key
<dt>Of that tempestuous hour's mystery,
<dt>And with controlling wand our spirits spelled,
<dt>With him to wander by a sun-bright shore,
<dt>To hear fine, fairy voices, and to fly
<dt>With disembodied Ariel once more
<dt>Above earth's wrack and ruin?  Far and nigh
<dt>The laughter of the thunder echoed loud,
<dt>And harmless lightnings leapt from cloud to cloud.
<p>
<a name=431></a><h2>I</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Floating upon a swelling wave of sound,
<dt>We seemed to overlook an endless sea:
<dt>Poised 'twixt clear heavens and glittering surf were we.
<dt>We drank the air in flight:  we knew no bound
<dt>To the audacious ventures of desire.
<dt>Nigh us the sun was dropping, drowned in gold;
<dt>Deep, deep below the burning billows rolled;
<dt>And all the sea sang like a smitten lyre.
<dt>Oh, the wild voices of those chanting waves!
<dt>The human faces glimpsed beneath the tide!
<dt>Familiar eyes gazed from profound sea-caves,
<dt>And we, exalted, were as we had died.
<dt>We knew the sea was Life, the harmonious cry
<dt>The blended discords of humanity.
<p>
<a name=432></a><h2>II</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Look deeper yet:  mark 'midst the wave-blurred mass,
<dt>In lines distinct, in colors clear defined,
<dt>The typic groups and figures of mankind.
<dt>Behold within the cool and liquid glass
<dt>Bright child-folk sporting with smooth yellow shells,
<dt>Astride of dolphins, leaping up to kiss
<dt>Fair mother-faces.  From the vast abyss
<dt>How joyously their thought-free laughter wells!
<dt>Some slumber in grim caverns unafraid,
<dt>Lulled by the overwhelming water's sound,
<dt>And some make mouths at dragons, undismayed.
<dt>Oh dauntless innocence!  The gulfs profound
<dt>Re&euml;cho strangely with their ringing glee,
<dt>And with wise mermaids' plaintive melody.
<p>
<a name=433></a><h2>III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What do the sea-nymphs in that coral cave?
<dt>With wondering eyes their supple forms they bend
<dt>O'er something rarely beautiful.  They lend
<dt>Their lithe white arms, and through the golden wave
<dt>They lift it tenderly.  Oh blinding sight!
<dt>A naked, radiant goddess, tranced in sleep,
<dt>Full-limbed, voluptuous, 'neath the mantling sweep
<dt>Of auburn locks that kiss her ankles white!
<dt>Upward they bear her, chanting low and sweet:
<dt>The clinging waters part before their way,
<dt>Jewels of flame are dancing 'neath their feet.
<dt>Up in the sunshine, on soft foam, they lay
<dt>Their precious burden, and return forlorn.
<dt>Oh, bliss!  oh, anguish!  Mortals, <i>Love</i> is born!
<p>
<a name=434></a><h2>IV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Hark!  from unfathomable deeps a dirge
<dt>Swells sobbing through the melancholy air:
<dt>Where love has entered, Death is also there.
<dt>The wail outrings the chafed, tumultuous surge;
<dt>Ocean and earth, the illimitable skies,
<dt>Prolong one note, a mourning for the dead,
<dt>The cry of souls not to be comforted.
<dt>What piercing music!  Funeral visions rise,
<dt>And send the hot tears raining down our cheek.
<dt>We see the silent grave upon the hill
<dt>With its lone lilac-bush.  O heart, be still!
<dt>She will not rise, she will not stir nor speak.
<dt>Surely, the unreturning dead are blest.
<dt>Ring on, sweet dirge, and knell us to our rest!
<p>
<a name=435></a><h2>V</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Upon the silver beach the undines dance
<dt>With interlinking arms and flying hair;
<dt>Like polished marble gleam their limbs left bare;
<dt>Upon their virgin rites pale moonbeams glance.
<dt>Softer the music!  for their foam-bright feet
<dt>Print not the moist floor where they trip their round:
<dt>Affrighted they will scatter at a sound,
<dt>Leap in their cool sea-chambers, nibly fleet,
<dt>And we shall doubt that we have ever seen,
<dt>While our sane eyes behold stray wreaths of mist,
<dt>Shot with faint colors by the moon-rays kissed,
<dt>Floating snow-soft, snow-white, where these had been.
<dt>Already, look!  the wave-washed sands are bare,
<dt>And mocking laughter ripples through the air.

<p>
<dt>Divided 'twixt the dream-world and the real,
<dt>We heard the waxing passion of the song
<dt>Soar as to scale the heavens on pinions strong.
<dt>Amidst the long-reverberant thunder-peal,
<dt>Against the rain-blurred square of light, the head
<dt>Of the pale poet at the lyric keys
<dt>Stood boldly cut, absorbed in reveries,
<dt>While over it keen-bladed lightnings played.
<dt>"Rage on, wild storm!" the music seemed to sing:
<dt>"Not all the thunders of thy wrath can move
<dt>The soul that's dedicate to worshipping
<dt>Eternal Beauty, everlasting Love."
<dt>No more!  the song was ended, and behold,
<dt>A rainbow trembling on a sky of gold!
<p>
<a name=437></a><h2>Epilogue</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Forth in the sunlit, rain-bathed air we stepped,
<dt>Sweet with the dripping grass and flowering vine,
<dt>And saw through irised clouds the pale sun shine.
<dt>Back o'er the hills the rain-mist slowly crept
<dt>Like a transparent curtain's silvery sheen;
<dt>And fronting us the painted bow was arched,
<dt>Whereunder the majestic cloud-shapes marched:
<dt>In the wet, yellow light the dazzling green
<dt>Of lawn and bush and tree seemed stained with blue.
<dt>Our hearts o'erflowed with peace.  With smiles we spake
<dt>Of partings in the past, of courage new,
<dt>Of high achievement, of the dreams that make
<dt>A wonder and a glory of our days,
<dt>And all life's music but a hymn of praise.

<a name=440></a><h2>1856</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Paris, from throats of iron, silver, brass,
<dt>Joy-thundering cannon, blent with chiming bells,
<dt>And martial strains, the full-voiced p&aelig;an swells.
<dt>The air is starred with flags, the chanted mass
<dt>Throngs all the churches, yet the broad streets swarm
<dt>With glad-eyed groups who chatter, laugh, and pass,
<dt>In holiday confusion, class with class.
<dt>And over all the spring, the sun-floods warm!
<dt>In the Imperial palace that March morn,
<dt>The beautiful young mother lay and smiled;
<dt>For by her side just breathed the Prince, her child,
<dt>Heir to an empire, to the purple born,
<dt>Crowned with the Titan's name that stirs the heart
<dt>Like a blown clarion--one more Bonaparte.

<dt>Born to the purple, lying stark and dead,
<dt>Transfixed with poisoned spears, beneath the sun
<dt>Of brazen Africa! Thy grave is one,
<dt>Fore-fated youth (on whom were visited
<dt>Follies and sins not thine), whereat the world,
<dt>Heartless howe'er it be, will pause to sing
<dt>A dirge, to breathe a sigh, a wreath to fling
<dt>Of rosemary and rue with bay-leaves curled.
<dt>Enmeshed in toils ambitious, not thine own,
<dt>Immortal, loved boy-Prince, thou tak'st thy stand
<dt>With early doomed Don Carlos, hand in hand

<p>
<dt>So, Calchas, on the sacred Palatine,
<dt>You thought of Mopsus, and o'er wastes of sea
<dt>A flower brought your message.  I divine
<dt>(Through my deep art) the kindly mockery
<dt>That played about your lips and in your eyes,
<dt>Plucking the frail leaf, while you dreamed of home.
<dt>Thanks for the silent greeting!  I shall prize,
<dt>Beyond June's rose, the scentless flower of Rome.
<dt>All the Campagna spreads before my sight,
<dt>The mouldering wall, the Caesars' tombs unwreathed,
<dt>Rome and the Tiber, and the yellow light,
<dt>Wherein the honey-colored blossom breathed.
<dt>But most I thank it--egoists that we be!
<dt>For proving then and there you thought of me.

<p>
<dt>There was a man who watched the river flow
<dt>Past the huge town, one gray November day.
<dt>Round him in narrow high-piled streets at play
<dt>The boys made merry as they saw him go,
<dt>Murmuring half-loud, with eyes upon the stream,
<dt>The immortal screed he held within his hand.
<dt>For he was walking in an April land
<dt>With Faust and Helen.  Shadowy as a dream
<dt>Was the prose-world, the river and the town.
<dt>Wild joy possessed him; through enchanted skies
<dt>He saw the cranes of Ibycus swoop down.
<dt>He closed the page, he lifted up his eyes,
<dt>Lo--a black line of birds in wavering thread
<dt>Bore him the greetings of the deathless dead!

<p>
<dt>No man had ever heard a nightingale,
<dt>When once a keen-eyed naturalist was stirred
<dt>To study and define--<i>what is a bird,</i>
<dt>To classify by rote and book, nor fail
<dt>To mark its structure and to note the scale
<dt>Whereon its song might possibly be heard.
<dt>Thus far, no farther;--so he spake the word.
<dt>When of a sudden,--hark, the nightingale!
<p>
<dt>Oh deeper, higher than he could divine
<dt>That all-unearthly, untaught strain!  He saw
<dt>The plain, brown warbler, unabashed. "Not mine"

<dt>No bird is this, it soars beyond my line,
<dt>Were it a bird, 'twould answer to my law."

<dt>When the vexed hubbub of our world of gain
<dt>Roars round about me as I walk the street,
<dt>The myriad noise of Traffic, and the beat
<dt>Of Toil's incessant hammer, the fierce strain
<dt>Of struggle hand to hand and brain to brain,
<dt>Ofttimes a sudden dream my sense will cheat,
<dt>The gaudy shops, the sky-piled roofs retreat,
<dt>And all at once I stand enthralled again
<dt>Within a marble minster over-seas.
<dt>I watch the solemn gold-stained gloom that creeps
<dt>To kiss an alabaster tomb, where sleeps
<dt>A lady 'twixt two knights' stone effigies,
<dt>And every day in dusky glory steeps
<dt>Their sculptured slumber of five centuries

<dt>Not while the fever of the blood is strong,
<dt>The heart throbs loud, the eyes are veiled, no less
<dt>With passion than with tears, the Muse shall bless
<dt>The poet-sould to help and soothe with song.
<dt>Not then she bids his trembling lips express
<dt>The aching gladness, the voluptuous pain.
<dt>Life is his poem then; flesh, sense, and brain
<dt>One full-stringed lyre attuned to happiness.
<dt>But when the dream is done, the pulses fail,
<dt>The day's illusion, with the day's sun set,
<dt>He, lonely in the twilight, sees the pale
<dt>Divine Consoler, featured like Regret,
<dt>Enter and clasp his hand and kiss his brow.
<dt>Then his lips ope to sing--as mine do now.

<p>
<dt>Therefore I dare reveal my private woe,
<dt>The secret blots of my imperfect heart,
<dt>Nor strive to shrink or swell mine own desert,
<dt>Nor beautify nor hide.  For this I know,
<dt>That even as I am, thou also art.
<dt>Thou past heroic forms unmoved shalt go,
<dt>To pause and bide with me, to whisper low:
<dt>"Not I alone am weak, not I apart
<dt>Must suffer, struggle, conquer day by day.
<dt>Here is my very cross by strangers borne,
<dt>Here is my bosom-sin wherefrom I pray
<dt>Hourly deliverance--this my rose, my thorn.
<dt>This woman my soul's need can understand,
<dt>Stretching o'er silent gulfs her sister hand."

<dt>As the blind Milton's memory of light,
<dt>The deaf Beethoven's phantasy of tone,
<dt>Wroght joys for them surpassing all things known
<dt>In our restricted sphere of sound and sight,--
<dt>So while the glaring streets of brick and stone
<dt>Vix with heat, noise, and dust from morn till night,
<dt>I will give rein to Fancy, taking flight
<dt>From dismal now and here, and dwell alone
<dt>With new-enfranchised senses. All day long,
<dt>Think ye 't is I, who sit 'twixt darkened walls,
<dt>While ye chase beauty over land and sea?
<dt>Uplift on wings of some rare poet's song
<dt>Where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls,
<dt>I soar cloud-high, free as the winds are free.

<dt>Who grasps the substance? who 'mid shadows strays?
<dt>He who within some dark-bright wood reclines,
<dt>'Twixt sleep and waking, where the needled pines
<dt>Have cushioned al his couch with soft brown sprays?
<dt>He notes not how the living water shines,
<dt>Trembling along the cliff, a flickering haze,
<dt>Brimming a wine-bright pool, nor lifts his gaze
<dt>To read the ancient wonders and the signs.
<dt>Does he possess the actual, or do I,
<dt>Who paint on air more than his sense receives,
<dt>The glittering pine-tufts with closed eyes behold,
<dt>Breathe the strong resinous perfume, see the sky
<dt>Quiver like azure flame between the leaves,
<dt>And open unseen gates with key of gold?

<dt>The fervent, pale-faced Mother ere she sleep,
<dt>Looks out upon the zigzag-lighted square,
<dt>The beautiful bare trees, the blue night-air,
<dt>The revelation of the star-strewn deep,
<dt>World above world, and heaven over heaven.
<dt>Between the tree-tops and the skies, her sight
<dt>Rests on a steadfast, ruddy-shining light,
<dt>High in the tower, an earthly star of even.
<dt>Hers is the faith in saints' and angels' power,
<dt>And mediating love--she breathes a prayer
<dt>For yon tired watcher in the gray old tower.
<dt>He the shrewd, skeptic poet unaware
<dt>Feels comforted and stilled, and knows not whence
<dt>Falls this unwonted peace on heart and sense.

<p>
<dt>Well-nigh two thousand years hath Israel
<dt>Suffered the scorn of man for love of God;
<dt>Endured the outlaw's ban, the yoke, the rod,
<dt>With perfect patience.  Empires rose and fell,
<dt>Around him Nebo was adored and Bel;
<dt>Edom was drunk with victory, and trod
<dt>On his high places, while the sacred sod
<dt>Was desecrated by the infidel.
<dt>His faith proved steadfast, without breach or flaw,
<dt>But now the last renouncement is required.
<dt>His truth prevails, his God is God, his Law
<dt>Is found the wisdom most to be desired.
<dt>Not his the glory!  He, maligned, misknown,
<dt>Bows his meek head, and says, "Thy will be done!"
