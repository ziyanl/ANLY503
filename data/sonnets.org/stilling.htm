<p>
<dt>Sweet-natured Lord, at whose birth all the spheres
<dt>Tuned their best harmony, and on whose head
<dt>Kind heaven its choicest dews in plenty shed;
<dt>Teach me what secrets in this vale of tears
<dt>Support thy easy mind! Vain hopes and fears,
<dt>That over the rest a chequered shadow spread,
<dt>Leave thee unclouded; thou dost gaily tread
<dt>As in a path that sunshine never cheers.
<p>
<dt>Whence is this learnt? Ah, no! the solemn brow,
<dt>The grave deportment that with careful scan
<dt>Measures each step on level ground and even
<dt>But trips on rough--these may be learnt, we know,
<dt>These have, by that vile beast resembling man;
<dt>But thy philosophy is all from heaven.
