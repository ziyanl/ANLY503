<dt>Dear Nan, at thy command I string a sonnet,
<dt>And must in rhyme surpass the Italian skill,
<dt>Full fourteen lines with flimsy jingle fill.
<dt>What fools we lovers are--I've thus begun it--
<dt>The task is hard, but yet I dare not shun it--
<dt>I'll persevere and bid the muse distil
<dt>Strength in my thought from her inspiring rill.
<dt>Till to the length required I've neatly spun it.
<p>
<dt>But when at length thy fettered bard has done it,
<dt>Poor is the thought--the sentiment how chill!
<dt>See where he stands! Knight of the dashing quill!
<dt>Bewigged a critic, and he'll poop upon it
<dt>But let the witless growler have his will,
<dt>I bargained for thy kiss, and have now fairly won it.
