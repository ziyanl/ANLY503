<p>
<dt>WHEN we are dead I firmly do believe
<dt>We shall slip back into the primal sea
<dt>Of the universal life, that there shall be
<dt>No such false joys as on this earth deceive
<dt>--Nay, nor no truer ones--nor cause to grieve
<dt>Nor terror nor despite nor mockery
<dt>Nor love, life's strongest bitterest mystery
<dt>And while we still are struggling in the strife
<dt>Surely it is a gracious boon though small
<dt>That one brief sweet real joy at least there is,
<dt>To be about to die and know that all
<dt>The anguish and the agony of life
<dt>Will not last longer than a lover's kiss.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>John Keats</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>IF thou canst not from some superior sphere
<dt>Look down upon this world that gave thee birth
<dt>Or from some glad abode of stingless mirth
<dt>Bend hitherward thy godbright head to hear
<dt>Some rainbow-winged etherial messenger
<dt>Tell thee men worship now thy wondrous worth,
<dt>If thou art not, having passed away from earth,
<dt>If thou whose name all sons of song revere
<dt>Art nothing but the shadow of a name,
<dt>If through the whole allotted period
<dt>Of thy brief life thou were allowed to dwell
<dt>In endless bitter ignorance of thy fame,
<dt>Then must we yield it that there is no God
<dt>Or else that he is crueller than hell.

<p>
<dt>ALL too grotesque our thoughts are sometimes. Odd,
<dt>That there will come a day when you and I
<dt>Shall not be you and I! that we shall lie--
<dt>We two--i' the damp earth-mould--above each clod
<dt>A drunken headstone in the neglected sod--
<dt>Thereon the phrase, "Hic Jacet," carved awry,
<dt>And then our virtues, Bah! and piety--
<dt>Perhaps some cheeky reference to God!
<dt>And haply after many a century
<dt>Some spectacled old man shall drive the birds
<dt>A moment from their song i' the lonely spot
<dt>And make a copy of the quaint old words--
<dt>They will then be quaint and old--and all for what?
<dt>To fill a gap in a genealogy.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Philosophy</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I SOMETIMES long to throw my books away
<dt>And to forget the thoughts that make me sad--
<dt>The mighty musings that have ever clad
<dt>The minds of men in chill and sombre grey.
<dt>I sometimes long to laugh out and be gay
<dt>As some blithe, thoughtless, merry-hearted lad
<dt>Or wander in the forest and be glad
<dt>Without a memory of a heavier day;
<dt>Yet when I try to turn myself apart
<dt>From all the deeper mysteries of Life
<dt>In nature-love and hate of human strife,
<dt>Still the same thoughts throng through my throbbing brain
<dt>And I arise in heaviness of heart
<dt>And turn me to my studying again.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The Old Pine</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>IT stood upon the hill like some old chief,
<dt>And held communion with the cryptic wind,
<dt>Keeping like some dim unforgotten grief
<dt>The memory of the tribesmen autumn-skinned,
<dt>Silent and slow as clouds, whose footing passed
<dt>Down the remote trails of oblivion
<dt>Long since into the caverns of the past.
<dt>Alone, aloof, strong fellow of the sun,
<dt>We chose it for our standard in its prime,
<dt>Nor--though no longer grimly from its hill
<dt>It fronts the world, like Webster--wind nor time
<dt>Has felled its austere ghost, we see it still,
<dt>In alien lands, resurgent and undying
<dt>Flag of our hearts, from sudden ramparts flying.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>In Memoriam (A. H. Quint)</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>MOURN we who honored him but knew him not;
<dt>Grieve ye who loved him, looking on his face;
<dt>Be mindful, Dartmouth, of each strenuous trace
<dt>That keeps his loyal record unforgot.
<dt>There is no faithlessness in grief, God wot;
<dt>However high the hope or clear the gaze,
<dt>There must be tears at every burial-place,
<dt>Though through the tears the very sky be shot.
<dt>For death is like the passing of a star
<dt>That melts into the splendor of the dawn.
<dt>Were we beyond the air that blurs our sight
<dt>In the clear ether where the angels are,
<dt>We should behold it still; but now, withdrawn
<dt>In sunrise, lose it, looking on the light.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>Squab Flights</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>"LOVE is eternal," sang I long ago
<dt>Of some light love that lasted for a day;
<dt>But when the fleeting fancy passed away,
<dt>And other loves, that following made as though
<dt>They were the very deathless, lost the glow
<dt>Youth mimics the divine with, and grew gray,
<dt>I said, "It is a dream: no love will stay."
<dt>Angels have taught me wisdom. Now I know,
<dt>Though lesser loves and greater loves may cease,
<dt>Love still endures, knocking at myriad gates
<dt>That lead to God--stars, winds and waters, birds,
<dt>Beasts, flowers and men--speaking its sweetest words
<dt>At woman's portal, till it finds its peace
<dt>In the abyss where Godhead loves and waits.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>Kronos</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As one of those huge monsters of the sky,
<dt>Fierce with the flame of fiery floating hair,
<dt>Falls from the zenith through the upper air,
<dt>Hurling the planets from their paths on high,
<dt>Jarring creation from its harmony,
<dt>Spreading on earth destruction and despair,
<dt>Terrifying men to the temples and vain prayer,
<dt>So from the summit of his majesty
<dt>He fails, and heaven is shaken as flame; Zeus reigns
<dt>Usurping; and no matter what is left--
<dt>How smooth or tangled grows his god-life's weft--
<dt>With how swift footing or how slow the years,
<dt>Speed on, for him forever there remains
<dt>A thunder and a chaos in the spheres.

<p>
<dt>POET! thou art to me a faery king
<dt>Dwelling in some weird place of witchery,
<dt>Some garden where unnumbered roses vie
<dt>In color with the hollyhocks that spring
<dt>On every side in scarlet wantoning
<dt>And lilies'neath the gaudier herbage lie
<dt>And violets unclose their leaves near by
<dt>While stately sunflowers guard each opening.
<dt>And in that garden-realm magnificent
<dt>I often see thee walking-stopping now
<dt>To list to hollow murmurs, now to scent
<dt>Some flower's subtle perfume, wherein, pent,
<dt>A rich, rare pleasance lies that none but thou
<dt>And thy strange fellow-bard, the wind, can know.
<p>
<dt>Oft, too, I see thee on the rocky shore,
<dt>Worshipping all the infinitely strong
<dt>Grand godhead that to ocean doth belong,
<dt>Or prostrate with uncovered head before
<dt>The sun, whom even Ocean doth adore,
<dt>Who giveth speech to every poet's tongue,
<dt>Who is the only king and god of song,
<dt>From whom all bards receive their secret lore.
<dt>For thou art brother of the elements;
<dt>There is a spirit of kinship that compels
<dt>Your feet to stray in paths, where nothing dwells
<dt>Save the triune power that knows not death nor birth
<dt>But sways all nature in omnipotence--
<dt>Sea, wind and sun, the gods who rule the earth.
<p>
<dt>I, also standing where the white caps seem,
<dt>In inextinguishable laughter on the shore,
<dt>Forever tumbling and where, glancing o'er
<dt>The sandy beach, the sun-god's arrows gleam,
<dt>Bright as the swords of Eden's cherubim,
<p>
<dt>Here, on this coast mind-seen of bards of your
<dt>Atlantis, the lost world now found once more,
<dt>This land whereof the Hellene did dream--
<dt>I cast this sea-shell into the great sea
<dt>And all the old Greek spirit in me prays
<dt>To great Poseidon, whom we both adore,
<dt>To cast it up upon the other shore,
<dt>Where it may meet thine Apollonian gaze
<dt>And murmur sweetlier, being seen of thee.

<a name=100></a><h2>College Days</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3><i>For the Fly-Leaf of an Autograph Album</i></h3>
<p>
<dt>THESE college days of jollity and mirth  How pleasurable are they and how serene,
<dt>Just tinged with sorrow enough to welcome in
<dt>With heartier joy all wassail that gives birth
<dt>To bliss that lifts the spirit from the earth!
<dt>Shall not this book and the signatures herein
<dt>Of men whose friendship I am glad to win,
<dt>Years hence recall this time that knows no dearth
<dt>Of ready jests and sunshine of sweet lays
<dt>And vintages of Xeres and the Rhine?
<dt>Ah! the remembrance of these happy days,
<dt>The music and the laughter and the wit,
<dt>The cups that smile with glimmering of sweet wine
<dt>Age shall grow mellow with the thought of it.
<p>
<a name=110></a><h2>Dante Gabriel Rossetti</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>GONE art thou, then, O mystical musician!
<dt>Pure-thoughted singer of these sinful years!
<dt>No more shall dreams and doubts and hopes and fears
<dt>Pass and repass before thy stricken vision;
<dt>No more from thine high sorrowing position
<dt>Shall fall thy song-irradiated tears;
<dt>Alas! no more against our listening years
<dt>Shall new lays ring from thy lone lute elysian.
<dt>For unto thee at last has rest been given,
<dt>Whether in sleep eternal by the shore
<dt>Of Time's wide ocean or in song without
<dt>Or break or flaw, by the gold bar of that heaven
<dt>From which the Blessed Damozel leaned out,
<dt>Sighing for thee in the sad days of yore.
<p>
<a name=120></a><h2>The South</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>AH! where the hot wind, with sweet odors laden,
<dt>Against the roses faintly beats his wings,
<dt>Uttering mild melodious murmurings
<dt>To the faint flowers and the fluttering gladen,
<dt>Whispering of some far, sunset-bowered Aidenn,
<dt>And in an orange tree an oriole sings,
<dt>Whereunder lies, dreaming of unknown things,
<dt>With orange blossoms wreathed, a radiant maiden--
<dt>There is the poet's land; there would I lie
<dt>Beneath the shadows of magnolia trees
<dt>And let my eyes grow languid and my mouth
<dt>Glow with the kisses of the amorous breeze
<dt>And breathe with every breath the luxury
<dt>Of the hot-cheeked, sweet, heavy-lidded South.
