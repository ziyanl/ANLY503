<p>
<dt>Time! thou destroyest the relics of the past,
<dt>And hidest all the footprints of thy march
<dt>On shattered column and on crumbled arch,
<dt>By moss and ivy growing green and fast.
<dt>Hurled into fragments by the tempest-blast
<dt>The Rhodian monster lies; the obelisk
<dt>That with sharp line divided the broad disk
<dt>Of Egypt's sun, down to the sands was cast:
<dt>And where these stood, no remnant-trophy stands,
<dt>And even the art is dead by which they rose:
<dt>Thus, with the monuments of other lands,
<dt>The place that knew them now no longer knows.
<dt>Yet triumph not, O, Time; strong towers decay,
<dt>But a great name shall never pass away.

<h3>I</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>What though my years are falling like thy leaves,
<dt>Oh, Autumn!  When the winds are plumed with night--
<dt>They have thy colors, thy enameled light,
<dt>And all the fullness of thy ripened sheaves.
<dt>Of verdant joys aggressive Time bereaves,
<dt>And the glad transports of unclouded dawn;
<dt>But though the shadows deepen on Life's lawn,
<dt>Rays of serene and solemn beauty shed
<dt>A mellow lustre on my fading hours,
<dt>And with a calm and tempered joy I tread
<dt>Paths still bedecked with iridescent flowers--
<dt>Like thine, oh, Autumn! ere the sober gray
<dt>Of Winter steals thy glorious tints away.
<p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Upon an eminence I seem to stand,
<dt>And look around me. Backward I survey
<dt>A lovely prospect, stretching far away
<dt>Through mists that curtain all the nearer land.
<dt>There once I wandered gayly, hand in hand
<dt>With the companions of my happy spring;
<dt>It was Life's realm of Fairy, rainbow-spanned,
<dt>Where birds and brooks together loved to sing,
<dt>And every cloud made pictures as it sailed.
<dt>That music yet resounds, those pictures shine
<dt>Through the far distance Time has faintly veiled,
<dt>Though many a rock, stream, valley intervene
<dt>Between me and that fairy-haunted scene.

<h4>To my friend, the Rev. Walter Colton, author of "Deck and Port" and "Three Years in California," who died, having been long absent from home, shortly after rejoining his family. (<i>Harper's Monthly</i>, 1853)</h4>
<p></p>
<dt>Heart, that with warm and generous feeling beat--
<dt>How strange it seems to one who loved thee well,
<dt>That over thee has pealed the solemn knell,
<dt>And not one spark of all that genial heat
<dt>Remains each high-born sympathy to greet,
<dt>And glow with fond affection, when some word
<dt>Uttered in tone harmonious, low, and sweet,
<dt>Thy fervent depths to kind emotions stirred!
<dt>Alas--that thou, when life was doubly dear,
<dt>When once more reunited to thine own,
<dt>After such weary years of absence flown,
<dt>Should'st be translated--though to that bright sphere
<dt>On which, in child-like earnestness and faith,
<dt>Thy looks were turned beyond the door of death.

<h3>(Written in view of the harbor of New York on the loveliest and calmest of 
the last days of autumn.)</h3>      
<dt>Is this a painting?&nbsp; Are those pictured clouds
<dt>Which on the sky so movelessly repose?
<dt>Has some rare artist fashioned forth the shrouds
<dt>Of yonder vessel?&nbsp; Are these imaged shows
<dt>Of outline, figure, form, or is there life—
<dt>Life with a thousand pulses— in the scene
<dt>We gaze upon?&nbsp; Those towering banks between,
<dt>E'er tossed these billows in tumultuous strife?
<dt>      &nbsp;
<dt>Billows!&nbsp; there's not a wave!&nbsp; the waters spread
<dt> One broad, unbroken mirror!&nbsp; all around
<dt>Is hushed to silence,— silence so profound
<dt>That a bird's carol, or an arrow sped
<dt>Into the distance, would, like larum bell,
<dt>Jar the deep stillness and dissolve the 
spell!</dt>
