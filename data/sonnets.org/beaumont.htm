<dt>A nymph is dead, mild, virtuous, young, and fair;
<dt>Death never counts by days, or months, or years:
<dt>Oft in his sight the infant old appears,
<dt>And to his earthly mansion must repair.
<dt>Why should our sighs disturb the quiet air?
<dt>For when the flood of Time to ruin bears,
<dt>No beauty can prevail, nor parents' tears.
<dt>When life is gone, we of the flesh despair,
<dt>Yet still the happy soul immortal lives
<dt>In Heaven, as we with pious hope conceive;
<dt>And to the Maker endless praises gives,
<dt>That she so soon this loathsome world might leave.
<dt>We judge that glorious spirit doubly blest,
<dt>Which from short life ascends t'eternal rest.
