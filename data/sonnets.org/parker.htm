<p>
<dt>When you and I have play'd the little hour,
<dt>Have seen the tall subaltern Life to Death
<dt>Yield up his sword; and, smiling, draw the breath,
<dt>The first long breath of freedom; when the flower
<dt>Of Recompense hath flutter'd to our feet,
<dt>As to an actor's; and, the curtain down,
<dt>We turn to face each other all alone--
<dt>Alone, we two, who never yet did meet,
<dt>Alone, and absolute, and free: O then,
<dt>O then, most dear, how shall be told the tale?
<dt>Clasp'd hands, press'd lips, and so clasp'd hands again;
<dt>No words. But as the proud wind fills the sail,
<dt>My love to yours shall reach, then one deep moan
<dt>Of joy, and then our infinite. Alone.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Art's Use</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Art's use! what is it but to touch the springs
<dt>Of nature? But to hold a torch up for 
<dt>Humanity in Life's large corridor,
<dt>To guide the feet of peasants and of kings!
<dt>What is it but to carry union through
<dt>Thoughts alien to thoughts kindred, and to merge
<dt>The lines of colour that should not diverge,
<dt>And give the sun a window to shine through!
<dt>What is it but to make the world have heed
<dt>For what its dull eyes else would hardly scan!
<dt>To draw in a stark light a shameless deed,
<dt>And show the fashion of a kingly man!
<dt>To cherish honour, and to smite all shame,
<dt>To lend hearts voices, and give thoughts a name!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Love's Comradeship</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It is enough that in this burdened time
<dt>The soul sees all its purposes aright.
<dt>The rest--what does it matter? Soon the night
<dt>Will come to whelm us, then the morning chime.
<dt>What does it matter, if but in the way
<dt>One hand clasps ours, one heart believes us true;
<dt>One understands the work we try to do,
<dt>And strives through Love to teach us what to say?
<dt>Between me and the chilly outer air
<dt>Which blows in from the world, there standeth one
<dt>Who draws Love's curtains closely everywhere,
<dt>As God folds down the banners of the sun.
<dt>Warm is my place about me, and above,
<dt>Where was the raven, I behold the dove.
