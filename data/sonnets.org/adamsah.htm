<p>
<dt>I thought, because we had been friends so long,
<dt>That I knew all your dear lips dared intend
<dt>Before they dawned to speech. Our thoughts would blend,
<dt>I dreamed, like memories that faintly throng.
<dt>Your voice dwelt in me like an olden song.
<dt>Petal, I thought, from petal I could rend
<dt>The blossom of your soul, and at the end
<dt>Find still the same sweet fragrance. I was wrong.
<dt>Last evening in our eyes love brimmed to birth;
<dt>Our friendship faded, lost in passion's mist.
<dt>We had been strangers only! Here, close-caught
<dt>Against my heart the dim face I had sought
<dt>So long! And now the only thing on earth--
<dt>Your piteous mouth, a-tremble to be kissed!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>A Spring Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Last night beneath the mockery of the moon
<dt>I heard the sudden startled whisperings
<dt>Of wakened birds settling their restless wings;
<dt>The North-east brought his word of gladness, "Soon!"
<dt>And all the night with wonder was a-swoon.
<dt>A soul had breathed into long-dreaming things;
<dt>Some unseen hand hovered above the strings:
<dt>Some cosmic chord had set the earth in tune.
<dt>And when I rose I saw the Bay arrayed
<dt>In her grey robe against the coming heat.
<dt>A pulse awoke within the stirring street--
<dt>The wattle-gold upon the pavements thrown,
<dt>And through the quiet of the colonnade
<dt>The smoky perfume of boronia blown.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Sydney</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In her grey majesty of ancient stone
<dt>She queens it proudly, though the sun's caress
<dt>Her piteous cheeks, ravished of bloom, confess,
<dt>And her dark eyes his bridegroom glance have know.
<dt>Robed in her flowing parks, serene, alone,
<dt>She fronts the east; and with the tropic stress
<dt>Her smooth brow ripples into weariness;
<dt>Yet hers the sea for footstool, and for throne
<dt>A continent predestined. Round her trails
<dt>The turbid squalor of her streets, and dim
<dt>Into the dark heat-haze her domes flow up;
<dt>Her long lean fingers, with their grey-old nails,
<dt>Giving her thirsty lips to the cool brim
<dt>Of the bronze beauty of her harbour's cup.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>China (1899)</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>She lies, a grave disdain all her defence,
<dt>Too imperturbable for scorn. She hears
<dt>Only the murmur of the flowing years
<dt>That thunder slowly on her shores immense
<dt>And ebb away in moaning impotence.
<dt>Giants enduring, she and Time are peers--
<dt>Her dream-hazed eyes knowing no hopes, no tears,
<dt>Her glance a langour-lidded insolence.
<dt>And though the rabble of the restless West
<dt>In her deserted courts set their rash sway,
<dt>She heeds them not; as when the sun, withdrawn
<dt>From his untarnished sky, knows it distressed
<dt>By storm of weakling stars, that he at dawn
<dt>Will wither with one ruthless glance away.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Nemesis</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>All things must fade. There is for cities tall
<dt>The same tomorrow as for daffodils:
<dt>Time's wind, that casts the seed, the petal spills.
<dt>Grim London's ruined arches yet shall fall
<dt>Back to the arms of Earth. A quiet pall
<dt>The mother draws over those she loves--and kills;
<dt>And though brief nations vaunt their upstart wills,
<dt>The nemesis of grass shall cover all.
<dt>So--from a caravan to Mecca bound
<dt>Getting no more than one incurious glance--
<dt>Tremendous Babylon, thrice-girt with walls,
<dt>Sick of her thousand years of arrogance,
<dt>With a few tamarisks upon a mound
<dt>Her epigraph upon the desert scrawls.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Civilization</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>One moment mankind rides the crested wave,
<dt>A moment glorious, beyond recall;
<dt>And then the wave, with slow and massive fall,
<dt>Obliterates the beauty that it gave.
<dt>When discrowned king and manumitted slave
<dt>Are free and equal to be slaves of all,
<dt>Democracies in their wide freedom brawl,
<dt>And go down shouting to a common grave.
<dt>So one by one the petals of the rose
<dt>Shrivel and fade, and all its splendour goes
<dt>Back to the earth; and in her arms embraced
<dt>Through wintry centuries the dead seeds sleep
<dt>Till spring comes troubling them, and they unleap,
<dt>Once more their petals on the world to waste.
