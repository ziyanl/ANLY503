<p>Thanks to Nelson Miller for sending along this sequence of sonnets (Henley himself referred to them as "quatorzains") and one concluding non-sonnet written in 1898 to accompany a series of paintings of London street life by William Nicholson at Nicholson's request.

<a name=001></a><h2>I.  'Bus Driver</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>He's called <i>The General</i> from the brazen craft
<dt>And dash with which he <i>sneaks a bit of road</i>
<dt>And all its fares; challenged, or chafed, or chaffed,
<dt><i>Back-answers</i> of the newest he'll explode;
<dt>He reins his horses with an air; he treats
<dt>With scoffing calm whatever powers there be;
<dt>He <i>gets it straight</i>, puts <i>a bit on</i>, and meets
<dt>His losses with both <i>lip</i> and &#163; <i>s. d.</i> ;
<dt>He arrogates a special taste in <i>short</i>;
<dt>Is loftily grateful for a flagrant <i>smoke</i>;
<dt>At all the smarter housemaids winks his court,
<dt>And taps them for half-crowns; being <i>stoney-broke</i>,
<dt>Lives lustily; is ever <i>on the make</i>;
<dt>And hath, I fear, none other gods but <i>Fake</i>.
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>II.  Life-Guardsman</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Joy of the Milliner, Envy of the Line,
<dt>Star of the Parks, jack-booted, sworded, helmed,
<dt>He sits between his holsters, solid of spine;
<dt>Nor, as it seems, though Westminster were whelmed,
<dt>With the great globe, in earthquake and eclipse,
<dt>Would he and his charger cease from mounting guard,
<dt>This Private in the Blues, nor would his lips
<dt>Move, though his gorge with throttled oaths were charred!
<dt>He wears his inches weightily, as he wears
<dt>His old-world armours; and with his port and pride,
<dt>His sturdy graces and enormous airs,
<dt>He towers, in speech his Colonel countrified,
<dt>A triumph, waxing statelier year by year,
<dt>Of British blood, and bone, and beef, and beer.
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>III.  Hawker</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Far out of bounds he'd figured--in a race
<dt>Of West-End traffic pitching to his loss.
<dt>But if you'd see him in his proper place,
<dt>Making the <i>browns</i> for <i>bub</i> and <i>grub</i> and <i>doss</i>,
<dt>Go East among the merchants and their men,
<dt>And where the press in noisiest, and the tides
<dt>Of trade run highest and widest, there and then
<dt>You shall behold him, edging with equal strides
<dt>Along the kerb; hawking in either hand
<dt>Some artful nothing made of twine and tin,
<dt>Cardboard and foil and bits of rubber band:
<dt>Some penn'orth of wit-in-fact that, with a grin,
<dt>The careful City marvels at, and buys
<dt>For nurselings in the Suburbs to despise!
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>IV.  Beef-Eater</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>His beat lies knee-high through a dust of story--
<dt>A dust of terror and torture, grief and crime;
<dt>Ghosts that are England's wonder, and shame, and glory
<dt>Throng where he walks, an antic of old time;
<dt>A sense of long immedicable tears
<dt>Were ever with him, could his ears but heed;
<dt>The stern <i>Hic Jacets</i> of our bloodiest years
<dt>Are for his reading, had he eyes to read,
<dt>But here, where Crookback raged, and Cranmer trimmed,
<dt>And More and Strafford faced the axe's proving,
<dt>He shows that Crown the desperate Colonel nimmed,
<dt>Or simply keeps the Country Cousin moving,
<dt>Or stays such Cockney pencillers as would shame
<dt>The wall where some dead Queen hath traced her name.
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>V.  Sandwich-Man</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>An ill March noon; the flagstones gray with dust;
<dt>An all-round east wind volleying straws and grit;
<dt>St. Martin's Steps, where every venomous gust
<dt>Lingers to buffet, or sneap, the passing cit;
<dt>And in the gutter, squelching a rotten boot,
<dt>Draped in a wrap that, modish ten-year syne,
<dt>Partners, obscene with sweat and grease and soot,
<dt>A horrible hat, that once was just as fine;
<dt>The drunkard's mouth a-wash for something drinkable,
<dt>The drunkard's eye alert for causal <i>toppers</i>,
<dt>The drunkard's neck stooped to a lot scarce thinkable,
<dt>A living crawling blazoning of Hot-Coppers,
<dt>He trails his mildews towards a Kingdom-Come
<dt>Compact of <i>sausage-and-mash</i> and <i>two-o'rum</i>!
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>VI.  'Liza</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>'Liza's <i>old man</i>'s perhaps a little shady,
<dt>'Liza's <i>old woman</i>'s prone to booze and cring;
<dt>But 'Liza deems herself <i>a perfect lady</i>,
<dt>And proves it in her feathers and her fringe.
<dt>For 'Liza has a <i>bloke</i> her heart to cheer,
<dt>With <i>pearlies</i> and a <i>barrer</i> and a <i>jack</i>,
<dt>So all the vegetables of the year
<dt>Are duly represented on her back.
<dt>Her boots are sacrifices to her hats,
<dt>Which knock you speechless--<i>like a load of bricks</i>!
<dt>Her summer velvets dazzle Wanstead Flats,
<dt>And cost, at times, a good eighteen-and-six.
<dt>Withal, outside the gay and giddy whirl,
<dt>'Liza's a stupid, straight, hard-working girl.
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>VII.  "Lady"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Time, the old humourist, has a trick to-day
<dt>Of moving landmarks and of levelling down,
<dt>Till into Town the Suburbs edge their way,
<dt>And in the Suburbs you may scent the Town.
<dt>With Mount Street thus approaching Muswell Hill,
<dt>And Clapham Common marching with the Mile,
<dt>You get a Hammersmith that <i>fills the bill</i>,
<dt>A Hampstead with a serious sense of style.
<dt>So this fair creature, pictured in The Row,
<dt>As one of that "gay adulterous world," whose round
<dt>Is by the Serpentine, as well would show,
<dt>And might, I deem, as readily be found
<dt>On Streatham's Hill, or Wimbledon's, or where
<dt>Brixtonian kitchens lard the late-dining air.
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>VII.  Bluecoat Boy</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>So went our boys when Edward Sixth, the King,
<dt>Chartered Christ's Hospital, and died.  And so
<dt>Full fifteen generations in a string
<dt>Of heirs to his bequest have had to go.
<dt>Thus Camden showed, and Barnes, and Stillingfleet,
<dt>And Richardson, that bade our Lovelace be;
<dt>Thus to his Genevieve young S. T. C.
<dt>With thousands else that, wandering up and down,
<dt>Quaint, privileged, liked and reputed well,
<dt>Made the great School a part of London Town
<dt>Patent as Paul's and vital as Bow Bell:
<dt>The old School nearing exile, day by day,
<dt>To certain clay-lands somewhere Horsham way.
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>IX.  Mounted Police</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Army Reserve; a worshipper of Bobs,
<dt>With whom he stripped the smock from Candahar;
<dt>Neat as his mount, that neatest among cobs;
<dt>Whenever pageants pass, or meetings are,
<dt>He moves conspicuous, vigilant, severe,
<dt>With his Light Cavalry hand and seat and look,
<dt>A living type of Order, in whose sphere
<dt>Is room for neither <i>Hooligan</i> nor <i>Hook</i>.
<dt>For in his shadow, wheresoe'er he ride,
<dt>Paces, all eye and hardihood and grip,
<dt>The dreaded <i>Crusher</i>, might in his every stride
<dt>And right materialized girt at his hip;
<dt>And they, that shake to see these twain go by,
<dt>Feel that the <i>Tec</i>, that plain-clothes Terror, is nigh.
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>X.  News-Boy</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Take any station, pavement, circus, corner,
<dt>Where men their styles of print may call or choose,
<dt>And there--ten times more <i>on it</i> than Jack Horner--
<dt>There you shall find him swathed in sheets of news.
<dt>Nothing can stay the placing of his wares--
<dt>Not 'bus, nor cab, nor dray!  The very <i>Slop</i>,
<dt>That imp of power, is powerless!  Ever he dares,
<dt>And, daring, lands his public neck and crop.
<dt>Even the many-tortured London ear,
<dt>The much-enduring, loathes his <i>Speeshul</i> yell,
<dt>His shriek of <i>Winnur!</i>  But his dart and leer
<dt>And poise are irresistible.  Pall Mall
<dt>Joys in him, and Mile End; for his vocation
<dt>Is to purvey the stuff of conversation.
<p>
<a name=011></a><h2>XI.  Drum-Major</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Who says <i>Drum-Major</i> says a man of mould,
<dt>Shaking the meek earth with tremendous tread,
<dt>And pacing still, a triumph to behold,
<dt>Of his own spine at least two yards ahead!
<dt>Attorney, grocer, surgeon, broker, duke--
<dt>His calling may be anything, who comes
<dt>Into a room, his presence a rebuke
<dt>To the dejected, as the pipes and drums
<dt>Inspired his port!--who mounts his office stairs
<dt>As though he led great armies to the fight!
<dt>His bulk itself's pure genius, and he wears
<dt>His avoirdupois with so much fire and spright
<dt>That, though the creature stands but five feet five,
<dt>You take him for the tallest He alive.
<p>
<a name=012></a><h2>XII.  Flower-Girl</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There's never a delicate nurseling of the year
<dt>But our huge London hails it, and delights
<dt>To wear it on her breast or at her ear,
<dt>Her days to colour and make sweet her nights.
<dt>Crocus and daffodil and violet,
<dt>Pink, primrose, valley-lily, close-carnation,
<dt>Red rose and white rose, wall-flower, mignonette,
<dt>The daisies all--these be her recreation,
<dt>Her gaudies these!  And forth from Drury Lane,
<dt>Trapesing in any of her whirl of weathers,
<dt>Her flower-girls foot it, honest and hoarse and vain,
<dt>All boot and little shawl and wilted feathers:
<dt>Of populous corners right advantage taking,
<dt>And, where they squat, endlessly posy-making.
<p>
<a name=013></a><h2>XIII.  Barmaid</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Though, if you ask her name, she says "Elise,"
<dt>Being plain Elizabeth, e'en let it pass,
<dt>And own that, if her aspirates take their ease,
<dt>She ever makes a point, in washing glass,
<dt>Handling the engine, turning taps for <i>tots</i>,
<dt>And countering change, and scorning what men say,
<dt>Of posing as a dove among the pots,
<dt>Nor often gives her dignity away.
<dt>Her head's a work of art, and, if her eyes
<dt>Be tired and ignorant, she has a waist;
<dt>Cheaply the Mode she shadows; and she tries
<dt>From penny novels to amend her taste;
<dt>And, having mopped the zinc for certain years,
<dt>And faced the gas, she fades and disappears.
<p>
<a name=014></a><h2>The Artist Muses at His Ease</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The Artist muses at his ease,
<dt>Contented that his work is done,
<dt>And smiling--smiling!--as he sees
<dt>His crowd collecting, one by one.
<dt>Alas! his travail's but begun!
<dt>None, none can keep the years in line,
<dt>And what to Ninety-Eight is fun
<dt>May raise the gorge of Ninety-Nine!
<br>
