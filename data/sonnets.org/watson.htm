<H2>The World in Armor</H2>
<h3>1</h3>
<p>
<dt>Under this shade of crimson wings abhorred
<dt>That never wholly leaves the sky serene,
<dt>While Vengeance sleeps a sleep so light, between
<dt>Dominions that acclaim Thee overlord--
<dt>Sadly the blast of Thy tremendous word,
<dt>Whate'er its mystic purport may have been,
<dt>Echoes across the ages, Nazarene:
<dt><i>Not to bring peace Mine errand, but a sword.</i>
<dt>For lo, Thy world uprises and lies down
<dt>In armor, and its Peace is War, in all
<dt>Save the great death that weaves War's dreadful crown;
<dt>War unennobled by heroic pain,
<dt>War without triumph, without glorious fall;
<dt>War that sits smiling, with the eyes of Cain.
<p>

<p>
<dt>When London's Plague, that day by day enrolled
<dt>His thousands dead, nor deigned his rage to abate
<dt>Till grass was green in silent Bishopsgate,
<dt>Had come and passed like thunder--still, 'tis told,
<dt>The monster, driven to earth, in hovels old
<dt>And haunts obscure, though dormant, lingered late,
<dt>Till the dread Fire, one roaring wave of fate,
<dt>Rose, and swept clean his last retreat and hold.
<dt>In Europe live the dregs of Plague today,
<dt>Dregs of full many an ancient Plague and dire--
<dt>Old wrongs, old lies of ages blind and cruel.
<dt>What if alone the world-war's world-wide fire
<dt>Can purge the ambushed pestilence away?
<dt>Yet woe to him that idly lights the fuel!
<p>

<p>
<dt>A moment's fantasy, the vision came
<dt>Of Europe dipped in fiery death, and so
<dt>Mounting re-born, with vestal limbs aglow,
<dt>Splendid and fragrant from her bath of flame.
<dt>It fleeted; and a phantom without name,
<dt>Sightless, dismembered, terrible, said: "Lo,
<dt><i>I</i> am that ravished Europe men shall know
<dt>After the morn of blood and night of shame."
<dt>The specter passed, and I beheld alone
<dt>The Europe of the present, as she stands,
<dt>Powerless from terror of her own vast power,
<dt>'Neath novel stars, beside a brink unknown;
<dt>And round her the sad Kings, with sleepless hands,
<dt>Piling the fagots, hour by doomful hour.
