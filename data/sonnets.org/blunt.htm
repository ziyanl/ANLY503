<p>"These sonnets are excerpted from the third edition of that remarkable volume, <i>The Love Sonnets of Proteus</i>. They have more of the Shakespearian <i>ring</i> than perhaps any sonnets of our time. That "Proteus" can at times touch a very high note indeed will be understood by any one who reads the sonorous and majestic sonnet on <a href="#080">The Sublime</a>. Structually, they cannot be considered satisfactory." (<a href="bibliogr.htm#sharp1">Sharp</a>.)

<a name=010></a><h2>On Her Vanity</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What are these things thou lovest? Vanity.
<dt>To see men turn their heads when thou dost pass;
<dt>To be the signboard and the looking glass
<dt>Where every idler there may glut his eye;
<dt>To hear men speak thy name mysteriously,
<dt>Wagging their heads. Is it for this, alas,
<dt>That thou hast made a placard of a face
<dt>On which the tears of love were hardly dry?
<dt>What are these things thou lovest? The applause
<dt>Of prostitutes at wit which is not thine;
<dt>The sympathy of shop-boys who would weep
<dt>Their shilling's worth of woe in any cause,
<dt>At any tragedy.--Their tears and mine,
<dt>What difference? Oh truly tears are cheap!
</p>
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>As To His Choice of Her</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If I had chosen thee, thou shouldst have been
<dt>A virgin proud, untamed, immaculate,
<dt>Chaste as the morning star, a saint, a queen,
<dt>Scarred by no wars, no violence of hate.
<dt>Thou shouldst have been of soul commensurate
<dt>With thy fair body, brave and virtuous
<dt>And kind and just; and, if of poor estate,
<dt>At least an honest woman for my house.
<dt>I would have had thee come of honoured blood
<dt>And honourable nurture. Thou shouldst bear
<dt>Sons to my pride and daughters to my heart,
<dt>And men should hold thee happy, wise, and good.
<dt>Lo, thou art none of this, but only fair,
<dt>Yet must I love thee, dear, and as thou art.
</p>
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>To One Who Would Make a Confession</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oh! leave the Past to bury its own dead.
<dt>The Past is naught to us, the Present all.
<dt>What need of last year's leaves to strew Love's bed?
<dt>What need of ghosts to grace a festival?
<dt>I would not, if I could, those days recall,
<dt>Those days not ours. For us the feast is spread,
<dt>The lamps are lit, and music plays withal.
<dt>Then let us love and leave the rest unsaid.
<dt>This island is our home. Around it roar
<dt>Great gulfs and oceans, channels, straits, and seas.
<dt>What matter in what wreck we reached the shore,
<dt>So we both reached it? We can mock at these.
<dt>Oh! leave the Past, if Past indeed there be.
<dt>I would not know it. I would know but thee.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>An Exhortation</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Why do we fret at the inconstancy
<dt>Of our frail hearts, which cannot always love?
<dt>Time rushes onward, and we mortals move
<dt>Like waifs upon a river, neither free
<dt>To halt or hurry. Sweet, if destiny 
<dt>Throws us together for an hour, a day,
<dt>In the backwater of this quiet bay,
<dt>Let us rejoice. Before us lies the sea,
<dt>Where we must all be lost in spite of love.
<dt>We dare not stop to question. Happiness
<dt>Lies in our hand unsought, a treasure trove.
<dt>Time has short patience of man's vain distress;
<dt>And fate grows angry at too long delay,
<dt>And floods rise fast, and we are swept away.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Vanitas Vanitatis</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lame, impotent conclusion to youth's dreams
<dt>Vast as all heaven! See, what glory lies
<dt>Entangled here in these base stratagems,
<dt>What virtue done to death! O glorious sighs,
<dt>Sublime beseechings, high cajoleries,
<dt>Fond wraths, brave raptures, all that sometime was
<dt>Our daily bread of gods beneath the skies,
<dt>How are ye ended, in what utter loss!
<dt>Time was, time is, and time is yet to come,
<dt>Till even time itself shall have an end.
<dt>These were eternal--and behold, a tomb.
<dt>Come, let us laugh and eat and drink. God send
<dt>What all the world must need one day as we,
<dt>Speedy oblivion, rest for memory.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>The Pride of Unbelief</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When I complained that I had lost my hope
<dt>Of life eternal with eternal God;
<dt>When I refused to read my horoscope
<dt>In the unchanging stars, or claim abode
<dt>With powers and dominations--but, poor clod,
<dt>Clung to the earth and grovelled in my tears,
<dt>Because I soon must lie beneath the sod
<dt>And close the little number of my years,--
<dt>Then I was told that pride had barred the way,
<dt>And raised this foul rebellion! I, but yesterday,
<dt>Was God's own son in His own likeness bred.
<dt>And thrice strange pride! who thus am cast away
<dt>And go forth lost and disinherited.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>On the Shortness of Time</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If I could live without the thought of death,
<dt>Forgetful of Time's waste, the soul's decay,
<dt>I would not ask for other joy than breath,
<dt>With light and sound of birds and the sun's ray.
<dt>I could sit on untroubled day by day
<dt>Watching the grass grow, and the wild flowers range
<dt>From blue to yellow and from red to grey
<dt>In natural sequence as the seasons change.
<dt>I could afford to wait, but for the hurt
<dt>Of this dull tick of time which chides my ear.
<dt>But now I dare not sit with loins ungirt
<dt>And staff unlifted, for death stands too near.
<dt>I must be up and doing--ay, each minute.
<dt>The grave gives time for rest when we are in it.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>The Sublime</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>To stand upon a windy pinnacle,
<dt>Beneath the infinite blue of the blue noon,
<dt>And underfoot a valley terrible
<dt>As that dim gulf, where sense and being swoon
<dt>When the soul parts; a giant valley strewn
<dt>With giant rocks; asleep, and vast, and still,
<dt>And far away. The torrent, which has hewn
<dt>His pathway through the entrails of the hill,
<dt>Now crawls along the bottom and anon
<dt>Lifts up his voice, a muffled tremulous roar,
<dt>Borne on the wind an instant, and then gone
<dt>Back to the caverns of the middle air;
<dt>A voice as of a nation overthrown
<dt>With beat of drums, when hosts have marched to war.
