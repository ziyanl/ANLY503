<dt>Fourteen small broidered berries on the hem
<dt>Of Circe's mantle, each of magic gold;
<dt>Fourteen of lone Calypso's tears that rolled
<dt>Into the sea, for pearls to come of them;
<dt>Fourteen clear signs of omen in the gem
<dt>With which Medea human fate foretold;
<dt>Fourteen small drops, which Faustus, growing old,
<dt>Craved of the Fiend, to water Life's dry stem.
<dt>It is the pure white diamond Dante brought
<dt>To Beatrice; the sapphire Laura wore
<dt>When Petrarch cut it sparkling out of thought;
<dt>The ruby Shakespeare hewed from his heart's core;
<dt>The dark, deep emerald that Rossetti wrought
<dt>For his own soul, to wear for evermore.

</p>
<dt>In dim green depths rot ingot-laden ships;
<dt>And gold doubloons, that from the drowned hand fell,
<dt>Lie nestled in the ocean-flower's bell
<dt>With love's old gifts, once kissed by long-drowned lips;
<dt>And round some wrought gold cup the sea-grass whips,
<dt>And hides lost pearls, near pearls still in their shell,
<dt>Where sea-weed forests fill each ocean dell
<dt>And seek dim sunlight with their restless tips.
<dt>So lie the wasted gifts, the long-lost hopes
<dt>Beneath the now hushed surface of myself,
<dt>In lonelier depths than where the diver gropes;
<dt>They lie deep, deep; but I at times behold
<dt>In doubtful glimpses, on some reefy shelf
<dt>The gleam of irrecoverable gold.

<p></p>
<dt>What wast thou, little baby, that art dead--
<dt>A one-day's blossom that the hoar-frost nips?
<dt>A bee that's crusht, the first bright day it sips?
<dt>A small dropt gem that in the earth we tread?
<p></p>
<dt>Or cherub's smiling gold-encircled head,
<dt>That Death from out Life's painted missal rips?
<dt>Or murmured prayer that barely reached the lips?
<dt>Or sonnet's fair first line--the rest unsaid?
<p></p>
<dt>Oh, 'tis not hard to find what thou wast like;
<dt>The world is full of fair unfinished things
<dt>That vanish like a dawn-admonished elf.
<p></p>
<dt>Life teems with opening forms for Death to strike;
<dt>The woods are full of unfledged broken wings;
<dt>Enough for us, thou wast thy baby self.
<p>

<p></p>
<dt>Lo, through the open window of the room
<dt>That was her nursery, a small bright spark
<dt>Comes wandering in, as falls the summer dark,
<dt>And with a measured flight explores the gloom.
<p></p>
<dt>As if it sought, among the things that loom
<dt>Vague in the dusk, for sume familiar mark,
<dt>And like a light on some wee unseen bark,
<dt>It tacks in search of who knows what or whom.
<p></p>
<dt>I know 'tis but a fire-fly; yet its flight,
<dt>So straight, so measured, round the empty bed,
<dt>Might be a little soul's that night sets free;
<p></p>
<dt>And as it nears, I feel my heart grow tight
<dt>With something like a superstitious dread,
<dt>And watch it breathless, lest it should be she.

<dt>The Robin gave three hops, and chirp'd and said:
<dt>"Yes, I knew Puck, and loved him; though I trow
<dt>He mimick'd oft my whistle, chuckling low;
<dt>Yes, I knew cousin Puck; but he is dead.
<p></p>
<dt>We found him lying on his mushroom bed--
<dt>The Wren and I--half cover'd up with snow,
<dt>As we were hopping where the berries grow.
<dt>We think he died of cold. Ay, Puck is fled."
<p></p>
<dt>And then the Wood-Mouse said: "We made the Mole
<dt>Dig him a little grave beneath the moss,
<dt>And four big Dormice placed him in the hole.
<p></p>
<dt>The Squirrel made with sticks a little cross;
<dt>Puck was a Christian elf, and had a soul;
<dt>And all we velvet jackets mourn his loss."
