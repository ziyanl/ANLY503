<p>
<dt>Now he recalleth his triumphant days,
<dt>And fervid throes of equatorial fire
<dt>Thrill through his frame, till re-aroused desire
<dt>(His dream so shows him all his desert ways)
<dt>To lap the scented blood of what he slays,
<dt>Lifts him upon his feet; a lurid ire
<dt>Burns in his eyes, a shaggy horror stays
<dt>His mane erect in aspect grim and dire.
<p>
<dt>His eyes that are the mirror of his dream,
<dt>As slowly from their deeps the vision fades
<dt>Lose all the light wherewith they blazed and shone,
<dt>His limbs relent, and all the savage gleam
<dt>Droops in his mane to ever gloomier shades,
<dt>And with his sleep his royal mood is gone.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Fate</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Our fate is round us like a viewless net,
<dt>Woven of thoughts, inheritances, deeds,
<dt>And all the drift of circumstantial weeds
<dt>About the shores of being that are set,
<dt>Imponderable strands no mortal fret
<dt>Hath power to fray; the inevitable seeds
<dt>Sown by the gods along the cosmic meads
<dt>(The gods who sow and never know regret)
<dt>Throw round us their invisible intents;
<dt>Webs knitted in the house of destiny
<dt>Enmesh the yearning visage of the soul,
<dt>And though it cry, the sequence of events,
<dt>The march and order of the mighty whole
<dt>Remain unchanged through all eternity.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Flowers</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Roses I saw, and poppies all alight
<dt>With colours of the dawn, and rainbow hues
<dt>Drawn from the sun and all the secret dews
<dt>Distilled upon them from the brooding night,
<dt>And delicate sweet-peas so purely dight
<dt>They must have grown where icy winds refuse
<dt>To blow, or haply where nuns dream and muse
<dt>In holy meditation, out of sight
<dt>Of the rough world;--flowers of moonlight sheen
<dt>And golden hearts, and velvet pansies turned
<dt>The room they stood in to a garden scene
<dt>Of loveliness so exquisite, I yearned
<dt>Through all my soul to be as chastely clean
<dt>As these, and more my raptured eye discerned.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Drought</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lo! all the land is dry and parched with heat,
<dt>And all the hills are white with withered grass
<dt>That hath no touch of greenness; and, alas!
<dt>See how the lately waving fields of wheat
<dt>Droop wearily towards a sure defeat
<dt>Before the scorching winds that hourly pass
<dt>Over the arid earth; how like a glass,
<dt>The hot flats shimmer underneath the heat,
<dt>More strenuous as the stifling weeks increase,
<dt>Of quenchless and unmitigable rays,
<dt>That make a terror of the rainless days;
<dt>And the clear vault of fire, that will not cease
<dt>To heap with death the long and dusty ways,
<dt>And burn out life from all the leafless trees.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Spring</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Green grass, green trees, and greenest wildernesses
<dt>Of cool green ferns; and ah! such long green spaces
<dt>Sleeping within the sunlight's warm embraces!
<dt>Green-shadowed rills that gurgle through green cresses,
<dt>And deep green nooks wherein the locust dresses
<dt>Her shining wings; green dells, and high green places
<dt>O'er which bright swarms of sportive insect graces
<dt>Flash and are gone, and know not what distress is;
<dt>Green-covered spots; green fields where greenness less is
<dt>By reason of the clouds of blowing daisies
<dt>That variegate the verdure with their faces;
<dt>Green arbours where all greenest loveliness is
<dt>Like little billowy puffs of maiden tresses!
<dt>All these leave on the soul their joyous traces.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Morning</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Slow mists were on the ridges all around,
<dt>And in the kloofs; and on the mountain-side
<dt>They moved and swayed, a softly flowing tide
<dt>That rose against the rocks without a sound,
<dt>Then circled back upon the lower ground
<dt>In folding mazes that would not abide
<dt>A moment there, but wandered far and wide
<dt>In billowy waves no shores were set to bound.
<p>
<dt>Our raptured souls were in that magic sea,
<dt>And in those wreaths that journeyed with the wind
<dt>Were all our thoughts, and in each eager mind
<dt>The beauty of that morning mystery
<dt>Became an exultation, yet to be
<dt>Remembered when our mortal eyes are blind.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>The Mountain Top</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What witching hours of wild delight are here!
<dt>What amplitude of healing airs that sweep
<dt>Downward to rouse the dreamers from their sleep
<dt>Far in unhealthful valleys! and what cheer
<dt>Of gleeful laughter wins the soul from fear
<dt>To gambol on these lusty heights like sheep
<dt>Glad with the spring! In what still pools and deep
<dt>Shine spaces of the crystal atmosphere!
<dt>What flowers are here! what scented dells of shade!
<dt>What carols make the mornings musical!
<dt>What fragrant coils of everlastings glow
<dt>In secret spots along each sinuous glade!
<dt>What luminous waters rush and pause to fall!
<dt>What exultations through the spirit flow!
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>The First Dawn</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What blackness reigned before a star was born?
<dt>When far across void spaces of the night
<dt>The pale diaphanous wonder of the dawn
<dt>Rose ghostlike on the unaccustomed sight
<dt>Of all the unimaginable eyes
<dt>(Strange creatures of the darkness sure were bred)
<dt>That stared towards the east in wild surmise,
<dt>To see the changing colours throb and spread,
<dt>Innumerable films of rosy fire
<dt>Flushing the orient with their glowing tints,
<dt>Clothing the haggard plains in rich attire,
<dt>And flashing from great hills of naked flints,
<dt>Until the gaunt and hungry earth displayed
<dt>The jewelled splendour of a queen arrayed.
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>Dante to Beatrice</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Ah God, the gulf between us is too dark!
<dt>Too deep, and dark, and terrible to cross;
<dt>If either now should launch a venturing bark,
<dt>The surging breakers would assail, and toss
<dt>And rend it into pieces; it would fare
<dt>On these fell waters that between us scream
<dt>And fling fierce arms of hatred through the air,
<dt>Like some frail atom in a demon's dream;
<dt>Yea, it would perish and go down to doom
<dt>In ravenous swirls of chaos, like a dove
<dt>Caught in mid riot of the crash and boom
<dt>Of fire and rain and thunder. From above
<dt>There where thou livest in pure light divine
<dt>Smile and again this whole dark earth will shine.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>"Never again will she visit the Old Well"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O weary watcher waiting at the well!
<dt>She cannot come to fill thy aching brain
<dt>With thoughts as sweet as nectar in a cell,
<dt>Or bright as flowers in a dreamy dell;
<dt>Her individual force is spent; in vain
<dt>Thou yearnest for the touch that eases pain;
<dt>No longer can she weave her mystic spell.
<dt>For she is now a part of all around,
<dt>A spirit and an essence, a desire,
<dt>An inspiration in the heart of things,
<dt>That murmurs in the harmony of sound,
<dt>Is white in lilies, red in flaming fire,
<dt>And everlasting in recurring springs.
<p>
<a name=110></a><h2>The Law</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Yea, is it so? will death relieve the soul
<dt>Of its most secret and inveterate sin?
<dt>Will all be altered when behind the goal
<dt>Set to the flesh, the spirit shall pass in?
<dt>It cannot be; as we have lived we die;
<dt>Prone in the arms of our unrighteous deeds
<dt>At the last moment we shall surely lie
<dt>And so pass forth. Nothing there is but breeds
<dt>The thing it is; evil shall still be so,
<dt>Though spirit-borne into ethereal ways;
<dt>Yet there perchance a stronger will may grow,
<dt>To do some work which God may bless with praise
<dt>As being good; a new environment
<dt>Remoulds us till we lose the old intent.
