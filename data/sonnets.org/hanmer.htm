<a name=010></a><h2>The Steam-boat</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>White wings, that over the hyacinthine sea
<dt>With joy or hope or sorrow long have sped;
<dt>Since first he voyaged whom the Colchian wed;
<dt>Bearing lone ships over many a salt degree;
<dt>A voice came thence where ye were wont to be;
<dt>A strange and serpent utterance; high over head
<dt>Trailed its dark breath; and with Ixion's tread
<dt>A keel passed by, mocking the stormy lee.
<p>
<dt>Into the rack, far lessening, on it went,
<dt>As once that antique lover of the cloud:
<dt>While ye to veering winds were bowed and bent;
<dt>And ocean roared with his great voice aloud;
<dt>Lashing his waves gainst isle and continent,
<dt>Vexed with the wake that wheel-borne ship had ploughed.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Chaucer</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When I remember how, nor separate chance
<dt>Nor restless traffic peopling many a shore
<dt>Nor old tradition with innumerous lore,
<dt>But poets wrought our best inheritance;
<dt>Sweet words and noble; in their <i>gai science</i>
<dt>That England heard, and then for evermore
<dt>Loved as her own, and did with deeds adore;
<dt>I bless thee with a kindred heart, Provence;
<p>
<dt>For to thy tales, like waves that come and go,
<dt>Sat Chaucer listening with exulting ear;
<dt>And casting his own phrase in giant mould:
<dt>That still had charms for sorrow's gentlest tear,
<dt>Telling the story of Griselda's woe,
<dt>"Under the roots of Vesulus the cold."
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Spring</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Soft comes the breath of spring, it shakes the pear
<dt>White blooming; like a garden seems the mead
<dt>Thick with young grass, on which the cattle feed
<dt>Tossing their heads at their dull wintry fare.
<dt>The bees seek honey through the moving air
<dt>That rocks the wild-duck on her nest of reed,
<dt>By the sunlit water: Man doth say "God speed,"
<dt>For joy the year's increase so soon to share,
<dt>Low, to himself he says it; where, alas,
<dt>Are the old rites? a dullard race are we;
<dt>Clear shows of inner feeling fade and pass;
<dt>There are no pomps to greet <i>Eiarine</i>.
<dt>Our hearts reflect as a smoke-darkened glass,
<dt>When like a prison of crystal they should be.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Evening in Germany</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How each sharp hammer of the minster clock
<dt>Cuts off a point of time, until the bell,
<dt>Up-carolling to the clouds with silvery swell,
<dt>The sullen presage like a bird doth mock;
<dt>But the day fleets, and the shadow of the rock
<dt>Falls opposite to where at morn it fell;
<dt>The bees come home, each to her angular cell;
<dt>Up to his hostel flies the roosting cock.
<p>
<dt>Now creep the beggars, some with misery pined,
<dt>To dungeon-pits; some where the woodland yields
<dt>Small shelter, thinned for comfortable fires:
<dt>Some to lone huts such as the shepherd builds
<dt>Under a bank to shield him from the wind,
<dt>In an old tree set round with thorns and briars.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Melancholy</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There sat a maiden neath a regal tower
<dt>Girt with a forest of great oaks and pines,
<dt>It seemed a lodge of some high conqueror
<dt>In the old days, and round it creeping vines
<dt>Grew wildly, that no more men drank of now;
<dt>And in the topmost arch there was a bell
<dt>That with the wind did vibrate; vague and low
<dt>Sped over the hills its modulated swell;
<dt>Palely she sat, and at her side were things
<dt>Of strange device to measure earth and stars,
<dt>And a small quiet genius with his wings
<dt>Upfolded and his eyes still fixed on hers,
<dt>Men uttered not her queenly name, but she
<dt>Had graved it in the dust, <i>Melancoly</i>.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>A Winter Scene</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dd>"Chacun pourtant conservera
<dd>son culte" (de Beranger)
<p>
<dt>It is the winter, sharp and suddenly
<dt>His angel frost hath breathed upon the land:
<dt>Tartuffe now at the chancel door doth stand
<dt>Dispensing loaves from others' charity,
<dt>And round about him come a hungry band
<dt>With piteous voice and asking eyes, but he
<dt>A little backward sheltered from the wind,
<dt>A book turns over, for the Church must be
<dt>Maintained, and therein all who are behind
<dt>With Easter dues are writ; it is poverty
<dt>Moves them, but duty stern his reverence;
<dt>The loaves were given the Church, with pious mind,
<dt>And justly they by wanting must be fined,
<dt>Although it grieves him, till they pay their pence.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>A View in Holland</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The tide comes up the black and gusty river,
<dt>Slowly against it makes a boat its way,
<dt>In the rough gale the bending sedges shiver,
<dt>The dripping piles fling back the shattered spray;
<dt>There is a church, but none who come to pray--
<dt>For it is a week-day and made fast the door,
<dt>But onward by a willow-sheltered bay
<dt>Hangs forth a sign more tempting to the boer;
<p>
<dt>Wild sing the breezes from the northern sea
<dt>Flustering the topsails on the coast's low line,
<dt>Windly sings Hans within the lattice, he
<dt>Is flustered too, but it is with <i>brantewein</i>:
<dt>See on the sands a wandering group appear,
<dt>Mynherr Verkoop the pedlar and his gear.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>Terracina</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The black waves come in lashing the old walls,
<dt>The shipless harbour from the shipless sea;
<dt>The dreary wind sinks down at intervals--
<dt>Winter is here, and yet it spring should be,
<dt>Chasing the snows with sweet regality,
<dt>And the wild hills enamelling with flowers,
<dt>That now the myrtle sore and pallidly
<dt>Turning its branches from the salt spray-showers
<dt>Reigns over alone on yon deserted towers
<dt>An aloe grows, but its tall bloom is dead,
<dt>Deep in his chink the bright green lizard cowers,
<dt>Sunshiny elf, and fears the stranger's tread
<dt>Rolling the loose stones down the steep, but he
<dt>Loves thee, quaint creature, and thy watchful head.
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>Winter</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>To the short days, and the great vault of shade
<dt>The whitener of the hills, we come--alas,
<dt>There is no colour in the faded grass,
<dt>Save the thick frost on its hoar stems arrayed.
<dt>Cold is it: as a melancholy maid,
<dt>The latest of the seasons now doth pass,
<dt>With a dead garland, in her icy glass
<dt>Setting its spikes about her crisp&eacute;d braid.
<dt>The streams shall breathe, along the orchards laid,
<dt>In the soft spring-time; and the frozen mass
<dt>Melt from the snow-drift; flowerets where it was
<dt>Shoot up--the cuckoo shall delight the glade;
<dt>But to new glooms through some obscure crevasse
<dt>She will have past--that melancholy maid.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>England</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Arise up, England, from the smoky cloud
<dt>That covers thee, the din of whirling wheels:
<dt>Not the pale spinner, prematurely bowed
<dt>By his hot toil, alone the influence feels
<dt>Of all this deep necessity for gain:
<dt>Gain still; but deem not only by the strain
<dt>Of engines on the sea and on the shore,
<dt>Glory, that was thy birthright, to retain.
<dt>O thou that knewest not a conqueror,
<dt>Unchecked desires have multiplied in thee,
<dt>Till with their bat-wings they shut out the sun:
<dt>So in the dusk thou goest moodily,
<dt>With a bent head, as one who gropes for ore,
<dt>Heedless of living streams that round him run.
<p>
<a name=110></a><h2>To the Fountain at Frascati</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Not by Aldobrandini's watery show,
<dt>Still plashing at his portal never dumb
<dt>Minished of my devotion, shalt thou come,
<dt>Leaving thy natural fount on Algido,
<dt>Wild wing&egrave;d daughter of the Sabine snow;
<dt>Now creeping under quiet Tusculum;
<dt>Now gushing from those caverns old and numb;--
<dt>Dull were his heart who gazed upon thee so.
<dt>Emblem thou art of Time, memorial stream,
<dt>Which in ten thousand fancies, being here,
<dt>We waste, or use, or fashion, as we deem;
<dt>But if its backward voice comes ever near,
<dt>As thine upon the hill, how doth it seem
<dt>Solemn and stern, sepulchral and severe!
