<a name=001></a><h2>"Happy ye leaves! whenas those lily hands"</h2>
<P>
<dt>Happy ye leaves! whenas those lily hands,
<dt>Which hold my life in their dead doing might,
<dt>Shall handle you, and hold in love's soft bands,
<dt>Like captives trembling at the victor's sight.
<dt>And happy lines! on which, with starry light,
<dt>Those lamping eyes will deign sometimes to look,
<dt>And read the sorrows of my dying sprite,
<dt>Written with tears in heart's close bleeding book.
<dt>And happy rhymes! bathed in the sacred brook
<dt>Of Helicon, whence she derived is,
<dt>When ye behold that angel's blessed look,
<dt>My soul's long lacked food, my heaven's bliss.
<dt>Leaves, lines, and rhymes seek her to please alone,
<dt>Whom if ye please, I care for other none.
<P>
<a name=102></a><H2>"Most glorious Lord of life, that on this day"</H2>
<P>
<dt>Most glorious Lord of life, that on this day
<dt>Didst make thy triumph over death and sin,
<dt>And having harrowed hell, didst bring away
<dt>Captivity thence captive, us to win:
<dt>This joyous day, dear Lord, with joy begin,
<dt>And grant that we, for whom thou diddest die,
<dt>Being with thy dear blood clean washed from sin,
<dt>May live forever in felicity:
<dt>And that thy love we weighing worthily,
<dt>May likewise love thee for the same again;
<dt>And for thy sake, that all like dear didst buy,
<dt>May love with one another entertain.
<dt>So let us love, dear love, like as we ought, 
<dt>Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.
<P>
<a name=075></a><H2>"One day I wrote her name upon the strand"</H2>
<P>
<dt>One day I wrote her name upon the strand,
<dt>But came the waves and washed it away:
<dt>Again I wrote it with a second hand,
<dt>But came the tide, and made my pains his prey.
<dt>Vain man, said she, that dost in vain assay
<dt>A mortal thing so to immortalize!
<dt>For I myself shall like to this decay,
<dt>And eek my name be wiped out likewise.
<dt>Not so (quoth I), let baser things devise
<dt>To die in dust, but you shall live by fame:
<dt>My verse your virtues rare shall eternize,
<dt>And in the heavens write your glorious name;
<dt>Where, whenas death shall all the world subdue,
<dt>Our love shall live, and later life renew.
<P>
<a name=104></a><H2>"Fair is my love, when her fair golden hairs"</H2>
<P>
<dt>Fair is my love, when her fair golden hairs
<dt>With the loose wind ye waving chance to mark:
<dt>Fair, when the rose in her red cheeks appears,
<dt>Or in her eyes the fire of love does spark:
<dt>Fair, when her breast, like a rich laden bark
<dt>With precious merchandise she forth doth lay:
<dt>Fair, when that cloud of pride, which oft doth dark
<dt>Her goodly light, with smiles she drives away
<dt>But fairest she, when so she doth display
<dt>The gate with pearls and rubies richly dight,
<dt>Through which her words so wise do make their way,
<dt>To bear the message of her gentle sprite.
<dt>The rest be works of nature's wonderment,
<dt>But this the work of heart's astonishment.
