<p>
<dt>I, from whose heart young Love is long time gone
<dt>Beyond recall,--and in his secret place
<dt>Dull Sorrow soothes with sad, averted face
<dt>Her restless sister Pain with visage wan,
<dt>Handmaidens of the shadow-footed One
<dt>Who comes more slowly than the season's pace
<dt>Creeping around the year,--I wish you grace,
<dt>As you stand glorious in life's morning sun.
<p>
<dt>Your blood-red lips are eager at the brim
<dt>Of that deep cup, now amply poured for you.
<dt>Drink with closed eyes, nor look upon the lees
<dt>They only quaff whose joys are memories.
<dt>Drink of the bubbles sparkling at the rim,
<dt>The dregs are bitter, and your hours are few.
