<p>
<dt>Sonnets are full of love, and this my tome
<dt>Has many sonnets: so here now shall be
<dt>One sonnet more, a love sonnet, from me
<dt>To her whose heart is my heart's quiet home,
<dt>To my first Love, my Mother, on whose knee
<dt>I learnt love-lore that is not troublesome;
<dt>Whose service is my special dignity,
<dt>And she my loadstar while I go and come
<dt>And so because you love me, and because
<dt>I love you, Mother, I have woven a wreath
<dt>Of rhymes wherewith to crown your honored name:
<dt>In you not fourscore years can dim the flame
<dt>Of love, whose blessed glow transcends the laws
<dt>Of time and change and mortal life and death.
</p>
<p>
<a name=150></a><h2>Remember</h2> (<a href="remember.ram"><i>audio</i></a>)
<p>
<dt>Remember me when I am gone away,
<dt>Gone far away into the silent land;
<dt>When you can no more hold me by the hand,
<dt>Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
<dt>Remember me when no more, day by day,
<dt>You tell me of our future that you plann'd:
<dt>Only remember me; you understand
<dt>It will be late to counsel then or pray.
<dt>Yet if you should forget me for a while
<dt>And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
<dt>For if the darkness and corruption leave
<dt>A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
<dt>Better by far you should forget and smile
<dt>Than that you should remember and be sad.

BEATRICE, immortalized by "altissimo poeta. . . cotanto amante;" Laura, celebrated by a great though an inferior bard,--have alike paid the exceptional penalty of exceptional honor, and have come down to us resplendent with charms, but (at least, to my apprehension) scant of attractiveness.

<p>These heroines of world-wide fame were preceded by a bevy of unnamed ladies "donne innominate" sung by a school of less conspicuous poets; and in that land and that period which gave simultaneous birth to Catholics, to Albigenses, and to Troubadours, one can imagine many a lady as sharing her lover's poetic aptitude, while the barrier between them might be one held sacred by both, yet not such as to render mutual love incompatible with mutual honor.

<p>Had such a lady spoken for herself, the portrait left us might have appeared more tender, if less dignified, than any drawn even by a devoted friend.  Or had the Great Poetess of our own day and nation only been unhappy instead of happy, her circumstances would have invited her to bequeath to us, in lieu of the "Portuguese Sonnets," an inimitable "donna innominata" drawn not from fancy but from feeling, and worthy to occupy a niche beside Beatrice and Laura.
