<dt>Weav'd in my low devout melancholy,
<dt>Thou which of good, hast, yea art treasury,
<dt>All changing unchanged Ancient of days,
<dt>But do not, with a vile crown of frail <a href="#999">bays</a>,
<dt>Reward my muse's white sincerity,
<dt>But what thy thorny crown gained, that give me,
<dt>A crown of Glory, which doth flower always;
<dt>The ends crown our works, but thou crown'st our ends,
<dt>For at our end begins our endlesse rest,
<dt>The first last end, now zealously possest,
<dt>With a strong sober thirst, my soul attends.
<dt>'Tis time that heart and voice be lifted high,
<dt><i>Salvation to all that will is nigh.</i>

<P>
<dt><i>Salvation to all that will is nigh,</i>
<dt>That All, which always is All everywhere,
<dt>Which cannot sin, and yet all sins must bear,
<dt>Which cannot die, yet cannot choose but die,
<dt>Loe, faithful Virgin, yields himself to lie
<dt>In prison, in thy womb; and though he there
<dt>Can take no sin, nor thou give, yet he'will wear
<dt>Taken from thence, flesh, which death's force may try.
<dt>Ere by the spheres time was created, thou
<dt>Wast in his mind, who is thy Son, and Brother,
<dt>Whom thou conceiv'st, conceiv'd; yea thou art now
<dt>Thy maker's maker, and thy Father's mother,
<dt>Thou hast light in dark; and shutst in little room,
<dt><i>Immensity cloistered in thy dear womb.</i>

<P>
<dt><i>Immensity cloistered in thy dear womb,</i>
<dt>Now leaves his welbelov'd imprisonment,
<dt>There he hath made himself to his intent
<dt>Weak enough, now into our world to come;
<dt>But Oh, for thee, for him, hath th'Inne no roome?
<dt>Yet lay him in this stall, and from the Orient,
<dt>Stars, and wisemen will travel to prevent
<dt>Th'effect of Herod's jealous general doom;
<dt>Seest thou, my Soul, with thy faith's eyes, how he
<dt>Which fills all place, yet none holds him, doth lie?
<dt>Was not his pity towards thee wondrous high,
<dt>That would have need to be pitied by thee?
<dt>Kiss him, and with him into Egypt goe,
<dt><i>With his kind mother, who partakes thy woe.</i>

<dt><i>With his kind mother, who partakes thy woe,</i>
<dt>Joseph turn back; see where your child doth sit,
<dt>Blowing, yea blowing out those sparks of wit,
<dt>Which himself on the Doctors did bestow;
<dt>The Word but lately could not speake, and loe
<dt>It suddenly speaks wonders, whence comes it,
<dt>That all which was, and all which should be writ,
<dt>A shallow seeming child, should deeply know?
<dt>His Godhead was not soul to his manhood,
<dt>Nor had time mellow'd him to this ripenesse,
<dt>But as for one which hath a long task, 'tis good,
<dt>With the Sunne to begin his businesse,
<dt>He in His age's morning thus began
<dt><i>By miracles exceeding power of man.</i>
</P>

<dt>In both affections many to him ran,
<dt>But Oh! the worst are most, they will and can,
<dt>Alas, and do, unto the immaculate,
<dt>Whose creature Fate is, now prescribe a Fate,
<dt>Measuring selfe-life's infinity to a span,
<dt>Nay to an inch. Loe, where condemned he
<dt>Bears his own cross, with pain, yet by and by
<dt>When it bears him, he must bear more and die;
<dt>Now thou art lifted up, draw me to thee,
<dt>And at thy death giving such liberal dole,
<dt><i>Moist, with one drop of thy blood, my dry soule.</i>

<P>
<dt><i>Moist, with one drop of thy blood, my dry soule</i>
<dt>Shall (though she now be in extreme degree
<dt>Too stony hard, and yet too fleshly) be
<dt>Freed by that drop, from being starved, hard, or foul,
<dt>And life, by this death abled, shall control
<dt>Death, whom thy death slew; nor shall to me
<dt>Fear of first or last death, bring misery,
<dt>If in thy little book my name thou enroll,
<dt>Flesh in that long sleep is not putrified,
<dt>But made that there, of which, and for which 'twas;
<dt>Nor can by other means be glorified.
<dt>May then sins sleep, and deaths soon from me pass,
<dt>That waked from both, I again risen may
<dt><i>Salute the last, and everlasting day.</i>

<dt>Joy at the uprising of this Sunne, and Sonne,
<dt>Ye whose just tears, or tribulation
<dt>Have purely washed, or burnt your drossy clay;
<dt>Behold the Highest, parting hence away,
<dt>Lightens the dark clouds, which he treads upon,
<dt>Nor doth he by ascending, show alone,
<dt>But first he, and he first enters the way.
<dt>O strong Ram which hast battered heaven for me,
<dt>Mild lamb, which with thy blood, hast marked the path;
<dt>Bright Torch, which shin'st, that I the way may see,
<dt>Oh, with thy own blood quench thy own just wrath.
<dt>And if the holy Spirit, my Muse did raise,
<dt><i>Deign at my hands this crown of prayer and praise.</i>

<P>
<dt>Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?
<dt>Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste,
<dt>I run to death, and death meets me as fast,
<dt>And all my pleasures are like yesterday;
<dt>I dare not move my dim eyes any way,
<dt>Despair behind, and death before doth cast
<dt>Such terror, and my feeble flesh doth waste
<dt>By sin in it, which it t'wards hell doth weigh;
<dt>Only thou art above, and when towards thee
<dt>By thy leave I can look, I rise again;
<dt>But our old subtle foe so tempteth me,
<dt>That not one hour my self I can sustain;
<dt>Thy Grace may wing me to prevent his art,
<dt>And thou like Adamant draw mine iron heart.

<P>
<dt>As due by many t&#105;tles I resign
<dt>My self to Thee, O God; first I was made
<dt>By Thee, and for Thee, and when I was decayed
<dt>Thy blood bought that, the which before was Thine;
<dt>I am Thy son, made with Thy Self to shine,
<dt>Thy servant, whose pains Thou hast still repaid,
<dt>Thy sheep, thine image, and, till I betrayed
<dt>My self, a temple of Thy Spirit divine;
<dt>Why doth the devil then usurp on me?
<dt>Why doth he steal, nay ravish that's thy right?
<dt>Except thou rise and for thine own work fight,
<dt>Oh I shall soon despair, when I do see
<dt>That thou lov'st mankind well, yet wilt not choose me,
<dt>And Satan hates me, yet is loth to lose me.
</P>
<a name=103></a><h2>"O might those sighs and tears return again"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>O might those sighs and tears return again
<dt>Into my breast and eyes, which I have spent,
<dt>That I might in this holy discontent
<dt>Mourn with some fruit, as I have mourned in vain;
<dt>In mine Idolatry what showers of rain
<dt>Mine eyes did waste! what griefs my heart did rent!
<dt>That sufferance was my sin; now I repent;
<dt>'Cause I did suffer I must suffer pain.
<dt>Th' hydropic drunkard, and night-scouting thief,
<dt>The itchy lecher, and self-tickling proud
<dt>Have the remembrance of past joys for relief
<dt>Of comming ills. To (poor) me is allowed
<dt>No ease; for long, yet vehement grief hath been
<dt>Th' effect and cause, the punishment and sin.
</P>
<a name=104></a><h2>"Oh my black soul! now art thou summoned"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Oh my black soul! now art thou summoned
<dt>By sickness, death's herald, and champion;
<dt>Thou art like a pilgrim, which abroad hath done
<dt>Treason, and durst not turn to whence he is fled;
<dt>Or like a thief, which till death's doom be read,
<dt>Wisheth himself delivered from prison,
<dt>But damned and haled to execution,
<dt>Wisheth that still he might be imprisoned.
<dt>Yet grace, if thou repent, thou canst not lack;
<dt>But who shall give thee that grace to begin?
<dt>Oh make thy self with holy mourning black,
<dt>And red with blushing, as thou art with sin;
<dt>Or wash thee in Christ's blood, which hath this might
<dt>That being red, it dyes red souls to white.
</P>

<P>
<dt>At the round earth's imagined corners, blow
<dt>Your trumpets, Angels, and arise, arise
<dt>From death, you numberless infinities
<dt>Of souls, and to your scattered bodies go,
<dt>All whom the flood did, and fire shall o'erthrow,
<dt>All whom war, dearth, age, agues, tyrannies,
<dt>Despair, law, chance, hath slain, and you whose eyes,
<dt>Shall behold God, and never taste death's woe.
<dt>But let them sleep, Lord, and me mourn a space,
<dt>For, if above all these, my sins abound,
<dt>'Tis late to ask abundance of thy grace,
<dt>When we are there; here on this lowly ground,
<dt>Teach me how to repent; for that's as good
<dt>As if thou hadst seal'd my pardon, with thy blood.
</P>

<P>
<dt>If faithful souls be alike glorified
<dt>As angels, then my father's soul doth see,
<dt>And adds this even to full felicity,
<dt>That valiantly I hell's wide mouth o'erstride:
<dt>But if our minds to these souls be descried
<dt>By circumstances, and by signs that be
<dt>Apparent in us, not immediately,
<dt>How shall my mind's white truth by them be tried?
<dt>They see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn,
<dt>And vile blasphemous conjurers to call
<dt>On Jesus name, and Pharisaical
<dt>Dissemblers feigne devotion. Then turn,
<dt>O pensive soul, to God, for he knows best
<dt>Thy true grief, for he put it in my breast.
</P>
<a name=110></a><h2>"Death be not proud, though some have called thee"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Death be not proud, though some have called thee
<dt>Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so,
<dt>For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow,
<dt>Die not, poor death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
<dt>From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,
<dt>Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow,
<dt>And soonest our best men with thee do go,
<dt>Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery.
<dt>Thou art slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men,
<dt>And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,
<dt>And poppy, or charms can make us sleep as well,
<dt>And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?
<dt>One short sleep past, we wake eternally,
<dt>And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die.

<P>
<dt>Spit in my face you Jews, and pierce my side,
<dt>Buffet, and scoff, scourge, and crucify me,
<dt>For I have sinned, and sinned, and only he
<dt>Who could do no iniquity hath died:
<dt>But by my death can not be satisfied
<dt>My sins, which pass the Jews' impiety:
<dt>They killed once an inglorious man, but I
<dt>Crucify him daily, being now glorified.
<dt>Oh let me, then, his strange love still admire:
<dt>Kings pardon, but he bore our punishment.
<dt>And Jacob came clothed in vile harsh attire
<dt>But to supplant, and with gainful intent:
<dt>God clothed himself in vile man's flesh, that so
<dt>He might be weak enough to suffer woe.

<P>
<dt>Why are we by all creatures waited on?
<dt>Why do the prodigal elements supply
<dt>Life and food to me, being more pure than I,
<dt>Simple, and further from corruption?
<dt>Why brook'st thou, ignorant horse, subjection?
<dt>Why dost thou, bull, and bore so seelily,
<dt>Dissemble weakness, and by one man's stroke die,
<dt>Whose whole kind you might swallow and feed upon?
<dt>Weaker I am, woe is me, and worse than you,
<dt>You have not sinned, nor need be timorous.
<dt>But wonder at a greater wonder, for to us
<dt>Created nature doth these things subdue,
<dt>But their Creator, whom sin nor nature tied,
<dt>For us, His creatures, and His foes, hath died.

<P>
<dt>What if this present were the world's last night?
<dt>Mark in my heart, O soul, where thou dost dwell,
<dt>The picture of Christ crucified, and tell
<dt>Whether that countenance can thee affright,
<dt>Tears in his eyes quench the amazing light,
<dt>Blood fills his frowns, which from his pierced head fell.
<dt>And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell,
<dt>Which prayed forgiveness for his foes' fierce spite?
<dt>No, no; but as in my idolatry
<dt>I said to all my profane mistresses,
<dt>Beauty, of pity, foulness only is
<dt>A sign of rigour: so I say to thee,
<dt>To wicked spirits are horrid shapes assigned,
<dt>This beauteous form assures a piteous mind.
</P>
<a name=114></a><h2>"Batter my heart, three-person'd God..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Batter my heart, three-person'd God; for you
<dt>As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;
<dt>That I may rise, and stand, o'erthrow me and bend
<dt>Your force, to break, blow, burn and make me new.
<dt>I, like an usurpt town, to another due,
<dt>Labour to admit you, but Oh, to no end,
<dt>Reason your viceroy in me, me should defend,
<dt>But is captiv'd, and proves weak or untrue.
<dt>Yet dearly I love you, and would be loved fain,
<dt>But am betroth'd unto your enemy:
<dt>Divorce me, untie, or break that knot again,
<dt>Take me to you, imprison me, for I
<dt>Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,
<dt>Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.

<P>
<dt>Wilt thou love God, as he thee? Then digest,
<dt>My soul, this wholesome meditation,
<dt>How God the Spirit, by angels waited on
<dt>In heaven, doth make his Temple in thy breast.
<dt>The Father having begot a Son most blest,
<dt>And still begetting, (for he ne'er be gone)
<dt>Hath deigned to choose thee by adoption,
<dt>Co-heir t' his glory, and Sabbath' endless rest.
<dt>And as a robbed man, which by search doth find
<dt>His stol'n stuff sold, must lose or buy 't again:
<dt>The Son of glory came down, and was slain,
<dt>Us whom he'd made, and Satan stol'n, to unbind.
<dt>'Twas much that man was made like God before,
<dt>But, that God should be made like man, much more.

<P>
<dt>Father, part of his double interest
<dt>Unto thy kingdom, thy Son gives to me,
<dt>His jointure in the knotty Trinity
<dt>He keeps, and gives to me his death's conquest.
<dt>This Lamb, whose death with life the world hath blest,
<dt>Was from the world's beginning slain, and he
<dt>Hath made two Wills which with the Legacy
<dt>Of his and thy kingdom do thy Sons invest.
<dt>Yet such are thy laws that men argue yet
<dt>Whether a man those statutes can fulfil;
<dt>None doth; but all-healing grace and spirit
<dt>Revive again what law and letter kill.
<dt>Thy law's abridgement, and thy last command
<dt>Is all but love; Oh let this last Will stand!

<P>
<dt>Oh, to vex me, contraries meet in one:
<dt>Inconstancy unnaturally hath begot
<dt>A constant habit; that when I would not
<dt>I change in vows, and in devotion.
<dt>As humorous is my contrition
<dt>As my profane love, and as soon forgot:
<dt>As riddlingly distempered, cold and hot,
<dt>As praying, as mute; as infinite, as none.
<dt>I durst not view heaven yesterday; and today
<dt>In prayers and flattering speeches I court God:
<dt>Tomorrow I quake with true fear of his rod.
<dt>So my devout fits come and go away
<dt>Like a fantastic ague; save that here
<dt>Those are my best days, when I shake with fear.
