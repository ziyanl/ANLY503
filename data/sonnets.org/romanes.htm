<dt>When I look back upon my childish years,
<dt>And think how little then I thought at all,
<dt>Sometimes to me it now almost appears,
<dt>So great the change has been, 'twere but a small
<dt>Increase of change that might transform a man
<dt>Into a spirit, standing at the throne
<dt>Of God, to see in full the mighty plan
<dt>Divine, and know as also he is known.
<dt>For why should thus so vast a growth have been,
<dt>Which all but tops the verge of earthly skies,
<dt>If, at the end, all that a man hath seen
<dt>Be blotted out before his closing eyes?
<dt>So were it better still a child to be,
<dt>And shout young laughter through a world of glee.

<p>
<dt>Why should I chafe and fret myself to find
<dt>Some pebble still untouched upon the beach,
<dt>Where struggling wavelets follow each on each
<dt>Upon the tide-mark of advancing Mind?
<dt>If, one with them and urged by those behind,
<dt>My utmost energy at last should reach
<dt>A stone unwetted by a bubble's breach,
<dt>What gain were it to me or to my kind?
<p>
<dt>Though I should fail that further inch to go,
<dt>Some other soon will creep its rugged floor,
<dt>While, resting on the conquered strand below,
<dt>I calmly watch the rivalry before,
<dt>Rejoicing at the steady onward flow,
<dt>But at my new-found peace rejoicing more.
