<a name=010></a><h2>A Dream of Blue Eyes</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I left thee when the midnight bell had tolled,
<dt>Full of fresh hopes and feelings: in thine eyes
<dt>All night perpetual meanings did unfold
<dt>Quick turns of thought and kindling sympathies,
<dt>Still those blue eyes looked at me through my sleep,
<dt>Changed by the power of dreams to fearful things.
<dt>They bore me far away, where evening flings
<dt>Her gorgeous blue on Atlas: they did sweep
<dt>Into the bluer sky, where comets blaze
<dt>And golden creatures live in starry rays.
<dt>Onward they went where filmy mist-wreaths creep
<dt>About the rolling moon; and fell with me
<dt>Into the sunless caverns of the sea,
<dt>Where spirits all of blue into my soul did gaze!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The After-state</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A spirit came upon me in the night
<dt>And led me gently down a rocky stair
<dt>Unto a peopled garden, green and fair,
<dt>Where all the day there was an evening light.
<dt>Trees out of every nation blended there.
<dt>The citron shrub its golden fruit did train
<dt>Against an English elm: it was like a dream
<dt>Because there was no wind; and things did seem
<dt>All near and big, like mountains before rain,
<dt>Far in those twilight bowers beside a stream
<dt>The soul of one who had but lately died
<dt>Hung listening, with a brother at his side;
<dt>And no one spoke in all that haunted place
<dt>But looked quietly into each other's face.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Rothay</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Come now and see yon orient vale outspread,
<dt>And mark the windings of my favourite rill;
<dt>For the wan olive-lights are on the hill,
<dt>Dear autumn's choicest boon; and there is shed
<dt>A most surpassing glory on the stream,
<dt>Kindled just now by evening's purple gleam.
<dt>Yon lake with shady islands gave it birth,
<dt>To it yon English village doth belong,
<dt>And many a night the joyousness and mirth
<dt>Of its dear flow hath been my vesper song.
<dt>See how it peeps in meadows fringed with flowers,
<dt>Or nestles jealously mid leafy bowers,
<dt>As if it almost felt, and shunned to show
<dt>The gracefulness that makes men love it so.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Keswick, August 3, 1838</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Some fall in love with voices, some with eyes,
<dt>Some men are linked together by a tear;
<dt>Others by smiles; many who cannot tell
<dt>What time the angel passed who left the spell.
<dt>It comes to us among the winds that rise
<dt>Scattering their gifts on all things far and near.
<dt>The fields of unripe corn, the mountain lake,
<dt>And the great-hearted sea--all things do take
<dt>Their glory and their witchery from winds:
<dt>All save the few black pools the woodman finds
<dt>Far in the depths of some unsunny place,
<dt>Which stand, albeit the happy winds are out
<dt>In all the tossing branches round about,
<dt>As silent and as fearful as a dead man's face.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Old-fashioned Houses, for a Lady Fond of Old Furniture</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sweet are old courts with dates above the doors,
<dt>And yew-trees clipped in shapes, and cedar walks,
<dt>And lawns whereon a quiet peacock stalks,
<dt>And leaden casements, and black shining floors,
<dt>And arm-chairs carved like good cathedral stalls,
<dt>And huge French clocks, and bedsteads most inviting,
<dt>And stiff old ladies hung upon the walls,
<dt>Famed in the days of English memoir-writing:--
<dt>Places whose very look kind thoughts might draw
<dt>Even to Anne Stuart or William of Nassau.
<dt>Sweeter than Tudor-stricken shrines are they,
<dt>With pleasant grounds and rivers lingering by,--
<dt>Quaint homes, that shed a pure, domestic ray
<dt>Over the dull time of English history.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Aged Cities</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I have known cities with the strong-armed Rhine
<dt>Clasping their mouldered quays in lordly sweep;
<dt>And lingered where the Maine's low waters shine
<dt>Through Tyrian Frankfort; and been fain to weep
<dt>Mid the green cliffs where pale Mosella laves
<dt>That Roman sepulchre, imperial Tr&egrave;ves.
<dt>Ghent boasts her steet, and Bruges her moonlight square;
<dt>And holy Mechlin, Rome of Flanders, stands
<dt>Like a queen-mother on her spacious lands;
<dt>And Antwerp shoots her glowing spire in air.
<dt>Yet have I seen no place, by inland brook,
<dt>Hill-top, or plain, or trim arcaded bowers,
<dt>That carries age so nobly in its look
<dt>As Oxford with the sun upon her towers.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>Sonnet-writing: To Himself</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Young men should not write sonnets, if they dream
<dt>Some day to reach the bright bare seats of fame:
<dt>To such, sweet thoughts and mighty feelings seem
<dt>As though, like foreign things, they rarely came.
<dt>Eager as men when haply they have heard
<dt>Of some new songster, some gay-feathered bird,
<dt>That hath over blue seas strayed in hope to find
<dt>In our thin foliage here a summer home
<dt>Fain would they catch the bright things in their mind,
<dt>And cage them into sonnets as they come.
<dt>No; they should serve their wants most sparingly,
<dt>Till the ripe time of song, when young thoughts fail,
<dt>Then their sad sonnets, like old bards, might be
<dt>Merry as youth, and yet grey-haired and hale.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>Favourite Books</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Here, in thy choice old city, do I dwell
<dt>At thy dread feet, most honoured Clarendon!
<dt>Catching the precious words, that one by one
<dt>Fall from thy lips; because I love full well
<dt>Thy good and stately sadness: and I prize,
<dt>As warnings for this land, the auguries
<dt>Wherewith like fatal seeds thy pages swell.
<dt>From these hot thoughts and tears too oft I fly
<dt>To the gay Froissart and those wondrous men
<dt>Who dreamed of honour and had heart to die
<dt>For their own brave and glorious dream; and then,
<dt>Albeit with boyish lingerings, again
<dt>I turn to graver books where by my side
<dt>Lies Origen, my dear and perilous guide.
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>The Menai Bridge</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Fairest of rocky England's channel-gates!
<dt>With what a blessed calm to the main ocean
<dt>The ebbing tide with silent under-motion
<dt>Upward is drawn along thy weedy Straits!
<dt>The glossy water, shot with blue and green,
<dt>Throws off the sunlight like the restless throat
<dt>Of some vain dove; and ships, methinks, might float,
<dt>Trusting the deep in places so serene.
<dt>Thus wreathed in folds of summer billow, who
<dt>Would deem old tales of wreck and tempest true,
<dt>Where yon vast marvel, like an albatross
<dt>Still springing upward, as it seems, in air,
<dt>Spreads in light grandeur his huge wings across,
<dt>Self-poised in momentary balance there?
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>The Four Religious Heathens</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name=110></a><h3>Herodotus</h3>
<h4>"Converse in fear, during the time of your sojourning here."</h4>
<p>
<dt>He was a mild old man, and cherished much
<dt>The weight dark Egypt on his spirit laid;
<dt>And with a sinuous eloquence would touch
<dt>For ever at that haven of the dead.
<dt>Single romantic words by him were thrown,
<dt>As types, on men and places, with a power
<dt>Like that of shifting sunlight after shower
<dt>Kindling the cones of hills and journeying on.
<dt>He feared the gods and heroes, and spake low,
<dt>That Echo might not hear in her light room:
<dt>He was a dweller underground; for gloom
<dt>Fitted old heathen goodness more than glow;
<dt>And, where love was not, faith might gather mirth
<dt>From ore that glistened in pale beds of earth.
<p>
<a name=120></a><h3>Nicias</h3>
<h4>"In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish things against God."</h4>
<p>
<dt>Nursling of heathen fear! thy woful being,
<dt>Was steeped in gentleness by long disease,
<dt>Though round thine awestruck mind were ever fleeing
<dt>Omens, and signs, and direful presages.
<dt>One might believe in frames so gently stern
<dt>Some Christian thoughts before their time did burn.
<dt>Sadness was unto thee for love; thy spirit
<dt>Rose loftily like some hard-featured stone,
<dt>Which summer sunbeam never makes its throne,
<dt>E'en while it fills the skirts of vapour near it.
<dt>One wert thou, Nicias! of the few who urge
<dt>Their stricken souls where far-seen Death doth hover
<dt>In vision on them, nor may they diverge
<dt>From the black line his chilling shadows cover.
<p>
<a name=130></a><h3>Socrates</h3>
<h4>"Of making many books there is no end; and much study is an affliction of the flesh."</h4>
<p>
<dt>Thou, mighty Heathen, wert not so bereft
<dt>Of heavenly helps to thy great-hearted deeds,
<dt>That thou shouldst dig for truths in broken creeds,
<dt>'Mid the loose sands of four old empires left.
<dt>Motions and shadows dimly glowing fell
<dt>On thy broad soul from forms invisible.
<dt>With its plain grandeur, simple, calm, and free,
<dt>What wonder was it that thy life should merit
<dt>Sparkles of grace, and angel ministry,
<dt>With jealous glimpses of the world of spirit?
<dt>Greatest and best in this--that thy pure mind,
<dt>Upon its saving mission all intent,
<dt>Scorned the untruth of leaving books behind,
<dt>To claim for thine what through thy lips was sent.
<p>
<a name=140></a><h3>Seneca</h3>
<h4>"When Peter came, his shadow at the least might overshadow any of them."</h4>
<p>
<dt>Oft in the crowd and crossings of old Rome
<dt>The Christ-like shadow of the gifted Paul,
<dt>As he looked forth betimes from his hired home,
<dt>Might at this Gentile's hurrying footsteps fall,
<dt>When, from his mournings in the Caesar's hall,
<dt>Spurred by great thoughts, the troubled sage might come.
<dt>Some balmy truths most surely did he borrow
<dt>From the sweet neighbourhood of Christ, to bring
<dt>The harsh, hard waters of his heathen spring
<dt>In softening ducts o'er wastes of pagan sorrow.
<dt>As slips of green from fertile confines shoot
<dt>Into the tracts of sand, so heathen duty
<dt>Caught from his guided pen a cold, bright beauty,
<dt>Where flowers might all but blossom into fruit.
