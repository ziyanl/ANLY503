<P>
I had thought, courteous and gentle reader, not to have troubled thy patience
with these lines; but that, in the neglect thereof, I should either scorn
thee, as careless of thine opinion, a thing savoring of a proud humor; or
despair to obtain thy favor, which I am loath to conceive of thy good nature.
<P>
If I were known, I would entreat in the best manner; and speak for him whom
thou knewest. But being not known, thou speakest not against me; and therefore
I much care not. For this kind of poetry wherein I wrote, I did it only to
try my humor. And for the matter of love, it may be I am so devoted to some
one into whose hands these may light by chance that she may say (which thou
now sayest) that surely he is in love; which if she do, then have I the full
recompense of my labor, and the poems have dealt sufficiently for the discharge
of their own duty.
<P>
If thou muse what my Licia is: take her to be some Diana, at the least chaste;
or some Minerva; no Venus--fairer far. It may be she is learning's image,
or some heavenly wonder, which the precisest may not mislike. Perhaps under
that name I have shadowed Discipline. It may be I mean that kind courtesy
which I found at the patroness of these poems; it may be some college. It
may be my conceit, and portend nothing...

Bright matchless star, the honour of the sky,
<dt>
From whose clear shine heaven's vault hath all his light,
<dt>
I send these poems to your graceful eye;
<dt>
Do you but take them, and they have their right.
<dt>
I build besides a temple to your name,
<dt>
Wherein my thoughts shall daily sing your praise;
<dt>
And will erect an altar for the same,
<dt>
Which shall your virtues and your honour raise.
<dt>
But heaven the temple of your honour is,
<dt>
Whose brasen tops your worthy self made proud;
<dt>
The ground an altar, base for such a bliss
<dt>
With pity torn, because I sighed so loud.
<dt>
And since my skill no worship can impart,
<dt>
Make you an incense of my loving heart.

Sad, all alone, not long I musing sat,
<dt>
But that my thoughts compelled me to aspire;
<dt>
A laurel garland in my hand I gat,
<dt>
So the Muses I approached the nigher.
<dt>
My suit was this, a poet to become,
<dt>
To drink with them, and from the heavens be fed.
<dt>
Phoebus denied, and sware there was no room,
<dt>
Such to be poets as fond fancy led.
<dt>
With that I mourned and sat me down to weep;
<dt>
Venus she smiled, and smiling to me said,
<dt>
Come drink with me, and sit thee still, and sleep.
<dt>
This voice I heard; and Venus I obeyed.
<dt>
That poison sweet hath done me all this wrong,
<dt>
For now of love must needs be all my song.

Weary was love and sought to take his rest,
<dt>
He made his choice, upon a virgin's lap;
<dt>
And slyly crept from thence unto her breast,
<dt>
Where still he meant to sport him in his hap;
<dt>
The virgin frowned like Ph&amp;oelig;bus in a cloud;
<dt>
Go pack, sir boy, here is no room for such,
<dt>
My breast no wanton foolish boy must shroud."
<dt>
This said, my love did give the wag a touch;
<dt>
Then as the foot that treads the stinging snake
<dt>
Hastes to be gone, for fear what may ensue,
<dt>
So love my love was forced for to forsake,
<dt>
And for more speed, without his arrows flew.
<dt>
"Pardon," he said, "For why? You seemed to me
<dt>
My mother Venus in her pride to be."

The heavens beheld the beauty of my queen,
<dt>
And all amazed, to wonder thus began:
<dt>
"Why dotes not Jove, as erst we all have seen,
<dt>
And shapes himself like to a seemly man?
<dt>
Mean are the matches which he sought before,
<dt>
Like bloomless buds, too base to make compare,
<dt>
And she alone hath treasured beauty's store,
<dt>
In whom all gifts and princely graces are.
<dt>
Cupid replied: "I posted with the sun
<dt>
To view the maids that liv&eacute;d in those days,
<dt>
And none there was that might not well be won,
<dt>
But she, most hard, most cold, made of delays.
<dt>
Heavens were deceived, and wrong they do esteem,
<dt>
She hath no heat, although she living seem.

Love and my love did range the forest wild,
<dt>
Mounted alike, upon swift coursers both.
<dt>
Love her encountered, though he was a child.
<dt>
"Let's strive," saith he, whereat my love was wroth,
<dt>
And scorned the boy, and checked him with a smile.
<dt>
"I mounted am, and arm&eacute;d with my spear;
<dt>
Thou art too weak, thyself do not beguile;
<dt>
I could thee conquer if I naked were."
<dt>
With this ]ove wept, and then my love replied:
<dt>
"Kiss me, sweet boy, so weep my boy no more."
<dt>
Thus did my love, and then her force she tried;
<dt>
Love was made ice, that fire was before.
<dt>
A kiss of hers, as I, poor soul, do prove,
<dt>
Can make the hottest freeze and coldest love.

Love with her hair my love by force hath tied,
<dt>
To serve ber lips, her eyes, her voice, her hand;
<dt>
I smiled for joy, when I the boy espied
<dt>
To lie unchained and live at her command.
<dt>
She if she look, or kiss, or sing, or smile,
<dt>
Cupid withal doth smile, doth sing, doth kiss,
<dt>
Lips, hands, voice, eyes, all hearts that may beguile,
<dt>
Because she scorns all hearts but only this.
<dt>
Venus for this in pride began to frown
<dt>
That Cupid, born a god, enthralled should be.
<dt>
She in disdain her pretty son threw down,
<dt>
And in his place, with love she chain&eacute;d me.
<dt>
So now, sweet love, though I myself be thrall,
<dt>
Not her a goddess, but thyself I call.

My love amazed did blush herself to see,
<dt>
Pictured by art, all naked as she was.
<dt>
"How could the painter know so much by me,
<dt>
Or art effect what he hath brought to pass?
<dt>
It is not like he naked me hath seen,
<dt>
Or stood so nigh for to observe so much."
<dt>
No, sweet; his eyes so near have never been,
<dt>
Nor could his hands by art have cunning such;
<dt>
I showed my heart, wherein you printed were,
<dt>
You, naked you, as here you painted are;
<dt>
In that my love your picture I must wear,
<dt>
And show't to all, unless you have more care.
<dt>
Then take my heart, and place it with your own;
<dt>
So shall you naked never more be known.

Death in a rage assaulted once my heart
<dt>
With love of her, my love that doth deny.
<dt>
I scorned his force, and wished him to depart,
<dt>
I heartless was, and therefore could not die.
<dt>
I live in her, in her I placed my life,
<dt>
She guides my soul, and her I honour must.
<dt>
Nor is this life but yet a living strife,
<dt>
A thing unmeet, and yet a thing most just.
<dt>
Cupid enraged did fly to make me love,
<dt>
My heart lay guarded with those burning eyes
<dt>
The sparks whereof denied him to remove;
<dt>
So conquered now, he like a captive lies;
<dt>
Thus two at once by love were both undone,
<dt>
My heart not loved, and armless Venus' son.

Hard are the rocks, the marble, and the steel,

The ancient oak with wind and weather tossed;
<dt>
But you, my love, far harder do I feel
<dt>
Than flint, or these, or is the winter's frost.
<dt>
My tears too weak, your heart they cannot move;
<dt>
My sighs, that rock, like wind it cannot rent;
<dt>
Too tiger-like you swear you cannot love;
<dt>
But tears and sighs you fruitless back have sent.
<dt>
The frost too hard, not melted with my flame,
<dt>
I cinders am, and yet you feel no heat.
<dt>
Surpass not these, sweet love, for very shame,
<dt>
But let my tears, my vows, my sighs entreat;
<dt>
Then shall I say as I by trial find;
<dt>
These all are hard, but you, my love, are kind.

Love was laid down, all weary fast asleep,
<dt>
Whereas my love his armor took away;
<dt>
The boy awaked, and straight began to weep,
<dt>
But stood amazed, and knew not what to say.
<dt>
"Weep not, my boy," said Venus to her son,
<dt>
"Thy weapons none can wield, but thou alone;
<dt>
Licia the fair, this harm to thee hath done,
<dt>
I saw her here, and presently was gone;
<dt>
She will restore them, for she hath no need
<dt>
To take thy weapons where thy valour lies;
<dt>
For men to wound the Fates have her decreed,
<dt>
With favour, hands, with beauty, and with eyes."
<dt>
No, Venus, no: she scorns them, credit me;
<dt>
But robbed thy son that none might care for thee.

A painter drew the image of the boy,

Swift love, with wings all naked, and yet blind;
<dt>
With bow and arrows, bent for to destroy;
<dt>
I blamed his skill, and fault I thus did find
<dt>
"A needless task I see thy cunning take;
<dt>
Misled by love, thy fancy thee betrayed;
<dt>
Love is no boy, nor blind, as men him make,
<dt>
Nor weapons wears, whereof to be affrayed;
<dt>
But if thou, love, wilt paint with greatest skill
<dt>
A love, a maid, a goddess, and a queen;
<dt>
Wonder and view at Licia's picture still,
<dt>
For other love the world hath never seen;
<dt>
For she alone all hope all comfort gives;
<dt>
Men's hearts, souls, all, led by her favour lives."

In Ida vale three queens the shepherd saw,
<dt>
Queens of esteem, divine they were all three,
<dt>
A sight of worth. But I a wonder shaw,
<dt>
Their virtues all in one alone to be.
<dt>
Licia the fair, surpassing Venus' pride,
<dt>
(The matchless queen, commander of the gods,
<dt>
When drawn with doves she in her pomp doth ride)
<dt>
Hath far more beauty, and more grace by odds
<dt>
Juno, Jove's wife, unmeet to make compare,
<dt>
I grant a goddess, but not half so mild;
<dt>
Minerva wise, a virtue, but not rare;
<dt>
Yet these are mean, if that my love but smiled.
<dt>
She them surpasseth, when their prides are full

As far as they surpass the meanest trull.

I wish sometimes, although a worthless thing,

Spurred by ambition, glad to aspire,
<dt>
Myself a monarch, or some mighty king,
<dt>
And then my thoughts do wish for to be higher.
<dt>
But when I view what winds the cedars toss.
<dt>
What storms men feels that covet for renown,
<dt>
I blame myself that I have wished my loss,
<dt>
And scorn a kingdom, though it give a crown.
<dt>
Ah Licia, though the wonder of my thought,
<dt>
My heart's content, procurer of my bliss,
<dt>
For whom a crown I do esteem as naught,
<dt>
As Asia's wealth, too mean to buy a kiss!
<dt>
Kiss me, sweet love, this favor do for me;
<dt>
Then crowns and kingdoms shall I scorn for thee.

Enamored Jove commanding did entreat

Cupid to wound my love, which he denied,
<dt>
And swore he could not for she wanted heat
<dt>
And would not love, as he full oft had tried.
<dt>
Jove in a rage, impatient this to hear,
<dt>
Replied with threats; "I'll make you to obey!"
<dt>
Whereat the boy did fly away for fear
<dt>
To Licia's eyes, where safe intrenched he lay.
<dt>
Then Jove he scorned, and dared him to his face,
<dt>
For now more safe than in the heavens he dwelled,
<dt>
Nor could Jove's wrath do wrong to such a place
<dt>
Where grace and honour have their kingdom held.
<dt>
Thus in the pride and beauty of her eyes
<dt>
The seely boy the greatest god defies.

My love lay sleeping, where birds music made,
<dt>
Shutting her eyes, disdainful of the light;
<dt>
The heat was great but greater was the shade
<dt>
Which her defended from his burning sight.
<dt>
This Cupid saw, and came a kiss to take,
<dt>
Sucking sweet nectar from her sugared breath;
<dt>
She felt the touch, and blushed, and did awake,
<dt>
Seeing t'was love, which she did think was death,
<dt>
She cut his wings and caus&eacute;d him to stay,
<dt>
Making a vow, he should not thence depart,
<dt>
Unless to her the wanton boy could pay
<dt>
The truest, kindest and most loving heart.
<dt>
His feathers still she us&eacute;d for a fan,
<dt>
Till by exchange my heart his feathers won.

I stood amazed, and saw my Licia shine,

Fairer than Ph&amp;oelig;bus, in his brightest pride,
<dt>
Set forth in colors by a hand divine,
<dt>
Where naught was wanting but a soul to guide.
<dt>
It was a picture, that I could descry,
<dt>
Yet made with art so as it seemed to live,
<dt>
Surpassing fair, and yet it had no eye,
<dt>
Whereof my senses could no reason give.
<dt>
With that the painter bid me not to muse;
<dt>
"Her eyes are shut, but I deserve no blame;
<dt>
For if she saw, in faith, it could not choose
<dt>
But that the work had wholly been a flame,
<dt>
"Then burn me, sweet, with brightness of your eyes,

That ph&amp;oelig;nix-like from thence I may arise.

Grant, fairest kind, a kiss unto thy friend!
<dt>
A blush replied, and yet a kiss I had.
<dt>
It is not heaven that can such nectar send
<dt>
Whereat my senses all amazed were glad.
<dt>
This done, she fled as one that was affrayed,
<dt>
And I desired to kiss by kissing more;
<dt>
My love she frowned, and I my kissing stayed,
<dt>
Yet wished to kiss her as I did before.
<dt>
Then as the vine the propping elm doth clasp,
<dt>
Loath to depart till both together die,
<dt>
So fold me, sweet, until my latest gasp,
<dt>
That in thy arms to death I kissed may lie.
<dt>
Thus whilst I live for kisses I must call;
<dt>
Still kiss me, sweet, or kiss me not at all.

As are the sands, fair Licia, on the shore,
<dt>
Or colored flowers, garlands of the spring,
<dt>
Or as the frosts not seen, not felt before,
<dt>
Or as the fruits that autumn forth doth bring;
<dt>
As twinkling stars, the tinsel of the night,
<dt>
Or as the fish that gallop in the seas;
<dt>
As airs each part that still escapes our sight,
<dt>
So are my sighs, controllers of my ease.
<dt>
Yet these are such as needs must have an end,
<dt>
For things finite none else hath nature done;
<dt>
Only the sighs, which from my heart I send,
<dt>
Will never cease, but where they first begun.
<dt>
Accept them, sweet, as incense due to thee
<dt>
For you immortal made them so to be.

I swear, fair Licia, still for to be thine,

By heart, by eyes, by what I held most dear;
<dt>
Thou checked mine oath, and said: these were not mine,
<dt>
And that I had no right by them to swear.
<dt>
Then by my sighs, my passions, and my tears,
<dt>
My vows, my prayers, my sorrow, and my love,
<dt>
My grief, my joy, my hope, and hopeless fears,
<dt>
My heart is thine, and never shall remove.
<dt>
These are not thine, though sent unto thy view,
<dt>
All else I grant, by right they are thine own;
<dt>
Let these suffice that what I swear is true,
<dt>
And more than this if that it could be known.
<dt>
So shall all these though troubles ease my grief;

If that they serve to work in thee belief.

That time, fair Licia, when I stole a kiss,
<dt>
From off those lips, where Cupid lovely laid,
<dt>
I quaked for cold, and found the cause was this:
<dt>
My life which loved, for love behind me staid.
<dt>
I sent my heart my life for to recall,
<dt>
But that was held, not able to return,
<dt>
And both detained as captives were in thrall,
<dt>
And judged by her, that both by sighs should burn.
<dt>
Fair, burn them both, for that they were so bold,
<dt>
But let the altar be within thy heart;
<dt>
And I shall live because my life you hold,
<dt>
You that give life, to every living part;
<dt>
A flame I took whenas I stole the kiss;
<dt>
Take you my life, yet can I live with this.

First did I fear, when first my love began,

Possessed in fits by watchful jealousy

I sought to keep what I by favor won,

And brooked no partner in my love to be.
<dt>
But tyrant sickness fed upon my love,
<dt>
And spread his ensigns, dyed with color white;
<dt>
Then was suspicion glad for to remove,
<dt>
And loving much did fear to lose her quite.
<dt>
Erect, fair sweet, the colors thou didst wear;
<dt>
Dislodge thy griefs, the short'ners of content;

For now of life, not love, is all my fear,

Lest life and love be both together spent.

Licia my love was sitting in a grove,
<dt>
Tuning her smiles unto the chirping songs,
<dt>
But straight she spied where two together strove,
<dt>
Each one complaining of the other's wrongs.
<dt>
Cupid did cry lamenting of the harm;
<dt>
Jove's messenger, thou wrong'st me too too far;
<dt>
Use thou thy rod, rely upon the charm;
<dt>
Think not by speech my force thou canst debar.
<dt>
A rod, Sir boy, were fitter for a child,
<dt>
My weapons oft and tongue and mind you took;
<dt>
And in my wrong at my distress thou smiled,
<dt>
And scorned to grace me with a loving look.

Speak you, sweet love, for you did all the wrong

That broke his arrows, and did bind his tongue.

Thy father, sweet, whom danger did beset,

Escap&eacute;d all, and for no other end

But only this, that you he might beget,

Whom heavens decreed into the world to send.

Which stood and gazed, and gazing wax&eacute;d wan

To see a star himself that was more bright.
<dt>
Some did surmize she hid her from the sun,
<dt>
Of whom in pride she scorned for to be kissed,
<dt>
Or feared the harm by him to others done.
<dt>
But these the reason of this wonder missed,

Nor durst the sun, if that her face were bare

In greatest pride, presume to take a kiss.

But she more kind did show she had more care

Than with her eyes eclipse him of his bliss.

"All things that are, are subject unto me,

The heavens did grant; a goddess she was made,

Immortal, fair, unfit to suffer change.

In earth a goddess, what can be more strange?

So see the moon, how pale she doth arise,

Standing amazed, as though she durst not move;

So is my sweet much paler than the snow,

Constant her looks, these looks that cannot change.
<dt>
Mercury the next, a god sweet-tongued we know,
<dt>
But her sweet voice doth wonders speak more strange.
<dt>
The rising Sun doth boast him of his pride,
<dt>
And yet my love is far more fair than he.
<dt>
The warlike Mars can wieldless weapons guide,
<dt>
But yet that god is far more weak than she.
<dt>
The lovely Venus seemeth to be fair,
<dt>
But at her best my love is far more bright.

Saturn for age with groans doth dim the air,

Whereas my love with smiles doth give it light.

Then like perfume, resolv&eacute;d with a heat,

The fountain smoked, as if it thought to burn;

A wonder strange to see the cold so great,

And yet the fountain into smoke to turn.

I searched the cause, and found it to be this:

She touched the water, and it burned with love.

Now by her means it purebased hath tbat bliss,

For half those praises came not from his heart

Whose faith and love as yet was never found.
<dt>
Thy master's life, false Scrawl shall be thy doom;

Because he burns, I judge thee to the flame;

That I with her and both with thee may dwell.

Thy fact thus, Charon, both of us shall bless,

Thou save thy boat and I my love possess.

For if alone thou think to waft my love,

Her cold is such as can the sea command,

And frozen ice shall let thy boat to move,

Nor can thy forces row it from the land.
<dt>
But if thou friendly both at once shalt take,
<dt>
Thyself mayst rest. For why? My sighs will blow.
<dt>
Our cold and heat so sweet a thaw shall make,
<dt>
As that thy boat without thy help shall row.
<dt>
Then will I sit and glut me on those eyes
<dt>
Wherewith my life my eyes could never fill.
<dt>
Thus from my boat that comfort shall arise,
<dt>
The want whereof my life and hope did kill.
<dt>
Together placed so thou her scorn shalt cross,
<dt>
Where if we part thy boat must suffer loss.

Are those two stars, her eyes, my life's light gone,

By which my soul was fre&eacute;d from all dark?

And am I left distressed to live alone,

Where none my tears and mournful tale shall mark?
<dt>
Ah sun, why shine thy looks, thy looks like gold,
<dt>
When horsemen brave thou risest in the east?
<dt>
Ah Cynthia pale, to whom my griefs I told,
<dt>
Why do you both rejoice both man and beast?
<dt>
And I alone, alone that dark possess
<dt>
By Licia's absence brighter than the sun,
<dt>
Whose smiling light did ease my sad distress,
<dt>
And broke the clouds, when tears like rain begun.
<dt>
Heavens, grant that light and so me waking keep,

Or shut my eyes and rock me fast asleep!

Cruel fair love, I justly do complain
<dt>
Of too much rigor and thy heart unkind,
<dt>
That for mine eyes thou hast my body slain,
<dt>
And would not grant that I should favour find.
<dt>
I looked, fair love, and you my love looked fair,
<dt>
I sighed for love and you for sport did smile.
<dt>
Your smiles were such as did perfume the air,
<dt>
And this perfum&eacute;d did my heart beguile.
<dt>
Thus I confess the fault was in mine eyes,
<dt>
Begun with sighs and ended with a flame.
<dt>
I for your love did all the world despise,
<dt>
And in these poems honored have your name.
<dt>
Then let your love so with my fault dispense,

That all my parts feel not mine eyes' offense.

There shone a comet, and it was full west.

My thoughts presag&eacute;d what it did portend;

I found it threatened to my heart unrest,
<dt>
And might in time my joys and comfort end.
<dt>
I further sought and found it was a sun,
<dt>
Which day nor night did never use to set.
<dt>
It constant stood when heavens did restless run,
<dt>
And did their Virtues and their forces let.
<dt>
The world did muse and wonder what it meant,
<dt>
A sun to shine and in the west to rise;
<dt>
To search the truth, I strength and spirits spent;
<dt>
At length I found it was my Licia's eyes.
<dt>
Now never after soul shall live in dark,

That hath the hap this western sun to mark.

Then must I die whose heart elsewhere is clad,

And lifeless pass the greedy worms to feed;

Then must I pine that never comfort had,

And be distressed whose wound with tears doth bleed.
<dt>
Which if I do, why do I not wax cold?

Why rest I not like one that wants a heart?

Why move I still like him that life doth hold,

And sense enjoy both of my joy and smart?

So I, my love, enlightened with your shine,

A poet's skill within my soul I shroud,
<dt>
Not rude like that which finer wits decline,

But such as Muses to the best allowed.
<dt>
But when your figure and your shape is gone
<dt>
I speechless am like as I was before;
<dt>
Or if I write, my verse is filled with moan,
<dt>
And blurred with tears by falling in such store

Then muse not, Licia, if my Muse be slack,

For when I wrote I did thy beauty lack.

I saw, sweet Licia, when the spider ran
<dt>
Within your house to weave a worthless web,
<dt>
You present were and feared her with your fan,
<dt>
So that amaz&eacute;d speedily she fled.
<dt>
She in your house such sweet perfumes did smell,
<dt>
And heard the Muses with their notes refined,
<dt>
Thus filled with envy, could no longer dwell,
<dt>
But straight returned and at your house repined.
<dt>
Then tell me, spider, why of late I saw
<dt>
Thee lose thy poison, and thy bowels gone;
<dt>
Did these enchant and keep thy limbs in awe,
<dt>
And made thy forces to be small or none?
<dt>
No, no, thou didst by chance my Licia see,
<dt>
Who for her look Minerva seemed to thee.

Then heavens and earth shall accent both my pain,

And curse the time so cruel and so long.
<dt>
If you be kind, my queen, as you are fair,
<dt>
And aid my thoughts that still for conquest strive,
<dt>
Then will I sing and never more despair,
<dt>
And praise your kindness whilst I am alive.
<dt>
Till then I pay the tribute of my tears,
<dt>
To move thy mercy and thy constant truth.
<dt>
Respect, fair love, how these with sorrow wears
<dt>
The truest heart unless it find some ruth.

Then grace me, sweet, and with thy favor raise me,

Ah Licia, sigh and say thou art my own;

Nay, be my own, as you full oft have said.

So shall your truth unto the world be known,

And I resolved where now I am afraid.
<dt>
And if my tongue eternize can your praise,

Or silly speech increase your worthy fame,
<dt>
If ought I can, to heaven your worth can raise,
<dt>
The age to come shall wonder at the same.
<dt>
In this respect your love, sweet love, I told,

My faith and truth I vowed should be forever.
<dt>
You were the cause if that I was too bold;

Then pardon this my fault or love me never.

But if you frown I wish that none believe me,

For slain with sighs I'll die before I grieve thee.

When first the sun whom all my senses serve,

Began to shine upon this earthly round,

The heavens for her all graces did reserve,

That Pandor-like with all she might abound.
<dt>
Apollo placed his brightness in her eyes,
<dt>
His skill presaging and his music sweet.
<dt>
Mars gave his force; all force she now defies;
<dt>
Venus her smiles wherewith she Mars did meet;
<dt>
Python a voice, Diana made her chaste,
<dt>
Ceres gave plenty, Cupid lent his bow,
<dt>
Thetis his feet, there Pallas wisdom placed.

With these she queen-like kept a world in awe.

Yet all these honors deem&eacute;d are but pelf,

For she is much more worthy of herself.

O rose and lilies in a field most fair,

Where modest white doth make the red seem pale!

O voice whose accents live within my heart!

O heavenly hand that more than Atlas holds!

O sighs perfumed, that can release my smart!

O happy they whom in her arms she folds!

Seek out my love and she will tell you this.
