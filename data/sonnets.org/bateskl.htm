<p>
<dt>"Let me be blesséd for the peace I make."
<dt>God grant that old Shakespearean praise may glow,
<dt>Columbia, on thy brows most royal so,
<dt>Girt with a crown no mortal chances break.
<dt>The eagle that from ruined Rome we take
<dt>Hath but a pagan heart. His kingdoms go,
<dt>That the dove's kingdom still may come, and flow
<dt>O'er all the world. Ere the New Century wake,
<dt>Make straight her paths, her sweet Triumphal Way,
<dt>For not by might and power earth's sorrows cease;
<dt>Nor shall the stars in our young banner dim
<dt>While in its stripes is set the sign of Him
<dt>Who won by sufferance an eternal sway,
<dt>The King of Glory and the Prince of Peace.
<p>
<a name="020"></a><h2>Above the Battle</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Honor and pity for the smitten field,
<dt>The valorous ranks mown down like precious corn,
<dt>Whose want must famish love morn after morn,
<dt>Till Death, the good physician, shall have healed
<dt>The craving and the tearspent eyelids sealed.
<dt>Proud be the homes that for each cannon-torn,
<dt>Encrimsoned rampart have been left forlorn;
<dt>Holy the knells o'er fallen patriots pealed.
<p></p>
<dt>But they, above the battle, throng a space
<dt>Of starry silences and silver rest.
<dt>Commingled ghosts, they press like brothers through
<dt>White, dove-winged portals, where one Father's face
<dt>Atones their passion, as the ethereal blue
<dt>Serenes the fiery glows of east and west.
<p>
<a name="030"></a><h2>America to England</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name="031"></a><h3>1899</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Who would trust England, let him lift his eyes
<dt>To Nelson, columned o'er Trafalgar Square,
<dt>Her hieroglyph of duty, written where
<dt>The roar of traffic hushes to the skies;
<dt>Or mark, while Paul's vast shadow softly lies
<dt>On Gordon's statued sleep, how praise and prayer
<dt>Flush through the frank young faces clustering there
<dt>To con that kindred rune of sacrifice.
<dt>O England, no bland cloud-ship in the blue,
<dt>But rough oak plunging on o'er perilous jars
<dt>Of reef and ice, our faith will follow you
<dt>The more for tempest roar that strains your spars
<dt>And splits your canvas, be your helm but true,
<dt>Your courses shapen by the eternal stars.
<p>
<a name="032"></a><h3>1900</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>The nightmare melts at last, and London wakes
<dt>To her old habit of victorious ease.
<dt>More men, and more, and more for over-seas,
<dt>More guns until the giant hammer breaks
<dt>That patriot folk whom even God forsakes.
<dt>Shall not Great England work her will on these,
<dt>The foolish little nations, and appease
<dt>An angry shame that in her memory aches?
<dt>But far beyond the fierce-contested flood,
<dt>The cannon-planted pass, the shell-torn town,
<dt>The last wild carnival of fire and blood,
<dt>Beware, beware that dim and awful Shade,
<dt>Armored with Milton's sword and Cromwell's frown,
<dt>Affronted Freedom, of her own betrayed.
<p>
<a name="040"></a><h2>Epitome</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>A lonely burial-ground is on Cape Cod.
<dt>Claiming the privilege of age, each stone
<dt>Leans as it will, its scarred front overflown
<dt>With winged cherubic head. By grace of God,
<dt>Fulfilled in nature's gentle period,
<dt>All ghastly blazonry of skull and bone,
<dt>Muffled in moss and lichen-overgrown
<dt>Hath made its peace with beauty. Seldom trod
<dt>These grasses are, where, ghosts of old regret,
<dt>Once-tended vines run wild, but should a guest
<dt>Stoop there, this weathered epitaph to trace,
<dt>'Twill whisper him of all the human race.
<dt>Here lies, beneath a heartsease coverlet,
<dt>"Patience, wife of Experience," at rest.
<p>
<a name="050"></a><h2>The Tree of Song</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>An idle tree, whose timber builds no ships,
<dt>Whose wilding growth is all unfit to trace
<dt>Trim parallels in park and market-place,
<dt>Yet precious for the fragrant dew that drips
<dt>From blowing sprays to comfort fevered lips,
<dt>For lilt of hidden birds, for changeful grace
<dt>Of leafy shade that sunbeams interlace,
<dt>For heaven's dear blue about the spiring tips.
<dt>The world's great highway takes no heed of it,
<dt>Though paths wind thither through the April green.
<dt>The earth's blind forces feel no need of it;
<dt>Yet was there shaped, before the shaping hours,
<dt>A subtle league and sympathy between
<dt>This rhythmic tree and all effectual powers.
<p>
<a name="060"></a><h2>Musarum Sacerdos</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Who called himself your priest, Immortal Choir?
<dt>Not Dante, though in ruddiest altar-flame
<dt>He plunged his torch, and bore it through the shame
<dt>Of deepening hell to domes of starry fire,
<dt>In steadfast temple-service. Not that sire
<dt>Of glorious chant, our Milton, he who came
<dt>With solemn tread and vestments purged from blame
<dt>To swing the censer of divine desire.
<dt>But Horace, sipping at your crystal spring
<dt>As lightly as he quaffed his Sabine wine,
<dt>Caught up that lute, about whose golden string
<dt>The rose and myrtle he was deft to twine,
<dt>And sweetly sang, in pauses of the feast:
<dt>"The poet is the gods' anointed priest."
<p>
<a name="070"></a><h2>To Shelley</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name="071"></a><h3>I</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Hearing the autumnal wind, I muse on thee,
<dt>O Shelley, bird of most aerial note,
<dt>Whose songs came pulsing from a kindred throat,
<dt>As passionate, impetuous and free,
<dt>As sudden-shrill with visionary glee,
<dt>And hoarse with human agonies which smote
<dt>Thy gentlest heart till it would fain devote
<dt>Its music unto man's captivity,
<dt>Singing the day when wrath and pride and fear,
<dt>With the spectral troop of their unholy kind,
<dt>Shall melt in love, as shadows disappear
<dt>Before the sun; to evil unresigned,
<dt>Urging the nobler discontent I hear
<dt>In all these restless voices of the wind.
<p>
<a name="072"></a><h3>II</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>The summer comes again, by vale and hill
<dt>With blossoms fashioning her fragrant way;
<dt>But thou, the child of summer, to the day
<dt>Art long unknown, and all thy steps are still.
<dt>In summer thou wert born, and didst fulfill
<dt>Thy scanty urn of years while summer spray
<dt>Whitened the shores where thy mute image lay
<dt>Robbed of its poet. Hence the summers will
<dt>Seek thee in vain. The eye that watched the cloud
<dt>Hath locked its sight beneath the fallen lid;
<dt>The ear that heard the skylark's note is vowed
<dt>To a perpetual quiet. Thou art hid
<dt>Beyond the summers, and thy name belongs
<dt>But to a ceaseless melody of songs.
<p>
<a name="080"></a><h2>"Come unto Me"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>We labor, and are heavy-laden. Where
<dt>Shall we find rest unto our souls? We bleed
<dt>On thorn and flint, and rove in pilgrim weed
<dt>From shrine to shrine, but comfort is not there.
<dt>What went we out into thy desert bare,
<dt>O Human Life, to see? Thy greenest reed
<dt>Is Love, unmighty for our utmost need,
<dt>And shaken with the wind of our despair.
<dt>A voice from heaven like dew on Hermon falleth,
<dt>That voice whose passion paled the olive leaf
<dt>In thy dusk aisles, Gethsemane, thou blest
<dt>Of gardens. 'Tis the Man of Sorrows calleth,
<dt>The Man of Sorrows and acquaint with grief:
<dt>"Come unto Me, and I will give you rest."
<p>
<a name="090"></a><h2>Felices</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>We count them happy who have richly known
<dt>The sweets of life, the sunshine on the hills,
<dt>The mosses in the valley, love that fills
<dt>The heart with tears as fragrant as thine own,
<dt>O tender moonlight lily, over-blown,
<dt>When the inevitable season wills,
<dt>By gentle winds beside thy native rills--
<dt>We count them happy, yet not these alone.
<dt>There is a Crown of Thorns, Way of the Cross,
<dt>Consuming Fire that burns the spirit pure.
<dt>By luster of the gold set free from dross,
<dt>By light of heaven seen best through earth's obscure,
<dt>By the exceeding gain that waits on loss--
<dt>Behold, we count them happy who endure.
<p>
<a name="100"></a><h2>Thou Knowest</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Thou knowest, Thou Who art the soul of all
<dt>Selfless endeavor, how I longed to make
<dt>This deed of mine, adventured for love's sake,
<dt>Thy deed,--sweet grapes upon a sunny wall,
<dt>A rose whose petals into fragrance fall,
<dt>A glint of heaven glassed in some lonely lake
<dt>Amidst the heather and the fringing brake,
<dt>Our secret,--ah, Thou knowest.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it call
<dt>Only for pardon, still to Thee I bring
<dt>My poor, shamed deed that craved the Beautiful,
<dt>--To Thee, the Master-Artist, Who alone
<dt>Wilt of Thy grace see in this graceless thing
<dt>The pattern marred by the imperfect tool,
<dt>And know that dim, wronged pattern for Thine Own.
<p>
<a name="110"></a><h2>To a Crow</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Come hither, taunted bird, and I will stroke
<dt>Thy ruffled plumage with a verse, O <i>triste</i>
<dt>And sombre minstrel at our Twelfth Night feast,
<dt>A music masquerading in thy croak.
<dt>How often, when the wild March mornings broke,
<dt>Have I descried thee, like a demon priest,
<dt>Heaping hoarse curses on the riotous East
<dt>From the bare branches of some tossing oak!
<dt>Yet ever welcome is thy wizard flight,
<dt>--Most welcome now, when Earth lies imaging
<dt>The sleep of death beneath a winding-sheet
<dt>Of frozen snow intolerably white,
<dt>A pallid waste crossed by the sudden, fleet,
<dt>Beautiful shadow of thy sable wing.
<p>
<a name="120"></a><h2>Illumined</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>A naked tree against the sunset sky,
<dt>A tall, black tree whose leaves of emerald sheen,
<dt>That blissful birds were wont to peep between,
<dt>Long since have fallen. Through her summit high
<dt>The winter winds have swept with bitter cry
<dt>And left her desolate, a crownless queen,
<dt>Yet beautiful for amber lights serene
<dt>That all the ebon outlines glorify.
<dt>The Light! The Light! 'Mid her abandoned, bare,
<dt>Stript branches like a tracery of jet,
<dt>Streams heavenly splendor. Fairer to behold
<dt>Than all those summer graces they forget,
<dt>Her boughs are as a shadow on the air,
<dt>A foil, a fretwork in the flood of gold.
<p>
<a name="130"></a><h2>Into the Night</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Arise, come forth into the night! Arise,
<dt>Belovéd, for her dusky lips will teach
<dt>A nobler tale than any mortal speech,
<dt>And the pure lights of her eternal eyes,
<dt>Beyond all anger, sorrow and surprise,
<dt>Look with the same large loveliness on each,
<dt>Not human-fashion, scorning who beseech
<dt>To cherish those who scorn. The gleaming skies
<dt>Are royal with old goddesses and queens
<dt>Whose faces lit the earth till, banished thence,
<dt>They watch from heaven the fair, familiar scenes
<dt>That nevermore shall do them reverence,
<dt>Though humbled Cassiopaea earthward leans,
<dt>And Cynthia sheds her old beneficence.
<p>
<a name="140"></a><h2>When It Befortunes Us</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>When it befortunes us, who love so dearly,
<dt>To hurt each other, let us haste to wring
<dt>This joy from our remorseful passioning,--
<dt>The wound is witness that we love sincerely.
<dt>So slight a weapon, word or silence merely,
<dt>Would scarce effect surprisal of a sting,
<dt>Were't not my word, thy silence, for we cling
<dt>One soul together. Life allots austerely
<dt>Unto the rose of love the thorny power
<dt>To tear the heart, but ah, love's anodyne!
<dt>The prick but proves the presence of the flower,
<dt>Our one white rose from gardens all divine.
<dt>Then, only then, could grief outlast her hour
<dt>Were I ungrieved by least rebuff of thine.
<p>
<a name="150"></a><h2>"The Rest Is Silence"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name="151"></a><h3>I</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>The shadow of Death's wing had fallen grey
<dt>Upon her face, the mother-face, our star
<dt>Of home since life first read its calendar
<dt>Within our smiles; we felt her slip away,
<dt>Our vain hold clinging to an empty clay,
<dt>Down that hushed valley where the white mists are,
<dt>On to its utmost verge, so far, so far
<dt>That her return was but as spirits may
<dt>Briefly revisit earth. For oh, she shone
<dt>Transfigured, yet so winsome, that our awe
<dt>Was blended with her own beatitude.
<dt>The burden of her fourscore years was gone;
<dt>Escaped from Time, she mocked his mighty law;
<dt>Her children looked upon her maidenhood.
<p>
<a name="152"></a><h3>II</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Eager and shy, as when among her peers
<dt>A girl will pour her confidence, she told
<dt>In voice where laughter ran a thread of gold
<dt>A history all novel to our ears.
<dt>Her blissful eyes oblivious of tears,
<dt>With lingering touch she one by one unrolled
<dt>Her bridal memories from fold on fold
<dt>Of fragrant silence. Dead thse fifty years
<dt>Was he with whom, young hand in hand, she went
<dt>To their first home, which simple neighbor-folk
<dt>Had filled with garden-bloom and forest scent;
<dt>Yet still of him, and that June path they fared,
<dt>Those welcoming flowers, her failing accents spoke;
<dt>--Of how Love led her to a place prepared.
<p>
<a name="153"></a><h3>III</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>When the bruised heart, bewildered first and numb,
<dt>Quickened to pain, how passing strange it seemed
<dt>To miss her comfort! She, who still esteemed
<dt>Old lore above the schools, would she not come
<dt>With potency of hoarded balsamum,
<dt>To heal the hurt? Thus craving her, I dreamed.
<dt>Before me, sundering east from west, there gleamed
<dt>A marble wall, illimitable, dumb,
<dt>A blank of white! when lo, her own sweet face,
<dt>With no more halo than the crispy lace
<dt>I knew so well, from sudden casement smiled,
<dt>--Her blithe, audacious self, infringing so
<dt>With stolen peep Death's new punctiliom,
<dt>Breaking his code to reassure her child.
<p>
<a name="160"></a><h2>"Short Day and Long Remembrance"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name="161"></a><h3>I</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Our Wellesley knew thee but a few swift years,
<dt>A maiden spirit, fresh as morning skies,
<dt>Pale beauty of the face and frank young eyes
<dt>With privacies of tenderness and tears.
<dt>Half shy, half proud amid thy clustering peers
<dt>Thou borest thee in queenly lily wise,
<dt>Yet swaying toward them in a sweet surprise
<dt>Of love and faith--prophetic atmospheres.
<dt>For summer shone, and goldenly thine heart
<dt>Bloomed into bliss, but now--oh, strange, new ache
<dt>That makes itself familiar--now thou art
<dt>A broken lily, all untimely dimmed,
<dt>A broken lily, for whose vanished sake
<dt>Our speech is faint, our eyes are overbrimmed.
<p>
<a name="162"></a><h3>II</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>There is a life outwearing even grief.
<dt>Our shining lily, of the sunbeams fain,
<dt>Smit by a sudden vehemence of rain
<dt>Is dashed to earth with ruined cup and leaf;
<dt>But Death, her troubler, holds his mortal fief
<dt>Of Love the overlord, whose meads retain
<dt>A perfume sweeter for the bruise and stain,
<dt>Abiding fragrance of a blossom brief.
<dt>Transplanted, be it so, to gardens bright,
<dt>Where drooping lilies, sprent with honey-dew,
<dt>By angel touches wax more dazzling white
<dt>Than eye conceives beneath this baffling blue,
<dt>At least remains to us of shadowed sight
<dt>Thy folding effluence of fair and true.
<p>
<a name="163"></a><h3>III</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>God pity all whose hearts are anguish-torn
<dt>For loss of her, but softest mercies flow
<dt>On these, her little ones, who cannot know
<dt>What cause their baby voices have to mourn.
<dt>In vain their fitful cries pursue her borne
<dt>From rooms belovéd, yet content to go,
<dt>Sealed in that ivory trance from joy and woe,
<dt>Her bridal raiment now serenely worn.
<dt>Too young for memory, too young to miss
<dt>Her cherishments, and yet it may not be
<dt>As they had never felt the mother-kiss,
<dt>Nor reached their wandering hands to catch her smile;
<dt>But, haply, dreamland keeps some charméd isle
<dt>Where love shall brood them safe from storm and sea.
<p>
<a name="170"></a><h2>Only a Year</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Only a year, but how art thou exalted
<dt>In that remoteness of unanswering death!
<dt>Not words could utter what thy silence saith,
<dt>For oft in fellowship thy words we faulted,
<dt>Pointing how here and there the logic halted;
<dt>But now that God hath hushed the laboring breath,
<dt>Thy silence all thy words interpreteth,
<dt>Serene, majestic silence o'er us vaulted
<dt>As the blue arch of sky. Only a year,
<dt>And thou, who wast familiar, art become
<dt>A name of awe. What ranked as commonplace,
<dt>Mere daily running of the daily race,
<dt>Is waxen to heroic. Life is dumb
<dt>And waits on Death to make her meanings clear.
<p>
<a name="180"></a><h2>The Funeral of Phillips Brooks</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name="181"></a><h3>I</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>White lies the winter on the weary land,
<dt>Winter of many a loss and many a grief;
<dt>Yet must this burial day be counted chief
<dt>Of sorrows and most sore to understand;
<dt>For God hath laid the lightning of His hand
<dt>On His own signal tower, for all too brief
<dt>A date outsoaring mists of unbelief
<dt>To drink the living blue, a beacon grand.
<dt>But whilst the desolate throng without the portal
<dt>Of solemn Trinity in silence waits,
<dt>As listening for the beat of passing wing,
<dt>To view that clay which harbored an immortal,
<dt>Down the bleak air a tender breath of spring
<dt>Steals like a waft from Heaven's glad-opening gates.
<p>
<a name="182"></a><h3>II</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Within the beauteous walls again too strait
<dt>For the wistful flocks who mourn their shepherd gone,--
<dt>Since here all creeds one shining garment don,
<dt>One seamless robe,--our heavy spirits wait
<dt>On the old Hebraic anthem passionate
<dt>And fall of hallowed words that bear upon
<dt>Their cadences strange consolation won
<dt>From centuries of faith reverberate.
<dt>But oh, the empty pulpit eloquent
<dt>Of death, the sable pulpit over all!
<dt>Yet even here is soul with flesh at strife;
<dt>For wise and tender was the hand that lent
<dt>A glowing wreath to that funereal pall,--
<dt>Against the gloom the exultant flush of life.
<p>
<a name="183"></a><h3>III</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>"For all the saints who from their labors rest"--
<dt>White gleam the lilies on the lifted bier,
<dt>As reverently the youthful bearers rear
<dt>Their sad, belovéd burden, pacing west,
<dt>Whilst all that host, as from a single breast,
<dt>One voice of praise outringing sweet and clear,
<dt>Peals the triumphal chant he loved to hear:
<dt>"Thy name, O Jesu, be forever blest."
<dt>Ah, turn and watch the pageantry of woe
<dt>Out through the darkened door. The glory-hymn
<dt>Wavers a space, but swells again, for lo!
<dt>The dismal pomp of death, the mourners slow,
<dt>The shrouded casket on the vision dim,
<dt>That gleam of Easter lilies dazzles so.
<p>
<a name="184"></a><h3>IV</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>The train wends outward, where new thousands wait
<dt>Beneath an ampler temple-arch of sky,
<dt>To speed with murmurous prayer and paean high
<dt>The royal progress of that sombre state;
<dt>On through the streets to sorrow consecrate;
<dt>On where thy sons, hushed Harvard, gather nigh,
<dt>To glean a blessing from the passing by;
<dt>And so to Auburn's unrestoring gate.
<dt>Is this thy victory, Death? Not thine, not thine,
<dt>Howe'er to grief we grant her natural throes.
<dt>He prophesied of life;we asked a sign,
<dt>So little mortals know for what they pray,
<dt>And by his open grave amid the snows
<dt>A chastened city keeps her Easter day.

<dt>From dim aerial depths, a silver light

<dt>A domelike summit, gloriously bright,
<p></p>
<dt>The adoration of the gazing eye,

<dt>In sparkling radiance on the blue repose
<dt>Of heaven, thy diamond-crusted veils, thy frore,
<dt>Virginal vesture of eternal snows?
<p></p>
<dt>We have beheld the vision. Evermore
<dt>Must our poor life be nobler than before.

<dt>"Here will I build a temple, I the Lord,
<dt>Ramses the Great, crowned with the Double Crown,
<dt>Son of the Sun, whose chariot wheels swept down
<dt>The hosts of Kadesh, and whose thirsty sword
<dt>Hath revelled in this Ethiopian horde,
<dt>Smiting their necks. To teach them my renown,
<dt>Pyloned and obelisked in many a town,
<dt>I build a shrine wherein to be adored.
<dt>Take me this mountain of the living rock;
<dt>Hew it and hollow; carve its river-face
<dt>As mountain never yet was carved, to bear
<dt>My likenesses repeated like a prayer;
<dt>Then probe it to its inmost secret place,
<dt>And sculpture godhood from the savage block."

<dt>The temple-cliff against the soft, deep blue
<dt>Of Nubia's star-sown sky stands ashen-grey,
<dt>Save where like sifted snow or frosted spray
<dt>The moonlight blanches it. Supreme in view
<dt>Sit throned the four colossi, emblems true
<dt>Of thine illimitable pride, thou clay,
<dt>Dust of the desert, Ramses, strewn to-day
<dt>In shattered images thine Egypt through.
<dt>Yet the stupendous Four are meek to Him
<dt>Graved at the hewn rock's heart, eternal, dim,
<dt>A God with Gods. With that dread Trinity,
<dt>Burning Harmachis, and the death-white Ptah
<dt>And, Lord of Thrones, the high-plumed Ammon-Ra,
<dt>The Pharaoh mates his mock divinity.

<dt>The dawn-light steals across the solemn Nile,
<dt>Warms the huge knees and stony, silent lips
<dt>Of those ranged giants, through the portal slips
<dt>And up the great Osiris columns, while
<dt>Chamber on chamber brightens, aisle on aisle.
<dt>The walls wax wonderful with mystic ships
<dt>And pageantry of war. Blue lotus dips
<dt>In sacrifice, and sudden faces smile.
<dt>Yet poignant, penetrant, the level beam
<dt>Strikes down those dusky courts to that last gloom
<dt>Of Zenith Splendor, and the Sun in Tomb
<dt>Of Night, with Ramses, their beloved one,
<dt>And fires their altar with a fleeting gleam.

<dt>The treasure of the valley, red and tall
<dt>They rise, those sandstone fragments, overgrown
<dt>With fern and ivy and sweet blossom sown
<dt>By pitying winds. From broken arch and wall
<dt>The harebell glistens; nightshade thickets pall
<dt>Bruised effigy and sunken altar-stone.
<dt>What man rejected, Nature makes her own;
<dt>Her comfort creeps where cross and pillar fall.
<dt>Still sacred, though in lieu of white procession
<dt>Of chanting monks, the mossy shafts look down
<dt>On children's blithe-voiced play; though robins nest
<dt>In sculptured angel-wing and carven crown;
<dt>Perchance more sacred, for the heart's confession
<dt>Lies bare to Him, the heart's eternal Quest.

<p></p>
<dt>These are the hills our poet Langland trod,
<dt>"Weary forwandered," from the sunrise flush
<dt>To amber evening thrilled by merle and thrush,
<dt>Long Will, whose sombre soul went pilgrim-shod
<dt>Seeking Saint Truth. Men called him churl and clod;
<dt>He heard them not, rapt in his dream's deep hush;
<dt>Hardly he heard the merry waters gush;
<dt>Still wandering with no company but God.
<dt>These hills are holy ground because of thee,
<dt>O earthborn who wouldst make no peace with earth,
<dt>Craving that visionary clime where all
<dt>Thy troubled field of folk at last shall be
<dt>One brotherhood in labor and in mirth,
<dt>And not a blessing undivided fall.

<p></p>
<dt>They chime, they chime, the sweet cathedral bells,
<dt>Cleaving my cloudy thought, if murkiest cloud
<dt>E'er hung so heavy as, on spirit bowed,
<dt>This drear confusion weighs. Where is it dwells
<dt>My truth of soul? What veil of shifting spells,
<dt>Duties unduteous, glamours disallowed,
<dt>Myself doth from myself forever shroud?
<dt>Once more that silver-throated peal outwells.
<dt>Amid the chanting throng I kneel alone,
<dt>Mute, dull of heart, yet fain to screen the brow.
<dt>Interpret me to Heaven, deep organ tone!

<h3><i>Matins</i></h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Clamor of rooks from pinnacle and spire
<dt>Hails an encrimsoned east; but chill and gray
<dt>Below the pillared vistas arch away
<dt>Through shadowy nave to glory-smitten choir,
<dt>Where Orient sunbeams thrill with jeweled fire
<dt>The dreaming glass that blossoms unto day
<dt>In roseate plumes and golden halo-ray
<dt>And seraph faces rapt with God-desire.
<dt>Ah, yet these walls, though hoary with the woe
<dt>And shrift of centuries, are all too strait
<dt>For such a splendor. From the elm-roofed lawn,
<dt>Where thostles chant and streams responsive flow,
<dt>I'll worship Him on Whom my longings wait,
<dt>Before the great east window of the dawn.</dt>
