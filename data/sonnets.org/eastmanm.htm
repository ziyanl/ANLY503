<p>
<dt>The sad light sayeth how all Autumn grieves,
<dt>And how this rainy mist in heaven high
<dt>Doth wake the sorrowings that deepest lie.
<dt>Behold the silent forms shorn of their leaves,
<dt>The elm, the maple, and the antique oak--
<dt>With gestures sorrowful they pray the sky.
<dt>Behold the rain-pools where the brown leaves soak,
<dt>And the same mournful branches mirrored lie.
<dt>See how the sensuous mist, cool-smelling, slips
<dt>Like a wilful garment down from those wet limbs
<dt>Which will be gracious to the singing lips
<dt>Of the expected wind!--For he will come!
<dt>I hear him waken as the twilight dims,
<dt>And my heart quickens, and my words are dumb!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>"The passions of a child attend his dreams"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The passions of a child attend his dreams.
<dt>He lives, loves, hopes, remembers, is forlorn,
<dt>For legendary creatures, whom he deems
<dt>Not too unreal--until one golden morn
<dt>The gracious, all-awaking sun shines in
<dt>Upon his tranquil pillow, and his eyes
<dt>Are touched, and opened greatly, and begin
<dt>To drink reality with rich surprise.
<p>
<dt>I loved the impetuous souls of ancient story--
<dt>Heroic characters, kings, queens, whose wills
<dt>Like empires rose, achieved, and fell, in glory.
<dt>I was a child--until the radiant dawn,
<dt>Thy beauty, woke me. O thy spirit fills
<dt>The stature of those heroes, they are gone!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>To a Meadow Lark</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When the enkindling spring upon the lea
<dt>Was quenched with water, and the rainy throng
<dt>Of clouds perpetual had drowned her song--
<dt>Still thou didst lift thy heart and float to me,
<dt>Over the mist, thy lonely melody!
<dt>O swell again the throat, and thrill the tongue,
<dt>And rouse, and ravish with thy passion young,
<dt>The adoring air that drinks thine ecstasy!
<dt>She hides her beauty in the wavy shroud
<dt>Of April's swift and half-translucent cloud--
<dt>My love is lost in a more heavy shadow!
<dt>My love is buried in the arms of grief!
<dt>O send to her across the mourning meadow
<dt>That brighter sorrow thine--that music brief!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>To an Early Riser</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The eastern hill hath scarce unveiled his head,
<dt>And the deliberate sky hath but begun
<dt>To meditate upon a future sun,
<dt>When thou dost rise from thy impatient bed.
<dt>Thy morning prayer unto the stars is said.
<dt>And not unlike a child, the penance done
<dt>Of sleep, thou goest to thy serious fun,
<dt>Exuberant--yet with a whisper tread!
<p>
<dt>And when that lord doth to the world appear,
<dt>The jovial sun, he leans on his old hill,
<dt>And levels forth to thee a golden smile--
<dt>Thee in his garden, where each warming year
<dt>Thou toilest in all joy with him, to fill
<dt>And flood the soil with Summer for a while.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>"As the crag eagle to the zenith's height"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As the crag eagle to the zenith's height
<dt>Wings his pursuit in his exalted hour,
<dt>Of her the tempest-reared, whose airy power
<dt>Of plume and passion challengeth his flight
<dt>To that wild altitude where they unite,
<dt>In mutual tumultuous victory
<dt>And the swift sting of natures ecstasy,
<dt>Their shuddering pinions and their skyward might--
<dt>As they, the strong, to the full height of heaven
<dt>Bear up that joy which to the strong is given,
<dt>Thus, thus do we, whose stormy spirits quiver
<dt>In the bold air of utter liberty,
<dt>Clash equal at our highest, I and thee,
<dt>Unconquered and unconquering forever!
