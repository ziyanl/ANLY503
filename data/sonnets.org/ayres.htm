<p>
<dt>Let others sing of Mars, and of his train,
<dt>Of great exploits, and honourable scars,
<dt>The many dire effects of Civil Wars,
<dt>Death's triumphs, and encomiums of the slain.
<p>
<dt>I sing the conflicts I myself sustain,
<dt>With her (Great Love) the cause of all my cares,
<dt>Who wounds with looks, and fetters with her hairs.
<dt>This mournful tale requires a tragic strain.
<p>
<dt>Eyes were the Arms, did first my Peace control,
<dt>Wounded by them, a source of Tears there sprung,
<dt>Running like blood from my afflicted soul;
<dt>Thou Love, to whom this conquest does belong,
<dt>Leave me at least the comfort to condole,
<dt>And as thou wound'st my Heart, inspire my Song.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Request: To Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O Love, who in my breast's most noble part,
<dt>Didst that fair Image lodge, that Form Divine,
<dt>In whom the sum of Heavenly Graces shine,
<dt>And there ingrav'dst it with thy golden dart.
<p>
<dt>Now, mighty Workman! Help me by thy art,
<dt>(Since my dull pen trembles to strike a line)
<dt>That I on paper copy the design,
<dt>By thee express'd so lively in my heart.
<p>
<dt>Lend me, when I this great attempt do try,
<dt>A feather from thy wings, that whilst to write,
<dt>My hand's employ'd, my thoughts may soar on high;
<dt>Thy Torch, which fires our hearts and burns so bright,
<dt>My darker fancy let its flame supply,
<dt>And through my numbers dart celestial light.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Complaint</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Now angry Juno sends from Heaven in spite
<dt>Rivers and Seas, instead of moderate showers
<dt>Horror invests the world, and the bright Hours
<dt>Of Delos' God, are chang'd to dismal Night.
<p>
<dt>So crowds of anxious thoughts on ev'ry side
<dt>Invade my soul, and through my restless eyes,
<dt>I shed such streams of tears, my heart e'en tries
<dt>Death's pangs, whilst I by force in life abide.
<p>
<dt>But the brisk gales, which rising by and by,
<dt>Where Sol at night in Thetis' lap shall lie,
<dt>Will make Heaven clear, and drive away the rain.
<dt>Ah, Cynthia! That the blasts or sighs I vent,
<dt>Could ease my breast of cloudy discontent,
<dt>Which still with fresh assaults renews my pain.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Invites Poets and Historians to Write in Cynthia's Praise</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Come all ye Wits, that with immortal rhymes,
<dt>Glory to others, and yourselves, create:
<dt>And you that gratify the future times,
<dt>Whilst tales of Love and battles ye relate;
<p>
<dt>Come, turn your studies, and your eyes this way,
<dt>This theme will crown your heads with lasting bays,
<dt>'Tis Cynthia's beauty, Heavenly Cynthia;
<dt>Come swell your volumes all with Cynthia's praise.
<p>
<dt>Posterity will then your works admire,
<dt>And for her sake shall them as jewels prize,
<dt>All things to Cynthia's glory must conspire,
<dt>She shall be worshipp'd with the deities.
<dt>To her make foreign lands pay honours due,
<dt>Thus shall you live by her, and she by you.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Cynthia on Horseback</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Fair Cynthia mounted on her sprightly pad,
<dt>Which in white robe with silver fringe was clad,
<dt>And swift as wind his graceful steps did move,
<dt>As with his beauteous guide he'd been in love.
<p>
<dt>Though fierce, yet humble still to her command,
<dt>Obeying ev'ry touch of her fair hand;
<dt>Her golden bit his foaming mouth did check,
<dt>It spread his crest, and rais'd his bending neck.
<p>
<dt>She was the rose upon this hill of snow,
<dt>Her sparkling beauty made the glorious show;
<dt>Whence secret flames men in their bosoms took:
<dt>The Graces and the Cupids her surround,
<dt>Attending her, while cruel she does wound,
<dt>With switch her horse, and hearts with ev'ry look.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>On the Death of Cynthia's Horse</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Whate'er the world could boast of fair or good,
<dt>Thy back with pride has borne, thou happy Horse,
<dt>By which thou'rt fall'n in middle of thy course,
<dt>Too feeble to sustain so great a load.
<p>
<dt>Oh happy fall! Oh dying full of bliss!
<dt>Whilst she that guided Love did guide thy head,
<dt>Big with this thought, thou willingly art dead,
<dt>Scorning another burden after this.
<p>
<dt>A Heaven of Beauty over-press'd thy back,
<dt>This might have made Alcides' shoulders crack,
<dt>And Atlas truckle under such a weight:
<dt>Heav'n thee amongst its horses long'd to see,
<dt>As here the world was late in love with thee,
<dt>When carrying her who to the sun gave light.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>Of Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If Love it be not, what is this I feel?
<dt>If it be Love, what Love is, fain I'd know?
<dt>If good, why the effects severe and ill?
<dt>If bad, why do its torments please me so?

<dt>If willingly I burn, should I complain?
<dt>If 'gainst my will, what helps it to lament?
<dt>Oh living Death! oh most delightful pain!
<dt>How comes all this, if I do not consent?

<dt>If I consent, 'tis madness then to grieve;
<dt>Amidst these storms, in a weak boat I'm tost
<dt>Upon a dangerous sea, without relief,
<dt>No help from Reason, but in Error lost.
<p>
<dt>Which way in this distraction shall I turn,
<dt>That freeze in Summer, and in Winter burn?
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>On a Fair Beggar</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Barefoot and ragged, with neglected hair,
<dt>She whom the Heavens at once made poor and fair,
<dt>With humble voice and moving words did stay,
<dt>To beg an alms of all who pass'd that way.
<dt>But thousands viewing her became her prize,
<dt>Willingly yielding to her conquering eyes,
<dt>And caught by her bright hairs, whilst careless she
<dt>Makes them pay homage to her poverty.
<p>
<dt>So mean a boon, said I, what can extort
<dt>From that fair mouth, where wanton Love to sport
<dt>Amidst the pearls and rubies we behold?
<dt>Nature on thee has all her treasures spread,
<dt>Do but incline thy rich and precious head,
<dt>And those fair locks shall pour down showers of gold.
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>A Sonnet, out of Italian, from Claudjo Achillini</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dd><i>Written by a Nymph in Her Own Blood</i>
<p>
<dt>Since, cruel Thyrsis, you my torments slight,
<dt>And take no notice of my amorous flame,
<dt>In these vermilion letters thus I write
<dt>My bloody reasons to confirm the same.
<p>
<dt>These of my passion are the lively marks,
<dt>Which from my veins you here in blood see writ,
<dt>Touch them, your breast will kindle with the sparks,
<dt>The ardent characters are reeking yet.
<p>
<dt>Nor can my pen alone my heart explain,
<dt>My very soul o'ercharg'd with grief, I fain
<dt>Would send enclos'd herein, the truth to prove.
<dt>And if I've been too sparing of my blood,
<dt>This is the reason why I stopp'd the flood,
<dt>I would not spoil the face I'd have you love.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>The Rose and Lily</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Courted by Cupids, and the amorous air,
<dt>Upon a shady throne, at her repose,
<dt>She sate, than whom, none e'er so sweet or fair:
<dt>It was the Queen of Flowers, the blushing rose.
<p>
<dt>With no less pride, upon his bed of state,
<dt>A Lily, pale with envy, look'd that way;
<dt>With humble flowers, encompass'd round he sate,
<dt>And scorn'd the sceptre at her feet to lay.
<p>
<dt>To arms, with thorns and prickles, they prepare
<dt>And each designs to try it out by war;
<dt>Till on good counsel, they in rule combine:
<dt>So in your face, the lovely White and Red,
<dt>Cynthia, I see all quarrels banish&eacute;d,
<dt>And Rose and Lily do in empire join.
<p>
<a name=110></a><h2>On Signor Pietro Reggio His Setting to Music Several of Mr. Cowley's Poems</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If Theban Pindar rais'd his country's fame,
<dt>Whilst its great deeds he does in odes rehearse,
<dt>And they made greater by his noble verse
<dt>In gratitude are trophies to his name:
<p>
<dt>Then English Pindar shall for ever live,
<dt>Since his divine and lofty poetry
<dt>Secur'd, great Regglo, by thy harmony,
<dt>Shall to itself immortal glory give.
<p>
<dt>The world's amaz'd to hear the sweet consent,
<dt>Betwixt thy charming voice and instrument,
<dt>They'd stop the bays which from Apollo fled;
<dt>Thy skilful notes would make in full career
<dt>Phoebus, the God of Music, stay to hear,
<dt>And with his Daphne crown thy rival head.

<a name=120></a><h2>On the Picture of Cavalier Guarini, of <i>Il Pastor Fido</i>, Painted by the Famous Borgianni, and Set up in His Funeral Pile at Rome</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>You, who to fam'd Guarini, now he's dead,
<dt>Your verses consecrate, and statues rear,
<dt>For that sweet Padan swan your tears have shed,
<dt>Sweetest that ever did, or will sing here.
<p>
<dt>Behold this picture on his fun'ral pile,
<dt>Your mournful spirits 'twill with joy revive,
<dt>Tho' th' artist cheats your senses all the while,
<dt>For 'tis but paint which you would swear does live.
<p>
<dt>This serves to keep our friend in memory,
<dt>Since Death hath robb'd us of his better part,
<dt>And that he so might live as ne'er to die,
<dt>He drew himself too, but with diff'rent art.
<dt>Judge, which with greatest life and spirit looks,
<dt>Borgianni's painting, or Guarini's Books.
<p>
<a name=130></a><h2>Love's Contrariety</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I make no war, and yet no peace have found,
<dt>With heat I melt, when starv'd to death with cold.
<dt>I soar to Heav'n, while grovelling on the ground,
<dt>Embrace the world, yet nothing do I hold.
<p>
<dt>I'm not confin'd, yet cannot I depart,
<dt>Nor loose the chain tho' not a captive led;
<dt>Love kills me not, yet wounds me to the heart,
<dt>Will neither have m' alive, nor have me dead.
<p>
<dt>Being blind, I see; not having voice, I cry:
<dt>I wish for Death, while I of Life make choice;
<dt>I hate myself, yet love you tenderly;
<dt>Do feed of tears, and in my grief rejoice.
<p>
<dt>Thus, Cynthia, all my health is but disease;
<dt>Both life and death do equally displease.
<p>
<a name=140></a><h2>Love's Garden: Translated from Girolamo Preti</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I to Love's garden came, <a href="#999">with</a> my attire
<dt>Was wove with herbs of Hope, and of Desire,
<dt>Branches of Trouble too by me were worn,
<dt>Whose flowers and fruit were Prejudice and Scorn.
<p>
<dt>'Twas wall'd with Pain, and Anguish round about,
<dt>And from a thousand places issu'd out
<dt>Water of Grief and Air of Sighs, beside
<dt>Deceit and Cruelty, did there reside.
<p>
<dt>Pride was the Keeper; and to cultivate
<dt>Was Jealousy who still with mortal Hate,
<dt>Tare up my happiness ere it could grow;
<dt>Whilst, like a madman, thus I strive to sow,
<dt>Under the shadow of a thought that's kind,
<dt>I plough in stone, dig water, stop the wind.
<p>
<a name=150></a><h2>A Sonnet, of Petrarch, on the Death of Laura</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I fill with sighs the air whene'er I stand
<dt>On yon' high hill, and thence survey the plain,
<dt>Where Laura, she who could my heart command,
<dt>Did in her Earthly Paradise remain.
<p>
<dt>For now she's dead, and left me here alone,
<dt>Griev'd for her loss, that I could gladly die;
<dt>Drowning my eyes in making of my moan,
<dt>My tears have left no space about me dry.
<p>
<dt>There is no stone upon that craggy hill,
<dt>Nor these sweet fields an herb or plant do bring,
<dt>Nor flower 'mongst all that do the valleys fill,
<dt>Nor any drop of water from the spring;
<p>
<dt>Nor beasts so wild, that in the woods do dwell,
<dt>But of my grief for Laura's death can tell.

<a name=160></a><h2>On the Death of Sylvia</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oh Death! without regard to wrong or right,
<dt>All things at will thy boundless rage devours;
<dt>This tender plant thou hast cut down in spight,
<dt>And scatter'd on the ground its fruit, and flowers.
<p>
<dt>Our love's extinct that with such ardour burn'd,
<dt>And all my hope of future pleasure dies;
<dt>Nature's chief master-piece to earth's return'd,
<dt>Deaf to my passion, and my grievous cries.
<p>
<dt>Sylvia, the tears which on thy sepulchre,
<dt>Hereafter shall be shed, or those now are,
<dt>Tho' fruitless, yet I offer them to thee,
<dt>Until the coming of th' Eternal Night
<dt>Shall close these eyes, once happy with thy sight,
<dt>And give me eyes with which I thee may see.

<dt>O Time! Oh rolling Heavens, that fly so fast,
<dt>And cheat us mortals ignorant and blind!
<dt>Oh fugitive Day, swifter than bird or wind!
<dt>Your frauds I see, by all my suff'rings past.
<p>
<dt>But pardon me, 'tis I myself must blame,
<dt>Nature that spreads your wings, and makes you fly,
<dt>To me gave eyes, that I my ills might spy:
<dt>Yet I retain'd them to my grief, and shame.
<p>
<dt>Time was I might, and Time is still I may
<dt>Direct my steps in a securer way,
<dt>And end this sad infinity of ill;
<dt>Yet 'tis not from thy yoke, O Love, I part,
<dt>But the effects; I will reclaim my heart:
<dt>Virtue's no chance, but is acquir'd by skill.

<p>
<dt>Vile Composition, Earth inspir'd with breath,

<dt>And then by law divine condemn'd to death;
<dt>When wilt thou check thy lusts in their careers?
<p>
<dt>Change all thy mirth to sorrow, and repent,
<dt>That thou so often didst just Heav'n offend,
<dt>Deplore thy precious hours so vainly spent,
<dt>If thou wilt 'scape such pains as have no end.
<p>
<dt>The gaping grave expects thee as its right,
<dt>'Tis a strait place, but can contain with ease,
<dt>Honour, Command, Wealth, Beauty, and Delight,
<dt>And all that does our carnal senses please.

<dt>Hope flatters, that I should my ends pursue,
<dt>And lends her right hand to my fainting heart.
<p>
<dt>My wretched heart accepts, nor yet espies

<dt>The sun I gaz'd so long at, I became

<dt>I chase a nimble doe that always flies,

<p>
<dt>Heartless I live to all things but my ill,
<dt>Which I'm solicitous to follow still;
<dt>And only call on Laura, Love and Death.
<p>

<dt>And thou, my heart, that dost my peace oppose,
<dt>Disloyal thou wilt give my soul no rest,
<dt>But harb'ring still these thoughts within my breast,
<dt>Keep'st correspondence with my deadly foes;
<p>
<dt>To thee Love all his messages conveys,
<dt>Fortune my now departed pomp displays,
<dt>Death in my mind does all my griefs express;
<p>
<dt>That my remains fall by necessity,
<dt>My thoughts with errors arm themselves in thee:
<dt>Thou art the cause of my unhappiness.

<p>
<dt>Why, Idol of my Heart, these mournful cries,
<dt>And so much grief on those fair cheeks appears?
<dt>From whence proceed those envious showers of tears,
<dt>Dark'ning the lustre of thy beauteous eyes?
<p>
<dt>How dares hold Sorrow labour to remove
<dt>So many graces from their proper place?
<dt>Ah, Cynthia! Pain endeavours, in thy face,
<dt>To poison all the sweetest charms of Love.
<p>
<dt>Sense of thy grief my soul with anguish fills,
<dt>Which out of pity into tears distills,
<dt>And for thy ease would fain endure thy woe!
<dt>But this affliction, sure thy heart sustains,
<dt>That, cruel Thou, being sensible of pains,
<dt>May'st to thy constant martyr pity show.

<p>
<dt>Near a cool fountain, on a rose-bed lay
<dt>My Cynthia, sleeping in the open air;
<dt>Whom Sol espied, and seeing her so fair,
<dt>Gaz'd, till his wanton coursers lost their way.
<p>
<dt>The proudest flowers were not asham'd to find
<dt>Their scent and colour rivall'd in her face;
<dt>Her bright curl'd hairs were toss'd from place to place,
<dt>On neck and bosom by the amorous wind.
<p>
<dt>Her smiles were animated by her breath,
<dt>Which still as soon as born receiv'd their death,
<dt>Being mortal made in pity to men's hearts:
<p>
<dt>Poor Lovers then did lie and take their rest,
<dt>For the Blind Boy who does our peace molest,
<dt>Had in her sleeping eyes hid all his darts.

<p>
<dt>I lov'd thee, faithless Man, and love thee still,
<dt>Thou fatal object of my fond desires,
<dt>And that which nourishes these amorous fires,
<dt>Is Hope, by which I love against my will.
<p>
<dt>Great was the passion thou didst late express,
<dt>Yet scorn'st me now, whom long thou didst adore,
<dt>Sporting with others, her thou mind'st no more,
<dt>Whom thou hast call'd thy Heav'n and happiness.
<p>
<dt>Think not by this, thy Lesbia thee invites,
<dt>To spend thy years in dalliance and delights,
<dt>'Tis but to keep her faith in memory;
<p>
<dt>But if to grieve my soul thou only strive,
<dt>To thy reproach, and to my boast I'll live,
<dt>A monument of thy INCONSTANCY.

<p>
<dt>With hairs, which for the wind to play with, hung,
<dt>With her torn garments, and with naked feet,
<dt>Fair Lydia dancing went from street to street,
<dt>Singing with pleasant voice her foolish song.
<p>
<dt>On her she drew all eyes in ev'ry place,
<dt>And them to pity by her pranks did move,
<dt>Which turn'd with gazing longer into Love
<dt>By the rare beauty of her charming face.
<p>
<dt>In all her frenzies, and her mimicries,
<dt>While she did Nature's richest gifts despise,
<dt>There active Love did subt'ly play his part.
<p>
<dt>Her antic postures made her look more gay,
<dt>Her ragged clothes her treasures did display,
<dt>And with each motion she ensnar'd a heart.

<p>
<dt>Unhappy I came from my Mother's womb,
<dt>As she, Oh blessed She! who gave me breath,
<dt>Having receiv'd the fatal stroke of Death,
<dt>By weeping friends was carried to her Tomb.
<p>
<dt>The sorrow I exprest, and grievous cries,
<dt>Love's tribute were, for her to Heav'n was gone,
<dt>My coffin, and my cradle, both were one,
<dt>And at her sunset, mine began to rise.
<p>
<dt>Wretch, how I quake to think on that sad day!
<dt>Which both for Life and Death at once made way;
<dt>Being gave the son, and mother turn'd to earth.
<p>
<dt>Alas, I die! Not that Life hastes so fast,
<dt>But that to me each minute seems the last,
<dt>For I, in Death's cold arms, receiv'd my Birth.

<p>
<dd>The Third Idyllium of Bion Englished, beginning, [greek]
<p>
<dt>I dreamt by me I saw fair Venus stand,
<dt>Holding young Cupid in her lovely hand,
<dt>And said, Kind Shepherd, I a Scholar bring,
<dt>My little son, to learn of you to sing.
<p>
<dt>Then went away; and I to gain her praise,
<dt>Would fain have taught him all my rural lays,
<dt>How Pan found out the Pipe, Pallas the Flute,
<dt>Phoebus the Harp, and Mercury the Lute.
<p>
<dt>These were my subjects, which he still would slight,
<dt>And fill my ears with Love-Songs, day and night;
<dt>Of mortals, and of Gods, what tricks they us'd,
<dt>And how his mother Venus them abus'd.
<p>
<dt>So I forgot my pupil to improve,
<dt>And learn'd of him, by songs, the Art of Love.

<p>
<dt>Chaste Cynthia bids me love, but hope no more,
<dt>Ne'er with enjoyment,--which I still have strove
<dt>T' obey, and ev'ry looser thought reprove;
<dt>Without desiring her, I her adore.
<dt>What human passion does with tears implore,
<dt>The intellect enjoys, when 'tis in love
<dt>With the eternal soul, which here does move
<dt>In mortal closet, where 'tis kept in store.
<p>
<dt>Our souls are in one mutual knot combin'd,
<dt>Not common passion, dull and unrefin'd;
<dt>Our flame ascends, that smothers here below:
<p>
<dt>The body made of earth, turns to the same,
<dt>As Soul t' Eternity, from whence it came;
<dt>My Love's immortal then, and mistress too.

<dt>Help! Help! Ye Nymphs, whilst on the neighb'ring plain
<dt>Your flocks do feed, come and assistance bring;
<dt>Alas! Fair Cynthia's sick and languishing,
<dt>For whom my heart endures a greater pain.
<p>
<dt>Ye Syrens of the Thames, let all your train
<dt>Tune their shrill Instruments, and to them sing,
<dt>And let its flow'ry banks with echoes ring,
<dt>This may her wonted cheerful looks regain.
<p>
<dt>Ye herbs, that richest med'cines can produce,
<dt>Come quickly and afford such sov'reign juice,
<dt>As from her heart may all the pains remove:
<p>
<dt>But in her face if death would paleness give,
<dt>And Fate ordain that she in torment live,
<dt>Then let her suffer in the flames of Love.

<p>
<dt>My hairs are hoary, wrinkled is my Face,
<dt>I lose my strength, and all my manly grace
<dt>My eyes grow dim, my teeth are broke or gone,
<dt>And the best part of all my life is done;
<p>
<dt>I'm drown'd in cares, and often sigh and weep;
<dt>My spirits fail me, broken is my sleep
<dt>Thoughts of the gaping grave distract my head;
<dt>For in its paths, 'wake or asleep, we tread;
<p>
<dt>None can from it by art their feet restrain
<dt>Nor back, tho' wide its gates, can come again.
<dt>Then since these ills attend the life of man,
<dt>Let's make their burden easy as we can.
<p>
<dt>Cares are no cares, but whilst on them we think,
<dt>To clear our minds of such dull thoughts, let's drink.

<p>
<dt>Led by kind stars one ev'ning to the grove,
<dt>I spied my Cynthia in the Walk of Love;
<dt>Her heav'nly voice did soon salute my ears,
<dt>I heard, methought, the Music of the Spheres.
<p>
<dt>Those notes on all the birds had laid a spell,
<dt>And list'ning 'mongst the rest was Philomel;
<dt>Who thinking she, in credit, suffer'd wrong,
<dt>Strove, tho' in vain, to equal Cynthia's song
<p>
<dt>But when herself, in voice, outdone she knew,
<dt>Being griev'd, she ceas'd, and from her rival flew,
<dt>I stay'd and saw my fair walk round the tree,
<dt>And sing her triumph for the victory.
<p>
<dt>Thus whilst my ears were feasted with delight,
<dt>My eyes no less were charm'd at her angelic sight.

<dt>Why dost thou fly me thus? Oh cruel boy!
<dt>I am no wolf that would thy life destroy:
<dt>But a fond Nymph, admirer of thy face,
<dt>As Echo once of fair Narcissus was.
<p>
<dt>Thou e'en in dangers dost thy fancy please,
<dt>Striving with toil the hunted game to seize:
<dt>While wretched me, who languish for thy sake,
<dt>When in thy net thou dost refuse to take.
<p>
<dt>But I, alas, in vain attempt to find
<dt>Effects of pity in a hard'ned mind:
<dt>As soon the hare its hunters may pursue,
<dt>As I with prayers thy cruel heart subdue.
<p>
<dt>My pow'r, I see, cannot thy steps retain,
<dt>Thus led by sports, and wing'd by thy disdain.

<p>
<dt>The life we strive to lengthen out,
<dt>Is like a feather rais'd from ground,
<dt>Awhile in air 'tis tost about,
<dt>And almost lost as soon as found;
<p>
<dt>If it continue long in sight,
<dt>'Tis sometimes high and sometimes low,
<dt>Yet proudly aims a tow'ring flight,
<dt>To make the more conspicuous show.
<p>
<dt>The air with ease its weight sustains,
<dt>Since 'tis by Nature light, and frail;
<dt>Seldom in quiet state remains,
<dt>For troops of dangers it assail.
<p>
<dt>And after various conflicts with its foes,
<dt>It drops to Earth, the Earth from whence it rose.

<p>
<dd>Simonides, [greek]. Beginning, [greek]
<p>
<dt>No human thing in constancy will stay;
<dt>The learned Chian us'd of old to say,
<dt>Our life was frailer than the fading leaves;
<dt>Which Man forgets, and scarce its flight perceives
<p>
<dt>He harbours idle fancies in his brain,
<dt>Many which he from childhood did retain:
<dt>And whilst his vigour lasts, he's still inclin'd
<dt>To fill with trifles his unsettled mind;
<p>
<dt>On Age or Death ne'er thinks, nor takes he care
<dt>Health to preserve, or active limbs to spare.
<dt>We to more serious things our minds should give;
<dt>Youth hastes, and we have little time to live.
<p>
<dt>To weigh this well, is a material part,
<dt>This thought's of worth, record it in thy heart.

<p>
<dt>See, whilst thou weep'st, fair Chloe, see
<dt>The world in sympathy with thee.
<dt>The cheerful birds no longer sing;
<dt>Each drops his head and hangs his wing:
<dt>The clouds have bent their bosom lower,
<dt>And shed their sorrows in a shower;
<dt>The brooks beyond their limits flow,
<dt>And louder murmurs speak their woe:
<dt>The nymphs and swains adopt thy cares:
<dt>They heave thy sighs and weep thy tears,
<dt>Fantastic nymph! that Grief should move
<dt>Thy heart obdurate against Love.
<dt>Strange tears whose power can soften all
<dt>But that dear breast on which they fall.
