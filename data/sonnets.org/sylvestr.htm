<p>
<dt>Were I as base as is the lowly plain,
<dt>And you, my Love, as high as heaven above,
<dt>Yet should the thoughts of me, your humble swain,
<dt>Ascend to heaven in honor of my love.
<dt>Were I as high as heaven above plain,
<dt>And you, my Love, as humble and as low
<dt>As are the deepest bottoms of the main,
<dt>Wheresoe'er you were, with you my love shouuld go.
<dt>Were you the earth, dear Love, and I the skies,
<dt>My love should shine on you like to the sun,
<dt>And look upon you with ten thousand eyes
<dt>Till heaven waxed blind, and till the world were dun.
<dt>Wheresoe'er I am, below, or else above you,
<dt>Wheresoe'er you are, my heart shall truly love you.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>"They say that shadows of deceased ghosts"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>They say that shadows of deceased ghosts
<dt>Do haunt the houses and the graves about,
<dt>Of such whose life's lamp went untimely out,
<dt>Delighting still in their forsaken hosts:
<dt>So, in the place where cruel Love doth shoot
<dt>The fatal shaft that slew my love's delight,
<dt>I stalk, and walk, and wander day and night,
<dt>Even like a ghost with unperceived foot.
<dt>But those light ghosts are happier far than I,
<dt>For, at their pleasure, they can come and go
<dt>Unto the place that hides their treasure so,
<dt>And see the name with their fantastic eye:
<dt>Where I, alas, dare not approach the cruel
<dt>Proud moment that doth enclose my jewel.
