<p>
<dt>Once, by the dusk light of an ancient hall
<dt>I saw a horologe. Its minutes fell
<dt>Upon the roused ear, with a drowsy knell
<dt>That he who passed attended to the call.
<dt>I looked: and lo! five antics over all.
<dt>One moved, and four were motionless. The one
<dt>Was scythed and bald-head Time; and he mowed on,
<dt>Sweep after sweep--and each a minute's fall.
<p>
<dt>The four were kings. Sceptres they bore and globes
<dt>And ermined crowns. Before that old man dim
<dt>They stood, but not in joy. At sight of Time
<dt>They had stiffened into statues in their robes,
<dt>Fear-petrified.  Let no man envy him
<dt>Who smiles at that grave homily sublime!

<p>
<dt>Go, take thine angle, and with practised line,
<dt>Light as the gossamer, the current sweep;
<dt>And if thou failest in teh calm still deep,
<dt>In the rough eddy may the prize be thine.
<dt>Say thou'rt unlucky where the sunbeams shine;
<dt>Beneath teh shadow, where the waters creep,
<dt>Perchance the monarch of the brook shall leap--
<dt>For fate is ever better than design.
<p>
<dt>Still persevere; the giddiest breeze that blows,
<dt>For thee may blow with fame and fortune rife;
<dt>Be prosperous--and what reck if it arose
<dt>Out of some pebble with the stream at strife;
<dt>Or that the light wind dallied with the boughs?
<dt>Thou art successful;--such is human life.
