<a name=100></a><h2>The Columbine</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Still, still my eye will gaze long fixed on thee,
<dt>Till I forget that I am called a man,
<dt>And at thy side fast-rooted seem to be,
<dt>And the breeze comes my cheek with thine to fan.
<dt>Upon this craggy hill our life shall pass,
<dt>A life of summer days and summer joys,
<dt>Nodding our honey-bells mid pliant grass
<dt>In which the bee half hid his time employs;
<dt>And here we'll drink with thirsty pores the rain,
<dt>And turn dew-sprinkled to the rising sun,
<dt>And look when in the flaming west again
<dt>His orb across the heaven its path has run;
<dt>Here left in darkness on the rocky steep,
<dt>My weary eyes shall close like folding flowers in sleep.
</p>
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>The Fair Morning</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The clear bright morning, with its scented air
<dt>And gaily waving flowers, is here again;
<dt>Man's heart is lifted with the voice of prayer,
<dt>And peace descends, as falls the gentle rain;
<dt>The tuneful birds, that all the night have slept,
<dt>Take up at dawn the evening's dying lay,
<dt>When sleep upon their eyelids gently crept
<dt>And stole with stealthy craft their song away.
<dt>High overhead the forest's swaying boughs
<dt>Sprinkle with drops the traveler on his way;
<dt>He hears far off the tinkling bells of cows
<dt>Driven to pasture at the break of day;
<dt>With vigorous step he passes swift along,
<dt>Making the woods reecho with his song.
</p>
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>The Clouded Morning</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The morning comes, and thickening clouds prevail,
<dt>Hanging like curtains all the horizon round,
<dt>Or overhead in heavy stillness sail;
<dt>So still is day, it seems like night profound;
<dt>Scarce by the city's din the air is stirred,
<dt>And dull and deadened comes its every sound;
<dt>The cock's shrill, piercing voice subdued is heard,
<dt>By the thick folds of muffling vapors drowned.
<dt>Dissolved in mists the hills and trees appear,
<dt>Their outlines lost and blended with the sky;
<dt>And well-known objects, that to all are near,
<dt>No longer seem familiar to the eye,
<dt>But with fantastic forms they mock the sight, 
<dt>As when we grope amid the gloom of night.
</p>
<p>
<a name=400></a><h2>Nature</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The bubbling brook doth leap when I come by,
<dt>Because my feet find measure with its call;
<dt>The birds know when the friend they love is nigh,
<dt>For I am known to them, both great and small.
<dt>The flower that on the lonely hillside grows
<dt>Expects me there when spring its bloom has given;
<dt>And many a tree and bush my wanderings knows,
<dt>And e'en the clouds and silent stars of heaven;
<dt>For he who with his Maker walks aright,
<dt>Shall be their lord as Adam was before;
<dt>His ear shall catch each sound with new delight,
<dt>Each object wear the dress that then it wore;
<dt>And he, as when erect in soul he stood,
<dt>Hear from his Father's lips that all is good.
</p>
<p>
<a name=500></a><h2>The Garden</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I saw the spot where our first parents dwelt;
<dt>And yet it wore to me no face of change,
<dt>For while amid its fields and groves I felt
<dt>As if I had not sinned, nor thought it strange;
<dt>My eye seemed but a part of every sight,
<dt>My ear heard music in each sound that rose,
<dt>Each sense forever found a new delight,
<dt>Such as the spirit's vision only knows;
<dt>Each act some new and ever-varying joy
<dt>Did by my Father's love for me prepare;
<dt>To dress the spot my ever fresh employ,
<dt>And in the glorious whole with Him to share;
<dt>No more without the flaming gate to stray,
<dt>No more for sin's dark stain the debt of death to pay.
</p>
<p>
<a name=600></a><h2>The Song</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When I would sing of crooked streams and fields,
<dt>On, on from me they stretch too far and wide,
<dt>And at their look my song all powerless yields,
<dt>And down the river bears me with its tide;
<dt>Amid the fields I am a child again,
<dt>The spots that then I loved I love the more,
<dt>My fingers drop the strangely scrawling pen,
<dt>And I remember nought but nature's lore,
<dt>I plunge me in the river's cooling wave,
<dt>Or on the embroidered bank admiring lean,
<dt>Now some endangered insect life to save,
<dt>Now watch the pictured flowers and grasses green;
<dt>Forever playing where a boy I played,
<dt>By hill and grove, by field and stream delayed.
</p>
<p>
<a name=700></a><h2>The Dead</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I see them crowd on crowd they walk the earth
<dt>Dry, leafless trees no Autumn wind laid bare,
<dt>And in their nakedness find cause for mirth,
<dt>And all unclad would winter's rudeness dare;
<dt>No sap doth through their clattering branches flow,
<dt>Whence springing leaves and blossoms bright appear;
<dt>Their hearts the living God have ceased to know,
<dt>Who gives the spring time to th'expectant year;
<dt>They mimic life, as if from him to steal
<dt>His glow of health to paint the livid cheek;
<dt>They borrow words for thoughts they cannot feel,
<dt>That with a seeming heart their tongue may speak;
<dt>And in their show of life more dead they live
<dt>Than those that to the earth with many tears they give.
