<p>
<dt>No moon now blushes on the enamoured sight;
<dt>No genial sun now warms the torpid lay
<dt>Since February sternly checked his ray
<dt>When Lucy's eyes first beamed their azure light.
<dt>What though no vernal flowers my hand invite
<dt>To crop their fragrance for your natal day;
<dt>Lucy, for you the snowdrop and the bay
<dt>Shall blend the unfading green and modest white.
<p>
<dt>Though on your natal day with aspect bleak
<dt>Stern winter frown, in icy garments dressed,
<dt>Still may the rosy summer robe your cheek
<dt>And the green spring still bud within your breast:
<dt>Till, the world fading on your closing eyes,
<dt>You find a golden autumn in the skies.
