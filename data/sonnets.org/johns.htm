<p>
<dt>Soul of the far but unforgotten past!
<dt>Queen of the sword and lady of the lyre!
<dt>Spirit of thoughts too high, of deeds too vast,
<dt>To fear, like clay, the waste of flood and fire,
<dt>Or darkly perish on oblivion's pyre--
<dt>Whence, like the birds from Memnon's pile, they spring
<dt>Born from the dust, but not with years to tire,
<dt>Or furl in death the everlasting wing!
<p>
<dt>Teach me, Oh! teach me, but for once to fling
<dt>My hand thy own triumphal harp along--
<dt>To strike one strain whose echoes yet may ring
<dt>Above the spot where rests a friend of song!--
<dt>Do I but dream the laurel yet may wave
<dt>Memorial verdure over its votary's grave?
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Wood-storm</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When to the winds the firm oak's stately form
<dt>Sways, while each branch is as an organ-key
<dt>Dashed to mad music by the frantic storm,
<dt>And swells the full tremendous melody,
<dt>I love amid the sounding woods to be
<dt>And with a stern and solemn rapture hear
<dt>The straining forest's thunder--it is to me
<dt>An hour of awful bliss and glorious fear!--
<p>
<dt>But wilder, stranger still, swells on the ear
<dt>That shrill sound heard amid the tempest's pause,
<dt>As it were a phantom's whisper, deep yet clear,
<dt>While its dread breath anew the spent blast draws.
<dt>Sounds not that voice, which makes the listener pale,
<dt>Like some lone forest-spirit's desolate wail?
