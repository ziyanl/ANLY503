Alcott Network</a>      .
<p>"The son of&nbsp;a farmer in Wolcott, Conn., he pursued 
his calling as a schoolmaster, traveled through the South,&nbsp;taught 
children's schools in Boston, and reached the culmination of his pedagogic 
career in the Concord Summer School of Philosophy.&nbsp; He is most widely known 
as the intimate friend and neighbor of Emerson, and as the father of Louisa M. 
Alcott, author of <em>Little Women</em>.&nbsp; <em>Sonnets and 
Canzonets</em>

<dl>
  <dt>Who nearer Nature's life would truly come 
  <dt>Must nearer come to him of whom I speak: 
  <dt>He all kinds knew,--the vocal and the dumb; 
  <dt>Masterful in genius was he and unique, 
  <dt>Patient, sagacious, tender, frolicsome. 
  <dt>This Concord Pan would oft his whistle take, 
  <dt>And forth from wood and fen, field, hill, and lake, 
  <dt>   Trooping around him in their several guise, 
  <dt>      &nbsp; 
  <dt>
  <dt>The shy inhabitants their haunts forsake; 
  <dt>Then he, like Æsop, man would satirize, 
  <dt>Hold up the image wild to clearest view 
  <dt>Of undiscerning manhood's puzzled eyes, 
  <dt>And mocking say, "Lo!&nbsp; mirrors here for you: 
  <dt>Be true as these if ye would be more wise."</dt></dl>
<h2><a name="mrs" alcott></a>To Mrs. Alcott</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Mean are all titles of nobility, 
  <dt>And kins poor spendthrifts while I do compare 
  <dt>The wealth she daily lavishes on me 
  <dt>Of love, the noble kingdom that I share: 
  <dt>Is it the jealous year, for emphasis, 
  <dt>Sheds beauteous sunshine and refreshing dews? 
  <dt>My maiden's mouth doth softlier court and kiss, 
  <dt> Tint springtime's virgin cheek with rosier hues. 
  <dt>      &nbsp; 
  <dt>
  <dt>Fly faster o'er my page, impassioned quill, 
  <dt>Signing this note of mine with tenderer touch! 
  <dt>Say I no measure find to mete my will, 
  <dt>Say that I love, but cannot tell how much; 
  <dt>Let time and trouble the full story tell: 
  <dt>I cannot love thee more.&nbsp; I know I love thee well.</dt></dl>
<h2><a name="lma"></a>To L. M. A.</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>When I remember with what buoyant heart, 
  <dt>Midst war's alarms and woes of civil strife, 
  <dt>In youthful eagerness thou didst depart, 
  <dt>At peril of thy safety, peace, and life, 
  <dt>To nurse the wounded soldier, swathe the dead,-- 
  <dt>How piercèd soon by fever's poisoned dart, 
  <dt>And brought unconscious home, with 'wildered head,-- 
  <dt>Though ever since, mid languor and dull pain, 
  <dt>       &nbsp; 
  <dt>
  <dt>To conquer fortune, cherish kindred dear, 
  <dt>Hast with grave studies vexed a sprightly brain, 
  <dt>In myriad households kindled love and cheer; 
  <dt>Ne'er from thyself by Fame's lound trump beguiled, 
  <dt>Sounding in this and the farther hemisphere,-- 
  <dt>I press thee to my heart as Duty's faithful child.</dt></dl>
<h2><a name="read"></a>Read at Emerson's Funeral</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>His harp is silent; shall successors rise, 
  <dt>Touching with venturous hand the trembling string, 
  <dt>Kindle glad raptures, visions of surprise, 
  <dt>And wake to ecstasy each slumbering thing? 
  <dt>Shall life and thought flash new in wondering eyes, 
  <dt>As when the seer transcendant, sweet and wise, 
  <dt>World-wide his native melodies did sing, 
  <dt>Flushed with fair hopes and ancient memories? 
  <dt>      &nbsp; 
  <dt>
  <dt>Ah no: that matchless lyre shall silent lie; 
  <dt>None hath the vanished minstrel's wondrous skill 
  <dt>To touch that instrument with art and will, 
  <dt>With him winged Poesy doth droop and die; 
  <dt>While our dull age, left voiceless, must lament 
  <dt>The bard high Heaven had for its service sent.</dt></dl>
