<p>
<dt>Here, from earth's d&aelig;dal heights and dingles lowly,
<dt>The representatives of nature meet;
<dt>Not like a congress or alliance holy
<dt>Of kings, to rivet chains, but with their sweet
<dt>Blossomy mouths to preach the love complete,
<dt>That with pearled mistletoe and beaded holly
<dt>Clothed them in green unchangeable, to greet
<dt>Winter with smiles and banish melancholy.
<p>
<dt>l envy not the Emathian madman's fame,
<dt>Who won the world and built immortal shame
<dt>On tears and blood; but if some flower, new-found,
<dt>In its embalming cup might shroud my name,
<dt>Mine were a tomb more worthily renowned
<dt>Than Cheops' pile or Artemisia's mound.
