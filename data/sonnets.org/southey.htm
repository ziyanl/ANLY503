<a name=100></a><h2>Winter</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>A wrinkled crabbed man they picture thee,
<dt>Old Winter, with a rugged beard as grey
<dt>As the long moss upon the apple-tree;
<dt>Blue-lipt, an icedrop at thy sharp blue nose,
<dt>Close muffled up, and on thy dreary way
<dt>Plodding alone through sleet and drifting snows.
<dt>They should have drawn thee by the high-heapt hearth,
<dt>Old Winter! seated in thy great armed chair,
<dt>Watching the children at their Christmas mirth;
<dt>Or circled by them as thy lips declare
<dt>Some merry jest, or tale of murder dire,
<dt>Or troubled spirit that disturbs the night,
<dt>Pausing at times to rouse the mouldering fire,
<dt>Or taste the old <a href="#999">October</a> brown and bright.
</P>
<a name=200></a><h2>"Go, Valentine..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Go, Valentine, and tell that lovely maid
<dt>Whom fancy still will portray to my sight,
<dt>How here I linger in this sullen shade,
<dt>This dreary gloom of dull monastic night;
<dt>Say, that every joy of life remote
<dt>At evening's closing hour I quit the throng,
<dt>Listening in solitude the ring-dome's note,
<dt>Who pours like me her solitary song;
<dt>Say, that of her absence calls the sorrowing sigh;
<dt>Say, that of all her charms I love to speak,
<dt>In fancy feel the magic of her eye,
<dt>In fancy view the smile illume her cheek,
<dt>Court the lone hour when silence stills the grove,
<dt>And heave the sigh of memory and of love.
</P>

<a name=210></a><h2>To a Goose</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If thou didst feed on western plains of yore
<dt>Or waddle wide with flat and flabby feet
<dt>Over some Cambrian mountain's plashy moor,
<dt>Or find in farmer's yard a safe retreat
<dt>From gipsy thieves and foxes sly and fleet;
<dt>If thy grey quills by lawyer guided, trace
<dt>Deeds big with ruin to some wretched race,
<dt>Or love-sick poet's sonnet, sad and sweet,
<dt>Wailing the rigour of some lady fair;
<dt>Or if, the drudge of housemaid's daily toil,
<dt>Cobwebs and dust thy pinion white besoil,
<dt>Departed goose! I neither know nor care.
<dt>But this I know, that thou wert very fine,
<dt>Seasoned with sage and onions and port wine.
<p>
<a name=230></a><h2>Ariste</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Let ancient stories round the painter's art,
<dt>Who stole from many a maid his Venus' charms,
<dt>Till warm devotion fired each gazer's heart
<dt>And every bosom bounded with alarms.
<dt>He culled the beauties of his native isle,
<dt>From some the blush of beauty's vermeil dyes,
<dt>From some the lovely look, the winning smile,
<dt>From some the languid lustre of the eyes.
<p>
<dt>Low to the finished form the nations round
<dt>In adoration bent the pious knee;
<dt>With myrtle wreaths the artist's brow they crowned,
<dt>Whose skill, Ariste, only imaged thee.
<dt>Ill-fated artist, doomed so wide to seek
<dt>The charms that blossom on Ariste's cheek!
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>"Hold your mad hands..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="slave.gif">
<P>
<dt>Hold your mad hands! for ever on your plain
<dt>Must the gorged vulture clog his beak with blood?
<dt>For ever must your Niger's tainted flood,
<dt>Roll to the ravenous shark his banquet slain?
<dt>Hold your mad hands! and learn at length to know,
<dt>And turn your vengeance on the common foe,
<dt>Yon treacherous vessel and her godless crew!
<dt>Let never traders with false pretext fair
<dt>Set on your shores again their wicked feet:
<dt>With interdict and indignation meet
<dt>Repel them, and with fire and sword pursue!
<dt>Avarice, the white cadaverous fiend, is there,
<dt>Who spreads his toils accursed wide and far,
<dt>And for his purveyor calls the demon War.
</P>
<a name=400></a><h2>"High in the air exposed..."</h2>
<P>
<dt>High in the air exposed the slave is hung,
<dt>To all the birds of heaven, their living food!
<dt>He groans not, though awaked by that fierce sun
<dt>New torturers live to drink their parent blood;
<dt>He groans not, though the gorging vulture tear
<dt>The quivering fiber. Hither look, O ye
<dt>Who tore this man from peace and liberty!
<dt>Look hither, ye who weigh with politic care
<dt>The gain against the guilt! Beyond the grave
<dt>There is another world: bear ye in mind,
<dt>Ere your decree proclaims to all mankind
<dt>The gain is worth the guilt, that there the Slave,
<dt>Before the Eternal, "thunder-tongued shall plead
<dt>Against the deep damnation of your deed.
</P>
