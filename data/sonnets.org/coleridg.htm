<a name=100></a><h2>Work without Hope</h2>
<P>
<dt>All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair--
<dt>The bees are stirring--birds are on the wing--
<dt>And Winter slumbering in the open air,
<dt>Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!
<dt>And I the while, the sole unbusy thing,
<dt>Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.
<p>
<dt>Yet, well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,
<dt>Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.
<dt>Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,
<dt>For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!
<dt>With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll:
<dt>And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul?
<dt>Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,
<dt>And hope without an object cannot live.
</P>

<a name=200></a><h2>On a Discovery Made Too Late</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Thou bleedest, my poor Heart! and thy distress
<dt>Reasoning I ponder with a scornful smile
<dt>And probe thy sore wound sternly, though the while
<dt>Swoln be mine eye and dim with heaviness.
<dt>Why didst thou listen to Hope's whisper bland?
<dt>Or, listening, why forget the healing tale,
<dt>When Jealousy with feverous fancies pale
<dt>Jarr'd thy fine fibres with a maniac's hand?
<dt>Faint was that Hope, and rayless!--Yet 'twas fair
<dt>And sooth'd with many a dream the hour of rest:
<dt>Thou should'st have lov'd it most, when most opprest,
<dt>And nurs'd it with an agony of care,
<dt>Even as a mother her sweet infant heir
<dt>That wan and sickly droops upon her breast!
</P>
