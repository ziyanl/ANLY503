Judged by my goddess' doom to endless pain,
<dt>
Lo, here I ope my sorrow's passion,
<dt>
That every silly eye may view most plain
<dt>
A sentence given on no occasion.
<dt>
If that by chance they fall (most fortunate)
<dt>
Within those cruel hands that did enact it,
<dt>
Say but, Alas, he was too passionate,
<dt>
My doom is passed, nor can be now unactit.
<dt>
So mayst thou see I was a spotless lover,
<dt>
And grieve withal that e'er thou dealt so sore;
<dt>
Unto remorse who goes about to move her
<dt>
Pursues the wing&eacute;d winds, and tills the shore.
<dt>
Lovely is her semblance, hard is her heart,
<dt>
Wavering is her mind, sure is her dart.

<dt>
Relent, my dear yet unkind Coelia,
<dt>
At length relent, and give my sorrows end.
<dt>
So shall I keep my long-wished holiday,
<dt>
And set a trophy on a froward friend.
<dt>
Nor tributes, nor imposts, nor other duties
<dt>
Demand I will, as lawful conqueror;
<dt>
Duties, tributes, imposts unto thy beauties
<dt>
Myself will pay as yielded servitor.
<dt>
Then quick relent, thyself surrender us.
<dt>
Brave sir, and why (quoth she) must I relent?
<dt>
Relent (cried I), thyself doth conquer us.
<dt>
When eftsoons with my proper instrument
<dt>
She cut me off, ay me, and answer&eacute;d,
<dt>
You cannot conquer, and be conquer&eacute;d.

<P>
<dt>
It shall be said I died for Coelia;
<dt>
Then quick, thou grisly man of Erebus,
<dt>
Transport me hence unto Proserpina,
<dt>
To be adjudged as--wilful amorous;
<dt>
To be hung up within the liquid air,
<dt>
For all the sighs which I in vain have wasted;
<dt>
To be through Lethe's waters cleans&eacute;d fair,
<dt>
For those dark clouds which have my looks o'ercasted;
<dt>
To be condemned to everlasting fire,
<dt>
Because at Cupid's fire I wilful brent me;
<dt>
And to be clad for deadly dumps in mire.
<dt>
Among so many plagues which shall torment me
<dt>
One solace I shall find, when I am over,--
<dt>
It will be known I died a constant lover.
