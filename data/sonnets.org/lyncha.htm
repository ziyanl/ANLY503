<p>
<dt>The planted seed consigned to common earth,
<dt>Disdains to moulder with the baser clay;
<dt>But rises up to meet the light of day,
<dt>Spreads all its leaves, and flowers, and tendrils forth;
<dt>And, bathed and ripened in the genial ray,
<dt>Pours out its perfume on the wandering gales,
<dt>Till in that fragrant breath its life exhales.
<dt>So this immortal germ within my breast
<dt>Would strive to pierce the dull, dark clod of sense,
<dt>With aspirations wingéd and intense;
<dt>Would so stretch upward, in its tireless quest,
<dt>To meet the Central Soul, its source, its rest;
<dt>So in the fragrance of the immortal flower,
<dt>High thoughts and noble deeds, its life it would outpour.
<p>
<a name="002"></a><h2>On Seeing the Ivory Statue of Christ</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>The enthusiast brooding in his cell apart
<dt>O'er the sad image of the Crucified,--
<dt>The drooping head, closed lips and piercéd side,--
<dt>A holy vision fills his raptured heart;
<dt>With heavenly power inspired, his unskilled arm
<dt>Shapes the rude block to this transcendent form.
<dt>Oh Son of God! thus, ever thus, would I
<dt>Dwell on the loveliness enshrined in Thee;
<dt>The lofty faith, the sweet humility;
<dt>The boundless love, the love that could not die.
<dt>And as the sculptor, with thy glory warm,
<dt>Gave to this chiselled ivory thy fair form,
<dt>So would my spirit, in thy thought divine,
<dt>Grow to a semblance, fair as this, of Thine.
<p>
<a name="003"></a><h2>Faith</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Securely cabined in the ship below,
<dt>Through darkness and through storm I cross the sea,
<dt>A pathless wilderness of waves to me:
<dt>But yet I do not fear, because I know
<dt>That he who guides the good ship o'er that waste
<dt>Sees in the stars her shining pathway traced.
<dt>Blindfold I walk this life's bewildering maze;
<dt>Up flinty steep, through frozen mountain pass,
<dt>Through thornset barren and through deep morass:
<dt>But strong in faith I tread the uneven ways,
<dt>And bare my head unshrinking to the blast,
<dt>Because my Father's arm is round me cast;
<dt>And if the way seems rough, I only clasp
<dt>The hand that leads me with a firmer grasp.
<p>
<a name="004"></a><h2>On a Picture of the Virgin</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>If the young mother clasp, for the first time,
<dt>The mortal child that earthly love has given,
<dt>With a deep joy preluding that of heaven;
<dt>Who shall describe thy ecstacy sublime,
<dt>Oh Virgin mother! when upon thy ear
<dt>The message of the announcing angel fell,
<dt>In heavenly tones to calm thy rising fear,
<dt>And thy approaching glory to fortell.
<dt>Was ever mother so divinely blest,
<dt>As when, the glow of Heaven yet clinging round him,
<dt>Before the weight of human grief had bound him,
<dt>The gentle Christ-child to thy heart was prest?
<dt>Oh, blessed among women! joy like thine
<dt>What hand shall dare describe! alas, not mine.
<p>
<a name="005"></a><h2>"Oh! in that better land to which I go"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Oh! in that better land to which I go,
<dt>Say, shall I know thee as I know thee here;
<dt>And will thy presence dim that glorious sphere,
<dt>As it hath darkened all the earth below?
<dt>Oh! will that voice enchain my listening ear,
<dt>Whose "frozen music" stops my pulses now;
<dt>And shall I meet in that fair land of bliss
<dt>Those calm, cold eyes that chill me so in this?
<dt>Shall I bear hence e'en <i>memory</i> of thee?
<dt>Unheeded then will pass the Angel throngs;
<dt>I shall not hear the Seraph's burning songs,
<dt>And heaven itself will be all dark to me.
<dt>Oh give me rather that drear, hopeless faith,
<dt>That sees no morn beyond the night of death!
<p>
<a name="006"></a><h2>The Bee</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>The honey-bee that wanders all day long,
<dt>The field, the woodland, and the garden o'er,
<dt>To gather in his fragrant winter store,
<dt>Humming in calm content his quiet song,
<dt>Seeks not alone the rose's glowing breast,
<dt>The lily's dainty cup, the violet's lips,--
<dt>But from all rank and noxious weeds he sips
<dt>The single drop of sweetness closely press'd
<dt>Within the poison chalice. Thus, if we
<dt>Seek only to draw forth the hidden sweet,
<dt>In all the varied human flowers we meet,
<dt>In the wide garden of humanity,
<dt>And like the bee, if home the spoil we bear,
<dt>Hived in our hearts it turns to nectar there.
<p>
<a name="007"></a><h2>"Oh thou who once on earth, beneath the weight"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Oh thou who once on earth, beneath the weight
<dt>Of our mortality didst live and move,
<dt>The incarnation of profoundest love;
<dt>Who on the Cross that love didst consummate;
<dt>Whose deep and ample fullness could embrace
<dt>The poorest, meanest of our fallen race:
<dt>How shall we e'er that boundless debt repay?
<dt>By long loud prayers in gorgeous temples said?
<dt>By rich oblations on thine altars laid?
<dt>Ah, no! not thus thou didst appoint the way:
<dt>When thou wast bowed our human woe beneath,
<dt>Then as a legacy thou didst bequeath
<dt>Earth's sorrowing children to our ministry--
<dt>And as we do to them, we do to thee.
<p>
<a name="008"></a><h2>Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Go forth in life, oh friend! not seeking love;
<dt>A mendicant, that with imploring eye
<dt>And outstretched hand asks of the passers by
<dt>The alms his strong necessities may move.
<dt>For such poor love to pity near allied,
<dt>Thy generous spirit may not stoop and wait,
<dt>A suppliant, whose prayer may be denied,
<dt>Like a spurned beggar's at a palace gate:
<dt>But thy heart's affluence lavish uncontrolled;
<dt>The largess of thy love give full and free,
<dt>As monarchs in their progress scatter gold;
<dt>And be thy heart like the exhaustless sea,
<dt>That must its wealth of cloud and dew bestow,
<dt>Though tributary streams or ebb or flow.
<p>
<a name="009"></a><h2>The Sun and Stream</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>As some dark stream within a cavern's breast,
<dt>Flows murmuring, moaning for the distant sun,
<dt>So ere I met thee, murmuring its unrest,
<dt>Did my life's current coldly, darkly run.
<dt>And as that stream, beneath the sun's full gaze,
<dt>Its separate course and life no more maintains,
<dt>But now absorbed, transfused far o'er the plains,
<dt>It floats, etherealized in those warm rays;
<dt>So in the sunlight of thy fervid love,
<dt>My heart, so long to earth's dark channels given,
<dt>Now soars, all pain, all doubt, all ill above,
<dt>And breathes the ether of the upper heaven:
<dt>So thy high spirit holds and governs mine;
<dt>So is my life, my being, lost in thine!
<p>
<a name="010"></a><h2>TO ________</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Ah no! my love knows no vain jealousy:
<dt>The rose that blooms and lives but in the sun,
<dt>Asks not what other flowers he shines upon,
<dt>If he but shine on her. Enough for me,
<dt>Thus in thy light to dwell, and thus to share
<dt>The sunshine of thy smile with all things fair.
<dt>I know thou'rt vowed to Beauty, not to Love.
<dt>I would not stay thy footsteps from one shrine,
<dt>Nor would I bind thee by a sigh to mine.
<dt>For me--I have no lingering wish to rove;
<dt>For though I worship all things fair, like thee,
<dt>Of outward grace, of soul-nobility;
<dt>Happier than thou, I find them all in one,
<dt>And I would worship at thy shrine alone!
<p>
<a name="011"></a><h2>The Lake and Star</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>The mountain lake, o'ershadowed by the hills,
<dt>May still gaze heavenward on the evening star,
<dt>Whose distant light its dark recesses fills,
<dt>Though boundless distance must divide them far;
<dt>Still may the lake the star's bright image bear,
<dt>Still may the star, from its blue ether dome,
<dt>Shower down its silver beams across the gloom,
<dt>And light the wave that wanders darkly there.
<dt>Star of my life! thus do I turn to thee
<dt>Amid the shadows that above me roll;
<dt>Thus from thy distant sphere thou shinest on me;
<dt>Thus does thine image float upon my soul,
<dt>Through the wide space that must our lives dissever
<dt>Far as the lake and star, ah me! forever.
<p>
<a name="012"></a><h2>A Remembrance</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Night closes round me, and wild threatening forms
<dt>Clasp me with icy arms and chain me down,
<dt>And bind upon my brow a cypress crown,
<dt>Dewy with tears, and heaven frowns dark with storms;
<dt>But the one glorious memory of thee
<dt>Rises upon my path to guide and bless,
<dt>The bright SHEKINAH of the wilderness,
<dt>The Polar Star upon a trackless sea,
<dt>The beaming Pharos of the unreached shore.
<dt>It spans the clouds that gather o'er my way,
<dt>The rainbow of my life's tempestuous day.
<dt>Oh, blessed thought! stay with me evermore,
<dt>And shed thy lustrous beams where midnight glooms,
<dt>As fragrant lamps burned in the ancient tombs.
<p>
<a name="013"></a><h2>Tarpeia</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>"Give me the bracelets that your warriors wear,"
<dt>The Roman traitress to the Sabine cried,
<dt>"Give me the toys, and I will be your guide,
<dt>And to your host the city's gates unbar."
<dt>Then to the walls each eager warrior rushed,
<dt>And on the base Tarpeia as he passed,
<dt>Each from his arm the massive circlet cast,
<dt>Till her slight form beneath the weight was crushed.
<dt>Thus are our idle wishes. Thus we sigh
<dt>For some imagined good yet unattained;--
<dt>For wealth, or fame, or love, and which once gained
<dt>May like a curse o'er all our future lie.
<dt>Thus in our blindness do we ask of fate,
<dt>The gifts that once bestowed may crush us with their weight.
<p>
<a name="014"></a><h2>Milton</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Oh bard! what though upon thy mortal eyes
<dt>There fell no glimmering ray of earthly light,
<dt>And the deep shadow of eternal night
<dt>Shut from thy gaze our lovely earth and skies,
<dt>Yet was it to thy spirit's vision given
<dt>To gaze upon the splendors of that shore
<dt>Eye had not seen, nor heart conceived before.
<dt>Then didst thou, Poet Laureate of heaven,
<dt>Sing of those courts and of that angel host,
<dt>Of that majestic Spirit who in vain
<dt>Dared, warred, and fell, never to rise again,
<dt>And of that Paradise so early lost,
<dt>In strains "posterity shall not let die,"
<dt>In "thoughts that wander through eternity."
<p>
<a name="015"></a><h2>Prometheus</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Thou brave old Titan, that in chains didst lie,
<dt>Bound to the rock on the Caucasian hill,
<dt>Who by sublime endurance didst defy
<dt>Imperial Jove and all his shapes of ill;
<dt>As I invoke thy spirit here to-day,--
<dt>From the old Pagan world thou speak'st to me,
<dt>I hear thy voice across Time's sounding sea,
<dt>Bid me thus bear and conquer.--I obey.
<dt>Henceforth, like thee, I will endure and wait
<dt>On life's bleak summit bound, without dismay.
<dt>Then in thine iron car roll on thy way,
<dt>Thou stern, relentless power that men call Fate,
<dt>Loose then thy bolts thou dark and threat'ning sky--
<dt>Thou vulture at my heart, feed to satiety!</dt>
