<p>
<dt>Sometimes when all the world seems gray and dun
<dt>And nothing beautiful, a voice will cry,
<dt>"Look out, look out! Angels are drawing nigh!"
<dt>Then my slow burdens leave me, one by one,
<dt>And swiftly does my heart arise and run
<dt>Even like a child, while loveliness goes by--
<dt>And common folk seem children of the sky,
<dt>And common things seem shap&eacute;d of the sun.
<dt>Oh, pitiful! that I who love them, must
<dt>So soon perceive their shining garments fade!
<dt>And slowly, slowly, from my eyes of trust
<dt>Their flaming banners sink into a shade!
<dt>While this earth's sunshine seems the golden dust
<dt>Slow settling from that radiant cavalcade.
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>Sweet Weariness</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Fatigue itself may be a pleasant thing
<dt>And weariness be silken, soft and fine!
<dt>Upon my eyes its little vapors shine,
<dt>Trailing me softly like a colored wing!
<dt>Tender as when belov&eacute;d voices sing
<dt>It steals upon me and with touch divine
<dt>Lulls all my senses till each thought of mine
<dt>Is hushed to quiet, unremembering.
<dt>Oh, weariness thrice dear, so frailly spun
<dt>Of ended pleasure that still shines and glows;
<dt>Oh, weariness, thrice dear! What have I done
<dt>To earn this delicate and deep repose?
<dt>Child, thou hast worshiped at the setting sun
<dt>And looked, long, long, upon the opening rose.
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>The Wound</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Wounded am I, yet happier--happier far
<dt>Than they who have not felt the precious sting!
<dt>Poor feet that bleed not with this wandering!
<dt>Poor hands that burn not, plucking at a star!
<dt>Poor hearts unblessed and whole! I bear the scar
<dt>Of a too piercing loveliness. The thing
<dt>Hung out of reach I touched, and now I sing
<dt>Mad with delight, more blessed than others are.
<dt>For since the blushing and ethereal hour
<dt>When loveliness upon my heart was born,
<dt>When I was stricken by her magic power,
<dt>I run--I run--wild, ecstasied, forlorn,
<dt>For beauty, when I go to pluck her flower,
<dt>Pierces my willing bosom with a thorn.
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>A Sonnet for the Earth</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When I am weary for delight and spent,
<dt>Even as a bird that tries too long its wings
<dt>Will nest awhile amid the grass and sings,
<dt>So I drop downward from the wonderment
<dt>Of timelessness and space, in which were blent
<dt>The wind, the sunshine and the wanderings
<dt>Of all the planets--to the little things
<dt>That are my grass and flowers and am content.
<dt>Or if in flight my wings should beat so far
<dt>From the kind grass that is so cool and deep
<dt>That it must poise among the winds on high--
<dt>Yet will I sing to thee from star to star,
<dt>Piercing thy sunshine, and will always keep
<dt>A song for thee amid the farthest sky.
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>My Foolish Deeds</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When I, before the altars of repose,
<dt>Invited Slumber, she refused to stay,
<dt>But with a broken heart she turned away,
<dt>Astonished quite. Among the flaunting shows
<dt>That circled round, she perished like a rose
<dt>Cast among flames. Oh, bring her back--I pray!
<dt>Then sternly to my heart a voice said, "Nay,
<dt>Thou canst not have her--tearfully she goes."
<dt>God might not join us,--for gorgeous, bright,
<dt>Adorned, conspicuous, sure, without disguise,
<dt>Strangely illumined with derisive light
<dt>They danced -- they danced! Oh, then I was made wise!
<dt>My foolish deeds, flaming before my eyes,
<dt>Denied me slumber all the livelong night.

<a name=newyork></a><h1>Sonnets for New York City</h1>
<a name=006></a><h2>I. New York at Sunrise</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When with her clouds the early dawn illumes
<dt>Our doubtful streets, wistful they grow and mild
<dt>As if a sleeping soul grew happy and smiled,
<dt>The whole dark city radiantly blooms.
<dt>Pale spires lift their hands above the glooms
<dt>Like a resurrection, delicately wild,
<dt>And flushed with slumber like a little child,
<dt>Under a mist, shines forth the innocent Tombs.
<dt>Thus have I seen it from a casement high.
<dt>As unsubstantial as a dream it grows.
<dt>Is this Manhattan, virginal and shy,
<dt>That in a cloud so rapturously glows?
<dt>Ethereal, frail, and like an opening rose,
<dt>I see my city with an enlightened eye.
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>II. A Political "Boss"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Has he no country? Is he of alien breed?
<dt>Is this land not his home? Oh, exiled one!
<dt>Stranger to his own kind, where does he run?
<dt>How he has shamed us, for the world to read!
<dt>Oh, carrion, prowling where this people bleed,
<dt>Grown fat upon disaster, hide from the sun!
<dt>A scornful nation asks, what has he done
<dt>With the public trust, the honor, and the need.
<dt>Not him with glorious hand will we indite,
<dt>Patriot, Statesman, in the Hall of Fame,
<dt>Nor will we let him flee into the night
<dt>Of safe oblivion! But oh--that name
<dt>For our sons' sons a moving hand shall write
<dt>In scarlet letters on the walls of Shame.
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>III. Shame on Thee, O Manhattan</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Shame on thee, O Manhattan, whom I love!
<dt>And shame on me that I have slept away
<dt>So many years while thy feet went astray!
<dt>O Thou--that should'st be white as any dove,
<dt>Thou Scarlet Woman! Is there no voice to move--
<dt>No hand to smite us? Even for this I pray--
<dt>Some terrible scourging that we have let the day
<dt>Darken around us while we saw thee rove.
<dt>Last night I heard thee cry. Thy wandering feet
<dt>Went bleeding by me. On thy ruined breast
<dt>I saw thee nurse a feeding child of flame!
<dt>Desolate, gorgeous, frantic along the street!
<dt>Ah, how I blushed in the dark that through my rest
<dt>I felt the burning garments of thy shame.
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>IV. The Fountain of Life</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>This day into the fields my steps are led.
<dt>I cannot heal me there! Row after row,
<dt>Thousands of daisies radiantly blow.
<dt>They have not brought from Heaven my daily bread!
<dt>But they are like a prayer too often said.
<dt>I have forgot their meaning, and I go
<dt>From the cold rubric of their gold and snow,
<dt>And the calm ritual, all uncomforted.
<dt>I want the faces! faces! remote and pale,
<dt>That surge along the city streets! The flood
<dt>Of reckless ones, haggard and spent and frail,
<dt>Excited, hungry! In this other mood
<dt>'T is not the words of the faith for which I ail,
<dt>But to plunge in the fountain of its living blood.
