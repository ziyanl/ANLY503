<h4>TO MISS HENRIETTA PRESTON JOHNSTON</h3>
<p>
<dt><i>In this small book I seek the sonnet's aid,</i>
<dt><i>Some pictures of the past in words to paint</i>
<dt><i>And show how seekers after God essayed</i>
<dt><i>To find him; patriarch and martyred saint</i>
<dt><i>And spotless sage free from all selfish taint</i>
<dt><i>And Christian knight and missionary mild,</i>
<dt><i>And how heaven answers to the heart's wild plaint,</i>
<dt><i>And wisdom cometh to the little child.</i>
<p>
<dt><i>But none of those whom I on earth have known</i>
<dt><i>Have sought God's will with a more strenuous quest,</i>
<dt><i>With eager prayer and thought of Him alone</i>
<dt><i>And anxious wish to do his least behest</i>
<dt><i>Than thou, my sister, earliest, dearest friend,</i>
<dt><i>To whom these autumn leaves with love I send.</i>
<p>
<h2>Prologue</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name=001></a><h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>T</b></font>HE bard who would the storied past rehearse,
<dt>What things the spirit wrought in word and deed,
<dt>Should strike a note unerring in his verse,
<dt>A cypher give that he who runs may read.
<dt>How answers then the sonnet to his need,
<dt>Its meter strained, its tangled sleave of rhyme,
<dt>The structural artifice true art must heed
<dt>Where stringent form and soaring thought should chime?
<dt>Art hath its phases; now it stands sublime
<dt>In Milton's marvellous imaginings;
<dt>Dryden's sonorous line stales not with time;
<dt>In woodnotes wild the Ayrshire ploughman sings:
<dt>So none need scorn the pipe as small for fame
<dt>By Petrarch blown and Browning's gentle dame.
<p>
<a name=002></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>I</b></font> leave the trumpet and full throated horn
<dt>Of epic to the leaders of the choir,
<dt>The martial strain, the sigh of love forlorn,
<dt>To him who smites the loud resounding lyre
<dt>And chants with lips touched by the sacred fire
<dt>Imperial themes of patriot fervor born,
<dt>The joy of combat and the noble ire
<dt>That withers wrong with fierce consuming fire.
<p>
<dt>My task, to show the patriarchs of the eld
<dt>And seekers after God by nature's light
<dt>And saints who witnessed truth in suffering;
<dt>Small pictures of the past by faith beheld,
<dt>That grants dim eyes a sacred second sight;
<dt>These in the sonnet's narrow bounds I sing.
<p>
<a name=003></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>T</b></font>HE search of man for God, the mightiest theme
<dt>That ever can his loftiest thought engage!
<dt>Is his clear vision but an idle dream,
<dt>The mind's mirage to lure the doubting sage
<dt>With phantom waters that can not assuage
<dt>His thirst devine, or are the spires that gleam
<dt>Above Heaven's battlements from age to age
<dt>To eyes unsealed, as real as they seem?
<p>
<dt>To him who sees them not, they are not; clod
<dt>Of crudest clay by spirit uninformed,
<dt>His body, breath and reason have their day
<dt>And into nothingness would pass away,
<dt>But that, by grace regenerate and warmed
<dt>To a new being, he may grope toward God.
<p>
<h1 align=center>The Windows of Heaven</h1>
<a name=004></a><h2>Reason</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>T</b></font>HE budding world was in its bloomstrewn prime,
<dt>And from it Nature rose, a temple vast;
<dt>Its architects, twin Titans, Space and Time,
<dt>Rested, their handiwork complete, when last
<dt>Into the pageant a new Being passed,
<dt>The one appointed in the splendid shrine
<dt>High priest, o'er all his soverein sway to cast
<dt>And fill the void with energy divine.
<dt>For all the beams from stars, moon, sun, that shine
<dt>Could not from Nature lift the dreary pall
<dt>Till on man's brow was set the imperial sign
<dt>Of the self-conscious soul that saw it all
<dt>In the clear light of reason, which to men
<dt>Came through the window opened from Heaven then.
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>Obedience</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>T</b></font>HE mighty temple of the human soul,
<dt>Lit through one only casement by a ray
<dt>Of natural reason, saw long ages roll
<dt>While mankind mouldered to a slow decay,
<dt>Because they yielded not to reason's sway,
<dt>But let false fiends crawl to the niches high
<dt>And foul forms squat in places where men pray;
<dt>So that 't were best this race corrupt should die.
<dt>But no! man hath a loftier destiny;
<dt>Knowledge gives light, but from the sloughs of sense
<dt>In vain the struggling soul essays to fly
<dt>Unless obedience leads the spirit hence.
<dt>Another window's radiance through the gloom
<dt>To Noah showed man's path from death and doom.
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>Faith</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>F</b></font>ROM the broad plains where wandering herdsmen dwelt
<dt>A Prince of Ur--men call him now a sheikh--
<dt>Of the colossal type, severe, antique,
<dt>Led off his bands. The Lord had kindly dealt
<dt>With him and his; his grateful spirit felt
<dt>The trust a son unto his father feels
<dt>As in his boyhood at that knee he kneels,
<dt>While all his fervent love and passions melt
<dt>Into a faith, unquenchable, supreme.
<dt>In God he trusts; from Heaven's high battlement
<dt>A blaze of glory fills his horsehair tent
<dt>And rolling splendors o'er his spirit stream;
<dt>His vision pierces Nature's lofty dome
<dt>And treads the fields where guardian angels roam.
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>The Law</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>F</b></font>ROM Egypt's teeming fields the Hebrews fled,
<dt>Passed the deep waters, tracked the desert sand,
<dt>Following his steps where'er the Seer led,
<dt>And to the Mountain came, an altar grand,
<dt>Reared in the waste by an Almighty hand,
<dt>That here Earth's self should smoke, and flames arise,
<dt>While royal Moses as High Priest should stand,
<dt>The tables twain to take, and sacrifice.
<dt>Then came the Law amid a nation's cries
<dt>Of fear and mad revolt from God's command
<dt>And lurid light that, issuing from the skies,
<dt>Made all the Earth, at last, a Holy Land;
<dt>Commandments forged to fetter men from wrong
<dt>But wrought by righteousness to weapons strong.
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>Inspiration</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>S</b></font>PIRIT Divine that o'er creation broods,
<dt>Filling with life the outer bounds of space
<dt>And thrilling further yet the amplitudes
<dt>Beyond the finite ken, Thou hast by grace
<dt>From Thy pure essence lent a spark, a trace,
<dt>Of Deity, in those benignant moods
<dt>Wherein the Infinite reveals His face
<dt>To holy men, but still their grasp eludes.
<p>
<dt>And thus to David's heaven-strung harp there came
<dt>Music that matched the worship of his song,
<dt>Remorse and penitence and words of flame;
<dt>And prophets spake with inspiration strong.
<dt>Before their eyes ages to come unroll,
<dt>And fire-touched lips recite the seraphs' scroll.
<p>
<h1 align=center>At the Barriers</h1>
<a name=009></a><h2>Pythagoras</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>G</b></font>OING down through the valley of Hades,
<dt>The immemorial dim dusk of the eld,
<dt>Of my daemon I ask whose grand shade is
<dt>That presence majestic, that form unexcelled;
<dt>And then by emotions prepotent impelled,
<dt>I say, as the hem of his raiment I touch,
<dt>"Dear Master, if thou hast in silence withheld
<dt>Some part of thy wisdom, of which thou hast much,
<dt>Teach me, I pray thee, in aid of mankind."
<dt>Pythagoras answered, "<i>One</i> thing is sure;
<dt>Man is deaf to the rhythm of nature, and blind
<dt>To its order. Physician, this thought is his cure;
<dt>That Kosmos is justly and wisely designed,
<dt>And its harmony sounds in the ears of the pure."
<p>
<h2>Socrates</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name=010></a><h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>I</b></font>N early Hellas, clear as crystal wave
<dt>In sky, in atmosphere, in minds of men,
<dt>Whether in frolic sport or discourse grave
<dt>Its thought ran riot, or beyond the ken
<dt>Of worshippers of idols of the den
<dt>Lifted its haughty head to probe the vault
<dt>And from Olympus force reply again,
<dt>The strong winged soul found in its flight no halt,
<dt>But to the empyreal sphere soared in assault.
<dt>So Socrates through myth and mystery saw,
<dt>And Plato strove the Idea to exalt
<dt>That veiled the Maker in unchanging Law;
<dt>Seekers for truth, in which for God they sought
<dt>And won the crown for which their souls had wrought.
<p>
<a name=011></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>W</b></font>HEN Socrates, he of the shabby robe,
<dt>Had earned from Athens the unjust decree
<dt>That sentenced him to death, because his probe
<dt>Had touched its self love, Pity said, "Go free,
<dt>Thy prison gates to-night unbarred shall be;
<dt>Walk forth, and in some happier clime thy fame
<dt>Will blossom yet to immortality,
<dt>Nor can detraction visit thee with blame."
<dt>"Nay , friends, have I not told you that there came
<dt>Unto mine inmost soul a potent voice
<dt>That bade me put all false conceit to shame
<dt>And place the common welfare first; no choice
<dt>Is left. For me the hemlock cup to take
<dt>Is better far than Athens' laws to break."

<dt>A smile ironical, a biting tongue,
<dt>The honied sarcasm of a bee that stung,
<dt>The arguments that puzzle and deceive,
<dt>The snares his crafty questions interweave!
<dt>And yet, O Socrates, how wise men hung
<dt>Upon thy words, those precious jewels flung
<dt>Unto a swinish multitude; it grieves
<dt>Our very souls that Plato's garnered sheaves
<dt>And worthy Xenophon's small talk is all
<dt>That from the buried past we can recall;
<dt>Small remnant of thy legacy it leaves.
<dt>One saying stays; that thou wouldst gladly die
<dt>To share with just men immortality.

<dt>These solemn auguries by seers made,
<dt>The sign that bodes, the portent that affrights,
<dt>The ghost of which the soldier is afraid,
<dt>The pomp of superstition's masquerade
<dt>Are passing dreams to Scipio, who delights
<dt>To climb with Plato the aerial grade
<dt>Of thought where calm Philosophy invites.
<dt>Conqueror of Carthage, there are loftier heights
<dt>To which thy soul shall rise; the captive maid
<dt>Free from all fear, the victory that excites
<dt>Nor wrath nor greed, these laurels shall not fade.
<dt>Thy clement soul in search of truth shall see
<dt>Three golden steps, to know, to do, to be.

<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>T</b></font>HE foremost man of all the world! Is't true?
<dt>His was a mind that grasped the whole of life,
<dt>That gazed with equal brow on calm and strife,
<dt>Gleaned what the past bequeathed, yet seized the new,
<dt>And saw the ages march in grand review.
<dt>The stern republic of an earlier day,
<dt>Rent into fragments, mouldering to decay,
<dt>Still felt the thirst to combat and subdue,
<dt>The instinct fierce the old paths to pursue
<dt>Which led to conquest and imperial sway.
<dt>This C&aelig;sar saw; and though his pathway lay
<dt>Across the muniments of time, he drew
<dt>Into his sovereign hand all that was old
<dt>And bade a new world from the germs unfold.
<p>
<a name=015></a><h2>Cicero</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt><font size="+2"><b>W</b></font>HEN martial Rome had stretched her conquering sword
<dt>Wide o'er the lands, Philosophy held sway
<dt>Where once ancestral gods had been adored.
<dt>Then rival sects made battle in word-play;
<dt>Stoic and Epicurean had his say,
<dt>And in the clash of tongues each felt assured
<dt>That he alone stood in the light of day.
<dt>Great Tully looked on, smiling, and endured
<dt>The babble till his patience was outworn,
<dt>Then, with full measure of his talents ten
<dt>And mental sinews trained in every school
<dt>And learning copious as rich Plenty's horn,
<dt>He grasped the problem old 'twixt gods and men,
<dt>To find in nature that one God must rule.
<p>
<a name=016></a><h2>Seneca</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>

<dt>Offspring of intelect and virtuous thought,
<dt>Possessing all things that men seek or prize,
<dt>Desiring most the things that good men ought,

<dt>Yet by the cruel irony of fate
<dt>Condemned to wear as chains what most men sought,
<dt>Rank, ease, power, wealth, the favor of the great,
<dt>He kept his steadfast eyes on virtue's gate,
<dt>But dared not enter it beyond retreat;
<dt>For, crouching near, envy and lynx-eyed hate
<dt>And murder foul watched his advancing feet.
<dt>His nerveless hand to cope with evil tried,
<dt>But lacking strength greatly to live,--he died.

<dt>Pointed in silence to his scourge and scar,
<dt>Or spoke to fainting hearts, "Who would be strong,--
<dt>Balm for the sores of peace, the wounds of war--
<dt>Must learn to suffer and to do no wrong."
<dt>His words, his life, to men a lesson gave

<dt>In one man lodged until his brain was whirled
<dt>With madness and untrammeled masterhood;

<dt>Stem or withstand corruption's poisonous tide,
<dt>So that belief, that aught of true or good
<dt>On earth remained, in human hearts had died,
<dt>But that, imperial power, thus deified,
<dt>Came to a youth, self centred, truly great,
<dt>Who made a chaste philosophy the bride

<dt>While slaves attained what Marcus only hoped.

<dt>"God's Kingdom is at hand; your only choice,
<dt>O wretched! is to turn from sin or die.
<dt>Bring forth good fruits; the poor man's needs supply;
<dt>Be just, be merciful. Behold the Lord,

<dt>A prophet I? Nay, but a Voice! The Word
<dt>That Was and Is comes like a seraph's sword
<dt>To bend brute force to the free spirit's sway,
