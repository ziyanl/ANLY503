<p>
<dt>South Africa, thou land of many dreams,
<dt>Whose children do but scanty harvests reap,
<dt>Whose many dreams have set again in sleep,
<dt>Though still one glowing crop in sunlight gleams;
<dt>Thou land of unfulfill'd, forgotten schemes,
<dt>Of pledge and promise--a pathetic heap,
<dt>Yet, yet, our hold upon thee will we keep.
<dt>Thy havens, veld and kopjes, and thy streams!
<p></p>
<dt>We care not howsoe'er thy foes malign,
<dt>But those, the brood thou fosterest, we scorn,
<dt>Who only love the gifts that make them thine,
<dt>And honour not the land where they were born:
<dt>Thy children round thy neck will join their hands,
<dt>And rise to make thee blesséd among lands.

<a name="020"></a><h2>To Shakespeare</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<h3>(<i>From Johannesburg</i>)</h3>
<h3>A St. George's Day Sonnet</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>And here where throbs, amid a silent waste,
<dt>A myriad-hammer'd hum, whose Siren sound
<dt>Is heard re-echoing the world around,
<dt>Luring with golden hope who hither haste,
<dt>Guided by Fortune or by Furies chased,
<dt>To lose again such riches as they found,
<dt>While still the patient worker wins the ground
<dt>Where a new nation's future life is based,--
<dt>Even here is heard a voice to swell the praise
<dt>Of thy loved England, who did mother thee
<dt>And thy world-moving human pageantry;
<dt>Of thee, too, on whose glorious brow the bays
<dt>Will yet be green when, in dim æons to come,
<dt>Poets that sing of England will be dumb.
<p>
<a name="030"></a><h2>The Veld</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>From sky to sky the veld, vast, tawny, bare,
<dt>Surrounds me like a vision in a dream,
<dt>Mysterious and unreal: no flower or stream,
<dt>No friendly smoke or stack is anywhere;
<dt>E'en God's own living creatures are not there,--
<dt>No bird, no bough whereon to perch, no theme
<dt>Whereof to sing; to me there only seem
<dt>The sun, sky, veld, the light immaculate air.--
<dt>Whose great majestic archicraft did raise
<dt>This blue-domed temple without priest or psalm,
<dt>Without a tone of all the diapase,
<dt>With unascending incense without balm,
<dt>Without a worshipper in prayer or praise,
<dt>Mute with an incommunicable calm?
<p>
<a name="040"></a><h2>Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>With shimmering shoulders on the eastern steep
<dt>Came Dawn, grey, breathless in pursuit of Night:
<dt>His gold and sable mantle in his flight
<dt>Her trembling outstretch'd fingers could not keep.
<dt>A touch upon the folded wing of Sleep,
<dt>And he, too, sighing, slipp'd beyond her sight.
<dt>Then did her body on the Day alight
<dt>And glow, exhausted, in his bosom deep.
<p></p>
<dt>So Love, with vain endeavour, did pursue
<dt>A phantom fleet, or one who loved him not,
<dt>But ever fled from his approaching view--
<dt>A visage shunn'd regretted, unforgot,
<dt>And met with her whom only he could win,
<dt>Waiting, patient and warm, to take him in.
<p>
<a name="050"></a><h2>Solace</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>I lay beneath the Afric stars awake,
<dt>While all the neighbour-noise of city slept,
<dt>And all the solace of the silence crept
<dt>Into the turmoil of my spirit's ache;
<dt>And this worn heart, whereon life's billows break,
<dt>Was smoothed; the futile cares o'er which had wept
<dt>These weary eyes, where careless joys had leapt,
<dt>A slow and sweet transfiguring grace did take.
<p></p>
<dt>With wide lids open to the glorious night,
<dt>With soul and sense entranquill'd by the calm,
<dt>I lay awake, while in procession bright
<dt>The holy-hymning stars with spheric psalm
<dt>Bedew'd my inmost being with delight--
<dt>Yea, with the fragrance of enduring balm.</dt>
