<a name=100></a><h2>Summer Dawn</h2>
<p>
<dt>Pray but one prayer for me 'twixt thy closed lips,
<dt>Think but one thought of me up in the stars.
<dt>The summer night waneth, the morning light slips,
<dt>Faint and grey 'twixt the leaves of the aspen, betwixt the cloud-bars
<dt>That are patiently waiting there for the dawn:
<dt>Patient and colourless, though Heaven's gold
<dt>Waits to float through them along with the sun.
<dt>Far out in the meadows, above the young corn,
<dt>The heavy elms wait, and restless and cold
<dt>The uneasy wind rises; the roses are dun;
<dt>Through the long twilight they pray for the dawn,
<dt>Round the lone house in the midst of the corn,
<dt>Speak but one word to me over the corn,
<dt>Over the tender, bow'd locks of the corn.
<p>

<p>
<dt>She wavered, stopped and turned, methought her eyes,
<dt>The deep grey windows of her heart, were wet,
<dt>Methought they softened with a new regret
<dt>To note in mine unspoken miseries,
<dt>And as a prayer from out my heart did rise
<dt>And struggled on my lips in shame's strong net,
<dt>She stayed me, and cried "Brother!" our lips met,
<dt>Her dear hands drew me into Paradise.
<p>
<dt>Sweet seemed that kiss till thence her feet were gone,
<dt>Sweet seemed the word she spake, while it might be
<dt>As wordless music--But truth fell on me,
<dt>And kiss and word I knew, and, left alone,
<dt>Face to face seemed I to a wall of stone,
<dt>While at my back there beat a boundless sea.
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>The Doomed Ship</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The doomed ship drives on helpless through the sea,
<dt>All that the mariners may do is done
<dt>And death is left for men to gaze upon,
<dt>While side by side two friends sit silently;
<dt>Friends once, foes once, and now by death made free
<dt>Of Love and Hate, of all things lost or won;
<dt>Yet still the wonder of that strife bygone
<dt>Clouds all the hope or horror that may be.
<p>
<dt>Thus, Sorrow, are we sitting side by side
<dt>Amid this welter of the grey despair,
<dt>Nor have we images of foul or fair
<dt>To vex, save of thy kissed face of a bride,
<dt>Thy scornful face of tears when I was tried,
<dt>And failed neath pain I was not made to bear.
