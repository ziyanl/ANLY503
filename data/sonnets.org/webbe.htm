<p>
<dt>My little chirping fire, companion gay,
<dt>Whose merry gambols make me less alone,
<dt>A blessing on thy glee! Be ever known
<dt>At evening hour, when just the dying day
<dt>Hath made light sad.--Thou hast a pleasant way
<dt>Of muttering low, in many a little tone,
<dt>Quaint syllables--that scarcely from his own
<dt>The cricket knows, as pausing mid his play.
<p>
<dt>Sweet is thy precept in that listening hour;
<dt>Thou seemst to tell me with thy quiet mirth
<dt>How good is hope--regret how little worth:--
<dt>And perfect is thy love;--if fate but lour
<dt>When sharpest frost impends dost merriest burn.
<dt>The cold world leaves us,--thou, with kindlier burn.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>First Thoughts and Second Thoughts</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>First thoughts are good, and second thoughts are good;
<dt>Those most enrich us, these do best advise.
<dt>First thoughts are like first love, and us surprise
<dt>With sudden bliss--till second thoughts intrude
<dt>Fraught with wise doubts of much to be eschewed,
<dt>Not fit;--where yet the greater danger lies,
<dt>Lest while we doubt, the vision from our eyes
<dt>Offended pass--thereafter vainly wooed.
<p>
<dt>First thoughts are mistresses with heat pursued,
<dt>And mad devotion;--second thoughts are wives
<dt>Oft wed in over-prudence, and a mood
<dt>Most passionless.--He wiseliest contrives
<dt>Who adds the judgement while the love survives;
<dt>For so shall second thoughts, first thoughts include.
