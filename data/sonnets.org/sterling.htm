<h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>The morning is ten thousand miles away.
<dt>The winter night surrounds me, vast and cold,
<dt>Without a star. The voiceless fog is rolled
<dt>From ocean-levels desolate and grey;
<dt>But over all the floods of moonlight lay
<dt>A glory on those billows that enfold
<dt>The muffled sea and forest. Gaunt and old,
<dt>The dripping redwoods wait the distant day.
<p>
<dt>Unknown, above, what silver-dripping waves
<dt>Break slowly on the purple reefs of night!
<dt>What radiant foam ascends from shadowy bars,
<dt>Or sinks unechoing to soundless caves!
<dt>No whisper is upon those tides of light,
<dt>Setting in silence toward the risen stars.
<p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>O phantom sea, pale spirit of unrest!
<dt>There is no thunder where your billows break.
<dt>Morning shall be your strand; your waters make
<dt>An island of the mountain-top, whose crest
<dt>Is lonely on the ocean of your breast.
<dt>No sail is there save what our visions take
<dt>Of mist and moonlight, on whose ghostly wake
<dt>Our dreams go forth unuttered to the West.
<p>
<dt>The splendour on your tides is high and far,
<dt>Seen by the mind alone, whose wings can sweep
<dt>On wilder glories and a vaster deep.
<dt>Chill are your gulfs, O sea without a song!
<dt>Hiding the heavens from man, man from the star,
<dt>To which your parent sea endures as long.
