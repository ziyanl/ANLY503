<a name=010></a><h2>To Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Where art thou, Love, whose strange sweet light of yore
<dt>Made all the wide waste earth and seas and skies
<dt>As beautiful as erst was Paradise,
<dt>When our first parents learnt thy blissful lore?
<dt>Where art thou gone? The winds and waters war
<dt>'Gainst me defenceless, with unceasing strife,
<dt>My heart is famished, and my path of life
<dt>Unfruitful as a storm-tormented shore.
<p>
<dt>How dreadful is this world with thee away!
<dt>How coarse and common all beneath the sky,
<dt>If thou thy all-atoning grace deny!
<dt>O, Love! for thee I anguish, night and day;
<dt>And search the heavens, again and yet again,
<dt>For thy returning wings, but still in vain!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>As on a Hidden Voyage</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As on a hidden voyage fast confined
<dt>A captive in his dungeon hears forlorn
<dt>Free winds and waves, and muffled voices borne
<dt>From fleeting shores unknown, soon left behind;
<dt>And hearing, beats against his narrow walls
<dt>And strives to pierce them, that the moving skies
<dt>May lay his path in light before his eyes:
<dt>So hears my fettered soul, at intervals,
<dt>An outer world breathe near, and tries the bond
<dt>And compass of her prison, seeking still
<dt>To force some secret port, from whose wide sill
<dt>She, haply might look forth on light beyond,
<dt>And see, for weal or woe, in Truth's pure ray,
<dt>The mystery of Life's Voyage wane away.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Harmony</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It is not melody but harmony
<dt>That doth the Halls of Space with music fill:
<dt>The Universe was born of it, and still
<dt>In every atom lives and moves thereby.
<dt>Yea, each mere atom in that wondrous song
<dt>Hath its own part, and thence the stars arise
<dt>And set to harmony, and brotherwise
<dt>Bear one another's burdens and are strong.
<p>
<dt>But ah! the utt'rance of one note untrue,
<dt>How faint soever! then like pain or fear,
<dt>A sudden tremor runs from sphere to sphere,
<dt>And all Creation doth the discord rue;
<dt>E'en God's pure angels waver in their flight,
<dt>Though but a moment, to'ards the Throne of Light.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>After So Many Days</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>After so many days, dark days and dire,
<dt>In this wild land, the home of savage men,
<dt>To me, forlorn, 'neath alien stars, again
<dt>Life wears the splendour of Promethean fire.
<dt>I hear the harping of the Pleiad choir
<dt>Once more, once more the Music of the Spheres:
<dt>Back to my hand Olympian Clio bears
<dt>The seven-stringed foe of sorrow, the sweet lyre.
<p>
<dt>Is this the valley where I groped astray,
<dt>Huge mountain shadows making dark my way?
<dt>How strangely fair! at each step fairer yet!
<dt>And lo! an awful and a lovely sight,
<dt>One far-off peak of calm, unearthly light,
<dt>God's great white throne, it seems, in Heaven set.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>By fond heroic names, in days of old
<dt>I spoke of thee, and did not think to fear
<dt>Thy presence, and what time thy step drew near
<dt>I stood in loneliness, serenely bold,
<dt>Ready to greet thee--waiting to behold
<dt>(Such was my faith) great love within thine eyes
<dt>Benign, and light of light from Paradise,
<dt>That should grow brighter as my heart grew cold.
<p>
<dt>Now all is changed! Thou, winter, spare the bough
<dt>Where love has built her dear and fragile nest!
<dt>Oh, for the nestlings' sake! and hers whose breast
<dt>Protects them, how I hate thee! hate thee! Thou
<dt>Hast laid thy hand upon my heart, cruel Death,
<dt>And lest I shriek aloud I bar my breath.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>On His Seventieth Birthday</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Now from my sum of life full seventy years
<dt>Have borne to my great Master their report,
<dt>Wherein, recorded to the slightest thought,
<dt>The story of my vanished past appears.
<dt>Soon will He call me, and not unawares,
<dt>Hence from His vineyard where I stand, with naught
<dt>But poor, unprofitable service wrought,
<dt>Counting the long array of sad arrears.
<p>
<dt>And then? A faint voice faintly understood
<dt>Replies: "He that created thee did mark,
<dt>Yea, search thee altogether, and foreknew,
<dt>Ere the first fibre of thy body grew,
<dt>Ere yet thy spirit kindled from the dark--
<dt>Can he renounce thee and His Fatherhood?"
