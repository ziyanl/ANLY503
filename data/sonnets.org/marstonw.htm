<p>
<dt>In that tranced hush when sound sank awed to rest,
<dt>Ere from her spirit's rose-red, rose-sweet gate
<dt>Came forth to me her royal word of fate,
<dt>Did she sigh "Yes," and droop upon my breast;
<dt>While round our rapture, dumb, fixed, unexpressed
<dt>By the seized senses, there did fluctuate
<dt>The plaintive surges of our mortal state,
<dt>Tempering the poignant ecstasy too blest.
<p>
<dt>Do I wake into a dream, or have we twain,
<dt>Lured by soft wiles to some unconscious crime,
<dt>Dared joys forbid to man? Oh, Light supreme,
<dt>Upon our brows transfiguring glory rain,
<dt>Nor let the sword of thy just angel gleam
<dt>On two who entered heaven before their time!

<h3>An Inference</h3>
<p>
<dt>If I had lived ere seer or priest unveiled
<dt>A life to come, methinks that, knowing thee,
<dt>I should have guessed thine immortality;
<dt>For Nature, giving instincts, never failed
<dt>To give the ends they point to. Never quailed 
<dt>The swallow, through air-wilds, o'er tracts of sea,
<dt>To chase the summer; seeds that prisoned be
<dt>Dream of and find the daylight. Unassailed
<dt>By doubt, impelled by yearnings for the main,
<dt>The creature river-born doth there emerge;
<dt>So thou, with thoughts and longings which our earth
<dt>Can never compass in its narrow verge,
<dt>Shalt the fit region of thy spirit gain,
<dt>And death fulfil the promptings of thy birth.
