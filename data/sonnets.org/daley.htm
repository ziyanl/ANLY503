<p>
<dt>Last night, as one who hears a tragic jest, 
<dt>I woke from dreams, half-laughing, half in tears;
<dt>Methought that I had journeyed in the spheres
<dt>And stood upon the Planet of the Blest
<dt>And found thereon a folk who prayed with zest
<dt>Exceeding, and through all their painful years
<dt>Like strong souls struggled on 'mid hopes and fears;
<dt>"Where dwell the gods," they said, "we shall find rest."
<dt>The gods?  What gods, I thought, are those who so
<dt>Inspire their worshippers with faith that flowers
<dt>Immortal? and who make them keep aglow
<dt>The flames forever on their altar-towers?
<dt>"Where dwell these gods of yours?" I asked--and lo!
<dt>They pointed upwards to this earth of ours!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The awful seers of old who wrote, in words
<dt>Like drops of blood, great thoughts that through the night
<dt>Of ages burn, as eyes of lions light
<dt>Deep jungle-dusks; who smote with songs like swords
<dt>The soul of man on its most secret chords,
<dt>And made the heart of him a harp to smite--
<dt>Where are they? Where that old man lorn of sight,
<dt>The king of song among these laurelled lords?
<dt>But where are all the ancient singing-spheres
<dt>That burst through chaos like the summer's breath
<dt>Through ice-bound seas where never seaman steers?
<dt>Burnt out. Gone down. No star remembereth
<dt>These stars and seers well-silenced through the years--
<dt>The songless years of everlasting death.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Life</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What know we of the dead, who say these things,
<dt>Or of the life in death below the mould--
<dt>What of the mystic laws that rule the old
<dt>Grey realms beyond our poor imaginings
<dt>Where death is life? The bird with spray-wet wings
<dt>Knows more of what the deeps beneath him hold.
<dt>Let be! Warm hearts shall never wax a-cold,
<dt>But burn in roses through eternal springs;
<dt>For all the vanished fruit and flower of Time
<dt>Are flower and fruit in worlds we cannot see,
<dt>And all we see is as a shadow-mime
<dt>Of things unseen, and Time that comes to flee
<dt>Is but the broken echo of a rhyme
<dt>In God's great epic of Eternity.
