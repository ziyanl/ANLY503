<a name=010></a><h2>The Cow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>This is a rune I ravelled in the still,
<dt>Arrogant stare of an Australian cow--
<dt>"These prankt intruders of the hornless brow,
<dt>Puffed up with strange illusions of their skill
<dt>To fence, to milk, to fatten and to kill,
<dt>Once worshipped me with temple, rite and vow,
<dt>Crowned me with stars, and bade rapt millions bow
<dt>Before what abject guess they called my will!
<dt>Today this flunkey of my midden, Man,
<dt>Throws child-oblations in my milking-byre,
<dt>Stifles in slums to spare me lordly fields,
<dt>Flatters with spotless consorts my desire,
<dt>And for a pail of cream his birthright yields,
<dt>As once in Egypt, Hellas, Ind, Iran!"
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Australia</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Last sea-thing dredged by sailor Time from Space,
<dt>Are you adrift Sargasso, where the West
<dt>In halcyon calm rebuilds her fatal nest?
<dt>Or Delos of a coming Sun-God's race?
<dt>Are you for light, and trimmed, with oil in place,
<dt>Or but a Will o' Wisp on marshy quest?
<dt>A new demesne for Mammon to infest?
<dt>Or lurks millennial Eden 'neath your face?
<dt>The cenotaphs of species dead elsewhere
<dt>That in your limits leap and swim and fly,
<dt>Or trail uncanny harpstrings from your trees,
<dt>Mix omens with the auguries that dare
<dt>To plant the Cross upon your forehead sky,
<dt>A virgin helpmate Ocean at your knee.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>True America's Message</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Our manlier spirits hear and will obey
<dt>The Word <font size="-1">YOU</font> waft Australia o'er the sea--
<dt>'Be true, be brave, be merciful, be free!'
<dt>Not you, who, braggart, sent this wan array
<dt>Of hell-ships vomiting their Will-to-Slay,
<dt>These armoured Hates and pallid Envies we,
<dt>'Mid rattled mobs and flags hysteric, see
<dt>Tarnish the chaste horizon of our Bay:
<p>
<dt>But <font size="-1">YOU</font> we hear, our Comrades of the Cause,
<dt>Who face hyaena Mammon in his den:
<dt>And <font size="-1">YOU</font>, who dared your seas of blood to spill
<dt>To drag the swooning slave from vampire jaws:
<dt>Yea, <font size="-1">YOU</font> who freed unborn Australia, when
<dt>You singed King George's beard at Bunker's Hill.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Love's Substitute</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>This love, that dares not warm before its flame
<dt>Our yearning hands, or from its tempting tree
<dt>Yield fruit we may consume, or let us claim
<dt>In Hymen's scroll of happy heraldry
<dt>The twining glyphs of perfect you and me --
<dt>May kindle social fires whence curls no blame,
<dt>Find gardens where no fruits forbidden be,
<dt>And mottoes weave, unsullied by a shame.
<p>
<dt>For, love, unmothered Childhood wanly waits
<dt>For such as you to cherish it to Youth:
<dt>Raw social soils untilled need Love's own verve
<dt>That Peace a-flower may oust their weedy hates:
<dt>And where Distress would faint from wolfish sleuth
<dt>The perfect lovers' symbol is "We serve!"  
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Our Duty</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Yet what were Love if man remains unfree,
<dt>And woman's sunshine sordid merchandise:
<dt>If children's Hope is blasted ere they see
<dt>Its shoots of youth from out the branchlets rise:
<dt>If thought is chained, and gagged is Speech, and Lies
<dt>Enthroned as Law befoul posterity,
<dt>And haggard Sin's ubiquitous disguise
<dt>Insults the face of God where'er men be?
<p>
<dt>Ay, what were Love, my love, did we not love
<dt>Our stricken brothers so, as to resign
<dt>For Its own sake, the foison of Its dower:
<dt>That, so, we two may help them mount above
<dt>These layers of charnel air in which they pine,
<dt>To seek with us the Presence and the Power?
<p>

<p>
<dt>Too many a Samsan lip your teeth indent:
<dt>Too many a Sybil girl you lure to make
<dt>The Great Refusal for a fireside sake:
<dt>And glamoured poet many a look has sent
<dt>Into those eyeballs bear-brown, somnolent,
<dt>Nor dreamed that devils in each muddy lake
<dt>Were sucking his devotion in to slake
<dt>The furrowed belly of your fanged content!
<dt>Religion's bane and Freedom's subtlest foe!
<dt>Behold the poppied freight your barges bring
<dt>The dim-lit souls that crave the prophet's gleam,
<dt>Or fettered people's writhing 'neath their woe--
<dt>Gossamer clips and thriftless harvesting
<dt>Of phantom flocks and shadowy tilth of dream!
<p>
<a name=110></a><h2>Sloth (II)</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My dreams dissolve the day's illusive net:
<dt>While crested Action's billows blinding beat,
<dt>Omniscient Eyes in troughs of Faith I meet:
<dt>I wait with ancient stars until they set
<dt>Lest forward progress should their runes forget:
<dt>I am the rest that makes the bar complete:
<dt>And, in the shackled body of Defeat,
<dt>The womb of Baby Triumph living yet!
<dt>I am the blende of sleeping radiance:
<dt>The Siding where belated Industry
<dt>Draws from a Silent Tank tomorrow's zest:
<dt>Prophetic Art's preparatory Trance:
<dt>Dilating Force's Sabbath systole:
<dt>The Night of Brahm when worn Creators rest!
<p>
<a name=120></a><h2>Envy</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Black drips the ooze that you secrete on all
<dt>That Honour's burin graves or Love holds dear:
<dt>At sacrifice you laugh, at virtue sneer,
<dt>And sour rebellion's must, the waking thrall
<dt>Would ripen into Freedom, with the gall
<dt>Of green suspicion. God of drones, you hear
<dt>Mutter of plots in all Success: on seer
<dt>And saint behold your own foul motives crawl.
<dt>O Gluttony that would but dare not gorge!
<dt>Theft of the heart that dreads the handcuff! Hate,
<dt>Too cowardly to hurl the bolts you forge!
<dt>And Lust that fears to pluck the flowers you smell!
<dt>Too low your lintel to seduce the great!
<dt>The meanest of the Seven doors of Hell!
