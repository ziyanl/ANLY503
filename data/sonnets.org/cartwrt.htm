<p>
<dt>Chained to the oar and hopeless of reprieve,
<dt>From year to year to one dull task confined--
<dt>A task that needs no effort of the mind,
<dt>A task mere honest dulness might achieve--
<dt>Tell me, sincerely, though too proud to grieve
<dt>Or murmur at thy destinies unkind,
<dt>Dost thou not feel at least the chains that bind
<dt>Thy spirit down to toils it must not leave?
<p>
<dt>To have decked the shrine of Ceres with the flowers
<dt>That science gave to thy collecting hand;
<dt>To have served, by useful arts, thy native land:
<dt>These were thy hopes; on these were bent thy powers.
<dt>These hopes foregone, repress thy vain desires;
<dt>Curb thy aspiring soul and quench her useless fires.
