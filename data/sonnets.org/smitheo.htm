<p>
<dt>When thou didst leave me, Hope, why didst thou not,
<dt>In place of thy sweet presence leave Despair,
<dt>With her grim visage and distorted hair?
<dt>The past, the future, then had been forgot--
<dt>The soul, concentred on its blasted lot,
<dt>Had rested mute and desolate of care--
<dt>Had ceased to question where its treasures were,
<dt>And roamed no more the melancholy spot.
<dt>But now, too much remembering of the past
<dt>So huge the weight of gloom around me spread
<dt>That I, like one within a charnel cast,
<dt>Hear but the dirges ringing for the dead--
<dt>Feel all the pangs of life, and thought, and breath,
<dt>Yet walk I all the time with hand in hand of Death.

<a name=020></a><h2>A Summer Morning Picture</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The Sabbath morning from the night awoke
<dt>All sunshine crowned: rough men disdaining toil
<dt>Had cleared their brows from work-day's hardening moil
<dt>And by the fountain left the cove'd yoke.
<dt>Through morning-glory and the hollyhock,
<dt>And rich nasturtium, shading with their coil
<dt>The cottage window, and the heated soil,
<dt>Aslant the white board floor the sunshine broke,
<dt>And left a flowery tracery in the sheen.
<dt>This inward gleam the children newly kempt,
<dt>And genial matron, calm from work-day ways,
<dt>Who sits with stately grace her flock between
<dt>And sings a Sabbath hymm, meseems, exempt
<dt>Like these from strife, Seraphim Legions join the praise.

<p>
<dt>A simple thing, yet chancing as it did,
<dt>When life was bright with its illusive dreams,
<dt>A pledge and promise seemed beneath it hid
<dt>The ocean lay before me, tinged with beams
<dt>That lingering draped the west, a wavering stir;
<dt>And at my feet down fell a worn gray quill:
<dt>And eagle, high above the darkling fir,
<dt>With steady flight, seemed there to take his fill
<dt>Of that pure ether breathed by him alone.
<dt>O noble bird! why didst thou loose for me
<dt>Thy eagle plume? still unessayed, unknown,
<dt>Must be that pathway fearless winged by thee:
<dt>I ask it not, no lofty flight be mine;
<dt>I would not soar like thee, in loneliness to pine!
