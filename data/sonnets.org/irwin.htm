<p>
<dt>The rough green wealth of wheaten fields that sway
<dt>In the low wind of midsummer all day;
<dt>The morning valley's warm perfumed breeze
<dt>Floating from southern sycamore shadowed rills,
<dt>The singing forest on the dawn-topped hills,
<dt>The living depth of azure spacing seas:
<dt>Still, brooding shadows upon mossy walls,
<dt>Aerial vapours crumbling down the heights,
<dt>Silence of woods amid green mellow lights,
<dt>And sighs of distant drizzling waterfalls:
<dt>The sweet faint breath of the short moonlit nights
<dt>From misty meadows where the quaint crake calls;
<dt>Rare pageants in the western day withdrawn,
<dt>And fleets of rich light-laden clouds at dawn.
</p>
<p>

<p>
<dt>The rainbow o'er the sea of afternoon
<dt>Whence comes the fresh sound of the distant wave;
<dt>The mirrored lights that roof the lonely cave,
<dt>Where roll the waters from the rising moon;
<dt>The airs that stir the grasses on the grave,
<dt>And whisper spirit-like to one beneath,
<dt>That love in Summer grieves no more for death:
<dt>The first sweet secret touch of lips grown dear
<dt>In happy twilight woods when none are near;
<dt>Sweet fancies just awaked at morn, when still
<dt>The level red cloud lies beyond the hill:--
<dt>Such are the thoughts and objects that appear,
<dt>To lap in sacred sadness, or inspire
<dt>Thy strings to Beauty's moods, oh, Summer lyre.
</p>
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Regions of soft clear air, of cold green leaves,
<dt>Heaths, grasses, solitary as a sea:
<dt>Vistas of gold and violet radiancy,
<dt>Isles where the surge and the lone wave-bird grieves;
<dt>White-citied plains, hill-cinctured, whence there flow
<dt>Eurotean rivulets pellucidly
<dt>'Mid laurels, reeds, blue lilies;--in the glow
<dt>A cape, with sheep, and ruins like ripe sheaves;
<dt>Fallen columns smooth as aged ivory:
<dt>Some citadel remote or rocky pyre
<dt>The sunset turns to purple and to fire;
<dt>Gardens of thyme and groves of olives brown
<dt>Along the slopes Olympian vapours crown,
<dt>Like gods in commune, formless, divine and dire.
</p>

<p>
<dt>Remote from smoky cities, aged and grey,
<dt>I pass the long-drawn Summer sea-side day:
<dt>Now reading in the garden arbour where
<dt>In light and silence comes the freckled morn
<dt>When dews are on the leaf, and cool the air;
<dt>The faint wave wash is heard the beach along,
<dt>Whence a warm wind waves languidly the corn;
<dt>And poised in haze the lark shakes out her song;
<dt>Now hearing in deep grass the sweeping scythe,
<dt>And, in the sultry stillness voices blythe,
<dt>'Till day is done. Blue coolness comes once more:
<dt>The reapers bind in twilight the last sheaf,
<dt>And the fresh spring-tide foams the sloaky reef
<dt>As floats the white moon up the lonely land.
</p>
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>V</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Into the wood at close of rainy day
<dt>I walk, dim cloud above, green leaves around;
<dt>Upon the humid air only the sound
<dt>Of drop on drop stirring the stillness grey:
<dt>Almost I hear the rose leaves fall away
<dt>Too heavily weighed with damp to cling o'er-blown
<dt>To their wet branches straggling o'er the copse;
<dt>Until the faint waved twilight airs entone
<dt>Tide-like along the blossom'd beech tree-tops;
<dt>And amid showers and flowers scattering, alone
<dt>Pass from the fresh dusk solitude among
<dt>Meadows in clouded moonlight, glimmeringly
<dt>Seen like the low blue hills; and hear the song
<dt>Of the last bird, and wash of the cool sea.
</p>
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>VI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Awakened, I behold through dewy leaves
<dt>Wavering in the air, the pale dawn's level glow;
<dt>And hear the sparrow's twitter on the eaves,
<dt>The engine's quick steam throb, the first cock's crow:
<dt>And soon a prayer-bell toll, remote and slow:
<dt>And then a-while with light-reclosed eyes
<dt>I float upon my pillow as a cloud,
<dt>Unto a land whose snowy ruins rise
<dt>Along a plain girt by blue mountains proud;
<dt>And under solitary Egerean skies,
<dt>Bright verdure and bright marbles, in a dell
<dt>Deserted, where within a recluse well,
<dt>Through leafy lights I see a nymph's face beam,
<dt>Which fades not when in daylight dies my dream.
</p>
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>VII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Upon an upland orchard's sunny side,
<dt>I pass the quiet blue September day:
<dt>There winds through tented fields they sometimes hide,
<dt>Past woods and meadows green, the dusty way,
<dt>Down to the ship-speckled level of the bay,
<dt>And amber sands in crescent spreading wide.
<dt>Last night the winds were in the trees, and here
<dt>In golden moss a few red apples lie,
<dt>And from the copse a thrush flutes strong and clear,
<dt>And faintly humming flits the emerald fly:
<dt>All things autumnalised are rich and calm;
<dt>Steam-plumed argosies surge up the main,
<dt>And o'er the singing woodlands breathing balm,
<dt>One superb white cloud passes, dropping rain.
</p>
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>VIII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The apples ripen under yellowing leaves,
<dt>And in the farm yards by the little bay
<dt>The shadows come and go amid the sheaves,
<dt>And on the long dry inland winding way:
<dt>Where, in the thinning boughs each air bereaves,
<dt>Faint sunlights golden, and the spider weaves.
<dt>Grey are the low-laid sleepy hills, and grey
<dt>The autumn solitude of the sea day,
<dt>Where from the deep 'mid-channel, less and less
<dt>You hear along the pale east afternoon
<dt>A sound, uncertain as the silence, swoon--
<dt>The tide's sad voice ebbing toward loneliness:
<dt>And past the sands and seas' blue level line,
<dt>Ceaseless, the faint far murmur of the brine.
</p>
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>IX</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>An isle of trees full foliaged in a meadow,
<dt>Along whose quiet grassy shores below
<dt>The white sheep bathe in level lengths of shadow,
<dt>And sweet airs amiable as summer blow
<dt>Warmly and faint among the happy leaves,
<dt>Loving each other in a green repose
<dt>Folded; or waking in the slumbrous glow
<dt>Where the wind passing, indolently weaves
<dt>A net of lazy listless whisperings,
<dt>Most like the liquid lullaby of springs
<dt>Pulsing demure and quaintly in some cool
<dt>Dell of the woods; unseen save of some ray
<dt>Piercing the boughs, having somewhat to say
<dt>To fairies couched on bubbles round the pool.
</p>

<p>
<dt>When I had turned Catullus into rhyme,
<dt>And stars shone from the sea's blue southern zone,
<dt>Breathing in slumber tranquil as my own,
<dt>Above those pages of the antique time
<dt>Laid in a casement near me, where the vines
<dt>Trembled their shade: lo! on a sudden rose
<dt>Beautiful Venus naked amid glows
<dt>Of roseate cloud, and all the Lesbian lines
<dt>With her white finger touching as she smiled,
<dt>Stooped her, and kissed them, for a space beguiled,
<dt>'Till with a sigh she vanished. Then above
<dt>The sheaf of song in darkness I beheld
<dt>Impassioned foreheads as of poet gods
<dt>Bend their gold curls, and o'er them muse enspelled;
<dt>And wild and epic music from their abodes,
<dt>Heard blend in the high night with those of love.
</p>
<p>
<a name=011></a><h2>XI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Ye two fair trees that I so long have known
<dt>And loved, as living over dust so dear;
<dt>Who silently have seen tear after tear
<dt>Rise from my heart, when to the engraved stone
<dt>I came to pray, and with true love alone
<dt>Live back old times, amid a world so drear
<dt>With cares and changes of a many a year,
<dt>And loss of most things I could love or own:
<dt>Now 'mid the calm of this blue April noon
<dt>While the fresh wind breathes warm from the clear west,
<dt>Put fancy once more with thy leaves in tune
<dt>Green genial Muse of the grey grave:--for soon
<dt>By the dear dust it roofs, I too shall rest.
</p>
<p>
<a name=012></a><h2>XII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A roadside inn this summer Saturday:--
<dt>The doors are open to the wide warm air,
<dt>The parlour, whose old window views the bay,
<dt>Garnished with cracked delph full of flowers fair
<dt>From the fields round, and whence you see the glare
<dt>Fall heavy on the hot slate roofs and o'er
<dt>The wall's tree shadows drooping in the sun.
<dt>Now rumbles slowly down the dusty street
<dt>The lazy drover's clattering cart; and crows
<dt>Fainter through afternoon the cock; with hoes
<dt>Tan-faced harvest folk trudge in the heat:
<dt>The neighbours at their shady doors swept clean,
<dt>Gossip, and with cool eve fresh scents of wheat,
<dt>Grasses and leaves, come from the meadows green.
</p>
<p>
<a name=013></a><h2>XIII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I walk of grey noons by the old canal
<dt>Where rain-drops patter on the autumn leaves,
<dt>Now watching from some ivied orchard wall
<dt>In slopes of stubble figures pile the sheaves;
<dt>Or under banks in shadow of their grass,
<dt>Blue water-flies by starts jettingly pass
<dt>'Mid large leaves level on the glassy cool;
<dt>Or noiseless dizzy midges winking round
<dt>The yellow sallows of the meadow pool;
<dt>While into cloudy silence ebbs each sound,
<dt>And sifts the moulting sunlight warm and mellow
<dt>O'er sandy beach remote, or slumberous flood,
<dt>Or rooky, red brick mansion by the wood,
<dt>Mossed gate, or farmyard hay-stacks tanned and yellow.
</p>
<p>
<a name=014></a><h2>XIV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Now, winter's dolorous days are o'er, and through
<dt>March morning casements comes the sharp spring air,
<dt>And noises from the distant city, where
<dt>The steeples stand up keenly in the blue:
<dt>No more the clouds by crispy frost defined,
<dt>Pile the pale North, but float, dispersed shapes;
<dt>Though still around the cool grey twilight capes,
<dt>The sullen sea is dark with drifts of wind.
<dt>Like a forgotten fleck of snow still left,
<dt>The cascade gleams in the far mountain cleft;
<dt>Brown rushes by the river's brimming bank
<dt>Rustle, and matted sedges sway and sigh,
<dt>Where grasses in sleek shallows waver dank,
<dt>Or drift in windy ripples greyly by.
</p>
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>Spring</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Blow, summer wind, from yonder ocean blow
<dt>Along the wild sea banks and grasses drear,
<dt>And loamy shores, where mosses brown and sere
<dt>And pale pinks in the sandy ridges grow;
<dt>Float round yon promontory in the brine,
<dt>Whose stretching arm in deepest azure lies,
<dt>Where quiet browse the heavy-uddered kine
<dt>By rock and shining shallow, grey and clear;
<dt>And fill, this listless hour, the dreamy ear
<dt>With thy scarce toned and wordless harmonies:
<dt>For here with Nature will I rest, and please
<dt>My heart with sweetest fancies all the noon,
<dt>Until the limpid crescent of the moon
<dt>Lights the blue east above the evening trees.
