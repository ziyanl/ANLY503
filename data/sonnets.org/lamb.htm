<a name=050></a><h2>To My Friend, the Indicator</h2>
<P>
<dt>Your easy Essays indicate a flow,
<dt>Dear friend, of brain which we may elsewhere seek;
<dt>And to their pages I and hundreds owe,
<dt>That Wednesday is the sweetest of the week.
<dt>Such observation, wit, and sense, are shown,
<dt>We think the days of Bickerstaff return'd;
<dt>And that a portion of that oil you own,
<dt>In his undying midnight lamp which burn'd.
<dt>I would not lightly bruise old Priscian's head
<dt>Or wronog the rules of grammar understood;
<dt>But, with the leave of Priscian be it said,
<dt>The <i>Indicative</i> is your <i>Potential Mood</i>.
<dt>Wit, poet, prose-man, party-man, translator--
<dt><a href="#999">H</a>, your best title yet is <i>Indicator</i>.
</P>
<a name=075></a><h2>Saint Crispin to Mr. Gifford</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>All unadvised and in an evil hour,
<dt>Lured by aspiring thoughts, my son, you doft
<dt>The lowly labours of the "Gentle Craft"
<dt>For lowly toils, which blood and spirits sour.
<dt>All things, dear pledge, are not in all men's power;
<dt>The wiser sort of shrub affects the ground;
<dt>The sweet content of mind is oftener found
<dt>In cobbler's parlour than in critic's bower.
<dt>The sorest work is what doth cross the grain;
<dt>And better to this hour you had been plying
<dt>The obsequious awl, with well-wax'd finger flying,
<dt>Than ceaseless thus to till a thankless vein:
<dt>Still teasing muses, which are still denying;
<dt>Making a stretching-leather of your brain.
</P>
<a name=100></a><h2>"A timid grace sits trembling in her eye"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>A timid grace sits trembling in her eye,
<dt>As loth to meet the rudeness of men's sight,
<dt>Yet shedding a delicious lunar light
<dt>That steeps in kind oblivious ecstasy
<dt>The care-crazed mind, like some still melody:
<dt>Speaking most plain the thoughts which do possess
<dt>Her gentle sprite: peace, and meek quietness,
<dt>And innocent loves, and maiden purity:
<dt>A look whereof might heal the cruel smart
<dt>Of changed friends, or fortune's wrongs unkind:
<dt>Might to sweet deeds of mercy move the heart
<dt>Of him who hates his brethren of mankind.
<dt>Turned are those lights from me, who fondly yet
<dt>Past joys, vain loves, and buried hopes regret.
</P>
<a name=200></a><h2>"As when a child..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>As when a child on some long winter's night
<dt>Affrighted clinging to its Grandam's knees
<dt>With eager wond'ring and perturbed delight
<dt>Listens strange tales of fearful dark decrees
<dt>Muttered to wretch by necromantic spell;
<dt>Or of those hags, who at the witching time
<dt>Of murky midnight ride the air sublime,
<dt>And mingle foul embrace with fiends of Hell:
<dt>Cold Horror drinks its blood! Anon the tear
<dt>More gentle starts, to hear the Beldame tell
<dt>Of pretty babes, that loved each other dear,
<dt>Murdered by cruel Uncle's mandate fell:
<dt>Ev'n such the shiv'ring joys thy tones impart,
<dt>Ev'n so thou, <a href="#999">Siddons</a>! meltest my sad heart!
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>On the Sight of Swans in Kensington Garden</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Queen-bird, that sittest on thy shining nest
<dt>And thy young cygnets without sorrow hatchest,
<dt>And thou, thou other royal bird, that watchest
<dt>Lest the white mother wandering feet molest:
<dt>Shrined are your offspring in a crystal cradle,
<dt>Brighter than Helen's ere she yet had burst
<dt>Her shelly prison. They shall be born at first
<dt>Strong, active, graceful, perfect, swan-like, able
<dt>To tread the land or waters with security,
<dt>Unlike poor human births, conceived in sin,
<dt>In grief brought forth, both outwardly and in
<dt>Confessing weakness, error, and impurity.
<dt>Did heavenly creatures own succession's line,
<dt>The births of heaven like to yours would shine.
