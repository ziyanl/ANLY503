<dt>My heart was heavy, for its trust had been
<dt>Abused, its kindness answered with foul wrong;
<dt>So, turning gloomily from my fellow-men,
<dt>One summer Sabbath day I strolled among
<dt>The green mounds of the village burial-place;
<dt>Where, pondering how all human love and hate
<dt>Find one sad level; and how, soon or late,
<dt>Wronged and wrongdoer, each with meekened face,
<dt>And cold hands folded over a still heart,
<dt>Pass the green threshold of our common grave,
<dt>Whither all footsteps tend, whence none depart,
<dt>Awed for myself, and pitying my race,
<dt>Our common sorrow, like a mighty wave,
<dt>Swept all my pride away, and trembling I forgave!

<p>
<dt>Outbound, your bark awaits you. Were I one
<dt>Whose prayer availeth much, my wish should be
<dt>Your favoring trad-wind and consenting sea.
<dt>By sail or steed was never love outrun,
<dt>And, here or there, love follows her in whom
<dt>All graces and sweet charities unite,
<dt>The old Greek beauty set in holier light;
<dt>And her for whom New England's byways bloom,
<dt>Who walks among us welcome as the Spring,
<dt>Calling up blossoms where her light feet stray.
<dt>God keep you both, make beautiful your way,
<dt>Comfort, console, and bless; and safely bring,
<dt>Ere yet I make upon a vaster sea
<dt>The unreturning voyage, my friends to me.
