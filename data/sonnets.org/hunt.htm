<a name=100></a><h2>To a Fish</h2><img align=right src="fish.gif">
<P>
<dt>You strange, astonished-looking, angle-faced,
<dt>Dreary-mouthed, gaping wretches of the sea,
<dt>Gulping salt-water everlastingly,
<dt>Cold-blooded, though with red your blood be graced,
<dt>And mute, though dwellers in the roaring waste;
<dt>And you, all shapes beside, that fishy be,--
<dt>Some round, some flat, some long, all devilry,
<dt>Legless, unloving, infamously chaste:--
<p>
<dt>O scaly, slippery, wet, swift, staring wights,
<dt>What is't ye do? What life lead? eh, dull goggles?
<dt>How do ye vary your vile days and nights?
<dt>How pass your Sundays? Are ye still but joggles
<dt>In ceaseless wash? Still nought but gapes, and bites,
<dt>And drinks, and stares, diversified with boggles?
</P>
<a name=200></a><h2>A Fish Answers</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Amazing monster! that, for aught I know,
<dt>With the first sight of thee didst make our race
<dt>For ever stare! O flat and shocking face,
<dt>Grimly divided from the breast below!
<dt>Thou that on dry land horribly dost go
<dt>With a split body and most ridiculous pace,
<dt>Prong after prong, disgracer of all grace,
<dt>Long-useless-finned, haired, upright, unwet, slow!
<p>
<dt>O breather of unbreathable, sword-sharp air,
<dt>How canst exist? How bear thyself, thou dry
<dt>And dreary sloth? What particle canst share
<dt>Of the only blessed life, the watery?
<dt>I sometimes see of ye an actual <i>pair</i>
<dt>Go by! linked fin by fin! most odiously.
</P>
<a name=300></a><h2>To the Grasshopper and the Cricket</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Green little vaulter in the sunny grass,
<dt>Catching your heart up at the feel of June,
<dt>Sole voice that's heard amidst the lazy noon,
<dt>When even the bees lag at the summoning brass;
<dt>And you, warm little housekeeper, who class
<dt>With those who think the candles come too soon,
<dt>Loving the fire, and with your tricksome tune
<dt>Nick the glad silent moments as they pass;
<dt>Oh sweet and tiny cousins, that belong
<dt>One to the fields, the other to the hearth,
<dt>Both have your sunshine; both, though small, are strong
<dt>At your clear hearts; and both were sent on earth
<dt>To sing in thoughtful ears this natural song:
<dt>Indoors and out, summer and winter,--Mirth.
<p>The above sonnet was written in competition with <a href="keats.htm#150">John Keats</a>.
<P>
<a name=400></a><h2>The Nile</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>It flows through old hushed Egypt and its sands,
<dt>Like some grave mighty thought threading a dream,
<dt>And times and things, as in that vision, seem
<dt>Keeping along it their eternal stands,--
<dt>Caves, pillars, pyramids, the shepherd bands
<dt>That roamed through the young world, the glory extreme
<dt>Of high Sesostris, and that southern beam,
<dt>The laughing queen that caught the world's great hands.
<dt>Then comes a mightier silence, stern and strong,
<dt>As of a world left empty of its throng,
<dt>And the void weighs on us; and then we wake,
<dt>And hear the fruitful stream lapsing along
<dt>'Twixt villages, and think how we shall take
<dt>Our own calm journey on for human sake.
<p>
<a name=500></a><h2>On Receiving a Crown of Ivy from John Keats</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It is a lofty feeling, yet a kind,
<dt>Thus to be topped with leaves;--to have a sense
<dt>Of honour-shaded thought,--an influence
<dt>As from great nature's fingers, and be twined
<dt>With her old, sacred, verdurous ivy-bind,
<dt>As though she hallowed with that sylvan fence
<dt>A head that bows to her benevolence,
<dt>Midst pomp of fancied trumpets in the wind.
<p>
<dt>It is what's within us crowned. And kind and great
<dt>Are all the conquering wishes it inspires,
<dt>Love of things lasting, love of the tall woods,
<dt>Love of love's self, and ardour for a state
<dt>Of natural good befitting such desires,
<dt>Towns without gain, and hunted solitudes.
<p>
<a name=510></a><h2>To Robert Batty, M.D., on His Giving Me a Lock of Milton's Hair</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It lies before me there, and my own breath
<dt>Stirs its thin outer threads, as though beside
<dt>The living head I stood in honoured pride,
<dt>Talking of lovely things that conquer death.
<dt>Perhaps he pressed it once, or underneath
<dt>Ran his fine fingers when he leant, blank-eyed,
<dt>And saw in fancy Adam and his bride
<dt>With their heaped locks, or his own Delphic wreath.
<p>
<dt>There seems a love in hair, though it be dead.
<dt>It is the gentlest, yet the strongest thread
<dt>Of our frail plant,--a blossom from the tree
<dt>Surviving the proud trunk; as if it said,
<dt>Patience and gentleness in power. In me
<dt>Behold affectionate eternity.
