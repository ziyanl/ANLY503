<a name=010></a><h2>Pines and the Sea</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Beyond the low marsh-meadows and the beach,
<dt>Seen through the hoary trunks of windy pines,
<dt>The long blue level of the ocean shines.
<dt>The distant surf, with hoarse, complaining speech,
<dt>Out from its sandy barrier seems to reach;
<dt>And while the sun behind the woods declines,
<dt>The moaning sea with sighing boughs combines,
<dt>And waves and pines make answer, each to each.
<dt>O melancholy soul, whom far and near,
<dt>In life, faith, hope, the same sad undertone
<dt>Pursues from thought to thought! thou needs must hear
<dt>An old refrain, too much, too long thine own:
<dt>'This thy mortality infects thine ear;
<dt>The mournful strain was in thyself alone.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Human Flower</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name=021></a><h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>In the old void of unrecorded time,
<dt>In long, slow aeons of the voiceless past,
<dt>A seed from out the weltering fire-mist cast
<dt>Took root--a struggling plant that from its prime
<dt>Through rudiments uncouth, through rock and slime,
<dt>Grew, changing form and issue--and clinging fast,
<dt>Stretched its aspiring tendrils--till at last
<dt>Shaped like a spirit it began to climb
<dt>Beyond its rugged stem, with leaf and bud
<dt>Still burgeoning to greet the sunlit air
<dt>That clothed its regal top with love and power,
<dt>And compassed it as with a heavenly flood
<dt>Until it burst in bloom beyond compare,
<dt>The world's consummate, peerless human flower.
<p>
<a name=022></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>Shall that bright flower the countless ages toiled
<dt>And travailed to bring forth--shall that rare rose,
<dt>Whose bloom and fragrance earth and heaven unclose
<dt>Their treasuries to enrich, by death be foiled?
<dt>Its matchless splendour trampled down and spoiled?
<dt>Shall that Celestial Love--who watched its throes
<dt>Through centuries of long struggles and of woes,
<dt>And freed it from the old Serpent round it coiled;
<dt>Who tended it, and reared its glorious head
<dt>Above the brambles and the poisonous marsh,
<dt>And shielded it when zones were cased in ice--
<dt>Leave it to perish when the summons harsh
<dt>Of death is rung,--or, ere its leaves are shed,
<dt>Transplant it to his realm of Paradise?
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Life and Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name=031></a><h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>O solemn portal, veiled in mist and cloud,
<dt>Where all who have lived throng in, an endless line,
<dt>Forbid to tell by backward look or sign
<dt>What destiny awaits the advancing crowd;
<dt>Bourne crossed but once with no return allowed:
<dt>Dumb, spectral gate, terrestrial yet divine;
<dt>Beyond whose arch all powers and fates combine,
<dt>Pledged to divulge no secrets of the shroud.
<dt>Close, close behind we step, and strive to catch
<dt>Some whisper in the dark, some glimmering light;
<dt>Through circling whirls of thought intent to snatch
<dt>A drifting hope--a faith that grows to sight;
<dt>And yet assured, whatever may befall,
<dt>That must be somehow best that comes to all.
<p>
<a name=032></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>If death be final, what is life, with all
<dt>Its lavish promises, its thwarted aims,
<dt>Its lost ideals, its dishonoured claims,
<dt>Its uncompleted growth? A prison wall,
<dt>Whose heartless stones but echo back our call;
<dt>An epitaph recording but our names;
<dt>A puppet-stage where joys and griefs and shames
<dt>Furnish a demon jesters' carnival;
<dt>A plan without a purpose or a form;
<dt>A roofless temple; an unfinished tale.
<dt>And men like madrepores through calm and storm
<dt>Toil, die to build a branch of fossil frail,
<dt>And add from all their dreams, thoughts, acts, belief,
<dt>A few more inches to a coral reef.

<h1>Seven Wonders of the World</h1>
<a name=040></a><h2>The Printing-Press</h2>
<p>
<dt>In boyhood's days we read with keen delight
<dt>How young Aladdin rubbed his lamp and raised
<dt>The towering Djin whose form his soul amazed,
<dt>Yet who was pledged to serve him day and night.
<dt>But Gutenberg evoked a giant sprite
<dt>Of vaster power, when Europe stood and gazed
<dt>To see him rub his types with ink. Then blazed
<dt>Across the lands a glorious shape of light,
<dt>Who stripped the cowl from priests, the crown from kings,
<dt>And hand in hand with Faith and Science wrought
<dt>To free the struggling spirit's limèd wings,
<dt>And guard the ancestral throne of sovereign Thought.
<dt>The world was dumb. Then first it found its tongue
<dt>And spake -- and heaven and earth in answer rung.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The Ocean Steamer</h2>
<p>
<dt>With streaming pennons, scorning sail and oar,
<dt>With steady tramp and swift revolving wheel,
<dt>And even pulse from throbbing heart of steel,
<dt>She plies her arrowy course from shore to shore.
<dt>In vain the siren calms her steps allure;
<dt>In vain the billows thunder on her keel;
<dt>Her giant form may toss and rock and reel
<dt>And shiver in the wintry tempest's roar;
<dt>The calms and storms alike her pride can spurn.
<dt>True to the day she keeps her appointed time.
<dt>Long leagues of ocean vanish at her stern --
<dt>She drinks the air, and tastes another clime,
<dt>Where men their former wonder fast unlearn,
<dt>Which hailed her coming as a thing sublime.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>The Locomotive</h2>
<p>
<dt>Whirling along its living freight, it came,
<dt>Hot, panting, fierce, yet docile to command --
<dt>The roaring monster, blazing through the land
<dt>Athwart the night, with crest of smoke and flame;
<dt>Like those weird bulls Medea learned to tame
<dt>By sorcery, yoked to plough the Colchian strand
<dt>In forced obedience under Jason's hand.
<dt>Yet modern skill outstripped this antique fame,
<dt>When o'er our plains and through the rocky bar
<dt>Of hills it pushed its ever-lengthening line
<dt>Of iron roads, with gain far more divine
<dt>Than when the daring Argonauts from far
<dt>Came for the golden fleece, which like a star
<dt>Hung clouded in the dragon-guarded shrine.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>The Telegraph and Telephone</h2>
<p>
<dt>Fleeter than time, across the Continent,
<dt>Through unsunned ocean depths, from beach to beach,
<dt>Around the rolling globe Thought's couriers reach.
<dt>The new-tuned earth like some vast instrument
<dt>Tingles from zone to zone; for Art has lent
<dt>New nerves, new pulse, new motion -- all to each,
<dt>And each to all, in swift electric speech
<dt>Bound by a force unwearied and unspent.
<dt>Now lone Katahdin talks with Caucasus;
<dt>The Arctic ice-fields with the sultry South,
<dt>The sun-bathed palm thrills to the pine-tree's call.
<dt>We for all realms were made, and they for us.
<dt>For all there is a soul, an ear, a mouth;
<dt>And Time and Space are naught. The mind is all.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>The Photograph</h2>
<p>
<dt>Phoebus Apollo, from Olympus driven,
<dt>Lived with Admetus, tending herds and flocks:
<dt>And strolling o'er the pastures and the rocks
<dt>He found his life much duller than in Heaven.
<dt>For he had left his bow, his songs, his lyre,
<dt>His divinations and his healing skill,
<dt>And as a serf obeyed his master's will.
<dt>One day a new thought waked an old desire.
<dt>He took to painting, with his colors seven,
<dt>The sheep, the cows, the faces of the swains,
<dt>All shapes and hues in forests and on plains.
<dt>These old sun-pictures all are lost, or given
<dt>Away among the gods. Man owns but half
<dt>The Sun-god's secret -- in the Photograph.
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>The Spectroscope</h2>
<p>
<dt>All honor to that keen Promethean soul
<dt>Who caught the prismic hues of Jove and Mars,
<dt>And from the glances of the dædal stars,
<dt>And from the fiery sun, the secret stole
<dt>That all are parts of one primeval Whole, --
<dt>One substance beaming through Creation's bars
<dt>Consent and peace, amid the chemic wars
<dt>Of gases and of atoms. Yonder roll
<dt>The planets; yonder, baffling human thought,
<dt>Suns, systems, all whose burning hearts are wooed
<dt>To one confession -- so hath Science caught
<dt>Those eye-beams frank, whose speech cannot delude, --
<dt>How of one stuff our mortal earth is wrought
<dt>With stars in their divine infinitude.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>The Microphone</h2>
<p>
<dt>The small enlarged, the distant nearer brought
<dt>To sight, made marvels in a denser age.
<dt>But Science turns with every year a page
<dt>In the enchanted volume of her thought.
<dt>The wizard's wand no longer now is sought.
<dt>Yet with a cunning toy the Archimage
<dt>May hear from Rome Vesuvius' thunders rage,
<dt>And earthquake mutterings underground are caught,
<dt>Alike with trivial sounds. Would there might rise
<dt>Some spiritual seer, some prophet wise,
<dt>Whose tactile vision would avert the woes
<dt>Born of conflicting forces in the state; --
<dt>Some listener to the deep volcanic throes
<dt>Below the surface -- ere we cry, "Too late!"
